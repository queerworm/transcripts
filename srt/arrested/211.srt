1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:02,002
male narrator: 
NOW THE STORY

2
00:00:02,002 --> 00:00:04,129
OF A WEALTHY FAMILY 
WHO LOST EVERYTHING

3
00:00:04,129 --> 00:00:06,005
AND THE ONE SON 
WHO HAD NO CHOICE

4
00:00:06,005 --> 00:00:07,007
BUT TO KEEP THEM ALL TOGETHER.

5
00:00:13,429 --> 00:00:15,723
IT'S ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT.

6
00:00:18,643 --> 00:00:21,771
narrator: MICHAEL WAS HAVING 
BRUNCH WITH SALLY SITWELL.

7
00:00:21,771 --> 00:00:23,106
- I STILL CAN'T BELIEVE 
WE GOT IN.

8
00:00:23,106 --> 00:00:25,108
THIS PLACE IS 
USUALLY SO PACKED ON SUNDAYS.

9
00:00:25,108 --> 00:00:27,818
narrator: IN ADDITION TO 
ITS SUNDAY POPULARITY,

10
00:00:27,818 --> 00:00:29,404
THE BISTRO WAS ALSO FAMOUS

11
00:00:29,404 --> 00:00:31,656
FOR SOMETHING CALLED 
THE SKIP'S SCRAMBLE,

12
00:00:31,656 --> 00:00:34,825
AN EGG DISH THAT CONTAINED 
EVERYTHING ON THE MENU.

13
00:00:34,825 --> 00:00:36,786
DON'T ORDER THE SKIP'S SCRAMBLE.

14
00:00:36,786 --> 00:00:37,995
- JUST MORE GOOD LUCK.

15
00:00:37,995 --> 00:00:40,998
EVERYTHING'S BEEN GOING SO WELL 
SINCE WE STARTED GOIN' OUT.

16
00:00:40,998 --> 00:00:43,543
I THINK WE'VE ACTUALLY 
GONE OUT EIGHT TIMES NOW.

17
00:00:43,543 --> 00:00:45,253
narrator: 
WHICH INCLUDED A RECORD-TYING.

18
00:00:45,253 --> 00:00:47,797
THREE LOVEMAKING SESSIONS 
IN ONE NIGHT FOR MICHAEL.

19
00:00:47,797 --> 00:00:48,798
- YES!

20
00:00:48,798 --> 00:00:52,093
- JUST THINK HOW DIFFERENT 
EVERYTHING IN OUR LIVES WOULD BE

21
00:00:52,093 --> 00:00:53,969
IF WE'D GOTTEN TOGETHER 
IN HIGH SCHOOL.

22
00:00:53,969 --> 00:00:56,264
- OF COURSE, I WOULDN'T 
HAVE HAD GEORGE MICHAEL.

23
00:00:56,264 --> 00:00:57,557
WE PROBABLY WOULD'VE HAD

24
00:00:57,557 --> 00:01:00,185
AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT 
KIND OF CHILD.

25
00:01:00,185 --> 00:01:02,895
[man singing] 
MY LOVE IS A FIRE

26
00:01:02,895 --> 00:01:05,648
- I REALLY HOPE 
HE'S OKAY WITH US GOIN' OUT.

27
00:01:05,648 --> 00:01:06,649
WE'RE VERY CLOSE.

28
00:01:06,649 --> 00:01:08,109
WE DON'T KEEP ANYTHING 
FROM EACH OTHER.

29
00:01:08,109 --> 00:01:10,528
- OH, NO, IT'S MY DAD. 
I'M SUPPOSED TO BE AT WORK.

30
00:01:10,528 --> 00:01:13,656
- YOU KNOW, GEORGE MICHAEL, 
YOU WORRY TOO MUCH.

31
00:01:13,656 --> 00:01:14,865
IT'S SUNDAY.

32
00:01:14,865 --> 00:01:17,243
YOU'RE ALLOWED TO HAVE 
A COUPLE OF HOURS OFF.

33
00:01:17,243 --> 00:01:18,411
YOU DON'T SEE ME NERVOUS

34
00:01:18,411 --> 00:01:20,830
ABOUT BEING 
ON MY THIRD VIRGIN MARY.

35
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:21,831
- WHY WOULD YOU BE NERVOUS?

36
00:01:21,831 --> 00:01:23,416
THERE'S NO ALCOHOL 
IN A VIRGIN MARY.

37
00:01:23,416 --> 00:01:26,043
- THERE ISN'T? 
THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE.

38
00:01:26,043 --> 00:01:28,213
CAN I GET A VIRGIN PIÑA COLADA 
WHEN YOU GET A CHANCE?

39
00:01:28,213 --> 00:01:29,964
NOW WE'LL GET 
THINGS STARTED.

40
00:01:29,964 --> 00:01:32,925
- HI. THIS IS SO, UH-- 
I WAS JUST--

41
00:01:32,925 --> 00:01:34,552
HEY, OKAY.

42
00:01:34,552 --> 00:01:35,928
I WANT TO INTRODUCE YOU 
TO SALLY.

43
00:01:35,928 --> 00:01:36,929
- THIS IS GEORGE MICHAEL.

44
00:01:36,929 --> 00:01:39,474
MY NIECE, MAEBY. 
- IT'S NICE TO MEET YOU.

45
00:01:39,474 --> 00:01:41,559
- I JUST SHUT DOWN THE 
BANANA STAND FOR A HALF AN HOUR.

46
00:01:41,559 --> 00:01:43,353
YOU KNOW, I CAN KEEP IT 
OPEN LATE TONIGHT IF YOU--

47
00:01:43,353 --> 00:01:44,687
- NO. NO. 
HEY, COME ON.

48
00:01:44,687 --> 00:01:47,106
MAKE ME SOUND 
LIKE A TASKMASTER.

49
00:01:47,106 --> 00:01:50,151
BUT IF-- IF YOU WANT TO KEEP IT 
OPEN AN EXTRA HOUR.

50
00:01:50,151 --> 00:01:53,488
SO, THIS IS SALLY.

51
00:01:53,488 --> 00:01:56,073
- IS SHE YOUR GIRLFRIEND? 
- NO.

52
00:01:56,073 --> 00:01:57,074
YES!

53
00:01:57,074 --> 00:01:58,451
A LITTLE.

54
00:01:58,451 --> 00:01:59,452
- YOU KNOW WHAT?

55
00:01:59,452 --> 00:02:00,703
I'M GONNA MEET YOU 
IN A FEW MINUTES, OKAY?

56
00:02:00,703 --> 00:02:02,079
- OKAY.

57
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:04,582
- AND MAYBE WE'LL WORK ON 
BREAKING THAT RECORD, HUH?

58
00:02:04,582 --> 00:02:07,293
- OKAY.

59
00:02:07,293 --> 00:02:10,130
SHE'S A SHOT-PUTTER. 
AND I'M DATING HER.

60
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:11,256
BUT I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE

61
00:02:11,256 --> 00:02:12,632
THAT YOU'RE COMFORTABLE 
WITH EVERYTHING.

62
00:02:12,632 --> 00:02:14,049
- WELL, OF COURSE. 
WE COULD DOUBLE-DATE.

63
00:02:14,049 --> 00:02:16,219
YOU AND SALLY AND ME AND ANN.

64
00:02:16,219 --> 00:02:17,262
- WHO?

65
00:02:17,262 --> 00:02:18,763
- WHA--ANN.

66
00:02:18,763 --> 00:02:20,431
YES. YES. 
- YEAH, WE HAD--

67
00:02:20,431 --> 00:02:22,725
- OF COURSE I KNOW ANN. 
YEAH, SEE, I DIDN'T MEAN "WHO?"

68
00:02:22,725 --> 00:02:24,810
I MEANT, UH, "HER?"

69
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:25,936
THAT'S A GREAT IDEA.

70
00:02:25,936 --> 00:02:27,147
I LOVE ANN.

71
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:29,274
- GREAT.

72
00:02:29,274 --> 00:02:32,652
- EXCUSE ME, MA'AM.

73
00:02:32,652 --> 00:02:34,529
- GEORGE MICHAEL, YOU SAID THAT 
YOU COULDN'T COME TO CHURCH

74
00:02:34,529 --> 00:02:37,114
BECAUSE YOU WERE WORKING, 
AND NOW YOU'RE DOING NEITHER?

75
00:02:37,114 --> 00:02:39,450
THAT'S QUITE A LOT OF SINS 
FOR A SUNDAY AFTERNOON,

76
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:41,494
DON'T YOU THINK? 
- YOUR VIRGIN PIÑA COLADA.

77
00:02:41,494 --> 00:02:42,537
- AND NOW YOU'RE DRINKING?

78
00:02:42,537 --> 00:02:44,997
- NO. WE'RE JUST HAVING 
A LITTLE FUN, YOU KNOW.

79
00:02:44,997 --> 00:02:47,041
- I THINK THE CHURCH 
AND STUDYING ARE FUN.

80
00:02:47,041 --> 00:02:48,042
I THOUGHT 
YOU FELT THE SAME.

81
00:02:48,042 --> 00:02:50,545
- WELL, I DO. 
I--I LIKE NOT HAVING FUN.

82
00:02:50,545 --> 00:02:52,922
I LIKE YOUR IDEA OF FUN, 
I MEAN.

83
00:02:52,922 --> 00:02:57,968
OUR IDEA OF FUN. 
I LIKE NOT HAVING THAT.

84
00:02:57,968 --> 00:02:59,304
- I'M GOING BACK TO CHURCH.

85
00:02:59,304 --> 00:03:02,223
- WELL, SHE JUST KILLED MY BUZZ.

86
00:03:02,223 --> 00:03:05,100
SO, YOU'RE STILL 
ENJOYING THIS RELATIONSHIP?

87
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:06,185
- YOU KNOW, I MEAN, I GUESS

88
00:03:06,185 --> 00:03:08,438
WE'VE LOST SOME OF THE HEAT 
SINCE WE HAVE KISSED.

89
00:03:08,438 --> 00:03:10,147
I MEAN, 
HOW DO YOU RELIGHT THAT FIRE?

90
00:03:10,147 --> 00:03:11,607
YOU KNOW, BUT I CAN'T 
BREAK UP WITH HER.

91
00:03:11,607 --> 00:03:13,443
I ALWAYS JUST ASSUMED 
SHE WOULD BREAK UP WITH ME.

92
00:03:13,443 --> 00:03:18,197
- WELL, WE MAY HAVE TO FIND 
A WAY TO SPEED THAT PROCESS UP.

93
00:03:18,197 --> 00:03:20,366
narrator: AND LATER THAT DAY, 
MICHAEL CAUGHT LINDSAY UP

94
00:03:20,366 --> 00:03:23,786
ON THE EMOTIONAL BOND 
HE WAS FORMING WITH SALLY.

95
00:03:23,786 --> 00:03:25,120
- OH, BIG DEAL, THREE TIMES.

96
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,956
I'VE HAD THREE TIMES 
PLENTY OF TIMES.

97
00:03:26,956 --> 00:03:29,750
YES!

98
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:31,085
- DID YOU CALL MY NAME?

99
00:03:31,085 --> 00:03:33,212
- ABSOLUTELY NOT.

100
00:03:33,212 --> 00:03:34,380
- I JUST HOPE THAT 
GEORGE MICHAEL

101
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:35,381
IS REALLY OKAY WITH IT.

102
00:03:35,381 --> 00:03:37,800
- YOU KNOW, I THINK 
YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A REASON

103
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:38,884
THIS ISN'T GOING TO WORK BECAUSE

104
00:03:38,884 --> 00:03:41,929
YOU CAN'T HANDLE HAPPINESS, 
AND YOU LIKE TO SUFFER.

105
00:03:41,929 --> 00:03:46,141
- OH, HOW DELICIOUS!

106
00:03:46,141 --> 00:03:48,060
- OH, HEY, LET'S NOT SPIN 
IN THE COMFY CHAIR.

107
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:50,313
- LOOK AT THIS 
DELICIOUS PIECE OF IRONY.

108
00:03:50,313 --> 00:03:53,065
I'M BEING SUED FOR DIVORCE. 
ME.

109
00:03:53,065 --> 00:03:54,442
- THOUGHT YOU WERE SINGLE?

110
00:03:54,442 --> 00:03:56,193
- YEAH, I KEEP FORGETTING 
THAT I GOT MARRIED.

111
00:03:56,193 --> 00:03:57,945
narrator: 
GOB MET A WOMAN ONE NIGHT.

112
00:03:57,945 --> 00:04:01,366
AND AFTER 
A SERIES OF ESCALATING DARES,

113
00:04:01,366 --> 00:04:03,200
MARRIED HER.

114
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,077
- YES, BUT IT'S ALL 
COMING BACK TO ME NOW.

115
00:04:05,077 --> 00:04:06,579
SHE WAS A SEAL DEALER.

116
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:10,082
SHE RAISED AND SOLD SEALS 
TO AQUARIUMS AND MARINE PARKS,

117
00:04:10,082 --> 00:04:11,083
THAT SORT OF THING.

118
00:04:11,083 --> 00:04:12,752
THEN SHE WENT OFF 
TO FIGHT HER WAR

119
00:04:12,752 --> 00:04:13,753
AND LEFT ME 
TO LOOK AFTER THEM.

120
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:15,421
narrator: 
IT WAS WHILE IN THE SERVICE

121
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:19,634
THAT HER PENCHANT FOR DARING 
FOUND A NATURAL OUTLET.

122
00:04:20,926 --> 00:04:22,970
- I'VE NEVER KNOWN YOU 
TO LOOK AFTER A SEAL.

123
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:24,264
- TURNS OUT 
IT'S A MAJOR HASSLE.

124
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:25,806
TRIED TO INCLUDE ONE 
IN MY ACT ONCE.

125
00:04:25,806 --> 00:04:26,807
THERE'S A REASON THAT

126
00:04:26,807 --> 00:04:28,726
YOU DON'T TYPICALLY SEE 
LIVE SEALS IN A MAGIC SHOW.

127
00:04:28,726 --> 00:04:31,103
SO WITH A SIMPLE WAVE OF MY-- 
[barking]

128
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:34,148
OH, LOOK-IT OVER...THERE. 
[barking]

129
00:04:34,148 --> 00:04:36,859
WELL, ONE OF THE 
"DESPERATE HOUSEWIVES,"

130
00:04:36,859 --> 00:04:37,985
LOOKING SO DESPERATE.

131
00:04:37,985 --> 00:04:39,028
[cat screeching]

132
00:04:39,028 --> 00:04:40,863
SO I RELEASED THEM 
FROM WHENCE THEY CAME,

133
00:04:40,863 --> 00:04:42,657
AND NOW 
SHE'S STOMPING ON MY HEART.

134
00:04:42,657 --> 00:04:44,241
- WHAT'S HER FIRST NAME? 
QUICKLY.

135
00:04:44,241 --> 00:04:47,036
- KRINDY. 
- NAME'S NOT KRINDY, GOB.

136
00:04:47,036 --> 00:04:50,790
- AH, SAUL ZENTSMAN. 
NO, THAT'S HER LAWYER.

137
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:52,875
WELL, SHE'S GOT A NAME.

138
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:53,876
AND I'M GONNA 
FIND OUT WHAT IT IS,

139
00:04:53,876 --> 00:04:55,085
AND THEN I'M GONNA 
MAKE A PUN ON IT,

140
00:04:55,085 --> 00:04:56,211
AND THAT'S 
WHAT I'LL CALL HER.

141
00:04:56,211 --> 00:04:57,297
BAD EXAMPLE:

142
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:59,924
IF HER NAME'S AMY, 
I'LL CALL HER BLAMY.

143
00:04:59,924 --> 00:05:01,717
- THAT'S A STRONG DEFENSE. 
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT.

144
00:05:01,717 --> 00:05:03,260
I'LL HELP YOU LOOK 
FOR BARRY TOMORROW.

145
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:04,387
I THINK DAD PREPAID HIM

146
00:05:04,387 --> 00:05:06,931
FOR LINDSAY AND TOBIAS'S 
DIVORCE ANYWAY.

147
00:05:06,931 --> 00:05:08,015
- LOOK AT US.

148
00:05:08,015 --> 00:05:10,100
THREE RELATIONSHIPS, 
ALL FALLING APART.

149
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:11,561
MAYBE IT'S TIME WE ACTUALLY

150
00:05:11,561 --> 00:05:13,313
TOOK SOME 
RESPONSIBILITY FOR THAT.

151
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:14,814
- I THINK IT'S MOM'S FAULT.

152
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:16,649
- I WAS GONNA SAY 
THE EXACT SAME THING.

153
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:19,319
- [grinding] 
- NO, THAT'S NOT A SPINNER.

154
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:22,488
- SO THIS IS HOW MY CHILDREN 
SPEAK OF ME WHEN I'M NOT HERE.

155
00:05:22,488 --> 00:05:24,156
- WELL, WHAT ARE YOU 
DOIN' HERE, MOM?

156
00:05:24,156 --> 00:05:25,491
-  YOUR BROTHER BUSTER

157
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:27,535
WANTS TO MEET ME 
AT THE BEACH TOMORROW.

158
00:05:27,535 --> 00:05:29,161
DO YOU KNOW WHAT THIS IS ABOUT?

159
00:05:29,161 --> 00:05:31,121
BECAUSE IF IT'S ABOUT 
GOING IN THE OCEAN,

160
00:05:31,121 --> 00:05:33,708
THE ANSWER IS NO, 
HE'S NOT GOING IN THE OCEAN.

161
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:35,585
- WELL, THERE ARE 
BIGGER DANGERS, MOM.

162
00:05:35,585 --> 00:05:39,380
LIKE, SAY, SIGNING HIM UP 
FOR THE ARMY DURING WARTIME.

163
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:41,382
- WHAT THE HELL 
WAS I SUPPOSED TO DO?

164
00:05:41,382 --> 00:05:44,134
MICHAEL MOORE CONFRONTED ME 
IN FRONT OF THE WHOLE COUNTRY.

165
00:05:44,134 --> 00:05:45,135
- FIRST OF ALL, 
IT WASN'T MICHAEL MOORE.

166
00:05:45,135 --> 00:05:46,136
IT WAS 
A MICHAEL MOORE LOOK-ALIKE.

167
00:05:46,136 --> 00:05:47,805
AND IT WASN'T 
IN FRONT OF THE WHOLE COUNTRY.

168
00:05:47,805 --> 00:05:50,057
IT WAS FOR A BIT 
ON "JIMMY KIMMEL LIVE".

169
00:05:50,725 --> 00:05:53,811
- I DON'T KNOW WHO THAT IS, 
AND I DON'T CARE TO FIND OUT.

170
00:05:53,811 --> 00:05:55,062
narrator: 
BUT THE NEXT DAY,

171
00:05:55,062 --> 00:05:57,648
SHE DID 
FIND OUT WHAT BUSTER WANTED.

172
00:05:57,648 --> 00:05:59,609
- OKAY, I THINK WE HAVE ENOUGH 
OF YOU TWO KISSING.

173
00:05:59,609 --> 00:06:02,862
- OH, I CAN'T BELIEVE 
YOU HIRED A PHOTOGRAPHER.

174
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:06,073
WE HAVEN'T DONE THIS SINCE 
THE BALBOA BAY WINDOW MAGAZINE.

175
00:06:08,283 --> 00:06:10,995
- SO, I WANTED YOU TO HAVE 
A RECENT PICTURE OF ME,

176
00:06:10,995 --> 00:06:14,457
BECAUSE THEY WANT TO SHIP ME OUT 
TOMORROW WITH ARMY.

177
00:06:14,457 --> 00:06:16,959
- WHAT? 
TO WHERE?

178
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:18,335
- IRAQ.

179
00:06:18,335 --> 00:06:19,587
AND I JUST MIGHT BE 
OUT OF OPTIONS.

180
00:06:19,587 --> 00:06:21,338
I DON'T WANT TO GO, 
BUT THEY KEEP--

181
00:06:21,338 --> 00:06:22,590
- I KNOW WHAT THIS IS ABOUT.

182
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:24,592
YOU WANT TO GO SWIMMING 
IN THE OCEAN.

183
00:06:24,592 --> 00:06:25,760
WELL, YOU CAN FORGET IT.

184
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,470
- I DON'T THINK 
THAT'S WHAT THIS IS ABOUT.

185
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:28,471
- YES, IT IS.

186
00:06:28,471 --> 00:06:30,598
- HE'S TRYING TO PUNISH ME 
OR SOMETHING.

187
00:06:30,598 --> 00:06:32,683
WHATEVER HAPPENED 
TO "KEEPIN' IT FRESH"?

188
00:06:32,683 --> 00:06:34,560
- I WAS 30 YEARS OLD THEN, 
MOTHER.

189
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,186
I'M 32 NOW! 
- SHH.

190
00:06:36,186 --> 00:06:38,022
- AND I'M NOT TRYING 
TO TEACH YOU A LESSON.

191
00:06:38,022 --> 00:06:39,899
- WELL, I MAY NOT HAVE 
BEEN A PERFECT MOTHER.

192
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:41,817
BUT, YOU KNOW, 
KIDS DON'T COME WITH A HANDBOOK.

193
00:06:41,817 --> 00:06:42,818
narrator: IN FACT,

194
00:06:42,818 --> 00:06:45,279
THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF 
BOOKS WRITTEN ON CHILD-REARING.

195
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:47,364
BUT LUCILLE WAS IN DENIAL.

196
00:06:47,364 --> 00:06:49,992
- IF HE WANTS TO GO SWIMMING, 
LET HIM.

197
00:06:49,992 --> 00:06:52,119
narrator: 
AND BUSTER WAS FAR FROM READY

198
00:06:52,119 --> 00:06:53,663
TO GO SWIMMING IN THE OCEAN.

199
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:56,415
- [shudders]

200
00:06:56,415 --> 00:06:57,500
narrator: AND LATER,

201
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,502
MICHAEL AND GOB 
TRACKED DOWN THEIR ATTORNEY,

202
00:06:59,502 --> 00:07:00,878
BARRY ZUCKERKORN.

203
00:07:00,878 --> 00:07:02,755
-  THANK YOU SO MUCH 
FOR COMING DOWN HERE.

204
00:07:02,755 --> 00:07:04,298
I'VE GOT A BIG CASE.

205
00:07:04,298 --> 00:07:06,216
I'M REPRESENTING 
SKIP CHURCH'S RESTAURANT.

206
00:07:06,216 --> 00:07:07,217
- I DON'T CARE.

207
00:07:07,217 --> 00:07:08,928
- A WAITRESS THAT WORKS THERE 
IS CLAIMING

208
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:11,431
THAT BY EATING SKIP'S SCRAMBLE 
SEVERAL TIMES A WEEK

209
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:12,723
IS MAKING HER A FATTY.

210
00:07:12,723 --> 00:07:14,684
- WE NEED TO SPEAK TO YOU 
ABOUT GETTING A DIVORCE FOR GOB.

211
00:07:14,684 --> 00:07:17,227
- OH, WELL, I GOT MICHAEL OUT 
OF HIS MARRIAGE, DIDN'T I?

212
00:07:17,227 --> 00:07:18,563
- ACTUALLY, SHE DIED.

213
00:07:18,563 --> 00:07:20,064
- YOU'RE KIDDING ME.

214
00:07:20,064 --> 00:07:21,941
I'VE BEEN TAKING 
CREDIT FOR THAT FOR YEARS.

215
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:22,942
- CREDIT?

216
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:23,943
- WHO'S THEIR LAWYER?

217
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:25,402
- SAUL ZENTSMAN. 
DO YOU KNOW HIM?

218
00:07:25,402 --> 00:07:26,446
- I HAVE CHINESE WITH HIM

219
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:28,155
EVERY FRIDAY NIGHT 
AT MISS TEMPLE'S.

220
00:07:28,155 --> 00:07:29,156
HE'S TOUGH.

221
00:07:29,156 --> 00:07:30,658
- I JUST WANT MY WIFE BACK.

222
00:07:30,658 --> 00:07:31,909
- HEY, LET'S SAVE IT 
FOR THE STAND,

223
00:07:31,909 --> 00:07:32,910
OKAY, TOM JANE?

224
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:33,911
FINE.

225
00:07:33,911 --> 00:07:36,121
I'LL GET INTO THIS 
AS SOON AS I LOSE THIS CASE.

226
00:07:36,121 --> 00:07:37,790
YOU KNOW WHO'S 
DEFENDING THE FATTY?

227
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:38,874
MAGGIE LIZER.

228
00:07:38,874 --> 00:07:40,793
- MAGGIE LIZER, 
OUR OLD PROSECUTOR?

229
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:42,753
narrator: MICHAEL HAD AN AFFAIR 
WITH MAGGIE LIZER

230
00:07:42,753 --> 00:07:43,754
WHILE SHE WAS BOTH

231
00:07:43,754 --> 00:07:47,424
PRETENDING TO BE BLIND 
AND PROSECUTING THE FAMILY.

232
00:07:47,424 --> 00:07:50,553
IT WAS WITH HER HE'D FIRST SET 
THE THREE-TIME RECORD.

233
00:07:50,553 --> 00:07:52,304
- YES!

234
00:07:52,304 --> 00:07:53,764
narrator: 
THEIR RELATIONSHIP

235
00:07:53,764 --> 00:07:57,184
ENDED SOMEWHAT ABRUPTLY.

236
00:07:57,184 --> 00:07:58,686
- WOW. 
HOW DOES SHE LOOK?

237
00:07:58,686 --> 00:08:01,939
- WELL, SHE'S GET-- 
IF YOU ASK ME, BIGGER.

238
00:08:01,939 --> 00:08:03,357
narrator: SHE WAS BIGGER--

239
00:08:03,357 --> 00:08:05,150
- ARE YOU SURE YOU'RE 
OKAY TO GO ON?

240
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:06,777
narrator: 
BECAUSE SHE WAS PREGNANT.

241
00:08:06,777 --> 00:08:09,363
- IT'S NOT MY BELLY 
WE HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT,

242
00:08:09,363 --> 00:08:10,364
YOUR HONOR.

243
00:08:10,364 --> 00:08:12,282
IT'S LORETTA'S.

244
00:08:12,282 --> 00:08:16,036
BEING TEMPTED 
DAY IN AND DAY OUT

245
00:08:16,036 --> 00:08:19,540
BY THOSE SKIP'S SCRAMBLES.

246
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:21,834
BRING 'EM IN, BOYS.

247
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:25,462
- OH, I'M COOKED. 
THEY LOVE HER.

248
00:08:25,462 --> 00:08:26,506
TELL YOU THE TRUTH,

249
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:27,798
I PREFERRED IT 
WHEN SHE WAS BLIND.

250
00:08:27,798 --> 00:08:28,799
narrator: AND SO,

251
00:08:28,799 --> 00:08:30,843
MICHAEL CAUGHT UP 
WITH HIS ONE-TIME LOVER.

252
00:08:30,843 --> 00:08:33,888
- HOW YOU DOIN'? 
WOW, YOU LOOK...FANTASTIC.

253
00:08:33,888 --> 00:08:35,515
- WOW. 
HAVEN'T SEEN YOU

254
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:37,767
SINCE WE HAD AN AFFAIR 
AND YOU RUINED MY CAREER.

255
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:39,685
- YEAH, I WAS GONNA 
CALL YOU A COUPLE OF TIMES,

256
00:08:39,685 --> 00:08:41,061
AND THEN I JUST-- 
I GOT, YOU KNOW,

257
00:08:41,061 --> 00:08:43,689
I GOT TO THINKING, UH, 
"WHAT IF SHE BRINGS THAT UP?"

258
00:08:43,689 --> 00:08:44,690
- TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH,

259
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:48,569
I AM SO RELIEVED NOT TO BE 
PRETENDING TO BE BLIND ANYMORE.

260
00:08:48,569 --> 00:08:49,612
IT'S ACTUALLY TAUGHT ME

261
00:08:49,612 --> 00:08:53,616
NOT TO RELY ON CHEAP TRICKS 
TO GET THE JURY'S SYMPATHY.

262
00:08:53,616 --> 00:08:55,075
- I'M SORRY, I KNOW 
I'M NOT SUPPOSED TO DO THIS,

263
00:08:55,075 --> 00:08:57,119
BUT WE JUST SPEND 
SO MUCH TIME IN THAT BOX.

264
00:08:57,119 --> 00:08:58,954
- [gasps] 
- I KNITTED YOU SOMETHING.

265
00:08:58,954 --> 00:09:02,291
- OH, JUROR NUMBER FOUR! 
GOSH, THANK YOU.

266
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:05,670
I FEEL SO BAD I FOUGHT SO HARD 
TO KEEP YOU OFF THE JURY.

267
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:06,754
- OH-- 
- MS. LIZER...

268
00:09:06,754 --> 00:09:07,922
CAN I SEE YOU 
IN MY CHAMBERS?

269
00:09:07,922 --> 00:09:09,715
- OH. YES, YOUR HONOR.

270
00:09:09,715 --> 00:09:10,716
narrator: IN FACT,

271
00:09:10,716 --> 00:09:13,260
JUDGE PING 
HAD A GIFT FOR MAGGIE TOO--

272
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:15,596
AN OCEAN-SOUNDS TODDLER ROCKER

273
00:09:15,596 --> 00:09:18,223
HE'D ASKED HIS BAILIFF 
TO ASSEMBLE.

274
00:09:18,223 --> 00:09:19,559
- TOO BAD THE TRIAL'S 
NOT GOING ANY LONGER.

275
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:21,018
SHE COULD'VE KNIT YOU 
SOMETHING THAT FIT.

276
00:09:21,018 --> 00:09:23,270
- I KNOW. 
I'M SO BIG NOW.

277
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:25,439
- NO, NO, COME ON. 
THEY LOOK GREAT.

278
00:09:25,439 --> 00:09:26,982
YOU LOOK GREAT. 
YOU LOOK FANTASTIC.

279
00:09:26,982 --> 00:09:29,026
LAST TIME I SAW YOU WAS IN 
THAT JURY BOX RIGHT THERE,

280
00:09:29,026 --> 00:09:30,611
WASN'T IT? 
WASN'T IT LIKE A YEAR AGO?

281
00:09:30,611 --> 00:09:31,862
- OH, CHIP, YOU KNOW WHAT?

282
00:09:31,862 --> 00:09:33,781
CAN YOU TAKE THIS 
BACK TO MY HOUSE?

283
00:09:33,781 --> 00:09:36,701
[strains]

284
00:09:36,701 --> 00:09:39,662
ACTUALLY, IT'S BEEN 
ABOUT EIGHT AND A HALF MONTHS.

285
00:09:39,662 --> 00:09:41,288
- EIGHT AND A HALF MONTHS, HUH? 
WOW.

286
00:09:41,288 --> 00:09:43,874
I SEE SOMEBODY HAS BEEN 
COUNTING THE, UH--

287
00:09:45,542 --> 00:09:47,670
EIGHT AND A HALF MONTHS. 
WOW. REALLY?

288
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:49,504
COULD'VE SWORN IT WAS A YEAR.

289
00:09:52,549 --> 00:09:53,801
narrator: 
MICHAEL HAD JUST LEARNED...

290
00:09:53,801 --> 00:09:55,761
THAT THE WOMAN 
HE'D BEEN INTIMATE WITH

291
00:09:55,761 --> 00:09:57,847
EIGHT AND A HALF MONTHS EARLIER

292
00:09:57,847 --> 00:09:59,682
WAS EIGHT-AND-A-HALF 
MONTHS PREGNANT.

293
00:09:59,682 --> 00:10:01,058
- DIDN'T I USE SOMETHING?

294
00:10:01,058 --> 00:10:05,229
- NO. YOU THOUGHT 
I WAS BLIND, REMEMBER?

295
00:10:05,229 --> 00:10:06,230
DON'T WORRY.

296
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:07,231
YOU'RE NOT THE FATHER, MICHAEL.

297
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:08,315
- [exhales] 
- NO PROBLEM.

298
00:10:08,315 --> 00:10:09,316
- REALLY? 
- RIGHT.

299
00:10:09,316 --> 00:10:11,736
- YOU SURE? 
I MEAN, UH--I COULD BE, THOUGH.

300
00:10:11,736 --> 00:10:12,737
WHAT IF I WAS?

301
00:10:12,737 --> 00:10:14,279
DON'T YOU WANT TO DISCUSS THIS 
MAYBE A LITTLE BIT?

302
00:10:14,279 --> 00:10:16,198
- MICHAEL, 
I HAVEN'T HEARD FROM YOU.

303
00:10:16,198 --> 00:10:18,575
I--I REALLY DON'T WANT 
TO HEAR FROM YOU NOW.

304
00:10:18,575 --> 00:10:20,995
LISTEN, IF YOU'RE INTERESTED, 
COME TO THE BAPTISM.

305
00:10:20,995 --> 00:10:24,665
YOU CAN HURL A BIBLE 
AT THE BABY.

306
00:10:24,665 --> 00:10:27,001
narrator: AND THAT NIGHT, 
MICHAEL MET UP WITH SALLY,

307
00:10:27,001 --> 00:10:30,045
WHERE HE FELT HE NEEDED 
TO BE HONEST WITH HER.

308
00:10:30,045 --> 00:10:32,172
- SALLY...

309
00:10:32,172 --> 00:10:34,299
YOU NEED TO KNOW 
ABOUT MY CHILD.

310
00:10:34,299 --> 00:10:35,843
- GEORGE MICHAEL. 
HE APPROVES.

311
00:10:35,843 --> 00:10:39,054
- NO, THERE MAY BE 
ANOTHER CHILD IN THE MIX.

312
00:10:39,054 --> 00:10:41,265
I RAN INTO AN EX.

313
00:10:41,265 --> 00:10:43,475
WE HAD A VERY MESSED UP 
RELATIONSHIP.

314
00:10:43,475 --> 00:10:45,310
IT WAS BASED TOTALLY ON LIES.

315
00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:46,561
BUT SHE'S PREGNANT.

316
00:10:46,561 --> 00:10:47,562
SHE SAID SOMETHING

317
00:10:47,562 --> 00:10:49,606
THAT LED ME TO BELIEVE 
THAT IT MIGHT BE MINE.

318
00:10:49,606 --> 00:10:52,026
- BUT YOU SAID 
SHE WAS A LIAR.

319
00:10:52,026 --> 00:10:53,193
- SH-SHE IS.

320
00:10:53,193 --> 00:10:55,529
SHE SAID IT WASN'T MINE, SO--

321
00:10:55,529 --> 00:10:56,530
- WHY ARE YOU 
TELLING ME THIS?

322
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:57,614
- WELL, BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY

323
00:10:57,614 --> 00:10:58,658
IF IT IS MY CHILD,

324
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:00,159
I'M GONNA HAVE TO 
BE RESPONSIBLE FOR IT,

325
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:02,494
AND THAT'S GONNA MAKE THINGS 
AWFULLY COMPLICATED FOR US.

326
00:11:02,494 --> 00:11:03,495
- MICHAEL, YOU KNOW WHAT?

327
00:11:03,495 --> 00:11:06,791
YOU'RE ALWAYS LOOKING FOR 
THINGS TO GET BETWEEN US.

328
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:07,833
FIRST, IT WAS, 
"WHAT'S YOUR SON GONNA THINK?"

329
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:09,584
AND NOW YOU THINK 
YOU'RE HAVING A BABY,

330
00:11:09,584 --> 00:11:12,171
BECAUSE A WOMAN WHO LIES 
TOLD YOU YOU WEREN'T.

331
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:13,463
- THAT'S A GREAT WAY 
TO SAY THAT.

332
00:11:13,463 --> 00:11:16,383
WE REALLY DO COMMUNICATE WELL, 
DO YOU KNOW THAT?

333
00:11:16,383 --> 00:11:17,426
- ARE YOU INSANE?

334
00:11:17,426 --> 00:11:20,387
- YOU BROKE UP WITH HER BECAUSE 
SOMEBODY WHO DOESN'T WANT YOU

335
00:11:20,387 --> 00:11:22,014
MIGHT BE PREGNANT 
WITH YOUR BABY?

336
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:23,682
- NO, SALLY BROKE UP WITH ME.

337
00:11:23,682 --> 00:11:25,309
AND AS FOR MAGGIE,

338
00:11:25,309 --> 00:11:26,393
I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW 
THAT SHE WAS PREGNANT

339
00:11:26,393 --> 00:11:27,394
WHEN I FIRST SAW HER.

340
00:11:27,394 --> 00:11:29,814
ALL I COULD SEE WAS 
HER GIANT CHEST--BOX.

341
00:11:29,814 --> 00:11:31,774
SHE HAD THIS-- 
SOME PEOPLE CALL IT A CHEST.

342
00:11:31,774 --> 00:11:32,775
I CALL IT A BOX.

343
00:11:32,775 --> 00:11:34,151
SHE WAS HOLDING THIS GIANT BOX.

344
00:11:34,151 --> 00:11:35,527
MAYBE I SHOULD'VE 
JUST STAYED OUT OF IT.

345
00:11:35,527 --> 00:11:38,155
SHE DID MAKE IT PRETTY CLEAR 
THAT SHE DOESN'T WANT ME AROUND.

346
00:11:38,155 --> 00:11:39,698
- COME ON, MICHAEL.

347
00:11:39,698 --> 00:11:41,325
SHE'S PROBABLY 
NOT EVEN PREGNANT.

348
00:11:41,325 --> 00:11:43,410
YOU SAID 
SHE WAS CARRYING A BIG BOX?

349
00:11:43,410 --> 00:11:45,495
PREGNANT WOMEN 
TEND NOT TO DO THAT.

350
00:11:45,495 --> 00:11:49,166
- IT DID SAY "60 POUNDS" ON IT.

351
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:51,043
OKAY, I-I'VE DONE 
THIS WRONG.

352
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:52,753
I SHOULD'VE FOUND OUT 
WHETHER IT WAS A REAL PREGNANCY

353
00:11:52,753 --> 00:11:54,504
BEFORE I TOLD MY DREAM GIRL 
ABOUT IT.

354
00:11:54,504 --> 00:11:55,547
- YOU KNOW WHAT I DO, MIKE?

355
00:11:55,547 --> 00:11:56,715
CHECK THEIR URINE.

356
00:11:56,715 --> 00:11:57,716
MAKE 'EM PEE IN A CUP,

357
00:11:57,716 --> 00:11:59,468
AND PEE IN A CUP 
RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME.

358
00:11:59,468 --> 00:12:01,261
- YEAH, WELL, THANKS, GOB.

359
00:12:01,261 --> 00:12:03,513
BUT, UH, I THINK WE SHOULD 
JUST KEEP ON LOOKIN'.

360
00:12:03,513 --> 00:12:05,599
I DON'T KNOW HOW 
I CAN MAKE THAT SOUND LIKE ME.

361
00:12:05,599 --> 00:12:07,476
- SO YOU GET SOMEONE 
TO BREAK INTO HER HOUSE,

362
00:12:07,476 --> 00:12:08,853
RIG THE TOILET,

363
00:12:08,853 --> 00:12:11,688
COLLECT THE PEE, TEST IT, 
AND EXPOSE THE LIE.

364
00:12:11,688 --> 00:12:12,689
I MEAN, I'D DO IT,

365
00:12:12,689 --> 00:12:14,316
BUT I'M GOIN' 
THROUGH A DIVORCE HERE, GUY.

366
00:12:14,316 --> 00:12:17,027
- OH, A PREGNANCY TEST. 
[laughs]

367
00:12:17,027 --> 00:12:19,196
THERE'S SOMETHING 
WE NEVER HAD, HUH, LINDSAY?

368
00:12:19,196 --> 00:12:20,239
OH, NO.

369
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:23,158
WE HAD TO CREATE OUR 
LITTLE FRANKENSTEIN MONSTER

370
00:12:23,158 --> 00:12:26,328
OUT OF SCIENCE AND MONEY 
AND JUST A DASH OF--

371
00:12:26,328 --> 00:12:27,329
MAEBY, WHAT--

372
00:12:27,329 --> 00:12:28,914
H-HOW LONG HAVE YOU 
BEEN STANDING THERE?

373
00:12:28,914 --> 00:12:30,207
- I JUST WALKED IN.

374
00:12:30,207 --> 00:12:31,959
- JUST WALKED IN. 
[laughs]

375
00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:32,960
SEEMS LIKE ONLY YESTERDAY

376
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:36,046
YOU WERE BURSTING FORTH 
FROM YOUR MOTHER'S FERTILE WOMB.

377
00:12:36,046 --> 00:12:37,089
- YOU KNOW WHAT?

378
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:39,758
TOBIAS AND I WILL BREAK INTO 
HER HOUSE AND GET THE SPECIMEN.

379
00:12:39,758 --> 00:12:41,510
WE'VE BEEN LOOKING 
FOR A LITTLE EXCITEMENT.

380
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:43,053
- YEAH! IT'LL BE FUN.

381
00:12:43,053 --> 00:12:46,515
WE WILL BE 
LIKE TRACY AND HEPBURN.

382
00:12:46,515 --> 00:12:48,558
"WHAT DO YOU SAY, 
YOU OLD POOP?"

383
00:12:48,558 --> 00:12:50,435
- OH, GOD, HE'S HEPBURN.

384
00:12:50,435 --> 00:12:52,938
- I AM DONE WITH BUSTER.

385
00:12:52,938 --> 00:12:54,857
PUSHES MY BUTTONS. 
THAT'S ALL HE DOES.

386
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:57,276
- HE ALSO ZIPS YOU UP 
AND SANDS YOUR ELBOWS.

387
00:12:57,276 --> 00:12:58,819
- NOT ANYMORE. NO, NO, NO.

388
00:12:58,819 --> 00:13:00,821
HE'S PRETENDING 
HE'S GOING TO WAR.

389
00:13:00,821 --> 00:13:01,822
MR. BIG SHOT.

390
00:13:01,822 --> 00:13:03,365
GOD KNOWS WHAT 
HE'S REALLY DOING.

391
00:13:03,365 --> 00:13:04,825
- WAIT A MINUTE. 
HE SAID HE'S GOING TO WAR?

392
00:13:04,825 --> 00:13:06,326
AREN'T YOU WORRIED ABOUT THAT?

393
00:13:06,326 --> 00:13:08,120
- OH, YOU'RE SOUNDING 
LIKE YOUR UNCLE.

394
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,372
AND I'VE HAD ENOUGH 
OF HIS ATTITUDE TOO.

395
00:13:10,372 --> 00:13:13,125
-THE BOY IS GOING TO WAR. 
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO FACE THAT.

396
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:14,376
-IT'S NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS!

397
00:13:14,376 --> 00:13:17,629
- HE IS MY BOY! 
I NEED MACAROONS.

398
00:13:17,629 --> 00:13:18,713
- OH, YOU'RE HIGH!

399
00:13:18,713 --> 00:13:20,549
- OH, WELL, YOU CAN WIN 
EVERY ARGUMENT LIKE THAT,

400
00:13:20,549 --> 00:13:22,759
BUT THAT DOES NOT 
MAKE YOU RIGHT.

401
00:13:22,759 --> 00:13:24,970
- I DON'T WANT YOU TELLING HIM 
YOU'RE HIS FATHER!

402
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:26,763
I NEED ICE!

403
00:13:26,763 --> 00:13:28,933
- CAN'T YOU SEE 
YOU'RE IN DENIAL?

404
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:31,560
- YOU'RE HIGH! 
- YOU'RE DRUNK!

405
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,437
- WHERE DID BUSTER 
SAY HE WAS GOING?

406
00:13:33,437 --> 00:13:34,479
- IRAQ.

407
00:13:34,479 --> 00:13:35,564
WHICH IS A SHOT AT YOUR FATHER.

408
00:13:35,564 --> 00:13:37,316
THANK GOD 
HE'S NOT HERE TO HEAR THIS.

409
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:39,234
[howling]

410
00:13:39,234 --> 00:13:40,319
- EXCUSE ME ONE SECOND.

411
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:41,320
IT'S THE PIPES.

412
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,072
- YOU KNOW, 
MOTHER LUCILLE,

413
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:47,159
THERE'S A PSYCHOLOGICAL 
CONCEPT KNOWN AS DENIAL

414
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:49,078
THAT I BELIEVE YOU'RE EVINCING.

415
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:51,746
IT'S WHEN A THOUGHT 
IS SO HATEFUL

416
00:13:51,746 --> 00:13:54,708
THAT THE MIND 
LITERALLY REJECTS IT.

417
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:58,837
- YOU ARE A WORSE PSYCHIATRIST 
THAN YOU ARE A SON-IN-LAW,

418
00:13:58,837 --> 00:14:00,839
AND YOU WILL NEVER 
GET WORK AS AN ACTOR,

419
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:04,843
BECAUSE YOU HAVE NO TALENT.

420
00:14:04,843 --> 00:14:06,470
- WELL, IF SHE'S NOT 
GOING TO SAY ANYTHING,

421
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:08,555
I CERTAINLY CAN'T HELP HER.

422
00:14:08,555 --> 00:14:11,141
narrator: AND MAEBY 
SAW A WAY TO HELP HER COUSIN.

423
00:14:11,141 --> 00:14:12,517
- I KNOW HOW TO GET RID OF ANN.

424
00:14:12,517 --> 00:14:13,894
YOU PUT HER 
IN A ROOM WITH GANGY.

425
00:14:13,894 --> 00:14:15,312
SHE'LL CRITICIZE HER AWAY.

426
00:14:15,312 --> 00:14:17,898
- BUT WHAT WOULD GANGY 
HAVE TO CRITICIZE ABOUT ANN?

427
00:14:17,898 --> 00:14:19,399
- OH, GEORGE MICHAEL.

428
00:14:19,399 --> 00:14:22,569
narrator: IN THE ATTIC, 
MICHAEL MET WITH GEORGE SR.,

429
00:14:22,569 --> 00:14:24,029
WHO'D OVERHEARD ABOUT BUSTER.

430
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:26,531
- HE CAN'T GO. 
YOU CAN'T LET HIM.

431
00:14:26,531 --> 00:14:28,075
I COMMAND YOU.

432
00:14:28,075 --> 00:14:30,077
- I REALLY HATE IT 
WHEN YOU PUT ON THE GOD COSTUME.

433
00:14:30,077 --> 00:14:32,454
narrator: GEORGE SR. 
HAD ALWAYS WORN THE GOD COSTUME

434
00:14:32,454 --> 00:14:35,124
AT THE ANNUAL 
LIVING CLASSICS PAGEANT,

435
00:14:35,124 --> 00:14:36,166
WHERE HE AND BUSTER

436
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:40,337
RE-CREATED MICHELANGELO'S 
THE CREATION OF ADAM.

437
00:14:40,337 --> 00:14:41,671
- WHAT IF I NEVER GET A CHANCE

438
00:14:41,671 --> 00:14:44,884
TO REACH OUT AND TOUCH 
THAT HAND OF HIS AGAIN?

439
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:46,426
I GOTTA GO TO HIM.

440
00:14:46,426 --> 00:14:47,844
- POP, YOU'RE A WANTED MAN.

441
00:14:47,844 --> 00:14:49,763
YOU CANNOT RISK LEAVING 
THE ATTIC ALL THE TIME.

442
00:14:49,763 --> 00:14:50,764
- OH, WHEN?

443
00:14:50,764 --> 00:14:52,057
WHEN HAVE 
I EVER LEFT THE ATTIC?

444
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:53,850
- TWO DAYS AGO. RIGHT?

445
00:14:53,850 --> 00:14:55,352
SAW YOU FLOATING AROUND 
THE FORD DEALERSHIP.

446
00:14:55,352 --> 00:14:57,938
- YEAH, WELL, HAVE YOU SEEN 
THE NEW FORD MUSTANG?

447
00:14:57,938 --> 00:14:59,856
YOU COULD HUMP THAT HOOD.

448
00:14:59,856 --> 00:15:01,650
narrator: AND MICHAEL 
SET THE PLAN IN MOTION

449
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:03,903
TO GET MAGGIE OUT OF HER HOUSE.

450
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:05,195
-  HI, MAGGIE.

451
00:15:05,195 --> 00:15:06,363
ARE YOU BLIND AGAIN?

452
00:15:06,363 --> 00:15:07,364
- FOR THE PIZZA GUY.

453
00:15:07,364 --> 00:15:09,324
I GIVE HIM A FIVE. 
I TELL HIM TO KEEP THE CHANGE.

454
00:15:09,324 --> 00:15:10,325
WHAT ARE YOU DOIN' HERE, 
MICHAEL?

455
00:15:10,325 --> 00:15:11,576
I'M WITH A CLIENT.

456
00:15:11,576 --> 00:15:12,661
- IS THAT THE PIZZA?

457
00:15:12,661 --> 00:15:16,999
- NO! YOU'LL GET YOUR PIZZA.

458
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:18,292
SHE'S TAKING 
THE STAND TOMORROW.

459
00:15:18,292 --> 00:15:19,626
I WANT TO MAKE SURE 
IT CREAKS.

460
00:15:19,626 --> 00:15:21,753
- THERE'S SO MUCH I DON'T 
UNDERSTAND ABOUT THE LAW.

461
00:15:21,753 --> 00:15:23,338
LOOK, MAGGIE,

462
00:15:23,338 --> 00:15:26,341
IF THIS CHILD IS MINE, 
I REALLY NEED TO KNOW.

463
00:15:26,341 --> 00:15:27,927
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK? 
CAN YOU SPARE A FEW MINUTES

464
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:30,595
FOR SOMEONE WHO MIGHT BE 
THE FATHER OF YOUR BABY?

465
00:15:30,595 --> 00:15:32,306
- OF COURSE I CAN.

466
00:15:32,306 --> 00:15:33,432
- OKAY.

467
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:35,350
- BUT IT'S NOT YOU.

468
00:15:35,350 --> 00:15:39,396
[knocks at door]

469
00:15:39,396 --> 00:15:41,481
OH, FOR GOD'S SAKES.

470
00:15:41,481 --> 00:15:44,401
- OH, COME ON!

471
00:15:44,401 --> 00:15:45,402
- [scoffs] 
FINE.

472
00:15:45,402 --> 00:15:46,946
LET ME GET 
MISS FAT ASS OUTTA HERE,

473
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:47,947
AND I'LL MEET YOU 
IN THE CAR.

474
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:49,073
- OKAY.

475
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:50,074
narrator: MEANWHILE,

476
00:15:50,074 --> 00:15:51,575
ON THE OTHER SIDE 
OF MAGGIE'S HOUSE,

477
00:15:51,575 --> 00:15:55,370
LINDSAY AND TOBIAS WERE 
PUTTING THEIR PLAN INTO ACTION.

478
00:15:55,370 --> 00:15:56,746
- I'M CLOAKING MYSELF 
IN HER SCENT.

479
00:15:56,746 --> 00:15:58,999
- OH! SHE'S NOT BLIND.

480
00:15:58,999 --> 00:16:00,960
- WELL, SHE WAS 
WHEN SHE BOUGHT THIS.

481
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,294
- [laughs] 
[footsteps approaching]

482
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:03,295
OH, MY GOD! THAT'S HER!

483
00:16:03,295 --> 00:16:06,173
- QUICK! GET IN THE TUB! 
GET IN THE TUB!

484
00:16:06,173 --> 00:16:07,424
narrator: 
BUSTER, MEANWHILE,

485
00:16:07,424 --> 00:16:09,718
RECEIVED AN UNEXPECTED VISITOR.

486
00:16:09,718 --> 00:16:13,055
- I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT 
IT'S OKAY FOR YOU TO HIDE.

487
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:16,933
A MAN CAN HIDE. 
THERE'S A QUIET COURAGE IN THAT.

488
00:16:16,933 --> 00:16:18,685
- YOU'RE A GOOD UNCLE.

489
00:16:18,685 --> 00:16:22,106
- I'M NOT YOUR UNCLE. 
I'M YOUR FATHER.

490
00:16:22,106 --> 00:16:23,315
- WHAT? 
- SHH. SHH.

491
00:16:23,315 --> 00:16:24,316
QUIET COURAGE.

492
00:16:24,316 --> 00:16:26,943
QUIET COURAGE. 
HIDE.

493
00:16:26,943 --> 00:16:29,321
narrator: 
BUT BUSTER WAS CONFUSED.

494
00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:32,157
- YOU LIED TO ME. 
UNCLE OSCAR'S MY FATHER.

495
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:33,158
HE JUST TOLD ME SO.

496
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:34,951
AND MAYBE YOU'RE NOT 
EVEN MY REAL MOTHER.

497
00:16:34,951 --> 00:16:36,911
FOR ALL I KNOW, LUCILLE 2 
IS MY REAL MOTHER.

498
00:16:36,911 --> 00:16:38,163
OH, GOD!

499
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:39,999
- BUSTER, YOU WERE 
NEVER SUPPOSED TO KNOW.

500
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:41,000
- OH, YEAH?

501
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,167
WELL, HERE'S 
SOMETHING YOU SHOULD KNOW.

502
00:16:42,167 --> 00:16:44,378
I'M GOING TO WAR!

503
00:16:48,382 --> 00:16:49,883
narrator: 
BUSTER HAD JUST DISCOVERED

504
00:16:49,883 --> 00:16:51,801
HE'D BEEN LIED TO 
BY HIS PARENTS.

505
00:16:51,801 --> 00:16:53,262
- I'M GOING TO WAR!

506
00:16:53,262 --> 00:16:55,472
- YOU TOLD HIM 
YOU WERE HIS FATHER!

507
00:16:55,472 --> 00:16:56,598
- I DID NO SUCH THING!

508
00:16:56,598 --> 00:16:58,850
- YOU'RE HIGH! 
- YOU'RE DRUNK!

509
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:02,187
- [gasps] 
GEORGE.

510
00:17:02,187 --> 00:17:04,773
HE MUST'VE COME HERE 
TO SAY GOOD-BYE TO BUSTER.

511
00:17:04,773 --> 00:17:06,275
narrator: 
AND THAT'S WHEN LUCILLE

512
00:17:06,275 --> 00:17:07,984
SNAPPED OUT OF HER DENIAL.

513
00:17:07,984 --> 00:17:10,487
- MY BABY'S GOING TO WAR.

514
00:17:10,487 --> 00:17:12,072
narrator: 
LINDSAY AND TOBIAS

515
00:17:12,072 --> 00:17:15,409
WERE GATHERING EVIDENCE THAT 
MAGGIE WAS TRULY PREGNANT.

516
00:17:15,409 --> 00:17:16,993
AND THEY WERE 
HAVING FUN DOING IT.

517
00:17:16,993 --> 00:17:18,537
- THAT'S THE FIRST TIME 
WE WERE IN THE SHOWER

518
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:19,829
SINCE OUR HONEYMOON.

519
00:17:19,829 --> 00:17:21,123
- AND THIS TIME, NO TEARS.

520
00:17:21,123 --> 00:17:23,792
- TOBIAS, THIS IS THE BOX THAT 
MICHAEL WAS TALKING ABOUT.

521
00:17:23,792 --> 00:17:25,001
"60 POUNDS."

522
00:17:25,001 --> 00:17:27,629
narrator: 
BUT IT DIDN'T WEIGH 60 POUNDS.

523
00:17:27,629 --> 00:17:29,089
- [scoffs]

524
00:17:29,089 --> 00:17:30,715
narrator: 
MICHAEL WAS STALLING MAGGIE,

525
00:17:30,715 --> 00:17:32,842
AND THEY WERE ALSO HAVING FUN.

526
00:17:32,842 --> 00:17:34,219
- SALLY SITWELL?

527
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:36,263
YOU KNOW, I THINK I HAD 
HER LITTLE PLAY OVEN.

528
00:17:36,263 --> 00:17:37,514
- YEAH, I KNOW.

529
00:17:37,514 --> 00:17:39,058
IT'S A FUNNY NAME. 
BUT SHE'S A DOLL.

530
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:40,934
- YEAH, I HAD ONE. 
[phone ringing]

531
00:17:40,934 --> 00:17:43,520
IF YOU PULL HER HAIR, 
SHE'D CRY OR SOMETHING.

532
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,439
- THIS ONE KINDA 
DOES THAT TOO.

533
00:17:45,439 --> 00:17:46,440
HELLO.

534
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,732
- WE GOT THE PEE, 
AND WE'RE GONNA GET IT CHECKED.

535
00:17:47,732 --> 00:17:48,942
BUT, LISTEN, 
YOU SHOULD KNOW

536
00:17:48,942 --> 00:17:51,361
THAT THAT BOX 
THAT SAYS "60 POUNDS,"

537
00:17:51,361 --> 00:17:53,905
IT'S ACTUALLY 
LIKE TWO POUNDS.

538
00:17:53,905 --> 00:17:54,948
I THINK SHE'S PREGNANT, 
MICHAEL.

539
00:17:54,948 --> 00:17:56,825
I MEAN, THERE'S 
BABY STUFF HERE AND--

540
00:17:56,825 --> 00:17:57,951
[laughs] 
TOBIAS, STOP IT.

541
00:17:57,951 --> 00:17:59,703
THAT'S FOR THE BABY. 
IT'S NOT--OH.

542
00:17:59,703 --> 00:18:01,371
WE'RE HAVING 
A REALLY GOOD TIME.

543
00:18:01,371 --> 00:18:03,707
- YEAH? 
WELL, I KIND OF AM TOO.

544
00:18:03,707 --> 00:18:05,542
- BYE.

545
00:18:05,542 --> 00:18:08,044
- SO, NO MORE LIES. 
TELL ME THE TRUTH.

546
00:18:08,044 --> 00:18:09,796
IF--IF THAT BABY IS MINE,

547
00:18:09,796 --> 00:18:13,592
MAYBE WE'RE MEANT 
TO BE TOGETHER.

548
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:17,804
- OF COURSE IT IS, 
MICHAEL.

549
00:18:17,804 --> 00:18:18,930
narrator: 
BUT THAT'S WHEN

550
00:18:18,930 --> 00:18:21,183
THE FUNKES DISCOVERED 
WHAT WAS IN THE BOX

551
00:18:21,183 --> 00:18:23,560
THAT WAS SO EASY TO LIFT.

552
00:18:26,355 --> 00:18:27,356
- THAT'S WHAT IT IS.

553
00:18:27,356 --> 00:18:29,149
- OKAY, THE BOX WAS LIGHT 'CAUSE 
IT HAD A FAKE STOMACH IN IT.

554
00:18:29,149 --> 00:18:30,734
SO IT LOOKS LIKE 
SHE'S FAKING IT.

555
00:18:30,734 --> 00:18:32,068
OH, GOD. I HOPE YOU GET THIS.

556
00:18:32,068 --> 00:18:34,070
- WAIT UP, PLEASE.

557
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:35,489
narrator: 
AND GEORGE MICHAEL AND MAEBY

558
00:18:35,489 --> 00:18:37,199
BROUGHT ANN TO THE PENTHOUSE,

559
00:18:37,199 --> 00:18:40,034
IN HOPES THAT 
LUCILLE WOULD DRIVE HER AWAY.

560
00:18:40,034 --> 00:18:41,536
- ISN'T ANN GREAT?

561
00:18:41,536 --> 00:18:42,537
- OH, SHE'S LOVELY.

562
00:18:42,537 --> 00:18:43,538
narrator: UNFORTUNATELY,

563
00:18:43,538 --> 00:18:46,458
SHE WAS DISTRACTED BY 
THE THOUGHT OF LOSING BUSTER.

564
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:48,293
- HEY, DO YOU HAVE 
ANY BREAD PUDDING?

565
00:18:48,293 --> 00:18:51,463
'CAUSE YOU'D BE SURPRISED 
HOW MUCH THIS ONE CAN PUT AWAY.

566
00:18:51,463 --> 00:18:52,464
- HA!

567
00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:54,841
- NOW THAT BUSTER'S NOT HERE, 
THERE'S NO ONE TO FINISH IT.

568
00:18:54,841 --> 00:18:58,387
I DON'T CARE 
IF I EVER EAT AGAIN.

569
00:19:04,934 --> 00:19:07,020
- YOU KNOW, 
WHEN TIMES ARE TOUGH,

570
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:10,524
YOU CAN ALWAYS TURN TO 
THE POWER OF PRAYER.

571
00:19:10,524 --> 00:19:13,235
- HERE WE GO.

572
00:19:13,235 --> 00:19:15,237
- SHOW ME. 
- [gasps]

573
00:19:15,237 --> 00:19:18,657
narrator: 
THIS WAS A BIG GET FOR GOD.

574
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:21,034
AND MICHAEL BROUGHT 
MAGGIE HOME TO MEET HIS SON.

575
00:19:21,034 --> 00:19:22,035
- THIS IS GONNA BE EASY.

576
00:19:22,035 --> 00:19:23,119
HE'S BEEN SIGNING OFF 
ON EVERYONE LATELY.

577
00:19:23,119 --> 00:19:24,120
MAYBE HE CALLED. 
[Lindsay's recorded voice]

578
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:26,540
- HEY, SO WHAT'S 
THE DEAL ON ZUCKERKORN?

579
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:29,293
'CAUSE YOU KNOW MY FAT CASE-- 
IT'S REALLY PRETTY THIN.

580
00:19:29,293 --> 00:19:32,837
- LYING, UNTRUSTWORTHY-- 
- YEAH.

581
00:19:32,837 --> 00:19:34,714
PLUS, I HEARD 
HE HANGS OUT AT REST STOPS.

582
00:19:34,714 --> 00:19:36,633
- NO, NO. 
I'M TALKIN' ABOUT YOU, MAGGIE.

583
00:19:36,633 --> 00:19:39,010
AND I DON'T KNOW WHY 
I'M SURPRISED.

584
00:19:39,010 --> 00:19:41,305
I SHOULDN'T BE. 
YOU'RE A LIAR. YOU LIE.

585
00:19:41,305 --> 00:19:42,514
WELL, I MEAN,

586
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:44,433
I HEARD HE HANGS OUT 
AT REST STOPS. OKAY--

587
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:46,185
- AND I KEEP BUYING IT TOO.

588
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:48,102
AND SO MAYBE THERE IS 
SOMETHING WRONG WITH ME.

589
00:19:48,102 --> 00:19:50,063
I REALLY THOUGHT WE WERE 
STARTIN' TO TRUST EACH OTHER.

590
00:19:50,063 --> 00:19:51,273
AND I JUST GOT 
A MESSAGE FROM MY SISTER

591
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:53,149
SAYING THERE'S A BOX AT YOUR 
HOUSE WITH A FAT SUIT IN IT.

592
00:19:53,149 --> 00:19:54,150
WHAT'VE YOU GOT?

593
00:19:54,150 --> 00:19:55,735
LIKE A DIFFERENT 
ONE FOR EACH TRIMESTER?

594
00:19:55,735 --> 00:19:58,863
- YOU HAD YOUR SISTER 
BREAK INTO MY HOUSE?

595
00:19:58,863 --> 00:20:00,073
- WHICH ONE ARE YOU 
WEARIN' RIGHT NOW?

596
00:20:00,073 --> 00:20:02,033
IS THIS 
THE READY-TO-BURST MODEL?

597
00:20:02,033 --> 00:20:05,204
NOW, THERE'S ZERO TRUST HERE. 
GOOD-BYE.

598
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:08,373
IT'S BEEN FUN...

599
00:20:08,373 --> 00:20:09,458
NOT.

600
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:10,459
narrator: 
MICHAEL HAD HOPED SOMETHING

601
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:13,002
MORE DRAMATIC WOULD HAVE 
COME OUT OF HIS MOUTH.

602
00:20:13,002 --> 00:20:14,379
OR AT LEAST MORE CURRENT.

603
00:20:14,379 --> 00:20:17,882
- OH, YOU'RE SO RIGHT, MICHAEL. 
I REALLY CAN'T BE TRUSTED.

604
00:20:17,882 --> 00:20:22,178
'CAUSE I'M FAKIN' IT...

605
00:20:22,178 --> 00:20:24,389
NOT.

606
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:27,392
- HELLO, MICHAEL.

607
00:20:27,392 --> 00:20:30,144
WELL, MY WIFE AND I 
FINALLY HAD THE THRILL

608
00:20:30,144 --> 00:20:33,690
OF SEEING A PLUS SIGN 
ON A PREGNANCY TEST.

609
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:37,527
- YOU'RE GONNA BE A DADDY!

610
00:20:37,527 --> 00:20:40,196
narrator: ON THE NEXT 
ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT.

611
00:20:40,196 --> 00:20:42,532
BARRY GETS A BIG BREAK 
ON HIS CASE.

612
00:20:42,532 --> 00:20:44,284
- THE FAT GIRL 
IN MY SKIP CHURCH'S CASE?

613
00:20:44,284 --> 00:20:45,285
NOT FAT.

614
00:20:45,285 --> 00:20:46,453
THE ATTORNEY BOUGHT 
HER A FAT SUIT.

615
00:20:46,453 --> 00:20:48,413
OH! I'VE GOT ANOTHER CASE.

616
00:20:48,413 --> 00:20:50,164
MAGGIE IS SUING YOU 
FOR PATERNITY.

617
00:20:50,164 --> 00:20:51,458
narrator: 
AND FOR THE FIRST TIME,

618
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:52,667
LUCILLE PRAYS.

619
00:20:52,667 --> 00:20:54,168
- TAKE SOMETHING ELSE FROM US.

620
00:20:54,168 --> 00:20:55,670
DO WHATEVER YOU HAVE TO

621
00:20:55,670 --> 00:20:57,631
TO KEEP MY BOY 
FROM GOING TO WAR.

622
00:20:57,631 --> 00:20:59,674
narrator: 
AND BUSTER IS ON HIS WAY...

623
00:20:59,674 --> 00:21:03,470
WHEN HE DECIDES TO PURSUE 
A LONG-DELAYED RITE OF PASSAGE.

624
00:21:04,929 --> 00:21:07,849
- LOOSE SEAL! 
WATCH OUT FOR LOOSE SEAL!

625
00:21:07,849 --> 00:21:09,893
- I DON'T CARE ABOUT LUCILLE!

626
00:21:09,893 --> 00:21:11,270
SHE LIES!

627
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:14,273
narrator: AND THEN 
A SEAL BITES OFF HIS HAND.

628
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:15,315
- AAAA!

629
00:21:15,315 --> 00:21:16,566
- ...MEN.
