00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:02,402
[narrator] 
NOW THE STORY

2
00:00:02,402 --> 00:00:04,124
OF A WEALTHY FAMILY 
WHO LOST EVERYTHING...

3
00:00:04,124 --> 00:00:05,565
AND THE ONE SON 
WHO HAD NO CHOICE...

4
00:00:05,565 --> 00:00:07,207
BUT TO KEEP THEM ALL TOGETHER.

5
00:00:12,732 --> 00:00:14,894
IT'S ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT.

6
00:00:18,938 --> 00:00:20,740
[narrator] 
MICHAEL BLUTH AND HIS FAMILY HAD

7
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:22,021
GATHERED AT THE COURTHOUSE...

8
00:00:22,021 --> 00:00:25,905
TO DISCUSS GEORGE SR.'S 
UPCOMING TRIAL.

9
00:00:25,905 --> 00:00:28,108
- DO NOT ASK ME HOW I DID IT--

10
00:00:28,108 --> 00:00:30,630
THEY OFFERED US A PLEA BARGAIN.

11
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:33,513
- REALLY? THERE'S A CHANCE 
WE DON'T HAVE TO GO TO TRIAL?

12
00:00:33,513 --> 00:00:35,235
- ABSOLUTELY, 
AND I SAY WE TAKE IT,

13
00:00:35,235 --> 00:00:37,357
BECAUSE WE WILL NEVER GET 
AN OFFER THIS GOOD AGAIN.

14
00:00:37,357 --> 00:00:40,320
- WOW. 
- GREAT. WHAT'S THE OFFER?

15
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,523
- WELL, I DIDN'T READ IT. 
I JUST GOT IT YESTERDAY.

16
00:00:43,523 --> 00:00:45,044
F.Y.I.,

17
00:00:45,044 --> 00:00:46,846
I'M TRYING TO GET BACK 
INTO THE DATING WORLD.

18
00:00:52,051 --> 00:00:54,654
HEY, YOU'RE NOT ONE OF THOSE 
SILLY MEN THAT'S DRESSED LIKE

19
00:00:54,654 --> 00:00:55,935
A WOMAN, ARE YOU?

20
00:00:55,935 --> 00:00:58,178
- NO, BABY. 
I'M THE REAL THING.

21
00:00:59,779 --> 00:01:01,901
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW 
A PERSON CAN PUT THEIR SEX LIFE

22
00:01:01,901 --> 00:01:03,383
IN FRONT OF THEIR WORK.

23
00:01:03,383 --> 00:01:06,186
- HE'S A MAN, MICHAEL. 
HE NEEDS A WOMAN.

24
00:01:06,186 --> 00:01:08,948
- CAN WE GET BACK TO WORK, 
FOLKS?

25
00:01:08,948 --> 00:01:11,030
WE'VE ONLY GOT 24 HOURS 
TO RESPOND,

26
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:12,312
AND NO MATTER WHAT THIS IS,

27
00:01:12,312 --> 00:01:14,074
IT IS BETTER THAN GOING 
TO TRIAL.

28
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:17,197
- YOUR FATHER'S NOT HERE. 
I'LL SPEAK FOR HIM.

29
00:01:17,197 --> 00:01:19,559
HE LOVES IT. 
HE'S CRAZY ABOUT THE PLEA.

30
00:01:19,559 --> 00:01:21,241
HE'S DYING TO 
GET OUT OF THAT PRISON

31
00:01:21,241 --> 00:01:22,762
AND BE WITH A WOMAN AGAIN.

32
00:01:22,762 --> 00:01:24,124
[narrator] 
IN FACT, GEORGE SR.

33
00:01:24,124 --> 00:01:25,165
HAD A WOMAN IN HIS LIFE--

34
00:01:25,165 --> 00:01:26,566
CINDI LIGHTBALLOON,

35
00:01:26,566 --> 00:01:28,448
A FAN OF HIS CAGED WISDOM 
VIDEO SERIES,

36
00:01:28,448 --> 00:01:31,171
WITH WHOM HE'D HAD 
FLEETING PHYSICAL CONTACT.

37
00:01:31,171 --> 00:01:32,492
THAT MORNING HOWEVER,

38
00:01:32,492 --> 00:01:34,494
SHE HAD SOME STARTLING NEWS 
FOR HIM.

39
00:01:34,494 --> 00:01:36,616
- I'M A MOLE.

40
00:01:36,616 --> 00:01:40,340
- WELL, YOU KNOW, GOD DOESN'T 
CARE HOW BIG YOUR TEETH ARE.

41
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:42,582
YES, YOU COULD GO TO A DENTIST. 
YOU COULD-- WHOO.

42
00:01:42,582 --> 00:01:45,785
YOU COULD GRIND OFF ABOUT-- 
I DON'T KNOW-- 30%, MAYBE MORE.

43
00:01:45,785 --> 00:01:47,627
YEAH, I WOULDN'T MISS IT.

44
00:01:47,627 --> 00:01:48,988
- NO, NO, NO. I MEAN,

45
00:01:48,988 --> 00:01:51,191
I'M AN UNDERCOVER 
GOVERNMENT AGENT.

46
00:01:51,191 --> 00:01:53,713
I WAS SENT HERE 
TO INVESTIGATE YOU.

47
00:01:53,713 --> 00:01:55,034
UP UNTIL LAST WEEK,

48
00:01:55,034 --> 00:01:57,437
MY BEING IN LOVE WITH YOU 
WAS JUST AN ACT.

49
00:01:57,437 --> 00:01:58,638
- HMM.

50
00:01:58,638 --> 00:02:00,520
- BUT NOW I WANT TO 
BE WITH YOU.

51
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:02,122
AND I KNOW 
YOU CAN BEAT THIS CASE

52
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:03,603
THEY HAVE AGAINST YOU.

53
00:02:03,603 --> 00:02:05,405
I KNOW THIS FOR A FACT.

54
00:02:07,086 --> 00:02:08,528
- I WANT TO FIGHT THIS THING.

55
00:02:08,528 --> 00:02:10,410
I CAN BEAT IT. 
I KNOW IT FOR A FACT.

56
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:11,451
- WE'RE TAKING THE PLEA.

57
00:02:11,451 --> 00:02:12,892
- LUCILLE, 
WE'RE NOT TAKING A PLEA.

58
00:02:12,892 --> 00:02:14,534
- WE DON'T EVEN KNOW 
WHAT THE PLEA IS YET.

59
00:02:14,534 --> 00:02:15,975
- IS THAT A SHOT AT ME?

60
00:02:15,975 --> 00:02:17,857
'CAUSE THAT MAKES ME 
WANT TO READ IT ALL THE LESS.

61
00:02:17,857 --> 00:02:19,579
- YOU HAVE ANOTHER ONE OF THESE? 
- YES, I DO.

62
00:02:19,579 --> 00:02:21,461
- WE'LL BOTH READ IT. 
- YOU'RE GOING TO READ THAT?

63
00:02:21,461 --> 00:02:22,862
- YEAH. 
- IT'S PRETTY THICK.

64
00:02:22,862 --> 00:02:24,624
- HE THINKS HE'S A LAWYER 
'CAUSE HE PLAYED ONE

65
00:02:24,624 --> 00:02:26,186
IN 10th GRADE.

66
00:02:26,186 --> 00:02:27,427
[narrator] 
IN ORDER TO SATISFY

67
00:02:27,427 --> 00:02:28,828
AN ENGLISH REQUIREMENT,

68
00:02:28,828 --> 00:02:30,910
MICHAEL APPEARED IN 
THE DRAMA CLUB'S PRODUCTION...

69
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:32,712
OF AN ORIGINAL PLAY, 
THE TRIAL OF CAPTAIN HOOK.

70
00:02:32,712 --> 00:02:36,396
- [singing] 
YOU'RE A CROOK, CAPTAIN HOOK

71
00:02:36,396 --> 00:02:40,079
JUDGE, WON'T YOU THROW 
THE BOOK AT THE PIRATE--

72
00:02:40,079 --> 00:02:43,443
- I DON'T REMEMBER THAT. 
- WELL, YOU LEFT DURING MY SOLO.

73
00:02:43,443 --> 00:02:45,485
AND I'M SURPRISED MY TWIN SISTER 
CAN REMEMBER THAT,

74
00:02:45,485 --> 00:02:48,528
CONSIDERING SHE WAS REPEATING 
THE NINTH GRADE AT THE TIME.

75
00:02:48,528 --> 00:02:51,491
- I DON'T REMEMBER THAT. 
- BIG SURPRISE, MOM.

76
00:02:51,491 --> 00:02:53,012
IT'S NOT LIKE YOU 
EVER TOOK AN INTEREST

77
00:02:53,012 --> 00:02:54,294
IN OUR LIVES.

78
00:02:54,294 --> 00:02:56,256
HONESTLY, IF I EVER DID 
TO MAEBY WHAT YOU-

79
00:02:56,256 --> 00:02:57,537
[narrator] 
LINDSAY RECALLED

80
00:02:57,537 --> 00:02:58,738
THAT EARLIER THAT DAY...

81
00:02:58,738 --> 00:03:01,060
SHE HAD RECEIVED A LETTER 
FROM THE HIGH SCHOOL

82
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:03,062
ABOUT HER OWN DAUGHTER.

83
00:03:05,345 --> 00:03:06,946
AND SO LATER, 
LINDSAY AND TOBIAS

84
00:03:06,946 --> 00:03:10,029
TRIED A MORE HANDS-ON APPROACH 
TO PARENTING.

85
00:03:10,029 --> 00:03:12,472
- WE WOULD LIKE YOU TO TUTOR 
OUR DAUGHTER.

86
00:03:12,472 --> 00:03:13,953
- NOW, OF COURSE,

87
00:03:13,953 --> 00:03:15,955
WE'RE HAVING A BIT 
OF A CASH-FLOW PROBLEM,

88
00:03:15,955 --> 00:03:17,917
BUT I ASSURE YOU,

89
00:03:17,917 --> 00:03:19,879
IF YOU BRING OUR 
LITTLE GIRL'S GRADES UP,

90
00:03:19,879 --> 00:03:21,761
I WILL PACK 
YOUR SWEET PINK MOUTH

91
00:03:21,761 --> 00:03:23,563
WITH SO MUCH ICE CREAM,

92
00:03:23,563 --> 00:03:25,164
YOU'LL BE THE ENVY 
OF EVERY JERRY AND JANE

93
00:03:25,164 --> 00:03:26,566
ON THE BLOCK.

94
00:03:26,566 --> 00:03:28,768
- WE'RE THE ONLY HOUSE 
ON THE BLOCK.

95
00:03:31,611 --> 00:03:33,533
- PERHAPS WE SHOULD 
GET SOMEBODY ELSE.

96
00:03:33,533 --> 00:03:35,415
[narrator] 
MICHAEL, MEANWHILE, HAD GONE

97
00:03:35,415 --> 00:03:37,617
TO THE BAR ACROSS THE STREET 
FROM THE COURTHOUSE...

98
00:03:37,617 --> 00:03:39,299
TO READ THE PLEA OFFER.

99
00:03:39,299 --> 00:03:41,701
- "NOT TO EXCEED FIVE YEARS, 
BUT NO LESS THAN THREE."

100
00:03:41,701 --> 00:03:43,503
- SO WHAT DO YOU THINK? 
- I DON'T KNOW.

101
00:03:43,503 --> 00:03:45,465
I'M SO MAD AT BARRY 
I CAN'T EVEN FOCUS.

102
00:03:45,465 --> 00:03:46,946
THAT GUY'S OUT DATING?

103
00:03:46,946 --> 00:03:48,468
I MEAN, I'D LOVE TO BE DATING, 
BUT I--

104
00:03:48,468 --> 00:03:50,109
- CAN'T RELAX?

105
00:03:50,109 --> 00:03:51,831
- NO. I DON'T HAVE TIME 
FOR A RELATIONSHIP.

106
00:03:51,831 --> 00:03:53,473
THIS IS IMPORTANT.

107
00:03:53,473 --> 00:03:55,635
- NO ONE SAID ANYTHING 
ABOUT A RELATIONSHIP, MICHAEL.

108
00:03:55,635 --> 00:03:58,037
IF YOU'D SLEPT WITH MORE THAN 
FOUR WOMEN, YOU'D KNOW THAT.

109
00:03:58,037 --> 00:04:00,720
- I HAVE, GOB. 
- MORE THAN FIVE?

110
00:04:02,282 --> 00:04:03,603
LET'S SAY "FIVE".

111
00:04:03,603 --> 00:04:06,085
THIS IS A COURTHOUSE BAR, 
MICHAEL.

112
00:04:06,085 --> 00:04:08,207
THESE ARE PROFESSIONAL, 
AGGRESSIVE WOMEN...

113
00:04:08,207 --> 00:04:10,890
WHO ARE LOOKING FOR NOTHING MORE 
THAN A ONE-NIGHT STAND.

114
00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:14,694
NO REAL NAMES, 
NO PROMISES.

115
00:04:14,694 --> 00:04:16,416
- I'M NOT A ONE-NIGHT STAND 
KIND OF GUY.

116
00:04:16,416 --> 00:04:17,977
I DON'T LIKE 
LYING TO WOMEN.

117
00:04:17,977 --> 00:04:20,620
- THESE ARE LAWYERS-- 
THAT'S LATIN FOR "LIAR."

118
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:22,742
- I CAN'T BELIEVE I'M STILL 
READING THE SAME SENTENCE.

119
00:04:22,742 --> 00:04:24,143
HOW CAN SOMETHING BE

120
00:04:24,143 --> 00:04:25,745
"NO LESS THAN THREE" 
IF IT EXCEEDS SIX?

121
00:04:25,745 --> 00:04:27,467
I MEAN, SIX IS STILL 
MORE THAN THREE, RIGHT?

122
00:04:27,467 --> 00:04:30,029
- YEAH, AND IT'S STILL 
MORE THAN FIVE.

123
00:04:31,431 --> 00:04:35,154
- OH! OH. OH, I'M SORRY. 
IT'S OKAY.

124
00:04:35,154 --> 00:04:36,676
I'M FALLING ALL OVER YOU. 
[chuckles]

125
00:04:36,676 --> 00:04:37,917
- LET ME MOVE DOWN.

126
00:04:37,917 --> 00:04:39,719
I'M JUST WORKING 
ON THIS PLEA.

127
00:04:39,719 --> 00:04:42,241
- IF YOU'RE PLEADING WITH ME 
TO HAVE A DRINK WITH YOU,

128
00:04:42,241 --> 00:04:43,683
YOU CAN STOP BEGGING.

129
00:04:43,683 --> 00:04:46,526
- [chuckles] 
NO, NO. IT'S A--

130
00:04:46,526 --> 00:04:48,207
IT'S A PLEA 
FOR THIS CASE THAT I'M--

131
00:04:48,207 --> 00:04:49,729
I'M SORRY--- YOU WANT A DRINK.

132
00:04:49,729 --> 00:04:53,012
- WELL, I DIDN'T COME HERE 
FOR THE VIEW.

133
00:04:53,012 --> 00:04:54,454
I'LL HAVE 
A VODKA MARTINI.

134
00:04:54,454 --> 00:04:56,175
- I'LL TELL HIM.

135
00:04:56,175 --> 00:04:59,018
- SO, ANOTHER LAWYER, HUH? 
- VODKA MARTINI!

136
00:04:59,018 --> 00:05:02,302
- I'M MAGGIE LIZER, 
AS IN "MAGGIE LIES HER ASS OFF."

137
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:06,105
[laughing]

138
00:05:06,105 --> 00:05:07,907
ONE PERSON LAUGHED AT THAT ONCE,

139
00:05:07,907 --> 00:05:09,829
AND I DON'T KNOW 
WHY I KEEP TRYING IT.

140
00:05:09,829 --> 00:05:11,070
- NO, IT'S GOOD. YEAH.

141
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:12,832
- WHAT KIND OF LAW 
DO YOU PRACTICE?

142
00:05:12,832 --> 00:05:16,636
- [young Michael singing] 
YOU'RE A CROOK, CAPTAIN HOOK

143
00:05:16,636 --> 00:05:20,239
- MARITIME. MARITIME LAW. 
LAWYERS OF THE SEA.

144
00:05:20,239 --> 00:05:22,682
- OH. 
SUBMARINE CHASER.

145
00:05:22,682 --> 00:05:25,044
[giggles] 
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

146
00:05:25,044 --> 00:05:27,086
- CHARETH. 
- CHARETH.

147
00:05:27,086 --> 00:05:29,048
OH. SO THEN 
WHAT'S YOUR LAST NAME?

148
00:05:29,048 --> 00:05:31,571
- CUTE STORY-- 
- CUTESTORY?

149
00:05:33,052 --> 00:05:35,174
- YES. 
CHARETH CUTESTORY.

150
00:05:35,174 --> 00:05:37,056
- THAT'S 
AN INTERESTING NAME.

151
00:05:37,056 --> 00:05:38,778
- IS IT?

152
00:05:38,778 --> 00:05:41,901
- SO HERE'S THE TEST 
THAT I FAILED.

153
00:05:41,901 --> 00:05:44,664
- OH, OKAY. YEAH, I SEE 
THE PROBLEM RIGHT AWAY.

154
00:05:44,664 --> 00:05:46,666
YOU, UH-- YOU GOT 
ALL THE ANSWERS WRONG.

155
00:05:46,666 --> 00:05:49,028
YOU KNOW YOU, YOU EVEN 
GOT YOUR NAME WRONG HERE.

156
00:05:49,028 --> 00:05:50,590
IT SAYS, "S. FUNKE.

157
00:05:50,590 --> 00:05:52,552
- YEAH, WELL, SEE, 
WHAT THEY WANT YOU TO DO...

158
00:05:52,552 --> 00:05:54,874
IS PUT AN "S" IF YOU'RE SINGLE, 
AN "M" IF YOU'RE MARRIED.

159
00:05:54,874 --> 00:05:56,716
I MEAN, MOST OF US 
ARE ALL SINGLE, BUT IT'S

160
00:05:56,716 --> 00:05:58,598
A WHOLE GOVERNMENT THING, SO--

161
00:05:58,598 --> 00:06:00,720
- YEAH. OKAY. THE FIRST THING 
YOU WANT TO DO WHEN YOU'RE

162
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,841
DEALING WITH FRACTIONS--

163
00:06:01,841 --> 00:06:04,083
- YEAH. 
SO I'M GONNA GO, OKAY?

164
00:06:04,083 --> 00:06:06,165
SO JUST FILL IN 
ALL THE RIGHT ANSWERS HERE,

165
00:06:06,165 --> 00:06:08,247
AND I'LL SEE WHERE I WENT WRONG.

166
00:06:08,247 --> 00:06:10,289
AND YOU'RE GETTING 
PAID FOR THIS RIGHT?

167
00:06:10,289 --> 00:06:13,252
- THERE WAS TALK OF ICE CREAM, 
BUT NOT EXACTLY ON MY TERMS.

168
00:06:13,252 --> 00:06:16,135
WOW! WHERE DID YOU GET ALL THAT? 
DO YOU HAVE A JOB OR SOMETHING?

169
00:06:16,135 --> 00:06:19,218
- NO, BUT YOU DO.

170
00:06:19,218 --> 00:06:21,541
NOW, LOOK. 
DON'T FEEL GUILTY.

171
00:06:21,541 --> 00:06:24,023
I DON'T REALLY NEED TUTORING 
ANYWAYS, OKAY?

172
00:06:24,023 --> 00:06:25,384
ENJOY THE 200 BUCKS.

173
00:06:25,384 --> 00:06:27,306
- OH, THERE-- 
THERE'S SIX 20s HERE.

174
00:06:27,306 --> 00:06:30,630
- THAT'S RIGHT. 
- RIGHT.

175
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:32,592
[narrator] 
AFTER AN EVENING OF DRINKING,

176
00:06:32,592 --> 00:06:33,953
MICHAEL, BEING THE SENSIBLE ONE,

177
00:06:33,953 --> 00:06:35,995
OFFERED TO GIVE MAGGIE 
A RIDE HOME.

178
00:06:35,995 --> 00:06:39,078
- OH-HO! 
[giggling]

179
00:06:43,683 --> 00:06:45,084
[narrator] 
THE NEXT MORNING,

180
00:06:45,084 --> 00:06:46,405
MICHAEL WAS WONDERING...

181
00:06:46,405 --> 00:06:48,207
HOW TO END 
HIS FIRST ONE-NIGHT STAND.

182
00:06:49,168 --> 00:06:50,690
- COFFEE?

183
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:52,732
- HI. YES, PLEASE. 
THANK YOU. THAT'S GREAT.

184
00:06:52,732 --> 00:06:54,293
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?

185
00:06:54,293 --> 00:06:56,456
I AM GOING TO HAVE TO 
READ THAT PLEA SOON, OKAY?

186
00:06:56,456 --> 00:06:58,137
'CAUSE IT'S A BIG CASE.

187
00:06:58,137 --> 00:06:59,859
BUT I PROMISE LATER 
I WILL CALL--

188
00:06:59,859 --> 00:07:01,461
[narrator] 
MICHAEL STRUGGLED

189
00:07:01,461 --> 00:07:02,702
TO FOLLOW GOB'S INSTRUCTION

190
00:07:02,702 --> 00:07:04,423
TO JUST WALK AWAY.

191
00:07:04,423 --> 00:07:06,626
- I'LL-- I'LL-- I'LL CALL, OKAY? 
ALL RIGHT?

192
00:07:06,626 --> 00:07:09,228
HEY. WHO'S THIS? 
- OH, THAT'S JUSTICE.

193
00:07:09,228 --> 00:07:10,910
- HI, JUSTICE.

194
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:13,793
- HI, JUSTICE. 
IS HE AS HANDSOME AS HE SMELLS?

195
00:07:13,793 --> 00:07:16,315
- I DIDN'T-- I DIDN'T KNOW 
THAT YOU HAD A DOG.

196
00:07:16,315 --> 00:07:18,237
- HOW ELSE 
AM I GONNA GET TO WORK?

197
00:07:18,237 --> 00:07:19,999
- YOU RIDE A DOG TO WORK?

198
00:07:19,999 --> 00:07:21,681
- [chuckles] 
YOU ARE FUNNY.

199
00:07:21,681 --> 00:07:24,283
LET ME SEE THAT SMILE.

200
00:07:24,283 --> 00:07:26,726
- WELL, IT'S TOUGH 
WITH YOUR HANDS IN THE WAY.

201
00:07:26,726 --> 00:07:28,007
- [laughing]

202
00:07:28,007 --> 00:07:30,530
SAY WHEN. 
- OKAY.

203
00:07:32,852 --> 00:07:34,373
[narrator] 
AND SUDDENLY, MICHAEL

204
00:07:34,373 --> 00:07:35,615
RECALLED SOME NON SEQUITURS

205
00:07:35,615 --> 00:07:37,056
FROM THE NIGHT BEFORE.

206
00:07:37,056 --> 00:07:39,418
- SO, TELL ME SOMETHING PERSONAL 
ABOUT YOURSELF.

207
00:07:39,418 --> 00:07:41,380
- UH, WELL, I HAVE 
AN IRREVERSIBLE CASE

208
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:43,703
OF OCULAR RETINOBLASTOMA.

209
00:07:43,703 --> 00:07:46,025
- HEY. I THOUGHT WE SAID 
NO MORE LAW TALK.

210
00:07:46,025 --> 00:07:48,107
I REALLY CAN'T SEE 
ANYBODY RIGHT NOW.

211
00:07:48,107 --> 00:07:50,870
- OH, WELL, 
I CAN'T SEE ANYBODY EVER.

212
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:54,874
I'M BLIND. 
- I'M WASTED.

213
00:07:54,874 --> 00:07:56,796
[narrator] 
MICHAEL REALIZED

214
00:07:56,796 --> 00:07:59,519
THAT THE WOMAN HE WAS ATTEMPTG 
TO NEVER SEE AGAIN WAS BLIND,

215
00:07:59,519 --> 00:08:01,681
AND HE WAS OVERCOME WITH GUILT.

216
00:08:01,681 --> 00:08:04,363
- WHEN... CAN WE GO OUT AGAIN? 
- REALLY?

217
00:08:04,363 --> 00:08:06,646
I THOUGHT YOU WERE, LIKE, 
JUST INTO THIS ONE-NIGHT STAND

218
00:08:06,646 --> 00:08:07,967
KIND OF THING.

219
00:08:07,967 --> 00:08:09,448
COME ON. 
I TOOK A BLIND WOMAN HOME

220
00:08:09,448 --> 00:08:11,170
WITH NO INTENTION 
OF DATING HER AGAIN?

221
00:08:11,170 --> 00:08:13,292
PLEASE! 
- [guffaws]

222
00:08:18,297 --> 00:08:20,179
[narrator] 
GEORGE SR. WAS CONTINUING

223
00:08:20,179 --> 00:08:22,301
TO EXPLOIT HIS RELATIONSHIP 
WITH CINDI.

224
00:08:22,301 --> 00:08:25,945
- WHAT-- WHAT EVIDENCE 
DOES THE GOVERNMENT HAVE...

225
00:08:25,945 --> 00:08:28,227
ON OLD WISE GEORGE, 
BY THE WAY?

226
00:08:28,227 --> 00:08:29,909
- OH, I HATE IT 
WHEN YOU CALL YOURSELF OLD!

227
00:08:29,909 --> 00:08:31,350
- [laughs]

228
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:34,273
- YOU'RE NEW TO ME! 
- OH, THAT'S-- THAT'S NICE.

229
00:08:34,273 --> 00:08:37,837
DO THEY HAVE A-- A FILE 
OR TAPES?

230
00:08:37,837 --> 00:08:40,279
- OH, WHAT'S THE USE? 
YOU'RE MARRIED.

231
00:08:40,279 --> 00:08:42,241
- YEAH. LET ME ASK YOU-- 
- WE'LL NEVER BE TOGETHER.

232
00:08:42,241 --> 00:08:43,683
- LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION.

233
00:08:43,683 --> 00:08:45,164
- LET'S JUST GO BACK 
TO WHAT WE DO BEST.

234
00:08:45,164 --> 00:08:47,567
- OKAY. 
- TWEAK ME.

235
00:08:47,567 --> 00:08:50,089
- GEORGE! 
- LUCILLE!

236
00:08:50,089 --> 00:08:51,651
HI. UH, THIS IS NOT 
WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE.

237
00:08:51,651 --> 00:08:53,372
- IT LOOKS LIKE 
YOU'RE TWEAKING HER NIPPLES

238
00:08:53,372 --> 00:08:55,134
THROUGH A CHAIN-LINK FENCE.

239
00:08:55,134 --> 00:08:56,656
- YEP. YEAH, THAT'S IT.

240
00:08:56,656 --> 00:08:58,978
- IS THIS WHY YOU WANTED TO 
FIGHT THIS THING?

241
00:08:58,978 --> 00:09:00,940
SO YOU COULD RUN OFF 
WITH THIS GREAT REDWOOD

242
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:02,542
OF A WHORE?

243
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:05,184
- LISTEN TO ME. 
SHE IS A FAN OF MINE.

244
00:09:05,184 --> 00:09:07,066
SHE HAS SEEN EVERYTHING 
I'VE DONE.

245
00:09:07,066 --> 00:09:09,468
YOU UNDERSTAND? 
EVERYTHING.

246
00:09:09,468 --> 00:09:11,631
- WELL, SO HAVE I,

247
00:09:11,631 --> 00:09:13,673
AND I'M NOT GOING TO 
PUT UP WITH IT ANYMORE.

248
00:09:13,673 --> 00:09:14,994
- OKAY.

249
00:09:14,994 --> 00:09:16,355
- YOU'LL BE HEARING 
FROM BARRY.

250
00:09:16,355 --> 00:09:19,959
- ALL RIGHT. HON? 
HONEY? HON?

251
00:09:19,959 --> 00:09:21,160
- OH, GOD. 
I'M A HOME-WRECKER.

252
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,401
- OH, NO.

253
00:09:22,401 --> 00:09:23,763
- I NEVER WANTED 
TO BE THAT PERSON.

254
00:09:23,763 --> 00:09:25,204
- NO, NO.

255
00:09:25,204 --> 00:09:27,206
NO. NO, CINDI, IT'S-- 
CINDI?

256
00:09:27,206 --> 00:09:29,689
[narrator] 
MICHAEL CAME HOME UPSET THAT

257
00:09:29,689 --> 00:09:31,771
HIS ONE-NIGHT STAND WASN'T OVER.

258
00:09:31,771 --> 00:09:33,733
- YOU SHOULD HAVE 
STAYED WITH ME LAST NIGHT.

259
00:09:33,733 --> 00:09:36,415
YOU COULD HAVE SEEN ME 
GET SOME MAJOR ACTION

260
00:09:36,415 --> 00:09:38,297
FROM A MAJOR BLONDE...

261
00:09:38,297 --> 00:09:39,899
WHO JUST MAJORED 
IN MARINE BIOLOGY,

262
00:09:39,899 --> 00:09:41,380
IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

263
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:42,622
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN.

264
00:09:42,622 --> 00:09:44,103
I CAN'T IMAGINE 
WHAT THAT MEANS.

265
00:09:44,103 --> 00:09:46,185
I ACTUALLY HAD A PRETTY 
INTERESTING NIGHT MYSELF.

266
00:09:46,185 --> 00:09:48,347
- REALLY? 
WHAT'D YOU DO, READ THE PLEA?

267
00:09:48,347 --> 00:09:50,710
- NO, I DIDN'T HAVE A CHANCE TO. 
I WENT HOME WITH SOMEONE.

268
00:09:50,710 --> 00:09:53,953
- WHAT'S WRONG WITH HER? 
- NOTHING'S WRONG WITH HER.

269
00:09:56,716 --> 00:09:59,558
SHE'S BLIND. 
- ARE YOU SERIOUS?

270
00:09:59,558 --> 00:10:01,400
- I DIDN'T KNOW AT THE TIME.

271
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,643
AND NOW I'VE GOT TO TAKE HER 
AND HER DOG TO THE PARK.

272
00:10:03,643 --> 00:10:05,725
- YOU'VE GOT WORK TO DO. 
YOU'VE GOT TO READ THAT PLEA.

273
00:10:05,725 --> 00:10:07,046
- I KNOW.

274
00:10:07,046 --> 00:10:08,688
THAT'S WHAT I WAS TRYING 
TO DO LAST NIGHT

275
00:10:08,688 --> 00:10:10,009
WHEN YOU PUT ME UP TO ALL THIS.

276
00:10:10,009 --> 00:10:11,891
- NO, I DIDN'T. 
- YES, YOU DID.

277
00:10:11,891 --> 00:10:13,252
- I TOLD YOU TO WALK AWAY.

278
00:10:13,252 --> 00:10:14,934
I TOLD YOU 
TO GIVE A FAKE NAME.

279
00:10:14,934 --> 00:10:16,335
- I DID. 
THANKS VERY MUCH.

280
00:10:16,335 --> 00:10:18,618
I'M CHARETH CUTESTORY, 
A PIRATE LAWYER.

281
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:20,419
IT WAS AIRTIGHT.

282
00:10:20,419 --> 00:10:22,581
- BOY, YOU HAD TO WORK HARD 
TO BAG THIS BLIND GIRL, HUH?

283
00:10:22,581 --> 00:10:24,463
- I CERTAINLY CAN'T 
TAKE ADVANTAGE OF HER NOW,

284
00:10:24,463 --> 00:10:25,504
KNOWING WHAT I KNOW.

285
00:10:25,504 --> 00:10:26,746
- WHAT? NO.

286
00:10:26,746 --> 00:10:28,547
MICHAEL, YOU CAN! 
DON'T YOU--

287
00:10:28,547 --> 00:10:31,150
YOU'VE JUST WON THE GOLD MEDAL 
AT THE SEXUAL SPECIAL OLYMPICS!

288
00:10:31,150 --> 00:10:33,072
SHE CAN'T EVER FIND YOU AGAIN.

289
00:10:33,072 --> 00:10:35,354
DON'T YOU SEE 
THAT YOU'RE SO LUCKY?

290
00:10:35,354 --> 00:10:38,678
GOD! HOW DO YOU NOT S-- 
- WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU?

291
00:10:38,678 --> 00:10:41,200
DIDN'T YOU "BAG" SOME WOMAN 
YOU'RE NEVER GOING TO SEE AGAIN?

292
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,682
- WELL, I SCREWED UP.

293
00:10:42,682 --> 00:10:45,164
I BROKE A COUPLE 
OF MY OWN RULES LAST NIGHT.

294
00:10:45,164 --> 00:10:47,246
SHE KNOWS 
THAT I'M GOB BLUTH...

295
00:10:47,246 --> 00:10:50,289
AND WE GOT MARRIED 
AND I JUST--

296
00:10:50,289 --> 00:10:53,252
- WHAT? 
- WELL, SHE WAS A DARER.

297
00:10:53,252 --> 00:10:55,014
SHE'S ONE OF THOSE GIRLS 
WHO JUST DARES YOU

298
00:10:55,014 --> 00:10:56,375
TO DO THINGS.

299
00:10:56,375 --> 00:10:58,738
- YOU MARRIED HER? 
- I NEEDED A DARE!

300
00:10:58,738 --> 00:11:00,019
[narrator] 
WHAT HAD STARTED

301
00:11:00,019 --> 00:11:01,540
AS AN INNOCENT FLIRTATION...

302
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:03,863
HAD TURNED INTO A SERIES 
OF ESCALATING CHALLENGES.

303
00:11:03,863 --> 00:11:07,266
UNFORTUNATELY, 
THE EVENING WAS DRAINING...

304
00:11:07,266 --> 00:11:09,348
AND THE ONE THING THEY NEVER 
DARED EACH OTHER TO DO

305
00:11:09,348 --> 00:11:10,870
WAS CONSUMMATE THE MARRIAGE.

306
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:12,792
- WELL, GUESS IT'S TIME 
TO SEAL THE DEAL.

307
00:11:12,792 --> 00:11:15,674
- OH, WAIT! WHAT TIME IS IT? 
OH, GOD! "SEAL THE DEAL."

308
00:11:15,674 --> 00:11:18,277
MY SEAL DEAL! 
I GOTTA GET TO SEA LAND.

309
00:11:18,277 --> 00:11:20,159
I'M SELLING 
FIVE OF THEIR SICKEST SEALS

310
00:11:20,159 --> 00:11:21,640
TO A THIRD-WORLD ZOO.

311
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:23,082
- DID YOU SAY SEALS?

312
00:11:23,082 --> 00:11:25,204
- YES! I TOLD YOU FOUR HOURS 
AGO, I SELL SEALS!

313
00:11:25,204 --> 00:11:26,645
GOD! DO YOU EVER 
LISTEN TO WHAT I SAY?

314
00:11:26,645 --> 00:11:28,487
- I'M SORRY

315
00:11:28,487 --> 00:11:30,689
I DON'T MEMORIZE EVERY WORD 
THAT COMES OUT OF YOUR MOUTH.

316
00:11:30,689 --> 00:11:32,051
SOMETIMES 
I JUST LIKE TO THINK--

317
00:11:32,051 --> 00:11:33,492
THINK MY THOUGHTS.

318
00:11:33,492 --> 00:11:35,614
- WE'LL TALK ABOUT THIS 
WHEN I GET HOME.

319
00:11:35,614 --> 00:11:37,897
- IT WAS HOT.

320
00:11:37,897 --> 00:11:40,219
- BOY, THE LENGTHS YOU'LL GO 
TO SLEEP WITH A WOMAN.

321
00:11:40,219 --> 00:11:41,901
- BELIEVE ME, 
WE DIDN'T DO ANY SLEEPING.

322
00:11:41,901 --> 00:11:43,502
I HAD SEX LAST NIGHT.

323
00:11:43,502 --> 00:11:44,904
[narrator] 
BUT HE REALLY DIDN'T.

324
00:11:44,904 --> 00:11:46,305
- YES, I DID.

325
00:11:46,305 --> 00:11:47,466
[narrator] 
AND LATER,

326
00:11:47,466 --> 00:11:48,748
MICHAEL ARRIVED FOR HIS DATE.

327
00:11:48,748 --> 00:11:50,069
- HEY!

328
00:11:50,069 --> 00:11:51,350
- I'M SO SORRY 
THAT I'M LATE.

329
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:52,711
- I THOUGHT 
I SMELLED YOU COMING.

330
00:11:52,711 --> 00:11:53,913
- MM. YEAH, HERE I AM.

331
00:11:53,913 --> 00:11:55,915
- I THOUGHT SO. 
DID YOU SMELL HIM?

332
00:11:55,915 --> 00:11:57,516
DID YOU SMELL THE HANDSOME MAN, 
JUSTICE?

333
00:11:57,516 --> 00:11:59,358
- "HANDSOME."

334
00:11:59,358 --> 00:12:01,160
YOU DON'T HAVE 
ANY EVIDENCE OF HANDSOME.

335
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:02,401
- WELL, THAT'S TRUE.

336
00:12:02,401 --> 00:12:04,043
BUT I CAN FEEL HANDSOME.

337
00:12:04,043 --> 00:12:05,364
- MMM.

338
00:12:05,364 --> 00:12:07,206
- THAT FEELS HANDSOMEY. 
[chuckles]

339
00:12:07,206 --> 00:12:08,968
SO YOU DIDN'T GET A CASE OF

340
00:12:08,968 --> 00:12:11,490
"I JUST HAD A ONE-NIGHT STAND 
WITH A BLIND GIRL"-ITUS?

341
00:12:11,490 --> 00:12:13,853
- NO, OF COURSE NOT. 
ONE-NIGHT STAND? PLEASE!

342
00:12:13,853 --> 00:12:15,134
THIS IS 
OUR SECOND DATE NOW.

343
00:12:15,134 --> 00:12:16,455
AND I WANNA SEE--

344
00:12:16,455 --> 00:12:18,697
AND I WANNA SEE YOU AGAIN 
TONIGHT, SO, UM,

345
00:12:18,697 --> 00:12:21,500
IF IT'S A ONE-NIGHT STAND, 
I'M NOT VERY GOOD AT IT.

346
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:22,741
- BUT NOW, LISTEN,

347
00:12:22,741 --> 00:12:24,583
AREN'T YOU BUSY 
WITH THE TRIAL?

348
00:12:24,583 --> 00:12:26,265
- UM, YES, OF COURSE.

349
00:12:26,265 --> 00:12:28,627
I'M VERY, VERY BUSY. 
BUT NOT TOO BUSY FOR YOU.

350
00:12:28,627 --> 00:12:29,829
NOT TOO BUSY 
FOR A LITTLE WALK

351
00:12:29,829 --> 00:12:31,430
RIGHT NOW MAYBE.

352
00:12:31,430 --> 00:12:33,232
I'LL BE YOUR SEEING EYE DOG. 
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

353
00:12:33,232 --> 00:12:34,513
OKAY?

354
00:12:34,513 --> 00:12:36,195
- OH. SHOULD WE LEAVE 
JUSTICE HERE?

355
00:12:36,195 --> 00:12:39,038
- UM, YES. HE'LL BE FINE, 
WON'T YOU, BOY? HUH?

356
00:12:39,038 --> 00:12:42,521
- JUSTICE, STAY! STAY!

357
00:12:42,521 --> 00:12:45,244
DESCRIBE THIS 
TO ME, CHARETH.

358
00:12:45,244 --> 00:12:47,807
DESCRIBE TO ME 
HOW BEAUTIFUL THE PARK IS.

359
00:12:47,807 --> 00:12:51,010
- OH, I WISH YOU COULD SEE IT. 
IT'S JUST BEAUTIFUL.

360
00:12:51,010 --> 00:12:53,772
THERE'S AN ELDERLY COUPLE 
WALKING HAND IN HAND.

361
00:12:53,772 --> 00:12:55,254
THEY'RE HAVING 
A WONDERFUL TIME.

362
00:12:55,254 --> 00:12:56,856
- YEAH?

363
00:12:56,856 --> 00:12:58,858
- "ALREADY SERVED, 
NOT TO EXCEED SIX YEARS

364
00:12:58,858 --> 00:13:01,660
BUT NO LESS THAN THREE--"

365
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:05,624
UH, THREE YEARS 
IS WHAT I GIVE THEM...

366
00:13:05,624 --> 00:13:07,426
AND THEN ONE OF THEM DIES 
AND THE OTHER ONE

367
00:13:07,426 --> 00:13:08,988
IS NOT TOO FAR BEHIND.

368
00:13:08,988 --> 00:13:10,910
- I CAN SMELL 
RIGHT THROUGH YOU, CHARETH.

369
00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:12,391
YOU'RE READING.

370
00:13:12,391 --> 00:13:14,313
- LEASH YOUR DOG, 
YOU-- [beep]

371
00:13:14,313 --> 00:13:15,594
- UH, YES.

372
00:13:15,594 --> 00:13:17,276
- [chuckles] 
YEAH.

373
00:13:17,276 --> 00:13:18,797
[narrator] 
AND GEORGE SR.

374
00:13:18,797 --> 00:13:20,880
WAS WORKING ON A ROADSIDE 
BEAUTIFICATION EFFORT...

375
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,321
BROKERED 
BY WARDEN STEFAN GENTLES.

376
00:13:22,321 --> 00:13:24,283
- INMATE BLUTH. 
- YES, SIR?

377
00:13:24,283 --> 00:13:26,325
- I WANT YOU TO KNOW 
THAT LAST NIGHT...

378
00:13:26,325 --> 00:13:28,367
I WATCHED 
A VERY IMPRESSIVE VIDEOTAPE

379
00:13:28,367 --> 00:13:30,049
OF THE TITLE CAGED WISDOM.

380
00:13:30,049 --> 00:13:33,692
I WAS STRUCK BY THE DUAL LIFE 
OF THE SPIRITUAL MAN.

381
00:13:33,692 --> 00:13:35,294
AND I DID VERY MUCH ENJOY

382
00:13:35,294 --> 00:13:37,056
THE BLOOPER BONUS FOOTAGE 
AT THE END.

383
00:13:37,056 --> 00:13:38,697
[laughs]

384
00:13:38,697 --> 00:13:40,499
- WELL, YOU KNOW, 
I ALMOST DID STRANGLE MYSELF

385
00:13:40,499 --> 00:13:41,620
ON MY OWN PRAYER SHAWL.

386
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:43,462
- A SELF-CHOKING 
FOR THE AGES.

387
00:13:43,462 --> 00:13:45,544
THERE'S A SHASTA CAN THERE 
YOU SEEMED TO HAVE MISSED.

388
00:13:45,544 --> 00:13:47,226
- OKAY.

389
00:13:47,226 --> 00:13:49,068
[narrator] 
MOMENTS LATER, CINDI ARRIVED.

390
00:13:49,068 --> 00:13:50,309
- THANK YOU, WARDEN.

391
00:13:50,309 --> 00:13:51,790
- GEORGE! 
I HAD TO SEE YOU.

392
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:55,274
I'M SORRY I LEFT BEFORE. 
I JUST FELT SO AWFUL.

393
00:13:55,274 --> 00:13:57,596
BUT I KEPT 
THINKING ABOUT US.

394
00:13:57,596 --> 00:13:59,358
- YES. 
- ABOUT OUR FUTURE.

395
00:13:59,358 --> 00:14:00,639
YES, I--

396
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:02,281
- AND I KNOW FOR A FACT 
WE CAN HAVE ONE.

397
00:14:02,281 --> 00:14:04,283
- OKAY. WHAT EVIDENCE 
DO THEY HAVE ON ME?

398
00:14:04,283 --> 00:14:05,724
YOU KEEP TALKING ABOUT A FACT?

399
00:14:05,724 --> 00:14:07,646
YOU KEEP SAYING, 
"I KNOW FOR A FACT."

400
00:14:07,646 --> 00:14:10,209
WHAT FACT? 
- FAITH.

401
00:14:10,209 --> 00:14:14,573
I HAVE FAITH 
MY PRAYERS WILL FREE YOU.

402
00:14:14,573 --> 00:14:17,696
- FAITH IS NOT A FACT! 
- OH, YES, IT IS.

403
00:14:17,696 --> 00:14:20,459
YOU SAID SO YOURSELF 
IN CAGED WISDOM.

404
00:14:20,459 --> 00:14:21,941
[narrator] 
GEORGE SR. HAD SAID

405
00:14:21,941 --> 00:14:23,702
"FAITH IS A FACT."

406
00:14:23,702 --> 00:14:25,744
UNFORTUNATELY, 
IT WAS IN THE CAGED WISDOM

407
00:14:25,744 --> 00:14:27,266
BLOOPER BONUS FOOTAGE.

408
00:14:27,266 --> 00:14:30,469
- FAITH IS A FACT. 
NO. FAITH IS A FACET.

409
00:14:30,469 --> 00:14:33,752
I ALMOST SAID FAITH IS A FACT. 
[wheezy laugh]

410
00:14:33,752 --> 00:14:37,396
I AM GOING TO TRIAL 
BECAUSE YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND

411
00:14:37,396 --> 00:14:39,558
WHAT A BLOOPER REEL IS? 
GUARD!

412
00:14:43,242 --> 00:14:44,924
[narrator] 
BACK AT THE HIGH SCHOOL,

413
00:14:44,924 --> 00:14:46,245
GEORGE MICHAEL RAN INTO MAEBY.

414
00:14:46,245 --> 00:14:48,247
- I GOT AN "A." 
CHECK IT OUT.

415
00:14:48,247 --> 00:14:49,608
GREAT JOB. 
TAKE SOME MORE MONEY.

416
00:14:49,608 --> 00:14:51,330
LOOK. 
I GOTTA GO.

417
00:14:51,330 --> 00:14:53,412
I'M GOING TO THIS FUND-RAISER 
FOR A SICK GIRL, OKAY?

418
00:14:53,412 --> 00:14:54,533
[narrator] 
THIS RANG FALSE

419
00:14:54,533 --> 00:14:56,255
TO GEORGE MICHAEL,

420
00:14:56,255 --> 00:14:58,417
WHO KNEW THAT FUND-RAISERS, 
A PASSION OF HER MOTHER'S,

421
00:14:58,417 --> 00:15:00,699
WERE SOMETHING 
THAT MAEBY WOULD AVOID.

422
00:15:00,699 --> 00:15:02,821
AND LATER, 
AT THE COURTHOUSE--

423
00:15:02,821 --> 00:15:05,664
- GOOD AFTERNOON. 
- THANK GOD.

424
00:15:05,664 --> 00:15:06,946
SO DID YOU READ THE PLEA?

425
00:15:06,946 --> 00:15:08,867
WE'VE GOT MINUTES HERE, 
NOT HOURS.

426
00:15:08,867 --> 00:15:11,550
- I DID READ IT. MOST OF IT. 
UM, I DEFINITELY--

427
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:12,992
DEFINITELY READ THIS, UH--

428
00:15:12,992 --> 00:15:15,554
THE FIRST PART OF THIS FIRST, 
UH, SECTION.

429
00:15:15,554 --> 00:15:16,755
UH, NO. 
DID NOT READ IT.

430
00:15:16,755 --> 00:15:18,197
- OH, COME ON, MICHAEL.

431
00:15:18,197 --> 00:15:19,919
HOW MANY TIMES 
ARE YOU GOING TO SCREW UP...

432
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:21,440
BEFORE THE REST 
OF THIS FAMILY SEES YOU

433
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,441
FOR THE SCREWUP YOU ARE?

434
00:15:22,441 --> 00:15:23,682
- I'M NOT THE LAWYER.

435
00:15:23,682 --> 00:15:25,084
ALL RIGHT? 
WHY DIDN'T YOU READ IT?

436
00:15:25,084 --> 00:15:26,885
- EXCUSE ME. I GOT BUSY 
WITH MY OTHER CLIENTS.

437
00:15:26,885 --> 00:15:28,287
- WHAT OTHER CLIENTS?

438
00:15:28,287 --> 00:15:29,969
- HE DOESN'T KNOW 
ABOUT THE DIVORCE?

439
00:15:29,969 --> 00:15:31,890
- IT'S AN ANNULMENT. 
- OH, I LOOKED INTO THAT TOO.

440
00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:33,532
YOU CAN ONLY GET AN ANNULMENT

441
00:15:33,532 --> 00:15:35,574
IF YOU HAVEN'T CONSUMMATED 
THE MARRIAGE FIRST.

442
00:15:35,574 --> 00:15:38,777
- WELL, I GUESS 
I'LL JUST STAY MARRIED THEN,

443
00:15:38,777 --> 00:15:43,622
BECAUSE WE ALL KNOW THAT 
I CLOSED THAT DEAL, RIGHT?

444
00:15:43,622 --> 00:15:45,664
[narrator] 
BUT HE REALLY DIDN'T.

445
00:15:45,664 --> 00:15:47,026
- HE WAS TALKING 
ABOUT MY DIVORCE.

446
00:15:47,026 --> 00:15:48,347
- YOUR WHAT?

447
00:15:48,347 --> 00:15:50,149
- YOU AND DAD 
ARE GETTING DIVORCED?

448
00:15:50,149 --> 00:15:52,431
- OH, DON'T WORRY, SWEETIE. 
NO ONE IS FIGHTING OVER YOU.

449
00:15:52,431 --> 00:15:55,154
AND DON'T WORRY ABOUT 
BARRY READING THE PLEA.

450
00:15:55,154 --> 00:15:56,996
WE'LL LET YOUR FATHER 
ROT IN PRISON.

451
00:15:56,996 --> 00:15:59,078
- TAKE THE PLEA. 
WE'RE TAKING THE PLEA!

452
00:15:59,078 --> 00:16:01,080
- WE'RE GOING TO TRIAL, 
YOU'RE GOING TO LOSE, AND

453
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:02,921
YOU'RE GOING TO STAY IN THERE.

454
00:16:02,921 --> 00:16:06,005
- THAT'S ENOUGH, MOM. 
- FOR HIM? NOTHING'S ENOUGH.

455
00:16:06,005 --> 00:16:07,846
YOU'D THINK 
A MAN LOCKED UP IN PRISON

456
00:16:07,846 --> 00:16:09,768
WOULD BE ABLE TO ABSTAIN.

457
00:16:09,768 --> 00:16:14,093
YOUR FATHER, 
WITH HIS DISGUSTING TWEAKING!

458
00:16:14,093 --> 00:16:15,734
I COULDN'T BREAST-FEED 
ANY OF YOU KIDS

459
00:16:15,734 --> 00:16:16,735
BECAUSE OF THAT MAN!

460
00:16:16,735 --> 00:16:17,776
- AWW! 
- SHH.,

461
00:16:17,776 --> 00:16:19,818
- THEY STILL LOOK FABULOUS.

462
00:16:19,818 --> 00:16:21,740
- LUCILLE, FOR GOD'S SAKES. 
SHE WAS AN INFORMANT.

463
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:23,422
SHE WAS 
WORKING FOR THE GOVERNMENT.

464
00:16:23,422 --> 00:16:25,824
THE ONLY THING I WAS PUMPING HER 
FOR WAS INFORMATION, HONEY.

465
00:16:25,824 --> 00:16:26,825
- AN INFORMANT.

466
00:16:26,825 --> 00:16:28,187
DAD, ARE YOU CRAZY?

467
00:16:28,187 --> 00:16:29,989
YOU'RE 
GONNA BLOW THIS WHOLE CASE.

468
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:31,950
- IT'S BLOWN. IT'S OVER. 
IT'S DEAD. TAKE THE PLEA.

469
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:33,792
GET ME OUT THERE.

470
00:16:33,792 --> 00:16:36,115
- LETS TAKE THE PLEA, OKAY? 
LOOK. IT'S SO NICE AND THICK.

471
00:16:36,115 --> 00:16:39,798
- OH, GEORGE, I SHOULD HAVE 
NEVER DOUBTED YOU.

472
00:16:39,798 --> 00:16:41,400
EVEN WHEN YOU SLEPT 
WITH MY SISTER,

473
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,841
IT WAS FOR A GOOD REASON.

474
00:16:42,841 --> 00:16:44,483
- GOT HER TO STOP DRINKING, 
DIDN'T IT?

475
00:16:44,483 --> 00:16:45,724
- ALL RIGHT, LISTEN.

476
00:16:45,724 --> 00:16:47,366
THIS IS 
ALL GETTING A LITTLE CRAZY.

477
00:16:47,366 --> 00:16:49,568
WE CANNOT ACCEPT THEIR 
CONDITIONS IF WE DON'T KNOW

478
00:16:49,568 --> 00:16:50,929
WHAT THEIR CONDITIONS ARE.

479
00:16:50,929 --> 00:16:52,691
- DO YOU WANNA READ IT?

480
00:16:52,691 --> 00:16:55,454
UH, NO. IT IS THICK. 
WHY DON'T WE JUST TAKE IT?

481
00:16:55,454 --> 00:16:56,735
- I COULD KISS YOU ON THE-- 
[beep]

482
00:16:56,735 --> 00:16:58,297
- WELL, LET'S-- WHAT?

483
00:16:58,297 --> 00:16:59,898
[narrator] 
AND SO THE FAMILY GATHERED

484
00:16:59,898 --> 00:17:00,939
IN THE COURTROOM...

485
00:17:00,939 --> 00:17:02,421
TO ANNOUNCE THEIR DECISION.

486
00:17:02,421 --> 00:17:04,783
- ALL RISE. 
THE COURT IS NOW IN SESSION.

487
00:17:04,783 --> 00:17:06,745
THE HONORABLE LIONEL PING 
PRESIDING.

488
00:17:06,745 --> 00:17:08,747
- OH, WE'VE GOT PING AGAIN.

489
00:17:08,747 --> 00:17:11,150
- PLEASE BE SEATED.

490
00:17:11,150 --> 00:17:14,193
THE PROSECUTION 
HAS OFFERED A PLEA?

491
00:17:14,193 --> 00:17:18,717
- WE HAVE, YOUR HONOR. 
- WE'VE GOT LIZER.

492
00:17:18,717 --> 00:17:20,279
[narrator] 
YES, MAGGIE WAS

493
00:17:20,279 --> 00:17:22,961
THE MOST FEARED PROSECUTOR 
IN ALL OF ORANGE COUNTY.

494
00:17:22,961 --> 00:17:24,723
- AND, THEREFORE,

495
00:17:24,723 --> 00:17:28,047
I WOULD LIKE TO BRING 
YOUR ATTENTION TO EXHIBIT "A."

496
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:29,328
[narrator] 
NOT BECAUSE SHE WAS

497
00:17:29,328 --> 00:17:31,210
A PARTICULARLY ADEPT LAWYER,

498
00:17:31,210 --> 00:17:32,931
BUT BECAUSE SHE WON 
THE SYMPATHY NOT ONLY

499
00:17:32,931 --> 00:17:34,373
OF THE JURY AND THE JUDGE--

500
00:17:34,373 --> 00:17:40,099
- AND WAS THAT MAN IN THE ROOM, 
NOT YOU, DOCTOR?

501
00:17:40,099 --> 00:17:41,580
[narrator] 
BUT OFTEN TIMES,

502
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:42,901
THE DEFENDANTS THEMSELVES.

503
00:17:42,901 --> 00:17:45,584
- I-- I WAS IN THAT ROOM.

504
00:17:45,584 --> 00:17:47,626
- IS THE DEFENSE 
READY TO RESPOND?

505
00:17:47,626 --> 00:17:49,148
- WHAT ARE YOU HIDING FROM?

506
00:17:49,148 --> 00:17:51,110
- [whispering] 
YOU'VE GOT TO CALL THIS OFF.

507
00:17:51,110 --> 00:17:53,552
YOU GOTTA GET MORE TIME. 
GET MORE TIME. SHE CAN SMELL.

508
00:17:53,552 --> 00:17:55,514
SHE SMELLS EVERYTHING.

509
00:17:58,797 --> 00:18:02,401
- OBJECTION! 
- WHAT?

510
00:18:02,401 --> 00:18:04,563
- WE HAVEN'T READ IT.

511
00:18:04,563 --> 00:18:05,724
IT'S VERY LONG, YOUR HONOR.

512
00:18:05,724 --> 00:18:07,726
- [whispers] 
SIT DOWN!

513
00:18:07,726 --> 00:18:09,848
- WE HAVEN'T READ IT.

514
00:18:09,848 --> 00:18:12,491
WE'RE GONNA GET TO IT. 
I'M GONNA START RIGHT NOW.

515
00:18:12,491 --> 00:18:14,933
- THAT'S THE BLIND CHICK 
YOU SLEPT WITH?

516
00:18:14,933 --> 00:18:16,775
MICHAEL, YOU'RE IN BED 
WITH THE PROSECUTION?

517
00:18:16,775 --> 00:18:18,217
- IT'S GENIUS.

518
00:18:18,217 --> 00:18:19,778
YOU CAN GET 
ALL THE INFORMATION WE NEED.

519
00:18:19,778 --> 00:18:21,300
- WAIT A MINUTE.

520
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:23,502
HOW DO WE KNOW IT'S NOT A TRAP? 
MAYBE SHE'S SETTING YOU UP.

521
00:18:23,502 --> 00:18:24,903
- IT'S NOT A SETUP, OKAY?

522
00:18:24,903 --> 00:18:27,106
SHE GAVE ME HER REAL NAME. 
SHE SAID THAT SHE WAS A LAWYER.

523
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:29,067
I'M THE ONE THAT LIED TO HER. 
I GOTTA GO TALK TO HER.

524
00:18:29,067 --> 00:18:30,509
- NO!

525
00:18:30,509 --> 00:18:32,271
- NO, MICHAEL! 
YOU CAN SAVE THIS FAMILY.

526
00:18:32,271 --> 00:18:34,273
PLEASE! 
DO THE RIGHT THING HERE.

527
00:18:34,273 --> 00:18:36,515
STRING THIS BLIND GIRL ALONG 
SO THAT DAD DOESN'T HAVE TO

528
00:18:36,515 --> 00:18:38,317
PAY HIS DEBT TO SOCIETY.

529
00:18:38,317 --> 00:18:40,199
- THE SOLUTION 
TO ALL OUR PROBLEMS

530
00:18:40,199 --> 00:18:42,921
IS STARING YOU RIGHT IN THE FACE 
AND IT CAN'T EVEN SEE YOU.

531
00:18:42,921 --> 00:18:44,803
- I GOTTA GO TALK TO HER. 
- [sighs]

532
00:18:44,803 --> 00:18:47,606
YEAH, I BETTER 
GET BACK TO THE WIFE.

533
00:18:47,606 --> 00:18:49,888
- I THINK I'M GOING TO 
TAKE A SCENIC DRIVE DOWN

534
00:18:49,888 --> 00:18:51,570
TO THE CITY OF INDUSTRY.

535
00:18:51,570 --> 00:18:53,132
[narrator] 
AND GEORGE MICHAEL WENT TO

536
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:54,573
THE FUND-RAISER...

537
00:18:54,573 --> 00:18:56,415
FOR THE SICK STUDENT 
MAEBY HAD MENTIONED,

538
00:18:56,415 --> 00:18:58,377
BUT WAS SURPRISED 
NOT TO SEE MAEBY THERE.

539
00:18:58,377 --> 00:19:01,220
- WE HAVE BEEN BLESSED TO HAVE 
IN OUR MIDST A CHILD WHO HAS

540
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:03,502
SHOWN US THE MEANING OF COURAGE.

541
00:19:03,502 --> 00:19:07,346
NOW LET'S SHOW HER 
THE MEANING OF CHARITY.

542
00:19:07,346 --> 00:19:09,268
PLEASE WELCOME-- 
SURELY FUNKE!

543
00:19:09,268 --> 00:19:10,549
[narrator] 
AND THAT'S WHEN

544
00:19:10,549 --> 00:19:12,191
GEORGE MICHAEL REALIZED...

545
00:19:12,191 --> 00:19:14,593
MAEBY HAD BEEN MAKING MONEY 
BY PRETENDING TO BE

546
00:19:14,593 --> 00:19:16,675
TWO TWIN GIRLS--

547
00:19:16,675 --> 00:19:18,076
- MAEBY?

548
00:19:18,076 --> 00:19:19,598
[narrator] 
ONE OF WHOM WAS ILL.

549
00:19:19,598 --> 00:19:21,440
- [coughing]

550
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,322
- SOMEBODY 
GET HER A CUPCAKE!

551
00:19:23,322 --> 00:19:25,083
[narrator] 
AND MICHAEL WENT TO MAGGIE'S

552
00:19:25,083 --> 00:19:26,965
DETERMINED TO TELL THE TRUTH.

553
00:19:26,965 --> 00:19:29,688
- WHAT A SURPRISE. 
COME ON IN.

554
00:19:31,009 --> 00:19:32,211
- HEY, I'M IN. 
HELLO. SORRY.

555
00:19:32,211 --> 00:19:34,213
- OH. HEY.

556
00:19:34,213 --> 00:19:35,974
I THOUGHT YOU WERE 
GOING TO BE MY READER.

557
00:19:35,974 --> 00:19:37,456
- YEAH? 
OH, YOU'RE WORKING?

558
00:19:37,456 --> 00:19:38,897
- YEAH, I GOT A BREAK.

559
00:19:38,897 --> 00:19:40,699
I WASN'T PREPARED, 
THANKS TO YOU.

560
00:19:40,699 --> 00:19:42,581
- MM. 
[chuckles]

561
00:19:42,581 --> 00:19:44,423
- WHAT ABOUT YOU?

562
00:19:44,423 --> 00:19:46,865
DON'T TELL ME ANOTHER PIRATE 
IS STILL ROAMING THE HIGH SEAS.

563
00:19:46,865 --> 00:19:48,827
[laughs]

564
00:19:50,589 --> 00:19:52,431
- UH, HEY. YOU KNOW, 
LET'S MAKE A DEAL.

565
00:19:52,431 --> 00:19:54,393
YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO THIS 
ANYMORE, CAUSE I'M GONNA

566
00:19:54,393 --> 00:19:56,195
START LAUGHING OUT LOUD.

567
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:57,956
- OKAY, THAT'S GONNA 
HELP ME SO MUCH.

568
00:19:57,956 --> 00:19:59,558
- ALL RIGHT. 
LET'S GO SIT DOWN.

569
00:19:59,558 --> 00:20:01,039
SO, UH, MAGGIE. 
[clears throat]

570
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:02,040
- YEAH?

571
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:05,964
- I AM NOT TRYING A CASE.

572
00:20:05,964 --> 00:20:07,726
- THAT'S FANTASTIC! 
THEY SETTLED. GREAT.

573
00:20:07,726 --> 00:20:09,248
- WELL--

574
00:20:09,248 --> 00:20:12,691
- LISTEN, I KNOW 
I SHOULDN'T DO THIS, BUT--

575
00:20:12,691 --> 00:20:14,733
BUT I AM SO BEHIND, 
AND I REALLY DO FEEL

576
00:20:14,733 --> 00:20:17,536
AS IF I CAN TRUST YOU.

577
00:20:17,536 --> 00:20:19,137
- YEAH? 
WHAT IS THIS?

578
00:20:19,137 --> 00:20:20,659
- WELL, YOU OUGHT TO KNOW. 
YOU CAN SEE.

579
00:20:20,659 --> 00:20:22,020
[laughs]

580
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:24,223
- [contrived laughter ] 
MAGGIE!

581
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:25,624
WHAT IS IT? 
SERIOUSLY.

582
00:20:25,624 --> 00:20:27,466
- WELL, BASICALLY,

583
00:20:27,466 --> 00:20:29,147
IT'S AN OVERVIEW 
OF THE GOVERNMENT'S CASE

584
00:20:29,147 --> 00:20:30,949
AGAINST THE BLUTH FAMILY.

585
00:20:30,949 --> 00:20:33,552
IT'S A SUMMARY OF ABSOLUTELY 
EVERYTHING WE'VE GOT.

586
00:20:33,552 --> 00:20:35,514
- AND YOU'RE JUST GOING 
TO GIVE IT TO ME?

587
00:20:35,514 --> 00:20:37,716
- YOU'RE A LAWYER. 
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

588
00:20:37,716 --> 00:20:39,678
DO WE HAVE A CASE?

589
00:20:39,678 --> 00:20:42,281
- [mouthing words]

590
00:20:42,281 --> 00:20:43,562
[narrator] 
ON THE NEXT

591
00:20:43,562 --> 00:20:45,163
ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT.

592
00:20:45,163 --> 00:20:47,366
MAEBY ATTEMPTS 
TO DEPOSIT HER CHECK.

593
00:20:49,047 --> 00:20:51,850
GOB ADAPTS TO MARRIED LIFE. 
- UNBELIEVABLE!

594
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:53,292
THE SEAL DEAL FELL THROUGH.

595
00:20:53,292 --> 00:20:55,093
THREE OF THE SEALS DIED 
ON THEIR WAY TO CHAD.

596
00:20:55,093 --> 00:20:56,855
HOW AM I EVER GONNA FIND 
A MARITIME LAWYER?

597
00:20:56,855 --> 00:20:58,297
- I'M SORRY, 
DID YOU SAY "SEALS"?

598
00:20:58,297 --> 00:20:59,618
- YES!

599
00:20:59,618 --> 00:21:01,179
I TRADE TRAINED 
SEALS FOR A LIVING.

600
00:21:01,179 --> 00:21:03,582
DO YOU EVER LISTEN? 
- DO YOU EVER STOP TALKING?

601
00:21:03,582 --> 00:21:05,143
[narrator] 
TOBIAS IS SENT TO BREAK

602
00:21:05,143 --> 00:21:06,184
INTO MAGGIE'S HOUSE

603
00:21:06,184 --> 00:21:07,386
TO STEAL EVIDENCE.

604
00:21:13,592 --> 00:21:17,876
ONLY TO DISCOVER 
THAT SHE'S NOT BLIND.
