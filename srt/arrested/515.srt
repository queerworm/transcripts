00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:53,973
<i>the DA didn't immediately call</i>
<i>for a mistrial.</i>

167
00:07:54,348 --> 00:07:55,892
[Dusty] I'm feeling
like people are judging me,

168
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:59,020
and it's just not making me feel
that great.

169
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:02,064
I-- I feel like I got, like, totally

170
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:03,816
-the hard part of this case.
-[Lottie hushes]

171
00:08:04,108 --> 00:08:07,153
-[quietly] What the hell is going on?
-[Ron] <i>Although she did show</i>

172
00:08:07,236 --> 00:08:09,447
<i>uncommon empathy</i>
<i>to the opposing counsel.</i>

173
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:11,491
[softly] You can do it. You're ready.

174
00:08:13,034 --> 00:08:14,494
Everything go okay last night?

175
00:08:15,203 --> 00:08:17,288
I think I made a terrible mistake.

176
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:18,998
[Ron] <i>In fact, she had,</i>

177
00:08:19,081 --> 00:08:21,042
<i>as, the night before, while believing</i>

178
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:24,045
<i>she was paying a carnal visit to Dusty...</i>

179
00:08:24,128 --> 00:08:25,838
[Lucille] Oh, it's so dark in here.

180
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:28,090
[filtered breathing]

181
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:30,593
[Lucille] Hello? [gasps]

182
00:08:31,093 --> 00:08:33,971
-I can hear you breathing.
-[steady beeping]

183
00:08:34,138 --> 00:08:37,058
[Lucille chuckling] Oh,
so you <i>did </i>know I was coming.

184
00:08:37,975 --> 00:08:40,978
Good for you, getting a head start.

185
00:08:42,146 --> 00:08:44,190
-And speaking of that...
-[bed squeaks]

186
00:08:44,273 --> 00:08:47,151
{\an8}[Ron] <i>But, had the lights been on,</i>
<i>Lucille would have discovered</i>

187
00:08:47,235 --> 00:08:49,904
{\an8}<i>that the tubes and other accoutrements</i>
<i>weren't there</i>

188
00:08:49,987 --> 00:08:51,864
{\an8}<i>-for Dusty's erotic entertainment...</i>
-[flatlining]

189
00:08:52,448 --> 00:08:54,367
{\an8}<i>-...but were instead the implements</i>

190
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:57,161
{\an8}<i>that kept Dusty's</i>

191
00:08:57,245 --> 00:09:00,331
-So, Lottie is his ex?
-[sighs]

192
00:09:00,414 --> 00:09:03,167
-Stepmom.
-[Dusty] I really appreciate this, Lottie.

193
00:09:03,251 --> 00:09:06,420
Please. I've known you since you were 30!

194
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:08,673
And you can call me "Mom."

195
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:10,716
Mom.

196
00:09:11,175 --> 00:09:13,261
If-- If the judge will allow it,

197
00:09:13,469 --> 00:09:15,805
permission to hug the defense counsel.

198
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:21,936
Hell yeah. Let's get the hug on.

199
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:23,896
-[Dusty] Yeah! Yeah!
-[Lottie laughing]

200
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:25,606
[gallery] Aw.

201
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:28,025
-[Lottie] Oh! My baby! [laughs]
-[applause]

202
00:09:28,109 --> 00:09:31,487
[Ron] <i>It would've been a great ending</i>
<i>for a feel-good movie,</i>

203
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:34,448
<i>but it was a horrible beginning</i>
<i>for a gruesome murder trial.</i>

204
00:09:34,532 --> 00:09:36,617
What a [bleep] baby! [chuckles]

205
00:09:36,701 --> 00:09:38,494
-Shut up, murderer!
-[indistinct chatter]

206
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:40,246
[quietly] Well, he is. Clearly is.

207
00:09:40,329 --> 00:09:41,956
[Ron] <i>And during a break in both the trial</i>

208
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:46,627
<i>and the hug of the opposing attorneys,</i>
<i>Lucille caught up with Dusty.</i>

209
00:09:47,044 --> 00:09:48,879
I was a little nervous.

210
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:52,842
For my first murder trial, though,
my first anything trial, not bad, right?

211
00:09:53,301 --> 00:09:54,802
That was humiliating.

212
00:09:54,885 --> 00:09:57,221
I thought Lottie was your <i>ex-wife.</i>

213
00:09:57,597 --> 00:10:00,516
Nah. I mean, she's a little old for me,
don't you think?

214
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,435
She's, like... [exhales] ...your age.

215
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:07,023
Look, I'm sorry. Maybe I wasn't clear
about our relationship.

216
00:10:07,815 --> 00:10:10,109
Uh, are you super mad at me?

217
00:10:10,192 --> 00:10:12,695
Oh, for God's sakes,
stop talking like a child.

218
00:10:12,778 --> 00:10:14,071
I mean, how old are you?

219
00:10:14,363 --> 00:10:16,657
-Fifty-six and a half.
-Jesus!

220
00:10:16,741 --> 00:10:18,075
Pull yourself together.

221
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:19,285
Absolutely.

222
00:10:19,368 --> 00:10:21,162
Not gonna let that ruin my recess.

223
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:26,792
There you are. Okay.
Now, Mom, what in the hell was that?

224
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:28,461
I thought this was Dustin Radler,

225
00:10:28,878 --> 00:10:30,296
the fierce trial attorney,

226
00:10:30,379 --> 00:10:32,548
the only one who's ever beaten Lottie.

227
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:35,551
Well, as it turns out,
the Dustin Radler I've been with...

228
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:36,636
is his son.

229
00:10:37,094 --> 00:10:39,305
Oh, my God, he's a motherboy.

230
00:10:39,513 --> 00:10:41,515
There were--
There were no hints before today?

231
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:44,268
[Lucille] Just that I only ever seem
to create or attract them.

232
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:47,730
You got us into this mess.
What are you gonna do?

233
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:50,524
All right. I made an awful choice,

234
00:10:50,608 --> 00:10:53,944
but did I give you a hard time
when you gave all our life rights

235
00:10:54,028 --> 00:10:56,656
to Imagine Films to make some TV show?

236
00:10:56,739 --> 00:10:59,992
-That was somewhat amiss of you.
-[Michael] Yes, you did.

237
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:03,871
As it turns out, nothing came
of that project, which I predicted.

238
00:11:03,954 --> 00:11:05,831
Just like I predicted your bet

239
00:11:05,915 --> 00:11:09,335
on the DA calling a mistrial
wasn't exactly beating the odds.

240
00:11:09,418 --> 00:11:11,337
-She offered him gum.
-[Lucille] Okay, I hired

241
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:14,924
a completely incompetent lawyer
and put my son's life in the hands

242
00:11:15,007 --> 00:11:17,843
of a moron, and I know
what you want me to say, Michael.

243
00:11:17,927 --> 00:11:20,638
Okay, I'll say it... My bad!

244
00:11:21,222 --> 00:11:22,223
[Lucille sighs]

245
00:11:22,973 --> 00:11:27,061
Wow. I don't think
that I have heard you apologize since, um,

246
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,939
uh, since people used to use
that phrase to apologize.

247
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:31,982
Okay, well,
I think we may have to beg the judge

248
00:11:32,066 --> 00:11:33,651
-to declare a mistrial.
-[Lucille] No.

249
00:11:33,734 --> 00:11:36,654
We have to do this now
while they still don't have a body.

250
00:11:37,321 --> 00:11:40,366
It's our best chance for acquittal.
We'll work with what we have.

251
00:11:40,449 --> 00:11:43,536
Maybe her maternal instincts will kick in,

252
00:11:43,619 --> 00:11:46,038
and we'll benefit
from her being his stepmother.

253
00:11:46,122 --> 00:11:49,041
Yeah, I don't know about that.
He's not a child, after all.

254
00:11:51,252 --> 00:11:53,295
It occurs to me that he may not come back
from recess

255
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:54,880
unless he hears a bell. I'll get him.

256
00:12:00,845 --> 00:12:02,596
[Ron] <i>As the trial was continuing,</i>

257
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:05,391
<i>Dusty was desperate</i>
<i>for </i>any <i>kind of witness.</i>

258
00:12:05,474 --> 00:12:07,643
-[Tobias] <i>...Guys and Dolls...</i>
-[Ron] <i>Even one that came</i>

259
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:09,603
<i>-with a headshot. </i>
-I was more than interested

260
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:11,856
to try out to be one
of the character witnesses

261
00:12:11,939 --> 00:12:13,524
in Buster's trial.

262
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:17,153
-Thank you for offering.
-[Buster] That's very nice.

263
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:19,905
Oh, please. I know the Buster character
better than anyone.

264
00:12:20,197 --> 00:12:22,700
I could play Buster with one arm
tied behind my back.

265
00:12:22,783 --> 00:12:26,454
In fact, I've played Buster
with <i>two </i>arms tied behind my back.

266
00:12:26,537 --> 00:12:28,038
I was handcuffed.

267
00:12:28,873 --> 00:12:31,125
Well, this is... [grunts]
They're buying it!

268
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:34,503
-[chuckling] Now, that's a witness.
-Um, we don't need you to play Buster

269
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:37,381
on the stand,
more just talk about him as a person.

270
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:40,217
Oh. Well,

271
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:43,137
you don't think
I'd be more appealing as the accused?

272
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:46,140
I mean,
the Buster <i>I </i>played could never kill.

273
00:12:46,307 --> 00:12:47,141
[Dusty] Yeah, it's--

274
00:12:47,224 --> 00:12:49,602
it's really not an acting job, man.
I can't...

275
00:12:49,685 --> 00:12:51,854
[Tobias] Yes, yes, just... don't push.
I get it.

276
00:12:51,937 --> 00:12:55,149
Just tell the story the way
you told it to me earlier today.

277
00:12:55,232 --> 00:12:57,777
Beginning with what you were doing
the night of the murder. [gasps]

278
00:12:58,027 --> 00:12:59,653
[grunts] <i>Alleged </i>murder. Alleged.

279
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:00,863
[Tobias] Yes, yes.

280
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:05,534
[takes deep breath]
It was Cinco... de Cuatro!

281
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:08,120
[Dusty] No, no, no,
I'm-- I'm gonna stop you there.

282
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:09,580
-I still feel you're acting.
-Really?

283
00:13:09,914 --> 00:13:10,956
-A little. I do.
-Huh.

284
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,918
[Tobias] So, just no script at all?
Just vérité? Okay.

285
00:13:14,001 --> 00:13:15,836
Well, uh, here it is with nothing.

286
00:13:16,712 --> 00:13:19,298
I needed somebody to play a part in my...

287
00:13:19,548 --> 00:13:24,136
<i>Fantastic-- </i>for legal purposes,
I can't say the rest of it-- musical,

288
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:26,555
and Buster happily filled in.

289
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:29,517
[Ron] <i>Well, "happily"</i>
<i>might have been an overstatement.</i>

290
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,227
I've got a show to do in ten minutes,

291
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:33,854
and I haven't got a Thing to wear...
this Thing suit.

292
00:13:33,938 --> 00:13:35,731
I gotta find Lucille 2.
I gotta give her pictures.

293
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:37,149
I don't know the songs.

294
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:39,151
You're a monster.
You don't have to be any good.

295
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:41,403
-What?
-[Tobias speaking indistinctly]

296
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:45,199
So, you're saying <i>Buster </i>was performing
as the rock monster

297
00:13:45,282 --> 00:13:48,369
when the murder allegedly took place?
Is that true, Buster?

298
00:13:48,452 --> 00:13:51,539
That's what I told you.
He asked me to that night.

299
00:13:51,622 --> 00:13:53,290
And you'll confirm that on the stand?

300
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:55,042
I will.

301
00:13:55,584 --> 00:13:59,004
[in English accent] And perhaps I'll do it
in an English accent!

302
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:02,508
[in normal voice] Nay, nay, I shan't.
I shall stick to the script.

303
00:14:02,716 --> 00:14:06,053
Not script. Nope. Vérité.
I have taken the note... vérité.

304
00:14:06,136 --> 00:14:07,179
-Yes, yes.
-Great.

305
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:09,056
Now, I do wish I could do this gratis,

306
00:14:09,139 --> 00:14:11,684
but I'm having a bit
of a shelter crisis of late.

307
00:14:11,767 --> 00:14:13,519
-I hate to play hardball--
-[Dusty] I don't think

308
00:14:13,602 --> 00:14:15,312
that they pay witnesses.

309
00:14:15,396 --> 00:14:17,815
Hmm...

310
00:14:18,315 --> 00:14:19,275
Uh, unrelated...

311
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:21,861
What happens to this room when you leave?

312
00:14:21,944 --> 00:14:23,863
Yeah, I think they lock it up at night.

313
00:14:24,321 --> 00:14:26,490
Damn it. Damn it, damn it, damn it.

314
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:31,745
Damn it!

315
00:14:32,788 --> 00:14:33,747
I just...

316
00:14:34,915 --> 00:14:37,001
[sniffles, voice breaking]
...need somewhere to s--

317
00:14:37,751 --> 00:14:41,463
[sniffles] All right, well, gentlemen,
thank you so much for your time.

318
00:14:42,798 --> 00:14:44,300
And I will be seeing you.

319
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:46,385
[Ron] <i>But back at the model home,</i>

320
00:14:46,468 --> 00:14:49,889
<i>an unemployed Michael was doing</i>
<i>his own courtroom preparation,</i>

321
00:14:49,972 --> 00:14:51,015
<i>when he had a visit...</i>

322
00:14:51,098 --> 00:14:53,642
-Hey, Dad.
<i>-...from the son who had unemployed him.</i>

323
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:54,852
Hello, son.

324
00:14:55,352 --> 00:14:57,479
-Figured you'd be up here.
-Yeah.

325
00:14:57,563 --> 00:15:00,649
Well, that's...
father-son psychic connection.

326
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:03,444
The drop stairs were down,
and you were yelling, "Where is it?"

327
00:15:03,527 --> 00:15:04,486
Oh, that helps, too.

328
00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:06,864
-Sure.
-[Michael] Trying to find old law books.

329
00:15:07,072 --> 00:15:10,159
Lottie Dottie Da did say
that Dusty would give the guilty guys

330
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:11,535
a run for their money.

331
00:15:11,619 --> 00:15:13,913
I think she was being sarcastic,
but I am free now,

332
00:15:13,996 --> 00:15:16,957
so I'm gonna try to help out in court,
which is why I'm trying to find...

333
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:19,585
[George Michael]
A copy of <i>A Few Good Men?</i>

334
00:15:19,668 --> 00:15:21,086
Look at that. How'd that get there?

335
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:24,381
[chuckles] Actually, I thought
I'd find my maritime law diploma.

336
00:15:24,465 --> 00:15:27,676
You know, as proof that I passed
what they call the "wet bar." [chuckles]

337
00:15:28,052 --> 00:15:29,929
You know,
you may not have to get involved.

338
00:15:30,012 --> 00:15:32,598
I mean, is this something
maritime law even applies to here?

339
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:35,142
It should. He dumped her in the ocean.

340
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:37,519
-True.
-[both] Allegedly.

341
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:39,521
-Obviously allegedly.
-[George Michael] I'm worried this is

342
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:41,231
part of that thing that you always do.

343
00:15:41,315 --> 00:15:44,026
You try to fix things, and you end up
putting yourself in the middle of them.

344
00:15:44,485 --> 00:15:47,613
-You have to be the hero.
-Oh, well. I do not get in the middle.

345
00:15:47,905 --> 00:15:50,950
You dated my girlfriend.
You moved into my dorm room.

346
00:15:51,033 --> 00:15:52,993
You make it sound
like I'm always in your business.

347
00:15:53,077 --> 00:15:54,578
-You bought my business.
-[Michael] Well...

348
00:15:54,662 --> 00:15:56,121
Which has been a huge headache.

349
00:15:56,205 --> 00:15:59,166
Now I have to deliver this border wall
to the Chinese.

350
00:15:59,249 --> 00:16:00,209
These are great points.

351
00:16:00,834 --> 00:16:04,588
But what you don't know is
there's a reason I had to announce that.

352
00:16:05,005 --> 00:16:06,382
I know about the foot.

353
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,676
It's why I had to fire you,
because by trying

354
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:10,552
to fix things,
you just end up putting yourself

355
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:12,346
in the middle of a much bigger risk.

356
00:16:12,429 --> 00:16:14,682
'Cause if you think the Chinese
are mad now,

357
00:16:14,765 --> 00:16:16,809
wait until they find out
that Fakeblock is not even...

358
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:20,896
perfect yet.

359
00:16:21,271 --> 00:16:22,690
So I hear.

360
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:30,155
{\an8}[block tapping]

361
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:35,953
{\an8}I cannot even get past the logo,
so you're close.

362
00:16:36,537 --> 00:16:38,580
But I get it.
You need time and money,

363
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:40,958
and I know I was against this originally,

364
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:44,003
but... maybe you can still sell it
to Rebel.

365
00:16:44,461 --> 00:16:45,629
No, I would never do that.

366
00:16:45,713 --> 00:16:47,006
Thank God. [laughs]

367
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:50,467
Because she's just using you
for the software. [laughs]

368
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:53,053
But I'm not getting in the middle.
I'm just agreeing with you.

369
00:16:53,137 --> 00:16:54,847
Don't even need to know your reasons.

370
00:16:55,639 --> 00:16:57,599
[clicks tongue] But why?
Just out of curiosity.

371
00:16:57,683 --> 00:16:59,601
Why can't you sell Fakeblock to Rebel?

372
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:02,396
And just-- just consider it a-- a question
from an outsider.

373
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:05,024
[George Michael] Because she dumped me.

374
00:17:05,816 --> 00:17:07,484
You're not just trying
to please me by saying this?

375
00:17:07,568 --> 00:17:09,945
[George Michael]
And I wish I could give her the software

376
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:10,988
to get her back, but...

377
00:17:14,158 --> 00:17:15,284
it's-- it's fake.

378
00:17:16,285 --> 00:17:18,078
I knew it. I knew it.

379
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:19,955
She's not over me?

380
00:17:20,497 --> 00:17:23,167
No, Fakeblock. [sighs] It's fake.

381
00:17:25,502 --> 00:17:28,005
There is no privacy software.
I made the whole thing up.

382
00:17:29,006 --> 00:17:31,133
Made it up?
You told me a lie because you...

383
00:17:31,633 --> 00:17:34,636
I lied to you because you seemed
so proud of me, and then...

384
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:37,264
my lying just got me
in deeper and deeper,

385
00:17:37,347 --> 00:17:38,724
and then you bought the company,

386
00:17:38,807 --> 00:17:40,851
and I had to fire you
so you wouldn't get in trouble,

387
00:17:40,934 --> 00:17:43,854
and now the whole family is in trouble,
and I have no idea how to solve it.

388
00:17:44,188 --> 00:17:45,731
[sighs] I'm sorry, Dad.

389
00:17:45,814 --> 00:17:46,815
Are you mad?

390
00:17:47,149 --> 00:17:48,901
Uh, no.

391
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:52,821
Uh-uh. I'm not... I'm not mad.
I, uh... I get it.

392
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:54,031
You had your reasons.

393
00:17:54,615 --> 00:17:59,828
Um, I-- I do wish that I had not removed
all of my privacy software

394
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:02,915
and replaced it with Fakeblock,
but on the other hand,

395
00:18:02,998 --> 00:18:05,292
it does explain why Pemender
from Kuala Lumpur

396
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:06,752
keeps signing into my LinkedIn.

397
00:18:07,628 --> 00:18:08,921
[chuckles]

398
00:18:09,004 --> 00:18:10,214
[both chuckle]

399
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:12,466
The Chinese are gonna kill us.

400
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,885
-I'll get us out of it.
-Please don't.

401
00:18:15,803 --> 00:18:18,180
[Ron] <i>And back at the trial,</i>
<i>without Tobias,</i>

402
00:18:18,263 --> 00:18:20,974
<i>Dusty was without a witness</i>
<i>for the night of the murder.</i>

403
00:18:21,058 --> 00:18:22,518
<i>But Lottie had found one.</i>

404
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:24,812
I call to the witness stand Gene Parmesan.

405
00:18:25,062 --> 00:18:26,146
[man] Gene Parmesan.

406
00:18:27,064 --> 00:18:28,148
Gene Parmesan?

407
00:18:29,274 --> 00:18:30,692
Doesn't seem like he's here.

408
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:32,653
That's impossible.
He's a private detective.

409
00:18:32,736 --> 00:18:33,570
He'd never be late.

410
00:18:34,655 --> 00:18:36,698
Well, has anyone checked under the...

411
00:18:38,325 --> 00:18:39,493
new bailiff?

412
00:18:40,077 --> 00:18:42,746
-Gene Parmesan.
-[shrieks] Gene!

413
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:44,123
[Gene] And I swear to tell the truth,

414
00:18:44,206 --> 00:18:47,167
-so help me God.
-That never gets old!

415
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:49,962
I'll tell you something else
that never gets old. Whoops.

416
00:18:50,045 --> 00:18:51,463
-I'm under oath.
-[laughter]

417
00:18:53,882 --> 00:18:55,968
-On the night of Cinco de Cuatro...
-[Gene] Yeah.

418
00:18:56,051 --> 00:18:58,428
...you were undercover,
working selling donkey punch.

419
00:18:58,512 --> 00:19:00,097
-Isn't that correct?
-[Gene] Definitely undercover.

420
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:02,182
I don't need two jobs. [chuckles]

421
00:19:02,266 --> 00:19:04,017
'Cause everything's going really good.

422
00:19:04,101 --> 00:19:05,644
What exactly is in a donkey punch?

423
00:19:05,727 --> 00:19:07,146
You know, mostly Kool-Aid.

424
00:19:07,229 --> 00:19:09,481
-So it's similar to juice, then?
-[Gene] It is.

425
00:19:10,399 --> 00:19:11,817
[Ron] <i>Lucille was concerned.</i>

426
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:14,486
<i>The DA appeared to have done</i>
<i>her homework on Buster</i>

427
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:18,949
<i>and his lack of restraint</i>
<i>under the influence of sugary juice.</i>

428
00:19:19,032 --> 00:19:21,326
<i>And she found herself resenting</i> <i>a man </i>

429
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:23,036
<i>-she'd once admired.</i>
-[Lottie] Your witness.

430
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,372
[Ron] <i>But Lottie stopped short</i>
<i>of making that point.</i>

431
00:19:25,455 --> 00:19:26,999
Do you want me to take it easy on him?

432
00:19:27,082 --> 00:19:29,209
Or give it to him hard?
I know he's a friend of yours.

433
00:19:29,293 --> 00:19:31,378
[scoffs] He's not my friend anymore.

434
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:33,505
Testifying against our family

435
00:19:33,589 --> 00:19:36,842
after all the times
I faked being surprised by him?

436
00:19:36,925 --> 00:19:39,219
[Ron] <i>So Dusty went</i>
<i>after the witness's credibility.</i>

437
00:19:39,553 --> 00:19:43,307
Mr. Parmesan,
you say you're a master of disguises.

438
00:19:44,266 --> 00:19:46,476
How many looks
are you capable of creating?

439
00:19:48,312 --> 00:19:49,605
[Stanley] You asking me?

440
00:19:50,939 --> 00:19:52,149
I'm the judge.

441
00:19:54,067 --> 00:19:55,360
I'm Gene Parmesan.

442
00:19:55,444 --> 00:19:57,821
-[shrieks]
-You say you had an undercover job,

443
00:19:57,905 --> 00:20:00,365
which means you must have left
the donkey punch stand.

444
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:01,658
Isn't that correct?

445
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:05,162
-Yes, it is.
<i>-</i>So you can't dispute my client's claim

446
00:20:05,412 --> 00:20:07,080
that he was dressed as the rock monster

447
00:20:07,164 --> 00:20:09,791
out on that floating barge
when the murder took place.

448
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:12,836
Allegedly. [clears throat]
Allegedly took place.

449
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:15,756
No, I did leave the donkey punch stand,

450
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:18,425
uh, right before the play began.

451
00:20:18,508 --> 00:20:21,261
Mm-hmm. So how can you be sure

452
00:20:21,345 --> 00:20:23,847
that Buster <i>didn't </i>change
into the rock suit...

453
00:20:24,473 --> 00:20:25,891
as we've claimed?

454
00:20:26,934 --> 00:20:28,143
'Cause it was me.

00:20:29,269 --> 00:20:31,146
[Ron] <i>After fighting with Lucille 2,</i>

456

<i>Buster </i>did <i>end up</i>

457
00:20:34,191 --> 00:20:35,651
It's punch, like the juice!

458
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:37,486
Oh, I need some juice.

Hey, what are you guys doing here?

474
00:21:09,851 --> 00:21:12,771
Well, our stay at the Spotted Palm

475
00:21:12,854 --> 00:21:16,275
came to a rather abrupt end
when "Bev" here...

476
00:21:16,358 --> 00:21:20,112
{\an8}decided to look at her cellular telephone
without holding it at arm's length

477
00:21:20,195 --> 00:21:21,530
and putting on her readers first.

478
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:24,324
-She blew our cover.
-[Murphybrown] Sorry, I keep forgetting

479
00:21:24,408 --> 00:21:26,118
{\an8}that acting is my passion.

480
00:21:26,535 --> 00:21:27,911
[DeBrie] It really ruined

481
00:21:27,995 --> 00:21:29,329
Annette's funeral,

482
00:21:29,413 --> 00:21:31,248
may she rest in peace.

483
00:21:31,707 --> 00:21:32,833
Maeby killed Annette?

484
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:34,835
Where did we land with that?

485
00:21:34,918 --> 00:21:36,420
Uh... gore-- she was gored.

486
00:21:36,503 --> 00:21:38,839
Yes. Gored in the running of the bulls.

487
00:21:38,922 --> 00:21:41,133
People were getting suspicious,
so it had to be somewhere

488
00:21:41,216 --> 00:21:42,551
where there wouldn't be a body.

489
00:21:42,676 --> 00:21:44,886
{\an8}Or where an animal took off
with the body so fast...

490
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:46,430
-That you couldn't get it back.
-Exactly.

491
00:21:46,513 --> 00:21:47,556
That was the idea.

492
00:21:47,639 --> 00:21:49,224
{\an8}-Yep. Yes. Yep, yep.
-[DeBrie] Yeah, yeah.

493
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:51,935
Good. Well, if you guys were thinking
about staying here...

494
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:54,521
[gasps] Oh, thank you so much.
I told you he would come through!

495
00:21:54,604 --> 00:21:57,024
We cannot move in soon enough
for you. [laughs]

496
00:21:57,107 --> 00:22:00,110
Some of our happiest days
as a family were spent here.

497
00:22:00,193 --> 00:22:01,862
{\an8}[George Michael] It's not
an abandoned office anymore,

498
00:22:01,945 --> 00:22:03,905
so there are people doing work...
out there.

499
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:08,452
Uh-huh. Well, if it's work you require,
I suppose we can act it off.

500
00:22:08,535 --> 00:22:10,829
-Yeah, that's going to be a problem.
-[Tobias] Well, surely,

501
00:22:10,912 --> 00:22:13,874
there must be some, uh,
in-house corporate training seminar

502
00:22:13,957 --> 00:22:16,835
we could do
or-- or a sexual harassment video.

503
00:22:16,918 --> 00:22:19,755
I mean, I'm no Harvey Weinstein,
but I'm sure I could produce one.

504
00:22:20,297 --> 00:22:22,591
And I knew him. Did I tell you that story

505
00:22:22,674 --> 00:22:25,010
when Mr. Weinstein killed my ficus
in the '80s?

506
00:22:25,218 --> 00:22:26,720
When he came over to audition me for--

507
00:22:26,803 --> 00:22:30,265
Yes. We all know DeBrie Bardeaux snagged
a private audition

508
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:31,767
with Harvey Weinstein.

509
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:34,644
Yeah, but I came on too strong,
so I didn't get the part.

510
00:22:34,728 --> 00:22:38,523
Yes, well, some of us weren't lucky enough
to even have an audition to blow.

511
00:22:38,607 --> 00:22:40,942
Gosh, I don't really know
if we need any acting right now.

512
00:22:41,568 --> 00:22:44,404
The stuff we're doing here,
it's more about preventing hacking,

513
00:22:44,488 --> 00:22:47,824
{\an8}-protecting privacy, and stuff like that.
-That's what I was trying to stop, too.

514
00:22:48,241 --> 00:22:50,994
Yes, Murphybrown here is a bit
of a computer whiz.

515
00:22:51,078 --> 00:22:51,995
-[chuckles]
-Mm...

516
00:22:52,537 --> 00:22:53,997
He's worked on cable boxes.

517
00:22:54,081 --> 00:22:55,916
[Murphybrown] Yeah, I actually coded,
like...

518
00:22:55,999 --> 00:22:59,378
{\an8}an extra layer beneath the firewall
to keep your data from being exposed.

519
00:22:59,669 --> 00:23:01,755
It's like a dam or, like, a-- a stopper,

520
00:23:01,838 --> 00:23:04,299
{\an8}or a barrier to stop people from--

521
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:06,176
-Like a block?
-[stammers] Okay. [laughs]

522
00:23:06,259 --> 00:23:08,011
Can we do this in English, Professor?

523
00:23:08,095 --> 00:23:11,390
[Murphybrown] Oh, s-sorry, sorry, my...
Sorry, my fine student.

524
00:23:11,473 --> 00:23:12,849
-[troupe laughs]
-I need a diagram.

525
00:23:12,933 --> 00:23:14,434
It makes no sense at all.

526
00:23:14,518 --> 00:23:16,937
But what he's basically saying is,

527
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:19,731
nobody wants to be naked
underneath their underwear.

528
00:23:19,815 --> 00:23:22,359
So, one adds an extra layer of protection.

529
00:23:22,442 --> 00:23:23,985
It doesn't have to be denim, per se,

530
00:23:24,069 --> 00:23:26,822
but everybody wants to hide their privates
from something.

531
00:23:26,905 --> 00:23:28,407
Not everybody.

532
00:23:29,199 --> 00:23:30,992
-Can you show me?
-[Tobias] Oh, sure.

533
00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:32,661
-[DeBrie] God, yeah.
-No, your program?

534
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,955
{\an8}The-- The code that you wrote?

535
00:23:35,956 --> 00:23:38,166
[Ron] <i>George Michael was as surprised</i>

536
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:42,421
<i>as the courtroom was about to be</i>
<i>when the DA introduced a witness</i>

537
00:23:42,504 --> 00:23:45,173
<i>who would turn the whole case upside down</i>

538
00:23:45,257 --> 00:23:47,092
<i>with a sense of the dramatic.</i>

539
00:23:48,176 --> 00:23:51,555
[Lottie] Okay. Now, Warden Gentles,
you recently paid a visit

540
00:23:51,638 --> 00:23:54,224
to the Hollywood motion picture
director Ron Howard

541
00:23:54,307 --> 00:23:56,226
with information about the Bluth family

542
00:23:56,309 --> 00:23:58,812
you thought was pertinent
to a project he was working on

543
00:23:58,895 --> 00:24:00,355
about the Bluth family.

544
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:02,566
-Isn't that correct?
-[Gentles] That is correct.

545
00:24:02,649 --> 00:24:04,776
-Oh, my God.
-[Lottie] This had to do with an incident

546
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:07,028
in Buster Bluth's past, correct?

547
00:24:07,112 --> 00:24:08,822
Yes. It is so.

548
00:24:08,905 --> 00:24:11,658
And how exactly did you acquire
this information?

549
00:24:11,908 --> 00:24:16,121
Well, if I may be eloquent,
straight from the horse's mouth.

550
00:24:16,204 --> 00:24:17,706
And who is the horse?

551
00:24:20,417 --> 00:24:21,543
Lucille Bluth,

552
00:24:22,419 --> 00:24:23,920
of course, of course.

553
00:24:24,629 --> 00:24:27,174
[Lottie] But all that information
on that case

554
00:24:27,257 --> 00:24:30,927
-had been sealed.
-[Gentles] Well, all seals can come loose

555
00:24:31,011 --> 00:24:31,970
with a little bit of...

556
00:24:32,679 --> 00:24:34,306
Gentles' pressuring.

557
00:24:35,474 --> 00:24:38,477
[Ron] <i>And Lucille herself had been</i>
<i>so loosened.</i>

558
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:42,647
{\an8}<i>Some months earlier,</i>
<i>Lucille had enticed Warden Gentles</i>

559
00:24:42,731 --> 00:24:44,566
{\an8}<i>to a private dinner in order</i>

560
00:24:44,649 --> 00:24:48,445
{\an8}<i>to get her son Buster released</i>
<i>for a Second of July parade.</i>

561
00:24:48,945 --> 00:24:51,740
{\an8}<i>And through the course</i>
<i>of a well-served meal,</i>

562
00:24:52,991 --> 00:24:55,911
{\an8}<i>and even more frequently served</i>
<i>bottles of wine,</i>

563
00:24:56,328 --> 00:25:00,582
{\an8}<i>Lucille rekindled a friendship</i>
<i>in order to ask for a favor.</i>

564
00:25:00,665 --> 00:25:03,001
{\an8}<i>But as the afternoon turned into evening,</i>

565
00:25:03,084 --> 00:25:05,420
{\an8}<i>intimate details issued forth</i>

566
00:25:05,504 --> 00:25:08,340
{\an8}<i>from a now-drunken Lucille's mouth.</i>

567
00:25:08,757 --> 00:25:10,509
{\an8}<i>Information extremely useful</i>

568
00:25:10,592 --> 00:25:14,137
{\an8}<i>to a warden with ambitions</i>
<i>of a screenwriting career,</i>

569
00:25:14,221 --> 00:25:17,140
{\an8}<i>who had heard</i>
<i>about an Imagine streaming series</i>

570
00:25:17,224 --> 00:25:19,601
{\an8}<i>about this exact family.</i>

571
00:25:19,976 --> 00:25:23,146
{\an8}<i>So, while Lucille got her son out</i>
<i>for a parade,</i>

572
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:25,857
{\an8}<i>Warden Gentles got a lot more.</i>

573
00:25:26,441 --> 00:25:29,110
{\an8}<i>In fact,</i>
<i>the only thing guarded that evening</i>

574
00:25:29,569 --> 00:25:32,113
{\an8}<i>was Warden Gentles' private trailer.</i>

575
00:25:32,989 --> 00:25:35,575
[Lottie] And you shared these stories
with Ron Howard?

576
00:25:35,659 --> 00:25:37,369
-[Ron] <i>He did. </i>
-I did.

577
00:25:38,078 --> 00:25:41,248
Exhibit 3-A, <i>Making of a Monster.</i>

578
00:25:41,998 --> 00:25:45,210
I would like to play a clip
of the season finale.

579
00:25:45,961 --> 00:25:46,878
[TV beeps]

580
00:25:46,962 --> 00:25:50,924
{\an8}[Ron] <i>And so, they played much</i>
<i>of the Imagine Bluth project.</i>

581
00:25:51,007 --> 00:25:52,926
{\an8}<i>Now, remember, this is really rough.</i>

582
00:25:53,009 --> 00:25:56,221
{\an8}<i>And our location guy was only able</i>
<i>to rent out the cottage</i> <i>for shooting</i>

583
00:25:56,304 --> 00:25:58,765
{\an8}<i>for, like, two days.</i>
<i>And it's all temp sound.</i>

584
00:25:58,848 --> 00:26:02,811
{\an8}<i>-We haven't licensed most of this music.</i>
-What? What do you think you're doing?

585
00:26:03,144 --> 00:26:05,730
{\an8}I told you. I'm taking this girl who,
in my opinion,

586
00:26:05,814 --> 00:26:07,440
{\an8}has been mistreated by you
for far too long

587
00:26:07,524 --> 00:26:09,609
{\an8}on a cruise with her grandmother.

588
00:26:09,693 --> 00:26:11,528
{\an8}[scoffs] You're not taking her anywhere.

589
00:26:12,153 --> 00:26:13,572
{\an8}Oh, come on, Mom.

590
00:26:13,905 --> 00:26:15,699
{\an8}I <i>am </i>almost 14,

591
00:26:15,782 --> 00:26:18,702
{\an8}-and you <i>have </i>been mistreating me.
-[young Lucille] Oh...

592
00:26:19,327 --> 00:26:20,579
{\an8}You go to your room.

593
00:26:22,998 --> 00:26:24,749
{\an8}-[door closes]
-[young Lucille] How dare you?

594
00:26:24,833 --> 00:26:27,294
{\an8}We both know that child
is about to turn 18.

595
00:26:27,377 --> 00:26:29,963
{\an8}-Oh, that's right, it slipped my mind.
-[young Lucille] Oh, please.

596
00:26:30,046 --> 00:26:33,008
{\an8}That's all you've been thinking about
since you put her up for adoption.

597
00:26:33,091 --> 00:26:34,884
{\an8}[Mimi] <i>It hasn't been on your mind?</i>

598
00:26:36,428 --> 00:26:38,555
{\an8}You swooped in and stole her
from the Standwells

599
00:26:38,638 --> 00:26:39,931
{\an8}when you found out about the endowment,

600
00:26:40,015 --> 00:26:43,184
{\an8}'cause you just had to have
a cottage on the beach.

601
00:26:43,476 --> 00:26:44,311
{\an8}[scoffs]

602
00:26:44,394 --> 00:26:46,104
{\an8}[Mimi] You can say goodbye to that, honey.

603
00:26:46,396 --> 00:26:47,606
{\an8}Because that child is mine,

604
00:26:47,689 --> 00:26:49,899
{\an8}and I have nothing else
in my life right now.

605
00:26:49,983 --> 00:26:51,526
{\an8}<i>And I'm not gonna spend</i>
<i>the rest of it singing</i>

606
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:53,445
{\an8}<i>on a cruise ship for snifter tips.</i>

607
00:26:53,862 --> 00:26:55,447
{\an8}[young Lucille] <i>I knew this is</i>
<i>what you were up to.</i>

608
00:26:55,530 --> 00:26:57,240
{\an8}Suddenly, there's no gentleman caller
in the picture,

609
00:26:57,324 --> 00:26:59,117
{\an8}and you decide to look out for yourself?

610
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,536
{\an8}[Mimi] Oh, you're one to talk
about looking out for yourself.

611
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:04,164
{\an8}I've never been invited
to this place even once,

612
00:27:04,247 --> 00:27:05,749
{\an8}and let's not forget who paid for it.

613
00:27:06,583 --> 00:27:08,752
{\an8}[young Lucille] And this is how
you want to be paid back?

614
00:27:08,835 --> 00:27:11,713
{\an8}You think you're gonna walk
in here and take away my child?

615
00:27:11,796 --> 00:27:14,174
{\an8}That's not your child.
That's my child, and we both know it.

616
00:27:15,133 --> 00:27:15,967
{\an8}[young Buster] No.

617
00:27:16,217 --> 00:27:19,679
{\an8}It's not true. I still have it!
I'll still wear my gentleman's collar!

618
00:27:19,763 --> 00:27:22,432
{\an8}But you're not my mother.
Mother's my mother, Grandmother!

619
00:27:22,515 --> 00:27:23,892
{\an8}[screaming]

620
00:27:23,975 --> 00:27:25,810
{\an8}-[slow piano music playing]
-[thudding]

621
00:27:28,563 --> 00:27:30,523
{\an8}[Ron] <i>You know, it's funny,</i>
<i>I was actually worried</i>

622
00:27:30,607 --> 00:27:33,610
{\an8}<i>about them showing this in court,</i>
<i>but it-- it turned out better</i>

623
00:27:33,693 --> 00:27:34,944
{\an8}<i>than I'd remembered.</i>

624
00:27:35,445 --> 00:27:37,364
{\an8}<i>And I actually think</i>
<i>it's a good advertisement</i>

625
00:27:37,447 --> 00:27:38,490
{\an8}<i>for the show.</i>

626
00:27:39,115 --> 00:27:41,409
{\an8}<i>Of course,</i>
<i>we still haven't gotten Brian's notes.</i>

627
00:27:41,493 --> 00:27:43,828
{\an8}<i>And obviously,</i>
<i>we're gonna put Jean Smart's face</i>

628
00:27:43,912 --> 00:27:46,539
{\an8}<i>-on the stuntman.</i>
-[crashing echoes]

629
00:27:51,086 --> 00:27:53,046
{\an8}[Ron] <i>And Cobie did a great job, too.</i>

630
00:27:53,129 --> 00:27:54,881
<i>You know,</i>
<i>I-- I should send her something.</i>

631
00:27:55,465 --> 00:27:57,509
-Did you know about this?
-[Dusty] No.

632
00:27:57,592 --> 00:28:00,553
My dad made us give up Netflix
when they went up by two dollars.

633
00:28:00,637 --> 00:28:02,639
[Lottie] Is that an accurate depiction

634
00:28:02,722 --> 00:28:05,100
of what Lucille told you was a true story?

635
00:28:05,475 --> 00:28:08,436
I'm not just saying this
to suck up to Ron Howard,

636
00:28:09,062 --> 00:28:11,064
but I think we nailed it.

637
00:28:11,564 --> 00:28:13,692
[Lottie] So, Buster Bluth

638
00:28:13,775 --> 00:28:16,611
has killed before in the exact same manner

639
00:28:16,736 --> 00:28:18,446
he killed Lucille Austero!

640
00:28:18,822 --> 00:28:19,698
[man] Wow.

641
00:28:19,864 --> 00:28:21,324
[quietly] Prosecution rests.

642
00:28:21,866 --> 00:28:23,368
We will reconvene tomorrow.

643
00:28:23,451 --> 00:28:25,870
-Mistrial! Mistrial!
-Yes, yes!

644
00:28:25,954 --> 00:28:27,247
I missed your trial!

645
00:28:28,081 --> 00:28:30,250
So you sell me out to Warden Gentles?

646
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:33,294
And we both know you said
I wouldn't get in trouble.

647
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:36,297
-You made a promise!
-No, Buster, it was a mistake!

648
00:28:36,381 --> 00:28:39,134
You can live with her, Dusty.
