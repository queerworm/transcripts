OF A WEALTHY FAMILY

00:00:04,545 --> 00:00:05,755
WHO LOST EVERYTHING,

3
00:00:05,755 --> 00:00:07,007
AND THE ONE SON 
WHO HAD NO CHOICE

4
00:00:07,007 --> 00:00:08,383
BUT TO KEEP THEM ALL TOGETHER.

5
00:00:13,721 --> 00:00:16,057
IT'S "ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT."

6
00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:20,061
MICHAEL WAS SURPRISED 
TO FIND THE HOUSE

7
00:00:20,061 --> 00:00:22,313
STILL A MESS A WEEK 
AFTER THE FUMIGATION.

8
00:00:22,313 --> 00:00:24,857
- SO YOU STILL HAVEN'T PUT 
THIS STUFF BACK YET, HUH?

9
00:00:24,857 --> 00:00:27,777
YOU'VE GOT TO BE 
THE LAZIEST PERSON IN THE WORLD.

10
00:00:27,777 --> 00:00:29,945
- IF YOU WEREN'T ALL THE WAY 
ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ROOM,

11
00:00:29,945 --> 00:00:30,946
I'D SLAP YOUR FACE.

12
00:00:30,946 --> 00:00:32,573
- I ASKED YOU TO CLEAN THIS UP.

13
00:00:32,573 --> 00:00:34,617
- YEAH, AND YOU ALSO ASKED ME 
TO CALL THE FUMIGATORS,

14
00:00:34,617 --> 00:00:36,786
AND YOU HAVEN'T EVEN THANKED ME 
FOR DOING THAT.

15
00:00:36,786 --> 00:00:38,454
narrator: MICHAEL HAD ASKED HER 
TO DO THIS,

16
00:00:38,454 --> 00:00:40,040
BUT THAT WAS LONG BEFORE

17
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:43,251
HE BEGAN HIDING HIS FUGITIVE 
FATHER IN THE ATTIC.

18
00:00:43,251 --> 00:00:46,712
- WHAT? UH--OH, GOD.

19
00:00:46,712 --> 00:00:48,673
POLLY, COVER YOUR MOUTH.

20
00:00:48,673 --> 00:00:50,466
thunk!

21
00:00:50,466 --> 00:00:53,886
narrator: LUCKILY, MICHAEL 
WAS NOTIFIED IN TIME.

22
00:00:53,886 --> 00:00:55,596
- WELL, WE HAD A DEAL, YOU KNOW.

23
00:00:55,596 --> 00:00:57,432
I'D PAY FOR EVERYTHING, 
AND YOU'D CLEAN THE HOUSE.

24
00:00:57,432 --> 00:00:58,974
AND YOU'VE ONLY DONE IT ONCE.

25
00:00:58,974 --> 00:01:00,560
narrator: SHE HADN'T 
EVEN DONE IT THAT TIME,

26
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:02,770
BUT INSTEAD, INTERCEPTED 
HER MOTHER'S HOUSEKEEPER

27
00:01:02,770 --> 00:01:04,230
AS SHE WAS ARRIVING FOR WORK.

28
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:06,316
- CAN I TAKE YOU 
THE REST OF THE WAY?

29
00:01:06,316 --> 00:01:07,858
- MRS.-- MRS.--

30
00:01:07,858 --> 00:01:10,445
- OH, I HAVE TO MAKE 
ONE QUICK STOP FIRST.

31
00:01:10,445 --> 00:01:13,114
- ALMOST DONE.

32
00:01:13,114 --> 00:01:15,575
YOURS OR MISTER'S?

33
00:01:15,575 --> 00:01:17,327
- MISTER'S.

34
00:01:17,327 --> 00:01:20,121
narrator: LUPE NEVER ACCEPTED 
A RIDE FROM LINDSAY AGAIN.

35
00:01:20,121 --> 00:01:21,997
- WELL, I'M SORRY, MICHAEL,

36
00:01:21,997 --> 00:01:24,292
BUT TOBIAS MOVING OUT 
HASN'T BEEN EASY.

37
00:01:24,292 --> 00:01:26,419
- FOR ANY OF US.

38
00:01:26,419 --> 00:01:28,796
- YOU DIDN'T EVEN NOTICE 
HE'D GONE, DID YOU?

39
00:01:28,796 --> 00:01:30,131
- I DID NOTICE 
WE'D STOPPED TIVOING

40
00:01:30,131 --> 00:01:31,382
"THE CHRISTOPHER LOWELL SHOW."

41
00:01:31,382 --> 00:01:32,633
WHAT HAPPENED?

42
00:01:32,633 --> 00:01:35,220
- I TRIED TO GIVE IT 
ONE LAST CHANCE.

43
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:36,512
LIKE WHAT YOU SEE?

44
00:01:36,512 --> 00:01:38,013
- I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR THOSE.

45
00:01:38,013 --> 00:01:39,349
YOU'RE GONNA 
STRETCH THEM OUT.

46
00:01:39,349 --> 00:01:41,100
- THAT'S ALL YOU CAN SAY?

47
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:43,203
- WELL, EXCUSE ME FOR LIKING 
THE WAY THEY SHAPE MY JUNK.

48
00:01:43,203 --> 00:01:46,189
- I DON'T KNOW WHY, 
BUT THAT'S IT.

49
00:01:46,189 --> 00:01:50,235
YOU CAN PACK YOUR JUNK 
AND GET OUT.

50
00:01:50,235 --> 00:01:51,444
- YOU'RE KICKING ME OUT?

51
00:01:51,444 --> 00:01:53,321
AT THE BEGINNING 
OF PILOT SEASON?

52
00:01:53,321 --> 00:01:55,365
- YOU'RE NOT GONNA MAKE IT 
AS AN ACTOR,

53
00:01:55,365 --> 00:01:57,158
AND WE'RE NOT 
GONNA MAKE IT AS A COUPLE.

54
00:01:57,158 --> 00:01:59,994
narrator: WITH NOWHERE TO GO, 
TOBIAS WENT TO THE STUDIO

55
00:01:59,994 --> 00:02:02,497
WHERE HE'D OCCASIONALLY WORKED 
AS A SECURITY GUARD

56
00:02:02,497 --> 00:02:04,165
AND TOOK UP RESIDENCE

57
00:02:04,165 --> 00:02:06,584
IN THE APARTMENT OF DETECTIVE 
FRANK WRENCH,

58
00:02:06,584 --> 00:02:08,711
ON THE SET 
OF THE TELEVISION SHOW,

59
00:02:08,711 --> 00:02:10,630
"WRENCH."

60
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:12,173
- I'M REALLY SORRY TO HEAR THAT.

61
00:02:12,173 --> 00:02:13,633
HOW'S MAEBY TAKING IT?

62
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:16,136
- WELL, SHE'S REALLY HARD 
TO READ.

63
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:18,053
- YOU HAVEN'T TOLD HER YET.

64
00:02:18,053 --> 00:02:20,097
- WELL, SHE WAS SO EXCITED 
THE HOT WATER IN THE SHOWER

65
00:02:20,097 --> 00:02:21,891
WAS LASTING LONGER, 
HOW COULD I HAVE THE HEART

66
00:02:21,891 --> 00:02:23,684
TO TELL HER IT'S BECAUSE 
HER FATHER MOVED OUT?

67
00:02:23,684 --> 00:02:26,187
- TOBIAS MOVED OUT?

68
00:02:26,187 --> 00:02:28,689
DID HE TAKE THE GOOD 
VIDEO CAMERA WITH HIM?

69
00:02:28,689 --> 00:02:30,233
- THAT'S REALLY VERY TOUCHING, 
GOB.

70
00:02:30,233 --> 00:02:31,484
WHAT DO YOU NEED 
THE CAMERA FOR?

71
00:02:31,484 --> 00:02:33,278
- I'M MAKING A MAGIC VIDEO.

72
00:02:33,278 --> 00:02:35,530
I'M GONNA TAPE MYSELF 
DOING TRICKS AROUND THE OFFICE.

73
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:37,490
I'M CALLING IT "TRICKS"--

74
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:40,410
LET ME FINISH-- 
"AROUND THE OFFICE."

75
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:42,995
I FIGURED OUT A WAY TO 
MAKE MONEY WHILE I'M WORKING.

76
00:02:42,995 --> 00:02:44,830
- THAT IS WHAT WE CALL WORKING.

77
00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:47,167
SOMETHING YOU MIGHT WANT TO TRY 
NEXT TIME YOU'RE AT THE OFFICE.

78
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:48,584
YOU'VE BEEN MISSING THINGS 
LATELY.

79
00:02:48,584 --> 00:02:50,085
I'M GETTIN' REAL TIRED 
OF IT.

80
00:02:50,085 --> 00:02:51,754
INCIDENTALLY, TODAY WE'RE HAVING 
A BIG VOTE

81
00:02:51,754 --> 00:02:53,172
ON THAT BUILDING RENOVATION.

82
00:02:53,172 --> 00:02:54,715
I NEED YOU THERE 
TO HELP ME VOTE IT IN.

83
00:02:54,715 --> 00:02:56,342
- FINE. I'LL VOTE 
AT YOUR STUPID MEETING,

84
00:02:56,342 --> 00:02:58,052
AS LONG AS 
YOU GIVE ME THE CAMERA.

85
00:02:58,052 --> 00:03:00,763
I THINK WE ALL KNOW THAT GEORGE 
MICHAEL WAS USING IT LAST.

86
00:03:00,763 --> 00:03:02,598
narrator: A FACT THE FAMILY 
HAD DISCOVERED

87
00:03:02,598 --> 00:03:04,684
WHEN THEY'D GATHERED 
TO WATCH A HOME VIDEO.

88
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:06,852
- WAS THAT 
A 40th ANNIVERSARY PARTY, HUH?

89
00:03:06,852 --> 00:03:08,354
DIDN'T COST US A THING.

90
00:03:08,354 --> 00:03:10,898
- IS THAT QUSAY HUSSEIN 
AT THE OMELET BAR?

91
00:03:10,898 --> 00:03:14,068
- LOOK AT THIS. IF THESE GUYS 
MOVE, THEY DON'T GET PAID.

92
00:03:16,237 --> 00:03:17,947
narrator: IT SEEMS 
THAT AS A 13-YEAR-OLD,

93
00:03:17,947 --> 00:03:19,615
GEORGE MICHAEL HAD BEEN

94
00:03:19,615 --> 00:03:21,701
HEAVILY INFLUENCED 
BY THE STAR WARS FILMS

95
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:23,953
AND HAD ENDEAVORED TO 
RE-CREATE HIS FAVORITE MOMENTS.

96
00:03:23,953 --> 00:03:26,706
- YOU'RE NOT MY FATHER! 
YOU'LL NEVER BE!

97
00:03:26,706 --> 00:03:28,916
- I SPENT $2.1 MILLION

98
00:03:28,916 --> 00:03:31,419
OF GOOD COMPANY MONEY 
AND END UP WITH THIS?

99
00:03:31,419 --> 00:03:32,420
- YOU CUT OFF MY HAND!

100
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:33,879
- WORTH EVERY PENNY.

101
00:03:33,879 --> 00:03:35,465
EVEN YOU HAVE TO ADMIT

102
00:03:35,465 --> 00:03:37,300
THAT THAT WAS THE LAMEST THING 
EVER PUT ON TAPE.

103
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:39,009
narrator: NOT SO.

104
00:03:39,009 --> 00:03:41,471
BUSTER HAD ONCE VIDEOTAPED 
HIMSELF RE-CREATING MOMENTS

105
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:44,432
FROM HIS 
THEN FAVORITE FILM, "CHICAGO."

106
00:03:44,432 --> 00:03:46,976
- [trilling]

107
00:03:46,976 --> 00:03:48,519
narrator: 
HE ALSO LIKED STAR WARS.

108
00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:51,272
- HOO-AH!

109
00:03:51,272 --> 00:03:53,107
- HIS SELF-ESTEEM IS LOW ENOUGH 
AS IT IS,

110
00:03:53,107 --> 00:03:54,817
AND I HAVE NO IDEA WHY.

111
00:03:54,817 --> 00:03:56,986
- I MEAN, HE'S SUCH A GREAT KID, 
AND EVERYBODY LOVES HIM.

112
00:03:56,986 --> 00:03:58,988
HE'S GEORGE MICHAEL.

113
00:03:58,988 --> 00:04:00,865
TRUTHFULLY, THAT'S WHY I'M 
NOT THAT CRAZY ABOUT THAT ANN,

114
00:04:00,865 --> 00:04:02,867
BUT HE'LL MOVE ON.

115
00:04:02,867 --> 00:04:05,119
- UNLESS HE KNOCKS HER UP 
LIKE YOU DID WITH HIS MOTHER.

116
00:04:05,119 --> 00:04:06,954
PLUS, SHE'S RELIGIOUS.

117
00:04:06,954 --> 00:04:09,499
IF THAT ONE GETS PREGNANT, 
IT STAYS PREGNANT.

118
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:14,254
BELIEVE ME. I DATED A CHICK LIKE 
THAT ONCE IN HIGH SCHOOL.

119
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:16,881
NO, I DIDN'T.

120
00:04:16,881 --> 00:04:19,550
- I GOT TO WORK 
ON THAT BOY'S SELF-ESTEEM.

121
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:21,427
narrator: MICHAEL WENT TO DO SO,

122
00:04:21,427 --> 00:04:23,304
ONLY TO HEAR ANN 
BEATING HIM TO IT.

123
00:04:23,304 --> 00:04:25,306
- I WANT YOU TO DO IT. 
- I DON'T THINK I'M READY.

124
00:04:25,306 --> 00:04:26,641
- OF COURSE YOU ARE.

125
00:04:26,641 --> 00:04:28,142
- I'M GONNA LOSE IT 
BEFORE I START.

126
00:04:28,142 --> 00:04:30,436
- DON'T START!

127
00:04:30,436 --> 00:04:31,646
SMOKING.

128
00:04:31,646 --> 00:04:33,273
IT'S A KILLER.

129
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:35,149
THAT SAMMY DAVIS, JR. 
SHOULD STILL BE PERFORMING.

130
00:04:35,149 --> 00:04:36,859
WHAT'S GOING ON?

131
00:04:36,859 --> 00:04:38,944
- ANN THINKS I SHOULD RUN 
FOR STUDENT BODY PRESIDENT.

132
00:04:38,944 --> 00:04:40,946
- THAT IS A GREAT IDEA. 
- WELL, I DON'T HAVE A CHANCE.

133
00:04:40,946 --> 00:04:42,365
I MEAN, THEY ONLY VOTE 
FOR THE COOL KIDS.

134
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:44,033
- BUT EVERYONE LOVES YOU.

135
00:04:44,033 --> 00:04:45,910
- YOU ARE GEORGE MICHAEL. 
WHO'S COOLER THAN YOU?

136
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:47,787
["Star Wars Main Theme"]

137
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:50,540
PLUS, YOU WOULD BE FOLLOWING 
IN YOUR OLD MAN'S FOOTSTEPS.

138
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:51,916
- YOU WERE STUDENT BODY 
PRESIDENT?

139
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:54,460
- OH-HO. IT WAS CLOSE.

140
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:55,836
- SO YOU LOST?

141
00:04:55,836 --> 00:04:57,505
- WHO REMEMBERS? 
- I KNOW I WOULD REMEMBER.

142
00:04:57,505 --> 00:04:59,214
- ANN, IF MY DAD SAYS 
THAT HE WON, THEN HE WON.

143
00:04:59,214 --> 00:05:01,258
- DIDN'T SAY I WON. 
SAID I CAN'T REMEMBER.

144
00:05:01,258 --> 00:05:02,885
BUT NOW THAT WE'RE THINKING 
ABOUT IT,

145
00:05:02,885 --> 00:05:05,405
I SEEM TO REMEMBER THE OTHER GUY 
WON THE ACTUAL TITLE,

146
00:05:05,405 --> 00:05:08,015
ALTHOUGH THERE WERE PLENTY 
IN THE SCHOOL

147
00:05:08,015 --> 00:05:09,475
WHO WANTED 
TO OVERTURN THE DECISION.

148
00:05:09,475 --> 00:05:11,477
I SAID, "LET'S--DO NOT--

149
00:05:11,477 --> 00:05:13,563
LET'S NOT PUT THE SCHOOL 
THROUGH THAT."

150
00:05:13,563 --> 00:05:16,441
HAVEN'T THOUGHT ABOUT THAT 
FOR YEARS. GOOD MEMORY.

151
00:05:16,441 --> 00:05:18,734
- WELL, ANYWAY, I'LL HELP YOU 
RUN YOUR CAMPAIGN

152
00:05:18,734 --> 00:05:20,528
AND MAKE YOUR COMMERCIAL 
FOR ELECTION DAY.

153
00:05:20,528 --> 00:05:22,154
- WELL, THAT'S GREAT.

154
00:05:22,154 --> 00:05:24,782
THE IMPORTANT THING IS 
TO RAISE THE OLD SELF-ESTEEM

155
00:05:24,782 --> 00:05:29,036
AND NOT TO RUSH 
A PHYSICAL RELATIONSHIP.

156
00:05:29,036 --> 00:05:30,746
THOSE ARE REALLY 
THE TWO IMPORTANT THINGS.

157
00:05:30,746 --> 00:05:32,665
- OH, NO. WE'RE BOTH WAITING. 
- GOOD.

158
00:05:32,665 --> 00:05:35,876
- AND THEN THAT FIRST TIME, 
AFTER WAITING AND WAITING,

159
00:05:35,876 --> 00:05:37,920
IT'S GONNA BE SO AWESOME,

160
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:40,339
BECAUSE IT'S NOT JUST GONNA BE 
MY LOVE AND GEORGE MICHAEL'S,

161
00:05:40,339 --> 00:05:42,758
BUT GOD'S LOVE AS WELL.

162
00:05:42,758 --> 00:05:44,051
GOD, IT'S GONNA BE INCREDIBLE.

163
00:05:44,051 --> 00:05:46,178
- ALL RIGHT. I'LL DO IT. 
I'M IN.

164
00:05:46,178 --> 00:05:47,888
- CAMPAIGN? 
- I'M PUMPED.

165
00:05:47,888 --> 00:05:49,306
narrator: AS GEORGE MICHAEL

166
00:05:49,306 --> 00:05:51,058
WAS ON THE PATH 
TO HIGHER SELF-ESTEEM,

167
00:05:51,058 --> 00:05:54,061
BUSTER WAS LOSING 
WHAT LITTLE HE HAD.

168
00:05:54,061 --> 00:05:56,355
- I CAN'T PUT THE AORTA IN 
WITH THIS THING.

169
00:05:56,355 --> 00:05:59,108
- OH, STOP COMPLAINING.

170
00:05:59,108 --> 00:06:00,693
- BUSTER!

171
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:03,904
- I'M SORRY I'M AN INCONVENIENCE 
TO YOU, MOTHER.

172
00:06:03,904 --> 00:06:08,659
OH, GOD! OH, GOD! 
OH!

FOR BUSTER'S LOSS OF A HAND,

175
00:06:13,748 --> 00:06:17,042
LINDSAY FELT SORRY 
FOR HER LOSS OF LUPE.

176
00:06:23,758 --> 00:06:30,347
[mystical Middle Eastern music]

177
00:06:30,347 --> 00:06:34,143
LINDSAY HAD CLEANED ONE ROOM 
AND NOW HAD A GARBAGE PROBLEM.

178
00:06:34,143 --> 00:06:37,062
AND WHILE LOOKING FOR A SPOT 
TO STASH THE REFUSE,

179
00:06:37,062 --> 00:06:39,064
SHE CAME UPON AN OLD FRIEND.

180
00:06:39,064 --> 00:06:41,859
- I HAVEN'T SEEN THIS 
IN AGES.

181
00:06:41,859 --> 00:06:43,611
EBAY.

WAS A NEW FRIEND TO GEORGE, SR.

183
00:06:46,781 --> 00:06:47,782
- POLLY.

184
00:06:47,782 --> 00:06:49,366

AND BACK AT THE OFFICE,

186
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:54,204
MICHAEL CAME TO REGRET HAVING 
GIVEN GOB THE VIDEO CAMERA.

187
00:06:54,204 --> 00:06:55,515
- WELL, I CERTAINLY 
APPRECIATE YOUR DECISION,

188
00:06:55,515 --> 00:06:58,000
BUT IF MY BROTHER WAS HERE,

189
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,544
WE COULD'VE VOTED 
THIS THING THROUGH.

190
00:06:59,544 --> 00:07:03,213
- WHAT'S THIS? 
A STUFFY OFFICE MEETING?

191
00:07:03,213 --> 00:07:07,843
WELL, MAYBE IT'S TIME 
FOR A LITTLE OFFICE MAGIC.

192
00:07:07,843 --> 00:07:10,345
- WHAT'S "OFFICE MAGIC"?

193
00:07:10,345 --> 00:07:12,139
- SOMETIMES IT'S AS SIMPLE 
AS TURNING

194
00:07:12,139 --> 00:07:16,143
10:45 IN THE MORNING INTO...

195
00:07:16,143 --> 00:07:17,770
LUNCHTIME!

196
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:21,566
- WHY DOES LUNCH 
HAVE TO BE SO DULL?

197
00:07:21,566 --> 00:07:25,194
- MAYBE YOU'D 
PREFER SOME CHICKEN INSTEAD!

198
00:07:25,194 --> 00:07:28,280
- ALL RIGHT. LET'S CUT. 
TAKE FIVE, EVERYBODY.

199
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:30,658
- NO, NO. WE'RE NOT TAKIN' FIVE. 
HEY, IS THIS GUY WITH YOU?

200
00:07:30,658 --> 00:07:32,367
- YEAH, HE'S AN ACTOR, 
RON MICHAELSON.

201
00:07:32,367 --> 00:07:34,161
- WELL, YOU KNOW, 
I THOUGHT HE WAS AN INVESTOR.

202
00:07:34,161 --> 00:07:35,788
HE VOTED AGAINST ME,

203
00:07:35,788 --> 00:07:38,207
WHICH IS THE VOTE I ASKED YOU 
TO BE HERE FOR, SO--

204
00:07:38,207 --> 00:07:40,084
YOU KNOW WHAT? I DON'T KNOW WHY, 
BUT THAT'S IT.

205
00:07:40,084 --> 00:07:42,044
OKAY, I DON'T THINK 
I CAN WORK WITH YOU ANYMORE.

206
00:07:42,044 --> 00:07:44,004
- WELL, YOU KIND OF HAVE TO, 
GUY. I'M THE PRESIDENT.

207
00:07:44,004 --> 00:07:46,131
- NO. I'M THE PRESIDENT. 
- NO, YOU LOST THE PRESIDENCY.

208
00:07:46,131 --> 00:07:48,050
JUST LIKE YOU DID IN HIGH SCHOOL 
WHEN YOU REFUSED

209
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:50,094
TO PLAY DIRTY LIKE DAD 
TOLD YOU TO; WORKED WHEN I RAN.

210
00:07:50,094 --> 00:07:51,887

ABOUT THE OFFICE HERE, OKAY?

I DO ALL THE WORK. 
I'VE BEEN HELPING YOU.

212
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:54,765
BUT THAT'S OVER NOW.

213
00:07:54,765 --> 00:07:56,183
- SORRY TO HEAR YOU SAY THAT, 
MICHAEL,

214
00:07:56,183 --> 00:07:57,477
'CAUSE IT JUST 
COST YOU YOUR JOB.

215
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:58,894
- I'M SERIOUS. IT'S OVER.

216
00:07:58,894 --> 00:08:00,605
- HOW DO YOU CALL SECURITY 
ON THIS THING?

217
00:08:00,605 --> 00:08:02,565
- YOU HIT POUND-ZERO-ZERO 
TO OPERATE THE SYSTEM.

218
00:08:02,565 --> 00:08:03,774
- POUND IS TIC-TAC-TOE, RIGHT?

219
00:08:03,774 --> 00:08:05,359
- YEAH. POUND IS RIGHT--

220
00:08:05,359 --> 00:08:07,069
- WHEN I KEEP HITTING THAT, 
THE OTHER THING FLASHES.

221
00:08:07,069 --> 00:08:08,821
- HIT POUND AND THEN ZERO-ZERO. 
- I DO. I KNOW.

222
00:08:08,821 --> 00:08:10,823
- TELL YOU WHAT, YOU DON'T NEED 
TO LEARN THE SYSTEM,

223
00:08:10,823 --> 00:08:11,866
BECAUSE YOU'RE OUT OF HERE.

224
00:08:11,866 --> 00:08:14,076

225
00:08:14,076 --> 00:08:16,370
HAVE SECURITY SEND A MAN UP.

226
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:18,163
YOU'VE GOT THE WRONG GUY.

227
00:08:18,163 --> 00:08:21,751

BUT YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO THIS.

narrator: BUT THE GUARD 
HAD RECENTLY LOST HALF HIS TIE

229

YOU GETTING THIS?

232
00:08:28,549 --> 00:08:31,511

TO CHEAT OUT A LITTLE BIT.

233

- OH, HEY. 
- WHAT WAS THAT ALL ABOUT?

234
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:37,307
- YOUR UNCLE DOESN'T 
NOT WORK HERE ANYMORE.

235
00:08:37,307 --> 00:08:39,560
SO I GUESS YOUR MOM TOLD YOU 
ABOUT YOUR DAD MOVING OUT, HUH?

236
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:42,187
- NO, SHE DID NOT TELL ME THAT. 
- OH.

237
00:08:42,187 --> 00:08:43,606
- BUT SHE DOESN'T TELL ME 
ANYTHING.

238
00:08:43,606 --> 00:08:45,274
NEITHER OF THEM DO.

239
00:08:45,274 --> 00:08:47,192
- SORRY. GUESS I SHOULDN'T 
HAVE SAID ANYTHING.

240
00:08:47,192 --> 00:08:50,445
- MAYBE I SHOULD JUST START 
KEEPING SOME SECRETS OF MY OWN.

241
00:08:50,445 --> 00:08:52,948
- WHY AREN'T YOU AT SCHOOL 
RIGHT NOW?

242
00:08:52,948 --> 00:08:55,159
- MARRY ME.

243
00:08:55,159 --> 00:08:58,579
I'M SO SORRY. 
I FORGOT WHO I WAS TALKING TO.

244
00:08:58,579 --> 00:09:01,916
I WAS JUST USING YOUR COPIER 
TO MAKE SOME CAMPAIGN POSTERS.

245
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:04,794
- WELL, THEN, BY ALL MEANS, 
LET ME HELP YOU OUT.

246
00:09:04,794 --> 00:09:06,461
- I MEAN, I DON'T EVEN KNOW 
WHY I'M DOING IT.

247
00:09:06,461 --> 00:09:07,672
HE'S GONNA WIN BY A LANDSLIDE.

248
00:09:07,672 --> 00:09:08,923
- THAT'S WHAT I WAS TELLIN' HIM.

249
00:09:08,923 --> 00:09:10,299
- HOW DO YOU KNOW STEVE HOLT?

250
00:09:10,299 --> 00:09:11,676
ARE YOU IN A.A.?

251
00:09:11,676 --> 00:09:13,218

GEORGE MICHAEL.

252
00:09:13,218 --> 00:09:14,637
HE'S RUNNING 
FOR STUDENT BODY PRESIDENT.

253
00:09:14,637 --> 00:09:16,096
WHO'S STEVE HOLT?

254
00:09:16,096 --> 00:09:17,557
- HE'S JUST THE HOTTEST GUY 
IN SCHOOL.

255
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:18,933
AND HE'S WON 
THREE YEARS IN A ROW--

256
00:09:18,933 --> 00:09:20,685
EVERY YEAR 
AFTER HIS FIRST JUNIOR YEAR.

257
00:09:20,685 --> 00:09:22,978
- SO THEN HE'S MORE POPULAR 
THAN GEORGE MICHAEL?

258
00:09:22,978 --> 00:09:24,689
- WELL, THAT'S LIKE 
COMPARING APPLES

259
00:09:24,689 --> 00:09:26,941
AND SOME FRUIT 
NOBODY'S EVER HEARD OF.

260
00:09:26,941 --> 00:09:29,151
HE MIGHT EVEN FINISH 
AFTER THE INDIAN KID.

261
00:09:29,151 --> 00:09:30,653
- I GUESS I GOT TO GET DOWN 
TO THE SCHOOL

262
00:09:30,653 --> 00:09:32,655
AND SEE IF I CAN 
STOP HIM FROM SIGNING UP, HUH?

263
00:09:32,655 --> 00:09:33,906
- YES. YOU HAVE TO.

264
00:09:33,906 --> 00:09:35,658
AND DO YOU THINK YOU 
COULD PUT UP

265
00:09:35,658 --> 00:09:37,367
A COUPLE 
OF THESE WHEN YOU'RE THERE,

266
00:09:37,367 --> 00:09:40,913

00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:54,468
YOU'RE FIRED!

273
00:09:54,468 --> 00:09:55,761

I'M FIRING YOU!

275
00:09:56,762 --> 00:09:58,806
- I WAS FIRING LUPE!

276
00:09:58,806 --> 00:09:59,699
- WELL, THAT MAKES MORE SENSE.

277
00:10:04,228 --> 00:10:06,939
- LINDSAY CAME UPON LUPE, 
WHO'D JUST BEEN FIRED.

278
00:10:06,939 --> 00:10:10,776
- CAN'T YOU AT LEAST COME OVER 
AND DUSTBUSTER OR SOMETHING?

279
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:13,613
- I NO DOES BUSTER ANYMORE.

280
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:17,157

281
00:10:17,157 --> 00:10:18,575
GOD.

282
00:10:18,575 --> 00:10:20,745
- HELLO? 
- HEY. I CAN'T TALK LOUDLY.

283
00:10:20,745 --> 00:10:22,329
I'M IN THE BATHROOM 
OF THE WRENCH SET,

AND THEY'VE STARTED SHOOTING.

285
00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:28,168
ALSO, I DON'T THINK 
THIS IS A REAL TOILET.

00:11:26,643 --> 00:11:28,771
BUT AS A RESULT, I'M NO LONGER 
WELCOME IN THE OFFICE.

315
00:11:28,771 --> 00:11:31,606

I JUST FIRED MY HOUSEKEEPER.

00:12:00,719 --> 00:12:03,472
- I'M SORRY. 
I DIDN'T CALL ANY--

332
00:12:03,472 --> 00:12:05,933
- OH, ALLOW ME 
TO INTRODUCE MYSELF.

333
00:12:05,933 --> 00:12:08,727
MY NAME 
IS PHYLLIDIA FEATHERBOTTOM,

334
00:12:08,727 --> 00:12:11,105
AND I CAN COOK 
AND I CAN CLEAN

335
00:12:11,105 --> 00:12:13,774
AND I CAN 
TAKE CARE OF THE LITTLE ONES.

336
00:12:13,774 --> 00:12:18,070
I CAN ALSO SING A SONG OR TWO, 
IF IT COMES IN HANDY.

337
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:22,825
[singing] WHEN YOU PUT A SQUIRT 
OF FROSTING DOWN YOUR THROAT

338
00:12:22,825 --> 00:12:25,244
BEFORE WE TAKE 
OUR MEDICATIONS

339
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:26,871
narrator: 
TOBIAS HAD GAINED ACCESS

340
00:12:26,871 --> 00:12:29,581
TO THE STUDIO'S WARDROBE 
AND MAKEUP DEPARTMENT.

341
00:12:29,581 --> 00:12:31,917
HE WAS EAGER 
TO BOTH SEE HIS DAUGHTER

342
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:33,418
AND PROVE TO HIS WIFE

343
00:12:33,418 --> 00:12:35,379
THAT HE HAD WHAT IT TOOK 
TO BE AN ACTOR.

344
00:12:35,379 --> 00:12:39,133
IT WAS THE EXACT PLOT 
OF THE FILM "MRS. DOUBTFIRE."

345
00:12:39,133 --> 00:12:41,468
- [singing] 
IN THE MOST DELICIOUS WAY

346
00:12:41,468 --> 00:12:43,637
narrator: THERE WAS ALSO 
SOME "MARY POPPINS" IN THERE.

347
00:12:43,637 --> 00:12:45,597
- LET'S GET THIS 
HOUSE CLEANED UP.

348
00:12:45,597 --> 00:12:48,475
- HEY. LINDSAY, 
THE PLACE LOOKS FANTASTIC.

349
00:12:48,475 --> 00:12:50,144
WHAT? DID YOU PAY SOMEBODY 
TO DO THIS?

350
00:12:50,144 --> 00:12:53,939
- OH, I'VE NO NEED FOR PAYMENT.

351
00:12:53,939 --> 00:12:56,691
THE LOVE OF THE FAMILY 
IS MORE THAN ENOUGH.

352
00:12:56,691 --> 00:12:58,878
- I'M SORRY. 
THIS IS MRS. FEATHERBOTTOM.

353
00:12:58,878 --> 00:13:02,739
- FROM BLACKSTOOL. 
I'M CHARMED, I'M SURE.

354
00:13:02,739 --> 00:13:04,241
OOH!

355
00:13:04,241 --> 00:13:06,118
[giggling]

356
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:08,620
BACK TO WORK.

357
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:10,330
- I THINK HE MISSES 
HIS DAUGHTER.

358
00:13:10,330 --> 00:13:11,832
- THAT'S CONVENIENT,

359
00:13:11,832 --> 00:13:13,542
CONSIDERING YOU DIDN'T EVEN 
HAVE THE COURAGE

360
00:13:13,542 --> 00:13:15,377
TO TELL MAEBY 
THAT HE'D MOVED OUT.

361
00:13:15,377 --> 00:13:17,254
- I'M SORRY. I'M NOT 
THE PERFECT PARENT, LIKE YOU.

362
00:13:17,254 --> 00:13:18,755
- I'M NOT THAT PERFECT.

363
00:13:18,755 --> 00:13:21,050
I PUSHED GEORGE MICHAEL 
INTO RUNNING FOR OFFICE,

364
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:23,552
AND I THINK HE'S GONNA GET 
CRUSHED BY THIS KID STEVE HOLT.

365
00:13:23,552 --> 00:13:26,847
- YEAH. I'D VOTE FOR STEVE. 
TOO BAD DAD'S ON THE LAM.

366
00:13:26,847 --> 00:13:28,765
YOU COULD FINALLY USE SOME 
OF HIS DIRTY TRICKS

367
00:13:28,765 --> 00:13:31,810
TO GET GEORGE MICHAEL ELECTED.

368
00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:33,728
narrator: AS IT HAPPENS, 
GEORGE, SR. HAD COME TO

369
00:13:33,728 --> 00:13:35,522
IN THE ATTIC,

370
00:13:35,522 --> 00:13:37,732
AND PERHAPS IT WAS THE EFFECT 
OF LOSING HIS ONE FRIEND...

371
00:13:37,732 --> 00:13:39,401
- POLLY?

372
00:13:39,401 --> 00:13:41,403
narrator: OR THE LINGERING 
EFFECTS OF THE FUMIGATION,

373
00:13:41,403 --> 00:13:44,031
OR PERHAPS IT REALLY WAS 
DIVINE INTERVENTION,

374
00:13:44,031 --> 00:13:46,491
BUT HE'D HAD 
A PROFOUND REALIZATION.

375
00:13:46,491 --> 00:13:47,993
- [sniffs]

376
00:13:51,205 --> 00:13:52,998
narrator: UNFORTUNATELY,

377
00:13:52,998 --> 00:13:55,292
THE TIMING OF THE ENLIGHTENMENT 
WASN'T IDEAL FOR MICHAEL.

378
00:13:55,292 --> 00:13:56,626
- THAT'S WHY I NEED YOUR HELP, 
POP.

379
00:13:56,626 --> 00:13:58,545
- "OUR HEAVENLY FATHER 
LET HIS SON DIE

380
00:13:58,545 --> 00:14:01,506
SO THAT OUR SINS 
COULD BE ABSOLVED."

381
00:14:01,506 --> 00:14:03,717
- GREAT. 
SO YOU'RE A CHRISTIAN NOW.

382
00:14:03,717 --> 00:14:05,719
- "WE MUST ALL SEEK 
FORGIVENESS."

383
00:14:05,719 --> 00:14:07,137
- WELL, I'LL CALL THE WARDEN 
FOR YOU.

384
00:14:07,137 --> 00:14:08,680
YOU CAN ASK HIM YOURSELF.

385
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:10,765
- WELL, I THINK THAT'S 
FOR FRESH CRIMES.

386
00:14:10,765 --> 00:14:13,435
BESIDES, YOU'VE ALWAYS 
TRIED TO LEAD A CLEAN LIFE.

387
00:14:13,435 --> 00:14:16,438
YOU AND GOB WERE LIKE THOSE 
BIBLICAL BROTHERS,

388
00:14:16,438 --> 00:14:20,109
GALLANT AND, UM...

389
00:14:20,109 --> 00:14:21,776
GOOFUTH.

390
00:14:21,776 --> 00:14:24,113
narrator: MICHAEL REALIZED 
HE HAD LIVED LIKE GALLANT,

391
00:14:24,113 --> 00:14:26,823
AND IF HE WANTED 
TO HELP HIS SON'S ELECTION,

392
00:14:26,823 --> 00:14:29,451
HE WOULD HAVE 
TO FIND GOOFUTH.

393
00:14:29,451 --> 00:14:31,328
- BEEN LOOKIN' ALL OVER 
FOR YOU, PAL.

394
00:14:31,328 --> 00:14:32,955
- IF YOU CAME TO GROVEL

395
00:14:32,955 --> 00:14:34,581
FOR THE JOB OF PRESIDENT, 
YOU'RE TOO LATE.

396
00:14:34,581 --> 00:14:36,333
MY BROTHER ALREADY FIRED ME.

397
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:39,086
- LISTEN, I'M REALLY SORRY 
THAT I GOT UPSET WITH YOU,

398
00:14:39,086 --> 00:14:42,923
YOU KNOW, AND I NEVER MEANT TO, 
UM--

399
00:14:42,923 --> 00:14:45,050
I DIDN'T EVEN MEAN TO FIRE YOU, 
YOU KNOW?

400
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:49,221
I JUST GOT SO FRUSTRATED, 
AND, GOB, YOU ARE MY BROTHER.

401
00:14:49,221 --> 00:14:51,181
OF COURSE I'M GONNA 
SUPPORT YOU.

402
00:14:51,181 --> 00:14:53,392
- WELL,

403
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:55,644
NOW I FEEL BAD 
FOR FIRING YOU.

404
00:14:55,644 --> 00:14:57,687
- LISTEN, GEORGE MICHAEL 
IS RUNNING

405
00:14:57,687 --> 00:14:59,439
FOR STUDENT BODY PRESIDENT,

406
00:14:59,439 --> 00:15:01,316
AND I HAVE A FEELING 
HE'S GONNA GET SLAUGHTERED.

407
00:15:01,316 --> 00:15:04,111
THE GUY HE'S RUNNING AGAINST 
IS BASICALLY A YOUNG YOU.

408
00:15:04,111 --> 00:15:09,909
- WOW. IT WON'T BE EASY 
TO WIN A RACE AGAINST MYSELF.

409
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:11,576
OF COURSE, 
IF ANYONE CAN DO IT, I CAN.

410
00:15:11,576 --> 00:15:14,413
- THAT'S RIGHT. 
- I WISH I WAS 15 YEARS YOUNGER.

411
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:15,747
- NOW, HE DOESN'T NEED 
TO BEAT HIM.

412
00:15:15,747 --> 00:15:17,791
HE JUST NEEDS 
TO BEAT THE INDIAN KID.

413
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:19,668
- IF I DO THIS, 
YOU'LL REHIRE ME?

414
00:15:19,668 --> 00:15:21,170
- OF COURSE I WILL.

415
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:22,796
- SEE, THE MERE FACT THAT 
YOU THINK YOU CAN

416
00:15:22,796 --> 00:15:24,256
SAYS TO ME 
THAT I SHOULDN'T LET YOU.

417
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:27,026
COURSE, 
WE BOTH NEED THE WORK.

418
00:15:27,026 --> 00:15:30,095
[bowl clatters]

419
00:15:30,095 --> 00:15:32,139
ROBOT'LL GET IT.

420
00:15:32,139 --> 00:15:35,017
- WHERE THE HELL IS MY MAID? 
ROBOT!

421
00:15:35,017 --> 00:15:37,227
narrator: BUT THE ROBOT 
WAS BUSY ELSEWHERE.

422
00:15:37,227 --> 00:15:38,645
- [gasps]

423
00:15:38,645 --> 00:15:39,729
- [gasps]

424
00:15:39,729 --> 00:15:40,897
[robot beeping]

425
00:15:40,897 --> 00:15:42,524
[robot powers down]

426
00:15:42,524 --> 00:15:45,569
WHAT DO YOU EXPECT, MOTHER? 
I'M HALF MACHINE!

427
00:15:45,569 --> 00:15:49,114
I'M A MONSTER!

428
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:52,326
[screaming and grunting]

429
00:15:57,539 --> 00:15:59,083
narrator: MICHAEL BROUGHT GOB IN

430
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:01,126
TO CONSULT 
ON HIS SON'S CAMPAIGN.

431
00:16:01,126 --> 00:16:04,088
- FOCUS ON THE VIDEO AND SHY 
AWAY FROM THE VIRGIN THING.

432
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:05,672
- OH, WE SHOULD 
DEFINITELY SACRIFICE

433
00:16:05,672 --> 00:16:07,049
THE WHOLE VIRGIN THING.

434
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:08,968
AND I GOT THE PERFECT WAY.

435
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:13,347
WE HAND OUT RUBBERS THAT SAY, 
"WE SALUTE GEORGE MICHAEL."

436
00:16:13,347 --> 00:16:15,140
WE'RE NOT EVEN SUPPOSED 
TO HAVE OUTSIDE HELP.

437
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:17,017
- AND I DON'T WANT 
TO MAKE STEVE LOOK BAD.

438
00:16:17,017 --> 00:16:19,103
- YEAH, I JUST DON'T WANT MY SON 
TO BE EMBARRASSED UP THERE,

439
00:16:19,103 --> 00:16:20,187
SO LET'S NOT PLAY TOO DIRTY.

440
00:16:20,187 --> 00:16:21,771
- UH, GOOD POINT, 2%.

441
00:16:21,771 --> 00:16:23,732
- 2%, HUH? IS THAT 
HOW LITTLE I LOST BY?

442
00:16:23,732 --> 00:16:25,900
- LOST BY? THAT'S ALL YOU GOT. 
- NOT REALLY IMPORTANT.

443
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:27,569
- YEAH, WELL, IF YOUR SON WANTS 
MORE THAN 2%,

444
00:16:27,569 --> 00:16:29,613
HE'S GONNA HAVE 
TO GO AFTER STEVE HOLT.

445
00:16:29,613 --> 00:16:31,698
SO I WANT YOU TO TELL ME 
EVERY AWFUL RUMOR

446
00:16:31,698 --> 00:16:33,575
YOU'VE EVER 
HEARD ABOUT THIS KID.

447
00:16:33,575 --> 00:16:35,035
- I CAN'T SUPPORT THIS,

448
00:16:35,035 --> 00:16:36,411
AND NEITHER CAN 
THE CHRISTIAN KIDS

449
00:16:36,411 --> 00:16:37,829
THAT WERE GONNA 
MAKE YOU PRESIDENT.

450
00:16:37,829 --> 00:16:38,830
- UH--SHE'S--

451
00:16:38,830 --> 00:16:40,290
ANN?

452
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:41,100
I THINK SHE'S REALLY UPSET 
ABOUT THIS.

453
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:45,379
- SHE'LL FORGIVE YOU. 
YOU'RE GEORGE MICHAEL.

454
00:16:45,379 --> 00:16:47,381
narrator: MEANWHILE, 
DOWNSTAIRS,

455
00:16:47,381 --> 00:16:50,009
MAEBY WAS MEETING 
HER NEW SINGING NANNY.

456
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:53,262
- NOW. TAKE YOUR FUN-FUN.

457
00:16:53,262 --> 00:16:55,180
- THIS IS MY MOM'S,

458
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:57,807
AND IT'S FEN-PHEN, AND IT'S 
BEEN BANNED BY THE F.D.A.

459
00:16:57,807 --> 00:16:59,768
- OH! WELL.

460
00:16:59,768 --> 00:17:02,396
[singing] YOU SHOULD ALWAYS 
READ THE LABEL

461
00:17:02,396 --> 00:17:04,148
YOU SHOULD ALWAYS 
READ IT WELL

462
00:17:04,148 --> 00:17:06,025
IN THE MOST DELICIOUS WAY

463
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:08,027
- MR. FINGERBOTTOM? 
- MRS.

464
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:10,487
- RIGHT. MRS. 
I SHOULD REALLY GET GOING.

465
00:17:10,487 --> 00:17:13,532
- NO, NO, NO, NO, NO. SIT BACK. 
WHAT'S THE RUSH? PLEASE.

466
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:16,135
I WANT TO HEAR ABOUT YOU. 
TELL ME ABOUT YOUR FAMILY.

467
00:17:16,135 --> 00:17:19,413
I'M SURE WHEREVER 
YOUR FATHER IS RIGHT NOW,

468
00:17:19,413 --> 00:17:22,249
SHE LOVES YOU VERY, VERY MUCH.

469
00:17:22,249 --> 00:17:24,876
- NOT ENOUGH TO BE HONEST 
WITH ME.

470
00:17:27,337 --> 00:17:29,631
narrator: AND AFTER A FEW DAYS, 
GOB WAS READY

471
00:17:29,631 --> 00:17:32,134
TO UNVEIL 
GEORGE MICHAEL'S NEW MESSAGE.

472
00:17:32,134 --> 00:17:34,844
- DROUGHT, STARVATION--

473
00:17:34,844 --> 00:17:36,513
THESE ARE THE THINGS MY FAMILY 
HAS HAD

474
00:17:36,513 --> 00:17:39,266
TO DEAL 
WITH FOR GENERATIONS,

475
00:17:39,266 --> 00:17:43,228
ALTHOUGH, FORTUNATELY, NOT SINCE 
WE MOVED TO CORONA DEL MAR.

00:17:43,228 --> 00:17:44,479
[scattered applause]

477
00:17:44,479 --> 00:17:46,440
- GO HOME, YOU TERRORIST!

478
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,167
- HOW STUPID DO YOU HAVE TO BE 
TO SAY SOMETHING LIKE THAT?

479
00:17:48,167 --> 00:17:51,445
- YOU'RE NOT WANTED HERE!

480
00:17:51,445 --> 00:17:53,530
- GOB. 
- MICHAEL.

481
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:55,490
- YOU GOT GEORGE MICHAEL'S TAPE?

482
00:17:55,490 --> 00:17:57,242
- YEAH. I GAVE IT 
TO THE TECH GUY.

483
00:17:57,242 --> 00:17:59,494
DON'T WORRY. 
IT'S VERY TASTEFULLY DONE.

484
00:17:59,494 --> 00:18:01,246
SURE YOU DIDN'T MAKE THAT VIDEO 
IN A CAVE?

485
00:18:01,246 --> 00:18:03,498

PERENNIAL CANDIDATE STEVE HOLT!

narrator: AND SOON IT WAS TIME

487
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:07,211
FOR STEVE HOLT 
TO PLAY HIS VIDEO,

488
00:18:07,211 --> 00:18:09,754
WHICH HAD BEEN PRODUCED 
BY HIS NEW CAMPAIGN MANAGER,

ANN VEAL.

490

STEVE HOLT!

[cheering]

493
00:18:16,928 --> 00:18:18,388
- THIS KID'S POPULAR?

494
00:18:18,388 --> 00:18:21,015
LOOKS LIKE A CHICK I DID 
ONCE IN HIGH SCHOOL.

495
00:18:21,015 --> 00:18:23,393
GET A HAIRCUT!

496
00:18:23,393 --> 00:18:25,229
- BUT RECENTLY, 
I'VE BEEN DEALING

497
00:18:25,229 --> 00:18:27,021
WITH THE FACT THAT 
I'VE NEVER KNOWN MY FATHER,

498
00:18:27,021 --> 00:18:29,858
BUT I FINALLY 
FOUND A NEW FATHER.

499
00:18:29,858 --> 00:18:33,027
YOU'RE PROBABLY WONDERING 
WHAT THESE FOOTSTEPS ARE.

500
00:18:33,027 --> 00:18:35,239
WELL, THIS IS MY SECOND TAKE.

501
00:18:35,239 --> 00:18:38,533
IT'S KIND OF LIKE 
A SECOND CHANCE AT MAKING GOOD.

502
00:18:38,533 --> 00:18:40,827
[all cheering]

503
00:18:40,827 --> 00:18:44,539
- YEAH. OKAY. WE NEED 
TO PULL THE VIDEOTAPE.

504
00:18:44,539 --> 00:18:45,624
- MY TAPE? 
- WHY?

505
00:18:45,624 --> 00:18:47,417
- I'VE MADE A HUGE MISTAKE.

506
00:18:47,417 --> 00:18:50,254
- narrator: BUT IT WAS TOO 
LATE TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT.

507
00:18:50,254 --> 00:18:52,547
- STEVE HOLT IS A BASTARD.

508
00:18:52,547 --> 00:18:56,176
HE DOESN'T EVEN 
KNOW WHO HIS REAL FATHER IS.

509
00:18:56,176 --> 00:19:00,264
WHAT ELSE DON'T WE KNOW 
ABOUT STEVE HOLT?

510
00:19:00,264 --> 00:19:03,433
GEORGE MICHAEL BLUTH 
IS A COOL GUY.

511
00:19:03,433 --> 00:19:06,853
HIS DAD IS A POWERFUL EXECUTIVE 
WORKING FOR THIS MAN.

512
00:19:06,853 --> 00:19:09,189
THE GIRLS LIKE HIM JUST FINE.

513
00:19:09,189 --> 00:19:11,107
YOUNG AND OLD. 
IT DOESN'T MATTER.

514
00:19:11,107 --> 00:19:12,692
IN THE DARK.

515
00:19:12,692 --> 00:19:14,253
- THAT'S WHY YOU HAD ME 
DO THAT?

516
00:19:14,253 --> 00:19:18,990
narrator: GEORGE MICHAEL 
HAD NEVER BEEN MORE EMBARRASSED.

517
00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:20,450
UNTIL THIS PART.

518
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:24,454
- UH-OH. I COULDN'T 
FIND ANOTHER TAPE.

519
00:19:24,454 --> 00:19:27,541
[kids laughing hysterically]

520
00:19:29,459 --> 00:19:32,754
I LIKE STEVE'S MORE.

521
00:19:32,754 --> 00:19:35,089
- GUESS I UNDERESTIMATED 
THE RELIGIOUS VOTE.

522
00:19:35,089 --> 00:19:36,508
SO STEVE WON?

523
00:19:36,508 --> 00:19:38,092
- NO. STEVE DROPPED OUT 
OF THE RACE.

524
00:19:38,092 --> 00:19:39,719
HE SAYS HE WANTS 
TO SPEND SOME TIME TRYING

525
00:19:39,719 --> 00:19:41,471
TO FIND HIS REAL FATHER.

526
00:19:41,471 --> 00:19:44,183
YOU KNOW, RAV NADIR, THE INDIAN 
KID, HE GOT 97% OF THE VOTE.

527
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:46,142
- WELL, THAT LEAVES 3%.

528
00:19:46,142 --> 00:19:49,062
YOU DID BETTER 
THAN I DID WHEN I RAN.

529
00:19:49,062 --> 00:19:51,440
- I TIED WITH BART SIMPSON 
AND "SCHOOL SUCKS."

530
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,899
- I'M REALLY SORRY, BUDDY.

531
00:19:52,899 --> 00:19:54,776
BELIEVE IT OR NOT, 
I ONLY DID THIS

532
00:19:54,776 --> 00:19:56,861
BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT YOU 
TO FEEL BAD ABOUT YOURSELF.

533
00:19:56,861 --> 00:19:58,738
- HEY, IT'S STAR DORK.

534
00:19:58,738 --> 00:20:02,409
- HEY, HE KNOWS YOU NOW. 
I'M REALLY SORRY, BUDDY.

535
00:20:02,409 --> 00:20:04,286
- IT'S JUST A DRAG.

536
00:20:04,286 --> 00:20:06,496
I MEAN, I'M PRETTY SURE MY 
GIRLFRIEND'S GONE FOREVER,

537
00:20:06,496 --> 00:20:08,665
AND I NEVER WANTED 
TO DO THIS IN THE FIRST PLACE.

538
00:20:08,665 --> 00:20:11,210
- GEORGE MICHAEL, 
WAS THAT REALLY YOU

539
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:13,312
DOING THOSE LIGHTSABER MOVES?

540
00:20:13,312 --> 00:20:15,547
YOU WERE INCREDIBLE.

541
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:18,342
- I'VE ONLY GOTTEN BETTER.

542
00:20:18,342 --> 00:20:20,969
- YOU'RE STILL DOIN' THAT?

543
00:20:20,969 --> 00:20:22,929
- SO YOU WANT 
TO GRAB A CURTAIN ROD

544
00:20:22,929 --> 00:20:25,098
AND GO OVER TO MY PLACE?

545
00:20:25,098 --> 00:20:27,326
- WOW. I'D LOVE THAT. 
THANKS, ANN.

546
00:20:27,326 --> 00:20:30,354
YOU REALLY MAKE ME 
FEEL GOOD ABOUT MYSELF.

547
00:20:34,441 --> 00:20:37,777
- GOT TO DO SOMETHING 
ABOUT THAT KID'S SELF-ESTEEM.

548
00:20:37,777 --> 00:20:42,449
narrator: ON THE NEXT 
"ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT..."

549
00:20:42,449 --> 00:20:45,744
- YOO-HOO! I'LL TAKE YOU 
THE REST OF THE WAY!

550
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:47,454
narrator: LUCILLE FINDS 
A HOUSEKEEPER

551
00:20:47,454 --> 00:20:49,122
THAT SHE WON'T LOSE HER SON TO.

552
00:20:49,122 --> 00:20:51,375
- [singing] ALWAYS KEEP 
FROM CRYING

553
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:55,587
EVEN THOUGH YOUR HEART 
IS DYING

554
00:20:55,587 --> 00:20:57,506
[both crying]

555
00:21:00,008 --> 00:21:03,553
narrator: AND STEVE HOLT FINALLY 
TRACKS DOWN HIS REAL FATHER.

556
00:21:03,553 --> 00:21:05,680
- I'VE BEEN WONDERIN' 
MY WHOLE LIFE WHO HE IS--

557
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:09,142
A SCIENTIST, 
A DOCTOR, A SENATOR?

558
00:21:09,142 --> 00:21:12,186
- WELL, WE GOT SOME BAD NEWS.

559
00:21:12,186 --> 00:21:16,858
- WOW. IS THAT WHAT'S 
GONNA HAPPEN TO MY HAIR?
