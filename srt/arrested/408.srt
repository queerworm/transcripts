NARRATOR:<i> Even though</i>
<i>it was only a hundred miles</i>

2
00:00:13,583 --> 00:00:16,542
<i>from her hometown</i>
<i>of Newport Beach,</i>

3
00:00:16,583 --> 00:00:20,125
<i>the desert created a whole new</i>
<i>value system for Lindsay Bluth.</i>

4
00:00:20,166 --> 00:00:22,542
I'd give $20,000
for a lemonade right now.

5
00:00:22,583 --> 00:00:24,542
<i>For the most part.</i>

6
00:00:24,583 --> 00:00:27,333
<i>It was here that she'd moved</i>
<i>with her activist boyfriend...</i>

7
00:00:27,375 --> 00:00:30,542
Marky! Mommy needs mescaline!

8
00:00:30,583 --> 00:00:31,542
<i>...and his mother.</i>

9
00:00:31,583 --> 00:00:33,750
And tell your girlfriend DeBrie

10
00:00:33,792 --> 00:00:35,041
to shovel that ostrich crap!

11
00:00:35,083 --> 00:00:36,667
It's not DeBrie, Ma Bark.

12
00:00:36,709 --> 00:00:38,250
It's Lindsay.

13
00:00:38,291 --> 00:00:39,959
I just cut off my hair.

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,250
I know who you are.

15
00:00:41,291 --> 00:00:42,542
Now start shoveling!

16
00:00:42,583 --> 00:00:44,458
God, you're lazier than Lindsay.

17
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:45,542
(sighs)

18
00:00:45,583 --> 00:00:47,667
(gasps)
Marky, hurry!

19
00:00:47,709 --> 00:00:49,417
-There's another dead iguana.
-Oh.

20
00:00:49,458 --> 00:00:51,208
What does this mean?

21
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:53,166
Probably those bastards
next door.

22
00:00:53,208 --> 00:00:56,000
<i>The bastards next door were</i>
<i>actually a gathered group</i>

23
00:00:56,041 --> 00:01:00,166
<i>of CEOs who were attending</i>
<i>a mid-summer sweat and squeeze.</i>

24
00:01:00,208 --> 00:01:01,792
MARKY:
They want us off their land.

25
00:01:01,834 --> 00:01:03,709
Probably so they can
build a border wall.

26
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:06,583
They just want to separate
the whites from the browns.

27
00:01:06,625 --> 00:01:08,417
You really are color-blind.

28
00:01:08,458 --> 00:01:09,709
Face-blind.

29
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:11,458
Fortunately, I can see color.

30
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:14,333
That's how I can tell
the browns are the Mexicans.

31
00:01:14,375 --> 00:01:16,875
Anyway, I thought
I scared those bastards off

32
00:01:16,917 --> 00:01:18,041
<i>by scaring their leader.</i>

33
00:01:18,083 --> 00:01:19,917
The strong will become the weak.

34
00:01:19,959 --> 00:01:22,750
<i>But I think I overdid it first</i>
<i>on the maca, because I ended up</i>

35
00:01:22,792 --> 00:01:24,333
<i>seeing two of him.</i>

36
00:01:24,375 --> 00:01:26,166
But to kill an innocent iguana,

37
00:01:26,208 --> 00:01:28,166
this beautiful creature
of the desert...

38
00:01:28,208 --> 00:01:29,583
-(hissing)
-That lizard bastard bit me!

39
00:01:29,625 --> 00:01:31,000
God!

40
00:01:31,041 --> 00:01:32,792
Who keeps numbing
these desert animals?

41
00:01:32,834 --> 00:01:33,834
No, no, we'll kill it later.

42
00:01:33,875 --> 00:01:35,083
Mom, lizard bite!

43
00:01:35,125 --> 00:01:36,667
Put some rubbing mescaline
on it!

44
00:01:36,709 --> 00:01:38,417
NARRATOR:
<i>Lindsay hated her new life,</i>

45
00:01:38,458 --> 00:01:39,667
<i>but even more,</i>
<i>she hated herself</i>

46
00:01:39,709 --> 00:01:41,542
<i>for hating her new life.</i>

47
00:01:41,583 --> 00:01:43,583
Marky, I just don't know how
much more of this I can take.

48
00:01:43,625 --> 00:01:45,333
I'm surrounded
by squalor and death,

49
00:01:45,375 --> 00:01:47,458
and I still can't be happy.

50
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:49,083
Yeah, well,
it's only gonna get worse,

51
00:01:49,125 --> 00:01:50,959
'cause they're chasing us
off the land.

52
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,250
I mean, where are we gonna go?

53
00:01:52,291 --> 00:01:53,375
Hey, new girl, I just heard

54
00:01:53,417 --> 00:01:55,000
about your mother's trial.

55
00:01:55,041 --> 00:01:56,709
She was sent away.

56
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:59,667
<i>Lindsay had missed</i>
<i>her own mother's trial,</i>

57
00:01:59,709 --> 00:02:02,208
<i>and for that, she'd never</i>
<i>be able to forgive her...</i>

58
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:03,959
Hey, I know a place
that just opened up.

59
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,208
<i>...herself.</i>

60
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:07,208
<i>Now the story of a family</i>

61
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:09,417
<i>whose future</i>
<i>was abruptly canceled,</i>

62
00:02:09,458 --> 00:02:11,834
<i>and the one daughter</i>
<i>who had no choice</i>

63
00:02:11,875 --> 00:02:14,041
<i>but to keep her life together.</i>

64
00:02:18,375 --> 00:02:20,166
<i>It's Lindsay's </i>
Arrested Development.

65
00:02:22,291 --> 00:02:23,917
<i>-Lindsay wanted to move </i>
-That's great.

66
00:02:23,959 --> 00:02:26,041
<i>to her mother's</i>
<i>empty penthouse,</i>

67
00:02:26,083 --> 00:02:27,125
<i>-but Marky wouldn't think </i>
-You dropped your shovel.

68
00:02:27,166 --> 00:02:29,417
<i>of leaving the old bird behind.</i>

69
00:02:29,458 --> 00:02:30,667
(clucking)

70
00:02:30,709 --> 00:02:32,458
<i>So it was a party of three</i>

71
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:35,709
<i>that had to sneak into</i>
<i>the Balboa Towers.</i>

72
00:02:37,792 --> 00:02:39,291
<i>Although Marky</i>
<i>was having trouble</i>

73
00:02:39,333 --> 00:02:41,166
<i>-accepting what appeared to be </i>
-Come on, Cindy.

74
00:02:41,208 --> 00:02:42,458
<i>a lavish lifestyle.</i>

75
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:43,875
-What do you think?
-Ugh.

76
00:02:43,917 --> 00:02:45,667
Smells weird in here.
What is that?

77
00:02:45,709 --> 00:02:48,083
I think it's just... not urine.

78
00:02:48,125 --> 00:02:49,667
And we're not moving in,

79
00:02:49,709 --> 00:02:52,166
we're occupying a space
with central air.

80
00:02:52,208 --> 00:02:53,166
(Cindy squawks)

81
00:02:53,208 --> 00:02:54,166
Cindy?

82
00:02:54,208 --> 00:02:56,000
You okay?

83
00:02:56,041 --> 00:02:58,750
(chuckles): Look, Lindsay,
Cindy already marked the master.

84
00:02:58,792 --> 00:02:59,750
Okay.

85
00:02:59,792 --> 00:03:02,000
This will be where she goes.

86
00:03:02,041 --> 00:03:03,583
So we're staying.

87
00:03:03,625 --> 00:03:07,500
And we will change the world
and hold our heads high.

88
00:03:07,542 --> 00:03:11,917
And it might be nice to live
like normal people for a change.

89
00:03:11,959 --> 00:03:14,417
Let's put some newspaper
on these windows.

90
00:03:15,917 --> 00:03:18,166
(clucking)

91
00:03:18,208 --> 00:03:20,542
<i>One year later, however,</i>

92
00:03:20,583 --> 00:03:22,709
<i>the only thing</i>
<i>they'd actually changed was</i>

93
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:25,208
<i>getting the "not urine" smell</i>
<i>out of the penthouse.</i>

94
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:27,000
(clucking)

95
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:29,375
You're looking at Lindsay.

96
00:03:29,417 --> 00:03:30,375
Still Lindsay.

97
00:03:30,417 --> 00:03:31,917
Oh. Hey, Linds.

98
00:03:31,959 --> 00:03:33,834
-How was beg?
-Beg was good.

99
00:03:33,875 --> 00:03:35,625
I found some<i> tres leches</i> cake.

100
00:03:35,667 --> 00:03:36,625
That's great.

101
00:03:36,667 --> 00:03:38,375
Hey, did you clean up?

102
00:03:38,417 --> 00:03:41,000
No, no, I just cleared out a
space to work on the Love bomb.

103
00:03:41,041 --> 00:03:43,834
Oh, okay. I'll, uh, change
out of these filthy clothes

104
00:03:43,875 --> 00:03:45,333
and into some filthy lingerie.

105
00:03:45,375 --> 00:03:47,166
I don't think I washed it.

106
00:03:47,208 --> 00:03:50,417
No, I meant what we're gonna do
to this guy-- Herbert Love.

107
00:03:50,458 --> 00:03:52,041
Oh.

108
00:03:52,083 --> 00:03:54,083
<i>Herbert Love was a very</i>
<i>conservative candidate</i>

109
00:03:54,125 --> 00:03:56,083
<i>for a very conservative seat</i>
<i>in the very conservative</i>

110
00:03:56,125 --> 00:03:57,625
<i>-House of Representatives. </i>
<i>-Look, look, look.</i>

111
00:03:57,667 --> 00:03:59,959
<i>Am I guilty of anything? Yes.</i>

112
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,291
<i>Of having a great</i>
<i>sense of humor.</i>

113
00:04:02,333 --> 00:04:04,792
<i>But the two women</i>
<i>who accused me of this crime</i>

114
00:04:04,834 --> 00:04:06,959
<i>do not have</i>
<i>a great sense of humor.</i>

115
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,709
<i>Look, in fact, I'll tell you the</i>
<i>joke and let you be the judge...</i>

116
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:11,375
<i>Although he was prone to</i>

117
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:13,000
<i>the more than occasional</i>
<i>harassment scandal.</i>

118
00:04:13,041 --> 00:04:14,542
<i>I forgot the joke.</i>

119
00:04:14,583 --> 00:04:16,917
Oh, he's about to be harassed,
all right.

120
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:19,542
I'm gonna spray the bastards
with ink and glitter.

121
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:21,667
It'll be in their ears
for weeks.

122
00:04:21,709 --> 00:04:23,542
Thing is, I can't find
the glitter anywhere.

123
00:04:23,583 --> 00:04:25,125
Did you take the silver glitter?

124
00:04:25,166 --> 00:04:27,250
Nope. I mean,
I'd say check the junk drawer,

125
00:04:27,291 --> 00:04:28,917
but I can't
differentiate anymore.

126
00:04:28,959 --> 00:04:31,291
Oh, God, what is this?

127
00:04:31,333 --> 00:04:32,500
Oh. Okay, good.
Perfect timing,

128
00:04:32,542 --> 00:04:34,041
because this is
where you come in.

129
00:04:34,083 --> 00:04:36,375
A lot of this has to do
with ink compression,

130
00:04:36,417 --> 00:04:38,041
oxygen capacity,
expulsion pressures.

131
00:04:38,083 --> 00:04:41,125
But the point is,
three days before the event,

132
00:04:41,166 --> 00:04:43,208
I'm gonna take the explosive
and hide in the podium.

133
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:45,250
On the night of the event,
at exactly 7:30,

134
00:04:45,291 --> 00:04:46,750
I'm gonna pull the pin
to the tank.

135
00:04:46,792 --> 00:04:48,333
Then you're gonna (knocking)
knock on the podium door

136
00:04:48,375 --> 00:04:50,166
to let me know
that the coast is clear.

137
00:04:50,208 --> 00:04:53,166
When Love steps up to the podium
at exactly 8:00, blam!

138
00:04:53,208 --> 00:04:56,333
The podium doors burst open,
and he and everyone will be...

139
00:04:56,375 --> 00:04:58,208
Blue in the face, yeah.

140
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:00,000
That's better than
what I had, actually.

141
00:05:00,041 --> 00:05:01,834
I was gonna say they'd be
covered in ink and glitter.

142
00:05:01,875 --> 00:05:04,291
Or we can support Lucille 2,
who he's running against.

143
00:05:04,333 --> 00:05:05,917
She's right across the hall.

144
00:05:05,959 --> 00:05:08,542
No, no!
She's part of the problem.

145
00:05:08,583 --> 00:05:10,542
Wait, you haven't been
going over there, by the way?

146
00:05:10,583 --> 00:05:12,291
-No one can know we're here.
-Of course not.

147
00:05:12,333 --> 00:05:14,166
Does it look like I'm lying?

148
00:05:14,208 --> 00:05:16,375
<i>It did.</i>

149
00:05:16,417 --> 00:05:19,166
<i>But not to a man</i>
<i>with face-blindness.</i>

150
00:05:19,208 --> 00:05:21,041
Yeah, no, I guess not.

151
00:05:21,083 --> 00:05:22,834
<i>Because Lindsay</i>
<i>could only spend</i>

152
00:05:22,875 --> 00:05:24,834
<i>so many hours with a shrill,</i>
<i>feathered creature...</i>

153
00:05:24,875 --> 00:05:25,917
(Lucille 2 squawks)

154
00:05:25,959 --> 00:05:27,375
<i>...and needed to get away.</i>

155
00:05:27,417 --> 00:05:29,417
You look marvelous in that!

156
00:05:29,458 --> 00:05:30,875
Here, try this on.

157
00:05:30,917 --> 00:05:32,417
I can't believe
how much I've missed

158
00:05:32,458 --> 00:05:33,959
the feel of anything
that isn't hemp.

159
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,083
And try this on.

160
00:05:35,125 --> 00:05:36,542
Isn't that funny?

161
00:05:36,583 --> 00:05:38,208
I used to wear that
with the Captain.

162
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:39,208
And I was...

163
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:40,583
Tennille?

164
00:05:40,625 --> 00:05:42,792
And not make contact, yes!

165
00:05:42,834 --> 00:05:45,083
What am I gonna do,
cut it down for my foster child?

166
00:05:45,125 --> 00:05:47,000
<i>That is what she wanted to do,</i>

167
00:05:47,041 --> 00:05:50,458
<i>until he threatened to call</i>
<i>Social Services.</i>

168
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,458
Oh, look what I made you.

169
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:54,166
Oh! I love it!

170
00:05:54,208 --> 00:05:55,917
It's glittery!

171
00:05:55,959 --> 00:05:59,458
<i>Lindsay was no stranger</i>
<i>to making campaign posters,</i>

172
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:02,000
<i>having made several</i>

176
00:06:10,166 --> 00:06:11,625
A couple of tiny notes, hon.

177
00:06:11,667 --> 00:06:14,291
There are two S's in "congress."

178
00:06:14,333 --> 00:06:16,000
And I just
call myself Lucille...

179
00:06:16,041 --> 00:06:17,750
Lucille 1. I'm so sorry.

180
00:06:17,792 --> 00:06:19,000
No.

181
00:06:19,041 --> 00:06:20,083
Just Lucille.

182
00:06:20,125 --> 00:06:21,667
But I love it!

183
00:06:21,709 --> 00:06:24,125
Oh, I wish you'd officially work
for my campaign.

184
00:06:24,166 --> 00:06:25,458
We could make such a difference.

185
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,583
Well, Marky says that's not

186
00:06:27,625 --> 00:06:29,000
the way we should make change.

187
00:06:29,041 --> 00:06:30,542
Oh, speaking of, do you mind

188
00:06:30,583 --> 00:06:32,625
if I go through
your couch cushions?

189
00:06:32,667 --> 00:06:35,667
Oh, honey, I wish you'd take the
rest of this<i> tres leches</i> cake.

190
00:06:35,709 --> 00:06:38,000
It's from a dear
Hispanic supporter.

191
00:06:38,041 --> 00:06:41,083
And I'll never get it
into the bay in one piece.

192
00:06:41,125 --> 00:06:43,375
Honestly, Lucille 2,
you've been like a mother to me.

193
00:06:43,417 --> 00:06:44,959
Aw.

194
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,792
Except kind and loving
and willing to let me eat.

195
00:06:47,834 --> 00:06:50,125
It just blows me away.

196
00:06:50,166 --> 00:06:51,792
<i>Lindsay knew she had to keep</i>

198
00:06:54,125 --> 00:06:55,375
You're looking at Lindsay.

199
00:06:55,417 --> 00:06:56,500
Still Lindsay.

200
00:06:56,542 --> 00:06:57,917
<i>...from a boyfriend that was</i>

201

202

<i>for three days</i>
<i>with a paint bomb.</i>

203
00:07:01,792 --> 00:07:03,667
But, Marky, I mean,
won't you go crazy in there?

204
00:07:03,709 --> 00:07:05,709
Oh, no, that's nothing.
I once did a week and a half

205
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:07,208
in an oil drum
just to throw a pie

206
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:08,208
at Arnold Schwarzenegger.
(chuckles)

207
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:09,667
I never heard about that.

208
00:07:09,709 --> 00:07:11,709
Oh, yeah, well,
the press tried to spin it as

209
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:14,083
"Hippie tries to play pie-tin
Frisbee with the governor,"

210
00:07:14,125 --> 00:07:15,959
but... this time,
I'm eating beforehand.

211
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,959
Yeah, I-I see that.

212
00:07:18,041 --> 00:07:19,834
Hey, can I get you a fork?

213
00:07:19,875 --> 00:07:23,041
'Cause that's my brother
whose face you're licking.

214
00:07:23,083 --> 00:07:25,166
That's a face?

215
00:07:25,208 --> 00:07:27,417
Everything I do is wrong.

216
00:07:27,458 --> 00:07:28,625
-(sighs)
-I knew you wouldn't be

217
00:07:28,667 --> 00:07:29,709
on board with this, Lindsay.

218
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:30,709
I'm sorry to say this,

219
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:32,417
but you are losing your passion.

220
00:07:32,458 --> 00:07:34,709
What passion?
You don't even look at me.

221
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:36,458
I don't know
if I've said this before--

222
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:37,959
it's not important or anything--

223
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,625
but I'm really, really pretty.

224
00:07:39,667 --> 00:07:41,166
I'm the straightest guy
you know!

225
00:07:41,208 --> 00:07:42,500
Why does every man feel like

226
00:07:42,542 --> 00:07:44,083
they have to say that to me?

227
00:07:44,125 --> 00:07:46,291
-(clucking)
-Quiet! Cindy's in heat.

228
00:07:46,333 --> 00:07:48,083
You know how much she hates it
when we argue.

229
00:07:48,125 --> 00:07:49,959
(whispering): Now listen to me.
This protest of mine

230
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,208
-can really make a difference.
-Yeah, it's gonna land you

231
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:53,417
-in jail, Marky.
-Oh, there it is.

232
00:07:53,458 --> 00:07:54,750
Oh, yeah, so that's-- oh, yeah.

233
00:07:54,792 --> 00:07:56,417
You know what,
you are just as selfish

234
00:07:56,458 --> 00:07:57,959
-and money-hungry
as you ever were. 
-No, I'm...

235
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,709
-Yes, you are.
-That's not true.

236
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:01,667
Ooh, a Neiman's catalog.

237
00:08:01,709 --> 00:08:05,166
<i>But it was what she found</i>
<i>stuck inside the catalog</i>

238
00:08:05,208 --> 00:08:06,875
<i>that got her attention.</i>

239
00:08:06,917 --> 00:08:08,458
<i>And that's when she found</i>

"From Gangie 4: Facelift."

241
00:08:11,667 --> 00:08:14,250
What a load of...

242
00:08:14,291 --> 00:08:15,917
Mother.

243
00:08:15,959 --> 00:08:18,667
<i>And this time, she did</i>
<i>make a court appearance.</i>

244
00:08:18,709 --> 00:08:21,667
Cheryl, you've got no backhand!

245
00:08:21,709 --> 00:08:23,208
I'm working the whole court,

246
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:26,333
and you keep hitting the balls
(bleep) high.

247
00:08:26,375 --> 00:08:29,750
Oh, great, looks like we've got
another high-end hooker in here.

248
00:08:29,792 --> 00:08:31,250
Oh, thank you, Mother.

249
00:08:31,291 --> 00:08:33,458
LUCILLE:
<i>So, let's cut to the chase.</i>

250
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:37,083
I want to talk to you about
a check for plastic surgery.

251
00:08:37,125 --> 00:08:39,083
I already wrote you
a check for that.

252

NARRATOR:<i> Lucille had,</i>

-"Nosy."
-LUCILLE:<i> And you should be</i>

<i>thanking me for that.</i>

259
00:08:53,083 --> 00:08:54,792
You looked like a can opener.

260
00:08:54,834 --> 00:08:57,083
No, a check for my daughter.

261
00:08:57,125 --> 00:08:58,375
She's gorgeous.

262
00:08:58,417 --> 00:09:00,083
And I love her
just the way she is.

263
00:09:00,125 --> 00:09:02,125
When was the last time
you saw her?

264
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:05,166
She's been living
with her father the past year,

265
00:09:05,208 --> 00:09:09,375
and it's been... really hard.

266
00:09:09,417 --> 00:09:12,542
I'll be out on parole
by the time you work up a tear.

267
00:09:12,583 --> 00:09:15,458
What makes you think I wrote
a check to your daughter, nosy?

268
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:16,834
It came to the penthouse.

269
00:09:16,875 --> 00:09:18,583
Well, well.

270
00:09:18,625 --> 00:09:21,000
Little Miss Lives-Off-the-Land

271
00:09:21,041 --> 00:09:24,250
Okay, so you figured it out,
Gene Parmesan.

272
00:09:24,291 --> 00:09:28,542
Just goes to show, the apple
does not far from the tree fall.

273
00:09:28,583 --> 00:09:30,917
I am like you nothing.

274
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:33,166
You're not even my real mother.

275
00:09:33,208 --> 00:09:34,917
I am a political activist.

276
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:38,250
Oh, you're a lot more like me
than you know, sister.

277
00:09:38,291 --> 00:09:40,500
Except I can back up
my bad choices.

278
00:09:40,542 --> 00:09:42,375
I'm doing hard time.

00:12:04,875 --> 00:12:06,542
Tell your therapist I tried.

344
00:12:06,583 --> 00:12:09,041
NARRATOR:<i> But realizing</i>
<i>she was still too early</i>

345
00:12:09,083 --> 00:12:10,959
<i>to let Marky out of the podium,</i>

346
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,375
<i>Lindsay headed to the bar,</i>

347
00:12:13,417 --> 00:12:15,250
<i>and that's when she met the man</i>
<i>she was there to sabotage...</i>

348
00:12:15,291 --> 00:12:16,792
Is it just me,

349
00:12:16,834 --> 00:12:19,583
or are we the only two people
who don't fit in

350
00:12:19,625 --> 00:12:22,709
with all these
Orange County phonies?

351
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:24,625
(sighs)

352
00:12:24,667 --> 00:12:26,417
<i>...and had no idea who he was.</i>

353
00:12:26,458 --> 00:12:28,625
They are a bunch of phonies.

354
00:12:28,667 --> 00:12:30,000
I usually don't even go
to these things.

355
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:31,083
NARRATOR:
<i>And perhaps it was</i>

356
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:32,792
<i>because he reminded her so much</i>

357
00:12:32,834 --> 00:12:35,333
<i>of Tobias</i>
<i>when they first started dating,</i>

358
00:12:35,375 --> 00:12:37,083
<i>but Lindsay flirted back.</i>

359
00:12:37,125 --> 00:12:38,500
What's your name, princess?

360
00:12:38,542 --> 00:12:41,041
Cindy Featherbottom.

361
00:12:41,083 --> 00:12:43,458
Of the Laguna Beach
Featherbottoms?

362
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:45,250
Are you trying to find out
where I live?

363
00:12:45,291 --> 00:12:47,917
-And your favorite kind
of jewelry. 
-(both laugh)

364
00:12:47,959 --> 00:12:49,667
NARRATOR:<i> Lindsay hadn't heard</i>
<i>the word "jewelry"</i>

365
00:12:49,709 --> 00:12:52,083
<i>in a long time</i>
<i>but tried to stay strong.</i>

366
00:12:52,125 --> 00:12:55,041
How do I know you're not
one of these phonies?

367
00:12:55,083 --> 00:12:59,166
The only phony I'm interested in
is your phony number.

368
00:12:59,208 --> 00:13:01,125
NARRATOR:<i> And like Cinderella</i>
<i>at the ball,</i>

369
00:13:01,166 --> 00:13:03,625
<i>Lindsay really felt</i>
<i>like a princess for a change...</i>

370
00:13:03,667 --> 00:13:04,834
Okay.

371
00:13:04,875 --> 00:13:06,667
<i>...but also like Cinderella,</i>

372
00:13:06,709 --> 00:13:09,166
<i>-she lost track of the time...</i>
-It's, uh, 714... -Mm-hmm.

373
00:13:09,208 --> 00:13:10,417
(explosion)

374
00:13:10,458 --> 00:13:12,125
(Marky screams)

375
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:14,375
-(Lindsay sighing)
<i>-...and had forgotten</i>

376
00:13:14,417 --> 00:13:17,000
<i>to release Marky</i>
<i>from the podium,</i>

377
00:13:17,041 --> 00:13:18,959
<i>and that's when she was struck</i>

378
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,166
<i>-with an eerie sense...</i>
-Right this way, sir,

379
00:13:20,208 --> 00:13:21,875
-right this way.
<i>-...of díjè vu.</i>

380
00:13:21,917 --> 00:13:23,000
Lindsay.

381
00:13:23,041 --> 00:13:26,208
Oh, God, he blued himself.

382
00:13:30,166 --> 00:13:31,709
NARRATOR:<i> Lindsay's attempt</i>
<i>to create a disaster</i>

383
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:34,083
<i>for Herbert Love was</i>
<i>a complete disaster,</i>

384
00:13:34,125 --> 00:13:36,875
<i>and as she tried to slip away</i>
<i>without drawing attention</i>

385
00:13:36,917 --> 00:13:38,834
<i>to herself, she was</i>
<i>once again approached...</i>

386
00:13:38,875 --> 00:13:40,667
-Cindy Featherbottom.
<i>-...by the</i> man whose name she
<i>never got.</i>

387
00:13:40,709 --> 00:13:42,083
Here's my private number.

388
00:13:42,125 --> 00:13:43,500
Give me a call;
perhaps we can engage

389
00:13:43,542 --> 00:13:46,041
-in some sexual congress.
<i>-Although that's</i>

390
00:13:46,083 --> 00:13:47,959
<i>a total giveaway, right?</i>

391
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,542
What a wonderful sense of humor.

392
00:13:50,583 --> 00:13:52,583
I'd like that very much.

393
00:13:52,625 --> 00:13:54,417
Sir, the press awaits.

394
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:55,709
Now, I don't know what this nut
was protesting tonight.

395
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:57,041
I thought you were supposed
to be sticking it

396
00:13:57,083 --> 00:13:58,750
to the man,
not the other way around.

397
00:13:58,792 --> 00:14:00,083
Maeby.

398
00:14:00,125 --> 00:14:01,667
You think he likes me that way?

399
00:14:01,709 --> 00:14:04,041
No, Mom, that's Herbert Love,

400
00:14:04,083 --> 00:14:05,041
the man you're here to protest.

401
00:14:05,083 --> 00:14:06,291
And I hear the guy with the bomb

402
00:14:06,333 --> 00:14:07,500
snuck up here from Mexico.

403
00:14:07,542 --> 00:14:08,500
That's why I say,

404
00:14:08,542 --> 00:14:11,834
we have got to build a wall

405
00:14:11,875 --> 00:14:14,041
-between us and Mexico.
-Oh, no.

406
00:14:14,083 --> 00:14:15,959
H-How could you not
recognize him?

407
00:14:16,041 --> 00:14:18,125
NARRATOR:<i> In fairness</i>
<i>to Lindsay, it was Marky's</i>

408
00:14:18,166 --> 00:14:21,000
<i>face-blindness that led him</i>
<i>to mistake this photo</i>

409
00:14:21,041 --> 00:14:22,208
<i>for the candidate.</i>

410
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:23,917
<i>Why Lindsay failed to recognize</i>

411
00:14:23,959 --> 00:14:27,750
<i>musical icon Nat King Cole</i>
<i>cannot be explained.</i>

412
00:14:27,792 --> 00:14:29,834
But he's so modern looking.

413
00:14:29,875 --> 00:14:31,667
I mean, obviously I didn't know
it was the man

414
00:14:31,709 --> 00:14:33,625
whose politics
I'm here to protest.

415
00:14:33,667 --> 00:14:34,834
I guess I was just having fun,

416
00:14:34,875 --> 00:14:36,667
pretending I had
my old life back.

417
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:38,333
Well, we'll just be friends,
and I'm gonna keep it

418
00:14:38,375 --> 00:14:40,959
light and fun with him
and not talk politics at all.

419
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,959
I can't believe
you're such a sellout.

420
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,709
-(sighs) 
-Are you really going
to whore yourself out like that?

421
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:47,709
-I am not a whore.
-Yeah, you're a whore.

422
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:48,834
I am not a whore.

423
00:14:48,875 --> 00:14:50,083
Look, I am still committed
to my ideals

424
00:14:50,125 --> 00:14:52,375
and to my Marky.

425
00:14:52,417 --> 00:14:53,792
MARKY:
Lindsay!

426
00:14:53,834 --> 00:14:55,375
Lindsay, Lindsay!

427
00:14:55,417 --> 00:14:56,834
Well, you certainly have a type.

428
00:14:56,875 --> 00:14:58,458
Lindsay? Have you seen a
woman named Lindsay?

429
00:14:58,500 --> 00:14:59,625
If you see a woman
named Lindsay,

430
00:14:59,667 --> 00:15:02,208
tell her to bail me out.

431
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:03,875
(gravelly):
I'll do my best, sir.

432
00:15:03,917 --> 00:15:05,083
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

433
00:15:05,125 --> 00:15:06,542
(gravelly):
Taxi.

434
00:15:06,583 --> 00:15:08,166
Tell Lindsay to feed Cindy.

435
00:15:08,208 --> 00:15:09,250
-She thinks she's...
-(in normal voice): Taxi.

436
00:15:09,291 --> 00:15:11,000
(elevator bell dings)

437
00:15:11,041 --> 00:15:14,000
NARRATOR:<i> Lindsay was</i>
<i>as blue as one of her men</i>

438
00:15:14,041 --> 00:15:16,625
<i>when she returned</i>
<i>to the penthouse,</i>

439
00:15:16,667 --> 00:15:21,000
<i>and that's when she decided</i>
<i>to get half in the bag.</i>

440
00:15:21,041 --> 00:15:23,667
<i>-But even though she felt</i>
<i>bad.</i> .. 
-(elevator bell dings)

441
00:15:23,709 --> 00:15:26,208
<i>...she was at least able</i>
<i>to turn a man's head...</i>

442
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:27,917
Gentlemen, start your engines.

443
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:29,583
<i>...although, perhaps had</i>
<i>his head not turned...</i>

444
00:15:29,625 --> 00:15:31,208
-Buster.
<i>-...he would have seen</i>

445
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:32,583
<i>-the ostrich warning</i>
on the door. -No, Gob.

446
00:15:32,625 --> 00:15:33,875
-(ostrich screeches)
-Oh!

447
00:15:33,917 --> 00:15:35,417
NARRATOR:
<i>After another night</i>

448
00:15:35,458 --> 00:15:38,583
<i>in the trailer,</i>
<i>Lindsay went to the model home</i>

449
00:15:38,625 --> 00:15:40,166
<i>to give a daughter</i>
<i>who called her a whore</i>

450
00:15:40,208 --> 00:15:41,667
<i>a piece of her mind.</i>

451
00:15:41,709 --> 00:15:44,083
Hi, sweetie.

452
00:15:44,125 --> 00:15:46,208
<i>Of course, she needed a place</i>
<i>to stay, so she couldn't</i>

453
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:48,583
<i>-just jump right in. </i>
-I thought I'd surprise you with
a visit.

454
00:15:48,625 --> 00:15:50,875
Yeah, well, the bags are
certainly a surprise.

455
00:15:50,917 --> 00:15:52,166
You're not thinking
of moving in, are you?

456
00:15:52,208 --> 00:15:54,208
-What? No.
-Yeah, because

457
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:55,500
I don't think
Dad would be cool with it.

458
00:15:55,542 --> 00:15:56,959
-No, of course not.
-Yeah.

459
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,917
-Is he in?
-No.

460
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:02,834
(sighs)
Oh, what happened there?

461
00:16:02,875 --> 00:16:05,458
Kids or people who like kids.

462
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:06,959
So, where's Marky?

463
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,709
God, Marky will be
in jail for quite a while.

464
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:12,417
NARRATOR:<i> She actually had just</i>
<i>come from visiting him.</i>

465
00:16:12,458 --> 00:16:15,709
So it, uh, turns out
the glitter was shrapnel grade.

466
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:17,750
They're upping my charges

467
00:16:17,792 --> 00:16:21,125
from prank bomb
to non-Arab terrorism.

468
00:16:21,166 --> 00:16:22,542
This is where
you letting me out

469
00:16:22,583 --> 00:16:23,667
of the podium
would have really helped.

470
00:16:23,709 --> 00:16:25,166
Why didn't you just come out?

471
00:16:25,208 --> 00:16:27,083
I couldn't do it;
someone locked me in.

472
00:16:27,125 --> 00:16:28,500
NARRATOR:
<i>In fact, it was Gob,</i>

473
00:16:28,542 --> 00:16:31,166
<i>thinking he was trapping</i>
<i>the magician Tony Wonder</i>

474
00:16:31,208 --> 00:16:32,583
<i>into one of his illusions.</i>

475
00:16:32,625 --> 00:16:34,166
GOB:
<i>Hey, Mark, you guys want to see</i>

476
00:16:34,208 --> 00:16:35,417
a real failed magician,
you might want

477
00:16:35,458 --> 00:16:36,542
to get down to the Opies
tonight.

478
00:16:36,583 --> 00:16:38,166
It's going to be hysterical.

479
00:16:38,208 --> 00:16:39,583
MARKY:<i> I need you</i>
<i>to bail me out, Lindsay.</i>

480
00:16:39,625 --> 00:16:41,166
-I need you to use that check.
-Oh, I...

481
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:42,458
I don't have that check anymore.

482
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:44,583
-What?
-You told me to rip it up.

483
00:16:44,625 --> 00:16:46,041
I thought you said you
didn't believe in money.

484
00:16:46,083 --> 00:16:47,375
I didn't until I realized
what it could keep me from.

485
00:16:47,417 --> 00:16:49,000
Jail's a lot like Swappigans,

486
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:51,250
except there's only
one thing to swap.

487
00:16:51,291 --> 00:16:52,583
It's scary.

488
00:16:52,625 --> 00:16:53,875
-GUARD: Anus tart.
-TOBIAS: Yep, that's me. 

489
00:16:53,917 --> 00:16:56,083
-MARKY: Oh, God,
that could have been me.

490
00:16:56,125 --> 00:16:58,250
Lindsay, listen to me--
I'm scared.

491
00:16:58,291 --> 00:16:59,417
I'm scared,
I'm scared, I'm scared.

492
00:16:59,458 --> 00:17:01,083
-I'm really scared.
-GUARD: No touching.

493
00:17:01,125 --> 00:17:02,333
LINDSAY:
<i>Actually it's kind of nice</i>

494
00:17:02,375 --> 00:17:04,125
to have a little me time.

495
00:17:04,166 --> 00:17:06,083
Oh, of course, that's why
you were giving Herbert Love

496
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:08,333
a little you time last night.

497
00:17:08,375 --> 00:17:10,667
You were flirting with him
to get Marky out of jail.

498
00:17:10,709 --> 00:17:12,250
Well, yeah, that is

499
00:17:12,291 --> 00:17:16,667
what I should have been do--
what I did, yeah, yeah.

500
00:17:16,709 --> 00:17:18,834
That's exactly
what I should have and did do.

501
00:17:18,875 --> 00:17:22,000
And it's not that bad an idea,
actually.

502
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:23,834
You could get him to do anything
'cause he's probably

503
00:17:23,875 --> 00:17:26,041
just one of those shallow guys
who's only interested in looks.

504
00:17:26,083 --> 00:17:27,709
I miss that.

505
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:29,000
Missed that.

506
00:17:29,041 --> 00:17:30,375
Yeah, you know,
maybe it would be

507
00:17:30,417 --> 00:17:32,583
a good idea if I got
in touch with him.

508
00:17:32,625 --> 00:17:35,750
I mean, he did give me his card.

509
00:17:35,792 --> 00:17:37,750
Although I could never call him.

510
00:17:37,792 --> 00:17:39,750
I could call him for you

511
00:17:39,792 --> 00:17:41,875
and I'll tell him
it has to be tonight.

512
00:17:41,917 --> 00:17:43,792
Well, the sooner the better.

513
00:17:43,834 --> 00:17:45,083
Got to get Marky out of jail.

514
00:17:45,125 --> 00:17:47,125
That's why the sooner
the better.

515
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:49,125
NARRATOR:<i> So Maeby arranged</i>
<i>for a meeting</i>

516
00:17:49,166 --> 00:17:51,792
<i>that evening at Hollywood's</i>
<i>exclusive Ealing Club</i>

517
00:17:51,834 --> 00:17:53,750
<i>between Herbert Love</i>
<i>and Cindy Featherbottom.</i>

518
00:17:53,792 --> 00:17:56,000
I like this place.

519
00:17:56,041 --> 00:17:58,542
No cameras, no phones.

520
00:17:58,583 --> 00:17:59,917
Everyone's cool.

521
00:17:59,959 --> 00:18:02,166
Well, thank you
for being willing to meet.

522
00:18:02,208 --> 00:18:03,542
Meet, greet.

523
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:05,166
Sure are sweet.

524
00:18:05,208 --> 00:18:06,250
What a treat.

525
00:18:06,291 --> 00:18:07,959
What did the lamb say?

526
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,041
Baa?

527
00:18:10,083 --> 00:18:11,041
Bleat.

528
00:18:11,083 --> 00:18:12,417
Ah, yes, of course.

529
00:18:12,458 --> 00:18:13,917
I was just wondering,

530
00:18:13,959 --> 00:18:15,917
is anything really bad going
to happen

531
00:18:15,959 --> 00:18:18,333
to that blue guy from the rally?

532
00:18:18,375 --> 00:18:19,333
Do you want to press charges?

533
00:18:19,375 --> 00:18:21,166
Who can think of Little Boy Blue

534
00:18:21,208 --> 00:18:24,125
-when I've got this beautiful
face in front of me? 
-Oh.

535
00:18:24,166 --> 00:18:26,959
Thanks, haven't heard that
in a long time.

536
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,375
Your cheekbones are even higher
than my approval rating.

537
00:18:29,417 --> 00:18:31,875
Your brain can register
my cheekbones?

538
00:18:31,917 --> 00:18:33,458
I'll register 'em to vote.

539
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:35,917
-(laughs) 
-Your lips arelike a Murphy bed.

540
00:18:35,959 --> 00:18:37,166
They don't take up much space,

541
00:18:37,208 --> 00:18:39,125
but they are there
when you need 'em.

542
00:18:39,166 --> 00:18:43,208
Okay, you are a poet.

543
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:46,417
You're wonderful.

544
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:48,250
But, um, yeah,
I-I do want to talk

545
00:18:48,291 --> 00:18:50,125
to you about a couple of issues.

546
00:18:50,166 --> 00:18:54,458
Can we just have one night where
we don't talk about politics?

547
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:57,375
Yes, yes, just one night.

548
00:18:57,417 --> 00:18:58,959
-We deserve it.
-Let's get a room.

549
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,166
Yes-- no.

550
00:19:00,208 --> 00:19:01,166
What?

551
00:19:01,208 --> 00:19:03,208
Uh, I... okay.

552
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:04,875
We can talk in a room, I guess.

553
00:19:04,917 --> 00:19:06,667
(elevator bell dings)

554
00:19:06,709 --> 00:19:08,750
NARRATOR:<i> And later,</i>
<i>down in the lobby, as Herbert</i>

555
00:19:08,792 --> 00:19:10,625
<i>went off to do some business...</i>

556
00:19:10,667 --> 00:19:12,417
You hang tight.

557
00:19:12,458 --> 00:19:15,083
I'm going to meet with some
of my, uh, "constititutes."

558
00:19:15,125 --> 00:19:16,375
<i>...Lindsay ran</i>
<i>into her brother Michael.</i>

559
00:19:16,417 --> 00:19:18,083
-Hi-lo.
-Michael?

560
00:19:18,125 --> 00:19:19,208
Hi.

561
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:20,792
-How are you?
-Oh, good, good.

562
00:19:20,834 --> 00:19:22,250
I almost didn't recognize you.

563
00:19:22,291 --> 00:19:23,709
-It's my hair.
-That's some of it,

564
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:25,500
but it's also, you're with a guy

565
00:19:25,542 --> 00:19:27,792
that pretty much represents
everything you pretend to hate.

566
00:19:27,834 --> 00:19:29,458
-Was that Herbert Love?
-Great, now I remember

567
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:31,166
why we fell out of touch.

568
00:19:31,208 --> 00:19:33,291
No, Lindsay, I'm kidding,
kidding, kidding, I'm so sorry.

569
00:19:33,333 --> 00:19:34,583
I'm sure that you're having
a great influence

570
00:19:34,625 --> 00:19:36,250
on him, you know.

571
00:19:36,291 --> 00:19:37,875
(chuckling):
Thanks.

572
00:19:37,917 --> 00:19:40,583
But if you really want
to blow him-- away,

573
00:19:40,625 --> 00:19:44,333
you know the wall issue
that everyone is talking about?

574
00:19:44,375 --> 00:19:46,166
The wall between Mexico
and the U.S.?

575
00:19:46,208 --> 00:19:47,625
Tell him to take it down?

576
00:19:47,667 --> 00:19:50,083
Or just not to put it up.
No wall yet.

577
00:19:50,125 --> 00:19:52,041
Oh, no, there's no--
I knew that, yeah.

578
00:19:52,083 --> 00:19:53,834
If you could get him

579
00:19:53,875 --> 00:19:56,000
against the wall, Lindsay...

580
00:19:56,041 --> 00:19:58,417
Well, I had no idea you were
this socially conscious.

581
00:19:58,458 --> 00:20:00,125
NARRATOR:
<i>He wasn't.</i>

582
00:20:00,166 --> 00:20:02,542
<i>In fact, he was just using</i>
<i>her Love connection</i>

583
00:20:02,583 --> 00:20:05,291
<i>to make good</i>
<i>on a deal he'd struck</i>

584
00:20:05,333 --> 00:20:07,375
<i>to get</i>
<i>his father's movie rights.</i>

585
00:20:07,417 --> 00:20:09,875
Can you help me,
then, with Love?

586
00:20:09,917 --> 00:20:11,917
Of course I will.

587
00:20:13,709 --> 00:20:15,667
If you do something for me.

588
00:20:15,709 --> 00:20:17,291
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

589
00:20:17,333 --> 00:20:19,500
I would like to use your
membership at the Balboa Club.

590
00:20:19,542 --> 00:20:21,208
The girl
I've been telling you about--

591
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:23,625
she likes nice things, and
if everything goes well tonight,

592
00:20:23,667 --> 00:20:25,500
I think I may want
to take her out

593
00:20:25,542 --> 00:20:26,500
for a nice dinner.

594
00:20:26,542 --> 00:20:28,625
You really like this girl?

595
00:20:28,667 --> 00:20:30,750
-She's Tracey.
-Oh.

596
00:20:30,792 --> 00:20:34,000
Fat Tracey
or thin Tracey at the end?

597
00:20:34,041 --> 00:20:36,125
I think, just on this,
you owe me the membership.

598
00:20:36,166 --> 00:20:37,583
You know,
we're kind of maxed out

599
00:20:37,625 --> 00:20:39,834
at the club,
but if you show them my card,

600
00:20:39,875 --> 00:20:44,417
I'm sure they won't turn you
away at the door.

601
00:20:44,458 --> 00:20:46,417
You'd do this for me?

602
00:20:46,458 --> 00:20:48,041
I will if you...

603
00:20:48,083 --> 00:20:50,583
-Yeah, sure, fine.
-Yeah?

604
00:20:50,625 --> 00:20:52,792
Yeah, I'll talk to him
about the wall.

605
00:20:52,834 --> 00:20:54,917
-Good. 
-I mean, I want to change
politics.

606
00:20:54,959 --> 00:20:57,166
-Great.
-What's in it for me?

607
00:20:57,208 --> 00:20:59,041
So not completely change them?

608
00:20:59,083 --> 00:21:00,166
(chuckles)
What do you want?

609
00:21:00,208 --> 00:21:01,500
Well, actually

610
00:21:01,542 --> 00:21:02,875
I want you to talk
to that warden guy

611
00:21:02,917 --> 00:21:04,917
about getting my boyfriend out

612
00:21:04,959 --> 00:21:07,250
'cause I really don't think
Herbert's gonna help with that.

613
00:21:07,291 --> 00:21:09,083
Well, I have a script notes call
with him on Tuesday.

614
00:21:10,917 --> 00:21:12,709
-Yeah, I'll talk to
WardenGentles. 
-Great, thank you.

615
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:14,166
This is good.

616
00:21:14,208 --> 00:21:15,959
-Of course.
-Glad we ran into each other.

617
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,375
If you do something for me.

618
00:21:17,417 --> 00:21:19,750
I'm making this movie and I need
everybody's rights.

619
00:21:19,792 --> 00:21:21,834
NARRATOR:
<i>And that's how Lindsay agreed</i>

620
00:21:21,875 --> 00:21:24,834
<i>-to give Michael her rights</i>
<i>forhis movie. </i>
- I'll do it.  
-Great.

621
00:21:24,875 --> 00:21:25,834
Thanks.

622
00:21:25,875 --> 00:21:27,417
That's it.

623
00:21:27,458 --> 00:21:29,333
NARRATOR:
<i>But it shouldn't have been</i>

624
00:21:29,375 --> 00:21:31,625
<i>because he should have asked</i>
<i>for help getting into a club</i>

625
00:21:31,667 --> 00:21:34,375
<i>he was about to discover</i>
<i>was members only.</i>

626
00:21:34,417 --> 00:21:36,166
-This is a membership place,
huh?  
-It is,

627
00:21:36,208 --> 00:21:38,750
-yes, members only. 
-Yeah,I'm meeting 
my son up there.

628
00:21:38,792 --> 00:21:40,625
Maybe he's already up there.
Could you maybe page him

629
00:21:40,667 --> 00:21:44,000
-up there? 
<i>-And when the page </i>
<i>proved fruitless...</i>

630
00:21:44,041 --> 00:21:45,583
If you'd like
to have a seat and wait...

631
00:21:45,625 --> 00:21:47,333
You're gonna make me look like
a big shot in front of my son.

632
00:21:47,375 --> 00:21:49,959
<i>Michael decided to head</i>
<i>George Michael off</i>

633
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:54,166
<i>before he could get to the</i>
<i>club's lobby with a small lie.</i>

634
00:21:54,208 --> 00:21:55,750
Hey, buddy, it's Dad.

635
00:21:55,792 --> 00:21:58,875
Um, I am having real trouble
getting up there.

636
00:21:58,917 --> 00:22:01,458
Uh, this traffic
is unbelievable.

637
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:03,458
NARRATOR:<i> Which led</i>
<i>to a slightly bigger lie...</i>

638
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:06,875
We got a light aircraft right
in the middle of the freeway.
You know?

639
00:22:06,917 --> 00:22:08,875
<i>-...and then some</i>
<i>effort to make it foolproof.</i>

640
00:22:08,917 --> 00:22:11,500
Um, and, uh, the kicker
is that there's no news crew.

641
00:22:11,542 --> 00:22:14,792
I mean, I guess they can't get
in either 'cause of the traffic,

642
00:22:14,834 --> 00:22:16,583
so no one's going
to be able to see this.

643
00:22:16,625 --> 00:22:17,625
NARRATOR:
<i>But perhaps,</i>

644
00:22:17,667 --> 00:22:19,500
<i>had Michael not have lied,</i>

645
00:22:19,542 --> 00:22:22,250
<i>he wouldn't have felt</i>
<i>suspicious when, moments later,</i>

646
00:22:22,291 --> 00:22:24,083
<i>-he received a return call</i>
<i>from his son... </i>
-You know what?

647
00:22:24,125 --> 00:22:27,000
<i>I bet we're sitting</i>
<i>in the exact same traffic.</i>
<i>This is a mess.</i>

648
00:22:27,041 --> 00:22:29,083
<i>...canceling the get-together</i>
<i>entirely.</i>

649
00:22:29,125 --> 00:22:31,875
<i>Oh, God, they're forcing us off.</i>
<i>Oh, they're closing the lanes.</i>

650
00:22:31,917 --> 00:22:33,875
NARRATOR:<i> Meanwhile,</i>
<i>in Herbert's hotel room,</i>

651
00:22:33,917 --> 00:22:35,458
<i>Lindsay was worried she was</i>

652
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:37,750
<i>too quickly abandoning</i>
<i>her principles.</i>

653
00:22:37,792 --> 00:22:39,959
Wait... I can't do this

654
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,250
unless you promise
to be against the wall.

655
00:22:43,291 --> 00:22:45,166
What the hell?

656
00:22:45,208 --> 00:22:46,417
It's better for my back anyway.

657
00:22:46,458 --> 00:22:52,250
Thank you.

658
00:22:52,291 --> 00:22:54,083
That was so not quick.

659
00:22:54,125 --> 00:22:55,083
(chuckles)

660
00:22:55,125 --> 00:22:56,208
Well, I paid for six hours.

661
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:57,959
I want to get my money's worth.

662
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,500
Imagine what would have happened
if you had the room

663
00:22:59,542 --> 00:23:00,917
for the whole night.

664
00:23:00,959 --> 00:23:02,458
Oh, I got it
for the whole month.

665
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:04,542
You crack me up.

666
00:23:04,583 --> 00:23:06,500
God, can you believe
this is happening?

667
00:23:06,542 --> 00:23:08,834
I mean, we're such opposites
and yet we're so in synch.

668
00:23:08,875 --> 00:23:11,834
-It's like we finish
each other's... 
-Sandwiches?

669
00:23:11,875 --> 00:23:14,291
What's the point of raising
funds if I'm eating sandwiches?

670
00:23:14,333 --> 00:23:16,709
-(murmurs)
-I got something for you.

671
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:18,709
(chuckling):
Oh, really?

672
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:21,250
(gasping)

673
00:23:21,291 --> 00:23:23,875
NARRATOR:<i> And perhaps it was</i>
<i>the heart that made her wonder</i>

674
00:23:23,917 --> 00:23:27,875
<i>if Herbert was the Love the</i>
<i>Four Seasons shaman spoke of.</i>

675
00:23:27,917 --> 00:23:31,208
When love is near,
your heart will be happy.

676
00:23:31,250 --> 00:23:32,458
HERBERT:
<i>This way</i>

677
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:35,625
you'll always have a little Love
near your heart.

678
00:23:35,667 --> 00:23:37,792
(mystical chanting)

679
00:23:37,834 --> 00:23:39,959
-Aah, Jesus Christ!
-Oh!

680
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,250
-I'm sorry.
-Why would you do that?

681
00:23:41,291 --> 00:23:42,959
No, I thought it was cute,
I saw it in a movie.

682
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,041
-Okay?
-Okay, okay, great, thank you.

683
00:23:44,083 --> 00:23:45,583
Oh, I feel so special.

684
00:23:45,625 --> 00:23:46,959
You are special.

685
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,750
NARRATOR:
<i>Lindsay wasn't special,</i>

686
00:23:48,792 --> 00:23:51,500
<i>but he'd gotten</i>
<i>the necklaces on special.</i>

687
00:23:51,542 --> 00:23:52,959
LINDSAY:
<i>So, when can I see you</i>

688
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,667
-again?
-The only way

689
00:23:54,709 --> 00:23:57,750
we can see each other is
if you work for my campaign.

690
00:23:57,792 --> 00:24:01,333
You are going to be
my key advisor.

691
00:24:01,375 --> 00:24:03,875
NARRATOR:<i> She would be enacting</i>
<i>social change after all.</i>

692
00:24:03,917 --> 00:24:05,458
I would like that very much.

693
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:06,750
(Herbert chuckles)

694
00:24:06,792 --> 00:24:07,959
She's going to need a key
to my room,

695
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,750
and I'd advise you to use it
when I call you.

696
00:24:13,959 --> 00:24:16,083
NARRATOR:<i> Since Herbert couldn't</i>
<i>officially spend money</i>

697
00:24:16,125 --> 00:24:17,750
<i>on Lindsay, and Lindsay</i>
<i>hadn't told Herbert</i>

698
00:24:17,792 --> 00:24:19,750
<i>-who she really was... </i>
-Uh, why don't you go

699
00:24:19,792 --> 00:24:21,375
-make the rounds, and, uh,
I'll get us checked in. 
-Okay.

700
00:24:21,417 --> 00:24:22,917
<i>...Lindsay had to pay</i>
<i>for dinner</i>

701
00:24:22,959 --> 00:24:24,583
<i>-the way she always had... </i>
-Uh, Bluth.

702
00:24:24,625 --> 00:24:26,917
-I made a reservation.
<i>-...by secretly putting it</i>

703
00:24:26,959 --> 00:24:28,500
<i>-on her family tab. </i>
-Hi-lo. Nice to meet you.

704
00:24:28,542 --> 00:24:30,000
Oh, I'm sorry,
the Bluths have been seated.

705
00:24:30,041 --> 00:24:31,917
<i>But she wasn't the only Bluth</i>

706
00:24:31,959 --> 00:24:33,458
<i>pretending to be something</i>
<i>they weren't that night.</i>

707
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:36,500
Who's the cheap redhead?

708
00:24:36,542 --> 00:24:39,083
Well, hello.

709
00:24:39,125 --> 00:24:40,417
Hello.

710
00:24:40,458 --> 00:24:41,709
Indeed.

711
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:44,083
Look at you.
What are you doing here?

712
00:24:44,125 --> 00:24:46,750
I need the membership. I'm
taking my boss out to dinner.

713
00:24:46,792 --> 00:24:48,667
It's too late. I already made
a deal with Dad for it.

714
00:24:48,709 --> 00:24:50,917
This is why I had to ask you
for the in with Herbert Love.

715
00:24:50,959 --> 00:24:53,000
Exactly, and that's why
you are leaving,

716
00:24:53,041 --> 00:24:54,917
and I'm going to stay because
I'm the one who did the favor.

717
00:24:54,959 --> 00:24:56,792
I got Love against the wall.
Plus I've got to impress him.

718
00:24:56,834 --> 00:24:58,959
He's making me part
of his campaign.

719
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,667
I'm sorry, there seems
to have been a mix-up.

720
00:25:00,709 --> 00:25:02,333
-A merry one.
-Oh.

721
00:25:02,375 --> 00:25:05,041
A merry one. I already paid you
back for the favor when

722
00:25:05,083 --> 00:25:07,083
I talked to the warden about
getting Marky out of prison.

723
00:25:07,125 --> 00:25:08,583
LINDSAY:
Oh, God, not now.

724
00:25:08,625 --> 00:25:10,250
-When?
-I don't know, but listen.

725
00:25:10,291 --> 00:25:11,834
I haven't been on a date
in a very, very long time,

726
00:25:11,875 --> 00:25:13,250
and she's already going out
with Ron Howard

727
00:25:13,291 --> 00:25:14,709
so I need to impress her.

728
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:16,458
<i>Actually,</i>
<i>it was Ron's daughter,</i>

729
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:18,000
<i>but Michael still didn't</i>
<i>know that.</i>

730
00:25:18,041 --> 00:25:20,333
Great to see you.
And you look so good.

731
00:25:20,375 --> 00:25:21,583
So do you.
I do hate the campaign,

732
00:25:21,625 --> 00:25:23,834
okay, but I'm changing him.

733
00:25:23,875 --> 00:25:25,083
I'm his key advisor.

734
00:25:25,125 --> 00:25:26,917
<i>Although without an office,</i>

735
00:25:26,959 --> 00:25:29,333
<i>she was forced to advise him</i>
<i>in the back of his limo.</i>

736
00:25:29,375 --> 00:25:31,792
<i>And soon she was advising him</i>
<i>all over town.</i>

737
00:25:31,834 --> 00:25:33,500
LINDSAY:
<i>And he respect me for it.</i>

738
00:25:33,542 --> 00:25:35,208
He respects me for who I am.

739
00:25:35,250 --> 00:25:36,875
So does mine.
Listen, we'll share it, okay?

740
00:25:36,917 --> 00:25:38,583
-Okay.
-Got it? Great.

741
00:25:38,625 --> 00:25:40,542
Oh! My name
is Cindy Featherbottom.

742
00:25:40,583 --> 00:25:42,834
Right. Oh, and I-I used to be
a real estate tycoon,

743
00:25:42,875 --> 00:25:44,709
now I'm an impressive producer.
Got it?

744
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:46,000
-Got it.
-Eat light.

745
00:25:46,041 --> 00:25:48,959
This is my date.
This is Rebel Alley.

746
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,709
Oh, and my boss, Herbert Love.

747
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:53,000
-Hi-lo.
-Hi-lo?

748
00:25:53,041 --> 00:25:54,875
Just like your plan
to hurt the poor.

749
00:25:54,917 --> 00:25:57,625
I thought that was about
neglecting the poor.

750
00:25:57,667 --> 00:25:59,750
I guess the special tonight
is red snapper.

751
00:25:59,792 --> 00:26:01,709
How do you know this woman?

752
00:26:02,959 --> 00:26:07,250
Uh, she is... um...

753
00:26:09,583 --> 00:26:11,125
-I just, I mean...
-(Lindsay laughs)

754
00:26:11,166 --> 00:26:13,000
-High school.
-Brother and sister.

755
00:26:13,041 --> 00:26:14,625
We can't be brother-sister--
she knows about the family.

756
00:26:14,667 --> 00:26:16,542
-We don't.
-Just met.

757
00:26:16,583 --> 00:26:18,417
Yeah, so, but let's eat.

758
00:26:18,458 --> 00:26:20,125
NARRATOR:<i> And that's how Lindsay</i>
<i>found herself</i>

759
00:26:20,166 --> 00:26:23,542
<i>on a very awkward double date</i>
<i>with her brother.</i>

760
00:26:23,583 --> 00:26:26,542
Is everybody's food as delicious
as my side salad?

761
00:26:26,583 --> 00:26:28,750
<i>And a couple of glasses</i>
<i>of white wine in,</i>

762
00:26:28,792 --> 00:26:31,542
<i>Rebel started to espouse</i>
<i>her liberal agenda.</i>

763
00:26:31,583 --> 00:26:33,583
It's just a little hard to sit
two feet away from someone

764
00:26:33,625 --> 00:26:36,125
who doesn't believe in paying
for a woman's contraception.

765
00:26:36,166 --> 00:26:39,208
Well, to be fair, no,
he does pay for the room.

766
00:26:39,250 --> 00:26:41,917
Is there anything better than
the great American scallop?

767
00:26:41,959 --> 00:26:44,333
Look how he changes the subject.

768
00:26:44,375 --> 00:26:46,542
Aren't you glad your teenager's
not here to see this?

769
00:26:46,583 --> 00:26:47,959
You have a teenager?

770
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,083
I'm a movie prod...

771
00:26:50,125 --> 00:26:52,166
Movie producer.

772
00:26:52,208 --> 00:26:54,542
Producing a movie right now--
Rebel's in it

773
00:26:54,583 --> 00:26:56,834
-for Imagine Entertainment.
-Oh!

774
00:26:56,875 --> 00:26:58,792
Is that Ron Howard's company?

775
00:26:58,834 --> 00:27:00,583
-Uh, yeah.
-Yes.

776
00:27:00,625 --> 00:27:02,959
I don't want to be the one
to say it, but I hate that guy.

777
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,792
He's just another Hollywood
liberal big shot.

778
00:27:05,834 --> 00:27:08,125
Oh. There are a lot of those
Ron Howards out there

779
00:27:08,166 --> 00:27:09,792
that do abuse their power,

780
00:27:09,834 --> 00:27:12,458
but I will tell you, sir,
that I do not do that.

781
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:16,291
Well, don't you have to have
power to abuse the power?

782
00:27:16,333 --> 00:27:19,041
Um, I am not going to sit here
and defend Ron Howard

783
00:27:19,083 --> 00:27:22,792
to someone who's never achieved
half of what he's achieved.

784
00:27:22,834 --> 00:27:24,125
Are you saying that to him
or to me?

785
00:27:24,166 --> 00:27:25,375
I forgot how touchy

786
00:27:25,417 --> 00:27:27,125
these Hollywood people can be.

787
00:27:27,166 --> 00:27:30,125
Oh, I'm not. I'm not.
Are you saying that I am?

788
00:27:30,166 --> 00:27:31,667
Maybe Ron Howard is,
but I-I mean, I don't know.

789
00:27:31,709 --> 00:27:33,834
But I'm not.
And I am also not

790
00:27:33,875 --> 00:27:35,667
one of those Beverly Hills
billionaires

791
00:27:35,709 --> 00:27:37,208
who can't go two minutes without
putting his phone to his...

792
00:27:37,250 --> 00:27:40,834
I got to take this.
Hold on one second. Hello?

793
00:27:40,875 --> 00:27:43,417
Hey, George Michael.
You stuck in traffic, pal?

794
00:27:43,458 --> 00:27:45,625
No, I just feel terrible
that we couldn't get together

795
00:27:45,667 --> 00:27:47,583
the other night and, uh,
I miss you, you know.

796
00:27:47,625 --> 00:27:49,667
But I'm free all night
if you wanted...

797
00:27:49,709 --> 00:27:51,417
-Well... listen, I-I... 

798
00:27:51,458 --> 00:27:53,417
I'm in the middle
of a film meeting...

799
00:27:53,458 --> 00:27:55,917
<i>But Michael was </i>
<i>still stinging over his son not</i>
<i>making it to the Ealing Club...</i>

800
00:27:55,959 --> 00:27:58,000
I've got these people in
politics involved and I just...

801
00:27:58,041 --> 00:28:01,166
You know, I can't get away
this time, you know. Maybe...

802
00:28:01,208 --> 00:28:04,458
<i>...even though Michael</i>
<i>had lied to him about it first.</i>

803
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:05,875
You know, just,
I'm a super busy guy.

804
00:28:05,917 --> 00:28:07,542
So...

805
00:28:07,583 --> 00:28:09,500
I can't believe that a woman
would support this guy.

806
00:28:09,542 --> 00:28:11,333
<i>...Lindsay found herself</i>
<i>torn...</i>

807
00:28:11,375 --> 00:28:14,667
And I assume by being with him,
you just parrot his values.

808
00:28:14,709 --> 00:28:16,959
<i>-...between who she was</i> with...
-I don't appreciate you

809
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,250
saying that, okay?

810
00:28:18,291 --> 00:28:20,166
I have my own values, Rebel,

811
00:28:20,208 --> 00:28:22,417
and believe it or not, they're
closer to yours than you think.

812
00:28:22,458 --> 00:28:24,166
<i>...and who she wanted to be.</i>

813
00:28:24,208 --> 00:28:26,583
'Cause I do appreciate
you saying that.

814
00:28:26,625 --> 00:28:29,250
But what do I know? I'm just
some shallow Hollywood...

815
00:28:29,291 --> 00:28:31,667
Oh, God, I've got to get this.

816
00:28:31,709 --> 00:28:33,834
It could be my agent.
Hello?

817
00:28:33,875 --> 00:28:36,291
HERBERT:
Now that is one redhead

818
00:28:36,333 --> 00:28:38,417
I do not want to have
sexual relations with.

819
00:28:38,458 --> 00:28:39,834
(laughing)

820
00:28:39,875 --> 00:28:42,709
-Well...
-So... are we having dessert?

821
00:28:42,750 --> 00:28:44,500
-No.
-No. Uh-uh.

822
00:28:44,542 --> 00:28:46,000
Well, I don't want to be the one
to say it,

823
00:28:46,041 --> 00:28:47,917
but if we are not going
to have dessert,

824
00:28:47,959 --> 00:28:51,041
-then I think I am going
to leave. 
-Oh, no.

825
00:28:51,083 --> 00:28:53,500
But-but we're going to discuss
those new positions tonight.

826
00:28:53,542 --> 00:28:55,583
Wasn't that the plan?

827
00:28:55,625 --> 00:28:57,709
I think the best position for me
to be in tonight

828
00:28:57,750 --> 00:28:59,583
is with my wife,

829
00:28:59,625 --> 00:29:01,959
and tomorrow I'm taking my wife
and children

830
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,000
to see the beautiful
American ocean.

831
00:29:05,041 --> 00:29:08,166
(diners applauding)

832
00:29:10,458 --> 00:29:14,000
<i>Lindsay started rethinking</i>
<i>her new life and that's when</i>

833
00:29:14,041 --> 00:29:15,667
<i>she ran into the man</i>
<i>from her old one.</i>

834
00:29:15,709 --> 00:29:18,250
-Marky?
-Lindsay?

835
00:29:18,291 --> 00:29:19,875
-Oh, Lindsay.
-Marky.

836
00:29:19,917 --> 00:29:22,750
I did it.
I beat the system.

837
00:29:22,792 --> 00:29:24,208
I got out my way.

838
00:29:24,250 --> 00:29:26,291
I thought my brother asked
Warden Gentles

839
00:29:26,333 --> 00:29:28,625
-to get you out.
-No, I mean from the Dumpster.

840
00:29:28,667 --> 00:29:30,208
You wouldn't believe the
scallops they're throwing

841
00:29:30,250 --> 00:29:32,667
away here, but I got out
of that Dumpster my way.

842
00:29:32,709 --> 00:29:34,542
I've really missed you.

843
00:29:34,583 --> 00:29:37,333
Yeah, I missed you, too.

844
00:29:37,375 --> 00:29:39,834
I feel like I really lost my way
for a while.

845
00:29:39,875 --> 00:29:41,583
Me, too.
It's almost like

846
00:29:41,625 --> 00:29:44,709
maybe we shouldn't skip town
after this next one.

847
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:47,083
Next one? Another paint bomb?

848
00:29:47,125 --> 00:29:48,917
No, a real one.

849
00:29:48,959 --> 00:29:51,792
On the Cinco de Cuatro,
Love's boat is going to...

850
00:29:51,834 --> 00:29:54,583
-Sink-o.
-...go into the... Yes, sink-o.

851
00:29:54,625 --> 00:29:55,959
See, the coast guard is going
to be busy that night,

852
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,667
so after it's done, we slip away

853
00:29:57,709 --> 00:30:00,917
and make our way down to Mexico
and reunite with Mom.

854
00:30:00,959 --> 00:30:02,500
I just have to find a boat
that won't get chorizo

855
00:30:02,542 --> 00:30:04,875
-caught in the propeller.
<i>-Lindsay was torn.</i>

856
00:30:04,917 --> 00:30:07,000
<i>Her head was with Marky...</i>

857
00:30:07,041 --> 00:30:09,750
<i>but it was Love who was close</i>
<i>to her heart.</i>

858
00:30:09,792 --> 00:30:13,750
<i>So the next night at Cinco,</i>
<i>she felt she had no choice</i>

859
00:30:13,792 --> 00:30:15,834
<i>-but to betray one </i>
-Herbert.

860
00:30:15,875 --> 00:30:17,792
<i>-to protect the other. </i>
-Hi. Um, listen.

861
00:30:17,834 --> 00:30:21,125
I'm here undercover because
I have some inside information

862
00:30:21,166 --> 00:30:23,375
that you really need
to know about.

863
00:30:23,417 --> 00:30:24,917
<i>But as it turned out,</i>
<i>Herbert had</i>

864
00:30:24,959 --> 00:30:27,542
<i>some undercover information</i>
<i>for her, too.</i>

865
00:30:27,583 --> 00:30:30,041
I cannot be under the covers
with you anymore.

866
00:30:30,083 --> 00:30:31,792
It's over between us.

867
00:30:31,834 --> 00:30:34,917
My wife found out and I told her
there was nothing emotional,

868
00:30:34,959 --> 00:30:36,333
that you were just a prostitute.

869
00:30:36,375 --> 00:30:39,041
-I'm not a prostitute.
-Oh, I know, I know.

870
00:30:39,083 --> 00:30:40,709
The point is, we are through.

871
00:30:40,750 --> 00:30:41,875
Here's a little
severance package

872
00:30:41,917 --> 00:30:43,583
for servicing my package.

873
00:30:43,625 --> 00:30:46,542
<i>Lindsay tried to throw</i>
<i>the money in his face,</i>

874
00:30:46,583 --> 00:30:49,250
<i>but she didn't have</i>
<i>the muscle memory for it.</i>

875
00:30:50,542 --> 00:30:52,125
-She's keeping it.
-Oh, good.

876
00:30:52,166 --> 00:30:53,750
And don't forget to vote.

877
00:30:53,792 --> 00:30:55,375
This isn't over.

878
00:30:55,417 --> 00:30:57,542
I'm not some taco
you can throw into the bay.

879
00:30:57,583 --> 00:30:59,625
(grunts)

880
00:30:59,667 --> 00:31:02,417
<i>-Lindsay wanted to get back </i>
-I can't do this.

881
00:31:02,458 --> 00:31:03,917
<i>at Love...</i>

882
00:31:03,959 --> 00:31:06,834
<i>but not by blowing him up</i>

883
00:31:06,875 --> 00:31:10,375
<i>and heading to Mexico to be</i>
<i>with Marky's awful mother.</i>

884
00:31:10,417 --> 00:31:14,834
<i>And that's when she ran into</i>
<i>her own awful mother.</i>

885
00:31:14,875 --> 00:31:17,208
Mom. What are you doing here?

886
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:19,333
Lindsay.
I thought you were a hooker.

887
00:31:19,375 --> 00:31:21,333
-Again.
-It's a wig.

888
00:31:21,375 --> 00:31:22,875
No one recognizes me in it.

889
00:31:22,917 --> 00:31:24,542
Oh, I recognized you.

890
00:31:24,583 --> 00:31:26,291
Let me rephrase that
more kindly.

891
00:31:26,333 --> 00:31:30,083
I hear you're hooking now
with Herbert Love.

892
00:31:30,125 --> 00:31:31,750
-It's called hooking up.
-Oh.

893
00:31:31,792 --> 00:31:33,750
And, yeah,
I got a little sidetracked,

894
00:31:33,792 --> 00:31:36,458
but I know who I am now.

895
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:38,166
I'm back to being
severely liberal.

896
00:31:38,208 --> 00:31:39,792
Well, like I said,

897
00:31:39,834 --> 00:31:41,458
the one time you were nice
enough to visit me,

898
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:43,333
you are who you are--

899
00:31:43,375 --> 00:31:45,542
a blonde, waspy
Orange County princess

900
00:31:45,583 --> 00:31:47,583
who doesn't care about anything
but herself

901
00:31:47,625 --> 00:31:49,500
and that's okay.

902
00:31:49,542 --> 00:31:51,625
Ah, sarcasm.

903
00:31:51,667 --> 00:31:56,000
No, I'm a Bluth
and so are you.

904
00:31:56,041 --> 00:31:58,792
You really know
how to twist the knife.

905
00:31:58,834 --> 00:32:01,125
But you are right about
one thing.

906
00:32:01,166 --> 00:32:02,750
<i>Lindsay was done</i>
<i>pretending to be red.</i>

907
00:32:02,792 --> 00:32:05,458
I don't need this anymore.

908
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:06,917
<i>And she decided the best way</i>
<i>to get back</i>

909
00:32:06,959 --> 00:32:09,291
<i>at her mother</i>
<i>and Herbert Love</i>

910
00:32:09,333 --> 00:32:12,208
<i>was by working</i>
<i>for their mutual rival.</i>

911
00:32:12,250 --> 00:32:15,000
Lucille 2.
I've got great news.

912
00:32:15,041 --> 00:32:18,208
I'm finally available to become
your campaign manager.

913
00:32:18,250 --> 00:32:19,917
Oh, that's lovely, dear.

914
00:32:19,959 --> 00:32:23,208
But I found someone
more qualified than you.

915
00:32:23,250 --> 00:32:24,750
Hello, Lindsay.

916
00:32:24,792 --> 00:32:27,125
Sally.

917
00:32:27,166 --> 00:32:28,667
<i>It was Sally Sitwell, a woman</i>

918
00:32:28,709 --> 00:32:29,917
<i>who'd long been</i>
<i>Lindsay's rival.</i>

919
00:32:29,959 --> 00:32:32,166
-It's been a while.
-Mm.

920
00:32:32,208 --> 00:32:34,417
How is she more qualified
than me?

921
00:32:34,458 --> 00:32:35,959
She has integrity.

922
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,208
And look at this hair.

923
00:32:37,250 --> 00:32:38,875
Look at this beautiful,
long hair.

924
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:42,417
I made you a banner.

925
00:32:42,458 --> 00:32:44,291
Look, I can really help
this campaign.

926
00:32:44,333 --> 00:32:46,625
You already have,
more than you know.

927
00:32:46,667 --> 00:32:50,250
-Now, give her a
littlshow-and-tell.  
-Mm.

928
00:32:50,291 --> 00:32:51,583
Show-and-tell?

929
00:32:51,625 --> 00:32:53,667
Oh, she just means
these photos

930
00:32:53,709 --> 00:32:56,667
of Herbert Love
with a mystery redhead

931
00:32:56,709 --> 00:32:58,291
he's cheating on his wife with.

932
00:32:58,333 --> 00:32:59,959
Who took these?

933
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,667
The first two were taken
by the security camera

934
00:33:01,709 --> 00:33:03,875
in the Albertsons parking lot.

935
00:33:03,917 --> 00:33:06,959
And the third was left in the
photo booth at the Ealing Club.

936
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,792
-God, that was a photo booth?
-Mm-hmm.

937
00:33:09,834 --> 00:33:12,333
No one can know about this.

938
00:33:12,375 --> 00:33:14,208
Oh, I'm afraid
they're going to.

939
00:33:14,250 --> 00:33:17,500
Lucille has copies-- she wants
to go viral with this.

940
00:33:17,542 --> 00:33:18,959
Herbert Love with his hooker?

941
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,917
She'll win for sure.

942
00:33:20,959 --> 00:33:22,417
I can't let her do that.

943
00:33:22,458 --> 00:33:25,625
I don't think you can stop her.

944
00:33:25,667 --> 00:33:27,750
Anyway, it was so great
running into you again.

945
00:33:27,792 --> 00:33:29,542
-Mwah!
<i>-Lindsay was horrified</i>

946
00:33:29,583 --> 00:33:31,750
<i>that the world would view her</i>

947
00:33:31,792 --> 00:33:33,417
<i>-as Love's prostitute. </i>
-Vote for Love. Vote for Love.

948
00:33:33,458 --> 00:33:35,250
<i>And then Lindsay ran into</i>
<i>someone else</i>

949
00:33:35,291 --> 00:33:36,834
<i>-who was looking for Love.</i>
-David. -Who are you?

950
00:33:36,875 --> 00:33:38,083
I'm Cindy Featherbottom.

951
00:33:38,125 --> 00:33:39,834
I've been looking for you.

952
00:33:39,875 --> 00:33:41,709
Love's gone missing
and I've got to find someone

953
00:33:41,750 --> 00:33:44,417
to jump onto that stage
and to show everyone here

954
00:33:44,458 --> 00:33:47,709
that we are the party
that has complete con-con...

955
00:33:47,750 --> 00:33:49,625
Complete con-con-con...

956
00:33:49,667 --> 00:33:51,083
-con-con... Complete...
-...trol?

957
00:33:51,125 --> 00:33:52,750
Giant. ...trol.

958
00:33:52,792 --> 00:33:55,000
<i>And that's when Lindsay</i>
<i>found an opportunity...</i>

959
00:33:55,041 --> 00:33:57,375
-I'll do it.
<i>-to put a spin on the looming</i>

960
00:33:57,417 --> 00:33:59,083
<i>-photos scandal. </i>
-Oh, my God,
thank you, thank you.

961
00:33:59,125 --> 00:34:01,125
And I'm so sorry about
that giant crack earlier.

962
00:34:01,166 --> 00:34:05,417
Okay, raise the mics, everybody!
New speaker!

963
00:34:05,458 --> 00:34:06,959
<i>So, like many before her,</i>

964
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,875
<i>Lindsay would accuse</i>
<i>Herbert Love...</i>

965
00:34:09,917 --> 00:34:11,542
Can I have everyone's attention?

966
00:34:11,583 --> 00:34:14,291
<i>...of sexual harassment.</i>

967
00:34:14,333 --> 00:34:16,917
I am Herbert Love's
"key advisor."

968
00:34:16,959 --> 00:34:19,041
(crowd cheering)

969
00:34:19,083 --> 00:34:20,792
Uh, thank you, but...

970
00:34:20,834 --> 00:34:22,458
<i>But first she had to turn</i>
<i>his supporters against him.</i>

971
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:24,417
Listen, I have a few things
I'd like to tell you

972
00:34:24,458 --> 00:34:26,125
about Herbert Love.

973
00:34:26,166 --> 00:34:28,959
Love wants to put up a wall.

974
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,583
-(cheering)
-No, no.

975
00:34:30,625 --> 00:34:33,041
I mean, not just any wall.

976
00:34:33,083 --> 00:34:36,625
A wall to keep out the Mexicans.

977
00:34:36,667 --> 00:34:38,041
(cheering)

978
00:34:38,083 --> 00:34:41,083
Oh, wow,
what a great crowd, uh...

979
00:34:41,125 --> 00:34:42,333
<i>And that's when</i>
<i>the blowback began.</i>

980
00:34:42,375 --> 00:34:44,959
-Checkmate!
-(angry shouting)

981
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,041
-(crowd cheering)
-But no, you don't understand.

982
00:34:47,083 --> 00:34:49,166
He wants to separate...

983
00:34:49,208 --> 00:34:51,000
Oh! (screams)

984
00:34:51,041 --> 00:34:53,500
<i>-Viva Mongolia. </i>
-That's my necklace.

985
00:34:53,542 --> 00:34:57,792
(angry shouting, clattering)

986
00:34:57,834 --> 00:34:59,625
What-what's going on?

987
00:34:59,667 --> 00:35:01,959
The marauders, lady,
a bunch of young Mexicans--

988
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,166
they're taking over
Cinco de Cuatro.

989
00:35:03,208 --> 00:35:04,959
They don't find it funny
anymore.

990
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:08,250
But that was my necklace.
I mean... God.

991
00:35:08,291 --> 00:35:11,250
They don't belong here,
we belong here.

992
00:35:11,291 --> 00:35:14,542
(cheering)

993
00:35:14,583 --> 00:35:18,291
I mean,
someone should put up a wall.

994
00:35:18,333 --> 00:35:19,917
<i>But that's when Lindsay</i>
<i>found herself</i>

995
00:35:19,959 --> 00:35:21,333
<i>-saying this... </i>
-Yeah.

996
00:35:21,375 --> 00:35:23,583
We should put up a wall.

997
00:35:23,625 --> 00:35:27,083
-Put up this wall.
-(cheering)

998
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:30,458
Put... up... this wall.

999
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:34,333
ALL (chanting):
Put up this wall!

1000
00:35:34,375 --> 00:35:36,500
<i>...which was originally</i>
<i>her mother's idea.</i>

1001
00:35:36,542 --> 00:35:39,875
<i>Although it was horrible news</i>
<i>for her father.</i>

1002
00:35:39,917 --> 00:35:41,917
-Put up this wall!
<i>-And that's when Lindsay</i>

1003
00:35:41,959 --> 00:35:44,041
<i>found out who she really was.</i>

1004
00:35:44,083 --> 00:35:50,417
My name is Lindsay Bluth,
and this is who I am.

1005
00:35:50,458 --> 00:35:52,000
<i>A Bluth,</i>

1006
00:35:52,041 --> 00:35:54,208
-She's a game changer.
<i>-just like her mother.</i>

1008
00:35:59,333 --> 00:36:01,959
<i>Herbert Love is discovered</i>
<i>in a coma.</i>

1009
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,875
They think it happened
during the blowback.

1010
00:36:03,917 --> 00:36:05,792
They found him behind
