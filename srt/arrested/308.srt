00:00:01,209 --> 00:00:02,668
[narrator] 
NOW THE STORY

2
00:00:02,668 --> 00:00:04,379
OF A WEALTHY FAMILY 
WHO LOST EVERYTHING...

3
00:00:04,379 --> 00:00:05,755
AND THE ONE SON 
WHO HAD NO CHOICE...

4
00:00:05,755 --> 00:00:07,340
BUT TO KEEP THEM ALL TOGETHER.

5
00:00:13,721 --> 00:00:15,723
IT'S ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT.

6
00:00:18,393 --> 00:00:20,228
[narrator] 
MICHAEL WAS TRYING TO INCLUDE

7
00:00:20,228 --> 00:00:24,482
HIS BROTHER IN THE BUSINESS, 
AT HIS FATHER'S REQUEST--

8
00:00:24,482 --> 00:00:26,151
- SO, THE LAST COUPLE 
OF MONTHS HAVE SEEN US

9
00:00:26,151 --> 00:00:27,485
HEMORRHAGING MONEY--

10
00:00:27,485 --> 00:00:28,819
[loud pop]

11
00:00:28,819 --> 00:00:30,405
[narrator] 
BUT HE WAS FINDING HIMSELF

12
00:00:30,405 --> 00:00:32,157
OVERWHELMED BY THE CHANGE.

13
00:00:32,157 --> 00:00:34,284
- IS IT MY TURN TO SPEAK YET? 
I'VE GOT A GOOD ONE.

14
00:00:34,284 --> 00:00:36,411
- WE'RE GONNA WAIT TILL 
AFTER LUNCH FOR THE TRICKS.

15
00:00:36,411 --> 00:00:39,039
- IT'S NOT A TRICK, MICHAEL. 
IT'S A BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY.

16
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:40,665
[disco]

17
00:00:40,665 --> 00:00:42,583
YOU CAN TURN THE MUSIC OFF. 
I ALREADY SHOT MY WAD.

18
00:00:42,583 --> 00:00:44,252
OFF.

19
00:00:44,252 --> 00:00:45,670
[Franklin singing]

20
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:46,712
NO, THAT'S 
IT'S A-- TAPE.

21
00:00:46,712 --> 00:00:48,089
[stops]

22
00:00:48,089 --> 00:00:50,925
I HAVE GOT 
A QUICK WAY FOR US...

23
00:00:50,925 --> 00:00:53,928
TO LITERALLY BE SHOWERED 
WITH MONEY.

24
00:00:53,928 --> 00:00:56,097
THAT'S WHERE 
THE PENNY THING WOULD HAVE--

25
00:00:56,097 --> 00:00:58,099
[loud pop]

26
00:00:59,642 --> 00:01:01,936
BONUS. ANYWAY, IT INVOLVES 
US MAKING SOME MONEY...

27
00:01:01,936 --> 00:01:04,647
WITH OUR MEXICAN FRIENDS 
FROM COLOMBIA.

28
00:01:04,647 --> 00:01:06,441
- I THINK THEY'RE CALLED 
COLOMBIANS.

29
00:01:06,441 --> 00:01:08,526
OH, I FORGOT. WE'RE BEING 
"POLITICALLY CORRECT."

30
00:01:08,526 --> 00:01:10,861
[loud pop] 
[glass shattering]

31
00:01:10,861 --> 00:01:12,447
ANYWAY, THERE'S A COMPANY THERE

32
00:01:12,447 --> 00:01:14,365
THAT WANTS TO DEVELOP 
SOME TIME-SHARES WITH US.

33
00:01:14,365 --> 00:01:16,367
I TOLD THEM THAT WE'LL 
SELL THEM OUR BLUEPRINTS...

34
00:01:16,367 --> 00:01:18,035
FOR 100 GRAND.

35
00:01:18,035 --> 00:01:20,080
- GOB, WE'RE PROHIBITED... 
FROM DOING ANY BUSINESS

36
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,248
OUTSIDE THE COUNTRY WHILE 
WE'RE UNDER INVESTIGATION.

37
00:01:22,248 --> 00:01:24,375
- TRANSLATION: 
"WISH I'D THOUGHT OF THAT."

38
00:01:24,375 --> 00:01:26,836
- NICE TRANSLATING, DAD. 
- OH.

39
00:01:26,836 --> 00:01:29,004
I ALSO HAD THIS SLOGAN 
MADE UP.

40
00:01:29,004 --> 00:01:31,841
"A COLOMBIAN CARTEL THAT WON'T 
KIDNAP AND KILL YOU."

41
00:01:31,841 --> 00:01:33,218
UNDERLINE "WON'T," 'CAUSE

42
00:01:33,218 --> 00:01:34,802
THAT MAKES THE COMPETITION 
LOOK LIKE...

43
00:01:34,802 --> 00:01:36,262
MAYBE THEY--

44
00:01:36,262 --> 00:01:37,597
- I'M SERIOUS. 
WE'RE NOT DOING IT.

45
00:01:37,597 --> 00:01:39,056
IT'S ILLEGAL, AND, UH, IT'S ALSO

46
00:01:39,056 --> 00:01:40,641
KIND OF A STUPID WAY 
TO MAKE A QUICK BUCK.

47
00:01:40,641 --> 00:01:41,976
- IT'S NOT STUPID. 
YOU'RE STUPID.

48
00:01:41,976 --> 00:01:43,894
- NICE POUT, DAD.

49
00:01:43,894 --> 00:01:46,397
- I WASN'T CALLING YOU STUPID. 
I WAS CALLING THE IDEA STUPID.

50
00:01:46,397 --> 00:01:47,773
IF YOU'D SPEND 
A LITTLE MORE TIME

51
00:01:47,773 --> 00:01:49,317
LEARNING ABOUT THE BUSINESS...

52
00:01:49,317 --> 00:01:51,194
AND LESS TIME WITH THE TRICKS, 
YOU'D KNOW THAT.

53
00:01:51,194 --> 00:01:53,446
- IF I DIDN'T HAVE A LIVE DOVE 
IN MY PANTS RIGHT NOW,

54
00:01:53,446 --> 00:01:54,947
I WOULD LEAP ACROSS 
THIS TABLE AND--

55
00:01:54,947 --> 00:01:56,491
YOU KNOW WHAT? 
FORGET IT.

56
00:01:56,491 --> 00:01:57,700
- LET'S GO AHEAD AND TAKE FIVE.

57
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:59,410
[narrator] 
MICHAEL WAS FRUSTRATED,

58
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:00,786
[grunting]

59
00:02:00,786 --> 00:02:02,997
AND RETURNED TO HIS OFFICE 
TO FIND LINDSAY.

60
00:02:02,997 --> 00:02:04,415
- GOB IS DRIVING ME CRAZY.

61
00:02:04,415 --> 00:02:06,083
I FINALLY GOT RID OF HIM 
FOR A LITTLE WHILE,

62
00:02:06,083 --> 00:02:07,793
AND DAD PUT HIM 
RIGHT BACK IN THE BUSINESS.

63
00:02:07,793 --> 00:02:09,545
- YOU TWO HAVE ALWAYS FOUGHT.

64
00:02:09,545 --> 00:02:11,088
I THINK I EVEN 
HAVE VIDEO OF THAT.

65
00:02:11,088 --> 00:02:12,673
- YOU AND HALF OF ORANGE COUNTY.

66
00:02:12,673 --> 00:02:14,509
[narrator] 
AS CHILDREN,

67
00:02:14,509 --> 00:02:16,844
GEORGE SR. WOULD OFTEN PROVOKE 
THE BOYS TO FIGHT ONE ANOTHER.

68
00:02:16,844 --> 00:02:18,846
- HE'S CALLING YOU A LIAR.

69
00:02:18,846 --> 00:02:20,265
- I DON'T WANT 
YOUR CARDS, MICHAEL.

70
00:02:20,265 --> 00:02:21,557
- HE'S LYING.

71
00:02:21,557 --> 00:02:22,975
[narrator] 
HE BELIEVED IT CREATED

72
00:02:22,975 --> 00:02:24,602
A COMPETITIVE SPIRIT...

73
00:02:24,602 --> 00:02:26,521
WHICH EQUIPPED THEM 
FOR THE CHALLENGES OF LIFE.

74
00:02:26,521 --> 00:02:27,730
- HEY!

75
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:28,981
LET'S KEEP IT 
IN FRAME.

76
00:02:28,981 --> 00:02:30,441
[narrator] 
HE ALSO BELIEVED FOOTAGE

77
00:02:30,441 --> 00:02:31,942
OF THE TUSSLES WOULD BE 
A BIG HIT...

78
00:02:31,942 --> 00:02:33,778
IN THE BURGEONING 
HOME VIDEO MARKET.

79
00:02:33,778 --> 00:02:37,532
HE SOON FRANCHISED THE CONCEPT 
WITH SUCH TITLES AS...

80
00:02:37,532 --> 00:02:41,035
BOYFIGHTS 2, 
[grunting]

81
00:02:41,035 --> 00:02:42,537
A BOYFIGHTS COOKOUT,

82
00:02:42,537 --> 00:02:44,289
[indistinct]

83
00:02:44,289 --> 00:02:48,000
AND BACKSEAT BOYFIGHTS: 
THE TRIP TO UNCLE JACK'S 70th.

84
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,377
- HOW DO YOU THINK I FEEL?

85
00:02:49,377 --> 00:02:50,711
- YOU WEREN'T EVEN 
IN THE TAPES.

86
00:02:50,711 --> 00:02:52,171
- I WAS TALKING 
ABOUT MY MARRIAGE.

87
00:02:52,171 --> 00:02:53,714
ARE WE STILL TALKING 
ABOUT THE TAPES?

88
00:02:53,714 --> 00:02:55,049
- APPARENTLY NOT.

89
00:02:55,049 --> 00:02:56,634
WHAT'S GOING ON 
WITH YOUR MARRIAGE?

90
00:02:56,634 --> 00:02:58,719
- WELL, AS YOU KNOW, BOB LOBLAW 
AND I HAVE HAD A SECRET

91
00:02:58,719 --> 00:03:00,680
LITTLE THING GOING.

92
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,139
- VERY SECRET. 
HE DOESN'T KNOW.

93
00:03:02,139 --> 00:03:04,642
- HE HAS NOT KNOWN OF IT. 
THAT'S CORRECT.

94
00:03:04,642 --> 00:03:05,976
BUT LAST NIGHT HE FINALLY

95
00:03:05,976 --> 00:03:08,062
RESPONDED TO ONE OF MY 
LITTLE HINTS.

96
00:03:08,062 --> 00:03:09,564
WHY WON'T YOU-- 
[bleeps] ME?

97
00:03:09,564 --> 00:03:10,731
- LOOK-- 
I'M NOT BLIND.

98
00:03:10,731 --> 00:03:12,233
YOU'RE AN ATTRACTIVE WOMAN,

99
00:03:12,233 --> 00:03:14,235
AND YOU'VE BEEN DRESSING 
LIKE A COMMON WHORE.

100
00:03:14,235 --> 00:03:15,861
- WELL, I'VE BEEN TRYING.

101
00:03:15,861 --> 00:03:18,239
- BUT YOU ASKED ME TO REPRESENT 
YOU IN YOUR DIVORCE.

102
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:19,407
I CAN'T SEE A CLIENT.

103
00:03:19,407 --> 00:03:21,867
- THEN RECOMMEND 
SOMEBODY ELSE.

104
00:03:21,867 --> 00:03:23,828
- WELL, OUR COPY BOY 
IS VERY STRIKING,

105
00:03:23,828 --> 00:03:25,871
BUT HE OFTEN HAS TONER 
ON HIS FINGERS.

106
00:03:25,871 --> 00:03:28,833
- I MEANT ANOTHER LAWYER. 
- OH.

107
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:31,001
- SO NOW I HAVE TO TELL TOBIAS 
WE'RE GETTING DIVORCED,

108
00:03:31,001 --> 00:03:32,462
BREAK THE NEWS TO MAEBY,

109
00:03:32,462 --> 00:03:33,921
PLUS FIT AN 
EYEBROW PLUCK IN THERE,

110
00:03:33,921 --> 00:03:34,964
ALL BEFORE THE WEEKEND.

111
00:03:34,964 --> 00:03:36,507
- PERHAPS YOU CAN TALK TO MAEBY

112
00:03:36,507 --> 00:03:38,301
WHILE YOU'RE GETTING 
YOUR EYEBROWS PLUCKED.

113
00:03:38,301 --> 00:03:39,844
IT'LL LOOK LIKE 
YOUR EYES ARE WATERING

114
00:03:39,844 --> 00:03:41,262
'CAUSE YOU'RE SAD.

115
00:03:41,262 --> 00:03:42,847
[narrator] 
LATER THAT DAY MICHAEL WENT

116
00:03:42,847 --> 00:03:44,432
TO HIS PARENTS' APARTMENT...

117
00:03:44,432 --> 00:03:46,351
TO TALK ABOUT THE PROBLEM 
HE WAS HAVING WITH GOB.

118
00:03:46,351 --> 00:03:47,852
- WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

119
00:03:47,852 --> 00:03:49,437
- THEY'RE PAINTING 
THE WHOLE BUILDING,

120
00:03:49,437 --> 00:03:51,564
SO I'M HAVING 
THE INSIDE DONE TOO.

121
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:54,149
AND THAT GOES 
INTO STORAGE, RIGHT?

122
00:03:54,149 --> 00:03:56,944
NOT INTO YOUR APARTMENT. 
- Â¿QUE?

123
00:03:56,944 --> 00:03:59,572
- WHAT'S SPANISH FOR 
"I KNOW YOU SPEAK ENGLISH"?

124
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:01,532
- MOM, IF YOU'RE GONNA SPEAK 
TO THESE GUYS LIKE THIS,

125
00:04:01,532 --> 00:04:03,493
YOU MIGHT WANT TO SLEEP 
WITH ONE EYE OPEN.

126
00:04:03,493 --> 00:04:06,454
- ACTUALLY, I'LL BE 
SLEEPING AT YOUR PLACE.

127
00:04:06,454 --> 00:04:07,955
PAINT FUMES ARE DEADLY.

128
00:04:07,955 --> 00:04:10,291
- YOU KNOW DAD'S 
UNDER HOUSE ARREST HERE.

129
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:12,293
- IT'LL BE NICE TO GET 
A BREAK FROM HIM TOO.

130
00:04:12,293 --> 00:04:15,296
BESIDES, I CERTAINLY 
CAN'T RECUPERATE HERE.

131
00:04:15,296 --> 00:04:18,758
- RECUPERATE? 
- I DIDN'T WANT TO WORRY ANYONE.

132
00:04:18,758 --> 00:04:21,677
IT'S A ROUTINE PROCEDURE-- 
VERY COMMON FOR WOMEN MY AGE.

133
00:04:21,677 --> 00:04:23,513
- I SEE.

134
00:04:23,513 --> 00:04:25,890
THE APARTMENT'S NOT THE ONLY 
THING GETTING A FACE LIFT, HUH?

135
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:27,141
HOPE YOU KEPT YOUR PUNCH CARDS.

136
00:04:27,141 --> 00:04:28,351
YOU'RE ABOUT DUE 
FOR A FREE ONE.

137
00:04:28,351 --> 00:04:29,477
- WE HAVE TO PAY 
FOR THE PAINT.

138
00:04:29,477 --> 00:04:31,396
- NO, NO, NO.

139
00:04:31,396 --> 00:04:33,731
- YOU'RE NOT GETTING A CENTAVO 
UNTIL YOU FINISH ALL THE WORK.

140
00:04:33,731 --> 00:04:35,900
- YOU GUYS ARE BOTH GONNA BE 
SLEEPING WITH YOUR EYES OPEN.

141
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:37,402
MOM, HOWEVER, 
WILL NOT HAVE A CHOICE.

142
00:04:37,402 --> 00:04:38,903
DAD, NEED YOU TO HELP ME 
GET RID OF GOB.

143
00:04:38,903 --> 00:04:40,405
- THAT SHIP SAILED 35 YEARS AGO.

144
00:04:40,405 --> 00:04:42,156
- DOESN'T KNOW ANYTHING 
ABOUT THE BUSINESS.

145
00:04:42,156 --> 00:04:43,449
TODAY HE SUGGESTED

146
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:45,034
THAT WE DO AN ILLEGAL 
COLOMBIAN DEAL.

147
00:04:45,034 --> 00:04:48,203
- YOU SAID THAT WAS LEGAL. 
- THAT WAS YOUR IDEA?

148
00:04:48,203 --> 00:04:49,539
- I MAY HAVE MENTIONED IT.

149
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:52,082
- YOU TOLD GOB TO DO IT, 
DIDN'T YOU?

150
00:04:52,082 --> 00:04:54,377
DID YOU JUST WANT TO GET US AT 
EACH OTHER'S THROATS AGAIN,

151
00:04:54,377 --> 00:04:56,337
LIKE YOU USED TO DO 
WITH THE BOYFIGHTS VIDEOS?

152
00:04:56,337 --> 00:04:57,380
- BOYFIGHTS?

153
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:58,548
- LUCHAS DE MUCHACHOS.

154
00:04:58,548 --> 00:05:00,174
- OH, SI 
LUCHAS DE MUCHACHOS.

155
00:05:00,174 --> 00:05:02,051
- WE HAD THIS VIDEO. 
- SI

156
00:05:02,051 --> 00:05:03,511
[narrator] 
THE TAPES WERE A BIG HIT

157
00:05:03,511 --> 00:05:04,595
IN LATIN AMERICA.

158
00:05:04,595 --> 00:05:05,846
- DON'T LOOK AT ME.

159
00:05:05,846 --> 00:05:07,264
I HAD NOTHING 
TO DO WITH THEM--

160
00:05:07,264 --> 00:05:09,016
EXCEPT FOR SOME 
OF THE BABY BUSTER SHORTS.

161
00:05:09,016 --> 00:05:11,018
- MAYBE I WAS TRYING 
TO TEACH YOU SOMETHING.

162
00:05:11,018 --> 00:05:13,020
MAYBE I WAS TRYING 
TO TEACH YOU HOW TO COMPETE.

163
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:16,023
I DIDN'T DO IT WITH BUSTER, 
AND LOOK HOW HE TURNED OUT.

164
00:05:16,023 --> 00:05:19,527
- IS BUSTER. 
- BABY BUSTER.

165
00:05:19,527 --> 00:05:22,655
- "YO QUIERO LECHE. 
YO QUIERO LECHE DE MADRE."

166
00:05:22,655 --> 00:05:24,990
EVEN THOUGH I AM SO OLD. 
[laughing]

167
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:27,327
- THOSE TAPES MADE QUITE AN 
IMPRESSION ON THESE PAINTERS.

168
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:30,204
- I THINK I TURNED OUT 
PRETTY DARN WELL, MYSELF.

169
00:05:30,204 --> 00:05:32,206
- OH, YOU JUST TURNED OUT GREAT.

170
00:05:32,206 --> 00:05:34,917
I USED MY CONTACTS TO 
GET YOU A JOB, AND YOU QUIT.

171
00:05:34,917 --> 00:05:36,126
[narrator] 
THE JOB WAS AT

172
00:05:36,126 --> 00:05:38,212
AN IRAQI-OWNED TOY STORE,

173
00:05:38,212 --> 00:05:40,965
THAT WAS HOPING 
TO DETER SHOPLIFTING.

174
00:05:40,965 --> 00:05:45,094
- OKAY, I'LL JUST TAKE OFF 
THIS CHEAP FAKE HAND,

175
00:05:45,094 --> 00:05:47,847
AND WE GONNA PUT ON 
THIS SIGN.

176
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:50,057
BEAUTIFUL. 
YOU LIKE?

177
00:05:50,057 --> 00:05:51,809
- THEY ONLY WANTED ME 
BECAUSE I HAD ONE HAND--

178
00:05:51,809 --> 00:05:53,268
AND I WON'T DO IT!

179
00:05:53,268 --> 00:05:55,104
THAT'S NOT THE WAY MOTHER 
IS RAISING ME.

180
00:05:55,104 --> 00:05:57,356
- LIKE I WON'T COMPETE... 
WITH MY OLDER BROTHER ANYMORE,

181
00:05:57,356 --> 00:05:59,233
DESPITE THE WAY FATHER 
RAISED ME.

182
00:05:59,233 --> 00:06:00,818
WE'LL SHOW YOU.

183
00:06:00,818 --> 00:06:03,571
- JUST LIKE I SHOWED 
MR. AL-JIBAALY MUHAMMED A-ABAT.

184
00:06:03,571 --> 00:06:07,074
I STOLE THIS SIGN.

185
00:06:07,074 --> 00:06:09,368
OF COURSE, I LEFT 
MY HAND THERE ALSO.

186
00:06:09,368 --> 00:06:10,745
[narrator] 
BUT FAO AL-JIBAALY

187
00:06:10,745 --> 00:06:13,539
MUHAMMED A-ABAT...

188
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:17,167
WASN'T THE ONLY ONE 
HAVING TROUBLE SCARING KIDS.

189
00:06:17,167 --> 00:06:19,420
SO WAS HOLLYWOOD'S 
THIRD-YOUNGEST

190
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:21,922
MOVIE STUDIO EXECUTIVE, 
MAEBY FUNKE

191
00:06:21,922 --> 00:06:23,508
[woman on screen] 
THE CREATURE'S IN

192
00:06:23,508 --> 00:06:24,925
YOUR IMAGINATION.

193
00:06:24,925 --> 00:06:27,094
[screams]

194
00:06:27,094 --> 00:06:30,806
[laughter]

195
00:06:30,806 --> 00:06:32,307
- THAT'S THE BLOODSUCKER?

196
00:06:32,307 --> 00:06:34,309
IT LOOKS LIKE ALF. 
YOU GOT A WEEK TO FIX IT.

197
00:06:34,309 --> 00:06:35,936
[man on screen] 
THIS MUST BE THE CREATURE

198
00:06:35,936 --> 00:06:37,104
THAT ATE OUR CAT.

199
00:06:37,104 --> 00:06:38,939
[laughter]

200
00:06:38,939 --> 00:06:40,691
[narrator] 
AND MICHAEL MET UP WITH GOB.

201
00:06:40,691 --> 00:06:41,776
- HEY, GOB.

202
00:06:41,776 --> 00:06:43,152
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME

203
00:06:43,152 --> 00:06:45,029
THAT COLOMBIAN THING 
WAS DAD'S IDEA?

204
00:06:45,029 --> 00:06:47,281
- WELL, DAD SAID NOT TO BECAUSE 
YOU DON'T THINK I'M SMART,

205
00:06:47,281 --> 00:06:48,908
AND THAT I SHOULD 
TAKE CREDIT FOR IT.

206
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:50,868
IT WAS JUST DAD... 
TRYING TO TURN US AGAINST EACH

207
00:06:50,868 --> 00:06:52,787
OTHER AGAIN, AND OF COURSE 
I THINK YOU'RE SMART.

208
00:06:52,787 --> 00:06:54,329
OKAY? HEY, WHAT'S 
GOING ON DOWN THERE?

209
00:06:54,329 --> 00:06:55,873
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

210
00:06:55,873 --> 00:06:57,750
- YOU DON'T WANT A HUNGRY DOVE 
DOWN YOUR PANTS.

211
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,752
THAT'S HOW TONY WONDER 
LOST A NUT.

212
00:06:59,752 --> 00:07:03,380
LOOK, I KNOW THAT I DON'T KNOW 
ABOUT THIS HOUSING STUFF,

213
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:05,841
BUT I'VE GOT THIS 
CHRISTIAN GIRLFRIEND NOW,

214
00:07:05,841 --> 00:07:08,302
AND SHE'S TRYING TO GET ME 
TO BE A BETTER MAN...

215
00:07:08,302 --> 00:07:10,304
AND RECONNECT WITH MY SON,

216
00:07:10,304 --> 00:07:11,514
AND I'M TRYING TO GET HER

217
00:07:11,514 --> 00:07:13,265
TO RENOUNCE GOD 
AND-- [bleep] ME,

218
00:07:13,265 --> 00:07:16,602
AND I JUST WANT TO PROVE TO HER 
THAT I'M WORTH IT.

219
00:07:16,602 --> 00:07:18,729
- AS ALWAYS, GOB, 
A MIXED BAG THERE,

220
00:07:18,729 --> 00:07:21,106
BUT THE MIDDLE PART SOUNDED 
PRETTY ADMIRABLE FOR A SECOND,

221
00:07:21,106 --> 00:07:22,650
SO HERE'S WHAT I WANT TO DO.

222
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:24,610
I WANT TO GET YOU YOUR OWN 
BANANA STAND FRANCHISE,

223
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:26,821
AND YOU CAN HAVE STEVE 
WORK AT IT.

224
00:07:26,821 --> 00:07:28,280
- YOU'D DO THAT FOR ME?

225
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:30,700
- YES. YEAH. YOU CAN 
DESIGN YOUR OWN SHACK.

226
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:32,660
- AND CHOOSE MY OWN LOCATION? 
- WHATEVER YOU WANT.

227
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:34,579
YOU'RE GONNA BE 100% 
IN CHARGE, ALL RIGHT?

228
00:07:34,579 --> 00:07:37,039
BUT THE MOST IMPORTANT THING 
IS THAT WE NEVER LET DAD...

229
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:38,583
TURN US AGAINST 
EACH OTHER AGAIN.

230
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:41,085
- THANKS, MICHAEL.

231
00:07:41,085 --> 00:07:43,713
HMM.

232
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:48,050
IF YOU FEEL SOMETHING 
MOVING DOWN THERE,

233
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:49,301
IT'S JUST THE BIRD.

234
00:07:49,301 --> 00:07:51,261
- I KNOW IT. 
[dove cooing]

235
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:54,849
[narrator] 
AND A FEW DAYS LATER,

236
00:07:54,849 --> 00:07:56,100
[ringing]

237
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:57,685
MICHAEL GOT A CALL 
FROM HIS SON.

238
00:07:57,685 --> 00:07:59,687
- HEY, DAD, DID YOU KNOW 
GOB STARTED A BANANA STAND?

239
00:07:59,687 --> 00:08:01,188
- YEAH, THAT WAS MY IDEA.

240
00:08:01,188 --> 00:08:03,190
I'M TRYING TO GET US 
TO BE LESS COMPETITIVE.

241
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:05,776
- THAT'S GONNA BE DIFFICULT.

242
00:08:05,776 --> 00:08:08,529
PLUS THEY HAVE 
A VERY AGGRESSIVE SLOGAN.

243
00:08:17,622 --> 00:08:19,039
[narrator] 
GOB HAD OPENED A NEW

244
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:20,875
FROZEN BANANA STAND, LIKE,

245
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:22,752
TWENTY FEET FROM THE OLD 
FROZEN BANANA STAND.

246
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:24,461
- WHAT'S GOING ON?

247
00:08:24,461 --> 00:08:26,380
YOU JUST THOUGHT YOU'D 
PUT THE STAND RIGHT HERE?

248
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:28,007
- DID THE RESEARCH.

249
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:29,925
DO YOU KNOW THAT MORE 
FROZEN BANANAS ARE SOLD...

250
00:08:29,925 --> 00:08:32,136
RIGHT HERE ON THIS BOARDWALK 
THAN ANYWHERE IN THE O.C.?

251
00:08:32,136 --> 00:08:33,929
- DON'T CALL IT THAT.

252
00:08:33,929 --> 00:08:36,056
- ALSO GONNA NEED A CHECK, 
'CAUSE I KIND OF WENT...

253
00:08:36,056 --> 00:08:37,558
OUT OF POCKET ON THE NEW SIGN--

254
00:08:37,558 --> 00:08:39,519
AND I NEED SOME BANANAS 
AND SOME CHOCOLATE...

255
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,270
FROM THE OTHER BRANCH.

256
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:43,355
- JUST TAKE THE SIGN DOWN-- 
TAKE THE WHOLE BOOTH DOWN.

257
00:08:43,355 --> 00:08:44,899
YOU'RE CANNIBALIZING 
OUR BUSINESS.

258
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:46,734
- YOU'RE JUST SCARED 
OF A LITTLE "COMPETISH."

259
00:08:46,734 --> 00:08:48,402
- YOU GUYS DON'T EVEN 
HAVE BANANAS, SO I'M

260
00:08:48,402 --> 00:08:50,154
NOT TOO WORRIED.- 
IN FACT, YOU KNOW WHAT?

261
00:08:50,154 --> 00:08:52,239
ME AND MY SON ARE GONNA 
KICK YOUR LITTLE SHACK'S ASS.

262
00:08:52,239 --> 00:08:53,741
- DAD, IT'S OKAY.

263
00:08:53,741 --> 00:08:55,576
WE CAN JUST WORK 
TOGETHER WITH THEM, YOU KNOW?

264
00:08:55,576 --> 00:08:57,119
- THAT MAKES SENSE.

265
00:08:57,119 --> 00:08:58,871
I MEAN, WE DON'T REALLY 
EVEN KNOW THE RECIPE.

266
00:08:58,871 --> 00:09:00,956
- YOU JUST FREEZE THE BANANA, 
AND THEN YOU STICK IT--

267
00:09:00,956 --> 00:09:02,542
- DON'T TELL 'EM. 
- STICK IT IN THE WHAT?

268
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:04,084
- NO, IT'S OKAY. 
WE'LL FIGURE IT OUT.

269
00:09:04,084 --> 00:09:05,795
AND WHEN WE DO, 
WE'LL HAVE THE LAST LAUGH.

270
00:09:05,795 --> 00:09:07,672
WE'LL BE THE LAUGHINGSTOCK 
OF THE BOARDWALK.

271
00:09:07,672 --> 00:09:09,590
[narrator] 
MEANWHILE, LINDSAY WAS PREPARING

272
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:11,133
FOR HER OWN COMPETITION.

273
00:09:11,133 --> 00:09:13,093
- THIS IS TREAT. 
HE'LL BE REPRESENTING YOU.

274
00:09:13,093 --> 00:09:16,096
HE STARTED OFF AS MY PARALEGAL, 
BUT HE'S A LAWYER NOW.

275
00:09:16,096 --> 00:09:18,599
- WELL, AS OF NEXT MONDAY. 
- WELL, WE'LL FUDGE THAT.

276
00:09:18,599 --> 00:09:20,267
LINDSAY, JUST DO ME 
ONE FAVOR.

277
00:09:20,267 --> 00:09:21,936
DON'T MENTION ME BY NAME

278
00:09:21,936 --> 00:09:23,979
WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT 
YOUR FUTURE PLANS FOR DATING.

279
00:09:23,979 --> 00:09:25,815
IT REFLECTS POORLY ON ME.

280
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:28,275
- RIGHT, RIGHT. 
THE CONFLICT OF INTEREST.

281
00:09:28,275 --> 00:09:30,653
- YEAH, THAT TOO.

282
00:09:30,653 --> 00:09:34,073
- HELLO, LINDSAY. 
- TOBIAS. DID YOU GET A LAWYER?

283
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:35,449
ONLY THE BEST-LOOKING

284
00:09:35,449 --> 00:09:37,952
AND BEST-EDUCATED LAWYER 
IN THE WHOLE O.C.

285
00:09:37,952 --> 00:09:39,954
- DON'T CALL IT THAT. 
- OKAY.

286
00:09:39,954 --> 00:09:42,623
- BOB LOBLAW. HOW ARE YOU? 
- BOB'S REPRESENTING YOU?

287
00:09:42,623 --> 00:09:44,041
[narrator] 
HE WAS.

288
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:46,210
ONE DAY EARLIER, 
TOBIAS HAD SPOKEN TO HIM...

289
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:47,837
ON THE PHONE.

290
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:49,922
- WHETHER OR NOT THOSE 
PROMISES WERE MADE EXPLICIT.

291
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:54,301
- YOU... WANT ME 
TO BE EXPLICIT?

292
00:09:54,301 --> 00:09:56,303
ANYWAY, AS IT TURNS OUT,

293
00:09:56,303 --> 00:09:57,597
BOB WAS OFFERING 
TO BE MY LAWYER.

294
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:59,640
[chuckles]

295
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,642
[narrator] 
AND THAT NIGHT,

296
00:10:01,642 --> 00:10:03,268
BUSTER ARRIVED 
WITH A POST-OP LUCILLE.

297
00:10:03,268 --> 00:10:04,979
- THERE SHE IS.

298
00:10:04,979 --> 00:10:06,521
- [muffled]

299
00:10:06,521 --> 00:10:09,191
- SHE WANTS TO KNOW 
WHERE YOU WANT TO PUT HER.

300
00:10:09,191 --> 00:10:11,485
- SHE CAN TAKE MY ROOM. 
- [muffled]

301
00:10:11,485 --> 00:10:13,153
- SHE WANTS TO KNOW 
IF I CAN SLEEP THERE TOO.

302
00:10:13,153 --> 00:10:14,655
- [ frantic mumbling ]

303
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:16,240
- SHE SAID THAT'S VERY 
IMPORTANT TO HER.

304
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,574
ALL RIGHT.

305
00:10:17,574 --> 00:10:19,118
I'LL MEET YOU 
UP THERE, MOTHER.

306
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:21,578
- [muffled]

307
00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:25,625
- YOU BETTER NOT LOCK IT! 
I'LL KICK IT IN!

308
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:27,292
OH, BY THE WAY.

309
00:10:27,292 --> 00:10:29,294
DOCTOR SAID NO KISSING HER 
ON THE FACE FOR ONE WEEK.

310
00:10:29,294 --> 00:10:30,545
I WAS LIKE,

311
00:10:30,545 --> 00:10:32,673
"MAKE IT TWO WEEKS. 
SEE IF I CARE."

312
00:10:32,673 --> 00:10:35,300
[laughs] 
- GOT A NEW HAND?

313
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:37,511
- OH, YEAH. 
I'M TRYING IT OUT.

314
00:10:37,511 --> 00:10:39,179
GUESS WHO I RAN INTO 
AT THE PROSTHETIC SHOP

315
00:10:39,179 --> 00:10:40,389
WHILE I WAS WAITING FOR MOTHER.

316
00:10:40,389 --> 00:10:42,391
[man] 
SORRY, NO REFUNDS--

317
00:10:42,391 --> 00:10:44,727
AND THAT'S WHY YOU DON'T TAKE 
YOUR FOOT OUT OF ITS WRAPPER.

318
00:10:44,727 --> 00:10:47,187
- J. WALTER WEATHERMAN.

319
00:10:47,187 --> 00:10:49,023
YOU'RE THE MAN WHO USED 
TO SCARE US AS CHILDREN,

320
00:10:49,023 --> 00:10:50,065
AND ONE TIME AS AN ADULT.

321
00:10:50,065 --> 00:10:51,608
[narrator] 
GEORGE SR.

322
00:10:51,608 --> 00:10:53,402
HAD ALWAYS USED HIM... 
TO TEACH HIS CHILDREN

323
00:10:53,402 --> 00:10:55,320
LASTING LESSONS.

324
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:57,114
THEY USUALLY INVOLVED 
HIS PROSTHETIC ARM

325
00:10:57,114 --> 00:10:59,366
BEING RIPPED OFF.

326
00:10:59,366 --> 00:11:00,951
[screaming]

327
00:11:00,951 --> 00:11:05,205
- AND THAT'S WHY YOU ALWAYS 
LEAVE A NOTE.

328
00:11:05,205 --> 00:11:07,041
YOU'RE ONE 
OF GEORGE BLUTH'S KIDS.

329
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:08,709
- UH-HUH.

330
00:11:08,709 --> 00:11:10,878
- I GUESS YOU'LL BE 
SCARING CHILDREN YOURSELF NOW.

331
00:11:10,878 --> 00:11:12,379
- AS A MATTER OF FACT, I WON'T.

332
00:11:12,379 --> 00:11:14,840
IF ANYTHING, IT 
STRENGTHENED MY RESOLVE...

333
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:17,301
TO BE MORE THAN JUST 
A ONE-ARMED MAN--

334
00:11:17,301 --> 00:11:21,221
EVEN IF IT MEANS ME NEVER 
TAKING A JOB AGAIN.

335
00:11:21,221 --> 00:11:23,598
[phone rings] 
- ALMOST MAKES IT WORTH IT.

336
00:11:23,598 --> 00:11:24,850
HELLO.

337
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:26,101
- LISTEN. I HEARD...

338
00:11:26,101 --> 00:11:28,395
THAT YOU GAVE GOB 
A BANANA STAND.

339
00:11:28,395 --> 00:11:29,604
THEY DID GREAT.

340
00:11:29,604 --> 00:11:31,273
HE AND STEVE TOOK IN 
OVER $700.

341
00:11:31,273 --> 00:11:33,317
- THEY DID? 
- YEAH.

342
00:11:33,317 --> 00:11:35,820
SO I GUESS THE BLUTH COMPANY'S 
GOT A NEW HEIR.

343
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,654
[narrator] 
THAT'S WHEN MICHAEL REALIZED

344
00:11:37,654 --> 00:11:39,782
IT WAS TIME TO GET SERIOUS.

345
00:11:39,782 --> 00:11:41,158
- GEORGE MICHAEL,

346
00:11:41,158 --> 00:11:42,910
DO YOU KNOW WHERE 
THE BANANA SUIT IS?

347
00:11:45,287 --> 00:11:46,705
[narrator] 
THAT NIGHT, MAEBY,

348
00:11:46,705 --> 00:11:49,291
DISPLACED BY BUSTER, 
HEARD A NOISE.

349
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:51,668
[liquid pouring]

350
00:11:51,668 --> 00:11:55,214
- HELLO? GEORGE MICHAEL? 
- [hissing]

351
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:58,383
I'M THIRSTY. 
- [screaming]

352
00:11:58,383 --> 00:12:00,260
[narrator] 
AND MAEBY KNEW SHE HAD FOUND

353
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:02,137
HER BLOODSUCKING CREATURE.

354
00:12:02,137 --> 00:12:07,184
THE NEXT DAY, MICHAEL TOOK OFF 
WORK TO MAN THE BANANA STAND,

355
00:12:07,184 --> 00:12:08,602
WHILE HIS SON 
MANNED A BANANA.

356
00:12:08,602 --> 00:12:10,520
- HOW YOU DOIN' THERE, CHAMP?

357
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:11,897
- IS MY NAME CHAMP? 
IT'S SO HOT.

358
00:12:11,897 --> 00:12:14,066
- WHY DON'T YOU TAKE FIVE?

359
00:12:14,066 --> 00:12:15,985
- THAT'S NOT INCLUDING 
THE FIVE MINUTES IT TAKES

360
00:12:15,985 --> 00:12:17,277
TO GET OUT OF THIS THING?

361
00:12:17,277 --> 00:12:18,904
- YOU'RE NOT GETTING 
OUT OF IT.

362
00:12:18,904 --> 00:12:21,073
- ATTENTION, EVERYONE. 
WHY GO TO A BANANA STAND

363
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:23,200
WHEN WE CAN MAKE 
YOUR BANANA STAND?

364
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,953
I GIVE YOU BARBARA 
AND DEE.

365
00:12:25,953 --> 00:12:27,704
[smooth jazz]

366
00:12:27,704 --> 00:12:29,498
DON'T WORRY.

367
00:12:29,498 --> 00:12:31,876
THESE YOUNG BEAUTIES HAVE 
BEEN NOWHERE NEAR THE BANANAS.

368
00:12:31,876 --> 00:12:33,627
- DAD, ARE THEY STRIPPERS?

369
00:12:33,627 --> 00:12:35,629
- IF I KNOW YOUR UNCLE, 
THEY'RE AT LEAST STRIPPERS.

370
00:12:35,629 --> 00:12:36,755
I GUESS WE GOTTA UP THE ANTE.

371
00:12:36,755 --> 00:12:38,340
- NO, DAD.

372
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:40,092
THEN THEY'RE 
JUST GONNA UP IT, AND IT'LL

373
00:12:40,092 --> 00:12:42,052
GO BACK AND FORTH ALL DAY.

374
00:12:42,052 --> 00:12:44,179
- IF THAT'S WHAT IT TAKES, 
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO.

375
00:12:44,179 --> 00:12:45,764
[narrator] 
AND THEY DID--

376
00:12:45,764 --> 00:12:47,892
BUT IT WAS LESS ENTERTAINING 
THAN YOU MIGHT IMAGINE--

377
00:12:49,476 --> 00:12:51,812
NO MATTER WHAT MUSIC 
WAS PUT UNDER IT.

378
00:12:51,812 --> 00:12:54,606
[man singing in spanish]

379
00:12:54,606 --> 00:12:57,067
[r&amp;b]

380
00:12:57,067 --> 00:12:59,153
[folk-rock]

381
00:12:59,153 --> 00:13:03,615
[jazz] 
[pop]

382
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:08,120
[r&amp;b]

383
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,413
[narrator] 
IT WAS KIND OF FUNNY

384
00:13:09,413 --> 00:13:10,998
TO "YELLOW SUBMARINE,"

385
00:13:10,998 --> 00:13:13,542
BUT WHO COULD AFFORD IT? 
[camera shutter clicking]

386
00:13:16,211 --> 00:13:18,672
SO HERE'S WHAT HAPPENED 
AT THE END.

387
00:13:18,672 --> 00:13:21,425
- HEY, STOP FIGHTING! 
STOP IT!

388
00:13:21,425 --> 00:13:22,927
- THAT'S IT. 
THEY'RE RIGHT, OKAY?

389
00:13:22,927 --> 00:13:25,137
THIS IS INSANE. 
WE'RE JUST "BOYFIGHTING" AGAIN.

390
00:13:25,137 --> 00:13:27,181
- AND FOR WHAT? 
A HEFTY BAG FULL OF PESOS.

391
00:13:27,181 --> 00:13:30,350
- YOU'VE BEEN TAKING PESOS? 
- DAD SAID I SHOULD.

392
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:33,187
- DAD'S INVOLVED WITH THIS? 
- WELL, HE CHOSE THE LOCATION--

393
00:13:33,187 --> 00:13:35,397
AND THE STRIPPERS AND THE SIGN. 
EVERY PART OF IT, REALLY.

394
00:13:35,397 --> 00:13:36,982
- WAIT A MINUTE.

395
00:13:36,982 --> 00:13:38,608
DON'T YOU SEE 
WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE?

396
00:13:38,608 --> 00:13:40,694
DAD'S CLEARLY GOING AHEAD 
WITH THE COLOMBIAN DEAL,

397
00:13:40,694 --> 00:13:42,737
AND HE'S LAUNDERING IT 
THROUGH YOUR BANANA SHACK.

398
00:13:42,737 --> 00:13:44,031
HE PITTED US AGAINST EACH OTHER

399
00:13:44,031 --> 00:13:45,115
SO I'D BE TOO BUSY TO NOTICE.

400
00:13:45,115 --> 00:13:46,700
WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT?

401
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:48,493
I THINK IT'S TIME FOR US 
TO TEACH DAD A LESSON.

402
00:13:48,493 --> 00:13:50,162
- GET THE PERSON WHO 
TERRORIZED US THE MOST

403
00:13:50,162 --> 00:13:51,997
IN OUR CHILDHOOD.

404
00:13:51,997 --> 00:13:54,833
- SHE'S STILL HEALING. 
LET'S GET J. WALTER WEATHERMAN.

405
00:14:02,424 --> 00:14:04,634
[narrator] 
MICHAEL AND GOB HAD DECIDED...

406
00:14:04,634 --> 00:14:06,678
TO TEACH THEIR FATHER 
A LESSON.

407
00:14:06,678 --> 00:14:08,388
- WE NEED THE NUMBER 
OF THE ONE-ARMED MAN.

408
00:14:08,388 --> 00:14:09,974
- I'M NOT GIVING YOU THAT.

409
00:14:09,974 --> 00:14:12,351
YOU WANT TO USE HIS 
DISABILITY TO SCARE SOMEONE.

410
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:15,562
THAT'S EVERYTHING I'M AGAINST. 
READ THE BUTTON, MISTER!

411
00:14:17,522 --> 00:14:20,484
- "THE ONLY SCARY THING 
ABOUT...

412
00:14:20,484 --> 00:14:22,236
A ONE-ARMED MAN 
TRYING TO SCARE SOMEONE

413
00:14:22,236 --> 00:14:24,029
IS THE FACT THAT"-- 
- THAT HE FEELS THAT HIS

414
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:26,240
ONE ARM IS GOOD FOR NOTHING 
BUT TRYING TO SCARE SOMEBODY.

415
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,782
- IT'S UPSIDE DOWN.

416
00:14:27,782 --> 00:14:29,326
- LET'S SEE YOU TRY 
TO PUT A BUTTON ON...

417
00:14:29,326 --> 00:14:30,619
WITH THIS. 
- [screams]

418
00:14:30,619 --> 00:14:31,996
- STOP SCREAMING. 
IT'S NOT SCARY.

419
00:14:31,996 --> 00:14:33,330
- I'M GONNA 
GET THE NUMBER MYSELF,

420
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:34,957
'CAUSE WE'RE NOT GONNA...

421
00:14:34,957 --> 00:14:36,959
GO THROUGH OUR LIVES 
BEING CONTROLLED BY THIS GUY.

422
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:38,418
WHAT IS MORE PATHETIC

423
00:14:38,418 --> 00:14:40,212
THAN GROWN MEN BEING 
SCARED OF THEIR FATHER?

424
00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:41,338
- I'M THIRSTY.

425
00:14:41,338 --> 00:14:42,756
[screaming] 
- OH, MY GOD!

426
00:14:42,756 --> 00:14:44,758
[narrator] 
THIS CONTINUED FOR A WHILE.

427
00:14:44,758 --> 00:14:46,010
AND LATER, MICHAEL AND GOB

428
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:47,469
WENT TO PUT THEIR PLAN 
IN ACTION.

429
00:14:47,469 --> 00:14:49,096
- I GAVE THE COLOMBIANS 
BACK THEIR MONEY,

430
00:14:49,096 --> 00:14:50,555
AND I TOLD THEM...

431
00:14:50,555 --> 00:14:52,016
THAT YOU HAD NO RIGHT 
TO MAKE THE DEAL.

432
00:14:52,016 --> 00:14:53,267
I HAVE TO WARN YOU, THOUGH,

433
00:14:53,267 --> 00:14:54,935
THEY DIDN'T SOUND 
TOO HAPPY.

434
00:14:54,935 --> 00:14:56,686
- LET'S JUST HOPE THEY 
DON'T TRY TO GET EVEN BY

435
00:14:56,686 --> 00:14:58,522
"CIR-SUM-VENTING" THE LAW.

436
00:14:58,522 --> 00:15:00,941
- WHAT IS THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN? 
- KIDNAP OR-- MICHAEL SAID IT.

437
00:15:00,941 --> 00:15:02,817
- WHAT, ARE YOU KIDDING? 
I HAVE AN ANKLE MONITOR.

438
00:15:02,817 --> 00:15:05,112
I CAN'T EVEN GO INTO THE HALLWAY 
WITHOUT THE COPS COMING UP.

439
00:15:05,112 --> 00:15:06,571
STOP IT!

440
00:15:06,571 --> 00:15:08,032
- CLEARLY YOU KNOW 
WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

441
00:15:08,032 --> 00:15:09,658
THERE'S AN OFF CHANCE

442
00:15:09,658 --> 00:15:11,618
THEY MIGHT JUST WANT TO 
TAKE YOU, LEAVE THE ANKLE.

443
00:15:11,618 --> 00:15:13,037
BUT ANYHOW-- 
STALL HIM.

444
00:15:13,037 --> 00:15:14,663
[narrator] 
AND MICHAEL WENT TO SOLICIT

445
00:15:14,663 --> 00:15:16,415
HELP FOR THE LESSON.

446
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:18,625
- HOW WOULD YOU AND SOME OF 
YOUR FRIENDS LIKE TO HELP US...

447
00:15:18,625 --> 00:15:19,668
TEACH MR. BLUTH A LESSON?

448
00:15:19,668 --> 00:15:21,336
MAYBE POSE AS COLOMBIANS.

449
00:15:21,336 --> 00:15:22,671
- BUT WE ARE GUATEMALAN.

450
00:15:22,671 --> 00:15:24,298
WON'T HE KNOW 
THE DIFFERENCE?

451
00:15:24,298 --> 00:15:26,926
- I THINK ANYTHING SOUTH 
OF SAN DIEGO WILL BE JUST FINE.

452
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:28,343
- ORLANDO WAS 
IN THE GROUNDLINGS.

453
00:15:28,343 --> 00:15:30,304
- JUST CLASSES.

454
00:15:30,304 --> 00:15:32,973
IS IT GOING TO BE UNSCRIPTED, 
LIKE CURB?

455
00:15:32,973 --> 00:15:34,724
[narrator] 
GEORGE SR., MEANWHILE, HAD

456
00:15:34,724 --> 00:15:36,977
GROWN SUSPICIOUS OF HIS SONS.

457
00:15:36,977 --> 00:15:39,313
- WHAT WAS THAT 
WITH MICHAEL JUST NOW?

458
00:15:39,313 --> 00:15:42,316
- HE WANTS TO TEACH YOU 
A LESSON.

459
00:15:42,316 --> 00:15:44,568
- WHAT KIND OF LESSON? 
- J. WALTER WEATHERMAN LESSON.

460
00:15:44,568 --> 00:15:47,237
HE'S GONNA FAKE YOUR KIDNAPPING 
AND HELICOPTER RIDE TO COLOMBIA.

461
00:15:47,237 --> 00:15:50,240
- HE'S GONNA TEACH ME A LESSON 
USING MY OWN SCARE TOY?

462
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,659
- WEATHERMAN WOULDN'T DO IT. 
I THINK BUSTER TURNED HIM.

463
00:15:52,659 --> 00:15:54,619
- YEAH, WELL, 
HE'LL SAY YES FOR ME.

464
00:15:54,619 --> 00:15:56,080
WE'LL GO ALONG WITH HIS LESSON,

465
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,957
BUT WE'RE GONNA TEACH HIM 
ONE OF OUR OWN--

466
00:15:57,957 --> 00:15:59,416
BUT IT'S GOTTA 
BE A SECRET, OKAY?

467
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:01,418
BETWEEN A DAD AND HIS--

468
00:16:01,418 --> 00:16:04,213
HIS FAVORITE SON.

469
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:09,176
- DON'T WORRY, POP. 
GOB BLUTH DOESN'T CAVE.

470
00:16:09,176 --> 00:16:11,761
- YEAH, YOU JUST DID FOR ME.

471
00:16:11,761 --> 00:16:13,222
- WELL, YOU ASKED ME TO 
SO I THOUGHT--

472
00:16:13,222 --> 00:16:14,473
- OKAY, GO, GO, GO. IT'S FINE.

473
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:15,849
[narrator] 
AND LINDSAY AND TOBIAS

474
00:16:15,849 --> 00:16:17,642
WERE BACK WITH THE ARBITRATOR.

475
00:16:17,642 --> 00:16:19,686
- AS YOU KNOW, IT IS VERY 
DIFFICULT...

476
00:16:19,686 --> 00:16:21,146
TO ESTABLISH 
FAULT IN A DIVORCE,

477
00:16:21,146 --> 00:16:22,897
BUT ONE INDICATOR IS FIDELITY.

478
00:16:22,897 --> 00:16:26,651
MY CLIENT HAS NOT PURSUED SEX 
OUTSIDE OF THIS MARRIAGE.

479
00:16:26,651 --> 00:16:28,945
- NOR IN IT. 
- I GOT THIS ONE.

480
00:16:28,945 --> 00:16:30,072
CAN THE SAME 
BE SAID FOR YOU?

481
00:16:30,072 --> 00:16:31,740
- OH, ABSOLUTELY.

482
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:33,700
I'VE DONE EVERYTHING 
TO MAKE THIS MARRIAGE WORK.

483
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:35,410
- THAT'S INTERESTING.

484
00:16:35,410 --> 00:16:37,496
CAN YOU TELL ME WHAT YOUR 
PLANS ARE FOR THIS EVENING?

485
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:39,539
- UH, I HAVE PLANS 
WITH A FRIEND.

486
00:16:39,539 --> 00:16:40,957
- A MAN? 
WHAT'S HIS NAME, PLEASE?

487
00:16:40,957 --> 00:16:42,792
- DON'T ANSWER THAT.

488
00:16:42,792 --> 00:16:45,545
- I WITHDRAW THE QUESTION. 
WHY DON'T WE STOP FOR THE DAY?

489
00:16:45,545 --> 00:16:47,672
SO MRS. FUNKE...

490
00:16:47,672 --> 00:16:49,758
CAN GET TO HER DATE 
WITH HER MYSTERIOUS...

491
00:16:49,758 --> 00:16:52,344
MR. BLAH-BLAH-BLAH.

492
00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:55,430
AT 8:30, UNLESS YOU WANT 
TO SIT AT THE BAR.

493
00:16:55,430 --> 00:16:56,848
[narrator] 
IT WAS THE FIRST TIME

494
00:16:56,848 --> 00:16:57,974
SOMEONE TOOK TOBIAS'S SIDE,

495
00:16:57,974 --> 00:16:59,643
AND HE WANTED TO THANK HIM.

496
00:16:59,643 --> 00:17:01,686
- AS MUCH AS I HATE LOSING 
LINDSAY AND EVERYTHING,

497
00:17:01,686 --> 00:17:03,938
I FEEL LIKE I'M MAKING 
A FRIEND IN YOU,

498
00:17:03,938 --> 00:17:06,566
SO I WAS WONDERING IF MAYBE 
TONIGHT YOU JUST WANT TO...

499
00:17:06,566 --> 00:17:08,568
TAKE IN A MOVIE... 
OR A SCHVITZ...

500
00:17:08,568 --> 00:17:10,195
OR JUST STAY IN AND NEST.

501
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:12,781
- ACTUALLY, I WAS GOING 
TO STAY IN MY OFFICE TONIGHT

502
00:17:12,781 --> 00:17:14,116
AND WORK ON MY LAW BLOG.

503
00:17:14,116 --> 00:17:16,410
- OF COURSE-- 
THE BOB LOBLAW LAW BLOG.

504
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:19,579
[chuckles] 
WOW. YOU, SIR, ARE A MOUTHFUL.

505
00:17:19,579 --> 00:17:21,081
[narrator] 
WHILE TOBIAS

506
00:17:21,081 --> 00:17:22,332
WAS TRYING TO GET HIS MOUTH

507
00:17:22,332 --> 00:17:24,084
AROUND BOB LOBLAW,

508
00:17:24,084 --> 00:17:27,587
MAEBY WAS SHOWING MORT MEYERS 
A MONSTER OF HER OWN.

509
00:17:27,587 --> 00:17:29,173
- [groans] 
OH, THAT'S TERRIFYING.

510
00:17:29,173 --> 00:17:30,340
WHO DID THAT FOR YOU,

511
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:32,301
INDUSTRIAL LIGHT 
&amp; MAGIC?

512
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:34,761
- TOPELSON PLASTIC AND SILICONE. 
- DID HE DO LAND OF THE DEAD?

513
00:17:34,761 --> 00:17:37,431
- YEAH. HE'S BEEN 
IN BEVERLY HILLS FOR YEARS.

514
00:17:37,431 --> 00:17:38,723
- GET OUR MAKEUP PEOPLE ON IT.

515
00:17:38,723 --> 00:17:40,600
[narrator] 
AND GEORGE SR. WAITED...

516
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:43,145
FOR THE FAKE KIDNAPPING HE KNEW 
MICHAEL HAD ORCHESTRATED.

517
00:17:43,145 --> 00:17:45,189
[grunting]

518
00:17:45,189 --> 00:17:48,817
- DON'T MOVE! 
- HEY, WELL, LET'S DO IT.

519
00:17:48,817 --> 00:17:50,777
- GET INTO THE BOX, 
OLD MAN.

520
00:17:50,777 --> 00:17:52,612
- OH, BLANKETS. THAT'S-- 
WHO THOUGHT OF THAT?

521
00:17:52,612 --> 00:17:53,780
THAT IS VERY NICE.

522
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:55,699
- COME ON, 
GET IN THE TRUNK!

523
00:17:55,699 --> 00:17:57,617
- WHAT ABOUT-- 
WHAT ABOUT MY ANKLE MONITOR?

524
00:17:57,617 --> 00:17:59,286
- WE HAVE AN ANKLE MONITOR 
DEACTIVATOR.

525
00:17:59,286 --> 00:18:01,037
[beeping]

526
00:18:01,037 --> 00:18:03,082
OH, GOOD. SEE, I'VE BEEN 
MEANING TO GET ONE OF THOSE.

527
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:04,999
I'M NOT GONNA RESIST YOU GUYS 
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW,

528
00:18:04,999 --> 00:18:06,418
I DON'T WANT YOU TO BEAT ME.

529
00:18:06,418 --> 00:18:08,170
[narrator] 
BUT THE MISTREATED PAINTERS...

530
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:10,380
WERE ACTUALLY LOOKING FORWARD 
TO THAT PART.

531
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:13,175
- OH! FORGOT MY iPOD. 
[groans]

532
00:18:15,385 --> 00:18:19,431
[cheering]

533
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:20,599
- START THE HELICOPTER!

534
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:21,891
[narrator] 
AND SO MICHAEL,

535
00:18:21,891 --> 00:18:23,643
BELIEVING HIMSELF...

536
00:18:23,643 --> 00:18:27,856
TO BE AIDED BY GOB, 
SET TO WORK.

537
00:18:27,856 --> 00:18:31,235
BUT THIS TOO PRODUCED 
LESS-THAN-COMPELLING FOOTAGE.

538
00:18:31,235 --> 00:18:33,653
[man singing] 
IN A YELLOW BOAT

539
00:18:33,653 --> 00:18:37,407
A YELLOW BOAT 
A YELLOW BOAT

540
00:18:37,407 --> 00:18:39,201
WE'RE MAKIN' A STAND

541
00:18:39,201 --> 00:18:40,619
IN A YELLOW BOAT

542
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:42,329
[narrator] 
AND THIS IS HOW THAT ENDED.

543
00:18:42,329 --> 00:18:44,414
- PUT ON THE SOUND EFFECTS. 
PUT ON THE SOUND EFFECTS.

544
00:18:44,414 --> 00:18:46,166
[Franklin singing] 
- CD-- CD ONE. CD ONE.

545
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:49,002
[train whistle blowing] 
- TRACK TWO. TRACK TWO.

546
00:18:49,002 --> 00:18:50,295
[jungle sound effects]

547
00:18:50,295 --> 00:18:51,880
- PUT THE HOSTAGE HERE 
BY THE OTTOMAN.

548
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,632
- GET IT OUT OF HERE. 
WHAT'S IT DOING IN HERE?

549
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:55,091
OTTOMAN OUT.

550
00:18:55,091 --> 00:18:56,801
[narrator] 
AND GEORGE SR. WAS RELEASED...

551
00:18:56,801 --> 00:18:58,512
FROM HIS LONG JOURNEY 
INTO THE LIVING ROOM.

552
00:18:58,512 --> 00:18:59,763
- WHERE AM I?

553
00:18:59,763 --> 00:19:01,181
- COLOMBIA. 
WHERE DO YOU THINK?

554
00:19:01,181 --> 00:19:02,891
- AND YOU JUST MISSED 
THE LAST TRAIN...

555
00:19:02,891 --> 00:19:05,519
THAT WILL COME THROUGH 
THE JUNGLE FOR THREE DAYS.

556
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:07,562
- HE'S GOOD. 
- HE'S A GROUNDLING.

557
00:19:07,562 --> 00:19:09,398
- YOU HAVE BETRAYED US, 
AND WE WILL MAKE YOU PAY,

558
00:19:09,398 --> 00:19:10,940
AND THEN WE WILL GO BACK 
FOR YOUR SONS.

559
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:12,692
- MY SONS? 
NO.

560
00:19:12,692 --> 00:19:15,862
- THEY TOO WILL SUFFER 
FOR YOUR TERRIBLE DECISIONS.

561
00:19:15,862 --> 00:19:18,198
- AND YOU SHOULD REALLY PAY YOUR 
WORKERS WHAT THEY DESERVE--

562
00:19:18,198 --> 00:19:20,200
NOT MAKE THEM HAVE TO BUY 
THEIR OWN SUPPLIES.

563
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,118
- NOT JUST THE PAINTING. 
THE SANDING TOO.

564
00:19:22,118 --> 00:19:24,871
- YEAH, AND THE TAPING 
IS VERY TIME-CONSUMING.

565
00:19:24,871 --> 00:19:26,581
[narrator] 
MICHAEL DECIDED HIS FATHER

566
00:19:26,581 --> 00:19:28,417
WAS READY TO LEARN HIS LESSON.

567
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:29,501
- AND THAT IS WHY--

568
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:30,835
- HE'S GOT A GUN!

569
00:19:30,835 --> 00:19:32,086
- I CAN'T LET YOU DO IT! 
GET AWAY!

570
00:19:32,086 --> 00:19:33,297
[gunshot]

571
00:19:33,297 --> 00:19:34,756
GET AWAY. I'LL SHOOT.

572
00:19:34,756 --> 00:19:36,800
I WILL, I WILL. 
I'LL TAKE YOU ALL OUT.

573
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,552
- THIS IS ALL FAKE. 
THESE GUYS ARE PAINTERS.

574
00:19:38,552 --> 00:19:39,719
- I WILL, I WILL!

575
00:19:39,719 --> 00:19:41,012
- OH, GOD! MY ARM.

576
00:19:41,012 --> 00:19:44,391
- DAD, YOU JUST SHOT OFF 
THIS GUY--

577
00:19:44,391 --> 00:19:46,393
THIS GUY'S ARM.

578
00:19:46,393 --> 00:19:50,480
- AND THAT'S WHY YOU DON'T 
TEACH YOUR FATHER A LESSON.

579
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:53,858
- WHO'S THE STUPID ONE NOW? 
THANK YOU, GOB.

580
00:19:53,858 --> 00:19:55,068
- GOB? YOU TOLD HIM?

581
00:19:55,068 --> 00:19:57,571
I THOUGHT WE 
WERE A TEAM.

582
00:19:57,571 --> 00:19:59,072
- IT'S NOT FUN 
FEELING STUPID, IS IT?

583
00:19:59,072 --> 00:20:01,157
- YOU SON OF A--

584
00:20:01,157 --> 00:20:03,243
[both shouting, grunting]

585
00:20:03,243 --> 00:20:04,744
- WAIT A MINUTE. 
I GOTTA GET MY CAMERA.

586
00:20:04,744 --> 00:20:06,120
- GET OFF OF ME!

587
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:08,290
- WHAT IS ALL THIS? 
WHAT'S GOING ON?

588
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:10,459
- KEEP IT IN FRAME. 
YOU WANNA-- CHIN OUT.

589
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:12,586
- I WILL KILL YOU! 
- I'M GONNA KILL YOU.

590
00:20:12,586 --> 00:20:14,629
- YOU'RE GOING OUT OF FRAME. 
- I'LL KILL YOU.

591
00:20:14,629 --> 00:20:16,840
- [screams] 
- NO!

592
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:18,717
- OH, MY GOD! MICHAEL!

593
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:20,134
[panting]

594
00:20:20,134 --> 00:20:23,972
DAD-- IT WAS AN ACCIDENT. 
I'M SORRY.

595
00:20:23,972 --> 00:20:25,849
- AND THAT'S WHY YOU DON'T 
PIT GOB AND ME AGAINST

596
00:20:25,849 --> 00:20:27,809
EACH OTHER.

597
00:20:27,809 --> 00:20:30,687
- YES! YEAH! 
- GOB.

598
00:20:30,687 --> 00:20:32,439
- YOU SET ME UP. 
- THAT'S RIGHT.

599
00:20:32,439 --> 00:20:33,857
- NO MORE "BOYFIGHTS."

600
00:20:33,857 --> 00:20:36,526
- J. WALTER WEATHERMAN 
WAS IN ON IT TOO?

601
00:20:36,526 --> 00:20:38,903
- RIGHT FROM THE VERY START. 
- SO YOU DID USE HIM.

602
00:20:38,903 --> 00:20:41,490
LOOK AT THIS PLACE. 
LOOK AT MY HOME.

603
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:43,575
- FREEZE! DROP THE GUN.

604
00:20:43,575 --> 00:20:45,952
- IT'S OKAY. WE'RE JUST TRYING 
TO TEACH THIS GUY A LESSON.

605
00:20:45,952 --> 00:20:47,287
- DROP THE GUN!

606
00:20:47,287 --> 00:20:50,206
- [screaming] 
OH, MY GOOD HAND!

607
00:20:50,206 --> 00:20:52,376
BUSTER'S GOOD HAND 
JUST CAME...

608
00:20:52,376 --> 00:20:54,836
FLYING OFF.

609
00:20:54,836 --> 00:20:56,963
- AND THAT'S WHY YOU DON'T

610
00:20:56,963 --> 00:20:59,966
USE A ONE-ARMED PERSON 
TO SCARE SOMEONE.

611
00:21:02,093 --> 00:21:03,219
[narrator] 
ON THE NEXT

612
00:21:03,219 --> 00:21:04,804
ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT.

613
00:21:04,804 --> 00:21:07,391
MAEBY FINDS A WAY 
TO SCARE AN ENTIRE GENERATION.

614
00:21:07,391 --> 00:21:08,767
[announcer] 
THIS CHRISTMAS,

615
00:21:08,767 --> 00:21:11,144
TERROR HAS A NEW FACE.

616
00:21:11,144 --> 00:21:13,855
- [guttural voice] 
I'M THIRSTY.

617
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:15,231
[screaming]

618
00:21:15,231 --> 00:21:17,651
[announcer] 
GANGY.

619
00:21:17,651 --> 00:21:19,861
- WE SHOULD START PRODUCTION 
ON GANGY TWO.

620
00:21:19,861 --> 00:21:21,780
- WELL, I KNOW SHE 
WANTED A SKIN PEEL.

621
00:21:27,411 --> 00:21:28,578
[man singing] 
I THINK BACK

622
00:21:28,578 --> 00:21:31,415
TO MY DAYS IN SCHOOL

623
00:21:31,415 --> 00:21:35,126
NOW I SEE I WAS SUCH A FOOL

624
00:21:35,126 --> 00:21:40,590
YELLOW IS JUST 
ANOTHER SHADE OF BLUE

625
00:21:42,175 --> 00:21:43,217
WE'RE FLOATING ALONG

626
00:21:43,217 --> 00:21:45,345
WE'RE FLOATING ALONG..

627
00:21:45,345 --> 00:21:46,638
IN A YELLOW BOAT 
A YELLOW BOAT

628
00:21:46,638 --> 00:21:49,057
IN A YELLOW BOAT.

629
00:21:49,057 --> 00:21:51,518
WE'RE MAKING A STAND 
WE'RE TAKING A STAND--

630
00:21:51,518 --> 00:21:52,769
IN A YELLOW BOAT 
A YELLOW BOAT

631
00:21:52,769 --> 00:21:55,439
A YELLOW BOAT.

632
00:21:55,439 --> 00:21:57,065
A YELLOW BOAT
