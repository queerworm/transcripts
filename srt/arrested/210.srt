00:00:01,042 --> 00:00:02,877
male narrator: NOW THE STORY 
OF A WEALTHY FAMILY

2
00:00:02,877 --> 00:00:04,045
WHO LOST EVERYTHING,

3
00:00:04,045 --> 00:00:06,214
AND THE ONE SON 
WHO HAD NO CHOICE

4
00:00:06,214 --> 00:00:08,883
BUT TO KEEP THEM ALL TOGETHER.

5
00:00:13,763 --> 00:00:16,766
IT'S "ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT."

6
00:00:18,059 --> 00:00:19,519
MICHAEL BLUTH ARRIVED HOME

7
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:22,772
TO FIND HIS MOTHER, LUCILLE, 
IN A STATE OF AGITATION.

8
00:00:22,772 --> 00:00:25,024
- I THINK THE COMPANY'S 
IN TROUBLE.

9
00:00:25,024 --> 00:00:26,276
- WHAT TIPPED YOU?

10
00:00:26,276 --> 00:00:28,861
THE FALLING PROFITS, 
OR THAT WE'RE A REGULAR FEATURE

11
00:00:28,861 --> 00:00:30,821
ON BILL O'REILLY'S "MOST 
RIDICULOUS ITEM OF THE DAY"?

12
00:00:30,821 --> 00:00:33,158
- I'M TALKING ABOUT THE FACT 
THAT MY "FRIEND" LUCILLE AUSTERO

13
00:00:33,158 --> 00:00:37,287
BOUGHT OUR COMPANY, AND I THINK 
SHE'S GOING FOR A POWER GRAB,

14
00:00:37,287 --> 00:00:38,746
THAT BITCH!

15
00:00:38,746 --> 00:00:39,997
- YOU'RE NOT AT HOME, MOM.

16
00:00:39,997 --> 00:00:41,291
SHE DOESN'T LIVE NEXT DOOR 
WHEN YOU'RE HERE.

17
00:00:41,291 --> 00:00:42,917
SECONDLY, 
SHE'S ALREADY GRABBED POWER.

18
00:00:42,917 --> 00:00:44,752
SHE'S THE MAJORITY 
SHAREHOLDER OF THE COMPANY.

19
00:00:44,752 --> 00:00:48,214
- I'LL TELL YOU WHAT SHE WANTS 
TO GRAB: YOUR BROTHER GOB.

20
00:00:48,214 --> 00:00:50,258
narrator: IN FACT, LUCILLE 2 
WAS ALREADY WITH GOB--

21
00:00:50,258 --> 00:00:51,717
- YOU LOOK REALLY NICE.

22
00:00:51,717 --> 00:00:53,428
narrator: BUT SHE WAS GROWING 
TIRED OF HIS NEEDINESS.

23
00:00:53,428 --> 00:00:56,722
- WHERE ARE YOU GOING? 
- I'M GOING TO MY SPIN CLASS.

24
00:00:56,722 --> 00:00:58,724
[door closes] 
- I THOUGHT YOU HAD VERTIGO.

25
00:00:58,724 --> 00:00:59,975
- SHE'LL SELL THE COMPANY

26
00:00:59,975 --> 00:01:01,769
OR BREAK IT UP INTO 
LITTLE PARTS OR SOMETHING,

27
00:01:01,769 --> 00:01:05,190
ALL UNDER THE GUISE OF 
"CARING" ABOUT OUR FAMILY.

28
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:06,566
- GOTTA STOP QUOTING 
WHEN YOU DRINK.

29
00:01:06,566 --> 00:01:09,360
I CERTAINLY HOPE 
SHE'S NOT PLANNING A MOVE.

30
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,611
- I WOULDN'T PUT IT PAST HER.

31
00:01:10,611 --> 00:01:13,781
SHE'D LOVE TO GET AT ME 
ANY WAY SHE COULD.

32
00:01:13,781 --> 00:01:15,533
THAT'S WHY SHE'S BEEN 
FLIRTING WITH GOB.

33
00:01:15,533 --> 00:01:19,204
SHE'S TRYING TO PROVE THAT SHE'S 
CLOSER TO MY CHILDREN THAN I AM,

34
00:01:19,204 --> 00:01:20,455
BUT THE JOKE'S ON HER,

35
00:01:20,455 --> 00:01:22,665
BECAUSE SHE DOESN'T KNOW 
HOW LITTLE I CARE FOR GOB.

36
00:01:22,665 --> 00:01:26,085
- THINK THAT MAKES 
THE JOKE ON GOB.

37
00:01:26,085 --> 00:01:28,129
- HEY, DAD. 
- HEY, BUDDY.

38
00:01:28,129 --> 00:01:30,173
- WAS THAT GANGY WHO WAS JUST--

39
00:01:30,173 --> 00:01:31,424
- YOU ALL RIGHT? SORRY.

40
00:01:31,424 --> 00:01:34,051
YOUR GRANDMOTHER HAD 
A LITTLE ACCIDENT HERE.

41
00:01:34,051 --> 00:01:36,887
- OH, DOES THAT MEAN SHE'S GONNA 
HAVE TO COME LIVE WITH US?

42
00:01:36,887 --> 00:01:38,306
- NO, NO. NO. IT WAS-- 
IT WAS HER DRINK,

43
00:01:38,306 --> 00:01:40,850
AND EVEN IF IT WASN'T, JUST--

44
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:42,518
DO YOU REMEMBER WHEN I BID 
ON SALLY SITWELL

45
00:01:42,518 --> 00:01:43,853
AT THE BACHELORETTE AUCTION?

46
00:01:43,853 --> 00:01:45,104
WELL, THEY SENT ME THIS BASKET

47
00:01:45,104 --> 00:01:46,481
WITH ALL THIS STUFF 
FOR OUR DATE, YOU KNOW.

48
00:01:46,481 --> 00:01:47,607
IT'S A WHOLE PACKAGE.

49
00:01:47,607 --> 00:01:49,359
ANYWAY, I THOUGHT THAT MAYBE 
WE COULD DO IT TOGETHER,

50
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:50,693
YOU KNOW, SORT OF LIKE 
A VALENTINE'S PRESENT.

51
00:01:50,693 --> 00:01:53,113
- YOU'RE NOT GONNA TAKE SALLY? 
- SALLY, NO. NO.

52
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:55,615
I-I WANTED IT FOR US. 
I NEVER WANTED TO BE WITH SALLY.

53
00:01:55,615 --> 00:01:57,283
narrator: ACTUALLY, 
MICHAEL HAD GONE OVER

54
00:01:57,283 --> 00:01:58,618
TO SITWELL ENTERPRISES.

55
00:01:58,618 --> 00:01:59,869
- MICHAEL BLUTH TO SEE SALLY.

56
00:01:59,869 --> 00:02:02,997
narrator: ONE DAY EARLIER 
TO SET UP A DATE WITH SALLY.

57
00:02:02,997 --> 00:02:04,249
- I'M AFRAID SHE'S NOT HERE, 
MICHAEL.

58
00:02:04,249 --> 00:02:09,170
IF YOU'D LIKE ME TO TAKE THE 
PACKAGE, I CAN GIVE IT TO HER.

59
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:10,755
- NO, NO. THIS IS, UH-- 
THIS IS NOT FOR HER.

60
00:02:10,755 --> 00:02:15,301
IT'S FOR MY SON. 
JUST DON'T TELL HER I CAME BY.

61
00:02:15,301 --> 00:02:17,595
narrator: 
IN FACT, SALLY WASN'T THERE,

62
00:02:17,595 --> 00:02:20,055
AND THE PERSON MICHAEL SAW 
WAS HER FATHER.

63
00:02:20,055 --> 00:02:22,057
- YOU KIDDING? THIS MAKES ME 
LOOK LIKE MY DAUGHTER.

64
00:02:22,057 --> 00:02:23,643
- NO ONE'S GOING TO THINK THAT.

65
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:25,060
- I LOOK LIKE EDGAR WINTER HERE. 
FORGET IT.

66
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:26,687
I GOTTA GET TO SPIN CLASS.

67
00:02:26,687 --> 00:02:27,938
- SO WHAT DO YOU SAY?

68
00:02:27,938 --> 00:02:30,275
WE GOT A BASKETFUL 
OF FATHER-SON FUN HERE.

69
00:02:30,275 --> 00:02:31,526
- WHAT'S KAMA SUTRA OIL?

70
00:02:31,526 --> 00:02:33,986
- [clicks tongue] 
MAYBE IT'S NOT FOR US.

71
00:02:33,986 --> 00:02:37,365
- AH, VALENTINE'S DAY, WHICH--

72
00:02:37,365 --> 00:02:39,492
OH! WAS YOUR MOTHER HERE?

73
00:02:39,492 --> 00:02:42,245
- HERE. YOU ALL RIGHT? 
I'LL HELP YOU UP.

74
00:02:42,245 --> 00:02:45,498
- OH, THAT IS QUITE A BASKET 
YOU'VE GOT THERE, MICHAEL.

75
00:02:45,498 --> 00:02:47,625
THAT SALLY SITWELL 
IS ONE LUCKY LADY.

76
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:49,627
- WELL, I'M--I'M NOT SO SURE 
THAT SHE'S ACTUALLY...

77
00:02:49,627 --> 00:02:51,546
RIGHT FOR ME, ANYWAY.

78
00:02:51,546 --> 00:02:53,130
BUT YOU GOT ONE OF THESE TOO, 
DIDN'T YOU?

79
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:55,508
YOU BOUGHT LINDSAY 
AT THE SAME AUCTION.

80
00:02:55,508 --> 00:02:59,053
- WELL, YES, BUT I'M AFRAID 
I PREMATURELY SHOT MY WAD

81
00:02:59,053 --> 00:03:01,306
ON WHAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE 
A DRY RUN, IF YOU WILL.

82
00:03:01,306 --> 00:03:04,517
SO NOW I'M AFRAID I HAVE 
SOMETHING OF A MESS ON MY HANDS.

83
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:06,394
- IT'S JUST--THERE'S SO MANY 
POORLY CHOSEN WORDS

84
00:03:06,394 --> 00:03:07,562
IN THAT SENTENCE.

85
00:03:07,562 --> 00:03:09,021
narrator: 
TOBIAS WANTED TO MAKE SURE

86
00:03:09,021 --> 00:03:11,232
THAT EVERYTHING 
WAS PERFECT FOR LINDSAY,

87
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:14,610
SO HE WENT 
TO CHECK IT OUT FIRST.

88
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:16,946
- OH. BODY CHOCOLATE.

89
00:03:16,946 --> 00:03:19,657
[moans]

90
00:03:19,657 --> 00:03:21,200
IT'S A WONDERFUL PACKAGE. 
I'LL TAKE IT.

91
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,244
- YOU JUST DID.

92
00:03:23,244 --> 00:03:24,370
- WHY DON'T YOU TAKE THIS?

93
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:25,955
I DON'T HAVE ANYONE 
TO GO WITH ANYWAY.

94
00:03:25,955 --> 00:03:27,206
- [chuckles]

95
00:03:27,206 --> 00:03:28,458
CAN YOU IMAGINE HOW JEALOUS 
THAT WOULD MAKE HER?

96
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:30,418
[screeching] 
"WHERE'S TOBIAS?"

97
00:03:30,418 --> 00:03:32,378
"OH, HE'S JUST SHARING 
A ROMANTIC HORSEBACK RIDE

98
00:03:32,378 --> 00:03:33,629
"WITH MICHAEL BLUTH,

99
00:03:33,629 --> 00:03:36,424
AND THEY'RE DIPPING 
EACH OTHER IN--"

100
00:03:36,424 --> 00:03:37,967
OH, YOU DIDN'T GET 
ANY BODY CHOCOLATE.

101
00:03:37,967 --> 00:03:40,428
- I DIDN'T MEAN WITH ME.

102
00:03:40,428 --> 00:03:41,971
I HATE TO SEE YOU STRUGGLE 
LIKE THIS.

103
00:03:41,971 --> 00:03:44,390
IN FACT, WHY DON'T 
YOU LET ME ASK HER FOR YOU?

104
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:48,143
- WELL, MICHAEL, YOU REALLY ARE 
QUITE THE CUPID, AREN'T YOU?

105
00:03:48,143 --> 00:03:52,232
I TELL YOU, YOU CAN ZING YOUR 
ARROW INTO MY BUTTOCKS ANYTIME.

106
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:54,442
- OKAY. YOU KNOW WHAT YOU DO? 
BUY YOURSELF A TAPE RECORDER.

107
00:03:54,442 --> 00:03:56,193
YOU JUST RECORD YOURSELF 
FOR A WHOLE DAY.

108
00:03:56,193 --> 00:03:57,487
I THINK YOU'RE GONNA 
BE SURPRISED

109
00:03:57,487 --> 00:03:59,029
AT SOME OF YOUR PHRASING.

110
00:03:59,029 --> 00:04:01,991
- [gasps] 
BUTTERSCOTCH! WANT A LICK?

111
00:04:01,991 --> 00:04:04,034
narrator: AND LATER, 
LINDSAY STOPPED BY THE OFFICE

112
00:04:04,034 --> 00:04:05,453
AT MICHAEL'S REQUEST.

113
00:04:05,453 --> 00:04:06,704
- GREAT. THANK YOU. 
LISTEN.

114
00:04:06,704 --> 00:04:10,250
I WANT YOU TO TAKE MY ROMANCE 
PACKAGE AT THE FOUR SEAS HOTEL.

115
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,501
- OH, YAY!

116
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:12,793
- THAT'S GREAT. 
TOBIAS IS GONNA BE THRILLED.

117
00:04:12,793 --> 00:04:14,044
- OH. I HAVE TO GO WITH TOBIAS?

118
00:04:14,044 --> 00:04:16,547
- LINDSAY, YOUR HUSBAND 
REALLY WANTS THIS TO WORK.

119
00:04:16,547 --> 00:04:18,007
- COME ON. 
LET ME PLAY CUPID THIS YEAR.

120
00:04:18,007 --> 00:04:21,135
- I THOUGHT HE WENT ALREADY. 
- I'M GIVING YOU MINE.

121
00:04:21,135 --> 00:04:24,639
- BECAUSE YOU'RE AFRAID TO ASK 
SALLY SITWELL TO GO WITH YOU.

122
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:25,890
- THAT'S NOT TRUE AT ALL.

123
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:28,351
- MMM? [imitates chicken] 
CHAW-CHEE-CHAW, CHEE-CHAW.

124
00:04:28,351 --> 00:04:29,644
- WHAT IS THAT? 
IS THAT A CHICKEN?

125
00:04:29,644 --> 00:04:30,645
- WHAT'S THIS?

126
00:04:30,645 --> 00:04:32,229
- OH. MICHAEL'S SCARED 
TO ASK OUT SALLY.

127
00:04:32,229 --> 00:04:34,023
- NO, I'M NOT. 
- CHAW-CHEE-CHAW!

128
00:04:34,023 --> 00:04:37,109
- THIS IS PRICELESS. 
CAW-CA-CAW! CAW-CA-CAW!

129
00:04:37,109 --> 00:04:38,361
- YOU TOO. THIS IS GREAT.

130
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:40,571
COME ON. 
THESE AREN'T EVEN BIRDS.

131
00:04:40,571 --> 00:04:43,449
I AM NOT--THAT'S ENOUGH. 
THERE ARE PEOPLE WORKING.

132
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:46,118
- LISTEN, I THINK THAT LUCILLE 2 
IS UP TO SOMETHING.

133
00:04:46,118 --> 00:04:47,370
- MOM SAID THE SAME THING 
WHEN SHE CAME OVER.

134
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:49,914
I THOUGHT SHE WAS TICKED OFF 
'CAUSE YOU'RE SEEING HER.

135
00:04:49,914 --> 00:04:52,500
- WHAT? YOU'RE SEEING LUCILLE 2? 
DOES BUSTER KNOW?

136
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:56,462
- NO. AND I'M NOT. 
JUST DON'T TELL PEOPLE.

137
00:04:56,462 --> 00:04:57,797
I'M PLAYING THE PART 
OF THE GIGOLO

138
00:04:57,797 --> 00:05:00,425
SO THAT SHE'LL KEEP 
THE COMPANY AFLOAT.

139
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:02,051
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT, SOMETHING 
WEIRD HAPPENED YESTERDAY

140
00:05:02,051 --> 00:05:05,388
WHEN I WAS TRYING 
TO FIND A WAY OUT OF THERE.

141
00:05:05,388 --> 00:05:08,182
[phone ringing]

142
00:05:08,182 --> 00:05:10,184
HELLO?

143
00:05:10,184 --> 00:05:11,436
[dial tone]

144
00:05:11,436 --> 00:05:14,188
narrator: IN FACT, IT WAS 
STAN SITWELL CALLING HER,

145
00:05:14,188 --> 00:05:17,149
AS HE'D BECOME QUITE TAKEN 
WITH LUCILLE 2 HIMSELF.

146
00:05:17,149 --> 00:05:18,401
- YOU KNOW, 
IT ALL MAKES SENSE.

147
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:19,985
WHY ELSE WOULD SALLY SITWELL 
BE AVOIDING ME?

148
00:05:19,985 --> 00:05:21,236
- BECAUSE SHE THINKS 
YOU'RE A LOSER.

149
00:05:21,236 --> 00:05:23,948
- AND WHY WOULD LUCILLE 2 
BE SO DISTANT TOWARD ME?

150
00:05:23,948 --> 00:05:25,282
- 'CAUSE SHE KNOWS 
YOU'RE A LOSER.

151
00:05:25,282 --> 00:05:26,701
- I THINK IT'S PRETTY CLEAR.

152
00:05:26,701 --> 00:05:29,329
LUCILLE 2 AND SITWELL 
ARE WORKING ON A BUSINESS DEAL.

153
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:31,121
LINDSAY, I'D LIKE FOR YOU 
TO GO OVER TO SITWELL

154
00:05:31,121 --> 00:05:32,373
AND SEE WHAT YOU CAN FIND OUT.

155
00:05:32,373 --> 00:05:34,500
I CAN'T GO THERE AGAIN. 
- WHY DO I HAVE TO DO THAT?

156
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,043
- BECAUSE YOU'VE BEEN 
HELPING YOURSELF

157
00:05:36,043 --> 00:05:37,294
TO THE COMPANY MONEY 
FOR QUITE SOME TIME.

158
00:05:37,294 --> 00:05:39,797
IT'S NOT LIKE YOU DO ANYTHING 
FOR THE FAMILY ANYWAY.

159
00:05:39,797 --> 00:05:41,841
- WELL, GOB DOESN'T DO ANYTHING 
FOR THE FAMILY.

160
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:44,510
- HEY, I'M [bleep] LUCILLE 2.

161
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:46,554
- OH. I COULD DO 
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

162
00:05:46,554 --> 00:05:47,972
- THIS IS WHAT DAD 
WAS REALLY GOOD AT--

163
00:05:47,972 --> 00:05:50,140
GETTING US OUT OF TIGHT SPOTS.

164
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:51,684
narrator: IN FACT, 
AT THAT VERY MOMENT,

165
00:05:51,684 --> 00:05:54,562
GEORGE SR. WAS IN A TIGHT SPOT,

166
00:05:54,562 --> 00:05:57,482
AS HE'D GOTTEN HIMSELF 
WEDGED UNDER THE FURNACE

167
00:05:57,482 --> 00:05:58,733
WHILE CHASING AFTER 
A SOUR BALL

168
00:05:58,733 --> 00:06:01,151
THAT HAD ROLLED OUT 
OF HIS POCKET.

169
00:06:01,151 --> 00:06:05,030
- [sighs] 
[howls]

170
00:06:05,030 --> 00:06:07,074
narrator: 
EVENTUALLY, MICHAEL RESCUED HIM.

171
00:06:07,074 --> 00:06:09,410
- I'M JUST STARTING TO WORRY 
SHE'S GONNA SELL US OUT.

172
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:12,663
- I THINK THE ANSWER 
TO THIS PROBLEM IS MONEY.

173
00:06:12,663 --> 00:06:14,081
NOW, THIS MAY JUST BE ME 
HAVING MY HEAD

174
00:06:14,081 --> 00:06:17,167
AGAINST A 100-DEGREE 
FURNACE FOR AN HOUR,

175
00:06:17,167 --> 00:06:19,712
BUT MAYBE WE SHOULD 
BRING IN JACK DORSO.

176
00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:20,963
- UNCLE JACK?

177
00:06:20,963 --> 00:06:24,550
- WELL, NO. HE'S NOT MY UNCLE. 
HE'S MY DAD'S FRIEND.

178
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:26,385
BUT THIS GUY 
HAS GOT A FORTUNE.

179
00:06:26,385 --> 00:06:29,388
narrator: JACK DORSO FIRST 
ACHIEVED SUCCESS IN THE '40s

180
00:06:29,388 --> 00:06:31,140
AS A COSTAR OF THE RADIO AND 
THEN FILM SERIAL,

181
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:34,393
"RED McGIBBON 
AND BULLET: NAZI HUNTERS."

182
00:06:34,393 --> 00:06:36,270
- THERE ARE TWO NAZIS 
UP THERE IN THAT DANCE HALL.

183
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:37,354
- SHOOT ME.

184
00:06:37,354 --> 00:06:38,481
[gunfire] 
[glass shatters]

185
00:06:38,481 --> 00:06:41,108
HAPPY VALENTINE'S DAY, NAZIS.

186
00:06:41,108 --> 00:06:43,903
narrator: WHEN THE ACTOR 
WHO PLAYED RED McGIBBON

187
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:46,781
WAS JAILED FOR 
HIS COMMUNIST SYMPATHIES,

188
00:06:46,781 --> 00:06:50,660
JACK DORSO MADE ONE ATTEMPT 
AT A SOLO BULLET FEATURE.

189
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:52,453
BUT THE AUDIENCE WAS NOT READY 
TO ACCEPT BULLET

190
00:06:52,453 --> 00:06:55,122
AS A ROMANTIC LEAD,

191
00:06:55,122 --> 00:06:58,125
DESPITE HIS POWERFUL UPPER BODY.

192
00:06:58,125 --> 00:07:00,127
SO HE STARTED 
A CHAIN OF GYMNASIUMS,

193
00:07:00,127 --> 00:07:03,923
HAVING STOLEN THE IDEA 
FROM RED DURING A PRISON VISIT.

194
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:06,509
AND AS THE YEARS PASSED-- 
- HEY, JACK!

195
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:07,760
narrator: 
HE BECAME WELL-KNOWN

196
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:11,138
FOR HIS ANNUAL BIRTHDAY FEATS 
OF STRENGTH.

197
00:07:11,138 --> 00:07:14,183
- FIVE POUNDS 
FOR EACH YEAR OF MY LIFE.

198
00:07:14,183 --> 00:07:15,851
narrator: SADLY, 
HE LOST THE USE OF HIS LEGS

199
00:07:15,851 --> 00:07:17,770
ON HIS 70th BIRTHDAY-- 
- RELEASE!

200
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:19,647
narrator: AT THE NEWLY-REMODELED 
JACK DORSO'S

201
00:07:19,647 --> 00:07:22,066
IN ALBANY, NEW YORK.

202
00:07:22,066 --> 00:07:23,317
[bones cracking]

203
00:07:23,317 --> 00:07:26,529
- [grunts] 
TOO MUCH!

204
00:07:26,529 --> 00:07:29,281
- IF HE'S GOT SO MUCH MONEY, HOW 
COME WE NEVER CALLED HIM BEFORE?

205
00:07:29,281 --> 00:07:30,533
- BUT I HAVE.

206
00:07:30,533 --> 00:07:32,159
I MEAN, THERE WOULDN'T BE 
A BLUTH COMPANY WITHOUT HIM.

207
00:07:32,159 --> 00:07:34,537
I COULD NEVER HAVE AFFORDED 
THAT FIRST TRACT OF LAND.

208
00:07:34,537 --> 00:07:36,539
BUT HE ALWAYS WANTS 
SOMETHING IN RETURN.

209
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:38,499
[sighs] 
I DON'T KNOW.

210
00:07:38,499 --> 00:07:40,751
SEE IF YOU CAN TALK YOUR MOTHER 
INTO TAKING ANOTHER BULLET

211
00:07:40,751 --> 00:07:44,254
FOR THE BLUTH FAMILY.

212
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:49,802
narrator: THE FAMILY 
GATHERED AT LUCILLE'S

213
00:07:49,802 --> 00:07:52,513
TO WELCOME AND SOLICIT 
UNCLE JACK.

214
00:07:52,513 --> 00:07:54,807
AND REMEMBER, 
HE WASN'T REALLY THEIR UNCLE.

215
00:07:54,807 --> 00:07:56,183
- BUSTER; NICE OF YOU 
TO TAKE A BREAK

216
00:07:56,183 --> 00:07:58,686
FROM THAT COMMON WHORE 
YOU'VE BEEN DATING.

217
00:07:58,686 --> 00:07:59,937
- SHE IS NOT A WHORE, MOTHER.

218
00:07:59,937 --> 00:08:03,190
SHE HAPPENS TO BE THE NEW 
SECRETARY OF THE BLUTH COMPANY.

219
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:08,028
AND, YES, SHE'S MORE EXPERIENCED 
THAN A NORMAL GIRL.

220
00:08:08,028 --> 00:08:09,697
BUT SOMETIMES LOVE 
SHOULD BE TERRIFYING.

221
00:08:09,697 --> 00:08:12,617
narrator: 
IN FACT,

222
00:08:12,617 --> 00:08:14,494
BUSTER HAD EVEN STARTED 
USING HIS ARMY STEALTH TRAINING.

223
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:15,661
- BUSTER.

224
00:08:15,661 --> 00:08:19,331
- I'LL BE RIGHT IN, AND THEN 
MAYBE WE CAN TALK ABOUT--

225
00:08:19,331 --> 00:08:22,585
[grunts] 
MAKIN' THAT LOVE.

226
00:08:22,585 --> 00:08:25,254
[door handle rattling]

227
00:08:25,254 --> 00:08:26,506
- I SHOULDN'T COMPLAIN.

228
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:30,885
IT'S BETTER THAN YOU DATING 
LUCILLE 2, THAT BITCH!

229
00:08:30,885 --> 00:08:32,136
- LUCILLE 2's NOT A "B," MOTHER.

230
00:08:32,136 --> 00:08:35,222
SHE'S KIND, AND SHE'S CARING,

231
00:08:35,222 --> 00:08:36,932
AND SHE'S CERTAINLY 
LESS EXPERIENCED THAN

232
00:08:36,932 --> 00:08:39,226
THAT WHORE THAT I'M DATING NOW.

233
00:08:39,226 --> 00:08:41,687
narrator: AND PERHAPS IT WAS 
SCREAMING IT OUT LOUD

234
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:43,856
THAT MADE BUSTER REALIZE 
THAT HE MISSED LUCILLE 2.

235
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:45,107
- I'M WONDERING 
IF YOU CAN KEEP

236
00:08:45,107 --> 00:08:47,234
SOME OF THE MORE 
PIERCING PROFANITIES DOWN

237
00:08:47,234 --> 00:08:49,236
WHEN THE 90-YEAR-OLD 
FITNESS BUFF GETS HERE?

238
00:08:49,236 --> 00:08:52,156
- YOU KNOW, MICHAEL, I WAS HAPPY 
TO CALL UNCLE JACK FOR YOU,

239
00:08:52,156 --> 00:08:54,575
BUT THAT'S AS MUCH 
AS I'M GOING TO DO.

240
00:08:54,575 --> 00:08:56,619
IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

241
00:08:56,619 --> 00:08:57,870
I NEED A MORE VITAL MAN.

242
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:59,246
[knocking at door]

243
00:08:59,246 --> 00:09:02,416
- SOMEONE ORDER 140 POUNDS 
OF UPPER-BODY STRENGTH?

244
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:05,670
- WELL, HE CERTAINLY 
SOUNDS VITAL TO ME.

245
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:08,255
- WALK, DRAGON! WALK!

246
00:09:08,255 --> 00:09:10,883
ENTER THE ROOM! 
- WELCOME, UNCLE JACK.

247
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:15,012
- HE'S HALF DEAF. 
IT WAS A STUPID, STUPID HIRE.

248
00:09:15,012 --> 00:09:18,766
NOT "HIGHER." 
EYE LEVEL! EYE LEVEL!

249
00:09:18,766 --> 00:09:21,727
KISSES, AND THEN WE TALK. 
WHICH ONE IS MICHAEL?

250
00:09:21,727 --> 00:09:25,606
- UH-- 
- SWOOP ME!

251
00:09:25,606 --> 00:09:26,857
- OH.

252
00:09:26,857 --> 00:09:28,984
- I, UH, REALLY APPRECIATE 
YOU COMING OVER, UNCLE JACK.

253
00:09:28,984 --> 00:09:31,821
- THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME. 
YOU MAY BE AMAZED.

254
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:35,616
I'M INVITED INTO 
VERY FEW PERSONAL HOMES.

255
00:09:35,616 --> 00:09:38,994
TO THE NUTS!

256
00:09:38,994 --> 00:09:43,207
THE BRIDGE MIX! 
THE BRIDGE MIX! FOOL!

257
00:09:43,207 --> 00:09:45,167
- HEY, FAKE UNCLE JACK.

258
00:09:45,167 --> 00:09:46,711
- IS THIS THE BOY? 
IS THIS THE LITTLE ONE?

259
00:09:46,711 --> 00:09:49,421
MY GOD, YOU'RE AN ARMY MAN.

260
00:09:49,421 --> 00:09:50,673
- WELL-- 
[chuckles]

261
00:09:50,673 --> 00:09:52,967
- I WAS NEVER IN THE ARMY. 
I WAS IN THE PICTURES.

262
00:09:52,967 --> 00:09:55,845
HERE COMES UNCLE JACK. 
SHOOT ME!

263
00:09:55,845 --> 00:09:57,096
- [screams] 
OH, GOD!

264
00:09:57,096 --> 00:09:58,388
- [gasps]

265
00:09:58,388 --> 00:09:59,640
- [groans]

266
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:02,309
- LOOK AT THAT. I PINNED HIM. 
I PINNED THE ARMY MAN.

267
00:10:02,309 --> 00:10:03,644
GOD BLESS YOU FOR BEING 
IN THE ARMY.

268
00:10:03,644 --> 00:10:06,856
UP, DRAGON!

269
00:10:06,856 --> 00:10:12,319
- [whimpering] 
- LIFT. LIFT WITH VIGOR.

270
00:10:12,319 --> 00:10:13,570
- REMEMBER ME?

271
00:10:13,570 --> 00:10:16,991
- LUCILLE. YOU LOOK YOUNGER 
THAN YOU DID THE DAY I--

272
00:10:16,991 --> 00:10:18,242
- OH, YOU OLD FOOL. 
I'M LUCILLE.

273
00:10:18,242 --> 00:10:21,621
- [screams] 
YOU LOOK FABULOUS.

274
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:26,917
BACK TO THE BLONDE. 
BACK TO THE BLONDE.

275
00:10:26,917 --> 00:10:30,170
ISN'T SHE BEAUTIFUL? 
OH, YEAH.

276
00:10:30,170 --> 00:10:32,339
[gobbling]

277
00:10:32,339 --> 00:10:34,133
- HE'S KIND OF SCARY, 
THAT GUY, HUH?

278
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:36,468
- NO, NOT TO ME. 
I THINK HE'S KIND OF COOL.

279
00:10:36,468 --> 00:10:37,845
- WELL, WHY DON'T YOU GO 
GET YOUR KISS

280
00:10:37,845 --> 00:10:38,971
FROM MR. COOL HALF-MAN?

281
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:40,264
- [scoffs] 
I'D BE FINE WITH THAT.

282
00:10:40,264 --> 00:10:41,348
- LET'S GO.

283
00:10:41,348 --> 00:10:43,350
- SO WHAT'S YOUR POINT? 
- COME ON.

284
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:45,560
- WHY, SHE'S NO BIGGER 
THAN ONE OF MY LEGS.

285
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:48,438
SHAKE THEM FOR HER. 
[grunting]

286
00:10:48,438 --> 00:10:50,691
- EXCUSE ME, UNCLE JACK. 
I'M GEORGE MICHAEL.

287
00:10:50,691 --> 00:10:53,360
- [gurgles] 
IT'S OKAY. JUST IGNORE IT!

288
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,611
IGNORE IT.

289
00:10:54,611 --> 00:10:56,280
JUST SOMETHING THE BODY DOES 
WHEN YOU'RE SHAKEN.

290
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:59,158
[gurgles] DON'T SHAKE IT! 
DON'T SHAKE IT!

291
00:10:59,158 --> 00:11:01,118
TOWEL! 
- NOT THE GOOD ONES!

292
00:11:01,118 --> 00:11:02,411
- IS HE DYING? 
WHAT IF HE'S DYING?

293
00:11:02,411 --> 00:11:03,495
- [gurgling]

294
00:11:03,495 --> 00:11:06,498
- BOY, THAT DRAGON'S CUTE, HUH? 
[sighs]

295
00:11:06,498 --> 00:11:08,458
- WHAT, THE DEAF GIANT 
WHO'S HOLDING OUR FAKE UNCLE?

296
00:11:08,458 --> 00:11:10,627
- HE'S BEEN FLIRTING 
WITH ME ALL NIGHT.

297
00:11:10,627 --> 00:11:13,463
I WAS THINKING MAYBE IT WOULD 
BE BEST FOR THE FAMILY

298
00:11:13,463 --> 00:11:17,092
IF I WENT ON THAT ROMANCE THING 
WITH DRAG INSTEAD OF TOBIAS,

299
00:11:17,092 --> 00:11:20,387
WHICH WOULD BE A DRAG. 
[chuckles]

300
00:11:20,387 --> 00:11:23,682
- YEAH, THAT'S JUST THE KIND 
OF JOKE DRAG CAN'T HEAR.

301
00:11:23,682 --> 00:11:25,434
NO, YOU'RE GONNA GO WITH TOBIAS 
OR NOT AT ALL.

302
00:11:25,434 --> 00:11:27,853
NOW TELL ME WHAT YOU FOUND OUT 
AT SITWELL.

303
00:11:27,853 --> 00:11:29,104
- OH. YOU STILL WANT ME 
TO DO THAT?

304
00:11:29,104 --> 00:11:30,522
- YOU DIDN'T?

305
00:11:30,522 --> 00:11:32,566
LINDSAY, I GIVE YOU ONE THING 
TO DO FOR THE BUSINESS,

306
00:11:32,566 --> 00:11:33,692
AND YOU CAN'T EVEN DO IT.

307
00:11:33,692 --> 00:11:35,652
I MEAN, IF YOU'D TRIED AND 
FAILED, I'D UNDERSTAND,

308
00:11:35,652 --> 00:11:36,821
BUT YOU DIDN'T EVEN TRY.

309
00:11:36,821 --> 00:11:38,072
- SO, I DIDN'T EVEN FAIL,

310
00:11:38,072 --> 00:11:40,699
AND I DON'T SEE YOU 
GIVING ME CREDIT FOR THAT.

311
00:11:40,699 --> 00:11:41,951
- [sighs]

312
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:44,661
narrator: MICHAEL KNEW THAT 
SINCE LINDSAY LET HIM DOWN,

313
00:11:44,661 --> 00:11:46,038
HE HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO ASK 
UNCLE JACK

314
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:50,417
FOR THE MONEY TO SAVE 
HIS COMPANY.

315
00:11:50,417 --> 00:11:53,087
- PRETTY. 
- YES.

316
00:11:53,087 --> 00:11:54,839
DO YOU THINK YOU SHOULD BE 
PERCHED ON THE EDGE

317
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:57,382
OF THE BUILDING LIKE THIS?

318
00:11:57,382 --> 00:12:02,179
- OH, DRAGON'S GOT ME.

319
00:12:02,179 --> 00:12:04,598
- DRAGON'S IN THE BATHROOM. 
- MAMA!

320
00:12:04,598 --> 00:12:06,016
- COME ON. I GOT YA. 
I GOT YA. IT'S OKAY.

321
00:12:06,016 --> 00:12:08,185
- [grunts, whimpers]

322
00:12:08,185 --> 00:12:10,020
narrator: AND SO MICHAEL 
LAID OUT HIS DILEMMA.

323
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:11,981
- I JUST DON'T WANT TO SEE 
THE FAMILY COMPANY GET RUINED.

324
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:13,648
- I WAS HOPING THAT 
THIS WAS A SOCIAL VISIT--

325
00:12:13,648 --> 00:12:16,944
- WELL--

326
00:12:16,944 --> 00:12:18,487
- PARTICULARLY WHEN 
THAT SISTER OF YOURS

327
00:12:18,487 --> 00:12:21,698
STARTED GIVING ME 
THE CUTIE EYE.

328
00:12:21,698 --> 00:12:23,492
[growling] 
- SHE DID?

329
00:12:23,492 --> 00:12:26,370
- UNFORTUNATELY 
THAT MOOSE WAS HOLDING ME,

330
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:28,747
SO I COULDN'T MAKE MY MOVE.

331
00:12:28,747 --> 00:12:30,916
OF COURSE I COULDN'T MAKE 
THAT MOVE WITHOUT THAT MOOSE,

332
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:33,502
BUT THAT'S MY CHALLENGE.

333
00:12:33,502 --> 00:12:36,171
I WON'T GO WHEELCHAIR!

334
00:12:36,171 --> 00:12:40,050
TWIRL ME AROUND.

335
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:43,345
- HEY, HEY. NO. 
I GOT YOU. I GOT YOU.

336
00:12:43,345 --> 00:12:45,597
- [chokes] 
- YOU ALL RIGHT?

337
00:12:45,597 --> 00:12:49,684
- BUT VALENTINE'S DAY IS HERE, 
AND I'M ALONE.

338
00:12:49,684 --> 00:12:51,728
THE MOOSE IS NO ONE.

339
00:12:51,728 --> 00:12:55,482
PERHAPS IF I HAD 
A LITTLE...COMPANIONSHIP,

340
00:12:55,482 --> 00:12:59,569
I'D BE A LITTLE 
MORE DISPOSED TO WHIP OUT

341
00:12:59,569 --> 00:13:02,197
THAT OLD WALLET OF MINE.

342
00:13:02,197 --> 00:13:04,867
- YOU'RE SAYING IF I WERE 
TO SET YOU UP WITH MY SISTER,

343
00:13:04,867 --> 00:13:06,243
YOU WOULD CONSIDER 
BAILING US OUT?

344
00:13:06,243 --> 00:13:08,578
- OH, JOY. YEAH.

345
00:13:08,578 --> 00:13:10,580
narrator: 
MICHAEL WAS TORN.

346
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:12,541
THE BUSINESS MEANT THE WORLD 
TO HIM, BUT HIS SISTER'S HONO-

347
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:13,583
- LET'S DO IT.

348
00:13:13,583 --> 00:13:16,420
narrator: UH, MEANT A LOT TOO. 
- LET'S GO SHARE THE GOOD NEWS.

349
00:13:22,092 --> 00:13:25,512
narrator: MICHAEL HAD OFFERED 
HIS SISTER TO HIS UNCLE JACK

350
00:13:25,512 --> 00:13:27,848
IN EXCHANGE FOR MONEY 
TO SAVE THE COMPANY.

351
00:13:27,848 --> 00:13:30,517
REMEMBER, 
IT'S NOT THEIR REAL UNCLE.

352
00:13:30,517 --> 00:13:33,728
- HE'S CUTE, ISN'T HE? 
- SO CUTE.

353
00:13:33,728 --> 00:13:34,939
- IMAGINE HIM WITHOUT 
THAT MUSCLY LITTLE OLD GUY

354
00:13:34,939 --> 00:13:36,857
IN HIS ARMS.

355
00:13:36,857 --> 00:13:37,858
- OH, DRAGON. RIGHT.

356
00:13:37,858 --> 00:13:39,109
WELL, THAT'S WHY 
I WAS THINKING

357
00:13:39,109 --> 00:13:42,321
MAYBE YOU SHOULD GO WITH DRAGON 
ON THAT ROMANTIC GETAWAY.

358
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:43,572
- OH.

359
00:13:43,572 --> 00:13:44,698
- NOW, I KNOW HE'S WORKING,

360
00:13:44,698 --> 00:13:47,117
SO UNCLE JACK'S 
GONNA HAVE TO GO ALONG.

361
00:13:47,117 --> 00:13:49,369
- OH. WELL, AS LONG AS 
HE PROMISES NOT TO SHAKE HIM.

362
00:13:49,369 --> 00:13:50,579
- MMM.

363
00:13:50,579 --> 00:13:51,914
- SO, WHAT DID HE SAY 
ABOUT THE MONEY?

364
00:13:51,914 --> 00:13:55,625
- HE SAID HE'D LIKE 
TO SLEEP ON IT.

365
00:13:55,625 --> 00:13:57,252
narrator: MEANWHILE, 
BUSTER HAD DECIDED

366
00:13:57,252 --> 00:13:59,671
TO PURSUE A NEW GIRLFRIEND:

367
00:13:59,671 --> 00:14:01,631
HIS OLD GIRLFRIEND.

368
00:14:01,631 --> 00:14:04,259
- HEY--BROTHER? 
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

369
00:14:04,259 --> 00:14:05,510
- I'M KEEPING AN EYE 
ON THE WOMAN

370
00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:06,929
WHO CONTROLS OUR COMPANY.

371
00:14:06,929 --> 00:14:09,056
- IN HER ROBE AND SLIPPIES?

372
00:14:09,056 --> 00:14:10,307
- GETTING INTO HER HEAD.

373
00:14:10,307 --> 00:14:11,600
I THINK SHE'S PLANNING 
ON SELLING

374
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,685
OUR COMPANY TO STAN SITWELL.

375
00:14:13,685 --> 00:14:14,937
BUT I'VE LOST HER TRAIL,

376
00:14:14,937 --> 00:14:17,647
AND I DON'T THINK I HAVE 
THE SKILLS TO PICK IT UP.

377
00:14:17,647 --> 00:14:21,235
- SKILLS? 
[grunts]

378
00:14:24,404 --> 00:14:29,118
- THESE KIND OF SKILLS? 
- NOT REALLY.

379
00:14:29,118 --> 00:14:30,660
BUT IF YOU GIVE ME ONE OF 
THOSE OUTFITS,

380
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:34,498
WE CAN HIDE IN THE BUSHES OR 
SOMETHING AND SPY ON THEM.

381
00:14:34,498 --> 00:14:37,667
- I WOULD LIKE TO SEE HER AGAIN. 
YOU'VE GOT IT.

382
00:14:37,667 --> 00:14:39,128
narrator: 
AND MICHAEL TOLD HIS FATHER

383
00:14:39,128 --> 00:14:41,421
THE GOOD NEWS ABOUT UNCLE JACK.

384
00:14:41,421 --> 00:14:42,756
-YOU ARE PIMPING OUT 
YOUR SISTER?

385
00:14:42,756 --> 00:14:44,549
- WELL, YOU WERE PIMPING OUT 
MY MOTHER.

386
00:14:44,549 --> 00:14:46,385
- YES, BECAUSE SHE WAS 
SLEEPING WITH MY BROTHER,

387
00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:48,178
BUT YOUR SISTER?

388
00:14:48,178 --> 00:14:50,931
- EVERYTHING'S GONNA BE FINE. 
NO ONE'S GONNA GET HURT.

389
00:14:50,931 --> 00:14:53,350
NO ONE IS GOING TO GET HURT.

390
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:54,601
- OH. HEY, MICHAEL.

391
00:14:54,601 --> 00:14:57,437
MY DAD WANTED ME TO THANK YOU 
FOR THE ROMANTIC GETAWAY.

392
00:14:57,437 --> 00:14:59,564
DON'T TELL ME WHAT THAT MEANS.

393
00:14:59,564 --> 00:15:00,815
- WHERE IS YOUR DAD?

394
00:15:00,815 --> 00:15:02,817
- HE LEFT, 
DRESSED ALL WESTERNY.

395
00:15:02,817 --> 00:15:04,778
YOU COULD LEAVE ME 
OUT OF THAT PART TOO.

396
00:15:04,778 --> 00:15:06,530
narrator: AND MICHAEL REALIZED 
THAT PERHAPS

397
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:08,240
SOMEBODY WOULD GET HURT.

398
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,658
- I JUST SCREWED 
MY BROTHER-IN-LAW.

399
00:15:09,658 --> 00:15:12,452
- WELL, I'M ALL GROWN UP NOW.

400
00:15:12,452 --> 00:15:15,122
narrator: SO MICHAEL RUSHED 
TO THE FOUR SEAS HOTEL

401
00:15:15,122 --> 00:15:18,458
TO KEEP TOBIAS FROM FINDING OT 
ABOUT LINDSAY'S DATE.

402
00:15:18,458 --> 00:15:21,503
- MICHAEL, THIS IS JEFF. 
HE DOES ALL THE HORSE WORK HERE.

403
00:15:21,503 --> 00:15:22,796
YOU'LL MEET HIM AGAIN 
AT THE END.

404
00:15:22,796 --> 00:15:24,464
PLUS, HE GETS YOU YOUR JUICE.

405
00:15:24,464 --> 00:15:27,467
NOT YOUR FIRST JUICE, 
BUT THE ONE YOU GET AT THE SPA.

406
00:15:27,467 --> 00:15:29,094
- THAT'S RIGHT. 
YOU'VE DONE THIS BEFORE.

407
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:30,930
- BUT NOT WITH A LOVELY LADY.

408
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:32,639
JEFF DOUBTS ONE'S COMING 
AT ALL, DON'T YOU?

409
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:35,350
SORRY. SORRY.

410
00:15:35,350 --> 00:15:38,895
- ABOUT THE LOVELY LADY--

411
00:15:38,895 --> 00:15:43,400
- STOP. YOU DROPPED THE BOOT. 
DROPPED THE BOOT.

412
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,235
narrator: MICHAEL CAME UP WITH 
THE ONLY EVASION

413
00:15:45,235 --> 00:15:47,154
HE COULD THINK OF.

414
00:15:47,154 --> 00:15:49,281
- TOBIAS, THE LOVELY LADY, SHE'S 
GONNA BE A LITTLE BIT LATE.

415
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:50,324
SHE'S DOING SOME WORK.

416
00:15:50,324 --> 00:15:52,367
SHE SAID TO GET STARTED 
WITHOUT HER.

417
00:15:52,367 --> 00:15:53,618
SADDLE ME UP, JEFF.

418
00:15:53,618 --> 00:15:55,829
- IT'S GONNA TAKE A FEW MINUTES 
TO TACK ANOTHER HORSE.

419
00:15:55,829 --> 00:15:58,123
narrator: SO MICHAEL EMBARKED 
ON THE ROMANTIC ADVENTURE

420
00:15:58,123 --> 00:16:01,168
HE'D SPENT SO LAVISHLY FOR.

421
00:16:01,168 --> 00:16:03,253
- WELL, YOU CERTAINLY 
DIDN'T HELP WITH MY REPUTATION

422
00:16:03,253 --> 00:16:05,005
AS A LADY'S MAN WITH JEFF.

423
00:16:05,005 --> 00:16:07,799
BUT WE'LL CLEAR ALL THAT UP 
IN THE SPA WHEN I GET MY FACIAL.

424
00:16:07,799 --> 00:16:10,427
- HEY, DID YOU EVER GET 
THAT TAPE RECORDER?

425
00:16:10,427 --> 00:16:11,678
- [chuckles] 
YOU'RE FUNNY.

426
00:16:11,678 --> 00:16:14,514
COME ON, BOY. 
HOO-CHA-CHA!

427
00:16:14,514 --> 00:16:18,185
narrator: SOON THE NEXT GROUP 
BEGAN THEIR ROMANTIC DATE.

428
00:16:18,185 --> 00:16:19,811
- SO NICE OF YOU 
TO COVER THIS, UNCLE JACK.

429
00:16:19,811 --> 00:16:20,980
- MY PLEASURE.

430
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:23,315
IT'S NICE TO DO SOMETHING 
YOU DON'T NEED LEGS FOR.

431
00:16:23,315 --> 00:16:25,025
[yells]

432
00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:32,407
[spits, gurgles] 
TOWEL!

433
00:16:32,407 --> 00:16:36,203
narrator: AND LUCILLE 2 SHOWED 
UP WITH STAN SITWELL,

434
00:16:36,203 --> 00:16:38,830
WHO DID LOOK A LITTLE 
LIKE EDGAR WINTER.

435
00:16:38,830 --> 00:16:40,082
AND ONE BY ONE,

436
00:16:40,082 --> 00:16:44,836
THEY EACH ENJOYED THE ACTIVITIES 
OF THEIR ROMANTIC GETAWAYS.

437
00:16:44,836 --> 00:16:47,297
- BODY CHOCOLATE? 
- NO.

438
00:16:47,297 --> 00:16:49,341
narrator: 
OF COURSE, IN THE SPA,

439
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:54,388
THE JETS PROVED TOO POWERFUL 
FOR UNCLE JACK'S TINY LEGS.

440
00:16:54,388 --> 00:16:56,015
THE SPA PORTION 
ALSO PROVED CHALLENGING

441
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:59,393
TO STAN SITWELL AND LUCILLE 2,

442
00:16:59,393 --> 00:17:04,231
WHO IN TURN 
WERE BEING FOLLOWED BY BUSTER

443
00:17:04,231 --> 00:17:07,734
AND GOB.

444
00:17:07,734 --> 00:17:08,985
AND SOON, MICHAEL AND TOBIAS

445
00:17:08,985 --> 00:17:10,362
AWAITED 
THEIR MASSAGE THERAPISTS.

446
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:11,613
- [humming]

447
00:17:11,613 --> 00:17:13,532
- SO, UH, TOBIAS, 
I'M AFRAID THAT YOUR WIFE

448
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:16,910
MIGHT NOT ACTUALLY 
END UP HERE WITH YOU.

449
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:18,162
- YOU KNOW, MICHAEL,

450
00:17:18,162 --> 00:17:20,705
PERHAPS I SHOULD BUY YOU 
THAT TAPE RECORDER.

451
00:17:20,705 --> 00:17:23,625
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA HOW OFTEN 
YOU SAY THE WORD "AFRAID"?

452
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:25,710
- WELL, I KNOW I USED IT 
IN THE JACUZZI.

453
00:17:25,710 --> 00:17:28,755
- AND I APOLOGIZE FOR THAT. 
I THOUGHT IT WAS A POOL TOY.

454
00:17:28,755 --> 00:17:31,633
BUT YOU WERE SUPPOSED 
TO BE HERE WITH SALLY SITWELL,

455
00:17:31,633 --> 00:17:34,469
BUT YOU WERE AFRAID 
TO ASK HER.

456
00:17:34,469 --> 00:17:35,720
SO WHAT DO YOU DO?

457
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:38,390
YOU CREATE ISSUES, AND YOU 
MAKE UP IMAGINARY PROBLEMS,

458
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:41,643
LIKE THIS MERGER 
I HEAR YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT.

459
00:17:41,643 --> 00:17:44,063
- WELL, UH, 
YOU'RE PROBABLY RIGHT--

460
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:45,314
- [shouting]

461
00:17:45,314 --> 00:17:47,732
- ABOUT ME BEING AFRAID 
OF THE WORD "NO," BUT--

462
00:17:47,732 --> 00:17:50,402
YOU KNOW, THE MERGER'S REAL. 
I'M NOT IMAGINING THAT.

463
00:17:50,402 --> 00:17:52,946
- LUCILLE! 
MICHAEL.

464
00:17:52,946 --> 00:17:55,074
MICHAEL? 
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

465
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:58,034
- FOLLOWING LUCILLE 2. 
SHE'S WITH SITWELL.

466
00:17:58,034 --> 00:18:00,454
SHE PROBABLY FIGURED 
THAT WE'D NEVER TRACK HER.

467
00:18:00,454 --> 00:18:01,705
[chuckles] 
BUT WE LOST HER.

468
00:18:01,705 --> 00:18:04,083
EVERYONE PUT ON WHITE ROBES 
AND OUTSMARTED US.

469
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:07,086
- LUCILLE! 
LINDSAY?

470
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:09,796
- [grunts] 
- LINDSAY.

471
00:18:09,796 --> 00:18:13,049
- WAIT, WAIT, WAIT. 
LINDSAY'S HERE? WITH TWO MEN?

472
00:18:13,049 --> 00:18:15,009
- SORT OF ONE AND A HALF.

473
00:18:15,009 --> 00:18:18,888
- TOBIAS. 
HEY, TOBIAS!

474
00:18:18,888 --> 00:18:21,641
- LINDSAY, LOOK. I--OH. 
LUCILLE 2. I'M SORRY.

475
00:18:21,641 --> 00:18:22,892
AND, MISS, 
I DON'T KNOW YOUR NAME.

476
00:18:22,892 --> 00:18:23,977
- TOBIAS?

477
00:18:23,977 --> 00:18:26,271
- LUCILLE? SITWELL? 
WHAT'S THIS?

478
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:28,357
- IT'S OUR ROMANTIC GETAWAY, 
MICHAEL.

479
00:18:28,357 --> 00:18:31,651
- ROMANTIC? SO, THEN THE COMPANY 
ISN'T BEING TAKEN OVER,

480
00:18:31,651 --> 00:18:34,363
SO LINDSAY DOESN'T HAVE 
TO BE WITH UNCLE JACK?

481
00:18:34,363 --> 00:18:38,074
OH, TOBIAS. 
WE GOTTA STOP LINDS--TOBIAS?

482
00:18:38,074 --> 00:18:39,493
- HOW'D YOU LIKE TO TAKE 
A NAP, BALDY?

483
00:18:39,493 --> 00:18:41,203
- I'LL HANDLE THIS.

484
00:18:41,203 --> 00:18:44,373
- SHE'S MY GIRLFRIEND, PAL. 
TAKE HIM DOWN, BUSTER.

485
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:45,624
- YOUR GIRLFRIEND?

486
00:18:45,624 --> 00:18:47,792
THAT'S WHY YOU WERE 
IN HER ROBE AND SLIPPIES.

487
00:18:47,792 --> 00:18:50,129
YOU WEREN'T TRYING 
TO GET INTO HER HEAD.

488
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:53,132
YOU WERE TRYING TO GET INTO 
HER... ROBE AND SLIPPIES.

489
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:56,009
SHE'S MY GIRLFRIEND! 
[yells]

490
00:18:56,009 --> 00:18:59,095
[both grunting]

491
00:18:59,095 --> 00:19:01,765
- SO THIS IS 
WHO YOU CHOOSE OVER ME?

492
00:19:01,765 --> 00:19:05,644
- [grunts] SHE'S NOT WITH HIM. 
SHE'S WITH THE BULLET.

493
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:07,687
- OH, THANK GOD.

494
00:19:07,687 --> 00:19:10,440
- BUT IF YOU WANT A FIGHT, 
YOU GOT IT.

495
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:11,250
SHOOT ME!

496
00:19:14,736 --> 00:19:18,823
- STOP IT! STOP IT!

497
00:19:18,823 --> 00:19:20,534
LOOK, I WASN'T TRYING 
TO SELL YOUR COMPANY,

498
00:19:20,534 --> 00:19:23,245
BUT I AM NOW.

499
00:19:23,245 --> 00:19:26,165
THE HELL WITH ALL OF YOU!

500
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:28,167
- I'M GONNA TRY AND LOWBALL HER.

501
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:33,380
- NOT WHILE WE'RE AROUND. 
- WE'RE NOT DONE HERE, GOB!

502
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:36,216
- TOBIAS? 
TOBIAS, I'M SORRY.

503
00:19:36,216 --> 00:19:39,135
I SET THIS UP FOR LINDSAY. 
LINDSAY, I'M SORRY.

504
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:40,512
- YOU WERE NOT ON A DATE 
WITH DRAGON.

505
00:19:40,512 --> 00:19:42,181
- I KNOW THAT, MICHAEL.

506
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:44,015
IT WAS PRETTY OBVIOUS WHEN 
DRAGON KEPT SWOOPING

507
00:19:44,015 --> 00:19:45,309
UNCLE JACK IN FOR A KISS.

508
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:47,101
YOU SAID I NEVER DID 
ANYTHING FOR THE COMPANY.

509
00:19:47,101 --> 00:19:48,853
I-I JUST THOUGHT I'D TRY.

510
00:19:48,853 --> 00:19:53,400
TOBIAS, I NEVER THOUGHT 
YOU'D EVER FIGHT FOR ME.

511
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,651
- I HAD NO IDEA 
A 90-YEAR-OLD MAN

512
00:19:54,651 --> 00:19:57,946
COULD CAVE IN MY CHEST CAVITY 
LIKE THAT.

513
00:19:57,946 --> 00:20:02,826
- DRAGON, WOULD YOU MIND 
CARRYING MY HUSBAND TO THE CAR?

514
00:20:02,826 --> 00:20:04,869
- [bones cracking] 
[screaming]

515
00:20:04,869 --> 00:20:07,206
- OH, GOD.

516
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:11,000
- I LOVE TAKIN' A GUY DOWN!

517
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,503
I THINK I SNAPPED ONE 
OF HIS RIBS.

518
00:20:13,503 --> 00:20:16,215
NO. IT'S MY LEG.

519
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:18,633
I'LL BET THAT WOULD HURT.

520
00:20:18,633 --> 00:20:19,884
- I GUESS THE DEAL'S OFF NOW,

521
00:20:19,884 --> 00:20:21,720
NOW THAT I ACTUALLY 
NEED YOU TO HELP US OUT?

522
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:22,971
- I'LL MAKE YOU A DEAL.

523
00:20:22,971 --> 00:20:25,098
YOU CARRY ME, 
AND I'LL CARRY YOU.

524
00:20:25,098 --> 00:20:27,434
- THANKS, UNCLE JACK.

525
00:20:27,434 --> 00:20:30,729
- YEAH, I THINK WE SHOULD 
GET TO THE HOSPITAL.

526
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:32,272
I THINK THIS DUCT TAPE 
IS THE ONLY THING

527
00:20:32,272 --> 00:20:34,233
THAT'S KEEPING THE ANKLE ON.

528
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:35,484
OKAY. AH. 
RIGHT AROUND THERE.

529
00:20:35,484 --> 00:20:38,903
OH. I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT 
INSIDE ME NOW.

530
00:20:38,903 --> 00:20:40,572
narrator: ON THE NEXT 
"ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT."

531
00:20:40,572 --> 00:20:42,866
UNCLE JACK BUYS THE COMPANY,

532
00:20:42,866 --> 00:20:44,909
BUT MAKES SOME CHANGES 
OF HIS OWN.

533
00:20:44,909 --> 00:20:47,912
- AND HE'S GONNA 
MAKE ME PRESIDENT.

534
00:20:47,912 --> 00:20:49,914
[chuckles]

535
00:20:49,914 --> 00:20:52,917
narrator: TOBIAS LISTENS TO 
A DAY'S WORTH OF HIS OWN WORDS

536
00:20:52,917 --> 00:20:54,378
TO SEE WHAT MICHAEL 
WAS REFERRING TO.

537
00:20:54,378 --> 00:20:55,504
[tape fast forwarding]

538
00:20:55,504 --> 00:20:58,882
- EVEN IF IT MEANS ME TAKING 
A CHUBBY, I WILL SUCK IT UP.

539
00:20:58,882 --> 00:21:00,133
NOTHING WRONG WITH THAT.

540
00:21:00,133 --> 00:21:02,344
OH, I'VE BEEN IN 
THE FILM BUSINESS FOR A WHILE,

541
00:21:02,344 --> 00:21:04,763
BUT I JUST CAN'T SEEM 
TO GET ONE IN THE CAN.

542
00:21:04,763 --> 00:21:06,180
IT'S OUT OF CONTEXT.

543
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:09,601
I WOULDN'T MIND KISSING THAT IN 
BETWEEN THE CHEEKS, SO TO SPEAK.

544
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:11,895
narrator: AND HE REALIZES 
THERE IS SOMETHING DISTINCT

545
00:21:11,895 --> 00:21:13,355
ABOUT THE WAY HE SPEAKS.

546
00:21:13,355 --> 00:21:17,442
- TOBIAS, YOU BLOWHARD! 
[chuckles]
