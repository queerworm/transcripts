NARRATOR:<i> George Sr. had come</i>
<i>to a political fund-raiser</i>

00:00:15,041 --> 00:00:17,875

3

NARRATOR:<i> ...that some</i>

5
00:00:21,583 --> 00:00:23,208

-Was your idea.

-NARRATOR:<i> ...even though</i>
he himself... 
-Oh. Tender.

7
00:00:26,125 --> 00:00:28,000

<i>by the day.</i>

8
00:00:28,041 --> 00:00:29,625
Curious feeling.

9
00:00:29,667 --> 00:00:31,834
<i>But he tried to muster</i>
<i>the old self-confidence</i>

10
00:00:31,875 --> 00:00:33,709
<i>for his face time</i>
<i>with Herbert Love.</i>

11
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:36,083
GEORGE SR.: And I-I just think
there will be a lot of support

12
00:00:36,125 --> 00:00:38,959
flowing in this relationship,
and your base...

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,792
You got a point
behind all those teeth of yours?

14
00:00:40,834 --> 00:00:42,709
(laughs)
If you support the wall,

15
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:44,041
I'll give you
a piece of the action.

16
00:00:44,083 --> 00:00:46,041
-Action? Action Jackson?
-Yeah.

17
00:00:46,083 --> 00:00:48,208
-Yes, sir. 
-What do I look like,
Carl Weathers to you?

18
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:50,709
-Oh, no, no.
-NARRATOR:<i> Not at all.</i>

19
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:52,709
-No. 
<i>-This, of course,</i>
is Herbert Love.

20
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:54,041
<i>My name is Herbert Love,</i>
<i>and I want you</i>

21
00:00:54,083 --> 00:00:55,709
<i>to say "high-low"</i>
<i>to my low-high plan.</i>

22
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:57,542
<i>A candidate</i>
<i>whose campaign slogan</i>

23
00:00:57,583 --> 00:01:00,875
<i>was embraced by everyone</i>
<i>from the very wealthy...</i>

24
00:01:00,917 --> 00:01:02,291
<i>And who doesn't want</i>

25
00:01:02,333 --> 00:01:04,667
<i>...to their bankers</i>

26
00:01:04,709 --> 00:01:07,291
<i>High-low, high-low,</i>

27

<i>My name is Herbert Love,</i>

28
00:01:08,709 --> 00:01:10,875
<i>and I most definitely</i>
<i>approve this message.</i>

29
00:01:10,917 --> 00:01:13,917
Do I look like someone
who eats at CW Swappigans?

30
00:01:13,959 --> 00:01:15,542
See, I stand for three things:

31
00:01:15,583 --> 00:01:18,000
one, getting
Barack Hussein Obama

32
00:01:18,041 --> 00:01:21,041
Wama Comma Mama on a Llama
out of office...

33
00:01:21,083 --> 00:01:23,291
It's a crazy-town name.

34
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:25,041
Two, low taxes
for high income earners.

35
00:01:25,083 --> 00:01:26,208
That's my low-high plan.

36
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:28,667
-I know it.
-And three,

37
00:01:28,709 --> 00:01:30,291
getting a little something
in my slushie fund

38
00:01:30,333 --> 00:01:32,000
so that I'm nice and loose

39
00:01:32,041 --> 00:01:33,875
and can help make
numbers one and two happen.

40
00:01:33,917 --> 00:01:36,667
I don't want to be the one to
say it, but I happen to be fond

41
00:01:36,709 --> 00:01:38,792
of redheads and greenbacks.

42
00:01:38,834 --> 00:01:40,208
-NARRATOR:<i> George Sr.</i>
had neither. -Oh, I-I...

43
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:42,041
-How would you like both?
-Get it for me tonight,

44
00:01:42,083 --> 00:01:43,542
and I'll make your wall thing

45
00:01:43,583 --> 00:01:45,041
the third point
of my three-point plan.

46
00:01:45,083 --> 00:01:46,792
All I got right now is:
"You want to reach

47
00:01:46,834 --> 00:01:49,625
"your hand into my pocket
to pay for your birth control?

48
00:01:49,667 --> 00:01:52,625
I get to put my hand
in your pocket to put it in."

49
00:01:52,667 --> 00:01:54,709
But when unveiled it
in Garden Grove,

50
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:56,834
I had to duck a
woman's pump and a mini pizza.

51
00:01:56,875 --> 00:01:58,709
Oops.

52
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:00,166
NARRATOR:
<i>Coming up with money, however,</i>

53
00:02:00,208 --> 00:02:02,125

<i>earlier that day,</i>

58
00:02:10,083 --> 00:02:11,542
Have you baked your brain

59
00:02:11,583 --> 00:02:13,125
<i>...to a brother</i>
<i>who lied to him...</i>

60
00:02:13,166 --> 00:02:14,250
So he only did buy that land
for personal gain.

61
00:02:14,291 --> 00:02:16,208
Well... Oscar.

62
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:18,041
-(chuckles) Oscar.
<i>-...Oscar chose to lie</i>

63
00:02:18,083 --> 00:02:20,667
<i>-with George's wife. </i>
-Call me Father B.

64
00:02:20,709 --> 00:02:24,625
<i>And, although too explicit</i>
<i>for an American audience,</i>

65
00:02:24,667 --> 00:02:27,542
<i>the lovemaking was intense</i>

68
00:02:33,291 --> 00:02:35,125
No. I-I mean...

69
00:02:35,166 --> 00:02:36,792
it's good to be out of that

70
00:02:36,834 --> 00:02:38,583
sweaty old hot box
at the compound.

71
00:02:38,625 --> 00:02:40,834
No, this was am...
this was amazing.

74
00:02:44,083 --> 00:02:47,041
...we may need to have
a president ready to go

75

if something should happen
to Lucille 2

76
00:02:49,041 --> 00:02:50,750
while we're building the wall.

77
00:02:50,792 --> 00:02:52,709
So we are building a wall.

78
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:54,208
Right where Oscar

79
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:56,542
thought he would be spending
the rest of his life.

80
00:02:56,583 --> 00:02:58,083
(Lucille laughs)

81
00:02:58,125 --> 00:03:00,667
Turn him around three times
and put him in Fullerton,

82
00:03:00,709 --> 00:03:02,125
-he won't know the difference.
-Fullerton.

83
00:03:02,166 --> 00:03:05,834
You know, I think we should
send our son down there.

84
00:03:05,875 --> 00:03:08,792
Give him some training,
show that he has a job,

85
00:03:08,834 --> 00:03:10,000
let him sweat a little.

86
00:03:10,041 --> 00:03:11,208
Buster? No, no.

87
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:12,625
I won't... I won't hear of it.

88
00:03:12,667 --> 00:03:13,834
It could kill him.

89
00:03:13,875 --> 00:03:15,542
I meant Gob.

90
00:03:15,583 --> 00:03:17,000
Oh. Oh, fine.

91
00:03:17,041 --> 00:03:19,667
Yeah, send him down.
I love that.

Oh, no, not in one of ours.

I mean, not...
not-not that you'll die,

-Brr, you know?
-Hmm.

107
00:04:00,291 --> 00:04:02,041
Well, I'll think about it.

Oh, I'm so sorry.

I haven't seen you

127
00:04:42,834 --> 00:04:46,166
Yeah, the first four months,
I was in denial. How are you?

Are... are you good?

129
00:04:47,667 --> 00:04:49,250
Do you have any money?

130

Not really.

a $50,000 check

133

your wife sent to my daughter
for plastic surgery.

00:04:59,917 --> 00:05:02,041
I thought there
was no money left.

Oh, no. Oh, no.

No, thank God.

You don't think Maisie's cuter?

143

I want to take this,

What the (bleep)
is he smiling about?

171
00:06:23,166 --> 00:06:24,792
Hello!

172
00:06:24,834 --> 00:06:26,542
Oh, we're just doing a survey

173
00:06:26,583 --> 00:06:27,875
for the U.S. government, ma'am.

174
00:06:27,917 --> 00:06:30,041
(laughing):
Oh, no, I-I'm a man.

175
00:06:30,083 --> 00:06:32,792
I was just wearing,
uh, this blouse

176
00:06:32,834 --> 00:06:35,667
because I was, uh, driving
and I hate my arms.

177
00:06:35,709 --> 00:06:36,959
What's the tape for?

178
00:06:37,041 --> 00:06:38,542
Laying out border coordinates

179
00:06:38,583 --> 00:06:40,166
for when they put up the wall.

180
00:06:40,208 --> 00:06:42,583
Shh! You're not supposed
to tell them what it's for.

181
00:06:42,625 --> 00:06:44,000
Well, he already
mentioned the tape,

182
00:06:44,041 --> 00:06:45,542
and he looks American.

183
00:06:45,583 --> 00:06:47,250
-Yeah, but he's in Mexico.
-Wait.

184
00:06:47,291 --> 00:06:49,166
Guys, no, no, Mexico starts

185
00:06:49,208 --> 00:06:51,041
-back there, by the gully.
-Whoever told you that's

186
00:06:51,083 --> 00:06:53,208
probably chomping on the maca,
if you know what I mean.

187
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:54,834
So, what you're saying
to me is that

188
00:06:54,875 --> 00:06:57,208
on this side of the tape,
I'm in Mexico,

189
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:59,041
but when I come over here...

190
00:06:59,083 --> 00:07:01,542
Whoa. We're going to need
to see a passport, sir.

191
00:07:01,583 --> 00:07:03,542
<i>Pasaporte.</i>

192
00:07:03,583 --> 00:07:05,250
NARRATOR:<i> George Sr.</i>
<i>liked to make men</i>

193
00:07:05,291 --> 00:07:07,709
<i>who disappoint him suffer.</i>

194
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:09,542
<i>But things change.</i>

195
00:07:09,583 --> 00:07:12,000
You really hurt
my feelings, guys.

196
00:07:12,041 --> 00:07:14,542
-No hugging... ma'am.
-I'm sorry.

197
00:07:14,583 --> 00:07:17,333
(George Sr. sobbing)

198
00:07:19,166 --> 00:07:21,250
NARRATOR:<i> George Sr.</i>
<i>had just discovered</i>

199
00:07:21,291 --> 00:07:23,542
<i>that the millions of dollars</i>
<i>of American property</i>

200
00:07:23,583 --> 00:07:25,417
<i>he owned was worthless.</i>

201
00:07:25,458 --> 00:07:27,125
How did you not notice?

202
00:07:27,166 --> 00:07:28,792
You saw all the papers.

203
00:07:28,834 --> 00:07:30,166
NARRATOR:
<i>And in Mexico.</i>

204
00:07:30,208 --> 00:07:32,417
You can't expect me to read
every page of that deal.

205
00:07:32,458 --> 00:07:34,709
Besides, that one
was particularly difficult

206
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:36,000
because it was all in Spanish.

207
00:07:36,041 --> 00:07:38,583
<i>It says very clearly,</i>
<i>on my business card,</i>

208
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:40,917
<i>"Se habla español."</i>

209
00:07:40,959 --> 00:07:42,542
"I do not speak Spanish."

210
00:07:42,583 --> 00:07:43,709
And it was your brother Oscar

211
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:45,250
who told me it
was on the border.

212
00:07:45,291 --> 00:07:46,917
How did he not know?

213
00:07:46,959 --> 00:07:49,166
NARRATOR:<i> Unfortunately,</i>
<i>Oscar missed the signs.</i>

214
00:07:49,208 --> 00:07:51,208
You think it's okay
to burn these?

215
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:52,709
OSCAR:
Well, this is America.

216
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:54,208
If they don't want us
to burn signs,

217
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:56,208
they shouldn't write them
in Spanish.

218
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:59,834
-Everybody!
<i>-♪ Sign, sign,</i>
<i>everywhere a sign... ♪</i>

219
00:07:59,875 --> 00:08:01,917
NARRATOR:
<i>Only Heartfire knew the truth.</i>

220
00:08:01,959 --> 00:08:05,875
<i>But the singing was so loud,</i>
<i>no one could hear her thoughts.</i>

221
00:08:05,917 --> 00:08:07,959
I bribed Love

222
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,417
to push for the building
of the wall,

223
00:08:10,458 --> 00:08:12,375
and I don't have the land
to build it on!

224
00:08:12,417 --> 00:08:14,208
BARRY: Shh, shh, shh.
Call Herbert Love, all right?

225
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:16,250
Tell him you would
greatly appreciate it

226
00:08:16,291 --> 00:08:18,709
if he'd rescind his support
for the wall.

227
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:20,792
And make him a flip-flopper?
I can't do that.

228
00:08:20,834 --> 00:08:22,250
NARRATOR:
<i>Actually, he'd tried,</i>

229
00:08:22,291 --> 00:08:23,750
<i>but couldn't afford it.</i>

230
00:08:23,792 --> 00:08:25,917
It's a 40 for the flip
and a 40 for the flop,

231
00:08:25,959 --> 00:08:28,667
and since it's going to cause
a flap, I'd say another 40.

232
00:08:28,709 --> 00:08:32,458
So it's a flat 40-40-40
flip-flop and a flap fee.

233
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:35,208
Well, then find someone
who has influence with him.

234
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:36,625
Hold on.
A client is, uh, coming,

235
00:08:36,667 --> 00:08:38,291
and I don't know where Oscar is.

236
00:08:38,333 --> 00:08:39,500
He's disappeared.

237
00:08:39,542 --> 00:08:41,500
And there is something up
with him

238
00:08:41,542 --> 00:08:43,542
because he is scary now.

239
00:08:43,583 --> 00:08:44,875
He has changed.

240
00:08:44,917 --> 00:08:46,792
Hey, you've changed,
you big (bleep).

241
00:08:46,834 --> 00:08:48,375
You're acting
like a little girl lately.

242
00:08:48,417 --> 00:08:49,667
And not in the good way.

243
00:08:49,709 --> 00:08:51,417
Pull yourself together.
Act like a man.

244
00:08:51,458 --> 00:08:52,709
GEORGE SR.:
You're right, you're right.

245
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:56,000
-Okay, love you.
-Love you, too. Bye.

246
00:08:56,041 --> 00:08:57,750
Cash, no receipt.

247
00:08:57,792 --> 00:08:59,583
-Hot day, Father.
-Hot day, Father B.

248
00:08:59,625 --> 00:09:01,542
-Hot day.
-Hot day, Father.

249
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:03,625
Hello, Father.

250
00:09:03,667 --> 00:09:04,834
Don't call me that!

251
00:09:04,875 --> 00:09:06,208
What are you doing here?

252
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:08,208
-You and Mom talked about it.
-We did...?

253
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:09,834
Oscar.

254
00:09:09,875 --> 00:09:12,625
NARRATOR:<i> In fact, it was Oscar</i>
<i>who spoke to Lucille</i>

255
00:09:12,667 --> 00:09:16,208
<i>about hiring Gob, but not</i>
<i>before an ominous warning.</i>

256
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:19,834
But, you know,
he has magical abilities.

257
00:09:19,875 --> 00:09:22,917
He can handle a lot more
than we give him credit for.

258
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:25,667
I know... What?!

259
00:09:25,709 --> 00:09:27,792
I would have been here sooner,
but I had to go down

260
00:09:27,834 --> 00:09:29,500
to San Diego
and loop my way back up

261
00:09:29,542 --> 00:09:31,291
because they put up
that border ribbon.

262
00:09:31,333 --> 00:09:32,750
-Which is totally new,
-Shh!

263
00:09:32,792 --> 00:09:34,333
and I wasn't expecting it;
it's fine.

264
00:09:34,375 --> 00:09:36,000
Anyway, Father,
you've got to get me a job

265
00:09:36,041 --> 00:09:38,291
so I can be prepared...
to be president.

266
00:09:38,333 --> 00:09:40,625
All right, you got to keep this
"father" stuff to yourself.

267
00:09:40,667 --> 00:09:43,041
I can't have these people think
that I raised a limo driver.

268
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:44,792
I'm not a limo driver.

269
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:46,542
I'm a gentleman honey farmer.

270
00:09:46,583 --> 00:09:48,583
The only thing I've got
back there are my bees.

271
00:09:48,625 --> 00:09:49,875
-Beans?
-No, bees!

272
00:09:49,917 --> 00:09:51,667
-Bees?
-Bees!

273
00:09:51,709 --> 00:09:53,750
Bees! Oh, bees!

274
00:09:53,792 --> 00:09:55,709
The boxes fell over
on the way here

275
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:57,125
when I had to swerve
to avoid an ostrich.

276
00:09:57,166 --> 00:09:59,000
You got to do something
about this-- these people

277
00:09:59,041 --> 00:10:00,208
paid a lot of money.
Do something!

278
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:01,583
No, they won't listen to me.

279
00:10:01,625 --> 00:10:03,083
-They've all got CCD.
-CCD?

280
00:10:03,125 --> 00:10:04,542
Colony collapse disorder.

281
00:10:04,583 --> 00:10:06,250
The guy sold me
just really sick bees.

282
00:10:06,291 --> 00:10:08,000
Don't worry.
Dad, they're going to hive.

283
00:10:08,041 --> 00:10:09,291
They always hive.

284
00:10:09,333 --> 00:10:11,125
NARRATOR:
<i>Usually by seeking out</i>

285
00:10:11,166 --> 00:10:12,959
<i>a structure</i>
<i>that most resembles a hive.</i>

286
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Bees! Wonderful bees!

287
00:10:16,041 --> 00:10:18,208
GEORGE SR.: It's okay.
It's okay. Gob, get in there

288
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:20,041
-and get them out!
-GOB: Okay, I'm on it.

289
00:10:20,083 --> 00:10:21,959
NARRATOR:<i> But then George Sr.</i>
<i>got some more bad news.</i>

290
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,208
OSCAR: Hello, brother.
Thought I'd find you

291
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:25,917
in a blouse and a beekeeper hat.

292
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:27,542
What are you doing here?
No, no, no, no, no.

293
00:10:27,583 --> 00:10:29,041
We cannot be seen
next to each other.

294
00:10:29,083 --> 00:10:30,417
I'm Dr. Norman!

295
00:10:30,458 --> 00:10:32,750
Well, if you don't want
to be seen, then you

296
00:10:32,792 --> 00:10:35,083
go in the sweat lodge.
You owe me.

297
00:10:35,125 --> 00:10:37,542
Is that a fact?
Listen, you told me

298
00:10:37,583 --> 00:10:39,583
the property was on the border.

299
00:10:39,625 --> 00:10:42,542
It is 50 feet south
of the border, Oscar.

300
00:10:42,583 --> 00:10:46,041
Well, excuse me, but they hadn't
put up the tape yet.

301
00:10:46,083 --> 00:10:48,542
So I was going off Buster's map.

302
00:10:48,583 --> 00:10:50,208
Oh, God, it was Buster's map.

303
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:52,166
NARRATOR:
<i>Buster had indeed made the map,</i>

304
00:10:52,208 --> 00:10:53,959
<i>as a cartography student,</i>

305
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,667
<i>because the class where you get</i>
<i>to see naked people,</i>

306
00:10:56,709 --> 00:10:59,375
<i>and draw them, was full.</i>

307
00:10:59,417 --> 00:11:00,709
And you lied to me.

308
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:03,208
You told me you bought
this property to live on.

309
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:06,625
No, you bought this property
to put up a wall.

310
00:11:06,667 --> 00:11:08,333
I told one lie,

311
00:11:08,375 --> 00:11:10,792
but I-I was going to share
the money with you.

312
00:11:10,834 --> 00:11:12,333
-Two lies.
-And why do I think

313
00:11:12,375 --> 00:11:15,208
that you charge more than
five dollars for lemonade?

314
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:17,250
Three small lies.

315
00:11:17,291 --> 00:11:19,667
Now, will you do me a favor,
just get in the tent.

316
00:11:19,709 --> 00:11:21,041
Gob's getting rid of the bees,

317
00:11:21,083 --> 00:11:22,667
and we'll push the matinee
till 3:00.

318
00:11:22,709 --> 00:11:24,875
No, I'm sick and tired
of being in that hut

319
00:11:24,917 --> 00:11:26,542
pretending to be you.

320
00:11:26,583 --> 00:11:30,041
Maybe I should go out there
and pretend to be you.

321
00:11:30,083 --> 00:11:31,542
So, good-bye, George.

322
00:11:31,583 --> 00:11:33,041
This is the last
you'll see of me.

323
00:11:33,083 --> 00:11:36,792
Just gonna use the can
for one second.

327
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:49,542

-Right.

LUCILLE:
<i>Yesterday, you were amazing.</i>

332
00:11:55,583 --> 00:11:57,875
Georgie, I can't stop
thinking about it.

333
00:11:57,917 --> 00:12:00,291
You haven't been
like that in years.

334

GEORGE SR.:
Oh, right.

335

for more of the same today.

337
00:12:06,542 --> 00:12:08,250
(growls playfully)

338
00:12:08,291 --> 00:12:10,417
Uh... (sighs) Oh, God.

339
00:12:10,458 --> 00:12:11,917
<i>George Sr. had a few problems:</i>

340
00:12:11,959 --> 00:12:13,792
<i>his brother was</i>
<i>sleeping with his wife,</i>

341
00:12:13,834 --> 00:12:15,417
<i>the property he was going to</i>
<i>sell to the government...</i>

342
00:12:15,458 --> 00:12:16,917
(Lucille whispering)

343
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:18,834
<i>to build the U.S. wall on</i>
<i>was in Mexico...</i>

344
00:12:18,875 --> 00:12:20,709
GEORGE SR.: All right...
all right...

345
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:22,834
<i>...and his sweat lodge colony</i>
<i>had just collapsed.</i>

346
00:12:22,875 --> 00:12:24,125
Okay.

347
00:12:24,166 --> 00:12:25,375
<i>So he had to deal with</i>
<i>first things first.</i>

348
00:12:25,417 --> 00:12:27,667
GEORGE SR.:
<i>If my identical twin brother</i>

349
00:12:27,709 --> 00:12:30,333
can get it up, then shouldn't I?

350
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:32,500
Have you had any sexual feeling
at all lately?

351
00:12:32,542 --> 00:12:33,959
No!

352
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,417
You know, the Hopi Indians
believe that this spot here,

353
00:12:36,458 --> 00:12:37,917
-Okay.
-when manipulated,

354
00:12:37,959 --> 00:12:40,375
-can create sexual feeling.
-That's my penis.

355
00:12:40,417 --> 00:12:42,625
Well, you don't have to tell me.
Nothing?

356
00:12:42,667 --> 00:12:44,417
No, just a little curiosity

357
00:12:44,458 --> 00:12:46,291
as to why you're checking
your second hand.

358
00:12:46,333 --> 00:12:48,417
Oh, this isn't my office.

359
00:12:48,458 --> 00:12:50,333
You know, I-I don't get it.

360
00:12:50,375 --> 00:12:52,709
I've been popping the pills,
and, I mean, I mean, nothing.

361
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:54,709
-Are you under any pressure?
-Oh, no.

362
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:56,041
Nothing out of the ordinary.

363
00:12:56,083 --> 00:12:58,250
I mean, there's some
violating federal law stuff

364
00:12:58,291 --> 00:13:00,542
that'd put me in prison
for the rest of my life,

365
00:13:00,583 --> 00:13:03,750
but I've made love with
treason charges over me before.

366
00:13:03,792 --> 00:13:04,917
But no, it's something else.

367
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:06,083
It's not just the sex.

368
00:13:06,125 --> 00:13:08,792
I feel...

369
00:13:08,834 --> 00:13:11,083
(sobbing):
I feel wrong.

370
00:13:11,125 --> 00:13:12,917
Somehow.

371
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:14,917
(sobbing)

372
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:17,834
And I'm becoming weak.

373
00:13:17,875 --> 00:13:19,000
(inhales)

374
00:13:19,041 --> 00:13:20,583
Sorry, had the old
thinking cap on.

375
00:13:20,625 --> 00:13:22,417
Let's go to the lists.

376
00:13:22,458 --> 00:13:24,000
NARRATOR:<i> And Dr. Norman</i>
<i>proceeded to run through</i>

377
00:13:24,041 --> 00:13:26,000
<i>a checklist of alternative</i>
<i>medicine questions.</i>

378
00:13:26,041 --> 00:13:27,625
Okay, did you drink some water
that might have

379
00:13:27,667 --> 00:13:29,083
a homeopathic memory
of some molecule?

380
00:13:29,125 --> 00:13:30,417
Do you keep track

381
00:13:30,458 --> 00:13:31,750
of the molecules you ingest?

382
00:13:31,792 --> 00:13:33,417
Well, with homeopathy,

383
00:13:33,458 --> 00:13:34,750
it's the molecules
you don't ingest.

384
00:13:34,792 --> 00:13:36,000
But I'm the one
who can get hard,

385
00:13:36,041 --> 00:13:37,750
so let's focus on you.

386
00:13:37,792 --> 00:13:39,959
<i>He then went on to explore</i>
<i>some supernatural</i>

387
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,583
<i>or high-concept</i>
<i>premise possibilities.</i>

388
00:13:41,625 --> 00:13:43,417
Any earthquakes
in a Chinese restaurant

389
00:13:43,458 --> 00:13:45,417
-while you were trying to prove
something to your mother? 
-No.

390
00:13:45,458 --> 00:13:46,709
Any wishes you may have
phrased badly,

391
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:48,458
or while a child
was blowing out a candle?

392
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:50,083
No.

393
00:13:50,125 --> 00:13:51,917
Have you come across
any ancient games, let's say,

394
00:13:51,959 --> 00:13:55,083
glowing games, uh, either
board based or carnival based,

395
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:57,709
that you may have played against
the wishes of your best friend?

396
00:13:57,750 --> 00:13:59,709
-No.
-Curses, hexes, spells,

397
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:03,583
shaman, medicine men?

398
00:14:03,625 --> 00:14:05,083
Wait.

399
00:14:05,125 --> 00:14:07,625
The strong will become the weak.

400
00:14:07,667 --> 00:14:10,458
The weak will become the strong.

401
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:14,417
I did hallucinate one ancient
foreboding warrior harbinger

402
00:14:14,458 --> 00:14:16,667
while I chewed maca root
about a year ago.

403
00:14:16,709 --> 00:14:18,583
Could that be something?

404
00:14:18,625 --> 00:14:20,417
-No, it's not the maca.
-(filtered breathing)

405
00:14:20,458 --> 00:14:21,583
Your body wants the maca.

406
00:14:21,625 --> 00:14:22,917
It's not the maca.

407
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:24,917
<i>But finally,</i>
<i>out of desperation,</i>

408
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:26,625
<i>he turned to Western medicine.</i>

409
00:14:26,667 --> 00:14:28,417
Okay, tell you what,
let's get some film on you.

410
00:14:28,458 --> 00:14:30,625
I'd like you to get
on an MRI machine

411
00:14:30,667 --> 00:14:32,125
and try to ride it to climax.

412
00:14:32,166 --> 00:14:33,750
I'm gonna send you over
to Orange County Imaging--

413
00:14:33,792 --> 00:14:35,583
they do a ton of that.

414
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:37,125
Okay, do I get magazines?

415
00:14:37,166 --> 00:14:39,125
Yeah, I'll write you
a script for that.

416
00:14:39,166 --> 00:14:41,750
They got a place right around
the corner that plays ball.

417
00:14:41,792 --> 00:14:42,959
-Thank you.
-(men shouting in Spanish)

418
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,458
Oh, (bleep). Run.

419
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:47,417
What? Oh.

420
00:14:47,458 --> 00:14:49,959
<i>And soon, after getting</i>
<i>his prescription filled...</i>

421
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:50,959
Uh...<i> hola...</i>

422
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,458
I have a, um-- magazines?

423
00:14:56,125 --> 00:14:57,625
(men conversing quietly)

424
00:14:57,667 --> 00:14:59,083
<i>...he was on his way</i>

425
00:14:59,125 --> 00:15:01,625
<i>to debase himself</i>
<i>in an MRI machine</i>

426
00:15:01,667 --> 00:15:05,125
<i>when he ran into a son</i>
<i>with whom he'd lost touch.</i>

427
00:15:08,583 --> 00:15:10,417
Dad, what are you doing here?

428
00:15:10,458 --> 00:15:14,500
I wanted to speak to you...
in person.

429
00:15:14,542 --> 00:15:15,917
Then you're here to apologize;
that right?

430
00:15:15,959 --> 00:15:17,709
-Sure. 
<i>-Although,</i>
<i>he covered pretty well.</i>

431
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:21,583
And-and of course to see you
at Orange County Im-a-gine.

432
00:15:21,625 --> 00:15:24,667
I went to you
for a simple signature,

433
00:15:24,709 --> 00:15:26,917
and you told me to go to hell.

434
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:29,583
<i>Actually, it was</i>
<i>the newly potent Oscar,</i>

435
00:15:29,625 --> 00:15:31,834
<i>who, like one of</i>
<i>Gob's sick bees,</i>

436
00:15:31,875 --> 00:15:34,792
<i>was pollinating one barren</i>
<i>flower after another,</i>

437
00:15:34,834 --> 00:15:35,875
<i>who told Michael to go to hell.</i>

438
00:15:35,917 --> 00:15:37,750
-Go to hell.
-Huh?

439
00:15:37,792 --> 00:15:39,917
<i>Which is how George Sr.</i>

440
00:15:39,959 --> 00:15:41,959
<i>not only was left with </i>
Senor Senoritas,

441
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,417
<i>and that's when he got a lead</i>
<i>on his wall problem.</i>

442
00:15:44,458 --> 00:15:45,917
Do you know a guy
named Herbert Love?

443
00:15:45,959 --> 00:15:47,583
I know a lot of people, sure.

444
00:15:47,625 --> 00:15:49,875
<i>And soon, he surprised Michael</i>

445
00:15:49,917 --> 00:15:51,959
<i>by giving him his rights</i>
<i>for the movie project.</i>

446
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,500
I didn't know it was about
lying to a girl.

447
00:15:56,542 --> 00:15:59,125
-Give me the release.
-You'd do this for me?

448
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:01,917
-Of course I will.
-And then, didn't surprise him.

449
00:16:01,959 --> 00:16:04,542
If you'll do something for me.

450
00:16:04,583 --> 00:16:05,959
I knew it.

451
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,417
Michael, you got to get
this Love guy against the wall

452
00:16:09,458 --> 00:16:10,667
between the U.S. and Mexico.

453
00:16:10,709 --> 00:16:12,083
That's not right.

454
00:16:12,125 --> 00:16:13,500
You're really opposed
to this wall, huh?

455
00:16:13,542 --> 00:16:14,542
When did you
become pro-immigrant?

456
00:16:14,583 --> 00:16:16,625
I have changed, Michael.

457
00:16:16,667 --> 00:16:18,750
I cry (clears throat)

458
00:16:18,792 --> 00:16:21,458
<i>at the drop of a hat,</i>
<i>and I hate the way I look.</i>

459
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:24,458
<i>I actually had one cute hat,</i>
<i>and it...</i>

460
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:29,333
<i>it blew off</i>
<i>at the CVS parking lot.</i>

461
00:16:29,375 --> 00:16:32,250
<i>(sobbing): And this whole car</i>
<i>full of black kids ran over it,</i>

462
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:33,333
for no reason.

463
00:16:33,375 --> 00:16:36,125
And they saw it!

464
00:16:36,166 --> 00:16:38,000
They saw it!

465
00:16:38,041 --> 00:16:39,834
Michael...

466
00:16:39,875 --> 00:16:41,834
(pats bench)

467
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:45,125
Anyway, I live down there now.

468
00:16:45,166 --> 00:16:47,500
And I care for these people
who just want

469
00:16:47,542 --> 00:16:50,750
to come into this country
and ply their wares

470
00:16:50,792 --> 00:16:53,458
and let us freely fill the bay
with their culture.

471
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:55,458
Hey, don't get me started
on the Cinco, Dad.

472
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:57,250
I haven't been to one
in 20 years.

473
00:16:57,291 --> 00:16:59,083
There's gonna be blowback there;
it's just gonna happen.

474
00:16:59,125 --> 00:17:01,125
You can't swim in that bay
for a month after

475
00:17:01,166 --> 00:17:03,000
without getting
nacho cheese sauce in your hair.

476
00:17:03,041 --> 00:17:04,250
It's coming.

477
00:17:04,291 --> 00:17:06,458
Can you help me, then,
with Love?

478
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:08,375
At his speech, at Cinco?

479
00:17:08,417 --> 00:17:10,375
Can you do that for your dad?

480
00:17:10,417 --> 00:17:13,417
<i>What he didn't tell Michael was</i>
<i>that the family would go broke</i>

481
00:17:13,458 --> 00:17:15,458
<i>if they had to build the wall.</i>

482
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:17,458
Of course I will.

483
00:17:19,458 --> 00:17:21,625
<i>Maybe, if he had,</i>
<i>Michael wouldn't have</i>

484
00:17:21,667 --> 00:17:23,917
<i>overplayed his hand</i>
<i>as a big-shot producer</i>

485
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:25,917
<i>who knew lots of people.</i>

486
00:17:25,959 --> 00:17:27,542
<i>But a deal was soon struck...</i>

487
00:17:27,583 --> 00:17:28,959
-Thanks, Pop.
-All right.

488
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,917
<i>...and Michael,</i>
<i>signed contract in hand,</i>

489
00:17:30,959 --> 00:17:33,041
<i>went to show off</i>
<i>at the Ealing Club,</i>

490
00:17:33,083 --> 00:17:35,583
<i>while George Sr.,</i>
<i>magazine in hand,</i>

491
00:17:35,625 --> 00:17:38,125
<i>went to (bleep) off</i>
<i>in an MRI machine.</i>

492
00:17:45,041 --> 00:17:48,166
NARRATOR:<i> George Sr. finally</i>
<i>went to visit a wife</i>

493
00:17:48,208 --> 00:17:51,041
<i>who was under the impression</i>
<i>that he was back for more.</i>

494
00:17:51,083 --> 00:17:52,750
The wrong land?

495
00:17:52,792 --> 00:17:54,375
It's under control;
I'm trying to get Love

496
00:17:54,417 --> 00:17:56,208
to come out against the wall.

497
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:58,417
We can't afford to build it
if we're not

498
00:17:58,458 --> 00:18:00,417
selling the land
back to the government.

499
00:18:00,458 --> 00:18:02,166
It'll ruin us.

500
00:18:02,208 --> 00:18:04,291
It'll ruin us
if we don't build it.

501
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:07,083
George, you've gone puny again.

502
00:18:07,125 --> 00:18:09,375
Where's the man who took
ahold of me yesterday

503
00:18:09,417 --> 00:18:11,041
and bent me over this couch?

504
00:18:11,083 --> 00:18:13,792
Okay, okay,
let's not sully its memory.

505
00:18:13,834 --> 00:18:17,959
Look, we make sure Herbert Love
comes out against the wall,

506
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,041
right after we get
enough of it up

507
00:18:20,083 --> 00:18:21,917
to trigger
the government payment.

508
00:18:21,959 --> 00:18:24,750
And speaking of
getting enough of it up,

509
00:18:24,792 --> 00:18:26,333
what's going on down here?

510
00:18:26,375 --> 00:18:29,959
You need a little more Marilyn
like I did yesterday?

511
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,041
<i>♪ Happy birthday,</i>
<i>Mr. President... ♪</i>

512
00:18:33,083 --> 00:18:34,417
I-I don't want to be
Mr. President.

513
00:18:34,458 --> 00:18:37,291
Huh. Especially with
all this going down.

514
00:18:37,333 --> 00:18:40,417
Oh, and speaking of president,
what's happening with Gob?

515
00:18:40,458 --> 00:18:41,875
You gave him a job?

516
00:18:41,917 --> 00:18:43,458
Yes, but then I-I fired him.

517
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:45,458
He caused my colony to collapse.

518
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:48,208
Oh, my God, George,
get him another job.

519
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:51,750
You must have some favors
you can call in somewhere.

520
00:18:51,792 --> 00:18:55,875
And then you can have some of
my favors, Mr. President.

521
00:18:55,917 --> 00:18:57,458
As much as I'd like to stay

522
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:59,125
and lay some more pipe with you,

523
00:18:59,166 --> 00:19:01,000
I better get moving
on this thing.

524
00:19:01,041 --> 00:19:02,291
<i>And so, the next day,</i>

525
00:19:02,333 --> 00:19:04,709
<i>George Sr. once again</i>
<i>called upon his son.</i>

526
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:05,917
Michael B. Project.

527
00:19:05,959 --> 00:19:07,834
GEORGE SR.:
<i>Yeah, you got to give Gob a job.</i>

528
00:19:07,875 --> 00:19:09,500
Something in
the, uh, building company

529
00:19:09,542 --> 00:19:12,417
or, uh, hey, I think
he'd get a big kick

530
00:19:12,458 --> 00:19:13,667
<i>out of the movie business.</i>

531
00:19:13,709 --> 00:19:14,875
N-N-No, Dad, hey.

532
00:19:14,917 --> 00:19:16,792
He knows nothing
about producing.

533
00:19:16,834 --> 00:19:18,875
GEORGE SR.:<i> Look, I don't care</i>
<i>if it's producing a movie</i>

534
00:19:18,917 --> 00:19:20,458
<i>that's never gonna be made</i>

535
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:22,667
or selling houses
that no one's gonna buy,

536
00:19:22,709 --> 00:19:25,083
I just want my son
to have a job

537
00:19:25,125 --> 00:19:27,959
where his incompetence
won't be out of place.

538
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,125
<i>Anyway, he's on his way</i>
<i>to Sudden Valley now.</i>

539
00:19:30,166 --> 00:19:32,000
No, he isn't.
No, no, come on, Dad...

540
00:19:32,041 --> 00:19:33,625
-No, no, now?
-GEORGE SR.:<i> What, what?</i>

541
00:19:33,667 --> 00:19:35,000
He's gonna make it
less valuable?

542
00:19:35,041 --> 00:19:37,333
Which I told you
was gonna happen, by the way.

543
00:19:37,375 --> 00:19:38,542
MICHAEL:<i> Oh, here it is.</i>
<i>Here it is.</i>

544
00:19:38,583 --> 00:19:40,125
<i>Yeah, there it is!</i>
<i>Knew it was coming.</i>

545
00:19:40,166 --> 00:19:42,417
NARRATOR:<i> And even though George</i>
<i>had imposed on Michael,</i>

546
00:19:42,458 --> 00:19:44,041
<i>it was Gob...</i>

547
00:19:44,083 --> 00:19:45,875
GOB:
What the hell?

548
00:19:45,917 --> 00:19:47,917
<i>...who felt</i>
<i>he had a cross to bear.</i>

549
00:19:47,959 --> 00:19:50,750
MICHAEL:
What the hell?

550
00:19:50,792 --> 00:19:52,333
(tires screeching,
horns honking)

551
00:19:52,375 --> 00:19:54,000
MICHAEL: Hey, hey, hey, hey,
hey, I got the right of--

552
00:19:54,041 --> 00:19:55,750
-Hey, hey, hey...
-N-No, don't. It's mine.

553
00:19:55,792 --> 00:19:57,709
-Okay, coming through here.
-Mine... Hah!

554
00:19:57,750 --> 00:20:00,208
No... no, no!
My right of... way!

555
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:01,834
-There! Mine!
-Okay. (weak laugh)

556
00:20:01,875 --> 00:20:02,959
Hey...

557
00:20:07,792 --> 00:20:08,834
Gob!

558
00:20:08,875 --> 00:20:10,208
(chuckles):
Michael!

559
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:11,208
<i>And the two brothers</i>
<i>reunited...</i>

560
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:12,208
Hey, Gob.

561
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:13,208
Michael.

562
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:15,208
<i>...happy to see each other.</i>

563
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:16,417
Gob?

564
00:20:16,458 --> 00:20:18,125
<i>At first.</i>

565
00:20:18,166 --> 00:20:20,709
Michael.

566
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:22,709
So, hear you need help moving

567
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:25,709
these memorials to the death
of the housing market.

568
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:28,208
(mailbox plays tune,
then stops)

569
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:29,875
Actually that was a memorial

570
00:20:29,917 --> 00:20:32,250
-to the death of Pete
the mailman. 
-I knew that.

571
00:20:32,291 --> 00:20:35,750
I brought one, too--
size of the man's heart.

572
00:20:35,792 --> 00:20:38,417
I just got to figure out
how to get it out of the car.

573
00:20:38,458 --> 00:20:40,917
If I could remember
how I got it in.

574
00:20:40,959 --> 00:20:42,834
That's not
from your Christian magic act?

575
00:20:42,875 --> 00:20:44,208
Christian magic act?

576
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:47,041
If I were Muslim, would you say
"Muslim magic act"?

577
00:20:47,083 --> 00:20:51,083
No, but it is hard to imagine
any Muslim handcuffing himself

578
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:54,041
to a glittery cross
and living to tell about it.

579
00:20:54,083 --> 00:20:56,208
Yeah, well, the Christians
aren't so (bleep)-hot

580
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:58,083
about it either.

581
00:20:58,125 --> 00:21:00,458
Hmm, well...

582
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:03,208
NARRATOR:<i> Michael could see</i>
<i>that his brother was unhappy</i>

583
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:04,959
<i>and that his life had not</i>
<i>worked out</i>

584
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,959
<i>the way he had hoped.</i>

585
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,875
Things are incredible for me,
I'm having an incredible year.

586
00:21:10,917 --> 00:21:13,333
I am a movie producer now,
producing a movie,

587
00:21:13,375 --> 00:21:14,959
so they've got me
in this enormous office.

588
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,250
I told 'em
I don't want to be driving

589
00:21:16,291 --> 00:21:18,000
to Beverly Hills
every single day,

590
00:21:18,041 --> 00:21:21,083
so they put me in an enormous
office just over here.

591
00:21:23,959 --> 00:21:25,333
Rental.

592
00:21:25,375 --> 00:21:28,417
My personal life is off
the charts. I've met someone.

593
00:21:28,458 --> 00:21:31,291
Can't really give you any
information-- kind of famousy.

594
00:21:31,333 --> 00:21:33,041
-Well, good for you.
I also met someone.
-Have you?

595
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:35,709
Also famousy.
Can't give<i> you</i> any information.

596
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:38,041
<i>In fact, Michael didn't even</i>
<i>find out who she was</i>

597
00:21:38,083 --> 00:21:40,291
<i>until one night, earlier.</i>

598
00:21:40,333 --> 00:21:42,750
Oh, my God. I'm dating Ron
Howard's girlfriend.

599
00:21:42,792 --> 00:21:45,291
<i>Although he did have</i>
<i>some of the details wrong.</i>

600
00:21:45,333 --> 00:21:47,375
She's an actress.
You know her.

601
00:21:47,417 --> 00:21:50,709
<i>She was Ron's</i>
<i>illegitimate daughter,</i>

602
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:52,083
<i>a fact unbeknownst to many.</i>

603
00:21:52,125 --> 00:21:53,875
Well, we kind of like to keep
that quiet.

604
00:21:53,917 --> 00:21:58,041
<i>A woman who, like Bryce Dallas</i>
<i>and Paige Carlyle,</i>

605
00:21:58,083 --> 00:22:01,166
<i>was named after</i>
<i>where she was conceived.</i>

606
00:22:01,208 --> 00:22:05,000
<i>And she actually had worked</i>
<i>for some A-list directors.</i>

607
00:22:05,041 --> 00:22:06,375
<i>She did a Terrence Malick...</i>

608
00:22:06,417 --> 00:22:08,875
REBEL:
<i>Are we the same?</i>

609
00:22:08,917 --> 00:22:10,208
<i>She got the lead</i>
<i>in a Woody Allen film...</i>

610
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:12,041
But I felt like I was in
<i>The Iceman Cometh,</i>

611
00:22:12,083 --> 00:22:14,458
but, you know,
in my case, he faketh.

612
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:16,709
<i>...and was once even directed</i>
<i>by her own father.</i>

613
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:17,875
Action!

614
00:22:17,917 --> 00:22:19,792
Next time, don't pocket it,

615
00:22:19,834 --> 00:22:20,834
pay for it.

616
00:22:20,875 --> 00:22:23,166
Shoplifting: not cool.

617
00:22:23,208 --> 00:22:26,208
<i>-...in a public service</i>
<i>announcement. </i>
-And cut!

618
00:22:26,250 --> 00:22:27,208
<i>Which, like all of</i>
<i>Ron's work...</i>

619
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:28,375
You know, I think we got it.

620
00:22:28,417 --> 00:22:30,417
<i>...was inspired</i>
<i>by a photograph.</i>

621
00:22:30,458 --> 00:22:32,375
<i>Rebel was indeed a rebel.</i>

622
00:22:32,417 --> 00:22:35,291
<i>But Michael didn't possess</i>
<i>that information.</i>

623
00:22:35,333 --> 00:22:37,333
I<i> can</i> give you some information
about your airless office

624
00:22:37,375 --> 00:22:38,959
you're gonna be spending
most mornings in.

625
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,375
You know, what I could go for
is some guac.

626
00:22:40,417 --> 00:22:41,959
Well, you don't live there
anymore, Gob.

627
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,166
This heat just makes,
makes me want guac.

628
00:22:44,208 --> 00:22:46,166
Now, now, I know
I've got these things,

629
00:22:46,208 --> 00:22:48,875
uh, very, you know,
meticulously maintained.

630
00:22:48,917 --> 00:22:51,125
-(squawk)
-There's...

631
00:22:51,166 --> 00:22:52,375
There are some vultures.

632
00:22:52,417 --> 00:22:54,709
I think they might
still smell Pete.

633
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:56,709
Yeah, if it wasn't for the movie
thing, I would do it myself.

634
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:58,250
They practically sell
themselves; you just got

635
00:22:58,291 --> 00:23:00,250
-to bring the people in.
-I'm ready to move in today.

636
00:23:00,291 --> 00:23:02,250
No, well, people other than you,

637
00:23:02,291 --> 00:23:03,959
-bring those people in.
-I'm starving.

638
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,166
Starving? No, you're not
gonna find anything here.

639
00:23:05,208 --> 00:23:06,208
They've been abandoned for...

640
00:23:08,792 --> 00:23:11,125
Lindsay.

641
00:23:11,166 --> 00:23:14,083
No, no, this-- maybe Tobias.

642
00:23:14,125 --> 00:23:15,208
NARRATOR:
<i>It was John Beard.</i>

643
00:23:15,250 --> 00:23:16,959
Shall we?

644
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,709
Well, the value of these homes
isn't gonna go down

645
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:19,875
if we don't sell one today.

646
00:23:19,917 --> 00:23:22,417
Let me see
if I can find a, uh...

647
00:23:22,458 --> 00:23:23,917
Do you have a bottle opener?

648
00:23:23,959 --> 00:23:25,959
Great idea.

649
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,208
<i>And after a few more drinks and</i>
<i>a little more depreciation...</i>

650
00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:30,208
-That was surprising.
<i>-...Michael admitted he had</i>

651
00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:31,792
<i>a rival for his girlfriend.</i>

652
00:23:31,834 --> 00:23:34,375
You don't have to worry
about Ron Howard.

653
00:23:34,417 --> 00:23:36,250
I mean, he's not
competition for you.

654
00:23:36,291 --> 00:23:37,792
-Really?
-Yeah, I mean, the guy's

655
00:23:37,834 --> 00:23:39,333
like 100 years old.
What's he gonna do,

656
00:23:39,375 --> 00:23:40,875
poke you in the eyes?

657
00:23:40,917 --> 00:23:41,959
Oh, you're confused.

658
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,041
Ron Howard directed<i> Apollo 13.</i>

659
00:23:43,083 --> 00:23:44,875
You're thinking of Moe Howard,

660
00:23:44,917 --> 00:23:46,959
the angry stooge who's been dead
for a quarter century.

661
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,750
Well, that's good 'cause the
whole time I'm thinking, like,

662
00:23:48,792 --> 00:23:50,000
"unless she likes
a guy who's funny."

663
00:23:50,041 --> 00:23:51,834
-Sure.
-Because that guy is funny.

664
00:23:51,875 --> 00:23:53,208
-'Cause the whole time
you're like... 
-You know...

665
00:23:53,250 --> 00:23:55,041
-"Is he gonna poke me
in the eyes?" 
-Gob,

666
00:23:55,083 --> 00:23:57,709
I don't think that th-the
movie-- it might not even happen

667
00:23:57,750 --> 00:23:59,458
because I don't think
that I can ask my son.

668
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:02,250
What happened between him and me
was very disappointing.

669
00:24:02,291 --> 00:24:04,250
You don't need to tell me
about disappointment and sons.

670
00:24:04,291 --> 00:24:07,250
Let's not forget Steve Holt.

671
00:24:07,291 --> 00:24:09,750
That's the story
of our relationship.

672
00:24:09,792 --> 00:24:11,917
Right, well, I was talking about
a son disappointing a father.

673
00:24:11,959 --> 00:24:13,417
Yeah, that does make it
different.

674
00:24:13,458 --> 00:24:16,000
Look, Michael,
he doesn't respect you,

675
00:24:16,041 --> 00:24:17,208
so you have
to make him respect you.

676
00:24:17,250 --> 00:24:18,959
Show him that you're a big shot,

677
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,959
that you don't need to
live in your son's dorm.

678
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,166
(sighs) No, I just live
in my parents' penthouse now.

679
00:24:23,208 --> 00:24:24,959
Well, then, take him to the
Ealing Club; it's all showbiz.

680
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,375
I used to hang out there
all the time.

681
00:24:26,417 --> 00:24:28,375
It's just actresses
and stuff like that.

682
00:24:28,417 --> 00:24:30,041
I don't know
if I could pick up the phone

683
00:24:30,083 --> 00:24:31,917
and call him and ask him.

684
00:24:31,959 --> 00:24:33,250
-You know what, Michael?
-Hmm?

685
00:24:33,291 --> 00:24:35,041
I'll call him for you.

686
00:24:36,250 --> 00:24:38,208
Really, you'd do that for me?

687
00:24:38,250 --> 00:24:39,834
It's the least I could do.

688
00:24:39,875 --> 00:24:41,917
You've given me
a new sense of purpose.

689
00:24:41,959 --> 00:24:44,875
Did you actually have
an old one?

690
00:24:44,917 --> 00:24:46,750
'Cause it always seemed
like you were just looking

691
00:24:46,792 --> 00:24:48,083
for the easy way out.

692
00:24:48,125 --> 00:24:50,792
Yeah, that was it.

693
00:24:50,834 --> 00:24:54,583
Hi, I'm George Bluth
of the Bluth Company, and, uh...

694
00:24:54,625 --> 00:24:56,458
NARRATOR:<i> George Sr.,</i>
<i>meanwhile, was also finding</i>

695
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:57,458
<i>an easy way out</i>
<i>of the wall problem.</i>

696
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:58,542
...we've built this wall.

697
00:24:58,583 --> 00:25:03,000
We have miles and,
and miles of wall.

698
00:25:03,041 --> 00:25:05,500
Will you confirm that, soldier?

699
00:25:05,542 --> 00:25:06,583
(soldier grunts, gags)

700
00:25:06,625 --> 00:25:08,750
It's ab-about protecting
our border,

701
00:25:08,792 --> 00:25:10,750
which is why, uh,
we have a member

702
00:25:10,792 --> 00:25:14,000
of our armed forces
with us today.

703
00:25:14,041 --> 00:25:15,625
-(coughing)
-Say hello.

704
00:25:15,667 --> 00:25:16,917
(Buster grunts)

705
00:25:16,959 --> 00:25:19,625
It's, uh, triple-reinforced,
steel-reinforced,

706
00:25:19,667 --> 00:25:22,625
and I don't really
know how to, how to say

707
00:25:22,667 --> 00:25:25,750
that, uh, what it does is,
it protects, um...

708
00:25:25,792 --> 00:25:27,542
It's Mexican-proof.

709
00:25:27,583 --> 00:25:29,250
(laughing):
So-- can't say-- it...

710
00:25:29,291 --> 00:25:30,917
Well, gosh darn it,

711
00:25:30,959 --> 00:25:32,834
it<i> is</i> Mexican-proof.

712
00:25:32,875 --> 00:25:33,917
(gags, snorts)

713
00:25:33,959 --> 00:25:35,417
Sit up.

714
00:25:35,458 --> 00:25:36,542
-Uh...
-Daddy, my tummy's turning.

715
00:25:36,583 --> 00:25:37,959
All right.

716
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,458
-Uh, it's, uh triple-reinforced.
-I got...

717
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:40,875
Daddy, I got to get out,

718
00:25:40,917 --> 00:25:42,375
-I got to get out.
-Uh, we're gonna be...

719
00:25:42,417 --> 00:25:43,667
Oh, for God's sakes, get out.

720
00:25:43,709 --> 00:25:45,291
I need to get out,
I need to get out.

721
00:25:45,333 --> 00:25:46,709
-Oh, for... 
-I need to get out,
I need to get out.

722
00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:49,583
We're not gonna... we'll edit
this part out and, uh...

723
00:25:49,625 --> 00:25:51,125
Anyhow...

724
00:25:51,166 --> 00:25:54,000
NARRATOR:<i> But George Sr.</i>
<i>hadn't built miles of wall.</i>

725
00:25:54,041 --> 00:25:57,750

726
00:25:57,792 --> 00:26:00,709

<i>George arrived,</i>

728

No, thanks. I've already crushed
one with my car.

<i>...sway public opinion</i>
<i>against the wall</i>

730

731
00:26:08,875 --> 00:26:10,000
<i>-to build it for real. </i>
-Pop, hey, hi.

732
00:26:10,041 --> 00:26:11,917
-Michael, what happened?
-Yeah.

733
00:26:11,959 --> 00:26:13,959
Oh, the-- it's a terrible week,

734
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,333
but I'm gonna fix things
once and for all right now.

735
00:26:16,375 --> 00:26:18,000
-Is this about Love?
-No, it's about money,

736
00:26:18,041 --> 00:26:22,917
but I-I'm-- I will pay her back,
uh, one way or the other.

737
00:26:22,959 --> 00:26:24,000
Who?

738
00:26:24,041 --> 00:26:25,333
Lucille 2-- I'm gonna get her

739
00:26:25,375 --> 00:26:27,083
-against the wall.
-No, no, no, no, no,

740
00:26:27,125 --> 00:26:29,083
she cannot know about this wall.

741
00:26:29,125 --> 00:26:31,375
Fine, I'll get her up against
the top of the staircar.

742
00:26:31,417 --> 00:26:33,166
I don't care,
it's gonna happen, though.

743
00:26:33,208 --> 00:26:34,959
I am talking about Herbert Love.

744
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,834
-Is he going to oppose the
building of the wall? 
-Oh, yes.

745
00:26:37,875 --> 00:26:39,208
I took care of that.

746
00:26:39,250 --> 00:26:41,333
He is going to announce that
in his speech tonight.

747
00:26:41,375 --> 00:26:42,333
That is great news.

748
00:26:42,375 --> 00:26:44,166
Listen, I-I-I have to go.

749
00:26:44,208 --> 00:26:47,166
I have to see if I can pass
this testosterone test.

750
00:26:47,208 --> 00:26:49,458
I do, too.
(chuckles)

751
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:51,208
And, listen, not a word to...

752
00:26:51,250 --> 00:26:52,750
How dare you?

753
00:26:52,792 --> 00:26:56,000
Lucille 2.

754
00:26:56,041 --> 00:26:58,291
Did you think
I wouldn't find out?

755
00:26:58,333 --> 00:26:59,709
I was going to cut you in.

756
00:26:59,750 --> 00:27:00,875
I was trying to protect you

757
00:27:00,917 --> 00:27:02,959
so they wouldn't link you to it,

758
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,583
but it turns out that we can't
afford to build it anyway.

759
00:27:05,625 --> 00:27:09,333
-Build what? 
-The wall in Mexico, 
the, the high wall.

760
00:27:09,375 --> 00:27:11,542
-What were, what were you
talking about? 
-I was talking

761
00:27:11,583 --> 00:27:14,917
about you giving money
to Herbert Love in his campaign

762
00:27:14,959 --> 00:27:17,208
-against me.
-Oh, no, no,

763
00:27:17,250 --> 00:27:19,333
that was to get Love
to support the wall.

764
00:27:19,375 --> 00:27:21,625
Oh, I tell you, I've been
all over the place on this one.

765
00:27:21,667 --> 00:27:24,333
I can't be running a company
that's building a wall

766
00:27:24,375 --> 00:27:25,625
I campaigned against!

767
00:27:25,667 --> 00:27:28,208
Listen to me,
it's taken care of.

768
00:27:28,250 --> 00:27:29,333
I just ran into Michael.

769
00:27:29,375 --> 00:27:32,417
He's got Love against the wall.

770
00:27:32,458 --> 00:27:34,458
It's done, it's gonna be in
the speech tonight, it's over.

771
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:36,208
It better be,

772
00:27:36,250 --> 00:27:38,875
or I'll talk about it
in<i> my</i> speech tonight.

773
00:27:38,917 --> 00:27:41,500
Now, I've got a staircar
to wave from.

774
00:27:41,542 --> 00:27:42,834
And I can't be seen with you.

775
00:27:42,875 --> 00:27:44,375
'Cause I'm fat.

776
00:27:44,417 --> 00:27:46,375
It's because I am fat.

777
00:27:46,417 --> 00:27:48,375
You think I'm a fat person.

778
00:27:48,417 --> 00:27:50,709
You are such a drama queen.

779
00:27:50,750 --> 00:27:51,834
NARRATOR:
<i>George Sr. was worried.</i>

780
00:27:51,875 --> 00:27:53,500
These fat arms.

781
00:27:53,542 --> 00:27:55,208
I don't understand this.

782
00:27:55,250 --> 00:27:57,875
<i>And so, it was in</i>
<i>a state of agitation</i>

783
00:27:57,917 --> 00:28:00,458
<i>that George Sr. arrived</i>
<i>for his doctor's appointment.</i>

784
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:01,709
Excuse me, Dr. Norman?

785
00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:03,667
-You're mistaken.
-Dr. Norman,

786
00:28:03,709 --> 00:28:05,709
it's me, George Bluth.

787
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:09,667
Oh, George, yes,
thank you for meeting me here.

788
00:28:09,709 --> 00:28:13,709
I like to do a little
housecleaning on the fourth.

789
00:28:13,750 --> 00:28:15,333
(indistinct radio transmission)

790
00:28:15,375 --> 00:28:16,917
Old quinceañera candles.

791
00:28:16,959 --> 00:28:20,917
I was wondering if you could
tell me my test results.

792
00:28:20,959 --> 00:28:22,542
Oh, yes, yes, uh, well,

793
00:28:22,583 --> 00:28:24,333
your testosterone numbers
are off the charts.

794
00:28:24,375 --> 00:28:25,417
(sighs)

795
00:28:25,458 --> 00:28:27,291
Below the charts,
under the charts.

796
00:28:27,333 --> 00:28:28,709
I don't know how to say that.

797
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:30,542
You have almost
no testosterone at all.

798
00:28:30,583 --> 00:28:32,458
I don't know the exact numbers,
but it's somewhere

799
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:33,917
in the baby range.

800
00:28:33,959 --> 00:28:36,417
On the plus side,
your estrogen levels are that

801
00:28:36,458 --> 00:28:39,291
of a very healthy woman
in the throes of her menses.

802
00:28:39,333 --> 00:28:41,250
May I see my results?

803
00:28:41,291 --> 00:28:42,875
Ah, I wish you'd asked me
about five minutes ago.

804
00:28:42,917 --> 00:28:44,291
I think I dumped it
with a pot pipe

805
00:28:44,333 --> 00:28:45,500
and a bottle
of cheetah sedative.

806
00:28:45,542 --> 00:28:47,500
Also, the people
at Orange County Imaging

807
00:28:47,542 --> 00:28:50,667
said that you were masturbating
in an MRI tube?

808
00:28:51,709 --> 00:28:52,959
-Oh, no.
-But, Doctor,

809
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,291
you, you told me to.

810
00:28:54,333 --> 00:28:55,375
I did no such thing.

811
00:28:55,417 --> 00:28:56,417
Oh, no.

812
00:28:56,458 --> 00:28:59,458
No, no, you can't do that.

813
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:00,959
That sounds like something
I would say

814
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,542
when I had my thinking cap on.

815
00:29:02,583 --> 00:29:03,834

816

You, sir, are a very funny lady.

817
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:12,583

to the unattractive one.

Oh, this is
a little embarrassing.

841
00:30:09,750 --> 00:30:11,834
But I have been meaning
to get down there,

842
00:30:11,875 --> 00:30:13,709
-so let's just...
-You're right,

843
00:30:13,750 --> 00:30:16,667
I mean, it's not like we're
even technically related.

844
00:30:16,709 --> 00:30:20,542
-That's true. 
-Okay, well, then,
I'll start with a smear.

845
00:30:22,834 --> 00:30:24,667
NARRATOR:<i> And George Sr. gets</i>
more comfortable in hiding.

846
00:30:24,709 --> 00:30:26,208
GEORGE SR.:
Yes?

847
00:30:26,250 --> 00:30:27,875
Uh, Detective Smee,
Orange County Police.

848
00:30:27,917 --> 00:30:29,041
I need to speak with you.

849
00:30:29,083 --> 00:30:32,625
Lucille Austero went missing
last night.

850
00:30:32,667 --> 00:30:34,625
-You mind if we ask you
a few questions? 
-Oh...!

851
00:30:34,667 --> 00:30:36,458
I-I don't allow men
in my apartment

852
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:38,917
without my husband present.
