1
00:00:04,545 --> 00:00:06,589
male narrator: 
THIS IS MICHAEL BLUTH.

2
00:00:06,589 --> 00:00:09,092
FOR 10 YEARS, HE'S WORKED 
FOR HIS FATHER'S COMPANY,

3
00:00:09,092 --> 00:00:10,885
WAITING TO BE MADE A PARTNER.

4
00:00:10,885 --> 00:00:14,139
AND RIGHT NOW, HE'S HAPPY.

5
00:00:14,139 --> 00:00:15,348
THIS IS MICHAEL'S MOTHER.

6
00:00:15,348 --> 00:00:16,724
- LOOK WHAT THEY'VE DONE, 
MICHAEL.

7
00:00:16,724 --> 00:00:18,393
narrator: 
SHE ISN'T HAPPY.

8
00:00:18,393 --> 00:00:21,312
- LOOK WHAT THE HOMOSEXUALS 
HAVE DONE TO ME.

9
00:00:21,312 --> 00:00:23,939
- YOU CAN'T JUST COMB THAT OUT 
AND RESET IT?

10
00:00:23,939 --> 00:00:25,816
narrator: 
CURRENTLY, SHE'S UPSET

11
00:00:25,816 --> 00:00:27,110
THAT HER HUSBAND'S 
RETIREMENT PARTY

12
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:30,196
IS BEING UPSTAGED BY A GROUP 
OF GAY PROTESTERS.

13
00:00:30,196 --> 00:00:31,322
[together] 
WE'RE HERE. WE'RE QUEER.

14
00:00:31,322 --> 00:00:33,324
WE WANT TO GET MARRIED 
ON THE OCEAN.

15
00:00:33,324 --> 00:00:36,619
- EVERYTHING THEY DO 
IS SO DRAMATIC AND FLAMBOYANT.

16
00:00:36,619 --> 00:00:40,248
IT JUST MAKES ME 
WANT TO SET MYSELF ON FIRE.

17
00:00:40,248 --> 00:00:42,917
- [sighs] 
GOOD GRIEF, MOTHER.

18
00:00:42,917 --> 00:00:45,420
NOT ALL HOMOSEXUALS 
ARE FLAMBOY--

19
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:46,504
OH, MY GOD.

20
00:00:46,504 --> 00:00:47,880
I HAVE THE EXACT SAME BLOUSE.

21
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:50,841
narrator: THIS IS MICHAEL'S 
TWIN SISTER, LINDSAY.

22
00:00:50,841 --> 00:00:52,593
- I LIKE IT BETTER ON HIM.

23
00:00:52,593 --> 00:00:54,387
narrator: AS A YOUTHFUL ACT 
OF DEFIANCE,

24
00:00:54,387 --> 00:00:57,473
LINDSAY MARRIED THIS MAN.

25
00:00:57,473 --> 00:00:59,934
THEY MOVED TO BOSTON, 
WHERE THEY'VE BECOME CELEBRATED

26
00:00:59,934 --> 00:01:01,936
FOR THEIR WINE AND CHEESE 
FUND-RAISERS.

27
00:01:01,936 --> 00:01:04,105
- OH, NO. 
I'M COMPLETELY STUFFED.

28
00:01:04,105 --> 00:01:06,691
narrator: MICHAEL AND HIS SISTER 
HAVEN'T SPOKEN IN A YEAR.

29
00:01:06,691 --> 00:01:08,818
NEITHER HAS ACKNOWLEDGED THIS.

30
00:01:08,818 --> 00:01:11,987
AND THIS IS GOB, 
MICHAEL'S OLDEST BROTHER.

31
00:01:11,987 --> 00:01:15,075
- SO THIS IS 
THE MAGIC TRICK, HUH?

32
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:16,909
- ILLUSION, MICHAEL.

33
00:01:16,909 --> 00:01:19,036
A TRICK IS SOMETHING 
A WHORE DOES FOR MONEY.

34
00:01:22,498 --> 00:01:24,709
OR CANDY.

35
00:01:24,709 --> 00:01:27,712
narrator: GOB RECENTLY STARTED 
THE ALLIANCE OF MAGICIANS,

36
00:01:27,712 --> 00:01:30,298
AN ORGANIZATION THAT BLACKBALLS 
ANY PERFORMER

37
00:01:30,298 --> 00:01:32,842
WHO REVEALS A MAGICIAN'S SECRET.

38
00:01:32,842 --> 00:01:34,344
AND FINALLY, 
THERE'S BUSTER...

39
00:01:34,344 --> 00:01:35,195
- HEY, BUSTER.

40
00:01:35,195 --> 00:01:38,389
narrator: THE YOUNGEST 
OF MICHAEL'S SIBLINGS.

41
00:01:38,389 --> 00:01:40,225
- YOU KNOW, YOU DON'T NEED 
TO DO THAT, BUDDY.

42
00:01:40,225 --> 00:01:41,267
IT'S OKAY.

43
00:01:41,267 --> 00:01:42,727
narrator: 
THANKS TO THE FAMILY'S LARGES,

44
00:01:42,727 --> 00:01:44,229
BUSTER HAS STUDIED EVERYTHING.

45
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:48,858
FROM NATIVE AMERICAN 
TRIBAL CEREMONIES...

46
00:01:48,858 --> 00:01:52,612
TO CARTOGRAPHY, THE MAPPING 
OF UNCHARTED TERRITORIES.

47
00:01:52,612 --> 00:01:54,530
- HASN'T EVERYTHING ALREADY 
SORT OF BEEN DISCOVERED, THOUGH,

48
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:58,284
BY, LIKE, MAGELLAN AND CORTEZ...

49
00:01:58,284 --> 00:02:00,035
- OH, YEAH, YEAH. 
- ALL THOSE FOLKS?

50
00:02:00,035 --> 00:02:01,954
- THOSE GUYS DID 
A PRETTY GOOD JOB,

51
00:02:01,954 --> 00:02:05,225
BUT THERE'S STILL, 
YOU KNOW--

52
00:02:05,225 --> 00:02:09,587
narrator: HE ALSO SUFFERS 
FROM CRIPPLING PANIC ATTACKS.

53
00:02:09,587 --> 00:02:11,131
YES, THIS IS HIS FAMILY.

54
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:13,799
SO WHY IS MICHAEL SO HAPPY?

55
00:02:13,799 --> 00:02:17,470
BECAUSE HE'S DECIDED TO NEVER 
SPEAK TO THESE PEOPLE AGAIN.

56
00:02:24,227 --> 00:02:27,104
MICHAEL WAS FEELING MORE 
GENEROUS ABOUT HIS FAMILY

57
00:02:27,104 --> 00:02:29,274
ON THE MORNING 
OF THE BOAT PARTY.

58
00:02:29,274 --> 00:02:30,650
- WHAT COMES BEFORE ANYTHING?

59
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:35,405
WHAT HAVE WE ALWAYS SAID 
IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING?

60
00:02:35,405 --> 00:02:36,697
- BREAKFAST.

61
00:02:36,697 --> 00:02:37,907
- FAMILY.

62
00:02:37,907 --> 00:02:39,992
- FAMILY, RIGHT.

63
00:02:39,992 --> 00:02:41,369
I THOUGHT YOU MEANT 
OF THE THINGS YOU EAT.

64
00:02:41,369 --> 00:02:44,497
narrator: THIS IS MICHAEL'S SON, 
GEORGE MICHAEL.

65
00:02:44,497 --> 00:02:47,250
I MEAN, WE HAVE MADE NOTHING 
BUT SACRIFICES FOR THIS FAMILY,

66
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:49,210
AND TONIGHT 
IT ALL PAYS OFF, MY BOY.

67
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:51,254
TONIGHT YOUR GRANDDAD 
MAKES ME PARTNER.

68
00:02:51,254 --> 00:02:53,214
narrator: 
TO PROVE HIS DEDICATION

69
00:02:53,214 --> 00:02:54,715
TO THE FAMILY BUSINESS,

70
00:02:54,715 --> 00:02:56,050
MICHAEL HAS DECIDED 
TO LIVE HERE

71
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:59,970
IN THE MODEL UNIT OF HIS 
FATHER'S LATEST HOUSING TRACT.

72
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:01,764
THE GUYS LIVE IN THE ATTIC 
SO THAT THE HOUSE

73
00:03:01,764 --> 00:03:04,475
CAN STILL FUNCTION 
AS A PRISTINE SELLING TOOL.

74
00:03:04,475 --> 00:03:06,436
- AND WHEN I DO GET 
THAT PROMOTION,

75
00:03:06,436 --> 00:03:09,689
I'LL FINALLY BE ABLE 
TO GET YOU WHAT YOU DESERVE,

76
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:11,566
LIKE A REAL HOME.

77
00:03:11,566 --> 00:03:13,484
- THIS IS A REAL HOME.

78
00:03:13,484 --> 00:03:16,612
- NO, IT'S NOT. 
IT'S A FAKE HOME, SON.

79
00:03:16,612 --> 00:03:18,906
YOU WANT THE LOOPS 
OR THE FLAKES TODAY?

80
00:03:18,906 --> 00:03:20,741
narrator: THE GUYS THEN HEADED 
DOWN TO BALBOA ISLAND

81
00:03:20,741 --> 00:03:23,369
SO GEORGE MICHAEL COULD WORK 
AT THE FROZEN BANANA STAND

82
00:03:23,369 --> 00:03:26,331
HIS GRANDFATHER STARTED IN 1953.

83
00:03:26,331 --> 00:03:27,582
- BANANAS.

84
00:03:27,582 --> 00:03:29,834
narrator: MICHAEL, MEANWHILE, 
WAS MEETING HIS BROTHER GOB,

85
00:03:29,834 --> 00:03:32,837
HOPING TO DISCUSS 
HIS FATHER'S BOAT PARTY.

86
00:03:32,837 --> 00:03:35,256
- DO YOU HAVE YOUR CHECK 
FOR YOUR SHARE OF THE PARTY?

87
00:03:35,256 --> 00:03:38,301
- YOU KNOW, I SORT OF THOUGHT 
MY CONTRIBUTION

88
00:03:38,301 --> 00:03:42,054
COULD BE A MAGIC SHOW.

89
00:03:42,054 --> 00:03:43,138
- OH, THAT'S PERFECT, GOB. 
- THANK YOU.

90
00:03:43,138 --> 00:03:44,474
- OR WAIT A MINUTE.

91
00:03:44,474 --> 00:03:47,518
I JUST REMEMBERED SOMETHING. 
DAD'S RETIRING, NOT TURNING SIX.

92
00:03:47,518 --> 00:03:48,519
- HEY, COME ON.

93
00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:51,272
I JUST BOUGHT THIS NEW ILLUSION 
CALLED THE AZTEC TOMB.

94
00:03:51,272 --> 00:03:53,148
IT COST, LIKE, 18 GRAND.

95
00:03:53,148 --> 00:03:55,067
I'M GONNA DO IT ON THE BOAT.

96
00:03:55,067 --> 00:03:56,110
WHAT DO YOU CARE?

97
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:57,945
CAN'T YOU JUST CHARGE 
THE PARTY TO THE COMPANY?

98
00:03:57,945 --> 00:03:59,113
- NO, 
IT'S NOT A BUSINESS EXPENSE.

99
00:03:59,113 --> 00:04:00,240
- SO WHAT?

100
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,657
LINDSAY'S BEEN STAYING 
AT THE FOUR SEASONS FOR A MONTH.

101
00:04:01,657 --> 00:04:03,451
SHE'S PROBABLY 
CHARGING THE COMPANY.

102
00:04:03,451 --> 00:04:05,453
- LINDSAY'S BEEN 
IN TOWN FOR A MONTH?

103
00:04:05,453 --> 00:04:09,540
- I DON'T THINK SO.

104
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:11,834
narrator: 
MICHAEL WAS UPSET TO HEAR THIS,

105
00:04:11,834 --> 00:04:13,711
SO HE WENT TO DISCUSS IT 
WITH HIS MOTHER.

106
00:04:13,711 --> 00:04:15,255
- MOM. MOTHER.

107
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:16,381
GIVE ME 
YOUR COMPANY CHECKBOOK.

108
00:04:16,381 --> 00:04:17,548
YOU'RE CUT OFF.

109
00:04:17,548 --> 00:04:19,133
- MICHAEL, LOOK.

110
00:04:19,133 --> 00:04:21,093
LOOK WHAT HAPPENED TO MY FOX.

111
00:04:21,093 --> 00:04:24,138
SOMEONE CUT OFF 
HIS LITTLE FOOT.

112
00:04:24,138 --> 00:04:26,098
IS IT--IS IT NOTICEABLE?

113
00:04:26,098 --> 00:04:27,808
- WELL, 
YOU'VE GOTTA REMEMBER,

114
00:04:27,808 --> 00:04:29,394
YOU'RE GONNA BE ALL 
SPLATTERED IN RED PAINT.

115
00:04:29,394 --> 00:04:31,437
THAT'S GONNA 
DISTRACT THE EYE.

116
00:04:31,437 --> 00:04:32,772
I DON'T WANT YOU CHARGING 
ANY MORE

117
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:34,940
OF YOUR PERSONAL EXPENSES 
TO THE COMPANY.

118
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:37,151
- WELL, I HAD TO PAY 
FOR THE AZTEC TOMB.

119
00:04:37,151 --> 00:04:38,653
GOB SAYS IT'S A CAREER-MAKER.

120
00:04:38,653 --> 00:04:39,779
- WAIT A MINUTE.

121
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:41,238
THE COMPANY PAID 
FOR THE AZTEC TOMB?

122
00:04:41,238 --> 00:04:42,239
THAT'S GREAT.

123
00:04:42,239 --> 00:04:44,241
WELL, I WAS TALKING 
ABOUT LINDSAY, OKAY?

124
00:04:44,241 --> 00:04:46,160
YOU PUT HER IN 
A FIVE-STAR HOTEL

125
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,704
ON TOP OF WHICH YOU DIDN'T EVEN 
TELL ME THAT SHE WAS IN TOWN.

126
00:04:48,704 --> 00:04:51,206
- IF YOU'RE SAYING 
I PLAY FAVORITES, YOU'RE WRONG.

127
00:04:51,206 --> 00:04:53,334
I LOVE ALL MY CHILDREN EQUALLY.

128
00:04:53,334 --> 00:04:57,880
I DON'T CARE FOR GOB.

129
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:01,216
GOOD GRIEF; I DIPPED INTO 
THE KITTY A COUPLE OF TIMES.

130
00:05:01,216 --> 00:05:03,010
YOU SHOULD BE FOCUSED 
ON TONIGHT.

131
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:06,556
DAD'S MAKING A BIG ANNOUNCEMENT.

132
00:05:06,556 --> 00:05:07,973
- YEAH?

133
00:05:07,973 --> 00:05:11,686
I KNEW IT. 
IT'S ABOUT ME, ISN'T IT?

134
00:05:11,686 --> 00:05:13,813
I WONDER HOW I CAN TALK YOU 
OUT OF EVER MAKING

135
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:15,356
THAT FACE AGAIN.

136
00:05:15,356 --> 00:05:16,857
- MICHAEL.

137
00:05:16,857 --> 00:05:18,359
- TOBIAS.

138
00:05:18,359 --> 00:05:20,986
- HOW ARE YOU?

139
00:05:20,986 --> 00:05:22,154
[laughs]

140
00:05:22,154 --> 00:05:23,698
- GOOD, GOOD.

141
00:05:23,698 --> 00:05:27,660
HOW'S YOUR JOB SEARCH COMIN'?

142
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:28,661
- IT'S GOOD.

143
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:30,330
IT'S GOING TO BE GOOD. 
IT'S GOING TO BE GOOD.

144
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:33,207
I'M HOPING THE UNIVERSE 
PROVIDES A PATH FOR ME.

145
00:05:33,207 --> 00:05:35,876
narrator: TOBIAS RECENTLY LOST 
HIS MEDICAL LICENSE

146
00:05:35,876 --> 00:05:38,879
FOR ADMINISTERING C.P.R. TO 
A PERSON WHO, AS IT TURNED OUT,

147
00:05:38,879 --> 00:05:41,632
WAS NOT HAVING A HEART ATTACK.

148
00:05:41,632 --> 00:05:43,968
- MAYBE YOU'LL BE INSPIRED 
BY THE BOAT PARTY TONIGHT,

149
00:05:43,968 --> 00:05:46,762
START A CAREER AS A PIRATE.

150
00:05:46,762 --> 00:05:49,348
- I HAVEN'T PACKED FOR THAT.

151
00:05:49,348 --> 00:05:51,684
- COULDN'T FIND A THING. 
- LINDSAY.

152
00:05:51,684 --> 00:05:53,352
- MICHAEL.

153
00:05:53,352 --> 00:05:54,895
- HOW WAS YOUR FLIGHT?

154
00:05:54,895 --> 00:05:56,939
- GREAT. GREAT. 
WE JUST GOT IN...

155
00:05:56,939 --> 00:05:58,566
- HE KNOWS. 
- A MONTH AGO.

156
00:05:58,566 --> 00:06:00,610
OH, I'M SORRY. 
I'VE BEEN MEANING TO CALL YOU.

157
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:01,652
I REALLY HAVE.

158
00:06:01,652 --> 00:06:03,863
- REALLY? 
- IT'S JUST BEEN VERY BUSY.

159
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:05,280
- UGH. IT'S BEEN CRAZY.

160
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:08,493
- WE JUST HAD AN AMAZING 
FUND-RAISER FOR HOOP.

161
00:06:08,493 --> 00:06:09,910
- HOOP?

162
00:06:09,910 --> 00:06:11,579
- MY ANTI-CIRCUMCISION 
MOVEMENT.

163
00:06:11,579 --> 00:06:13,414
I THINK IT LOOKS FRIGHTENING 
WHEN IT'S CUT OFF.

164
00:06:13,414 --> 00:06:15,750
IT'S A DOBERMAN. 
LET IT HAVE ITS EARS.

165
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:16,834
- HMM.

166
00:06:16,834 --> 00:06:20,379
- BELIEVE IT OR NOT, 
WE BROUGHT IN OVER $40,000.

167
00:06:20,379 --> 00:06:20,480
- UNBELIEVABLE.

168
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:23,758
SOUNDS LIKE YOU SAVED ENOUGH 
SKIN TO MAKE 10 NEW BOYS.

169
00:06:23,758 --> 00:06:26,093
- WELL, MOST OF THAT MONEY 
WAS FROM THE BLUTH COMPANY.

170
00:06:26,093 --> 00:06:30,347
- [clears throat] 
- I MEAN, HOW...

171
00:06:30,347 --> 00:06:32,850
ARE YOU?

172
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:34,393
- STILL GOOD. 
YOU KNOW WHAT?

173
00:06:34,393 --> 00:06:36,979
YOU GUYS HAVE HAD YOUR HANDS 
IN THE COMPANY COFFER FOR YEARS.

174
00:06:36,979 --> 00:06:40,483
BUT STARTING TOMORROW, THERE IS 
GOING TO BE A NEW BOSS IN TOWN,

175
00:06:40,483 --> 00:06:42,902
AND YOU'RE ALL GONNA HAVE TO 
START FENDING FOR YOURSELVES.

176
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:45,237
YOU'RE ALL GONNA FINALLY FEEL

177
00:06:45,237 --> 00:06:47,406
THAT SWEET STING OF SWEAT 
IN YOUR EYES AS...

178
00:06:47,406 --> 00:06:48,908
[drum pounding]

179
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:53,954
BUSTER, YOU CAN'T DO THAT 
ON THE BALCONY, BUDDY?

180
00:06:53,954 --> 00:06:58,543
- MOM SAYS IT'S TOO WINDY.

181
00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:01,796
- WHO COULD'VE DONE THIS?

182
00:07:01,796 --> 00:07:04,131
narrator: WHILE MICHAEL WAS 
GETTING FED UP WITH HIS FAMILY,

183
00:07:04,131 --> 00:07:07,552
GEORGE MICHAEL WAS FINALLY 
GETTING TO KNOW THEM.

184
00:07:07,552 --> 00:07:10,304
- UM, YEAH, 
I BOUGHT A FROZEN BANANA,

185
00:07:10,304 --> 00:07:13,974
AND WHEN I BIT INTO IT, 
I FOUND THIS.

186
00:07:13,974 --> 00:07:15,435
- LOOKS LIKE A FOOT.

187
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:18,813
- IT TASTED LIKE A FOOT, 
WHICH I DIDN'T REALLY MIND,

188
00:07:18,813 --> 00:07:21,441
BUT I'M PRETTY SURE 
I SAID, "NO NUTS."

189
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:24,068
- HEY, YOU'RE MY COUSIN, 
AREN'T YOU?

190
00:07:24,068 --> 00:07:25,194
- MAYBE.

191
00:07:25,194 --> 00:07:29,239
narrator: THIS IS GEORGE 
MICHAEL'S COUSIN, MAEBY.

192
00:07:29,239 --> 00:07:30,407
- I CAN'T BELIEVE 
YOU DIDN'T RECOGNIZE ME.

193
00:07:30,407 --> 00:07:32,034
- WE NEVER SEE YOU.

194
00:07:32,034 --> 00:07:33,786
WE NEVER SEE ANYBODY 
IN OUR FAMILY.

195
00:07:33,786 --> 00:07:35,705
- I KNOW. 
IT'S OUR PARENTS' FAULTS.

196
00:07:35,705 --> 00:07:37,457
- WE SHOULD TEACH THEM A LESSON.

197
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:41,126
- [laughs] 
YEAH, RIGHT.

198
00:07:41,126 --> 00:07:42,462
NO, I DON'T THINK SO.

199
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:44,129
- I SHOULD GO 
TO MY MOM TONIGHT

200
00:07:44,129 --> 00:07:45,465
AND BE LIKE, 
"I MET THE CUTEST GUY,"

201
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:47,717
AND THEN SHE'LL SEE YOU 
AND ME TOTALLY MAKING OUT.

202
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:50,636
- [laughs] 
YEAH.

203
00:07:50,636 --> 00:07:53,097
BUT--BUT NOT REALLY, RIGHT?

204
00:07:53,097 --> 00:07:55,057
- IT'S PERFECT. 
SHE'D FREAK OUT.

205
00:07:55,057 --> 00:07:56,767
AND I'D BE LIKE, "MOM, IF WE SAW 
EACH OTHER MORE OFTEN,

206
00:07:56,767 --> 00:07:57,893
THIS WOULDN'T HAPPEN."

207
00:07:57,893 --> 00:07:58,936
- BUT WE'RE COUSINS.

208
00:07:58,936 --> 00:08:00,020
- THAT'S WHAT MAKES IT FUNNY.

209
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:01,731
- BUT ISN'T IT AGAINST THE LAW?

210
00:08:01,731 --> 00:08:05,776
- COME ON, GEORGE MICHAEL.

211
00:08:08,696 --> 00:08:10,781
narrator: TOBIAS, NOW BELIEVING 
THE BOAT PARTY

212
00:08:10,781 --> 00:08:12,157
TO BE PIRATE-THEMED...

213
00:08:12,157 --> 00:08:13,283
YOU LOOK LIKE A PIRATE.

214
00:08:13,283 --> 00:08:14,535
narrator: BEGAN SEARCHING 
THROUGH HIS WIFE'S LUGGAGE

215
00:08:14,535 --> 00:08:15,620
FOR AN OUTFIT.

216
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:18,288
- I SHOULD SAY SO. 
LOOK AT THE BLOUSE, SIR.

217
00:08:18,288 --> 00:08:19,707
narrator: 
THEN, MISTAKING A GROUP

218
00:08:19,707 --> 00:08:22,502
OF GARISHLY DRESSED MEN 
FOR PIRATES,

219
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:26,922
TOBIAS BOARDED A VAN 
FULL OF HOMOSEXUALS.

220
00:08:26,922 --> 00:08:28,883
SOON HE WAS UNWITTINGLY 
PART OF A PROTEST

221
00:08:28,883 --> 00:08:31,594
AGAINST THE LOCAL YACHT CLUB.

222
00:08:31,594 --> 00:08:33,638
- HOW ARE YOU?

223
00:08:33,638 --> 00:08:35,973
- OH, MY GOD. 
I HAVE THE EXACT SAME BLOUSE.

224
00:08:35,973 --> 00:08:39,101
- I LIKE IT BETTER ON HIM.

225
00:08:39,101 --> 00:08:42,146
narrator: AND MICHAEL'S 
BIG MOMENT FINALLY CAME.

226
00:08:42,146 --> 00:08:45,900
I GIVE YOU THE NEW C.E.O. 
FOR THE BLUTH COMPANY,

227
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:49,654
CERTAINLY THE SMARTEST BLUTH,

228
00:08:49,654 --> 00:08:51,446
MY FAVORITE BLUTH,

229
00:08:51,446 --> 00:08:54,241
AND THE, UH, SEXIEST CREATURE

230
00:08:54,241 --> 00:08:58,913
I HAVE EVER LAID EYES ON,

231
00:08:58,913 --> 00:09:00,247
MY LOVELY WIFE, LUCILLE.

232
00:09:00,247 --> 00:09:01,874

233
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:05,586
[cheers and applause]

234
00:09:05,586 --> 00:09:06,796
- MOM.

235
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:09,298

236
00:09:09,298 --> 00:09:10,507

LOVE.

237
00:09:10,507 --> 00:09:13,844
LOVE WILL KEEP US TOGETHER.

238
00:09:13,844 --> 00:09:14,970
- SORRY. 
IT'S NOT THE RIGHT TIME.

239
00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:17,973
- [singing] 
THINK OF ME, BABE, WHENEVER

240
00:09:17,973 --> 00:09:22,186
SOME SWEET-TALKIN' GIRL 
COMES ALONG, SINGIN'...

241
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:26,666
- I'M NOT GONNA LIE 
TO YOU, MICHAEL.

242
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:32,112
THIS IS GREAT NEWS FOR HOOP.

243
00:09:32,112 --> 00:09:34,907
- [singing] 
NOT MUCH MORE I'M ASKIN' FOR

244
00:09:34,907 --> 00:09:36,408
FREE

245
00:09:36,408 --> 00:09:39,119
FREE AT LAST

246
00:09:39,119 --> 00:09:42,915
I'M TALKIN' ABOUT FREEDOM

247
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:45,626
FREEDOM

248
00:09:45,626 --> 00:09:46,686
- HEY.

249
00:09:46,686 --> 00:09:48,671
- YOU OKAY?

250
00:09:48,671 --> 00:09:50,214
- YOU AND I, 
WE'VE WAITED LONG ENOUGH.

251
00:09:50,214 --> 00:09:51,716
IT'S TIME TO MOVE ON.

252
00:09:51,716 --> 00:09:55,761
ALL RIGHT?

253
00:09:55,761 --> 00:09:58,222
- I GUESS WE'RE GONNA SEE 
YOU GUYS EVEN LESS NOW.

254
00:09:58,222 --> 00:09:59,473
- I TOLD YOU.

255
00:09:59,473 --> 00:10:00,515
WE SHOULD'VE TAUGHT THEM 
A LESSON.

256
00:10:00,515 --> 00:10:03,352
- LINDSAY, I WANT YOU 
IN THIS PICTURE. COME ON.

257
00:10:08,858 --> 00:10:10,525
ALL RIGHT, 
LET'S SEE SOME SMILES, PEOPLE.

258
00:10:10,525 --> 00:10:14,238
IT'S A--IT'S A PARTY, 
NOT A SHAREHOLDERS' MEETING.

259
00:10:14,238 --> 00:10:16,115
[sirens wailing]

260
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:17,950
- ARE THOSE POLICE BOATS?

261
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:19,451
[rimshot]

262
00:10:19,451 --> 00:10:21,495
NO, I'M SERIOUS. 
I THINK THEY ARE POLICE BOATS.

263
00:10:21,495 --> 00:10:23,372
- PREPARE TO BE BOARDED.

264
00:10:23,372 --> 00:10:24,749
PREPARE TO BE BOARDED.

265
00:10:24,749 --> 00:10:26,500
- I KNEW IT WAS AGAINST THE LAW.

266
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:29,211
- THAT'S THE SECURITIES 
AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION.

267
00:10:29,211 --> 00:10:30,295
- THEY HAVE BOATS?

268
00:10:30,295 --> 00:10:31,338
- GIVE ME A CELL PHONE.

269
00:10:31,338 --> 00:10:33,423
- LINDSAY, BUSTER, 
UP TO THE BRIDGE.

270
00:10:33,423 --> 00:10:35,467
COME ON, BUSTER.

271
00:10:35,467 --> 00:10:36,636
ALMIGHTY GOOD GRIEF.

272
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:37,887
- DELORES, LISTEN TO ME.

273
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:40,264
EMPTY THE ACCOUNT.

274
00:10:40,264 --> 00:10:41,932
WHY ARE YOU CRYING?

275
00:10:41,932 --> 00:10:42,975
WHY ARE YOU CRYING?

276
00:10:42,975 --> 00:10:44,977
- OUT OF MY WAY. 
OUT. OUT. OUT.

277
00:10:44,977 --> 00:10:46,186
LINDSAY, TAKE THE WHEEL.

278
00:10:46,186 --> 00:10:47,897
BUSTER, FIND US A CHANNEL 
TO THE OCEAN.

279
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:49,774
- GEE, I DON'T HAVE ANY 
MAPPING EQUIPMENT WITH ME.

280
00:10:49,774 --> 00:10:52,359
- YOU'VE HAD $80,000 
WORTH OF CARTOGRAPHY LESSONS.

281
00:10:52,359 --> 00:10:53,903
GET US A CHANNEL TO THE OCEAN.

282
00:10:53,903 --> 00:10:55,755
- OKAY. OKAY. OKAY.

283
00:10:55,755 --> 00:10:57,907
- CAN YOU HEAR ME NOW?

284
00:10:57,907 --> 00:10:59,909
- OBVIOUSLY, THIS BLUE PART 
HERE IS THE LAND.

285
00:10:59,909 --> 00:11:03,078
AND THAT WOULD MEAN--

286
00:11:03,078 --> 00:11:05,247
OH, BUSTER, BUSTER, 
YOU'LL BE ALL RIGHT.

287
00:11:05,247 --> 00:11:08,000
- SHREDDER. NO. SAVE IT. 
SAVE IT. SHREDDER.

288
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,170
- PLEASE, DON'T LEAVE US NOW, 
BUSTER, PLEASE.

289
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:13,338
- GET IN THE TOMB, 
THE AZTEC TOMB.

290
00:11:13,338 --> 00:11:16,341
- HOLD ON. I DON'T HAVE TIME 
FOR YOUR MAGIC TRICKS.

291
00:11:16,341 --> 00:11:17,384
- ILLUSIONS, DAD.

292
00:11:17,384 --> 00:11:19,303
YOU DON'T HAVE TIME 
FOR MY ILLUSIONS.

293
00:11:19,303 --> 00:11:21,764
- WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU? 
WHY ARE YOU SO ANGRY?

294
00:11:21,764 --> 00:11:24,308
- LOOK, JUST STAY IN THE BOX. 
I'LL MAKE YOU DISAPPEAR.

295
00:11:24,308 --> 00:11:28,062
narrator: THE BLUTH FAMILY 
DOMINATED THE NEWS THAT NIGHT.

296
00:11:28,062 --> 00:11:30,773
- BLUTH DEVELOPMENT COMPANY 
PRESIDENT GEORGE BLUTH

297
00:11:30,773 --> 00:11:33,859
WAS ARRESTED TONIGHT 
FOR DEFRAUDING INVESTORS

298
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:37,612
AND USING THE COMPANY 
AS HIS PERSONAL PIGGY BANK.

299
00:11:37,612 --> 00:11:38,823
MORE INTRIGUE 
ON THE HIGH SEAS TONIGHT

300
00:11:38,823 --> 00:11:41,075
AS DOZENS OF LOCAL PIRATES 
WERE ARRESTED

301
00:11:41,075 --> 00:11:45,120
FOR PROTESTING THE YACHT CLUB'S 
DISCRIMINATORY POLICIES.

302
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,081
narrator: EVEN MICHAEL'S BROTHER 
GOB MADE THE NEWS.

303
00:11:47,081 --> 00:11:50,835
- IT WAS MR. BLUTH'S SON, GOB, 
A PART-TIME MAGICIAN,

304
00:11:50,835 --> 00:11:53,921
WHO HID HIS FATHER HERE 
IN THE AZTEC TOMB

305
00:11:53,921 --> 00:11:56,548
BY PUSHING ON THIS 
PIVOTING PANEL--

306
00:11:56,548 --> 00:11:59,134
- I HAVE TO THINK THE ALLIANCE 
IS GONNA FROWN ON THIS.

307
00:11:59,134 --> 00:12:01,053
- PERHAPS A GOOD TRICK 
FOR A HUMAN,

308
00:12:01,053 --> 00:12:03,889
BUT THE DOGS FOUND HIM 
ALMOST INSTANTLY.

309
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:06,433
- FREE AT LAST, DARLINGS.

310
00:12:06,433 --> 00:12:08,143
- I'M ALL RIGHT. 
- THANK GOD.

311
00:12:08,143 --> 00:12:09,686
- OH, WHAT AN ADVENTURE.

312
00:12:09,686 --> 00:12:10,771
OH, MY GOODNESS.

313
00:12:10,771 --> 00:12:13,816
BUSTER, DON'T DO THAT.

314
00:12:13,816 --> 00:12:15,609
WHAT AN ADVENTURE, GANG.

315
00:12:15,609 --> 00:12:18,028
I THOUGHT THAT 
THE HOMOSEXUALS WERE PIRATES,

316
00:12:18,028 --> 00:12:19,947
BUT IT TURNS OUT THAT 
MOST OF THEM WERE ACTORS

317
00:12:19,947 --> 00:12:21,615
IN THE LOCAL THEATER.

318
00:12:21,615 --> 00:12:24,576
[chuckles]

319
00:12:24,576 --> 00:12:25,953
YOU'RE RIGHT, THOUGH. 
IT IS AMAZING.

320
00:12:25,953 --> 00:12:27,537
I'VE BEEN WAITING 
FOR THE UNIVERSE

321
00:12:27,537 --> 00:12:30,540
TO PROVIDE A PATH FOR ME, 
AND--

322
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:32,877
AND I THINK IT HAS.

323
00:12:32,877 --> 00:12:35,004
- YOU'RE GAY? 
- NO. NO.

324
00:12:35,004 --> 00:12:37,172
NO, I'M NOT--I'M NOT GAY.

325
00:12:37,172 --> 00:12:40,467
NO, LINDSAY, HOW MANY 
TIMES MUST WE HAVE THIS--

326
00:12:40,467 --> 00:12:44,763
NO, 
I WANT TO BE AN ACTOR.

327
00:12:45,865 --> 00:12:47,933
[chuckles]

328
00:12:47,933 --> 00:12:50,227
- OKAY, GUYS. UM,

329
00:12:50,227 --> 00:12:52,271
THEY ARE GONNA 
KEEP DAD IN PRISON

330
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:55,232
AT LEAST UNTIL THIS 
GETS ALL SORTED OUT.

331
00:12:55,232 --> 00:12:57,359
ALSO, THE ATTORNEY SAID THEY'RE 
GONNA HAVE TO PUT A HALT

332
00:12:57,359 --> 00:12:58,777
ON THE COMPANY'S 
EXPENSE ACCOUNT.

333
00:12:58,777 --> 00:13:00,529
[all gasp]

334
00:13:00,529 --> 00:13:01,864
INTERESTING; 
I WOULD HAVE EXPECTED THAT

335
00:13:01,864 --> 00:13:03,198
AFTER THE, 
"KEEPING DAD IN JAIL."

336
00:13:03,198 --> 00:13:06,827
- YOU KNOW, MICHAEL, DAD DID 
NAME MOM AS HIS SUCCESSOR.

337
00:13:06,827 --> 00:13:09,621
- AND I'M PUTTING BUSTER 
IN CHARGE.

338
00:13:09,621 --> 00:13:11,832
- THAT'S A GOOD CHOICE. 
- BUSTER?

339
00:13:11,832 --> 00:13:15,836
THE GUY WHO THOUGHT THAT 
THE BLUE ON THE MAP WAS LAND?

340
00:13:15,836 --> 00:13:17,087
- HE'S HAD BUSINESS CLASSES.

341
00:13:17,087 --> 00:13:20,590
- WA-WA-WA-WAIT, 
18TH-CENTURY AGRARIAN BUSINESS.

342
00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:24,594
BUT I GUESS IT'S ALL 
THE SAME PRINCIPLES.

343
00:13:24,594 --> 00:13:26,513
ARE YOU AT ALL CONCERNED 
ABOUT AN UPRISING?

344
00:13:26,513 --> 00:13:27,681
- THAT'S IT. 
I'M DONE.

345
00:13:27,681 --> 00:13:29,808
I'M SICK AND TIRED OF THE GREED

346
00:13:29,808 --> 00:13:31,936
AND THE SELFISHNESS 
AND ALL THE TAKING.

347
00:13:31,936 --> 00:13:33,437
FORGET IT. 
I'VE GOT A SON TO THINK ABOUT.

348
00:13:33,437 --> 00:13:36,190
AND, LINDSAY, BY THE WAY, 
I EXPECTED THIS FROM THEM,

349
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:38,067
BECAUSE THEY'RE 
COMPLETELY OBLIVIOUS.

350
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:42,612
BUT YOU-- 
YOU SHOULD KNOW BETTER.

351
00:13:42,612 --> 00:13:44,698
narrator: 
IN THE DAYS THAT FOLLOWED,

352
00:13:44,698 --> 00:13:47,367
LINDSAY HAD NO CHOICE 
BUT TO CHECK HER FAMILY

353
00:13:47,367 --> 00:13:49,786
OUT OF THE HOTEL 
EARLIER THAN PLANNED.

354
00:13:57,211 --> 00:13:59,129
AND HER HUSBAND 
STARTED LOOKING FOR WORK.

355
00:13:59,129 --> 00:14:01,631
- MY NAME IS DR. TOBIAS FUNKE.

356
00:14:01,631 --> 00:14:04,301
I WAS CHIEF RESIDENT 
OF PSYCHIATRY AT MASS GENERAL

357
00:14:04,301 --> 00:14:05,344
FOR TWO YEARS,

358
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:09,139
AND I DID MY FELLOWSHIP 
IN PSYCHOLINGUISTICS AT M.I.T.

359
00:14:09,139 --> 00:14:10,765
AND THIS IS

360
00:14:10,765 --> 00:14:13,685
"I'M A BAD, BAD MAN" 
FROM "ANNIE GET YOUR GUN."

361
00:14:13,685 --> 00:14:17,647
[upbeat piano music]

362
00:14:17,647 --> 00:14:20,734
[singing] 
I-I--I'M--

363
00:14:20,734 --> 00:14:22,111
narrator: LUCILLE WAS 
FINDING IT DIFFICULT

364
00:14:22,111 --> 00:14:23,487
TO GO ABOUT HER DAILY LIFE.

365
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:25,822
- THE S.E.C. IS MAKING HIM OUT 
TO BE SOME KIND OF MASTERMIND,

366
00:14:25,822 --> 00:14:27,032
WHICH--BELIEVE ME--HE'S NOT.

367
00:14:27,032 --> 00:14:29,159
THE MAN CAN BARELY 
WORK OUR SHREDDER.

368
00:14:29,159 --> 00:14:30,660
narrator: 
MICHAEL WAS ABLE TO SECURE

369
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:33,372
A JOB WITH A RIVAL HOUSING 
COMPANY ALMOST IMMEDIATELY.

370
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:36,876
- WE'LL SET YOU UP IN ARIZONA 
IN ONE OF OUR FINEST ESTATES.

371
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:41,463
- ATTIC OR MAIN HOUSE?

372
00:14:41,463 --> 00:14:44,674
- [laughs]

373
00:14:44,674 --> 00:14:46,093
narrator: AND BUSTER 
WAS DISCOVERING

374
00:14:46,093 --> 00:14:48,720
HIS ACADEMIC PURSUITS 
DIDN'T FULLY PREPARE HIM

375
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,347
FOR HIS NEW RESPONSIBILITIES.

376
00:14:50,347 --> 00:14:51,431
- HAVE YOU LOOKED 
AT THE LATEST FIGURES

377
00:14:51,431 --> 00:14:52,807
ON 
THE SUDDEN VALLEY EXPANSION...

378
00:14:52,807 --> 00:14:54,935
VIS-A-VIS THE DEVELOPMENT 
VERSUS THE TAX...

379
00:14:54,935 --> 00:14:56,436
- YOU GUYS ARE SO SMART.

380
00:14:56,436 --> 00:14:57,729
- 2% PER ANNUM.

381
00:14:57,729 --> 00:14:59,189
THIS IS A NON-RECOUPABLE...

382
00:14:59,189 --> 00:15:00,690
- WE NEED MICHAEL.

383
00:15:00,690 --> 00:15:02,651
- WE NEED ICE.

384
00:15:02,651 --> 00:15:05,112
- [muffled] MICHAEL. 
WE NEED MICHAEL.

385
00:15:05,112 --> 00:15:07,072
narrator: AND SO THE FAMILY 
STAGED AN INTERVENTION.

386
00:15:07,072 --> 00:15:08,282
- I'M SORRY.

387
00:15:08,282 --> 00:15:11,618
WHAT EXACTLY 
IS THIS INTERVENTION FOR?

388
00:15:13,703 --> 00:15:16,165
- WE NEED YOU TO COME BACK 
AND RUN THE BUSINESS.

389
00:15:16,165 --> 00:15:18,959
- OKAY, SO TECHNICALLY IT'S 
NOT REALLY AN INTERVENTION.

390
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:21,170
IT'S MORE OF AN IMPOSITION 
IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT.

391
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:22,671
- WHATEVER YOU WANT TO CALL IT.

392
00:15:22,671 --> 00:15:24,339
- I'D LOVE TO CALL IT 
AN IMPOSITION.

393
00:15:24,339 --> 00:15:25,882
- WE'RE IN TROUBLE HERE, 
MICHAEL.

394
00:15:25,882 --> 00:15:27,759
AND I CAN'T PERFORM MY MAGIC.

395
00:15:27,759 --> 00:15:30,429
I'M GETTING BLACKBALLED 
FROM EVEN THE SMALLER VENUES.

396
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:31,763
- I'LL BE HONEST.

397
00:15:31,763 --> 00:15:34,308
I'M JUST MORE COMFORTABLE WITH 
AN ALLIANCE-APPROVED MAGICIAN.

398
00:15:34,308 --> 00:15:37,519
- [scoffs]

399
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:40,647
GIVE 'EM A HELL 
OF A SHOW, CHAMP.

400
00:15:40,647 --> 00:15:44,193
- [bleep] OFF, TRAITOR.

401
00:15:44,193 --> 00:15:45,652
- CAN YOU BELIEVE THIS? 
THEY'RE STILL FIGHTING.

402
00:15:45,652 --> 00:15:48,197
- YEAH, I KNOW.

403
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:51,200
I'M TEMPTED TO KISS AGAIN 
SO WE COULD TEACH 'EM A LESSON.

404
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,617
- WHY WOULD THAT 
TEACH THEM A LESSON?

405
00:15:52,617 --> 00:15:56,080
- NO, I MEAN, UH, 
TO FREAK THEM OUT.

406
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,747
- YEAH, BUT THAT DOESN'T MAKE 
ANY SENSE.

407
00:15:57,747 --> 00:15:59,499
- ISN'T THAT WHAT MAKES 
IT FUNNY?

408
00:15:59,499 --> 00:16:01,001
I'M LAUGHING.

409
00:16:01,001 --> 00:16:02,752
GO FISH--UNO--OKAY.

410
00:16:02,752 --> 00:16:04,004
I JUST NEED A DRINK.

411
00:16:04,004 --> 00:16:05,672
- WELL, I'M SORRY. 
IT'S JUST TOO LATE.

412
00:16:05,672 --> 00:16:07,967
I'M MOVING TO PHOENIX. 
I GOT A JOB.

413
00:16:11,386 --> 00:16:14,556
SOMETHING YOU APPLY FOR, 
AND THEN THEY PAY YOU TO, UH--

414
00:16:14,556 --> 00:16:16,225
NEVER MIND; I DON'T 
WANT TO RUIN THE SURPRISE.

415
00:16:16,225 --> 00:16:17,726
SO NO HARD FEELINGS.

416
00:16:17,726 --> 00:16:19,061
ADIOS. SAYONARA.

417
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:20,604
I'LL SEE YOU 
WHEN THE FIRST PARENT DIES.

418
00:16:20,604 --> 00:16:22,439
WELL, I'D RATHER BE DEAD 
IN CALIFORNIA

419
00:16:22,439 --> 00:16:23,983
THAN ALIVE IN ARIZONA.

420
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:25,025
[laughter]

421
00:16:25,025 --> 00:16:26,735
- TOUCHE. 
- GEORGE MICHAEL, GRAB THE COAT.

422
00:16:26,735 --> 00:16:29,363
- I THINK DAD WOULD REALLY 
WANT YOU TO HELP US OUT HERE.

423
00:16:29,363 --> 00:16:30,905
- DAD'S IN JAIL. 
HERE WE GO.

424
00:16:30,905 --> 00:16:33,783
- WELL, THE LEAST YOU COULD DO 
IS SAY GOOD-BYE TO HIM.

425
00:16:33,783 --> 00:16:36,578
narrator: 
IN FACT, MICHAEL HAD NOT SPOKEN

426
00:16:36,578 --> 00:16:38,913
TO HIS FATHER SINCE THE ARREST,

427
00:16:38,913 --> 00:16:40,915
AND HE DECIDED TO GIVE 
HIS FATHER THE COURTESY

428
00:16:40,915 --> 00:16:42,876
OF A FORMAL RESIGNATION.

429
00:16:42,876 --> 00:16:44,003
- I QUIT.

430
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:47,006
- PROBABLY A GOOD CAREER MOVE.

431
00:16:49,591 --> 00:16:52,927
- YOU KNOW, I PARKED IN THE SAME 
SPOT FOR THE LAST FIVE YEARS.

432
00:16:52,927 --> 00:16:54,679
I WAS THERE ON TIME 
EVERY SINGLE DAY.

433
00:16:54,679 --> 00:16:55,722
- MIKE-- 
- I WAS SO LOYAL.

434
00:16:55,722 --> 00:16:57,016
I WORKED SO HARD.

435
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:58,267
WHY DIDN'T YOU JUST 
PUT ME IN CHARGE?

436
00:16:58,267 --> 00:16:59,768
- MICHAEL, LISTEN TO ME.

437
00:16:59,768 --> 00:17:01,770
THESE GUYS, THE S.E.C., 
THEY'VE BEEN AFTER ME FOR YEARS.

438
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:03,147
I PUT YOU IN CHARGE, 
YOU'RE GONNA BE WEARING

439
00:17:03,147 --> 00:17:04,439
ONE OF THESE JUMPSUITS TOO.

440
00:17:04,439 --> 00:17:07,234
- I COULD'VE HELPED-- 
- YOU'D BE AN ACCOMPLICE.

441
00:17:07,234 --> 00:17:10,362
NO. 
IT HAD TO BE YOUR MOM.

442
00:17:14,116 --> 00:17:17,577
THEY CANNOT ARREST 
A HUSBAND AND WIFE

443
00:17:17,577 --> 00:17:22,374
FOR THE SAME CRIME.

444
00:17:22,374 --> 00:17:25,794
- YEAH, I DON'T THINK 
THAT THAT'S TRUE, DAD.

445
00:17:25,794 --> 00:17:26,878
- REALLY?

446
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:34,594
I GOT THE WORST 
[bleep] ATTORNEYS.

447
00:17:34,594 --> 00:17:35,679
narrator: 
WITH MICHAEL LEAVING TOWN,

448
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:37,556
LINDSAY DECIDED 
TO TAKE INVENTORY

449
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:40,059
OF THE FAMILY'S 
LAST REMAINING ASSET:

450
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:44,188
THEIR MODEL HOME.

451
00:17:44,188 --> 00:17:45,272
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

452
00:17:45,272 --> 00:17:46,731
- PACKING UP. 
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

453
00:17:46,731 --> 00:17:50,902
- WELL, 
JUST LOOKING FOR...YOU...

454
00:17:50,902 --> 00:17:52,779
TO SAY GOOD-BYE TO YOU.

455
00:17:52,779 --> 00:17:53,905
- GONNA MISS YOU GUYS.

456
00:17:53,905 --> 00:17:58,452
- OH, WELL, WE'LL COME OUT 
AND SEE YOU IN--

457
00:17:58,452 --> 00:18:00,704
YEAH, 
WE'LL MISS YOU TOO.

458
00:18:00,704 --> 00:18:02,664
- IT'S BEEN NICE 
HAVING YOU GUYS AROUND--

459
00:18:02,664 --> 00:18:04,999
YOU KNOW, TO TALK TO.

460
00:18:04,999 --> 00:18:08,212
WELL, SINCE MOM DIED, 
IT'S BEEN KIND OF LONELY, AND--

461
00:18:08,212 --> 00:18:12,966
I JUST WISH 
WE COULD ALL STAY HERE.

462
00:18:12,966 --> 00:18:15,302
- I--I NEED A HAND 
WITH THE VAN, PLEASE.

463
00:18:15,302 --> 00:18:16,886
- OKAY. 
- SORRY.

464
00:18:37,199 --> 00:18:39,451
- WELL, I GUESS HE 
REALLY MISSES HIS FAMILY.

465
00:18:39,451 --> 00:18:41,120
- WELL, HE DOESN'T KNOW US 
VERY WELL.

466
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,455
- YEAH, CLEARLY.

467
00:18:43,455 --> 00:18:44,998
LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION.

468
00:18:44,998 --> 00:18:47,251
WHERE THE HELL HAVE YOU BEEN? 
WHY DIDN'T YOU CALL ME?

469
00:18:47,251 --> 00:18:49,461
- LOOK AT MY LIFE, MICHAEL.

470
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:52,547
TOBIAS IS OUT OF WORK. 
WE'RE IN DEBT.

471
00:18:52,547 --> 00:18:55,550
IT'S...

472
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:01,598
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING? 
ARE YOU TRYING TO CRY?

473
00:19:01,598 --> 00:19:04,559
- I'M SAD. 
LIFE IS HARD RIGHT NOW.

474
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:06,353
I'VE GOT THE J.D.L. ON MY ASS.

475
00:19:06,353 --> 00:19:08,272
- J.D.L.?

476
00:19:08,272 --> 00:19:09,898
- JEWISH DEFENSE LEAGUE.

477
00:19:09,898 --> 00:19:11,275
- OH, THE CIRCUMCISION THING?

478
00:19:11,275 --> 00:19:12,734
THIS IS WHY I WAS AGAINST HOOP.

479
00:19:12,734 --> 00:19:14,611
WHY DIDN'T YOU JUST 
MIND YOUR OWN BUSINESS?

480
00:19:14,611 --> 00:19:16,070
- THIS IS WHY I DIDN'T CALL YOU, 
MICHAEL,

481
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:18,031
BECAUSE YOU'RE SO JUDGMENTAL.

482
00:19:18,031 --> 00:19:19,241
- NO, I'M NOT JUDGMENTAL.

483
00:19:19,241 --> 00:19:20,909
- AND YOU'RE DISAPPOINTED IN ME.

484
00:19:20,909 --> 00:19:22,494
- I'M NOT DISAPPOINTED IN YOU.

485
00:19:22,494 --> 00:19:23,995
- YOU ARE.

486
00:19:23,995 --> 00:19:25,372
- SO I'M DISAPPOINTED IN YOU.

487
00:19:25,372 --> 00:19:27,582
BUT COME ON. WHAT IS NOT 
DISAPPOINTING ABOUT MY LIFE?

488
00:19:27,582 --> 00:19:28,875
DAD DIDN'T GIVE ME 
THE PROMOTION.

489
00:19:28,875 --> 00:19:30,252
DAD'S IN JAIL.

490
00:19:30,252 --> 00:19:31,461
HOW DISAPPOINTING IS THAT?

491
00:19:31,461 --> 00:19:32,837
- SO WE'RE 
A DISAPPOINTING FAMILY.

492
00:19:32,837 --> 00:19:35,590
- WE'RE AN INCREDIBLY 
DISAPPOINTING FAMILY.

493
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:39,803
BUT WE ARE A FAMILY, 
AND I WANT MY SON TO BE HAPPY.

494
00:19:39,803 --> 00:19:44,599
SO MAYBE WE SHOULD BE 
IN EACH OTHER'S LIVES.

495
00:19:44,599 --> 00:19:46,560
- I'D LIKE THAT.

496
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:51,022
- YEAH?

497
00:19:51,022 --> 00:19:52,566
SERIOUSLY, 
YOU'RE GONNA PULL A MUSCLE.

498
00:19:52,566 --> 00:19:54,234
- I USED TO BE ABLE TO DO THIS.

499
00:19:54,234 --> 00:19:56,528
narrator: SO MICHAEL DECIDED 
TO STAY IN CALIFORNIA

500
00:19:56,528 --> 00:19:58,322

THE FAMILY BUSINESS.

00:19:58,322 --> 00:19:59,906
AND FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER,

502
00:19:59,906 --> 00:20:02,534
HE GATHERED HIS FAMILY TOGETHER 
IN THE MODEL HOME.

504
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:05,329

00:20:44,826 --> 00:20:46,661
I MEAN, YOU DON'T EVEN 
HAVE ANY REFERENCES.

523
00:20:49,456 --> 00:20:51,625

OF A REFERENCE FOR YOU?

524
