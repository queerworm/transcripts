<i>George Michael was trying</i>

5
00:00:24,149 --> 00:00:25,150
Excuse me. Hello.

6
00:00:25,316 --> 00:00:28,695
[narrator] <i>By bragging about software</i>

7
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:31,531
So it's privacy software
that's also anti-piracy?

8
00:00:31,614 --> 00:00:33,074
It's called Fakeblock.

9
00:00:33,158 --> 00:00:35,201
[narrator] <i>He was lying. It was software</i>

10
00:00:35,285 --> 00:00:38,747
<i>that made a phone, when tapped,</i>
<i>sound like a woodblock,</i>

11
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:41,499
<i>which it kind of does,</i>
<i>even without the software.</i>

12
00:00:41,583 --> 00:00:46,004
<i>And soon, he escorted her</i>
<i>to an awards show for young Hollywood,</i>

13

-Wow!
-You grow up very quickly in Spain.

16

My God, I know this guy. Hey, man.

17
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:58,600
He's nobody.

[narrator]
<i>Although he made some rookie mistakes...</i>

19

He's "Justin" from

20
00:01:03,438 --> 00:01:04,981
It's on a lot in Spain.

21

[narrator]
<i>He soon got himself back into</i>

26
00:01:15,658 --> 00:01:18,495
<i>with a random act</i>
<i>of senseless non-violence</i>

27
00:01:18,578 --> 00:01:21,581

<i>with this man,</i>

33
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:37,430
<i>whom she had no idea was the man</i>

Are you trying to find out where I live?

35
00:01:38,723 --> 00:01:40,767
And your favorite kind of jewelry.

36
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:44,062
[narrator] <i>It was the mention</i>

37

<i>from her role as Marky's accessory.</i>

38
00:01:47,023 --> 00:01:49,692

42

Yes. Your privacy software.

00:01:59,869 --> 00:02:02,288
[narrator] <i>Which was why he was reticent</i>

[narrator]
<i>When he saw how others were impressed,</i>

46
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:07,585

{\an8}I wanted to impress Maeby,

{\an8}so I told her that I created
this privacy software.

90

{\an8}Why would you do that?

91
00:04:02,033 --> 00:04:03,826
{\an8}You know, it's like the time
you told that girl

{\an8}that you were George Takei's son.

93
00:04:06,037 --> 00:04:07,914

This thing's taking off.

{\an8}They're saying Fakeblock
knocked out Schnoodle.

{\an8}That was a coincidence.

96
00:04:11,709 --> 00:04:12,961
It must have been a power surge.

At least get our five grand back.

{\an8}Well, I put in the five grand,
you put in $3.

{\an8}You may have put in the most money
to Fakeblock,

{\an8}No, you're the hop-on, Paul,

163
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:32,183
I will.<i> </i>[laughing]

164
00:06:33,684 --> 00:06:34,560
I will.

165
00:06:36,854 --> 00:06:38,648
[narrator]
<i>That's when George Michael got the call</i>

166
00:06:38,731 --> 00:06:39,774
<i>from his Uncle Gob...</i>

167
00:06:39,857 --> 00:06:41,401
I need to see you tonight.

168
00:06:41,484 --> 00:06:44,695
[narrator] <i>Which he was doing as a favor</i>
<i>for George Michael's father...</i>

169
00:06:45,196 --> 00:06:46,656
<i>who had fallen for an actress.</i>

170
00:06:46,739 --> 00:06:48,699
-Is it Julie Bowen?
-No, it's not.

171
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:50,368
-Is yours Julie Bowen?
-Is yours Julie...

172
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:52,954
Michael, you're seeing Julie Bowen?

173
00:06:53,037 --> 00:06:54,414
I am not seeing Julie Bowen,

174
00:06:54,497 --> 00:06:56,541
but if you are, you tell me right now.

175
00:06:56,624 --> 00:06:57,834
I want to hear you say the words,

176
00:06:57,917 --> 00:06:59,168
"I'm not seeing Julie Bowen."

177
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:00,962
I have not seen Julie Bowen.

178
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:02,755
Well, that's a funny way to phrase it.

179
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,507
[narrator]
<i>This went on for some time.</i>

180
00:07:04,966 --> 00:07:06,843
<i>But eventually, Michael revealed</i>

181
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:09,512
<i>that she was interested in him</i>
<i>as a producer.</i>

182
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:11,639
<i>But without his son's life rights,</i>

183
00:07:11,722 --> 00:07:13,808
<i>the movie might not even happen...</i>

184
00:07:13,891 --> 00:07:15,893
...because I don't think that
I can ask my son.

185
00:07:15,977 --> 00:07:18,312
What happened between him and me
was very disappointing.

186
00:07:18,396 --> 00:07:19,689
Take him to the Ealing Club.

187
00:07:19,772 --> 00:07:20,690
It's all showbiz.

188
00:07:20,773 --> 00:07:22,191
I used to hang out there all the time.

189
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:23,609
It's just actresses
and stuff like that.

190
00:07:23,901 --> 00:07:26,237
I don't know if I could pick up the phone
and call him and ask him...

191
00:07:27,029 --> 00:07:29,157
It's about your father and you.

192
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,659
Really, is he upset?

193
00:07:31,742 --> 00:07:33,119
<i>Do I seem like a clown to you?</i>

194
00:07:33,369 --> 00:07:35,705
<i>Do I seem like some kind</i>
<i>of a clown to you?</i>

195
00:07:36,164 --> 00:07:38,666
[narrator] <i>George Michael was nervous,</i>
<i>and he didn't even know</i>

196
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:40,751
<i>that this was about to happen...</i>

197
00:07:40,835 --> 00:07:42,462
...your hot, little, tight little, hot ass

198
00:07:42,587 --> 00:07:44,005
right up there right away to see him.

199
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:45,298
[narrator] <i>Or this...</i>

200
00:07:46,424 --> 00:07:48,885
Ow! Bit my tongue, you little bitch.

201
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:50,052
[man] But are we good?

202
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:50,970
We're good.

203
00:07:51,679 --> 00:07:52,513
Okay.

204
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:54,474
-[narrator] <i>Maeby was nervous, too,</i>
-[knock on door]

205
00:07:54,557 --> 00:07:58,603
<i>because she still had to trick her mother</i>
<i>into turning a trick.</i>

206
00:07:58,686 --> 00:07:59,770
Hi, sweetie.

207
00:07:59,854 --> 00:08:02,023
Hey. Hi.

208
00:08:02,106 --> 00:08:04,275
{\an8}[narrator] <i>But the universe seemed</i>
<i>to like the plan.</i>

209
00:08:04,609 --> 00:08:06,777
Yeah, well,
the bags are certainly a surprise.

210
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:08,154
You're not thinking of moving in, are you?

211
00:08:08,237 --> 00:08:10,198
-What? No.
-Yeah, because

212
00:08:10,281 --> 00:08:11,741
I don't think Dad would be cool with it.

213
00:08:11,824 --> 00:08:12,909
No, of course not.

214
00:08:13,701 --> 00:08:15,870
-Is he in?
-No.

215
00:08:16,662 --> 00:08:18,206
Oh. What happened there?

216
00:08:19,081 --> 00:08:21,959
Kids or people who like kids.

217
00:08:22,084 --> 00:08:23,878
So, where's Marky?

218
00:08:23,961 --> 00:08:26,422
God, Marky will be in jail
for quite a while.

219
00:08:27,131 --> 00:08:29,800
{\an8}So it turns out the glitter
was shrapnel grade.

220
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:33,095
They're upping my charges
from prank bomb

221
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:34,555
to non-Arab terrorism.

222
00:08:35,306 --> 00:08:36,849
This is where you letting me out
of the podium

223
00:08:36,933 --> 00:08:37,767
would have really helped.

224
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:39,227
Why didn't you just come out?

225
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:41,103
I couldn't do it, someone locked me in.

226
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:43,564
I need you to bail me out.
I need you to use that check.

227
00:08:43,648 --> 00:08:45,483
Oh, I don't have that check anymore.

228
00:08:45,608 --> 00:08:47,235
-What?
-You told me to rip it up.

229
00:08:47,318 --> 00:08:48,736
I thought you said
you didn't believe in money.

230
00:08:48,819 --> 00:08:50,821
I didn't until I realized
what it could keep me from.

231
00:08:51,072 --> 00:08:52,365
Jail's a lot like Swappigan's,

232
00:08:52,448 --> 00:08:53,783
except there's only one thing to swap.

233
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:55,034
It's scary.

234
00:08:55,326 --> 00:08:57,286
-Anus tart.
-Yep, that's me.

235
00:08:58,079 --> 00:08:59,455
God, that could've been me.

236
00:08:59,622 --> 00:09:00,915
Lindsay, listen to me, I'm scared.

237
00:09:00,998 --> 00:09:02,083
I'm scared, I'm scared...

238
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:04,085
-I'm really scared.
-[man] No touching!

239
00:09:04,168 --> 00:09:06,128
Actually, it's kind of nice
to have a little me time.

240
00:09:06,504 --> 00:09:09,465
Oh, of course, that's why
you were giving Herbert Love

241
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:11,008
a little "you time" last night.

242
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:13,844
You were flirting with him
to get Marky out of jail.

243
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:16,264
Well, yeah, that is what
I should have been do--

244
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:19,350
-What I... did, yeah, yeah.
-Mm-hmm.

245
00:09:19,433 --> 00:09:21,894
That's exactly what I should have
and did do.

246
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:24,605
And it's not that bad an idea, actually.

247
00:09:25,189 --> 00:09:26,440
You can get him to do anything.

248
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:28,693
He's probably one of those shallow guys
who's only interested in looks.

249
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:29,860
I miss that.

250
00:09:30,194 --> 00:09:31,654
Missed that.

251
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:33,823
Yeah, you know, maybe it
would be a good idea

252
00:09:33,906 --> 00:09:35,241
if I got in touch with him.

253
00:09:35,324 --> 00:09:37,493
I mean, he did give me his card.

254
00:09:38,369 --> 00:09:40,413
Although, I could never call him.

255
00:09:40,496 --> 00:09:42,373
I could call him for you

256
00:09:42,456 --> 00:09:43,583
Set up a meeting.

257
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:46,294
You could even wear that wig,
so nobody would think you're selling out.

258
00:09:46,377 --> 00:09:48,754
-Yeah.
-And I'll tell him it has to be tonight.

259
00:09:48,838 --> 00:09:50,673
Well, the sooner the better.

260
00:09:50,756 --> 00:09:51,924
Got to get Marky out of jail.

261
00:09:52,049 --> 00:09:54,176
That's why the sooner the better.

262
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:56,846
[narrator] <i>Technically, she still needed</i>
<i>to talk her mother</i>

263
00:09:56,929 --> 00:09:58,306
<i>into having sex with him.</i>

264
00:09:58,389 --> 00:10:02,518
<i>But this was a woman who once wore this</i>
<i>to a men's prison.</i>

265
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:04,437
<i>So she felt she'd be okay.</i>

266
00:10:08,232 --> 00:10:09,942
<i>Maeby arranged</i> <i>for her mother</i>

267
00:10:10,026 --> 00:10:12,612
<i>to meet Herbert Love at a showbiz club</i>

268
00:10:12,695 --> 00:10:14,363
<i>-that she was a member of.</i>
-No cameras...

269
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:15,615
No phones...

270
00:10:15,698 --> 00:10:17,867
Thank you for being willing to meet.

271
00:10:17,992 --> 00:10:19,493
Meet, greet.

272
00:10:19,577 --> 00:10:21,037
Sure are sweet.

273
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,371
What did the lamb say?

274
00:10:22,747 --> 00:10:24,290
-Bah?
-Bleat. [laughing]

275
00:10:24,373 --> 00:10:25,583
Yes, of course.

276
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:29,170
I was just wondering,
is anything really bad gonna happen

277
00:10:29,253 --> 00:10:31,255
to that blue guy from the rally?

278
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:32,506
Do you want to press charges?

279
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:34,342
Who can think of Little Boy Blue,

280
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:36,594
when I've got this beautiful face
in front of me?

281
00:10:36,677 --> 00:10:39,305
Oh. Thanks.
Haven't heard that in a long time.

282
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:42,350
Your cheekbones are even higher
than my approval rating.

283
00:10:42,433 --> 00:10:44,810
Your brain can register
my cheekbones?

284
00:10:44,894 --> 00:10:46,437
I'll register them to vote.

285
00:10:46,812 --> 00:10:48,856
Your lips are like a Murphy bed.

286
00:10:48,939 --> 00:10:51,734
They don't take up much space,
but they are there when you need them.

287
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:54,153
You're wonderful.

288
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:58,949
But I do want to talk to you
about a couple of issues.

289
00:10:59,033 --> 00:11:02,828
Can we just have one night
where we don't talk about politics?

290
00:11:03,371 --> 00:11:06,207
Yes, yes, just one night.

291
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:08,042
-We deserve it.
-Let's get a room.

292
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:09,960
Yes. No. What?

293
00:11:11,629 --> 00:11:12,463
Okay.

294
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:14,924
We can talk in a room, I guess.

295
00:11:18,427 --> 00:11:19,887
You hang tight.

296
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:22,682
I'm gonna meet with some
of my "constititutes."

297
00:11:23,808 --> 00:11:25,184
-Hello.
-[Lindsay] Michael?

298
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:26,352
Hi.

299
00:11:26,727 --> 00:11:27,895
-How are you?
-I'm good.

300
00:11:27,978 --> 00:11:29,397
I almost didn't recognize you.

301
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,273
-It's my hair.
-That's some of it,

302
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:33,150
but it's also, you're with a guy

303
00:11:33,234 --> 00:11:35,361
that pretty much represents everything
you pretend to hate.

304
00:11:35,444 --> 00:11:36,529
Was that Herbert Love?

305
00:11:36,612 --> 00:11:38,239
Now I remember
why we fell out of touch.

306
00:11:38,322 --> 00:11:40,324
No, I'm kidding. I'm so sorry.

307
00:11:40,449 --> 00:11:42,493
[narrator]
<i>And that's when Michael found a way</i>

308
00:11:42,576 --> 00:11:44,954
<i>to deliver on a promise to his father.</i>

309
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:47,665
But if you really want
to blow him... away,

310
00:11:47,748 --> 00:11:51,419
you know the wall issue
that everyone is talking about?

311
00:11:51,502 --> 00:11:53,254
The wall between Mexico and the US?

312
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:54,714
Tell him to take it down?

313
00:11:54,797 --> 00:11:57,174
Or just not to put it up.
No wall yet.

314
00:11:57,258 --> 00:11:58,217
Oh, no, there's no...

315
00:11:58,300 --> 00:11:59,301
I knew that, yeah.

316
00:11:59,427 --> 00:12:01,846
If you could get him against the wall,

317
00:12:02,179 --> 00:12:03,180
Lindsay...

318
00:12:04,098 --> 00:12:06,308
-Yeah, sure, fine.
-Yeah?

319
00:12:06,434 --> 00:12:08,310
Yeah, I'll talk to him
about the wall.

320
00:12:08,644 --> 00:12:10,688
-Good.
-I want to change politics.

321
00:12:10,771 --> 00:12:12,940
-Great.
-What's in it for me?

322
00:12:13,774 --> 00:12:15,401
So not completely change them?

323
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:16,902
What do you want?

324
00:12:16,986 --> 00:12:20,698
I want you to talk to that warden guy
about getting my boyfriend out,

325
00:12:20,823 --> 00:12:23,117
because I really don't think Herbert's
gonna help with that.

326
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:25,661
Well, I have a script notes call with him
on Tuesday.

327
00:12:27,163 --> 00:12:28,831
-Yeah, I'll talk to Warden Gentles.
-Great!

328
00:12:28,914 --> 00:12:29,957
-Thank you.
-This is good.

329
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,333
I'm glad we ran into each other.

330
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:33,210
If you do something for me.

331
00:12:33,294 --> 00:12:34,587
I'm making this movie...

332
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:36,338
and I need everybody's rights.

333
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:39,717
[narrator] <i>And that's how Lindsay agreed</i>
<i>to give Michael her rights</i>

334
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,343
<i>-for his movie.</i>
-Thanks.

335
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:44,472
-That's it.
<i>-But it shouldn't have been,</i>

336
00:12:44,555 --> 00:12:46,390
<i>because he should have asked for help</i>

337
00:12:46,474 --> 00:12:50,478
<i>getting into a club he was about</i>
<i>to discover</i> <i>was members only.</i>

338
00:12:50,561 --> 00:12:52,480
I'm meeting my son up there.
Maybe he's already up there.

339
00:12:52,563 --> 00:12:53,647
Could you maybe
page him up there?

340
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:55,107
I'm not getting any response.

341
00:12:55,191 --> 00:12:57,151
[narrator]
<i>And when the page proved fruitless...</i>

342
00:12:57,234 --> 00:13:00,446
You're gonna make me look like
a big shot in front of my son. Thank you.

343
00:13:00,529 --> 00:13:02,948
[narrator] <i>Michael decided</i>
<i>to head George Michael off</i>

344
00:13:03,032 --> 00:13:06,994
<i>before he could get to the club's lobby</i>
<i>with a small lie...</i>

345
00:13:07,077 --> 00:13:08,412
Hey, buddy, it's Dad.

346
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:11,999
I am having real trouble
getting up there.

347
00:13:12,124 --> 00:13:14,627
This traffic is unbelievable.

348
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:16,921
[narrator]
<i>Which led to a slightly bigger lie.</i>

349
00:13:17,004 --> 00:13:19,715
We got a light aircraft right
in the middle of the freeway.

350
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:22,384
[narrator] <i>And then some effort</i>
<i>to make it foolproof.</i>

351
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:24,470
And the kicker is that
there's no news crew.

352
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:27,473
I mean, I guess they can't get in either
'cause of the traffic,

353
00:13:27,598 --> 00:13:29,266
so no one's gonna be able to see this.

354
00:13:29,892 --> 00:13:32,520
[narrator] <i>But perhaps,</i>
<i>had Michael not have lied,</i>

355
00:13:32,603 --> 00:13:34,939
<i>he wouldn't have</i>
<i>felt suspicious when, moments later,</i>

356
00:13:35,022 --> 00:13:37,566
{\an8}<i>he received a return call</i>

357

358

359

[George Michael] <i>Oh, God, they're forcing</i>

360

361

363
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:55,042
He looks just like me.

364
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:56,794
I'll just go up, I'll find him, I'll...

365
00:13:57,837 --> 00:13:59,380
-Come on.
-Hey, Donnie!

366
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:01,173
Hey, I had you for a semester at Openings.

367
00:14:01,257 --> 00:14:02,800
Yeah, okay, all right.

368
00:14:02,883 --> 00:14:04,593
Hey, come on. I'm his guest.

369
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:05,845
Is this man your guest?

370
00:14:05,928 --> 00:14:07,555
No, no. I'm just
meeting my dad here.

371
00:14:07,638 --> 00:14:09,306
Oh, screw this. I'm going in.

372
00:14:09,431 --> 00:14:11,058
Go on up, go on.

373
00:14:11,141 --> 00:14:15,563
Oh, come on!
Some Openings child you are, man!

374
00:14:15,646 --> 00:14:17,648
[narrator]
<i>And George Michael girded himself</i>

375
00:14:17,731 --> 00:14:21,193
<i>for his first meeting with his father</i>
<i>since he voted him out of the dorm.</i>

376
00:14:21,277 --> 00:14:24,196
Hi. Just a sea-breeze, please.
Make it a strong one.

377
00:14:24,905 --> 00:14:26,073
Put some stank on that.

378
00:14:26,323 --> 00:14:27,283
George?

379
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:30,160
George Maharis?

380
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:32,413
<i>And that's when he heard the name</i>
<i>he'd forgotten</i>

381
00:14:32,496 --> 00:14:33,706
<i>he'd given out as his own.</i>

382
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:37,418
I see you.

383
00:14:38,002 --> 00:14:40,170
Rebel Alley?
We spoke three days ago.

384
00:14:40,296 --> 00:14:42,631
I know, I know. I remember.

385
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:44,800
-Are you a member here?
-No, I'm not.

386
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:47,052
No, I just walked in
past the big black security guard.

387
00:14:49,471 --> 00:14:50,431
Okay, you know what?

388
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:52,808
I was trying to be nice,
but you're just a jerk.

389
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:54,894
You're a bigger jerk
than Andy Richter over there!

390
00:14:54,977 --> 00:14:57,229
Loosen up, bitch.
I'm Andy Richter!

391
00:14:57,688 --> 00:15:01,317
I probably make, like,
$8,000 a day or something.

392
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,694
Hey, I'm sorry.

393
00:15:05,112 --> 00:15:07,573
I'm in the middle of a whole thing
with my dad right now,

394
00:15:07,656 --> 00:15:09,241
and I didn't mean to be...

395
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:10,784
however I just came off.

396
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:11,994
Badly.

397
00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:15,039
Well, I'm sorry. I've never met
a beautiful actress before.

398
00:15:15,122 --> 00:15:16,790
Oh. So you do know who I am?

399
00:15:16,874 --> 00:15:18,167
God, of course I know who you are!

400
00:15:18,292 --> 00:15:20,252
You were in the remake
of <i>Dangerous Cousins.</i>

401
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:22,880
I signed up to Netflix because
of that movie.

402
00:15:23,005 --> 00:15:26,383
I think I was just thrown that you were
interested in who I am.

403
00:15:26,467 --> 00:15:28,093
Well, you are George Maharis.

404
00:15:28,177 --> 00:15:30,220
Everyone's talking about
your software company.

405
00:15:31,055 --> 00:15:33,474
I'm sure women are just throwing
themselves at your feet.

406
00:15:33,974 --> 00:15:37,436
Well, you know, I prefer a woman
who aims higher.

407
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:38,979
[laughing]

408
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:42,733
-That was funny.
-Yeah, I know.

409
00:15:42,816 --> 00:15:44,610
That was good. That was, like, smooth.

410
00:15:44,693 --> 00:15:46,320
We have the same taste in words.

411
00:15:46,528 --> 00:15:47,988
Okay, should we get a drink?

412
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:49,281
I'm buying.

413
00:15:49,573 --> 00:15:51,325
I don't want you to think
I'm after you for your money.

Would you excuse me?

423

I'm just gonna use the men's room.

[narrator]
<i>And while checking his messages,</i>

<i>Maybe that's better.</i>

438

Gonna hang up now.

448
00:16:56,432 --> 00:16:58,976
I'm gonna video this
and send it in to the news.

00:16:59,059 --> 00:17:00,394
{\an8}Glad you're getting some footage of this,

450

a good angle myself.

451

God, I just hope there are no kids
on that plane.

457

-[phone chimes]
-Well, I tell you what.

459
00:17:18,954 --> 00:17:20,622
I feel worse for the parents, okay?

460
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:22,249
Probably, the kids thought

461
00:17:22,332 --> 00:17:24,668
that they could fly the plane all
by themselves.

462
00:17:24,752 --> 00:17:28,005
Bet you 500 bucks, they find a dead kid
behind the stick.

463
00:17:28,088 --> 00:17:30,257
Or maybe on the dead dad's lap

464
00:17:30,382 --> 00:17:32,051
whose only fault was

465
00:17:32,134 --> 00:17:34,219
loving that kid too much
and letting him fly the plane.

466
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:36,805
Next thing he knows, he's bouncing
off the top of the Sports Chalet

onto the express lane of the 605.

468

Bet you 500 bucks.

469
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:42,352
<i>One more thing, I think I accidentally</i>
<i>had the phone flipped around.</i>

<i>But, you know,</i>

479
00:18:00,162 --> 00:18:01,538

480

<i>with a paramedic named Tim Ridgley...</i>

481
00:18:03,957 --> 00:18:04,917

-No cameras allowed.
-No camera-- They're being real...

483
00:18:07,544 --> 00:18:10,047
[narrator] <i>But George Michael was proving</i>
<i>more adept at lying</i>

00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:12,633

-Hey.

490

Sorry, that was my dad.

491
00:18:23,852 --> 00:18:25,771
He can be kind of hard
to get off the phone sometimes.

492
00:18:26,396 --> 00:18:27,815
Tell me about it.
At least he wasn't drunk

493

and bitching about Don Ameche

494

If anything, I've been kind of
a lousy son lately,

497
00:18:35,572 --> 00:18:37,032
but, you know, it's just...

498
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:39,451
I mean, at some point,
I've got to start living my life.

499
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:43,288
[narrator] <i>Michael was hurt</i>
<i>and ready to do the same,</i>

500
00:18:43,372 --> 00:18:46,708
<i>when on his way out,</i>
<i>he heard something that cheered him up.</i>

501
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:48,377
[man] The guy that was harassing Rebel,
he's on his way down.

502
00:18:49,169 --> 00:18:50,129
Did you say Rebel?

503
00:18:50,879 --> 00:18:54,174
Hey, Andy Richter.
Michael Bluth. How you doing, Andy?

504
00:18:54,258 --> 00:18:55,843
Yeah. I'm Andy.

505
00:18:56,009 --> 00:18:56,844
I know him.

506
00:18:56,927 --> 00:18:58,512
Can I get on your membership,

507
00:18:58,637 --> 00:19:00,389
-and can you vouch for me?
-Oh, yeah, sure.

508
00:19:00,472 --> 00:19:02,266
Whatever you want, it's on Andy.

509
00:19:02,349 --> 00:19:04,143
-Thank you.
-It's on this rich [bleeps] hole.

510
00:19:04,351 --> 00:19:05,352
Bye.

511
00:19:09,731 --> 00:19:11,942
[narrator] <i>Lindsay was</i>
<i>in Herbert Love's hotel room...</i>

512
00:19:12,568 --> 00:19:15,612
<i>worrying she was too quickly</i>
<i>abandoning her principles.</i>

513
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:19,658
I can't do this, unless you promise
to be against the wall.

514
00:19:19,783 --> 00:19:21,034
What the hell?

515
00:19:22,286 --> 00:19:23,620
It's better for my back anyway.

516
00:19:23,704 --> 00:19:25,664
Thank you. Thank you.

517
00:19:25,789 --> 00:19:28,709
[narrator] <i>Although, technically,</i>
<i>that was one of Michael's principles.</i>

518
00:19:28,792 --> 00:19:31,128
{\an8}That was so not quick.

519
00:19:31,628 --> 00:19:32,504
Well, I paid for six hours.

520
00:19:32,588 --> 00:19:33,881
I want to get my money's worth.

521
00:19:33,964 --> 00:19:37,342
Imagine what would have happened
if you had the room for the whole night.

522
00:19:37,426 --> 00:19:38,760
I got it for the whole month.

523
00:19:38,886 --> 00:19:40,762
You crack me up.

524
00:19:41,346 --> 00:19:43,307
God, can you believe
this is happening?

525
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:46,310
I mean, we're such opposites,
and yet we're so in sync.

526
00:19:46,393 --> 00:19:48,228
-It's like we finish each other's...
-Sandwiches?

527
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:50,731
What's the point of raising funds
if I'm eating sandwiches?

528
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:53,150
I got something for you.

529
00:19:53,942 --> 00:19:54,818
Really?

530
00:19:55,694 --> 00:19:57,988
[gasps, sighs]

531
00:19:58,071 --> 00:20:01,783
This way, you'll always have a little
love near your heart.

532
00:20:03,327 --> 00:20:05,746
When love is near,
your heart will be happy.

533
00:20:06,413 --> 00:20:07,331
[gasps]

534
00:20:08,832 --> 00:20:10,751
-Ow! Jesus Christ!
-I'm sorry.

535
00:20:10,834 --> 00:20:12,669
-Why would you do that?
-I thought it was cute.

536
00:20:12,794 --> 00:20:14,046
-I saw it in a movie. Okay?
-Okay, thank you.

537
00:20:14,129 --> 00:20:15,589
Oh, I feel so special.

538
00:20:15,672 --> 00:20:17,007
You are special.

539
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:19,384
[narrator] <i>Of course, he actually thought</i>
<i>she was a whore...</i>

540
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:22,054
<i>but he had gotten the necklace on special.</i>

541
00:20:22,137 --> 00:20:23,847
<i>And now, finally in the Ealing Club,</i>

542
00:20:23,931 --> 00:20:25,974
<i>Michael didn't find Rebel,</i>

543
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:28,936
<i>but he did run into the man</i>
<i>he believed to be her lover.</i>

544
00:20:29,019 --> 00:20:30,479
-Ron.
-Thank you.

545
00:20:30,687 --> 00:20:31,730
No, no,  it's Michael.

546
00:20:32,314 --> 00:20:34,983
Michael Bluth, doing the film
about my family and...

547
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:37,152
Yeah, when are we gonna
get your kid's signature, though?

548
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:38,320
I'm working on it.

549
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:41,114
I got a hold of him,
and we're gonna meet here tonight,

550
00:20:41,198 --> 00:20:42,616
but I think that he's blowing me off.

551
00:20:42,699 --> 00:20:45,077
Well, kids will be kids, right?

552
00:20:45,202 --> 00:20:46,620
You know a month ago...

553
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:49,623
I would have told you he and I were
exactly the same, that we were twins.

554
00:20:49,748 --> 00:20:53,669
But now, I wouldn't even think of my son
as my brother.

555
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,255
You know, the thing is...

556
00:20:57,631 --> 00:20:58,840
He's busy.

00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:09,351
{\an8}[narrator] <i>On the next</i>

<i>Lindsay gets a job opportunity.</i>

560

The only way we can see each other

You are gonna be my key advisor.

562

I would like that very much.

[narrator] <i>She would be enacting</i>

She's gonna need a key to my room,

565

and I'll advise you to use it
when I call you.
