I don't want to embarrass anyone,

10
00:00:36,786 --> 00:00:38,830
so, everyone, close your eyes, close 'em.

11
00:00:39,372 --> 00:00:42,333
Now, if you passed the test,
go ahead and get up

12
00:00:42,417 --> 00:00:43,960
and exit the classroom.

13
00:00:44,669 --> 00:00:45,879
Does that include the crew?

14

No, the <i>Babies Having Babies</i> crew

-38.
-Oh, 43.

16
00:00:49,758 --> 00:00:51,176
That's because I'm good with num--

17

Oh, no, actually it's 34.

18
00:00:53,178 --> 00:00:56,681
If it's dumb to stay behind with you,
call me a dummy.

{\an8}-Also, can you buy me booze?
-Totally.

57
00:02:40,118 --> 00:02:43,580
[narrator] <i>But even more provocatively,</i>
<i>it was also a time during which</i>

No, I could see that argument,

164

You know what, I am done with this family.

165
00:07:10,555 --> 00:07:13,349
I hope you've saved some money
'cause you're gonna need every dime now.

166
00:07:13,724 --> 00:07:16,936
What’s this? Return it. Or rip it up.

167
00:07:17,019 --> 00:07:19,021
-Michael.
-Come on. Give it a rip.

168
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:21,816
Rip it up, right down the center.

169
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:30,616
That's it. Rip it.

170
00:07:31,075 --> 00:07:34,245
Couple more. Did you get it?

171
00:07:35,621 --> 00:07:36,456
Proud of you.

172
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:39,167
-Happy birthday.
-[Gob] Happy birthday, George Michael.

173
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:42,503
[narrator] <i>But don't worry,</i>

175
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:48,926
<i>And although he  would arrive</i>
<i>without his possessions,</i>

176
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:51,846

-[man] Hey, hey, check it out!

178
00:07:57,143 --> 00:08:00,688

180
00:08:05,568 --> 00:08:08,070
[George Michael] No. No, no.

181
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:10,656
What?

182
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:19,957
[narrator] <i>During his freshman year,</i>

184
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:27,131
So that's a breakfast combo with a Pepsi.

194

222
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:17,033
[narrator] <i>It seems Tobias and Lindsay</i>

<i>Marky and DeBrie, at what</i>

It's not important who it is.
It's Sue Storm!

235
00:10:50,733 --> 00:10:54,945
[narrator]<i> Tobias had made a similar swap</i>

[Lindsay] <i>Maeby, honey, Daddy has insisted</i>

240

[Tobias] <i>Maeby, your daddy's</i>

Excuse me, I swallowed a bug there.

Your daddy's not going

244
00:11:18,052 --> 00:11:20,971
[narrator] <i>So each of her parents thought</i>

<i>-which meant she had the house to herself.</i>

You're fired.

256
00:11:47,623 --> 00:11:48,708
[narrator] <i>She'd been replaced.</i>

257
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:49,709
Why?

258
00:11:49,792 --> 00:11:51,627
Because you don't have
a high school diploma,

259
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:54,964
and we have a very strict policy here,
that everyone has to have a diploma

260
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:57,174
on account of the fact
that Ron never graduated.

261
00:11:57,258 --> 00:11:59,093
-Is this really happening?
-Actually, I was thinking

262
00:11:59,176 --> 00:12:02,138
I wasn't gonna have to fire you

-[Maeby] How did they find out?
-Does it even matter anymore?

264
00:12:05,599 --> 00:12:06,475
I told them.

265
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:10,479
[narrator] <i>And so she decided to embark</i>

So that stuff's all going on

Nothing matters now!

-Why do you kiss like this?
-Like what?

328
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:09,158
The teeth!
They must not be used like this.

329
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:12,453
[narrator] <i>It was actually</i>
<i>a jaw and lip retraction issue,</i>

You make love like a boy!

Overpower me! Yes.

-You're a terrible mother!

<i>He was like a king returning</i>

345
00:16:01,001 --> 00:16:02,753
I feel like a king returning
to his castle.

346
00:16:02,836 --> 00:16:05,631
[narrator] <i>Only to discover that</i>
<i>they thought he was two kings.</i>

347

Welcome to your castle!

348
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:10,928
[narrator] <i>And they had doubled</i>

Double castle...

350

Can't wait to meet Michael, George.

[speaking Spanish]

353
00:16:27,069 --> 00:16:30,489
[narrator] <i>But George Michael's</i>

354
00:16:30,906 --> 00:16:32,908
-Dad.
-Pete died.

355
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:34,159
Oh.

356
00:16:35,953 --> 00:16:37,830
-Who's Pete?
-Don't worry about it.

357
00:16:38,956 --> 00:16:42,209
Don't you worry about it.
I like this! I like the mustache.

358
00:16:43,544 --> 00:16:45,212
-It's kind of fun.
-That's great.

359
00:16:45,295 --> 00:16:47,423
Probably gonna want to shave it off
before the start of next quarter,

360
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:49,049
or they're gonna think you're a musician.

361
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:50,592
[narrator] <i>And perhaps it was the fact</i>

362
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:53,804
<i>that she had never really</i>
<i>disappointed her parents,</i>

363
00:16:53,887 --> 00:16:55,389
<i>and they were getting older,</i>

364
00:16:55,556 --> 00:16:58,726
<i>or it was because of the lack of internet</i>
<i>at the model home.</i>

365
00:16:58,809 --> 00:17:00,686
That is it. This is like living in 1999.

366
00:17:01,145 --> 00:17:04,273
[narrator] <i>But that's when Maeby began</i>
<i>her final, or senior,</i>

367

<i>senior year of high school,</i>

368
00:17:05,899 --> 00:17:08,027
{\an8}<i>And it ultimately led to this.</i>

369
00:17:08,193 --> 00:17:10,571
But it's illegal, right?
Can't you go to jail?

370
00:17:10,654 --> 00:17:11,780
Only if you're caught.

371
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:15,534
So I'm still gonna stay in high school
till my parents notice me.

372
00:17:15,617 --> 00:17:18,662
You know, just, like, let them think,
"Oh, no, should we be worried?

373
00:17:18,746 --> 00:17:20,539
-Is she really that immature?"
-Yeah.

374
00:17:20,622 --> 00:17:23,834
Well, I mean, isn't it
kind of a little immature

375
00:17:23,917 --> 00:17:26,045
to try and make
your parents worry like that?

376
00:17:26,503 --> 00:17:28,547
That's good.
I'm gonna try and work that in there.

377
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:29,965
No, I think it's in there.

378
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:32,885
Yeah, well, let's get you in here before
our third roommate shows up.

379
00:17:32,968 --> 00:17:35,304
-That's Paul Haun.
-Hi. So there's three people in here?

380
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:37,264
Yeah, well, one guy
is just kind of crashing here.

381
00:17:37,681 --> 00:17:39,850
It can't be worse than living
with your dad.

382
00:17:40,392 --> 00:17:42,519
It's not. No, it's not worse than that.

383
00:17:43,187 --> 00:17:45,814
[narrator]
<i>And later, she was joined by her uncle.</i>

384
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:47,316
Didn't say it was your cousin.

385
00:17:47,691 --> 00:17:50,277
That's smart, let him think
there's a girl in here.

386
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:51,695
We were just complaining
about roommates.

387
00:17:52,529 --> 00:17:53,947
P-Hound.

388
00:17:54,615 --> 00:17:57,534
-I thought it was the other one.
-No, it was P-Hound, yeah.

389
00:17:57,659 --> 00:18:00,621
He's the worst. See, I think if
George Michael and I didn't have

390
00:18:00,704 --> 00:18:02,748
each other as roommates,
we'd be going crazy.

391
00:18:02,831 --> 00:18:06,502
[narrator] <i>And for a moment,</i>
<i>Maeby felt superior to her cousin--</i>

392
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:08,337
<i>And her uncle for that matter.</i>

393
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:10,631
Actually, have you told her
about your software?

394
00:18:10,964 --> 00:18:13,967
-No, software?
-He's got this privacy software.

395
00:18:14,051 --> 00:18:16,428
Keeps people from stealing your stuff.
Tell her, pal.

396
00:18:16,512 --> 00:18:18,263
[narrator]
<i>Maeby tried to hide her jealousy.</i>

397
00:18:18,472 --> 00:18:21,433
So it's privacy software
that's also anti-piracy?

398
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:22,768
You have a way of doing this?

399
00:18:22,851 --> 00:18:25,938
Well, it's just a Boolean-driven
aggregation, really,

400
00:18:26,021 --> 00:18:28,232
of what programmers call "hacker-traps..."

401
00:18:28,315 --> 00:18:31,485
[narrator] <i>But as she listened</i>
<i>to her cousin discuss computer technology</i>

402
00:18:31,568 --> 00:18:36,490
<i>she had no understanding of,</i>
<i>she lost that feeling of superiority,</i>

403
00:18:37,032 --> 00:18:38,951
<i>and her self-esteem plummeted</i>

404
00:18:39,034 --> 00:18:41,411
<i>as she started to question the entirety</i>

405
00:18:41,495 --> 00:18:44,581
<i>of what she'd done with her life</i>
<i>for the last several years.</i>

406

...and they want to steal
your music and copy your movies

407
00:18:48,418 --> 00:18:50,963
or just look at your photos,
you know, this prevents that.

408
00:18:51,046 --> 00:18:53,423
It just neutralizes that
so it's not even a threat.

409
00:18:53,507 --> 00:18:54,883
It's called Fakeblock.

410
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:55,884
Great name.

411
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:58,387
Well, it's super low-hanging fruit.
Someone's gonna do it.

412
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:00,139
We're just trying to be those guys.

413
00:19:01,265 --> 00:19:03,225
[narrator] <i>Maeby was feeling discouraged</i>

414

<i>as she got back on the bus</i>
<i>for high school.</i>

00:19:06,061 --> 00:19:07,855
You want to get high
with us behind the gym?

416
00:19:07,938 --> 00:19:08,981
Wait, we don't know her.

417
00:19:09,064 --> 00:19:10,941
I hear there's an undercover cop
at school.

418
00:19:11,024 --> 00:19:12,985
Can you imagine
what kind of loser pretends

419
00:19:13,068 --> 00:19:14,945
to be in high school
when they're in their 20s?

420
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:16,446
It's pretty gutsy, right?

421
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:19,032
I mean, it's better
to take the risk, right?

422
00:19:19,116 --> 00:19:20,868
[both] Yeah, maybe you're right.

423
00:19:22,244 --> 00:19:23,078
Cop.

424
00:19:23,328 --> 00:19:26,331
Hey, how was your tutor?
He gonna take you away from me?

425
00:19:26,415 --> 00:19:28,959
Not until his software hits
and he can buy me an apartment.

426
00:19:29,376 --> 00:19:30,711
I'm living in a [bleeps] hole.

427

A Wild Turkey?

-There you go.
-Thank you.

434

I'm supposed to believe you're 17?

435

Oh, no, sorry.

436
00:19:50,939 --> 00:19:52,858
That's my fake for sneaking back
into high school.

437

After 21, it is illegal for you to enroll

"Lurk."

00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:51,333
