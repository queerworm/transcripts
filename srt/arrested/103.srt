00:00:01,292 --> 00:00:02,877
male narrator: NOW THE STORY 
OF A WEALTHY FAMILY

2
00:00:02,877 --> 00:00:03,919
WHO LOST EVERYTHING

3
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:05,005
AND THE ONE SON

4
00:00:05,005 --> 00:00:07,965
WHO HAD NO CHOICE 
BUT TO KEEP THEM ALL TOGETHER.

5
00:00:13,513 --> 00:00:15,598
IT'S "ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT."

6
00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:19,227
IT WAS SUNDAY MORNING,

7
00:00:19,227 --> 00:00:21,104
AND MICHAEL 
WAS MAKING CORNBALLS,

8
00:00:21,104 --> 00:00:22,813
A BLUTH FAMILY FAVORITE

9
00:00:22,813 --> 00:00:25,733
SINCE GEORGE SR. UNSUCCESSFULLY 
TRIED TO MARKET THE DEVICE

10
00:00:25,733 --> 00:00:27,152
IN THE MID '70s.

11
00:00:27,152 --> 00:00:28,361
- TIME TO PULL OUT THE BASKET,

12
00:00:28,361 --> 00:00:29,820
AND WE DIG INTO SOME HOT--

13
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:30,905
SON OF A BITCH!

14
00:00:30,905 --> 00:00:32,323
- OH! 
LOOK WHAT YOU DID!

15
00:00:32,323 --> 00:00:33,866
- WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU, 
YOU MINCING--

16
00:00:33,866 --> 00:00:34,950
[all gasp]

17
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:37,203
narrator: IT WAS A RITUAL 
MICHAEL SHARED WITH HIS SON

18
00:00:37,203 --> 00:00:40,290
BEFORE THEIR WEEKLY BIKE RIDE 
TO BALBOA ISLAND.

19
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:42,167
- CAREFUL! 
DON'T TOUCH THAT.

20
00:00:42,167 --> 00:00:43,459
NEVER TOUCH THAT.

21
00:00:43,459 --> 00:00:45,628
REALLY LOOKING FORWARD 
TO OUR RIDE TODAY.

22
00:00:45,628 --> 00:00:48,173
WE BETTER GO EXTRA HARD TO 
WORK OFF THESE CORNBALLS, HUH?

23
00:00:48,173 --> 00:00:49,965
- OR YOU COULD NOT 
EAT THE CORNBALLS

24
00:00:49,965 --> 00:00:52,260
AND LET YOUR KID 
LEAD HIS OWN LIFE.

25
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:54,262
- PLEASE--HE LOVES THIS. 
AM I RIGHT?

26
00:00:54,262 --> 00:00:58,058
- ACTUALLY... 
I CAN'T REALLY GO TODAY.

27
00:00:58,058 --> 00:00:59,559
- HOW'S THAT?

28
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:02,103
- MY--MY BIKE NEEDS A TUNE-UP 
OR SOMETHING.

29
00:01:02,103 --> 00:01:04,230
- LET'S NOT BLAME THE BIKE, 
OKAY?

30
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:07,858
IT'S THE POOR CARPENTER 
THAT BLAMES HIS SHODDY TOOLS--

31
00:01:07,858 --> 00:01:09,444
OW!

32
00:01:09,444 --> 00:01:12,738
[bleep]!

33
00:01:12,738 --> 00:01:16,367
OH, THAT STUPID CORNBALLING 
PIECE OF [bleep].

34
00:01:16,367 --> 00:01:17,785
MM.

35
00:01:17,785 --> 00:01:19,912
- SO I'M GONNA GO, OKAY?

36
00:01:19,912 --> 00:01:20,913
- YEAH, YEAH, IT'S FINE.

37
00:01:20,913 --> 00:01:24,459
IT'S GOOD. 
IT'S OKAY, HAVE FUN.

38
00:01:24,459 --> 00:01:26,586
- GETTING TOO OLD FOR HIS DADDY?

39
00:01:26,586 --> 00:01:28,629
- NO, HE'LL BE FINE.

40
00:01:28,629 --> 00:01:30,256
AND I WOULD BUY HIM 
A FASTER BIKE

41
00:01:30,256 --> 00:01:32,967
IF WE WEREN'T TRYING 
TO SAVE EVERY--

42
00:01:32,967 --> 00:01:34,344
DID YOU GO SHOPPING?

43
00:01:34,344 --> 00:01:35,720
- OH, YEAH, 
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

44
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:37,430
I PAID FOR IT MYSELF.

45
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:38,473
- WITH WHAT?

46
00:01:38,473 --> 00:01:39,807
- COMPANY CREDIT CARD.

47
00:01:39,807 --> 00:01:40,808
- YOU'RE RETURNING THAT.

48
00:01:40,808 --> 00:01:42,143
- BUT-- 
- GET A JOB.

49
00:01:42,143 --> 00:01:44,854
- MICHAEL. 
HEY, THE CORNBALLER!

50
00:01:44,854 --> 00:01:46,897
I THOUGHT THESE THINGS 
WERE ONLY LEGAL IN MEXICO.

51
00:01:46,897 --> 00:01:48,274
narrator: 
IN FACT, THE CORNBALLER

52
00:01:48,274 --> 00:01:49,692
WASN'T LEGAL ANYWHERE,

53
00:01:49,692 --> 00:01:53,070
BUT GEORGE SR. CONTINUED 
TO MARKET IT THERE SUCCESSFULLY.

54
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:54,322
- MUY DELICIOSO.

55
00:01:54,322 --> 00:01:55,781
- [speaking Spanish]

56
00:01:55,781 --> 00:01:58,326
- iSOY LOCO POR LOS CORNBALLS!

57
00:01:58,326 --> 00:01:59,869
- WHERE'D YOU COME FROM?

58
00:01:59,869 --> 00:02:01,912
- I HAD ANOTHER BIG FIGHT 
WITH MARTA.

59
00:02:01,912 --> 00:02:03,373
narrator: 
GOB HAD BEEN HAVING

60
00:02:03,373 --> 00:02:05,458
AN ON-AGAIN, OFF-AGAIN 
RELATIONSHIP WITH MARTA,

61
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:07,960
A SPANISH-LANGUAGE 
SOAP OPERA STAR.

62
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:10,921
- IT LOOKS LIKE I'M GONNA BE 
STAYING HERE FOR A WHILE.

63
00:02:10,921 --> 00:02:12,632
- NO, IT DOESN'T. 
IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE THAT.

64
00:02:12,632 --> 00:02:14,049
I'VE GOT A FULL HOUSE HERE, GOB.

65
00:02:14,049 --> 00:02:15,676
- HE'S JUST IN A BAD MOOD, GOB,

66
00:02:15,676 --> 00:02:17,720
BECAUSE HIS SON 
FEELS SUFFOCATED BY HIM.

67
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,305
- SUFFOCATED? 
REALLY?

68
00:02:19,305 --> 00:02:21,182
- YES, MICHAEL, 
HE'S A TEENAGER.

69
00:02:21,182 --> 00:02:23,643
HE'S PROBABLY GOT 
A LITTLE GIRLFRIEND, AND...

70
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:26,187
WELL, LET'S FACE IT. 
YOU ARE OVERBEARING.

71
00:02:26,187 --> 00:02:27,897
- MAYBE I SHOULD BE 
A LITTLE BIT MORE LIKE YOU

72
00:02:27,897 --> 00:02:29,149
WHEN IT COMES TO PARENTING, HUH?

73
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:30,233
NO BORDERS, NO LIMITS,

74
00:02:30,233 --> 00:02:32,943
"GO AHEAD, TOUCH THE CORNBALLER. 
YOU KNOW BEST."

75
00:02:32,943 --> 00:02:34,320
- MICHAEL, IF I COULD

76
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:38,032
STICK MY PRETTY LITTLE NOSE 
IN HERE FOR ONE SECOND...

77
00:02:38,032 --> 00:02:39,659
WHEN I WAS A PSYCHIATRIST,

78
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:41,286
AND THIS IS BEFORE 
I BECAME AN ACTOR--

79
00:02:41,286 --> 00:02:43,037
- YOU'RE STILL NOT AN ACTOR.

80
00:02:43,037 --> 00:02:44,164
- LOVELY.

81
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:46,166
I SAW A LOT OF THIS TYPE 
OF BEHAVIOR,

82
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:47,833
AND I THINK 
WHAT YOU'RE EXPERIENCING

83
00:02:47,833 --> 00:02:50,711
IS YOUR SON'S VERY NORMAL NEED

84
00:02:50,711 --> 00:02:55,174
TO DISTANCE HIMSELF 
FROM HIS OVERBEARING FATHER.

85
00:02:55,174 --> 00:02:57,009
AM I TOUCHING SOMETHING?

86
00:02:57,009 --> 00:02:58,761
HOT. 
HOT-HOT.

87
00:02:58,761 --> 00:03:00,137
- BE CAREFUL.

88
00:03:00,137 --> 00:03:02,765
- [gasping]

89
00:03:02,765 --> 00:03:05,310
- YOU ALL RIGHT?

90
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:06,561
- AH, YES...

91
00:03:06,561 --> 00:03:09,522
NOW, TAKE MY DAUGHTER, 
FOR EXAMPLE.

92
00:03:09,522 --> 00:03:12,442
SHE LIVES HER LIFE, 
AND I GET THE PLEASURE

93
00:03:12,442 --> 00:03:14,610
OF GUESSING 
WHAT THAT MIGHT ENTAIL.

94
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:16,279
NOW, WATCH THIS.

95
00:03:16,279 --> 00:03:18,030
MAEBY, WHERE ARE YOU OFF TO

96
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:20,491
ON THIS GLORIOUS 
SUNDAY AFTERNOON?

97
00:03:20,491 --> 00:03:21,784
[sotto voce] 
SHE WON'T TELL ME.

98
00:03:21,784 --> 00:03:23,160
- I'M GOING TO AUDITION 
FOR A PLAY.

99
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:25,246
- WELL, THAT TIME 
IT DIDN'T WORK.

100
00:03:25,246 --> 00:03:26,247
WHAT--WHAT PLAY?

101
00:03:26,247 --> 00:03:29,542
- IT'S FOR HIGH SCHOOL. 
YOU CAN'T AUDITION.

102
00:03:29,542 --> 00:03:31,377
- I WAS TOTALLY WRONG.

103
00:03:31,377 --> 00:03:34,004
SHE'S REACHING OUT 
TO HER ACTOR DADDY.

104
00:03:34,004 --> 00:03:36,799
DOES ANYONE HAVE AN ICE PACK?

105
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:38,218
narrator: IN TRUTH, MAEBY WAS

106
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:40,220
REACHING OUT TO A BOY 
NAMED STEVE HOLT,

107
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:42,888
WHO WAS AUDITIONING FOR THE LEAD 
IN A SCHOOL PLAY.

108
00:03:42,888 --> 00:03:45,683
- "I WOULD KISS 
BEFORE I SPOKE."

109
00:03:45,683 --> 00:03:47,727
narrator: MAEBY DECIDED 
TO AUDITION AS WELL,

110
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:51,606
LOOKING FOR A CHANCE 
TO GET CLOSER TO STEVE.

111
00:03:51,606 --> 00:03:53,148
- AND THEN WE ACTUALLY 
GET TO KISS, RIGHT?

112
00:03:53,148 --> 00:03:55,610
- GEORGE MICHAEL ALSO CHOSE 
TO AUDITION,

113
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:58,195
LOOKING FOR A CHANCE TO GET 
CLOSER TO HIS COUSIN MAEBY.

114
00:03:58,195 --> 00:03:59,947
- "I WOULD KISS 
BEFORE I SPOKE."

115
00:03:59,947 --> 00:04:01,449
AND THEN THERE'S A KISS, RIGHT?

116
00:04:01,449 --> 00:04:02,742
- LOUDER.

117
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:04,327
- AND THEN THERE'S A KISS, 
RIGHT?

118
00:04:04,327 --> 00:04:06,579
narrator: LATER, THE CAST LIST 
WAS POSTED.

119
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:08,706
- STEVE HOLT!

120
00:04:08,706 --> 00:04:10,541
- STEVE HOLT!

121
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:13,461
- STAND-IN FOR STEVE HOLT?

122
00:04:13,461 --> 00:04:14,712
- STEVE HOLT!

123
00:04:18,215 --> 00:04:20,050
narrator: MICHAEL WENT 
TO GET HIS SON A NEW BIKE

124
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:21,844
TO KEEP HIM FROM SLIPPING AWAY,

125
00:04:21,844 --> 00:04:23,763
WHILE MICHAEL'S MOTHER 
WAS GIVING UP HOPE

126
00:04:23,763 --> 00:04:26,432
THAT HER SON BUSTER 
WOULD EVER LEAVE HER SIDE.

127
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:29,519
- ZIP ME UP.

128
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:31,103
narrator: 
USUALLY AT THIS TIME OF YEAR,

129
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:33,981
BUSTER WOULD RETURN TO 
HIS POST-GRADUATE STUDIES.

130
00:04:33,981 --> 00:04:36,233
BUT WITHOUT THE RESOURCES 
TO AFFORD IT,

131
00:04:36,233 --> 00:04:39,820
HIS SUMMER VACATION 
WAS EXTENDING INTO THE FALL.

132
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:41,572
- MOM! MOM!

133
00:04:41,572 --> 00:04:43,324
WHOO-HOO!

134
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,162
narrator: AND LUCILLE WAS 
BEGINNING TO RESENT IT.

135
00:04:48,162 --> 00:04:50,373
[ringing] 
- WHAT?

136
00:04:50,373 --> 00:04:53,125
- HI, MAMA, IT'S LINDS.

137
00:04:53,125 --> 00:04:55,670
- IT'LL FLY OUT ON ITS OWN.

138
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:57,713
WHY ARE YOU CALLING ME? 
WHAT DO YOU NEED?

139
00:04:57,713 --> 00:05:00,257
- VERY NICE, MOM. 
I DON'T NEED ANYTHING.

140
00:05:00,257 --> 00:05:03,844
MY DAUGHTER NEEDS 
SOME NEW SCHOOL CLOTHES.

141
00:05:03,844 --> 00:05:04,929
- BUSTER!

142
00:05:04,929 --> 00:05:06,514
- IT'S A BIRD.

143
00:05:06,514 --> 00:05:08,891
- I KNOW IT'S A BIRD. 
I'M ON THE PHONE.

144
00:05:08,891 --> 00:05:10,685
- IT WALKED ON MY PILLOW!

145
00:05:10,685 --> 00:05:12,812
- LOOK, I HAVE A CHILD THAT 
COSTS ME MONEY TOO, YOU KNOW.

146
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:14,397
WHY CAN'T YOU GET A JOB?

147
00:05:14,397 --> 00:05:16,106
- WHAT IS IT WITH 
THIS FAMILY AND WORKING?

148
00:05:16,106 --> 00:05:17,692
MICHAEL JUST GAVE ME 
THE EXACT SAME LECTURE

149
00:05:17,692 --> 00:05:18,859
IN FRONT OF EVERYBODY.

150
00:05:18,859 --> 00:05:20,277
- EVERYBODY? 
WHO'S EVERYBODY?

151
00:05:20,277 --> 00:05:21,362
[glass breaking]

152
00:05:21,362 --> 00:05:22,822
WHO'S EVERYBODY?

153
00:05:22,822 --> 00:05:25,908
- YOU KNOW, THE KIDS, 
GOB, TOBIAS, EVERYBODY.

154
00:05:25,908 --> 00:05:27,993
[wings flapping] 
- HE DIDN'T INVITE BUSTER.

155
00:05:27,993 --> 00:05:30,788
BUSTER'S HIS BROTHER TOO. 
WHAT'S WRONG WITH BUSTER?

156
00:05:30,788 --> 00:05:33,583
narrator: AND EVEN AS SHE ASKED 
THE QUESTION, LUCILLE REALIZED

157
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:34,792
THAT PERHAPS IT WAS TIME

158
00:05:34,792 --> 00:05:36,752
TO LET HER OWN BABY BIRD 
FLY AWAY.

159
00:05:36,752 --> 00:05:38,003
- WHY DO I HAVE TO TAKE HIM?

160
00:05:38,003 --> 00:05:39,547
- BECAUSE HE'S YOUR BROTHER.

161
00:05:39,547 --> 00:05:41,090
AND YOU RUN AROUND 
WITH EVERYONE ELSE,

162
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:43,509
GOING ON BIKE RIDES, 
MAKING CORNHOLES.

163
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:44,594
- MOM, LISTEN--

164
00:05:44,594 --> 00:05:48,848
- EVERYONE'S LAUGHING AND RIDING 
AND CORNHOLING EXCEPT BUSTER.

165
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:51,308
AND I KNOW HE'S NOT THE 
SHARPEST KNIFE IN THE DRAWER,

166
00:05:51,308 --> 00:05:52,768
BUT HE'S SENSITIVE, MICHAEL,

167
00:05:52,768 --> 00:05:55,354
AND YOU COULD PRETEND 
TO BE INTERESTED IN HIM.

168
00:05:55,354 --> 00:05:58,441
- FINE, HE CAN HANG OUT, 
BUT HE'S GOING TO WORK, OKAY?

169
00:05:58,441 --> 00:06:01,861
THIS IS NOT GOING TO BE 
A DAY AT THE BEACH.

170
00:06:01,861 --> 00:06:03,153
- TH-THAT'S COOL.

171
00:06:03,153 --> 00:06:05,155
MOM PACKED ME 
A CHANGE OF CLOTHES.

172
00:06:05,155 --> 00:06:06,991
narrator: 
SO BUSTER STAYED,

173
00:06:06,991 --> 00:06:09,702
AND MICHAEL MADE HIM 
BUILD THE NEW BIKE.

174
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:11,704
- IT'S IN THAT BIG BOX 
IN MY OFFICE.

175
00:06:11,704 --> 00:06:12,705
HEY.

176
00:06:12,705 --> 00:06:14,081
- MICHAEL.

177
00:06:14,081 --> 00:06:15,332
- GOB, WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE,

178
00:06:15,332 --> 00:06:17,418
AND WHY ARE YOU IN A BATHROBE?

179
00:06:17,418 --> 00:06:18,544
- WHAT'S HE DOING HERE?

180
00:06:18,544 --> 00:06:20,546
WHY IS HE IN HIS BATHING SUIT?

181
00:06:20,546 --> 00:06:22,715
- MOM DROPPED ME OFF 
TO SPEND TIME WITH MICHAEL.

182
00:06:22,715 --> 00:06:24,425
- SPEND TIME WITH MICHAEL,

183
00:06:24,425 --> 00:06:26,469
OR TO SERVE HER OWN 
MENOPAUSAL NEEDS?

184
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:28,220
- SHE'S ALWAYS GOT TO WEDGE 
HERSELF IN THE MIDDLE OF US

185
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:30,473
SO SHE CAN CONTROL EVERYTHING.

186
00:06:30,473 --> 00:06:32,433
- YEAH.

187
00:06:32,433 --> 00:06:35,310
MOM'S AWESOME.

188
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:37,229
MAYBE WE SHOULD CALL HER.

189
00:06:39,607 --> 00:06:41,191
- SO WHY ARE YOU IN YOUR ROBE?

190
00:06:41,191 --> 00:06:43,193
- I CAMPED OUT IN 
THE BOARDROOM LAST NIGHT.

191
00:06:43,193 --> 00:06:45,530
WHAT WITH YOU KICKING ME 
OUT OF YOUR HOUSE--[sniffs]

192
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:48,115
THERE ARE FEW PLACES LEFT 
THAT YOU HAVE THAT I CAN STAY.

193
00:06:48,115 --> 00:06:51,619
- HMM, WELL, 
YOU CAN'T STAY HERE EITHER.

194
00:06:51,619 --> 00:06:55,414
- [scoffs] 
LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHING.

195
00:06:55,414 --> 00:06:58,250
IS THIS A BUSINESS DECISION, 
OR IS IT PERSONAL?

196
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:01,086
'CAUSE IF IT'S BUSINESS, 
I'LL GO AWAY HAPPILY.

197
00:07:01,086 --> 00:07:04,006
BUT IF IT'S PERSONAL, 
I'LL GO AWAY,

198
00:07:04,006 --> 00:07:07,510
BUT I WON'T BE HAPPY.

199
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:09,094
- IT'S PERSONAL.

200
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:15,017
- I AM SO SORRY.

201
00:07:15,017 --> 00:07:16,727
narrator: 
MICHAEL'S SON, MEANWHILE,

202
00:07:16,727 --> 00:07:19,021
WAS WAITING WITH HIS COUSIN 
FOR THEIR FIRST REHEARSAL.

203
00:07:19,021 --> 00:07:20,565
- I'M SURPRISED 
YOU TRIED OUT FOR THIS.

204
00:07:20,565 --> 00:07:21,816
- YEAH, I JUST LOVE THE THEATER.

205
00:07:21,816 --> 00:07:23,275
- THAT'S GREAT.

206
00:07:23,275 --> 00:07:24,819
I'M JUST DOING IT 
TO KISS STEVE HOLT.

207
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:27,237
- WELL, ACTUALLY, 
I THINK I'M GONNA QUIT.

208
00:07:27,237 --> 00:07:29,073
YEAH, THEATER'S DEAD.

209
00:07:29,073 --> 00:07:31,408
- BUT HE'S ALWAYS GOING 
TO BE AT FOOTBALL PRACTICE,

210
00:07:31,408 --> 00:07:33,160
SO I'M GONNA HAVE TO KISS 
THE STAND-IN.

211
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:36,997
- BUT, NO, NO, 
I LOVE THE THEATER,

212
00:07:36,997 --> 00:07:41,418
AND I GAVE MY WORD, 
SO I'M BACK IN.

213
00:07:41,418 --> 00:07:44,129
narrator: TOBIAS, MEANWHILE, 
STOPPED BY THE SCHOOL.

214
00:07:44,129 --> 00:07:45,673
- I KNOW WHY YOU'RE DOING THIS.

215
00:07:45,673 --> 00:07:48,300
- DAD, WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? 
GO AWAY.

216
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:51,136
- YES, BECAUSE THE DIRECTOR 
MIGHT BE HERE SOON, RIGHT?

217
00:07:51,136 --> 00:07:52,638
OOPS. 
TOO LATE.

218
00:07:52,638 --> 00:07:54,139
HE'S ALREADY HERE.

219
00:07:54,139 --> 00:07:58,310
HELLO, EVERYONE, 
AND WELCOME TO THE THEATER.

220
00:08:01,396 --> 00:08:04,108
I AM DR. TOBIAS FUNKE,

221
00:08:04,108 --> 00:08:09,572
AND I WILL BE 
YOUR NEW DIRECTOR.

222
00:08:09,572 --> 00:08:12,282
- OH, MY GOD.

223
00:08:12,282 --> 00:08:13,826
- [chuckles]

224
00:08:13,826 --> 00:08:15,495
narrator: TOBIAS HAD GOTTEN 
THE DIRECTING JOB

225
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:17,329
BY MEETING 
WITH THE SCHOOL PRINCIPAL.

226
00:08:17,329 --> 00:08:19,373
- AND YOU TELL ME YOU'VE GOT 
SOME P.E. TEACHER DIRECTING?

227
00:08:19,373 --> 00:08:23,002
THAT JUST MAKES ME WANT TO 
PUKE ALL OVER YOUR HEAD, SIR.

228
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:26,756
GIVE ME A CHANCE 
TO TELL THE BARD'S TALE,

229
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:28,841
AND I GIVE YOU MY WORD 
ON HUMBLE KNEE,

230
00:08:28,841 --> 00:08:34,722
WHENCE YOU SHALL NOT SAY 
IT WASN'T E'ER TO BE.

231
00:08:34,722 --> 00:08:36,682
- JERRY, YOU COOL WITH THIS?

232
00:08:36,682 --> 00:08:38,726
- SURE. 
LET THE LITTLE FRUIT DO IT.

233
00:08:38,726 --> 00:08:40,102
- HUZZAH!

234
00:08:40,102 --> 00:08:41,395
narrator: 
AS THE DAYS WENT BY,

235
00:08:41,395 --> 00:08:42,980
BUSTER'S APPRENTICESHIP 
WAS PROVING

236
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:45,525
MORE TRYING 
THAN MICHAEL HAD ANTICIPATED.

237
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:47,735
- WE'RE EXCITED. 
WE WANT YOUR BUSINESS.

238
00:08:47,735 --> 00:08:50,738
- [yawns loudly]

239
00:08:52,489 --> 00:08:54,449
- AND, UH, EVERYBODY 
AT THE BLUTH COMPANY--

240
00:08:54,449 --> 00:08:56,118
- [yawns loudly]

241
00:08:56,118 --> 00:08:57,828
HERE I GO AGAIN.

242
00:09:01,081 --> 00:09:03,167
narrator: AND JUST WHEN 
HE COULD TAKE NO MORE...

243
00:09:03,167 --> 00:09:05,545
- AND WE'RE BACK ON TRACK. 
AND WE'RE FOCUSED.

244
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:06,546
[clattering]

245
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:08,005
AND, BUSTER,

246
00:09:08,005 --> 00:09:11,926
YOU CAN'T DO THAT 
IN THE SNACK ROOM, PAL?

247
00:09:11,926 --> 00:09:15,012
- MOM TOLD ME TO 
STAY AWAY FROM MICROWAVES.

248
00:09:15,012 --> 00:09:17,514
AND BESIDES, THIS IS GONNA BE

249
00:09:17,514 --> 00:09:21,310
THE MOST BITCHINGLY FAST BIKE 
IN ALL OF ORANGE COUNTY.

250
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:23,813
- REALLY? 
- YOUR SON IS GONNA LOVE IT.

251
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:25,981
- WELL, I GUESS 3:40

252
00:09:25,981 --> 00:09:28,525
IS AS GOOD A TIME AS ANY 
TO CALL IT A DAY.

253
00:09:28,525 --> 00:09:30,319
narrator: SO MICHAEL LEFT 
FOR THE HIGH SCHOOL

254
00:09:30,319 --> 00:09:32,404
HOPING TO RECONNECT 
WITH HIS SON,

255
00:09:32,404 --> 00:09:34,949
WHILE TOBIAS'S ATTEMPT 
TO RECONNECT WITH HIS DAUGHTER

256
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:37,326
HIT A SNAG.

257
00:09:37,326 --> 00:09:39,662
- STOP! STOP IT. IT'S ALL WRONG.

258
00:09:39,662 --> 00:09:41,205
- BUT WE WERE JUST ABOUT 
TO DO THE KISS--

259
00:09:41,205 --> 00:09:42,206
- KISS. 
I KNOW.

260
00:09:42,206 --> 00:09:43,624
IT DOESN'T WORK.

261
00:09:43,624 --> 00:09:46,043
LOOK, YOU ARE PLAYING ADULTS 
WITH FULLY--

262
00:09:48,713 --> 00:09:50,089
PICK THAT UP, PLEASE--

263
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:51,924
WITH FULLY FORMED LIBIDOS,

264
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:56,095
NOT TWO YOUNG MEN 
PLAYING GRAB-ASS IN THE SHOWER.

265
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:57,096
[clattering]

266
00:09:57,096 --> 00:09:59,514
WOULD YOU HOLD THE WORK, PLEASE?

267
00:09:59,514 --> 00:10:01,016
OH, MICHAEL.

268
00:10:01,016 --> 00:10:03,769
- DAD, WH-- 
- SO, YOU'RE IN A PLAY, HUH?

269
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:05,145
- I'M NOT.

270
00:10:05,145 --> 00:10:07,648
I QUIT.

271
00:10:07,648 --> 00:10:10,317
- MAEBY.

272
00:10:10,317 --> 00:10:11,694
- WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME?

273
00:10:11,694 --> 00:10:12,987
- WELL, IT'S NOT 
REALLY IMPORTANT.

274
00:10:12,987 --> 00:10:14,614
I'M JUST A STAND-IN.

275
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:16,616
- AND YOU'RE ASHAMED.

276
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:19,576
WELL, THIS SHOULD 
CHEER YOU UP, HMM?

277
00:10:19,576 --> 00:10:21,036
I LEFT WORK EARLY.

278
00:10:21,036 --> 00:10:22,830
I THOUGHT MAYBE WE'D GO 
FOR A RIDE TODAY.

279
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:24,999
- NO, I CAN'T GO 
ON A BIKE RIDE RIGHT NOW.

280
00:10:24,999 --> 00:10:26,751
- WHY, BECAUSE OF THE PLAY? 
YOU'RE JUST A STAND-IN.

281
00:10:26,751 --> 00:10:29,211
- NO, NO, IT'S NOT THE PLAY. 
IT'S JUST--

282
00:10:29,211 --> 00:10:30,796
YOU KNOW, I CAN'T GO ON 
A MILLION BIKE RIDES

283
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:32,422
WHENEVER YOU WANT ME TO.

284
00:10:32,422 --> 00:10:34,049
- WAIT A MINUTE. 
WAIT A MINUTE.

285
00:10:34,049 --> 00:10:36,301
HEY, IS IT ABOUT A GIRL?

286
00:10:36,301 --> 00:10:40,723
- NO! IT'S NOT. 
JUST DROP IT, DAD.

287
00:10:40,723 --> 00:10:43,558
- WHAT, IS LINDSAY RIGHT? 
AM I REALLY SUFFOCATING HIM?

288
00:10:43,558 --> 00:10:46,687
- WELL, THEY'RE DIFFERENT PEOPLE 
EVERY DAY, TEENAGERS.

289
00:10:46,687 --> 00:10:48,188
HORMONES ALL ABLAZE.

290
00:10:48,188 --> 00:10:49,815
EXCEPT, OF COURSE, 
WHEN THEY'RE ON STAGE,

291
00:10:49,815 --> 00:10:51,191
WHEN I NEED IT.

292
00:10:51,191 --> 00:10:53,443
- NO, HE SAID IT WASN'T 
ABOUT A GIRL.

293
00:10:53,443 --> 00:10:56,613
[sighs] 
MAYBE HE REALLY IS PULLING AWAY.

294
00:10:59,533 --> 00:11:02,703
- NOT A GIRL?

295
00:11:02,703 --> 00:11:07,249
OF COURSE.

296
00:11:07,249 --> 00:11:10,502
METHINKS A CUPID 
I SHALL PLAY.

297
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:17,092
MM. MMM. MMM.

298
00:11:19,136 --> 00:11:21,513
narrator: TOBIAS CAME UP WITH 
A NEW PLAN FOR THE PLAY...

299
00:11:21,513 --> 00:11:23,640
AND A WAY TO CONNECT 
TO GEORGE MICHAEL.

300
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:25,559
- I KNOW WHY YOU'RE IN THE PLAY.

301
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:27,728
- WHAT? 
- WATCH THIS.

302
00:11:27,728 --> 00:11:30,647
OKAY, EVERYBODY. 
WELL, WE'VE LOST A LEADING LADY,

303
00:11:30,647 --> 00:11:33,150
BUT DID YOU KNOW 
THAT IN SHAKESPEARE'S DAY

304
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:34,860
THAT THE WOMEN'S ROLES...

305
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:37,529
WERE PLAYED BY MEN?

306
00:11:37,529 --> 00:11:39,073
FANCY THAT.

307
00:11:40,657 --> 00:11:42,993
HMM.

308
00:11:42,993 --> 00:11:45,579
GEORGE MICHAEL, 
YOU KNOW STEVEN'S LINES, YES?

309
00:11:45,579 --> 00:11:46,789
- SORT OF.

310
00:11:46,789 --> 00:11:48,207
- FINE. 
THEN YOU ARE MY BENEDICT.

311
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:49,959
AND STEVEN HOLT-- 
WHERE IS STEVEN HOLT?

312
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:51,210
- STEVE HOLT!

313
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:53,253
- YES, GET READY 
FOR THE ACTING CHALLENGE

314
00:11:53,253 --> 00:11:55,297
OF YOUR SWEET YOUNG LIFE, 
FAIR LADY,

315
00:11:55,297 --> 00:11:58,550
FOR YOU ARE MY BEATRICE.

316
00:11:58,550 --> 00:12:00,385
- BEATRICE!

317
00:12:00,385 --> 00:12:04,306
LET'S TAKE IT FROM, "PEACE, 
I WILL STOP THY MOUTH."

318
00:12:04,306 --> 00:12:09,228
AND NOW WE'LL SEE 
IF SOME SPARKS FLY.

narrator: 
AS GEORGE MICHAEL CONTEMPLATED

320
00:12:10,896 --> 00:12:12,314
KISSING HIS RIVAL,

321
00:12:12,314 --> 00:12:14,524
MICHAEL SOUGHT 
HIS FATHER'S ADVICE.

322
00:12:14,524 --> 00:12:16,193
- YOU THINK YOU NEVER HURT ME?

323
00:12:16,193 --> 00:12:17,319
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

324
00:12:17,319 --> 00:12:18,570
WHEN HAVE I EVER REBELLED?

325
00:12:18,570 --> 00:12:19,989
- I NEVER SEE YOU ANYMORE, 
MICHAEL.

326
00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:21,615
- YOU'RE IN PRISON.

327
00:12:21,615 --> 00:12:24,743
AND I WAS HERE YESTERDAY.

328
00:12:24,743 --> 00:12:26,703
- OH, YEAH, THAT'S-THAT'S-- 
I'M SORRY.

329
00:12:26,703 --> 00:12:28,622
I COULDN'T BREAK AWAY 
FROM THE POKER GAME.

330
00:12:28,622 --> 00:12:30,791
CAPITAL "G" 
WAS DOWN TO HIS BOXERS.

331
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:33,293
- STRIP POKER? 
- YEAH, AND IT'S TOUGH.

332
00:12:33,293 --> 00:12:37,006
WE CAN REALLY 
ONLY PLAY ABOUT TWO HANDS.

333
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:40,300
LISTEN-- 
[exhales]

334
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:44,638
LET HIM GO. 
LET YOUR SON GO.

335
00:12:44,638 --> 00:12:46,390
- I CAN'T DO THAT, DAD. 
HE NEEDS ME.

336
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:47,933
- MICHAEL, YOU DON'T WANT TO 
MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE

337
00:12:47,933 --> 00:12:49,184
YOUR MOM MADE WITH BUSTER.

338
00:12:49,184 --> 00:12:51,561
- YEAH, BOY. 
WHAT HAPPENED THERE?

339
00:12:51,561 --> 00:12:53,188
- I REALLY DON'T KNOW.

340
00:12:53,188 --> 00:12:56,066
MAYBE IT WAS THE 11 MONTHS 
HE SPENT IN THE WOMB.

341
00:12:56,066 --> 00:12:57,651
THE DOCTOR SAID 
THERE WERE CLAW MARKS

342
00:12:57,651 --> 00:13:00,779
ON THE WALLS 
OF HER UTERUS, BUT...

343
00:13:00,779 --> 00:13:03,073
HE WAS OUR MIRACLE BABY, 
YOU KNOW?

344
00:13:03,073 --> 00:13:05,700
AND I WAS JUST TOO BURNED OUT 
ON RAISING YOU GUYS TO CARE,

345
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:09,579
SO...HE TURNED OUT 
A LITTLE, UH, SOFT.

346
00:13:09,579 --> 00:13:12,624
- [yawns loudly] 
- A LITTLE DOUGHY.

347
00:13:12,624 --> 00:13:13,959
I DON'T KNOW. 
MAYBE IT WAS MY FAULT.

348
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:15,127
- [continues yawning]

349
00:13:15,127 --> 00:13:17,046
- MAYBE I JUST IGNORED THE GUY.

350
00:13:20,215 --> 00:13:24,719
- WOW, WE'RE JUST BLOWING 
THROUGH NAP TIME, AREN'T WE?

351
00:13:27,014 --> 00:13:29,099
- YEAH, I GOTTA LET MY SON GO.

352
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:34,688
narrator: LINDSAY, MEANWHILE, 
STILL HAD THE DRESS,

353
00:13:34,688 --> 00:13:38,067
AND SHE WAS STARTING TO GET 
SOME POSITIVE REACTIONS TO IT.

354
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:40,735
- LOOK AT YOU.

355
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:42,029
- I AM.

356
00:13:42,029 --> 00:13:43,613
narrator: SO SHE DECIDED 
TO HIDE IT

357
00:13:43,613 --> 00:13:45,615
IN THE ATTIC CRAWL SPACE.

358
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:49,369
- [snoring]

359
00:13:49,369 --> 00:13:50,745
[loud piano]

360
00:13:50,745 --> 00:13:53,623
- [singing] 
YOU'RE AS COLD AS ICE

361
00:13:53,623 --> 00:13:56,376
WILLING TO SACRIFICE

362
00:13:56,376 --> 00:13:57,627
[piano lid slams]

363
00:13:57,627 --> 00:13:59,546
ARE YOU CRAZY? 
I'M A MAGICIAN.

364
00:13:59,546 --> 00:14:01,340
I MAKE MY LIVING WITH MY HANDS.

365
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:02,967
AND IF I'M GOING TO BE 
STAYING HERE--

366
00:14:02,967 --> 00:14:04,301
- STAYING HERE?

367
00:14:04,301 --> 00:14:06,136
WHAT, DID THAT MEXICAN 
THROW YOU OUT?

368
00:14:06,136 --> 00:14:07,721
- SHE'S NOT 
"THAT MEXICAN," MOM.

369
00:14:07,721 --> 00:14:09,139
SHE'S MY MEXICAN.

370
00:14:09,139 --> 00:14:11,558
AND SHE'S COLOMBIAN 
OR SOMETHING.

371
00:14:11,558 --> 00:14:12,851
ANYWAY, IT'S OVER.

372
00:14:12,851 --> 00:14:14,519
- YOU'VE GOT THREE DAYS.

373
00:14:14,519 --> 00:14:16,563
- HEY, IF I CAN'T FIND 
A HORNY IMMIGRANT BY THEN,

374
00:14:16,563 --> 00:14:17,898
I DON'T DESERVE TO STAY HERE.

375
00:14:17,898 --> 00:14:21,068
[both laugh]

376
00:14:21,068 --> 00:14:22,402
OH!

377
00:14:22,402 --> 00:14:23,988
narrator: 
BACK AT THE MODEL HOME,

378
00:14:23,988 --> 00:14:25,990
MICHAEL WAS ADJUSTING 
TO THE ABSENCE OF HIS SON

379
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:28,617
BY ENJOYING THE COMPANY 
OF HIS BROTHER.

380
00:14:28,617 --> 00:14:30,244
- YOU KNOW, 
I'M IN PRETTY GOOD SHAPE.

381
00:14:30,244 --> 00:14:33,205
YOU COULD BE EATING MY DUST 
ALL DAY, SLOWPOKE.

382
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:34,581
narrator: 
AND BUSTER WAS STARTING

383
00:14:34,581 --> 00:14:35,958
TO GIVE AS GOOD AS HE GOT.

384
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:40,254
- YEAH, AND YOU MIGHT BE 
EATING [bleep]...

385
00:14:40,254 --> 00:14:43,507
[bleeping continues]

386
00:14:43,507 --> 00:14:45,759
- WELL, LET'S HOPE 
IT DOESN'T COME TO THAT.

387
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:47,594
[footsteps approaching]

388
00:14:47,594 --> 00:14:51,390
HEY, TOBIAS. 
HOW'S MY SON DOING?

389
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:54,059
- OH, WELL, HE DIDN'T WANT 
TO REHEARSE TODAY,

390
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:57,146
BUT I DO THINK I HAVE A HANDLE 
ON WHAT HE'S GOING THROUGH.

391
00:14:57,146 --> 00:14:59,148
I WISH I COULD SAY THE SAME 
FOR STEVE HOLT, THOUGH.

392
00:14:59,148 --> 00:15:01,358
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE HELL 
HER PROBLEM IS.

393
00:15:01,358 --> 00:15:02,985
- HER? 
- OH, UH, I'M SORRY.

394
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:04,819
I SAY THAT BECAUSE 
I SWITCHED THE PARTS,

395
00:15:04,819 --> 00:15:08,115
BUT IT'S STILL--[sighs]

396
00:15:08,115 --> 00:15:09,866
OFF.

397
00:15:09,866 --> 00:15:12,577
PERHAPS IF 
SHE DRESSED AS A WOMAN.

398
00:15:12,577 --> 00:15:14,246
- SHE?

399
00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:17,499
- OH, FOR THE LOVE OF GOD. 
SHE'S PLAYING A WOMAN.

400
00:15:21,378 --> 00:15:23,047
- LOOK WHO'S BACK.

401
00:15:24,881 --> 00:15:27,634
- I'M EXHAUSTED. 
- NEIMAN'S AGAIN, HUH?

402
00:15:27,634 --> 00:15:29,594
- ACTUALLY, I'VE BEEN GOING 
TO THE THRIFT STORE,

403
00:15:29,594 --> 00:15:31,638
BUT I'M GOING TO FIND 
A WAY TO KEEP THAT DRESS.

404
00:15:31,638 --> 00:15:35,225
- THINGS DIDN'T WORK OUT 
WITH MOM.

405
00:15:35,225 --> 00:15:39,313
IT WAS UTTERLY MACABRE.

406
00:15:39,313 --> 00:15:40,855
- ZIP ME UP.

407
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:46,070
- SHE ALWAYS MAKES EVERYTHING 
ABOUT HER.

408
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:47,071
- [groans]

409
00:15:47,071 --> 00:15:48,363
SHE'S THE LAST PERSON

410
00:15:48,363 --> 00:15:49,531
I EVER WANT TO 
NEED SOMETHING FROM.

411
00:15:49,531 --> 00:15:50,615
- WELL, SHE LIKES TO BE NEEDED,

412
00:15:50,615 --> 00:15:52,076
JUST AS LONG AS IT DOESN'T 
COST HER ANYTHING.

413
00:15:52,076 --> 00:15:55,745
- IT'S LIKE SHE GETS OFF 
ON BEING WITHHOLDING.

414
00:15:55,745 --> 00:15:57,414
- WHOA, BUSTER.

415
00:15:57,414 --> 00:15:58,748
- LOOK WHO'S GOT 
SOMETHING TO SAY.

416
00:15:58,748 --> 00:16:01,210
- [giggles]

417
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:03,920
I'M MOM, AND I WANNA 
SHOOT DOWN EVERYTHING YOU SAY

418
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,630
SO I FEEL GOOD ABOUT MYSELF.

419
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:07,049
[blows, giggles]

420
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:09,259
- LOOK WHO'S RAGGING 
ON THE OLD LADY.

421
00:16:09,259 --> 00:16:11,761
- HEY, HEY. 
- FINALLY.

422
00:16:11,761 --> 00:16:15,682
- 'CAUSE I'M AN UPTIGHT 
[long bleep]

423
00:16:15,682 --> 00:16:19,103
BUSTER! 
[long bleep]

424
00:16:19,103 --> 00:16:20,937
YOU OLD HORNY SLUT!

425
00:16:24,608 --> 00:16:26,735
- WELL, NO ONE'S GONNA TOP THAT.

426
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:32,032
narrator: AND TOBIAS HAD FOUND 
THE PERFECT WARDROBE

427
00:16:32,032 --> 00:16:33,742
FOR HIS LEADING MAN,

428
00:16:33,742 --> 00:16:37,579
THE RED DRESS HE DISCOVERED 
IN THE ATTIC CRAWL SPACE.

429
00:16:37,579 --> 00:16:39,873
ASSUMING MICHAEL HAD 
FOUND AND RETURNED IT,

430
00:16:39,873 --> 00:16:41,458
LINDSAY CALLED HER MOTHER,

431
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:43,168
HOPING TO GET MONEY 
FOR A NEW ONE.

432
00:16:43,168 --> 00:16:44,211
- WHAT?

433
00:16:44,211 --> 00:16:45,462
- HI, MAMA. IT'S LINDS.

434
00:16:45,462 --> 00:16:46,463
- GET A JOB.

435
00:16:46,463 --> 00:16:47,672
- LOOK, JUST HEAR ME OUT.

436
00:16:47,672 --> 00:16:48,923
IT'S MAEBY'S DRESS.

437
00:16:48,923 --> 00:16:50,592
IT WAS STOLEN FROM HER LOCKER.

438
00:16:50,592 --> 00:16:53,928
THEY BEAT HER UP 
AND, UH, TOOK ALL HER CLOTHES.

439
00:16:53,928 --> 00:16:55,805
- SEND HER OVER. 
I'LL TAKE HER SHOPPING.

440
00:16:55,805 --> 00:16:57,307
- BUSTER WAS RIGHT.

441
00:16:57,307 --> 00:16:59,351
YOU GET OFF ON BEING 
WITHHOLDING, DON'T YOU?

442
00:16:59,351 --> 00:17:01,811
- BUSTER SAID THAT? 
- THAT'S RIGHT.

443
00:17:01,811 --> 00:17:05,149
- MY BUSTER? 
- NOT ANYMORE, APPARENTLY.

444
00:17:05,149 --> 00:17:08,110
narrator: WHILE LUCILLE 
WAS MISSING HER YOUNGEST SON,

445
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:10,362
MICHAEL WAS FINALLY 
ENJOYING HIS COMPANY.

446
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:11,946
- ZIP ME UP.

447
00:17:11,946 --> 00:17:14,658
narrator: AND WHILE BUSTER 
DID BUILD A FASTER BIKE...

448
00:17:14,658 --> 00:17:16,451
HE NEGLECTED 
TO BUILD THE BRAKES.

449
00:17:16,451 --> 00:17:18,120
- I'M FLYING!

450
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:19,121
[loud crash]

451
00:17:19,121 --> 00:17:21,081
- BUSTER?

452
00:17:21,081 --> 00:17:23,792
narrator: AND GEORGE MICHAEL 
HAD NEWS FOR MAEBY.

453
00:17:23,792 --> 00:17:27,254
- SO I QUIT THE PLAY. 
I DON'T REALLY LIKE PLAYS.

454
00:17:27,254 --> 00:17:29,381
ALSO, I THINK YOUR DAD 
THINKS I'M GAY.

455
00:17:29,381 --> 00:17:31,341
- OH, HE THINKS EVERYONE'S GAY.

456
00:17:31,341 --> 00:17:32,967
- SO DO YOU WANNA GET A SODA?

457
00:17:32,967 --> 00:17:34,678
- I CAN'T. 
I'M ACTUALLY BACK IN THE PLAY.

458
00:17:34,678 --> 00:17:36,721
WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE 
OF DRESS REHEARSAL RIGHT NOW.

459
00:17:36,721 --> 00:17:38,348
- BUT I THOUGHT 
STEVE HAD YOUR PART.

460
00:17:38,348 --> 00:17:40,142
narrator: STEVE DID STILL 
HAVE MAEBY'S PART.

461
00:17:40,142 --> 00:17:42,602
AND TOBIAS HAD GIVEN MAEBY 
A NEW PART.

462
00:17:42,602 --> 00:17:44,646
- SO YOU WANT ME 
TO PLAY THE MAN?

463
00:17:44,646 --> 00:17:47,941
- YES. DON'T YOU SEE? 
I CAST THE PARTS ALL WRONG.

464
00:17:47,941 --> 00:17:49,734
IT WAS DADDY'S FAULT.

465
00:17:49,734 --> 00:17:53,822
- AND I STILL GET TO 
KISS STEVE, RIGHT?

466
00:17:53,822 --> 00:17:55,115
IT'S GONNA BE 
A HUGE DISASTER.

467
00:17:55,115 --> 00:17:57,826
I'LL GET YOU TICKETS.

468
00:17:57,826 --> 00:17:59,411
narrator: 
AND MICHAEL TRIED TO SALVAGE

469
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:01,121
WHAT WAS LEFT OF THE DAY...

470
00:18:01,121 --> 00:18:02,747
WITH WHAT WAS LEFT 
OF HIS BROTHER.

471
00:18:02,747 --> 00:18:04,458
I'M A LITTLE SHAKY, BUT--

472
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:07,294
- BUT WE'RE HERE TO WORK. 
- MICHAEL.

473
00:18:07,294 --> 00:18:08,837
- MOM. 
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

474
00:18:08,837 --> 00:18:12,591
- OH, HELLO, BUSTER. 
HERE'S A CANDY BAR.

475
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:14,801
- OH-- 
- NO, I'M WITHHOLDING IT.

476
00:18:14,801 --> 00:18:16,928
LOOK AT ME GETTING OFF.

477
00:18:16,928 --> 00:18:19,764
HOW DARE YOU 
TURN BUSTER AGAINST ME.

478
00:18:19,764 --> 00:18:21,141
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

479
00:18:21,141 --> 00:18:22,559
- I KNOW WHAT 
YOU'VE ALL BEEN SAYING.

480
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:23,810
BUT I'M NOT GOING TO LET YOU

481
00:18:23,810 --> 00:18:25,604
DESTROY MY RELATIONSHIP 
WITH MY SON

482
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:27,897
JUST BECAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE ONE 
WITH YOURS RIGHT NOW.

483
00:18:27,897 --> 00:18:30,609
- WAIT A MINUTE, 
ME AND MY SON ARE FINE,

484
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:32,444
AND THAT IS NOT WHAT THIS IS.

485
00:18:32,444 --> 00:18:35,447
BUSTER IS A GROWN MAN. 
HE CAN MAKE HIS OWN DECISIONS.

486
00:18:35,447 --> 00:18:37,031
WHY DON'T YOU ASK BUSTER 
WHAT HE WANTS.

487
00:18:37,031 --> 00:18:40,076
- MICHAEL, 
I WANT TO GO WITH MOM.

488
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:46,916
- YOU SAID THAT 
SHE SHOOTS YOU DOWN.

489
00:18:46,916 --> 00:18:50,962
- I WAS JUST TRYING TO FIT IN.

490
00:18:50,962 --> 00:18:53,340
- YOU WERE FLYING TODAY, BUDDY.

491
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:56,426
- YES, I WAS FLYING,

492
00:18:56,426 --> 00:18:59,095
BUT A LITTLE TOO CLOSE 
TO THE SUN.

493
00:18:59,095 --> 00:19:01,223
- YOU LET HIM GO IN THE SUN?

494
00:19:01,223 --> 00:19:03,225
GET IN THE BACK SEAT. 
I'LL BE RIGHT OUT.

495
00:19:03,225 --> 00:19:04,851
- FRONT SEAT, MOM.

496
00:19:04,851 --> 00:19:07,812
I SIT IN THE FRONT SEAT NOW.

497
00:19:07,812 --> 00:19:09,022
HMM?

498
00:19:11,983 --> 00:19:14,694
- LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING, 
MICHAEL.

499
00:19:14,694 --> 00:19:17,113
YOU HAVE TO FIGHT 
FOR YOUR FAMILY.

500
00:19:17,113 --> 00:19:19,073
IF YOU WERE SMART, 
YOU'D GRAB YOUR SON

501
00:19:19,073 --> 00:19:21,618
BEFORE HE SLIPS 
ANY FURTHER AWAY.

502
00:19:21,618 --> 00:19:23,495
- WELL, I DISAGREE, MOM.

503
00:19:23,495 --> 00:19:25,580
I'M NOT GONNA CONTROL 
GEORGE MICHAEL.

504
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:28,041
I'M GONNA LET HIM 
DECIDE FOR HIMSELF WHAT'S BEST.

505
00:19:28,041 --> 00:19:30,752
- MM-HMM, WELL,

00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:50,939

00:20:01,991 --> 00:20:05,245
WITH THE BOY 
HE ALMOST HAD TO KISS.

WHAT I SAID AT THE SCHOOL.

522
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:37,402
IT WAS OUT OF LINE.

523

MY NOSE INTO YOUR LIFE.

529
00:20:50,374 --> 00:20:52,459

530
00:20:52,459 --> 00:20:54,794

531
00:20:56,671 --> 00:20:59,007
