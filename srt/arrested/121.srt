00:00:01,417 --> 00:00:02,877
male narrator: NOW THE STORY 
OF A WEALTHY FAMILY

2
00:00:02,877 --> 00:00:03,919
WHO LOST EVERYTHING

3
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:06,089
AND THE ONE SON 
WHO HAD NO CHOICE

4
00:00:06,089 --> 00:00:09,092
BUT TO KEEP THEM ALL TOGETHER.

5
00:00:13,596 --> 00:00:16,599
IT'S "ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT."

6
00:00:18,809 --> 00:00:22,063
MICHAEL WAS HEADING OFF TO WORK 
WHEN HIS SON, GEORGE MICHAEL,

7
00:00:22,063 --> 00:00:24,315
REMINDED HIM 
OF A YEARLY TRADITION.

8
00:00:24,315 --> 00:00:26,567
- HEY, DON'T FORGET ME. 
- FOR WHAT?

9
00:00:26,567 --> 00:00:27,985
- IT'S BRING YOUR DAUGHTER 
TO WORK DAY.

10
00:00:27,985 --> 00:00:29,570
AND UNLESS YOU HAD A DAUGHTER 
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT,

11
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:30,905
I'M YOUR GIRL.

12
00:00:30,905 --> 00:00:32,573
narrator: MICHAEL 
HAD FIRST MADE THIS JOKE

13
00:00:32,573 --> 00:00:34,075
WHEN GEORGE MICHAEL WAS SIX.

14
00:00:34,075 --> 00:00:35,701
- WELL, SHE'S NOT MY DAUGHTER,

15
00:00:35,701 --> 00:00:37,953
BUT IT'S ABOUT AS CLOSE 
AS I'M GONNA GET.

16
00:00:37,953 --> 00:00:39,997
- I'M A GOOD LITTLE GIRL.

17
00:00:39,997 --> 00:00:41,291
narrator: IT WAS A JOKE 
MICHAEL WAS STARTING

18
00:00:41,291 --> 00:00:44,669
TO GROW CONCERNED ABOUT AS IT 
HAD NOT WORN WELL WITH AGE.

19
00:00:44,669 --> 00:00:46,003
- HEY, DAD.

20
00:00:46,003 --> 00:00:48,839
THEY'RE OUT OF SANITARY NAPKINS 
IN THE LADIES' WASHROOM.

21
00:00:48,839 --> 00:00:51,842
[laughing]

22
00:00:51,842 --> 00:00:53,178
- WEIRD KID.

23
00:00:53,178 --> 00:00:54,637
- I DON'T THINK THIS YEAR'S 
SUCH A GOOD IDEA.

24
00:00:54,637 --> 00:00:56,013
YOU KNOW, 
YOU'RE GETTING OLDER AND--

25
00:00:56,013 --> 00:00:57,014
- YEAH, RIGHT, PRETTY SOON

26
00:00:57,014 --> 00:00:58,474
I'M GOING TO 
HAVE TO START WEARING A BRA.

27
00:00:58,474 --> 00:01:00,310
RIGHT, DAD? 
ALL RIGHT, GIVE ME ONE MINUTE.

28
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:02,853
- REALLY, LET'S NOT THIS YEAR.

29
00:01:02,853 --> 00:01:05,190
I CANNOT KILL THIS JOKE.

30
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:06,649
HEY, SHOULDN'T YOU 
BE GETTING DRESSED?

31
00:01:06,649 --> 00:01:09,194
- NOPE, GOING WITH MY DAD 
TO WORK TODAY.

32
00:01:09,194 --> 00:01:10,945
- HEY, PEANUT BUTTER CUP.

33
00:01:10,945 --> 00:01:12,822
- THIS IS WORK? 
WATCHING ENTERTAINMENT NEWS?

34
00:01:12,822 --> 00:01:13,989
- WELL, EXCUSE ME, MICHAEL,

35
00:01:13,989 --> 00:01:16,451
FOR NOT RAISING THE PERFECT 
DAUGHTER THAT YOU DID.

36
00:01:16,451 --> 00:01:19,454
I INDULGED THIS RITUAL 
FOR YEARS IN BOSTON.

37
00:01:19,454 --> 00:01:20,538
narrator: 
AS A PSYCHOTHERAPIST,

38
00:01:20,538 --> 00:01:23,208
TOBIAS WAS ON THE FOREFRONT 
OF THE SELF-ESTEEM MOVEMENT.

39
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:27,462
- BUT THERE'S, LIKE, 
THIS LONGING, THIS PULL.

40
00:01:27,462 --> 00:01:30,465
I MEAN, DOES THAT MAKE ME, 
YOU KNOW, LIKE SOME KIND OF--

41
00:01:30,465 --> 00:01:35,261
- HOMOSEXUAL. 
- MAEBY, PLEASE.

42
00:01:35,261 --> 00:01:40,057
- SHE'S RIGHT, THOUGH. 
YOU PROBABLY ARE A HOMOSEXUAL.

43
00:01:40,057 --> 00:01:41,309
- SO, MAEBY, THIS IS WHAT 
YOU'RE GONNA DO THIS YEAR?

44
00:01:41,309 --> 00:01:43,811
YOU'RE GONNA WATCH HIM WATCH TV?

45
00:01:43,811 --> 00:01:44,895
- [snoring]

46
00:01:44,895 --> 00:01:46,856
- OH, BLESS HER.

47
00:01:46,856 --> 00:01:49,484
IT'S LIKE SHE KNEW 
WHAT I WAS GOING TO DO NEXT.

48
00:01:49,484 --> 00:01:50,901
- IT'S HERE!

49
00:01:50,901 --> 00:01:53,863
"GIRLS WITH LOW SELF-ESTEEM: 
NEWPORT BEACH."

50
00:01:53,863 --> 00:01:56,949
FROM THE ACT I DID 
ON THE BEACH OVER SPRING BREAK.

51
00:01:56,949 --> 00:01:58,993
- narrator: GOB HAD 
RECENTLY DONE A MAGIC SHOW

52
00:01:58,993 --> 00:02:02,747
WHERE HE HAD MADE THE BLUTH 
FAMILY YACHT DISAPPEAR.

53
00:02:02,747 --> 00:02:05,250
IT WAS SPRING BREAK, 
AND THE ACT WAS FILMED

54
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:10,630
FOR THE POPULAR VIDEO SERIES, 
"GIRLS WITH LOW SELF-ESTEEM."

55
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:13,591
- THIS PUTS ME BACK ON TOP 
OF THE OLD MAGIC CAREER, THOUGH.

56
00:02:13,591 --> 00:02:14,800
- HANG ON, GOB, 
YOU'RE NOT GONNA PUT THAT IN.

57
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,801
THERE'S NUDITY ON THAT.

58
00:02:15,801 --> 00:02:17,637
MAEBY, WHY DON'T YOU GO 
UPSTAIRS AND GET DRESSED?

59
00:02:17,637 --> 00:02:18,638
- I MUST WARN YOU, MICHAEL.

60
00:02:18,638 --> 00:02:21,098
SHE DOESN'T RESPOND WELL 
TO STRICT DIRECTIVES.

61
00:02:21,098 --> 00:02:23,434
- ALL RIGHT.

62
00:02:23,434 --> 00:02:24,727
- THAT WAS ODD.

63
00:02:24,727 --> 00:02:26,271
- NOT REALLY. 
KIDS LOVE BOUNDARIES.

64
00:02:26,271 --> 00:02:28,022
I MEAN, LOOK AT THESE GIRLS. 
IS THIS WHAT YOU WANT?

65
00:02:28,022 --> 00:02:29,106
- OH, GOD, NO.

66
00:02:29,106 --> 00:02:30,941
- 'CAUSE THIS COULD BE 
WHERE YOUR DAUGHTER IS HEADED.

67
00:02:30,941 --> 00:02:31,942
- OH, NO, NO.

68
00:02:31,942 --> 00:02:33,319
I DON'T WANT THIS 
FOR MAEBY EITHER, NO.

69
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:35,029
- OH, HERE IT IS. 
HERE IT IS.

70
00:02:35,029 --> 00:02:36,947
- IT WAS A WILD TIME 
ON THE BEACH,

71
00:02:36,947 --> 00:02:41,369
AND IF YOU LIKE MAGIC, 
LOOK AWAY.

72
00:02:41,369 --> 00:02:45,956
THE ONLY THING THIS GUY COULD 
MAKE FLY AWAY WAS THE CROWD.

73
00:02:45,956 --> 00:02:48,293
- DOUCHE CHILL.

74
00:02:48,293 --> 00:02:51,128
- I CAN'T BELIEVE 
THEY USED THAT PART.

75
00:02:51,128 --> 00:02:53,005
THE ONE PART 
WHERE I SCREW UP.

76
00:02:53,005 --> 00:02:54,006
IT'S NOT LIKE 
THEY USED THE PART

77
00:02:54,006 --> 00:02:55,633
WHERE I MADE 
THE YACHT DISAPPEAR.

78
00:02:55,633 --> 00:02:58,177
- SUNK THE YACHT. 
BLEW IT UP, SUNK IT.

79
00:02:58,177 --> 00:03:00,305
- WE SURE DID. 
- WE? NO.

80
00:03:00,305 --> 00:03:01,889
I GAVE YOU PERMISSION 
TO USE THE YACHT.

81
00:03:01,889 --> 00:03:02,932
YOU BLEW IT UP.

82
00:03:02,932 --> 00:03:04,099
- YEAH, WELL, IF YOU GIVE 
SOMEONE PERMISSION

83
00:03:04,099 --> 00:03:07,728
TO USE A TISSUE, YOU CAN'T BE 
UPSET IF THEY BLOW THEIR NOSE.

84
00:03:07,728 --> 00:03:09,021
RIGHT? 
I MEAN, RIGHT?

85
00:03:09,021 --> 00:03:11,524
- [snoring]

86
00:03:11,524 --> 00:03:12,692
- LINDSAY, NEW OUTFIT?

87
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:14,109
- THIS? 
NO, I'VE HAD THIS FOR YEARS.

88
00:03:14,109 --> 00:03:15,570
I THINK IT'S 
A HAND-ME-DOWN FROM MOM.

89
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:17,822
- GOT A PRICE TAG RIGHT THERE. 
- IS THERE?

90
00:03:17,822 --> 00:03:19,990
OH, I GUESS SHE WANTED ME 
TO HAVE SOMETHING NEW.

91
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:21,534
SWEET OLD THING.

92
00:03:21,534 --> 00:03:23,160
- ONLY TWO OF THOSE WORDS 
DESCRIBE MOM,

93
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,870
SO I KNOW 
YOU'RE LYING TO ME.

94
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:27,206
- FINE, I BOUGHT IT 
BEFORE WE WENT BROKE, OKAY?

95
00:03:27,206 --> 00:03:29,375
I JUST HAVEN'T WORN IT YET.

96
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:31,210
- WHAT ABOUT 
THE OUTFIT YESTERDAY?

97
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:33,087
- OLD THING GAVE IT TO ME.

98
00:03:33,087 --> 00:03:34,297
- WHERE ARE YOU 
GETTING ALL THE MONEY?

99
00:03:34,297 --> 00:03:36,341
- IT'S NOT COSTING YOU ANYTHING, 
MICHAEL.

100
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:38,133
- UNLESS YOU'RE STEALING OR 
WORKING, I'M PRETTY SURE IT IS.

101
00:03:38,133 --> 00:03:39,802
- THAT'S RIGHT. 
I STOLE IT.

102
00:03:39,802 --> 00:03:41,887
narrator: IN FACT, LINDSAY, 
TIRED OF WEARING

103
00:03:41,887 --> 00:03:45,182
LAST YEAR'S FASHIONS, WENT TO 
AN UPSCALE DEPARTMENT STORE

104
00:03:45,182 --> 00:03:47,768
AND, IN A MOMENT OF DESPERATION, 
APPLIED FOR A JOB.

105
00:03:47,768 --> 00:03:49,270
- CAN I HAVE 
A JOB APPLICATION, PLEASE?

106
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:51,647
narrator: BUT SHE WAS ASHAMED 
OF BEING A SHOPGIRL

107
00:03:51,647 --> 00:03:54,275
AND WAS RELIEVED WHEN MICHAEL 
GAVE HER THE OUT.

108
00:03:54,275 --> 00:03:55,985
- WELL, THEY EXPECT A CERTAIN 
AMOUNT OF THEFT, MICHAEL.

109
00:03:55,985 --> 00:03:57,194
IT'S BUILT INTO THE PRICE.

110
00:03:57,194 --> 00:03:58,195
IF I DIDN'T TAKE IT,

111
00:03:58,195 --> 00:03:59,822
THEN PEOPLE WOULD BE 
OVERPAYING FOR NOTHING.

112
00:03:59,822 --> 00:04:01,574
- SO YOU'RE TELLING ME THAT YOU 
WALKED INTO A STORE

113
00:04:01,574 --> 00:04:04,369
AND, WITHOUT ANYONE NOTICING, 
TOOK AN ENTIRE OUTFIT?

114
00:04:04,369 --> 00:04:06,954
THERE'S NO WAY THAT YOU COULD 
DO SLEIGHT-OF-HAND THAT WELL.

115
00:04:06,954 --> 00:04:08,414
I DON'T EVEN THINK 
THAT I COULD DO IT.

116
00:04:08,414 --> 00:04:09,999
- YEAH, I'VE SEEN YOUR TAPE.

117
00:04:09,999 --> 00:04:12,084
LINDSAY, THIS IS APPALLING.

118
00:04:12,084 --> 00:04:13,711
- WHAT'D YOU USE 
FOR MISDIRECTION?

119
00:04:13,711 --> 00:04:15,212
- MISDIRECTION?

120
00:04:15,212 --> 00:04:17,257
- YEAH, I MEAN, 
IF YOU'RE SO GOOD AT MAGIC,

121
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:19,967
WHAT'D YOU HAVE THEM LOOKING AT 
TO DIVERT THEIR ATTENTION?

122
00:04:19,967 --> 00:04:22,136
- I DON'T KNOW-- 
MY ASS.

123
00:04:22,136 --> 00:04:24,305
- MY ASS; YOU'RE LYING. 
- NO, I'M NOT.

124
00:04:24,305 --> 00:04:26,641
- YOU'RE GONNA TAKE THAT BACK. 
- NO, I'M NOT.

125
00:04:26,641 --> 00:04:29,310
THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH YOU. 
YOU'RE NOT MY FATHER.

126
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:31,646
- NO, OUR FATHER IS IN PRISON 
FOR STEALING, REMEMBER?

127
00:04:31,646 --> 00:04:33,439
WHICH MIGHT NOT BE A BAD PLACE 
FOR YOU TO GET USED TO.

128
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:35,775
- MICHAEL, IT WAS SHOPLIFTING, 
AND I'M WHITE.

129
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:37,318
I THINK I'M GOING TO BE OKAY.

130
00:04:37,318 --> 00:04:39,320
- SHOPLIFTING? 
COOL, CAN YOU TAKE ME?

131
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:41,822
- NO, HEY, NOT COOL. 
YOU KNOW WHAT?

132
00:04:41,822 --> 00:04:43,991
MAEBY, YOU'RE GONNA 
COME WITH ME TO WORK TODAY.

133
00:04:43,991 --> 00:04:45,368
YOU'RE GONNA BE MY DAUGHTER.

134
00:04:45,368 --> 00:04:47,287
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE A ROLE MODEL 
IN YOUR LIFE WHO IS HONEST,

135
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:49,830
WHO DOESN'T STEAL, 
DOESN'T LIE, AND, I DON'T KNOW,

136
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:53,793
WATCH ENTERTAINMENT NEWS.

137
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:55,210
- MICHAEL, 
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT, OKAY?

138
00:04:55,210 --> 00:04:56,421
SHE'S NOT GONNA GO WITH YOU.

139
00:04:56,421 --> 00:04:58,047
- OKAY. 
- GREAT.

140
00:04:58,047 --> 00:04:59,048
- THAT WAS ODD.

141
00:04:59,048 --> 00:05:00,841
- I'M GOING TO TEACH YOU TWO 
A LITTLE SOMETHING

142
00:05:00,841 --> 00:05:03,469
ABOUT HANDS-ON PARENTING.

143
00:05:03,469 --> 00:05:04,637
- HEY, DAD!

144
00:05:04,637 --> 00:05:08,308
DO YOU THINK THIS PURSE 
GOES WITH THIS OUTFIT?

145
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:12,520
WHERE'D MY DAD GO? 
- DOUCHE CHILL.

146
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,271
narrator: 
AND SO MICHAEL TOOK HIS NIECE

147
00:05:14,271 --> 00:05:15,731
TO BRING YOUR DAUGHTER 
TO WORK DAY.

148
00:05:15,731 --> 00:05:17,483
- UH, YOU CAN JUST DROP ME OFF 
AT THE MALL.

149
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:20,110
- OH, NO, YOU'RE-- 
YOU'RE REALLY COMING WITH ME.

150
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:24,281
YOU'RE GONNA LEARN A LITTLE 
SOMETHING ABOUT HARD WORK.

151
00:05:24,281 --> 00:05:25,616
HEY, MAEBY! 
MAEBY!

152
00:05:25,616 --> 00:05:26,617
[tires screeching]

153
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:31,581
- OKAY, SO YOU CAN 
RUN FASTER THAN ME.

154
00:05:31,581 --> 00:05:33,290
BUT YOU CAN'T MAKE ME WORK.

155
00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:35,042
- NO ONE'S MAKING YOU 
DO ANYTHING, YOU KNOW.

156
00:05:35,042 --> 00:05:37,420
IT'S JUST A CHANCE FOR US 
TO SPEND SOME TIME TOGETHER.

157
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:38,879
LEARN ABOUT BUSINESS.

158
00:05:38,879 --> 00:05:40,881
YOU KNOW, YOU MIGHT FIND 
THAT YOU'RE GOOD AT THINGS

159
00:05:40,881 --> 00:05:44,969
YOU DIDN'T EVEN KNOW ABOUT.

160
00:05:46,178 --> 00:05:47,346
SEE THAT?

161
00:05:47,346 --> 00:05:49,682
WHO KNEW YOU WERE 
SUCH A GOOD LITTLE CLIMBER?

162
00:05:49,682 --> 00:05:51,601
NOW LISTEN, 
LET'S MAKE THIS FUN, OKAY?

163
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:52,602
[cell phone ringing]

164
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:53,603
WE'RE FAMILY.

165
00:05:53,603 --> 00:05:56,146
WHAT IS BETTER THAN 
HANGING OUT WITH FAMILY, HMM?

166
00:05:56,146 --> 00:05:58,023
OH--IT'S MY MOTHER.

167
00:05:58,023 --> 00:05:59,024
[phone beeps]

168
00:05:59,024 --> 00:06:01,068
HI. 
- SHE CALLED YOU, HUH?

169
00:06:01,068 --> 00:06:03,153
I GUESS I'M NOT GOOD ENOUGH 
TO BE HER HUSBAND.

170
00:06:03,153 --> 00:06:05,114
- WHAT? 
WHAT'S GOING ON?

171
00:06:05,114 --> 00:06:06,115
- OKAY.

172
00:06:06,115 --> 00:06:08,659
MOTHER WANTS SOMEONE TO GO 
TO MY SOCCER GAME WITH.

173
00:06:08,659 --> 00:06:10,119
SHE DON'T WANT 
OTHER SOCCER MOMS TO THINK

174
00:06:10,119 --> 00:06:11,829
THAT SHE A SINGLE MOTHER.

175
00:06:11,829 --> 00:06:13,498
SHE OLD SCHOOL.

176
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:15,458
- I LIKED IT BETTER 
WHEN HE JUST SAID ANNYONG.

177
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:17,835
HEY, MOM, WHY CAN'T BUSTER 
PRETEND TO BE YOUR ESCORT?

178
00:06:17,835 --> 00:06:19,378
THAT'S THE WAY HE'S GOT IT 
IN ALL HIS CARTOONS.

179
00:06:19,378 --> 00:06:21,088
- THEY ALREADY KNOW HE'S MY SON.

180
00:06:21,088 --> 00:06:22,339
- I WOULDN'T GO 
EVEN IF YOU ASKED.

181
00:06:22,339 --> 00:06:23,674
YOU DIDN'T LET ME PLAY SOCCER 
AS A CHILD.

182
00:06:23,674 --> 00:06:25,259
WHY SHOULD I HAVE TO SIT 
AND CHEER ANNYONG?

183
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:26,886
ANNYONG NEVER CHEERS ME.

184
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:28,095
- GO, FATTY.

185
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:30,347
- [grunting, crashing]

186
00:06:30,347 --> 00:06:32,975
- STOP IT! 
HE'S YOUR LITTLE BROTHER!

187
00:06:32,975 --> 00:06:33,976
- NO, HE'S NOT!

188
00:06:33,976 --> 00:06:35,645
I CAME OUT OF YOU! 
HE DIDN'T!

189
00:06:35,645 --> 00:06:38,313
- CAN YOU NOT CALL ME WITH 
THESE LITTLE THINGS, PLEASE?

190
00:06:38,313 --> 00:06:41,066
THE OFFICE IS A MESS. 
I STILL HAVEN'T REPLACED KITTY.

191
00:06:41,066 --> 00:06:42,359
narrator: 
MICHAEL HAD RECENTLY FIRED

192
00:06:42,359 --> 00:06:43,402
HIS FATHER'S 
LONGTIME ASSISTANT, KITTY.

193
00:06:43,402 --> 00:06:44,945
- DID YOU HEAR THAT EVERYONE?

194
00:06:44,945 --> 00:06:47,573
MICHAEL BLUTH IS THREATENING ME! 
- SHH, SHH, SHH.

195
00:06:47,573 --> 00:06:49,450
narrator: 
IT HAD NOT BEEN A CLEAN BREAK.

196
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:50,451
- SO, I'VE GOT 
A LOT OF WORK TO DO.

197
00:06:50,451 --> 00:06:52,286
PLUS, IT'S BRING 
YOUR DAUGHTER TO WORK DAY.

198
00:06:52,286 --> 00:06:54,789
- OH, WHERE IS GEORGE MICHAEL? 
- I TOLD HIM NOT TO COME.

199
00:06:54,789 --> 00:06:58,292
I-I THOUGHT IT WAS MORE 
IMPORTANT TO BRING MAEBY THIS--

200
00:06:58,292 --> 00:07:00,419
[both grunting]

201
00:07:00,419 --> 00:07:02,630
DAMN IT, CAN YOU JUST 
FIND SOMEBODY ELSE, PLEASE,

202
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:04,089
TO LOOK LIKE YOUR HUSBAND?

203
00:07:04,089 --> 00:07:05,925
narrator: 
IN FACT, THERE WAS SOMEONE ELSE

204
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:07,718
WHO LOOKED LIKE 
LUCILLE'S HUSBAND--

205
00:07:07,718 --> 00:07:09,219
HIS TWIN BROTHER, OSCAR.

206
00:07:09,219 --> 00:07:10,220
- LUCILLE.

207
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:11,806
narrator: AND ALTHOUGH 
SHE KNEW IT WAS WRONG

208
00:07:11,806 --> 00:07:12,973
TO PLAY WITH HIS HEART--

209
00:07:12,973 --> 00:07:14,767
- OSCAR, IT'S LUCILLE.

210
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:17,352
narrator: SHE REALLY DIDN'T WANT 
TO GO TO THE SOCCER GAME ALONE.

211
00:07:17,352 --> 00:07:20,272
- [speaking softly] 
I NEED YOU.

212
00:07:20,272 --> 00:07:21,398
[grunting]

213
00:07:21,398 --> 00:07:22,942
narrator: 
AND BACK AT THE MODEL HOME,

214
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:25,945
THREE OF THE BLUTH MEN 
STRUGGLED WITH THEIR MANLINESS.

215
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:26,946
- YOU KNOW, I MEAN, 
I MAKE THESE JOKES

216
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:29,156
ABOUT BEING A DAUGHTER 
FOR MY DAD.

217
00:07:29,156 --> 00:07:31,158
AND I KNOW I'M A MAN. 
IT'S HIS INSECURITY, NOT MINE.

218
00:07:31,158 --> 00:07:32,452
- THERE'S NO SECURITY 
AT THAT STORE.

219
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:34,328
THAT'S HOW 
SHE WAS ABLE TO SHOPLIFT.

220
00:07:34,328 --> 00:07:36,664
PROBABLY DON'T EVEN HAVE 
A REGULAR SECURITY GUARD.

221
00:07:36,664 --> 00:07:39,875
- WELL, OF COURSE I COULD GET 
A JOB AS A SECURITY GUARD.

222
00:07:39,875 --> 00:07:42,294
I MEAN, IF I HAVE TO HAVE 
A JOB TO IMPRESS MY DAUGHTER.

223
00:07:42,294 --> 00:07:44,129
IF SHE NEEDS 
SOMETHING THAT BUTCH.

224
00:07:44,129 --> 00:07:45,923
- YEAH. 
I CAN HANG OUT WITH MY UNCLES.

225
00:07:45,923 --> 00:07:47,717
I MEAN, THREE MEN. 
WHAT'S BUTCHER THAN THAT?

226
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:50,427
- I'M GOING TO THE MALL. 
- ME TOO.

227
00:07:50,427 --> 00:07:53,514
- YEAH, MAYBE A NEW PAIR 
OF SHOES WILL CHEER ME UP.

228
00:07:53,514 --> 00:07:55,641
- AND NOW I'M FILLING OUT 
AN EXPENSE REPORT,

229
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:59,854
SO I CAN SLEEP WELL AT NIGHT, 
KNOWING THAT I HAVE BEEN HONEST.

230
00:07:59,854 --> 00:08:00,980
YOU'RE NOT ASLEEP.

231
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:02,857
- I WAS. 
- YOU WERE NOT.

232
00:08:02,857 --> 00:08:04,525
- YOU KNOW, I WOULD LIKE TO SEE 
IF YOU COULD GO ONE DAY

233
00:08:04,525 --> 00:08:05,860
WITHOUT TELLING A LIE.

234
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:08,738
JUST ONE WHOLE DAY 
WITHOUT BEING LIKE YOUR MOM.

235
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:12,324
- WHAT'S IN IT FOR ME IF I DO? 
- YOU'LL WIN MY RESPECT.

236
00:08:12,324 --> 00:08:14,827
- GOOD NIGHT. 
- AND 50 BUCKS.

237
00:08:14,827 --> 00:08:17,538
- FINE. 
I'LL DO IT IF YOU DO IT.

238
00:08:17,538 --> 00:08:20,165
- THAT-A-GIRL. 
THIS IS GONNA BE FUN.

239
00:08:20,165 --> 00:08:21,917
- I WIN.

240
00:08:21,917 --> 00:08:24,128
- WE'RE LOOKING 
FOR MICHAEL BLUTH?

241
00:08:24,128 --> 00:08:25,838
- THAT'S ME. 
I'M MICHAEL BLUTH.

242
00:08:25,838 --> 00:08:28,382
- I'M OFFICER TAYLOR. 
THIS IS OFFICER CARTER.

243
00:08:28,382 --> 00:08:30,050
OUR DAUGHTERS, 
TAMMY AND MONI--

244
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:32,177
OH, GOD, WHAT-- 
WHERE DID THEY GO?

245
00:08:32,177 --> 00:08:33,178
- I'M ON IT.

246
00:08:33,178 --> 00:08:34,388
- HOW CAN I HELP YOU?

247
00:08:34,388 --> 00:08:35,515
- WELL, WE'RE HERE INVESTIGATING

248
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:37,767
THE DISAPPEARANCE 
OF KITTY SANCHEZ.

249
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:43,313
APPARENTLY, YOU'RE THE LAST 
PERSON TO SEE HER...ALIVE...

250
00:08:43,313 --> 00:08:45,107
OR AROUND TOWN OR WHATEVER.

251
00:08:45,107 --> 00:08:46,609
- I DON'T KNOW 
ANYTHING ABOUT THAT.

252
00:08:46,609 --> 00:08:47,860
I-I DO KNOW THAT, UH,

253
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:50,988
SHE WAS MY SECRETARY, 
UH, BUT SHE LEFT.

254
00:08:50,988 --> 00:08:53,157
OR I-I FIRED HER.

255
00:08:53,157 --> 00:08:54,909
- DID YOU EVER THREATEN HER?

256
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:56,827
- NO, NO, GOD, NO. 
OF COURSE NOT.

257
00:08:56,827 --> 00:08:59,163
- MICHAEL BLUTH 
IS THREATENING ME!

258
00:08:59,163 --> 00:09:01,957
- I DID--I THREATENED HER 
AT A RESTAURANT.

259
00:09:01,957 --> 00:09:06,503
BUT, YOU KNOW 
IT'S A RESTAURANT, SO...

260
00:09:06,503 --> 00:09:08,380
- YEP.

261
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:10,090
- CERTAINLY SHE'S 
BEEN SEEN SINCE THEN?

262
00:09:10,090 --> 00:09:13,093
- NOT ALIVE...

263
00:09:13,093 --> 00:09:15,387
OR DEAD OR WHATEVER.

264
00:09:15,387 --> 00:09:17,347
WE'D LOVE TO SPEAK WITH YOU 
DOWN AT THE STATION.

265
00:09:17,347 --> 00:09:20,685
- SURE, UH, YOU KNOW, 
I-I-I'M HAPPY TO COOPERATE,

266
00:09:20,685 --> 00:09:23,312
BUT I REALLY DON'T KNOW 
ANYTHING MORE THAN YOU KNOW.

267
00:09:23,312 --> 00:09:25,022
I CERTAINLY DIDN'T-- 
DIDN'T KILL HER

268
00:09:25,022 --> 00:09:28,651
AND DROP HER IN A BACK BAY.

269
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:30,194
BOY, I HOPE THAT'S 
NOT WHAT HAPPENED TO HER.

270
00:09:30,194 --> 00:09:32,529
- I'M SURE IT ISN'T.

271
00:09:32,529 --> 00:09:35,324
PLEASE SEND OFFICER DAVIS AND 
LITTLE HANNA TO THE BACK BAY.

272
00:09:35,324 --> 00:09:37,492
- SO YOU KILLED KITTY, HUH?

273
00:09:37,492 --> 00:09:39,036
- NO, I DIDN'T KILL KITTY.

274
00:09:39,036 --> 00:09:40,537
BUT I WILL GO DOWN 
TO THE STATION

275
00:09:40,537 --> 00:09:41,872
AND ANSWER 
THOSE NICE MEN'S QUESTIONS.

276
00:09:41,872 --> 00:09:43,040
YOU KNOW WHY?

277
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,333
'CAUSE I HAVE 
NO SECRETS TO HIDE,

278
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:46,001
BECAUSE I'M AN HONEST MAN.

279
00:09:46,001 --> 00:09:47,002
[laughter]

280
00:09:47,002 --> 00:09:48,212
AND APPARENTLY A FUN ONE.

281
00:09:48,212 --> 00:09:50,255
LET'S GO SEE WHAT'S 
GOING ON IN THE BACK ROOM.

282
00:09:50,255 --> 00:09:53,092
- WERE THOSE THE LAST WORDS 
KITTY EVER HEARD?

283
00:09:53,092 --> 00:09:55,344
- NO, I WILL NOT KISS HER.

284
00:09:55,344 --> 00:09:57,387
- HEY, HEY, GUYS, 
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

285
00:09:57,387 --> 00:09:59,765
IT'S BRING 
YOUR DAUGHTER TO WORK DAY.

286
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:01,100
- YEAH, THAT'S MY CAITLIN.

287
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,935
- OKAY. 
THERE IS WORK TO BE DONE.

288
00:10:02,935 --> 00:10:04,854
CAN WE GET BACK TO IT? 
THANK YOU.

289
00:10:04,854 --> 00:10:08,941
OH, AND HAS ANYBODY, UH, 
SEEN OR HEARD FROM KITTY LATELY?

290
00:10:08,941 --> 00:10:13,696
- I THINK THAT'S HER 
RIGHT BEHIND YOU THERE.

291
00:10:13,696 --> 00:10:14,947
- OH, MY GOD. 
THAT IS KITTY.

292
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:17,742
- AND THAT'S THE BOAT 
THAT UNCLE GOB BLEW UP.

293
00:10:17,742 --> 00:10:20,786
HEY, NOW YOU HAVE SOMETHING 
TO TELL THEM AT THE STATION.

294
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:29,169
narrator: TOBIAS SOUGHT OUT 
A SECURITY POSITION

295
00:10:29,169 --> 00:10:30,212
AT THE NEARBY MALL.

296
00:10:30,212 --> 00:10:33,048
- I DO KNOW STAGE COMBAT 
IF THE PARTNER IS WILLING

297
00:10:33,048 --> 00:10:35,425
AND A BIT MORE PETITE THAN I.

298
00:10:35,425 --> 00:10:39,722
BUT I HAVE A DAUGHTER 
TO IMPRESS, AND I NEED THIS JOB.

299
00:10:39,722 --> 00:10:41,766
- WELL, IT'S GONNA BE 
A COUPLE OF DAYS

300
00:10:41,766 --> 00:10:43,893
BEFORE WE CAN 
GET YOU A GUN LICENSE,

301
00:10:43,893 --> 00:10:47,647
SO YOU'LL HAVE TO USE MINE.

302
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:49,356
- WOW! 
[chuckles]

303
00:10:49,356 --> 00:10:51,233
narrator: MEANWHILE, 
GOB HAD TAKEN GEORGE MICHAEL

304
00:10:51,233 --> 00:10:52,484
ON A MYSTERIOUS ERRAND.

305
00:10:52,484 --> 00:10:53,485
- WHAT ARE WE GETTING?

306
00:10:53,485 --> 00:10:55,237
IS IT SOMETHING 
FOR A MAGIC TRICK?

307
00:10:55,237 --> 00:10:57,489
- IN A WAY. 
- THAT'S COOL.

308
00:10:57,489 --> 00:11:00,159
YOU KNOW, IT'S SO GREAT 
TO BE HANGING OUT WITH YOU.

309
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:02,119
THERE ARE CERTAIN THINGS 
THAT I CAN TALK TO YOU ABOUT

310
00:11:02,119 --> 00:11:03,663
THAT I CAN'T REALLY WITH MY DAD.

311
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:07,708
LIKE, UH, WERE--WERE YOU EVER 
AWKWARD AROUND GIRLS?

312
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:09,418
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

313
00:11:09,418 --> 00:11:10,419
LIKE IF THERE WERE 
THREE OF US

314
00:11:10,419 --> 00:11:11,420
AND I DIDN'T 
KNOW WHERE TO START?

315
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:13,297
NO, I THINK 
I DID PRETTY WELL.

316
00:11:13,297 --> 00:11:14,298
- [chuckles]

317
00:11:14,298 --> 00:11:15,507
- NOT A LOT OF COMPLAINTS, 
IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

318
00:11:15,507 --> 00:11:17,718
AT LEAST NOT FROM THE GIRL.

319
00:11:17,718 --> 00:11:19,511
- YOU'RE SAYING 
I SHOULD JUST BE MYSELF?

320
00:11:19,511 --> 00:11:20,512
- AND HE HAD TO DRIVE HER HOME.

321
00:11:20,512 --> 00:11:23,766
SO I THINK I DID PRETTY GOOD. 
PRETTY DAMN GOOD.

322
00:11:23,766 --> 00:11:25,184
HEY, GUY. 
- YES, SIR?

323
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:29,479
- HOW MANY MICE WILL $13 BUY?

324
00:11:29,479 --> 00:11:31,899
narrator: AND AT THE PRISON, 
GEORGE SR. HAD A SURPRISE VISIT.

325
00:11:31,899 --> 00:11:34,318
- I JUST WANTED TO CHECK IN 
AND MAKE SURE YOU'RE AWARE

326
00:11:34,318 --> 00:11:36,445
THAT YOUR BAN ON ORGANIZED 
SPORTS IN THIS FAMILY

327
00:11:36,445 --> 00:11:38,030
HAS BEEN VIOLATED.

328
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:40,157
- A BAN ON ORGANIZED SPORTS?

329
00:11:40,157 --> 00:11:42,201
- YOU KNOW, HOW YOU WOULDN'T 
LET ME SIGN UP FOR ANYTHING

330
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:43,285
WHEN I WAS A KID.

331
00:11:43,285 --> 00:11:45,120
- IS THAT WHAT YOU'VE BEEN 
THINKING ALL THESE YEARS?

332
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,163
NO, NO.

333
00:11:46,163 --> 00:11:48,457
YOU WERE--YOU WERE JUST A TURD 
OUT THERE, YOU KNOW?

334
00:11:48,457 --> 00:11:50,125
YOU COULDN'T KICK 
AND YOU COULDN'T RUN.

335
00:11:50,125 --> 00:11:53,503
YOU KNOW, 
YOU WERE JUST A-A TURD.

336
00:11:53,503 --> 00:11:56,173
- PRISON HAS DESTROYED 
THE WAY YOU TALK.

337
00:11:56,173 --> 00:11:58,008
IF THAT'S WHAT IT TAKES TO 
IMPRESS THESE GUYS AROUND HERE,

338
00:11:58,008 --> 00:11:59,760
THEN THEY ARE NOT YOUR FRIENDS.

339
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,762
ANYWAY, 
ANNYONG'S PLAYING SOCCER,

340
00:12:01,762 --> 00:12:03,222
BUT I GUESS I SHOULD 
JUST IGNORE IT.

341
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:05,390
LOOK THE OTHER WAY 
AS MOM AND UNCLE OSCAR

342
00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:06,558
AND ANNYONG 
HAVE THE PERFECT LITTLE FAMILY--

343
00:12:06,558 --> 00:12:08,185
- WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, 
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

344
00:12:08,185 --> 00:12:09,937
OSCAR? 
MY BROTHER, OSCAR?

345
00:12:09,937 --> 00:12:12,898
OSCAR'S BEEN COMING AROUND? 
- NO TOUCHING!

346
00:12:12,898 --> 00:12:15,025
- NO TOUCHING. 
NO TOUCHING.

347
00:12:15,025 --> 00:12:16,026
YOU LISTEN TO ME.

348
00:12:16,026 --> 00:12:17,820
YOU'VE GOT TO TAKE CARE 
OF THIS OSCAR SITUATION.

349
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:19,571
YOU GET HIM 
OUT OF THERE, ALL RIGHT?

350
00:12:19,571 --> 00:12:21,240
YOU MAKE HIM WISH 
THAT HE'D NEVER SHOWN

351
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:25,953
THAT LUDICROUS HEAD OF HAIR 
AND THAT NICE FACE OF HIS.

352
00:12:25,953 --> 00:12:28,831
- I WILL DO IT, DAD. 
- GOOD; PUT HER THERE.

353
00:12:28,831 --> 00:12:31,541
- NO TOUCHING! 
- OH!

354
00:12:31,541 --> 00:12:34,879
- HER SELF-ESTEEM 
IS THROUGH THE ROOF.

355
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:37,339
narrator: AND MICHAEL ARRIVED AT 
THE POLICE STATION WITH MAEBY.

356
00:12:37,339 --> 00:12:38,799
- I GOT HERE AS QUICKLY 
AS I COULD.

357
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:40,134
- I DIDN'T KNOW 
YOU HAD A DAUGHTER.

358
00:12:40,134 --> 00:12:41,135
- I DON'T.

359
00:12:41,135 --> 00:12:43,262
- I THOUGHT YOU WANTED ME 
TO CALL YOU DADDY?

360
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:46,348
- WHY DON'T YOU WAIT 
FOR DADDY IN THE CAR?

361
00:12:46,348 --> 00:12:48,183
ALL RIGHT. 
WHAT DO WE HAVE HERE?

362
00:12:48,183 --> 00:12:50,227
- GOB SUNK THE YACHT.

363
00:12:50,227 --> 00:12:52,354
LAST TIME KITTY WAS SEEN, 
SHE WAS GETTING ONTO IT.

364
00:12:52,354 --> 00:12:53,397
IT'S ON TAPE.

365
00:12:53,397 --> 00:12:56,066
- OOH, DID YOU SEE THIS? 
- YEP.

366
00:12:56,066 --> 00:12:59,653
- OOH! 
CHILLS.

367
00:12:59,653 --> 00:13:01,655
WHERE DO I KEEP GETTING 
THESE BRUISES?

368
00:13:01,655 --> 00:13:02,739
- BARRY!

369
00:13:02,739 --> 00:13:04,033
- OKAY, 
UNTIL WE GET ALL THE FACTS,

370
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:06,618
DON'T SAY ANYTHING 
THAT CAN INCRIMINATE YOU.

371
00:13:06,618 --> 00:13:09,288
OR ME. 
JUST TRY TO KEEP ME OUT OF THIS.

372
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:10,497
LIE. 
BOTH OF YOU.

373
00:13:10,497 --> 00:13:12,624
- NO, WHAT ARE YOU TALK-- 
WE DON'T LIE IN THIS FAMILY.

374
00:13:12,624 --> 00:13:13,918
MAEBY, WHY DON'T YOU 
GET A SODA?

375
00:13:13,918 --> 00:13:16,211
- OKAY.

376
00:13:16,211 --> 00:13:18,422
- IF I LIE IN FRONT OF HER, 
IT COSTS ME 50 BUCKS.

377
00:13:18,422 --> 00:13:21,842
I DO THINK THAT WE SHOULD LIE.

378
00:13:21,842 --> 00:13:23,343
narrator: 
MEANWHILE, LINDSAY WAS AT WORK

379
00:13:23,343 --> 00:13:24,719
AND STARTING TO GET JEALOUS

380
00:13:24,719 --> 00:13:26,471
THAT HER DAUGHTER 
WAS AT WORK WITH MICHAEL.

381
00:13:26,471 --> 00:13:27,597
- OH, HELLO, MICHAEL.

382
00:13:27,597 --> 00:13:29,683
I KNOW YOU THINK 
I'M SUCH A HORRIBLE MOTHER,

383
00:13:29,683 --> 00:13:31,977
BUT I WAS JUST SEEING HOW 
MY DAUGHTER WAS DOING AT WORK.

384
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:36,315
- UH, SHE'S, UM, SHE'S MAKING 
LOTS OF FRIENDS ALREADY.

385
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:37,983
CAN YOU HELP ME THERE, PLEASE?

386
00:13:37,983 --> 00:13:39,026
narrator: 
IT WAS AT THIS MOMENT

387
00:13:39,026 --> 00:13:41,778
THAT GOB AND GEORGE MICHAEL 
ARRIVED AT THE STORE.

388
00:13:41,778 --> 00:13:42,988
- YOU KNOW, SAY WHAT YOU WILL 
ABOUT AMERICA--

389
00:13:42,988 --> 00:13:45,282
13 BUCKS STILLS GETS 
YOU A HELL OF A LOT OF MICE.

390
00:13:45,282 --> 00:13:46,992
- WHO SAID ANYTHING BAD 
ABOUT AMERICA?

391
00:13:46,992 --> 00:13:50,162
- NO, WELL, I MEANT-- 
SO WHAT ARE THE MICE FOR?

392
00:13:50,162 --> 00:13:52,539
- OH, NO, THAT'S JUST 
FOR MISDIRECTION.

393
00:13:52,539 --> 00:13:54,041
WE'LL SEE WHO 
THE SLEIGHT-OF-HAND ARTIST IS

394
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:56,418
IN THIS FAMILY.

395
00:13:56,418 --> 00:13:59,296
OKAY, NOW, WHEN I YELL "MICE!" 
I WANT YOU TO OPEN THIS BOX,

396
00:13:59,296 --> 00:14:01,631
AND I'M GONNA START STUFFING 
SOME SHIRTS DOWN YOUR PANTS.

397
00:14:01,631 --> 00:14:04,301
- SHIRTS? 
GOB, ARE WE SHOPLIFTING?

398
00:14:04,301 --> 00:14:05,635
- MICE!

399
00:14:05,635 --> 00:14:07,972
- MICE! 
CALL SECURITY!

400
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:10,390
- MICHAEL, I'M NOT AS BAD 
AN INFLUENCE AS YOU THINK I AM.

401
00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:12,059
- WELL, YOU'RE NOT A GREAT ONE. 
YOU'RE A CRIMINAL, LINDSAY.

402
00:14:12,059 --> 00:14:13,560
WHAT KIND OF MESSAGE 
DOES THAT SEND?

403
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:16,146
- BLUTH. 
WE'RE READY TO QUESTION YOU NOW.

404
00:14:16,146 --> 00:14:18,815
- THAT'S WHAT I AM, MICHAEL. 
I'M A SHOPLIFTER!

405
00:14:18,815 --> 00:14:20,860
I'VE GOT A WHOLE BAG 
OF CLOTHES I SHOPLIFTED.

406
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,527
narrator: 
BUT TOBIAS WAS NOW A GUARD.

407
00:14:22,527 --> 00:14:24,071
- [screams]

408
00:14:24,071 --> 00:14:26,406
narrator: 
AND A SURPRISINGLY CATLIKE ONE.

409
00:14:26,406 --> 00:14:29,701
- WOW, I GUESS WE DIDN'T 
NEED THE MICE.

410
00:14:29,701 --> 00:14:34,373
- FREEZE, [bleep].

411
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:35,374
narrator: WHILE THE REST 
OF THE BLUTHS WERE

412
00:14:35,374 --> 00:14:38,543
IN POLICE CUSTODY, LUCILLE WAS 
WITH HER BROTHER-IN-LAW.

413
00:14:38,543 --> 00:14:40,295
- I AM BLOWN AWAY THAT YOU--

414
00:14:40,295 --> 00:14:42,714
THAT YOU CALLED ME 
AND THAT WE'RE--WE'RE TOGETHER.

415
00:14:42,714 --> 00:14:44,884
AND MY CAMPER MADE IT 
ALL THE WAY UP HERE.

416
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:46,135
DO YOU THINK IT'S SAFE 
OVER THERE?

417
00:14:46,135 --> 00:14:48,720
BECAUSE I ONLY HAVE 
A HANGER FOR A LOCK.

418
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:49,930
- WHAT ARE THEY GONNA TAKE,

419
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:51,974
THE ONE CAN OF COMET 
YOU'VE GOT IN THERE?

420
00:14:51,974 --> 00:14:56,979
- OH, YOUR TONGUE IS AS SHARP 
AS YOUR BODY IS STILL TAUT.

421
00:14:56,979 --> 00:14:58,605
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

422
00:14:58,605 --> 00:15:02,943
OSCAR, THIS IS A CHILDREN'S 
SOCCER GAME, NOT WOODSTOCK.

423
00:15:02,943 --> 00:15:07,697
- THAT WAS ANOTHER ERA, HUH? 
THE MUSIC AND THE POT.

424
00:15:07,697 --> 00:15:08,698
WILL YOU EXCUSE ME?

425
00:15:08,698 --> 00:15:12,995
I NEED TO GO TO MY CAMPER 
FOR JUST A QUICK SEC.

426
00:15:12,995 --> 00:15:14,829
[whistle blows]

427
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:21,295
- OPEN.

428
00:15:21,295 --> 00:15:26,300
- HEY, UNCLE. 
- HEY, BUSTER.

429
00:15:29,761 --> 00:15:31,138
NO, NO, NO.

430
00:15:31,138 --> 00:15:33,182
NO, NO, NO. 
- NO, NO, NO.

431
00:15:35,017 --> 00:15:38,395
NO! NO! NO! 
I CAME HERE TO SAY SOMETHING.

432
00:15:38,395 --> 00:15:41,690
YOU DO NOT BELONG HERE. 
MY MOTHER'S BEEN SPOKEN FOR.

433
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:44,651
YOU KNOW, I MAY NEVER HAVE 
PLAYED ORGANIZED SPORTS,

434
00:15:44,651 --> 00:15:46,361
BUT I AM A MAN.

435
00:15:46,361 --> 00:15:47,696
- BUSTER.

436
00:15:47,696 --> 00:15:51,408
- AND I'M AFRAID I'M GONNA 
HAVE TO ASK YOU TO LEAVE.

437
00:15:51,408 --> 00:15:52,909
- OKAY.

438
00:15:52,909 --> 00:15:54,744
BUT, UH, I NEVER MEANT 
TO BREAK UP YOUR FAMILY.

439
00:15:54,744 --> 00:15:56,621
YOUR MOM 
CALLED ME FOR A REASON.

440
00:15:56,621 --> 00:15:58,457
AND I DON'T THINK SHE'S HAPPY.

441
00:15:58,457 --> 00:16:02,586
- NO, SHE'S HAPPY. 
SHE'S JUST MEAN ALL THE TIME.

442
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:07,132
[moans]

443
00:16:07,132 --> 00:16:09,259
UH, NO, NO, NO, UNCLE, 
LET ME GET YOU.

444
00:16:09,259 --> 00:16:10,970
I'M A MAN.

00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:18,060
narrator: MICHAEL SUBMITTED 
TO THE DETECTIVE'S QUESTIONS.

446
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:20,062
- YOU HAVEN'T SEEN 
ANY EVIDENCE OF MS. SANCHEZ

447
00:16:20,062 --> 00:16:21,688
OR WHERE SHE MIGHT HAVE GONE?

448
00:16:21,688 --> 00:16:24,274
- I HAVE, UH, NO IDEA. 
NONE.

449
00:16:24,274 --> 00:16:28,988
- ARE YOU WILLING TO TAKE 
A POLYGRAPH TO THAT EFFECT?

450
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:31,948
- ARE YOU NUTS?

451
00:16:31,948 --> 00:16:33,367
- NOT WITHOUT A BETTER LAWYER.

452
00:16:33,367 --> 00:16:34,994
- YOU'RE HOLDING OUT ON US!

453
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:35,995
[baby crying]

454
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:38,080
FANTASTIC. 
NOW EMMA'S AWAKE.

455
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,999

LET ME TAKE CARE OF THIS.

456
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:42,417

TOO RA LOO RA LOO RA

458
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:47,381

AGAINST YOUR FATHER,

459
00:16:47,381 --> 00:16:48,715
AND YOU DIDN'T 
WANT THAT TO COME OUT.

460
00:16:48,715 --> 00:16:50,634
BUT NOW YOU'VE GOT 
BIGGER PROBLEMS, MY FRIEND.

461
00:16:50,634 --> 00:16:51,843
SO WHY DON'T WE MAKE A DEAL?

462
00:16:51,843 --> 00:16:53,720
- WHAT, I GIVE YOU EVIDENCE 
AGAINST MY FATHER,

463
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:55,347
AND YOU PRETEND 
THAT I DIDN'T KILL KITTY?

464
00:16:55,347 --> 00:16:57,724
I MEAN, 
I-I DIDN'T KILL KITTY.

465
00:16:57,724 --> 00:16:59,643

466
00:16:59,643 --> 00:17:02,729
HELLO? 
OH, HEY, GEORGE MICHAEL.

UH, I'M SORRY.

00:17:05,649 --> 00:17:08,027
I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.

469
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:10,820
UM, MY SON HAS AN EMERGENCY.

470
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:12,406
- YOU KNOW, 
THERE'S A GROVER BOOK:

471
00:17:12,406 --> 00:17:14,324
"I CAN'T HOLD IT IN."

472
00:17:14,324 --> 00:17:17,702

00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:26,961
AND THEN RECEIVED 
A SERENDIPITOUS GIFT.

476
00:17:26,961 --> 00:17:29,173
- KICK IT BACK!

477
00:17:29,173 --> 00:17:33,968

480
00:17:42,852 --> 00:17:45,814

GET OFF THE FIELD!

481
00:17:45,814 --> 00:17:47,899
ARE YOU CRAZY?

HE MAY HAVE JUST SCARED AWAY

486
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:08,962
A MAN WHO SUPPORTED HIM

487
00:18:08,962 --> 00:18:12,966
IN THE WAY HE'D ALWAYS HOPED 
HIS OWN FATHER WOULD.

488
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:21,808
AND MICHAEL HEADED 
OVER TO THE MALL.

489
00:18:21,808 --> 00:18:23,102

490
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:25,562
- HEY, DAD, I DIDN'T KNOW 
WE WERE SHOPLIFTING, OKAY?

491
00:18:25,562 --> 00:18:26,730

492
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:28,190
WHAT'S THE MATTER 
WITH YOU, GOB?

493
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:30,359
- WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH ME? 
SHE'S THE SHOPLIFTER!

494
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:32,111
- I WASN'T SHOPLIFTING, 
YOU TWIT.

495
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:33,445
- YES, THANKS TO ME.

496
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:34,946
- NO. 
I WORK HERE.

497
00:18:34,946 --> 00:18:35,947
[all gasp]

498
00:18:35,947 --> 00:18:37,199
AT LEAST I USED TO.

499
00:18:37,199 --> 00:18:38,200
THEY FIRED ME 
BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT

500
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,784
I WAS HELPING 
THIS IDIOT SHOPLIFT.

501
00:18:39,784 --> 00:18:42,787
ALSO, THEY SAID I WASN'T 
A VERY GOOD SALESGIRL.

502
00:18:42,787 --> 00:18:47,126
- [chuckles] 
YOU CAN'T BE SERIOUS?

503
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:48,960
- A SALESGIRL. 
I KNEW IT!

504
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,420
I KNEW YOU COULDN'T PULL IT OFF.

505
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:53,382
THERE'S ONLY ONE MAGICIAN 
IN THIS FAMILY, AND THAT IS ME.

506
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:55,175
- AND YOU GOT CAUGHT 
BY A 13-YEAR-OLD GIRL.

507
00:18:55,175 --> 00:18:56,760
- [chuckles]

508
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:58,345
- YOU KNOW, THIS IS WHY 
I'M CONSTANTLY ASKING YOU

509
00:18:58,345 --> 00:18:59,388
TO STAY AWAY FROM MY SON.

510
00:18:59,388 --> 00:19:00,389
- YEAH, WELL, IT'S NOT LIKE 
YOU WERE THERE

511
00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:01,473
TO SPEND ANY TIME 
WITH ME, DAD.

512
00:19:01,473 --> 00:19:03,850
BECAUSE I'M NOT DAUGHTER 
ENOUGH FOR YOU.

513
00:19:03,850 --> 00:19:08,438
- GEORGE MICHAEL, UM, 
I'M ALWAYS THERE FOR YOU, OKAY?

514
00:19:08,438 --> 00:19:10,064
IT'S JUST YOU'RE GETTING 
A LITTLE TOO MANLY

515
00:19:10,064 --> 00:19:11,525
FOR BRING 
YOUR DAUGHTER TO WORK DAY.

516
00:19:11,525 --> 00:19:13,235
- DAD, 
THAT'S WHAT MAKES IT FUNNY.

517
00:19:13,235 --> 00:19:16,405
- I ALSO WANTED TO GIVE MAEBY 
A GOOD ROLE MODEL FOR A CHANGE.

518
00:19:16,405 --> 00:19:18,448
- YEAH, WELL, I GUESS, 
YOU LOOKING OUT FOR HER

519
00:19:18,448 --> 00:19:20,825
IS PROBABLY 
SOMETHING SHE COULD USE.

520
00:19:20,825 --> 00:19:22,452
- WHERE IS MAEBY?

521
00:19:22,452 --> 00:19:23,537
narrator: MICHAEL REALIZED

522
00:19:23,537 --> 00:19:24,996
HE HAD TO GET 
TO THE POLICE STATION

523
00:19:24,996 --> 00:19:26,540
BEFORE THEY GOT AHOLD OF MAEBY,

524
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:29,209
TO WHOM HE'D PROMISED $50 
TO TELL THE TRUTH.

525
00:19:29,209 --> 00:19:31,670
- UH, I'VE PUT A BOUNTY 
ON MY OWN HEAD.

526
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:36,258
narrator: BUT MAEBY'S INSTINCTS 
TO LIE RETURNED.

527
00:19:36,258 --> 00:19:37,801
- HEY, YOU CAN'T GO IN THERE.

528
00:19:37,801 --> 00:19:40,554
- NO, IT'S OKAY. 
I'M DETECTIVE FELLOWS' DAUGHTER.

529
00:19:40,554 --> 00:19:43,182
- OH, OH, SORRY. 
IT'S FOUR-THREE-FIVE.

530
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:44,891
AND THAT OPENS 
ANY DOOR IN THE BUILDING.

531
00:19:44,891 --> 00:19:47,894
- GREAT. 
THANKS.

532
00:19:52,524 --> 00:19:54,484
narrator: AND IT WAS THERE 
THAT MAEBY DISCOVERED

533
00:19:54,484 --> 00:19:56,486
THE KEY 
TO MICHAEL'S FREEDOM.

534
00:19:56,486 --> 00:19:58,154
- WELL, I APPRECIATE 
YOUR HONESTY.

535
00:19:58,154 --> 00:20:00,282
- MAEBY. 
WHAT--WHAT--WHAT'D SHE SAY?

536
00:20:00,282 --> 00:20:02,284
- I SAID THERE'S A TAPE 
OF KITTY GETTING ON THE BOAT,

537
00:20:02,284 --> 00:20:03,577
AND THAT YOU GUYS BLEW IT UP.

538
00:20:03,577 --> 00:20:06,496
I TOLD THEM THE TRUTH, 
LIKE YOU TOLD ME.

539
00:20:06,496 --> 00:20:08,582
- THAT-A-GIRL.

540
00:20:08,582 --> 00:20:10,334
THAT'S RIGHT. 
THAT'S, UH, THAT'S THE TRUTH.

541
00:20:10,334 --> 00:20:13,587
THAT'S EVERYTHING THAT WE KNOW.

542
00:20:13,587 --> 00:20:18,508
- YOU'RE FREE TO GO.

543
00:20:18,508 --> 00:20:20,927
- GREAT. 
HERE WE GO.

544
00:20:24,264 --> 00:20:25,557
WHAT THE HELL 
JUST HAPPENED IN THERE.?

545
00:20:25,557 --> 00:20:27,309
- RELAX. 
THEY GOT NOTHING ON YOU.

546
00:20:27,309 --> 00:20:28,602
THEY'RE BLUFFING. 
KITTY'S ALIVE.

547
00:20:28,602 --> 00:20:30,229
I JUST SAW HER IN THE BACK ROOM.

548
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:31,438
THEY JUST WANTED 
TO GET YOU SCARED

549
00:20:31,438 --> 00:20:34,358
SO YOU'D TESTIFY 
AGAINST POP-POP.

550
00:20:34,358 --> 00:20:36,443
- UNBELIEVABLE. 
OH, THAT'S GREAT.

551
00:20:36,443 --> 00:20:38,737
YOU JUST TOLD THEM THE TRUTH; 
THEY LET US WALK.

552
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:41,155
I GUESS I OWE YOU 
50 BUCKS, HUH?

553
00:20:41,155 --> 00:20:42,616
- YEAH, 
I'D SAVE YOUR MONEY.

554
00:20:42,616 --> 00:20:43,783
KITTY'S GOT A LOT OF EVIDENCE,

555
00:20:43,783 --> 00:20:45,702
AND SHE THINKS THAT YOU 
TRIED TO KILL HER.

556
00:20:45,702 --> 00:20:50,707
SO YOU'RE PROBABLY GOING TO 
NEED A BETTER ATTORNEY.

557
00:20:50,707 --> 00:20:52,417
[horn honks]

558
00:20:52,417 --> 00:20:54,461
- LO SIENTO.

559
00:20:54,461 --> 00:20:57,547
- I HATE BRING 
YOUR DAUGHTER TO WORK DAY.

560
00:20:57,547 --> 00:21:00,259
narrator: ON THE NEXT 
"ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT."

561
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:02,135
TOBIAS LOSES HIS SECURITY JOB

562
00:21:02,135 --> 00:21:04,220
TRYING TO SOLVE THE STORE'S 
MICE PROBLEM.

563
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:05,555
[gunshots]

564
00:21:05,555 --> 00:21:10,560
LINDSAY, NOW WITHOUT A JOB, 
GOES WITH HER INITIAL INSTINCT.

565
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:12,061
- MOM, WE'RE GONNA 
BE LATE FOR PRACTICE!

566
00:21:12,061 --> 00:21:14,523
narrator: 
AND ANNYONG EXACTS HIS REVENGE.

567
00:21:14,523 --> 00:21:16,608
- WHERE IS EVERYBODY? 
- HEADS UP, FATTY!

568
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:17,776
[screams]
