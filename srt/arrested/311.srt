1
00:00:02,162 --> 00:00:05,005
narrator: 
IT'S "ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT."

2
00:00:05,005 --> 00:00:08,648
MICHAEL BLUTH BELIEVED HE'D JUST 
MADE A SHOCKING DISCOVERY.

3
00:00:08,648 --> 00:00:11,171
- I MEAN, THAT MIGHT BE AN OLDER 
SISTER THAT WE'VE NEVER MET.

4
00:00:11,171 --> 00:00:14,054
- WOW. LOOK AT THE BEAK 
ON THAT BIRD.

5
00:00:14,054 --> 00:00:16,856
narrator: MICHAEL FOUND THE 
PICTURE IN A SECRET ROOM

6
00:00:16,856 --> 00:00:19,499
WHILE LOOKING FOR INCRIMINATING 
EVIDENCE AGAINST HIS FATHER.

7
00:00:19,499 --> 00:00:21,421
- I HAVE AN OLDER SISTER?

8
00:00:21,421 --> 00:00:23,543
DON'T YOU KIND OF REMEMBER 
HAVING AN OLDER SISTER?

9
00:00:23,543 --> 00:00:24,584
- NOT AT ALL. 
WHAT, DO YOU?

10
00:00:24,584 --> 00:00:25,625
- A LITTLE BIT.

11
00:00:25,625 --> 00:00:27,507
YOU KNOW, I MEAN, 
"NELLIE" DOES SOUND FAMILIAR.

12
00:00:27,507 --> 00:00:29,789
MOM AND DAD CLEARLY WERE TRYING 
TO KEEP THIS HIDDEN FROM US.

13
00:00:29,789 --> 00:00:30,910
- BUT THIS COULD BE ANYBODY.

14
00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:32,512
THIS COULD BE 
A DEFORMED NEIGHBOR OR--

15
00:00:32,512 --> 00:00:35,835
- A CHILD THAT MOM AND DAD 
GAVE UP FOR SOME REASON

16
00:00:35,835 --> 00:00:36,956
AND WHOSE IDENTITY

17
00:00:36,956 --> 00:00:38,638
THEY'RE NOW USING 
TO PIN THEIR CRIMES ON.

18
00:00:38,638 --> 00:00:39,879
THE PROSECUTOR SAID THAT THERE

19
00:00:39,879 --> 00:00:41,961
WAS THAT ACCOUNT WITH MONEY 
IN IT LABELED "N. BLUTH."

20
00:00:41,961 --> 00:00:43,963
HER NAME IS NELLIE.

21
00:00:43,963 --> 00:00:45,845
- MICHAEL, DO YOU REMEMBER WHEN 
YOU THOUGHT

22
00:00:45,845 --> 00:00:47,847
THERE WAS A MYSTERIOUS 
MR. "F" OUT TO GET YOU?

23
00:00:47,847 --> 00:00:48,928
- [singing] MR. "F"

24
00:00:48,928 --> 00:00:51,371
- YEAH, BUT THAT WAS RETARD-- 
MISGUIDED.

25
00:00:51,371 --> 00:00:53,653
THIS IS DIFFERENT. 
THIS IS N. BLUTH.

26
00:00:53,653 --> 00:00:55,375
- [singing] DIFFERENT

27
00:00:55,375 --> 00:00:56,896
- WELL, WHY DON'T YOU JUST 
GO TO DAD

28
00:00:56,896 --> 00:00:58,538
AND ASK WHO NELLIE IS, 
POINT BLANK?

29
00:00:58,538 --> 00:01:00,540
- SO HE CAN JUST 
COVER IT UP AND LIE?

30
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:03,103
I CAN'T STAND TO HEAR 
ONE MORE LIE OUT OF THIS FAMILY.

31
00:01:03,103 --> 00:01:06,066
- AH, THERE'S THE WOMAN 
I'M SEXUALLY ATTRACTED TO.

32
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:08,108
- OKAY. BUT THAT'S 
THE LAST ONE.

33
00:01:08,108 --> 00:01:10,430
- WELL, I'M OFF TO THE GYM 
TO PREPARE FOR OUR TRYST.

34
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:11,871
- TRYST?

35
00:01:11,871 --> 00:01:12,992
- YES, LINDSAY AND I

36
00:01:12,992 --> 00:01:15,315
ARE PLANNING A NIGHT 
OF HETEROSEXUAL INTERCOURSE.

37
00:01:15,315 --> 00:01:16,756
- YOU CAN JUST SAY INTERCOURSE.

38
00:01:16,756 --> 00:01:18,358
- WE TALKED ABOUT IT LAST NIGHT.

39
00:01:18,358 --> 00:01:21,161
narrator: AFTER A DISAPPOINTING 
ATTEMPT AT LOVEMAKING.

40
00:01:21,161 --> 00:01:22,642
- AH, THIS ISN'T GOING 
TO HAPPEN.

41
00:01:22,642 --> 00:01:24,284
I JUST WANT YOU TO BE SATISFIED.

42
00:01:24,284 --> 00:01:26,486
- OH, T., YOU'RE ALWAYS 
THINKING OF OTHERS.

43
00:01:26,486 --> 00:01:28,448
- I TRIED THAT. 
IT DIDN'T WORK EITHER.

44
00:01:28,448 --> 00:01:31,371
- WELL, YOU KNOW, MAYBE I WOULD 
BE MORE ATTRACTED TO YOU

45
00:01:31,371 --> 00:01:33,213
IF YOU WERE IN BETTER SHAPE.

46
00:01:33,213 --> 00:01:35,935
YOU KNOW, IF YOU WERE JUST 
MORE MUSCULAR, MASCULINE.

47
00:01:35,935 --> 00:01:37,016
DOES THAT MAKE ME SHALLOW?

48
00:01:37,016 --> 00:01:38,538
- NO.

49
00:01:38,538 --> 00:01:40,900
I WAS GONNA SAY 
THE SAME THING TO YOU.

50
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:43,383
MAYBE WE SHOULD TAKE A LITTLE 
TIME TO WORK ON OURSELVES,

51
00:01:43,383 --> 00:01:46,906
AND THEN WE'LL PLAN A SPECIAL 
NIGHT IN SEVEN OR EIGHT DAYS.

52
00:01:46,906 --> 00:01:47,947
- OR A COUPLE OF WEEKS.

53
00:01:47,947 --> 00:01:49,309
- LET'S SAY THREE WEEKS.

54
00:01:49,309 --> 00:01:50,590
- WE'RE GONNA 
GO FOR IT IN A MONTH.

55
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:52,112
- STARTING 
AT THE START OF NEXT MONTH.

56
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:53,713
- AND WE'RE GONNA CALL IT 
A 31-DAY MONTH.

57
00:01:53,713 --> 00:01:56,116
- EVEN THOUGH THIS PARTICULAR 
MONTH HAS 30 DAYS.

58
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:58,918
- OH, YOU KNOW, I'VE ALREADY 
PREPARED A LIST OF "WON'TS."

59
00:01:58,918 --> 00:02:01,961
- OH, YOU'RE NOT GONNA BELIEVE 
THIS. MY LIST OF "CAN'TS."

60
00:02:01,961 --> 00:02:04,604
- MARITAL LOVE 
CAN BE SO ROMANTIC.

61
00:02:04,604 --> 00:02:06,766
- WHAT'S THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN? 
- WHAT?

62
00:02:06,766 --> 00:02:07,887
- "MARITAL LOVE."

63
00:02:07,887 --> 00:02:09,969
YOU WERE LOOKING RIGHT AT ME, 
AND YOU SAID "MARITAL LOVE."

64
00:02:09,969 --> 00:02:10,810
WHY WOULD I--

65
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:12,572
narrator: GEORGE MICHAEL 
WAS INTERESTED

66
00:02:12,572 --> 00:02:13,853
BECAUSE EARLIER THAT DAY,

67
00:02:13,853 --> 00:02:16,376
HE'D DISCOVERED THAT THE RECENT 
MOCK WEDDING HE'D ACTED IN

68
00:02:16,376 --> 00:02:18,338
WITH HIS COUSIN MAEBY-- 
- WE'RE MARRIED?

69
00:02:18,338 --> 00:02:21,861
narrator: WAS, IN FACT, AS REAL 
AND BINDING AS THE RICE PUDDING

70
00:02:21,861 --> 00:02:24,664
THE DISORIENTED PATIENTS 
HAD THROWN AT THEM.

71
00:02:24,664 --> 00:02:26,065
- I WAS TALKING 
TO YOUR AUNT AND UNCLE.

72
00:02:26,065 --> 00:02:27,547
- OF COURSE.

73
00:02:27,547 --> 00:02:30,430
THEY'RE MARRIED TOO-- 
EACH OTHER.

74
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:31,711
- OH, PLEASE. PITY THE FOOL

75
00:02:31,711 --> 00:02:34,154
WHO GIVES ME A BUNCH OF 
JIBBER-JABBER ABOUT ROMANCE.

76
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:35,915
MY RELIGIOUS GIRLFRIEND 
JUST DUMPED ME

77
00:02:35,915 --> 00:02:37,557
AND FOR A SIMPLE 
LITTLE MISUNDERSTANDING.

78
00:02:37,557 --> 00:02:38,998
I MEAN, 
IF SOMEONE WAS ALWAYS ASKING YOU

79
00:02:38,998 --> 00:02:41,481
TO EMBRACE THE HOLY TRINITY, 
WHAT WOULD YOU THINK THEY MEANT?

80
00:02:41,481 --> 00:02:43,723
narrator: GOB THOUGHT IT MEANT 
A THREE-WAY.

81
00:02:43,723 --> 00:02:48,047
- WHAT? I THOUGHT THAT'S WHAT 
ALL YOU GUYS LIVED FOR.

82
00:02:48,047 --> 00:02:49,249
WHAT ABOUT YOU? 
YOU GAME?

83
00:02:49,249 --> 00:02:51,010
- WELL, MAYBE 
SHE JUST WASN'T FOR YOU.

84
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:51,971
- WHICH ONE?

85
00:02:51,971 --> 00:02:53,773
- I REALLY WASN'T 
PAYING ATTENTION.

86
00:02:53,773 --> 00:02:54,934
- THE REAL PROBLEM IS

87
00:02:54,934 --> 00:02:57,417
SHE KEEPS SAYING THAT GOD 
IS GONNA SHOW ME A SIGN.

88
00:02:57,417 --> 00:03:02,542
THE SOMETHING OF MY WAYS. 
"WISDOM"?

89
00:03:02,542 --> 00:03:03,983
- IT'S PROBABLY "WISDOM."

90
00:03:03,983 --> 00:03:05,465
GOB, LISTEN, CAN I ASK YOU 
A QUESTION?

91
00:03:05,465 --> 00:03:07,186
DO YOU REMEMBER GROWING UP 
WITH A SISTER?

92
00:03:07,186 --> 00:03:09,068
- SISTER.

93
00:03:09,068 --> 00:03:11,991
UH, NO, I DON'T.

94
00:03:11,991 --> 00:03:14,474
NOT REALLY RINGIN' 
ANY BELLS.

95
00:03:14,474 --> 00:03:15,755
- OTHER THAN LINDSAY, 
OF COURSE.

96
00:03:15,755 --> 00:03:17,357
- OH, LINDSAY!

97
00:03:17,357 --> 00:03:19,799
- WELL, YOU MIGHT NOT BE THE 
MOST REPUTABLE SOURCE ON THIS.

98
00:03:19,799 --> 00:03:21,481
- narrator: UPSTAIRS 
GEORGE MICHAEL

99
00:03:21,481 --> 00:03:23,603
WAS SHARING HIS NEWS 
WITH HIS COUSIN.

100
00:03:23,603 --> 00:03:24,924
- YOU MEAN WE'RE MARRIED?

101
00:03:24,924 --> 00:03:27,287
- NO, IT'S JUST A PIECE OF 
PAPER. IT DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING.

102
00:03:27,287 --> 00:03:29,208
- WE SHOULD SHRED IT. 
IT'S CREEPING ME OUT.

103
00:03:29,208 --> 00:03:30,890
- YEAH, ME--IT'S--

104
00:03:30,890 --> 00:03:32,572
BUT IF WE JUST PUT IT 
OVER THE DRESSER,

105
00:03:32,572 --> 00:03:34,614
LIKE WE THINK IT'S A JOKE, 
THEN WE WOULD ALWAYS KNOW--

106
00:03:34,614 --> 00:03:36,656
- IT IS A JOKE.

107
00:03:36,656 --> 00:03:39,018
- UNLESS WE GET IT FRAMED.

108
00:03:39,018 --> 00:03:42,622
narrator: AND MICHAEL WENT TO 
INVESTIGATE HIS MYSTERY SISTER.

109
00:03:42,622 --> 00:03:43,943
- MICHAEL! WHAT A SURPRISE.

110
00:03:43,943 --> 00:03:46,506
- REALLY? WERE YOU 
EXPECTING SOMEBODY ELSE?

111
00:03:46,506 --> 00:03:48,868
MAYBE, UH, ONE OF 
YOUR TWO DAUGHTERS?

112
00:03:48,868 --> 00:03:52,272
- OH, LINDSAY AND TOBIAS 
NEVER VISIT.

113
00:03:52,272 --> 00:03:54,434
[giggling] 
WE'RE SO BAD!

114
00:03:54,434 --> 00:03:57,036
- I-I ACTUALLY MEANT 
LINDSAY AND NELLIE.

115
00:03:57,036 --> 00:04:00,240
- YOU CALL HIM THAT TOO?

116
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,161
OH, IT'S SO NICE TO BE ABLE 
TO TALK LIKE THIS.

117
00:04:02,161 --> 00:04:03,963
- WHERE'S DAD?

118
00:04:03,963 --> 00:04:04,964
WHAT'S ALL THIS?

119
00:04:04,964 --> 00:04:06,406
- COMPUTER STUFF 
FROM THE OFFICE.

120
00:04:06,406 --> 00:04:07,647
- OH, NO, NO, POP, 
YOU'RE NOT DOIN'

121
00:04:07,647 --> 00:04:09,369
ANOTHER ONE OF THOSE BLACK 
FRIDAYS, ARE YOU?

122
00:04:09,369 --> 00:04:10,570
YOUR MASS FIRINGS?

123
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:13,253
narrator: BEFORE FIRING 
HIS EMPLOYEES, HOWEVER,

124
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:14,414
GEORGE SR. HAD BEEN SURE

125
00:04:14,414 --> 00:04:16,576
TO CLEAR THE OFFICE 
OF ITS VALUABLES.

126
00:04:16,576 --> 00:04:18,818
- SO WHEN DO WE GET TO SEE 
OUR NEW, FANCY OFFICES?

127
00:04:18,818 --> 00:04:20,340
- SOON AS YOU GET 
YOUR NEW, FANCY JOBS.

128
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:22,221
YOU'RE ALL FIRED.

129
00:04:22,221 --> 00:04:24,424
narrator: THE EMPLOYEES 
NEVER SAW IT COMING,

130
00:04:24,424 --> 00:04:26,866
EVEN THOUGH THEIR FIRST TASK 
WAS OFTEN TO UNLOAD COMPUTERS

131
00:04:26,866 --> 00:04:29,909
FROM A RENTAL TRUCK.

132
00:04:29,909 --> 00:04:32,992
- NO, IT'S NOT A BLACK FRIDAY, 
ALTHOUGH I DID ENJOY THOSE.

133
00:04:32,992 --> 00:04:34,153
NO, THE PROSECUTION'S

134
00:04:34,153 --> 00:04:36,476
GONNA WANT TO HAVE ACCESS 
TO THE HARD DRIVE,

135
00:04:36,476 --> 00:04:37,677
SO I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE

136
00:04:37,677 --> 00:04:40,239
EVERYTHING'S NICE AND CLEAN 
FOR THEM.

137
00:04:40,239 --> 00:04:41,561
- WHAT THE HELL 
IS THAT THING?

138
00:04:41,561 --> 00:04:42,322
- AN ELECTROMAGNET.

139
00:04:42,322 --> 00:04:44,324
THINK OF IT 
AS A GIANT DELETE KEY.

140
00:04:44,324 --> 00:04:46,406
- WELL, I HATE TO SPOIL 
YOUR FUN, DAD,

141
00:04:46,406 --> 00:04:50,129
BUT I GOT BACKUPS ON ALL OF THAT 
STUFF, AND THIS IS ILLEGAL.

142
00:04:50,129 --> 00:04:52,492
- OH! WELL, EXCUSE ME, 
JUDGE REINHOLD,

143
00:04:52,492 --> 00:04:55,214
BUT I AM TRYING 
TO PROTECT MY FAMILY.

144
00:04:57,577 --> 00:04:59,459
- THAT'S NOT A REAL 
GOLD NECKLACE, IS IT?

145
00:04:59,459 --> 00:05:02,462
- WELL, IT WASN'T REALLY 
YOUR 50th BIRTHDAY.

146
00:05:02,462 --> 00:05:05,064
- YOU KNOW, DAD, YOU CAN'T HAVE 
THIS STUFF IN HERE, ALL RIGHT?

147
00:05:05,064 --> 00:05:07,106
AND WE DON'T NEED 
MORE TROUBLE.

148
00:05:07,106 --> 00:05:08,988
IT'S BAD ENOUGH YOU GOT 
BUSTER FAKING A COMA

149
00:05:08,988 --> 00:05:10,830
JUST SO 
HE DOESN'T HAVE TO TESTIFY.

150
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:13,152
- I'VE BEEN TRYING TO GET HIM 
OUT OF THAT COMA.

151
00:05:13,152 --> 00:05:14,354
IT'S COSTING US A FORTUNE.

152
00:05:14,354 --> 00:05:15,955
HE'S SLEEPING US DRY.

153
00:05:15,955 --> 00:05:20,079
- OKAY, FAKER, 
I'M CUTTING THE CORD.

154
00:05:20,079 --> 00:05:21,521
I'LL SEE YA 
AT THE SNACK MACHINE.

155
00:05:24,364 --> 00:05:26,566
- WELL, IF HE KNOWS THAT YOU 
DON'T WANT HIM IN THE COMA,

156
00:05:26,566 --> 00:05:27,727
THEN WHY'S HE STILL IN IT?

157
00:05:27,727 --> 00:05:29,569
- FOR SOME REASON, 
HE WON'T TELL ME.

158
00:05:29,569 --> 00:05:31,371
narrator: 
HE'D FALLEN FOR HIS DAY NURSE.

159
00:05:31,371 --> 00:05:33,012
- BUSTER, YOU'RE SO DEAR.

160
00:05:33,012 --> 00:05:35,375
narrator: SHE'D FOUND HIS 
COMPLETE LACK OF PERSONALITY

161
00:05:35,375 --> 00:05:36,976
AND MOVEMENT ENCHANTING.

162
00:05:36,976 --> 00:05:38,778
- I WISH YOU COULD 
SAY SOMETHING.

163
00:05:38,778 --> 00:05:41,340
COURSE, IF YOU DID, 
EVERYTHING WOULD BE RUINED

164
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:43,703
'CAUSE YOU WOULDN'T BE AS PURE.

165
00:05:43,703 --> 00:05:46,386
- SPEAKING OF LIVING A LIE, 
I DON'T SUPPOSE

166
00:05:46,386 --> 00:05:49,148
EITHER OF YOU HAVE REMEMBERED 
WHO THIS N. BLUTH IS.

167
00:05:49,148 --> 00:05:51,471
NOT A NICK OR A NELLIE?

168
00:05:51,471 --> 00:05:53,112
- JUST THE ONE 
WHO MARRIED LINDSAY.

169
00:05:53,112 --> 00:05:55,395
- [guffaws]

170
00:05:55,395 --> 00:05:57,797
OH, ISN'T IT FUN 
TO TALK LIKE THIS?

171
00:05:57,797 --> 00:06:00,279
[giggling]

172
00:06:00,279 --> 00:06:02,281
narrator: SO MICHAEL RETURNED 
TO THE OFFICE,

173
00:06:02,281 --> 00:06:03,723
WHERE THE ATMOSPHERE 
WAS PARANOID.

174
00:06:03,723 --> 00:06:04,804
- IS IT BLACK FRIDAY?

175
00:06:04,804 --> 00:06:06,365
- NO ONE'S GETTING FIRED. 
NO ONE'S GETTING FIRED.

176
00:06:06,365 --> 00:06:08,408
- BUT WE HAVEN'T BEEN PAID, 
AND THEY TOOK OUR COMPUTERS.

177
00:06:08,408 --> 00:06:10,570
- I KNOW WHO THIS LOOKS BAD, 
BUT IT'S JUST MY FATHER

178
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:12,652
TRYING TO ERASE ALL THE HARD 
DRIVES TO AVOID CONVICTION.

179
00:06:12,652 --> 00:06:13,733
THE COMPANY IS FINE.

180
00:06:13,733 --> 00:06:15,214
THIS IS--THIS IS FUN 
THOUGH, ISN'T IT?

181
00:06:15,214 --> 00:06:17,296
THEY BROUGHT OUT 
ALL THE OLD MACHINES.

182
00:06:17,296 --> 00:06:18,898
I MEAN, 
THEY'VE SEEN BETTER DAYS,

183
00:06:18,898 --> 00:06:20,900
BUT I'M SURE THEY'RE ALL 
FUNCTIONAL, RIGHT?

184
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:21,581
LIKE TOM HERE.

185
00:06:21,581 --> 00:06:23,583
- I'M 30.

186
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:24,624
- YOU'RE KIDDING ME.

187
00:06:25,785 --> 00:06:29,188
narrator: BUT MICHAEL FOUND THE 
EQUIPMENT FRUSTRATING AS WELL.

188
00:06:29,188 --> 00:06:31,270
- "GOB'S PROGRAM"?

189
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:33,433
IDIOT.

190
00:06:33,433 --> 00:06:38,438
narrator: AND THEN HE NOTICED 
SOMETHING ELSE.

191
00:06:38,438 --> 00:06:39,318
- NELLIE.

192
00:06:39,318 --> 00:06:40,960
- MICHAEL, I GOTTA TALK TO--

193
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,803
- OH, WOW. 
K-Y PRO, HUH?

194
00:06:43,803 --> 00:06:45,965
HEY, DON'T GET ANY MOISTURE 
ON THESE BABES.

195
00:06:45,965 --> 00:06:48,007
[crackling] 
- HEY! TOBIAS.

196
00:06:48,007 --> 00:06:50,089
BUDDY, I NEEDED 
THAT INFORMATION.

197
00:06:50,089 --> 00:06:52,251
THIS IS THAT SISTER 
I'VE BEEN LOOKIN' FOR.

198
00:06:52,251 --> 00:06:53,693
WELL, JUST HIT "PRINT SCREEN."

199
00:06:53,693 --> 00:06:55,695
I'M SURE THAT WHATEVER'S 
ON THERE WILL COME UP.

200
00:06:55,695 --> 00:06:57,737
- OH, LOOK AT THAT.

201
00:06:59,699 --> 00:07:02,141
I KIND OF REMEMBER THESE 
BEING FASTER, YOU KNOW?

202
00:07:02,141 --> 00:07:03,943
- WELL, WE WERE PROBABLY 
ALL SO JACKED UP

203
00:07:03,943 --> 00:07:06,305
ON AMYL AND DISCO MUSIC 
WE DIDN'T NOTICE.

204
00:07:06,305 --> 00:07:08,267
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT, I'M GLAD 
ABOUT THIS PRINTER LAG

205
00:07:08,267 --> 00:07:11,471
BECAUSE I WAS HOPING TO HAVE A 
JAW SESSION WITH YOU.

206
00:07:11,471 --> 00:07:14,073
- WELL, WHY DON'T WE JUST SAY 
AS LONG AS THAT MEANS A TALK?

207
00:07:14,073 --> 00:07:18,157
- I FIND MYSELF ATTRACTED TO 
SOMEONE WHO'S NOT MY WIFE.

208
00:07:18,157 --> 00:07:20,760
- WHAT'S HER NAME? 
- MICHAEL.

209
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:23,643
CAN YOU BELIEVE IT?

210
00:07:23,643 --> 00:07:24,844
- YOU'RE MARRIED TO MY SISTER.

211
00:07:24,844 --> 00:07:26,285
- DON'T YOU THINK I KNOW THAT?

212
00:07:26,285 --> 00:07:28,888
- I-I'M NOT INTERESTED 
IN YOU THAT WAY.

213
00:07:28,888 --> 00:07:30,329
- WHAT WAY?

214
00:07:30,329 --> 00:07:32,371
- PICK ONE. 
- NO.

215
00:07:32,371 --> 00:07:35,455
DID YOU THINK YOU WERE THE 
MICHAEL I WAS TALKING ABOUT? NO.

216
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:36,456
- WHAT?

217
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:38,778
- NO, INTERESTING THAT 
YOUR MIND WENT THERE THOUGH.

218
00:07:38,778 --> 00:07:39,819
OKAY. UH, NO.

219
00:07:39,819 --> 00:07:43,583
I'M AFRAID THE MICHAEL I'M 
TALKING ABOUT IS ALL LADY.

220
00:07:43,583 --> 00:07:44,864
SHE'S THE TRAINER AT MY GYM.

221
00:07:44,864 --> 00:07:46,666
- THIS THE TRAINER YOU 
STARTED WITH TODAY?

222
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:48,548
- INDEED. CAN YOU BELIEVE 
SHE'S A BODYBUILDER?

223
00:07:48,548 --> 00:07:50,229
- INDEED.

224
00:07:50,229 --> 00:07:52,031
- WHAT AM I DOING? 
WHAT AM I DOING?

225
00:07:52,031 --> 00:07:53,272
WHAT AM I DOING? 
WHAT AM I DOING?

226
00:07:53,272 --> 00:07:55,635
- YOU'RE NERVOUS ABOUT BECOMING 
INTIMATE WITH LINDSAY AGAIN.

227
00:07:55,635 --> 00:07:56,596
- I GUESS.

228
00:07:56,596 --> 00:07:58,197
- YOU PROBABLY SHOULD NOT 
RUSH INTO THINGS.

229
00:07:58,197 --> 00:08:00,880
DON'T CALL THIS GIRL-MICHAEL. 
STAY AWAY FROM THE GYM.

230
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:01,921
JUST LEAVE IT ALONE.

231
00:08:01,921 --> 00:08:03,282
- WISE WORDS, BOY-MICHAEL.

232
00:08:03,282 --> 00:08:04,363
I'LL TELL YOU,

233
00:08:04,363 --> 00:08:07,326
IF I WASN'T SO DRIPPING AND 
DISGUSTINGLY SWEATY RIGHT NOW,

234
00:08:07,326 --> 00:08:09,408
I'D HOP OVER THIS DESK 
AND GIVE YOU SUCH A HUG.

235
00:08:09,408 --> 00:08:11,531
HEY, COULDA, 
SHOULDA, WOULDA.

236
00:08:11,531 --> 00:08:13,252
- HEY, HEY. NO, NO.

237
00:08:13,252 --> 00:08:15,575
OOH, LOOK. 
NUMBER'S UP. LOOK AT THAT.

238
00:08:15,575 --> 00:08:17,897
AH, THAT WOULD'VE 
BEEN A SEVEN.

239
00:08:17,897 --> 00:08:19,258
narrator: LATER THAT NIGHT,

240
00:08:19,258 --> 00:08:21,060
LUCILLE VISITED BUSTER 
IN THE HOSPITAL.

241
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:22,261
- WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?

242
00:08:22,261 --> 00:08:25,104
- MY NAME IS REPRESENTATIVE 
JOHN VAN HEUSEN.

243
00:08:25,104 --> 00:08:28,588
AND I AM HERE TO PROTECT THE 
DIGNITY OF THIS BOY'S LIFE.

244
00:08:28,588 --> 00:08:30,710
- DIGNITY? 
EASY FOR YOU TO SAY.

245
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:32,912
I'M THE ONE WHO HAS TO 
LOOFAH HIS STUMP.

246
00:08:32,912 --> 00:08:34,834
- I BELIEVE DEATH IS WRONG 
IN ALL OF ITS FORMS,

247
00:08:34,834 --> 00:08:36,315
EXCEPT LETHAL INJECTION.

248
00:08:36,315 --> 00:08:38,998
BUT THAT'S JUST AS A DETERRENT 
AGAINST MORE DEATH.

249
00:08:38,998 --> 00:08:42,361
AND THIS YOUNG MAN 
IS ENJOYING LIFE.

250
00:08:42,361 --> 00:08:44,764
HEY! HEY! HUH? 
HEY, LOOK AT US, HUH?

251
00:08:44,764 --> 00:08:46,886
WE'RE HAVIN' 
A BLAST HERE, HUH?

252
00:08:46,886 --> 00:08:49,529
- HOW THE HELL DID YOU EVEN FIND 
OUT ABOUT SLEEPING BEAUTY HERE?

253
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:50,730
- IT WAS AN ANONYMOUS TIP

254
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:52,612
FROM SOMEONE WHO CARES 
ABOUT BUSTER'S LIFE.

255
00:08:52,612 --> 00:08:54,774
- IT'S NOT RINGING 
ANY BELLS.

256
00:08:54,774 --> 00:08:56,656
narrator: 
IN FACT, IT WAS BUSTER HIMSELF.

257
00:08:56,656 --> 00:08:59,458
- THEY'RE TRYING 
TO KILL BABY BUSTER.

258
00:08:59,458 --> 00:09:01,661
OH, THAT'S RIGHT-- 
FROM THE VIDEOS.

259
00:09:01,661 --> 00:09:04,904
- WELL, NO ONE'S KILLIN' 
BABY BUSTER ON MY WATCH.

260
00:09:04,904 --> 00:09:06,185
THAT IS UNLESS, OF COURSE,

261
00:09:06,185 --> 00:09:08,387
IT'S AS A PENALTY 
IN A THREE-STRIKES SCENARIO.

262
00:09:08,387 --> 00:09:12,511
- NO ONE'S CALLED HIM BABY 
BUSTER SINCE HIGH SCHOOL.

263
00:09:12,511 --> 00:09:14,714
narrator: 
MICHAEL, MEANWHILE,

264
00:09:14,714 --> 00:09:18,317
HAD CALLED ONE NUMBER AFTER 
ANOTHER UNTIL HE FOUND FRANK,

265
00:09:18,317 --> 00:09:20,119
A COLLEAGUE OF THE WOMAN 
HE KNEW AS NELLIE.

266
00:09:20,119 --> 00:09:21,360
- I'M LOOKING FOR NELLIE.

267
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,362
- YEAH. WELL, SHE'S 
WORKIN' A SOFTWARE CONVENTION

268
00:09:23,362 --> 00:09:24,564
AT SOME HOTEL.

269
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:26,045
I CAN SET UP A MEETING 
AT THE BAR, MAN.

270
00:09:26,045 --> 00:09:27,727
- APPRECIATE IT.

271
00:09:27,727 --> 00:09:30,089
narrator: 
SO MICHAEL ARRIVED AT THE BAR,

272
00:09:30,089 --> 00:09:32,572
HOPING TO SPOT SOMEONE 
WHO COULD BE HIS SISTER.

273
00:09:35,935 --> 00:09:36,976
- SHE GREW INTO THE NOSE.

274
00:09:36,976 --> 00:09:39,338
NELLIE? HEY! HI.

275
00:09:39,338 --> 00:09:41,340
MICHAEL. 
FRANK SENT ME.

276
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:43,262
I THINK I MIGHT BE 
INTERESTED IN YOUR SERVICES.

277
00:09:43,262 --> 00:09:44,303
- YOU WON'T BE SORRY.

278
00:09:44,303 --> 00:09:46,265
- YEAH? I WAS HOPING THAT 
MAYBE WE COULD JUST TALK

279
00:09:46,265 --> 00:09:47,266
A LITTLE BIT FIRST, HUH?

280
00:09:47,266 --> 00:09:48,507
- YEAH, MOST PEOPLE WANT TO.

281
00:09:48,507 --> 00:09:50,109
narrator: AND THEY DID TALK.

282
00:09:50,109 --> 00:09:51,550
AND MICHAEL FELT A CONNECTION

283
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:54,353
LIKE HE'D NEVER FELT 
WITH ANYONE IN HIS FAMILY.

284
00:09:54,353 --> 00:09:56,876
- I HAD A LOCKER ON THE FIRST 
FLOOR FRESHMAN YEAR,

285
00:09:56,876 --> 00:09:58,998
RIGHT NEXT TO THE CAFE 
WITH ALL THE JUNIOR LOCKERS,

286
00:09:58,998 --> 00:10:00,359
SO IT WAS CLEARLY A MISTAKE.

287
00:10:00,359 --> 00:10:01,761
BUT I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING, 
RIGHT?

288
00:10:01,761 --> 00:10:03,763
- OOH, YOU'RE BAD.

289
00:10:03,763 --> 00:10:06,045
- I HAD THAT SAME LOCKER 
ALL THROUGHOUT SOPHOMORE YEAR.

290
00:10:06,045 --> 00:10:08,367
JUNIOR YEAR THEY HAD ME ON THE 
THIRD FLOOR WITH ALL THE FROSH.

291
00:10:08,367 --> 00:10:09,448
- THAT IS WILD.

292
00:10:09,448 --> 00:10:10,690
- I HAD THE SAME COMBO 
ALL THROUGHOUT

293
00:10:10,690 --> 00:10:11,891
'CAUSE I TRANSFERRED THE LOCK.

294
00:10:11,891 --> 00:10:13,132
LET ME TELL YOU WHY 
I TRANSFERRED.

295
00:10:13,132 --> 00:10:14,293
narrator: HEY, LET'S SEE WHAT

296
00:10:14,293 --> 00:10:15,615
SOME OF THE OTHER FOLKS 
ARE UP TO.

297
00:10:17,136 --> 00:10:18,097
NOTHING THERE.

298
00:10:20,459 --> 00:10:22,501
OR THERE.

299
00:10:22,501 --> 00:10:25,064
- [singing] OH, MY, OH, MY

300
00:10:25,064 --> 00:10:26,185
narrator: 
OH, MY.

301
00:10:26,185 --> 00:10:28,467
LET'S GET BACK TO MICHAEL.

302
00:10:28,467 --> 00:10:29,789
- IT WAS JOE NAMATH'S NUMBER,

303
00:10:29,789 --> 00:10:31,230
BABE RUTH'S NUMBER, 
THEN MY BIRTHDAY.

304
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:33,633
- THAT IS A GREAT STORY.

305
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:35,034
narrator: 
IT WASN'T A GREAT STORY.

306
00:10:35,034 --> 00:10:36,836
NELLIE WAS JUST 
A GREAT LISTENER.

307
00:10:36,836 --> 00:10:39,038
MOST PROSTITUTES ARE.

308
00:10:39,038 --> 00:10:40,559
- NELLIE, THE HELL 
WITH FORMALITIES.

309
00:10:40,559 --> 00:10:42,601
I THINK YOU AND I SHOULD 
DO BUSINESS TOGETHER.

310
00:10:42,601 --> 00:10:43,602
- ME TOO.

311
00:10:51,731 --> 00:10:53,572
narrator: MICHAEL HAD JUST 
HIRED A WOMAN

312
00:10:53,572 --> 00:10:56,495
HE'D SECRETLY 
BELIEVED TO BE HIS SISTER.

313
00:10:56,495 --> 00:10:58,658
- HOW DID YOU GET INTO 
THIS LINE OF WORK?

314
00:10:58,658 --> 00:10:59,939
narrator: BUT, OF COURSE,

315
00:10:59,939 --> 00:11:01,981
HE'D ALSO YET TO FIGURE OUT 
SHE WAS A PROSTITUTE.

316
00:11:01,981 --> 00:11:04,263
- WELL, I WAS BURIED IN LOAN 
DEBT FROM BUSINESS SCHOOL,

317
00:11:04,263 --> 00:11:06,305
SO I STARTED WHORING MYSELF OUT.

318
00:11:06,305 --> 00:11:07,907
narrator: 
NOT THAT THERE WEREN'T CLUES.

319
00:11:07,907 --> 00:11:11,070
- WHAT DO YOU SAY WE GO UP TO 
MY ROOM AND SEAL THE DEAL?

320
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:12,431
- YOU'RE STAYIN' HERE, HUH?

321
00:11:12,431 --> 00:11:14,033
I WAS ACTUALLY HOPING TO GET 
INTO YOUR BUSINESS TOMORROW.

322
00:11:14,033 --> 00:11:16,836
IT WOULD GIVE YOU A CHANCE TO 
MEET EVERYBODY IN THE OFFICE.

323
00:11:16,836 --> 00:11:19,118
'CAUSE YOU'RE GONNA BE WORKING 
FOR THE WHOLE STAFF.

324
00:11:19,118 --> 00:11:20,479
YOU'RE GONNA BE FILLING 
THREE OPENINGS.

325
00:11:20,479 --> 00:11:21,000
- OH!

326
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,842
I HEARD THERE WERE 
A COUPLE OF GIRLS LIKE ME

327
00:11:22,842 --> 00:11:24,563
CONSULTING OVER AT ENRON.

328
00:11:24,563 --> 00:11:25,845
narrator: AND SO THE NEXT DAY,

329
00:11:25,845 --> 00:11:28,407
MICHAEL INTRODUCED HIS NEW 
CONSULTANT TO HIS STAFF,

330
00:11:28,407 --> 00:11:30,409
WHO WEREN'T THAT PLEASED 
TO MEET HER.

331
00:11:30,409 --> 00:11:32,331
- YOU HIRED SOMEONE ELSE? 
- YES.

332
00:11:32,331 --> 00:11:33,893
- WE HAVEN'T EVEN BEEN PAID YET.

333
00:11:33,893 --> 00:11:35,254
- THAT'S EXACTLY WHY 
I HIRED HER--

334
00:11:35,254 --> 00:11:36,455
TO HELP OUT 
WITH THE FINANCES.

335
00:11:36,455 --> 00:11:38,537
SHE'S ABSOLUTELY AMAZING 
AT THAT STUFF. RIGHT?

336
00:11:38,537 --> 00:11:40,099
YOU DO DO FINANCES 
AND STUFF, RIGHT?

337
00:11:40,099 --> 00:11:42,221
- I DO ALL SORTS OF SCENES.

338
00:11:42,221 --> 00:11:43,702
- THERE YOU GO. OKAY, GUYS.

339
00:11:43,702 --> 00:11:45,464
DON'T BE AFRAID TO PUT HER 
IN ANY POSITION

340
00:11:45,464 --> 00:11:46,265
THAT YOU WANT, OKAY?

341
00:11:46,265 --> 00:11:49,708
DAVE, YOU GIVE HER ACCESS 
TO EVERYTHING, OKAY?

342
00:11:49,708 --> 00:11:52,631
I WANT YOU GUYS TO THINK OF HER 
AS NELLIE BLUTH, ALL RIGHT?

343
00:11:52,631 --> 00:11:54,353
IN FACT, WE SHOULD PROBABLY 
GET AN I.D.

344
00:11:54,353 --> 00:11:56,035
WITH THAT PRINTED ON IT, OKAY?

345
00:11:56,035 --> 00:11:56,996
[phone rings]

346
00:11:56,996 --> 00:11:58,557
narrator: BUT SHE DID 
HAVE A LIST OF "WON'TS."

347
00:11:58,557 --> 00:12:00,399
- WE'RE GONNA HAVE SOME 
GROUND RULES FIRST, OKAY?

348
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:04,443
NO [bleep], [bleep]ING 
OR [bleep]ING

349
00:12:04,443 --> 00:12:08,167
AND NO [bleep] UNLESS 
YOU'RE WEARING A [bleep]

350
00:12:08,167 --> 00:12:10,289
OR YOU [bleep] 
BEFORE YOU [bleep] ME.

351
00:12:10,289 --> 00:12:11,690
AND IF THIS WINDS UP 
ON THE WEB,

352
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:14,693
I WILL [bleep] 
YOU IN THE [bleep].

353
00:12:14,693 --> 00:12:15,775
[women gasping]

354
00:12:15,775 --> 00:12:17,576
- OUR COMPUTERS DON'T EVEN 
WORK ON THE INTERNET.

355
00:12:17,576 --> 00:12:18,898
- WHO'S FIRST?

356
00:12:20,419 --> 00:12:22,581
narrator: BACK AT THE MODEL 
HOME, GEORGE MICHAEL WAS STILL

357
00:12:22,581 --> 00:12:24,583
TRYING TO MAKE HIS 
ACCIDENTAL MARRIAGE WORK.

358
00:12:24,583 --> 00:12:26,705
- I THOUGHT MAYBE TONIGHT 
WE COULD POP IN AN [bleep]

359
00:12:26,705 --> 00:12:28,547
IN THE OLD DVD PLAYER 
AND SIT AND WATCH IT,

360
00:12:28,547 --> 00:12:31,470
MAYBE JUST THE TWO OF US, 
HUSBAND AND WIFE?

361
00:12:31,470 --> 00:12:32,551
I'M JUST KIDDING.

362
00:12:32,551 --> 00:12:34,433
I MEAN, THE STATE OF 
CALIFORNIA ISN'T, BUT--

363
00:12:34,433 --> 00:12:35,915
YOU KNOW, THAT'S WHAT 
MAKES IT FUNNY.

364
00:12:35,915 --> 00:12:38,357
- I'M WORRIED YOU'RE 
TAKING THIS TOO SERIOUSLY.

365
00:12:38,357 --> 00:12:39,718
- [chuckles] ARE--

366
00:12:39,718 --> 00:12:41,921
JUST THE OPPOSITE.

367
00:12:41,921 --> 00:12:44,323
[cell phone chiming 
"Wedding March"]

368
00:12:46,125 --> 00:12:47,406
- WHAT THE HELL IS THAT?

369
00:12:47,406 --> 00:12:50,569
- I BOUGHT YOU 
A WEDDING RING...TONE.

370
00:12:50,569 --> 00:12:53,252
[chuckles] 
OPPOSITE OF SERIOUS.

371
00:12:53,252 --> 00:12:55,174
narrator: AND MICHAEL 
WAS GETTING AN UPDATE

372
00:12:55,174 --> 00:12:58,497
ON HOW HIS NEWEST EMPLOYEE, 
NELLIE, WAS WORKING OUT.

373
00:12:58,497 --> 00:13:00,379
- REALLY? AND ALL THE GUYS 
LIKE HER, HUH? THAT IS--

374
00:13:00,379 --> 00:13:01,500
THAT IS GREAT.

375
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:03,943
UH, YOU MEAN 
"AWAY" THOUGH, RIGHT?

376
00:13:03,943 --> 00:13:06,145
BECAUSE OTHERWISE 
IT SOUNDS A LITTLE DIFFERENT.

377
00:13:06,145 --> 00:13:09,388
BUT, UH, THAT'S, UH-- 
THAT'S OUTSTANDING.

378
00:13:09,388 --> 00:13:11,150
REAL GOOD. 
YOU FORGOT TO SAY "AWAY" AGAIN.

379
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:14,193
BUT, UH, LISTEN, LET ME CALL YOU 
BACK IN A BIT, OKAY? BYE.

380
00:13:14,193 --> 00:13:17,997
[sighs] 
NELLIE HAS BLOWN THEM ALL AWAY.

381
00:13:17,997 --> 00:13:19,999
- YEAH, WELL, 
I THINK IT'S CRAZY.

382
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:21,600
YOU'VE GIVEN HER ACCESS 
TO EVERYTHING--

383
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,842
THE BANKING-- 
AND FOR WHAT?

384
00:13:22,842 --> 00:13:24,924
I MEAN, YOU'RE BASING THIS WHOLE 
THING ON THE FACT THAT

385
00:13:24,924 --> 00:13:27,166
SHE SHARES A NAME WITH SOMEONE 
YOU PLAYED WITH AS A BABY.

386
00:13:27,166 --> 00:13:29,168
- LINDSAY, I CAN TELL 
THAT IT'S REAL.

387
00:13:29,168 --> 00:13:31,770
IT'S LIKE THAT FEELING THAT 
YOU READ ABOUT TWINS HAVING.

388
00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:32,771
- WE'RE TWINS.

389
00:13:32,771 --> 00:13:34,293
YOU DIDN'T GIVE ME ACCESS 
TO THE BANKING.

390
00:13:34,293 --> 00:13:35,654
- NO, YOU JUST--YOU'D GO OUT

391
00:13:35,654 --> 00:13:37,937
AND YOU'D JUST WHORE IT UP, 
LINDSAY, YOU KNOW?

392
00:13:37,937 --> 00:13:40,179
NOW, SHE'S DIFFERENT. 
SHE'S A LITTLE BIT MORE LIKE ME.

393
00:13:40,179 --> 00:13:41,580
IT'S LIKE WE FINISH EACH 
OTHER'S--

394
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:43,142
- SANDWICHES?

395
00:13:43,142 --> 00:13:46,545
- SENTENCES. 
WHY WOULD I SAY--

396
00:13:46,545 --> 00:13:47,626
- SANDWICHES?

397
00:13:47,626 --> 00:13:50,309
- THAT TIME I WAS GONNA 
SAY SANDWICHES.

398
00:13:50,309 --> 00:13:52,591
- SO I GUESS YOU HAVEN'T TOLD 
NELLIE WHAT YOU'RE THINKING.

399
00:13:52,591 --> 00:13:53,232
- NO, I HAVE NOT.

400
00:13:53,232 --> 00:13:54,713
I'VE BEEN WAITING 
FOR THE RIGHT TIME.

401
00:13:54,713 --> 00:13:56,435
I WANT TO MAKE SURE SHE 
TRUSTS ME, YOU KNOW,

402
00:13:56,435 --> 00:13:58,397
ESPECIALLY SINCE DAD 
IS PROBABLY SETTING HER UP.

403
00:13:58,397 --> 00:14:00,439
BUT I MIGHT WANT TO HURRY 
WITH THAT WHOLE OPERATION

404
00:14:00,439 --> 00:14:02,561
BECAUSE SHE'S CHARGING US 
A FORTUNE,

405
00:14:02,561 --> 00:14:03,802
AND SHE'S GOT THIS OLD BOSS

406
00:14:03,802 --> 00:14:05,404
THAT'S CLAIMING 
HE WANTS A PERCENTAGE.

407
00:14:05,404 --> 00:14:06,565
- YO, MAN, YOU OWE ME MONEY.

408
00:14:06,565 --> 00:14:07,726
I AIN'T NO DUMMY.

409
00:14:07,726 --> 00:14:08,847
AND IT BETTER BE SOON,

410
00:14:08,847 --> 00:14:11,850
OR YOU'RE GONNA FEEL MY HAND 
UP YOUR [bleep].

411
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:14,053
- SO NELLIE WANTS TO 
MEET ME TONIGHT FOR DRINKS.

412
00:14:14,053 --> 00:14:15,014
MAYBE I'LL TELL HER THEN.

413
00:14:15,014 --> 00:14:17,256
- THAT'S FUNNY. I'M GOING 
OUT TONIGHT FOR DRINKS TOO--

414
00:14:17,256 --> 00:14:18,377
WITH AN EXCITING NEW MAN.

415
00:14:18,377 --> 00:14:20,860
- REALLY TRYING TO MAKE THAT 
MARRIAGE WORK, AREN'T YOU?

416
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,421
- WELL, EXCUSE ME, 
JUDGE REINHOLD,

417
00:14:22,421 --> 00:14:24,143
BUT I'M FEELING 
A LITTLE PRESSURE HERE.

418
00:14:24,143 --> 00:14:26,225
I MEAN, IF YOU HAD TO HAVE SEX 
WITH TOBIAS IN FOUR MONTHS,

419
00:14:26,225 --> 00:14:27,666
YOU'D BE SHOPPING 
FOR A WAY OUT TOO.

420
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:29,869
- I STAND CORRECTED 
AND DISGUSTED.

421
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:31,070
- [sighs]

422
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:33,472
narrator: AND MICHAEL ARRIVED 
FOR HIS MEETING WITH NELLIE.

423
00:14:33,472 --> 00:14:34,673
- ARE YOU MICHAEL? 
- YES.

424
00:14:34,673 --> 00:14:36,795
- THERE'S A NELLIE AT THE END 
OF THE BAR WANTS TO SEE YOU.

425
00:14:36,795 --> 00:14:38,237
- GREAT. THANK YOU.

426
00:14:38,237 --> 00:14:39,038
OH, IT'S TOBIAS.

427
00:14:39,038 --> 00:14:42,161
- MICHAEL. 
LOOK, THIS HAS GOT TO STOP.

428
00:14:42,161 --> 00:14:45,324
I MEAN, FLATTERED? YES. 
INTERESTED? NOT TONIGHT.

429
00:14:45,324 --> 00:14:47,366
- I-I THINK I-I SEE 
WHAT'S HAPPENING.

430
00:14:47,366 --> 00:14:49,048
YOU'RE MEETING 
GIRL-MICHAEL AT THE BAR?

431
00:14:49,048 --> 00:14:50,249
- IT WAS HER IDEA.

432
00:14:50,249 --> 00:14:52,731
SHE WANTED TO GET A DRINK, 
AND I KNOW IT'S CRAZY.

433
00:14:52,731 --> 00:14:55,374
I MEAN, I'M MARRIED. 
AND THE CARBS.

434
00:14:55,374 --> 00:14:58,657
- WELL, TOBIAS, SOMETIMES LIFE 
IS ABOUT MAKING DIFFICULT--

435
00:14:58,657 --> 00:15:00,699
- SANDWICHES. I KNOW.

436
00:15:00,699 --> 00:15:03,462
- YOU READ MY MIND. 
- OH, GOD. HERE SHE IS.

437
00:15:05,744 --> 00:15:08,267
- NEXT TO THAT GUY? 
- UH, WHAT GUY?

438
00:15:08,267 --> 00:15:10,269
- THAT GUY.

439
00:15:10,269 --> 00:15:13,632
- NO, THAT'S HER. 
- HIM?

440
00:15:13,632 --> 00:15:15,634
- THAT'S A GIRL.

441
00:15:15,634 --> 00:15:18,797
I-I THINK THE NAME MICHAEL 
IS MAKING YOU LOOK FOR A MAN.

442
00:15:18,797 --> 00:15:21,240
- THINK I'M LOOKIN' AT A MAN. 
- MICHAEL.

443
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:22,962
- YES? 
- YES.

444
00:15:22,962 --> 00:15:24,203
- NO, I MEANT GIRL-MICHAEL.

445
00:15:24,203 --> 00:15:25,124
- I'M GONNA LEAVE YOU TWO ALONE.

446
00:15:25,124 --> 00:15:26,725
- SO NICE TO MEET YOU, 
GIRL-MICHAEL.

447
00:15:26,725 --> 00:15:28,167
[cell phone rings]

448
00:15:28,167 --> 00:15:30,649
- WHAT? 
YES? HI, NELLIE.

449
00:15:30,649 --> 00:15:33,292
I WAS THINKING THAT WE 
COULD MEET DOWN HERE.

450
00:15:33,292 --> 00:15:35,734
UH, ACTUALLY, I THINK 
I'M GONNA COME UP.

451
00:15:35,734 --> 00:15:37,216
- I REALLY NEED TO SEE YOU.

452
00:15:37,216 --> 00:15:38,777
- YEAH, I REALLY WANT 
TO SEE YOU TOO.

453
00:15:38,777 --> 00:15:40,379
THERE'S SOMETHING WE NEED 
TO TALK ABOUT.

454
00:15:40,379 --> 00:15:42,101
- I'VE ALWAYS BEEN MILDLY 
ATTRACTED TO YOU.

455
00:15:42,101 --> 00:15:43,262
- WHAT?

456
00:15:43,262 --> 00:15:44,263
- WELL, LET'S FACE IT.

457
00:15:44,263 --> 00:15:46,265
THERE'S NO DENYING THAT 
THERE'S A HEAT BETWEEN US.

458
00:15:46,265 --> 00:15:47,386
- I'D LIKE TO DENY THAT.

459
00:15:47,386 --> 00:15:50,229
- I KNOW YOU FEEL IT TOO-- 
THIS BURNING DESIRE.

460
00:15:50,229 --> 00:15:51,590
- I-I-I DON'T FEEL ANYTHING.

461
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:53,872
I-I FEEL A BURNING 
MUTUAL RESPECT.

462
00:15:53,872 --> 00:15:54,994
- I'VE GOT AN OUTFIT

463
00:15:54,994 --> 00:15:56,956
THAT'S GONNA TURN THAT RESPECT 
INTO SOMETHING FUN.

464
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:59,038
- RESPECT IS FUN, NELLIE.

465
00:15:59,038 --> 00:16:01,200
YOU'RE GONNA WANT THE RESPECT 
WHEN YOU HEAR WHERE I--

466
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,481
WHERE IS THE LIGHT?

467
00:16:02,481 --> 00:16:04,523
- DON'T TOUCH THAT LIGHT! 
- WHAT?

468
00:16:04,523 --> 00:16:05,684
- THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS

469
00:16:05,684 --> 00:16:08,447
WHEN YOU STEAL FROM FRANK'S 
STABLE WITHOUT PAYIN'.

470
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:10,929
YOU WANT TO BE HER PIMP, 
YOU GOTTA SETTLE UP WITH ME.

471
00:16:10,929 --> 00:16:12,251
- PIMP? YOU MEAN THAT SHE'S A--

472
00:16:12,251 --> 00:16:14,773
- LADY OF THE EVENING. 
WORKING GIRL.

473
00:16:14,773 --> 00:16:17,256
SHE TURNS ILLUSIONS 
FOR MONEY.

474
00:16:17,256 --> 00:16:19,698
narrator: AND THAT'S WHEN 
MICHAEL RECOGNIZED THE VOICE.

475
00:16:19,698 --> 00:16:21,100
- TRICKS. 
- WAIT A MINUTE.

476
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:22,141
- DON'T YOU DO IT!

477
00:16:22,141 --> 00:16:23,942
AIN'T NOBODY GONNA SEE 
WHAT FRANK LOOK LIKE!

478
00:16:23,942 --> 00:16:25,904
- FRANKLIN IS FRANK?

479
00:16:25,904 --> 00:16:28,267
- [singing] MR. "F"

480
00:16:31,870 --> 00:16:34,353
narrator: MICHAEL HAD JUST 
DISCOVERED THAT HIS BROTHER

481
00:16:34,353 --> 00:16:37,356
WAS THE PIMP FOR THE WOMAN 
HE THOUGHT WAS HIS SISTER.

482
00:16:37,356 --> 00:16:39,958
- WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON? 
NELLIE IS NOT A PROSTITUTE.

483
00:16:39,958 --> 00:16:41,040
- OF COURSE SHE IS.

484
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,921
OH, BUT I CAN SEE WHAT 
THE MISUNDERSTANDING IS.

485
00:16:42,921 --> 00:16:43,722
YOU DIDN'T KNOW.

486
00:16:43,722 --> 00:16:45,884
MAYBE WE CAN GIVE HIM 
A FAMILY DISCOUNT!

487
00:16:45,884 --> 00:16:47,206
- FAMILY DISCOUNT IS RIGHT, 
GOB.

488
00:16:47,206 --> 00:16:49,128
THIS IS THE SISTER THAT 
I'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT.

489
00:16:49,128 --> 00:16:51,050
- MAYBE I SHOULD'VE BEEN 
GETTING A FAMILY RATE.

490
00:16:51,050 --> 00:16:53,132
OH, MY GOD!

491
00:16:53,132 --> 00:16:54,213
- HOW DO YOU KNOW HER?

492
00:16:54,213 --> 00:16:55,614
- MET UP WITH HER 
AFTER A SHOW.

493
00:16:55,614 --> 00:16:56,935
- AND YOU DID THINGS WITH HER?

494
00:16:56,935 --> 00:16:57,976
narrator: HE DIDN'T.

495
00:16:57,976 --> 00:16:58,977
- I DID.

496
00:16:58,977 --> 00:17:00,419
narrator: WELL, IF YOU CONSIDER

497
00:17:00,419 --> 00:17:02,461
CRYING LIKE A GIRL 
DOING SOMETHING.

498
00:17:02,461 --> 00:17:04,423
- I JUST WANT MY BROTHER 
TO RESPECT ME, YOU KNOW.

499
00:17:04,423 --> 00:17:06,745
I MEAN, 
I DON'T EVEN HAVE A JOB.

500
00:17:06,745 --> 00:17:08,627
- LOOK, I COULD USE 
A MAN'S VOICE ON THE PHONE,

501
00:17:08,627 --> 00:17:11,470
AND I LIKE 
YOUR LITTLE PUPPET SHOW.

502
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:14,233
- AIN'T SO LITTLE WHEN I 
TAKE MY PANTS OFF, LADY.

503
00:17:14,233 --> 00:17:17,636
I MEAN, OBVIOUSLY I'D TAKE 
SOME OF THE CRY OUT OF THAT.

504
00:17:17,636 --> 00:17:19,878
BUT I AM NOT A PIMP, 
MICHAEL.

505
00:17:19,878 --> 00:17:21,040
SHE NEEDED PROTECTION,

506
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:24,043
SO I MAKE SOME THREATS, 
I WEAR THIS HAT,

507
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:26,245
AND I COLLECT MY 10%.

508
00:17:26,245 --> 00:17:30,049
- YEAH, THAT'S A PIMP, 
AND OUR SISTER IS A PROSTITUTE.

509
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:32,251
- I'M YOUR SISTER? 
- I THINK SO.

510
00:17:32,251 --> 00:17:34,213
I FOUND YOU 
IN MY DAD'S COMPUTER.

511
00:17:34,213 --> 00:17:36,135
I THOUGHT THAT MAYBE 
HE WAS EMBEZZLING MONEY

512
00:17:36,135 --> 00:17:37,256
AND TAKING ADVANTAGE OF YOU.

513
00:17:37,256 --> 00:17:39,578
AND THAT'S WHY I HIRED YOU 
TO DO YOUR WORK AT THE OFFICE.

514
00:17:39,578 --> 00:17:40,579
- OH, MY GOD.

515
00:17:40,579 --> 00:17:42,861
- WAIT A MINUTE. WHAT--WHAT KIND 
OF WORK DID YOU DO?

516
00:17:42,861 --> 00:17:45,304
NO WONDER 
THEY WERE SO HAPPY.

517
00:17:45,304 --> 00:17:47,426
- I'M SO EMBARRASSED!

518
00:17:47,426 --> 00:17:48,947
- NELLIE, HANG ON A SECOND.

519
00:17:48,947 --> 00:17:51,630
YOU KNOW, GOB, THIS MIGHT BE 
THAT SIGN FROM GOD

520
00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:53,912
THAT YOU SHOULD CHANGE 
YOUR WAYS.

521
00:17:53,912 --> 00:17:56,555
- NO, I THINK THAT'S GONNA 
BE SOMETHING BIG.

522
00:17:56,555 --> 00:17:58,157
narrator: DOWNSTAIRS, MEANWHILE,

523
00:17:58,157 --> 00:18:00,319
LINDSAY ARRIVED 
AT THE BAR FOR HER DATE.

524
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:01,320
- MICHAEL.

525
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:02,481
OH, MY GOD! 
MY HUSBAND!

526
00:18:02,481 --> 00:18:03,482
- OH, MY GOD! MY WIFE!

527
00:18:03,482 --> 00:18:04,883
ARE YOU TWO HERE 
FOR EACH OTHER?

528
00:18:04,883 --> 00:18:06,165
- IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE DOING?

529
00:18:06,165 --> 00:18:08,727
- HOW DARE YOU! 
- HOW DARE YOU!

530
00:18:08,727 --> 00:18:11,090
- AND WITH ANOTHER MAN! 
- AND WITH ANOTHER WOMAN!

531
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:13,212
- WAIT, WAIT. 
YOU DIDN'T PLAN THIS TOGETHER?

532
00:18:13,212 --> 00:18:15,734
I JUST ASSUMED YOU WANTED 
A HOLY TRINITY.

533
00:18:15,734 --> 00:18:16,815
- ABSOLUTELY NOT!

534
00:18:16,815 --> 00:18:18,857
WE'RE A HAPPILY MARRIED 
COUPLE.

535
00:18:18,857 --> 00:18:21,100
- YES, WHO HAPPEN TO BE VERY 
MUCH IN LOVE WITH EACH OTHER.

536
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:23,502
- WELL, YOU'RE STILL GONNA 
HAVE TO PAY FRANK.

537
00:18:25,344 --> 00:18:27,306
narrator: AND MICHAEL 
CONFRONTED HIS FATHER.

538
00:18:27,306 --> 00:18:28,427
- I KNOW WHO N. BLUTH IS.

539
00:18:28,427 --> 00:18:31,029
IT IS NELLIE, 
AND I FOUND HER.

540
00:18:31,029 --> 00:18:33,752
- THAT'S YOUR SISSY 
COUSIN LARRY.

541
00:18:33,752 --> 00:18:34,793
EVEN THEN WE KNEW.

542
00:18:34,793 --> 00:18:36,315
THAT'S WHY WE 
CALLED HIM NELLIE.

543
00:18:36,315 --> 00:18:38,157
DO YOU NOT KNOW THAT EXPRESSION, 
MICHAEL?

544
00:18:38,157 --> 00:18:39,198
I THOUGHT WE WERE 
ON THE SAME PAGE HERE.

545
00:18:39,198 --> 00:18:40,319
- IT'S A NICE TRY, POP,

546
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:41,760
BUT IN YOUR OLD COMPUTER 
I FOUND A NELLIE.

547
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:44,163
YOU'RE TRYIN' TO TELL ME THAT 
THAT IS NOT MY SISTER?

548
00:18:44,163 --> 00:18:45,644
- YES. 
IT'S PERFECTLY INNOCENT.

549
00:18:45,644 --> 00:18:47,246
SHE'S MY PROSTITUTE.

550
00:18:47,246 --> 00:18:48,447
I'M A RED-BLOODED MAN.

551
00:18:48,447 --> 00:18:50,809
I HAVE CERTAIN NEEDS THAT 
YOUR MOM CAN'T SATISFY.

552
00:18:50,809 --> 00:18:53,252
narrator: 
BUT SEX WASN'T ONE OF THEM.

553
00:18:53,252 --> 00:18:57,256
- [crying] I JUST WANT MY 
BROTHER TO HAND ME MY MONEY.

554
00:18:57,256 --> 00:18:58,697
BUT HE'S GOT THAT HAIR.

555
00:18:58,697 --> 00:19:02,501
WHY CAN'T I HAVE HAIR AND MONEY, 
AND HIM NOTHING?

556
00:19:02,501 --> 00:19:03,902
[crying]

557
00:19:03,902 --> 00:19:06,305
- SHE'S NOT MY SISTER. 
I LET HER INTO THE COMPANY.

558
00:19:06,305 --> 00:19:08,347
- YOU DIDN'T GIVE HER ACCESS 
TO THE CASH, DID YOU?

559
00:19:08,347 --> 00:19:10,829
- SHE SAID SHE LIKED ME.

560
00:19:10,829 --> 00:19:11,950
- SHE'S A PROSTITUTE.

561
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:15,954
THAT'S HER JOB. OH, NO. 
THE N. BLUTH ACCOUNT.

562
00:19:15,954 --> 00:19:17,276
- WHAT? 
THE N. BLUTH ACCOUNT?

563
00:19:17,276 --> 00:19:18,797
THAT IS YOUR ACCOUNT?

564
00:19:18,797 --> 00:19:20,479
- MAYBE. BUT IT'S ONLY 
EMBEZZLEMENT

565
00:19:20,479 --> 00:19:23,041
IF YOU SPEND IT 
OUTSIDE THE COMPANY.

566
00:19:23,041 --> 00:19:23,922
[beeping]

567
00:19:23,922 --> 00:19:25,844
IT'S GONE. 
IT'S EMPTY.

568
00:19:25,844 --> 00:19:26,765
SHE GOT TO IT.

569
00:19:26,765 --> 00:19:28,167
- WELL, THERE GOES THE COMPANY.

570
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:29,808
- OKAY. NOW, HOLD ON NOW.

571
00:19:29,808 --> 00:19:33,812
LET'S NOT PANIC BECAUSE I-I KNOW 
SOMEONE WHO CAN FIND HER.

572
00:19:33,812 --> 00:19:34,813
HIS NAME IS FRANK.

573
00:19:34,813 --> 00:19:37,176
- THAT'S GOB'S PUPPET.

574
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:39,898
- I'M GOING TO PRISON.

575
00:19:39,898 --> 00:19:42,140
YOU HAVEN'T HEARD FROM OSCAR 
LATELY, HAVE YOU?

576
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:43,742
- NO. 
- OKAY.

577
00:19:43,742 --> 00:19:46,185
narrator: AND THE NEXT DAY 
MICHAEL RETURNED TO THE OFFICE

578
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:49,388
TO TELL THE EMPLOYEES THAT BLACK 
FRIDAY HAD INDEED ARRIVED.

579
00:19:49,388 --> 00:19:51,430
- HEY, TED. 
WHAT'S GOIN' ON?

580
00:19:51,430 --> 00:19:52,871
- NELLIE GOT ALL OF US 
OUR CHECKS

581
00:19:52,871 --> 00:19:54,313
AND THESE GREAT NEW COMPUTERS.

582
00:19:54,313 --> 00:19:56,995
- EXCUSE ME. 
NELLIE, YOU DID THIS?

583
00:19:56,995 --> 00:19:58,717
- I TOOK IT OUT OF 
THE N. BLUTH ACCOUNT.

584
00:19:58,717 --> 00:20:00,319
IF YOU SPEND IT 
WITHIN THE COMPANY,

585
00:20:00,319 --> 00:20:01,800
IT GIVES 
THE PROSECUTORS NOTHING.

586
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,001
ALSO, IT WAS THE ONLY WAY

587
00:20:03,001 --> 00:20:04,843
TO GET MYSELF THE 10 GRAND 
THAT YOU OWED ME.

588
00:20:04,843 --> 00:20:05,844
- TEN GRAND?

589
00:20:05,844 --> 00:20:07,446
WHAT--WHAT DID YOU DO 
WITH THESE GUYS EXACTLY?

590
00:20:07,446 --> 00:20:08,647
- THEY MOSTLY JUST CRIED.

591
00:20:08,647 --> 00:20:10,809
YOU'VE GOT A REAL 
MORALE PROBLEM HERE.

592
00:20:10,809 --> 00:20:12,371
- YOU CRIED?

593
00:20:14,012 --> 00:20:15,694
LISTEN, I THOUGHT 
THAT YOU WERE GOING TO--

594
00:20:15,694 --> 00:20:17,256
- STEAL IT? 
- YES.

595
00:20:17,256 --> 00:20:19,538
- BUT I MIGHT BE YOUR SISTER, 
REMEMBER?

596
00:20:19,538 --> 00:20:21,300
- WELL, THE FACT THAT YOU DIDN'T 
STEAL IT

597
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:23,181
MIGHT ACTUALLY BE PROOF 
THAT YOU'RE NOT.

598
00:20:23,181 --> 00:20:24,423
EVEN IF WE'RE NOT RELATED,

599
00:20:24,423 --> 00:20:26,585
I THINK I WOULD LIKE FOR YOU 
TO WORK HERE.

600
00:20:26,585 --> 00:20:28,427
YOU'RE VERY, 
VERY GOOD AT IT,

601
00:20:28,427 --> 00:20:29,828
AND WHAT YOU DO FOR A JOB

602
00:20:29,828 --> 00:20:32,471
IS NOT REALLY A GREAT WAY 
TO MAKE A LIVING, YOU KNOW?

603
00:20:32,471 --> 00:20:34,112
- I MAKE 300 GRAND A YEAR.

604
00:20:34,112 --> 00:20:36,235
- MARRY ME!

605
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:38,196
IT'S WEIRD 
ON SO MANY LEVELS.

606
00:20:38,196 --> 00:20:40,719
narrator: ON THE NEXT 
"ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT."

607
00:20:40,719 --> 00:20:42,761
GOB HAS A RELIGIOUS CONVERSION.

608
00:20:42,761 --> 00:20:45,444
- I'VE SEEN A SIGN, 
AND I WANT TO MAKE THIS WORK.

609
00:20:45,444 --> 00:20:48,407
A COMMITTED RELATIONSHIP 
THAT ACTUALLY MEANS SOMETHING.

610
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:54,733
HOW ABOUT YOU? YOU WANT TO DO 
JUST THE TWO OF US?

611
00:20:54,733 --> 00:20:58,617
narrator: AND BUSTER'S FAKE COMA 
IS PUT TO ITS GREATEST TEST.

612
00:21:02,341 --> 00:21:04,182
- DON'T YOU YOU DIE ON ME. 
DON'T YOU DIE ON ME.

613
00:21:04,182 --> 00:21:05,824
narrator: OH, MY.

614
00:21:10,148 --> 00:21:12,110
- [singing] WATCH US, WATCH US 
WATCH US, WATCH US

615
00:21:12,110 --> 00:21:14,112
WATCH US, WATCH US

616
00:21:14,112 --> 00:21:19,117
OH, MY, OH, MY 
PARDONNEZ-MOI

617
00:21:19,117 --> 00:21:24,843
YOU'RE GONNA MAKE ME CRY 
OH, MY, OH, MY

618
00:21:24,843 --> 00:21:27,165
JUST YOU AND ME

619
00:21:27,165 --> 00:21:30,168
AND ONE MORE IS THREE 
[chuckles]

620
00:21:30,168 --> 00:21:33,812
YOU AND YOU AND ME

621
00:21:33,812 --> 00:21:38,136
OH, MY, OH, MY 
PARDONNEZ-MOI
