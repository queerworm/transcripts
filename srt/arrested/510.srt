The place was wall-to-wall nerds.

{\an8}Yeah, this is making sense.

{\an8}Remember when I said I fired everybody?

56
00:02:30,191 --> 00:02:34,904
{\an8}What I did was, I asked Joan
in HR to fire everybody for me.

57
00:02:35,071 --> 00:02:36,656
{\an8}Then, so I didn't have to make
two phone calls,

58
00:02:36,739 --> 00:02:38,074
{\an8}I fired her there on the spot.

59
00:02:38,533 --> 00:02:41,202
{\an8}-So you fired the person in charge of...
-Firing.

60
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:44,956
{\an8}Yes. So, you know,
you fire the person in HR last.

61
00:02:45,123 --> 00:02:46,166
{\an8}That's the lesson here.

62
00:02:46,249 --> 00:02:48,251
{\an8}But, hey, this is how you learn
in business, am I right?

63
00:02:48,334 --> 00:02:50,253
{\an8}We're still somehow paying these people?

64
00:02:50,336 --> 00:02:53,298
{\an8}Well, we're not paying Joan in HR.
Gotta give me credit for that one.

65
00:02:53,381 --> 00:02:55,466
Well, we're not gonna have
any more credit at all.

66
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:57,760
That explains why Maeby's
credit cards aren't working.

67

68
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:03,641

I become...

New neighbors every six to eight months.

81
00:03:32,003 --> 00:03:34,797
Also, Maeby doesn't even have
a high school diploma.

82
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:38,092
Not a good move, given the world
my generation is leaving hers.

00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:46,864
[Oscar] <i>This is a great pad.</i>

163
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:49,534
I know.
This is what we in the Bluth family

164
00:06:49,617 --> 00:06:52,412
-call a "Don't Tell Michael."
-[all laugh]

165
00:06:52,495 --> 00:06:54,539
[Ron] <i>But their new roommate wanted out.</i>

166
00:06:54,789 --> 00:06:56,249
Maybe I'll go make us some popcorn.

167
00:06:56,332 --> 00:06:58,501
Oh. Are we gonna go in the kitchen?

168
00:06:58,584 --> 00:07:01,003
We're gonna, I don't know,
boil some hot oil?

169
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:04,215
[laughs] Nice try, bitch.

170
00:07:04,298 --> 00:07:06,384
Yeah, nice try, B.

171
00:07:06,676 --> 00:07:10,555
-I'd love some popcorn, please.
-[Oscar] Hey, smart guy.

172
00:07:10,638 --> 00:07:12,014
Can we watch a movie,

173
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:14,684
or just leave the lights on
so we can't see you?

174
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:17,728
We can stay up late if you want
and watch it, or something.

175
00:07:17,812 --> 00:07:20,148
-[woman] Thanks for dinner, Annette.
-[door rattles]

176
00:07:20,231 --> 00:07:24,152
-[Maeby] See you next time, Bev.
-I thought you said you lived here alone.

177
00:07:24,235 --> 00:07:25,987
It's my old lady.
Leave her out of it, please?

178
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:27,488
She's a very sweet person.

179
00:07:27,572 --> 00:07:29,782
She's smiling all the time,
even when she sleeps.

180
00:07:29,866 --> 00:07:31,033
[Maeby] I always get the wrong key.

181
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:32,910
-On my cue, rising.
-[Buster] Mm...

182
00:07:34,996 --> 00:07:36,998
[Oscar] And in three, two, one.

183
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:41,043
[all] Inside, outside.
Inside, outside. Inside, outside.

184
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:43,171
Outside. Inside, outside.

185
00:07:43,254 --> 00:07:46,549
-You blow our cover, and she's a goner.
-[whimpering] Inside, outside.

186
00:07:47,884 --> 00:07:49,177
[rattling]

187
00:07:50,011 --> 00:07:51,179
Run, Annette, run!

188
00:07:51,262 --> 00:07:53,598
-[gasps] Maeby? Why'd he call you Annette?
-[gasps]

189
00:07:53,681 --> 00:07:55,808
-[alarm blaring]
-Huh? [grunts]

190
00:07:55,892 --> 00:07:56,893
[gasps]

191
00:07:57,894 --> 00:07:58,895
Hand.

192
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:01,272
[both] Inside, outside. Inside, outside.

193
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:03,399
And this is why I told you
to buy the safety hair.

194
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:06,110
[Ron] <i>While Maeby was hoping</i>
<i>to erase memories...</i>

195
00:08:06,194 --> 00:08:08,154
[Maeby] Now I gotta drink the evidence.

196
00:08:08,237 --> 00:08:11,491
<i>...back at the model home,</i>
<i>Michael was bonding with his son.</i>

197
00:08:11,574 --> 00:08:14,035
You know?
You're dating the girl of my dreams.

198
00:08:14,118 --> 00:08:15,953
Your dreams. You know?

199
00:08:16,037 --> 00:08:17,997
What I meant was,
my dreams are your dreams.

200
00:08:18,372 --> 00:08:20,625
Have you ever noticed that dreams are hard
to remember?

201
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:22,126
There's one I can't forget.

202
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:24,170
The dream of us working together.
Do you remember

203
00:08:24,253 --> 00:08:27,089
how we wanted to make sure
we could hang out all day every day?

204
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:29,091
-Like you and your dad.
-That was not a dream.

205
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:30,968
Think I wanted to hang out with my father?

206
00:08:31,052 --> 00:08:33,554
That was a job.
No, but listen, I want you to know

207
00:08:33,638 --> 00:08:35,848
that I'm available to you 24 hours a day,

208
00:08:35,932 --> 00:08:37,892
any time you want,
to talk about business.

209
00:08:37,975 --> 00:08:39,727
And don't think
I can't handle the tech stuff.

210
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:42,063
I spent those five and a half weeks
up at the Search campus.

211
00:08:42,146 --> 00:08:43,856
I'm texting with one hand,
you've seen that.

212
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,942
Well,
my problems are not that easily solved.

213
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:48,152
-Oh, yeah?
-Turns out, we're way more in debt

214
00:08:48,236 --> 00:08:49,570
than I thought we were.

215
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:51,113
-Same here. [laughs softly]
-Yeah.

216
00:08:51,489 --> 00:08:53,449
I-- I'm suddenly running
the Bluth Company,

217
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:55,284
and they're up to something.
I don't know what it is,

218
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:56,285
but we're broke.

219
00:08:56,452 --> 00:08:58,454
It's just, these offices
are just wiping us out.

220
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:01,457
And same here.
Gob's got us on two floors now.

221
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:04,418
Trying to get my employees to describe
what they're doing is like pulling teeth.

222
00:09:04,502 --> 00:09:06,546
I think there are
a couple of Two Hour Teeth guys

223
00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:10,091
still on the payroll. No one will confirm,
but I'm convinced that in the break room,

224
00:09:10,174 --> 00:09:12,426
there's still an active chair.
Anyway, despite all of this,

225
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:14,929
you and I are gonna get through this.
You want to know why?

226
00:09:15,179 --> 00:09:16,847
The Bluth boys, we find a way.

227
00:09:16,931 --> 00:09:18,724
-We're winners.
-Agreed.

228
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:22,228
Hey, so, non sequitur,
what do you know about bankruptcy?

229
00:09:22,478 --> 00:09:25,356
You know, I was just checking
into that. [chuckles] No, look.

230
00:09:25,439 --> 00:09:26,857
I don't know what else I can do.

231
00:09:26,941 --> 00:09:29,735
Dad said go in there
and save the company, find money.

232
00:09:29,819 --> 00:09:32,488
But despite all their shady bookkeeping,
there's nothing left.

233
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:34,532
There's just-- there's Sudden Valley.
That's it.

234
00:09:34,615 --> 00:09:36,659
The one thing that was mine.
Well, and whatever's

235
00:09:36,742 --> 00:09:39,996
in that file, that "Gated Community,"
but... but you're different.

236
00:09:40,371 --> 00:09:41,414
You're right at the beginning.

237
00:09:41,497 --> 00:09:45,042
You shouldn't be thinking
about bankruptcy at all, you know?

238
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:47,295
Can't you get a loan?

239
00:09:47,503 --> 00:09:51,591
[sighs] Well, I mean, Rebel offered
to buy the whole company outright.

240
00:09:51,674 --> 00:09:53,509
-Oh, you can't do that.
-No. I mean...

241
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:55,469
-Forget about that.
-What if the software...

242
00:09:55,553 --> 00:09:57,179
-Is worth billions?
-...never works?

243
00:09:58,514 --> 00:09:59,432
It doesn't seem likely.

244
00:09:59,515 --> 00:10:02,393
-These expenses are just killing us.
-Hey, hang on.

245
00:10:02,935 --> 00:10:05,688
Uh, I think I got a solution
for both of us.

246
00:10:06,564 --> 00:10:08,107
[elevator bell dings]

247
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:12,361
-And... open your eyes.
-Was I supposed to close them?

248
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:14,739
Hmm? Oh, yeah. Well, anyway,

249
00:10:14,822 --> 00:10:16,866
these are the offices.
What do you think?

250
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:18,868
Oh, 'cause you're
on the fourth floor now. I...

251
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:21,579
Yeah, you set up Fakeblock here.
It's free rent.

252
00:10:22,163 --> 00:10:24,248
I don't know, I mean, you know,
this was your office.

253
00:10:24,332 --> 00:10:25,416
This was where you were president.

254
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:28,628
Where decisions were made that you...

255
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:30,171
Eventually found out about.

256
00:10:30,254 --> 00:10:32,298
But-- but, look, you know,
this was our dream, right?

257
00:10:32,381 --> 00:10:33,758
To work together? Do you remember

258
00:10:33,841 --> 00:10:35,384
-all the dreaming we did?
-Yeah.

259
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:37,094
Have lunch together.
Work out in the late afternoon.

260
00:10:37,178 --> 00:10:38,679
That's right,
we were gonna put a weight room

261
00:10:38,763 --> 00:10:40,139
-in the back office.
-You know it, yeah.

262
00:10:40,222 --> 00:10:42,308
Drive home together,
shower up, grab dinner,

263
00:10:42,391 --> 00:10:44,560
-PJs on, teeth brushed.
-A little TV.

264
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:47,563
A little bit of TV, sure,
and then a little kiss good night

265
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:49,690
and off to bed.
You know, I am just realizing

266
00:10:49,774 --> 00:10:51,651
that I'm still picturing you
as a ten-year-old.

267
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:53,194
I think I was trying to engineer

268
00:10:53,277 --> 00:10:55,655
a way to stay up late
and watch <i>The Tom Green Show.</i>

269
00:10:55,738 --> 00:10:57,573
Mm, yeah, see,
I don't get the new guys.

270
00:10:57,657 --> 00:10:59,617
Anyway, it can be a new dream,
then, you know?

271
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:02,953
I'll be able to come here all the time.
You'll be able to pop up whenever.

272
00:11:03,454 --> 00:11:05,122
I'm not sure it's a good idea, you know?

273
00:11:05,206 --> 00:11:06,707
-Yeah.
-I'm feeling anxious as it is.

274
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:08,793
This is just gonna be great, isn't it?

275
00:11:08,876 --> 00:11:10,336
It's gonna be so much fun!

276
00:11:10,419 --> 00:11:14,090
[Ron] <i>George Michael wasn't the only one</i>
<i>who felt shackled to his father.</i>

00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:16,425

outside, inside, outside,

278
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:18,052
inside, outside, inside...

279
00:11:18,135 --> 00:11:19,845
-[Buster] Hello.
-[Oscar] Oh, no.

280
00:11:19,929 --> 00:11:22,765
-[girl] Ew!
-Waving with righty. We've discussed this.

281
00:11:22,848 --> 00:11:24,183
-[Buster] Sorry.
-[Oscar] There's gotta be a way

282
00:11:24,266 --> 00:11:27,144
we can cover more ground
without attracting attention.

283
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:30,231
Oh, I've got the perfect idea for that.

284
00:11:33,442 --> 00:11:36,529
[Buster and Oscar] Wet side, dry side,
wet side, dry side, wet side, dry side...

-Okay.
-[mutters]

286
00:11:38,489 --> 00:11:40,282
Are you all right?

287
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:41,951
We should have taken
the tandem bike.

288
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:43,703
[Oscar] Nah.
Never would have fit in here.

289

[Ron] <i>George Michael</i>
<i>was showing his cousin</i>

291
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:51,544
<i>the new Fakeblock offices.</i>

292
00:11:51,627 --> 00:11:54,463
[George Michael] He wants me
to help him print things, and I...

293
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:58,217
I will say the other place had
more of a tech start-up vibe.

294
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:01,429
Yeah, but the fraud part
will be more at home here, you know?

295
00:12:01,512 --> 00:12:04,640
Yeah. If these walls could only testify,
huh? [chuckles]

296
00:12:05,933 --> 00:12:08,602
I don't understand the problem.
I thought Rebel said

297
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:09,937
she was gonna buy the company.

298
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:12,231
Well, I'm not gonna sell a bogus company
to my girlfriend.

299
00:12:12,314 --> 00:12:15,443
Why not? It's the perfect way
to end a terrible relationship.

300
00:12:15,526 --> 00:12:17,528
It's not terrible.
It's-- it's a great relationship.

301
00:12:17,611 --> 00:12:20,156
Yes, but it won't be
once you sell her a shitty company.

302
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:22,575
That's what I'm trying to tell you.
You're more impossible

303
00:12:22,658 --> 00:12:23,826
to talk to than Annette.

304
00:12:24,535 --> 00:12:26,537
-You talk to Annette?
-No.

305
00:12:27,663 --> 00:12:28,706
But Stan does.

306
00:12:29,457 --> 00:12:31,000
And as much as we try to infuriate him,

307
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:34,211
he won't get the hint.
What do I gotta do, hit him on the head?

308
00:12:35,004 --> 00:12:36,589
But, next thing you know,
he's back from the hospital.

309
00:12:36,672 --> 00:12:39,258
-So you actually did hit him?
-Yeah, just with a wine bottle,

310
00:12:39,341 --> 00:12:40,176
but it wasn't open.

311
00:12:40,342 --> 00:12:41,302
I guess I could do it again,

312
00:12:41,385 --> 00:12:43,929
but I just can't send him back
to the ER <i>again, </i>you know?

313
00:12:44,013 --> 00:12:45,055
Three times in one week.

314
00:12:45,222 --> 00:12:48,058
People are gonna start asking,
you know, elderly abuse?

315
00:12:48,142 --> 00:12:49,852
[sighs]
Which apparently is a real thing.

316
00:12:49,935 --> 00:12:51,604
I guess all old people
are this annoying.

317
00:12:51,937 --> 00:12:53,606
Well, so, I've looked into
selling the company

318
00:12:53,689 --> 00:12:55,524
to somebody else,
but the thing is that tech companies

319
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:57,902
don't normally sell
without a whole lot of vetting.

320
00:12:58,027 --> 00:12:59,445
And anyone I've talked to will only do it

321
00:12:59,528 --> 00:13:02,198
if the president stays on,
so before we find a clueless buyer,

322
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:03,866
we're gonna have to find
a clueless president.

323
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:06,368
And it's not gonna be me.
Someone that's stupid

324
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:08,412
and lazy enough
that he doesn't ask any questions

325
00:13:08,496 --> 00:13:09,955
-about the actual software.
-Oh, I love

326
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:11,457
how you're assuming it's a he.

327
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:12,958
[Gob] I know what you're thinking!

328
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:15,085
Look who's back.

329
00:13:15,169 --> 00:13:18,255
After your father
unceremoniously let me quit.

330
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:20,591
Now I'm back down
on the third floor without so much

331
00:13:20,674 --> 00:13:22,802
as a "feel free
to use the third floor" joke.

332
00:13:22,885 --> 00:13:25,304
[takes deep breath] Anyway...

333
00:13:25,387 --> 00:13:28,057
what are you two doing down here
after a long mid-weekend?

334
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:30,518
Well, Dad said we could use
the offices for Fakeblock.

335
00:13:30,726 --> 00:13:33,145
He actually said,
"Feel free to use the third floor."

336
00:13:33,354 --> 00:13:36,065
Mm. Now I'm glad I gave
one of those offices away.

337
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:38,943
-You gave an office away?
-Well, just one of the smaller ones.

338
00:13:39,026 --> 00:13:40,778
You won't even know
it's being used. [chuckles]

339
00:13:40,861 --> 00:13:43,489
{\an8}[Tobias] ...because an actor's body
is his instrument.

340
00:13:43,572 --> 00:13:45,366
Come get my shower ready
and then take over

341
00:13:45,449 --> 00:13:47,117
-on the elliptical.
-I'm on it. I got it.

342
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:49,161
No, you can't take another shower.

343
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:52,456
I'm still in socks,
and I'm about to serve food.

344
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:53,624
Well, what's for dinner?

345
00:13:53,707 --> 00:13:55,668
Turkey jerky, popcorn,

346
00:13:55,751 --> 00:13:59,380
-and leftover Jeff.
-Aw. There's no Linda left?

347
00:13:59,463 --> 00:14:00,881
You know, I don't want to jinx it,

348
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:03,551
but this certainly is better
than living in that attic, yes?

349
00:14:03,634 --> 00:14:05,052
-Oh, definitely.
-It's so great, Dad.

350
00:14:05,302 --> 00:14:06,929
And what's our number one rule?

351
00:14:07,012 --> 00:14:08,472
[both] Don't tell Michael.

352
00:14:08,556 --> 00:14:12,476
Well, yes, but I also meant, 88 more days,
and squatter's rights kick in.

353
00:14:12,726 --> 00:14:15,396

356
00:14:18,774 --> 00:14:23,070
This is going too fast now.
Murphybrown, this is going too fast.

357
00:14:23,153 --> 00:14:25,656
-All right, sorry.
-Switch it back. Oh!

358
00:14:25,739 --> 00:14:28,534
-[Tobias yelling]
-[DeBrie] Oh, God! Oh, God!

359
00:14:28,617 --> 00:14:31,871
Anyway, I'm just stopping by here
'cause this is where my e-mail comes.

360
00:14:31,954 --> 00:14:33,873
[Maeby] You could check
your e-mail anywhere.

361
00:14:33,956 --> 00:14:35,791
Uh, yeah, e-mail, but this is g-mail.

362
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:37,459
down here on the third floor
set it up for me,

363
00:14:37,751 --> 00:14:39,503
and then when we moved
to the fourth,

364
00:14:39,587 --> 00:14:41,839
I was like, screw it,
I'll just come down here to check it,

365
00:14:41,922 --> 00:14:43,757
'cause I don't want wires
going everywhere.

366
00:14:43,841 --> 00:14:45,175
You can use your phone for that.

367
00:14:45,259 --> 00:14:46,760
Yeah, and I could use a pigeon.

368
00:14:47,177 --> 00:14:50,472
But for this particular task,
I've chosen e-mail. [grunts]

369
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:53,475
Anyway, I sent my résumé out,

370
00:14:53,642 --> 00:14:56,061
and the only firm that's gotten back to me

371
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:57,897
is the gang over at Mailer Daemon.

372
00:14:58,063 --> 00:15:00,524
Aw, damn it! God, missed him again.

373
00:15:00,691 --> 00:15:02,276
It seems like they write me back

374
00:15:02,359 --> 00:15:04,153
every time I step away
from this thing.

375
00:15:04,445 --> 00:15:06,071
Well, on the other hand,
this is on them,

376
00:15:06,155 --> 00:15:09,992
'cause I made it clear that I was looking
for a three-day-a-week president job,

377
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:12,369
and why-- why...
[laughing, stammering]

378
00:15:12,453 --> 00:15:14,413
[breathy laughing]

379
00:15:14,496 --> 00:15:18,500
[exhaling repeatedly] Why-why... when...

380
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:20,961
when... what kind of... when... what...?

381
00:15:21,837 --> 00:15:24,006
You're looking for a president job?

382
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:27,009
[gasping, stammering]

383
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:30,304
-I'll be damned, it is a he.
-Who e-mails back...

384
00:15:30,387 --> 00:15:32,514
What? At Wednesday at nap?

385
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:33,849
[George Michael]
Hey, Gob, we want to beat

386
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:35,267
Mailer Daemon to the punch.

387
00:15:35,351 --> 00:15:37,603
Come to Fakeblock. Be <i>our </i>president.

388
00:15:37,686 --> 00:15:39,730
[George Michael] You won't need
to get your e-mail redelivered.

389
00:15:39,813 --> 00:15:41,732
Yeah. You already know the lay
of the office.

390
00:15:41,815 --> 00:15:43,692
You won't have to learn new snacks.

391
00:15:44,026 --> 00:15:45,444
[Maeby] And everybody knows you,

392
00:15:45,527 --> 00:15:47,321
so there won't be
gaining everyone's respect.

393
00:15:47,404 --> 00:15:49,114
And the best part is,
you get paid in stock.

394
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:51,492
Right. Money never has to change hands.

395
00:15:53,744 --> 00:15:54,912
I'm listening.

396
00:15:56,497 --> 00:15:58,374
-That's it. We're done talking.
-Mm-hmm.

397
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:00,626
Can I get back to you?

398
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,252
-Yeah.
-I'm in.

399
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:04,797
-Great!
-Well, looks like

400
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:07,049
I'm gonna need
that office space after all.

401
00:16:07,132 --> 00:16:10,636
This is not gonna be
an easy conversation.

402
00:16:10,719 --> 00:16:13,055
[Tobias, muffled] But mostly thankful
for the one man

403
00:16:13,138 --> 00:16:14,098
who made this all possible.

404
00:16:14,264 --> 00:16:17,434
Who took this ragtag,
talented troupe of a family

405
00:16:17,518 --> 00:16:19,269
and-- and put a roof
over their head,

406
00:16:19,728 --> 00:16:22,314
Jeff in their mouth,
and gave us the dignity

407
00:16:22,398 --> 00:16:25,109
to move as we will
after work hours.

408
00:16:25,192 --> 00:16:27,236
-To my brother-in-law Gob.
-[door opens]

409
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:28,362
Long may--

410
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:31,073
I need you guys out of here.

411
00:16:31,448 --> 00:16:32,741
And we're on the move again.

412
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:34,076
I don't want to go back
to living in that attic.

413
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:36,453
And the heat made me like,
"What's happening? Who are you?"

414
00:16:36,745 --> 00:16:38,414
-We'll figure something out, Murphybrown.
-Okay, I hate to be

415
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:40,416
the one to suggest it,
but I know about a tent city.

416
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:42,418
Well, there you go.
We're down a rung,

417
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:44,086
but we're down a rung together.

418
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:46,588
[Gob] Thanks, guys.
My first day as president,

419
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:48,424
and kicking people out makes it...

420
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:50,884
-makes it seem real.
-[Tobias] Oh, Gob. Something came for you.

421
00:16:51,301 --> 00:16:52,261
[Gob] Hmm.

422
00:16:54,263 --> 00:16:56,181
Powerful Gay Tastemakers?

423
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:57,683
[Tobias] The Gay Mafia.

424
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:00,269
-What?
-That's the Gay Mafia.

425
00:17:00,352 --> 00:17:01,770
Surely you've heard of them.

426
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:03,981
Very flattering. That's the real deal.

427
00:17:05,816 --> 00:17:08,152
[Gob] I wonder if this is from Tony.

428
00:17:08,444 --> 00:17:10,779
Maybe this is how
he's trying to reach out to me.

429
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:13,365
Wow. So I guess...

430
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:16,076
I guess sometimes
things do work out, after all.

431
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:19,288
-So we can stay?
-No.

432
00:17:19,747 --> 00:17:20,622
For me.

433
00:17:21,665 --> 00:17:23,333
Things work out for me.

434
00:17:23,417 --> 00:17:25,711
[Ron] <i>And while things</i>
<i>were working out for Gob,</i>

435
00:17:25,961 --> 00:17:28,672
<i>upstairs,</i>
<i>things were not working out so well</i>

436
00:17:28,756 --> 00:17:31,300
<i>-for Michael.</i>
-Remember, Mom doesn't want me

437
00:17:31,383 --> 00:17:33,510
to see the file, so I guess
this is what you'd call a...

438
00:17:33,677 --> 00:17:36,472
-Don't tell Gangee.
-You see the fun we have?

439
00:17:36,972 --> 00:17:39,141
I know you do.
Come on, the printer's in here.

440
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:41,935
So, it is a three-dimensional printer,
but I've just let it go all day.

441
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:45,606
What is this?

442
00:17:45,689 --> 00:17:47,149
Is this the printer
you sent the file to?

443
00:17:47,983 --> 00:17:50,027
Uh, yeah. Yeah, yeah. I think so.

444
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:52,237
The-- the file that was labeled
"Gated Community."

445
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:57,576
I think that this is

446
00:17:58,077 --> 00:18:01,038
a map that they did not want me to see.

447
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:04,958
It looks like a wall on the border, but...

448
00:18:05,667 --> 00:18:07,044
made out of teeth?

449
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:11,924
She's crazy. She's totally crazy.

450
00:18:12,132 --> 00:18:13,717
That might be a setting
in the printer.

451
00:18:13,801 --> 00:18:15,761
Let me see what we have here.
Yeah. See?

452
00:18:15,844 --> 00:18:17,930
Right here. You have to uncheck
"Presume Teeth."

453
00:18:18,013 --> 00:18:19,431
This is what they need me
to find money for.

454
00:18:19,515 --> 00:18:21,016
This is their secret project, huh?

455
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:23,560
Well, there's only one way
to find out for sure.

456
00:18:23,727 --> 00:18:24,937
Uncheck "Presume Teeth."

457
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:26,396
And print again.

458
00:18:27,189 --> 00:18:28,941
[Ron] <i>And as they went to do so,</i>

459
00:18:29,149 --> 00:18:31,318
<i>Gob went to meet with the Gay Mafia,</i>

460
00:18:31,819 --> 00:18:35,197
<i>hoping to run into</i>
<i>his old friend Tony Wonder.</i>

461
00:18:35,697 --> 00:18:37,866
Are there any tastemakers?

462
00:18:41,036 --> 00:18:42,121
Tastemakers?

463
00:18:42,204 --> 00:18:45,916
You sold a French Regency armoire,
and you don't think I'm gonna hear?

464
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:48,168
I want my taste. If not...

465
00:18:49,253 --> 00:18:50,420
Listen to this.

00:18:51,588 --> 00:18:52,714
[tapping]

467
00:18:59,221 --> 00:19:02,975
-Mmm.
-That was me tap-dancing on your grave,

468
00:19:03,058 --> 00:19:04,059
all right?

469
00:19:04,601 --> 00:19:06,186
Yeah, I think I'm in the wrong place.

470
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:08,480
-I was looking for a guy named Tony.
-No, Mr. Bluth.

471
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:11,441
You're exactly in the right place.
Take a seat.

472
00:19:11,525 --> 00:19:13,569
No, yeah, you know what? I-- I'm fine.

473
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:16,029
We wanted to congratulate you
on your coming out.

474
00:19:16,613 --> 00:19:18,490

-So brave.
-So brave.

476
00:19:20,617 --> 00:19:21,952
So brave. But you know what?
Thank you. It's...

477
00:19:22,035 --> 00:19:23,495
-The struggle is...
-Oh, shut up.

478
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:26,248
We know you're as straight
as an Oklahoma highway.

479
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:27,749
They're straight, right?

480
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:29,626
I wouldn't know.
I've never been in Oklahoma.

481
00:19:29,918 --> 00:19:31,211
You were in <i>Oklahoma!</i>

482

You're straight.

488
00:19:52,816 --> 00:19:54,943
No, no, no. I'm-- I'm gay.

489
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:57,154
Yeah, sure, because of your trick.

490
00:19:57,237 --> 00:20:01,658
[Ron] <i>Gob had recently performed</i>
<i>a sexuality switch illusion at a parade.</i>

491
00:20:01,742 --> 00:20:06,580
<i>It ended unexpectedly when his partner</i>
<i>had a premature emulsification.</i>

492
00:20:06,997 --> 00:20:09,499
<i>This left Gob</i>
<i>publicly out of the closet...</i>

493
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:11,335
Who's straight now?

494
00:20:11,418 --> 00:20:12,669
<i>...with no way back in</i>

495
00:20:13,253 --> 00:20:15,005
<i>and a sexual identity</i>

496
00:20:15,088 --> 00:20:17,674
<i>the magician's code precluded him</i>
<i>from undoing.</i>

497
00:20:17,758 --> 00:20:19,843
[man] Well, that son of a buck
gonna have to stay gay.

498
00:20:19,927 --> 00:20:21,970
[man] Unfortunately for you,
we also caught your appearance

499
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:23,889
on that religious program

500
00:20:23,972 --> 00:20:28,060
<i>And As It Is Such, So Also</i>
<i>As Such It Is-- </i>what is it?

501
00:20:28,143 --> 00:20:29,937
-"Unto you," boss.
-[man] <i>Unto You.</i>

502
00:20:30,312 --> 00:20:32,189
-Yes.
-[Ron] <i>Where Gob announced</i>

503
00:20:32,272 --> 00:20:35,192
<i>he was seeking Christian</i>
<i>sexuality conversion...</i>

504
00:20:35,275 --> 00:20:36,235
To Christianity!

505
00:20:36,318 --> 00:20:38,445
<i>...so he could find a plausible way...</i>

506
00:20:38,528 --> 00:20:41,156
To not being into guys, I guess.

507
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:44,201
You are talking
about praying away the gay.

508
00:20:44,284 --> 00:20:45,452
<i>...to lead a public life</i>

509
00:20:45,535 --> 00:20:47,079
<i>-as a straight man.</i>
-Well, yeah, I...

510
00:20:47,162 --> 00:20:48,789
Sure, I guess it could get me off.

511
00:20:48,872 --> 00:20:50,958
-I mean, out.
-[man] That sends a message

512
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:54,336
that conversion therapy works,
which will hurt us.

513
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:56,755
And we're the ones
doing the hurting.

514
00:20:57,965 --> 00:21:01,260
Oh, right, then there'd be less gays
that would suck the gays out.

515
00:21:01,343 --> 00:21:02,803
-[man] No.
-I mean, off.

516
00:21:02,886 --> 00:21:05,097
[man] Because it's a destructive sham
that thinks

517
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:08,183
that homosexuality can be cured
through shame and fear,

518
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,477
you pathetic little dipshit.

519
00:21:11,478 --> 00:21:12,688
You're right, I hear you.

520
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:15,941
And I'll cancel my appointment.
I'll lose my deposit, but right is right.

521
00:21:16,024 --> 00:21:18,735
It's too late for that. You said on TV

522
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:20,404
you're going into conversion therapy,

523
00:21:20,487 --> 00:21:21,947
so you are going to go.

524
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:24,408
And then you're going
to announce it didn't work.

525
00:21:25,742 --> 00:21:28,537
So... I have to stay gay?

526
00:21:28,829 --> 00:21:31,373
Just for seven years.
Then we'll let you age out.

527
00:21:31,873 --> 00:21:33,959
It's a lot more generous than what I did

528
00:21:34,042 --> 00:21:35,502
to that last guy
who faked being gay.

529
00:21:35,752 --> 00:21:37,754
You know him. Your pal Tony Wonder.

530
00:21:38,422 --> 00:21:40,924
Don't worry. We took care of him.
Didn't we, boys?

531
00:21:41,174 --> 00:21:42,801
-[man 2] We sure did.
-[man 3] We sure did.

532
00:21:42,884 --> 00:21:45,262
[man] Now, do as you're told,
and you will have made

533
00:21:45,345 --> 00:21:47,306
some very powerful friends.

534
00:21:48,015 --> 00:21:51,018
-In case you ever need a favor.
-[Gob] Austero.

535
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,812
Yes, I think I was shacking up
with your ex-wife.

536
00:21:54,521 --> 00:21:56,023
She was my sister.

537
00:21:56,189 --> 00:21:57,441
My apologies.

538
00:21:57,691 --> 00:21:59,901
Think I was shacking up with your sister.

539
00:22:00,277 --> 00:22:01,570
Maybe he is gay.

540
00:22:02,362 --> 00:22:03,780
[Gob] You know,
I hope you don't think...

541
00:22:03,864 --> 00:22:05,449
I mean, I...
Listen, I want you to know,

542
00:22:05,532 --> 00:22:07,701
my brother probably
didn't have anything to do

543
00:22:07,784 --> 00:22:10,245
with your sister's disappearance.

544
00:22:10,912 --> 00:22:12,039
I'm not worried about it.

545
00:22:12,539 --> 00:22:14,833
To be honest, we fought all the time,

546
00:22:14,916 --> 00:22:17,419
so it's probably better
for our relationship

547
00:22:17,502 --> 00:22:19,504
that she's no longer around.

548
00:22:21,048 --> 00:22:22,090
Tell me about it.

549
00:22:22,382 --> 00:22:24,760
My sister and I
don't get along, either. She just left...

550
00:22:26,094 --> 00:22:28,638
Now that you know
about our organization,

551
00:22:28,722 --> 00:22:31,141
we're going to ask
for a little insurance to make sure

552
00:22:31,224 --> 00:22:33,226
-you will always be loyal to us.
-[snaps fingers]

553
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,065
Since you're so good at magic,

554
00:22:38,148 --> 00:22:40,067
why don't you
make that disappear.

555
00:22:44,237 --> 00:22:45,572
Is that what I think it is?

556
00:22:45,655 --> 00:22:47,616
-Yes, it's what you think it is.
-Yeah.

557
00:22:47,699 --> 00:22:49,576
We got as much of the cement off
as we could.

558
00:22:49,659 --> 00:22:51,620
Don't need it traced back to us.

559
00:22:52,496 --> 00:22:53,622
You mention this to anyone,

560
00:22:53,705 --> 00:22:55,916
and this is the last sound
you're going to hear.

561
00:22:55,999 --> 00:23:00,087
-[tapping]
-You're gonna... tap-dance on <i>my </i>grave?

562
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:05,300
Oh, hell, you saw the matinee.
Out you go.

563
00:23:05,634 --> 00:23:07,803
Chop-chop. I want it off my floor

564
00:23:07,886 --> 00:23:09,346
and somewhere
no one will find it.

565
00:23:09,429 --> 00:23:10,889
I don't have all day.

566
00:23:10,972 --> 00:23:13,058
I've got to get out
of these work clothes.

567
00:23:13,141 --> 00:23:15,394
I have house seats
for Chita Rivera tonight.

568
00:23:15,477 --> 00:23:17,270
I don't know who he is.

569
00:23:19,564 --> 00:23:21,525
Stupid day to take an Uber.

570
00:23:21,775 --> 00:23:24,111
{\an8}[Ron] <i>On the next </i>Arrested Development.

571

<i>Tobias's family settles in at a tent city.</i>

572
00:23:27,906 --> 00:23:30,409
Looks like your old man
came through with that camping trip.

573
00:23:30,492 --> 00:23:32,244
Although we should stay together

574
00:23:32,327 --> 00:23:33,745
-just to be safe.
-[DeBrie] That's right.

575
00:23:33,829 --> 00:23:35,497
[whispering] We need to keep
a low profile.

576
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:37,707
Tent City is all about survival.

577
00:23:38,041 --> 00:23:40,919
[whispering] So I say
we just hunker down, okay?

578
00:23:41,002 --> 00:23:42,879
I bet this place
gets a lot quieter after dark.

[birds chirping]

580
00:23:44,673 --> 00:23:47,217
Also, we could always go
to the food court.

581
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:49,719
[DeBrie] Oh, and maybe we can ask
them to turn down the birds.
