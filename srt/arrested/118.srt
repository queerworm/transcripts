00:00:01,321 --> 00:00:02,762
[narrator] 
NOW THE STORY

2
00:00:02,762 --> 00:00:04,564
OF A WEALTHY FAMILY 
WHO LOST EVERYTHING...

3
00:00:04,564 --> 00:00:06,166
AND THE ONE SON 
WHO HAD NO CHOICE...

4
00:00:06,166 --> 00:00:07,887
BUT TO KEEP THEM ALL TOGETHER.

5
00:00:13,533 --> 00:00:15,535
IT'S ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT.

6
00:00:19,539 --> 00:00:22,142
- THE LOCAL COLLEGES 
ARE ON SPRING BREAK,

7
00:00:22,142 --> 00:00:24,384
AND THINGS ARE HEATING UP 
IN NEWPORT BEACH.

8
00:00:24,384 --> 00:00:26,066
[narrator] 
GEORGE MICHAEL WAS OFF

9
00:00:26,066 --> 00:00:27,627
FROM SCHOOL FOR TWO WEEKS...

10
00:00:27,627 --> 00:00:29,909
AND WAS ENJOYING SPENDING TIME 
WITH HIS UNCLE.

11
00:00:29,909 --> 00:00:32,552
- I'M INTERCEPTING 
SOME TELEPATHIC ENERGY...

12
00:00:32,552 --> 00:00:36,036
THAT'S TELLING ME 
IT'S THE EIGHT OF DIAMONDS.

13
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:38,878
- THAT'S AMAZINGLY CLOSE.

14
00:00:38,878 --> 00:00:41,441
- GEE, I GOT IT WRONG. WELL.

15
00:00:41,441 --> 00:00:44,043
I GUESS YOU WON 
THE SHIRT OFF MY BACK.

16
00:00:44,043 --> 00:00:47,687
- OKAY, THAT'S AMAZING. 
- IT'S THE QUEEN OF DIAMONDS.

17
00:00:47,687 --> 00:00:49,169
- NO, NO, NO.

18
00:00:49,169 --> 00:00:52,452
I HAD-- BUT IF THAT 
HAD BEEN THE ACTUAL CARD,

19
00:00:52,452 --> 00:00:54,814
I'M PRETTY SURE I'D BE 
ALMOST TOO BLOWN AWAY.

20
00:00:54,814 --> 00:00:56,416
- YOU KNOW, IT'S A NEW TRICK,

21
00:00:56,416 --> 00:00:58,258
SO I'M STILL KIND OF 
TWEAKING MY NIPPLES--

22
00:00:58,258 --> 00:01:00,380
- THE PRESENTATION WAS GREAT. 
- HEY. WHOA!

23
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:01,741
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE, HUH?

24
00:01:01,741 --> 00:01:03,423
GEORGE MICHAEL, YOU SHOULD 
GET TO SCHOOL.

25
00:01:03,423 --> 00:01:04,664
- NO, WE'RE OFF FOR TWO WEEKS.

26
00:01:04,664 --> 00:01:06,066
GOB'S TEACHING ME 
SOME NEW TRICKS.

27
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:07,467
- SPRING BREAK!

28
00:01:07,467 --> 00:01:09,629
[grunts] 
IT'S MY FAVORITE HOLIDAY.

29
00:01:09,629 --> 00:01:11,071
- NOTHING GETS ME MORE EXCITED.

30
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:12,312
- I CAN SEE THAT.

31
00:01:12,312 --> 00:01:14,033
YOU MIGHT WANNA 
BUTTON THAT SHIRT UP.

32
00:01:14,033 --> 00:01:16,556
- NO, I'M GOOD. 
ANYWAY, LISTEN, MICHAEL.

33
00:01:16,556 --> 00:01:18,558
I NEED THE YACHT.

34
00:01:18,558 --> 00:01:21,040
I KIND OF MADE A COMMITMENT.

35
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,442
[narrator] 
ONE YEAR EARLIER,

36
00:01:22,442 --> 00:01:23,643
GOB HAD APPEARED...

37
00:01:23,643 --> 00:01:25,485
ON A YOUTH-ORIENTED 
MUSIC NETWORK...

38
00:01:25,485 --> 00:01:27,967
WHEN THEY DID A SEGMENT ON 
"SPRING BREAK: NEWPORT BEACH."

39
00:01:27,967 --> 00:01:30,490
- NOW THAT I'VE GOTTEN 
YOUR ATTENTION,

40
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:33,052
I'D LIKE TO ANNOUNCE 
THAT ONE YEAR FROM TODAY,

41
00:01:33,052 --> 00:01:37,697
I SHALL MAKE THAT 
BEAUTIFUL YACHT DISAPPEAR.

42
00:01:37,697 --> 00:01:39,739
[crowd cheering]

43
00:01:39,739 --> 00:01:41,781
- WOW. 
HE'S AMAZING.

44
00:01:41,781 --> 00:01:43,423
- HE HASN'T DONE IT, AND YOU'RE

45
00:01:43,423 --> 00:01:45,265
HOLDING A FOUR OF SPADES 
IN YOUR HAND.

46
00:01:45,265 --> 00:01:47,587
- I DON'T CARE. 
I'M LOVING THE RIDE, YOU KNOW?

47
00:01:47,587 --> 00:01:50,710
- HOW ARE YOU GONNA DO IT? 
-WELL, YOU'VE GOT TWO WEEKS OFF.

48
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:53,072
YOU'RE ABOUT TO FIND OUT. 
[chuckling]

49
00:01:53,072 --> 00:01:56,356
MAYBE WE'LL MEET A COUPLE 
YOUNG COEDS ALONG THE WAY.

50
00:01:56,356 --> 00:02:00,680
HOW YOUNG IS TOO YOUNG FOR YOU? 
-THAT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN, OKAY?

51
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:02,162
THERE'S NOT GONNA BE 
ANY COEDS.

52
00:02:02,162 --> 00:02:04,204
THERE CERTAINLY ISN'T 
GONNA BE ANY MAGIC.

53
00:02:04,204 --> 00:02:06,886
IT IS A PATH TO A LONELY LIFE 
WHERE PEOPLE MOCK YOU.

54
00:02:06,886 --> 00:02:08,448
AND YOU DON'T 
EVEN REALIZE IT.

55
00:02:08,448 --> 00:02:09,809
- MICHAEL, I'M A MAGI--

56
00:02:09,809 --> 00:02:12,172
OH, I SEE WHAT YOU DID.

57
00:02:12,172 --> 00:02:13,853
- YOU'RE NOT DRESSED YET?

58
00:02:13,853 --> 00:02:16,015
I THOUGHT YOU WERE WORKING 
FOR ME TODAY AT THE OFFICE.

59
00:02:16,015 --> 00:02:18,458
- YOU GUYS STAY OPEN 
DURING SPRING BREAK?

60
00:02:18,458 --> 00:02:20,820
- WE'RE NOT ORTHODOX. 
BUT DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

61
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:23,903
KITTY'S COMING BACK, 
AND IT'S JUST IN TIME.

62
00:02:23,903 --> 00:02:25,905
ALTHOUGH SHE'S CAUSED 
NOTHING BUT PROBLEMS

63
00:02:25,905 --> 00:02:27,627
SINCE SHE'S WORKED FOR ME.

64
00:02:27,627 --> 00:02:29,749
[phone ringing] 
KITTY, ISN'T THAT YOUR PHONE?

65
00:02:29,749 --> 00:02:31,351
- NO, I'M ON THE PHONE 
WITH YOUR DAD.

66
00:02:31,351 --> 00:02:32,432
THAT ONE'S YOUR LINE.

67
00:02:32,432 --> 00:02:34,073
[ringing continues]

68
00:02:34,073 --> 00:02:36,596
- KITTY, THESE ARE NOT 
THE FILES I ASKED FOR.

69
00:02:36,596 --> 00:02:41,401
- OH, THEN I DON'T KNOW 
WHAT I SHREDDED.

70
00:02:41,401 --> 00:02:44,043
- HAVE YOU HAD A CHANCE 
TO TYPE UP THAT REPORT YET?

71
00:02:44,043 --> 00:02:45,885
- NO, I HAVE BEEN GOOGLING 
YOUR FATHER.

72
00:02:45,885 --> 00:02:47,767
- SO I'VE HEARD.

73
00:02:47,767 --> 00:02:50,890
- [chuckling]

74
00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:53,052
- SHE'S BEEN OUT FOR TWO WEEKS 
WITH THIS CHEST THING,

75
00:02:53,052 --> 00:02:54,814
BUT SHE'S HAD NO PROBLEMS 
CASHING THE CHECKS

76
00:02:54,814 --> 00:02:55,815
I'VE BEEN SENDING HER.

77
00:02:55,815 --> 00:02:56,976
- SPEAKING OF WHICH,

78
00:02:56,976 --> 00:02:58,458
HAVE WE GOTTEN ANYTHING 
FROM NANA?

79
00:02:58,458 --> 00:02:59,699
- BUSTER GOT A PERFORATED HEART

80
00:02:59,699 --> 00:03:01,261
AND GOB GOT 
THAT RECEDING HAIRLINE,

81
00:03:01,261 --> 00:03:03,223
BUT YOU AND I PRETTY MUCH 
DODGED THE BULLET.

82
00:03:03,223 --> 00:03:04,744
- NO, I MEANT IN THE MAIL.

83
00:03:04,744 --> 00:03:06,906
SHE USUALLY SENDS CHECKS 
FOR MAEBY'S BIRTHDAY.

84
00:03:06,906 --> 00:03:09,669
- THERE'S BEEN CASH COMING IN? 
HAVE YOU BEEN HOLDING OUT ON ME?

85
00:03:09,669 --> 00:03:12,272
- NO. NO, 
I'VE BEEN INVESTING IT.

86
00:03:12,272 --> 00:03:13,753
LET'S FACE IT.

87
00:03:13,753 --> 00:03:15,355
I'M BETTER WITH MONEY 
THAN YOU ARE.

88
00:03:15,355 --> 00:03:18,117
- BETTER AT SPENDING IT. 
- OKAY, I TELL YOU WHAT.

89
00:03:18,117 --> 00:03:19,519
I'LL TAKE YOU DOWN TO SEE NANA

90
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:21,441
IF YOU SPLIT THE MONEY 
WITH ME 60/40.

91
00:03:21,441 --> 00:03:23,403
- 55/55. 
- DEAL.

92
00:03:23,403 --> 00:03:26,446
- SOUNDS LIKE YOU GUYS ARE 
GETTING MORE THAN YOU THINK.

93
00:03:26,446 --> 00:03:28,768
- WE SHOULD GO NOW 
BEFORE YOUR DAD GETS BACK.

94
00:03:28,768 --> 00:03:30,250
NO NEED GOING HALFSIES 
WITH HIM TOO.

95
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:31,611
- RIGHT.

96
00:03:31,611 --> 00:03:33,212
[narrator] 
IN FACT,

97
00:03:33,212 --> 00:03:35,255
TOBIAS HAD GONE TO PRISON... 
TO RESEARCH THE ROLE

98
00:03:35,255 --> 00:03:37,497
OF FRIGHTENED INMATE \#2 
FOR A FILM.

99
00:03:37,497 --> 00:03:40,019
THIS CAME AT A BAD TIME 
FOR GEORGE SR.,

100
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:43,062
WHO WAS IN A CONFLICT WITH A 
PRISONER NAMED WHITE POWER BILL,

101
00:03:43,062 --> 00:03:46,426
A CONFLICT TOBIAS 
INADVERTENTLY HELPED HIM SOLVE.

102
00:03:46,426 --> 00:03:49,549
- I SOLD YOU FOR 
A PACK OF CIGARETTES.

103
00:03:49,549 --> 00:03:53,192
- BUT DIDN'T YOU COME HERE 
TO RESEARCH THE NATURE OF FEAR?

104
00:03:53,192 --> 00:03:55,475
I CAN'T THINK OF A BETTER 
TEACHER THAN WHITE POWER BILL.

105
00:03:55,475 --> 00:03:58,238
HE'S LIKE A MASTER'S COURSE 
UNTO HIMSELF.

106
00:03:58,238 --> 00:04:01,761
- SO YOU THINK I'M A COWARD?

107
00:04:01,761 --> 00:04:04,083
- THERE'S ONLY ONE MAN 
I'VE EVER CALLED "COWARD".

108
00:04:04,083 --> 00:04:06,085
THAT'S BRIAN DOYLE-MURRAY.

109
00:04:06,085 --> 00:04:09,048
NO.

110
00:04:09,048 --> 00:04:11,771
WHAT I'M CALLING YOU...

111
00:04:11,771 --> 00:04:14,053
IS A TELEVISION ACTOR.

112
00:04:14,053 --> 00:04:15,495
- OUCH.

113
00:04:15,495 --> 00:04:16,536
[narrator] 
AND SO TOBIAS

114
00:04:16,536 --> 00:04:18,258
REMAINED IN PRISON...

115
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:19,979
AS LINDSAY AND MAEBY 
ARRIVED AT NANA'S.

116
00:04:19,979 --> 00:04:21,301
[knocking]

117
00:04:21,301 --> 00:04:23,022
- REMEMBER, 
SHE'S A VERY OLD WOMAN.

118
00:04:23,022 --> 00:04:25,345
WE'RE GOING TO GET IN, 
GET THE CASH AND GET OUT.

119
00:04:27,347 --> 00:04:29,669
- IS THIS WHO I THINK IT IS?

120
00:04:29,669 --> 00:04:31,911
- [together] 
NANA!

121
00:04:31,911 --> 00:04:33,673
[narrator] 
UNFORTUNATELY,

122
00:04:33,673 --> 00:04:35,715
THE WOMAN WHO NOW LIVED THERE 
WAS NOT THEIR NANA.

123
00:04:35,715 --> 00:04:37,957
A FACT THAT TOOK LINDSAY 
AND MAEBY AN HOUR AND A HALF

124
00:04:37,957 --> 00:04:39,479
TO ASCERTAIN.

125
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:41,240
- GO! GO! IT'S NOT HER! 
DROP THE PHOTO ALBUM!

126
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:43,082
WE'RE NOT IN THE PHOTO ALBUM! 
- DROP THE PIE!

127
00:04:43,082 --> 00:04:45,084
- [panting]

128
00:04:45,084 --> 00:04:46,966
[narrator] 
AND MICHAEL ARRIVED

129
00:04:46,966 --> 00:04:48,288
AT WORK TO FIND KITTY.

130
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:50,089
- HEY, KITTY, 
HOW ARE YOU FEELING?

131
00:04:50,089 --> 00:04:51,691
- MUCH BETTER.

132
00:04:51,691 --> 00:04:54,654
MAN, I WAS REALLY 
STUFFED UP THERE!

133
00:04:54,654 --> 00:04:57,657
UP HERE, MICHAEL. 
UP HERE.

134
00:04:57,657 --> 00:04:59,258
- WHY'D YOU HAVE TO GET SICK 
NOW?

135
00:04:59,258 --> 00:05:01,301
WHAT WAS THE RUSH?

136
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:02,742
[narrator] 
IN FACT, IT WAS THE

137
00:05:02,742 --> 00:05:04,304
PREVIOUS YEAR'S SPRING BREAK..

138
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:06,185
THAT WAS RESPONSIBLE 
FOR KITTY'S RUSH...

139
00:05:06,185 --> 00:05:08,348
WHEN THE MAKERS 
OF THE POPULAR VIDEO SERIES,

140
00:05:08,348 --> 00:05:12,672
GIRLS WITH LOW SELF-ESTEEM, 
CHOSE NOT TO INCLUDE HER.

141
00:05:12,672 --> 00:05:15,435
- OKAY, WE GOT 
ALL THE GOOD STUFF HERE.

142
00:05:15,435 --> 00:05:17,397
- LET'S JUST SAY

143
00:05:17,397 --> 00:05:20,480
I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO 
A MORE SUCCESSFUL SPRING BREAK.

144
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:23,963
- "BREAK"? YOU WERE JUST OUT. 
- THAT WAS MY SICK LEAVE.

145
00:05:23,963 --> 00:05:25,284
THIS IS VACATION.

146
00:05:25,284 --> 00:05:27,006
- NO, YOU'RE NOT 
GOING ON VACATION.

147
00:05:27,006 --> 00:05:28,768
- OH, YES, I ABSOLUTELY AM!

148
00:05:28,768 --> 00:05:32,051
IF YOU NEED ME, 
I WILL BE AT SENOR TADPOLES,

149
00:05:32,051 --> 00:05:33,493
HAVING A MARGARITA 
MADE IN MY MOUTH.

150
00:05:33,493 --> 00:05:34,854
- NO, NO. HEY.

151
00:05:34,854 --> 00:05:36,736
KITTY, THERE WILL BE NO 
MARGARITA IN YOUR MOUTH.

152
00:05:36,736 --> 00:05:38,137
- OH, YES,

153
00:05:38,137 --> 00:05:40,099
THERE ABSOLUTELY WILL BE 
A MARGARITA IN MY MOUTH!

154
00:05:40,099 --> 00:05:42,021
SPRING BREAK! 
[whooping]

155
00:05:42,021 --> 00:05:43,503
UP HERE, MICHAEL. 
UP HERE.

156
00:05:43,503 --> 00:05:45,224
- PUT THE SHIRT BACK DOWN 
AND KEEP ON MOVING.

157
00:05:45,224 --> 00:05:47,266
YOU'RE FIRED.

158
00:05:47,266 --> 00:05:48,828
- I WORK FOR YOUR FATHER.

159
00:05:48,828 --> 00:05:50,670
YOU DON'T HAVE THE HIRING 
AND FIRING POWER.

160
00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:54,474
- I ABSOLUTELY DO, 
AND YOU'RE FIRED.

161
00:05:54,474 --> 00:05:58,878
- I DON'T THINK YOUR FATHER IS 
GONNA BE VERY HAPPY ABOUT THIS.

162
00:05:58,878 --> 00:06:01,481
BUT TAKE A GOOD LOOK, 
'CAUSE IT'S THE LAST TIME!

163
00:06:04,844 --> 00:06:06,846
- THAT'S THE SEVENTH NIPPLE 
I'VE SEEN TODAY.

164
00:06:06,846 --> 00:06:08,127
[narrator] 
AND MICHAEL

165
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:09,849
WAS CALLED TO THE PRISON.

166
00:06:09,849 --> 00:06:11,971
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING FIRING KIT? 
YOU CAN'T FIRE KITTY.

167
00:06:11,971 --> 00:06:14,093
FIRST OF ALL, YOU DON'T 
HAVE HIRING AND FIRING POWER.

168
00:06:14,093 --> 00:06:15,294
- I DO.

169
00:06:15,294 --> 00:06:16,536
AND I HAD TO. 
SHE'S CRAZY.

170
00:06:16,536 --> 00:06:18,097
- THAT'S WHY YOU DON'T FIRE HER.

171
00:06:18,097 --> 00:06:19,899
YOU DON'T FIRE CRAZY. 
YOU NEVER FIRE CRAZY.

172
00:06:19,899 --> 00:06:22,381
- DAD, SHE'S INCOMPETENT. 
SHE'S COMPLETELY UNPROFESSIONAL.

173
00:06:22,381 --> 00:06:26,986
LOOK, SHE JUST CAME BACK FROM 
SICK LEAVE, UH, WITH THESE--

174
00:06:26,986 --> 00:06:29,989
OH, MY GOD, YOU PAID 
FOR THOSE, DIDN'T YOU?

175
00:06:29,989 --> 00:06:31,511
- YOU GOT CARRIED AWAY.

176
00:06:31,511 --> 00:06:33,953
HELL, I'VE BEEN SO 
CORRUPTED BY MY POWER...

177
00:06:33,953 --> 00:06:36,436
THAT I EVEN ENJOYED 
FIRING MY OWN TWIN BROTHER.

178
00:06:36,436 --> 00:06:38,998
YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN HIS FACE 
WHEN HE WAS BEGGING ME NOT TO.

179
00:06:38,998 --> 00:06:41,000
WELL, HE'S MY TWIN BROTHER. 
I CAN SHOW YOU.

180
00:06:42,321 --> 00:06:45,565
[crying, mumbling]

181
00:06:45,565 --> 00:06:47,487
[laughing]

182
00:06:47,487 --> 00:06:49,529
IT WAS FUNNY. 
BUT, YOU KNOW,

183
00:06:49,529 --> 00:06:52,171
KITTY HAD ACCESS 
TO ALL KINDS OF INFORMATION.

184
00:06:52,171 --> 00:06:53,973
GOD KNOWS WHAT SHE POKED 
HER NOSE INTO.

185
00:06:53,973 --> 00:06:56,736
- THERE'S ENOUGH EVIDENCE 
ON THIS BOAT TO PUT ME AWAY.

186
00:06:56,736 --> 00:06:59,218
THE ONLY REAL THING 
I HAVE--

187
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:03,823
OH, GOD, THERE'S NOTHING 
TO HOLD ON TO DOWN THERE.

188
00:07:03,823 --> 00:07:05,905
YOU'RE LIKE A BOY. 
- WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?

189
00:07:05,905 --> 00:07:09,469
- ALL THESE BOOKS ARE COOKED!

190
00:07:09,469 --> 00:07:11,070
[sobbing]

191
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:12,832
- I'M SORRY. 
I GOTTA DO MY JOB.

192
00:07:12,832 --> 00:07:14,954
- AND I GOTTA GET OUT OF PRISON.

193
00:07:14,954 --> 00:07:16,395
NEXT TIME SOMEONE THREATENS ME,

194
00:07:16,395 --> 00:07:18,157
I MAY NOT HAVE 
A SON-IN-LAW TO OFFER.

195
00:07:18,157 --> 00:07:19,839
- I CAN'T COME IN HERE 
ALL THE T-- "OFFER"?

196
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:22,281
- I MAY NOT HAVE A SON-IN-LAW 
TO OFFER ME COUNSELING.

197
00:07:22,281 --> 00:07:24,123
YOU KNOW, HE SHOULD HAVE 
STAYED A SHRINK.

198
00:07:24,123 --> 00:07:25,925
HE'S VERY GIFTED, YOU KNOW.

199
00:07:25,925 --> 00:07:27,607
[narrator] 
IN FACT, TOBIAS HAD EVEN

200
00:07:27,607 --> 00:07:30,249
PRODUCED A VIDEOTAPE,

201
00:07:30,249 --> 00:07:33,132
BUT ITS BRIEF SUCCESS 
WAS DUE TO ITS MISLEADING NAME.

202
00:07:34,854 --> 00:07:36,415
ONCE THIS WAS DISCOVERED,

203
00:07:36,415 --> 00:07:38,337
ALL BUT 10 OF THE VIDEOS 
WERE RETURNED.

204
00:07:38,337 --> 00:07:41,701
- HIRE KITTY BACK, OKAY? 
FOR THE COMPANY. NO, NO.

205
00:07:43,743 --> 00:07:47,186
FOR ME, MICHAEL. 
[crying]

206
00:07:47,186 --> 00:07:50,349
- IT IS KIND OF A FUNNY FACE. 
- OH, COME ON, NOW.

207
00:07:56,035 --> 00:07:57,517
- THERE'S JUST ABSOLUTELY

208
00:07:57,517 --> 00:08:00,560
NO PURSE THAT WILL GO 
WITH THIS OUTFIT.

209
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,962
YOU'VE GOT A LITTLE POCKET 
THERE, ANNYONG.

210
00:08:02,962 --> 00:08:04,484
- ANNYONG.

211
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:06,526
- THAT'S NOT GETTING OLD. 
[door closes]

212
00:08:06,526 --> 00:08:07,807
- WHERE'S NANA?

213
00:08:07,807 --> 00:08:09,889
- I SENT HER 
ON A WONDERFUL CRUISE.

214
00:08:09,889 --> 00:08:12,011
YOU JUST MISSED 
A WONDERFUL CALL FROM HER.

215
00:08:12,011 --> 00:08:14,213
SHE JUST CAME BACK FROM 
A WONDERFUL COSTUME PARTY

216
00:08:14,213 --> 00:08:16,175
THAT THE CAPTAIN THREW.

217
00:08:16,175 --> 00:08:17,577
SHE GAINED 10 POUNDS--

218
00:08:17,577 --> 00:08:19,138
THERE'S SO MUCH FOOD 
ON THAT BOAT.

219
00:08:19,138 --> 00:08:20,980
SHE'S UP TO 74!

220
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:23,182
IT'S WONDERFUL, JUST WONDERFUL.

221
00:08:23,182 --> 00:08:25,344
[narrator] 
IN FACT, LUCILLE'S MOTHER

222
00:08:25,344 --> 00:08:27,466
HAD BEEN DEAD FOR SIX MONTHS.

223
00:08:27,466 --> 00:08:29,909
- SHE TRIED PESTO 
FOR THE FIRST TIME.

224
00:08:29,909 --> 00:08:32,271
CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT?

225
00:08:32,271 --> 00:08:35,474
NINETY-TWO YEARS OLD, 
AND SHE NEVER TRIED PESTO.

226
00:08:35,474 --> 00:08:37,356
[narrator] 
LUCILLE FEARED THAT THE FAMILY

227
00:08:37,356 --> 00:08:39,599
WOULD COME AFTER THE INHERITANCE 
IF THEY FOUND OUT.

228
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:41,601
- WAS SHE ON THE PHONE, ANNYONG?

229
00:08:43,963 --> 00:08:46,285
- ANNYONG.

230
00:08:46,285 --> 00:08:48,087
- [sighs] 
EMERY BOARD.

231
00:08:49,569 --> 00:08:53,132
ISN'T HE GREAT? 
AND HE GOES WITH EVERYTHING.

00:08:53,132 --> 00:08:55,454
[narrator] 
MEANWHILE, GOB WAS ADJUSTING

233
00:08:55,454 --> 00:08:57,496
TO A NEW COMPANION OF HIS OWN.

234
00:08:57,496 --> 00:08:58,818
- THAT'S NOT 
THE END OF THE TRICK.

235
00:08:58,818 --> 00:09:00,099
THERE'S A BIG SURPRISE COMING.

236
00:09:00,099 --> 00:09:01,901
- TAKE YOUR T-SHIRT OFF, PLEASE.

237
00:09:01,901 --> 00:09:03,462
- WHAT?

238
00:09:03,462 --> 00:09:05,545
OH, YOU CHANGED THE TRICK. 
IT'S A DIFFERENT TRICK.

239
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:09,869
- IF I ROLL UP THIS T-SHIRT, 
PUT IT IN THIS HAT--

240
00:09:09,869 --> 00:09:12,271
- GOB! HEY, GEORGE MICHAEL.

241
00:09:12,271 --> 00:09:14,313
- HANG ON. WE'RE IN 
THE MIDDLE OF SOMETHING.

242
00:09:14,313 --> 00:09:17,396
- IF YOU'LL BE SO KIND AS TO 
EXPOSE YOUR BREASTS, PLEASE.

243
00:09:17,396 --> 00:09:19,639
- NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO! HEY, 
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING?

244
00:09:19,639 --> 00:09:20,800
[people shouting]

245
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,441
- DAD, IT'S MISDIRECTION.

246
00:09:22,441 --> 00:09:24,644
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO KEEP YOUR EYE 
ON THE SHIRT IN THE HAT.

247
00:09:24,644 --> 00:09:27,046
- GET DOWNSTAIRS RIGHT NOW. 
COME ON.

248
00:09:27,046 --> 00:09:28,888
BUDDY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

249
00:09:28,888 --> 00:09:31,090
- I'M DYING TO SEE HOW HE 
MAKES THIS YACHT DISAPPEAR.

250
00:09:31,090 --> 00:09:32,892
- HE'S NOT GOING TO MAKE 
THE YACHT DISAPPEAR.

251
00:09:32,892 --> 00:09:33,933
I TOLD HIM THAT.

252
00:09:33,933 --> 00:09:35,454
- IT'S DRIVING ME CRAZY.

253
00:09:35,454 --> 00:09:37,336
IT'S LIKE A MIND PUZZLE, 
AN AWESOME MIND PUZZLE.

254
00:09:37,336 --> 00:09:38,858
[narrator] 
MICHAEL LOOKED AT HIS SON

255
00:09:38,858 --> 00:09:40,259
AND SAW...

256
00:09:40,259 --> 00:09:42,101
THAT HE TRULY WAS INSPIRED 
BY HIS UNCLE--

257
00:09:42,101 --> 00:09:44,343
THAT PERHAPS THE BOY 
ACTUALLY ADMIRED HIM.

258
00:09:44,343 --> 00:09:45,945
- I GOTTA GET YOU OUT OF HERE.

259
00:09:45,945 --> 00:09:47,827
YOU'RE GONNA COME 
WORK WITH ME AT THE OFFICE.

260
00:09:47,827 --> 00:09:49,468
GO WAIT IN THE STAIR CAR.

261
00:09:49,468 --> 00:09:51,350
HEY, I WANT YOU 
TO EXPLAIN SOMETHING TO ME.

262
00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:53,512
I'M OUT LOOKING FOR KITTY,

263
00:09:53,512 --> 00:09:54,834
AND I FIND MY SON IN THE MIDDLE

264
00:09:54,834 --> 00:09:56,355
OF A GIRLS WITH LOW 
SELF-ESTEEM VIDEO.

265
00:09:56,355 --> 00:09:57,797
- DON'T WORRY.

266
00:09:57,797 --> 00:09:59,318
HE'S GONNA 
BE COVERED WITH A BLUE DOT.

267
00:09:59,318 --> 00:10:00,399
HE APPROACHED ME.

268
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:01,841
AND AS FOR KITTY,

269
00:10:01,841 --> 00:10:03,362
I THINK YOU'RE CRAZY 
TO HAVE FIRED HER.

270
00:10:03,362 --> 00:10:05,124
WHO KNOWS WHAT KIND 
OF INFORMATION SHE HAS.

271
00:10:05,124 --> 00:10:06,565
HE'S MY BROTHER,

272
00:10:06,565 --> 00:10:08,047
AND HE'S NEVER 
EVEN SAID "GOOD JOB."

273
00:10:08,047 --> 00:10:09,568
I JUST WANT HIM TO LOVE ME, 
YOU KNOW?

274
00:10:09,568 --> 00:10:12,972
- WOW, YOU GET REALLY GIRLIE 
AFTER, HUH?

275
00:10:12,972 --> 00:10:14,814
- YEAH, SHE DEFINITELY KNOWS 
WAY TOO MUCH.

276
00:10:14,814 --> 00:10:16,535
WELL, GO GET HER. 
IT'S THE HOLIDAYS.

277
00:10:16,535 --> 00:10:18,177
I'M SURE SHE'S DOWN 
AT SENOR TADPOLES.

278
00:10:18,177 --> 00:10:19,538
- RIGHT.

279
00:10:19,538 --> 00:10:20,980
HAVING A COCKTAIL 
MADE IN HER MOUTH.

280
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:22,261
ALL RIGHT.

281
00:10:22,261 --> 00:10:23,743
I'M GONNA GO TAKE CARE OF THAT.

282
00:10:23,743 --> 00:10:25,384
IN THE MEANTIME, 
STAY AWAY FROM MY SON.

283
00:10:25,384 --> 00:10:27,426
- WOW, MICHAEL, 
I'M REALLY HURT.

284
00:10:27,426 --> 00:10:28,988
IT'S FAMILY.

285
00:10:28,988 --> 00:10:30,910
WHAT'S MORE IMPORTANT 
THAN FAMILY, MICHAEL?

286
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:33,112
THIS YACHT? 
- OF COURSE NOT, GOB.

287
00:10:33,112 --> 00:10:34,513
- YOU'D MAKE THE DEAL?

288
00:10:34,513 --> 00:10:36,395
BECAUSE I'D SIGN 
OFF ON THAT RIGHT NOW.

289
00:10:36,395 --> 00:10:38,798
I STAY AWAY FROM YOUR SON; 
YOU LET ME USE THE YACHT.

290
00:10:38,798 --> 00:10:41,120
- THE HOLIDAYS REALLY BRINGS OUT 
THE BEST IN YOU.

291
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,722
- WELL--

292
00:10:42,722 --> 00:10:44,403
[narrator] 
MEANWHILE, TOBIAS FOUND

293
00:10:44,403 --> 00:10:45,805
HIS EXPERIENCE AS A THERAPIST.

294
00:10:45,805 --> 00:10:47,566
WAS HELPING HIM DEAL 
WITH HIS NEW CELL MATE.

295
00:10:47,566 --> 00:10:49,408
- YES, BUT WHERE DOES 
THE HATE COME FROM, BILL?

296
00:10:49,408 --> 00:10:53,252
WHAT CAUSES IT? 
- THE JEWS, I GUESS.

297
00:10:53,252 --> 00:10:55,294
- SURE. BUT I THINK YOU NEED 
TO LOOK DEEPER.

298
00:10:55,294 --> 00:10:57,376
I THINK THESE ARE ISSUES 
OF SELF-ESTEEM.

299
00:10:57,376 --> 00:10:59,899
I KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE. 
I KNOW HOW IT FEELS...

300
00:10:59,899 --> 00:11:02,541
TO HAVE A FATHER, 
OR, IN MY CASE, A FATHER-IN-LAW,

301
00:11:02,541 --> 00:11:04,503
WHO DOESN'T RESPECT YOU.

302
00:11:04,503 --> 00:11:06,826
"ANYHOO," WE HAVE VERY 
LITTLE TIME...

303
00:11:06,826 --> 00:11:09,709
BEFORE THIS, UH, 4:00 POUNDING 
YOU PROMISED ME.

304
00:11:09,709 --> 00:11:11,951
I'M GONNA TAKE A SHOT 
AT SOMETHING AND SAY...

305
00:11:11,951 --> 00:11:15,795
THAT I THINK YOU HATE 
WHITE POWER BILL.

306
00:11:15,795 --> 00:11:19,598
- I HATE YOU! 
- YOU HATE WHITE POWER BILL.

307
00:11:19,598 --> 00:11:23,282
- I HATE THE GOVERNMENT! 
- YOU HATE WHITE POWER BILL.

308
00:11:23,282 --> 00:11:24,363

ALL PRISONERS, ONE HOUR.

[thud]

314
00:11:37,536 --> 00:11:39,418
- I GOT A PRISONER DOWN! 
PRISONER DOWN!

315
00:11:39,418 --> 00:11:41,821
- YOU KILLED HIM. 
- WELL, I--

316
00:11:41,821 --> 00:11:45,384
- LIKE DOROTHY. 
THE WICKED WITCH IS DEAD.

317
00:11:45,384 --> 00:11:49,068
ALL HAIL DOROTHY!

MICHAEL ASKED KITTY 
TO COME BACK.

320
00:11:53,592 --> 00:11:55,634
- WHO ARE YOU 
ASKING BACK, MICHAEL?

321
00:11:55,634 --> 00:11:58,197
ME? OR THESE?

322
00:11:58,197 --> 00:11:59,718
- I WANT YOU ALL BACK.

323
00:11:59,718 --> 00:12:02,201
I WANT THE WHOLE GANG. 
OKAY? PLEASE, KITTY?

324
00:12:02,201 --> 00:12:04,443
I'M TRYING 
REAL HARD HERE, YOU KNOW.

325
00:12:04,443 --> 00:12:06,926
CAN WE JUST MAKE BELIEVE 
THAT NONE OF THIS EVER HAPPENED

326
00:12:06,926 --> 00:12:08,367
AND JUST START FRESH?

327
00:12:08,367 --> 00:12:10,449
- MICHAEL, 
OF COURSE I'LL COME BACK.

328
00:12:10,449 --> 00:12:12,451
'CAUSE I NEVER REALLY LEFT,

329
00:12:12,451 --> 00:12:15,014
BECAUSE WE BOTH KNOW 
THAT YOU CAN'T FIRE PEOPLE.

330
00:12:15,014 --> 00:12:17,376
- NO, I DID FIRE YOU, 
AND NOW I'M HIRING YOU BACK.

331
00:12:17,376 --> 00:12:19,378
- YOU DON'T HAVE AUTHORITY 
OVER ME.

332
00:12:19,378 --> 00:12:20,699
THEY DON'T HAVE NACHOS HERE.

333
00:12:20,699 --> 00:12:22,541
- YOU KNOW WHAT? 
WHY DON'T WE FORGET IT?

334
00:12:22,541 --> 00:12:24,824
BECAUSE I'VE BEEN TRYING TO BE 
VERY, VERY GENEROUS TO YOU,

335
00:12:24,824 --> 00:12:27,867
AND YOU DON'T RESPECT ME, 
SO I'M FIRING YOU, OKAY?

336
00:12:27,867 --> 00:12:32,151
YOU ARE FIRED. 
- ALL RIGHT, MICHAEL.

337
00:12:32,151 --> 00:12:34,874
BUT I KNOW WHERE THINGS ARE 
AND YOU DON'T,

338
00:12:34,874 --> 00:12:38,918
AND YOU ARE ASKING 
FOR A WHOLE WORLD OF TROUBLE.

339
00:12:38,918 --> 00:12:41,200
- IF YOU'RE THREATENING ME, 
YOU'RE GONNA BE VERY SORRY.

340
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,842
- ARE YOU THREATENING ME?

341
00:12:42,842 --> 00:12:44,643
- YEAH, THAT'S A THREAT. 
I'M THREATENING YOU.

342
00:12:44,643 --> 00:12:47,686
- DID YOU HEAR THAT EVERYONE? 
MICHAEL BLUTH IS THREATENING ME!

343
00:12:47,686 --> 00:12:51,090
- I'VE GOTTA GET OUT OF HERE. 
I'M A PART OF THE STORY.

344
00:12:51,090 --> 00:12:54,293
I CAN'T BE A PART OF THE STORY. 
I CAN'T BE A PART OF THE STORY.

345
00:12:54,293 --> 00:12:58,017
- SAY GOOD-BYE 
TO YOUR COMPANY, MICHAEL.

346
00:12:58,017 --> 00:13:00,299
AND SAY GOOD-BYE TO THESE. 
- NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

347
00:13:00,299 --> 00:13:02,261
- 'CAUSE IT'S THE LAST TIME.

348
00:13:05,544 --> 00:13:07,867
- A WOMAN SHOWS ALL 
DURING A FRACAS...

349
00:13:07,867 --> 00:13:11,110
AT A LOCAL RESTAURANT, 
SOURCES SAY.

350
00:13:14,713 --> 00:13:16,395
[narrator] 
GEORGE MICHAEL

351
00:13:16,395 --> 00:13:18,517
WAS WORKING HARDER THAN EVER 
OVER HIS SPRING BREAK,

352
00:13:18,517 --> 00:13:21,320
FILLING IN FOR THE NOW 
TWICE-FIRED KITTY.

353
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:23,602
- LOOK AT US WORKING TOGETHER. 
YOU GET THE HANG OF THIS,

354
00:13:23,602 --> 00:13:25,124
AND THIS COULD BE YOUR SUMMER.

355
00:13:25,124 --> 00:13:26,645
- WELL I DON'T KNOW, DAD.

356
00:13:26,645 --> 00:13:28,567
I REALLY WANTED TO SEE 
GOB'S MAGIC SHOW AND--

357
00:13:28,567 --> 00:13:30,289
- NO, YOU DON'T.

358
00:13:30,289 --> 00:13:32,251
ISN'T THIS MUCH MORE FUN, 
WORKING WITH YOUR DAD?

359
00:13:32,251 --> 00:13:33,772
- IT'S JUST, 
THERE WAS SOME OTHER--

360
00:13:33,772 --> 00:13:35,054
- YOU GONNA GET THAT?

361
00:13:35,054 --> 00:13:36,375
[phone ringing]

362
00:13:36,375 --> 00:13:37,897
THANKS, LAURA.

363
00:13:37,897 --> 00:13:39,658
- GOOD AFTERNOON. 
BLUTH COMPANY.

364
00:13:39,658 --> 00:13:42,021
TALK YOU OFF? 
TALK YOU OFF WHAT, POP-POP?

365
00:13:43,502 --> 00:13:45,744
- GEORGE MICHAEL. 
I THOUGHT YOU WERE, UM--

366
00:13:45,744 --> 00:13:48,988
WHEN'S THAT VOICE GONNA DROP? 
WHERE'S KITTY?

367
00:13:48,988 --> 00:13:52,431
- I THINK DAD FIRED HER AGAIN. 
HE WANTS TO TALK TO YOU.

368
00:13:52,431 --> 00:13:54,033
- I DON'T WANNA TALK TO HIM.

369
00:13:54,033 --> 00:13:55,955
I MADE MY DECISION, 
AND THAT'S THAT.

370
00:13:55,955 --> 00:13:59,838
- OH, YOU HEARD? 
YEAH. ALL RIGHT.

371
00:14:03,242 --> 00:14:04,964
- WHAT DID HE SAY?

372
00:14:04,964 --> 00:14:07,046
- WELL, IF I CLEAN IT UP, 
IT'S NOT REALLY A SENTENCE.

373
00:14:07,046 --> 00:14:08,407
[narrator] 
AND SO, GEORGE SR.

374
00:14:08,407 --> 00:14:10,809
MADE ANOTHER CALL.

375
00:14:10,809 --> 00:14:12,491
- KITTY'S ON THE LOOSE.

376
00:14:12,491 --> 00:14:14,773
I NEED YOU TO MAKE 
SOMETHING DISAPPEAR FOR ME.

377
00:14:14,773 --> 00:14:17,056
JUST SOME BOOKS IN THAT COOLER 
MARKED "MADDAS."

378
00:14:17,056 --> 00:14:18,297
GREAT.

379
00:14:18,297 --> 00:14:20,219
[narrator] 
GEORGE SR. HUNG UP,

380
00:14:20,219 --> 00:14:22,902
CONFIDENT THAT HIS PROBLEMS 
WOULD FINALLY BE TAKEN CARE OF.

381
00:14:22,902 --> 00:14:24,944
- HEY, LITTLE JUSTICE.

382
00:14:24,944 --> 00:14:27,987
YOU, UH, PAINTED 
YOUR SHOES RED.

383
00:14:27,987 --> 00:14:31,390
- CALL ME THE TIN MAN. 
I'M A FRIEND OF DOROTHY'S NOW.

384
00:14:31,390 --> 00:14:33,112
AND SHE WANTS TO SEE YOU.

385
00:14:33,112 --> 00:14:35,194
[narrator] 
AND BACK AT THE OFFICE,

386
00:14:35,194 --> 00:14:36,755
LINDSAY ARRIVED

387
00:14:36,755 --> 00:14:38,757
WITH HER DAUGHTER 
AND HER MOUNTING SUSPICIONS.

388
00:14:38,757 --> 00:14:40,599
- MOM SAYS SHE 
SENT NANA ON A CRUISE.

389
00:14:40,599 --> 00:14:41,921
- YOU'RE STILL ON THIS?

390
00:14:41,921 --> 00:14:43,762
HOW MUCH WAS IN 
THOSE BIRTHDAY CARDS?

391
00:14:43,762 --> 00:14:45,364
- IT'S NOT ABOUT 
THE MONEY, MICHAEL.

392
00:14:45,364 --> 00:14:46,966
IT'S ABOUT NANA.

393
00:14:46,966 --> 00:14:48,607
I THINK MOM SENT HER 
TO A NURSING HOME--

394
00:14:48,607 --> 00:14:51,490
SOME GRAY, WINDOWLESS ROOM-- 
AGAINST HER WILL.

395
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:53,492
- SO WHAT WAS IT LIKE 
OUT THERE TODAY?

396
00:14:53,492 --> 00:14:55,054
- NICE. SUNNY.

397
00:14:55,054 --> 00:14:56,976
- WOW.

398
00:14:56,976 --> 00:14:59,578
- SO, HOW DO YOU THINK GOB'S 
GONNA MAKE THIS YACHT DISAPPEAR?

399
00:14:59,578 --> 00:15:02,261
- WELL, I'LL BE WORKING HERE, 
SO I GUESS I'LL NEVER KNOW.

400
00:15:02,261 --> 00:15:04,183
- THE ONLY REAL WAY TO FIND OUT 
HOW IT'S DONE...

401
00:15:04,183 --> 00:15:06,505
IS TO SNEAK ON THE BOAT 
WHILE HE DOES IT.

402
00:15:06,505 --> 00:15:08,027
- BUT IF HE MAKES IT DISAPPEAR,

403
00:15:08,027 --> 00:15:10,429
WON'T EVERYONE SEE ME 
STANDING THERE?

404
00:15:10,429 --> 00:15:12,471
- LET'S JUST SIT QUIETLY

405
00:15:12,471 --> 00:15:14,833
AND CONSIDER HOW RIDICULOUS 
THAT STATEMENT WAS.

406
00:15:16,395 --> 00:15:18,597
ANYWAYS, IF IT WAS ME, 
THAT'S WHAT I WOULD DO.

407
00:15:18,597 --> 00:15:20,599
- I WANNA CHECK OUT 
MOM'S FINANCIAL ACTIVITY.

408
00:15:20,599 --> 00:15:22,801
CALL HER BANKS, 
MAYBE RUN A HOSPITAL SEARCH.

409
00:15:22,801 --> 00:15:24,563
- IT'S GONNA MEAN 
A LOT OF HARD WORK,

410
00:15:24,563 --> 00:15:26,325
BUT I'LL PUT SOMEBODY ON IT.

411
00:15:26,325 --> 00:15:28,087
GEORGE MICHAEL.

412
00:15:28,087 --> 00:15:30,489
WHERE IS GEORGE MICHAEL?

413
00:15:30,489 --> 00:15:33,052
[narrator] 
IN FACT, AT MAEBY'S SUGGESTION,

414
00:15:33,052 --> 00:15:35,854
GEORGE MICHAEL WAS OFF TO VISIT 
HIS UNCLE GOB.

415
00:15:35,854 --> 00:15:37,937
- HI, UNCLE GOB. 
I CAME BY TO SEE...

416
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:40,139
IF YOU NEED ANY HELP 
WITH YOUR MAGIC SHOW.

417
00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:41,740
- GREAT.

418
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:43,862
- I THINK IT'S SO GREAT 
THAT YOU'RE DOING THIS.

419
00:15:43,862 --> 00:15:45,304
- I'M PREPPING RIGHT NOW.

420
00:15:45,304 --> 00:15:46,865
- HOW'D YOU GET 
MY DAD'S PERMISSION?

421
00:15:46,865 --> 00:15:48,467
[narrator] 
SUDDENLY, GOB REMEMBERED

422
00:15:48,467 --> 00:15:49,788
THE PROMISE HE HAD MADE...

423
00:15:49,788 --> 00:15:51,470
TO STAY AWAY 
FROM MICHAEL'S SON.

424
00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:53,552
- NONE OF YOUR DAMN BUSINESS. 
GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE.

425
00:15:53,552 --> 00:15:54,833
- WHAT?

426
00:15:54,833 --> 00:15:56,395
- YOU DON'T HAVE 
THE MAGIC IN YOU!

427
00:15:56,395 --> 00:15:58,757
YOU NEVER DID! 
YOU DON'T HAVE IT HERE!

428
00:15:58,757 --> 00:16:00,439
SO TAKE A GOOD LOOK.

429
00:16:00,439 --> 00:16:02,121
IT'S THE LAST TIME 
YOU'RE GONNA SEE THESE.

430
00:16:03,762 --> 00:16:05,884
[quietly] SORRY, KID, 
MORE THAN YOU'LL EVER--

431
00:16:05,884 --> 00:16:07,046
- WHAT?

432
00:16:07,046 --> 00:16:08,207
- BEAT IT!

433
00:16:08,207 --> 00:16:09,368
[narrator] 
AS GOB WAS FORCED

434
00:16:09,368 --> 00:16:11,370
TO SEND AWAY SOMEONE HE LOVED-

435
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:12,771
- [quietly] YOU'LL BE MISSED.

436
00:16:12,771 --> 00:16:14,173
[narrator] 
GEORGE SR. WAS FORCED

437
00:16:14,173 --> 00:16:15,854
TO VISIT...

438
00:16:15,854 --> 00:16:18,057
SOMEONE HE HAD ONCE TRIED 
TO SHOVE OUT OF A MOVING CAR.

439
00:16:19,298 --> 00:16:22,301
- WELCOME. 
- YOU'RE DOROTHY?

440
00:16:22,301 --> 00:16:25,344
- I THOUGHT THE TWO OF US 
COULD TALK, MAN-ON-MAN.

441
00:16:26,625 --> 00:16:29,748
I'M AFRAID I'M SERIOUS.

442
00:16:29,748 --> 00:16:31,710
I BOUGHT YOU.

443
00:16:33,592 --> 00:16:35,554
REMEMBER TO LET IT STEEP 
FOR FIVE MINUTES.

444
00:16:35,554 --> 00:16:36,996
- OH, DEAR GOD.

445
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:38,517
- I'VE BEEN IN THIS FAMILY 
FOR 16 YEARS,

446
00:16:38,517 --> 00:16:40,799
AND I DON'T THINK WE'VE 
EVER HAD A CONVERSATION.

447
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:43,242
- I'M NOT GONNA DISCUSS THIS. 
- YOU HATE ME.

448
00:16:43,242 --> 00:16:45,964
- YEAH, I DO HATE YOU. 
YOU TOOK MY DAUGHTER--

449
00:16:45,964 --> 00:16:48,607
MY PRECIOUS LITTLE GIRL-- 
AND MOVED HER AWAY,

450
00:16:48,607 --> 00:16:50,049
AND NOW I'M HERE,

451
00:16:50,049 --> 00:16:52,011
AND I AM AFRAID 
I WILL NEVER GET HER BACK.

452
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:54,693
- AFRAID. 
YOU'RE AFRAID.

453
00:16:54,693 --> 00:16:57,256
FEAR HAS TURNED INTO HATE.

454
00:16:57,256 --> 00:17:00,739
SO FRIGHTENED INMATE \#2 
ISN'T FRIGHTENED AT ALL.

455
00:17:00,739 --> 00:17:04,863
HE'S ANGRY. 
HE'S A CRABBY OLD COOT,

456
00:17:04,863 --> 00:17:06,945
AND HE NEEDS LOVE,

457
00:17:06,945 --> 00:17:09,268
JUST LIKE EVERYONE. 
[inmates go "aw"]

458
00:17:09,268 --> 00:17:11,350
- GET YOUR-- [beeps] 
HANDS OFF OF ME.

459
00:17:11,350 --> 00:17:14,313
- SHH. 
DON'T BE SCARED.

460
00:17:14,313 --> 00:17:18,517
[singing] 
SOMEWHERE OVER THE RAINBOW

461
00:17:18,517 --> 00:17:21,960
THERE'S ANOTHER RAINBOW

462
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:23,322
[narrator] 
AND ON THE BEACH,

463
00:17:23,322 --> 00:17:24,803
THE SHOW WAS BEGINNING.

464
00:17:24,803 --> 00:17:26,605
[crowd cheering]

465
00:17:26,605 --> 00:17:28,967
[Europe's 
The Final Countdown playing.]

466
00:17:30,849 --> 00:17:35,774
- ANY MAGICIAN CAN MAKE 
THE QUEEN OF DIAMONDS DISAPPEAR,

467
00:17:35,774 --> 00:17:39,338
BUT WHAT ABOUT A WHOLE BOAT?

468
00:17:39,338 --> 00:17:42,621
[cheering intensifies] 
[continues]

469
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:50,749
[singing] 
IT'S THE FINAL COUNTDOWN

470
00:17:55,274 --> 00:17:58,557
THE FINAL COUNTDOWN 
[cheering continues]

471
00:18:02,641 --> 00:18:06,165
- MOM, HAVE YOU SEEN 
GEORGE MICHAEL?

472
00:18:06,165 --> 00:18:08,767
- WE JUST GOT HERE. 
I COULDN'T FIND MY KEYS.

473
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:12,171
I CAN NEVER FIND 
ANYTHING IN HERE.

474
00:18:12,171 --> 00:18:16,735
- WHERE ONCE THERE WAS A YACHT, 
NOW THERE IS NAUGHT!

475
00:18:17,936 --> 00:18:21,220
[cheering continues]

476
00:18:28,187 --> 00:18:29,868
- ALL RIGHT. 
SO HOW'D YOU DO IT?

477
00:18:29,868 --> 00:18:32,671
- MICHAEL, A MAGICIAN 
NEVER REVEALS HIS--

478
00:18:32,671 --> 00:18:35,073
I SUNK IT! 
I SUNK THE YACHT!

479
00:18:35,073 --> 00:18:36,715
AT LEAST I THINK I SUNK IT.

480
00:18:36,715 --> 00:18:38,597
I MEAN, I BLEW IT UP, 
AND I DON'T SEE IT ANYWHERE.

481
00:18:38,597 --> 00:18:40,959
MY HEART WAS IN MY THROAT WHEN 
THAT CURTAIN CAME DOWN AND--

482
00:18:40,959 --> 00:18:42,161
[laughing]

483
00:18:42,161 --> 00:18:44,203
- YOU SANK THE YACHT? 
- SHH!

484
00:18:44,203 --> 00:18:45,684
- YOU SUNK A $700,000 YACHT?

485
00:18:45,684 --> 00:18:47,286
- $900,000 WORTH 
OF INSURANCE ON IT.

486
00:18:47,286 --> 00:18:50,929
AND GOT RID OF THE EVIDENCE. 
HOW ABOUT A "GOOD JOB"?

487
00:18:50,929 --> 00:18:52,651
[narrator] 
SEEING A WINDOW

488
00:18:52,651 --> 00:18:54,933
OF OPPORTUNITY, LUCILLE MADE 
A STARTLING ANNOUNCEMENT.

489
00:18:54,933 --> 00:18:57,095
- NANA WAS ON THAT YACHT! 
- WHAT?

490
00:18:57,095 --> 00:18:59,738
- YOU KILLED NANA. 
- SHE'S LYING!

491
00:18:59,738 --> 00:19:02,100
NANA WASN'T ON THAT YACHT. 
SHE'S FINE.

492
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:03,462
SHE'S BEEN DEAD FOR SIX MONTHS.

493
00:19:03,462 --> 00:19:04,463
[narrator] 
LINDSAY HAD

494
00:19:04,463 --> 00:19:05,584
LEARNED THIS INFORMATION--

495
00:19:05,584 --> 00:19:07,226
- FOR ABOUT SIX MONTHS.

496
00:19:07,226 --> 00:19:08,467
[narrator] 
WHEN SHE SPOKE TO

497
00:19:08,467 --> 00:19:09,868
THE FAMILY'S PERSONAL BANKER.

498
00:19:09,868 --> 00:19:11,550
LATER, FEARING THAT 
LINDSAY WAS ONTO HER,

499
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:12,911
LUCILLE WENT 
TO THE BANK HERSELF.

500
00:19:12,911 --> 00:19:14,673
- THERE MUST BE SOMEWHERE 
I CAN PUT THIS MONEY

501
00:19:14,673 --> 00:19:16,275
WHERE IT CAN'T BE TOUCHED.

502
00:19:16,275 --> 00:19:18,036
- I SUPPOSE YOU COULD KEEP IT 
IN YOUR PURSE.

503
00:19:18,036 --> 00:19:21,200
- VERY FUNNY, BUT I'M 
NOT CARRYING... A PURSE.

504
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,402
- WHERE'S THE MONEY, MOM? 
I WANT THE MONEY.

505
00:19:23,402 --> 00:19:25,003
- YOU CAN'T HAVE IT.

506
00:19:25,003 --> 00:19:27,206
IT'S IN A TRUST FUND 
FOR ANNYONG.

507
00:19:27,206 --> 00:19:28,927
- ANNYONG. 
- NO ONE CAN TOUCH IT BUT ME,

508
00:19:28,927 --> 00:19:31,770
AND I RETAIN CONTROL OF IT 
UNTIL HE'S 18.

509
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:33,452
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S MORE 
OFFENSIVE--

510
00:19:33,452 --> 00:19:35,053
THE FACT 
YOU DIDN'T TELL US...

511
00:19:35,053 --> 00:19:36,655
ABOUT OUR GRANDMOTHER'S DEATH

512
00:19:36,655 --> 00:19:38,337
OR THAT YOU SUNK 
A $700,000 YACHT!

513
00:19:38,337 --> 00:19:41,300
- STOP LECTURING ME. 
I JUST LOST MY MOTHER.

514
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:43,582
- I'M SO GLAD GEORGE MICHAEL 
WASN'T HERE TO SEE ANY OF THIS.

515
00:19:43,582 --> 00:19:46,144
MAEBY, WHERE IS 
GEORGE MICHAEL?

516
00:19:46,144 --> 00:19:48,066
- UM, WELL, IF HE'S NOT HERE,

517
00:19:48,066 --> 00:19:51,029
I'D JUST HAVE TO SAY 
HE'S PROBABLY ON THE YACHT.

518
00:19:51,029 --> 00:19:52,991
- ON THE YACHT?

519
00:19:52,991 --> 00:19:54,593
[narrator] 
IN FACT, GEORGE MICHAEL

520
00:19:54,593 --> 00:19:56,355
HAD BOARDED THE YACHT.

521
00:19:56,355 --> 00:19:59,278
BUT WHEN HE SAW THE EVIDENCE 
OF GOB'S LIFESTYLE,

522
00:19:59,278 --> 00:20:02,561
HE REALIZED THAT THIS PERHAPS 
WAS NOT THE LIFE HE WANTED.

523
00:20:02,561 --> 00:20:05,204
WHILE KITTY WENT IN SEARCH 
OF RETRIBUTION...

524
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:07,926
IN THE FORM OF THE FILES 
IN THE COOLER.

525
00:20:07,926 --> 00:20:11,250
- GEORGE MICHAEL'S A GOOD KID. 
I'M SURE HE'S AT THE OFFICE.

526
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:13,212
- RIGHT. I TOLD HIM 
TO STAY AWAY FROM YOU.

527
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:15,053
AND I TOLD YOU 
TO STAY AWAY FROM HIM!

528
00:20:15,053 --> 00:20:16,815
- I TRIED. 
I TOLD HIM TO GET OUT.

529
00:20:16,815 --> 00:20:17,976
- BLUTH COMPANY.

530
00:20:17,976 --> 00:20:19,498
GEORGE MICHAEL SPEAKING, 
NOT KITTY.

531
00:20:19,498 --> 00:20:20,859
- THANK GOD YOU'RE THERE.

532
00:20:20,859 --> 00:20:22,861
- I DON'T NEED 
A REAL SPRING BREAK.

533
00:20:22,861 --> 00:20:24,463
I REALLY THINK I AM 
MUCH BETTER OFF HERE

534
00:20:24,463 --> 00:20:26,265
ALONE IN THIS OFFICE.

535
00:20:26,265 --> 00:20:28,066
[narrator] 
MICHAEL REALIZED

536
00:20:28,066 --> 00:20:29,548
WHAT HE HAD DONE TO HIS SON,

537
00:20:29,548 --> 00:20:31,590
SO HE CAME UP WITH A SOLUTION.

538
00:20:31,590 --> 00:20:33,872
YOU'RE FIRED. 
- REALLY?

539
00:20:33,872 --> 00:20:36,275
CAN YOU FIRE PEOPLE?

540
00:20:36,275 --> 00:20:38,277
- YEAH. 
GO HAVE A SPRING BREAK.

541
00:20:38,277 --> 00:20:40,319
- THANKS, DAD.

542
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:42,681
ARE YOU SURE YOU'RE GONNA 
BE OKAY WITHOUT KITTY?

543
00:20:42,681 --> 00:20:45,284
- DON'T YOU WORRY. 
SHE'LL TURN UP.

544
00:20:52,491 --> 00:20:53,572
[narrator] 
ON THE NEXT

545
00:20:53,572 --> 00:20:55,334
ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT.

546
00:20:55,334 --> 00:20:58,417
LUPE MAKES 
A STARTLING DISCOVERY.

547
00:20:58,417 --> 00:21:02,381
- OH, SO THAT MAKES 
ANNYONG 18.

548
00:21:02,381 --> 00:21:03,902
[narrator] 
AND MICHAEL FINDS HIMSELF

549
00:21:03,902 --> 00:21:05,063
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SEARCH...

550
00:21:05,063 --> 00:21:06,585
FOR A MISSING KITTY.

551
00:21:06,585 --> 00:21:08,667
- WELL, WE HAVE A RESTAURANT 
FULL OF PEOPLE SAYING...

552
00:21:08,667 --> 00:21:09,908
THAT YOU THREATENED

553
00:21:09,908 --> 00:21:11,350
KITTY THE LAST TIME 
SHE WAS SEEN.

554
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:13,151
- HOW DOES ANYBODY 
EVEN REMEMBER THIS?

555
00:21:13,151 --> 00:21:16,595
- SHE SHOWED HER KNOBS 
IN A STEAKHOUSE, SIR.

556
00:21:16,595 --> 00:21:17,796
- SHE--
