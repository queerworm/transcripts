-Okay.

-Kill the iguana.
-I'm not an iguana.

17

Kill the iguana.

18
00:00:55,764 --> 00:00:57,640
-It's part of the process.
-Die, iguana.

19
00:00:57,724 --> 00:01:00,101
They're ready. They're ready!

{\an8}[man] Whoo! Yeah!

30
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:39,641
{\an8}Now, that was
the most invigorating session yet.

31
00:01:39,724 --> 00:01:42,060
{\an8}I feel good. You feel good?

32
00:01:42,936 --> 00:01:43,770
{\an8}I got you.

33
00:01:43,978 --> 00:01:47,065
{\an8}You know, guys, even I, Father B,
when I first started these sweat lodges,

34
00:01:47,148 --> 00:01:51,569
{\an8}I would come out of there thinking,
"Oh, God, I wish I had a lemonade,"

35
00:01:51,653 --> 00:01:56,533
{\an8}just like a child. You know, cold water,
some lemons, a little sugar, you know?

36
00:01:56,616 --> 00:01:58,910
{\an8}That's what I gave my power to.

37
00:01:59,452 --> 00:02:02,080
{\an8}Can we have the teaching pitcher, please,
Heartfire?

38
00:02:02,247 --> 00:02:06,084
{\an8}Hey, guys, this is Heartfire.
She is silent, but in that silence...

39
00:02:06,835 --> 00:02:07,877
{\an8}there is strength.

40
00:02:08,628 --> 00:02:10,713
She needs no words
to communicate to you.

41
00:02:11,339 --> 00:02:13,716
{\an8}[man] <i>Fraud.</i>

42
00:02:14,217 --> 00:02:16,052
Boundless power to you too,
Heartfire.

43
00:02:17,095 --> 00:02:21,099
{\an8}Hell, I was so weak, you guys,
I was willing to spend $10,000.

44
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:24,978
{\an8}Just a... little... sip...

45
00:02:25,645 --> 00:02:26,771
{\an8}of this lemonade.

46
00:02:26,855 --> 00:02:29,357
{\an8}But now I can spend two hours
in brutal heat

47
00:02:30,358 --> 00:02:32,402
with a cup of this cold,
refreshing lemonade

48
00:02:32,485 --> 00:02:33,862
-and just pour it in the dirt.
-No!

49
00:02:33,945 --> 00:02:37,073
Come on, Daniels!
You ran Bear Stearns, for God's sake!

50
00:02:37,365 --> 00:02:38,283
I was like this.

51
00:02:38,783 --> 00:02:39,617
Just like this.

52
00:02:40,201 --> 00:02:43,037
Then I went to the desert to seek answers
and now...

53
00:02:43,621 --> 00:02:45,206
I have them.

54
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:48,293
[narrator] <i>Actually, George Sr. had</i>
<i>purchased this part of the desert</i>

55
00:02:48,459 --> 00:02:50,628
{\an8}<i>as part of a scheme he shared</i>
<i>with his wife</i>

56
00:02:50,712 --> 00:02:52,589
<i>on the first day of her house arrest.</i>

57
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:54,674
{\an8}I can get this land for a song.

58
00:02:55,216 --> 00:02:56,593
{\an8}Are you listening to me?

59
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:58,761
So are those cameras, George.

60
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:02,473
{\an8}We can't use the same cameras
from when he was under house arrest?

61
00:03:02,557 --> 00:03:04,559
These are from the maritime penal system.

62
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:06,728
They make us use the waterproof ones.

63
00:03:07,395 --> 00:03:08,271
In here.

64
00:03:08,354 --> 00:03:11,774
[narrator] <i>And he laid out his plan</i>
<i>to sell the land to the government,</i>

65
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:13,943
<i>but Lucille had grander plans.</i>

66
00:03:14,402 --> 00:03:16,529
Sitwell's wall? How about our wall?

67
00:03:16,779 --> 00:03:17,906
We build the wall.

68
00:03:17,989 --> 00:03:20,158
We offer to build it for 150 million

69
00:03:20,241 --> 00:03:22,869
and we make up the difference
when we sell the land.

70
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:27,582
So that one's all set.
Can I put one up there?

71
00:03:27,665 --> 00:03:32,545
Only if you want to see the sexiest video
you've ever seen. Oh!

72
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:35,757
{\an8}Sorry I gave you the old noodle stab
in there...

73
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,635
[narrator] <i>And soon it was decided</i>
<i>that George Sr. should move out</i>

74
00:03:39,344 --> 00:03:41,804
<i>in order to make their fake divorce</i>
<i>look real.</i>

75
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:43,932
This fake divorce has gotta look real.

76
00:03:44,641 --> 00:03:46,684
After the trial you can move back in.

77
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:48,353
It's only a trial separation.

78
00:03:48,811 --> 00:03:52,440
You think you're going to be okay alone
with Buster?

79
00:03:52,523 --> 00:03:54,025
[narrator] <i>It was a reasonable question,</i>

80
00:03:54,108 --> 00:03:56,736
<i>as Buster had shown</i>
<i>a greater attachment to her</i>

81
00:03:56,819 --> 00:04:00,323
<i>than many expected during the few days</i>
<i>she had been away.</i>

82
00:04:00,406 --> 00:04:04,118
This is the same scene I came back to
after Cancun four years ago.

83
00:04:04,202 --> 00:04:06,788
[narrator] <i>But once she was back,</i>
<i>they had some nice moments.</i>

84
00:04:06,871 --> 00:04:08,039
[man on TV] <i>This hot mess...</i>

85
00:04:08,122 --> 00:04:10,583
[narrator] <i>Like when they simultaneously</i>
<i>stumbled on a term</i>

86
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:12,710
<i>they both secretly recognized...</i>

87
00:04:13,461 --> 00:04:14,504
"Hot mess."

88
00:04:14,629 --> 00:04:17,131
[narrator] <i>Would be useful</i>
<i>in their future disagreements.</i>

89
00:04:17,215 --> 00:04:18,299
[woman on TV] <i>Hot mess.</i>

90
00:04:19,217 --> 00:04:20,385
"Hot mess."

91
00:04:21,302 --> 00:04:23,596
If I need a moment to myself,
I'll step out on the balcony.

92
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,473
Your ankle bracelet's gonna go off.

93
00:04:25,556 --> 00:04:29,060
So I'll make him stand on the balcony.
He's happiest when he feels useful.

94
00:04:29,143 --> 00:04:31,771
That's why I'm making him my star witness.

95
00:04:31,854 --> 00:04:36,317
[narrator] <i>But soon it was getting harder</i>
<i>for Lucille not to alienate her alibi.</i>

96
00:04:37,443 --> 00:04:39,779
This toast has hook holes...

97
00:04:39,862 --> 00:04:40,822
again!

98
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:42,991
I told you to get rid of that thing,
it's hideous.

99
00:04:43,074 --> 00:04:45,618
Plus, what's going to happen
when they swear you in?

100
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:47,453
You're gonna rip the Bible in half.

101
00:04:47,537 --> 00:04:49,163
The jury'll love that.

102
00:04:50,248 --> 00:04:53,793
You're getting pretty snippy
to your key witness, aren't you?

103
00:04:54,544 --> 00:04:55,545
What do you want?

104
00:04:55,628 --> 00:04:58,715
Maybe you could hook me up
with a little stimmy.

105
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:02,343
A little stimmy.

106
00:05:02,677 --> 00:05:04,512
Are you trying to do this?

107
00:05:04,595 --> 00:05:07,890
Yes! And I want stimmy
to get a hook that'll do that.

108
00:05:08,599 --> 00:05:10,601
[narrator]
<i>When no such hook was available,</i>

109
00:05:10,768 --> 00:05:14,230
<i>Lucille found another way to mollify</i>
<i>her key witness.</i>

110
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:16,316
Your mother and I are getting a divorce.

111
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:20,028
[narrator] <i>But while Lucille and George</i>
<i>pretended to have fallen out of love...</i>

112
00:05:20,361 --> 00:05:23,197
-I'm getting married.
<i>-Gob was pretending the opposite.</i>

113
00:05:23,781 --> 00:05:26,117
<i>In fact, he was planning</i>
<i>on using his wedding</i>

114
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,536
<i>to do one of his famous magical illusions,</i>

115
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:33,791
<i>and all of it was to be televised</i>
<i>on one of those weird religious channels.</i>

116
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:36,502
<i>And although their plan</i>
<i>was dealt a minor setback</i>

117
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:40,214
<i>when Michael sold the controlling shares</i>
<i>to Lucille 2...</i>

118
00:05:40,298 --> 00:05:42,425
You know what? I am done with this family.

119
00:05:42,508 --> 00:05:43,718
I hope you've saved some money,

120
00:05:43,801 --> 00:05:45,470
'cause you're gonna need
every dime now.

121
00:05:45,553 --> 00:05:48,598
[narrator]  <i>All they had to do was keep</i>
<i>their plan a secret from her</i>

122
00:05:48,723 --> 00:05:50,266
<i>and cash in quickly.</i>

123
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:53,603
<i>4:28 in the morning here in the OC.</i>
<i>I'm John Beard.</i>

<i>The housing prices continue to plummet</i>

126
00:05:58,232 --> 00:06:00,318
<i>and the economists say</i>
<i>it may take quite some...</i>

127
00:06:00,526 --> 00:06:01,486
<i>What are you doing?</i>

128
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:05,031
<i>I'm John Beard, and I'm a Gloomy Gus.</i>

129
00:06:05,114 --> 00:06:06,240
<i>I don't have a mustache.</i>

130
00:06:06,324 --> 00:06:08,826
[narrator] <i>And the government</i>
<i>put the wall project on hold.</i>

131
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:09,952
It can't be on hold.

132
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:12,372
They already gave me the money
to start the building.

133
00:06:12,455 --> 00:06:13,331
No!

134
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:15,041
I cannot live off of that.

135
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:18,294
No, I already used that money
as the down payment

136
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:20,421
of six square miles of desert

137
00:06:20,505 --> 00:06:22,423
I cannot afford to make payments on!

138
00:06:24,092 --> 00:06:26,135
Oh, God. Sorry, Norman.

139
00:06:28,096 --> 00:06:29,013
What?

140
00:06:29,555 --> 00:06:32,141
-Nothing.
-Hey, brother. You seem tense.

141
00:06:32,266 --> 00:06:33,518
Come with me to the sweat lodge,

142
00:06:33,601 --> 00:06:35,853
sweat out this frustration.
You can learn on this.

143
00:06:35,937 --> 00:06:37,980
[narrator]
<i>And perhaps it was a sense of futility,</i>

144
00:06:38,356 --> 00:06:40,983
<i>or the fact he hadn't brought a book</i>
<i>to the desert,</i>

145
00:06:41,275 --> 00:06:45,154
<i>but George Sr. chose to enter</i>
<i>the small, smoke-filled room</i>

<i>while his wife was also confined</i>
<i>to a smoke-filled room,</i>

147

<i>strict no-smoking policy...</i>

148
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:55,581
[man on TV] <i>What is it about that lady?</i>

149
00:06:58,084 --> 00:07:00,795
[narrator]<i> And the fact</i>

<i>from approaching the balcony.</i>

151
00:07:02,797 --> 00:07:04,465
I went down to the club and I--

[man] <i>...slender and long,</i>

<i>Allure Slender Long smokes.</i>

158

<i>Lively, stylish and now.</i>

160
00:07:31,492 --> 00:07:34,412
Can’t really remember the host’s name,
but he was…

161
00:07:35,037 --> 00:07:36,372
he was kind of in his 60s.

162
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:39,333
<i>...designed to be modern,</i>
<i>extra slender,</i>

163
