00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:02,835
male narrator: NOW THE STORY 
OF A WEALTHY FAMILY

2
00:00:02,835 --> 00:00:04,004
WHO LOST EVERYTHING,

3
00:00:04,004 --> 00:00:06,172
AND THE ONE SON 
WHO HAD NO CHOICE

4
00:00:06,172 --> 00:00:08,841
BUT TO KEEP THEM ALL TOGETHER.

5
00:00:13,721 --> 00:00:16,724
IT'S ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT.

6
00:00:18,434 --> 00:00:20,395
MICHAEL BLUTH 
WAS TAKING HIS SON

7
00:00:20,395 --> 00:00:23,439
TO AN INTERVIEW AT 
THE PRESTIGIOUS MILFORD SCHOOL,

8
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:26,817
AN INSTITUTION 
ONCE FAMOUS FOR ITS CREDO

9
00:00:26,817 --> 00:00:29,570
THAT CHILDREN SHOULD BE 
"NEITHER SEEN NOR HEARD."

10
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:33,283
- "WOMAN."

11
00:00:33,283 --> 00:00:35,243
- [whispers] 
THEY'RE NOT GETTING IN.

12
00:00:35,243 --> 00:00:36,494
- BUT DAD, YOU KNOW, 
I MIGHT NOT GET IN EITHER,

13
00:00:36,494 --> 00:00:38,829
AND THAT WOULDN'T BE 
THE END OF THE WORLD.

14
00:00:38,829 --> 00:00:41,374
- SHH, WE'RE NOT EVEN GOING DOWN 
THAT ROAD, OKAY?

15
00:00:41,374 --> 00:00:43,334
THE NEXT FOUR YEARS 
ARE ALL ABOUT YOUR FUTURE,

16
00:00:43,334 --> 00:00:45,628
AND THAT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT 
THING TO ME, OKAY?

17
00:00:45,628 --> 00:00:47,588
- AND THINGS HAVE CHANGED 
AROUND HERE.

18
00:00:47,588 --> 00:00:49,840
WE HAVE TALKING SESSIONS 
THROUGHOUT THE DAY.

19
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:52,760
WE EVEN HAVE A TALKING ROOM 
WHERE STUDENTS ARE ENCOURAGED

20
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:55,221
TO GO IN AND TALK 
TO THEIR HEART'S CONTENT.

21
00:00:55,221 --> 00:00:58,224
- SOUNDS LIKE FUN. 
- FIRST THING HE'S SAID ALL DAY.

22
00:00:58,224 --> 00:01:00,435
- THE POINT IS, 
I'M NOT MY FATHER.

23
00:01:00,435 --> 00:01:03,229
I DO THINK IT'S BEST 
FOR THE MILFORD SCHOOL

24
00:01:03,229 --> 00:01:05,856
TO DISTANCE ITSELF 
FROM THE BLUTH NAME.

25
00:01:05,856 --> 00:01:07,817
IT'S NOTHING PERSONAL.

26
00:01:07,817 --> 00:01:10,320
- ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT THE FACT 
THAT MY FATHER IS IN JAIL?

27
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,239
BECAUSE I DON'T LIKE TO BE 
COMPARED TO MY FATHER EITHER.

28
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:14,490
- I DON'T MIND BEING 
COMPARED TO MY FATHER.

29
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:15,491
- SAVE IT FOR 
THE TALK ROOM, SON.

30
00:01:15,491 --> 00:01:16,576
- SORRY.

31
00:01:16,576 --> 00:01:20,871
- I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT 
MY FAMILY IS BACK ON TRACK,

32
00:01:20,871 --> 00:01:22,123
AND NO LONGER IN ANY TROUBLE.

33
00:01:22,123 --> 00:01:25,084
- NOT ACCORDING 
TO TODAY'S PAPER.

34
00:01:25,084 --> 00:01:26,919
- OH, GOD. 
WHAT HAVE WE DONE THIS TIME?

35
00:01:31,216 --> 00:01:34,177
- DON'T EVER MENTION KLIMPY'S 
TO ME AGAIN.

36
00:01:34,177 --> 00:01:35,178
- WHAT DID YOU DO?

37
00:01:35,178 --> 00:01:36,512
- IF I STILL HAD MONEY,

38
00:01:36,512 --> 00:01:38,973
I'D BUY A KLIMPY'S 
JUST TO BURN IT TO THE GROUND.

39
00:01:38,973 --> 00:01:40,183
- I KNOW, MOM. 
YOU HATE KLIMPY'S.

40
00:01:40,183 --> 00:01:42,101
TELL ME WHAT HAPPENED.

41
00:01:42,101 --> 00:01:43,478
- WELL, YOUR SISTER AND I TRIED 
TO GET INTO

42
00:01:43,478 --> 00:01:48,108
THAT NEW RESTAURANT, RUD, 
AND THEY WOULDN'T LET US IN.

43
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:49,900
- MRS. BLUTH, 
THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NO ROOM.

44
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:53,028
- COME ON. 
I'VE SUDDENLY LOST MY APPETITE.

45
00:01:53,028 --> 00:01:55,072
- OH, WHO'S GOING 
TO BELIEVE THAT?

46
00:01:55,072 --> 00:01:57,325
narrator: WITH HER BLOOD SUGAR 
AT A PERILOUS LOW,

47
00:01:57,325 --> 00:01:59,910
LUCILLE MADE LINDSAY PULL 
INTO THE NEAREST RESTAURANT.

48
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:02,955
- WELCOME TO KLIMPY'S! 
ANYWHERE YOU LIKE!

49
00:02:02,955 --> 00:02:06,459
- THIS DOES NOT BODE WELL.

50
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:09,129
I'LL HAVE THE IKE 
AND TINA TUNA.

51
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:10,838
- PLATE OR PLATTER?

52
00:02:10,838 --> 00:02:12,173
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND 
THE QUESTION,

53
00:02:12,173 --> 00:02:13,591
AND I WON'T RESPOND TO IT.

54
00:02:13,591 --> 00:02:17,345
- AND WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE? 
- I'D LIKE MY OLD LIFE BACK.

55
00:02:17,345 --> 00:02:20,515
- SO THERE REALLY WAS NO FIGHT?

56
00:02:20,515 --> 00:02:23,601
- WELL, ONE TINY THING 
AT THE END.

57
00:02:23,601 --> 00:02:24,852
- HOW CAN YOU TREAT ME THIS WAY?

58
00:02:24,852 --> 00:02:28,273
- OH, PLEASE! EVERYTHING 
I'VE SAID ABOUT YOU

59
00:02:28,273 --> 00:02:32,067
CAN BE COVERED WITH MAKEUP AND 
A LIE ABOUT A THYROID PROBLEM.

60
00:02:32,067 --> 00:02:33,319
GOOD GRIEF ALMIGHTY!

61
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:37,948
YOU THINK I'M ENJOYING 
MY SLIDE INTO POVERTY?

62
00:02:37,948 --> 00:02:42,828
SORRY, LINDSAY. 
THERE GOES YOUR DESSERT.

63
00:02:42,828 --> 00:02:44,914
- WHY DON'T YOU EAT IT, MOTHER?

64
00:02:44,914 --> 00:02:48,501
WHY DON'T YOU JUST TAKE 
THIS CAKE AND SHOVE IT [bleep].

65
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:51,128
HEY, WHO CALLED THE COPS?

66
00:02:51,128 --> 00:02:54,507
- IT WAS ALL JUST 
A BIG MISUNDERSTANDING.

67
00:02:54,507 --> 00:02:56,467
- TOTALLY BLOWN 
OUT OF PROPORTION.

68
00:02:56,467 --> 00:02:57,718
- WELL, LISTEN, 
JUST THAT YOU KNOW,

69
00:02:57,718 --> 00:02:59,345
I THINK IT COST GEORGE MICHAEL

70
00:02:59,345 --> 00:03:00,971
A CHANCE TO GO 
TO THE MILFORD SCHOOL.

71
00:03:00,971 --> 00:03:02,223
- OH, BIG DEAL.

72
00:03:02,223 --> 00:03:05,393
BUSTER'S THE ONLY ONE 
WHO EVER LIKED IT.

73
00:03:05,393 --> 00:03:08,896
narrator: BUSTER SO EXCELLED AT 
BEING NEITHER SEEN NOR HEARD

74
00:03:08,896 --> 00:03:10,523
THAT HE REMAINED 
AT THE SCHOOL UNDETECTED

75
00:03:10,523 --> 00:03:14,277
FOR A FULL TWO SEMESTERS AFTER 
HE WAS SUPPOSED TO GRADUATE.

76
00:03:14,277 --> 00:03:15,861
- NONETHELESS, MOTHER, I THINK 
THIS BAD PRESS IS STARTING

77
00:03:15,861 --> 00:03:16,904
TO TAINT MY SON'S FUTURE,

78
00:03:16,904 --> 00:03:18,906
AND WE'VE GOT TO 
PUT AN END TO IT.

79
00:03:18,906 --> 00:03:21,075
- MICHAEL, IF THIS IS A LECTURE 
ON HOW WE'RE ALL SUPPOSED

80
00:03:21,075 --> 00:03:22,201
TO WHATEVER 
AND BLAH, BLAH, BLAH,

81
00:03:22,201 --> 00:03:24,620
WELL, YOU CAN SAVE IT, 
'CAUSE WE ALL KNOW IT BY HEART.

82
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:25,746
- GOOD-BYE, MISSUS.

83
00:03:25,746 --> 00:03:27,081
- WELL, THEN, LINDSAY, 
YOU'LL BE HAPPY TO KNOW

84
00:03:27,081 --> 00:03:28,165
THAT I HAVE A NEW IDEA.

85
00:03:28,165 --> 00:03:31,669
I MET A PUBLICIST TODAY. 
I'M GONNA HIRE HER.

86
00:03:31,669 --> 00:03:33,713
WE NEED SOMEBODY 
TO MAKE US LOOK GOOD.

87
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:35,965
- AND I SAY 
IT'S A WASTE OF MONEY.

88
00:03:35,965 --> 00:03:39,093
WE'RE PLENTY SYMPATHETIC 
AS WE ARE.

89
00:03:39,093 --> 00:03:43,264
IS THIS YOUR ONION? 
- YES.

90
00:03:43,264 --> 00:03:44,515
- WHAT'S IN THE FOIL?

91
00:03:44,515 --> 00:03:46,476
- NOTHING. 
IT'S A BALL OF FOIL FOR MY SON.

92
00:03:46,476 --> 00:03:49,061
- HAVE A GREAT DAY, SWEETIE.

93
00:03:49,061 --> 00:03:51,897
- I DON'T KNOW HOW SHE CAN'T.

94
00:03:51,897 --> 00:03:54,984
- SO THIS PUBLICIST, MICHAEL, 
IS SHE CUTE?

95
00:03:54,984 --> 00:03:56,236
- I NEVER REALLY NOTICED.

96
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:58,070
narrator: IN FACT, MICHAEL 
HAD NOTICED HER AT THE GYM,

97
00:03:58,070 --> 00:04:01,031
BUT ONLY RECENTLY GOTTEN UP 
THE NERVE TO TALK TO HER,

98
00:04:01,031 --> 00:04:03,951
GIVING HIM A CHANCE TO WORK 
ON HIS FLIRTING SKILLS--

99
00:04:03,951 --> 00:04:05,661
- RACE YOU TO THE TOP 
OF THE HILL.

100
00:04:05,661 --> 00:04:07,872
narrator: WHICH HAD GOTTEN RUSTY 
OVER THE YEARS.

101
00:04:07,872 --> 00:04:10,541
- I'LL RACE YOU 
TO THE TOP OF THE HILL.

102
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:14,670
- I BROUGHT A PICNIC LUNCH.

103
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:16,547
- HEY, THAT HILL WAS REALLY-- 
- JESSIE BOWERS.

104
00:04:16,547 --> 00:04:18,841
IF YOU EVER HAVE 
ANY PUBLIC RELATIONS NEEDS.

105
00:04:18,841 --> 00:04:20,635
- MY RELATIONS ARE ALREADY 
A LITTLE TOO PUBLIC.

106
00:04:20,635 --> 00:04:21,636
I'M MICHAEL BLUTH.

107
00:04:21,636 --> 00:04:24,054
- FROM THE BLUTH COMPANY? 
- THAT'S RIGHT.

108
00:04:24,054 --> 00:04:27,267
- I'M GIVING YOU MY DIRECT LINE.

109
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:29,644
- OKAY, SURE. SHE'S-- 
SHE'S CUTE, I SUPPOSE.

110
00:04:29,644 --> 00:04:32,813
I MEAN, NOW THAT YOU'RE MAKING 
ME THINK ABOUT IT, SHE'S CUTE.

111
00:04:32,813 --> 00:04:36,359
SHE'S A CUTIE. 
SHE'S A LITTLE CUTIE PIE.

112
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:38,319
BUT I NEVER REALLY NOTICED.

113
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:39,570
- WHY DON'T YOU 
JUST ASK HER OUT?

114
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:40,780
- THAT'S NOT AN OPTION.

115
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:43,408
- 'CAUSE YOU'RE SCARED? 
- NO, BECAUSE OF GEORGE MICHAEL.

116
00:04:43,408 --> 00:04:45,451
HE STILL HASN'T GOTTEN OVER 
LOSING HIS MOTHER.

117
00:04:45,451 --> 00:04:46,786
I JUST WANT TO GET HIM 
THROUGH HIGH SCHOOL;

118
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:47,870
THEN WE'LL DEAL WITH ME, OKAY?

119
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:49,997
- SO YOU DIDN'T GET ANY WHILE 
YOU WERE IN HIGH SCHOOL,

120
00:04:49,997 --> 00:04:51,248
AND NOW YOU'RE NOT GONNA GET ANY

121
00:04:51,248 --> 00:04:53,793
WHILE GEORGE MICHAEL'S 
IN HIGH SCHOOL.

122
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:55,920
narrator: AND SO THE FAMILY 
GATHERED AT THE MODEL HOME,

123
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:58,589
EAGER TO HEAR 
THEIR NEW PUBLICIST'S PLAN.

124
00:04:58,589 --> 00:05:01,801
- GET JOBS AND BEHAVE? 
- INSTEAD OF US GETTING JOBS,

125
00:05:01,801 --> 00:05:04,178
WHY DON'T YOU DO YOUR JOB AND 
TELL EVERYONE WE'VE GOT JOBS?

126
00:05:04,178 --> 00:05:05,430
- YOU KNOW, I HAVE A JOB.

127
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:06,681
- [coughs] 
KISS ASS.

128
00:05:06,681 --> 00:05:09,224
WELL, WE WERE ALL THINKING IT.

129
00:05:09,224 --> 00:05:12,269
- I'M UNCLEAR ABOUT 
WHAT IT IS EXACTLY YOU DO.

130
00:05:12,269 --> 00:05:13,813
- EXCELLENT QUESTION. 
WHAT A PUBLICIST DOES--

131
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:15,940
- NO, NO. I WAS TALKING 
TO GEORGE MICHAEL.

132
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:18,275
WHEN DID YOU GET A JOB?

133
00:05:18,275 --> 00:05:20,820
- AT THE BANANA STAND. 
- OH! DUH.

134
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:23,280
I THOUGHT YOU MEANT LIKE 
A PLUMBER OR SOMETHING.

135
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,824
AND I WAS LIKE, 
"WHEN DID THAT HAPPEN?"

136
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:26,617
[laughs]

137
00:05:26,617 --> 00:05:28,994
- JESSIE, WHY DON'T YOU JUST 
GO AHEAD AND JUMP IN HERE.

138
00:05:28,994 --> 00:05:30,955
IT'S A TOUGH GROUP 
TO KEEP FOCUSED.

139
00:05:30,955 --> 00:05:32,790
- WELL, I'M GOING 
ON THE OFFENSIVE.

140
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:34,709
I WANT TO GET AN ARTICLE 
IN THE PAPER TO SHOW

141
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:36,335
THAT THIS IS 
A FUNCTIONAL FAMILY,

142
00:05:36,335 --> 00:05:37,753
AND THIS IS A RELATABLE FAMILY.

143
00:05:37,753 --> 00:05:40,756
- ARE WE ON? HELLO! 
HELLO FROM PRISON!

144
00:05:40,756 --> 00:05:43,759
THANKS TO JESSIE FOR SETTING UP 
THIS TELELINK.

145
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:45,094
I'VE STARTED 
A TORAH STUDY GROUP.

146
00:05:45,094 --> 00:05:46,762
I'M VERY EXCITED ABOUT IT.

147
00:05:46,762 --> 00:05:48,013
LOOKS LIKE--I DON'T KNOW--

148
00:05:48,013 --> 00:05:51,767
LOOKS LIKE I HAVE 
SOME POSSIBLE CONVERTS.

149
00:05:51,767 --> 00:05:55,396
- YOUR FATHER'S RELIGIOUS NOW? 
WE'LL PLAY THAT UP.

150
00:05:55,396 --> 00:05:56,647
- IT'S VERY SYMPATHETIC.

151
00:05:56,647 --> 00:05:58,273
- YEAH. 
WHO DOESN'T LOVE THE JEWS?

152
00:05:58,273 --> 00:06:01,527
- AND IT ALLOWS ME TO PUT 
MICHAEL FRONT AND CENTER.

153
00:06:01,527 --> 00:06:03,488
HE NEEDS TO BE 
THE NEW FACE OF THIS FAMILY.

154
00:06:03,488 --> 00:06:05,865
HE'S THE ONLY LIKABLE ONE 
IN THE BUNCH--NO OFFENSE.

155
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:09,577
- NONE TAKEN. 
- I'M SORRY.

156
00:06:09,577 --> 00:06:11,787
ISN'T MICHAEL THE LEAST 
LIKABLE ONE IN THE FAMILY?

157
00:06:11,787 --> 00:06:14,499
- NO, THERE ARE VERY FEW 
INTELLIGENT, ATTRACTIVE,

158
00:06:14,499 --> 00:06:16,417
AND STRAIGHT MEN 
IN THIS TOWN.

159
00:06:16,417 --> 00:06:19,462
- WELL, THAT CERTAINLY 
LEAVES ME OUT.

160
00:06:19,462 --> 00:06:21,672
SHE--SHE SAID SINGLE.

161
00:06:21,672 --> 00:06:26,594
YOU DID SAY "SINGLE," CORRECT? 
I THOUGHT I--

162
00:06:26,594 --> 00:06:28,554
- I DIDN'T QUITE HEAR THAT. 
THE RECEPTION IS BAD.

163
00:06:28,554 --> 00:06:30,598
BUT AS THE TALMUD TELLS US--

164
00:06:30,598 --> 00:06:33,267
[TV static]

165
00:06:33,267 --> 00:06:36,479
TO THE JACKAL 
AS TO AN OXEN.

166
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:38,898
[laughs] 
DID IT GET A LAUGH?

167
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:40,107
- I'M SORRY.

168
00:06:40,107 --> 00:06:41,859
I'M STILL ON THE WHOLE 
MICHAEL BEING LIKABLE THING.

169
00:06:41,859 --> 00:06:45,154
YOU KNOW THAT HE'S ONLY HAD SEX 
WITH, LIKE, FOUR WOMEN, RIGHT?

170
00:06:45,154 --> 00:06:47,197
- LET'S FOCUS 
ON YOUR LIKABILITY.

171
00:06:47,197 --> 00:06:49,784
YOU'RE GOING TO START DOING SOME 
CHARITY WORK WITH YOUR MAGIC.

172
00:06:49,784 --> 00:06:52,537
- ACTUALLY, I'M KIND OF THE 
CHARITABLE ONE OF THE FAMILY.

173
00:06:52,537 --> 00:06:53,871
- I THINK IT'S BEST 
IF YOU GOT A JOB.

174
00:06:53,871 --> 00:06:55,414
- OH, COME ON! 
I'M A PARENT.

175
00:06:55,414 --> 00:06:57,124
I CARE ABOUT 
MY DAUGHTER EVERY BIT AS MUCH

176
00:06:57,124 --> 00:06:58,668
AS MICHAEL CARES ABOUT HIS SON.

177
00:06:58,668 --> 00:07:02,087
- WHAT GRADE AM I IN? 
- WHAT KIND OF JOB?

178
00:07:02,087 --> 00:07:03,798
- SOMETHING WHERE 
YOU'LL BE SEEN.

179
00:07:03,798 --> 00:07:05,841
I REPRESENT CLOUDMIR VODKA,

180
00:07:05,841 --> 00:07:09,136
AND THEY WANT SOMEONE TO PROMOTE 
IT BY ORDERING IT AT A HOT BAR.

181
00:07:09,136 --> 00:07:12,515
A PLACE LIKE RUD. 
- OKAY. I'LL DO IT.

182
00:07:12,515 --> 00:07:14,559
- AND TOBIAS, 
YOU'RE A MEDICAL DOCTOR,

183
00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:17,311
AND YOU'RE LIVING 
AN ABSURD FANTASY AS AN ACTOR.

184
00:07:17,311 --> 00:07:20,565
IT'S TIME TO GET REAL. 
- WOW.

185
00:07:20,565 --> 00:07:23,108
IT'S TOUGH TALK, 
BUT I LIKE IT.

186
00:07:23,108 --> 00:07:25,486
YOU'RE SAYING 
LAND A MAJOR FILM.

187
00:07:25,486 --> 00:07:27,237
- I'M SAYING GET 
YOUR MEDICAL LICENSE BACK.

188
00:07:27,237 --> 00:07:30,032
I'VE SET UP A HEARING 
FOR TOMORROW IN BOSTON.

189
00:07:30,032 --> 00:07:32,201
MICHAEL HAS GENEROUSLY DONATED 
$1,100 FOR YOUR TRIP.

190
00:07:32,201 --> 00:07:34,286
- I'M SORRY.

191
00:07:34,286 --> 00:07:35,913
I TRULY BELIEVE THAT 
THE UNIVERSE WANTS ME

192
00:07:35,913 --> 00:07:37,832
TO BE AN ACTOR 
AND NOT A DOCTOR.

193
00:07:37,832 --> 00:07:39,083
I'M JUST WAITING 
FOR A SIGN.

194
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:40,960
- HERE'S YOUR CASH.

195
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,545
UNIVERSAL SHUTTLE 
PICKS YOU UP AT 8:00.

196
00:07:42,545 --> 00:07:44,964
- ANY SIGN, REALLY.

197
00:07:44,964 --> 00:07:48,634
- SORRY, SOME OF MY STUDENTS ARE 
ARGUING THE SIGNIFICANCE

198
00:07:48,634 --> 00:07:51,178
OF THE SHANK BONE 
ON THE SEDER PLATE.

199
00:07:51,178 --> 00:07:52,429
BUT THAT--NOT...

200
00:07:52,429 --> 00:07:56,601
DO NOT WAG OUR GENITALS 
AT ONE ANOTHER TO MAKE A POINT.

201
00:07:56,601 --> 00:07:58,603
- THOUGHT-PROVOKING.

202
00:07:58,603 --> 00:08:02,732
- AND LUCILLE, 
PEOPLE THINK YOU'RE COLD.

203
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:04,066
- HANUKKAH CAN BE SPELLED 
SO MANY WAYS. OH, GOD!

204
00:08:04,066 --> 00:08:05,234
[all yelling]

205
00:08:05,234 --> 00:08:10,072
beep!

206
00:08:10,072 --> 00:08:13,367
- BUSTER. 
- RIGHT HERE. READY TO GO.

207
00:08:13,367 --> 00:08:15,495
AT YOUR SERVICE. 
GET ME OUT THERE.

208
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:17,538
- I WANT YOU TO STAY IN.

209
00:08:17,538 --> 00:08:19,999
PEOPLE FIND YOU 
ODD AND ALIENATING.

210
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:22,710
YOU MAKE THEM UNEASY. 
STAY OUT OF THE SPOTLIGHT.

211
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:27,840
- I SHALL BE NEITHER SEEN 
NOR HEARD. WATCH ME.

212
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,259
- YOU CAN ALWAYS TELL 
A MILFORD MAN.

EACH WITH THEIR NEW CHARGE,

214
00:08:40,144 --> 00:08:42,855
THE BLUTHS SET ABOUT 
REDEFINING THEIR IMAGE.

215
00:08:42,855 --> 00:08:45,816
TOBIAS WAS OFF TO LOS ANGELES 
INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT,

216
00:08:45,816 --> 00:08:48,360
DETERMINED TO RETURN 
TO HIS FAMILY WITH A CAREER.

217
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:50,404
- WELL, THIS IS GREAT.

218
00:08:50,404 --> 00:08:53,073
WHY WOULD ANYBODY TAKE A LIMO?

219
00:08:53,073 --> 00:08:55,535
WHAT IS THIS, LIKE, $12?

220
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:59,914
WHY WOULD ANYBODY PAY MORE 
THAN $12 TO GO TO THE AIRPORT?

221
00:08:59,914 --> 00:09:02,207
NEXT STOP, LAX.

222
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:03,458
OH, COME ON! 
WE'RE STOPPING AGAIN?

223
00:09:03,458 --> 00:09:05,377
HOW MANY MORE STOPS 
ARE WE GONNA MAKE?

224
00:09:05,377 --> 00:09:07,379
HONESTLY, I HAVEN'T EVEN SEEN 
THIS PART OF LOS ANG--

225
00:09:07,379 --> 00:09:10,257
IS THAT SNOW?

226
00:09:10,257 --> 00:09:12,217
REALLY, NOW. 
THIS IS RIDICULOUS.

227
00:09:12,217 --> 00:09:16,013
I PAID 12 AMERICAN-- 
OH, MY GOD.

228
00:09:16,013 --> 00:09:20,267
YOU ARE CARL WEATHERS, 
THE ACTOR.

229
00:09:20,267 --> 00:09:21,518
I WENT TO SAN FRANCISCO 
TO ATTEND

230
00:09:21,518 --> 00:09:23,353
YOUR STAGE FIGHTING WORKSHOP.

231
00:09:23,353 --> 00:09:27,650
BUT YOU NEVER SHOWED UP. 
- I GOT BUMPED FROM THAT FLIGHT.

232
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:29,610
HELL, THEY'LL GIVE YOU $300 
IF YOU GET BUMPED.

233
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:31,070
IT'S THIS CRAZY LOOPHOLE 
IN THE SYSTEM

234
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:34,489
THAT THE WRONG GUY DISCOVERED.

235
00:09:34,489 --> 00:09:38,493
GUESS WHERE I WON'T BE GOING. 
[laughs]

236
00:09:38,493 --> 00:09:42,206
- YEAH. SO... 
[chuckles]

237
00:09:42,206 --> 00:09:44,750
I AM AN ACTOR TOO.

238
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,961
- OH. GOOD. 
- WELL, I WANT TO BE.

239
00:09:46,961 --> 00:09:48,212
I MEAN, 
WITHOUT THE PROPER TRAINING,

240
00:09:48,212 --> 00:09:51,340
I'M AFRAID I'M DOOMED 
TO BE A DOCTOR.

241
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:53,843
- WELL, HELL, 
I CAN TRAIN YOU.

242
00:09:53,843 --> 00:09:56,470
- OH, WELL, I'M AFRAID 
ALL I HAVE IS $1,100,

243
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:59,139
AND THAT'S FOR 
THIS PLANE TICKET, SO...

244
00:09:59,139 --> 00:10:00,390
- CHECK THIS OUT.

245
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:04,311
$1,100 IS EXACTLY WHAT I CHARGE 
FOR ACTING CLASSES.

246
00:10:04,311 --> 00:10:06,230
- NO, IT ISN'T! 
- YEAH.

247
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:08,608
- WELL, WHAT ARE THE CHANCE-- 
[chuckles]

248
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:11,736

YOU'VE DONE IT AGAIN.

BEGINNING HIS CHARITY WORK

AT A LOCAL NURSING HOME.

251
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:17,992
- I'M GONNA NEED A VOLUNTEER 
FOR MY NEXT ILLUSION,

252
00:10:17,992 --> 00:10:20,369
THE AZTEC TOMB!

253
00:10:20,369 --> 00:10:23,998
- A TOMB? 
- OR BOX. BOX IS... FINE.

254
00:10:23,998 --> 00:10:27,877
OH, YES! WELL, EXCELLENT. 
LET'S GET YOU IN THE BOX.

255
00:10:27,877 --> 00:10:29,419
[softly] 
THERE'S A PANEL.

256
00:10:29,419 --> 00:10:30,880
JUST FLIP IT AROUND, 
CURL UP BEHIND IT,

257
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:36,218
DON'T MAKE ANY NOISE, 
ALL RIGHT?

258
00:10:36,218 --> 00:10:40,055
ANCIENT LORE HAS IT 
THE AZTEC GODS PUT A CURSE

259
00:10:40,055 --> 00:10:43,809
ON ANY MAN WHO DARE-- 
- WHAT?

260
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:45,394

AND MICHAEL, AT JESSIE'S 
INSISTENCE, WAS OUT ON THE TOWN.

IN SO LONG,

265
00:10:57,823 --> 00:10:58,991
I FEEL A LITTLE GUILTY.

266
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:01,451
- YOU HAVE NOTHING 
TO BE GUILTY ABOUT.

267
00:11:01,451 --> 00:11:02,787
YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE 
IN YOUR FAMILY

268
00:11:02,787 --> 00:11:04,246
WHO'S EVER BEEN RESPONSIBLE.

269
00:11:04,246 --> 00:11:06,666
- WELL, I'M CERTAINLY THE ONLY 
ONE THAT'S EVER HELD A REAL JOB.

270
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:09,710
- OH, REALLY, MICHAEL? 
WATCH THIS.

271
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:12,296
WOW! THIS CLOUDMIR'S 
MAKING ME THINK FUZZY.

272
00:11:12,296 --> 00:11:15,049
I HAVE ALMOST 
NO JUDGMENT AT ALL.

273
00:11:15,049 --> 00:11:16,675

WITH A REAL JOB."

275

BEEN DOING

276
00:11:21,596 --> 00:11:22,807
A GREAT JOB WITH MY FAMILY.

277
00:11:22,807 --> 00:11:24,809
- OH, GOOD. GET ONE 
OF MICHAEL AND ME ON A DATE.

278
00:11:24,809 --> 00:11:27,311
- SURE.

279
00:11:27,311 --> 00:11:29,313
- THANK YOU. 
- YOU'RE WELCOME, SIR.

280
00:11:29,313 --> 00:11:30,564
- A DATE? 
THIS IS A DATE NOW?

281
00:11:30,564 --> 00:11:32,607
I THOUGHT THIS WAS 
JUST BUSINESS.

282
00:11:32,607 --> 00:11:35,569
- CAN'T IT BE 
A LITTLE BIT OF BOTH?

283
00:11:35,569 --> 00:11:37,696
- HOW WILL I KNOW 
WHICH PART OF IT IS BUSINESS?

284
00:11:37,696 --> 00:11:42,326
UH-OH.

285
00:11:42,326 --> 00:11:44,954
CAN'T WAIT TO SEE WHICH PART 
OF IT IS A DATE.

286
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:53,212
SHOW ME BUSINESS AGAIN.

289
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:57,967
- JUST TRYING TO GET 
THE TV WORKING.

290
00:11:57,967 --> 00:11:59,218
- OH, YEAH, 
I TRIED THAT EARLIER.

291
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:00,761
I THINK IT'S STILL HOOKED UP 
TO THE PRISON.

292
00:12:00,761 --> 00:12:02,012
- SO WHEN THOSE GUYS 
KEPT SAYING,

293
00:12:02,012 --> 00:12:04,056
"HEY, YOU, BOY," 
THAT WAS ME?

294
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:08,060
I WAS THE BOY? 
- SOUNDS LIKE IT.

295
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:10,354
SO HAVE YOU TOLD YOUR DAD YOU 
DON'T WANT TO GO TO THAT SCHOOL?

296
00:12:10,354 --> 00:12:11,605
- NO, I'M THINKING 
OF JUST GOING.

297
00:12:11,605 --> 00:12:16,318
I MEAN, THE GRADUATES GO ON 
TO DO GREAT THINGS.

298
00:12:16,318 --> 00:12:17,987
- I SUPPOSE, BUT THAT MEANS 
WE WON'T BE GOING

299
00:12:17,987 --> 00:12:19,238
TO THE SAME HIGH SCHOOL.

300
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:22,074
- MAN, IT JUST KEEPS 
GETTING WORSE.

301
00:12:22,074 --> 00:12:23,909
BUT HE'S MY DAD. 
I DON'T WANT TO DISAPPOINT HIM.

302
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:26,161
- MAN, YOU AND I ARE 
SO DIFFERENT.

303
00:12:26,161 --> 00:12:29,790
IT'S LIKE WE'RE NOT 
EVEN RELATED.

304
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:34,378
- THAT'D BE AMAZING.

305
00:12:34,378 --> 00:12:38,090
OH, MY GOD.

306
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:41,093
- HEY, BUDDY. 
- HEY, DAD.

307
00:12:41,093 --> 00:12:44,096
- I'M SORRY THAT I'M SO LATE, 
BUT I WAS WITH JESSIE.

308
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:45,764
THIS GIRL'S MAKING 
SOME SERIOUS PROGRESS

309
00:12:45,764 --> 00:12:46,891
IN GETTING YOU 
INTO THAT SCHOOL.

310
00:12:46,891 --> 00:12:49,601
SHE JUST BOOKED GOB A GIG 
AT EARL MILFORD'S NURSING HOME.

311
00:12:49,601 --> 00:12:51,896
YOU'RE GONNA BE A SHOO-IN. 
- OH.

312
00:12:51,896 --> 00:12:54,815
- [chuckles] SHE'S KINDA 
SOMETHING, ISN'T SHE?

313
00:12:54,815 --> 00:12:57,026
- YEAH, I GUESS.

314
00:12:57,026 --> 00:13:00,905
- I MEAN, YOU KNOW, HEY, SHE IS 
NO REPLACEMENT FOR YOUR MOM.

315
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:03,073
- OH, NO. NO WAY. 
NOT AT ALL.

316
00:13:03,073 --> 00:13:05,034
SHE'S JUST WORKING FOR US. 
YOU'RE NOT DATING HER.

317
00:13:05,034 --> 00:13:06,618
- NO, I AM NOT DATING HER.

318
00:13:06,618 --> 00:13:08,578
ABSOLUTELY NOT DATING HER.

319
00:13:08,578 --> 00:13:11,623
JUST YOU AND ME. 
THE BLUTH BOYS.

320
00:13:11,623 --> 00:13:13,918
- BLUTH BOYS.

321
00:13:13,918 --> 00:13:16,921
- GOOD NIGHT, BUDDY. 
- GOOD NIGHT.

322
00:13:23,928 --> 00:13:25,012
- HEY. 
- HEY.

323
00:13:25,012 --> 00:13:28,265
- IS HE IN BED? 
- HE'S ON HIS WAY.

324
00:13:28,265 --> 00:13:30,225
HEY, LISTEN, LISTEN, 
LISTEN, LISTEN.

325
00:13:30,225 --> 00:13:35,522
THIS MIGHT BE MOVING A LITTLE 
BIT TOO FAST FOR HIM.

326
00:13:35,522 --> 00:13:37,858
I MEAN FOR--FOR US.

327
00:13:37,858 --> 00:13:40,277
ME. UH, FOR ME.

328
00:13:40,277 --> 00:13:41,736
YOU KNOW, MAYBE WE SHOULD 
TAKE A STEP BACK

329
00:13:41,736 --> 00:13:45,490
AND JUST KEEP THIS RELATIONSHIP 
PROFESSIONAL.

330
00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:47,326
- OH, I THINK THAT WOULD 
TAKE ALL THE FUN OUT OF IT.

331
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:49,494
- NO, NO, NO, NO. 
SERIOUSLY, SERIOUSLY.

332
00:13:49,494 --> 00:13:53,290
YOU'RE AMAZING, BUT I JUST THINK 
WE SHOULD SLOW DOWN.

333
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:54,624
- UH-HUH.

334
00:13:54,624 --> 00:13:58,462
SO THE TWO MONTHS ON THE BIKE, 
THAT WAS, WHAT, FOR MY HEALTH?

335
00:13:58,462 --> 00:14:00,464
- WE HAD GREAT CONVERSATIONS.

336
00:14:00,464 --> 00:14:01,715
SERIOUSLY, 
THIS IS HARD FOR ME.

337
00:14:01,715 --> 00:14:03,383
- THIS IS HARD FOR ME TOO.

338
00:14:03,383 --> 00:14:05,719
I'VE GOT A LIFE TO GET ON TRACK, 
AND I DON'T LIKE WASTING TIME,

339
00:14:05,719 --> 00:14:07,888
SO LET'S DO THIS.

340
00:14:07,888 --> 00:14:10,474
LET'S TAKE TWO STEPS BACK,

341
00:14:10,474 --> 00:14:15,020
AND WHY DON'T YOU FIND YOURSELF 
A NEW PUBLICIST.

342
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:18,440
- JESSIE.

343
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:22,903
NO, I WAS JUST SAYING YOUR NAME 
AS YOU WALKED AWAY.

344
00:14:22,903 --> 00:14:25,530
I DIDN'T--

345
00:14:25,530 --> 00:14:26,991
I HAVE NO FOLLOW-UP.

346
00:14:29,326 --> 00:14:30,577
[door opens and closes]

347
00:14:30,577 --> 00:14:31,954
JESSIE.

348
00:14:31,954 --> 00:14:33,956
narrator: 
MICHAEL FELT BAD,

349
00:14:33,956 --> 00:14:36,166
BUT HE FELT EVEN WORSE WHEN 
HE GOT A CALL FROM HIS BROTHER.

350
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:37,251
- HELLO.

351
00:14:37,251 --> 00:14:39,419
- IT'S GOB. 
I'M LOOKING FOR JESSIE.

352
00:14:39,419 --> 00:14:40,670
- WELL, SHE JUST LEFT, GOB. 
WHAT'S WRONG?

353
00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:42,965
- I NEED HER TO SPIN SOMETHING 
FOR ME.

354
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:44,967
- WELL, THAT'S TOO BAD 
BECAUSE I THINK SHE QUIT.

355
00:14:44,967 --> 00:14:47,511
WHAT DO YOU NEED HER TO SPIN? 
- MURDER.

356
00:14:53,683 --> 00:14:56,436
narrator: MICHAEL WAS SUMMONED 
TO HELP HIS BROTHER.

357
00:14:56,436 --> 00:14:59,564
- MURDER, HUH? WHO DIED? 
- MY CAREER.

358
00:14:59,564 --> 00:15:03,652
- I'M GOING TO GO HOME NOW. 
- I LOST A GUY.

359
00:15:03,652 --> 00:15:05,820
I PUT HIM IN THE AZTEC TOMB, 
AND HE DISAPPEARED.

360
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:08,157
- ISN'T THAT THE POINT? 
- THIS WILL RUIN ME.

361
00:15:08,157 --> 00:15:09,699
- HE'S PROBABLY FINE. 
HE JUST ESCAPED.

362
00:15:09,699 --> 00:15:10,993
- NO! I NEED JESSIE!

363
00:15:10,993 --> 00:15:13,870
- WELL, SHE QUIT WHEN I TOLD HER 
THAT I COULDN'T GO OUT WITH HER.

364
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:15,830
YOU KNOW, I HAVE TO DO 
THE RIGHT THING FOR MY SON.

365
00:15:15,830 --> 00:15:18,292
- THEN YOU BETTER GET HER BACK,

366
00:15:18,292 --> 00:15:20,710
BECAUSE THE GUY I LOST 
WAS EARL MILFORD.

367
00:15:20,710 --> 00:15:24,631
- WHAT? 
- I DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS HIM.

368
00:15:24,631 --> 00:15:26,758
ALTHOUGH HE WAS 
SPECTACULARLY QUIET IN THERE.

369
00:15:26,758 --> 00:15:29,094
YOU KNOW, YOU CAN ALWAYS TELL 
A MILFORD MAN.

370
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:30,429
- GOB, HAVE YOU DESTROYED 
MY CHANCE

371
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:32,056
AT GETTING 
MY SON IN THAT SCHOOL?

372
00:15:32,056 --> 00:15:35,767
- NOT WITH THE RIGHT SPIN.

373
00:15:35,767 --> 00:15:39,771
JESSIE. GET HER BACK.

374
00:15:39,771 --> 00:15:42,566
narrator: CHARGED WITH THE TASK 
OF RENEWING HIS MEDICAL LICENSE,

375
00:15:42,566 --> 00:15:46,528
TOBIAS WAS ENJOYING HIS FIRST 
ACTING CLASS WITH CARL WEATHERS.

376
00:15:46,528 --> 00:15:49,781
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOUR POLICE 
CAPTAIN TOLD YOU ABOUT ME,

377
00:15:49,781 --> 00:15:51,825
BUT I'M A DIFFERENT 
BREED OF COP.

378
00:15:51,825 --> 00:15:56,371
I'M FROM THE STREETS, 
AND I'M THE LAST COP

379
00:15:56,371 --> 00:15:59,416
YOU'RE EVER GONNA WANNA 
MESS WITH IN A DARKENED ALLEY.

380
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:03,795
DARK ALLEY. AND I-- 
[chuckles]

381
00:16:03,795 --> 00:16:05,922
LISTEN, MR. WEATHERS, 
I DON'T KNOW.

382
00:16:05,922 --> 00:16:07,882
PERHAPS MY WIFE WAS RIGHT.

383
00:16:07,882 --> 00:16:11,595
I DON'T KNOW IF I'M CUT OUT 
TO BE A--A DE NIRO

384
00:16:11,595 --> 00:16:15,140
OR A REGIS OR A PINKETT-SMITH 
OR WHAT HAVE YOU.

385
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:17,101
- WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, 
TOBIAS.

386
00:16:17,101 --> 00:16:20,062
DREAMS ARE WORTH 
FIGHTING FOR.

387
00:16:20,062 --> 00:16:24,816
NOW, ARE YOU GONNA BE A FIGHT, 
OR ARE YOU GONNA BE A DOCTOR?

388
00:16:24,816 --> 00:16:26,986
- YOU'RE RIGHT, CARL WEATHERS.

389
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:28,612
I SHOULD JUST MARCH 
INTO THAT RESTAURANT

390
00:16:28,612 --> 00:16:30,822
WHERE MY WIFE WORKS 
AND TELL HER--

391
00:16:30,822 --> 00:16:31,991
- YOUR WIFE WORKS 
IN A RESTAURANT?

392
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:33,033
DO THEY GET A SHIFT MEAL,

393
00:16:33,033 --> 00:16:35,952
OR DO THEY JUST PAY HALF-PRICE 
ON SELECT MENU ITEMS?

394
00:16:35,952 --> 00:16:40,249
- I DON'T KNOW. 
- WELL, LET'S FIND OUT, MAN.

395
00:16:40,249 --> 00:16:42,376
narrator: AND THE PRESS GOT HOLD 
OF GOB'S STORY.

396
00:16:42,376 --> 00:16:46,088
- WHERE IS EARL MILFORD? 
- I--I DON'T KNOW, ALL RIGHT?

397
00:16:46,088 --> 00:16:48,507
I PUT HIM IN A BOX. 
I DIDN'T KILL HIM, ALL RIGHT?

398
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:50,050
AND DON'T EDIT THIS 
FOR YOUR BROADCAST

399
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:52,844
SO IT LOOKS LIKE I'M SCREAMING, 
"I KILLED EARL MILFORD."

400
00:16:52,844 --> 00:16:55,180
- STARTLING CONFESSION, 
TONIGHT AT 11:00.

401
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:57,557
narrator: MINUTES LATER, 
GOB UNLOADED HIS EQUIPMENT

402
00:16:57,557 --> 00:17:00,602
AND MADE A SURPRISING DISCOVERY.

403
00:17:05,274 --> 00:17:06,608
- DON'T SEND ME BACK. 
THEY ABUSE US.

404
00:17:06,608 --> 00:17:09,861
IT'S NOT PLEASANT.

405
00:17:09,861 --> 00:17:11,821
- EARL, I HAVE TO TAKE YOU BACK.

406
00:17:11,821 --> 00:17:13,157
IT'S THE ONLY WAY 
TO CLEAR MY NAME.

407
00:17:13,157 --> 00:17:17,161
- YOU'LL HAVE A NEW NAME: HERO.

408
00:17:17,161 --> 00:17:19,746
- HERO.

409
00:17:19,746 --> 00:17:20,997
THAT COULD WORK FOR ME.

410
00:17:20,997 --> 00:17:22,874
narrator: 
MEANWHILE, JESSIE DECIDED

411
00:17:22,874 --> 00:17:24,876
TO PAY GEORGE MICHAEL A VISIT.

412
00:17:24,876 --> 00:17:27,379
- HI, GEORGE MICHAEL. 
PROUD OF YOURSELF?

413
00:17:27,379 --> 00:17:28,588
- YEAH, ACTUALLY, I GOT A BUM 
AWAY FROM THE STAND

414
00:17:28,588 --> 00:17:29,631
WITHOUT HURTING HIS FEELINGS.

415
00:17:29,631 --> 00:17:32,301
THAT WAS PRETTY SWEET. 
- NO. I MEAN ABOUT YOUR FATHER.

416
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:34,636
ABOUT DENYING HIM 
HIS CHANCE TO BE HAPPY.

417
00:17:34,636 --> 00:17:37,639
- YOU'RE INTO THAT TOO? 
I'M RUBBING OFF ON YOU, HUH?

418
00:17:37,639 --> 00:17:39,849
- NO. 
I WANT MY DAD TO BE HAPPY.

419
00:17:39,849 --> 00:17:42,311
- WELL, IT'S TOO LATE NOW. 
I'VE SEEN TO THAT.

420
00:17:42,311 --> 00:17:45,480
DADDY LOST HIS SHOT AT HAPPY, 
AND IT'S ALL YOUR FAULT, OPIE.

421
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:46,815
narrator: 
JESSIE HAD GONE TOO FAR,

422
00:17:46,815 --> 00:17:48,817
AND SHE HAD BEST WATCH 
HER MOUTH.

423
00:17:48,817 --> 00:17:51,653
- MICHAEL'S ABOUT TO BECOME 
THE MOST UNLIKABLE MAN IN TOWN.

424
00:17:51,653 --> 00:17:54,864
CHECK THE PAPERS.

425
00:17:54,864 --> 00:17:57,659
- SHE KIND OF REMINDS ME 
OF MY MOTHER.

426
00:17:57,659 --> 00:18:00,162
narrator: AND LATER THAT NIGHT, 
LINDSAY WAS WORKING AT RUD.

427
00:18:00,162 --> 00:18:03,957
- YOU SEEM LIKE A MAN 
OF TASTE AND CLASS.

428
00:18:03,957 --> 00:18:06,668
- I'LL GIVE YOU $2,000 
TO TOUCH ME.

429
00:18:06,668 --> 00:18:10,672
- [chuckles] 
OH, MY GOD. MY HUSBAND.

430
00:18:10,672 --> 00:18:11,965
- YOU'RE MARRIED 
TO CARL WEATHERS?

431
00:18:11,965 --> 00:18:14,301
- [bleep] WHAT'S GOING ON?

432
00:18:14,301 --> 00:18:16,428
WHY ARE YOU HERE? 
WHY AREN'T YOU IN BOSTON?

433
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:17,679
WHO'S HE?

434
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:20,765
- HIS NAME IS CARL WEATHERS, 
AND HE'S MY NEW ACTING TEACHER.

435
00:18:20,765 --> 00:18:24,686
AND, LINDSAY, HE'S TEACHING ME 
ALL THESE VALUABLE LIFE LESSONS.

436
00:18:24,686 --> 00:18:26,062
- I BUY ALL MY CARS 
AT POLICE AUCTION.

437
00:18:26,062 --> 00:18:28,357
- HE'S FULL OF STUFF LIKE THAT.

438
00:18:28,357 --> 00:18:34,488
AND, LINDSAY, HE'S TEACHING ME 
TO FOLLOW MY DREAMS.

439
00:18:34,488 --> 00:18:37,449
- GIVE ME A BOURBON.

440
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:40,119
- ANY ROOM ON THAT TAB 
FOR ME TO JUMP ON?

441
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:41,995
narrator: AND MICHAEL CAUGHT UP 
WITH JESSIE.

442
00:18:41,995 --> 00:18:43,955
- LISTEN, THANKS FOR COMING.

443
00:18:43,955 --> 00:18:46,125
I WAS JUST-- 
I WAS DOING SOME THINKING.

444
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:48,377
AND, YOU KNOW, I PULLED AWAY, 
AND THAT WAS WRONG.

445
00:18:48,377 --> 00:18:49,628
I REALLY WANT 
TO MAKE THIS WORK.

446
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:51,838
- GET AWAY FROM MY SON!

447
00:18:51,838 --> 00:18:54,466
- HEY, MOM. 
KIND OF ON A DATE HERE.

448
00:18:54,466 --> 00:18:57,427
- YOU'LL CHANGE YOUR MIND 
AFTER THIS.

449
00:18:57,427 --> 00:18:59,679
narrator: 
AND MICHAEL SAW THE STORY

450
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:02,724
THAT JESSIE HAD PLANTED.

451
00:19:02,724 --> 00:19:05,685
- LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING, 
SWEETIE.

452
00:19:05,685 --> 00:19:07,937
WE MAY PICK ON EACH OTHER, 
GET INTO LITTLE SCRAPES,

453
00:19:07,937 --> 00:19:09,189
CALL EACH OTHER NAMES,

454
00:19:09,189 --> 00:19:10,774
AND OCCASIONALLY STEAL 
FROM EACH OTHER,

455
00:19:10,774 --> 00:19:13,026
BUT THAT'S BECAUSE 
WE'RE A FAMILY.

456
00:19:13,026 --> 00:19:14,778
YOU HAVE NO RIGHT. 
YOU DON'T GET TO DO THAT.

457
00:19:14,778 --> 00:19:17,739
- "LINDSAY'S A COMBATIVE, 
ENTITLED PRINCESS"?

458
00:19:17,739 --> 00:19:19,908
I SHOULD HIRE SOMEBODY 
TO KICK YOUR ASS FOR THAT.

459
00:19:19,908 --> 00:19:21,160
- SAVE YOUR MONEY.

460
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,161
- YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT. 
I'LL DO IT MYSELF.

461
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:23,495
- HEY, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA!

462
00:19:23,495 --> 00:19:25,914
WE ARE NOT SETTLING THINGS 
LIKE THAT ANYMORE, ALL RIGHT?

463
00:19:25,914 --> 00:19:27,582
I DON'T NEED MY SON READING 
ANY MORE ARTICLES

464
00:19:27,582 --> 00:19:28,958
ABOUT US IN THE PAPER.

465
00:19:28,958 --> 00:19:30,502
- OH, YOU AND YOUR SON.

466
00:19:30,502 --> 00:19:32,629
STOP USING HIM AS AN EXCUSE 
FOR EVERYTHING YOU DO.

467
00:19:32,629 --> 00:19:33,963
- I SAW HIM TODAY. 
HE'S FINE WITH US.

468
00:19:33,963 --> 00:19:35,382
- WAIT, WHAT? YOU SAW HIM TODAY? 
- YEAH.

469
00:19:35,382 --> 00:19:37,717
I TOLD HIM HE WAS GETTING 
IN THE WAY OF YOUR HAPPINESS.

470
00:19:37,717 --> 00:19:40,429
- YOU DID? 
YOU SAID THAT TO MY SON?

471
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:43,890
- YEAH.

472
00:19:43,890 --> 00:19:47,060
- YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN. 
LADIES?

473
00:19:50,730 --> 00:19:54,901
- FOOD FIGHT!

474
00:19:54,901 --> 00:19:57,487
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

475
00:19:57,487 --> 00:20:00,657
OH, MY FACE!

476
00:20:00,657 --> 00:20:03,993
I'M GONNA GET YOU GUYS! 
STOP!

477
00:20:03,993 --> 00:20:06,663
- THE PRESS IS HAVING 
A LOVE AFFAIR

478
00:20:06,663 --> 00:20:09,040
WITH HATING 
THE BLUTH FAMILY,

479
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:12,669
AND THEY WERE THE CENTER OF 
ANOTHER BRAWL THIS EVENING.

480
00:20:12,669 --> 00:20:16,381
- I'M LOOKING AT $50,000 WORTH 
OF MEDICAL BILLS HERE.

481
00:20:16,381 --> 00:20:18,425
- WELL, IT LOOKS LIKE YOU WON'T 
BE GETTING INTO THIS SCHOOL.

482
00:20:18,425 --> 00:20:19,551
ARE YOU DISAPPOINTED?

483
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:21,845
- WELL, ARE YOU DISAPPOINTED?

484
00:20:21,845 --> 00:20:23,096
- LOOK, GEORGE MICHAEL,

485
00:20:23,096 --> 00:20:25,599
I WANT YOU TO TELL ME 
HOW YOU FEEL, OKAY?

486
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:27,809
I DON'T WANT YOU TO WORRY SO 
MUCH ABOUT HURTING MY FEELINGS.
