00:00:01,501 --> 00:00:03,378
male narrator: NOW THE STORY 
OF A WEALTHY FAMILY

2
00:00:03,378 --> 00:00:04,462
WHO LOST EVERYTHING

3
00:00:04,462 --> 00:00:06,631
AND THE ONE SON 
WHO HAD NO CHOICE

4
00:00:06,631 --> 00:00:09,634
BUT TO KEEP THEM ALL TOGETHER.

5
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:17,017
IT'S "ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT."

6
00:00:21,312 --> 00:00:23,523
IT WAS MICHAEL'S SISTER'S 
ANNIVERSARY,

7
00:00:23,523 --> 00:00:26,484
AND HE'D CONVINCED HIS MOTHER 
TO THROW A PARTY FOR HER.

8
00:00:26,484 --> 00:00:29,029
- LINDSAY, HOW'S THIS 
FOR AN ANNIVERSARY CAKE?

9
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:30,863
- ANNIVERSARY?

10
00:00:30,863 --> 00:00:33,199
YOU ASKED ME TO THROW 
A VALENTINE'S DAY PARTY.

11
00:00:33,199 --> 00:00:35,285
- DID I? 
- YOU TRICKED ME.

12
00:00:35,285 --> 00:00:36,452
- I DECEIVED YOU, MOM.

13
00:00:36,452 --> 00:00:38,913
TRICKED MAKES IT SOUND LIKE 
WE HAVE A PLAYFUL RELATIONSHIP.

14
00:00:38,913 --> 00:00:44,043
- TOUCHE 
LUPE, UNTIE THE BALLOONS!

15
00:00:44,043 --> 00:00:47,463
- MICHAEL, ALL ALONE 
ON VALENTINE'S DAY?

16
00:00:47,463 --> 00:00:48,964
HOW'S THAT POSSIBLE?

17
00:00:48,964 --> 00:00:51,342
YOU SEEM LIKE SUCH 
A ROMANTIC TO ME.

18
00:00:51,342 --> 00:00:55,513
I-I-I CAN JUST SEE YOU SHOWING 
UP ON SOME LUCKY GIRL'S PORCH

19
00:00:55,513 --> 00:00:58,766
IN A TUXEDO 
WITH A BOTTLE OF CHAMPAGNE.

20
00:00:58,766 --> 00:01:00,643
- YEAH, WELL, IF I SHOW UP 
WITH ALL THAT STUFF,

21
00:01:00,643 --> 00:01:01,936
I COULD PROBABLY JUST GET AWAY 
WITH SHORTS

22
00:01:01,936 --> 00:01:03,063
AND A T-SHIRT, RIGHT?

23
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:05,148
WHICH IS GOOD, 'CAUSE I DON'T 
EVEN HAVE A TUXEDO.

24
00:01:05,148 --> 00:01:08,025
- SO YOU'RE SAYING THERE'S NO 
ONE YOU'RE EVEN INTERESTED IN?

25
00:01:08,025 --> 00:01:10,653
narrator: IN FACT, MICHAEL 
HAD BECOME ENAMORED OF MARTA

26
00:01:10,653 --> 00:01:13,156
WHEN GOB WAS HAVING SECOND 
THOUGHTS ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIP.

27
00:01:13,156 --> 00:01:14,949
- I'VE MADE A HUGE MISTAKE.

28
00:01:14,949 --> 00:01:16,534
narrator: BUT WHEN 
GOB RECOMMITTED TO HER...

29
00:01:16,534 --> 00:01:18,078
- I'VE MADE A HUGE MISTAKE.

30
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:20,580
narrator: MICHAEL DECIDED TO DO 
THE NOBLE THING AND LET HER GO.

31
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:22,039
- MM, THERE WAS SOMEBODY 
FOR A LITTLE WHILE,

32
00:01:22,039 --> 00:01:25,418
BUT IT WAS TOO MUCH 
OF A BROTHER--BOTHER.

33
00:01:31,549 --> 00:01:34,469
- THAT CAN'T FEEL GOOD.

34
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:37,305
- IT'S FINE; I'M OVER IT. 
I'M OKAY BY MYSELF, YOU KNOW?

35
00:01:37,305 --> 00:01:39,432
I REALLY JUST WANT TO FOCUS 
ON MY FAMILY'S HAPPINESS.

36
00:01:39,432 --> 00:01:42,935
THAT'S WHY I THREW THIS PARTY. 
I MEAN, 14 YEARS, HUH?

37
00:01:42,935 --> 00:01:44,520
YOU'VE GOT TO BE DOING 
SOMETHING RIGHT.

38
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:47,815
- WELL, IF YOU CALL NOT FILING 
FOR DIVORCE "SOMETHING RIGHT."

39
00:01:47,815 --> 00:01:49,192
BUT I GUESS 
WE KEEP IT INTERESTING.

40
00:01:49,192 --> 00:01:50,235
- WHERE'S TOBIAS?

41
00:01:50,235 --> 00:01:52,903
- HE'S ON THE BALCONY HAVING 
MARGARITAS WITH CARL WEATHERS.

42
00:01:52,903 --> 00:01:55,365
narrator: TOBIAS HAD RECENTLY 
HIRED ACTOR CARL WEATHERS

43
00:01:55,365 --> 00:01:56,824
AS A DRAMA COACH.

44
00:01:56,824 --> 00:01:59,410
- DO YOU SEE ME MORE AS 
THE RESPECTED DRAMATIC ACTOR,

45
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:01,371
OR MORE 
OF THE BELOVED COMIC ACTOR?

46
00:02:01,371 --> 00:02:02,622
- WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

47
00:02:02,622 --> 00:02:04,290
THERE'S STILL PLENTY OF MEAT 
ON THAT BONE.

48
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:05,833
NOW, YOU TAKE THIS HOME, 
THROW IT IN A POT,

49
00:02:05,833 --> 00:02:09,545
ADD SOME BROTH, A POTATO-- 
BABY, YOU GOT A STEW GOING.

50
00:02:09,545 --> 00:02:10,546
- YES, THAT'S FINE.

51
00:02:10,546 --> 00:02:13,090
BUT I WOULD LIKE TO FOCUS 
ON MY ACTING, MR. WEATHERS.

52
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:16,261
I DID GIVE YOU 
MY LAST $1,100.

53
00:02:16,261 --> 00:02:18,346
- LET ME TELL YOU A LITTLE STORY 
ABOUT ACTING.

54
00:02:18,346 --> 00:02:22,057
I WAS DOING THIS SHOWTIME MOVIE, 
"HOT ICE," WITH ANNE ARCHER.

55
00:02:22,057 --> 00:02:24,144
NEVER ONCE 
TOUCHED MY PER DIEM.

56
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:26,812
I GO TO CRAFT SERVICE, 
GET SOME RAW VEGGIES,

57
00:02:26,812 --> 00:02:28,398
BACON, CUP OF SOUP--

58
00:02:28,398 --> 00:02:31,776
[chuckles] 
BABY, I HAD A STEW GOING.

59
00:02:31,776 --> 00:02:34,570
- I THINK I'D LIKE 
MY MONEY BACK.

60
00:02:39,575 --> 00:02:41,786
narrator: LIKE HIS FATHER, 
GEORGE MICHAEL HAD BEEN

61
00:02:41,786 --> 00:02:43,788
NURSING AN IMPOSSIBLE CRUSH.

62
00:02:43,788 --> 00:02:45,915
IT WAS ON HIS COUSIN, MAEBY.

63
00:02:45,915 --> 00:02:47,625
AND WITH NO ONE TO TALK TO, 
HE WAS LOOKING

64
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:49,294
FOR SOME KIND OF DIRECTION.

65
00:02:49,294 --> 00:02:51,546
- JUST GIVE ME A SIGN.

66
00:02:54,089 --> 00:02:58,636
[chuckles] FIRST ONE'S OBVIOUS. 
OKAY.

67
00:02:58,636 --> 00:03:01,306
narrator: HE CONTINUED 
TO LOOK FOR A SIGN.

68
00:03:01,306 --> 00:03:03,098
UNTIL FINALLY...

69
00:03:03,098 --> 00:03:04,850
- "MAYBE TONIGHT."

70
00:03:04,850 --> 00:03:06,311
- WHAT ARE THE CHANCES?

71
00:03:06,311 --> 00:03:07,520
narrator: 
ACTUALLY, "MAYBE TONIGHT"

72
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:10,064
WAS A VERY POPULAR 
CANDY SLOGAN,

73
00:03:10,064 --> 00:03:12,317
AND THE CHANCES 
WERE ONE IN EIGHT.

74
00:03:12,317 --> 00:03:13,484
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

75
00:03:13,484 --> 00:03:14,985
- JUST TRYING TO THROW STUFF 
AT MY DAD'S HEAD,

76
00:03:14,985 --> 00:03:16,028
BUT THE WIND 
KEEPS TAKING IT.

77
00:03:16,028 --> 00:03:17,322
- OH, COOL.

78
00:03:17,322 --> 00:03:19,156
SO, I, UH-- 
I FOUND THIS.

79
00:03:19,156 --> 00:03:20,616
I THOUGHT IT WAS LIKE 
A ONE-IN-A-MILLION THING.

80
00:03:20,616 --> 00:03:22,410
IT JUST MADE ME THINK OF YOU.

81
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:24,495
- OH, PERFECT.

82
00:03:24,495 --> 00:03:26,914
- TRYING TO MAKE MY RELATION--

83
00:03:26,914 --> 00:03:27,915
I SAW THAT.

84
00:03:27,915 --> 00:03:29,208
narrator: AND LUCILLE 
FOUND A WAY

85
00:03:29,208 --> 00:03:31,627
TO FORCE A WEDGE 
INTO HER SON'S RELATIONSHIP.

86
00:03:31,627 --> 00:03:35,215
- LUCILLE, GUESS WHO'S COMING 
TO DINNER?

87
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:38,551
I'VE INVITED CARL 
TO DINE WITH US NEXT TUESDAY.

88
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:41,429
- MOTHER, YOU KNOW 
I HAVE CLASS ON TUESDAY.

89
00:03:41,429 --> 00:03:44,724
- [sighs] OH, HOW SILLY OF ME.

90
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:48,228
WELL, THEN PERHAPS THE TWO 
OF YOU CAN HAVE DINNER ALONE.

91
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:49,979
- OH, WELL, 
I NEVER SAY NO TO DINNER,

92
00:03:49,979 --> 00:03:52,106
WITH A BEAUTIFUL LADY THAT IS.

93
00:03:52,106 --> 00:03:56,652
- DO YOU LIKE HAM? 
- NO. I LOVE IT.

94
00:03:56,652 --> 00:03:59,655
[both laughing]

95
00:03:59,655 --> 00:04:01,866
narrator: AND THE FAMILY 
GATHERED TO WATCH A VIDEOTAPE

96
00:04:01,866 --> 00:04:05,870
GEORGE SR. HAD SENT LINDSAY AND 
TOBIAS FOR THEIR ANNIVERSARY.

97
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:08,581
- HELLO, I'M GEORGE BLUTH,

98
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:11,251
AND FOR THE NEXT 45 MINUTES,

99
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:13,002
LET ME TAKE YOU ON A JOURNEY--

100
00:04:13,002 --> 00:04:14,420
- GOOD GRIEF!

101
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:17,089
HE SENT US ONE OF HIS 
IDIOT VIDEOTAPES.

102
00:04:17,089 --> 00:04:18,258
- FIRST THIS.

103
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:20,050
- YOU'VE SEEN 
GEORGE BLUTH ON VIDEOTAPE.

104
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:23,095
- YOU HAVE GOT TO LEARN 
TO BE ALONE.

105
00:04:23,095 --> 00:04:27,016
I CHEATED, AND I LIED, 
AND I WHORED AROUND.

106
00:04:27,016 --> 00:04:30,270
- "CAGED WISDOM" 
CHANGED MY LIFE.

107
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,271
- NOW IS YOUR CHANCE TO OWN

108
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:33,481
THE ENTIRE GEORGE BLUTH 
"CAGED WISDOM" LIBRARY

109
00:04:33,481 --> 00:04:34,732
FOR ONLY FOUR PAYMENTS 
OF $19.95.

110
00:04:34,732 --> 00:04:37,151
- THIS WAS SUPPOSED TO BE 
MY ANNIVERSARY TOAST.

111
00:04:37,151 --> 00:04:41,030
- YEAH, AND THIS WAS SUPPOSED 
TO BE MY VALENTINE'S DAY PARTY.

112
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:43,115
SPEAKING OF WHICH...

113
00:04:43,115 --> 00:04:45,451
LUPE, WHERE ARE 
THOSE BALLOONS?

114
00:04:45,451 --> 00:04:48,496
- YOU WANT BALLOONS?

115
00:04:48,496 --> 00:04:52,417
- SPEECH, SPEECH, SPEECH--

116
00:04:52,417 --> 00:04:56,587
all: SPEECH, SPEECH, SPEECH, 
SPEECH, SPEECH,

117
00:04:56,587 --> 00:04:59,299
SPEECH, SPEECH, SPEECH, SPEECH--

118
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:00,300
- COME ON, SPEECH.

119
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,842
all: SPEECH, SPEECH, SPEECH, 
SPEECH--

120
00:05:01,842 --> 00:05:03,553
narrator: 
THE FAMILY CONTINUED TO CHANT,

121
00:05:03,553 --> 00:05:08,015
"SPEECH, SPEECH, SPEECH," 
FOR NO ONE IN PARTICULAR.

122
00:05:08,015 --> 00:05:11,018
- ALL RIGHT. 
all: SPEECH, SPEECH.

123
00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:15,731
- GEE, AFTER ALL THAT, 
I WAS KIND OF HOPING

124
00:05:15,731 --> 00:05:17,066
SOMEBODY WOULD MAKE A SPEECH.

125
00:05:17,066 --> 00:05:18,108
- SPEECH, SPEECH, SPEECH--

126
00:05:18,108 --> 00:05:19,193
- ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT, 
ALL RIGHT.

127
00:05:19,193 --> 00:05:20,486
I'LL SAY SOMETHING.

128
00:05:20,486 --> 00:05:21,487
- TYPICAL.

129
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:23,323
- WE'VE ALL HAD 
A TOUGH COUPLE OF MONTHS.

130
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:25,866
I THINK WE'RE ALL REALLY 
FIGURING OUT WHO WE ARE

131
00:05:25,866 --> 00:05:27,618
AND WHAT WE REALLY 
NEED IN LIFE.

132
00:05:27,618 --> 00:05:29,870
AND THAT CAN BE PAINFUL.

133
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:31,622
HOWEVER, YOU CAN'T REALLY 
HEAL YOURSELF

134
00:05:31,622 --> 00:05:34,166
UNTIL YOU STOP 
LIVING A LIE, YOU KNOW.

135
00:05:34,166 --> 00:05:36,043
BUT, UH, I-I PROMISE 
THAT WE'RE ALL GONNA BE

136
00:05:36,043 --> 00:05:38,003
A LOT HAPPIER IN THE LONG RUN.

137
00:05:38,003 --> 00:05:40,548
SO, ON A VERY UNUSUAL 
VALENTINE'S DAY,

138
00:05:40,548 --> 00:05:45,428
CHEERS TO MOM AND DAD, 
TO BUSTER AND LUCILLE--

139
00:05:45,428 --> 00:05:47,346
- [chuckling] 
DON'T FORGET MY GIRLFRIEND.

140
00:05:47,346 --> 00:05:48,347
- THAT'S WHO I MEANT.

141
00:05:48,347 --> 00:05:52,727
TO LINDSAY AND TOBIAS, 
TO GEORGE MICHAEL AND--

142
00:05:52,727 --> 00:05:55,062
I ALMOST SAID GEORGE MICHAEL 
AND MAEBY [chuckles].

143
00:05:55,062 --> 00:05:56,689
- OH. [laughing]

144
00:05:56,689 --> 00:05:58,608
- UM, TO GOB AND MARTA.

145
00:05:58,608 --> 00:06:00,485
- MMM. 
- TO LOVE AND HAPPINESS.

146
00:06:00,485 --> 00:06:03,404
I LOVE YOU ALL, MARTA.

147
00:06:03,404 --> 00:06:06,657
narrator: AND MARTA REALIZED 
IT WAS MICHAEL, NOT GOB,

148
00:06:06,657 --> 00:06:09,284
WHO HAD EVERYTHING SHE HAD BEEN 
LOOKING FOR IN A MAN.

149
00:06:09,284 --> 00:06:12,287
- I'VE MADE A HUGE MISTAKE.

150
00:06:17,334 --> 00:06:19,253
- I WAS THINKING ABOUT 
THAT TOAST YOU GAVE

151
00:06:19,253 --> 00:06:20,880
AT MY ANNIVERSARY PARTY.

152
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,215
SO, I WANT TO GET A DIVORCE. 
- WHAT?

153
00:06:23,215 --> 00:06:24,884
- DO YOU THINK I SHOULD USE 
OUR ATTORNEY, BARRY,

154
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:26,511
OR JUST 
KIND OF BOLT IN THE NIGHT?

155
00:06:26,511 --> 00:06:28,679
I'M LEANING TOWARD 
BOLT IN THE NIGHT, BUT--

156
00:06:28,679 --> 00:06:29,722
- WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

157
00:06:29,722 --> 00:06:31,641
LINDSAY, I WASN'T TALKING 
ABOUT GETTING A DIVORCE.

158
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:34,477
- OH, MICHAEL. 
[sighs] IT'S TIME.

159
00:06:34,477 --> 00:06:36,061
THE MAN'S 
PSYCHOLOGICALLY INCAPABLE

160
00:06:36,061 --> 00:06:37,897
OF TAKING 
ALL OF HIS CLOTHES OFF.

161
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:41,191
narrator: IN FACT, 
TOBIAS WAS A NEVER-NUDE.

162
00:06:41,191 --> 00:06:42,860
AS OF YET, THE D.S.M.-IV

163
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:44,862
HAS NOT ACKNOWLEDGED 
THE AFFLICTION.

164
00:06:44,862 --> 00:06:47,782
- I DON'T KNOW, LINDSAY. 
I MEAN, WHO AM I TO JUDGE?

165
00:06:47,782 --> 00:06:49,825
ON THE OTHER HAND, 
I AM DOING IT ANYWAY,

166
00:06:49,825 --> 00:06:52,161
SO LET ME SUGGEST, 
BEFORE YOU TALK DIVORCE,

167
00:06:52,161 --> 00:06:55,164
AT LEAST CONSIDER A SEPARATION. 
YOU KNOW, YOU DO HAVE A KID.

168
00:06:55,164 --> 00:06:56,165
- I KNOW.

169
00:06:56,165 --> 00:06:57,542
I WAS GONNA TAKE HER 
WITH ME IN THE NIGHT.

170
00:06:57,542 --> 00:06:58,918
SHE'S PART OF THE BOLT.

171
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:00,628
- LINDSAY.

172
00:07:00,628 --> 00:07:02,087
- ALL RIGHT. 
I'LL THINK ABOUT IT.

173
00:07:02,087 --> 00:07:03,172
[phone rings]

174
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:06,967
- HELLO? 
- HEY, BROTHER.

175
00:07:06,967 --> 00:07:08,553
I JUST WANT TO TELL YOU 
HOW MUCH I ENJOYED

176
00:07:08,553 --> 00:07:10,471
YOUR SPEECH YESTERDAY.

177
00:07:10,471 --> 00:07:13,558
YOU KNOW, ABOUT FAMILY AND-- 
AND BEING TRUE TO OURSELVES.

178
00:07:13,558 --> 00:07:16,393
- OH, WELL, I'M-- 
I'M GLAD IT MADE AN IMPACT.

179
00:07:16,393 --> 00:07:17,562
- YEAH.

180
00:07:17,562 --> 00:07:19,605
I NEVER WANT TO LOOK 
AT MOM AGAIN.

181
00:07:19,605 --> 00:07:20,856
- [sighs] WHAT HAPPENED?

182
00:07:20,856 --> 00:07:25,402
- WELL, I CAN'T REALLY TALK. 
SHE MIGHT BE LISTENING IN.

183
00:07:25,402 --> 00:07:29,449
DO YOU KNOW SHE TRIED TO 
SET UP MY GIRLFRIEND WITH A MAN?

184
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:31,283
THIS HAS TO STOP.

185
00:07:31,283 --> 00:07:33,285
- YOU KNOW, THAT'S NOT REALLY 
WHAT I WAS GOING FOR.

186
00:07:33,285 --> 00:07:37,164
- I'M A MAN, MIKE! 
I'M A MAN.

187
00:07:37,164 --> 00:07:39,208
- CAN I THROW OUT THIS YOGURT?

188
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:40,626
- BUSTER, TWO THINGS.

189
00:07:40,626 --> 00:07:41,836
FIRST OF ALL, 
I THINK IT MIGHT BE TIME

190
00:07:41,836 --> 00:07:43,128
FOR YOU TO MOVE OUT, YOU KNOW?

191
00:07:43,128 --> 00:07:44,171
AND SECONDLY,

192
00:07:44,171 --> 00:07:46,215
YOU DON'T WANT TO TAKE ANY 
CHANCES WITH YOGURT, MOM.

193
00:07:46,215 --> 00:07:47,550
JUST LET HER THROW IT OUT.

194
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:49,552
- HE-HELLO? 
WHO'S ON THIS PHONE?

195
00:07:49,552 --> 00:07:51,554
- HUH?

196
00:07:52,555 --> 00:07:54,098
- MICHAEL? 
- HEY.

197
00:07:54,098 --> 00:07:55,432
- GREAT SPEECH LAST NIGHT.

198
00:07:55,432 --> 00:07:56,433
- OH, REALLY?

199
00:07:56,433 --> 00:07:57,893
WHAT DID IT INSPIRE 
YOU TO DO, KILL SOMEBODY?

200
00:07:57,893 --> 00:07:59,895
- GETTING THERE. 
MARTA'S CHEATING ON ME.

201
00:07:59,895 --> 00:08:01,481
- WHAT? 
- YEAH, CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT?

202
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:03,941
- THAT'S CRAZY, GOB. 
SHE'S NOT A CHEATER.

203
00:08:03,941 --> 00:08:06,777
I MEAN, IF SHE WERE TO CHEAT, 
I'D LIKE TO THINK SHE'D CHEAT--

204
00:08:06,777 --> 00:08:07,820
YOU'RE THE CHEATER.

205
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:09,446
- THAT'S HOW I KNOW 
ALL THE SIGNS.

206
00:08:09,446 --> 00:08:11,491
LAST NIGHT SHE WAS 
ALL DISTANT AND WEIRD.

207
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:13,993
WOULDN'T LET ME MAKE LOVE 
TO HER ON MOM'S BED.

208
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:14,994
I DON'T EVEN WANT 
TO TELL YOU

209
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:16,829
WHAT SHE WOULDN'T 
LET ME DO TO HER IN THE CAR.

210
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:19,123
AND THEN TODAY, I OVERHEAR 
HER TALKING ON THE PHONE

211
00:08:19,123 --> 00:08:21,166
ABOUT SOMEBODY 
ALL SUPER SILENTLY.

212
00:08:21,166 --> 00:08:22,585
ALL IN SPANISH.

213
00:08:22,585 --> 00:08:24,128
narrator: IN FACT, 
MARTA WAS ON THE PHONE

214
00:08:24,128 --> 00:08:26,130
WITH HER MOTHER 
TALKING ABOUT MICHAEL.

215
00:08:33,345 --> 00:08:36,974
- SHE KEPT USING THIS GUY'S 
NAME, LIKE, "HERMANO."

216
00:08:36,974 --> 00:08:37,975
- LET ME 
TELL YOU SOMETHING, GOB.

217
00:08:37,975 --> 00:08:39,977
WE'RE GONNA TRACK 
THIS "HERMANO" DOWN, OKAY,

218
00:08:39,977 --> 00:08:41,145
AND WE'RE GONNA NAIL HIM.

219
00:08:41,145 --> 00:08:42,354
'CAUSE IF ANYONE'S 
GONNA GO OUT WITH THAT GIRL,

220
00:08:42,354 --> 00:08:43,355
IT'S GONNA BE ONE OF US.

221
00:08:43,355 --> 00:08:47,026
- RIGHT--ME. 
- AND I'M OKAY WITH THAT.

222
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:50,404
- I DON'T GET IT. 
WHY DO WE HAVE TO CHANGE ROOMS?

223
00:08:50,404 --> 00:08:53,783
- COUSINS OF THE OPPOSITE GENDER 
SHOULDN'T BE SHARING A ROOM.

224
00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:55,450
- BUT THAT'S JUST THE POINT. 
I MEAN, WE'RE COUSINS.

225
00:08:55,450 --> 00:08:57,494
YOU KNOW, GENDER HAS NOTHING 
TO DO WITH IT.

226
00:08:57,494 --> 00:08:58,538
I MEAN, COUSINS CAN 
BUNK TOGETHER.

227
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:00,372
THAT'S WHY THEY CALL IT 
"BUNKIN' COUSINS."

228
00:09:00,372 --> 00:09:01,582
- ACTUALLY, THEY CALL IT 
"KISSIN' COUSINS."

229
00:09:01,582 --> 00:09:03,083
- WE'RE NOT KISSING! 
THAT'S THE POINT!

230
00:09:03,083 --> 00:09:04,418
narrator: GEORGE MICHAEL 
WAS CONCERNED

231
00:09:04,418 --> 00:09:06,336
THAT TOBIAS HAD SEEN 
THE CANDY HEART

232
00:09:06,336 --> 00:09:08,964
THAT SAID "MAYBE TONIGHT" 
AND HAD FIGURED OUT

233
00:09:08,964 --> 00:09:10,550
THAT HE HAD 
A CRUSH ON HIS COUSIN.

234
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:11,551
- BESIDES, I DON'T EVEN CARE.

235
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:12,760
YOU KNOW, FIRST YOU SAID 
SHARE A ROOM WITH HER,

236
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:13,886
I SHARED A ROOM WITH HER.

237
00:09:13,886 --> 00:09:15,470
NOW YOU'RE SAYING DON'T SHARE 
A ROOM WITH HER.

238
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:16,889
FINE. 
I'M JUST DOING WHATEVER YOU SAY.

239
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:18,641
YOU KNOW, THE ADULTS MAKING 
ALL THE DECISIONS AROUND HERE.

240
00:09:18,641 --> 00:09:20,517
WHY AM I IN TROUBLE? 
- YOU'RE NOT IN TROUBLE.

241
00:09:20,517 --> 00:09:24,271
WE'RE ALL JUST GONNA HAVE 
A MORE NORMAL ARRANGEMENT.

242
00:09:24,271 --> 00:09:25,940
I'M GONNA SLEEP 
WITH MY DAUGHTER,

243
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:28,651
AND YOU'RE 
GONNA SLEEP WITH MY HUSBAND.

244
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:30,402
narrator: BUSTER HAD TAKEN 
MICHAEL'S ADVICE

245
00:09:30,402 --> 00:09:32,780
AND DECIDED 
TO CONFRONT HIS MOTHER.

246
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:35,282
- [sniffing]

247
00:09:35,282 --> 00:09:38,410
"BECAUSE YOU KNOW I DON'T 
APPRECIATE HOW YOU TREAT ME.

248
00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:42,081
I AM NOT A CHILD, MOTHER."

249
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:44,083
[sniffs]

250
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:46,586
- [sighs] BLOW.

251
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:49,589
- NO, MOTHER! 
I CAN BLOW MYSELF.

252
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:51,882
AND YOU HAVE INTERFERED 
FOR THE LAST TIME.

253
00:09:51,882 --> 00:09:53,718
- FINE.

254
00:09:53,718 --> 00:09:56,679
GO. 
MOVE OUT.

255
00:10:04,895 --> 00:10:07,898
narrator: SO, BUSTER 
LOADED UP HIS POSSESSIONS

256
00:10:07,898 --> 00:10:10,901
AND EMANCIPATED HIMSELF 
FROM HIS MOTHER.

257
00:10:14,989 --> 00:10:18,784
- [muffled laughter]

258
00:10:18,784 --> 00:10:21,621
OH, HEY, BUSTER. 
I THOUGHT YOU HAD CLASS.

259
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:23,288
- I THOUGHT YOU HAD CLASS.

260
00:10:23,288 --> 00:10:24,414
MY BROTHER-IN-LAW FIRES YOU,

261
00:10:24,414 --> 00:10:25,625
AND YOU MOVE IN 
ON MY GIRLFRIEND?

262
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:26,834
- COME ON, NOW. 
WAIT A MINUTE.

263
00:10:26,834 --> 00:10:28,628
THIS IS JUST PURELY 
A SOCIAL CALL.

264
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:31,088
YOU KNOW, JUST TWO ADULTS 
GETTING A STEW ON, MAN.

265
00:10:31,088 --> 00:10:34,424
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS, 
BUT IT SOUNDS DISGUSTING.

266
00:10:34,424 --> 00:10:36,886
- HEY, BUSTER. 
GEE, I THOUGHT YOU HAD CLASS.

267
00:10:36,886 --> 00:10:40,640
- I THOUGHT YOU HAD CLASS!

268
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,516
I WANT TO MOVE IN WITH YOU.

269
00:10:42,516 --> 00:10:45,645
I'M TIRED OF MY MOM 
TRYING TO CONTROL ME.

270
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:47,354
- WAIT A MINUTE.

271
00:10:47,354 --> 00:10:50,607
ARE YOU SURE YOU'RE DOING THIS 
BECAUSE YOU WANT TO BE WITH ME,

272
00:10:50,607 --> 00:10:52,777
AND NOT BECAUSE YOU WANT 
TO GET EVEN WITH YOUR MOTHER?

273
00:10:52,777 --> 00:10:54,820
- THIS ISN'T ABOUT MY MOTHER.

274
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:55,821
BESIDES, IT'S THE ONLY WAY

275
00:10:55,821 --> 00:10:57,156
I'M EVER GONNA GET HER 
TO RESPECT ME.

276
00:10:57,156 --> 00:11:01,535
- BUSTER, THIS IS EXACTLY WHY 
OUR RELATIONSHIP DOES NOT WORK.

277
00:11:01,535 --> 00:11:02,828
- OUR RELATIONSHIP DOESN'T WORK?

278
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:04,121
- NO, NOT AS LONG 
AS YOU KEEP GETTING ME

279
00:11:04,121 --> 00:11:05,414
ALL MIXED UP WITH YOUR MOTHER.

280
00:11:05,414 --> 00:11:07,875
- IT IS EXACTLY THE OPPOSITE.

281
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:10,335
I'M LEAVING 
MY MOTHER FOR YOU.

282
00:11:10,335 --> 00:11:13,172
YOU'RE REPLACING 
MY MOTHER.

283
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:15,299
- YOU NEED SOME TIME.

284
00:11:15,299 --> 00:11:17,301
- HUH?

285
00:11:19,553 --> 00:11:20,805
[door closes]

286
00:11:36,904 --> 00:11:39,364
narrator: MEANWHILE, MICHAEL WAS 
FOLLOWING MARTA TO CONFIRM

287
00:11:39,364 --> 00:11:42,117
GOB'S SUSPICIONS 
ABOUT HER AFFAIR.

288
00:11:42,117 --> 00:11:46,121
FIRST, HE SAW HER BUY A PRESENT 
AT AN EXCLUSIVE MEN'S STORE.

289
00:11:46,121 --> 00:11:47,581
THE TRAIL THEN LED MICHAEL

290
00:11:47,581 --> 00:11:50,709
TO THE SET OF MARTA'S 
SPANISH-LANGUAGE SOAP OPERA.

291
00:11:50,709 --> 00:11:52,753
- EXCUSE ME. 
I'M LOOKING FOR "HERMANO."

292
00:11:52,753 --> 00:11:53,754
- OH, MI HERMANO.

293
00:11:55,672 --> 00:11:56,673
- THERE, IN THE GREEN?

294
00:11:56,673 --> 00:11:59,509
- MM-HMM. 
- GREAT, THANKS, GRACIAS.

295
00:11:59,509 --> 00:12:01,511
- [speaking Spanish]

296
00:12:01,511 --> 00:12:03,138
- "HERMANO."

297
00:12:03,138 --> 00:12:04,306
ARE YOU "HERMANO"?

298
00:12:04,306 --> 00:12:05,432
- AH, MI HERMANO?

299
00:12:07,726 --> 00:12:12,356
- THAT'S THE GUY WHO JUST-- 
- MM-HMM.

300
00:12:12,356 --> 00:12:13,983
- SON OF A BITCH.

301
00:12:18,737 --> 00:12:20,155
- [speaking Spanish]

302
00:12:24,201 --> 00:12:26,245
- MARTA.

303
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:33,710
- I HAD TO SEE YOU. 
HE MOVED OUT.

304
00:12:33,710 --> 00:12:35,337
- MOVED OUT? 
BUSTER DID?

305
00:12:35,337 --> 00:12:37,714
- I KNOW IT'S FOR HIS OWN GOOD, 
BUT I'M WORRIED.

306
00:12:37,714 --> 00:12:38,966
- WELL, HE'S GONNA BE FINE.

307
00:12:38,966 --> 00:12:41,551
- I'M NOT WORRIED ABOUT HIM.

308
00:12:41,551 --> 00:12:44,429
I'VE NEVER LIVED 
IN THE APARTMENT ALONE.

309
00:12:44,429 --> 00:12:45,722
I'M NOT SURE I'M UP TO THIS.

310
00:12:45,722 --> 00:12:46,723
- ALL RIGHT. 
SHH, SHH, SHH.

311
00:12:46,723 --> 00:12:49,768
LISTEN, I KNOW YOU THINK 
I'M GOING AFTER THE $49,

312
00:12:49,768 --> 00:12:50,811
BUT I WANT--

313
00:12:50,811 --> 00:12:53,814
I WANT YOU TO WATCH 
A LITTLE "CAGED WISDOM."

314
00:12:53,814 --> 00:12:55,190
- NOT THIS GARBAGE AGAIN.

315
00:12:55,190 --> 00:12:57,734
- THERE IS JOY 
IN SOLITUDE, LUCILLE.

316
00:12:57,734 --> 00:12:59,694
TRY BEING ALONE.

317
00:12:59,694 --> 00:13:01,864
I-I-IT JUST MIGHT 
MAKE YOU HAPPIER.

318
00:13:01,864 --> 00:13:04,616
HONEY, MY HAPPIEST TIMES HERE 
ARE ALONE.

319
00:13:04,616 --> 00:13:06,410
- [sighs]

320
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:09,121
- HEY, BRUNO, ANY CHANCE 
THAT THE HOLE IS AVAILABLE

321
00:13:09,121 --> 00:13:11,623
BETWEEN 4:00 AND 6:00?

322
00:13:11,623 --> 00:13:13,708
- I DON'T EVEN WANT TO KNOW 
WHAT THAT MEANS.

323
00:13:13,708 --> 00:13:14,877
narrator: WITH NOWHERE ELSE 
TO GO,

324
00:13:14,877 --> 00:13:16,837
BUSTER ARRIVED 
AT THE MODEL HOME.

325
00:13:16,837 --> 00:13:19,548
- BUSTER BLUTH. 
- HEY, BROTHER-IN-LAW.

326
00:13:19,548 --> 00:13:22,927
- GOOD NEWS. 
CARL GOT ME AN AUDITION.

327
00:13:22,927 --> 00:13:23,928
- CARL WEATHERS?

328
00:13:23,928 --> 00:13:26,013
- I THINK THE WORLD 
IS ABOUT TO FALL IN LOVE

329
00:13:26,013 --> 00:13:29,474
WITH "FRIGHTENED INMATE \#2."

330
00:13:29,474 --> 00:13:30,976
- WELL, AT LEAST HE GAVE 
YOU SOMETHING.

331
00:13:30,976 --> 00:13:32,811
CARL WEATHERS 
TOOK EVERYTHING FROM ME.

332
00:13:32,811 --> 00:13:34,354
MY ENTIRE LIFE 
JUST CAME CRASHING DOWN,

333
00:13:34,354 --> 00:13:35,689
AND IT'S ALL HIS FAULT.

334
00:13:35,689 --> 00:13:38,483
I WILL NEVER LOVE AGAIN.

335
00:13:38,483 --> 00:13:41,278
- HELLO. 
- OH, MY GOD.

336
00:13:41,278 --> 00:13:42,696
- IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

337
00:13:42,696 --> 00:13:44,865
narrator: AND SUDDENLY, 
BUSTER REALIZED MARTA

338
00:13:44,865 --> 00:13:47,409
WAS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL WOMAN 
HE HAD EVER SEEN.

339
00:13:47,409 --> 00:13:49,369
- I'VE BEEN DATING AN OLD LADY.

340
00:13:49,369 --> 00:13:51,163
- IS MICHAEL HERE?

341
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:52,706
- I-I DON'T-- 
I DON'T KNOW WHERE HE IS.

342
00:13:52,706 --> 00:13:54,666
narrator: IN FACT, 
MICHAEL WAS JUST RETURNING

343
00:13:54,666 --> 00:13:56,293
FROM HIS DAY OF FOLLOWING MARTA.

344
00:13:56,293 --> 00:13:58,879
- WELL, I LOST HER.

345
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:01,131
- MICHAEL. 
- MARTA.

346
00:14:01,131 --> 00:14:03,884
- I'M SO GLAD I CAUGHT YOU. 
- YOU CAUGHT ME?

347
00:14:03,884 --> 00:14:05,552
- YES. 
- OH.

348
00:14:05,552 --> 00:14:09,306
- FIRST OF ALL, THANK YOU 
SO MUCH FOR THE LOVELY PARTY

349
00:14:09,306 --> 00:14:12,059
AND FOR MAKING ME FEEL 
SO WELCOME IN YOUR FAMILY.

350
00:14:12,059 --> 00:14:15,479
- YEAH, SURE. 
- WE LOVE YOU!

351
00:14:15,479 --> 00:14:17,231
CAN I--CAN I STAY HERE 
FOR A LITTLE WHILE?

352
00:14:17,231 --> 00:14:18,440
- WELL, EVERYBODY'S ALREADY

353
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:20,317
SHARING A BEDROOM 
BUT ME, BUSTER.

354
00:14:20,317 --> 00:14:23,070
- OH, PERFECT.

355
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:27,032
- SO, I WAS HOPING YOU MIGHT 
HAVE SOME TIME TO TALK.

356
00:14:27,032 --> 00:14:28,033
THERE'S SOMETHING I NEED--

357
00:14:28,033 --> 00:14:29,826
[cell phone ringing]

358
00:14:29,826 --> 00:14:31,370
MAYBE WE COULD HAVE DINNER?

359
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:32,412
- HELLO?

360
00:14:32,412 --> 00:14:36,541
- SHE'S AT THE HOUSE. 
SHE'S AT THE HOUSE!

361
00:14:36,541 --> 00:14:37,584
- ONE SECOND.

362
00:14:37,584 --> 00:14:40,295
- I'M GONNA SPEAK VERY CAREFULLY 
IN CASE SHE'S WITH YOU.

363
00:14:40,295 --> 00:14:42,422
- YOU'RE RIGHT. 
- RIGHT ABOUT WHAT--SHE'S THERE?

364
00:14:42,422 --> 00:14:44,341
WHAT'S GOING ON? 
WHO'S WITH YOU?

365
00:14:44,341 --> 00:14:45,885
IF IT'S MARTA, SAY "NOBODY." 
- NOBODY.

366
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:47,469
- WELL, NOW I DON'T KNOW 
WHAT'S GOING ON.

367
00:14:47,469 --> 00:14:49,721
[sighs] 
SO, DID YOU FIND OUT ANYTHING?

368
00:14:49,721 --> 00:14:51,015
I-I'M DYING HERE, MICHAEL.

369
00:14:51,015 --> 00:14:52,724
D-DID YOU FIND THAT GUY? 
WHAT'S HIS NAME?

370
00:14:52,724 --> 00:14:53,850
- [whispering] "HERMANO."

371
00:14:53,850 --> 00:14:55,560
- "HERMANO." 
- IS THAT YOUR BROTHER?

372
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:57,897
- HMM? 
NO, HE'S UPSTAIRS, REMEMBER?

373
00:14:57,897 --> 00:14:59,189
LISTEN, I GOT TO GO.

374
00:14:59,189 --> 00:15:01,066
SOMEBODY WANTS TO 
TAKE ME OUT TO DINNER.

375
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:03,318
- SOMEBODY? 
- NOBODY.

376
00:15:03,318 --> 00:15:04,904
- WHY DON'T I JUST COME IN? 
I'M RIGHT OUTSIDE.

377
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:06,863
- NO, NO. 
NOT--NOT A GOOD IDEA.

378
00:15:06,863 --> 00:15:09,366
SOMEBODY WANTS TO TALK TO ME 
ABOUT SOMETHING.

379
00:15:09,366 --> 00:15:12,036
- AH, SHE WANTS 
TO TALK TO YOU--GOT IT.

380
00:15:12,036 --> 00:15:14,538
FOR SOME REASON 
WOMEN FEEL SAFE AROUND YOU.

381
00:15:14,538 --> 00:15:16,331
MAYBE BECAUSE YOU'VE ONLY 
HAD SEX FOUR TIMES.

382
00:15:16,331 --> 00:15:17,917
- NO, FOUR WOMEN! 
NOT FOUR TIMES!

383
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:19,584
AND THEY TALK TO ME 
BECAUSE I TALK TO THEM.

384
00:15:19,584 --> 00:15:21,211
- LOOK, GO TO DINNER.

385
00:15:21,211 --> 00:15:23,923
LET'S GET TO THE BOTTOM OF THIS 
"HERMANO" STUFF, BROTHER.

386
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:27,301
- YEP, GREAT. 
- GREAT.

387
00:15:27,301 --> 00:15:30,387
- HEY, ABOUT DINNER. 
I'D LOVE TO.

388
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:34,891
narrator: 
TOBIAS ARRIVED AT HIS AUDITION

389
00:15:34,891 --> 00:15:37,894
FOR "FRIGHTENED INMATE \#2."

390
00:15:37,894 --> 00:15:40,439
[chattering]

391
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:42,482
THE COMPETITION 
FRIGHTENED TOBIAS,

392
00:15:42,482 --> 00:15:44,944
WHICH HE FELT HE COULD 
USE IN HIS PERFORMANCE.

393
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:47,237
UNFORTUNATELY, 
THIS MADE HIM MORE CONFIDENT,

394
00:15:47,237 --> 00:15:50,115
WHICH FRIGHTENED HIM AGAIN.

395
00:15:50,115 --> 00:15:51,408
- I'M READY.

396
00:15:51,408 --> 00:15:54,328
narrator: THAT NIGHT, MAEBY 
MOVED IN TO LINDSAY'S ROOM.

397
00:15:54,328 --> 00:15:57,957
- ISN'T THIS FUN? 
IT'S LIKE A SLUMBER PARTY.

398
00:15:57,957 --> 00:16:01,585
OOH.

399
00:16:01,585 --> 00:16:02,877
- THAT'S IT!

400
00:16:02,877 --> 00:16:04,129
TELL ME WHAT'S UP 
WITH YOU AND DAD.

401
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:05,130
- NOTHING.

402
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:06,631
NOTHING'S WRONG 
WITH YOUR FATHER AND ME.

403
00:16:06,631 --> 00:16:10,010
WE HAVE A--A WONDERFUL, 
CLOSE RELATIONSHIP.

404
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:12,972
AND CAN I LET YOU IN 
ON A LITTLE SECRET, HMM?

405
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:17,101
HAVING HIM IN THE NEXT ROOM 
MAKES ME MISS HIM ALL THE MORE.

406
00:16:17,101 --> 00:16:18,393
- MOM, PLEASE.

407
00:16:18,393 --> 00:16:21,480
HE'S GOT A BIG-BOY CRUSH 
ON ACTION JACKSON.

408
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:24,358
- I KNOW. 
HOW CAN I COMPETE WITH THAT?

409
00:16:24,358 --> 00:16:28,403
OKAY, WE'RE HAVING 
A LITTLE FIGHT RIGHT NOW.

410
00:16:28,403 --> 00:16:30,655
BUT DON'T WORRY, DARLING. 
OKAY?

411
00:16:30,655 --> 00:16:33,867
MOMMY AND DADDY 
AREN'T GOING ANYWHERE.

412
00:16:33,867 --> 00:16:35,160
- OKAY.

413
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,870
I'M GONNA GO 
UNPACK MY SUITCASE.

414
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:39,831
- NO! 
WE MAY HAVE TO BOLT.

415
00:16:39,831 --> 00:16:42,417
narrator: TOBIAS MOVED IN 
TO GEORGE MICHAEL'S ROOM.

416
00:16:42,417 --> 00:16:43,793
- YOU KNOW, MAEBY AND I 
WERE COOL WITH EACH OTHER.

417
00:16:43,793 --> 00:16:45,254
AND I MEAN, YOU MUST REALLY 
MISS YOUR WIFE.

418
00:16:45,254 --> 00:16:47,089
IT'S PRACTICALLY STILL 
YOUR ANNIVERSARY.

419
00:16:47,089 --> 00:16:49,424
- 14 YEARS OF LIES.

420
00:16:49,424 --> 00:16:52,677
YES, I'M THE DOCTOR. 
THE PERFECT HUSBAND.

421
00:16:52,677 --> 00:16:55,639
THE BIG MANLY MAN. 
THE BIG STRONG DADDY.

422
00:16:55,639 --> 00:16:58,975
DO YOU KNOW THE LAST TIME 
THAT I MADE LOVE TO MY WIFE?

423
00:16:58,975 --> 00:17:00,310
- NO. 
- I'LL TELL YOU WHEN.

424
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:01,311
- NO, DON'T.

425
00:17:01,311 --> 00:17:03,313
- SEE, NOTHING HAS EVER 
BEEN EASY FOR US.

426
00:17:03,313 --> 00:17:05,024
I MEAN, THE ONLY REASON 
SHE WENT OUT WITH ME

427
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:06,108
WAS TO PISS OFF HER BOYFRIEND.

428
00:17:06,108 --> 00:17:08,027
THE ONLY REASON 
SHE EVER MARRIED ME

429
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:09,778
WAS TO PISS OFF HER MOTHER.

430
00:17:09,778 --> 00:17:11,280
AND THEN, OF COURSE, 
WE COULDN'T CONCEIVE.

431
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,323
SO THERE WAS THAT FAMOUS ORDEAL.

432
00:17:13,323 --> 00:17:15,242
- WH-WHAT DO YOU MEAN YOU 
COULDN'T CONCEIVE?

433
00:17:15,242 --> 00:17:16,243
WAS MAEBY ADOPTED?

434
00:17:16,243 --> 00:17:17,244
[cell phone ringing]

435
00:17:17,244 --> 00:17:18,245
WHAT, IS SHE NOT 
REALLY RELATED TO ME?

436
00:17:18,245 --> 00:17:19,413
IS SHE JUST SOME GIRL I KNOW?

437
00:17:19,413 --> 00:17:22,041
- [whispering] 
AH, IT'S CARL WEATHERS.

438
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:24,751
YES, CARL WEATHERS.

439
00:17:24,751 --> 00:17:27,962
I DID? 
THAT'S--THAT'S WONDERFUL.

440
00:17:27,962 --> 00:17:29,714
- THAT'S--

441
00:17:29,714 --> 00:17:30,715
[phone beeps]

442
00:17:30,715 --> 00:17:31,716
HUH! I BOOKED IT!

443
00:17:31,716 --> 00:17:33,093
I BOOKED THE ACTING JOB!

444
00:17:33,093 --> 00:17:34,344
DID YOU HEAR THAT, LINDSAY?

445
00:17:34,344 --> 00:17:37,514
YOU COULD HAVE BEEN SLEEPING 
WITH "FRIGHTENED INMATE \#2."

446
00:17:40,225 --> 00:17:41,851
narrator: 
AND LUCILLE WAS EXPERIENCING

447
00:17:41,851 --> 00:17:45,814
BEING ALONE FOR THE FIRST TIME.

448
00:17:45,814 --> 00:17:48,692
UNABLE TO SLEEP, 
SHE DECIDED TO WATCH TV.

449
00:17:48,692 --> 00:17:51,861
- YOU HAVE GOT 
TO LEARN TO BE ALONE.

450
00:17:51,861 --> 00:17:54,406
narrator: THEN SHE REMEMBERED 
THAT WITH NO ONE TO DISTURB,

451
00:17:54,406 --> 00:17:56,866
SHE COULD TURN UP THE VOLUME 
AS LOUD AS SHE WANTED.

452
00:17:56,866 --> 00:17:58,702
- "CAGED WISDOM" TEACHES YOU

453
00:17:58,702 --> 00:18:02,081
THAT YOU HAVE 
TO FIND THE JOY WITHIN YOURSELF.

454
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:04,208
- [singing from radio] 
SHH, HERE COMES MAMA

455
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:05,209
MAMA'S TALKIN' LOUD

456
00:18:05,209 --> 00:18:06,501
narrator: 
AND THAT'S WHEN LUCILLE REALIZED

457
00:18:06,501 --> 00:18:09,796
THAT SHE JUST MIGHT LIKE 
BEING ALONE AFTER ALL.

458
00:18:09,796 --> 00:18:14,218
- [singing] MAMA'S LETTIN' LOOSE

459
00:18:14,218 --> 00:18:15,885
narrator: THE NEXT NIGHT, 
MICHAEL HAD DINNER

460
00:18:15,885 --> 00:18:17,554
WITH MARTA AT HER HOUSE,

461
00:18:17,554 --> 00:18:20,640
HOPING TO FINALLY GET 
THE ANSWERS HE WAS LOOKING FOR.

462
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:24,978
- SO, UM, ABOUT GOB. 
HOW'S THAT GOIN'?

463
00:18:24,978 --> 00:18:27,147
- WELL, AS YOU SAID,

464
00:18:27,147 --> 00:18:30,234
FINDING OUT WHO YOU REALLY ARE, 
IT CAN BE PAINFUL.

465
00:18:30,234 --> 00:18:33,027
BUT YOU CAN'T LIVE A LIE. 
- NO, I CAN'T.

466
00:18:33,027 --> 00:18:35,489
BUT SOME PEOPLE FIND A WAY 
TO MAKE THAT WORK.

467
00:18:35,489 --> 00:18:38,825
- YES, BUT SOMETIMES 
WORKING AT SOMETHING,

468
00:18:38,825 --> 00:18:41,745
IT'S A WAY TO NOT DEAL 
WITH SOME OTHER THING.

469
00:18:41,745 --> 00:18:45,457
- BUT HE WHO OFTEN SUGGESTS,

470
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:47,292
UH, WORKING ON ANOTHER THING,

471
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:49,419
WHICH, WHEN 
THE FIRST THING IS NOT--

472
00:18:49,419 --> 00:18:50,587
- WILL YOU EXCUSE ME 
FOR A MOMENT?

473
00:18:50,587 --> 00:18:53,965
- YES. 
SURE.

474
00:18:53,965 --> 00:18:54,966
- WHAT THE HELL 
IS HE TALKING ABOUT?

475
00:18:54,966 --> 00:18:57,051
- THE HELL IS SHE TALKING ABOUT?

476
00:18:57,051 --> 00:18:58,428
- CAN I HAVE A PIECE OF CAKE?

477
00:18:58,428 --> 00:18:59,929
narrator: AND MICHAEL 
SAW AN OPPORTUNITY

478
00:18:59,929 --> 00:19:02,307
TO GET THE INFORMATION 
HE WASN'T GETTING FROM MARTA

479
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:03,350
FROM HER SON.

480
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:04,351
- I'LL TELL YOU WHAT.

481
00:19:04,351 --> 00:19:07,437
I GOT--I GOT A DEAL 
FOR YOU, PARTNER.

482
00:19:07,437 --> 00:19:10,190
I'LL GIVE YOU WHAT YOU WANT

483
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:12,859
IF YOU GIVE ME WHAT I WANT.

484
00:19:12,859 --> 00:19:17,156
TELL ME EVERYTHING 
YOU KNOW ABOUT "HERMANO."

485
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:18,407
- HERMANO?

486
00:19:18,407 --> 00:19:20,033
- DOES YOUR MOTHER 
LOVE "HERMANO?"

487
00:19:20,033 --> 00:19:22,577
- SI, MI HERMANO.

488
00:19:22,577 --> 00:19:25,872
- HE'S HERE? 
- SHH, HE'S SLEEPING.

489
00:19:28,082 --> 00:19:29,793
- DON'T GO IN THERE.

490
00:19:29,793 --> 00:19:31,545
- WHY, IS THERE SOMETHING 
YOU DON'T WANT ME TO SEE?

491
00:19:31,545 --> 00:19:32,629
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

492
00:19:32,629 --> 00:19:34,047
- YOU KNOW, WE CAN 
KEEP GOING AROUND IN CIRCLES,

493
00:19:34,047 --> 00:19:35,674
BUT MAYBE ONE OF US 
SHOULD JUST COME OUT AND SAY

494
00:19:35,674 --> 00:19:37,426
WHAT IT IS WE WANT TO SAY.

495
00:19:37,426 --> 00:19:39,844
- YOU'RE RIGHT.

496
00:19:39,844 --> 00:19:43,097
IT'S NOT WORKING WITH GOB. 
- WHY DOESN'T HE KNOW THAT?

497
00:19:43,097 --> 00:19:44,808
YOU KNOW YOU COULD HAVE 
JUST COME OUT AND TOLD HIM,

498
00:19:44,808 --> 00:19:47,101
YOU KNOW, INSTEAD OF LYING 
AND SNEAKING AROUND,

499
00:19:47,101 --> 00:19:48,102
MOVING ON TO THE NEXT GUY.

500
00:19:48,102 --> 00:19:49,688
I DIDN'T THINK YOU WERE 
THAT KIND OF A PERSON.

501
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:51,981
YOU KNOW, I THOUGHT YOU AND I 
SHARED THE SAME VALUES.

502
00:19:51,981 --> 00:19:56,653
I THOUGHT YOU AND I 
COULD'VE BEEN, UH--

503
00:19:56,653 --> 00:19:58,405
NO, FORGET IT.

504
00:19:58,405 --> 00:20:00,699
I DON'T KNOW 
HOW I HAD YOU SO WRONG.

505
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:03,159
- YOU'RE RIGHT.

506
00:20:03,159 --> 00:20:07,789
I SHOULD HAVE TOLD HIM 
BEFORE I INVITED YOU HERE.

507
00:20:07,789 --> 00:20:10,792
THIS CAN NEVER BE.

508
00:20:13,295 --> 00:20:17,257
narrator: THEN HE NOTICED 
THE GIFT HE HAD SEEN HER BUY.

509
00:20:28,184 --> 00:20:29,603
- [sighs]

510
00:20:29,603 --> 00:20:31,438
WHAT DOES "TE AMO" MEAN?

511
00:20:31,438 --> 00:20:35,692
- I LOVE YOU. 
- HMM.

512
00:20:35,692 --> 00:20:37,694
AND WHO'S IN THERE?

513
00:20:41,155 --> 00:20:43,617
- MI HERMANO.

514
00:20:43,617 --> 00:20:46,745
- BROTHER.

515
00:20:46,745 --> 00:20:49,914
I'VE MADE A HUGE MISTAKE.

516
00:20:49,914 --> 00:20:52,251
narrator: ON THE NEXT 
"ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT."

517
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:55,086
GEORGE MICHAEL 
BEGINS AN INVESTIGATION.

518
00:20:55,086 --> 00:20:57,256
- SO, YOU WANT TO GO 
TO THE MOVIES?

519
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:58,382
OW!

520
00:20:58,382 --> 00:20:59,883
- I'LL LET YOU KNOW 
WHEN I GET BACK FROM THE LAB.

521
00:20:59,883 --> 00:21:02,469
narrator: TOBIAS FACES 
HIS GREATEST ACTING CHALLENGE.

522
00:21:02,469 --> 00:21:05,264
- THERE'S A SHOWER SCENE? 
I HAVE TO BE NUDE?

523
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:06,765
- WELL, YOU DON'T SHOWER 
WITH YOUR CLOTHES ON,

524
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:09,225
NOW, DO YOU?

525
00:21:09,225 --> 00:21:12,103
narrator: AND BUSTER REBOUNDS 
FROM LUCILLE 2.

526
00:21:12,103 --> 00:21:15,106
- YO TE QUIERO MUCHO. 
- YO TE QUIERO MUCHO.

527
00:21:15,106 --> 00:21:18,443
TE AMO, MARTA. 
TE AMO.
