00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:02,460
[narrator] 
NOW THE STORY

2
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:04,170
OF A WEALTHY FAMILY 
WHO LOST EVERYTHING...

3
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:05,546
AND THE ONE SON 
WHO HAD NO CHOICE...

4
00:00:05,546 --> 00:00:07,173
BUT TO KEEP THEM ALL TOGETHER.

5
00:00:13,638 --> 00:00:15,640
IT'S ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT.

6
00:00:18,268 --> 00:00:19,935
[narrator] 
MICHAEL BLUTH

7
00:00:19,935 --> 00:00:22,772
WAS WORKING AT HOME WHEN 
HE NOTICED SOMETHING UNUSUAL.

8
00:00:22,772 --> 00:00:24,732
[rattling]

9
00:00:26,651 --> 00:00:28,653
- THAT CAN'T BE GOOD.

10
00:00:28,653 --> 00:00:31,697
- OKAY, I CHECKED UNDERNEATH, 
AND THERE IS A PROBLEM.

11
00:00:31,697 --> 00:00:33,491
YOU KNOW THIS ISN'T 
A REAL HOUSE?

12
00:00:33,491 --> 00:00:35,035
- IT'S A MODEL HOUSE.

13
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:36,661
- WELL, THE DRAIN PIPES 
AREN'T HOOKED UP.

14
00:00:36,661 --> 00:00:38,246
JUST EMPTY UNDER THE HOUSE.

15
00:00:38,246 --> 00:00:40,206
PLUS, THERE'S A LOT OF 
BLUE PAINT DOWN THERE.

16
00:00:40,206 --> 00:00:41,249
- AND SOME PIECES OF DENIM?

17
00:00:41,249 --> 00:00:42,542
- YEAH.

18
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:44,043
- WE'VE GOT A GUY 
LIKE THAT HERE.

19
00:00:44,043 --> 00:00:45,878
- WELL, THAT'S WHY YOUR 
LIVING ROOM IS SINKING.

20
00:00:45,878 --> 00:00:48,673
AND I THINK THE CITY'S 
GONNA HAVE TO RED-TAG IT.

21
00:00:48,673 --> 00:00:50,550
- THE CITY IS SENDING OUT 
AN INSPECTOR.

22
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:52,760
THEY'RE GONNA BE CRAWLING OVER 
EVERY INCH OF THIS PLACE.

23
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:54,095
YOU'RE GOING TO NEED TO LEAVE.

24
00:00:54,095 --> 00:00:55,471
- WHERE THE HELL 
DO YOU WANT ME TO GO?

25
00:00:55,471 --> 00:00:57,348
BACK TO YOUR MOTHER'S?

26
00:00:57,348 --> 00:01:00,060
I BELIEVE THERE'S 
A FREELOADING LOSER IN MY BED.

27
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:02,103
- BUSTER JUST LOST A HAND. 
HE'S GOING THROUGH A LOT.

28
00:01:02,103 --> 00:01:03,813
- I'M TALKING ABOUT OSCAR.

29
00:01:03,813 --> 00:01:05,273
- OH, YES. 
YOUR BROTHER.

30
00:01:05,273 --> 00:01:06,691
I CAN SEE WHY 
THAT WOULD BUG YOU.

31
00:01:06,691 --> 00:01:08,526
[narrator] 
IN FACT, OSCAR HAD

32
00:01:08,526 --> 00:01:11,529
STAYED WITH LUCILLE PRIMARILY 
TO RECONNECT WITH BUSTER,

33
00:01:11,529 --> 00:01:13,614
WHOM HE SECRETLY BELIEVED 
TO BE HIS NATURAL SON.

34
00:01:13,614 --> 00:01:15,783
- HEY, UNCLE.

35
00:01:15,783 --> 00:01:17,243
I FEEL SO RESPONSIBLE 
FOR THAT.

36
00:01:17,243 --> 00:01:18,828
[narrator] 
OSCAR HAD GOTTEN INJURED

37
00:01:18,828 --> 00:01:21,038
ON A SHODDY DEVICE 
GEORGE SR. HAD INVENTED...

38
00:01:21,038 --> 00:01:23,291
WHEN HE FORGOT BUSTER 
WAS WEARING A PROSTHETIC HAND.

39
00:01:23,291 --> 00:01:24,917
- BUSTER! 
THE CORNBALLER!

40
00:01:24,917 --> 00:01:27,378
[both screaming] 
[sizzling]

41
00:01:27,378 --> 00:01:29,255
- IT'S MY FATHER'S FAULT! 
- MY FAULT?

42
00:01:29,255 --> 00:01:31,466
I WAS TRYING TO KEEP YOU 
FROM BURNING YOURSELF,

43
00:01:31,466 --> 00:01:32,717
YOU IDIOT!

44
00:01:32,717 --> 00:01:34,427
I MEAN, YES, YES.

45
00:01:34,427 --> 00:01:36,554
GEORGE SR. 
SURE RUSHED THIS TO MARKET.

46
00:01:36,554 --> 00:01:39,265
- THE ONLY REASON SHE LIKES HIM 
IS HE HAS HAIR.

47
00:01:39,265 --> 00:01:41,016
AND THE ONLY REASON 
HE HAS ANY IS BECAUSE

48
00:01:41,016 --> 00:01:42,477
HE'S NEVER HAD ANY STRESS.

49
00:01:42,477 --> 00:01:43,728
- YEAH?

50
00:01:43,728 --> 00:01:45,396
WELL, YOU COULD SAVE ME 
A LOT OF STRESS

51
00:01:45,396 --> 00:01:46,689
IF YOU JUST TURNED YOURSELF IN.

52
00:01:46,689 --> 00:01:48,608
- NO, NEVER.

53
00:01:48,608 --> 00:01:50,943
I CAN'T GO BACK TO THE JOINT. 
NO, I CANNOT GO BACK THERE.

54
00:01:50,943 --> 00:01:53,821
[singing] 
WHAT COULD BE BETTER

55
00:01:53,821 --> 00:01:58,118
- HEY, MAN! 
- TO HOLD THINGS TOGETHER

56
00:01:58,118 --> 00:02:00,661
- YEAH!

57
00:02:00,661 --> 00:02:02,830
[singing] 
SO GOOD TO COME CLEAN

58
00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:04,415
- IT'S A HELL-HOLE.

59
00:02:04,415 --> 00:02:06,667
- I FINALLY GOT THE COURT 
TO TRY YOU IN ABSENTIA.

60
00:02:06,667 --> 00:02:09,129
WHICH MEANS WE'RE NOT SUPPOSED 
TO HAVE ANY IDEA WHERE YOU ARE.

61
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:10,630
SO YOU DON'T 
HAVE TO GO TO PRISON,

62
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:12,715
BUT YOU CAN'T STAY HERE.

63
00:02:12,715 --> 00:02:15,050
- REMEMBER THAT FRENCH MOVIE 
WE TRIED TO SNEAK INTO ONCE--

64
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:17,178
DANGEROUS COUSINS?

65
00:02:17,178 --> 00:02:19,472
- NO, I-- WHY? DID WE--

66
00:02:19,472 --> 00:02:23,017
[stammering] 
I DON'T REMEMBER THAT, NO.

67
00:02:23,017 --> 00:02:24,310
[narrator] 
GEORGE MICHAEL

68
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:25,811
REMEMBERED VERY WELL.

69
00:02:25,811 --> 00:02:27,605
IN FACT, HE CURRENTLY 
HAD A COPY OF THE DVD

70
00:02:27,605 --> 00:02:29,982
HIDDEN IN HIS SOCK DRAWER.

71
00:02:29,982 --> 00:02:31,859
- KIND OF.

72
00:02:31,859 --> 00:02:33,986
WHY DO YOU ASK?

73
00:02:33,986 --> 00:02:36,113
- I GOT PASSES TO THE PREMIERE 
OF THE AMERICAN REMAKE.

74
00:02:36,113 --> 00:02:37,365
SUPPOSED TO BE GREAT.

75
00:02:37,365 --> 00:02:38,533
[narrator] 
IT WASN'T GREAT,

76
00:02:38,533 --> 00:02:40,160
AND MAEBY KNEW IT.

77
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,119
THE STUDIO AT WHICH SHE'D 
FINAGLED A JOB HAD HOPED

78
00:02:42,119 --> 00:02:44,789
TO AVOID CONTROVERSY...

79
00:02:44,789 --> 00:02:46,707
BY ARTLESSLY EXPLAINING 
THAT THE TWO LEADS

80
00:02:46,707 --> 00:02:48,543
WEREN'T BIOLOGICAL COUSINS.

81
00:02:48,543 --> 00:02:50,336
[woman on film] 
SHUT UP AND KISS ME!

82
00:02:52,171 --> 00:02:54,215
- WHERE IS EVERYBODY? 
- THEY'VE BEEN FIRED.

83
00:02:54,215 --> 00:02:57,218
AND YOU GOTTA FIX THIS, 
OR YOU'RE GONNA BE FIRED TOO.

84
00:02:57,218 --> 00:02:58,469
CUT IT DOWN 
IF YOU HAVE TO.

85
00:02:58,469 --> 00:03:00,680
- BUT IT'S ONLY 71 MINUTES LONG.

86
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,139
AND IT'S ONLY, 
LIKE, 63 MINUTES LONG.

87
00:03:02,139 --> 00:03:03,808
SO BRING ANN.

88
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:06,101
- NO, THAT'S NOT 
HER KIND OF THING.

89
00:03:06,101 --> 00:03:08,313
I MEAN, IF IT MAINTAINS 
ANY OF THE COMPLEX EROTICISM

90
00:03:08,313 --> 00:03:10,523
OF THE FRENCH ORIGINAL ANYWAY.

91
00:03:10,523 --> 00:03:12,775
I LIKE THE WAY THEY THINK.

92
00:03:12,775 --> 00:03:14,444
[narrator] 
AND LATER, AT THE OFFICE,

93
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:15,778
MICHAEL HAD ANOTHER SURPRISE.

94
00:03:15,778 --> 00:03:17,613
- THIS CAN'T BE GOOD.

95
00:03:17,613 --> 00:03:20,533
- "MICHAEL, IT SADDENS ME 
GREATLY TO SAY TO YOU...

96
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:23,453
"THAT I CAN NO LONGER WORK 
AT THE BLUTH COMPANY.

97
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:24,954
YOU'VE BEEN A GREAT BOSS"--

98
00:03:24,954 --> 00:03:26,414
- I'M SORRY, TOBIAS. 
DO YOU WORK HERE?

99
00:03:26,414 --> 00:03:28,291
- DO I WORK--

100
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:31,001
I DEVELOPED AN EATING DISORDER 
BEING YOUR ASSISTANT, MICHAEL.

101
00:03:31,001 --> 00:03:33,045
- I NEVER SAW YOU AT THE DESK.

102
00:03:33,045 --> 00:03:34,922
- WELL, EXCUSE ME 
IF I WAS TOO BUSY ON MY KNEES

103
00:03:34,922 --> 00:03:36,882
IN FRONT OF THE TOILET, MICHAEL.

104
00:03:36,882 --> 00:03:38,468
"I HAVE A TREMENDOUS 
OPPORTUNITY...

105
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:39,927
"NOW THAT THE BLUE MAN GROUP

106
00:03:39,927 --> 00:03:41,679
"HAS DROPPED THEIR 
CEASE-AND-DESIST...

107
00:03:41,679 --> 00:03:43,723
"AND INVITED ME TO AUDITION 
IN LAS VEGAS.

108
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:45,683
ALSO, I'VE DEVELOPED 
SOME ISSUES WITH FOOD"--

109
00:03:45,683 --> 00:03:47,352
- I'M SORRY TO INTERRUPT 
ONE MORE TIME.

110
00:03:47,352 --> 00:03:49,186
IS THIS THE REAL 
BLUE MAN GROUP THIS TIME?

111
00:03:49,186 --> 00:03:50,896
[narrator] 
TOBIAS HAD RECENTLY BEEN

112
00:03:50,896 --> 00:03:53,023
ASKED TO ADDRESS 
A GROUP OF DEPRESSED MEN...

113
00:03:53,023 --> 00:03:56,777
WHO HAD BEEN DESCRIBED 
OVER THE PHONE AS BLUE.

114
00:04:01,532 --> 00:04:04,369
- I FEEL LIKE 
A-- [bleep] IDIOT.

115
00:04:04,369 --> 00:04:06,078
FORTUNATELY, I FOUND

116
00:04:06,078 --> 00:04:08,205
A WONDERFUL CIRCLE OF MEN 
TO GET ME THROUGH THAT.

117
00:04:08,205 --> 00:04:09,707
OH, BEFORE I FORGET,

118
00:04:09,707 --> 00:04:12,502
YOUR OLD SECRETARY, 
KITTY SANCHEZ, CALLED...

119
00:04:12,502 --> 00:04:14,169
AND WANTED 
TO MEET WITH YOU.

120
00:04:14,169 --> 00:04:15,671
I PENCILED HER IN 
FOR 4:00 TODAY.

121
00:04:15,671 --> 00:04:17,340
- WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME?

122
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:18,924
- OH, THIS IS MY FAULT TOO?

123
00:04:18,924 --> 00:04:20,217
EVERYTHING-- NO.

124
00:04:20,217 --> 00:04:22,553
NO! I WILL NOT LET THIS 
MAKE ME EAT!

125
00:04:22,553 --> 00:04:24,347
[sobbing]

126
00:04:24,347 --> 00:04:25,765
- SO GET THIS.

127
00:04:25,765 --> 00:04:27,267
TOMORROW I GOTTA 
GO ON RECORD AND SAY

128
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:28,893
I DON'T KNOW WHERE DAD IS.

129
00:04:28,893 --> 00:04:30,603
AND NOW KITTY SANCHEZ 
WANTS TO MEET WITH ME.

130
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:32,187
[narrator] 
AND MEETINGS WITH KITTY

131
00:04:32,187 --> 00:04:33,648
HAD NEVER ENDED WELL.

132
00:04:33,648 --> 00:04:35,441
- SAY GOOD-BYE TO THESE. 
- SPRING BREAK! WHOO!

133
00:04:35,441 --> 00:04:36,817
- PERHAPS THIS'LL 
JOG YOUR MEMORY.

134
00:04:36,817 --> 00:04:38,403
- [Cal] 
OH! THEY'RE CROOKED!

135
00:04:38,403 --> 00:04:40,280
- PLUS, DAD WILL NOT 
LEAVE THE ATTIC, WHICH MEANS

136
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,947
HE'S GONNA GET CAUGHT,

137
00:04:41,947 --> 00:04:43,866
WHICH MEANS I'M GONNA 
GET CAUGHT FOR HIDING HIM.

138
00:04:43,866 --> 00:04:45,326
- WELL, WHY DON'T YOU 
GET GOB TO DO

139
00:04:45,326 --> 00:04:47,119
YOUR DIRTY WORK FOR YOU?

140
00:04:47,119 --> 00:04:49,246
SHALL I KNOCK DAD OUT AND 
CHAIN HIM TO A PIPE SOMEWHERE?

141
00:04:49,246 --> 00:04:51,374
OR SHOULD I RISK ANOTHER 
HERPES OUTBREAK WITH KITTY?

142
00:04:51,374 --> 00:04:52,833
WHICH IS IT THIS TIME?

143
00:04:52,833 --> 00:04:54,585
- DEFINITELY NOT 
ONE OF THOSE TWO THINGS.

144
00:04:54,585 --> 00:04:56,546
BUT ARE YOU UPSET 
ABOUT SOMETHING, GOB?

145
00:04:56,546 --> 00:04:58,631
- I MADE YOU A THANK-YOU GIFT 
LAST WEEK ABOUT WHICH

146
00:04:58,631 --> 00:05:00,633
YOU HAVEN'T SAID WORD ONE.

147
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:04,345
- COME ON. 
YOU ASKED ME FOR $5,000...

148
00:05:04,345 --> 00:05:06,972
SO THAT YOU COULD INVEST 
IN A FRANKLIN CD.

149
00:05:06,972 --> 00:05:10,100
NOW, I ASSUMED THAT YOU WERE 
TALKING ABOUT THE MUTUAL FUND...

150
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:12,395
AND NOT A COMPACT DISC 
OF YOU SINGING TO YOUR HAND.

151
00:05:12,395 --> 00:05:13,979
[narrator] 
GOB HAD RECENTLY MADE

152
00:05:13,979 --> 00:05:15,523
A RECORDING 
OF HIS VENTRILOQUISM ACT.

153
00:05:15,523 --> 00:05:16,982
- "FRANKLIN COMES ALIVE." 
TAKE ONE.

154
00:05:16,982 --> 00:05:18,734
[narrator] 
HE HOPED IT WOULD

155
00:05:18,734 --> 00:05:20,986
BREAK DOWN RACIAL BARRIERS 
AND MAYBE BE A CROSSOVER HIT.

156
00:05:20,986 --> 00:05:22,363
- [singing] 
IT AIN'T EASY

157
00:05:22,363 --> 00:05:23,864
BEIN' WHITE

158
00:05:23,864 --> 00:05:26,867
IT AIN'T EASY 
BEIN' BROWN

159
00:05:26,867 --> 00:05:30,413
ALL THIS PRESSURE 
TO BE BRIGHT

160
00:05:30,413 --> 00:05:34,083
I GOT CHILDREN 
ALL OVER TOWN

161
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:37,378
SOMETIMES-- 
HEY, WHERE'D THE GUY GO?

162
00:05:37,378 --> 00:05:39,046
I TRIED TO EXPRESS 
SOMETHING TO YOU IN

163
00:05:39,046 --> 00:05:40,673
A COUPLE OF THOSE NUMBERS...

164
00:05:40,673 --> 00:05:43,551
AND MAYBE, JUST MAYBE, 
HEAL THIS COUNTRY A LITTLE BIT.

165
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:46,261
BUT YOU, YOU DIDN'T EVEN 
BOTHER TO LISTEN TO IT.

166
00:05:46,261 --> 00:05:48,138
- I DID LISTEN TO IT.

167
00:05:48,138 --> 00:05:50,933
I-I-I-I AM LISTENING TO IT. 
GOB. HEY.

168
00:05:50,933 --> 00:05:53,018
MAYBE THE REASON 
I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING IS 'CAUSE

169
00:05:53,018 --> 00:05:54,562
I DIDN'T WANT TO EMBARRASS YOU.

170
00:05:54,562 --> 00:05:56,731
IT'S MY FAVORITE, 
FAVORITE RECORD.

171
00:05:56,731 --> 00:05:59,984
- WELL, THEN YOU-- 
YOU-- [bleeps] UP.

172
00:05:59,984 --> 00:06:02,612
[sobbing] 
BECAUSE I AM SO EMBARRASSED.

173
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:05,448
- IT'S A GOOD CD. 
IT'S A REALLY GOOD CD.

174
00:06:05,448 --> 00:06:06,907
- I CAN'T BELIEVE 
THAT YOU LOVE IT.

175
00:06:06,907 --> 00:06:09,243
- I LOVE IT SO MUCH.

176
00:06:09,243 --> 00:06:12,538
- OH, GOD. 
OH, GOD, LOOK AT US.

177
00:06:12,538 --> 00:06:14,999
CRYING LIKE 
A COUPLE OF GIRLS.

178
00:06:14,999 --> 00:06:17,167
- AW, YOU'RE 
THE ONLY ONE CRYING.

179
00:06:17,167 --> 00:06:18,961
BUT I LOVE THE MUSIC.

180
00:06:18,961 --> 00:06:20,463
- AND THE CARD 
WITH YOUR FACE ON IT?

181
00:06:20,463 --> 00:06:21,631
- AND THE HEALING.

182
00:06:21,631 --> 00:06:23,591
- HOME RUN!

183
00:06:25,801 --> 00:06:28,262
WE'LL DO YOUR DIRTY WORK 
FOR YOU, MIKEY.

184
00:06:30,139 --> 00:06:32,141
YOU LEAVE THE ROUGH STUFF 
TO FRANKLIN AND ME.

185
00:06:32,141 --> 00:06:34,101
- NOW I GOTTA LISTEN TO THAT CD.

186
00:06:34,101 --> 00:06:35,895
- HI, DAD. 
- RIGHT.

187
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:38,481
- YOU REMEMBER FRANKLIN.

188
00:06:38,481 --> 00:06:41,150
- HEY, FRANKLIN. 
- MY MAN!

189
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:44,278
HOW 'BOUT SOME TONGUE? 
- WHA-- OH--

190
00:06:44,278 --> 00:06:45,530
[narrator] 
BUT FRANKLIN

191
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:47,239
DIDN'T WANT TO KISS AT ALL.

192
00:06:47,239 --> 00:06:49,534
GOB HAD SOAKED 
THE PUPPET'S MOUTH IN ETHER.

193
00:06:49,534 --> 00:06:51,869
AND DOWNSTAIRS, TOBIAS SHARED 
HIS GOOD NEWS WITH LINDSAY.

194
00:06:51,869 --> 00:06:53,871
[water running]

195
00:06:53,871 --> 00:06:56,248
- "...ONCE IN A LIFETIME."

196
00:06:56,248 --> 00:06:59,293
- TOBIAS, I AM NOT UPROOTING 
MY LIFE AND MOVING TO VEGAS.

197
00:06:59,293 --> 00:07:01,587
MAYBE THIS IS A SIGN THAT 
OUR RELATIONSHIP ISN'T WORKING,

198
00:07:01,587 --> 00:07:02,672
AND WE SHOULD SPLIT AGAIN.

199
00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:03,881
- WAIT A SECOND.

200
00:07:03,881 --> 00:07:05,340
I THOUGHT WE WERE SPLIT UP,

201
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:06,926
AND THIS WOULD 
BRING US BACK TOGETHER.

202
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:08,511
- WELL, MAYBE THE FACT 
THAT WE DON'T KNOW

203
00:07:08,511 --> 00:07:09,887
IF WE'RE TOGETHER OR NOT...

204
00:07:09,887 --> 00:07:12,306
IS A SIGN 
THAT WE SHOULD SPLIT AGAIN.

205
00:07:12,306 --> 00:07:14,016
- OR STAY SPLIT UP.

206
00:07:14,016 --> 00:07:15,726
OKAY, FORGET ABOUT VEGAS.

207
00:07:15,726 --> 00:07:17,853
WE'LL STAY HERE 
AND GET BACK TOGETHER.

208
00:07:17,853 --> 00:07:20,064
OR STAY TOGETHER AND EITHER 
REKINDLE OR FAN THIS FIRE.

209
00:07:20,064 --> 00:07:22,900
[house creaking]

210
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:24,401
[narrator] 
AND SOON, GOB WAS

211
00:07:24,401 --> 00:07:25,611
ON HIS WAY TO DUMP HIS FATHER

212
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:27,321
ON THE POLICE STATION STEPS.

213
00:07:27,321 --> 00:07:29,073
- DO YOU FORGIVE ME?

214
00:07:29,073 --> 00:07:30,450
[narrator] 
AND HE DECIDED TO

215
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:31,617
LET HIMSELF OFF THE HOOK

216
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:33,035
USING HIS VENTRILOQUIST SKILL.

217
00:07:33,035 --> 00:07:34,829
- [imitating George Sr.] 
I CHERISH YOU, GOB.

218
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:36,622
COME HERE AND GIVE ME A KISS.

219
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:37,707
I'M DRIVING, DAD.

220
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:39,959
[as George Sr.] 
NOW!

221
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:41,001
[narrator] 
IT WAS WEIRD.

222
00:07:41,001 --> 00:07:42,503
[kiss]

223
00:07:42,503 --> 00:07:44,338
AND THAT'S WHEN GOB 
NOTICED THE CD AND CARD

224
00:07:44,338 --> 00:07:47,550
THAT HE'D MADE FOR MICHAEL.

225
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:50,260
- IT'S NOT EVEN OPEN. 
MICHAEL!

226
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:52,137
[narrator] 
MEANWHILE, MICHAEL'S

227
00:07:52,137 --> 00:07:53,639
MEETING WITH KITTY WASN'T

228
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:55,349
AS DISTRESSING AS HE'D THOUGHT.

229
00:07:55,349 --> 00:07:56,934
- THE PROGRAM HAS 
CHANGED MY LIFE.

230
00:07:56,934 --> 00:07:58,185
AND I HAVE A SPONSOR NOW.

231
00:07:58,185 --> 00:07:59,604
[whispers] 
HE'S FAMOUS.

232
00:07:59,604 --> 00:08:00,938
- THAT'S GREAT.

233
00:08:00,938 --> 00:08:02,523
- I CAN'T TELL YOU 
WHO HE IS.

234
00:08:02,523 --> 00:08:06,819
BUT LET'S JUST SAY THAT HE WAS 
ON NIGHT COURT.

235
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:09,029
- WELL, YOU LOOK GREAT. 
- I CAN TELL YOU WHO IT'S NOT.

236
00:08:09,029 --> 00:08:11,073
IT'S NOT BULL. 
IT'S NOT HARRY ANDERSON.

237
00:08:11,073 --> 00:08:12,241
- I GOT IT. 
- HE'S WHITE.

238
00:08:12,241 --> 00:08:14,702
- I KNOW WHO IT IS.

239
00:08:14,702 --> 00:08:16,704
- WHAT HAPPENS IS, WHEN I DON'T 
HAVE A MAN IN MY LIFE,

240
00:08:16,704 --> 00:08:17,788
I TEND TO GO A LITTLE CRAZY.

241
00:08:17,788 --> 00:08:19,414
- MM-HMM.

242
00:08:19,414 --> 00:08:20,916
- BUT I'M KEEPING IT 
TOGETHER NOW.

243
00:08:20,916 --> 00:08:22,502
AND I WANTED TO TELL YOU 
I'M NOT GONNA TRY

244
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:25,921
TO HURT YOU GUYS ANYMORE.

245
00:08:25,921 --> 00:08:27,715
- DON'T SUPPOSE I CAN 
GET THAT IN WRITING.

246
00:08:27,715 --> 00:08:29,550
- YOU DID TRY TO BLOW ME UP.

247
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:32,011
- SORRY ABOUT THAT. 
- JUST DON'T PISS ME OFF AGAIN.

248
00:08:32,011 --> 00:08:35,139
[cackles] 
- [chuckling]

249
00:08:35,139 --> 00:08:36,891
YOU ALL RIGHT?

250
00:08:36,891 --> 00:08:38,934
- "OFTENTIMES THE HEART 
ACTS WITHOUT CONSULTING

251
00:08:38,934 --> 00:08:40,686
THE HEAD, AND THUSLY"--

252
00:08:40,686 --> 00:08:43,438
OH, I SEE YOU WASTED NO TIME 
IN FILLING MY SEAT HOLE.

253
00:08:43,438 --> 00:08:45,149
- OH, NO, NO.

254
00:08:45,149 --> 00:08:47,860
I JUST CAME BY SO THAT YOU COULD 
SAY GOOD-BYE TO THESE.

255
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:49,987
- OH, NO, NO, NO, NO.

256
00:08:49,987 --> 00:08:53,282
- IT'S THE LAST TIME YOU'RE 
GOING TO BE SEEING THESE.

257
00:08:53,282 --> 00:08:55,284
- HOW IRONIC. 
I JUST FOUND OUT I'M STAYING.

258
00:08:55,284 --> 00:08:56,869
WILL YOU TAKE THESE BACK?

259
00:08:56,869 --> 00:08:58,913
- OKAY, LET'S JUST ALL 
PUT OUR TOPS DOWN.

260
00:08:58,913 --> 00:09:00,497
JUST PUT 'EM ON DOWN.

261
00:09:00,497 --> 00:09:02,583
YOU'RE NOT GOIN' TO VEGAS?

262
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:05,628
- SADLY, MY WIFE 
SAID NO TO MY DREAM.

263
00:09:05,628 --> 00:09:09,674
SO I SHALL CONTINUE TO TOIL 
THROUGH THIS WAKING LIFE.

264
00:09:09,674 --> 00:09:11,425
- WOW, YOU ARE SO REAL.

265
00:09:11,425 --> 00:09:14,469
WHY CAN'T I MEET 
SOMEONE LIKE YOU?

266
00:09:14,469 --> 00:09:16,013
[narrator] 
AND MICHAEL DECIDED

267
00:09:16,013 --> 00:09:18,140
THAT HE BETTER KEEP KITTY 
OCCUPIED WITH A MAN.

268
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:19,725
AT LEAST 
UNTIL AFTER HIS MEETING.

269
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:21,727
- HEY, GANG, I GOT AN IDEA.

270
00:09:21,727 --> 00:09:24,814
TOBIAS, WHY DON'T YOU TAKE KITTY 
OUT FOR THE AFTERNOON?

271
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:26,816
- [stammering] 
HUH?

272
00:09:26,816 --> 00:09:28,818
- ARE YOU TRYING TO SET UP 
YOUR FORMER ASSISTANT

273
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:29,985
WITH YOUR CURRENT ASSISTANT?

274
00:09:29,985 --> 00:09:31,612
WHAT A GREAT IDEA FOR

275
00:09:31,612 --> 00:09:33,989
A HUGH GRANT-JULIA ROBERTS 
TYPE MOVIE.

276
00:09:33,989 --> 00:09:35,908
- I RECENTLY HEARD THAT 
THE ACTOR,

277
00:09:35,908 --> 00:09:38,535
JOHN LARROQUETTE, WAS LOOKING 
FOR A MEATY CHARACTER PIECE.

278
00:09:38,535 --> 00:09:40,495
[narrator] 
AND SO, FREE OF OBSTACLES,

279
00:09:40,495 --> 00:09:43,290
MICHAEL PREPARED 
TO SIGN THE AFFIDAVIT...

280
00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:46,168
MAINTAINING HE HAD NO IDEA 
WHERE HIS FATHER WAS.

281
00:09:46,168 --> 00:09:47,753
- YOU HAVE NOT BEEN 
IN CONTACT WITH HIM.

282
00:09:47,753 --> 00:09:49,504
ARE YOU PREPARED TO DO THAT?

283
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:05,354
OFFICERS!

284
00:10:05,354 --> 00:10:07,564
MICHAEL, THESE MEN ARE HERE-- 
JUST A LITTLE BIT EARLY--

285
00:10:07,564 --> 00:10:09,316
BECAUSE WE HAVE 
PHOTOGRAPHIC EVIDENCE...

286
00:10:09,316 --> 00:10:11,318
WHICH DISCREDITS 
THE AFFIDAVIT YOU JUST SIGNED.

287
00:10:11,318 --> 00:10:13,112
- ARE THOSE BALLS?

288
00:10:13,112 --> 00:10:15,197
'CAUSE THE LAST TIME WE WERE 
HERE, THEY WERE BALLS.

289
00:10:15,197 --> 00:10:16,573
- THESE ARE NOT BALLS.

290
00:10:16,573 --> 00:10:18,033
THIS WAS TAKEN 
WITH A TRAFFIC CAMERA.

291
00:10:18,033 --> 00:10:19,744
IT SHOWS YOU 
IN YOUR CAR WITH YOUR FATHER

292
00:10:19,744 --> 00:10:21,996
WITHIN THE LAST 24 HOURS.

293
00:10:24,081 --> 00:10:26,458
- I WISH THEY WERE BALLS.

294
00:10:30,087 --> 00:10:32,422
[narrator] 
MICHAEL WAS IN POLICE CUSTODY...

295
00:10:32,422 --> 00:10:35,509
AFTER A PHOTO OF HIM HELPING 
HIS FATHER ESCAPE HAD TURNED UP.

296
00:10:35,509 --> 00:10:37,720
- DID YOU SEE THAT PICTURE? 
THAT'S YOU, RIGHT?

297
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:40,014
WERE YOU HOLDIN' UP 
A PHOTO OF ME OR SOMETHIN'?

298
00:10:40,014 --> 00:10:42,182
- OF COURSE 
YOU DON'T RECOGNIZE IT.

299
00:10:42,182 --> 00:10:44,226
IT'S THE CARD FROM THE CD 
YOU DIDN'T EVEN OPEN.

300
00:10:44,226 --> 00:10:45,686
- YOU FOUND THAT, DID YOU?

301
00:10:45,686 --> 00:10:47,354
- RIGHT BETWEEN THE GEARBOX

302
00:10:47,354 --> 00:10:49,064
AND THE "PULL BACK 
FROM AIRCRAFT" LEVER.

303
00:10:49,064 --> 00:10:51,566
SO THIS IS HOW YOU REPAY ME 
FOR HOW I REPAY YOU?

304
00:10:51,566 --> 00:10:53,610
- I ACTUALLY DID NOT GET 
A CHANCE TO LISTEN TO IT YET.

305
00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:55,112
PROBABLY SHOULD'VE TOLD YOU,

306
00:10:55,112 --> 00:10:56,781
BUT I DIDN'T WANT 
TO HURT YOUR FEELINGS.

307
00:10:56,781 --> 00:10:58,532
- OH, YOU'RE SO SENSITIVE.

308
00:10:58,532 --> 00:11:00,743
JUST LIKE WHEN YOU WHIPPED UP 
THOSE TEARS TALKING ABOUT

309
00:11:00,743 --> 00:11:01,994
HOW MUCH YOU LOVED IT.

310
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:03,704
- I WILL LISTEN TO IT, 
I PROMISE.

311
00:11:03,704 --> 00:11:05,706
BUT I'M IN A LOT OF 
TROUBLE HERE. WHERE IS DAD?

312
00:11:05,706 --> 00:11:07,582
- I'VE GOT HIM STASHED AWAY 
SOMEWHERE SAFE NOW.

313
00:11:07,582 --> 00:11:09,794
- GET HIM, QUICKLY, OTHERWISE 
I'M GONNA BE STUCK IN HERE.

314
00:11:09,794 --> 00:11:11,045
- GOOD!

315
00:11:11,045 --> 00:11:12,504
I HOPE YOU ROT IN HERE! 
- WHAT--

316
00:11:12,504 --> 00:11:14,965
- AND GUESS WHAT ELSE? 
DAD KISSED ME.

317
00:11:14,965 --> 00:11:16,675
- HOW?

318
00:11:16,675 --> 00:11:19,636
HE LOOKED PRETTY UNCONSCIOUS 
IN THAT PICTURE.

319
00:11:19,636 --> 00:11:21,221
- I DIDN'T SAY 
HE WAS TOTALLY INTO IT.

320
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:24,683
[narrator] 
AND GEORGE MICHAEL

321
00:11:24,683 --> 00:11:25,851
TRIED TO BREAK UP WITH ANN.

322
00:11:25,851 --> 00:11:27,477
- I CAN'T GO OUT TOMORROW NIGHT,

323
00:11:27,477 --> 00:11:29,396
'CAUSE THERE'S THIS 
MOVIE PREMIERE AT--

324
00:11:29,396 --> 00:11:30,856
IT'S KINDA RACY, BUT--

325
00:11:30,856 --> 00:11:32,607
- OH, THE COUSIN ONE?

326
00:11:32,607 --> 00:11:34,819
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT. 
I WAS JUST GONNA ASK YOU TO GO.

327
00:11:34,819 --> 00:11:36,528
- YOU WANT TO SEE THAT?

328
00:11:36,528 --> 00:11:38,739
- NO, I WANT TO GET THE WHOLE 
CHURCH GROUP TOGETHER.

329
00:11:38,739 --> 00:11:40,741
WE'RE GONNA 
PICKET THOSE BASTARDS.

330
00:11:40,741 --> 00:11:42,367
[narrator] 
GEORGE MICHAEL HAD ONLY

331
00:11:42,367 --> 00:11:44,036
HEARD ANN SWEAR ONCE BEFORE...

332
00:11:44,036 --> 00:11:45,996
WHEN HE JOINED SOME OF 
HER YOUTH GROUP TO PROTEST

333
00:11:45,996 --> 00:11:47,664
THE HOME OF MARC CHERRY,

334
00:11:47,664 --> 00:11:49,374
EXECUTIVE PRODUCER 
OF THE HIT SHOW

335
00:11:49,374 --> 00:11:50,500
DESPERATE HOUSEWIVES.

336
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:52,044
- IT'S A SATIRE!

337
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:55,297
- THERE'S NOTHING FUNNY 
ABOUT FORNICATION!

338
00:11:55,297 --> 00:11:57,341
- THE BASTARD SAW US!

339
00:11:57,341 --> 00:11:59,259
[narrator] 
AND THE PROMISE OF ANOTHER KISS

340
00:11:59,259 --> 00:12:01,428
WAS TOO ENTICING TO TURN DOWN.

341
00:12:01,428 --> 00:12:03,722
- WELL, YES. 
THE BASTARDS.

342
00:12:03,722 --> 00:12:05,390
[narrator] 
OSCAR, MEANWHILE,

343
00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:07,392
CHECKED IN ON BUSTER.

344
00:12:07,392 --> 00:12:10,479
- [gasps] 
BUSTER! BUSTER! BE CAREFUL!

345
00:12:10,479 --> 00:12:11,897
- IT'S NOT A REAL HAND, 
REMEMBER?

346
00:12:11,897 --> 00:12:13,482
- I'M SO FORGETFUL.

347
00:12:13,482 --> 00:12:14,817
I HOPE YOU DON'T 
GET THAT FROM ME.

348
00:12:14,817 --> 00:12:16,068
- GET THAT FROM YOU?

349
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:17,444
DO YOU FEEL OKAY?

350
00:12:17,444 --> 00:12:18,695
[sizzling]

351
00:12:18,695 --> 00:12:20,865
- [screams] 
JUST FORGET IT!

352
00:12:20,865 --> 00:12:22,491
I WANTED TO SHARE 
MY POP SECRET WITH YOU.

353
00:12:22,491 --> 00:12:25,327
OH, BUT FORGET IT!

354
00:12:25,327 --> 00:12:27,121
- POP SECRET?

355
00:12:28,413 --> 00:12:32,292
POP SE-- 
IS OSCAR MY REAL FATHER?

356
00:12:32,292 --> 00:12:33,836
[narrator] 
LUCILLE, MEANWHILE,

357
00:12:33,836 --> 00:12:35,212
WAS ON THE PHONE WITH MICHAEL.

358
00:12:35,212 --> 00:12:36,755
THEY'RE KEEPING ME OVERNIGHT.

359
00:12:36,755 --> 00:12:38,590
COULD YOU TELL MY SON 
I'M ON A BUSINESS TRIP?

360
00:12:38,590 --> 00:12:39,925
- WHY CAN'T THE GIRL 
AT WORK DO IT?

361
00:12:39,925 --> 00:12:41,635
- TOBIAS?

362
00:12:41,635 --> 00:12:44,513
I SENT HIM ON A DATE WITH KITTY 
TO KEEP HER OFF OUR BACKS.

363
00:12:44,513 --> 00:12:46,348
- YOU BETTER HOPE 
LINDSAY DOESN'T FIND OUT.

364
00:12:46,348 --> 00:12:47,391
SHE'LL BE DEVASTATED.

365
00:12:47,391 --> 00:12:48,851
- FIND OUT WHAT?

366
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:50,519
- YOUR HUSBAND'S DATING 
KITTY THE WHORE.

367
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:54,148
- HE IS? 
THAT'S-- THAT'S HORRIBLE.

368
00:12:54,148 --> 00:12:56,233
- DO I KNOW MY DAUGHTER?

369
00:12:56,233 --> 00:12:58,360
SHE ONLY WANTS 
WHAT SHE CAN'T HAVE.

370
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,778
SINCE YOU'RE 
DEVASTATING PEOPLE,

371
00:12:59,778 --> 00:13:01,196
TELL GOB I'LL BE 
TELLING THE COPS

372
00:13:01,196 --> 00:13:02,322
IT WAS HIM IN THE TRUCK,

373
00:13:02,322 --> 00:13:04,366
SO HE'LL BE JOINING ME HERE.

374
00:13:04,366 --> 00:13:06,952
I'VE GOT A NICE, HARD COT 
WITH HIS NAME ON IT.

375
00:13:06,952 --> 00:13:08,328
- YOU'D DO THAT 
TO YOUR OWN BROTHER?

376
00:13:08,328 --> 00:13:10,915
- I SAID "COT."

377
00:13:10,915 --> 00:13:12,374
- WHERE'S MOTHER?

378
00:13:12,374 --> 00:13:13,959
YOU LIED TO ME.

379
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:15,961
YOU SAID MY FATHER WAS 
MY FATHER, BUT MY UNCLE IS

380
00:13:15,961 --> 00:13:17,587
MY FATHER.

381
00:13:17,587 --> 00:13:21,175
MY FATHER IS MY UNCLE!

382
00:13:21,175 --> 00:13:23,218
[narrator] 
AT THAT MOMENT,

383
00:13:23,218 --> 00:13:25,595
THE GUARDS PLAYED A CD 
THEY'D RECENTLY CONFISCATED.

384
00:13:25,595 --> 00:13:27,222
[Gob] 
NOW I GOT A SPECIAL

385
00:13:27,222 --> 00:13:29,141
THANK YOU TO THE BROTHER 
WHO MADE THIS HAPPEN.

386
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:31,018
- IS THAT FRANKLIN?

387
00:13:31,018 --> 00:13:35,064
- [singing] 
YEAH, I WOULD FIGHT FOR YOU

388
00:13:35,064 --> 00:13:38,817
I'D LIE FOR YOU

389
00:13:38,817 --> 00:13:42,154
WALK THE WIRE 
FOR YOU

390
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:44,739
YEAH 
I'D DIE FOR YOU

391
00:13:44,739 --> 00:13:46,616
[narrator] 
MICHAEL REALIZED THAT HE COULD

392
00:13:46,616 --> 00:13:47,659
NEVER TURN HIS BROTHER IN.

393
00:13:47,659 --> 00:13:48,911
[Gob] 
MICHAEL!

394
00:13:48,911 --> 00:13:50,120
[singing] 
YOU KNOW IT'S TRUE

395
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,288
[narrator] 
GOB, MEANWHILE,

396
00:13:51,288 --> 00:13:52,539
WAS HAVING A SIMILAR EPIPHANY.

397
00:13:52,539 --> 00:13:55,459
- EVERYTHING I DO

398
00:13:55,459 --> 00:13:57,836
I DO IT FOR YOU

399
00:14:00,881 --> 00:14:04,885
BARRY, IT'S GOB. 
TELL MICHAEL NOT TO TESTIFY.

400
00:14:04,885 --> 00:14:07,679
I'M BRINGING IN DAD.

401
00:14:07,679 --> 00:14:10,891
[singing on headset] 
EVERYTHING I DO NOW

402
00:14:10,891 --> 00:14:12,893
FRANKLIN.

403
00:14:12,893 --> 00:14:15,145
[british accent] 
YOU'VE RUINED THE ACT, GOB.

404
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:18,440
[narrator] 
AND LUCILLE CONFRONTED OSCAR.

405
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,900
- YOU TOLD HIM 
YOU WERE HIS FATHER?

406
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:22,236
- I DID NO SUCH THING!

407
00:14:22,236 --> 00:14:23,946
- YOU'RE HIGH! 
- YOU'RE DRUNK!

408
00:14:23,946 --> 00:14:26,490
- NOT THIS TIME. 
I'VE HAD ENOUGH OF YOU.

409
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:29,201
SO SAY GOOD-BYE TO THESE, 
BECAUSE IT'S THE LAST TIME--

410
00:14:31,328 --> 00:14:32,621
[narrator] 
AND ANN IN A PROTEST

411
00:14:32,621 --> 00:14:34,039
AT THE THEATER.

412
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:36,583
- GEORGE MICHAEL? 
ARE YOU PROTESTING THIS?

413
00:14:36,583 --> 00:14:37,667
- THIS ISN'T THE LINE?

414
00:14:37,667 --> 00:14:39,628
- YES, HE IS 
PROTESTING THIS.

415
00:14:39,628 --> 00:14:41,671
HE EVEN HELPED ME 
MAKE THE SIGNS.

416
00:14:41,671 --> 00:14:43,340
- WELL, ONLY MINE 
AND THE ONE THAT SAYS,

417
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:44,799
"THIS IS A TRICKY, GRAY AREA."

418
00:14:44,799 --> 00:14:46,260
- WHAT ARE YOU GUYS 
PROTESTING?

419
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:47,552
- IT'S A DISGUSTING MOVIE...

420
00:14:47,552 --> 00:14:49,138
ABOUT COUSINS 
WHO ARE INTO EACH OTHER.

421
00:14:49,138 --> 00:14:50,680
- ARE THERE ANY MORE SEATS?

422
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:52,432
- YEAH.

423
00:14:52,432 --> 00:14:54,393
IT'S THE BEST 52 MINUTES 
YOU'LL SPEND ALL DAY.

424
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:56,686
- OH, NO. 
WE'RE MAKING IT WORSE.

425
00:14:56,686 --> 00:14:59,273
PREPARE TO BE SWALLOWED 
INTO THE DEPTHS OF HELL!

426
00:14:59,273 --> 00:15:00,900
- I GUESS THAT MEANS NO KISS?

427
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:03,110
- I'M NOT REALLY 
IN THE MOOD FOR A KISS.

428
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:05,362
THIS ISN'T MARC CHERRY'S HOUSE.

429
00:15:12,036 --> 00:15:14,621
- WHERE'S YOUR DAD? 
- I DON'T KNOW. I JUST GOT HERE.

430
00:15:14,621 --> 00:15:15,998
- OH, THAT'S RIGHT.

431
00:15:15,998 --> 00:15:17,374
MOTHER TOLD ME 
HE WENT TO JAIL.

432
00:15:17,374 --> 00:15:18,918
I'M SO MAD AT HER. 
[creaking]

433
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:20,544
GUESS WHO I JUST FOUND OUT 
MY FATHER IS?

434
00:15:20,544 --> 00:15:21,753
- JAIL?

435
00:15:21,753 --> 00:15:23,422
- OSCAR!

436
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:25,215
HE DIDN'T MEAN TO TELL ME, 
BUT I FIGURED IT OUT.

437
00:15:25,215 --> 00:15:27,009
- NO, I MEAN, MY DAD IS IN JAIL?

438
00:15:27,009 --> 00:15:28,843
- I WOULDN'T WORRY ABOUT IT. 
BARRY'S VERY GOOD.

439
00:15:28,843 --> 00:15:31,013
I'M GOING TO TAKE A LONG SHOW.

440
00:15:31,013 --> 00:15:33,223
I DON'T EVEN WANT TO SMELL 
LIKE MOTHER ANYMORE.

441
00:15:33,223 --> 00:15:35,809
- I DON'T THINK WE'RE SUPPOSED 
TO SHOWER RIGHT NOW, BUS--

442
00:15:35,809 --> 00:15:37,602
- TOBIAS BACK YET? 
- NO.

443
00:15:37,602 --> 00:15:39,854
- OH, MY GOD. 
HE'S REALLY OUT WITH HER.

444
00:15:39,854 --> 00:15:41,648
- ARE YOU DRUNK? 
- NOT ENOUGH.

445
00:15:41,648 --> 00:15:43,233
I PUSHED HIM 
RIGHT INTO SOMEONE ELSE'S

446
00:15:43,233 --> 00:15:44,693
SKANKY, BONY ARMS.

447
00:15:44,693 --> 00:15:46,653
WELL, LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING, 
GEORGE MICHAEL.

448
00:15:46,653 --> 00:15:48,363
YOU HAVE TO GRAB LOVE 
WHILE YOU HAVE IT.

449
00:15:48,363 --> 00:15:49,698
DON'T LET IT GET AWAY.

450
00:15:49,698 --> 00:15:51,783
- OH, THERE YOU ARE.

451
00:15:51,783 --> 00:15:54,453
- OH, MAEBY, EVERYTHING'S FINE. 
YOUR DADDY'S JUST OUT.

452
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:56,330
YEAH, WE'RE DOING GREAT.

453
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:58,373
MOMMY'S GONNA TAKE A BATH 
WITH A BOTTLE OF WINE.

454
00:15:58,373 --> 00:16:00,000
- I DON'T KNOW IF 
WE'RE SUPPOSED TO USE--

455
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,501
- SO GET THIS.

456
00:16:01,501 --> 00:16:03,378
ALL THE PRESS ACTUALLY 
MADE THE PREMIERE A HIT.

457
00:16:03,378 --> 00:16:05,380
THERE'S LINES FOR THE NEXT SHOW.

458
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:07,466
THANKS, BUDDY.

459
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:09,259
HEY, LOOK AT THAT.

460
00:16:09,259 --> 00:16:10,844
WE DIDN'T 
GET SWALLOWED UP INTO HELL.

461
00:16:10,844 --> 00:16:12,012
[chuckles]

462
00:16:15,057 --> 00:16:16,976
[narrator] 
AND THAT'S WHEN GEORGE MICHAEL

463
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:18,643
FINALLY GOT CLOSE TO MAEBY,

464
00:16:18,643 --> 00:16:21,771
WHO, BY THE WAY, MIGHT NOT 
BE HIS BIOLOGICAL COUSIN.

465
00:16:21,771 --> 00:16:23,773
JUST THEN, GOB CAME HOME 
TO RETRIEVE HIS FATHER

466
00:16:23,773 --> 00:16:26,360
FROM WHERE HE'D STASHED HIM.

467
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:29,029
- DAD'S GONNA BE CRUSHED. 
- YOU DON'T HAVE TO TELL HIM!

468
00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:30,780
[narrator] 
BUT GOB WAS REFERRING

469
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:32,032
TO HIS OWN FATHER...

470
00:16:32,032 --> 00:16:35,285
WHO HE HAD HIDDEN 
UNDER THE HOUSE.

471
00:16:35,285 --> 00:16:37,204
- UH-OH.

472
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:41,541
[narrator] 
GOB HAD HIDDEN

473
00:16:41,541 --> 00:16:42,626
HIS FATHER UNDER A HOUSE

474
00:16:42,626 --> 00:16:44,461
THAT HAD JUST COLLAPSED.

475
00:16:44,461 --> 00:16:46,713
- CHILDREN, YOU'RE SMALL. 
CRAWL UNDER THERE.

476
00:16:46,713 --> 00:16:48,173
- WE DON'T WANT TO GO 
UNDER THERE.

477
00:16:48,173 --> 00:16:49,258
- HE'S NOT UNDER THERE.

478
00:16:49,258 --> 00:16:51,051
HE GOT AWAY. 
THANK GOD.

479
00:16:51,051 --> 00:16:52,886
[narrator] 
BUT THEN GOB REMEMBERED

480
00:16:52,886 --> 00:16:54,179
THAT THIS MEANT MICHAEL

481
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:55,555
WOULD HAVE TO GO TO PRISON.

482
00:16:56,806 --> 00:17:00,144
- WE-- 
- I--

483
00:17:00,144 --> 00:17:01,936
[narrator] 
AND MICHAEL AND BARRY

484
00:17:01,936 --> 00:17:03,938
MADE THEIR WAY 
TO THE ARRAIGNMENT.

485
00:17:03,938 --> 00:17:05,274
- GOB IS BRINGING YOUR FATHER.

486
00:17:05,274 --> 00:17:06,816
EVERYTHING IS GOING TO 
WORK OUT FINE.

487
00:17:06,816 --> 00:17:08,443
- I WISH THEY'D HURRY UP.

488
00:17:08,443 --> 00:17:10,987
BUT I GOTTA TELL YOU, 
I AM A LITTLE TORN.

489
00:17:10,987 --> 00:17:12,739
MY FATHER, HE HAS CREATED 
A LOT OF PROBLEMS

490
00:17:12,739 --> 00:17:15,242
FOR THE FAMILY...

491
00:17:15,242 --> 00:17:17,911
AND BY STAYING IN THE ATTIC 
HE WAS INSURING I WOULD

492
00:17:17,911 --> 00:17:19,038
GO TO JAIL WITH HIM, BUT--

493
00:17:20,914 --> 00:17:22,957
WELL, MAYBE 
I'M NOT SO TORN.

494
00:17:22,957 --> 00:17:24,543
- MICHAEL. BARRY. 
- HEY, GOB.

495
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:26,128
WHERE'S DAD?

496
00:17:26,128 --> 00:17:27,796
- GREAT NEWS. 
DAD WASN'T CRUSHED TO DEATH.

497
00:17:27,796 --> 00:17:29,089
- WAS THERE RISK OF THAT? 
- YES.

498
00:17:29,089 --> 00:17:30,674
WELL, I HANDCUFFED HIM 
UNDER THE HOUSE.

499
00:17:30,674 --> 00:17:32,634
BUT HE GOT FREE--

500
00:17:32,634 --> 00:17:34,886
THE PIPES I CHAINED HIM TO 
WEREN'T CONNECTED TO ANYTHING.

501
00:17:34,886 --> 00:17:36,305
- OH, I'M NOT PREPARED 
FOR THIS CASE.

502
00:17:36,305 --> 00:17:37,889
- ARE YOU INSANE?

503
00:17:37,889 --> 00:17:40,059
- NO "THANK YOU" FOR TRYING?

504
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:41,976
- I'M SICK OF YOU NEEDING 
CONSTANT VALIDATION

505
00:17:41,976 --> 00:17:43,437
FOR SCREWING UP.

506
00:17:43,437 --> 00:17:45,105
LET ME TELL YOU 
WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN.

507
00:17:45,105 --> 00:17:48,067
I'M GONNA TELL THEM 
IT WAS YOU IN THE STAIR CAR.

508
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:51,111
- WELL, LET ME TELL YOU 
WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN.

509
00:17:51,111 --> 00:17:52,946
FIRST, I'M GONNA BEAT 
THE CRAP OUT OF YOU,

510
00:17:52,946 --> 00:17:54,573
THEN I'M GONNA CALL 
AN AMBULANCE.

511
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:56,366
THEN KNOWING YOU, 
I'M GONNA HAVE TO WAIT

512
00:17:56,366 --> 00:17:57,534
FOR SOME KIND OF AN APOLOGY.

513
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:01,538
[grunts] 
- COME HERE!

514
00:18:03,498 --> 00:18:05,250
[narrator] 
AS THE BOYS SET

515
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:07,336
TO ONCE AGAIN FIGHTING 
IN FRONT OF THE COURTHOUSE--

516
00:18:07,336 --> 00:18:09,003
- STOP IT! STOP IT!

517
00:18:09,003 --> 00:18:10,714
[narrator] 
THE FAMILY BEGAN TO SHOW UP

518
00:18:10,714 --> 00:18:12,674
FOR THE ARRAIGNMENT.

519
00:18:12,674 --> 00:18:14,926
- I KNOW YOU'RE IN THE MIDDLE 
OF SOMETHING, BUT I'M AFRAID

520
00:18:14,926 --> 00:18:16,095
I CAN'T WORK FOR YOU TODAY.

521
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:17,554
I'M GOING TO VEGAS WITH KITTY.

522
00:18:17,554 --> 00:18:19,139
[narrator] 
BUT LINDSAY WASN'T ABOUT TO

523
00:18:19,139 --> 00:18:20,599
LOSE HER MAN WITHOUT A FIGHT.

524
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:22,309
- OVER MY DEAD BODY!

525
00:18:22,309 --> 00:18:24,644
- [Tobias] 
OH, MY--

526
00:18:24,644 --> 00:18:29,023
- HEY! HEY! I SAID-- 
I SAID ENOUGH!

527
00:18:29,023 --> 00:18:30,900
NOW, STOP IT.

528
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:32,486
I AM SO TIRED 
OF THIS FAMILY FIGHTING.

529
00:18:32,486 --> 00:18:35,197
THE ANGER ENDS NOW.

530
00:18:35,197 --> 00:18:39,659
YOU'RE BROTHERS, AND BROTHERS 
STICK TOGETHER NO MATTER WHAT.

531
00:18:40,702 --> 00:18:42,746
FAMILIES STICK TOGETHER.

532
00:18:42,746 --> 00:18:46,583
I HAVE TORN THIS FAMILY APART 
WITH MY LIES AND MY COWARDICE,

533
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:48,877
BUT THAT COMES 
TO AN END NOW.

534
00:18:48,877 --> 00:18:51,087
SO I'M TURNING MYSELF IN.

535
00:18:51,087 --> 00:18:54,674
I DON'T WANT YOU TO COME AND 
VISIT ME IN PRISON THIS TIME.

536
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:59,179
'CAUSE YOU DESERVE OSCAR NOW.

537
00:19:05,769 --> 00:19:08,230
- TOBIAS, I ACTUALLY 
FOUGHT FOR YOU.

538
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:10,274
- I CAN'T BELIEVE IT. 
[chuckles]

539
00:19:10,274 --> 00:19:14,153
I'M GOING TO VEGAS WITH KITTY. 
- HUH?

540
00:19:21,201 --> 00:19:23,912
- OH, GEORGE, 
I'VE LOST YOU AGAIN.

541
00:19:23,912 --> 00:19:26,540
- TAKE BACK OSCAR, MOTHER.

542
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:28,500
- I THINK I LOST HIM TOO.

543
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:29,793
[narrator] 
IN FACT, OSCAR

544
00:19:29,793 --> 00:19:31,628
WAS ON HIS WAY OUT OF TOWN...

545
00:19:31,628 --> 00:19:34,173
WHEN HE WAS 
APPROACHED BY GEORGE SR.,

546
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:36,216
WHO HAD JUST ESCAPED 
FROM UNDER THE HOUSE.

547
00:19:36,216 --> 00:19:38,260
- I WANT YOU TO TURN ME IN 
SO YOU CAN GET THE REWARD,

548
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:40,387
TAKE CARE OF THE FAMILY.

549
00:19:40,387 --> 00:19:42,681
- WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT 
FOR ME?

550
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:44,349
- BECAUSE WE'RE BROTHERS.

551
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,186
[narrator] 
LATER, WHILE GEORGE SR.

552
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:50,063
WAS SHAVING HIS UNCONSCIOUS 
BROTHER'S HEAD,

553
00:19:50,063 --> 00:19:52,065
HE WONDERED WHETHER 
THERE REALLY WAS A REWARD,

554
00:19:52,065 --> 00:19:54,568
AND IF HE COULD GET IT.

555
00:19:54,568 --> 00:19:57,321
BUT THERE WAS NO TIME, 
AND GETTING EVEN

556
00:19:57,321 --> 00:19:59,448
WITH HIS BROTHER 
WAS REWARD ENOUGH.

557
00:20:01,408 --> 00:20:03,327
SO IT WAS OSCAR

558
00:20:03,327 --> 00:20:06,162
WHO WAS GOING TO BE SPENDING 
A LITTLE TIME ALONE IN PRISON.

559
00:20:06,162 --> 00:20:07,914
- I GUESS DAD 
FINALLY CAME THROUGH FOR US.

560
00:20:07,914 --> 00:20:09,708
HE ACTUALLY MADE A SACRIFICE.

561
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:12,001
ALTHOUGH WHO KNOWS 
WHAT HE'S UP TO.

562
00:20:12,001 --> 00:20:13,878
WE SHOULD JUST STAY AWAY 
FROM HIM, LET HIM HAVE

563
00:20:13,878 --> 00:20:15,129
A LITTLE TIME ALONE IN PRISON.

564
00:20:15,129 --> 00:20:16,673
HE IS RIGHT 
ABOUT ONE THING, THOUGH.

565
00:20:16,673 --> 00:20:18,383
WE'RE BROTHERS. 
WE SHOULDN'T BE FIGHTING.

566
00:20:18,383 --> 00:20:19,801
WE CANNOT AFFORD 
TO LOSE EACH OTHER.

567
00:20:19,801 --> 00:20:20,927
- I CAN'T.

568
00:20:20,927 --> 00:20:22,262
I ALREADY LOST 
A BROTHER TODAY.

569
00:20:22,262 --> 00:20:24,264
- FRANKLIN?

570
00:20:24,264 --> 00:20:26,808
- WELL, I DIDN'T LOSE HIM. 
BUT HE'S ALL PUCKERED AND WHITE.

571
00:20:26,808 --> 00:20:28,310
- ON THE PLUS SIDE,

572
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:29,936
YOU CAN TAKE HIM TO LUNCH 
AT THE CLUB NOW.

573
00:20:29,936 --> 00:20:32,439
- THAT'S THE KIND OF JOKE 
HE WOULD HAVE LOVED.

574
00:20:32,439 --> 00:20:34,441
- OH, MAN!

575
00:20:34,441 --> 00:20:36,610
[sighs]

576
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:38,320
- [singing] 
YOU KNOW IT'S TRUE

577
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:42,031
EVERYTHING I DO 
- PLEASE DON'T DO THIS.

578
00:20:42,031 --> 00:20:44,326
- I DO IT FOR YOU 
- ALL RIGHT.

579
00:20:44,326 --> 00:20:46,620
[grunting]

580
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:48,037
[narrator] 
ON THE NEXT SEASON

581
00:20:48,037 --> 00:20:50,081
OF ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT.

582
00:20:50,081 --> 00:20:52,166
- I BURNED THEM 
ON A CORNBALLER.

583
00:20:52,166 --> 00:20:54,168
[narrator] 
OSCAR, ROBBED OF

584
00:20:54,168 --> 00:20:57,256
HIS FINGERPRINTS, HAS DIFFICUY 
PROVING HIS IDENTITY,

585
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:59,258
- MY HAIR'S GONNA GROW BACK. 
YOU'LL SEE.

586
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:01,301
[narrator] 
TOBIAS AND KITTY GO TO VEGAS,

587
00:21:01,301 --> 00:21:03,262
ONLY TO FIND THAT HIS DREAM JOB 
HAS BEEN FILLED.

588
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:04,679
- YOU FOUND SOMEONE ALREADY?

589
00:21:04,679 --> 00:21:06,473
- JUST CAME OUT OF NOWHERE, 
THIS GUY.

590
00:21:06,473 --> 00:21:09,768
AND THE GREAT THING IS, 
HE'S NEVER OUT OF CHARACTER.

591
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:11,811
[narrator] 
AND GEORGE SR.

592
00:21:11,811 --> 00:21:14,689
TURNS OUT TO BE RIGHT 
ABOUT THE EFFECTS OF STRESS.

593
00:21:14,689 --> 00:21:17,401
- WHAT'S HAPPENING TO ME? 
WHY WON'T IT GROW BACK?
