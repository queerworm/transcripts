{\an8}You look great.

12
00:00:44,753 --> 00:00:46,671
{\an8}That suit looks very hetero on you.

13
00:00:46,755 --> 00:00:49,424
{\an8}Well, thank you.
You look very hetero as well.

14
00:00:49,507 --> 00:00:52,802
Now, how are you?

15
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:54,512
I'm as normal as blueberry pie.

16
00:00:54,637 --> 00:00:57,140
{\an8}So, write that down on a form,
sign me out,

17

{\an8}I won't have to
go back to prison,

18

{\an8}[narrator]
<i>And later received a chilling reminder</i>

Hi.
Sorry, I thought you were somebody else.

32
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:52,403
I can't tell you who 'cause I'm dating
someone famous.

I'm busy now working with Michael.

What are you working on with Michael?

37
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:02,455
Dad made him give me a job.

38

Isn't that nice?

00:02:11,047 --> 00:02:13,550
{\an8}My God, is there anyone there
with half a brain

42
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:14,717
{\an8}that can help me with this?

43
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:17,512
{\an8}I don't know about half a brain,
but Tobias is living with me right now,

44
00:02:17,595 --> 00:02:18,721
{\an8}and he's not very bright.

45
00:02:19,097 --> 00:02:22,350
{\an8}Although he is working in
the rehab where Lucille 2 is.

46

{\an8}Hire a crew and start the wall.

47
00:02:24,477 --> 00:02:25,728
{\an8}And not a word to your brother.

48
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:27,355
{\an8}I'm getting a transfer.

49
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:30,859
{\an8}It's time for Mama

Yes, well, it doesn't work that way.

55
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:45,540
We have to have a series of sessions,

56
00:02:45,623 --> 00:02:48,918

of my professional opinion

57

and made every effort

58

{\an8}at thoughtfully reflecting
upon your weaknesses.

59
00:02:53,923 --> 00:02:56,009
{\an8}Yes! Write down that I did that.

Oh, no, no, this doesn't pay.
This is part of a work release program.

[narrator] <i>It seems Lucille</i>

Yes.

68

Maeby.

69
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:16,070
The state of California thinks
that I'm a sex offender.

70
00:03:16,154 --> 00:03:19,407
Don't worry about
what the state of California thinks.

71
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:22,202
The point is, we have a chance
to be honest with ourselves.

72
00:03:22,285 --> 00:03:25,163
Fine. You don't look heterosexual
in that suit.

73
00:03:26,122 --> 00:03:27,290
Sign the form.

74
00:03:27,373 --> 00:03:29,626
Well, at least we have a dialog going.

75
00:03:30,126 --> 00:03:32,503
[narrator]
<i>But that would end by their next session.</i>

76
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:41,846
Perhaps that's why they call this place...

77
00:03:42,263 --> 00:03:44,265
Auster-ity.

78
00:03:51,606 --> 00:03:52,815
Auster...

79
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:55,652
Fine. Well, if you're not going to talk,

80
00:03:55,735 --> 00:03:57,695
I'm just going to write this up.

81
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:01,407
[narrator] <i>Earlier that day,</i>
<i>Tobias had encountered a prop problem</i>

82

00:04:03,117 --> 00:04:04,369
...one thing we could use.

84
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:05,787
A villain.

85
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:07,538
I was thinking the same thing.

86
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:10,166
Why aren't the Fantastic Four
fighting anyone?

87
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:12,001
Instead of just dancing around,
you mean.

88
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:14,087
It's like it's all Sharks and no Jets.

89
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:16,047
Then we would have a second act.

90
00:04:16,172 --> 00:04:17,382
Lucia, right?

91
00:04:17,966 --> 00:04:20,510
I mean, that's their foe.
Lucia von Bardas?

92
00:04:21,552 --> 00:04:23,972
Have you guys ever even
read one of these things?

93
00:04:24,722 --> 00:04:26,891
This woman is a villain.

94
00:04:26,975 --> 00:04:28,351
You think I'm a villain, too?

95
00:04:29,644 --> 00:04:32,689
My children are all waiting for me to die
so they can divvy up my stuff.

96
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:34,107
My Chinese gang mates

97
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:35,900
were getting ready to noodle stab me,

98
00:04:36,609 --> 00:04:38,820
and even one of the guards
called me "Gangie"

99
00:04:38,903 --> 00:04:40,655
and he was talking
about the monster movie.

100
00:04:40,738 --> 00:04:43,283
He thinks that horrible monster
looks like me!

101
00:04:43,366 --> 00:04:45,118
So fine, you want to call me a villain,

102
00:04:45,201 --> 00:04:46,869
I accept it! I'm your villain!

103
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:50,206
Actually I was writing down
a casting breakdown

104
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:53,751
for the role of Lucia
for my <i>Fantastic Four</i> musical.

105
00:04:53,876 --> 00:04:56,713
This was all about your stupid play?

106
00:04:57,297 --> 00:05:00,508
I was about to cry for the first time
in 60 years.

107
00:05:00,591 --> 00:05:03,052
I remember when the last time was, too.

108
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:06,264
I hid under Mama's porch
during a thunderstorm.

109
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:08,224
and I found the remains of my...

110
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:10,476
It's not a stupid play.

111
00:05:10,601 --> 00:05:12,312
It's a musical.

112
00:05:12,395 --> 00:05:15,023
And I have to debut it
on a boat at Cinco.

113
00:05:16,691 --> 00:05:17,692
It's on a boat?

114
00:05:17,775 --> 00:05:18,943
Take to the sea!

115
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:21,904
Yes, I'll sign everyone out
for the night,

116
00:05:22,488 --> 00:05:25,241
but I guess I'll have to play
the old sea bitch myself.

117
00:05:25,533 --> 00:05:26,367
I'm in.

118
00:05:27,285 --> 00:05:30,747
Well, that's wonderful. I think we have
made a breakthrough today.

119
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:32,457
In the musical, not you.

120
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:35,084
Oh, God, no, there's miles of work to do
with you. [laughs]

No, no, you are the Depardieu.

131
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:02,862
No sweets.

132
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:09,035
[narrator]<i> Michael wasn't proud</i>
<i>of what he was about to do.</i>

Hey, Lem, I can reach the ice cream

134

I will give you this Dove bar

Tell me what you know
about this...

George Maharis.

140
00:06:26,677 --> 00:06:28,638
Not much. He's old.

141
00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:29,972
Is he older than me?

142
00:06:30,556 --> 00:06:32,517
Few years. He looks like you.

143
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,602
[narrator]<i> He knew this was not good news.</i>

144
00:06:34,769 --> 00:06:35,853
So, handsome.

[narrator] <i>Who'd come up</i>

<i>But what about love?</i>

170
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:42,670
Easy. Gene Parmesan got photos
of Herbert Love

171
00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:44,088
with some redheaded whore.

172
00:07:44,172 --> 00:07:46,340
[narrator]
<i>That's not what he meant by love.</i>

173
00:07:46,424 --> 00:07:49,260
I'm giving his wife a taste,
so he knows we know.

174
00:07:49,385 --> 00:07:52,305
If he wins, we should be able to get him
to do whatever we want

175
00:07:52,388 --> 00:07:54,015
<i>with that wall now.</i>

176
00:07:54,098 --> 00:07:57,685
<i>I'm not completely following</i>
<i>the wall story. Here's my problem--</i>

177
00:07:57,768 --> 00:08:00,813
-Hello.
-[man] <i>Michael Bluth here to see you.</i>

178
00:08:00,897 --> 00:08:02,231
Send him up.

179
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:04,442
-[Oscar] <i>With my teeth--</i>
-Michael's here.

180
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:07,862
This is my chance to make sure he doesn't
get too cozy with Gob.

181
00:08:07,945 --> 00:08:11,199
-Why?
-Bad things happen when brothers collude.

182
00:08:14,285 --> 00:08:15,828
When can we have sex?

183
00:08:15,912 --> 00:08:17,371
[phone beeps]

184
00:08:18,372 --> 00:08:21,709
Thank you very much.
Hello, there. Thank you.

185
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:22,877
Wow.

186
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:24,462
This is a step up from prison.

187
00:08:24,545 --> 00:08:27,590
How would you know?
You haven't come to visit me once.

188
00:08:27,715 --> 00:08:30,092
Yeah. Sorry. I feel bad about that.

189
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:32,136
So you're here to make amends?

190
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:34,847
Because you know your mother
will always take you back.

191
00:08:34,972 --> 00:08:36,891
And because I know
my mother wants me

192
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:39,268
to sign away any connection
to the family business.

193
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:40,269
[narrator] <i>It was true.</i>

194
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:45,733
<i>The real George Sr. made it a condition</i>
<i>of the now four-favor family pact.</i>

195
00:08:45,816 --> 00:08:48,611
You know, your mother
is very hurt you haven't visited her.

196
00:08:48,694 --> 00:08:51,197
It's like you have given up
on the family business.

197
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,990
-I have.
-Yes, but not in writing.

198
00:08:53,074 --> 00:08:54,909
To protect all of us, visit her,

199
00:08:54,992 --> 00:08:57,161
sign a little something
saying it's all hers.

200
00:08:57,245 --> 00:08:59,080
-I just need a signature.
-I'm happy to help.

201
00:08:59,288 --> 00:09:00,790
If you do something...

202
00:09:01,123 --> 00:09:02,250
-for me.
-For me.

203
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:04,252
Yeah, I heard
that's been happening.

204
00:09:04,961 --> 00:09:06,712
I'm happy to help you, honey.

205
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:07,630
Me, too.

206

-So, everything else is good?
-Yeah.

212
00:09:27,525 --> 00:09:29,986
You've talked to your sister, the radical?

213
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:32,238
Yeah, she's a redhead now,
and she's dating Herbert Love,

214
00:09:32,321 --> 00:09:33,906
but other than her looks
and her belief system,

215
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:35,157
she's the same old Lindsay.

216
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:36,826
That's Lindsay in the photo.

217
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:38,327
I hear you're dating an actress,

218
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:39,829
who's also dating Ron Howard?

219
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:42,623
[laughs] No, no, no, no, no.

220
00:09:42,748 --> 00:09:44,166
She is not dating
Ron Howard, Mother.

221
00:09:44,292 --> 00:09:46,502
Ron Howard is her father, okay?

222
00:09:47,336 --> 00:09:48,421
Your mind...

223
00:09:49,463 --> 00:09:51,632
I did, though, actually find out
who she is dating.

224
00:09:51,882 --> 00:09:53,718
George Maharis.

225
00:09:54,719 --> 00:09:56,512
[narrator]
<i>And that's when Lucille found a way</i>

226
00:09:56,637 --> 00:09:58,472
<i>to keep the brothers from colluding.</i>

227
00:09:58,556 --> 00:10:02,101
George Maharis...
George. That's your brother's name.

228
00:10:02,184 --> 00:10:03,102
George Oscar Bluth.

229
00:10:03,185 --> 00:10:07,273
Yes, uh, George is
Gob's first name, yep.

230
00:10:07,356 --> 00:10:10,359
[narrator] <i>And Michael remembered</i>
<i>something else strange.</i>

231
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:15,406
I probably should
have expected that.

232
00:10:15,573 --> 00:10:16,949
[narrator] <i>And then stranger.</i>

233
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:18,409
[Michael] "Love each other."

234
00:10:18,492 --> 00:10:20,995
Oh, that definitely sounds like Gob.

235
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,456
And he did say he was
seeing someone famous...

236
00:10:23,581 --> 00:10:26,000
[narrator] <i>And Michael remembered hearing</i>
<i>about that as well.</i>

237

238
00:10:28,169 --> 00:10:29,045
Oh.

239
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:30,921
And they're both bit of a celebrities.

240
00:10:31,255 --> 00:10:34,216
That is odd, because I'm also
dating a celebrity.

241
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:37,219
If I were you, I'd put a tail on him.
Get a PI.

242
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:39,096
Where the hell am I gonna find a PI?

243
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:42,558
Gene Parmesan, at your service.

244
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:44,477
[shouts] It's Gene!

245
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,937
He does this to me every time!

246
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:48,981
-What's he doing here, Mom?
-He's working for me.

247
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:50,066
Why'd you scream then?

248
00:10:50,941 --> 00:10:52,943
I thought he was that guy.

249
00:10:53,527 --> 00:10:55,905
[narrator] <i>But Gob wasn't dating Rebel.</i>

250

We're on.

252
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:00,701
And he definitely thinks you're gay,
right?

253
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:03,746
Don't worry, the only thing
I'm better at than [bleeps] women

254
00:11:04,705 --> 00:11:05,790
is pretending I'm gay.

255
00:11:05,873 --> 00:11:07,833
[narrator]
<i>As it turns out, Tony was dating</i>

256

Give me a little leg shave?

258
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:13,547
All right. You have to be careful.

259
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:16,092
If Gob finds out you're straight,
he'll use it to ruin you,

260
00:11:16,384 --> 00:11:19,428
and I'll lose the 100 grand I stole
from Lucille Austero

261
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:21,347
to re-brand you as the gay magician.

-Ow!
-Ooh. Sorry.

264
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:29,563
It's fine. And as long as we're recapping
things that we already know,

265
00:11:29,647 --> 00:11:33,734
an inside source tells me
he's my ticket to Internet billions.

00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:36,070
-Inside source?
-I didn't tell you that?

-No.
-That's new?

268
00:11:37,905 --> 00:11:40,032
It's "in the bag."

271
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:47,248
[narrator]
<i>Because it was Tony that was in the bag.</i>

272

hack into his software and make a fortune.
Ow!

279

How do you not know
how to shave a leg?

280
00:12:09,103 --> 00:12:10,396
I've never done it before.

281
00:12:11,897 --> 00:12:14,942
Anyway, he's halfway
to falling in love with me already.

282

I mean, he actually sounded excited
about seeing me tonight.

283
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:19,363
Just be careful.

284
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:22,908
Could be a house of cards.

00:14:29,326 --> 00:14:31,078
First of all, that's very dated of you,
Michael.

334
00:14:31,161 --> 00:14:32,413
"He's" don't like to be called "she's,"

335
00:14:32,496 --> 00:14:34,540
and I don't know who this he-man is
that you're referring to.

336
00:14:34,623 --> 00:14:36,292
No, no, it's a "she." My girlfriend.

337
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:38,586
That's who I'm talking about.
Rebel Alley. Where is she?

338
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:40,588
-Never met him.
-It's a she.

339
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:42,089
Nice try. Now what are you doing here?

340
00:14:42,214 --> 00:14:43,716
You gonna meet her here
with her son maybe

341
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:45,217
so her son can play in the ball pit?

342
00:14:45,342 --> 00:14:47,344
That's disgusting, Michael.
This is no place for a child.

343
00:14:47,511 --> 00:14:48,804
I know what you do.

344
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:51,223
Mom told me you were bragging
about seeing somebody in showbiz.

345
00:14:51,473 --> 00:14:53,893
Then I see a frozen dove in a freezer.

346
00:14:53,976 --> 00:14:55,686
-That could be anything.
-It said "love each other"

347
00:14:55,769 --> 00:14:57,605
-on the foot band.
-That does sound like mine.

348
00:14:57,771 --> 00:14:58,981
Whose freezer was it in?

349
00:14:59,064 --> 00:15:00,608
Rebel. Rebel Alley's. Nice try, Gob.

350
00:15:00,691 --> 00:15:01,775
If I want to see bad acting,

351
00:15:01,859 --> 00:15:03,736
I'll go see Tobias in
<i>A Jew Comes to Dinner.</i>

352
00:15:03,819 --> 00:15:05,279
[narrator] <i>But Gob wasn't acting.</i>

353
00:15:05,362 --> 00:15:07,364
<i>He'd just forgotten that he had met</i>

<i>one year earlier.</i>

355
00:15:10,367 --> 00:15:11,952
He's so cute.

356
00:15:12,036 --> 00:15:14,914
[narrator] <i>And Rebel returned home</i>
<i>to an unfortunate surprise.</i>

357
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:21,378

359
00:15:26,342 --> 00:15:28,260

360
00:15:28,552 --> 00:15:32,514
<i>It was a merry mix-up,</i>
<i>but neither of them knew any of this.</i>

361
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:35,851
-I have no idea what you're talking about.
-Yes, you do. I got you dead to rights.

362
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:37,394
Dead to rights!

363
00:15:37,895 --> 00:15:39,939
If ever we were
gonna have a fight, Michael,

364
00:15:40,522 --> 00:15:41,982
this would be the safest place
to do it.

365
00:15:42,066 --> 00:15:43,901
-[Michael] Great, let's do--
-[shouting]

366
00:15:43,984 --> 00:15:48,280
{\an8}...something that can fillet a chicken
and subdue an intruder.

367
00:15:52,326 --> 00:15:53,619
Back to My Little Ballroom?

368
00:15:54,036 --> 00:15:55,329
Yeah, this is the middle of their workday.

369
00:15:55,412 --> 00:15:57,247
Hey, hey, come back here!

370
00:15:57,331 --> 00:15:59,041
You son of a bitch, Gob!

371
00:15:59,124 --> 00:16:00,542
You'll never catch me, Michael!

372
00:16:05,881 --> 00:16:07,716
You have to find me, Michael!

373
00:16:11,345 --> 00:16:12,221
Gob?

374
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:15,099

Are we done?

378
00:16:25,901 --> 00:16:27,444
I'm just surprisingly tired.

379
00:16:27,528 --> 00:16:30,072
So tired and so not hurt.

380
00:16:30,739 --> 00:16:32,199
I'm not the guy, Michael.

381
00:16:32,449 --> 00:16:34,785
I thought you'd be proud of me.
I did what you said.

382
00:16:34,868 --> 00:16:37,162
I filled all your houses.

383
00:16:37,246 --> 00:16:38,330
Hang on. Filled 'em?

384
00:16:38,414 --> 00:16:39,915
Every last one of 'em.

385
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:41,250
With who?

386
00:16:42,459 --> 00:16:43,585
With sex offenders.

387
00:16:45,421 --> 00:16:48,882
Hey, hey!
Gob, you're out of the movie!

388
00:16:48,966 --> 00:16:51,468
[boy]
Thanks for ruining my birthday party.

389
00:16:56,724 --> 00:17:01,520
[narrator] <i>Gob went to win back the trust</i>
<i>of the man he was still hoping to con.</i>

390
00:17:01,603 --> 00:17:02,646
Hey, look--

391
00:17:03,397 --> 00:17:05,065
Oh, my God. You're mad at me.

392
00:17:05,816 --> 00:17:06,942
You stood me up.

393
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:10,195
[narrator] <i>Although he quickly lost sight</i>
<i>of that plan.</i>

394
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:12,990
And then I got in this fight
with my brother that didn't hurt.

395
00:17:13,073 --> 00:17:13,991
-It was just a whole--
-Is that it?

396
00:17:14,074 --> 00:17:17,453
Or is it because your boyfriend is 20,
and I'm nearly twice that?

397
00:17:17,578 --> 00:17:21,540
You think that I care
that you're three years older than me?

398
00:17:21,665 --> 00:17:23,876
No! I don't-- Check my phone.
Check my phone.

399
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:25,252
I don't need to check your phone.
Come in.

400

[narrator] <i>But getting Gob's boyfriend's</i>

402

The whole family hates me.

403
00:17:33,093 --> 00:17:34,928
-Damn it!
-Which he remembered too late.

404
00:17:35,012 --> 00:17:36,138
Yeah, damn it!

405
00:17:36,221 --> 00:17:39,641
I even helped fill his stupid homes
with sex offenders,

406
00:17:39,767 --> 00:17:40,851
and yet he still hates me.

407
00:17:40,934 --> 00:17:43,020
Sex offenders need a place to live, too.

408
00:17:43,103 --> 00:17:46,607
Yes! Exactly! That's what I always say.

409
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:48,984
It's, like, God... You get me.

410
00:17:49,109 --> 00:17:50,444
You're an easy guy to get.

411
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:52,905
I can't go home.
He's probably waiting for me.

412
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:55,282
He's gonna be my boss?
He's the younger brother.

413
00:17:55,616 --> 00:17:57,451
-How old is he?
-Forty-two.

414
00:17:57,534 --> 00:18:00,829
Same! My younger brother's 42, also.

415
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:02,581
Same! But...

416

-I mean 32.
-Two.

-Thirty-two.
-Thirty-two! Same!

-Same! I was gonna say it.
-Same?

419
00:18:08,045 --> 00:18:09,838
-I was thinking the same.
-That's so weird!

420
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:12,174
You thought 32 and then you said 32!

421
00:18:12,299 --> 00:18:13,550
-Same.
-Same.

422
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:15,135
Crazy!

423
00:18:15,219 --> 00:18:16,303
Do you want a glass of wine?

424
00:18:16,386 --> 00:18:17,346
I love wine.

425
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:19,932
-Red wine? Same!
-I love red wine! Same!

426
00:18:20,015 --> 00:18:22,101
[laughs] It's, like, two same.

Same.

443
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:56,552
That's the same time I got into magic.

444
00:18:56,718 --> 00:18:58,554
You know, I think I got into misdirection
'cause I just...

445
00:18:59,263 --> 00:19:01,390
Maybe I was trying to hide my feelings
or something.

446
