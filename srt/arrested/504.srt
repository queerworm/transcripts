{\an8}[Ron Howard] <i>Now the story</i>
<i>of a wealthy family</i>

2
00:00:12,345 --> 00:00:15,473
{\an8}<i>who lost everything,</i>
<i>and the one son who had no choice</i>

3
00:00:15,557 --> 00:00:17,142
{\an8}<i>but to keep them all together.</i>

4
00:00:23,148 --> 00:00:24,858
{\an8}<i>It's...</i>

5
00:00:29,446 --> 00:00:32,157
{\an8}[Ron] <i>Michael Bluth was visiting</i>
<i>the family business,</i>

6
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:34,617
{\an8}<i>hoping to find Lucille Austero,</i>

7
00:00:34,701 --> 00:00:36,745
{\an8}<i>who was now a majority stakeholder,</i>

8
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,329
{\an8}<i>to thank the woman...</i>

9
00:00:38,413 --> 00:00:40,290
{\an8}-They closed the company.
<i>-...for forgiving his debt.</i>

10
00:00:40,373 --> 00:00:42,333
{\an8}-[man] Don't mind me, I work downstairs.
-Hi.

11
00:00:42,417 --> 00:00:44,044
{\an8}Doing a little lunch looting. [laughs]

12
00:00:44,127 --> 00:00:47,088
{\an8}-You?
-It was my family's company.

13
00:00:47,172 --> 00:00:48,131
{\an8}I'm Michael Bluth.

14
00:00:48,214 --> 00:00:50,842
{\an8}Hey.
You guys put me in my first house.

15
00:00:51,259 --> 00:00:54,262
{\an8}Oh, yeah,
a lot of people's first house was a Bluth.

16
00:00:54,345 --> 00:00:57,140
{\an8}No, no, I was part of that
Cornballer class action suit.

17
00:00:57,223 --> 00:00:58,308
{\an8}-I see.
-Yeah,

18
00:00:58,391 --> 00:01:01,227
{\an8}I made enough to put a down payment
on a Sitwell.

19
00:01:01,311 --> 00:01:04,939
{\an8}Well, we've put a lot of people
in Sitwells, too.

20
00:01:06,357 --> 00:01:07,442
{\an8}[elevator bell dings]

21
00:01:09,486 --> 00:01:11,863
{\an8}-Uh-- oh, God, well, you caught us.
-[grunts]

22
00:01:11,946 --> 00:01:14,407
{\an8}Didn't think anybody would be getting on
while we were getting off.

23
00:01:14,491 --> 00:01:16,201
{\an8}What did you do to the Bluth Company?

24
00:01:16,284 --> 00:01:17,952
{\an8}You've been president two weeks.

25
00:01:18,036 --> 00:01:20,205
{\an8}-Took us to the next level.
-[man] An iPhone 5 charger!

26
00:01:20,288 --> 00:01:21,331
{\an8}Fourth floor.

27
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:25,126
{\an8}[Ron] <i>Even the landlord was surprised</i>
<i>by the move.</i>

28
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:26,419
{\an8}Not only would you have to pay

29
00:01:26,503 --> 00:01:29,672
{\an8}a penalty to get out of your old lease,
but the rent is double.

30
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:31,800
{\an8}Just to see the roof of a Rite Aid?

31
00:01:31,883 --> 00:01:35,053
{\an8}[Ron] <i>Which was the first that G.O.B.</i>
<i>had heard of the view.</i>

32
00:01:35,678 --> 00:01:36,930
{\an8}I'll take it.

33
00:01:37,806 --> 00:01:39,224
{\an8}[Michael] Okay, okay. Okay.

34
00:01:39,307 --> 00:01:40,308
{\an8}Ding.

35
00:01:41,351 --> 00:01:42,644
{\an8}[G.O.B.] So?

36
00:01:42,727 --> 00:01:44,062
What do you think? [laughs]

37
00:01:44,145 --> 00:01:46,356
It used to be a 2 Hour Teeth,
the whole place.

38
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:48,233
[Michael] Yeah, I remember the screams.

39
00:01:48,316 --> 00:01:50,735
I guess it was the 90 Minute Tooth guys
across the street

40
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:52,946
that put the 2 Hour guys out of business.

41
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:55,198
I did see that the old Blockbuster
is becoming

42
00:01:55,281 --> 00:01:58,785
an "Hour Mouth," so those guys
gotta be shitting themselves.

43
00:01:58,868 --> 00:02:01,204
Why did you move  the business?
This is exactly the same.

44
00:02:01,746 --> 00:02:04,541
Says the guy who hasn't seen
the roof of the Rite Aid yet.

45
00:02:06,042 --> 00:02:07,502
Where's the nitrous?

46
00:02:07,585 --> 00:02:10,046
This will not be used
as the conference room?

47
00:02:10,421 --> 00:02:12,841
Uh, no. I had to kind of...
I had to move it,

48
00:02:12,924 --> 00:02:15,009
just, uh, for a couple reasons, actually.

49
00:02:15,093 --> 00:02:17,053
A, I wanted a bigger office.

50
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:21,933
-That feels likeÂ the heart of it.
-Yeah, it is,

51
00:02:22,016 --> 00:02:23,017
-but, uh... Hey.
-Sure.

52
00:02:23,101 --> 00:02:24,310
Check out that view.

53
00:02:24,394 --> 00:02:26,980
Boy, what's a bike tire doing
on the roof of the Rite Aid?

54
00:02:27,272 --> 00:02:29,858
Yeah, that's the $14,000 a month question,
isn't it?

55
00:02:29,941 --> 00:02:32,485
When they said you were the president
of the Bluth Company,

56
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:34,154
I assumed it was in name only.

57
00:02:34,237 --> 00:02:36,739
That they hired you to actually work
seems wrong.

58
00:02:37,073 --> 00:02:39,784
-Do you even know what a mortgage is?
-[laughs]

59
00:02:39,868 --> 00:02:41,953
No, he doesn't. He doesn't know anything.

60
00:02:42,495 --> 00:02:43,329
You do, though.

61
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:45,415
You're the smart Bluth,
I can see it in your eyes.

62
00:02:45,874 --> 00:02:47,000
You read, don't you?

63
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:50,044
Adhir is a holdover
from the Austero Company.

64
00:02:50,128 --> 00:02:51,671
He's our compliant officer.

65
00:02:51,754 --> 00:02:53,631
Or as I like to call him, Chief Worrywart.

66
00:02:53,715 --> 00:02:55,842
-[makes chicken noise]
-It's "compliance officer."

67
00:02:55,925 --> 00:02:59,262
Uh, hey, uh, so you worked
for the Austero Company?

68
00:02:59,345 --> 00:03:01,014
Uh, they forgave a big debt of mine.

69
00:03:01,097 --> 00:03:03,474
How would I get ahold
of Lucille Austero?

70
00:03:03,933 --> 00:03:05,602
[dramatic music plays]

71
00:03:08,897 --> 00:03:11,357
-No one knows, I'm afraid.
-Okay.

72
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:13,276
[G.O.B.] That's it,
go to your office, Adhir.

73
00:03:13,985 --> 00:03:18,072
He's the chief compliant officer,
so he has to do whatever I comply.

74
00:03:18,156 --> 00:03:20,074
-[grunts]
-[Michael] I'm assuming that's

75
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:21,492
where the conference table went.

76
00:03:21,576 --> 00:03:23,286
[G.O.B.] It's probably too big
for that room,

77
00:03:23,369 --> 00:03:26,206
and I would get it out,
but I can't quite remember

78
00:03:26,289 --> 00:03:27,749
how I got it in there.

79
00:03:27,832 --> 00:03:30,001
Like you, I'm about to go underwater,
but before I go,

80
00:03:30,084 --> 00:03:32,503
I'd like to give you some advice:
you're not good at this.

81
00:03:32,587 --> 00:03:34,923
Yeah. I know. But it's important to Dad.

82
00:03:35,006 --> 00:03:36,591
Want to know the thanks I'm getting?

83
00:03:36,674 --> 00:03:38,968
Dad is giving a trophy to Lindsay, not me,

84
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:41,512
for the family of the year
ceremony tonight.

85
00:03:41,596 --> 00:03:42,722
Hm. Great, well,

86
00:03:42,805 --> 00:03:46,142
Dad didn't get a trophy for doing
what you're doing, and he actually did it.

87
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:48,937
[G.O.B.] Well, that's not the worst way
to make Dad love me.

88
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:54,400
I will get a trophy
for Dad, for... something.

89
00:03:54,484 --> 00:03:55,985
-Mm.
-Figure that out later.

90
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:58,071
Dad's never gonna give you
what you're looking for.

91
00:03:58,154 --> 00:04:00,198
And, uh,
maybe that's how it should be.

92
00:04:00,281 --> 00:04:02,659
Maybe when sons grow up,
they're not supposed to be too close

93
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:03,868
to their fathers.

94
00:04:03,952 --> 00:04:06,663
And maybe the best thing
a father can do for his son

95
00:04:06,746 --> 00:04:09,290
is disappear for a while
and let him figure out

96
00:04:09,374 --> 00:04:11,042
what kind of man
he wants to be on his own.

97
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:12,710
At least, that's what I've tried to do.

98
00:04:14,212 --> 00:04:16,881
Then why did you move
into your son's dorm room?

99
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:19,592
That was a year, okay?

100
00:04:19,676 --> 00:04:22,595
And not even a full year,
because I got there at Thanksgiving.

101
00:04:23,137 --> 00:04:25,265
Okay, well, goodbye forever, G.O.B.

102
00:04:25,348 --> 00:04:26,724
I'll be seeing you tonight.

103
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:32,105
[Ron] <i>Michael returned to the model home</i>
<i>to get his scuba equipment.</i>

104
00:04:32,188 --> 00:04:34,274

105
00:04:34,357 --> 00:04:37,610
<i>one last look</i>

106
00:04:38,861 --> 00:04:40,196

It's me, George Michael.

108
00:04:44,325 --> 00:04:45,326
Think fast.

109
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:47,245
Tobias.

110
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:51,874
[in normal voice] Michael.
Yes, well, this is embarrassing.

111
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:54,711
Not only are you finding me
in your son's pants,

112
00:04:54,794 --> 00:04:57,964
but you're also finding out
how the sausage is made. [chuckles]

113
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:00,842
I don't understand a thing you said.

114
00:05:00,925 --> 00:05:04,304
Well, I was doing some character work
for, um,

115
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,515
uh... [grunting]

116
00:05:07,598 --> 00:05:09,434
I'm doing a little character work
to prepare

117
00:05:09,517 --> 00:05:11,227
for the awards ceremony...

118
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:12,270
How did...

119
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:15,606
Why do they only have one...? [pants]

120
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:17,150
Yes-- oh! Uhp!

121
00:05:17,233 --> 00:05:18,651
-Okay, back...
-You all right?

122
00:05:18,735 --> 00:05:20,194
-[sighs]
-Oh! Um...

123
00:05:20,278 --> 00:05:21,446
There you go.

124
00:05:21,529 --> 00:05:23,072
-Just an acting exercise.
-Sure.

125
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:24,741
You're supposed to be George Michael now?

126
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:28,494
Oh, well, it's a character role,
really, and let's face it.

127
00:05:28,911 --> 00:05:30,913
No one was buying me as a straight man.

128
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:32,540
It was a little off-brand.

129
00:05:32,623 --> 00:05:34,334
I'm just trying to find

130
00:05:34,417 --> 00:05:37,003
my place in the Bluth family...

131
00:05:37,211 --> 00:05:39,047
[sighs] ...now that, uh...

132
00:05:40,548 --> 00:05:43,051
Lucille's almost done with me
as her therapist

133
00:05:43,134 --> 00:05:45,470
and Lindsay has...
what does Gwyneth Paltrow say?

134
00:05:45,553 --> 00:05:47,055
"Consciously un-cuckold" me.

135
00:05:47,138 --> 00:05:48,890
You want to stay a part
of the Bluth family?

136
00:05:49,807 --> 00:05:50,683
I have a feeling...

137
00:05:51,976 --> 00:05:53,102
you do, too.

138
00:05:53,478 --> 00:05:55,396
Despite your claims of leaving.

139
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,690
No, no, it's not a claim. I'm leaving.

140
00:05:57,774 --> 00:05:59,025
You always seem to be.

141
00:05:59,108 --> 00:06:00,276
Well, I'm doing it.

142
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,070
I'm gonna map the ocean floor.

143
00:06:03,071 --> 00:06:04,405
Michael, if I could...

144
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:07,116
put my therapist leggings on
for one second.

145
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,243
-Just sit, sit, sit, sit, sit,
-Yeah, sure.

146
00:06:09,327 --> 00:06:12,038
-sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit.
-Tobias, please.

147
00:06:13,456 --> 00:06:14,832
I would just say that

148
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:17,752
you're trying to run away from people
before they have a chance

149
00:06:17,835 --> 00:06:19,837
to run away from you,
because that's what the people

150
00:06:19,921 --> 00:06:21,339
you love do.

151
00:06:21,422 --> 00:06:22,340
Isn't it?

152
00:06:23,174 --> 00:06:24,300
What people?

153
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:25,510
Your wife.

154
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:26,886
-Uh...
-Your son.

155
00:06:27,637 --> 00:06:28,679
Or should I say...

156
00:06:30,181 --> 00:06:31,641
[in a high-pitched voice] ...me?

157
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:33,309
Don't. Uh, you know...

158
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:35,395
-"Why'd Mommy leave, Daddy?"
-Tobias...

159
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:38,940
[in a higher pitch] "I didn't leave.
I loved you bo--" [coughs]

160
00:06:39,023 --> 00:06:40,608
I don't think you want to go there, okay?

161
00:06:40,691 --> 00:06:43,027
Yes, yes, yes. I suppose I did...

162
00:06:43,111 --> 00:06:44,070
start too high.

163
00:06:44,153 --> 00:06:46,155
Okay, let's bring everyone down an octave.

164
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:47,782
-"Why did Mommy leave, Daddy?"
-Tobias...

165
00:06:47,865 --> 00:06:49,826
-"I didn't leave. I loved you both."
-Listen.

166
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:51,869
Tobias, listen,
I don't want you playing my son.

167
00:06:51,953 --> 00:06:55,039
And I'm not confused at all
about what happened to Tracey.

168
00:06:55,123 --> 00:06:58,334
Really?
Because you certainly never talk about it.

169
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:00,336
I was raising a son.
Think I want to burden him

170
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:02,296
with memories
that are gonna make him feel worse?

171
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:06,050
Please. What about Michael's memories?

172
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:10,555
Why can't you go back to the last place
you saw Tracey? Hmm?

173
00:07:10,638 --> 00:07:13,182
-The family beach cottage?
-No, no,

174
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:15,143
I was thinking more, uh, uh,

175
00:07:15,226 --> 00:07:16,727
-metaphorically.
-Yeah.

176
00:07:16,811 --> 00:07:18,938
But that's where we spent
the last months of her life.

177
00:07:19,021 --> 00:07:20,940
And-and after she died,

178
00:07:21,023 --> 00:07:23,401
the family sold that house.

179
00:07:23,484 --> 00:07:25,319
It was one of the kindest things

180
00:07:25,403 --> 00:07:27,280
that-that they ever did for me.

181
00:07:27,363 --> 00:07:29,157
-Do you think that I should go there?
-Uh,

182
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,451
my number one rule is
"don't tell Michael...

183
00:07:33,619 --> 00:07:35,872
what to do."
Now, um, I will say, though,

184
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:37,832
I wish I had known
you'd had such depth

185
00:07:37,915 --> 00:07:40,835
before I gave your part away
to a less experienced actor.

186
00:07:41,502 --> 00:07:43,296
I didn't know there was such a thing.

187
00:07:43,379 --> 00:07:45,214
Get your stuff. We're out of here.

188
00:07:45,673 --> 00:07:47,133
And where are we going, Father?

189
00:07:47,216 --> 00:07:48,926
Nowhere.
I was just practicing the new skit.

190
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:50,761
-[sighs]
-Remember the lineÂ where he says,

191
00:07:50,845 --> 00:07:52,763
-"Get your stuff"?
-I'm improv'ing,

192
00:07:52,847 --> 00:07:54,265
you over-intending schmactor.

193
00:07:54,348 --> 00:07:57,226
This is the simplest character
in the entire family.

194
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:59,187
He has one personality trait:

195
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:00,813
he always comes back.

196
00:08:00,897 --> 00:08:03,024
Well, that and he always has his hands
in his pockets.

197
00:08:03,107 --> 00:08:04,150
You got peanuts in there?

198
00:08:04,609 --> 00:08:06,444
Okay, why am I staying here for this?

199
00:08:07,278 --> 00:08:08,488
Why can't I just be your son?

200
00:08:08,571 --> 00:08:10,573
Oh, there is no son anymore.
He cut the part.

201
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:13,367
And I can't be your father.
I'm not a straight man.

202
00:08:13,451 --> 00:08:16,287
[Ron] <i>Why are </i>we <i>staying here for this?</i>
<i>Anyway, Michael,</i>

203
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:18,915
<i>in his haste to leave town,</i>
<i>arrived at the dock</i>

204
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:21,751
<i>for his ocean floor mapping expedition</i>

205
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:23,836
<i>for what he was certain</i>
<i>was a six-bells departure.</i>

206
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,713
No, we leave at 6:00 p.m.

207
00:08:25,796 --> 00:08:28,216
You telling me we've got a 14-bell delay?

208
00:08:28,299 --> 00:08:30,259
I don't know, man.
But we leave in seven hours.

209
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:31,761
Yeah. Okay.

210
00:08:31,844 --> 00:08:33,596
[Ron] <i>And he was encouraged</i>
<i>to use the time</i>

211
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:36,432
<i>to try out his undersea</i>
<i>camera survey equipment.</i>

212
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:39,685
All right, let's have it.
Great. Look at that, huh?

213
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:41,979
[Ron] <i>And once in the water,</i>
<i>Michael felt like he was</i>

214
00:08:42,063 --> 00:08:45,191
<i>finally able to let go of the past</i>
<i>and forget about</i>

215
00:08:45,274 --> 00:08:47,318
{\an8}<i>everything he was leaving behind.</i>

216
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:52,865
<i>George Michael, meanwhile,</i>
<i>felt no such peace.</i>

217
00:08:53,241 --> 00:08:56,911
<i>Although he was surprised</i>
<i>that his evasive run-in</i> <i>with his father...</i>

218
00:08:56,994 --> 00:08:58,996
There's enough of these
for this to be a thing?

219
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,081
<i>...was less dramatic</i>

220
00:09:00,164 --> 00:09:01,207
<i>than he recalled.</i>

221
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:04,669
<i>And he sought out Maeby</i>
<i>at what she'd said was her new place.</i>

222
00:09:04,752 --> 00:09:06,879
-Hello.
-Looking for a grandparent?

223
00:09:06,963 --> 00:09:09,423
No, thank you. I...
No, I have enough. I'm, uh...

224
00:09:09,507 --> 00:09:11,217
I think I might be at the wrong address.

225
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:13,302
I'm looking for someone
who I cannot imagine meets

226
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:15,888
-your residency requirements here.
-[Maeby] Rose, he's fine.

227
00:09:15,972 --> 00:09:17,348
It's all right. He's with me.

228
00:09:17,431 --> 00:09:19,308
[George Michael] This is
where you're living, a senior center?

229
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:20,893
Yeah, just wait.
Hey, Rose, do you mind?

230
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:22,728
-[lock buzzes]
-Thank you.

231
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:24,480
[Maeby] I needed somewhere
to lay low

232
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:26,232
until the Perfecto thing blew over.

233
00:09:26,315 --> 00:09:29,151
[George Michael] But you said
this place was incredible.

234
00:09:29,819 --> 00:09:31,696
-This is incredible!
-[Maeby] Right?

235
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:34,198
[George Michael] Why is the lobby
so off-putting?

236
00:09:34,282 --> 00:09:36,867
[Maeby] That's what the seniors do
to keep the young people away.

237
00:09:36,951 --> 00:09:38,995
They don't want "dot-commers" taking over.

238
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:41,205
-Nice. Like you and me.
-Exactly.

239
00:09:41,289 --> 00:09:42,957
[George Michael]
How were you able to get in?

240
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,709
[Maeby] When I came back from Mexico,

241
00:09:44,792 --> 00:09:47,253
I found a parking pass
in Lucille 2's Cadillac, right?

242
00:09:47,336 --> 00:09:49,922
And, apparently,
she kept a place for these "trysts"

243
00:09:50,006 --> 00:09:51,882
with old lovers from years ago.

244
00:09:51,966 --> 00:09:53,884
Or they were co-owners or something.

245
00:09:53,968 --> 00:09:55,761
But they just kept it here, empty,

246
00:09:55,845 --> 00:09:57,471
until one of them needed it.

247
00:09:57,555 --> 00:09:59,098
So that was lucky. [chuckles]

248
00:09:59,181 --> 00:10:01,350
I just had to make myself
look older, you know?

249
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:04,437
Yeah, I would think that that'd
be a great use of the gray wig.

250
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,063
No, I went down that road.

251
00:10:06,147 --> 00:10:07,857
[Ron] <i>But wasn't expecting</i>
<i>how upsetting it is</i>

252
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:10,401
<i>to see one's self grown old.</i>

253
00:10:10,484 --> 00:10:12,778
<i>The moment</i>
<i>when a young woman realizes...</i>

254
00:10:12,862 --> 00:10:14,905
[sighs] Oh, my God,
I've become my father.

255
00:10:14,989 --> 00:10:16,949
[Tobias] âª <i>In the most delicious way! </i>âª

256
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:18,451
Oh, so this is a choice.

257
00:10:18,534 --> 00:10:19,785
I didn't want to say anything,

258
00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:22,371
but I was like, "Maeby looks
like a 65-year-old."

259
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:25,207
-What if I told you I was 75? Hmm?
-Holy shit.

260
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:27,668
-You look fantastic.
-Right?

261
00:10:27,752 --> 00:10:30,338
It's the teeth. It's the same guy
who's doing my meth teeth,

262
00:10:30,421 --> 00:10:32,298
you know,
for the family of the year thing.

263
00:10:32,381 --> 00:10:35,384
Where I write a speech for my mom,
she talks about how great I am, then...

264
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:37,053
Then you open your mouth
and you're like,

265
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:39,221
"So why do I have to turn tricks
for meth money?"

266
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:41,474
I don't know how you keep
all your scams straight.

267
00:10:41,557 --> 00:10:44,560
Well, this old lady one is a big,
big score.

268
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:48,230
I mean, when people catch on,
they either forget or they die.

269
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:50,941
[chuckles] And, I mean,
this place is a dream.

270
00:10:51,025 --> 00:10:52,443
Nobody even locks their doors.

271
00:10:52,526 --> 00:10:54,987
Of course,
what is there to steal? [chuckles]

272
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:57,156
A few barstools and some family pictures?

273
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:02,161
Anyway, that's how I got those barstools
and all these great pictures of grandkids.

274
00:11:02,787 --> 00:11:04,914
-What a beautiful family you've stolen.
-Mm.

275
00:11:04,997 --> 00:11:07,917
What are you gonna do if Lucille 2
or the friend she owns this with shows up?

276
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,669
He kind of already has.

277
00:11:10,461 --> 00:11:12,713
[Ron] <i>Maeby had only been</i>
<i>in the place for a week</i>

278
00:11:12,797 --> 00:11:16,634
<i>and had spent most of that time</i>
<i>trying to trap a swan in her condo...</i>

279
00:11:16,717 --> 00:11:18,010
What's your problem? It's tuna.

280
00:11:18,094 --> 00:11:19,762
<i>...when she came across a stranger,</i>

281
00:11:19,845 --> 00:11:22,098
<i>whom longtime viewers</i>
<i>will be mildly surprised</i>

282
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:24,850
<i>-to recognize is Stan Sitwell.</i>
-Hello.

283
00:11:24,934 --> 00:11:26,602
-[Ron] <i>But whom Maeby did not.</i>
-Hello.

284
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:28,020
Do you live in one of these?

285
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:30,272
-This one's mine, yes.
-Well, that's strange.

286
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:32,983
Do you realize this condo
is listed as Lucille Austero's?

287
00:11:33,275 --> 00:11:34,819
Yes. I am her.

288
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:37,363
Sister.

289
00:11:37,822 --> 00:11:39,281
-I am her sister.
-[swan honks]

290
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:40,616
You're going the wrong way.

291
00:11:41,117 --> 00:11:41,951
Annette?

292
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:43,744
Great idea. Do you think they have one?

293
00:11:43,828 --> 00:11:44,745
Have what?

294
00:11:45,287 --> 00:11:47,456
Annette. Yes, that's me.

295
00:11:47,832 --> 00:11:49,750
[chuckles] And you are?

296
00:11:49,834 --> 00:11:53,003
Stan. I must admit,
I'm a little confused right now.

297
00:11:53,087 --> 00:11:56,716
Our agreement was that this place
would revert back to me once Lucille...

298
00:11:57,133 --> 00:11:59,385
[dramatic music plays]

299
00:11:59,468 --> 00:12:00,344
[honking]

300
00:12:02,596 --> 00:12:04,432
...gave up her interest.

301
00:12:05,182 --> 00:12:07,351
Well, I don't know anything about that.

302
00:12:07,435 --> 00:12:09,311
She signed it over to me.

303
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:11,397
I'd like to see that paperwork.

304
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:13,607
Yes.

305
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:16,652
Well, I recently moved here
from New Orleans,

306
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:20,197
-and I...
-[Ron] <i>Maeby was proud of this lie.</i>

307
00:12:20,281 --> 00:12:23,701
...lost all my personal paperwork
in Hurricane Cantina.

308
00:12:24,702 --> 00:12:26,620
Ooh. That's complicated.

309
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:29,081
Yes. It is.

310
00:12:29,623 --> 00:12:32,376
Unless I'm expected to lose a home
for the second time.

311
00:12:33,544 --> 00:12:37,006
Of course, I could just pack up
my shorty shorts,

312
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:39,717
my silky pajamas, my peekaboo bras,

313
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:42,595
my ticklers, sex knobs, and lacy hoo-has

314
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:44,054
and hit the road.

315
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:46,432
I can't ask you to do that.

316
00:12:46,515 --> 00:12:47,850
[George Michael] <i>This place is yours?</i>

317
00:12:47,933 --> 00:12:50,269
Not yet, but maybe I'll kick him out
sooner than later.

318
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:53,439
Maybe I'll kick him out
once he gets off that goddamn chair.

319
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:55,399
[George Michael] That's him?

320
00:12:55,483 --> 00:12:57,276
-[Maeby] Yeah.
-Why aren't we whispering?

321
00:12:57,568 --> 00:12:58,736
Oh. He can't hear a thing.

322
00:12:58,819 --> 00:13:01,113
-He's got horrible aids.

Oh, hearing aids.

325
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,076
Yeah, yeah, here they call them aids.

326
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,287
The other ones they call
[whispers] aids.

327
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:11,624
Don't worry, if he asks who you are,
I'll just tell him you're Tom Collins.

328
00:13:11,707 --> 00:13:13,751
He's always asking for a Tom Collins.

329
00:13:13,834 --> 00:13:16,879
Believe me, I'm in over my head enough
as it is being George Maharis.

330
00:13:16,962 --> 00:13:18,464
Which is what I wanted to talk
to you about.

331
00:13:18,547 --> 00:13:21,175
So I told my Dad
that I was still dating Rebel.

332
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:23,928
What? Why'd you do that?

333
00:13:24,011 --> 00:13:25,638
You told me to do it. It was your idea.

334
00:13:25,721 --> 00:13:27,598
-Mm-mm.
-I mean, I still haven't even seen her

335
00:13:27,681 --> 00:13:29,183
-since I punched him.
-No, no, no.

336
00:13:29,266 --> 00:13:32,603
I told you that your dad
is still in love with Rebel.

337
00:13:33,062 --> 00:13:35,606
And that telling him you haven't seen her
would be more hurtful.

338
00:13:35,689 --> 00:13:38,317
You perverted that
into a way to not hurt him.

339
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:41,028
And then I had to turn down
this scuba trip, which is also rude,

340
00:13:41,111 --> 00:13:42,780
and if he finds out he's gonna say,

341
00:13:42,863 --> 00:13:45,241
"You lied to me, George Michael,
and that's worse."

342
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:47,243
You know he's gonna say
"and that's worse."

343
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:50,287
You would've had to lie about scuba,
'cause you would've been scared.

344
00:13:50,371 --> 00:13:52,414
Why do you say I'm scared of scuba?
I'm not.

345
00:13:53,082 --> 00:13:54,583
You passed out at the aquarium.

346
00:13:55,543 --> 00:13:58,671
They make you feel like you're underwater
with all these giant...

347
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:01,757
-Dolphins?
-I think that was some kind of smiling,

348
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:03,884
kind of bemused baby shark.

349
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:05,678
I don't know, things are volatile

350
00:14:05,761 --> 00:14:07,763
with my dad right now.
It feels very combustible.

351
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:10,850
Feels like we're on the edge of
physical menace or something,

352
00:14:10,933 --> 00:14:14,478
which I've trained myself for,
but has he been training, too?

353
00:14:14,562 --> 00:14:15,813
What was that in the hallway?

354
00:14:15,896 --> 00:14:17,857
Look. Here's my advice. Okay?

355
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:19,149
You go to Rebel's,

356
00:14:19,233 --> 00:14:21,652
you take my bag of lacy ticklers,
hoo-ha bras, dog toys,

357
00:14:21,735 --> 00:14:22,903
and sex knobs with you.

358
00:14:22,987 --> 00:14:25,114
And you act like you're expecting
a booty call,

359
00:14:25,197 --> 00:14:27,157
as the old people think
the young people say.

360
00:14:27,241 --> 00:14:29,076
All right?
You tell her, "I'm here for a quickie,

361
00:14:29,159 --> 00:14:30,202
and I'm out of here."

362
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:33,622
Mr. Brash.
And she'll drop you like a buttered cane.

363
00:14:34,248 --> 00:14:36,792
-Something old people say?
-Yeah. I'm trying to get it going.

364
00:14:37,835 --> 00:14:39,837
-That's cool.
-[Ron] <i>George Michael's father</i>

365
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,089
<i>had drifted farther south</i>
<i>than he realized,</i>

366
00:14:42,923 --> 00:14:44,717
<i>despite swimming with a GPS system</i>

367
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,970
<i>that cost roughly as much</i>
<i>as Buster's left thumb.</i>

368
00:14:48,512 --> 00:14:50,639
<i>And he soon found himself</i>

369
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:53,475
<i>on a part of the beach he hadn't been to</i>
<i>in over 20 years.</i>

370
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:56,061
[panting]

371
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:59,231
âª <i>I'm coming home </i>âª

372
00:14:59,315 --> 00:15:01,317
âª <i>Home, homeÂ </i>âª

373
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:03,777
I love that house.

374
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:07,865
Yeah.<i> </i>My family used to own it
back in the '80s.

375
00:15:07,948 --> 00:15:10,034
[woman] Too bad they sold it,
it's worth a fortune now.

376
00:15:10,117 --> 00:15:11,285
My wife died there.

377
00:15:11,368 --> 00:15:13,662
Ovarian cancer, actually.

378
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:15,289
-[woman] He's a liar.
-And...

379
00:15:15,372 --> 00:15:16,957
He shouldn't have said that.

380
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:18,959
-[woman] Ignore the man.
-Good to see you.

381
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:24,965
[Ron] <i>And Michael decided that</i>
<i>perhaps Tobias was right.</i>

382
00:15:25,507 --> 00:15:28,302
<i>Perhaps he did need to look the grim truth</i>

383
00:15:28,385 --> 00:15:31,347
<i>of mortality... in the face.</i>

384
00:15:33,057 --> 00:15:35,351
Oh shit, he found out.

385
00:15:40,147 --> 00:15:41,941
[Ron] <i>Michael had just discovered</i>

386
00:15:42,024 --> 00:15:44,318
<i>his family never sold</i>
<i>their family cottage.</i>

387
00:15:44,401 --> 00:15:46,695
...lied to me, and that's worse.

388
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:49,698
I am stunned. I just--
I literally said<i> </i>it would be so great

389
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:51,742
if my family had kept the cottage.

390
00:15:51,825 --> 00:15:52,826
We did.

391
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:54,745
I know. You shouldn't have.

392
00:15:54,828 --> 00:15:56,413
Well, then either way, you're unhappy.

393
00:15:56,872 --> 00:15:58,165
I mean, pick a lane.

394
00:15:58,499 --> 00:16:00,626
You pick... you pick a lane.

395
00:16:00,709 --> 00:16:02,252
What did you want us to do, Michael?

396
00:16:02,336 --> 00:16:04,797
It was a horrible time
for the housing market.

397
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:07,841
Were we supposed to lose
our precious daughter-in-law

398
00:16:07,925 --> 00:16:10,135
and a couple hundred grand
in the same year?

399
00:16:10,219 --> 00:16:13,097
-Why didn't you just tell me?
-Because we love you.

400
00:16:13,764 --> 00:16:16,266
-And nobody wanted your feelings hurt.
-Mm.

401
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:18,227
-That was rule one.
-Rule one?

402
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:21,105
[Lucille] It slipped down a little
when we put in the new floors.

403
00:16:21,188 --> 00:16:23,440
And by that point, you were already dating

404
00:16:23,524 --> 00:16:26,026
and in love with that total re--

405
00:16:27,444 --> 00:16:29,822
that totally lovely Rita.

406
00:16:29,905 --> 00:16:31,740
Uh, she was a smart cookie, that one.

407
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:32,992
Nice try, Mom.

408
00:16:33,075 --> 00:16:36,286
And we didn't want to bring up
those bad old memories.

409
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:39,289
Besides, this place already
has enough bad ones for me.

410
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41,333
My mother died here.

411
00:16:42,126 --> 00:16:43,794
G.O.B. was born here.

412
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:45,838
And I'm sure you've heard,

413
00:16:45,921 --> 00:16:47,881
it was also your father's [bleeps] pad.

414
00:16:47,965 --> 00:16:49,717
Only from the next room.

415
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:52,594
Please believe me,
if I could turn back time,

416
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:54,596
-I never would've answered that door.
-I know.

417
00:16:55,806 --> 00:16:57,558
Were you slightly worried

418
00:16:57,641 --> 00:17:00,269
that I might come out here one day, Mom?

419
00:17:00,811 --> 00:17:03,522
H-Honestly, I never thought
you'd get past the guard gate.

420
00:17:03,605 --> 00:17:06,066
I could barely get past them
when Tobias and I got here.

421
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:08,402
Tobias.
He's the one that put coming out here

422
00:17:08,485 --> 00:17:10,988
-in my mind in the first place.
-He what?

423
00:17:11,071 --> 00:17:13,699
-[Tobias] As a metaphor.
-You're out!

424
00:17:13,782 --> 00:17:15,659
But I've already pinked away my sideburns

425
00:17:15,743 --> 00:17:18,787
to play Buster at the family of the year
ceremony tonight.

426
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:20,539
And Buster's already invited a date.

427
00:17:20,622 --> 00:17:23,917
[imitating Buster] Come out
and meet your boyfriend, Lucille.

428
00:17:24,334 --> 00:17:26,295
-[indistinct chatter]
-[Tobias clears throat]

429
00:17:26,378 --> 00:17:28,005
-Murph?
-[muttering]

430
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:32,009
Oh, I see you finally figured out
how to use that contraption.

431
00:17:32,092 --> 00:17:33,093
I'm on the phone.

432
00:17:33,177 --> 00:17:34,428
-Just one second.
-What?

433
00:17:34,595 --> 00:17:35,846
I'm talking on the phone.

434
00:17:35,929 --> 00:17:37,264
Who are you talking to?

435
00:17:37,347 --> 00:17:39,850
Didn't you tell me I was supposed
to be busting with my girlfriend?

436
00:17:39,933 --> 00:17:42,311
I said, you're Buster's girlfriend.

437
00:17:42,853 --> 00:17:43,896
Oh. Hang on.

438
00:17:44,646 --> 00:17:45,856
Wait. Wait.

439
00:17:45,939 --> 00:17:48,984
-Am I supposed-- Am I your boyfriend?
-No!

440
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:51,862
You are-- I'm-- A girl.

441
00:17:52,362 --> 00:17:55,407
You're a girl, Linds,
uh, Murphy B-- Lucille.

442
00:17:55,491 --> 00:17:58,786
-Is he supposed to be me?
-Uh-uh-uh, Lucille Number 2.

443
00:17:58,869 --> 00:18:00,871
She's quite the grande dame.

444
00:18:00,954 --> 00:18:03,457
It's basically Michael
without the peanut pockets.

445
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:06,001
You know,
you're playing her like you played

446
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:08,212
that stammering mess of a Buster,
and it won't do.

447
00:18:08,295 --> 00:18:12,007
Sometimes I don't even think
that you want to be an actor.

448
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:15,302
Actually, sometimes,
I think I want to be a dog doctor. Ow!

449
00:18:15,385 --> 00:18:17,554
[Tobias] This is the role of a lifetime.

450
00:18:17,638 --> 00:18:18,931
Now, I know 50 gentlemen

451
00:18:19,014 --> 00:18:21,475
who would tuck their last nut
to play this part.

452
00:18:21,558 --> 00:18:24,186
Okay?
Now, he saves it for the day.

453
00:18:24,269 --> 00:18:27,731
When you see him at the campaign event,
you'll think you're looking at

454
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:31,985
a 72-year-old pink mustachioed
Lucille Austero.

455
00:18:32,069 --> 00:18:35,697
-We can't have Lucille Austero!
-We can't have Lucille Austero.

456
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:37,533
She's running against Lindsay,
for God's sake.

457
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:38,534
[Tobias] For God's sake.

458
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:40,702
I don't even know why I'm having
this conversation.

459
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:43,122
You're out!
We don't even need a Buster.

460
00:18:43,705 --> 00:18:45,666
Well, at least you're being honest
about that.

461
00:18:45,749 --> 00:18:47,459
So you admit you've got Buster.

462
00:18:47,543 --> 00:18:50,754
This again?
Why would I hide Buster from you?

463
00:18:50,838 --> 00:18:52,589
You want me to think that he's missing.

464
00:18:52,673 --> 00:18:54,633
You're trying to teach me a lesson.
You're tryingÂ to get even

465
00:18:54,716 --> 00:18:56,135
because I'm trying to teach...

466
00:18:57,177 --> 00:18:58,595
I don't know why you're trying

467
00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:00,889
to teach me a lesson,
so lesson not learned, Mother.

468
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:02,641
Michael, did you do something

469
00:19:02,724 --> 00:19:05,144
for which we should be
teaching you a lesson?

470
00:19:05,227 --> 00:19:06,645
-[banging]
-[man] Mother!

471
00:19:10,232 --> 00:19:12,109
He's here, isn't he?

472
00:19:12,192 --> 00:19:13,652
Tell me he's not in that bedroom,

473
00:19:13,735 --> 00:19:15,279
-not where Tracey...
-Don't go in there.

474
00:19:15,362 --> 00:19:16,405
...spent her last...

475
00:19:17,948 --> 00:19:18,991
[clicks tongue]

476
00:19:19,074 --> 00:19:20,909
Oh, someone told Michael.

477
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:23,412
Does this mean we can start leaving towels
on the floor?

478
00:19:23,495 --> 00:19:24,705
What are you doing?

479
00:19:24,788 --> 00:19:27,249
I'm making this into a trophy for Dad.

480
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:29,042
I can't wait to see
the one you got yourself.

481
00:19:29,126 --> 00:19:30,919
Uh, yeah, Michael. [scoffs] Please.

482
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:33,630
I'm the president or CEO
or whatever of the Bluth Company.

483
00:19:33,714 --> 00:19:35,966
I control the company checkbook,
so I don't need

484
00:19:36,049 --> 00:19:38,802
false things to make me feel important.

485
00:19:38,886 --> 00:19:40,971
-Okay.
-There's no trophy for that.

486
00:19:41,054 --> 00:19:42,472
[Ron] <i>Although he did visit</i>

487
00:19:42,556 --> 00:19:45,475
<i>-a trophy store earlier that day.</i>
-It's a good time to be in this business.

488
00:19:46,101 --> 00:19:47,811
Everyone gets a trophy.

489
00:19:47,895 --> 00:19:49,730
I tell people to stay away
from the business.

490
00:19:50,147 --> 00:19:52,232
It's always been a lousy business,
and these days

491
00:19:52,316 --> 00:19:54,151
-everybody shops online.
-Everybody gets a trophy.

492
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:56,361
A trophy, huh? Yeah.

493
00:19:56,862 --> 00:19:58,780
Well, that may be, but tell me this,

494
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:02,284
how many people get a whole [bleeps]
trophy store?

495
00:20:04,161 --> 00:20:05,245
Oh, yeah.

496
00:20:06,496 --> 00:20:07,956
You can't be serious.

497
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:10,000
So the guy was like,
"Are you shitting me?"

498
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:12,836
That's usually the sign
that you've made yourself a great deal.

499
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:17,090
So, I told him, "I'm gonna need you
to cobble together one last trophy,

500
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:19,259
old trophy cobbler,

501
00:20:19,343 --> 00:20:21,595
for the family of the year
ceremony tonight."

502
00:20:21,678 --> 00:20:24,973
And I said, "I want you to find
the biggest golden anchor you can find."

503
00:20:26,016 --> 00:20:27,476
So they didn't have one of those?

504
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:29,436
No, he didn't even have keys
to the back room.

505
00:20:29,519 --> 00:20:31,396
Also, the heat doesn't turn off.

506
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,649
This took a couple hours,
so once I give this to Dad,

507
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:36,902
then I'll have Joni Beard
give me the deed to the trophy store.

508
00:20:36,985 --> 00:20:39,071
-Wait till you see it!
-[spray paint can hisses]

509
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:42,407
I'm not gonna be there. Oh, uh...

510
00:20:42,491 --> 00:20:45,160
let me ask you a question,
and I want you to be honest with me.

511
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:48,038
Are you doing something with Busty?

512
00:20:48,121 --> 00:20:51,124
[Ron] <i>Michael was referring</i>
<i>to his missing brother, Buster.</i>

513
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:55,045
<i>But G.O.B., who hadn't been with a woman</i>
<i>since he'd gotten closer to this man...</i>

514
00:20:55,128 --> 00:20:57,130
I was wondering what
you were going to pop out of.

515
00:20:57,214 --> 00:20:58,840
<i>-...I mean this one...</i>
<i>-VÃ¡monos.</i>

516
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:03,637
<i>...thought that "Busty"</i>
<i>was referring to this woman...</i>

517
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,013
Where's the nitrous?

518
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:07,516
<i>...whom he really hadn't done</i>
<i>much fooling with at all.</i>

519
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:09,101
<i>Which is why he answered...</i>

520
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:12,229
<i>-eventually...</i>
<i>-</i>Yes.

521
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,900
[Michael] Got my answer.

522
00:21:17,025 --> 00:21:19,486
You really don't care
about your children's feelings, do you?

523
00:21:19,569 --> 00:21:21,405
Oh, you're one to give parenting lessons.

524
00:21:21,488 --> 00:21:24,992
I hear I'm not the only one
whose son has a nasty left hook.

525
00:21:25,409 --> 00:21:27,035
Hmm, yeah, well...

526
00:21:27,661 --> 00:21:29,246
You know, at least he did something

527
00:21:29,329 --> 00:21:30,789
that we have not been able to do.

528
00:21:30,872 --> 00:21:32,874
He stood up for himself
when his father was wrong.

529
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:34,584
In fact, it might be the thing

530
00:21:34,668 --> 00:21:36,295
that I'm most proud of him for.

531
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:37,504
Hope he knows that.

532
00:21:37,587 --> 00:21:39,381
Uh, he definitely does not.

533
00:21:40,716 --> 00:21:42,092
-What's that?
-I just saw him--

534
00:21:42,175 --> 00:21:45,220
uh, heard him, rather-- at the model home
when I was on my way out.

535
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:47,639
-George Michael's at the model home?
<i>-</i>Well, if it wasn't him,

536
00:21:47,723 --> 00:21:49,182
it was somebody who certainly did

537
00:21:49,266 --> 00:21:53,061
a heck of a lot better
impression of him than me. [laughs]

538
00:21:53,812 --> 00:21:56,231
-Well, that could be anyone.
-Well, well...

539
00:21:58,191 --> 00:21:59,526
Goodbye forever.

540
00:21:59,609 --> 00:22:00,485
See you tonight.

541
00:22:00,569 --> 00:22:02,904
-See you tonight.
-[Michael] See you tonight.

542
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:06,116
[Ron] <i>So, Michael changed</i>
<i>and raced to the model home.</i>

543
00:22:06,199 --> 00:22:08,243
<i>But his hopes for an emotional</i>

544
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:09,286
<i>-father-son reunion...</i>
-Hey.

545
00:22:09,369 --> 00:22:12,080
I'm sorry if things got, uh...
Are you crying? Hey.

546
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:13,206
<i>...were ruined...</i>

547
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:14,374
-Hey.
-[Michael] Oh.

548
00:22:14,458 --> 00:22:16,710
<i>...by an emotional father-son reunion.</i>

549
00:22:16,793 --> 00:22:17,836
Tonight's the big night.

550
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:19,421
Family of the year day.

551
00:22:19,504 --> 00:22:21,340
What are you doing
in George Michael's bed?

552
00:22:21,423 --> 00:22:24,217
Oh... just a little...

553
00:22:24,593 --> 00:22:27,137
[sniffles] ...just a little
weep and sleep, you know.

554
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:28,263
-Uh-huh.
-Yeah.

555
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:29,806
Want to be the big man, so...

556
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:33,477
Can't do it at the office, obviously,
and Lindsay's at the penthouse,

557
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:35,103
and I can't go to the cot...

558
00:22:35,729 --> 00:22:38,774
Well, we don't... We only...
we only have the penthouse,

559
00:22:38,857 --> 00:22:40,359
-so I-I, uh, I came here.
-Mmm.

560
00:22:40,442 --> 00:22:41,735
I know about the cottage.

561
00:22:41,818 --> 00:22:43,403
-I hated that rule.
-Okay.

562
00:22:43,487 --> 00:22:44,946
-Michael?
-Hmm.

563
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:47,157
-I hated <i>both </i>rules.
-Oh, yeah, the towels.

564
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:48,492
Can I ask you a question?

565
00:22:48,575 --> 00:22:50,118
How'd you get past the guard gate?

566
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:51,661
I came from the water.

567
00:22:52,537 --> 00:22:55,457
I knew it. I told her. I told her,
"He's gonna take us from the beach."

568
00:22:56,249 --> 00:22:57,834
Well, I am glad. I am glad you did.

569
00:22:58,293 --> 00:23:00,629
Yeah, it's just your mother and her rules.

570
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:04,049
And I hated "no sand in the living room."

571
00:23:04,132 --> 00:23:05,675
[voice breaking]
Why have a beach house

572
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:08,387
if every member of the family
can't enjoy it?

573
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:10,722
You look like
you're not enjoying anything.

574
00:23:10,806 --> 00:23:11,973
-You all right?
-Yeah.

575
00:23:12,057 --> 00:23:13,475
Your mom and I are...

576
00:23:13,558 --> 00:23:15,394
[clears throat] We're not together.

577
00:23:15,477 --> 00:23:17,062
We're not together in the...

578
00:23:17,145 --> 00:23:19,564
well, I guess in, uh,
every meaning of that word.

579
00:23:19,648 --> 00:23:22,275
I assumed that, but, uh,
why aren't you enjoying that?

580
00:23:22,359 --> 00:23:25,904
Because your mom
is being courted, Michael.

581
00:23:27,197 --> 00:23:28,615
Someone is fawning all over her.

582
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:31,076
-I knew she had Buster.
-No.

583
00:23:31,159 --> 00:23:33,161
-I knew it.
-This one's not Buster.

584
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:35,330
I mean, I wish that guy was Buster.

585
00:23:35,414 --> 00:23:37,833
Him I could fight, you know? You see,

586
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:39,334
this guy got past me.

587
00:23:39,418 --> 00:23:41,670
How can your mother do this to me?

588
00:23:41,753 --> 00:23:43,964
I knew I should've sold that property

589
00:23:44,047 --> 00:23:45,006
when Stacy died.

590
00:23:45,841 --> 00:23:47,134
Tracey.

591
00:23:47,217 --> 00:23:48,802
No, we would've lost a fortune

592
00:23:48,885 --> 00:23:51,263
if we sold when Tracey died.

593
00:23:51,346 --> 00:23:53,932
No, Stacy was the paralegal
I used to bring out there

594
00:23:54,015 --> 00:23:55,267
who went into insulin shock

595
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:57,394
at the very height of the market.

596
00:23:58,061 --> 00:23:58,895
Sad.

597
00:23:58,979 --> 00:24:00,355
How can she do this to me?

598
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:01,606
-[crying]
-Yeah.

599
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:03,275
How can your mother do this?

600
00:24:03,358 --> 00:24:05,819
[Ron] <i>Actually,</i>
<i>she hadn't done anything yet.</i>

601
00:24:05,902 --> 00:24:08,905
<i>But a few weeks earlier at the cottage...</i>

602
00:24:08,989 --> 00:24:12,325
When my daughter wins this election,
we're going to be wall-to-wall wall.

603
00:24:12,409 --> 00:24:13,827
<i>ZÃ ijiÃ n.</i>

604
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:16,872
<i>...a nuisance washed up</i>
<i>on her beach.</i>

605
00:24:16,955 --> 00:24:18,123
You know, I smashed my phone

606
00:24:18,206 --> 00:24:20,208
a couple years ago, too. With a hammer.

607
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:21,626
Never missed it.

608
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:24,004
Miss the hammer, but I guess that's why

609
00:24:24,087 --> 00:24:25,380
God made rocks.

610
00:24:25,464 --> 00:24:26,798
But God made those rocks

611
00:24:26,882 --> 00:24:28,967
and put them
in front of my cottage for me,

612
00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:30,635
so let's just leave them there.

613
00:24:31,178 --> 00:24:32,804
I know the law pretty well,

614
00:24:32,888 --> 00:24:34,681
and I can pick up any rock I want.

615
00:24:34,764 --> 00:24:37,934
Well, what do you use those for,
anyway, Sand Hippie?

616
00:24:38,018 --> 00:24:39,728
-Making a yoga garden?
-No.

617
00:24:39,811 --> 00:24:42,189
I throw 'em at people that got no business

618
00:24:42,272 --> 00:24:43,940
being on this part of the beach.

619
00:24:44,024 --> 00:24:45,901
[Ron] <i>He had done so for years...</i>

620
00:24:45,984 --> 00:24:48,361
{\an8}<i>Van Halen was in town</i>
<i>this weekend rocking audiences.</i>

621
00:24:48,445 --> 00:24:51,281
{\an8}<i>But some beachgoers are getting</i>
<i>rocked in a different way</i>

622
00:24:51,364 --> 00:24:54,576
{\an8}<i>by a group calling themselves</i>
<i>the Newport Bay Boys.</i>

623
00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:57,412
[Ron] <i>...in what started</i>
<i>as a cool, rich kid surfer gang</i>

624
00:24:57,496 --> 00:24:58,788
<i>that had been possessive</i>

625
00:24:58,872 --> 00:25:01,333
<i>about Newport's most beautiful cove...</i>

626
00:25:01,416 --> 00:25:03,418
{\an8}<i>Nirvana was in town</i>
<i>this weekend rocking audiences.</i>

627
00:25:03,502 --> 00:25:06,755
{\an8}<i>But some beachgoers are getting rocked</i>
<i>in a different way...</i>

628
00:25:06,838 --> 00:25:08,048
[Ron] <i>...and became a group</i>

629
00:25:08,131 --> 00:25:10,675
<i>of kind of hip, middle-aged surfer men</i>

630
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:12,302
<i>defending their coastline.</i>

631
00:25:12,385 --> 00:25:15,055
{\an8}<i>50 Cent was in town</i>
<i>this weekend rocking audiences,</i>

632
00:25:15,138 --> 00:25:18,517
{\an8}<i>but some beachgoers are getting rocked</i>
<i>in a different way.</i>

633
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,810
I think we're good, guys. They're gone.

634
00:25:21,311 --> 00:25:22,479
Yeah, they're gone.

635
00:25:22,562 --> 00:25:23,813
I'm Dusty.

636
00:25:23,897 --> 00:25:25,398
[Lucille] That's a nice way to say it.

637
00:25:25,482 --> 00:25:27,484
But let's not make a habit of this,
shall we?

638
00:25:27,817 --> 00:25:29,528
Now, take your bucket full of rocks

639
00:25:29,611 --> 00:25:30,779
and be gone.

640
00:25:30,862 --> 00:25:32,989
[Ron] <i>But a habit of it he did make.</i>

641
00:25:54,469 --> 00:25:55,470
Hey!

642
00:25:55,554 --> 00:25:58,390
Get off my beach, you stupid seagulls.

643
00:25:59,474 --> 00:26:00,475
Oh, hi.

644
00:26:01,059 --> 00:26:03,603
Care to join me
for a glass of breakfast wine?

645
00:26:03,687 --> 00:26:06,064
[Ron] <i>And before long,</i>
<i>they were in the first stages</i>

646
00:26:06,147 --> 00:26:07,440
<i>of a beautiful</i>

647
00:26:07,524 --> 00:26:10,902
<i>early October-late November</i>
<i>relationship.</i>

648
00:26:12,904 --> 00:26:14,281
I mean, he's attracted to her.

649
00:26:14,364 --> 00:26:16,116
He's attracted to her.

650
00:26:16,741 --> 00:26:19,286
I'm sorry. Why would he be
attracted to her if he's blind?

651
00:26:19,369 --> 00:26:21,705
And how did he burn off his fingertips?

652
00:26:22,289 --> 00:26:23,999
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

653
00:26:24,082 --> 00:26:26,334
I may have added the fingertips.

654
00:26:26,418 --> 00:26:28,378
I assume if he's blind,
he's gotta feel her face.

655
00:26:28,461 --> 00:26:30,380
But you said you never saw him
touch her face?

656
00:26:30,463 --> 00:26:31,881
I never said he was blind.

657
00:26:31,965 --> 00:26:34,009
Look, I'm sure it's nothing.
It's probably just

658
00:26:34,092 --> 00:26:36,803
some harmless one-way flirting.
You know, or a Russian prank show.

659
00:26:36,886 --> 00:26:38,972
Maybe I deserve it, you know,

660
00:26:39,055 --> 00:26:40,432
'cause I can't, uh...

661
00:26:40,515 --> 00:26:42,892
I can't deliver the goods. [sighs]

662
00:26:42,976 --> 00:26:44,519
I shouldn't have lied to you, Michael.

663
00:26:44,603 --> 00:26:45,604
I'm not one to judge.

664
00:26:45,687 --> 00:26:48,523
You know, look, I just...
I just told my son

665
00:26:48,607 --> 00:26:50,442
that I broke up
with the woman that he's seeing,

666
00:26:50,525 --> 00:26:51,610
and in retrospect,

667
00:26:51,693 --> 00:26:53,695
I don't know, maybe she did not hear

668
00:26:53,778 --> 00:26:57,073
"I'm leaving" when I said, uh,
"I ain't going nowhere."

669
00:26:57,157 --> 00:26:59,242
Sounds like a "goodbye forever" to me.

670
00:26:59,326 --> 00:27:02,537
Right? But if she tells my son,
uh, what I said,

671
00:27:02,621 --> 00:27:04,414
you know what he's gonna say.

672
00:27:04,497 --> 00:27:06,333
Uh, "You lied, and that's worse."

673
00:27:06,416 --> 00:27:09,169
Yeah, you know, they can't wait
to say stuff like that.

674
00:27:09,252 --> 00:27:11,004
Mm-hmm. Well,

675
00:27:11,087 --> 00:27:13,798
I gotta tell her that that's
the last she's gonna see of me.

676
00:27:13,882 --> 00:27:16,301
Yeah. I mean,
at least it won't destroy her life

677
00:27:16,384 --> 00:27:17,677
like your mother did mine.

678
00:27:17,761 --> 00:27:19,554
Yep. You gonna be okay here?

679
00:27:20,513 --> 00:27:22,724
-I ain't going nowhere.
-Perfect.

680
00:27:25,101 --> 00:27:27,270

00:27:30,523 --> 00:27:31,775
