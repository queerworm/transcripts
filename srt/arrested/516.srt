-Right.

[Michael] <i>So, you thought</i>

17
00:00:50,925 --> 00:00:52,761
Mimi was talking about you.

18
00:00:52,844 --> 00:00:55,680
That-- That you were her child,
and that she was gonna take you away.

19
00:00:55,764 --> 00:00:58,308
Well, had I known
that she was talking about Lindsay,

20
00:00:58,391 --> 00:01:00,393
I would have been, like,
"Goodbye, Felicia."

21
00:01:00,685 --> 00:01:04,481
I didn't even really get close to her
until we made soup that one time.

22
00:01:04,814 --> 00:01:07,233
Is it true?
Did you push Mimi down the stairs?

23
00:01:08,193 --> 00:01:11,404
I did, but nothing's gonna happen to me
'cause I'm just a boy.

24
00:01:13,573 --> 00:01:14,949
How come you never said anything?

25
00:01:15,033 --> 00:01:17,452
-How come Mom never told--
-You leave Mother out of this.

26
00:01:17,535 --> 00:01:19,454
-She knows nothing.
-Why are you protecting her?

27
00:01:19,537 --> 00:01:20,997
What are you not telling me?

28
00:01:21,331 --> 00:01:23,708
I did it,

30
00:01:26,336 --> 00:01:29,714

Do not protect Mother.

31
00:01:29,798 --> 00:01:33,176
This looks very, very bad.
You know, Lottie is gonna make it look

32
00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:36,012
like you're one of those guys
that pushes old ladies down stairs.

33
00:01:36,262 --> 00:01:39,599
Lottie. She's so mean.
I wish I could shove her down the st--

34
00:01:39,682 --> 00:01:41,643
Hey! Shh! No more talking
about shoving, pushing--

35
00:01:41,726 --> 00:01:43,353
-[guard] No touching!
-Or touching.

36

-Yeah, feel it. It's a rental.
-Let's focus on your defense.

-What I saw today in court...

39
00:01:51,986 --> 00:01:53,571

Just for seven years.
Then we'll let you age out.

64
00:02:58,261 --> 00:03:01,806

-your pal Tony Wonder.
-[Ron]<i> ...who threatened</i>

[Ron] <i>Gob kept this part from Buster,</i>

70

[Buster] Um, it was given to me,

71

But Dusty thinks we're
better off just ignoring it.

72
00:03:23,077 --> 00:03:26,873
[Michael] Yeah, I think that's a bad idea.
And I'm a little concerned about Dusty.

His inexperience could hurt you.
And, I'm sorry,

Yeah, I saw <i>A Few Good Men, </i>too.

She even asked Dusty
to find some secret videotapes.

79
00:03:45,767 --> 00:03:48,186

00:07:31,784 --> 00:07:33,828
If you help me with this illusion,

159
00:07:33,911 --> 00:07:37,290
then you can be my assistant
for the rest of my magic career.

160
00:07:37,623 --> 00:07:39,625
-Every show, every city...
-Oh.

161
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:42,044
...pending availability
and parole conditions,

162
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:43,004
-of course.
-Yeah.

163
00:07:43,087 --> 00:07:46,507
-[indistinct radio chatter]
-But what if I'm convicted, Gob?

164
00:07:48,342 --> 00:07:49,552
I don't know. I'll use Adhir.

165
00:07:49,635 --> 00:07:51,596
-Hmm.
-[Gob] But if you <i>are </i>acquitted,

166
00:07:51,679 --> 00:07:55,224
we can start as soon as next week,
'cause I got a big illusion planned.

167
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:58,561
-You know that wall we're building?
-No. I'm kind of out of the loop.

168
00:07:58,936 --> 00:08:00,438
-Who's Adhir?
-Doesn't matter.

169
00:08:00,521 --> 00:08:03,691
{\an8}[Ron] <i>But the Gay Mafia</i>
<i>wasn't out of the loop.</i>

170
00:08:03,774 --> 00:08:06,777
{\an8}<i>Which is what had led</i>
<i>to two of Argyle's cronies</i>

171
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:08,863
<i>recently showing up in Gob's office.</i>

172
00:08:08,946 --> 00:08:10,865
[man] Argyle heard about the wall project.

173
00:08:10,948 --> 00:08:12,992
And he's a little insulted
you didn't ask him

174
00:08:13,075 --> 00:08:14,785
for a sit-down first.

175
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:17,830
Because had you done the right thing
and talked to Argyle,

176
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,666
you would have remembered
we're Newport Beach's

177
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:22,627
premier cement provider.

178
00:08:23,044 --> 00:08:26,756
Something you already knew
from the trick you did at the parade.

179
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:30,343
The one you did with your friend.
Tony Wonder. Well... [laughs]

180
00:08:30,426 --> 00:08:33,012
-...he certainly knows about it.
-[chuckles weakly]

181
00:08:33,095 --> 00:08:37,058
It-- It's just a prototype wall.
You know, I thought it was too small

182
00:08:37,141 --> 00:08:38,726
to bother Argyle with.

183
00:08:38,809 --> 00:08:42,271
[man 2] Really? Even though you got
Congresswoman Sally Sitwell

184
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:43,397
to call for it?

185
00:08:43,481 --> 00:08:45,775
Because, I tell you what,
you get a federal contract,

186
00:08:45,858 --> 00:08:47,193
that's a lot of cement.

187
00:08:47,276 --> 00:08:50,655
So why don't you let Argyle decide
whether or not he's bothered.

188
00:08:50,738 --> 00:08:54,742
Because if Argyle isn't happy,
the wall isn't gonna be the only thing

189
00:08:54,825 --> 00:08:56,160
covered in cement.

190
00:08:57,078 --> 00:08:58,496
[Ron] <i>They were two tough guys</i>

191
00:08:58,579 --> 00:09:01,874
<i>right out of </i>Guys and Dolls, 
<i>a play they were in the middle</i>

192
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:06,128
<i>of a very successful four-week run of</i>
<i>at a local community theater.</i>

193
00:09:07,004 --> 00:09:09,423
<i>Reminds me of how Hanks walked around</i>

194
00:09:09,507 --> 00:09:13,261
<i>-like Jim Lovell for a year.</i>
-Argyle will be watching.

195
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:17,348
And if he's happy, he just might be okay
with letting you go back

196
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:19,433
to being straight.

197
00:09:20,101 --> 00:09:23,020
[Ron] <i>And while their affect</i>
<i>may have been over the top,</i>

198
00:09:23,104 --> 00:09:25,356
<i>their threats were very real.</i>

199
00:09:26,148 --> 00:09:28,192
-Nice guys.
-[Ron] <i>Of course, it would take Gob</i>

200
00:09:28,276 --> 00:09:30,027
<i>another hour to realize that.</i>

201
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:32,363
So here's the illusion:
I'm gonna go into the wall

202
00:09:32,446 --> 00:09:33,990
-a gay man, which I am.
-[Buster] Wow.

203
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:36,117
If anyone from the Gay Mafia asks.

204
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,536
And then, when I come out the other side,

205
00:09:38,619 --> 00:09:40,496
I will be magically straightened out.

206
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,081
Well, cis male, high butch.

207
00:09:42,164 --> 00:09:46,168
[Ron] <i>Gob had learned a lot</i>
<i>in the short time he'd been magically gay.</i>

208
00:09:46,377 --> 00:09:49,505
Buster, you do this for me...

209
00:09:50,381 --> 00:09:51,257
one day...

210
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:54,927
I'll come to you for a favor.

211
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:58,222
[groaning]

212
00:09:59,682 --> 00:10:01,183
[continues groaning]

213
00:10:02,226 --> 00:10:03,811
[Ron] <i>And so, the next day,</i>

214
00:10:03,894 --> 00:10:07,064
<i>Michael sought out</i>
<i>a highly respected journalist...</i>

215
00:10:07,148 --> 00:10:09,984
Lean Cuisine? I think I got a Lean Pocket
around here somewhere.

216
00:10:10,067 --> 00:10:12,278
[Ron] <i>...who was going</i>
<i>through a bitter divorce.</i>

217
00:10:12,361 --> 00:10:13,404
...nothing, thank you.

218
00:10:14,363 --> 00:10:18,034
You know, you look familiar to me.
Have-- Have we met before?

219
00:10:18,117 --> 00:10:21,454
Well, John, you used our house
for <i>To Entrap a Local Predator.</i>

220
00:10:21,537 --> 00:10:22,622
-That's it.
-Yeah.

221
00:10:22,705 --> 00:10:25,166
-[John] You were one of our super creeps.
-Yeah, yeah. Uh, no.

222
00:10:25,249 --> 00:10:28,711
-Oh, man, you were so out of it.
-[Michael] Yeah.

223
00:10:29,045 --> 00:10:31,714
-[John] I have it here.
-[Ron] <i>And that's when Michael saw footage</i>

224
00:10:31,797 --> 00:10:32,715
<i>from a night</i>

225
00:10:32,798 --> 00:10:34,925
<i>-of which he had no recollection.</i>
-[Michael] That's me!

226
00:10:35,009 --> 00:10:37,386
What am I doing in a Banana Stand shirt?

227
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:38,763
Can you go back before all this?

228
00:10:38,846 --> 00:10:42,433
[Ron] <i>A night in which Michael arrived</i>
<i>somewhat battered and bruised</i>

229
00:10:42,516 --> 00:10:44,518
<i>to the model home,</i>
<i>and ran into a brother...</i>

230
00:10:44,602 --> 00:10:46,395
I'm just not into Cuatro this year.

231
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:48,731
[Ron] <i>...with whom he shared</i>
<i>some very cryptic information.</i>

232
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:51,275
I did something
that I wish I could forget.

233
00:10:51,359 --> 00:10:52,526
You've got no idea how I feel.

234
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:54,945
[Ron] <i>Before being surprised</i>
<i>by a guest of his brother's.</i>

235
00:10:55,446 --> 00:10:56,447
What is he doing there?

236
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:58,282
[Ron] <i>And Michael watched Gob give him</i>
<i>a pill</i>

237
00:10:58,366 --> 00:11:01,494

-What-- What was that?
-[Gob and Michael grunting on tape]

239
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:07,750
-[Michael coughing on tape]
-Whatever it was, it knocked you out

240

-for two days.
-[Gob] <i>...forgetful...</i>

241

-You and I are friends, don't you think?

243
00:11:16,467 --> 00:11:18,678
Objection. Is this going somewhere?

244
00:11:18,761 --> 00:11:21,263
Yeah, that's what I wanted to find out.

245
00:11:23,099 --> 00:11:25,768
So do you think we'll hang out together
after this?

246
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:28,187
-I'll allow it.
-Ah...

247
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:30,106
Hang out, like go to the beach
or something?

248
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:31,607
[Stanley] How does that pertain?

249
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:36,278
I just want to know
if he'll let me see his fort, because...

250
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:38,280
-I'll allow it.
-Oh. [chuckles]

251
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:42,284
-I won't allow that.
-That's... Sustained. That's...

252
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:44,328
That's fine. That's fair. That's... Yeah.

253
00:11:44,412 --> 00:11:47,540
Mr. Bluth, you are a magician by trade.
Is that correct?

254
00:11:47,623 --> 00:11:48,582
-Illusionist.
-[Dusty] Oh.

255
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:50,000
-I'm sorry.
-[Gob] Oh, please.

256
00:11:50,084 --> 00:11:51,585
Sustained. I'll allow it.

257
00:11:52,002 --> 00:11:54,255
And you've worked
with the defendant before.

258
00:11:54,338 --> 00:11:56,757
This assistant--
This was your assistant, is that correct?

259
00:11:57,466 --> 00:12:00,386
Yes, he was my assistant.

260
00:12:00,511 --> 00:12:03,556
[Ron] <i>Gob realized that Buster</i>
<i>had gotten him under oath,</i>

261
00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:05,141
<i>not just as a character witness...</i>

262
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:08,185
Didn't you say he is the best assistant
you ever had?

263
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:11,605
[Ron] <i>...but to compel him</i>
<i>to take moral responsibility</i>

264
00:12:11,689 --> 00:12:13,607
<i>for the dumping of the body.</i>

265
00:12:13,691 --> 00:12:16,235
-Yes, I did.
-[Dusty] And what exactly

266
00:12:16,318 --> 00:12:18,654
was it that made him the best?

267
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:21,073
[Ron] <i>So Gob put</i>
<i>the moral responsibility...</i>

268
00:12:21,157 --> 00:12:22,742
He would never reveal a secret.

269
00:12:22,825 --> 00:12:24,160
[Ron] <i>...back on Buster.</i>

270
00:12:25,035 --> 00:12:26,996
He would just act all dumb, like,

271
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:29,081
-"I don't know what's happening, either."
-Mm.

272
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:33,961
You know, he just-- he was just so good
at acting like, "Where'd she go?

273
00:12:34,044 --> 00:12:36,380
What happened to her?
She just... She vanished."

274
00:12:37,673 --> 00:12:41,427
And he could take any object,
no matter its size, and make it disappear.

275
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:44,096
Gone forever, like it never existed.

276
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:47,850
-You'd never find a trace of it.
-Ladies and gentlemen of the jury...

277
00:12:47,933 --> 00:12:50,728
And he had nerves of steel,
I tell you that much.

278
00:12:51,187 --> 00:12:56,275
Even if he was cutting a woman
in half... with that steel.

279
00:12:56,358 --> 00:12:59,653
And then he'd make the steel disappear
as well.

280
00:12:59,737 --> 00:13:02,072
-So cool.
-He was just a very...

281
00:13:03,699 --> 00:13:05,993
dumb-acting but...

282
00:13:07,578 --> 00:13:09,079
secretly sneaky guy.

283
00:13:09,872 --> 00:13:12,666
[Ron] <i>And a rift had opened up</i>
<i>between the brothers.</i>

284
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:16,629
<i>But Michael had discovered</i>
<i>that Gob was pretty sneaky himself.</i>

285
00:13:16,712 --> 00:13:20,966
So... Gob forget-me-nowed me
because of Tony.

286
00:13:21,592 --> 00:13:24,845
And that would be news on any other day,
but I've gotta save my brother.

Can you play this tape for me?

288
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:30,518
Yeah, sure.
Did anyone tell you about the...?

00:13:30,601 --> 00:13:32,895
Yes. Yep. Twenty-dollar tape deck rental.

290
00:13:33,729 --> 00:13:34,939

00:14:34,748 --> 00:14:37,126
[young Buster] <i>I did it,</i>
<i>but nothing's gonna happen to me</i>

316
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:39,587
<i>-'cause I'm just a boy. </i>
-[Lucille] <i>Can you say it again?</i>

317
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:42,673
[young Buster, distorted] <i>...but nothing's</i>
<i>gonna happen to me 'cause I'm a boy.</i>

318
00:14:42,756 --> 00:14:44,341
[Tobias]
<i>I wish I hadn't finished that juice.</i>

319
00:14:44,425 --> 00:14:46,844
-That's where it ends.
-Can you transfer that onto something

320
00:14:46,927 --> 00:14:48,554
less obsolete? I got to save my brother.

321
00:14:48,929 --> 00:14:52,182
I think it's time to find out
if Mother can handle the truth.

322
00:14:52,641 --> 00:14:54,268
<i>A Few Good Men. </i>Great movie.

323
00:14:54,977 --> 00:14:57,438
-But first, I got to wash the pile...
-Sure. Take your time.

324
00:14:57,521 --> 00:14:58,689
[woman on phone]
<i>Orange County Courthouse.</i>

325
00:14:59,023 --> 00:15:01,567
-Is the Bluth case still in session?
-[Ron] <i>It was.</i>

326
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:05,112
<i>As, after Gob had outsmarted</i>
<i>a dumb lawyer,</i>

327
00:15:05,195 --> 00:15:08,908
<i>the question was,</i>
<i>could he out-dumb a smart lawyer?</i>

328
00:15:08,991 --> 00:15:11,410
These objects that Buster could hide...

329
00:15:12,703 --> 00:15:14,455
were they as big as a human body?

330
00:15:14,663 --> 00:15:16,081
Oh, God, yeah, yeah.

331
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:17,541
Just, I mean, the...

332
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:20,419
often, the exact same dimension
of a human body,

333
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:24,340
of an average human male or female body.

334
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:25,466
Often a female body.

335
00:15:26,383 --> 00:15:28,552
-Any female body, really.
-[Lottie] This list

336
00:15:28,636 --> 00:15:33,724
of skills you mentioned, were they helpful
for, say, covering up a crime?

337
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:38,729
[sighs] I see what you're doing.
[chuckles softly]

338
00:15:39,688 --> 00:15:40,731
Yes, it would.

339
00:15:42,316 --> 00:15:45,319
[Lottie] No more questions. [chuckles]

340
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:47,905
Interesting, huh?
Hers were a lot easier than his.

341
00:15:47,988 --> 00:15:49,823
-[indistinct chatter]
-[door opens]

342
00:15:50,157 --> 00:15:52,409
Permission to interrupt the case.

343
00:15:54,036 --> 00:15:55,996
-Could you identify yourself?
-[Gob] You missed it.

344
00:15:56,413 --> 00:15:59,124
-I killed up there.
-I am Michael Bluth.

345
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:03,671
I am the brother of the defendant
and-- and cocounsel to Dusty.

346
00:16:03,754 --> 00:16:05,422
Permission to join the defense?

347
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:07,299
Oh, that'll be great timing,

348
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:09,009
because I've been drinking
this free court water.

349
00:16:09,426 --> 00:16:11,178
Does the prosecution have any objections?

350
00:16:11,261 --> 00:16:13,514
-[Dusty] I need a break.
-Oh, let him go.

351
00:16:13,597 --> 00:16:16,058
-Oh, he worked through recess.
-[indistinct chatter]

352
00:16:16,141 --> 00:16:18,686
All right.
Mr. Bluth, call your next witness.

353
00:16:18,769 --> 00:16:22,523
I would like to call Lucille Bluth,
the accused mother.

354
00:16:23,774 --> 00:16:26,986
I think you mean "the <i>accused's </i>mother."

355
00:16:28,112 --> 00:16:29,279
Oh, what did I say?

356
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:33,993
Mrs. Bluth, would you please state
your relationship

357
00:16:34,284 --> 00:16:35,869
-to the defendant?
-[Lucille] Look at you,

358
00:16:35,953 --> 00:16:37,621
milking this for every moment.

359
00:16:37,705 --> 00:16:39,415
Isn't this classic Michael?

360
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:43,293
We make fun of him all the time.
Right, Gob?

361
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:46,046
[Ron] <i>The rift</i>
<i>between the brothers had been repaired.</i>

362
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:49,341
-Please just answer the question.
-I'm his mother.

363
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:53,262
The district attorney has provided
some very provocative information

364
00:16:53,345 --> 00:16:55,055
about the defendant. She has claimed

365
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:57,808
that he was responsible,
at a very young age,

366
00:16:57,891 --> 00:16:59,810
for pushing our grandmother, Mimi,

367
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:03,605
down the stairs.
Thus, that he killed before.

368
00:17:04,064 --> 00:17:05,190
What are you doing, Michael?

369
00:17:05,274 --> 00:17:07,067
Trying to prove
the prosecution's theories?

370
00:17:07,151 --> 00:17:09,403
Stop showing off and get to the point.

371
00:17:09,486 --> 00:17:11,655
What if Buster did <i>not </i>push Mimi
down the stairs?

372
00:17:12,489 --> 00:17:14,700
-What are you talking about?
-[Michael] The question is,

373
00:17:14,783 --> 00:17:18,996
do you recall the night
in 1982 when Mimi died?

374
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:20,748
Where are you going with this, Michael?

375
00:17:20,831 --> 00:17:22,708
-I just want the truth.
-Oh, God,

376
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:25,252
are you going for one
of your <i>Few Good Men </i>moments?

377
00:17:25,335 --> 00:17:26,920
You remember the night your mother died.

378
00:17:27,004 --> 00:17:31,216
-Of course I do. Terrible, what happened.
-[Michael] Tell me, what did happen?

379
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:33,677
Because the prosecution
would have us believe

380
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:37,598
that Buster Bluth, your son,
my brother, was responsible

381
00:17:37,681 --> 00:17:39,767
-for that death.
-Well, he did confess to it.

382
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:41,935
So it seems
that even Buster believes the story

383
00:17:42,019 --> 00:17:43,228
that happened in 1982.

384
00:17:43,312 --> 00:17:47,983
It was an accident. He was very young.
He didn't understand the consequences.

385
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:50,277
So you are stating, as a fact,

386
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:52,696
that Buster pushed your mother
down the stairs?

387
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:54,865
<i>Buster </i>says Buster pushed my mother.

388
00:17:54,948 --> 00:17:56,825
And I think <i>you </i>pushed your mother.

389
00:17:57,284 --> 00:17:58,911
I think that Mimi might not have been

390
00:17:58,994 --> 00:18:00,704
the only person that took a fall
that night.

391
00:18:00,788 --> 00:18:03,373
I think you let Buster take a fall
for you.

392
00:18:03,457 --> 00:18:05,000
[Lucille] Oh, I see.

393
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:08,003
So if I pushed my mother
down the stairs, maybe I did this, too?

394
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:10,798
-[Michael] Maybe you did.
-I-- I thought this was about my mother.

395
00:18:10,881 --> 00:18:13,634
-It's about family, all of it.
-Stay on topic, Michael.

396
00:18:13,717 --> 00:18:15,052
[Michael] Okay, let's do that.

397
00:18:15,135 --> 00:18:17,346
Where were you the night
that Lucille Austero disappeared?

398
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:19,807
I don't know where I was.
I don't know who was where!

399
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:21,517
Where were you?

400
00:18:24,645 --> 00:18:26,730
So it seems that I came home
from somewhere.

401
00:18:26,814 --> 00:18:28,899
The point is
that we're talking about you, not me.

402
00:18:28,982 --> 00:18:30,818
[Lucille]
Well, maybe we should talk about you.

403
00:18:30,901 --> 00:18:32,694
You were there. You owed her money!

404
00:18:32,861 --> 00:18:34,696
-[Lucille 2] I need that money.
-[Michael] Sure.

405
00:18:34,863 --> 00:18:36,949
[Lucille] You borrowed it,
didn't you, Michael?

406
00:18:37,699 --> 00:18:40,828
Yes, I did, because I care
about the family, which I thought...

407
00:18:40,911 --> 00:18:43,163
Oh, stay on topic.
You bounce like a beach ball.

408
00:18:43,247 --> 00:18:44,832
[Michael] I'm answering the question.

409
00:18:44,915 --> 00:18:47,126
I'm saying, when you care
about a family or a business,

410
00:18:47,209 --> 00:18:48,877
you do things people might not understand.

411
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:50,754
-[Lucille] Michael!
-...what I might do.

412
00:18:50,838 --> 00:18:52,756
Are you threatening... [screams]

413
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:57,553
And... sometimes you do bad things
that you don't remember...

414
00:18:57,636 --> 00:18:59,513
-or I don't want to remember.
-[man] Objection.

415
00:18:59,596 --> 00:19:01,557
-[Lucille] Michael's out of control.
-[Michael] <i>So maybe I was</i>

416
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,058
out of control that night, but at least

417
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:04,434
-I can admit it.
-[Lucille] Admit what?

418
00:19:04,518 --> 00:19:06,812
You're talking
like <i>you </i>killed Lucille Austero!

419
00:19:06,895 --> 00:19:10,983
-You're goddamn right I did!
-[gallery gasps, murmuring]

420
00:19:11,441 --> 00:19:15,320
[Ron] <i>And that's how Michael</i>
A Few Good Men-ed <i>himself.</i>

421
00:19:15,404 --> 00:19:16,405
I think.

422
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:18,782
I, uh...

423
00:19:19,366 --> 00:19:22,828
I-- I, uh... I was there.
I was there, and, uh...

424
00:19:22,911 --> 00:19:24,580
Hey, Michael,
I need that money I lent you.

425
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:27,082
I think that I went there
to see Lucille 2. I was mad at her.

426
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:28,667
I-- I had borrowed money...

427
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:30,627
Does bad news count?

428
00:19:30,711 --> 00:19:32,379
-[Michael] <i>I'm ashamed. </i>
-What are you doing?

429
00:19:32,462 --> 00:19:34,214
I offered to sleep with her

430
00:19:34,298 --> 00:19:37,259
so that she would forget
my $700,000 debt.

431
00:19:37,718 --> 00:19:39,052
Nice humblebrag.

432
00:19:39,136 --> 00:19:41,013
-Then we fought...
<i>-I cannot be held responsible...</i>

433
00:19:41,096 --> 00:19:42,931
...and I must have done something to her

434
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:45,017
<i>-and gotten my shirt bloody.</i>
-[Lucille 2 screams]

435
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:47,227
Why else would I change it
in the Banana Stand...

436
00:19:47,311 --> 00:19:48,812
Stop.
You don't know what you're talking about.

437
00:19:48,896 --> 00:19:52,691
But I definitely drove the stair car home,
and that's why it was next to the house.

438
00:19:52,774 --> 00:19:56,153
And, uh, the pill. Gob gave me that pill.

439
00:19:56,236 --> 00:19:58,822
That's what I saw
on that video at-- at John Beard's,

440
00:19:58,906 --> 00:20:00,866
which is why I had forgotten
that I was at Cinco.

441
00:20:00,949 --> 00:20:02,242
Okay, Michael, that's enough.

442
00:20:02,326 --> 00:20:05,871
[Michael] Even I was starting to believe
that Buster... but, uh...

443
00:20:06,997 --> 00:20:10,167
-I think that I'm the killer.
<i>-</i>[Ron] <i>And perhaps, it was at that moment</i>

444
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:12,127
<i>-that Lottie realized... </i>
-I object.

445
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:13,962
[Ron] <i>...she had no chance of winning.</i>

446
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:16,840
The opposing counsel... is confessing.

447
00:20:16,924 --> 00:20:18,091
[indistinct chatter]

448
00:20:19,927 --> 00:20:21,887
No further confessions, Your Honor.

449
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:24,514
[Ron] <i>It was a stunningly dramatic twist,</i>

450
00:20:24,598 --> 00:20:27,601
<i>a real </i>Making of a Monster-<i>type moment.</i>

451
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:31,980
-Michael, honest to God...
-Yeah?

452
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:34,983
What the hell was that?
You had me on the stand.

453
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:38,862
-You were making me look like a murderer!
-[Michael] I'm sorry. I found the tapes

454
00:20:38,946 --> 00:20:41,406
where you were making Buster think
he pushed Mimi down the stairs.

455
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:44,034
[Lucille] Exactly. Those are the tapes
I wanted you to find.

456
00:20:44,326 --> 00:20:46,662
I couldn't have laid it out
any more clearly for you.

457
00:20:47,412 --> 00:20:50,666
All you had to do was get me on the stand
and make me look like a liar.

458
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:52,209
How do you screw that up?

459
00:20:52,501 --> 00:20:53,919
Screw that up?

460
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:57,756
What, you wanted me to accuse you
of pushing Mimi down the stairs?

461
00:20:57,839 --> 00:20:59,800
We couldn't have the jury
thinking Buster did it,

462
00:20:59,883 --> 00:21:01,802
because they'd be totally convinced

463
00:21:01,885 --> 00:21:04,596
he did the same thing to Lucille 2,

464
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:07,432
and I couldn't exactly accuse myself
of killing Mimi.

465
00:21:07,641 --> 00:21:11,186
I would just look like a loving mother
lying to protect her son.

466
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:14,606
But I didn't push Mimi
down the stairs. Buster did.

467
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:16,525
Mom, you're on tape
admitting that you did it

468
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:19,403
and telling Buster to confess
to being a murderer.

469
00:21:19,861 --> 00:21:22,406
He thought he was saying that
to save his mother.

470
00:21:22,906 --> 00:21:25,158
We were implanting a memory.

471
00:21:25,242 --> 00:21:27,661
We didn't want him growing up
thinking he was a killer.

472
00:21:28,328 --> 00:21:29,538
Instead, he thinks he's a hero.

473
00:21:29,621 --> 00:21:32,165
Meanwhile, I grow up thinking I'm a hero,

474
00:21:32,249 --> 00:21:34,042
and I turn out to be a killer.

475
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:35,752
-You didn't kill anyone.
-[Michael] No, no.

476
00:21:35,836 --> 00:21:39,214
I think I did. They're probably
on their way to come lock me up right now.

477
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:40,924
Lottie's not going to reopen the case.

478
00:21:41,008 --> 00:21:42,926
Mom, I just confessed in there.

479
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:45,262
That you were drugged
and don't fully remember.

480
00:21:45,345 --> 00:21:46,596
[Michael] Why did I change shirts?

481
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:49,933
-Why did I say I lost control?
-Michael,

482
00:21:50,017 --> 00:21:53,186
they've got nothing.
No body. It's a mistrial.

483
00:21:54,187 --> 00:21:56,148
It's over. Dusty told me.

484
00:21:56,231 --> 00:21:59,026
Two brothers can't be charged
for the same crime.

485
00:21:59,192 --> 00:22:01,778
[Michael] Well, I hate to say it,
but you may have been getting

486
00:22:01,862 --> 00:22:03,238
better advice from Barry.

487
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:06,825
But I should talk. I mean, I thought...
I was better than this family,

488
00:22:06,908 --> 00:22:08,452
but I've made a mess of everything.

489
00:22:08,535 --> 00:22:10,203
I-- I couldn't keep Lindsay around.

490
00:22:10,287 --> 00:22:13,498
My son will likely be ruined
at the wall unveiling

491
00:22:13,582 --> 00:22:17,586
for not having the software.
That's my fault. [sighs]

492
00:22:17,669 --> 00:22:20,297
Turns out, I'm the worst.
I'm the worst Bluth.

493
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:21,798
Never say that!

494
00:22:23,258 --> 00:22:24,926
Gob is the worst.

495
00:22:25,677 --> 00:22:29,181
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

Sally Sitwell can't shut this down

502
00:22:52,913 --> 00:22:54,873
I'm actually more worried
about the Chinese.

503
00:22:54,956 --> 00:22:56,917
I don't think they're happy
with the protesters.

504

If this doesn't work,
they'll never stop coming after us

Oh, God, I just got an amiable nod.

506
00:23:02,422 --> 00:23:05,050
-Are you sure it was amiable?
-Yeah, it was pretty amiable.

507
00:23:05,675 --> 00:23:08,470
Okay, look away.
I wouldn't want our congresswoman

-Colluding with who?

00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:14,643
Oh, the protesters.

511
00:23:14,726 --> 00:23:16,895
I don't know who let these libtards
in here.

512
00:23:16,978 --> 00:23:20,065
-I beg your pardon?
-People with liberal-tardation.

513
00:23:20,148 --> 00:23:22,901
Well, they're not making it easier for me
to sign off on this prototype.

514

-I can't believe you'd let them in.
-We didn't let them in.

515

I-- I don't know how they got
past the guard gate.

516
00:23:28,115 --> 00:23:30,700
You know, maybe we should think
about hiring a guard.

517
00:23:30,784 --> 00:23:33,078
God, I see the problem.

519
00:23:35,997 --> 00:23:37,999

-[Lucille] Tobias!
-Go limp! Go limp!

522
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:43,422
Go... No, no, no, no. You...

523
00:23:43,505 --> 00:23:46,216

[George Sr.] Hmm?

526
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:52,556
[Lucille] You should welcome
some of your friends over there.

527
00:23:52,639 --> 00:23:55,809

I can't believe my dry cleaners came.

[scoffs, clears throat]
What are you doing?

529
00:23:58,854 --> 00:24:01,982
-Are you not a member of this family?
-Uh, he wants to be,

530
00:24:02,065 --> 00:24:04,401
but this is going to guarantee
it'll never happen.

531
00:24:04,484 --> 00:24:07,362
I'm sorry, but I'm doing this
for ethical reasons.

532
00:24:07,446 --> 00:24:09,281
-I need the money.
-[Sally] Money?

533
00:24:09,948 --> 00:24:12,742
-These are paid protesters?
-Who's paying you?

534
00:24:12,826 --> 00:24:13,660
[Maeby] I am.

535
00:24:14,411 --> 00:24:18,039
And, Dad, I made you a chant follower,
not a chant leader.

536
00:24:18,123 --> 00:24:20,041
-Chant follower?
-I'm not paying you for that.

537
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:22,210
Anyway, yes, we're protesting.

538
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:25,338
This family can make George Michael
into a fully-blown Bluth,

539
00:24:25,422 --> 00:24:27,090
but they're not gonna do the same to me.

540
00:24:27,174 --> 00:24:29,092
No, it's turning you into your mother.

541
00:24:29,176 --> 00:24:31,720
Well, maybe this will bring her
back to this family.

542
00:24:31,803 --> 00:24:35,599
Lucille, I am sorry, I cannot authorize
this wall in front of these protesters,

543
00:24:35,682 --> 00:24:38,351

that's doing the protesting.

-Three dollars an hour

546
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:47,736
and a copy of the news footage
for my reel.

547
00:24:47,819 --> 00:24:49,154
How'd you like to be a Bluth?

548
00:24:49,905 --> 00:24:52,365
-Fully-blown?
-No.

549
00:24:52,866 --> 00:24:55,994
And not your creepy girlfriend
or your imbecilic son.

550
00:24:56,077 --> 00:24:59,122
[chuckles] Funny story, that.

551
00:24:59,206 --> 00:25:00,707
They left me.

-Oh.
-[Tobias inhales]

553
00:25:07,255 --> 00:25:10,967

That's why you don't put your girlfriend

554
00:25:11,051 --> 00:25:13,053
in the same sleeping bag with your son.

555
00:25:13,136 --> 00:25:16,848
But I'm not gonna let him share mine.
I like to spread my legs.

556
00:25:16,932 --> 00:25:19,476
-Apparently, so does DeBrie.
-[Tobias] Okay, don't worry about it.

557
00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:23,480
These people will follow me anywhere.
Hmm? Okay, folks, change of plans!

558
00:25:23,563 --> 00:25:27,275
Now, you guys got through, but let's keep
the rest of your family members away.

559
00:25:27,526 --> 00:25:31,696
I say we <i>do </i>put up the wall, huh?
Yes? What's happening?

560
00:25:32,197 --> 00:25:34,491
What? What? Oh, no! Go limp! Go limp!

563
00:25:40,413 --> 00:25:42,165
[George Sr.] Good. I think you're gonna be

564
00:25:42,249 --> 00:25:46,378
very, very impressed by the wall.
It's gonna, you know, keep everything out.

565
00:25:46,461 --> 00:25:48,004
We are much more concerned

566
00:25:48,088 --> 00:25:50,048
with the software portion
of the demonstration.

567
00:25:50,465 --> 00:25:53,927
We are very eager to see
how it interfere with the broadcast.

568
00:25:54,010 --> 00:25:55,762
We need something like this
in China.

569

'Cause your game shows
are the worst. [laughs]

570
00:25:58,181 --> 00:26:01,643
And, of course, this will be very helpful
in avoiding the spread of democracy.

Wh-- What did he mean?
He's not using you in his show, is he?

582
00:26:32,465 --> 00:26:34,718
Yes, because I'm a good assistant,

583
00:26:34,801 --> 00:26:37,220
and unlike you,
I know how to keep a secret.

584
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:41,141
I can't believe you told Warden Gentles
about our family secrets.

[sighs] Look,

586
00:26:43,184 --> 00:26:45,061
you wanted to get out for the parade,

587
00:26:45,145 --> 00:26:47,606
-but I drank too much, okay?
-[Buster whines]

588
00:26:47,939 --> 00:26:51,860
This is why you don't go to rehab.
I lost all my tolerance.

589
00:26:52,485 --> 00:26:53,862
But I tried to fix it.

590
00:26:53,945 --> 00:26:57,616
That's why I wanted Michael
to expose that I was to blame.

591
00:26:57,699 --> 00:27:00,619
How was I to know he'd point the finger
at himself?

592
00:27:01,036 --> 00:27:04,039
-But it worked.
-Mother, I know the truth now.

593
00:27:04,873 --> 00:27:07,000
I always thought <i>you </i>pushed
Mimi down the stairs,

594
00:27:07,083 --> 00:27:09,961
and you made <i>me </i>take the blame.
I got it backwards.

<i>I </i>pushed Mimi down the stairs.

You were just trying to protect me.

10,000 pounds of wet, gay,
QuickHard cement

617

will be poured, because if we build it,
they won't come!

00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:16,403
Oh, that's clever. All right,
get ready to storm the wall.

to you the software that will...

uh-huh, to gay.

-Did somebody say... Wonder?
-[crowd cheers]

793
00:36:29,896 --> 00:36:32,940
I wonder if Gob is... still alive!

794
00:36:34,525 --> 00:36:37,945
[Ron] <i>He was, and as straight</i>
<i>as he'd ever been.</i>

795
00:36:38,112 --> 00:36:41,741
[Buster] And I missed my cue.
And I missed my cue.

796
00:36:41,824 --> 00:36:44,243
[Ron] <i>And Gob and Tony</i>
<i>finally reconnected.</i>

797
00:36:44,327 --> 00:36:46,704
-Sorry about jumping my line.
-[Gob] I don't think anyone noticed.

798
00:36:46,787 --> 00:36:49,248
They were probably
just so surprised to see me still alive.

799
00:36:49,332 --> 00:36:50,958
Like you were blown away
to see me alive?

800
00:36:51,042 --> 00:36:54,045
You disappeared during that closet bit.
I thought that you were ghosting me.

801
00:36:54,128 --> 00:36:56,047
-To make me feel like a fool.
-[Tony] No, look.

802
00:36:56,130 --> 00:36:57,965
I had to switch out
with a mannequin in the closet

803
00:36:58,049 --> 00:36:59,717
and pretend I was in the cement.

804
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:01,844
Oh, no. Yeah, no,
I figured that out to do the...

805
00:37:01,928 --> 00:37:04,222
But when the Gay Mafia
dumped that body on me,

806
00:37:04,305 --> 00:37:05,890
you know, I-- I just, uh... I don't know,

807
00:37:05,973 --> 00:37:09,435
-I thought maybe it wasn't a trick.
-[Tony] Oh, so they wanted to scare you.

808
00:37:09,518 --> 00:37:11,771
My God,
they're such a bunch of drama thugs.

809
00:37:12,563 --> 00:37:15,107
Well, I might not have been dead,
but my career was.

810
00:37:15,191 --> 00:37:17,068
I was doing three shows a day
in Branson in the, uh,

811
00:37:17,151 --> 00:37:19,737
-Yakov Smirnoff Theater.
-What's he like?

812
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:21,906
Disappointing. Disa-- Uh, disappointing.

813
00:37:22,448 --> 00:37:24,575
Yeah, he treats you
like an audience member. 

814
00:37:24,867 --> 00:37:26,619
But you freed me from that.
I still don't know

815
00:37:26,702 --> 00:37:28,829
how you got those Mafia guys
to cancel my contract.

816
00:37:28,913 --> 00:37:30,414
Well, I offered them a better contract.

819
00:37:35,378 --> 00:37:37,505
So I guess we're just a couple
of straight guys, huh?

820
00:37:37,588 --> 00:37:41,759
-What a relief, huh?
-Same. Big-time, same.

821
00:37:41,926 --> 00:37:43,636
I guess I can go back to Joni Beard now.

822
00:37:44,136 --> 00:37:45,888
And I might make it official
with Sally Sitwell.

823
00:37:45,972 --> 00:37:47,598
-So...
-[Sally] Tony!

824
00:37:48,057 --> 00:37:50,935
-Tony!
-Hey. Yes, I see you.

825
00:37:51,936 --> 00:37:56,065
Cool out. One second. She's, um...

826
00:37:56,899 --> 00:37:58,776
Since her dad went missing,
she needs somebody

827
00:37:58,859 --> 00:38:00,486
to run Sitwell Construction, so...

828
00:38:01,904 --> 00:38:04,615
-I guess that would make us competitors.
-[Tony sighs]

829
00:38:05,032 --> 00:38:07,660
I guess, uh,
friendship is out of the question, then.

830
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:13,165
But, I mean, we could do other stuff.

831
00:38:13,416 --> 00:38:14,959
Yeah. Like with our hands.

832
00:38:15,376 --> 00:38:16,669
Just hands.

833
00:38:17,712 --> 00:38:18,879
I'd like that.

834
00:38:19,171 --> 00:38:20,172
Me, too.

835
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:22,550

Yeah!

840
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:33,227
Great idea to have me lose that tooth
when I hit the ground. It worked great.

841
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:35,604
[Michael] And we printed that
in less than two hours.

842
00:38:35,688 --> 00:38:38,774
It was really good.
Hey, hey, hey, perfect timing.

843
00:38:38,858 --> 00:38:41,193
Chinese impressed? Or not?
They didn't see the big finish.

00:38:41,277 --> 00:38:42,194
-Maybe they...
-Well, no.

845
00:38:42,278 --> 00:38:43,946
They got a sense of you. Very accurate.

00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:45,823
Yes, well,
we have Buster to thank for that.

847
00:38:45,906 --> 00:38:48,075
I gave him the mask
and asked him to throw down a mannequin

848
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:49,118
to put in the wall.

849
00:38:49,618 --> 00:38:51,078

00:38:55,249 --> 00:38:58,210
I thought you'd chicken out
and crack at the finish.

00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:35,164
Well, I didn't chicken out. I mean,
people even say I stole the show.

867
00:39:35,247 --> 00:39:37,666
You know, I'm thinking about doing,
like, a solo show.

868
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:39,085
Maybe do some close-up magic.

869
00:39:39,168 --> 00:39:40,544
-A little sleight of...
-Foot.

870
00:39:40,795 --> 00:39:42,671
-Oh. Is it that obvious?
-Yeah.

00:39:42,755 --> 00:39:46,050
-Did you get that from my office?
-[Buster] Yeah, I Ali-Baba-ed a hand,

872
00:39:46,133 --> 00:39:49,470
-but at least they sent me a lefty.
-[Lucille] Just talked to Sally.

873
00:39:49,553 --> 00:39:52,598
She's never going to approve the wall.
Called it a debacle.

874
00:39:52,848 --> 00:39:55,142
And the Chinese got stuck
with the software.

875
00:39:55,226 --> 00:39:57,311
-[both] Yep.
-[Gob] Wait. But isn't it really valuable?

876
00:39:57,395 --> 00:39:59,438
Uh, didn't Murphybrown fix it?

877
00:39:59,772 --> 00:40:02,108
-[Ron] <i>Briefly.</i>
-You made Fakeblock.

878
00:40:02,191 --> 00:40:03,818
You wanna see Ben Affleck's peen?

879
00:40:03,901 --> 00:40:06,695
[Ron] <i>Because after installing</i>
<i>his homemade software</i>

880

<i>into George Michael's computer...</i>

881
00:40:08,489 --> 00:40:10,866
[Tobias] Yep. What? Where is it?
It's all scrambled now.

882
00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:13,619
-It's gone.
-[Murphybrown] Yep, and forever.

883
00:40:13,702 --> 00:40:16,831
I fixed it so there's no way
to actually see the movie now.

884
00:40:16,997 --> 00:40:18,416
-So, um, um...
-So, basically,

885
00:40:18,499 --> 00:40:20,084
you came up
with a way to destroy content?

886
00:40:20,626 --> 00:40:22,294
-[Murphybrown] Yep.
-[Tobias] Damn it.

887
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:25,506
All right. Well, we're back to poor.

888
00:40:25,589 --> 00:40:28,300
Looks like you two will be sharing
a sleeping bag tonight.

889

[Gob] <i>It's just sad</i>
<i>because we also don't have the wall.</i>

890
00:40:30,845 --> 00:40:33,180
It would have been so nice to be
super rich again, you know?

891
00:40:33,264 --> 00:40:34,640
Oh, nobody's gonna build a wall.

892
00:40:34,723 --> 00:40:36,684
According
to the succeeding <i>New York Times,</i>

893
00:40:36,767 --> 00:40:39,687
Donald Trump doesn't even have
a-- a chance of winning that election.

894
00:40:39,770 --> 00:40:42,523
Oh, I don't know,
don't count out his likability.

895
00:40:42,606 --> 00:40:45,568
Oh, I suppose someone should let
toe-quotes "Rebel" know

896
00:40:45,651 --> 00:40:48,779
-that the deal is off, right?
-Yeah... gotta-- gotta say thanks to her.

897
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:51,907
[Ron] <i>But, of course,</i>
<i>Rebel wasn't in on the con.</i>

898
00:40:51,991 --> 00:40:53,242
<i>Maeby was.</i>

899
00:40:53,325 --> 00:40:55,327
-Hey, Michael.
-[George Sr.] Uh, how about that?

900
00:40:55,786 --> 00:40:58,330
-I guess they really did save the day.
-Shh. They'll hear you.

901
00:40:58,664 --> 00:41:00,416
Then they'll want something
for being heroes.

902
00:41:00,499 --> 00:41:02,918
Well, too late. I already did hear you.

903
00:41:03,002 --> 00:41:04,587
They're here for their paychecks.

904
00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:06,672
But I'll settle for a bedroom
with half bath.

905
00:41:06,755 --> 00:41:09,758
Nice try, but it wasn't exactly
your idea to protest.

906
00:41:09,842 --> 00:41:10,885
It was your daughter's.

907
00:41:10,968 --> 00:41:12,636
Where is that rebel?

908
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,180
[Ron] <i>She was celebrating with her cousin.</i>

909
00:41:14,263 --> 00:41:17,224
Wow. Someone thinks his cousin
is his mom.

910
00:41:17,308 --> 00:41:21,395
Uh, ex-- excuse me, it wasn't her idea
to have paid protesters.

911
00:41:21,479 --> 00:41:22,855
It was mine.

912
00:41:22,938 --> 00:41:25,149
I was hoping it would bring out
Lucille Austero.

913
00:41:25,232 --> 00:41:29,153
But the trial is done!
[chuckling] I mean, why do we care?

914
00:41:29,236 --> 00:41:31,238
You don't really think
I had anything to do

915
00:41:31,322 --> 00:41:33,073
with her missing, do you?

916
00:41:35,159 --> 00:41:36,035
Do you?

917
00:41:36,118 --> 00:41:37,912
-Oh, no, Buster!
-Personally, I have nothing...

918
00:41:37,995 --> 00:41:39,413
-No.
-Of course not.

919
00:41:39,497 --> 00:41:41,790
-Oh, honestly!
-Remember who's in your corner.

920
00:41:42,374 --> 00:41:45,211
-Why is everybody so scared?
-Oh, hi, Uncle Buster.

921
00:41:45,294 --> 00:41:49,048
We were just speculating
as to where Lucille 2 ended up.

922
00:41:49,131 --> 00:41:51,091
Uh, we assumed she'd be here to protest.

923
00:41:51,175 --> 00:41:54,470
Well, maybe there's a surprise
under one of these burqas.

924
00:41:54,845 --> 00:41:56,680
[Lucille] You have got to be kidding.

925
00:41:57,181 --> 00:41:59,975
Well,
it's about time you showed your face,

926
00:42:00,059 --> 00:42:02,603
after what you've done
to our family, you--

927
00:42:04,271 --> 00:42:05,272
Hi.

928
00:42:05,898 --> 00:42:08,275
[Tobias] Wait, so, at the-- Protester...

929
00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:09,902
That <i>was </i>you kicking me...

930
00:42:09,985 --> 00:42:12,029
-[Tobias and Lindsay] In the balls.
-[laughs]

931
00:42:12,112 --> 00:42:13,989
Yeah, your mother was kicking me
in the balls.

932
00:42:14,073 --> 00:42:16,408
I thought you left
to find your real mother.

933
00:42:16,617 --> 00:42:19,912
She's dead.
Buster pushed her down some stairs.

934
00:42:20,162 --> 00:42:22,831
Oh, my God. Lucille 2 is your mother?

935
00:42:24,750 --> 00:42:26,627
Mimi. Not Lucille 2.

936
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:28,671
Oh, right.
That is who I pushed down the stairs.

937
00:42:28,754 --> 00:42:32,341
-Hey, hey, hey.
-Well, I just-- I just put my... [grunts]

938
00:42:32,424 --> 00:42:34,218
How often do you get to do that
when you're holding one of these?

939
00:42:34,927 --> 00:42:37,429
I showed her the rest
of the Ron Howard series.

940
00:42:38,013 --> 00:42:39,974
I knew this day was too good to be true.

941
00:42:40,057 --> 00:42:42,851
Let me have it.
I'm a liar and a terrible mother

942
00:42:42,935 --> 00:42:44,353
-for keeping it from you.
-[Lindsay] Yeah.

943
00:42:44,853 --> 00:42:46,355
That's kind of true.

944
00:42:46,939 --> 00:42:51,193
Your anger spread to me,
made me a horrible partner to Tobias.

945
00:42:51,986 --> 00:42:54,530
And I will say you weren't
the most loving mommy yourself.

946
00:42:55,990 --> 00:42:58,576
But to be fair,
you barely knew Murphybrown, so...

947
00:42:58,659 --> 00:42:59,952
Oh, what the [bleep]?

948
00:43:00,244 --> 00:43:03,122
Oh, yes. And you were a horrible mother
to Maeby, too.

949
00:43:03,205 --> 00:43:05,374
[Lindsay] Okay, but on the other hand,

950
00:43:05,457 --> 00:43:09,795
you hid this ugly secret from me
so I wouldn't know my mother deserted me.

951
00:43:10,170 --> 00:43:13,632
So, you were a critical, difficult mother,

952
00:43:13,716 --> 00:43:16,510
but I gotta be honest, Lucy,
you're an amazing sister!

953
00:43:16,927 --> 00:43:19,305
[chuckles] Half-sister.

954
00:43:20,014 --> 00:43:22,474
[Tobias] I'm wondering
if this means that you will, uh,

955
00:43:22,558 --> 00:43:25,561
perhaps be willing to... take me back.

956
00:43:26,186 --> 00:43:28,647
-We're a family.
-[chuckles]

957
00:43:28,731 --> 00:43:31,025
[Ron]
<i>Maeby really wanted to roll her eyes,</i>

958
00:43:31,108 --> 00:43:33,444
<i>but not as much as she wanted the hug.</i>

959
00:43:33,527 --> 00:43:36,113
-[George Sr.] Wow. Family of the year.
-The mother[bleep] year!

960
00:43:36,196 --> 00:43:38,115
Huh? Nothing breaks us apart.

961
00:43:38,198 --> 00:43:39,783
What happened to Michael
and George Michael?

962
00:43:39,867 --> 00:43:40,826
It's like they never showed up.

963
00:43:40,909 --> 00:43:43,120
[George Sr.]
Where the hell are they going?

964
00:43:43,203 --> 00:43:45,247
[Lucille] Probably pulling the car around.

965
00:43:45,331 --> 00:43:47,583
Actually,
I think they might be ready to move on.

966
00:43:47,666 --> 00:43:49,668
[chuckles] Right.
Michael always comes back.

967
00:43:49,752 --> 00:43:52,087
Yeah.
He thinks he has to "bring us together."

968
00:43:52,171 --> 00:43:55,591
[chuckles] Oh, Michael is such a zero.

969
00:43:55,674 --> 00:43:59,303
-Oh, he'll be back. [chuckles]
-Michael always comes back.

970
00:43:59,386 --> 00:44:00,346
[Gob] Oh, he'll be back.

971
00:44:00,429 --> 00:44:02,723
Especially
after something goes horribly wrong,

972
00:44:02,806 --> 00:44:05,059
based on something stupid we did.

973
00:44:05,142 --> 00:44:09,355
I mean, this... [chuckles]
He'll be... God, Michael.

974
00:44:09,438 --> 00:44:13,025
No, no. I don't think anything's
gonna go horribly wrong

975
00:44:13,108 --> 00:44:14,276
for a long, long ti--

976
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:16,153
{\an8}[Ron] On the next <i>Arrested Development...</i>

977
00:44:16,236 --> 00:44:18,489
We're taking down the wall.
What do you want us to do about this part?

978
00:44:18,572 --> 00:44:22,034
[Ron] <i>The family deals</i>
<i>with some fallout from the wall.</i>

979
00:44:22,117 --> 00:44:24,203
Oh, no, that's nothing. Just take it down.

980
00:44:24,286 --> 00:44:26,205
No, I don't think we should do that.
It'll give away the trick.

981
00:44:26,288 --> 00:44:28,082
-We don't wanna reveal the trick.
-[Gob] What are you talking--

982
00:44:28,165 --> 00:44:29,625
It doesn't matter.
Everybody knows that's not me.

983
00:44:29,708 --> 00:44:31,752
You put in a mannequin. That's the trick.

984
00:44:31,835 --> 00:44:34,380
[Lucille] Yeah. It's creepy.
It looks like a person.

985
00:44:34,463 --> 00:44:37,257
-Get it out of here.
-Plus, I wanna get my mask back.

986
00:44:37,341 --> 00:44:38,384
[grunts softly]

987
00:44:40,177 --> 00:44:42,554
[all gasp]

988
00:44:56,860 --> 00:44:59,822
Hey, gang,
does Buster's mannequin look like...

989
00:44:59,905 --> 00:45:01,240
Judy Garland.

990
00:45:01,323 --> 00:45:02,825
[Lucille] Is it Lucille 2?

991
00:45:02,908 --> 00:45:04,618
Why is she smiling?

992
00:45:04,702 --> 00:45:06,203
[indistinct radio chatter]

993
00:45:06,745 --> 00:45:08,163
This isn't a mannequin.

994
00:45:10,916 --> 00:45:12,000
This is...

995
00:45:13,127 --> 00:45:14,920
the happiest corpse I've ever seen.

996
00:45:28,934 --> 00:45:31,895
[clicks tongue] Okay, I did it. So...

997
00:45:37,443 --> 00:45:39,737
But doesn't she remind you of Mom?

998
00:45:39,820 --> 00:45:41,822
[brass version of "Cabaret" playing]

999
00:46:25,991 --> 00:46:27,743
[upbeat music playing]
