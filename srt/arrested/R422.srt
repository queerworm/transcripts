short-term investments.

64
00:03:14,068 --> 00:03:16,779
I have a lot of money coming in
from investors for my software thing,

65
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:18,656
and I don't know
what's gonna happen with that,

66
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:21,159
so I thought I'd do what everyone
around here says, "Put it in a Bluth."

67
00:03:21,242 --> 00:03:23,536
-Who else is saying that?
-It's an expression. Neighbors.

00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:24,704
I don't like it.

69
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:26,831
-Can I offer you anything?
-No.

70
00:03:26,915 --> 00:03:29,751
I just got two more boxes of Twister
from the neighbors.

71
00:03:29,834 --> 00:03:32,462
-Return them.
-I have one for every day of the week.

72
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:37,175
I figure that worst-case scenario is
I sell this place and get my money back.

73

It's a great community.
Nobody locks their doors around here.

-You should.
-Plus, I wanted to make it up to you.

76
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:48,436
I felt terrible about what happened
with the dorm and...

77
00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:50,146
-Wow.
-And things between us.

78
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:54,067
And I've screwed up a lot of things
in the past few weeks,

79
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:59,155
and, you know, this is the one thing
that I know I did right.

00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:05,370
Thank you. Thanks, but you didn't need
to do it for me, pal.

You know, to be totally honest,
I didn't just do it for you.

82
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:10,458
-Yeah.
-I also did it for my girlfriend.

83
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:12,252
Kind of wanted to impress her.

84

Wow. You got a girlfriend. Good for you.
That's great. Congratulations.

00:04:26,975 --> 00:04:28,559
Not great.

89
00:04:28,643 --> 00:04:33,523
I haven't been completely honest
with her about who I am.

-A guy who keeps things anonymous.
-I can do anonymous.

92
00:04:38,861 --> 00:04:42,615
I'm all about staying anonymous.
That's Fakeblock's mission statement.

93
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:47,328
I don't think I can keep that lie going,
so... I think it might be over.

Oh, great.

You're doing great.

-I'm sorry.

{\an8}Oh. Love each other.

a specific piece of advice

{\an8}for a certain situation.
I'll give it to you fast.

I've been living a lie.

{\an8}I've been in this relationship
with a woman who doesn't even know...

143
00:07:31,033 --> 00:07:33,953
It's probably over with the girl.
I might have a chance...

144
00:07:34,036 --> 00:07:35,663
[continues indistinctly]

145
00:07:35,746 --> 00:07:37,331
...some software genius.

146
00:07:37,415 --> 00:07:39,625
It's gone way too far
and gotten out of control.

147
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:43,796
So, basically now I can either tell her
that there is no George Maharis

148
00:07:44,213 --> 00:07:48,050
{\an8}and never was,
or we keep things anonymous

149
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:51,345
{\an8}and I continue the lie
that Fakeblock exists.

150
00:07:53,389 --> 00:07:57,185
From my perspective,
something about "there's a girl..."

151
00:07:57,268 --> 00:08:00,313
Did you... Does she like you? You're not
the world's most handsome guy.

152
00:08:00,396 --> 00:08:02,857
{\an8}-Yeah, no, she likes--
-I would say what I did take away was

153
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:07,320
{\an8}that I would rather have sex with someone
because they thought I was someone else

154
00:08:07,403 --> 00:08:10,698
{\an8}than not have sex with someone
because they thought I was me.

155
00:08:11,574 --> 00:08:14,785
So I should probably do the opposite
of that

156
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:19,290
and be true to who I am
and not compromise my integrity

157
00:08:19,373 --> 00:08:23,085
-just for some fleeting sexual experience.
-There it is.

161
00:08:33,095 --> 00:08:35,598
On Cinco, we break the stick
and not the piñata, okay?

162
00:08:35,681 --> 00:08:37,558
Look... Huh?

163
00:08:37,642 --> 00:08:40,645
Well... How long has it been?

164
00:08:40,728 --> 00:08:42,813
-Five years.
-What are you doing here?

165
00:08:42,897 --> 00:08:45,691
I'm taking my five-year-old
to see <i>Fantastic Four.</i>

166
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:48,736
I'm pretty sure that's an adult...
Wait, you have a five-year-old?

167
00:08:48,819 --> 00:08:50,321
And his father's a magician.

168
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:01,040
Oh. It's not us.

169
00:09:01,123 --> 00:09:04,377
Don't worry. It's not you.
It was a real magician.

170
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:08,089
He took advantage of how angry I was
when you wouldn't come out of that cave.

171
00:09:08,172 --> 00:09:09,590
He promised me a life together

172
00:09:09,674 --> 00:09:12,301
and after he had his way with me,
he never wanted to see me again.

173
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:15,972
I don't think there's anything wonderful
about Tony Wonder.

174
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:18,432
-Are you kidding me? Are you saying--
-Yes.

175
00:09:18,516 --> 00:09:19,725
Tony's straight?

176
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:21,561
[narrator] <i>Gob felt betrayed.</i>

177
00:09:22,895 --> 00:09:26,023
How would you like to spend the night
making revenge love?

178
00:09:26,107 --> 00:09:29,860
[narrator] <i>And as they both set off</i>
<i>to sexually settle a score,</i>

179
00:09:29,944 --> 00:09:31,862
<i>Michael was hoping to do the same thing.</i>

180
00:09:33,114 --> 00:09:34,240
What are you doing?

181
00:09:34,323 --> 00:09:36,576
I'm gonna have sex with you for money.

182
00:09:37,034 --> 00:09:38,828
{\an8}-Ow!
-[gasps]

183
00:09:38,953 --> 00:09:41,914
{\an8}I didn't realize
how heavy these rings are.

184
00:09:42,039 --> 00:09:45,042
But I thought you were gonna kiss me,
and I panicked. [laughing]

185
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:48,129
I was gonna kiss you.

186
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:52,174
I didn't even try to do it that time.

187
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:56,470
So, it's "Let's take a tumble
with Old Moneybags," right?

188
00:09:56,554 --> 00:10:00,808
And she'll be so grateful
that she'll walk away from $700,000.

189
00:10:00,891 --> 00:10:02,727
No, no, no,
it would absolutely not be a gift.

190
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:04,478
This would still be a loan, okay?

191
00:10:04,562 --> 00:10:07,273
However, my lovemaking
would be, you know...

192
00:10:07,481 --> 00:10:10,109
What? What, Michael?
What were you gonna say?

193
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:14,697
Something that I would never be able
to take back, but...

194
00:10:15,406 --> 00:10:18,993
I didn't want that to happen.
Listen, you want this as much as I do.

195
00:10:19,368 --> 00:10:22,371
As much as I want this extension.
Two different this-es.

196
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:25,750
Now, you own a company
that I helped to build.

197
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:27,418
It was all of my hard work.

198
00:10:27,501 --> 00:10:29,837
This is something you have to do,
because if you don't,

199
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:32,214
I can't be held responsible
for what I might do.

200
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:35,926
[narrator]<i> Michael wasn't the only Bluth</i>

-You can't stop me.

202
00:10:38,054 --> 00:10:40,848
I need to pay her back

You're out!

I'm on a work-release program.

Don't worry about Lucille 2.
I'll handle her.

206

You kept me from mother?
You sent her to prison?

[crowd chanting]
Put... up... this... wall! Put up this...

222
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:37,071
Let's put up this wall.
Have a good night.

223
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:40,616
[narrator] <i>But Rebel wasn't the only one</i>

Yeah, okay. Well, don't get ready yet.
Tony's not going to be here for a bit.

227
00:11:57,216 --> 00:11:58,050
Tony?

228
00:11:58,676 --> 00:12:00,928
You're having sex
with Tony Wonder tonight.

229
00:12:01,011 --> 00:12:03,514
Well, I thought we were having sex.

230
00:12:03,597 --> 00:12:06,767
Oh! No, thank you.
Listen, here's the plan.

231
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:10,563
This house is wired with hidden cameras
from <i>Entrap a Local Predator.</i>

232
00:12:10,646 --> 00:12:13,357
{\an8}<i>There, there, there and there.</i>

233
00:12:14,191 --> 00:12:16,026
We're gonna destroy Tony's career

234
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:18,571
by proving that he's straight
when he has sex with you

235
00:12:18,654 --> 00:12:22,658
while you're wearing... this Gob mask.

236
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:24,452
Oh, and this little black mini robe.

237
00:12:25,035 --> 00:12:27,663
Just to really sell that you're a man.

238
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:29,373
Why would I wear a Gob mask?

239
00:12:29,457 --> 00:12:31,584
Tony's coming here expecting
to have sex with me.

240
00:12:31,667 --> 00:12:36,255
Look, in the act of having fake gay sex,
you're gonna take off the mask

241
00:12:36,338 --> 00:12:38,758
to reveal
that you're having real straight sex,

242
00:12:38,841 --> 00:12:40,134
destroying his career,

243
00:12:40,217 --> 00:12:42,887
{\an8}and it's all gonna be captured
on that camera.

244
00:12:43,471 --> 00:12:45,264
{\an8}<i>I don't want to have sex with Tony.</i>

245
00:12:45,848 --> 00:12:49,185
-Aren't you just a little cur...
-I have a child with him!

246
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:52,062
Okay, yes, new plan.

247
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:57,443
I'm gonna wear this Tony Wonder mask.
You're gonna wear the Gob mask, and...

248
00:12:58,527 --> 00:13:01,614
I am gonna have sex with you.
I'm sorry about all that.

249
00:13:02,114 --> 00:13:04,909
And then, again,
you're gonna rip off the Gob mask,

250
00:13:04,992 --> 00:13:07,661
the world will think he's straight,
and it'll ruin his career.

251
00:13:07,745 --> 00:13:10,039
That's great.
Much simpler plan, thank you.

252
00:13:10,122 --> 00:13:16,170
But the main event is us having this...
pretend-gay-but-actually-straight sex.

253
00:13:16,253 --> 00:13:18,756
And you know what it is?
It's a straight bait.

254
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:21,675
I just realized, it's a straight bait.
You ever watch those?

255
00:13:23,093 --> 00:13:27,598
Good. And let me have the room, yeah.
I need a little while to get same.

256
00:13:28,557 --> 00:13:29,767
To be the same.

257
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:34,480
[narrator] <i> Downstairs, however,</i>
<i>Tony had arrived early...</i>

258
00:13:34,563 --> 00:13:35,731
Hello.

259
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:39,693
[narrator] <i>And was looking for a place</i>

261
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:45,199
Hey... you.

262
00:13:45,783 --> 00:13:48,577
It's Ann.
Awfully funny time to run into you.

263
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:53,999
Yes, it is an awfully funny time
to see you, too... you.

264
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:56,585
I know I owe you child support.

265
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:58,087
Don't worry,
I got something big in the works.

266
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:00,089
That's why I came here.
What are you doing here?

267
00:14:00,172 --> 00:14:03,300
Gob invited me.
He's planning on getting revenge on you.

268
00:14:03,384 --> 00:14:05,511
[laughs] He would never do that.

269
00:14:05,594 --> 00:14:08,430
Then why did he want
to have sex with me with this on?

270
00:14:12,476 --> 00:14:13,352
Tony?

271
00:14:13,435 --> 00:14:15,729
Why would he do that?
I thought he was gay.

272
00:14:15,813 --> 00:14:18,274
-Tony, you're not gay, either.
-That's business.

273
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:20,401
Why do you think David Geffen pretends
to be gay?

274
00:14:20,484 --> 00:14:23,571
You think the Shubert Organization
would entrust a project like <i>Dreamgirls</i>

275
00:14:23,654 --> 00:14:24,697
to a straight producer?

276
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:28,576
If you wanted to be in the film version
of a musical called <i>The Magic Show,</i>

277
00:14:28,659 --> 00:14:32,288
done in 1974 by another secretly
straight guy named Doug Henning,

278
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:34,039
you'd make it your business, too.

279
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:36,500
I mean, they can't give everything
to Doogie Howser, right?

280
00:14:36,584 --> 00:14:38,794
Biggest fake gay there is, by the way.

281
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:41,255
But if I fund it,
then they can't say no to me.

282
00:14:41,338 --> 00:14:43,632
But it's big money.
I mean, 20, 30, 40 mil.

283
00:14:43,924 --> 00:14:47,177
Fakeblock money. I can't believe
I'm telling you all this. I--

284
00:14:47,261 --> 00:14:50,014
I've been over-explaining the [bleeps]
out of everything lately.

285
00:14:50,097 --> 00:14:52,808
-You can't tell a soul.
-No one I know will care.

286
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:55,352
Look, do you want to out Gob as gay

287
00:14:55,436 --> 00:14:57,479
so it'll ruin his career
as the Christian magician?

288
00:14:58,105 --> 00:15:00,524
-Yes.
-You and I will have sex.

289
00:15:00,608 --> 00:15:03,319
And you wear this Gob mask,
and I'll wear a Tony Wonder mask.

290
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:06,280
Okay, I have two questions.
One, are you going to move this time?

291
00:15:06,363 --> 00:15:09,992
And two, why can't I just be me
and you wear the Gob mask?

292
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:13,829
I just thought that
if you had to have sex with a man,

293
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:17,875
wouldn't it be more of a turn-on to have
sex with someone that looks like you?

294
00:15:20,294 --> 00:15:23,631
Okay, put these on and then meet me
in the bedroom in five minutes

295
00:15:23,714 --> 00:15:26,050
for some serious secular intercourse.

296
00:15:26,634 --> 00:15:28,761
-With myself!
-Yeah.

297
00:15:36,101 --> 00:15:37,186
-Same.
-Same.
