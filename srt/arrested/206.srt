narrator: 
NOW THE STORY

2
00:00:02,668 --> 00:00:04,420
OF A WEALTHY FAMILY 
WHO LOST EVERYTHING

3
00:00:04,420 --> 00:00:06,131
AND THE ONE SON 
WHO HAD NO CHOICE

4
00:00:06,131 --> 00:00:08,008
BUT TO KEEP THEM ALL TOGETHER.

5
00:00:13,179 --> 00:00:15,890
IT'S "ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT."

6
00:00:18,351 --> 00:00:20,811
MICHAEL WAS USING 
THE BLUTH COMPANY CRANE

7
00:00:20,811 --> 00:00:23,939
TO RETRIEVE THE FAMILY-OWNED 
FROZEN BANANA STAND

8
00:00:23,939 --> 00:00:26,109
AFTER IT HAD BEEN DUMPED 
IN THE BAY,

9
00:00:26,109 --> 00:00:29,070
A HOLIDAY TRADITION 
AMONG THE LOCAL YOUTH.

10
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:31,864
SOON HE RETURNED HOME SO THAT 
HE AND HIS SON--

11
00:00:31,864 --> 00:00:32,948
- GEORGE MICHAEL?

12
00:00:32,948 --> 00:00:34,825
narrator: COULD SHARE 
THEIR HOLIDAY TRADITION

13
00:00:34,825 --> 00:00:35,535
OF REBUILDING IT.

14
00:00:35,535 --> 00:00:36,786
- ANOTHER ONE OF DAD'S SUITS?

15
00:00:36,786 --> 00:00:37,995
- HEY, I'M THE PRESIDENT NOW.

16
00:00:37,995 --> 00:00:40,123
FILLING DAD'S SHOES 
LITERALLY,

17
00:00:40,123 --> 00:00:42,375
EXCEPT HIS SHOES 
DON'T FIT.

18
00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:44,710
BUT I DID FINALLY GET 
INTO DAD'S PANTS,

19
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:47,922
ALTHOUGH I HAD TO HAVE 
THE CROTCH TAKEN IN A LITTLE.

20
00:00:47,922 --> 00:00:49,590
- YOU KNOW, GOB, MAYBE 
IT'S THE SUITS,

21
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:51,092
BUT I THINK YOU 
MAY BE BEGINNING

22
00:00:51,092 --> 00:00:54,011
TO ALIENATE SOME 
OF THE EMPLOYEES DOWN AT WORK.

23
00:00:54,011 --> 00:00:56,639
- WHAT? OH, THAT'S GREAT.

24
00:00:56,639 --> 00:01:00,017
THE PRESIDENT HAS TO WORRY ABOUT 
ALIENATING THE EMPLOYEES NOW.

25
00:01:00,017 --> 00:01:02,103
narrator: IN FACT, GOB HAD 
STARTED TO ALIENATE

26
00:01:02,103 --> 00:01:03,813
SOME OF HIS COLLEAGUES.

27
00:01:03,813 --> 00:01:05,856
THE WORST THAT COULD HAPPEN 
IS I COULD SPILL SOME

28
00:01:05,856 --> 00:01:08,651
ON MY $3,000 SUIT. COME ON!

29
00:01:08,651 --> 00:01:09,444
- HEY!

30
00:01:09,444 --> 00:01:12,863
- THE GUY IN THE $4,000 SUIT 
IS HOLDING THE ELEVATOR

31
00:01:12,863 --> 00:01:14,949
FOR THE GUY WHO DOESN'T MAKE 
THAT IN THREE MONTHS.

32
00:01:14,949 --> 00:01:16,326
COME ON!

33
00:01:16,326 --> 00:01:19,036
WHY DON'T I JUST TAKE A WHIZ 
THROUGH THIS $5,000 SUIT?

34
00:01:19,036 --> 00:01:21,081
COME ON! 
THEY LIKE ME JUST FINE.

35
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:22,665
YOU'LL SEE THAT TONIGHT

36
00:01:22,665 --> 00:01:24,500
WHEN THEY TOAST ME 
AT THE CHRISTMAS PARTY,

37
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:26,169
JUST LIKE THEY USED TO WITH DAD.

38
00:01:26,169 --> 00:01:28,463
- THEY USED TO ROAST DAD 
'CAUSE THEY THOUGHT THAT

39
00:01:28,463 --> 00:01:29,922
HE HAD A SENSE OF HUMOR 
ABOUT HIMSELF,

40
00:01:29,922 --> 00:01:31,466
BUT HE DIDN'T, 
AND NEITHER DO YOU.

41
00:01:31,466 --> 00:01:34,677
- HEY, NOBODY LAUGHED LOUDER 
THAN ME AT ANY JOKE ABOUT DAD.

42
00:01:34,677 --> 00:01:35,928
YOU WERE THE ONE WHO'S ALL

43
00:01:35,928 --> 00:01:38,514
MR. "I TAKE MYSELF TOO SERIOUSLY 
ALL THE TIME."

44
00:01:38,514 --> 00:01:40,683
narrator: MICHAEL DID TEND 
TO TAKE THE CHRISTMAS PARTY

45
00:01:40,683 --> 00:01:41,684
SOMEWHAT SERIOUSLY.

46
00:01:41,684 --> 00:01:42,810
- MERRY CHRISTMAS.

47
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:45,062
YOU CAN GO AHEAD AND PUT THAT 
RIGHT IN THE CHARITY BARREL.

48
00:01:45,062 --> 00:01:46,397
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. 
THANKS A LOT.

49
00:01:46,397 --> 00:01:48,191
SORRY, PAL. WE JUST CAN'T 
HAVE THEM RESENT US.

50
00:01:48,191 --> 00:01:50,067
- I KNOW SOME OF THE NUMBERS 
HAVEN'T ALL ADDED UP,

51
00:01:50,067 --> 00:01:52,237
AND THERE IS SOME SPECULATION.

52
00:01:52,237 --> 00:01:56,157
THAT GEORGE HAS BEEN 
INTO THE KITTY.

53
00:01:56,157 --> 00:01:56,949
[laughter]

54
00:01:56,949 --> 00:01:58,451
- "INTO THE KITTY!" 
THAT'S AWESOME.

55
00:01:58,451 --> 00:02:01,996
- FIRE TOM AND GET YOUR JACKASS 
BROTHER OUT OF HERE.

56
00:02:01,996 --> 00:02:04,124
- THIS YEAR 
I'M NOT OFFICIALLY PRESIDENT,

57
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:06,000
AND IT'LL BE NICE 
TO ACTUALLY HAVE SOME FUN

58
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,960
WITH MY SON 
AT A CHRISTMAS PARTY.

59
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:09,587
- THANK GOD I DON'T HAVE TO GO.

60
00:02:09,587 --> 00:02:11,172
- SO GLAD TO HEAR YOU SAY THAT.

61
00:02:11,172 --> 00:02:12,298
I WANNA MEET SOMEONE THERE.

62
00:02:12,298 --> 00:02:13,258
- WHAT?

63
00:02:13,258 --> 00:02:15,593
SO I'M NOT INVITED TO THE 
BLUTH COMPANY CHRISTMAS PARTY?

64
00:02:15,593 --> 00:02:19,347
- OH, HONEY, OF COURSE 
YOU CAN GO IF YOU WANT TO.

65
00:02:19,347 --> 00:02:20,306
- THANKS, MOM.

66
00:02:20,306 --> 00:02:22,475
- NO. YOU'RE NOT GOING TO THAT.

67
00:02:22,475 --> 00:02:23,851
YOU SEE, IF I SHOW UP 
WITH YOU,

68
00:02:23,851 --> 00:02:26,103
IT'LL JUST MAKE ME 
SEEM LIKE I'M A MOTHER.

69
00:02:26,103 --> 00:02:27,563
- I'VE NEVER THOUGHT OF YOU 
THAT WAY.

70
00:02:27,563 --> 00:02:28,898
- THAT'S SWEET.

71
00:02:28,898 --> 00:02:30,107
- WELL, I WON'T BE GOING.

72
00:02:30,107 --> 00:02:33,903
I WILL BE HEAD TO TOE 
IN BLUE MAKEUP UNTIL 8:01,

73
00:02:33,903 --> 00:02:36,281
IN CASE THE BLUE MAN GROUP 
NEEDS THEIR UNDERSTUDY, SO--

74
00:02:36,281 --> 00:02:38,866
- NO, NO, YOU HAVE TO GO. 
SO WHEN MEN FIND OUT

75
00:02:38,866 --> 00:02:41,369
WE'RE IN AN OPEN RELATIONSHIP, 
THEY'LL SEE YOU'RE NO THREAT.

76
00:02:41,369 --> 00:02:44,747
PEOPLE HEAR THE NAME TOBIAS, 
THEY THINK BIG, BLACK GUY.

77
00:02:44,747 --> 00:02:47,958
- WELL, OBVIOUSLY 
I'M NOT A BIG GUY.

78
00:02:47,958 --> 00:02:50,920
I'M NOT A CARL WEATHERS, 
PAR EXAMPLE.

79
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,880
- I FORGOT ABOUT CARL. 
IS HE STILL SINGLE?

80
00:02:54,173 --> 00:02:55,341
- HEY, GEORGE MICHAEL,

81
00:02:55,341 --> 00:02:57,051
I NEED YOU TO HELP ME 
FIX UP THE BANANA STAND.

82
00:02:57,051 --> 00:02:58,219
- NO, I CAN'T.

83
00:02:58,219 --> 00:03:00,680
I WAS SUPPOSED TO GO TO ANN'S 
PARENTS' CHRISTMAS PARTY.

84
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:01,764
WE'RE MAKIN' YAMS.

85
00:03:01,764 --> 00:03:04,434
- TONIGHT? TONIGHT 
IS THE OFFICE PARTY.

86
00:03:04,434 --> 00:03:06,060
- WELL, DID YOU WANT ME 
TO GO TO THAT?

87
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:08,354
YOU'RE ALWAYS TELLING ME 
NOT TO HAVE FUN AT THOSE THINGS.

88
00:03:08,354 --> 00:03:11,649
- YES. WE MIGHT EVEN SNATCH A 
GIFT FROM THE CHARITY BARREL.

89
00:03:11,649 --> 00:03:14,109
- OH. OKAY, WELL--WELL, I THINK 
ANN'S PARENTS

90
00:03:14,109 --> 00:03:15,861
ARE HAVING 
THEIR PARTY ON BETHLEHEM TIME,

91
00:03:15,861 --> 00:03:18,531
WHICH IS PRETTY EARLY, SO MAYBE 
I CAN MAKE AN APPEARANCE.

92
00:03:18,531 --> 00:03:21,784
- MAKE AN APPEARANCE? 
UH--UH--NO, NO. IT'S OKAY.

93
00:03:21,784 --> 00:03:23,244
YOU BE WITH YAM. 
IT'S FINE. IT'S GOOD.

94
00:03:23,244 --> 00:03:24,620
- IT'S ANN.

95
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:27,081
- IT'S GOOD. 
HAVE FUN.

96
00:03:27,081 --> 00:03:28,541
- THE BOY'S PULLING AWAY 
FROM YOU.

97
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:30,710
ARE WE HAVING YAMS?

98
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:32,462
- YEAH, I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S 
GOIN' ON WITH HIM.

99
00:03:32,462 --> 00:03:33,796
YOU KNOW, 
HE'S ON BETHLEHEM TIME.

100
00:03:33,796 --> 00:03:35,881
HE'S SPENDING EVERY MOMENT 
OF THE DAY WITH THIS GIRL.

101
00:03:35,881 --> 00:03:38,092
IT'S, LIKE, I'M HIS FATHER. 
HE SHOULD BE SPENDING MOST--

102
00:03:38,092 --> 00:03:39,051
- WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

103
00:03:39,051 --> 00:03:40,303
DON'T GET INVOLVED. BELIEVE ME.

104
00:03:40,303 --> 00:03:43,306
WHEN I THOUGHT YOUR FIRST WIFE 
WAS DRIVING US APART,

105
00:03:43,306 --> 00:03:44,974
I DID NOT MAKE A STINK.

106
00:03:44,974 --> 00:03:46,767
- YOU COMPLAINED ALL THE TIME,

107
00:03:46,767 --> 00:03:50,145
AND SHE WAS MY ONLY WIFE. 
AND SHE DIED.

108
00:03:50,145 --> 00:03:52,607
- WELL, SEE, THINGS HAVE A WAY 
OF WORKING THEMSELVES OUT.

109
00:03:52,607 --> 00:03:53,691
[phone ringing]

110
00:03:53,691 --> 00:03:56,402
- NONETHELESS, IT'S FAMILY FIRST 
AT THE HOLIDAYS.

111
00:03:56,402 --> 00:03:59,196
OH, GOD. IT'S MOM AGAIN. 
- PUT IT ON SPEAKERPHONE.

112
00:03:59,196 --> 00:04:00,531
I WANNA HEAR 
HER BEAUTIFUL VOICE.

113
00:04:00,531 --> 00:04:01,866
- [screams] MICHAEL!

114
00:04:01,866 --> 00:04:04,660
THERE'S A HOLE IN THE WINDOW! 
THERE'S BEEN A BREAK-IN!

115
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:05,536
GET OVER HERE!

116
00:04:05,536 --> 00:04:06,954
- I'M LEAVING NOW.

117
00:04:06,954 --> 00:04:09,039
- SOUNDS TENSE.

118
00:04:09,039 --> 00:04:11,709
THAT MEANS SHE'S NOT GETTIN' ANY 
FROM MY BROTHER, OSCAR.

119
00:04:11,709 --> 00:04:13,168
- LOVELY. THAT'S NICE.

120
00:04:14,587 --> 00:04:18,258
I HEARD ABOUT THE BANANA STAND, 
AND NOW THERE'S BEEN A BREAK-IN.

121
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:21,719
BUT I HAVE A SURPRISE FOR 
WHOEVER IT IS IF HE COMES BACK.

122
00:04:21,719 --> 00:04:24,347
FIRST I BLOW HIM; 
THEN I POKE HIM.

123
00:04:24,347 --> 00:04:27,433
- GUY HAS NO IDEA 
WHAT HE'S IN FOR.

124
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:29,727
YOU KNOW, MOM, ALL THE GLASS 
SEEMS TO BE ON THE OUTSIDE.

125
00:04:29,727 --> 00:04:32,229
PLUS, HERE'S YOUR LITTLE STATUE,

126
00:04:32,229 --> 00:04:33,773
SO I GUESS WHAT THIS SAYS 
TO ME IS,

127
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:36,276
I DOUBT ANYONE WAS 
TRYING TO BREAK IN, MOM.

128
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:38,068
IF ANYTHING, SOMEONE 
WAS TRYING TO BREAK OUT.

129
00:04:38,068 --> 00:04:39,362
WHERE IS OSCAR?

130
00:04:39,362 --> 00:04:42,907
- WELL, HE'S ON HIS WALKABOUT 
OR PILGRIMAGE.

131
00:04:42,907 --> 00:04:46,577
narrator: EVERY YEAR, OSCAR 
ATTEMPTS THE 420-MILE WALK

132
00:04:46,577 --> 00:04:49,455
FROM NEWPORT BEACH 
TO BERKELEY, CALIFORNIA.

133
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:52,292
IN THE 12 YEARS 
HE'S ATTEMPTED THIS,

134
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:56,128
HE'S NEVER 
MADE IT PAST U.C. IRVINE.

135
00:04:56,128 --> 00:04:57,922
- HE CALLS IT A QUEST 
TO RECHARGE HIS CHI.

136
00:04:57,922 --> 00:04:59,799
I CALL IT AN EXCUSE FOR HIM

137
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:02,385
TO SCORE HIS POT 
AND WAG HIS PICKLE AT COEDS.

138
00:05:02,385 --> 00:05:03,844
- YOU SOUND MAD, MOM, MAD ENOUGH

139
00:05:03,844 --> 00:05:05,638
TO THROW ONE OF THESE 
LITTLE LADY HEADS AT HIM.

140
00:05:05,638 --> 00:05:07,097
- WHAT'S THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

141
00:05:07,097 --> 00:05:09,809
- WELL, MAYBE YOU'RE A LITTLE 
BIT LONELY,

142
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:12,395
AND YOU'RE ACTING OUT 
FOR ATTENTION.

143
00:05:12,395 --> 00:05:13,479
- THAT'S RIDICULOUS.

144
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:15,565
I WANT YOU TO MOVE IN 
WITH ME.

145
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:19,569
- WHAT? NO. NO. NO. 
NO, NO, NO, NO.

146
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:21,529
DIDN'T YOU ADOPT A CHILD 
FOR THIS VERY REASON?

147
00:05:21,529 --> 00:05:22,988
SO THAT 
YOU WOULD NEVER BE ALONE?

148
00:05:22,988 --> 00:05:24,740
- MICHAEL, A MOTHER 
DOESN'T HAVE A CHILD

149
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:26,492
TO GIVE HERSELF COMPANY.

150
00:05:26,492 --> 00:05:28,160
ANNYONG WAS 
TO TEACH BUSTER A LESSON.

151
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,245
- AND WHERE 
IS THAT LITTLE LESSON?

152
00:05:30,245 --> 00:05:32,582
- I SENT HIM TO THE MILFORD 
ACADEMY TO TEACH HIM A LESSON.

153
00:05:32,582 --> 00:05:35,209
I CAN'T REMEMBER ABOUT WHAT.

154
00:05:35,209 --> 00:05:38,295
AND BUSTER LEFT THIS MORNING 
TO FINISH HIS ARMY TRAINING.

155
00:05:38,295 --> 00:05:40,923
narrator: IN FACT, 
LUCILLE HAD REFUSED TO DRIVE HIM

156
00:05:40,923 --> 00:05:43,008
TO THE ARMY BASE,

157
00:05:43,008 --> 00:05:46,011
SO BUSTER WAS TAKING 
HIS VERY FIRST BUS RIDE.

158
00:05:46,011 --> 00:05:47,555
- I CAN'T CHANGE A HUNDRED.

159
00:05:47,555 --> 00:05:48,764
- OH.

160
00:05:49,974 --> 00:05:53,894
OH, GOD. OH.

161
00:05:53,894 --> 00:05:59,066
narrator: AND THAT'S WHEN BUSTER 
SAW SOMETHING INTERESTING.

162
00:05:59,066 --> 00:06:01,777
- THAT COULD BE GOOD FOR ARMY. 
[laughs]

163
00:06:01,777 --> 00:06:04,489
[imitates whirring crane]

164
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:06,156
narrator: WHILE JUST 
20 YARDS AWAY,

165
00:06:06,156 --> 00:06:08,743
MICHAEL WENT TO WORK 
REPAIRING THE BANANA STAND.

166
00:06:08,743 --> 00:06:10,745
- WHAT ARE YOU DOIN' HERE?

167
00:06:10,745 --> 00:06:12,162
- MY MOM SIGNED ME 
OUT OF SCHOOL EARLY

168
00:06:12,162 --> 00:06:14,248
SO THEN SHE WOULDN'T HAVE 
TO PICK ME UP LATER,

169
00:06:14,248 --> 00:06:16,417
SO THEN SHE WOULDN'T BE LATE 
FOR THE CHRISTMAS PARTY.

170
00:06:16,417 --> 00:06:18,252
- THAT'S ABOUT THE WORST THING 
I'VE EVER HEARD.

171
00:06:18,252 --> 00:06:19,086
- I HAD TO DRIVE,

172
00:06:19,086 --> 00:06:20,671
BECAUSE SHE HAD 
A LITTLE BIT OF A BUZZ ON.

173
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:22,465
- NO. THAT'S IT.

174
00:06:22,465 --> 00:06:26,260
- YOU DOING THIS ALONE? 
- YEAH. WELL, THANKS.

175
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:28,345
I GUESS GEORGE MICHAEL'S 
GETTIN' A LITTLE TOO OLD

176
00:06:28,345 --> 00:06:29,346
TO HANG OUT WITH HIS DAD.

177
00:06:29,346 --> 00:06:31,432
- YEAH, AND I'M GETTING TOO OLD 
FOR MY MOM TO BE WITH ME.

178
00:06:31,432 --> 00:06:32,433
- YOU KNOW WHAT?

179
00:06:32,433 --> 00:06:34,101
MAYBE WE SHOULD GO 
TO THIS PARTY TOGETHER.

180
00:06:34,101 --> 00:06:35,728
- REALLY? 
- YEAH. YOU'RE MY LITTLE NIECE.

181
00:06:35,728 --> 00:06:37,688
I THINK WE SHOULD BE SPENDING 
A LITTLE BIT MORE TIME TOGETHER.

182
00:06:37,688 --> 00:06:39,398
- YEAH, AND IF IT MAKES MY MOM 
JEALOUS--

183
00:06:39,398 --> 00:06:42,317
- AND GEORGE MICHAEL CAN RUN 
BACK TO HIS PRECIOUS ANN.

184
00:06:42,317 --> 00:06:44,361
GREAT. GOOD DEAL.

185
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:53,245
[bells jingling]

186
00:06:53,245 --> 00:06:55,372
narrator: MICHAEL AND MAEBY 
STOPPED BY THE OFFICE

187
00:06:55,372 --> 00:06:56,749
TO SEE IF GOB NEEDED HELP

188
00:06:56,749 --> 00:06:59,043
FOR THE PARTY 
THAT WAS NOW HOURS AWAY.

189
00:06:59,043 --> 00:07:02,880
- --KING $6,300 SUIT! 
COME ON!

190
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,715
- HI THERE.

191
00:07:04,715 --> 00:07:05,883
- WHAT'S SHE DOIN' HERE?

192
00:07:05,883 --> 00:07:08,844
- MERRY CHRISTMAS TO YOU TOO, 
UNCLE GOB.

193
00:07:08,844 --> 00:07:10,471
- EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT?

194
00:07:10,471 --> 00:07:12,432
- JUST DON'T WANT 
PEOPLE'S KIDS GETTING

195
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:15,017
THEIR STICKY LITTLE FINGERS ALL 
OVER THESE $2,600 PANTS.

196
00:07:15,017 --> 00:07:16,477
- OH, YEAH, YOU THINK 
THEY'RE GONNA GO

197
00:07:16,477 --> 00:07:17,645
RIGHT FOR THE PANTS, 
DO YOU?

198
00:07:17,645 --> 00:07:18,771
- OKAY, OKAY, OKAY.

199
00:07:18,771 --> 00:07:22,775
SO, SHOULD--SHOULD--SHOULD-- 
SHOULD, SHOULD, SHOULD--

200
00:07:22,775 --> 00:07:26,946
- SHH. 
- SHOULD--SHOULD--SHOULD--

201
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:29,114
- WE'LL DO IT YOUR WAY. 
I'M JUST HERE TO HAVE FUN.

202
00:07:29,114 --> 00:07:30,240
- NOT TOO MUCH FUN, ALL RIGHT?

203
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,367
I ALREADY GAVE MY BIG 
SEXUAL HARASSMENT SPEECH TODAY.

204
00:07:32,367 --> 00:07:34,161

00:07:45,422 --> 00:07:50,636
EVEN THOUGH SO MANY PEOPLE IN 
THIS OFFICE ARE BEGGING FOR IT.

210
00:07:50,636 --> 00:07:54,640
AND IF ANYBODY DOES ANYTHING

211
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:57,893

LET'S GET THIS GOING.

00:08:01,939 --> 00:08:03,273
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? 
NOW?

215
00:08:03,273 --> 00:08:04,900
YOU'RE NOT GONNA LET THESE 
PEOPLE GO HOME

216
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:05,901
AND CHANGE THEIR CLOTHES?

217
00:08:05,901 --> 00:08:08,320
- I DON'T THINK WE NEED 
PEOPLE TRYIN' TO COMPETE

218
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:09,238
WITH WHAT I'M WEARING.

219
00:08:09,238 --> 00:08:11,741
EVERYBODY, COME OUT 
OF YOUR OFFICES, PLEASE.

220
00:08:11,741 --> 00:08:13,408
THE PARTY HAS NOW STARTED.

221
00:08:13,408 --> 00:08:15,578
HERE WE GO.

222
00:08:15,578 --> 00:08:17,079

00:08:20,207 --> 00:08:23,753
EVERYBODY DANCE NOW.

EVERYBODY DANCE NOW.

226
00:08:28,924 --> 00:08:31,761

TO A GREAT START.

227
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:34,013
narrator: AND SO, MICHAEL 
STARTED TO BECOME RELAXED,

228
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:35,097
AND A SHORT TIME LATER,

229
00:08:35,097 --> 00:08:37,266
HIS MOTHER ARRIVED 
ANYTHING BUT.

230
00:08:37,266 --> 00:08:38,475
- SOMEONE BROKE IN AGAIN.

231
00:08:38,475 --> 00:08:40,394
THE LIQUOR IS GONE. 
ALL OF IT--GONE.

232
00:08:40,394 --> 00:08:43,523
narrator: IN FACT, GOB HAD 
STOLEN IT EARLIER THAT DAY

233
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:45,733
TO CUT DOWN ON THE COST 
OF THE PARTY.

234
00:08:45,733 --> 00:08:47,026
- HEY, NEED A HAND WITH THAT?

235
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:50,195
- NO, AL. I WANNA SPILL BOOZE 
ALL OVER MY F--

236
00:08:50,195 --> 00:08:51,614
- I'M ALL ALONE THERE, MICHAEL.

237
00:08:51,614 --> 00:08:53,908
- YOU KNOW, BUSTER'S ONLY 
STATIONED ABOUT FIVE MILES AWAY.

238
00:08:53,908 --> 00:08:56,952
narrator: IN FACT, BUSTER NEVER 
WENT TO THE ARMY.

239
00:08:56,952 --> 00:08:59,580
HE'D GOTTEN HOOKED PLAYING 
THE SKILL CRANE

240
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:01,957
AND MISSED HIS FIRST DAY. 
[trilling]

241
00:09:01,957 --> 00:09:04,334
SOMEWHAT ASHAMED 
AND WITH NOWHERE TO GO,

242
00:09:04,334 --> 00:09:06,086
- HEY, BUSTER. 
narrator: HE RETURNED HOME.

243
00:09:06,086 --> 00:09:06,962
[door closes]

244
00:09:06,962 --> 00:09:08,798
- [gasps] 
BUSTER!

245
00:09:08,798 --> 00:09:10,675
THANK GOD YOU'RE BACK!

246
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:13,510
THERE'S NO SHAME 
IN BEING A COWARD.

247
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:16,513
- COWARD? 
I'M NOT A COWARD.

248
00:09:16,513 --> 00:09:18,849
WOULD A COWARD HAVE THIS?

249
00:09:18,849 --> 00:09:20,142
- WHAT THE HELL IS THAT?

250
00:09:20,142 --> 00:09:23,854
- THESE ARE MY AWARDS, MOTHER, 
FROM ARMY.

251
00:09:23,854 --> 00:09:26,231
THE SEAL 
IS FOR MARKSMANSHIP,

252
00:09:26,231 --> 00:09:29,652
AND THE GORILLA 
IS FOR SAND RACING.

253
00:09:29,652 --> 00:09:30,736
- YOU'RE DOING WELL?

254
00:09:30,736 --> 00:09:32,863
- I WAS JUST 
DROPPING THESE OFF.

255
00:09:32,863 --> 00:09:34,114
NOW, IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,

256
00:09:34,114 --> 00:09:37,326
THEY'RE PUTTING ME IN SOMETHING 
CALLED HERO SQUAD.

257
00:09:37,326 --> 00:09:38,786
- YOU HAVE NO IDEA 
WHAT IT'S LIKE

258
00:09:38,786 --> 00:09:40,663
TO BE ABANDONED BY YOUR SON.

259
00:09:40,663 --> 00:09:41,706
- DO YOU SEE MY SON?

260
00:09:41,706 --> 00:09:43,290
HE CHOSE HIS GIRLFRIEND 
OVER ME.

261
00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:44,541
- HOW THE WORM HAS TURNED.

262
00:09:44,541 --> 00:09:48,003
LOOK WHO FEELS THE STING 
OF AN UNGRATEFUL CHILD.

263
00:09:48,003 --> 00:09:50,255
- MOTHER, YOU HAVE TO RECEIVE 
SOMETHING TO BE UNGRATEFUL.

264
00:09:50,255 --> 00:09:52,424
THE POINT IS, I'M NOT GETTIN' 
WORKED UP OVER IT TONIGHT.

265
00:09:52,424 --> 00:09:53,884
I'M NOT GONNA 
LET ANYTHING BOTHER ME.

266
00:09:53,884 --> 00:09:55,595
- GOOD. I'LL GET A DRINK

267
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:59,348
AND THEN GO HOME AND WAIT 
FOR YOU TO COME STAY WITH ME.

268
00:09:59,348 --> 00:10:02,017
THANK GOD 
THEY'VE GOT MY BRANDS HERE.

269
00:10:02,017 --> 00:10:04,061
narrator: THIS WAS 
AN UNACCEPTABLE SOLUTION.

270
00:10:04,061 --> 00:10:06,731
- HEY, TOBIAS, IT'S MICHAEL. 
I HOPE YOU GET THIS.

271
00:10:06,731 --> 00:10:08,983
I NEED YOU TO 
GO OVER TO MY MOTHER'S TONIGHT.

272
00:10:08,983 --> 00:10:11,193
narrator: UNFORTUNATELY, 
TOBIAS MISSED THE CALL

273
00:10:11,193 --> 00:10:12,402
FROM THE BLUTH COMPANY

274
00:10:12,402 --> 00:10:14,404
AND IT WENT THROUGH 
TO MICHAEL'S HOME VOICE MAIL.

275
00:10:14,404 --> 00:10:15,197
- THE BLUE MEN!

276
00:10:15,197 --> 00:10:16,699
[phone beeps]

277
00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:20,285
- YOU HAVE 101 UNHEARD MESSAGES. 
FIRST MESSAGE.

278
00:10:20,285 --> 00:10:21,662
- MICHAEL, IT'S YOUR MOTHER--

279
00:10:21,662 --> 00:10:22,913

MICHAEL, PICK UP.

280
00:10:22,913 --> 00:10:25,457

282
00:10:27,417 --> 00:10:28,585

283
00:10:28,585 --> 00:10:32,673
- [groans] 
BLUTH COMPANY.

284
00:10:32,673 --> 00:10:35,550
narrator: AND LINDSAY SHOWED UP 
AT THE CHRISTMAS PARTY.

285
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:37,219
UNFORTUNATELY, SHE DIDN'T 
REALIZE

286
00:10:37,219 --> 00:10:40,139
THAT THE EMPLOYEES HAD BEEN 
THREATENED AGAINST FLIRTING.

287
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:41,223
- OH, HELLO, TED.

288
00:10:41,223 --> 00:10:44,644
OH, IF YOU'RE WORRIED 
ABOUT MY HUSBAND, IT'S FINE.

289
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:46,103
HE'S NO BIGGER THAN A CUB SCOUT.

290
00:10:46,103 --> 00:10:49,398
YOU COULD TAKE HIM, 
AND YOU COULD CERTAINLY TAKE ME.

291
00:10:49,398 --> 00:10:51,566
- THIS HAS BEEN PLEASANT 
AND PROFESSIONAL.

292
00:10:51,566 --> 00:10:53,402
GOOD LUCK 
IN THE COMING BUSINESS YEAR.

293
00:10:56,781 --> 00:10:59,616
[chuckles] HEY, YOU GUYS ARE 
STICKING STUFF ON GOB'S SUIT?

294
00:10:59,616 --> 00:11:00,826
- SHH.

295
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:03,078
GO AWAY. 
YOU'RE GONNA RUIN IT.

296
00:11:05,748 --> 00:11:08,125
- AUNT LINDSAY, 
HOW'S THE PARTY?

297
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:09,584
- IT IS THE WORST 
CHRISTMAS PARTY

298
00:11:09,584 --> 00:11:10,753
I'VE EVER BEEN TO IN MY LIFE.

299
00:11:10,753 --> 00:11:13,463
YEAH. WATCH THIS. 
[sucks teeth]

300
00:11:13,463 --> 00:11:14,757
YEP. LIKE MY LAST 10 YEARS.

301
00:11:14,757 --> 00:11:17,426
AND MY DAUGHTER WON'T 
GIVE ME THE TIME OF DAY.

302
00:11:17,426 --> 00:11:18,385
HOW WAS YOUR PARTY?

303
00:11:18,385 --> 00:11:20,137
- OH, IT WAS GOOD.

304
00:11:20,137 --> 00:11:24,308
THEY'RE KIND OF RELIGIOUS, 
ANN'S FAMILY, SO IT WAS--

305
00:11:24,308 --> 00:11:26,060
YEAH, IT WAS JUST KIND OF--

306
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:28,813
narrator: THE WORD GEORGE 
MICHAEL WAS SEARCHING FOR

307
00:11:28,813 --> 00:11:30,189
WAS "CREEPY".

308
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:31,398
[piano]

309
00:11:31,398 --> 00:11:34,026
[Ann singing out of tune]

310
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:42,659
- GIVE YOU A HAND 
WITH THAT, LITTLE FELLA.

311
00:11:42,659 --> 00:11:45,537
- [singing out of tune]

312
00:11:49,499 --> 00:11:51,126
- HEY, I WAS TALKIN' 
TO THE SOUND GUY,

313
00:11:51,126 --> 00:11:52,753
AND HE SAID 
HE'S GOT THIS KARAOKE THING.

314
00:11:52,753 --> 00:11:54,546
- YEAH. LET'S DO IT. PUT 
THE FIRST SONG ON IN THE BOOK.

315
00:11:54,546 --> 00:11:56,673
- OKAY. 
- OKAY? THANKS VERY MUCH.

316
00:11:56,673 --> 00:11:58,425
HEY. I THOUGHT YOU WERE 
AT YOUR PARTY.

317
00:11:58,425 --> 00:11:59,676
- NO, NO. 
THEY SAID I COULD LEAVE

318
00:11:59,676 --> 00:12:01,136
FOR THE SECOND HOUR 
OF SILENT PRAYER.

319
00:12:01,136 --> 00:12:02,888
BUT ANN AND I DO HAVE 
TO GO BACK, SO I SHOULD--

320
00:12:02,888 --> 00:12:04,598
I SHOULD GO SOON.

321
00:12:04,598 --> 00:12:07,226
- UNCLE MICHAEL-- 
- OKAY. I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.

322
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:10,312
SORRY. I GOTTA GO DO THIS. 
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

323
00:12:10,312 --> 00:12:12,898
narrator: AND MICHAEL 
SANG A DUET WITH HIS NIECE.

324
00:12:12,898 --> 00:12:14,358
- [singing] GONNA HOLD HER TIGHT

325
00:12:14,358 --> 00:12:17,486
GONNA GRAB SOME 
AFTERNOON DELIGHT

326
00:12:17,486 --> 00:12:20,280
- MY DAUGHTER DOESN'T NEED ME.

327
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:21,866
- NEITHER DOES MY DAD.

328
00:12:21,866 --> 00:12:24,493
narrator: HAD GEORGE MICHAEL 
AND LINDSAY STAYED,

329
00:12:24,493 --> 00:12:27,204
THEY MIGHT HAVE DISCOVERED 
WHAT MICHAEL AND MAEBY DID--

330
00:12:27,204 --> 00:12:30,665
THAT "AFTERNOON DELIGHT" 
WAS MORE ADULT-THEMED

331
00:12:30,665 --> 00:12:33,210
THAN ITS INNOCENT MELODY 
WOULD HAVE YOU BELIEVE.

332
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:35,045
- [singing] 
AND THE THOUGHT OF RUBBING YOU

333
00:12:35,045 --> 00:12:37,172
IS GETTING SO EXCITING

334
00:12:37,172 --> 00:12:40,050
- [singing] 
SKYROCKETS IN FLIGHT

335
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:41,010
- HANG ON, MAEBY.

336
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:43,178
- [singing] 
AFTERNOON DELIGHT

337
00:12:43,178 --> 00:12:44,179
- LISTEN.

338
00:12:44,179 --> 00:12:47,099
I'M GONNA GO GET SOME MORE 
PUNCH, BECAUSE IT IS TOAST TIME.

339
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:48,100
OKAY? NO, NO, NO.

340
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:50,185
IT'LL LOOK WORSE. 
GO THAT WAY.

341
00:12:51,686 --> 00:12:54,398
- SO LET'S TOAST ME. 
WHO'S FIRST?

342
00:12:55,816 --> 00:12:57,776
TOM, WHY DON'T YOU 
COME UP HERE AND TALK ABOUT ME

343
00:12:57,776 --> 00:12:59,778
FOR A FEW MINUTES?

344
00:12:59,778 --> 00:13:03,866
- UH, I WANNA THANK THE BLUTH 
FAMILY FOR HIRING ME BACK.

345
00:13:03,866 --> 00:13:05,450
IT'S BEEN A TOUGH 
COUPLE YEARS.

346
00:13:05,450 --> 00:13:07,536
- MY BROTHER DID THAT. 
TALK ABOUT ME.

347
00:13:07,536 --> 00:13:08,996
- OH, OKAY.

348
00:13:08,996 --> 00:13:12,707
UH, YOU CERTAINLY 
DO LOVE THOSE SUITS.

349
00:13:12,707 --> 00:13:14,835
- AT SEVEN GRAND, YOU'D BETTER 
BELIEVE I LOVE 'EM.

350
00:13:14,835 --> 00:13:17,421
I MEAN, 
LOOK AT WHAT YOU'RE WEARING.

351
00:13:17,421 --> 00:13:20,925
YOU LOOK LIKE CRAP. 
I MEAN, AT LEAST THIS IS--

352
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:22,634
[grunts] 
WHO DID THIS?

353
00:13:22,634 --> 00:13:25,179
[all snickering] 
YOU DO THIS, TOM?

354
00:13:25,179 --> 00:13:25,804
- NO.

355
00:13:25,804 --> 00:13:28,557
- YOU'RE A REAL SMART-ASS. 
YOU KNOW THAT, TOM?

356
00:13:28,557 --> 00:13:30,600
- LOOK, I DON'T KNOW HIM 
VERY WELL,

357
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:34,729
BUT GOB SEEMS LIKE 
HE'D BE A REALLY SMART BOSS.

358
00:13:34,729 --> 00:13:36,690
[laughter]

359
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:37,691
PLEASE DON'T LAUGH.

360
00:13:37,691 --> 00:13:40,027
LOOK, HE'S A GREAT MAGICIAN.

361
00:13:40,027 --> 00:13:41,320
[hysterical laughter]

362
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,280
- THAT'S EVEN BETTER!

363
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,614
- [bleep] YOU, TOM.

364
00:13:44,614 --> 00:13:45,615
- PLEASE DON'T.

365
00:13:45,615 --> 00:13:47,159
- YOU KNOW WHAT? 
YOU'RE FIRED.

366
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:51,621
- NO. YOU'RE ALL FIRED, 
EACH AND EVERY ONE OF YOU.

367
00:13:51,621 --> 00:13:54,083
MERRY CHRISTMAS.

368
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:55,834
- I DIDN'T KNOW THE LYRICS.

369
00:13:55,834 --> 00:13:56,919
WHERE'S EVERYBODY GOIN'?

370
00:13:56,919 --> 00:13:58,337
- WE DON'T WORK HERE ANYMORE.

371
00:13:58,337 --> 00:13:59,504
- WHAT?

372
00:13:59,504 --> 00:14:01,924
- IS YOUR SISTER STILL AROUND?

373
00:14:06,678 --> 00:14:09,639
narrator: THE CHRISTMAS PARTY 
HAD BEEN A DISASTER.

374
00:14:09,639 --> 00:14:11,183
- I DID THE RIGHT THING, 
MICHAEL.

375
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:14,519
IF I DON'T FIRE THEM, HOW DO I 
TEACH A LESSON TO THE OTHERS?

376
00:14:14,519 --> 00:14:17,064
- THERE ARE NO OTHERS. 
YOU FIRED EVERYONE.

377
00:14:17,064 --> 00:14:20,025
- OH, THAT--THAT'S GREAT.

378
00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:21,861
THE GUY WHO'S DIRTY DANCING 
WITH HIS NIECE

379
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:24,238
IS GONNA TELL THE GUY 
IN THE $3,600 SUIT

380
00:14:24,238 --> 00:14:26,866
HOW TO RUN THE BUSINESS.

381
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:28,075
COME ON.

382
00:14:28,075 --> 00:14:29,618
- I KNOW. 
MAYBE WE'RE BETTER OFF

383
00:14:29,618 --> 00:14:31,871
WITH ME BEING BUSINESSLIKE

384
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:34,289
AND YOU BEING THE GOOD-TIME, 
USELESS PARTY GUY.

385
00:14:34,289 --> 00:14:36,375
- IT GOT US THIS FAR. 
- MM-HMM.

386
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:38,127
- AND I MUST SAY THAT 
I MISS THE LAUGHTER.

387
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:40,545
OH, GOD, 
HOW THEY USED TO LAUGH WITH ME.

388
00:14:40,545 --> 00:14:43,382
- AT YOU. WE GOTTA FIGURE OUT A 
WAY TO HIRE EVERYBODY BACK.

389
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:45,384
A MEETING. 
- A PARTY.

390
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:46,551
- NO. WE JUST HAD A PARTY.

391
00:14:46,551 --> 00:14:48,428
- YEAH, BUT I DIDN'T GET 
TO HAVE ANY FUN.

392
00:14:48,428 --> 00:14:51,348
narrator: SO MICHAEL WENT TO 
WORK ON ANOTHER CHRISTMAS PARTY,

393
00:14:51,348 --> 00:14:53,267
THIS TIME WITH THE HELP 
OF HIS NIECE.

394
00:14:53,267 --> 00:14:54,894
- I REALLY APPRECIATE 
YOU DOING THIS.

395
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:56,395
I DIDN'T WANNA 
ASK GEORGE MICHAEL.

396
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:58,813
I MEAN, DID YOU SEE THAT HE 
SHOWED UP AT THE PARTY

397
00:14:58,813 --> 00:15:01,108
FOR FIVE MINUTES AND LEFT 
WITHOUT EVEN SAYING GOOD-BYE?

398
00:15:01,108 --> 00:15:03,860
- HEY, MY MOM DOESN'T EVEN WANNA 
BE IN THE SAME ROOM WITH ME.

399
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:07,948
- MICHAEL, I WAS ALMOST ATTACKED 
LAST NIGHT IN MY OWN HOME.

400
00:15:07,948 --> 00:15:10,242
I WALK IN, AND THERE'S A COLORED 
MAN IN MY KITCHEN.

401
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:12,411
- "COLORED"? 
WHAT COLOR WAS HE EXACTLY?

402
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:14,163
- BLUE.

403
00:15:14,163 --> 00:15:16,790
- HELLO, LUCILLE.

404
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:18,417
[horn blares]

405
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:20,044
- I SENT HIM TO YOUR HOUSE 
TO KEEP YOU SAFE.

406
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:22,254
- WELL, HE DID A TERRIBLE JOB. 
DIDN'T HE?

407
00:15:22,254 --> 00:15:23,923
I NEED SOMEONE ELSE, 
SOMEONE BETTER.

408
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:27,217
WHAT ABOUT THIS ONE? 
SHE'S GOT THICK ARMS.

409
00:15:27,217 --> 00:15:29,011
- MOM, YOU JUST NEED 
TO CALM DOWN A LITTLE BIT.

410
00:15:29,011 --> 00:15:30,429
YOU'RE SO TENSE.

411
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:32,514
- HOW AM I SUPPOSED 
TO CALM DOWN?

412
00:15:32,514 --> 00:15:33,848
- SOUNDS TENSE.

413
00:15:33,848 --> 00:15:37,102
THAT MEANS SHE'S NOT GETTIN' ANY 
FROM MY BROTHER OSCAR.

414
00:15:37,102 --> 00:15:39,354
- I MEAN, MAYBE I SHOULD 
MOVE IN WITH YOU.

415
00:15:39,354 --> 00:15:40,814
narrator: AND MICHAEL REALIZED

416
00:15:40,814 --> 00:15:42,399
HE NEEDED TO RETRIEVE 
HIS UNCLE OSCAR.

417
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:44,693
- HOW WOULD YOU LIKE 
TO GO ON A ROAD TRIP?

418
00:15:44,693 --> 00:15:47,404
- NO. I WANNA STAY HERE 
WITH HER. LET'S GO.

419
00:15:47,404 --> 00:15:50,699
narrator: AND SO THE TWO OF THEM 
PREPARED TO DRIVE UP THE COAST.

420
00:15:50,699 --> 00:15:52,409
- OKAY, YOU'RE IN CHARGE 
OF THE RADIO,

421
00:15:52,409 --> 00:15:54,619
AND WE'RE NOT STOPPING 
UNTIL WE FIND UNCLE OSCAR.

422
00:15:54,619 --> 00:15:55,870
- THERE HE IS.

423
00:15:57,831 --> 00:15:59,208
- MY MOM IS VERY STRESSED OUT,

424
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:03,295
AND SHE NEEDS SOMETHING 
THAT I CAN'T GIVE HER--

425
00:16:03,295 --> 00:16:06,631
UM, MAYBE A LITTLE 
AFTERNOON DELIGHT.

426
00:16:06,631 --> 00:16:08,842
narrator: OSCAR THOUGHT THAT 
MICHAEL WAS REFERRING TO

427
00:16:08,842 --> 00:16:11,971
A PARTICULAR BRAND OF CANNABIS 
NAMED AFTERNOON DEELITE,

428
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:14,306
A STRAIN FAMOUS FOR 
SLOWING BEHAVIOR.

429
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:17,267
- WELL, SURE. 
THE QUESTION IS,

430
00:16:17,267 --> 00:16:21,355
WHICH WAY DO I TRY 
TO GET IT IN HER?

431
00:16:21,355 --> 00:16:23,398
- I DON'T NEED ANY DETAILS.

432
00:16:23,398 --> 00:16:25,109
- MAYBE I'LL PUT IT 
IN HER BROWNIE.

433
00:16:25,109 --> 00:16:26,610
- HEY!

434
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:28,988
- WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?

435
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:29,989
- WHAT?

436
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:31,115
[loudly] OH, OH. MY EARS.

437
00:16:31,115 --> 00:16:35,452
THE DOCTOR SAID I CAN'T 
GO TO SLEEP FOR FIVE HOURS,

438
00:16:35,452 --> 00:16:38,497
OR I MIGHT DIE 
OR SOMETHING.

439
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:44,294
OH, I GOT BLOWN, 
SO I CAN'T SLEEP.

440
00:16:44,294 --> 00:16:46,630
- HEY, HAVE YOU SEEN MAEBY?

441
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:47,881
- YOU'RE NOT GONNA BELIEVE THIS.

442
00:16:47,881 --> 00:16:49,966
APPARENTLY MY DAD AND MAEBY 
TOOK A DRIVE UP THE COAST.

443
00:16:49,966 --> 00:16:51,051
- YOU'RE KIDDING ME.

444
00:16:51,051 --> 00:16:53,512
- UH-OH. I SHOULD 
NOT HAVE PICKED AT THAT.

445
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:54,429
THAT'S BLOOD.

446
00:16:54,429 --> 00:16:55,722
- THIS IS RIDICULOUS.

447
00:16:55,722 --> 00:16:56,931
SO SHE'S GOT A NEW PARENT.

448
00:16:56,931 --> 00:16:58,600
- YEAH. NOW MY DAD'S 
GOT A NEW KID.

449
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:02,646
- I'M GONNA LIE DOWN 
FOR A LITTLE BIT, BUT JUST--

450
00:17:02,646 --> 00:17:04,356
I C--I CAN'T FALL--

451
00:17:06,816 --> 00:17:10,487
- HEY, HOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO 
COME TO THE PARTY WITH ME TODAY?

452
00:17:10,487 --> 00:17:12,447
narrator: AND OSCAR 
WAS GIVING LUCILLE

453
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:13,948
A LITTLE AFTERNOON DEELITE.

454
00:17:13,948 --> 00:17:15,909
- THESE ARE REALLY DELICIOUS.

455
00:17:15,909 --> 00:17:17,494
- I'LL GET SOME MORE.

456
00:17:17,494 --> 00:17:20,580
- [singing] OKAY

457
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:23,125
MM-HMM

458
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:26,170
- WHERE DID SHE GO?

459
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:28,755
narrator: AND SOON, THE SECOND 
BLUTH COMPANY CHRISTMAS PARTY

460
00:17:28,755 --> 00:17:30,340
IN AS MANY DAYS BEGAN.

461
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:31,508
- YOU ARE NOT FIRED, SIR.

462
00:17:31,508 --> 00:17:33,052
- I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT.

463
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:34,719
- YOU GOT IT. 
HERE YOU GO. MERRY CHRISTMAS.

464
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:35,929
WHERE THE HELL IS MY BROTHER?

465
00:17:35,929 --> 00:17:38,557
- SURE, THE GUY 
IN THE $600 BANANA SUIT.

466
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:40,975
COME ON!

467
00:17:40,975 --> 00:17:42,477
- HI.

468
00:17:42,477 --> 00:17:44,896
[suit squeaking]

469
00:17:47,524 --> 00:17:48,650
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING?

470
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:50,735
- HEY, DON'T BE MAD AT ME 'CAUSE 
YOU DIDN'T THINK ABOUT

471
00:17:50,735 --> 00:17:52,571
GETTING UP AT 6:00 A.M. 
AND GOING OUT TO TARZANA

472
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:54,323
TO GET THE OLD BANANA SUIT 
OUT OF STORAGE.

473
00:17:54,323 --> 00:17:55,199
BUT IT'S WORTH IT,

474
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:57,701
BECAUSE IT'S TIME FOR ME 
TO MAKE PEOPLE LAUGH AGAIN.

475
00:17:57,701 --> 00:17:59,744
WITH ME.

476
00:17:59,744 --> 00:18:03,707
AND WHAT'S FUNNIER THAN A GUY 
IN--OH--HEY, WAIT. HEY.

477
00:18:03,707 --> 00:18:05,459
[laughing, 
Gob continues shouting]

478
00:18:06,626 --> 00:18:10,172
OKAY. 
[laughter]

479
00:18:12,382 --> 00:18:15,009
narrator: LATER, GOB WAS 
INSIDE THE BANANA STAND,

480
00:18:15,009 --> 00:18:16,720
AND IT WAS GETTING PRETTY HOT 
IN THERE,

481
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:19,348
SO HE DECIDED 
TO LOSE A LAYER.

482
00:18:19,348 --> 00:18:21,475
- HEY, LOOK. THERE'S YOUR MOM 
AND GEORGE MICHAEL.

483
00:18:21,475 --> 00:18:23,810
I GUESS THEY DID 
COME TO SUPPORT US AFTER ALL.

484
00:18:23,810 --> 00:18:24,853
- LOOK AT THAT.

485
00:18:24,853 --> 00:18:27,021
THEY'RE ALL OVER EACH OTHER 
WITH THEIR LITTLE SECRETS.

486
00:18:27,021 --> 00:18:29,691
- WHAT CAN YOU DO, RIGHT? 
- YEAH.

487
00:18:29,691 --> 00:18:32,819
HOW WOULD YOU FEEL 
ABOUT SINGING A LITTLE KARAOKE?

488
00:18:32,819 --> 00:18:34,154
narrator: UNFORTUNATELY,

489
00:18:34,154 --> 00:18:36,573
LINDSAY WASN'T THERE TO SEE ALL 
OF MICHAEL AND MAEBY'S SONG

490
00:18:36,573 --> 00:18:38,992
AND WAS ABOUT 
TO HAVE A SIMILAR REVELATION.

491
00:18:38,992 --> 00:18:41,077
- [singing] COULD NOT BE CAUGHT 
THAT DIDN'T BITE

492
00:18:41,077 --> 00:18:44,248
BUT YOU GOT SOME BAIT 
A-WAITIN', AND I THINK I MIGHT

493
00:18:44,248 --> 00:18:45,874
TRY NIBBLING 
A LITTLE AFTERNOON DELIGHT

494
00:18:45,874 --> 00:18:46,916
- THAT'S MY WIFE AND NEPHEW.

495
00:18:46,916 --> 00:18:48,418
- [singing] SKYROCKETS IN FLIGHT

496
00:18:48,418 --> 00:18:51,255
- WE HAVE 
AN OPEN RELATIONSHIP.

497
00:18:51,255 --> 00:18:56,301
narrator: JUST THEN, LUCILLE 
ARRIVED CRAVING A FROZEN BANANA.

498
00:18:56,301 --> 00:18:58,387
AND THE EFFECTS OF LINDSAY 
AND GEORGE MICHAEL'S

499
00:18:58,387 --> 00:19:00,472
"AFTERNOON DELIGHT" 
WAS OVERSHADOWED--

500
00:19:00,472 --> 00:19:01,848
- MOM? 
narrator: BY THE EFFECTS

501
00:19:01,848 --> 00:19:03,683
OF OSCAR AND LUCILLE'S 
AFTERNOON DEELITE.

502
00:19:03,683 --> 00:19:05,101
- TOBIAS--TOBIAS, WATCH OUT.

503
00:19:05,101 --> 00:19:07,103
narrator: TOBIAS COULDN'T HEAR-- 
- TOBIAS!

504
00:19:07,103 --> 00:19:10,064
narrator: AND DIDN'T MANAGE TO 
GET OUT OF THE WAY IN TIME.

505
00:19:10,064 --> 00:19:12,234
- WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT? 
[thud]

506
00:19:12,234 --> 00:19:14,027
narrator: 
AND GOB COULDN'T MOVE FREELY.

507
00:19:14,027 --> 00:19:16,571
LUCILLE TRIED 
TO COME TO A STOP,

508
00:19:16,571 --> 00:19:18,615
BUT THE CAR 
HIT GOB'S BANANA PEEL.

509
00:19:18,615 --> 00:19:21,951
[goofy laughter]

510
00:19:21,951 --> 00:19:24,204
[wood crashing]

511
00:19:24,204 --> 00:19:26,415
- I CAN'T GET OUT OF HERE. 
I'M STUCK.

512
00:19:26,415 --> 00:19:28,792
- MOM, ARE YOU CRAZY? YOU 
COULD'VE KILLED SOMEBODY.

513
00:19:28,792 --> 00:19:33,297
- HEY, MIKEY, RELAX. 
IT'S JUST A GIANT BANANA.

514
00:19:33,297 --> 00:19:37,133
narrator: AND THAT'S WHEN BUSTER 
SAW AN OPPORTUNITY TO BE A HERO.

515
00:19:37,133 --> 00:19:39,553
- GOB? 
- MOM, I'M STUCK!

516
00:19:39,553 --> 00:19:41,471
- I GOT YOU, BROTHER!

517
00:19:41,471 --> 00:19:44,891
[engine revving]

518
00:19:44,891 --> 00:19:46,185
[giddy laughter]

519
00:19:50,104 --> 00:19:52,316
[laughter]

520
00:19:52,316 --> 00:19:55,360
narrator: AND FOR THE SECOND 
TIME SINCE HE BECAME PRESIDENT,

521
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,904
GOB HEARD THE SWEET SOUND 
OF LAUGHTER.

522
00:19:57,904 --> 00:19:59,906
- THEY'RE LAUGHING WITH ME, 
MICHAEL.

523
00:19:59,906 --> 00:20:02,367
THEY'RE LAUGHING WITH ME!

524
00:20:04,077 --> 00:20:07,497
narrator: UNFORTUNATELY, 
BUSTER'S NEWFOUND SKILLS

525
00:20:07,497 --> 00:20:10,375
DID NOT INVOLVE 
LOWERING GENTLY.

526
00:20:11,626 --> 00:20:13,212
- OOH. OH.

527
00:20:17,591 --> 00:20:18,675
- HEY, IT'S TOBIAS.

528
00:20:18,675 --> 00:20:21,678
WHO WANTS TO TAKE ME 
TO THE HOSPITAL?

529
00:20:21,678 --> 00:20:24,639
narrator: 
AND SO FATHER AND SON REUNITE,

530
00:20:24,639 --> 00:20:26,850
REBUILDING THE BANANA STAND 
FOR A SECOND TIME.

531
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:28,727
- HEY. CAN I GIVE YOU A HAND?

532
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:30,854
- HEY. YEAH.

533
00:20:30,854 --> 00:20:32,188
THAT'D BE GREAT. 
- OKAY.

534
00:20:34,816 --> 00:20:36,985
OH, I'M SORRY ABOUT-- 
IT'S EMBARRASSING, THE WHOLE--

535
00:20:36,985 --> 00:20:39,279
- LISTEN, I, UH--

536
00:20:39,279 --> 00:20:40,780
I'VE BEEN A LITTLE OUT OF LINE 
LATELY.

537
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:42,741
YOU'RE ENTITLED 
TO BE WITH YOUR GIRLFRIEND,

538
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:44,284
AND I GUESS I GOT 
A LITTLE BIT JEALOUS.

539
00:20:44,284 --> 00:20:47,412
- YEAH. WELL, ME TOO. 
- YEAH.

540
00:20:47,412 --> 00:20:48,955
- OKAY.

541
00:20:52,083 --> 00:20:55,962
[Michael whistling 
"Afternoon Delight"]

542
00:20:55,962 --> 00:20:59,383
- [both singing] 
GONNA GRAB SOME AFTERNOON--

543
00:20:59,383 --> 00:21:01,175
- IT DOES NOT SEEM LIKE 
IT WOULD BE THAT DIRTY.

544
00:21:01,175 --> 00:21:03,428
- IT'S--IT IS CATCHY. 
RIGHT. THAT'S THE THING.

545
00:21:03,428 --> 00:21:06,055
narrator: ON THE NEXT 
"ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT."

546
00:21:06,055 --> 00:21:09,268
THE BLUE MAN GROUP 
FINALLY CALLS FOR TOBIAS

547
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:11,478
WITH A LIFE-CHANGING 
OPPORTUNITY.

548
00:21:12,937 --> 00:21:16,900
UNFORTUNATELY, HE CAN'T HEAR IT, 
AND HIS LIFE STAYS THE SAME.
