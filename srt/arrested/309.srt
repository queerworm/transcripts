00:00:01,417 --> 00:00:04,837
announcer: TONIGHT, AN ARRESTED 
DEVELOPMENT YOU CAN'T MISS.

2
00:00:04,837 --> 00:00:06,922
A CAVALCADE OF STARS.

3
00:00:06,922 --> 00:00:11,386
THE SHOCKING FINAL MOMENTS 
WILL BE PRESENTED LIVE.

4
00:00:11,386 --> 00:00:13,554
AND ONE OF THESE PEOPLE...

5
00:00:15,848 --> 00:00:17,433
WILL DIE.

6
00:00:19,852 --> 00:00:21,396
narrator: 
THE BLUTHS WERE DESPERATE.

7
00:00:21,396 --> 00:00:22,522
- I ASSUME YOU'VE SEEN THIS.

8
00:00:22,522 --> 00:00:24,774
THE PRESS HAD THEM 
ALL BUT FINISHED.

9
00:00:24,774 --> 00:00:26,025
- WHAT? 
WHAT IS IT?

10
00:00:26,025 --> 00:00:27,235
- THIS ISN'T GONNA WORK 
OVER THE PHONE, DAD.

11
00:00:27,235 --> 00:00:29,529
- THEN GET BOB LOBLAW TO HIRE ME 
ANOTHER SURROGATE.

12
00:00:29,529 --> 00:00:30,780
- THAT'S KIND OF THE POINT.

13
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:32,240
MR. LOBLAW NO LONGER 
WORKS FOR US...

14
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:35,160
BECAUSE SOMEONE 
WANTED A BOYFRIEND.

15
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:36,411
- WELL, DON'T BLAME ME.

16
00:00:36,411 --> 00:00:37,703
- I WAS TALKING TO LINDSAY, 
ACTUALLY.

17
00:00:37,703 --> 00:00:40,373
BUT HE WAS CLEARLY TURNED OFF 
TO THE BOTH OF YOU.

18
00:00:40,373 --> 00:00:41,749
NOW, WE'RE GONNA NEED A NEW 
LAWYER.

19
00:00:41,749 --> 00:00:45,878
AND THAT IS GOING TO 
MEAN ABOUT A $100,000 RETAINER.

20
00:00:45,878 --> 00:00:47,713
IF WE WANT A CHANCE 
OF KEEPING THIS FAMILY GOING

21
00:00:47,713 --> 00:00:49,715
PAST THE NEXT FEW WEEKS,

22
00:00:49,715 --> 00:00:52,177
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO PULL OUT 
ALL THE STOPS.

23
00:00:52,177 --> 00:00:53,428
WHAT AM I TALKING ABOUT?

24
00:00:53,428 --> 00:00:56,722
I'M TALKING ABOUT ALL OF YOU 
GETTING JOBS.

25
00:00:56,722 --> 00:00:58,015
- THE BEST PLACE TO LOOK FOR A 
JOB--

26
00:00:58,015 --> 00:01:00,601
- EW! 
- WHO THREW THE TOMATO?

27
00:01:00,601 --> 00:01:02,770
- HOW THE HELL ARE WE 
GONNA GET A HUNDRED GRAND?

28
00:01:02,770 --> 00:01:04,855
- WELL, I KNOW THIS ISN'T 
EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR,

29
00:01:04,855 --> 00:01:07,650
BUT MAEBY WAS JUST ACCEPTED 
INTO PRIVATE SCHOOL.

30
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:08,901
I'VE SENT THE CHECK IN ALREADY.

31
00:01:08,901 --> 00:01:10,736
- NO, THAT'S NOT WHAT 
I'M LOOKIN' FOR AT ALL.

32
00:01:10,736 --> 00:01:12,155
- MICHAEL, IT'S THE MOST 
PRESTIGIOUS

33
00:01:12,155 --> 00:01:13,156
PRIVATE SCHOOL IN TOWN.

34
00:01:13,156 --> 00:01:14,865
- OH, NO. 
NOT THE MILFORD ACADEMY.

35
00:01:14,865 --> 00:01:17,868
narrator: CHILDREN WERE NEITHER 
TO BE SEEN NOR HEARD...

36
00:01:17,868 --> 00:01:19,870
AT THE SCHOOL BUSTER 
HAD ATTENDED.

37
00:01:19,870 --> 00:01:24,250
- IT'S THE EXACT OPPOSITE. 
IT'S CALLED "OPENINGS."

38
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:25,501
- OH, GREAT.

39
00:01:25,501 --> 00:01:27,753
THAT SOUNDS LIKE ANOTHER ONE OF 
THOSE GRADELESS, STRUCTURELESS,

40
00:01:27,753 --> 00:01:29,755
NEW AGE "FEEL-GOODERIES."

41
00:01:29,755 --> 00:01:31,006
- THEY TEACH SELF-EXPRESSION

42
00:01:31,006 --> 00:01:33,218
AND GETTING IN TOUCH 
WITH FEELINGS, MICHAEL.

43
00:01:33,218 --> 00:01:34,385
I MEAN, I KNOW 
YOU DON'T HAVE ANY.

44
00:01:34,385 --> 00:01:36,053
- THE BOY WHO COULDN'T CRY.

45
00:01:36,053 --> 00:01:38,055
- HE'S A ROBOT!

46
00:01:38,055 --> 00:01:40,516
- OH, MICHAEL CAN CRY. 
HE JUST DOESN'T WANNA RUST.

47
00:01:40,516 --> 00:01:43,478
- YES, HE'S LIKE THE STEEL MAN 
FROM THE WIZARD OF OZ.

48
00:01:43,478 --> 00:01:45,688
- TIN MAN? 
- IS THAT WHAT HE'S CALLED?

49
00:01:45,688 --> 00:01:47,232
- HE KNOWS.

50
00:01:47,232 --> 00:01:48,483
- YOU KNOW, LINDSAY, SINCE YOU 
SENT THE CHECK,

51
00:01:48,483 --> 00:01:49,484
THIS IS HOW 
YOU'RE GONNA PAY FOR IT.

52
00:01:49,484 --> 00:01:51,277
YOU'RE GONNA BE IN CHARGE 
OF THE HOUSE FROM NOW ON.

53
00:01:51,277 --> 00:01:52,528
OKAY?  THE COOKING, 
CLEANING, ALL OF IT.

54
00:01:52,528 --> 00:01:54,614
- YOU'RE GOING TO PUT LINDSAY 
IN CHARGE OF THE COOKING?

55
00:01:54,614 --> 00:01:56,073
AT LEAST YOU'LL LOSE WEIGHT.

56
00:01:56,073 --> 00:01:57,325
- YOU KNOW, MOM,

57
00:01:57,325 --> 00:01:58,326
I THINK THE ONLY 
TIME YOU EVER COOKED FOR US

58
00:01:58,326 --> 00:01:59,994
WAS THE MORNING ROSA'S MOM DIED.

59
00:01:59,994 --> 00:02:02,079
- YOU GAVE US CEREAL 
IN AN ASHTRAY.

60
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:04,374
- GOB, PAL? HOW ABOUT YOU? 
CAN YOU FIND SOME WORK?

61
00:02:04,374 --> 00:02:06,501
- OH, SURE, MICHAEL.

62
00:02:06,501 --> 00:02:08,669
AS WHAT? 
A WAITER?

63
00:02:08,669 --> 00:02:10,838
CAN I GET YOU SOMETHING, 
MADAM?

64
00:02:10,838 --> 00:02:14,175
- [laughing] 
- [George laughs]

65
00:02:14,175 --> 00:02:16,552
- I WILL HAVE A VODKA, THOUGH. 
- WHAT? OH.

66
00:02:16,552 --> 00:02:18,012
- YOU KNOW, IF YOU'D EVER 
ACCIDENTALLY

67
00:02:18,012 --> 00:02:19,347
WORKED A DAY IN YOUR LIFE,

68
00:02:19,347 --> 00:02:20,723
YOU'D KNOW THERE'S NO 
INDIGNITY IN IT.

69
00:02:20,723 --> 00:02:22,142
- GREAT. 
SHE'LL HAVE A VODKA.

70
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:25,936
- INSTEAD OF SELLING OUT, 
BECOMING HOUSEWIVES AND WAITERS,

71
00:02:25,936 --> 00:02:27,230
WHY DON'T WE HAVE 
A BIG EVENT?

72
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:30,900
SOME SORT OF "SAVE OUR BLUTHS" 
TYPE THING.

73
00:02:32,777 --> 00:02:35,196
WE'LL THROW A LEGAL DEFENSE FUND 
DINNER. ASK FOR DONATIONS.

74
00:02:35,196 --> 00:02:38,241
- AS LONG AS WE DON'T 
LOOK DESPERATE.

75
00:02:38,241 --> 00:02:41,118
WE WANT 'EM TO THINK WE'LL TAKE 
THEIR HELP, BUT DON'T NEED IT.

76
00:02:41,118 --> 00:02:43,120
I SHOULD BE SEEN 
A LOT AT THE CLUB.

77
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,580
- YEAH, OUR BACKS ARE 
AGAINST THE WALL,

78
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:46,123
AND IT'S 
JUST HARD TO ACCEPT...

79
00:02:46,123 --> 00:02:48,125
THAT IT'S REALLY 
COME TO BEGGING.

80
00:02:48,125 --> 00:02:50,753
- SOMETIMES IT'S THE ONLY WAY 
TO STAY IN THE GAME.

81
00:02:50,753 --> 00:02:53,130
narrator: PLEASE TELL YOUR 
FRIENDS ABOUT THIS SHOW.

82
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:55,591
[whistling]

83
00:03:02,973 --> 00:03:04,392
narrator: 
MICHAEL HAD ASKED LINDSAY

84
00:03:04,392 --> 00:03:06,436
TO TAKE CARE OF THE HOUSE.

85
00:03:06,436 --> 00:03:08,854
AND TO HIS SURPRISE, 
SHE WAS SORT OF DOING IT.

86
00:03:08,854 --> 00:03:10,064
- YOU'RE SORT OF DOING IT.

87
00:03:10,064 --> 00:03:11,106
- YEAH, CHECK IT OUT.

88
00:03:11,106 --> 00:03:13,568
I FOUND THAT CANNED HAM 
THAT WE'D HAD FOREVER,

89
00:03:13,568 --> 00:03:15,736
AND I PUT IT IN A POT 
OF BOILING WATER.

90
00:03:15,736 --> 00:03:17,572
AND GUESS WHAT I'M CALLING IT? 
- SOUP?

91
00:03:17,572 --> 00:03:19,031
- HOT HAM WATER. 
YOU KNOW, I'M ACTUALLY

92
00:03:19,031 --> 00:03:21,576
A REALLY GOOD MOM.

93
00:03:21,576 --> 00:03:23,661
I THINK IT'S 'CAUSE 
MAEBY'S NEVER AROUND.

94
00:03:23,661 --> 00:03:26,163
YOU SHOULD SEND GEORGE MICHAEL 
TO "OPENINGS" TOO.

95
00:03:26,163 --> 00:03:28,291
- YES, IT COULD HELP HIM 
EXPRESS HIS FEELINGS.

96
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:30,585
- MY SON EXPRESSES HIMSELF 
JUST FINE.

97
00:03:30,585 --> 00:03:31,836
ISN'T THAT RIGHT, SON?

98
00:03:31,836 --> 00:03:33,421
- WHAT? 
YEAH, IT'S FINE.

99
00:03:33,421 --> 00:03:35,590
YEAH, I GUESS. 
I DON'T CARE. STOP.

100
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:38,343
- YES. HE'S A REGULAR 
FREDDY WILSON, THAT ONE.

101
00:03:38,343 --> 00:03:41,304
- I DON'T KNOW THAT REFERENCE. 
- NO, I DON'T EITHER.

102
00:03:41,304 --> 00:03:43,848
- OH, I DON'T KNOW EITHER.

103
00:03:43,848 --> 00:03:45,099
- narrator: IT'S THIS GUY.

104
00:03:45,099 --> 00:03:46,892
- MY SON'S FINE WHERE HE IS.

105
00:03:46,892 --> 00:03:48,143
HE'S GOT THE S.A.T.'S COMING UP.

106
00:03:48,143 --> 00:03:49,604
YOU GOTTA DO WELL ON THOSE. 
YOU STUDYING UPSTAIRS?

107
00:03:49,604 --> 00:03:52,482
- YEAH, I'M TAKING A THREE REAL 
QUICK SO I CAN GET A CREAM SODA.

108
00:03:52,482 --> 00:03:53,733
- OH, I'LL GET THAT FOR YOU.

109
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:55,235
- NO, I WILL GET IT. 
I HAVE TO GET IT MYSELF.

110
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:58,195
JUST RELAX.

111
00:03:58,195 --> 00:04:01,073
JUST CHECK THE STOVE 
REAL QUICK.

112
00:04:01,073 --> 00:04:02,325
- YOU KNOW, MICHAEL,

113
00:04:02,325 --> 00:04:04,201
IF I MAY TAKE OFF MY ACTING 
PANTS FOR A MOMENT...

114
00:04:04,201 --> 00:04:07,121
AND PULL MY "ANALRAPIST" 
STOCKING OVER MY HEAD,

115
00:04:07,121 --> 00:04:09,665
GEORGE MICHAEL HAS BEEN 
ACTING STRANGE LATELY.

116
00:04:18,048 --> 00:04:20,260
I THINK HE MAY HAVE DEVELOPED 
WHAT WE IN THE SOFT SCIENCES..

117
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:22,637
REFER TO AS OBSESSIVE-COMPULSIVE 
DISORDER...

118
00:04:22,637 --> 00:04:25,681
OR THE O.C. DISORDER. 
- DON'T CALL IT THAT.

119
00:04:25,681 --> 00:04:26,974
- I THINK ULTIMATELY IT'S 
BECAUSE

120
00:04:26,974 --> 00:04:29,519
HE'S AFRAID TO EXPRESS HIMSELF.

121
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:30,770
narrator: ACTUALLY, 
IT WAS BECAUSE

122
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:32,522
HE WAS 
AFRAID HIS AUNT LINDSAY

123
00:04:32,522 --> 00:04:34,148
WAS GOING TO BURN 
THE HOUSE DOWN.

124
00:04:34,148 --> 00:04:35,858
- HI. 
HOW ARE YOU?

125
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:43,324
CREAM SODA.

126
00:04:43,324 --> 00:04:46,035
MAYBE HE DOES NEED THIS SCHOOL. 
DID YOU SEE THIS LETTER?

127
00:04:46,035 --> 00:04:47,662
YOU KNOW, IT'S DONE 
WONDERS FOR MAEBY.

128
00:04:47,662 --> 00:04:49,246
- "MAEBY IS AN EXCEPTIONAL 
YOUNG LADY."

129
00:04:49,246 --> 00:04:50,247
- EXCEPTIONAL.

130
00:04:50,247 --> 00:04:52,417
"WE ARE SURE THAT SHE IS 
DESTINED FOR GREAT THINGS."

131
00:04:52,417 --> 00:04:53,668
- GREAT THINGS.

132
00:04:53,668 --> 00:04:55,670
- "AND WE WISH HER LUCK 
IN ALL HER"--

133
00:04:57,922 --> 00:04:59,173
IT SAYS "OVER."

134
00:04:59,173 --> 00:05:00,675
I'D PROBABLY HAVE TO CRACK THIS 
OPEN TO BE SURE,

135
00:05:00,675 --> 00:05:02,635
BUT THIS SOUNDS LIKE 
AN EXPULSION LETTER.

136
00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:04,637
"SHE'S NEVER 
BEEN TO CLASS."

137
00:05:04,637 --> 00:05:05,888
- WHAT KIND OF A BOARDING SCHOOL

138
00:05:05,888 --> 00:05:07,014
WOULD LOSE TRACK OF ITS 
STUDENTS?

139
00:05:07,014 --> 00:05:08,391
- OPENINGS IS NOT 
A BOARDING SCHOOL.

140
00:05:08,391 --> 00:05:10,267
- I THOUGHT IT WAS 
A BOARDING SCHOOL TOO.

141
00:05:10,267 --> 00:05:12,395
narrator: ACTUALLY, MAEBY 
HAD BEEN ON THE SET OF A FILM

142
00:05:12,395 --> 00:05:14,271
CALLED SNOWBOARDING SCHOOL 2.

143
00:05:14,271 --> 00:05:17,066
IN HER SECRET LIFE 
AS A FILM EXECUTIVE.

144
00:05:17,066 --> 00:05:19,444
- THERE GOES THAT 
NONREFUNDABLE TUITION.

145
00:05:19,444 --> 00:05:21,404
YOU KNOW IT IS THE ONE RULE 
THEY DO HAVE THERE.

146
00:05:21,404 --> 00:05:22,863
- SHE SHOULD BE PUNISHED 
FOR THIS.

147
00:05:22,863 --> 00:05:23,864
YOU KNOW, TOBIAS,

148
00:05:23,864 --> 00:05:25,450
IF I CAN BECOME A MORE 
TRADITIONAL MOTHER,

149
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:27,284
THEN MAYBE 
YOU COULD START BEING MORE OF--

150
00:05:27,284 --> 00:05:29,495
- NONTRADITIONAL MOTHER. 
YES, YOU'RE RIGHT.

151
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:31,497
AFTER ALL, 
I AM HER FATHER.

152
00:05:31,497 --> 00:05:34,208
- THE CARS ARE STILL OFF, AND I 
REWASHED ALL THE CLOTHES.

153
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:35,876
narrator: AND THAT'S WHEN 
MICHAEL DECIDED

154
00:05:35,876 --> 00:05:37,127
THAT PERHAPS MAEBY'S TUITION

155
00:05:37,127 --> 00:05:39,714
DIDN'T HAVE TO GO TO WASTE 
AFTER ALL.

156
00:05:39,714 --> 00:05:41,924
MEANWHILE, 
LUCILLE WENT TO WORK

157
00:05:41,924 --> 00:05:43,509
SOLICITING FOR 
THE BLUTH FUND-RAISER.

158
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:45,344
- I MEAN, WE HAVE PLENTY OF 
MONEY.

159
00:05:45,344 --> 00:05:46,596
DON'T GET ME WRONG.

160
00:05:46,596 --> 00:05:50,182
BUT WE CAN'T USE OUR PERSONAL 
ASSETS TO DEFEND THE COMPANY.

161
00:05:50,182 --> 00:05:53,436
narrator: JUST THEN, GOB ARRIVED 
AND DECIDED TO HAVE A LAUGH.

162
00:05:53,436 --> 00:05:56,522
- YOUR DRINK, MADAM. 
[chuckles]

163
00:05:56,522 --> 00:05:58,608
CAN I GET YOU ANYTHING-- 
- GET THAT ONE OUT OF HERE.

164
00:05:58,608 --> 00:06:00,610
- AS YOU PLEASE.

165
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:03,278
narrator: BUT LUCILLE HAD NEVER 
MADE EYE CONTACT WITH A WAITER.

166
00:06:03,278 --> 00:06:04,530
- CAN YOU DROP 
THESE OFF AT TWO?

167
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:06,115
- WHY NOT?

168
00:06:06,115 --> 00:06:09,159
I'M JUST A WAITER. 
[laughs]

169
00:06:09,159 --> 00:06:12,580
- narrator: SO HE KEPT IT UP. 
- WE'RE ALL OUT OF THE HALIBUT.

170
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:13,831
narrator: THE JOKE WAS OVER,

171
00:06:13,831 --> 00:06:16,917
BUT THE LUNCH RUSH 
WAS JUST BEGINNING.

172
00:06:16,917 --> 00:06:18,503
- HEY, NEW GUY. 
YOU WANNA SEAT TABLE FOUR?

173
00:06:18,503 --> 00:06:19,587
- WHAT'LL YOU HAVE?

174
00:06:19,587 --> 00:06:22,923
narrator: BACK AT THE PENTHOUSE, 
HOWEVER, LUNCH WAS LONG OVERDUE.

175
00:06:22,923 --> 00:06:25,551
- I DON'T SUPPOSE SHE LEFT 
ANYTHING FOR ME TO EAT.

176
00:06:25,551 --> 00:06:26,844
- NO, JUST A SOUP AND A HALF 
SANDWICH

177
00:06:26,844 --> 00:06:28,513
AND A WHOLE SANDWICH FOR ME.

178
00:06:28,513 --> 00:06:30,222
- AH. 
- HELLO. HEY.

179
00:06:30,222 --> 00:06:32,266
SO WHAT'S GOING ON 
WITH THE FUND-RAISER?

180
00:06:32,266 --> 00:06:34,477
- WELL, UH, I DON'T THINK 
THE HOME BUILDER'S ORGANIZATION

181
00:06:34,477 --> 00:06:36,270
IS GONNA BE SUPPORTING US.

182
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:37,730
- YEAH, THE H.B.O. 
IS NOT GONNA WANT US.

183
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:38,939
WHAT DO WE DO NOW?

184
00:06:38,939 --> 00:06:40,190
- WELL, I THINK IT'S SHOWTIME.

185
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:42,485
I THINK WE HAVE TO HAVE 
A SHOW DURING DINNER.

186
00:06:42,485 --> 00:06:44,862
HEY, WE COULD HAVE 
SOME CELEBRITIES IN.

187
00:06:44,862 --> 00:06:47,197
YOU KNOW, OSCAR WINNERS 
LIKE, UH, NICOLE KIDMAN.

188
00:06:47,197 --> 00:06:49,324
- I DON'T WANNA ROUND UP 
A BUNCH OF FAMOUS PEOPLE

189
00:06:49,324 --> 00:06:50,409
THAT HAVE NOTHING TO DO 
WITH OUR FAMILY

190
00:06:50,409 --> 00:06:51,577
AS SOME SORT OF CHEAP STUNT.

191
00:06:51,577 --> 00:06:52,578
I MEAN, WHAT'S THAT GOT TO DO 
WITH US?

192
00:06:52,578 --> 00:06:54,872
- NOTHING, BUT YOU'RE GONNA 
WRITE A SPEECH ABOUT ME...

193
00:06:54,872 --> 00:06:56,874
SO THEY CAN SEE 
HOW WONDERFUL I AM.

194
00:06:56,874 --> 00:06:58,959
- I THINK WE GOT A BETTER 
CHANCE AT NICOLE KIDMAN.

195
00:06:58,959 --> 00:07:00,210
- OH? HUH?

196
00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:01,712
- ACTUALLY, I MAY HAVE 
AN IN WITH ANDY RICHTER.

197
00:07:01,712 --> 00:07:03,047
- WELL, DO YOU THINK 
YOU CAN GET HIM?

198
00:07:03,047 --> 00:07:05,049
I'M KIDDING. 
OF COURSE NOT HIM.

199
00:07:05,049 --> 00:07:08,093
- HIS BROTHER DOES TEACH 
GEORGE MICHAEL AT OPENINGS.

200
00:07:08,093 --> 00:07:11,681
- GEORGE MICHAEL IS GOING TO 
THAT NEW AGE FEEL-GOODERIE?

201
00:07:11,681 --> 00:07:12,973
I DON'T THINK THAT'S 
A GOOD IDEA.

202
00:07:12,973 --> 00:07:14,559
THEY'RE GONNA 
POISON HIM AGAINST YOU.

203
00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:15,810
REMEMBER WHAT HAPPENED

204
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:17,061
WHEN WE SENT LINDSAY 
TO THAT KIND OF SCHOOL?

205
00:07:17,061 --> 00:07:19,980
ALL OF A SUDDEN I WAS 
THE BAD GUY TO HER.

206
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:24,902
- AND YOU DON'T RESPECT MOM, 
AND YOU DON'T RESPECT WOMEN.

207
00:07:24,902 --> 00:07:27,822
- ARE YOU MARRIED? 
- DAMN SCHOOL.

208
00:07:27,822 --> 00:07:29,073
I SAID TO THE TEACHER--

209
00:07:29,073 --> 00:07:31,576
I SAID, "YOU POISON HER, 
I'LL POISON YOU."

210
00:07:31,576 --> 00:07:33,994
narrator: GEORGE SR. DID MORE 
THAN JUST SAY IT.

211
00:07:33,994 --> 00:07:36,997
HE SENT THE MAN A BASKET 
OF POISON MUFFINS.

212
00:07:36,997 --> 00:07:41,001
- DO YOU KNOW THE MUFFIN MAN? 
THERE'S A REWARD IF YOU DO.

213
00:07:41,001 --> 00:07:43,003
THEN, WOULD YOU LIKE SOME FOAM 
IN YOUR COFFEE?

214
00:07:43,003 --> 00:07:47,424
IT'S CALLED A "CUPPUCCINO," AND 
WAIT TILL YOU SEE WHAT IT COSTS.

215
00:07:47,424 --> 00:07:50,344
- YOU CAN SAY WHAT YOU WANT 
ABOUT THE MILFORD ACADEMY.

216
00:07:50,344 --> 00:07:54,139
THE KIDS WHO CAME OUT OF THERE, 
PREPARED FOR LIFE.

217
00:07:54,139 --> 00:07:56,016
- DOES ANYONE KNOW HOW 
TO EAT ONE OF THESE?

218
00:07:56,016 --> 00:07:58,018
- YOU KNOW, GEORGE MICHAEL'S 
GONNA BE FINE, OKAY?

219
00:07:58,018 --> 00:07:59,812
I JUST WANT HIM TO KNOW 
HOW TO EXPRESS HIMSELF.

220
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:01,021
- THAT DOESN'T DO ANYTHING.

221
00:08:01,021 --> 00:08:03,983
narrator: HE WAS ACTUALLY HAVING 
TROUBLE EXPRESSING HIMSELF.

222
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:05,943
- WHY DON'T YOU TELL THE GROUP 
ABOUT YOURSELF?

223
00:08:05,943 --> 00:08:08,571
- MY NAME IS 
GEORGE MICHAEL BLUTH.

224
00:08:08,571 --> 00:08:11,073
I AM A 16-YEAR-OLD 
CAUCASIAN MALE.

225
00:08:11,073 --> 00:08:13,576
MY MOM DIED.

226
00:08:13,576 --> 00:08:16,411
AND I-I GUESS 
THAT'S IT.

227
00:08:16,411 --> 00:08:19,039
- HARDLY. SEE, IF IT WERE ME, 
I WOULD SAY,

228
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:20,290
"I'M DONNIE RICHTER.

229
00:08:20,290 --> 00:08:23,335
"I HAVE A BROTHER NAMED ANDY. 
HE'S AN ATTENTION HOG.

230
00:08:23,335 --> 00:08:25,212
"HE CAN'T SEEM TO REALLY ATTRACT 
A REAL AUDIENCE,

231
00:08:25,212 --> 00:08:28,048
"BUT I LOVE 
THE FAT S.O.B. ANYWAY."

232
00:08:28,048 --> 00:08:29,634
- I THOUGHT YOU LOOKED LIKE 
THAT GUY ANDY RICHTER.

233
00:08:29,634 --> 00:08:30,968
YOU GUYS 
ARE IDENTICAL TWINS?

234
00:08:30,968 --> 00:08:33,012
- IDENTICAL QUINTUPLETS, 
ACTUALLY.

235
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:34,555
narrator: 
THERE WAS ANDY THE SHOW-OFF,

236
00:08:34,555 --> 00:08:36,306
DONNIE THE SENSITIVE ONE,

237
00:08:36,306 --> 00:08:38,934
CHARETH THE FLIRT, 
ROCKY THE RISK-TAKER

238
00:08:38,934 --> 00:08:40,645
AND ANDY'S STUNT DOUBLE,

239
00:08:40,645 --> 00:08:43,898
AND EMMETT WHO ASKED THAT 
WE NOT SHOW HIS PICTURE,

240
00:08:43,898 --> 00:08:45,190
ALTHOUGH COMPOSITE PHOTOGRAPHY

241
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:47,693
TELLS US HE'D LOOK SOMETHING 
LIKE THIS.

242
00:08:47,693 --> 00:08:48,944
- HERE'S WHAT 
I WANT YOU TO DO.

243
00:08:48,944 --> 00:08:50,195
I WANT YOU 
TO GO HOME TONIGHT...

244
00:08:50,195 --> 00:08:52,907
AND WRITE SOMETHING ABOUT 
HOW YOU REALLY FEEL.

245
00:08:52,907 --> 00:08:54,158
SOMETHING CRITICAL.

246
00:08:54,158 --> 00:08:56,076
BRING IT IN TOMORROW 
AND READ IT FOR THE GROUP.

247
00:08:56,076 --> 00:08:57,369
- UM, WILL THIS GO TOWARD 
MY GRADE?

248
00:08:57,369 --> 00:09:00,205
- OH, WE DON'T HAVE GRADES HERE.

249
00:09:00,205 --> 00:09:01,791
A STUDENT EITHER LEARNS 
AND GETS AN "L,"

250
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:05,127
OR THEY 
FLUCTUATE IN THEIR LEARNING.

251
00:09:05,127 --> 00:09:06,295
- AND WHAT DO WE GET 
FOR THAT?

252
00:09:06,295 --> 00:09:07,337
- AN "F."

253
00:09:07,337 --> 00:09:08,463
- [singing] 
MR. F.

254
00:09:08,463 --> 00:09:09,549
narrator: 
MAEBY, MEANWHILE,

255
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:10,925
WAS ABOUT TO HAVE A LEARNING 
EXPERIENCE OF HER OWN.

256
00:09:10,925 --> 00:09:11,967
- WELL, WELL, WELL.

257
00:09:11,967 --> 00:09:14,053
I UNDERSTAND YOU'VE BEEN 
HAVING TROUBLE WITH THAT

258
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:15,638
EXPENSIVE BOARDING SCHOOL.

259
00:09:15,638 --> 00:09:17,682
THAT'S RIGHT. 
I CAN READ.

260
00:09:17,682 --> 00:09:19,850
- OKAY, FIRST OF ALL, VARIETY 
GOT IT WRONG, ALL RIGHT?

261
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:22,102
WE DIDN'T WANT THIS PROJECT. 
IT WAS A COFINANCE WITH MIRAMAX.

262
00:09:22,102 --> 00:09:24,313
AND POOF, MIRAMAX IS GONE. 
WE'RE STILL ON THE HOOK.

263
00:09:24,313 --> 00:09:26,273
IT TURNS OUT JAMIE KENNEDY 
CAN'T EVEN SNOWBOARD.

264
00:09:26,273 --> 00:09:27,524
[disco music]

265
00:09:27,524 --> 00:09:29,610
- [sighs] ALL RIGHT, 
I'LL LISTEN TO THIS LATER.

266
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:30,903
DON'T TELL ME WHERE YOU'VE 
BEEN.

267
00:09:30,903 --> 00:09:34,114
IT'LL JUST MAKE ME 
WORRY MORE. BUT GUESS WHAT.

268
00:09:34,114 --> 00:09:35,365
THERE'S A NEW DADDY IN TOWN.

269
00:09:35,365 --> 00:09:37,117
- [singing] 
THERE'S A NEW DADDY IN TOWN

270
00:09:37,117 --> 00:09:38,368
- A DISCIPLINE DADDY.

271
00:09:38,368 --> 00:09:41,205
- [singing] HE'S A DISCIPLINE 
DADDY GONNA SPANK HIS BEHIND

272
00:09:41,205 --> 00:09:42,665
- OH, IT'S, UH-- 
IT'S A PARENTING TAPE.

273
00:09:42,665 --> 00:09:43,666
[music stops]

274
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:44,917
IF YOU WANNA SKIP SCHOOL, 
THAT'S FINE.

275
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:46,669
YOU'LL JUST 
COME TO WORK WITH ME.

276
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:48,671
- BUT YOU DON'T HAVE A JOB.

277
00:09:48,671 --> 00:09:51,048
- ALL RIGHT. HERE. 
TELL YOU WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO.

278
00:09:51,048 --> 00:09:54,885
WE ARE GOING TO STUFF EACH ONE 
OF THESE GIFT BAGS WITH...

279
00:09:54,885 --> 00:09:59,849
A HEAD SHOT, SOME GLITTER 
AND A DECORATIVE HAND SOAP.

280
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:02,476
AND WE'RE GONNA SEND 'EM TO 
EVERY CASTING DIRECTOR IN TOWN.

281
00:10:02,476 --> 00:10:03,811
AND DON'T FORGET 
THE FUNNY NOTES.

282
00:10:03,811 --> 00:10:06,480
- "I KNOW WHERE YOU LIVE. 
HA, HA"?

283
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,940
CASTING DIRECTORS HATE THIS.

284
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:09,859
narrator: 
THEY REALLY DO.

285
00:10:09,859 --> 00:10:11,902
- [sighs] THE GLITTER QUEEN 
STRUCK AGAIN.

286
00:10:11,902 --> 00:10:14,739
NEVER HIRE TOBIAS FUNKE.

287
00:10:14,739 --> 00:10:16,323
narrator: 
AND BACK AT THE COUNTRY CLUB,

288
00:10:16,323 --> 00:10:18,117
SOMETHING UNUSUAL HAD HAPPENED.

289
00:10:18,117 --> 00:10:19,493
- OH, I DON'T HAVE ANY DRUGS 
FOR SALE.

290
00:10:19,493 --> 00:10:22,830
UNLESS, DID YOU EXPECT 
ME TO FOLLOW YOU TO YOUR CAR?

291
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:24,957
- THEY'RE YOUR TIPS. 
- TIPS.

292
00:10:24,957 --> 00:10:26,792
narrator: AND GOB 
REALIZED HE'D ACCIDENTALLY

293
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:30,462
WORKED A DAY IN HIS LIFE.

294
00:10:30,462 --> 00:10:32,506
LINDSAY, MEANWHILE, 
WAS BEING A MOTHER,

295
00:10:32,506 --> 00:10:34,049
WHEN SOMEONE SHOWED UP 
WHO NEEDED ONE.

296
00:10:34,049 --> 00:10:35,050
- HEY.

297
00:10:35,050 --> 00:10:36,927
- HOW'D YOU GET HERE? 
- I WALKED.

298
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:39,764
I TRIED HITCHHIKING, BUT IT'S 
HARD TO DO WITHOUT A THUMB.

299
00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:41,015
I'M SO HUNGRY.

300
00:10:41,015 --> 00:10:43,934
- WOULD YOU LIKE TO TRY 
SOME OF THIS?

301
00:10:43,934 --> 00:10:46,395
- MMM.

302
00:10:46,395 --> 00:10:50,274
SO WATERY, AND YET THERE'S 
A SMACK OF HAM TO IT.

303
00:10:50,274 --> 00:10:52,567
- IT'S HOT HAM WATER.

304
00:10:52,567 --> 00:10:53,568
- YEAH.

305
00:10:53,568 --> 00:10:54,569
narrator: 
UPSTAIRS, GEORGE MICHAEL

306
00:10:54,569 --> 00:10:56,030
WAS STRUGGLING WITH HIS 
ASSIGNMENT.

307
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:58,157
- CAN YOU THINK OF ANYTHING 
CRITICAL TO SAY ABOUT MY DAD?

308
00:10:58,157 --> 00:11:00,034
- ARE YOU SERIOUS?

309
00:11:00,034 --> 00:11:01,285
- I HAVE GLITTER IN MY LUNGS

310
00:11:01,285 --> 00:11:03,495
FROM MAKING GOODY BAGS 
FOR CASTING DIRECTORS.

311
00:11:03,495 --> 00:11:05,580
AND HE'S GIVEN ME A HUNDRED MORE 
TO DO FOR HOMEWORK.

312
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:06,999
IT'S, LIKE, "I DON'T 
DO MY HOMEWORK.

313
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:09,209
"GEORGE MICHAEL 
DOES MY HOMEWORK."

314
00:11:09,209 --> 00:11:10,795
narrator: 
AND THAT'S WHEN HE DECIDED IT

315
00:11:10,795 --> 00:11:12,212
WAS TIME TO CHEAT OFF OF HER.

316
00:11:12,212 --> 00:11:14,214
- YOU KNOW, IT MIGHT HELP IF 
YOU EXPRESSED YOURSELF.

317
00:11:14,214 --> 00:11:15,465
narrator: 
IT ALSO GAVE HIM AN

318
00:11:15,465 --> 00:11:19,261
OPPORTUNITY 
TO SMELL HER NECK.

319
00:11:19,261 --> 00:11:21,263
AND THE NEXT DAY, 
MICHAEL DROVE TO OPENINGS

320
00:11:21,263 --> 00:11:23,015
IN THE HOPES OF RECRUITING 
DONNIE'S BROTHER

321
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:24,433
FOR THE FUND-RAISER,

322
00:11:24,433 --> 00:11:28,062
WHEN HE NOTICED HIS SON 
EXPRESSING HIMSELF RATHER WELL.

323
00:11:28,062 --> 00:11:29,939
- HE PRETENDS HE'S THE GREAT 
FATHER ALL OF A SUDDEN

324
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:32,232
AND ACTS LIKE HE'S ALL WORRIED 
ABOUT ME.

325
00:11:32,232 --> 00:11:33,483
BUT IT TURNS OUT HE

326
00:11:33,483 --> 00:11:36,070
JUST DOES IT SO I CAN HELP HIM 
WITH HIS JOKE OF A CAREER.

327
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:38,238
NO WONDER MOM 
WANTED OUT SO BAD.

328
00:11:38,238 --> 00:11:41,283
- OH, MY GOD. 
- OH, MY GOD.

329
00:11:41,283 --> 00:11:42,534
narrator: GOB, MEANWHILE,

330
00:11:42,534 --> 00:11:45,913
WAS SEVERAL DAYS IN TO BEING 
AN ACCIDENTAL WAITER.

331
00:11:45,913 --> 00:11:47,497
AND HE DISCOVERED 
THAT A LITTLE FLIRTING

332
00:11:47,497 --> 00:11:49,249
HELPED BRING IN THE TIPS.

333
00:11:49,249 --> 00:11:50,918
- IF YOU DIDN'T HAVE 
ADULT-ONSET DIABETES,

334
00:11:50,918 --> 00:11:53,087
I WOULDN'T MIND 
GIVING YOU A LITTLE SUGAR.

335
00:11:53,087 --> 00:11:58,217
- OH, GOB. YOU COULD CHARM 
THE BLACK OFF A TELEGRAM BOY.

336
00:11:58,217 --> 00:11:59,844
narrator: OKAY, 
WE'LL JUST TELL YOU NOW.

337
00:11:59,844 --> 00:12:01,053
SHE'S THE ONE WHO DIES.

338
00:12:01,053 --> 00:12:03,848
- HIS NAME IS ANDY SOMETHING.

339
00:12:03,848 --> 00:12:05,099
I THINK HE'S 
ED MCMAHON'S KID.

340
00:12:05,099 --> 00:12:07,226
A SONG AND DANCE MAN.

341
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:08,518
narrator: 
LUCILLE, MEANWHILE,

342
00:12:08,518 --> 00:12:10,896
WAS THERE 
SOLICITING FOR THE FUND-RAISER,

343
00:12:10,896 --> 00:12:12,147
BUT STILL HADN'T NOTICED HIM.

344
00:12:12,147 --> 00:12:13,774
- [snapping] 
WE'LL HAVE THE LOBSTER TAIL.

345
00:12:13,774 --> 00:12:15,067
narrator: 
UNTIL THIS HAPPENED.

346
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:16,276
- AND MAYBE LATER YOU CAN...

347
00:12:16,276 --> 00:12:19,571
SAVE A LITTLE 
PIECE OF TAIL FOR ME.

348
00:12:19,571 --> 00:12:21,531
COME ON! 
- [screams]

349
00:12:21,531 --> 00:12:23,658
- I HOPE THAT ISN'T THE SORT 
OF HUMOR

350
00:12:23,658 --> 00:12:25,619
ANDY MCMAHON 
WILL BE DOING.

351
00:12:25,619 --> 00:12:27,037
- LOBSTER, MOM?

352
00:12:27,037 --> 00:12:29,331
narrator: AND MICHAEL 
WENT TO CONFRONT DONNIE.

353
00:12:29,331 --> 00:12:30,332
- HEY!

354
00:12:30,332 --> 00:12:33,377
NICE HAIRCUT AND THANKS 
FOR TURNING MY SON AGAINST ME.

355
00:12:33,377 --> 00:12:35,629
- OH, OH. NO, NO. 
I-I'M ANDY.

356
00:12:35,629 --> 00:12:37,672
- OH. SORRY.

357
00:12:37,672 --> 00:12:38,757
OH, HEY.

358
00:12:38,757 --> 00:12:40,843
HOW WOULD YOU FEEL ABOUT COMING 
TO A FUND-RAISER AT OUR HOUSE?

359
00:12:40,843 --> 00:12:42,094
HOW MUCH DOES IT PAY?

360
00:12:42,094 --> 00:12:43,637
- IT'S JUST A FREE DINNER, 
BUT--

361
00:12:43,637 --> 00:12:45,680
- I'LL BE THERE. 
- GREAT.

362
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:49,101
- I'LL BE IN THE CAFETERIA. 
- OH, HE'S SUCH A PIG.

363
00:12:49,101 --> 00:12:51,478
- YOU SHOULD KNOW ABOUT 
BAD-MOUTHING FAMILY MEMBERS.

364
00:12:51,478 --> 00:12:53,522
I HEARD WHAT YOU HAD 
MY SON SAY OUT THERE.

365
00:12:53,522 --> 00:12:55,565
- HE CHOSE WHAT TO SAY.

366
00:12:55,565 --> 00:12:56,984
MAYBE WE SHOULD 
INCLUDE HIM IN THIS.

367
00:12:56,984 --> 00:12:58,402
- NO NEED.

368
00:12:58,402 --> 00:13:00,154
YOU'RE THE ONE THAT POISONED 
HIM AGAINST ME.

369
00:13:00,154 --> 00:13:01,780
HOW WOULD 
YOU LIKE THAT DONE TO YOU?

370
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:04,324
- ARE YOU THREATENING 
TO POISON ME?

371
00:13:04,324 --> 00:13:08,120
- I'M JUST EXPRESSING MYSELF, 
MAN.

372
00:13:09,914 --> 00:13:13,625
- WHAT DID I TELL YOU? 
- HOW DARE THAT DONNIE RICHTER.

373
00:13:13,625 --> 00:13:16,253
- YEAH, YOU GOTTA TAKE CARE 
OF THAT GUY, OR I WILL.

374
00:13:16,253 --> 00:13:18,881
- YEAH, YEAH. LET ME. 
- THIS IS NOT YOUR BUSINESS. NO.

375
00:13:18,881 --> 00:13:20,883
I'M JUST GONNA PULL HIM 
OUT OF THAT SCHOOL.

376
00:13:20,883 --> 00:13:22,134
- YOU'RE DAMN RIGHT, YOU ARE.

377
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:23,928
WE CAN'T HAVE THIS HAPPEN. 
NOT NOW.

378
00:13:23,928 --> 00:13:26,889
THIS FAMILY HAS GOT 
TO STICK TOGETHER.

379
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:28,891
- I DON'T WANT GOB 
COMING TO THIS DINNER.

380
00:13:28,891 --> 00:13:30,142
- GOOD IDEA.

381
00:13:30,142 --> 00:13:31,518
- GUESS WHERE HE'S BEEN 
GETTING HIS MONEY.

382
00:13:31,518 --> 00:13:33,562
- IS HE FOLLOWING PEOPLE 
TO THEIR CARS AGAIN?

383
00:13:33,562 --> 00:13:36,065
- HE'S A WAITER! 
- [gasps]

384
00:13:36,065 --> 00:13:38,442
- HE IS? WELL, THAT'S GREAT. 
- NO, IT'S NOT GREAT.

385
00:13:38,442 --> 00:13:40,777
- AM I THE ONLY ONE THAT 
THINKS THIS FAMILY

386
00:13:40,777 --> 00:13:42,863
HAS FINALLY STARTING TO BECOME 
SYMPATHETIC AND RELATABLE?

387
00:13:42,863 --> 00:13:44,448
THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE WANNA SEE, 
YOU KNOW.

388
00:13:44,448 --> 00:13:45,824
LINDSAY'S TAKING CARE 
OF THE HOUSE.

389
00:13:45,824 --> 00:13:48,202
- OH, I FORGOT ABOUT THAT.

390
00:13:48,202 --> 00:13:51,288
TELL THE "HOUSEWIFE" 
SHE'S NOT COMING EITHER.

391
00:13:51,288 --> 00:13:53,123
- IF YOU DON'T WANT HER, 
YOU DON'T WANT ME EITHER.

392
00:13:53,123 --> 00:13:54,583
SHE'S TAKING CARE OF ME.

393
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:57,502
SHE GLUED MY THUMB BACK ON.

394
00:13:57,502 --> 00:13:58,795
SISTER'S MY NEW MOTHER, 
MOTHER.

395
00:13:58,795 --> 00:14:00,965
AND IS IT JUST ME, 
OR IS SHE LOOKING HOTTER TOO?

396
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:03,425
- WHY DON'T YOU MARRY HER? 
- MAYBE I WILL!

397
00:14:03,425 --> 00:14:05,469
- WE'RE VEERING AWAY 
FROM RELATABILITY AGAIN.

398
00:14:05,469 --> 00:14:07,304
narrator: MEANWHILE, 
MAEBY WAS GETTING TIRED

399
00:14:07,304 --> 00:14:08,513
OF BEING WITH HER FATHER.

400
00:14:08,513 --> 00:14:11,308
- NOW WHAT WE DO IS WE PAINT OUR 
LIPS JOAN CRAWFORD RED,

401
00:14:11,308 --> 00:14:12,559
POP ON A LITTLE BLUE EYELINER

402
00:14:12,559 --> 00:14:15,395
AND THEN PLANT A LIPSTICK KISS 
ON EVERY ONE OF 'EM.

403
00:14:15,395 --> 00:14:16,646
- WHY THE BLUE EYELINER?

404
00:14:16,646 --> 00:14:19,274
- WELL, SHE FELT THAT HER EYES 
WERE TOO CLOSE TOGETHER.

405
00:14:19,274 --> 00:14:22,027
HELLO? 
UH, YEAH, UH--

406
00:14:22,027 --> 00:14:25,572
IT'S A CASTING DIRECTOR. 
YES, HE IS AVAILABLE.

407
00:14:25,572 --> 00:14:26,823
UH, LET ME PUT MY, UH--

408
00:14:26,823 --> 00:14:29,784
OUR, UH, ASSISTANT 
ON THE PHONE WITH YOU.

409
00:14:29,784 --> 00:14:33,330
THANK YOU, YES. 
I BETTER GET CHANGED.

410
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:35,332
- THANKS, DEB. 
YEAH.

411
00:14:35,332 --> 00:14:37,667
SO, HE'S TORTURE VICTIM 
NUMBER FOUR, RIGHT?

412
00:14:37,667 --> 00:14:38,919
NO, THAT'S GREAT.

413
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:40,295
YEAH, HE'S REALLY 
INTO DISCIPLINE.

414
00:14:40,295 --> 00:14:41,881
narrator: 
AND GEORGE MICHAEL WAS ABOUT

415
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:42,965
TO GET SOME DISCIPLINE TOO.

416
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:45,009
- YOU ARE NO LONGER 
GOING TO THAT SCHOOL.

417
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:46,260
I DON'T WANNA GET INTO

418
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:48,345
A BIG DISCUSSION ABOUT IT. 
IT'S JUST NOT RIGHT FOR YOU.

419
00:14:48,345 --> 00:14:49,763
- IS THIS BECAUSE I CHEATED 
OFF MAEBY?

420
00:14:49,763 --> 00:14:51,348
I'VE NEVER DONE 
THAT BEFORE, DAD. I SWEAR.

421
00:14:51,348 --> 00:14:52,933
I JUST COULDN'T THINK OF 
ANYTHING TO WRITE ABOUT YOU,

422
00:14:52,933 --> 00:14:54,476
SO I ASKED HER 
TO WRITE IT ABOUT HER DAD.

423
00:14:54,476 --> 00:14:55,727
- YOU CHEATED?

424
00:14:55,727 --> 00:14:57,938
- YEAH, IT WAS 
STUPID OF ME.

425
00:14:57,938 --> 00:14:59,189
NOW DONNIE'S MET YOU.

426
00:14:59,189 --> 00:15:00,440
I MEAN HE'S NEVER GONNA BELIEVE

427
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:02,234
THAT YOU WERE UP 
FOR A PART IN WICKED.

428
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:03,485
- YOU DO WHAT YOU HAVE TO.

429
00:15:03,485 --> 00:15:05,195
I MEAN, DO YOU THINK I WANT TO 
GIVE THAT SPEECH ABOUT DAD

430
00:15:05,195 --> 00:15:06,321
AT THE FUND-RAISER?

431
00:15:06,321 --> 00:15:08,407
SOMETIMES YOU SAY YOU HATE 
YOUR DAD TO GET A GOOD GRADE

432
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:10,742
OR YOU LIKE HIM 
TO MAKE SOME MONEY.

433
00:15:10,742 --> 00:15:12,452
SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE DOING 
A GREAT JOB OVER THERE.

434
00:15:12,452 --> 00:15:14,121
WE'RE KEEPING YOU IN. 
- NO--

435
00:15:14,121 --> 00:15:15,915
- I SAID I DON'T WANNA HAVE 
A WHOLE DISCUSSION ABOUT IT.

436
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:20,377
DONNIE. WELL, I GUESS 
I OWE YOU AN APOLOGY.

437
00:15:20,377 --> 00:15:21,628
- NO.

438
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:24,631
- IT'S ANDY AGAIN, 
ISN'T IT?

439
00:15:24,631 --> 00:15:26,675
- ROCKY. 
ANDY'S THE PIG.

440
00:15:26,675 --> 00:15:29,386
- WELL, YOU'RE NOT EXACTLY-- 
- I'M HIS STUNT DOUBLE.

441
00:15:29,386 --> 00:15:31,888
YOU THINK I LIKE THIS? 
I DISGUST MYSELF.

442
00:15:31,888 --> 00:15:33,682
- LET GO OF MY DAD. 
YOU'RE GONNA HURT HIM.

443
00:15:33,682 --> 00:15:35,309
- OH, NO. I'M ONLY MAKING IT 
LOOK LIKE THAT.

444
00:15:35,309 --> 00:15:38,979
HE'S TOTALLY 
IN CHARGE OF THE SITUATION.

445
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:44,401
- SO WHAT IS THE PROBLEM?

446
00:15:44,401 --> 00:15:45,694
- SOMEBODY SENT MY 
BROTHER DONNIE

447
00:15:45,694 --> 00:15:48,613
A BASKET OF POISON MUFFINS.

448
00:15:48,613 --> 00:15:49,906
- OH, NO. 
IT COULD'VE BEEN THE MUFFIN MAN.

449
00:15:49,906 --> 00:15:51,075
THEY NEVER CAUGHT HIM.

450
00:15:51,075 --> 00:15:52,076
- HOW DO YOU KNOW ABOUT THAT?

451
00:15:52,076 --> 00:15:54,744
- I SAW IT ON "WHY WE 
WERE SCARED OF THE '70s."

452
00:15:54,744 --> 00:15:56,330
- AND WHAT EVER HAPPENED TO THE 
MUFFIN MAN?

453
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:57,497
REMEMBER HIM?

454
00:15:57,497 --> 00:16:00,417
I ALWAYS PICTURED 
A GIANT SIX-FOOT MUFFIN...

455
00:16:00,417 --> 00:16:02,419
TRYING TO EAT ME 
WHILE I WAS EATIN' HIM.

456
00:16:02,419 --> 00:16:04,838
IT'S KIND OF A FANTASY 
I GO TO A LOT NOW.

457
00:16:04,838 --> 00:16:07,882
- AND HE SAYS YOU THREATENED 
TO POISON HIM.

458
00:16:07,882 --> 00:16:09,843
- I WAS UPSET.

459
00:16:09,843 --> 00:16:12,096
I'D JUST HEARD THAT MY SON 
THOUGHT I WAS A HORRIBLE FATHER.

460
00:16:12,096 --> 00:16:13,513
BUT, NO, I DIDN'T POISON HIM.

461
00:16:13,513 --> 00:16:16,891
- WELL, IF I FIND OUT YOU DID--

462
00:16:16,891 --> 00:16:19,436
OH, UH, ANDY WANTS TO KNOW, 
AT THIS DINNER,

463
00:16:19,436 --> 00:16:20,729
YOU WANT HIM TO SING 
OR ANYTHING?

464
00:16:20,729 --> 00:16:23,815
- A SONG WOULD BE FANTASTIC.

465
00:16:23,815 --> 00:16:25,067
- SO DAD, YOU SAW THAT?

466
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:27,402
I THOUGHT YOU DIDN'T KNOW 
WHAT I SAID ABOUT YOU.

467
00:16:27,402 --> 00:16:29,446
- WELL, THAT WASN'T 
EXACTLY THE TRUTH.

468
00:16:29,446 --> 00:16:30,697
BUT DON'T WORRY.

469
00:16:30,697 --> 00:16:31,991
I KNOW YOU DON'T HAVE ANYTHING 
BAD TO SAY ABOUT ME.

470
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:33,700
- NO. YOU KNOW WHAT? 
I THINK DONNIE WAS RIGHT.

471
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:35,494
I JUST WASN'T 
DIGGING DEEP ENOUGH.

472
00:16:35,494 --> 00:16:36,911
YOU KNOW I THINK I MIGHT'VE 
MEANT WHAT I SAID.

473
00:16:36,911 --> 00:16:38,163
YOU NEVER LISTEN TO ME.

474
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:40,040
YOU DIDN'T ASK ME IF I WANTED 
TO GO TO THIS SCHOOL.

475
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41,458
YOU DIDN'T 
ASK ME ABOUT WHAT I SAID.

476
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:44,669
YOU THREATENED MY TEACHER. 
YOU DON'T RESPECT ME.

477
00:16:44,669 --> 00:16:47,006
HOW CAN I RESPECT YOU, MAN?

478
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:49,466
narrator: 
IT WAS A COMPLEX SITUATION...

479
00:16:49,466 --> 00:16:51,468
WITHOUT AN EASY SOLUTION. 
[phone rings]

480
00:16:51,468 --> 00:16:52,927
- HELLO? 
- THE CATERERS DIDN'T SHOW UP.

481
00:16:52,927 --> 00:16:54,846
I USED THE CLUB.

482
00:16:54,846 --> 00:16:56,265
THEY SAID WE OWE THEM 
TOO MUCH MONEY.

483
00:16:56,265 --> 00:16:57,849
I GUESS ALL THOSE LUNCHES.

484
00:16:57,849 --> 00:16:59,434
I'VE GOT 50 PEOPLE COMING 
IN THREE HOURS

485
00:16:59,434 --> 00:17:03,480
AND NOTHING TO FEED THEM, 
NO ONE TO SERVE IT.

486
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:07,109
WE HAVE TO MAKE A GOOD 
IMPRESSION, OR WE'RE FINISHED.

487
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:08,860
narrator: 
NOW THAT'S A CLEAR-CUT SITUATION

488
00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:10,195
WITH THE PROMISE OF COMEDY.

489
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:11,530
TELL YOUR FRIENDS.

00:17:17,911 --> 00:17:20,455
WAS STARTING TO HEAT UP.

492
00:17:26,253 --> 00:17:29,756
BUT THE SAME COULD NOT BE SAID 
FOR LINDSAY'S CHICKEN.

493
00:17:29,756 --> 00:17:31,758
- WHAT IS GOING ON? 
THEY'RE GETTING RESTLESS.

494
00:17:31,758 --> 00:17:33,802
I CAN'T OFFER TO-- [bleep] THEM 
IN FRONT OF THEIR HUSBANDS.

495
00:17:33,802 --> 00:17:36,096
- THIS IS WHAT YOU'RE MAKING? 
POACHED SALMONELLA?

496
00:17:36,096 --> 00:17:38,598
- IT'LL BE FINE. I'LL JUST 
PUT THE SAUCE ON THEM.

497
00:17:38,598 --> 00:17:40,642
- WHAT KIND OF SAUCE 
IS THAT?

498
00:17:40,642 --> 00:17:42,602
- WAIT. THIS IS THE WATER 
I THAWED THE CHICKEN IN.

499
00:17:42,602 --> 00:17:44,521
- OH. WELL, THAT SHOULD GO 
WITH CHICKEN.

500
00:17:44,521 --> 00:17:47,399
- YEAH. [laughs] 
- FANTASTIC.

501
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:49,484
narrator: AND SOME POWERFUL 
PLAYERS SHOWED UP.

502
00:17:49,484 --> 00:17:51,486
- GEORGE, BILL KINCADE 
FROM FOSTCO INDUSTRIES.

503
00:17:51,486 --> 00:17:52,737
narrator: SORT OF.

504
00:17:52,737 --> 00:17:53,988
- HOPE YOU DON'T MIND.

505
00:17:53,988 --> 00:17:55,240
I SENT ONE OF THOSE 
STUPID SURROGATES.

506
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,491
- YOU GOT BUSTED TOO?

507
00:17:56,491 --> 00:17:57,992
- NO, I HAD A PRIOR 
ENGAGEMENT.

508
00:17:57,992 --> 00:17:59,244
I'M AT THE FIRE AND ICE BALL.

509
00:17:59,244 --> 00:18:02,331
- COMING THROUGH. 
CHICKEN IN CHICKEN SAUCE.

510
00:18:02,331 --> 00:18:04,333
- THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
FOR SHOWING UP.

511
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:06,335
MAYBE YOU COULD SING WHILE 
THEY'RE BRINGING OUT DINNERS.

512
00:18:06,335 --> 00:18:10,297
- UH, I'M NOT ANDY. 
I'M EMMETT.

513
00:18:10,297 --> 00:18:11,548
ANDY SENT ME OVER

514
00:18:11,548 --> 00:18:13,383
TO LET YOU KNOW HE'S NOT 
GONNA MAKE IT TONIGHT.

515
00:18:13,383 --> 00:18:14,801
narrator: 
MICHAEL WAS SUSPICIOUS.

516
00:18:14,801 --> 00:18:16,303
I MEAN, THINK ABOUT IT.

517
00:18:16,303 --> 00:18:18,930
WE CAN'T SHOW EMMETT 
WITHOUT BLURRING HIM.

518
00:18:18,930 --> 00:18:22,726
- YEAH, HE'S SINGING AT THE FIRE 
AND ICE BALL TONIGHT.

519
00:18:22,726 --> 00:18:25,604
- ANDY RICHTER IS SINGING 
AT THE FIRE AND ICE BALL?

520
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:27,314
YOU KNOW, I SHOULD 
SEND ANDY A LITTLE BASKET

521
00:18:27,314 --> 00:18:30,317
OF POISON MUFFINS TOO.

522
00:18:30,317 --> 00:18:32,319
- MUFFINS? 
- [sighs]

523
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:35,322
- OH, MY GOD. DAD? 
YOU'RE THE MUFFIN MAN?

524
00:18:35,322 --> 00:18:38,325
YOU POISONED 25 TEACHERS 
DURING THE '70s?

525
00:18:38,325 --> 00:18:40,327
- JUST THE FIRST TWO. 
THE OTHERS WERE COPYCATS.

526
00:18:40,327 --> 00:18:41,620
- YOU POISONED DONNIE, 
DIDN'T YOU?

527
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:43,288
- WE'RE LOSING THEM. 
COME ON. COME ON.

528
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:44,539
[utensil hits glass]

529
00:18:44,539 --> 00:18:46,916
CAN I HAVE YOUR ATTENTION? 
MY SON WOULD LIKE TO SAY...

530
00:18:46,916 --> 00:18:49,253
JUST A COUPLE OF WORDS 
ABOUT ME.

531
00:18:49,253 --> 00:18:52,339
narrator: AND THAT'S WHEN 
MICHAEL NOTICED HIS OWN SON.

532
00:18:52,339 --> 00:18:53,590
- YOU CAME, HUH?

533
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:54,591
- YEAH, WELL, 
IT WAS WRONG OF ME

534
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:57,136
TO SAY WHAT I DID 
ABOUT HOW I FELT.

535
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:58,387
- NO, YOU SAID WHAT YOU FELT,

536
00:18:58,387 --> 00:19:00,680
AND MAYBE IT'S ABOUT TIME 
I DID THE SAME THING.

537
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:02,391
- SO WHY DON'T WE JUST LET HIM 
EXPRESS HIMSELF?

538
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:04,351
GO AHEAD, SON.

539
00:19:04,351 --> 00:19:08,688
- UM, I WAS GOING TO SAY 
THAT YOU DON'T KNOW WHO

540
00:19:08,688 --> 00:19:10,190
MY FATHER REALLY IS.

541
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:12,317
AND-AND-AND THAT 
WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO US

542
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:14,903
IS A GREAT INJUSTICE,

543
00:19:14,903 --> 00:19:16,821
THAT WE WERE NEVER REALLY 
GIVEN A FAIR CHANCE.

544
00:19:16,821 --> 00:19:19,824
BUT THAT'S NOT THE TRUTH.

545
00:19:19,824 --> 00:19:21,868
WE'VE BEEN GIVEN 
PLENTY OF CHANCES.

546
00:19:21,868 --> 00:19:24,788
AND MAYBE, THE BLUTHS 
JUST AREN'T WORTH SAVING.

547
00:19:24,788 --> 00:19:26,039
MAYBE WE'RE NOT 
THAT LIKABLE.

548
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:28,167
YOU KNOW? 
WE'RE VERY SELF-CENTERED.

549
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:30,835
AND MY FATHER MAY BE 
THE WORST OF US.

550
00:19:30,835 --> 00:19:33,004
ME TOO. YOU KNOW, 
I-I SEEM TO--

551
00:19:33,004 --> 00:19:34,839
I THREATEN PEOPLE WHO 
I DON'T FEEL SUPPORT ME.

552
00:19:34,839 --> 00:19:36,383
- [murmuring]

553
00:19:36,383 --> 00:19:40,387
HE POISONS THEM. ANYWAY, 
HERE'S MY ADVICE TO YOU.

554
00:19:40,387 --> 00:19:41,638
GO AND TAKE YOURSELF 
A GOODY BAG

555
00:19:41,638 --> 00:19:43,390
AND GET OUT OF HERE 
WHILE YOU CAN.

556
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:46,268
[chattering]

557
00:19:46,268 --> 00:19:49,145
narrator: THE SPEECH WAS 
DISTURBING, THE FOOD INEDIBLE,

558
00:19:49,145 --> 00:19:52,399
AND THE GIFT BAGS 
PRETTY FRIGHTENING.

559
00:19:52,399 --> 00:19:54,609
AND WHEN GOB REALIZED 
HE WOULDN'T GET TIPPED--

560
00:19:54,609 --> 00:19:56,778
- WAIT. NO. NO. 
WHERE'S EVERYONE GOING?

561
00:19:56,778 --> 00:19:58,405
narrator: THE SERVICE GOT 
A LITTLE WORSE.

562
00:19:58,405 --> 00:19:59,864
- NO ONE'S LEAVING 
UNTIL I GET MY MONEY!

563
00:19:59,864 --> 00:20:01,700
I'LL FOLLOW YOU TO YOUR CARS!

564
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:03,452
narrator: OH, AND THEN 
THAT OLD RACIST WOMAN

565
00:20:03,452 --> 00:20:05,537
CHOKED ON BUSTER'S THUMB.

566
00:20:05,537 --> 00:20:07,247
- MY THUMB! MY THUMB! 
- THIS LADY CAN'T BREATHE.

567
00:20:07,247 --> 00:20:08,332
narrator: ALL IN ALL,

568
00:20:08,332 --> 00:20:10,041
IT WAS ONE OF THE BLUTHS' 
BETTER DINNER PARTIES.

569
00:20:12,419 --> 00:20:13,878
- HEY, WHAT'D YOU THINK 
OF THE SPEECH?

570
00:20:13,878 --> 00:20:15,422
- YOU'D DO GREAT AT OPENINGS.

571
00:20:15,422 --> 00:20:19,259
- YOU KNOW, PAL, YOU DO NOT 
HAVE TO GO THERE.

572
00:20:19,259 --> 00:20:21,010
I'VE BEEN VERY WORRIED ABOUT 
YOUR BEHAVIOR.

573
00:20:21,010 --> 00:20:23,972
YOU'RE ALWAYS 
TURNING OFF BURNERS AND IRONS,

574
00:20:23,972 --> 00:20:28,142
AND IT MAY BE O.C.D.

575
00:20:28,142 --> 00:20:30,229
- O.C.D.? NO. I'M JUST 
CLEANING UP AFTER AUNT LINDSAY.

576
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:32,021
SHE NEVER TURNS THINGS OFF.

577
00:20:32,021 --> 00:20:33,982
- WOW. HMM.

578
00:20:33,982 --> 00:20:35,317
EXPLAINS WHY I SAW 
HEDGE TRIMMERS

579
00:20:35,317 --> 00:20:36,318
ZIPPIN' AROUND THE DRIVEWAY.

580
00:20:36,318 --> 00:20:38,445
I DID IT AGAIN, DIDN'T I? 
I'M SO SELF-CENTERED.

581
00:20:38,445 --> 00:20:39,696
FROM NOW ON,

582
00:20:39,696 --> 00:20:41,740
I WANT YOU TO JUST TELL ME 
WHAT'S ON YOUR MIND, OKAY?

583
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:42,991
AND I PROMISE, YOU KNOW,

584
00:20:42,991 --> 00:20:45,452
I WON'T JUST HEAR 
WHAT I WANNA HEAR, OKAY?

585
00:20:48,455 --> 00:20:51,958
- I LOVE MY COUSIN. 
- I LOVE YOU, TOO, PAL.

586
00:20:54,628 --> 00:20:56,713
narrator: ON THE NEXT 
ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT.

587
00:20:56,713 --> 00:20:59,674
THE BLUTH FAMILY 
GETS SOME GOOD NEWS.

588
00:20:59,674 --> 00:21:01,050
- THEY'RE ALL SENDING IN 
DONATIONS.

589
00:21:01,050 --> 00:21:03,177
AND YOU KNOW 
WHAT THE KEY WAS?

590
00:21:03,177 --> 00:21:04,429
- WHAT?

591
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:06,014
- YOUR SPEECH. 
IT DIDN'T SOUND DESPERATE.

592
00:21:06,014 --> 00:21:08,850
- WELL, I-I GUESS IT REALLY 
DOESN'T PAY TO BE DESPERATE.

593
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:11,645
- IT SURE DOESN'T.

594
00:21:11,645 --> 00:21:14,606
- AND CUT. 
[cheering]

595
00:21:14,606 --> 00:21:16,566
- GOOD JOB, MAN.

596
00:21:16,566 --> 00:21:17,817
- LET'S NOT CELEBRATE YET.

597
00:21:17,817 --> 00:21:19,278
WE'VE STILL GOT 
THE WEST COAST FEED, GUYS.
