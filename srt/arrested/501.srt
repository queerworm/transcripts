00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:13,430
All right!

2
00:00:13,513 --> 00:00:16,641
[Ron Howard] <i>Michael Bluth had been away</i>
<i>from his family for two months,</i>

3
00:00:16,725 --> 00:00:18,601
<i>and his life had never seemed better.</i>

4
00:00:18,685 --> 00:00:20,645
-[grunts]
-[man] Oh, head in the sand!

5
00:00:20,729 --> 00:00:24,691
[Ron] <i>While at a tech company famous</i>
<i>for providing access to any information,</i>

6
00:00:24,774 --> 00:00:26,151
<i>except for its own name,</i>

7
00:00:26,234 --> 00:00:28,737
<i>-he had found friends...</i>
-Jim.

8
00:00:29,362 --> 00:00:32,449
-Oh, nice return, Jim.
<i>-...been retrained for the workplace...</i>

9
00:00:32,532 --> 00:00:34,659
It's just <i>one </i>space after a period?

10
00:00:34,743 --> 00:00:36,036
That's okay. Let's try it again.

11
00:00:36,786 --> 00:00:39,205
<i>...and was learning new skills every day.</i>

12
00:00:39,289 --> 00:00:40,540
Hi, sorry I'm late.

13
00:00:40,623 --> 00:00:41,624
-[man] How you doing?
<i>-Konnichiwa.</i>

14
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:43,752
-So, is your family joining you?
-No.

15
00:00:43,835 --> 00:00:46,755
They will not be joining, um,
but, um, maybe just, uh,

16
00:00:46,838 --> 00:00:49,340
one of their kids can take a swing at me,
huh?

17
00:00:49,424 --> 00:00:53,303
[Ron] <i>While he believed</i>
<i>he had put his family behind him...</i>

18
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:57,557
This class is geared more to self-defense
<i>for </i>the family, not...

19
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:58,933
Not <i>from </i>the family.

20
00:00:59,017 --> 00:01:02,479
<i>-...there were some unresolved issues.</i>
-I get that.

21
00:01:03,271 --> 00:01:04,898
Do you have family-on-family stuff?

22
00:01:06,316 --> 00:01:08,443
A few years ago,
I would have given you the same look.

23
00:01:08,526 --> 00:01:12,072
[Ron] <i>In those few years,</i>
<i>Michael's life had changed quite a bit.</i>

24
00:01:12,155 --> 00:01:14,991
<i>After borrowing money</i>
<i>from a flirtatious family friend...</i>

25
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:17,494
-Just till I get on my feet.
<i>-...whose vertigo made it hard</i>

26
00:01:17,577 --> 00:01:19,788
<i>for her to stay on her </i>own <i>feet,</i>

27
00:01:19,871 --> 00:01:22,832
<i>Michael finally started</i>
<i>his own housing business.</i>

28
00:01:23,416 --> 00:01:26,711
{\an8}-The collapse of the housing market...
-[Ron] <i>At the worst possible time.</i>

29
00:01:26,795 --> 00:01:28,505
-That's not a great sign.
-[squawks]

30
00:01:28,588 --> 00:01:31,007
[Ron] <i>But Michael soon had</i>
<i>another business opportunity.</i>

31
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:33,968
-[Michael] I'm a producer?
-Well, it's a movie about the family.

32
00:01:34,052 --> 00:01:36,805
Although, the heartbeat of this thing
is the father-son dynamic.

33
00:01:36,888 --> 00:01:39,390
-[Ron] <i>Which put Michael off the project.</i>
-I'm not able to do this.

34
00:01:39,474 --> 00:01:42,060
[Ron] <i>Until a chance run-in</i>
<i>with actress Rebel Alley...</i>

35
00:01:42,143 --> 00:01:44,854
-I'm sorry.
-Where's a producer when you need one?

36
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:47,232
<i>-...put him back on it.</i>
-I'm a movie producer!

37
00:01:47,315 --> 00:01:49,317
[Ron] <i>And having found</i>
<i>his new leading lady...</i>

38
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,985
I could put your name in for something.

39
00:01:51,069 --> 00:01:53,238
<i>...who turned out to be</i>
<i>Ron Howard's daughter,</i>

40
00:01:53,571 --> 00:01:56,741
<i>Michael was soon acting</i>
<i>like a movie producer, too.</i>

41
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,410
[Ron] <i>Michael's son was starting</i>
<i>a business</i>

42
00:01:59,494 --> 00:02:02,914
<i>after claiming to have invented</i>
<i>a new privacy software.</i>

43
00:02:02,997 --> 00:02:05,625
...software that's also anti-piracy?
You have a way of doing this?

44
00:02:05,708 --> 00:02:06,584
This could be huge.

45
00:02:06,668 --> 00:02:09,295
[Ron] <i>Not exactly. It did do this.</i>

46
00:02:09,379 --> 00:02:11,214
...of what programmers
call "hacker traps."

47
00:02:11,297 --> 00:02:13,633
-It's called Fakeblock.
-[Ron] <i>And word spread.</i>

48
00:02:13,716 --> 00:02:15,093
How does your software work?

49
00:02:15,176 --> 00:02:18,346
[Ron] <i>Garnering attention</i>
<i>from the same actress to whom</i>

50
00:02:18,429 --> 00:02:20,014
<i>-he gave a fake name.</i>
-George Mi-- Harris.

51
00:02:20,098 --> 00:02:22,308
[Ron] <i>And soon,</i>
<i>George Michael was acting like a...</i>

52
00:02:22,392 --> 00:02:24,644
<i>well, a movie producer, too.</i>

53
00:02:26,354 --> 00:02:29,607
<i>She was raised by a different mother</i>
<i>than Ron's other kids.</i>

54
00:02:29,691 --> 00:02:31,651
<i>It's just a whole different thing</i>
<i>over there.</i>

55
00:02:31,734 --> 00:02:34,154
<i>Anyway, with Maeby</i>
<i>in charge of the business,</i>

56
00:02:34,237 --> 00:02:36,364
<i>George Michael soon found himself in debt.</i>

57
00:02:36,447 --> 00:02:37,991
Maeby, we can't afford this.

58
00:02:38,074 --> 00:02:39,784
And my software isn't even rea-- dy.

59
00:02:39,868 --> 00:02:43,288
-[Ron] <i>He found one place to save money.</i>
-Maeby, you're fired!

60
00:02:43,371 --> 00:02:45,498
[Ron] <i>And though Michael was losing Rebel</i>

61
00:02:45,582 --> 00:02:49,210
<i>-to her mystery man, he got good news.</i>
-You're dating Rebel Alley?

62
00:02:49,294 --> 00:02:51,254
Do you know the other guy
that she's dating?

63
00:02:51,337 --> 00:02:52,714
No. I know it's over.

64
00:02:52,797 --> 00:02:54,007
She is dumping him.

65
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:55,925
[Ron] <i>Which he promptly acted upon.</i>

66
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:57,385
[Michael singing]

67
00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:01,097
[Ron] <i>But it wouldn't be long</i>
<i>before Michael discovered</i> <i>who George...</i>

68
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:03,808
<i>-"Maharis" really was.</i>
-[bleeps]

69
00:03:03,892 --> 00:03:06,477
[Ron] <i>Something he kept to himself</i>
<i>when his son admitted...</i>

70
00:03:06,561 --> 00:03:07,979
-I think it might be over.
-Great.

71
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:11,858
Pain... fades slowly.

72
00:03:11,941 --> 00:03:14,611
-[Ron] <i>But Michael knew...</i>
-Quickly.

73
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:15,737
<i>...he'd have to end it.</i>

74
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:18,406
Tell me about your girlfriend.
You're producing this movie...

75
00:03:18,489 --> 00:03:20,825
I think they're both over.
Wasn't meant to be.

76
00:03:21,242 --> 00:03:23,995
You owe my sister $700,000.

77
00:03:24,078 --> 00:03:26,873
[Ron] <i>This, combined with a threat</i>
<i>from Lucille 2's brother...</i>

78
00:03:26,956 --> 00:03:31,169
-You can't hide in a gorilla suit from me.
-[Ron] <i>That one's hard to explain.</i>

79
00:03:31,252 --> 00:03:34,297
<i>...sent Michael to a night of drinking</i>
<i>and a desperate proposal</i>

80
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:37,217
<i>to get his $700,000 debt forgiven...</i>

81
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:39,677
I'm gonna have sex with you, for money.

82
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:42,472
<i>...that perhaps overestimated his value,</i>
<i>at least according</i>

83
00:03:42,555 --> 00:03:45,225
<i>to the latest</i>
<i>Balboa Bachelor Auction totals.</i>

84
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:51,522
<i>And returning from a night with Lucille 2,</i>

85
00:03:51,606 --> 00:03:54,901
<i>which ended poorly,</i>
<i>Michael ran into a brother...</i>

86
00:03:54,984 --> 00:03:56,861
I went to see Lucille 2,
and I lost control.

87
00:03:56,945 --> 00:03:59,447
I did something
that I wish I could forget.

88
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:02,492
<i>...who had also done something</i>
<i>he wanted Michael to forget.</i>

89
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:04,118
-Was that wax?
-[Gob] <i>Put the mask on!</i>

90
00:04:04,202 --> 00:04:08,039
[Ron] <i>Which is how he ended up drugged</i>
<i>on the floor of the model home...</i>

91
00:04:08,122 --> 00:04:12,085
-It's easy to forget.
<i>-...where he peacefully slept,</i>

92
00:04:12,168 --> 00:04:14,128
<i>deterring at least one badly needed buyer.</i>

93
00:04:14,212 --> 00:04:17,006
...some of the neighbors
are not to be desired. Oh!

94
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:19,050
One got in.
You know, I have other properties...

95
00:04:19,133 --> 00:04:21,761
[Ron] <i>And missing a visit</i>
<i>from </i>Predator Entrapment <i>host</i>

<i>John Beard, who had arrived to retrieve</i>

97

00:04:26,808 --> 00:04:30,019
{\an8}<i>like his predator hole</i>
<i>had been fished out.</i>

99
00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:33,022
<i>It would be another full night</i>

100
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:38,152
<i>before Michael would come up with a way</i>
<i>to work off his $700,000 debt...</i>

101
00:04:38,236 --> 00:04:39,445
...repay you that loan.

102
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:41,614
<i>...that he'd forgotten</i>
<i>he'd already come up with.</i>

103
00:04:43,324 --> 00:04:47,328
<i>It was the next call to the woman</i>
<i>he believed his son had broken up with...</i>

104
00:04:47,412 --> 00:04:51,207
The thing with the other guy,
we don't have to talk about that.

105

[Ron] <i>...that Michael would most regret.</i>

106
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:55,628
-Goodbye.
-[Ron] <i>But there would have to be</i>

107
00:04:55,712 --> 00:04:57,088
<i>one more conversation.</i>

108
00:04:57,171 --> 00:04:58,756
[George Michael] Who was that?

109
00:04:59,882 --> 00:05:00,800
No one.

110
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:06,639
[Ron] <i>Michael Bluth left</i>
<i>for his date with Rebel,</i>

112
00:05:09,892 --> 00:05:11,394
Boy, you guys don't miss a day.

113

-Yeah.

114
00:05:13,521 --> 00:05:16,691
-What, are you tenting the place?
-[laughs] Hey, Michael. Yeah.

115
00:05:16,774 --> 00:05:18,318
We're getting everything prepped.

116
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:21,529
Not sure if Maeby's in there,
or Tobias, or something?

117
00:05:21,654 --> 00:05:22,947
Mind if we use the stairs?

118
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:25,074
Gob said he heard something in the attic.

119
00:05:26,242 --> 00:05:27,535
Oh, yeah, uh, well...

120
00:05:28,745 --> 00:05:30,705
Hopefully, it's not my father. [chuckles]

121
00:05:30,788 --> 00:05:33,249
George Sr.! [laughs]

122
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:35,626
Okay.
This bug guy really knows our family.

123
00:05:36,044 --> 00:05:38,629
[Ron] <i>Michael went to find the source</i>
<i>of the noise,</i>

124
00:05:38,713 --> 00:05:41,632
<i>and soon came across a reminder</i>

00:05:41,716 --> 00:05:44,802
<i>and his dream of taking his son</i>
<i>on a scuba diving trip.</i>

126

-"Yes, I'm okay."
-Okay.

130
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:56,773
I've wanted to ask you that underwater.

131
00:05:56,856 --> 00:05:58,775
[Ron] <i>But soon,</i>

-[instructor] "Out of oxygen."

133

you're gonna need to know.

134
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:05,656
-[Michael] Mm-hmm.
-[instructor] Who remembers

135
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:07,658
-"shark"? Huh?
-[Michael] Shark, that's easy.

136
00:06:07,742 --> 00:06:10,161
-Yeah. Huh?
-[instructor] "Manta ray."

137
00:06:10,244 --> 00:06:12,497
But don't do that around the shark.
They eat them.

138
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:15,458
-[chuckles]
-[instructor] You got "boat," "jellyfish,"

139

"propeller," and "electric eel." Ouch!

140
00:06:18,544 --> 00:06:20,004
Okay. Let's hit the pool.

-Oh, yeah.

149
00:06:39,607 --> 00:06:41,150

Huh.
I thought we were going to the Reef.

152
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,657
We are. It's in the ocean.

153
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:49,909
I thought it was a restaurant
by the pool.

154
00:06:49,992 --> 00:06:52,412
Why did you think I said,
"Watch out for the crabs"?

155
00:06:52,495 --> 00:06:54,956
Why did you think I said,
"I always get a hamburger"?

-I thought you were kidding.

Michael. Hi.

170
00:07:30,491 --> 00:07:33,536
Am I that much of a monster, Michael?
Even to you?

171
00:07:33,619 --> 00:07:35,872
No, not at all,
I just wasn't expecting, uh,

172
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:39,250
you know, a man to be sitting
in a Scuba Jr.,

173
00:07:39,417 --> 00:07:41,252
leaping out at me
up in the attic, that's all.

-[both chuckling]
-That's all.

[whoops]

176
00:07:44,964 --> 00:07:46,716
I guess that is a little strange.

-You should've seen your face.
-Yeah, yeah, well...

178
00:07:50,094 --> 00:07:51,345
You looked like a little girl.

-Oh, God!

-Look at that.

181
00:07:56,225 --> 00:07:57,518
Got a new hand?

182
00:07:57,602 --> 00:07:58,769
No, I just took the skin off.

183
00:07:58,853 --> 00:08:00,396
-It's in the dryer.
-All right.

184
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:03,941
-Buddy, you cannot be up here, okay?
-The tent thing, I know.

185
00:08:04,025 --> 00:08:06,235
I mean, thank God
I found some scuba equipment

186
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:08,154
-because they are fumigating.
-[hand whirring]

187
00:08:08,237 --> 00:08:10,823
Yeah. The skin really muffles the sound
on that.

188
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:13,576
There's another suit over there;
it's a smaller size, though.

189
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:16,370
Uh... [stammers] That's my son's.

190
00:08:16,454 --> 00:08:18,247
-We never got a chance to use it.
-Oh.

191
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:20,541
Probably too young
to be around the fumes.

192
00:08:22,126 --> 00:08:25,505
No, pal, we were gonna use
this scuba gear for scuba diving.

193
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:26,756
-Mm.
-Underwater.

194
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:29,050
-Not to hang out in a poison cloud.
-Mm...

195
00:08:29,425 --> 00:08:31,427
It's father-son bonding
we never got to do.

196
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:33,221
-Aw.
-Put it on the long list of regrets.

197
00:08:33,304 --> 00:08:35,223
Well, I've had plenty of those
with Mom.

198
00:08:35,306 --> 00:08:37,725
-Have you?
-We used to want to play dress-up.

199

But we... [chuckles]

200

-That isn't a regret.

00:08:47,777 --> 00:08:49,195
-Yeah, no, it should be.
-Mm-hmm.

204
00:08:49,654 --> 00:08:51,447
So why are you here at the house?

205
00:08:51,906 --> 00:08:53,616
Ma said she asked you
to look after me.

206
00:08:55,159 --> 00:08:56,911
No. She actually didn't.

207
00:08:56,994 --> 00:08:58,913
And I <i>can't </i>look after you.

208
00:08:58,996 --> 00:09:00,623
And you cannot be here.

209
00:09:00,706 --> 00:09:03,834
You can't say I can't be here
and say you're not looking after me.

210
00:09:03,918 --> 00:09:05,503
Pick a lane, Michael!

211
00:09:05,586 --> 00:09:07,880
I can't believe she did that
without consideration

212
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:09,423
for what's going on in my life.

213
00:09:09,715 --> 00:09:11,717
Hope I never do that to my own, uh...

-Son.

-Ah. Oh, right.
-Hope I never do that to my son.

219
00:09:25,314 --> 00:09:28,067
Okay. Sorry.
 I got my own problems I gotta deal with.

220
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:29,819

-Now I'm a problem.
-No, you're not a problem.

Little help? The tank's heavy...

223
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:36,450
I gotcha.
Oh, you found the flippers, too, huh?

224
00:09:36,534 --> 00:09:38,578
-No, I don't need help.
-You don't? Or you do?

225
00:09:38,661 --> 00:09:40,788
-Oh, pick a lane, Michael.
-I'm trying to help.

00:09:40,871 --> 00:09:42,790
-Pick a lane, Buster.
-No, <i>you </i>pick a lane!

00:13:55,626 --> 00:13:57,211
Don't come up.
This place is crawling with cops.

319
00:13:57,294 --> 00:13:58,587
<i>I'll meet you there in a second.</i>

320
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:01,298
<i>I gotta figure out how to get out of here</i>
<i>without being noticed.</i>

321
00:14:01,382 --> 00:14:02,842
Okay, I'll meet you in the courtyard.

322
00:14:02,925 --> 00:14:04,301
-For my dog?
-[Maeby] Whoa!

323
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:06,345
Wow.

324
00:14:06,804 --> 00:14:07,888
You really snuck in.

325
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:10,516
Hey, you know
what might look cute on you,

326
00:14:10,599 --> 00:14:12,059
instead of that smock?

327
00:14:12,142 --> 00:14:14,353
Also, do you have any scissors?

328
00:14:14,436 --> 00:14:16,605
{\an8}-[Ron] <i>And moments later...</i>
-[phone buzzing]

329
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:18,315
{\an8}[Michael] Don't hang up,

330
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:19,692
-don't hang up...
-[Maeby] Okay.

331
00:14:19,775 --> 00:14:20,860
[Ron] <i>And soon, the cousins</i>

332
00:14:20,943 --> 00:14:23,153
<i>met up in the courtyard downstairs.</i>

333
00:14:24,321 --> 00:14:25,531
-[George Michael] Hey.
-Hey.

334
00:14:26,824 --> 00:14:28,993
-You were at Gangie's penthouse?
-Lucille 2.

335
00:14:29,743 --> 00:14:30,870
Wh...

336
00:14:30,953 --> 00:14:33,122
You drive her car.
How do you still not know who that is?

337
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:34,206
I punched my dad.

338
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:36,959
Wow. Uncle Michael?

339
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:38,460
-Yeah.
-Wow.

340
00:14:38,961 --> 00:14:40,838
You're burning bridges all over the place.

341
00:14:40,921 --> 00:14:42,214
I don't know what to do.

342
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:45,259
Well, for starters,
you could post it on <i>Dadfights.</i>

343
00:14:45,676 --> 00:14:46,552
Wait, that's a thing?

344
00:14:46,635 --> 00:14:49,138
It's just, like, a bunch of guys
punching their dads, or...?

345
00:14:49,221 --> 00:14:51,640
Yeah, well, you're supposed to say,
"Guess what, Dad,"

346
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:53,142
but some dads were catching on,

347
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:55,394
and they were just whaling on their kids.

348
00:14:55,477 --> 00:14:57,354
You can watch those clips
on <i>That'sWhatSon.</i>

349
00:14:58,022 --> 00:15:00,649
Well, my dad didn't hit me back,
which is even worse.

350
00:15:00,983 --> 00:15:03,152
Still, I mean,
he knew I was the other man.

351
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:04,486
For God knows how long.

352
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:07,323
It couldn't have been for long.
He didn't know when I told him.

353
00:15:08,198 --> 00:15:09,950
You told him I was dating Rebel?

354
00:15:10,492 --> 00:15:13,621
Well, technically, I said she was
dumping her boyfriend, but...

355
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:16,290
Yeah. I was hoping this would happen.

356
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:20,794
-Hey, you had fired me. I was... bored.
-Mad.

357
00:15:21,629 --> 00:15:24,256
I guess I need to apologize
to him or something.

358
00:15:24,632 --> 00:15:26,884
Well, if he said it was nothing
and now you apologize,

359
00:15:26,967 --> 00:15:28,552
you're gonna make it something.

360
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:32,306
I mean, what did Gangie always say?
"Forget, but never forgive."

361
00:15:33,265 --> 00:15:34,892
You think she meant to say it that way?

362
00:15:35,517 --> 00:15:36,977
-Yeah.
-Do you think "A friend in need

363
00:15:37,061 --> 00:15:39,480
is no friend indeed"
was also on purpose?

364
00:15:40,189 --> 00:15:42,399
What about "They should take
the rapists and murderers

365
00:15:42,483 --> 00:15:44,360
and put them all together
on an island...

366
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:46,779
"...and the murderers can be raped,
the rapists can be murdered...

367
00:15:46,862 --> 00:15:49,114
[both] until you only have either
two rapists or

368
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:50,366
-[Maeby] one murderer
-one raped murderer

369
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:53,035
-[both] but who cares about him?"
-Oh, was it "one <i>raped </i>murderer"?

370
00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:54,161
I've heard her say both.

371
00:15:54,745 --> 00:15:56,705
I mean, in all likelihood,
the guy would be raped.

372
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:58,916
I should call him and say I'm sorry.

373
00:15:58,999 --> 00:16:01,919
Look, if you apologize to him,
it's gonna make him feel horrible.

374
00:16:02,002 --> 00:16:03,087
[sighs]

375
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:04,964
So I think you should do it.

376
00:16:05,047 --> 00:16:06,882
[phone buzzing]

377
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:07,800
[grunts]

378
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:22,272
[Ron] <i>And so,</i>
<i>Michael left another message,</i>

379
00:16:22,356 --> 00:16:24,650
<i>careful not to make his son</i>

380
00:16:24,733 --> 00:16:26,402
<i>with an apology of his own.</i>

381
00:16:26,694 --> 00:16:28,404
I wanted to hit you back...

382
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:30,531
Uh... sorry, um...

383
00:16:30,614 --> 00:16:33,033
[stammering] I wanted to make
one thing clear, um...

384
00:16:33,117 --> 00:16:37,830
She, uh... She does not know
that we are father/son.

385
00:16:37,913 --> 00:16:40,708
That I was your, uh, your father.

386
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:42,334
Uh, that I <i>am </i>your father.

387
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:45,295
Okay? I will not apologize for that.
[chuckling] Okay?

388
00:16:45,379 --> 00:16:46,422
Or anything, really.

389
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:49,299
So, no pressure to call me back,

390
00:16:49,383 --> 00:16:52,928
but if you want, um,
you know, hit me back.

391
00:16:53,137 --> 00:16:55,264
Okay? Well... [chuckles]

392
00:16:55,347 --> 00:16:56,390
Again, sorry.

393
00:16:56,974 --> 00:16:58,392
Okay, bye.

394
00:16:59,768 --> 00:17:02,104
[Ron] <i>And while listening</i>
<i>to make sure the coast was clear,</i>

395
00:17:02,187 --> 00:17:04,815
<i>Michael noticed something</i>

396

[knocking on door]

397
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,031
Sorry to bother you.

398
00:17:12,114 --> 00:17:14,908
Apparently, Lucille Austero's missed
a couple of speaking engagements.

399
00:17:14,992 --> 00:17:16,076
We're trying to find her.

400
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,579
She-She's not in there?
I thought I heard her in there.

401
00:17:18,662 --> 00:17:20,539
No, it must have been
her housekeeper.

402
00:17:20,622 --> 00:17:22,291
Nobody's seen her since Cinco.

403
00:17:22,374 --> 00:17:23,834
Isn't today Cinco?

404
00:17:23,917 --> 00:17:24,960
Today's the sixth.

405
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:27,212
[Lucille 2 grunts]

406
00:17:27,379 --> 00:17:29,631
Huh. Well, I just talked
to her on the phone,

407
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:31,300
so she's somewhere.

408
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:34,219
-If you'll excuse me.
-You're Michael Bluth?

409
00:17:35,012 --> 00:17:37,347
-I am Michael Bluth.
-Did you write this note?

410
00:17:38,098 --> 00:17:40,017
Yeah, that's one of mine. Who are you?

411
00:17:40,184 --> 00:17:42,686
Uh, Newport Beach Police Department,
Lieutenant Toddler.

412
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:45,314
Ah. Officer.

413
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:47,441
-Yeah, hi. I was hoping you were a cop.
-Hi.

414
00:17:48,525 --> 00:17:50,569
-Always wanted to be a cop.
-Uh-huh.

415
00:17:50,652 --> 00:17:53,655
[stammering] But they just don't pay fair.

416
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:54,823
I do okay.

417
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:56,325
Hmm? Yeah, I'm sure you do.

418
00:17:56,408 --> 00:17:57,576
But, you know, you probably...

419
00:17:57,659 --> 00:18:00,370
you haven't had to pay for
a meal in years, though. Huh?

420
00:18:01,538 --> 00:18:03,916
I mean, I'm sure that you offer, yeah?

421
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,460
Do you talk to Ms. Austero often?

422
00:18:06,543 --> 00:18:08,629
I do not. Not often, no.
I barely know her.

423
00:18:08,712 --> 00:18:10,964
Really? 'Cause it says
right here that you love her.

424
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:14,510
It does, doesn't it? Yeah.

425
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:17,096
You know... [mumbling]
"Sorry we keep... love..."

426
00:18:17,179 --> 00:18:18,931
It's the way that I say goodbye.

427
00:18:19,014 --> 00:18:20,641
-Hmm.
-Um...

428
00:18:20,724 --> 00:18:22,434
because you never know, um...

429
00:18:23,227 --> 00:18:24,812
if you're never gonna see someone again.

430
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:27,147
You should know that.
You see people actually die.

431
00:18:27,231 --> 00:18:28,857
-I've seen one person die.
-Mm-hmm.

432
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:31,235
A postman.
Uh, was not my favorite day of the year...

433
00:18:31,318 --> 00:18:32,736
[chuckles] ...to say the least.

434
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:34,947
And he is the one that taught me

435
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:37,825
<i>-about loving each other.</i>
-[postman] Love each other.

436
00:18:37,908 --> 00:18:40,160
I guess this is sort of my way
of keeping him alive.

437
00:18:40,244 --> 00:18:41,203
[Ron] <i>No, it was not.</i>

438
00:18:41,286 --> 00:18:42,287
Is your mother here?

439
00:18:42,371 --> 00:18:45,082
My mother? No.
I'm-I'm all grown up, Toddler.

440
00:18:45,165 --> 00:18:47,334
Okay, 'cause my partner
was here yesterday,

441
00:18:47,417 --> 00:18:49,670
talked to someone who said
that she lived here.

442
00:18:49,753 --> 00:18:51,296
It was a woman with red hair.

443
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:54,383
[Ron] <i>In fact, it was George Sr.</i>

444
00:18:55,217 --> 00:18:58,679
<i>Who, after discovering he had</i>
<i>almost no testosterone at all</i>

445
00:18:58,762 --> 00:19:01,056
<i>was frightened and confused</i>

446
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:03,142
<i>and eager to hide from the world.</i>

447
00:19:04,017 --> 00:19:07,813
I don't allow men in my apartment
without my husband present.

448
00:19:08,063 --> 00:19:09,982
[Ron] <i>But George Sr. soon realized</i>

449
00:19:10,065 --> 00:19:11,567
<i>his impression of a woman</i>

450
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:13,610
<i>wasn't going to win him any awards.</i>

451
00:19:14,278 --> 00:19:17,531
<i>So he took off in his trailer</i>
<i>for Mexico</i> <i>to forget</i>

452

<i>-his shameful mistakes.</i>
-[sighs]

[Ron] <i>His son Gob, meanwhile,</i>
<i>was also in Mexico.</i>

454
00:19:22,286 --> 00:19:23,162
[Gob] Hey, there.

455
00:19:23,245 --> 00:19:27,916
Friend of mine left me a note,
um... in my handwriting,

456
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:30,669
and he said that you might be able
to set me up with the pill

457
00:19:30,752 --> 00:19:34,131
that makes the memories go away,
like a... like a shame-wow.

458
00:19:34,214 --> 00:19:36,967
[Ron] <i>A request he'd made over 500 times.</i>

459
00:19:37,426 --> 00:19:40,345
See, I did something
a little out of character. [chuckles]

460
00:19:40,721 --> 00:19:44,600
And, um, the window's kind of
closing in on, you know,

461
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:46,810
before it lodges in the long-term, um...

462
00:19:47,936 --> 00:19:49,396
What do you call it? Um...

463
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:53,066
What do you call it?

464
00:19:55,485 --> 00:19:56,528
Brains.

465
00:19:57,487 --> 00:19:58,822
Long-term brains.

468

-[speaking Spanish]
-Wish her a Happy Five, by the way.

470

-Happy Five.
-Oh, thank you.

...[bleeps] our way through Mexico?

485
00:20:45,619 --> 00:20:46,912
[Ron] <i>This wouldn't be an option</i>

486
00:20:46,995 --> 00:20:49,790
<i>for George Sr., which is why he replied...</i>

487
00:20:49,998 --> 00:20:52,209
Mexico won't be able to walk for a week.

488
00:20:52,292 --> 00:20:53,877
[laughs]

489
00:20:53,961 --> 00:20:55,295
Two full weeks!

490
00:20:56,922 --> 00:20:59,549
-[Ron] <i>Michael knew none of this.</i>
-[Michael] <i>That's impossible.</i>

491
00:20:59,633 --> 00:21:00,884
My mother's got brown hair.

492
00:21:00,968 --> 00:21:02,511
You don't know anyone with red hair?

493
00:21:02,594 --> 00:21:05,889
No, I don't know anyone...
Well, I know...

494
00:21:06,139 --> 00:21:07,683
I'm just ending something right now

495
00:21:07,766 --> 00:21:09,559
with a woman who has red hair,
Rebel Alley.

496
00:21:09,643 --> 00:21:10,852
Oh, Ron Howard's daughter.

497
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:12,562
That's the one. And Ron's got red hair.

498
00:21:12,646 --> 00:21:15,482
So, I guess that's two people
I know with red hair.

499
00:21:17,401 --> 00:21:20,862
Of course, I'm holding a wig
that is made of red hair.

500
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:24,700
So that's those two and the wig,
I think that's got it.

501
00:21:24,783 --> 00:21:28,203
And my sister has recently
gotten the red hair.

502
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:29,663
But she's nuts, so...

503
00:21:29,746 --> 00:21:32,082
[Ron] <i>Actually, Lindsay</i>
<i>had been hiding her identity</i>

504
00:21:32,165 --> 00:21:35,252
<i>with that very wig while dating</i>
<i>a right-wing candidate</i>

505
00:21:35,335 --> 00:21:37,004
<i>whose positions she opposed...</i>

506
00:21:37,087 --> 00:21:37,921
I can't do this

507
00:21:38,005 --> 00:21:40,507
unless you promise to be against the wall.

508
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:41,800
What the hell?

509
00:21:41,883 --> 00:21:43,218
<i>...and was determined to change.</i>

510
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:44,970
-Better for my back, anyway.
-Thank you.

511
00:21:45,053 --> 00:21:47,806
[Ron] <i>But soon, photos of Herbert Love</i>
<i>with a mystery redhead</i>

512
00:21:47,889 --> 00:21:49,516
<i>were used to blackmail her.</i>

513
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:51,560
-God, that was a photo booth?
-Mm-hmm.

514
00:21:51,643 --> 00:21:54,229
[Ron] <i>So, it was only once</i>
<i>she ditched the red hair...</i>

515
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:56,481
I'm a Bluth and so are you.

516
00:21:56,565 --> 00:22:00,068
<i>-...that she joined the opposition.</i>
-[chanting] Put up this wall!

517
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:02,321
[Ron] <i>Unfortunately,</i>
<i>her candidate encountered</i>

518
00:22:02,404 --> 00:22:03,530
<i>some new opposition.</i>

519
00:22:03,655 --> 00:22:04,990
-[yells]
-[officer] <i>We have an unconscious</i>

520
00:22:05,073 --> 00:22:06,366
black male choosing not to comply.

521
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:08,243
[Ron] <i>Having discovered</i>
<i>he dropped out of the race...</i>

522
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:09,745
[officer] Aggressively come at me!

523
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:12,831
<i>...Lindsay's political enthusiasm waned.</i>

524
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:16,001
[Michael] <i>So, I have no idea where she is,</i>

525
00:22:16,084 --> 00:22:18,670
but, uh, my mother is at Austerity.
It's a rehab clinic.

526
00:22:18,754 --> 00:22:21,673
Actually, we checked the rehab
and your mother wasn't there.

527
00:22:21,757 --> 00:22:24,009
[Ron] <i>Actually, when Lucille 2</i>
<i>first went missing,</i>

528
00:22:24,092 --> 00:22:27,596
<i>Lucille 1 took the opportunity</i>
<i>to compel her therapist</i>

529
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:31,433
<i>to change her status</i>
<i>from in- to outpatient,</i>

530
00:22:31,516 --> 00:22:34,269
<i>bypassing both</i>
<i>the Austerity Clinic's red tape</i>

531
00:22:34,936 --> 00:22:36,772
<i>as well as its security tape.</i>

532
00:22:40,025 --> 00:22:43,904
And she was remanded to the care
of your brother-in-law, Tobias Funghi?

533
00:22:43,987 --> 00:22:45,739
-F...
-You don't happen to know

534
00:22:45,822 --> 00:22:48,200
the license plate of the car he drives,
do you?

535
00:22:48,283 --> 00:22:49,826
His license plate number? No, I don't.

536
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:53,246
I barely know my own license plate number,
much less my brother-in...

537
00:22:53,997 --> 00:22:57,918
It's A-N-U-S
and then for some reason T-A-R-T.

538
00:22:58,668 --> 00:22:59,711
"A new start."

539
00:23:00,837 --> 00:23:03,215
If you saw it written out,
I don't think that you would...

540
00:23:03,298 --> 00:23:07,052
Let me try this one on you.
A-N-A-L-R-A-P...

541
00:23:07,135 --> 00:23:09,221
Well, it doesn't matter.
Listen, I gotta go.

542
00:23:09,304 --> 00:23:12,224
I don't know where my mother
and Tobias are, excuse me,

543
00:23:12,307 --> 00:23:13,809
but they're clearly up to something.

544
00:23:13,892 --> 00:23:15,560
They're not gonna be easy to get back.

545
00:23:15,644 --> 00:23:18,355
Well, Ms. Austero isn't quite
a missing person yet.

546
00:23:18,563 --> 00:23:21,566
We are particularly interested
in talking to Byron,

547
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:23,443
who she apparently
had a relationship with.

548
00:23:23,527 --> 00:23:26,822
It's Buster. Uh, and that's why I know
that they're up to something,

549
00:23:26,905 --> 00:23:29,991
'cause the last time
that I saw Buster was, um...

550
00:23:30,075 --> 00:23:31,493
-Oh, God!
-[yells]

551
00:23:31,576 --> 00:23:33,954
[Ron] <i>And, resentful of his family,</i>

552
00:23:34,037 --> 00:23:36,498
<i>Michael came up with a plan</i>
<i>to make them come back.</i>

553
00:23:36,581 --> 00:23:38,166
Tell me how
this missing person thing works.

554
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:40,669
-You want to report him missing?
-I might.

555
00:23:40,752 --> 00:23:44,464
You'd call it in,
but not until he's been gone for 72 hours.

556
00:23:44,548 --> 00:23:46,800
Hmm. I think it's worth the wait.

557
00:23:46,883 --> 00:23:48,510
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, okay.

558
00:23:48,593 --> 00:23:51,221
That's what we'll do.
Find Buster, you're gonna find Lucille.

559
00:23:51,304 --> 00:23:52,347
Which one?

560
00:23:52,431 --> 00:23:53,598
I don't think he cares.

561
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:56,393
See you later.

562
00:23:58,395 --> 00:23:59,771
Thank you for your service.

563
00:24:02,232 --> 00:24:03,191
Love you.

564
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:04,776

565
00:24:09,448 --> 00:24:13,577
[Ron] <i>Lindsay arrives at the border</i>
<i>she had just called for a wall to protect.</i>

566
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:15,287
[Lindsay] Oh, they have one.

567
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:18,582
[laughs nervously]

568
00:24:18,665 --> 00:24:20,542
[speaking Spanish]

569
00:24:20,625 --> 00:24:21,877
He wants your passport.

570
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,879
Oh, I didn't bring a... [scoffs]
I'm American.

571
00:24:23,962 --> 00:24:25,630
How do you say "I'm American"
in Mexican?

572
00:24:25,714 --> 00:24:26,965
<i>Soy americano.</i>

573
00:24:27,048 --> 00:24:30,135
Hmm. That does sound good.
Ask him for two.

574
00:24:31,178 --> 00:24:32,471
[Ron] <i>Lindsay is proud</i>

575
00:24:32,554 --> 00:24:34,556
<i>that she thought to include her driver.</i>

576

<i>And Lucille and her therapist arrive</i>

<i>-at their beachside </i>casita.
-[Lucille] Look at them.

578
00:24:40,937 --> 00:24:43,690
Dancing on the beach
like they own the place.

579
00:24:44,649 --> 00:24:47,110
Good. We'll use that.

580
00:24:47,194 --> 00:24:49,196
I want to laser in on that anger.

581
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:50,697
Look out at the ocean.

582
00:24:51,114 --> 00:24:53,783
Tell me, what does it make you think?

583
00:24:54,367 --> 00:24:57,537
Like, "Everyone's having fun but me,

584
00:24:57,621 --> 00:25:00,081
running and laughing and...

585
00:25:00,165 --> 00:25:02,042
I feel like men run away from me.

586
00:25:02,125 --> 00:25:04,920
-I'm stuck here doing therapy."
-I've been deserted.

587
00:25:05,003 --> 00:25:07,881
Is that my fault?
Is it because of my anger?

588
00:25:08,965 --> 00:25:11,843
When I see a squirrelly,
little fruitcake like that one

589
00:25:11,927 --> 00:25:14,012
skipping into the ocean, I think,

590
00:25:14,095 --> 00:25:17,891
-"Why do I hate him so much?"
-[man laughing outside]

591
00:25:17,974 --> 00:25:20,602

with the fringed cut-offs who...
