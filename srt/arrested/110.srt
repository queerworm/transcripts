00:00:01,417 --> 00:00:02,418
narrator: NOW THE STORY

2
00:00:02,418 --> 00:00:04,462
OF A WEALTHY FAMILY 
WHO LOST EVERYTHING

3
00:00:04,462 --> 00:00:06,005
AND THE ONE SON 
WHO HAD NO CHOICE

4
00:00:06,005 --> 00:00:08,424
BUT TO KEEP THEM ALL TOGETHER.

5
00:00:13,471 --> 00:00:16,557
IT'S "ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT."

6
00:00:21,187 --> 00:00:23,356
narrator: MICHAEL BLUTH 
WAS TALKING TO HIS SON

7
00:00:23,356 --> 00:00:24,607
ABOUT HIS LATEST TEST.

8
00:00:24,607 --> 00:00:25,608
- A-MINUS, HUH?

9
00:00:25,608 --> 00:00:26,817
- PROUD OF ME?

10
00:00:26,817 --> 00:00:30,113
- VERY PROUD 
MINUS.

11
00:00:30,113 --> 00:00:33,408
BETTER GO HIT THE BOOKS AGAIN. 
GET UP THERE.

12
00:00:33,408 --> 00:00:37,703
- C-MINUS. 
"C" M-I-N-E-S.

13
00:00:37,703 --> 00:00:38,704
- DID YOU EVEN STUDY?

14
00:00:38,704 --> 00:00:40,498
- NO, I DIDN'T.

15
00:00:40,498 --> 00:00:44,835
- WOW. 
HOW IMPRESSIVE IS THAT?

16
00:00:44,835 --> 00:00:46,504
- WELL, THE BAR 
FOR THE REFRIGERATOR

17
00:00:46,504 --> 00:00:47,463
HAS BEEN LOWERED, HUH?

18
00:00:47,463 --> 00:00:49,465
- OH, GRADES ARE MEANINGLESS.

19
00:00:49,465 --> 00:00:51,634
MAEBY'S LAST SCHOOL DIDN'T 
EVEN HAVE THEM.

20
00:00:51,634 --> 00:00:52,968
narrator: BACK IN BOSTON,

21
00:00:52,968 --> 00:00:55,513
MAEBY'S PARENTS HAD ENROLLED HER 
IN A PROGRESSIVE SCHOOL

22
00:00:55,513 --> 00:00:58,391
WITH ITS OWN SYSTEM 
OF EVALUATION.

23
00:00:58,391 --> 00:00:59,392
- ALL I'M SAYING, LINDSAY,

24
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:01,561
IS THAT, YOU KNOW, YOU MIGHT 
WANT TO PUSH HER A LITTLE BIT.

25
00:01:01,561 --> 00:01:02,895
BECAUSE A KID WITHOUT DISCIPLINE

26
00:01:02,895 --> 00:01:04,355
CAN GET INTO SOME 
PRETTY TOUGH STUFF.

27
00:01:04,355 --> 00:01:06,274
- SO YOU THINK SHE'S GONNA 
SUDDENLY TURN TO DRUGS

28
00:01:06,274 --> 00:01:07,275
'CAUSE SHE GOT A C-PLUS?

29
00:01:07,275 --> 00:01:09,652
- MINUS. AND, YES, I THINK 
THAT, WITHOUT BOUNDARIES,

30
00:01:09,652 --> 00:01:10,695
A KID CAN GET INTO TROUBLE.

31
00:01:10,695 --> 00:01:12,697
AND YES, SOMETIMES 
THAT COULD MEAN DRUGS.

32
00:01:12,697 --> 00:01:14,907
- WELL, I THINK STRESS 
IS WHAT LEADS TO TROUBLE,

33
00:01:14,907 --> 00:01:16,326
YOU KNOW THE KIND YOU PUT 
ON GEORGE MICHAEL,

34
00:01:16,326 --> 00:01:17,993
EVEN WHEN HE GETS AN "A."

35
00:01:17,993 --> 00:01:18,994
- MINUS.

36
00:01:18,994 --> 00:01:21,456
AND AN "A" GETS HIM ICE CREAM. 
HE KNOWS THAT.

37
00:01:21,456 --> 00:01:24,334
- SEE, YOU'RE AS BAD AS DAD 
WITH HIS RIDICULOUS LESSONS.

38
00:01:24,334 --> 00:01:27,503
narrator: GEORGE SR. HAD 
USED HIS CONSIDERABLE MEANS

39
00:01:27,503 --> 00:01:30,506
TO STAGE INTRICATE SCENARIOS 
TO TEACH HIS CHILDREN

40
00:01:30,506 --> 00:01:32,758
WHAT HE CONSIDERED 
VALUABLE LIFE LESSONS.

41
00:01:32,758 --> 00:01:33,759
- I NEED HELP.

42
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:34,802
- I'LL GET MY GEAR.

43
00:01:34,802 --> 00:01:37,180
narrator: TYPICALLY, THESE 
SCENARIOS WOULD INVOLVE A MAN

44
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:39,515
NAMED J. WALTER WEATHERMAN,

45
00:01:39,515 --> 00:01:41,559
A ONE-TIME EMPLOYEE 
WHO LOST HIS ARM

46
00:01:41,559 --> 00:01:43,269
IN A BLUTH COMPANY 
CONSTRUCTION ACCIDENT.

47
00:01:43,269 --> 00:01:44,687
[whimpers]

48
00:01:44,687 --> 00:01:47,190
- WHY ARE YOU HITTING YOURSELF? 
WHY ARE YOU HITTING YOURSELF?

49
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:49,024
- WE'RE OUT OF MILK. 
I COULD HAVE GOT IT EARLIER

50
00:01:49,024 --> 00:01:50,776
IF SOMEONE WOULD HAVE 
LEFT A NOTE.

51
00:01:50,776 --> 00:01:51,777
[tires screech]

52
00:01:51,777 --> 00:01:53,529
OH. 
[grunts]

53
00:01:53,529 --> 00:01:56,741
[all screaming]

54
00:01:56,741 --> 00:01:59,285
- WHY? IF SOMEONE 
HAD LEFT A NOTE,

55
00:01:59,285 --> 00:02:01,871
THIS-THIS INNOCENT MAN 
WOULD STILL HAVE HIS ARM.

56
00:02:01,871 --> 00:02:02,872
WHY?

57
00:02:02,872 --> 00:02:05,040
[screaming continues]

58
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:09,462
- AND THAT'S WHY 
YOU ALWAYS LEAVE A NOTE.

59
00:02:09,462 --> 00:02:11,464
- WELL, THOSE LESSONS WORKED, 
DIDN'T THEY?

60
00:02:11,464 --> 00:02:13,591
I MEAN, WE STILL 
LEAVE NOTES TO THIS DAY.

61
00:02:13,591 --> 00:02:15,635
- OH, THAT'S WHAT 
THAT WAS ABOUT.

62
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:18,095
I THOUGHT HE WAS TRYING 
TO GET US OFF DAIRY.

63
00:02:18,095 --> 00:02:19,096
- I NEED A FAVOR.

64
00:02:19,096 --> 00:02:21,015
- WHAT HAPPENED TO, 
"HELLO. I NEED A FAVOR"?

65
00:02:21,015 --> 00:02:23,601
- I OWE HOT COPS 500 BUCKS.

66
00:02:23,601 --> 00:02:24,602
- "HOT COPS"?

67
00:02:24,602 --> 00:02:26,396
- IT'S THE STRIPPING AGENCY 
I USED TO WORK FOR.

68
00:02:26,396 --> 00:02:27,438
COP UNIFORM.

69
00:02:27,438 --> 00:02:28,439
- RIGHT.

70
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:30,858
- YOU KNOW, I MIGHT HAVE BEEN 
JUST A LITTLE TOO BELIEVABLE.

71
00:02:30,858 --> 00:02:35,070
[disco music]

72
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:36,071
[pounding]

73
00:02:36,071 --> 00:02:38,533
POLICE! OPEN UP!

74
00:02:38,533 --> 00:02:40,826
[shotgun blast]

75
00:02:46,582 --> 00:02:48,959
ANYWAY, THEY'RE CLAIMING THAT I 
NEVER DELIVERED ON THE GIG.

76
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:49,960
- I'M NOT AN A.T.M.

77
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:52,129
- MICHAEL, I KEEP FORGETTING 
HOW HILARIOUS YOU ARE.

78
00:02:52,129 --> 00:02:53,756
- SHH, SHH, SHH. 
YOU'RE MAKING IT WORSE.

79
00:02:53,756 --> 00:02:54,757
- AM I?

80
00:02:54,757 --> 00:02:56,426
- TELL YOU WHAT. 
I'M GONNA GIVE YOU THE CASH,

81
00:02:56,426 --> 00:02:59,094
BUT IN RETURN, I GET TO 
ASK YOU FOR A FAVOR SOMETIME.

82
00:02:59,094 --> 00:03:03,098
- MY GUT IS TELLING ME "NO," 
BUT MY GUT IS ALSO VERY HUNGRY.

83
00:03:03,098 --> 00:03:05,851
ALL RIGHT. I'LL DO IT.

84
00:03:05,851 --> 00:03:08,646
narrator: MICHAEL THEN LEFT 
FOR HIS MOTHER'S APARTMENT,

85
00:03:08,646 --> 00:03:12,024
WHERE SHE GREETED HIM WITH 
SOME NOT-SO-SURPRISING NEWS.

86
00:03:12,024 --> 00:03:13,025
- I NEED A FAVOR.

87
00:03:13,025 --> 00:03:14,777
- WE OUGHT TO PUT THAT 
ON OUR FAMILY CREST.

88
00:03:14,777 --> 00:03:15,861
- [laughing] 
OH, MICHAEL--

89
00:03:15,861 --> 00:03:17,071
- SPARE ME.

90
00:03:17,071 --> 00:03:21,284
- THE S.E.C. IS MAKING ME 
INVENTORY EVERYTHING I OWN.

91
00:03:21,284 --> 00:03:22,285
THEY WANT ME TO PROVE

92
00:03:22,285 --> 00:03:24,412
NO NEW PURCHASES HAVE BEEN MADE 
WITH COMPANY MONEY.

93
00:03:24,412 --> 00:03:25,621
- AND THERE HAVEN'T BEEN, RIGHT?

94
00:03:25,621 --> 00:03:27,873
- NOT AFTER WE DOCTOR 
ALL THESE RECEIPTS.

95
00:03:27,873 --> 00:03:29,875
- I CAN'T HELP YOU, MOM. 
I'VE GOT A JOB.

96
00:03:29,875 --> 00:03:30,793
I GOTTA MAKE SOME MONEY,

97
00:03:30,793 --> 00:03:32,337
SO YOU CAN BUY MORE THINGS 
AND DESTROY THE EVIDENCE.

98
00:03:32,337 --> 00:03:33,338
- YOU'RE RIGHT.

99
00:03:33,338 --> 00:03:35,590
I'LL ASK LINDSAY.

100
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:37,508
[door closes]

101
00:03:37,508 --> 00:03:38,509
- HEY, BUSTER.

102
00:03:38,509 --> 00:03:39,385
- HEY, BROTHER.

103
00:03:39,385 --> 00:03:40,970
- YOU HEADED OVER 
TO YOUR GIRLFRIEND'S?

104
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:43,138
- YEAH. SHE'S DOWN AGAIN.

105
00:03:43,138 --> 00:03:46,058
narrator: BUSTER'S 
GIRLFRIEND, LUCILLE AUSTERO,

106
00:03:46,058 --> 00:03:48,102
SUFFERS FROM CHRONIC VERTIGO,

107
00:03:48,102 --> 00:03:49,604
WHICH SHE HAS BEEN 
TRYING TO FIGHT

108
00:03:49,604 --> 00:03:51,647
WITHOUT THE USE OF MEDICATION.

109
00:03:51,647 --> 00:03:53,274
- AND HER NAUSEA'S 
GOTTEN REALLY BAD TOO.

110
00:03:53,274 --> 00:03:55,150
IT'S REALLY BEEN 
DIFFICULT ON US.

111
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:57,194
IT'S DEFINITELY 
TAKING ITS TOLL.

112
00:03:57,194 --> 00:03:58,738
- WELL, YOU KNOW 
YOU'RE FREE TO GO, PAL.

113
00:03:58,738 --> 00:04:00,072
IT'S NOT LIKE YOU MADE 
A COMMITMENT TO THIS WOMAN.

114
00:04:00,072 --> 00:04:02,700
- WELL, I DIDN'T MAKE 
A "COMMITMENT."

115
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:04,827
I DID REFER TO IT 
AS OUR NAUSEA.

116
00:04:04,827 --> 00:04:05,828
- MM.

117
00:04:05,828 --> 00:04:06,829
- BUT YOU KNOW,

118
00:04:06,829 --> 00:04:10,625
THAT'S WHEN WE WERE GOIN' AT IT 
REALLY HOT AND HEAVY.

119
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:12,668
- WELL, NOW IT'S MY NAUSEA.

120
00:04:12,668 --> 00:04:15,421
narrator: LATER, LUCILLE 
STOPPED BY THE MODEL HOME

121
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:18,549
TO ENLIST HER DAUGHTER'S HELP 
CATALOGING HER VALUABLES.

122
00:04:18,549 --> 00:04:20,301
- I CAN'T. 
- WHY NOT?

123
00:04:20,301 --> 00:04:23,388
BECAUSE I'M-- 
DON'T WANT TO.

124
00:04:23,388 --> 00:04:25,265
WELL, MAYBE I DON'T FEEL 
LIKE BEING CRITICIZED

125
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:26,266
AROUND THE CLOCK.

126
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:28,601
- I DON'T CRITICIZE YOU.

127
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:30,185
AND IF YOU'RE WORRIED 
ABOUT CRITICISM,

128
00:04:30,185 --> 00:04:34,440
SOMETIMES A DIET 
IS THE BEST DEFENSE.

129
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,441
- OH, HEY, GANGY.

130
00:04:35,441 --> 00:04:36,526
- HI.

131
00:04:36,526 --> 00:04:39,529
- D-PLUS. 
SIGN THIS.

132
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:40,863
- THIS IS A D-MINUS.

133
00:04:40,863 --> 00:04:42,573
- WELL, EITHER WAY, 
IT'S ABOVE A "D," RIGHT?

134
00:04:42,573 --> 00:04:44,367
- ANOTHER WORLD-BEATER.

135
00:04:44,367 --> 00:04:45,660
narrator: 
AND LINDSAY REALIZED

136
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:49,204
SHE NEEDED TO TAKE A FIRMER HAND 
WITH HER DAUGHTER.

137
00:04:49,204 --> 00:04:50,205
- I'M NOT SIGNING THIS.

138
00:04:50,205 --> 00:04:53,000
- FINE. I WILL.

139
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,044
IS "LINDSAY" 
WITH AN "A" OR AN "E"?

140
00:04:55,044 --> 00:04:57,171
- OKAY, LOOK, I KNOW YOU GOT 
A "CROCODILE" IN SPELLING,

141
00:04:57,171 --> 00:04:59,799
BUT THIS HAS GONE TOO FAR.

142
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:01,967
I HATE TO SAY IT, 
BUT MICHAEL MIGHT BE RIGHT.

143
00:05:01,967 --> 00:05:04,053
YOU NEED TO LEARN 
A LITTLE DISCIPLINE.

144
00:05:04,053 --> 00:05:06,472
- HMM. 
NOPE, THAT DOESN'T FEEL RIGHT.

145
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:09,434
- NO, NO, NO. 
I'M TELLING YOU.

146
00:05:09,434 --> 00:05:12,395
YOU ARE NOW PUNISHED. 
I PUNISH THEE.

147
00:05:12,395 --> 00:05:13,729
- ARE YOU SERIOUS?

148
00:05:13,729 --> 00:05:15,690
WHAT COULD YOU 
POSSIBLY COME UP WITH

149
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:16,482
THAT WOULD PUNISH ME?

150
00:05:16,482 --> 00:05:18,443
- OH, I HAVE TO COME UP 
WITH ANOTHER THING?

151
00:05:18,443 --> 00:05:24,073
- OH, LINDSAY, BEFORE I GO, 
I JUST HAVE ONE WORD FOR YOU.

152
00:05:24,073 --> 00:05:26,826
"SLEEVES."

153
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:30,079
- YOU'RE GOING TO SPEND THE DAY 
WORKING FOR YOUR GRANDMOTHER.

154
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:35,042
- NO. NO, THAT'S NOT THE ANSWER, 
BECAUSE YOU--

155
00:05:35,042 --> 00:05:37,795
WHAT? NO! YOU STUPID JERK! 
WHY DON'T--

156
00:05:37,795 --> 00:05:40,798
DUMB. DUMB. 
DUMB, GEORGE MICHAEL.

157
00:05:40,798 --> 00:05:43,092
DUMB, DUMB. 
- WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

158
00:05:43,092 --> 00:05:45,928
CALM DOWN, YOU TWO. 
IT'S JUST A MATH PROBLEM.

159
00:05:45,928 --> 00:05:47,722
- YEAH, BUT IF I FAIL MATH, 
THERE GOES MY CHANCE

160
00:05:47,722 --> 00:05:49,515
AT A GOOD JOB AND A HAPPY LIFE 
FULL OF HARD WORK,

161
00:05:49,515 --> 00:05:50,933
LIKE YOU ALWAYS SAY.

162
00:05:50,933 --> 00:05:55,229
- [sighs] 
MAYBE I'M PUSHING YOU TOO HARD.

163
00:05:55,229 --> 00:05:57,440
YOU'RE ALL STRESSED OUT. 
YOUR EYES ARE ALL RED.

164
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,733
WHY DON'T YOU 
TAKE THE NIGHT OFF.

165
00:05:58,733 --> 00:05:59,900
JUST SHUT THE BOOK.

166
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:03,654
GO AHEAD. 
JUST CLOSE THE BOOK.

167
00:06:05,948 --> 00:06:07,116
GO AHEAD.

168
00:06:10,285 --> 00:06:12,204
YOUR FINGER 
IS STILL IN THE BOOK.

169
00:06:14,624 --> 00:06:16,208
GEORGE MICHAEL.

170
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:28,596
narrator: BUSTER, MEANWHILE, WAS 
STILL WORRIED ABOUT LUCILLE 2,

171
00:06:28,596 --> 00:06:30,640
WHOSE CONDITION 
SEEMED TO BE WORSENING.

172
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:33,267
- YOU OKAY? 
HOW'S YOUR NAUSEA?

173
00:06:33,267 --> 00:06:35,310
- [moaning] 
"OUR."

174
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:38,230
-  I MEAN, OUR-- 
OUR NAUSEA.

175
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:40,983
narrator: HE REMEMBERED A STUDY 
HE TOOK PART IN

176
00:06:40,983 --> 00:06:45,320
ON MEDICAL MARIJUANA 
AND ITS EFFECTS ON NAUSEA.

177
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:50,493
THE SUBJECT TOOK THE DRUG 
IN THE FORM OF A T.H.C. PILL.

178
00:06:50,493 --> 00:06:53,328
NAUSEA WAS THEN INDUCED 
WITH A DAY AT THE CARNIVAL,

179
00:06:53,328 --> 00:06:55,831
WHICH IS WHAT ATTRACTED 
BUSTER TO THE EXPERIMENT

180
00:06:55,831 --> 00:06:57,833
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

181
00:06:57,833 --> 00:07:00,085
BUSTER WAS FOUND 
TWO DAYS LATER

182
00:07:00,085 --> 00:07:03,673
TRYING TO EAT HIS WAY THROUGH 
THIS ENORMOUS PLASTER DONUT.

183
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:08,678
SO BUSTER WENT TO THE TOUGHEST, 
MOST STREETWISE KID HE KNEW.

184
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:09,679
- TELL YOUR FRIENDS.

185
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:12,389
- HEY, NEPHEW. I WAS LOOKING 
FOR YOU AT YOUR HOME.

186
00:07:12,389 --> 00:07:14,016
- OH, YEAH, DAD TOLD ME 
TO TAKE THE DAY OFF,

187
00:07:14,016 --> 00:07:15,518
SO I DECIDED TO COME INTO WORK. 
- OH.

188
00:07:15,518 --> 00:07:17,478
SO I THOUGHT MAYBE YOU COULD 
HELP ME GET SOME WEED.

189
00:07:17,478 --> 00:07:19,021
- [utensil clatters]

190
00:07:19,021 --> 00:07:20,022
IT'S NOT FOR ME.

191
00:07:20,022 --> 00:07:22,232
IT'S FOR LUCILLE 2, 
MY GIRLFRIEND.

192
00:07:22,232 --> 00:07:23,233
- SHE'S YOUR GIRLFRIEND?

193
00:07:23,233 --> 00:07:25,653
DAD SAID YOU WERE HER NURSE.

194
00:07:25,653 --> 00:07:27,279
- LOOK, SHE'S SICK. 
THIS COULD HELP HER.

195
00:07:27,279 --> 00:07:28,864
PILLFORM WOULD ACTUALLY 
BE FANTASTIC

196
00:07:28,864 --> 00:07:30,658
BECAUSE I COULD PUT IT ON A 
LITTLE TEA BISCUIT,

197
00:07:30,658 --> 00:07:32,409
AND I COULD JUST TELL HER 
IT'S A MARSHMALLOW.

198
00:07:32,409 --> 00:07:33,243
- LOOK, I HAVE NO IDEA

199
00:07:33,243 --> 00:07:34,829
WHERE TO GET SOMETHING 
LIKE THAT, OKAY?

200
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:35,955
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK I WOULD?

201
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:36,956
- WELL, YOU WORK HERE.

202
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:38,708
THIS PLACE 
IS POT CENTRAL, RIGHT?

203
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:40,960
narrator: IN THE '70s, 
THE BOARDWALK WAS THE PLACE

204
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,921
TO BUY MARIJUANA 
IN NEWPORT BEACH.

205
00:07:43,921 --> 00:07:46,048
THE STAND SERVED 
AS A CONVENIENT MEETING PLACE

206
00:07:46,048 --> 00:07:47,550
BECAUSE OF 
THE BANANA'S RESEMBLANCE

207
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:50,470
TO A YELLOW MARIJUANA CIGARETTE.

208
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:51,554
IT HAD EVEN INSPIRED A SONG.

209
00:07:51,554 --> 00:07:54,890
- [singing] BIG YELLOW JOINT 
THE BIG YELLOW JOINT

210
00:07:54,890 --> 00:07:58,102
I'LL MEET YOU DOWN 
AT THE BIG YELLOW JOINT

211
00:07:58,102 --> 00:07:59,979
- LOOK, I'M SORRY. 
I CAN'T HELP YOU, OKAY?

212
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:01,564
WHY DON'T YOU 
JUST ASK UNCLE GOB?

213
00:08:01,564 --> 00:08:04,399
- WHY ARE YOU HITTING YOURSELF? 
WHY ARE YOU HITTING YOURSELF?

214
00:08:04,399 --> 00:08:07,528
- NO. NO. 
HE'D NEVER DO IT.

215
00:08:07,528 --> 00:08:10,322
BESIDES, HE ALWAYS MAKES FUN OF 
ME FOR DATING LUCILLE.

216
00:08:10,322 --> 00:08:11,323
EVERYBODY DOES.

217
00:08:11,323 --> 00:08:12,407
- THAT'S HORRIBLE.

218
00:08:12,407 --> 00:08:14,243
- LOOK, MAYBE YOU COULD 
TELL GOB FOR ME,

219
00:08:14,243 --> 00:08:15,745
BUT YOU CAN'T TELL HIM 
IT'S FOR ME.

220
00:08:15,745 --> 00:08:17,287
YOU CAN'T TELL ANYBODY. 
- I'M WORKING.

221
00:08:17,287 --> 00:08:19,123
- GEORGE MICHAEL. 
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

222
00:08:19,123 --> 00:08:21,291
I THOUGHT I TOLD YOU 
TO TAKE THE DAY OFF.

223
00:08:21,291 --> 00:08:22,627
- YEAH, BUT THERE'S 
NOTHING TO DO.

224
00:08:22,627 --> 00:08:23,711
I MEAN, MAEBY'S AT GANGY'S.

225
00:08:23,711 --> 00:08:24,587
- FIND SOMETHING TO DO.

226
00:08:24,587 --> 00:08:26,421
GO MAKE MISTAKES, 
GET IN TROUBLE--BE YOUNG.

227
00:08:26,421 --> 00:08:29,258
- YES! I TOTALLY AGREE. 
MAKE A MISTAKE.

228
00:08:29,258 --> 00:08:30,300
- NOW HERE. HERE'S 20 BUCKS.

229
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:32,302
I WANT YOU TO CLOSE UP SHOP 
AND GO CRAZY.

230
00:08:32,302 --> 00:08:34,429
GO FIND YOURSELF SOMETHING 
TO BUY THAT YOU DON'T NEED.

231
00:08:34,429 --> 00:08:39,644
- ABSOLUTELY. HERE. 
TAKE 225 FROM ME.

232
00:08:39,644 --> 00:08:42,437
- [singing] BIG YELLOW JOINT 
BIG YELLOW JOINT

233
00:08:42,437 --> 00:08:44,732
I'LL MEET YOU DOWN 
AT THE BIG YELLOW JOINT

234
00:08:48,653 --> 00:08:52,114
narrator: MAEBY WAS WORKING 
WITH HER GRANDMOTHER.

235
00:08:52,114 --> 00:08:54,283
- AND THIS IS FROM

236
00:08:54,283 --> 00:08:57,202
WHEN YOUR POP-POP YELLED OUT, 
"OH, MELANIE,"

237
00:08:57,202 --> 00:08:59,454
WHEN HE WAS MAKING LOVE 
TO GANGY.

238
00:08:59,454 --> 00:09:00,455
- THIS IS SO MUCH FUN.

239
00:09:00,455 --> 00:09:01,624
I CAN'T BELIEVE MY MOM THOUGHT

240
00:09:01,624 --> 00:09:02,958
BEING HERE 
WOULD BE A PUNISHMENT.

241
00:09:02,958 --> 00:09:04,376
- OH, SHE THINKS 
I'M TOO CRITICAL.

242
00:09:04,376 --> 00:09:06,336
THAT'S ANOTHER FAULT OF HERS.

243
00:09:06,336 --> 00:09:08,380
[gasps] 
AH, YES.

244
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:11,300
THE WEEK WE HAD 
THE AU PAIR.

245
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:13,510
YOU KNOW, YOUR MOTHER 
ALWAYS WANTED THIS BROOCH.

246
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:16,263
- REALLY? 
- DO YOU WANT IT?

247
00:09:16,263 --> 00:09:17,264
- I DO NOW.

248
00:09:17,264 --> 00:09:20,434
THAT'LL SHOW HER 
FOR TRYING TO PUNISH ME.

249
00:09:20,434 --> 00:09:22,311
- OH. PRETTY.

250
00:09:22,311 --> 00:09:24,438
IT'LL DISTRACT 
FROM THE FRECKLES.

251
00:09:28,317 --> 00:09:30,110
[seagulls squawking]

252
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:32,029
narrator: GEORGE MICHAEL 
NERVOUSLY APPROACHED

253
00:09:32,029 --> 00:09:35,282
THE FAMILY YACHT 
GOB HAD BEEN STAYING ON.

254
00:09:35,282 --> 00:09:36,283
- UNCLE GOB?

255
00:09:36,283 --> 00:09:37,451
narrator: WHEN HE SAW 
THE YACHT WAS EMPTY,

256
00:09:37,451 --> 00:09:38,452
GEORGE MICHAEL--

257
00:09:38,452 --> 00:09:43,332
AS HE'D BEEN TRAINED TO DO 
SINCE CHILDHOOD--LEFT A NOTE.

258
00:09:43,332 --> 00:09:45,125
BACK AT THE MODEL HOME,

259
00:09:45,125 --> 00:09:48,087
GOB SHOWED MICHAEL THE NOTE 
HE'D FOUND AT THE DOCK.

260
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:50,798
- NO. THIS CAN'T BE 
FROM MY SON.

261
00:09:50,798 --> 00:09:52,382
- WELL, IT IS HIS HANDWRITING.

262
00:09:52,382 --> 00:09:55,302
PLUS HE LEFT ME $200.

263
00:09:55,302 --> 00:09:57,554
$100.

264
00:09:57,554 --> 00:10:00,432
100. I ACCIDENTALLY SAID 200. 
I DON'T KNOW--

265
00:10:00,432 --> 00:10:02,101
- THIS IS IMPOSSIBLE. 
WHY WOULD HE DO THIS?

266
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:04,186
- I KNOW, YOU KNOW. 
I WAS SHOCKED.

267
00:10:04,186 --> 00:10:05,605
I MEAN, REALLY, 
A HUNDRED DOLLARS.

268
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:08,107
YOU CAN'T GET GOOD WEED 
FOR A HUNDRED BUCKS.

269
00:10:08,107 --> 00:10:10,275
- [sighs] 
- ANYWAY, HERE YOU GO.

270
00:10:10,275 --> 00:10:13,278
NOW WE ARE EVEN ON YOU 
PAYING OFF THAT HOT COPS THING.

271
00:10:13,278 --> 00:10:15,197
MIGHT JUST BE A FEW STEMS, 
BUT IT SHOULD BE--

272
00:10:15,197 --> 00:10:17,700
- GET THAT THE HELL 
OUT OF THIS HOUSE.

273
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:18,826
WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU?

274
00:10:18,826 --> 00:10:20,828
- MAYBE YOU SHOULD 
SAVE THE LECTURES FOR YOUR SON,

275
00:10:20,828 --> 00:10:21,829
IF HE CAN REMEMBER THEM.

276
00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:23,205
- MAN, I SPEAK TO LINDSAY 
ONE TIME

277
00:10:23,205 --> 00:10:24,665
ABOUT HER STUPID 
HIPPIE PARENTING,

278
00:10:24,665 --> 00:10:25,666
AND I END UP WITH A HIPPIE.

279
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:27,001
- YEAH, IT DOES SEEM 
PRETTY QUICK.

280
00:10:27,001 --> 00:10:28,961
- FOR ALL I KNOW, THIS HAS 
BEEN GOIN' ON FOREVER.

281
00:10:28,961 --> 00:10:30,129
YOU KNOW, HE'S BEEN STRESSED,

282
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:31,130
HIS EYES HAVE BEEN RED,

283
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:33,132
HIS GRADES ARE DROPPING.

284
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:34,133
- HEARD ABOUT THE A-MINUS.

285
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:37,136
- I'M GONNA GO FIND OUT 
WHAT'S GOING ON.

286
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:39,764
HEY, WHAT YOU DOIN'? 
- NOTHING.

287
00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:44,393
- NO? SO, LISTEN, YOUR, UH, 
YOUR UNCLE GOB

288
00:10:44,393 --> 00:10:47,855
SEEMS TO THINK THAT HE SAW YOU 
DOWN AT THE DOCKS TODAY.

289
00:10:47,855 --> 00:10:48,856
WAS THAT YOU?

290
00:10:48,856 --> 00:10:50,399
- NO, NO.

291
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:52,234
MAYBE IT WAS 
THE OTHER GEORGE MICHAEL,

292
00:10:52,234 --> 00:10:54,111
YOU KNOW THE SINGER-SONGWRITER.

293
00:10:54,111 --> 00:10:56,155
- YEAH, THAT MAKES SENSE. 
- YEAH.

294
00:10:56,155 --> 00:10:59,199
- WHAT'D YOU DO 
WITH THE, UM--

295
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:01,827
WITH THE MONEY BUSTER AND I GAVE 
YOU TO GO HAVE FUN WITH?

296
00:11:01,827 --> 00:11:04,496
- I PUT THAT 
IN MY SAVINGS ACCOUNT.

297
00:11:04,496 --> 00:11:07,082
- IS THAT RIGHT? 
- YEAH. SAVE UP.

298
00:11:07,082 --> 00:11:10,252
- OKAY.

299
00:11:10,252 --> 00:11:11,754
THANKS FOR BEING HONEST. 
- YEAH.

300
00:11:11,754 --> 00:11:14,048
- HE'S LYING TO ME. 
CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT?

301
00:11:14,048 --> 00:11:17,802
WHERE THE HELL 
IS THIS FAMILY'S MORALITY?

302
00:11:17,802 --> 00:11:19,804
- I DON'T KNOW.

303
00:11:19,804 --> 00:11:20,805
- WHAT--

304
00:11:20,805 --> 00:11:22,765
- IT'S COLD OUT HERE. 
[coughs]

305
00:11:22,765 --> 00:11:23,766
- SO WHAT DO I DO NOW?

306
00:11:23,766 --> 00:11:25,267
IF I CONFRONT HIM, HE'S JUST 
GONNA LIE TO ME AGAIN.

307
00:11:25,267 --> 00:11:26,268
SHOULD I YELL AT HIM?

308
00:11:26,268 --> 00:11:30,022
- DIDN'T DAD TEACH US THAT 
WE DON'T YELL IN THIS FAMILY?

309
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:31,023
[kids yelling]

310
00:11:31,023 --> 00:11:33,818
- TELL ME BEFORE 
YOU HIT THE GAS.

311
00:11:33,818 --> 00:11:35,986
[yelling continues] 
- I CAN'T HEAR YOU!

312
00:11:35,986 --> 00:11:37,905
THE KIDS ARE YELLING.

313
00:11:37,905 --> 00:11:41,450
- TELL ME BEFORE 
YOU HIT THE GAS.

314
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:45,788
- I GUESS YOU'RE SAYING, 
"HIT THE GAS."

315
00:11:45,788 --> 00:11:46,789
[engine revs]

316
00:11:46,789 --> 00:11:47,790
- DON'T! WAIT! NO!

317
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:49,792
[screams] 
[kids screaming]

318
00:11:53,796 --> 00:11:57,466
- THAT'S WHY YOU DON'T YELL.

319
00:11:57,466 --> 00:11:59,093
- [laughing]

320
00:11:59,093 --> 00:12:01,636
- YEAH, YELLING'S 
NOT A GOOD WAY TO GO.

321
00:12:01,636 --> 00:12:02,637
I GOT A BETTER IDEA.

322
00:12:02,637 --> 00:12:03,680
[metal door slams]

323
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:06,058
- YOU WANNA TEACH 
GEORGE MICHAEL A LESSON?

324
00:12:06,058 --> 00:12:07,351
- YES, I DO, 
AND IT'S GOTTA STICK.

325
00:12:07,351 --> 00:12:09,937
HE'S GETTING INTO DRUGS, DAD, 
AND HE'S LYING TO ME.

326
00:12:09,937 --> 00:12:11,396
- THAT DOESN'T SOUND 
LIKE THE BOY.

327
00:12:11,396 --> 00:12:12,731
- I KNOW. I KNOW. 
BUT IT'S MY FAULT.

328
00:12:12,731 --> 00:12:14,024
I'VE BEEN PUSHING HIM TOO HARD.

329
00:12:14,024 --> 00:12:15,609
IT'S JUST-- 
DUMB, DUMB. DUMB, MICHAEL.

330
00:12:15,609 --> 00:12:16,443
- HEY, HEY.

331
00:12:16,443 --> 00:12:17,903
- DUMB. 
- SHH, SHH, SHH. I FORGIVE YOU.

332
00:12:17,903 --> 00:12:19,363
- I DON'T WANT 
YOUR FORGIVENESS, DAD.

333
00:12:19,363 --> 00:12:21,490
I WANT THE GUY WITH THE ONE ARM 
AND THE FAKE BLOOD.

334
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:23,408
J. WALTER WEATHERMAN-- 
HOW DO I GET AHOLD OF HIM?

335
00:12:23,408 --> 00:12:24,368
- HE'S, UH, DEAD.

336
00:12:24,368 --> 00:12:25,995
YOU KILLED HIM WHEN 
YOU LEFT THE DOOR OPEN

337
00:12:25,995 --> 00:12:27,329
WITH THE AIR CONDITIONER 
RUNNING.

338
00:12:27,329 --> 00:12:28,789
- FOR GOD'S SAKES, DAD. 
HE'S NOT DEAD.

339
00:12:28,789 --> 00:12:31,333
LISTEN, I NEED TO DO THIS SOON, 
OKAY, LIKE, TONIGHT.

340
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:32,334
DOWN BY THE DOCKS--

341
00:12:32,334 --> 00:12:34,294
I'M GONNA MAKE IT 
LIKE A DRUG DEAL WENT BAD.

342
00:12:34,294 --> 00:12:36,588
TONIGHT? NO. IT'S YONTIF.

343
00:12:36,588 --> 00:12:38,966
IT'S THE FIRST NIGHT 
OF YOM KIPPUR.

344
00:12:38,966 --> 00:12:40,509
- DAD, THAT'S JUST-- 
THAT'S ONE NIGHT,

345
00:12:40,509 --> 00:12:41,551
AND IT'S BACK IN SEPTEMBER.

346
00:12:41,551 --> 00:12:43,595
THAT'S OKAY. YOU'VE ONLY BEEN A 
JEW ABOUT TWO DAYS.

347
00:12:43,595 --> 00:12:45,347
- JUST TRY TO TALK TO HIM.

348
00:12:45,347 --> 00:12:47,182
- LIKE YOU TALKED TO ME 
WHEN I WAS GROWING UP?

349
00:12:47,182 --> 00:12:48,600
- I THOUGHT 
YOU HATED THOSE LESSONS.

350
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,394
- I DID, BUT THEY WORKED.

351
00:12:50,394 --> 00:12:51,395
AND THEY WILL WORK AGAIN.

352
00:12:51,395 --> 00:12:54,398
- WELL, I'M DONE WITH THEM, 
BECAUSE IT WAS WRONG, MICHAEL.

353
00:12:54,398 --> 00:12:55,399
- COME ON.

354
00:12:55,399 --> 00:12:57,359
- YOUR SON IS A TIMID, 
THOUGHTFUL BOY.

355
00:12:57,359 --> 00:13:02,447
HE'S A SCHOLAR, 
LIKE HIS GRANDFATHER.

356
00:13:02,447 --> 00:13:05,367
WHAT TIME IS IT? 
OH, ALMOST SUNDOWN.

357
00:13:05,367 --> 00:13:07,369
I HAVE TO PREPARE 
FOR THE SABBATH.

358
00:13:07,369 --> 00:13:08,370
- IT'S TUESDAY.

359
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:09,955
- SHH, SHH, SHH.

360
00:13:09,955 --> 00:13:11,165
narrator: LINDSAY WENT TO SEE

361
00:13:11,165 --> 00:13:14,209
HOW HER OWN ATTEMPT AT PARENTAL 
DISCIPLINE WAS COMING ALONG.

362
00:13:14,209 --> 00:13:16,503
- SO, HAVING FUN?

363
00:13:16,503 --> 00:13:18,255
WHERE'D YOU GET THAT BROOCH?

364
00:13:18,255 --> 00:13:20,966
- GANGY. NICE, HUH?

365
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:22,217
- THAT WAS SUPPOSED 
TO BE FOR ME.

366
00:13:22,217 --> 00:13:23,718
SHE WAS MY AU PAIR.

367
00:13:23,718 --> 00:13:25,137
I'M THE ONE 
WHO CLEARED MY THROAT

368
00:13:25,137 --> 00:13:26,721
AND POINTED TO THE LAUNDRY ROOM.

369
00:13:26,721 --> 00:13:29,892
MA! YOU KNOW I WANTED THAT.

370
00:13:29,892 --> 00:13:31,894
- I KNOW, 
BUT IT'S AN ELEPHANT,

371
00:13:31,894 --> 00:13:34,479
AND I DIDN'T WANT 
TO INVITE THE COMPARISON.

372
00:13:34,479 --> 00:13:36,731
- NICE.

373
00:13:36,731 --> 00:13:38,275
IN ANY EVENT, 
YOUR PUNISHMENT IS OVER.

374
00:13:38,275 --> 00:13:39,276
COME ON, MAEBY. LET'S GO.

375
00:13:39,276 --> 00:13:42,529
- SHE'S NOT GOING ANYWHERE. 
WE'RE HAVING FUN.

376
00:13:42,529 --> 00:13:43,530
HERE, MAEBY. 
TRY THIS ON.

377
00:13:43,530 --> 00:13:45,908
- I SEE.

378
00:13:45,908 --> 00:13:48,743
FINE. I WAS GONNA 
TAKE HER OUT FOR ICE CREAM,

379
00:13:48,743 --> 00:13:53,415
BUT IF YOU'D RATHER STAY HERE, 
WELL, THAT'S JUST FINE WITH ME.

380
00:13:56,168 --> 00:13:58,212
[door closes]

381
00:13:58,212 --> 00:14:00,422
- WELL, WE COULD GO GET 
SOME ICE CREAM, GANGY.

382
00:14:00,422 --> 00:14:01,423
THAT WOULD BE FUN, RIGHT?

383
00:14:01,423 --> 00:14:03,258
- I DON'T THINK SO.

384
00:14:03,258 --> 00:14:05,260
THAT CHUBBY LITTLE WRIST 
OF YOURS

385
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:08,889
IS TESTING THE TENSILE STRENGTH 
OF THIS BRACELET AS IT IS.

386
00:14:08,889 --> 00:14:09,890
narrator: MAEBY DECIDED

387
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:12,559
THAT PERHAPS SHE'D HAD ENOUGH 
OF HER GRANDMOTHER.

388
00:14:12,559 --> 00:14:14,728
- MAEBY.

389
00:14:14,728 --> 00:14:15,729
MAEBY?

390
00:14:20,192 --> 00:14:21,193
- HEY, GOB. IT'S MICHAEL.

391
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:23,570
LISTEN, I FIGURED OUT A WAY 
FOR YOU TO REPAY THAT FAVOR.

392
00:14:23,570 --> 00:14:25,530
DAD WOULDN'T HELP ME TEACH 
GEORGE MICHAEL THE LESSON,

393
00:14:25,530 --> 00:14:28,075
SO I NEED YOUR HELP 
AND YOUR HOT COP FRIENDS.

394
00:14:28,075 --> 00:14:29,451
I WANNA FAKE A DRUG BUST.

395
00:14:29,451 --> 00:14:32,454
- MICHAEL, THESE GUYS 
ARE REAL DANCERS.

396
00:14:32,454 --> 00:14:36,041
THEY'VE NEVER DONE 
ANY HOT POLICING.

397
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:37,501
- WELL, THEY DON'T 
EVEN NEED TO BE HOT.

398
00:14:37,501 --> 00:14:39,294
THEY JUST NEED TO SHOW UP 
IN THOSE UNIFORMS.

399
00:14:39,294 --> 00:14:42,047
narrator: AND SO MICHAEL'S PLAN 
WAS PUT INTO MOTION.

400
00:14:42,047 --> 00:14:44,841
- WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN? 
- WHAT?

401
00:14:44,841 --> 00:14:46,135
- I AM LIKE 
A CAGED ANIMAL.

402
00:14:50,347 --> 00:14:53,058
MY OLD LADY'S 
ON THE FLOOR, MAN.

403
00:14:53,058 --> 00:14:55,477
I AM NOT S-ING AROUND.

404
00:14:55,477 --> 00:14:56,478
- YEAH. GOB JUST CALLED.

405
00:14:56,478 --> 00:14:58,230
HE'S GOT THE STUFF 
AT THE YACHT.

406
00:14:58,230 --> 00:14:59,231
- OH, GREAT. LET'S GO.

407
00:14:59,231 --> 00:15:01,066
- NO, NO. I THINK MY DAD'S 
ON TO THIS.

408
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:02,067
I'M OUT. I'M NOT--

409
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:03,360
- WHOA, WHOA, WHOA. 
COME ON.

410
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:06,071
GOB WILL NEVER 
GIVE IT TO ME.

411
00:15:06,071 --> 00:15:09,658
MY WOMAN IS SICK. 
PLEASE?

412
00:15:16,373 --> 00:15:17,917
narrator: LATER THAT NIGHT,

413
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:20,002
MICHAEL MADE THE FINAL 
ARRANGEMENTS WITH GOB.

414
00:15:20,002 --> 00:15:22,462
- ALL RIGHT, GOB, IS THIS 
GONNA BE BELIEVABLE?

415
00:15:22,462 --> 00:15:24,548
I WANT HIM SCARED. 
I LOVE THIS KID.

416
00:15:24,548 --> 00:15:25,799
- THESE GUYS ARE PROS, 
MICHAEL.

417
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:27,009
THEY'RE GONNA 
PUSH THE TENSION

418
00:15:27,009 --> 00:15:28,885
TO THE LAST POSSIBLE MOMENT 
BEFORE THEY STRIP.

419
00:15:28,885 --> 00:15:31,305
- THEY'RE NOT GOING 
TO STRIP, ARE THEY?

420
00:15:31,305 --> 00:15:32,306
- I TOLD THEM NOT TO,

421
00:15:32,306 --> 00:15:34,183
BUT I CAN'T PROMISE THAT 
THEIR INSTINCTS WON'T KICK IN.

422
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:35,184
- UNBELIEVABLE.

423
00:15:35,184 --> 00:15:37,019
- ANYWAY, TRUST ME. 
IT'S GONNA BE TOTALLY REAL.

424
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:39,229
THIS KIND OF THING GOES ON 
ALL THE TIME OUT HERE.

425
00:15:39,229 --> 00:15:41,941
BOATS WAIT OFFSHORE, 
LIGHTS ARE FLASHED.

426
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:44,401
A GUY COMES OVER 
AND DROPS OFF A BAG.

427
00:15:44,401 --> 00:15:46,445
IT'S GONNA FREAK 
THE LITTLE BASTARD OUT.

00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:48,488
narrator: 
MICHAEL WENT OFF TO HIDE

429
00:15:48,488 --> 00:15:51,533
WHILE BUSTER AND GEORGE MICHAEL 
ARRIVED AS PLANNED.

430
00:15:51,533 --> 00:15:53,577
- I REALLY APPRECIATE 
YOU DOING THIS FOR ME.

431
00:15:53,577 --> 00:15:57,164
YOU'RE MAKING A VERY 
MISERABLE PERSON HAPPY.

432
00:15:57,164 --> 00:15:59,166
- SHE REALLY FEELS AWFUL, HUH?

433
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:01,376
- OH. OH, I WAS TALKING 
ABOUT ME.

434
00:16:01,376 --> 00:16:05,047
BUT, YEAH, SHE'S A MESS. 
BE CAREFUL.

435
00:16:12,387 --> 00:16:15,599
- UNCLE GOB? 
- GEORGE MICHAEL.

436
00:16:15,599 --> 00:16:16,891
YOU WEREN'T FOLLOWED, 
WERE YOU?

437
00:16:16,891 --> 00:16:19,436
- NO, I DON'T THINK SO.

438
00:16:19,436 --> 00:16:22,314
- ALL RIGHT, KID.

439
00:16:22,314 --> 00:16:24,816
LET'S DEAL SOME DRUGS.

440

[switch clicking]

441
00:16:28,695 --> 00:16:30,405

- FLASHING THE LIGHTS--

443
00:16:32,407 --> 00:16:34,534
SO THE DEALER KNOWS 
WHAT'S GOIN' DOWN.

444
00:16:38,872 --> 00:16:39,873
NOW WE WAIT.

445
00:16:39,873 --> 00:16:42,251
- HOW LONG?

446
00:16:42,251 --> 00:16:44,419
- WHO KNOWS? 
HOUR.

447
00:16:44,419 --> 00:16:45,879
MAYBE FIVE.

448
00:16:45,879 --> 00:16:47,339
- DRUG DELIVERY!

449
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:49,341
YOU WANTED 
SOME MARIJUANA?

450
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:51,593
- NO, NOT ME. 
MY NEPHEW DID.

451
00:16:51,593 --> 00:16:52,594
- [chuckles]

452
00:16:52,594 --> 00:16:54,138
SHOW ME THE MONEY.

453
00:16:58,933 --> 00:16:59,934
- SHOW US THE POT.

454
00:16:59,934 --> 00:17:02,437
- I GOT IT RIGHT HERE.

455
00:17:02,437 --> 00:17:03,438
- OH, MY GOD.

456
00:17:03,438 --> 00:17:05,607
- NICE, RIGHT?

457
00:17:05,607 --> 00:17:07,276
- OKAY, YOU CAN 
PUT YOUR SHIRT DOWN, DEREK.

458
00:17:07,276 --> 00:17:08,277
JUST GIVE HIM THE STUFF.

459
00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:18,037
SO. WE HAVE A DEAL.

460

- WHAT? OH, NO! 
IT'S THE COPS!

464
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:27,003
AND A CONSTRUCTION WORKER.

465
00:17:27,003 --> 00:17:29,131
- LET'S GET THIS PARTY STARTED.

466
00:17:29,131 --> 00:17:30,465
- AREN'T YOU GUYS 
GONNA CUFF HIM?

467
00:17:30,465 --> 00:17:32,134

468
00:17:32,134 --> 00:17:33,302

469
00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:37,139

- THIS IS A LESSON.

478
00:17:48,192 --> 00:17:51,027
AND MAYBE I PUSHED YOU 
INTO THIS,

479
00:17:51,027 --> 00:17:52,028
BUT I LOVE YOU TOO MUCH

480
00:17:52,028 --> 00:17:53,572
TO SEE YOU RUIN YOUR LIFE 
WITH THAT CRAP.

481
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:54,573
- BUT IT WASN'T FOR ME.

482
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:56,408
- THEN WHO WAS IT FOR?

483
00:17:56,408 --> 00:17:58,452
WHO? GIVE ME A NAME.

484
00:18:00,245 --> 00:18:01,246
- OKAY, IT WAS FOR ME.

00:18:01,246 --> 00:18:03,165
- YEAH.

486
00:18:03,165 --> 00:18:05,084

MARIJUANA LIKE A CIGARETTE.

SHE'S SICK.

494
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:22,016

YOU JUST WAIT IT OUT?

00:18:22,016 --> 00:18:23,602
SHE'S GONNA BE GONE SOON. 
[laughing]

00:18:36,615 --> 00:18:38,783
- WELL, YOU'RE ALWAYS TELLING ME 
TO DO THE RIGHT THING--

504
00:18:38,783 --> 00:18:39,743
PUT FAMILY FIRST.

505
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:41,703
- YOU KNOW, IT IS UNBELIEVABLE

506
00:18:41,703 --> 00:18:43,705
THAT YOU'D ASK MY SON 
TO SCORE YOU POT.

507
00:18:43,705 --> 00:18:44,789
WHY DON'T YOU DRIVE HIM HOME,

508
00:18:44,789 --> 00:18:46,375
AND YOU AND I WILL TALK 
ABOUT THIS LATER.

509
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:47,459
GO AHEAD. 
GO WITH BUSTER.

510
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:48,710
- I'M SORRY.

511
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:51,045
- HEY, WHAT ARE YOU GUYS DOIN'?

512
00:18:51,045 --> 00:18:52,839
- WE GOT YOUR SIGNAL. 
YOU FLASHED THE LIGHTS.

513
00:18:52,839 --> 00:18:55,217
- WE GOT THE DRUGS. 
YOU GOT THE MONEY?

514
00:18:55,217 --> 00:18:57,886
- NO, NO. NO, NO, NO, NO. 
WE'RE ALL GOOD.

515
00:18:57,886 --> 00:18:58,887
- WE JUST WANT THE MONEY.

516
00:18:58,887 --> 00:18:59,971
YOU WANNA MAKE THIS UGLY?

517
00:18:59,971 --> 00:19:02,015
- WE WERE JUST TEACHING 
THE YOUNG FELLOW A LESSON.

518
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:03,517
WE DON'T WANT 
ANY TROUBLE WITH YOU.

519
00:19:03,517 --> 00:19:04,518
- THANKS VERY MUCH.

520
00:19:04,518 --> 00:19:06,145

YOU'RE DEALIN' WITH?

521
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:07,146
[siren wails]

522
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:08,147
- DROP THE BOXES!

523
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:09,731
PUT YOUR HANDS IN THE AIR.

524
00:19:09,731 --> 00:19:10,732
- WHAT IS THIS?

525
00:19:10,732 --> 00:19:12,066
- WE HAD NOTHIN' 
TO DO WITH THIS!

526
00:19:12,066 --> 00:19:13,067
- YOU SET US UP!

527
00:19:13,067 --> 00:19:15,404
- NO, NO! 
THESE ARE JUST STRIPPERS!

528
00:19:15,404 --> 00:19:16,405
LOOK HOW HOT THEY ARE!

529
00:19:16,405 --> 00:19:18,198
- EVERYBODY TAKE A BREATH!

530
00:19:18,198 --> 00:19:19,366
[all shouting, indistinct]

531
00:19:19,366 --> 00:19:21,660
[gunshots]

532
00:19:28,124 --> 00:19:31,170
- OH, MY GOD! MY ARM!

533
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:33,505
- OH, MY GOD, 
THIS GUY'S ARM...

534
00:19:35,257 --> 00:19:39,135
JUST CAME OFF 
AND LANDED ON THE DOCK.

535
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:41,846
narrator: MICHAEL REALIZED THAT 
HIS FATHER HAD, ONCE AGAIN,

536
00:19:41,846 --> 00:19:43,973
TAUGHT HIM 
AN ELABORATE LESSON.

537
00:19:43,973 --> 00:19:48,102
- AND THAT'S WHY YOU DON'T 
TEACH LESSONS TO YOUR SON.

538
00:19:48,102 --> 00:19:50,772
- HOW COULD YOU 
DO THAT TO ME?

539
00:19:50,772 --> 00:19:51,773
- I TOLD YOU HE'S A GOOD KID.

540
00:19:51,773 --> 00:19:54,609
YOU SHOULD TRY TALKING TO HIM 
WHEN YOU THINK HE'S IN TROUBLE.

541
00:19:54,609 --> 00:19:55,944
DON'T MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE 
I DID,

542
00:19:55,944 --> 00:19:58,572
YOU KNOW-- 
TEACHING LESSONS.

543
00:19:58,572 --> 00:20:00,532
- SO YOU TAUGHT ME A LESSON 
NOT TO TEACH LESSONS?

544
00:20:00,532 --> 00:20:04,953
- [sighs] 
IT WAS MY LAST LESSON.

545
00:20:04,953 --> 00:20:06,455
narrator: 
BACK AT THE MODEL HOME.

546
00:20:06,455 --> 00:20:08,957
- BACK FROM YOUR WONDERFUL TIME 
WITH GANGY?

547
00:20:08,957 --> 00:20:10,959
- WELL, ACTUALLY, 
IT WASN'T SO WONDERFUL.

548
00:20:10,959 --> 00:20:12,794
SHE CAN BE KINDA NASTY.

549
00:20:12,794 --> 00:20:15,297
BUT I'LL TELL YOU SOMETHIN'.

550
00:20:15,297 --> 00:20:18,675
I'M GLAD YOU'RE MY MOM.

551
00:20:18,675 --> 00:20:21,803
OH, UM, 
I GOT YOU SOMETHING.

552
00:20:21,803 --> 00:20:22,804
- YOU'RE GIVING ME THIS?

553
00:20:22,804 --> 00:20:24,473
- YOU DESERVE IT.

554
00:20:24,473 --> 00:20:26,015
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU HAD 
TO PUT UP WITH HER

555
00:20:26,015 --> 00:20:28,184
YOUR WHOLE LIFE.

556
00:20:28,184 --> 00:20:32,939
- HONEY, THIS IS SO SWEET.

557
00:20:32,939 --> 00:20:35,317
LET'S SELL IT 
AND GO SHOPPING.

558
00:20:35,317 --> 00:20:36,776
- YOU KNEW THE WHOLE TIME, 
DIDN'T YOU?

559
00:20:36,776 --> 00:20:38,987
- KIND OF.

560
00:20:38,987 --> 00:20:40,905
ONE OF THE HOT COPS 
IS MY CHOIR TEACHER.

561
00:20:40,905 --> 00:20:42,407
-  BUDDY, I'M SORRY 
ABOUT ALL THIS.

562
00:20:42,407 --> 00:20:44,451
IT'S JUST, YOU KNOW, YOU WERE 
SO STRESSED OUT,

563
00:20:44,451 --> 00:20:48,037
AND I GUESS 
I GOT SCARED AND--

564
00:20:48,037 --> 00:20:50,540
I SHOULD PROBABLY LEARN TO TALK 
WITH YOU A LITTLE BIT MORE, HUH?

565
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:52,376
- WELL, I THINK WE'RE OKAY. 
- WE ARE, AREN'T WE?

566
00:20:52,376 --> 00:20:53,877
I MEAN, 
YOU KNOW THAT THERE'S NOTHING

567
00:20:53,877 --> 00:20:55,837
THAT YOU CAN'T BE TOTALLY HONEST 
WITH ME ABOUT.

568
00:20:55,837 --> 00:20:58,882
I MEAN, YOU CAN SAY ANYTHING TO 
ME, YOU KNOW, ANYTHING AT ALL.

569
00:20:58,882 --> 00:21:02,552
- LIKE, SAY, I HAD A CRUSH 
ON MY OWN COUSIN.

570
00:21:07,474 --> 00:21:09,684
- HEY. 
[snorts]

571
00:21:09,684 --> 00:21:11,895
YOU JUST TAUGHT ME 
A LESSON.

572
00:21:11,895 --> 00:21:14,356
- [singing] BIG YELLOW JOINT 
THE BIG YELLOW JOINT

573
00:21:14,356 --> 00:21:15,524

574
00:21:15,524 --> 00:21:17,776
