00:00:01,209 --> 00:00:02,502
narrator: NOW THE STORY 
OF A WEALTHY FAMILY

2
00:00:02,502 --> 00:00:03,753
WHO LOST EVERYTHING...

3
00:00:03,753 --> 00:00:05,380
AND THE ONE SON 
WHO HAD NO CHOICE...

4
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:13,304
BUT TO KEEP THEM ALL TOGETHER.

5
00:00:13,304 --> 00:00:18,309
IT'S ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT.

6
00:00:18,309 --> 00:00:19,310
MICHAEL WAS MEETING

7
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:21,521
WITH THE COMPANY'S ACCOUNTANT, 
IRA GILLIGAN.

8
00:00:21,521 --> 00:00:23,648
- ANYWAY, I HAVE GONE OVER THIS 
10 DIFFERENT WAYS,

9
00:00:23,648 --> 00:00:25,608
AND YOU'RE REPORTING INCOME 
ON AN ACCOUNT THAT--

10
00:00:25,608 --> 00:00:27,443
YOU KNOW, 
IT IS JUST FREEZING IN HERE.

11
00:00:27,443 --> 00:00:29,487
- WELL, THE THERMOSTAT 
IS IN MY OFFICE.

12
00:00:29,487 --> 00:00:30,738
WHILE IT'S FREEZING IN HERE,

13
00:00:30,738 --> 00:00:32,448
IT'S STILL HOT IN THERE. 
SO PLEASE CONTINUE.

14
00:00:32,448 --> 00:00:34,242
- THERE'S BASICALLY NO MONEY 
WHERE IT SHOULD BE.

15
00:00:34,242 --> 00:00:35,951
I THINK I'M CATCHING A COLD.

16
00:00:35,951 --> 00:00:37,328
- YOU'RE NOT 
CATCHING A COLD.

17
00:00:37,328 --> 00:00:39,997
- I KNOW MY BODY.

18
00:00:39,997 --> 00:00:41,457
- SO THERE'S NO MONEY IN THE 
ACCOUNT?

19
00:00:41,457 --> 00:00:42,500
- I'M SORRY.

20
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:43,751
THIS IS LIKE 
THE BAYOU IN HERE.

21
00:00:43,751 --> 00:00:45,628
- I TRIED TO TELL YOU THAT.

22
00:00:45,628 --> 00:00:48,548
- WELL I GUESS I JUST HAD 
TO FIND OUT FOR MYSELF.

23
00:00:48,548 --> 00:00:50,175
ANYWAY, THIS ISN'T THE FIRST 
DISCREPANCY

24
00:00:50,175 --> 00:00:52,385
WITH YOUR FATHER'S BOOKS.

25
00:00:52,385 --> 00:00:54,720
AND WITH THIS COURT CASE COMING 
UP, I JUST HAVE TO WARN YOU...

26
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:56,889
IF THEY ASK ME TO TESTIFY, 
I AM NOT GONNA LIE.

27
00:00:56,889 --> 00:00:58,141
- NO ONE'S ASKING YOU 
TO LIE.

28
00:00:58,141 --> 00:00:59,309
- WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

29
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:01,061
YOU'RE ASKING GILLIGAN 
NOT TO LIE?

30
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:03,729
PLEASE CALL ME IRA. 
I DON'T LIKE GILLIGAN.

31
00:01:03,729 --> 00:01:05,815
- WHO DOESN'T LIKE GILLIGAN?

32
00:01:05,815 --> 00:01:08,609
IS IT COLD IN HERE?

33
00:01:08,609 --> 00:01:10,486
- SO, LISTEN. YOU HAVE BEEN 
MARRIED TWO WEEKS NOW.

34
00:01:10,486 --> 00:01:11,696
IT SEEMS TO BE STICKING.

35
00:01:11,696 --> 00:01:13,156
AND LET'S PRETEND 
IT'S A GOOD THING.

36
00:01:13,156 --> 00:01:15,283
I GUESS THIS MAKES ME 
YOUR BEST MAN,

37
00:01:15,283 --> 00:01:19,120
AND I WOULD LIKE TO THROW YOU 
A BACHELOR PARTY.

38
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:21,581
- YEAH, I DON'T THINK 
SHE'D GO FOR THAT.

39
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:22,832
BESIDES, I TALKED TO DAD.

40
00:01:22,832 --> 00:01:24,959
HE SAID IT WAS STUPID TO GET 
MARRIED IN THE FIRST PLACE.

41
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:28,379
AND HE'S RIGHT. HE'S RIGHT. 
I'VE GOTTA GET RID OF HER.

42
00:01:28,379 --> 00:01:29,672
- YOU KNOW, I--I SAID 
TWO WEEKS AGO

43
00:01:29,672 --> 00:01:31,924
THAT I THOUGHT 
IT WAS A STUPID IDEA.

44
00:01:31,924 --> 00:01:33,718
SUDDENLY DAD SAYS IT 
AND IT'S GOOD ADVICE?

45
00:01:33,718 --> 00:01:35,928
YOU KNOW YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO 
EVERYTHING DAD SAYS.

46
00:01:35,928 --> 00:01:37,180
- I DON'T DO EVERYTHING DAD 
SAYS.

47
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:38,473
HE JUST HAPPENS TO BE RIGHT 
ABOUT THIS.

48
00:01:38,473 --> 00:01:41,142
YOU CAN HELP ME 
GET RID OF HER THOUGH.

49
00:01:41,142 --> 00:01:43,018
MOM'S HAVING A COCKTAIL PARTY. 
SHE'LL BE THERE.

50
00:01:43,018 --> 00:01:44,229
MAYBE YOU CAN 
TRY TO BREAK US UP.

51
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:45,271
- I CAN'T DO THAT.

52
00:01:45,271 --> 00:01:46,564
- WHY NOT? YOU DID IT 
WITH ME AND MARTA.

53
00:01:46,564 --> 00:01:47,815
YOU HAD NO PROBLEM 
WITH THAT, GUY.

54
00:01:47,815 --> 00:01:49,066
YOU KNOW WHAT? LIE TO HER.

55
00:01:49,066 --> 00:01:51,944
TELL HER THAT I'M INSENSITIVE 
AND UNRELIABLE.

56
00:01:51,944 --> 00:01:53,988
- MAYBE SOMETHING ABOUT HOW YOU 
CAN NEVER CONFRONT PEOPLE.

57
00:01:53,988 --> 00:01:55,698
AND YOU NEED 
SOMEONE TO CLEAN UP YOUR MESSES.

58
00:01:55,698 --> 00:01:56,949
- SEE, THAT'S GREAT.

59
00:01:56,949 --> 00:01:58,201
AND THAT'S JUST 
OFF THE TOP OF YOUR HEAD.

60
00:01:58,201 --> 00:02:00,536
- MICHAEL, GOB. I WAS JUST 
IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD.

61
00:02:00,536 --> 00:02:04,290
GOOD LORD. 
IT IS SWELTERING IN HERE.

62
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:06,959
AS YOU MAY 
OR MAY NOT KNOW,

63
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:09,587
LINDSAY AND I HAVE HIT 
A BIT OF A ROUGH PATCH.

64
00:02:09,587 --> 00:02:11,506
- REALLY? 
WHEN DID THAT START?

65
00:02:11,506 --> 00:02:16,136
- WELL, I DON'T WANT 
TO BLAME IT ALL ON 9/11,

66
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:17,970
BUT IT CERTAINLY 
DIDN'T HELP.

67
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:20,265
BUT ANYWAY, I NEED YOUR HELP. 
IF YOU COULD POSSIBLY--

68
00:02:20,265 --> 00:02:22,308
COULD WE GO BACK 
TO YOUR OFFICE, PLEASE?

69
00:02:22,308 --> 00:02:25,186
I JUST WANT TO BE 
A FAMILY AGAIN.

70
00:02:25,186 --> 00:02:29,440
I GUESS WHAT I'M SAYING IS 
I WANT TO REUNITE THE BAND.

71
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,691
- OH, NO.

72
00:02:30,691 --> 00:02:32,152
narrator: 
"OH, NO" WAS RIGHT.

73
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:34,028
IN THE MID '90S, TOBIAS FORMED 
A FOLK MUSIC GROUP

74
00:02:34,028 --> 00:02:36,156
WITH LINDSAY AND MAEBY,

75
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:40,993
CALLED DR. FUNKE'S 100% NATURAL 
GOOD-TIME FAMILY-BAND SOLUTION.

76
00:02:40,993 --> 00:02:43,538
THE GROUP WAS UNDERWRITTEN BY 
THE NATURAL LIFE FOOD COMPANY,

77
00:02:43,538 --> 00:02:44,789
A DIVISION OF CHEM GROW,

78
00:02:44,789 --> 00:02:47,500
AN ALLYN-CRANE ACQUISITION, 
AND PART OF THE SQUIMM GROUP.

79
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:51,086
THEIR MOTTO WAS SIMPLE. 
"WE KEEP YOU ALIVE."

80
00:02:51,086 --> 00:02:52,755
- [singing] KIND OF LIFE THAT IS 
EVEN JUST A LITTLE BIT

81
00:02:52,755 --> 00:02:54,799
BETTER WITH A ZANOTAB

82
00:02:54,799 --> 00:02:56,842
- ZANOTAB MAY CAUSE DRY MOUTH, 
HAIR LOSS,

83
00:02:56,842 --> 00:02:58,093
AN OVERLY ALERT FEELING,

84
00:02:58,093 --> 00:03:00,513
AND IN SOME CASES MAY 
DIMINISH YOUR SEX DRIVE.

85
00:03:00,513 --> 00:03:03,098
- [singing] ZANOTAB

86
00:03:03,098 --> 00:03:05,059
- WELL, THERE'S A WELLNESS 
CONVENTION IN TOWN,

87
00:03:05,059 --> 00:03:06,686
AND I THOUGHT MAYBE YOU COULD 
TALK LINDSAY

88
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:08,187
INTO JOINING ME UP ONSTAGE.

89
00:03:08,187 --> 00:03:09,855
- YEAH. 
WHY DON'T YOU ASK HER?

90
00:03:09,855 --> 00:03:12,942
- OH, I WOULD, BUT SHE JUST 
DOESN'T TAKE ME SERIOUSLY.

91
00:03:14,402 --> 00:03:16,111
narrator: AND MICHAEL TRIED TO 
FIND THE MONEY

92
00:03:16,111 --> 00:03:17,697
THE ACCOUNTANT SAID WAS MISSING.

93
00:03:17,697 --> 00:03:19,990
- I DON'T KNOW. 
I PROBABLY STOLE IT.

94
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:22,368
I MEAN, IF HE SAYS 
IT'S MISSING, IT IS.

95
00:03:22,368 --> 00:03:25,079
UNLESS HE STOLE IT. 
HEY, MAYBE HE STOLE IT.

96
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:26,497
- HE'S THE ONE 
THAT SAID IT'S MISSING.

97
00:03:26,497 --> 00:03:28,416
- YEAH, I PROBABLY STOLE IT.

98
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:29,667
- WELL, WE NEED TO FIND IT

99
00:03:29,667 --> 00:03:31,210
BEFORE IRA IS ASKED 
TO TESTIFY.

100
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:32,878
- I THOUGHT WE WERE TALKING 
ABOUT GILLIGAN. WHO'S IRA?

101
00:03:32,878 --> 00:03:34,505
- IRA GILLIGAN. 
IRA'S HIS FIRST NAME.

102
00:03:34,505 --> 00:03:35,756
HE ACTUALLY HATES 
TO BE CALLED GILLIGAN.

103
00:03:35,756 --> 00:03:38,050
- WELL, 
HE NEVER TOLD ME THAT.

104
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:39,302
GILLIGAN HAS PROMISED ME

105
00:03:39,302 --> 00:03:41,554
THAT ALL THIS MONEY WILL BE 
SAVED IN I.R.A.S.

106
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:44,640
- IT'S IRA, SIR. 
- OH, I'M SORRY, GILLIGAN.

107
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:47,643
WILL BE SAVED IN "IRAS."

108
00:03:47,643 --> 00:03:48,936
WHAT THE HELL IS THIS, 
GILLIGAN?

109
00:03:48,936 --> 00:03:50,020
- IT'S IRA, SIR.

110
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:52,315
PLEASE CALL ME-- 
- GILLIGAN!

111
00:03:52,315 --> 00:03:54,525
MICHAEL, IF HE TESTIFIES, 
I AM SCREWED.

112
00:03:54,525 --> 00:03:55,776
HERE'S WHAT YOU DO.

113
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:58,488
YOU TAKE HIM OUT 
FOR SOME FISHING OR SOMETHING.

114
00:03:58,488 --> 00:04:00,948
- WHY WOULD I TAKE HIM FISHING? 
- FUN. GUY FUN.

115
00:04:00,948 --> 00:04:02,199
LET'S GET HIM ON OUR SIDE.

116
00:04:02,199 --> 00:04:03,784
- NO. LOOK. 
I'M NOT TAKING HIM FISHING.

117
00:04:03,784 --> 00:04:05,160
- OH, THAT'S RIGHT. 
YOU HATED FISHING.

118
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,412
- NO, I DIDN'T.

119
00:04:06,412 --> 00:04:07,830
- NO, I'LL GET GOB. 
YEAH. HE LIKED IT.

120
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:10,040
- HANG ON A SECOND. 
- HE'S THE ONE WHO'S FUN.

121
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,501
- I LIKED FISHING. 
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

122
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:12,918
I'M FUN.

123
00:04:12,918 --> 00:04:14,962
IT'S JUST THAT-- 
LISTEN.

124
00:04:14,962 --> 00:04:16,797
THE WAY TO FIX THIS IRA THING IS 
NOT TO BUY HIM OFF.

125
00:04:16,797 --> 00:04:18,007
ALL RIGHT?

126
00:04:18,007 --> 00:04:19,467
IT'S TO FIND OUT 
WHERE THE MONEY WENT.

127
00:04:19,467 --> 00:04:21,594
- YOU'RE NO FUN.

128
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:23,638

I'M PLENTY FUN.

GATHERED AT LUCILLE'S...

TO WELCOME GOB'S WIFE.

131
00:04:30,645 --> 00:04:31,979
- I HAVE ALWAYS WANTED 
A DAUGHTER.

132
00:04:31,979 --> 00:04:34,023
- [gasps]

133
00:04:34,023 --> 00:04:36,191
- AND A BLONDE. 
WHAT FUN.

134
00:04:36,191 --> 00:04:37,735
- WHERE DID ANNYONG 
GET THAT JUICE BOX?

135
00:04:37,735 --> 00:04:39,362
- ANNOYONG.

136
00:04:39,362 --> 00:04:40,905
- THOSE ARE FOR HIS SOCCER TEAM.

137
00:04:40,905 --> 00:04:42,865
NO SUGAR FOR YOU. 
YOU JUST GET MORE AWFUL.

138
00:04:45,993 --> 00:04:48,203
- HEY, ADOPTED BROTHER.

139
00:04:48,203 --> 00:04:50,373
DO YOU THINK I COULD HAVE A HIT 
OF THAT JUICE BOX? THAT--

140
00:04:50,373 --> 00:04:52,500
[sucking air]

CONVINCE LINDSAY TO REJOIN...

142

DR. FUNKE'S 100% NATURAL 
GOOD TIME FAMILY BAND SOLUTION.

143
00:05:05,596 --> 00:05:08,849
- DR. FUNKE'S 100% NATURAL 
GOOD TIME FAMILY BAND SOLUTION

144
00:05:08,849 --> 00:05:10,059
WAS A NIGHTMARE FOR ME.

145
00:05:10,059 --> 00:05:11,686
- HMM. 
WELL, HE SAID IT WAS

146
00:05:11,686 --> 00:05:13,688
THE MOST FUN YOUR FAMILY'S 
EVER HAD.

147
00:05:13,688 --> 00:05:16,649
- YEAH, WELL, I WAS WACKED ON 
ZANOTAB THE ENTIRE TIME.

148
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:17,900
- I THOUGHT ZANOTAB

149
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:19,026
WAS SUPPOSED TO MAKE 
EVERYTHING A LITTLE BIT BETTER.

150
00:05:19,026 --> 00:05:20,277
- FOR 15 MINUTES.

151
00:05:20,277 --> 00:05:23,030
THEN IT BURNS WHEN YOU PEE, 
AND YOUR MARRIAGE GOES TO HELL.

152
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:24,281
IT IS NOT A GOOD SUPPLEMENT.

153
00:05:24,281 --> 00:05:26,742
BESIDES, MAEBY'S NOT GONNA WANT 
TO DO IT.

154
00:05:26,742 --> 00:05:29,370
- I WANNA DO IT! 
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

155
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:31,497
THOSE WERE 
OUR BEST TIMES EVER.

156
00:05:31,497 --> 00:05:35,042
- THIS PARTY JUST KEEPS 
GETTIN' BETTER.

157
00:05:35,042 --> 00:05:36,836
- SO, UH-- YOU KNOW, 
IF YOU WANT ME ON WOOD BLOCK,

158
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:38,713
I CAN KEEP PERFECT TIME.

159
00:05:38,713 --> 00:05:41,090
SOME CALL ME 
THE HUMAN METRONOME.

160
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:42,383
YOU NOTICE HOW I'M ALWAYS ON 
TIME?

161
00:05:42,383 --> 00:05:43,884
I'M NEVER LATE FOR THINGS.

162
00:05:43,884 --> 00:05:45,135
- YEAH, BUT I THINK PUNCTUALITY

163
00:05:45,135 --> 00:05:46,596
IS SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT FROM 
RHYTHM.

164
00:05:46,596 --> 00:05:48,180
- NO, IT'S NOT. 
NO, IT'S THE EXACT SAME THING.

165
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:50,475
IT'S KNOWING 
HOW LONG THINGS TAKE.

166
00:05:50,475 --> 00:05:52,685
- LOOK. I'M JUST DOING THIS 
BECAUSE IF MY PARENTS SPLIT UP,

167
00:05:52,685 --> 00:05:55,104
IT'S A LOT MORE WORK FOR ME.

168
00:05:55,104 --> 00:05:57,940
I KNOW. 
THEY SPLIT UP ONCE IN BOSTON.

169
00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:00,735
WHEN THEY GET ALONG, 
I GET TONS MORE ALONE TIME.

170
00:06:00,735 --> 00:06:01,986
WHEN THEY DON'T,

171
00:06:01,986 --> 00:06:03,070
GUESS WHO THEY START SPENDING 
ALL THEIR TIME WITH.

172
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:04,363
ME.

173
00:06:04,363 --> 00:06:06,532
- WE'VE BEEN TALKING HERE FOR 
28 SECONDS. JUST SO YOU KNOW.

174
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:11,829
- EXCUSE ME. 
DR. "FUNKY?"

175
00:06:11,829 --> 00:06:13,080
- AH, FUNKE

176
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:16,834
- OF DR. FUNKE'S 100% NATURAL 
GOOD TIME FAMILY BAND SOLUTION?

177
00:06:16,834 --> 00:06:18,085
- YES!

178
00:06:18,085 --> 00:06:19,670
- OH, MY-- 
I SAW YOU IN '96.

179
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:20,921
- OH!

180
00:06:20,921 --> 00:06:23,257
- YOU SANG A SONG ABOUT 
A SUPPLEMENT CALLED TEAMOCIL?

181
00:06:23,257 --> 00:06:24,258
- TEAMOCIL.

182
00:06:24,258 --> 00:06:25,300
- I MEAN, 
YOU JUST NAILED ME!

183
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:26,719
IT WAS LIKE YOU KNEW 
EVERY SIDE EFFECT I WAS

184
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:28,429
GOING THROUGH AT THAT TIME.

185
00:06:28,429 --> 00:06:30,848
- [singing] THERE'S NO "I" IN 
TEAMOCIL

186
00:06:30,848 --> 00:06:34,519
AT LEAST NOT WHERE 
YOU'D THINK

187
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:36,145
- SADLY, TEAMOCIL HAS BEEN 
DISCONTINUED.

188
00:06:36,145 --> 00:06:37,146
- OH.

189
00:06:37,146 --> 00:06:39,482
- THE SENSE OF WELLNESS 
IT CREATED IN RELATIONSHIPS...

190
00:06:39,482 --> 00:06:42,985
WAS MERELY THE FIRST SIGN OF 
COMPLETE PITUITARY SHUTDOWN.

191
00:06:42,985 --> 00:06:44,612
- EXCUSE ME? ARE YOU, UH-- 
HI. I'M MICHAEL.

192
00:06:44,612 --> 00:06:46,280
- HI. 
- I'M GOB'S BROTHER.

193
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:48,032
- YES. HE TOLD ME 
ALL ABOUT YOU.

194
00:06:48,032 --> 00:06:49,283
YOU HAVE A TERRIFIC VOICE.

195
00:06:49,283 --> 00:06:51,243
- I SMELL OLIVES!

196
00:06:51,243 --> 00:06:53,370
narrator: AND MICHAEL, 
AS PER GOB'S REQUEST,

197
00:06:53,370 --> 00:06:56,415
TRIED TO CONVINCE HIS WIFE 
THAT GOB WAS UNRELIABLE.

198
00:06:56,415 --> 00:06:58,751
- SO, GOB IS LATE. BUT I GUESS 
THAT'S WHO YOU MARRIED.

199
00:06:58,751 --> 00:07:01,712
HE'S PROBABLY OUT TRYING TO DO 
SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT.

200
00:07:01,712 --> 00:07:08,469
- ARE YOU HITTING ON ME? 
GOB SAID THAT WOULD HAPPEN.

201
00:07:08,469 --> 00:07:10,805
[door opens, 
closes]

202
00:07:10,805 --> 00:07:12,056
- HEY, GOB.

203
00:07:12,056 --> 00:07:13,599
IT'S A GOOD THING YOU'RE NOT 
STAYING MARRIED TO THIS GIRL.

204
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:14,850
YOU'VE GOT HER HATING ME--

205
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:18,020
AT LEAST YOUR VERSION OF ME, 
WHICH IS ACTUALLY YOU.

206
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:19,271
- WELL, I TALKED TO DAD,

207
00:07:19,271 --> 00:07:23,526
AND HE THINKS THAT I SHOULD 
STAY IN IT.

208
00:07:23,526 --> 00:07:24,777
- STAY IN THE MARRIAGE?

209
00:07:24,777 --> 00:07:26,028
OH, COME ON, 
YOU'RE NOT LETTING DAD

210
00:07:26,028 --> 00:07:27,404
LEAD YOU AROUND BY THE NOSE 
AGAIN, ARE YOU?

211
00:07:27,404 --> 00:07:28,656
- THINK ABOUT IT.

212
00:07:28,656 --> 00:07:31,659
I'VE GOT THE MARRIAGE AND NONE 
OF THE GOOD PARTS.

213
00:07:31,659 --> 00:07:34,620
IT'S LIKE, SO FAR IT'S BEEN 
ALL CHAIN AND NO BALL.

214
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:35,871
- SURE.

215
00:07:35,871 --> 00:07:37,247
- SO, WE'LL HAVE A CEREMONY 
AND A BACHELOR PARTY.

216
00:07:37,247 --> 00:07:38,624
- A BACHELOR PARTY? 
YOU WANT ONE NOW?

217
00:07:38,624 --> 00:07:40,292
COME ON.

218
00:07:40,292 --> 00:07:42,336
YOU'RE NOT GIVING YOUR BEST MAN 
A WHOLE LOT OF PREP TIME.

219
00:07:42,336 --> 00:07:44,547
- DAD CAN HANDLE IT.

220
00:07:44,547 --> 00:07:45,798
- DAD?

221
00:07:45,798 --> 00:07:48,217
- YEAH. YOU KNOW.

222
00:07:48,217 --> 00:07:50,385
HE'S A FUN GUY, AND...

223
00:07:50,385 --> 00:07:51,637
I'M MAKING HIM MY BEST MAN.

224
00:07:51,637 --> 00:07:53,889
- YOU'RE MAKING DAD 
YOUR BEST MAN. THAT'S GREAT.

225
00:07:53,889 --> 00:07:55,850
I GUESS 
BEING YOUR BROTHER...

226
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:57,309
AND SOLVING ALL YOUR PROBLEMS 
FOR YOU

227
00:07:57,309 --> 00:07:58,561
DOESN'T QUALIFY ME 
AS YOUR BEST MAN.

228
00:07:58,561 --> 00:07:59,812
- HEY. 
IF HE WANTS TO SUPPORT ME,

229
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:02,732
I'M NOT GONNA TELL HIM 
TO GO TO HELL.

230
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:03,983
DON'T WORRY. 
YOU'RE STILL--

231
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:06,026
- WHAT? 
INVITED?

232
00:08:06,026 --> 00:08:07,277
- NO, I WAS GONNA SAY

233
00:08:07,277 --> 00:08:09,572
YOU'RE STILL THE GUY I WANT 
SOLVING MY PROBLEMS, BUT, YEAH--

234
00:08:09,572 --> 00:08:13,367
LET ME TALK TO DAD 
ABOUT THAT INVITE SITUATION.

235
00:08:20,124 --> 00:08:22,459
narrator: THE NEXT DAY, 
GOB VISITED HIS FATHER...

236
00:08:22,459 --> 00:08:24,461
TO PREPARE 
FOR HIS BACHELOR PARTY.

237
00:08:24,461 --> 00:08:26,631
- YOU KNOW, I REALLY THINK THAT 
YOU'RE GONNA LIKE THIS WOMAN.

238
00:08:26,631 --> 00:08:27,882
- WELL, SHE'S COSTING ME ENOUGH,

239
00:08:27,882 --> 00:08:30,092
BUT SHE'S--OH, SHE'S 
A HELL OF A STRIPPER.

240
00:08:30,092 --> 00:08:31,343
- NO, I MEAN MY WIFE.

241
00:08:31,343 --> 00:08:32,427
- OH.

242
00:08:32,427 --> 00:08:34,514
WELL, I--I DOUBT THAT 
VERY MUCH.

243
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:38,058
- WELL, I CAN TELL YOU THAT 
MICHAEL WAS PRETTY UPSET

244
00:08:38,058 --> 00:08:39,852
THAT YOU WANTED TO BE BEST MAN.

245
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:41,103
- DON'T WORRY ABOUT MICHAEL.

246
00:08:41,103 --> 00:08:44,064
- YEAH, MY BACHELOR PARTY'S 
ABOUT HAVING FUN, RIGHT?

247
00:08:44,064 --> 00:08:46,316
- NO, NO. YOUR BACHELOR PARTY'S 
ABOUT CONVINCING GILLIGAN

248
00:08:46,316 --> 00:08:47,902
THAT HE'S KILLED A STRIPPER,

249
00:08:47,902 --> 00:08:50,029
GETTING HIM OUT OF TOWN 
SO HE CAN'T TESTIFY...

250
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:52,406
AND MAKING SURE THAT PEOPLE 
THINK THAT HE TOOK THE MONEY.

251
00:08:52,406 --> 00:08:53,658
- IT IS?

252
00:08:53,658 --> 00:08:54,700
- YEAH.

253
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:56,285
THIS ACCOUNTANT CAN DO US 
A LOT OF DAMAGE.

254
00:08:56,285 --> 00:08:58,245
I WANT HIM NEUTRALIZED. 
DO YOU HEAR ME?

255
00:08:58,245 --> 00:08:59,955
THAT'S WHY I WANT YOU TO USE 
THIS STRIPPER--

256
00:08:59,955 --> 00:09:02,917
A NARCOLEPTIC, 
BELIEVE IT OR NOT.

257
00:09:02,917 --> 00:09:04,251
A FRIEND OF MINE 
AT THE YACHT CLUB,

258
00:09:04,251 --> 00:09:06,962
HE USED HER 
FOR HIS BACHELOR PARTY.

259
00:09:06,962 --> 00:09:11,634
- WE WANTED YOU 
TO HAVE THE FIRST PIECE!

260
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:12,885
[snoring]

261
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:14,595
[men laughing]

262
00:09:14,595 --> 00:09:17,181
YOU PUT HER IN A DARKENED SPACE, 
SHE'S OUT.

263
00:09:17,181 --> 00:09:19,099
YOU GET HIM DRUNK. 
HE PASSES OUT.

264
00:09:19,099 --> 00:09:20,726
THEN YOU COVER THE FLOOR 
WITH CORN SYRUP,

265
00:09:20,726 --> 00:09:23,520
MIXED 
WITH A LITTLE RED DYE.

266
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:24,772
HE COMES TO.

267
00:09:24,772 --> 00:09:26,523
"EEE! BLOOD! AAAH!" 
HE FREAKS OUT.

268
00:09:26,523 --> 00:09:27,733
- OKAY. 
BUT HOW DO YOU KNOW

269
00:09:27,733 --> 00:09:29,151
THAT HE'S GONNA LEAVE 
THE COUNTRY?

270
00:09:29,151 --> 00:09:30,945
- THAT'S WHY I GOT YOU 
THOSE HONEYMOON TICKETS.

271
00:09:30,945 --> 00:09:32,613
YOU NEVER THANKED ME FOR THOSE.

272
00:09:32,613 --> 00:09:34,657
- [stammering] I'M SORRY. 
I MEANT TO. I WAS GONNA--

273
00:09:34,657 --> 00:09:37,451
- YOU JUST HAVE TO CONVINCE HIM 
THAT THIS HAPPENED.

274
00:09:37,451 --> 00:09:38,703
- THAT HE KILLED A STRIPPER?

275
00:09:38,703 --> 00:09:40,412
- CAN YOU DO THIS?

276
00:09:40,412 --> 00:09:41,664
CAN I TRUST YOU?

277
00:09:41,664 --> 00:09:42,707
YOU'RE NOT GONNA GO ALL MICHAEL 
ON ME, ARE YA?

278
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:44,667
- NOBODY'S TURNING 
ALL MICHAEL ON YOU.

279
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:46,877
BUT WHEN YOU GET OUT, THEN WE'RE 
GONNA HAVE A REAL PARTY.

280
00:09:46,877 --> 00:09:48,212
RIGHT, DAD?

281
00:09:48,212 --> 00:09:49,755
- ARE YOU KIDDING? 
WHEN I GET OUT OF HERE,

282
00:09:49,755 --> 00:09:51,006
YOU'RE GONNA THROW ME THE

283
00:09:51,006 --> 00:09:53,383
BIGGEST PARTY THIS TOWN'S EVER 
SEEN, ALL RIGHT?

284
00:09:54,635 --> 00:09:56,095
narrator: 
BACK AT THE MODEL HOME--

285
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:58,097
- [singing] ALL JUST A LITTLE 
BIT BETTER WITH EUPHORAZINE

286
00:09:58,097 --> 00:09:59,098
- ZANOTAB!

287
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:01,976
- STOP! 
IT IS NOT ZANOTAB.

288
00:10:01,976 --> 00:10:03,769
- WELL, MAYBE IF I WAS 
ALLOWED TO HAVE A ZANOTAB,

289
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:04,854
I'D REMEMBER IT'S EUPHORAZINE.

290
00:10:04,854 --> 00:10:06,271
- NO. WE ARE NOT GOING TO DO 
THAT AGAIN.

291
00:10:06,271 --> 00:10:08,440
THIS FAMILY 
IS NOT ABOUT TO START USING.

292
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:10,860
WE ARE PUSHERS, 
NOT TAKERS.

293
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:12,194
OKAY. ONCE MORE, 
FROM THE BRIDGE.

294
00:10:12,194 --> 00:10:15,114
[scoffs]

295
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:17,074
- [singing] BECAUSE I HAVE A 
BROTHER AND A MOTHER AND A LOVER

296
00:10:17,074 --> 00:10:20,661
AND A WIFE AND A DAUGHTER 
- WHAT IS THAT NOISE?

297
00:10:20,661 --> 00:10:23,330
WE DON'T NEED 
THE WOOD BLOCK.

298
00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:26,166
- NO, I JUST THOUGHT I WOULD 
JOIN IN ON THE FUN.

299
00:10:26,166 --> 00:10:27,835
I MEAN, YOU GUYS ARE ALWAYS 
TALKING ABOUT,

300
00:10:27,835 --> 00:10:29,461
YOU KNOW, 
FAMILY AND LOVING AND...

301
00:10:29,461 --> 00:10:31,171
HAVING GOOD TIMES 
IN THE CIRCLE--

302
00:10:31,171 --> 00:10:33,173
- YOU KNOW WHAT? 
THIS ISN'T WORKING.

303
00:10:33,173 --> 00:10:35,843
MAYBE I'M JUST GONNA GO OFF 
AND REHEARSE WITH MAEBY ALONE.

304
00:10:35,843 --> 00:10:36,886
- OH, FINE.

305
00:10:36,886 --> 00:10:39,346
THEN I'LL REHEARSE 
WITH MAEBY AFTER DINNER.

306
00:10:39,346 --> 00:10:42,683
- NO! THIS IS WHOLESOME, 
FAMILY FUN, OKAY?

307
00:10:42,683 --> 00:10:45,560
LET'S TAKE IT FROM LOOSE STOOL! 
ONE, TWO AND A--

308
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:47,521
- WHAT IS THAT IN YOUR MOUTH? 
IS THAT A EUPHORAZINE?

309
00:10:47,521 --> 00:10:49,523
LINDSAY, SPIT IT OUT! 
THAT'S NOT REAL HAPPINESS!

310
00:10:49,523 --> 00:10:51,191
- WELL, IT'S BETTER 
THAN WHAT WE'VE GOT NOW.

311
00:10:51,191 --> 00:10:52,234
- LINDSAY, SPIT IT OUT!

312
00:10:52,234 --> 00:10:54,153
narrator: 
AND MICHAEL ARRIVED HOME,

313
00:10:54,153 --> 00:10:56,280
DETERMINED TO PROVE 
THAT HE WAS, IN FACT, FUN.

314
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:58,407
- I JUST BOOKED US 
A LITTLE FISHING TRIP.

315
00:10:58,407 --> 00:10:59,659
- BUT WHY? 
WHAT DID I DO?

316
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:01,994
- HMM? NO, NO. 
THIS IS A FUN THING!

317
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:04,121
OKAY? SOMETHING I'VE ALWAYS 
WANTED TO DO WITH YOU.

318
00:11:04,121 --> 00:11:06,581
EVERYBODY'S ALWAYS HAVING FUN 
AROUND HERE. WHY CAN'T WE?

319
00:11:06,581 --> 00:11:07,958
- [Lindsay, muffled] 
ALREADY DOWN!

320
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:11,128
GET YOUR FINGER 
OUT OF MY THROAT! IT'S DOWN!

321
00:11:11,128 --> 00:11:12,587
- ANYWAY, I THOUGHT 
YOU HATED FISHING.

322
00:11:12,587 --> 00:11:14,673
- NO, IT'S FUN. 
I LIKE FUN.

323
00:11:14,673 --> 00:11:17,968
I JUST HATED DOING IT 
WITH MY DAD.

324
00:11:17,968 --> 00:11:21,346
THIS IS GONNA BE 
YOU AND ME. OKAY?

325
00:11:21,346 --> 00:11:23,057
WE GET TO STAY AT A HOTEL, 
GET UP AT 4:00 A.M.,

326
00:11:23,057 --> 00:11:25,559
SLAP ON 
THE OLD SEASICK PATCH.

327
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:27,352
WE'RE GONNA GET OUT THERE 
ON THE CHOPPY OCEAN.

328
00:11:27,352 --> 00:11:29,354
WE'RE GONNA 
CATCH OURSELVES A LITTLE LUNCH.

329
00:11:29,354 --> 00:11:31,857
- OH, WE GET TO EAT IT?

330
00:11:31,857 --> 00:11:33,233
- AFTER WE GUT IT.

331
00:11:33,233 --> 00:11:35,027
- YES.

332
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:37,738
narrator: WHILE THE BLUTH BOYS 
CONTEMPLATED HAVING FUN,

333
00:11:37,738 --> 00:11:41,033
LUCILLE HAD A REQUEST 
FOR GOB'S BACHELOR PARTY.

334
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:42,284
- WHY DO I HAVE TO 
BRING HIM?

335
00:11:42,284 --> 00:11:43,953
- BECAUSE BUSTER'S YOUR BROTHER,

336
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:45,955
AND I'M NOT GONNA LEAVE HIM 
HOME ALONE WITH ALL THIS

337
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:48,290
J-U-I-C-E AROUND.

338
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:51,251
- I CAN SPELL, MOM. 
YOU SPELLED "JUICE."

339
00:11:51,251 --> 00:11:53,921
- OH, YOU'RE SO BRILLIANT. 
LET'S SEE YOU FIND IT.

340
00:11:53,921 --> 00:11:57,842
BESIDES, I'M GOING TO ANNYONG'S 
SOCCER AWARD CEREMONY--

341
00:11:57,842 --> 00:11:59,384
- ANNYONG.

342
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:07,101
- AND I DON'T NEED THE OTHER 
SOCCER MOMS

343
00:12:07,101 --> 00:12:10,229
KNOWING HOW OLD 
MY FIRST BATCH OF KIDS ARE.

344
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:12,231
- YEAH, I THINK THEY'RE GONNA 
KNOW THAT ANNYONG'S--

345
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:13,232
- ANNYONG.

346
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:16,068
- WOULD SOMEBODY PLEASE TELL 
THIS INSUFFERABLE CHILD TO--

347
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:17,862
GOD!

348
00:12:17,862 --> 00:12:19,905
narrator: AND SO, 
AS MICHAEL AND HIS SON...

349
00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:22,074
CHECKED INTO THE HOTEL, 
HIS BROTHERS ARRIVED.

350
00:12:22,074 --> 00:12:23,325
- WHAT ARE YOU GUYS DOING HERE?

351
00:12:23,325 --> 00:12:25,744
- OH, WE'RE HAVING 
GOB'S BACHELOR PARTY.

352
00:12:25,744 --> 00:12:26,996
YOU'RE NOT GOING?

353
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:29,206
Even dad's coming-- [giggles] 
VIA SATELLITE.

354
00:12:29,206 --> 00:12:30,958
- UH, NO. I'M GONNA 
GO FISHING WITH MY SON HERE.

355
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:32,877
WE'RE GONNA GO HAVE SOME FUN.

356
00:12:32,877 --> 00:12:34,128
REAL FUN. OKAY?

357
00:12:34,128 --> 00:12:38,132
NOT EVERYTHING IS STRIPPERS 
AND BOOZE AND BUCKETS OF BLOOD.

358
00:12:38,132 --> 00:12:40,926
WHY DO YOU GUYS 
HAVE BUCKETS OF BLOOD?

359
00:12:40,926 --> 00:12:43,137
- IT'S NOT REAL BLOOD. 
IT'S CORN SYRUP AND RED DYE.

360
00:12:43,137 --> 00:12:45,890
- JUICE. 
- WE HAVE UNLIMITED JUICE?

361
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:49,810
[chuckles] THIS PARTY IS GONNA 
BE OFF THE HOOK.

362
00:12:51,728 --> 00:12:53,772
narrator: MEANWHILE, 
AT THE WELLNESS CONVENTION

363
00:12:53,772 --> 00:12:55,149
IN THE VERY SAME HOTEL,

364
00:12:55,149 --> 00:12:59,194
DR. FUNKE'S 100% NATURAL GOOD 
TIME FAMILY-BAND SOLUTION

365
00:12:59,194 --> 00:13:01,238
WAS PREPARING FOR THEIR SHOW.

366
00:13:01,238 --> 00:13:03,866
- HERE ARE THE NEW 
EUPHORAZINE SIDE EFFECTS.

367
00:13:03,866 --> 00:13:05,117
- AH, THE SOLO.

368
00:13:05,117 --> 00:13:08,162
THAT IS FOR MY LOVELY 
AND TALENTED DAUGHTER.

369
00:13:08,162 --> 00:13:09,413
- "DELAYED IRRITABILITY?"

370
00:13:09,413 --> 00:13:10,580
WHAT DO THEY MEAN 
BY DELAYED?

371
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:12,332
- IT MEANS IT COMES LATER! 
THIS IS RIDICULOUS!

372
00:13:12,332 --> 00:13:13,876
WHY DO WE 
EVEN HAVE TO DO THIS?

373
00:13:13,876 --> 00:13:17,212
- WE ARE DOING THIS TO KEEP OUR 
FAMILY TOGETHER.

374
00:13:17,212 --> 00:13:18,964
- NO, I'M SERIOUS. 
LOOK AT US.

375
00:13:18,964 --> 00:13:20,299
WE'RE DRESSED LIKE 
WE'RE IN THE '60S.

376
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:22,801
IT'S THE 21ST CENTURY. WE SHOULD 
BE DRESSING LIKE IT'S THE '80S.

377
00:13:22,801 --> 00:13:23,802
- LINDSAY--

378
00:13:23,802 --> 00:13:25,220
- I'M TIRED OF TRYING TO FIND 
HAPPINESS

379
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:26,763
THROUGH LIES 
AND SELF-MEDICATING.

380
00:13:26,763 --> 00:13:29,808
IF YOU NEED ME, 
I'LL BE AT THE BAR.

381
00:13:29,808 --> 00:13:31,852
- WELL, FINE, LINDSAY. 
THAT'S FINE.

382
00:13:31,852 --> 00:13:35,272
MAEBY AND I'LL JUST DO-- 
- YEAH. I'M OUT TOO.

383
00:13:38,442 --> 00:13:40,110
- YOU THINK YOU CAN HANDLE IT 
ALONE?

384
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:43,572
'CAUSE IF YOU DON'T 
PERFORM, WE DON'T VALIDATE.

385
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:50,079
narrator: BACK IN MICHAEL'S 
HOTEL ROOM,

386
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:52,122
THE GUYS WERE SETTLING DOWN 
FOR THE NIGHT,

387
00:13:52,122 --> 00:13:54,959
SO AS TO BE READY FOR THEIR 
4:00 A.M. WAKE-UP CALL.

388
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:56,501
- IT SURE SOUNDS LIKE THEY'RE 
HAVING FUN

389
00:13:56,501 --> 00:13:57,794
OUT THERE BY THE POOL.

390
00:13:57,794 --> 00:14:00,172
- OH, THEY THINK THEY'RE HAVING 
FUN, SON,

391
00:14:00,172 --> 00:14:02,007
BUT IT'S NOT LASTING FUN.

392
00:14:02,007 --> 00:14:07,221
IT IS FLEETING FUN, 
LIKE A BACHELOR PARTY.

393
00:14:07,221 --> 00:14:08,472
WHAT WE GOT HERE 
IS LASTING FUN.

394
00:14:08,472 --> 00:14:12,351
OKAY? 
YOU THINK ABOUT THAT.

395
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:15,812
GOOD NIGHT, SON. 
- GOOD NIGHT, DAD.

396
00:14:15,812 --> 00:14:17,272
- MARCO! 
- POLO!

397
00:14:18,648 --> 00:14:20,860
- MARCO! 
- POLO!

398
00:14:21,944 --> 00:14:23,528
- MARCO!

399
00:14:23,528 --> 00:14:27,449
- HEY, DAD? 
- POLO!

400
00:14:27,449 --> 00:14:31,036
- DAD, ARE YOU STILL AWAKE? 
- STILL AWAKE.

401
00:14:31,036 --> 00:14:33,330
- IT'S JUST, UM--

402
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:35,749
I MEAN, THIS IS REALLY FUN 
AND EVERYTHING--

403
00:14:35,749 --> 00:14:38,835
- THIS ISN'T EVEN THE FUN PART. 
TOMORROW--

404
00:14:38,835 --> 00:14:41,005
- YEAH.

405
00:14:41,005 --> 00:14:43,548
THE PROBLEM I'M HAVING 
IS, UH--

406
00:14:43,548 --> 00:14:45,342
I HAVE A PRETTY FINELY TUNED 
INTERNAL CLOCK--

407
00:14:45,342 --> 00:14:47,887
- MM-HMM.

408
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:50,347
WHICH IS WHY I'M ACTUALLY SUCH A 
GOOD NATURAL PERCUSSIONIST.

409
00:14:50,347 --> 00:14:52,975
AND, UM--

410
00:14:52,975 --> 00:14:55,269
I'M JUST WORRIED THAT I'M NOT 
GONNA BE ABLE TO FALL ASLEEP...

411
00:14:55,269 --> 00:14:57,897
FOR ANOTHER TWO HOURS 
AND 45 MINUTES.

412
00:14:57,897 --> 00:14:59,439
SO, I WAS THINKING 
MAYBE I WOULD GO DOWN

413
00:14:59,439 --> 00:15:01,316
AND CHECK OUT MAEBY'S BAND,

414
00:15:01,316 --> 00:15:02,567
AND YOU COULD GO SEE

415
00:15:02,567 --> 00:15:03,860
IF GOB'S BACHELOR PARTY 
HAS STARTED.

416
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:07,281
- SHH, SHH, SHH. 
I'M RIGHT WHERE I WANT TO BE.

417
00:15:07,281 --> 00:15:09,408
GOB HAD HIS CHANCE 
TO HAVE ME THERE,

418
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:11,035
BUT IF YOU'RE SURE 
THAT YOU CAN'T SLEEP.

419
00:15:11,035 --> 00:15:12,286
- WELL, IT'S JUST--I DON'T KNOW

420
00:15:12,286 --> 00:15:14,454
WHEN I'M GONNA GET ANOTHER 
CHANCE LIKE THIS,

421
00:15:14,454 --> 00:15:15,705
YOU KNOW, TO BE THERE FOR 
FAMILY.

422
00:15:15,705 --> 00:15:16,706
- RIGHT.

423
00:15:16,706 --> 00:15:18,667
- I'D HATE TO MISS IT, 
BECAUSE I WAS TOO PROUD.

424
00:15:18,667 --> 00:15:20,502
- RIGHT.

425
00:15:24,048 --> 00:15:25,299
WAIT A MINUTE. 
"TOO PROUD?"

426
00:15:25,299 --> 00:15:28,427
WHAT DOES THIS HAVE TO DO 
WITH "TOO PROUD?"

427
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:30,804
- ACTUALLY, THAT PART 
WAS KINDA JUST FOR YOU.

428
00:15:30,804 --> 00:15:32,847
I WAS JUST WORRIED THE WHOLE 
THING WASN'T GONNA LAND

429
00:15:32,847 --> 00:15:36,226
UNLESS I INCLUDED THE PRIDE 
PART.

430
00:15:36,226 --> 00:15:37,811
narrator: UPSTAIRS, GOB WAS 
PREPARING

431
00:15:37,811 --> 00:15:38,938
TO SET UP THE ACCOUNTANT,

432
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:41,690
UNDER HIS FATHER'S 
HELPFUL GAZE.

433
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:42,942
- WHO CALLED THE COPS?

434
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:44,234
narrator: AND WITH THE AID 
OF SOME HELPFUL GAYS.

435
00:15:44,234 --> 00:15:46,236
- YOU TOLD ME TO HIRE PEOPLE 
TO LOOK LIKE MY FRIENDS.

436
00:15:46,236 --> 00:15:48,447
THEY'RE HOT COPS. 
THEY'RE ENTERTAINERS.

437
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:49,864
ALTHOUGH I SPECIFICALLY 
ASKED THEM

438
00:15:49,864 --> 00:15:52,117
NOT TO COME 
DRESSED AS COPS.

439
00:15:52,117 --> 00:15:53,368
YOU BETTER CHANGE NOW.

440
00:15:53,368 --> 00:15:55,912
HE'S GONNA BE HERE SOON. 
BUTCH, GUYS. I WANT IT BUTCH.

441
00:15:55,912 --> 00:15:57,872
- HEY, UH, 
YOU GOT THE BLOOD. RIGHT?

442
00:15:57,872 --> 00:15:59,291
- YEAH, I GOT TWO BUCKETS FULL 
RIGHT--

443
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:00,960
HEY! WHAT THE HELL 
HAPPENED TO THE BLOOD?

444
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,962
[giggling]

445
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:06,090
- HEY, BROTHER. 
- WHOA!

446
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:07,716
SOMEBODY PUT ON HIS LIPSTICK IN 
THE CAR.

447
00:16:07,716 --> 00:16:09,426
- I LOVE JUICE!

448
00:16:09,426 --> 00:16:10,802
- THIS NEXT NUMBER 
IS THE ONLY BALLAD

449
00:16:10,802 --> 00:16:14,098
THAT THE SOLUTION 
EVER ATTEMPTED.

450
00:16:14,098 --> 00:16:16,558
AND I MUST SAY 
I FEEL A BIT LIKE A MARY...

451
00:16:16,558 --> 00:16:21,981
WITHOUT A PETER AND A PAUL, 
BUT I SUPPOSE IT'S WORTH A SHOT.

452
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:24,566
[singing] THERE'S NO "I" IN 
TEAMOCIL

453
00:16:24,566 --> 00:16:25,859
AT LEAST NOT WHERE 
YOU'D THINK

454
00:16:25,859 --> 00:16:29,071
[strumming]

455
00:16:29,071 --> 00:16:31,323
SO TOGETHER 
LET'S MAKE A CHOICE

456
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:35,244
- AND FOR ONCE 
WE'LL BE IN SYNC

457
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:39,539
- TEAMOCI-IL

458
00:16:39,539 --> 00:16:42,334
- I NEVER THOUGHT 
I KNEW YOU WELL

459
00:16:42,334 --> 00:16:44,794
- TEAMOCI-I-IL

460
00:16:44,794 --> 00:16:47,506
- NOW I THINK 
WE REALLY GEL

461
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:53,595
[harmonizing] 
TEAMOCIL

462
00:16:53,595 --> 00:16:55,722
- "TEAMOCIL IS 
NO LONGER AVAILABLE.

463
00:16:55,722 --> 00:16:56,973
PLEASE TRY EITHER 
GROUPHUG,

464
00:16:56,973 --> 00:16:58,517
BONDAT OR CONSULT 
YOUR OWN WELLNESS GUIDE."

465
00:16:58,517 --> 00:17:01,103
- TEAMOCIL! 
[weak clapping]

466
00:17:03,105 --> 00:17:05,482
- YOU'RE OUT OF THE BAND.

467
00:17:05,482 --> 00:17:07,609
narrator: AND, BACK 
AT THE BACHELOR PARTY...

468
00:17:07,609 --> 00:17:10,445
GILLIGAN HAD ARRIVED, 
AND THE CON WAS IN FULL SWING.

469
00:17:10,445 --> 00:17:12,447
- IT'S IRA, 
AND I'M FINE.

470
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:14,574
- COME ON! 
HAVE A DRINK!

471
00:17:14,574 --> 00:17:15,825
THERE'S SOME 
STUFF COMING UP

472
00:17:15,825 --> 00:17:17,452
YOU MIGHT NOT BE ABLE 
TO HANDLE SOBER.

473
00:17:17,452 --> 00:17:20,955
- SPEAKING OF WHICH, 
WHERE'S BUSTER?

474
00:17:20,955 --> 00:17:22,916
narrator: IN FACT, BUSTER HAD 
FINISHED THE JUICE...

475
00:17:22,916 --> 00:17:25,210
AND WAS DESPERATELY LOOKING 
FOR HIS NEXT SUGAR FIX--

476
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:26,336
- [growls]

477
00:17:26,336 --> 00:17:29,131
WHEN HE DISCOVERED THE CAKE 
IN THE NEXT ROOM.

478
00:17:29,131 --> 00:17:30,382
UNFORTUNATELY, HE WAS UNAWARE

479
00:17:30,382 --> 00:17:32,884
OF THE NARCOLEPTIC STRIPPER 
CONFINED WITHIN IT.

480
00:17:32,884 --> 00:17:34,553
[screams]

481
00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:36,138
[snores]

482
00:17:36,138 --> 00:17:37,431
- YEAH, I BETTER GO IN THE 
BACK ROOM

483
00:17:37,431 --> 00:17:38,432
AND HAVE A LOOK 
FOR HIM.

484
00:17:38,432 --> 00:17:39,683
- IRA, HAVE A DRINK!

485
00:17:39,683 --> 00:17:42,311
- I'M NOT THIRSTY. 
I WANT SOME FOOD.

486
00:17:42,311 --> 00:17:44,604
- OOH. 
[snoring]

487
00:17:44,604 --> 00:17:46,648
OKAY. KEEP IT TOGETHER. 
DON'T GO ALL MICHAEL HERE.

488
00:17:46,648 --> 00:17:49,359
- KNOCK, KNOCK! 
WHERE'S THE MARRIED BACHELOR?

489
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:50,944
- MICHAEL, 
I THOUGHT YOU WEREN'T COMING.

490
00:17:50,944 --> 00:17:52,028
I THOUGHT HE WASN'T COMING!

491
00:17:52,028 --> 00:17:53,155
- WELL, I WASN'T GOING TO,

492
00:17:53,155 --> 00:17:55,657
BUT HE'S MY BROTHER, 
AND I'M HERE TO SUPPORT HIM,

493
00:17:55,657 --> 00:18:00,954
LIKE ALL THESE, UH, 
HOT MEN AND IRA.

494
00:18:00,954 --> 00:18:02,206
- WELL, YOU'RE NOT 
GONNA STAY.

495
00:18:02,206 --> 00:18:04,124
I MEAN, 
THIS ISN'T YOUR KIND OF SCENE.

496
00:18:04,124 --> 00:18:05,667
DAD, PLEASE, STAY OUT OF IT, 
ALL RIGHT?

497
00:18:05,667 --> 00:18:07,669
I'M HERE FOR GOB. 
NOW, WHERE ARE THE STRIPPERS?

498
00:18:07,669 --> 00:18:08,920
- WELL, I--

499
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:10,214
- MMM! YOU GOT A LITTLE 
BACK ROOM GOING, HUH?

500
00:18:10,214 --> 00:18:12,216
HUH? HUH? 
- WELL--

501
00:18:12,216 --> 00:18:14,093
- JUST RELAX. 
I'M AS FUN AS ANYBODY.

502
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:17,429
I CAN HANDLE 
A BACK ROOM.

503
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:18,680
I'M CALLING THE COPS. 
- NO!

504
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,224
- WE'RE CHANGING AGAIN, GUYS!

505
00:18:20,224 --> 00:18:24,394
- NO. NO COPS. 
- WELL, WHAT IS THIS?

506
00:18:24,394 --> 00:18:26,688
- SHE DIED. 
SHE'S DEAD.

507
00:18:26,688 --> 00:18:29,483
IT WAS GILLIGAN! 
- WHAT?

508
00:18:29,483 --> 00:18:31,526
- GILLIGAN KILLED 
THE SKIPPER--STRIPPER.

509
00:18:31,526 --> 00:18:32,694
- I DIDN'T KILL 
ANY STRIPPER.

510
00:18:32,694 --> 00:18:34,154
- YOU'RE DRUNK. 
YOU DON'T REMEMBER.

511
00:18:34,154 --> 00:18:36,490
- YOU'RE PULLING THE RIP CORD! 
ARE YOU NUTS?

512
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:37,574
- IRA, TAKE MY HONEYMOON 
TICKETS.

513
00:18:37,574 --> 00:18:40,535
GET OUT OF THE COUNTRY. 
SAVE YOURSELF.

514
00:18:40,535 --> 00:18:42,496
- I'M NOT DRUNK. BIX MADE ME 
THE DESIGNATED DRIVER.

515
00:18:42,496 --> 00:18:44,331
- BIX!

516
00:18:44,331 --> 00:18:46,708
narrator: 
JUST THEN, THE STRIPPER WOKE UP,

517
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:49,169
SAW BUSTER WITH WHAT APPEARED 
TO BE BLOOD AROUND HIS MOUTH,

518
00:18:49,169 --> 00:18:51,045
AND THOUGHT SHE HAD KILLED HIM 
FOR GROPING HER.

519
00:18:51,045 --> 00:18:53,423
- NOT AGAIN.

520
00:18:58,928 --> 00:18:59,971
- YOU WERE SETTING ME UP.

521
00:18:59,971 --> 00:19:02,141
YOU'RE TRYING TO GET ME 
TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY.

522
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:04,976
WELL, THE HELL WITH YOU, SIR. 
BIX, WE'RE LEAVING.

523
00:19:04,976 --> 00:19:10,315
I'M TESTIFYING.

524
00:19:10,315 --> 00:19:12,442
- YOU WERE TRYING 
TO SET IRA UP?

525
00:19:12,442 --> 00:19:15,487
- OH, GOB, GOB. 
COME ON. IS THIS TRUE?

526
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:18,240
- OH, WAIT A MINUTE. 
IT WASN'T YOUR IDEA, GOB.

527
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,533
IT WAS YOUR IDEA. 
WASN'T IT, DAD?

528
00:19:19,533 --> 00:19:22,411
- IT WA-- 
- HUH?

529
00:19:22,411 --> 00:19:23,703
- EVEN IF IT WAS MY IDEA, 
WHICH IT WASN'T,

530
00:19:23,703 --> 00:19:27,374
GOB SCREWED IT UP, 
WHICH HE DID AND ALWAYS DOES.

531
00:19:27,374 --> 00:19:28,583
- YOU DON'T HAVE TO TAKE THAT.

532
00:19:28,583 --> 00:19:30,960
- WHAT THE HELL 
AM I SUPPOSED TO DO?

533
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:34,839
- HERE.

534
00:19:34,839 --> 00:19:37,342
- OH, NO. NO, NO. 
DON'T YOU DARE, MISTER.

535
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:41,180
- DO IT. DO IT.

536
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:44,140
- HEY, GOB! I AM YOUR BEST MAN. 
I AM YOUR FATH--

537
00:19:47,143 --> 00:19:48,395
- [sighs] 
WHAT DOES IT MATTER?

538
00:19:48,395 --> 00:19:51,064
I SCREWED IT UP ANYWAY. 
A COMPLETE FAILURE.

539
00:19:51,064 --> 00:19:52,857
CAN'T EVEN FAKE THE DEATH 
OF A STRIPPER.

540
00:19:52,857 --> 00:19:55,610
- OH, COME ON. 
THAT'S NOT A BAD THING.

541
00:19:55,610 --> 00:19:57,571
IT DOESN'T MAKE YOU A FAILURE. 
DAD'S THE FAILURE.

542
00:19:57,571 --> 00:19:58,822
- REALLY?

543
00:19:58,822 --> 00:20:01,450
WHEN HE WAS MY AGE, HE RAN 
AN ENTIRE COMPANY, HAD KIDS.

544
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:02,701
- THE COMPANY WAS CORRUPT.

545
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:04,828
LOOK WHAT HE'S TRYING 
TO DO TO US.

546
00:20:04,828 --> 00:20:05,912
I'LL TELL YOU 
SOMETHING ELSE.

547
00:20:05,912 --> 00:20:07,247
YOU MIGHT NOT BE A FATHER, 
YOU KNOW, GOB,

548
00:20:07,247 --> 00:20:09,165
BUT YOU ARE MY BROTHER.

549
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:15,088
- I MIGHT BE A FATHER.

550
00:20:15,088 --> 00:20:17,299
- WHY DON'T YOU START TRUSTING 
YOURSELF. OKAY? NOT DAD.

551
00:20:17,299 --> 00:20:19,343
YOU'RE A MUCH BETTER MAN 
THAN HE IS.

552
00:20:19,343 --> 00:20:20,719
- YOU'RE A BETTER MAN 
THAN BOTH OF US.

553
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:22,304
- WELL.

554
00:20:22,304 --> 00:20:26,057
- YOU'RE THE BEST MAN. 
YOU'RE MY BEST MAN.

555
00:20:26,057 --> 00:20:27,351
NOT IF I HAVE 
AN ACTUAL CEREMONY,

556
00:20:27,351 --> 00:20:29,185
'CAUSE DAD WOULD KILL ME, BUT--

557
00:20:29,185 --> 00:20:30,437
WHAT DO YOU SAY, HERMANO?

558
00:20:30,437 --> 00:20:32,647
HELP ME CLEAN UP 
THIS MESS?

559
00:20:32,647 --> 00:20:35,817
- WHAT THE HELL.

560
00:20:35,817 --> 00:20:38,987
- GOB, I WANT OUT.

561
00:20:38,987 --> 00:20:41,240
- I'M IN LOVE WITH YOUR BROTHER. 
- WHAT?

562
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,574
YOU DID IT AGAIN, 
YOU SON OF A BITCH!

563
00:20:42,574 --> 00:20:45,076
- NO, NO!

564
00:20:46,411 --> 00:20:49,498
- IN-LAW. TOBIAS.

565
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:51,416
SORRY. I SHOULD HAVE 
FINISHED THAT THOUGHT.

566
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:54,002
narrator: ON THE NEXT 
ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT.

567
00:20:54,002 --> 00:20:55,879
- OH, MY GOD. 
I KILLED MICHAEL.

568
00:20:55,879 --> 00:20:58,340
- YEAH, BUT ON THE PLUS SIDE, 
YOU GOT PUNCHED IN THE FACE.

569
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:02,344
- HEY, BROTHER. 
HEY, BROTHER.

570
00:21:02,344 --> 00:21:05,054
narrator: MICHAEL SOLVES THE 
MYSTERY OF THE MISSING MONEY.

571
00:21:05,054 --> 00:21:08,350
- IRA WAS SIGNATORY 
TO ALL THESE ACCOUNTS?

572
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:10,685
[beeps] 
GET ME IRA GILLIGAN.

573
00:21:10,685 --> 00:21:12,145
narrator: AND GILLIGAN...

574
00:21:12,145 --> 00:21:16,149
FULFILLS HIS DESTINY. 
[cell phone ringing]

575
00:21:16,149 --> 00:21:18,151
- LET IT RING.
