[Ron Howard] <i>While waiting for Michael</i>
<i>to return from prison with Buster,</i>

2
00:00:14,681 --> 00:00:18,018
<i>the Bluth family was recycling</i>
<i>a welcome home party.</i>

3
00:00:18,101 --> 00:00:20,770
Why do we have to have
a party<i> </i>every time someone in this family

4
00:00:20,854 --> 00:00:23,565
-is released from prison?
-Tradition.

5
00:00:23,648 --> 00:00:25,066
-Some traditions get old.
-[sighs]

6
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:27,277
Like that god-awful thing
you used to make me do

7
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:28,486
on your birthday.

8
00:00:29,112 --> 00:00:30,155
Cook?

9
00:00:30,697 --> 00:00:33,616
Plus, we have some business problems
to deal with.

10
00:00:33,825 --> 00:00:35,952
Sally Sitwell
won the election and now,

11
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:38,788
for whatever reason,
supports building the wall.

12
00:00:39,205 --> 00:00:41,207
We need to come up
with two million dollars

13
00:00:41,332 --> 00:00:43,543
-or we're gonna make powerful enemies.
-Okay.

14
00:00:43,668 --> 00:00:45,128
-Right, shush.
-[door closes]

15
00:00:45,211 --> 00:00:46,755
Not in front of the grandkids.
I don't want them to know

16
00:00:46,838 --> 00:00:48,089
about the shady business scams

17
00:00:48,173 --> 00:00:50,508
-that go on in this family.
-We lied to investors,

18
00:00:50,592 --> 00:00:53,303
so we have no product
and we're two million dollars in debt.

19
00:00:53,386 --> 00:00:55,180
The next welcome home party's
gonna be for us.

20
00:00:55,263 --> 00:00:57,766
Oh, don't be ridiculous.
My name isn't on anything.

21
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:00,602
Why are you so riled up all of a sudden?

22
00:01:00,685 --> 00:01:03,021
[Ron] <i>He was nervous</i>
<i>because after his girlfriend invested</i>

23
00:01:03,104 --> 00:01:04,606
<i>in his non-existent business,</i>

24
00:01:04,689 --> 00:01:05,857
...everybody needs a bail-out...

25
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:08,234
<i>The pressures of his lie only grew worse.</i>

26
00:01:08,318 --> 00:01:10,070
-...a date with a sexy man.
-What? I thought

27
00:01:10,153 --> 00:01:12,697
-I was taking you out tonight.
-[Rebel] Oh, relax, you're fine.

28
00:01:12,781 --> 00:01:15,200
Know what? I've neverÂ been attracted
to handsome men.

29
00:01:15,283 --> 00:01:16,117
Ah.

30
00:01:16,201 --> 00:01:20,038
Fakeblock is gonna change the world.
Which reminds me, I'm dying to see it.

31
00:01:20,622 --> 00:01:24,834
No, I know, it's-- We've just been busy
with all our coding and all the goddamn...

32
00:01:24,918 --> 00:01:28,254
[chuckles] ...coding and, um...

33
00:01:28,338 --> 00:01:29,714
also programming, so it's ju--

34
00:01:29,798 --> 00:01:32,675
But as soon as it's up and running,
we'll-- we'll get you over there and--

35
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:36,971
No. As a part-owner, I want to see it
while all the work is happening,

36
00:01:37,055 --> 00:01:39,265
-and I'm not gonna take no for an answer.
-Well, but,

37
00:01:39,349 --> 00:01:40,767
-the coding, and...
-[Maeby] <i>Well, problem solved.</i>

38
00:01:41,184 --> 00:01:42,185
Stick her with all of it.

39
00:01:42,268 --> 00:01:43,895
Let her buy it.
She'll get all our liabilities,

40
00:01:43,978 --> 00:01:45,772
and then anything
over two million, we get to keep.

41
00:01:45,855 --> 00:01:48,191
I can't do that
to someone that I have feelings for.

42
00:01:48,274 --> 00:01:50,068
So stop having feelings for her.

43
00:01:50,401 --> 00:01:52,195
What?
Is that something you can do with people?

44
00:01:52,362 --> 00:01:54,447
Yeah, once I learned
how to do it with my parents,

45
00:01:54,531 --> 00:01:57,617
it was easy with everyone else.
It's like a heart switch, you know?

46
00:01:57,951 --> 00:02:00,745
Click. I love you. Click. I love you not.

47
00:02:00,829 --> 00:02:03,623
Click. I love you. Click. I love you not.

48
00:02:03,998 --> 00:02:04,916
Can't you do that?

49
00:02:05,708 --> 00:02:08,086
No, but in my defense,
I'm not a sociopath.

00:02:08,711 --> 00:02:11,214
[dramatic music plays]

51
00:02:12,507 --> 00:02:13,508

[Ron] <i>On the other side</i>

53
00:02:16,427 --> 00:02:18,888

-He's alive. He got out.

57
00:02:27,272 --> 00:02:28,481

<i>-he'll be staying that way.</i>
-Why wouldn't he come out?

60
00:02:34,445 --> 00:02:38,074
Oh, who knows what makes a guy
think he can pass for straight?

61
00:02:38,449 --> 00:02:40,702
I mean, if he really is gay,
he can try to hide it,

62
00:02:40,785 --> 00:02:42,954
but trust me, it will come out

63
00:02:43,037 --> 00:02:44,831
in the most unexpected balls.

64
00:02:45,415 --> 00:02:46,916
Yeah, but the problem is
that now the world thinks

65
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,585
that I'm gay, and if I say it was a trick,

66
00:02:48,668 --> 00:02:51,045
well, then the alliance
will have <i>me </i>by the balls.

67
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,840
Uh... [laughs]

68
00:02:54,215 --> 00:02:55,967
Excuse me, "balls"?

69
00:02:56,467 --> 00:02:59,053
You realize you just said "balls"?
[chuckles]

70
00:02:59,137 --> 00:03:01,014
-But you said balls.
-[chuckling] Oh, well that's

71
00:03:01,097 --> 00:03:02,807
three times I'm hearing balls now.

72
00:03:03,558 --> 00:03:05,602
I put... You said balls, so...
Then I said balls...

73
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:08,146
Why don't you tell Rebel
she can't see the company?

74
00:03:08,229 --> 00:03:10,398
Then she's gonna know
I'm not a tech entrepreneur

75
00:03:10,481 --> 00:03:11,482
named George Maharis.

76
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:14,152
-And I'm the sociopath.
-[Gob] Both of our hands

77
00:03:14,235 --> 00:03:15,737
-were all over...
-What if I take her there,

78
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:18,072
but it's locked, and I can't wait
to eat this snow cone.

79
00:03:18,156 --> 00:03:19,949
-Lovely party.
-Yeah, it is a great party.

80
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:22,911
What if I take her there,
but it's locked and we can't get in?

81
00:03:22,994 --> 00:03:25,955
That's the sign of a healthy business.
It's closed in the middle of a Tuesday,

82
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:27,749
-and the owner's locked out.
-[John Beard] <i>Of course,</i>

83

<i>Not real protestors, but that's</i>
<i>kind of the norm now, isn't it?</i>

85
00:03:33,588 --> 00:03:35,131
What if she's afraid to go in?

86
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:37,592
'Cause there's angry protesters out front?

87
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:41,221
-Who would protest a tech company?
-Anonymous.

00:03:41,804 --> 00:03:43,473
-What's that?
-You don't know Anonymous?

89
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:46,142
They're those hacker guys that
wear those Guy Fawkes masks?

90
00:03:47,018 --> 00:03:49,437
Oh, shit.
That's who the note was from.

[chuckling] Gay Gob's funny.

113
00:04:41,155 --> 00:04:44,075
Uh, do you think they could be Anonymous?
Like Guy Fawkeses?

114
00:04:44,492 --> 00:04:45,368
Guy Fawkeses?

115
00:04:45,451 --> 00:04:46,536
[George Michael] Can you get me
guys like that?

I would not hold my balls on that one.

118

-[Ron] <i>And finally, Michael returned...</i>
-Where's Buster?

119
00:04:55,753 --> 00:04:57,088
<i>-...without the guest of honor.</i>
-Don't you have him?

120
00:04:57,171 --> 00:05:00,633
No. I went to the jail to pick him up,
and no one there has seen him

121
00:05:00,717 --> 00:05:01,676
since the parade.

122
00:05:01,926 --> 00:05:04,637
Now, you did let him know
he was being released, right?

123
00:05:04,762 --> 00:05:07,223
[Lucille] Well, I'm sure they told him
at the jail after the parade.

124
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:10,977
Mother Bluth,
I think you might be interested in this.

125
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:14,272
[Joni] <i>Oh, speaking of maniacs,</i>
<i>let's watch this again.</i>

126
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:17,859
<i>That's a real criminal</i>
<i>inside that makeshift jail cell.</i>

127
00:05:18,026 --> 00:05:19,944
<i>-It's a jailbreak.</i>
-[John] <i>You know, it's my...</i>

128
00:05:20,028 --> 00:05:21,446
Is that Oscar?

129
00:05:21,529 --> 00:05:22,989
Well, it's not you!

130
00:05:23,281 --> 00:05:25,450
Who even told Oscar Buster was in jail?

131
00:05:25,867 --> 00:05:27,785
[Ron] <i>Oscar was told by Barry,</i>

132
00:05:27,869 --> 00:05:29,829
<i>who had driven down to Mexico</i>

133
00:05:29,912 --> 00:05:32,498
<i>-and thought he was talking to George.</i>
-You <i>are </i>here!

134
00:05:32,582 --> 00:05:34,417
I came down here to warn you
that the cops want you

135
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,919
to lead them to the stair car,

136
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:39,547
because that's the evidence
that's gonna keep Buster in jail.

137
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:42,383
Buster's in jail? My boy. My boy.

138
00:05:42,467 --> 00:05:44,761
[Ron] <i>And so, Oscar used the parade</i>

139
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:48,264
<i>as cover</i>
<i>for breaking Buster out of prison,</i>

140
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:50,350
<i>knocking Stan Sitwell out</i>
<i>in the process.</i>

141
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:51,434
Dad? Dad!

142
00:05:52,393 --> 00:05:54,645
[Michael] So they escaped
from prison a half hour

143
00:05:54,729 --> 00:05:56,522
before he was gonna be
legally released?

144
00:05:56,606 --> 00:05:59,400
-[Lucille] No one told him.
-He's got a lot of spunk.

145
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:00,777
I like that on a guy.

146
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:03,529
If Oscar is with Buster,
then where is Lucille 2?

147
00:06:03,613 --> 00:06:06,741
I mean, she could be dead,
and Buster will be charged with murder.

148
00:06:06,908 --> 00:06:08,451
Or worse, she could come back,

149
00:06:08,534 --> 00:06:10,328
and they would charge us
with embezzlement.

150
00:06:10,411 --> 00:06:12,080
Okay. Buster thinks
he's broken out of prison.

151
00:06:12,163 --> 00:06:13,289
God knows what he's gonna do.

152
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:14,791
Well, somebody has to find him.

153
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:16,626
You're the cause of it,
and he does respond

154
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:18,628
-to your scent.
-I'll go with you,

155
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:20,797
and we will find our son together,

156
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:24,675
and perhaps we will find each other
along the way.

157
00:06:25,134 --> 00:06:27,345
Why don't you find some money
along the way

158
00:06:27,428 --> 00:06:29,305
to make up for the land you lost
in Mexico?

159
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:32,266
Father, Mother, please.

160
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:34,519
Our whole family is in crisis.

161
00:06:34,602 --> 00:06:37,271
For I have seen what happens
when families turn on each other.

{\an8}Yeah, that's an understatement.

192
00:08:02,064 --> 00:08:03,900
{\an8}All right.
You know I'd really like to be involved,

193

All right, I guess we should get out.

232
00:09:41,122 --> 00:09:43,249
[Buster] I probably shouldn't
have chained us together.

233
00:09:43,332 --> 00:09:45,084
[Oscar] No, no,
I should've brought a key,

234
00:09:45,167 --> 00:09:46,961
but actually, I think it helps sell

235
00:09:47,044 --> 00:09:48,754
the whole Keystone Cop thing,
because it had

236
00:09:48,838 --> 00:09:50,339
-to be something crazy.
-[laughs]

237
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:53,843

in silent movies, it's not real life.

-No.
-All right. So what do you think? Ready?

{\an8}-[Oscar] No.
-Or funny.

246
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:13,571

out of this.

247
00:10:13,654 --> 00:10:15,656
-Yeah.
-Okay, all right. Watch your hand.

248
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:17,241

-Are you okay?
-[shrieks]

250
00:10:21,412 --> 00:10:23,414
Wait a minute. It's a fake hand.
How can it hurt?

251
00:10:23,497 --> 00:10:26,876
No, it's a rental from prison,
and Mother said my next hand...

-All right.
-...is gonna be out of my own pocket--

Okay, wait. What's that over there?

It says Mother of God hospital.

255
00:10:32,798 --> 00:10:34,925
Maybe we can get you a replacement.

256
00:10:35,384 --> 00:10:37,803
But first, we gotta get
out of these prison clothes.

257
00:10:40,598 --> 00:10:41,474
{\an8}-All right.
-Okay.

258
00:10:41,557 --> 00:10:43,768
{\an8}Here's the deal.
We need a walking system

259
00:10:43,851 --> 00:10:45,311
{\an8}-so we don't just trip over each other.
-Yeah.

260
00:10:45,394 --> 00:10:48,105
{\an8}-Left, right. Left, right.
-Okay.

261
00:10:48,397 --> 00:10:50,650
So we always start with left.

262
00:10:50,733 --> 00:10:52,026
Smooth and easy.

263
00:10:52,276 --> 00:10:55,112
Lemon squeezy. And...

264
00:10:55,196 --> 00:10:56,614
[both] ...left--

265
00:10:56,697 --> 00:10:58,532
[Ron] <i>It wasn't a good system.</i>

266
00:10:58,949 --> 00:11:01,702
<i>But Oscar wasn't the only twin</i>
<i>that was down,</i>

267
00:11:01,786 --> 00:11:04,997
<i>because as Michael headed out</i>
<i>to keep the company alive...</i>

268
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:09,710
<i>he realized he'd need to do</i>
<i>the same for its founder.</i>

269
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:13,255
What are you doing with the hose?

270
00:11:14,924 --> 00:11:16,926
Wha... No, I didn't know it was on.

271
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:19,887
I mean,
I would never purposefully run a car

272
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:22,556
with the garage door closed
with the family in crisis.

273
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:25,059
Okay. You know, Dad,
this is an electric car.

274
00:11:25,142 --> 00:11:25,976
Oh.

275
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:28,437
So, the only thing
you're killing is my battery.

276
00:11:28,646 --> 00:11:32,608
Is that funny? I... Oh, God,
I can't get anything right.

277
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:35,695

-[Lucille] Oh, hi.

<i>...with whom Lucille found</i>

00:11:48,082 --> 00:11:50,710
[George Sr.] <i>I mean, she wouldn't go out</i>
<i>with me this afternoon,</i>

284

<i>-and I know it's because of him.</i>
-[Michael] <i>Dad,</i>

285
00:11:52,837 --> 00:11:55,589
I think you might be giving up,
uh, a little too easy.

286
00:11:55,673 --> 00:11:58,592
You know? I mean, Mom loves you.
She's just mad at you. You cheated on her.

287
00:11:59,009 --> 00:12:01,053
Or Uncle Oscar did, I don't know.
I lost the thread

288
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:02,888
on that one,
but she's probably just trying

289
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:05,725
to make you jealous, and so...
You're the head of the family,

290
00:12:05,808 --> 00:12:07,643
-give her something that she wants.
-Wha--

291
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:10,062
Are you saying that
I should go find Buster?

292
00:12:10,146 --> 00:12:11,939
Show her you're a good dad.
You know,

293
00:12:12,022 --> 00:12:14,024
besides, he's gonna need
to be found and told

294
00:12:14,108 --> 00:12:17,778
he's free before he does something illegal
and ends up back in prison.

295
00:12:17,862 --> 00:12:20,531
-Ah. Maybe Lucille will...
-You know? -Uh-huh.

296
00:12:20,614 --> 00:12:21,949
I don't know, let me back in.

297
00:12:22,032 --> 00:12:24,493
[exhales] Boy, you have to have
balls of steel

298
00:12:24,618 --> 00:12:26,412
to survive in a hole like that.

299
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:28,873
And the same could be said for prison.

300
00:12:32,209 --> 00:12:34,462
[Ron] <i>And soon,</i>
<i>Michael was going over the books</i>

301

302
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:40,009
"Joni Beard, Media Consultant."

303
00:12:40,092 --> 00:12:41,844
20K? What's that?

304
00:12:42,136 --> 00:12:43,679
K means thousand. [chuckles]

305
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:47,600
Can you believe Adhir
just expected me to know that? [laughs]

306
00:12:47,683 --> 00:12:50,978
I must've told him K times,
"You gotta help me with these things."

307
00:12:51,061 --> 00:12:53,147
I used to train dogs, so I'm very patient.

308
00:12:53,564 --> 00:12:55,816
And $10,000 for a printer?

309
00:12:56,025 --> 00:12:58,152
-10K.
-Good Gob. Good K.

310
00:12:59,361 --> 00:13:00,279
Yeah.

311
00:13:01,071 --> 00:13:03,532
And to be fair, it's a--
It was a 3-D printer.

312
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:05,159
Why do we need a 3-D printer?

313
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:07,703
Well, to be fair,
it's a 3-D dental printer.

314
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:10,080
But they're worth twice what I got them
to leave them here for.

315
00:13:10,164 --> 00:13:13,000
They must've been too slow for them,
but I thought, what do we care

316
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:15,419
if it takes two and a half hours
to print some molars?

317
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:17,338
Can you just get me a copy of the receipt?

318
00:13:17,421 --> 00:13:19,256
Hey, you want to spend a couple
hundred bucks on a 3-D receipt,

319
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:21,801
I'll have it printed
and in your mouth before sunset.

-[Gob] Capital money.

322
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:27,264
[quietly] Thank you.

323
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:30,434
[Adhir] I have all the books here.
Coming through.

324
00:13:30,726 --> 00:13:32,645
Including the ones Gob can't look at.

325
00:13:32,728 --> 00:13:35,147
Do you want the Austero-Bluth
or just the Bluth books?

326
00:13:35,231 --> 00:13:37,358
Well, I can only look at the Bluth books.

327
00:13:37,441 --> 00:13:40,402
The Austero books are
for British eyes only, as they say.

328
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:43,781
-[dramatic music plays]
-[woman] <i>âª For British eyes only âª</i>

329
00:13:44,406 --> 00:13:46,242
Okay. Uh, well, as copresident,

330
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:48,661
-I can look at the books that he can't.
-[Adhir] All right.

331
00:13:48,744 --> 00:13:50,830
I'm sorry I don't understand what...
No, I ju--

332
00:13:50,913 --> 00:13:53,415
Michael, if, look,
I'm the copresident, okay?

333
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:56,794
There's only room at this company
for one copresident.

334
00:13:56,877 --> 00:13:59,547
What's next? You're gonna want
one of my parking spaces, Michael?

335
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:01,966
I didn't know
that I was copresident myself.

336
00:14:02,049 --> 00:14:05,010
All right? I'm just here to help.
I'm not going to trump you.

337
00:14:05,094 --> 00:14:08,097
Oh, well, Michael, don't worry,
'cause I already went there.

338
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:09,265
<i>âª Balls in the air... âª</i>

339
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:11,141
[Gob] <i>Saturday and Sunday semester.</i>

340
00:14:11,392 --> 00:14:13,769
Best 17K Mom and Dad ever spent.

341
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:17,690
Anyway, I don't know why I'm not allowed
to look at the Austero books, but, uh,

342
00:14:17,773 --> 00:14:20,609
Mom does allow me to make
purchases from that account.

343
00:14:22,027 --> 00:14:22,903
Let me get this straight.

344
00:14:22,987 --> 00:14:25,322
You're only allowed to spend money
from the Austero account.

345
00:14:25,406 --> 00:14:26,365
Why are all the revenue

346
00:14:26,448 --> 00:14:28,951
from these investments only showing up
in the Bluth books?

347
00:14:29,034 --> 00:14:31,453
Would you be terribly offended
if I offered you a candy?

348
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:34,039
-I don't think Dad wanted me to see this.
-I don't, either.

349
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:37,459
And your mother has my passport,
so why don't we say that I was never here?

350
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:39,670
An absolute professional
pleasure to have met you.

351
00:14:39,753 --> 00:14:42,256
You know, I think that they had a plan

352
00:14:42,339 --> 00:14:44,800
that they were sure would work,
but now they need to get out,

353
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:47,970
and that's why he wants
an evaluation of all the assets.

354
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:49,513
-Good to see you.
-[Adhir] You're doing great.

355
00:14:49,597 --> 00:14:51,682
Yeah, he wants to find out
what he can sell off.

356
00:14:51,765 --> 00:14:54,560
And you know, since you're copresident,
your name's all over this.

357
00:14:54,643 --> 00:14:57,438
That means that whatever trouble
Dad is responsible for,

358
00:14:57,521 --> 00:14:58,939
you are also responsible for.

359
00:14:59,315 --> 00:15:04,028
So you're telling me
that Dad thinks I'm responsible.

360
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:06,614
Maybe it's time to show them
you <i>are </i>responsible.

361
00:15:06,697 --> 00:15:07,531
[Gob] Yeah.

362
00:15:07,698 --> 00:15:10,951
That you're notÂ looking for some reward
for doing the right thing.

363
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,454
-Or any reward.
-[Adhir over intercom] Good Gob.

364
00:15:15,164 --> 00:15:16,540
Oh, thanks, buddy.

365
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:19,877
They think I'm too stupid to...

366
00:15:20,502 --> 00:15:21,420
Help yourself.

367
00:15:23,464 --> 00:15:25,341
Yeah. You know what's funny?

368
00:15:25,674 --> 00:15:27,509
They think that I'm too stup--

369
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:29,303
[choking]

370
00:15:29,386 --> 00:15:31,931
-I already had one in there, so...
-We got to face facts.

371
00:15:32,014 --> 00:15:33,807
They're stuck.
These stick. They're stickers...

372
00:15:33,891 --> 00:15:35,935
Knowing what we know, we are complicit,

373
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:38,479
-which leaves us open to-- to liability.
-[whirs]

374
00:15:38,562 --> 00:15:41,857
You know, the easy choice
would be to quit.

375
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:43,400
-[Gob] There it is.
-We've got an opportunity

376
00:15:43,484 --> 00:15:45,903
to save the company.
That would not be easy.

377
00:15:46,028 --> 00:15:48,072
That-- that would take sacrifice.

378
00:15:48,155 --> 00:15:50,199
Maybe even burning the...

379
00:15:50,991 --> 00:15:52,743
well, midweek oil.

380
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:54,787
I quit.

381
00:15:55,913 --> 00:15:58,165
I shouldn't have called it
the easy choice.

382
00:15:58,832 --> 00:16:02,294
[Ron] <i>And Oscar and Buster</i> <i>found their way</i>

Now, we cannot draw attention
to ourselves.

386
00:16:10,177 --> 00:16:12,721
-I'm just a guy fixing a broken hand.
-[Oscar] Right.

387
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:16,183

393
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:28,320
No way.

394
00:16:29,238 --> 00:16:31,281
I think I saw William Shatner

-while riding a bicycle once.
-Yeah.

396
00:16:33,784 --> 00:16:36,578
Why don't you try this one? This one.

397
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:38,288
-This one?
-Yeah.

398
00:16:38,372 --> 00:16:40,833
-I think this is used for teaching.
-Doesn't matter. Who cares?

399
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:42,751
[Buster] It sort of reminds me
of Mother's hand,

400
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:45,129
except it's less veiny, and warmer.

401
00:16:45,212 --> 00:16:46,839
All right. All right, you ready?

402
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:50,009
[Ron] <i>Meanwhile, Gob was preparing</i>

[Gob] This is just as tough for you
as it is for me.

405
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:57,182
Tougher, maybe.

406

407
00:17:01,937 --> 00:17:03,731
Oh, God.

408
00:17:04,106 --> 00:17:05,733
I'm gonna miss this view.

409
00:17:06,233 --> 00:17:07,943
Rite Aid roof as far as you can see.

410
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:10,696
[Adhir] Okay, yes, well, anyway,
why don't we go over some expenses?

411
00:17:11,488 --> 00:17:14,199
Yes, yes, thank you
for reminding me. I, um...

412
00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:16,535
[clears throat]
...I told some paid protesters

413
00:17:16,618 --> 00:17:19,038
that we use that, um, they could bill us.

414
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:22,124
You know,
it's for my nephew. Um...

415
00:17:22,207 --> 00:17:24,084
They're gonna be buying
some masks as well, so...

416
00:17:24,168 --> 00:17:25,294
They're Guy Fawkeses.

417
00:17:25,377 --> 00:17:27,046
So those are personal expenses.

418
00:17:27,129 --> 00:17:30,299
No, I just told you,
they're for my nephew. D...

419
00:17:30,841 --> 00:17:33,385
Got it. I'll let Michael know
they're non-business related.

420
00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:34,762
[Gob] Don't worry about Michael.

421
00:17:34,845 --> 00:17:36,430
He should've thought of that
before he fired me.

422
00:17:36,847 --> 00:17:38,640
Probably for being gay, too.

423
00:17:38,932 --> 00:17:41,560
You do know
that Michael didn't fire you, you quit.

424
00:17:41,643 --> 00:17:44,521
As any proud gay man would do
in the face of such bigotry.

425
00:17:46,106 --> 00:17:48,984
But I guess I don't need to tell that
to a little Indian guy, huh?

426
00:17:49,443 --> 00:17:51,111
Michael's not your friend either.

427
00:17:51,195 --> 00:17:52,488
You should've seen
the look on his face

428
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:54,573
when I do my impression
of you. You know...

429
00:17:54,656 --> 00:17:55,991
[Indian accent]
What's the problem with Apu?

430
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:58,202
Just one more thing
before I have security drag you out.

431
00:17:58,619 --> 00:18:00,162
Why are you claiming that

432
00:18:00,245 --> 00:18:02,831
the closet conversion company
was a religious write-off?

433
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:04,625
Because I went there to become straight.

434
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:06,126
I thought it was one
of those Christian places

435
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:08,045
that converts gay men and is, uh...

436
00:18:08,128 --> 00:18:09,755
Now the sole province

437
00:18:09,838 --> 00:18:11,840
of extreme fundamentalist
Christian derangement.

438
00:18:12,633 --> 00:18:14,968
Oh, you're just mad
'cause you can't have a hamburger.

439
00:18:15,385 --> 00:18:16,428
But, yes.

440
00:18:17,054 --> 00:18:20,057
Those places don't work.
There's no such thing as a program

441
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:22,267
that can change someone.
It's a way for hypocrites

442
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:23,268
to try to convince the world

443
00:18:23,352 --> 00:18:26,355
-that they're now straight.
-[Gob] Without using magic.

444
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:29,900
So I just tell the world that I'm gay,
and that I'm going to one of those?

445
00:18:29,983 --> 00:18:31,902
And then I come out straight.

446
00:18:31,985 --> 00:18:34,321
Mm, well, if you really do identify
as a gay man,

447
00:18:34,404 --> 00:18:37,825
I would say going to a place like that
will only make you miserable.

448
00:18:37,908 --> 00:18:39,618
So, shall I arrange an Uber for you?

449
00:18:44,748 --> 00:18:47,334
I didn't understand a word
you just said, little guy.

450
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:49,211
[Ron] <i>But George Michael, meanwhile,</i>

The Guy Fawkeses.

460
00:19:10,774 --> 00:19:12,693
Really? That sounded like you.

461
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,612
Think so?
God, they can even do that now.

462
00:19:16,238 --> 00:19:18,866
Well, all the more reason
to not get you mixed up in all this.

463
00:19:18,949 --> 00:19:22,161
You know, online hacking I can deal with,
it's just the day that they show up

464
00:19:22,244 --> 00:19:23,453
in person that I'm dreading.

465
00:19:23,871 --> 00:19:26,623
But you can't live in fear, so...
let's go.

466

00:20:01,116 --> 00:20:03,076
Hey, guy, I wouldn't know about that.

484
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,578
-We can pretend we're cousins.
-Cousins?

485
00:20:04,661 --> 00:20:05,787
-[laughing]
-[Oscar] Yes.

486
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:08,457
Yeah, Cousin Stan, let's walk, okay?

487
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:09,666
Inside, outside,

488
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:11,043
inside, outside...

489
00:20:11,126 --> 00:20:13,170
Right behind you, cousin-father.

490
00:20:13,253 --> 00:20:16,632
-[grunts, moans]
-[Oscar and Stan laughing]

491
00:20:17,507 --> 00:20:19,718
[Ron] <i>And George Michael</i>
<i>arrived at Fakeblock,</i>

492
00:20:19,801 --> 00:20:22,179
<i>ready to act afraid of the Guy Fawkeses.</i>

493
00:20:22,804 --> 00:20:25,224
-[man 1] When do we want it?
-[man 2] Stop tracking us!

494
00:20:25,307 --> 00:20:28,352
-[man 3] Make a chain!
-[George Michael] This is all on me.

495
00:20:28,685 --> 00:20:30,562
-[man 4] We're still protesting!
-[Rebel] Oh.

496
00:20:30,646 --> 00:20:33,523
You hired a bunch
of foxy guys to protest me

497
00:20:33,607 --> 00:20:36,652
because I said I hated hot guys. [laughs]

498
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:38,695
"Rebel." "Unfair."

499
00:20:38,779 --> 00:20:40,739
-I was reading that as rebel.
-[man 5] Oh, my God,

500
00:20:40,822 --> 00:20:43,659
-it's Rebel Alley. We love you.
-[man 6] Oh.

501
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:45,244
Yes, I went as you
for Halloween last year.

502
00:20:45,327 --> 00:20:47,120
-Can we get a picture?
-[man 4] Do you mind?

503
00:20:47,204 --> 00:20:48,664
<i>Dangerous Cousins</i>
is my favorite movie.

504
00:20:48,747 --> 00:20:50,624
-Mine t--
-[man 5] I will.

505
00:20:50,707 --> 00:20:52,751
I want to see everything else
you've got inside. Come on.

506
00:20:52,834 --> 00:20:53,919
Might not be anybody in there.

507
00:20:54,294 --> 00:20:56,129
They wouldn't have crossed
the picket lines.

508
00:20:56,213 --> 00:20:58,131
Oh, well, you never know with nerds.
Come on.

509
00:20:58,465 --> 00:21:00,259
[George Michael] If you want to see a big
empty room, we'll take a look,

510
00:21:00,342 --> 00:21:03,095
but uh, just... I just know my guys.

511
00:21:03,178 --> 00:21:06,014
[Ron] <i>But George Michael</i>
<i>was in for another surprise.</i>

512
00:21:07,224 --> 00:21:09,434
[clears throat] Yeah.

513
00:21:09,518 --> 00:21:13,689
[Rebel] Oh, my goodness.
Fakeblock is so impressive.

514
00:21:13,772 --> 00:21:15,691
-Yeah.
-I mean, Fakeblock's incredible.

515
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:17,734
-Fakeblock is--
-Yeah, Fakeblock is real.

516
00:21:18,443 --> 00:21:19,528
[Rebel chuckles]

517
00:21:20,737 --> 00:21:21,905
It's my place.

518
00:21:23,156 --> 00:21:25,617
[Ron] <i>And back at the cottage,</i>
<i>Lucille was in</i>

519
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:27,536
<i>for a surprise as well.</i>

520
00:21:29,162 --> 00:21:32,666
Lucille,<i> </i>my lady, my love.

521
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:34,835
Do you remember our first date,

522
00:21:34,918 --> 00:21:36,920
at that little Italian restaurant?

523
00:21:37,004 --> 00:21:38,755
Do you remember what I said to you?

524
00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:41,133
"How did I ever find you?"

525
00:21:41,633 --> 00:21:46,722
<i>âª How did I ever find you? âª</i>

526
00:21:48,598 --> 00:21:52,185
You took me for Chinese.
The Italian place was the first time

527
00:21:52,269 --> 00:21:55,355
I caught you with your secretary,
and you asked,

528
00:21:55,439 --> 00:21:57,316
"How did you ever find <i>me?"</i>

529
00:21:57,649 --> 00:22:01,778
<i>âª How did you ever find me? âª</i>

530
00:22:01,862 --> 00:22:03,989
That's it. All right. Get out.

531
00:22:04,072 --> 00:22:05,615
Go back to the Macaroni Grill.

532
00:22:06,283 --> 00:22:09,077
I, uh, also brought you some leftovers.

533
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:11,955
I'm busy, George. What do you want?

534
00:22:15,208 --> 00:22:16,460
I want you, Lucille.

535
00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:18,879
In what way, George?

536
00:22:19,421 --> 00:22:20,464
Sexually?

537
00:22:20,547 --> 00:22:21,465
Yes.

538
00:22:21,923 --> 00:22:23,342
Sexual-ish-ly.

539
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,178
Look, here's the deal. [chuckles]

540
00:22:27,262 --> 00:22:29,890
-I can't... get hard. I...
-Live without me.

541
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:33,018
It's really getting hard,
uh, to live without you.

542
00:22:34,144 --> 00:22:36,938
We really need each other right now,
because Buster

543
00:22:37,022 --> 00:22:39,691
is on the lam. His first prison break.

544
00:22:39,775 --> 00:22:41,318
I remember when he just started talking.

545
00:22:41,401 --> 00:22:43,320
He better not have started talking.

546
00:22:43,403 --> 00:22:46,365
No, I meant originally.
Like, when he was three.

547
00:22:46,448 --> 00:22:48,200
-Five.
-Five.

548
00:22:48,283 --> 00:22:49,993
He didn't say a word
until we fired the wet nurse.

549
00:22:50,077 --> 00:22:52,871
He didn't stop talking
about that for three years.

550
00:22:52,954 --> 00:22:56,500
-Until we caved.
-You see, this is the stuff.

551
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,835
That makes life worth living?

552
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:01,838
I was actually gonna say
that we should keep from the DA,

553
00:23:01,922 --> 00:23:04,591
but can you tell me
why life is worth living again?

554
00:23:05,008 --> 00:23:06,843
See, that's just it.

555
00:23:06,927 --> 00:23:09,888
-I'm trying to have some kind of a life.
-Mm.

556
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:12,724
With Dustin Radler, the beach rat.

557
00:23:13,016 --> 00:23:14,726
What's the deal?
You in love with this guy?

558
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:16,895
-We're having fun, George.
-[chuckles]

559
00:23:16,978 --> 00:23:18,688
Because he's fun.

560
00:23:18,772 --> 00:23:21,441
He loves music, he plays me songs
on the guitar.

561
00:23:21,566 --> 00:23:22,442
You know, hey,

562
00:23:22,609 --> 00:23:25,195
I just brought the assistant manager

563
00:23:25,278 --> 00:23:28,865
of the Macaroni Grill
over here during his lunch shift.

564
00:23:28,949 --> 00:23:30,534
It set me back a sawbuck.

565
00:23:30,617 --> 00:23:34,121
It's a third of what you are giving me
to live off these days.

566
00:23:34,204 --> 00:23:37,332
Yeah, that's another thing
Dusty doesn't complain about,

567
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:38,417
his allowance.

568
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,252
You give him an allowance?

569
00:23:40,335 --> 00:23:42,838
He doesn't get one. He's very wealthy.

570
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:44,923
He made a lot of money
in his law career.

571
00:23:45,006 --> 00:23:47,509
And he's fun. He surfs.

572
00:23:47,592 --> 00:23:51,430
-He does things. He's alive, George.
-[laughs]

573
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:53,390
I'm alive.

574
00:23:53,473 --> 00:23:55,642
Only because Michael drives
an electric car.

575
00:23:56,017 --> 00:24:00,647
Trust me, the whole
"trying to kill yourself" thing, turn off.

576
00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:02,315
I think I need to show you

577
00:24:02,399 --> 00:24:06,570
that I am a fun guy who likes to laugh

578
00:24:06,653 --> 00:24:09,990
and is open to not killing himself.

579
00:24:10,073 --> 00:24:12,242
I don't call it that,
I call it "a cry for help,"

580
00:24:12,325 --> 00:24:14,828
but I think help has just arrived
and it's saying,

581
00:24:14,911 --> 00:24:17,956
-"Cry for fun!"
-Don't cry at all.

582
00:24:18,039 --> 00:24:20,375
Don't cry. Don't die.

583
00:24:20,876 --> 00:24:22,586
And have some fun.

584
00:24:23,128 --> 00:24:25,088
[laughing] Wow, thank you.

585
00:24:25,172 --> 00:24:27,132
Okay, I'm gonna...
I'm gonna go to the beach now.

586
00:24:27,215 --> 00:24:31,011
I'm gonna have a ball!

587
00:24:32,971 --> 00:24:35,390
I don't know what's going on,
but I feel like a 55-year-old.

588
00:24:35,474 --> 00:24:37,517
Well, so do I.

589
00:24:37,601 --> 00:24:39,728
And he's showing up to take me
out for dinner later,

590
00:24:39,811 --> 00:24:41,188
so I need to get ready.

591
00:24:42,022 --> 00:24:45,984
Okay. Well... don't cry.

592
00:24:46,651 --> 00:24:49,571
Don't die. And have some fun.

593
00:24:50,489 --> 00:24:53,366
Hurt people, hurt people.
