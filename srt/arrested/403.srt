I am real to you.

And this bag next to me,
it is as real as you or me.

No, I know that one's real.

13

the Louis Vuitton.

It was an accident.
This is ridiculous!

If I'd told them we were taking
a bunch of gays out there

54
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:14,917

Yeah, I don't think your record

75
00:02:56,875 --> 00:02:59,041
No, Lindsay, you're going
to the wrong area.

76
00:02:59,083 --> 00:03:01,792
Kenny, Chet, Curtis, Mike,
Bix and Gator are over here.

77
00:03:01,834 --> 00:03:04,625

-Michael?
-Michael. Yes.

81
00:03:12,041 --> 00:03:14,959
Sorry. I was thinking
of Mike, the hot seaman.

00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,125
-No, where is Michael?
-It doesn't matter.

83
00:03:17,166 --> 00:03:18,333
He's not my brother.

00:03:18,375 --> 00:03:19,792
This isn't my family.

Yes! Got my yes.
I got that big yes.

87
00:03:24,667 --> 00:03:27,792
I've spent years trying
to fit into this family,

88
00:03:27,834 --> 00:03:29,125
and it's not me.

89
00:03:29,166 --> 00:03:31,625
My life is a fallacy.

Where's that from?

94
00:03:41,125 --> 00:03:42,750
NARRATOR:
<i>It's from nothing.</i>

95
00:03:42,792 --> 00:03:45,000
<i>But it made her</i>
<i>realize this, too.</i>

96
00:03:45,041 --> 00:03:47,834
I don't know if there's
a right time to say this,

97
00:03:47,875 --> 00:03:51,125
but this marriage of ours,
it hasn't been working.

98
00:03:51,166 --> 00:03:55,250
Yeah... there's nothing

the same thing.

-Yeah, we should end it.
-Let's give it another shot.

00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:34,291
Oh, yes.
Did you want the deep wisdom

169
00:06:34,333 --> 00:06:35,709
or just a light ego cleanse?

170
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:37,125
We do those by the pool.

171
00:06:37,166 --> 00:06:38,959
-There's a pool?
-WOMAN: It's hard to tell

172
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,709
because there are
so many people in it,

173
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:42,792
but yes, it is a pool.

174
00:06:42,834 --> 00:06:44,208
Well, yeah, by the pool, then.

175
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:46,333
And, uh, do you think
you can get someone

176
00:06:46,375 --> 00:06:49,291
to remove the smell of lamb
from my room?

177
00:06:49,333 --> 00:06:51,625
Of course. And which
animal smell would you prefer?

178
00:06:51,667 --> 00:06:53,625
Which do you prefer?

179
00:06:53,667 --> 00:06:55,625
NARRATOR:
<i>But at her 3:00 p.m. shaman...</i>

180
00:06:55,667 --> 00:06:58,083
You are living a life
without love.

181
00:06:58,125 --> 00:07:00,125
<i>-Lindsay got a deeper treatment</i>
-How do I learn to...

182
00:07:00,166 --> 00:07:01,709
<i>-than she had hoped for. </i>
-be happy?

183
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:03,250
You know, to love?

184
00:07:03,291 --> 00:07:06,625
When love is near your heart,
you'll be happy.

185
00:07:06,667 --> 00:07:09,709
You must live life truthfully.

186
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:12,834
Yeah, no, I-I-I do live
truthfully,

187
00:07:12,875 --> 00:07:14,625
but, uh... (sighs)

188
00:07:14,667 --> 00:07:17,000
I'm just so full of passion.

189
00:07:17,041 --> 00:07:19,041
You are so full of (bleep).

190
00:07:19,083 --> 00:07:20,625
Yeah, yeah.

191
00:07:20,667 --> 00:07:22,750
Although, in my culture,
"full of (bleep)"

192
00:07:22,792 --> 00:07:24,125
is kind of like a dig.

193
00:07:24,166 --> 00:07:26,166
I mean, you'd never say it
to a customer.

194
00:07:26,208 --> 00:07:28,250
But, uh, yeah, no,
I-I know what you mean.

195
00:07:28,291 --> 00:07:31,250
This bag is as fake as you are.

196
00:07:31,291 --> 00:07:33,375
(sighs)
Well, how do I learn?

197
00:07:33,417 --> 00:07:34,917
Just look at the spelling.

198
00:07:34,959 --> 00:07:36,250
God. No, I...

199
00:07:36,291 --> 00:07:38,333
Pull your head out of the sand.

200
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:40,834
Love is where you left it.

201
00:07:40,875 --> 00:07:43,208
You mean... back home?

202
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:44,667
God.

203
00:07:44,709 --> 00:07:46,625
The only person back home
is Tobias.

204
00:07:46,667 --> 00:07:48,875
You have no children?

205
00:07:48,917 --> 00:07:51,125
NARRATOR:<i> Lindsay thought</i>
<i>she was being hit on.</i>

206
00:07:51,166 --> 00:07:53,792
No. Why do you ask?

207
00:07:53,834 --> 00:07:56,125
Wait a minute.
You're saying I've come

208
00:07:56,166 --> 00:07:58,000
halfway around the world
to find out

209
00:07:58,041 --> 00:07:59,625
I need to go back home?

210
00:07:59,667 --> 00:08:02,041
God, I haven't even gone
to the beach yet.

211
00:08:02,083 --> 00:08:06,000
NARRATOR:<i> She had. It was just</i>
<i>too crowded to see the water.</i>

212
00:08:06,041 --> 00:08:08,875
<i>It was a moving experience,</i>

213
00:08:08,917 --> 00:08:11,041
<i>but after leaving the tent,</i>
<i>it wasn't just</i>

214
00:08:11,083 --> 00:08:13,250
<i>the shaman's words</i>
<i>that got through to her.</i>

215
00:08:13,291 --> 00:08:14,792
<i>It was this.</i>

216
00:08:14,834 --> 00:08:16,709
I'm sorry.
Your AmEx was declined.

217
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:17,959
Your account is maxed out.

218
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,959
We had to cancel
your shaman appointment.

219
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,792
No, no, I just talked
to the shaman,

220
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:23,333
just right back at...

221
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:26,959
MAN:
Get out! Get out!

222
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,625
Go away! Get out!
Get out! Get out!

223
00:08:29,667 --> 00:08:33,959
I'm sorry to yell at you,
but as I said, it was declined.

224
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,375
So get out.

225
00:08:36,417 --> 00:08:38,375
NARRATOR:
<i>But, fortunately, the universe</i>

226
00:08:38,417 --> 00:08:40,625
<i>offered a solution</i>
<i>to her financial problem</i>

227
00:08:40,667 --> 00:08:43,834
<i>that wasn't too far off</i>
<i>from what her shaman had said.</i>

228
00:08:43,875 --> 00:08:45,959
LUCILLE (over phone):<i> Oh, I've</i>
<i>got money for you, sweetie,</i>

229
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,375
<i>but it means my loving daughter</i>
<i>smiling next to her husband</i>

230
00:08:48,417 --> 00:08:50,041
<i>sitting behind me at the trial.</i>

231
00:08:50,083 --> 00:08:51,417
LINDSAY:
Would you take a grimace?

232
00:08:53,083 --> 00:08:55,125
NARRATOR:<i> So it was with</i>
<i>this dual intention</i>

233
00:08:55,166 --> 00:08:59,000
<i>that she reached out</i>
<i>to a husband she'd left behind,</i>

234
00:08:59,041 --> 00:09:01,667
<i>with a new sense</i>
<i>of inner peace.</i>

235
00:09:01,709 --> 00:09:03,125
<i>Of course, there was still</i>
<i>some outer stuff</i>

236
00:09:03,166 --> 00:09:04,625
<i>she needed to work through.</i>

237
00:09:04,667 --> 00:09:05,834
(over phone):
Hello. It's Tobias.

238
00:09:05,875 --> 00:09:07,041
-Leave a message.
-(beep)

239
00:09:07,083 --> 00:09:08,417
I'm ready to make this work.

240
00:09:11,041 --> 00:09:13,625
NARRATOR:<i> It was with a sense</i>
<i>of enlightenment that Lindsay</i>

241
00:09:13,667 --> 00:09:15,834
<i>returned from her</i>
<i>spiritual journey...</i>

242
00:09:15,875 --> 00:09:18,250
...to get her hands on
the stimulus money, too, right?

243
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:19,792
Stop with the prayer hands.

244
00:09:19,834 --> 00:09:21,458
It just looks
like you're out of ideas.

245
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:23,667
Seriously, shoot me
if you ever catch me doing that.

246
00:09:23,709 --> 00:09:25,417
Says the least spiritual
man I know.

247
00:09:25,458 --> 00:09:27,583
MICHAEL: What deal
did you strike with her?

248
00:09:27,625 --> 00:09:30,125
What part of her soul
did you buy?

249
00:09:30,166 --> 00:09:31,625
All I've asked
is that she testify

250
00:09:31,667 --> 00:09:34,458
that I was a wonderful mother
who did her best.

251
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:35,834
So all of it.

252
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:38,125
No, Michael.
I'm not a whore.

253
00:09:38,166 --> 00:09:39,458
I don't get any of the money

254
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:40,875
until after I do
the disgusting thing.

255
00:09:40,917 --> 00:09:43,166
But I'm not here
just for the stimmy.

256
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:44,667
I'm here
because a shaman told me

257
00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:46,792
that love is where I left it.

258
00:09:46,834 --> 00:09:48,667
Which, after much soul searching

259
00:09:48,709 --> 00:09:52,500
and by process of elimination,
is Tobias.

260
00:09:52,542 --> 00:09:54,625
TOBIAS:
I got the part.

261
00:09:56,166 --> 00:09:57,625
NARRATOR:
<i>And so Lindsay and Tobias</i>

262
00:09:57,667 --> 00:10:00,417
<i>took another shot</i>
<i>at being husband and wife,</i>

263
00:10:00,458 --> 00:10:02,208
<i>and although they wouldn't</i>
<i>have money</i>

264
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:04,625
<i>until after the perjury,</i>
<i>they set about</i>

265
00:10:04,667 --> 00:10:06,667
<i>-buying a home. </i>
-Are you ready to make a move?

266
00:10:06,709 --> 00:10:10,625
As you can see,
I'm ready for a lot that's new.

267
00:10:10,667 --> 00:10:12,792
Oh! Good heavens!

268
00:10:12,834 --> 00:10:14,125
Right!

269
00:10:14,166 --> 00:10:15,583
Well, this is a great area.

270
00:10:15,625 --> 00:10:17,291
There's some wonderful
surgi-centers nearby.

271
00:10:17,333 --> 00:10:19,458
We're doing it.
We're really doing this.

272
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,500
Yes! We're gonna get you
in the right house.

273
00:10:21,542 --> 00:10:24,000
And it's just the two of you?
You have no children?

274
00:10:24,041 --> 00:10:25,750
We don't.

275
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:27,750
TOBIAS:
We should be honest here.

276
00:10:27,792 --> 00:10:29,542
We have no income flow.

277
00:10:29,583 --> 00:10:30,875
No incoming income flow.

278
00:10:30,917 --> 00:10:32,417
We have plenty
of outgoing income.

279
00:10:32,458 --> 00:10:34,166
No savings, no credit.

280
00:10:34,208 --> 00:10:36,458
I mean, we had some stimmy,

281
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:38,208
but that went
to his hospital bills.

282
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:40,250
But there's one thing
we do have--

283
00:10:40,291 --> 00:10:41,250
Work ethic!

284
00:10:41,291 --> 00:10:42,542
Right. No work ethic.

285
00:10:42,583 --> 00:10:43,709
But there's one thing
we do have--

286
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:45,625
we do have a daughter.

287
00:10:45,667 --> 00:10:48,458
I was just on auto-pilot
before, when I said we didn't.

288
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:49,834
I should have caught that;
yeah, but...

289
00:10:49,875 --> 00:10:51,458
MAEBY:
I could've spoken up,

290
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,500
but I just wanted to see
if you guys got there.

291
00:10:53,542 --> 00:10:55,166
Well, you guys seem like
a great family.

292
00:10:55,208 --> 00:10:56,792
We have to be realistic.

293
00:10:56,834 --> 00:10:58,333
I'm in the real estate business.

294
00:10:58,375 --> 00:11:00,166
It's 2006.

295
00:11:00,208 --> 00:11:02,250
That's all good enough for me.

296
00:11:02,291 --> 00:11:03,667
We're gonna put you
in a NINJA loan.

297
00:11:03,709 --> 00:11:05,750
"No income, no jobs,
no assets."

298
00:11:05,792 --> 00:11:07,542
And you don't have to pay
a penny for two years.

299
00:11:07,583 --> 00:11:09,166
Oh, NINJA! Please!

300
00:11:09,208 --> 00:11:10,792
So we'll take something
cozy and intimate.

301
00:11:10,834 --> 00:11:13,333
-A one-bedroom.
-Or bigger.

302
00:11:13,375 --> 00:11:14,542
Yeah, how about something nice?
A three-bedroom?

303
00:11:14,583 --> 00:11:15,625
LINDSAY:
Three does sound bigger.

304
00:11:15,667 --> 00:11:17,166
Oh, it definitely is.

305
00:11:17,208 --> 00:11:19,000
NARRATOR:<i> You have to remember</i>
<i>that this was a time</i>

306
00:11:19,041 --> 00:11:21,542
<i>when banks were eager to create</i>
<i>as much debt as possible.</i>

307
00:11:21,583 --> 00:11:23,375
...the five-bedroom,
four-car garage.

308
00:11:23,417 --> 00:11:25,792
And I know that you guys
are going to be okay

309
00:11:25,834 --> 00:11:27,458
with just one master bathroom,

310
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:30,166
because a lot of people
do prefer two.

311
00:11:30,208 --> 00:11:32,291
You know, they like
to just have it.

312
00:11:32,333 --> 00:11:33,792
Maybe separate, so we have it.

313
00:11:33,834 --> 00:11:35,375
So we have it.
That way we have it.

314
00:11:35,417 --> 00:11:36,417
That way you have it.

315
00:11:36,458 --> 00:11:37,625
Do you think
we really need one?

316
00:11:37,667 --> 00:11:38,750
I'm just gonna
interrupt for a second.

317
00:11:38,792 --> 00:11:41,291
You don't need a wine cellar,

318
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:43,792
if you want to do wine tastings
in your butler's kitchen.

319
00:11:43,834 --> 00:11:45,792
I mean, this really isn't
what we discussed.

320
00:11:45,834 --> 00:11:48,750
Well, we didn't discuss
any of this, but, uh...

321
00:11:48,792 --> 00:11:51,125
yes, uh, I guess, that way,
we... we have it.

322
00:11:51,166 --> 00:11:52,458
Well... yeah...

323
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,583
That way,
you'll definitely have it.

324
00:11:54,625 --> 00:11:57,375
<i>And then once you have it,</i>
<i>that way, you'll have it.</i>

325
00:11:57,417 --> 00:11:59,000
But do we need a gatehouse?

326
00:11:59,041 --> 00:12:03,834
I just put John Beard into a
house with a double gatehouse.

327
00:12:03,875 --> 00:12:05,417
Now, that's John Beard;
he's on television.

328
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:06,834
No one's gonna look down on you

329
00:12:06,875 --> 00:12:08,792
just 'cause you have less
than John Beard.

330
00:12:08,834 --> 00:12:10,625
-Is this crazy?
-I think so.

331
00:12:10,667 --> 00:12:12,208
We'll take
the double gatehouse.

332
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:13,750
Oh, is that what you thought?
Because...

333
00:12:13,792 --> 00:12:15,417
-Well, that way, we'll have it.
-We have it. We have it.

334
00:12:15,458 --> 00:12:17,125
And that way, you have it.

335
00:12:17,166 --> 00:12:18,125
<i>There was a lot of this</i>

<i>And soon, they were</i>

338
00:12:21,875 --> 00:12:25,208
-Good point!

LINDSAY:
<i>Mother's Day Eve</i>

340
00:12:27,041 --> 00:12:29,250
was the most joyous day
of the year.

341
00:12:29,291 --> 00:12:31,542

be late for school.

NARRATOR:<i> And what they lost</i>
<i>in coziness...</i>

343
00:12:33,583 --> 00:12:35,125
God, they grow up so slowly.

00:12:35,166 --> 00:12:38,208
<i>...they made up for in</i>
<i>cavernous, unfurnished space.</i>

345
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:41,542
-And the robot's dead again.
-Oh! Poor little guy.

346
00:12:41,583 --> 00:12:45,542

<i>With her mother's</i>
<i>trial coming up,</i>

349
00:12:48,834 --> 00:12:52,083
<i>Lindsay made an effort</i>

350
00:12:52,125 --> 00:12:53,542
...when I was hungry, I...

351
00:12:53,583 --> 00:12:55,750
-(Lindsay laughs)
-Go on.

352
00:12:55,792 --> 00:12:58,166
You don't want me to say
this next part, do you?

353
00:12:58,208 --> 00:12:59,875
I think it tells the story.

354
00:12:59,917 --> 00:13:03,000
But am I
accidentally being funny,

355
00:13:03,041 --> 00:13:05,542
or am I purposely being funny?

356
00:13:05,583 --> 00:13:06,917
It's not supposed to be funny.

357
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:09,625
"Suckled at her champagne
glass breasts"?

358
00:13:09,667 --> 00:13:10,667
Is it a joke?

359
00:13:10,709 --> 00:13:11,875
Buster wrote it.

360
00:13:11,917 --> 00:13:13,291
Recently?

361
00:13:13,333 --> 00:13:15,583
I adapted it from a letter
he wrote from camp.

362
00:13:15,625 --> 00:13:16,959
I miss you, Mommy.

363
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,542
Camp is scary at times.

364
00:13:18,583 --> 00:13:20,166
When I was cold, you clothed me,

365
00:13:20,208 --> 00:13:21,750
when I was hungry...

366
00:13:21,792 --> 00:13:24,208
Uh, how do I say this?

367
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:27,750
Suckled at your champagne
glass breasts.

368
00:13:27,792 --> 00:13:29,041
Oh, that's good.

369
00:13:29,083 --> 00:13:30,875
It doesn't matter.
I'll be proofing it, anyway.

370
00:13:30,917 --> 00:13:32,125
LINDSAY:
<i>Oh, God.</i>

371
00:13:32,166 --> 00:13:34,792
This is from
Camp Kiss-A-Me-Mommy?

372
00:13:34,834 --> 00:13:36,917
Just read the copy.
You're getting paid for this.

373
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:38,000
No. You know what?

374
00:13:38,041 --> 00:13:39,166
The money is not
important to me.

375
00:13:39,208 --> 00:13:40,792
My shaman said...

376
00:13:40,834 --> 00:13:43,917
Oh, don't give me that
mystical nonsense.

377
00:13:43,959 --> 00:13:45,417
You think you're
better than I am.

378
00:13:45,458 --> 00:13:48,583
But you're a lot more like me
than you think you are.

379
00:13:48,625 --> 00:13:51,041
Now, let's take it from:

380
00:13:51,083 --> 00:13:53,917
"I hope she gives me
bubble baths forever."

381
00:13:53,959 --> 00:13:56,000
And I want to smell the suds.

382
00:13:56,041 --> 00:13:58,208
<i>But worse news was</i>

I mean, this works, right?

397
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:25,875
Never better.

398
00:14:28,542 --> 00:14:30,917
<i>And the week</i>

What's this?
Mother's not going to pay?

401
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:37,667
She actually said
she'd only pay me

402
00:14:37,709 --> 00:14:39,125
if my testimony is believable.

403
00:14:39,166 --> 00:14:40,750
Lindsay! Lindsay!

404
00:14:40,792 --> 00:14:42,166
...but how am I supposed
to say something like

405
00:14:42,208 --> 00:14:43,166
"I love you, Mother!"

406
00:14:43,208 --> 00:14:45,500
and sound believable?

407
00:14:45,542 --> 00:14:47,792
Well, geez... Jesus C. Penny!

408
00:14:47,834 --> 00:14:49,667
You know,
I wish I had the luxury

409
00:14:49,709 --> 00:14:51,208
of not sounding believable.

410
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:54,083
But that's not an option for
an out-of-work actor, is it?

411
00:14:54,125 --> 00:14:56,500
Or it's why you're out of work!

412
00:14:56,542 --> 00:14:59,917
Well, I beg one's pardon,
but I have been dying to go

413
00:14:59,959 --> 00:15:02,834
to that Method Acting Clinic
that I see on my nightly drives,

414
00:15:02,875 --> 00:15:04,500
but you won't let me!

415
00:15:04,542 --> 00:15:06,667
Because you already
wasted all that money

416
00:15:06,709 --> 00:15:09,000
on Carl Weathers'
Master Acting Class.

417
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:12,083
Well, I'm sorry,
but I'm such a star (bleep)

418
00:15:12,125 --> 00:15:15,000
that I didn't pay attention
to anything he said!

419
00:15:15,041 --> 00:15:18,250
Oh, well then, maybe I should go
to your Method Acting Class,

420
00:15:18,291 --> 00:15:20,500
to make my testimony
more believable!

421
00:15:20,542 --> 00:15:21,834
That's actually a good idea.

422
00:15:21,875 --> 00:15:24,166
Maybe you could--
Oh! Hi. Yes.

423
00:15:24,208 --> 00:15:26,792
Well, perhaps we should
go together.

424
00:15:26,834 --> 00:15:30,000
Yeah. Might be good
for us, as a couple.

425
00:15:30,041 --> 00:15:31,959
I do hope so.

426
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,083
I really want
to make this work.

427
00:15:34,125 --> 00:15:35,917
Me, too.

428
00:15:35,959 --> 00:15:38,166
I really love you, Tobias.

429
00:15:38,208 --> 00:15:40,000
Oh, Lindsay, we have

430
00:15:40,041 --> 00:15:42,750
got to get you to
that acting clinic.

431
00:15:42,792 --> 00:15:45,500
And that was with me
picturing fudge.

432
00:15:45,542 --> 00:15:46,917
Fudge.

<i>Lindsay had decided to attend</i>

This is the first time

437
00:16:00,208 --> 00:16:01,500
I've actually done something
like this with you.

438
00:16:01,542 --> 00:16:03,417
I think I always
kind of looked down on it.

439
00:16:03,458 --> 00:16:05,375
You know, Lindsay, I think
you'll find that

440
00:16:05,417 --> 00:16:07,709
some of what used to seem
clueless about me

441
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:10,375
is actually something
I'm quite good at.

442
00:16:10,417 --> 00:16:13,375
This... is where I belong.

443
00:16:13,417 --> 00:16:15,208
If you're new here,
you need to go to the window.

444
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:16,792
Uh, fill out this form first.

445
00:16:16,834 --> 00:16:19,083
And there's some personal
questions on it, like, uh,

446
00:16:19,125 --> 00:16:20,333
how you first got hooked.

447
00:16:20,375 --> 00:16:21,667
Well, that's an easy one:

448
00:16:21,709 --> 00:16:22,792
<i>You're A Good Man,</i>
<i>Charlie Brown.</i>

449
00:16:22,834 --> 00:16:24,375
(Tobias chuckles)

450
00:16:24,417 --> 00:16:25,625
No, uh, no,<i> Mame.</i>

451
00:16:25,667 --> 00:16:27,041
No, ma'am...?

452
00:16:27,083 --> 00:16:28,375
<i>You're A Good Man...</i>

453
00:16:28,417 --> 00:16:29,750
<i>You're A Good Man,</i>
<i>Charlie Brown.</i>

<i>Gypsy. Gypsy.</i>

455
00:16:31,166 --> 00:16:32,291
CLINICIAN:
Just come up here and be

456
00:16:32,333 --> 00:16:34,208
as truthful as possible.

457
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:37,083
WOMAN: Okay, this is (bleep)
overwhelming.

458
00:16:37,125 --> 00:16:38,500
They're starting the monologues.

459
00:16:38,542 --> 00:16:41,125
I think this is from
<i>Songs for My Father.</i>

460
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:42,291
WOMAN: This (bleep) is
(bleep) up, right?

LINDSAY:
What did you say

462
00:16:43,667 --> 00:16:44,667
the name of this acting class
was again?

463
00:16:44,709 --> 00:16:45,792
TOBIAS:
Method One Clinic.

464
00:16:45,834 --> 00:16:47,750
Okay, I'm gonna go get coffee.

465
00:16:47,792 --> 00:16:50,500
Garden Grove Method One Clinic.

466
00:16:50,542 --> 00:16:52,792
<i>And moments later,</i>

it's (bleep).

471
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:02,417
-I wouldn't...
-(scoffs)

472
00:17:02,458 --> 00:17:04,166
You don't look like a junkie.

473
00:17:04,208 --> 00:17:05,792
You do. What do you weigh,
like, 90 pounds?

475
00:17:07,208 --> 00:17:08,208
That's so funny!

But-but no, no.

478
00:17:11,417 --> 00:17:13,166
If I'm addicted to anything,
it's alcohol.

479
00:17:13,208 --> 00:17:14,500
I'm Lindsay.

480
00:17:14,542 --> 00:17:17,500
And you're... hmm!
"Bitíme."

481
00:17:17,542 --> 00:17:20,166
No, I don't like giving my name
to any state organization,

482
00:17:20,208 --> 00:17:22,125
especially after I got kicked
off the voter rolls,

483
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:24,542
'cause I accidentally signed up
for the wrong political group.

484
00:17:24,583 --> 00:17:26,500
Wow.
What group was that?

485
00:17:26,542 --> 00:17:28,750
You know, I don't even remember.

486
00:17:28,792 --> 00:17:30,709
Just some guy in a booth
on the boardwalk.

487
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:32,500
<i>He joined Al Qaeda.</i>

488
00:17:32,542 --> 00:17:33,542
MAN: And I only signed up
'cause he was giving away

489
00:17:33,583 --> 00:17:35,083
a free beard brush.

490
00:17:35,125 --> 00:17:37,250
<i>...that says "Al Qaeda" on it.</i>

491
00:17:37,291 --> 00:17:40,083
<i>But maybe he thought it was</i>

492
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:41,375
I'm Marky Bark.

493

Of the tree-freer Barks?

494

<i>Marky was the son</i>

LINDSAY:<i> Oh, my God!</i>

498
00:17:51,625 --> 00:17:53,041
I remember thinking, one day,

499
00:17:53,083 --> 00:17:54,500
he was just gonna
fall out of a tree

500
00:17:54,542 --> 00:17:55,500
and break his neck.

501
00:17:55,542 --> 00:17:57,125
Whatever happened to him?

502
00:17:57,166 --> 00:17:58,208
He fell out of a tree
and broke his neck.

503
00:17:58,250 --> 00:17:59,333
Oh, God...

504
00:17:59,375 --> 00:18:00,417
No, I'm just kidding.

505
00:18:00,458 --> 00:18:02,208
-(laughs)
-Oh...

506
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:03,291
So how is he?

507
00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:04,291
Oh, he's dead.

508
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:06,250
But natural causes.

509
00:18:06,291 --> 00:18:07,709
A bunch of deranged bees
chased him out of a tree

510
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:09,041
and he fell to his death.

511
00:18:09,083 --> 00:18:10,375
So, are you here alone, or...?

512
00:18:10,417 --> 00:18:11,542
No, I'm with her.

513
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:14,250
She's a committee member.

514
00:18:14,291 --> 00:18:16,166
Which committee is that?

515
00:18:16,208 --> 00:18:17,542
Itty-bitty (bleep).

516
00:18:17,583 --> 00:18:20,291
What a wonderful sense of humor.

517
00:18:20,333 --> 00:18:22,667
Listen, the only time DeBrie
can keep food down

518
00:18:22,709 --> 00:18:24,208
is for about 20 minutes
after she comes crashing

519
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:25,500
off the methadone, so...

520
00:18:25,542 --> 00:18:27,041
-Oh...
-would you care to join us

521
00:18:27,083 --> 00:18:28,542
as we rustle up some grub

522
00:18:28,583 --> 00:18:30,417
to shove down our mouths?

523
00:18:30,458 --> 00:18:32,208
I would like that very much.

524
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:34,250
<i>So Tobias and Lindsay drove</i>

525
00:18:34,291 --> 00:18:36,333
<i>to meet their</i>
<i>new friends for lunch.</i>

526
00:18:36,375 --> 00:18:38,750
They are such a neat couple!

527
00:18:38,792 --> 00:18:40,542
Aren't they neat!

528
00:18:40,583 --> 00:18:42,125
It's so fun to have another
couple to go out with.

529
00:18:42,166 --> 00:18:43,542
LINDSAY:
He's amazing.

530
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:46,041
I mean, so passionate
about real issues.

531
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:48,208
He's a real activist--
like me.

532
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:51,041
And she's a real actress,
like me!

533
00:18:51,083 --> 00:18:53,041
Oh, she used to be
in big movies,

534
00:18:53,083 --> 00:18:55,208
but then, like a lot of actors,
the teeth go...

535
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:56,333
Mm!

536
00:18:56,375 --> 00:18:57,458
But she is the perfect age

537
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:00,208
to be a Hollywood actress-- 42.

538
00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:01,375
Is that all?

539
00:19:01,417 --> 00:19:02,792
Oh, I think this is the place.

540
00:19:02,834 --> 00:19:05,041
It's a barter restaurant.

541
00:19:05,083 --> 00:19:07,041
Marky doesn't believe in money.

542
00:19:07,083 --> 00:19:08,500
Do I like barter?

543
00:19:08,542 --> 00:19:11,000
No, it means
they don't deal with money.

544
00:19:11,041 --> 00:19:12,667
That's why I swiped
that methadone tray.

545
00:19:12,709 --> 00:19:14,458
Hmm.

546
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:16,667
What interesting friends
we've made.

547
00:19:16,709 --> 00:19:19,625
I think this is exactly
what our marriage needed.

548
00:19:26,458 --> 00:19:28,000
NARRATOR:
<i>Lindsay and Tobias gathered</i>

549
00:19:28,041 --> 00:19:29,333
<i>with their new friends...</i>

550
00:19:29,375 --> 00:19:30,625
WAITRESS: Hi, y'all!
This your first time...?

551
00:19:30,667 --> 00:19:33,208
<i>...at CW Swappigans,</i>

552
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:35,792
<i>a chain that sprung up</i>
<i>after the economic collapse.</i>

553
00:19:35,834 --> 00:19:39,166
We are like a Salvation Army
meets a soup kitchen,

554
00:19:39,208 --> 00:19:40,792
meets a gastro pub,

555
00:19:40,834 --> 00:19:44,250
meets a Marxist- or
Leninist-type social structure.

556
00:19:44,291 --> 00:19:46,083
These are things
that you can order

557
00:19:46,125 --> 00:19:48,083
and these are things
that we will accept.

558
00:19:48,125 --> 00:19:51,208
As you see on the bottom,
we don't have the fish,

559
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:52,750
and we're not taking
any more lava lamps.

560
00:19:52,792 --> 00:19:55,291
Uh-oh!
I can see this one's got

561
00:19:55,333 --> 00:19:56,750
that deer
in the headlights look!

562
00:19:56,792 --> 00:19:59,375
Oh, no.
He just took some methadone.

563
00:19:59,417 --> 00:20:02,375
He thought he was driving,
with a cocktail tray.

564
00:20:02,417 --> 00:20:04,208
Oh, speaking of that...

565
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:06,250
How about mozzarella sticks
for the table?

566
00:20:06,291 --> 00:20:09,375
Cocktail tray, light scratching,
for mozzarella sticks.

567
00:20:09,417 --> 00:20:12,208
Six, no sauce.

568
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:15,208
And maybe some sparkling water
for the table.

569
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:17,375
Oh, I'm sorry, sir. We're no
longer taking hotel soaps.

570
00:20:17,417 --> 00:20:19,041
LINDSAY:
This is fun.

571
00:20:19,083 --> 00:20:21,083
MARKY:
A lot of people couldn't handle

572
00:20:21,125 --> 00:20:22,709
a Dumpster dive
for their first double date.

573
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:25,709
Is that what this is?

574
00:20:27,208 --> 00:20:28,500
Now, wait... wait a second.

575
00:20:28,542 --> 00:20:31,125
I wasn't driving?

576
00:20:31,166 --> 00:20:33,500
It's just so refreshing
to meet people

577
00:20:33,542 --> 00:20:36,542
with real passion
about changing the status quo.

578
00:20:36,583 --> 00:20:40,667
Lindsay and I
don't have a single friend.

579
00:20:40,709 --> 00:20:42,125
Is the food here yet?

580
00:20:42,166 --> 00:20:44,709
I'm not hungry,
but... but, uh...

581
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:47,291
-Oh, look, it's butter.
-MARKY: DeBrie.

582
00:20:47,333 --> 00:20:49,417
(whooping)

583
00:20:49,458 --> 00:20:51,083
MARKY:
DeBrie, that's our butter.

584
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:53,417
We were going to swap it
for dessert.

585
00:20:53,458 --> 00:20:55,458
No, she's improvising.
Uh, yes, ma'am.

586
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:57,417
You seem to be liking
that butter substitute

587
00:20:57,458 --> 00:20:58,625
at Swappigans.

588
00:20:58,667 --> 00:21:00,208
Uh, yes, and...

589
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:02,417
wh-what else could you swap for?

590
00:21:02,458 --> 00:21:05,041
Uh, yes, and... uh...

591
00:21:05,083 --> 00:21:06,333
Oh, I'm out. She's too good.

592
00:21:06,375 --> 00:21:08,041
I... I don't know who my guy is.

593
00:21:08,083 --> 00:21:09,417
I don't... I don't have a guy.

594
00:21:09,458 --> 00:21:10,750
MARKY:
No, she just likes butter.

595
00:21:10,792 --> 00:21:12,542
Come on, let's get you
cleaned up.

596
00:21:12,583 --> 00:21:13,709
-Don't touch anything.
-Marky, I'll take her.

597
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:15,250
You two just got here.

598
00:21:15,291 --> 00:21:17,041
Have a chat about.
I'll clean her up.

599
00:21:17,083 --> 00:21:18,709
-TOBIAS: Come on, DeBrie.
-DeBRIE: Num, num, num, num.

600
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:20,208
-I'm sorry.
-Don't be.

601
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:21,542
I-I love it here.

602
00:21:21,583 --> 00:21:23,792
My mother would hate this place.

603
00:21:23,834 --> 00:21:25,583
You know, Lindsay,
I-I have to tell you,

604
00:21:25,625 --> 00:21:28,041
when I first met you,
I thought you were one of those

605
00:21:28,083 --> 00:21:31,667
typical, uptight, snobby,
Newport Beach,

606
00:21:31,709 --> 00:21:33,709
vapid... nut-busters!

607
00:21:36,125 --> 00:21:37,417
You know, one of those monsters

608
00:21:37,458 --> 00:21:39,041
that lives in
a 10,000-square-foot house

609
00:21:39,083 --> 00:21:40,375
that they destroyed
the wetlands for.

610
00:21:40,417 --> 00:21:42,208
Those were wetlands?

611
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:44,583
(sighs) That explains
our Thanksgiving miracle.

612
00:21:44,625 --> 00:21:46,250
What do you mean,
you didn't make dinner?

613
00:21:46,291 --> 00:21:48,041
I didn't realize
it was Thursday, okay?

614
00:21:48,083 --> 00:21:49,542
There's got to be
something here.

615
00:21:49,583 --> 00:21:51,041
(gasps, screams)

616
00:21:51,083 --> 00:21:52,458
TOBIAS:
Oh! Oh!

617
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:54,291
Oh! Get it! Get it!

618
00:21:54,333 --> 00:21:56,125
Chase it into the oven!

619
00:21:56,166 --> 00:21:58,458
Come on. Come on.
Here, little ducky.

620
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:00,208
-That's a good duck.
-Good duck.

621
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:02,542
-In you go!
-(loud quacking)

622
00:22:02,583 --> 00:22:05,792
This is going to be
the greatest Thanksgiving ever.

623
00:22:05,834 --> 00:22:08,166
It's a miracle!

624
00:22:08,208 --> 00:22:09,792
Well, I actually do live

625
00:22:09,834 --> 00:22:11,625
in a fairly large house
right now.

626
00:22:11,667 --> 00:22:13,333
But we've never made
a payment on it.

627
00:22:13,375 --> 00:22:15,041
So you're sticking it
to Big Banking.

628
00:22:15,083 --> 00:22:17,083
-That's cool.
-Yes.

629
00:22:17,125 --> 00:22:18,625
In fact, I'm only in America

630
00:22:18,667 --> 00:22:20,208
because a shaman told me
that love

631
00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:23,041
would come to me
when I accepted who I am

632
00:22:23,083 --> 00:22:24,750
-and didn't run away.
-Sounds like a good shaman.

633
00:22:24,792 --> 00:22:28,041
Oh, he was the house shaman
at the Four Seasons Mumbai,

634
00:22:28,083 --> 00:22:30,709
so you figure
he's got to be pretty good.

635
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:33,709
Oh, and he turned into
an ostrich at the end, so...

636
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:35,750
They're not going to have that
at the Embassy Suites.

637
00:22:35,792 --> 00:22:39,208
That's funny.
I actually run an ostrich farm.

638
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:43,458
(Indian music playing):
♪ Co... incidence! ♪

639
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:45,458
That's not a coincidence.

640
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:47,792
♪ Yes, it is. ♪

641
00:22:47,834 --> 00:22:50,166
MAN:
Mini pizzas, no pepperoni!

642
00:22:50,208 --> 00:22:51,583
Marky, I've got to tell you,

643
00:22:51,625 --> 00:22:53,291
talking about these
social issues, it's...

644
00:22:53,333 --> 00:22:55,709
the first time I've felt
like myself

645
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:57,500
in a really long time.

646
00:22:57,542 --> 00:23:00,250
That's because I say
what I mean, I do what I feel.

647
00:23:00,291 --> 00:23:01,709
No lies.

648
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:03,250
NARRATOR:
<i>Lindsay felt guilty</i>

649
00:23:03,291 --> 00:23:05,125
<i>because she was about</i>
<i>to go enter</i>

650
00:23:05,166 --> 00:23:07,125
<i>a crab house/courtroom</i>
<i>and do just that.</i>

651
00:23:07,166 --> 00:23:08,500
That's why my motto is:

652
00:23:08,542 --> 00:23:11,375
"Live truthfully
and skate through life."

653
00:23:11,417 --> 00:23:14,375
<i>Marky felt guilty</i>
<i>because it wasn't his motto.</i>

654
00:23:14,417 --> 00:23:17,333
<i>It was the motto of a surf</i>
<i>and skateboard company.</i>

655
00:23:17,375 --> 00:23:18,542
Live truthfully.

656
00:23:18,583 --> 00:23:20,125
Skate through life.

657
00:23:21,250 --> 00:23:22,667
That's amazing.

658
00:23:22,709 --> 00:23:24,333
I haven't felt this deep

659
00:23:24,375 --> 00:23:27,375
a connection with someone
in a long, long time.

660
00:23:31,125 --> 00:23:33,041
Other than DeBrie.

661
00:23:33,083 --> 00:23:34,750
I can't believe
we just did that.

662
00:23:34,792 --> 00:23:36,709
I can't believe how little give
your teeth have.

663
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:39,041
So, where do you keep
your ostriches?

664
00:23:39,083 --> 00:23:40,625
WAITRESS: Sheraton mini soap
for a taco salad?

665
00:23:40,667 --> 00:23:42,083
MAN:
We don't take hotel soap!

666
00:23:42,125 --> 00:23:44,041
<i>And perhaps it was</i>
<i>to get back at her mother...</i>

667
00:23:44,083 --> 00:23:46,375
-Leave a tip! Leave a tip!
<i>-...or to get out of</i>

668
00:23:46,417 --> 00:23:49,166
<i>a relationship that had</i>
<i>been over for a long time,</i>

669

<i>but that's when</i>
<i>Lindsay hopped off</i>

670
00:23:51,208 --> 00:23:54,250
<i>to pursue a life</i>
<i>she felt was her destiny.</i>

671
00:23:54,291 --> 00:23:56,709
<i>And the new lovers</i>
<i>discovered each other.</i>

672
00:23:56,750 --> 00:23:59,208
<i>The beautiful female body,</i>

673
00:23:59,250 --> 00:24:01,333
<i>the horrible male.</i>

674
00:24:07,083 --> 00:24:09,458
Wow. That was so...

675
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:11,417
-fast.
-Thanks.

676
00:24:11,458 --> 00:24:14,041
Well, I didn't know how long
we'd be stuck in traffic, so...

677
00:24:14,083 --> 00:24:15,500
-(horn honking)
-Oh! And it sounds

678
00:24:15,542 --> 00:24:17,667
-like it's moving, so...
-MAN: Move it!

679
00:24:17,709 --> 00:24:18,792
-(horn honking)
-Come on! Come on!

680
00:24:18,834 --> 00:24:21,083
-Let's go!
-Careful!

681
00:24:21,125 --> 00:24:24,375
<i>And as they drove, they learned</i>
<i>so much about each other.</i>

682
00:24:24,417 --> 00:24:26,750
MARKY:<i> I was always just</i>
<i>in such a rush to grow up</i>

683
00:24:26,792 --> 00:24:29,250
and change this world,
and foolishly,

684
00:24:29,291 --> 00:24:31,500
the teeth I pulled
were my adult teeth,

685
00:24:31,542 --> 00:24:34,375
so this guy all the way
to that guy back there,

686
00:24:34,417 --> 00:24:36,667
that's a... just a piece
of wood I stick in there.

687
00:24:36,709 --> 00:24:38,208
I mean, they're just
chewing tools.

688
00:24:38,250 --> 00:24:39,750
(laughs)
I don't care about looks.

689
00:24:39,792 --> 00:24:42,125
But you find me pretty,
though, right?

690
00:24:42,166 --> 00:24:43,375
No.

691
00:24:43,417 --> 00:24:45,166
I have no idea
what you look like.

692
00:24:45,208 --> 00:24:46,792
I have this condition
called face blindness.

693
00:24:46,834 --> 00:24:49,041
I mean, I can tell
you're a woman.

694
00:24:49,083 --> 00:24:50,375
(chuckling):
Oh, stop.

695
00:24:50,417 --> 00:24:52,709
But, honestly, no,
all I see is, like,

696
00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:56,291
eyes and nose, you know,
hair, ears and...

697
00:24:56,333 --> 00:24:58,709
But I can tell you got
a great heart, Lindsay.

698
00:24:58,750 --> 00:25:00,709
I can tell
you've been living a lie.

699
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:03,041
You and I are going to change
this world together.

700
00:25:03,083 --> 00:25:04,250
(Marky whoops, Lindsay laughs)

701
00:25:04,291 --> 00:25:06,542
LINDSAY:
<i>You know, my shaman</i>

702
00:25:06,583 --> 00:25:08,709
told me that I should stop
caring about appearances.

703
00:25:08,750 --> 00:25:12,333
You know, my whole life, that's
all anyone has ever praised.

704
00:25:12,375 --> 00:25:14,709
All my mom ever cared about.

705
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:16,792
Because I'm really pretty.

706
00:25:16,834 --> 00:25:20,250
I just thought I'd tell you that
so the story made sense.

707
00:25:20,291 --> 00:25:23,083
-I don't care.
-But I guess it's kind of karma

708
00:25:23,125 --> 00:25:25,542
that I ended up with someone
who wanted to make love to me

709
00:25:25,583 --> 00:25:27,166
no matter what I look like.

710
00:25:27,208 --> 00:25:29,291
Also wanted to make sure
you weren't a dude.

711
00:25:29,333 --> 00:25:32,417
I can tell with voices usually,
but some guys, they'll...

712
00:25:32,458 --> 00:25:36,792
they'll fool you
if that's what they want to do.

713
00:25:36,834 --> 00:25:38,834
Hey...

714
00:25:38,959 --> 00:25:41,625
Are you smiling at me?

715
00:25:41,667 --> 00:25:43,333
NARRATOR:<i> Lindsay decided</i>
<i>it was only fair</i>

716
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:45,333
<i>to let her husband know</i>

717
00:25:45,375 --> 00:25:47,542
<i>their new start</i>
<i>had reached a new end.</i>

718
00:25:47,583 --> 00:25:49,041
LINDSAY:
I left.

719
00:25:49,083 --> 00:25:50,250
I guess you noticed.

720
00:25:50,291 --> 00:25:52,041
Um, look, I'm sorry.

721
00:25:52,083 --> 00:25:55,667
I-I really do care about you,
Tobias, but we were trying

722
00:25:55,709 --> 00:25:58,542
to save something
that just couldn't be saved.

723
00:25:58,583 --> 00:26:01,667
And I have to follow
my shaman's advice. I...

724
00:26:01,709 --> 00:26:06,250
I have to be true
to myself for once.

725
00:26:06,291 --> 00:26:10,041
And Marky, he sees me
for who I really am.

726
00:26:10,083 --> 00:26:12,125
-He respects me and...
-Come on, lady!

727
00:26:12,166 --> 00:26:13,500
You want to wrap this up?

728
00:26:13,542 --> 00:26:16,208
My lady needs to call
her loser ex.

729
00:26:16,250 --> 00:26:18,417
Marky, it's me.

730
00:26:18,458 --> 00:26:19,792
It's Lindsay.

731
00:26:19,917 --> 00:26:21,208
Oh.

732
00:26:21,250 --> 00:26:22,500
I thought you
were taking a dump.

733
00:26:22,542 --> 00:26:23,542
Oh, I must have
scared the (bleep)

734
00:26:23,583 --> 00:26:25,250
off that lady in the bathroom

735
00:26:25,291 --> 00:26:28,417
when I threw the door open
and told her I loved her.

736
00:26:28,458 --> 00:26:31,000
(sighs, chuckles)

737
00:26:31,041 --> 00:26:32,625
He loves me?

738
00:26:32,667 --> 00:26:34,000
MARKY:
Sorry. False alarm.

739
00:26:34,041 --> 00:26:35,750
-I don't love you.
-LINDSAY: Uh, I got to go.

740
00:26:35,792 --> 00:26:37,250
Can you delete this
so I can leave

741
00:26:37,291 --> 00:26:38,625
-a message for Maeby?
-MARKY: It's good. She's fine.

742
00:26:38,667 --> 00:26:40,583
NARRATOR:
<i>And soon, the lovers arrived</i>

743
00:26:40,625 --> 00:26:43,542
<i>and discovered the joys</i>
<i>of their new desert home,</i>

744
00:26:43,583 --> 00:26:46,625
<i>dancing and making love</i>
<i>all night.</i>

745
00:26:46,667 --> 00:26:49,709
Now, that time...

746
00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:51,667
was also very quick.

747
00:26:51,709 --> 00:26:55,375
And now we've freed the night up
to dance again.

748
00:26:55,417 --> 00:26:56,542
-Come on.
-Oh. Okay.

749
00:26:56,583 --> 00:26:58,125
NARRATOR:
<i>And the next day,</i>

750
00:26:58,166 --> 00:27:00,041
<i>Lindsay awoke</i>
<i>to discover the destiny</i>

751
00:27:00,083 --> 00:27:04,041
<i>foretold to her in India</i>
<i>in drab colors before her.</i>

752
00:27:04,083 --> 00:27:05,792
WOMAN:
Get away from her.

753
00:27:05,834 --> 00:27:07,083
Don't mess with her!

754
00:27:07,125 --> 00:27:08,208
She's none of your business.

755
00:27:08,250 --> 00:27:10,041
(sighs) Thank you.

756
00:27:10,083 --> 00:27:12,041
I said get away from her,
you slut!

757
00:27:12,083 --> 00:27:13,083
You're scaring the bird.

758
00:27:13,125 --> 00:27:14,500
MARKY:
No, no, Mom.

759
00:27:14,542 --> 00:27:16,208
Mom, she's with us.

760
00:27:16,250 --> 00:27:18,000
She lives with us now.

761
00:27:18,041 --> 00:27:21,542
And, Mom,
she tells me she's pretty.

762
00:27:21,583 --> 00:27:24,583
I have the worst (bleep) shaman.

763
00:27:32,208 --> 00:27:36,208
The defense calls to the
oyster bar thing where they sit

764
00:27:36,250 --> 00:27:37,792
the adopted daughter,
Lindsay Bluth.

NARRATOR:
<i>Another chair is empty</i>

<i>-at Lucille's trial. </i>
-BARRY: Lindsay...

767
00:27:41,834 --> 00:27:43,792
Mr. Zuckerkorn,

Shrimp-Shooter Nights
starts in 15 minutes.

769
00:27:46,834 --> 00:27:48,291
Is your witness going to appear?

770
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:50,333
BARRY (gasps):
"Appear."

771
00:27:50,375 --> 00:27:53,250
Oh, I thought the one
on the pier was a Bubba Gump's.

772
00:27:55,083 --> 00:27:57,375
NARRATOR:<i> And, in an effort</i>
<i>to be less glamorous,</i>

<i>Lindsay cuts her hair</i>
<i>only to discover,</i>

774
00:28:00,417 --> 00:28:03,083
<i>-much to her frustration... </i>
-Great. Even cuter.

775
00:28:03,125 --> 00:28:05,291
<i>And Tobias becomes addicted</i>

776
00:28:05,333 --> 00:28:08,125
<i>-to his new profession. </i>
-I'm an addict,
and I'm starving.

777
00:28:08,166 --> 00:28:10,333
Yes, you are starving,
so would you like some butter?

778
00:28:10,375 --> 00:28:11,709
I could give you some butter,

779
00:28:11,750 --> 00:28:14,583
and, uh, you can pay for it
w-with a shoe.

780
00:28:14,625 --> 00:28:16,458
Um... I'm sorry, but, uh,

781
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:19,041
his guy's not giving my guy
anything, uh, to react to.

782
00:28:19,083 --> 00:28:22,083
Uh, could I get some more
of that, uh, acting juice?
