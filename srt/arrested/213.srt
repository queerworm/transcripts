male narrator: NOW THE STORY 
OF A WEALTHY FAMILY

00:00:04,545 --> 00:00:05,755
WHO LOST EVERYTHING,

3
00:00:05,755 --> 00:00:07,007
AND THE ONE SON 
WHO HAD NO CHOICE

4
00:00:07,007 --> 00:00:08,383
BUT TO KEEP THEM ALL TOGETHER.

5
00:00:13,721 --> 00:00:16,057
IT'S "ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT."

6
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:21,521
MICHAEL BLUTH 
HAD GOTTEN UP EARLY

7
00:00:21,521 --> 00:00:24,190
IN THE HOPES 
OF AVOIDING HIS FAMILY.

8
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:26,651
HIS MOTHER, HOWEVER, 
WAS ALREADY DRESSED,

9
00:00:26,651 --> 00:00:28,194
MADE UP, 
AND WAITING FOR HIM.

10
00:00:28,194 --> 00:00:29,945
- GOOD MORNING. 
- OOH!

11
00:00:29,945 --> 00:00:31,572
narrator: WHICH PUT 
HER WAKE-UP TIME

12
00:00:31,572 --> 00:00:34,200
IN THE 3:00, 3:30 AREA.

13
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:35,618
- I COULDN'T SLEEP.

14
00:00:35,618 --> 00:00:37,495
I ALWAYS GET THIS WAY 
BEFORE MOTHERBOY.

15
00:00:37,495 --> 00:00:39,914
- OH, GOD. 
IT'S MOTHERBOY ALREADY?

16
00:00:39,914 --> 00:00:42,083
narrator: MOTHERBOY WAS 
A DINNER DANCE AIMED

17
00:00:42,083 --> 00:00:44,252
AT PROMOTING MOTHER-SON BONDING.

18
00:00:44,252 --> 00:00:47,588
LUCILLE HAD GONE OVER 25 TIMES 
WITH BUSTER,

19
00:00:47,588 --> 00:00:51,384
AND ON A FEW OCCASIONS, 
HAD WON CUTEST COUPLE.

20
00:00:51,384 --> 00:00:54,595
AS ONE ENTERED SEXUAL MATURITY, 
AND THE OTHER ONE LEFT IT,

21
00:00:54,595 --> 00:00:55,930
IT BECAME HARDER TO WIN.

22
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:57,348
- I'M SO HOT.

23
00:00:57,348 --> 00:00:59,767
- IF YOU WERE HOT, 
MOTHER, WE WOULD WIN.

24
00:00:59,767 --> 00:01:01,144
- IT'S NOT JUST MOTHERBOY.

25
00:01:01,144 --> 00:01:03,438
IT'S MOTHERBOY XXX.

26
00:01:03,438 --> 00:01:05,398
AND I THINK WITH YOU, 
I'VE GOT A SHOT.

27
00:01:05,398 --> 00:01:07,067
- OH, NO.

28
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:09,277
BUSTER, FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER, 
DOESN'T WANT TO DO THIS?

29
00:01:09,277 --> 00:01:10,820
- NO, NO, HE DOES.

30
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:12,780
IT'S JUST, 
HE'S BEEN SO MOPEY.

31
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:14,324
- WELL, THAT COULD HAVE 
SOMETHING TO DO

32
00:01:14,324 --> 00:01:15,825
WITH THE FACT 
THAT A SEAL ATE HIS HAND.

33
00:01:15,825 --> 00:01:17,327
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS.

34
00:01:17,327 --> 00:01:18,661
- I THINK THAT'S WHAT IT IS.

35
00:01:18,661 --> 00:01:20,871
- WHO KNOWS? 
narrator: IT WAS THAT.

36
00:01:20,871 --> 00:01:22,582
IT HAD HAPPENED WEEKS EARLIER

37
00:01:22,582 --> 00:01:24,500
WHEN BUSTER 
WENT SWIMMING IN THE OCEAN

38
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:26,627
AGAINST HIS MOTHER'S WISHES.

39
00:01:26,627 --> 00:01:28,087
- [screaming]

40
00:01:28,087 --> 00:01:29,922
narrator: HE HAD BECOME HAUNTED 
BY THE LOSS...

41
00:01:29,922 --> 00:01:31,632
- [gasps]

42
00:01:31,632 --> 00:01:34,469
narrator: SEEING REMINDERS 
OF THE ACCIDENT EVERYWHERE.

43
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:36,512
- [gasps]

44
00:01:40,808 --> 00:01:43,478
[gasps and screams]

45
00:01:43,478 --> 00:01:45,771
MOTHER, I CAN'T SLEEP.

46
00:01:45,771 --> 00:01:47,565
I MAY NOT BE ABLE TO GO 
TO DANCE PRACTICE TODAY.

47
00:01:47,565 --> 00:01:50,110
- I'M GOING OUT. 
ZIP ME UP.

48
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:52,027
I MEAN, 
LOOK HOW HE ZIPS NOW.

49
00:01:52,027 --> 00:01:53,571
- I KNOW WHAT THIS IS.

50
00:01:53,571 --> 00:01:55,156
YOU'RE EMBARRASSED BY HIM, 
AREN'T YOU?

51
00:01:55,156 --> 00:01:57,158
YOU SPENT YOUR WHOLE LIFE 
OVER-MOTHERING THE GUY,

52
00:01:57,158 --> 00:01:59,119
AND WHEN HE FINALLY NEEDS YOU, 
YOU'RE NOT THERE.

53
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:01,537
- WELL, I DON'T SEE YOU 
SPENDING TIME WITH HIM.

54
00:02:01,537 --> 00:02:03,331
narrator: THE BLUTH CHILDREN 
HAD BEEN UNEASY

55
00:02:03,331 --> 00:02:05,375
ABOUT MISSING LIMBS

56
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:07,042
SINCE THEIR FATHER USED 
A ONE-ARMED MAN

57
00:02:07,042 --> 00:02:08,378
TO TEACH THEM LESSONS.

58
00:02:08,378 --> 00:02:12,590
- THAT'S WHY YOU DON'T YELL.

59
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:15,593
- AS A MATTER OF FACT, 
I'M GOING TO SEE BUSTER TODAY.

60
00:02:15,593 --> 00:02:17,011
SO YOU'RE GONNA HAVE 
TO FIND

61
00:02:17,011 --> 00:02:19,013
A DIFFERENT DANCE PARTNER 
FOR MOTHERBOY.

62
00:02:19,013 --> 00:02:22,308
- GOD. NOT THAT "I'M IN LOVE 
WITH MY MOTHER" DANCE THING.

63
00:02:22,308 --> 00:02:23,726
I'M SO GLAD THERE WASN'T 
ONE OF THOSE

64
00:02:23,726 --> 00:02:25,186
FOR DADDIES AND DAUGHTERS.

65
00:02:25,186 --> 00:02:27,021
- OF COURSE THEY HAVE 
FATHER-DAUGHTER DANCES.

66
00:02:27,021 --> 00:02:29,106
- THEY DO? 
HE NEVER TOOK ME?

67
00:02:29,106 --> 00:02:32,443
- IT WAS BEFORE 
WE DID YOUR NOSE. TOODLE-OOH.

68
00:02:32,443 --> 00:02:33,944
- YOU'RE UP AWFUL EARLY.

69
00:02:33,944 --> 00:02:35,946
- YEAH, WELL, MY MARRIAGE 
IS FALLING APART.

70
00:02:35,946 --> 00:02:38,574
TOBIAS IS BACK WITH CARL.

71
00:02:38,574 --> 00:02:40,326
narrator: 
TOBIAS HAD GOTTEN A CALL

72
00:02:40,326 --> 00:02:43,246
FROM HIS ONE-TIME ACTING 
TEACHER, CARL WEATHERS.

73
00:02:43,246 --> 00:02:45,165
- HE'S DIRECTING SOMETHING 
FOR TV,

74
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:48,459
BUT HE THINKS 
HE MIGHT HAVE A PART FOR ME.

75
00:02:48,459 --> 00:02:50,211
IF THIS TAKES OFF,

76
00:02:50,211 --> 00:02:53,005
I MIGHT BE ABLE TO BUY YOU 
THE HAPPINESS THAT YOU DESERVE.

77
00:02:53,005 --> 00:02:54,549
- HE SAID THE SAME THING 
WHEN HE GOT CAST

78
00:02:54,549 --> 00:02:56,133
AS FRIGHTENED INMATE NUMBER TWO

79
00:02:56,133 --> 00:02:57,802
IN THAT FILM 
HE GOT FIRED FROM.

80
00:02:57,802 --> 00:03:00,012
narrator: HE HAD EVEN 
GOTTEN A VANITY PLATE MADE UP

81
00:03:00,012 --> 00:03:01,806
ANNOUNCING THE ACHIEVEMENT.

82
00:03:01,806 --> 00:03:04,517
AND THIS WASN'T THE FIRST TIME.

83
00:03:08,854 --> 00:03:10,481
- HE'S SO CLUELESS.

84
00:03:10,481 --> 00:03:12,650
HE'S NOT YOUR REAL 
"TAKE CHARGE" HUSBAND.

85
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:15,528
- LINDSAY, YOU'RE STILL LOOKING 
FOR SOMEBODY LIKE DADDY, OKAY?

86
00:03:15,528 --> 00:03:18,448
LET'S NOT FORGET THAT HE 
WAS ALSO DISMISSIVE

87
00:03:18,448 --> 00:03:19,699
AND DISINTERESTED.

88
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:21,826
- NO. NO, HE HAD GOOD QUALITIES.

89
00:03:21,826 --> 00:03:24,329
narrator: ACTUALLY, GEORGE, SR. 
WAS SECRETLY LIVING

90
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:27,957
IN THE ATTIC ABOVE THEM 
AND WAS STARVED FOR COMPANY.

91
00:03:27,957 --> 00:03:29,959
- NOW,

92
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:32,503
WHO WANTS TO TAKE 
THEIR TOP OFF?

93
00:03:32,503 --> 00:03:35,381
narrator: WHEN GEORGE MICHAEL 
AND MAEBY CAME IN.

94
00:03:35,381 --> 00:03:37,258
- SO YOU AND ANN 
ARE ACTUALLY GOING

95
00:03:37,258 --> 00:03:39,469
ON A CHRISTIAN CAMPING TRIP?

96
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:40,845
- IT'S CALLED THE PROMISE LAND.

97
00:03:40,845 --> 00:03:43,097
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO MAKE PROMISES 
ABOUT YOUR RELATIONSHIP

98
00:03:43,097 --> 00:03:45,933
AS A TRIBUTE TO THE GENERATIONS 
THAT PRECEDED YOU.

99
00:03:45,933 --> 00:03:47,852
HEY, THERE'S BOOZE IN THIS.

100
00:03:47,852 --> 00:03:50,230
- THAT'S THE PROMISE LAND 
THAT ANN'S TAKING YOU TO?

101
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:52,898
YOU'RE GONNA NEED THIS 
MORE THAN POLLY HERE.

102
00:03:52,898 --> 00:03:55,235
- THAT FAT ONE'S POLLY?

103
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:57,278
- HEY, WHAT ARE YOU KIDS 
DOIN' UP HERE?

104
00:03:57,278 --> 00:03:59,029
- WE'RE JUST LOOKIN' 
FOR THE CAMPING STUFF.

105
00:03:59,029 --> 00:04:01,241
HEY, DO YOU KNOW WHERE THE 
PUMP IS FOR THE AIR MATTRESS?

106
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:04,285
- I HAD TO TAKE ALL PUMPS 
OUT OF HERE A LONG TIME AGO.

107
00:04:04,285 --> 00:04:06,246
TAKE THIS DOWN TO 
THE KITCHEN, WILL YOU?

108
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:08,122
I THINK IT'S GETTING A LITTLE 
TOO RISKY KEEPING YOU UP HERE.

109
00:04:08,122 --> 00:04:09,499
- YEAH, YOU KNOW WHAT'S RISKY?

110
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:11,542
LETTIN' YOUR SON 
GO ON THAT CHURCH THING.

111
00:04:11,542 --> 00:04:13,919
- WELL, HER NAME'S ANN, DAD, AND 
HE'S NOT "GOING" ON HER, OKAY?

112
00:04:13,919 --> 00:04:15,170
THEY'RE JUST FRIENDS.

113
00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:16,547
- NOT FOR LONG.

114
00:04:16,547 --> 00:04:18,549
THEY'RE MAKING PROMISES 
TO EACH OTHER.

115
00:04:18,549 --> 00:04:20,343
IT'S ALL THAT FIDELITY 
AND PLEDGING YOURSELF

116
00:04:20,343 --> 00:04:22,052
TO A WOMAN GARBAGE.

117
00:04:22,052 --> 00:04:23,638
I WINE 'EM AND DINE 'EM,

118
00:04:23,638 --> 00:04:25,180
BUT I DON'T LET 'EM 
TELL ME WHAT TO DO.

119
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:30,728
I DON'T LET 'EM 
TELL ME WHAT TO DO.

120
00:04:30,728 --> 00:04:32,813
- OKAY, I SHOULD'VE NEVER TAKEN 
THE PUMPS OUT OF HERE.

121
00:04:32,813 --> 00:04:36,692
LISTEN, UNLIKE YOU, 
I RESPECT MY SON'S CHOICES.

122
00:04:36,692 --> 00:04:38,653
GEORGE MICHAEL, I DON'T THINK 
YOU SHOULD BE GOING

123
00:04:38,653 --> 00:04:40,154
ON THIS PROMISE LAND THING.

124
00:04:40,154 --> 00:04:41,947
- WHAT? WHY? 
IS THIS BECAUSE I'D MISS SCHOOL?

125
00:04:41,947 --> 00:04:43,240
- NO.

126
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,825
- YOU GET 
TO MISS SCHOOL FOR THAT?

127
00:04:44,825 --> 00:04:46,452
narrator: 
AND THAT'S WHEN MAEBY DECIDED

128
00:04:46,452 --> 00:04:47,953
TO BECOME A DEVOUT CHRISTIAN.

129
00:04:47,953 --> 00:04:49,455
- DO YOU GUYS KNOW WHERE I 
COULD GET ONE

130
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:51,248
OF THOSE GOLD NECKLACES 
WITH THE "T" ON IT?

131
00:04:51,248 --> 00:04:54,335
- THAT'S A CROSS. 
- ACROSS FROM WHERE?

132
00:04:54,335 --> 00:04:57,463
- UM, IT'S NOT ABOUT SCHOOL, 
PAL. IT'S MORE ABOUT FAMILY.

133
00:04:57,463 --> 00:04:59,424
YOUR UNCLE BUSTER'S BEEN 
VERY DEPRESSED LATELY,

134
00:04:59,424 --> 00:05:00,758
AND YOU HAVEN'T VISITED HIM.

135
00:05:00,758 --> 00:05:02,427
FAMILY FIRST.

136
00:05:02,427 --> 00:05:05,179
OR DID THEY NOT TEACH YOU THAT 
AT THE PROMISE LAND?

137
00:05:05,179 --> 00:05:06,806
- I DON'T KNOW. 
YOU WON'T LET ME GO.

138
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:09,099
- [clicks tongue] ATTABOY.

139
00:05:10,601 --> 00:05:12,312
narrator: MICHAEL THEN WENT 
TO THE OFFICE,

140
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:14,146
WHERE HE RAN INTO GOB.

141
00:05:14,146 --> 00:05:17,024
- BARRY COME BY YET? I NEED TO 
TALK TO HIM ABOUT MY DIVORCE.

142
00:05:17,024 --> 00:05:19,485
narrator: GOB HAD ONCE 
GOTTEN MARRIED ON A DARE,

143
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:21,195
A FACT HE'D ONLY REMEMBERED

144
00:05:21,195 --> 00:05:23,823
WHEN HE WAS SERVED 
WITH DIVORCE PAPERS.

145
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:27,076
- THAT COW IS GOING AFTER ME. 
- YOUR WIFE? SHE WAS SUPER-THIN.

146
00:05:27,076 --> 00:05:28,536
- SHE WAS? 
- YEAH.

147
00:05:28,536 --> 00:05:30,330
- WHAT ABOUT HER CANS? 
SHE HAVE BIG CANS?

148
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:31,872
- YOU DON'T REMEMBER HER AT ALL, 
DO YOU?

149
00:05:31,872 --> 00:05:33,666
- HEY, IT WAS ONE NIGHT 
OF WILD PASSION.

150
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:35,167
- AND YET YOU DIDN'T 
NOTICE HER BODY.

151
00:05:35,167 --> 00:05:36,669
- I LIKE TO LOOK IN THE MIRROR.

152
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:38,629
- OKAY, THAT WOULD BE DISGUSTING

153
00:05:38,629 --> 00:05:40,881
IF YOU'D ACTUALLY SLEPT WITH 
HER, BUT I DON'T THINK YOU DID.

154
00:05:40,881 --> 00:05:43,801
- I DID, AND IT WAS DISGUSTING.

155
00:05:43,801 --> 00:05:45,928
narrator: THEY DIDN'T, 
BUT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN.

156
00:05:45,928 --> 00:05:47,346
- ANYWAY, REMEMBER THAT SEAL 
OF HERS

157
00:05:47,346 --> 00:05:48,598
THAT I RELEASED INTO THE OCEAN?

158
00:05:48,598 --> 00:05:49,599
BIT OFF BUSTER'S HAND?

159
00:05:49,599 --> 00:05:51,392
- VAGUELY.

160
00:05:51,392 --> 00:05:53,268
- HER LAWYERS ARE CLAIMING 
THAT THE SEAL'S WORTH 250 GRAND.

161
00:05:53,268 --> 00:05:55,270
AND THAT'S NOT EVEN 
INCLUDING BUSTER'S SWATCH.

162
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:57,314
- LISTEN, GOB, IF YOU ADMIT 
IN COURT

163
00:05:57,314 --> 00:05:59,066
THAT YOU NEVER 
CONSUMMATED THE MARRIAGE,

164
00:05:59,066 --> 00:06:01,527
YOU CAN GET IT ANNULLED 
AND WALK AWAY FREE AND CLEAR.

165
00:06:01,527 --> 00:06:03,278
YOU JUST CAN'T DEAL 
WITH THE FACT

166
00:06:03,278 --> 00:06:05,239
THAT I'VE GOT A SUPER-THIN 
WIFE WITH HUGE CANS.

167
00:06:05,239 --> 00:06:06,991
[elevator bell dings]

168
00:06:06,991 --> 00:06:09,118
- ALL RIGHT. WHO'S READY TO SHOW 
THEIR LAWYER SOME LOVE?

169
00:06:09,118 --> 00:06:10,578
- THE SEAL?

170
00:06:10,578 --> 00:06:12,204
- HA! MUST'VE HAD 
A TRACKING DEVICE ON IT.

171
00:06:12,204 --> 00:06:14,289
SOMEONE TRACKED IT ALL THE WAY 
TO A DOCK IN DANA POINT.

172
00:06:14,289 --> 00:06:16,584
- YOU KNOW, IF THAT HAND IS 
STILL INTACT INSIDE THE SEAL,

173
00:06:16,584 --> 00:06:18,586
BUSTER'S GOT A SHOT 
AT A TRANSPLANT.

174
00:06:18,586 --> 00:06:20,838
- AT THE VERY LEAST, WE CAN GET 
BUSTER'S SWATCH BACK, RIGHT?

175
00:06:20,838 --> 00:06:22,673
UP TOP. NO?

176
00:06:22,673 --> 00:06:26,301
narrator: AND TOBIAS MET WITH 
CARL WEATHERS AT BURGER KING.

177
00:06:26,301 --> 00:06:28,220
- THANKS FOR MEETING ME DOWN 
HERE AT BURGER KING.

178
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:29,972
I'M TRYIN' TO GET THEM

179
00:06:29,972 --> 00:06:31,766
TO UNDERWRITE A NEW 
TV PROJECT I'M WORKIN' ON.

180
00:06:31,766 --> 00:06:33,559
GET SOME MONEY IN EXCHANGE 
FOR SETTIN' A SCENE

181
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:35,060
HERE IN BURGER KING.

182
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:36,979
- AS LONG AS YOU 
DON'T DRAW ATTENTION TO IT.

183
00:06:36,979 --> 00:06:40,315
- I'M DIRECTING AN EPISODE 
OF THE SERIES "SCANDAL MAKERS."

184
00:06:40,315 --> 00:06:41,942
IT'S ABOUT THE BLUTH FAMILY

185
00:06:41,942 --> 00:06:43,819
AND YOUR FATHER-IN-LAW'S 
ESCAPE FROM JUSTICE.

186
00:06:43,819 --> 00:06:45,780
I PLAY THE LEAD-- 
A BOUNTY HUNTER, NAME OF ICE.

187
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:47,239
- OH, NO.

188
00:06:47,239 --> 00:06:48,783
YOU WANT ME TO PLAY MYSELF, 
DON'T YOU?

189
00:06:48,783 --> 00:06:51,160
I SWORE I'D NOT GO REALITY.

190
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:54,955
- NO, I ALREADY GOT A GREAT GUY 
NAMED DAVE ATTELL TO PLAY YOU.

191
00:06:54,955 --> 00:06:57,082
I WASN'T ACTUALLY HERE 
TO ASK YOU TO BE IN IT.

192
00:06:57,082 --> 00:07:00,419
I'M LOOKIN' FOR SOMEBODY IN YOUR 
FAMILY TO SIGN A RELEASE.

193
00:07:00,419 --> 00:07:03,380
- I COULD NOT BETRAY MY FAMILY 
LIKE THAT.

194
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:04,924
- COME ON, MAN. 
I'VE GOT EVERY PART CAST

195
00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:06,509
EXCEPT FOR GEORGE, SR.

196
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:08,385
- I WANT THAT PART.

197
00:07:08,385 --> 00:07:10,846
- THEN SIGN OVER THE RIGHTS.

198
00:07:10,846 --> 00:07:12,222
I'M GONNA GO GET A NEW SODA.

199
00:07:12,222 --> 00:07:14,141
DID YOU KNOW THAT YOU CAN GET 
A REFILL

200
00:07:14,141 --> 00:07:16,894
ON ANY DRINK YOU WANT HERE, 
AND IT'S FREE?

201
00:07:16,894 --> 00:07:18,062
[laughs]

202
00:07:18,062 --> 00:07:20,355
- IT'S A WONDERFUL RESTAURANT.

203
00:07:20,355 --> 00:07:22,274
narrator: IT SURE IS.

204
00:07:22,274 --> 00:07:24,276
GEORGE MICHAEL, 
MEANWHILE, SPENT AN AFTERNOON

205
00:07:24,276 --> 00:07:27,279
WITH HIS UNCLE, 
AT HIS FATHER'S SUGGESTION.

206
00:07:27,279 --> 00:07:29,114
- OH, GOD! 
- I KEEP FORGETTING ABOUT THIS.

207
00:07:29,114 --> 00:07:31,576
- OH, ME TOO. 
- WELL, THAT'S A DO-OVER.

208
00:07:31,576 --> 00:07:33,578
SO WHO SHOULD GO FIRST?

209
00:07:33,578 --> 00:07:35,871
I KNOW. LET'S 
ROCK-PAPER-SCISSORS FOR IT.

210
00:07:35,871 --> 00:07:37,873
- NO! YOU WOULD'VE-- 
YOU WOULD'VE WON THAT, SO--

211
00:07:37,873 --> 00:07:39,291
- OH.

212
00:07:39,291 --> 00:07:41,085
- GEORGE MICHAEL-- 
BUSTER,

213
00:07:41,085 --> 00:07:43,337
DID YOU AT LEAST OFFER 
YOUR NEPHEW A BOWL OF SOUP?

214
00:07:43,337 --> 00:07:45,422
- YES, MOTHER, I DID.

215
00:07:45,422 --> 00:07:47,007
CAN I OPEN 
A CAN OF SOUP FOR YOU?

216
00:07:47,007 --> 00:07:48,634
- CAN IT OPEN A CAN?

217
00:07:48,634 --> 00:07:49,802
- CAN WHAT OPEN A CAN?

218
00:07:49,802 --> 00:07:51,303
- OH, GOD. 
- OH, GOD.

219
00:07:51,303 --> 00:07:52,972
ACTUALLY, I JUST WANTED 
TO SPEND SOME TIME

220
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:54,474
WITH MY KNUCKLE BUSTER.

221
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:56,809
- SEE, MOTHER? NOT EVERYBODY 
IS AFRAID OF ME.

222
00:07:56,809 --> 00:07:58,603
- OH, MY GOD.

223
00:07:58,603 --> 00:08:00,521
- AREN'T YOU THE SWEETEST THING,

224
00:08:00,521 --> 00:08:03,440
SPENDING SOME TIME WITH 
WHAT'S LEFT OF YOUR UNCLE.

225
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,860
- I WAS SUPPOSED TO GO AWAY TO 
THE PROMISE LAND THIS WEEKEND,

226
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:07,653
BUT MY DAD DIDN'T WANT ME TO.

227
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:09,154
- FAMILY FIRST.

228
00:08:09,154 --> 00:08:10,990
- WELL, YOU'VE DONE 
YOUR DUTY THIS WEEK.

229
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:13,701
YOU'RE A VERY SYMPATHETIC 
YOUNG MAN.

230
00:08:14,785 --> 00:08:16,537
VERY SYMPATHETIC.

231
00:08:16,537 --> 00:08:18,038
YOU KNOW WHAT?

232
00:08:18,038 --> 00:08:19,749
YOU DESERVE TO GO OUT OF TOWN 
THIS WEEKEND,

233
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:21,333
AND I'M TAKING YOU.

234
00:08:21,333 --> 00:08:22,752
- REALLY?

235
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:24,629
Narrator: GEORGE MICHAEL 
SHOULD HAVE REALIZED

236
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:27,047
BY THE SAILOR SUIT 
LUCILLE DRESSED HIM IN

237
00:08:27,047 --> 00:08:30,009
THAT HE WASN'T GOING NORTH 
TO THE PROMISE LAND.

238
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:31,927
- [singing] 
ANYONE ELSE BUT ME

239
00:08:31,927 --> 00:08:34,429
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU DON'T KNOW 
THIS SONG, GEORGE MICHAEL.

240
00:08:34,429 --> 00:08:35,681
[singing] NO, NO, NO

241
00:08:35,681 --> 00:08:37,600
narrator: 
NO, HE WAS GOING SOUTH.

242
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:40,477
SOUTH TO MOTHERBOY.

243
00:08:45,357 --> 00:08:47,151
narrator: AND MICHAEL AND GOB 
HEADED OUT

244
00:08:47,151 --> 00:08:48,944
TO FIND THE SEAL 
WITH THE TRACKING DEVICE.

245
00:08:48,944 --> 00:08:50,362
- I GUESS WE SHOULD CALL BUSTER

246
00:08:50,362 --> 00:08:52,990
AND HAVE HIM MEET US 
AT THE DOCK, RIGHT?

247
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:55,450
- I GUESS SO.

248
00:08:55,450 --> 00:08:57,202
[all screaming]

249
00:08:57,202 --> 00:08:59,413
- OR WE COULD MAKE SURE 
IT'S THE RIGHT SEAL FIRST?

250
00:08:59,413 --> 00:09:00,915
I MEAN, WHY GET HIS HOPES UP?

251
00:09:00,915 --> 00:09:02,332
- YEAH, THAT'S BETTER.

252
00:09:02,332 --> 00:09:04,084
- KNOCK, KNOCK. 
- OH, GOD!

253
00:09:04,084 --> 00:09:06,170
- MONSTER! 
- HEY, BROTHERS.

254
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:08,005
- BUSTER. 
- MONSTER!

255
00:09:08,005 --> 00:09:10,049
- SORRY ABOUT THE WINDOW. 
- NOT A PROBLEM.

256
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:12,176
- I REALLY HATE 
THIS STUPID HOOK.

257
00:09:12,176 --> 00:09:15,220
BUT I CERTAINLY CAN'T WALK 
AROUND LIKE THIS.

258
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:17,973
- WHY NOT? 
- VERY HANDSOME.

259
00:09:17,973 --> 00:09:19,975
SO LISTEN, 
WE WERE JUST GONNA CALL YOU.

260
00:09:19,975 --> 00:09:21,852
WE THINK WE KNOW 
WHERE THE SEAL IS.

261
00:09:21,852 --> 00:09:23,020
- THE SEAL THAT 
DID THIS TO ME?

262
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:24,438
- YEAH.

263
00:09:24,438 --> 00:09:26,273
- TAKE ME! 
- YES. THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.

264
00:09:26,273 --> 00:09:28,400
I'M GONNA GO WITH BARRY. 
NO, NO, YOU SHOULD GET IN HERE.

265
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,069
I'LL JUST GO WITH BARRY.

266
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:32,071
THERE'S NOT ENOUGH ROOM 
FOR YOU AND ME AND THE STUMP

267
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:34,114
AND THE THING--STUFF. 
BARRY!

268
00:09:34,114 --> 00:09:36,617
narrator: TOBIAS HAD GOTTEN 
HIS FIRST SPEAKING ROLE

269
00:09:36,617 --> 00:09:38,911
SIMPLY BY SIGNING AWAY 
THE LIFE RIGHTS

270
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:40,830
OF EVERYONE HE LOVED.

271
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:43,082
AND NOW HE NEEDED SOME RESEARCH.

272
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:44,834
- I'M GEORGE, SR.

273
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:46,251
OOH, THAT'S GOOD. 
THAT'S THE VOICE.

274
00:09:46,251 --> 00:09:48,087
I'VE GOT THE VOICE.

275
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:50,547
- THAT'S NOT MY VOICE. 
- OH, MY GOD!

276
00:09:50,547 --> 00:09:52,091
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

277
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:53,508
- I'M HAVIN' 
A [bleep] TEA PARTY.

278
00:09:53,508 --> 00:09:55,094
WHAT DOES IT LOOK LIKE? 
I LIVE HERE.

279
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:57,805
YOU TELL ANYBODY, YOU ARE DEAD.

280
00:09:57,805 --> 00:10:00,725
narrator: TOBIAS SAW 
THE RAW POWER OF GEORGE, SR.

281
00:10:00,725 --> 00:10:05,104
- STOP LICKING MY HAND, 
YOU HORSE'S ASS.

282
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:07,189
narrator: A POWER HE NEEDED 
THE MAN TO TEACH HIM.

283
00:10:07,189 --> 00:10:08,691
- THAT'S IT.

284
00:10:08,691 --> 00:10:10,567
narrator: SO HE EXPLAINED 
THE PROJECT,

285
00:10:10,567 --> 00:10:12,820
AND GEORGE, SR. 
AGREED ON ONE CONDITION.

286
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:15,322
- IF YOU PLAY ME, 
YOU GOT TO PLAY ME LIKE A MAN

287
00:10:15,322 --> 00:10:18,826
AND NOT SOME MINCING LITTLE 
POLLY OR NELLIE.

288
00:10:18,826 --> 00:10:24,539
I GET THOSE NAMES CONFUSED. 
APOLOGIES. APOLOGIES ALL AROUND.

289
00:10:24,539 --> 00:10:27,167
narrator: AND THE SEARCH 
FOR BUSTER'S HAND CONTINUED.

290
00:10:27,167 --> 00:10:28,377
- I WOULD LOVE TO BE ABLE 
TO SAY

291
00:10:28,377 --> 00:10:29,962
"LOOK WHAT I'VE 
HAD REATTACHED

292
00:10:29,962 --> 00:10:32,297
WHILE YOU AND GEORGE MICHAEL 
WERE OFF TO MOTHERBOY."

293
00:10:32,297 --> 00:10:34,091
- MOTHERBOY? WAIT A MINUTE.

294
00:10:34,091 --> 00:10:35,801
MOM TOOK HIM TO MOTHERBOY?

295
00:10:35,801 --> 00:10:37,678
- [laughs]

296
00:10:37,678 --> 00:10:39,930
HE COULDN'T WAIT TO SWOOP IN 
AND THROW ON THAT SAILOR SUIT,

297
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:41,807
BECAUSE HE'S NOT DAMAGED GOODS.

298
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:43,558
- WAIT A MINUTE. 
I DON'T WANT HIM DOING THAT.

299
00:10:43,558 --> 00:10:45,895
YOU GOT TO GO WITH ME DOWN THERE 
AND HELP ME GET HIM, ALL RIGHT?

300
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:47,271
THAT PLACE IS YOUR SCENE.

301
00:10:47,271 --> 00:10:49,106
- FACE IT, MICHAEL. 
THEY'VE WON.

302
00:10:49,106 --> 00:10:51,275
HE'S THE NEW BUSTER.

303
00:10:51,275 --> 00:10:52,652
narrator: 
THIS WAS THE WORST THING

304
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:54,611
MICHAEL COULD POSSIBLY HEAR.

305
00:10:54,611 --> 00:10:57,072
- OH, I'M SO SORRY. 
FALSE ALARM.

306
00:10:57,072 --> 00:10:58,991
WHAT THEY TRACKED DOWN 
WAS A SHARK,

307
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:00,785
AND HE MUST'VE BITTEN OFF 
THE PART OF THE SEAL

308
00:11:00,785 --> 00:11:02,202
WITH THE TRACKING DEVICE ON IT.

309
00:11:02,202 --> 00:11:03,495
LEFT FLIPPER.

310
00:11:03,495 --> 00:11:06,165
- SO THE SEAL LOST 
HIS HAND TOO.

311
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:08,333
- YEAH, POOR GUY'S PROBABLY OUT 
THERE WITHOUT A FLIPPER,

312
00:11:08,333 --> 00:11:12,504
SWIMMING AROUND IN A CIRCLE, 
FREAKING OUT HIS WHOLE FAMILY.

313
00:11:12,504 --> 00:11:15,257
- THAT TRACKING DEVICE TELLS ME 
HE WAS RAISED IN CAPTIVITY.

314
00:11:15,257 --> 00:11:17,802
THERE'S NO WAY HE STOOD 
A CHANCE OUT IN THE REAL WORLD.

315
00:11:17,802 --> 00:11:19,553
- SEE THAT, BUSTER? 
HE WAS A VICTIM TOO.

316
00:11:19,553 --> 00:11:21,138
YOU BOTH WERE TOO SHELTERED

317
00:11:21,138 --> 00:11:22,807
TO LEARN HOW 
TO PROTECT YOURSELVES,

318
00:11:22,807 --> 00:11:24,809
AND WE CAN'T LET THAT HAPPEN 
TO GEORGE MICHAEL.

319
00:11:24,809 --> 00:11:28,979
- I WILL HELP YOU, MICHAEL. 
WE'VE GOT TO RESCUE YOUR SON.

320
00:11:28,979 --> 00:11:30,940
- AND I'VE GOT TO 
STAPLE THIS TO A SEAL.

321
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:34,151
- AND I'VE SKIPPED BREAKFAST, 
SO I'M OFF TO BURGER KING.

322
00:11:36,695 --> 00:11:39,031
narrator: AND LUCILLE ARRIVED 
AT THE HOTEL

323
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:41,116
WHERE MOTHERBOY 
WAS TAKING PLACE.

324
00:11:41,116 --> 00:11:45,204
- THIS IS NICE, SPENDING SOME 
TIME, JUST THE TWO OF US.

325
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:48,332
OH, [bleeps] ME. 
THE EXACT SAME COLOR.

326
00:11:48,332 --> 00:11:49,792
WHAT ARE THE ODDS?

327
00:11:49,792 --> 00:11:52,252
NOT TO WORRY. 
GANGY BROUGHT SOME BACKUPS.

328
00:11:52,252 --> 00:11:54,421
WE'LL GET A ROOM 
SO WE CAN CHANGE.

329
00:11:54,421 --> 00:11:57,424
YOU THINK ENOUGH TIME HAS PASSED 
TO DO SONNY AND CHER?

330
00:11:57,424 --> 00:11:59,134
- WHO? 
- WE'RE HERE FOR MOTHERBOY.

331
00:11:59,134 --> 00:12:02,054
- AND YOU DO REALIZE 
THIS IS NOT THE BAND.

332
00:12:02,054 --> 00:12:04,556
narrator: MOTHERBOY WAS ALSO 
A HEAVY METAL BAND

333
00:12:04,556 --> 00:12:07,351
THAT USED TO ROCK 
PRETTY HARD IN THE '70s.

334
00:12:07,351 --> 00:12:10,312
WE ARE LEGALLY OBLIGATED 
TO MAKE THE DISTINCTION.

335
00:12:10,312 --> 00:12:12,606
- YOU KNOW, MAYBE I SHOULD LET 
MY DAD KNOW THAT WE'RE HERE.

336
00:12:12,606 --> 00:12:15,776
- OH, HE'LL KNOW WHEN WE 
BRING HOME THE TROPHY.

337
00:12:15,776 --> 00:12:17,820
- YEAH, BUT MAYBE 
I'LL JUST GIVE HIM A CALL.

338
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:20,990
- AND WHAT NAME SHALL WE 
PUT THE ROOM UNDER?

339
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:22,532
- KARMOPOLIS.

340
00:12:22,532 --> 00:12:24,451
narrator: AND LINDSAY 
WAS ABOUT TO SEE

341
00:12:24,451 --> 00:12:27,662
A TOBIAS WITH 
THE RAW POWER OF GEORGE, SR.

342
00:12:27,662 --> 00:12:29,664
- I SORT OF WANT TO TALK 
TO YOU ABOUT SOME THINGS.

343
00:12:29,664 --> 00:12:31,250
- IT'S A LITTLE LATE 
FOR TALK, LINDSAY.

344
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:33,752
I'M A MAN OF ACTION NOW.

345
00:12:38,423 --> 00:12:41,010
YOU DON'T NEED THE CALORIES.

346
00:12:42,552 --> 00:12:45,139
[whispering] 
THIS ISN'T WORKING.

347
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:46,598
- IS IT MY IMAGINATION,

348
00:12:46,598 --> 00:12:49,894
OR IS HE MORE COMMANDING 
AND MANNISH?

349
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:52,813
IT'S LIKE, I DON'T KNOW, 
MAYBE I DO WANT TO BE WITH HIM.

350
00:12:52,813 --> 00:12:55,649
- THEN YOU SHOULD GO TO HIM. 
FOR AS IT IS WRITTEN,

351
00:12:55,649 --> 00:12:57,317
YOU SHALL BE WITH WHOM 
YOU HAVE FORMED

352
00:12:57,317 --> 00:13:00,570
A MORE PERFECT UNION 
WITH UNDER GOD.

353
00:13:00,570 --> 00:13:03,323
- [chuffs] 
SHE'S RIGHT.

354
00:13:03,323 --> 00:13:05,534
- THIS ISN'T WORKING.

355
00:13:05,534 --> 00:13:07,452
- I'M SORRY. YOU'VE GOT 
THE WRONG MOTHERBOY.

356
00:13:07,452 --> 00:13:09,329
- YEAH, THIS LOOKS 
LIKE THE PLACE.

357
00:13:09,329 --> 00:13:11,206
- AND MICHAEL AND BUSTER 
ARRIVED AT MOTHERBOY.

358
00:13:11,206 --> 00:13:14,584
- EXCUSE ME. HAS A LUCILLE BLUTH 
CHECKED IN?

359
00:13:14,584 --> 00:13:16,045
- I HAVE NO ONE 
BY THAT NAME.

360
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:17,462
- GOD.

361
00:13:17,462 --> 00:13:18,839
SHE KNOWS YOU'RE AFTER HER.

362
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:20,215
- SHE DOES?

363
00:13:20,215 --> 00:13:22,592
- WAIT A MINUTE. 
I RECOGNIZE THOSE OUTFITS.

364
00:13:22,592 --> 00:13:24,094
WE'RE GETTING YOU OUT OF HERE.

365
00:13:24,094 --> 00:13:25,595
- THANK YOU! THANK YOU!

366
00:13:25,595 --> 00:13:27,056
- OH, GOD! IT'S RED. 
- TAKE ME WITH YOU!

367
00:13:27,056 --> 00:13:28,098
NO, PLEASE! PLEASE!

368
00:13:28,098 --> 00:13:29,099
- IT'S THE WRONG CHILD.

369
00:13:29,099 --> 00:13:30,600
- WHERE DO WE GO NEXT?

370
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,186
- I WILL TELL YOU THIS, MICHAEL.

371
00:13:32,186 --> 00:13:34,354
IF MOTHER SAW THOSE TWO, 
SHE IS GOING TO CHANGE CLOTHES.

372
00:13:34,354 --> 00:13:36,273
AND THAT MEANS 
HE'LL BE ON THE BALCONY.

373
00:13:36,273 --> 00:13:37,900
WHENEVER SHE CHANGED CLOTHES,

374
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:40,319
SHE MADE ME WAIT ON 
THE BALCONY UNTIL ZIP-UP.

375
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:41,778
AND YET, 
ANYTHING GOES AT BATH TIME.

376
00:13:41,778 --> 00:13:43,405
[chuckles]

377
00:13:43,405 --> 00:13:45,365
- LET'S CHECK THE BALCONIES.

378
00:13:45,365 --> 00:13:47,993
narrator: AND BARRY PREPARED GOB 
TO MEET WITH HIS WIFE.

379
00:13:47,993 --> 00:13:50,079
- IF YOU REALLY WANT 
TO SETTLE THIS, NOW, YOUR JOB

380
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:52,372
IS TO CONVINCE 
THAT "WIFE" OF YOURS

381
00:13:52,372 --> 00:13:54,249
THAT YOU ARE WILLING TO GO 
IN FRONT OF THE JUDGE

382
00:13:54,249 --> 00:13:56,043
AND ADMIT 
THAT YOU NEVER HAD SEX.

383
00:13:56,043 --> 00:13:57,794
- SHE HAS A NAME, BARRY.

384
00:13:57,794 --> 00:13:59,838
YOU DON'T HAPPEN TO KNOW 
WHAT IT IS BY THE WAY, DO YOU?

385
00:13:59,838 --> 00:14:03,258
- THAT'S WHY I WANT TO SETTLE. 
I'M NOT SUPER PREPARED.

386
00:14:03,258 --> 00:14:07,054
- WELL, WE DID HAVE SEX. 
AND I'M NOT A GREAT LIAR.

387
00:14:07,054 --> 00:14:09,223
narrator: BOTH THINGS HE JUST 
SAID WERE LIES.

388
00:14:09,223 --> 00:14:10,682
- BUT IF YOU THINK 
IT'LL SCARE HER OFF.

389
00:14:10,682 --> 00:14:12,184
- I DO, AND IT WILL.

390
00:14:12,184 --> 00:14:13,978
AND YOU DON'T WANT TO GO 
IN FRONT OF THAT JUDGE.

391
00:14:13,978 --> 00:14:15,687
I CAUGHT HIM IN A DRAG CLUB.

392
00:14:15,687 --> 00:14:17,481
- WHAT WERE YOU DOIN' THERE?

393
00:14:17,481 --> 00:14:19,942
- WOW. YOU SHOULD BE THE LAWYER.

394
00:14:24,154 --> 00:14:27,157
narrator: AND SOON, MICHAEL 
AND BUSTER SURVEYED THE HOTEL,

395
00:14:27,157 --> 00:14:28,825
LOOKING FOR GEORGE MICHAEL.

396
00:14:28,825 --> 00:14:30,702
- THERE'S A VERY BORED-LOOKING 
LITTLE SONNY BONO

397
00:14:30,702 --> 00:14:32,412
ON THAT BALCONY.

398
00:14:32,412 --> 00:14:34,999
- OH, GOD. THAT MEANS 
SHE'LL BE DRESSED LIKE CHER.

399
00:14:34,999 --> 00:14:38,502
- I HAVE AN IDEA.

400
00:14:38,502 --> 00:14:40,629
IT IS TIME I USED SOMETHING 
I TRAINED FOR IN ARMY

401
00:14:40,629 --> 00:14:42,589
BUT I NEVER GOT A CHANCE TO DO.

402
00:14:42,589 --> 00:14:44,716
- BUSTER, YOU CANNOT ZIP-LINE 
OVER THERE!

403
00:14:44,716 --> 00:14:46,510
- EITHER I ZIP DOWN 
OR HE ZIPS UP!

404
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:49,596
AND THAT IS A MIGHTY LONG ZIPPER 
ON MOTHER'S CHER JUMPSUIT.

405
00:14:49,596 --> 00:14:51,556
YOU HAVE TO GET ON 
YOUR KNEES TO START IT.

406
00:14:51,556 --> 00:14:54,684
- THIS IS MUCH LESS SCARY. 
GODSPEED, BUSTER.

407
00:14:56,186 --> 00:14:57,687
- [screaming]

408
00:14:57,687 --> 00:14:59,523
[glass shattering]

409
00:14:59,523 --> 00:15:02,859
- ONE, TWO, THREE-- 
- [screaming]

410
00:15:02,859 --> 00:15:05,862
- YOU CAME FOR ME!

411
00:15:05,862 --> 00:15:07,697
- [screaming] 
- ZIP ME UP.

412
00:15:10,325 --> 00:15:13,703
[glass shattering]

413
00:15:13,703 --> 00:15:15,789
- WE'RE SWITCHING ROOMS AGAIN.

414
00:15:15,789 --> 00:15:18,250
AND COSTUMES.

415
00:15:21,836 --> 00:15:24,548
narrator: TOBIAS HAD BEGUN WORK 
ON THE SET OF "SCANDAL MAKERS."

416
00:15:24,548 --> 00:15:26,341
- WHAT'S SO GREAT ABOUT TOBIAS

417
00:15:26,341 --> 00:15:28,802
IS HE'S GOT THIS OBLIGATION 
TO HIS WIFE AND DAUGHTER.

418
00:15:28,802 --> 00:15:30,971
- WHOA. THIS GUY'S STRAIGHT? 
- YEAH.

419
00:15:30,971 --> 00:15:34,266
- THEN WHAT THE HELL AM I 
WEARIN' THESE FOR? LOOK AT THAT.

420
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:35,642
- HEY, GANG. I'M SORRY.

421
00:15:35,642 --> 00:15:37,311
I DON'T WANT 
TO NOTE YOU TO DEATH,

422
00:15:37,311 --> 00:15:39,813
BUT YOU SHOULD BE WEARING THOSE 
UNDER YOUR PANTS.

423
00:15:39,813 --> 00:15:42,607
- WHY? 
- OH, IT'S A THING.

424
00:15:42,607 --> 00:15:44,109
THERE'S DOZENS OF US.

425
00:15:44,109 --> 00:15:45,610
- CARL, THIS WHOLE THING 
IS STARTIN' TO FEEL

426
00:15:45,610 --> 00:15:46,861
LIKE A REAL CAREER KILLER.

427
00:15:46,861 --> 00:15:48,488
- YEAH, I KNOW, MAN. 
- ALSO, I--

428
00:15:48,488 --> 00:15:50,365
- TOBIAS, WHY DON'T YOU 
GO LEARN YOUR LINES, MAN?

429
00:15:50,365 --> 00:15:51,575
WORK ON THEM.

430
00:15:51,575 --> 00:15:53,243
- DID I GET LINES? GOD!

431
00:15:53,243 --> 00:15:55,454
THEY TOLD ME I WAS JUST JUMPING 
ONTO A MOVING STAIR CAR.

432
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:58,873
- IF THAT MAN'S STRAIGHT, 
THEN I AM SOBER.

433
00:15:58,873 --> 00:16:01,668
- HI. UM, I'M WAITING 
FOR "GAWB" BLUTH.

434
00:16:01,668 --> 00:16:03,920
- I'M GOB BLUTH. 
MY WIFE SEND YOU?

435
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:06,090
- I'M YOUR WIFE. 
- I KNEW THAT.

436
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:09,801
NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN, USARMY.

437
00:16:09,801 --> 00:16:11,053
YOU LOST A LOT OF WEIGHT 
IN IRAQ,

438
00:16:11,053 --> 00:16:13,597
ESPECIALLY UP IN 
THE NORTHERN REGION.

439
00:16:13,597 --> 00:16:16,391
- SO WHERE'S THE SEAL? 
- HEY, THAT'S NOT MY PROBLEM.

440
00:16:16,391 --> 00:16:19,436
AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED, 
WE WERE NEVER EVEN MARRIED.

441
00:16:19,436 --> 00:16:22,481
MAYBE I'LL JUST SAY THAT 
WE NEVER SEALED THE DEAL.

442
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:25,359
- YOU'RE WILLING TO ADMIT THAT? 
- LIE ABOUT IT? YES.

443
00:16:25,359 --> 00:16:28,612
- WOW. 
I MIS-UNDERESTIMATED YOU.

444
00:16:28,612 --> 00:16:30,405
YOU'VE GOT SOME COURAGE.

445
00:16:30,405 --> 00:16:32,574
MAKES ME WONDER 
WHAT I'M MISSING.

446
00:16:32,574 --> 00:16:34,368
- YOU MEAN, 
OTHER THAN YOUR CANS?

447
00:16:34,368 --> 00:16:37,287
- NO. THEY'RE STILL HERE.

448
00:16:37,287 --> 00:16:39,748
narrator: AND SO GOB 
SET ABOUT CONSUMMATING

449
00:16:39,748 --> 00:16:43,127
THE MARRIAGE HE'D FINALLY AGREED 
TO CLAIM HE HADN'T.

450
00:16:43,127 --> 00:16:45,670
- [laughing]

451
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:47,464
narrator: 
AND BACK AT MOTHERBOY XXX,

452
00:16:47,464 --> 00:16:50,384
LUCILLE WAS FINDING 
HER NEW PARTNER AN ASSET.

453
00:16:50,384 --> 00:16:53,553
- IS THIS YOUR SON? 
- NO, I'M HIS GRANDMOTHER.

454
00:16:53,553 --> 00:16:54,596
HE'S AN ORPHAN.

455
00:16:54,596 --> 00:16:55,889
- OH, I'M SO SORRY.

456
00:16:55,889 --> 00:16:57,432
WELL, YOU GUYS SHOULD WIN.

457
00:16:57,432 --> 00:16:59,518
- WELL, I'M NOT AN ORPHAN. 
I HAVE A DAD.

458
00:16:59,518 --> 00:17:02,437
- WELL, GOOD LUCK TO YOU.

459
00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:06,733
- WELL, THAT LITTLE BIT 
OF HONESTY HELPED NOTHING.

460
00:17:06,733 --> 00:17:09,986
YOU'D BETTER BRING IT 
TO THE WALTZ, YOUNG MAN.

461
00:17:09,986 --> 00:17:11,655
narrator: MEANWHILE, 
MICHAEL AND BUSTER

462
00:17:11,655 --> 00:17:13,198
HAD RETRIEVED BUSTER'S HOOK

463
00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:16,743
AND WERE STAKING OUT 
THE SITUATION.

464
00:17:16,743 --> 00:17:18,995
- GYPSIES.

465
00:17:18,995 --> 00:17:21,456
- HEY.

466
00:17:21,456 --> 00:17:22,749
- [groans]

467
00:17:22,749 --> 00:17:24,293
- THEY'VE CHANGED INTO GYPSIES.

468
00:17:24,293 --> 00:17:26,002
MY ARMY TRAINING

469
00:17:26,002 --> 00:17:30,549
TELLS ME THAT THIS IS 
GOING TO BE A HOT MISSION.

470
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:32,717
- ONE HOT MISSION. 
- YES.

471
00:17:32,717 --> 00:17:34,053
I CREATE A DIVERSION,

472
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:36,055
AND YOU GRAB 
GEORGE MICHAEL AND GO.

473
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:39,391
WE NEED A NAME.

474
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:43,062
MAYBE 
"OPERATION HOT MOTHER."

475
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:46,106
- NO, LET'S TRY TO TOP THAT.

476
00:17:46,106 --> 00:17:47,524
narrator: THEY NEVER DID.

477
00:17:47,524 --> 00:17:50,902
AND LATER, OPERATION 
HOT MOTHER WAS UNDERWAY.

478
00:17:50,902 --> 00:17:52,779
BUSTER WAS WAITING 
FOR MICHAEL'S CUE

479
00:17:52,779 --> 00:17:54,989
TO UNPLUG THE LIGHTS.

480
00:17:54,989 --> 00:17:58,618
BUT THAT'S WHEN BUSTER 
CAUGHT HIS HOOK ON A SANDBAG.

481
00:17:58,618 --> 00:18:01,496
- HEY! 
- [grunts]

482
00:18:01,496 --> 00:18:03,165
[whimpering]

483
00:18:03,165 --> 00:18:04,874
- AND NOW FROM THE LAND 
OF GYPSIES,

484
00:18:04,874 --> 00:18:07,669
LUCILLE BLUTH 
AND HER ORPHANED GRANDSON.

485
00:18:07,669 --> 00:18:09,629
- WHAT THE HELL'S GOIN' ON, 
BUSTER? CUT THE LIGHTS!

486
00:18:09,629 --> 00:18:14,050
- [Buster whimpering] 
[people gasping]

487
00:18:14,050 --> 00:18:15,677
- BUSTER? 
- GRAB HIM!

488
00:18:15,677 --> 00:18:17,471
TAKE THE GYPSY BOY!

489
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:19,264
- COME ON, I'M TAKING 
YOU OUT OF HERE. LET'S GO.

490
00:18:19,264 --> 00:18:20,849
- WHAT? 
THEY HAVEN'T SERVED DINNER YET.

491
00:18:20,849 --> 00:18:22,642
- GEORGE MICHAEL. 
- YOU'RE NOT TAKING HIM.

492
00:18:22,642 --> 00:18:25,104
- TAKE ME WITH YOU! 
- WHAT ARE YOU DOIN'? I CAN'T.

493
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:27,481
GET OFF OF ME. 
BUSTER, LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.

494
00:18:27,481 --> 00:18:30,109
- I'M STUCK. GO. 
TAKE THE BOY. GO.

495
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:33,778
- ALL RIGHT, MOTHERBOYS. 
OUR CURTAIN SEEMS TO BE STUCK.

496
00:18:33,778 --> 00:18:37,866
WE'RE GOING TO DO SOME FREESTYLE 
WALTZING WHILE WE GET IT FIXED.

497
00:18:37,866 --> 00:18:40,535
BOYS' CHOICE.

498
00:18:40,535 --> 00:18:42,078
- GEORGE MICHAEL, 
YOU'RE CHOOSING ME.

499
00:18:42,078 --> 00:18:43,705
- NO, MOM.

500
00:18:43,705 --> 00:18:45,540
YOU HAD NO RIGHT TO BRING HIM 
TO THIS FREAK SHOW.

501
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:47,126
HE WAS SUPPOSED 
TO BE VISITING BUSTER.

502
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:48,960
- NO, YOU WERE SUPPOSED 
TO BE VISITING BUSTER,

503
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:51,045
BUT YOU MADE YOUR SON DO IT 
BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T WANT TO.

504
00:18:51,045 --> 00:18:53,298
- YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO DO IT? 
- YOU DIDN'T WANT TO?

505
00:18:53,298 --> 00:18:55,217
NO. BUSTER, I--

506
00:18:55,217 --> 00:18:57,469
I DIDN'T KNOW HOW 
TO, UH, TREAT YOU, ALL RIGHT?

507
00:18:57,469 --> 00:18:59,763
I THOUGHT THAT YOU 
WOULD BE A LITTLE DIFFERENT,

508
00:18:59,763 --> 00:19:01,055
BUT YOU'RE NOT.

509
00:19:01,055 --> 00:19:03,433
I WAS WRONG, OKAY? 
I'M SORRY.

510
00:19:03,433 --> 00:19:07,061
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE AS GOOD 
A BROTHER AS YOU EVER WERE.

511
00:19:07,061 --> 00:19:08,897
- [groaning]

512
00:19:08,897 --> 00:19:09,898
THANK YOU.

513
00:19:09,898 --> 00:19:11,608
- ALL RIGHT?

514
00:19:11,608 --> 00:19:14,319
- YES. I AM NO DIFFERENT. 
I AM THE SAME OLD MOTHERBOY.

515
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:17,697
GEORGE MICHAEL STILL 
HAS A CHANCE. TAKE HIM!

516
00:19:19,283 --> 00:19:21,160
- THANKS.

517
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,994
LET'S GO.

518
00:19:22,994 --> 00:19:25,079
- BOYS' CHOICE?

519
00:19:25,079 --> 00:19:30,169
THAT IS, IF YOU'RE NOT 
EMBARRASSED TO TAKE MY HOOK.

520
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:32,296
- OF COURSE NOT.

521
00:19:34,756 --> 00:19:38,134
I'M PETER PAN, 
AND YOU'RE CAPTAIN HOOK.

522
00:19:38,134 --> 00:19:40,136
WE'LL PRETEND IT'S A COSTUME.

523
00:19:40,136 --> 00:19:42,222
LET'S DANCE.

524
00:19:47,143 --> 00:19:48,562
narrator: AND THAT NIGHT,

525
00:19:48,562 --> 00:19:50,355
MICHAEL, 
HIS BROTHER, AND HIS SON

526
00:19:50,355 --> 00:19:51,565
ARRIVED AT THE PROMISE LAND.

527
00:19:51,565 --> 00:19:53,149
- ALL RIGHT.

528
00:19:53,149 --> 00:19:55,235
- I APPRECIATE YOU TAKING ME 
UP HERE TO SEE ANN.

529
00:19:55,235 --> 00:19:56,653
- A PROMISE IS A PROMISE.

530
00:19:56,653 --> 00:19:58,029
AND I'M GLAD THE THREE OF US

531
00:19:58,029 --> 00:19:59,573
WERE ABLE TO SPEND 
SOME TIME TOGETHER.

532
00:19:59,573 --> 00:20:01,157
- OH, YEAH.

533
00:20:01,157 --> 00:20:03,159
- AND I FINALLY FEEL GOOD 
ABOUT MYSELF.

534
00:20:03,159 --> 00:20:04,578
"SADDEST."

535
00:20:04,578 --> 00:20:06,162
- AND I SAW SOME 
OF THOSE PEOPLE.

536
00:20:06,162 --> 00:20:07,747
THAT WAS A VERY 
COMPETITIVE CATEGORY.

537
00:20:07,747 --> 00:20:09,291
- OH, DON'T I KNOW IT.

538
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:11,460
- HERE WE GO. 
- I CAN'T GET OUT, ACTUALLY.

539
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:14,045
narrator: ON THE NEXT 
"ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT,"

540
00:20:14,045 --> 00:20:18,383
LINDSAY FINDS HERSELF STRANGELY 
COMPELLED TO BE WITH TOBIAS.

541
00:20:18,383 --> 00:20:21,220
- I HAVE NEVER BEEN 
MORE ATTRACTED TO YOU.

542
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:22,971
- WOW. THE SERVICE 
SENT YOU OVER FAST.

543
00:20:22,971 --> 00:20:25,974
- OH, GOD. I'M SO SORRY. 
I'M IN THE WRONG TRAILER.

544
00:20:25,974 --> 00:20:27,809
narrator: BUT NOT THE ONE 
SHE'S MARRIED TO.

545
00:20:27,809 --> 00:20:31,062
- SO YOU DON'T CRY 
WHEN YOU TAKE THOSE OFF?

546
00:20:31,062 --> 00:20:32,689
narrator: 
HAVING FINALLY HAD SEX,

547
00:20:32,689 --> 00:20:36,192
GOB CAN ADMIT HE NEVER 
CONSUMMATED THEIR MARRIAGE.

548
00:20:36,192 --> 00:20:38,403
- JUDGE, MAYBE YOU SHOULD TAKE 
A LOOK AT THIS.

549
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:41,823
IT WAS TAKEN 
IN YOUR OFFICE JUST MOMENTS AGO.

550
00:20:41,823 --> 00:20:43,450
- BUT GOB CATCHES A LUCKY BREAK.

551
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:45,535
- THERE'S NO WAY TO TELL 
WHO THIS MAN IS.

552
00:20:45,535 --> 00:20:47,161
narrator: 
BUT IT DOESN'T LAST LONG.

553
00:20:47,161 --> 00:20:49,623
- THAT'S ME, YOUR HONOR. 
I [bleep] MY WIFE.

554
00:20:49,623 --> 00:20:53,126
- WELL, 
WE REALLY LOST THIS CASE.

555
00:20:53,126 --> 00:20:55,712
narrator: AND MAEBY IMPRESSES 
THE KIDS AT THE PROMISED LAND

556
00:20:55,712 --> 00:20:58,798
WITH HER ONE 
SCARY CAMPFIRE STORY.

557
00:20:58,798 --> 00:21:00,300
- KNOCK, SCRAPE.

558
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:02,218
THE ONLY THING 
MORE TERRIFYING

559
00:21:02,218 --> 00:21:05,764
THAN THE ESCAPED LUNATIC'S HOOK 
WAS HIS TWISTED CALL!

560
00:21:05,764 --> 00:21:10,101
- HEY, CAMPERS. 
[kids Screaming]

561
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:15,940
- I'M A MONSTER!

562
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:17,984
- THIS MAY HAVE BEEN 
A STEP BACKWARDS.

563
00:21:21,112 --> 00:21:25,742
[waltzing music]

564
00:21:25,742 --> 00:21:30,622
- [singing] UPON HER KNEE

565
00:21:30,622 --> 00:21:36,169
SO FINE TO BE

566
00:21:36,169 --> 00:21:41,383
MOTHER AND BOY

567
00:21:41,383 --> 00:21:46,555
MOTHER

568
00:21:46,555 --> 00:21:49,933
BOY
