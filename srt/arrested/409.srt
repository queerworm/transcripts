NARRATOR:<i> The Austerity Clinic</i>

00:00:14,682 --> 00:00:16,600
<i>that, on this particular day,</i>

3
00:00:16,642 --> 00:00:18,644
<i>was about to get</i>
<i>a new therapist.</i>

4
00:00:18,686 --> 00:00:23,022
Hello, everyone,
I am Dr. Tobias Funke

5
00:00:23,064 --> 00:00:25,233
and I will be your therapist.

6
00:00:25,275 --> 00:00:26,193
(officers clear throats)

7
00:00:26,234 --> 00:00:27,695
Yes, I'm getting to that.

8
00:00:27,736 --> 00:00:30,698
And I am also
a registered sex offender.

9
00:00:30,739 --> 00:00:32,199
Now, let's have a wrap-about.

10
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:33,158
(sighs)

11
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,243
I am here because...

12
00:00:35,285 --> 00:00:39,122
Lucille Austero has given me
the opportunity

13
00:00:39,164 --> 00:00:40,916
to pay my debt to society.

14
00:00:40,958 --> 00:00:42,710
-I'm doing this pro bono...
-NARRATOR:<i> Although technically</i>

15
00:00:42,751 --> 00:00:45,587
<i>it was society that owed him,</i>
<i>as he was the victim</i>

16

<i>of a merry mix-up.</i>

17
00:00:47,046 --> 00:00:49,508
Is there a little girl here
all by herself?

18
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:51,050
Daddy needs to get his rocks...

NARRATOR:<i> We don't have</i>
<i>to hear this again,</i>

20
00:00:52,887 --> 00:00:55,556

21
00:00:55,597 --> 00:00:57,349
Oh, hey, Officers,
are you here for the raccoon?

22
00:00:57,391 --> 00:00:59,059
Oh, no, I'm not a raccoon,
I'm...

23
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:00,268
NARRATOR AND BEARD:
<i>Because, instead</i>

24

25

BEARD:
<i>...this creep chose to ask</i>

26
00:01:03,856 --> 00:01:05,024

27
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:06,483

SAG or AFTRA?

NARRATOR:
<i>And for the first time,</i>

29
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:09,236

<i>for his television work.</i>

31
00:01:12,322 --> 00:01:15,367
Oh, no, no, that's not
representative of who I am.

32
00:01:15,409 --> 00:01:17,369
-Anus tart.
-Yep, that's me.

38

<i>but didn't want</i>
<i>to look too eager.</i>

39
00:01:33,635 --> 00:01:35,012
Yes.

40
00:01:35,054 --> 00:01:38,807
I'm also an analyst
and a therapist,

41
00:01:38,849 --> 00:01:40,434
which makes me...

42
00:01:40,475 --> 00:01:43,478
<i>Prison had taught Tobias</i>

Now, let's have a wrap-about,

45
00:01:47,858 --> 00:01:50,277
and what we'll do is just
take a comfy pose.

46
00:01:50,318 --> 00:01:53,196
I want everybody just to sit
back and relax where they are

47
00:01:53,238 --> 00:01:55,282
and let's learn
about each other

48
00:01:55,323 --> 00:01:58,159

Oh, my goodness.

50
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:03,457
Wow, well, uh, it seems as if
we are amongst royalty here.

52
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:05,793
I-I'm sorry, how old are you?

53
00:02:05,834 --> 00:02:07,544
-23. -Ah, well within my rights.

54
00:02:07,586 --> 00:02:10,798
Yes, why don't you, uh, take
the comfortable chair?

55
00:02:10,839 --> 00:02:13,216
And, um, and we're going
to start with you,

57
00:02:15,844 --> 00:02:17,930
Hi, I'm Mark.

58
00:02:17,972 --> 00:02:21,850
Mark Cherry-- we all know that--
but, please, first names only.

Oh, and Simon says you're out.

61
00:02:30,275 --> 00:02:32,694
No, no, Mark Cherry,
I was, I was having fun.

62
00:02:32,736 --> 00:02:34,613
I, I have a bit of a wit.

63
00:02:34,655 --> 00:02:36,740
Sometimes I have to tell people
'cause they can't figure it out

that I...

But, please, Mr. Cherry,
first names only.

66
00:02:41,996 --> 00:02:44,289
So I got involved with drugs,

67
00:02:44,331 --> 00:02:47,250
and there were bees
and drinking and...

68
00:02:47,292 --> 00:02:49,795

Arrested Development.

188

189
00:07:27,864 --> 00:07:31,243
Please, DeBrie,
you've got to do this.

NARRATOR:<i> Now he just had</i>
<i>to talk her into it.</i>

191
00:07:33,203 --> 00:07:36,581
I mean, this could be good for
you and it could be a huge hit

192
00:07:36,623 --> 00:07:39,667
and it's really the only way
they're gonna keep us together.

193
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:41,044
They won't let me be
your therapist,

194
00:07:41,086 --> 00:07:42,796
but they'll let me be
your director.

195
00:07:42,837 --> 00:07:46,507
I want the world to be able
to see this angel face.

196

-Oh.
-Oh, oh, dear.

197
00:07:48,509 --> 00:07:50,845
Well, that's a good luck sign
on Broadway.

198
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:52,764
On the East Coast it's "break
a leg," on the West Coast it's

Beard, I'm only here
to pick up my car keys.

204
00:08:02,816 --> 00:08:04,443
GOB:
Tobias?

205
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:05,444
Gob?

206
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:08,405
(Gob grunts)

207
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:09,697
Good to see you, old friend.

208
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:10,991
What have you been up to?

209
00:08:11,032 --> 00:08:13,368
Oh, uh, things are good,
nothing much.

210
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:14,619
I'm a registered sex offender,

211
00:08:14,661 --> 00:08:16,204
-but things are good.
-Yes, yes.

212
00:08:16,246 --> 00:08:18,248
And I'm working
at Lucille 2's rehab center--

213
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:21,876
the one she owns, not the one
she famously went to 12 times.

214
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:23,670
Can we finish this up
over breakfast? I'm starving.

215
00:08:23,711 --> 00:08:25,755
Oh, is it finishing?
Okay.

216
00:08:25,797 --> 00:08:27,466
<i>And the two friends caught up.</i>

217
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:29,343
But if I wouldn't have gotten
arrested, I wouldn't have

218
00:08:29,384 --> 00:08:30,802
ended up working at the rehab

219
00:08:30,844 --> 00:08:32,679
and I wouldn't have reconnected
with my love.

220
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,722
True, I can't ethically ravage
her body.

221
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:36,766
I have to leave that
to time, but

222
00:08:36,808 --> 00:08:38,893
she's just so much fun
to be with.

223
00:08:38,935 --> 00:08:40,395
I too am in a relationship,

224
00:08:40,437 --> 00:08:42,230
but this person is
sort of a celebrity.

225
00:08:42,272 --> 00:08:46,026
Well, turns out my femme fatale
is a bit of a celebrity herself.

226
00:08:46,067 --> 00:08:49,321
Well, looks like life is going
pretty well for both of us,

227
00:08:49,363 --> 00:08:50,655
except that I'm broke.

228
00:08:50,697 --> 00:08:52,199
And I'm a sex offender.

229
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,574
Michael expects me to sell

230
00:08:53,616 --> 00:08:54,951
these split-level death traps.

231
00:08:54,993 --> 00:08:56,995
And how am I
supposed to do that?

232
00:08:57,037 --> 00:08:59,373
I mean, there are no schools
or libraries or Internet

233
00:08:59,414 --> 00:09:01,291
or playgrounds
within 20 miles of here.

234
00:09:03,126 --> 00:09:06,254
You know, it's funny, I've been
looking for a place to live,

235
00:09:06,296 --> 00:09:08,756
and that fills virtually
every parole requirement I have.

236
00:09:08,798 --> 00:09:09,799
That's great.

237
00:09:09,841 --> 00:09:11,051
When can you move in?

238
00:09:11,092 --> 00:09:13,636
Uh, duh. Now.

239
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:15,514
<i>And with his living</i>
<i>arrangements taken care of,</i>

240
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:17,765
<i>Tobias returned to his</i>
<i>court-appointed work-release.</i>

241
00:09:17,807 --> 00:09:19,309
One, two, three, four, five...

242
00:09:19,351 --> 00:09:22,103
<i>And so began</i>
<i>an intense workshop to create</i>

243
00:09:22,145 --> 00:09:25,899
<i>the</i> Fantastic Four<i> musical,</i>
<i>written and directed by Tobias.</i>

244
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:28,193
Now, the script is in process,
but the goal is

245
00:09:28,235 --> 00:09:30,904
that we all get a little outing
on the Cinco de Cuatro,

246
00:09:30,945 --> 00:09:33,240
where we'll be performing it
on a boat.

247
00:09:33,281 --> 00:09:34,991
I hope no one gets seasick.

248
00:09:35,033 --> 00:09:38,870
Okay. And Mark Cherry is going
to be doing the music for us.

249
00:09:38,912 --> 00:09:40,497
And this will make
my stay shorter, right?

250
00:09:40,539 --> 00:09:42,082
I'll get out of here
a week sooner?

251
00:09:42,123 --> 00:09:44,251
Well, sobriety is
the most important thing,

252
00:09:44,292 --> 00:09:46,627
but we'll see
how good the music is.

253
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:47,921
<i>Tobias inspired the troops.</i>

254
00:09:47,962 --> 00:09:49,256
All right, let's get up!

255
00:09:49,297 --> 00:09:51,341
<i>And after some</i>
<i>initial trepidation,</i>

256
00:09:51,383 --> 00:09:53,718
<i>Argyle set to work</i>

257
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,011
-Back, step.

Out, back, step, back, step.

Out-- now, try that.

-Yeah, yeah.
-Baby steps, Argyle.

266

She's brittle.

267
00:10:10,068 --> 00:10:12,112
Tobias, it does not
get babier than this.

268
00:10:12,153 --> 00:10:13,988
-Maybe I can't do this.
-You can do it.

269
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:15,907
Tobias, I can do it.

00:12:46,433 --> 00:12:48,518
How much of the remainder
could you generate?

342
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:52,146
Well, if my sister could call in
some debts, probably all of it.

343
00:12:52,188 --> 00:12:53,690
-Oh.
-But that means

344
00:12:53,732 --> 00:12:56,526
we'd have to use
the Cinco show as a preview,

345
00:12:56,568 --> 00:12:58,819
and she would want to know
that we have the rights.

346
00:12:58,861 --> 00:13:00,196
Of course, of course.

347
00:13:00,238 --> 00:13:02,240
Wait a minute.
We don't have the rights?

348
00:13:02,282 --> 00:13:03,866
-Well, not yet.
-(others murmuring)

349
00:13:03,908 --> 00:13:05,660
Not yet, but I was
going to ask you about that.

350
00:13:05,702 --> 00:13:07,078
Who produced the one
you were in?

351
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,706
Uh, I think
it's Imagine Generic.

352
00:13:09,748 --> 00:13:11,249
Ron Howard's company.

353
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:13,918
<i>Imagine Generic</i>
<i>was a division set up</i>

354
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:16,546
<i>to extend the rights to films</i>
<i>that studios weren't</i>

355
00:13:16,588 --> 00:13:18,131
<i>prepared to make yet.</i>

356
00:13:18,172 --> 00:13:20,675
I just hope the three of us
make it back.

357
00:13:20,717 --> 00:13:22,385
Three of us?

358
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:27,307
Houston, we're having a baby.

359
00:13:29,183 --> 00:13:31,144
DeBRIE:<i> I don't want</i>
<i>to get arrested again</i>

360
00:13:31,185 --> 00:13:32,562
because we don't
have the rights.

361
00:13:32,604 --> 00:13:33,605
-(others murmuring)
-Okay, no, all right.

362
00:13:33,647 --> 00:13:35,231
No, no! All right. Settle down.

363
00:13:35,273 --> 00:13:36,857
Settle down.
This has happened to

364
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:39,569
every Broadway show in
the history of Broadway shows.

365
00:13:39,611 --> 00:13:44,365
And I swear I shall
acquire the rights.

366
00:13:44,407 --> 00:13:46,409
NARRATOR:
<i>So Tobias went to do so,</i>

367
00:13:46,451 --> 00:13:48,536
<i>as Argyle set a dinner date</i>
<i>with his sister</i>

368
00:13:48,578 --> 00:13:50,622
<i>at the Balboa Club...</i>

369
00:13:50,664 --> 00:13:52,666
-Imagine Entertainment.
-Oh!

370
00:13:52,707 --> 00:13:54,668
<i>...on the same night</i>
<i>that Michael's date, Rebel,</i>

371
00:13:54,709 --> 00:13:56,628
<i>was finding her father's</i>
<i>character under attack.</i>

372
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:58,713
...uh, Ron is not
like that at all.

373
00:13:58,755 --> 00:14:00,965
<i>Of course, Michael thought</i>
<i>Ron was Rebel's boyfriend.</i>

374
00:14:01,007 --> 00:14:02,676
In fact,
he's almost too generous.

375
00:14:02,717 --> 00:14:04,051
Sounds like the Ron Howard

376
00:14:04,093 --> 00:14:05,386
Man of the Year Awards, though,
you know?

377
00:14:05,428 --> 00:14:06,387
<i>And the evening broke up</i>

378
00:14:06,429 --> 00:14:07,846
<i>of its own accord.</i>

379
00:14:07,888 --> 00:14:09,724
-My son is sick, so...
-Oh, no.

380
00:14:09,766 --> 00:14:11,058
I have to go.

381
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:12,435
Rebel.

382
00:14:12,477 --> 00:14:14,437
Rebel, let me come.
I'm great with kids.

383
00:14:14,479 --> 00:14:15,938
It's not about the kid.

384
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:17,482
I'm not comfortable here.

385
00:14:17,524 --> 00:14:19,400
Okay. Are you off to see him?

386
00:14:19,442 --> 00:14:20,860
Listen, if you've got a problem
with me seeing other people,

387
00:14:20,901 --> 00:14:22,278
why don't you just
come out and say it?

388
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,530
No, no, no, I can.

389
00:14:23,571 --> 00:14:25,031
What do you mean?
I can handle that.

390
00:14:25,072 --> 00:14:26,533
We'll see each other a la carte,
you know?

391
00:14:26,574 --> 00:14:27,784
Like the $18 baked potato

392
00:14:27,826 --> 00:14:29,661
you ordered
that you didn't touch.

393
00:14:29,703 --> 00:14:31,663
Yeah, you're not comfortable.

394
00:14:31,705 --> 00:14:32,955
Yeah, no, well, listen.

395
00:14:32,997 --> 00:14:33,956
Rebel, Rebel.

396
00:14:33,998 --> 00:14:34,999
Fine. See you later.

397
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:36,835
Say hi to Ron Howard for me.

398
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:38,712
<i>And perhaps because neither</i>
<i>Michael nor Lindsay</i>

399
00:14:38,753 --> 00:14:41,548
<i>could handle rejection,</i>
<i>they blamed each other.</i>

400
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:43,007
Well, hope you're happy.
My girlfriend left,

401
00:14:43,049 --> 00:14:44,384
'cause she can't stand
your right-wing

402
00:14:44,425 --> 00:14:45,926
American scallop-eating
boyfriend.

403
00:14:45,968 --> 00:14:48,805
Well, he left because
your chirpy little actress

404
00:14:48,847 --> 00:14:50,640
-couldn't keep her mouth shut.
-That's it.

405
00:14:50,682 --> 00:14:52,225
Know what?
You're out of the movie.

406
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:53,768
Fine.

407
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:56,354
-Good night.
-Good night.

408
00:14:56,396 --> 00:14:59,315
<i>And with his evening freed up,</i>
<i>Michael reached out to a son</i>

409
00:14:59,357 --> 00:15:00,983
<i>-he'd earlier blown off.</i> 
-Good night.

410
00:15:01,025 --> 00:15:02,026
George Michael, hey.

411
00:15:02,068 --> 00:15:03,319
Got out of it.

412
00:15:03,361 --> 00:15:05,613
I just-- I made
a ton of people angry,

413
00:15:05,655 --> 00:15:07,615
but you know what I always say:
family...

414
00:15:07,657 --> 00:15:09,826
GEORGE MICHAEL: Well, ah, gosh,
you know, I really wanted to,

415
00:15:09,868 --> 00:15:13,079
uh, do that, but I just had
this work thing come up.

416
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,873
And, uh, it's like
you always say:

417
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:17,500
family first,
unless there's a work thing,

418
00:15:17,542 --> 00:15:18,959
and then work first.

419
00:15:19,001 --> 00:15:20,545
I have said that, too.

420
00:15:20,587 --> 00:15:23,923
Well, I've got politics
and producing stuff I can...

421
00:15:23,964 --> 00:15:26,259
<i>After being kicked out</i>
<i>of his son's dorm</i>

422
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:28,052
<i>and stood up</i>
<i>at the Ealing Club,</i>

423
00:15:28,094 --> 00:15:30,304
<i>this particular rejection</i>
<i>really hurt.</i>

424
00:15:30,346 --> 00:15:31,681
Another time.

425
00:15:31,723 --> 00:15:33,516
<i>But he tried to put on</i>
<i>a brave face</i>

426
00:15:33,558 --> 00:15:35,727
<i>when he ran into a woman</i>
<i>he was in debt to.</i>

427
00:15:35,769 --> 00:15:37,812
-Who is this?
-Oh, this is

428
00:15:37,854 --> 00:15:38,979
my baby brother, Argyle.

429
00:15:39,021 --> 00:15:40,648
And here's the family joke:

430
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:43,484
I'm a tall drink of water,
and he's the chaser.

431
00:15:43,526 --> 00:15:44,485
(both laugh)

432
00:15:44,527 --> 00:15:46,821
Should be flipped, right?

433
00:15:46,863 --> 00:15:49,699
No, because here's another joke:
you owe my sister

434
00:15:49,741 --> 00:15:53,703
$700,000, and I'm going to
chase you down until you pay up.

435
00:15:53,745 --> 00:15:55,747
And if you don't pay up
by the fourth,

436
00:15:55,789 --> 00:15:57,206
you're gonna be washing up

437
00:15:57,248 --> 00:15:59,709
with the rest of
the broken piñatas on the fifth.

438
00:15:59,751 --> 00:16:01,127
WOMAN:
Lucille!

439
00:16:01,168 --> 00:16:02,128
Oh, hello.

440
00:16:02,169 --> 00:16:03,463
Who's-- ow, ow!

441
00:16:03,504 --> 00:16:04,964
God, what is on the bottom
of those shoes?

442
00:16:05,005 --> 00:16:06,340
Taps.

443
00:16:06,382 --> 00:16:09,009
And I can tap dance
all over your face,

444
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:10,428
if you know what I mean.

445
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:11,721
Even if my heart won't

446
00:16:11,763 --> 00:16:13,431
-snap back into place.
-(snaps fingers)

447
00:16:13,473 --> 00:16:15,349
I don't know what you meant
with the last part there.

448
00:16:15,391 --> 00:16:17,852
I'll chase you down
and find you, Michael.

449
00:16:17,894 --> 00:16:19,979
You can't hide
in a gorilla suit from me.

450
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:23,274

You okay?

475
00:17:15,743 --> 00:17:17,495
Michael.
(chuckles)

476
00:17:17,537 --> 00:17:19,622
What a pleasant surprise.

477
00:17:19,664 --> 00:17:21,875
Please, make yourself at home.

478
00:17:21,916 --> 00:17:23,376
I am. I'm home.

479
00:17:23,417 --> 00:17:26,253
This is my-- I own
all the homes here, actually.

480
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:28,506
And Gob's supposed to be
selling these, so...

481
00:17:28,548 --> 00:17:29,757
Where is he? Do you know?

482
00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:30,842
Oh, out and about.

483
00:17:30,884 --> 00:17:33,344
Me doth think he hath a lady.

484
00:17:33,386 --> 00:17:35,388
-As doth I dooth.
-Oh.

485
00:17:35,429 --> 00:17:37,765
And they're both
bit of, uh, celebrities.

486
00:17:37,807 --> 00:17:40,727
Well, that is odd, because
I-I'm also dating a celebrity.

487
00:17:40,768 --> 00:17:42,687
Oh, perchance a double date
is in our future,

488
00:17:42,729 --> 00:17:44,647
-eh, brother-in-law?
-I don't...

489
00:17:44,689 --> 00:17:45,732
Tell me about her.

490
00:17:45,773 --> 00:17:46,816
(inhales sharply)

491
00:17:46,858 --> 00:17:48,234
I-- you know, I-I don't think

492
00:17:48,275 --> 00:17:49,819
that-that you're the best one
to talk to

493
00:17:49,861 --> 00:17:52,112
about my relationship
difficulties.

494
00:17:52,154 --> 00:17:53,740
Fair enough.

495
00:17:53,781 --> 00:17:57,159
It's only what I do
for a living, Michael.

496
00:17:58,745 --> 00:18:01,622
(voice breaking):
What I'm trained to do.

497
00:18:01,664 --> 00:18:04,500
-Well, let-let me tell you
a little bit about her. -Okay.

498
00:18:04,542 --> 00:18:06,002
So it's a simple choice, really.

499
00:18:06,044 --> 00:18:07,294
If I keep seeing her,

500
00:18:07,336 --> 00:18:08,880
he'll find out
and kill the movie.

501
00:18:08,922 --> 00:18:11,215
So I either keep the girl
and lose the movie,

502
00:18:11,257 --> 00:18:13,467
or I keep the movie,
lose the girl.

503
00:18:13,509 --> 00:18:16,512
But the whole reason that I did
the movie was to get the girl.

504
00:18:16,554 --> 00:18:17,555
It's...

505
00:18:17,597 --> 00:18:18,765
(sighs)

506
00:18:18,806 --> 00:18:21,726
Michael, I appreciate
your bravery.

507
00:18:21,768 --> 00:18:23,603
And I know
everything seems doomed now--

508
00:18:23,644 --> 00:18:25,897
and believe me, I'm in
a similar situation myself--

509
00:18:25,939 --> 00:18:29,067
but trust me...

510
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:30,026
(sighs)

511
00:18:30,068 --> 00:18:31,235
...we are (bleep).

512
00:18:31,277 --> 00:18:32,403
You're (bleep).

513
00:18:32,445 --> 00:18:34,030
(bleep).

514
00:18:34,072 --> 00:18:36,198
I mean, unless some sort of
miracle coincidence happens.

515
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:40,494
But, no, the best thing to do
is just walk away,

516
00:18:40,536 --> 00:18:43,664
and we'll lick
each other's wounds.

517
00:18:43,706 --> 00:18:45,917
I guess I'm just going
to have to give up my dream

518
00:18:45,959 --> 00:18:48,252
and my love forever.

519
00:18:48,294 --> 00:18:51,089
I think I should just go tell
Ron Howard that it is over.

520
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:52,882
Yes. R-Ron Howard?

521
00:18:52,924 --> 00:18:54,383
-Ron Howard's making this movie?
-Yeah.

522
00:18:54,425 --> 00:18:56,302
Michael, you can't just
walk away from this.

523
00:18:56,343 --> 00:18:57,762
You have to go talk to him.

524
00:18:57,804 --> 00:18:59,179
You just told me
the exact opposite.

525
00:18:59,221 --> 00:19:00,723
Reverse psychology.
It didn't work.

526
00:19:00,765 --> 00:19:02,058
How's this?

527
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:03,768
What I'm going to do for you,
Michael,

528
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:08,522
is, I am going to go there
with you for moral support

529
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:10,274
and I will act as your assistant

530
00:19:10,316 --> 00:19:13,319
and maybe I'll do
my famous gay character.

531
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,195
I don't think you've seen
that character.

532
00:19:15,237 --> 00:19:16,990
I think I have.

533
00:19:17,031 --> 00:19:20,701
Mm... I don't think so.

534
00:19:22,328 --> 00:19:23,663
NARRATOR:
<i>The next day Michael sat down</i>

535
00:19:23,704 --> 00:19:27,374
<i>for a one-on-one meeting</i>
<i>with Ron Howard</i>

536
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:28,835
<i>-at Imagine.</i> 
-Hi, thank you for seeing me.

537
00:19:28,876 --> 00:19:30,586
Oh, well, that's fine, but

538
00:19:30,628 --> 00:19:33,881
I should warn you, this is what
I call a haircut meeting, so

539
00:19:33,923 --> 00:19:35,967
-we probably don't have
much time. -Okay.

540
00:19:36,009 --> 00:19:37,677
It would be so much better
if we could just lose

541
00:19:37,718 --> 00:19:39,345
-the baseball cap.
-We go through this every time.

542
00:19:39,386 --> 00:19:41,055
This is a hat-on haircut,

543
00:19:41,097 --> 00:19:42,932
so you just cut
what they can see.

544
00:19:42,974 --> 00:19:44,100
You got it, Floyd?

545
00:19:44,142 --> 00:19:45,101
I call all my barbers Floyd.

546
00:19:45,143 --> 00:19:46,393
I'm gonna make this quick.

547
00:19:46,435 --> 00:19:47,645
(Tobias clearing throat)

548
00:19:49,689 --> 00:19:51,858
Are you not going
to introduce me?

549
00:19:51,899 --> 00:19:53,860
Thought you were going
to wait in the lobby.

550
00:19:53,901 --> 00:19:55,111
Tobias Funke.

551
00:19:55,153 --> 00:19:56,236
I am a producer as well.

552
00:19:56,278 --> 00:19:58,739
-Hey.
-But I'm also an actor.

553
00:19:58,781 --> 00:20:00,074
That's probably
what confused you.

554
00:20:00,116 --> 00:20:02,076
Um, I've done
several inmate roles

555
00:20:02,118 --> 00:20:04,370
as well as a couple
of "And as it is such,

556
00:20:04,411 --> 00:20:06,622
so also as such is it
unto you"s,

557
00:20:06,664 --> 00:20:08,916
but I'll get to you after.

558
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:10,626
Well, that's terrific.

559
00:20:10,668 --> 00:20:12,670
-Do you notice that he's already
on my neck hair? -Yes.

560
00:20:12,712 --> 00:20:14,463
Last time I was in here,
we talked about,

561
00:20:14,505 --> 00:20:16,382
I wouldn't come back until I had
all the release signatures.

562
00:20:16,423 --> 00:20:18,217
-I wanted to give you
an update on that. -Terrific.

563
00:20:18,258 --> 00:20:20,260
You can just leave 'em
on Louisa's desk.

564
00:20:20,302 --> 00:20:22,304
What-- but that, uh,
that's the update.

565
00:20:22,346 --> 00:20:24,264
I don't have them.

566
00:20:24,306 --> 00:20:26,059
FLOYD:
Done.

567
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:27,560
Okay, well, thanks for coming.

568
00:20:27,601 --> 00:20:29,311
Well, um...

569
00:20:29,353 --> 00:20:31,230
-Don't you have something else
you wanted to say? -Yeah.

570
00:20:31,271 --> 00:20:33,066
If not, I'll do mine.

571
00:20:33,107 --> 00:20:35,275
No, no, no.
What? I don't...

572
00:20:35,317 --> 00:20:36,986
(sighs)
Ron,

573
00:20:37,028 --> 00:20:39,655
I care about someone deeply
and I think

574
00:20:39,697 --> 00:20:41,866
that you may also care
about this person.

575
00:20:41,908 --> 00:20:43,701
Hey, that's terrific.

576
00:20:43,743 --> 00:20:46,120
It's Rebel-- Rebel Alley,

577
00:20:46,162 --> 00:20:49,874
and she thinks that you're going
to always be in her life.

578
00:20:49,916 --> 00:20:52,085
I'm glad to know
she thinks that.

579
00:20:52,126 --> 00:20:54,212
-Yeah. -Tell him
how you feel about her.

580
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:56,047
Yeah, I-- you know,
I'm crazy about her,

581
00:20:56,089 --> 00:20:58,549
and, and I just-- I'm not going
to be able to do anything

582
00:20:58,591 --> 00:21:02,178
about that until you let her go.

583
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:03,763
-She's my little num-num.
-Sure.

584
00:21:03,804 --> 00:21:05,139
-You understand what I'm saying?
-Of course.

585
00:21:05,181 --> 00:21:07,058
I-I've changed her,
I've bathed her.

586
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:09,309
Well, now you want to bathe her.

587
00:21:09,351 --> 00:21:11,604
Yeah, it's, it's my time
to bathe her.

588
00:21:11,645 --> 00:21:12,980
She should be your num-num.

589
00:21:13,022 --> 00:21:15,775
She should be my num-num,
and you've got

590
00:21:15,816 --> 00:21:18,945
to just let her go, I think,
once and for all.

591
00:21:18,986 --> 00:21:20,821
You know, a father doesn't
really like to hear that

592
00:21:20,863 --> 00:21:22,322
when it comes to his daughter.

593
00:21:22,364 --> 00:21:24,408
I haven't had a chance
to talk to her father.

594
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:26,077
Yeah, I have,
I have not yet had a chance

595
00:21:26,119 --> 00:21:27,620
to talk to her father, but...

596
00:21:27,661 --> 00:21:30,497
No, no, I was,
I was saying that.

597
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:33,667
Because you are talking
to her father.

598
00:21:47,014 --> 00:21:50,434
Did you not know
that I'm Rebel's dad?

599
00:21:51,393 --> 00:21:53,479
I knew that part.

600
00:21:56,983 --> 00:21:59,068
But I, I also--

601
00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:03,530
I thought that, that, that,
that you might also be...

602
00:22:03,572 --> 00:22:05,699
her...

603
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:10,079
Her lover?

604
00:22:10,121 --> 00:22:11,914
-No.
-Well,

605
00:22:11,956 --> 00:22:14,333
this is hardly an episode
of<i> Happy Days.</i>

606
00:22:14,374 --> 00:22:15,626
I get it.

607
00:22:15,668 --> 00:22:17,544
I was arrested
as a sex offender,

608
00:22:17,586 --> 00:22:19,546
but at least I knew
it was my daughter

609
00:22:19,588 --> 00:22:22,133
-I was arrested for coming on
to. -(chuckles nervously)

610
00:22:22,175 --> 00:22:24,343
Now, about my project,
it's a family piece.

611
00:22:24,384 --> 00:22:26,262
Does this mean
our project is dead?

612
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:30,016
Listen, I never let personal
matters interfere with business.

613
00:22:30,057 --> 00:22:33,019
However, you should know
she's dating someone else, and

614
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:34,520
I'll do everything in my power
to make sure

615
00:22:34,561 --> 00:22:36,063
she never dates you again.

616
00:22:36,105 --> 00:22:38,149
Incredibly fair of you.

617
00:22:38,191 --> 00:22:40,860
Well, that was
a merry mix-up, eh? (chuckles)

618
00:22:40,901 --> 00:22:42,820
Now, about my project--

619
00:22:42,862 --> 00:22:45,072
it's based on something
that you produced in '92--

620
00:22:45,114 --> 00:22:46,949
<i>The Fantastic Four.</i>

621
00:22:46,991 --> 00:22:49,243
-Well, that was a favor that I
did for Fox. -Well, it turns out

622
00:22:49,285 --> 00:22:53,122
that one of the leads, DeBrie,
played Sue Storm.

623
00:22:53,164 --> 00:22:54,874
In fact, she is the leading lady

624
00:22:54,915 --> 00:22:59,128
in my production
of<i> Fantastic Four: The Musical,</i>

625
00:22:59,170 --> 00:23:01,881
which, with a wave
of your little pink hand,

626
00:23:01,922 --> 00:23:03,423
you could make happen,

627
00:23:03,465 --> 00:23:04,967
and then I'd owe you one.

628
00:23:05,009 --> 00:23:07,970
Well, uh, thanks,
but, uh, I couldn't do that.

629
00:23:08,012 --> 00:23:10,264
It, it would just be
so incredibly meaningful

630
00:23:10,306 --> 00:23:12,390
an-an-and change so many lives.

631
00:23:12,432 --> 00:23:14,601
I can't do it, but...

632
00:23:15,477 --> 00:23:17,646
...I also don't want to.

633
00:23:17,688 --> 00:23:20,440
(laughing)

634
00:23:24,028 --> 00:23:25,445
You are ruining my life,
Ron Howard!

635
00:23:25,487 --> 00:23:26,613
No, no, no, no, no, no.

636
00:23:26,655 --> 00:23:28,366
-No, no, no, no...
-You're ruining... -Aah, Louisa!

637
00:23:31,244 --> 00:23:34,038
I'm gonna start wearing a hat
when I get my hair cut, too.

638
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,581
What is wrong with you?

639
00:23:35,622 --> 00:23:39,168
You knew that Ron Howard was
Rebel Alley's father?

640
00:23:39,210 --> 00:23:41,003
Yes, everyone does.

641
00:23:41,045 --> 00:23:43,005
I didn't realize that's who
you thought the other man was,

642
00:23:43,047 --> 00:23:45,258
but the good news is,
at least one of our projects

643
00:23:45,299 --> 00:23:48,719
is still going, which, by the
way, I haven't signed this yet.

644
00:23:48,761 --> 00:23:49,929
Should I?

645
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:53,349
Yes, absolutely, thank you.

646
00:23:53,391 --> 00:23:56,476
Okay, my movie rights.

649

650
00:24:03,943 --> 00:24:06,153
Thank you.

651
00:24:06,195 --> 00:24:07,280

<i>someone to mother.</i>

680
00:25:06,755 --> 00:25:09,216
No<i> one</i> can reach me.

681
00:25:09,258 --> 00:25:11,135
No<i> one</i> can reach me?

682
00:25:11,177 --> 00:25:12,594
Is that how she's going
to say that line?

683
00:25:12,636 --> 00:25:14,388
No<i> one</i> can reach me?

684
00:25:14,430 --> 00:25:17,266
NARRATOR:<i> But all the pressure</i>
<i>was compelling DeBrie</i>

685
00:25:17,308 --> 00:25:18,476
<i>to think about a slip.</i>

686
00:25:18,516 --> 00:25:20,269
♪ Fantastic Four. ♪

687
00:25:20,311 --> 00:25:23,939
Maybe they should retitle this
<i>Fantastic Three and Lousy One.</i>

688
00:25:23,981 --> 00:25:24,898
(laughs)

689
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:26,275
Oh, that's my bad...

690
00:25:26,317 --> 00:25:27,360
-(group gasps)
-TOBIAS: Oh, DeBrie.

691
00:25:27,401 --> 00:25:30,196
Or ankle or knee.

692
00:25:30,237 --> 00:25:32,114
I think I need some drugs.

693
00:25:32,156 --> 00:25:35,159
No, it's okay, that's okay,
no drugs are necessary.

694
00:25:35,201 --> 00:25:37,870
We all want drugs,
but that's a no-no, yes?

695
00:25:37,911 --> 00:25:41,081
NARRATOR:<i> And soon it was</i>
<i>the night of their big show,</i>

696
00:25:41,123 --> 00:25:42,833
<i>and Tobias</i>
<i>and his ragtag troupe</i>

697
00:25:42,875 --> 00:25:44,418
<i>of substance abusers showed up</i>

698
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:47,004
<i>for their big moment on stage.</i>

699
00:25:47,046 --> 00:25:49,923
In case you didn't know,
the stage adds seven pounds.

700
00:25:49,965 --> 00:25:52,301
Two words: diet pills.

701
00:25:52,343 --> 00:25:53,927
(whispering):
Do you have any?

702
00:25:53,969 --> 00:25:55,262
Lucille, please.

703
00:25:55,304 --> 00:25:56,889
Okay, Fan Four, company meeting.

704
00:25:56,930 --> 00:25:58,724
Now, I know everybody
has made a commitment

705
00:25:58,765 --> 00:26:01,060
to stay in the program
for at least 30 more days,

706
00:26:01,101 --> 00:26:02,936
but I think we can all afford
one night

707
00:26:02,978 --> 00:26:04,730
of intense pressure, yes?

708
00:26:04,771 --> 00:26:06,482
We're all hoofers--
we can take the pressure, huh?

709
00:26:06,524 --> 00:26:09,485
Argyle, not helping, okay?

710
00:26:09,527 --> 00:26:11,445
(clanging)

711
00:26:11,487 --> 00:26:12,821
Does anybody have any questions?

712
00:26:12,863 --> 00:26:15,657
Yeah, I got a question-- you're
sure the Hispanic community

713
00:26:15,699 --> 00:26:17,159
is okay with all of this?

714
00:26:17,201 --> 00:26:19,786
Hmm, I'm sure they think of this
as an homage.

715
00:26:19,828 --> 00:26:22,706
Yes. Okay, well, I'm going to go
put on my rock monster outfit

716
00:26:22,748 --> 00:26:24,250
and pass out some fliers.

717
00:26:24,291 --> 00:26:25,751
You can take any boat
to the float.

718
00:26:25,792 --> 00:26:27,378
Oh, Tobias.

719
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:28,586
I don't think I can do this.

720
00:26:28,628 --> 00:26:31,424
You can do anything
I want you to do.

721
00:26:31,465 --> 00:26:33,633
And-and you want to do as well.

722
00:26:33,675 --> 00:26:35,428
We need this.

723
00:26:35,469 --> 00:26:37,430
This will make
all our old dreams come true.

724
00:26:37,471 --> 00:26:39,557
But maybe they're old
for a reason.

725
00:26:39,597 --> 00:26:42,518
Oh, you're focusing
on the wrong words.

726
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:44,353
If we can get through tonight,
DeBrie,

727
00:26:44,395 --> 00:26:45,812
we can get through anything.

728
00:26:45,854 --> 00:26:47,147
Don't worry about it.

729
00:26:47,189 --> 00:26:48,982
The audience will be
completely drunk,

730
00:26:49,024 --> 00:26:50,901
and if we're not perfect,
they'll take it out on us,

731
00:26:50,943 --> 00:26:53,237
but... that's why you're going
to be perfect.

732
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:54,780
You have to be perfect.

733
00:26:54,821 --> 00:26:56,323
-(laughs): Okay.
-(shudders): Okay.

734
00:26:56,365 --> 00:26:58,158
-All right.
<i>-But Tobias was about</i>

735
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:01,120
<i>to discover a situation</i>
<i>that was less than perfect.</i>

736
00:27:01,161 --> 00:27:03,539
-What?! Oh, no.
-CHILD: Fantastic Four!

737
00:27:03,581 --> 00:27:05,583
Who would bring kids here?
This is no place for...

738
00:27:05,623 --> 00:27:07,625
I'm a registered sex offender.

739
00:27:07,667 --> 00:27:08,835
All right.

740
00:27:08,877 --> 00:27:10,087
I'm a registered...

741
00:27:10,129 --> 00:27:11,297
I'm a registered sex offender.

742
00:27:11,338 --> 00:27:13,048
I'm a registered
sex offender.

743
00:27:13,090 --> 00:27:15,426
<i>Tobias knew that wearing</i>
<i>the Thing outfit</i>

744
00:27:15,468 --> 00:27:17,719
<i>would only make him</i>
<i>more recognizable,</i>

745
00:27:17,761 --> 00:27:20,097
<i>-so he was at a loss.</i> 
-Fantastic Four!

746
00:27:20,139 --> 00:27:22,891
<i>-DeBrie was also at a loss.</i> 
-Okay, okay.

747
00:27:22,933 --> 00:27:24,684
<i>Feeling frightened and fragile,</i>

748
00:27:24,726 --> 00:27:28,021
<i>she tried to keep it together</i>
<i>in a very slippery place.</i>

749
00:27:28,063 --> 00:27:29,898
<i>And she probably would have</i>
<i>made it,</i>

750
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:33,068
<i>if the calming waves</i>
<i>she was looking at</i>

751
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:35,028
<i>weren't down current</i>
<i>from where Dr. Norman</i>

752
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:37,072
<i>was flushing away the remains</i>
<i>of his medical career.</i>

753
00:27:37,114 --> 00:27:41,118
<i>And so DeBrie, who had been</i>
<i>in the safe harbor</i>

754
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:42,995
<i>of a drug-free zone,</i>
<i>found herself</i>

755
00:27:43,036 --> 00:27:45,956
<i>in the free drug zone</i>
<i>of an unsafe harbor.</i>

756
00:27:45,998 --> 00:27:49,793
<i>And that's when fate dealt</i>
<i>Tobias a new hand.</i>

757
00:27:49,835 --> 00:27:51,587
Buster. Oh, thank God.
I need your help.

758
00:27:51,629 --> 00:27:53,130
I've got a show to do
in ten minutes and I haven't got

759
00:27:53,172 --> 00:27:55,882
a thing to wear...
this Thing suit.

760
00:27:55,924 --> 00:27:57,635
<i>And that's how Buster</i>
<i>was drafted</i>

761
00:27:57,675 --> 00:28:00,471
<i>to be in Tobias' musical.</i>

762
00:28:00,513 --> 00:28:02,515
You're a monster,
you don't have to be good.

763
00:28:02,556 --> 00:28:04,975
-What?<i> -It wasn't a great</i>
<i>choice of words.</i>

764
00:28:05,017 --> 00:28:07,603
Butch it up
and sing your heart out.

765
00:28:07,645 --> 00:28:09,396
<i>-Having recast the Thing,</i> 
-DeBrie! DeBrie?

766
00:28:09,438 --> 00:28:11,231
<i>Tobias returned to check</i>
<i>on his leading lady.</i>

767
00:28:11,273 --> 00:28:13,150
(laughs): No, I'm looking
for a woman named DeBrie.

768
00:28:13,192 --> 00:28:15,569
DeBrie!

769
00:28:15,611 --> 00:28:16,820
Fantastic Four!

770
00:28:16,862 --> 00:28:18,280
Have you been drinking?

771
00:28:18,322 --> 00:28:21,992
No... it's pills.

772
00:28:22,034 --> 00:28:24,286
How could you do this to me?

773
00:28:24,328 --> 00:28:27,705
Or did I do this to you?

774
00:28:27,747 --> 00:28:29,124
You to me.

775
00:28:29,166 --> 00:28:31,877
I should have left you happy
and healthy and sober

776
00:28:31,918 --> 00:28:34,672
in that rehab instead of trying
to rekindle the career

777
00:28:34,712 --> 00:28:36,674
that brought you there
in the first place.

778
00:28:36,714 --> 00:28:38,884
LUCILLE 2:
Is she drunk?

779
00:28:38,925 --> 00:28:40,344
TOBIAS:
Uh, no.

780
00:28:40,386 --> 00:28:43,180
-It's pills.
-Eh.

781
00:28:43,222 --> 00:28:44,682
Can I talk to you for a second?

782
00:28:44,723 --> 00:28:47,267
Yes. Uh, yes. Yes.

783
00:28:47,309 --> 00:28:49,228
LUCILLE 2:
That is unacceptable.

784
00:28:49,269 --> 00:28:52,398
Patients doing pills
on a literal pile of garbage,

785
00:28:52,439 --> 00:28:54,274
that's not what we're about
at Austerity.

786
00:28:54,316 --> 00:28:56,610
Where's Argyle?
It's his...

787
00:28:56,652 --> 00:28:58,362
I can't let you blame Argyle
for this.

788
00:28:58,404 --> 00:29:00,614
It would destroy his confidence
and he's a little shaky

789
00:29:00,656 --> 00:29:02,949
on the lyrics as it is.

790
00:29:02,991 --> 00:29:04,618
He's not very good.

791
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:05,952
Fine, then I blame you.

792
00:29:05,994 --> 00:29:07,663
Someone has to pay for this.

793
00:29:07,705 --> 00:29:10,207
You're putting Austerity
in jeopardy.

794
00:29:10,249 --> 00:29:11,458
You're out!

795
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:13,877
No, don't fire me. I'm on
a work-release program.

796
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:15,170
If you fire me, then I have
to go back to prison.

797
00:29:15,212 --> 00:29:16,463
I can't go to prison.

798
00:29:16,505 --> 00:29:18,924
And you're investing
in this show.

799
00:29:18,965 --> 00:29:20,593
What if we get killer notices?

800
00:29:20,634 --> 00:29:22,386
We'll talk about it on Monday.

801
00:29:22,428 --> 00:29:23,970
Now, get rid of her

802
00:29:24,012 --> 00:29:26,724
before someone sees her
with their camera phone.

803
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:28,726
You know they have those
nowadays.

804
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:35,023
So I've got until Monday
to fix this.

805
00:29:35,065 --> 00:29:38,151
(breathy laugh)

806
00:29:38,193 --> 00:29:41,863
(laughing)

807
00:29:43,407 --> 00:29:48,328
That red-haired lady can't throw
her wad at that guy.

808
00:29:48,370 --> 00:29:50,038
Oh, DeBrie.

809
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:51,624
<i>But on the other side</i>
<i>of the Dumpster,</i>

810
00:29:51,665 --> 00:29:54,293
<i>things hadn't been</i>
<i>so laughable.</i>

811
00:29:54,334 --> 00:29:56,420
Hi, honey.
Are you in the play?

812
00:29:56,462 --> 00:29:57,921
-Yeah.
-What is the play, honey?

813
00:29:57,963 --> 00:29:59,673
<i>Fantastic Three</i>

814
00:29:59,715 --> 00:30:01,300
<i>and Lousy One,</i>

815
00:30:01,341 --> 00:30:02,342
so<i> Four.</i>

816
00:30:02,384 --> 00:30:03,510
-Four?
-Yeah.

817
00:30:03,552 --> 00:30:04,595
And who do you play?

818
00:30:04,637 --> 00:30:05,845
Sue Storm.

819
00:30:05,887 --> 00:30:07,640
Okay, Sue Storm
and the Fantastic Four

820
00:30:07,681 --> 00:30:10,517
are both trademarked by the
Marvel Entertainment LLC.

821
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:12,311
This is a cease and desist
letter.

822
00:30:12,352 --> 00:30:15,147
If you violate it, you will go
to prison for a long, long time.

823
00:30:15,188 --> 00:30:17,899
And you certainly can't wear
a four in a logo.

824
00:30:17,941 --> 00:30:19,318
<i>In fact, it wasn't even Marvel</i>

825
00:30:19,359 --> 00:30:21,236
<i>that owned the four</i>
<i>in a circle.</i>

826
00:30:21,278 --> 00:30:23,489
<i>It was trademarked</i>
<i>by the Four Feinbergs.</i>

827
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:25,865
Hey, can anyone just throw
one of these little Mexico

828
00:30:25,907 --> 00:30:27,951
-guitars off the dock?
-I don't want to go to prison.

829
00:30:27,993 --> 00:30:30,162
I'm going to do it.

830
00:30:32,914 --> 00:30:35,584
Well, Lucille 2 has threatened
me with prison,

831
00:30:35,626 --> 00:30:38,044
but it's going to take more than
one prison threat...

832
00:30:38,086 --> 00:30:40,547
Oh, you got one, too.

833
00:30:40,589 --> 00:30:42,174
Well, universe,
you seem to be putting up

834
00:30:42,215 --> 00:30:44,092
all sorts of walls between me
and my dreams.

835
00:30:44,134 --> 00:30:45,636
Today.

836
00:30:45,678 --> 00:30:48,472
Well, if we have any chance
of beating this,

837
00:30:48,514 --> 00:30:50,766
it's by putting on
the best show possible.

838
00:30:50,808 --> 00:30:52,976
A real wowzer.

839
00:30:53,018 --> 00:30:55,270
I just need to find a Sue Storm.

840
00:30:55,312 --> 00:30:58,482
(sighs):
I guess I'll need this.

841
00:30:58,524 --> 00:31:01,234
Before I go any further
with this,

842
00:31:01,276 --> 00:31:03,654
there's no way a hot cup
of coffee and a

843
00:31:03,696 --> 00:31:05,989
glass of "the show must
go on" spirit

844
00:31:06,031 --> 00:31:08,701
will encourage you in any way,
will it?

845
00:31:08,742 --> 00:31:10,703
Let me die.

846
00:31:10,744 --> 00:31:12,996
(Tobias sighs)

847
00:31:13,038 --> 00:31:17,000
No, you're not in any shape
to go out and perform tonight.

848
00:31:17,042 --> 00:31:20,212
<i>Tobias knew he couldn't leave</i>
<i>DeBrie in the trash</i>

849
00:31:20,253 --> 00:31:21,921
<i>in a highly trafficked area,</i>

850
00:31:21,963 --> 00:31:24,591
<i>but also knew he had a show</i>
<i>to put on.</i>

851
00:31:24,633 --> 00:31:28,303
<i>And so he went off to search</i>
<i>for any Sue Storm in the port.</i>

852
00:31:28,345 --> 00:31:31,849
<i>And when the search proved</i>
<i>unsuccessful,</i>

853
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:34,934
<i>he ended up finding one</i>
<i>inside himself.</i>

854
00:31:34,976 --> 00:31:37,937
Time to channel
my inner Storm.

855
00:31:37,979 --> 00:31:40,399
<i>And because he didn't have</i>
<i>the costume,</i>

856
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:42,359
<i>he created one</i>
<i>out of some makeup</i>

857
00:31:42,401 --> 00:31:45,111
<i>he'd always had</i>
<i>in case he got a call.</i>

858
00:31:45,153 --> 00:31:47,947
<i>And perhaps it was his muscle</i>
<i>memory that led to this.</i>

859
00:31:47,989 --> 00:31:52,327
Tobias, what are you doing?

860
00:31:52,369 --> 00:31:54,747
Oh. Pardon the mess.

861
00:31:54,788 --> 00:31:58,542
I just blue myself for the first
time in five years.

862
00:31:58,584 --> 00:32:01,294
(falsetto): Excuse me.
Make way for Sue Storm.

863
00:32:01,336 --> 00:32:04,047
<i>And now the almost invisible</i>
<i>Invisible Girl,</i>

864
00:32:04,089 --> 00:32:07,175
<i>got on the boat to head</i>
<i>to the floating stage.</i>

865
00:32:07,217 --> 00:32:09,636
<i>Unfortunately,</i>
<i>and not for the first time,</i>

866
00:32:09,678 --> 00:32:12,765
<i>Tobias got on the wrong boat.</i>

867
00:32:12,806 --> 00:32:15,809
<i>Except this one</i>
<i>was piloted by a man</i>

868
00:32:15,851 --> 00:32:18,812
<i>who not only expected a woman</i>
<i>in disguise,</i>

869
00:32:18,854 --> 00:32:22,315
<i>but also had a real bad case</i>
<i>of face blindness.</i>

870
00:32:22,357 --> 00:32:25,569
<i>And as it turned out,</i>
<i>the woman he was expecting</i>

871
00:32:25,611 --> 00:32:27,446
<i>had just given a rousing speech</i>

872
00:32:27,487 --> 00:32:30,908
<i>and joined the Love campaign</i>
<i>as they took the message</i>

873
00:32:30,949 --> 00:32:35,036
<i>that Marky had vowed</i>
<i>to torpedo to the sea.</i>

874
00:32:35,078 --> 00:32:37,664
TOBIAS: I think this is going
to make quite a splash.
