00:00:16,224 --> 00:00:19,477
[narrator] <i>Gob Bluth had just been told</i>
<i>by his father</i>

2
00:00:19,602 --> 00:00:21,896
<i>to go to work for his younger brother.</i>

3
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:24,941
Thanks for the birthday card
that I never got from you

4
00:00:25,025 --> 00:00:26,609
for the last 40 years.

5
00:00:29,654 --> 00:00:30,530
What the hell?

6
00:00:30,697 --> 00:00:32,490
<i>And even though Michael was the one</i>

7
00:00:32,574 --> 00:00:33,825
<i>asked to do the favor...</i>

8
00:00:33,908 --> 00:00:34,743
What the hell?

9
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:38,079
<i>...it was Gob who felt he had</i>
<i>a cross to bear.</i>

10
00:00:39,748 --> 00:00:40,665
I got right of way...

11
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:43,251
<i>In fact, the long estranged brothers</i>

12
00:00:43,334 --> 00:00:45,503
<i>were secretly competitive .</i>
<i>with one another.</i>

13
00:00:46,212 --> 00:00:48,131
No... No, no.
My right of way.

14
00:00:48,256 --> 00:00:49,257
Okay.

15
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,682
-Gob.
-Michael.

16
00:00:57,766 --> 00:00:59,392
<i>Still, they reunited.</i>

17
00:00:59,517 --> 00:01:00,435
Hey, Gob.

18
00:01:00,602 --> 00:01:01,561
Michael.

19
00:01:01,644 --> 00:01:03,313
<i>...happy to see each other...</i>

20
00:01:03,438 --> 00:01:04,355
Gob?

21
00:01:04,981 --> 00:01:05,940
<i>...at first.</i>

22
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:07,776
Michael.

23
00:01:09,235 --> 00:01:12,238
So, hear you need help
moving these memorials

24
00:01:12,363 --> 00:01:15,742
-to the death of the housing market.
-[jaunty tune warbles]

25
00:01:17,285 --> 00:01:19,454
That's a memorial to the death
of Pete the mailman.

26
00:01:19,537 --> 00:01:20,371
I knew that.

27
00:01:20,455 --> 00:01:21,498
I brought one, too.

28
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:23,124
Size of the man's heart.

29
00:01:23,833 --> 00:01:26,252
I've just got to figure out
how to get it out of the car.

30
00:01:26,836 --> 00:01:29,214
If I could remember how I got it in.

31
00:01:29,714 --> 00:01:32,550
-That's not from your Christian magic act?
-"Christian magic act"?

32
00:01:32,634 --> 00:01:34,844
If I were Muslim,
would you say "Muslim magic act"?

33
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:35,929
No.

34
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:38,389
But it is hard to imagine any Muslim

35
00:01:38,473 --> 00:01:40,350
handcuffing himself to a glittery cross

36
00:01:40,433 --> 00:01:41,893
and living to tell about it.

37
00:01:42,143 --> 00:01:44,979
Yeah, well, the Christians
aren't so [beep] hot about it either.

38
00:01:48,191 --> 00:01:49,025
Well...

39
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:51,986
<i>Michael could see</i>
<i>that his brother was unhappy,</i>

40
00:01:52,237 --> 00:01:53,822
<i>and that his life had not worked out</i>

41
00:01:53,905 --> 00:01:54,948
<i>the way he had hoped.</i>

42
00:01:55,782 --> 00:01:58,576
Things are incredible for me.
I'm having an incredible year.

43
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:01,329
I am a movie producer now,
producing a movie.

44
00:02:01,496 --> 00:02:03,790
So they've got me in
this enormous office.

45
00:02:03,915 --> 00:02:06,501
Told 'em I don't wanna be driving
to Beverly Hills every single day,

46
00:02:06,584 --> 00:02:09,129
so they put me in an enormous office
just over here.

47
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:12,924
Rental.

48
00:02:13,716 --> 00:02:15,135
My personal life is off the charts.

49
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:16,761
I met someone.

50
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:19,180
Can't really give you any information.
Kind of famous-y.

51
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:21,182
Well, good for you. I also met someone.

52
00:02:21,307 --> 00:02:22,308
Also famous-y.

53
00:02:22,392 --> 00:02:23,810
Can't give you any information.

54
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:26,396
<i>In fact, Michael didn't even find out</i>

55
00:02:26,521 --> 00:02:28,356
<i>who she was until one night earlier.</i>

56
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:29,357
Oh, my God.

57
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,900
I'm dating Ron Howard's girlfriend.

58
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:33,361
<i>Although, he did have</i>
<i>some of the details wrong.</i>

59
00:02:33,486 --> 00:02:34,821
She's an actress.
You know her.

60
00:02:34,904 --> 00:02:37,157
<i>She was Ron's illegitimate daughter.</i>

61
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:39,409
<i>A fact unbeknownst to many.</i>

62
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:41,870
Well, we kind of like to keep that quiet.

63
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:43,621
I can give you information

64
00:02:43,705 --> 00:02:46,166
about your airless office
you're gonna be spending mornings in.

65
00:02:46,249 --> 00:02:48,293
You know what I could go for
is some guac.

66
00:02:48,376 --> 00:02:50,086
-You don't live there anymore.
-This heat...

67
00:02:50,211 --> 00:02:51,546
makes me want guac.

68
00:02:52,881 --> 00:02:55,091
<i>Now the story of what happened</i>

69
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:56,593
<i>when the one man who was</i>

70
00:02:56,676 --> 00:02:58,469
<i>holding his family together</i>

71
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:00,263
<i>finally let go...</i>

72
00:03:00,555 --> 00:03:03,933
<i>and the separate journeys</i>
<i>that eventually gave them no choice</i>

73
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:05,351
<i>but to come back together.</i>

74
00:03:05,435 --> 00:03:09,189
{\an8}<i>It's </i>Arrested Development:
Fateful Consequences.

75
00:03:14,569 --> 00:03:16,154
{\an8}Model home? More like model tomb.

76
00:03:16,237 --> 00:03:17,071
{\an8}Am I right?

77
00:03:17,155 --> 00:03:20,158
{\an8}<i>Michael and Gob reunited</i>
<i>after a long time apart.</i>

78
00:03:20,241 --> 00:03:21,618
{\an8}...meticulously maintained.

79
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:22,702
{\an8}[beep]

80
00:03:23,745 --> 00:03:24,704
{\an8}There are some vultures.

81
00:03:24,787 --> 00:03:26,206
{\an8}I think they might still smell Pete.

82
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,752
{\an8}If it wasn't for the movie thing,
I'd do it myself.

83
00:03:30,835 --> 00:03:33,421
{\an8}They practically sell themselves,
just got to bring the people in.

84
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:34,547
{\an8}I'm ready to move in today.

85
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:37,217
-No, people other than you.
-I'm starving.

86
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:39,385
{\an8}Starving? You won't find anything here.

87
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:40,595
{\an8}They've been abandoned for...

88
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:43,306
{\an8}Lindsay.

89
00:03:45,266 --> 00:03:46,434
{\an8}No, this...

90
00:03:46,935 --> 00:03:47,769
{\an8}Maybe Tobias?

91
00:03:47,852 --> 00:03:49,479
{\an8}<i>It was John Beard.</i>

92
00:03:49,604 --> 00:03:50,438
{\an8}Shall we?

93
00:03:50,688 --> 00:03:53,816
{\an8}Well, the value of these homes isn't
gonna go down if we don't sell one today.

94
00:03:53,983 --> 00:03:55,485
Let's see if I can find a...

95
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:57,570
Do you have a bottle opener?

96
00:03:58,238 --> 00:03:59,197
{\an8}Great idea.

97
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:01,115
<i>And after a few more drinks</i>

98
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:02,992
{\an8}<i>and a little more depreciation...</i>

99
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:05,078
{\an8}<i>Michael admitted he had a rival</i>

100
00:04:05,161 --> 00:04:06,162
{\an8}<i>for his girlfriend.</i>

101
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:08,456
{\an8}You don't have to worry
about Ron Howard.

102
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:09,958
{\an8}He's not competition for you.

103
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:10,917
Really?

104
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,585
{\an8}No, the guy's, like, 100 years old.

105
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:14,504
{\an8}What's he going to do,
poke you in the eyes?

106
00:04:14,587 --> 00:04:15,630
You're confused.

107
00:04:15,713 --> 00:04:17,298
Ron Howard directed  <i>Apollo 13.</i>

108
00:04:17,423 --> 00:04:18,549
You're thinking of Mo Howard,

109
00:04:18,633 --> 00:04:20,635
the angry Stooge, been dead
for a quarter century.

110
00:04:20,718 --> 00:04:22,637
That's good ,
cause the whole time I'm thinking,

111
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:24,681
"Unless she likes a guy who's funny..."

112
00:04:24,764 --> 00:04:25,974
-Sure.
-That guy is funny.

113
00:04:26,057 --> 00:04:28,601
{\an8}The whole time, you're like...
"Is he gonna poke me in the eyes?"

114
00:04:28,726 --> 00:04:30,353
{\an8}Gob, I don't think that the movie...

115
00:04:30,436 --> 00:04:31,562
{\an8}It might not even happen,

116
00:04:31,646 --> 00:04:33,856
{\an8}because I don't think that
I can ask my son...

117
00:04:33,982 --> 00:04:36,442
{\an8}What happened between him and me
was very disappointing.

118
00:04:36,526 --> 00:04:38,528
{\an8}Don't need to tell me
about disappointment and sons.

119
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:40,071
{\an8}Let's not forget Steve Holt.

120
00:04:40,154 --> 00:04:42,282
I was talking about a son
disappointing a father.

121
00:04:42,407 --> 00:04:43,866
Yeah, that does make it different.

122
00:04:44,534 --> 00:04:45,827
Show himÂ you're a big shot,

123
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:47,662
you don't need to live
in your son's dorm.

124
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:50,164
I just live in my parents' penthouse now.

125
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:51,499
Take him to the Ealing Club.

126
00:04:51,582 --> 00:04:53,876
It's all show biz.
I used to hang out there all the time.

127
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,378
It's actresses and stuff like that.

128
00:04:55,503 --> 00:04:58,047
I don't know if I could pick up the phone
and call him and ask him.

129
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:00,300
You know what, Michael?

130
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:01,634
I'll call him for you.

131
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:04,971
You'd do that for me?

132
00:05:05,221 --> 00:05:06,180
It's the least I can do.

133
00:05:07,015 --> 00:05:08,516
You've given me a new sense of purpose.

134
00:05:08,599 --> 00:05:10,476
I don't want you to
get your hopes up.

135
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,646
When I said that these places
sell themselves,

136
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:15,690
I should have gone on to say,
you know, that...

137
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:18,609
No, they don't.

138
00:05:19,235 --> 00:05:20,903
I mean destroying Tony Wonder.

139
00:05:21,529 --> 00:05:24,032
I'm going to destroy his career
the same way he destroyed mine.

140
00:05:24,365 --> 00:05:27,285
<i>Gob was referring to an escape act</i>
<i>he'd performed</i>

141
00:05:27,368 --> 00:05:29,912
<i>that had failed when the hidden</i>
<i>compartment that held</i>

142
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:32,373
<i>the keys to his escape hadn't opened...</i>

143
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:35,001
<i>...humiliating him in</i>
<i>front of his bride...</i>

144
00:05:35,877 --> 00:05:36,836
He's not coming back.

145
00:05:36,919 --> 00:05:37,754
<i>Her...</i>

146
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:39,422
<i>and all of Christendom.</i>

147
00:05:39,505 --> 00:05:41,924
Destroying Tony Wonder
is your sense of purpose?

148
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:43,468
I thought you said thanks to me...

149
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:45,136
He's performing
at a gay club tonight,

150
00:05:45,219 --> 00:05:47,221
and I need you as my boyfriend
to help me get in.

151
00:05:47,305 --> 00:05:48,973
I'm gonna say no, thank you.

152
00:05:49,223 --> 00:05:50,892
Don't you think
it's a little inappropriate?

153
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:51,893
I am your brother.

154
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:53,311
You sound like my son.

155
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:56,356
{\an8}<i>Whom Gob had spoken to earlier that day.</i>

156
00:05:56,731 --> 00:05:58,107
<i>Her name's Ann, by the way.</i>

157
00:05:58,232 --> 00:05:59,692
Hey, you remembered.

158
00:06:01,235 --> 00:06:03,237
How about you and I
go to a magic show together?

159
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:05,073
I love magic, of course.

160
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:07,825
It'd be sort of a father-son thing...

161
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:08,910
at a gay club.

162
00:06:08,993 --> 00:06:11,079
<i>Well, technically a gay night</i>
<i>at a magic club.</i>

163
00:06:11,162 --> 00:06:12,330
<i>Hey, you know what'd be funny?</i>

164
00:06:12,413 --> 00:06:13,998
If you pretended to be my boyfriend

165
00:06:14,624 --> 00:06:16,542
<i>so I could lock this guy Tony Wonder...</i>

166
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:17,585
I don't know,

167
00:06:17,668 --> 00:06:19,712
I don't think this whole thing
is a good idea.

168
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:22,048
<i>Besides, last time we tried</i>
<i>to do something together,</i>

169
00:06:22,131 --> 00:06:24,092
-you didn't even show up.
<i>-What about you?</i>

170
00:06:24,634 --> 00:06:26,928
I didn't even hear from you
for your entire childhood.

171
00:06:27,011 --> 00:06:29,013
Then thanks for the birthday card

172
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:30,348
that I never got from you

173
00:06:30,431 --> 00:06:32,016
for the last 40 years.

174
00:06:33,142 --> 00:06:35,561
<i>This was extra hard for Steve to hear</i>

175
00:06:35,645 --> 00:06:36,896
<i>on his actual birthday.</i>

176
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,398
So what do I owe you?

177
00:06:38,981 --> 00:06:39,816
There you go.

178
00:06:40,691 --> 00:06:43,027
That's funny, I used to
date a guy named Steve Holt.

179
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:44,904
Steve Holt!

180
00:06:44,987 --> 00:06:46,280
Yeah, that's the guy.

181
00:06:51,577 --> 00:06:53,329
Heck of a birthday
this is shaping up to be.

182
00:06:53,496 --> 00:06:55,665
<i>In fact, it was about to get worse.</i>

183
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:03,131
And didn't you already try
locking Tony Wonder in his trick?

184
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:05,591
Yes, but that wasn't for revenge,
that was just on spec.

185
00:07:05,675 --> 00:07:06,759
<i>And it didn't work.</i>

186
00:07:07,552 --> 00:07:09,971
<i>Besides, that was before I knew</i>
<i>he had locked me in my trick.</i>

187
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:12,557
<i>You still don't know that he tried to</i>
<i>lock you in your trick.</i>

188
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,434
I do know, I have proof.

189
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:16,894
I went in that cave

190
00:07:16,978 --> 00:07:18,729
and I found this.

191
00:07:19,313 --> 00:07:20,690
We both know what that stands for.

192
00:07:20,773 --> 00:07:21,607
Jesus.

193
00:07:21,691 --> 00:07:23,276
No, that would be a "J".

194
00:07:23,359 --> 00:07:24,193
This is a "T".

195
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:25,778
Tony Wonder was there in the cave

196
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:27,572
the night that I did my big illusion.

197
00:07:27,905 --> 00:07:29,615
So, when I went yesterday to the cave

198
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:32,243
and I saw that this had
wedged my compartment door shut,

199
00:07:32,326 --> 00:07:33,453
I knew that I'd been wronged.

200
00:07:33,578 --> 00:07:34,412
Okay.

201
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:36,330
The only thing that
we know is that you

202
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:38,958
tried to lock Tony Wonder
in his trick first.

203
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:41,002
-Right? So you're even.
-No, no.

204
00:07:41,085 --> 00:07:42,545
Because mine didn't work.

205
00:07:42,628 --> 00:07:43,546
He got the last laugh,

206
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:44,630
which, in this case,

207
00:07:44,714 --> 00:07:45,965
happened to be
the first laugh.

208
00:07:46,048 --> 00:07:48,134
I don't understand why you can't
seem to follow me...

209
00:07:48,217 --> 00:07:50,428
You've got a chance to make a life here.

210
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:52,513
I'm offering you a good job,

211
00:07:53,097 --> 00:07:54,056
selling good homes,

212
00:07:54,348 --> 00:07:55,516
making real good money,

213
00:07:56,267 --> 00:07:59,312
and I'm not asking for anything in return.

214
00:08:00,396 --> 00:08:01,272
What is this?

215
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:03,983
I'm asking for something in return.

216
00:08:04,066 --> 00:08:05,026
This is for the movie.

217
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:06,652
For your life rights in perpetuity,

218
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:09,113
in the known universe and beyond.

219
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:10,823
Look at this.

220
00:08:11,407 --> 00:08:13,367
What's that mean?
You're not gonna sign it?

221
00:08:13,451 --> 00:08:16,537
No. I was just thinking that I should
have my attorney Bob Loblaw look at this.

222
00:08:16,621 --> 00:08:18,331
-He doesn't need to.
-I'm fine with it.

223
00:08:18,414 --> 00:08:19,457
It's boilerplate stuff.

224
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:22,126
-I'm gonna be in a movie.
-No, you're not.

225
00:08:23,753 --> 00:08:24,587
Okay.

226
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:31,010
<i>Gob was making good</i>

227
00:08:31,093 --> 00:08:33,221
<i>on a promise</i>
<i>he had made to Michael...</i>

228
00:08:33,304 --> 00:08:34,430
I need to see you tonight.

229
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:35,890
<i>...to talk to his son.</i>

230
00:08:35,973 --> 00:08:37,600
It's about your father and you.

231
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:40,228
Really, is he upset?

232
00:08:40,436 --> 00:08:41,771
<i>Do I seem like a clown to you?</i>

233
00:08:42,688 --> 00:08:43,523
I got it.

234
00:08:43,606 --> 00:08:45,983
Do I seem like some
kind of a clown to you?

235
00:08:46,067 --> 00:08:47,902
I got it, Uncle Gob. Just tell me where.

236
00:08:47,985 --> 00:08:50,029
Meet me tonight at theÂ Gothic Castle.

237
00:08:50,238 --> 00:08:51,405
I will.
The Gothic Castle?

238
00:08:51,489 --> 00:08:53,282
No, theÂ Gothic Asshole.

239
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:55,660
-Yes, the Gothic Castle.
<i>-I didn't say theÂ Gothic Asshole.</i>

240
00:08:55,743 --> 00:08:57,495
You think they call it the Gothic Asshole?

241
00:08:57,578 --> 00:08:59,622
<i>-I said the Gothic Castle.</i>
-It's theÂ Gothic Castle.

242
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:00,540
Okay.

243
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:04,335
-I think you look amazing.
-I'll take it.

244
00:09:05,169 --> 00:09:06,462
-Great.
-No, no.

245
00:09:06,587 --> 00:09:08,673
The compliment, not the shirt.

246
00:09:09,465 --> 00:09:12,468
<i>So, as Gob readied himself</i>
<i>for a magic show...</i>

247
00:09:12,635 --> 00:09:15,346
<i>Tobias began work on a show of his own.</i>

248
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:18,599
<i>to create the Fantastic Four  musical,</i>

249
00:09:18,683 --> 00:09:20,851
<i>that he himself wrote and directed.</i>

250
00:09:20,935 --> 00:09:22,687
The goal is that we all get
a little outing

251
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:24,146
on the Cinco de Cuatro,

252
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:26,399
where we'll be performing it on a boat.

253
00:09:26,482 --> 00:09:28,150
I hope no one gets seasick.

254
00:09:28,776 --> 00:09:32,363
{\an8}<i>Tobias had been working</i>
<i>at Lucille Austero's rehab clinic</i>

255
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:34,907
<i>as a therapist</i>
<i>for some Hollywood notables.</i>

256
00:09:34,991 --> 00:09:37,034
-Hi, I'm Mark.
<i>-From pop star Mark Cherry...</i>

257
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:40,746
But, please, first names only.

258
00:09:41,372 --> 00:09:42,248
Mark is my first name.

259
00:09:42,331 --> 00:09:43,374
Cherry's my last name.

260
00:09:43,457 --> 00:09:45,585
And Simon says, you're out.

261
00:09:49,714 --> 00:09:52,216
No. No, Mark Cherry,
I was having fun.

262
00:09:52,341 --> 00:09:53,509
I have a bit of a wit.

263
00:09:54,552 --> 00:09:58,139
Well, I think we all recognize
this gentleman.

264
00:09:59,056 --> 00:10:01,726
<i>...to celebrity side-kick, Andy Richter.</i>

265
00:10:01,976 --> 00:10:03,769
I'm not Andy fucking Richter.

266
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:05,646
<i>Correction...</i>

267
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:08,065
<i>the identical quintuplet brother</i>
<i>of Andy...</i>

268
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:08,983
I'm Emmett.

269
00:10:09,066 --> 00:10:10,818
<i>...who has withheld the use</i>
<i>of his likeness.</i>

270
00:10:10,901 --> 00:10:12,153
Emmett who?

271
00:10:12,236 --> 00:10:13,070
Richter.

272
00:10:13,195 --> 00:10:14,572
Simon says, you're out.

273
00:10:14,905 --> 00:10:16,324
But most notably of all...

274
00:10:16,407 --> 00:10:17,992
he reconnected with a woman

275
00:10:18,075 --> 00:10:19,827
-DeBrie!
-He'd loved and lost...

276
00:10:19,994 --> 00:10:21,287
How are you?

277
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:23,831
So, you two know each other?

278
00:10:23,998 --> 00:10:27,001
<i>Only to find out he was</i>
<i>about to lose her again.</i>

279
00:10:27,084 --> 00:10:29,378
...there is no way you
can be her therapist.

280
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:31,964
<i>And so Tobias found a way...</i>

281
00:10:32,089 --> 00:10:33,716
<i>to be with the woman he loved.</i>

282
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:36,135
I could direct, we could get
Mark Cherry to do the music,

283
00:10:36,218 --> 00:10:37,928
and we can cast it with patients.

284
00:10:38,012 --> 00:10:40,056
She was in the movie, <i>The Fantastic Four.</i>

285
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:42,141
I was in <i>The Fantasticks.</i>

286
00:10:42,266 --> 00:10:44,143
<i>And so it was decided.</i>

287
00:10:44,226 --> 00:10:46,854
And this'll make my stay shorter?
I'll get out of here a week sooner?

288
00:10:46,937 --> 00:10:49,398
Well, sobriety is
the most important thing,

289
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:51,692
but we'll see how good the music is.

290
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:53,653
<i>And so they set to work.</i>

291
00:10:53,736 --> 00:10:56,113
<i>And even though DeBrieÂ had some trouble</i>

292
00:10:56,197 --> 00:10:57,531
<i>with the choreography at first...</i>

293
00:10:58,407 --> 00:11:00,326
<i>Tobias knew</i> <i>she'd blow them away</i>

294
00:11:00,409 --> 00:11:02,286
<i>with her show stopping number</i>

295
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:03,954
<i>as the Invisible Girl.</i>

296
00:11:04,038 --> 00:11:06,457
<i>âª I don't want to be invisibleÂ âª</i>

297
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:10,461
<i>âª I don't want to be invisibleÂ âª</i>

298
00:11:10,628 --> 00:11:15,424
<i>âª I don't want to be invisible anymoreÂ âª</i>

299
00:11:15,549 --> 00:11:17,343
Okay, good. Get out there.

300
00:11:17,426 --> 00:11:19,345
All right. Okay.

301
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:20,846
I like this, too...

302
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:22,014
Where's Argyle?

303
00:11:22,306 --> 00:11:23,557
She's choreographing.

304
00:11:23,641 --> 00:11:24,725
Let's all do it too.

305
00:11:24,809 --> 00:11:27,019
It's called the thinking man's squat.

306
00:11:27,144 --> 00:11:29,146
[all moaning]

307
00:11:30,731 --> 00:11:32,441
Go with her. Go. Follow her.

308
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:34,193
<i>But if DeBrie was nervous...</i>

309
00:11:34,652 --> 00:11:35,695
Am I crazy...

310
00:11:36,654 --> 00:11:38,364
or is this really good?

311
00:11:38,447 --> 00:11:41,909
<i>...it was nothing compared to</i>
<i>how George Michael felt</i>

312
00:11:41,992 --> 00:11:44,787
<i>when he arrived to speak</i>
<i>with his uncle at the Gothic Castle.</i>

313
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:48,499
<i>which, that night, did resemble</i>
<i>the Gothic Asshole.</i>

314
00:11:48,624 --> 00:11:50,543
-Uncle Gob!
-Don't call me Uncle...

315
00:11:50,668 --> 00:11:52,169
Actually, that's good.
That works here.

316
00:11:52,294 --> 00:11:54,380
-Is my dad upset? What's going on?
-He's fine.

317
00:11:54,463 --> 00:11:56,257
You told me he wasÂ upset about something.

318
00:11:56,465 --> 00:11:57,383
I don't know.

319
00:11:57,675 --> 00:11:59,218
I do know that your daddy

320
00:11:59,301 --> 00:12:01,804
wants you to get your hot, little,
tight, little, hot ass

321
00:12:01,887 --> 00:12:05,933
-right up there right away to see him.
-You had me come all the way here

322
00:12:06,058 --> 00:12:07,560
to tell me my dad
wants me to meet him?

323
00:12:07,643 --> 00:12:08,686
Those things are unrelated.

324
00:12:08,769 --> 00:12:10,521
I'm trying to lock this guy, Tony,

325
00:12:10,604 --> 00:12:11,647
into this gay magic trick.

326
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:14,275
And I just needed
believable arm candy...

327
00:12:14,775 --> 00:12:17,111
I do know that your dad
is really upset with you.

328
00:12:17,194 --> 00:12:18,195
He's upset?

329
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:19,530
I asked you that.

330
00:12:19,613 --> 00:12:22,742
That was the first thing I asked you.
You're giving me these crazy...

331
00:12:23,826 --> 00:12:24,660
Mad?

332
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:26,954
-God, what is that inky taste?
-It's my stamp.

333
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:28,706
-I'm sorry about that.
-No, that's okay.

334
00:12:28,789 --> 00:12:30,332
I probably won't come back in.

335
00:12:30,624 --> 00:12:31,834
I'm gonna go see my dad.

336
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:34,003
Yeah, because you're a good son.

337
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:38,716
Bit my tongue...

338
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:39,633
Now get out of here.

339
00:12:39,717 --> 00:12:41,218
I never want to sleep with you again.

340
00:12:41,635 --> 00:12:45,181
<i>After successfully looking like</i>
<i>he'd had a fight with his boyfriend,</i>

341
00:12:46,557 --> 00:12:49,226
<i>and knowing that Tony would</i>
<i>go into the closet</i>

342
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:51,020
<i>and pop out of somewhere else,</i>

343
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:54,106
<i>Gob proceeded to lock</i>
<i>everything he could find.</i>

344
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:55,608

00:12:55,691 --> 00:12:57,610
<i>to watch his revenge play out.</i>

346
00:12:57,735 --> 00:12:59,612
[Tony] <i>A magician has many secrets,</i>

347
00:13:00,154 --> 00:13:02,323
<i>but there was one I was forced to keep,</i>

348
00:13:03,115 --> 00:13:04,033
<i>by society.</i>

349
00:13:05,868 --> 00:13:08,120
<i>"Don't talk to us," they said.</i>

350
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:11,832
<i>"Keep your hands to yourself,"</i>

351
00:13:12,082 --> 00:13:13,292
<i>they also said.</i>

352
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:17,087
[man] <i>Magic is only for straight men.</i>

353
00:13:25,513 --> 00:13:27,139
[Tony] <i>I don't want to look at you, son.</i>

354
00:13:27,681 --> 00:13:28,599
<i>Just go to work.</i>

355
00:13:28,724 --> 00:13:30,434
<i>Why can't you be like your brother?</i>

356
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:42,154
<i>Well, I'm here...</i>

357
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:43,697
<i>I'm queer,</i>

358
00:13:43,864 --> 00:13:45,115
<i>and now...</i>

359
00:13:45,866 --> 00:13:46,992
<i>I'm in a chair!</i>

360
00:13:47,368 --> 00:13:49,328
Did somebody say Wonder?

361
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:51,372
[narrator]
<i>Nobody actually did that time,</i>

362
00:13:51,455 --> 00:13:52,957
<i>but I think he got away with it.</i>

363
00:13:53,082 --> 00:13:54,458
Didn't expect to see you here.

364
00:13:54,542 --> 00:13:55,543
Want to get a drink later?

365
00:13:55,626 --> 00:13:57,920
<i>And believe it or not,</i>
<i>it was this trick...</i>

366
00:13:58,295 --> 00:13:59,797
Now everybody's gay!

367
00:14:00,172 --> 00:14:01,966
<i>...that really brought</i>
<i>the crowd to their feet.</i>

368
00:14:02,967 --> 00:14:04,593
<i>Although it was pretty easy</i>

369
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:06,095
<i>to figure out how he did it.</i>

370
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:07,346
<i>They started out gay.</i>

371
00:14:07,429 --> 00:14:08,430
You missed your cue.

372
00:14:13,602 --> 00:14:15,437
<i>Gob was having a drink with a man</i>

373
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:17,648
<i>he'd twice tried to sabotage.</i>

374
00:14:17,898 --> 00:14:20,276
Beanbag chair. I was wondering
what you were gonna pop out of.

375
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:21,694
Did somebody say "wonder"?

376
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:23,404
...ing?

377
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:25,656
I always try to stay one step ahead
of the audience.

378
00:14:25,781 --> 00:14:26,657
<i>Â¡Vamonos!</i>

379
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:32,621
Come on, man. Timing, right?

380
00:14:32,997 --> 00:14:33,956
Leave the mask.

381
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:35,249
Yeah, of course, mask.

382
00:14:35,332 --> 00:14:36,625
Yeah, that makes sense.

383
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:38,419
I use a mask myself,
in my act.

384
00:14:39,086 --> 00:14:41,130
You have to tell me how you do
that beanbag trick.

385
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:44,133
I guess, since you're a magician, too.
But not a word of this.

386
00:14:44,842 --> 00:14:46,260
I did use a mask.

387
00:14:46,343 --> 00:14:49,179
I put it on another guy
and I was in the beanbag.

388
00:14:49,513 --> 00:14:52,349
That's why they put that sign

389
00:14:52,433 --> 00:14:54,101
on the beanbag.
"Do not sit on this..."

390
00:14:54,184 --> 00:14:56,562
<i>And the magicians shared the secrets</i>

391
00:14:56,687 --> 00:14:58,814
<i>of their ancient and mystical craft.</i>

392
00:14:58,939 --> 00:15:00,900
And also it's very hard to get out of
at the end,

393
00:15:00,983 --> 00:15:01,859
when I appear.

394
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:03,611
So how have you been?

395
00:15:03,944 --> 00:15:07,197
I haven't seen you since your "wedding,"
when you did the Jesus gag.

396
00:15:07,781 --> 00:15:09,491
I guess you could say
I was a runaway groom.

397
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:12,661
It's okay, I know it didn't work.
It made the "Woops" column in <i>Poof.</i>

398
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:14,413
It's cool, though, man.
I've been there.

399
00:15:14,496 --> 00:15:15,956
Your assistant
probably sabotaged you.

400
00:15:16,123 --> 00:15:17,333
I don't even use one anymore.

401
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:18,918
I resorted to using my own legs

402
00:15:19,001 --> 00:15:20,377
in the Saw-the-Lady-in-Half gag.

403
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:22,504
I even shaved them.
Want to feel?

404
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:23,505
Sure.

405
00:15:24,048 --> 00:15:25,382
Wow, they are smooth.

406
00:15:25,466 --> 00:15:26,508
Like a lady's.

407
00:15:27,009 --> 00:15:28,052
I think.

408
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:32,097
You're funny.

409
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:33,641
Too bad we can't do this more.

410
00:15:33,974 --> 00:15:35,684
I dunno if it'd be great
for my reputation

411
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:38,187
to be seen with
a fundamentalist Christian magician.

412
00:15:38,312 --> 00:15:39,730
<i>And he was suspicious</i>

413
00:15:39,813 --> 00:15:42,107
<i>that Gob might not be gay.</i>

414
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:44,693
<i>Although, the fact</i>
<i>that he borrowed Tobias' car...</i>

415
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:46,153
...with the license plate ANUSTART.

416
00:15:46,236 --> 00:15:48,822
-That's me.
<i>-...alleviated some of those concerns.</i>

417
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:49,949
What the hell?
Let's do it.

418
00:15:54,662 --> 00:15:56,747
<i>And the next day, Tobias returned</i>

419
00:15:56,872 --> 00:15:57,998
<i>to the model home.</i>

420
00:15:58,082 --> 00:16:00,584
Beard, I'm only here
to pick up my car keys.

421
00:16:01,585 --> 00:16:02,711
Tobias?

422
00:16:03,128 --> 00:16:03,963
Gob?

423
00:16:07,424 --> 00:16:09,468
Good to see you, old friend.
What have you been up to?

424
00:16:10,761 --> 00:16:11,971
Things are good, nothing much.

425
00:16:12,054 --> 00:16:14,014
I'm a registered sex offender,
but things are good.

426
00:16:14,098 --> 00:16:15,015
Yes.

427
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:17,142
And I'm working at
Lucille Two's rehab center,

428
00:16:17,226 --> 00:16:18,060
the one she owns,

429
00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:20,479
not the one she famously
went to 12 times.

430
00:16:20,604 --> 00:16:22,314
Can we finish over breakfast?
I'm starving.

431
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:24,233
Is it finishing? Okay.

432
00:16:24,316 --> 00:16:25,901
<i>And the two friends caught up.</i>

433
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:29,029
If I wouldn't have gotten arrested,
I wouldn't have ended up working at rehab,

434
00:16:29,113 --> 00:16:31,323
and I wouldn't have
reconnected with my love.

435
00:16:31,407 --> 00:16:33,659
True, I can't ethically ravage her body,

436
00:16:33,742 --> 00:16:37,162
I have to leave that to time,
but she's just so much fun to be with.

437
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:39,415
I, too, am in a relationship,

438
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:41,959
but mine is purely
a revenge-based deal.

439
00:16:42,334 --> 00:16:44,211
I plan on making this person
fall in love with me

440
00:16:44,294 --> 00:16:46,171
and then destroying them
by breaking their heart.

441
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:48,549
How do you make someone love you?

442
00:16:48,632 --> 00:16:50,009
Can you pass the mustard, please?

443
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:53,637
It's easy when you've got so much
in common. Last night, for instance,

444
00:16:53,721 --> 00:16:55,389
we both got a case of the munchies,

445
00:16:55,472 --> 00:16:57,599
and then we went out
and we stole these pies...

446
00:16:57,725 --> 00:17:01,145
<i>As it turns out, they did a lot</i>
<i>more than steal pies.</i>

447
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:03,731
<i>They had a raucous good time.</i>

448
00:17:05,149 --> 00:17:06,650
And then the candy
bean dish right here,

449
00:17:06,942 --> 00:17:09,528
we made those at Color Me Mine,
and I know they're kind of cockeyed,

450
00:17:09,611 --> 00:17:11,530
but they remind us both
of my crooked smile.

451
00:17:11,822 --> 00:17:14,116
I'll tell you who,
but this person is sort of a celebrity.

452
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,619
Turns out my femme fatale

453
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:19,204
is a bit of a celebrity herself.

454
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:22,750
Well, looks like life is
going pretty well for both of us.

455
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:24,126
Except that I'm broke.

456
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:25,669
And I'm a sex offender.

457
00:17:25,753 --> 00:17:28,213
Michael expects me to sell
these split-level death traps.

458
00:17:28,338 --> 00:17:29,882
And how am I
supposed to do that?

459
00:17:29,965 --> 00:17:32,009
I mean, there are no schools or libraries

460
00:17:32,092 --> 00:17:33,510
or Internet or playgrounds

461
00:17:33,594 --> 00:17:34,636
within 20 miles of here.

462
00:17:36,764 --> 00:17:39,183
It's funny, I've been looking
for a place to live,

463
00:17:39,308 --> 00:17:42,227
and that fills virtually every
parole requirement I have.

464
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:44,480
That's great.
When can you move in?

465
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:46,523
Duh! Now.

466
00:17:47,524 --> 00:17:49,526
The other sex offenders
are gonna be so jealous.

467
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:53,906
<i>And that's when Gob went from filling</i>
<i>one Sudden Valley house...</i>

468
00:17:53,989 --> 00:17:55,532
You know other people
with similar needs?

469
00:17:56,283 --> 00:17:59,578
I have a list of men that could
fill every opening you have.

470
00:17:59,953 --> 00:18:00,996
<i>...to filling them all.</i>

471
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:06,710
Let me get a shot of mustard.

472
00:18:07,544 --> 00:18:09,296
That was all cheese,
but no mustard.

473
00:18:15,886 --> 00:18:18,263
<i>Gob didn't want  to look too into it...</i>

474
00:18:18,388 --> 00:18:20,307
<i>by calling Tony right away.</i>

475
00:18:20,557 --> 00:18:22,309
[Tony] <i>It's Tony... I'm not here right now</i>

476
00:18:22,392 --> 00:18:24,686
<i>because I'm right behind you.</i>

477
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:26,939
<i>Made you look.</i>

478
00:18:27,022 --> 00:18:28,482
<i>But how did I know you looked?</i>

479
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:29,942
<i>Because I'm right behind you!</i>

480
00:18:30,025 --> 00:18:32,402
[narrator] <i>Although, he did seem</i>
<i>kind of into it.</i>

481
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:33,570
[Tony] <i>Made you look again.</i>

482
00:18:34,071 --> 00:18:35,197
Tony, it's Gob.

483
00:18:35,531 --> 00:18:37,658
Man, does anybody ever fall for that?

484
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:40,661
Listen, I was thinking about you,

485
00:18:40,869 --> 00:18:42,788
what a fun night we
had the other night.

486
00:18:42,913 --> 00:18:44,706
So just call me when you get a chance.

487
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:46,458
Okay? All right.

488
00:18:47,709 --> 00:18:48,836
[cell phone chimes]

489
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:51,588
-That was fast, you hot little... Hi.
-[Lucille] <i>It's your mother.</i>

490
00:18:51,713 --> 00:18:53,715
You better start to build this wall,
pronto.

491
00:18:54,174 --> 00:18:55,217
I tried with your father,

492
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:56,343
but he can't do it.

493
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:58,929
[narrator] <i>The wall in question</i>
<i>was to be built</i>

[Lucille] You need to make it look like
major construction has begun on the wall.

505

I'm busy now.
I'm working with Michael.

What are you working on?

00:19:32,588 --> 00:19:33,922
Dad made him give me a job.

508

I see, so he thought

509
00:19:35,674 --> 00:19:37,801
it was a good idea
to have you two together.

510
00:19:37,926 --> 00:19:39,261
Isn't that nice?

511
00:19:39,344 --> 00:19:41,763
My God, is there anyone
there with half a brain

512
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:42,973
that can help me with this?

513
00:19:43,098 --> 00:19:45,976
I don't know about half a brain,

-That would be great.
