AND THE ONE SON 
WHO HAD NO CHOICE...

4
00:00:06,005 --> 00:00:07,257
BUT TO KEEP THEM ALL TOGETHER.

5
00:00:13,513 --> 00:00:15,598
IT'S ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT.

VISITING HIS FATHER IN PRISON,

7
00:00:22,063 --> 00:00:25,066
ANXIOUS TO GET TO THE BOTTOM 
OF SOME MYSTERIOUS BOOKKEEPING.

8
00:00:25,066 --> 00:00:26,401
- IT JUST DOESN'T MAKE 
ANY SENSE, DAD.

9
00:00:26,401 --> 00:00:27,777
I MEAN, 
WHERE DID THIS MONEY COME FROM?

10
00:00:27,777 --> 00:00:29,529
AND WHY DID IT END UP IN 
THE INTERNATIONAL ACCOUNTS FILE?

11
00:00:29,529 --> 00:00:31,114
Narrator: 
GEORGE SR. WAS ALSO ANXIOUS--

12
00:00:31,114 --> 00:00:32,115

Narrator: 
BUT LESS ABOUT THE BOOKKEEPING.

14
00:00:33,116 --> 00:00:34,200

IS NEVER GONNA HAPPEN.

15
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:35,201
LOOK AT THIS.

16
00:00:35,201 --> 00:00:36,286
HALF OF THESE GUYS 
ARE STILL IN THEIR CUFFS.

17
00:00:36,286 --> 00:00:37,287
- I HATE TO BE A BUZZ KILL,

18
00:00:37,287 --> 00:00:38,746
BUT I'M TRYING TO GET YOU 
OUT OF HERE.

19
00:00:38,746 --> 00:00:39,830

20
00:00:39,830 --> 00:00:41,166
TO GET US 
OUT OF LAST PLACE, MICHAEL.

21
00:00:41,166 --> 00:00:42,833
WE'RE PLAYING RAHWAY NEXT WEEK.

WORD HAS IT THAT 
THEY'RE GETTING JOSE CANSECO.

23
00:00:45,836 --> 00:00:47,713
- I'M STARTING TO WONDER 
WHY I EVEN BOTHER COMING.

24
00:00:47,713 --> 00:00:48,714
- BLUTH! RIGHT FIELD!

25
00:00:48,714 --> 00:00:50,007
- THAT IS RIDICULOUS.

26
00:00:50,007 --> 00:00:52,385
- YOU WON'T EVEN TALK TO ME!

27
00:00:51,217 --> 00:00:53,344

Narrator: 
KITTY REALIZED HER MISTAKE.

35
00:01:06,399 --> 00:01:08,651

00:01:08,651 --> 00:01:10,403
Narrator: 
BUT NOT IMMEDIATELY.

37
00:01:10,403 --> 00:01:12,530
- OH! OH, GOD.

38
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:13,698
I'M SORRY.

39
00:01:13,698 --> 00:01:16,076
GEORGE'S WIFE. 
YOUR MOTHER.

40
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:18,661
I'M SO USED TO 
BEING GEORGE'S ASSISTANT.

41
00:01:18,661 --> 00:01:20,705
Narrator: 
KITTY HAD BEEN GEORGE SR.'s

42
00:01:19,995 --> 00:01:22,248
FIERCELY LOYAL ASSISTANT 
FOR YEARS.

43
00:01:27,212 --> 00:01:28,754
AND MICHAEL SUSPECTED

44
00:01:28,754 --> 00:01:30,840
THAT SHE HAD 
THE INFORMATION HE NEEDED.

45
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:33,008
- HEY, KITTY, LISTEN, 
YOU WOULDN'T KNOW

46
00:01:33,008 --> 00:01:35,678
IF WE HAD ANY DOCUMENTATION 
ON THESE INTERNATIONAL ACCOUNTS,

47
00:01:35,678 --> 00:01:36,679
WOULD YOU?

48
00:01:36,679 --> 00:01:40,350
- THAT'S ACTUALLY 
NOT ANY OF YOUR BUSINESS.

49
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:41,351
MY BUSINESS.

50
00:01:41,351 --> 00:01:42,977
THAT'S NOT 
ANY OF MY BUSINESS.

51
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:46,689
- HEY, MOM.

52
00:01:46,689 --> 00:01:48,483
- ARE YOU AWARE 
THAT WE'VE BEEN DOWNGRADED

53
00:01:48,483 --> 00:01:50,651
TO BEING JUST 
POOL MEMBERS AT THE CLUB NOW?

54
00:01:50,651 --> 00:01:51,986
- YEAH, IT'S A REAL SHAME

55
00:01:51,986 --> 00:01:53,113
WHAT'S GOING ON 
WITH THIS FAMILY.

56
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:54,114
YOU'RE STUCK BY THE POOL,

57
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:55,698
AND DAD'S GETTING PICKED LAST 
FOR SOFTBALL.

58
00:01:55,698 --> 00:01:56,824
- NONETHELESS, MICHAEL,

59
00:01:56,824 --> 00:01:58,534
YOU CAN FREE UP 
A LITTLE COMPANY MONEY

60
00:01:58,534 --> 00:02:00,411
TO GET BACK OUR GOLF PRIVILEGES.

61
00:02:00,411 --> 00:02:02,455
- NO, I CAN'T. 
MOM, YOU DON'T EVEN PLAY GOLF.

62
00:02:02,455 --> 00:02:04,665
- NO, BUT I USE 
THE CLUBHOUSE DINING ROOM--

63
00:02:04,665 --> 00:02:06,292
UNTIL I WAS TURNED AWAY TODAY.

64
00:02:06,292 --> 00:02:07,793
IT'S EMBARRASSING--

65
00:02:07,793 --> 00:02:08,794
TAKE IT BACK! 
[woman gasps]

66
00:02:08,794 --> 00:02:10,963
IF I WANTED SOMETHING 
YOUR THUMB TOUCHED,

67
00:02:10,963 --> 00:02:12,923
I'D EAT 
THE INSIDE OF YOUR EAR!

68
00:02:14,592 --> 00:02:16,844
YOU SHOULD SEE 
THE LOOKS I'M GETTING.

69
00:02:16,844 --> 00:02:18,221
FINE, 
IF YOU CAN'T FREE UP THE CASH,

70
00:02:18,221 --> 00:02:20,598
HAVE YOUR FATHER 
CALL THE CLUB PRESIDENT.

71
00:02:20,598 --> 00:02:21,599
- I'VE GOT NEWS FOR YOU, MOM--

72
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:24,101
I'M NOT VISITING DAD 
IN JAIL ANYMORE.

73
00:02:24,101 --> 00:02:25,102

74
00:02:25,102 --> 00:02:26,146

I REALLY HAVE.

75
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:27,480
YOU KNOW, I'M DOWN THERE 
EVERY SINGLE DAY.

76
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:30,191
I'M TRYING TO DO WHAT I CAN TO 
GET THIS COMPANY BACK ON TRACK,

77
00:02:30,191 --> 00:02:32,026
AND HE BARELY EVEN 
ACKNOWLEDGES ME.

78
00:02:32,026 --> 00:02:33,861
- THAT IS DISGUSTING!

79
00:02:33,861 --> 00:02:35,863
TALK TO YOUR FATHER.

80
00:02:35,863 --> 00:02:38,283
I WILL NOT STAND FOR THIS!

81
00:02:38,283 --> 00:02:40,243
[loud banging]

82
00:02:40,243 --> 00:02:41,244
- [groans]

83
00:02:41,244 --> 00:02:42,495

84
00:02:42,495 --> 00:02:44,038
CAN I, UH...

85
00:02:44,038 --> 00:02:45,665
GET YOU TO STOP DOING THAT?

86
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:48,000
- I'M JUST SETTING UP 
AN OFFICE.

87
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,585
GOTTA WRITE 
A STRONGLY WORDED LETTER

88
00:02:49,585 --> 00:02:52,505

HIS CAREER AS AN ESCAPE ARTIST,

90
00:02:55,466 --> 00:02:58,719
GOB HAD RECENTLY CHECKED INTO 
PRISON AS A PUBLICITY STUNT.

91
00:02:58,719 --> 00:03:00,346
- YOU REALLY THINK YOU CAN 
BREAK OUT OF MY PRISON?

92
00:03:00,346 --> 00:03:01,931
- YOU WON'T EVEN KNOW 
I WAS HERE.

93
00:03:01,931 --> 00:03:04,600
narrator: 
BUT AFTER A SHIV TO HIS SIDE,

94
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,561
GOB WAS RUSHED 
TO A LOCAL HOSPITAL,

95
00:03:06,561 --> 00:03:09,480
THUS FULFILLING, IN GOB'S MIND, 
HIS CONTRACT WITH THE PUBLIC.

96
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:10,481
- [singing] 
TA-DAH.

97
00:03:10,481 --> 00:03:12,275
narrator: 
AND YET THE WARDEN HAD REFUSED

98
00:03:12,275 --> 00:03:14,902
TO ACKNOWLEDGE 
THE LEGITIMACY OF THE ESCAPE.

99
00:03:14,902 --> 00:03:18,239
- SO I AM GOING AFTER THIS GUY 
WITH EVERYTHING I'VE GOT...

100
00:03:19,156 --> 00:03:20,533
ART.

101
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:23,411
NOW WE ARE WRITING 
A LETTER.

102
00:03:23,411 --> 00:03:24,662
- GOB?

103
00:03:26,163 --> 00:03:28,249
WELL, I WISH I WOULD'VE KNOWN 
YOU WERE COMING.

104
00:03:28,249 --> 00:03:30,209
I AM A MESS.

105
00:03:30,209 --> 00:03:32,086
- DON'T KNOW IF A CALL FROM ME 
WOULD'VE CHANGED THAT.

106
00:03:32,086 --> 00:03:33,128
- [snickers]

107
00:03:33,128 --> 00:03:34,797
DO YOU LIKE MY OUTFIT?

108
00:03:34,797 --> 00:03:37,342
- NOT AS MUCH AS 
I LIKE WHAT'S UNDERNEATH IT.

109
00:03:37,342 --> 00:03:39,552
- GOB!

110
00:03:39,552 --> 00:03:40,595

111
00:03:40,595 --> 00:03:42,430
GET UP. 
I'VE GOT A LETTER TO WRITE.

112
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:45,057
- WHOO! 
YOU'RE ALL BUSINESS.

113
00:03:45,057 --> 00:03:46,642
JUST LIKE YOUR DAD.

114
00:03:47,768 --> 00:03:50,020

narrator: 
MICHAEL REALIZED

116
00:03:51,356 --> 00:03:53,566
THAT KITTY'S 
OBVIOUS ATTRACTION TO GOB

117
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:55,485
COULD PERHAPS BE 
OF USE TO HIM.

118
00:03:55,485 --> 00:03:57,194
- GOB, HOW WOULD YOU LIKE 
A TOUCH LAMP?

119
00:03:58,613 --> 00:03:59,739

WHO NEEDS THERAPY!

122
00:04:03,868 --> 00:04:06,371
- YES, TOBIAS, 
I WANT THE MARRIAGE TO WORK.

123
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:08,248
I JUST DON'T KNOW 
IF THERAPY IS THE ANSWER.

124
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:10,625
- OH, RIGHT, BECAUSE YOU 
DIDN'T RESPECT MY OLD CAREER,

125
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:12,502
AND YOU CERTAINLY 
DON'T RESPECT MY NEW ONE!

126
00:04:12,502 --> 00:04:13,711
- YOU DON'T HAVE 
A NEW ONE!

127
00:04:13,711 --> 00:04:15,129
Narrator: 
THINGS HAD BEEN TENSE

128
00:04:15,129 --> 00:04:17,423

00:04:17,423 --> 00:04:18,674
TO PURSUE AN ACTING CAREER.

130
00:04:21,636 --> 00:04:22,887

131
00:04:22,887 --> 00:04:24,597
- AND HOW AM I NOT 
ADDRESSING YOUR NEEDS?

132
00:04:24,597 --> 00:04:26,140
- HOW CAN YOU EVEN ASK THAT?

133
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:27,141
WHAT IS THIS?

134
00:04:27,141 --> 00:04:28,893
- OH! GO RIGHT TO THAT!

135
00:04:28,893 --> 00:04:30,060
GOOD. GO RIGHT THERE.

136
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:32,062
REAL MATURE. REALLY GREAT.

137
00:04:32,062 --> 00:04:33,648
OKAY, KIDS...

138
00:04:33,648 --> 00:04:35,775
MOMMY AND DADDY 
ARE GOING OUT FOR ICE CREAM.

139

IT'S NOT FOR KIDS.

144
00:04:46,661 --> 00:04:47,745
WHAT?

145
00:04:49,914 --> 00:04:52,166
- OKAY, SO, 
WHY ARE WE DOING THIS?

146
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:53,584
- 'CAUSE IT'S OBVIOUS 
THEY'RE LYING.

147
00:04:53,584 --> 00:04:55,295
COME ON, DRIVE!

148

00:04:56,962 --> 00:04:58,381
- HOW ARE THEY GONNA SEE US?

150
00:04:58,381 --> 00:05:00,841
- WELL, IT SAYS "BLUTH COMPANY" 
RIGHT ON THE SIDE.

151
00:05:00,841 --> 00:05:04,261
PLUS, IT'S A STAIRWAY. 
THAT'S GONNA CATCH THE EYE.

Narrator: 
THE AIRPORT STAIRWAY VEHICLE

153
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:10,100
WAS THE LAST VESTIGE 
OF THE BLUTHS' FORMER WEALTH.

154
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:13,270
ALSO, THAT HOUSE OF PIES 
WENT OUT OF BUSINESS.

155
00:05:14,271 --> 00:05:16,023
- YOU ARE SCARED. 
I KNEW IT.

156
00:05:16,023 --> 00:05:17,191
NO, I'M NOT SCARED.

157
00:05:17,191 --> 00:05:19,902
IT'S JUST THAT... 
I HAVE PLANS LATER.

158
00:05:19,902 --> 00:05:22,322
I-I'M VISITING POP-POP.

WHAT YOU SHOULD DO?

170
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:41,382
YOU SHOULD GO GET 
YOUR MOM'S DATE BOOK.

171
00:05:41,382 --> 00:05:42,383

172
00:05:42,383 --> 00:05:43,551
SHE MUST HAVE WRITTEN DOWN 
WHERE THEY'RE GOING.

173
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:45,595
OH, HEY, I STILL WANNA 
HEAR ABOUT PRISON, OKAY?

174
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:47,179
- WELL, IF YOU CAN HANDLE IT.

175
00:05:47,179 --> 00:05:48,431
[door closes]

176
00:05:49,932 --> 00:05:52,017
Narrator: MICHAEL ARRIVED HOME 
IN A GOOD MOOD.

177
00:05:52,017 --> 00:05:54,353
WITH GOB GETTING 
THE INFORMATION FROM KITTY,

178
00:05:54,353 --> 00:05:56,105
HE WOULD NO LONGER 
HAVE TO VISIT PRISON

179
00:05:56,105 --> 00:05:57,356
AND DEAL WITH HIS FATHER.

180
00:05:57,356 --> 00:06:00,192
- HEY, BUDDY! 
CAME HOME EARLY.

181
00:06:00,192 --> 00:06:01,193
WANNA DO SOMETHIN'?

182
00:06:01,193 --> 00:06:02,737
ANYTHING. ANYTHING AT ALL.

183
00:06:03,738 --> 00:06:05,740
- I WANNA VISIT POP-POP 
IN PRISON.

184
00:06:08,242 --> 00:06:09,368
Narrator: 
BACK AT THE OFFICE,

185
00:06:09,368 --> 00:06:11,912
GOB WAS MAKING PROGRESS 
WITH MICHAEL'S ASSISTANT.

186
00:06:11,912 --> 00:06:15,416
- HERE'S WHERE WE KEEP 
ALL OF OUR...

187
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:16,959
HEAVYWEIGHT PAPER.

188
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:19,920
- BET YOU CAN SHOW ME 
WHERE A LOT OF THINGS ARE.

189
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:23,799
- WHAT KIND OF THINGS 
ARE YOU...

190
00:06:23,799 --> 00:06:24,842
LOOKING FOR?

191
00:06:24,842 --> 00:06:28,053
- WHAT, UH-- 
WHAT ARE YOU HIDING?

192
00:06:28,053 --> 00:06:30,681
- NOTHING YOU CAN'T FIND.

193
00:06:30,681 --> 00:06:32,975
- WAIT A SECOND. 
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

194
00:06:32,975 --> 00:06:34,268
TAKE OFF YOUR GLASSES.

195
00:06:36,311 --> 00:06:37,688
OH.

196
00:06:37,688 --> 00:06:39,899
WAIT, WAIT.

197
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:41,692
LET DOWN YOUR HAIR.

198
00:06:43,486 --> 00:06:46,113
[man singing] 
YEAH, BABY

199
00:06:46,113 --> 00:06:48,073
NO. GLASSES ON. 
HAIR BACK UP.

200
00:06:48,073 --> 00:06:49,408
LET'S JUST GET THAT HAIR 
RIGHT BACK UP.

201
00:06:49,408 --> 00:06:50,701
- DO YOU WANT ME TO 
TURN ALL THE LIGHTS OFF?

202
00:06:50,701 --> 00:06:52,703
WHAT ABOUT THAT? 
- YES, YES, PLEASE.

203
00:06:52,703 --> 00:06:54,789
- HOW'S THAT? 
IS THAT BETTER?

204
00:06:54,789 --> 00:06:56,081
- IT JUST SEEMS 
LIKE THERE'S STILL LIGHT

205
00:06:56,081 --> 00:06:57,750
COMING IN 
FROM UNDER THE DOOR.

206
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,251
Narrator: 
AND LINDSAY AND TOBIAS WERE,

207
00:06:59,251 --> 00:07:00,252
FOR THE FIRST TIME,

208
00:07:00,252 --> 00:07:01,587
ADDRESSING 
THEIR MARITAL PROBLEMS.

209
00:07:01,587 --> 00:07:03,839
- IT'S LIKE WE'RE 
FACE TO FACE NOW,

210
00:07:03,839 --> 00:07:07,259
LIKE WE'RE REALLY 
SEEING THIS MARRIAGE AND...

211
00:07:07,259 --> 00:07:09,428
I'M AFRAID IT'S A LIE.

212
00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:14,183
[slow, deliberate applause]

213
00:07:14,183 --> 00:07:15,309
- BRAVO.

214
00:07:15,309 --> 00:07:17,102
SEE, IF I GAVE A PERFORMANCE 
THAT GOOD,

215
00:07:17,102 --> 00:07:18,896
I'D HAVE MY OWN 
"ALIAS" TYPE SHOW.

216
00:07:18,896 --> 00:07:19,897
- STOP IT.

217
00:07:19,897 --> 00:07:22,942
I AM SO SICK OF HEARING 
ABOUT ACTING, ACTING, ACTING!

218
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:26,361
- OKAY, OKAY, LOOK. 
MAYBE WE NEED A NEW APPROACH.

219
00:07:26,361 --> 00:07:30,157
UM...LET'S TRY 
SOME ROLE PLAYING.

220
00:07:30,157 --> 00:07:31,826
- YES! ALL RIGHT.

221
00:07:33,410 --> 00:07:34,829
- [sighs]

222
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:36,747
Narrator: MICHAEL HEADED BACK 
TO THE PRISON,

223
00:07:36,747 --> 00:07:39,249
DESPITE HIS EARLIER VOW 
NEVER TO RETURN.

224
00:07:39,249 --> 00:07:40,585
- WELL, YOU ALWAYS SAY 
FAMILY FIRST.

225
00:07:40,585 --> 00:07:42,086
I SHOULD SEE MY GRANDPA, RIGHT?

226
00:07:42,086 --> 00:07:43,253
- NOW, LISTEN. 
I'M NOT STOPPING YOU,

227
00:07:43,253 --> 00:07:45,255
BUT JUST, AFTER THIS 
I'M NOT GOING BACK OUT THERE.

228
00:07:45,255 --> 00:07:47,424
- WHY? 
IS IT SCARY?

229
00:07:47,424 --> 00:07:49,510
- SCARY? NO. 
NO.

230
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:52,472
IT'S THE OPPOSITE OF SCARY. 
IT'S LIKE A CARNIVAL.

231
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:55,182
WITHOUT THE HALF-PERSON 
ON THE SKATEBOARD

232
00:07:55,182 --> 00:07:57,059
THAT GRABBED YOUR KNEE 
TO STEADY HIMSELF.

233
00:07:57,059 --> 00:07:58,769
IT'S LIKE A COUNTRY CLUB.

234
00:07:58,769 --> 00:08:00,270
ALL THE GUY DOES 
IS EAT ICE CREAM

235
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:02,523
AND PLAY SOFTBALL ALL DAY.

236
00:08:02,523 --> 00:08:03,524
Narrator: IN FACT,

237
00:08:03,524 --> 00:08:06,736
GEORGE SR.'s SOFTBALL GAME 
HAD TAKEN MOST OF THE DAY.

238
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:08,153
IT WAS THE 14th INNING,

239
00:08:08,153 --> 00:08:09,822
AND TENSIONS 
WERE RUNNING A LITTLE HIGH.

240
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:10,865
- I'LL GIVE YOU 
A THOUSAND BUCKS,

241
00:08:10,865 --> 00:08:12,074
YOU CALL THE NEXT ONE A STRIKE.

242
00:08:12,074 --> 00:08:14,368
MY KNEES ARE KILLING ME.

243
00:08:15,077 --> 00:08:17,246
NO BATTER! 
NO BATTER HERE!

244
00:08:17,246 --> 00:08:18,247
NO BATTER.

245
00:08:18,247 --> 00:08:19,999
- STRIKE THREE!

246
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:22,209
- STRIKE THREE, MY ASS!

247
00:08:22,209 --> 00:08:23,628
[bat pounds umpire] 
- OHH!

248
00:08:23,628 --> 00:08:25,671
- DOWN IN THE YARD! GET DOWN! 
- [gunshots]

249
00:08:26,463 --> 00:08:28,966
- NO BATTER. 
NO--NO BATTER.

250
00:08:28,966 --> 00:08:31,051
NO--SHH.

251
00:08:31,969 --> 00:08:33,554
- OKAY, THERE HE IS.

252
00:08:33,554 --> 00:08:35,180
NOW GO ON IN THERE 
AND SURPRISE HIM.

253
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:37,600
I'M GONNA GET US 
A FEW ICE CREAM SANDWICHES.

254
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:41,186
GO ON. GO ON.

255
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:43,773
- HEY, POP-POP.

256
00:08:45,357 --> 00:08:47,401
HOW'S PRISON?

257
00:08:47,401 --> 00:08:48,736
- I'M GONNA DIE IN HERE.

258
00:08:49,236 --> 00:08:50,445
- WHAT?

259
00:08:50,445 --> 00:08:52,281
- THEY'RE GONNA KILL GRANDPA.

260
00:08:52,281 --> 00:08:53,448
AH, I GOTTA--

261
00:08:53,448 --> 00:08:56,368
I GOTTA GET OUTTA HERE. 
I'M AN INNOCENT MAN.

262
00:08:56,368 --> 00:08:58,495
YOU GOTTA HELP POP-POP 
GET OUTTA HERE.

263
00:08:58,495 --> 00:08:59,997
GIVE ME YOUR HAIR. 
- MY HAIR?

264
00:08:59,997 --> 00:09:00,998
- GIVE ME YOUR HAIR! 
GIVE POP-POP YOUR HAIR!

265
00:09:00,998 --> 00:09:03,959
- NO TOUCHING! 
NO TOUCHING! NO TOUCHING!

266
00:09:03,959 --> 00:09:05,002
- GIVE ME THE HAIR!

267
00:09:05,002 --> 00:09:06,211
- ONE OF THESE GOT SMOOSHED,

268
00:09:06,211 --> 00:09:09,464
BUT DON'T LET THAT 
RUIN PRISON FOR YOU.

269
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:11,383
- NO BATTER. 
[chuckles]

270
00:09:11,383 --> 00:09:13,427
NO BATTER. NO BATTER.

271
00:09:18,057 --> 00:09:19,892
- COME ON, BABY! 
THROW THE BALL!

272
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:22,519
- I'M SURE YOUR GRANDFATHER 
WAS JUST KIDDING AROUND.

273
00:09:22,519 --> 00:09:23,604
YOU KNOW THAT'S 
HIS SENSE OF HUMOR.

274
00:09:23,604 --> 00:09:25,480
- I KNOW, I KNOW. 
YEAH.

275
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:26,523
I DON'T--

276
00:09:26,523 --> 00:09:27,692
I DON'T TOTALLY GET 
THE HAIR JOKE,

277
00:09:27,692 --> 00:09:29,401
BUT I'M FINE, DAD.

278
00:09:29,401 --> 00:09:30,444
- ARE YOU SURE?

279
00:09:31,445 --> 00:09:33,488
I AM GONNA HEAD BACK IN, 
THOUGH, OKAY?

280
00:09:33,488 --> 00:09:35,741
I'M GONNA SEE IF POP-POP'S 
GOT ANY MORE ZINGERS.

281
00:09:35,741 --> 00:09:36,742
- [laughs]

282
00:09:36,742 --> 00:09:38,578
- WHY DON'T YOU JUST STAY OUT 
HERE AND RELAX, PAL, OKAY?

283
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:39,995
WATCH THE SOFTBALL GAME. 
- OKAY.

284
00:09:39,995 --> 00:09:41,538
- I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

285
00:09:47,252 --> 00:09:49,714
[alarm buzzer buzzes] 
- HEY, STOP! STOP!

286
00:09:49,714 --> 00:09:54,509
- [footsteps pounding] 
- [gunshots]

287
00:09:55,510 --> 00:09:56,596
- DAD?

288
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:58,973
- JUST DON'T 
LIKE PRISON ANYMORE.

289
00:09:58,973 --> 00:10:00,933
- WELL, THAT'S WHY I'M TRYING 
TO GET YOU OUT OF HERE.

290
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:02,476
- I DON'T KNOW, 
MAYBE I'VE BEEN IN DENIAL,

291
00:10:02,476 --> 00:10:05,020
BUT THIS PLACE 
IS BREAKING ME, MIKEY,

292
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:06,856
AND I'M ALONE HERE, 
BUT FOR YOU.

293
00:10:06,856 --> 00:10:08,816
- COME ON. 
YOU GOT ME, YOU GOT MOM.

294
00:10:08,816 --> 00:10:10,067
- [chuckles]

295
00:10:10,067 --> 00:10:12,820
YOUR MOTHER'S NEVER 
SHOWN HER FACE.

296
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:14,614
- WHOA. 
SHE'S NEVER BEEN HERE?

297
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:15,740
YOU SHOULD'VE HEARD 
THE GRIEF SHE GAVE ME

298
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:17,324
WHEN I SAID 
I'D NEVER SHOW UP AGAIN.

299
00:10:17,324 --> 00:10:19,076
- YOU SAID--YOU SAID WHAT? 
[cuffs clang on bars]

300
00:10:19,076 --> 00:10:21,621
- DAD, COME ON, 
YOU DON'T NEED ME.

301
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:22,955
YOU'RE PLAYING SOFTBALL 
ALL THE TIME.

302
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:25,666
- I DO NEED YOU, MICHAEL!

303
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:27,668
NO MORE SOFTBALL. 
- THIS IS NUTS, YOU KNOW.

304
00:10:27,668 --> 00:10:28,753
I MEAN, YOU'RE HER HUSBAND.

305
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:30,587
THE LEAST SHE COULD DO IS 
COME OUT AND VISIT YOU, RIGHT?

306
00:10:30,587 --> 00:10:32,047
- GOD, YOU KNOW YOUR MOM.

307
00:10:32,047 --> 00:10:34,466
THIS ISN'T HER CROWD. 
SHE'S VERY EASILY THREATENED.

308
00:10:34,466 --> 00:10:36,468
YOU REMEMBER THE CARJACKER?

309
00:10:40,305 --> 00:10:41,556
[aerosol hissing] 
- AAAH!

310
00:10:41,724 --> 00:10:43,517
- WELL, SHE'S CERTAINLY 
TOUGHENED UP SINCE THEN.

311
00:10:43,517 --> 00:10:45,102
YOU KNOW, SHE'S EATING LUNCH 
BY THE POOL NOW.

312
00:10:45,102 --> 00:10:46,103
- WELL, THERE'S A BIG DIFFERENCE

313
00:10:46,103 --> 00:10:48,355
BETWEEN THE COUNTRY CLUB POOL 
AND THE CONJUGAL TRAILER.

314
00:10:48,355 --> 00:10:49,940
- THAT'S NOT WHAT I MEANT 
WHEN I SAID "VISIT."

315
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:50,941
- YOU KNOW, IT'S TOO BAD,

316
00:10:50,941 --> 00:10:53,152
BECAUSE I REALLY MISS 
THAT PERSONAL CONTACT.

317
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:55,529
IT WAS THE ONE THING THAT 
CALMED ME WHEN I GOT STRESSED.

318
00:10:55,529 --> 00:10:59,659
IT JUST FELT...HUMANIZING.

319
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:01,285
Narrator: 
MICHAEL, FOR THE FIRST TIME,

320
00:11:01,285 --> 00:11:04,121
SAW HIS FATHER 
AS A VULNERABLE HUMAN BEING.

321
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:08,625
- [whimpers] 
DADDY HORNY, MICHAEL.

322
00:11:11,378 --> 00:11:14,089
I JUST HAVEN'T HAD SEX 
IN A MONTH.

323
00:11:14,089 --> 00:11:17,384
- YOU KNOW, YOU'VE BEEN HERE 
TWO MONTHS.

324
00:11:17,384 --> 00:11:19,553
- IT'S HARD TO GAUGE TIME. 
- YEAH, I'LL BET.

325
00:11:19,553 --> 00:11:20,595
- [clears throat]

326
00:11:20,595 --> 00:11:21,680
[door closes]

327
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,724
- HEY, MOM. 
I WENT TO VISIT DAD TODAY.

328
00:11:23,724 --> 00:11:24,725
QUICK QUESTION.

329
00:11:24,725 --> 00:11:26,476
HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE YOU 
TO GET OUT THERE?

330
00:11:26,476 --> 00:11:27,477
- OH, I'VE NEVER BEEN.

331
00:11:27,477 --> 00:11:30,480
- THEN WHY DOES HE TELL ME 
THAT YOU'VE NEVER BEEN?

332
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,691
- [belches] 
OOH. SORRY, MICHAEL.

333
00:11:32,691 --> 00:11:33,692
POOL FOOD.

334
00:11:33,692 --> 00:11:35,861
MY SYSTEM'S 
NOT USED TO CURLY FRIES.

335
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:38,781
- HOW CAN YOU 
IGNORE THAT MAN?

336
00:11:38,781 --> 00:11:40,783
YOU KNOW, HE'S HAVING 
A HARD TIME IN THERE.

337
00:11:40,783 --> 00:11:41,909
HE'S LONELY.

338
00:11:41,909 --> 00:11:43,493
- THAT'S WHAT 
HIS CHILDREN ARE FOR.

339
00:11:43,493 --> 00:11:46,705
- YEAH, WELL, YOU KNOW...

340
00:11:46,705 --> 00:11:48,999
THERE ARE 
CERTAIN THINGS THAT

341
00:11:48,999 --> 00:11:50,751
HE CAN'T GET 
FROM HIS CHILDREN.

342
00:11:50,751 --> 00:11:53,003
- IF YOU'RE GOING TO SAY 
"PRIDE," MICHAEL, YOU'RE WRONG.

343
00:11:53,003 --> 00:11:54,880
HE IS PROUD OF HIS CHILDREN.

344
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,132
- WASN'T GONNA SAY PRIDE, 
MOM.

345
00:11:57,132 --> 00:12:01,053
UH, LISTEN, 
I-I-I THINK THAT, UM--

346
00:12:01,053 --> 00:12:03,388
I THINK THAT YOU SHOULD--

347
00:12:03,388 --> 00:12:05,307
OH, I CAN'T BELIEVE 
I'M GONNA SAY THIS.

348
00:12:05,307 --> 00:12:07,726
I THINK THAT YOU SHOULD...

349
00:12:07,726 --> 00:12:09,269
VISIT HIM...

350
00:12:09,269 --> 00:12:13,107
IN AN...INTIMATE,

351
00:12:13,107 --> 00:12:16,944
MARITAL...TRAILER.

352
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:20,614
- ARE YOU MAD?

353
00:12:20,614 --> 00:12:23,242
- YOU THINK I'M COMFORTABLE 
ASKING YOU TO DO THIS?

354
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:25,953
I MEAN, HE NEEDS YOU, MOM.

355
00:12:25,953 --> 00:12:28,580
- DID HE SAY THAT?

356
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:30,249
DID HE SAY 
THAT HE MISSES ME?

357
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:32,542
DOES HE NEED 
HIS WIFE'S EMBRACE?

358
00:12:32,542 --> 00:12:34,544
- [whimpers] 
DADDY HORNY, MICHAEL.

359
00:12:34,544 --> 00:12:37,547
- HE SAID 
SOME WONDERFUL THINGS.

360
00:12:37,547 --> 00:12:40,134
- YOU REALLY WANT THIS FOR HIM, 
DON'T YOU?

361
00:12:40,134 --> 00:12:41,676
- I DO.

362
00:12:41,676 --> 00:12:44,596
- "GOLF MEMBERSHIP" 
WANT IT?

363
00:12:45,514 --> 00:12:47,224
Narrator: 
MEANWHILE, LINDSAY AND TOBIAS

364
00:12:47,224 --> 00:12:49,434
WERE GETTING TO THE HEART 
OF EACH OTHER'S VULNERABILITIES

365
00:12:49,434 --> 00:12:51,603
WITH A ROLE-REVERSAL EXERCISE.

366
00:12:51,603 --> 00:12:53,147
- BECAUSE I'M A WOMAN! 
- GOOD.

367
00:12:53,147 --> 00:12:55,065
- WITH A WOMAN'S NEEDS. 
- LOUDER.

368
00:12:55,065 --> 00:12:58,402
- AND A WOMAN'S URGES! 
AND THESE, TOBIAS.

369
00:12:58,402 --> 00:13:00,529
WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME 
YOU LOOKED AT THESE?

370
00:13:01,989 --> 00:13:03,698
- YEAH, OKAY. 
HOW LONG IS THIS SESSION?

371
00:13:03,698 --> 00:13:04,783
- OKAY, WELL, SEE, I DON'T KNOW 
WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE.

372
00:13:04,783 --> 00:13:05,784
SHE'S BREAKING IN AND OUT 
OF CHARACTER

373
00:13:05,784 --> 00:13:06,785
AND MAKING IT DIFFICULT--

374
00:13:06,785 --> 00:13:08,620
- 'CAUSE I DON'T WANNA 
BE IN A CHARACTER.

375
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:10,497
- OKAY, LET ME STOP YOU GUYS. 
ALL RIGHT?

376
00:13:10,497 --> 00:13:12,582
PLEASE. LET ME GET IN HERE.

377
00:13:12,582 --> 00:13:15,085
- THANK YOU. 
[mutters] GOD.

378
00:13:15,085 --> 00:13:17,004
- [clears throat]

379
00:13:17,004 --> 00:13:18,923
- YOU'VE NEVER BEEN 
A REAL WIFE TO ME, LINDSAY.

380
00:13:18,923 --> 00:13:21,466
- THAT'S NOT TRUE! 
AND YOU KNOW IT!

381
00:13:21,466 --> 00:13:22,843
- A MAN IS LOOKING BACK AT YOU.

382
00:13:22,843 --> 00:13:25,804
A MAN WITH DREAMS 
AND ASPIRATIONS!

383
00:13:25,804 --> 00:13:27,472
Narrator: MEANWHILE, 
MAEBY FOUND AN ADDRESS

384
00:13:27,472 --> 00:13:28,807
IN HER 
MOTHER'S APPOINTMENT BOOK...

385
00:13:28,807 --> 00:13:29,808
AND WAS GETTING CLOSER

386
00:13:29,808 --> 00:13:32,644
TO LEARNING WHAT HER PARENTS 
WERE UP TO.

387
00:13:32,644 --> 00:13:34,229
- RIGHT!

388
00:13:34,229 --> 00:13:37,566
IF I'M NO SCHWIMMER, 
YOU'RE NO JENNIFER ANISTON!

389
00:13:37,566 --> 00:13:41,946
- [sobbing] MAYBE I'M NOT EVEN 
LISA KUDROW.

390
00:13:41,946 --> 00:13:44,656
- I-I HAVE DREAMS, LINDSAY.

391
00:13:44,656 --> 00:13:47,910
DREAMS, LINDSAY.

392
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:49,828
- WELL, THEN, TOBIAS...

393
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:56,835
FOLLOW THOSE DREAMS.

394
00:13:56,835 --> 00:13:58,378
MAKE THOSE DREAMS HAPPEN.

395
00:13:58,378 --> 00:14:01,840
- YES. I WILL.

396
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:04,176
- AND SCENE!

397
00:14:04,176 --> 00:14:05,844
- [sighs]

398
00:14:05,844 --> 00:14:08,013
WOW! 
- OKAY.

399
00:14:08,013 --> 00:14:09,848
I'M SORRY 
I STEPPED ON YOUR LINE.

400
00:14:09,848 --> 00:14:10,849
- NO, NOT AT ALL.

401
00:14:10,849 --> 00:14:11,850
UH, LINDSAY, I MEAN,

402
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:13,143
DID THAT ANSWER 
SOME QUESTIONS FOR YOU?

403
00:14:13,143 --> 00:14:14,853
- YEAH, YEAH, 
I THINK IT DID, YEAH

404
00:14:14,853 --> 00:14:17,689
NOW THERE ARE TWO MEN 
I WANNA LEAVE.

405
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:20,067
Narrator: 
MICHAEL ARRIVED HOME,

406
00:14:20,067 --> 00:14:22,444
HAPPY TO HAVE A BROTHER 
TO SHARE HIS RECENT BURDEN WITH.

407
00:14:22,444 --> 00:14:23,445
- GREAT NEWS.

408
00:14:23,445 --> 00:14:25,072
- OH, GOOD. 
I COULD USE IT, BUDDY.

409
00:14:25,072 --> 00:14:28,951
I JUST CAME FROM CONVINCING MOM 
TO HAVE SEX WITH DAD.

410
00:14:28,951 --> 00:14:32,162
- GOD! WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU? 
THAT IS DISGUSTING!

411
00:14:32,162 --> 00:14:33,455
- WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?

412
00:14:33,455 --> 00:14:34,456
- OH, I'M SORRY.

413
00:14:34,456 --> 00:14:38,502
BUT JUST THE THOUGHT 
OF MOM AND DAD TOGETHER--

414
00:14:38,502 --> 00:14:40,504
I HAVE A SENSE OF PROPRIETY. 
ALL RIGHT?

415
00:14:40,504 --> 00:14:42,214
- FINE. 
WHAT'S YOUR GREAT NEWS?

416
00:14:42,214 --> 00:14:44,216
- I [bleep] KITTY.

417
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:48,012
- OH, GOB, I JUST WANTED YOU 
TO GET THE INFORMATION.

418
00:14:48,012 --> 00:14:50,680
- OH, I GOT THE INFORMATION.

419
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:51,681
- YOU DID, HUH?

420
00:14:51,681 --> 00:14:53,683
ABOUT 
THE INTERNATIONAL ACCOUNTS?

421
00:14:55,435 --> 00:14:56,561
- OH, I SEE WHAT 
YOU'RE GETTING AT.

422
00:14:56,561 --> 00:14:58,355
NO, I DIDN'T GET 
ANY INFORMATION.

423
00:14:58,355 --> 00:15:00,149
- THAT'S GREAT. 
GOOD, GOOD, GOOD, GOB.

424
00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:01,525
WELL, YOU JUST 
LOST THE TOUCH LAMP.

425
00:15:01,525 --> 00:15:02,859
- WHAT? NO! 
- YEAH, THE DEAL'S OFF!

426
00:15:02,859 --> 00:15:04,111
FORGET IT.

427
00:15:04,111 --> 00:15:05,112
I'M GONNA USE THE TOUCH LAMP 
TO SET THE MOOD

428
00:15:05,112 --> 00:15:06,906
IN THE CONJUGAL 
TRAILER WHEN DAD'S NAILING MOM!

429
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:09,283
- NO! DON'T-- 
MICHAEL!

430
00:15:09,283 --> 00:15:10,910
YOU ARE FILTHY!

431
00:15:13,245 --> 00:15:15,122
Narrator: 
THE TWO COUSINS REUNITED,

432
00:15:15,122 --> 00:15:16,165
EACH A LITTLE SHAKEN

433
00:15:16,165 --> 00:15:18,292
BY WHAT THEY HAD PRETENDED 
TO BE FEARLESS ABOUT.

434
00:15:18,292 --> 00:15:19,459
- SO YOU THINK 
THEY'LL GET DIVORCED?

435
00:15:19,459 --> 00:15:21,253
- I DON'T CARE, AND I'M NOT 
SAYING "I DON'T CARE"

436
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:22,922
LIKE KIDS WHO SAY THEY DON'T 
CARE WHEN THEY REALLY DO CARE,

437
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:23,923
'CAUSE I REALLY DON'T CARE.

438
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:27,217
- RIGHT. I KNOW. 
WHO CARES, RIGHT?

439
00:15:27,217 --> 00:15:30,262
- I MEAN, I CARE. 
-  HOW COULD YOU NOT?

440
00:15:30,262 --> 00:15:32,472
- YOU KNOW, OUR FAMILY'S 
REALLY MESSED UP.

441
00:15:32,472 --> 00:15:34,724
- I KNOW. 
WE'RE LIKE THE ONLY NORMAL ONES.

442
00:15:34,724 --> 00:15:37,644
- AT LEAST WE GOT 
EACH OTHER. RIGHT?

443
00:15:46,653 --> 00:15:48,197
- GEORGE MICHAEL?

444
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:49,323
- SORRY. 
[chuckles]

445
00:15:49,323 --> 00:15:50,824
SOMETIMES I JUST DON'T KNOW 
IF IT'S GONNA BE

446
00:15:50,824 --> 00:15:54,119
A LONG HUG OR A SHORT HUG 
OR, LIKE, A MIDDLE-MEDIUM HUG.

447
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:55,495
IT'S HARD TO TELL 
SOMETIMES.

448
00:15:55,495 --> 00:15:57,081
YEAH, BUT, THAT WAS A GOOD HUG. 
THAT'S PLENTY FOR NOW.

449
00:15:57,081 --> 00:15:58,082
I DON'T CARE.

450
00:15:58,082 --> 00:16:01,168
HUG'S GOTTA END SOMETIME, 
OBVIOUSLY.

451
00:16:01,168 --> 00:16:04,004
Narrator: SOON, MICHAEL 
WAS DRIVING LUCILLE TO PRISON,

452
00:16:04,004 --> 00:16:06,756
AND SHE SEEMED TO BE 
LOOKING FORWARD TO IT.

453
00:16:06,756 --> 00:16:08,800
- WHERE ARE WE GOING AFTER?

454
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:15,015
- HEY, DAD. 
- MICHAEL!

455
00:16:15,015 --> 00:16:16,766
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

456
00:16:16,766 --> 00:16:18,018
- YOU NEEDED MY HELP,

457
00:16:18,018 --> 00:16:19,603
AND I KNOW IT WAS HARD 
FOR YOU TO ASK,

458
00:16:19,603 --> 00:16:20,980
SO I TOOK IT UPON MYSELF 
TO BRING HER.

459
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,647
- THAT DOESN'T MAKE YOU 
UNCOMFORTABLE?

460
00:16:22,647 --> 00:16:24,566
- WELL, YEAH, THE DRIVE 
WAS A LITTLE AWKWARD.

461
00:16:24,566 --> 00:16:28,320
- NOT EVERY SON WOULD DO THIS 
FOR HIS FATHER.

462
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,779
THANK YOU FOR THIS.

463
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,746
- HELLO, GEORGE.

464
00:16:37,746 --> 00:16:39,164
- WHAT THE HELL'S 
YOUR MOTHER DOING IN HERE?

465
00:16:39,164 --> 00:16:42,292
- WHO WERE YOU EXPECTING? 
- OH, I'VE DONE A BAD THING.

466
00:16:42,292 --> 00:16:44,461
I'VE DONE 
A TERRIBLE THING.

467
00:16:44,461 --> 00:16:45,629
- THERE'S SOMEONE ELSE 
IN THAT TRAILER, ISN'T THERE?

468
00:16:45,629 --> 00:16:47,047
- I'VE DONE A REPULSIVE THING.

469
00:16:47,047 --> 00:16:49,799
- WAIT--WHOA. 
IT'S KITTY?

470
00:16:49,799 --> 00:16:51,510
- SHH! 
- HOW LONG?

471
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:53,053
WHEN DID THIS START? 
- OH, COME ON! COME ON!

472
00:16:53,053 --> 00:16:54,096
- THIS IS THE FIRST TIME.

473
00:16:57,641 --> 00:16:58,642
EVERY FRIDAY 
FOR THE LAST EIGHT YEARS.

474
00:16:58,642 --> 00:17:00,227
- [sighs] 
- MICHAEL, DADDY--

475
00:17:00,227 --> 00:17:01,395
- HORNY. I GOT THAT.

476
00:17:01,395 --> 00:17:02,604
- OH, COME ON. 
HEY, WAIT A MINUTE.

477
00:17:02,604 --> 00:17:04,148
THIS IS EASY. 
THIS IS AN EASY ONE.

478
00:17:04,148 --> 00:17:07,942
NOW, I'LL GO IN THERE 
WITH KITTY, I'LL DO MY THING,

479
00:17:07,942 --> 00:17:10,529
AND TH-TH-THEN 
I'LL GO AND SEE YOUR MOTH--

480
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:11,613
THIS IS A HARD ONE.

481
00:17:11,613 --> 00:17:13,698
- SHE'S YOUR SECRETARY. 
- SEE, YOU'RE RIGHT.

482
00:17:13,698 --> 00:17:15,409
FAMILY FIRST.

483
00:17:15,409 --> 00:17:18,162
TAKE CARE OF KITTY. 
MICHAEL.

484
00:17:18,162 --> 00:17:20,789
I NEED YOU NOW.

485
00:17:20,789 --> 00:17:23,250
- "INTERNATIONAL ACCOUNTS" 
NEED ME?

486
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:25,294
Narrator: 
AND SO AN AGREEMENT WAS MADE.

487
00:17:25,294 --> 00:17:27,296
GEORGE SR. 
WOULD REVEAL THE TRUTH,

488
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:28,588
AND MICHAEL WOULD MAKE SURE

489
00:17:28,588 --> 00:17:30,215
KITTY DIDN'T COME OUT 
OF THE TRAILER.

490
00:17:30,215 --> 00:17:32,342
[phone rings]

491
00:17:32,342 --> 00:17:33,343
- YEAH?

492
00:17:33,343 --> 00:17:34,469
- HEY, GOB, WHERE ARE YOU?

493
00:17:34,469 --> 00:17:35,512
I NEED YOU TO COME 
TO THE PRISON.

494
00:17:35,512 --> 00:17:38,848
- I'M AT THE PRISON. 
- YOU'RE HERE?

495
00:17:38,848 --> 00:17:40,559
- I'M DELIVERING 
THIS STRONGLY WORDED LETTER

496
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:41,726
I WROTE...

497
00:17:41,726 --> 00:17:44,104
LIT BY NOTHING 
BUT NATURAL LIGHT.

498
00:17:44,104 --> 00:17:46,273
- WELL, HOW WOULD YOU LIKE 
THAT TOUCH LAMP

499
00:17:46,273 --> 00:17:47,441
AND THE OFFICE

500
00:17:47,441 --> 00:17:51,945
AND--WHAT THE HELL-- 
FULL USE OF THE SECRETARY?

501
00:17:53,905 --> 00:17:55,115
- THANK YOU FOR DOING THIS.

502
00:17:55,115 --> 00:17:57,992
IT MEANS A-- 
IT MEANS A LOT.

503
00:17:57,992 --> 00:18:01,163
I, UH--OKAY, 
I'LL GET DOWN ON THE COUCH.

504
00:18:01,163 --> 00:18:04,666
- I'M NOT GOING TO HAVE SEX 
WITH YOU, GEORGE.

505
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:05,667
I CAME TO TELL YOU

506
00:18:05,667 --> 00:18:08,044
HOW MUCH I HATE YOU FOR 
WHAT YOU'VE DONE TO THIS FAMILY.

507
00:18:08,044 --> 00:18:10,255
- YOU'RE ANGRY. 
- YOU'VE RUINED US.

508
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:14,050
- I'VE RUINED US? 
YOU GOT A LOT OF NERVE, HONEY.

509
00:18:14,050 --> 00:18:15,594
THE MILLIONS YOU PISSED AWAY

510
00:18:15,594 --> 00:18:17,346
ON CLOTHING AND JEWELRY 
AND THE SPA TREATMENTS--

511
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:19,723
- YES, TO KEEP YOU INTERESTED 
IN THE ONLY THING

512
00:18:19,723 --> 00:18:21,808
YOU EVER APPRECIATED-- 
MY BODY.

513
00:18:21,808 --> 00:18:24,228
- CAN I HELP IT 
IF YOU'VE GOT A FANTASTIC BODY?

514
00:18:24,228 --> 00:18:29,065
- AND YOU'RE AS POWERFUL 
AS A BEAR.

515
00:18:29,065 --> 00:18:31,610
MY HUSBAND THE BEAR.

516
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:34,613
- THIS BEAR NEEDS 
SOME HONEY, WIFE.

517
00:18:34,613 --> 00:18:37,532
- OH, GOD, I MISSED YOU! 
[gasps, groans]

518
00:18:37,532 --> 00:18:38,783
Narrator: 
GOB, MEANWHILE,

519
00:18:38,783 --> 00:18:41,120
STALLED TO KEEP KITTY 
IN THE OTHER TRAILER.

520
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,704
- GLASSES OFF.

521
00:18:42,704 --> 00:18:44,248
GLASSES ON.

522
00:18:44,248 --> 00:18:46,166
HAIR UP.

523
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:48,084
GLASSES OFF.

524
00:18:48,084 --> 00:18:49,669
DOWN, ON.

525
00:18:49,669 --> 00:18:50,670
HAVE WE DONE UP, OFF?

526
00:18:50,670 --> 00:18:52,381
- OH, GOB, 
THIS IS SO WRONG.

527
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:53,465
- AND BRIGHT.

528
00:18:53,465 --> 00:18:56,385
WRONG A-AND BRIGHT.

529
00:18:56,385 --> 00:18:59,095
THIS--

530
00:18:59,095 --> 00:19:01,140
THAT'S BET--BRIGHTER!

531
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:02,807
GOD! DAMN. 
YOU KNOW WHAT?

532
00:19:02,807 --> 00:19:05,435
I'M GONNA--I'M JUST GONNA 
WASH UP REAL QUICK.

533
00:19:05,435 --> 00:19:07,187
- UH, I THINK 
I'M GONNA GO WITH--

534
00:19:07,187 --> 00:19:08,813
WITH DOWN AND OFF.

535
00:19:08,813 --> 00:19:10,690
Narrator: 
GOB HAD TO DO THE RIGHT THING.

536
00:19:14,819 --> 00:19:17,864
BUT AS HE HEADED TO HIS CAR, 
HE RAN INTO THE WARDEN,

537
00:19:17,864 --> 00:19:19,908
WHO HAD JUST READ 
HIS STRONGLY WORDED LETTER.

538
00:19:19,908 --> 00:19:23,703
- WELL, IF IT ISN'T 
"SINCERELY YOURS."

539
00:19:24,871 --> 00:19:26,540
Narrator: 
AND SO GOB WAS DETAINED

540
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:28,167
AGAINST THE WINDOW 
OF THE TRAILER

541
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:29,543
HIS PARENTS 
WERE BECOMING INTIMATE IN.

542
00:19:29,543 --> 00:19:30,544
[moaning]

543
00:19:30,544 --> 00:19:32,086
- [sobbing] 
OH, GOD, MOMMY!

544
00:19:32,086 --> 00:19:33,422
WHAT DID YOU DO?

545
00:19:37,967 --> 00:19:39,469
- HEY, BUDDY.

546
00:19:39,469 --> 00:19:41,388
- HEY, WHERE WERE YOU?

547
00:19:41,388 --> 00:19:42,972
I HAD TO HELP OUT 
YOUR GRANDFATHER,

548
00:19:42,972 --> 00:19:44,349
AND THEN I HAD TO VOW

549
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:46,310
THAT I WOULD NEVER HELP 
YOUR GRANDFATHER AGAIN.

550
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:48,603
PRETTY MUCH 
A NORMAL DAY FOR ME.

551
00:19:48,603 --> 00:19:51,190
HOW ARE YOU DOING?

552
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:53,817
- I'M FINE, I GUESS. 
IT'S JUST--

553
00:19:53,817 --> 00:19:54,859
YOU KNOW, YOU THINK OF PRISON

554
00:19:54,859 --> 00:19:56,445
AS THIS PLACE 
FULL OF GUILTY PEOPLE

555
00:19:56,445 --> 00:19:58,447
AND IT DOESN'T 
BOTHER YOU THAT MUCH.

556
00:19:58,447 --> 00:20:01,658
BUT IF POP-POP COULD BE THERE, 
THEN ANYBODY COULD BE THERE.

557
00:20:01,658 --> 00:20:02,867
AND I DON'T WANNA 
GO TO PRISON, DAD.

558
00:20:02,867 --> 00:20:04,661
I DON'T THINK I COULD TAKE IT.

559
00:20:04,661 --> 00:20:06,538
I MEAN, I KNOW I ACT TOUGH, 
BUT I--

560
00:20:06,538 --> 00:20:09,791
- IS THIS 
WHAT YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT?

561
00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:11,335
'CAUSE, YOU KNOW, I GOT NEWS--

562
00:20:11,335 --> 00:20:15,129
HE'S, UH-- 
HE'S GUILTY.

563
00:20:15,129 --> 00:20:16,798
- HE IS?

564
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:19,218
- OH, YEAH.

565
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:21,386
INCREDIBLY GUILTY.

566
00:20:24,097 --> 00:20:25,432
- [exhales]

567
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:30,562
narrator: ON THE NEXT 
ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT.

568
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:33,398
TOBIAS TALKS LINDSAY 
INTO ANOTHER SESSION.

569
00:20:33,398 --> 00:20:36,318
- AND I'VE DECIDED THAT...

570
00:20:36,318 --> 00:20:38,320
[sighs]

571
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,113
I WANT TO BECOME 
AN ACTOR TOO.

572
00:20:42,031 --> 00:20:43,492
[laughs]

573
00:20:43,492 --> 00:20:45,660
narrator: AND GEORGE SR. 
MAKES GOOD ON HIS PROMISE

574
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:47,912
TO COME CLEAN 
ON THE INTERNATIONAL ACCOUNTS.

575
00:20:47,912 --> 00:20:51,375
- THERE'S A GOOD CHANCE THAT I--

576
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:58,798
THAT I MAY HAVE COMMITTED SOME, 
UM, LIGHT...

577
00:20:58,798 --> 00:21:00,634
TREASON.

578
00:21:00,634 --> 00:21:01,676
- [groans]
