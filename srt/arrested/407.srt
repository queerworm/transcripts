<i>Hollywood Boulevard at night</i>

2
00:00:17,041 --> 00:00:21,041
<i>is the playground of the hip,</i>
<i>young and successful.</i>

3
00:00:21,083 --> 00:00:25,625
<i>It was into this world that</i>
<i>Gob Bluth had finally arrived,</i>

4
00:00:25,667 --> 00:00:27,750
<i>surrounded for</i>
<i>the first time in his life</i>

5
00:00:27,792 --> 00:00:29,458
<i>by a group of admirers</i>

6
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:33,375
<i>that comprised L.A.'s</i>
<i>latest young elite.</i>

7
00:00:33,417 --> 00:00:36,417
<i>There was Mark, a pop star</i>
<i>who had a level of fame</i>

8
00:00:36,458 --> 00:00:39,959
<i>he could neither appreciate</i>
<i>nor handle.</i>

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
<i>Trout, a Southern boy who had</i>

10
00:00:42,041 --> 00:00:44,417
<i>a Northern man's</i>
<i>taste in women.</i>

11
00:00:44,458 --> 00:00:48,834
<i>J.B.J., a weekend weatherman,</i>
<i>all-week party boy</i>

12
00:00:48,875 --> 00:00:52,041
<i>and a huge disappointment</i>
<i>to his father.</i>

13
00:00:52,083 --> 00:00:54,792
<i>Chris K,</i>
<i>who was a lot like Trout,</i>

14
00:00:54,834 --> 00:00:56,417
<i>but without the accent.</i>

15
00:00:56,458 --> 00:00:58,208
<i>Oakwood, a studio teacher,</i>

16
00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:00,000
<i>who might have had</i>
<i>his own entourage,</i>

17
00:01:00,041 --> 00:01:01,625
<i>if his part hadn't been cut</i>

18
00:01:01,667 --> 00:01:04,875
<i>from the pilot of</i>
Modern Family.

19
00:01:04,917 --> 00:01:08,375
<i>And, of course, there was</i>
<i>the man they called Getaway.</i>

20
00:01:08,417 --> 00:01:11,375
<i>Gob had come far in the year</i>
<i>since his girlfriend,</i>

21
00:01:11,417 --> 00:01:14,000
<i>was less than an hour</i>
<i>from turning 18.</i>

22
00:01:14,041 --> 00:01:15,542
Let me run the clock down
on this thing.

23
00:01:15,583 --> 00:01:18,834
Why don't you just go change
into something a little less...

24
00:01:18,875 --> 00:01:20,291
unflattering, and... I'll, uh...

25
00:01:20,333 --> 00:01:23,083
<i>And he was getting everyone</i>
<i>in the mood for romance.</i>

26
00:01:23,125 --> 00:01:24,417
Guess I'll take my clothes off.

27
00:01:24,458 --> 00:01:27,250
<i>While Ann</i>
<i>less-unflattered herself up,</i>

28
00:01:27,291 --> 00:01:29,333
<i>Gob had an unexpected visitor--</i>

29
00:01:29,375 --> 00:01:32,250
<i>Ann's ex-boyfriend</i>
<i>George Michael,</i>

30
00:01:32,291 --> 00:01:35,417
<i>who, as it turned out,</i>
<i>hadn't completely let go</i>

31
00:01:35,458 --> 00:01:37,333
<i>of the relationship.</i>

32
00:01:37,375 --> 00:01:38,417
(shrieking)

33
00:01:38,458 --> 00:01:40,000
You're lucky that I'm chasing

34
00:01:40,041 --> 00:01:42,083
after our girlfriend,
or I'd have to flatten you!

35
00:01:45,166 --> 00:01:46,625
Whew! Way to plant, Ann.

36
00:01:46,667 --> 00:01:48,667
You told me George Michael
knew about us.

37
00:01:48,709 --> 00:01:51,834
Well, he does now,
my darling plant.

38
00:01:51,875 --> 00:01:52,917
Ann.

39
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:54,375
And...

40
00:01:54,417 --> 00:01:56,875
after I dazzle everyone tonight
on the<i> Queen Mary,</i>

41
00:01:56,917 --> 00:01:58,834
my magic career will take off

42
00:01:58,875 --> 00:02:01,667
as surely as there's a mouse
behind your ear.

43
00:02:01,709 --> 00:02:03,875
(Ann screams)

44
00:02:03,917 --> 00:02:06,542
Well, as surely as there's
a mouse behind your ear.

45
00:02:06,583 --> 00:02:08,125
(Ann screams)

46
00:02:11,417 --> 00:02:12,875
-Mouse behind...
-(Ann screams)

47
00:02:12,917 --> 00:02:14,333
Okay, you are like
the only person I know

48
00:02:14,375 --> 00:02:15,625
who doesn't just love magic.

49
00:02:15,667 --> 00:02:18,417
<i>A poll would confirm</i>
<i>she was far from alone.</i>

50

<i>A close second,</i>

<i>-you, too, America.</i>
<i>-...'cause I quit.</i>

56
00:02:30,667 --> 00:02:32,583
Well, you have to make things
right with George Michael,

57
00:02:32,625 --> 00:02:34,375
otherwise you don't get
to fourth base.

58
00:02:34,417 --> 00:02:37,166
<i>Of course, Ann's concept</i>
<i>of fourth base...</i>

59
00:02:38,542 --> 00:02:40,375
<i>...was very different</i>
<i>than Gob's.</i>

60
00:02:41,667 --> 00:02:44,959
But you have to promise me
you'll always be faithful.

61
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,875
Faithful?
Of course I can be faithful.

62
00:02:47,917 --> 00:02:49,500
Until tonight, when we're
together, you know...

63
00:02:49,542 --> 00:02:50,875
Oh! Until tonight!

64
00:02:50,917 --> 00:02:53,166
Well, of course I can be
faithful-- don't be stupid.

65
00:02:53,208 --> 00:02:54,583
You think I can't
keep it in my pants

66
00:02:54,625 --> 00:02:57,083
in front of a bunch of
doggy old women and my family?

67
00:02:57,125 --> 00:02:58,750
Don't be stupid.

68
00:02:58,792 --> 00:03:00,083
Who am I gonna hit on, stupid?

69
00:03:00,125 --> 00:03:02,166
My sister? Lindsay?

70
00:03:02,208 --> 00:03:03,417
Don't be stupid.

71
00:03:03,458 --> 00:03:05,500
She's my sister; that's gross.

72
00:03:05,542 --> 00:03:07,625
Now...

73
00:03:07,667 --> 00:03:10,250
you...

74
00:03:10,291 --> 00:03:13,291
have got some mice
to scoop out of the sea.

75
00:03:13,333 --> 00:03:15,792
<i>Now the story of a family</i>

76
00:03:15,834 --> 00:03:18,083
<i>whose future</i>
<i>was abruptly canceled,</i>

77
00:03:18,125 --> 00:03:20,667
<i>and the one son</i>
<i>who had no choice</i>

78
00:03:20,709 --> 00:03:22,041
<i>but to keep himself together.</i>

79
00:03:25,667 --> 00:03:28,083
<i>It's Gob's </i>

00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:32,834
NARRATOR:<i> On the day</i>
<i>of the</i> Queen Mary<i> party,</i>

81
00:03:32,875 --> 00:03:34,709
<i>Gob remained faithful to Ann,</i>

82
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:37,083
<i>even in the face</i>
<i>of tremendous temptation.</i>

83
00:03:37,125 --> 00:03:39,625
-Unrelated.
<i>-But there would be</i>

84
00:03:39,667 --> 00:03:43,000
-(screaming)
<i>-no career-making magic show.</i>

85
00:03:43,041 --> 00:03:44,291
<i>It seemed the only "her"</i>

86
00:03:44,333 --> 00:03:46,417
<i>Gob would be</i>
<i>getting off that day</i>

87
00:03:46,458 --> 00:03:47,750
<i>was the</i> Queen Mary.

88
00:03:47,792 --> 00:03:49,417
<i>But then the Queen </i>
<i>changed course,</i>

89
00:03:49,458 --> 00:03:51,709
<i>heading back to shore</i>
<i>before crashing into the jetty</i>

90
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:53,333
<i>and leaving most</i>
<i>of its occupants all wet.</i>

91
00:03:53,375 --> 00:03:55,959
I want all of these
on the insurance form, okay?

92
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
These are all part of an act
I was going to do.

93
00:03:58,041 --> 00:04:00,500
Two drowned white doves,
for "flowers to doves."

94
00:04:00,542 --> 00:04:05,166
This was a rabbit, for "doves to
rabbit"-- also drowned.

95
00:04:05,208 --> 00:04:06,291
These were mice...

96
00:04:06,333 --> 00:04:08,583
TOBIAS:
For "rabbit to mice."

97
00:04:08,625 --> 00:04:12,208
No, that can't be done.

98
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:13,834
No, these were
part of a something

99
00:04:13,875 --> 00:04:15,166
I called "Mice-a-laneous."

100
00:04:15,208 --> 00:04:18,583
"Mouse in purse."
"Mouse in drink."

101
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:20,834
"Here's a mouse, now it's gone."

102
00:04:22,667 --> 00:04:24,000
How'd he do dat?

103
00:04:24,041 --> 00:04:25,625
<i>But it was another man that Gob</i>

104
00:04:25,667 --> 00:04:27,375
<i>needed to make things</i>
<i>right with...</i>

105
00:04:27,417 --> 00:04:28,834
George Michael...

106
00:04:28,875 --> 00:04:31,417
<i>...if he was ever going</i>
<i>to deflower Ann Veal.</i>

107
00:04:31,458 --> 00:04:33,333
Uncle Gob.

108
00:04:33,375 --> 00:04:34,709
Are we good?

109
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:36,250
(George Michael sighs)

110
00:04:36,291 --> 00:04:37,834
(voice breaking):
No.

111
00:04:37,875 --> 00:04:40,250
No, how could we possibly be?

112
00:04:40,291 --> 00:04:43,208
But... but are we, are we good?

113
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:45,959
No!
You stole my girlfriend.

114
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,667
That's a tough thing,
and, you know,

115
00:04:47,709 --> 00:04:50,208
sometimes you have to ask
yourself: "Are we good?"

116
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:52,125
Is it over between you guys?

117
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:53,917
Oh, no.
But are we good?

118
00:04:53,959 --> 00:04:56,375
I don't know what you want
to hear from me, Uncle Gob.

119
00:04:56,417 --> 00:04:58,792
-I mean, yes, we are good...
-There it is!

120
00:04:58,834 --> 00:05:00,083
There it is!

121
00:05:00,125 --> 00:05:01,834
Ah, from a nephew to his uncle,

122
00:05:01,875 --> 00:05:04,375
and just the "yes,"
the much-vaunted "yes,"

123
00:05:04,417 --> 00:05:05,625
that he gets.

124
00:05:05,667 --> 00:05:07,083
Look at you, full of "yes."

125
00:05:07,125 --> 00:05:09,166
Look at how much "yes"
is in you!

126
00:05:09,208 --> 00:05:11,000
I knew it! I knew I'd get
that "yes" from you.

127
00:05:11,041 --> 00:05:12,667
Look who got a "yes"!
Got my "yes."

128
00:05:12,709 --> 00:05:16,583
<i>And Gob realized that there was</i>
<i>finally nothing</i>

129
00:05:16,625 --> 00:05:18,333
<i>standing in the way</i>
<i>of a loving,</i>

130
00:05:18,375 --> 00:05:20,625
<i>committed relationship</i>
<i>with Ann.</i>

138

For a second, I thought
that was a real guy.

139
00:05:42,792 --> 00:05:45,750
So, listen, I talked to George
Michael and everything's cool.

140
00:05:45,792 --> 00:05:47,291
I need to tell you something,
though.

141
00:05:47,333 --> 00:05:49,500
I've been doing some thinking

142
00:05:49,542 --> 00:05:50,709
and I... I just don't...

143
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:53,125
<i>But as she unzipped</i>
<i>her pajamas,</i>

144
00:05:53,166 --> 00:05:55,834
<i>it reminded him</i>
<i>of past situations</i>

(light switch clicks)

148
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
<i>And later, Gob once again tried</i>
<i>to find a compassionate way</i>

149
00:06:09,041 --> 00:06:10,709
<i>to end the relationship.</i>

150
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:12,291
So how did you like your egg?

151
00:06:12,333 --> 00:06:14,000
I said you were fine.

152
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:16,291
So, was there something you
wanted to talk about

153
00:06:16,333 --> 00:06:17,834
when you came in through
my window?

154
00:06:19,792 --> 00:06:21,083
Gob, what is it?

155
00:06:23,792 --> 00:06:27,125
What... what... is it?

156
00:06:27,166 --> 00:06:29,750
I... (laughs) You...

00:07:18,917 --> 00:07:20,750
Gob! Calm down!

175
00:07:20,792 --> 00:07:24,333
Listen, we had
a great night together.

176
00:07:24,375 --> 00:07:26,333
I understand if you need
your freedom.

177
00:07:26,375 --> 00:07:28,542
Well... marry me.

178
00:07:28,583 --> 00:07:31,750
Yes, I'll...
yes, I'll marry you, Gob!

179
00:07:31,792 --> 00:07:33,959
<i>Of course, Gob meant it</i>

-And may I add: marry me.
-...marry me.

laughing)

<i>Gob shared his happy news</i>

Mouth.

Her.

Yeah, me and Blank are getting

the old Christian magic act
back together.

204
00:08:36,208 --> 00:08:37,875
I mean, you don't expect people
to actually believe

205
00:08:37,917 --> 00:08:40,417
that I'm Jesus,
if I'm walking around in rags.

You're resurrecting
that mumbo-jumbo?

Look, everybody's got a gimmick.

208
00:08:45,333 --> 00:08:48,166

Me.

-You haven't.
-Well, my wedding's

221
00:09:17,834 --> 00:09:19,583
going to be religious-y and epic

222
00:09:19,625 --> 00:09:21,792
which is why I need more of that

223
00:09:21,834 --> 00:09:23,500
Thanks, Mike.

00:09:23,542 --> 00:09:26,583

225
00:09:26,625 --> 00:09:27,625

And welcome to

And As It Is Such, So Also
As Such Is It Unto You.

229
00:09:35,125 --> 00:09:37,625
Excuse me, Father Marsala,
I hate to interrupt,

230
00:09:37,667 --> 00:09:40,125
but I am so excited today.

231
00:09:40,166 --> 00:09:41,625
My lovely Ann...

232
00:09:41,667 --> 00:09:44,000
-Who?
-My daughter.

233
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:46,208
Oh. I didn't know
you had a daughter.

234
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:47,959
You've met her several times.

235
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,333
Oh.

236
00:09:49,375 --> 00:09:51,458
She's sitting right next to you.

237
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:52,834
Oh!

238
00:09:52,875 --> 00:09:54,125
That's why she's there.

239
00:09:54,166 --> 00:09:55,375
I thought you were Hair.

240
00:09:55,417 --> 00:09:57,458
Hair?

241
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:00,542
No, she's my daughter,
and she's getting married!

242
00:10:00,583 --> 00:10:01,959
To this good man.

243
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,083
(applause)

244
00:10:03,125 --> 00:10:04,542
Well, and as it is such,

245
00:10:04,583 --> 00:10:06,542
so also as such is it
unto you, young man.

246
00:10:06,583 --> 00:10:08,125
You got it.

247
00:10:08,166 --> 00:10:11,458
Unto you, as well...
dear f... heavenly fathers.

248
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:13,458
MARSALA: Well, we have
a really great show today

249
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:14,750
surrounding the Scriptures...

250
00:10:14,792 --> 00:10:15,959
GOB:
We have an announcement to make.

251
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,750
I have an announcement to make:

252
00:10:17,792 --> 00:10:22,667
that we would like to televise
our marriage, here on this show.

253
00:10:22,709 --> 00:10:25,333
-(applause)
-My goodness.

254
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:27,792
Oh, um... we hadn't heard of it.

255
00:10:27,834 --> 00:10:28,875
Did you...?

256
00:10:28,917 --> 00:10:30,166
Well, no, but that's... no...

257
00:10:30,208 --> 00:10:32,583
What an idea. I think...

258
00:10:32,625 --> 00:10:34,792
Well, this show is about
the spirit of inclusion,

259
00:10:34,834 --> 00:10:36,250
-so I would love to say...
-Well, great!

260
00:10:36,291 --> 00:10:38,375
Then I, too,
have an announcement to make!

261
00:10:38,417 --> 00:10:39,917
At our wedding,
I will be performing

262
00:10:39,959 --> 00:10:43,250
one of my
famous magical illusions.

263
00:10:43,291 --> 00:10:45,208
That once your eyes
have beholden it,

264
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:47,083
you will put no god before me,

265
00:10:47,125 --> 00:10:49,542
because of its spectacularity.

266
00:10:52,458 --> 00:10:56,625
And, of course, I only propose
to do this out of love for...

267
00:10:56,667 --> 00:10:57,834
ANN:
Ann.

268
00:10:57,875 --> 00:11:00,959
And... God.

269
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,709
Love for and God.

270
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:07,709
Let me pray.
Dearest beloved gods...

271
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:10,709
<i>Gob was feeling bolder,</i>
<i>which was perhaps why</i>

272
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:12,959
<i>Michael returned home</i>
<i>to find this.</i>

273
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,667
GOB:
And yea, as if to be arisen

274
00:11:15,709 --> 00:11:20,875
the third or fourth day with all
the magic of Jesus Christ!

275
00:11:20,917 --> 00:11:23,750
MICHAEL: Sorry.
Wasn't on there too good.

276
00:11:23,792 --> 00:11:25,583
-(Gob grunting, groaning)
-You okay?

277
00:11:25,625 --> 00:11:28,792
Yeah, it's just part of my...
illusion for the wedding.

278
00:11:28,834 --> 00:11:29,875
Yeah, what's the illusion?

279
00:11:29,917 --> 00:11:31,291
That you actually
love the bride?

280
00:11:31,333 --> 00:11:34,208
Hey...
that's good patter.

281
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:37,166
'Cause I need people to root
for the Jesus character.

282
00:11:37,208 --> 00:11:39,250
I don't remember
a biblical passage where Jesus

283
00:11:39,291 --> 00:11:40,792
came out of a boulder--
is it in there?

284
00:11:40,834 --> 00:11:41,959
Oh, no, no, no,
the boulder's my escape plan.

285
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,083
They think I'm somewhere else.

286
00:11:43,125 --> 00:11:44,625
I'm actually in the boulder.

287
00:11:44,667 --> 00:11:46,125
But I didn't come here to talk

288
00:11:46,166 --> 00:11:47,542
-about my magic act, Michael.
-Okay.

289
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:51,083
I came to ask you
to be my best man...

290
00:11:51,125 --> 00:11:52,625
slash-assistant.

291
00:11:52,667 --> 00:11:54,375
And then we'll walk through
the act later, of course.

292
00:11:54,417 --> 00:11:56,291
-I mean, not now.
-No, we're not going to,

293
00:11:56,333 --> 00:11:57,959
'cause you know,
I'm out of the family.

294
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,166
Did you not get that
when I announced it

295
00:11:59,208 --> 00:12:01,542
over at Mom's place?

296
00:12:01,583 --> 00:12:03,000
I feel like I was out
of the room at that point.

297
00:12:03,041 --> 00:12:04,834
I am done with this family.

298
00:12:04,875 --> 00:12:07,208
I hope you've saved some money
'cause you...

299
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:09,750
<i>♪ Hello, darkness,</i>
<i>my old friend... ♪</i>

300
00:12:09,792 --> 00:12:11,875
MICHAEL:
<i>Well, the gist of it was:</i>

301
00:12:11,917 --> 00:12:13,542
"You know what?
I'm done with this family.

302
00:12:13,583 --> 00:12:15,208
"I hope you saved your money
'cause you're

303
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:16,959
going to need
every last dime now."

304
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,709
Maybe you could be a centurion,

305
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:20,709
kind of standing over
where they think that I'll be.

306
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:22,333
I'm not going to be in the act.

307
00:12:22,375 --> 00:12:23,750
Might be a great promotion
for the Bluth Company.

308
00:12:23,792 --> 00:12:25,041
No, Bluth Company's done.

309
00:12:25,083 --> 00:12:27,375
I started my own company:
Michael B. Company.

310
00:12:27,417 --> 00:12:28,750
I have a bee company.

311
00:12:28,792 --> 00:12:29,834
You stole my idea?

312
00:12:29,875 --> 00:12:31,417
Uh-uh, I did not steal your...

313
00:12:31,458 --> 00:12:33,875
We sell...
It would take hours.

314
00:12:33,917 --> 00:12:35,000
How's that going, by the way?

315
00:12:35,041 --> 00:12:37,000
Uh, not so good.

316
00:12:37,041 --> 00:12:38,667
I've been keeping the bees
in my apartment.

317
00:12:38,709 --> 00:12:41,000
I was using my magic smoke
on them.

318
00:12:41,041 --> 00:12:43,000
And my bees are dropping
like flies,

319
00:12:43,041 --> 00:12:44,417
and I need them to fly
like bees.

320
00:12:44,458 --> 00:12:46,041
And so I've got them out
at a bee hospital,

321
00:12:46,083 --> 00:12:47,250
which is not cheap,
which is another reason

322
00:12:47,291 --> 00:12:48,875
I need to be a famous magician.

323
00:12:48,917 --> 00:12:50,792
Yeah, well, listen,
you're with my son's ex,

324
00:12:50,834 --> 00:12:52,458
so I can't support the wedding.

325
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:56,750
What if I don't actually
get married?

326
00:12:56,792 --> 00:12:58,625
I don't think you'd need
a best man, then, right?

327
00:12:58,667 --> 00:13:00,000
No, I guess, at that point,

328
00:13:00,041 --> 00:13:02,125
it'd really be more...
assistant.

329
00:13:02,166 --> 00:13:03,458
Is this an escape act?

330
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:05,875
-Are you running again?
-What do you want from me?

331
00:13:05,917 --> 00:13:08,625
Marriage is a lot of pressure,
and she's not into it.

332
00:13:08,667 --> 00:13:10,250
Meanwhile, I'm working out
like crazy,

333
00:13:10,291 --> 00:13:12,250
my diet has become insane,

334
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:15,917
and this Jesus character--
I mean, he was shredded.

335
00:13:15,959 --> 00:13:17,625
Meanwhile, we have sex one time,

336
00:13:17,667 --> 00:13:20,333
and then she's just,
you know, over it.

337
00:13:20,375 --> 00:13:21,709
Lets herself go.

338
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:24,375
Her stomach's out to here.

339
00:13:24,417 --> 00:13:28,000
You know, your whole life
is an escape act,

340
00:13:28,041 --> 00:13:30,250
and this girl seems
like she really likes you.

341
00:13:30,291 --> 00:13:31,834
Why don't you just try
to work it out

342
00:13:31,875 --> 00:13:34,166
and just stop running...?

343
00:13:37,041 --> 00:13:39,250
Yeah, I know you're
in the boulder.

344
00:13:39,291 --> 00:13:41,250
GOB:
But how'd I get in the boulder?

346
00:13:42,875 --> 00:13:45,500

347
00:13:45,542 --> 00:13:47,417

348
00:13:47,458 --> 00:13:50,500
<i>no one else</i>

ANN:
<i>I know it's bad luck for you</i>

350
00:13:52,041 --> 00:13:54,250
to see me in my gown
before the wedding.

351
00:13:56,375 --> 00:13:58,041
Well, hopefully I haven't.

352
00:13:58,083 --> 00:13:59,625
You're angry.

353
00:13:59,667 --> 00:14:01,542
Why? Because none of my family
has shown up

354
00:14:01,583 --> 00:14:04,542
and the only person I recognize
out there is Tony Wonder,

355
00:14:04,583 --> 00:14:06,667
who's only shown up
hoping that I'd fail?

356
00:14:06,709 --> 00:14:09,625
I don't know what
your surprise trick is, but...

357
00:14:09,667 --> 00:14:11,291
I know it's going to be great.

358
00:14:11,333 --> 00:14:15,041
And as for your family...
you have a new family now.

359
00:14:15,083 --> 00:14:16,333
(chuckles)

360
00:14:18,041 --> 00:14:20,625
I don't want these.

361
00:14:21,041 --> 00:14:23,125
-Tobias!
-Gob.

362
00:14:23,166 --> 00:14:25,500
-Thanks for coming.
-Oh, how could I not?

363
00:14:25,542 --> 00:14:27,458
I'm playing
Roman Centurion Number Two.

364
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:29,959
-What are you playing?
-I'm the groom.

365
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,291
I didn't know there
was a groom part.

366
00:14:31,333 --> 00:14:33,458
You know, Betty
at<i> And As It Is Such,</i>

<i>So Also As Such</i>
Is It Unto You casting

368
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:37,041
told me this was all biblical.

369
00:14:37,083 --> 00:14:38,834
Wait, you're not here
for the wedding?

370
00:14:38,875 --> 00:14:42,083
Well, thank you very much
for your vote of confidence.

371
00:14:42,125 --> 00:14:43,875
I'll have you know I've worked
for the Miracle Network

372

NARRATOR:
<i>But soon,</i>

385
00:15:13,166 --> 00:15:14,750
<i>the wedding began.</i>

386
00:15:14,792 --> 00:15:16,667
PASTOR VEAL:
So, it truly is a blessed day.

387
00:15:16,709 --> 00:15:18,542
I believe that we
are all blessed,

388
00:15:18,583 --> 00:15:20,250
uh, to be gathering here

389
00:15:20,291 --> 00:15:23,458
at the Church
of the Holy Eternal Rapture.

390
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:26,875
Uh, we have almost arrived
at that glorious moment

391
00:15:26,917 --> 00:15:29,458
where we join together
these two very special people,

392
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:32,250
but first, my almost son-in-law

393
00:15:32,291 --> 00:15:35,250
has something he'd like
to share with all of us,

394
00:15:35,291 --> 00:15:37,250
so, um...

395
00:15:37,291 --> 00:15:39,542
ladies and gentlemen, uh,

396
00:15:39,583 --> 00:15:43,166
please enjoy a magical...

397
00:15:43,208 --> 00:15:45,166
uh, trick.

398
00:15:51,625 --> 00:15:54,125
Thanks for that killer intro.

399
00:15:56,041 --> 00:15:58,917
It's true,
this is a magical trick.

400
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:02,291
If what Jesus did was a trick.

401
00:16:02,333 --> 00:16:04,250
(crowd gasping)

402
00:16:04,291 --> 00:16:05,834
I say it wasn't.

403
00:16:05,875 --> 00:16:07,875
(laughter, applause)

404
00:16:10,208 --> 00:16:11,750
It was an illusion.

405
00:16:11,792 --> 00:16:13,208
(crowd gasping softly)

406
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:16,166
TOBIAS:
Ooh, they did not like that one.

407
00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:19,458
I don't take notes from you,
Centurion Number Two.

408
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:21,792
Just turn this thing around.

409
00:16:23,583 --> 00:16:26,333
I am not the real Jesus.

410
00:16:31,917 --> 00:16:35,959
I am the Amazing Jesus!

411
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:41,208
No? I thought that that
would be up your... alley.

412
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:43,166
Yes, the real Jesus

413
00:16:43,208 --> 00:16:45,542
came off the cross
and went into his cave...

414
00:16:45,583 --> 00:16:47,291
a dead man.

415
00:16:49,333 --> 00:16:50,834
NARRATOR:
<i>And Gob's escape boulder</i>

416
00:16:50,875 --> 00:16:52,542
<i>was wheeled up to the trick.</i>

417
00:16:52,583 --> 00:16:55,500
But was he crazy enough
to do it... handcuffed?

418
00:16:55,542 --> 00:16:58,041
Handcuff the King of the Jews!

419
00:16:58,083 --> 00:17:00,333
GOB:
You don't have words here...

420
00:17:00,375 --> 00:17:03,458
Pastor Veal, if you don't mind,
please go up into the cave

421
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:06,333
and assure everyone
that there's no way to escape:

422
00:17:06,375 --> 00:17:08,625
no trapdoors,
no secret compartments,

423
00:17:08,667 --> 00:17:10,125
no way to get out.

424
00:17:10,166 --> 00:17:11,375
Thank you very...

425
00:17:11,417 --> 00:17:12,917
Pastor Veal, let me remind you

426
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:16,375
that you are in a church
in front of your daughter,

427
00:17:16,417 --> 00:17:18,625
your congregation, God.

428
00:17:18,667 --> 00:17:20,083
You cannot tell a lie.

429
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:25,250
Right, nothing
out of the ordinary?

430
00:17:27,166 --> 00:17:29,667
-No, I-I didn't see anything.
-Yes.

431
00:17:29,709 --> 00:17:34,709
Jesus went into the cave,
and he arose three days later.

432
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:37,125
But I'm not going to lock myself
in the cave

433
00:17:37,166 --> 00:17:38,792
for three days
before this wedding ceremony.

434
00:17:38,834 --> 00:17:41,750
No, no. No, no, no.

435
00:17:41,792 --> 00:17:45,291
I plan on beating his record
by two full weeks!

436
00:17:45,333 --> 00:17:48,041
(dramatic music playing)

437
00:18:05,583 --> 00:18:08,000
Into the cave with you!

438
00:18:08,041 --> 00:18:10,291
GOB: No, I said don't underline
the "you" in that.

439
00:18:10,333 --> 00:18:12,750
NARRATOR:<i> Unfortunately,</i>
Gob was not able to open

440
00:18:12,792 --> 00:18:15,542
<i>the secret compartment that</i>
<i>contained the handcuff key.</i>

441
00:18:15,583 --> 00:18:17,500
It's not going to work. Okay,
uh, this isn't going to work.

442
00:18:17,542 --> 00:18:19,041
Let's do...
let's do mouse in drink.

443
00:18:19,083 --> 00:18:20,542
Let's do mouse in drink.
Just get these people

444
00:18:20,583 --> 00:18:22,083
some drinks.
We'll just get a mouse.

445
00:18:22,125 --> 00:18:24,333
No, no, no. No, no, no,
you know not what you do!

446
00:18:24,375 --> 00:18:28,125
<i>But it very clearly said</i>

447

<i>to ignore</i>

<i>which meant that,</i>

449
00:18:33,333 --> 00:18:35,333
But if my hands are handcuffed,
I'll never...

<i>...Gob was unable</i>
<i>to break his fall</i>

<i>was sealed inside the cave,</i>

454

<i>the real Gob's fate</i>
<i>was sealed, as well.</i>

455
00:18:50,667 --> 00:18:54,625
Well, I guess...
we'll wait two weeks...

456
00:18:57,166 --> 00:18:59,750
...and see if he's in there.

457
00:18:59,792 --> 00:19:02,667
Is that okay with you, Ann?

458
00:19:02,709 --> 00:19:05,125
He's not coming back.

464
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:22,917
11 exciting days, um,

although nothing's
really happened.

466
00:19:25,083 --> 00:19:26,208
Day 11.

467
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:28,709
Once he gets out,
it's going to be

468
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:31,458
a beautiful, beautiful wedding.

469

here. 
-I guess, if he comes back

474
00:19:43,041 --> 00:19:45,208
from the dead,
we could just get a stepladder.

475
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:46,667
-Guys, this, too.
<i>-And a hoarse,</i>

<i>as the boulder was shipped</i>
<i>to a storage unit in Tustin.</i>

479

482

<i>At the end of two weeks,</i>

-three, two, one.
-The dead will walk amongst us.

-I knew it.
-TOBIAS: Oh, there's a note.

"If I have not yet returned,
I am in the Rapture."

490
00:20:25,208 --> 00:20:29,458
Oh, and then it says,
"Love each other."

491
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:31,375
MRS. VEAL: What does he think
we've been doing?

492
00:20:31,417 --> 00:20:33,625
I loaned him $1,000.

Jesus, there's a man in there.

Anybody?

-Nope.

502

You humiliated me.

506

You made a mockery
of my religion

507

and you ruined our wedding.

508
00:21:09,208 --> 00:21:12,625
Our first fight,
and like all fights,

509
00:21:12,667 --> 00:21:14,750
you're a little right,
I'm a little right.

510
00:21:14,792 --> 00:21:16,375
I sold your cave on Craigslist.

511
00:21:16,417 --> 00:21:18,375
So it was all worth it.

512
00:21:18,417 --> 00:21:21,166
We have money to start
our life together.

513
00:21:21,208 --> 00:21:25,083
Now we have our nest, egg-- Ann.

514
00:21:25,125 --> 00:21:28,500
Now we have our, our nest, Ann.

515
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:31,625
I'm leaving you, Gob.

516
00:21:31,667 --> 00:21:33,458
I don't love you anymore.

517
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:36,458
I feel sorry for you, and
you're gonna be alone forever

518
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:39,000
unless you let the Holy Ghost
inside you.

519
00:21:39,041 --> 00:21:41,041
(laughing):
The, the Holy...

520
00:21:43,875 --> 00:21:45,875
(stammering)

521
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:53,625
You know what?
I hope you read this.

522
00:21:53,667 --> 00:21:56,417
NARRATOR:<i> And maybe it was</i>
<i>the fact that he had nothing</i>

523
00:21:56,458 --> 00:21:59,250
<i>in his system</i>
<i>but two weeks of candy vines,</i>

524
00:21:59,291 --> 00:22:01,000
<i>but it did get through to him.</i>

525
00:22:01,041 --> 00:22:02,834
Steve.

526
00:22:02,875 --> 00:22:05,041
It's me. Uh, I-I wanted
to let you know

527
00:22:05,083 --> 00:22:10,834
that I am... I'm-I'm ready to...
to... to...

528
00:22:10,875 --> 00:22:14,500
let the son of Gob enfold me.

529
00:22:14,542 --> 00:22:17,125
Have you been to the club And,

530
00:22:17,166 --> 00:22:19,542
owned by Jeremy "Pivan"?

531
00:22:19,583 --> 00:22:20,834
I'm gonna be there tonight
about 8:00.

532
00:22:20,875 --> 00:22:22,583
Maybe you could join me,
I don't...

533
00:22:22,625 --> 00:22:24,917
Obviously it's, it's me,
your fa...

534
00:22:24,959 --> 00:22:26,834
(beep)

535
00:22:27,875 --> 00:22:28,834
Nah, he got it.

536
00:22:28,875 --> 00:22:31,458
Okay.

537
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:33,208
NARRATOR:
<i>Gob was waiting to meet his son</i>

538
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:35,083
<i>at a bar and feeling</i>
<i>a little vulnerable.</i>

539
00:22:35,125 --> 00:22:36,834
Lost my wife, lost my career.

540
00:22:36,875 --> 00:22:39,041
When I was in that storage unit
at the bottom of that rock,

541
00:22:39,083 --> 00:22:41,208
it was like I hit...

542
00:22:41,250 --> 00:22:42,625
-Rock bottom?
-No, no, not that.

543
00:22:42,667 --> 00:22:44,625
More like a trending
downward moment

544
00:22:44,667 --> 00:22:47,500
that just-- I don't know.

545
00:22:47,542 --> 00:22:50,834
Maybe I'm being tested like
that guy "Jawb" from the Bible.

546
00:22:50,875 --> 00:22:52,333
-(pronounces correctly): Job.
-Yes?

547
00:22:52,375 --> 00:22:53,333
Job.

548
00:22:53,375 --> 00:22:54,625
Yes, sir.

549
00:22:54,667 --> 00:22:56,000
-Job. 
-Yeah.

550
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:58,083
-Look, I, I feel sorry
for you, Pops.
-Hey, pal,

551
00:22:58,125 --> 00:22:59,959
I'm not that much older
than you, guy.

552
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,083
-(chuckles) 
-Nah, I'm just here,
I'm looking for my son.

553
00:23:02,125 --> 00:23:04,750
I'm trying to get some cash
out of him, actually.

554
00:23:04,792 --> 00:23:07,125
You, you have another son?

555
00:23:07,166 --> 00:23:08,583
(Steve laughing)

556
00:23:08,625 --> 00:23:10,583
I have a brother?

557
00:23:10,625 --> 00:23:11,709
Oh, man.

558
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:14,333
Yes, Steve.

559
00:23:14,375 --> 00:23:15,792
Yeah.

560
00:23:15,834 --> 00:23:17,875
-What's his name?
-Dave.

561
00:23:17,917 --> 00:23:19,709
Oh, Dave Holt.

562
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:21,417
-Yeah, Dave Holt.
-Yes.

563
00:23:21,458 --> 00:23:22,875
NARRATOR:<i> Yes, Gob</i>
<i>had been speaking to his son</i>

564
00:23:22,917 --> 00:23:24,625
<i>for an hour and a half.</i>

565
00:23:24,667 --> 00:23:26,250
-Wait, your mom's name is Eve?
-Yeah.

566
00:23:26,291 --> 00:23:28,625
God, I (bleep) a chick
named Eve once.

567
00:23:28,667 --> 00:23:30,667
Biggest mistake of my life.

568
00:23:30,709 --> 00:23:32,125
NARRATOR:
<i>And perhaps it was because</i>

569
00:23:32,166 --> 00:23:34,125
<i>Gob was inadvertently so warm</i>

570
00:23:34,166 --> 00:23:36,000
<i>to his son that Steve</i>

571
00:23:36,041 --> 00:23:37,792
<i>-offered him a job. </i>
-I don't even really have a job.

572
00:23:37,834 --> 00:23:39,834
Would you want
to come work with me?

573
00:23:39,875 --> 00:23:41,000
I mean, I...

574
00:23:41,041 --> 00:23:42,208
Are you serious?

575
00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:44,041
I mean, I'm in pest control, but

576
00:23:44,083 --> 00:23:46,041
father and son.

577
00:23:46,083 --> 00:23:47,750
What a great team.

578
00:23:47,792 --> 00:23:48,959
It would be a great team.

579
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,083
I mean, I don't care.

580
00:23:50,125 --> 00:23:51,667
Pest control-- I don't know.

581
00:23:51,709 --> 00:23:53,500
As long as I'm not being
a pest to you, right?

582
00:23:53,542 --> 00:23:55,041
-No, never.
-I mean, I'm kidding.

583
00:23:55,083 --> 00:23:57,083
(Gob mumbling)

584
00:23:59,333 --> 00:24:01,667
Where is your place of business?

585
00:24:01,709 --> 00:24:03,125
-181...
-181...

586
00:24:03,166 --> 00:24:05,458
-Manville. 
-Manville.

587
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:06,875
Manville.

588
00:24:06,917 --> 00:24:09,750
What time do you start
this pest control?

589
00:24:09,792 --> 00:24:11,041
7:00 a.m.

590
00:24:11,083 --> 00:24:12,709
Then I'll be there at 6:45

591
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:14,250
with two cups of coffee.

592
00:24:14,291 --> 00:24:17,959
Oh, Dad, this is
the greatest day of my life.

593
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,000
No, this is the greatest day
of<i> my</i> life.

594
00:24:21,041 --> 00:24:23,375
<i>And perhaps it was because</i>
it was<i> such a great day...</i>

595
00:24:23,417 --> 00:24:25,375
-6:45. -6:45.
<i>-...that Gob</i> decided 
to stay at the bar...

596
00:24:25,417 --> 00:24:27,834
-6:45.
<i>-...and show off a little.</i>

597
00:24:27,875 --> 00:24:31,333
I bet it's been a long time
since you've seen your...

598
00:24:33,250 --> 00:24:34,750
-...cherry.
-I have lupus.

599
00:24:34,792 --> 00:24:36,709
(spits)
Could have warned a guy.

600
00:24:36,750 --> 00:24:38,834
<i>But showing off did catch</i>
<i>the attention of someone.</i>

601
00:24:38,875 --> 00:24:40,083
That was the real deal, huh?

602
00:24:40,125 --> 00:24:41,875
How about this?

603
00:24:41,917 --> 00:24:44,417
How about you do that cherry
trick for my boy Mark Cherry?

604
00:24:44,458 --> 00:24:45,875
Mark Cherry
the baby-faced singer

605
00:24:45,917 --> 00:24:47,667
or Marc Cherry
the baby-faced showrunner?

606
00:24:47,709 --> 00:24:49,667
Baby-faced singer--
right over there, man.

607
00:24:49,709 --> 00:24:52,041
He has loved magic
ever since he was a kid.

608
00:24:52,083 --> 00:24:54,750
NARRATOR:<i> Which was two years</i>
<i>earlier, when Mark Cherry was</i>

609
00:24:54,792 --> 00:24:57,375
<i>the star of a cable teen sitcom</i>
<i>called</i>

00:25:12,083 --> 00:25:14,709
-to do a magic trick for you.
-No, it's an illusion.

617
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:16,959
A trick is something
a whore does for...

618
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,083
Do a trick and I'll pay
for your bar tab.

619
00:25:19,125 --> 00:25:20,625
-Who wants a trick?
-ALL: Yeah!

620
00:25:20,667 --> 00:25:22,875
(all cheering)

621
00:25:22,917 --> 00:25:24,834
NARRATOR:<i> Gob had them</i>
<i>in the palm of his hand.</i>

622
00:25:24,875 --> 00:25:27,625
<i>He even got the attention</i>

623
00:25:27,667 --> 00:25:29,375
<i>-of a still out-of-control</i>
Rebel Alley... 
-Do it again.

-I missed it.
<i>-...who was</i>

<i>...she'd soon be required</i>

627
00:25:36,375 --> 00:25:37,458
Fire, fire!

628
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:39,834
Never yell "fire"
in a crowded place.

629
00:25:39,875 --> 00:25:41,041
It's never funny.

630
00:25:41,083 --> 00:25:42,792
That's always funny.

631
00:25:42,834 --> 00:25:44,750
NARRATOR:<i> And she was intrigued</i>
<i>by this magical man.</i>

632

-Oh...
-Whoa.

633
00:25:46,375 --> 00:25:48,041
That is a David Spade.

634
00:25:48,083 --> 00:25:50,667

Check your purse.

636
00:25:51,792 --> 00:25:53,625
-(Gob chuckles)
-Nice.

637
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,125
Oh, man, paparazzo.

638
00:25:56,166 --> 00:25:57,917
Oh, shoot, great.

639
00:25:57,959 --> 00:25:59,917
The last thing I need is to be
seen partying with some tweens.

640
00:25:59,959 --> 00:26:01,917
I'm trying to clean up my act.

641
00:26:01,959 --> 00:26:03,792
Dude, network's gonna flip

642
00:26:03,834 --> 00:26:05,166
if there's another drunk photo
of you.

643
00:26:05,208 --> 00:26:06,458
-I know.
-We got to get you away

644
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:07,875
-from this place, okay?
-Getting away

645
00:26:07,917 --> 00:26:10,083
is kind of my specialty.

646
00:26:10,125 --> 00:26:13,417
I'll have us out of here
in a flash.

647
00:26:13,458 --> 00:26:15,291
All right.

648
00:26:15,333 --> 00:26:17,083
Let's get out of here while
they still got lighter fluid

649
00:26:17,125 --> 00:26:18,333
-in their eyes.
-Go, baby.

Nice moves, Getaway.

Oh.

654
00:26:25,667 --> 00:26:27,041
Okay.

NARRATOR:<i> Gob had been accepted</i>

I'll be with you in a second,
I'll be right there.

662

Start without me,
just start without me.

663
00:26:43,208 --> 00:26:44,834
Don't worry!

664
00:26:44,875 --> 00:26:47,208
He's not coming back.

665
00:26:49,041 --> 00:26:51,000
NARRATOR:
<i>Gob was living the dream,</i>

666
00:26:51,041 --> 00:26:54,792
<i>and felt like he was</i>
<i>in the center of the entourage,</i>

00:26:54,834 --> 00:26:58,041
<i>even though he was three away</i>
<i>from the center at the closest,</i>

668
00:26:58,083 --> 00:27:00,583
<i>and it was pop star</i>
<i>Mark Cherry's dream.</i>

669
00:27:03,542 --> 00:27:07,542
Hey, I'm with, with the guys.

670
00:27:07,583 --> 00:27:08,792
Keep the limo running, Getaway.

671
00:27:10,792 --> 00:27:12,250
That's my job.

737

NARRATOR:<i> In an effort to remain</i>
<i>popular with the gang,</i>

740
00:29:56,333 --> 00:29:59,417
<i>Gob stopped in front of a club</i>

GOB: Who wants to party

Uh, me, me, me...

00:30:04,166 --> 00:30:06,625
That's one forget-me-now saved,
huh, fellas?

744
00:30:06,667 --> 00:30:10,250
Oh, looks like we got a real
live one, and by alive, I mean

745
00:30:10,291 --> 00:30:12,208

-Yeah.

752
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:23,000
You know what'd be really cool?

753
00:30:23,041 --> 00:30:24,834
If you shut the partition.

754
00:30:24,875 --> 00:30:27,834
It'd be like, uh, like a joke,
like you're our limo driver...

755
00:30:27,875 --> 00:30:29,333
That would be hilarious, right?

756
00:30:29,375 --> 00:30:34,000
"Oh, yes, very good,
sir, very good."

757
00:30:34,041 --> 00:30:35,917
Right?

758
00:30:35,959 --> 00:30:38,834
Be like, "I'm... I'm just
driving the queen of England,"

759
00:30:38,875 --> 00:30:40,083
but we're still--
we're taking our clothes off.

I see this boat and I'm like,
"Those are police boats,"

773
00:31:12,875 --> 00:31:14,208
so, anyway, I'm running around

774
00:31:14,250 --> 00:31:16,000

807
