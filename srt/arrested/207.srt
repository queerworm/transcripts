00:00:01,417 --> 00:00:03,086
male narrator: NOW THE STORY 
OF A WEALTHY FAMILY

2
00:00:03,086 --> 00:00:04,295
WHO LOST EVERYTHING...

3
00:00:04,295 --> 00:00:06,256
AND THE ONE SON 
WHO HAD NO CHOICE...

4
00:00:06,256 --> 00:00:08,216
BUT TO KEEP THEM ALL TOGETHER.

5
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:15,973
IT'S "ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT."

6
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:22,355
MICHAEL BLUTH HAD SCHEDULED 
A MEETING WITH STAN SITWELL,

7
00:00:22,355 --> 00:00:24,357
THE BLUTH COMPANY'S 
CHIEF COMPETITOR.

8
00:00:24,357 --> 00:00:26,276
- WHY ARE WE HAVING THIS MEETING 
AT HOME?

9
00:00:26,276 --> 00:00:28,569
- WELL, LET HIM SEE 
HE'S NOT THE ONLY ONE

10
00:00:28,569 --> 00:00:30,363
WHO BUILDS SOLID HOUSES, 
YOU KNOW?

11
00:00:32,698 --> 00:00:34,075
I THINK HE'LL BE 
PRETTY IMPRESSED,

12
00:00:34,075 --> 00:00:35,076
KNOCK ON WOOD.

13
00:00:35,076 --> 00:00:36,327
[knocking]

14
00:00:39,205 --> 00:00:41,207
narrator: IN FACT, 
MICHAEL WAS MEETING AT HOME

15
00:00:41,207 --> 00:00:43,334
AT THE BEHEST 
OF HIS FUGITIVE FATHER.

16
00:00:43,334 --> 00:00:44,335
- KNOCK ON WOOD.

17
00:00:44,335 --> 00:00:46,003
[knocking]

18
00:00:46,003 --> 00:00:47,672
- DON'T YOU FIND 
THE TIMING OF THIS MEETING

19
00:00:47,672 --> 00:00:48,673
A LITTLE SUSPICIOUS?

20
00:00:48,673 --> 00:00:51,551
RIGHT BEFORE WE PLAY 
HIS COMPANY IN SOFTBALL?

21
00:00:51,551 --> 00:00:53,386
- NO, NO, 
OUR BUSINESS IS IN TROUBLE,

22
00:00:53,386 --> 00:00:54,929
AND I THINK 
HE SEES AN OPPORTUNITY.

23
00:00:54,929 --> 00:00:56,931
SO, I FIGURED THE GUY'S 
A FAMILY MAN,

24
00:00:56,931 --> 00:00:58,058
WHY NOT INVITE HIM OVER,

25
00:00:58,058 --> 00:00:59,434
- LET HIM SEE US IN OUR ELEMENT.

26
00:00:59,434 --> 00:01:00,851
- I HOPE YOU DON'T MEAN 
THE WHOLE FAMILY...

27
00:01:00,851 --> 00:01:02,770
'CAUSE GEORGE MICHAEL'S 
OFF WITH ANN.

28
00:01:02,770 --> 00:01:03,813
- ANN?

29
00:01:03,813 --> 00:01:05,273
HMM. THAT'LL PLAY WELL 
WITH SITWELL.

30
00:01:05,273 --> 00:01:06,899
"WHERE'S YOUR SON?" 
"HE'S OUT WITH ANN."

31
00:01:06,899 --> 00:01:08,025
"WHO'S ANN?"

32
00:01:08,025 --> 00:01:10,027
"DON'T ASK ME, 
I'M JUST THE BOY'S FATHER."

33
00:01:10,027 --> 00:01:11,696
- HEY, SCREW SITWELL!

34
00:01:11,696 --> 00:01:14,074
HE COMES IN HERE TELLING US 
HOW TO BUILD OUR HOUSES,

35
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:15,658
HOW TO RAISE OUR KIDS.

36
00:01:15,658 --> 00:01:16,784
NO, WE KNOW WHAT WE'RE DOING.

37
00:01:16,784 --> 00:01:19,995
WE DON'T NEED 
ANY HELP FROM HIM.

38
00:01:19,995 --> 00:01:22,498
DAMN IT. 
THIS THING GOT PUSHED IN AGAIN.

39
00:01:22,498 --> 00:01:23,791
GONNA NEED A BUTTER KNIFE.

40
00:01:23,791 --> 00:01:25,084
- THIS IS WHAT 
I'M TALKING ABOUT.

41
00:01:25,084 --> 00:01:26,752
GEORGE MICHAEL'S GOT THESE 
POWERFUL LITTLE FINGERS.

42
00:01:26,752 --> 00:01:27,462
HE SHOULD BE HERE.

43
00:01:27,462 --> 00:01:28,588
- HEY, HOW DO YOU THINK I FEEL?

44
00:01:28,588 --> 00:01:30,215
HE'S THE ONE WHO SAID HE WOULD 
HELP ME ON THIS ESSAY

45
00:01:30,215 --> 00:01:32,091
FOR "THE OLD MAN AND THE SEA."

46
00:01:32,091 --> 00:01:33,468
- I'LL HELP YOU WITH THAT LATER.

47
00:01:33,468 --> 00:01:35,052
- OH, GREAT. 
OKAY.

48
00:01:35,052 --> 00:01:37,263
SO YOU HAVE TO READ THIS, 
AND THEN EXPLAIN IT,

49
00:01:37,263 --> 00:01:38,389
AND, THIS IS IMPORTANT,

50
00:01:38,389 --> 00:01:40,225
YOU HAVE TO SAY IT 
IN MY OWN WORDS, OKAY?

51
00:01:40,225 --> 00:01:41,392
SMART, BUT NOT TOO SMART.

52
00:01:41,392 --> 00:01:43,102
LET'S HAVE A FOUR-SYLLABLE MAX.

53
00:01:43,102 --> 00:01:45,104
- DO YOU WANNA SAY SOMETHING 
OR SHOULD I, TOBIAS?

54
00:01:45,104 --> 00:01:47,064
- NO, I BELIEVE IN 
LETTING CHILDREN

55
00:01:47,064 --> 00:01:49,066
LEARN FROM THEIR MISTAKES, 
MICHAEL.

56
00:01:49,066 --> 00:01:53,238
THEY MAKE A MISTAKE ONCE, 
THEY SHAN'T MAKE IT TWICE.

57
00:01:53,238 --> 00:01:56,116
OH, HERE I GO!

58
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:58,534
DON'T WORRY, IT HAS 
NOT FALLEN INTO THE GARAGE.

59
00:01:58,534 --> 00:01:59,744
KNOCK ON WOOD.

60
00:01:59,744 --> 00:02:03,248
[loud crash]

61
00:02:03,248 --> 00:02:04,665
- YOU GONNA WANT TO 
HELP ME WITH THAT?

62
00:02:04,665 --> 00:02:07,168
- NO, I CAN'T. 
I HAVE AN AUDITION TOMORROW.

63
00:02:07,168 --> 00:02:11,631
I'M UP FOR A MINOR, BUT MEATY, 
ROLE IN A FEATURE FILM.

64
00:02:11,631 --> 00:02:13,383
- "CONFIDENCE MAN TWO."

65
00:02:13,383 --> 00:02:14,384
- OH, YEAH?

66
00:02:14,384 --> 00:02:15,926
I DIDN'T SEE 
THE FIRST CONFIDENCE MAN.

67
00:02:15,926 --> 00:02:17,237
- NO, CONFIDENCE MAN TWO 
IS MY CHARACTER.

68
00:02:17,237 --> 00:02:21,682
I THINK I'LL DRIVE UP TODAY 
AND PLOT MY ROUTE TO THE STUDIO.

69
00:02:21,682 --> 00:02:22,725
- HOW 'BOUT I COME WITH YOU?

70
00:02:22,725 --> 00:02:24,018
I MEAN, I COULD 
HELP YOU PREPARE.

71
00:02:24,018 --> 00:02:25,520
- YES, WELL, 
IT'S FOR A CON MAN,

72
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,481
WHICH I DON'T THINK 
YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT.

73
00:02:28,481 --> 00:02:31,692
AND BESIDES, 
DON'T YOU HAVE SCHOOL?

74
00:02:31,692 --> 00:02:33,361
- NO, UM...

75
00:02:33,361 --> 00:02:36,239
TODAY IS "HELP YOUR DAD 
FOLLOW HIS DREAM" DAY.

76
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:39,825
- GREAT. 
WE CAN TAKE THE CARPOOL LANE.

77
00:02:39,825 --> 00:02:41,536
- I NEED ICE.

78
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:43,288
- I'M GLAD SITWELL'S 
COMING OVER.

79
00:02:43,288 --> 00:02:46,081
LET HIM SEE THAT 
WE'RE DOING FINE AS A FAMILY.

80
00:02:46,081 --> 00:02:48,293
THE ONLY HELP WE NEED 
IS FROM EACH OTHER.

81
00:02:48,293 --> 00:02:50,628
- AND APPARENTLY WHATEVER'S 
IN THAT BOTTLE.

82
00:02:50,628 --> 00:02:53,214
- THANKS FOR REMINDING ME. 
MY TEAMOCIL.

83
00:02:53,214 --> 00:02:54,257
- WAIT A MINUTE. 
TEAMOCIL?

84
00:02:54,257 --> 00:02:56,634
ISN'T THAT THAT SUPPLEMENT 
THAT YOU AND TOBIAS WERE HOCKING

85
00:02:56,634 --> 00:02:57,885
BEFORE THE F.D.A. SHUT YOU DOWN?

86
00:02:57,885 --> 00:03:00,471
narrator: IN THE MID '90s, 
TOBIAS FORMED A FOLK BAND

87
00:03:00,471 --> 00:03:02,056
TO PROMOTE A SUPPLEMENT

88
00:03:02,056 --> 00:03:04,183
THAT PROMISED BETTER UNITY 
AND TEAMWORK.

89
00:03:04,183 --> 00:03:06,018
- [singing] TEAMOCIL

90
00:03:06,018 --> 00:03:08,854
- TEAMOCIL MAY DECREASE 
YOUR SEX DRIVE.

91
00:03:08,854 --> 00:03:09,855
- [singing] TEAMOCIL

92
00:03:09,855 --> 00:03:11,274
- GOOD JOB, BUDDY. 
- THANKS, FRIEND.

93
00:03:11,274 --> 00:03:12,650
SINCE I'VE BEEN 
TAKING THIS AGAIN,

94
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:15,445
I'VE BEEN GETTING ALONG 
GREAT WITH MY HUSBAND.

95
00:03:15,445 --> 00:03:17,405
YOU'RE TAKING IT FOR 
THE SIDE EFFECT, AREN'T YOU?

96
00:03:17,405 --> 00:03:18,406
- MICHAEL! 
- OH, GOD.

97
00:03:18,406 --> 00:03:20,408
MOTHER, NOT A GOOD TIME. 
I'M HAVING A MEETING HERE.

98
00:03:20,408 --> 00:03:22,327
- LOOK AT WHAT BUSTER 
SENT FROM THE ARMY.

99
00:03:22,327 --> 00:03:23,328
- IT'S BLACKED OUT.

100
00:03:23,328 --> 00:03:25,580
- OH, THE GOVERNMENT. 
KEEP READING.

101
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:28,541
- "SERGEANT BLANK 
IS TREATING ME VERY BLANK,

102
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:30,376
"AND IT LOOKS LIKE 
I'LL BE SHIPPING OFF TO BLANK

103
00:03:30,376 --> 00:03:31,377
"IN ABOUT A BLANK.

104
00:03:31,377 --> 00:03:33,254
I BLANK YOU, MOTHER. 
BUSTER."

105
00:03:33,254 --> 00:03:34,380
- I'VE DONE EVERYTHING I CAN.

106
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:36,131
I EVEN TRIED TO CONVINCE THEM 
HE'S GAY,

107
00:03:36,131 --> 00:03:38,050
BUT NO ONE WOULD BELIEVE 
THAT A WOMAN LIKE ME

108
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:39,051
WOULD HAVE A GAY SON.

109
00:03:39,051 --> 00:03:40,177
- WELL, YOU CERTAINLY TRIED.

110
00:03:40,177 --> 00:03:42,179
YOU GUYS WORE MATCHING OUTFITS 
TILL HE WAS 12.

111
00:03:42,179 --> 00:03:43,806
narrator: 
EVEN ONCE ON A MAGAZINE COVER

112
00:03:43,806 --> 00:03:46,934
THAT HAD BEEN MOCKED 
WITHIN THE FAMILY FOR YEARS.

113
00:03:46,934 --> 00:03:48,811
LUCILLE, I-I'LL SAY IT AGAIN.

114
00:03:48,811 --> 00:03:51,606
YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT'S 
GOING TO HAPPEN IN THE ARMY.

115
00:03:51,606 --> 00:03:54,650
REMEMBER, LUCILLE?

116
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:56,527
- NO, I DON'T.

117
00:03:56,527 --> 00:03:57,695
- GET ME A VODKA, ROCKS.

118
00:03:57,695 --> 00:03:58,696
- MOM, IT'S BREAKFAST.

119
00:03:58,696 --> 00:04:00,030
- AND A PIECE OF TOAST.

120
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:01,782
- PLEASE, STAN SITWELL'S 
COMING OVER.

121
00:04:01,782 --> 00:04:03,909
- THAT HAIRLESS FREAK 
IS COMING HERE?

122
00:04:03,909 --> 00:04:05,703
NONE OF HIS HAIR IS REAL, 
YOU KNOW.

123
00:04:05,703 --> 00:04:07,121
- YOU MEAN THE GUY 
WE'RE MEETING WITH

124
00:04:07,121 --> 00:04:08,789
CAN'T EVEN GROW HIS OWN HAIR?

125
00:04:08,789 --> 00:04:09,915
COME ON!

126
00:04:09,915 --> 00:04:11,709
- IT'S CALLED ALOPECIA, 
AND I'D APPRECIATE IT

127
00:04:11,709 --> 00:04:13,419
IF WE COULD ALL BE 
SENSITIVE TO IT, OKAY?

128
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:15,921
HE HAPPENS TO BE A VERY MODEST 
AND GENEROUS MAN.

129
00:04:15,921 --> 00:04:17,131
- MODEST AND GENEROUS?

130
00:04:17,131 --> 00:04:18,299
- THEN WHY IS HE ALWAYS WAVING

131
00:04:18,299 --> 00:04:20,343
GIANT $10 MILLION CHECKS 
OVER HIS HEAD

132
00:04:20,343 --> 00:04:22,345
EVERY TIME SOME--

133
00:04:22,345 --> 00:04:23,929
- GO AHEAD, MOM. 
FINISH YOUR THOUGHT.

134
00:04:23,929 --> 00:04:27,141
"EVERY TIME SOME CHILDREN'S 
HOSPITAL NEEDS FUNDING"?

135
00:04:27,141 --> 00:04:30,561
- NONETHELESS, WE COULD GET 
A GIANT CHECKBOOK TOO.

136
00:04:30,561 --> 00:04:32,897
WE'RE JUST NOT 
THAT STARVED FOR ATTENTION.

137
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:37,067
narrator: AND LATER, 
SITWELL LAID OUT HIS PLANS.

138
00:04:37,067 --> 00:04:38,486
- SORRY THAT MY SON 
COULDN'T BE HERE.

139
00:04:38,486 --> 00:04:40,821
- LET ME GUESS. 
GIRLFRIEND.

140
00:04:40,821 --> 00:04:41,864
YOU KNOW, IT COULD BE WORSE.

141
00:04:41,864 --> 00:04:43,198
HE COULD WANNA MARRY 
YOUR MOTHER.

142
00:04:43,198 --> 00:04:45,285
[laughs]

143
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:47,620
OH, I'M SORRY, IS YOUR FAMILY 
NOT LAUGHING AT THAT YET?

144
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:49,330
OKAY, LET ME TELL YOU 
WHAT I'M OFFERING.

145
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:50,998
YOU GOT A WONDERFUL 
PIECE OF PROPERTY HERE

146
00:04:50,998 --> 00:04:52,041
THAT'S GOING NOWHERE.

147
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:53,334
SO WHAT I PROPOSE 
IS A CO-VENTURE

148
00:04:53,334 --> 00:04:54,794
WITH YOUR SUDDEN VALLEY 
DEVELOPMENT.

149
00:04:54,794 --> 00:04:57,380
THE FIRST THING YOU MIGHT WANNA 
CHANGE, THOUGH, IS THE NAME.

150
00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:00,466
YOU KNOW, SUDDEN VALLEY CONJURES 
UP THE IMAGE OF A SINKHOLE, NO?

151
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:03,553
- I TOLD THAT TO DAD. 
I TOLD THAT TO MY DAD.

152
00:05:03,553 --> 00:05:06,597
- I'M THINKING 
"PARADISE GARDENS."

153
00:05:06,597 --> 00:05:07,765
- [wind whistling]

154
00:05:07,765 --> 00:05:10,142
- I SWEAR TO GOD 
I HAVE THAT WRITTEN--

155
00:05:10,142 --> 00:05:12,102
I WANT YOU TO SEE THAT 
SO YOU DON'T THINK THAT I'M--

156
00:05:12,102 --> 00:05:13,688
I HAVE THAT WRITTEN DOWN 
ON MY NOTEBOOK.

157
00:05:13,688 --> 00:05:15,315
narrator: 
WHEN GEORGE SR. WAS IN CHARGE,

158
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:18,734
HE HAD A HABIT OF SHOOTING DOWN 
ANY IDEA MICHAEL CAME UP WITH.

159
00:05:18,734 --> 00:05:21,236
- AND SUDDEN VALLEY 
JUST SORT OF IMPLIES

160
00:05:21,236 --> 00:05:23,823
THAT SOMETHING AWFUL 
COULD HAPPEN ALL OF A SUDDEN.

161
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:25,199
YOU KNOW, PLUS, IT'S ON A HILL.

162
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:26,659
- WHAT, ARE YOU TAKING, 
STUPID PILLS?

163
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:27,660
COME ON.

164
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:29,370
SAVE US SOME MONEY.

165
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:30,996
narrator: THIS WAS 
A MANAGEMENT TOOL

166
00:05:30,996 --> 00:05:34,041
THAT HE USED TO KEEP MICHAEL 
WORKING FOR HIS APPROVAL.

167
00:05:34,041 --> 00:05:35,751
- THAT WAS A HARD ONE 
TO SAY NO TO.

168
00:05:35,751 --> 00:05:38,838
- THE ONLY THING I ASK IS, 
OUT OF THE 450 HOMES WE BUILD,

169
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:41,466
ONE BE GIVEN TO A DISADVANTAGED 
FAMILY FROM THE INNER CITY.

170
00:05:41,466 --> 00:05:42,467
- THAT'S GREAT.

171
00:05:42,467 --> 00:05:45,344
SO THE OTHER 449 FAMILIES 
LIVE IN FEAR?

172
00:05:45,344 --> 00:05:46,345
IS THAT WHAT WE'RE SAYING?

173
00:05:46,345 --> 00:05:48,097
I MEAN, COME ON! 
WHERE'S YOUR DECEN--

174
00:05:48,097 --> 00:05:50,641
WHAT THE HELL 
JUST FELL OFF YOUR FACE?

175
00:05:50,641 --> 00:05:52,977
ONE OF THIS GUY'S EYEBROWS JUST 
FELL IN THE BOWL CANDY BEANS.

176
00:05:52,977 --> 00:05:54,395
- I ALWAYS CARRY A SPARE.

177
00:05:54,395 --> 00:05:56,731
- WELL, I HOPE YOU ALSO CARRY 
A SPARE BOWL OF CANDY BEANS.

178
00:05:56,731 --> 00:05:57,773
- GOB!

179
00:05:57,773 --> 00:05:59,942
I'M VERY IMPRESSED 
WITH THE OFFER,

180
00:05:59,942 --> 00:06:01,110
AND I'M GONNA RUN IT UPSTAIRS,

181
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:02,445
SEE WHAT KIND OF REACTION 
IT GETS.

182
00:06:02,445 --> 00:06:05,239
- HMM? 
- SO TO SPEAK.

183
00:06:05,239 --> 00:06:07,658
narrator: MICHAEL HOPED 
TO IMPRESS HIS FATHER.

184
00:06:07,658 --> 00:06:09,034
- I THINK IT ALL SOUNDS 
PRETTY GOOD.

185
00:06:09,034 --> 00:06:10,244
PRETTY GOOD? 
IT WAS HORRIBLE.

186
00:06:10,244 --> 00:06:11,871
WHAT, ARE YOU TAKING, 
STUPID PILLS AGAIN?

187
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:15,124
narrator: BUT THEIR OLD DYNAMIC 
RETURNED WHEN GEORGE SR. DID.

188
00:06:15,124 --> 00:06:16,375
GOB WAS THE ONLY ONE DOWN THERE

189
00:06:16,375 --> 00:06:18,335
WHO KNEW HOW TO HANDLE 
THAT HAIRLESS FREAK.

190
00:06:18,335 --> 00:06:20,212
- THANK GOD WE HAVE GOB 
ON OUR TEAM.

191
00:06:20,212 --> 00:06:22,882
- YOU KNOW, DAD, GOB DOESN'T 
REALLY DO ALL THAT MUCH

192
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:24,049
FOR OUR TEAM.

193
00:06:24,049 --> 00:06:26,301
IN FACT, I THINK IT'S TIME 
THAT I GET PUT BACK IN CHARGE.

194
00:06:26,301 --> 00:06:27,470
- MICHAEL, LISTEN TO ME.

195
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:29,263
LATELY, YOUR IDEAS, 
THEY'RE HORRIBLE,

196
00:06:29,263 --> 00:06:32,683
AND SITWELL'S JUST TRYING TO 
FIGURE OUT OUR BATTING ORDER

197
00:06:32,683 --> 00:06:34,059
FOR THE SOFTBALL GAME 
ON SATURDAY,

198
00:06:34,059 --> 00:06:35,144
I'M TELLING YOU.

199
00:06:35,144 --> 00:06:36,437
- GOB SAID THE SAME THING, DAD,

200
00:06:36,437 --> 00:06:38,230
BUT I-I DOUBT THAT THIS GUY'S

201
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:41,233
TRYING TO DROP $15 MILLION 
TO FIND OUT OUR BATTING ORDER.

202
00:06:41,233 --> 00:06:43,569
- HEY, THIS GAME 
GOES WAY, WAY BACK.

203
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:45,488
narrator: 
IT WAS A FIERCE RIVALRY,

204
00:06:45,488 --> 00:06:48,949
WITH GEORGE SR. USING EVERYTHING 
AT HIS DISPOSAL TO WIN.

205
00:06:48,949 --> 00:06:50,993
- NO HAIR. 
HEY, WE GOT NO HAIR.

206
00:06:50,993 --> 00:06:52,870
narrator: WHILE STAN SITWELL 
USED THE GAME

207
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:55,498
TO RAISE FUNDS FOR 
UNDERPRIVILEGED CHILDREN.

208
00:06:55,498 --> 00:06:56,749
- OH, I THINK 
ONE OF YOUR ORPHANS

209
00:06:56,749 --> 00:06:58,959
IS HEADING TOWARDS THE STREET.

210
00:06:58,959 --> 00:07:00,210
STRIKE THREE.

211
00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:01,336
YOU GO DOWN THERE,

212
00:07:01,336 --> 00:07:03,005
AND YOU TELL HIM 
TO GO SCREW HIMSELF

213
00:07:03,005 --> 00:07:04,632
AND YOU APOLOGIZE 
TO YOUR BROTHER.

214
00:07:04,632 --> 00:07:07,217
WE NEED HIM ON OUR SIDE, 
AND WE NEED HIM HAPPY.

215
00:07:07,217 --> 00:07:08,218
- WHERE'S SITWELL?

216
00:07:08,218 --> 00:07:09,637
- SORRY, I TOLD HIM 
TO SCREW OFF.

217
00:07:09,637 --> 00:07:11,597
BUT GET THIS, 
HE OFFERED ME A JOB.

218
00:07:11,597 --> 00:07:12,890
- WHAT?

219
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:14,559
- WELL, I'M NOT WAITING 
ON MY BROTHER.

220
00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:15,726
I PASS.

221
00:07:15,726 --> 00:07:17,269
YOU LOOK SURPRISED.

222
00:07:17,269 --> 00:07:19,522
- I'M SORRY. 
I MUST'VE PUT IT ON TOO HIGH.

223
00:07:19,522 --> 00:07:21,106
BUT YOU WERE RIGHT.

224
00:07:21,106 --> 00:07:23,358
IT WAS A BAD OFFER, AND YOU WERE 
SMART ENOUGH NOT TO TAKE IT.

225
00:07:23,358 --> 00:07:24,902
YOU GOT GUMPTION. 
YOU SPEAK YOUR MIND.

226
00:07:24,902 --> 00:07:27,237
THAT MEANS YOU'RE GOOD ENOUGH 
TO WORK FOR ME.

227
00:07:27,237 --> 00:07:28,238
- [bleep] YOU.

228
00:07:28,238 --> 00:07:29,239
AND I ACCEPTED.

229
00:07:29,239 --> 00:07:30,866
HE'S WAITING FOR ME OUTSIDE.

230
00:07:30,866 --> 00:07:32,660
WE'RE GONNA SWING BY 
HIS WIGMAKER.

231
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:35,245
HIS "JUST WOKE UP" HAIR 
IS FINALLY READY.

232
00:07:35,245 --> 00:07:37,498
YOU'RE REALLY 
GONNA DO THIS?

233
00:07:37,498 --> 00:07:38,624
- IT'S READY, MIKE.

234
00:07:38,624 --> 00:07:42,127
THEY'RE ONLY GONNA HOLD IT 
FOR 24 HOURS.

235
00:07:42,127 --> 00:07:43,921
narrator: TOBIAS AND MAEBY, 
MEANWHILE,

236
00:07:43,921 --> 00:07:46,090
HAD MAPPED THE ROUTE 
TO THE AUDITION.

237
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:49,802
WELL, HERE WE ARE 
AND HOME WE GO,

238
00:07:49,802 --> 00:07:52,304
WITH PLENTY OF TIME 
TO GET YOU TO ENGLISH CLASS.

239
00:07:52,304 --> 00:07:53,347
- WAIT.

240
00:07:53,347 --> 00:07:55,307
YOU CAN'T DO A U-TURN 
ON YOUR DREAM.

241
00:07:55,307 --> 00:07:57,477
I SAY, WE GET YOU ON THE LOT

242
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:59,061
AND GET THE FUNKE NAME 
OUT THERE,

243
00:07:59,061 --> 00:08:00,896
START TALKING YOU UP 
AROUND THE WATER COOLERS.

244
00:08:00,896 --> 00:08:02,898
- OH, MAEBY, 
WE'LL NEVER GET ON HERE.

245
00:08:02,898 --> 00:08:06,569
I MEAN, BEHIND THESE WALLS ARE 
THE BIGGEST STARS IN THE WORLD,

246
00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:08,403
AMERICA'S TREASURES.

247
00:08:11,073 --> 00:08:12,407
- DAMN IT!

248
00:08:12,407 --> 00:08:15,536
- DAD, YOU'RE AUDITIONING FOR 
THE PART OF A CONFIDENCE MAN.

249
00:08:15,536 --> 00:08:17,371
LET'S TRY A LITTLE CONFIDENCE.

250
00:08:17,371 --> 00:08:18,581
- YOU SAY CONFIDENCE MAN?

251
00:08:18,581 --> 00:08:20,415
HEY, I'M UP FOR THAT PART TOO.

252
00:08:20,415 --> 00:08:22,502
- OH. 
- GOOD LUCK TO YOU.

253
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:23,919
- GOOD LUCK TO YOU TOO.

254
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:26,922
narrator: AS TOBIAS 
WAS GAINING SELF-CONFIDENCE,

255
00:08:26,922 --> 00:08:29,216
MICHAEL WAS STRUGGLING 
TO KEEP HIS.

256
00:08:29,216 --> 00:08:30,425
- WOW, YOU'RE PRESIDENT AGAIN?

257
00:08:30,425 --> 00:08:31,969
- YES, THIS IS THE WAY 
IT SHOULD BE.

258
00:08:31,969 --> 00:08:33,613
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF WHEN YOU 
HEAR THE WORDS, "SUDDEN VALLEY"?

259
00:08:33,613 --> 00:08:36,306
- SALAD DRESSING, I THINK.

260
00:08:36,306 --> 00:08:38,183
BUT FOR SOME REASON, 
I DON'T WANNA EAT IT.

261
00:08:38,183 --> 00:08:40,019
- RIGHT. 
BUT "PARADISE GARDENS."

262
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:41,353
- YEAH, OKAY.

263
00:08:41,353 --> 00:08:43,523
I CAN SEE MARINATING A CHICKEN 
IN THAT.

264
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:45,274
UM, I'M ACTUALLY HERE ABOUT 
THE SOFTBALL GAME.

265
00:08:45,274 --> 00:08:46,942
WE NEED SOME GIRLS ON THE TEAM, 
RIGHT?

266
00:08:46,942 --> 00:08:48,611
- YES, WE DO. 
THAT'S A LEAGUE REQUIREMENT.

267
00:08:48,611 --> 00:08:50,237
narrator: ONE THAT WAS DIFFICULT 
TO MEET,

268
00:08:50,237 --> 00:08:51,822
GIVEN GOB'S BEHAVIOR

269
00:08:51,822 --> 00:08:54,199
IN THE THIRD INNING 
OF LAST YEAR'S GAME.

270
00:08:54,199 --> 00:08:56,326
WE COULD JUST STAY OUT HERE 
AND WAIT FOR ANOTHER POP-UP.

271
00:08:56,326 --> 00:08:57,828
narrator: 
AND IN THE FIFTH INNING.

272
00:08:57,828 --> 00:08:59,163
- COME ON! 
YEAH, HERE WE GO!

273
00:08:59,163 --> 00:09:01,248
narrator: 
OH, AND BEFORE THE GAME.

274
00:09:01,248 --> 00:09:04,544
[all cheering]

275
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:07,337
- WE LOST OUR ENTIRE OUTFIELD 
AND A COUPLE OF COURT CASES.

276
00:09:07,337 --> 00:09:08,631
WELL, YOU KNOW 
WHO WOULD BE GREAT

277
00:09:08,631 --> 00:09:12,009
AND NOT AT ALL LITIGIOUS IS ANN.

278
00:09:12,009 --> 00:09:13,969
- MMM, NOT ANN. 
- NO?

279
00:09:13,969 --> 00:09:17,222
- 'CAUSE, YOU KNOW, THIS-- 
THIS GAME IS KIND OF OUR THING.

280
00:09:17,222 --> 00:09:18,808
- BUT ANN'S AMAZING.

281
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:20,225
YOU KNOW, SHE COULD PLAY 
MY POSITION.

282
00:09:20,225 --> 00:09:21,727
- YOU SHOULD BE PLAYING 
THE FIELD...

283
00:09:21,727 --> 00:09:23,646
THERE, IN RIGHT, 
YOU KNOW?

284
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:25,397
PLUS, I GOT AUNT LINDSAY 
PLAYING THIS YEAR.

285
00:09:25,397 --> 00:09:27,567
I CAN'T VERY WELL 
PULL HER OFF THE ROSTER.

286
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:29,735
LET'S MAKE ANN 
THE BACKUP, OKAY?

287
00:09:29,735 --> 00:09:32,154
VERY GOOD WAY 
TO THINK ABOUT HER, AS A BACKUP.

288
00:09:32,154 --> 00:09:34,156
- SHE'S GONNA BE SO EXCITED. 
- GOOD.

289
00:09:34,156 --> 00:09:36,200
- MAYBE--MAYBE NOW 
I'LL GET A KISS.

290
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,785
- OKAY.

291
00:09:37,785 --> 00:09:41,413
- OH.

292
00:09:41,413 --> 00:09:43,373
I MEANT FROM ANN.

293
00:09:43,373 --> 00:09:44,374
- YES, I KNOW.

294
00:09:44,374 --> 00:09:45,918
I JUST WANT TO 
GET IN THERE FIRST.

295
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:49,421
- OKAY.

296
00:09:51,674 --> 00:09:52,675
- LINDSAY, WAKE UP.

297
00:09:52,675 --> 00:09:54,468
I NEED YOU TO PLAY ON 
THE SOFTBALL TEAM THIS YEAR.

298
00:09:54,468 --> 00:09:57,597
narrator: LINDSAY FELT THE 
INTENDED EFFECT OF TEAMOCIL:

299
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:58,973
A SENSE OF CAMARADERIE.

300
00:09:58,973 --> 00:10:01,433
- COUNT ME IN, MICHAEL. 
HAPPY TO HELP THE TEAM.

301
00:10:04,729 --> 00:10:07,481
- GREAT NEWS. I'M BACK. 
- YOU JUST LEFT.

302
00:10:07,481 --> 00:10:09,817
- YEAH, I DON'T THINK THINGS 
ARE GONNA WORK OUT WITH SITWELL.

303
00:10:09,817 --> 00:10:11,443
I MEAN, WE PICKED UP 
HIS SLEEPY-HEAD WIG,

304
00:10:11,443 --> 00:10:12,444
EVERYTHING WAS COOL.

305
00:10:12,444 --> 00:10:13,487
NEXT THING I KNOW,

306
00:10:13,487 --> 00:10:15,447
HE'S ASKING ME 
FOR A BUNCH OF WORK IDEAS.

307
00:10:15,447 --> 00:10:17,532
SO, I THOUGHT I'D JUST QUIT

308
00:10:17,532 --> 00:10:19,451
AND GO BACK TO 
BEING PRESIDENT HERE.

309
00:10:19,451 --> 00:10:21,120
- I NEED TO DO THIS JOB, OKAY?

310
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,288
I NEED TO PROVE 
THAT I CAN DO THIS JOB.

311
00:10:23,288 --> 00:10:24,707
- TO WHO?

312
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:26,876
- TO...

313
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:28,669
YOU.

314
00:10:28,669 --> 00:10:30,129
- MICHAEL, I'M YOUR BIG BROTHER.

315
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:32,256
I'LL NEVER 
BE IMPRESSED WITH YOU.

316
00:10:32,256 --> 00:10:33,257
- STILL. 
- ANYWAY, LOOK.

317
00:10:33,257 --> 00:10:34,634
YOU CAN STILL DO IT.

318
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:38,053
I JUST WANT THE OFFICE 
AND MY STUFFS AND TITLE.

319
00:10:38,053 --> 00:10:40,640
- WHAT ABOUT...

320
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:44,268
IF I HELP YOU WITH YOUR WORK 
OVER AT SITWELL?

321
00:10:44,268 --> 00:10:46,854
- YOU'D DO THAT? 
- SURE.

322
00:10:46,854 --> 00:10:49,106
- YOU REALLY WANT ME 
TO SUCCEED AT SITWELL.

323
00:10:49,106 --> 00:10:50,274
- WELL, I JUST--

324
00:10:50,274 --> 00:10:51,275
HEY. 
COME ON.

325
00:10:51,275 --> 00:10:53,944
I REALLY WANT YOU TO BE 
OVER AT SITWELL.

326
00:11:00,034 --> 00:11:02,662
narrator: LUCILLE WAS WORRIED 
THAT HER SON BUSTER

327
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:04,705
WAS BEING SENT INTO BATTLE 
WITH THE ARMY.

328
00:11:04,705 --> 00:11:06,415
- I FEEL THAT WE'VE NOT 
BROUGHT SOMETHING UP

329
00:11:06,415 --> 00:11:08,417
THAT MIGHT BE A SOLUTION,

330
00:11:08,417 --> 00:11:10,961
UM, TO SPARE MY FEELINGS.

331
00:11:10,961 --> 00:11:12,337
- SEND YOU IN HIS PLACE?

332
00:11:12,337 --> 00:11:13,338
I CALLED.

333
00:11:13,338 --> 00:11:14,715
THEY DON'T WANT YOU BACK.

334
00:11:14,715 --> 00:11:16,801
narrator: OSCAR HAD SERVED 
IN VIETNAM

335
00:11:16,801 --> 00:11:18,803
AS A CROC SPOTTER 
ON A SWIFT BOAT.

336
00:11:18,803 --> 00:11:21,430
- CROC! 
NO, SORRY. WAIT. LOG.

337
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:23,640
JUST A LOG. 
NO, WAIT. SORRY. CROC!

338
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:27,061
- IT WAS THERE THAT HE MET 
A YOUNG U.S.O. DANCER

339
00:11:27,061 --> 00:11:28,145
NAMED LUCILLE.

340
00:11:28,145 --> 00:11:29,772
- I'D PREFER AN OLDER MAN.

341
00:11:29,772 --> 00:11:31,565
- HEY, I'M FREE AFTER THE SHOW.

342
00:11:31,565 --> 00:11:34,234
- I SAID OLDER, BOB, 
NOT DEAD.

343
00:11:36,403 --> 00:11:39,364
- I SWORE I'D NEVER 
SAY HIS NAME AGAIN, BUT...

344
00:11:39,364 --> 00:11:43,243
IT'S TIME TO CALL 
YOU-KNOW-WHO.

345
00:11:43,243 --> 00:11:45,245
narrator: "YOU-KNOW-WHO" 
WAS AN ARMY SERGEANT

346
00:11:45,245 --> 00:11:46,747
NAMED BILL ANDERSON.

347
00:11:46,747 --> 00:11:51,585
HE AND LUCILLE WERE AN ITEM 
BEFORE SHE LEFT HIM FOR OSCAR.

348
00:11:51,585 --> 00:11:55,130
AT THE STUDIO, 
TOBIAS BEGAN TO CREATE BUZZ

349
00:11:55,130 --> 00:11:56,381
AROUND THE WATER COOLER.

350
00:11:56,381 --> 00:11:58,633
THAT FUNKE IS SOME 
KIND OF SOMETHING.

351
00:11:58,633 --> 00:12:00,970
BOY, THIS FUNKE'S ALL ANYBODY'S 
EVER TALKING ABOUT.

352
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:02,429
I'M SO SICK AND TIRED 
OF HEARING ABOUT

353
00:12:02,429 --> 00:12:04,348
HOW BRILLIANT THAT FUNKE IS.

354
00:12:04,348 --> 00:12:05,599
OVERRATED.

355
00:12:05,599 --> 00:12:07,267
I'LL JUST MOVE-- 
I'M SORRY.

356
00:12:07,267 --> 00:12:08,602
I'M SORRY.

357
00:12:08,602 --> 00:12:10,187
OKAY. WE'RE OKAY.

358
00:12:10,187 --> 00:12:11,313
OKAY.

359
00:12:11,313 --> 00:12:12,898
narrator: MEANWHILE, 
MAEBY LOOKED FOR

360
00:12:12,898 --> 00:12:14,859
AN EMPTY OFFICE 
TO CALL GEORGE MICHAEL.

361
00:12:14,859 --> 00:12:15,860
WHERE ARE YOU?

362
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:16,861
I BOUGHT YOU A DAY.

363
00:12:16,861 --> 00:12:19,571
I CAN'T PUT THIS 
BOOK REPORT OFF FOREVER.

364
00:12:19,571 --> 00:12:21,406
- SORRY, IS THIS YOUR OFFICE?

365
00:12:21,406 --> 00:12:23,450
- NO, I'M JUST SITTING BEHIND 
SOMEONE ELSE'S DESK

366
00:12:23,450 --> 00:12:25,744
PRETENDING THESE ARE MY KIDS.

367
00:12:25,744 --> 00:12:27,704
CAN YOU GET JUDE LAW 
IN HERE FOR A MEETING?

368
00:12:27,704 --> 00:12:29,498
- OH, I'M JUST A READER.

369
00:12:29,498 --> 00:12:31,250
- A READER? 
- YEAH.

370
00:12:32,376 --> 00:12:34,253
- I NEED A REPORT BY TOMORROW.

371
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:36,588
BEFORE GYM-- 
LUNCH...

372
00:12:36,588 --> 00:12:37,840
WITH JIM...

373
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,091
CARREY.

374
00:12:39,091 --> 00:12:40,759
IT'S THE GRINCH GUY. 
YOU'RE TOO YOUNG.

375
00:12:45,055 --> 00:12:48,893
- SO GET THIS. 
SITWELL LOVED MY IDEAS.

376
00:12:48,893 --> 00:12:51,311
- WELL, MY IDEAS, 
AND I KNEW IT.

377
00:12:51,311 --> 00:12:52,312
THAT'S GREAT.

378
00:12:52,312 --> 00:12:54,148
YOU KNOW, DAD NEVER 
COMPLIMENTED ANY OF THOSE.

379
00:12:54,148 --> 00:12:55,149
- HERE'S THE THING.

380
00:12:55,149 --> 00:12:56,901
- I NEED MORE.

381
00:12:56,901 --> 00:12:58,819
- THERE WERE 34 PROPOSALS 
IN THERE.

382
00:12:58,819 --> 00:13:00,362
- YOU'D BE AMAZED 
HOW FAST THEY COME OUT

383
00:13:00,362 --> 00:13:01,571
WHEN YOU READ THEM ALL 
IN A ROW.

384
00:13:01,571 --> 00:13:03,740
- THIRTY-ONE, BAMBOO FLOOR 
UPGRADES.

385
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:04,783
CHEAPER, STRONGER."

386
00:13:04,783 --> 00:13:05,910
I CAN'T READ THIS WORD.

387
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:07,661
"THIRTY-TWO, 
WIRELESS CRAPABILITY."

388
00:13:07,661 --> 00:13:09,038
THAT ONE EXPLAINS ITSELF.

389
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:10,039
- "THIRTY-THREE,"

390
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:11,331
- GOB, THAT WAS 
SIX MONTHS' WORTH OF WORK.

391
00:13:11,331 --> 00:13:12,958
YOU CAN'T JUST BLURT THEM 
ALL OUT AT ONCE.

392
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:14,001
- MR. BLUTH. 
- HE'S COMING.

393
00:13:14,001 --> 00:13:15,585
I'VE GOT TO GO.

394
00:13:15,585 --> 00:13:17,922
- YOU BLEW THEM AWAY.

395
00:13:17,922 --> 00:13:18,923
BOUGHT YOU SOMETHING.

396
00:13:18,923 --> 00:13:20,883
MAYBE WE CAN 
PLAY CATCH SOMETIME.

397
00:13:20,883 --> 00:13:24,261
narrator: GOB'S OWN FATHER HAD 
ONLY ONCE PLAYED CATCH WITH HIM,

398
00:13:24,261 --> 00:13:27,806
AND IT ENDED AS BADLY 
AS ANY GAME OF CATCH COULD END.

399
00:13:27,806 --> 00:13:29,308
- WHITE POWER!

400
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:31,393
- BETTER YET, MAYBE WE CAN 
PLAY BALL ON SATURDAY.

401
00:13:31,393 --> 00:13:32,519
I'LL MEET YOU THERE.

402
00:13:32,519 --> 00:13:35,189
I'VE GOT A NECK HAIR FITTING 
AT 11:00.

403
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:38,275
narrator: GOB WAS BOTH ANGRY...

404
00:13:38,275 --> 00:13:39,568
AND OVERWHELMED

405
00:13:39,568 --> 00:13:42,446
BY THE APPROVAL 
FROM THIS NEW FATHER FIGURE.

406
00:13:43,488 --> 00:13:45,157
IT WAS CONFUSING.

407
00:13:46,158 --> 00:13:49,328
MICHAEL WAS LESS TORN 
AND WENT TO BRAG TO HIS FATHER.

408
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:51,330
- SO, APPARENTLY MY IDEAS 
AREN'T SO BAD,

409
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:53,832
AND THAT COMES FROM 
SITWELL HIMSELF.

410
00:13:53,832 --> 00:13:55,542
- YOU LET YOUR IDEAS 
GO TO SITWELL?

411
00:13:55,542 --> 00:13:56,543
- UH, NO.

412
00:13:56,543 --> 00:14:01,673
I GAVE THEM TO GOB, 
WHO, UH, WORKS THERE NOW.

413
00:14:01,673 --> 00:14:02,716
- YOU LET GOB 
GO TO SITWELL?

414
00:14:02,716 --> 00:14:04,969
WHAT'D I TELL YOU? 
I TOLD YOU--

415
00:14:04,969 --> 00:14:06,095
- "DON'T LET HIM GO." 
I KNOW.

416
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:06,946
BUT MY POINT IS THAT I DO 
ALL THE WORK, POP.

417
00:14:06,946 --> 00:14:09,181
- YEAH, AND HE MAKES 
ALL THE PLAYS.

418
00:14:09,181 --> 00:14:10,182
DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND?

419
00:14:10,182 --> 00:14:11,976
HE WAS THE BEST SOFTBALL PLAYER 
IN THE LEAGUE.

420
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:13,727
narrator: 
GOB WAS ESPECIALLY GIFTED

421
00:14:13,727 --> 00:14:16,563
AT SACRIFICING HIS BODY 
FOR THE PLAY.

422
00:14:16,563 --> 00:14:18,023
- PLAY'S AT SECOND. 
PLAY'S AT SECOND.

423
00:14:18,023 --> 00:14:19,816
YEAH! 
SUCK ON THAT, SITWELL.

424
00:14:19,816 --> 00:14:22,319
narrator: ALTHOUGH AT TIMES, 
EVEN THAT WASN'T ENOUGH.

425
00:14:22,319 --> 00:14:25,572
- YOUR TWEETY BIRD DANCE 
JUST COST US A RUN, YOU MORON.

426
00:14:26,115 --> 00:14:26,966
WHY DO YOU THINK 
SITWELL HIRED HIM?

427
00:14:26,966 --> 00:14:28,868
YOU CAN'T DO THIS.

428
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:29,910
YOU'RE GONNA LOSE THE GAME,

429
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:31,328
AND YOU'RE GONNA LOSE 
THE COMPANY--

430
00:14:31,328 --> 00:14:32,913
- THE GAME. 
COME ON, WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

431
00:14:32,913 --> 00:14:33,914
IF I WIN THE GAME,

432
00:14:33,914 --> 00:14:35,790
YOU'RE COMFORTABLE WITH ME 
RUNNING THE COMPANY?

433
00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:37,376
- YEAH, THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYING. 
- I'LL WIN THE GAME.

434
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:39,336
AND I'LL SHOW HIM THAT HIS 
LITTLE PLAN DIDN'T WORK,

435
00:14:39,336 --> 00:14:40,337
ALL RIGHT?

436
00:14:40,337 --> 00:14:41,671
WE CAN BUILD HOUSES. 
WE CAN WIN GAMES.

437
00:14:41,671 --> 00:14:43,883
- THAT IS WHAT I WANNA HEAR.

438
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:46,551
- [crashing sound]

439
00:14:46,551 --> 00:14:49,804
- WE CAN WIN GAMES.

440
00:14:49,804 --> 00:14:51,681
LINDSAY, DID THAT OVEN VENT 
HIT YOU?

441
00:14:51,681 --> 00:14:53,475
YOUR FOOT IS BLEEDING.

442
00:14:53,475 --> 00:14:54,977
- MY FOOT IS BLEEDING.

443
00:14:54,977 --> 00:14:57,229
narrator: TEAMOCIL MAY CAUSE 
NUMBNESS OF THE EXTREMITIES.

444
00:14:57,229 --> 00:14:58,605
- YOU'RE STILL GONNA BE ABLE 
TO PLAY

445
00:14:58,605 --> 00:14:59,856
ON OUR TEAM THIS WEEKEND, RIGHT?

446
00:14:59,856 --> 00:15:01,358
- WHY DO YOU THINK 
I'M TAKING TEAMOCIL?

447
00:15:01,358 --> 00:15:02,359
- TO CURB YOUR SEX DRIVE.

448
00:15:02,359 --> 00:15:04,653
- THAT'S RIGHT. 
WHAT TEAM ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

449
00:15:04,653 --> 00:15:08,365
narrator: IT MAY ALSO CAUSE 
SHORT-TERM MEMORY LOSS.

450
00:15:08,365 --> 00:15:09,699
- OKAY, LOOKS LIKE 
I'M GONNA NEED

451
00:15:09,699 --> 00:15:11,493
THAT FEMALE BACKUP PLAYER 
AFTER ALL.

452
00:15:11,493 --> 00:15:13,078
AND ANN'S REALLY GOOD 
AT SOFTBALL, HUH?

453
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:14,204
- YEAH. 
SHE'S AMAZING.

454
00:15:14,204 --> 00:15:15,622
YOU KNOW, SHE'S GOT 
THIS LOW CENTER OF GRAVITY.

455
00:15:15,622 --> 00:15:16,916
YOU CAN'T KNOCK HER OVER.

456
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:18,250
- WELL, I COULD KNOCK HER OVER.

457
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:19,584
- DAD, I'M TELLING YOU, 
YOU CAN'T.

458
00:15:19,584 --> 00:15:22,087
THEY CALL HER "THE WALL," 
YOU KNOW?

459
00:15:22,087 --> 00:15:23,088
WELL, THAT'S GREAT.

460
00:15:23,088 --> 00:15:24,506
BUT I COULD KNOCK HER OVER.

461
00:15:24,506 --> 00:15:26,300
I WON'T, BUT I COULD.

462
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:28,552
narrator: AND LUCILLE CALLED 
ON AN OLD LOVER.

463
00:15:28,552 --> 00:15:30,262
- WILLIAM? - 
YES, MA'AM?

464
00:15:30,262 --> 00:15:31,931
- YOU DON'T REMEMBER ME?

465
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:33,390
narrator: 
GENERAL ANDERSON HAD DONE

466
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:35,809
THREE TOURS OF DUTY IN VIETNAM,

467
00:15:35,809 --> 00:15:38,478
BUT THE ONLY MEMORY HE'D BLOCKED 
WAS BEING LEFT BY LUCILLE.

468
00:15:38,478 --> 00:15:41,731
- OH, GOD. 
THAT TOUCH.

469
00:15:41,731 --> 00:15:43,733
OH, HOW COULD I FORGET? 
PAT.

470
00:15:43,733 --> 00:15:44,901
- LUCILLE.

471
00:15:44,901 --> 00:15:46,946
- I COULD NEVER FORGET 
THAT TOUCH.

472
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:50,074
- BILL, THEY'RE SHIPPING 
MY SON BUSTER OFF.

473
00:15:50,074 --> 00:15:51,700
I CAN'T HAVE THAT HAPPEN.

474
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:53,618
- I'M SORRY. 
THERE'S NOTHING I CAN DO.

475
00:15:53,618 --> 00:15:56,080
- IS THERE ANYTHING I CAN DO?

476
00:15:57,247 --> 00:15:59,499
- MAYBE IF YOU...

477
00:15:59,499 --> 00:16:02,502
GO DOWNTOWN.

478
00:16:02,502 --> 00:16:08,925
- OH, I HAVEN'T DONE THAT 
IN 30 YEARS.

479
00:16:08,925 --> 00:16:12,262
[singing] WHEN YOU'RE ALONE 
AND LIFE IS MAKING YOU LONELY

480
00:16:12,262 --> 00:16:14,764
YOU CAN ALWAYS GO

481
00:16:14,764 --> 00:16:16,808
DOWNTOWN

482
00:16:16,808 --> 00:16:19,644
- YOU MAKE ME WANT TO 
PUKE, BLUTH!

483
00:16:19,644 --> 00:16:22,481
narrator: AND SO, BUSTER WAS 
PULLED OUT OF COMBAT TRAINING...

484
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:25,025
- PUT 'EM DOWN 
AND HALT!

485
00:16:25,025 --> 00:16:30,489
- AND PUT INTO 
U.S.O. TRAINING.

486
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:31,490
- IT JOLTS.

487
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:33,158
narrator: AND BACK AT 
GOB'S NEW OFFICE...

488
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:34,826
- IT'S NOT REALLY DOING IT 
RIGHT NOW, BUT--

489
00:16:34,826 --> 00:16:36,703
MICHAEL. 
- DO YOU STILL NEED THOSE IDEAS?

490
00:16:36,703 --> 00:16:38,080
- COME ON. 
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

491
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,373
I CAN'T LET SITWELL DOWN.

492
00:16:39,373 --> 00:16:41,458
I-I'M DESPERATE HERE.

493
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:42,667
- THEN I'LL 
MAKE YOU A DEAL.

494
00:16:42,667 --> 00:16:44,794
I WANT YOU TO 
THROW THE SOFTBALL GAME.

495
00:16:44,794 --> 00:16:46,255
- NEVER!

496
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:48,340
HE GAVE ME THIS.

497
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:50,717
- COURSE HE DID. 
WHY DO YOU THINK HE HIRED YOU?

498
00:16:50,717 --> 00:16:52,927
- HE LIKED MY IDEAS.

499
00:16:52,927 --> 00:16:54,971
- THEY WERE MY IDEAS, 
AND, NO, HE DIDN'T.

500
00:16:54,971 --> 00:16:56,515
HE JUST WANTS YOU 
FOR THE SOFTBALL GAME

501
00:16:56,515 --> 00:16:58,808
BECAUSE HE'S TRYING TO MAKE 
OUR FAMILY LOOK FOOLISH.

502
00:16:58,808 --> 00:17:02,354
- I KNEW YOU HAD BAD IDEAS.

503
00:17:02,354 --> 00:17:03,688
ALL RIGHT, WE'LL PLAY HIM.

504
00:17:03,688 --> 00:17:06,775
I'LL THROW THAT SOFTBALL GAME.

505
00:17:06,775 --> 00:17:09,736
NOBODY MAKES A FOOL OF 
OUR FAMILY WITHOUT MY HELP.

506
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:18,578
narrator: TOBIAS HAD TALKED UP 
THE NAME FUNKE,

507
00:17:18,578 --> 00:17:20,289
AND IT WAS TIME TO AUDITION.

508
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:21,790
- WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

509
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:23,208
- TOBIAS.

510
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:26,253
- HE'S TOO SHORT. 
GIVE IT TO THE GUARD.

511
00:17:26,253 --> 00:17:27,921
- OH. I-I'M NOT--

512
00:17:27,921 --> 00:17:29,798
I--ON CAMERA, 
I SEEM MUCH TALLER.

513
00:17:29,798 --> 00:17:32,134
narrator: AND MAEBY PICKED UP 
THE READER'S REPORT,

514
00:17:32,134 --> 00:17:34,678
WHICH HAD NOW BECOME 
HER BOOK REPORT.

515
00:17:34,678 --> 00:17:35,679
- WHATCHA GOT THERE?

516
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:36,721
- I CAN'T REALLY DISCUSS IT.

517
00:17:36,721 --> 00:17:38,057
- WELL, IF YOU 
WANNA GET IT MADE,

518
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:40,142
I'M THE GUY WHO HAS TO SEE IT.

519
00:17:40,142 --> 00:17:42,061
YOU'RE THE FUNKE 
EVERYONE'S TALKING ABOUT?

520
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:43,478
WHAT ARE YOU, LIKE, 15?

521
00:17:43,478 --> 00:17:45,397
- MARRY ME. 
[laughs]

522
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:47,232
- EVERYONE THINKS 
I LOOK YOUNG TOO.

523
00:17:47,232 --> 00:17:48,442
- SO WHO ARE YOU THINKING ABOUT?

524
00:17:48,442 --> 00:17:49,818
- JUDE LAW. 
WHY DO YOU ASK?

525
00:17:49,818 --> 00:17:50,819
- YEAH. 
GO YOUNG.

526
00:17:50,819 --> 00:17:52,904
YOUNG GUY AND THE SEA, 
BIG SPRING-BREAKER FOR US,

527
00:17:52,904 --> 00:17:54,448
CGI THE FISH.

528
00:17:54,448 --> 00:17:55,657
LET'S FAST-TRACK THIS ONE.

529
00:17:55,657 --> 00:17:57,326
narrator: AND THAT'S WHEN 
MAEBY REALIZED

530
00:17:57,326 --> 00:17:59,078
SHE HAD BECOME 
A SUCCESSFUL FILM EXECUTIVE.

531
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:00,454
- IT'S ALL WAXED UP.

532
00:18:00,454 --> 00:18:01,705
- ALL WAXED UP? 
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

533
00:18:01,705 --> 00:18:03,707
- I NEED SOMETHING. 
A JOB FOR MY DAD.

534
00:18:03,707 --> 00:18:05,292
- YEAH, YEAH. 
SURE. OKAY.

535
00:18:05,292 --> 00:18:08,378
- LISTEN TO ME. 
BRAND NEW CARS DON'T GET WAXED!

536
00:18:08,378 --> 00:18:11,047
narrator: 
THAT AFTERNOON IT WAS GAME TIME,

537
00:18:11,047 --> 00:18:16,553
AND MICHAEL FELT CONFIDENT 
ABOUT A BLUTH WIN.

538
00:18:16,553 --> 00:18:18,263
- SPIN, SPIN, SPIN.

539
00:18:18,263 --> 00:18:19,973
narrator: ANN WASN'T AS AMAZING

540
00:18:19,973 --> 00:18:24,228
AS GEORGE MICHAEL 
LED HIS FATHER TO BELIEVE.

541
00:18:24,228 --> 00:18:26,646
BUT GOB WAS PLAYING 
WORSE THAN EVER,

542
00:18:26,646 --> 00:18:28,482
AS PER HIS AGREEMENT 
WITH MICHAEL.

543
00:18:37,407 --> 00:18:40,785
- YOUR GUY CAN'T HIT, SITWELL. 
HE'S NEVER GONNA TOUCH IT.

544
00:18:40,785 --> 00:18:42,287
- TIME OUT. 
- TIME OUT.

545
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:43,580
- GOB, ARE YOU OKAY?

546
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:45,665
- YEAH, I JUST CAN'T HIT TODAY.

547
00:18:45,665 --> 00:18:47,292
GUESS YOU'RE REALLY 
DISAPPOINTED IN ME.

548
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:49,128
- HEY, EVERYBODY 
HAS DAYS LIKE THIS.

549
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:50,754
IT'S ONLY A GAME.

550
00:18:50,754 --> 00:18:52,256
AFTER THAT LIST OF IDEAS 
YOU GAVE ME,

551
00:18:52,256 --> 00:18:53,882
I DON'T CARE IF YOU BLOW 
THE WHOLE SEASON.

552
00:18:53,882 --> 00:18:55,842
COME HERE, YOU.

553
00:18:57,761 --> 00:19:00,180
OKAY. 
WE'RE GOOD.

554
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:04,100
narrator: AND GOB FINALLY FELT 
THAT SOMEONE BELIEVED IN HIM.

555
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:07,854
EVEN THOUGH 
THEY WEREN'T HIS IDEAS.

556
00:19:07,854 --> 00:19:10,440
AND HE DECIDED 
TO MAKE SITWELL PROUD.

557
00:19:13,402 --> 00:19:15,111
- GET ON THAT BALL!

558
00:19:18,031 --> 00:19:19,699
- YOU GO!

559
00:19:20,534 --> 00:19:22,118
- YOU BETTER PULL AN ANKLE 
OR SOMETHING.

560
00:19:22,118 --> 00:19:23,995
COME ON, GEORGE MICHAEL! 
GET THAT BALL IN THERE!

561
00:19:23,995 --> 00:19:26,415
narrator: THEN HE WENT 
HEADFIRST INTO THE WALL.

562
00:19:26,415 --> 00:19:28,500
- I'M SAFE. 
- YOU'RE OUT!

563
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:31,753
- OUT? I WAS SAFE! 
I'M SAFE!

564
00:19:31,753 --> 00:19:34,256
- STOP WITH THE TWEETY BIRD 
DANCE, YOU MORON.

565
00:19:34,256 --> 00:19:35,257
- DAD?

566
00:19:35,257 --> 00:19:36,466
- HE MADE THE CALL. 
YOU'RE OUT.

567
00:19:36,466 --> 00:19:37,467
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

568
00:19:37,467 --> 00:19:39,553
- SHUSH, SHUSH, SHUSH. 
- DAD?

569
00:19:39,553 --> 00:19:40,929
- HE'S SAFE.

570
00:19:40,929 --> 00:19:42,055
- WHAT THE HELL 
ARE YOU DOING HERE?

571
00:19:42,055 --> 00:19:43,890
- I'M TAKING CARE OF 
WHAT YOU SCREWED UP.

572
00:19:43,890 --> 00:19:45,475
YOU BLEW IT AGAIN, MICHAEL.

573
00:19:45,475 --> 00:19:46,518
- LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING.

574
00:19:46,518 --> 00:19:49,896
I BLEW IT WHEN I LET YOU 
START CONTROLLING ME AGAIN.

575
00:19:49,896 --> 00:19:52,191
I EVEN STOOPED TO CHEAT HERE 
AT A SOFTBALL GAME.

576
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:53,775
YOU TWO HAVE BEEN 
TALKING TO EACH OTHER.

577
00:19:53,775 --> 00:19:54,776
HOW COME NOBODY CALLED ME?

578
00:19:54,776 --> 00:19:55,819
- WHAT'S GOING ON THERE?

579
00:19:55,819 --> 00:19:57,862
- I'M JUST FIXING SOMETHING 
THAT'S BEEN BUGGING ME.

580
00:19:57,862 --> 00:20:00,532
HE WAS SAFE.

581
00:20:00,532 --> 00:20:04,203
HE WAS. WE LOST. 
GET OVER IT.

582
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:06,663
YEAH, AND STAN SITWELL 
LIKED MY IDEAS.

583
00:20:06,663 --> 00:20:07,914
HE REALLY BELIEVED IN ME.

584
00:20:07,914 --> 00:20:09,208
- MY IDEAS. 
- WELL.

585
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:13,002
- AND I'M PRESIDENT 
WHETHER YOU LIKE IT OR NOT, DAD.

586
00:20:13,002 --> 00:20:16,548
I DON'T NEED 
YOUR APPROVAL ANYMORE.

587
00:20:16,548 --> 00:20:19,301
- I'M PROUD OF YOU.

588
00:20:19,301 --> 00:20:21,094
- REALLY? 
- YEAH. SEE YA.

589
00:20:25,139 --> 00:20:27,684
- MICHAEL, I COULD'VE SWORN 
I JUST SAW DAD.

590
00:20:27,684 --> 00:20:28,685
OR NOT.

591
00:20:28,685 --> 00:20:31,187
I THINK HALLUCINATION IS ONE OF 
THE SIDE-EFFECTS OF TEAMOCIL.

592
00:20:31,187 --> 00:20:33,273
narrator: 
IT ISN'T.

593
00:20:33,273 --> 00:20:35,066
- THANKS FOR MAKING 
THE RIGHT CALL THERE, MIKE.

594
00:20:35,066 --> 00:20:36,067
- YEAH.

595
00:20:36,067 --> 00:20:37,486
- SORRY I DIDN'T BLOW THE GAME.

596
00:20:37,486 --> 00:20:39,028
- NO, YOU DID THE RIGHT THING,

597
00:20:39,028 --> 00:20:41,406
AND YOU FINALLY GOT DAD 
TO ONE OF YOUR BALL GAMES.

598
00:20:42,574 --> 00:20:45,910
- SCREW HIM. 
- YEAH.

599
00:20:45,910 --> 00:20:47,454
- I MISS HIM SO MUCH.

600
00:20:48,955 --> 00:20:51,165
narrator: ON THE NEXT 
"ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT."

601
00:20:51,165 --> 00:20:52,351
- MAEBY GETS HER FATHER A JOB.

602
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:54,253
- I GOT TO FIRE ONE OF YA.

603
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:55,295
- ANDY RICHTER!

604
00:20:55,295 --> 00:20:57,256
HERE ARE THOSE HEAD SHOTS 
I WAS TELLING YOU ABOUT.

605
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:58,257
- YEAH. 
I GOTTA GO.

606
00:20:58,257 --> 00:20:59,591
- IT'S TOBIAS FUNKE.

607
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:00,800
I TOLD YOU ABOUT THE HEAD SHOTS?

608
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:02,469
narrator: 
AND BUSTER VISITS THE GENERAL.

609
00:21:02,469 --> 00:21:04,095
- I JUST WANTED TO THANK YOU 
FOR MY NEW JOB.

610
00:21:04,095 --> 00:21:05,930
[laughs]

611
00:21:05,930 --> 00:21:08,517
WHAT'S WRONG? 
- I'M SHIPPING OUT TOMORROW.

612
00:21:08,517 --> 00:21:11,227
- OH, I'VE GOT JUST THE THING.

613
00:21:11,227 --> 00:21:15,357
- OH, I HAVEN'T FELT 
HANDS LIKE THAT IN YEARS.

614
00:21:15,357 --> 00:21:16,858
YOU ARE COMING TO THE FRONT.
