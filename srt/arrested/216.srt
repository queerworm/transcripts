00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:02,002
male narrator: 
NOW THE STORY

2
00:00:02,002 --> 00:00:04,129
OF A WEALTHY FAMILY 
WHO LOST EVERYTHING

3
00:00:04,129 --> 00:00:06,005
AND THE ONE SON 
WHO HAD NO CHOICE

4
00:00:06,005 --> 00:00:07,007
BUT TO KEEP THEM ALL TOGETHER.

5
00:00:13,429 --> 00:00:15,723
IT'S ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT.

6
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:20,520
narrator: 
MICHAEL CAME HOME

7
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:22,730
TO FIND HIS BROTHER-IN-LAW, 
TOBIAS,

8
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:25,024
WHO'D BEEN KICKED OUT OF 
THE HOUSE EARLIER THAT WEEK.

9
00:00:25,024 --> 00:00:27,152
- HOW ARE YOU?

10
00:00:27,152 --> 00:00:28,153
- I'M GOOD.

11
00:00:28,153 --> 00:00:29,987
DIDN'T I ALREADY SEE YOU TODAY?

12
00:00:29,987 --> 00:00:31,614
- NOT THAT I KNOW OF.

13
00:00:31,614 --> 00:00:33,908
narrator: MICHAEL HAD 
SEEN HIM EARLIER THAT DAY,

14
00:00:33,908 --> 00:00:37,078
AS TOBIAS HAD BEEN POSING 
AS AN ENGLISH NANNY,

15
00:00:37,078 --> 00:00:38,538
NAMED MRS. FEATHERBOTTOM.

16
00:00:38,538 --> 00:00:40,540
- WHO'D LIKE 
"A BANGER IN THE MOUTH"?

17
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:42,417
OH! RIGHT! I FORGOT.

18
00:00:42,417 --> 00:00:43,459
HERE IN THE STATES,

19
00:00:43,459 --> 00:00:45,920
YOU CALL IT 
"A SAUSAGE IN THE MOUTH."

20
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,004
- WE JUST CALL IT "SAUSAGE."

21
00:00:47,004 --> 00:00:49,549
narrator: THE FAMILY, OF COURSE, 
KNEW IT WAS TOBIAS,

22
00:00:49,549 --> 00:00:51,509
BUT THE HOUSE 
HAD NEVER BEEN CLEANER.

23
00:00:51,509 --> 00:00:52,802
- HELLO, YOUNG LADY.

24
00:00:52,802 --> 00:00:54,470
I HAVEN'T SEEN YOU IN A WEEK.

25
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:55,846
- OH. RIGHT.

26
00:00:55,846 --> 00:00:58,015
THAT MEANS MRS. FEATHERBOTTOM 
ISN'T HERE,

27
00:00:58,015 --> 00:01:00,726
WHICH MEANS 
SHE DIDN'T IRON MY BLOUSE,

28
00:01:00,726 --> 00:01:02,103
WHICH MEANS I DON'T HAVE 
ANYTHING TO WEAR

29
00:01:02,103 --> 00:01:03,604
FOR MY PREMIERE.

30
00:01:03,604 --> 00:01:07,192
THE PREMIER...OF CANADA.

31
00:01:07,192 --> 00:01:09,194
HE'S GOING OUT 
WITH MY GYM TEACHER.

32
00:01:09,194 --> 00:01:10,903
narrator: MAEBY WAS ACTUALLY 
REFERRING TO

33
00:01:10,903 --> 00:01:13,239
THE PREMIERE OF A FILM 
FROM THE STUDIO

34
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:15,450
WHERE SHE HAD CONNED HER WAY 
INTO A JOB

35
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:16,451
- OH, HEY. JACK.

36
00:01:16,451 --> 00:01:17,535
DID YOU EVER GET A CHANCE 
TO DO THAT COVERAGE ON

37
00:01:17,535 --> 00:01:19,745
"VOICES IN AMERICA: 
HISTORY AND PERSPECTIVE?"

38
00:01:19,745 --> 00:01:20,996
- YEAH, I LOOKED THAT UP.

39
00:01:20,996 --> 00:01:23,291
IT'S A NINTH-GRADE 
HISTORY TEXTBOOK.

40
00:01:23,291 --> 00:01:25,418
- YEAH, AND IF I DON'T 
GET YOUR REPORT ON IT,

41
00:01:25,418 --> 00:01:27,920
I WON'T BE ABLE TO PASS...

42
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,672
ON IT.

43
00:01:29,672 --> 00:01:31,549
BECAUSE I HAVE A FEELING 
IT'S A PIECE OF [bleep].

44
00:01:31,549 --> 00:01:33,259
narrator: 
UNFORTUNATELY, THE JOB

45
00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:35,010
WAS WREAKING HAVOC 
WITH HER LANGUAGE.

46
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:37,347
- MAYBE WE JUST NEED 
A NEW [bleep] HOUSEKEEPER.

47
00:01:37,347 --> 00:01:38,556
- OKAY.

48
00:01:38,556 --> 00:01:39,557
I'M SURE SHE WOULD HAVE 
IRONED IT FOR YOU

49
00:01:39,557 --> 00:01:40,558
HAD YOU TOLD HER ABOUT IT

50
00:01:40,558 --> 00:01:42,935
BEFORE SHE CHANGED OUT OF 
HER BLOODY WORK CLOTHES.

51
00:01:42,935 --> 00:01:48,316
BUT I AM OFF THEN.

52
00:01:48,316 --> 00:01:49,609
- WELL, I GOT 
TO KEEP HIM TRYING,

53
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:51,152
AND THAT IS THE JOB.

54
00:01:54,155 --> 00:01:55,865
- MICHAEL, 
WHAT ARE YOU DOING TOMORROW?

55
00:01:55,865 --> 00:01:57,492
- HAVING MY DAY RUINED

56
00:01:57,492 --> 00:01:59,119
WITH WHATEVER 
YOU'RE ABOUT TO ASK ME TO DO.

57
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:00,828
- IT'S MY WEDDING ANNIVERSARY.

58
00:02:00,828 --> 00:02:03,123
AND OSCAR WANTS 
TO THROW ME A PARTY.

59
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:05,458
- HE IS AWARE THAT HE'S NOT 
MARRIED TO YOU, RIGHT?

60
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:07,918
narrator: IN FACT, 
OSCAR HAD STARTED TO PERCEIVE

61
00:02:07,918 --> 00:02:09,795
THAT LUCILLE 
WAS PULLING AWAY FROM HIM.

62
00:02:09,795 --> 00:02:12,006
- NOT NOW. 
IT'S MY TIME OF THE MONTH.

63
00:02:12,006 --> 00:02:13,383
[inhales sharply]

64
00:02:13,383 --> 00:02:14,384
NOT NOW.

65
00:02:14,384 --> 00:02:15,968
I DON'T WANT TO RISK 
HAVING A BABY.

66
00:02:15,968 --> 00:02:17,762
IT COULD KILL ME.

67
00:02:17,762 --> 00:02:19,847
narrator: 
SO HE WENT TO BUSTER FOR ADVICE

68
00:02:19,847 --> 00:02:21,599
- I THINK SHE MISSES MY BROTHER.

69
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:22,850
- MY FATHER?

70
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:24,935
- YES? 
I MEAN, YES.

71
00:02:24,935 --> 00:02:26,896
MAYBE I SHOULD THROW HER 
AN ANNIVERSARY PARTY.

72
00:02:26,896 --> 00:02:27,247
- [gasps] 
OH!

73
00:02:27,247 --> 00:02:29,899
SO WHEN HE DOESN'T SHOW, 
SHE'LL REALIZE THAT

74
00:02:29,899 --> 00:02:31,609
YOU WERE THE ONE 
WHO WAS ALWAYS THERE FOR US.

75
00:02:31,609 --> 00:02:32,943
- WELL, I-I WAS THINKING

76
00:02:32,943 --> 00:02:34,820
ONE MORE PARTY 
AND THEN I'D MOVE OUT,

77
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:36,614
BUT--NO. 
I-I LIKE YOUR PLAN BETTER.

78
00:02:36,614 --> 00:02:37,990
THE ONLY PROBLEM IS

79
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:39,992
WE KNOW H-HE'S AROUND SOMEWHERE.

80
00:02:39,992 --> 00:02:42,162
- WELL, HE NEVER RETURNED 
WHEN I LOST MY HAND.

81
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:44,872
BUT YOU, 
YOU NOT ONLY EMBRACE IT,

82
00:02:44,872 --> 00:02:47,708
BUT I SAW YOU KISSING IT WHILE 
YOU THOUGHT I WAS SLEEPING.

83
00:02:47,708 --> 00:02:50,002
[giggles]

84
00:02:50,002 --> 00:02:51,546
[man singing] 
BAH-BAH-DAH-BAH

85
00:02:51,546 --> 00:02:52,922
MMM

86
00:02:52,922 --> 00:02:53,923
OKAY

87
00:02:53,923 --> 00:02:57,260
- WHO KNOWS WHAT GOES ON IN 
THAT POT-ADDLED MIND OF HIS.

88
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:58,803
ANYWAY, IT'S A PARTY,

89
00:02:58,803 --> 00:03:00,930
AND I WANT 
THE WHOLE FAMILY THERE.

90
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:01,931
- WE'RE HAVIN' A PARTY?

91
00:03:01,931 --> 00:03:03,766
- NO.

92
00:03:03,766 --> 00:03:05,643
WELL, I'M SORRY IF I DON'T WANT

93
00:03:05,643 --> 00:03:07,895
YOU DOING ONE OF 
YOUR STUPID PUPPET SHOWS.

94
00:03:07,895 --> 00:03:09,647
- I DID THAT ONCE, MOM.

95
00:03:09,647 --> 00:03:12,024
AND A LOT OF PEOPLE 
THOUGHT IT WAS PRETTY COOL.

96
00:03:12,024 --> 00:03:14,151
narrator: 
IN AN EFFORT TO HIP UP HIS ACT,

97
00:03:14,151 --> 00:03:16,404
GOB HAD BRIEFLY 
INTRODUCED A PUPPET.

98
00:03:16,404 --> 00:03:18,197
- CAN I TELL YOU 
SOMETHIN', MY MAN?

99
00:03:18,197 --> 00:03:19,407
SURE, FRANKLIN.

100
00:03:19,407 --> 00:03:23,703
YOU ARE ONE COOL [bleep].

101
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:25,204
SPEAKIN' OF MOTHERS,

102
00:03:25,204 --> 00:03:28,207
LET ME GIVE THAT OATMEAL 
SOME BROWN SUGAR.

103
00:03:28,207 --> 00:03:30,084
- GET OFF MY WIFE, YOU BASTARD!

104
00:03:30,084 --> 00:03:31,502
- OH, MAN. 
WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU?

105
00:03:31,502 --> 00:03:34,213
FRANKLIN SAID SOME THINGS WHITEY 
JUST WASN'T READY TO HEAR.

106
00:03:34,213 --> 00:03:35,298
- GOB, WEREN'T YOU ALSO

107
00:03:35,298 --> 00:03:38,301
MERCILESSLY BEATEN OUTSIDE OF 
A CLUB IN TORRANCE FOR THAT ACT?

108
00:03:38,301 --> 00:03:39,344
- HE ALSO SAID SOME THINGS

109
00:03:39,344 --> 00:03:41,429
THAT AFRICAN-AMERICANY 
WASN'T READY TO HEAR EITHER.

110
00:03:41,429 --> 00:03:43,764
- YOU KNOW, MOM, 
WE HAVE NO IDEA WHERE DAD IS.

111
00:03:43,764 --> 00:03:45,975
HOW'S HE GONNA 
HEAR ABOUT THE PARTY?

112
00:03:45,975 --> 00:03:48,561
- WHY DO YOU HAVE 
THE BABY MONITOR OUT?

113
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:51,522
- I'M, UH, LISTENING IN-- 
- SHE WANTS HER MAN BACK.

114
00:03:51,522 --> 00:03:52,982
- ON MY SON. 
- YO, MAN.

115
00:03:52,982 --> 00:03:55,150
YOU'RE GONNA GET YOUR 
SORRY WHITE ASS THROWN IN JAIL.

116
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:57,612
I SAID THAT'S ENOUGH.

117
00:03:57,403 --> 00:03:58,779
narrator: 
MICHAEL CAME UP

118
00:03:58,779 --> 00:04:01,699
WITH AN EXCUSE HE KNEW 
HIS MOTHER WOULD UNDERSTAND.

119
00:04:01,699 --> 00:04:03,784
- I'M LISTENING IN ON MY SON.

120
00:04:03,784 --> 00:04:06,454
I'M A LITTLE WORRIED 
ABOUT HIS GIRLFRIEND, ANN.

121
00:04:06,454 --> 00:04:07,455
- MY ADVICE,

122
00:04:07,455 --> 00:04:09,249
GET ONE OF THOSE TEDDY BEARS 
WITH THE CAMERAS IN THEM.

123
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:10,875
I HAD ONE IN BUSTER'S ROOM

124
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:13,878
TO MAKE SURE HE WASN'T GETTING 
TOO SERIOUS WITH ANYONE.

125
00:04:13,878 --> 00:04:15,255
AS IT TURNED OUT,

126
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:17,548
HE GOT TOO SERIOUS 
WITH THE TEDDY BEAR.

127
00:04:17,548 --> 00:04:21,594
I'LL SEE YOU 
AT THE ANNIVERSARY PARTY.

128
00:04:22,136 --> 00:04:23,554
- GANGY'S HAVING 
AN ANNIVERSARY PARTY?

129
00:04:23,554 --> 00:04:24,680
- SEEMS THAT WAY.

130
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:25,890
- HEY, IS FRANKLIN 
GONNA BE THERE?

131
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:28,100
- SEE THAT, MIKE? 
KIDS LOVE FRANKLIN.

132
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:29,685
- I JUST DON'T WANT HIM

133
00:04:29,101 --> 00:04:31,604
TO POINT OUT MY CRACKER ASS 
IN FRONT OF ANN.

134
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:33,273
- OH...

135
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:35,941
IMAGINE WHAT HE'D SAY 
ABOUT HER.

136
00:04:35,941 --> 00:04:39,069
- SO YOU WERE LISTENING IN 
ON GEORGE MICHAEL.

137
00:04:39,069 --> 00:04:41,238
CAN YOU BELIEVE WHAT HE ASKED ME 
THIS MORNING?

138
00:04:41,238 --> 00:04:42,615
- HEY, DO YOU THINK 
MY MOM'S ENGAGEMENT RING

139
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:43,616
IS STILL AROUND?

140
00:04:43,616 --> 00:04:44,784
- OF COURSE IT IS.

141
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:47,287
YOUR FATHER WOULD NEVER PART 
WITH SOMETHING SO PRECIOUS.

142
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:48,413
narrator: IN FACT, LINDSAY

143
00:04:48,413 --> 00:04:52,292
WAS CURRENTLY WEARING IT 
ON HER MIDDLE TOE, ROAST BEEF.

144
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:54,960
- YOU KNOW, I'M THINKING OF 
ASKING ANN TO GET PRE-ENGAGED.

145
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,379
-YOU ARE? 
- YEAH.

146
00:04:56,379 --> 00:04:58,005
WELL, I FEEL LIKE GOD MOVED HER 
HERE FROM OHIO

147
00:04:58,005 --> 00:04:59,465
JUST TO BE WITH ME.

148
00:04:59,465 --> 00:05:00,466
- HER?

149
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:02,385
- WELL, THAT'S THE FIRST 
I'VE HEARD OF THIS.

150
00:05:02,385 --> 00:05:03,636
- WELL, THEN WHO SAID, "HER?"

151
00:05:03,636 --> 00:05:05,596
- ME. THAT WAS-- 
THAT WAS ME.

152
00:05:05,596 --> 00:05:08,349
BUT, UM, HER?

153
00:05:08,349 --> 00:05:09,934
- LOOK, IT'S JUST 
A PRE-ENGAGEMENT.

154
00:05:09,934 --> 00:05:11,060
IT'S EXCITING.

155
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:12,895
YOU KNOW, 
IT'S YOUNG LOVE.

156
00:05:12,895 --> 00:05:16,231
I HAD IT ONCE. 
A MAN I LOVED.

157
00:05:16,441 --> 00:05:18,984
- HERE'S YOUNG MAEBY'S BLOUSE.

158
00:05:18,984 --> 00:05:21,111
- AND THEN THINGS 
TOOK A TURN SOMEHOW.

159
00:05:21,111 --> 00:05:22,196
- MASTER BLUTH.

160
00:05:22,196 --> 00:05:24,615
I HAVEN'T SEEN YOU 
IN A WEEK'S TIME.

161
00:05:24,615 --> 00:05:25,700
- OH, ACTUALLY,

162
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:28,160
YOU TRIED TO PUT A BANGER 
IN MY MOUTH THIS MORNING.

163
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:31,414
- OH, WAS IT THIS MORN-- 
WELL, I'M SORRY.

164
00:05:31,414 --> 00:05:33,207
I'M JUST SO EXHAUSTED.

165
00:05:33,207 --> 00:05:35,376
- SO I'M JUST GONNA 
TALK TO MY SON.

166
00:05:35,376 --> 00:05:37,002
I'M GONNA TELL HIM 
THAT I'M AGAINST THIS.

167
00:05:37,002 --> 00:05:38,588
I DON'T--I DON'T LIKE HER.

168
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:40,130
- YOU KNOW, 
MAYBE IF YOU STOP JUDGING HER,

169
00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:41,340
HE'D TRUST YOU.

170
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:43,551
LOOK, IF YOU SAY NO,

171
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:45,386
YOU'RE JUST GONNA 
DRIVE HIM RIGHT TO HER.

172
00:05:45,386 --> 00:05:48,263
- HEY, DAD. 
CAN YOU DRIVE ME TO ANN'S?

173
00:05:48,263 --> 00:05:50,349
N-N-N...

174
00:05:50,349 --> 00:05:51,517
Y-YES.

175
00:05:51,517 --> 00:05:54,645
- GREAT. I'LL WAIT IN THE CAR.

176
00:05:54,645 --> 00:05:56,522
- I DON'T THINK THAT WORKED.

177
00:05:56,522 --> 00:05:57,457
narrator: 
MEANWHILE, GOB WENT TO CHECK

178
00:05:57,457 --> 00:06:01,068
ON THE ONE FRIEND WHO 
DIDN'T MIND HAVING HIM AROUND.

179
00:06:01,068 --> 00:06:04,864
- GET YOUR LOSER HAND 
OUT OF MY ASS.

180
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:05,948
HELLO, SON.

181
00:06:05,948 --> 00:06:08,200
- OH, DAD. 
I THOUGHT--DAD?

182
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,243
THIS IS WHERE 
YOU'VE BEEN HI--

183
00:06:09,243 --> 00:06:10,244
MICHAEL.

184
00:06:10,244 --> 00:06:12,287
- I JUST CAME BACK 
BECAUSE OF YOUR MOTHER.

185
00:06:12,287 --> 00:06:14,665
SHE'S WITH MY BROTHER 
ON MY ANNIVERSARY.

186
00:06:14,665 --> 00:06:16,917
BUT I GOT AN IDEA 
FROM GEORGE MICHAEL.

187
00:06:16,917 --> 00:06:19,462
I NEED TO RECOMMIT MYSELF 
TO YOUR MOTHER.

188
00:06:19,462 --> 00:06:20,630
- HER?

189
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:22,089
- BUT YOU GOTTA 
GET ME INTO THAT PARTY.

190
00:06:22,089 --> 00:06:24,383
THEN YOU GOTTA 
TAKE ME TO THIS CHURCH.

191
00:06:24,383 --> 00:06:26,176
I FOUND THIS BROCHURE 
THAT ANN LEFT BEHIND.

192
00:06:26,176 --> 00:06:29,054
- WELL, THAT'S GONNA BE TOUGH. 
I'M NOT REALLY ALL THAT INVITED.

193
00:06:29,054 --> 00:06:31,932
- I GOT IT ALL WORKED OUT, 
BUT I NEED A LIMOUSINE.

194
00:06:31,932 --> 00:06:34,810
- I--I CAN DO THIS, DAD. 
I'M GONNA MAKE YOU PROUD.

195
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:37,522
- NEVER TOO LATE TO START.

196
00:06:37,522 --> 00:06:39,607
narrator: AND MICHAEL 
DROVE TO ANN'S HOUSE,

197
00:06:39,607 --> 00:06:41,609
WHERE HE FINALLY 
GOT TO MEET ANN'S PARENTS.

198
00:06:41,609 --> 00:06:44,403
- THIS IS MY FATHER, 
PASTOR TERRY VEAL.

199
00:06:44,403 --> 00:06:45,404
- HELLO.

200
00:06:45,404 --> 00:06:46,656
- OH, PASTOR.

201
00:06:46,656 --> 00:06:48,908
I-I DIDN'T KNOW. 
YOU DIDN'T TELL ME.

202
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:49,509
- I TOLD YOU. 
- I DIDN'T--NO, YOU DIDN'T.

203
00:06:49,509 --> 00:06:51,577
- PEOPLE TREAT YOU 
SO DIFFERENTLY

204
00:06:51,577 --> 00:06:53,162
WHEN THEY FIND OUT 
YOU'RE A MAN OF GOD.

205
00:06:53,162 --> 00:06:54,955
- OH, BELIEVE ME, I KNOW.

206
00:06:54,955 --> 00:06:56,874
- OH, ARE YOU A CHURCHGOING MAN?

207
00:06:56,874 --> 00:06:58,501
- I AM.

208
00:06:58,501 --> 00:07:01,754
SOMETIMES. YES. 
I DON'T GO RELIGIOUSLY.

209
00:07:01,754 --> 00:07:04,339
I MEAN, 
I'M NOT A NUT ABOUT IT.

210
00:07:04,339 --> 00:07:06,050
BECAUSE THERE IS 
NO SUCH THING AS A NUT

211
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:08,302
WHEN IT COMES TO RELIGION, 
PASTOR.

212
00:07:08,302 --> 00:07:09,428
- I'VE MET A FEW.

213
00:07:09,428 --> 00:07:12,682
- I'M SURE IF YOU'D LOOK 
A LITTLE BIT CLOSER,

214
00:07:12,682 --> 00:07:14,308
YOU'LL FIND 
SOME VERY EARNEST PEOPLE

215
00:07:14,308 --> 00:07:16,060
THAT ARE JUST 
DOING THEIR BEST.

216
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:17,186
- WHAT ARE YOU DOIN', DAD? 
- I'M NOT SURE.

217
00:07:17,186 --> 00:07:18,228
WHY DON'T YOU TWO KIDS RUN ALONG

218
00:07:18,228 --> 00:07:20,022
AND LET US GET TO KNOW EACH 
OTHER A BIT BETTER?

219
00:07:20,022 --> 00:07:21,023
THANK YOU.

220
00:07:21,023 --> 00:07:23,443
- MAYBE I SHOULD GET MY WIFE. 
HONEY.

221
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:24,777
- OKAY.

222
00:07:24,777 --> 00:07:26,153
- THIS IS GEORGE MICHAEL'S 
FATHER.

223
00:07:26,153 --> 00:07:27,447
- THIS IS YOUR WIFE.

224
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:29,449
DIDN'T--DIDN'T REALIZE 
YOU COULD REMARRY.

225
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:32,702
- WHAT? 
- IS THIS ANN'S MOTHER?

226
00:07:32,702 --> 00:07:34,954
- I'M MRS. VEAL. 
- I'M SORRY. I JUST--

227
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:37,498
I DID NOT EXPECT 
SOMEBODY SO YOUNG.

228
00:07:37,498 --> 00:07:40,501
- NEXT YOU'RE GONNA SAY 
HOW ANN AND I CAN BE SISTERS.

229
00:07:40,501 --> 00:07:42,628
- NO, I'D NEVER SAY THAT.

230
00:07:42,628 --> 00:07:45,172
LISTEN, I'M HERE BECAUSE 
I THINK THAT MY SON MIGHT BE

231
00:07:45,172 --> 00:07:47,467
PLANNING ON ASKING YOUR DAUGHTER 
TO GET PRE-ENGAGED.

232
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:49,569
- OH, MY GOSH. 
- OH, MY GOSH.

233
00:07:49,569 --> 00:07:52,763
WELL, THAT IS SOMETHING 
TO CELEBRATE.

234
00:07:52,763 --> 00:07:55,683
CAN WE OPEN UP 
SOME SPARKLING APPLE CIDER?

235
00:07:55,683 --> 00:07:56,684
- MM, NO.

236
00:07:56,684 --> 00:07:58,519
- OH, DID YOU WANT US TO 
GO DOWN TO THE LIQUOR STORE

237
00:07:58,519 --> 00:07:59,687
AND GET YOU SOME LIQUOR?

238
00:07:59,687 --> 00:08:00,688
- NO.

239
00:08:00,688 --> 00:08:02,189
DON'T YOU THINK 
THEY'RE A BIT TOO YOUNG?

240
00:08:02,189 --> 00:08:04,484
- OH, WE GOT SERIOUS 
AROUND HIS AGE.

241
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:06,360
WELL, WHO CAN BLAME YOU? 
YOU GOTTA LOCK THAT DOWN.

242
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,361
BUT I-I JUST--

243
00:08:07,361 --> 00:08:08,488
I'M NOT QUITE SURE 
THAT THEY'RE READY.

244
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:10,197
- MICHAEL, IN MY EXPERIENCE,

245
00:08:10,197 --> 00:08:12,282
THERE IS NO RECIPE 
FOR A PERFECT MATCH.

246
00:08:12,282 --> 00:08:14,535
IT TAKES 
THE LOVE OF TWO FAMILIES.

247
00:08:14,535 --> 00:08:16,245
- WELL, YOU HAVEN'T 
MET MY FAMILY.

248
00:08:16,245 --> 00:08:17,329
narrator: 
AND THAT'S WHEN MICHAEL

249
00:08:17,329 --> 00:08:20,332
DEVISED A NEW PLAN 
TO WIN THE VEALS' DISAPPROVAL.

250
00:08:20,332 --> 00:08:23,335
- YOU HAVEN'T MET MY FAMILY.

251
00:08:23,335 --> 00:08:25,462
YOU SHOULD MEET MY FAMILY.

252
00:08:25,462 --> 00:08:27,798
WE'RE GONNA BE HAVING 
AN ANNIVERSARY PARTY.

253
00:08:27,798 --> 00:08:29,967
- WHAT A WONDERFUL SURPRISE.

254
00:08:29,967 --> 00:08:33,012
WE WOULD LOVE TO WITNESS 
A CELEBRATION OF THEIR LOVE.

255
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:35,097
- THAT WOULD BE 
A WONDERFUL SURPRISE.

256
00:08:35,097 --> 00:08:37,349
narrator: BUT HE DID WANT 
A LITTLE BIT OF INSURANCE.

257
00:08:37,349 --> 00:08:38,809
- HEY, GOB.

258
00:08:38,809 --> 00:08:41,771
MOM WANTS FRANKLIN 
AT THE PARTY.

259
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:45,024
YEAH. WHAT? 
NO, NO, NO.

260
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:48,443
I DON'T WANT TO TALK-- 
HEY, FRANKLIN.

261
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:55,159
narrator: 
LUCILLE WAS SETTING UP

262
00:08:55,159 --> 00:08:56,410
FOR THE ANNIVERSARY PARTY

263
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:58,829
THAT SHE DIDN'T EXPECT 
HER HUSBAND TO ATTEND.

264
00:08:58,829 --> 00:08:59,830
- WHERE'S THE FOOD?

265
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:02,291
- SORRY. 
JUST STUFFING THE MUSHROOM.

266
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:04,919
- YOU REALIZE THAT'S TOBIAS, 
DON'T YOU?

267
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:07,547
- IF HE'S GONNA RAID MY CLOSET, 
HE'S GONNA WORK FOR IT.

268
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:08,756
- WHAT HAPPENED TO HIS ANKLE?

269
00:09:08,756 --> 00:09:10,591
narrator: 
TOBIAS HAD ATTEMPTED AN ENTRANCE

270
00:09:10,591 --> 00:09:13,093
THAT HE HOPED 
WOULD ENCHANT HIS DAUGHTER.

271
00:09:13,093 --> 00:09:14,637
- [singing in falsetto]

272
00:09:14,637 --> 00:09:18,307
[glass breaking] 
OHH!

273
00:09:18,307 --> 00:09:21,977
WE SHAN'T BE TELLING 
YOUR MOTHER THIS, SHAN'T WE?

274
00:09:21,977 --> 00:09:24,647
- MAYBE YOU CAN POINT OUT 
TO YOUR MOTHER

275
00:09:23,604 --> 00:09:27,149
THAT YOUR FATHER 
HASN'T ARRIVED YET.

276
00:09:27,107 --> 00:09:28,358
- HMM.

277
00:09:28,358 --> 00:09:29,484
SO...

278
00:09:29,484 --> 00:09:31,779
MY FATHER'S NOT HERE.

279
00:09:31,779 --> 00:09:35,199
- MAYBE HE IS.

280
00:09:37,534 --> 00:09:38,535
- ANN JUST CALLED.

281
00:09:38,535 --> 00:09:39,662
THEY HAD A PREDAWN MASS,

282
00:09:39,662 --> 00:09:41,163
AND THEN THEY'RE 
GONNA GO TO MASS, SO--

283
00:09:41,163 --> 00:09:44,249
- WELL, ANN'S GOT 
A GREAT DEAL OF MASS.

284
00:09:44,249 --> 00:09:46,501
ANYWAY, I HOPE 
THAT THE VEALS LIKE US.

285
00:09:46,501 --> 00:09:48,337
WHY DON'T YOU GO 
TOP OFF YOUR GANGY?

286
00:09:48,337 --> 00:09:49,338
THANKS.

287
00:09:49,338 --> 00:09:51,591
- WAIT A MINUTE. 
YOU INVITED THE VEALS?

288
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:53,843
- ONLY SO THAT 
THEY'LL DISAPPROVE OF US.

289
00:09:53,843 --> 00:09:55,595
I GOTTA KILL 
THIS PRE-ENGAGEMENT SOMEHOW.

290
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:57,346
AND AFTER MOM'S SECOND VODKA,

291
00:09:57,346 --> 00:09:58,931
AND AFTER BUSTER'S 
SECOND JUICE BOX,

292
00:09:58,931 --> 00:10:01,266
THEY'RE GONNA FORBID ANN 
FROM EVEN SEEING MY SON,

293
00:10:01,266 --> 00:10:03,978
MUCH LESS TAKING HIS RING, 
AND I'M STILL THE GOOD GUY.

294
00:10:03,978 --> 00:10:06,981
- SO THE DEVOUT 
RELIGIOUS FAMILY,

295
00:10:06,981 --> 00:10:08,482
THEY'RE THE BAD GUYS?

296
00:10:08,482 --> 00:10:10,525
- YOU'LL UNDERSTAND WHEN 
MAEBY STARTS GETTING PROPOSALS.

297
00:10:10,525 --> 00:10:13,320
narrator: ACTUALLY, 
MAEBY HAD GIVEN TWO THAT DAY.

298
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,321
- I'M SORRY.

299
00:10:14,321 --> 00:10:15,656
I CAN'T READ WHAT YOU WROTE 
ON THIS BUCK SLIP.

300
00:10:15,656 --> 00:10:17,992
YOU'VE GOT THE HANDWRITING 
OF A 15-YEAR-OLD.

301
00:10:17,992 --> 00:10:21,536
- 15-YEAR-OLD. 
MARRY ME!

302
00:10:22,412 --> 00:10:23,998
- HEY, I'M ALMOST DONE 
WITH THAT COVERAGE.

303
00:10:23,998 --> 00:10:25,332
I CAN BRING IT OUT 
TO YOU TONIGHT.

304
00:10:25,332 --> 00:10:27,084
ARE YOU STILL 
AT THE BALBOA TOWERS?

305
00:10:27,084 --> 00:10:29,419
narrator: MAEBY HAD USED 
HER GRANDMOTHER'S ADDRESS

306
00:10:29,419 --> 00:10:31,714
SO AS NOT TO AROUSE 
SUSPICION AT HOME.

307
00:10:31,714 --> 00:10:33,716
THIS REQUIRED 
CONVINCING THE GUARD

308
00:10:33,716 --> 00:10:36,260
SHE WAS SEVERAL YEARS YOUNGER 
THAN HER AGE.

309
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:38,638
- BOY, YOU GET A LOT OF MAIL 
FROM THAT MOVIE STUDIO.

310
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:41,223
- I WRITE A LOT OF LETTERS 
TO MOVIE STARS.

311
00:10:41,223 --> 00:10:42,599
- YOU SEEM A LITTLE OLD 
FOR THAT.

312
00:10:42,599 --> 00:10:44,268
- BABYSIT ME.

313
00:10:44,268 --> 00:10:46,646
- THAT PLACE 
SEEMS SO OLD FOR YOU.

314
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:48,605
- I'LL SEND DR. EPSTEIN 
YOUR COMPLIMENTS.

315
00:10:48,605 --> 00:10:50,315
AND MAY I ADD, MARRY ME.

316
00:10:50,315 --> 00:10:51,483
- OKAY.

317
00:10:51,483 --> 00:10:52,484
narrator: 
AND MAEBY REALIZED

318
00:10:52,484 --> 00:10:55,195
SHE MIGHT BE IN NEED 
OF A NEW DEFLECTION.

319
00:10:55,195 --> 00:10:57,782
- HI, MRS. VEAL. 
WELCOME.

320
00:10:57,782 --> 00:10:59,659
MOM, THIS IS ANN'S MOTHER.

321
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:01,661
- ARE YOU SURE 
THIS ISN'T HER SISTER?

322
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:03,078
- OH, WHAT A LOVELY 
THING TO SAY.

323
00:11:03,078 --> 00:11:05,205
- THAT'S AN AWFUL THING 
TO SAY, MOM. PLEASE.

324
00:11:05,205 --> 00:11:07,374
- I'M SO EAGER 
TO MEET YOUR HUSBAND.

325
00:11:07,374 --> 00:11:10,294
- YEAH. DAD ESCAPED FROM PRISON.

326
00:11:10,294 --> 00:11:10,770
DID YOU NOT KNOW THAT?

327
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:13,047
narrator: IN FACT, GEORGE SR.

328
00:11:13,047 --> 00:11:15,424
HAD JUST BEEN PICKED UP 
BY HIS SON.

329
00:11:15,424 --> 00:11:17,342
- OH, GREAT. IT'S STUCK. 
ALL RIGHT.

330
00:11:17,509 --> 00:11:19,136
JUST STAY DOWN 
AND LET ME HANDLE THIS.

331
00:11:20,637 --> 00:11:22,264
- IS THAT MR. BLUTH THERE?

332
00:11:22,264 --> 00:11:23,974
- HE'S GOT US, DAD. 
COME ON OUT.

333
00:11:23,974 --> 00:11:25,600
- HE'S TALKING TO YOU, 
YOU IDIOT.

334
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,436
COVER.

335
00:11:27,436 --> 00:11:29,146
- I AIN'T YOUR DADDY!

336
00:11:29,146 --> 00:11:32,357
HOW'S IT GOIN', BROTHER?

337
00:11:33,442 --> 00:11:35,027
- YOU WANT TO POP THE TRUNK

338
00:11:34,484 --> 00:11:35,694
AND ROLL THE WINDOWS DOWN, 
PLEASE?

339
00:11:40,532 --> 00:11:42,409
I'M JUST MESSIN' WITH YOU.

340
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:43,744
HEY, FRANKLIN. 
HOW YOU DOIN', LITTLE MAN?

341
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:49,124
- SO I'M AFRAID 
ANN'S WITH MY HUSBAND.

342
00:11:49,124 --> 00:11:51,626
HE HAD A LAST-MINUTE 
VOW RENEWAL AT THE CHAPEL.

343
00:11:51,626 --> 00:11:54,004
narrator: A CALL 
THAT WAS MADE BY GEORGE SR.

344
00:11:54,004 --> 00:11:55,714
- SO HOW DO WE GET HER 
TO THE CHURCH?

345
00:11:55,714 --> 00:11:57,424
TELL HER YOU'RE IN HERE OR-- 
OH. NO.

346
00:11:57,424 --> 00:11:59,676
COVER HER EYES 
AND TAKE HER TO THE LIMO.

347
00:11:59,676 --> 00:12:00,845
- NO. YOU BRING HER IN HERE,

348
00:12:00,845 --> 00:12:01,971
YOU KNOCK HER OUT 
WITH THIS ETHER,

349
00:12:01,971 --> 00:12:03,555
AND YOU STUFF HER INTO 
THIS GARMENT BAG.

350
00:12:03,555 --> 00:12:05,140
ANYONE SEES, YOU DO THE SAME.

351
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:07,476
OH, HI, TOBIAS.

352
00:12:07,476 --> 00:12:08,477
- OH.

353
00:12:08,477 --> 00:12:11,105
[singing] 
WHENEVER I GET A WEE BIT SCARED

354
00:12:11,105 --> 00:12:13,065
I HUM A LITTLE TUNE

355
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:14,942
HUM DIDDLE DIDDLY 
HUM DI-DO

356
00:12:14,942 --> 00:12:15,943
- YOU PUT A HANDKERCHIEF

357
00:12:15,943 --> 00:12:17,736
OVER HER MOUTH 
FOR A COUPLE OF SECONDS.

358
00:12:17,736 --> 00:12:19,738
NO MORE THAN TWO THOUGH, 
'CAUSE YOU COULD KILL HER.

359
00:12:19,738 --> 00:12:21,573
- I DON'T HAVE A HANDKERCHIEF. 
- FINE.

360
00:12:21,573 --> 00:12:23,533
PUT THE ETHER 
ON THE PUPPET'S LIPS.

361
00:12:23,533 --> 00:12:24,785
HAVE THE PUPPET KISS HER.

362
00:12:24,785 --> 00:12:26,996
- I AIN'T KISSIN' 
THAT OLD BITCH.

363
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:29,123
- THAT'S MY WIFE, YOU BASTARD!

364
00:12:29,123 --> 00:12:30,374
- DAD, THAT'S MY WRIST!

365
00:12:30,374 --> 00:12:33,853
[groaning] 
HEY, MAN! THAT'S HIS NECK!

366
00:12:33,853 --> 00:12:35,921
- HEY, GOB.

367
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:38,007
MRS. VEAL, 
THIS IS MY BROTHER GOB.

368
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:39,383
WHERE'S YOUR PAL FRANKLIN?

369
00:12:39,383 --> 00:12:40,467
- THROAT'S A LITTLE SORE.

370
00:12:40,467 --> 00:12:41,802
AND WRIST. 
[chuckles]

371
00:12:41,802 --> 00:12:43,178
NICE TO MEET YOU.

372
00:12:43,178 --> 00:12:45,347
- WHAT A LOVELY FAMILY.

373
00:12:45,347 --> 00:12:47,599
- DOES IT SEEM THAT WAY? 
WHERE'S BUSTER?

374
00:12:47,599 --> 00:12:49,393
[whispers] 
SHOULD HELP.

375
00:12:49,393 --> 00:12:51,020
- YOU KNOW, IT'S REALLY GREAT 
YOU DID THIS.

376
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:52,980
I THOUGHT 
YOU DIDN'T REALLY EVEN LIKE ANN.

377
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:54,231
BUT SINCE YOU DO,

378
00:12:54,231 --> 00:12:55,816
I THOUGHT MAYBE I COULD 
GET YOUR OPINION.

379
00:12:55,816 --> 00:12:58,152
I WAS THINKING OF GIVING HER, 
LIKE, A PRE-ENGAGEMENT--

380
00:12:58,152 --> 00:12:59,528
- RING? 
- YEAH.

381
00:12:59,528 --> 00:13:01,571
- WOW. THAT CATCHES ME 
OFF GUARD, GEORGE MICHAEL.

382
00:13:01,571 --> 00:13:03,073
I'M NOT SURE ABOUT THAT.

383
00:13:03,073 --> 00:13:05,700
I JUST--I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S--

384
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:08,078
I THINK--I THINK 
IT'S GONNA BACKFIRE ON YOU.

385
00:13:08,078 --> 00:13:09,538
I THINK THAT IT COULD 
BACKFIRE ON YOU,

386
00:13:09,538 --> 00:13:10,580
BECAUSE IT'S GONNA SEEM

387
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:13,542
LIKE YOU'RE TAKING MARRIAGE, 
UH, LIGHTLY, YOU KNOW.

388
00:13:13,542 --> 00:13:16,545
AND YOU CAN'T. 
IT'S VERY SACRED.

389
00:13:16,545 --> 00:13:19,089
- SACRED. 
- YEAH. THAT'S IT.

390
00:13:19,089 --> 00:13:21,091
- ALL RIGHT. 
WELL, YEAH.

391
00:13:21,091 --> 00:13:22,759
YOU KNOW, IT DID KIND OF 
FEEL RIGHT TO ME.

392
00:13:22,759 --> 00:13:24,845
BUT, YEAH. 
I'VE GOTTA TRUST YOU, RIGHT?

393
00:13:24,845 --> 00:13:26,055
- THANK YOU. THANK YOU.

394
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:28,933
- DAMN. MAYBE I SHOULD-- 
MAYBE I SHOULD ASK

395
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:31,518
IF SHE WANTS TO GET 
PRE-PRE-ENGAGED.

396
00:13:31,518 --> 00:13:33,103
ADD ANOTHER--

397
00:13:33,103 --> 00:13:34,855
- THE MERE FACT THAT YOU'RE 
LAUGHING ABOUT MARRIAGE

398
00:13:34,855 --> 00:13:36,273
MEANS THAT 
YOU'RE NOT READY, OKAY?

399
00:13:36,273 --> 00:13:37,524
- WHA--

400
00:13:37,524 --> 00:13:39,985
narrator: AND LUCILLE 
WAS ASKED TO THE KITCHEN.

401
00:13:39,985 --> 00:13:40,986
- WHAT'S SO IMPORTANT

402
00:13:40,986 --> 00:13:43,613
THAT YOU'RE DRAGGING ME AWAY 
FROM THIS MISERABLE PARTY?

403
00:13:43,613 --> 00:13:48,035
- WELL, I JUST HAD AN OLD FRIEND 
WHO WANTED TO TELL YOU...

404
00:13:48,035 --> 00:13:50,120
HOW MUCH I MISS YOU!

405
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:54,374
- OH, WHO LET THIS 
LITTLE BLACK [bleep]--

406
00:13:54,374 --> 00:13:56,126
- HEY, BROTHER.

407
00:13:56,126 --> 00:13:58,170
- WHO YOU CALLIN' BROTHER, 
YOU HOOK-ASS--

408
00:13:58,170 --> 00:13:59,171
- MOTHER!

409
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:01,381
[horn blows] 
[groaning]

410
00:14:02,507 --> 00:14:05,219
- WHAT THE HELL KIND OF PUPPET 
DOES BUSTER HAVE ON HIS HAND?

411
00:14:05,219 --> 00:14:06,678
- JUST LET ME THINK.

412
00:14:06,678 --> 00:14:09,264
GOD, FRANKLIN. 
YOUR BREATH--OH, GOD.

413
00:14:09,264 --> 00:14:11,683
- SO I'M REALLY GETTING EXCITED 
ABOUT YOUR PROPOSAL.

414
00:14:11,683 --> 00:14:13,268
- OH, YEAH. 
I'M NOT GONNA DO IT NOW.

415
00:14:13,268 --> 00:14:15,270
- BECAUSE ANN'S MOM 
DOESN'T APPROVE OF OUR FAMILY?

416
00:14:15,270 --> 00:14:16,396
OH, COME ON.

417
00:14:16,396 --> 00:14:18,899
IT'S JUST SOME STUPID PLAN 
YOUR FATHER WAS TRYING.

418
00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:20,943
- PLAN?

419
00:14:20,943 --> 00:14:21,944
WHAT PLAN?

420
00:14:21,944 --> 00:14:24,154
- WELL, IT'S OFF. SORRY.

421
00:14:24,154 --> 00:14:26,240
I KNOW THAT YOU WERE 
EXCITED ABOUT IT.

422
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:29,201
BUT, UH, YOU KNOW, 
IN THE SECULAR WORLD,

423
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:30,702
I FEEL LIKE 
THEY'RE A BIT YOUNG.

424
00:14:30,702 --> 00:14:32,955
- YOU KNOW, I--I DIDN'T 
WANT TO SAY ANYTHING

425
00:14:32,955 --> 00:14:35,707
IN FRONT OF TERRY, 
BUT I AGREE.

426
00:14:35,707 --> 00:14:36,708
I MEAN,

427
00:14:36,708 --> 00:14:38,668
PERHAPS THERE'S SOMEONE ELSE 
THEY'RE MEANT TO MEET.

428
00:14:38,668 --> 00:14:39,669
- WELL, LET'S--

429
00:14:39,669 --> 00:14:41,964
LET'S JUST SAY 
THAT IN THE SECULAR WORLD,

430
00:14:41,964 --> 00:14:43,423
ONE FINDS ONESELF

431
00:14:43,423 --> 00:14:45,134
WITH THEIR FAIR SHARE 
OF TEMPTATIONS.

432
00:14:45,134 --> 00:14:46,760
NOT THAT ANYONE WOULD EVER ACT--

433
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:49,471
[mumbling] 
MRS. VEAL.

434
00:14:49,471 --> 00:14:51,390
- TAKE ME. 
TAKE ME TO YOUR SECULAR WORLD.

435
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:53,600
- HEY. HEY, LISTEN.

436
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,684
- YOU KNOW WHAT? 
I CAN'T BELIEVE MY DAD.

437
00:14:54,684 --> 00:14:55,685
FIRST HE'S SAYING

438
00:14:55,685 --> 00:14:56,979
I NEED TO RESPECT 
THE SANCTITY OF MARRIAGE,

439
00:14:56,979 --> 00:14:58,730
AND THEN HE'S MAKING OUT 
WITH HER ON THE BALCONY.

440
00:14:58,730 --> 00:15:00,107
- I THOUGHT 
HE DIDN'T EVEN LIKE ANN.

441
00:15:00,107 --> 00:15:01,525
- NO, NO. MRS. VEAL.

442
00:15:01,525 --> 00:15:02,651
WELL, KNOW WHAT ELSE 
HE'S NOT GONNA LIKE?

443
00:15:02,651 --> 00:15:03,777
I'M GETTING PRE-ENGAGED.

444
00:15:03,777 --> 00:15:08,282
- GOD, THAT'S SO ROMANTIC. 
- THE HELL WITH HIM.

445
00:15:08,573 --> 00:15:09,741
- TAKE IT.

446
00:15:09,741 --> 00:15:11,994
TAKE THE SACRED RING.

447
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:14,163
NOT THE SNAKE. 
THAT DOESN'T COME OFF.

448
00:15:18,542 --> 00:15:20,210
narrator: 
MICHAEL HAD JUST BEEN KISSED

449
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:22,337
BY THE MOTHER 
OF HIS SON'S GIRLFRIEND.

450
00:15:22,337 --> 00:15:24,214
- OH, MY GOLLY! 
- LISTEN.

451
00:15:24,214 --> 00:15:25,507
DON'T DO THIS. DON'T DO THIS.

452
00:15:25,507 --> 00:15:27,717
- I CAN'T BELIEVE 
WE'RE MAKING LOVE.

453
00:15:27,717 --> 00:15:29,094
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? 
WE'RE NOT MAKING LOVE.

454
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:31,513
- I WANT 
TO PLEASE YOU SECULARLY.

455
00:15:31,513 --> 00:15:33,182
- WE'RE NOT GONNA DO THIS.

456
00:15:33,182 --> 00:15:35,392
- BUT YOU KEPT TELLING ME 
HOW BEAUTIFUL I WAS.

457
00:15:35,392 --> 00:15:38,062
- I WAS SURPRISED 
BECAUSE OF ANN.

458
00:15:38,062 --> 00:15:39,604
WELL-- 
- WHY BECAUSE OF ANN?

459
00:15:39,604 --> 00:15:42,857
- BECAUSE OF 
AN OLD WIVES' TALE.

460
00:15:42,857 --> 00:15:44,985
- OH, I'M SO ASHAMED. 
- ALL RIGHT. NO--

461
00:15:44,985 --> 00:15:47,029
MRS. VEAL.

462
00:15:47,029 --> 00:15:50,991
- JOLLY NEWS, GOVERNOR. 
YOUNG MASTER'S PROPOSING.

463
00:15:50,991 --> 00:15:52,034
- GEORGE MICHAEL?

464
00:15:52,034 --> 00:15:53,618
I TOLD HIM NOT TO. 
HE SAID HE WOULDN'T.

465
00:15:53,618 --> 00:15:54,911
- WELL, THIS WAS BEFORE

466
00:15:54,911 --> 00:15:58,665
HE SAW YOU POUNDING 
THAT SWEET PIECE OF VEAL.

467
00:15:58,665 --> 00:15:59,058
- HE SAW THAT? 
WHERE IS HE?

468
00:15:59,058 --> 00:16:02,169
- OH, HE LEFT 
WITH LADY LINDSAY--

469
00:16:02,169 --> 00:16:03,462
- TOBIAS, WHERE ARE THEY?

470
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:05,064
- IT IS ME. 
IT'S TOBIAS.

471
00:16:05,064 --> 00:16:08,092
- [yelling]

472
00:16:08,092 --> 00:16:09,134
WHAT HAPPENED? 
- WHAT'S GOING ON?

473
00:16:09,134 --> 00:16:12,596
- GOB MADE ME KISS FRANKLIN. 
AND I THINK MY FATHER WAS HERE.

474
00:16:12,596 --> 00:16:14,848
- MAYBE HE STILL IS.

475
00:16:14,848 --> 00:16:16,600
- OH, SHUT UP. 
WHAT DO YOU MEAN HE WAS HERE?

476
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:19,311
- I THINK HE WAS DRAGGING 
MY MOTHER OUT WITH GOB.

477
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:21,521
- OH, YOU SHUT UP. 
- WHAT'S GOIN' ON?

478
00:16:21,521 --> 00:16:22,772
- WE'RE TRYIN' 
TO FIGURE THAT OUT.

479
00:16:22,772 --> 00:16:24,274
APPARENTLY POP-POP 
KIDNAPPED GANGY,

480
00:16:24,274 --> 00:16:26,776
AND I HAVE NO IDEA WHERE 
GEORGE MICHAEL IS--OR LINDSAY.

481
00:16:26,776 --> 00:16:27,902
- I JUST SAW THEM DRIVE OFF.

482
00:16:27,902 --> 00:16:29,696
THEY'RE GONNA 
GO LOOK FOR BLAND.

483
00:16:29,696 --> 00:16:30,864
WHO'S THE HOTTIE?

484
00:16:30,864 --> 00:16:32,324
- THIS IS ANN'S MOTHER.

485
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:33,325
- HER?

486
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:36,203
DOES SHE LOOK OLD ENOUGH 
TO PLAY TOPHER GRACE'S MOM?

487
00:16:36,203 --> 00:16:38,538
- WHERE DID YOU SAY ANN WAS? 
- AT THE CHAPEL.

488
00:16:38,538 --> 00:16:39,873
- YEAH, WE GOTTA GET DOWN THERE.

489
00:16:39,873 --> 00:16:42,626
MY SON'S GONNA PRE-PROPOSE 
TO YOUR DAUGHTER.

490
00:16:42,626 --> 00:16:43,627
narrator: FORTUNATELY,

491
00:16:43,627 --> 00:16:46,421
TOBIAS HAD RENTED A CAR 
TO MAINTAIN HIS RUSE.

492
00:16:46,421 --> 00:16:48,507
- I HAD THIS SHIPPED OVER 
FROM "BLACKSTOOL."

493
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:51,551
IT'S WHAT I USED TO DRIVE 
THE ROGER MOORES ABOUT IN.

494
00:16:51,551 --> 00:16:53,928
narrator: AND LUCILLE AWOKE, 
HALF IN THE BAG.

495
00:16:53,928 --> 00:16:56,640
- WHAT AM I DOING 
IN A NORDSTROM BAG?

496
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:57,849
- IT'S ME.

497
00:16:57,849 --> 00:17:00,852
I'M TAKING YOU 
TO RENEW OUR VOWS.

498
00:17:00,852 --> 00:17:02,604
BUT FIRST-- 
- UH, DAD--

499
00:17:02,604 --> 00:17:03,647
- WE MAKE LOVE.

500
00:17:03,647 --> 00:17:05,774
- THE PARTITION DOESN'T 
GO ALL THE WAY UP, REMEMBER?

I WANT TO KNOW 
YOU WON'T RUN OUT ON ME AGAIN.

503
00:17:11,238 --> 00:17:13,990
I NEED TO KNOW 
YOU'RE IN IT FOR KEEPS.

504
00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:15,534

505
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:17,702

522
00:17:50,527 --> 00:17:53,172
"FIRST THE FLESH. 
I WILL CARESS AND TWEAK.

I HAVE SOMETHING TO ASK YOU.

529
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:09,879
WELL, I-I REALLY LIKE YOU.

00:18:23,935 --> 00:18:26,020
HE CAN DO IT 
AS SOON AS HE FINISHES.

538

539
00:18:27,189 --> 00:18:30,400

LAND A BLOW.

549
00:18:51,213 --> 00:18:53,215
- DAD, DO US. 
WE'RE READY TO GET MARRIED.

550
00:18:53,215 --> 00:18:55,592
- GEORGE MICHAEL, DON'T DO THIS 
JUST TO GET BACK AT ME, OKAY?

551
00:18:55,592 --> 00:18:57,051
WHAT YOU SAW ON THE BALCONY--

552
00:18:57,051 --> 00:18:59,471
UH, MRS. VEAL

555
00:19:04,768 --> 00:19:08,021
- YOU KISSED MY WIFE? 
- NO. SHE STARTED KISSING ME.

556
00:19:08,021 --> 00:19:09,523

WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?

561
00:19:19,324 --> 00:19:20,659
narrator: 
THE POLICE HAD BEEN DELAYED

562
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:22,661
WHEN THEY THOUGHT THEY'D 
CORNERED A KIDNAPPING SUSPECT.

563
00:19:22,661 --> 00:19:23,703
- PUT YOUR HANDS UP,

564
00:19:23,703 --> 00:19:26,331
OR WE'LL TAKE THAT AS A SIGN 
OF AGGRESSION AGAINST US.

565

PRETTY HOT IN HERE.

568
00:19:31,753 --> 00:19:35,424

- NO. SHE'S MINE.

569
00:19:35,424 --> 00:19:37,676
- OSCAR, I DON'T WANT HER. 
I DON'T WANT EITHER OF THEM.

570
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:39,928

WHERE'S MY BROTHER?

571
00:19:39,928 --> 00:19:41,930

574
00:19:49,271 --> 00:19:54,359

575
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:56,236
- TERRY, 
I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED.

576
00:19:56,236 --> 00:20:00,199
I FELL UNDER THE SPELL 
OF THAT HORRIBLE SECULAR FAMILY.

577
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:02,242
FORGIVE ME.

578
00:20:02,242 --> 00:20:03,993

HORRIBLE FAMILY STUFF

579
00:20:03,993 --> 00:20:05,704
ABOUT A HALF HOUR AGO.

580
00:20:05,704 --> 00:20:08,582
- I HOPE YOU NOTICE 
I DIDN'T RUN.

581
00:20:08,582 --> 00:20:09,749
- YOU FOUGHT FOR ME.

582
00:20:09,749 --> 00:20:12,461
- WHAT I MEANT TO SAY IS I-- 
I THINK I BROKE MY ANKLE.

583
00:20:12,461 --> 00:20:16,673

HOT AND COOL ON THAT.

584

585

- YEAH. THAT'S OKAY, DAD.

586
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:22,846
YOU KNOW, WE WERE-- 
WE WERE TALKING, AND WE THINK

587
00:20:22,846 --> 00:20:24,264
THAT WE WERE DOIN' IT 
FOR THE WRONG REASONS.

588
00:20:24,264 --> 00:20:26,391
- YEAH? WELL, YOU KNOW, 
YOU HAVE SO MUCH TO EXPERIENCE

589
00:20:26,391 --> 00:20:28,310
BEFORE YOU MAKE A COMMITMENT 
THAT YOU'RE NOT READY FOR.

590
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:29,311
YOU KNOW?

591
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:30,854
YOU JUST NEED TO GET 
TO KNOW EACH OTHER BETTER,

592
00:20:30,854 --> 00:20:33,648
AND THEN YOU CAN BE COMFORTABLE 
GOING ALL THE WAY WITH IT.

593
00:20:33,648 --> 00:20:34,983

594
00:20:34,983 --> 00:20:37,236
- YES. THIS TIME 
I'M BEING HONEST WITH YOU.

595
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:39,654
- THANKS, DAD. 
- OKAY.

596
00:20:41,155 --> 00:20:42,366
- IT SOUNDS LIKE YOUR FATHER

597
00:20:42,366 --> 00:20:45,034
JUST GAVE US PERMISSION 
TO START DOING IT.

598
00:20:45,034 --> 00:20:46,953
YOU MUST TEACH ME, 
GEORGE MICHAEL.

599
00:20:46,953 --> 00:20:49,414
YOU MUST TEACH ME 
THE WAYS OF THE SECULAR FLESH.

600
00:20:49,414 --> 00:20:51,791
[man singing] 
HEY, WHAT YOU TRYIN'

601
00:20:51,791 --> 00:20:54,419

ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT.

603
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:58,465

narrator: 
BUSTER FINDS SOMEONE ELSE

605
00:20:59,883 --> 00:21:01,760
INTERESTED IN KISSING HIS HOOK.

606
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:02,927
- OH, GOD!

607
00:21:02,927 --> 00:21:05,264

GET HIM, BENNETT!

608

narrator: SO BUSTER GETS 
A HOOK REPLACEMENT.

609
00:21:07,891 --> 00:21:10,435
- THEY'RE NOT GONNA LET YOU IN 
AT THE COUNTRY CLUB WITH THAT.

610
00:21:10,435 --> 00:21:13,187
- I DON'T WANT NO PART OF YOUR 
TIGHT-ASS COUNTRY CLUB,

611
00:21:13,187 --> 00:21:15,940
YOU FREAK BITCH!
