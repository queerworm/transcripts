00:00:10,302 --> 00:00:12,721
NARRATOR:<i> George Michael</i>
<i>was playing a game of lie tag</i>

2
00:00:12,763 --> 00:00:14,723
<i>-with his father.</i> 
-Wait, I bet we're sitting

3
00:00:14,765 --> 00:00:16,558
in the exact same traffic.

4
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:19,060
God, I just hope there are
no kids on that plane.

5
00:00:19,102 --> 00:00:20,688
500 bucks they find
a dead kid...

6
00:00:20,729 --> 00:00:23,064
<i>Currently each claimed</i>
<i>to be stuck in traffic</i>

7
00:00:23,106 --> 00:00:25,985
<i>behind a light aircraft</i>
<i>that had landed on the 605.</i>

8
00:00:26,025 --> 00:00:28,403
...loving that kid too much
and letting him fly the plane.

9
00:00:28,445 --> 00:00:30,030
And-and you know what?
One more thing.

10
00:00:30,071 --> 00:00:32,115
I think I accidentally had
the phone flipped around.

11
00:00:32,157 --> 00:00:34,869
I recorded my face
the whole time, you know?

12
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:36,453
Smartphone, stupid man.

13
00:00:36,495 --> 00:00:38,330
Pal, why don't you loop around
and film this thing.

14
00:00:38,372 --> 00:00:39,790
Someone's got to tell the story.

15
00:00:39,832 --> 00:00:42,041
<i>Michael hung up</i>
<i>feeling confident</i>

16
00:00:42,083 --> 00:00:43,544
<i>he'd had the last word.</i>

17
00:00:43,585 --> 00:00:46,005
-(phone chimes)
-Kidding me?

18
00:00:46,045 --> 00:00:47,756
GEORGE MICHAEL:
Missed you again, damn.

19
00:00:47,798 --> 00:00:49,758
But, you know,
I got out of my car here,

20
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,844
and I'm, uh, standing here now
with a paramedic

21
00:00:51,886 --> 00:00:53,094
named Tim Ridge... Ridgley...

22
00:00:53,136 --> 00:00:54,638
Can I record
some video over there?

23
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:56,390
-No cameras allowed.
-No camera...

24
00:00:56,431 --> 00:00:58,183
They're being real tight-assed
about this camera thing.

25
00:00:58,225 --> 00:00:59,894
<i>But George Michael was proving </i>
<i>more adept at lying</i>

26
00:00:59,935 --> 00:01:01,353
<i>than anyone suspected.</i>

27
00:01:01,395 --> 00:01:02,855
Getting back in my car now.

28
00:01:02,897 --> 00:01:04,565
You know, thank God
we weren't on that plane.

29
00:01:04,606 --> 00:01:07,026
<i>Which would come in handy</i>
<i>with a woman</i>

30
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:10,404
<i>who only knew him</i>
<i>as George Maharis.</i>

31
00:01:12,489 --> 00:01:13,532
-Hey.
-Hey.

32
00:01:13,574 --> 00:01:16,076
Hey, sorry, that was my dad.

33
00:01:16,117 --> 00:01:18,037
He can be kind of hard
to get off the phone sometimes.

34
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:20,080
(sighs) Tell me about it.
At least he wasn't drunk

35
00:01:20,121 --> 00:01:23,792
and bitching about Don Ameche
not knowing his lines in<i> Cocoon.</i>

36

He-He's actually great.

37
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:27,755
If anything, I've been
kind of a lousy son lately,

38
00:01:27,796 --> 00:01:29,965
but, you know, it's just--
I mean, at some point,

39
00:01:30,007 --> 00:01:31,759
I've got to start
living my life.

40
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:34,093
No, I know. I mean, my dad is
the nicest guy in the world,

41
00:01:34,135 --> 00:01:35,888
-but he just doesn't get it.
-(elevator bell dings)

-Yeah, no, once in a while.

Hey, George Michael.

91
00:03:21,493 --> 00:03:23,286
You stuck in traffic, pal?

92
00:03:23,328 --> 00:03:25,455

Hi, Rebel,
it's George Mi... haris.

104
00:03:54,776 --> 00:03:57,445
My night just freed up, and I
was wondering if you wanted...

105
00:03:57,487 --> 00:03:59,406
I thought you were
having dinner with your dad.

106
00:03:59,447 --> 00:04:02,159
Well, you know older guys--
the night ends for them at 8:00.

107
00:04:02,201 --> 00:04:04,411
I think I could use a break
from the old guys.

108
00:04:04,452 --> 00:04:06,163
And I've already got
some birth control in me

109
00:04:06,205 --> 00:04:07,414
that I paid for myself,

110
00:04:07,455 --> 00:04:09,541
and I'd hate
to let it go to waste.

111
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:11,126
Well, that's perfect,

112
00:04:11,168 --> 00:04:14,004
because I'm not quite ready
to have children.

113
00:04:15,422 --> 00:04:17,716
<i>So, as he straightened up</i>
<i>his room,</i>

114
00:04:17,758 --> 00:04:18,967
<i>-he got this call.</i> 
-(cell phone ringing)

115
00:04:19,009 --> 00:04:20,802
-Hey, Dad.
-George Michael, hey.

116
00:04:20,844 --> 00:04:22,137
Got out of it.

117
00:04:22,179 --> 00:04:24,514
I just-- I made a ton
of people angry,

118
00:04:24,556 --> 00:04:26,474
but you know what I always say:
family...

119
00:04:26,516 --> 00:04:29,477
Well, aw, gosh, you know,
I really wanted to, uh, do that,

120
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:32,313
but I just had
this work thing come up.

121
00:04:32,355 --> 00:04:33,815
And, uh, it's like
you always say:

122
00:04:33,857 --> 00:04:35,984
family first,
unless there's a work thing,

123
00:04:36,026 --> 00:04:37,986
and then work first.

124
00:04:38,028 --> 00:04:39,988
I have said that, too.

125
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:42,490
-Uh, so another time.
-Okay.

126
00:04:42,532 --> 00:04:45,160
<i>But he had another problem</i>
<i>he had to deal with.</i>

127

-Hey, George Michael.

128
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:48,830

-Look, I got us a peace pizza.

129
00:04:48,872 --> 00:04:50,040
Oh, that's great--
hey, you've got to go.

130
00:04:50,082 --> 00:04:51,583
What did you do with my stuff?

131
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:53,334
-I've just got a girl
coming over and... -Maeby?

132
00:04:53,376 --> 00:04:55,129
It's not Maeby, no.
But, um, could you please leave?

133
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:56,880
Okay, first you "F" me
with Fakeblock,

134
00:04:56,922 --> 00:04:58,506
and then you're gonna
kick me out

135
00:04:58,548 --> 00:05:00,008
when you have
a hottie coming over?

136
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:01,384
-I have roommate rights.
-Well, you know what?

137
00:05:01,426 --> 00:05:03,428
You voided your rights
when you took

138
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:05,097
this picture
of Maeby brushing her teeth.

139
00:05:05,139 --> 00:05:07,015
-Not against the rules.
-Still a little weird,

140
00:05:07,057 --> 00:05:08,183
-don't you think?
-But not against the rules.

141
00:05:08,225 --> 00:05:09,226
-Well...
-You know what?

142
00:05:09,268 --> 00:05:10,978
This is no longer a peace pizza.

143
00:05:11,019 --> 00:05:12,520
-That is a war pizza.
-Okay, that's fine.

144
00:05:12,562 --> 00:05:14,397
Do you want
to take it back or...?

145
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:16,775
No, I already ate.
Th-That's for you.

146
00:05:16,817 --> 00:05:18,359
-Oh, thank you.
-You're welcome.

147
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:20,154
Enjoy your war pizza!

00:05:25,909 --> 00:05:27,535
Oh, so this is a dorm.

151
00:05:27,577 --> 00:05:28,745
This is a dorm.

152
00:05:28,787 --> 00:05:31,915

anything goes in a dorm.

You got that right.

154
00:05:34,918 --> 00:05:37,296
Although, we should probably
go inside,

155
00:05:37,336 --> 00:05:38,672

Well, I aim to not please.
(chuckles)

164

00:06:09,536 --> 00:06:11,788
So, wait, is this where
you conceived Fakeblock?

169
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:13,915
<i>It was George Michael's</i>
<i>first chance</i>

170
00:06:13,957 --> 00:06:17,376
<i>to truly be unpretentious </i>
<i>and undo the big lie.</i>

171
00:06:17,418 --> 00:06:19,420
<i>On the other hand,</i>
<i>she thought</i>

172
00:06:19,462 --> 00:06:21,965
<i>he was an unpretentious</i>
<i>software genius.</i>

173
00:06:22,007 --> 00:06:26,136
<i>If she were to learn that he</i>
<i>was merely a wood block player</i>

174
00:06:26,178 --> 00:06:28,805
<i>with a heightened ability</i>
<i>to track the passage of time,</i>

175
00:06:28,847 --> 00:06:30,349
<i>perhaps she would rightly feel</i>

176
00:06:30,389 --> 00:06:33,185
<i>lack of pretention</i>
<i>should be a given.</i>

177
00:06:33,227 --> 00:06:37,356
<i>It was after second 23</i>
<i>that he said...</i>

178
00:06:37,438 --> 00:06:40,359
24. Yes, it was,
uh, right in here.

179
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:41,985
-Wow.
-Yeah.

180
00:06:42,027 --> 00:06:44,071
This is like making love
with the Wright brothers

181
00:06:44,112 --> 00:06:45,780
in their bicycle shop.

182
00:06:45,822 --> 00:06:47,699
<i>I'm sure she just meant</i>
<i>one of them.</i>

183
00:06:47,741 --> 00:06:49,784
<i>Hey, how about her knowing</i>
<i>they had a bicycle shop?</i>

184
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:51,536
Just a little token...

185
00:06:51,578 --> 00:06:53,955
<i>The next morning,</i>
<i>he walked her to her car.</i>

186
00:06:53,997 --> 00:06:57,251
(sighs) Listen, I got to go
shoot a PSA.

187
00:06:57,292 --> 00:06:58,668
I'll text you from the car.

188
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:00,587
Oh, no, don't-don't do...

189
00:07:00,628 --> 00:07:02,130
-Action.
-Tweet and drive.

190
00:07:02,172 --> 00:07:04,507
Yeah, that was good,
but it's "text."

191
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:06,260
And we need the word "don't."

192
00:07:06,301 --> 00:07:08,262
<i>And upon returning to his dorm,</i>

193
00:07:08,303 --> 00:07:11,806
<i>he discovered that P-Hound had</i>
<i>officially filed a grievance</i>

194
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:13,350
<i>with the student</i>
<i>housing office.</i>

195
00:07:13,392 --> 00:07:15,727
DOUG: So P-Hound claims
that George Michael...

196
00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:17,812
Make a note of that;
that's one person.

197
00:07:17,854 --> 00:07:18,897
Oh, I know, I know.

198
00:07:18,939 --> 00:07:20,481
...messed with his stuff

199
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:22,442
and stole some software thing?

200
00:07:22,483 --> 00:07:24,444
Yeah, and, uh,
George Michael claims

201
00:07:24,485 --> 00:07:26,321
that nobody can
live with P-Hound.

202
00:07:26,363 --> 00:07:28,115
Somebody's got to go.

203
00:07:28,156 --> 00:07:29,449
O-Okay, it's time for a vote.

204
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:31,118
We'll each get one vote.

205
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:32,994
Oh, well, that doesn't
really seem fair,

206
00:07:33,036 --> 00:07:34,788
because you guys are obviously
gonna vote for the same person.

207
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:37,374
Oh, right, yeah,
'cause, uh, we're twins,

208
00:07:37,416 --> 00:07:39,751
and, uh, we have no sense
of ourselves as individuals.

209
00:07:39,793 --> 00:07:40,752
That's right.

210
00:07:40,794 --> 00:07:41,920
BOTH:
Fine.

211
00:07:41,962 --> 00:07:43,797
We'll each get a half vote.

212
00:07:43,838 --> 00:07:45,882
<i>And the four men</i>
<i>cast their three votes.</i>

213
00:07:45,924 --> 00:07:47,717
DOUG:
It's a tie.

214
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:50,178
Uh, one and a half
to one and a half.

215
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:52,097
<i>The twins were proud</i>
<i>to show that they</i>

216
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:53,598
<i>voted differently</i>
<i>from one another.</i>

217
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:56,684
Eh, we're gonna need
a tiebreaker, ugly.

218
00:07:56,726 --> 00:07:58,853
<i>Fortunately, they were able</i>
<i>to bring in</i>

219
00:07:58,895 --> 00:08:00,314
<i>two more half voters...</i>

220
00:08:00,355 --> 00:08:02,441
-It's a tie. Two to two.
<i>-...who also proved</i>

221
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:04,192
<i>they were capable of having</i>
<i>opposite opinions.</i>

222
00:08:04,234 --> 00:08:05,902
Double tie!

223
00:08:05,944 --> 00:08:07,570
-Yeah! Whoo!
-Yeah! Whoo!

224
00:08:07,612 --> 00:08:09,614
<i>To break the tie,</i>
<i>more members of twin club</i>

225

226
00:08:10,949 --> 00:08:12,909
...a quadruple tie!

227

<i>...which also</i>

228
00:08:14,661 --> 00:08:17,038
-Yeah!
-Yeah! Go, yeah.

229
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:19,707
Maybe we should just bring in
a single person now.

230
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:22,585
Uh, you mean like n-not a twin?

231
00:08:22,627 --> 00:08:24,004
Yeah, just to speed things along
a little.

232
00:08:24,045 --> 00:08:25,755
<i>And perhaps it was</i>
<i>that comment...</i>

233
00:08:25,797 --> 00:08:27,424
I guess one head's better
than two, huh? Twin hater.

We've been dealing with
"twincists" like you

235
00:08:29,176 --> 00:08:31,386

236
00:08:31,428 --> 00:08:34,264

(bleep) What are you doing here?

257
00:09:14,137 --> 00:09:15,847
I was in the neighborhood.

258
00:09:15,889 --> 00:09:18,308
I happened to remember
how much you love bologna.

259
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:20,268
-Huh? -So, yeah, I just--
I found this great shop-rite

260
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:22,020
and I just thought,
you know who's got to have

261
00:09:22,062 --> 00:09:24,189
a taste of this,
is young George Michael.

262
00:09:24,231 --> 00:09:26,024
<i>He didn't think</i>
<i>George Michael liked bologna.</i>

263
00:09:26,066 --> 00:09:27,859
I know how you love bologna.

264
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:30,653
<i>He was trying to correct</i>
<i>a bad impression he felt</i>

We're good.

267
00:09:34,449 --> 00:09:36,076
My God, Uncle Gob, what is this?

268
00:09:36,117 --> 00:09:37,285
Can't lie to you,
George Michael,

269
00:09:37,327 --> 00:09:38,578
it's a forget-me-now.

270
00:09:38,619 --> 00:09:41,540
I wanted you to forget
what happened

271
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:44,042
at that magic club;
I was embarrassed.

272
00:09:44,084 --> 00:09:47,837
If you don't want me to tell
anyone about it, I won't.

273
00:09:47,879 --> 00:09:49,005
I'm such a fool.

274
00:09:49,047 --> 00:09:51,174
I go to those things
too quickly.

275
00:09:51,216 --> 00:09:53,009
Really, it's just the age
we live in, isn't it?

276
00:09:53,051 --> 00:09:55,512
Take a pill
to forget your problems.

277
00:09:55,554 --> 00:09:57,305
Take a pill to go to sleep.

278
00:09:57,347 --> 00:09:59,516
And take a pill
to forget your problems.

279
00:09:59,558 --> 00:10:01,101
Need an erection, take a pill.

280
00:10:01,142 --> 00:10:02,769
Need to forget your problems,
take a pill.

281
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:04,979
Take a pill
and your problems are forgotten.

282
00:10:05,021 --> 00:10:06,064
Just take a pill.

283
00:10:06,106 --> 00:10:07,190
What an age we live in.

284
00:10:07,232 --> 00:10:08,400
It's great, isn't it?
(laughs)

285
00:10:08,442 --> 00:10:10,944
What's with the suitcase?

286
00:10:10,985 --> 00:10:12,946
I got kicked out of my dorm.

287
00:10:12,987 --> 00:10:15,740
That was a freebie.

288
00:10:15,782 --> 00:10:17,367
You in the market
to buy a house?

289
00:10:17,409 --> 00:10:18,868
It's a great time to buy.

290
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:20,287
Oh, I don't want to buy a house.

291
00:10:20,328 --> 00:10:21,704
-I don't have
that kind of money. -Money?

292
00:10:21,746 --> 00:10:22,997
(chuckles):
Ninja please.

293
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:24,374
You don't need money.

294

Plus, it would
make your dad proud.

301
00:10:37,554 --> 00:10:40,140
I know that he's still
really disappointed about

302
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:41,516
you, uh...

303
00:10:41,558 --> 00:10:42,809
What, that I blew him off?

304
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:44,603
...blew him off.

305
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:46,646
Boy, is he disappointed
about that.

306
00:10:46,687 --> 00:10:47,897
I would love to say yes...

307
00:10:47,939 --> 00:10:48,856
Yes! There it is!

308
00:10:48,898 --> 00:10:51,025
I got my much vaunted yes!

309
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:52,360
<i>Gob felt good.</i>

310
00:10:52,402 --> 00:10:54,154
<i>He would be able to prove</i>

<i>to his brother that he could</i>
<i>actually sell a house.</i>

312
00:10:57,491 --> 00:10:59,742
<i>George Michael felt good</i>

314
00:11:02,162 --> 00:11:05,206

315
00:11:05,248 --> 00:11:07,917

Oh, this is...

336
00:11:46,789 --> 00:11:49,250
(chuckles)
I wonder who this is from.

337
00:11:49,292 --> 00:11:51,419
-We said no clothes, Carlos.
-Hat is not clothes.

338
00:11:51,461 --> 00:11:52,837
-A hat is clothes.
-Gosh, I wish

339
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:54,464
I had something
to offer you guys.

340
00:11:54,506 --> 00:11:56,049
You know, here you are,
guests in my home,

341
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:57,758
and you've gotten me
these beautiful gifts.

342
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:00,719
You know, feels like it
should be the other way around.

343
00:12:00,761 --> 00:12:02,096
(laughter)

344
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:03,557
MAN:<i> Football!</i>

345
00:12:03,598 --> 00:12:05,141
Hut, hut.

346
00:12:05,183 --> 00:12:06,476
-(Carlos laughs)
-Carlos...

347
00:12:06,518 --> 00:12:07,561
Carlos, you're on my team.

348
00:12:07,602 --> 00:12:08,853
You're on my team.

349
00:12:08,895 --> 00:12:10,689
The play is dead.
The play is dead.

350
00:12:10,771 --> 00:12:12,649
The ball touched the ground.

351
00:12:12,691 --> 00:12:14,484
Come on.
The play is dead.

352
00:12:14,526 --> 00:12:16,444
Carlos, man,
we're on the same team.

353
00:12:16,486 --> 00:12:18,821
Guys, maybe-maybe we can't play
skins versus skins.

354
00:12:18,863 --> 00:12:20,281
Tops versus bottoms?

355
00:12:20,323 --> 00:12:21,991
I got to bring
my girlfriend up here.

356
00:12:22,033 --> 00:12:23,493
-She's gonna love it.
-Let's throw her a party,

357
00:12:23,535 --> 00:12:25,620
Sudden Valley style.

358
00:12:27,247 --> 00:12:29,499
That actually sounds...
Yeah, fun.

359
00:12:29,541 --> 00:12:32,627
<i>And so George Michael</i>
<i>was proud to invite Rebel</i>

360
00:12:32,669 --> 00:12:36,673
<i>to see how successful</i>
<i>George Maharis had become</i>

361
00:12:36,715 --> 00:12:38,966
<i>and how many people were eager</i>
<i>to be in his company.</i>

362
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:41,886
No, I'm fine, I'm fine.
He was tickling me in there.

363
00:12:41,928 --> 00:12:44,264
-Hey, um, what-what is all this?
-Hey. Just a little surprise.

364
00:12:44,305 --> 00:12:45,682
-You did this for me? -Yes.
<i>-But Rebel had</i>

365
00:12:45,724 --> 00:12:47,684
<i>-other concerns.</i>
-We need to talk.

366
00:12:47,726 --> 00:12:50,645
ALL:
Ooh.

367
00:12:50,687 --> 00:12:51,854
This is it.

368
00:12:51,896 --> 00:12:53,523
This is the place.

369
00:12:53,565 --> 00:12:56,150
Hope you don't find it
too pretentious.

370
00:12:56,192 --> 00:12:59,571
Well, what happened to the old
anything goes in the dorm?

371
00:12:59,613 --> 00:13:00,863
Well, I got this place instead.

372
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:02,449
You know,
I guess I wanted to impress you.

373
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:04,409
I'm gonna get some furniture,
obviously.

374
00:13:04,451 --> 00:13:06,327
-Right. -The guys from home fill
are coming this week.

375
00:13:06,369 --> 00:13:07,786
That's not the problem.

376
00:13:07,828 --> 00:13:09,664
-No, that's not the problem.
-(door opens)

377
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:11,790
Wrong house, buddy.

378
00:13:11,832 --> 00:13:12,959
No, this is my son,

379
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,419
Lem Depardieu.

380
00:13:14,461 --> 00:13:15,920
-Hey, baby.
-Hi.

381
00:13:15,962 --> 00:13:17,422
Jacqueline still in the car?

382
00:13:17,464 --> 00:13:18,923
(exhales)
Oh, you have a son?

383
00:13:18,965 --> 00:13:20,550
Yeah.

384
00:13:20,592 --> 00:13:22,343
-Hey, Lem. How you doing?
-Hi.

385
00:13:22,385 --> 00:13:23,720
I love kids. I'm great...
You want a Twister?

386
00:13:23,762 --> 00:13:24,845
I was just given, like,
four Twisters.

387
00:13:24,887 --> 00:13:26,431
-You should take one.
-Wow.

388
00:13:26,473 --> 00:13:28,391
-Go on, take a Twister.
-Oh. You know what, honey?

389
00:13:28,433 --> 00:13:31,185
Do you want to give Mommy
some alone time with her friend?

390
00:13:31,227 --> 00:13:33,730
Maybe he could go play
in the pool.

391
00:13:33,772 --> 00:13:35,732
-Yeah. -He'll be totally safe.
There's like 100 guys out there.

392
00:13:35,774 --> 00:13:36,899
-Yay! -Make sure you wear
your sunblock.

393
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:38,276
<i>In fact, it was the folks</i>

394
00:13:38,318 --> 00:13:39,818
<i>in the pool</i>
<i>who were more at risk</i>

395
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:42,530
<i>of being near Lem</i>
<i>than he was of them.</i>

396
00:13:48,703 --> 00:13:50,747
<i>And perhaps that's what led Gob</i>

397
00:13:50,789 --> 00:13:53,374
<i>to having to take out</i>
<i>another ad.</i>

398
00:13:55,126 --> 00:13:56,586
GEORGE MICHAEL:
Wow, what a great kid.

399
00:13:56,628 --> 00:13:58,004
You know, when I said I was

400
00:13:58,045 --> 00:13:59,631
not eager to have kids,

401
00:13:59,673 --> 00:14:01,758
but I think it's great
that you have a son.

402
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,510
You know,
I have a spare room here

403
00:14:03,551 --> 00:14:04,927
that the two of you
could stay in.

404
00:14:04,969 --> 00:14:06,346
Or maybe you could
just stay in it.

405
00:14:06,387 --> 00:14:07,806
He doesn't live with me.

406
00:14:07,846 --> 00:14:09,808
He lives in France
with his father.

407
00:14:09,848 --> 00:14:12,435
He just visits March and April
during French pilot season,

408
00:14:12,477 --> 00:14:14,270
but that's what
I'm talking about.

409
00:14:14,312 --> 00:14:16,314
I just don't want to get
that serious.

410
00:14:16,356 --> 00:14:18,232
Because you're seeing
someone else?

411
00:14:18,274 --> 00:14:19,900
No. I mean, yes.

412
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:21,528
I'm seeing someone else,
but I don't want

413
00:14:21,569 --> 00:14:22,779
to get serious with him, either,

414
00:14:22,821 --> 00:14:24,364
and you're out telling people

415
00:14:24,405 --> 00:14:25,448
in the neighborhood

416
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:26,783
that we're seeing each other.

417
00:14:26,825 --> 00:14:27,867
What happened to the guy

418
00:14:27,908 --> 00:14:29,243
who founded Fakeblock?

419
00:14:29,285 --> 00:14:30,620
The guy who keeps
things anonymous?

420
00:14:30,662 --> 00:14:31,996
I can do anonymous.

421
00:14:32,038 --> 00:14:33,456
You know,
I'm all about staying anonymous.

422
00:14:33,498 --> 00:14:35,375
That's Fakeblock's
mission statement.

423
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:37,711
And then you're asking Lem
and me to move into this house,

424
00:14:37,752 --> 00:14:39,796
and it just,
it seems all backwards.

425
00:14:39,838 --> 00:14:41,255
(sighs)

426
00:14:41,297 --> 00:14:42,799
Sorry.

427
00:14:42,841 --> 00:14:44,843
(door closes)

428
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:46,969
Maybe it is backwards.

429
00:14:47,011 --> 00:14:49,806
<i>George Michael shared</i>
<i>his relationship problem</i>

430
00:14:49,848 --> 00:14:52,141
<i>with the one other woman</i>

431
00:14:52,183 --> 00:14:54,060
<i>he'd had</i>
<i>a relationship problem with.</i>

432
00:14:54,101 --> 00:14:55,687
GEORGE MICHAEL:<i> Well,</i>
<i>she's not really my girlfriend.</i>

433
00:14:55,729 --> 00:14:57,772
I mean, I'm crazy about her,

434
00:14:57,814 --> 00:14:59,649
but she wants
to keep things anonymous,

435
00:14:59,691 --> 00:15:01,609
-and I don't know how to do
that. -Oh, that's ridiculous.

436
00:15:01,651 --> 00:15:03,361
-Right. -You haven't told her
your real name yet, have you?

437
00:15:03,403 --> 00:15:04,779
What? No, no.

438
00:15:04,821 --> 00:15:06,656
No, she still thinks
I'm George Maharis,

439
00:15:06,698 --> 00:15:09,367
but she's dating another guy,
which is probably

440
00:15:09,409 --> 00:15:12,286
the whole reason she's always
saying I'm moving too fast.

441
00:15:12,328 --> 00:15:14,205
I take things too seriously.

442
00:15:14,247 --> 00:15:16,833
I take things too serious.

443
00:15:16,875 --> 00:15:18,209
I take things too seriously.

444
00:15:18,251 --> 00:15:19,544
I need to note which one
of those is correct,

445
00:15:19,586 --> 00:15:21,421
because I sound like
a horse's ass

446
00:15:21,462 --> 00:15:23,339
when I alternate
between the two of them.

447
00:15:23,381 --> 00:15:24,965
I need to get
my (bleep) together.

448
00:15:25,007 --> 00:15:27,176
-Yeah. -But the point is
that I take things

449
00:15:27,218 --> 00:15:29,679
easily-breezily.

450
00:15:29,721 --> 00:15:31,598
Well, a real "serioush" woman

451
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:34,267
knows what she wants
and moves quickly.

452
00:15:34,308 --> 00:15:36,477
"Serioush" is nothing.
That's not a word.

453
00:15:36,519 --> 00:15:37,937
Are you ready to see
your office?

454
00:15:37,978 --> 00:15:39,105
I have been; it's great.

455
00:15:39,146 --> 00:15:40,356
I like it a lot. It...

456
00:15:40,398 --> 00:15:42,316
I wonder if she's gonna think

457
00:15:42,358 --> 00:15:43,818
we've been a little lavish
with money.

458
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:45,111
You know, is it too much?

459
00:15:45,152 --> 00:15:46,153
But then to contradict myself,

460
00:15:46,195 --> 00:15:47,405
I do think at some point,

461
00:15:47,447 --> 00:15:49,240
it would be good to get
a second chair

462
00:15:49,282 --> 00:15:50,784
just in case we have a guest,
but I'm thinking big picture.

463
00:15:50,825 --> 00:15:51,992
<i>Of course,</i>
<i>that wasn't his office.</i>

464
00:15:52,034 --> 00:15:53,953
This isn't your office.

465
00:15:53,994 --> 00:15:55,705
She's over here.

466
00:15:55,747 --> 00:15:58,583
<i>And it was at his actual desk</i>

467
00:15:58,625 --> 00:16:01,294
<i>where he made his first</i>
<i>major decision as CEO.</i>

468
00:16:01,335 --> 00:16:04,839
-Maeby, you're fired!
-(tires screech)

469
00:16:04,881 --> 00:16:06,132
<i>And although Mort was prepared</i>

470
00:16:06,173 --> 00:16:08,050
<i>to be handed</i>
<i>his walking papers,</i>

471
00:16:08,092 --> 00:16:10,094
<i>there was nothing that could</i>
<i>have prepared George Michael</i>

472
00:16:10,136 --> 00:16:13,765
<i>for what Mort would</i>
<i>leave on his desk.</i>

473
00:16:13,807 --> 00:16:15,600
<i>And so, later that day,</i>
-Hey. -Hey.

474
00:16:15,642 --> 00:16:17,811
<i>it was a disgruntled Maeby that</i>
<i>ran into Michael</i> -Hey.

475
00:16:17,852 --> 00:16:20,354
<i>as he was seeking a signature</i>
<i>for his movie.</i>

476
00:16:20,396 --> 00:16:23,023
I think movies are dead.
Maybe it's a TV show.

477
00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:24,692
What? No. This girl
that I'm dating, Rebel,

478
00:16:24,734 --> 00:16:27,069
she's gonna be in it,
and she would never do TV.

479
00:16:27,111 --> 00:16:29,155
You're dating Rebel Alley?

480
00:16:29,196 --> 00:16:32,742
Yeah. I have a picture of us
to prove it; I can't find it,

481
00:16:32,784 --> 00:16:34,368
-but yeah.
-So...

482
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:35,703
you're the other guy.

483
00:16:35,745 --> 00:16:37,204
You know her personally?

484
00:16:37,246 --> 00:16:38,665
Yes. I mean,

485
00:16:38,706 --> 00:16:40,583
that's how I know
that you were dating her.

486
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:42,627
Do you know the other guy
that she's dating?

487
00:16:42,669 --> 00:16:45,296
<i>And that's when she saw</i>
<i>an opportunity</i>

488
00:16:45,338 --> 00:16:46,840
<i>to get back at George Michael.</i>

489
00:16:46,881 --> 00:16:48,842
No, no, but, um,

490
00:16:48,883 --> 00:16:50,134
I know it's over.

491
00:16:50,176 --> 00:16:51,469
She is dumping him.

492
00:16:51,511 --> 00:16:52,762
She dumping him?

493
00:16:52,804 --> 00:16:54,514
Apparently,
he was coming on too strong,

494
00:16:54,555 --> 00:16:56,140
taking it too seriously.

495
00:16:56,182 --> 00:16:57,350
She hates that.

496
00:16:57,391 --> 00:16:58,726
-Is that what she said?
-Yeah,

497
00:16:58,768 --> 00:16:59,853
that's what she told me.

498
00:16:59,894 --> 00:17:01,061
Just kills it for her.

499
00:17:01,103 --> 00:17:02,438
She wants it easily-breezily.

500
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:05,942
Well, that's... informative.

501
00:17:05,984 --> 00:17:07,861
I owe you. Thank you.

502
00:17:07,902 --> 00:17:09,069
No, you don't.

503
00:17:09,111 --> 00:17:10,488
Okay, wait,

504
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:12,072
wait, wait, wait, wait.
Don't knock, just...

505
00:17:12,114 --> 00:17:13,867
-Okay.
-One second.

506
00:17:13,908 --> 00:17:15,743
Mm-hmm.

507
00:17:17,912 --> 00:17:19,330
<i>And so fortified</i>

508
00:17:19,372 --> 00:17:21,499

<i>that Rebel</i>

509
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:23,376
<i>-was breaking up</i>
<i>with her other beau,</i> -Hello.

510
00:17:23,417 --> 00:17:24,711
-Michael.<i> -Michael decided</i>

511
00:17:24,752 --> 00:17:25,837
<i>-to move things along.</i>
-I want you

512
00:17:25,879 --> 00:17:27,254
to know that I think that

513
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:28,589
I've been coming on
a little bit too strong.

514
00:17:28,631 --> 00:17:29,883
I got a lot going on;
I got the movie.

515
00:17:29,924 --> 00:17:31,592
You know, a bunch of stuff

516
00:17:31,634 --> 00:17:33,469
with the housing complex,
and I'm just...

517
00:17:33,511 --> 00:17:34,721
I'm not gonna be
pressuring you anymore.

518
00:17:34,762 --> 00:17:36,556
I want to just keep it
easy-peasy.

519
00:17:36,597 --> 00:17:37,765
-Yeah.
-Cool, totally.

520
00:17:37,807 --> 00:17:39,308
-Keep it loose.
-Yeah.

521
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:41,019
And we'll have some fun with,
you know...

522
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:43,187
If the fun, you know...

523
00:17:43,229 --> 00:17:45,356
Someday, one day,
it gets more serious,

524
00:17:45,398 --> 00:17:47,859
you know, then, uh,
then it does,

525
00:17:47,901 --> 00:17:49,318
and we, uh,

526
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,905
we're walking down the aisle,
you know, and...

527
00:17:51,946 --> 00:17:53,990
I'm saying it wrong,
saying it wrong, 'cause I get,

528
00:17:54,032 --> 00:17:55,867
uh, I get tongue-tied, um...

529
00:17:55,909 --> 00:17:58,244
uh, because I think that you

530
00:17:58,285 --> 00:18:01,247
are coming on too strong.

531
00:18:01,288 --> 00:18:03,708
-You know? Bugging me.
-Oh, uh,

532
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:05,167
you want to come in?

533
00:18:05,209 --> 00:18:07,628
No.

534
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:10,506
-Ooh.
-Yeah? Yeah.

535
00:18:10,548 --> 00:18:12,967
<i>It was the best sex</i>
<i>Michael had ever had.</i>

536
00:18:13,009 --> 00:18:14,594
REBEL (sighs): That was great.

537
00:18:14,635 --> 00:18:16,637
Was that fun for you?

538
00:18:16,679 --> 00:18:17,764
No.

539
00:18:17,805 --> 00:18:18,973
(chuckles)

540
00:18:19,015 --> 00:18:20,767
Are you gonna take
a photo of me?

541
00:18:20,808 --> 00:18:22,894
Uh, no.

542
00:18:22,936 --> 00:18:25,646
No, no, I've been
trying to get a signal.

543
00:18:25,688 --> 00:18:27,523
<i>But he did want a picture</i>

<i>...and at an emotional impasse,</i>

562

563

<i>-And that's when Michael</i>
<i>ran into a son</i> -Dad, hey.

568
00:19:24,914 --> 00:19:27,207
George Michael,
what are you doing here?

569
00:19:27,249 --> 00:19:28,709
<i>...who was eager</i>
<i>to make him proud.</i>

570
00:19:28,751 --> 00:19:30,377
I-I'm home.

571
00:19:31,796 --> 00:19:33,881
<i>But George Michael had</i>
<i>suddenly found himself</i>

572
00:19:33,923 --> 00:19:35,591
<i>-with enormous debt</i>
-You bought this house?

573
00:19:35,633 --> 00:19:38,511
<i>-and tried to hide his panic.</i>
-Why would you buy

574
00:19:38,552 --> 00:19:40,013
one of these pieces of sh...

575
00:19:40,054 --> 00:19:42,890
short-term investments?

576
00:19:42,932 --> 00:19:44,892
Well, you know,
Gob told me that you wanted

577
00:19:44,934 --> 00:19:46,894
to start selling these things,
not just renting them,

578
00:19:46,936 --> 00:19:49,105
and I knew
it was important to you.

579
00:19:49,147 --> 00:19:50,606
He said all that, huh?
Oh, boy, that was...

580
00:19:50,648 --> 00:19:52,150
That's... nice of him.

581
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:53,901
How-how could you afford one
of these houses, buddy.

582
00:19:53,943 --> 00:19:55,486
Well, I have a lot
of money coming in

583
00:19:55,528 --> 00:19:57,363
-from investors
for my software thing, -Okay.

584
00:19:57,404 --> 00:19:59,824
and I don't know what's gonna
happen with that, so I thought

585
00:19:59,866 --> 00:20:01,826
I'd do what everyone around
here says: put it into Bluth.

586
00:20:01,868 --> 00:20:04,162
-Yeah, who else is saying that?
-You know, it's an expression.

587
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:05,955
-Neighbors.
-I don't like it.

588
00:20:05,997 --> 00:20:07,165
-Can I offer you anything?
-No.

589
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:08,248
I just got two more boxes

590
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:09,667
of Twister from the neighbors.

591
00:20:09,709 --> 00:20:11,585
-Oh, boy, return them.
-Feel like I have one

592
00:20:11,627 --> 00:20:14,005
for every day of the week now.
Anyway, you know, I figure that

593
00:20:14,047 --> 00:20:15,965
worse case scenario is I sell
this place, and I get

594
00:20:16,007 --> 00:20:17,466
my money back. It's not like

595
00:20:17,508 --> 00:20:18,926
-they're going down in value,
right? -Well...

596
00:20:18,968 --> 00:20:20,553
It's a great community.

597
00:20:20,594 --> 00:20:22,180
-Nobody locks their doors
around here. -You should.

598
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:24,640
Plus, I-I wanted
to make it up to you.

599
00:20:24,682 --> 00:20:26,308
You know, I felt terrible

600
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:28,644
about what happened
with the dorm and...

601
00:20:28,686 --> 00:20:30,270
-Wow. -And things between us.

602
00:20:30,312 --> 00:20:33,066
And I... I've screwed up
a lot of things

603
00:20:33,107 --> 00:20:34,942
in the past few weeks,

604
00:20:34,984 --> 00:20:37,236
and, you know,
this is the one thing

605
00:20:37,277 --> 00:20:39,488
that I know I did right.

606
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:42,033
I mean, who would not want
to raise their kids here?

607
00:20:42,075 --> 00:20:44,952
<i>And perhaps this is why</i>
<i>he didn't give him the bad news</i>

608
00:20:44,994 --> 00:20:46,453
<i>about the neighborhood.</i>

609
00:20:46,495 --> 00:20:48,122
Thank you.

610
00:20:48,164 --> 00:20:52,043
Thanks, but you didn't need
to do it for me, pal.

611
00:20:52,085 --> 00:20:54,420
<i>Now he just needed to get out</i>
<i>of the house before...</i>

612
00:20:54,461 --> 00:20:56,923
You know, to be totally honest,
I didn't just do it for you.

613
00:20:56,964 --> 00:20:58,883
-Yeah? -I also did it
for my girlfriend.

614
00:20:58,925 --> 00:21:00,300
Kind of wanted to impress her.

615
00:21:00,342 --> 00:21:03,096
<i>...that came up.</i>

616
00:21:03,137 --> 00:21:05,056
Wow.

617
00:21:05,098 --> 00:21:06,224
You got a girlfriend.

618
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:08,101
Good for you. That's great.

619
00:21:08,142 --> 00:21:09,852
Congratulations.

620
00:21:09,894 --> 00:21:11,145
Your dad's got one, too.

621
00:21:11,187 --> 00:21:12,271
-Oh, yeah?
-Yep.

622
00:21:12,312 --> 00:21:13,814
How is yours going?

623
00:21:13,856 --> 00:21:17,151
Not great.

624
00:21:17,193 --> 00:21:19,361
I haven't been
completely honest with her

625
00:21:19,403 --> 00:21:21,697
about who I am.

626
00:21:21,739 --> 00:21:24,366
You know, I haven't even
told her my real name,

627
00:21:24,408 --> 00:21:25,618
and I don't think

628
00:21:25,659 --> 00:21:28,246
I can keep that lie going, so...

629
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:30,206
I think it might be over.

630
00:21:30,248 --> 00:21:32,125
(sighing):
Oh, great...

631
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:36,712
pain fades slowly.

632
00:21:37,504 --> 00:21:39,215
Quickly.

633
00:21:39,257 --> 00:21:41,717
<i>-But now it was as simple</i>
<i>as getting out</i> -Thanks.

634
00:21:41,759 --> 00:21:43,385
<i>-before George Michael asked...</i>
-But what about you?

635
00:21:43,427 --> 00:21:45,054
You're doing great, huh?
Tell me about your girlfriend,

636
00:21:45,096 --> 00:21:47,140
and you're producing
this movie now.

637
00:21:47,181 --> 00:21:48,307
<i>...that.</i>

638
00:21:48,348 --> 00:21:49,892
I think they're both over.

639
00:21:49,934 --> 00:21:51,978
Yeah, it wasn't meant to be.

640
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:54,105
I'm sorry.

641
00:21:54,147 --> 00:21:56,983
<i>And that's when Michael finally</i>
<i>treated his son like an adult.</i>

642
00:21:57,024 --> 00:21:59,235
Hey, you know
what I miss on you?

643
00:21:59,277 --> 00:22:01,361
The mustache.

644
00:22:01,403 --> 00:22:03,990
<i>And so, discouraged,</i>
<i>Michael returned</i>

645
00:22:04,031 --> 00:22:08,161
<i>to his apartment,</i>
<i>only to find worse news.</i>

646
00:22:08,202 --> 00:22:10,288
<i>And when he saw that Lucille 2</i>

647
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:12,957
<i>was having a campaign event</i>
<i>at Cinco,</i>

648
00:22:12,999 --> 00:22:15,751
<i>he knew there was only</i>
<i>one thing he could give her</i>

649
00:22:15,793 --> 00:22:17,211
<i>instead of the money.</i>

650
00:22:17,253 --> 00:22:20,089
<i>And he knew</i>
<i>what he had to do first</i>

651
00:22:20,131 --> 00:22:22,466
<i>to give it to her.</i>

652
00:22:22,508 --> 00:22:25,886
<i>George Michael, meanwhile,</i>
<i>had a keynote speech to give,</i>

653
00:22:25,928 --> 00:22:29,182
<i>and hadn't totally decided</i>
<i>whether he should come clean.</i>

654
00:22:29,223 --> 00:22:31,058
<i>And that's when</i>
<i>he ran into his uncle.</i>

655
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:32,143
...we'll take care of.

656
00:22:32,185 --> 00:22:33,727
My father's got the money.

657
00:22:33,769 --> 00:22:35,521
-You guys are one heck
of a horde. -Uncle Gob!

658
00:22:35,562 --> 00:22:37,231
-No, you're mistaken, friend.
-No, it's George Michael.

659
00:22:37,273 --> 00:22:39,275
-Hi. Exactly.
-Yes.

660
00:22:39,317 --> 00:22:41,068
Hey, I'm actually
really glad I ran into you.

661
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:42,195
I could use some advice.

662
00:22:42,236 --> 00:22:43,821
Oh. Love each other.

663
00:22:43,863 --> 00:22:45,739
Oh, no, that's great,
but I actually need

664
00:22:45,781 --> 00:22:48,366
a specific piece of advice
for a certain situation.

665
00:22:48,408 --> 00:22:50,244
I'll give it to you fast.

666
00:22:50,286 --> 00:22:54,207
Basically, for the past few
weeks, I've been living a lie.

667
00:22:54,248 --> 00:22:56,583
I've been... in this
relationship with a woman

668
00:22:56,625 --> 00:22:58,460

00:23:15,769 --> 00:23:19,565
and I continue the lie
that Fakeblock exists.

678
00:23:20,983 --> 00:23:22,735
From my perspective...

679
00:23:22,776 --> 00:23:24,278
something about
"there's a girl..."

680
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,322
Did you... Does she like you?

681
00:23:26,364 --> 00:23:27,990
I mean, you're not the world's
most handsome guy.

682
00:23:28,032 --> 00:23:29,283
Yeah, no, she likes...

683
00:23:29,325 --> 00:23:30,534
I would say what
I did take away was that

684
00:23:30,576 --> 00:23:32,745
I would rather
have sex with someone

685
00:23:32,786 --> 00:23:34,663
because they thought
I was someone else

686
00:23:34,705 --> 00:23:38,292
than not have sex with someone
because they thought I was me.

687
00:23:38,334 --> 00:23:41,670
So I should probably
do the opposite of that and...

688
00:23:41,712 --> 00:23:46,175
be true to who I am and not
compromise my integrity

689
00:23:46,217 --> 00:23:49,095
just for some fleeting
sexual experience.

690
00:23:50,263 --> 00:23:52,265
-So, "love each other."
-There it is.

701
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:17,290

Wait, wait, you...

709

00:29:59,423 --> 00:30:00,591
This is what
I was talking about.

847
00:30:00,633 --> 00:30:01,592
I told you.

848
00:30:01,634 --> 00:30:03,051
I mean, we're like twins.

849
00:30:03,093 --> 00:30:04,261
Are we not like twins?

850
00:30:04,303 --> 00:30:05,845
All the way down
to the photo booth.

851
00:30:05,887 --> 00:30:07,473
You name me one way
in which we're different.

852
00:30:07,514 --> 00:30:10,392
Well, Dad, you know,
I never, in a million years,

853
00:30:10,434 --> 00:30:12,185
would have gone out
with her, if I knew that

854
00:30:12,227 --> 00:30:13,604
you were, you know,
the other guy.

855
00:30:13,646 --> 00:30:15,939
Me, neither.

856
00:30:15,981 --> 00:30:17,316
I wouldn't have, either.

857
00:30:17,357 --> 00:30:19,234
Damn it. You know?

858
00:30:19,276 --> 00:30:20,360
You gotta believe me.

859
00:30:20,402 --> 00:30:21,779
This is just...

860
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:23,489
-This is, uh...
-Yeah...

861
00:30:26,575 --> 00:30:28,786
How'd you know about
the photo booth?

862
00:30:35,083 --> 00:30:38,587
How... you... 'cause you said,
"Right down to the photo..."

863
00:30:38,629 --> 00:30:41,047
I said, "Right down
to the photo booth."

864

I am.

-Okay, this...
-Can we come in?

888
00:32:42,753 --> 00:32:44,129
This isn't my house.

-What is this regarding?
-That's all right.

890
00:32:47,966 --> 00:32:50,343
You're under arrest for the
murder of Lucille Austero.

Read him his rights.

892
00:32:51,929 --> 00:32:53,639
Okay, I think there's been
some kind of mistake.

893
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:55,682
That left hand might be
difficult to cuff.

894
00:32:55,724 --> 00:32:57,976
-Trouble cuffing him.
-I'm not a monster!

Well, the infamous Bluth family
is at it again,

this time
facing murder charges,

900
00:33:09,613 --> 00:33:12,574
and our Imagine cameras were
there to capture it all.

901
00:33:12,616 --> 00:33:13,867
Hey, did you see this?

902
00:33:13,909 --> 00:33:15,368
Yeah, I saw it just now
in the elevator.

903
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:16,703
Is this the family you've
been talking about?

904
00:33:16,745 --> 00:33:17,746
It sure is.

905
00:33:17,788 --> 00:33:19,205
Wow! You got the rights to this?

906
00:33:19,247 --> 00:33:20,582
Well, only for the killer--
but that's enough

907
00:33:20,624 --> 00:33:21,917
for us to get
a green light, right?

908

Absolutely!
It's our next<i> Da Vinci Code!</i>

Yay! That's great!

910
00:33:26,713 --> 00:33:29,382
Plus, it's gonna put
Imagine News on the map.

Remember: Love each other.
