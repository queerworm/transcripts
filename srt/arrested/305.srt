00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:02,460
[narrator 
NOW THE STORY

2
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:04,212
OF A WEALTHY FAMILY 
WHO LOST EVERYTHING...

3
00:00:04,212 --> 00:00:05,838
AND THE ONE SON 
WHO HAD NO CHOICE...

4
00:00:05,838 --> 00:00:07,173
BUT TO KEEP THEM ALL TOGETHER.

5
00:00:13,804 --> 00:00:15,848
IT'S ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT.

6
00:00:18,893 --> 00:00:20,520
[narrator] 
MICHAEL HAD SNUCK OUT OF WORK

7
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:21,854
TO SEE A BRITISH FILM...

8
00:00:21,854 --> 00:00:24,065
WITH HIS BRITISH GIRLFRIEND, 
RITA.

9
00:00:24,065 --> 00:00:26,151
- I HATE IT WHEN THEY HIRE 
YANKS TO PLAY BRITS.

10
00:00:26,151 --> 00:00:27,902
YOU CAN ALWAYS TELL.

11
00:00:27,902 --> 00:00:30,405
[narrator] 
WHEN THEY CAME UPON A TOY STORE.

12
00:00:30,405 --> 00:00:33,533
- WE SHOULD GET GEORGE MICHAEL 
ONE OF THESE.

13
00:00:33,533 --> 00:00:35,493
- OH, NO, THAT-THAT-THAT'S 
NOT REALLY HIM.

14
00:00:35,493 --> 00:00:38,288
BESIDES, I ALREADY GOT HIM HIS 
BIG PRESENT FOR HIS BIRTHDAY.

15
00:00:38,288 --> 00:00:40,081
- A SUIT! 
DAD, IT'S A JACK WELCH.

16
00:00:40,081 --> 00:00:43,543
- I WANT YOU TO LOOK 
UNDER THE PANTS.

17
00:00:43,543 --> 00:00:44,919
- QUICKEN! PREMIER.

18
00:00:44,919 --> 00:00:46,587
DAD, I HOPE YOU 
KEPT THE RECEIPT.

19
00:00:46,587 --> 00:00:50,175
- YOU WANNA RETURN THAT? 
- NO, I WANNA DEDUCT IT.

20
00:00:50,175 --> 00:00:53,303
- COME ON, LET'S GET HIM 
THE TRAIN.

21
00:00:53,303 --> 00:00:55,513
- IT'S-- REALLY, HE WOULD 
ONLY LIKE IT FOR THE RECEIPT.

22
00:00:55,513 --> 00:00:57,265
AND THIS IS CRAZY. 
I-I-I, REALLY--

23
00:00:57,265 --> 00:00:59,016
I CAN'T BE 
SEEING MOVIES IN THE AFTERNOON,

24
00:00:59,016 --> 00:01:00,101
THEN GOING TO TOY STORES.

25
00:01:00,101 --> 00:01:01,477
I-I HAVE TO WORK.

26
00:01:01,477 --> 00:01:02,853
I'M NOT 
EVEN SUPPOSED TO BE HERE.

27
00:01:02,853 --> 00:01:04,105
[narrator] 
MICHAEL COULDN'T

28
00:01:04,105 --> 00:01:05,815
TEAR HIMSELF AWAY.

29
00:01:05,815 --> 00:01:07,733
COULD YOU?

30
00:01:07,733 --> 00:01:09,527
- I CAN'T PROMISE IT'LL BE FUN.

31
00:01:09,527 --> 00:01:12,113
[Rita squealing] 
[Michael grunting]

32
00:01:13,739 --> 00:01:15,866
OKAY, THAT'S, UH, 
THAT WA-- THAT WAS FUN.

33
00:01:15,866 --> 00:01:17,952
STILL, THE LAND PROBABLY 
SHOULDN'T HAVE GIVEN OUT

34
00:01:17,952 --> 00:01:20,121
BENEATH US.

35
00:01:20,121 --> 00:01:21,997
BUT WE GOT A MOLE PROBLEM.

36
00:01:21,997 --> 00:01:23,583
- A MOLE PROBLEM?

37
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:25,460
- YEAH, THEY'VE UNDERMINED 
THIS WHOLE HILL.

38
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:27,253
WE WON'T BE ABLE TO BUILD 
ON IT FOR A FEW MONTHS.

39
00:01:27,253 --> 00:01:28,963
BUT IT'S MY FAULT.

40
00:01:28,963 --> 00:01:31,090
THIS IS EXACTLY WHY I SHOULD 
HAVE BEEN COMING TO WORK.

41
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:32,133
THE JAPANESE BACKERS,

42
00:01:32,133 --> 00:01:33,426
IF THEY FIND OUT ABOUT THIS--

43
00:01:33,426 --> 00:01:35,052
THAT WE HAVEN'T 
STARTED BUILDING,

44
00:01:35,052 --> 00:01:37,180
THEY MIGHT NOT COME THROUGH 
WITH THEIR INVESTMENTS.

45
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:38,306
- I WON'T TATTLE.

46
00:01:38,306 --> 00:01:40,558
I REALLY FANCY YOU.

47
00:01:40,558 --> 00:01:42,685
- I FANCY YOU TOO.

48
00:01:42,685 --> 00:01:46,147
[narrator] 
MICHAEL WAS FALLING FOR RITA.

49
00:01:46,147 --> 00:01:47,732
- [laughing] 
WHEE!

50
00:01:47,732 --> 00:01:49,150
[narrator] 
AND RITA WAS FALLING FOR

51
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:50,485
MICHAEL TOO.

52
00:01:50,485 --> 00:01:53,863
BUT THAT WASN'T 
PART OF THE PLAN.

53
00:01:53,863 --> 00:01:55,740
- RITA, YOU'VE DIRT 
ON YOUR FACE.

54
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:57,408
- IT'S FROM SCHOOL.

55
00:01:57,408 --> 00:02:00,453
- I CALLED THE SCHOOL, 
AND YOU WEREN'T THERE.

56
00:02:00,453 --> 00:02:02,788
YOU KNOW, WE'RE HERE TO LEARN 
THINGS, NOT FALL IN LOVE.

57
00:02:02,788 --> 00:02:06,917
- SO WHAT IF I HAVE? 
I'VE GOT FEELINGS, ALL RIGHT?

58
00:02:06,917 --> 00:02:08,628
I'M A WOMAN TOO!

59
00:02:08,628 --> 00:02:10,838
NOT SOME ROBOT YOU GET 
TO TELL EVERYTHING TO.

60
00:02:10,838 --> 00:02:14,342
I'M SICK OF IT! 
I'M SICK OF IT ALL!

61
00:02:14,342 --> 00:02:17,052
YOUR INSTRUCTIONS 
AND YOUR LETTERS!

62
00:02:17,052 --> 00:02:20,681
AND YOUR LITTLE MISSIONS. 
AND YOUR STUPID ASSIGNMENTS.

63
00:02:20,681 --> 00:02:24,101
"YOU DO THE MATH, RITA." 
WELL, NO, YOU DO THE MATH.

64
00:02:24,101 --> 00:02:25,270
[softly] 
OH, GOD.

65
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:27,021
- DO YOU REMEMBER THIS?

66
00:02:27,021 --> 00:02:29,524
AND THE PLEDGE THAT YOU MADE 
WHEN YOU WERE PROMISED IT?

67
00:02:29,524 --> 00:02:32,860
- I SAID I'D DO ANYTHING FOR IT. 
- I WANT HIM OUT OF THE PICTURE.

68
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:36,781
CAN YOU DO THAT? 
- I'M A BIG GIRL.

69
00:02:36,781 --> 00:02:39,367
[screams, laughs]

70
00:02:41,577 --> 00:02:43,288
[narrator] 
AND MICHAEL RETURNED

71
00:02:43,288 --> 00:02:44,372
HOME AS WELL.

72
00:02:44,372 --> 00:02:45,956
- HEY, WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?

73
00:02:45,956 --> 00:02:47,542
- [chuckles] OH, 
I GOT HIGHLIGHTS.

74
00:02:47,542 --> 00:02:48,959
IT'LL BLEND IN ABOUT A WEEK.

75
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:51,962
- HERE. YEAH, I ACTUALLY 
MEANT THE COLLAPSE.

76
00:02:51,962 --> 00:02:54,257
- IT PROBABLY HAS SOMETHING TO 
DO WITH THE 4,000 HAIR PLUGS

77
00:02:54,257 --> 00:02:56,133
I HAD IN ONE SITTING.

78
00:02:56,133 --> 00:02:58,219
- WELL, MAYBE YOU OUGHTA 
SEE A DOCTOR.

79
00:02:58,219 --> 00:03:00,012
- YEAH, BUT HE'S TOO BUSY 
GOING TO THE GYM TO SEE

80
00:03:00,012 --> 00:03:01,847
HIS FRIEND FRANK.

81
00:03:01,847 --> 00:03:04,058
- OH, WE'RE MORE THAN FRIENDS. 
I'M KIND OF HIS SPOTTER.

82
00:03:04,058 --> 00:03:05,476
MISSED A SPOT.

83
00:03:05,476 --> 00:03:07,228
ANYWAY, WE SHOULD BE 
LOOKING AT SOME BIG YEN

84
00:03:07,228 --> 00:03:09,230
COMING IN FROM THE JAPANESE.

85
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:10,690
AND WHEN IT DOES,

86
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:13,192
I'M TAKING MY GYM BUDDY 
OUT TO DINNER.

87
00:03:13,192 --> 00:03:14,860
[laughs] 
I BARELY EVEN KNOW YOU.

88
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:16,612
WHO'S FRANK?

89
00:03:16,612 --> 00:03:18,698
- I'VE BEEN WANTING TO TALK 
TO YOU ABOUT THAT,

90
00:03:18,698 --> 00:03:20,115
BUT IT'S A LITTLE AWKWARD.

91
00:03:20,115 --> 00:03:21,992
- OH, WELL. 
[chuckles]

92
00:03:21,992 --> 00:03:24,412
I'VE BEEN WANTING TO HAVE 
MY OWN AWKWARD TALK AS WELL.

93
00:03:24,412 --> 00:03:28,082
- I THINK WE CAN BE MORE 
THAN JUST GYM BUDDIES.

94
00:03:28,082 --> 00:03:30,125
- YOU'RE BLOWING MY MIND, FRANK.

95
00:03:30,125 --> 00:03:33,796
- I'M AN AGENT, AND I'D LIKE 
TO WORK WITH YOU.

96
00:03:33,796 --> 00:03:36,090
- OH. OH! 
[chuckles]

97
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:38,426
WELL, THAT IS GREAT NEWS. 
OKAY, GOOD.

98
00:03:38,426 --> 00:03:41,053
I'M SO GLAD YOU WENT FIRST. 
UH, UH WHAT AGENCY ARE YOU WITH?

99
00:03:41,053 --> 00:03:42,555
[narrator] 
FRANK SAID C.I.A.,

100
00:03:42,555 --> 00:03:44,181
A GOVERNMET AGENCY THAT WAS 
RESPONSIBLE

101
00:03:44,181 --> 00:03:47,017
FOR THIS CATASTROPHE.

102
00:03:47,017 --> 00:03:50,104
BUT TOBIAS THOUGHT HE SAID 
C.A.A., A TALENT AGENCY THAT WAS

103
00:03:50,104 --> 00:03:52,773
RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS ONE.

104
00:03:52,773 --> 00:03:54,275
- FRANK'S IN THE BUSINESS, 
MICHAEL.

105
00:03:54,275 --> 00:03:55,693
HE'S GOT A BIG 
PROJECT FOR ME.

106
00:03:55,693 --> 00:03:57,152
SAYS IT'S "TOP SECRET."

107
00:03:57,152 --> 00:03:59,739
HE KIND OF LOOKS LIKE YOU. 
SAME SIZE.

108
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:01,324
SAME CURLY HAIR.

109
00:04:01,324 --> 00:04:03,326
- TOBIAS, MAYBE 
YOU SHOULD SPEND LESS TIME...

110
00:04:03,326 --> 00:04:04,785
FOCUSED ON YOUR LOOKS,

111
00:04:04,785 --> 00:04:06,871
AND MORE TIME FOCUSED ON 
YOUR DAUGHTER, OKAY?

112
00:04:06,871 --> 00:04:09,123
HER GRADES ARE TERRIBLE. 
SHE'S GONNA START GETTING F's.

113
00:04:09,123 --> 00:04:10,833
[narrator] 
ACTUALLY, SHE'D

114
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:12,835
ALREADY GOTTEN ONE, 
AS THE MOVIE SHE'D RELEASED

115
00:04:12,835 --> 00:04:16,964
IN HER SECRET LIFE AS A STUDIO 
EXECUTIVE WAS LOSING MONEY.

116
00:04:16,964 --> 00:04:19,509
BUT MAEBY HAD A WAY TO FIX THAT.

117
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:21,594
- WE TURN IT INTO A RIDE. 
- A RIDE?

118
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:22,970
- ON THE STUDIO TOUR.

119
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:25,306
WHAT USED TO BE 
THE HELL TUNNEL...

120
00:04:25,306 --> 00:04:29,519
NOW BECOMES THE TUNNEL 
OF LOVE, INDUBITABLY.

121
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:31,396
- BUT DIDN'T SOME PEOPLE 
DIE IN HELL TUNNEL?

122
00:04:31,396 --> 00:04:33,022
- THAT IS AN URBAN LEGEND.

123
00:04:33,022 --> 00:04:35,566
TWO ELDERLY PEOPLE 
GOT BADLY SCALDED...

124
00:04:35,566 --> 00:04:37,610
WHEN THEY TRIED TO CLIMB 
INTO THE LAVA CAULDRON,

125
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:40,070
BUT I'VE GOT THAT COVERED.

126
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:42,156
- JUST LIKE THE POSTER!

127
00:04:42,156 --> 00:04:44,284
- GRADES LIKE THOSE, SHE'S 
GONNA BE TAKING TICKETS

128
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:45,993
AT A MOVIE THEATER 
THE REST OF HER LIFE.

129
00:04:45,993 --> 00:04:47,537
- YOU KNOW WHAT, YOU'RE 
ONE TO TALK.

130
00:04:47,537 --> 00:04:49,330
YOU'VE COMPLETELY 
IGNORED THIS FAMILY...

131
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:51,165
SINCE THAT BRITISH BIRD 
FLEW INTO YOUR LIFE.

132
00:04:51,165 --> 00:04:52,917
- NO, I HAVEN'T.

133
00:04:52,917 --> 00:04:54,960
WELL, MAYBE A LITTLE. 
BUT, YOU KNOW, SHE'S AMAZING.

134
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,296
YOU KNOW, SHE WAS 
IN THE OLYMPICS?

135
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:57,422
[narrator] 
SHE WASN'T.

136
00:04:57,422 --> 00:04:58,631
- SHE'S THAT RITA LEEDS?

137
00:04:58,631 --> 00:05:00,007
- MM-HMM.

138
00:05:00,007 --> 00:05:01,467
- WASN'T SHE ON 
THE COVER OF NEWSWEEK?

139
00:05:01,467 --> 00:05:02,510
[narrator] 
NO.

140
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:03,803
- YES.

141
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:05,220
[narrator] 
MICHAEL WAS THINKING

142
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:06,306
OF THIS MAN.

143
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:07,890
- SHE EVEN PLAYS THE BANJO.

144
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:09,767
ALTHOUGH, I DO HAVE TO SPEND 
MORE TIME AT WORK.

145
00:05:09,767 --> 00:05:11,769
I WAS AT THE PROPERTY 
THE JAPANESE FUNDED TODAY.

146
00:05:11,769 --> 00:05:13,563
THE WHOLE BACKSIDE HAS MOLES.

147
00:05:13,563 --> 00:05:16,816
- THAT'S FRANK'S PROBLEM TOO.

148
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:18,693
[narrator] 
LATER THAT DAY,

149
00:05:18,693 --> 00:05:21,321
MICHAEL WENT INTO THE OFFICE 
TO FIND THE REST OF HIS FAMILY.

150
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:24,365
- WELL, LOOK WHO'S FINALLY 
GRACING US WITH HIS PRESENCE.

151
00:05:24,365 --> 00:05:25,783
- WHAT'S THE SURROGATE 
DOING HERE?

152
00:05:25,783 --> 00:05:27,452
- WE'RE MEETING 
WITH THE LAWYERS.

153
00:05:27,452 --> 00:05:29,203
- SO I'VE HIRED THIS GUY 
TO BE MY EYES AND EARS.

154
00:05:29,203 --> 00:05:31,331
- YOU KNOW, DAD, THIS GUY 
COSTS US A FORTUNE.

155
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:32,998
- HE'S WORTH EVERY PENNY.

156
00:05:32,998 --> 00:05:35,460
- HEY, I DIDN'T SAY THAT. 
- OH, MICHAEL.

157
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:37,169
- MR. LOBLAW. 
- I'LL CATCH YOU UP.

158
00:05:37,169 --> 00:05:38,796
THE JAPANESE ARE COMING. 
- THEY ARE?

159
00:05:38,796 --> 00:05:40,381
- SOMEBODY TIPPED THEM OFF

160
00:05:40,381 --> 00:05:42,216
THAT THE PROPERTY WASN'T 
READY FOR BUILDING.

161
00:05:42,216 --> 00:05:43,968
- WHICH IT WOULD HAVE BEEN

162
00:05:43,968 --> 00:05:46,220
IF MICHAEL HADN'T BEEN SO BUSY 
WITH HIS ENGLISH MUFFIN.

163
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:47,888
- TYPICAL. 
- DELICIOUS.

164
00:05:47,888 --> 00:05:50,224
- I NEED A DRINK. 
- I'LL TAKE AN ENGLISH MUFFIN.

165
00:05:50,224 --> 00:05:53,185
- WE'LL HAVE TO BE HONEST 
WITH THESE JAPANESE INVESTORS.

166
00:05:53,185 --> 00:05:56,313
THEY, UH, COME FROM A CULTURE 
THAT VALUES HONOR AND RESPECT.

167
00:05:56,313 --> 00:06:01,360
- AND GODZILLA! 
[roaring]

168
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,112
- GODZIRRA! 
- JUST SIT DOWN.

169
00:06:03,112 --> 00:06:05,573
OKAY, GUYS. 
- GODZIRRA!

170
00:06:05,573 --> 00:06:08,033
[roaring] 
- [roaring]

171
00:06:08,033 --> 00:06:10,285
- THIS NEEDS TO STOP NOW!

172
00:06:10,285 --> 00:06:11,746
OKAY, THIS IS EXACTLY

173
00:06:11,746 --> 00:06:13,414
WHAT WE SHOULDN'T DO 
WHEN THEY SHOW UP.

174
00:06:13,414 --> 00:06:14,790
- [roaring] 
- MOM! THAT'S ENOUGH.

175
00:06:14,790 --> 00:06:16,041
- WHAT? 
WE'RE OUT OF VODKA.

176
00:06:16,041 --> 00:06:17,585
- SORRY.

177
00:06:17,585 --> 00:06:19,169
I THOUGHT YOU WERE 
DOING GODZILLA.

178
00:06:19,169 --> 00:06:20,880
- [shrieking like Godzilla]

179
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,632
- MOM, THAT'S ENOUGH. 
- WHAT? I'M LAUGHING.

180
00:06:22,632 --> 00:06:24,091
- OH. 
- HEY, MAYBE THAT'S IT.

181
00:06:24,091 --> 00:06:25,801
MAYBE WE SHOULD DO 
TO THE JAPANESE WHAT

182
00:06:25,801 --> 00:06:27,512
THEY DO IN THEIR MOVIES.

183
00:06:27,512 --> 00:06:29,597
BUILD A MINIATURE CITY. 
PUT IT OUTSIDE THE WINDOW.

184
00:06:29,597 --> 00:06:31,682
TELL THEM IT'S FAR AWAY.

185
00:06:31,682 --> 00:06:34,435
IT'LL LOOK REAL IF YOU SQUINT. 
GOD KNOWS THEY'RE SQUINTERS.

186
00:06:34,435 --> 00:06:36,353
WHAT DO YOU THINK, DAD? 
A WHOLE... "TINY TOWN."

187
00:06:36,353 --> 00:06:38,481
[music box]

188
00:06:38,481 --> 00:06:40,107
- ANOTHER BRILLIANT 
IDEA, EINSTEIN.

189
00:06:40,107 --> 00:06:41,901
- REALLY?

190
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:43,611
YOU LIKE TO BUILD IT WITH ME?

191
00:06:43,611 --> 00:06:47,114
- LARRY REALLY NEVER KNOWS 
HOW TO SELL THE SARCASM.

192
00:06:47,114 --> 00:06:48,783
- IT'S A STUPID IDEA.

193
00:06:48,783 --> 00:06:51,952
- UH. I'LL BUILD IT 
WITH YOU, GOB.

194
00:06:51,952 --> 00:06:54,413
- OH, GREAT, THAT'S ANOTHER 
BRILLIANT IDEA, STEINBERG.

195
00:06:54,413 --> 00:06:56,248
- I AGREE WITH MICHAEL.

196
00:06:56,248 --> 00:06:58,668
IF YOU TAKE MONEY FROM THESE 
PEOPLE UNDER FALSE PRETENSES,

197
00:06:58,668 --> 00:07:00,419
YOU'LL BE COMMITTING FRAUD.

198
00:07:00,419 --> 00:07:02,672
THE GOVERNMENT'S ALREADY 
WATCHING YOUR FATHER CLOSELY.

199
00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:04,256
THEY'RE GOING THROUGH HIS MAIL.

200
00:07:04,256 --> 00:07:06,091
THEY WANT TO PUT YOUR FATHER 
IN PRISON FOR GOOD.

201
00:07:06,091 --> 00:07:07,677
- YEAH, BOB'S RIGHT.

202
00:07:07,677 --> 00:07:09,595
WE'VE GOT TO START 
THINKING PRACTICALLY.

203
00:07:09,595 --> 00:07:12,139
LIFE IS NOT SOME 
CHEESY JAPANESE MOVIE...

204
00:07:12,139 --> 00:07:14,349
WHERE THE HERO PULLS ON 
A PAIR OF JET PANTS AND--

205
00:07:14,349 --> 00:07:16,060
- FLIES OFF THE BALCONY 
LIKE ASTROBOY.

206
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:17,728
[narrator] 
AND THAT'S WHEN GEORGE SR.

207
00:07:17,728 --> 00:07:19,146
DID A WEB SEARCH FOR

208
00:07:19,146 --> 00:07:21,356
THE WORDS, "JET PANTS."

209
00:07:21,356 --> 00:07:23,067
- EVEN BETTER.

210
00:07:23,067 --> 00:07:25,570
- THE BIGGER PROBLEM IS, 
WHO ALERTED THE JAPANESE?

211
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:28,363
I THINK YOU MIGHT HAVE A SPY. 
THIS ROOM, OR SOMEONE IN IT,

212
00:07:28,363 --> 00:07:30,491
MIGHT EVEN BE WIRED 
WITH A LISTENING DEVICE.

213
00:07:33,494 --> 00:07:36,497
YOU NEED TO FIND 
THAT LEAK AND PLUG IT.

214
00:07:36,497 --> 00:07:39,041
YOUR FATHER SAID THAT HE WAS 
SET UP BY A BRITISH SYNDICATE.

215
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:40,918
MAYBE YOU SHOULD LOOK 
FOR SOMEBODY ENGLISH.

216
00:07:40,918 --> 00:07:42,503
- [woman singing] 
FOR BRITISH EYES ONLY

217
00:07:42,503 --> 00:07:44,672
- WHAT?

218
00:07:44,672 --> 00:07:47,382
- I THINK MICHAEL'S 
ALREADY PLUGGED OUR LEAK.

219
00:07:47,382 --> 00:07:49,051
- WHAT IS THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

220
00:07:49,051 --> 00:07:50,845
- YOU'VE BEEN SPENDING 
A LOT OF TIME WITH RITA.

221
00:07:50,845 --> 00:07:53,889
AND SHE'S "BRITISHISH." 
- SHE'S A SPY.

222
00:07:53,889 --> 00:07:55,349
- I HAVEN'T TOLD RITA ANYTHING.

223
00:07:55,349 --> 00:07:57,935
[narrator] 
THIS WAS NOT STRICTLY TRUE.

224
00:07:57,935 --> 00:07:59,895
LET'S START WITH 
MY FAMILY'S MISDEMEANORS,

225
00:07:59,895 --> 00:08:01,188
AND THEN PUSH 
RIGHT ON THROUGH TO

226
00:08:01,188 --> 00:08:02,231
THE LIGHTER TREASONS.

227
00:08:02,231 --> 00:08:03,983
THE JAPANESE BACKERS--

228
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:06,026
IF THEY FIND OUT THAT 
WE HAVEN'T STARTED BUILDING,

229
00:08:06,026 --> 00:08:08,195
THEY MIGHT NOT COME THROUGH 
WITH THEIR INVESTMENTS.

230
00:08:08,195 --> 00:08:10,114
THEN HE SIPHONED OFF 
THE ENTIRE PENSION FUND

231
00:08:10,114 --> 00:08:11,907
INTO A DUMMY CORPORATION,

232
00:08:11,907 --> 00:08:13,367
FILED FOR BANKRUPTCY,

233
00:08:13,367 --> 00:08:15,369
AND USED-- DO YOU KNOW 
ANY OTHER SONGS?

234
00:08:15,369 --> 00:08:17,329
- SHE'S A SPY! 
- RITA IS NOT A SPY, OKAY?

235
00:08:17,329 --> 00:08:18,956
SHE'S A BEAUTIFUL, 
ELEGANT WOMAN.

236
00:08:18,956 --> 00:08:20,958
IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE.

237
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:23,043
- WHAT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE 
IS WHY SHE'S DATING YOU.

238
00:08:23,043 --> 00:08:24,629
- NO, THAT'S A GOOD POINT.

239
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:26,463
ACTUALLY, MY SOURCES 
TELL ME THAT THE LEAK

240
00:08:26,463 --> 00:08:27,798
GOES BY THE NAME "MR. F."

241
00:08:27,798 --> 00:08:29,174
- [woman singing] 
MR. F

242
00:08:29,174 --> 00:08:30,843
- AH, MR. F. 
RITA'S NOT A MAN.

243
00:08:30,843 --> 00:08:33,262
- AS FAR AS YOU KNOW. 
- AND IT COULD BE AN ALIAS.

244
00:08:33,262 --> 00:08:36,015
- ALIAS IS A SHOW ABOUT A SPY! 
- ALL RIGHT, THAT'S IT!

245
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:37,725
I FINALLY FIND SOMEONE THAT

246
00:08:37,725 --> 00:08:39,852
I REALLY CARE ABOUT, MY FAMILY 
TRIES TO DRIVE US APART.

247
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:41,270
IT'S NOT GONNA WORK.

248
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:43,063
SO YOU KNOW WHAT? 
I GOT A SWITCH FOR YOU.

249
00:08:43,063 --> 00:08:46,567
YOU GUYS HANDLE THIS PROBLEM. 
I AM GONNA GO HAVE SOME FUN.

250
00:08:46,567 --> 00:08:48,318
- UNBELIEVABLE.

251
00:08:48,318 --> 00:08:50,237
DESERTING THE FAMILY 
WHEN WE MOST NEED HIM.

252
00:08:50,237 --> 00:08:51,739
SHAMEFUL.

253
00:08:51,739 --> 00:08:53,741
- GOB, I'M SENDING YOU 
A PACKAGE.

254
00:08:53,741 --> 00:08:56,326
YOU'LL KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH I.

255
00:08:56,326 --> 00:08:57,745
[narrator] 
MICHAEL WAS UPSET,

256
00:08:57,745 --> 00:08:58,871
AND HE CALLED RITA.

257
00:08:58,871 --> 00:09:00,414
- HELLO?

258
00:09:00,414 --> 00:09:02,792
- HEY, 
I'VE BEEN THINKING.

259
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:04,710
I'M GOING TO START 
WORKING LESS, AND I DO WANT

260
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:06,921
TO START HAVING MORE FUN.

261
00:09:06,921 --> 00:09:09,256
SO, I'D LIKE TO 
TAKE YOU OUT TOMORROW.

262
00:09:09,256 --> 00:09:11,717
ALL DAY, ANYWHERE YOU WANT. 
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

263
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:13,761
[TV announcer] 
HELL TUNNEL TAKES ANOTHER NAME.

264
00:09:13,761 --> 00:09:15,345
WILL IT TAKE ANOTHER LIFE?

265
00:09:15,345 --> 00:09:18,307
- OH, I SAY YES.

266
00:09:18,307 --> 00:09:20,935
ONLY, I'M GOING 
TO TAKE YOU OUT.

267
00:09:20,935 --> 00:09:27,650
[woman singing] 
MR. F

268
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:29,359
[narrator] 
THE NEXT MORNING,

269
00:09:29,359 --> 00:09:31,153
MICHAEL WAS HEADING OUT 
FOR HIS DAY WITH RITA.

270
00:09:31,153 --> 00:09:32,988
- GEORGE MICHAEL. 
- HEY, I LOVE MY PRESENT, DAD.

271
00:09:32,988 --> 00:09:35,199
I'D WEAR IT TO SCHOOL, BUT 
WHO NEEDS A WELCH WEDGE, RIGHT?

272
00:09:35,199 --> 00:09:36,241
- [chuckles] 
YEAH.

273
00:09:36,241 --> 00:09:37,952
- THAT'S WHEN THEY--

274
00:09:37,952 --> 00:09:40,079
- ENOUGH BUSINESS. IN FACT, 
I GOT YOU ANOTHER PRESENT.

275
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:42,247
IT'S SOMETHING I SAW YESTERDAY 
WHEN I WAS OUT WITH RITA.

276
00:09:42,247 --> 00:09:43,916
IT'S TIME FOR US 
TO START HAVING SOME FUN.

277
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:45,585
- I DON'T KNOW.

278
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:48,045
"FUN" AND "FAILURE" 
BOTH START OUT THE SAME WAY.

279
00:09:48,045 --> 00:09:50,255
- LET'S JUST GO AHEAD 
AND RIP THIS DOWN, HUH?

280
00:09:54,969 --> 00:09:57,221
[narrator] 
AND LARRY, THE SURROGATE,

281
00:09:57,221 --> 00:09:59,223
SHOWED UP TO PICK UP 
THE JET PACK THAT GEORGE SR.

282
00:09:59,223 --> 00:10:01,684
HAD SENT TO THE MODEL HOME.

283
00:10:01,684 --> 00:10:04,478
- WHAT IS THAT, A TRAIN SET? 
LOOK DOWN, LARRY.

284
00:10:04,478 --> 00:10:07,481
- NO, NOT DOWN AT YOUR FEET. 
- LEFT.

285
00:10:07,481 --> 00:10:09,233
MY LEFT, YOUR RIGHT.

286
00:10:09,233 --> 00:10:11,235
- WHAT IS THE MATTER 
WITH THIS GUY?

287
00:10:11,235 --> 00:10:12,695
AND, LET ME GUESS, 
HE'S PROBABLY--

288
00:10:12,695 --> 00:10:14,446
- SAYING ALL THAT TOO.

289
00:10:14,446 --> 00:10:18,826
- IT IS A TRAIN SET! 
THOSE JAPANESE SITES.

290
00:10:18,826 --> 00:10:22,162
I'M NEVER GONNA FIND MY WAY-- 
- PAST THAT HALLWAY SENSOR.

291
00:10:22,162 --> 00:10:26,333
- DAD, WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? 
IS THIS THE PACKAGE YOU SENT ME?

292
00:10:27,918 --> 00:10:29,461
TINY TOWN.

293
00:10:29,461 --> 00:10:32,172
THIS IS FOR 
TINY TOWN, ISN'T IT?

294
00:10:32,172 --> 00:10:34,842
YOU DID LIKE MY IDEA, 
DIDN'T YOU, DAD?

295
00:10:34,842 --> 00:10:36,927
- I THINK HE'S IN THE CAN.

296
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:38,262
[narrator] 
ACTUALLY, GEORGE SR.

297
00:10:38,262 --> 00:10:39,930
WAS IN THE KITCHEN,

298
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:43,017
TRYING TO SOOTHE HIMSELF 
WITH AN ICE CREAM SANDWICH.

299
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:47,562
AND THAT'S WHEN HE DISCOVERED

300
00:10:47,562 --> 00:10:50,565
A WAY TO POSSIBLY SLIP BY 
THE SENSORS.

301
00:10:50,565 --> 00:10:54,028
- IF MOTHER SEES THIS, 
SHE WILL BLOW A COW.

302
00:10:54,028 --> 00:10:55,821
[groaning]

303
00:10:58,032 --> 00:11:00,993
- UH-OH. 
- DAD?

304
00:11:02,327 --> 00:11:03,871
OH, COOL, A TRAIN SET.

305
00:11:03,871 --> 00:11:06,581
- OH, I'VE ALWAYS WANTED 
ONE OF THOSE.

306
00:11:06,581 --> 00:11:10,002
- MAYBE WE COULD BUILD 
OUR TINY TOWN TOGETHER.

307
00:11:10,002 --> 00:11:12,296
DO YOU WANT TO, DAD?

308
00:11:12,296 --> 00:11:13,839
[narrator] 
BUSTER HAD ALWAYS WANTED

309
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:15,340
TO DO THE SAME WITH GOB.

310
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:18,343
- GOODY! YEAH. 
I DO WANT TO.

311
00:11:18,343 --> 00:11:20,846
- YEA. 
I DO WANT TO. GOODY.

312
00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:24,391
[narrator] 
GOB WAS THRILLED, AS WAS BUSTER.

313
00:11:24,391 --> 00:11:26,268
ONLY LARRY WAS DISAPPOINTED.

314
00:11:26,268 --> 00:11:28,896
BUT HE WAS SUCH A PRO 
YOU'D NEVER KNOW IT.

315
00:11:28,896 --> 00:11:30,940
AND BACK AT THE GYM, TOBIAS WAS

316
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:34,193
FINDING OUT MORE ABOUT THE 
PROJECT THE AGENT HAD SUGGESTED.

317
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:35,235
- COME ON!

318
00:11:35,235 --> 00:11:36,320
WHAT ARE 
YOU GONNA TELL ME?

319
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,030
WHAT'VE YOU GOT FOR ME?

320
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:40,365
- THE JAPANESE INVESTORS 
YOU TOLD US ABOUT ARE GOING

321
00:11:40,365 --> 00:11:42,159
OVER TO YOUR PLACE TODAY.

322
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:44,619
I NEED YOU THERE WHEN THEY ARE. 
WE NEED YOU TO BE A MOLE.

323
00:11:44,619 --> 00:11:47,998
- OH. 
KIND OF A BACKER'S AUDITION.

324
00:11:47,998 --> 00:11:49,750
OKAY, I GET IT. 
ALL RIGHT. WELL THEN, FRANK,

325
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:52,044
I SHALL BE A BIGGER,

326
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:55,005
HAIRIER MOLE THAN THE ONE 
ON YOUR INNER LEFT THIGH.

327
00:11:55,005 --> 00:11:56,048
[laughing]

328
00:11:56,048 --> 00:11:57,632
[narrator] 
AND LATER,

329
00:11:57,632 --> 00:11:59,760
MICHAEL AND RITA WERE ON 
THE TANTAMOUNT STUDIOS TOUR.

330
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,428
- THE THING SHE DOESN'T 
UNDERSTAND ABOUT

331
00:12:01,428 --> 00:12:02,972
BOVINE 
SPONGIFORM ENCEPHALITIS IS--

332
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:04,514
- HOLD! HOLD! 
THE TRAM.

333
00:12:04,514 --> 00:12:06,266
LET'S GET OUT 
OF HERE, FOLKS! MAKE SOME ROOM!

334
00:12:06,266 --> 00:12:07,684
MAKE SOME ROOM!

335
00:12:07,684 --> 00:12:09,061
- LOOK! IT'S MALCOLM 
IN THE MIDDLE!

336
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:10,645
- IN THE MIDDLE OF SHOOTING, 
I GUESS.

337
00:12:10,645 --> 00:12:12,397
- OH, THAT'S OKAY.

338
00:12:12,397 --> 00:12:14,608
IT'S MORE IMPORTANT TO SHOW 
HOW WE MAKE THE SHOW

339
00:12:14,608 --> 00:12:16,526
THAN ACTUALLY MAKE IT.

340
00:12:16,526 --> 00:12:18,195
[bleep] TANTAMOUNT.

341
00:12:18,195 --> 00:12:19,905
[ringing] 
- HELLO?

342
00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:21,490
- THEY DROPPED 
OFF THE PACKAGE YOU SENT,

343
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:23,075
BUT I DON'T THINK 
I'M OLD ENOUGH FOR IT.

344
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:24,910
- OF COURSE YOU ARE.

345
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:27,454
I WANT YOU TO HAVE A LITTLE FUN. 
YOU'RE NOT GONNA BREAK ANYTHING.

346
00:12:27,454 --> 00:12:29,164
[narrator] 
BUT OF COURSE,

347
00:12:29,164 --> 00:12:31,208
MICHAEL THOUGHT HE WAS 
TALKING ABOUT THE TRAIN SET.

348
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:33,085
NOT THE EXTREMELY 
DANGEROUS JET PACK THE BOY HAD

349
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:35,754
JUST FOUND AT THE FRONT DOOR.

350
00:12:35,754 --> 00:12:38,048
- WELL, WHAT IF I CRASH IT? 
- THAT'S HALF THE FUN.

351
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:42,177
[narrator] 
AND SOON THE TOUR ARRIVED AT

352
00:12:42,177 --> 00:12:45,014
THE TUNNEL OF LOVE, INDUBITABLY.

353
00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:46,431
[Woman On P.A.] 
SO TAKE THE HAND

354
00:12:46,431 --> 00:12:48,392
OF SOMEONE YOU LOVE...

355
00:12:48,392 --> 00:12:51,645
AS WE ENTER THE TUNNEL 
OF LOVE, INDUBITABLY.

356
00:12:51,645 --> 00:12:52,771
[Man on P.A.] 
NO, LOVE HELL.

357
00:12:52,771 --> 00:12:54,231
[laughing]

358
00:12:54,231 --> 00:12:55,900
[narrator] 
BUT MICHAEL WAS HAPPY TO HOLD

359
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:58,485
THE HAND OF SOMEONE HE DID LO.

360
00:12:58,485 --> 00:13:00,863
AND THEN, 
HE NOTICED HER BRACELET.

361
00:13:07,161 --> 00:13:08,996
[narrator] 
MICHAEL HAD

362
00:13:08,996 --> 00:13:12,666
JUST NOTICED THAT RITA WAS 
WEARING A SUSPICIOUS BRACELET.

363
00:13:12,666 --> 00:13:13,959
- WHAT DOES YOUR BRACELET SAY?

364
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:16,170
- [chuckling] 
NOTHING.

365
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:20,007
OH, LOOK. LOOK, THERE THEY ARE 
ON THE BICYCLE MADE FOR TWO.

366
00:13:20,007 --> 00:13:22,843
- IT SAYS MR. F, DOESN'T IT? 
WHO IS HE?

367
00:13:22,843 --> 00:13:25,220
- NOBODY. 
I CAN'T TELL YOU!

368
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:28,348
OH, GOD. 
HE FOLLOWED US.

369
00:13:28,348 --> 00:13:31,101
- WAIT A MINUTE. 
YOU KNOW THAT MAN?

370
00:13:31,101 --> 00:13:33,938
- IT'S NOT WHAT YOU THINK IT IS. 
IT'S MY UNCLE.

371
00:13:33,938 --> 00:13:35,397
- IS THAT MR. F? 
WHAT DOES HE WANT?

372
00:13:35,397 --> 00:13:38,067
- HE WANTS YOU 
OUT OF THE PICTURE.

373
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:40,360
- BLOODY RIGHT I DO. 
- H-HEY!

374
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:44,614
- OH! 
- YOU LIED TO ME, RITA!

375
00:13:44,614 --> 00:13:46,033
YOU MADE ME TURN 
AGAINST MY FAMILY.

376
00:13:46,033 --> 00:13:47,993
BUT IT'S OVER NOW.

377
00:13:47,993 --> 00:13:51,621
[buzzer sounding] 
- OH! ME-- [bleep] ARE WET.

378
00:13:51,621 --> 00:13:53,165
- [whimpers]

379
00:13:53,165 --> 00:13:54,749
[narrator] 
AND MAEBY RECEIVED

380
00:13:54,749 --> 00:13:57,211
A CALL ABOUT THE LATEST 
LAVA CAULDRON ACCIDENT.

381
00:13:57,211 --> 00:13:59,088
- ALREADY? 
IT'S ONLY BEEN AN HOUR.

382
00:13:59,088 --> 00:14:00,589
I'M GONNA LOSE THIS JOB.

383
00:14:00,589 --> 00:14:02,382
MAYBE I SHOULD LET MORT 
TAKE ME OUT TO DINNER.

384
00:14:02,382 --> 00:14:03,968
- MAEBY?

385
00:14:03,968 --> 00:14:05,677
- OKAY, I'M DEFINITELY 
GONNA LOSE THIS JOB.

386
00:14:05,677 --> 00:14:07,054
I CAN EXPLAIN.

387
00:14:07,054 --> 00:14:08,638
- RITA SET ME UP. 
SHE SET US ALL UP.

388
00:14:08,638 --> 00:14:10,640
THIS BEAUTIFUL, FUNNY, 
BRILLIANT WOMAN WAS A SPY.

389
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:12,434
EVERYBODY WAS RIGHT.

390
00:14:12,434 --> 00:14:14,561
IT WAS TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE. 
AND I... AM TURNING HER IN.

391
00:14:14,561 --> 00:14:16,688
LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING ELSE.

392
00:14:16,688 --> 00:14:20,817
I WOULD NOT WANT TO BE THE NEXT 
WOMAN WHO TRIES TO FOOL ME.

393
00:14:20,817 --> 00:14:23,028
- WELL, THAT WAS A FREEBIE. 
[chuckles]

394
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:24,654
[narrator] 
GEORGE MICHAEL,

395
00:14:24,654 --> 00:14:26,740
MEANWHILE, WAS TRYING TO 
SOLVE A MYSTERY OF HIS OWN.

396
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:28,700
[speaking Japanese] 
THE JET PACK...

397
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:31,078
HAD COME WITH AN INSTRUCTIONAL 
DVD THAT SEEMED TO CONFUSE

398
00:14:31,078 --> 00:14:34,206
MORE THAN CLARIFY.

399
00:14:34,206 --> 00:14:35,749
WHAT WAS CLEAR 
WAS THAT THE GIFT WAS

400
00:14:35,749 --> 00:14:38,793
EXTREMELY DANGEROUS.

401
00:14:38,793 --> 00:14:43,465
[cartoon robot, woman 
both speaking Japanese ]

402
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:50,890
AND IT DID SEEM 
LIKE A LOT OF WORK...

403
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:53,850
FOR A LITTLE PAYOFF.

404
00:14:53,850 --> 00:14:55,685
- HAVE FUN! 
HAVE FUN.

405
00:14:55,685 --> 00:14:57,437
[narrator] 
MEANWHILE, GOB WAS BONDING

406
00:14:57,437 --> 00:14:59,564
WITH THE MAN HE THOUGHT 
HIS FATHER WAS CONTROLLING.

407
00:14:59,564 --> 00:15:01,191
- ALMOST DONE 
WITH THE WATER TOWER.

408
00:15:01,191 --> 00:15:03,527
- NEAT-O.

409
00:15:03,527 --> 00:15:05,862
[narrator] 
HIS REAL FATHER, HOWEVER, HAD

410
00:15:05,862 --> 00:15:08,073
GOTTEN LOST WITHIN THE WALLS.

411
00:15:08,073 --> 00:15:09,658
- WHERE THE HELL AM I?

412
00:15:09,658 --> 00:15:11,368
[narrator] 
HE WAS ACTUALLY SOMEWHERE

413
00:15:11,368 --> 00:15:13,412
BETWEEN THE LINEN CLOSET 
AND THE GUEST ROOM.

414
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:15,414
- I'M REALLY GLAD THAT 
WE'RE DOING THIS TOGETHER.

415
00:15:15,414 --> 00:15:16,623
[chuckles]

416
00:15:16,623 --> 00:15:18,083
I'VE NEVER FELT 
SO CLOSE TO YOU.

417
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:20,585
- OH! 
I FEEL THE SAME WAY.

418
00:15:20,585 --> 00:15:24,089
- HE'S CRYING NOW. 
- OH, GOD, LOOK AT US.

419
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:26,841
WE'RE LIKE A COUPLE OF GIRLS 
ON THE LAST DAY OF CAMP.

420
00:15:29,344 --> 00:15:31,180
[narrator] 
RIGHT OUTSIDE THE HOUSE,

421
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:34,724
TOBIAS WAS WORKING WITH THE MAN 
HE THOUGHT WAS A TALENT AGENT.

422
00:15:34,724 --> 00:15:36,185
- YOU READY?

423
00:15:36,185 --> 00:15:37,686
- OH, YES. 
I'M GONNA BE A GREAT MOLE.

424
00:15:37,686 --> 00:15:39,271
[chuckling] 
CHECK, TWO, THREE.

425
00:15:39,271 --> 00:15:40,940
"LET LILLY LICK 
LIONEL'S LUSTY LEATHERS.

426
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,899
LET LILLY LICK LIONEL'S--" 
- THE LEVELS ARE FINE.

427
00:15:42,899 --> 00:15:44,443
- ALL RIGHT.

428
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:46,403
- REMEMBER, NO ONE 
CAN KNOW IT'S YOU.

429
00:15:46,403 --> 00:15:49,073
WE NEED TO CAPTURE GEORGE SR. 
- CAPTURE GEORGE SR.?

430
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:50,782
WHAT-- IS THAT WHAT 
YOU HIRED ME TO DO?

431
00:15:50,782 --> 00:15:52,617
- YOU DIDN'T REALIZE THAT?

432
00:15:52,617 --> 00:15:54,161
- NO. BUT IT DOES 
MAKE PERFECT SENSE.

433
00:15:54,161 --> 00:15:57,247
I HAVE PLAYED HIM BEFORE.

434
00:15:57,247 --> 00:15:59,124
[narrator] 
HE HAD, IN THE POORLY NARRATED

435
00:15:59,124 --> 00:16:01,626
REALITY SERIES, SCANDALMAKERS.

436
00:16:01,626 --> 00:16:03,920
- IT'S GONNA BE TOUGH TO WORK 
THAT INTO THE CHARACTER,

437
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:06,006
AND IT'S GOING TO FIGHT 
THE COSTUME I RENTED,

438
00:16:06,006 --> 00:16:08,050
BUT I DIDN'T TAKE SIX WEEKS 
OF IMPROV CLASSES AT

439
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:09,301
THE GROUNDLINGS FOR NOTHING.

440
00:16:09,301 --> 00:16:10,510
[chuckling]

441
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:12,012
[narrator] 
MICHAEL WAS ON THE PHONE

442
00:16:12,012 --> 00:16:13,222
TO BOB LOBLAW.

443
00:16:13,222 --> 00:16:14,974
- I DON'T EVEN THINK

444
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:16,350
SHE'S HERE LEGALLY, 
ALL RIGHT?

445
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:17,767
SHE'S TAKEN ADVANTAGE 
OF ME.

446
00:16:17,767 --> 00:16:19,436
I-I WANT YOU TO 
TAKE CARE OF THIS.

447
00:16:19,436 --> 00:16:21,646
CALL THE C.I.A., 
DO WHATEVER YOU HAVE TO DO.

448
00:16:21,646 --> 00:16:23,232
- FINE, BUT YOU TAKE CARE 
OF YOUR FAMILY.

449
00:16:23,232 --> 00:16:25,150
I THINK THEY'RE 
GOING AHEAD WITH THIS HOAX.

450
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:28,487
AND IF MONEY CHANGES HANDS, 
YOU'RE ALL GOING TO JAIL.

451
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:31,031
- WELL, UNFORTUNATELY THE ROADS 
ARE OUT, SO WE CAN'T TAKE YOU

452
00:16:31,031 --> 00:16:32,699
UP THERE TO SEE IT IN PERSON,

453
00:16:32,699 --> 00:16:35,702
BUT IF YOU STAND ABSOLUTELY 
STILL RIGHT THERE,

454
00:16:35,702 --> 00:16:37,287
AND JUST SQUINT 
IN-INTO THE LIGHT,

455
00:16:37,287 --> 00:16:39,414
AND BEHOLD, SUDDEN HILL!

456
00:16:39,414 --> 00:16:42,209
- GOB! 
DON'T!

457
00:16:42,209 --> 00:16:44,003
[narrator] 
IT ACTUALLY LOOKED PRETTY GOOD.

458
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:45,462
EVEN THE FINANCIERS THOUGHT SO.

459
00:16:45,462 --> 00:16:47,256
ISHIRO SAID,

460
00:16:47,256 --> 00:16:50,467
"I AM REASSURED. AND THEY TREAT 
US WITH RESPECT THIS TIME."

461
00:16:50,467 --> 00:16:52,177
MOTOYOSHI SAID,

462
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:55,139
"I THOUGHT THE WOMAN WAS 
PRETENDING AS A MONSTER,

463
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:57,141
BUT SHE WAS 
JUST OUT OF VODKA."

464
00:16:57,141 --> 00:16:59,268
- LET'S GO AHEAD AND CLOSE 
THE CURTAINS, AND NOT ACCEPT

465
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:00,894
ANY MONEY WHILE WE'RE AHEAD.

466
00:17:00,894 --> 00:17:02,687
- SO, AS YOU CAN SEE, 
ANY RUMOR OF A MOLE PROBLEM

467
00:17:02,687 --> 00:17:05,190
IS COMPLETELY UNTRUE.

468
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:07,276
[narrator] 
BUT, UNFORTUNATELY,

469
00:17:07,276 --> 00:17:09,819
THIS WAS JUST AS TOBIAS APPEARED 
IN HIS RENTED MOLE OUTFIT.

470
00:17:09,819 --> 00:17:12,572
- [Tobias] I'M A MOLE! 
- NOT THE VILLAGE!

471
00:17:12,572 --> 00:17:15,492
- FAMILIES CAN COME-- OW! OW!

472
00:17:15,492 --> 00:17:17,411
I'M VERY PARTICULAR 
ABOUT BUILDING CODES.

473
00:17:17,411 --> 00:17:19,954
- THE WATER TOWER.

474
00:17:19,954 --> 00:17:23,292
- AND THIS WATER TOWER 
DOES NOT PASS MUSTER.

475
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:25,294
LUCILLE! 
- WHO CAN SAVE OUR VILLAGE?

476
00:17:25,294 --> 00:17:26,670
[narrator] 
AS IT TURNED OUT,

477
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:28,547
IT WAS GEORGE MICHAEL... 
WHO HAD FINALLY

478
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:30,715
GOTTEN HIS GRANDFATHER'S 
JET PACK TO WORK.

479
00:17:30,715 --> 00:17:32,801
- [laughing] 
- [grunting]

480
00:17:32,801 --> 00:17:34,636
- HARD TO BREATHE IN THIS THING.

481
00:17:34,636 --> 00:17:37,347
IT'S REALLY HOT. 
I'M SWEATING ALL OVER MYSELF.

482
00:17:37,347 --> 00:17:39,933
- [gasps] 
- I CAN'T STOP THIS THING!

483
00:17:39,933 --> 00:17:41,726
- YOU'RE BLOWING MY AUDITION!

484
00:17:41,726 --> 00:17:44,188
[narrator translating] 
I ACHE WITH EMBARRASSMENT.

485
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:49,901
THE JAPANESE WERE NEVER 
TO BE HEARD FROM AGAIN.

486
00:17:49,901 --> 00:17:52,446
- OKAY, WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

487
00:17:53,947 --> 00:17:56,241
OKAY, THAT'S NO SURPRISE. 
GEORGE MICHAEL?

488
00:17:56,241 --> 00:17:57,701
- DAD, I-I'M SORRY.

489
00:17:57,701 --> 00:17:59,119
I CAN'T FLY IT VERY WELL, 
ALL RIGHT?

490
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:00,662
I THINK I WOULD 
RATHER HAVE THE WELCH.

491
00:18:00,662 --> 00:18:02,539
- I DIDN'T BUY YOU THAT.

492
00:18:02,539 --> 00:18:04,999
I BOUGHT YOU THE TRAIN SET, 
WHICH YOU GUYS JUST DESTROYED.

493
00:18:04,999 --> 00:18:07,043
- DID YOU KEEP THE RECEIPT? 
[feedback squealing]

494
00:18:07,043 --> 00:18:08,753
- WHAT IS THAT?

495
00:18:08,753 --> 00:18:11,381
- IT'S FEEDBACK. 
IS SOMEONE ELSE WIRED?

496
00:18:11,381 --> 00:18:12,716
- OH, THAT'S ME. 
[chuckles]

497
00:18:12,716 --> 00:18:14,509
MY FRIEND FRANK WIRED ME.

498
00:18:14,509 --> 00:18:17,137
HE WANTED ME TO BE A MOLE. 
- OUR COVER'S BLOWN.

499
00:18:17,137 --> 00:18:20,807
LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.

500
00:18:20,807 --> 00:18:23,059
GOOD-BYE, TOBIAS.

501
00:18:23,059 --> 00:18:26,313
- HE WANTED YOU TO BE A MOLE? 
[tires screeching]

502
00:18:26,313 --> 00:18:28,273
OH, MY GOD. 
TOBIAS FUNKE

503
00:18:28,273 --> 00:18:29,774
YOU'RE MR. F.

504
00:18:29,774 --> 00:18:31,360
WHICH MEANS THAT MAN WAS 
RITA'S UNCLE.

505
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,153
WHAT HAVE I DONE?

506
00:18:33,153 --> 00:18:35,655
- I HAVE TO GET THIS SUIT BACK. 
- THEY DESTROYED OUR TOWN.

507
00:18:35,655 --> 00:18:37,449
BUT THEY CAN'T 
TAKE AWAY OUR MEMORIES.

508
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:38,867
- OH! I'VE HAD--

509
00:18:38,867 --> 00:18:40,285
- THE TIME OF MY LIFE.

510
00:18:40,285 --> 00:18:43,079
- I THINK HE'S BEING 
SARCASTIC, GOB.

511
00:18:43,079 --> 00:18:44,164
- NO, I'M NOT, MOTHER.

512
00:18:44,164 --> 00:18:46,750
[gasps] 
I MEAN LOVER.

513
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:49,253
- I LIKE MAKING LOVE TO MOTHER. 
- I MEAN LOVER!

514
00:18:49,253 --> 00:18:50,587
- OH, MY GOD. 
BUSTER, IS THAT YOU?

515
00:18:50,587 --> 00:18:52,672
- YES.

516
00:18:52,672 --> 00:18:56,135
GOB, IT'S JUST I WANTED 
TO SPEND SOME TIME WITH YOU.

517
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:57,552
THAT'S ALL. 
AND YOU ENJOYED IT.

518
00:18:57,552 --> 00:18:59,346
YOU CAN'T DENY THAT.

519
00:18:59,346 --> 00:19:02,391
- [sighs] 
I GUESS YOU'RE RIGHT.

520
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:04,268
MAYBE WE SHOULD SPEND 
MORE TIME TOGETHER.

521
00:19:04,268 --> 00:19:08,188
- OH, I'D REALLY LIKE THAT. 
- IT'S WEIRD.

522
00:19:08,188 --> 00:19:10,524
IT TOOK SOME IDIOT PARROT MAN 
WITH A CAMERA IN HIS HAT

523
00:19:10,524 --> 00:19:14,110
TO BRING US TOGETHER.

524
00:19:14,110 --> 00:19:15,779
[narrator] 
BUT EVEN A PRO LIKE LARRY

525
00:19:15,779 --> 00:19:17,113
HAS A BREAKING POINT.

526
00:19:17,113 --> 00:19:20,409
[knocking] 
- RITA.

527
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:22,035
- WHAT DO YOU WANT?

528
00:19:22,035 --> 00:19:24,413
I HAVE TO PACK. 
- PACK? WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

529
00:19:24,413 --> 00:19:25,789
- SOMEONE CALLED 
THE BOBBIES ON US.

530
00:19:25,789 --> 00:19:27,874
- NO, NO.

531
00:19:27,874 --> 00:19:29,668
- MY UNCLE AND I HAVE 
TO GO BACK TO BIG BRITAIN.

532
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:30,752
- OH, THAT WAS ME, RITA.

533
00:19:30,752 --> 00:19:32,171
I AM SO, SO SORRY.

534
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:33,630
I DIDN'T KNOW 
WHAT WAS GOING ON.

535
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:35,840
WHY DID YOUR UNCLE 
THREATEN ME?

536
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,842
- HE THOUGHT 
YOU MIGHT BE TROUBLE.

537
00:19:37,842 --> 00:19:39,594
- THAT WAS ACTUALLY 
VERY ASTUTE OF HIM.

538
00:19:39,594 --> 00:19:42,556
- GOOD-BYE, MICHAEL.

539
00:19:42,556 --> 00:19:44,057
YOU KNOW, 
I REALLY DID FANCY YOU.

540
00:19:44,057 --> 00:19:46,435
I CAN'T STAY HERE NOW.

541
00:19:46,435 --> 00:19:49,188
- MARRY ME. 
- WHAT?

542
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:51,648
- LET ME MARRY YOU.

543
00:19:51,648 --> 00:19:53,858
YOU CAN GET A GREEN CARD, 
YOU-YOU CAN STAY AND WE CAN JUST

544
00:19:53,858 --> 00:19:55,444
SEE IF THIS WORKS, YOU KNOW?

545
00:19:55,444 --> 00:19:57,654
IT SOUNDS CRAZY, BUT THIS 
WILL GIVE US A CHANCE...

546
00:19:57,654 --> 00:19:59,323
TO GET AWAY FROM 
BOTH OF OUR FAMILIES

547
00:19:59,323 --> 00:20:01,241
AND SEE IF THIS WORKS.

548
00:20:01,241 --> 00:20:04,578
MIGHT BE FUN. 
- [softly] YES.

549
00:20:04,578 --> 00:20:08,707
- REALLY? 
- YES.

550
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:11,125
YES, YES, YES!

551
00:20:11,125 --> 00:20:13,253
BUT LET'S GO RIGHT NOW, OKAY?

552
00:20:13,253 --> 00:20:15,880
BEFORE MY UNCLE GETS OUT OF THE 
SHOWER FOR SOME MORE CIGARETTES.

553
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:17,924
YOU TAKE THAT, 
I GOTTA LEAVE A NOTE.

554
00:20:24,556 --> 00:20:26,433
[narrator] 
BUT THERE WAS

555
00:20:26,433 --> 00:20:28,602
ONE PIECE OF INTELLIGENCE 
THAT MICHAEL DIDN'T HAVE.

556
00:20:28,602 --> 00:20:30,061
- INTERESTING.

557
00:20:30,061 --> 00:20:31,355
- DON'T EVEN 
THINK ABOUT IT, JAY.

558
00:20:31,355 --> 00:20:33,440
SHE'S AN M.R.F.

559
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:37,444
- M.R.F.? WHAT'S THAT? 
- MENTALLY RETARDED FEMALE.

560
00:20:37,444 --> 00:20:40,239
- THAT EXPLAINS WHAT 
SHE'S DOING WITH HIM.

561
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:41,448
- AND THE HATS.

562
00:20:45,494 --> 00:20:48,788
- OH, MY GOD! 
SHE'S GONNA MARRY HIM.

563
00:20:48,788 --> 00:20:49,831
[narrator] 
ON THE NEXT

564
00:20:49,831 --> 00:20:51,791
ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT.

565
00:20:51,791 --> 00:20:54,002
GEORGE SR., DISORIENTED 
IN THE WALLS, ALMOST MAKES

566
00:20:54,002 --> 00:20:57,672
CONTACT WITH A NEW MOLE.

567
00:20:57,672 --> 00:21:00,967
- [screams]

568
00:21:00,967 --> 00:21:03,720
[narrator] 
NOT THAT ONE. WAIT FOR IT.

569
00:21:07,223 --> 00:21:10,143
AND MICHAEL AND RITA 
START A NEW LIFE TOGETHER.

570
00:21:10,143 --> 00:21:13,480
- WHAT'S THAT? 
- A PRIZE.

571
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:16,858
A LOVELY, LOVELY PRIZE.
