{\an8}[Ron Howard] <i>Now the story</i>
<i>of a wealthy family</i>

2
00:00:12,303 --> 00:00:15,473
{\an8}<i>who lost everything,</i>
<i>and the one son who had no choice</i>

3
00:00:15,557 --> 00:00:17,100
{\an8}<i>but to keep them all together.</i>

4
00:00:23,106 --> 00:00:24,899
{\an8}<i>It's...</i>

5
00:00:28,778 --> 00:00:31,906
{\an8}<i>Michael Bluth had just reunited</i>
<i>with his family.</i>

6
00:00:32,824 --> 00:00:35,618
{\an8}Now that the original Michael's back,
I suppose we don't need two

7
00:00:35,702 --> 00:00:38,496
{\an8}hands-on-our-hips,
pipe-up-our-rectum scolds.

8
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:39,914
{\an8}So you can go.

9
00:00:39,998 --> 00:00:41,207
{\an8}Back to playing Tobias. Yes.

10
00:00:41,291 --> 00:00:44,711
{\an8}Exactly, because I am still
a valued family member.

11
00:00:45,837 --> 00:00:48,506
{\an8}At least until both signatures are
on the divorce papers, which were

12
00:00:49,215 --> 00:00:51,843
{\an8}so cruelly served to me
from the back seat of my car

13
00:00:51,926 --> 00:00:53,970
{\an8}by someone who thought
I was a Lyft driver.

14
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:55,764
{\an8}Could have been the pink mustache.

15
00:00:56,306 --> 00:00:57,265
{\an8}Oh, how funny.

16
00:00:57,807 --> 00:00:59,893
{\an8}Lucille thought it looked pink, too.

17
00:00:59,976 --> 00:01:01,811
{\an8}[G.O.B.]
That's because everybody's thinking

18
00:01:01,936 --> 00:01:03,480
{\an8}about Tony Wonder's beard.

19
00:01:03,563 --> 00:01:05,148
{\an8}-It was pink, right?
-[Tobias] I dyed it

20
00:01:05,231 --> 00:01:07,400
{\an8}what I assumed was the color
of Michael's skin.

21
00:01:07,484 --> 00:01:10,111
{\an8}Although now that you're back,
I do wish I had used

22
00:01:10,195 --> 00:01:11,905
{\an8}a less permanent dye.

23
00:01:11,988 --> 00:01:13,865
{\an8}I only remember the thing about Tony

24
00:01:13,948 --> 00:01:16,701
{\an8}because of the "W,"
and his beard was a "W,"

25
00:01:16,785 --> 00:01:19,204
{\an8}which I thought, you know,
for Wonder, was funny.

26
00:01:19,287 --> 00:01:20,747
{\an8}You know, it tickled me.

27
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:22,665
{\an8}-His beard tickled me.
-Yeah.

28
00:01:22,749 --> 00:01:26,044
{\an8}[stammers] And is that part of what
you look so confused about?

29
00:01:26,419 --> 00:01:27,712
{\an8}It is on the list.

30
00:01:27,796 --> 00:01:29,964
{\an8}I want to go back
to why you're all in here, though.

31
00:01:30,048 --> 00:01:32,425
{\an8}Oh, we're shooting footage for Lindsay.

32
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:33,968
{\an8}Campaign footage.

33
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:38,014
{\an8}<i>-You're </i>running for office now?
-[chuckles]

34
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:40,809
{\an8}As a matter of fact, I am.
I want to be part of the problem.

35
00:01:40,892 --> 00:01:42,685
[Ron] <i>Although, weeks earlier,</i>

36
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:45,146
<i>Lindsay wasn't eager</i>
<i>to rejoin the family herself.</i>

37
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:47,649
So, how's Mom? Is she mad at me?

38
00:01:47,732 --> 00:01:49,442
Mad at you?
Why would she be mad at you?

39
00:01:50,485 --> 00:01:51,611
You didn't hear?

40
00:01:51,694 --> 00:01:56,157
There may be some
compromising pictures of me

41
00:01:56,241 --> 00:01:57,867
with the candidate Herbert Love.

42
00:01:58,076 --> 00:02:00,912
[scoffs] If she saw those,
she'd never let me hear the end of it.

43
00:02:00,995 --> 00:02:02,664
Oh, listen,

44
00:02:02,747 --> 00:02:06,417
you're intelligent
and you're wonderful and ethical

45
00:02:06,501 --> 00:02:08,253
and you're great. I mean, don't worry.

46
00:02:08,336 --> 00:02:09,546
She's jealous.

47
00:02:10,088 --> 00:02:13,133
[Ron] <i>Lindsay had never heard</i>
<i>her father talk this way.</i>

48
00:02:13,216 --> 00:02:15,885
-Jealous of me?
-Mm.

49
00:02:17,387 --> 00:02:19,305
It's probably just because I'm younger.

50
00:02:19,389 --> 00:02:20,932
A <i>puta.</i>

51
00:02:21,015 --> 00:02:22,809
You know, yes, she did mention that.

52
00:02:22,892 --> 00:02:25,562
Maybe it's time to just, uh,
change your ways.

53
00:02:25,645 --> 00:02:26,646
Start fresh.

54
00:02:26,729 --> 00:02:30,316
[Ron] <i>And perhaps Lindsay would have</i>

57

It's Mom.

58
00:02:35,488 --> 00:02:36,781
[Lindsay] <i>Mom. Hi.</i>

59
00:02:37,532 --> 00:02:39,492
[Lucille] I need you to run for office.

60
00:02:39,576 --> 00:02:42,412
I told Herbert Love's campaign
that you'd be taking over.

61
00:02:42,495 --> 00:02:44,873
What? No. Mom, I can't do that.

62
00:02:45,707 --> 00:02:49,669
It would mean going up against Lucille 2,
and Sally Sitwell is running her campaign.

63
00:02:49,752 --> 00:02:52,589
Lucille 2 is not going to be a problem.

64
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:54,757
<i>And Sally hasn't been seen since Cinco.</i>

65
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:56,176
[Ron] <i>It was true.</i>

66
00:02:56,259 --> 00:02:58,094
<i>Sally had stolen a lot of money.</i>

67
00:02:58,178 --> 00:03:00,722
If G.O.B. finds out you're straight,
he'll use it to ruin you.

68
00:03:00,805 --> 00:03:03,641
I'll lose the hundred grand
I stole from Lucille Austero

69
00:03:03,725 --> 00:03:05,476
to rebrand you as the gay magician.

70
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,978
[Ron] <i>But when Sally found out</i>

71
00:03:07,061 --> 00:03:10,440
<i>Lucille Austero's political opponent</i>
<i>had been knocked out...</i>

72
00:03:11,524 --> 00:03:13,484
<i>she chose to get out of town</i>

73
00:03:13,568 --> 00:03:16,070
{\an8}<i>before people started asking questions.</i>

74
00:03:16,738 --> 00:03:19,282
<i>-She packed light.</i>
-I'm wondering if someone could help me.

75
00:03:19,365 --> 00:03:21,284
-[Tony] Somebody say "Wonder"?
-[Sally] Not wonder.

76
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:22,994
-No one's wondering!
-[Ron] <i>Just Tony.</i>

77
00:03:23,077 --> 00:03:24,621
[Lucille] <i>So, you're unopposed...</i>

78
00:03:25,163 --> 00:03:26,664
and I need you. [sighs]

[Ron]<i> It was the first time</i>

80
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:31,169
<i>Lindsay's mother had ever told her</i>
<i>she needed her.</i>

81
00:03:31,252 --> 00:03:32,170

{\an8}[Ron] <i>Well, she read it.</i>

86
00:03:46,809 --> 00:03:50,939
I hate everything about my life,
including you.

87
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:53,441
Well, that's not the horniest thing
I've heard.

88
00:03:53,524 --> 00:03:54,901
Daddy not horny.

89
00:03:54,984 --> 00:03:56,945
Yeah, I guess these shirts

90
00:03:57,028 --> 00:03:59,239
kind of pumped up the pressure on that.

91
00:03:59,322 --> 00:04:02,158
[laughs] I don't know
what's wrong with me.

92
00:04:03,701 --> 00:04:06,329
I feel like one of these bulls
on my breasts.

94
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:09,707
His whole life,
he's bred to be the strongest

95
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:12,835
and the toughest
and he's got to have the biggest balls.

96
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:13,836
Why?

97
00:04:14,295 --> 00:04:17,507
So when you're in your prime,
they can drug you

98
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:20,009
and throw you out
in front of a crowd of people

99
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:21,636
who just want to see you die

100
00:04:22,136 --> 00:04:25,223
so some guy
in crushed velvet pants can come out

101
00:04:25,306 --> 00:04:28,685
and just stick a sword in you.

102
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:31,813
You're a bull who wants
to stick it in everybody,

103
00:04:31,896 --> 00:04:34,983
and everybody ends up sticking it in you.

104
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:37,777
[Ron] <i>And G.O.B. started opening up, too.</i>

105
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:39,654
I tried to buy those velvet pants.

106
00:04:40,905 --> 00:04:43,408
But I chickened out
and got these shirts instead.

107

00:07:16,185 --> 00:07:18,229
I mean, it's so much more responsibility!

168
00:07:18,312 --> 00:07:20,523
He's making it sound more important
than it really is.

169
00:07:20,606 --> 00:07:21,524
Is he?

170
00:07:21,607 --> 00:07:25,695
She was married to that news anchor
who said such horrible things

171
00:07:25,778 --> 00:07:28,698
about me when I was trying
to save Buster with that boat.

172
00:07:28,781 --> 00:07:30,366
-John Beard.
-[G.O.B.] Yeah.

173
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:33,119
She's my Beard now.

174
00:07:33,202 --> 00:07:34,912
[Michael] What I meant was,
what organization

175
00:07:34,996 --> 00:07:36,914
-is giving you the award?
-[Lucille] Well,

176
00:07:36,998 --> 00:07:39,709
technically,
it's from the Bluth-Austero Company.

177
00:07:39,792 --> 00:07:41,752
Oh, I see.
So you're giving it to yourself.

178
00:07:41,836 --> 00:07:44,464
Well, it's mostly from the Austero side.

179
00:07:44,547 --> 00:07:46,299
[Lindsay] Perfect timing for my campaign.

180
00:07:46,382 --> 00:07:47,633
[George Sr.] Our Lindsay.

181
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:50,219
I've never been less ashamed of her.

182
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:53,681
-[gasps] Did I say what I think I said?
-[George Sr.] Yes, you did. [laughs]

183
00:07:53,764 --> 00:07:55,725
[laughing]

184
00:07:56,851 --> 00:07:58,853
Hey, man, look who's joining in!

185
00:07:59,687 --> 00:08:01,147
Where is Lucille Austero?

186
00:08:01,856 --> 00:08:03,149
[dramatic music playing]

187
00:08:13,242 --> 00:08:14,327
No one knows.

188
00:08:15,786 --> 00:08:16,829
Oh.

189
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:21,417
She flew the coop.
In the middle of running for Congress.

190
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:25,421
I mean, no one remembers seeing her
since Cinco de Cuatro.

191
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:27,840
And we didn't want the crew in our house.

192
00:08:27,924 --> 00:08:31,219
No, and it was okay with Lucille 2.
She gave us the key.

193
00:08:31,302 --> 00:08:34,680
It was during the 1992
African-American riots,

194
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:36,307
and they had every right.

195
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:38,100
-Every right.
-[Lindsay] Every right.

196
00:08:38,893 --> 00:08:39,977
Mm.

197
00:08:40,061 --> 00:08:43,314
I find all of this...
it's just very hard to believe.

198
00:08:43,397 --> 00:08:45,149
[G.O.B.] Tell you
what is hard beyond belief.

199
00:08:45,233 --> 00:08:47,735
My God, I wish you could get
a feel on these two things

200
00:08:47,818 --> 00:08:49,529
that Joni's got going over here.

201
00:08:49,612 --> 00:08:51,364
[laughs] They're like two geodes!

202
00:08:51,447 --> 00:08:52,823
-Hmm.
-[Joni] You can feel them.

203
00:08:52,907 --> 00:08:54,825
I can't. My go-to joke

204
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:57,787
is that these are the best two things
John Beard's money can buy.

205
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:59,080
-[chuckles]
-That's a go-to.

206
00:08:59,163 --> 00:09:01,249
[Lucille] Now you're back.
You'll bring George Michael.

207
00:09:01,332 --> 00:09:03,751
We'll show the world
what a great family we are.

208
00:09:03,834 --> 00:09:06,337
Oh, that's good.
Family is so important to me.

209
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:08,506
-Sometimes my own family.
-[Ron]<i> Actually,</i>

210
00:09:08,589 --> 00:09:10,550
<i>Michael hadn't spoken</i>
<i>to his son in months</i>

211
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:13,261
<i>and didn't even know he had been</i>
<i>in Mexico.</i>

212
00:09:13,344 --> 00:09:15,763
Can we get four pretzels, two Cokes,
and two Mexican Cokes?

213
00:09:16,514 --> 00:09:17,932
My friend, you're in <i>México.</i>

214
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:20,184
We have Coke and American Coke.

215
00:09:21,727 --> 00:09:22,853
I didn't wish to offend.

216
00:09:22,937 --> 00:09:25,439
I'm sorry. I'm probably grumpy
because I was out

217
00:09:25,523 --> 00:09:27,441
late last night, raping and murdering.

218
00:09:27,525 --> 00:09:29,235
Not cool. I wouldn't joke about that.

219
00:09:29,318 --> 00:09:32,989
I rape and murder, and I joke.

220
00:09:33,197 --> 00:09:35,616
[Ron] <i>And feeling unwelcome in this land</i>

221
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,910

222
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:39,954
<i>George Michael returned home,</i>

223
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:44,375
<i>but wasn't quite ready</i>
<i>to deal with real life.</i>

224
00:09:46,627 --> 00:09:49,171
<i>And seeing his father had left town,</i>

225
00:09:49,672 --> 00:09:53,759
<i>and perhaps not ready to return</i>
<i>to the responsibilities he'd left,</i>

226
00:09:54,552 --> 00:09:56,554

Hello? Here to clean the windows!

229
00:10:02,643 --> 00:10:04,437
[Ron] <i>And upon finding it empty,</i>

230
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:07,648
<i>he soon began what can</i>
<i>only be described as...</i>

231
00:10:07,732 --> 00:10:10,192
[man] <i>Total regression!</i>

Oh, my God, Quicken.

235
00:10:22,663 --> 00:10:24,624
God, it's so much smaller
than I remember.

236
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:26,292
[Ron]<i> Perhaps it was a yearning</i>

237
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:29,295
<i>to go back to a simpler,</i>
<i>less complicated time.</i>

238
00:10:29,837 --> 00:10:33,591
<i>But there was no denying he was older</i>
<i>and more mature.</i>

239
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:37,720
<i>Not to mention, looking for love.</i>

[Ron] <i>But aside from a few setbacks,</i>

243
00:10:55,613 --> 00:10:58,824
<i>George Michael was enjoying</i>
<i>a break from responsibility.</i>

244
00:10:58,908 --> 00:11:01,202
[George Michael] For scenario two,
you just found out

245
00:11:01,285 --> 00:11:03,412
that your Darth Vader figure
is dating your girlfriend,

246
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:06,957
and you find out he knew she was your...
Whatever. Who gives a shit?

247

As usual, guys,
just apply your own scenarios to these.

-Well, truthfully...

No, I'll just tell you the truth:
it's a wig.

00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:44,180
would add some years to her,
but, turns out, nope.

278

Everything I've given her

280
00:12:48,142 --> 00:12:51,145
to do or say has only made her
go up in the polls.

281
00:12:51,228 --> 00:12:52,938
It's like the more offensive it is,

282
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:54,982
-the more people get behind her.

a big rise in the polls.

302
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:40,069

Well, it probably doesn't help that,

307
00:13:48,702 --> 00:13:51,372
Yeah. That's why I came up with
the idea for us to kiss.

308
00:13:52,456 --> 00:13:54,375
So the kissing is part of a plan?

309
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:56,710
Yeah. I thought we could do it
when the whole family

310
00:13:56,794 --> 00:13:58,879

the Family of the Year Award.

311
00:13:59,421 --> 00:14:01,257

Who'd give us that?

-We're giving it to ourselves.
-Right.

313
00:14:04,134 --> 00:14:05,970
Still doesn't seem like
we'd get the votes.

314
00:14:06,053 --> 00:14:07,847
So when my mom's giving the speech,

315
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:10,266
we'll be in the background,
and we're just going at it.

316
00:14:10,349 --> 00:14:11,767

Kind of feels like you have.

319
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:18,274
To me, it seems like what you really want

320
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:20,442
is for your mother
to see you for who you are.

321
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:23,362
Why don't you write a speech
for her to say about you,

322
00:14:23,445 --> 00:14:25,239

00:14:49,054 --> 00:14:51,473
for some meth money, Mom?"
You know, or something like that.

333
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:53,517
-I feel like we're circling it.
-Yeah.

334
00:14:54,018 --> 00:14:56,228
I don't know, maybe that's just a shade

335
00:14:56,353 --> 00:14:57,688
unnecessarily cruel.

336
00:14:59,106 --> 00:15:01,442
Well,
at least I didn't punch her in the face.

337
00:15:01,525 --> 00:15:04,653
Ah, I still feel so weird.
I haven't even seen my dad since that day.

338
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:06,572
Yeah. He seems fine.

339
00:15:07,281 --> 00:15:09,658
-Oh, you've seen him?
-Yeah. He's across the hall.

340
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:12,453
-Wait, who is?
-Everyone.

341
00:15:12,536 --> 00:15:15,539
-Your dad, my mom, the whole family.
-My dad's across the hall?

342
00:15:15,623 --> 00:15:17,333
[Ron] <i>Where Michael's father currently had</i>

343
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:19,084
<i>his own son in a panic.</i>

344
00:15:19,168 --> 00:15:20,669
-No, I'm fine.
-Yeah?

345
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:22,755
I'm fine. It's just, uh,
I like, you know...

346
00:15:22,838 --> 00:15:24,506
I just like the feeling of, uh...

347
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:26,800
[exhales] ...feeling something.

348
00:15:26,884 --> 00:15:29,887
It's just nice to have
some control over one's life.

349
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:32,640
But your mother is a wonderful person!

350
00:15:32,973 --> 00:15:34,516
I've screamed the same thing many times

351
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,143
I was worried she was in earshot.

352
00:15:36,685 --> 00:15:37,937
You sure you two are okay?

353
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:40,272
I mean, the last I heard,
you two were getting a divorce,

354
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:42,524
and now it seems like everything's just...

355
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:43,651
-Forgotten?
-[Michael] Yeah.

356
00:15:43,734 --> 00:15:45,653
[Lucille] You know our family motto.

357
00:15:45,736 --> 00:15:48,155
We forget, but we never forgive.

358
00:15:48,238 --> 00:15:50,157
I remember the framed needlepoint.

359
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:53,410
You'll see. In life,
you don't want to carry that much hate.

360
00:15:54,036 --> 00:15:55,663
[Michael] Although, by not forgiving,

361
00:15:55,746 --> 00:15:58,290
you're throwing everything out
and <i>just </i>keeping the hate.

362
00:15:58,374 --> 00:16:01,043
Well, how do you think
she keeps that figure?

363
00:16:01,126 --> 00:16:03,504
{\an8}No. Okay, I'm going for a feeling.

364
00:16:03,587 --> 00:16:04,838
-Let's get inside.
-I'm fine.

365
00:16:04,922 --> 00:16:06,465
-That's enough air.
-I'm fine. Hey!

366
00:16:06,548 --> 00:16:08,634
What's that trophy gonna look like, huh?

367
00:16:08,717 --> 00:16:10,928
Oh! Everyone gets a trophy, huh, Pop?

368
00:16:11,011 --> 00:16:12,846
-Well...
-When I was a kid,

369
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:15,891
you said, "You want a trophy?
Try harder, G.O.B."

370
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:17,434
Huh. Well, maybe I...

371
00:16:17,518 --> 00:16:19,311
-did something right, huh?
-But I was like,

372
00:16:19,395 --> 00:16:21,563
"But you gave one to everybody else.

373
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:23,607
What happened to
everybody gets a trophy?"

374
00:16:23,691 --> 00:16:25,651
There was that then.
It was getting started, but...

375
00:16:25,734 --> 00:16:28,404
Meanwhile,
the guy who could've tried harder

376
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:31,907
is now giving it to the not super young,
obviously,

377
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:35,035
but still fairly well known
local TV host whose breasts--

378
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:37,788
and you're gonna be surprised
to hear this coming from me--

379
00:16:37,871 --> 00:16:39,665
may be a little bit too hard. [laughs]

380
00:16:39,748 --> 00:16:41,792
High class problem, huh, Mike?

381
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:43,752
I wish you could get a feel
next time, Mike.

382
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:45,713
There is something not right with those.

383
00:16:45,796 --> 00:16:48,007
Yeah, well,
I'm in town such a short time,

384
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:49,800
-so next time.
-Well... [laughs]

385
00:16:49,883 --> 00:16:51,051
One less trophy, huh, Mom?

386
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:53,637
There's one trophy: The Golden Anchor,

387
00:16:53,721 --> 00:16:55,264
and Lindsay gets it.

388
00:16:55,347 --> 00:16:58,058
Wait, what?
For Family of the Year?! No!

389
00:16:58,142 --> 00:17:00,060
We need her to be the center of this.

390
00:17:00,144 --> 00:17:01,854
She's the one running for office.

391
00:17:01,937 --> 00:17:03,731
What about Dad?
You're the head of the family.

392
00:17:03,814 --> 00:17:06,275
You're the alpha. Or me, for that matter.

393
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:08,485
I am the CEO. Mom said.

394
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:10,112
Fine, I'll get trophies for everyone.

395
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:12,114
[scoffs] Everyone gets a trophy.

396
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:14,408
[chuckles] Count me out.

397
00:17:14,491 --> 00:17:16,827
-Fine. Everyone but G.O.B.
-No!

398
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:19,538
[Maeby] <i>You sure I didn't mention that</i>
<i>in the text?</i>

399
00:17:19,621 --> 00:17:20,998
Yeah. I read that thing down.

400
00:17:21,081 --> 00:17:22,458
-Hmm.
-Should I go say hi to him?

401
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:24,084
I haven't seen my Darth since I hit him.

402
00:17:24,168 --> 00:17:26,003
What if he asks me about Rebel?

403
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:28,756
That's the love of his life,
that he gave up for me,

404
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:30,549
and I haven't even called her once.

405
00:17:30,632 --> 00:17:31,633
Just tell him that.

406
00:17:32,259 --> 00:17:34,094
-The truth, huh?
-Yeah.

407
00:17:34,178 --> 00:17:35,679
Sometimes, the truth can hurt a man

408
00:17:35,763 --> 00:17:38,557
more than the most brutally fashioned lie.

409
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:40,184
I should get out of here.

410
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:42,227
[Michael] <i>Is anyone else noticing</i>

411
00:17:42,311 --> 00:17:46,774
that the family isn't quite,
uh, as we remember them?

412
00:17:46,857 --> 00:17:49,860
-In what way?
-That is not Buster.

413
00:17:50,861 --> 00:17:52,237
Oh, I'm in.

414
00:17:52,321 --> 00:17:54,198
[sighs] [imitating Michael] Uh, Buster,

415
00:17:54,281 --> 00:17:58,077
oh, um, it's about time you got here,
um, to the penthouse.

416
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,704
Did the skit start?
I don't have the hook thing.

417
00:18:00,788 --> 00:18:02,539
-[Michael] Hey, what's happening?
-Shh!

418
00:18:03,665 --> 00:18:06,293
Can I just do this
with my hand instead, Tobias?

419
00:18:06,376 --> 00:18:08,337
[in normal voice] Michael. I'm Michael.

420
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:11,173
Just stay in it, Murphy--
uh, Buster, stay in...

421
00:18:11,256 --> 00:18:13,467
He did a fantastic job as Buster

422
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:16,762
in the campaign interviews,
so I will get him there,

423
00:18:17,137 --> 00:18:18,806
uh, for the awards ceremony, I will.

424
00:18:18,889 --> 00:18:20,557
[stammering] He's a young actor.

425
00:18:20,641 --> 00:18:22,142
I don't really want to be an actor.

426
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:24,770
-It's not what I want to do.
-[imitating Michael] Oh, and, uh,

427
00:18:24,853 --> 00:18:27,314
who's making you be an actor, Buster?

428
00:18:27,397 --> 00:18:28,440
He's talking to you...

429
00:18:28,524 --> 00:18:30,984
[in normal voice] Shut up, Lindsay!
[stammers] Li-- your sister.

430
00:18:31,068 --> 00:18:33,487
Your sis... Lindsay-- sister.

431
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:35,572
[imitating Michael]
Who's making you be an actor?

432
00:18:35,656 --> 00:18:37,241
-My father?
-What?

433
00:18:37,324 --> 00:18:38,867
Who? Him?

434
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:40,577
How could you do this to our son?

435
00:18:40,661 --> 00:18:42,704
His son. Your son. I--
[in normal voice] Okay.

436
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:44,289
I have to pull myself out of this part.

437
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:47,209
[chuckles] I'm going in and out of Michael
like a cuckoo clock bird.

438
00:18:47,334 --> 00:18:50,295
Okay, so, I'm Michael,
uh, G.O.B. is G.O.B.,

439
00:18:51,213 --> 00:18:52,172
Michael is no one.

440
00:18:52,256 --> 00:18:54,591
And opening night energy, Places and re...

441
00:18:54,675 --> 00:18:57,469
-Peas and carrots. Red leather...
-[George Sr.] Tobias! Hey, hey!

442
00:18:57,553 --> 00:19:01,807
-We do not need a Buster, okay?
-That's right! Michael has him.

443
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:03,934
[imitating Michael] Indeed,
and here he comes.

444
00:19:04,017 --> 00:19:05,394
-Has who?
-Has who?

445
00:19:05,477 --> 00:19:06,562
[Lucille] Buster.

446
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:08,313
Y-You said you'd look after him.

447
00:19:09,314 --> 00:19:11,692
-That's the first I'm hearing about it.
-We've heard about it.

448
00:19:11,775 --> 00:19:14,820
Michael, why are you lying about
not having Buster with you?

449
00:19:14,903 --> 00:19:17,531
-Oh, no, I'm not lying about anything.
-[Ron] <i>Well, he kind of was.</i>

450
00:19:17,614 --> 00:19:20,826
<i>As months earlier,</i>
<i>he had laid out a scheme</i>

451
00:19:20,909 --> 00:19:23,579
<i>to make it seem like</i>
<i>Buster was a missing person.</i>

452
00:19:23,662 --> 00:19:26,790
So, we gotta wait about 48 hours
before we declare you missing.

453
00:19:26,874 --> 00:19:28,876
-Then they put out an APB.
-[Ron] <i>At which point,</i>

454
00:19:28,959 --> 00:19:31,253
<i>Buster was to go to the police station</i>
<i>and say...</i>

455
00:19:31,336 --> 00:19:32,838
"You were looking for me.
Here I am."

456
00:19:32,921 --> 00:19:35,299
Let them race back into town
and save everyone for a change.

457
00:19:35,382 --> 00:19:37,926
In fact, I keep forgetting to ask,
uh, what was it

458
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:41,722
that brought everyone back
together in town this time?

459
00:19:41,805 --> 00:19:43,932
Well, Lucille 2 was missing,

460
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:46,768
and we had an obligation
to look after the company.

461
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:49,104
-So, it's not because of Buster.
-[mumbling]

462
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:50,981
-I see. Listen, I don't...
-Yeah. [mumbling]

463
00:19:51,064 --> 00:19:53,192
[Ron] <i>What Michael didn't know</i>
<i>was that while the police</i>

464
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:54,943
<i>had gotten ahold of Buster...</i>

465
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:56,737
You think that's me?

466
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:58,405
<i>...they were more concerned</i>

467
00:19:58,488 --> 00:19:59,823
<i>with a different missing person.</i>

468
00:19:59,907 --> 00:20:02,743
I mean, that guy obviously
has a giant rubber hand,

469
00:20:02,826 --> 00:20:06,079
and I have a giant melted hand
that smells like Bounce.

470
00:20:06,163 --> 00:20:07,206
[giggles]

471
00:20:07,289 --> 00:20:08,832
[Buster over laptop] <i>I'm in the movie.</i>

472
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:10,834
Okay, that's definitely me.

473
00:20:10,918 --> 00:20:14,504
I'm just surprised to see it,
since I'm pretty sure I erased that video.

474
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:17,507
You sure you don't want an attorney?

475
00:20:17,591 --> 00:20:20,510
No. Michael was very clear about that.

476
00:20:20,594 --> 00:20:23,263
-I'm just a missing person.
-Not anymore.

477
00:20:23,347 --> 00:20:25,349
[officer] We don't need a bad cop.
Go home.

478
00:20:25,432 --> 00:20:27,142
-See your kid.
-Thanks, Rick.

479
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:28,435
That's why you're the good cop.

480
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:31,730
I don't know what lesson you're trying
to teach me, but you're back.

481
00:20:31,813 --> 00:20:34,691
You're probably hiding Buster.
I mean, who knows? It's just...

482
00:20:34,775 --> 00:20:36,485
Not my problem anymore,
in any event, okay?

483
00:20:36,568 --> 00:20:37,861
I got my own son to worry about.

484
00:20:37,945 --> 00:20:39,613
I am, uh, I'm leaving. Goodbye.

485
00:20:39,696 --> 00:20:41,156
-Bye.
-I will not be back this time.

486
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,658
It's all about my son.

487
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:45,118
That was so helpful, thank you.
If you could...

488
00:20:46,453 --> 00:20:48,413
-Get your stuff. Let's get out of here.
-Dad.

489
00:20:50,624 --> 00:20:52,334
-Hey. [chuckles]
-Oh!

490
00:20:53,585 --> 00:20:55,671
Hey. Hey, son.

491
00:20:55,754 --> 00:20:58,882
Oh, my goodness, look who it is.

492
00:20:58,966 --> 00:21:01,343
I was just gonna call you.
[clicks tongue] This is, uh...

493
00:21:01,426 --> 00:21:03,470
-Back in town or...?
-Are you, um...

494
00:21:03,553 --> 00:21:05,847
Briefly. You going
to the family thing that we're...

495
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:07,724
-Giving to ourselves? No.
-Huh? Yeah.

496
00:21:07,808 --> 00:21:09,685
-I, uh, can't make it.
-Yeah? No?

497
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:11,478
-Should I tell them?
-Well, you know, listen,

498
00:21:11,561 --> 00:21:13,939
I-I wasn't gonna go,
so don't-don't not go,

499
00:21:14,022 --> 00:21:15,023
because I'm... you know.

500
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:16,775
-You're the reason I <i>would </i>go.
-Oh, yeah?

501
00:21:16,858 --> 00:21:19,111
-I just have some plans, so I can't. Yeah.
 -Sweet.

502
00:21:19,194 --> 00:21:22,447
You got plans, huh?
Well, we make plans, and God laughs.

503
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:23,448
-That's right.
-Right?

504
00:21:23,532 --> 00:21:25,951
-No, I always want to make plans, but...
-Hmm.

505
00:21:26,368 --> 00:21:27,661
You don't want to be laughed at.

506
00:21:27,744 --> 00:21:29,997
Tell me. Yeah. Well, I won't laugh.

507
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,290
Do you have plans with Rebel?

508
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:34,835
-Uh, yeah, I do, yeah. I do. Yeah, no.
-Good for you guys.

509
00:21:34,918 --> 00:21:36,295
It's-it's fun stuff, yeah.

510
00:21:36,545 --> 00:21:39,339
Stuff I think, even if you weren't God,
you'd find funny.

511
00:21:39,423 --> 00:21:40,882
You can't ask for more than that.

512
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,385
But that's none of my business, yeah?

513
00:21:44,428 --> 00:21:46,930
Only reason I ask,
'cause I'm going on a scuba trip.

514
00:21:47,389 --> 00:21:50,017
Um, yeah,
came back in town to get my gear.

515
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:51,643
Only reason I'm here, um, you know.

516
00:21:51,727 --> 00:21:53,562
It's a last-minute thing.
Several weeks at sea.

517
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:55,397
-You'd hate it. So, yes.
-Yeah, not my thing.

518
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:57,983
-I shouldn't have even asked you.
-Oh, did you ask?

519
00:21:58,066 --> 00:22:00,110
Ah... I don't want to inter...

520
00:22:00,193 --> 00:22:02,237
You shouldn't cancel your plans
with Rebel, you know.

521
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:04,156
-Rain check.
-Uh, it's tomorrow or...?

522
00:22:04,239 --> 00:22:06,783
-Hmm? We leave today, so, yeah.
-Ah.

523
00:22:06,867 --> 00:22:08,201
[chuckles] God's probably--

524
00:22:08,285 --> 00:22:10,662
-I can almost hear him laughing, you know?
-Wow, yeah.

525
00:22:10,746 --> 00:22:13,373
Although, maybe, I imagine,
it doesn't make him laugh anymore.

526
00:22:13,457 --> 00:22:15,625
I mean, so much of life is, uh, plans.

527
00:22:15,709 --> 00:22:17,669
It would just be the same joke
over and over.

528
00:22:17,753 --> 00:22:18,837
So he's...

529
00:22:19,796 --> 00:22:21,882
-It's not funny anymore.
-What's he laughing at?

530
00:22:21,965 --> 00:22:23,800
Hey.

531
00:22:23,925 --> 00:22:25,260
You happy?

532
00:22:25,719 --> 00:22:26,636
Oh, man.

533
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:29,598
You know, in truth, it's, uh,

534
00:22:29,681 --> 00:22:31,808
it's-it's been a while since I've seen...

535
00:22:33,852 --> 00:22:35,937
-you, first of all, but, um...
-Yep.

536
00:22:36,021 --> 00:22:37,481
The thing with, um...

537
00:22:37,564 --> 00:22:39,316
So, Rebel, you know, 'cause she...

538
00:22:39,441 --> 00:22:42,152
I wanted to say, between the two of you,
you know,

539
00:22:42,694 --> 00:22:45,489
if you ever felt like...
Because, like, she's indicated

540
00:22:45,572 --> 00:22:47,616
that things were...
I don't know what she said,

541
00:22:47,699 --> 00:22:51,036
but maybe things were not quite
wrapped up completely with...

542
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:52,621
-Between me and her?
-Yeah.

543
00:22:54,331 --> 00:22:56,958
She said that I left things unfinished?
Hang on.

544
00:22:57,042 --> 00:23:00,670
That's got me, that's got me spinning out,
'cause, uh...

545
00:23:01,046 --> 00:23:03,090
That could be how she talks.
You know how she is.

546
00:23:03,173 --> 00:23:06,927
No, I-I think I was-was
pretty clear that I...

547
00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:08,220
You know, I broke up with her.

548
00:23:08,303 --> 00:23:12,182
You know, I show up there,
I got a cactus, for God's sakes,

549
00:23:12,265 --> 00:23:13,350
you know, which is...

550
00:23:13,433 --> 00:23:15,602
that's the universal sign
for "things are over."

551
00:23:15,685 --> 00:23:18,605
No, she must have just thought
that you would also, um...

552
00:23:20,565 --> 00:23:21,400
Say it.

553
00:23:21,483 --> 00:23:22,776
Yeah. Say it.

554
00:23:23,902 --> 00:23:26,321
Oh. Yeah, I did. I said lots of things.

555
00:23:26,822 --> 00:23:29,157
I'm standing there, you had just left.

556
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:30,409
-[Michael] Ciao.
-[George Michael] <i>Bella.</i>

557
00:23:31,326 --> 00:23:32,911
[Ron]<i> When Michael ran into Rebel</i>

558
00:23:32,994 --> 00:23:34,913
<i>-leaving her apartment...</i>
-That's for me.

559
00:23:34,996 --> 00:23:36,581
<i>...but she had some bad news.</i>

560
00:23:36,665 --> 00:23:40,001
It's not gonna work out between us.
I just wanted to tell you in person.

561
00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:43,338
[Ron] <i>Michael didn't know why he said</i>
<i>the next thing out of his mouth.</i>

562
00:23:43,422 --> 00:23:46,800
<i>Maybe it was relief</i>
<i>that he didn't have to break up with her,</i>

563
00:23:46,883 --> 00:23:49,219
<i>but for some reason, he came up with...</i>

564
00:23:49,678 --> 00:23:53,348
Well, if you ever change your mind,
I ain't going nowhere.

565
00:23:54,975 --> 00:23:59,312
Uh, I was afraid that maybe
I was too hard on her, verbally. You know?

566
00:23:59,396 --> 00:24:00,564
And then, I, you know...

567
00:24:00,647 --> 00:24:03,150
Plus I had to leave
for a couple of months for work.

568
00:24:03,233 --> 00:24:04,901
-Movie stuff?
-Hmm?

569
00:24:06,153 --> 00:24:07,279
Mexico.

570
00:24:07,737 --> 00:24:10,699
Hope she's not getting a signal
from you that you are not

571
00:24:11,199 --> 00:24:13,160
fully into her because you're worried

572
00:24:13,243 --> 00:24:14,995
that maybe I've got
some unfinished business,

573
00:24:15,078 --> 00:24:17,080
-so you're holding back?
-No. No, I'm all in.

574
00:24:17,164 --> 00:24:20,375
[Ron]<i> Actually,</i>
<i>the only contact George Michael had had</i>

575
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:23,170
<i>with Rebel was watching</i>
<i>one of her movies,</i>

576
00:24:23,253 --> 00:24:24,963
<i>with a Shane and three Noahs.</i>

577
00:24:25,046 --> 00:24:27,257
[Rebel] <i>And you can say goodbye to these!</i>

578
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:29,843
Maybe I do miss her.

579
00:24:30,177 --> 00:24:33,346
No, I told her. You know, I even said,
"Y'all are it for me."

580
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:35,348
-You know.
-Go a step further and say,

581
00:24:35,432 --> 00:24:37,184
-"Y'all ain't going nowhere."
-She's it. I don't know

582
00:24:37,267 --> 00:24:39,936
why she wouldn't think I was...
wasn't going nowhere.

583
00:24:40,604 --> 00:24:41,771
Pa.

584
00:24:41,897 --> 00:24:43,148
[elevator bell dings]

585
00:24:43,231 --> 00:24:45,358
Oh, that's me. Um, good.

586
00:24:45,442 --> 00:24:47,569
All right, well, are you going down or...?

587
00:24:47,652 --> 00:24:49,988
-No. I forgot my bag.
-Well, it's good to see--

588
00:24:50,071 --> 00:24:51,156
[both grunting]

589
00:24:57,287 --> 00:24:58,580
-Ciao.
<i>-Bella.</i>

590
00:25:05,337 --> 00:25:08,256
That's it, I'm out of here!

591
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:11,551
-[Ron] <i>Michael returns for his bag.</i>
-[all cheering]

592
00:25:11,635 --> 00:25:13,595
Okay, I get it.
Is that supposed to be me?

593
00:25:13,678 --> 00:25:15,847
No, that's my impression
of Tobias doing you.

594
00:25:15,931 --> 00:25:17,474
Wait, what? But that...

595
00:25:18,642 --> 00:25:21,144
Oh, that's it. I am out of here.

596
00:25:25,565 --> 00:25:27,776
Tobias doing Tobias. Yep?

597
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:31,363
I don't care. I'm...

598
00:25:31,863 --> 00:25:32,864
All right.

599
00:25:33,448 --> 00:25:38,119
[Ron] <i>And Buster wonders why Michael</i>
<i>isn't doing Michael.</i>

600
00:25:38,203 --> 00:25:40,330
Why hasn't Michael come back?

601
00:25:40,413 --> 00:25:43,291
What happened to
"Michael always comes back"?

602
00:25:43,917 --> 00:25:45,627
[gulps, groans]

603
00:25:46,211 --> 00:25:47,587
Oh, God. Oh, God.

604
00:25:48,296 --> 00:25:50,882
Mm. Uh... okay.
