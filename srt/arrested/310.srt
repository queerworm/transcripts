00:00:01,084 --> 00:00:02,710
narrator: NOW THE STORY 
OF A WEALTHY FAMILY

2
00:00:02,710 --> 00:00:04,379
WHO LOST EVERYTHING

3
00:00:04,379 --> 00:00:06,214
AND THE ONE SON 
WHO HAD NO CHOICE

4
00:00:06,214 --> 00:00:08,133
BUT TO KEEP THEM ALL TOGETHER.

5
00:00:13,596 --> 00:00:15,931
IT'S "ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT."

6
00:00:18,309 --> 00:00:21,020
MICHAEL HAD RECEIVED 
A WITNESS LIST

7
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:22,730
FOR HIS FATHER'S 
UPCOMING TRIAL.

8
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:23,939
- WHO'S ON THE LIST? 
ANY BLABBERS?

9
00:00:23,939 --> 00:00:25,608
- THEY'VE GOT ONE GUY 
WHO WON'T BE TALKING.

10
00:00:25,608 --> 00:00:28,569
THAT IS, UNLESS 
THERE'S A HAND INSIDE OF HIM.

11
00:00:28,569 --> 00:00:29,654
- OH, PLEASE, MICHAEL.

12
00:00:29,654 --> 00:00:31,406
EVEN THEN, 
I WOULDN'T SAY ANYTHING.

13
00:00:31,406 --> 00:00:32,448
- THAT'S REASSURING.

14
00:00:32,448 --> 00:00:34,159
BUT I WAS REFERRING 
TO GOB'S PUPPET FRANKLIN.

15
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:35,160
- YES!

16
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:36,369
I GOT HIM IN THE SYSTEM.

17
00:00:36,369 --> 00:00:37,578
- YOU DID THIS ON PURPOSE?

18
00:00:37,578 --> 00:00:38,579
- OH, YEAH.

19
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:41,499
HE IS RE-DYED, RESTED, 
AND READY TO WORK.

20
00:00:41,499 --> 00:00:42,875
OUGHTA BE A GOOD WAY 
TO GET SOME PRESS.

21
00:00:42,875 --> 00:00:44,294
OH, I GOTTA TELL FRANKLIN.

22
00:00:44,294 --> 00:00:45,920
- I THINK HE MEANT 
"GET FRANKLIN."

23
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,004
- AM I ON THE LIST?

24
00:00:47,004 --> 00:00:48,673
- WE ALL ARE. 
- FRANKLIN, GUESS WHAT.

25
00:00:48,673 --> 00:00:49,799
- BUT I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING.

26
00:00:49,799 --> 00:00:51,134
- HE HASN'T 
HEARD ANYTHING FROM ME.

27
00:00:51,134 --> 00:00:52,677
I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING.

28
00:00:52,677 --> 00:00:55,012
- WELL, YOU BOTH 
CERTAINLY ACT INNOCENT.

29
00:00:55,012 --> 00:00:57,182
narrator: 
BUSTER KNEW A GREAT DEAL.

30
00:00:57,182 --> 00:00:59,850
FOR LUCILLE ALMOST NIGHTLY 
GOT DRUNK AND TOLD HIM.

31
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:03,063
- YOUR FATHER SAYS HE WANTS ME 
TO GO ALL THE WAY TO FALLUJAH.

32
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:05,356
I THOUGHT HE MEANT 
THE SEX ACT

33
00:01:05,356 --> 00:01:07,733
THAT'S SO POPULAR 
WITH YOUR GENERATION.

34
00:01:07,733 --> 00:01:10,611
I KNOW YOU'RE AWAKE. 
FAKER!

35
00:01:10,611 --> 00:01:12,572
- MORE SIGNIFICANTLY, 
THEY'VE PUT AN N. BLUTH

36
00:01:12,572 --> 00:01:14,199
ON THE WITNESS LIST.

37
00:01:14,199 --> 00:01:15,866
- [as Franklin] I HOPE 
THAT DOESN'T STAND FOR

38
00:01:15,866 --> 00:01:16,992
WHAT I THINK IT STANDS FOR.

39
00:01:16,992 --> 00:01:18,494
[as Gob] WHOA! 
I DID NOT SAY THAT.

40
00:01:18,494 --> 00:01:19,620
- YOU DID, GOB. 
YOUR MOUTH MOVED.

41
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:20,705
YOUR HAND DIDN'T.

42
00:01:20,705 --> 00:01:23,291
- OH. WELL, 
I SHOULD WORK ON THAT.

43
00:01:23,291 --> 00:01:24,750
- IS THERE AN N. BLUTH 
IN THE FAMILY

44
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:26,043
THAT WE DON'T KNOW ABOUT?

45
00:01:26,043 --> 00:01:27,212
THEY SAY 
THERE'S BEEN MONEY FOUND

46
00:01:27,212 --> 00:01:28,713
IN AN ACCOUNT 
UNDER THAT NAME.

47
00:01:28,713 --> 00:01:30,089
- OF COURSE NOT.

48
00:01:30,089 --> 00:01:31,924
THE PROSECUTION 
IS TRYING TO TEST US,

49
00:01:31,924 --> 00:01:34,093
SEE IF WE'RE GONNA 
TURN AGAINST EACH OTHER.

50
00:01:34,093 --> 00:01:37,054
THEY MAKE STUFF UP. 
SHE DOESN'T EXIST.

51
00:01:37,054 --> 00:01:40,266
- YET YOU REFER TO HER 
AS A "SHE."

52
00:01:40,266 --> 00:01:41,976
- HE, SHE, 
WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE?

53
00:01:41,976 --> 00:01:43,603
- OH, HEAR! HEAR!

54
00:01:43,603 --> 00:01:47,190
IN THE DARK, 
IT ALL LOOKS THE SAME.

55
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:49,400
THEY'RE PROBABLY JUST TAKING 
A SHOT IN THE DARKNESS.

56
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:52,027
- BUT THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT 
JAN EAGLEMAN CALLED,

57
00:01:52,027 --> 00:01:55,323
AND SHE IS WILLING 
TO CONSIDER OUR CASE.

58
00:01:55,323 --> 00:01:58,284
- JAN EAGLEMAN? 
- SHE'S FROM THE JUSTICE TV.

59
00:01:58,284 --> 00:02:00,120
- NOT ANOTHER MEDIA WHORE.

60
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,830
YOU KNOW, FRANKLY, 
I THINK I CAN PUT TOGETHER

61
00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:03,873
A PRETTY GOOD DEFENSE.

62
00:02:03,873 --> 00:02:05,541
- OH, NO. HE THINKS 
HE'S A LAWYER AGAIN.

63
00:02:05,541 --> 00:02:07,168
narrator: DEVOTEES WILL REMEMBER 
THAT MICHAEL

64
00:02:07,168 --> 00:02:10,713
ONCE PLAYED A LAWYER 
IN A SCHOOL PLAY.

65
00:02:10,713 --> 00:02:12,798
- [singing] JUDGE, 
WON'T YOU THROW THE BOOK

66
00:02:12,798 --> 00:02:14,425
AT THE PIRATE.

67
00:02:14,425 --> 00:02:16,136
- YOU KNOW, MICHAEL, 
JUST BECAUSE YOU PLAYED A ROLE

68
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:17,178
DOESN'T MAKE IT REAL.

69
00:02:17,178 --> 00:02:20,055
- OF COURSE, BUSTER DID GROW UP 
TO BE CAPTAIN HOOK.

70
00:02:20,055 --> 00:02:21,056
- NOT COOL, MOM.

71
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:23,934
- OH, PLEASE. 
YOU'D BE A LOUSY ATTORNEY.

72
00:02:23,934 --> 00:02:25,478
THE FIRST PIECE OF EVIDENCE 
AGAINST US,

73
00:02:25,478 --> 00:02:27,104
YOU'D RUN FOR THE HILLS.

74
00:02:27,104 --> 00:02:29,732
NO, JAN IS INTERESTED. 
SHE CARRIES A LOT OF WEIGHT,

75
00:02:29,732 --> 00:02:32,067
AND SHE IS NOT 
CHARGING US ANYTHING.

76
00:02:32,067 --> 00:02:34,404
- [as Franklin] LIKE TO SEE 
A WHORE THAT DOES THAT!

77
00:02:34,404 --> 00:02:35,905
[as Gob] NOT THE 
"CARRYING THE WEIGHT" PART.

78
00:02:35,905 --> 00:02:38,241
BUT, ON THE OTHER HAND, 
IF IT'S FREE--

79
00:02:38,241 --> 00:02:40,285
- SHE WANTS US TO DO 
A MOCK TRIAL,

80
00:02:40,285 --> 00:02:42,077
SORT OF A DRY RUN 
JUST TO GET US READY.

81
00:02:42,077 --> 00:02:43,163
- WELL, I GUESS 
WE COULD ALL USE

82
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:44,372
SOME EXPERIENCE 
IN THE COURTROOM.

83
00:02:44,372 --> 00:02:45,373
FINE, I'LL GO CHECK HER OUT.

84
00:02:45,373 --> 00:02:46,707
BUT I'LL TELL YOU ALL RIGHT NOW,

85
00:02:46,707 --> 00:02:49,252
NO ONE IS GOING 
TO LIE ON THAT STAND.

86
00:02:49,252 --> 00:02:52,505
- AND NO ONE 
IS GONNA BETRAY THE FAMILY.

87
00:02:52,505 --> 00:02:53,589
- [humming]

88
00:02:53,589 --> 00:02:55,550
announcer: BUSTER WAS NERVOUS.

89
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:57,302
THAT'S WHAT ALL THE ROCKING 
AND HUMMING WAS ABOUT.

90
00:02:57,302 --> 00:03:02,265
AND MICHAEL MET WITH 
JUSTICE TV'S JAN EAGLEMAN

91
00:03:02,265 --> 00:03:04,058
WHO WAS CURRENTLY DOING 
A TECH REHEARSAL.

92
00:03:04,058 --> 00:03:05,810
- WE'RE DOING A TECH REHEARSAL 
FOR MY NEW SHOW:

93
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:06,894
JUDGE REINHOLD.

94
00:03:06,894 --> 00:03:08,646
IT'S A REALITY COURTROOM SHOW.

95
00:03:08,646 --> 00:03:10,440
- YOU KNOW THAT THERE'S 
AN ACTOR BY THAT NAME, RIGHT?

96
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,649
- THIS IS WHAT THEY PUT ME IN.

97
00:03:11,649 --> 00:03:12,900
WHY DID I LOSE ALL THE WEIGHT

98
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:14,277
IF THEY'RE GONNA 
PUT ME IN A POOL COVER?

99
00:03:14,277 --> 00:03:16,279
- I'M SORRY. 
ARE YOU AN ACTUAL JUDGE?

100
00:03:16,279 --> 00:03:18,656
- NO. 
THAT'S JUST A COINCIDENCE.

101
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:23,077
I READ SOMEWHERE JUDGE JUDY 
MADE $25 MILLION LAST YEAR.

102
00:03:23,077 --> 00:03:25,955
I'M, LIKE, HEY, 
I NEVER EVEN HEARD OF THE GUY.

103
00:03:25,955 --> 00:03:27,707
- SO YOU JUST-- 
YOU'RE DOIN' THIS

104
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:29,041
BECAUSE YOUR NAME IS JUDGE?

105
00:03:29,041 --> 00:03:30,418
- HONESTLY, THIS IS 
THE FIRST TIME

106
00:03:30,418 --> 00:03:31,961
I PUT THOSE TWO THINGS TOGETHER.

107
00:03:31,961 --> 00:03:33,796
- MAYBE WE SHOULD TAKE "JUDGE" 
OUT OF THE TITLE

108
00:03:33,796 --> 00:03:36,966
AND GO WITH MY ORIGINAL TITLE: 
MR. REINHOLD'S COURTROOM.

109
00:03:36,966 --> 00:03:39,802
NO, NO, NO. 
WE'RE CHANGIN' THE NAME.

110
00:03:39,802 --> 00:03:41,512
- THANKS, MICHAEL.

111
00:03:41,512 --> 00:03:44,224
I'VE GOT 250,000 
TALKING MAGAZINE ADS,

112
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:45,641
AND HE WANTS TO CHANGE THE NAME.

113
00:03:45,641 --> 00:03:47,685
- [Judge] MY NAME IS JUDGE.

114
00:03:47,685 --> 00:03:48,853
- HEAR YOU WANNA DO 
A MOCK TRIAL.

115
00:03:48,853 --> 00:03:49,895
- MMM. 
- YEAH?

116
00:03:49,895 --> 00:03:51,272
- AND WE CAN DO IT HERE 
ON THE SET.

117
00:03:51,272 --> 00:03:52,815
'CAUSE I'M LOOKING FOR 
JUDGE REINHOLD

118
00:03:52,815 --> 00:03:54,317
TO HAVE 
A LITTLE PRACTICE TOO.

119
00:03:54,317 --> 00:03:55,318
- UH-HUH.

120
00:03:55,318 --> 00:03:56,569
- I'LL BE ACTING 
AS THE PROSECUTOR.

121
00:03:56,569 --> 00:03:58,070
THAT WAY, I CAN SEE 
HOW YOUR FAMILY HOLDS UP.

122
00:03:58,070 --> 00:04:01,949
FAMILIES THAT DO WELL ARE 
THE ONES THAT STICK TOGETHER.

123
00:04:01,949 --> 00:04:04,744
- WELL, THAT'S--THAT'S US.

124
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:07,204
UM, WE ARE GOING TO NEED 
A DEFENSE ATTORNEY, RIGHT,

125
00:04:07,204 --> 00:04:08,248
FOR THE MOCK TRIAL?

126
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:09,874
AND THAT'S NOT GONNA BE CHEAP.

127
00:04:09,874 --> 00:04:11,709
- YOU KNOW THE CASE. 
WHY NOT YOU?

128
00:04:11,709 --> 00:04:14,420
[young Michael singing]

129
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:16,797
- YES, YEAH, 
GIVE ME A CHANCE TO SHOW MY DAD

130
00:04:16,797 --> 00:04:17,923
WHAT I CAN DO.

131
00:04:17,923 --> 00:04:20,801
I'LL-I'LL-I'LL SHOW HIM. 
I'LL MAKE A FOOL OUT OF HIM.

132
00:04:20,801 --> 00:04:23,053
[cell phone ringing] 
WHILE STICKING TOGETHER.

133
00:04:23,053 --> 00:04:24,138
EXCUSE ME ONE MINUTE.

134
00:04:24,138 --> 00:04:25,848
narrator: AND THAT'S 
WHEN MICHAEL FOUND OUT

135
00:04:25,848 --> 00:04:28,183
HIS BROTHER BUSTER 
WAS IN A COMA.

136
00:04:28,183 --> 00:04:29,560
- WHAT HAPPENED? 
HOW IS HE?

137
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,811
- WE'RE WAITING FOR THE DOCTOR.

138
00:04:30,811 --> 00:04:33,564
I JUST PRAY IT'S ONE OF THOSE 
THINGS WHERE HE'S UNCONSCIOUS

139
00:04:33,564 --> 00:04:35,316
THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE TRIAL,

140
00:04:35,316 --> 00:04:39,279
AND WHEN IT'S OVER HE WAKES UP 
AND GETS A BIG TOY.

141
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:40,655
- WAIT A MINUTE.

142
00:04:40,655 --> 00:04:42,323
ARE YOU RESPONSIBLE 
FOR THIS, MOM?

143
00:04:42,323 --> 00:04:43,658
DID YOU PUT ONE OF YOUR SONS 
INTO A COMA

144
00:04:43,658 --> 00:04:45,368
SO THAT HE CAN'T TESTIFY?

145
00:04:45,368 --> 00:04:47,077
- MICHAEL, HOW DARE YOU!

146
00:04:47,077 --> 00:04:50,122
OF COURSE, IT CROSSED MY MIND, 
BUT THIS WAS ALL BUSTER.

147
00:04:50,122 --> 00:04:52,542
HE GOT INTO 
YOUR BROTHER'S PILLS.

148
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:54,001
- NOT THE FORGET-ME-NOWS?

149
00:04:54,001 --> 00:04:55,961
- HE ASKED ME FOR THEM. 
I DIDN'T KNOW.

150
00:04:55,961 --> 00:04:57,212
I THOUGHT HE WAS DATING AGAIN.

151
00:04:57,212 --> 00:04:58,464
- HOPE YOU DON'T MIND ME SAYING,

152
00:04:58,464 --> 00:05:00,257
BUT THESE THINGS 
CAN GO ON INDEFINITELY.

153
00:05:00,257 --> 00:05:02,217
MY MOTHER'S BEEN IN THAT BED 
FOR TWO YEARS.

154
00:05:02,217 --> 00:05:04,762
- OH, HOW AWFUL!

155
00:05:04,762 --> 00:05:06,013
WE DON'T HAVE 
A PRIVATE ROOM.

156
00:05:06,013 --> 00:05:08,182
- THEY WON'T LET ME TAKE OUT 
HER FEEDING TUBE,

157
00:05:08,182 --> 00:05:09,434
AND I'M LUCKY.

158
00:05:09,434 --> 00:05:11,727
I HAVE THE RESOURCES 
TO PAY FOR THESE MEDICAL BILLS.

159
00:05:11,727 --> 00:05:13,103
- YOU HAVE RESOURCES?

160
00:05:13,103 --> 00:05:15,315
- WHAT GOOD IS MY MONEY IF 
I CAN'T BRING HER BACK?

161
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:16,732
- BUT YOU CAN'T.

162
00:05:16,732 --> 00:05:18,693
MONEY SHOULD BE SPENT 
ON DATING.

163
00:05:18,693 --> 00:05:19,860
IS THAT 
WHAT YOU WERE GONNA SAY?

164
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:21,529
- LET'S GO AHEAD 
AND WAIT OUTSIDE.

165
00:05:21,529 --> 00:05:24,198
- SO, YOU COME HERE OFTEN?

166
00:05:24,198 --> 00:05:25,616
CUTE BUTTON.

167
00:05:25,616 --> 00:05:26,742
- HOW IS HE?

168
00:05:26,742 --> 00:05:27,910
- WE'RE STILL WAITIN' 
TO FIND OUT.

169
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:29,745
- I GOT HERE 
AS SOON AS I COULD.

170
00:05:29,745 --> 00:05:31,497
OH, THE RED TAPE.

171
00:05:31,497 --> 00:05:34,083
- LOOKS A LITTLE BIT MORE 
LIKE RED PRAWN, DAD.

172
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:36,752
- IT'S THE SHRIMP FEST. 
OH, THE SHRIMP.

173
00:05:36,752 --> 00:05:38,379
- DO YOU REALIZE BUSTER'S 
PROBABLY IN THIS STATE

174
00:05:38,379 --> 00:05:40,005
BECAUSE OF YOU AND MOM?

175
00:05:40,005 --> 00:05:41,591
HE'S OBVIOUSLY AFRAID 
OF WHAT HE KNOWS,

176
00:05:41,591 --> 00:05:43,092
AND HE'S JUST TRYING TO FORGET.

177
00:05:43,092 --> 00:05:44,969
DOES HE KNOW WHO N. BLUTH IS?

178
00:05:44,969 --> 00:05:47,012
- RIGHT NOW, HE DOESN'T KNOW 
WHO B. BLUTH IS.

179
00:05:47,012 --> 00:05:48,931
- I'M GONNA NEED SOME REAL 
ANSWERS OUTTA YOU PRETTY SOON,

180
00:05:48,931 --> 00:05:50,349
BECAUSE I'VE JUST DISCUSSED IT 
WITH JAN.

181
00:05:50,349 --> 00:05:53,185
I AM GOING TO BE PRETENDING 
TO BE YOUR ATTORNEY

182
00:05:53,185 --> 00:05:55,145
AT THE MOCK TRIAL 
BEFORE JUDGE REINHOLD.

183
00:05:55,145 --> 00:05:56,481
- YOU'RE THE LAWYER?

184
00:05:56,481 --> 00:05:59,442
THAT'S THE SAME REPRESENTATION 
CAPTAIN HOOK HAD.

185
00:05:59,442 --> 00:06:00,860
[all laughing]

186
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:03,028
- IT'S SO GOOD TO LAUGH AGAIN.

187
00:06:03,028 --> 00:06:04,572
- OH, IT FEELS GOOD. 
- IT DOES.

188
00:06:04,572 --> 00:06:05,990
THEY SAY SEVEN MINUTES 
HEALS ALL WOUNDS.

189
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:08,367
- WAIT, NOT 
"THE JUDGE REINHOLD SHOW"

190
00:06:08,367 --> 00:06:09,952
FROM ALL THOSE MAGAZINE ADS?

191
00:06:09,952 --> 00:06:13,831
THEY'RE ALL OVER THE PLACE. 
LOOK AT THIS.

192
00:06:13,831 --> 00:06:15,666
- MY NAME IS JUDGE.

193
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:17,668
- I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW THAT 
THIS KIND OF TECHNOLOGY EXISTED.

194
00:06:17,668 --> 00:06:19,879
I COULD USE THIS 
IN MY VENTRILOQUISM ACT.

195
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:22,047
THERE A BAR HERE?

196
00:06:22,047 --> 00:06:26,385
- WELL, BUSTER'S IN WHAT WE CALL 
A LIGHT-TO-NO COMA.

197
00:06:26,385 --> 00:06:27,887
IN LAYMAN'S TERMS,

198
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:29,764
IT MIGHT BE CONSIDERED 
A VERY HEAVY NAP.

199
00:06:29,764 --> 00:06:31,557
- COULD THAT MEAN THAT 
HE'S FAKING IT?

200
00:06:31,557 --> 00:06:33,183
- OH, HIGHLY LIKELY 
THIS IS FAKE.

201
00:06:33,183 --> 00:06:35,352
ALTHOUGH, THERE DOESN'T SEEM 
TO BE VERY MUCH BRAIN ACTIVITY.

202
00:06:35,352 --> 00:06:36,771
-NO. THAT'S HIM.

203
00:06:36,771 --> 00:06:38,439
-I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT 
THAT WE REMEMBER

204
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:39,482
HE'S FULLY INSURED.

205
00:06:39,482 --> 00:06:41,191
I SAY WE SEE 
HOW THIS PLAYS OUT.

206
00:06:41,191 --> 00:06:42,234
- ABSOLUTELY.

207
00:06:42,234 --> 00:06:43,402
WE'RE GONNA BE HERE EVERY DAY.

208
00:06:43,402 --> 00:06:44,987
I DON'T CARE 
IF IT TAKES FROM NOW

209
00:06:44,987 --> 00:06:47,197
TILL THE END OF SHRIMP FEST.

210
00:06:47,197 --> 00:06:50,159
- WELL, IF THIS YOUNG MAN 
GETS BORED,

211
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:52,119
WE NEED A LOT OF VOLUNTEERS 
HERE AT THE HOSPITAL.

212
00:06:52,119 --> 00:06:54,413
TURNING OVER THE BEDRIDDEN, 
CHANGING BEDPANS.

213
00:06:54,413 --> 00:06:56,123
- OR THERE'S A MALL 
ACROSS THE STREET.

214
00:06:56,123 --> 00:06:57,625
- OH, YOU WANT EXCITEMENT?

215
00:06:57,625 --> 00:06:59,334
WELL, WE HAVE 
A GROUP OF YOUNG PEOPLE

216
00:06:59,334 --> 00:07:02,046
WHO PUT ON FAKE WEDDINGS 
FOR OUR ALZHEIMER'S PATIENTS.

217
00:07:02,046 --> 00:07:03,631
- IT ACTUALLY WOULD PROBABLY 
LOOK PRETTY GOOD

218
00:07:03,631 --> 00:07:05,508
ON SOME COLLEGE APPLICATIONS.

219
00:07:05,508 --> 00:07:07,384
- WOULD I HAVE TO TOUCH 
THE OLD PEOPLE?

220
00:07:07,384 --> 00:07:09,094
- ONLY THEIR HEARTS. 
YOU COULD BE A GROOM.

221
00:07:09,094 --> 00:07:10,805
BRING A LITTLE GIRLFRIEND 
UP THERE WITH YOU.

222
00:07:10,805 --> 00:07:13,974
- I DON'T HAVE A GIRLFRIEND. 
- SISTER THEN, OR A COUSIN.

223
00:07:13,974 --> 00:07:15,976
OF COURSE, 
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO KISS.

224
00:07:15,976 --> 00:07:17,687
narrator: GUESS WHO LIKED 
THAT IDEA?

225
00:07:17,687 --> 00:07:19,439
- HE SAYS HE DOESN'T 
WANT TO DO IT.

226
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:21,190
I'M ACTUALLY TRYING 
TO RESPECT HIS CHOICES LATELY.

227
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:24,610
- GREAT. I WAS JUST-- 
WELL, DON'T ANSWER FOR--

228
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:27,530
I, UM--YEAH, 'CAUSE I KNOW 
EXACTLY THE COUSIN.

229
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:29,449
I MEAN, THE GIRL.

230
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:31,617
I WOULD WANT TO GIVE, 
AND SHE'LL WANNA GIVE TOO.

231
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:35,455
AND WE'LL DO THAT TOGETHER 
FOR THEM, FOR THE SAKE OF--

232
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:39,249
IT'S A GREAT DAY...

233
00:07:39,249 --> 00:07:40,710
FOR BEING SAD.

234
00:07:42,002 --> 00:07:45,465
narrator: AND LATER, MICHAEL 
WAS PREPARING FOR HIS CASE.

235
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:46,924
- SO I'VE GOT A DATE 
WITH THE GUY

236
00:07:46,924 --> 00:07:48,342
WITH THE BRAIN-DEAD MOM.

237
00:07:48,342 --> 00:07:50,177
I MEAN, IT'S JUST 
A PICKET FOR THEM

238
00:07:50,177 --> 00:07:51,929
TO PULL THE PLUG 
ON OUR LOVED ONES.

239
00:07:51,929 --> 00:07:54,557
- GIVEN UP HOPE ON BUSTER 
PRETTY QUICKLY THERE, LINDSAY.

240
00:07:54,557 --> 00:07:57,602
- LISTEN, I KNOW BUSTER. 
I KNOW WHAT HE WANTS.

241
00:07:57,602 --> 00:07:59,269
- OH, I LOVE SOUP.

242
00:07:59,269 --> 00:08:00,896
IF THE ONLY THING I COULD DO 
WAS LAY IN BED ALL DAY

243
00:08:00,896 --> 00:08:02,106
AND EAT SOUP, 
I'D BE HAPPY.

244
00:08:02,106 --> 00:08:03,733
I WOULDN'T EVEN HAVE 
TO TASTE IT.

245
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:05,025
I COULD JUST 
TAKE IT THROUGH A TUBE.

246
00:08:05,025 --> 00:08:06,068
THAT WOULD ACTUALLY BE BETTER,

247
00:08:06,068 --> 00:08:09,489
'CAUSE I WOULDN'T EVEN 
BURN MY MOUTH.

248
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:11,907
NEVER LET ME DIE.

249
00:08:11,907 --> 00:08:13,951
- YEAH, HE WANTS OUT.

250
00:08:13,951 --> 00:08:16,579
ANYWAY, YOU AND I BOTH KNOW 
HE'S PROBABLY JUST FAKING.

251
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:18,914
- BUSY? 
- ACTUALLY, I'M--

252
00:08:18,914 --> 00:08:20,165
- CHECK THIS OUT. 
MY LIPS DON'T MOVE.

253
00:08:20,165 --> 00:08:21,876
YOU'LL CALL ME UP TO THE STAND, 
SAY SOMETHING LIKE,

254
00:08:21,876 --> 00:08:23,669
"WHO IS THIS LITTLE FRIEND?" 
AND HE'LL SAY:

255
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:25,254
- [Judge's voice] 
MY NAME IS JUDGE.

256
00:08:25,254 --> 00:08:26,589
- WHOSE NAME IS JUDGE?

257
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:27,965
- MY NAME IS-- 
- OKAY.

258
00:08:27,965 --> 00:08:29,049
- THAT'S A SILLY NAME.

259
00:08:29,049 --> 00:08:31,343
- THAT'S ENOUGH. 
- JUDGE. MY NAME...

260
00:08:31,343 --> 00:08:33,763
- YES, I AM JUDGING YOUR NAME. 
IT AM SILLY.

261
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:34,930
- IS-- 
- PLEASE STOP.

262
00:08:34,930 --> 00:08:36,348
- NOW YOU'RE CORRECTING 
MY GRAMMAR?

263
00:08:36,348 --> 00:08:38,017
- GOB, NOT GONNA PUT FRANKLIN 
ON THE STAND.

264
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:39,560
AND YOUR LIPS ARE MOVING 
JUST A LITTLE BIT.

265
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:40,561
- JUDGE.

266
00:08:40,561 --> 00:08:42,229
- HE'S RIGHT. 
HIS NAME IS JUDGE NOW.

267
00:08:42,229 --> 00:08:44,815
- YOU KNOW, I THINK DAD 
MIGHT ACTUALLY HAVE A CASE HERE.

268
00:08:44,815 --> 00:08:46,859
I MEAN, I AM CONCERNED 
ABOUT THIS N. BLUTH.

269
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:49,361
BUT IF IT IS INDEED 
JUST A PLOY ON THEIR PART,

270
00:08:49,361 --> 00:08:51,405
THEN THE ONLY 
BOMBSHELL THAT THEY'VE GOT

271
00:08:51,405 --> 00:08:54,283
IS A BLUEPRINT 
OF AN IRAQI MODEL HOME,

272
00:08:54,283 --> 00:08:57,537
THE SAME BLUEPRINT AS OURS 
WITH NO RECORD

273
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:58,871
THAT WE ACTUALLY 
GOT PAID FOR IT.

274
00:08:58,871 --> 00:09:01,040
ALTHOUGH, THIS IS STRANGE.

275
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,834
LOOKS LIKE THERE'S A SECRET ROOM 
IN THIS ONE OFF THE HALLWAY.

276
00:09:03,834 --> 00:09:05,044
I WONDER IF 
WE'VE GOT THAT.

277
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:06,546
I'M GONNA GO CHECK THAT OUT.

278
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:08,505
- OKAY, AND WE'RE GONNA 
GO BACK TO THE HOSPITAL.

279
00:09:08,505 --> 00:09:10,215
- YEAH, GOOD. 
CHECK ON BUSTER.

280
00:09:10,215 --> 00:09:12,843
WE DO NEED TO STICK TOGETHER 
AS A FAMILY ON THIS.

281
00:09:12,843 --> 00:09:15,012
- ACTUALLY, GONNA GO SWIPE 
SOME MORE TALKING MAGAZINES,

282
00:09:15,012 --> 00:09:16,889
BUT I'LL MAKE SURE 
TO POKE THE HEAD IN.

283
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:17,890
BYE.

284
00:09:19,183 --> 00:09:21,393
[knocking]

285
00:09:21,393 --> 00:09:24,146
narrator: AND MICHAEL FOUND 
THAT THERE WAS INDEED

286
00:09:24,146 --> 00:09:25,480
A SECRET ROOM,

287
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:28,275
WHERE HIS FATHER HAD STORED 
THE FAMILY MEMENTOES,

288
00:09:28,275 --> 00:09:31,361
INCLUDING HIS BIRTH CERTIFICATE.

289
00:09:31,361 --> 00:09:32,487
- NICHAEL BLUTH?

290
00:09:34,323 --> 00:09:37,117
AM I N. BLUTH?

291
00:09:37,117 --> 00:09:38,828
IS HE TRYING TO SET ME UP?

292
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:41,747
IF I'M N. BLUTH, 
I'M GOING TO PRISON.

293
00:09:41,747 --> 00:09:43,540
narrator: 
NICHAEL WAS WORRIED.

294
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:51,591
MICHAEL HAD JUST DISCOVERED 
A HIDDEN ROOM

295
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:55,094
IN THE MODEL HOME WHERE ALL 
THE FAMILY SECRETS WERE STORED.

296
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:58,513
- MY DAD'S TRYING TO PIN 
ALL OF HIS CRIMES ON N. BLUTH,

297
00:09:58,513 --> 00:10:00,307
AND I MIGHT BE N. BLUTH.

298
00:10:00,307 --> 00:10:01,475
- HUH.

299
00:10:01,475 --> 00:10:03,393
- THAT'S WHAT IT SAYS ACCORDING 
TO MY BIRTH CERTIFICATE.

300
00:10:03,393 --> 00:10:04,895
ALL OF OUR FAMILY RECORDS 
ARE UP HERE.

301
00:10:04,895 --> 00:10:05,980
- HMM.

302
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:07,022
- AND FOR SOME REASON,

303
00:10:07,022 --> 00:10:08,733
THIS STACK 
OF BODYBUILDING MAGAZINES.

304
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:09,817
- [chuckles]

305
00:10:09,817 --> 00:10:11,861
WELL, I GUESS YOUR DAD 
MUST'VE HAD THESE

306
00:10:11,861 --> 00:10:13,487
FROM WAY BACK WHEN, HUH?

307
00:10:13,487 --> 00:10:15,489
- MY NAME IS-- 
- THAT SEEMS KIND OF CURRENT.

308
00:10:15,489 --> 00:10:17,491
- OH! WHO AM I TRYING TO KID, 
MICHAEL?

309
00:10:17,491 --> 00:10:19,910
I WAS TRYING TO BEEF UP 
TO IMPRESS THAT WIFE OF MINE.

310
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:21,495
BUT NOW SHE'S AFTER 
SOME RICH GUY

311
00:10:21,495 --> 00:10:22,997
WHO'S TRYING TO KILL HIS MOM.

312
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:25,625
- I GOTTA GO TALK TO MY DAD. 
YOU COMIN' OUT?

313
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:28,085
- NO, NO, I HAVE 
TO FIGHT FOR MY WIFE.

314
00:10:28,085 --> 00:10:30,004
I'M GONNA KEEP 
MY MARRIAGE ALIVE.

315
00:10:31,505 --> 00:10:34,549
narrator: ONE ROOM OVER, 
GEORGE MICHAEL

316
00:10:34,549 --> 00:10:36,093
WAS ALSO TRYING 
TO CONVINCE SOMEONE

317
00:10:36,093 --> 00:10:37,845
TO PURSUE A FAKE MARRIAGE.

318
00:10:37,845 --> 00:10:39,471
- WE'D HAVE TO KISS.

319
00:10:39,471 --> 00:10:41,724
WOULDN'T THAT BE KIND OF WEIRD 
AFTER WHAT WE'VE BEEN THROUGH?

320
00:10:41,724 --> 00:10:43,142
- WELL, THAT WAS 
A LONG TIME AGO.

321
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:46,436
narrator: IT HAD BEEN TWO MONTHS 
SINCE THEY'D KISSED.

322
00:10:46,436 --> 00:10:48,605
- WELL, IT DOES SOUND LIKE 
A GOOD TWIST ON A WEDDING FILM.

323
00:10:48,605 --> 00:10:49,732
- A-A FILM?

324
00:10:49,732 --> 00:10:51,275
- WITHOUT THE CORNY 
"RUNAWAY BRIDE" BIT

325
00:10:51,275 --> 00:10:52,860
IN THE MIDDLE. 
- OH, YEAH.

326
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:54,069
narrator: AND 
SO, LIKE MANY PEOPLE

327
00:10:54,069 --> 00:10:56,405
WHO NO LONGER 
FELT ANYTHING FOR EACH OTHER,

328
00:10:56,405 --> 00:10:59,199
THEY DECIDED TO GET MARRIED.

329
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:02,577
- I'M N. BLUTH, AREN'T I? 
LEGALLY, THAT'S MY REAL NAME.

330
00:11:02,577 --> 00:11:04,288
YOU'VE BEEN DOING 
ALL THE IRAQ BUSINESS UNDER IT

331
00:11:04,288 --> 00:11:05,706
THINKING THAT 
IT WOULDN'T BE TRACEABLE.

332
00:11:05,706 --> 00:11:07,875
BUT IT IS, 
AND I'M GOING DOWN.

333
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:10,169
- FOR GOD'S SAKES, 
IT'S A TYPO, MICHAEL.

334
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:11,712
WHAT KIND OF FATHER 
DO YOU THINK I AM?

335
00:11:11,712 --> 00:11:13,756
THEY EVEN GOT 
YOUR BIRTH DATE WRONG.

336
00:11:13,756 --> 00:11:15,340
- THAT IS MY BIRTHDAY.

337
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:17,301
- IT'S CLOSE TO CHRISTMAS. 
WAS THAT HARD?

338
00:11:17,301 --> 00:11:19,678
IT'S A COINCIDENCE, MICHAEL.

339
00:11:19,678 --> 00:11:21,847
YOU'RE NOT N. BLUTH. 
THERE IS NO N. BLUTH.

340
00:11:21,847 --> 00:11:23,974
- I CALLED 
JAN EAGLEMAN ABOUT THIS,

341
00:11:23,974 --> 00:11:26,101
AND SHE SAYS 
IT SOUNDS PRETTY BAD.

342
00:11:26,101 --> 00:11:27,978
- YOU CALLED HER? 
SHE'S WITH THE PROSECUTION.

343
00:11:27,978 --> 00:11:29,063
- JUST FOR THE MOCK TRIAL.

344
00:11:29,063 --> 00:11:30,940
- YEAH, BUT 
WHAT IF SHE WASN'T?

345
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:33,776
YOU KNOW, I AM GLAD 
WE'RE HAVING THIS MOCK TRIAL,

346
00:11:33,776 --> 00:11:35,485
BECAUSE IT HAS SHOWN ME

347
00:11:35,485 --> 00:11:37,822
THAT YOU CANNOT BE INVOLVED 
IN THE REAL DEFENSE.

348
00:11:37,822 --> 00:11:39,114
- OH, COME ON.

349
00:11:39,114 --> 00:11:40,490
- WHY CAN'T YOU BE 
LIKE BUSTER?

350
00:11:40,490 --> 00:11:42,701
HE PUT HIMSELF IN A COMA 
TO PROTECT THIS FAMILY,

351
00:11:42,701 --> 00:11:44,661
POOR KID.

352
00:11:44,661 --> 00:11:46,663
I GOTTA GET DOWN THERE NOW.

353
00:11:46,663 --> 00:11:48,540
- SHRIMP FEST IS OVER, POP.

354
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:51,961
- REALLY? 
BETTER GO TO CHILI'S.

355
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:53,503
narrator: 
BACK AT THE HOSPITAL,

356
00:11:53,503 --> 00:11:56,006
LINDSAY HAD JOINED BRIAN 
IN PROTEST.

357
00:11:56,006 --> 00:11:58,342
- ALL THEY'RE DOING IN THERE 
IS TRYING TO KEEP PEOPLE ALIVE.

358
00:11:58,342 --> 00:12:01,303
- IT'S A LIFE MILL. 
- OH, HELLO, LINDSAY.

359
00:12:01,303 --> 00:12:02,805
I'D LIKE TO INTRODUCE YOU 
TO A FRIEND OF MINE

360
00:12:02,805 --> 00:12:04,056
THAT I MET AT THE GYM.

361
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:05,766
- HI. I'M FATHER BEN.

362
00:12:05,766 --> 00:12:09,937
- BEN IS A FRANCISCAN WHO CAN 
BENCH-PRESS OVER 200 POUNDS.

363
00:12:09,937 --> 00:12:12,314
AND HE TALKED ME 
INTO PROTESTING TOO.

364
00:12:12,314 --> 00:12:15,776
SHOW 'EM YOUR SIGN.

365
00:12:15,776 --> 00:12:17,527
NO, THE OTHER SIDE, 
'CAUSE THAT--

366
00:12:17,527 --> 00:12:19,738
- TOBIAS, BRIAN AND I 
BELIEVE IN THE DIGNITY

367
00:12:19,738 --> 00:12:21,281
OF EVERY HUMAN BEING.

368
00:12:21,281 --> 00:12:23,283
NOW, WHY DON'T WE LEAVE 
THE FRUITS WITH THE VEGETABLES

369
00:12:23,283 --> 00:12:25,202
AND GO GET A COFFEE?

370
00:12:25,202 --> 00:12:26,328
- DO SOME PUSHUPS.

371
00:12:26,328 --> 00:12:27,913
narrator: GEORGE MICHAEL 
AND MAEBY

372
00:12:27,913 --> 00:12:29,164
WERE ALSO AT THE HOSPITAL,

373
00:12:29,164 --> 00:12:33,002
PUTTING ON A WEDDING 
FOR THE ALZHEIMER'S PATIENTS.

374
00:12:33,002 --> 00:12:34,920
- AND NOW, 
THEY ARE TRULY FAMILY.

375
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:37,422
IT IS PERMANENT, 
ETERNAL.

376
00:12:37,422 --> 00:12:39,174
narrator: AND MAEBY 
DID THE THING

377
00:12:39,174 --> 00:12:41,218
SHE HAD ALWAYS THOUGHT 
WAS SO CORNY--

378
00:12:41,218 --> 00:12:43,678
- I CAN'T DO THIS. 
I CAN'T DO THIS.

379
00:12:43,678 --> 00:12:46,098
- BUT WE'RE NOT-- 
- WHAT AM I DOING?

380
00:12:46,098 --> 00:12:48,725
narrator: AND RAN AWAY.

381
00:12:48,725 --> 00:12:50,102
- WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?

382
00:12:50,102 --> 00:12:53,647
- JUST GIVE IT A MINUTE.

383
00:12:55,607 --> 00:12:57,026
NOW IT'S A BAR MITZVAH.

384
00:12:57,026 --> 00:12:59,444
narrator: 
AND AS GEORGE MICHAEL ACTED

385
00:12:59,444 --> 00:13:00,821
LIKE A BOY BECOMING A MAN,

386
00:13:00,821 --> 00:13:05,534
MICHAEL RETURNED TO HIS OFFICE 
TO FIND A MAN ACTING LIKE A BOY.

387
00:13:05,534 --> 00:13:06,701
- WHAT'S THIS?

388
00:13:06,701 --> 00:13:08,871
- JUST PRACTICING MY TESTIMONY. 
FAKE WITNESS BOX.

389
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:09,872
- AND YOU COULDN'T HAVE JUST

390
00:13:09,872 --> 00:13:11,248
TAKEN MY STUFF OFF 
THE DESK FIRST

391
00:13:11,248 --> 00:13:12,291
OR UNPLUGGED MY COMPUTER?

392
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:14,001
- JUSTICE IS SWIFT, MICHAEL.

393
00:13:14,001 --> 00:13:16,170
PLUS, WE NEED TO BE PREPARED 
FOR OUR TESTIMONY.

394
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:18,755
YOU'RE NOT DOING ANY OF THAT 
"MY NAME IS JUDGE" STUFF

395
00:13:18,755 --> 00:13:19,924
ON THE STAND, OKAY?

396
00:13:19,924 --> 00:13:21,926
- NO. THEY'RE ALL OUT OF 
MAGAZINES AT THE HOSPITAL.

397
00:13:21,926 --> 00:13:23,718
BESIDES, I'VE GOT A BETTER IDEA.

398
00:13:23,718 --> 00:13:25,095
narrator: WHICH HE GOT 
AT THE HOSPITAL.

399
00:13:25,095 --> 00:13:27,472
- PATIENT PRESENTED WITH 
GASTRIC BACTERIAL INFECTION

400
00:13:27,472 --> 00:13:30,184
COUPLED WITH PEPTIC ULCERS.

401
00:13:30,184 --> 00:13:32,477
TETRACYCLINE SHOULD NOT BE 
ADMINISTERED DUE TO ALLERGIES.

402
00:13:32,477 --> 00:13:34,021
- CHECK THIS OUT.

403
00:13:34,021 --> 00:13:35,439
YOU'LL SAY, 
"WHO'S THIS LITTLE FRIEND?"

404
00:13:35,439 --> 00:13:36,731
AND I'LL SAY, 
"WELL, HE'S NOT REALLY

405
00:13:36,731 --> 00:13:37,774
FEELING THAT WELL."

406
00:13:37,774 --> 00:13:38,817
AND YOU'LL SAY,

407
00:13:38,817 --> 00:13:40,277
"OH, WHAT'S WRONG WITH 
THE LITTLE GUY?"

408
00:13:40,277 --> 00:13:41,320
AND HE'LL SAY--

409
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:44,573
- PATIENT PRESENTED WITH 
GASTRIC BACTERIAL INFECTION.

410
00:13:44,573 --> 00:13:49,119
- WOW. SOUNDS LIKE YOU 
COULD USE SOME TRY-CYCLING.

411
00:13:49,119 --> 00:13:51,872
- TETRACYCLINE SHOULD NOT BE 
ADMINISTERED DUE TO ALLERGIES.

412
00:13:51,872 --> 00:13:53,373
- YOUR LIPS ARE STILL MOVING, 
AND--

413
00:13:53,373 --> 00:13:55,542
YOU STOLE 
THE DOCTOR'S TAPE RECORDER?

414
00:13:55,542 --> 00:13:57,836
- JUST THE TAPE. 
- I'M GIVING IT BACK TO HIM.

415
00:13:57,836 --> 00:13:59,838
- COME ON, MICHAEL! 
I NEED THIS!

416
00:13:59,838 --> 00:14:01,298
- GOB-- 
- MY CAREER NEEDS THIS.

417
00:14:01,298 --> 00:14:02,883
YOU KNOW WHAT? 
DAD WAS RIGHT.

418
00:14:02,883 --> 00:14:04,218
IF YOU REALLY CARED 
ABOUT THIS FAMILY,

419
00:14:04,218 --> 00:14:05,844
YOU'D BE 
MORE SUPPORTIVE OF ME IN THIS.

420
00:14:05,844 --> 00:14:07,387
- GOB, I'M NOT GONNA TURN 
THIS MOCK TRIAL

421
00:14:07,387 --> 00:14:09,806
INTO SOME KIND OF--

422
00:14:09,806 --> 00:14:11,308
- YOU WERE GONNA SAY MOCKERY, 
WEREN'T YOU?

423
00:14:11,308 --> 00:14:12,935
- I WAS IN TROUBLE, LIKE, 
THREE WORDS INTO THAT.

424
00:14:12,935 --> 00:14:15,104
narrator: SO MICHAEL 
WENT BACK TO THE HOSPITAL

425
00:14:15,104 --> 00:14:19,108
WHEN HE HAD A VISIT 
FROM THE REAL PROSECUTOR.

426
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:20,734
- WAYNE, 
WHAT ARE YOU DOIN' HERE?

427
00:14:20,734 --> 00:14:22,945
- WE HEARD ABOUT THE TRIAL. 
WE WANNA MAKE A DEAL WITH YOU.

428
00:14:22,945 --> 00:14:25,155
- A DEAL? 
IT'S A MOCK TRIAL.

429
00:14:25,155 --> 00:14:26,991
- READ THE PATRIOT ACT.

430
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:29,326
ANYTHING SAID IN A MOCK TRIAL 
OR DAYTIME COURTROOM SHOW

431
00:14:29,326 --> 00:14:31,203
CAN BE USED IN ANY REAL 
CRIMINAL PROCEEDING

432
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:34,123
OR PRIME-TIME PROCEDURAL SHOW 
SUBJECT TO THE INTERPRETATION

433
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:36,541
OF THE PRESIDING JUDGE 
OR THE EXECUTIVE PRODUCER.

434
00:14:36,541 --> 00:14:38,627
- IN OUR CASE, 
JUDGE REINHOLD IS BOTH.

435
00:14:38,627 --> 00:14:40,170
- DID HE GET E.P.? 
- SURE DID.

436
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:42,089
- GOOD FOR HIM. ANYWAY, 
YOU PUT YOUR DAD ON THE STAND,

437
00:14:42,089 --> 00:14:44,549
GET HIM TALKING, 
AND YOU GET FULL IMMUNITY.

438
00:14:44,549 --> 00:14:46,593
IF YOU DON'T DO IT, 
WE'RE GONNA GO AFTER N. BLUTH,

439
00:14:46,593 --> 00:14:47,928
AND WE THINK THAT'S YOU.

440
00:14:47,928 --> 00:14:50,055
- YOU'RE ASKING ME TO CONSPIRE 
AGAINST MY OWN CLIENT.

441
00:14:50,055 --> 00:14:51,390
COULDN'T YOU 
GO TO JAIL FOR THAT?

442
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:54,935
- THINK ABOUT IT, MICHAEL. 
IT MAY BE TIME TO CUT AND RUN.

443
00:14:54,935 --> 00:14:57,771
- WE DON'T DO THAT 
IN MY FAMILY.

444
00:15:03,652 --> 00:15:06,155
narrator: MAEBY HAD JUST 
RUN AWAY FROM A FAKE WEDDING

445
00:15:06,155 --> 00:15:08,198
THAT HAD GOTTEN 
A LITTLE TOO REAL.

446
00:15:08,198 --> 00:15:09,199
[knocking]

447
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:10,617
- OH, YOU KNOW ABOUT 
THIS ROOM TOO?

448
00:15:10,617 --> 00:15:12,494
- YEAH, IT'S MY DAD'S 
EXERCISE ROOM.

449
00:15:12,494 --> 00:15:14,788
narrator: ALTHOUGH, 
FOR ALL HER WORLDLINESS,

450
00:15:14,788 --> 00:15:17,207
MAEBY WAS STILL 
A CHILD IN MANY WAYS.

451
00:15:17,207 --> 00:15:19,960
- YEAH, I-I COME HERE 
TO THINK MYSELF SOMETIMES,

452
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,086
BUT I ALWAYS KNOCK FIRST.

453
00:15:21,086 --> 00:15:22,212
I-I ALWAYS DO THAT.

454
00:15:22,212 --> 00:15:23,923
I ALWAYS DO THAT ANYWAY, 
NO MATTER WHAT ROOM.

455
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:26,675
- SO WHAT HAPPENED BACK THERE? 
- I DON'T KNOW.

456
00:15:26,675 --> 00:15:28,593
I GUESS I JUST GOT 
A LITTLE WEIRDED OUT.

457
00:15:28,593 --> 00:15:31,221
I MEAN, WE'RE COUSINS. 
IT'S WRONG.

458
00:15:31,221 --> 00:15:32,806
- WELL, YOU KNOW, 
THE TORAH TELLS US

459
00:15:32,806 --> 00:15:34,891
THAT THE LARGER WRONG 
IS TO PUT OUR OWN FEELINGS

460
00:15:34,891 --> 00:15:36,643
BEFORE THE COMMITMENTS 
WE'VE MADE,

461
00:15:36,643 --> 00:15:38,562
YOU KNOW, TOWARDS THE SICK, 
AGED, AND GROSS.

462
00:15:38,562 --> 00:15:39,896
narrator: THAT'S NOT 
IN THE TORAH.

463
00:15:39,896 --> 00:15:41,273
- AND, I MEAN, YOU KNOW,

464
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:43,108
WE WEREN'T THERE 
FOR OURSELVES TODAY.

465
00:15:43,108 --> 00:15:44,693
WE WERE THERE 
TO BRING HAPPINESS TO OTHERS.

466
00:15:44,693 --> 00:15:49,239
AND I JUST--I JUST FEEL NOW 
LIKE WE LEFT

467
00:15:49,239 --> 00:15:51,700
A LOT OF OLD PEOPLE 
SAD THERE TODAY.

468
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:53,743
narrator: AGAIN, NOT TRUE.

469
00:15:53,743 --> 00:15:56,663
[singing and clapping]

470
00:15:58,915 --> 00:16:00,667
- I MEAN, YOU KNOW, 
I'M NOT SAYING

471
00:16:00,667 --> 00:16:02,377
IT'S NOT WEIRD 
FOR ME TOO.

472
00:16:02,377 --> 00:16:03,712
I'M JUST SAYING 
MAYBE WE COULD

473
00:16:03,712 --> 00:16:04,754
TAKE THOSE WEIRD FEELINGS

474
00:16:04,754 --> 00:16:06,631
AND TURN THEM 
INTO SOMETHING POSITIVE.

475
00:16:06,631 --> 00:16:08,925
narrator: 
HE REALLY WANTED THAT KISS.

476
00:16:08,925 --> 00:16:10,385
- I MEAN, I GUESS IT WOULD BE 
A GOOD WAY

477
00:16:10,385 --> 00:16:11,428
TO FREAK OUT OUR PARENTS.

478
00:16:11,428 --> 00:16:14,098
- LET'S FREAK THEM OUT.

479
00:16:14,098 --> 00:16:15,975
- HEY, YOU GUYS KNOW 
ABOUT THIS ROOM TOO, HUH?

480
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:17,809
I'M JUST LOOKIN' 
FOR SOME EVIDENCE

481
00:16:17,809 --> 00:16:22,897
FOR MY TRIAL AGAINST POP-POP-- 
FOR POP-POP.

482
00:16:22,897 --> 00:16:23,898
- I MEAN, SERIOUSLY, DOCTOR,

483
00:16:23,898 --> 00:16:25,650
WHEN ARE WE GOING TO 
KNOW SOMETHING?

484
00:16:25,650 --> 00:16:27,027
I'M TRYIN' TO 
GET ON WITH MY LIFE.

485
00:16:27,027 --> 00:16:28,778
YEAH, SO IS 
WHAT REMAINS OF BUSTER.

486
00:16:28,778 --> 00:16:30,697
- DR. FARMER, 
THERE'S A PROBLEM IN 302.

487
00:16:30,697 --> 00:16:32,116
THE PATIENT'S HAVING 
A BAD REACTION

488
00:16:32,116 --> 00:16:33,200
TO THE TETRACYCLINE.

489
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:36,328
- TETRACYCLINE? DIDN'T I SAY 
NOT TO GIVE HIM THAT?

490
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:38,038
DIDN'T YOU LISTEN TO MY NOTES?

491
00:16:38,038 --> 00:16:40,749
- [Gob singing] 
IT AIN'T EASY BEIN' WHITE.

492
00:16:40,749 --> 00:16:42,959
IT AIN'T EASY.

493
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:45,212
- I'M TRYING TO GET ON WITH 
MY LIFE, AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

494
00:16:45,212 --> 00:16:46,296
YOU CAN'T DEAL WITH IT.

495
00:16:46,296 --> 00:16:48,465
- NO, I CAN'T, LINDSAY. 
- YOU'RE NOT INTERESTED IN ME.

496
00:16:48,465 --> 00:16:49,966
- AND YOU'RE NOT CAPABLE 
OF INTIMACY.

497
00:16:49,966 --> 00:16:52,802
- WELL, JUST FAKE IT!

498
00:16:52,802 --> 00:16:54,929
COMA.

499
00:16:54,929 --> 00:16:56,140
narrator: AND, 
BELIEVE IT OR NOT,

500
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:58,725
THAT ACTUALLY 
GOT THROUGH TO THEM.

501
00:16:58,725 --> 00:17:01,520
- NOW, WILL YOU PLEASE 
TURN ON THE CARTOON NETWORK

502
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,230
AND GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE?

503
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:04,648
narrator: AND THE NEXT DAY,

504
00:17:04,648 --> 00:17:07,776
THE MOCK TRIAL BEGAN, 
AS DID THE MOCK EPISODE

505
00:17:07,776 --> 00:17:09,986
OF WHAT HAD 
NOW BEEN RENAMED

506
00:17:09,986 --> 00:17:12,406
"MOCK TRIAL WITH J. REINHOLD."

507
00:17:12,406 --> 00:17:15,700
- TAKE ONE. 
IN FIVE, FOUR, THREE--

508
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:18,120
- [singing] MOCK TRIAL 
WITH J. REINHOLD

509
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:20,414
MOCK TRIAL 
WITH J. REINHOLD

510
00:17:21,706 --> 00:17:23,917
MOCK TRIAL 
WITH J. REINHOLD

511
00:17:23,917 --> 00:17:26,170
MOCK TRIAL!

512
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:28,338
- ALL RISE FOR 
ACTING'S HIGHEST HONOR,

513
00:17:28,338 --> 00:17:30,590
JUDGE REINHOLD!

514
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:32,509
JUDGE REINHOLD 
IS NEITHER A REAL JUDGE,

515
00:17:32,509 --> 00:17:34,303
NOR HAS HE RECEIVED 
ACTING'S HIGHEST HONOR.

516
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:37,722
- WOW. THANK YOU.

517
00:17:37,722 --> 00:17:40,350
THAT'S THE FIRST TIME 
I EVER GOT A STANDING OVATION

518
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:43,437
BEFORE THE SHOW.

519
00:17:43,437 --> 00:17:44,854
THEY'RE NOT CLAPPING.

520
00:17:44,854 --> 00:17:46,356
- THEY DON'T IN A COURTROOM.

521
00:17:46,356 --> 00:17:48,192
- PLEASE BE SEATED.

522
00:17:48,192 --> 00:17:50,485
narrator: 
THE PROCEEDINGS GOT UNDER WAY,

523
00:17:50,485 --> 00:17:52,112
AND THE BLUTHS 
SET ABOUT PRETENDING

524
00:17:52,112 --> 00:17:54,364
THEY WERE A FAMILY 
THAT STAYS TOGETHER.

525
00:17:54,364 --> 00:17:56,616
- YOU NEVER HEARD ANYONE 
IN YOUR FAMILY DISCUSS PLANS

526
00:17:56,616 --> 00:18:00,036
TO EITHER TRAVEL TO IRAQ 
OR DO BUSINESS THERE?

527
00:18:00,036 --> 00:18:04,916
- WELL, I SPEND SO MUCH TIME 
MAKING SWEET LOVE ON MY WIFE

528
00:18:04,916 --> 00:18:06,668
THAT IT'S HARD TO HEAR ANYTHING

529
00:18:06,668 --> 00:18:09,254
OVER THE CLATTER 
OF HER BREASTS AND--

530
00:18:09,254 --> 00:18:11,256
- YOUR WITNESS. 
- I HAVE NOTHING.

531
00:18:11,256 --> 00:18:13,133
[bass guitar sliding]

532
00:18:13,133 --> 00:18:15,969
- OH, HOW SHOULD I KNOW 
WHERE THE MONEY COMES FROM?

533
00:18:15,969 --> 00:18:17,679
I JUST KNOW WHERE IT GOES,

534
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:21,057
TO TAKING CARE OF 
MY POOR COMATOSE SON.

535
00:18:21,057 --> 00:18:25,312
AND IF THIS WERE THE REAL TRIAL, 
I'D CRY HERE.

536
00:18:25,312 --> 00:18:27,772
- I'M SAVING 
MY GOOD STUFF TOO.

537
00:18:27,772 --> 00:18:28,940
- I HAVE NO CROSS AT THIS TIME.

538
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:31,526
- THIS IS WHY YOU'RE NOT 
HANDLING MY REAL DEFENSE.

539
00:18:31,526 --> 00:18:34,028
- I HAVE ONE WITNESS, DAD, 
AND HE'LL CLEAR EVERYTHING UP.

540
00:18:34,028 --> 00:18:35,864
- narrator: 
GOB HAD A LITTLE TROUBLE.

541
00:18:35,864 --> 00:18:37,824
- STATE YOUR NAME.

542
00:18:37,824 --> 00:18:39,493
- [Judge's voice] 
MY NAME IS JUDGE.

543
00:18:39,493 --> 00:18:42,371
- WHAT KIND OF NAME IS THAT, 
MAGAZINE?

544
00:18:42,371 --> 00:18:44,123
- I'M JUST GONNA GO AHEAD 
AND JUMP IN RIGHT HERE.

545
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:45,374
I HAVE NOTHING FOR HIM.

546
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:46,875
[bass string sliding]

547
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:48,668
narrator: BUT NOW, 
IT WAS MICHAEL'S TURN.

548
00:18:48,668 --> 00:18:49,919
- WELL, LISTEN, 
HAVE FUN OUT THERE,

549
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:51,045
BECAUSE THIS IS THE LAST TIME

550
00:18:51,045 --> 00:18:52,547
YOU'RE GONNA SEE 
THIS SIDE OF A COURTROOM

551
00:18:52,547 --> 00:18:55,592
TILL YOUR SECOND WIFE 
DIVORCES YOUR FRECKLED ASS.

552
00:18:55,592 --> 00:18:56,760
- LOOK AT THAT.

553
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:58,387
YOU JUST BLEW 
YOUR WEDDING SPEECH.

554
00:18:58,387 --> 00:19:00,389
I'D LIKE TO JUMP RIGHT AHEAD 
TO CALLING A SURPRISE WITNESS.

555
00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:03,892
- ONLY WITNESSES ON THE LIST. 
- OH, HE'S ON THE LIST.

556
00:19:03,892 --> 00:19:08,021
- I WOULD LIKE TO CALL 
TO THE STAND

557
00:19:08,021 --> 00:19:11,024
FRANKLIN DELANO BLUTH.

558
00:19:11,024 --> 00:19:12,484
- YOU'RE CALLIN' FRANKLIN, 
MIKEY?

559
00:19:12,484 --> 00:19:13,485
- I SURE AM, PAL.

560
00:19:13,485 --> 00:19:16,821
I SUPPORT MY BROTHER.

561
00:19:16,821 --> 00:19:18,865
- [singing] 
IT AIN'T EASY BEIN' WHITE

562
00:19:18,865 --> 00:19:21,785
IT AIN'T EASY BEIN' BROWN.

563
00:19:21,785 --> 00:19:26,540
YOU'RE MY BRO, 
YOU'RE MY BROTHER

564
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:27,832
- YOUR HONOR, 
THIS IS HIGHLY UNUSUAL.

565
00:19:27,832 --> 00:19:30,377
- WELL, I'M VERY CURIOUS 
TO SEE WHERE THIS IS GOING.

566
00:19:30,377 --> 00:19:31,628
I'M GONNA ALLOW IT.

567
00:19:31,628 --> 00:19:33,004
BUT I'M WARNING YOU, 
MR. BLUTH,

568
00:19:33,004 --> 00:19:35,131
THIS BETTER MAKE 
FOR A GOOD PROMO.

569
00:19:35,131 --> 00:19:38,051
- I WAS APPROACHED BY 
THE REAL PROSECUTION RECENTLY

570
00:19:38,051 --> 00:19:40,762
AND WAS ASKED IF I WOULD 
BE WILLING TO TURN ON MY FAMILY

571
00:19:40,762 --> 00:19:42,639
AND SAVE MYSELF.

572
00:19:42,639 --> 00:19:44,891
WOULD YOU PLEASE 
PRESS THE PLAY BUTTON

573
00:19:44,891 --> 00:19:47,977
ON THE TAPE RECORDER 
INSIDE THE PUPPET?

574
00:19:47,977 --> 00:19:49,979
- IF YOU DON'T DO IT, 
WE'RE GONNA GO AFTER N. BLUTH,

575
00:19:49,979 --> 00:19:51,064
AND WE THINK THAT'S YOU.

576
00:19:51,064 --> 00:19:53,107
- YOU'RE ASKING ME TO CONSPIRE 
AGAINST MY OWN CLIENT.

577
00:19:53,107 --> 00:19:56,110
- WHY DO THERE HAVE 
TO BE PUPPETS LIKE FRANK?

578
00:19:56,110 --> 00:19:57,362
- THINK ABOUT IT, MICHAEL.

579
00:19:57,362 --> 00:19:59,906
- WELL, IT LOOKS LIKE 
WE'VE GOT A MISTRIAL.

580
00:19:59,906 --> 00:20:02,742
BUT ON THE PLUS SIDE, 
WE'VE ALSO GOT A HUNG JURY.

581
00:20:02,742 --> 00:20:03,952
HIT IT!

582
00:20:03,952 --> 00:20:06,162
- MOCK TRIAL 
WITH J. REINHOLD

583
00:20:07,331 --> 00:20:09,583
MOCK TRIAL 
WITH J. REINHOLD

584
00:20:10,625 --> 00:20:12,877
MOCK TRIAL 
WITH J. REINHOLD

585
00:20:12,877 --> 00:20:14,504
- YOU DID GOOD OUT THERE, 
MICHAEL.

586
00:20:14,504 --> 00:20:16,298
BUT IT'S JUST A MOCK TRIAL.

587
00:20:16,298 --> 00:20:17,799
WHY DON'T YOU JUST 
TAKE IT TO THE GRAND JURY?

588
00:20:17,799 --> 00:20:19,801
- WANTED TO PROVE TO YOU 
THAT I COULD DO IT.

589
00:20:19,801 --> 00:20:22,387
I'M GOING TO A GRAND JURY 
WITH THAT NOW.

590
00:20:22,387 --> 00:20:24,389
narrator: ACTUALLY, 
MICHAEL HAD NO IDEA

591
00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:26,391
THAT'S WHAT HE WAS 
SUPPOSED TO DO.

592
00:20:26,391 --> 00:20:28,059
- NICE JOB. 
YOU HAVE A REAL SHOT.

593
00:20:28,059 --> 00:20:30,103
YOU ALL STUCK TOGETHER, 
AND THAT'S WHAT WINS CASES.

594
00:20:30,103 --> 00:20:32,063
- WE DON'T ABANDON EACH OTHER.

595
00:20:32,063 --> 00:20:34,733
- NO ONE'S CLOSER 
THAN THE BLUTH FAMILY.

596
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:35,775
narrator: THEY WERE.

597
00:20:35,775 --> 00:20:38,570
- I NOW PRONOUNCE YOU 
HUSBAND AND WIFE.

598
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:40,322
narrator: FOR AS IT TURNS OUT,

599
00:20:40,322 --> 00:20:42,699
THE FAKE PRIEST WAS CALLED 
TO A PATIENT'S ROOM,

600
00:20:42,699 --> 00:20:47,329
AND FATHER BEN FILLED IN, 
NOT KNOWING IT WAS FAKE.

601
00:20:47,329 --> 00:20:49,414
AND THAT'S HOW 
THE KIDS GOT MARRIED.

602
00:20:49,414 --> 00:20:52,959
ON THE NEXT 
"ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT."

603
00:20:52,959 --> 00:20:55,462
- "MOCK TRIAL WITH J. REINHOLD" 
LEADS TO IMITATORS.

604
00:20:55,462 --> 00:20:57,797
- ALL RISE. 
BUD CORT IS NOW IN SESSION.

605
00:20:57,797 --> 00:20:59,633
- PLEASE BE SEATED.

606
00:20:59,633 --> 00:21:03,345
- HARD TO SIT WHEN YOU GOT 
SOMEONE'S HAND UP YOUR ASS.

607
00:21:03,345 --> 00:21:05,764
- ALL RIGHT, 
LET'S LOSE THE PUPPET.

608
00:21:05,764 --> 00:21:08,933
narrator: AND MICHAEL DISCOVERS 
THAT HE WASN'T N. BLUTH

609
00:21:08,933 --> 00:21:11,770
AFTER ALL.

610
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:13,855
- I HAVE AN OLDER SISTER?

611
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:16,525
narrator: SO MUCH FOR 
NOT ABANDONING FAMILY.
