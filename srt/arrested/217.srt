1
00:00:01,401 --> 00:00:02,722
- NOW THE STORY 
OF A WEALTHY FAMILY

2
00:00:02,722 --> 00:00:04,204
WHO LOST EVERYTHING,

3
00:00:04,204 --> 00:00:05,845
AND THE ONE SON 
WHO HAD NO CHOICE

4
00:00:05,845 --> 00:00:07,567
BUT TO KEEP THEM ALL TOGETHER.

5
00:00:13,653 --> 00:00:14,814
IT'S "ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT."

6
00:00:18,418 --> 00:00:21,901
MICHAEL BLUTH HAD SET UP 
A MEETING WITH CAL CULLEN,

7
00:00:21,901 --> 00:00:23,623
OWNER OF ONE OF THE LARGEST 
PARCELS OF LAND

8
00:00:23,623 --> 00:00:24,704
IN ORANGE COUNTY.

9
00:00:24,704 --> 00:00:26,146
- I HOPE THAT I CAN PROVE TO YOU

10
00:00:26,146 --> 00:00:28,028
THAT WE HAVE 
A VERY IMPRESSIVE COMPANY.

11
00:00:28,028 --> 00:00:30,190
- WELL, YOUR FAMILY 
DID NOT COME OFF WELL

12
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:32,312
ON LAST NIGHT'S "SCANDALMAKERS."

13
00:00:32,312 --> 00:00:33,873
- "SCANDALMAKERS" WAS A SHOW

14
00:00:33,873 --> 00:00:36,476
THAT REENACTED 
HEADLINE-GRABBING STORIES.

15
00:00:36,476 --> 00:00:38,758
THE LATEST WAS 
ABOUT THE BLUTH FAMILY,

16
00:00:38,758 --> 00:00:41,041
THE RIGHTS OF WHICH HAD BEEN 
SIGNED AWAY BY TOBIAS

17
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:43,723
IN EXCHANGE FOR THE PART 
OF GEORGE SR.

18
00:00:43,723 --> 00:00:47,807
- WHEN ALLEGATIONS SURFACED HE'D 
ILLEGALLY BUILT HOMES IN IRAQ,

19
00:00:47,807 --> 00:00:51,050
GEORGE BLUTH SR., ASSISTED 
BY HIS SECRETARY, KITTY,

20
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:52,612
ESCAPED THE COUNTRY.

21
00:00:52,612 --> 00:00:54,334
- DUE TO POOR ACTING,

22
00:00:54,334 --> 00:00:56,856
THE BURDEN OF THE STORY 
WAS PLACED ON THE NARRATOR.

23
00:00:56,856 --> 00:01:00,740
- ONLY TO BE FOUND HIDING UNDER 
ONE OF THE HOMES THAT HE BUILT.

24
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:03,263
- HE WAS ACTUALLY FOUND 
IN A HOLE NEAR THE HOUSE,

25
00:01:03,263 --> 00:01:05,905
BUT THIS INATTENTION 
TO DETAIL WAS TYPICAL

26
00:01:05,905 --> 00:01:08,148
OF THE LAZINESS THE 
SHOW'S NARRATOR WAS KNOWN FOR.

27
00:01:08,148 --> 00:01:10,070
- I CAN'T SURVIVE 
UNDER THE HOUSE.

28
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:13,153
PERHAPS AN ATTIC 
SHALL I SEEK.

29
00:01:13,153 --> 00:01:15,795
- REAL SHODDY NARRATING. 
JUST PURE CRAP.

30
00:01:15,795 --> 00:01:18,678
- BUT WE'RE BACK ON TRACK, 
AND WE ARE SCANDAL-FREE.

31
00:01:18,678 --> 00:01:22,722
- HEY! YOU START 
THE MEETING WITHOUT ME?

32
00:01:22,722 --> 00:01:24,684
- MOTHER, UH, 
THIS IS CAL CULLEN.

33
00:01:24,684 --> 00:01:26,206
YOU REMEMBER MY MOTHER, LUCILLE.

34
00:01:26,206 --> 00:01:28,448
WE'RE RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE 
OF TALKING

35
00:01:28,448 --> 00:01:31,731
ABOUT THIS EXCITING GIVEAWAY 
SPA PACKAGE TO ENTICE BUYERS.

36
00:01:31,731 --> 00:01:33,092
- YOU KNOW, HE'S NEVER TAKEN 
ME ANYWHERE.

37
00:01:33,092 --> 00:01:34,534
OH, NO.

38
00:01:34,534 --> 00:01:36,736
WE HAVE TO LIVE 
HIGH AND DRY.

39
00:01:36,736 --> 00:01:39,139
- WELL, YOU'RE 
CERTAINLY NOT DRY.

40
00:01:39,139 --> 00:01:42,222
MICHAEL, I'M NOT A PRUDE, 
BUT IT'S 1:00 IN THE AFTERNOON.

41
00:01:42,222 --> 00:01:43,903
IS YOUR MOTHER DRUNK?

42
00:01:43,903 --> 00:01:45,665
- I'D HAVE TO GET UP PRETTY EARY 
TO GET DRUNK BY 1:00.

43
00:01:45,665 --> 00:01:47,147
[laughs]

44
00:01:47,147 --> 00:01:49,229
- AS IT TURNS OUT, 
SHE HAD GOTTEN UP EARLY

45
00:01:49,229 --> 00:01:51,111
AND HAD TAKEN PAIN MEDICATION

46
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:53,393
BECAUSE OF A HANGOVER-RELATED 
HEADACHE.

47
00:01:53,393 --> 00:01:56,956
HOWEVER, SHE MISTOOK THE 
"DROWSY EYE" ALCOHOL WARNING

48
00:01:56,956 --> 00:02:00,200
FOR A "WINKING EYE" 
ALCOHOL SUGGESTION.

49
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:03,002
FORTUNATELY, SHE HAD 
THE GOOD SENSE

50
00:02:03,002 --> 00:02:04,964
NOT TO DRIVE HERSELF 
TO THE MEETING.

51
00:02:04,964 --> 00:02:07,167
- NO. 
I'LL CALL FOR A CAR.

52
00:02:07,167 --> 00:02:11,611
- UNFORTUNATELY, THIS WAS AFTER 
A FAILED ATTEMPT TO DO SO.

53
00:02:11,611 --> 00:02:14,134
- WHO THE HELL PUT--

54
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:17,177
- MICHAEL, I'M SORRY. 
I CANNOT DO BUSINESS WITH YOU.

55
00:02:17,177 --> 00:02:20,620
I MEAN, I COULDN'T AFFORD 
TO END UP ON "SCANDALMAKERS."

56
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:22,382
- OH, YOU COULD AFFORD 
TO DO ANYTHING YOU WANT.

57
00:02:22,382 --> 00:02:23,903
YOU'RE JUST A BIG CHICKEN.

58
00:02:23,903 --> 00:02:25,385
A-COODLE-DOODLE-DOO.

59
00:02:25,385 --> 00:02:26,706
A-COODLE-DOODLE-DOO.

60
00:02:26,706 --> 00:02:27,787
A-COODLE-DOODLE-DOO.

61
00:02:27,787 --> 00:02:29,068
A-COO--

62
00:02:29,068 --> 00:02:30,590
thump!

63
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:32,352
- MICHAEL REALIZED THAT 
IT MIGHT BE TIME

64
00:02:32,352 --> 00:02:35,155
TO DEAL WITH HIS MOTHER'S 
APPARENT PROBLEM.

65
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:37,397
- OKAY, THAT SEEMS AS GOOD A 
PLACE AS ANY TO END THE MEETING.

66
00:02:41,401 --> 00:02:43,803
- NO, I'M NOT DOING ANOTHER 
INTERVENTION WITH HER.

67
00:02:43,803 --> 00:02:46,005
LAST TIME, I FELT 
TERRIBLE FOR A WEEK.

68
00:02:46,005 --> 00:02:49,489
- ONE YEAR EARLIER, THE FAMILY 
HAD TRIED AN INTERVENTION.

69
00:02:49,489 --> 00:02:51,211
- YOU'RE POURING A DRINK? 
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

70
00:02:51,211 --> 00:02:53,413
- WHAT IF SHE'S MAD? 
- GOOD POINT.

71
00:02:53,413 --> 00:02:55,295
- PERHAPS I'LL HAVE 
A LITTLE SIP OF SOMETHING.

72
00:02:55,295 --> 00:02:57,697
- GUYS, WHAT COULD SHE 
DO TO US?

73
00:02:59,018 --> 00:03:01,180
DO WE HAVE ANYTHING 
SINGLE MALT?

74
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:04,103
- AND ALTHOUGH THE INTERVENTION 
DIDN'T WORK--

75
00:03:04,103 --> 00:03:07,507
- WE THINK YOU HAVE A PROLLEN. 
- YOU'RE A MESH.

76
00:03:07,507 --> 00:03:10,590
- IT TURNED INTO ONE OF THE 
BLUTH FAMILY'S BETTER PARTIES.

77
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:13,593
[whimpering and piano plunking]

78
00:03:14,714 --> 00:03:16,436
[laughter]

79
00:03:18,838 --> 00:03:20,960
- WELL, MAYBE AN INTERVENTION 
IS THE WRONG APPROACH.

80
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,242
WHAT ABOUT REHAB?

81
00:03:22,242 --> 00:03:23,323
SHE WAS JUST A MESS 
AT THE MEETING.

82
00:03:23,323 --> 00:03:24,644
WHERE WERE YOU, BY THE WAY?

83
00:03:24,644 --> 00:03:26,646
I COULD'VE USED 
YOUR HELP WITH MOM.

84
00:03:26,646 --> 00:03:28,448
- I BELIEVE I TOLD YOU I WAS 
GONNA BE OUT FOR THE HOLIDAYS.

85
00:03:28,448 --> 00:03:29,969
IT'S SPRING BREAK.

86
00:03:29,969 --> 00:03:31,691
NOT THAT I CAN ENJOY IT.

87
00:03:31,691 --> 00:03:34,213
MY REPUTATION'S BEEN RUINED BY 
THAT JERK PHILLIP LITT,

88
00:03:34,213 --> 00:03:37,377
WHO PUT MY ONE MAGIC-SHOW FLUB 
ON HIS DVD.

89
00:03:37,377 --> 00:03:40,220
- GOB HAD PERFORMED A MAGIC ACT 
AT AN EARLIER SPRING BREAK

90
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:43,623
TO GET EXPOSURE ON THE 
BEST-SELLING VIDEO SERIES,

91
00:03:43,623 --> 00:03:45,825
"GIRLS WITH LOW SELF-ESTEEM."

92
00:03:48,388 --> 00:03:50,149
- OR TWO FLUBS OR WHATEVER.

93
00:03:50,149 --> 00:03:51,911
- THERE WERE SEVEN FLUBS,

94
00:03:51,911 --> 00:03:54,514
AND AFTER THE SHOW, 
HE SIGNED A RELEASE.

95
00:03:54,514 --> 00:03:56,396
- YOU'RE NOT GONNA USE THE TIME 
THAT I SCREWED UP, RIGHT?

96
00:03:56,396 --> 00:03:58,558
- THAT WASN'T PART OF THE ACT?

97
00:03:58,558 --> 00:03:59,919
COME ON, MAN, I'D NEVER DO 
ANYTHING TO EMBARRASS YOU.

98
00:03:59,919 --> 00:04:01,080
[squawking]

99
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,362
PLEASE.

100
00:04:02,362 --> 00:04:04,524
crunch!

101
00:04:04,524 --> 00:04:08,408
- OH. UH, YOU DON'T KNOW 
A GOOD BIRD HOSPITAL, DO YOU?

102
00:04:08,408 --> 00:04:10,450
- YOU'RE GETTING 
ALL THIS, RIGHT?

103
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:11,851
- WELL, AT LEAST 
THE ORANGE COUNTY REGISTER

104
00:04:11,851 --> 00:04:13,733
DIDN'T SAY OF YOUR PERFORMANCE,

105
00:04:13,733 --> 00:04:18,298
"IF THIS IS WHO GEORGE SR. IS, 
LET'S HOPE HE REMAINS MISSING."

106
00:04:18,298 --> 00:04:21,341
MEANWHILE, THEY LOVED 
DAVE ATTELL'S RISKY CHOICE

107
00:04:21,341 --> 00:04:23,463
OF WEARING CUTOFFS 
WHILE PORTRAYING ME.

108
00:04:23,463 --> 00:04:25,465
- IN FACT, MR. ATTELL 
WAS PORTRAYING

109
00:04:25,465 --> 00:04:28,388
TOBIAS'S ACTUAL 
NEVER-NUDE AFFLICTION,

110
00:04:28,388 --> 00:04:31,190
BUT THIS PERPLEXED 
THE "SCANDALMAKERS" AUDIENCE,

111
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:35,034
DUE TO THE UNFOCUSED NATURE 
OF THE NARRATOR'S EXPLANATION.

112
00:04:35,034 --> 00:04:36,956
- NO, I THINK MINE'S WORSE.

113
00:04:36,956 --> 00:04:38,758
YOU SHOULD'VE SEEN WHAT HAPPENED 
TO ME ON THE BOARDWALK TODAY.

114
00:04:38,758 --> 00:04:41,561
THEY WERE LAUGHING AT ME. 
ME!

115
00:04:41,561 --> 00:04:43,843
[chuckling]

116
00:04:43,843 --> 00:04:45,285
- THOSE TAPES ARE AWFUL:

117
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:47,447
WOMEN TRICKED INTO 
TAKING THEIR TOPS OFF.

118
00:04:47,447 --> 00:04:49,849
I HAVE A DAUGHTER I DON'T 
WANT CORRUPTED BY THE MEDIA.

119
00:04:49,849 --> 00:04:51,531
- UNBEKNOWNST TO LINDSAY,

120
00:04:51,531 --> 00:04:54,133
MAEBY WAS A FAIRLY PROMINENT 
MEMBER OF THE MEDIA,

121
00:04:54,133 --> 00:04:56,416
AS SHE HAD 
SECRETLY CONNED HER WAY

122
00:04:56,416 --> 00:04:58,578
INTO A JOB 
AS A FILM EXECUTIVE.

123
00:04:58,578 --> 00:05:00,540
- THIS YOUNG MAN ON THE BEACH 
SCRIPT SUCKS.

124
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:02,822
SHE'D GO TO THE GUY JUST 
'CAUSE HE SAID SHE'S AWESOME?

125
00:05:02,822 --> 00:05:05,825
YOU CALL THAT DIALOGUE? 
- HEY, I DIDN'T WRITE IT.

126
00:05:05,825 --> 00:05:07,547
- NO, BUT YOU'RE GONNA FIX IT. 
IT'S A SPRING BREAK MOVIE.

127
00:05:07,547 --> 00:05:09,389
GET DOWN THERE AND FIND OUT 
WHAT THEY SOUND LIKE.

128
00:05:09,389 --> 00:05:10,790
- OH, YEAH, RIGHT.

129
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:12,432
DO YOU REALLY THINK 
I LOOK COLLEGE-AGED?

130
00:05:12,432 --> 00:05:14,193
- I'M NOT DRUNK. 
BUT I'M WILLING TO BE.

131
00:05:14,193 --> 00:05:16,115
HINT.

132
00:05:16,115 --> 00:05:19,559
- OH, MORT, YOU'RE GONNA BE 
SO EASY TO BLACKMAIL. HINT.

133
00:05:23,122 --> 00:05:24,724
- THIS PIG, PHILLIP LITT,

134
00:05:24,724 --> 00:05:26,606
IS OUT THERE ASKING GIRLS 
TO TAKE THEIR TOPS OFF.

135
00:05:26,606 --> 00:05:28,368
IT'S AN OUTRAGE.

136
00:05:28,368 --> 00:05:29,809
- WELL, OF COURSE 
YOU FEEL THAT WAY.

137
00:05:29,809 --> 00:05:31,531
YOU'RE JEALOUS.

138
00:05:31,531 --> 00:05:34,814
YOU'RE A SURFBOARD. 
BUT I DO AGREE HE IS A PIG.

139
00:05:34,814 --> 00:05:36,576
HEY! WHAT THE HELL 
WAS THAT FOR?

140
00:05:36,576 --> 00:05:38,978
- CAN WE STOP WORRYING ABOUT 
GIRLS WITH LOW SELF-ESTEEM

141
00:05:38,978 --> 00:05:41,621
AND START FOCUSING ON SOBERING 
UP THE WOMAN WHO GAVE US OURS?

142
00:05:41,621 --> 00:05:43,983
SERIOUSLY, 
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT REHAB?

143
00:05:43,983 --> 00:05:45,985
- SHE WON'T GO WILLINGLY. 
I CAN TELL YOU THAT.

144
00:05:45,985 --> 00:05:50,590
- MAY I MAKE A SUGGESTION? 
GET IMPLANTS. REALLY.

145
00:05:50,590 --> 00:05:52,351
WHA--COME ON! 
THIS STUFF IS EXPENSIVE!

146
00:05:52,351 --> 00:05:54,273
- AND SO MICHAEL SET OUT 
TO CONVINCE HIS MOTHER

147
00:05:54,273 --> 00:05:55,555
THAT SHE NEEDED HELP.

148
00:05:55,555 --> 00:05:56,756
- HELLO? HELLO?

149
00:05:56,756 --> 00:05:58,678
I HAVE A SURPRISE FOR YOU.

150
00:05:58,678 --> 00:06:00,640
- DID I WIN THE PRIZE? 
- YOU WON THE PRIZE.

151
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:05,164
- I WON THE PRIZE! 
I WON THE PRIZE--FOR WHAT?

152
00:06:05,164 --> 00:06:07,286
- WE WERE GONNA GIVE 
ONE EMPLOYEE A WEEK AT THE SPA.

153
00:06:07,286 --> 00:06:08,808
WE WERE EVEN GONNA 
PUT THEM IN THE AD,

154
00:06:08,808 --> 00:06:10,249
BUT THEN I THOUGHT, 
"WHAT ABOUT MOM?

155
00:06:10,249 --> 00:06:11,891
SHE'S ELEGANT. 
SHE DESERVES IT."

156
00:06:11,891 --> 00:06:14,053
I WAS GONNA TELL YOU AT 
THE OFFICE, BUT THEN I THOUGHT,

157
00:06:14,053 --> 00:06:16,015
"NO. IF I BRING HER AROUND NOW,

158
00:06:16,015 --> 00:06:17,937
SHE MIGHT VOMIT 
ON THE OVERHEAD PROJECTOR."

159
00:06:17,937 --> 00:06:19,779
LET'S JUST WAIT TILL SHE'S 
CRAWLING AROUND ON HER OWN.

160
00:06:19,779 --> 00:06:21,621
- I'M SO EMBARRASSED ABOUT THAT.

161
00:06:21,621 --> 00:06:24,063
I DON'T THINK I WAS SUPPOSED 
TO DRINK WITH MY MEDICATION.

162
00:06:24,063 --> 00:06:26,506
- ACTUALLY, IT WASN'T EVEN 
HER MEDICATION.

163
00:06:26,506 --> 00:06:28,908
- OF COURSE, I CAN'T TAKE OSCAR 
TO AN ELEGANT PLACE.

164
00:06:28,908 --> 00:06:32,872
HIS ONLY REMAINING PAIR OF PANTS 
BLEW APART THE OTHER DAY.

165
00:06:32,872 --> 00:06:35,595
I WAS THINKING THAT I WOULD 
GO WITH YOU FOR THE WEEK.

166
00:06:35,595 --> 00:06:37,517
- SO WHAT? 
I JUST STAY HERE ALONE?

167
00:06:37,517 --> 00:06:40,079
I'M NOT EXACTLY EQUIPPED 
TO RUN THIS PLACE BY MYSELF!

168
00:06:40,079 --> 00:06:44,123
YOU CAN'T JUST 
LEAVE ME HERE ALONE!

169
00:06:44,123 --> 00:06:45,885
HAVE A GREAT TRIP.

170
00:06:45,885 --> 00:06:48,768
- BUT IT WOULDN'T TURN OUT 
TO BE A GREAT TRIP AT ALL.

171
00:06:48,768 --> 00:06:49,889
HELLO. WELCOME 
TO SHADY PINES REHAB.

172
00:06:49,889 --> 00:06:51,571
JUST SIGN RIGHT HERE.

173
00:06:51,571 --> 00:06:54,293
- REHAB? THIS ISN'T A SPA. 
THIS ISN'T A SPA!

174
00:06:54,293 --> 00:06:55,575
- COME HERE. WAIT. GET HER. 
COME HERE, MOM!

175
00:06:55,575 --> 00:06:57,256
- WE GOT A RUNNER!

176
00:06:57,256 --> 00:06:59,499
- AS MICHAEL'S MOTHER WAS BEING 
HELD AGAINST HER WILL,

177
00:06:59,499 --> 00:07:01,861
GEORGE SR. WAS ABOUT 
TO BE CONFRONTED

178
00:07:01,861 --> 00:07:03,503
WITH A SIMILAR PROBLEM.

179
00:07:03,503 --> 00:07:05,465
- KITTY. 
HOW'D YOU FIND ME?

180
00:07:05,465 --> 00:07:09,068
- I THOUGHT YOU WERE DEAD 
UNTIL I SAW "SCANDALMAKERS!"

181
00:07:09,068 --> 00:07:11,270
- THEY GOT SO MUCH WRONG.

182
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:13,753
BUT SOMETHING ABOUT YOUR 
SON-IN-LAW'S COMMENT,

183
00:07:13,753 --> 00:07:17,797
"PERHAPS AN ATTIC SHALL I SEEK" 
HAD THE RING OF TRUTH TO IT.

184
00:07:17,797 --> 00:07:20,560
- NOTICE IT WASN'T SOMETHING 
THE NARRATOR SAID.

185
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:23,803
- YOU ABANDONED ME IN MEXICO!

186
00:07:23,803 --> 00:07:25,525
- KITTY, HONEY, 
I--I KNOW YOU'RE MAD.

187
00:07:25,525 --> 00:07:28,087
- STOP TALKING, GEORGE. 
YOU STOP TALKING!

188
00:07:28,087 --> 00:07:31,571
I AM IN CHARGE NOW. 
YOU'RE COMING WITH ME.

189
00:07:31,571 --> 00:07:34,774
- NO, I CAN'T. I CA-- 
I HAVE A LIFE HERE.

190
00:07:34,774 --> 00:07:37,977
THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO-- 
WHO DEPEND ON ME.

191
00:07:37,977 --> 00:07:39,979
- FINE. BUT I CAN'T MAKE 
ANY PROMISES

192
00:07:39,979 --> 00:07:43,463
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS TO THAT 
COOLER OF EVIDENCE I HAVE.

193
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:46,746
- IF I COULD JUST HAVE 
A MOMENT TO SAY GOOD-BYE.

194
00:07:48,748 --> 00:07:50,510
- MEANWHILE, 
AT THE BANANA STAND,

195
00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:53,392
MAEBY WAS HOPING TO FIND 
SOME WITTY BANTER

196
00:07:53,392 --> 00:07:56,235
WITH WHICH TO AUTHENTICATE 
HER FEATURE FILM.

197
00:07:56,235 --> 00:07:57,957
- I WANT THE HOT CHICK 
TO SERVE ME.

198
00:07:57,957 --> 00:07:59,719
- WHAT OTHER WORDS WOULD YOU 
USE TO DESCRIBE ME?

199
00:07:59,719 --> 00:08:01,761
- UM, SHE'S 15, 
AND SHE'S MY COUSIN.

200
00:08:01,761 --> 00:08:03,322
- SO?

201
00:08:03,322 --> 00:08:07,487
- SO YOU CAN'T TOUCH 
YOUR COUSIN--MY COUSIN.

202
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:08,768
YOU KNOW, YOU DON'T 
HAVE TO STICK AROUND.

203
00:08:08,768 --> 00:08:10,530
I COULD JUST WORK LATE TONIGHT.

204
00:08:10,530 --> 00:08:11,731
IT DOESN'T MATTER, 'CAUSE, 
YOU KNOW, MY GIRLFRIEND,

205
00:08:11,731 --> 00:08:13,212
ANN, SHE'S OUT OF TOWN.

206
00:08:13,212 --> 00:08:14,934
WHICH ACTUALLY KIND OF 
LUCKY IN THE END,

207
00:08:14,934 --> 00:08:17,697
'CAUSE ALL THESE GUYS 
WOULD BE COMING ON TO HER.

208
00:08:17,697 --> 00:08:21,060
- YEAH, YOU REALLY DODGED 
A BULLET THERE.

209
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:24,504
- NEARBY, PHILLIP LITT 
WAS MAKING HIS LATEST VIDEO.

210
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:25,585
- EVERYBODY GATHER AROUND! 
GATHER AROUND!

211
00:08:25,585 --> 00:08:26,946
LADIES, HERE'S THE DEAL.

212
00:08:26,946 --> 00:08:29,869
WE HAVE HATS. 
YOU HAVE BREASTS.

213
00:08:29,869 --> 00:08:32,311
YOU SHOW YOUR BREASTS, 
YOU GET A HAT, OKAY?

214
00:08:32,311 --> 00:08:34,073
SO IF ANYONE WANTS 
TO GET BACK AT DADDY,

215
00:08:34,073 --> 00:08:35,835
NOW'S THE TIME.

216
00:08:35,835 --> 00:08:38,638
WHOO! WAIT. CUT, CUT.

217
00:08:38,638 --> 00:08:41,120
WE GOT A SURFBOARD IN THE SHOT. 
- SURFBOARD. STOP TAPE.

218
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,042
- WE'RE HERE TO STOP YOU FROM 
TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THESE GIRLS.

219
00:08:43,042 --> 00:08:45,204
[booing]

220
00:08:45,204 --> 00:08:46,966
- YOU KNOW WHAT? 
YOU'RE SASSY. YOU'RE SEXY.

221
00:08:46,966 --> 00:08:48,968
YOU SPEAK YOUR MIND. 
THERE'S NOTHIN' HOTTER.

222
00:08:48,968 --> 00:08:51,250
- GIVE HER A HAT, BARRY. 
- I DON'T WANT A HAT.

223
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:52,732
I WANT YOU TO LEAVE 
THESE WOMEN ALONE.

224
00:08:52,732 --> 00:08:54,453
- I'M GIVING THEM A CHANCE 
TO BE IDOLIZED,

225
00:08:54,453 --> 00:08:55,895
WHICH IS AN OPPORTUNITY

226
00:08:55,895 --> 00:08:57,256
THESE WOMEN ARE NEVER 
GONNA HAVE AGAIN.

227
00:08:57,256 --> 00:08:58,337
- I WANT TO BE IDOLIZED. 
- YEAH, YOU DO!

228
00:08:58,337 --> 00:08:59,659
[cheering]

229
00:08:59,659 --> 00:09:01,060
- EILEEN, STOP IT.

230
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:02,782
YOU'VE GOT NOTHING 
TO GAIN FROM THAT.

231
00:09:02,782 --> 00:09:05,625
- THAT'S EASY FOR YOU TO SAY. 
YOU ALREADY HAVE A HAT.

232
00:09:05,625 --> 00:09:08,387
- COME ON, GIRLS!

233
00:09:08,387 --> 00:09:11,190
- THIS IS NO WAY TO GET 
YOUR DADDIES TO NOTICE YOU!

234
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:14,153
- NEARBY, LINDSAY'S OWN DADDY 
FAILED TO NOTICE HER

235
00:09:14,153 --> 00:09:17,797
AS HE WAS BEING TAKEN 
TO A LOCAL MOTEL

236
00:09:17,797 --> 00:09:20,439
WHERE HE REFUSED 
KITTY'S SEXUAL ADVANCES.

237
00:09:20,439 --> 00:09:23,603
- YOU PROMISED ME POWER 
AND A CHILD,

238
00:09:23,603 --> 00:09:26,045
AND I HAVE NEITHER.

239
00:09:26,045 --> 00:09:29,849
I'M GONNA TAKE CARE 
OF THIS PROBLEM ON MY OWN.

240
00:09:33,412 --> 00:09:36,576
- YOU NEVER PROMISE 
CRAZY A BABY.

241
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:40,099
- GEORGE SR. WAS ABANDONED 
AND LONGED FOR LUCILLE,

242
00:09:40,099 --> 00:09:43,062
AND BUSTER FELT THE SAME WAY.

243
00:09:44,784 --> 00:09:49,388
- UPON HER KNEE,

244
00:09:49,388 --> 00:09:53,152
SO FINE TO BE...

245
00:09:53,152 --> 00:09:54,874
- WHO-HOO-HOO!

246
00:09:54,874 --> 00:09:58,477
- MOTHER AND BOY...

247
00:09:58,477 --> 00:10:00,239
- RESTLESS, BUSTER WENT 
TO THE KITCHEN

248
00:10:00,239 --> 00:10:02,481
TO FIND SOMETHING 
TO HELP HIM SLEEP

249
00:10:02,481 --> 00:10:04,644
WHEN HE CAME ACROSS LUCILLE'S 
EMERGENCY STASH OF WINE...

250
00:10:04,644 --> 00:10:06,365
- MOTHERLODE

251
00:10:06,365 --> 00:10:08,928
- WHICH HE MISTOOK 
FOR A GIANT JUICE BOX.

252
00:10:08,928 --> 00:10:12,091
- MAMA'S MOVIN' ON... 
- MAMA'S ALL ALONE...

253
00:10:12,091 --> 00:10:15,334
- IT WAS THE FIRST TASTE 
OF ALCOHOL BUSTER HAD

254
00:10:15,334 --> 00:10:17,296
SINCE HE WAS NURSING.

255
00:10:17,296 --> 00:10:19,338
- MAMA'S GOT THE STUFF-- 
- MAMA!

256
00:10:19,338 --> 00:10:21,380
- AND MICHAEL, HIS MOTHER 
NO LONGER A THREAT...

257
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:22,541
- THANK YOU SO MUCH 
FOR YOUR UNDERSTANDING, SIR.

258
00:10:22,541 --> 00:10:24,343
- MET AGAIN WITH CAL CULLEN.

259
00:10:24,343 --> 00:10:30,630
- AS I MENTIONED ON THE PHONE, 
SHE DID SEEK HELP.

260
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,311
AND IT WAS EXTREMELY MOVING

261
00:10:32,311 --> 00:10:34,433
WHEN SHE FINALLY ADMITTED 
THAT SHE HAS A PROBLEM.

262
00:10:34,433 --> 00:10:36,716
- WE'LL TAKE GOOD CARE OF YOU 
HERE AT SHADY PINES.

263
00:10:36,716 --> 00:10:38,718
- I'LL TAKE CARE OF YOU, 
YOU SON OF A--

264
00:10:38,718 --> 00:10:42,041
- SHADY PINES IS A WONDERFUL 
FACILITY UP THERE ON THE HILL.

265
00:10:42,041 --> 00:10:43,643
YOU KNOW, THEY USED TO FILM 
"SUGARFOOT" UP THERE.

266
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:46,405
- NO!

267
00:10:46,405 --> 00:10:48,127
- WERE YOU A FAN 
OF "SUGARFOOT?"

268
00:10:48,127 --> 00:10:49,448
- I LOVED IT.

269
00:10:49,448 --> 00:10:51,210
- "SUGARFOOT" HAD BEEN 
OFF THE AIR

270
00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:53,773
12 YEARS BEFORE 
MICHAEL WAS BORN.

271
00:10:53,773 --> 00:10:56,936
- WELL, SING THE THEME SONG 
OF SUGARFOOT ALONG WITH ME.

272
00:10:56,936 --> 00:10:58,898
- SUGARFOOT, YEAH, 
SUGARFOOT...

273
00:10:58,898 --> 00:11:00,539
- SUGARFOOT, YES...

274
00:11:00,539 --> 00:11:02,141
- EASY LOPIN', CATTLE-ROPIN' 
SUGARFOOT...

275
00:11:02,141 --> 00:11:03,823
- NA, NA, NA...

276
00:11:03,823 --> 00:11:06,906
- CAREFREE AS THE TUMBLEWEEDS-- 
- HUCHAH!

277
00:11:06,906 --> 00:11:08,988
- OH, WHAT THE HELL. 
YOU'RE A GOOD KID.

278
00:11:08,988 --> 00:11:10,870
LET'S MAKE THE DEAL.

279
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:12,111
- OH, GREAT. 
I'VE GOT PAPERS--

280
00:11:12,111 --> 00:11:13,352
- MICHAEL!

281
00:11:13,352 --> 00:11:15,074
REMEMBER ME?

282
00:11:15,074 --> 00:11:16,315
PERHAPS THIS'LL JOG YOUR MEMORY.

283
00:11:16,315 --> 00:11:18,157
- OH, THEY'RE CROOKED.

284
00:11:18,157 --> 00:11:19,759
- I'VE KIDNAPPED YOUR FATHER, 
MICHAEL,

285
00:11:19,759 --> 00:11:21,841
AND I HAVE A COOLER 
FULL OF EVIDENCE

286
00:11:21,841 --> 00:11:24,443
THAT WILL BRING DOWN 
THIS CORRUPT COMPANY

287
00:11:24,443 --> 00:11:26,165
UNLESS YOUR MOTHER 
MEETS ME TODAY

288
00:11:26,165 --> 00:11:29,729
AT 4:00 AT SENOR TADPOLE'S.

289
00:11:29,729 --> 00:11:32,331
SPRING BREAK. 
WHOO!

290
00:11:37,216 --> 00:11:38,818
- DAD?

291
00:11:38,818 --> 00:11:41,420
- MICHAEL'S FATHER 
HAD JUST BEEN KIDNAPPED...

292
00:11:43,863 --> 00:11:45,544
- [cell phone rings] 
- HELLO?

293
00:11:45,544 --> 00:11:46,986
- AND THEN HE RECEIVED A CALL

294
00:11:46,986 --> 00:11:48,828
THAT HIS BROTHER 
HAD BEEN FOUND DRUNK.

295
00:11:48,828 --> 00:11:50,069
- NO, I'M FINE. 
I'M TELLING YOU.

296
00:11:50,069 --> 00:11:51,791
FOR THE FIRST TIME,

297
00:11:51,791 --> 00:11:54,513
I REALIZE THAT MAYBE 
I AM BETTER OFF WITHOUT HER.

298
00:11:54,513 --> 00:11:56,115
- YEAH, WELL, WE'VE GOTTA 
BRING HER BACK.

299
00:11:56,115 --> 00:11:57,837
- OH, THANK GOD!

300
00:11:57,837 --> 00:12:00,039
- SO IF WE WANT TO GET 
THAT EVIDENCE BACK, AND DAD,

301
00:12:00,039 --> 00:12:02,321
KITTY IS INSISTING 
ON A MEETING WITH MOM.

302
00:12:02,321 --> 00:12:03,843
- WHAT CAN MOM DO FOR HER? 
- I DON'T KNOW.

303
00:12:03,843 --> 00:12:05,204
I'VE GOTTA GET 
MY HANDS ON THAT EVIDENCE.

304
00:12:05,204 --> 00:12:06,846
PROBLEM IS I JUST 
CHECKED HER INTO REHAB.

305
00:12:06,846 --> 00:12:08,247
THEY'RE NOT EXACTLY GONNA 
LET ME CHECK HER OUT

306
00:12:08,247 --> 00:12:10,089
AND TAKE HER TO A BAR.

307
00:12:10,089 --> 00:12:12,531
SO, GOB, I NEED YOU TO HELP ME 
SNEAK HER PAST THE GUARDS.

308
00:12:12,531 --> 00:12:14,213
- WELL, GEE, I DIDN'T THINK 
THE WOMAN I'D BE CHECKING OUT

309
00:12:14,213 --> 00:12:15,895
AT SPRING BREAK WOULD BE MOM.

310
00:12:15,895 --> 00:12:17,456
- SHE'S BETTER LOOKING 
THAN THE WHORES YOU DATE.

311
00:12:17,456 --> 00:12:19,218
- DON'T CALL MY ESCORTS WHORES.

312
00:12:19,218 --> 00:12:21,260
- MOM'S STILL GOT IT! 
- I DON'T DATE WHORES!

313
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:22,902
- STOP IT! 
STOP IT!

314
00:12:22,902 --> 00:12:25,384
THIS OBJECTIFICATION OF WOMEN 
HAS TO STOP!

315
00:12:25,384 --> 00:12:26,786
- IT'S JUST MOM AND WHORES.

316
00:12:26,786 --> 00:12:28,267
- NO, HOW WOULD YOU LIKE IT?

317
00:12:28,267 --> 00:12:29,308
ACTUALLY, 
THAT'S NOT A BAD IDEA.

318
00:12:29,308 --> 00:12:30,749
I SHOULD TURN THE TABLES ON MEN

319
00:12:30,749 --> 00:12:32,551
AND SEE HOW THEY LIKE 
BEING OBJECTIFIED.

320
00:12:32,551 --> 00:12:34,593
- MEN WITH LOW SELF-ESTEEM. 
GET THEIR CLOTHES OFF.

321
00:12:34,593 --> 00:12:38,037
- THAT IS A GREAT-- 
[grunts]

322
00:12:38,037 --> 00:12:40,759
THAT IS A GREAT 
SOCIAL STATEMENT.

323
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:44,563
I SHALL GET THE VIDEO CAMERA. 
THIS IS RIPE FOR PARODY.

324
00:12:44,563 --> 00:12:47,807
THIS IS RIPE!

325
00:12:47,807 --> 00:12:50,489
- HE JUST WANTS TO SEE 
BOYS' LINUSES.

326
00:12:50,489 --> 00:12:54,613
- OH, GOD.

327
00:12:54,613 --> 00:12:56,295
HERE WE GO.

328
00:12:56,295 --> 00:13:00,940
- AND SO MICHAEL WENT BACK 
TO SEE HIS MOM.

329
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:02,581
- I--I KNOW THAT YOU'RE 
UPSET WITH ME

330
00:13:02,581 --> 00:13:04,583
BECAUSE I BROUGHT YOU HERE 
UNDER FALSE PRETENSES,

331
00:13:04,583 --> 00:13:05,985
BUT I REALLY WAS WORRIED 
ABOUT YOU.

332
00:13:05,985 --> 00:13:07,947
- OH, PLEASE.

333
00:13:07,947 --> 00:13:09,308
I'VE BEEN DRINKING 
SINCE BEFORE YOU WERE BORN.

334
00:13:09,308 --> 00:13:10,910
SO IF ALCOHOL 
IS THE REASON I'M HERE,

335
00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:12,992
I'VE GOT NEWS FOR YOU, BUB.

336
00:13:12,992 --> 00:13:14,954
IT'S THE ONLY REASON 
YOU'RE HERE TOO.

337
00:13:14,954 --> 00:13:17,356
- HEY, YOU'RE MEAN SOBER TOO.

338
00:13:17,356 --> 00:13:19,598
UH, LISTEN. 
I NEED YOUR HELP.

339
00:13:19,598 --> 00:13:22,401
KITTY HAS SHOWN UP, 
AND SHE GOT AHOLD OF DAD.

340
00:13:22,401 --> 00:13:24,283
- SHE FOUND HIM IN THE ATTIC?

341
00:13:24,283 --> 00:13:27,086
THEY HAD A RERUN 
OF "SCANDALMAKERS" LAST NIGHT.

342
00:13:27,086 --> 00:13:29,048
EVERYBODY FIGURED IT OUT.

343
00:13:29,048 --> 00:13:30,729
- SHE WOULD LIKE 
TO MEET YOU AT A BAR.

344
00:13:30,729 --> 00:13:32,611
SHE SAYS SHE'S GOT SOME EVIDENCE

345
00:13:32,611 --> 00:13:35,174
THAT COULD BRING THE BUSINESS 
DOWN IF YOU DON'T GO.

346
00:13:35,174 --> 00:13:37,136
- YOU'RE SENDING ME 
INTO A BAR?

347
00:13:37,136 --> 00:13:40,419
ARE YOU SURE YOU CAN TRUST ME 
TO MAKE DECISIONS FOR MYSELF?

348
00:13:40,419 --> 00:13:42,101
- I JUST NEED YOU TO FIND 
OUT WHAT SHE WANTS, OKAY,

349
00:13:42,101 --> 00:13:45,384
WHILE I CHECK 
ALL THE LOCAL MOTELS FOR DAD.

350
00:13:45,384 --> 00:13:46,665
- ALL RIGHT. 
BUT HERE'S WHAT I WANT.

351
00:13:46,665 --> 00:13:48,988
A SPA WEEKEND WITH YOU. 
A REAL ONE.

352
00:13:48,988 --> 00:13:52,111
I WANT TO SPEND 
SPRING BREAK WITH YOU.

353
00:13:53,392 --> 00:13:55,074
- YOU HAVE HIGH SELF-ESTEEM, 
RIGHT?

354
00:13:55,074 --> 00:13:57,957
- NOT AFTER BEING IN HERE. 
IT'S A NIGHTMARE.

355
00:13:57,957 --> 00:13:59,758
- MICHAEL, MOM!

356
00:13:59,758 --> 00:14:01,881
WE'VE GOTTA GO NOW. 
I CREATED A DIVERSION.

357
00:14:01,881 --> 00:14:03,522
YOU'RE GONNA LOVE THIS.

358
00:14:03,522 --> 00:14:05,444
I'D LIKE TO CHECK MY UNCLE 
IN FOR REHAB.

359
00:14:05,444 --> 00:14:07,486
- I THOUGHT WE WERE BUYING ME 
SOME PANTS.

360
00:14:07,486 --> 00:14:10,449
- OH, OF COURSE YOU THINK THAT. 
YOU'RE HIGH AS A KITE!

361
00:14:10,449 --> 00:14:13,132
HE NEEDS HELP! 
ANY-- HE NEEDS HELP!

362
00:14:13,132 --> 00:14:17,536
HE NEEDS HELP!

363
00:14:17,536 --> 00:14:21,700
- AND SO LUCILLE WAS ABLE TO MET 
WITH KITTY AT SENOR TADPOLE'S.

364
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:24,783
- I WANT WHAT'S DUE TO ME-- 
A BLUTH SON.

365
00:14:24,783 --> 00:14:26,505
AND I KNOW 
YOU HAVE THE MATERIAL.

366
00:14:26,505 --> 00:14:29,028
- KITTY WAS RIGHT. 
TEN YEARS EARLIER,

367
00:14:29,028 --> 00:14:32,831
GEORGE SR. WAS TAKING AN 
EXPERIMENTAL HAIR GROWTH DRUG.

368
00:14:32,831 --> 00:14:34,633
FEARING DAMAGE 
TO HIS FERTILITY,

369
00:14:34,633 --> 00:14:37,436
HE FROZE A SPECIMEN 
OF HIS REPRODUCTIVE MATERIAL

370
00:14:37,436 --> 00:14:40,639
IN CASE HE EVER WANTED 
ANOTHER CHILD.

371
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:43,482
SOON, NEWS CAME OUT 
THAT THE DRUG,

372
00:14:43,482 --> 00:14:45,044
ALTHOUGH SOMEWHAT SUCCESSFUL,

373
00:14:45,044 --> 00:14:48,407
WREAKED HAVOC 
ON THE CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM.

374
00:14:52,411 --> 00:14:53,852
- SO WHAT DO YOU NEED ME FOR?

375
00:14:53,852 --> 00:14:56,095
HE'S NOT TAKING 
THE MONKEY DRUG ANYMORE.

376
00:14:56,095 --> 00:14:57,816
AND YOU'RE THE ONE 
WHO'S GOT HIM, NOT ME.

377
00:14:57,816 --> 00:14:58,817
- OH, YOU KNOW WHY.

378
00:14:58,817 --> 00:15:00,299
- HE WON'T TOUCH ME.

379
00:15:00,299 --> 00:15:02,341
HE SAID HE DOESN'T CHEAT 
ON HIS WIFE ANYMORE.

380
00:15:02,341 --> 00:15:06,946
- HE SAID THAT? 
- DRINKING CONTEST!

381
00:15:06,946 --> 00:15:09,348
- TELL YOU WHAT. 
I'LL DRINK YOU FOR IT.

382
00:15:09,348 --> 00:15:12,631
- OH, I HEARD YOU DON'T HANDLE 
YOUR BOOZE SO WELL ANYMORE.

383
00:15:12,631 --> 00:15:14,553
- SO THIS SHOULD BE 
EASY FOR YOU.

384
00:15:17,516 --> 00:15:20,719
THAT ONE DIDN'T COUNT.

385
00:15:20,719 --> 00:15:24,083
- AND MICHAEL MET UP WITH GOB 
TO TRY AND FIND THEIR FATHER.

386
00:15:24,083 --> 00:15:25,965
- I GOT IT. 
FROM THE BANANA STAND FREEZER.

387
00:15:25,965 --> 00:15:29,128
THE EXACT SAME KIND OF COOLER 
THAT'S IN THE PHOTO WITH DAD.

388
00:15:29,128 --> 00:15:30,689
- WHAT DO WE NEED 
ANOTHER COOLER FOR?

389
00:15:30,689 --> 00:15:32,171
- AH, POOR MICHAEL.

390
00:15:32,171 --> 00:15:34,413
YOU DO NOT THINK 
LIKE A MAGICIAN.

391
00:15:34,413 --> 00:15:36,135
SUCH A "HOW'D HE DO DAT?" 
- UH-HUH.

392
00:15:36,135 --> 00:15:37,536
- IT'S A CLASSIC 
BAIT AND SWITCH.

393
00:15:37,536 --> 00:15:39,178
- THIS IS A DECOY COOLER.

394
00:15:39,178 --> 00:15:40,819
WE TAKE IT IN, SWITCH IT 
WITH THE ONE FROM THE PHOTO

395
00:15:40,819 --> 00:15:42,301
AND GET OUT OF THERE.

396
00:15:42,301 --> 00:15:43,742
KITTY COMES BACK. 
EVERYTHING'S NORMAL.

397
00:15:43,742 --> 00:15:45,464
IT'S LIKE WE WERE NEVER THERE.

398
00:15:45,464 --> 00:15:47,586
- BUT DAD'S GONE. 
- LONG GONE.

399
00:15:47,586 --> 00:15:49,468
BUT IT BUYS US ALL THE TIME 
IN THE WORLD.

400
00:15:49,468 --> 00:15:50,629
I GOT IT BACK, MIKEY. 
THE SELF-CONFIDENCE.

401
00:15:50,629 --> 00:15:52,551
I AM A MAGICIAN!

402
00:15:52,551 --> 00:15:54,673
- I'M SAYING, WHEN KITTY COMES 
BACK, NOTICES DAD'S GONE,

403
00:15:54,673 --> 00:15:56,195
FIRST THING SHE'S GONNA DO 
IS CHECK THE COOLER,

404
00:15:56,195 --> 00:15:57,636
SEE IF THE EVIDENCE 
IS STILL THERE.

405
00:15:57,636 --> 00:16:00,039
BUYS US, LIKE, ONE SECOND.

406
00:16:00,039 --> 00:16:01,680
- I AM A WORTHLESS MAGICIAN. 
- NOT TRUE.

407
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:03,002
- NO, I CAN'T EVEN DO 
ONE SIMPLE TRICK.

408
00:16:03,002 --> 00:16:04,483
I'M COVERED IN SWEAT! 
LOOK AT ME!

409
00:16:04,483 --> 00:16:06,125
- DON'T SAY THAT. 
IT'S A GREAT TRICK.

410
00:16:06,125 --> 00:16:08,527
WOULD'VE BEEN FLAWLESS 
IF YOU HAD A DECOY DAD TOO.

411
00:16:08,527 --> 00:16:09,888
- DAMN IT.

412
00:16:09,888 --> 00:16:11,010
AND I USED A GUY 
THAT LOOKED JUST LIKE HIM

413
00:16:11,010 --> 00:16:14,613
IN MY LAST BAIT AND SWITCH.

414
00:16:14,613 --> 00:16:17,616
- OW! OW! OW! OW!

415
00:16:17,616 --> 00:16:18,897
- WELL, I'M NO LONGER 
NEEDED HERE.

416
00:16:18,897 --> 00:16:20,379
- NO, NO, NO.

417
00:16:20,379 --> 00:16:21,900
I THINK THE COOLER'S 
ACTUALLY GONNA HELP US.

418
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:24,423
THE EXTRA SECOND THAT IT BUYS US 
COULD BE THE DIFFERENCE.

419
00:16:24,423 --> 00:16:26,865
- GREAT, JUST GIVE ME A COUPLE 
OF MINUTES TO CATCH MY BREATH.

420
00:16:26,865 --> 00:16:30,629
[sighs]

421
00:16:34,673 --> 00:16:37,196
- LUCILLE, MINUTES OUT OF REHAB,

422
00:16:37,196 --> 00:16:39,318
WAS ENGAGING 
IN A DRINKING CONTEST

423
00:16:39,318 --> 00:16:41,200
AT THE BEHEST OF HER SON.

424
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:43,002
[crowd cheering]

425
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:44,123
- LET ME KNOW WHEN YOU'RE READY, 
DEAR.

426
00:16:44,123 --> 00:16:45,804
- KEEP MIXING!

427
00:16:45,804 --> 00:16:47,366
- WHILE RIGHT OUTSIDE THE BAR...

428
00:16:47,366 --> 00:16:49,248
- I KNOW WHAT THE SHAPE 
OF A BANANA REMINDS YOU OF,

429
00:16:49,248 --> 00:16:51,170
AND I KNOW THAT WHEN I SAY 
"NUTS," IT MAKES YOU GIGGLE.

430
00:16:51,170 --> 00:16:52,491
- [giggling]

431
00:16:52,491 --> 00:16:54,253
- BUT DO YOU HAVE 
ANY OTHER RESPONSE

432
00:16:54,253 --> 00:16:56,935
TO "HERE'S A BANANA 
WITH NUTS"?

433
00:16:56,935 --> 00:17:00,739
- [hysterical laughter]

434
00:17:00,739 --> 00:17:03,422
- WHY ARE WE EVEN GOING AFTER 
THIS IDIOT DEMOGRAPHIC?

435
00:17:03,422 --> 00:17:04,983
- MAEBY, DON'T YOU GET IT? 
THEY'RE NOT EVEN EATING THESE.

436
00:17:04,983 --> 00:17:06,865
THEY JUST LIKE SAYING 
BANANAS AND NUTS.

437
00:17:06,865 --> 00:17:08,387
AND I WON'T-- 
I WON'T TELL YOU WHY.

438
00:17:08,387 --> 00:17:09,948
THAT'S YOUR FATHER'S JOB.

439
00:17:09,948 --> 00:17:12,631
- COME ON! 
LET'S SEE SOME BANANAS AND NUTS!

440
00:17:12,631 --> 00:17:15,194
OH, PERHAPS WE SHOULD 
JUST PULL THEIR PANTS OFF.

441
00:17:15,194 --> 00:17:16,635
- HEY, WHAT THE HELL 
DO YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING?

442
00:17:16,635 --> 00:17:18,237
THIS IS WHERE WE SHOOT.

443
00:17:18,237 --> 00:17:19,718
- YEAH, WELL, 
YOU'VE GOT COMPETITION NOW,

444
00:17:19,718 --> 00:17:21,200
'CAUSE WE'RE MAKING OUR OWN 
VIDEO.

445
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,961
- WILL YOU JUST GET OVER IT? 
IT'S NUDITY.

446
00:17:22,961 --> 00:17:24,363
JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE ASHAMED 
OF YOUR BODY

447
00:17:24,363 --> 00:17:25,484
DOESN'T MEAN EVERYBODY 
SHOULD BE.

448
00:17:25,484 --> 00:17:27,486
- OH, REALLY?

449
00:17:27,486 --> 00:17:32,251
WELL, LET'S SEE HOW YOU FEEL 
ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE PACKING.

450
00:17:32,251 --> 00:17:34,012
- YOU'RE A [bleep] NEVER-NUDE?

451
00:17:34,012 --> 00:17:35,374
- YOU'RE ASKING GIRLS 
TO TAKE THEIR TOPS OFF,

452
00:17:35,374 --> 00:17:37,056
AND YOU CAN'T EVEN BE NAKED?

453
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:38,817
I'VE GOTTA GET THIS.

454
00:17:38,817 --> 00:17:42,901
- LINDSAY, I'VE ALREADY GOT IT.

455
00:17:42,901 --> 00:17:47,386
I'M BACK INTO CUTOFFS. 
LINDSAY?

456
00:17:47,386 --> 00:17:48,787
- I DIDN'T SEE YOU 
AT THE CONVENTION.

457
00:17:48,787 --> 00:17:49,948
- NO, I WAS IN GERMANY. 
I TELECONFERENCED IN.

458
00:17:49,948 --> 00:17:51,430
- OHHH.

459
00:17:51,430 --> 00:17:52,631
- DID YOU GO TO THE SEMINAR 
ON CHAFING?

460
00:17:52,631 --> 00:17:53,872
- DR. SCHOENWEISS? 
YES.

461
00:17:53,872 --> 00:17:55,194
- THIS IS NEVER GONNA WORK.

462
00:17:55,194 --> 00:17:56,835
THERE'S TOO MANY PEOPLE, 
TOO MANY ROOMS.

463
00:17:56,835 --> 00:17:58,637
- MICHAEL, WE CAN'T GIVE UP. 
THIS IS IMPORTANT.

464
00:17:58,637 --> 00:18:00,599
BELIEVE ME, I'D RATHER 
BE DOWN AT THE BEACH,

465
00:18:00,599 --> 00:18:02,921
HAVING DRINKS, 
HOWLING AT CHICKS.

466
00:18:02,921 --> 00:18:04,683
[howls]

467
00:18:04,683 --> 00:18:06,405
- [nearby howling] 
- DAD?

468
00:18:06,405 --> 00:18:08,607
- [howls]

469
00:18:08,607 --> 00:18:11,170
OH, MY BOYS. 
YES, YOU--YOU CAME FOR ME.

470
00:18:11,170 --> 00:18:12,811
- YEAH, HI, DAD.

471
00:18:12,811 --> 00:18:14,413
UH, GOB'S GONNA GET YOU OUT 
OF THOSE HANDCUFFS.

472
00:18:14,413 --> 00:18:17,055
CAN YOU DO IT, PAL? 
- ONE HANDCUFF KEY COMING UP.

473
00:18:17,055 --> 00:18:18,457
- GREAT.

474
00:18:18,457 --> 00:18:20,459
- [retching]

475
00:18:22,141 --> 00:18:23,982
- WHAT THE HELL 
ARE YOU DOING?

476
00:18:23,982 --> 00:18:25,944
- SWALLOWED A KEY JUST IN CASE 
I ENDED UP DOING A SHOW.

477
00:18:25,944 --> 00:18:28,667
- [retching] 
- COME ON. THIS IS DISGUSTING.

478
00:18:28,667 --> 00:18:29,788
- I'M DOING THIS FOR YOU.

479
00:18:29,788 --> 00:18:31,750
- THIS CONTINUED FOR SOME TIME,

480
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:33,432
WHILE MICHAEL SWITCHED OUT 
THE COOLERS.

481
00:18:33,432 --> 00:18:34,673
- WHY ARE YOU SWITCHING OUT 
THE COOLERS?

482
00:18:34,673 --> 00:18:36,355
- IT BUYS US TIME, DAD.

483
00:18:36,355 --> 00:18:38,117
- WHAT? LIKE A SECOND? 
- DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT, OKAY?

484
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:39,318
I WILL TELL YOU THIS.

485
00:18:39,318 --> 00:18:40,679
WHEN I GET THIS EVIDENCE 
OUT OF HERE,

486
00:18:40,679 --> 00:18:41,680
I'M TURNING IT 
RIGHT INTO THE COURT.

487
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:43,122
- ARE YOU KIDDING?

488
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:44,123
I DON'T CARE IF THE EVIDENCE 
GETS OUT THERE.

489
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:45,484
IT GETS ME OFF THE HOOK.

490
00:18:45,484 --> 00:18:46,885
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING? 
THIS EXONERATES YOU?

491
00:18:46,885 --> 00:18:48,447
- I TOLD YOU BEFORE. 
I WAS A PATSY.

492
00:18:48,447 --> 00:18:51,490
I WAS SET UP. 
I AM TIRED OF LOOKING GUILTY.

493
00:18:51,490 --> 00:18:54,173
- WELL, THAT'S--THAT'S GREAT.

494
00:18:54,173 --> 00:18:57,015
- [gags]

495
00:18:57,015 --> 00:18:58,096
[clattering]

496
00:18:58,096 --> 00:19:00,179
NOW WHO'S A HORRIBLE MAGICIAN?

497
00:19:00,179 --> 00:19:03,302
- THAT IS A CROWN, 
YOU HORSE'S ASS.

498
00:19:03,302 --> 00:19:06,945
- HOW DOES THAT MAKE YOU FEEL? 
- AWESOME.

499
00:19:06,945 --> 00:19:08,587
- AND GEORGE MICHAEL CAUGHT UP 
WITH MAEBY,

500
00:19:08,587 --> 00:19:10,829
DETERMINED TO SAVE 
HER SELF-ESTEEM.

501
00:19:10,829 --> 00:19:12,271
- LOOK, I DON'T WANT 
TO RUIN YOUR FUN, YOU KNOW,

502
00:19:12,271 --> 00:19:14,593
BUT I HATE TO SEE GUYS 
TREAT YOU LIKE THIS.

503
00:19:14,593 --> 00:19:16,074
YOU'RE BETTER THAN THAT. 
TO ME ANYWAY.

504
00:19:16,074 --> 00:19:17,836
YOU'RE-- 
- AWESOME?

505
00:19:17,836 --> 00:19:19,678
NO, I WAS GONNA SAY 
YOU'RE--

506
00:19:19,678 --> 00:19:22,321
YOU'RE LIKE THIS FLOWER, 
AND I KNOW IT'S SPRINGTIME,

507
00:19:22,321 --> 00:19:24,963
BUT I JUST--I'D HATE 
TO SEE YOU GET PLUCKED

508
00:19:24,963 --> 00:19:27,486
BY SOMEONE WHO DOESN'T EVEN CARE 
THAT YOU'RE BLOSSOMING.

509
00:19:27,486 --> 00:19:30,209
- THAT'S WHAT I'VE 
BEEN WAITING TO HEAR.

510
00:19:30,209 --> 00:19:34,813
- MAEBY WAS REFERRING 
TO THE DIALOGUE,

511
00:19:34,813 --> 00:19:37,135
BUT GEORGE MICHAEL 
HAD JUST REDISCOVERED

512
00:19:37,135 --> 00:19:39,057
HIS FEELINGS FOR HIS COUSIN.

513
00:19:39,057 --> 00:19:41,019
- HI, ANN, IT'S-- 
IT'S GEORGE MICHAEL BLUTH.

514
00:19:41,019 --> 00:19:44,663
UM, WHEN YOU GET BACK 
INTO TOWN, WE SHOULD TALK.

515
00:19:44,663 --> 00:19:48,267
[thump] 
[crowd applauding]

516
00:19:48,267 --> 00:19:50,189
- CAN I GET YOU 
ANYTHING ELSE, MA'AM?

517
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:52,511
- NO, THANKS. 
I HAVE TO GET BACK TO REHAB.

518
00:19:52,511 --> 00:19:53,912
- SHE'S IN REHAB!

519
00:19:53,912 --> 00:19:57,035
[cheering]

520
00:19:57,035 --> 00:20:00,038
- AND SO GEORGE SR. WAS FREE,

521
00:20:00,038 --> 00:20:02,681
AND MICHAEL AND GOB 
ABSCONDED WITH THE EVIDENCE.

522
00:20:02,681 --> 00:20:05,204
- ONE HECK OF A TRICK YOU ENDED 
UP PULLIN' IN THERE, GOB.

523
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:07,085
- TRUTHFULLY, THAT WASN'T 
PART OF THE ACT.

524
00:20:07,085 --> 00:20:09,488
I WAS ACTUALLY TRYING TO GET 
THE KEY TO COME OUT OF MY MOUTH.

525
00:20:09,488 --> 00:20:11,370
- THAT PART WAS VERY SURPRISING,

526
00:20:11,370 --> 00:20:14,493
BUT I'M TALKING ABOUT HOW YOU 
HELPED ME GET DAD OUT OF THERE.

527
00:20:14,493 --> 00:20:17,576
THANKS TO YOU, THIS FAMILY 
COULD END UP BEING OKAY.

528
00:20:17,576 --> 00:20:21,740
- AND GOB HAD FINALLY OVERCOME 
HIS OWN LOW SELF-ESTEEM.

529
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:25,744
- HEY, AREN'T YOU THAT MAGICIAN 
WHO ALWAYS EMBARRASSES HIMSELF?

530
00:20:25,744 --> 00:20:28,947
- NOT ANYMORE. 
NOT ANYMORE.

531
00:20:28,947 --> 00:20:33,872
- GOB! 
- BUT HE LOST IT,

532
00:20:33,872 --> 00:20:37,075
ALONG WITH 
THE EXONERATING EVIDENCE.

533
00:20:37,075 --> 00:20:40,559
- THEY'RE LAUGHING, MICHAEL. 
THEY'RE LAUGHING.

534
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:44,363
- AND THAT'S HOW 
YOU NARRATE A STORY.

535
00:20:44,363 --> 00:20:47,125
ON THE NEXT 
"ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT".

536
00:20:47,125 --> 00:20:49,248
LUCILLE GETS SOME 
DISTURBING INFORMATION.

537
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:50,529
DID YOU GET THE EVIDENCE?

538
00:20:50,529 --> 00:20:53,091
- YES, AND THEN GOB RUINED IT.

539
00:20:53,091 --> 00:20:55,774
AFTER ALL THE TROUBLE WE WENT 
THROUGH TO SWITCH COOLERS

540
00:20:55,774 --> 00:20:56,895
WITH THE ONE 
FROM THE BANANA STAND.

541
00:20:56,895 --> 00:20:58,337
- THE ONE IN THE FREEZER?

542
00:20:58,337 --> 00:21:00,939
I WAS STORING VERY IMPORTANT 
THINGS THERE.

543
00:21:00,939 --> 00:21:05,824
- AND KITTY FINDS 
WHAT SHE'S BEEN LOOKING FOR.

544
00:21:10,789 --> 00:21:16,114
- THERE WAS 250 C.C.s OF YOUR 
FATHER IN THAT BANANA STAND!

545
00:21:16,114 --> 00:21:18,597
- NO TOUCHING.

546
00:21:22,321 --> 00:21:24,202
- [singing]

547
00:21:24,202 --> 00:21:26,525
SOMEHOW I'M ALWAYS 
FINDIN' MYSELF

548
00:21:26,525 --> 00:21:29,728
I'M STUCK 
STUCK IN THE SAME PLACE

549
00:21:29,728 --> 00:21:33,972
SAME RULES WITH THE SAME FOOLS 
ALWAYS BE PICKIN' ON ME

550
00:21:33,972 --> 00:21:39,778
I'M GONNA BE STICKIN' AROUND

551
00:21:39,778 --> 00:21:45,023
I'M STICKIN' AROUND

552
00:21:45,023 --> 00:21:48,427
THIS TIME

553
00:21:49,067 --> 00:22:01,119
UH
