narrator: NOW THE STORY OF A 
WEALTHY FAMILY

2
00:00:02,918 --> 00:00:04,004
WHO LOST EVERYTHING...

3
00:00:04,004 --> 00:00:05,338
AND THE ONE SON 
WHO HAD NO CHOICE...

4
00:00:05,338 --> 00:00:07,965
BUT TO KEEP THEM ALL TOGETHER.

5
00:00:13,554 --> 00:00:15,806
IT'S ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT.

6
00:00:18,643 --> 00:00:19,894
MICHAEL BLUTH BEGAN HIS DAY

7
00:00:19,894 --> 00:00:21,687
WITH SOMETHING HE'D NEVER SEEN 
BEFORE.

8
00:00:21,687 --> 00:00:24,023
TV announcer: I'M HEARING GOOD 
THINGS ABOUT THE BLUTH COMPANY.

9
00:00:24,023 --> 00:00:26,651
narrator: GOOD NEWS ABOUT HIS 
FAMILY'S HOUSING BUSINESS.

10
00:00:26,651 --> 00:00:27,902
TV announcer: 
OLD MAN BLUTH'S IN JAIL.

11
00:00:27,902 --> 00:00:28,944
I THINK HIS SON IS 
RUNNING THE COMPANY.

12
00:00:28,944 --> 00:00:31,364
DOESN'T SEEM LIKE 
A TOTAL MORON TO ME.

13
00:00:31,364 --> 00:00:32,782
I'VE HAD THIS THING AS A 
TRIPLE SELL,

14
00:00:32,782 --> 00:00:35,660
AND I AM UPGRADING 
IT RIGHT HERE, RIGHT NOW.

15
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:37,828
I THINK THIS THING COULD EVEN 
GO AS HIGH AS A "DON'T BUY."

16
00:00:37,828 --> 00:00:39,330
[bell rings]

17
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:42,667
- DON'T BUY! HUH? 
MOM, DID YOU SEE THAT?

18
00:00:42,667 --> 00:00:44,460
TV announcer: 
DON'T BUY BLUTH!

19
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:48,214
- YOU BUILD A HOUSE THAT'S GOOD, 
PEOPLE ARE GONNA WANNA COME--

20
00:00:51,509 --> 00:00:53,678
THIS SINKHOLE SPREAD 
A LITTLE BIT MORE LAST NIGHT?

21
00:00:53,678 --> 00:00:55,055
ANYWAY, I'M GONNA GO TO THE 
PRISON.

22
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:57,682
I'M GONNA TELL DAD 
ABOUT THIS NEWS.

23
00:00:57,682 --> 00:00:59,350
- I THOUGHT YOU SAID 
WE SHOULDN'T VISIT HIM.

24
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:00,893
- VISIT, NO. 
GLOAT, YES.

25
00:01:00,893 --> 00:01:02,145
I'VE WORKED VERY, VERY HARD 
FOR THIS.

26
00:01:02,145 --> 00:01:04,021
I SOLD THE CABIN 
PROPERTY TO KEEP US AFLOAT.

27
00:01:04,021 --> 00:01:06,691
I HAVEN'T HAD ANY TIME 
TO SPEND WITH MY SON.

28
00:01:06,691 --> 00:01:09,026
- WELL, NOW YOU CAN SPEND TIME 
WITH MY SON.

29
00:01:09,026 --> 00:01:11,487
I WANT YOUR BROTHER 
BUSTER TO COME LIVE WITH YOU.

30
00:01:11,487 --> 00:01:15,283
AND IT'S NOT BECAUSE HE HAS THAT 
HORRIBLE HOOK FOR A HAND NOW.

31
00:01:15,283 --> 00:01:17,660
IT'S THE SNORING. 
LISTEN TO THIS.

32
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:19,870
BUSTER'S SNORING. 
WEDNESDAY NIGHT.

33
00:01:19,870 --> 00:01:21,122
[Buster snoring]

34
00:01:21,122 --> 00:01:23,040
IT'S DRIVING ME CRA--

35
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,168
YOU WON'T EVEN KNOW 
HE'S HERE.

36
00:01:25,168 --> 00:01:26,836
- YOU SEEM MORE VILLAINOUS 
THAN USUAL, MOM.

37
00:01:26,836 --> 00:01:27,920
ARE YOU SOBER?

38
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:31,466
- MICHAEL, IT'S 8:00 A.M. 
- SO, IT'S NOT THAT.

39
00:01:31,466 --> 00:01:33,593
- I DON'T KNOW.

40
00:01:33,593 --> 00:01:36,011
MAYBE IT'S BECAUSE I WENT OFF 
MY POSTPARTUM MEDICATION.

41
00:01:36,011 --> 00:01:38,889
- YOU WERE STILL TAKING THAT? 
YOU HAD BUSTER 32 YEARS AGO.

42
00:01:38,889 --> 00:01:41,267
- AND THAT'S HOW LONG 
I'VE BEEN DEPRESSED ABOUT HIM.

43
00:01:41,267 --> 00:01:44,187
ACTUALLY, I DID GO OFF IT IN 
THE EARLY '90S,

44
00:01:44,187 --> 00:01:47,607
BUT I DIDN'T 
LIKE WHAT HAPPENED TO ME.

45
00:01:47,607 --> 00:01:48,983
TV announcer: CLAIMING SHE COULD 
TAKE IT NO MORE,

46
00:01:48,983 --> 00:01:51,277
THE YOUNG MOTHER 
RELEASED THE EMERGENCY BRAKE,

47
00:01:51,277 --> 00:01:53,988
ALLOWING HER CAR TO ROLL 
BACKWARDS INTO THE NEARBY LAKE.

48
00:01:53,988 --> 00:01:55,615
- GOOD FOR HER.

49
00:01:57,617 --> 00:01:59,410
I MUST HAVE GAINED 
THREE POUNDS.

50
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:01,121
- WHY DID YOU GO OFF THEM 
THIS TIME?

51
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:03,789
- WELL, APPARENTLY, 
MOOD-ALTERING MEDICATION

52
00:02:03,789 --> 00:02:05,250
LEADS TO STREET DRUGS.

53
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:07,835
THAT'S WHAT THIS VERY HANDSOME 
YOUNG DOCTOR SAID

54
00:02:07,835 --> 00:02:09,170
ON THE TODAY SHOW.

55
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:12,173
- THAT WAS TOM CRUISE, 
THE ACTOR.

56
00:02:12,173 --> 00:02:15,301
- THEY SAID HE WAS 
SOME KIND OF SCIENTIST.

57
00:02:15,301 --> 00:02:17,553
- MAYBE YOU SHOULD GET AWAY 
FROM BUSTER.

58
00:02:17,553 --> 00:02:19,889
WHY DON'T YOU GO UP 
TO THE CABIN IN THE WOODS.

59
00:02:19,889 --> 00:02:21,432
- I THOUGHT YOU SAID WE SOLD IT.

60
00:02:21,432 --> 00:02:22,683
- WE SOLD THE PROPERTY.

61
00:02:22,683 --> 00:02:24,310
I WORKED IT OUT SO WE COULD 
RELOCATE THE CABIN,

62
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:25,561
BUT IT IS GONNA BE UP IN 
TAHOE

63
00:02:25,561 --> 00:02:27,147
FOR ANOTHER COUPLE 
OF DAYS.

64
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:29,982
MAYBE YOU CAN 
TAKE A DATE UP THERE.

65
00:02:29,982 --> 00:02:31,984
- HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO FIND 
SOMEONE

66
00:02:31,984 --> 00:02:34,487
WILLING TO GO INTO THAT MUSTY 
OLD CLAPTRAP?

67
00:02:38,491 --> 00:02:39,992
- THE CABIN. 
YES.

68
00:02:39,992 --> 00:02:43,663
THAT WOULD BE DIFFICULT TOO.

69
00:02:43,663 --> 00:02:45,665
PLEASE GET BACK ON THE MEDS, 
MOM.

70
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:49,294
WE MISS THE OLD, OLD YOU.

71
00:02:49,294 --> 00:02:51,671
- I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW 
THAT WE HAD A CABIN.

72
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:54,674
- AH--[bleeps]. 
WELL, FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH, GOB,

73
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:57,176
I'VE NEVER ACTUALLY BEEN THERE.

74
00:02:57,176 --> 00:02:58,636
narrator: ALTHOUGH HE'D OFTEN 
BEEN PROMISED.

75
00:02:58,636 --> 00:03:00,388
- HEY, PAL. SOMETHING'S COME UP.

76
00:03:00,388 --> 00:03:01,931
THIS NICE YOUNG LADY HAS LOST 
HER PUPPY

77
00:03:01,931 --> 00:03:04,267
AND YOUR DAD'S 
GOT TO HELP HER FIND HIM.

78
00:03:04,267 --> 00:03:07,812
- OH, BAD NEWS, BUDDY. 
THIS YOUNG LADY'S DAD IS SICK,

79
00:03:07,812 --> 00:03:10,356
AND I'M TAKING HER 
TO THE HOSPITAL.

80
00:03:10,356 --> 00:03:12,149
COME ON. YOU'RE OLD ENOUGH 
TO FIGURE THIS OUT.

81
00:03:12,149 --> 00:03:13,526
I'M NAILING THIS BROAD.

82
00:03:13,526 --> 00:03:16,571
- PARDON ME IF I DON'T 
BURST INTO TEARS, MICHAEL,

83
00:03:16,571 --> 00:03:19,532
BUT AT LEAST HE 
PROMISED TO TAKE YOU.

84
00:03:19,532 --> 00:03:22,535
HE JUST LET ME BLINDLY 
ENJOY MY CHILDHOOD.

85
00:03:22,535 --> 00:03:25,538
I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW THERE WAS A 
CABIN HE WASN'T TAKING ME TO.

86
00:03:25,538 --> 00:03:27,915
- MMM. 
MINE'S SADDER.

87
00:03:27,915 --> 00:03:30,167
- I DON'T SEE 
YOU CRYING, ROBOT!

88
00:03:30,167 --> 00:03:32,420
YOU TASTE THESE TEARS. 
TASTE MY SAD, MICHAEL.

89
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:35,506
- NO. NOT GONNA 
LICK YOUR EYE, OKAY.

90
00:03:35,506 --> 00:03:36,924
- WELL, I WILL TELL 
YOU THIS, MICHAEL.

91
00:03:36,924 --> 00:03:38,384
I DON'T HAVE A SON.

92
00:03:38,384 --> 00:03:39,635
narrator: HE DOES.

93
00:03:39,635 --> 00:03:40,636
BUT IF I EVER DO,

94
00:03:40,636 --> 00:03:42,430
I'M EITHER GONNA TAKE HIM 
TO THE CABIN IN THE WOODS,

95
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:44,515
OR I'M GONNA PROMISE TO TAKE HIM 
AND THEN NOT TAKE HIM.

96
00:03:44,515 --> 00:03:47,560
BUT THE ONE THING 
THAT I WILL NEVER DO...

97
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,812
IS NOT TELL HIM THAT I'M TAKING 
HIM TO A CABIN IN THE WOODS,

98
00:03:49,812 --> 00:03:52,315
AND THEN NOT TAKE HIM.

99
00:03:52,315 --> 00:03:54,275
narrator: 
GOB WAS GROWING UP.

100
00:03:54,275 --> 00:03:55,526
- WELL, THE CABIN IN THE WOODS

101
00:03:55,526 --> 00:03:57,570
IS GONNA BE STACKED UP 
NEXT TO OUR CARPORT.

102
00:03:57,570 --> 00:04:00,990
BUT MAYBE WE SHOULD HEAD UP 
THERE TONIGHT, HUH?

103
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:04,577
ONE...FIRST TIME.

104
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:05,828
- TASTE THE HAPPY, MICHAEL.

105
00:04:05,828 --> 00:04:07,372
- OH, NO. 
[grunts]

106
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:08,623
- TASTE IT.

107
00:04:08,623 --> 00:04:09,749
- TASTES KIND OF LIKE SAD.

108
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:11,000
narrator: MICHAEL SET OFF 
TO PRISON

109
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,128
TO TELL OFF HIS FATHER 
WHEN HE DISCOVERED HIS SON.

110
00:04:14,128 --> 00:04:15,255
- GEORGE MICHAEL?

111
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:16,297
- DAD, HEY.

112
00:04:16,297 --> 00:04:17,423
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

113
00:04:17,423 --> 00:04:18,508
- I DIDN'T WANNA MISS 
YOU BECAUSE

114
00:04:18,508 --> 00:04:19,967
YOU'VE BEEN LEAVING SO EARLY 
LATELY.

115
00:04:19,967 --> 00:04:21,844
- YOU SLEPT OUT HERE 
TO SEE ME?

116
00:04:21,844 --> 00:04:23,554
narrator: MICHAEL HAD NEVER BEEN 
SO TOUCHED

117
00:04:23,554 --> 00:04:25,598
BY SOMETHING HIS SON HAD SAID.

118
00:04:25,598 --> 00:04:26,849
BUT IT WASN'T TRUE.

119
00:04:26,849 --> 00:04:30,603
HE WAS HIDING FROM HIS COUSIN 
AFTER AN AWKWARD INCIDENT.

120
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:33,606
[loud rumbling]

121
00:04:33,606 --> 00:04:36,066
THEY'D SINCE BEEN TRYING 
TO AVOID EACH OTHER,

122
00:04:36,066 --> 00:04:38,944
WHICH WAS DIFFICULT, CONSIDERING 
THEY SHARED A BUNK BED.

123
00:04:41,447 --> 00:04:42,573
- OH, HI.

124
00:04:42,573 --> 00:04:45,451
- HI.

125
00:04:45,451 --> 00:04:46,702
I'M OFF TO THE CAR.

126
00:04:46,702 --> 00:04:47,828
- I'LL BE IN 
THE CRAWL SPACE.

127
00:04:47,828 --> 00:04:49,455
- TELL YOU WHAT, HOW WOULD YOU 
LIKE TO HEAD UP TO THE CABIN?

128
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:51,123
- CAN YOU AFFORD TO SKIP WORK?

129
00:04:51,123 --> 00:04:52,917
- I THINK THE PRESIDENT 
OF A "DON'T BUY" COMPANY

130
00:04:52,917 --> 00:04:54,752
CAN AFFORD TO TAKE A DAY OFF.

131
00:04:54,752 --> 00:04:57,297
- WE'RE UP FROM "SELL"?

132
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:58,548
IT'S HAPPENING, ISN'T IT?

133
00:04:58,548 --> 00:04:59,590
- IT'S REALLY HAPPENING.

134
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:01,759
IT'S TIME FOR US TO START 
CREATING SOME MEMORIES.

135
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:06,597
THERE'S BEEN ENOUGH 
DISAPPOINTMENT IN THIS FAMILY.

136
00:05:06,597 --> 00:05:08,308
[clattering]

137
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:09,559
- THERE'S ONLY ONE SLEEPING BAG,

138
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:10,851
SO WE'RE GONNA 
HAVE TO DOUBLE UP.

139
00:05:10,851 --> 00:05:11,977
PIGS IN A BLANKET!

140
00:05:11,977 --> 00:05:15,398
- SORRY, PAL. 
SOMETHING CAME UP.

141
00:05:16,857 --> 00:05:18,901
- IT IS WORSE TO KNOW.

142
00:05:18,901 --> 00:05:21,321
narrator: GOB WAS GETTING LIFE 
LESSONS ALL OVER THE PLACE.

143
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:22,863
AND MICHAEL BROKE 
A TWO-MONTH SILENCE

144
00:05:22,863 --> 00:05:24,615
AND WENT TO VISIT HIS FATHER.

145
00:05:24,615 --> 00:05:27,201
- YOU CAME! 
SOMEONE CAME!

146
00:05:27,201 --> 00:05:29,244
- ONLY TO TELL YOU THAT THE 
COMPANY IS BACK ON TRACK AND

147
00:05:29,244 --> 00:05:32,332
IT'S BECAUSE YOU'RE BEHIND BARS.

148
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:34,459
AND NOW I GET TO DO WITH MY SON 
WHAT YOU NEVER DID WITH ME.

149
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:36,168
I'M TAKING HIM TO THE CABIN.

150
00:05:36,168 --> 00:05:38,379
- SCAR! 
AND EVERY NIGHT--

151
00:05:38,379 --> 00:05:41,466
- I'M SCARRED TOO, BUT MY SON 
IS NOT GOING TO BE.

152
00:05:41,466 --> 00:05:42,717
- AND THEY COVER IT WITH SOAP,

153
00:05:42,717 --> 00:05:45,302
AND YOU'RE SUPPOSED 
TO THANK THEM.

154
00:05:45,302 --> 00:05:46,804
- SO THAT'S IT. 
THAT'S ALL I CAME TO SAY.

155
00:05:46,804 --> 00:05:48,097
- LIKE THEY'RE 
DOING YOU A FAVOR!

156
00:05:48,097 --> 00:05:50,099
- ANYTHING YOU'D LIKE FOR ME 
TO PASS ON TO THE FAMILY?

157
00:05:50,099 --> 00:05:51,642
- I'M YOUR UNCLE!

158
00:05:51,642 --> 00:05:55,730
I'M YOUR DAD'S 
TWIN BROTHER!

159
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:59,108
I'M OSCAR! 
HE SWITCHED ON ME.

160
00:05:59,108 --> 00:06:00,568
NO ONE BELIEVES ME.

161
00:06:00,568 --> 00:06:02,027
narrator: 
UNFORTUNATELY FOR OSCAR,

162
00:06:02,027 --> 00:06:04,614
"YOU'VE GOT THE WRONG TWIN" 
WAS A VERY POPULAR ALIBI.

163
00:06:04,614 --> 00:06:06,574
- YOU'VE SIMPLY GOT 
THE WRONG TWIN.

164
00:06:06,574 --> 00:06:09,118
- WE'RE QUADRUPLETS. 
YOU'VE GOT THE WRONG TWO.

165
00:06:09,118 --> 00:06:12,329
- WE'RE LARRY AND DAVE. 
- YOU WANT CURTIS AND JEFF.

166
00:06:12,329 --> 00:06:16,792
- I EVEN STARTED A WEB SITE-- 
IMOSCAR.COM.

167
00:06:16,792 --> 00:06:19,545
I'M INNOCENT, MICHAEL.

168
00:06:19,545 --> 00:06:21,422
IMOSCAR.COM!

169
00:06:24,341 --> 00:06:26,594
- NO, NO, DON'T BUY IT. 
I'M TAKING MY SON TO THE CABIN,

170
00:06:26,594 --> 00:06:27,845
AND THERE'S NOTHING YOU CAN SAY

171
00:06:27,845 --> 00:06:30,681
TO MAKE ME BELIEVE THAT 
YOU ARE NOT MY FATHER.

172
00:06:30,681 --> 00:06:33,183
- I UNDERSTAND.

173
00:06:33,183 --> 00:06:37,187
YOUR CHILD COMES FIRST.

174
00:06:37,187 --> 00:06:41,400
- OH, MY GOD, YOU'RE OSCAR. 
- DOT COM.

175
00:06:45,446 --> 00:06:47,197
narrator: SO MICHAEL 
RETURNED TO THE OFFICE

176
00:06:47,197 --> 00:06:48,991
TO TRY AND FREE HIS UNCLE.

177
00:06:48,991 --> 00:06:51,952
- DON'T BUY! DON'T BUY! 
DON'T BUY!

178
00:06:51,952 --> 00:06:53,203
narrator: 
WHEN HE REALIZED HOW MUCH

179
00:06:53,203 --> 00:06:55,330
THAT FREEDOM WOULD COST HIS 
EMPLOYEES.

180
00:06:55,330 --> 00:06:56,582
- DON'T BUY!

181
00:06:56,582 --> 00:06:58,501
WE DID IT, MIKEY. 
WE'RE SUPER RICH AGAIN.

182
00:06:58,501 --> 00:07:01,295
AND I'M GONNA BUY A CAR. 
THE VOLVO.

183
00:07:01,295 --> 00:07:03,255
- LINDSAY, YOU'RE NOT GONNA 
START SPENDING MONEY.

184
00:07:03,255 --> 00:07:05,174
AND THIS IS NOT A VOL-VO.

185
00:07:05,174 --> 00:07:06,300
- OH, THAT'S FROM SITTING 
ON THE COPIER.

186
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:07,384
- LINDSAY, NO--

187
00:07:07,384 --> 00:07:08,469
- MICHAEL, I'VE GOT NOTHING.

188
00:07:08,469 --> 00:07:11,221
MY HUSBAND DUMPED ME AND 
RAN OFF TO VEGAS WITH KITTY.

189
00:07:11,221 --> 00:07:12,473
THAT BLEACHED 
BLONDE WHORE.

190
00:07:12,473 --> 00:07:14,349
- HE'S DEFINITELY GOT A TYPE.

191
00:07:14,349 --> 00:07:16,310
- I CAN'T BELIEVE HE LEFT ME.

192
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:19,313
I MEAN, THIS AND THESE 
AND THIS!

193
00:07:19,313 --> 00:07:21,774
- THAT'S THE CAR. 
- OH.

194
00:07:21,774 --> 00:07:23,025
THIS.

195
00:07:23,025 --> 00:07:24,276
- GLAD I DIDN'T SPRING FOR 
COLOR.

196
00:07:24,276 --> 00:07:25,736
LINDSAY, THE ONLY REASON YOU 
WANT TOBIAS

197
00:07:25,736 --> 00:07:27,029
IS BECAUSE YOU CAN'T HAVE HIM.

198
00:07:27,029 --> 00:07:28,739
AND THE SECOND THAT YOU 
CAN HAVE SOMETHING,

199
00:07:28,739 --> 00:07:29,949
ALL OF A SUDDEN 
YOU DON'T WANT IT.

200
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:31,200
- THAT'S NOT WHO I AM, MICHAEL.

201
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,327
- NO? ALL RIGHT, 
MAYBE YOU'RE RIGHT.

202
00:07:33,327 --> 00:07:35,370
MAYBE WE SHOULD 
GET YOU THIS CAR.

203
00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:37,790
- I DON'T KNOW. 
IT'S SO BOXY.

204
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:42,962
- GOB. 
- OH, MICHAEL.

205
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:45,089
HOW'S DAD? 
- UH, I DON'T KNOW.

206
00:07:45,089 --> 00:07:46,340
IT'S OSCAR WHO'S IN PRISON.

207
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:49,343
IF I LET HIM OUT, PEOPLE 
WILL KNOW DAD IS FREE,

208
00:07:49,343 --> 00:07:52,346
AND THOSE PEOPLE OUT THERE 
WILL END UP PAYING FOR IT.

209
00:07:52,346 --> 00:07:56,517
DAD HASN'T, UH, TRIED 
TO CONTACT YOU, HAS HE?

210
00:07:56,517 --> 00:08:00,563
- [scoffs] LIKE I'D EVER HEAR 
FROM THAT SON OF A BITCH.

211
00:08:00,563 --> 00:08:01,814
narrator: EARLIER THAT DAY,

212
00:08:01,814 --> 00:08:03,566
GOB RECEIVED A LETTER 
FROM A GROUP...

213
00:08:03,566 --> 00:08:08,654
THAT REUNITED ABANDONED SONS 
WITH THEIR FATHERS, CALLED SAD.

214
00:08:08,654 --> 00:08:12,533
- FATHER-SON REUNION? 
BUT DAD'S STILL IN PRISON.

215
00:08:12,533 --> 00:08:14,494
narrator: BUT NOW THE LETTER 
MADE SENSE.

216
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:16,621
- THAT SON OF A BITCH.

217
00:08:16,621 --> 00:08:18,498
- LAW OFFICES 
OF BARRY ZUCKERKORN.

218
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:19,749
- HI, IT'S MICHAEL BLUTH 
FOR BARRY.

219
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:21,667
- BARRY WENT TO RENO 
TO SEE YOUR FATHER.

220
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:23,753
- RENO? HE SAID HE'S BEEN 
VISITING MY FATHER IN PRISON.

221
00:08:23,753 --> 00:08:25,170
- YEAH.

222
00:08:25,170 --> 00:08:28,883
BARRY SAYS A LOT OF THINGS 
HE DOESN'T MEAN.

223
00:08:28,883 --> 00:08:31,468
- WELL, I GUESS I'M GOING 
TO RENO TO LOOK FOR DAD.

224
00:08:31,468 --> 00:08:35,097
- GOOD LUCK, FAVORITE SON.

225
00:08:35,097 --> 00:08:38,142
narrator: SO ONCE AGAIN, MICHAEL 
WENT AFTER THE FATHER...

226
00:08:38,142 --> 00:08:40,269
WHO'D ONCE AGAIN ABANDONED HIM, 
ONLY TO FIND...

227
00:08:40,269 --> 00:08:44,064
HE WAS ABOUT TO DO 
THE SAME THING TO HIS OWN SON.

228
00:08:44,064 --> 00:08:46,150
- IT'S NOT HAPPENING, IS IT?

229
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:47,652
- SOMETHING CAME UP.

230
00:08:52,948 --> 00:08:54,534
narrator: MICHAEL HAD 
JUST TOLD HIS SON

231
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:56,619
THEY WOULDN'T 
BE GOING TO THE CABIN.

232
00:08:56,619 --> 00:08:57,870
- BUT THE CABIN'S IN LAKE TAHOE.

233
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:59,747
SO I'M SAYING THAT'S RIGHT NEAR 
RENO, AND WE COULD--

234
00:08:59,747 --> 00:09:01,290
- YEAH, BUT THIS IS GONNA 
BE LIKE AN ADULT TRIP.

235
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:02,833
AUNT LINDSAY WILL BE HERE.

236
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:04,084
HI.

237
00:09:04,084 --> 00:09:06,003
HEY, WHY DON'T YOU POP A TENT IN 
FRONT WITH YOUR COUSIN MAEBY?

238
00:09:06,003 --> 00:09:07,254
- WHAT? 
NO!

239
00:09:07,254 --> 00:09:09,381
- I'M NOT REALLY 
THE OUTDOORSY TYPE.

240
00:09:09,381 --> 00:09:10,758
- WELL, THEN THIS IS A GOOD 
CHANCE FOR

241
00:09:10,758 --> 00:09:13,052
YOU TO RUB OFF ON HER.

242
00:09:16,388 --> 00:09:18,558
narrator: AS MICHAEL SET OUT 
TO FIND HIS FATHER,

243
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:20,685
GOB THOUGHT HE WAS DOING 
THE SAME.

244
00:09:20,685 --> 00:09:24,188
- [sighs] 
- THERE'S MY GUY!

245
00:09:24,188 --> 00:09:28,483
[laughs] 
HEY, BUDDY, COME ON.

246
00:09:28,483 --> 00:09:30,945
- GETTIN' 'EM TO TRACK DOWN 
YOUR DAD TOO?

247
00:09:30,945 --> 00:09:32,487
- MY DAD ACTUALLY HAD THEM 
TRACK ME DOWN.

248
00:09:32,487 --> 00:09:34,198
- OH.

249
00:09:34,198 --> 00:09:39,203
- BUT...IT DOES LOOK LIKE 
HE'S NOT GONNA SHOW.

250
00:09:39,203 --> 00:09:42,790
KIND OF FEEL LIKE THAT KID 
WHO FOUND THE SEVERED HAND.

251
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:47,086
- [chuckles] HEY, DAD, 
LOOK WHAT I FOUND.

252
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:50,840
- ANYTHING FOR 
HIS FATHER'S APPROVAL.

253
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,967
HEARTBREAKING.

254
00:09:52,967 --> 00:09:54,301
- YOU LOOK FAMILIAR.

255
00:09:54,301 --> 00:09:57,262
- I THINK THAT'S BECAUSE 
WE ACTUALLY KIND OF LOOK ALIKE.

256
00:09:57,262 --> 00:09:59,181
narrator: REMEMBER WHEN I SAID 
GOB HAD A SON?

257
00:09:59,181 --> 00:10:00,224
- I'M GOB.

258
00:10:00,224 --> 00:10:02,351
narrator: 
I WASN'T JUST SAYING THAT.

259
00:10:02,351 --> 00:10:05,855
IN HIGH SCHOOL, GOB BECAME 
INTIMATE WITH THESE GIRLS.

260
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:09,316
THESE GIRLS GOT PREGNANT. 
THIS ONE HAD A BABY.

261
00:10:09,316 --> 00:10:10,693
AND THAT BABY WOULD 
GROW UP TO BE--

262
00:10:10,693 --> 00:10:14,238
- STEVE HOLT.

263
00:10:14,238 --> 00:10:17,366
ALL I EVER WANTED WAS TO SPEND A 
LITTLE TIME WITH MY DAD.

264
00:10:17,366 --> 00:10:20,661
MAYBE GO CAMPING. BUT I GUESS 
THAT WILL NEVER HAPPEN.

265
00:10:20,661 --> 00:10:23,706
- LOOK, I KNOW THIS IS GONNA 
SOUND KIND OF CRAZY,

266
00:10:23,706 --> 00:10:26,375
BUT MY FAMILY HAS A CABIN IN THE 
WOODS FOR ONE MORE NIGHT.

267
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:29,461
MAYBE WE COULD GO UP TO RENO, 
GET THE KEYS AND GO CAMPING.

268
00:10:29,461 --> 00:10:33,423
YOU KNOW, SORT OF... 
A SON-AND-SON THING.

269
00:10:33,423 --> 00:10:34,842
narrator: 
IF STEVE HAD HAD A FATHER,

270
00:10:34,842 --> 00:10:36,135
HE WOULD'VE WARNED HIM...

271
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:37,762
NOT TO GO INTO THE WOODS 
WITH STRANGE MEN,

272
00:10:37,762 --> 00:10:39,263
BUT HE DIDN'T.

273
00:10:39,263 --> 00:10:42,307
- SURE! LET'S GO! 
- OKAY. GREAT.

274
00:10:42,307 --> 00:10:44,268
THIS IS ME RIGHT HERE. 
- OKAY.

275
00:10:44,268 --> 00:10:46,228
YEAH, BABY! 
- STEVE HOLT!

276
00:10:46,228 --> 00:10:48,939
narrator: MICHAEL, MEANWHILE, 
ARRIVED IN RENO,

277
00:10:48,939 --> 00:10:52,151
A CITY COMPETING WITH 
LAS VEGAS' SUCCESSFUL...

278
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:55,362
"WHAT HAPPENS IN VEGAS 
STAYS IN VEGAS" CAMPAIGN,

279
00:10:55,362 --> 00:10:57,823
AND SET ABOUT SEARCHING 
FOR BARRY ZUCKERKORN.

280
00:10:57,823 --> 00:10:59,074
- I'M LOOKING FOR A MAN

281
00:10:59,074 --> 00:11:02,411
WHO'S PROBABLY IN THE SEEDY 
UNDERBELLY OF RENO.

282
00:11:02,411 --> 00:11:03,663
- OH, THE CHRISTIAN LEAGUE

283
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:05,956
HAD THE SEEDY UNDERBELLY 
SHUT DOWN.

284
00:11:05,956 --> 00:11:07,917
NOW IT'S A SWALLOWS.

285
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:10,920
narrator: SWALLOWS WAS A 
FAMILY-STYLE RESTAURANT BY DAY,

286
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:14,173
AND AN ANYTHING-GOES, 
PANSEXUAL BAZAAR BY NIGHT.

287
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:17,802
- CAN I INTEREST YOU IN A 
SMOOTHIE OR AN AMYL--MICHAEL!

288
00:11:17,802 --> 00:11:20,930
- TOBIAS, I THOUGHT THAT 
YOU WERE IN VEGAS WITH KITTY

289
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:22,056
IN THE BLUE MAN GROUP?

290
00:11:22,056 --> 00:11:24,934
- NO, AS IT TURNS OUT, 
THE PART THAT I'D...

291
00:11:24,934 --> 00:11:27,770
DESTROYED MY LIFE TO GET 
HAD ALREADY BEEN CAST.

292
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:29,521
narrator: THE ROLE WAS FILLED 
BY GEORGE SR.,

293
00:11:29,521 --> 00:11:32,817
WHO USED IT 
TO HIDE IN PLAIN SIGHT.

294
00:11:32,817 --> 00:11:34,944
THAT IS, UNTIL HE CHOKED 
ON A MARSHMALLOW...

295
00:11:34,944 --> 00:11:37,947
AND ALMOST DIED WHEN 
NO ONE NOTICED HE TURNED BLUE.

296
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:42,576
- SO, KITTY SUGGESTED WE COME UP 
HERE TO TRY OUT IN RENO, AND--

297
00:11:42,576 --> 00:11:44,829
- UH, I'LL BE HONEST, 
MICHAEL--

298
00:11:44,829 --> 00:11:49,499
LEAVING LINDSAY WAS THE BIGGEST 
LITTLE MISTAKE I'VE EVER MADE.

299
00:11:49,499 --> 00:11:52,711
I CAN'T SEEM TO CALL HER THOUGH. 
DAMN THIS PRIDE OF MINE!

300
00:11:52,711 --> 00:11:53,963
- TUNA MELT'S UP,

301
00:11:53,963 --> 00:11:55,630
AND YOU NEED TO FLIP THE 
CUSHIONS IN THE GRIND ROOM.

302
00:11:55,630 --> 00:11:56,966
- YES, SIR. RIGHT AWAY, SIR. 
OH, GREAT.

303
00:11:56,966 --> 00:12:00,052
NOW I'M GONNA BE SMELLING 
TO HIGH HEAVEN LIKE A TUNA MELT.

304
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:01,511
- TOBIAS WHAT WOULD YOU SAY 
IF I TOLD YOU

305
00:12:01,511 --> 00:12:04,139
THAT LINDSAY MIGHT BE WILLING 
TO GET BACK TOGETHER WITH YOU?

306
00:12:04,139 --> 00:12:06,600
- OH, UH, 
I'LL CALL HER RIGHT NOW.

307
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,477
- ACTUALLY, WHY DON'T YOU LET ME 
HANDLE IT? YOU KNOW LINDSAY.

308
00:12:08,477 --> 00:12:10,645
SHE ONLY 
WANTS WHAT SHE CAN'T HAVE.

309
00:12:10,645 --> 00:12:11,897
WHAT WOULD YOU DO 
ABOUT KITTY?

310
00:12:11,897 --> 00:12:14,775
- I CAN'T LIE TO YOU, MICHAEL.

311
00:12:14,775 --> 00:12:17,402
KITTY LEFT ME TWO DAYS AGO.

312
00:12:17,402 --> 00:12:19,613
THERE'S A BLUE HANDPRINT ON 
THE BACK OF YOUR HEAD, KITTY.

313
00:12:19,613 --> 00:12:20,781
ARE YOU SEEING SOMEONE ELSE?

314
00:12:20,781 --> 00:12:24,743
- FACE IT, TOBIAS. 
IT'S OVER!

315
00:12:24,743 --> 00:12:25,995
- SAY GOOD-BYE TO THESE!

316
00:12:25,995 --> 00:12:27,287
- THOSE ARE BLUE TOO!

317
00:12:27,287 --> 00:12:29,331
- THERE WERE 
BLUE HANDPRINTS ON THEM?

318
00:12:29,331 --> 00:12:32,084
- YES. AND I SWEAR TO YOU, 
THEY WEREN'T--

319
00:12:32,084 --> 00:12:34,795
- YOURS. NO, I KNOW. 
IT ALL POINTS TO DAD.

320
00:12:34,795 --> 00:12:36,046
DAD'S IN RENO, 
KITTY'S IN RENO.

321
00:12:36,046 --> 00:12:37,798
DAD'S IN KITTY, 
AND HE MUST BE A BLUE MAN.

322
00:12:37,798 --> 00:12:39,174
I'M GONNA GO CHECK OUT 
THE THEATER.

323
00:12:39,174 --> 00:12:41,886
- OKAY, I'LL MEET YOU THERE.

324
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:43,512
I JUST HAVE TO BREAK DOWN 
THE SALAD BAR AND

325
00:12:43,512 --> 00:12:45,806
SET UP THE LEATHER PONY.

326
00:12:45,806 --> 00:12:47,057
- WHAT'S A LEATHER PONY?

327
00:12:47,057 --> 00:12:50,685
- I DON'T KNOW. 
WE DON'T HAVE THAT AT LUNCH.

328
00:12:50,685 --> 00:12:52,146
narrator: 
SO MICHAEL CALLED LINDSAY

329
00:12:52,146 --> 00:12:54,982
TO SAY HE'D FOUND HER HUSBAND.

330
00:12:54,982 --> 00:12:56,233
- ALL RIGHT, I'M ON MY WAY.

331
00:12:56,233 --> 00:12:58,402
- NO, NO. I'LL JUST BRING 
HIM BACK WITH ME.

332
00:12:58,402 --> 00:13:00,946
- HE WANTS TO COME HOME? 
- I MEAN, AGAINST HIS WILL.

333
00:13:00,946 --> 00:13:03,573
- WELL, KNOCK HIM OUT IF YOU 
HAVE TO. HE'S MY HUSBAND!

334
00:13:03,573 --> 00:13:06,285
- JUST WATCH THE KIDS 
LIKE YOU PROMISED, OKAY?

335
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:08,829
- I'M NOT-- 
- NEITHER AM I!

336
00:13:08,829 --> 00:13:10,831
- HOLD IT.

337
00:13:10,831 --> 00:13:13,083
narrator: AND THE KIDS FOUND 
THEMSELVES CLOSER THAN EVER

338
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:14,709
ON THE BUMPY ROAD TO RENO.

339
00:13:14,709 --> 00:13:16,879
[cell phone ringing] 
- HELLO?

340
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:18,130
- LINDSAY, HEY, HI.

341
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:21,508
MICHAEL SAID NOT TO CALL YOU, 
BUT I MISS YOU SO MUCH.

342
00:13:21,508 --> 00:13:23,510
- YOU MISS ME?

343
00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:24,761
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

344
00:13:24,761 --> 00:13:25,971
- NOTHING. 
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

345
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:27,639
- I WAS DRIVING OUT THERE, 
BUT THIS IS CRAZY.

346
00:13:27,639 --> 00:13:29,934
WE HAVE TO BE REALISTIC.

347
00:13:29,934 --> 00:13:31,977
- BUT, NO, NO, THE THING IS, 
I CAN'T LEAVE KITTY.

348
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:35,189
WHAT, WITH ALL THE SEXUAL 
INTERCOURSE AND WHATNOT.

349
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:37,607
- YOU BASTARD! 
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

350
00:13:37,607 --> 00:13:39,985
- NOTHING! 
- I WILL BE BACKSTAGE...

351
00:13:39,985 --> 00:13:42,321
AFTER THE BLUE MAN SHOW 
WHETHER KITTY LIKES IT OR NOT.

352
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:44,448
- SOUNDS GOOD. 
ONE QUICK QUESTION.

353
00:13:44,448 --> 00:13:45,699
WHAT IF KITTY'S NOT THERE

354
00:13:45,699 --> 00:13:49,328
AND I'M LESS OF A BLUE MAN 
AND MORE OF A COCKTAIL WAITRESS?

355
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:51,788
- SHE'S TURNING AGAIN. 
- HANG UP!

356
00:13:51,788 --> 00:13:53,540
- I'LL SEE YOU THERE. 
THANK YOU. BYE.

357
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:55,375
narrator: MICHAEL WAS ALREADY AT 
THE THEATER

358
00:13:55,375 --> 00:13:56,418
LOOKING FOR GEORGE SR,

359
00:13:56,418 --> 00:13:59,254
WHEN HE RAN INTO BARRY 
DOING THE SAME THING.

360
00:13:59,254 --> 00:14:00,505
- HEY! BARRY.

361
00:14:00,505 --> 00:14:02,841
- HI, MIKEY. 
SO, HOW MUCH DO YOU KNOW?

362
00:14:02,841 --> 00:14:04,093
- I KNOW THAT OSCAR IS IN 
PRISON,

363
00:14:04,093 --> 00:14:06,095
AND THAT MY FATHER 
IS A BLUE MAN,

364
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:07,846
AND THAT YOU ARE CLEARLY 
IN CAHOOTS WITH HIM.

365
00:14:07,846 --> 00:14:09,556
- OOH, A LOT.

366
00:14:09,556 --> 00:14:11,516
- WHERE IS HE? 
I DON'T KNOW.

367
00:14:11,516 --> 00:14:13,643
I WAS GONNA MEET HIM HERE, BUT 
HE MUST'VE SEEN YOU AND RUN OFF.

368
00:14:13,643 --> 00:14:17,647
I WAS GONNA GIVE HIM THIS-- 
$250,000 AND A PASSPORT.

369
00:14:17,647 --> 00:14:21,318
- JUST A PASSPORT. 
- WELL, I WAS UP FOR SO LONG.

370
00:14:21,318 --> 00:14:25,197
- BARRY, YOU'RE FIRED. 
- WHAT?

371
00:14:25,197 --> 00:14:27,657
- YEAH. 
- JUST LIKE THAT?

372
00:14:27,657 --> 00:14:29,784
NO WARNING? 
YOU'RE MY ONLY CLIENT.

373
00:14:29,784 --> 00:14:32,537
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO NOW, 
TURN TRICKS ON THE STREET?

374
00:14:32,537 --> 00:14:33,956
HOW MUCH YOU THINK I CAN GET 
FOR THAT BY THE WAY?

375
00:14:33,956 --> 00:14:35,040
- THIS IS CRAZY.

376
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,041
I'VE GOT TO LET 
OSCAR OUT OF PRISON.

377
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:37,376
- WHAT ABOUT MAKING OUT?

378
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:42,297
FIFTY DOLLARS, OR IS THAT JUST 
L.A.? AM I JUST--

379
00:14:45,675 --> 00:14:48,678
narrator: SOON, LINDSAY ARRIVED 
AT THE HOTEL,

380
00:14:48,678 --> 00:14:51,306
AND THE KIDS 
FINALLY FACED FACTS.

381
00:14:51,306 --> 00:14:52,557
- LOOK, IT WAS JUST A HALF KISS.

382
00:14:52,557 --> 00:14:55,394
MAYBE THAT'S THE REASON 
WHY WE'RE ACTING WEIRD.

383
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:58,605
- IT WAS BECAUSE WE DIDN'T 
FINISH THE KISS? IS THAT WHAT--

384
00:14:58,605 --> 00:15:00,565
- YEAH. DO YOU THINK WE SHOULD 
JUST FINISH THE KISS?

385
00:15:00,565 --> 00:15:01,733
GET IT OUT OF THE WAY.

386
00:15:01,733 --> 00:15:04,945
- LET'S GET IT OUT OF THE WAY.

387
00:15:04,945 --> 00:15:07,156
- HEY, KIDS, BRING THE BAGS. 
WE'RE SHARING A ROOM.

388
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:08,949
- ALRIGHT, LET'S MEET BACK HERE 
TOMORROW MORNING, OKAY?

389
00:15:08,949 --> 00:15:10,367
- YEAH.

390
00:15:10,367 --> 00:15:11,618
- GO.

391
00:15:11,618 --> 00:15:13,913
- ARE YOU-- 
YEAH, I'M GONNA--

392
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:18,000
I'M GONNA STAY OUT HERE AND 
WATCH THAT FAMOUS RENO SUNSET.

393
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:22,796
- ISN'T IT BEHIND YOU?

394
00:15:22,796 --> 00:15:24,339
- THERE'S-- 
YEAH, BUT THERE'S MIRRORS.

395
00:15:24,339 --> 00:15:26,383
IT'LL ACTUALLY LOOK CLOSER.

396
00:15:26,383 --> 00:15:29,219
narrator: WHILE GEORGE MICHAEL 
WAITED FOR THE SUNSET,

397
00:15:29,219 --> 00:15:31,471
ANOTHER SET OF SONS ARRIVED.

398
00:15:31,471 --> 00:15:32,722
- MICHAEL SAID HE'D MEET 
ME HERE.

399
00:15:32,722 --> 00:15:35,559
I'LL GET THE KEYS 
TO THE CABIN, SON.

400
00:15:35,559 --> 00:15:40,564
- I'LL GO BUY SOME 
FISHING STUFF, SON.

401
00:15:40,564 --> 00:15:41,815
- SO, WHERE DID YOU 
GET THIS KID?

402
00:15:41,815 --> 00:15:43,400
- YEAH, 
I GUESS I CAN TELL YOU NOW.

403
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,235
WE WERE BOTH WAITING FOR 
OUR DADS AT THAT GARDEN

404
00:15:45,235 --> 00:15:46,987
WHERE THE LITTLE BOY 
FOUND THE ARM.

405
00:15:46,987 --> 00:15:48,238
KID'S AMAZING, THOUGH.

406
00:15:48,238 --> 00:15:51,658
IT'S ALMOST LIKE... 
I WISH HE COULD BE MY DAD.

407
00:15:51,658 --> 00:15:55,245
- OKAY, UM, YOUR DAD'S NOT 
TRYING TO FIND YOU, YOUR SON IS.

408
00:15:55,245 --> 00:15:57,747
THAT KID'S YOUR SON. 
YOU'RE THE DAD, HMM?

409
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:06,756
- I'VE MADE A HUGE 
TINY MISTAKE.

410
00:16:06,756 --> 00:16:08,092
- GOB. 
YOU CAN'T JUST LEAVE YOUR SON

411
00:16:08,092 --> 00:16:10,552
IN THE MIDDLE 
OF A PARKING LOT IN RENO.

412
00:16:10,552 --> 00:16:12,512
narrator: AND THAT'S 
WHEN MICHAEL SAW HIS OWN SON

413
00:16:12,512 --> 00:16:14,473
IN A PARKING LOT IN RENO.

414
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:18,018
- HE DROVE ALL THE WAY UP HERE 
TO BE WITH ME. WOW.

415
00:16:18,018 --> 00:16:21,480
WELL, I GUESS I'M, UH-- 
I'M NO BETTER THAN--

416
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:25,400
NO, I'M BETTER.

417
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:26,860
narrator: 
THEY WERE AN HOUR OUT OF RENO

418
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:28,695
WHEN GEORGE MICHAEL WOKE UP.

419
00:16:28,695 --> 00:16:29,946
- YOU WERE OUT LIKE A LIGHT, 
PAL.

420
00:16:29,946 --> 00:16:31,740
OUR DREAMS ARE ABOUT 
TO COME TRUE.

421
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:33,783
- MAEBY? 
- DEFINITELY!

422
00:16:33,783 --> 00:16:37,454
WE ARE GOING CAMPING. 
IT'S FINALLY HAPPENING.

423
00:16:37,454 --> 00:16:39,623
- IT'S NEVER HAPPENING.

424
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:45,629
narrator: MICHAEL HAD JUST 
SURPRISED HIS SLEEPING SON

425
00:16:45,629 --> 00:16:47,422
BY TAKING HIM CAMPING.

426
00:16:47,422 --> 00:16:49,924
- I PUT THIS OFF TOO LONG, 
AND IT'S TOO IMPORTANT.

427
00:16:49,924 --> 00:16:52,969
YOUR UNCLE OSCAR CAN STAY IN 
PRISON ONE MORE DAY, RIGHT?

428
00:16:52,969 --> 00:16:55,847
narrator: NOT ACCORDING TO THAT 
DAY'S BLOG ON IMOSCAR.COM.

429
00:16:55,847 --> 00:16:57,099
- THIS HERE IS WAY MORE 
IMPORTANT

430
00:16:57,099 --> 00:16:58,975
THAN ME TRYING TO FIND MY 
FATHER.

431
00:16:58,975 --> 00:17:03,022
ALTHOUGH, I WAS VERY CLOSE. 
I ALMOST HAD POP-POP IN RENO.

432
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:04,606
- ME TOO.

433
00:17:04,606 --> 00:17:06,275
narrator: 
AS MICHAEL WAS FORCIBLY TAKING

434
00:17:06,275 --> 00:17:08,443
HIS SON OUT TO THE CABIN,

435
00:17:08,443 --> 00:17:11,280
LUCILLE WAS READY TO FORCIBLY 
THROW HERS OUT.

436
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:14,324
[loud snoring]

437
00:17:22,082 --> 00:17:25,544
[snoring] 
- WELL, THAT WAS A FREEBIE.

438
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:27,171
narrator: LUCILLE DIDN'T 
TRUST HERSELF

439
00:17:27,171 --> 00:17:29,464
TO BE IN THE HOUSE 
WHEN BUSTER RETURNED.

440
00:17:29,464 --> 00:17:30,715
SO, SHE HEADED OFF 
TO THE CABIN

441
00:17:30,715 --> 00:17:33,135
MICHAEL SAID 
WOULD BE UNOCCUPIED.

442
00:17:33,135 --> 00:17:34,761
TOBIAS, MEANWHILE, 
WAS LOOKING FOR A WAY

443
00:17:34,761 --> 00:17:36,471
TO MAKE HIS WIFE JEALOUS...

444
00:17:36,471 --> 00:17:38,348
BY CONVINCING HER THAT 
HE WAS NOT ONLY A BLUE MAN,

445
00:17:38,348 --> 00:17:41,101
BUT STILL WITH KITTY,

446
00:17:41,101 --> 00:17:43,312
WHEN HE CAME ACROSS A MAKEUP 
WOMAN WHO, COINCIDENTALLY,

447
00:17:43,312 --> 00:17:45,439
LOOKED A GREAT DEAL LIKE KITTY.

448
00:17:45,439 --> 00:17:50,944
- IF THIS TABLEAU I RE-CREATE, 
PERHAPS I CAN RE-SNARE MY MATE.

449
00:17:50,944 --> 00:17:53,488
narrator: GEE, WHY WOULDN'T 
SHE WANT HIM BACK?

450
00:17:53,488 --> 00:17:59,035
AND MICHAEL AND HIS SON ARRIVED 
AT THE CABIN IN THE WOODS.

451
00:17:59,035 --> 00:18:01,913
- LOOKS LIKE THEY HAVE 
TRUCKED OFF THE BEDROOMS.

452
00:18:01,913 --> 00:18:03,582
MAYBE WE'LL JUST SET UP 
SOME SLEEPING BAGS

453
00:18:03,582 --> 00:18:05,959
RIGHT HERE 
IN THE LIVING ROOM, HUH?

454
00:18:05,959 --> 00:18:09,045
narrator: LUCILLE, MEANWHILE, 
HEARD A FAMILIAR SOUND.

455
00:18:09,045 --> 00:18:11,090
[snoring]

456
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:13,592
- OH, COME ON! 
- MOTHER?

457
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:16,511
- WHAT THE HELL ARE 
YOU DOING BACK THERE?

458
00:18:16,511 --> 00:18:17,762
- I DECIDED TO SLEEP IN THE CAR

459
00:18:17,762 --> 00:18:20,390
SO MY SNORING WOULDN'T 
BOTHER YOU,

460
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:21,933
AND I LEFT THAT RECORDING 
OF MY SNORING

461
00:18:21,933 --> 00:18:23,935
SO YOU WOULDN'T 
KNOW I'M GONE.

462
00:18:23,935 --> 00:18:25,187
- WE'RE HALFWAY TO THE CABIN.

463
00:18:25,187 --> 00:18:28,064
I'M GONNA DROP YOU 
BY THIS LIGHT.

464
00:18:28,064 --> 00:18:29,316
- OR I COULD COME WITH YOU.

465
00:18:29,316 --> 00:18:33,069
THAT MIGHT BE THE EXACT SHOT IN 
THE ARM OUR RELATIONSHIP NEEDS.

466
00:18:33,069 --> 00:18:35,114
- WELL, AT LEAST I'LL 
HAVE SOMEONE

467
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:37,491
TO TALK TO ON THE WAY UP.

468
00:18:37,491 --> 00:18:40,076
[snoring]

469
00:18:46,082 --> 00:18:47,334
- THIS IS FUN, ISN'T IT?

470
00:18:47,334 --> 00:18:50,420
THIS IS JUST LIKE WHEN WE USED 
TO LIVE UP IN THE ATTIC.

471
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:53,382
- YEAH.

472
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:56,092
OR--OR WE COULD 
GO BACK TO RENO.

473
00:18:56,092 --> 00:18:59,304
- GO BACK TO RENO? 
YOU DON'T WANNA BE HERE?

474
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:00,764
YOU'VE BEEN SLEEPING IN 
THE STAIR CAR

475
00:19:00,764 --> 00:19:03,475
JUST SO WE CAN 
SPEND TIME TOGETHER.

476
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:05,519
- THAT'S NOT TOTALLY TRUE 
THOUGH.

477
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:07,271
I'M JUST IN THE MIDDLE 
OF A PROBLEM RIGHT NOW.

478
00:19:07,271 --> 00:19:08,647
- OH, YEAH?

479
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:09,898
WELL, LET'S TALK ABOUT IT.

480
00:19:09,898 --> 00:19:11,316
- I CAN'T TALK ABOUT IT 
WITH YOU.

481
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:12,567
- WHY NOT?

482
00:19:12,567 --> 00:19:14,778
- IT'S ABOUT A GIRL, AND 
YOU'RE NOT GONNA LIKE THIS.

483
00:19:14,778 --> 00:19:16,696
- IS IT ABOUT ANN? 
- NO.

484
00:19:16,696 --> 00:19:19,283
- OH. 
OF COURSE I DON'T LIKE IT.

485
00:19:19,283 --> 00:19:24,329
I LIKE ANN. 
- NO, IT'S JUST--

486
00:19:24,329 --> 00:19:26,331
IT'S A PROBLEM 
WITHOUT AN ANSWER.

487
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:28,333
- WELL, EVERY PROBLEM 
HAS AN ANSWER.

488
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:29,584
YOU'RE PROBABLY JUST CONFUSED

489
00:19:29,584 --> 00:19:32,421
BECAUSE YOU'RE GOING THROUGH 
ALL OF THIS ALONE.

490
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:35,882
AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHY WE NEED 
TO SPEND THIS TIME TOGETHER.

491
00:19:35,882 --> 00:19:38,677
- YEAH, I GUESS SO. 
- I KNOW SO.

492
00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:40,136
SO HERE'S THE PLAN. 
TOMORROW MORNING

493
00:19:40,136 --> 00:19:41,596
WE'RE GONNA GET UP EARLY.

494
00:19:41,596 --> 00:19:45,099
BEFORE WE TELL THE COPS THAT 
POP-POP ESCAPED FROM PRISON,

495
00:19:45,099 --> 00:19:46,351
WE'RE GONNA GO DOWN TO THE LAKE,

496
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:48,853
DISCUSS YOUR GIRL PROBLEM, 
AND IT'S GONNA BE FUN.

497
00:19:48,853 --> 00:19:50,272
ESPECIALLY THE PART 
ABOUT THE COPS.

498
00:19:50,272 --> 00:19:51,731
ALL RIGHT?

499
00:19:51,731 --> 00:19:53,317
WHATEVER YOUR PROBLEM 
IS WITH THE GIRL,

500
00:19:53,317 --> 00:19:55,194
WE'RE GONNA FIGURE IT OUT.

501
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:57,404
THAT'S WHAT 
THIS PLACE IS FOR.

502
00:19:57,404 --> 00:19:59,698
THAT, AND CHEATING ON GANGY.

503
00:19:59,698 --> 00:20:01,366
- YOU KNOW, I'M REALLY GLAD YOU 
BROUGHT ME HERE, DAD.

504
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:03,452
- YEAH, WE NEEDED THIS.

505
00:20:03,452 --> 00:20:07,372
AND THIS TIME, I'M NOT GONNA 
LET THE FAMILY DRAG ME AWAY.

506
00:20:07,372 --> 00:20:08,623
narrator: THE NEXT MORNING,

507
00:20:08,623 --> 00:20:11,960
MICHAEL ROSE EARLY TO SPEND 
THE DAY WITH HIS SON,

508
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,712
ONLY TO FIND HIMSELF, 
ONCE AGAIN,

509
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:17,632
DRAGGED AWAY BY HIS FAMILY.

510
00:20:17,632 --> 00:20:20,344
- DAD! WHAT THE HELL 
ARE YOU DOING?

511
00:20:20,344 --> 00:20:21,595
- SORRY.

512
00:20:21,595 --> 00:20:24,514
I CAN'T LET YOU LET OSCAR OUT OF 
PRISON OR THEY'LL COME FOR ME.

513
00:20:24,514 --> 00:20:28,518
HEY, HOW DO YOU LIKE 
THE CABIN?

514
00:20:34,316 --> 00:20:36,526
narrator: ON THE NEXT 
ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT.

515
00:20:36,526 --> 00:20:38,737
LUCILLE ARRIVES AT THE CABIN.

516
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:41,240
- [bleep] ME. 
THERE'S NO CABIN.

517
00:20:44,784 --> 00:20:47,161
- MOTHER? 
- OH, MY GOD!

518
00:20:47,161 --> 00:20:48,622
YOU STILL DOING 
BREAKFAST BURRITOS?

519
00:20:48,622 --> 00:20:51,040
[loud splash]

520
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:53,001
narrator: MAEBY FINDS SOMEONE TO 
HELP HER FORGET HER COUSIN.

521
00:20:53,001 --> 00:20:55,169
- BEING STOOD UP. 
- YEAH, ME TOO.

522
00:20:55,169 --> 00:20:56,255
narrator: HER COUSIN.

523
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:58,673
- WANNA MAKE OUT? 
- YEAH, SURE. WHY NOT?

524
00:20:58,673 --> 00:21:01,260
narrator: AND LINDSAY CATCHES UP 
WITH TOBIAS.

525
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:05,138
- GET YOUR HANDS OFF 
MY HUSBAND, KITTY.

526
00:21:05,138 --> 00:21:09,351
- DID SOMEONE SAY "HUSBAND"?

527
00:21:09,351 --> 00:21:10,852
- I WANT A DIVORCE.

528
00:21:10,852 --> 00:21:14,773
- AND I WOULD BE THRILLED TO 
REPRESENT EITHER ONE OF YOU.

529
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:17,108
THAT'LL BE $50.
