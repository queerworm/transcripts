00:00:01,376 --> 00:00:03,002
male narrator: NOW THE STORY 
OF A WEALTHY FAMILY

2
00:00:03,002 --> 00:00:04,212
WHO LOST EVERYTHING

3
00:00:04,212 --> 00:00:06,297
AND THE ONE SON 
WHO HAD NO CHOICE

4
00:00:06,297 --> 00:00:07,923
BUT TO KEEP THEM ALL TOGETHER.

5
00:00:13,804 --> 00:00:15,640
IT'S "ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT."

6
00:00:19,727 --> 00:00:21,562
MICHAEL BLUTH 
WAS WORKING AT HOME

7
00:00:21,562 --> 00:00:24,274
WHEN HIS SON 
MADE A CURIOUS REQUEST.

8
00:00:24,274 --> 00:00:25,483
- DAD, WOULD ANYONE 
MISS THIS

9
00:00:25,483 --> 00:00:27,360
PETER AND THE WOLF 
READ-ALONG RECORD?

10
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:28,944
- NO, ACTUALLY, 
I THINK THAT'S PART OF

11
00:00:28,944 --> 00:00:29,133
THE MODEL HOME DECORATIONS.

12
00:00:29,133 --> 00:00:31,239
WHY? 
- YOU'RE RIGHT.

13
00:00:31,239 --> 00:00:32,740
MY GIRLFRIEND ANN WANTS TO HAVE

14
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:34,200
A CHRISTIAN MUSIC BONFIRE HERE.

15
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,119
- THAT SOUNDS LIKE 
SOME MILD FUN.

16
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:37,703
I THINK WE'VE GOT 
SOME CHRISTMAS MUSIC.

17
00:00:37,703 --> 00:00:40,581
- OH, NO. IT'S NOT--IT'S NOT 
A "CHRISTIAN MUSIC" BONFIRE.

18
00:00:40,581 --> 00:00:42,208
IT'S A CHRISTIAN 
"MUSIC BONFIRE."

19
00:00:42,208 --> 00:00:44,252
YOU KNOW, WE BURN 
ALL SATANIC MUSIC.

20
00:00:44,252 --> 00:00:45,149
THE THING IS, THOUGH, 
THE ONLY MUSIC I HAVE

21
00:00:45,149 --> 00:00:47,338
IS EITHER INSTRUCTIONAL 
OR HUMOR.

22
00:00:47,338 --> 00:00:49,465
narrator: HE'D BEEN PARTICULARLY 
FOND OF A CD

23
00:00:49,465 --> 00:00:51,759
OF SOMETHING CALLED 
THE JERKY BOYS.

24
00:00:51,759 --> 00:00:52,802
- HELLO.

25
00:00:52,802 --> 00:00:54,137
- HEY, NITZ. 
HEY, JERKY.

26
00:00:54,137 --> 00:00:55,305
I WANT TO BUY A HOUSE, DAD.

27
00:00:55,305 --> 00:00:56,347
IT'S GOT TO BE BIG.

28
00:00:56,347 --> 00:00:58,349
- YOU--YOU SAID "DAD," BUDDY.

29
00:00:58,349 --> 00:01:00,060
- SHUT UP, JERKY.

30
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:01,561
[dial tone]

31
00:01:01,561 --> 00:01:03,771
- [laughing]

32
00:01:03,771 --> 00:01:05,231
- HEY, GEORGE MICHAEL, 
JESUS CALLED.

33
00:01:05,231 --> 00:01:07,067
HE WANTS YOUR "THRILLER" ALBUM.

34
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:09,694
- YEAH, I DON'T THINK THE 
BONFIRE IS SUCH A GREAT IDEA.

35
00:01:09,694 --> 00:01:12,072
- I KNOW IT MIGHT BE WEIRD, 
BUT ANN'S MY GIRLFRIEND,

36
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:14,740
SO I THINK I'LL GO 
BUY SOME ALBUMS TODAY.

37
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:16,784
HEY, CAN YOU COVER FOR ME 
AT THE BANANA STAND IF I--

38
00:01:18,328 --> 00:01:19,412
- NO.

39
00:01:19,412 --> 00:01:20,538
- I'LL COVER FOR YOU, PAL.

40
00:01:20,538 --> 00:01:22,165
IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME 
SINCE I'VE BEEN DOWN

41
00:01:22,165 --> 00:01:23,166
AT THAT BANANA STAND.

42
00:01:23,166 --> 00:01:24,167
- OH, OKAY. 
GOOD.

43
00:01:24,167 --> 00:01:26,794
IT'S THE ONLY WAY WE'RE EVER 
GONNA GET IT AIR-CONDITIONED.

44
00:01:26,794 --> 00:01:28,504
- MICHAEL!

45
00:01:28,504 --> 00:01:30,840
HOW WOULD YOU LIKE ME 
TO OWE YOU A FAVOR?

46
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:33,968
I WANT YOU TO BID ON ME AT 
THE CHARITY AUCTION THIS YEAR.

47
00:01:33,968 --> 00:01:36,471
- OKAY, NOW I'D LIKE TO USE UP 
MY FAVOR AND DECLINE.

48
00:01:36,471 --> 00:01:37,513
- [sighs]

49
00:01:37,513 --> 00:01:38,973
- AND ISN'T THAT 
BUSTER'S ANNUAL JOB?

50
00:01:38,973 --> 00:01:41,642
- YES, BUT I CAN'T HAVE 
A REPLAY OF LAST YEAR.

51
00:01:41,642 --> 00:01:44,562
narrator: WHEN BUSTER 
INADVERTENTLY BID ON LUCILLE 2.

52
00:01:44,562 --> 00:01:46,314
- $10,000!

53
00:01:46,314 --> 00:01:48,108
- BUSTER.

54
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:49,192
- [shrieks]

55
00:01:49,192 --> 00:01:51,486
- AND YOU'RE EMBARRASSED 
TO HAVE OSCAR BID ON YOU.

56
00:01:51,486 --> 00:01:52,737
- WITH HIS TWO PAIR OF PANTS?

57
00:01:52,737 --> 00:01:53,863
YOU BET.

58
00:01:53,863 --> 00:01:55,406
- OH, HI, MOM.

59
00:01:55,406 --> 00:01:57,367
I HAVE THE AFTERNOON FREE.

60
00:01:57,367 --> 00:01:58,368
- REALLY?

61
00:01:58,368 --> 00:01:59,219
DID NOTHING CANCEL?

62
00:02:00,786 --> 00:02:02,622
- ALL RIGHT. 
I NEED TO BORROW A FUR.

63
00:02:02,622 --> 00:02:04,165
- I THOUGHT YOU WERE ANTIFUR, 
LINDSAY.

64
00:02:04,165 --> 00:02:06,709
IN FACT, WEREN'T YOU PROTESTING 
SOME HUNTER GUN THING YESTERDAY?

65
00:02:06,709 --> 00:02:08,919
- I STOPPED BY. 
I HADN'T CHOSEN A SIDE.

66
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:11,256
- MURDERERS! 
YOU'RE ALL MURDERERS!

67
00:02:11,256 --> 00:02:14,234
- THERE ARE PLENTY OF RULES 
ABOUT GUNS ALREADY ON THE BOOKS.

68
00:02:14,234 --> 00:02:17,428
YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED 
TO SELL A GUN TO A KID.

69
00:02:17,428 --> 00:02:19,639
YOU'RE NOT EVEN ALLOWED 
TO FIRE YOUR GUN IN THE AIR...

70
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:20,806
- ISN'T THAT FRANK WRENCH?

71
00:02:20,806 --> 00:02:22,475
- ON THE FOURTH OF JULY.

72
00:02:22,475 --> 00:02:25,520
narrator: IN FACT, IT WAS 
PEOPLE'S CHOICE NOMINATED ACTOR

73
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,230
MOSES TAYLOR,

74
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:30,525
FAMOUS FOR HIS PORTRAYAL 
OF THE RULE-ABIDING DETECTIVE...

75
00:02:30,525 --> 00:02:32,610
- STOP SIGN. 
narrator: FRANK WRENCH.

76
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:35,738
STAR OF THE TELEVISION SHOW 
"WRENCH."

77
00:02:35,738 --> 00:02:38,115
- WELL, THAT'S ONE RULE 
I'M NOT GONNA FOLLOW.

78
00:02:38,115 --> 00:02:40,160
[crowd screams]

79
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,828
THAT'S THE SECOND AMENDMENT. 
READ IT.

80
00:02:42,828 --> 00:02:44,414
- WHAT DO YOU NEED 
WITH ONE OF MOM'S FURS?

81
00:02:44,414 --> 00:02:47,667
- I'M COLD. 
- SO AM I.

82
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:49,544
- NO. 
- ALL RIGHT, LOOK.

83
00:02:49,544 --> 00:02:51,254
I MET MOSES TAYLOR.

84
00:02:51,254 --> 00:02:53,005
WE'RE HAVING A DATE 
IN THE PARK TOMORROW.

85
00:02:53,005 --> 00:02:55,216
TRY TO GET HIM TO BID ON YOU 
AT THE AUCTION TOMORROW,

86
00:02:55,216 --> 00:02:56,801
BECAUSE MICHAEL CAN'T.

87
00:02:56,801 --> 00:02:58,553
HE'S BIDDING ON MOTHER.

88
00:02:58,553 --> 00:02:59,804
- EXCEPT THAT I'M NOT.

89
00:02:59,804 --> 00:03:00,805
NOW, IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,

90
00:03:00,805 --> 00:03:02,265
I'M GONNA GO WORK 
IN THE BANANA STAND.

91
00:03:02,265 --> 00:03:06,519
- AND I'M GONNA SEE IF I CAN 
GET A WRENCH TO STRIP MY NUTS.

92
00:03:07,645 --> 00:03:09,188
I WAS TRYING TO BE SEXY.

93
00:03:09,188 --> 00:03:11,357
IT JUST GOT AWAY FROM ME.

94
00:03:11,357 --> 00:03:13,609
- IT'S BACHELORETTE SEASON 
IN NEWPORT BEACH,

95
00:03:13,609 --> 00:03:16,279
AND SOME LOVELY LADIES 
ARE UP FOR AUCTION.

96
00:03:16,279 --> 00:03:18,197
PLUS, ANOTHER WOLF SIGHTING 
IN THE PARK.

97
00:03:18,197 --> 00:03:19,532
WHAT THAT MEANS 
FOR YOUR WEEKEND.

98
00:03:19,532 --> 00:03:21,409
- BAD NEWS, MICHAEL.

99
00:03:21,409 --> 00:03:25,162
I'M AFRAID THE BLUE MAN GROUP 
AND I HAVE PARTED WAYS.

100
00:03:25,162 --> 00:03:29,375
SEEMS I'M OFFICIALLY NO LONGER 
A STANDBY UNDERSTUDY.

101
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:31,168
- "CEASE AND DESIST."

102
00:03:31,168 --> 00:03:33,212
- SEEMS THEY DON'T 
APPRECIATE COMPETITION.

103
00:03:33,212 --> 00:03:35,298
narrator: TOBIAS HAD RECENTLY 
TAKEN OUT AN AD

104
00:03:35,298 --> 00:03:38,259
IN A TRADE MAGAZINE 
FOR A ONE-MAN SHOW.

105
00:03:38,259 --> 00:03:40,428
- AND THE WORST PART 
IS LINDSAY'S OUT THERE

106
00:03:40,428 --> 00:03:42,555
CHASING SOME SUCCESSFUL ACTOR.

107
00:03:42,555 --> 00:03:44,181
TELEVISION'S FRANK WRENCH.

108
00:03:44,181 --> 00:03:47,268
I NEED TO PROVE TO HER 
THAT I'M NOT JUST A MAN,

109
00:03:47,268 --> 00:03:48,978
BUT A MAN'S MAN.

110
00:03:48,978 --> 00:03:50,521
- WELL, I THINK SHE KNOWS THAT.

111
00:03:50,521 --> 00:03:51,522
[wolflike howling]

112
00:03:51,522 --> 00:03:52,732
- JESUS! IT'S THE WOLF!

113
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:54,775
THAT IS THE WOLF! 
THE WOLF IS UPSTAIRS!

114
00:03:54,775 --> 00:03:58,195
- I THINK IT'S JUST MY SON'S 
PETER AND THE WOLF RECORD.

115
00:03:58,195 --> 00:04:00,448
- I THOUGHT THAT WAS 
A HOMEFILL.

116
00:04:00,448 --> 00:04:02,992
narrator: MICHAEL WENT 
TO CHECK ON HIS FUGITIVE FATHER,

117
00:04:02,992 --> 00:04:04,494
WHO WAS LIVING IN THE ATTIC.

118
00:04:04,494 --> 00:04:05,703
- YOU HEARD MY CALL?

119
00:04:05,703 --> 00:04:07,288
- HAVE YOU BEEN DOING THAT 
ALL OVER TOWN?

120
00:04:07,288 --> 00:04:08,914
BECAUSE PEOPLE THINK THAT 
THERE'S A WOLF ON THE LOOSE.

121
00:04:08,914 --> 00:04:10,541
- YES, THERE IS A WOLF 
ON THE LOOSE,

122
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:11,351
AND HIS NAME IS OSCAR.

123
00:04:11,351 --> 00:04:14,086
TELL ME HE'S NOT GONNA BE 
BIDDING ON YOUR MOTHER

124
00:04:14,086 --> 00:04:16,256
AT THAT CHARITY AUCTION 
WITH MY MONEY.

125
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:17,882
- IS THAT WHY YOU 
CALLED ME UP HERE, DAD?

126
00:04:17,882 --> 00:04:19,091
BECAUSE YOU ARE A FUGITIVE,

127
00:04:19,091 --> 00:04:21,093
AND AS FAR AS SHE KNOWS, 
YOU'RE IN ANOTHER COUNTRY.

128
00:04:21,093 --> 00:04:22,470
- IT'S DRIVING ME CRAZY.

129
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:24,889
THEY'RE PARADING IN PUBLIC.

130
00:04:24,889 --> 00:04:27,267
MY BACK IS--IT'S IN KNOTS.

131
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:29,269
I HAVEN'T HAD A MASSAGE 
SINCE PRISON.

132
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:30,853
- HOPE THAT WAS FORCED.

133
00:04:30,853 --> 00:04:33,398
- BUT THEN I FOUND A WAY TO 
FIX MY BACK IN THIS OLD CATALOG.

134
00:04:33,398 --> 00:04:34,690
LOOK AT THIS HOT TUB.

135
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:36,191
I COULD USE IT 
FOR SO MANY THINGS.

136
00:04:36,191 --> 00:04:38,110
IT COULD BE MY, YOU KNOW, 
WATER SUPPLY.

137
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:41,656
AND THOSE, UH, PREMADE 
BOIL-IN-BAG MEALS--

138
00:04:41,656 --> 00:04:43,240
YOU JUST TOSS THOSE IN THERE.

139
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,325
- YOU'RE NOT GETTING 
A HOT TUB.

140
00:04:44,325 --> 00:04:45,326
- AH, COME ON. 
PLEASE!

141
00:04:45,326 --> 00:04:47,202
- DAD, PLEASE. 
WE CAN'T AFFORD THAT.

142
00:04:47,202 --> 00:04:48,788
WE'RE IN THIS MESS 
BECAUSE OF YOU.

143
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:50,205
I'M WORKING DOWN AT 
THE BANANA STAND

144
00:04:50,205 --> 00:04:51,541
JUST SO THAT WE DON'T 
LOSE A SHIFT.

145
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:53,959
WE'RE DONE PAMPERING OURSELVES 
IN THIS FAMILY.

146
00:04:55,336 --> 00:04:58,756
YEAH, I WOULD LIKE THE BIGGEST 
AIR-CONDITIONER YOU'VE GOT.

147
00:04:58,756 --> 00:05:00,675
NO, NO, NOT TOMORROW. 
I NEED--

148
00:05:00,675 --> 00:05:02,593
I NEED IT TODAY. 
I'M NOT HERE TOMORROW.

149
00:05:02,718 --> 00:05:04,762
narrator: JUST THEN, 
MICHAEL RAN INTO A WOMAN

150
00:05:04,762 --> 00:05:06,055
WHOM HE HADN'T SEEN IN YEARS.

151
00:05:06,055 --> 00:05:07,765
- MICHAEL?

152
00:05:07,765 --> 00:05:09,892
- SALLY SITWELL.

153
00:05:09,892 --> 00:05:12,603
narrator: MICHAEL HAD ALWAYS 
BEEN IN LOVE WITH SALLY SITWELL.

154
00:05:12,603 --> 00:05:14,188
- WE COULD STEAL A GOLF CART.

155
00:05:14,188 --> 00:05:15,565
- NO, THEY KEEP 'EM 
LOCKED UP.

156
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:17,567
I KNOW, 'CAUSE I HAVE A KEY.

157
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:19,068
- I'LL GO GET MY SWEATER.

158
00:05:19,068 --> 00:05:20,861
- OH, SO YOU WANNA 
USE THE KEY.

159
00:05:20,861 --> 00:05:23,280
narrator: BUT HIS FATHER 
HAD A LONGTIME COMPETITION

160
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,407
WITH HER FATHER.

161
00:05:24,407 --> 00:05:25,783
IT LOOKS LIKE MY BOY IS GONNA BE

162
00:05:25,783 --> 00:05:27,743
STICKING IT TO YOUR DAUGHTER, 
SITWELL.

163
00:05:27,743 --> 00:05:28,828
STICK IT TO HER.

164
00:05:29,286 --> 00:05:30,287
STICK IT TO HER.

165
00:05:30,287 --> 00:05:32,665
narrator: AS A RESULT, 
MICHAEL WAS AWKWARD AROUND HER.

166
00:05:32,665 --> 00:05:35,835
- SHOULD WE GO OR... 
STICK AROUND?

167
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:37,920
NO, WE'RE NOT GONNA BE 
STICKING ANYTHING,

168
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,213
NOT--NOT GONNA STICK A THING.

169
00:05:39,213 --> 00:05:41,757
narrator: SINCE THEN, 
HE'D ALWAYS BEEN EAGER

170
00:05:41,757 --> 00:05:43,551
TO SHOW HER 
THAT HE'D BECOME A MAN.

171
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:44,927
- ARE YOU STILL WORKING HERE?

172
00:05:44,927 --> 00:05:47,221
- NO, NO, NO. 
FILLING IN FOR MY SON.

173
00:05:47,221 --> 00:05:50,099
- MICHAEL, AND-- 
WOW.

174
00:05:50,099 --> 00:05:51,434
SALLY.

175
00:05:51,434 --> 00:05:53,728
STICKWELL. 
- RIGHT.

176
00:05:53,728 --> 00:05:56,355
BECAUSE THE GUYS WANTED TO 
STICK IT TO ME.

177
00:05:56,355 --> 00:05:57,356
- WHAT? NO.

178
00:05:57,356 --> 00:05:58,357
- I NEVER--

179
00:05:58,357 --> 00:06:00,401
- MICHAEL USED TO SAY THAT. 
- NO, I DID NOT.

180
00:06:00,401 --> 00:06:02,737
- WELL, YOU SAID OTHER STUFF. 
- I ABSOLUTELY DID NOT SAY THAT.

181
00:06:02,737 --> 00:06:03,463
- MAN, HE LOVED YOU.

182
00:06:03,463 --> 00:06:05,656
- SO, GOB, TELL ME,

183
00:06:05,656 --> 00:06:07,617
ARE YOU STILL DOING 
YOUR LITTLE TRICKS?

184
00:06:07,617 --> 00:06:09,869
DO YOU CONSIDER THIS 
TO BE A LITTLE TRICK?

185
00:06:10,703 --> 00:06:11,704
- OH.

186
00:06:11,704 --> 00:06:13,831
DID YOU JUST SQUIRT ME 
WITH SOMETHING?

187
00:06:13,831 --> 00:06:16,834
- IT'S LIGHTER FLUID. 
DIDN'T PUT IN A NEW FLINT.

188
00:06:16,834 --> 00:06:20,421
BUT STILL, WHERE DID 
THE LIGHTER FLUID COME FROM?

189
00:06:21,088 --> 00:06:22,507
- WELL, THAT'S [bleep] GREAT.

190
00:06:22,507 --> 00:06:25,384
- MICHAEL, MAYBE I'LL SEE YOU 
OVER AT THE CLUB.

191
00:06:25,384 --> 00:06:28,303
WE NEVER REALLY TOOK 
THAT CART RIDE, DID WE?

192
00:06:28,303 --> 00:06:29,388
- AND WE NEVER WILL,

193
00:06:29,388 --> 00:06:31,724
'CAUSE I'M NOT THERE.

194
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:33,392
NOR AM I HERE.

195
00:06:33,392 --> 00:06:33,493
I MEAN, I'M HERE TODAY.

196
00:06:33,493 --> 00:06:35,770
- I'M GONNA GO.

197
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:37,062
- OKAY. 
- OKAY.

198
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:41,442
- SMOOTH, MICHAEL,

199
00:06:41,442 --> 00:06:44,945
LIKE HER FATHER'S HEAD, 
CHEST, ARMS, LEGS, AND ASS.

200
00:06:44,945 --> 00:06:46,071
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKIN' ABOUT?

201
00:06:46,071 --> 00:06:47,823
- HE'S HAIRLESS, MICHAEL. 
IT'S A CONDITION.

202
00:06:47,823 --> 00:06:49,742
I HATE THE GUY, 
BUT AT LEAST HE'S GOT [bleep].

203
00:06:49,742 --> 00:06:51,410
SATINY AND SMOOTH, PROBABLY.

204
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:53,037
- WELL, I'M JUST DIFFERENT 
THAN YOU, GOB.

205
00:06:53,037 --> 00:06:56,248
I'M NOT GONNA, YOU KNOW, SIPHON 
GAS OUT OF SOME GIRL'S CAR

206
00:06:56,248 --> 00:06:57,500
LIKE YOU USED TO IN HIGH SCHOOL,

207
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,043
JUST SO YOU CAN SHOW UP 
AND SAY,

208
00:06:59,043 --> 00:07:00,127
"CAR TROUBLES?"

209
00:07:00,127 --> 00:07:01,921
- IT'S CALLED TAKING ADVANTAGE.

210
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:03,422
IT'S WHAT GETS YOU AHEAD 
IN LIFE.

211
00:07:03,422 --> 00:07:06,801
- LIKE YOU DID WITH OUR BIGGEST 
SHAREHOLDER, LUCILLE AUSTERO.

212
00:07:06,801 --> 00:07:08,260
- THAT WAS A ONE-TIME THING, 
MICHAEL.

213
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:09,261
IT'S OVER.

214
00:07:09,261 --> 00:07:10,721
narrator: 
IT WAS FAR FROM OVER.

215
00:07:10,721 --> 00:07:13,933
- SHALL I PUT THE POSTUREPEDIC 
IN THE DOWN POSITION?

216
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:15,476
- LET'S ELEVATE THE KNEES 
THIS TIME.

217
00:07:15,476 --> 00:07:17,102
[laughter]

218
00:07:17,102 --> 00:07:19,063
AND YOU JUST LET 
SALLY SITWELL SLIP AWAY

219
00:07:19,063 --> 00:07:20,648
RIGHT WHEN SHE 
WAS READY TO GO,

220
00:07:20,648 --> 00:07:21,649
AND YOU WERE SCARED.

221
00:07:21,649 --> 00:07:22,775
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

222
00:07:22,775 --> 00:07:23,984
- [clucking]

223
00:07:23,984 --> 00:07:24,985
- COME ON.

224
00:07:24,985 --> 00:07:27,447
YOU GONNA GET OFF 
AND DO YOUR LITTLE DANCE TOO?

225
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:28,906
- NO, I...

226
00:07:28,906 --> 00:07:31,033
HURT MY ANKLE YESTERDAY 
SHOOTING HOOPS OR SOMETHING.

227
00:07:31,033 --> 00:07:33,453
[clucking]

228
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:34,954
OH, GOD. 
MY ANKLE.

229
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:35,955
- DON'T MOVE. 
LET ME--

230
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:37,665
- NO, NO, NO. 
IT'S BAD. IT'S BAD.

231
00:07:37,665 --> 00:07:39,792
- MOTHER! MOTHER! 
- BUSTER, IT HURTS.

232
00:07:39,792 --> 00:07:41,418
narrator: MICHAEL DECIDED 
THAT PERHAPS

233
00:07:41,418 --> 00:07:43,420
HE SHOULD GO AFTER SALLY.

234
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:45,548
HAVE YOU SEEN 
MY OTHER PAIR OF PANTS?

235
00:07:45,548 --> 00:07:47,424
- LUPE WASHED THEM, 
AND THEY SPROUTED.

236
00:07:47,424 --> 00:07:48,425
I THREW THEM OUT.

237
00:07:48,425 --> 00:07:50,928
- WELL, THAT PUTS A LOT 
OF PRESSURE ON THIS PAIR.

238
00:07:50,928 --> 00:07:51,571
- I THINK THIS ONE'S GOOD.

239
00:07:51,571 --> 00:07:54,098
LOOKS LIKE IT WOULD'VE 
PUT UP A FIGHT.

240
00:07:54,098 --> 00:07:55,516
- I PUT UP ONE TO GET IT.

241
00:07:55,516 --> 00:07:57,602
- HEY, AS LONG AS IT GETS 
FRANK WRENCH TO BID ON ME.

242
00:07:57,602 --> 00:07:59,144
- IT WON'T. 
- HEY, MOM.

243
00:07:59,144 --> 00:08:01,188
I NEED TO BORROW 
YOUR COUNTRY CLUB CARD.

244
00:08:01,188 --> 00:08:04,567
THERE'S A FRIEND I HAVE 
THAT HAS LUNCH THERE OFTEN

245
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:05,860
I'D LIKE TO RUN INTO.

246
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:07,820
- SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE ASKING 
FOR A FAVOR.

247
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:09,238
- AND I KNOW WHAT THAT'S GONNA 
COST ME.

248
00:08:09,238 --> 00:08:10,239
I'M WILLING TO BID ON YOU.

249
00:08:10,698 --> 00:08:11,699
- I'LL GIVE YOU THE MONEY.

250
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:13,325
START AT FIVE GRAND.

251
00:08:13,325 --> 00:08:16,120
IF THERE ARE OTHER BIDDERS, 
BACK OFF GRACEFULLY.

252
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:19,999
SHOUT OUT, "I GET HER 364 DAYS 
A YEAR FOR FREE!"

253
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:21,250
OR SOMETHING.

254
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:23,460
- YOU'RE NOT GONNA HEAR 
THAT PHRASE.

255
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:25,630
narrator: SOON, 
TOBIAS CAME ACROSS A FLYER

256
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:28,591
THAT PROMISED TO IMPROVE 
BOTH HIS MASCULINE SELF-IMAGE

257
00:08:28,591 --> 00:08:30,551
AND HIS FINANCIAL STANDING.

258
00:08:30,551 --> 00:08:32,177
- THEY'RE LITERALLY BLUE, 
NOT SAD.

259
00:08:32,177 --> 00:08:33,888
narrator: MEANWHILE, 
MICHAEL WENT TO HAVE

260
00:08:33,888 --> 00:08:36,265
HIS ACCIDENTAL ENCOUNTER 
WITH SALLY,

261
00:08:36,265 --> 00:08:40,603
BUT HAD FORGOTTEN ABOUT 
THE CLUB'S DRESS CODE FOR LUNCH.

262
00:08:40,603 --> 00:08:42,688
- I CAN'T WEAR THIS. 
I LOOK LIKE I'M 16.

263
00:08:42,688 --> 00:08:44,314
- MICHAEL? 
- OH, NO.

264
00:08:44,314 --> 00:08:46,526
- HELLO, MICHAEL. 
- STAN.

265
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:47,943
HELLO, SALLY. 
- HI.

266
00:08:47,943 --> 00:08:49,862
SO, ARE YOU MEETING SOMEONE 
HERE FOR LUNCH?

267
00:08:49,862 --> 00:08:51,405
NO, I WAS GOING TO, 
THEN THEY CANCELED.

268
00:08:51,405 --> 00:08:52,657
SO I'M GONNA TAKE OFF.

269
00:08:52,657 --> 00:08:55,075
- NO. 
JUST JOIN US, PLEASE.

270
00:08:55,075 --> 00:08:57,202
narrator: MICHAEL KNEW 
HE COULDN'T SAY NO,

271
00:08:57,202 --> 00:08:59,664
BUT HE ALSO KNEW HE COULDN'T 
FLIRT IN FRONT OF HER FATHER.

272
00:08:59,664 --> 00:09:01,165
- LET'S DO IT.

273
00:09:01,165 --> 00:09:02,667
narrator: AND AT ANOTHER TABLE,

274
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:04,501
GOB WAS BEING TAKEN OUT 
TO LUNCH.

275
00:09:04,501 --> 00:09:06,503
- READ ME 
THE APPETIZERS AGAIN.

276
00:09:06,503 --> 00:09:08,548
- FRIED CHEESE...

277
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:10,591
WITH CLUB SAUCE.

278
00:09:10,591 --> 00:09:11,759
- [moans]

279
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:15,971
- POPCORN SHRIMP 
WITH CLUB SAUCE.

280
00:09:15,971 --> 00:09:17,682
CHICKEN FINGERS...

281
00:09:17,682 --> 00:09:18,683
- OH, STOP IT.

282
00:09:18,683 --> 00:09:19,850
YOU'RE MAKING ME DIZZY.

283
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:22,519
- WITH SPICY CLUB SAUCE.

284
00:09:22,519 --> 00:09:24,814
- NO! 
I MEAN STOP IT.

285
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:27,524
- GOB? 
- MICHAEL.

286
00:09:27,524 --> 00:09:29,443
- WHY DON'T YOU JOIN US? 
- OH, NO.

287
00:09:29,443 --> 00:09:30,903
- I'M JUST HELPING HER EAT.

288
00:09:30,903 --> 00:09:33,280
- OH, IF YOU'D PREFER PRIVACY.

289
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,574
- WHAT? NO. 
ARE YOU KIDDING?

290
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:36,909
I DIDN'T EVEN WANNA HAVE LUNCH 
WITH HER IN THE FIRST PLACE.

291
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:39,244
I JUST--OR--I JU--

292
00:09:39,244 --> 00:09:41,371
[clears throat]

293
00:09:41,371 --> 00:09:43,040
narrator: AND SO LUNCH CONTINUED

294
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,250
WITH BOTH BLUTH BOYS 
TRYING TO PROVE

295
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:47,377
THEY WEREN'T INTERESTED 
IN THE WOMEN

296
00:09:47,377 --> 00:09:48,588
THEY WERE INTERESTED IN.

297
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:49,689
- YOU KNOW, WHEN I SAW THOSE 
GOLF CARTS,

298
00:09:49,689 --> 00:09:52,925
IT KIND OF BROUGHT BACK 
SOME MEMORIES.

299
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:55,552
- DID YOU HAVE TOO MUCH 
CLUB SAUCE ON YOUR CALAMARI?

300
00:09:55,552 --> 00:09:58,222
- GOB, READ ME THE DESSERTS.

301
00:09:58,222 --> 00:09:59,932
- SHE P-P--

302
00:09:59,932 --> 00:10:02,476
PROBABLY FORGOT 
HER OLD LADY GLASSES.

303
00:10:02,476 --> 00:10:04,478
- WHAT IS THE MATTER 
WITH YOU, GOBY?

304
00:10:04,478 --> 00:10:07,272
- I'M HAPPY TO READ 
TO THE LOVELY LADY.

305
00:10:07,272 --> 00:10:10,484
- "AN ASSORTMENT 
OF ICE CREAMS AND SORBETS."

306
00:10:10,484 --> 00:10:11,819
- YOU ALL RIGHT WITH HIM 
READING TO YOUR GIRL?

307
00:10:11,819 --> 00:10:13,195
- NOT MY GIRL. 
- HUH?

308
00:10:13,195 --> 00:10:14,989
- WHY DON'T YOU READ 
TO YOUR GIRL?

309
00:10:14,989 --> 00:10:16,741
- COME ON. 
I DON'T HAVE A GIRL.

310
00:10:16,741 --> 00:10:17,742
- NO, THANKS.

311
00:10:17,742 --> 00:10:19,409
ALREADY TAKEN CARE OF. 
THANK YOU. THANKS.

312
00:10:19,409 --> 00:10:20,410
- I'M SORRY.

313
00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:23,163
APPARENTLY THERE'S BEEN SOME 
INCREASED ACTIVITY ON YOUR CARD.

314
00:10:23,163 --> 00:10:25,207
[whispers] 
IT'S BEEN DECLINED.

315
00:10:25,207 --> 00:10:28,127
narrator: IN FACT, THE INCREASED 
ACTIVITY ON MICHAEL'S CARD

316
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:29,128
WAS HIS FATHER.

317
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:30,921
- DO YOU REALLY THINK THAT 
A HOT TUB IS THE BEST THING

318
00:10:30,921 --> 00:10:32,214
FOR SOMEONE WITH YOUR CONDITION?

319
00:10:32,214 --> 00:10:33,340
- I CAN'T SEE, BUT, UH...

320
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:36,510
I DIDN'T KNOW THERE WAS 
A DOCTOR INSTALLING THIS.

321
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:39,138
- SOMEBODY ORDER A CASE 
OF BAG-IN-BOIL FROZEN DINNERS?

322
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:40,222
- I'M HAPPY TO GET THIS.

323
00:10:40,222 --> 00:10:41,306
NO, NO. NO, PLEASE, STAN.

324
00:10:41,306 --> 00:10:43,142
I'LL DO IT, 
UM...

325
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:45,019
[whispers] CAN YOU PUT THIS 
ON MY MOTHER'S CARD?

326
00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:46,020
- YOUR MOTHER? 
NO.

327
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:47,938
NO, NO, NO. 
SHE IS A POOL MEMBER ONLY.

328
00:10:47,938 --> 00:10:50,565
AND YOU'LL EXCUSE ME 
IF MY TONE IS NOT POLITE,

329
00:10:50,565 --> 00:10:52,818
BUT THIS IS MORE POLITE 
THAN SHE HAS EVER TALKED TO ME.

330
00:10:52,818 --> 00:10:54,111
narrator: MICHAEL HAD A FEELING

331
00:10:54,111 --> 00:10:56,864
WHY HIS CREDIT CARD 
HAD BEEN REJECTED.

332
00:10:56,864 --> 00:10:57,865
- WHAT THE HELL DID YOU DO?

333
00:10:57,865 --> 00:11:00,325
- [weak howling]

334
00:11:00,325 --> 00:11:02,577
I OVERDID IT.

335
00:11:02,577 --> 00:11:05,080
OH, IT'S SO HOT.

336
00:11:11,754 --> 00:11:14,589
narrator: MICHAEL'S FATHER 
HAD JUST INSTALLED A HOT TUB

337
00:11:14,589 --> 00:11:15,590
IN THE ATTIC.

338
00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:16,591
- WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?

339
00:11:16,591 --> 00:11:18,677
- I TRIED TO DRINK 
SOME OF THE WATER,

340
00:11:18,677 --> 00:11:22,556
AND IT WAS TOO HOT, 
AND IT TASTED LIKE SOY SAUCE.

341
00:11:22,556 --> 00:11:25,184
I THINK 
THE TERIYAKI CHICKEN BURST.

342
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:27,394
- THAT'S WHY PEOPLE TYPICALLY 
DON'T COOK IN THESE THINGS

343
00:11:27,394 --> 00:11:28,478
OR INSTALL THEM IN ATTICS.

344
00:11:28,478 --> 00:11:30,189
- YOU GOT TO GET IT 
OUT OF HERE, MIKEY.

345
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:33,525
MY EYES, 
THEY'RE BURNING.

346
00:11:33,525 --> 00:11:35,360
- WANNA THANK YOU FOR 
CHARGING IT TO MY CREDIT CARD.

347
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,612
YOU MADE ME LOOK VERY FOOLISH 
IN FRONT OF SALLY SITWELL.

348
00:11:37,612 --> 00:11:39,949
- DID YOU STICK IT TO HER? 
- NO, I DIDN'T.

349
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:42,868
YOU SCREWED THAT UP, JUST LIKE 
YOU SCREWED UP THIS HOT TUB.

350
00:11:42,868 --> 00:11:44,829
IS THAT VEAL MARSALA 
STUCK IN THE INTAKE?

351
00:11:44,829 --> 00:11:47,706
- THEY ALL LOOK SO GOOD 
ON THE BOXES.

352
00:11:47,706 --> 00:11:50,167
YOU KNOW, IT'S GOOD 
YOU BACKED OFF SALLY.

353
00:11:50,167 --> 00:11:51,961
I DON'T NEED THAT GUY SAYING

354
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:55,130
HIS DAUGHTER'S STICKING IT 
TO MY LOSER SON.

355
00:11:55,130 --> 00:11:56,131
- YOU KNOW SOMETHING?

356
00:11:56,131 --> 00:11:58,175
THE REASON THAT I NEVER 
WENT AFTER HER

357
00:11:58,175 --> 00:12:00,469
IS BECAUSE 
YOU'RE ALWAYS PUSHING ME,

358
00:12:00,469 --> 00:12:02,763
BUT NOW THAT I KNOW 
THAT I DON'T HAVE YOUR APPROVAL,

359
00:12:02,763 --> 00:12:04,181
I-I THINK THAT, UH...

360
00:12:04,181 --> 00:12:07,142
I THINK THAT I'LL FINALLY 
GO FOR IT.

361
00:12:07,142 --> 00:12:12,147
- THIS ISN'T TURNING INTO 
THE PARTY HANGOUT I HOPED.

362
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:14,984
- HEY.

363
00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:16,777
- HEY, DAD, I THOUGHT I HEARD 
SOMETHING BEFORE,

364
00:12:16,777 --> 00:12:18,445
LIKE A WOLF DROWNING 
OR SOMETHING.

365
00:12:18,445 --> 00:12:20,614
- I THINK THAT THAT WAS 
MAYBE THE HOUSE SETTLING.

366
00:12:20,614 --> 00:12:22,407
SPEAKING OF SETTLING, HOW'S ANN?

367
00:12:22,407 --> 00:12:23,826
I MEAN, HAVE YOU--HAVE YOU 
SETTLED ON

368
00:12:23,826 --> 00:12:25,577
AN ARTIST'S WORK TO BURN?

369
00:12:25,577 --> 00:12:27,329
- WELL, I WAS THINKING EMINEM 
FOR A WHILE.

370
00:12:27,329 --> 00:12:28,330
- SURE.

371
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:30,207
- BUT, YOU KNOW, EVERYONE IS 
GONNA BE BURNING EMINEM.

372
00:12:30,207 --> 00:12:31,208
SO, YOU KNOW--

373
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:32,584
AND THEN I GOT THIS 
PAT BOONE ALBUM,

374
00:12:32,584 --> 00:12:34,586
BUT THE GUY IS CHRISTIAN.

375
00:12:34,586 --> 00:12:35,629
BUT, YOU KNOW, I DON'T KNOW.

376
00:12:35,629 --> 00:12:37,131
SOMEBODY'S GOT TO BURN, RIGHT?

377
00:12:37,131 --> 00:12:38,924
- WELL, I GUESS.

378
00:12:39,591 --> 00:12:42,094
- ALL RIGHT.

379
00:12:42,094 --> 00:12:43,095
- [sighs]

380
00:12:43,095 --> 00:12:44,388
- HEY.

381
00:12:44,388 --> 00:12:47,224
- OH, BOY, I GOT SOME LOOKS 
ON THE BUS 'CAUSE OF THIS.

382
00:12:47,224 --> 00:12:48,642
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING 
WITH THAT THING?

383
00:12:48,642 --> 00:12:50,895
- I AM GOING TO CATCH THAT WOLF, 
MICHAEL.

384
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:52,646
I'M GONNA SHOOT IT 
WITH THIS TRANQUILIZER GUN,

385
00:12:52,646 --> 00:12:53,688
GET THE REWARD,

386
00:12:53,688 --> 00:12:55,858
AND BID ON MY WOMAN 
AT THE CHARITY AUCTION.

387
00:12:55,858 --> 00:12:57,526
- ISN'T THERE SOME 
KIND OF A WAITING PERIOD

388
00:12:57,526 --> 00:12:58,527
FOR A RIFLE LIKE THAT?

389
00:12:58,527 --> 00:12:59,528
- [laughs]

390
00:12:59,528 --> 00:13:01,238
IT TURNS OUT THERE IS.

391
00:13:01,238 --> 00:13:02,882
- TWO WEEKS? 
ISN'T THERE A LOOPHOLE?

392
00:13:02,882 --> 00:13:06,618
- THERE IS A GUN SHOW LOOPHOLE.

393
00:13:06,618 --> 00:13:07,661
- AND WHAT TIMING, HUH?

394
00:13:07,661 --> 00:13:10,664
I MEAN, RIGHT OUT BACK 
THEY WERE HAVING ONE.

395
00:13:10,664 --> 00:13:13,667
GOB, I'M GOING HUNTING 
FOR MY WIFE.

396
00:13:13,667 --> 00:13:16,670
- HOW LAME WAS LUCILLE 2 
AT LUNCH, HUH?

397
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:18,005
- YOU'VE GOTTEN ATTACHED, 
HAVEN'T YOU?

398
00:13:18,005 --> 00:13:20,299
- YOU'RE NOT GONNA TELL ANYBODY 
ABOUT THIS, ARE YOU?

399
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:21,508
- COME ON. 
I'M NOT ONE TO JUDGE.

400
00:13:21,508 --> 00:13:23,093
EVERY TIME I'VE GONE OUT 
WITH SALLY,

401
00:13:23,093 --> 00:13:25,512
I'VE LOOKED LIKE 
I'M 12 YEARS OLD.

402
00:13:25,512 --> 00:13:28,307
BUT, YES, I PROBABLY WILL 
TELL PEOPLE ABOUT THIS.

403
00:13:28,307 --> 00:13:30,059
- MAYBE WE CAN STRIKE UP A DEAL.

404
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:32,978
YOU KEEP THIS TO YOURSELF, 
I HELP YOU GET SALLY.

405
00:13:32,978 --> 00:13:34,980
SIPHON A LITTLE 
SOMETHING FROM HER CAR,

406
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:37,524
YOU SHOW UP IN THE CORVETTE, 
LOOKING LIKE A MAN.

407
00:13:37,524 --> 00:13:39,651
CAR TROUBLES?

408
00:13:39,651 --> 00:13:41,111
- PROBABLY SHOULDN'T DO 
THE FIREBALL

409
00:13:41,111 --> 00:13:42,112
WHEN YOU SIPHON THE GAS.

410
00:13:42,112 --> 00:13:45,157
- I GUESS THIS FLINT'S STILL GOT 
A LITTLE LIFE LEFT IN IT, HUH?

411
00:13:45,157 --> 00:13:47,284
narrator: LINDSAY, MEANWHILE, 
WAS WAITING IN THE PARK

412
00:13:47,284 --> 00:13:49,369
FOR HER DATE WITH MOSES TAYLOR.

413
00:13:49,369 --> 00:13:50,537
- SORRY I'M LATE.

414
00:13:50,537 --> 00:13:52,664
FANS.

415
00:13:52,664 --> 00:13:55,167
SOMETIMES IT TAKES A WHILE 
TO JAR THEIR MEMORIES.

416
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:56,585
NICE FUR.

417
00:13:56,585 --> 00:13:58,045
YOU KNOW, THERE ARE SOME NUTS 
OUT THERE

418
00:13:58,045 --> 00:14:00,630
WHO'D WANNA THROW RED PAINT 
ALL OVER YOU.

419
00:14:00,630 --> 00:14:01,631
WAIT A MINUTE.

420
00:14:01,631 --> 00:14:03,675
I THINK THERE'S ONE 
RIGHT OVER THERE.

421
00:14:03,675 --> 00:14:05,260
- OH, MY GOD. YOU'RE--

422
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:07,387
- SOMEONE NEEDS TO READ THIS.

423
00:14:08,222 --> 00:14:10,849
narrator: AND THAT'S WHEN 
LINDSAY'S HEEL WENT OUT.

424
00:14:10,849 --> 00:14:11,850
[grunts]

425
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:12,851
[howls]

426
00:14:12,851 --> 00:14:14,478
[gunshot]

427
00:14:14,478 --> 00:14:16,521
- I GOT HIM.

428
00:14:16,521 --> 00:14:18,440
- FALSE ALARM.

429
00:14:19,524 --> 00:14:21,026
CRAP.

430
00:14:25,572 --> 00:14:27,824
- I'M BEING SAVED 
BY FRANK WRENCH.

431
00:14:27,824 --> 00:14:28,993
- NO, YOU'RE NOT.

432
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:30,535
- FRANK WRENCH. 
- SHUT UP.

433
00:14:30,535 --> 00:14:34,248
narrator: BUT, UNBEKNOWNST 
TO LINDSAY AND TOBIAS,

434
00:14:34,248 --> 00:14:37,501
THE ACTOR WHO PLAYED 
FRANK WRENCH WASN'T SAVING HER,

435
00:14:37,501 --> 00:14:39,628
BUT WAS JUST TRYING 
TO DISTANCE HIMSELF

436
00:14:39,628 --> 00:14:43,715
FROM THE OUTLANDISH "MOSES 
TAYLOR HUNTS PEOPLE" SCANDAL

437
00:14:43,715 --> 00:14:46,927
THAT HAD BEEN STARTED 
BY A RABID ANTI-GUN FANATIC.

438
00:14:51,515 --> 00:14:54,351
narrator: AND THAT NIGHT, 
MICHAEL WENT TO HELP SALLY

439
00:14:54,351 --> 00:14:56,853
WITH THE CAR PROBLEMS 
GOB HAD CREATED.

440
00:14:56,853 --> 00:14:59,731
- THE HELL?

441
00:14:59,731 --> 00:15:00,732
narrator: ONLY TO FIND OUT

442
00:15:00,732 --> 00:15:02,943
THINGS HAD GOTTEN 
OUT OF HAND FOR GOB.

443
00:15:02,943 --> 00:15:06,446
MICHAEL DID LOOK HEROIC 
AS HE WENT TO PUT OUT THE FIRE.

444
00:15:06,446 --> 00:15:10,117
UNFORTUNATELY, SALLY ARRIVED 
TOO LATE TO SEE HIM THAT WAY.

445
00:15:10,117 --> 00:15:11,701
- GOD, WHAT HAPPENED?

446
00:15:11,701 --> 00:15:12,827
- CAR TROUBLE?

447
00:15:12,827 --> 00:15:14,704
[coughing]

448
00:15:21,003 --> 00:15:23,005
narrator: GOB HAD JUST 
BLOWN UP A CAR.

449
00:15:23,005 --> 00:15:25,424
THE NEXT THING I KNOW, 
I'M RUNNING FOR MY LIFE.

450
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:26,800
AND ALL I COULD THINK WAS,

451
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,261
IF SOMETHING WERE TO 
EVER HAPPEN TO ME,

452
00:15:29,261 --> 00:15:31,263
HOW SAD I'D BE, YOU KNOW?

453
00:15:31,263 --> 00:15:33,223
- WHAT YOU DID TO ME 
AT LUNCH TODAY,

454
00:15:33,223 --> 00:15:36,101
YOU WERE ASHAMED TO BE 
WITH ME.

455
00:15:36,101 --> 00:15:38,562
- NO! I WAS ASHAMED TO BE 
SEEN WITH YOU.

456
00:15:38,562 --> 00:15:39,939
I LIKE BEING WITH YOU.

457
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:43,483
- I'M SORRY, 
BUT YOU HAVE NO COURAGE.

458
00:15:43,483 --> 00:15:46,528
- HOW CAN YOU SAY THAT? 
SHH.

459
00:15:46,528 --> 00:15:48,113
I THOUGHT I HEARD MY MOM.

460
00:15:48,113 --> 00:15:50,532
[whispers] 
HOW CAN YOU SAY THAT?

461
00:15:50,532 --> 00:15:52,909
narrator: AND ON THE OTHER SIDE 
OF THE WALL,

462
00:15:52,909 --> 00:15:55,495
LUCILLE WAS FINALIZING 
HER PLANS FOR THE EVENING.

463
00:15:55,495 --> 00:15:57,456
- YOU CAN BID UP TO $10,000.

464
00:15:57,456 --> 00:15:58,457
- THE DEAL IS OFF.

465
00:15:58,457 --> 00:16:00,584
YOU DIDN'T TELL ME IT WAS 
A RESTRICTED MEMBERSHIP.

466
00:16:00,584 --> 00:16:02,127
FIND SOMEBODY ELSE 
TO DO YOUR BIDDING.

467
00:16:02,127 --> 00:16:03,337
- THERE IS NO ONE ELSE.

468
00:16:03,337 --> 00:16:05,672
[coughing]

469
00:16:05,672 --> 00:16:06,673
- HI. 
- HI.

470
00:16:06,673 --> 00:16:08,383
THEY SAID I COULD 
SEE YOU FINALLY.

471
00:16:08,383 --> 00:16:09,426
- YES.

472
00:16:09,426 --> 00:16:12,887
- GOD, I JUST FEEL AWFUL 
FOR WHOEVER'S CAR THAT WAS.

473
00:16:12,887 --> 00:16:15,057
- MM-HMM. 
I KNOW IT.

474
00:16:15,057 --> 00:16:16,058
[coughs]

475
00:16:16,058 --> 00:16:18,352
SALLY, I WAS THINKING 
THAT MAYBE YOU AND I COULD--

476
00:16:18,935 --> 00:16:20,395
[coughing]

477
00:16:20,395 --> 00:16:22,272
DON'T TRY TO TALK. 
I HAVE TO RUN ANYWAY.

478
00:16:22,272 --> 00:16:24,691
I GOT TO DO THIS 
CHARITY AUCTION THING.

479
00:16:24,691 --> 00:16:25,734
I'M SORRY, SIR.

480
00:16:25,734 --> 00:16:27,819
YOUR BLUE CROSS BLUE SHIELD 
WAS DENIED.

481
00:16:27,819 --> 00:16:29,989
WE'VE CALLED YOUR MOTHER.

482
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:32,116
[coughing]

483
00:16:32,116 --> 00:16:33,658
- I'LL BE BACK. 
I'LL CHECK ON YOU LATER.

484
00:16:33,658 --> 00:16:37,246
FEEL BETTER.

485
00:16:37,246 --> 00:16:39,414
GO OUT SOMETIME.

486
00:16:39,414 --> 00:16:40,415
[grunts]

487
00:16:40,415 --> 00:16:42,876
narrator: MICHAEL DECIDED 
TO BID ON HER AT THE AUCTION,

488
00:16:42,876 --> 00:16:45,462
AND HE KNEW JUST WHERE HE COULD 
GET THE MONEY TO DO SO.

489
00:16:45,462 --> 00:16:47,256
- YEAH. 
START DRAINING THE HOT TUB.

490
00:16:47,256 --> 00:16:48,798
IT'S GOING BACK.

491
00:16:48,798 --> 00:16:51,426
narrator: AND LUCILLE, 
WITH NO OTHER PROSPECTS,

492
00:16:51,426 --> 00:16:54,221
TURNED TO THE SON SHE LEAST 
EXPECTED TO SUPPORT HER.

493
00:16:54,221 --> 00:16:56,973
GOB, I DON'T SUPPOSE 
I COULD PAY YOU

494
00:16:56,973 --> 00:16:59,351
TO BID ON ME 
AT A CHARITY AUCTION.

495
00:16:59,351 --> 00:17:02,062
narrator: AND GOB WAS JUST 
DEPRESSED ENOUGH TO DO SO.

496
00:17:02,062 --> 00:17:04,689
- WHATEVER YOU WANT. 
- OH, GOODY.

497
00:17:04,689 --> 00:17:06,775
narrator: AND FINALLY, 
GEORGE MICHAEL AND ANN'S

498
00:17:06,775 --> 00:17:10,237
CHRISTIAN MUSIC BONFIRE 
WAS UNDER WAY.

499
00:17:10,237 --> 00:17:11,613
- WITHOUT EVER GOING TO THE GYM.

500
00:17:11,613 --> 00:17:13,698
- I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW MANY 
PEOPLE YOU TOLD ABOUT THIS.

501
00:17:13,698 --> 00:17:15,159
- YEAH, I HOPE I DIDN'T 
CONFUSE PEOPLE

502
00:17:15,159 --> 00:17:16,868
BY SAYING IT WAS 
A CD BURNING PARTY.

503
00:17:16,868 --> 00:17:19,079
- GREAT PARTY!

504
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:23,042
MAEBY, I BURNED LIKE 10 CD's 
FROM SOMEBODY'S MP3 PLAYER.

505
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:24,543
- THIS IS A DISASTER.

506
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:26,378
- YOU KNOW, MAYBE YOU SHOULD 
JUST TRY LISTENING

507
00:17:26,378 --> 00:17:27,546
TO SOME OF THE MUSIC.

508
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:29,298
- YEAH, SOME OF THE ARTISTS 
ARE KIND OF TALENTED.

509
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:30,632
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'VE HEARD OF 
THE JERKY BOYS.

510
00:17:30,632 --> 00:17:32,759
THEY DO, LIKE, 
THESE PRANK PHONE CALLS.

511
00:17:32,759 --> 00:17:33,760
IT'S KIND OF OLD SCHOOL,

512
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,387
BUT I HAVE THE TAPE IN MY ROOM.

513
00:17:37,181 --> 00:17:40,850
I ACCIDENTALLY 
DIDN'T BURN IT YET.

514
00:17:40,850 --> 00:17:42,519
narrator: 
MEANWHILE, THE AUCTION BEGAN.

515
00:17:42,519 --> 00:17:46,440
- NEXT UP, WE'VE GOT LAST YEAR'S 
CHARITY CASE, LINDSAY FUNKE.

516
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,816
- narrator: LINDSAY SHOWED UP.

517
00:17:47,816 --> 00:17:48,817
- OH, NO. 
NOT AGAIN.

518
00:17:48,817 --> 00:17:50,944
narrator: ALTHOUGH SHE WAS 
STILL FEELING THE EFFECTS

519
00:17:50,944 --> 00:17:51,945
OF THE TRANQUILIZER.

520
00:17:51,945 --> 00:17:52,946
- HUNDRED DOLLARS, FOLKS?

521
00:17:52,946 --> 00:17:55,157
- STICK A WRENCH IN ME. 
I'M DONE.

522
00:17:55,157 --> 00:17:57,326
- ANYBODY GOT 50? 
- MY WIFE IS HUMILIATED.

523
00:17:57,326 --> 00:18:00,954
THIS IS MY CHANCE TO RIGHT 
THE SMALL WRONG THAT I DID.

524
00:18:00,954 --> 00:18:01,955
- YOU SHOT HER IN THE ASS

525
00:18:01,955 --> 00:18:04,749
WITH ABOUT FOUR OUNCES 
OF HORSE TRANQUILIZER.

526
00:18:04,749 --> 00:18:06,210
- I HAVEN'T BEEN 
THE PERFECT HUSBAND.

527
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:07,794
YES, I ADMIT THAT.

528
00:18:07,794 --> 00:18:09,713
BUT NOW IS MY CHANCE 
TO BE A HERO.

529
00:18:09,713 --> 00:18:12,632
PLEASE, MICHAEL, 
GIVE ME SOME OF YOUR MONEY.

530
00:18:12,632 --> 00:18:13,842
- DOES ANYBODY HAVE 10?

531
00:18:13,842 --> 00:18:16,178
- I'VE GOT $5,000, 
AND I NEED THAT FOR SALLY,

532
00:18:16,178 --> 00:18:17,512
BUT IF YOU WANT TO MAKE 
A LOW BID--

533
00:18:17,512 --> 00:18:19,098
- $5,000.

534
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:20,807
- FOR THAT? 
SOLD.

535
00:18:20,807 --> 00:18:22,559
- [groans]

536
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:24,186
I THINK YOU OVERPAID.

537
00:18:24,186 --> 00:18:27,106
narrator: GEORGE MICHAEL'S 
PROSPECTS WERE ALSO IMPROVING

538
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:29,065
AS THE TWO MADE 
PRANK PHONE CALLS TOGETHER.

539
00:18:29,065 --> 00:18:30,775
- LET ME TRY.

540
00:18:30,775 --> 00:18:32,694
HEY, RUBBERNECK.

541
00:18:32,694 --> 00:18:34,154
- ANN, COULD YOU 
AND GEORGE MICHAEL

542
00:18:34,154 --> 00:18:36,615
PLEASE CALL SOMEONE ELSE 
FOR A LITTLE WHILE?

543
00:18:36,615 --> 00:18:38,283
- HE KNOWS IT WAS US. 
- WHAT?

544
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:47,209
- WE FINALLY GOT 
A GOOD ONE COMIN' UP.

545
00:18:47,209 --> 00:18:49,794
SALLY SITWELL.

546
00:18:49,794 --> 00:18:50,795
WHAT DO I HEAR?

547
00:18:50,795 --> 00:18:52,256
- $500.

548
00:18:52,256 --> 00:18:55,008
- YOU'RE NOT BIDDING? 
I WAS HOPING YOU WOULD.

549
00:18:55,008 --> 00:18:56,176
- YOU WERE?

550
00:18:56,176 --> 00:18:57,969
- YOU'RE A GOOD KID. 
YOU ALWAYS HAVE BEEN.

551
00:18:57,969 --> 00:18:59,721
NOT LIKE THAT SHOWBOAT 
OF A FATHER OF YOURS,

552
00:18:59,721 --> 00:19:01,806
IF YOU DON'T MIND ME SAYING.

553
00:19:01,806 --> 00:19:03,600
- I'VE CALLED HIM SO MUCH WORSE.

554
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,770
THE TRUTH IS, SIR, 
I AM INTERESTED,

555
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:08,855
BUT I DON'T HAVE THE MONEY 
TO BUY YOUR DAUGHTER.

556
00:19:08,855 --> 00:19:10,274
- [chuckles]

557
00:19:10,274 --> 00:19:12,484
WELL, YOU SURE DO DRIVE 
A NICE CAR,

558
00:19:12,484 --> 00:19:13,818
AND I NEED ONE.

559
00:19:13,818 --> 00:19:16,446
MINE GOT TORCHED TODAY.

560
00:19:16,446 --> 00:19:18,948
- DROP IT OFF WHEN YOU 
DROP MY DAUGHTER OFF TONIGHT.

561
00:19:18,948 --> 00:19:22,577
narrator: AND FINALLY, WITH BOTH 
THE APPROVAL OF SALLY'S FATHER

562
00:19:22,577 --> 00:19:24,996
AND THE LACK OF APPROVAL 
OF HIS OWN,

563
00:19:24,996 --> 00:19:26,998
MICHAEL WAS READY 
TO MAKE HIS MOVE.

564
00:19:27,624 --> 00:19:29,042
- $15,000.

565
00:19:29,042 --> 00:19:30,877
- WHAT?

566
00:19:30,877 --> 00:19:32,128
- WOW. 
- YEAH.

567
00:19:32,128 --> 00:19:33,380
- I GOT TO TELL YOU,

568
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:35,257
THIS PUTS A LOT OF PRESSURE 
ON ME.

569
00:19:35,257 --> 00:19:36,591
- IT'S FOR A GOOD CAUSE.

570
00:19:36,591 --> 00:19:38,677
- I HEARD IT WAS 
TO RESEED THE GREENS.

571
00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:41,971
GONNA BE A LOT OF SHIFTS FOR YOU 
AT THE BANANA STAND, HUH?

572
00:19:41,971 --> 00:19:43,097
- I SHOULD BE HONEST WITH YOU.

573
00:19:43,097 --> 00:19:44,474
I DON'T HAVE THAT MUCH MONEY,

574
00:19:44,474 --> 00:19:46,685
AND I SOLD THE CORVETTE 
TO COVER IT.

575
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:48,353
- THAT WAS QUICK. 
TO WHO?

576
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:49,688
- YOUR FATHER, 
AS A MATTER OF FACT.

577
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:51,690
- MY FATHER? 
- YEAH.

578
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:53,817
- MY FATHER CAN'T DRIVE 
A CONVERTIBLE.

579
00:19:53,817 --> 00:19:55,194
- MIND IF I OPEN IT UP?

580
00:19:58,738 --> 00:20:00,073
WOW!

581
00:20:00,073 --> 00:20:01,408
GOT SOME PICKUP.

582
00:20:01,408 --> 00:20:02,909
- THIS IS JUST LIKE HIM.

583
00:20:02,909 --> 00:20:05,204
HE ALWAYS INTERFERES 
WITH EVERYONE I DATE.

584
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:08,498
WELL, YOU CAN TELL HIM 
TO GIVE YOU YOUR CAR BACK.

585
00:20:08,498 --> 00:20:10,792
- BUT I BOUGHT YOU.

586
00:20:10,792 --> 00:20:12,586
- I'M SORRY. 
I'M NOT LIKE YOU.

587
00:20:12,586 --> 00:20:17,299
I'D ALMOST RATHER DATE SOMEONE 
MY FATHER DOESN'T APPROVE OF.

588
00:20:17,299 --> 00:20:18,925
THANKS ANYWAY.

589
00:20:23,054 --> 00:20:25,098

THAT IS LIKE ME.

590
00:20:25,098 --> 00:20:26,475
THAT'S EXACTLY LIKE ME!

591
00:20:26,475 --> 00:20:29,769
narrator: AND SOON IT WAS TIME 
FOR GOB TO BID ON HIS MOTHER.

592
00:20:29,769 --> 00:20:31,187
