MICHAEL BLUTH WAS TRYING TO SAVE 
THE BLUTH COMPANY,

13
00:00:36,452 --> 00:00:38,246
BUT HIS FATHER 
WAS MAKING IT DIFFICULT.

14
00:00:38,246 --> 00:00:40,331
- I NEED THE FLIGHT RECORDS, 
DAD.

15
00:00:40,331 --> 00:00:42,708
I'M TRYING TO FIND SOME MONEY 
FOR THE FAMILY.

16
00:00:42,708 --> 00:00:44,169
- THERE'S ALWAYS MONEY 
IN THE BANANA STAND.

17
00:00:44,169 --> 00:00:47,338
I AM HAVING A LOVE AFFAIR 
WITH THIS ICE CREAM SANDWICH.

18
00:00:47,338 --> 00:00:48,798
YOU WANT SOME? 
YOU WANNA TAKE A BITE?

19
00:00:48,798 --> 00:00:49,799
- PLEASE, PLEASE. 
- COME ON, TAKE A BITE.

20
00:00:49,799 --> 00:00:51,801
- THE S.E.C. 
HAS LOCKED UP OUR FUNDS.

21
00:00:51,801 --> 00:00:53,136
THESE GUYS 
AREN'T MESSING AROUND.

22
00:00:53,136 --> 00:00:55,155
- NO TOUCHING.

23
00:00:55,155 --> 00:00:57,057
- SO I NEED YOU TO TELL ME,

24
00:00:57,057 --> 00:00:58,849
WERE YOU TAKING VACATIONS 
IN THE JET?

25
00:00:58,849 --> 00:01:00,185
IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE HIDING 
FROM ME?

26
00:01:00,185 --> 00:01:02,603
- [scoffs] I HAVEN'T HAD 
A VACATION IN YEARS.

27
00:01:02,603 --> 00:01:04,772
THIS IS MY VACATION.

28
00:01:04,772 --> 00:01:06,149
I'M EXERCISING.

29
00:01:06,149 --> 00:01:07,233
I'M SLEEPING WELL.

30
00:01:07,233 --> 00:01:08,818

31
00:01:08,818 --> 00:01:11,171

32
00:01:11,171 --> 00:01:13,114
- WHAT'S UP, PUMPKIN?

33
00:01:13,114 --> 00:01:15,366
- HEY, T-BONE.

34
00:01:15,366 --> 00:01:17,368
YEAH, 
T-BONE'S MY ROOMMATE.

35
00:01:17,368 --> 00:01:20,705

38
00:01:22,998 --> 00:01:25,960
- WELL, I GUESS EVERY VACATION'S 
GOTTA COME TO AN END.

39
00:01:29,964 --> 00:01:32,425
- YOU JUST MADE A FOOL OUT OF 
YOURSELF IN FRONT OF T-BONE.

40
00:01:32,425 --> 00:01:36,304
ANYWAY, I WANT YOU TO GIVE HIM 
A JOB AT THE COMPANY: SALES.

41
00:01:36,304 --> 00:01:37,597
- I'M NOT GONNA DO THAT. 
- WHY NOT?

42
00:01:37,597 --> 00:01:38,723
- WELL, BECAUSE... 
- BECAUSE HE'S A FLAMER?

43
00:01:38,723 --> 00:01:39,890
- WE DON'T HAVE ANY MONEY.

44
00:01:39,890 --> 00:01:41,058
- BECAUSE I TOLD YOU THAT 
IN CONFIDENCE.

45
00:01:41,058 --> 00:01:42,059
- YOU DON'T SEEM TO UNDERSTAND

46
00:01:42,059 --> 00:01:44,019
THAT I'M RUNNING 
THIS COMPANY NOW, DAD,

47
00:01:44,019 --> 00:01:46,772
AND I NEED THE FLIGHT RECORDS, 
AND I'M GONNA GET THEM

48
00:01:46,772 --> 00:01:48,358
WITH OR WITHOUT YOUR HELP.

49
00:01:48,358 --> 00:01:52,820
- ALL RIGHT. 
- NO TOUCHING.

50
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:54,405
- I GOT SOMETHING WE CAN TRY, 
ALL RIGHT?

51
00:01:54,405 --> 00:01:55,656
IT'S A LITTLE RISKY.

52
00:01:55,656 --> 00:01:57,032
- PLEASE.

53
00:01:57,032 --> 00:01:58,075

54
00:01:58,075 --> 00:02:01,871

TIME ADJUSTING TO HIS NEW ONE.

57
00:02:08,503 --> 00:02:10,338

GET UP. GET UP.

58
00:02:10,338 --> 00:02:11,922

59
00:02:11,922 --> 00:02:14,509
- OKAY, WE ARE JUST ABOUT 
ASS TO ANKLES BACK HERE, MAEBY.

60
00:02:14,509 --> 00:02:19,054
DO YOU WANNA HOP ON YOUR 
COUSIN'S LAP THERE, PLEASE?

61
00:02:19,054 --> 00:02:22,392

HIS PROBLEM HEAD-ON.

65
00:02:30,316 --> 00:02:32,360

AT THE BANANA STAND.

66
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,069
- WOW.

67
00:02:34,069 --> 00:02:36,239
HUH, WELL, THAT'S GREAT.

68
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:39,116
YOU KNOW, I USED TO BE 
JUST LIKE YOU WHEN I WAS A KID.

69
00:02:39,116 --> 00:02:40,368
I USED TO LOVE IT THERE.

70
00:02:40,368 --> 00:02:45,498
- [GEORGE] IT'S GONNA BE OUR 
BEST SUMMER EVER, MIKEY.

71
00:02:45,498 --> 00:02:47,041
- WELL, I'LL TELL YOU WHAT.

72
00:02:47,041 --> 00:02:50,295
I'M GONNA GIVE YOU A PROMOTION. 
WELCOME ABOARD, MR. MANAGER.

73
00:02:50,295 --> 00:02:52,505
- WOW, I'M MR. MANAGER.

74
00:02:52,505 --> 00:02:54,674
- WELL, MANAGER. 
WE JUST SAY "MANAGER."

75
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:57,927
AND YOU CAN HIRE AN EMPLOYEE 
IF YOU NEED ONE.

76
00:02:57,927 --> 00:02:59,220
- DO YOU THINK I NEED ONE?

77
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:01,180
- DON'T LOOK AT ME, 
MR. MANAGER.

78
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:03,349
- RIGHT. 
IT'S UP TO ME NOW.

79
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:04,892
I'M MR. MANAGER.

80
00:03:04,892 --> 00:03:06,727

WE JUST SAY...

81
00:03:06,727 --> 00:03:09,021
-I KNOW, BUT YOU JUST-- 
- IT DOESN'T MATTER WHO.

82
00:03:16,737 --> 00:03:19,240
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I EXPECTED.

83
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,991
WHAT'S GOING ON?

84
00:03:20,991 --> 00:03:22,243
THIS IS EXACTLY 
WHERE THE TWO OF YOU WERE

85
00:03:22,243 --> 00:03:23,828
WHEN I LEFT THIS MORNING.

86
00:03:23,828 --> 00:03:25,705
- IS NOBODY GONNA EVEN TRY 
TO GET A JOB?

87
00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:27,707
- I HAVE A JOB, MICHAEL. 
- YEAH?

88
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:29,292
- IT'S CALLED 
SUPPORTING MY HUSBAND.

89
00:03:29,292 --> 00:03:31,586
- WELL, YOU CERTAINLY 
HAVEN'T BEEN SHOPPING.

90
00:03:31,586 --> 00:03:32,753
THE ONLY THING I FOUND 
IN THE FREEZER

91
00:03:32,753 --> 00:03:34,714
WAS A DEAD DOVE IN A BAG.

92
00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:36,173
- YOU DIDN'T EAT THAT, 
DID YOU?

93
00:03:36,173 --> 00:03:38,593
'CAUSE I'VE ONLY GOT A COUPLE 
DAYS LEFT TO RETURN IT.

94
00:03:38,593 --> 00:03:41,804
DIED RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE 
OF A SHOW.

95
00:03:41,804 --> 00:03:43,223
- DO YOU WANT A CAGE FOR THAT?

96
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:45,225
- NO. 
I'M A MAGICIAN.

97
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:47,893
[dove cooing]

98
00:03:47,893 --> 00:03:49,937
[bells jingles]

99
00:03:49,937 --> 00:03:51,231
[cooing stops]

100
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:54,234
WHAT IS YOUR RETURN POLICY, 
BY THE WAY?

101
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:55,818
- NOT THAT I HAVE TO 
DEFEND MYSELF,

102
00:03:55,818 --> 00:03:57,653
BUT FOR YOUR INFORMATION, 
I DID GO SHOPPING.

103
00:03:57,653 --> 00:04:00,448
- YOU SPENT $68 
ON HAIR CONDITIONER?

104
00:04:00,448 --> 00:04:03,158
- A SMALL PRICE TO PAY 
FOR SELF-ESTEEM, MICHAEL.

105
00:04:03,158 --> 00:04:05,745
OR ARE YOU STILL JEALOUS 
THAT YOU LOST "BEST HAIR" TO ME

106
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:07,497
IN HIGH SCHOOL AND GOT DORKIEST?

107
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:09,582
- narrator: LINDSAY'S 
ACHIEVEMENTS IN HIGH SCHOOL

108
00:04:09,582 --> 00:04:13,294
HAD ALWAYS OVERSHADOWED 
MICHAEL'S.

109
00:04:13,294 --> 00:04:14,504
- I AGREE WITH MICHAEL.

110
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:16,381
IT'S IMPORTANT NOT TO TIE 
YOUR SELF-ESTEEM

111
00:04:16,381 --> 00:04:18,841
INTO HOW YOU LOOK 
OR WHAT PEOPLE THINK OF YOU.

112
00:04:18,841 --> 00:04:21,218
I MEAN, LOOK AT ME. 
I'M AN ACTOR,

113
00:04:21,218 --> 00:04:23,304
AN ACTOR FOR CRYING OUT LOUD.

114
00:04:23,304 --> 00:04:27,850
I MEAN, YOU KNOW HOW MUCH 
REJECTION I FACE EVERY DAY?

115
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:30,395
BUT IN THIS BUSINESS OF SHOW,

116
00:04:30,395 --> 00:04:32,938
YOU HAVE TO HAVE THE HEART 
OF AN ANGEL

117
00:04:32,938 --> 00:04:36,276
AND THE HIDE OF AN ELEPHANT.

118
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:38,361
- BUT YOU'VE NEVER ACTUALLY HAD 
AN AUDITION.

119
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:42,282
- [chuckles] 
WELL...

120
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:46,160
[imitating Steve Martin] 
EXCUSE ME.

121
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:51,707
EXCUSE ME.

122
00:04:51,707 --> 00:04:53,418
- SOME REALLY GREAT 
SPOUSAL SUPPORT.

123
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:54,835
YOU KNOW SOMETHING, LINDSAY?

124
00:04:54,835 --> 00:04:56,421
YOU MIGHT WANNA START THINKING 
ABOUT THE EXAMPLE

125
00:04:56,421 --> 00:04:57,672
YOU'RE SETTING 
FOR YOUR DAUGHTER,

126
00:04:57,672 --> 00:04:59,965
UNLESS YOU WANT HER TO END UP 
JUST LIKE YOU.

127
00:04:59,965 --> 00:05:02,468
- YEAH, 
SHOOT ME WHEN THAT HAPPENS.

128
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:05,846
- IS THERE A CARBON MONOXIDE 
LEAK IN THIS HOUSE?

129
00:05:08,182 --> 00:05:11,143
GEORGE MICHAEL, YOU'RE TAKING 
YOUR COUSIN TO WORK TODAY.

130
00:05:11,143 --> 00:05:12,312
THAT'S YOUR NEW EMPLOYEE.

131
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:13,688
I DO NOT WANT MY NIECE TO END UP

132
00:05:13,688 --> 00:05:14,814
JUST LIKE EVERYONE 
IN THIS FAMILY.

133
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:16,441
- UH-UH, YOU'RE NOT TELLING 
MY DAUGHTER WHAT TO DO.

134
00:05:16,441 --> 00:05:17,650
SHE'S A CHILD.

135
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:19,068
- NO, I'M NOT.

136
00:05:19,068 --> 00:05:20,861
I CAN WORK.

137
00:05:20,861 --> 00:05:22,029
- I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THIS.

138
00:05:22,029 --> 00:05:24,699
I MEAN, IT CAN GET PRETTY HAIRY 
IN THERE, AND--

139
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:26,617
- FINE. 
DO WHAT YOU WANT.

140
00:05:26,617 --> 00:05:29,745
IF I KNOW MY DAUGHTER, THAT 
STAND WON'T BE THERE IN A WEEK.

141
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:33,958
- YOU STAY ON TOP OF HER, BUDDY.

142
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:38,087
DO NOT BE AFRAID TO RIDE HER... 
HARD.

143

YOU'RE VIOLATING RIGHT NOW.

147
00:05:56,063 --> 00:05:58,107
- I CAN'T BELIEVE I VOLUNTEERED 
FOR THIS.

148
00:05:58,107 --> 00:06:01,569
THIS IS MY STUPIDEST 
REBELLION EVER.

THIS IS THE CASH DRAWER.

152
00:06:08,117 --> 00:06:09,619
MY DAD'S GONNA COME BY 
AT THE END OF THE WEEKEND,

153
00:06:09,619 --> 00:06:11,120
AND THE NUMBER OF BANANAS 
HAS TO MATCH

154
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,121
THE AMOUNT OF MONEY IN HERE.

155

SO IT ALL HAS TO EVEN OUT?

FOR THE FLIGHT RECORDS 
HIS FATHER WOULDN'T GIVE HIM.

161

AN ICE CREAM SANDWICH?

162
00:06:32,182 --> 00:06:33,518

163

- WHO WAS THAT? 
WAS THAT DAD?

164
00:06:34,852 --> 00:06:36,353
- THAT WAS GOB.

165
00:06:36,353 --> 00:06:37,855

166
00:06:37,855 --> 00:06:39,231
SO, MOM, I'M TRYING TO FIND...

167
00:06:39,231 --> 00:06:40,441

169
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:45,237
YOU KNOW, IT'S REALLY MORE 
BELIEVABLE IF YOU LET ME FINISH.

170
00:06:45,237 --> 00:06:46,489
WHY AM I THE ONLY ONE 
THAT SEEMS TO GET

171
00:06:46,489 --> 00:06:48,491
HOW MUCH TROUBLE 
THIS FAMILY IS IN?

172
00:06:48,491 --> 00:06:49,825
- OH, I GET IT, MICHAEL.

173
00:06:49,825 --> 00:06:51,410
I GET IT.

174
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:52,912
BUT HOW SHOULD I KNOW 
WHERE THE RECORDS ARE KEPT?

175
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:54,622
YOUR FATHER'S IN CHARGE 
OF ALL THAT.

176
00:06:54,622 --> 00:06:56,624
- NO, I'M IN CHARGE 
OF ALL OF THAT.

177
00:06:56,624 --> 00:06:58,668
AND I THINK THAT YOU DO KNOW 
WHERE THEY ARE.

178
00:06:58,668 --> 00:07:01,629
- OH, IT'S PROBABLY ALL 
IN A STORAGE UNIT SOMEWHERE.

179
00:07:01,629 --> 00:07:03,380
- WHERE IS THE STORAGE UNIT?

180
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:05,591
- I DON'T REMEMBER. 
- TRY.

181
00:07:05,591 --> 00:07:07,552
- SOMETHING WITH "DALE."

182
00:07:07,552 --> 00:07:09,554
I DON'T KNOW, BROOKFEATHER. 
RAINTREE.

183
00:07:09,554 --> 00:07:11,972
IT'S HOT. 
IT'S VERY HOT THERE.

184
00:07:11,972 --> 00:07:13,390
I'VE NEVER BEEN. 
GET A WARRANT.

185
00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:15,935
- DON'T THINK I WON'T.

186
00:07:15,935 --> 00:07:18,604
MOTHER,  MOTHER, 
I CARE ABOUT THIS FAMILY.

187
00:07:18,604 --> 00:07:21,441
- AND I DO TOO, MY DARLING.

188
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:23,233
THAT'S WHY I'M WORRIED 
ABOUT GOB.

189
00:07:23,233 --> 00:07:24,694
I WAS ON THE PHONE WITH HIM 
THIS MORNING.

190
00:07:24,694 --> 00:07:28,614
- YOU MEAN, JUST NOW, RIGHT, 
WHEN I CAME IN?

191
00:07:28,614 --> 00:07:30,491
- YES, JUST NOW, 
WHEN YOU CAME IN.

192
00:07:30,491 --> 00:07:31,909
AND HE'S UPSET.

193
00:07:31,909 --> 00:07:33,035
HE'S VERY UPSET.

194
00:07:33,035 --> 00:07:35,663
- YOU HAVEN'T INCLUDED HIM 
IN THE BUSINESS AT ALL.

195
00:07:35,663 --> 00:07:36,914
- HE'S YOUR OLDER BROTHER.

196
00:07:36,914 --> 00:07:38,666
YOU COULD FIND A LITTLE JOB 
FOR HIM.

197
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:40,042
MAKE HIM FEEL SPECIAL.

198
00:07:40,042 --> 00:07:42,294
- BUT HE'S NOT SPECIAL, MOTHER.

199
00:07:42,294 --> 00:07:44,630
- NO.

200
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:46,507
BUT HE LOVES YOU.

201
00:07:46,507 --> 00:07:48,342
WE ALL LOVE YOU.

202
00:07:48,342 --> 00:07:49,802
- WHERE'S THE STORAGE UNIT?

203
00:07:49,802 --> 00:07:51,471
- IT'S WITH YOUR WARRANT.

204
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:52,888
- [chuckling]

205
00:07:52,888 --> 00:07:57,392
LUZ, THAT COAT COST MORE 
THAN YOUR HOUSE.

206
00:07:57,392 --> 00:07:58,936
OH, THAT'S HOW WE JOKE.

207
00:07:58,936 --> 00:08:00,855
SHE DOESN'T EVEN HAVE A HOUSE.

208
00:08:03,232 --> 00:08:06,318
narrator: THE NEXT DAY, 
TOBIAS LOOKED FOR WORK.

209
00:08:06,318 --> 00:08:08,237
- HMM, ACTOR PULL.

210
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:16,829
OOH.

211
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:19,540
OH, LOOK AT ALL THESE PARTS.

212
00:08:23,043 --> 00:08:25,170
- TOBIAS, 
NICE TO SEE YOU OFF THE COUCH.

213
00:08:25,170 --> 00:08:29,509
- I WAS LOOKING FOR WORK, 
AND I BLEW IT, MICHAEL.

214
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:32,136
- I GUESS YOU'VE ALREADY 
SEEN THAT, HUH?

215
00:08:32,136 --> 00:08:33,888
- YES, I HAVE.

216
00:08:33,888 --> 00:08:35,472
OH, RIGHT, THIS ONE.

217
00:08:35,472 --> 00:08:37,975
YEAH, I'LL CALL THEM AGAIN, 
I GUESS.

218
00:08:37,975 --> 00:08:40,394
I'LL GIVE THEM ONE MORE SHOT.

219
00:08:40,394 --> 00:08:41,979
narrator: AND THAT'S 
WHEN MICHAEL FIGURED OUT

220
00:08:41,979 --> 00:08:43,689
HOW TO GET HIS MOTHER 
TO LEAD HIM

221
00:08:43,689 --> 00:08:46,859
TO THE STORAGE UNIT WHERE 
THE FLIGHT RECORDS WERE KEPT.

222
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:49,361
[cell phone rings]

223
00:08:49,361 --> 00:08:51,488
- HELLO. 
- HEY, MOM, IT'S MICHAEL.

224
00:08:51,488 --> 00:08:53,866
LISTEN, BEFORE I FORGET, 
I TALKED TO THE I.R.S.,

225
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:55,993
AND THEY WANNA COME BY 
YOUR APARTMENT TODAY

226
00:08:55,993 --> 00:08:58,996
TO SEE IF YOU CHARGED ANY 
BIG-TICKET STUFF TO THE COMPANY,

227
00:08:58,996 --> 00:09:03,125
FURS OR...I DON'T KNOW.

228
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:04,544
JUST A HEADS-UP.

229
00:09:07,379 --> 00:09:09,632
OH, THAT POOR WOMAN.

230
00:09:11,801 --> 00:09:14,219
narrator: 
SO MICHAEL FOLLOWED LUZ,

231
00:09:14,219 --> 00:09:16,639
WHO HAD BEEN SENT TO HIDE 
THE EVIDENCE.

232
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:18,724
MEANWHILE, 
TOBIAS HAD ARRANGED AN AUDITION

233
00:09:18,724 --> 00:09:20,184
FOR A LOCAL COMMERCIAL.

234
00:09:20,184 --> 00:09:22,477
LINDSAY CAME ALONG 
TO APPEAR SUPPORTIVE.

235
00:09:22,477 --> 00:09:24,104
- THIS COULD TAKE A WHILE.

236
00:09:24,104 --> 00:09:26,231
- HONEY, IT'S ONE LINE.

237
00:09:26,231 --> 00:09:28,651
- NOT IF I DO MY JOB RIGHT.

238
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:31,361
FIRST OF ALL, I LOVE IT.

239
00:09:31,361 --> 00:09:32,362
QUICK QUESTION, THOUGH.

240
00:09:32,362 --> 00:09:34,657
AM I PANICKED ABOUT THE FIRE,

241
00:09:34,657 --> 00:09:37,201
OR AM I BEING BRAVE 
FOR EVERYONE ELSE?

242
00:09:37,201 --> 00:09:41,205
- THE FIRE...IT'S... 
IT'S A FIRE SALE.

243
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:46,376
- OH.

244
00:09:46,376 --> 00:09:48,503
OKAY, I DIDN'T, UM...

245
00:09:48,503 --> 00:09:52,174
WELL, LET'S GIVE IT A SHOT.

246
00:09:52,174 --> 00:09:53,843
OH, MY GOD.

247
00:09:53,843 --> 00:09:56,762
WE'RE HAVING A FIRE...SALE.

248
00:09:56,762 --> 00:09:58,347
OH, THE BURNING.

249
00:09:58,347 --> 00:10:00,182
IT BURNS ME.

250
00:10:00,182 --> 00:10:02,602
EVACUATE ALL 
SCHOOLCHILDREN.

251
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:03,728
[screaming]

252
00:10:03,728 --> 00:10:05,813
[singing] 
AMAAAA...

253
00:10:05,813 --> 00:10:07,022
THIS ISN'T A FEVER.

254
00:10:07,022 --> 00:10:08,774
[singing] 
ZING GRACE.

255
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:10,610
I CAN'T EVEN SEE 
WHERE THE KNOB IS.

256
00:10:19,076 --> 00:10:21,078
AND SCENE.

257
00:10:21,078 --> 00:10:24,081
- UM...

258
00:10:24,081 --> 00:10:27,167
WOULD YOU LIKE TO TRY THAT 
A LITTLE SIMPLER, MAYBE?

259
00:10:28,794 --> 00:10:31,631
- NO.

260
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:35,384
- OKAY, ANYBODY ELSE?

261
00:10:35,384 --> 00:10:37,803
ANYONE?

262
00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:39,680
LINDSAY BLUTH?

263
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:40,681
- IT'S FUNKE.

264
00:10:40,681 --> 00:10:41,724
- ROGER DANISH.

265
00:10:41,724 --> 00:10:42,975
- LOOK AT YOU.

266
00:10:42,975 --> 00:10:44,184
I CAN'T BELIEVE 
IT'S LINDSAY BLUTH.

267
00:10:44,184 --> 00:10:45,770
- OH. 
- FUNKE.

268
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:49,815
- ROGER WAS MY MALE COUNTERPART 
IN HIGH SCHOOL.

269
00:10:49,815 --> 00:10:52,151
- REMEMBER HOW CRAZY 
OUR HAIR WAS BACK THEN?

270
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:53,653
- WHAT WERE WE THINKING?

271
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:55,029
SO WHAT ARE YOU DOING NOW?

272
00:10:55,029 --> 00:10:57,031
- HE'S, UH, 
CASTING MY COMMERCIAL.

273
00:10:57,031 --> 00:10:58,448
- YEAH, TRYING TO.

274
00:10:58,448 --> 00:11:00,826
THE SOUTH COAST BOUTIQUE 
IS HAVING A FIRE SALE.

275
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:02,703
- SOUTH COAST BOUTIQUE?

276
00:11:02,703 --> 00:11:04,496
THEY'RE HAVING A FIRE SALE?

277
00:11:09,293 --> 00:11:11,378
narrator: MEANWHILE, 
MICHAEL WAS STILL FOLLOWING

278
00:11:11,378 --> 00:11:15,632
HIS MOTHER'S HOUSEKEEPER.

279
00:11:18,761 --> 00:11:22,514
AND SHE DID FINALLY LEAD HIM 
TO THE STORAGE UNIT.

280
00:11:22,514 --> 00:11:25,976
UNFORTUNATELY, 
IT WAS ON FIRE.

281
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:33,483
- SOMEBODY WANTED THIS PLACE 
TO GO.

282
00:11:33,483 --> 00:11:35,069
- YEAH? 
WHAT DO YOU MEAN, ARSON?

283
00:11:35,069 --> 00:11:38,072
- OH, DEFINITELY THE WORK 
OF A FLAMER.

284
00:11:53,921 --> 00:11:55,840
- [shouting indistinctly]

285
00:11:59,343 --> 00:12:02,679
- IT SHOOTS TOMORROW, 
AND ARE YOU READY FOR THIS?

286
00:12:02,679 --> 00:12:05,891
IT PAYS 1,000 BUCKS.

287
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:07,726
- MM, 
I THOUGHT THAT WAS TOBIAS' PART.

288
00:12:07,726 --> 00:12:09,979
- YES 
NO, NO, I DID NOT BOOK THIS ONE.

289
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:11,939
I, UH... 
I THINK I MADE THE, UH,

290
00:12:11,939 --> 00:12:14,524
FIRE TOO REAL, UH, FOR THEM, 
AND, UH...

291
00:12:14,524 --> 00:12:17,027
AND PROBABLY FAILED 
TO HIGHLIGHT THE SALE,

292
00:12:17,027 --> 00:12:19,488
SO GOOD FOR HER, AND, UH,

293
00:12:19,488 --> 00:12:21,281
WILL YOU EXCUSE ME, PLEASE?

294
00:12:21,281 --> 00:12:23,158
[chuckling]

295
00:12:23,158 --> 00:12:26,578
- WELL, THAT'S GREAT, 
BUT I'VE GOT MY OWN PROBLEMS.

296
00:12:26,578 --> 00:12:28,747
THE FLIGHT RECORDS, 
THEY'VE BURNED UP.

297
00:12:28,747 --> 00:12:30,374
THAT'S FINE. 
THAT'S OVER WITH.

298
00:12:30,374 --> 00:12:32,793
BUT I THINK DAD IS BEHIND IT.

299
00:12:32,793 --> 00:12:35,587
I THINK DAD IS TRYING TO RUN 
THE BUSINESS FROM PRISON.

300
00:12:35,587 --> 00:12:37,047
- WELL, ISN'T THAT IRONIC?

301
00:12:37,047 --> 00:12:39,008
I'M MAKING A FORTUNE 
AT MY NEW JOB,

302
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:41,676
AND YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE THE JOB 
YOU THOUGHT YOU DID.

303
00:12:41,676 --> 00:12:43,720
- BUT YOU DON'T HAVE A JOB. 
YOU'VE GOT A JOB OFFER.

304
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:45,514
ANYBODY CAN GET A JOB OFFER.

305
00:12:45,514 --> 00:12:49,684
- [sobbing]

306
00:12:49,684 --> 00:12:51,270
- SO I'M GONNA GO SEE DAD,

307
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:51,871
BECAUSE THIS IS MY BUSINESS 
TO RUN NOW.

308
00:12:51,871 --> 00:12:57,442
- YOUR BUSINESS?

309
00:12:57,442 --> 00:12:59,611
- HEY, THERE YOU ARE, GOB.

310
00:12:59,611 --> 00:13:01,530
I HAVE BEEN LOOKING ALL OVER 
FOR YOU.

311
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:04,408
I COULD REALLY USE SOME HELP.

312
00:13:04,408 --> 00:13:08,245
- WELL, 
I WAS GONNA RETURN THIS DOVE.

313
00:13:08,245 --> 00:13:09,663
WHAT ARE YOU...

314
00:13:09,663 --> 00:13:11,623
YOU WANT ME TO RUN A MEETING 
FOR YOU OR SOMETHING?

315
00:13:11,623 --> 00:13:14,584
- OR EVEN BETTER, COULD YOU MAIL 
THIS LETTER FOR ME?

316
00:13:14,584 --> 00:13:17,421
- YOU CAN'T JUST GIVE THAT 
TO A MAILMAN?

317
00:13:17,421 --> 00:13:19,924
- I CAN'T TRUST A MAILMAN 
WITH THIS.

318
00:13:19,924 --> 00:13:21,008
THIS IS IMPORTANT.

319
00:13:21,008 --> 00:13:22,467
narrator: 
GOB WAS INTRIGUED.

320
00:13:22,467 --> 00:13:24,553
HE ALSO SUSPECTED 
HE COULDN'T RETURN

321
00:13:24,553 --> 00:13:26,513
A COMPLETELY FROZEN DOVE 
TO A PET STORE

322
00:13:26,513 --> 00:13:29,183
AND GET THE FULL REFUND HE FELT 
HE WAS ENTITLED TO.

323
00:13:29,183 --> 00:13:31,060
- I'LL MAIL THAT LETTER.

324
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:33,812
narrator: MICHAEL THEN WENT 
TO CONFRONT HIS FATHER.

325
00:13:33,812 --> 00:13:36,023
- YOU ARE NOT GOING TO KEEP 
RUNNING THE COMPANY

326
00:13:36,023 --> 00:13:37,816
FROM IN HERE, OKAY?

327
00:13:37,816 --> 00:13:39,484
THAT'S WHY YOU WANTED ME 
TO GIVE T-BONE A JOB,

328
00:13:39,484 --> 00:13:41,320
TO PAY HIM BACK FOR BURNING DOWN 
THE STORAGE UNIT?

329
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,988
- MICHAEL, THAT'S RIDICULOUS.

330
00:13:42,988 --> 00:13:44,781
- WELL, I'M NOT HIRING HIM.

331
00:13:44,781 --> 00:13:46,491
NO. 
WE DON'T HAVE THE MONEY, POP.

332
00:13:46,491 --> 00:13:49,203
- THERE'S ALWAYS MONEY 
IN THE BANANA STAND.

333
00:13:49,203 --> 00:13:50,662
- THE BANANA STAND.

334
00:13:50,662 --> 00:13:54,041
YOU KNOW, THAT'S EXACTLY 
WHAT THIS FEELS LIKE, HUH,

335
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:56,085
LIKE I'M STILL STUCK 
IN THAT HOT BOOTH ALL SUMMER

336
00:13:56,085 --> 00:13:57,127
WITH YOU PULLING THE STRINGS.

337
00:13:57,127 --> 00:13:58,337
- WHAT WAS I GONNA DO, 
PUT A KID

338
00:13:58,337 --> 00:14:00,255
IN CHARGE 
OF A FROZEN BANANA STAND?

339
00:14:00,255 --> 00:14:01,381
- SURE. 
THAT'S WHAT I DID.

340
00:14:01,381 --> 00:14:03,926
I JUST MADE MY SON THE MANAGER.

341
00:14:03,926 --> 00:14:06,971
- GEORGE MICHAEL IS RUNNING 
THE FROZEN BANANA STAND NOW?

342
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:08,722
- THAT'S RIGHT, YEAH. 
YOU SIT WITH THAT.

343
00:14:08,722 --> 00:14:11,058
YOU THINK ABOUT THAT 
FOR A WHILE.

344
00:14:11,058 --> 00:14:14,686
narrator: GEORGE SR. DID THINK 
ABOUT THAT.

345
00:14:17,397 --> 00:14:21,568
- WELL, NOW THAT WE'VE GOT AN 
EMPLOYEE, WE CAN GO HAVE DINNER.

346
00:14:24,738 --> 00:14:26,198
WE THROW AWAY A BANANA 
FOR EVERY BUCK WE TAKE

347
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:28,200
SO NO ONE FINDS OUT.

348
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,702
- WAIT A MINUTE; I THINK YOU 
SHOULD DO THAT MATH AGAIN.

349
00:14:30,702 --> 00:14:32,454
- WHY? 
IS IT WRONG?

350
00:14:32,454 --> 00:14:33,663
- IT'S FINE.

351
00:14:33,663 --> 00:14:35,540
- HE'S AN ARSONIST, 
NOT AN EMBEZZLER.

352
00:14:37,292 --> 00:14:40,504
narrator: MEANWHILE, MICHAEL GOT 
AN URGENT CALL FROM HIS MOTHER.

353
00:14:40,504 --> 00:14:42,839
- GOB IS UNHAPPY.

354
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:44,424
- AGAIN? 
I TRIED TO INCLUDE HIM.

355
00:14:44,424 --> 00:14:45,550
I GAVE HIM A JOB.

356
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:47,261
- YOU GAVE HIM A LETTER TO MAIL.

357
00:14:47,261 --> 00:14:49,138
- DON'T TELL ME THAT WAS 
TOO MUCH FOR HIM.

358
00:14:49,138 --> 00:14:51,015
- NO, MICHAEL. 
HE MAILED THE LETTER.

359
00:14:51,015 --> 00:14:52,474
THAT'S NOT THE POINT.

360
00:14:52,474 --> 00:14:54,059
narrator: 
GOB HAD NOT MAILED THE LETTER,

361
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:55,644
BUT IN AN ACT OF DEFIANCE

362
00:14:55,644 --> 00:15:00,274
DRAMATICALLY HURLED THE LETTER 
INTO THE SEA.

363
00:15:00,274 --> 00:15:03,068
THIS PROVED A MORE DIFFICULT 
DRAMATIC GESTURE

364
00:15:03,068 --> 00:15:06,405
THAN HE'D ANTICIPATED.

365
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:12,411
- [singing breezy, 
latin-tinged music]

366
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:18,333
- SO WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO 
ABOUT IT?

367
00:15:18,333 --> 00:15:19,459
- DON'T TAKE THAT TONE.

368
00:15:19,459 --> 00:15:20,627
- HE'S MY SON.

369
00:15:20,627 --> 00:15:22,922
I WANT YOU TO MAKE HIM 
STOP CALLING ME.

370
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:24,256
[door clicks open]

371
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:26,258
- AM I THE ONLY ONE WHO WORKS 
IN THIS FAMILY?

372
00:15:26,258 --> 00:15:29,594
- [chuckling] 
YES, THAT'S MY GAL.

373
00:15:29,594 --> 00:15:32,973
WHO WOULD HAVE IMAGINED 
TWO ACTORS IN ONE FAMILY?

374
00:15:32,973 --> 00:15:35,892
WE'RE LIKE THE LUNTS.

375
00:15:35,892 --> 00:15:40,230
YOU SEE...EXCUSE ME.

376
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:41,941
- MAMA. 
- muah!

377
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:44,318
narrator: AND SO LINDSAY 
AND MAEBY SEPARATELY WENT

378
00:15:44,318 --> 00:15:46,361
TO THE SAME RESTAURANT 
TO CELEBRATE THE JOBS

379
00:15:46,361 --> 00:15:48,113
THEY HADN'T 
ACTUALLY PERFORMED

380
00:15:48,113 --> 00:15:50,950
WITH MONEY THEY HADN'T 
ACTUALLY EARNED.

381
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:53,118
- DID YOU ENJOY YOUR MEAL, MOM?' 
YOU DRANK IT FAST ENOUGH.

382
00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:54,328
- HI, LUCILLE.

383
00:15:54,328 --> 00:15:56,288
- NOT AS MUCH AS YOU 
ENJOYED YOURS.

384
00:15:56,288 --> 00:15:58,707
YOU WANT YOUR BELT TO BUCKLE, 
NOT YOUR CHAIR.

385
00:15:58,707 --> 00:16:01,543
- OKAY, THIS IS WHAT I TOLD 
TOBIAS YOU'D DO.

386
00:16:01,543 --> 00:16:02,669
SAY WHAT YOU WILL ABOUT HIM.

387
00:16:02,669 --> 00:16:04,713
AT LEAST HE'S HAPPY FOR ME.

388
00:16:04,713 --> 00:16:08,717
- [sobbing]

389
00:16:08,717 --> 00:16:12,221
- YOU KNOW, I THINK WE MIGHT BE 
DOUBLING OUR LOSSES HERE.

390
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:14,098
BECAUSE, I MEAN, 
FOR EVERY DOLLAR YOU TAKE,

391
00:16:14,098 --> 00:16:16,183
WE'RE ACTUALLY TAKING 
TWO DOLLARS,

392
00:16:16,183 --> 00:16:18,978
BECAUSE WE PAID FOR THE BANANAS.

393
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:21,105
- [chuckles] 
OH, MY GOD, YOU'RE RIGHT.

394
00:16:21,105 --> 00:16:22,689
- I AM?

395
00:16:22,689 --> 00:16:24,774
OH, GOD, I'VE SCREWED THIS UP.

396
00:16:24,774 --> 00:16:26,693
OKAY, WE GOTTA GO.

397
00:16:26,693 --> 00:16:27,861
OH, MY GOD.

398
00:16:27,861 --> 00:16:29,821
IT'S YOUR MOM AND GANGY.

399
00:16:29,821 --> 00:16:31,531
- WHAT ARE THEY DOING HERE? 
- THEY'RE GROWN-UPS.

400
00:16:31,531 --> 00:16:33,075
THEY'RE ALLOWED TO HAVE FUN 
WHENEVER THEY WANT.

401
00:16:33,075 --> 00:16:34,659
WE'RE KIDS. 
WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE WORKING.

402
00:16:34,659 --> 00:16:36,286
NOW THEY'RE GONNA TELL MY DAD,

403
00:16:36,286 --> 00:16:37,537
AND HE'S GONNA COME CHECK 
THE TOTALS AND KNOW

404
00:16:37,537 --> 00:16:38,913
WE TOOK THE MONEY.

405
00:16:38,913 --> 00:16:40,207
OH, GOD, THIS IS BAD.

406
00:16:40,207 --> 00:16:41,458
- LOOK... 
- WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?

407
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:43,418
- POP-POP, 
HE'S A BUSINESS MAN.

408
00:16:43,418 --> 00:16:46,046
WHAT WOULD HE DO?

409
00:16:46,046 --> 00:16:49,383
- BANANAS FOSTER.

410
00:16:52,594 --> 00:16:54,346
- YOU MIGHT WANNA LET 
THAT FIRE GO OUT

411
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:55,597
BEFORE YOU STICK YOUR FACE 
IN IT.

412
00:16:55,597 --> 00:16:56,890
- THAT'S FUNNY, 
'CAUSE I WAS GONNA SAY,

413
00:16:56,890 --> 00:16:58,433
"YOU MIGHT WANNA LEAN AWAY 
FROM THAT FIRE

414
00:16:58,433 --> 00:17:00,435
SINCE YOU'RE SOAKED IN ALCOHOL."

415
00:17:00,435 --> 00:17:03,480
- MINE WAS BETTER.

416
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:06,441
- WELCOME TO BLUTH BANANAS, 
WHERE BANANAS ARE OUR BUSINESS.

417
00:17:06,441 --> 00:17:08,527
MAY I INTEREST YOU IN A BANANA 
THIS DAY?

418
00:17:08,527 --> 00:17:10,070
- T-BONE, 
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

419
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:12,614
- OH, YOUR DAD GAVE ME THIS JOB.

420
00:17:12,614 --> 00:17:14,866
narrator: MICHAEL REALIZED 
THAT HIS FATHER

421
00:17:14,866 --> 00:17:17,994
HAD EVEN TAKEN CONTROL 
OF THE BANANA STAND,

422
00:17:17,994 --> 00:17:20,080
BUT HE STILL HAD 
SOME UNANSWERED QUESTIONS,

423
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:21,248
SO HE DID 
A LITTLE DETECTIVE WORK.

424
00:17:21,248 --> 00:17:23,250
- YOU BURN DOWN 
THE STORAGE UNIT?

425
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:25,960
- OH, MOST DEFINITELY.

426
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:32,217
- MICHAEL, HAVING A NICE DAY 
AT THE BEACH,

427
00:17:32,217 --> 00:17:35,637
WHILE THE REST OF US ARE BUSTING 
OUR ASSES TO DELIVER YOUR MAIL?

428
00:17:35,637 --> 00:17:37,764
- WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO SAY, 
OKAY?

429
00:17:37,764 --> 00:17:40,142
YOU GO AND COMPLAIN TO MOM, 
AND I TRIED TO INCLUDE YOU.

430
00:17:40,142 --> 00:17:41,393
- INCLUDE ME? 
- YEAH.

431
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:42,727
- I SHOULD BE IN CHARGE.

432
00:17:42,727 --> 00:17:43,978
I'M THE OLDER BROTHER.

433
00:17:43,978 --> 00:17:45,105
- PLEASE, DO YOU EVEN WANT 
TO BE IN CHARGE?

434
00:17:45,105 --> 00:17:48,608
- NO, 
BUT I'D LIKE TO BE ASKED.

435
00:17:48,608 --> 00:17:49,693
THIS IS JUST LIKE 
WHEN WE WERE KIDS,

436
00:17:49,693 --> 00:17:52,237
AND YOU WERE THE ONLY ONE 
HE LET WORK IN THE BANANA STAND.

437
00:17:52,237 --> 00:17:54,156
- WELL, I GOT NEWS FOR YOU, GOB,

438
00:17:54,156 --> 00:17:55,865
DAD STILL DOESN'T TRUST ME 
TO THIS DAY.

439
00:17:55,865 --> 00:17:57,492
HE TREATS ME LIKE 
A LOW-LEVEL EMPLOYEE.

440
00:17:57,492 --> 00:18:00,245
- BETTER THAN BEING TREATED 
LIKE THE GOOFBALL,

441
00:18:00,245 --> 00:18:03,457
THE JOKER, 
THE MAGICIAN.

442
00:18:05,709 --> 00:18:07,252
- I THOUGHT YOU WERE GONNA DO, 
LIKE, A TRICK THERE,

443
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:08,545
LIKE THE FIREBALL OR SOMETHING.

444
00:18:08,545 --> 00:18:09,588
- I WAS. 
IT DIDN'T GO OFF.

445
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:11,506
- THESE THINGS NEVER GO OFF 
WHEN YOU WANT THEM TO,

446
00:18:11,506 --> 00:18:12,674
MY LEAST-CONSISTENT TRICK.

447
00:18:12,674 --> 00:18:14,343
- HANG ON ONE SEC. 
- HELLO.

448
00:18:14,343 --> 00:18:15,927
- HEY, UNCLE MICHAEL, 
IT'S ME, MAEBY.

449
00:18:15,927 --> 00:18:17,137
- HEY, MAEBY, 
WHERE'S GEORGE MICHAEL?

450
00:18:17,137 --> 00:18:18,472
- AT THE BANANA STAND.

451
00:18:18,472 --> 00:18:22,226
HE'S ABOUT TO DO SOMETHING 
REALLY IRRESPONSIBLE.

452
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:23,727
- YOU THINK IT'S IRRESPONSIBLE?

453
00:18:23,727 --> 00:18:26,438
I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.

454
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:28,107
- I'M GONNA GET BLAMED FOR THIS.

455
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:29,941
- GEORGE MICHAEL. 
- DAD.

456
00:18:29,941 --> 00:18:31,735
- HEY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

457
00:18:31,735 --> 00:18:34,738
- I WAS JUST, UH...

458
00:18:34,738 --> 00:18:36,698
I WAS BURNING DOWN 
THE BANANA STAND.

459
00:18:36,698 --> 00:18:37,991
- WHAT? 
- I'M SORRY, DAD.

460
00:18:37,991 --> 00:18:39,409
I SCREWED IT ALL UP.

461
00:18:39,409 --> 00:18:41,536
I'VE GOT NO RIGHT TO CALL MYSELF 
MR. MANAGER.

462
00:18:41,536 --> 00:18:42,829
- MANAGER. 
- MANAGER.

463
00:18:42,829 --> 00:18:44,414
- I'M SORRY, DAD. 
- OH, GEORGE MICHAEL.

464
00:18:44,414 --> 00:18:46,541
- I AM, 
BUT I'LL MAKE IT UP TO YOU.

465
00:18:46,541 --> 00:18:48,502
I'LL WORK WEEKNIGHTS. 
I'LL LAY PEOPLE OFF.

466
00:18:48,502 --> 00:18:50,379
I'LL GIVE UP MY SUMMER, 
ALL MY SUMMERS.

467
00:18:50,379 --> 00:18:52,547
JUST TELL ME WHAT TO DO, 
AND I'LL DO IT.

468
00:18:52,547 --> 00:18:54,299
narrator: MICHAEL REALIZED HE 
HAD DONE TO HIS SON

469
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:56,885
WHAT HIS FATHER HAD DONE 
TO HIM,

470
00:18:56,885 --> 00:18:59,179
SO HE CAME UP WITH A SOLUTION.

471
00:18:59,179 --> 00:19:00,847
- BURN IT DOWN.

472
00:19:00,847 --> 00:19:02,641
- WHAT?

473
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:07,020
- LET'S BURN 
THIS SON OF A BITCH.

474
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:19,032
- THIS IS GONNA BE 
OUR BEST SUMMER EVER, BUDDY.

475
00:19:21,785 --> 00:19:23,828
narrator: AND SO, MICHAEL, 
HIS SON,

476
00:19:23,828 --> 00:19:25,997
AND HIS BROTHER 
TOGETHER ENJOYED

477
00:19:25,997 --> 00:19:28,917
THE CATHARTIC BURNING 
OF THE BANANA STAND.

478
00:19:28,917 --> 00:19:32,086
YOU MAILED THAT INSURANCE CHECK, 
RIGHT, GOB?

479
00:19:35,674 --> 00:19:37,133
- [singing] 
AND WE'VE BEEN TAKIN' CARE

480
00:19:37,133 --> 00:19:39,803
OF BUSINESS EVERY DAY

481
00:19:39,803 --> 00:19:43,014
TAKIN' CARE OF BUSINESS 
EVERY WAY

482
00:19:43,014 --> 00:19:45,850
WE'VE BEEN TAKIN' CARE 
OF BUSINESS

483
00:19:45,850 --> 00:19:47,060
IT'S ALL RIGHT

484
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:49,354
narrator: THE NEXT MORNING, 
LINDSAY WOKE UP LATE IN THE DAY

485
00:19:49,354 --> 00:19:51,731
HUNGOVER FROM CELEBRATING 
HER ONE DAY OF EMPLOYMENT,

486
00:19:51,731 --> 00:19:54,234
WHICH, IT TURNS OUT, 
SHE HAD SLEPT THROUGH.

487
00:19:54,234 --> 00:19:55,819
- ALL RIGHT, LINDSAY, FORGET IT.

488
00:19:55,819 --> 00:19:57,237
WE'LL GET SOMEONE ELSE.

489
00:19:57,237 --> 00:19:59,113
narrator: TOBIAS WAS NEXT 
ON THE CALL LIST,

490
00:19:59,113 --> 00:20:01,115
BUT, UNFORTUNATELY, 
COULDN'T HEAR THE PHONE

491
00:20:01,115 --> 00:20:04,536
OVER THE SOUND OF THE SHOWER.

492
00:20:04,536 --> 00:20:06,955
HE DID, HOWEVER, 
USE LINDSAY'S CONDITIONER

493
00:20:06,955 --> 00:20:10,209
AND WAS SURPRISED TO FIND THAT 
IT DID HELP HIS SELF-ESTEEM.

494
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:11,960
- MORNIN'. 
- YOU LOOK NICE.

495
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,086
- WHAT?

496
00:20:13,086 --> 00:20:15,088
- YOU LOOK VERY HANDSOME TODAY.

497
00:20:15,088 --> 00:20:18,717
- THANK YOU, LINDSAY.

498
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:20,093
narrator: 
AND MICHAEL FINALLY GOT

499
00:20:20,093 --> 00:20:21,845
TO SHOW HIS FATHER WHO'S BOSS.

500
00:20:21,845 --> 00:20:22,971
- YOU WHAT?

501
00:20:22,971 --> 00:20:24,806
- BURNED IT RIGHT DOWN 
TO THE GROUND

502
00:20:24,806 --> 00:20:26,391
- ARE YOU CRAZY?

503
00:20:26,391 --> 00:20:28,352
THERE WAS MONEY 
IN THAT BANANA STAND.

504
00:20:28,352 --> 00:20:31,187
- WELL, IT'S ALL GONE NOW, DAD, 
AND IT WAS MY DECISION.

505
00:20:31,187 --> 00:20:33,357
SO THE NEXT TIME YOU WANNA HAVE 
A LITTLE POWER STRUGGLE,

506
00:20:33,357 --> 00:20:35,775
JUST REMEMBER 
THAT YOU'RE PLAYING WITH FIRE.

507
00:20:35,775 --> 00:20:40,447
- THERE WAS $250,000 LINING 
THE WALLS OF THE BANANA STAND.

508
00:20:40,447 --> 00:20:42,241
- WHAT?

509
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:43,825
- CASH, MICHAEL.

510
00:20:43,825 --> 00:20:44,993
- WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME THAT?

511
00:20:44,993 --> 00:20:46,953
- HOW MUCH CLEARER CAN I SAY,

512
00:20:46,953 --> 00:20:50,707
"THERE'S ALWAYS MONEY 
IN THE BANANA STAND"?

513
00:20:50,707 --> 00:20:52,251
- NO TOUCHING. 
- NO TOUCHING.

514
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:53,252

516
00:20:57,714 --> 00:21:01,426
GOB PROTESTS THE PET STORE'S 
FROZEN DOVE EXCHANGE POLICY.

517
00:21:01,426 --> 00:21:03,928
- RETURN FROM WHENCE YOU CAME.

518
00:21:03,928 --> 00:21:05,972
AND, MICHAEL, 
REALIZING THE BANANA STAND

519
00:21:05,972 --> 00:21:08,600
IS THE ONLY PROFITABLE PART 
OF THE BLUTH EMPIRE,

520
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,269
DECIDES TO REBUILD.

521
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:12,145
- YOU COULDN'T HAVE CALLED ME?

522
00:21:12,145 --> 00:21:14,939
I CAN'T SWING A HAMMER?

523
00:21:14,939 --> 00:21:16,441
- I GOT A RABBIT TO BUY.
