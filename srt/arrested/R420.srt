Gene Parmesan got photos of Herbert Love
with some redheaded whore.

8
00:00:39,289 --> 00:00:42,250
I'm giving his wife a taste,
so he knows we know.

10

-Oh, no!
-Yeah, you're a whore.

I wanna hire her for prostitution.

21
00:01:11,613 --> 00:01:13,782

22
00:01:13,865 --> 00:01:16,993

-I'm gonna charge you for that.

24

25
00:01:23,666 --> 00:01:25,543
Wait, why are you in high school?

26
00:01:25,627 --> 00:01:27,337
Didn't we graduate together
five years ago?

27
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:29,964
<i>...she felt confident her acting</i>
<i>as a madam</i>

28

29
00:01:31,341 --> 00:01:32,634
I could call him for you.

30

-Well, the sooner the better.
-Got to get Marky out of jail.

-I'm sorry.
-Why would you do that?

37
00:01:49,275 --> 00:01:50,860
I want you to be my key adviser.

38
00:01:50,944 --> 00:01:54,781
She's gonna need a key to my room,
I'd advise you to use it when I call you.

39

<i>But Maeby had missed a key fact</i>

He's a cop.

42

There might be an undercover cop
at this school.

43
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:07,710
You've gotta pull it together, missy,
or you're not going to graduate.

44

-Wow. So sweet.

Just six weeks ago, I was a hot mess.

70

Excellent. Mom.

You've been flirting with me

93

{\an8}<i>In fact,</i>
<i>Buster had been exquisitely trained</i>

He wants a second chance
and I want to give it to him.

168
00:08:55,326 --> 00:08:58,204
So you were just using me to hurt him?

169
00:08:58,621 --> 00:08:59,497
Yes.

170
00:09:00,581 --> 00:09:01,707
[quietly] Thank you.

171
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:05,211
But what about me? What happens to me?

172
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:08,798
I certainly can't go back
to you as my mother.

173
00:09:09,131 --> 00:09:11,968
After I've zipped down,
you can't expect me to zip up!

174
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:14,637
I know that. But you have to leave.

175
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:18,724
No, I'm okay with the mothering.
He had you first. I'm here to stay.

176
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:21,185
This is just
a little mother-son bump in the road.

177
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:23,896
Your hand is broken again.

178
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,857
No, it's just my heart.

179
00:09:28,109 --> 00:09:29,735
It's my hand, too, actually.

180
00:09:30,444 --> 00:09:31,529
I'm sorry, Buster.

181
00:09:31,612 --> 00:09:33,114
<i>Buster was blindsided.</i>

182
00:09:33,197 --> 00:09:37,577
Ophelia!<i> </i>Tell me this.
Who is the better lover?

183
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:38,995
-He is.
-He is. Okay.

184
00:09:40,121 --> 00:09:41,622
What about son?

185
00:09:41,706 --> 00:09:43,165
<i>Buster was upset</i>

186
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:48,212
<i>and perhaps that's why he availed himself</i>
<i>of the photos of Herbert</i>

187
00:09:48,296 --> 00:09:51,757
<i>and the prostitute he didn't realize</i>
<i>was actually his sister.</i>

188
00:09:54,343 --> 00:09:55,636
[wails]

189
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:58,931
<i>Before using the wrong hand</i>
<i>to punch a picture of Herbert.</i>

190
00:09:59,015 --> 00:10:00,308
Stupid Bust--

191
00:10:05,062 --> 00:10:09,567
<i>And as Tobias' musical went</i>
<i>into its final rehearsal process,</i>

192
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:14,405
<i>DeBrie still had butterflies...</i>
<i>along with the worms,</i>

193
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:17,783
<i>and Lucille was taking to her role</i>
<i>as the bad guy.</i>

194
00:10:17,867 --> 00:10:20,536
Is anyone going to tell her
she needs to lose weight?

195
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,288
Because I'm not buying invisible,

196
00:10:22,371 --> 00:10:25,750
and you don't want to be out there
on a raft that's listing.

197
00:10:28,085 --> 00:10:32,089
<i>And soon, the ragtag troupe</i>
<i>of substance abusers showed up</i>

198
00:10:32,173 --> 00:10:33,758
<i>for their big moment on stage.</i>

199
00:10:33,841 --> 00:10:35,259
Fan Four, company meeting.

200
00:10:35,343 --> 00:10:38,804
Everybody has made a commitment to stay
in the program for at least 30 more days,

201
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:42,516
but I think we can all afford one night
of intense pressure, yes?

202
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,602
We're all hoofers,
we can take the pressure.

203
00:10:44,685 --> 00:10:48,105
- Argyle, not helping!
-Yeah, sorry, Cinco de Mayo!

204
00:10:48,898 --> 00:10:51,776
-Does anybody have any questions?
-Hey, I got a question.

205
00:10:51,859 --> 00:10:54,487
You're sure the Hispanic community's
okay with this?

206
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:57,114
You're not worried about some blowback
of some sort?

207
00:10:57,198 --> 00:10:58,908
They think of this as an homage.

208
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:01,661
I'm going to go put on
my rock monster outfit

209
00:11:01,744 --> 00:11:04,163
and pass out fliers.
Take any boat to the float.

210
00:11:04,246 --> 00:11:06,874
<i>And Lindsay, despite her promise to Marky,</i>

211
00:11:06,957 --> 00:11:10,086
<i>felt she owed it to Love</i>
<i>to protect him from the threat.</i>

212
00:11:10,461 --> 00:11:13,214
I have some inside information
you really need to know.

213
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:14,965
<i>But as it turned out,</i>

214
00:11:15,049 --> 00:11:17,927
<i>Herbert had some undercover information</i>
<i>for her, too.</i>

215
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:20,471
I cannot be under the covers
with you anymore.

216
00:11:20,554 --> 00:11:22,181
It's over between us.

217
00:11:22,264 --> 00:11:25,351
My wife found out. I told her
there was nothing emotional,

218
00:11:25,434 --> 00:11:28,562
-that you were just a prostitute.
-I'm not a prostitute.

219
00:11:28,646 --> 00:11:32,274
Oh, I know, I know. A sex worker.
The point is, we are through.

220
00:11:32,858 --> 00:11:35,778
Here's a little severance package
for servicing my package.

221
00:11:35,861 --> 00:11:38,114
<i>Lindsay tried</i>
<i>to throw the money in his face,</i>

222
00:11:40,449 --> 00:11:42,702
<i>but she didn't have the muscle memory</i>
<i>for it.</i>

223
00:11:42,785 --> 00:11:44,370
-She's keeping it.
-Oh, good.

224
00:11:44,453 --> 00:11:46,580
What was that you wanted to warn me about?

225
00:11:46,789 --> 00:11:47,915
I have herpes.

226
00:11:48,499 --> 00:11:52,503
No problem, you probably got 'em from me.
And don't forget to vote.

227
00:11:52,586 --> 00:11:56,006
This isn't over. I'm not some taco
you can throw into the bay.

228
00:11:58,843 --> 00:12:01,512
<i>And that's when she ran into her daughter</i>

229
00:12:01,595 --> 00:12:04,515
<i>who was seeking out a payment</i>
<i>from Herbert Love herself.</i>

230
00:12:04,598 --> 00:12:09,437
I need to apologize to you. That check
you've been looking for, I had it.

231
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:10,688
"Had"?

232
00:12:10,771 --> 00:12:13,691
It's not everything,
but here's some money.

233
00:12:15,359 --> 00:12:16,652
Mom, let go.

234
00:12:17,486 --> 00:12:20,030
It's dirty money anyway.
Love gave it to me.

235
00:12:20,114 --> 00:12:23,242
-He gave you money directly?
-If you can believe that.

236
00:12:23,325 --> 00:12:25,327
Anyway, this is your money now,

237
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:28,080
and if you choose
to do work on your face...

238
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:31,167
I mean, the nose, right?

239
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:37,298
<i>Maeby felt bad,</i>
<i>but mostly about her rep on the street.</i>

240
00:12:37,715 --> 00:12:40,718
So he's trying to snake the bottom bitch
from my stable?

241
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:45,723
<i>But Maeby wasn't the only one</i>
<i>with a reputation that needed protection.</i>

242
00:12:45,806 --> 00:12:48,559
Who would bring kids here?
This is no place for...

243
00:12:48,642 --> 00:12:50,227
I'm a registered sex offender.

244
00:12:50,811 --> 00:12:52,521
All right. I'm a regis...

245
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:55,858
I'm a registered sex offender.
I'm a registered sex offender.

246
00:12:55,941 --> 00:12:59,487
Hi, Tobias Fünke, registered sex offender.
Registered sex offender.

247
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:02,698
Registered sex offender... Yeah.

248
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:08,454
<i>Maeby sought out some muscle</i>

249
00:13:08,537 --> 00:13:11,457
<i>to get even with a man</i>
<i>she felt stole money from her,</i>

250
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:14,585
He's a bully. I want you
to bad cop him for me a little, OK?

251
00:13:14,668 --> 00:13:15,920
So where is this bully?

252
00:13:16,003 --> 00:13:17,338
He's right there.

253
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:21,217
-The little guy with the cigarette?
-No, the ripped black guy behind him.

254
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:25,554
Oh. Right, I just...
I just didn't look up high enough.

255
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:26,639
Yeah, well...

256
00:13:26,722 --> 00:13:31,685
<i>Tobias couldn't be within 1,000 yards</i>
<i>of the audience he'd hoped to wow.</i>

257
00:13:32,436 --> 00:13:35,481
<i>And that's when fate dealt him a new hand.</i>

258
00:13:35,564 --> 00:13:37,274
Oh, thank God. I need your help.

259
00:13:37,358 --> 00:13:40,945
I've got a show to do in ten minutes
and I haven't got a thing to wear.

260
00:13:41,028 --> 00:13:42,029
This "Thing" suit.

261
00:13:42,112 --> 00:13:44,365
I've gotta find Lucille Two,
I gotta give her pictures.

262
00:13:44,448 --> 00:13:46,450
-I don't know the songs.
-It's pre-recorded.

263
00:13:46,534 --> 00:13:48,536
And the dance is simplicity itself.

264
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:51,121
You're a monster,
you don't have to be good.

265
00:13:51,205 --> 00:13:53,499
-What?
-Now just go "Thing" your heart out

266
00:13:53,582 --> 00:13:56,168
and don't be put off
by the freakishly large...

267
00:13:56,252 --> 00:13:58,546
What? God! Okay, well, good.

268
00:13:58,629 --> 00:14:01,006
Then just the one glove will do, and...

269
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:02,591
Perfecto!

270
00:14:03,175 --> 00:14:07,304
<i>And that's when Perfecto recogized</i>
<i>a friend he'd seen before...</i>

271
00:14:07,388 --> 00:14:10,140
This table is
for National Honor Society members only.

272
00:14:10,724 --> 00:14:14,770
Really? Well, what about these two guys?
Were they invited?

273
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:17,606
Light Drizzle and Thunder.

274
00:14:18,232 --> 00:14:21,068
<i>In fact, the undercover cop was there</i>

275
00:14:21,151 --> 00:14:23,737
<i>as Buster was awarded</i>
<i>an anti-bullying badge.</i>

276
00:14:23,821 --> 00:14:26,198
You're never too old
to stand up to a bully.

277
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:30,369
Whether he's an attention-hog who
looks just like you or half your size.

278
00:14:30,452 --> 00:14:34,456
<i>"This," Perfecto thought, "was a man</i>
<i>who could bully a bully."</i>

279
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:35,833
And he's a real bully.

280
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:38,711
He's taking money from this innocent
young high school girl.

281
00:14:38,794 --> 00:14:40,254
I don't think I can help you.

282
00:14:40,337 --> 00:14:42,381
I don't want to be a monster anymore.

283
00:14:42,464 --> 00:14:46,093
Can't you just show him a little Thunder?
Just to scare him a bit?

284
00:14:46,677 --> 00:14:49,513
<i>And that's when Buster saw</i>
<i>the woman he'd come for.</i>

285
00:14:49,597 --> 00:14:52,349
I'm sorry.
I have to take care of something.

286
00:14:54,351 --> 00:14:55,686
Lucille Two.

287
00:14:55,769 --> 00:14:58,063
-I've been looking for you.
-Buster!

288
00:14:58,147 --> 00:15:00,357
You look different.
Something's happened to you.

289
00:15:00,441 --> 00:15:02,192
Yes. I've been with a black woman.

290
00:15:02,276 --> 00:15:06,155
-I was talking about your hand.
-This huge thing? Yeah, it's new.

291
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:08,699
Of course, the week after I got it,
the Six came out.

292
00:15:08,782 --> 00:15:11,744
You can play a flute with that one.
It comes with a flute!

293
00:15:11,827 --> 00:15:15,080
But I'm not here about that.
I'm here about this.

294
00:15:15,164 --> 00:15:16,332
What is this?

295
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:19,835
Just pictures of Herbert Love
with a lady of the night.

296
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:23,255
I want you to humiliate him
and win the election.

297
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:24,381
That's my wig!

298
00:15:24,465 --> 00:15:27,384
<i>And she knew exactly who</i>
<i>she'd given it to.</i>

299
00:15:27,968 --> 00:15:30,179
<i>Lindsay wanted to get back at Love...</i>

300
00:15:31,055 --> 00:15:32,806
<i>but not by blowing him up</i>

301
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:36,060
<i>and heading to Mexico</i>
<i>to be with Marky's awful mother.</i>

302
00:15:36,727 --> 00:15:39,772
<i>And that's when she ran into</i>
<i>her own awful mother.</i>

303
00:15:39,855 --> 00:15:42,274
Look who tunneled out?
What are you doing here?

304
00:15:42,358 --> 00:15:44,276
Lindsay, I thought you were a hooker.

305
00:15:45,194 --> 00:15:47,279
It's a wig. No one recognizes me in it.

306
00:15:47,363 --> 00:15:50,908
Oh, I recognized you.
Let me rephrase that more kindly...

307
00:15:51,533 --> 00:15:54,453
I hear you're hooking now
with Herbert Love.

308
00:15:54,536 --> 00:15:56,121
It's called hooking up.

309
00:15:56,205 --> 00:16:00,376
And, yeah, I got a little sidetracked,
but I know who I am now.

310
00:16:00,876 --> 00:16:02,878
I'm back to being severely liberal.

311
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:04,171
Well, like I said,

312
00:16:04,254 --> 00:16:07,758
the one time you were nice enough
to visit me, you are who you are.

313
00:16:07,841 --> 00:16:10,427
A blonde, WASP-y
Orange County princess

314
00:16:10,511 --> 00:16:14,098
who doesn't care about anything
but herself, and that's okay.

315
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:17,142
I'm a Bluth, and so are you.

316
00:16:17,226 --> 00:16:19,395
You really know how to twist the knife.

317
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:23,816
But you are right about one thing,
I don't need this anymore.

318
00:16:23,899 --> 00:16:28,362
<i>Lindsay was done being red,</i>
<i>and she was eager to prove</i>

319
00:16:28,445 --> 00:16:31,865
<i>that both her mother and Herbert Love</i>
<i>were wrong about her.</i>

320
00:16:31,949 --> 00:16:34,660
Lucille Two. I've got great news.

321
00:16:34,743 --> 00:16:37,871
I'm finally available
to become your campaign manager.

322
00:16:37,955 --> 00:16:39,832
Oh, that's lovely, dear.

323
00:16:40,457 --> 00:16:42,918
But I found someone more qualified
than you.

324
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:46,338
-Hello, Lindsay.
-Sally.

325
00:16:46,422 --> 00:16:47,923
<i>It was Sally Sitwell,</i>

326
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:50,843
<i>a woman who'd once been Lindsay's rival.</i>

327
00:16:53,137 --> 00:16:54,513
It's been a while.

328
00:16:55,097 --> 00:16:56,932
How is she more qualified than me?

329
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:58,308
She has integrity.

330
00:16:58,392 --> 00:17:01,186
And look at this hair.
Look at this beautiful, long hair.

331
00:17:02,646 --> 00:17:06,567
I made you a banner.
Look, I can really help this campaign.

332
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:10,738
You already have, more than you know.
Now, give her a little show-and-tell.

333
00:17:12,614 --> 00:17:13,866
Show-and-tell?

334
00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:18,954
Oh, she just means these photos
of Herbert Love with a mystery redhead

335
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:20,622
he's cheating on his wife with.

336
00:17:21,206 --> 00:17:22,207
Who took these?

337
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:24,626
The first two were taken
by the security camera

338
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:26,170
in the Albertsons parking lot.

339
00:17:26,253 --> 00:17:29,256
And the third was left
in the photo booth at the Ealing Club.

340
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,592
God, that was a photo booth?

341
00:17:31,675 --> 00:17:34,303
Lucille has copies.
She wants to go viral with this.

342
00:17:34,386 --> 00:17:37,222
Herbert Love with his hooker?
She'll win for sure.

343
00:17:37,765 --> 00:17:41,268
-I can't let her do that.
-I don't think you can stop her.

344
00:17:42,978 --> 00:17:45,314
Anyway,
it was so great running into you again.

345
00:17:46,982 --> 00:17:48,525
Herbert Love. Herbert Love.

346
00:17:48,609 --> 00:17:50,277
-Herbert Love. Herbert Love.
-God.

347
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:51,862
-David.
-Who are you?

348
00:17:51,945 --> 00:17:53,280
I'm Cindy Featherbottom.

349
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:55,699
I've been looking for you.
Love's gone missing

350
00:17:55,783 --> 00:17:58,410
I've gotta find someone
to jump onto that stage

351
00:17:58,494 --> 00:18:02,498
and to show everyone here
that we're the party that has complete...

352
00:18:02,581 --> 00:18:04,708
con... complete... con.. con...

353
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:06,251
-Complete...
-"Trol"?

354
00:18:06,335 --> 00:18:07,795
Giant... "trol."

355
00:18:08,378 --> 00:18:10,839
<i>And that's when Lindsay</i>
<i>found an opportunity...</i>

356
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:11,924
I'll do it.

357
00:18:12,007 --> 00:18:14,176
<i>...to put a spin</i>
<i>on the looming photos scandal.</i>

358
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:16,804
I'm so sorry about that giant crack.

359
00:18:16,887 --> 00:18:20,724
Okay, raise the mics, everybody!
New speaker!

360
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:30,025
<i>Like many before her,</i>
<i>Lindsay would accuse Herbert Love...</i>

361
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:31,735
Can I have everyone's attention?

362
00:18:31,819 --> 00:18:33,112
<i>...of sexual harassment.</i>

363
00:18:33,987 --> 00:18:37,783
I am Herbert Love's key adviser.

364
00:18:38,534 --> 00:18:41,537
<i>But first she had</i>
<i>to turn his supporters against him.</i>

365
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:44,164
Listen, I have a few things
I'd like to tell you

366
00:18:44,248 --> 00:18:45,791
about Herbert Love.

367
00:18:45,874 --> 00:18:48,585
Love wants to put up a wall.

368
00:18:49,336 --> 00:18:52,756
No, no. I mean, not just any wall.

369
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:56,260
A wall to keep out the Mexicans.

370
00:18:57,803 --> 00:19:00,264
Well... Wow, what a great crowd.

371
00:19:00,764 --> 00:19:04,059
<i>And Maeby was waiting</i>
<i>to hear about her own efforts</i>

372
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:05,936
<i>to get even with Herbert Love.</i>

373
00:19:06,019 --> 00:19:08,981
-Hey, did you do it? Great.
-It's taken care of.

374
00:19:10,107 --> 00:19:12,901
But that's when the party
got out of control.

375
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:15,946
Thank God I'm with an undercover cop.
Pull out your gun.

376
00:19:16,029 --> 00:19:17,239
I don't have a gun.

377
00:19:17,322 --> 00:19:20,200
-What kind of cop doesn't have a gun?
-OK, I'm not a cop.

378
00:19:20,284 --> 00:19:22,286
But I saw your badge at the bar.

379
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:25,539
<i>In fact, it was an anti-bullying badge.</i>

380

<i>He'd received it from a police-run</i>
<i>anti-bullying program at school.</i>

381
00:19:29,877 --> 00:19:32,087
You're never too old
to stand up to a bully.

382
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:35,257
I made up all that stuff to impress you.
I'm just a senior.

383
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:38,135
-A <i>señor?</i>
-I'm 17.

384
00:19:40,762 --> 00:19:42,014
You're 17?

385
00:19:42,097 --> 00:19:43,140
Yeah.

386
00:19:43,932 --> 00:19:45,017
I'm 23.

387
00:19:45,601 --> 00:19:49,229
Oh, that's a relief.
I wasn't supposed to be driving with you.

388
00:19:49,479 --> 00:19:50,898
But we messed around.

389
00:19:50,981 --> 00:19:52,399
<i>Oh, they did more than that.</i>

390
00:19:54,318 --> 00:19:55,819
Don't worry, nobody saw.

391
00:19:55,903 --> 00:19:57,779
<i>Except Lucille Two...</i>

392
00:19:58,238 --> 00:19:59,740

<i>What's going on?</i>

402
00:20:27,476 --> 00:20:30,938
A bunch of young Mexicans
are taking over Cinco de Cuatro.

403
00:20:31,021 --> 00:20:32,731
They don't find it funny anymore.

404
00:20:32,814 --> 00:20:36,026
But that was my necklace. I mean... God!

405
00:20:37,194 --> 00:20:39,446
They don't belong here, we belong here.

406
00:20:42,449 --> 00:20:44,910
I mean, someone should put up a wall.

No, you're 17. I'm a 23-year-old woman.
