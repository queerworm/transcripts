[Ron Howard] <i>While attempting to bail out</i>
<i>his brother, Buster,</i>

2
00:00:17,434 --> 00:00:20,603
<i>Michael had accidentally bailed out</i>

3
00:00:20,687 --> 00:00:24,107
-What's it gonna cost to get Buster out?
<i>-</i>I don't know. What's he in for?

4
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:25,567
-Murder? Manslaughter?
-No. No.

5
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:26,609
There's no murder.

6
00:00:26,693 --> 00:00:29,195
He tampered with evidence
when Lucille 2 went missing.

7
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:32,157
-I would say over $50,000.
-[Michael] Mm-hmm.

8
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:34,117
Yeah, well, I told you, I'm tapped out.

9
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,494
Couldn't you embe--
borrow from your company?

10
00:00:36,578 --> 00:00:41,082
What are you talking about?
Lucille Austero is a majority shareholder.

11
00:00:41,166 --> 00:00:42,667
We're gonna be under scrutiny.

12
00:00:42,751 --> 00:00:46,296
Doesn't George Michael have a company
that he can em-- borrow from?

13
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:47,547
You need $15,000?

14
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:51,009
No. No, not at all.
No, please, son, not from you.

15
00:00:51,092 --> 00:00:53,094
I'd never ask you for money. Come on.

16
00:00:53,178 --> 00:00:54,971
And it's <i>50,000</i>

17
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:57,390
that I'm <i>not </i>asking you for, not 15, okay?

18
00:00:57,474 --> 00:00:59,434
Which I could probably lend you.

19
00:00:59,517 --> 00:01:02,103
-Oh, I don't need it.
-Huh? No? Good. Yeah?

20
00:01:02,187 --> 00:01:03,646
Good, good.

21
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:05,815
So your Fakeblock's doing well?

22
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:08,109
[Ron] <i>George Michael had been</i>

23
00:01:08,193 --> 00:01:10,153

24
00:01:10,236 --> 00:01:12,739
-Been meaning to ask.
<i>-...but this wasn't it.</i>

25
00:01:12,822 --> 00:01:15,825
Yeah, well, Fakeblock's money is
all tied up in legalities,

26
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:17,911
-patenting, marketing.
-Sounds amazing.

27
00:01:18,036 --> 00:01:20,163
Good for you, good for you. Good for him.

28
00:01:20,246 --> 00:01:21,915
We're trying to figure out
the Buster thing.

29
00:01:21,998 --> 00:01:25,668
Well, if we can't use the company money
to get Buster out,

30
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:28,004
you better figure out a way to do it,
Barry...

31
00:01:29,422 --> 00:01:30,924
or I'll use my own lawyer.

32
00:01:31,007 --> 00:01:33,510
What are you talking about,
another lawyer?

33
00:01:33,593 --> 00:01:35,804
You don't have the courtesy to wait
until I'm disbarred?

34
00:01:35,887 --> 00:01:38,640
Is this a divorce guy? Oh, this hurts.

35
00:01:38,723 --> 00:01:40,517
Give me a second, I'll be all right.

36
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:43,311
I was gonna use your divorce
to pay off my peekaboo lawyer.

37
00:01:43,394 --> 00:01:46,106
His name is Dustin Radler,
and I haven't hired him,

38
00:01:46,189 --> 00:01:48,942
because technically,
he's given up the rat race.

39
00:01:49,025 --> 00:01:51,152
Oh, God, the giving up the rat race guy?

40
00:01:51,236 --> 00:01:52,570
This is the sand hobo?

41
00:01:52,654 --> 00:01:54,030
Uh, it's just a question.

42
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:55,865
Are you guys doing something?

43
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:57,492
-[inhales]
-[Gob] Don't say it!

44
00:01:57,575 --> 00:02:00,537
Please, I can't... I can't hear it.

45
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:02,455
He tickles my fancy.

46
00:02:02,539 --> 00:02:04,582
Your what? Is the...

47
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:07,460
What part of Mom is the fancy?

48
00:02:07,544 --> 00:02:09,337
You do not want to know
what I'm picturing,

49
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:11,381
and it's not what you think.

50
00:02:11,464 --> 00:02:12,841
Oh, stop.

51
00:02:12,924 --> 00:02:14,217
We walk on the beach.

52
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:16,803
We like the feel
of the sand on our feet.

53
00:02:16,886 --> 00:02:19,013
Oh, God, the thought of your feet.

54
00:02:19,097 --> 00:02:20,306
[George Sr.] It's fine.

55
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:21,933
I'm glad you have someone to talk to.

56
00:02:22,016 --> 00:02:24,310
Well, maybe I'll go check on Buster.

57
00:02:24,394 --> 00:02:26,980
Wow.
Mom really has him fancy-whipped, huh?

58
00:02:27,063 --> 00:02:29,607
You don't want to bring another lawyer
into this.

59
00:02:29,691 --> 00:02:32,527
You don't want to go in fully armed,
because the DA,

60
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:34,863
she's up for reelection,
and she's a killer.

61
00:02:34,946 --> 00:02:36,573
God, I even hate to say her name.

62
00:02:36,656 --> 00:02:38,116
{\an8}[upbeat music playing]

00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:40,535
{\an8}Yeah, Lottie Dottie DA, my asshole.

64
00:02:40,618 --> 00:02:44,706
Okay. When it comes to Buster:
a total press blackout.

65
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:47,167
Couldn't agree more.
We have to be diligent.

66
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:48,668
-No media.
-[Tobias] Uh...

67
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:51,838
are we talking about reality or, uh,

68
00:02:51,921 --> 00:02:54,382
scripted, as well,
because [laughs] I've got...

69
00:02:54,465 --> 00:02:56,968
Why would there be a scripted
about the family?

70
00:02:57,051 --> 00:02:59,220
Weren't you working on one
with Ron Howard?

71
00:03:00,221 --> 00:03:01,139
[clicks tongue]

72
00:03:02,348 --> 00:03:04,142
You're saying
that's not grandfathered in.

73
00:03:05,518 --> 00:03:06,853
'Cause it was before the murder.

74
00:03:06,936 --> 00:03:08,438
Michael, tell me that movie

75
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:12,066
you were producing about us
is not still happening.

76
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:14,360
I do not think that it is. I mean, I...

77
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:17,906
I gave the releases to Kitty,
but the industry does not move fast.

78
00:03:17,989 --> 00:03:20,950
Well, then, talk to Kitty
and get them back.

79
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:22,535
-Can't. Kitty hates me.
-[Gob laughs]

80
00:03:23,536 --> 00:03:25,288
Did you catch this?

81
00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:27,123
Man, that's priceless.

82
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:29,042
First, you eat it with Buster,

83
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:31,127
then you step in it with the movie,

84
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:33,087
and now you're eating
what you stepped in,

85
00:03:33,171 --> 00:03:35,590
because Kitty hates you.

86
00:03:36,674 --> 00:03:39,344
Guess Michael's the geo-bead today.

87
00:03:40,011 --> 00:03:41,304
Did you say "geo-bead"?

88
00:03:41,387 --> 00:03:44,974
Yeah, it's one of Dad's expressions--
When somebody screws up, Dad said it.

89
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:47,518
One of his "you'll figure it out
someday" expressions.

90
00:03:47,602 --> 00:03:49,187
-Okay.
-Know what? You're lucky,

91
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:51,606
'cause Kitty's sweet on me,
so I'll go with you.

92
00:03:51,689 --> 00:03:54,442
-No, thank you. Nope.
-I could go. Or just...

93
00:03:54,525 --> 00:03:58,321
Would that be helpful if I did?
Or am I just being a G-O-B?

94
00:03:58,404 --> 00:03:59,656
-[chuckles]
-Uh... [scoffs]

95
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:01,783
G-O-B spells "Gob," you geo-bead,

96
00:04:01,866 --> 00:04:03,201
so why don't you s... ah.

97
00:04:04,327 --> 00:04:05,662
Well, today's the day.

98
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:08,706
Why are you even still here?
Go find your wife.

99
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:11,417
I don't know where she is.

100
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,586
Well, track down the ex-boyfriend.

101
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:15,255
And take Tonto with you.

102
00:04:15,338 --> 00:04:17,674
Yes, of course, Marky Bark.

103
00:04:18,007 --> 00:04:19,384
From the cuckolding.

104
00:04:19,467 --> 00:04:23,221
I think I might have an idea
of where I can, I think.

Why don't we make out again

113

I can't, 'cause my dad's here,

Wait, so you <i>are </i>still dating her?

118
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:55,670
What happened to our plan,

119
00:04:55,753 --> 00:04:57,422
where you show up demanding sex
after ghosting her

120
00:04:57,505 --> 00:04:58,798
for two months,
and she breaks up with you?

121
00:04:58,881 --> 00:05:01,634
Didn't I tell you?
She was out of town for two months,

122
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:04,137
and it looked like I was waiting
for her when she got home,

123
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:06,222
and she thinks
we're closer than ever now.

124
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:08,516
I've agreed to go to this barbecue

00:05:16,274 --> 00:05:19,152
Oh, did that actress die?
Oh, [bleeps] you, 2015.

129
00:05:19,235 --> 00:05:22,572
Oh, no, this is different.

130
00:05:22,655 --> 00:05:24,115
his name is Murphybrown,

131
00:05:24,198 --> 00:05:26,367
and it's more than just his acting friend.

132
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:27,744
It's his boyfriend.

133

No, it's his son.

Oh, I'm sorry, Maeby.

No, of course not.

-If anything, I'm... jealous.
-[Michael] Hmm.

140
00:05:41,507 --> 00:05:44,302
Yeah, that... that is a great word for it.

141
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:50,558
Did I overhear that Rebel
does not want you to meet her family?

142
00:05:50,641 --> 00:05:52,185
No, it's that they're having

143
00:05:52,268 --> 00:05:55,355
some barbecue thing today
over at her dad's house...

144
00:05:55,438 --> 00:05:57,398
And you were not invited. Ay, ay, ay.

145
00:05:57,482 --> 00:05:59,609
[stammering] No, I think I could show up.

146
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:01,819
-She didn't seem into it...
-Well,

147
00:06:01,903 --> 00:06:05,323
I'm the wrong one to ask.
When I was briefly interested

148
00:06:05,406 --> 00:06:06,991
in Rebel, you know,

149
00:06:07,075 --> 00:06:11,287
and even that overstates it,
I failed the Ron test big-time.

150
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:14,540
Okay? And in fairness to Ron,
I also thought that he was...

151
00:06:14,624 --> 00:06:15,833
Her...

152
00:06:17,168 --> 00:06:18,961
Her lover?

153
00:06:20,338 --> 00:06:21,464
...boss. [laughs softly]

154
00:06:21,547 --> 00:06:23,091
But listen, you take your time.

155
00:06:23,174 --> 00:06:25,551
Don't rush trying to fit in
with that crowd.

156
00:06:25,635 --> 00:06:28,179
They're probably looking for a yes-man
or a suck-up.

157
00:06:28,262 --> 00:06:29,597
That's not your style.

158
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:32,183
No. No, well, I had a great role model.

159
00:06:32,266 --> 00:06:33,393
Aw, bless you.

160
00:06:33,476 --> 00:06:35,228
Yeah, I also had a...

Well, bless you.

162

If you end up meeting that family,

163
00:06:39,565 --> 00:06:41,192
one good rule to follow is...

164
00:06:41,275 --> 00:06:42,902
-do not bring Tobias.
-Be myself.

165
00:06:42,985 --> 00:06:44,153
Be yourself, George Michael.

00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:55,081
{\an8}<i>who lost everything,</i>
<i>and the one son who had no choice</i>

170
00:06:55,164 --> 00:06:56,791
{\an8}<i>but to keep them all together.</i>

171
00:07:02,797 --> 00:07:04,507
{\an8}<i>It's </i>Arrested Development.

172
00:07:08,177 --> 00:07:11,055
[Ron] <i>Michael Bluth was taking his brother</i>
<i>to ensure</i>

173
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:13,933
<i>that Kitty wasn't going to make</i>
<i>a movie about Buster.</i>

174
00:07:14,016 --> 00:07:16,769
-...eating what you stepped in.
<i>-</i>You made that point.

175
00:07:16,853 --> 00:07:18,271
I had to give her Buster.

176
00:07:18,354 --> 00:07:19,897
{\an8}The movie couldn't be me
and George Michael.

177
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:21,524
{\an8}We were both dating Rebel,

178
00:07:21,607 --> 00:07:23,818
{\an8}and she didn't know
that he was my son.

179
00:07:23,901 --> 00:07:25,194
{\an8}-It was a disaster.
-Right.

180
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:28,489
{\an8}You didn't know who I was dating,
so you accused me of being the other man.

181
00:07:28,573 --> 00:07:30,950
{\an8}-Who were you dating?
-[laughing] Julie Bowen!

182
00:07:31,033 --> 00:07:33,286
{\an8}[Ron] <i>Actually, it was Tony Wonder,</i>

183
00:07:33,369 --> 00:07:36,038
{\an8}<i>a man Gob had been longing</i>
<i>to hear from ever since</i>

184
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:39,417
{\an8}<i>the gay magician poofed</i>
<i>into his life,</i>

185
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,711
{\an8}<i>-and then, just as quickly...</i>
-Oh, [bleeps].

186
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:42,753
{\an8}<i>...disa-poofed.</i>

187
00:07:42,837 --> 00:07:45,506
{\an8}[Michael] The Rebel thing
almost ruined my relationship with my son.

188
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:47,467
{\an8}And I think that it's a good thing

189
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:49,469
{\an8}she's lost interest in George Michael.

190
00:07:49,552 --> 00:07:52,180
{\an8}-I have to tell you...
-That never made sense.

191
00:07:52,263 --> 00:07:53,347
{\an8}It never made sense.

192
00:07:53,431 --> 00:07:55,433
{\an8}It never made sense,
because, you know,

193
00:07:55,516 --> 00:07:59,312
{\an8}he doesn't fit in with those people,
and I think that George Michael and I

194
00:07:59,395 --> 00:08:00,688
{\an8}are gonna be closer than ever.

195
00:08:00,771 --> 00:08:02,899
{\an8}He's gonna need a father--
still needs a father.

196
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:05,151
{\an8}The only mother figure he's ever had

197
00:08:05,234 --> 00:08:07,361
{\an8}-in his life was...
-Oh, it was Mom.

198
00:08:09,447 --> 00:08:10,948
{\an8}Yeah.<i> </i>Yeah, I guess so.

199
00:08:12,742 --> 00:08:14,035
{\an8}Huh, poor kid.

200
00:08:15,203 --> 00:08:16,829
{\an8}-I can't imagine.
-Nor can I.

201
00:08:23,628 --> 00:08:26,380
{\an8}-Wait, <i>we </i>had Mom.
-You know, in a way, she was <i>our </i>mom.

202
00:08:28,925 --> 00:08:31,469
{\an8}[Ron] <i>George Michael</i>
<i>was seeking motherly advice</i>

203
00:08:31,552 --> 00:08:33,137
<i>from a cousin</i>

204
00:08:33,221 --> 00:08:35,598
<i>-who'd been living as a grandma.</i>
-[Stan] Aha.

205
00:08:35,681 --> 00:08:38,267
I heard we're getting a visit
from the grandson. Want a lick?

206
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:40,770
-Oh, my God, no.
-Good, more for me.

207
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:43,606
-Gonna have more? I can come back.
-No, no. Come on in.

208
00:08:43,689 --> 00:08:45,942
I heard you're having
relationship trouble.

209
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:48,402
I'll go get your...
What do you call her? Gangie?

210
00:08:48,486 --> 00:08:49,403
Maeby...

211
00:08:49,862 --> 00:08:51,572
I <i>should </i>call her that.

212
00:08:51,656 --> 00:08:54,325
Uh, yeah, relationship problems.

213
00:08:54,492 --> 00:08:56,702
-Gangie gets it.
-Yeah, she sure helped me.

214
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:58,371
Imagine finding love at my age.

215
00:08:58,454 --> 00:09:00,248
It is hard to imagine, but, uh,

216
00:09:00,331 --> 00:09:02,458
maybe you'll find something else,
like a hobby

217
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:03,918
-or a napkin.
-Mm.

218
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:07,046
Annette, your grandson's here.

219
00:09:07,129 --> 00:09:08,673
[Maeby] I have no makeup on,

220
00:09:08,756 --> 00:09:10,800
-I'm a mess. Cover your eyes.
-Too late.

221
00:09:11,175 --> 00:09:12,843
I won't look.
If your grandson wasn't here,

222
00:09:12,927 --> 00:09:14,595
I'd probably take a peeky-weeky.

223
00:09:15,054 --> 00:09:18,182
[Maeby] Well, hey,
what a surprise... honey.

224
00:09:19,016 --> 00:09:20,977
[George Michael]
You're living with this guy?

225
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:24,689
Hey, my fake identity is none of
your fake identity's business, okay?

226
00:09:24,772 --> 00:09:26,607
[George Michael] Speaking of that,
things have gotten worse.

227
00:09:26,691 --> 00:09:29,860
Not only does my dad think Fakeblock
is real, and I've got money

228
00:09:29,944 --> 00:09:32,822
I won't share with him
when he needs to bail out Buster,

229
00:09:33,364 --> 00:09:36,033
but he also thinks I should
take things slower with Rebel.

230
00:09:36,158 --> 00:09:37,868
I don't know,
but here's my idea about her.

231
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:39,745
What do women really want?

232
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:41,414
Their fathers' attention.

233
00:09:41,497 --> 00:09:43,749
And Ron Howard is a buttoned-down guy,
right?

234
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:45,543
What if he doesn't like you?

235
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:48,129
What if you show up to the barbecue
with pink hair?

236
00:09:48,212 --> 00:09:49,338
-Pink hair?
-Yeah.

237
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:53,509
I saw it on someone recently,
and it made me want to puke. Trust me.

238
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:55,803
You are gonna be like, "Burn!" [laughs]

239
00:09:56,804 --> 00:09:58,097
That's starting to tingle.

240
00:09:58,180 --> 00:09:59,890
Let me know when it starts to burn.

241
00:09:59,974 --> 00:10:02,435
-It's gonna burn?
-Did I not make that clear?

242
00:10:02,935 --> 00:10:05,938
Nobody said getting out of a relationship
would be painless.

243
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:08,441
You should talk about
getting out of a relationship.

244
00:10:08,524 --> 00:10:11,402
I think your friend Stan
might be interested in you

245
00:10:11,485 --> 00:10:13,779
in a way that you don't want him
to be interested.

246
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:16,574
That would explain
why he's offering to do my laundry.

247
00:10:17,158 --> 00:10:20,494
Well, whatever gets him to do my laundry,
huh? [chuckles]

248
00:10:20,578 --> 00:10:22,955
Yeah, no, I'll suss it out.

249
00:10:23,164 --> 00:10:25,916
This lie I'm living might be
sending him mixed signals.

250
00:10:26,751 --> 00:10:28,919
[Ron] <i>At that moment,</i>
<i>some mixed signals</i>

251
00:10:29,003 --> 00:10:31,255
<i>were also being sent</i>
<i>on Pacific Coast Highway...</i>

252
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:34,008
{\an8}Technically,
they had to call me Rock Monster.

253
00:10:34,091 --> 00:10:36,677
[Ron] <i>...as Tobias</i>
<i>and his newly found son</i>

254
00:10:36,761 --> 00:10:39,430
<i>were headed to Mexico</i>
<i>to find his newly lost wife.</i>

255
00:10:39,513 --> 00:10:41,098
And John Beard actually said

256
00:10:41,182 --> 00:10:43,559
I was one of the more popular predators,

257
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:45,978
so whatever gets your name
and weight out there.

258
00:10:46,062 --> 00:10:48,022
But I want to hear about <i>your </i>dreams.

259
00:10:48,105 --> 00:10:50,941
I don't know.
I'm really good at computers.

260
00:10:51,025 --> 00:10:51,859
It's fun, too.

261
00:10:51,942 --> 00:10:53,903
Kind of like the only time I feel alive.

262
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:55,321
No, no, your dreams,

263
00:10:55,404 --> 00:10:58,407
not what you think will make you rich.
Your passion.

264
00:10:58,491 --> 00:11:01,535
Oh, also maybe being,
like, a doctor for animals,

265
00:11:01,619 --> 00:11:04,288
or their dogs, 'cause sometimes,
if I look at an animal,

266
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:06,582
there's, like, a special connection.

267
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:08,334
Dreams! Dreams.

268
00:11:08,417 --> 00:11:11,337
I didn't ask,
"What part of a dog do you want to touch?"

269
00:11:11,712 --> 00:11:15,007
Okay, let's try this in reverse.
Uh, you're famous.

270
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:17,802
Uh, what is the thing you do
that makes everyone clap?

271
00:11:19,261 --> 00:11:22,181
Ooh! Once I got claps
for doing a juggling ball thing,

272
00:11:22,431 --> 00:11:25,393
'cause I'd unicycle
in Haiti when I was volunteering...

273
00:11:25,476 --> 00:11:28,270
Yes! Clowning, yes!
Now, you're dreaming.

274
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:30,064
That's your dream.

275
00:11:30,147 --> 00:11:33,401
Well, perhaps we should juggle
your priorities. [chuckles]

276
00:11:33,484 --> 00:11:34,318
Oh.

277
00:11:35,778 --> 00:11:38,072
[Ron] <i>And Michael</i>
<i>was preparing his brother</i>

278
00:11:38,155 --> 00:11:41,242
<i>to persuade Kitty to give back</i>
<i>their movie rights.</i>

279
00:11:41,325 --> 00:11:43,077
Good. Here comes Kitty.
Here she comes.

280
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,829
-I believe in you. You can do her.
-What?

281
00:11:44,912 --> 00:11:47,915
<i>This. </i>You can do this...
[chuckles] <i>to </i>her.

282
00:11:47,998 --> 00:11:51,502
Michael! Whatever it is, the answer is no,
unless you want the answer to be no,

283
00:11:51,585 --> 00:11:54,964
-and then, it is yes.
-Well, Gob, I want you to,

284
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:57,508
-uh, to see who's here.
-Gob.

285
00:11:58,509 --> 00:12:01,262
Well, aren't you a sight for sore eyes.
[chuckles]

286
00:12:01,345 --> 00:12:03,681
I was gonna say, they look puffy and red.

287
00:12:03,764 --> 00:12:05,766
[laughs shrilly]

288
00:12:07,518 --> 00:12:09,812
-You guys need to get a room, huh?
-[Kitty] Right?

289
00:12:09,895 --> 00:12:11,355
Why don't you guys get a room,

290
00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:13,357
and I can say hi to Ron?
What do you think?

291
00:12:13,441 --> 00:12:17,236
He's not in the office today.
He has some family event.

292
00:12:17,319 --> 00:12:19,905
-Oh, is that today?
-But since he's not here,

293
00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:21,782
how would you like
to get inside of a LEM?

294
00:12:21,866 --> 00:12:23,242
If I could j-- Um, Michael.

295
00:12:23,325 --> 00:12:24,869
-I just...
-[Michael] Yeah?

296
00:12:24,952 --> 00:12:26,746
-I can't do this.
-No. You're gonna be fine.

297
00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:29,039
You're gonna be fine.
You were built for this, okay?

298
00:12:29,123 --> 00:12:30,791
[Gob] I can see she's got gum
in her mouth.

299
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:33,544
-[Michael] She can hear you.
-[overlapping chatter]

300
00:12:33,627 --> 00:12:36,130
[Kitty] You're overthinking it.
Nothing to worry about.

301
00:12:36,213 --> 00:12:39,425
-It was in the past. You've been there.
-Let me get out of your hair.

302
00:12:39,508 --> 00:12:41,093
-And you can get in my hair.
-God, no.

303
00:12:41,177 --> 00:12:42,595
You can't make me touch her hair.

304
00:12:42,678 --> 00:12:45,181
-I'm not gonna touch her hair.
-Come on, Gob.

305
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:49,477
[Ron] <i>And nearby,</i>
<i>George Maharis was ready to alienate</i>

306
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:52,396
<i>his soon to be ex-girlfriend's family</i>

307
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:56,066
<i>with a head full of Tobias Pink hair.</i>

308
00:12:57,568 --> 00:12:59,487
[Rebel] Hey!<i> </i>There you are.

309
00:13:00,321 --> 00:13:02,364
Dad, this is George Maharis.

310
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:05,075
-Oh, neat to meet you.
-Neat to meet you.

311
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:06,786
[Ron] Rebel says neat things about you.

312
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:09,580
What's up?

313
00:13:09,663 --> 00:13:12,750
[Ron] <i>Unfortunately,</i>
<i>Maeby left the dye in too long,</i>

314
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:14,460
<i>-and it turned out to be...</i>
-[Ron] Look.

315
00:13:14,543 --> 00:13:15,920
Howard Red.

316
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:18,964
No, it isn't. It... It's...

317
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:21,801
[chuckles]

318
00:13:21,884 --> 00:13:24,220
-Imagine if it was pink, though.
-[Ron] Yeah, but it's not.

319
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:27,139
It's Howard Red.
Cheryl, look at what this kid did.

320
00:13:27,223 --> 00:13:28,766
[Cheryl] It's like our hair.

321
00:13:29,433 --> 00:13:30,935
Someone's come a-courtin'.

322
00:13:31,685 --> 00:13:33,395
You're fitting in already.

323
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:35,981
[all laughing]

324
00:13:37,566 --> 00:13:39,819
-What's so funny?
-Oh, it's just my family.

325
00:13:39,944 --> 00:13:42,279
We Howards don't just laugh
when things are funny.

326
00:13:42,363 --> 00:13:43,531
We laugh when we're happy.

327
00:13:44,114 --> 00:13:45,908
And when things are uncomfortable, too.

328
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:48,327
You mean, when bad reviews
start rolling in?

329
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:52,164
[all laughing]

330
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:55,793
[Ron] So, Rebel tells me

331
00:13:55,876 --> 00:13:59,338
that you're an entrepreneur,
some sort of security software?

332
00:13:59,421 --> 00:14:03,217
Oh, Dad, it's called Fakeblock,
and it's amazing.

333
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:05,719
The company's gonna go under
by next week. We're broke.

334
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:09,223
Guess I'm not exactly
daddy's dream boyfriend, am I?

335
00:14:09,932 --> 00:14:12,226
Listen, don't worry
about that company stuff.

336
00:14:12,309 --> 00:14:15,271
-When I started Imagine...
-[Ron] <i>With Brian Grazer.</i>

337
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:17,982
...the company was up to its neck in debt,
but look at me...

338
00:14:18,065 --> 00:14:19,692
-[Ron] <i>And Brian.</i>
-...now.

339
00:14:19,775 --> 00:14:22,611
And in those early days, I can't tell you

340
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:25,614
how many times I felt like a fraud.

341
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:29,952
But I'll tell you a secret,
everyone feels that way.

342
00:14:30,035 --> 00:14:32,997
[Ron] <i>George Michael was touched</i>
<i>by the advice...</i>

343
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:35,791
But enough business talk.
Tell me, do you like hot dogs?

344
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:38,043
[Ron]
<i>...but he made one last attempt</i>

345
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:39,879
<i>to offend his host...</i>

346
00:14:39,962 --> 00:14:42,298
-No, I don't like hot dogs.
-[all laughing]

347
00:14:42,423 --> 00:14:43,799
[laughs nervously]

348
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:48,012
-[Ron] <i>...but couldn't.</i>
-I love them.

349
00:14:48,095 --> 00:14:50,431
[all laughing loudly]

350
00:14:52,099 --> 00:14:54,977
-[laughing] No.
-Oh, my God.

351
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:57,187
[Ron] You're good. You're good.

352
00:14:57,271 --> 00:14:58,898
[all continue laughing]

353
00:15:02,276 --> 00:15:04,945
[Ron chuckling] <i>What a neat group.</i>

354
00:15:05,613 --> 00:15:08,908
<i>Meanwhile, Gob was trying</i>
<i>to get in the mood with Kitty.</i>

355
00:15:09,658 --> 00:15:11,911
[Gob] Hard to believe
they used to put monkeys in these.

356
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:13,454
[Kitty giggles]

357
00:15:13,537 --> 00:15:14,747
My guess?

358
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:17,249
They wouldn't be able
to figure out a lot of this stuff.

359
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:19,376
Yeah. Monkeys are kind of dumb.

360
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:22,046
I'd like to see one get out of here
quickly in an emergency.

361
00:15:22,129 --> 00:15:23,255
[both chuckle]

362
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:24,423
They'd be all...

363
00:15:24,506 --> 00:15:26,508
[imitating a monkey]
I have to get out of here.

364
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:28,761
[imitating a monkey]
Get me out of here. [laughs]

365
00:15:28,844 --> 00:15:32,431
[in normal voice] Ah, too good,
too good, too good.

366
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:35,434
[in normal voice] So...

367
00:15:35,517 --> 00:15:37,394
surely you didn't want
to be alone with me

368
00:15:37,478 --> 00:15:39,605
to talk about monkeys in space.

369
00:15:39,688 --> 00:15:43,734
No. I did not want to be alone
with you at all.

370
00:15:43,817 --> 00:15:45,986
[chuckles]

371
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:48,322
[slurps]

372
00:15:48,405 --> 00:15:50,532
Remind me not to forget my gum.

373
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:54,036
-[ringtone playing]
-One sec. Probably my brother.

374
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:57,706
-"Did you trick her into it yet?"
-"Trick her into what?"

375
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:59,541
"Giving us our rights back, you geo..."

376
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:02,836
It's Tony. I gotta take this.
Can I get some privacy?

377
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,588
-We're sealed in here.
-I gotta get out.

378
00:16:04,672 --> 00:16:06,382
-You can't turn that...
-Get me out of here.

379
00:16:06,465 --> 00:16:07,967
-No, no!
-It'll go to voicemail!

380
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:09,218
I gotta blow the hatch!

381
00:16:09,301 --> 00:16:11,845
-[Kitty] That's the chute!
-God, I just...

382
00:16:13,722 --> 00:16:15,182
'mazing Jesus.

383
00:16:15,557 --> 00:16:17,393
[Tony] <i>Hey, it's Tony.</i>

384
00:16:17,851 --> 00:16:19,061
Oh. [chuckles]

385
00:16:19,561 --> 00:16:22,606
-If I'd known, I wouldn't have picked up.
-[Tony chuckles]

386
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:25,651
-I think that we're stuck in here.
-[sighs]

387
00:16:25,734 --> 00:16:28,112
-[Tony] Where are you?
-[Gob] <i>Oh, um...</i>

388
00:16:28,195 --> 00:16:30,406
I'm in a LEM. Where are you?

389
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:33,283
[Tony] I'm in a Tumi... suitcase.

390
00:16:33,367 --> 00:16:35,703
I think I'm in baggage claim
at Long Beach Airport.

391
00:16:35,786 --> 00:16:37,079
My assistant's picking me up,

392
00:16:37,162 --> 00:16:39,248
unless she takes
another gray Tumi by mistake,

393
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:40,791
then I go to unclaimed.

394
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:45,295
<i>-That's how we lost the Amazing Frederick.</i>
-I would've claimed you. [chuckles]

395
00:16:45,379 --> 00:16:47,423
[Tony chuckles] I'll bet.

396
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:49,591
[chuckles, sighs]

397
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:50,884
[Tony chuckles]

398
00:16:54,722 --> 00:16:57,057
Since I'm getting back in town,
I thought I owed you a call.

399
00:16:57,141 --> 00:16:58,475
<i>So, let's get together.</i>

400
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:01,395
-I can't right now. I've got this thing...
-[clangs]

401
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:03,480
...I'm stuck in the LEM with.

402
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:04,940
<i>That's the other thing.</i>

403
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:07,943
I don't think we can actually hang out,
anyway.

404
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:10,821
I mean,
I'm the flamboyant gay magician.

405
00:17:10,904 --> 00:17:13,073
<i>You're the super straight</i>
<i>Christian magician.</i>

406
00:17:13,157 --> 00:17:14,867
<i>We'll taint each other's brand.</i>

407
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:17,036
Yeah.<i> </i>[sighs]

408
00:17:17,745 --> 00:17:21,999
I guess we're...
different in the same way.

409
00:17:22,082 --> 00:17:24,626
[Tony] Same, in a different way.

410
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:25,919
-Different...
-[Tony] Same...

411
00:17:26,003 --> 00:17:28,630
-...in a same, different way.
-[Tony] ...in a different way, same.

412
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:31,008
-Different, wifferent...
-[Tony] Same way.

413
00:17:31,091 --> 00:17:33,010
-...in a same gay way?
-[Tony] Different same.

414
00:17:33,093 --> 00:17:34,470
-It...
-[Tony] Wame.

415
00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:36,472
Wow. Guess that's over.

416
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:38,640
[Tony] Yup. Talk about a sign.

417
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:40,559
[Ron] <i>And that's when they realized</i>

418
00:17:40,642 --> 00:17:42,728
<i>there was a time</i>
<i>when they could speak in unison,</i>

419
00:17:42,811 --> 00:17:44,438
<i>but I guess it was over now.</i>

420
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:47,524
[Tony] I gotta run.
I better shut up and listen for "wonder."

421
00:17:47,608 --> 00:17:49,276
[Gob] <i>Wait, so is this goodbye--</i>

422
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:50,903
[phone line clicks]

423
00:17:56,575 --> 00:17:58,035
How much did you hear?

424
00:17:59,286 --> 00:18:01,914
[Ron] <i>And George Sr.</i>
<i>visited his prison alma mater</i>

425
00:18:01,997 --> 00:18:04,208
<i>for the first time</i>
<i>since his son had been incarcerated.</i>

426
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:06,919
This is where I ate a battery
during my first week at recess.

427
00:18:07,002 --> 00:18:09,630
No, no, "yard." Don't call it recess.

428
00:18:09,713 --> 00:18:11,840
Well, it's a little too late for that,
Dad.

429
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:14,218
I've been trying to figure out prison
on my own.

430
00:18:14,301 --> 00:18:16,678
-I know. Sorry...
-[Duck] George Bluth! Oh, my God.

431
00:18:17,304 --> 00:18:19,640
-I've never seen you in street clothes.
-[George Sr.] Duck?

432
00:18:19,723 --> 00:18:23,018
I almost didn't recognize you
without the flashlight in your mouth.

433
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:24,144
[both laugh]

434
00:18:24,228 --> 00:18:25,687
[Buster laughing]

435
00:18:27,189 --> 00:18:29,108
Sorry to be rude.
This is my son, Buster.

436
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:30,734
Charmed, I'm...

437
00:18:30,818 --> 00:18:32,569
[Duck and George Sr.] No touching.

438
00:18:33,654 --> 00:18:35,989
[Ron] <i>And perhaps</i>
<i>that was why George Sr.</i>

439
00:18:36,073 --> 00:18:38,158
<i>decided he owed it to his son</i>

440
00:18:38,242 --> 00:18:40,369
<i>to share some</i>
<i>of his own caged wisdom.</i>

441
00:18:40,452 --> 00:18:42,955
[George Sr.] Buster,
you have to toughen up now.

442
00:18:43,038 --> 00:18:45,290
You're in lock-up, all right?
They'll circle like jackals.

443
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:48,001
You gotta be strong,
especially with the skinheads.

444
00:18:48,085 --> 00:18:50,337
Skinhead gets in your face,
you charge back at him.

445
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:51,338
You pop him fast.

446
00:18:51,421 --> 00:18:53,674
That's the only way you can get respect.

447
00:18:53,757 --> 00:18:56,218
[Buster] That one there's
been giving me looks.

448
00:18:56,301 --> 00:18:57,886
[George Sr.] No. That's not a skinhead.

449
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:00,430
That's a guard.
You charge at a guard, they'll kill you.

450
00:19:00,514 --> 00:19:02,641
Oh, yeah. That I should know.

451
00:19:02,724 --> 00:19:05,269
But with a skinhead,
that's how you get respect.

452
00:19:05,352 --> 00:19:08,230
I got more respect then,
with these animals,

453
00:19:08,313 --> 00:19:11,150
than I get with your...
with your mother now.

454
00:19:11,608 --> 00:19:15,154
-I can't...
-[acoustic guitar playing]

455
00:19:15,237 --> 00:19:17,239
I can't satisfy her.

456
00:19:17,322 --> 00:19:19,491
-Really? It's so easy.
-No, I mean,

457
00:19:19,575 --> 00:19:21,660
we are no longer together.
Your mother kicked me out.

458
00:19:22,244 --> 00:19:24,204
-Oh, there's an opening.
-No, no, no.

459
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:26,748
No, she doesn't want anything
to do with either of us.

460
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:29,459
She has found someone new.
She's found a younger man.

461
00:19:29,543 --> 00:19:30,878
-Yeah.
-Oh.

462
00:19:30,961 --> 00:19:32,421
Sort of a son with benefits.

463
00:19:32,504 --> 00:19:35,174
They said that I'd lose my old lady,

464
00:19:35,883 --> 00:19:37,217
and I said, "Not mother!"

465
00:19:37,301 --> 00:19:38,552
-Okay.
-"She'll wait for me!"

466
00:19:38,635 --> 00:19:40,012
-Shh.
-[sobbing]

467
00:19:40,095 --> 00:19:42,306
The thought of her
singing to him goodnight.

468

[both sobbing]

469
00:19:47,561 --> 00:19:50,314
I can't take it. I can't take it.

470
00:19:50,397 --> 00:19:53,192
I know. I know.

471
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:54,776
No touching.

472
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:56,320
[Ron] <i>And that's when George Sr.</i>

473
00:19:56,403 --> 00:19:58,614
<i>decided to have someone else</i>

-I know.

00:20:01,658 --> 00:20:02,784
What are you gonna do?

477
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:04,453
[George Sr.] I know what I have to do.

478
00:20:04,536 --> 00:20:06,747
-[Buster] Oh... are you...
-I'm sorry.

Jesus Christ, George.

481
00:20:14,171 --> 00:20:16,715
I was so mad when I thought
you didn't recognize me.

-It's been his job since he was two.
-Huh.

488
00:20:30,646 --> 00:20:33,482
[Rebel] Sometimes, you want to look
in your parents' perfect,

-sweet, kind faces, and tell them off.
-Punch them.

Why would you say that?

No, no, I... That...

492
00:20:38,862 --> 00:20:41,073
I don't feel that way,
but certain kids do.

00:20:41,156 --> 00:20:42,282
There's a website about it.

494
00:20:42,366 --> 00:20:45,494
Although, everyone knows
it's biased in favor of the dads.

495
00:20:45,577 --> 00:20:48,080
-Your company should shut that site down.
-Well...

496
00:20:48,163 --> 00:20:51,083
[Ron] <i>And George Michael,</i>
<i>finding himself smitten</i>

497
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:54,670
<i>with Rebel and her family,</i>
<i>decided to come clean...</i>

498
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:57,839
To be honest, I don't know
if there's gonna be a company.

499
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:01,468
[Ron] <i>...until she said this.</i>

500
00:21:01,551 --> 00:21:03,053
Is it a money thing?

501
00:21:03,136 --> 00:21:05,097
If you need money,
I can loan it to you.

502
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:07,391
Everybody needs a bailout now and then.

503
00:21:07,474 --> 00:21:09,434
It'll give me a stake in the company.

504
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:13,188
[Ron] <i>And the prospect of</i>
<i>helping his family...</i>

505
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:16,441
Well, speaking of family,
I actually could use a little...

506
00:21:16,525 --> 00:21:18,110
[Ron] <i>...proved too great</i>
<i>a temptation.</i>

507
00:21:18,193 --> 00:21:19,861
...bailout money, as you put it.

508
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:21,947
-Are you sure?
-Yes!

509
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:24,616
Oh, my God, You are great.
Why don't we talk about it tomorrow?

510
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:27,119
Ah, I can't do it tomorrow.
I've got reshoots.

511
00:21:27,202 --> 00:21:28,370
All the Mexico stuff.

512
00:21:28,453 --> 00:21:30,789
And so you know,
my ex-boyfriend will be there.

513
00:21:30,872 --> 00:21:33,417
But if I know you're gonna be here
when I get back...

514
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:34,376
Then when you're back.

515
00:21:34,459 --> 00:21:36,169
Yes! [chuckles]

516
00:21:36,253 --> 00:21:37,963
Wait. What color's your hair gonna be?

517
00:21:38,046 --> 00:21:40,465
It's like kissing your cousin. Ugh.

518
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:42,426
Ew. Okay. Gross, okay. Got it.

519
00:21:43,218 --> 00:21:44,469
[chuckles nervously]

520
00:21:44,553 --> 00:21:48,640
[Ron] <i>Meanwhile, Maeby was concerned</i>
<i>that Stan's strange behavior was romantic,</i>

521
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:50,225
<i>so she tried to discourage it.</i>

522
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:53,729
Maybe I'm trying to prove
something to my clueless dad.

523
00:21:54,354 --> 00:21:58,567
Anyway, I guess that's why
I can't make a relationship work.

524
00:21:59,443 --> 00:22:00,402
Does that upset you?

525
00:22:00,485 --> 00:22:02,863
Annette, it does,
if you must know the truth,

526
00:22:03,071 --> 00:22:04,448
'cause your dad was a fool.

527
00:22:04,531 --> 00:22:07,743
I see the real you: a special,
wonderful, unique,

528
00:22:07,826 --> 00:22:10,412
67-year-old woman
who amazes me every day.

529
00:22:10,495 --> 00:22:13,206
[Ron] <i>And that's when Maeby realized</i>
<i>what it was about</i>

530
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:15,459
<i>Stan's behavior that was so confusing.</i>

531
00:22:16,043 --> 00:22:17,836
It would be my pleasure
to be the man in your life

532
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:19,755
that your father never was.

533
00:22:19,838 --> 00:22:22,591
[Ron] <i>It was paternal, and, touched,</i>

534
00:22:22,674 --> 00:22:24,801
<i>all she could think of to say was...</i>

535
00:22:24,885 --> 00:22:26,762
-Bury me.
<i>-</i>[both laughing]

536
00:22:27,512 --> 00:22:29,306
[Ron] <i>And Maeby's actual father,</i>

537
00:22:29,389 --> 00:22:31,683
<i>and his newfound son, Murphybrown,</i>

538
00:22:31,767 --> 00:22:34,686
<i>arrived at the last place</i>
<i>he'd seen Lindsay:</i>

539
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:36,772
<i>Father B's now-abandoned property.</i>

540
00:22:36,855 --> 00:22:38,982
Keep an eye out for Lindsay.
That is why we're here.

541
00:22:40,317 --> 00:22:42,277
Wait, is that her? Is that Lindsay?

542
00:22:42,361 --> 00:22:44,488
Oh, yes. Lindsay!

543
00:22:44,571 --> 00:22:46,698
It's us! It's us! Hi!

544
00:22:47,366 --> 00:22:50,535
Oh, no. That's a sickly cactus
with a plastic bag on it.

545
00:22:50,619 --> 00:22:52,871
Right. For a second,
I was like, "Is that Lindsay?"

546
00:22:52,954 --> 00:22:54,373
[Tobias] I suppose it's true.

547
00:22:54,456 --> 00:22:55,916
The desert makes one see

548
00:22:55,999 --> 00:22:59,503
-what one wants to see. [chuckles]
-Hmm. Yeah.

549
00:22:59,586 --> 00:23:01,088
Is that two barrel-chested,

550
00:23:01,171 --> 00:23:03,507
strapping men
on horseback approaching us?

551
00:23:06,259 --> 00:23:08,553
[man] You are not welcome
on this land.

552
00:23:08,637 --> 00:23:10,013
There must be some mistake.

553
00:23:10,097 --> 00:23:12,057
No, there is no mistake.

554
00:23:12,682 --> 00:23:15,685
I regret to inform you
that you are trespassing.

555
00:23:15,769 --> 00:23:18,605
Mm... no, this land belongs
to George Bluth.

556
00:23:19,064 --> 00:23:20,649
[man] Oh. I see.

557
00:23:20,732 --> 00:23:23,402
-And are you George Bluth?
-[chuckles] N...

558
00:23:23,485 --> 00:23:26,571
[Ron] <i>It was a part</i>
<i>that Tobias had played before.</i>

559
00:23:26,655 --> 00:23:29,908
You are about to witness why
a career in entertainment

560
00:23:29,991 --> 00:23:30,992
can come in handy.

561
00:23:33,203 --> 00:23:34,996
[imitating George Sr.] Yeah, that's right.

562
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:39,668
I'm the last guy you want to kick off
of your la-- his land-- my land.

563
00:23:39,751 --> 00:23:40,710
-Our land.
-No.

564
00:23:40,794 --> 00:23:44,423
[man] Oh, I did not realize
you were Mr. George Bluth himself.

565
00:23:44,881 --> 00:23:48,260
Well, Mr. George Bluth,
we have some papers for you to sign.

566
00:23:48,343 --> 00:23:50,011
Oh, is that right?

567
00:23:50,095 --> 00:23:51,638
Well, how about I just...

568
00:23:51,721 --> 00:23:54,349
use my son Michael
as a signing surface?

569
00:23:54,474 --> 00:23:55,600
-Get up.
-[Murphybrown] Okay.

570
00:23:55,684 --> 00:23:58,353
[Ron] <i>Tobias wasn't the only</i>
<i>one trespassing</i>

571
00:23:58,437 --> 00:24:00,522
<i>on someone else's property,</i>
<i>as Michael had decided</i>

572
00:24:00,605 --> 00:24:03,358
<i>to do what he was certain</i>
<i>Gob couldn't:</i>

573
00:24:03,442 --> 00:24:05,402
<i>take matters into his own hands.</i>

574
00:24:05,485 --> 00:24:09,614
I can't tell you how many times
I've felt like a fraud.

575
00:24:10,031 --> 00:24:12,284
But I'll tell you a secret, everyone--

576
00:24:12,367 --> 00:24:14,286
Hey, Ron. Michael.

577
00:24:14,369 --> 00:24:16,872
From that untitled Bluth project.

578
00:24:16,955 --> 00:24:19,166
-Then I dated Rebel.
-Oh, oh. Yeah, yeah.

579
00:24:19,249 --> 00:24:20,083
Prayer hands.

580
00:24:20,667 --> 00:24:24,087
Yeah. Listen, a lot of stuff has changed
with the family.

581
00:24:24,171 --> 00:24:26,006
Yeah. I heard about that.

582
00:24:26,089 --> 00:24:27,549
Oh, has it gotten out?

583
00:24:27,966 --> 00:24:29,509
[Ron] Not to the general public,

584
00:24:29,593 --> 00:24:31,428
but at Imagine, we hear everything.

585
00:24:31,511 --> 00:24:33,138
[Gob] <i>You know I'm as straight</i>

586
00:24:33,221 --> 00:24:35,891
as they come, I just got a lot
on my mind right now

587
00:24:35,974 --> 00:24:38,935
with work, slash, am I gay,
slash, Buster's in jail.

588
00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:41,229
-He is? What for?
-[Gob] Well, just for...

589
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:44,649
for maybe killing this woman
my family owes money to.

590
00:24:44,733 --> 00:24:46,067
I think it was his robot hand.

591
00:24:46,151 --> 00:24:47,861
-Get me Ron.
-[Gob] It's hush-hush.

592
00:24:47,944 --> 00:24:50,447
Okay, so then you might understand why

593
00:24:50,530 --> 00:24:52,115
we don't want a movie about it.

594
00:24:52,199 --> 00:24:54,409
[Ron] Absolutely.
You'd have to cut too much.

595
00:24:54,493 --> 00:24:58,371
This has true crime limited series
written all over it.

596
00:24:58,455 --> 00:25:00,540
That way, my Rebel could be in it, too.

597
00:25:00,624 --> 00:25:02,792
She's no Bryce, but she's like a robot.

598
00:25:03,126 --> 00:25:06,796
Gives the exact same performance
every take. Real time-saver.

599
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,798
So, yes, let's do this.

600
00:25:08,882 --> 00:25:12,344
Here's the thing. Right now,
my family is not looking for publicity.

601
00:25:12,427 --> 00:25:15,180
The other way to look at it is
if I heard about it,

602
00:25:15,263 --> 00:25:16,431
it's out there.

603
00:25:16,515 --> 00:25:18,642
Best way to manage press
is to get in front of it.

604
00:25:18,725 --> 00:25:21,895
Hey, Dad. We need you
for the three-legged race.

605
00:25:21,978 --> 00:25:24,981
-Also, can you start the music?
-I don't know how to, Reed.

606
00:25:25,357 --> 00:25:28,401
Oh. I must've heard that.
I must've heard that.

607
00:25:28,485 --> 00:25:30,570
Right? Sure. That, uh... so you get...

608
00:25:30,654 --> 00:25:33,823
-Do you get the scripts read to you?
-[Ron] Uh...

609
00:25:34,491 --> 00:25:36,576
This is my son, Reed.

610
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:37,869
My dad knows how to read.

611
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:40,330
Yes.

612
00:25:41,206 --> 00:25:43,375
Nice to meet you.
Uh, yeah. Whenever.

613
00:25:44,042 --> 00:25:46,169
[Michael] I see why
you named him Reed.

614
00:25:46,253 --> 00:25:47,254
He seems smart.

615
00:25:48,797 --> 00:25:50,465
Hey, thanks for sneaking in.

616
00:25:52,133 --> 00:25:53,093
Yep.

617
00:25:53,176 --> 00:25:56,763
[Ron] <i>As he rushed to get out</i>
<i>before running into Rebel,</i>

618
00:25:56,846 --> 00:25:59,808
<i>Michael ran into yet another</i>
<i>famous Howard.</i>

619
00:25:59,891 --> 00:26:01,101
-Hi.
-Hi.

620
00:26:01,184 --> 00:26:03,061
Avoiding the three-legged race,
I see.

621
00:26:03,144 --> 00:26:04,229
-[chuckles]
-[Reed] Bryce!

622
00:26:04,312 --> 00:26:06,481
I'm sorry, but I just can't, Reed.

623
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:09,985
[Michael] Oh,
talking to your brother Reed. I get it.

624
00:26:10,068 --> 00:26:11,278
Michael Bluth. Pleasure.

625
00:26:11,361 --> 00:26:12,904
-Hi. Bryce.
-Yeah, no. I know.

626
00:26:12,988 --> 00:26:16,366
Oh, yes. Yes, you dated my sister,
didn't you?

627
00:26:16,449 --> 00:26:18,034
Well, even that overstates it.

628
00:26:18,118 --> 00:26:20,829
We weren't together long
before we broke up.

629
00:26:20,912 --> 00:26:23,081
-You know, very clean break.
-[Bryce] Oh.

630
00:26:23,164 --> 00:26:26,001
[Michael] I was gonna say hi,
but I ain't not going somewhere.

631
00:26:26,084 --> 00:26:28,003
But I-I'm going somewhere.
Never mind.

632
00:26:28,086 --> 00:26:31,006
Listen, you dodged a bullet.
She's a user.

633
00:26:31,089 --> 00:26:33,425
She's got a new guy.
And she's using him.

634
00:26:33,508 --> 00:26:35,802
[Michael] Yeah?
But I heard that's ending.

635
00:26:35,885 --> 00:26:37,887
No, are you kidding? He's trapped.

636
00:26:37,971 --> 00:26:39,472
-Hmm.
-[Bryce] In her web.

637
00:26:39,556 --> 00:26:41,975
She's with him
because of his Internet company.

638
00:26:42,058 --> 00:26:43,018
You know that, right?

639
00:26:44,311 --> 00:26:47,147
You think so?
Do you think that she's just using him?

640
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:50,483
Yeah. And I'm pretty sure
it's not for his body.

641
00:26:51,234 --> 00:26:53,653
Oh, well... I mean, I don't know the guy,

642
00:26:53,737 --> 00:26:54,738
but I saw a picture.

643
00:26:54,821 --> 00:26:57,949
I think he's got a great build.
You know? Um, he's wiry.

644
00:26:58,033 --> 00:26:59,576
You wouldn't want him to be taller.

645
00:26:59,659 --> 00:27:02,662
I like the young man's body.
Okay? I do.

646
00:27:02,746 --> 00:27:05,957
[chuckles] Yeah, well,
that's very weird of you.

647
00:27:06,041 --> 00:27:07,792
Still, such a kiss-up.

648
00:27:07,876 --> 00:27:09,919
He's even dyed his hair
Dallas Howard Red.

649
00:27:10,003 --> 00:27:11,546
-I get it. It's a hot new dye,
-New dye?

650
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:13,757
but you're not supposed
to leave it in that long.

651
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:16,885
Look at him. Ugh.
He looks like aÂ jack-o'-lantern.

652
00:27:16,968 --> 00:27:19,971
-[Rebel] Put your head down.
-[George Michael laughs] What...

653
00:27:20,597 --> 00:27:21,681
[Bryce laughs]

654
00:27:21,765 --> 00:27:23,600
-Dork.
-[Michael] Can I exit through the house?

655
00:27:23,683 --> 00:27:25,935
I don't want the user
to create a dramatic scene.

656
00:27:26,019 --> 00:27:27,687
No. Don't worry about that.

657
00:27:27,771 --> 00:27:31,358
[laughing] I have seen her get laughs
doing <i>The Glass Menagerie.</i>

658
00:27:31,441 --> 00:27:33,068
[chuckles]

659
00:27:33,151 --> 00:27:34,819
[Michael] Oh. I don't get it.

660
00:27:35,236 --> 00:27:37,489
[Ron] <i>Michael was hoping</i>
<i>to avoid an awkward run-in</i>

661
00:27:37,572 --> 00:27:39,324
<i>with his son at the valet,</i>

662
00:27:39,407 --> 00:27:42,661
<i>when he came across a way</i>
<i>to find out</i> <i>when the coast was clear.</i>

663
00:27:42,744 --> 00:27:44,454
-Hi.
-Can I help you?

664
00:27:44,537 --> 00:27:46,289
Yeah, that's a sweet setup there.

665
00:27:46,373 --> 00:27:48,124
I wanted to take a peek.
Do you mind?

666
00:27:48,208 --> 00:27:49,751
I want to check out my son.

667
00:27:49,834 --> 00:27:51,378
[man] Uh, that I understand.

668
00:27:51,628 --> 00:27:54,089
My name is Rance Howard,
Ron's dad.

669
00:27:55,924 --> 00:27:57,258
I thought you worked here. Hi.

670
00:27:57,342 --> 00:28:00,553
Well, I like to stay busy,
keep an eye on my son, too.

671
00:28:00,637 --> 00:28:02,847
Oh, yeah? You still have to do that?

672
00:28:02,931 --> 00:28:05,684
That's a father's job.
Doesn't start at 9:00 and end at 5:00.

673
00:28:05,767 --> 00:28:08,561
It's 24 hours a day, seven days a week.

674
00:28:08,645 --> 00:28:09,771
Even as they get older, huh?

675
00:28:09,854 --> 00:28:12,482
It gets even harder,
'cause they think they know it all.

676
00:28:12,565 --> 00:28:15,735
You still have to be there for them
when they make mistakes.

677
00:28:15,819 --> 00:28:18,571
Or sometimes they need
to cry a little bit

678
00:28:18,655 --> 00:28:21,825
because sometimes a person needs
to cry a little bit.

679
00:28:22,283 --> 00:28:24,828
Unless that person is a dad.

680
00:28:25,495 --> 00:28:27,872
For a father must
bear his load lightly,

681
00:28:27,956 --> 00:28:32,836
and yet, beneath the mask,
a watchful eye never wanders.

682
00:28:33,169 --> 00:28:35,588
For it is through this glance

683
00:28:36,047 --> 00:28:39,843
that a wisdom beyond words
must be passed.

684
00:28:40,343 --> 00:28:41,469
That's an interesting take.

685
00:28:41,553 --> 00:28:44,097
Because I think a girl
might be using my son,

686
00:28:44,222 --> 00:28:47,350
but I don't exactly have a way
to keep an eye on her...

687
00:28:48,977 --> 00:28:50,603
[Ron] Oh, I see you met my dad.

688
00:28:50,687 --> 00:28:53,189
He doesn't say much,
but we're sure glad he's around.

689
00:28:53,273 --> 00:28:55,400
Although,
hopefully he didn't share his thoughts

690
00:28:55,483 --> 00:28:56,943
about climate change, did he?

691
00:28:57,026 --> 00:28:59,571
-Hoax!
-[Michael] He was great company.

692
00:28:59,654 --> 00:29:03,074
[Ron] <i>That's when Michael found a way</i>
<i>to keep an eye on the woman</i>

693
00:29:03,158 --> 00:29:04,659
<i>who might be using his son.</i>

694
00:29:04,743 --> 00:29:06,494
Know what else is a good company?

695
00:29:06,578 --> 00:29:07,912
Imagine Entertainment.

696
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:12,000
And I think that I want to go forward
with that docuseries after all.

697
00:29:12,083 --> 00:29:14,878
That's great news. Hey, Jocelyn!

698
00:29:14,961 --> 00:29:18,006
Would you mind bringing down
the standard TV contracts, please?

699
00:29:18,089 --> 00:29:20,216
[Jocelyn] Streaming contracts,
cable or broadcast?

700
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:21,801
-A streamer!
-[Jocelyn] No residuals.

701
00:29:21,885 --> 00:29:24,220
Jocey will have those down
in just a minute,

702
00:29:24,304 --> 00:29:26,848
and if we're quick, we can get
an interview with your brother

703
00:29:26,931 --> 00:29:28,349
while he's still in jail.

704
00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:30,143
You know, you can't beat
those visuals.

705
00:29:30,226 --> 00:29:32,312
Put a little atmosphere
in there, you filter it...

706
00:29:32,395 --> 00:29:35,690
Nice low-angle shot for the close-up...

707
00:29:38,401 --> 00:29:41,780
Oh, a wide shot.
Tell it in one image.

708
00:29:42,906 --> 00:29:44,365
[Ron] <i>Yes, a wide shot.</i>

709
00:29:45,325 --> 00:29:46,409
Wide shot.

710
00:29:47,368 --> 00:29:48,953
[Ron] <i>Michael returned home...</i>

711
00:29:49,871 --> 00:29:51,498
How did it go with Gob and Kitty?

712
00:29:51,581 --> 00:29:53,750
[Ron] <i>...where his mother</i>
<i>had been lying in wait.</i>

713
00:29:53,833 --> 00:29:55,835
Tell me he got her to kill the movie.

714
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:58,880
[stammers] Well,
I think he probably forgot to ask.

715
00:29:58,963 --> 00:30:00,715
That's okay 'cause I spoke to Ron.

716
00:30:01,382 --> 00:30:03,551
He was very happy to see me.
It felt good.

717
00:30:03,635 --> 00:30:06,012
[scoffs] That's just Hollywood BS.

718
00:30:06,095 --> 00:30:07,764
Well, I think it's gonna help us.

719
00:30:07,847 --> 00:30:09,808
You think what is going to help us?

720
00:30:09,891 --> 00:30:11,142
Oh, God. I'm burying the lead.

721
00:30:11,226 --> 00:30:13,978
The Bluth project is dead because...

722
00:30:14,687 --> 00:30:16,606
it's gonna be a streaming series.

723
00:30:16,689 --> 00:30:20,109
We said no leaks,
and now we're streaming over everyone?

724
00:30:20,193 --> 00:30:22,153
I'm not telling it well. The point is,

725
00:30:22,237 --> 00:30:23,905
Ron's gonna do
an introductory interview,

726
00:30:23,988 --> 00:30:26,574
okay, with Buster, as research

727
00:30:26,658 --> 00:30:28,618
about the family's history,
and what...

728
00:30:28,701 --> 00:30:31,204
Michael, they cannot go
into our family's past.

729
00:30:31,287 --> 00:30:33,581
They certainly can't do
a TV show about it.

730
00:30:33,665 --> 00:30:35,208
It's never gonna get that far.

731
00:30:35,291 --> 00:30:37,377
It's gonna send a signal to the DA

732
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:39,838
that if they hold Buster,
they're looking for trouble.

733
00:30:39,921 --> 00:30:40,755
Think about it.

734
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:42,048
If the nicest man in the world

735
00:30:42,131 --> 00:30:43,758
goes in there with his camera
and crew,

736
00:30:43,842 --> 00:30:45,802
and he tells Buster
he believes in his innocence...

737
00:30:45,885 --> 00:30:48,346
They'll drop the charges
quicker than you can blink your...

738
00:30:49,639 --> 00:30:52,058
Initiate, at least,
the blinking of the eyes.

739
00:30:52,141 --> 00:30:53,476
The opening of the eyes is, uh,

740
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:55,603
a bit of a guestimate lately.

741
00:30:55,687 --> 00:30:57,438
And what if Buster chokes?

742
00:30:58,147 --> 00:30:59,899
I guess that's what Ron's for.

743
00:30:59,983 --> 00:31:02,402
[Ron] <i>That would prove</i>
<i>to be a very...</i>

744
00:31:02,485 --> 00:31:05,113
<i>No, you'll see on the next</i>
<i>"On the Next."</i>

745
00:31:05,196 --> 00:31:07,574
{\an8}<i>On the next </i>Arrested Development...

746
00:31:07,657 --> 00:31:11,995
On the next shot,
I know we said close-ups. No, wide.

747
00:31:12,078 --> 00:31:13,580
[Ron] <i>...Ron Howard arranges</i>

748
00:31:13,663 --> 00:31:16,207

749

Here we go.

750
00:31:19,168 --> 00:31:20,086
Showtime.

751
00:31:20,169 --> 00:31:23,006
<i>...and Buster remembers</i>
<i>George Sr.'s advice.</i>

752
00:31:23,089 --> 00:31:23,923
A skinhead.

753

I'm gonna kill you,
you bleeping skinhead!

754
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,512
-[guard] Oh, hey!
-[Ron choking]

755
00:31:29,596 --> 00:31:31,347
-Skinhead!
-[Ron groans]

756
00:31:31,764 --> 00:31:33,474
See what I did to skinhead?

757
00:31:33,558 --> 00:31:35,560
Mm. Make a note.

758
00:31:36,102 --> 00:31:37,645
[Ron] Forget the wide shots.

759
00:31:37,729 --> 00:31:40,023
50/50 and matching overs.

760
00:31:40,356 --> 00:31:43,526
[Ron] <i>And Maeby enjoys her</i>
<i>new paternal relationship.</i>

761
00:31:43,985 --> 00:31:46,029
Look how happy they look together.

762
00:31:46,821 --> 00:31:47,780
Just like us.

763
00:31:50,283 --> 00:31:52,035
[Ron] <i>Until this happens.</i>

764
00:31:56,372 --> 00:31:59,292
[sighs] Okay, so I did have it
right the first time.
