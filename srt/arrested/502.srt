00:00:11,594 --> 00:00:13,930
[Ron Howard] <i>Michael had decided</i>
<i>to leave town,</i>

2
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:16,975
<i>and needed to get out of</i>
<i>his obligation to make a movie</i>

3
00:00:17,058 --> 00:00:19,436
<i>-about his family.</i>
-Michael! You had one job.

4
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:22,355
You had to get your son
to sign the releases!

5
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:25,108
Ron Howard wants to make
a heartfelt father-son drama

6
00:00:25,191 --> 00:00:28,194
that has a good clean message
for his illegitimate daughter to star in.

7
00:00:28,278 --> 00:00:29,988
Don't pull this on me!
We've already reserved

8
00:00:30,071 --> 00:00:32,198
the soundstages
and he's already started paying off

9
00:00:32,282 --> 00:00:34,409
-the Hollywood Foreign Press.
-[Ron] <i>No, they're great.</i>

10
00:00:34,492 --> 00:00:36,161
<i>-She's funny.</i>
-I understand all of that.

11
00:00:36,244 --> 00:00:39,247
Okay, but Rebel is part of
the reason why I can't do this.

12
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:41,332
My son is dating her,
and I don't want to get

13
00:00:41,416 --> 00:00:42,917
in the way. If I could talk to Ron,

14
00:00:43,001 --> 00:00:44,794
-No. No. I am in charge
-I'm sure he and I...

15
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:46,838
of this movie right now.
My ass is on the line

16
00:00:46,921 --> 00:00:49,174
while Ron makes a real movie in Mexico.

17
00:00:49,257 --> 00:00:51,134
-Mexico, okay.
-You don't understand

18
00:00:51,217 --> 00:00:52,844
how hard it is in Hollywood right now.

19
00:00:52,927 --> 00:00:54,429
You have to crank out family dramas

20
00:00:54,512 --> 00:00:57,098
before they let you make
your dream superhero movie.

21
00:00:57,182 --> 00:00:59,100
Do you have a dream superhero movie?

22
00:00:59,184 --> 00:01:01,519
I want to remake <i>Spider-Man 2,</i>
the first one.

23
00:01:02,103 --> 00:01:04,064
Or something that at least has a hook.

24
00:01:04,647 --> 00:01:07,817
-...little girl! [screams]
-Oh, God! Damn it.

25
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:10,028
My brother Buster has something
better than a hook.

26
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:13,782
A robot hand. Okay?
And there's a cop looking for him.

27
00:01:13,865 --> 00:01:15,992
-Hmm.
-And they can't find Lucille 2.

28
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:18,161
And I found Buster in the attic
in scuba gear.

29
00:01:18,244 --> 00:01:20,121
It's intriguing.
I think that's your movie.

30
00:01:20,205 --> 00:01:21,664
-That's your guy.
-No.

31
00:01:21,748 --> 00:01:23,625
Okay, I've got his release right here.

32
00:01:23,708 --> 00:01:26,086
[Ron] <i>In fact,</i>
<i>it was the only family member's release...</i>

33
00:01:26,544 --> 00:01:28,546
You're out of the movie.
You're out of the movie.

34
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:30,340
<i>-...he hadn't destroyed.</i>
-You're out of the movie.

35
00:01:30,423 --> 00:01:32,217
You're out of the movie!
Know what?

36
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:33,676
-You're out of the movie.
-Fine.

37
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,095
Hey, Dad, how ya doing?

38
00:01:35,637 --> 00:01:38,056
-You're out of the movie!
-[Michael] <i>With Buster,</i>

39
00:01:38,139 --> 00:01:40,767
it is not father-son,
it's more mother-son.

40
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:43,728
But if you could get Rebel
to play Lucille, you know...

41
00:01:43,812 --> 00:01:45,230
If she could go that unlikable.

42
00:01:45,313 --> 00:01:46,815
So that's his release right here.

43
00:01:47,357 --> 00:01:49,400
These are the other releases.
You need tape,

44
00:01:49,484 --> 00:01:51,027
but they're pretty clean.

45
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:54,405
You're off the picture, Michael.
I'll give you your 500 bucks.

46
00:01:55,281 --> 00:01:57,325
-I get paid?
-They're Imagine dollars.

47
00:01:57,408 --> 00:01:58,993
They're redeemable in the gift shop.

48
00:01:59,077 --> 00:02:01,246
-That's Ron Howard.
-Brian's on the 50.

49
00:02:01,329 --> 00:02:04,207
It's a severance thing they're doing
because of Ron's need to be loved

50
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:05,917
and Brian's conflict avoidance issues.

51
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,254
[Ron] <i>Michael had gotten into something</i>
<i>he wanted no part of.</i>

52
00:02:09,337 --> 00:02:11,131
I'm sure they've got
a very old relationship.

53
00:02:11,214 --> 00:02:12,632
I could tell you stories.

54
00:02:12,715 --> 00:02:15,718
[Ron] <i>But she wouldn't dare.</i>
<i>And after a quick stop downstairs...</i>

55
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:17,303
I think I'm gonna take

56
00:02:17,387 --> 00:02:19,180
one <i>Gung Ho </i>kimono, okay?

57
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:21,558
Oh, and maybe a Brian wig. That's fun.

58
00:02:21,641 --> 00:02:23,893
-Oh, we only sell these as a set.
-[line ringing]

59
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:25,395
They were getting very competitive.

60
00:02:25,478 --> 00:02:27,063
-Were they?
-[whispers] Brian was.

61
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:28,481
<i>...and another call to his son...</i>

62
00:02:28,565 --> 00:02:30,358
[George Michael]
<i>You've reached George Maharis.</i>

63
00:02:30,441 --> 00:02:32,735
[in normal voice]
Did you want that Rebel Alley hair?

64
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:34,070
Oh. Uh, no no.

65
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:35,738
That's... that is mine.

66
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:37,991
-I came with that. Uh, okay.
<i>-...Michael headed home</i>

67
00:02:38,074 --> 00:02:41,703
<i>to tell Buster his plan</i>
<i>for making the family come back.</i>

68
00:02:41,786 --> 00:02:44,581
I've sent away the fumigator,
and all you got to do,

69
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:46,416
so we can declare you missing,

70
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:48,459
is stay out of sight for about 72 hours.

71
00:02:48,543 --> 00:02:50,086
-Milford style.
-Hmm?

72
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:52,005
-I'm a Milford man, Michael.
-Yeah?

73
00:02:52,088 --> 00:02:54,799
Winner of 1982's Least Seen on Campus.

74
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:58,678
I wish I could've seen their faces

75
00:02:58,761 --> 00:02:59,971
-at the ceremony.
-We just,

76
00:03:00,054 --> 00:03:02,348
you know, we gotta play this right
and, uh,

77
00:03:02,432 --> 00:03:03,975
you gotta make sure you don't...

78
00:03:04,893 --> 00:03:07,896
-well, show your hand.
-This is one of only two things

79
00:03:07,979 --> 00:03:10,481
the Army warns us about
when they issue these.

80
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:13,067
Boy, Kitty does not know
what she's sitting on.

81
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:16,237
Pal, I'm gonna call you from,
uh, wherever I end up,

82
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:18,406
and you're gonna be great.

83
00:03:18,489 --> 00:03:21,492
I-I just don't understand why
I can't go with you, Michael.

84
00:03:21,576 --> 00:03:23,328
It's about teaching them a lesson.

85
00:03:23,411 --> 00:03:24,746
-Mm-hmm.
-So... And I just,

86
00:03:24,829 --> 00:03:26,789
I got in a big fight with my son,
you know.

87
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:28,458
It was my fault. For so many years,

88
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:29,918
I was his mom and dad, so...

89
00:03:30,793 --> 00:03:33,254
Maybe that's a role
I can play in your life.

90
00:03:33,338 --> 00:03:34,339
[stammers] Don't say--

91
00:03:34,422 --> 00:03:36,174
Mom. Mmm.

92
00:03:38,009 --> 00:03:39,552
I thoughtÂ you were gonna say Dad.

93
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:41,012
-Mm-mm.
-But, you know,

94
00:03:41,095 --> 00:03:43,389
it's a bummer
that you can't come with me, Buster,

95
00:03:43,473 --> 00:03:45,141
but you need to stay and talk to the cops.

96
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:46,351
[Buster] Cops? What cops?

97
00:03:46,976 --> 00:03:50,021
-Why would you bring the cops into this?
-They're already looking for you.

98
00:03:50,104 --> 00:03:52,273
What? The cops are looking for me?

99
00:03:52,357 --> 00:03:54,525
<i>-A </i>cop, actually.
-I can't be talking to the cops.

100
00:03:54,609 --> 00:03:56,694
-Listen.
-I don't do good with the cops.

101
00:03:56,778 --> 00:03:58,238
I didn't do anything.
I don't know what's going on.

102
00:03:58,321 --> 00:04:00,573
-Relax.
-I ain't got no truck with no blue.

103
00:04:00,657 --> 00:04:01,783
Nothing to worry about.

104
00:04:01,866 --> 00:04:04,077
They're looking for Lucille Austero.
They want to question you.

105
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:07,872
Why would I know anything about Lucille 2?
I hope you didn't say we were dating.

106
00:04:07,956 --> 00:04:11,084
Uh, well, I mean, you...
you did live with her.

107
00:04:11,167 --> 00:04:14,587
Well, I lived with Mother.
Did you think we were dating? [chuckles]

108
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:17,632
-Question's been asked.
-[whimpers]

109
00:04:17,715 --> 00:04:19,968
-Do you actually know where Lucille 2 is?
-No!

110
00:04:20,051 --> 00:04:22,428
No! A thousand times, no!

111
00:04:23,012 --> 00:04:24,013
Is that what they'll ask?

112
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:26,015
'Cause it's not like I'm gonna
remember details

113
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:27,934
about where I saw her
and what we fought about.

114
00:04:28,017 --> 00:04:29,102
Oh, you fought?

115
00:04:29,185 --> 00:04:31,396
You kept me from Mother?

116
00:04:31,479 --> 00:04:33,690
You sent her to prison?

117
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:36,234
[growls]

118
00:04:36,317 --> 00:04:37,777
Should I not say that?

119
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:40,989
-I'm not good with the cops.
-Right.

120
00:04:41,072 --> 00:04:43,866
What if Lucille 2 doesn't come back?

121
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:47,287
Don't worry about that.
She-- I just spoke to her today.

122
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:50,039
-What? In person?
-Yeah. Uh, no.

123
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:51,165
On the phone. She's fine.

124
00:04:51,249 --> 00:04:53,418
Well, you could've told me that
from the beginning.

125
00:04:53,501 --> 00:04:55,795
This is not about Lucille 2.
This is about teaching Mom

126
00:04:55,878 --> 00:04:57,005
-a lesson, you know.
-Oh.

127
00:04:57,088 --> 00:04:58,589
I mean, she just splits town

128
00:04:58,673 --> 00:05:00,925
and assumes
I'm gonna take care of everything?

129
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:02,719
You know, this is just a way to, uh...

130
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:04,721
-Give Mom a little scare.
-Yeah.

131
00:05:04,804 --> 00:05:08,308
Yeah. Let them race back into town
and save everyone for a change.

132
00:05:08,391 --> 00:05:09,684
There's nothing to worry about.

133
00:05:09,767 --> 00:05:12,645
Just Mama's worst nightmare.
Buster's missing.

134
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:15,523
Oh, and his bath has gone cold. [laughs]

135

[Ron] <i>Buster was on board.</i>

136
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:20,194
Maybe have a full psych panel
while you're in there, too.

137
00:05:20,278 --> 00:05:22,113

-Hopi Indians believe that this spot...

165
00:06:41,317 --> 00:06:42,527
-Okay.
-...when manipulated,

166
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:44,278
can create sexual feeling.

167
00:06:44,362 --> 00:06:46,239
-That's my penis.
-You don't have to tell me.

168
00:06:46,322 --> 00:06:47,907
[Ron] <i>Which sent him into his crisis...</i>

169
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:49,951
[doctor] I can get hard,

170

<i>...of masculinity.</i>

171
00:06:51,369 --> 00:06:53,704
Hey, these are from the ladies
across the bar.

172
00:06:53,788 --> 00:06:55,957
-They're <i>primas.</i>
-[George Sr.] <i>Primos, </i>huh?

173
00:06:57,333 --> 00:06:59,252
I've gotta be honest, I've seen better.

174
00:06:59,335 --> 00:07:00,962
Huh? Eh.

175
00:07:01,045 --> 00:07:02,213
{\an8}No, it means cousins.

176
00:07:02,713 --> 00:07:05,383
{\an8}One hates her father,
and the other hates her grandfather.

177
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:08,261
{\an8}[Ron] <i>It seemed the cervezas</i>

178
00:07:08,344 --> 00:07:11,222
{\an8}<i>weren't the only thing being handed</i>

179
00:07:12,723 --> 00:07:15,268
{\an8}I don't know about you,
but I'd prefer the thrill of the hunt,

180
00:07:15,351 --> 00:07:16,978
{\an8}-as opposed to...
-[George Sr.] If we wait,

181
00:07:17,061 --> 00:07:19,647
{\an8}something a little better will come along.

182
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:20,898
{\an8}Thank you.

183
00:07:20,982 --> 00:07:22,859
{\an8}Not trying to fall
head over heels here.

184
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:24,360
{\an8}Yeah. Yeah.

185
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:26,404
{\an8}Not super eager to be, uh,
missing somebody.

186
00:07:26,487 --> 00:07:29,615
{\an8}-Yeah.
-[chuckles] I mean, who you love.

187
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:36,372
{\an8}-Place gives me the creeps. Let's get out.
-Yeah. It's dead.

188
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:39,125
{\an8}[Ron] <i>But back in America,</i>
<i>Michael was working on a way</i>

189

{\an8}<i>to make his runaway family return.</i>

190
00:07:42,003 --> 00:07:45,173
So, we gotta wait about 48 hours
before we declare you missing,

191
00:07:45,256 --> 00:07:47,008
-and then they put out an APB.
-APB.

192
00:07:47,091 --> 00:07:48,509
"Aw, poor Buster."

193
00:07:48,593 --> 00:07:49,635
-That's nice.
-Well...

194
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:52,346
You gotta lay low long enough
for Mom and Dad to hear about it.

195
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:54,724
And, pal, I would take you with me,
but truth is, I just,

196
00:07:54,807 --> 00:07:56,642
I don't know if I'm gonna come back.

197
00:08:02,231 --> 00:08:04,650
Oh. [chuckling]

198
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:06,110
What's so funny?

199
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:10,656
You always come back to save the family.
We joke about that all the time.

200
00:08:11,365 --> 00:08:14,994
Well, I don't know what the joke is.
I've been trying to do the right thing.

201
00:08:15,077 --> 00:08:17,663
[laughs] "Hi, I'm Michael,

202
00:08:17,747 --> 00:08:21,083
and I save everyone so I feel special,
even though you don't deserve it.

203
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:22,627
I'm leaving. I won't be coming back."

204

-Buster...
-"Oh!

205
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:25,713
Look who's back.

206
00:08:25,796 --> 00:08:28,508
I thought we were supposed to go [bleeps]
with a [bleeps]."

207
00:08:28,591 --> 00:08:31,052
"Mmm, you would know, Mother.
You practically invented

208
00:08:31,135 --> 00:08:34,055
[bleeps] [bleeps] when you get sauced!"
[gasps]

209

00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:42,730
I can't believe I pushed you
out of my [bleeps],

212
00:08:42,813 --> 00:08:45,024

213
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:48,319
-[inhales deeply]
-Covered a lot of ground there.

214
00:08:48,402 --> 00:08:49,278
Yeah.

215
00:08:49,445 --> 00:08:51,405
Although I'm glad
I won't be leaving you alone.

216
00:08:52,323 --> 00:08:53,407
Oh, I'm going with you?

217
00:08:53,491 --> 00:08:55,535
No, I'm going to Mexico or something,

218
00:08:55,618 --> 00:08:57,537
and you gotta go to the police station.

219
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:59,914
-Oh, right. Why do they arrest me?
-They don't.

220
00:08:59,997 --> 00:09:01,666
You go to the police station
'cause you say,

221
00:09:01,749 --> 00:09:03,501
"Heard you were looking for me.
Here I am."

222
00:09:03,584 --> 00:09:05,503
Oh, but you said a cop had questions
for me.

223
00:09:05,586 --> 00:09:06,671
Mm-hmm. About Lucille 2.

224
00:09:06,754 --> 00:09:08,714
And I'm not gonna answer
any questions, right?

225
00:09:08,798 --> 00:09:10,967
-No. Answer the questions.
-When Barry says it's okay.

226
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:13,261
Barry's not there. No attorneys.
Just tell the truth.

227
00:09:13,344 --> 00:09:15,346
Okay, like, bad example,

228
00:09:15,429 --> 00:09:19,100
I saw Lucille 2's lifeless body
sprawled across the stair car?

229
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:26,274
Perfect.
If that's what happened, tell them.

230
00:09:26,357 --> 00:09:28,025
Nothing to be nervous about, okay?

231
00:09:28,109 --> 00:09:29,860
Lucille 2 is probably gonna be back

232
00:09:29,944 --> 00:09:31,237
from whatever bender she's on.

233
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,406
She's gonna be as dry as, uh...

234
00:09:33,489 --> 00:09:35,032
well, Lucille 1.

235
00:09:35,116 --> 00:09:36,617
I can hear Mother winking now.

236
00:09:36,701 --> 00:09:39,620
So, I got some groceries.
These are gonna have to last.

237
00:09:39,704 --> 00:09:41,998
You already got into the candy bears, huh?

238
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:43,874
[Buster] This is literally one of only

239
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:46,711
two things the Army warns about
when they issue these.

240
00:09:46,794 --> 00:09:48,087
-Let me help.
-I think they spent

241
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:50,590
$27 million on the wrong guy.

242
00:09:50,673 --> 00:09:52,717
Don't you say that about you. Well...

243
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,428
Maybe you do say that.
Maybe that's important to say.

244
00:09:55,511 --> 00:09:58,139
[Ron] <i>And certain</i>
<i>his mother would have to return</i>

-[phone vibrates]
-Ooh.

249
00:10:12,028 --> 00:10:13,404
Hey, I am outside your door.

250
00:10:13,487 --> 00:10:15,489
I was this close to telling you.
You inside?

251
00:10:15,573 --> 00:10:17,908
[Lucille 2] <i>Hi, it's Lucille Austero.</i>

252
00:10:17,992 --> 00:10:19,410
-No!
<i>-I've been looking for you.</i>

253
00:10:20,036 --> 00:10:21,495
-Note, I mean.
-[Lucille 2 chattering]

254
00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:23,414
I know, I'd left you a note,

255
00:10:23,497 --> 00:10:26,292
-and, can you hear me?
-[Lucille 2 continues chattering]

256
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:29,378
Hello? Hello? Here we go again.

257
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:30,713
Getting disconnected.

258
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:33,966
This is why you always... leave a note.

259
00:10:34,842 --> 00:10:36,260
Always leave a note.

260
00:10:36,886 --> 00:10:38,054
Where's that from?

261
00:10:38,554 --> 00:10:41,641
[Ron] <i>Michael discovered</i>
<i>a note he'd already written.</i>

262
00:10:41,724 --> 00:10:43,517
[Michael] "Are you avoiding me? Ha ha.

263
00:10:43,601 --> 00:10:45,478
Leaving town for a while. Love you.

264
00:10:45,561 --> 00:10:47,063
-Michael Bluth."
-[Ron] <i>It worked well.</i>

265
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:55,279
<i>But perhaps if Michael</i>
<i>had taken a few seconds</i>

266
00:10:55,363 --> 00:10:57,907
<i>to write an original note</i>
<i>before leaving town,</i>

267
00:10:58,824 --> 00:11:02,453
<i>he would've run into George Michael,</i>
<i>who was coming to see him...</i>

268
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,999
<i>only to come across a cousin</i>
<i>he didn't recognize.</i>

269
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:09,835
-Hey. Know if anyone's home?
-[Steve] Uh, yeah, Buster's in there.

270
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:12,588
But if you're looking for Michael,
you just missed him.

271
00:11:14,048 --> 00:11:16,175
-[sighs]
-Oh, so much for apologizing.

272
00:11:16,258 --> 00:11:18,094
I'm telling you, he's moved on.

273
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:20,930
-Okay? You should, too.
-[Steve] I just found out

274
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:22,598
my dad went to Mexico without telling me.

275
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:24,767
[chuckles] Welcome
to the shitty parents club.

276
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:26,602
-No, no, we don't have kids.
-No.

277
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:28,229
[Ron] <i>Although there was a kid</i>

278
00:11:28,312 --> 00:11:30,398
<i>that Maeby was eager to get away from.</i>

279
00:11:30,481 --> 00:11:33,192
You know,
Mexico sounds far from Perfecto.

280
00:11:33,275 --> 00:11:35,778
So that's perfect.
What do you say? Screw it!

281
00:11:35,861 --> 00:11:37,405
No rules. Anything goes.

282
00:11:37,488 --> 00:11:40,950
[Ron] <i>A rebounding George Michael</i>
<i>found the offer intriguing.</i>

283
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:42,952
-Just the cousins.
-Mm-hmm.

284
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:44,370
[Ron] <i>Which turned out to be...</i>

285
00:11:44,453 --> 00:11:47,123
<i>-Primos! </i>[laughs]
<i>-...this crew.</i>

286
00:11:48,082 --> 00:11:50,251
-Why do you keep yelling that?
-[laughing] Stop it.

287
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:52,545
Ah.

288
00:11:55,256 --> 00:11:58,259
[Ron] <i>Not far away,</i>
<i>Michael was also heading to Mexico.</i>

289

290
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:03,848
[Michael] <i>It's Buster Bluth, that's right.</i>

291
00:12:03,931 --> 00:12:06,642
<i>Uh, yeah, I'm completely sure</i>
<i>he's been gone 72 hours.</i>

292
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:08,436
<i>As a matter of fact,</i>
<i>his bath has grown cold.</i>

293
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:11,021
<i>So that's, uh, an alarm bell right there.</i>

294
00:12:11,105 --> 00:12:12,732
[Ron] <i>...Michael was ready</i>
<i>to hit bottom</i>

295
00:12:12,815 --> 00:12:14,900
<i>-and go off the map.</i>
-[Michael] <i>Thanks so much.</i>

296
00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:16,694
[Ron] <i>But that's hard to do</i>

297
00:12:16,777 --> 00:12:19,113
<i>when you're driving a car</i>
<i>that makes maps.</i>

298
00:12:19,196 --> 00:12:20,656
[Michael] No pictures, thank you!

299
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,491
Put your phones down.
We take the pictures.

300
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:25,286
[Ron] <i>When the fleet</i>

-No! Window up.

-Window...
-Hi, I'm Dave from Mapping.

305
00:12:35,713 --> 00:12:37,673

-And that's Jeff.
-I'm Jeff from Earth.

307
00:12:41,093 --> 00:12:43,429
-Hi. Hi, guys.
-[Dave] We heard we had a runaway ostrich,

308
00:12:43,512 --> 00:12:45,556
and, uh, we need you to return the car.

309
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:48,517
Oh, yeah. Sorry. Am I under arrest?

310
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:50,853
Oh, no. They never arrest the drivers.

311
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:52,730
They do come down pretty hard
on the cars,

312
00:12:52,813 --> 00:12:55,065
but it's cheaper to just retrain
the people instead.

313
00:12:55,149 --> 00:12:58,110
It sounds super futuristic and dystopian,
but it's really not.

[Ron] <i>Earth was right.</i>

-Well, there's nothing we can say.

327
00:13:29,058 --> 00:13:31,685
I wouldn't blame you if you took off
and you don't come back.

328
00:13:32,102 --> 00:13:33,020
Nah.

-You are not welcome here.

342

We thought we might
find somebody we know.

343
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,348
My grandfather owns this land.

344
00:14:09,431 --> 00:14:11,725

I am the elder here. This is our land.

00:14:18,232 --> 00:14:21,652
And you would be wise to never

[strums guitar]

349
00:14:25,447 --> 00:14:28,409

353
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:39,587
Who were those scary, handsome Mexicans

354
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:40,963
on those magical horses?

355
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:43,757
They just looked like old white men to me.

356
00:14:43,841 --> 00:14:44,884
Oh.

357
00:14:44,967 --> 00:14:46,635
We should probably get out of here.

358
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:49,388
Yeah, I mean,
I've got a big job on Monday, anyway.

359
00:14:49,471 --> 00:14:52,766
I was gonna have to leave early,
and I didn't know how to tell you.

360
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:55,269
But now we can just all go together.

361
00:14:55,352 --> 00:14:57,605
[Ron] <i>And that's when he saw his opening.</i>

362
00:14:57,688 --> 00:14:58,522
Never.

363
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:01,609
Never. Are you...?

364
00:15:01,692 --> 00:15:03,193
No. I mean, we're Bluths.

365
00:15:03,277 --> 00:15:04,862
We're gonna stay. Maeby, too. We're...

366
00:15:04,945 --> 00:15:06,322
The two of us are gonna stay.

367
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:08,824
[Ron] <i>And soon,</i>
<i>being with his cousin was no longer</i>

368
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:10,910
<i>-an obstacle...</i>
-[George Michael] Crazy asshole.

369
00:15:10,993 --> 00:15:13,704
<i>...to George Michael's hope</i>
<i>of being with his cousin.</i>

370
00:15:13,787 --> 00:15:15,205
I was wondering how you were
gonna get rid of him.

371
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:17,416
-Was I that obvious?
-I just know that you don't like

372
00:15:17,499 --> 00:15:19,585
standing up to people
on horses with guns.

373
00:15:19,668 --> 00:15:20,920
No, I never really was that guy.

374
00:15:21,295 --> 00:15:23,422
-Let's find a bar.
-Okay. Yeah, I'd love that.

375
00:15:23,505 --> 00:15:25,758
[Ron] <i>And so, after getting out</i>
<i>of their dusty clothes,</i>

376
00:15:25,841 --> 00:15:27,009
<i>the two did just that.</i>

377
00:15:27,885 --> 00:15:28,802
<i>And George Michael</i>

378
00:15:28,886 --> 00:15:31,138
<i>was soon getting a real feel</i>
<i>for the people.</i>

379
00:15:31,221 --> 00:15:32,973
Hey. You're not gonna believe this.

380
00:15:33,057 --> 00:15:35,184
I met these guys that are actually
from Orange County.

381
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:37,394
And two of them also go to UCI.

382
00:15:37,478 --> 00:15:40,356
Two of them are named Noah,
but not the two that you'd think.

383
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:41,315
-Cool?
-Really cool.

384
00:15:41,398 --> 00:15:44,234
They're staying here, renting a place
while they do this language course.

385
00:15:44,318 --> 00:15:45,569
We could stay with them.

386
00:15:46,028 --> 00:15:47,571
I'm thinking about heading back.

387
00:15:47,655 --> 00:15:48,656
N... Wait, look.

388
00:15:48,739 --> 00:15:51,241
If this is about me firing you
from Fakeblock,

389
00:15:51,325 --> 00:15:52,701
there's something you should know.

390
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:55,704
Fakeblock doesn't actually exist.

391
00:15:56,747 --> 00:15:59,416
Are you telling me that the software

392
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:02,086
that's supposed to keep
people's computers unhackable

393
00:16:02,169 --> 00:16:06,590
and keep any kind of information private
doesn't exist?

394
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:09,218
How did you find out?

395
00:16:09,301 --> 00:16:12,096
It was easy. I just looked in
your computer under "Secrets."

396
00:16:12,179 --> 00:16:14,181
Oh, you looked
in my "Please Don't Read" folder?

397
00:16:14,264 --> 00:16:17,142
No, that one was empty.
I found it in "Just Odds and Ends."

398
00:16:17,226 --> 00:16:18,811
Great, you got past my double bluff.

399
00:16:18,894 --> 00:16:21,605
It's okay, George Michael.
You worry too much.

400
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:24,817
Yeah, that keeps me up at night, actually.

401
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:28,112
I just feel like I gotta move on
with my life, you know?

402
00:16:28,195 --> 00:16:29,613
Find some meaning.

403
00:16:30,072 --> 00:16:31,865
Get going with my own goop.

404
00:16:31,949 --> 00:16:33,617
Goop? What is goop?

405
00:16:33,701 --> 00:16:36,120
If you have to ask,
you probably don't know what it is.

406
00:16:36,203 --> 00:16:37,663
I don't know what it is.

407
00:16:37,788 --> 00:16:39,623
I feel like maybe
you don't know what it is.

408
00:16:39,707 --> 00:16:41,083
Maybe it's "go-op"?

409
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:43,210
To me, that would make less sense.

410
00:16:43,711 --> 00:16:45,504
Maybe that's what "go-op" is.

411
00:16:45,879 --> 00:16:48,382
Not everything always making sense.

412
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:50,551
[Ron] <i>It isn't.</i>

413
00:16:50,634 --> 00:16:53,762
<i>Meanwhile,</i>
<i>George Sr. and G.O.B. continued trying</i>

414
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:55,264
<i>to out-goop each other.</i>

415
00:16:55,347 --> 00:16:58,017
I won't tell Mom
about all the ladies you're [bleeps]

416
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:01,145
if you don't tell Mom
about all the ladies I'm [bleeps].

417
00:17:01,603 --> 00:17:04,189
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Look at that one coming up.

418
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:05,607
Where, where? Oh, my God.

419
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:08,068
Oh, she's hot. She's so hot. Dibs!

420
00:17:08,152 --> 00:17:09,945
No, no, no, Daddy saw her first.

421
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:12,781
-Daddy dibs.
-She got a friend or...?

422
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:14,283
She's got a friend! That's a friend?

423
00:17:15,993 --> 00:17:18,245
[G.O.B.] <i>Bush.</i> <i>Trash bag and bush.</i>

424
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:20,622
-Thought it was a woman.
-Yeah.

425
00:17:20,789 --> 00:17:22,082
-Like, hunched over, right?
-Yeah.

426
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:24,960
Like, with the...
I wanted to do her so bad.

427
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:27,880
Wow. I mean, I...
And I really liked her friend.

428
00:17:27,963 --> 00:17:30,090
Me, I liked her, too.

429
00:17:33,635 --> 00:17:36,221
-That was a ten-gallon Hefty sack?
-Oh, yeah.

430
00:17:36,305 --> 00:17:39,224
-Yeah, a ten. Definitely a ten.
-Yeah. Yeah. Nice.

431
00:17:40,142 --> 00:17:41,268
I like.

432
00:17:41,977 --> 00:17:44,605
I like... a ten.

433
00:17:45,981 --> 00:17:49,485
[Ron] <i>And Lucille,</i> <i>at the behest of</i>
<i>her court-mandated therapist,</i>

434
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:53,238
<i>-was struggling to make sense of things.</i>
-Am I horrible for saying these things?

435
00:17:53,322 --> 00:17:56,075
No. But I was doing the math,
and I still think

436
00:17:56,158 --> 00:17:59,078
you're gonna have a problem
with this final "raped murderer."

437
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:01,872
But who cares about him?

438
00:18:02,331 --> 00:18:04,166
Oh, this is pointless.

439
00:18:04,249 --> 00:18:06,502
How many more sessions
do I have to endure

440
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:07,711
until I'm done with...

441
00:18:08,253 --> 00:18:10,047
-no offense... you?
-[chuckles]

442
00:18:10,172 --> 00:18:13,926
Legally, two. But I am in the family.

443
00:18:15,844 --> 00:18:19,014
I mean... this is my family.

444
00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:23,060
My daughter is divorcing you.
This is it.

445
00:18:23,143 --> 00:18:25,062
I'm confused by the word "it."

446
00:18:25,145 --> 00:18:28,524
Are you implying that you
don't want to see me anymore?

447
00:18:28,857 --> 00:18:31,443
I'm confused by the word "anymore."

448
00:18:32,486 --> 00:18:34,279
There are many things
I can do for this family.

449
00:18:34,363 --> 00:18:37,533
You've lost touch with your daughter.
Put me in, for God sakes.

450
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:41,328
-I thought this was <i>my </i>time.
-It is your time. Yes, yes.

451
00:18:41,411 --> 00:18:43,413
But as your therapist,
I'm pointing out that I know

452
00:18:43,497 --> 00:18:45,624
that you build these walls
to keep out, for instance,

453
00:18:45,707 --> 00:18:47,626
your surviving children-in-law.

454
00:18:47,709 --> 00:18:50,003
Oh, don't talk to me about walls.

455
00:18:50,087 --> 00:18:52,047
That's why we're in this mess.

456
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:54,341
My husband buys land
so we can get a contract

457
00:18:54,424 --> 00:18:56,385
to build a little something on the border.

458
00:18:56,468 --> 00:18:57,928
A-a wall.

459
00:18:58,011 --> 00:19:00,013
And we did everything right.

460
00:19:00,097 --> 00:19:01,473
[Ron] <i>Well, not everything.</i>

461
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:04,434
<i>They did buy land on the border...</i>

462
00:19:04,518 --> 00:19:06,812
-You live here?
<i>-...to sell back to the government.</i>

463
00:19:06,895 --> 00:19:08,272
-The check.
-[Ron] <i>And they paid off</i>

464
00:19:08,355 --> 00:19:10,357
<i>-a politician...</i>
-I am gonna put this on my <i>wall.</i>

465
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:11,525
<i>...to stir up xenophobia.</i>

466
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:15,112
We have got to build a wall
between us and Mexico.

467
00:19:15,195 --> 00:19:16,989
-Yeah, yeah.
-[Ron] <i>Of course, they made</i>

468
00:19:17,072 --> 00:19:20,409
<i>-a few rookie mistakes.</i>
-I bribed Love to get the wall,

469
00:19:20,492 --> 00:19:22,953
and I don't have the land to build it on!

470
00:19:23,036 --> 00:19:24,037
[Ron] <i>Well, they had it.</i>

471
00:19:24,121 --> 00:19:26,331
<i>It was just on the wrong side</i>
<i>of the border.</i>

472
00:19:26,874 --> 00:19:29,793
<i>Which they might have known</i>
<i>had George's brother Oscar</i>

473
00:19:29,877 --> 00:19:31,837
<i>-not burned the signs.</i>
-It's okay to burn these?

474
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:34,256
Well, this is America.
They don't want us to burn signs,

475
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:35,924
they shouldn't write 'em in Spanish.

476
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:38,760
[Ron] <i>And so, Lucille did</i>
<i>what her own government might do.</i>

477
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:41,638
Who better than the Chinese
to help us build a wall, right?

478
00:19:41,722 --> 00:19:44,224
-[Ron] <i>She borrowed from the Chinese.</i>
-That's good enough.

479
00:19:44,308 --> 00:19:46,101
-[crying]
-[Ron] <i>Of course, none of this</i>

480
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:48,562
<i>-was okay with the woman...</i>
-How dare you?!

481
00:19:48,645 --> 00:19:50,314
<i>-...who owned a majority stake...</i>
-Lucille...

482
00:19:50,397 --> 00:19:51,356
<i>-...in the company.</i>
-...Two

483
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,942
I can't be running a company
that's building a wall

484
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:55,235
I campaigned against!

485
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:57,571
[Ron] <i>And with their politician</i>
<i>out of the race,</i>

486
00:19:57,654 --> 00:19:59,281
<i>their future looked bleak.</i>

487
00:19:59,364 --> 00:20:02,159
So, unless some angel descends
on a golden chariot,

489
00:20:04,786 --> 00:20:08,707
And maybe you don't want
to get hurt because,

490
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:13,337
as I say, hurt people... hurt people.

491
00:20:13,795 --> 00:20:15,088
Oh, that's nice.

492
00:20:15,923 --> 00:20:19,301
I always say,
"Make people cry, make people cry."

493
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:21,011
But yours includes the people

494
00:20:21,094 --> 00:20:23,388

the satisfaction.

You know what, let's lock that in there.

498
00:20:30,395 --> 00:20:32,898

some real good progress today.

499

Yes. [chuckles]
I really think this is working.

[Ron] <i>Lindsay had also made it to Mexico,</i>

Can I buy you lunch?

513

We are lucky. We have next to nothing.

Barack Obama.

525
00:21:35,419 --> 00:21:37,087
Their old country is their mother,

526

527
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:40,966
Imagine if your mother

528
00:21:41,049 --> 00:21:43,760
So, you're trying to, like,
teach them a lesson or...?

529

We're volunteers.

537
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:08,869

[Ron] <i>He was noticing subtle differences</i>

God, the salt is different here.

-[Ron] <i>They saw foreign films.</i>
-I'm glad someone had the guts

It's in English.
