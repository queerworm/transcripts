00:00:11,594 --> 00:00:13,930
[Ron Howard] <i>Michael had decided</i>
<i>to leave town,</i>

2
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:16,975
<i>and needed to get out of</i>
<i>his obligation to make a movie</i>

3
00:00:17,058 --> 00:00:19,436
<i>-about his family.</i>
-Michael! You had one job.

4
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:22,355
You had to get your son
to sign the releases!

5
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:25,108
Ron Howard wants to make
a heartfelt father-son drama

6
00:00:25,191 --> 00:00:28,194
that has a good clean message
for his illegitimate daughter to star in.

7
00:00:28,278 --> 00:00:29,988
Don't pull this on me!
We've already reserved

8
00:00:30,071 --> 00:00:32,198
the soundstages
and he's already started paying off

9
00:00:32,282 --> 00:00:34,409
-the Hollywood Foreign Press.
-[Ron] <i>No, they're great.</i>

10
00:00:34,492 --> 00:00:36,161
<i>-She's funny.</i>
-I understand all of that.

11
00:00:36,244 --> 00:00:39,247
Okay, but Rebel is part of
the reason why I can't do this.

12
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:41,332
My son is dating her,
and I don't want to get

13
00:00:41,416 --> 00:00:42,917
in the way. If I could talk to Ron,

14
00:00:43,001 --> 00:00:44,794
-No. No. I am in charge
-I'm sure he and I...

15
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:46,838
of this movie right now.
My ass is on the line

16
00:00:46,921 --> 00:00:49,174
while Ron makes a real movie in Mexico.

17
00:00:49,257 --> 00:00:51,134
-Mexico, okay.
-You don't understand

18
00:00:51,217 --> 00:00:52,844
how hard it is in Hollywood right now.

19
00:00:52,927 --> 00:00:54,429
You have to crank out family dramas

20
00:00:54,512 --> 00:00:57,098
before they let you make
your dream superhero movie.

21
00:00:57,182 --> 00:00:59,100
Do you have a dream superhero movie?

22
00:00:59,184 --> 00:01:01,519
I want to remake <i>Spider-Man 2,</i>
the first one.

23
00:01:02,103 --> 00:01:04,064
Or something that at least has a hook.

24
00:01:04,647 --> 00:01:07,817
-...little girl! [screams]
-Oh, God! Damn it.

25
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:10,028
My brother Buster has something
better than a hook.

26
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:13,782
A robot hand. Okay?
And there's a cop looking for him.

27
00:01:13,865 --> 00:01:15,992
-Hmm.
-And they can't find Lucille 2.

28
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:18,161
And I found Buster in the attic
in scuba gear.

29
00:01:18,244 --> 00:01:20,121
It's intriguing.
I think that's your movie.

30
00:01:20,205 --> 00:01:21,664
-That's your guy.
-No.

31
00:01:21,748 --> 00:01:23,625
Okay, I've got his release right here.

32
00:01:23,708 --> 00:01:26,086
[Ron] <i>In fact,</i>
<i>it was the only family member's release...</i>

33
00:01:26,544 --> 00:01:28,546
You're out of the movie.
You're out of the movie.

34
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:30,340
<i>-...he hadn't destroyed.</i>
-You're out of the movie.

35
00:01:30,423 --> 00:01:32,217
You're out of the movie!
Know what?

36
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:33,676
-You're out of the movie.
-Fine.

37
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,095
Hey, Dad, how ya doing?

38
00:01:35,637 --> 00:01:38,056
-You're out of the movie!
-[Michael] <i>With Buster,</i>

39
00:01:38,139 --> 00:01:40,767
it is not father-son,
it's more mother-son.

40
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:43,728
But if you could get Rebel
to play Lucille, you know...

41
00:01:43,812 --> 00:01:45,230
If she could go that unlikable.

42
00:01:45,313 --> 00:01:46,815
So that's his release right here.

43
00:01:47,357 --> 00:01:49,400
These are the other releases.
You need tape,

44
00:01:49,484 --> 00:01:51,027
but they're pretty clean.

45
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:54,405
You're off the picture, Michael.
I'll give you your 500 bucks.

46
00:01:55,281 --> 00:01:57,325
-I get paid?
-They're Imagine dollars.

47
00:01:57,408 --> 00:01:58,993
They're redeemable in the gift shop.

48
00:01:59,077 --> 00:02:01,246
-That's Ron Howard.
-Brian's on the 50.

49
00:02:01,329 --> 00:02:04,207
It's a severance thing they're doing
because of Ron's need to be loved

50
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:05,917
and Brian's conflict avoidance issues.

51
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,254
[Ron] <i>Michael had gotten into something</i>
<i>he wanted no part of.</i>

52
00:02:09,337 --> 00:02:11,131
I'm sure they've got
a very old relationship.

53
00:02:11,214 --> 00:02:12,632
I could tell you stories.

54
00:02:12,715 --> 00:02:15,718
[Ron] <i>But she wouldn't dare.</i>
<i>And after a quick stop downstairs...</i>

55
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:17,303
I think I'm gonna take

56
00:02:17,387 --> 00:02:19,180
one <i>Gung Ho </i>kimono, okay?

57
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:21,558
Oh, and maybe a Brian wig. That's fun.

58
00:02:21,641 --> 00:02:23,893
-Oh, we only sell these as a set.
-[line ringing]

59
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:25,395
They were getting very competitive.

60
00:02:25,478 --> 00:02:27,063
-Were they?
-[whispers] Brian was.

61
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:28,481
<i>...and another call to his son...</i>

62
00:02:28,565 --> 00:02:30,358
[George Michael]
<i>You've reached George Maharis.</i>

63
00:02:30,441 --> 00:02:32,735
[in normal voice]
Did you want that Rebel Alley hair?

64
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:34,070
Oh. Uh, no no.

65
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:35,738
That's... that is mine.

66
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:37,991
-I came with that. Uh, okay.
<i>-...Michael headed home</i>

67
00:02:38,074 --> 00:02:41,703
<i>to tell Buster his plan</i>
<i>for making the family come back.</i>

68
00:02:41,786 --> 00:02:44,581
I've sent away the fumigator,
and all you got to do,

69
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:46,416
so we can declare you missing,

70
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:48,459
is stay out of sight for about 72 hours.

71
00:02:48,543 --> 00:02:50,086
-Milford style.
-Hmm?

72
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:52,005
-I'm a Milford man, Michael.
-Yeah?

73
00:02:52,088 --> 00:02:54,799
Winner of 1982's Least Seen on Campus.

74
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:58,678
I wish I could've seen their faces

75
00:02:58,761 --> 00:02:59,971
-at the ceremony.
-We just,

76
00:03:00,054 --> 00:03:02,348
you know, we gotta play this right
and, uh,

77
00:03:02,432 --> 00:03:03,975
you gotta make sure you don't...

78
00:03:04,893 --> 00:03:07,896
-well, show your hand.
-This is one of only two things

79
00:03:07,979 --> 00:03:10,481
the Army warns us about
when they issue these.

80
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:13,067
Boy, Kitty does not know
what she's sitting on.

81
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:16,237
Pal, I'm gonna call you from,
uh, wherever I end up,

82
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:18,406
and you're gonna be great.

83
00:03:18,489 --> 00:03:21,492
I-I just don't understand why
I can't go with you, Michael.

84
00:03:21,576 --> 00:03:23,328
It's about teaching them a lesson.

85
00:03:23,411 --> 00:03:24,746
-Mm-hmm.
-So... And I just,

86
00:03:24,829 --> 00:03:26,789
I got in a big fight with my son,
you know.

87
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:28,458
It was my fault. For so many years,

88
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:29,918
I was his mom and dad, so...

89
00:03:30,793 --> 00:03:33,254
Maybe that's a role
I can play in your life.

90
00:03:33,338 --> 00:03:34,339
[stammers] Don't say--

91
00:03:34,422 --> 00:03:36,174
Mom. Mmm.

92
00:03:38,009 --> 00:03:39,552
I thought you were gonna say Dad.

93
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:41,012
-Mm-mm.
-But, you know,

94
00:03:41,095 --> 00:03:43,389
it's a bummer
that you can't come with me, Buster,

95
00:03:43,473 --> 00:03:45,141
but you need to stay and talk to the cops.

96
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:46,351
[Buster] Cops? What cops?

97
00:03:46,976 --> 00:03:50,021
-Why would you bring the cops into this?
-They're already looking for you.

98
00:03:50,104 --> 00:03:52,273
What? The cops are looking for me?

99
00:03:52,357 --> 00:03:54,525
<i>-A </i>cop, actually.
-I can't be talking to the cops.

100
00:03:54,609 --> 00:03:56,694
-Listen.
-I don't do good with the cops.

101
00:03:56,778 --> 00:03:58,238
I didn't do anything.
I don't know what's going on.

102
00:03:58,321 --> 00:04:00,573
-Relax.
-I ain't got no truck with no blue.

103
00:04:00,657 --> 00:04:01,783
Nothing to worry about.

104
00:04:01,866 --> 00:04:04,077
They're looking for Lucille Austero.
They want to question you.

105
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:07,872
Why would I know anything about Lucille 2?
I hope you didn't say we were dating.

106
00:04:07,956 --> 00:04:11,084
Uh, well, I mean, you...
you did live with her.

107
00:04:11,167 --> 00:04:14,587
Well, I lived with Mother.
Did you think we were dating? [chuckles]

108
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:17,632
-Question's been asked.
-[whimpers]

109
00:04:17,715 --> 00:04:19,968
-Do you actually know where Lucille 2 is?
-No!

110
00:04:20,051 --> 00:04:22,428
No! A thousand times, no!

111
00:04:23,012 --> 00:04:24,013
Is that what they'll ask?

112
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:26,015
'Cause it's not like I'm gonna
remember details

113
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:27,934
about where I saw her
and what we fought about.

114
00:04:28,017 --> 00:04:29,102
Oh, you fought?

115
00:04:29,185 --> 00:04:31,396
You kept me from Mother?

116
00:04:31,479 --> 00:04:33,690
You sent her to prison?

117
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:36,234
[growls]

118
00:04:36,317 --> 00:04:37,777
Should I not say that?

119
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:40,989
-I'm not good with the cops.
-Right.

120
00:04:41,072 --> 00:04:43,866
What if Lucille 2 doesn't come back?

121
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:47,287
Don't worry about that.
She-- I just spoke to her today.

122
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:50,039
-What? In person?
-Yeah. Uh, no.

123
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:51,165
On the phone. She's fine.

124
00:04:51,249 --> 00:04:53,418
Well, you could've told me that
from the beginning.

125
00:04:53,501 --> 00:04:55,795
This is not about Lucille 2.
This is about teaching Mom

126
00:04:55,878 --> 00:04:57,005
-a lesson, you know.
-Oh.

127
00:04:57,088 --> 00:04:58,589
I mean, she just splits town

128
00:04:58,673 --> 00:05:00,925
and assumes
I'm gonna take care of everything?

129
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:02,719
You know, this is just a way to, uh...

130
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:04,721
-Give Mom a little scare.
-Yeah.

131
00:05:04,804 --> 00:05:08,308
Yeah. Let them race back into town
and save everyone for a change.

132
00:05:08,391 --> 00:05:09,684
There's nothing to worry about.

133
00:05:09,767 --> 00:05:12,645
Just Mama's worst nightmare.
Buster's missing.

134
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:15,523
Oh, and his bath has gone cold. [laughs]

135

[Ron] <i>Buster was on board.</i>

136
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:20,194
Maybe have a full psych panel
while you're in there, too.

137
00:05:20,278 --> 00:05:22,113

-Hopi Indians believe that this spot...

165
00:06:41,317 --> 00:06:42,527
-Okay.
-...when manipulated,

166
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:44,278
can create sexual feeling.

167
00:06:44,362 --> 00:06:46,239
-That's my penis.
-You don't have to tell me.

168
00:06:46,322 --> 00:06:47,907
[Ron] <i>Which sent him into his crisis...</i>

169
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:49,951
[doctor] I can get hard,

170

<i>...of masculinity.</i>

171
00:06:51,369 --> 00:06:53,704
Hey, these are from the ladies
across the bar.

172
00:06:53,788 --> 00:06:55,957
-They're <i>primas.</i>
-[George Sr.] <i>Primos, </i>huh?

173
00:06:57,333 --> 00:06:59,252
I've gotta be honest, I've seen better.

174
00:06:59,335 --> 00:07:00,962
Huh? Eh.

175
00:07:01,045 --> 00:07:02,213
{\an8}No, it means cousins.

176
00:07:02,713 --> 00:07:05,383
{\an8}One hates her father,
and the other hates her grandfather.

177
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:08,261
{\an8}[Ron] <i>It seemed the cervezas</i>

178
00:07:08,344 --> 00:07:11,222
{\an8}<i>weren't the only thing being handed</i>

179
00:07:12,723 --> 00:07:15,268
{\an8}I don't know about you,
but I'd prefer the thrill of the hunt,

180
00:07:15,351 --> 00:07:16,978
{\an8}-as opposed to...
-[George Sr.] If we wait,

181
00:07:17,061 --> 00:07:19,647
{\an8}something a little better will come along.

182
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:20,898
{\an8}Thank you.

183
00:07:20,982 --> 00:07:22,859
{\an8}Not trying to fall
head over heels here.

184
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:24,360
{\an8}Yeah. Yeah.

185
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:26,404
{\an8}Not super eager to be, uh,
missing somebody.

186
00:07:26,487 --> 00:07:29,615
{\an8}-Yeah.
-[chuckles] I mean, who you love.

187
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:36,372
{\an8}-Place gives me the creeps. Let's get out.
-Yeah. It's dead.

188
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:39,125
{\an8}[Ron] <i>But back in America,</i>
<i>Michael was working on a way</i>

189

{\an8}<i>to make his runaway family return.</i>

190
00:07:42,003 --> 00:07:45,173
So, we gotta wait about 48 hours
before we declare you missing,

191
00:07:45,256 --> 00:07:47,008
-and then they put out an APB.
-APB.

192
00:07:47,091 --> 00:07:48,509
"Aw, poor Buster."

193
00:07:48,593 --> 00:07:49,635
-That's nice.
-Well...

194
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:52,346
You gotta lay low long enough
for Mom and Dad to hear about it.

195
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:54,724
And, pal, I would take you with me,
but truth is, I just,

196
00:07:54,807 --> 00:07:56,642
I don't know if I'm gonna come back.

197
00:08:02,231 --> 00:08:04,650
Oh. [chuckling]

198
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:06,110
What's so funny?

199
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:10,656
You always come back to save the family.
We joke about that all the time.

200
00:08:11,365 --> 00:08:14,994
Well, I don't know what the joke is.
I've been trying to do the right thing.

201
00:08:15,077 --> 00:08:17,663
[laughs] "Hi, I'm Michael,

202
00:08:17,747 --> 00:08:21,083
and I save everyone so I feel special,
even though you don't deserve it.

203
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:22,627
I'm leaving. I won't be coming back."

204

-Buster...
-"Oh!

205
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:25,713
Look who's back.

206
00:08:25,796 --> 00:08:28,508
I thought we were supposed to go [bleeps]
with a [bleeps]."

207
00:08:28,591 --> 00:08:31,052
"Mmm, you would know, Mother.
You practically invented

208
00:08:31,135 --> 00:08:34,055
[bleeps] [bleeps] when you get sauced!"
[gasps]

209

00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:42,730
I can't believe I pushed you
out of my [bleeps],

212
00:08:42,813 --> 00:08:45,024

213
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:48,319
-[inhales deeply]
-Covered a lot of ground there.

214
00:08:48,402 --> 00:08:49,278
Yeah.

215
00:08:49,445 --> 00:08:51,405
Although I'm glad
I won't be leaving you alone.

216
00:08:52,323 --> 00:08:53,407
Oh, I'm going with you?

217
00:08:53,491 --> 00:08:55,535
No, I'm going to Mexico or something,

218
00:08:55,618 --> 00:08:57,537
and you gotta go to the police station.

219
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:59,914
-Oh, right. Why do they arrest me?
-They don't.

220
00:08:59,997 --> 00:09:01,666
You go to the police station
'cause you say,

221
00:09:01,749 --> 00:09:03,501
"Heard you were looking for me.
Here I am."

222
00:09:03,584 --> 00:09:05,503
Oh, but you said a cop had questions
for me.

223
00:09:05,586 --> 00:09:06,671
Mm-hmm. About Lucille 2.

224
00:09:06,754 --> 00:09:08,714
And I'm not gonna answer
any questions, right?

225
00:09:08,798 --> 00:09:10,967
-No. Answer the questions.
-When Barry says it's okay.

226
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:13,261
Barry's not there. No attorneys.
Just tell the truth.

227
00:09:13,344 --> 00:09:15,346
Okay, like, bad example,

228
00:09:15,429 --> 00:09:19,100
I saw Lucille 2's lifeless body
sprawled across the stair car?

229
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:26,274
Perfect.
If that's what happened, tell them.

230
00:09:26,357 --> 00:09:28,025
Nothing to be nervous about, okay?

231
00:09:28,109 --> 00:09:29,860
Lucille 2 is probably gonna be back

232
00:09:29,944 --> 00:09:31,237
from whatever bender she's on.

233
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,406
She's gonna be as dry as, uh...

234
00:09:33,489 --> 00:09:35,032
well, Lucille 1.

235
00:09:35,116 --> 00:09:36,617
I can hear Mother winking now.

236
00:09:36,701 --> 00:09:39,620
So, I got some groceries.
These are gonna have to last.

237
00:09:39,704 --> 00:09:41,998
You already got into the candy bears, huh?

238
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:43,874
[Buster] This is literally one of only

239
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:46,711
two things the Army warns about
when they issue these.

240
00:09:46,794 --> 00:09:48,087
-Let me help.
-I think they spent

241
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:50,590
$27 million on the wrong guy.

242
00:09:50,673 --> 00:09:52,717
Don't you say that about you. Well...

243
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,428
Maybe you do say that.
Maybe that's important to say.

244
00:09:55,511 --> 00:09:58,139
[Ron] <i>And certain</i>
<i>his mother would have to return</i>

-[phone vibrates]
-Ooh.

249
00:10:12,028 --> 00:10:13,404
Hey, I am outside your door.

250
00:10:13,487 --> 00:10:15,489
I was this close to telling you.
You inside?

251
00:10:15,573 --> 00:10:17,908
[Lucille 2] <i>Hi, it's Lucille Austero.</i>

252
00:10:17,992 --> 00:10:19,410
-No!
<i>-I've been looking for you.</i>

253
00:10:20,036 --> 00:10:21,495
-Note, I mean.
-[Lucille 2 chattering]

254
00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:23,414
I know, I'd left you a note,

255
00:10:23,497 --> 00:10:26,292
-and, can you hear me?
-[Lucille 2 continues chattering]

256
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:29,378
Hello? Hello? Here we go again.

257
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:30,713
Getting disconnected.

258
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:33,966
This is why you always... leave a note.

259
00:10:34,842 --> 00:10:36,260
Always leave a note.

260
00:10:36,886 --> 00:10:38,054
Where's that from?

261
00:10:38,554 --> 00:10:41,641
[Ron] <i>Michael discovered</i>
<i>a note he'd already written.</i>

262
00:10:41,724 --> 00:10:43,517
[Michael] "Are you avoiding me? Ha ha.

263
00:10:43,601 --> 00:10:45,478
Leaving town for a while. Love you.

264
00:10:45,561 --> 00:10:47,063
-Michael Bluth."
-[Ron] <i>It worked well.</i>

265
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:55,279
<i>But perhaps if Michael</i>
<i>had taken a few seconds</i>

266
00:10:55,363 --> 00:10:57,907
<i>to write an original note</i>
<i>before leaving town,</i>

267
00:10:58,824 --> 00:11:02,453
<i>he would've run into George Michael,</i>
<i>who was coming to see him...</i>

268
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,999
<i>only to come across a cousin</i>
<i>he didn't recognize.</i>

269
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:09,835
-Hey. Know if anyone's home?
-[Steve] Uh, yeah, Buster's in there.

270
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:12,588
But if you're looking for Michael,
you just missed him.

271
00:11:14,048 --> 00:11:16,175
-[sighs]
-Oh, so much for apologizing.

272
00:11:16,258 --> 00:11:18,094
I'm telling you, he's moved on.

273
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:20,930
-Okay? You should, too.
-[Steve] I just found out

274
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:22,598
my dad went to Mexico without telling me.

275
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:24,767
[chuckles] Welcome
to the shitty parents club.

276
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:26,602
-No, no, we don't have kids.
-No.

277
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:28,229
[Ron] <i>Although there was a kid</i>

278
00:11:28,312 --> 00:11:30,398
<i>that Maeby was eager to get away from.</i>

279
00:11:30,481 --> 00:11:33,192
You know,
Mexico sounds far from Perfecto.

280
00:11:33,275 --> 00:11:35,778
So that's perfect.
What do you say? Screw it!

281
00:11:35,861 --> 00:11:37,405
No rules. Anything goes.

282
00:11:37,488 --> 00:11:40,950
[Ron] <i>A rebounding George Michael</i>
<i>found the offer intriguing.</i>

283
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:42,952
-Just the cousins.
-Mm-hmm.

284
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:44,370
[Ron] <i>Which turned out to be...</i>

285
00:11:44,453 --> 00:11:47,123
<i>-Primos! </i>[laughs]
<i>-...this crew.</i>

286
00:11:48,082 --> 00:11:50,251
-Why do you keep yelling that?
-[laughing] Stop it.

287
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:52,545
Ah.

288
00:11:55,256 --> 00:11:58,259
[Ron] <i>Not far away,</i>
<i>Michael was also heading to Mexico.</i>

289

290
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:03,848
[Michael] <i>It's Buster Bluth, that's right.</i>

291
00:12:03,931 --> 00:12:06,642
<i>Uh, yeah, I'm completely sure</i>
<i>he's been gone 72 hours.</i>

292
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:08,436
<i>As a matter of fact,</i>
<i>his bath has grown cold.</i>

293
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:11,021
<i>So that's, uh, an alarm bell right there.</i>

294
00:12:11,105 --> 00:12:12,732
[Ron] <i>...Michael was ready</i>
<i>to hit bottom</i>

295
00:12:12,815 --> 00:12:14,900
<i>-and go off the map.</i>
-[Michael] <i>Thanks so much.</i>

296
00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:16,694
[Ron] <i>But that's hard to do</i>

297
00:12:16,777 --> 00:12:19,113
<i>when you're driving a car</i>
<i>that makes maps.</i>

298
00:12:19,196 --> 00:12:20,656
[Michael] No pictures, thank you!

299
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,491
Put your phones down.
We take the pictures.

300
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:25,286
[Ron] <i>When the fleet</i>

-No! Window up.

-Window...
-Hi, I'm Dave from Mapping.

305
00:12:35,713 --> 00:12:37,673

-And that's Jeff.
-I'm Jeff from Earth.

307
00:12:41,093 --> 00:12:43,429
-Hi. Hi, guys.
-[Dave] We heard we had a runaway ostrich,

308
00:12:43,512 --> 00:12:45,556
and, uh, we need you to return the car.

309
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:48,517
Oh, yeah. Sorry. Am I under arrest?

310
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:50,853
Oh, no. They never arrest the drivers.

311
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:52,730
They do come down pretty hard
on the cars,

312
00:12:52,813 --> 00:12:55,065
but it's cheaper to just retrain
the people instead.

313
00:12:55,149 --> 00:12:58,110
It sounds super futuristic and dystopian,
but it's really not.

[Ron] <i>Earth was right.</i>

How did you find out?

395
00:16:09,301 --> 00:16:12,096
It was easy. I just looked in
your computer under "Secrets."

396
00:16:12,179 --> 00:16:14,181
Oh, you looked
in my "Please Don't Read" folder?

397
00:16:14,264 --> 00:16:17,142
No, that one was empty.
I found it in "Just Odds and Ends."

Great, you got past my double bluff.

You worry too much.

you probably don't know what it is.

you don't know what it is.

408
00:16:39,707 --> 00:16:41,083
Maybe it's "go-op"?

409
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:43,210
To me, that would make less sense.

489
00:20:04,786 --> 00:20:08,707
And maybe you don't want
to get hurt because,

490
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:13,337
as I say, hurt people... hurt people.

491
00:20:13,795 --> 00:20:15,088
Oh, that's nice.

492
00:20:15,923 --> 00:20:19,301
I always say,
"Make people cry, make people cry."

493
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:21,011
But yours includes the people

494
00:20:21,094 --> 00:20:23,388

the satisfaction.

You know what, let's lock that in there.

498
00:20:30,395 --> 00:20:32,898

some real good progress today.

499
00:20:32,981 --> 00:20:35,817
Yes. [chuckles]
I really think this is working.

[Ron] <i>Lindsay had also made it to Mexico,</i>

Can I buy you lunch?

513

We are lucky. We have next to nothing.

We are helping these people

Barack Obama.

525
00:21:35,419 --> 00:21:37,087
Their old country is their mother,

526
00:21:37,337 --> 00:21:38,755

527
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:40,966
Imagine if your mother

528
00:21:41,049 --> 00:21:43,760
So, you're trying to, like,
teach them a lesson or...?

529

We're volunteers.

537
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:08,869

[Ron] <i>He was noticing subtle differences</i>

God, the salt is different here.

-[Ron] <i>They saw foreign films.</i>
-I'm glad someone had the guts
