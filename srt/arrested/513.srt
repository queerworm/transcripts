[Lucille] Gotta avoid the sun.

8
00:00:35,994 --> 00:00:36,870
Right there.

9
00:00:38,705 --> 00:00:40,999
Sorry, Gob. Looks like there
isn't gonna be enough for you.

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,960
I never should have done Lindsay first.

11
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:46,087
Lindsay's having a widening spurt.

12
00:00:46,171 --> 00:00:49,674
Please, I don't need any suntan lotion.
Dad never wears any.

13
00:00:49,966 --> 00:00:52,469
Yeah. And he's doing fine
in the lady department.

14
00:00:52,552 --> 00:00:55,221
-[Lucille chuckles] Oh.
-[George Sr.] Well, Buster doesn't know

15
00:00:55,305 --> 00:00:57,557
what the hell he's talking about!

16
00:00:59,476 --> 00:01:02,270
I think Buster was actually talking
about Mom.

17
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,985
Oh, yes. No, uh... I thought...

18
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:11,780
you were talking about recent--
Yes, thank you.

19
00:01:12,405 --> 00:01:15,992
Yes, she is, uh...
She is quite the beauty.

20
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:19,788
You kids have a lot of competition

21
00:01:19,871 --> 00:01:21,623
for this year's family pageant.

22
00:01:22,248 --> 00:01:24,667
Who is going to be...

23
00:01:25,168 --> 00:01:28,463
Mr. and Mrs. Bluth 1982?

24
00:01:28,546 --> 00:01:30,465
[Lucille laughs] Oh!

25
00:01:32,008 --> 00:01:33,009
[Lindsay sighs]

26
00:01:33,093 --> 00:01:34,469
It's always you guys.

27
00:01:34,552 --> 00:01:37,222
-[chuckles]
-[Lindsay] We don't have a chance.

28
00:01:38,473 --> 00:01:41,476
Well, that's the downside
of having a mother who never ages.

29
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,980
It must be something in these cigarettes.

30
00:01:46,064 --> 00:01:48,775
It doesn't hurt
that you guys are the judges.

31
00:01:49,984 --> 00:01:51,861
-They are?
-You guys are the judges?

32
00:01:55,323 --> 00:01:56,699
I knew this day would come.

33
00:01:57,575 --> 00:01:58,910
-Maybe it is time.
-[sighs]

34
00:01:59,327 --> 00:02:01,329
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, okay, uh...

35
00:02:01,412 --> 00:02:04,165
Kids, your mother and I have discussed it,

36
00:02:04,249 --> 00:02:07,502
and you're all old enough now
to actually impress us,

37
00:02:08,211 --> 00:02:09,170
so...

38
00:02:13,258 --> 00:02:14,801
...we're out of the running.

39
00:02:14,884 --> 00:02:17,345
[Lucille] But that means
you need to step up your efforts

40
00:02:17,428 --> 00:02:18,930
in the talent portion.

41
00:02:19,013 --> 00:02:20,515
I already know what I'm doing.

42
00:02:20,598 --> 00:02:22,392
And it can't just be push-ups.

43
00:02:22,684 --> 00:02:25,353
[stammering]
Yeah, it won't just be push-ups.

44
00:02:27,397 --> 00:02:29,482
[Lucille] So, good luck,
everyone, in the pageant.

45
00:02:29,566 --> 00:02:31,860
I'm sure you'll all be thin
by Thursday, Lindsay.

46
00:02:31,943 --> 00:02:34,696
-[George Sr.] Out you go.
-Although, not so fast.

47
00:02:34,779 --> 00:02:37,657
You have to wait
until your brother Buster's hooked up.

48
00:02:38,074 --> 00:02:40,660
Oh, come on.
He still has to wear that dog collar?

49
00:02:40,952 --> 00:02:42,412
It's not a dog collar.

50
00:02:42,871 --> 00:02:44,956
-It's Buster's Gentleman Collar.
-Gentleman Collar.

51
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:46,541
And he barely even knows it's there.

52
00:02:46,916 --> 00:02:48,334
[Buster] Yeah, I barely know it's...

53
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:51,129
-[grunts]
-[chuckles]

54
00:02:51,212 --> 00:02:53,423
Well, he's grown a little.

55
00:02:53,506 --> 00:02:55,884
[Michael] Hey, wait.
You're in your suits already?

56
00:02:55,967 --> 00:02:59,053
I thought you were gonna wait for me
before you went swimming.

57
00:03:00,138 --> 00:03:02,765
It's not my fault
you're so greedy for a paycheck.

58
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:04,225
I was covering your shift.

59
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:07,270
-Oh, yeah. Pay up.
-[Michael] Too late.

60
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:10,231
I already spent your pay on this.

61
00:03:14,485 --> 00:03:15,862
[music swells]

62
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:22,911
You bought me a dorky, lame, stupid,

63
00:03:23,161 --> 00:03:24,412
gay magic kit?

64
00:03:24,954 --> 00:03:27,040
{\an8}What? No. This is for me.

65
00:03:27,123 --> 00:03:29,250
I got it for the Mr. Bluth Talent Pageant.

66
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:31,211
{\an8}This is gonna be my talent.

67
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:35,006
Does it come with that bird?

68
00:03:35,381 --> 00:03:37,675
{\an8}No, I gotta get a bird.
But I'll get a bird.

69
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:40,136
{\an8}[Buster] Can I see?
[grunts] Almost there...

70
00:03:40,762 --> 00:03:42,972
[Michael]
Didn't Buster used to get past the window?

71
00:03:43,348 --> 00:03:45,058
[Gob] Mom tightened it
when he tried to put

72
00:03:45,141 --> 00:03:46,726
that starfish in his mouth.

73
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:49,938
Yeah, but he's had a good summer.
He's made friends.

74
00:03:51,189 --> 00:03:53,191
Actually, Mother made the friend for me.

75
00:03:53,691 --> 00:03:56,778
So I named it after her: Lucille Ball.

76
00:03:58,738 --> 00:04:01,157
Is anybody else worried she's ruining us?

77
00:04:05,328 --> 00:04:07,247
[Buster] Take that back!
You take that back!

78
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:09,999
-We're normal! We're normal!
-[Gob] Okay. Down, down.

79
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:12,335
-[Michael] Easy, Buster. Easy, boy.
-[Lindsay] Sit.

80
00:04:14,462 --> 00:04:16,089
Okay, well, you guys wait for me.

81
00:04:16,172 --> 00:04:17,590
I'm gonna go change into my suit.

82
00:04:17,674 --> 00:04:20,677
I would say wait for me,
but it might be a couple of years.

83
00:04:22,845 --> 00:04:24,264
Hey, uh, Michael...

84
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:28,017
[sighs]
I think Buster wants to go take a swim.

85
00:04:29,811 --> 00:04:31,020
[Buster] I do!

86
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:33,064
I've never even got my suit wet
from the outside.

87
00:04:33,147 --> 00:04:35,275
And I'm looking to turn that around,
buddy.

88
00:04:35,358 --> 00:04:37,860
[Michael] If you're talking
about Buster going into the ocean,

89
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:39,404
that is a terrible idea.

90
00:04:39,862 --> 00:04:42,490
Besides,
Mom puts that stupid collar on him

91
00:04:42,573 --> 00:04:44,450
every time he puts on his bathing suit.

92
00:04:44,659 --> 00:04:46,035
No. Not every time.

93
00:04:46,452 --> 00:04:48,371
He doesn't wear it
during the swimsuit competition

94
00:04:48,454 --> 00:04:49,956
of the Mr. Bluth Pageant.

95
00:04:50,039 --> 00:04:51,040
Sit.

96
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:54,127
By the way, guess who it turns out
the judges really are?

97
00:04:55,086 --> 00:04:56,212
It's not Mom and Dad?

98
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:00,049
Magic is for girls.

99
00:05:00,717 --> 00:05:02,552
And your bird's gonna die, Michael.

100
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:07,807
And when it does, it'll go back to...
whence it came.

101
00:05:08,433 --> 00:05:09,309
[sighs]

102
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,228
Back to whence it came.

{\an8}<i>It seems the Bluth Family...</i>

120
00:05:57,815 --> 00:05:59,442
{\an8}[Ron] <i>And the family found themselves</i>

when you're rich<i> </i>and white in America.

125
00:06:08,993 --> 00:06:10,370
{\an8}You happen to be caught on video,

126
00:06:10,453 --> 00:06:13,956
{\an8}dumping some large person-type thing
into the bay,

127
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:16,000
{\an8}and nobody thinks, "I wonder how long

128
00:06:16,084 --> 00:06:18,169
{\an8}that guy has been working
for the real killer?"

129
00:06:18,252 --> 00:06:21,255
{\an8}Yeah, and they jumped right
to "He's the killer,"

130
00:06:21,339 --> 00:06:22,632
{\an8}and then don't think to add:

131
00:06:22,715 --> 00:06:25,301
{\an8}"but it's nice he's giving
the help the night off."

132
00:06:25,635 --> 00:06:28,179
{\an8}No, they're jealous. They are jealous.

133
00:06:28,262 --> 00:06:31,474
{\an8}And they won't stop
until one of us is a murderer.

134
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:32,892
{\an8}Today, it's Buster.

135
00:06:33,142 --> 00:06:35,561
{\an8}Tomorrow-- No, I guess it'll stop today.

136
00:06:35,645 --> 00:06:37,438
{\an8}-Today's the last day.
-[George Sr.] Come on.

137
00:06:37,522 --> 00:06:39,065
{\an8}Let's all get on the same side here.

138
00:06:39,148 --> 00:06:40,775
{\an8}We need to be all together on this.

139
00:06:40,858 --> 00:06:42,902
{\an8}Yeah, I-- I think that's a wonderful idea.

140
00:06:43,277 --> 00:06:46,447
{\an8}And really,
we're just asking this Asian gentleman

141
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:48,491
{\an8}and his wife...?

142
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:50,743
To move over
to that group of chairs there,

143
00:06:51,035 --> 00:06:52,787
freeing up the end seat,

144
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:54,872
which I would love
to take a shot at sitting in.

145
00:06:54,956 --> 00:06:57,333
[Michael] Okay, it is not great news.

146
00:06:57,417 --> 00:06:58,376
[Tobias] Sorry.

147
00:06:58,459 --> 00:06:59,627
To finish the thought,

148
00:07:00,044 --> 00:07:02,422
that would free up this whole area
of seats for us.

149
00:07:02,505 --> 00:07:04,715
From the "If You See Something,
Say Something" poster

150
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:07,176
-to the payphone.
-Tobias, please.

151
00:07:07,635 --> 00:07:10,721
-What did you find out?
-My friend spoke to the DA's office,

152
00:07:10,805 --> 00:07:13,182
and my lawyers were able
to reduce my sentence

153
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:15,059
to time served. Bad news?

154
00:07:15,143 --> 00:07:18,062
I can't spend any time
with anybody under 25.

155
00:07:18,146 --> 00:07:19,522
About Buster.

156
00:07:20,606 --> 00:07:24,986
And... they officially charged him
with murder. First degree.

157
00:07:25,069 --> 00:07:26,362
-Mm...
-[Lucille] First degree?

158
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:29,073
-They don't even have a body.
-[Michael] Yes,

159
00:07:29,157 --> 00:07:31,159
but they have his fingerprints
and her blood

160
00:07:31,242 --> 00:07:33,870
all over the stair car, which was supposed
to be missing in Mexico.

161
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:36,414
[Ron] <i>In fact,</i>
<i>it was a picture of the stair car</i>

167

[Ron] <i>But who, after hearing news</i>

-What is that?
-[Ron] <i>It was only after doing so</i>

187
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:40,811

-Son of a bitch!
-[Ron] <i>In fairness to him,</i>

197
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:06,462
<i>it had taken him a super long time to get</i>

198
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:09,757

<i>to walk, like, a mile from.</i>

199
00:09:10,341 --> 00:09:13,219
[Michael] <i>Unfortunately,</i>
<i>someone tampered with the evidence.</i>

200
00:09:13,302 --> 00:09:15,471
But, look, even without it,
they still have the video

201
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:18,015
of him dumping something
in the bay that night.

202
00:09:18,307 --> 00:09:21,060
And-- And did he say
what it was that he dumped?

203
00:09:21,811 --> 00:09:24,272
Or who gave him whatever
what it was that he dumped?

204
00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:27,066
Or where that guy,
not the first guy but the second guy

205
00:09:27,149 --> 00:09:28,985
who gave him what he dumped,

206
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:31,821
got... what it was that he dumped?

207
00:09:31,904 --> 00:09:33,197
[Barry chuckles] Not this time.

208
00:09:33,281 --> 00:09:35,575
No, we-- we didn't have him say anything.

209
00:09:36,158 --> 00:09:39,120
I said, "Don't say a word.
Put on your poker face."

210
00:09:39,203 --> 00:09:41,122
[Ron] <i>Although Buster's poker face</i>

211
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:44,917
<i>didn't really make him look</i>
<i>like less of a murderer.</i>

212
00:09:45,501 --> 00:09:46,627
-[Barry] Poker face.
-[laughs]

[Lucille] <i>How could this be happening?</i>

215
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:53,217
Buster couldn't have done this.
I raised him totally by the book.

216
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:55,469
Mom, you had him on a leash
until he was six.

217
00:09:55,553 --> 00:09:57,680
[Lucille] Well,
if that leash screwed him up so badly,

218
00:09:58,180 --> 00:09:59,890
why does he still want to wear it?

219
00:09:59,974 --> 00:10:02,643
Guys, it's not time
to play the blame game, okay?

220
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:05,062
Even though they do say, in most cases,

221
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:07,481
something happens in childhood
and, usually, the person

222
00:10:07,565 --> 00:10:09,191
that raises them is to blame.

223
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:11,152
-But that's experts.
-[Lucille] I see.

224
00:10:11,235 --> 00:10:13,446
Don't you try to pin this on Lupe.

225
00:10:13,529 --> 00:10:15,573
She had her own family to raise, too.

226
00:10:15,656 --> 00:10:17,825
[Michael] Boy,
Mom brings up a very good point.

227
00:10:17,908 --> 00:10:20,369
No one should say anything publicly
about this.

228
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:22,622
-I should speak for the family.
-[Tobias scoffs]

229
00:10:23,247 --> 00:10:24,624
-You?
-[Michael] Mm-hmm.

230
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:26,709
-Who said it should be you?
-[Michael] Well,

231
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:28,586
I'm in the family,
and it's gonna be crazy.

232
00:10:28,669 --> 00:10:30,254
It's gonna be a media circus, Tobias.

233
00:10:30,546 --> 00:10:32,632
Then I should be its ringmaster.

234
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:36,093
[Ron] <i>In fact, Tobias would've taken</i>
<i>any job at that moment,</i>

235
00:10:36,177 --> 00:10:40,514

239
00:10:55,696 --> 00:10:57,156
Who did that? Who did that?

240
00:10:57,239 --> 00:10:58,866
-I was trying to be funny.
-[Tobias] Yeah?

241
00:10:58,949 --> 00:11:01,077
How 'bout I put your head
through this glass table?

242
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,578
How funny would that be, young man?

243
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:03,704
Oh, try it, Dad!

244
00:11:03,788 --> 00:11:05,331
I would so [bleep] love that!

245
00:11:05,414 --> 00:11:07,708
-I did not raise you to say the F-word!
-Everybody's tired!

246
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:10,294
We've all had
too much pain medication.

247
00:11:10,378 --> 00:11:12,171
[Maeby] There were six.
There were six in here.

248
00:11:12,588 --> 00:11:14,006
Who the [bleep] took 'em?

249
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:15,925
-Why would you take these?
-I didn't take 'em!

250
00:11:16,008 --> 00:11:17,885
-How dare you, young lady!
-Hey, stop yelling!

251
00:11:18,135 --> 00:11:20,221
-I hate it when you guys fight!
-I've had enough of all

252
00:11:20,304 --> 00:11:22,264
-of you guys. Hey.
-I've had enough of you.

253

[Tobias] <i>Someone from this family needs</i>

to speak for Buster.

258
00:11:37,613 --> 00:11:39,865
Who is Buster Bluth?

259
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:41,617
A young, one-armed,

260
00:11:41,992 --> 00:11:45,705
Iraq War vet suffering from PTSD,

261
00:11:45,788 --> 00:11:48,582
raised by a young mother
who had him at 17,

262
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:50,251
whose only flaw was that...

263
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:53,295
she loved him... too much.

264
00:11:53,671 --> 00:11:55,881
Actually, I was 37.

265
00:11:55,965 --> 00:11:57,425
Well, no one would believe that.

266
00:11:57,925 --> 00:12:00,678
-You're hired.
-[Michael] No, you're not. Mom,

267
00:12:00,761 --> 00:12:02,471
-I'll handle this.
-[Lucille] Oh, Michael,

268
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:05,725
let's be honest. Every time
you handle things, they're mishandled.

269
00:12:05,808 --> 00:12:07,977
Yeah, your mom's right. I mean, lately,

270
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:09,562
you're just doing everything badly.

271
00:12:09,645 --> 00:12:12,356
-Yeah, Dad, nail his ass.
-[Tobias chuckles] I'll pile on

272
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,024
to nailing that ass, Dad.

273
00:12:14,108 --> 00:12:16,902
S... So, now that we've gotten

274
00:12:16,986 --> 00:12:19,864
Tobias completely ruled out as ringmaster,

275
00:12:19,947 --> 00:12:23,242
maybe we can talk about Buster
and maybe getting him a lawyer.

276
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:25,119
Oh! I should have led with this.

277
00:12:25,202 --> 00:12:26,495
I have been officially disbarred.

278
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:28,122
I can't handle Buster's case

279
00:12:28,205 --> 00:12:30,374
or anybody under 25.

280
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:32,960
Saves me an awkward conversation.

281
00:12:33,043 --> 00:12:35,921
I think we need to get Buster
the best criminal lawyer available.

-Looking for the best?
-Yeah.

283

Well, if you're looking for the best,
there is only one group to go to.

{\an8}<i>There was Anita Bramwell,</i>

{\an8}<i>as he was clumsy on the dance floor.</i>

299

{\an8}<i>and a country club membership</i>
<i>from his parents.</i>

305

{\an8}<i>But he made it to the top of the list</i>

306
00:13:29,683 --> 00:13:31,769
{\an8}<i>by being just that good.</i>

307
00:13:31,852 --> 00:13:33,896
<i>And hailing</i>

those other guys?

331

-Fakeblock's got nothing to do with this.
-Thanks, Michael.

332
00:14:31,829 --> 00:14:34,707
That's right.
Because when we sell Fakeblock,

333
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:36,750
we give the money right back
to the Chinese

334
00:14:36,834 --> 00:14:38,377
before they get angrier.

335
00:14:38,794 --> 00:14:39,879
Angrier?

336
00:14:39,962 --> 00:14:42,214
I didn't tell you,
but they left a message

337
00:14:42,298 --> 00:14:45,009
saying that they hope their gift
was enough to...

338
00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:47,261
"get us back on our feet."

339
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:49,972

It was very direct.

"I'll chop this off, I'll chop that off."

346
00:15:05,821 --> 00:15:07,990

348

we spent the money.

349

We're gonna have to sell Fakeblock,
so we can find a way to build the wall.

350

okay?

351
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:20,794

to pay for these great lawyers, all right?

352

-A little.
-You can't sell a company a little.

My dad was gonna invest
in your company.

I was gonna invest in your company.

407
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:34,595
Then, suddenly,
you go behind my back and have sold it.

408
00:17:34,678 --> 00:17:36,764
-You clearly don't trust me.
-I do trust you.

00:20:54,753 --> 00:20:55,837
Nine rings?

493
00:20:56,546 --> 00:20:57,714
Are you at Sudden Valley?

494
00:20:57,798 --> 00:20:59,341
Yes, uh, I believe you were told,

495
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:02,928
<i>although perhaps someone foolishly left</i>
<i>a message for you at work.</i>

496
00:21:03,011 --> 00:21:04,179
<i>It's a business event.</i>

497
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:05,973
-[Michael] Beautiful day.
-The Bluth Company.

498
00:21:06,056 --> 00:21:06,890
[Gob] <i>On TV?</i>

499
00:21:07,224 --> 00:21:08,934
-Are you on TV?
-[Adhir] <i>A local channel</i>

500
00:21:09,017 --> 00:21:10,936
<i>is televising it, I believe.</i>

501
00:21:11,645 --> 00:21:13,230
<i>-Yes, there they are.</i>
-[applause on TV]

502
00:21:13,313 --> 00:21:14,940
-Okay.
-[Michael] <i>Absolutely great day.</i>

503
00:21:15,023 --> 00:21:16,525
Walk to the camera, okay?

504
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:19,653
-Walk to the camera quick, so I--
-[Adhir] <i>I don't feel comfortable...</i>

505
00:21:19,736 --> 00:21:22,322
I need you to comply
and walk over to the camera!

506
00:21:22,698 --> 00:21:25,242
Wow, this is perfect. Michael plans

507
00:21:25,409 --> 00:21:27,577
a little "work event" during the weekmid.

508
00:21:27,911 --> 00:21:29,621
Right? That's just... Look at me.

509
00:21:29,705 --> 00:21:31,373
-[Adhir] <i>I can't see you.</i>
-Comply!

510
00:21:31,456 --> 00:21:32,916
Look me in the eyes and tell me

511
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,043
that Michael didn't want me
to know about this

512
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:38,505
because I'm the president of Fakeblock.
It's why he planned it so early, isn't it?

513
00:21:38,588 --> 00:21:39,923
[Adhir] <i>Uh, Gob, really?</i>

514
00:21:40,007 --> 00:21:42,759
<i>In fairness,</i>
<i>it is a Thursday at twenty to four.</i>

515
00:21:42,843 --> 00:21:44,469
Exactly, and everyone knows

516
00:21:44,553 --> 00:21:46,888
the workday doesn't start
until nine to five.

517
00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:48,932
[Adhir sighs] <i>Look,</i>
<i>I need to get back to him.</i>

518
00:21:49,016 --> 00:21:50,559
<i>Michael's going to announce the wall.</i>

519
00:21:50,642 --> 00:21:53,437
Did he sell Fakeblock to build it?
Does George Michael know?

520
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,564
[Adhir] <i>No, I believe</i>
<i>he found a way around that.</i>

521
00:21:55,647 --> 00:21:56,898
Well, I'm gonna tell him.

522
00:21:56,982 --> 00:21:59,151
[Adhir] <i>It's a groundbreaking.</i>
<i>I wouldn't be concerned.</i>

523
00:21:59,234 --> 00:22:00,944
[laughing] A... a groundbreaking?

524
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:04,531
A groundbreaking?
[sobbing] Should... should... should...

525
00:22:04,614 --> 00:22:07,659
[Michael] <i>Let history not judge us</i>
<i>for the ideology, but rather...</i>

526
00:22:07,743 --> 00:22:09,786
the quality of its workmanship,

527
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:13,206
for we are just filling orders.

528
00:22:18,628 --> 00:22:20,130
[stammering] You want to...
You-- you...

529
00:22:20,213 --> 00:22:21,923
Should... should I? Should...?

530
00:22:22,007 --> 00:22:23,425
You want to see some...?

531
00:22:23,508 --> 00:22:25,260
You wanna see groundbreaking gay TV?

532
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:26,970
Don't start without me.

533
00:22:27,054 --> 00:22:29,014
-George Michael!
-[Adhir] <i>Okay, but we've started.</i>

534
00:22:29,097 --> 00:22:32,142
<i>-We're in the middle of... Hello?</i>
-[Michael] <i>In a modern world where there</i>

535
00:22:32,225 --> 00:22:33,602
are certainly more threats greater

536
00:22:33,685 --> 00:22:37,064
than a 34-year-old hard-working migrant
hoping

537
00:22:37,147 --> 00:22:38,982
to send money home to feed

538
00:22:39,066 --> 00:22:40,859
his wife and three young...

539
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:44,780
future rapists.

540
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:50,911
Of course,
I'm talking about the threat of cyber.

541
00:22:50,994 --> 00:22:52,412
And that is why the Bluth Company

542
00:22:52,496 --> 00:22:55,749
acquired a new partner
just for this project.

543
00:22:55,999 --> 00:22:57,793
Adhir. Thank you.

544
00:22:57,876 --> 00:22:59,753
-[crowd applauds] Wow!
-Look at that.

545
00:22:59,836 --> 00:23:02,214
Okay? Introducing...

546
00:23:02,756 --> 00:23:05,384
Fakeblock. We've purchased this company

547
00:23:05,467 --> 00:23:09,012
<i>solely in order to embed</i>
<i>its privacy technology...</i>

548
00:23:09,096 --> 00:23:12,182
-[George Michael] What the [bleep]?!
<i>-...into our state-of-the-art prototype</i>

549
00:23:12,265 --> 00:23:13,141
wall project.

550
00:23:14,476 --> 00:23:17,020
We meant to do this, folks,
so nobody was deceived.

551
00:23:17,104 --> 00:23:18,563
[chuckles]

552
00:23:21,733 --> 00:23:22,567
And that's it.

553
00:23:24,069 --> 00:23:25,404
[Ron] <i>And so, as Michael went</i>

554
00:23:25,487 --> 00:23:29,574
<i>to ceremonially break ground</i>
<i>to prove that Fakeblock could build</i>

555
00:23:29,658 --> 00:23:30,909
<i>an indestructible wall...</i>

556
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:32,369
To the wall!

557
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:35,455
May it bring us all... together.

558
00:23:35,872 --> 00:23:37,791
<i>...Gob kind of made the opposite.</i>

559
00:23:37,874 --> 00:23:40,460
[crowd exclaims]

560
00:23:44,506 --> 00:23:48,510
My name is Gob Bluth,
and as president of Fakeblock,

561
00:23:48,802 --> 00:23:50,554
I have an announcement!

562
00:23:50,846 --> 00:23:52,764
I'm building a wall!

563
00:23:54,057 --> 00:23:57,436
Come back for the unveiling
in two full weeks!

564
00:23:57,519 --> 00:24:00,147
[applause]

565
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:03,275
-Wow, that was spectacular.
-Couldn't have gone better.

566
00:24:03,358 --> 00:24:06,278
[George Sr.] It's great, Michael.
I mean, it placates the Chinese,

567
00:24:06,361 --> 00:24:09,281
and as long as cash comes in
from the software within the month...

568
00:24:09,364 --> 00:24:10,740
-Yeah.
-...we'll be able to pay

569
00:24:10,824 --> 00:24:13,118
the lawyers who are working
on Buster's murder charges.

570
00:24:14,286 --> 00:24:15,162
Come in close.

571
00:24:15,245 --> 00:24:17,247
[whispers] I think
I'm winning your mother back.

572
00:24:17,581 --> 00:24:19,332
I'm gonna stick it to her tonight.

573
00:24:19,499 --> 00:24:22,419
We couldn't be prouder, Michael.
And in his dreams.

574
00:24:22,502 --> 00:24:24,421
-Right.
-[Gob] Hey. Did you see that?

575
00:24:24,504 --> 00:24:26,089
Did you see what I did?
Did you see that?

576
00:24:26,173 --> 00:24:27,924
Yeah, yeah.

577
00:24:30,093 --> 00:24:31,386
I had a shovel for you.

578
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:34,681
No, it's okay. I wanted to come in hot,
make a show of it.

579
00:24:34,764 --> 00:24:37,601
God, did you see the look
on their faces?

580
00:24:38,518 --> 00:24:40,687
[Michael] Just when you said two weeks
to the unveiling.

581
00:24:40,770 --> 00:24:41,646
Right?

582
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:43,315
And when you turned
and went after them.

583
00:24:44,107 --> 00:24:46,568
[whispering] George Michael's coming
after you, by the way.

584
00:24:48,153 --> 00:24:49,613
-[George Michael] What was that?
-Hi.

585
00:24:49,696 --> 00:24:51,281
Why would you bring my company
into this?

586
00:24:51,364 --> 00:24:53,909
-[Michael] Yup. Listen.
-Now we have a contract to fulfill?

587
00:24:53,992 --> 00:24:57,787
I know that I told you you'd have time
to get the software all worked out,

588
00:24:57,871 --> 00:24:59,956
but it is looking like we're gonna need it
in a month.

589
00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:02,417
-A month?
-Yeah, I was hoping<i> </i>to stall for six,

590
00:25:02,501 --> 00:25:05,504
but your uncle announced an unveiling
in two weeks.

591
00:25:05,587 --> 00:25:08,548
The upside is, after this,
we're gonna be able to free up capital,

592
00:25:08,632 --> 00:25:09,633
get you some tech guys.

593
00:25:09,716 --> 00:25:11,718
I got some friends
in mapping I can talk to

594
00:25:11,801 --> 00:25:13,553
-when they come up for air.
-[George Michael] I can't do this.

595
00:25:13,637 --> 00:25:14,888
-You can't.
-[Michael] Well...

596
00:25:14,971 --> 00:25:16,264
Tell them it's off. Go up there

597
00:25:16,348 --> 00:25:18,308
-and tell them it's off.
-That's the other thing.

598
00:25:18,391 --> 00:25:20,143
I mean, there is no more...

599
00:25:20,435 --> 00:25:22,896
"up there," um, and-- and-- and look, I...

600
00:25:22,979 --> 00:25:24,606
I <i>cannot </i>call it off.

601
00:25:24,689 --> 00:25:25,982
But I'm the one on the line.

602
00:25:26,066 --> 00:25:28,360
I'm the only one who needs
to lose feet over this...

603
00:25:28,443 --> 00:25:29,402
<i>sleep </i>over this.

604
00:25:30,111 --> 00:25:31,821
You just need to make the software.

605
00:25:31,905 --> 00:25:33,365
I should have told you, but,

606
00:25:34,032 --> 00:25:35,659
it just seemed like something

607
00:25:35,742 --> 00:25:38,286
that you might have
a knee-jerk overreaction to.

608
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:41,331
[chuckles] I can tell you what
your grandmother would do.

609
00:25:41,414 --> 00:25:42,457
-Um--
-You're fired.

610
00:25:42,999 --> 00:25:44,876
[Michael] She does go right there,
but obviously

611
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,628
I don't think that <i>you </i>would go that far.

612
00:25:46,711 --> 00:25:48,088

-so you <i>could </i>fire me.
