male narrator: NOW THE STORY 
OF A WEALTHY FAMILY

2
00:00:03,086 --> 00:00:04,212
WHO LOST EVERYTHING

3
00:00:04,212 --> 00:00:06,297
AND THE ONE SON 
WHO HAD NO CHOICE

4
00:00:06,297 --> 00:00:09,300
BUT TO KEEP THEM ALL TOGETHER.

5
00:00:13,846 --> 00:00:16,849
IT'S "ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT."

6
00:00:19,269 --> 00:00:20,895
MICHAEL BLUTH ARRIVED AT WORK

7
00:00:20,895 --> 00:00:24,274
TO FIND HIS BROTHER ADJUSTING 
TO HIS NEW JOB AS PRESIDENT.

8
00:00:24,274 --> 00:00:25,275
- WHAT HAVE YOU GOT THERE?

9
00:00:25,275 --> 00:00:29,320
"DON'T BE AFRAID 
TO MAKE A MI--"

10
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:31,322
- I'M NOT GONNA 
BEAT MYSELF UP OVER THAT.

11
00:00:31,322 --> 00:00:32,448
- OH. 
IT WORKS.

12
00:00:32,448 --> 00:00:34,034
SO, I WROTE YOUR 
"MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT"

13
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:35,660
ON THE SHAREHOLDERS' STATEMENT.

14
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:37,412
STARLA'S MAKING COPIES.

15
00:00:37,412 --> 00:00:39,747
- DID I TELL YOU THAT SHE'D 
MAKE A GREAT SECRETARY?

16
00:00:39,747 --> 00:00:42,083
- YEAH, I'M NOT SO SURE THAT 
HIRING HER WASN'T A MISTAKE.

17
00:00:42,083 --> 00:00:43,626
- AND I'M NOT AFRAID 
TO MAKE MISTAKES.

18
00:00:43,626 --> 00:00:45,295
OR HAVE YOU FORGOTTEN 
THIS LITTLE--

19
00:00:45,295 --> 00:00:46,629
DAMN IT!

20
00:00:46,629 --> 00:00:47,797
MY LEGS ARE SO POWERFUL.

21
00:00:47,797 --> 00:00:49,465
- UH, SO I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT 
WANT TO READ IT,

22
00:00:49,465 --> 00:00:51,384
SEEING AS HOW YOU ARE 
THE PRESIDENT NOW,

23
00:00:51,384 --> 00:00:53,052
EVEN THOUGH 
IT'S JUST A TITLE.

24
00:00:53,052 --> 00:00:54,845
- UH, RIGHT. 
YES.

25
00:00:54,845 --> 00:00:58,058
WELL, WE SHOULD "CIRCUMVRENT" 
UNION PENALTIES.

26
00:00:58,058 --> 00:00:59,350
"CIRCUMVERATE."

27
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:01,061
- CIRCUMVENT. 
MEANS TO GO AROUND.

28
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:02,395
- THE OLD REACH AROUND.

29
00:01:02,395 --> 00:01:03,396
- TRUST ME.

30
00:01:03,396 --> 00:01:05,273
THIS MAKES YOU 
LOOK LIKE A LEADER, OKAY?

31
00:01:05,273 --> 00:01:09,069
- I DON'T THINK THAT 
I NEED ANY HELP WITH THAT.

32
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:11,696
[bleep] IT. 
JUST LEAVE IT WHERE IT IS.

33
00:01:11,696 --> 00:01:15,241
- NOW, IF YOU JUST FLIP-- 
- HERE ARE THE COPIES.

34
00:01:15,241 --> 00:01:18,786
- OH, HEY, THESE ARE-- 
THESE ARE VERY SMALL.

35
00:01:18,786 --> 00:01:20,746
- WHEN YOU SAID YOU WANTED 
PHOTOCOPIES,

36
00:01:20,746 --> 00:01:23,291
I THOUGHT THAT YOU MEANT YOU 
WANTED THEM ON A PHOTO PRINTER.

37
00:01:23,291 --> 00:01:24,292
- TELL YOU WHAT.

38
00:01:24,292 --> 00:01:26,836
FROM NOW ON, WE'RE GONNA USE 
JUST THE BIG PRINTER.

39
00:01:26,836 --> 00:01:30,381
- OKAY. 
YOU'RE A PERFECTIONIST.

40
00:01:30,381 --> 00:01:32,258
FLASHES OF QUINCY.

WITH MUSIC LEGEND QUINCY JONES.

43
00:01:36,512 --> 00:01:37,930
- MR. PRESIDENT, 
I'M GONNA GO LOOK INTO

44
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:39,724
SOME LEGOLAND TICKETS 
FOR THE WEEKEND.

45
00:01:39,724 --> 00:01:40,933
- COOL. 
LET'S DO IT.

46
00:01:40,933 --> 00:01:43,603
- ACTUALLY, 
I JUST MEANT ME AND MY SON.

47
00:01:43,603 --> 00:01:45,896
- ISN'T HE A LITTLE OLD 
FOR THAT?

48
00:01:45,896 --> 00:01:47,022
- NO.

49
00:01:47,022 --> 00:01:49,234
SORRY, I'VE BEEN LOOKING TO GET 
SOME ALONE TIME WITH HIM,

50
00:01:49,234 --> 00:01:50,985
AND IT JUST HASN'T SEEMED 
TO WORK OUT LATELY.

51
00:01:50,985 --> 00:01:51,986
- NO PROBLEM.

52
00:01:51,986 --> 00:01:54,197
I'LL JUST CALL UP 
SOME OF MY FRIENDS.

53
00:01:54,197 --> 00:01:55,698
- [chuckles]

54
00:01:55,698 --> 00:01:58,951
- WHAT? 
- WHAT FRIENDS?

55
00:01:58,951 --> 00:02:00,536
- I'VE GOT FRIENDS, MICHAEL.

56
00:02:00,536 --> 00:02:02,163
I JUST DON'T 
TALK TO THEM BECAUSE

57
00:02:02,163 --> 00:02:04,224
I WORK ALL THE TIME.

58
00:02:09,504 --> 00:02:13,966
I THINK THE PLANT LADY'S 
WEARING A THONG.

59
00:02:13,966 --> 00:02:16,469
- MICHAEL, 
THIS IS YOUR OFFICE NOW?

60
00:02:16,469 --> 00:02:17,678
- YEAH. 
WELL, IT'S TEMPORARY.

61
00:02:17,678 --> 00:02:19,805
WE'VE GOT TO MAKE SURE GOB 
LOOKS LIKE HE'S IN CHARGE.

62
00:02:19,805 --> 00:02:23,559
- OH, PLEASE, ALLOW ME. 
I'LL JUST "CIRCUMVRENT" YOU.

63
00:02:23,559 --> 00:02:26,146
- LET'S MAKE SURE WE DON'T 
GIVE HIM ANY REAL POWER.

64
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:27,147
- MMM.

65
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:30,941
- SO, I GOT A CALL TODAY FROM 
GENE PARMESAN, OUR PRIVATE EYE.

66
00:02:30,941 --> 00:02:32,652
- HE SAID HE FOUND 
SOMETHING BIG.

67
00:02:32,652 --> 00:02:33,819
- WE HAVE A PRIVATE EYE, HUH?

68
00:02:33,819 --> 00:02:35,238
- OH, I HIRED HIM 
A HUNDRED YEARS AGO

69
00:02:35,238 --> 00:02:37,198
TO FIND OUT IF YOUR FATHER 
WAS CHEATING ON ME.

70
00:02:37,198 --> 00:02:38,533
HE NEVER DID FIND ANYTHING.

71
00:02:38,533 --> 00:02:41,244
- WELL, HE CAN'T BE 
VERY GOOD, THEN.

72
00:02:41,244 --> 00:02:42,245
UH, WHAT DID HE FIND?

73
00:02:42,245 --> 00:02:44,247
- HE SAID HE WANTED TO 
TELL US IN PERSON.

74
00:02:44,247 --> 00:02:45,248
- [in an Italian accent] 
DON'T GET UP.

75
00:02:45,248 --> 00:02:47,625
I JUST A-FIND-A 
THE SUPPLIES BECAUSE I'M A--

76
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:49,168
[drops accent] 
PRIVATE DETECTIVE.

77
00:02:49,168 --> 00:02:51,587
GENE PARMESAN. 
HOW ARE YOU DOING?

78
00:02:51,587 --> 00:02:53,798
- [shrieks] GENE! 
OH, GENE!

79
00:02:53,798 --> 00:02:55,425
ISN'T HE THE BEST?

80
00:02:55,425 --> 00:02:57,009
narrator: 
GENE WAS FAR FROM THE BEST.

81
00:02:57,009 --> 00:02:58,719
- THAT'S VERY IMPRESSIVE. 
- THANK YOU.

82
00:02:58,719 --> 00:03:01,096
- WHAT DID YOU FIND? 
- OH, NOTHING.

83
00:03:01,096 --> 00:03:03,057
JUST YOUR FATHER'S GETAWAY CAR.

84
00:03:03,057 --> 00:03:04,267
- YOU'RE KIDDING.

85
00:03:04,267 --> 00:03:05,476
narrator: 
MICHAEL'S FATHER HAD USED

86
00:03:05,476 --> 00:03:08,521
THE FAMILY STAIRWAY 
VEHICLE TO ESCAPE FROM PRISON.

87
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:10,481
- IF I COULD FIND DAD, 
I'D BE OFF THE HOOK.

88
00:03:10,481 --> 00:03:11,524
I COULD BE PRESIDENT AGAIN.

89
00:03:11,524 --> 00:03:14,277
WHERE IS IT? 
- MEXICO.

90
00:03:14,277 --> 00:03:19,198
YOU GET THE COUNTRY FOR FREE. 
THE CITY--THAT'S GONNA COST YOU.

91
00:03:19,198 --> 00:03:21,242
[fire alarm beeping]

92
00:03:21,242 --> 00:03:24,370
- IT'S A $200 FINE. 
- OH!

93
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:26,289
- I FEEL LIKE SUCH AN-- 
[bleep]

94
00:03:26,289 --> 00:03:28,165
THE CAR IS 
IN A TOWN CALLED ENCANTA.

95
00:03:28,165 --> 00:03:29,917
IF YOU THINK THAT'S 
WORTH MORE THAN $200,

96
00:03:29,917 --> 00:03:31,126
THEN I'D REALLY APPRECIATE IT.

97
00:03:31,126 --> 00:03:32,295
- ALL RIGHT, HERE.

98
00:03:32,295 --> 00:03:34,880
- I'M NOT EVEN GONNA COUNT IT.

99
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:36,131
- YOU CAN LEAVE TOMORROW

100
00:03:36,131 --> 00:03:38,218
AFTER MY GOING-AWAY PARTY 
FOR BUSTER.

101
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:40,636
I STILL CAN'T BELIEVE 
HE'S GOING INTO THE ARMY.

102
00:03:40,636 --> 00:03:42,388
YOU KNOW, HE'S DOING IT 
JUST TO SPITE ME.

103
00:03:42,388 --> 00:03:43,931
- THEN WHY ARE YOU 
THROWING HIM A PARTY?

104
00:03:43,931 --> 00:03:45,308
- JUST TO SPITE HIM.

105
00:03:45,308 --> 00:03:47,852
- YOU GUYS HAVE SUCH 
A HEALTHY THING GOING.

106
00:03:47,852 --> 00:03:49,437
OKAY, I'LL GO TO YOUR PARTY, 
AND THEN I'LL GO TO MEXICO.

107
00:03:49,437 --> 00:03:51,314
I GUESS THAT'LL BE 
MY QUALITY TIME WITH MY SON.

108
00:03:51,314 --> 00:03:52,773
- MEXICO?

109
00:03:52,773 --> 00:03:55,985
- YEAH, MOM'S P.I. 
FOUND THE STAIR CAR DOWN THERE.

110
00:03:55,985 --> 00:03:57,362
- GENE PARMESAN?

111
00:03:57,362 --> 00:03:58,529
- RIGHT HERE.

112
00:03:58,529 --> 00:04:00,323
- [shrieks]

113
00:04:00,323 --> 00:04:03,158
- I COUNTED IT. 
COME ON.

114
00:04:03,158 --> 00:04:05,119
narrator: AND THAT'S 
WHEN GOB BECAME SUSPICIOUS

115
00:04:05,119 --> 00:04:07,079
THAT MICHAEL 
HAD ONLY MADE HIM PRESIDENT

116
00:04:07,079 --> 00:04:09,499
TO STICK HIM 
WITH THE FAILING BUSINESS,

117
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:12,001
WHILE MICHAEL HIMSELF 
ESCAPED TO MEXICO

118
00:04:12,001 --> 00:04:13,836
TO BE WITH HIS FATHER.

119
00:04:13,836 --> 00:04:16,464
SO, INSPIRED BY HIS MOTHER'S 
PRIVATE DETECTIVE...

120
00:04:16,464 --> 00:04:17,465
- "ICE."

121
00:04:17,465 --> 00:04:18,716
narrator: 
HE DECIDED TO HIRE SOMEONE

122
00:04:18,716 --> 00:04:20,343
TO KEEP AN EYE 
ON HIS BROTHER.

123
00:04:20,343 --> 00:04:21,511
- I THINK I MIGHT HAVE SOMEONE

124
00:04:21,511 --> 00:04:24,889
WHO'S GOING TO 
"CIRSUMVRENT" THE LAW.

125
00:04:24,889 --> 00:04:26,140
narrator: 
AND MICHAEL RETURNED HOME

126
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:27,850
EAGER TO TELL HIS SON 
OF THEIR TRIP.

127
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:29,519
- GEORGE MICHAEL, 
WHAT DO YOU SAY YOU AND I

128
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:31,562
TAKE A LITTLE ROAD TRIP 
DOWN TO MEXICO TOMORROW

129
00:04:31,562 --> 00:04:32,980
RIGHT AFTER BUSTER'S PARTY?

130
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:34,982
- OH, I CAN'T. 
I'M MEETING ANN.

131
00:04:34,982 --> 00:04:37,234
- WHO? 
- ANN.

132
00:04:37,234 --> 00:04:38,403
HERE, YOU TOOK 
THIS PICTURE OF US

133
00:04:38,403 --> 00:04:41,447
IN FRONT OF THAT BAGEL PLACE 
BEFORE IT WAS BURNED DOWN.

134
00:04:41,447 --> 00:04:44,116
- I GUESS I THOUGHT 
SHE WAS WITH ANOTHER FAMILY.

135
00:04:44,116 --> 00:04:46,702
- SHE'S KIND OF MY GIRLFRIEND.

136
00:04:46,702 --> 00:04:49,121
- HER? 
- DO YOU NOT LIKE HER?

137
00:04:49,121 --> 00:04:50,290
- I DON'T KNOW HER. 
YOU KNOW?

138
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:51,791
IT'S LIKE YOU SPEND 
ALL YOUR TIME WITH HER.

139
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:55,044
IT'S LIKE YOU'RE HOGGIN' HER-- 
LIKE YOU'RE A LITTLE ANN HOG.

140
00:04:55,044 --> 00:04:56,962
OKAY? 
DON'T BE SUCH AN ANN HOG.

141
00:04:56,962 --> 00:04:58,298
BUT WE'RE GONNA GO TO MEXICO.

142
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:00,425
TRY TO FIND POP-POP. 
IT'LL BE AN ADVENTURE.

143
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:02,760
- WELL.

144
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,595
- AND 8:01. 
CURTAIN HAS RISEN.

145
00:05:04,595 --> 00:05:05,596
[chuckles]

146
00:05:05,596 --> 00:05:06,764
- HEY, TOBIAS, I WAS WONDERING

147
00:05:06,764 --> 00:05:09,392
IF YOU WERE AVAILABLE TOMORROW 
TO GO DOWN TO MEXICO.

148
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:10,851
I NEED TWO DRIVERS.

149
00:05:10,851 --> 00:05:12,728
- ALAS, 
I HAVE TWO SHOWS TOMORROW

150
00:05:12,728 --> 00:05:14,855
WHERE I'M ON STANDBY 
FOR THE BLUE MAN GROUP.

151
00:05:14,855 --> 00:05:16,857
MIGHT AS WELL 
KEEP THIS MAKEUP ON

152
00:05:16,857 --> 00:05:19,234
SINCE IT TAKES 
SO [bleep] LONG TO GET OFF.

153
00:05:19,234 --> 00:05:20,861
- HMM. 
LINDSAY, WHAT ABOUT YOU?

154
00:05:20,861 --> 00:05:23,614
- UH, CAN'T. 
I HAVE A BIG DATE TOMORROW.

155
00:05:23,614 --> 00:05:25,282
- YOU KNOW, THIS OPEN MARRIAGE 
IS RIDICULOUS.

156
00:05:25,282 --> 00:05:26,451
SOMEBODY'S GONNA GET HURT.

157
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:27,577
- THE IMPORTANT THING IS

158
00:05:27,577 --> 00:05:30,580
THAT YOU GUYS DON'T 
LOSE FOCUS ON YOURSELVES.

159
00:05:32,998 --> 00:05:35,084
- YOU KNOW, FIRST OF ALL, 
WE ARE DOING THIS FOR HER.

160
00:05:35,084 --> 00:05:36,085
OKAY?

161
00:05:36,085 --> 00:05:37,878
BECAUSE NEITHER ONE OF US 
WANTS TO GET DIVORCED.

162
00:05:37,878 --> 00:05:39,088
AND "SECOND-OF-LY,"

163
00:05:39,088 --> 00:05:41,173
I KNOW YOU'RE THE BIG 
MARRIAGE EXPERT--

164
00:05:41,173 --> 00:05:43,551
OH, I'M SORRY. 
I FORGOT.

165
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:46,303
YOUR WIFE IS DEAD. 
[chuckles]

166
00:05:48,973 --> 00:05:51,642
I'M SORRY, 
THAT WAS 100% INAPPROPRIATE,

167
00:05:51,642 --> 00:05:53,394
AND I DO APOLOGIZE PROFUSELY.

168
00:05:53,394 --> 00:05:56,856
I'M--OH.

169
00:05:56,856 --> 00:05:58,691
- OKAY, LOOK. 
I DON'T HAVE A DATE TOMORROW.

170
00:05:58,691 --> 00:06:00,985
BUT WHY CAN'T YOU ASK 
GOB TO GO WITH YOU?

171
00:06:00,985 --> 00:06:03,488
narrator: MICHAEL AND GOB 
HAD BEEN TO MEXICO ONCE BEFORE.

172
00:06:03,488 --> 00:06:04,739
- CHICLET? 
CHICLET?

173
00:06:04,739 --> 00:06:06,574
- YOU'RE THE CHICLET! 
NOT ME!

174
00:06:06,574 --> 00:06:07,575
[clucking]

175
00:06:07,575 --> 00:06:09,452
narrator: UNFORTUNATELY, 
IN MEXICAN CULTURE,

176
00:06:09,452 --> 00:06:13,456
THIS WAS A MUCH MORE 
INFLAMMATORY GESTURE.

177
00:06:19,587 --> 00:06:21,839
- [clucking] 
- HEY, HEY.

178
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:24,717
I JUST THINK YOU AND I 
WOULD HAVE A LOT MORE FUN.

179
00:06:24,717 --> 00:06:25,968
PLUS, YOU CAN BRING MAEBY.

180
00:06:25,968 --> 00:06:28,137
- YOU KNOW, 
I'VE SENSED HER FEELING

181
00:06:28,137 --> 00:06:30,806
A LITTLE LEFT OUT LATELY.

182
00:06:30,806 --> 00:06:31,932
narrator: AND THE NEXT MORNING,

183
00:06:31,932 --> 00:06:34,393
THE FAMILY MET AT BUSTER'S 
SEND-OFF PARTY,

184
00:06:34,393 --> 00:06:37,396
WHERE LUCILLE WAS NOT KEEPING 
HER FEELINGS HIDDEN.

185
00:06:37,396 --> 00:06:38,606
- A CAMCORDER.

186
00:06:38,606 --> 00:06:39,940
- THAT'S SO YOU CAN 
VIDEOTAPE IT

187
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:41,817
WHEN THEY PUT YOU 
IN A NAKED PYRAMID

188
00:06:41,817 --> 00:06:44,403
AND POINT TO 
YOUR CHARLIE BROWNS.

189
00:06:44,403 --> 00:06:46,489
- I OUGHT TO POINT TO 
UNCLE OSCAR'S CHARLIE BROWNS

190
00:06:46,489 --> 00:06:48,616
NEXT TIME YOU'RE 
ON TOP OF HIM, MOTHER.

191
00:06:48,616 --> 00:06:51,952
- HE'S MOVING OUT. 
YOU SEE HOW HE TREATS ME?

192
00:06:51,952 --> 00:06:54,413
JUST BECAUSE HE THINKS 
I'M HAVING AN AFFAIR

193
00:06:54,413 --> 00:06:55,414
WITH THE BOY'S UNCLE.

194
00:06:55,414 --> 00:06:57,041
- YES, 
AND SHE'S NOT HAVING AN AFFAIR

195
00:06:57,041 --> 00:07:01,128
WITH THE BOY'S...UNCLE.

196
00:07:01,128 --> 00:07:05,132
- IT'S TOO LATE FOR APOLOGIES. 
I'M GOING TO THE ARMY.

197
00:07:05,132 --> 00:07:07,677
GET ME OUT. 
YOU'VE GOT TO GET ME OUT.

198
00:07:07,677 --> 00:07:08,761
- WELL, YOU KNOW, 
I'M HEADED DOWN TO MEXICO

199
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:09,762
TO TRY TO FIND DAD,

200
00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:11,722
BUT WHEN I GET BACK, MAYBE WE'LL 
TRY TO FIGURE SOMETHING OUT.

201
00:07:11,722 --> 00:07:13,057
narrator: 
AND THAT'S WHEN BUSTER DECIDED

202
00:07:13,057 --> 00:07:15,435
TO SNEAK INTO MEXICO 
TO AVOID THE SERVICE.

203
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:17,186
- NO, NO, I THINK IT'LL 
BE WORKED OUT BY THEN.

204
00:07:17,186 --> 00:07:19,772
[giggles]

205
00:07:19,772 --> 00:07:20,940
- WHAT WAS THAT ALL ABOUT?

206
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,775
- I THINK BUSTER'S GONNA 
ESCAPE TO MEXICO.

207
00:07:22,775 --> 00:07:24,694
DID THE SECRETARY NOT GIVE YOU 
THE PICTURE FOR DAD?

208
00:07:24,694 --> 00:07:26,111
I NEED THAT TO SHOW 
THE PEOPLE DOWN THERE.

209
00:07:26,111 --> 00:07:27,530
- UH, YEAH, 
SHE BROUGHT THAT OVER.

210
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:31,200
- WELL, THIS, 
UH, IS A BLUEPRINT...

211
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,910
OF DAD'S FACE.

212
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:34,411
SHE USED THE BIG PRINTER. 
I'LL GIVE HER THAT.

213
00:07:34,411 --> 00:07:35,955
LET'S GO. 
- NOT SO FAST.

214
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:38,916
GOB, WHO IS THAT MAN 
ON THE COUCH?

215
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:40,084
- OH, THAT GUY?

216
00:07:40,084 --> 00:07:42,044
HE'S MY FRIEND.

217
00:07:42,044 --> 00:07:43,170
- YOU DON'T HAVE ANY FRIENDS.

218
00:07:43,170 --> 00:07:44,464
- I HAVE LOTS OF FRIENDS, 
LINDSAY.

219
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:46,882
narrator: IN FACT, 
THE MAN WAS ICE, A BOUNTY HUNTER

220
00:07:46,882 --> 00:07:48,801
THAT GOB HIRED 
TO FOLLOW MICHAEL.

221
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:52,096
- ICE MAY BE MY BEST FRIEND. 
- GEORGE MICHAEL.

222
00:07:52,096 --> 00:07:53,138
- HE'S MOVING.

223
00:07:53,138 --> 00:07:54,849
- HE'S MOVING.

224
00:07:54,849 --> 00:07:57,184
- FUN PARTY, HUH? 
- NO, NO, IT ISN'T.

225
00:07:57,184 --> 00:07:58,268
LET'S GO DOWN TO MEXICO.

226
00:07:58,268 --> 00:07:59,770
- ALL RIGHT. 
LET ME GRAB ANN REAL QUICK.

227
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:02,147
- WHAT--ANN'S HERE? 
- YEAH, I INVITED HER.

228
00:08:02,147 --> 00:08:04,024
YOU--YOU SAID YOU WANTED 
TO SPEND SOME TIME WITH HER.

229
00:08:04,024 --> 00:08:05,317
YOU SAID I WAS BEING AN ANN HOG.

230
00:08:05,317 --> 00:08:07,152
- ANN HOG'S COMING? 
I MEAN, I THOUGHT IT WAS JUST...

231
00:08:07,152 --> 00:08:08,488
- IT'S JUST ANN. 
- GONNA BE, LIKE, THE TWO OF US.

232
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:10,405
ALL RIGHT, WELL, 
JUST LOAD HER UP IN THE CAR.

233
00:08:10,405 --> 00:08:12,282
- ALL RIGHT.

234
00:08:12,282 --> 00:08:14,660
- LUPE, THAT SWEATER'S 
NOT A TAKE-HOME.

235
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:16,203
MICHAEL, GIVE HER A RIDE HOME.

236
00:08:16,203 --> 00:08:19,582
- I'M GONNA HAVE TO START 
PUTTING PEOPLE IN THE TRUNK.

237
00:08:19,582 --> 00:08:21,291
narrator: 
IN FACT, AT THAT MOMENT,

238
00:08:21,291 --> 00:08:24,294
BUSTER WAS CLIMBING 
INTO THE TRUNK.

239
00:08:27,673 --> 00:08:29,509
- MOTHER, WHEN YOU SEE 
THIS VIDEOTAPE,

240
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:31,218
YOU'LL KNOW THAT I LEFT.

241
00:08:31,218 --> 00:08:33,513
NOT OUT OF COWARDICE, 
BUT OUT OF--

242
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:37,474
[yawns] OH, MAN. 
IT'S TIRING IN HERE.

243
00:08:37,474 --> 00:08:39,476
OH.

244
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:43,773
narrator: 
SIX MINUTES LATER,

245
00:08:43,773 --> 00:08:48,528
MICHAEL DROPPED OFF 
HIS MOTHER'S HOUSEKEEPER.

246
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:50,905
- MEXICO.

247
00:08:50,905 --> 00:08:52,740
narrator: 
IN FACT, HE WAS IN SANTA ANA,

248
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:55,535
A TOWN SIX MINUTES INLAND 
FROM HIS OWN.

249
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:57,703
BUT THE COMBINATION 
OF LOSING HIS GLASSES

250
00:08:57,703 --> 00:08:59,664
AND BREATHING 
CARBON MONOXIDE

251
00:08:59,664 --> 00:09:01,290
HAD IMPAIRED BUSTER'S JUDGMENT.

252
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:05,545
- OH, THIS SHALL KEEP ME SAFE 
FROM THE HOT MEXICAN SUN.

253
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:09,131
- EXCUSE ME. 
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

254
00:09:09,131 --> 00:09:12,718
- [in a Mexican accent] I'M 
TRYING TO FIND A PLACE TO LIVE.

255
00:09:12,718 --> 00:09:14,720
- AY. 
[speaking Spanish]

256
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:25,105
narrator: MICHAEL 
WAS HEADING DOWN TO MEXICO

257
00:09:25,105 --> 00:09:26,732
TO FIND HIS FUGITIVE FATHER.

258
00:09:26,732 --> 00:09:28,275
- CAN YOU BELIEVE THIS?

259
00:09:28,275 --> 00:09:30,152
THIS IS MY TRIP WITH MY SON, 
AND HE'S TOO BUSY

260
00:09:30,152 --> 00:09:32,822
WHISPERING SECRETS TO ANN 
TO SAY ONE WORD TO ME.

261
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:35,575
- WHAT'S THAT? 
- NOTHING.

262
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:38,828
WE'RE NOT 
WHISPERING SECRETS UP HERE.

263
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:40,245
- HEY, CHECK OUT 
WHO'S ON THAT HOG

264
00:09:40,245 --> 00:09:41,246
IN THE REARVIEW MIRROR.

265
00:09:41,246 --> 00:09:44,208
- GEORGE MICHAEL! 
- WHAT?

266
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:48,003
- TWENTY MILES TO LEGOLAND.

267
00:09:49,546 --> 00:09:50,547
[rings]

268
00:09:50,547 --> 00:09:51,591
- THE ICE.

269
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:52,592
WHAT HAVE YOU GOT?

270
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:55,678
- STILL ON HIS TAIL, 
ABOUT 20 MILES FROM LEGOLAND.

271
00:09:55,678 --> 00:09:57,012
- GO GET HIM, FRIEND.

272
00:09:57,012 --> 00:09:59,514
- YOU'RE NOT MY FRIEND. 
YOU'RE A CLIENT.

273
00:09:59,514 --> 00:10:00,515
narrator: GOB REALIZED

274
00:10:00,515 --> 00:10:03,352
THAT PERHAPS HE REALLY DIDN'T 
HAVE ANY FRIENDS.

275
00:10:03,352 --> 00:10:05,437
- AND LUCILLE SENT HERS AWAY.

276
00:10:05,437 --> 00:10:07,898
BUSTER, OSCAR'S LEAVING.

- BUSTER GET IN TRUNK 
OF CAR.

278
00:10:09,859 --> 00:10:12,319
- SO HE'S NOT GOING 
TO THE ARMY.

279
00:10:12,319 --> 00:10:14,488
HE MUST HAVE HAD MICHAEL 
SNEAK HIM INTO MEXICO.

280
00:10:14,488 --> 00:10:16,365
OH, THANK GOD.

281
00:10:16,365 --> 00:10:17,908

both: MMM.

282
00:10:17,908 --> 00:10:18,909
[smooching]

283
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:22,579
- I'LL GO UNPACK.

284
00:10:22,579 --> 00:10:25,040

GO SEE A STAR WAR.

285
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,375
[knocking]

286
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:30,337
WHO IS IT?

287
00:10:30,337 --> 00:10:32,506
- WHAT? 
- I WAS LOOKING FOR BUSTER.

288
00:10:32,506 --> 00:10:35,134
- HE'S NOT HERE. 
- UH, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

289
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:36,761
I MEAN, DO YOU WANT TO GO OUT?

290
00:10:36,761 --> 00:10:39,471
- WHY ARE YOU TRYING 
TO GET ME OUT OF THE HOUSE?

291
00:10:39,471 --> 00:10:42,850
- I JUST THOUGHT 
THAT WE COULD HANG OUT.

292
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:45,645
[door creaking]

293
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:46,896
narrator: 
LUCILLE WAS SUSPICIOUS

294
00:10:46,896 --> 00:10:49,523
THAT GOB WAS UP TO 
SOME SORT OF POWER GRAB.

295
00:10:49,523 --> 00:10:52,109
- GENE PARMESAN? 
LUCILLE BLUTH.

296
00:10:52,109 --> 00:10:54,695
MY SON IS TRYING 
TO GET ME OUT OF MY HOUSE.

297
00:10:54,695 --> 00:10:56,405
I THINK HE MAY BE 
UP TO SOMETHING.

298
00:10:56,405 --> 00:10:57,406
[knocking]

299
00:10:57,406 --> 00:10:59,950
OH, HOLD ON. 
THAT'S PROBABLY HIM.

300
00:11:03,203 --> 00:11:05,706
GENE?

301
00:11:05,706 --> 00:11:08,083
IT'S JUST SOME IDIOT 
WITH BALLOONS.

302
00:11:08,083 --> 00:11:09,293
- OH, IS IT?

303
00:11:09,293 --> 00:11:12,087
- [shrieks] I KNEW IT!

304
00:11:12,087 --> 00:11:16,341

narrator: AND BUSTER WAS 
FINDING HIMSELF RIGHT AT HOME.

306
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:21,096

A SHIRT JUST LIKE THAT.

307
00:11:21,096 --> 00:11:22,597
narrator: 
IT WAS BUSTER'S OLD SHIRT.

308
00:11:22,597 --> 00:11:24,058
LUCILLE HAD GIVEN IT TO LUPE.

309
00:11:24,058 --> 00:11:25,434
- AND THE HAND CHAIR.

310
00:11:25,434 --> 00:11:28,312
I HAD ONE IN MY ROOM. 
I WONDER WHERE THAT WENT.

311
00:11:28,312 --> 00:11:29,479
narrator: IT WENT RIGHT THERE.

312
00:11:29,479 --> 00:11:31,481

I'D MISS A HAND SO MUCH.

313
00:11:31,481 --> 00:11:35,027
YOU PEOPLE ARE JUST LIKE ME.

MEANWHILE, IN THE REAL MEXICO,

315
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:38,739
MICHAEL HAD FOUND 
THE STAIR CAR.

316
00:11:38,739 --> 00:11:40,950

FINDING HIS FATHER.

318
00:11:43,368 --> 00:11:45,037

NO PROBLEM.

319
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:48,791
WHEN DO YOU 
WANT US TO START BUILDING?

320
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:51,043
- THANK YOU. 
GRACIAS.

321
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:52,419
- HEY, DAD, DAD.

322
00:11:52,419 --> 00:11:54,463

THINK OF ANN SO FAR?

323
00:11:54,463 --> 00:11:55,464
- OH, ANN?

324
00:11:55,464 --> 00:11:58,592
I-I JUST-- 
YOU KNOW, I-I BARELY KNOW HER.

325
00:11:58,592 --> 00:12:00,177
YOU KNOW? 
NEITHER OF US DO.

326
00:12:00,177 --> 00:12:02,304
SHE'S JUST REALLY SOME GIRL 
AS FAR AS WE'RE CONCERNED.

327
00:12:02,304 --> 00:12:03,347
RIGHT?

328
00:12:03,347 --> 00:12:05,182
I-I-I'M DETERMINED 
TO GET TO KNOW HER, THOUGH.

329
00:12:05,182 --> 00:12:06,183
- YEAH. 
- OKAY?

330
00:12:06,183 --> 00:12:07,184
- OKAY, I HAVE AN IDEA.

331
00:12:07,184 --> 00:12:08,643
WHEN WE GO BACK,

332
00:12:08,643 --> 00:12:11,105
WHY DON'T JUST THE TWO OF YOU GO 
BACK IN THE STAIR CAR TOGETHER?

333
00:12:11,105 --> 00:12:13,398
- WELL, THAT'S NO FUN.

334
00:12:13,398 --> 00:12:14,524
FOR YOU.

335
00:12:14,524 --> 00:12:16,276
YOU KNOW, YOU GUYS-- 
YOU GUYS SHOULD BE TOGETHER.

336
00:12:16,276 --> 00:12:18,695
- OH-- 
- OR MAYBE JUST YOU AND ME.

337
00:12:18,695 --> 00:12:21,073
IF YOU'D RATHER. 
- YEAH.

338
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:23,909
- OR ME AND ANN-- 
- GREAT, YES, OKAY.

339
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:25,202
I'LL TELL MAEBY 
THAT I'LL BE GOING BACK

340
00:12:25,202 --> 00:12:26,411
WITH HER AND AUNT LINDSAY-- 
GREAT.

341
00:12:26,411 --> 00:12:27,412
- NO, NO, NO, WAIT.

342
00:12:27,412 --> 00:12:28,747
LET'S--LET'S KEEP 
LOOKING FOR POP-POP.

343
00:12:28,747 --> 00:12:29,748
YOU KNOW? 
- OH, OKAY.

344
00:12:29,748 --> 00:12:31,083
- MAYBE SOMEBODY IN THE CHURCH 
WILL KNOW SOMETHING.

345
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:33,961
narrator: IN FACT, 
GEORGE SR. WAS IN THE CHURCH,

346
00:12:33,961 --> 00:12:36,922
WHERE HE WAS MOURNED 
BY HIS LONGTIME ASSISTANT

347
00:12:36,922 --> 00:12:40,050
AND ACCOMPLICE 
TO HIS ESCAPE, KITTY,

348
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:43,720
AS ONLY A FEW DAYS EARLIER, 
HE'D BEEN DECLARED DEAD.

349
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:45,430
[gunshot]

350
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:47,182
BUT BEFORE MICHAEL 
COULD GO INSIDE THE CHURCH--

351
00:12:47,182 --> 00:12:50,102
- [yelling]

352
00:12:50,102 --> 00:12:51,979
- HEY, WAIT A MINUTE. 
WAIT A MINUTE.

353
00:12:51,979 --> 00:12:53,605
I KNOW YOU. 
YOU'RE GOB'S FRIEND.

354
00:12:53,605 --> 00:12:56,608
- NOT FRIEND. 
BOUNTY HUNTER.

355
00:12:56,608 --> 00:12:57,609
- GENE?

356
00:12:57,609 --> 00:12:58,903
THERE'S NO WAY 
YOU'RE THAT GOOD.

357
00:12:58,903 --> 00:13:00,404
- NAME'S ICE.

358
00:13:00,404 --> 00:13:02,489
GOB HIRED ME TO STOP YOU 
FROM FLEEING THE COUNTRY.

359
00:13:02,489 --> 00:13:04,158
- COME--WHAT? 
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

360
00:13:04,158 --> 00:13:07,744
I'M NOT FLEEING THE COUNTRY. 
I'M HERE LOOKING FOR MY FATHER.

361
00:13:07,744 --> 00:13:09,496
BUT YOU'RE OBVIOUSLY 
BETTER AT THIS KIND OF THING,

362
00:13:09,496 --> 00:13:10,497
SO I'LL TELL YOU WHAT.

363
00:13:10,497 --> 00:13:14,293
I'M GONNA CONTINUE PAYING YOU 
TO FIND MY FATHER.

364
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:17,087
YOU CAN ALSO COLLECT 
THE REAL BOUNTY ON HIS HEAD.

365
00:13:17,087 --> 00:13:19,589
- NICE DECK. 
IS THIS WHERE YOU SAW HIM LAST?

366
00:13:19,589 --> 00:13:21,508
- NO, THIS-- 
THAT'S ACTUALLY HIM.

367
00:13:21,508 --> 00:13:23,385
HE'S JUST--HE'S MUCH 
SMALLER IN REAL LIFE.

368
00:13:23,385 --> 00:13:24,845
- I CAN SEE THAT'S A MAN.

369
00:13:24,845 --> 00:13:28,140
I'LL FIND HIM.

370
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:29,599
- LUCKY.

371
00:13:29,599 --> 00:13:31,310
- WHAT DID HE SAY? 
DID HE ASK ABOUT ME?

372
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:33,812
I-I CAN'T BELIEVE HE FOLLOWED US 
ALL THE WAY TO MEXICO.

373
00:13:33,812 --> 00:13:34,939
- UH, THAT'S A BOUNTY HUNTER,

374
00:13:34,939 --> 00:13:38,608
AND, UH, HE'S ON THE CASE, 
SO WE CAN ALL HEAD HOME.

375
00:13:38,608 --> 00:13:41,778
- SO HE'S NOT INTERESTED IN ME?

376
00:13:41,778 --> 00:13:44,364
- NOT UNLESS 
YOU KNOW WHERE DAD IS.

377
00:13:44,364 --> 00:13:46,867
GEORGE MICHAEL.

378
00:13:49,536 --> 00:13:51,496
- OH, HI, DAD. 
YEAH.

379
00:13:51,496 --> 00:13:54,416
THEY THINK YOU'RE IN MEXICO. 
I'LL SEE YOU WHEN I GET HOME.

380
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:56,335
YE--OH, YES. 
THANK YOU.

381
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:58,045
NO, I FOUND 
MY BIRTH CONTROL PILLS.

382
00:13:58,045 --> 00:14:01,131
THANKS FOR ASKING, DAD.

383
00:14:01,131 --> 00:14:02,883
narrator: MAEBY HAD 
HAD ENOUGH OF HER MOTHER

384
00:14:02,883 --> 00:14:04,551
AND DECIDED TO GO BACK 
WITH MICHAEL.

385
00:14:04,551 --> 00:14:07,429
- I'M SO SICK OF HER. 
THE LAME FLIRTING.

386
00:14:07,429 --> 00:14:08,430
narrator: MICHAEL, OF COURSE,

387
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:10,224
THOUGHT MAEBY 
WAS REFERRING TO ANN.

388
00:14:10,224 --> 00:14:12,059
- YOU KNOW, I THINK 
HE'S GONNA GET SICK OF HER

389
00:14:12,059 --> 00:14:13,518
BEFORE IT GOES TOO FAR.

390
00:14:13,518 --> 00:14:15,687
- OF COURSE HE WILL. 
SHE'S A CHILD.

391
00:14:15,687 --> 00:14:17,564
- WELL, THAT--THAT PART'S 
NOT REALLY HER FAULT.

392
00:14:17,564 --> 00:14:20,025
I-I JUST HATE TO SEE HIM 
WASTING HIS TIME, YOU KNOW?

393
00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:21,526
- LET'S JUST GO. 
I'LL BE IN YOUR CAR.

394
00:14:21,526 --> 00:14:23,195
- WELL, IS GEORGE MICHAEL 
OKAY WITH THAT?

395
00:14:23,195 --> 00:14:24,488
- IT'S FINE. 
JUST DRIVE.

396
00:14:24,488 --> 00:14:26,281
narrator: AT NO POINT 
WERE MICHAEL AND MAEBY

397
00:14:26,281 --> 00:14:28,325
TALKING ABOUT THE SAME PERSON.

398
00:14:28,325 --> 00:14:30,702
AND THERE WERE ONLY 
FOUR PEOPLE IN THEIR GROUP.

399
00:14:30,702 --> 00:14:32,621
- AND IT'S NOT A RACE THING.

400
00:14:32,621 --> 00:14:35,332
- YEAH, 
WHOEVER GETS THERE FIRST.

401
00:14:35,332 --> 00:14:38,252
narrator: AND SO MICHAEL 
LEFT WITH HIS NIECE,

402
00:14:38,252 --> 00:14:41,130
FOLLOWED BY HIS SISTER 
AND HIS SON,

403
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:43,173
FOLLOWED BY THE BOUNTY HUNTER.

404
00:14:43,173 --> 00:14:45,217
UNFORTUNATELY, 
THIS LEFT THE GIRL

405
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:49,596
MICHAEL WAS DETERMIND 
TO GET TO KNOW ALONE IN MEXICO.

406
00:14:49,596 --> 00:14:51,723
MEANWHILE, 
BUSTER WAS ADAPTING TO LIFE

407
00:14:51,723 --> 00:14:54,184
IN WHAT HE THOUGHT 
WAS MEXICO, BUT WAS IN FACT

408
00:14:54,184 --> 00:14:56,896
A TOWN SO CLOSE TO HOME 
THAT THEY SHARED A PAPERBOY.

409
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:59,856
- I KNOW THAT GUY. 
HEY, WHERE'S YOUR MOTHER?

410
00:14:59,856 --> 00:15:02,734
- OH, I LOVE THIS WAY OF LIFE. 
THIS IS WHERE I BELONG.

411
00:15:02,734 --> 00:15:05,362
I LOVE BEING MEXICAN.

412
00:15:05,362 --> 00:15:06,947
- WE MUST WORK NOW, AMIGO. 
ADIOS.

413
00:15:06,947 --> 00:15:08,823
- OH, NO, NO. 
I'M GOING WITH YOU.

414
00:15:08,823 --> 00:15:11,785
[in a Mexican accent] 
I AM ONE OF YOU NOW, SI?

415
00:15:11,785 --> 00:15:13,703
narrator: AND MICHAEL, 
ON HIS WAY BACK HOME,

416
00:15:13,703 --> 00:15:14,914
BONDED WITH MAEBY.

417
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:17,917
- I MEAN, WHY DOES EVERYONE 
HAVE TO DATE ANYWAYS?

418
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:20,502
- RIGHT, I MEAN, 
ISN'T FAMILY ENOUGH FOR PEOPLE?

419
00:15:20,502 --> 00:15:22,629
AND, YOU KNOW, 
NOT TO FEEL SORRY FOR MYSELF,

420
00:15:22,629 --> 00:15:24,673
BUT IT'S LIKE 
I'M BEING FORGOTTEN HERE.

421
00:15:27,884 --> 00:15:30,012
narrator: AND SOON 
THEY ALL ARRIVED AT HOME.

422
00:15:30,012 --> 00:15:32,722
- HEY, YOU'RE HERE ALREADY. 
- YEAH, WE WON.

423
00:15:32,722 --> 00:15:34,849
- SO, UH, YOU GUYS HAVE 
A GOOD TALK?

424
00:15:34,849 --> 00:15:35,850
- YEAH. 
GREAT TALK.

425
00:15:35,850 --> 00:15:37,519
THAT COUSIN OF YOURS 
IS A HELL OF A GIRL.

426
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:38,603
IT'S TOO BAD YOU CAN'T DATE HER.

427
00:15:38,603 --> 00:15:40,105
- NO. 
I MEANT--

428
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:43,608
WAIT, YOU WOULDN'T 
HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THAT?

429
00:15:43,608 --> 00:15:44,985
NOTHING.

430
00:15:44,985 --> 00:15:46,611
NO, I WAS 
TALKING ABOUT ANN.

431
00:15:46,611 --> 00:15:50,324
WHAT DID YOU THINK OF HER?

432
00:16:01,335 --> 00:16:02,627
narrator: 
MICHAEL HAD JUST DISCOVERED

433
00:16:02,627 --> 00:16:04,964
HE'D LEFT 
HIS SON'S GIRLFRIEND IN MEXICO.

434
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:09,969
- SHE'S GONNA BE FINE. 
WE JUST GOT TO BEAT THE SUN.

435
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:12,846
- HEY, YOU THINK I'M HAPPY 
ABOUT THIS?

436
00:16:12,846 --> 00:16:14,098
BUT, HEY, WE ARE GETTING 
THAT TRIP TOGETHER

437
00:16:14,098 --> 00:16:15,182
WE WANTED, THOUGH, HUH?

438
00:16:15,182 --> 00:16:17,684
AND LOOK. 
TWO EXITS TO LEGOLAND.

439
00:16:17,684 --> 00:16:19,478
- I JUST WANT TO FIND ANN.

440
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:22,606
- THAT'S MY WHOLE THING TOO.

441
00:16:22,606 --> 00:16:24,649
narrator: AND GOB WAS 
STILL SEARCHING FOR A FRIEND.

442
00:16:24,649 --> 00:16:26,401
- SHOW TONIGHT?

443
00:16:26,401 --> 00:16:29,738
- WELL, I WON'T KNOW OFFICIALLY 
UNTIL 8:01,

444
00:16:29,738 --> 00:16:33,200
BUT I FIGURED 
IF I BLUE MYSELF EARLY,

445
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:36,453
I'D BE NICE AND RELAXED 
FOR A 9:00 DINNER RESERVATION.

446
00:16:36,453 --> 00:16:37,621
[chuckles]

447
00:16:37,621 --> 00:16:40,332
AND IF YOU'D LIKE, I CAN MAKE 
THAT RESERVATION FOR--

448
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:41,958
- LOOKING FOR SOME COMPANY OR--

449
00:16:41,958 --> 00:16:45,212
- I SURE AM.

450
00:16:45,212 --> 00:16:47,964
WHAT ARE YOU DOING? 
YOU'RE GONNA SCARE AWAY THE ICE.

451
00:16:47,964 --> 00:16:50,259
- ICE? 
ICE IS OUT THERE?

452
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:51,260
WHERE'S MICHAEL?

453
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:54,221
- HE WENT BACK TO MEXICO.

454
00:16:54,221 --> 00:16:56,431
- HMM, I KNEW 
HE WAS TRYING TO FLEE.

455
00:16:56,431 --> 00:16:58,183
- WHERE THE HELL DID HE GO?

456
00:16:58,183 --> 00:17:00,019
- [yells] 
- WHOA!

457
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:01,436
- ICE, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

458
00:17:01,436 --> 00:17:03,355
- GEORGE BLUTH, 
YOU'RE COMING WITH ME.

459
00:17:03,355 --> 00:17:04,731
- THAT'S NOT MY FATHER.

460
00:17:04,731 --> 00:17:07,151
- WELL, ACCORDING TO 
MY PHOTOGRAPH, IT IS.

461
00:17:07,151 --> 00:17:09,819
- [laughs] 
IT'S AN HONEST MISTAKE.

462
00:17:09,819 --> 00:17:12,489
ALSO, I THINK YOUR KNEE 
IS ON MY HEART.

463
00:17:12,489 --> 00:17:13,573
- HE'S MY HUSBAND.

464
00:17:13,573 --> 00:17:15,575
MY FATHER IS PROBABLY 
STILL IN MEXICO.

465
00:17:15,575 --> 00:17:17,327
I WAS JUST HOPING 
TO HAVE SEX WITH YOU.

466
00:17:17,327 --> 00:17:19,163
- WHY AM I NOT BLACKING OUT?

467
00:17:19,163 --> 00:17:22,166
- HE SET ME UP. 
MICHAEL SET ME UP.

468
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:25,710
- HEY, WHO WANTS TO GO 
TO THE HOSPITAL?

469
00:17:25,710 --> 00:17:28,047
narrator: AND BUSTER WENT 
TO HIS JOB AS A DISHWASHER.

470
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:30,090
- THIS IS GREAT. 
WE'RE LIKE SLAVE BUDDIES.

471
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:31,341
[chuckles]

472
00:17:31,341 --> 00:17:33,385
OH.

473
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:35,554
narrator: SOON, 
THE GUYS ARRIVED IN MEXICO

474
00:17:35,554 --> 00:17:37,472
AND SPLIT UP TO FIND ANN.

475
00:17:37,472 --> 00:17:38,848
- ANN? 
ANN?

476
00:17:38,848 --> 00:17:40,517
OH, THANK GOD, 
YOU'RE ALL RIGHT.

477
00:17:40,517 --> 00:17:41,893
- MR. BLUTH?

478
00:17:41,893 --> 00:17:44,313
ANN, OH, THANK GOD, 
YOU'RE ALL RIGHT.

479
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:46,815
UH, YOU ARE ANN, RIGHT?

480
00:17:46,815 --> 00:17:48,067
YES, OF COURSE YOU ARE.

481
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:50,527
- ANN, OH, MY-- 
- IT IS--WE GOT HER.

482
00:17:50,527 --> 00:17:52,071
OKAY, LET'S GO AHEAD AND LOAD UP 
IN THE TRUCK.

483
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:54,823
I THINK WE'RE 
CRASHING SOME POOR GUY'S WAKE.

484
00:17:56,991 --> 00:17:58,160
- MICHAEL, MICHAEL, MICHAEL!

485
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,578
- GOB? 
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

486
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:00,995
- FLEEING THE COUNTRY? 
YOU BASTARD.

487
00:18:00,995 --> 00:18:04,166
- NO. 
I'M STILL NOT FLEEING, OKAY?

488
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:06,376
I'M JUST HERE TO PICK UP 
MY SON'S GIRLFRIEND.

489
00:18:06,376 --> 00:18:08,002
SHE RAN OFF THE LAST TIME 
WE WERE LEAVING.

490
00:18:08,002 --> 00:18:10,755
- ACTUALLY, I WAS SITTING 
RIGHT THERE THE WHOLE TIME.

491
00:18:10,755 --> 00:18:11,923
- YEAH? 
WAY TO PLANT, ANN.

492
00:18:11,923 --> 00:18:13,508
- GEORGE MICHAEL, UH, LISTEN.

493
00:18:13,508 --> 00:18:15,051
WHY DON'T YOU AND PLANT 
JUST WAIT IN THE STAIR CAR.

494
00:18:15,051 --> 00:18:16,095
I'M GONNA 
FINISH UP HERE WITH GOB.

495
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:17,179
- WHAT A SCARE.

496
00:18:17,179 --> 00:18:18,347
- WHAT IS THAT? 
THAT'S HIS GIRLFRIEND?

497
00:18:18,347 --> 00:18:19,514
- YEAH.

498
00:18:19,514 --> 00:18:20,682
- WHAT, IS SHE FUNNY 
OR SOMETHING?

499
00:18:20,682 --> 00:18:22,016
- DON'T--DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

500
00:18:22,016 --> 00:18:23,810
WHY DO YOU KEEP THINKING 
THAT I'M RUNNING AWAY?

501
00:18:23,810 --> 00:18:25,061
- I MEAN, 
IT IS KIND OF SUSPICIOUS

502
00:18:25,061 --> 00:18:27,147
YOU DIDN'T EVEN ASK ME 
TO DRIVE DOWN HERE WITH YOU.

503
00:18:27,147 --> 00:18:29,316
- WELL, THE ONLY REASON 
I DIDN'T ASK YOU TO COME WITH US

504
00:18:29,316 --> 00:18:31,151
IS BECAUSE OF 
YOUR CHICKEN IMPRESSION.

505
00:18:31,151 --> 00:18:32,986
- YEAH, WE SURE DID GET IN A LOT 
OF TROUBLE FOR THAT LAST TIME.

506
00:18:32,986 --> 00:18:33,987
DIDN'T WE? 
- OH, YEAH.

507
00:18:33,987 --> 00:18:35,322
- I WAS ALL-- 
[clucking]

508
00:18:35,322 --> 00:18:36,906
- HEY, NO. 
YOU'RE DOING IT AGAIN.

509
00:18:36,906 --> 00:18:38,617
- [yelling]

510
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:39,743
- GET OFF HIM. 
HE DOESN'T KNOW WHAT HE'S DOING.

511
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:40,744
HE'S AMERICAN.

512
00:18:40,744 --> 00:18:43,872
- AMERICANO, EH? 
JUST LIKE ME.

513
00:18:43,872 --> 00:18:45,915
GENE PARMESAN. 
HOW YOU DOING?

514
00:18:45,915 --> 00:18:47,709
- GENE! 
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING?

515
00:18:47,709 --> 00:18:49,085
- WELL, YOUR MOTHER SENT ME 
TO FIND YOU.

516
00:18:49,085 --> 00:18:51,630
SHE WAS WORRIED YOU WERE 
UP TO SOMETHING.

517
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:53,590
- I WAS JUST LOOKING 
FOR A FRIEND.

518
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:55,467
- WHAT? 
- YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT, MICHAEL.

519
00:18:55,467 --> 00:18:58,762
I WENT TO OUR MOTHER BECAUSE 
I DON'T HAVE ANY FRIENDS.

520
00:18:58,762 --> 00:19:01,097
- OH, THAT'S FUNNY. 
- THANK YOU.

521
00:19:01,097 --> 00:19:02,891
GENE, CAN I JUST HAVE 
A PRIVATE MOMENT, PLEASE?

522
00:19:02,891 --> 00:19:03,933
- OKAY. 
YOU'RE ON THE CLOCK.

523
00:19:03,933 --> 00:19:05,144
- THANK YOU.

524
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:06,145
GOB, WHAT ARE YOU 
TALKING ABOUT?

525
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:08,021
IF ANYBODY NEEDS A FRIEND 
RIGHT NOW, IT'S ME.

526
00:19:08,021 --> 00:19:09,731
I MEAN, YOU KNOW, 
MY SON'S FURIOUS AT ME,

527
00:19:09,731 --> 00:19:12,066
AND HE SPENDS ALL OF HIS 
FREE TIME WITH THIS GIRL

528
00:19:12,066 --> 00:19:13,777
THAT, FRANKLY, 
I'M NOT THAT CRAZY ABOUT.

529
00:19:13,777 --> 00:19:15,154
- NOT CRAZY ABOUT?

530
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:18,157
OR NOT CRAZY ABOUT 
YOUR SON GROWING UP?

531
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:21,535
- UH--MAYBE--MAYBE 
YOU'RE RIGHT ABOUT THAT.

532
00:19:21,535 --> 00:19:24,538
AND I REALLY HAVEN'T 
GOTTEN TO KNOW HER.

533
00:19:24,538 --> 00:19:26,331
I'VE BEEN 
A LITTLE SELFISH, SO--

534
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:28,542
SEE? 
YOU ARE A FRIEND.

535
00:19:28,542 --> 00:19:30,627
YOU KNOW, I'M--I'M ALWAYS 
GONNA LOOK OUT FOR YOU.

536
00:19:30,627 --> 00:19:31,628
ALL RIGHT?

537
00:19:31,628 --> 00:19:34,964
AND YOU'RE ALWAYS GONNA 
LOOK OUT FOR ME.

538
00:19:34,964 --> 00:19:38,302
- [yells]

539
00:19:38,302 --> 00:19:40,094
- SORRY. 
I DID SEE HIM COMING.

540
00:19:40,094 --> 00:19:42,264
IT'S JUST, 
I KIND OF WANTED TO SEE

541
00:19:42,264 --> 00:19:44,098
WHERE YOU WERE GOING 
WITH THAT.

542
00:19:47,852 --> 00:19:49,479
- WHERE'S UNCLE GOB?

543
00:19:49,479 --> 00:19:52,607
- WELL, I GAVE 
THE BOUNTY HUNTER AND THE P.I.

544
00:19:52,607 --> 00:19:53,775
A FEW EXTRA BUCKS

545
00:19:53,775 --> 00:19:55,277
TO BE HIS FRIENDS 
FOR THE WEEKEND--

546
00:19:55,277 --> 00:19:57,237
WHILE THE THREE OF THEM 
ARE LOOKING FOR MY FATHER.

547
00:19:57,237 --> 00:19:59,698
AND I WANT TO GET TO KNOW 
A NEW FRIEND TOO.

548
00:19:59,698 --> 00:20:03,410
ANN, WHY DON'T YOU TELL ME 
A LITTLE BIT ABOUT YOURSELF?

549
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:07,789
[engine turns over]

550
00:20:07,789 --> 00:20:10,625
narrator: 
THE NEXT DAY, BUSTER WAS HAPPY.

551
00:20:10,625 --> 00:20:13,212
AND HE DECIDED TO NEVER 
GO HOME AGAIN.

552
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:14,338
- [humming]

553
00:20:14,338 --> 00:20:15,380
DELIVERY FROM THE KITCHEN.

554
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:17,549
narrator: BUT UNFORTUNATELY, 
HE WAS ALREADY THERE.

555
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:18,883
- [gasps] MOTHER!

556
00:20:18,883 --> 00:20:19,884
- BUSTER!

557
00:20:19,884 --> 00:20:21,595
I THOUGHT YOU WERE IN MEXICO.

558
00:20:21,595 --> 00:20:23,096
- SO DID I!

559
00:20:23,096 --> 00:20:24,097
- OH!

560
00:20:24,097 --> 00:20:26,099
- narrator: AND THE NEXT DAY, 
MICHAEL RETURNED TO WORK,

561
00:20:26,099 --> 00:20:28,101
KNOWING A LITTLE MORE 
ABOUT HIS SON'S GIRLFRIEND.

562
00:20:28,101 --> 00:20:29,603
- YOU TELL ANN 
TO MAKE SURE SHE STUDIES

563
00:20:29,603 --> 00:20:31,563
FOR MR. MASON'S 
ALGEBRA II TEST TOMORROW,

564
00:20:31,563 --> 00:20:32,564
AND TELL HER TO MAKE SURE

565
00:20:32,564 --> 00:20:37,236
THAT KIM CHO DOESN'T 
CHEAT OFF HER THIS TIME.

566
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:39,195
- WOW. 
YOU REALLY GOT TO KNOW HER.

567
00:20:39,195 --> 00:20:41,781
- WELL, WE DID SPEND THREE HOURS 
TOGETHER IN THAT CAR RIDE.

568
00:20:41,781 --> 00:20:45,244
- SO, WHAT'D YOU THINK? 
- I DON'T LIKE HER.

569
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:47,662
narrator: ON THE NEXT 
"ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT."

570
00:20:47,662 --> 00:20:52,251
BUSTER RECLAIMS 
HIS FAVORITE CHAIR.

571
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:53,252
- [gasps]

572
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:54,753
- BUT THE VICTORY 
IS SHORT-LIVED.

573
00:20:54,753 --> 00:20:58,382
- MAKE LOVE 
IN YOUR OWN HAND, MOTHER!

574
00:20:58,382 --> 00:21:00,216
narrator: AND TOBIAS GETS 
MEDICAL ATTENTION.

575
00:21:00,216 --> 00:21:01,260
- OH, THANK GOD! 
A NEW DOCTOR.

576
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:03,262
FINALLY WE CAN GET 
A STRAIGHT ANSWER IN THIS PLACE.

577
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:06,265
- UH, I'VE GOT SOME BAD NEWS.

578
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:08,267
I'M GENE PARMESAN. 
HOW YOU DOIN'?

579
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:11,645
- [shrieks] HE GOT ME AGAIN! 
[laughs]

580
00:21:11,645 --> 00:21:15,774
- BUT I DID OVERHEAR 
THAT HE'S BLEEDING INTERNALLY.
