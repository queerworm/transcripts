00:00:15,348 --> 00:00:19,310
[narrator] <i>On the day of Lucille's trial</i>
<i>for her various crimes at sea,</i>

2
00:00:19,394 --> 00:00:23,064
<i>and in the crab restaurant that served</i>
<i>as the maritime court room...</i>

3
00:00:23,148 --> 00:00:26,276
The defense calls to the oyster bar thing
where they sit:

4
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:29,279
the adopted daughter, Lindsay Bluth.

5
00:00:29,362 --> 00:00:31,489
<i>Lucille was questioning the wisdom</i>

6
00:00:31,573 --> 00:00:34,826
<i>of threatening to withhold payment</i>
<i>for her daughter's testimony.</i>

7
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:36,286
Have you seen Lindsay Bluth?

8
00:00:36,369 --> 00:00:40,290
<i>It was a threat that affected</i>
<i>Lindsay's husband Tobias as well,</i>

9
00:00:40,832 --> 00:00:43,501
{\an8}<i>as they had just purchased</i>
<i>a family home...</i>

10
00:00:43,585 --> 00:00:45,879
{\an8}What's this? Mother's not going to pay?

11
00:00:45,962 --> 00:00:47,172
<i>...they could neither afford...</i>

12
00:00:47,255 --> 00:00:50,508
She said she'd only pay me
if my testimony is believable, but--

13
00:00:50,592 --> 00:00:51,426
Lindsay!

14
00:00:51,509 --> 00:00:52,886
<i>...nor find each other in.</i>

15
00:00:52,969 --> 00:00:56,306
How am I supposed to say something
like, "I love you, Mother,"

16
00:00:56,389 --> 00:00:57,640
and sound believable?

17
00:00:58,058 --> 00:00:58,933
Oh, Jesus...

18
00:00:59,267 --> 00:01:00,518
Jesus C. Penney!

19
00:01:00,602 --> 00:01:04,064
You know, I wish I had the luxury
of not sounding believable,

20
00:01:04,147 --> 00:01:06,649
but that's not an option
for an out-of-work actor, is it?

21
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:08,943
Or it's why you're out of work!

22
00:01:09,027 --> 00:01:13,823
Well, I beg one's pardon, but I have been
dying to go to that method acting clinic

23
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:16,868
that I see on my nightly drives,
but you won't let me.

24
00:01:16,951 --> 00:01:21,706
Because you already wasted all that money
on Carl Weathers' Master Acting Class.

25
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:25,001
Well, I'm sorry,
but I'm such a starving [bleep]

26
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:27,962
...that I didn't pay attention
to anything he said.

27
00:01:28,046 --> 00:01:30,840
Oh, well then, maybe I should go
to your method acting class

28
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:32,967
to make my testimony more believable.

29
00:01:33,051 --> 00:01:35,303
That's actually a good idea.
Maybe you could-- Oh.

30
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:36,805
Yes.

31
00:01:37,263 --> 00:01:39,307
Well, perhaps we should go together.

32
00:01:40,558 --> 00:01:42,727
Yeah, it might be good for us as a couple.

33
00:01:43,269 --> 00:01:44,437
I do hope so.

34
00:01:45,021 --> 00:01:46,856
I really want to make this work.

35
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:47,899
Me, too.

36
00:01:48,608 --> 00:01:50,485
I really love you, Tobias.

37
00:01:51,069 --> 00:01:54,656
Oh, Lindsay, we have got to get you
to that acting clinic.

38
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:57,158
That was with me picturing fudge.

39
00:01:58,952 --> 00:01:59,786
Fudge.

40
00:02:00,745 --> 00:02:02,664
{\an8}<i>Now the story of what happened</i>

41
00:02:02,747 --> 00:02:06,960
{\an8}<i>when the one man</i>
<i>who was holding his family together</i>

42
00:02:07,043 --> 00:02:08,086
<i>finally let go</i>

43
00:02:08,169 --> 00:02:11,798
{\an8}<i>and the separate journeys</i>
<i>that eventually gave them no choice</i>

44
00:02:11,881 --> 00:02:13,216
<i>but to come back together.</i>

45
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:17,178
{\an8}<i>It's </i>Arrested Development:
Fateful Consequences.

46
00:02:19,597 --> 00:02:22,976
{\an8}<i>To bond with her husband</i>
<i>and prepare for her testimony,</i>

47
00:02:23,059 --> 00:02:26,521
{\an8}<i>Lindsay had decided to attend</i>
<i>an acting class with Tobias.</i>

48
00:02:26,604 --> 00:02:29,315
{\an8}This is the first time
I've done something like this with you.

49
00:02:29,399 --> 00:02:31,359
{\an8}I think I always looked down on it.

50
00:02:31,943 --> 00:02:35,697
{\an8}Lindsay, I think you'll find that some
of what used to seem clueless about me

51
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:37,782
{\an8}is actually something I'm quite good at.

52
00:02:38,616 --> 00:02:40,660
{\an8}This... is where I belong.

53
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:43,454
{\an8}If you're new here,
you need to go to the window.

54
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:45,081
{\an8}Fill out this form first.

55
00:02:45,415 --> 00:02:48,251
There's some personal questions on it
like how you first got hooked.

56
00:02:48,334 --> 00:02:50,795
{\an8}That's an easy one.
<i>You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown.</i>

57
00:02:52,422 --> 00:02:53,590
No, <i>Mame.</i>

58
00:02:54,424 --> 00:02:57,760
{\an8}No, ma'am? <i>You're a Good Ma'am...</i>
<i>You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown.</i>

59
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:00,054
{\an8}<i>-Gypsy.</i>
-You come up here

60
00:03:00,138 --> 00:03:01,556
and be as truthful as possible.

61
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:05,768
{\an8}They're starting the monologues.
I think this is from<i> Songs for my Father.</i>

62
00:03:06,895 --> 00:03:09,189
What did you say the name
of this acting class was again?

63
00:03:09,272 --> 00:03:10,398
Method One Clinic.

64
00:03:10,481 --> 00:03:12,233
{\an8}Okay, I'm gonna go get a coffee.

65
00:03:13,067 --> 00:03:14,986
Garden Grove Method One Clinic.

66
00:03:15,069 --> 00:03:17,363
{\an8}<i>And that's when Tobias became entranced</i>

67
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:20,867
{\an8}<i>by what he first thought was</i>
<i>a Carol Channing impersonator...</i>

68
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:23,286
{\an8}I made it in that movie,
<i>The Fantastic Four.</i>

69
00:03:23,536 --> 00:03:26,998
{\an8}<i>...but soon recognized to be an actress</i>
<i>with a brief movie career.</i>

70
00:03:27,081 --> 00:03:28,458
{\an8}It was fantastic for me.

71
00:03:29,167 --> 00:03:33,046
I got carried away and I'm like,
"This [bleep] is [bleep] up.

72
00:03:33,129 --> 00:03:36,758
{\an8}And I'm gonna get my [bleep] together
or I'm gonna be [bleep] up, too."

73
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:39,761
{\an8}Anyways, now I'm sober and I'm trying...

74
00:03:41,095 --> 00:03:41,971
...super-hard.

75
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:44,057
[group applauds]

76
00:03:44,849 --> 00:03:47,727
<i>It was a devastating and personal story.</i>

77
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:48,686
Okay, notes.

78
00:03:49,145 --> 00:03:51,856
First of all,
it seemed you were slurring a bit there.

79
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:56,277
I just think you'd have so much more fun
punching those words. Get it out there.

80
00:03:56,361 --> 00:03:59,072
"This [bleep] is [bleep] up, sir!"

81
00:03:59,155 --> 00:04:01,449
I'm sorry.
I'm not familiar with the piece, so...

82
00:04:01,532 --> 00:04:02,825
No, that's it.

83
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:07,205
But I am familiar with your work
in <i>The Fantastic Four, </i>however.

84
00:04:07,288 --> 00:04:08,873
-You've seen that?
-Of course.

85
00:04:08,957 --> 00:04:12,335
<i>Twenty years earlier,</i>
<i>DeBrie Bardeaux had played Sue Storm</i>

86
00:04:12,418 --> 00:04:15,088
<i>in the low-budget version</i>
<i>of The Fantastic Four,</i>

87
00:04:15,171 --> 00:04:16,965
<i>produced by Imagine Entertainment.</i>

88
00:04:17,048 --> 00:04:20,468
I almost never get recognized
as the Invisible Girl.

89
00:04:20,551 --> 00:04:22,011
{\an8}I can't believe you saw me.

90
00:04:22,303 --> 00:04:25,473
{\an8}Well, I thought it was "fantastic...

91
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:30,561
{\an8}...for" a threadbare production
of<i> Fantastic Four.</i>

92
00:04:30,645 --> 00:04:34,440
<i>Actually, most of the performance</i>
<i>that had so captivated Tobias</i>

93
00:04:34,524 --> 00:04:36,734
<i>was performed by a bare thread.</i>

94
00:04:36,818 --> 00:04:38,778
<i>This is the gayest Starbucks ever!</i>

95
00:04:41,823 --> 00:04:44,117
<i>Did his fishing line break, too?</i>

96
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:46,369
Well, my acting career is over.

97
00:04:46,744 --> 00:04:49,414
Don't say that. You've got to say,
"Keep the dream alive!"

98
00:04:49,497 --> 00:04:50,581
That's what helps me.

99
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:52,458
This is what's helping me.

100
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:54,794
It's really good.

101
00:04:54,877 --> 00:04:56,754
Here is to our acting addiction.

102
00:04:56,838 --> 00:04:58,798
-Yep.
-May we never be cured.

103
00:05:00,341 --> 00:05:01,342
Are you crying?

104
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:04,304
I'm crying. Oh, it's a nosebleed.

105
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:08,391
Thank you so much.

106
00:05:09,058 --> 00:05:10,810
<i>Tobias had found a friend.</i>

107
00:05:10,893 --> 00:05:12,854
-You're neat!
-You're neat.

108
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:15,273
-You're neat.
-You're neat.

109
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:20,737
<i>Lindsay had just discovered</i>

110
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:23,656
<i>that the Garden Grove Method One Clinic</i>
<i>for Acting</i>

111
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:27,660
<i>was actually the Garden Grove</i>
<i>Methadone Clinic for Methadone.</i>

112
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:30,496
<i>And she was reflecting on the shaman...</i>

113
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:32,874
You are living a life without love

114
00:05:32,957 --> 00:05:34,876
because you only care about appearances.

115
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:37,337
<i>...who had inspired her return</i>
<i>to her husband.</i>

116
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:39,630
Love is where you left it.

117
00:05:39,714 --> 00:05:41,591
The only person back home is Tobias.

118
00:05:41,674 --> 00:05:44,886
<i>And was wondering if there was any wisdom</i>
<i>in this at all...</i>

119
00:05:44,969 --> 00:05:47,555
It's not free trade
and if it's not free trade, it's [bleep].

120
00:05:47,638 --> 00:05:48,806
<i>...when she noticed a man.</i>

121
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:50,058
You don't look like a junkie.

122
00:05:50,516 --> 00:05:52,226
You do. What do you weigh?
Like 90 pounds?

123
00:05:53,102 --> 00:05:54,479
That's so funny.

124
00:05:54,896 --> 00:05:57,190
God, thank you, but no.

125
00:05:57,648 --> 00:05:59,484
If I'm addicted to anything, it's alcohol.

126
00:06:00,276 --> 00:06:01,903
I'm Lindsay. And you're...

127
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:03,863
Biteme.

128
00:06:04,113 --> 00:06:06,366
I don't like giving my name
to any state organizations,

129
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:08,409
especially after I got kicked off
the voter rolls.

130
00:06:08,493 --> 00:06:10,620
I accidentally signed up
for the wrong political group.

131
00:06:10,953 --> 00:06:12,121
What group was that?

132
00:06:12,455 --> 00:06:13,581
I don't even remember.

133
00:06:13,956 --> 00:06:15,666
Just some guy in a booth on the boardwalk.

134
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:17,293
<i>He joined al-Qaeda.</i>

135
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:19,962
I only signed up because
he was giving away a free beard brush.

136
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:22,298
<i>That says "al-Qaeda" on it.</i>

137
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:24,926
<i>But maybe he thought it was</i>
<i>the designer of the brush.</i>

138
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:26,052
I'm Marky Bark.

139
00:06:26,344 --> 00:06:28,179
Of the tree-freer Barks?

140
00:06:28,262 --> 00:06:30,723
<i>Marky was the son of Johnny Bark,</i>

141
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:33,643
<i>an activist</i>
<i>that Lindsay had once helped save</i>

142
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:35,019
<i>and then kill a tree.</i>

143
00:06:35,103 --> 00:06:38,439
I remember thinking one day
he was just gonna fall out of a tree

144
00:06:38,523 --> 00:06:39,399
and break his neck.

145
00:06:39,732 --> 00:06:40,775
Whatever happened to him?

146
00:06:40,858 --> 00:06:42,443
He fell out of a tree and broke his neck.

147
00:06:43,111 --> 00:06:44,445
So are you here alone?

148
00:06:44,529 --> 00:06:45,613
No, I'm with her.

149
00:06:46,447 --> 00:06:49,450
Listen, the only time DeBrie can keep
food down is for about 20 minutes

150
00:06:49,534 --> 00:06:51,369
after she comes crashing off
the methadone.

151
00:06:52,161 --> 00:06:55,790
Would you care to join us as we rustle up
some grub to shove down our mouths?

152
00:06:56,582 --> 00:06:58,000
I would like that very much.

153
00:06:58,209 --> 00:07:00,044
It just so happens we're free today.

154
00:07:00,128 --> 00:07:02,797
I'm not due in court
until, like, eight bells.

155
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,757
<i>The two couples headed off for lunch</i>

156
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:07,885
<i>despite the fact</i>
<i>that the maritime clock has eight bells</i>

157
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:09,679
<i>at twelve o'clock in the forenoon</i>

158
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:11,764
<i>which was when Lucille discovered</i>

159
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:15,476
<i>that Lindsay wasn't the only Bluth</i>
<i>who didn't show up for her trial.</i>

160
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:18,020
<i>Gob's excuse was equally compelling.</i>

161
00:07:18,354 --> 00:07:21,607
<i>Gob had been involved</i>
<i>in an escape act gone wrong</i>

162
00:07:21,691 --> 00:07:24,110
<i>and wound up in a storage unit in Tustin.</i>

163
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:28,114
<i>And on the day of the trial,</i>
<i>he awoke in a hospital,</i>

164
00:07:28,197 --> 00:07:30,491
<i>happy to finally see a familiar shape.</i>

165
00:07:30,575 --> 00:07:31,576
You humiliated me.

166
00:07:32,243 --> 00:07:34,704
You made a mockery of my religion
and you ruined our wedding.

167
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:36,539
Our first fight.

168
00:07:36,831 --> 00:07:40,293
And like all fights, you're
a little right, I'm a little right.

169
00:07:40,376 --> 00:07:42,086
I sold your cave on Craigslist.

170
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:43,337
So it was all worth it.

171
00:07:43,421 --> 00:07:46,340
<i>She unknowingly sold the cave</i>
<i>to another Bluth</i>

172
00:07:46,424 --> 00:07:47,675
<i>who missed the trial...</i>

173
00:07:47,758 --> 00:07:51,137
Okay, look up "large mud huts,
can fit 20..."

174
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:55,057
<i>...while purchasing a larger sweat lodge</i>
<i>for the desert sweat 'n' squeeze</i>

175
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:56,851
<i>he was in the process of building.</i>

176
00:07:57,018 --> 00:07:57,852
Ship it.

177
00:07:57,935 --> 00:07:59,896
<i>But it was Lucille's son Buster</i>

178
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:03,691
<i>upon whom Lucille most relied</i>
<i>as her star witness,</i>

179
00:08:03,774 --> 00:08:07,278
<i>as it was his testimony</i>
<i>that was to save Lucille's skin</i>

180
00:08:07,361 --> 00:08:09,739
<i>from charges of stealing the Queen Mary.</i>

181
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:12,533
Homosexuals kidnapped the boat
and took it on a joyride,

182
00:08:12,617 --> 00:08:14,702
then she realized
that her son fell off the boat

183
00:08:14,785 --> 00:08:16,245
and into the water and she went back.

184
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:18,498
And a fish swam by my ankle.

185
00:08:19,207 --> 00:08:22,335
-That really happened.
-And he'll be wearing his army uniform,

186
00:08:22,418 --> 00:08:24,545
so I can pretend I'm proud of him again.

187
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:26,506
I can't find my army uniform.

188
00:08:28,049 --> 00:08:30,760
I thought the jury might like it
if I show up as John John Kennedy.

189
00:08:30,843 --> 00:08:33,137
Oh, yeah, that went over great last time.

190
00:08:35,097 --> 00:08:38,309
And it was offensive. Half your testicle
was hanging out of that thing.

191
00:08:38,601 --> 00:08:39,435
Good!

192
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:41,729
I'm glad they saw it.

193
00:08:42,688 --> 00:08:44,941
It was like a Motherboy ball, right?

194
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:46,859
Put on your new uniform

195
00:08:47,151 --> 00:08:51,072
with long pants and keep your ball joke
to yourself, Andrew Dice Clay.

196
00:08:51,489 --> 00:08:53,199
<i>But tensions had mounted.</i>

197
00:08:53,282 --> 00:08:56,953
So you could see why I need the testimony
of someone who's not a hot mess.

198
00:08:57,036 --> 00:08:58,913
-You're a hot mess!
-You're a hot mess!

199
00:08:58,996 --> 00:09:01,082
<i>And another mother-son spat...</i>

200
00:09:01,165 --> 00:09:02,291
I'm going to the park!

201
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:04,752
<i>...sent Buster</i>
<i>to the fruit-laden arms...</i>

202
00:09:04,835 --> 00:09:07,046
I'm juicing now.
Would you like to join me?

203
00:09:07,129 --> 00:09:10,091
<i>...of Lucille's best frenemy,</i>
<i>Lucille Two...</i>

204
00:09:10,174 --> 00:09:12,385
I forgot. Your mother wouldn't allow it.

205
00:09:12,468 --> 00:09:14,345
<i>...who knew what buttons to push.</i>

206
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,722
Let's get juiced.

207
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:22,228
<i>So there were no Bluths at all</i>
<i>to testify on Lucille's behalf.</i>

208
00:09:22,311 --> 00:09:23,271
Any witness?

209
00:09:23,354 --> 00:09:25,565
Please tell me you're working
on a strategy for us.

210
00:09:26,732 --> 00:09:29,652
It's us now.
Well, we have Lucille Austero.

211
00:09:29,944 --> 00:09:33,322
She's the only one who showed.
I don't think that is good for us.

212
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:37,660
Nonsense. She owns the company now.
She's got as much to lose as I do.

213
00:09:38,035 --> 00:09:39,704
And she's a dear friend.

214
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:42,873
I'll do it myself, though.
I need this to go well.

215
00:09:42,957 --> 00:09:47,128
<i>And so it was Lucille who did</i>
<i>the questioning of her new star witness,</i>

216
00:09:47,211 --> 00:09:50,423
<i>although she was clearly green</i>
<i>at screening witnesses.</i>

217
00:09:50,506 --> 00:09:52,341
Thank you for coming to be my witness.

218
00:09:52,633 --> 00:09:54,343
You're such a large shareholder...

219
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:57,888
I've made a pun!

220
00:09:57,972 --> 00:10:01,017
How could I not do it
for my oldest friend?

221
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:04,312
Now I've gone and done a double.

222
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:07,273
A double like your pre-surgery chin.

223
00:10:07,648 --> 00:10:09,650
Or your post-breakfast drink.

224
00:10:09,734 --> 00:10:12,278
I wish you'd come to my rehab clinic.

225
00:10:12,361 --> 00:10:15,531
But anything to help
that Keystone Cop family of yours.

226
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:16,782
Keystone Cops?

227
00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:19,285
Your references are as fresh
as the wallpaper

228
00:10:19,368 --> 00:10:23,205
in the room of that pretend child
you've had all these years.

229
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:25,041
-But my friend--
-I shouldn't joke.

230
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:27,752
None of your family showed up,
you poor thing.

231
00:10:27,835 --> 00:10:30,296
This is such a black mark on all of you.

232
00:10:30,379 --> 00:10:32,340
You should know about black marks.

233
00:10:32,423 --> 00:10:34,759
Your pillow must look
like a Rorschach test.

234
00:10:34,842 --> 00:10:36,761
Not that there'd be anyone to see it.

235
00:10:37,595 --> 00:10:38,929
So as I was saying...

236
00:10:39,013 --> 00:10:42,600
<i>But unfortunately,</i>
<i>their 30-year passive-aggressive dance</i>

237
00:10:42,683 --> 00:10:44,727
<i>was losing some of its passive.</i>

238
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:46,937
As if everybody in this room couldn't tell

239
00:10:47,021 --> 00:10:50,358
how jealous and conniving you are,
my dear Lucille Austero.

240
00:10:50,441 --> 00:10:53,861
What I knew was that you were stealing
for years. We all did.

241
00:10:54,236 --> 00:10:56,947
That's why nobody was surprised
when you stole that boat.

242
00:10:57,031 --> 00:11:00,993
And I knew you couldn't wait to get
your liver-spotted claws into my company.

243
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:03,371
Says the woman whose liver can be spotted
from outer space.

244
00:11:03,454 --> 00:11:05,873
-No further questions!
-No further answers!

245
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:07,041
Am I done?

246
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:10,711
That's got to be our treasure chest.

247
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:11,879
You think it went well?

248
00:11:13,881 --> 00:11:14,882
I do.

249
00:11:18,803 --> 00:11:22,264
<i>Tobias and Lindsay drove to meet</i>
<i> their new friends for lunch.</i>

250
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:24,600
They are such a neat couple.

251
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:28,521
Are they neat? It's so fun to have
another couple to go out with.

252
00:11:28,604 --> 00:11:31,649
He's amazing.
He's so passionate about real issues.

253
00:11:31,732 --> 00:11:33,317
He's a real activist, like me.

254
00:11:33,401 --> 00:11:36,320
And she's a real actress, like me.

255
00:11:36,862 --> 00:11:38,656
She used to be in big movies,

256
00:11:38,739 --> 00:11:40,866
but then, like a lot of actors,
the teeth go.

257
00:11:41,575 --> 00:11:44,453
But she is the perfect age
to be a Hollywood actress.

258
00:11:44,745 --> 00:11:45,830
42.

259
00:11:45,913 --> 00:11:46,747
Is that all?

260
00:11:47,248 --> 00:11:50,584
Oh, I think this is the place.
It's a barter restaurant.

261
00:11:50,668 --> 00:11:52,294
Marky doesn't believe in money.

262
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:55,965
-Do I like barter?
-No, it means they don't deal with money.

263
00:11:56,507 --> 00:11:58,259
That's why I swiped that methadone tray.

264
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:02,513
What interesting friends we've made!

265
00:12:02,596 --> 00:12:05,141
I think this is
exactly what our marriage needed.

266
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:14,024
<i>Buster wasn't feeling so good</i>
<i>as he awoke hours later than he intended.</i>

267
00:12:14,108 --> 00:12:15,276
Well, that was a freebie.

268
00:12:17,319 --> 00:12:18,404
Mother's trial!

269
00:12:18,487 --> 00:12:21,240
Key witness coming through.

270
00:12:21,699 --> 00:12:23,325
I'm a key...

271
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:25,995
[soldier]
Play that song in the drizzling rain.

272
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:28,080
[soldiers]
Play that song in the drizzling rain.

273
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:34,044
<i>And Lindsay and Tobias joined</i>
<i>their new friends at C.W. Swappigan's,</i>

274
00:12:34,128 --> 00:12:36,964
<i>a chain that had sprung up</i>
<i>after the economic collapse.</i>

275
00:12:37,047 --> 00:12:41,218
We are like a Salvation Army meets
a soup kitchen, meets a gastro pub,

276
00:12:41,302 --> 00:12:44,555
meets a Marxist
or Leninist type social structure.

277
00:12:44,638 --> 00:12:48,350
These are things that you can order
and these are things that we will accept.

278
00:12:48,684 --> 00:12:51,479
As you see on the bottom,
we don't have the fish

279
00:12:51,562 --> 00:12:53,481
and we're not taking any more lava lamps.

280
00:12:54,315 --> 00:12:57,151
I can see this one's got
that deer-in-the-headlights look.

281
00:12:57,526 --> 00:12:59,945
Oh, no, he just took some methadone.

282
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:02,531
He thought he was driving
with a cocktail tray.

283
00:13:03,365 --> 00:13:06,994
Speaking of that, how about
mozzarella sticks for the table?

284
00:13:07,077 --> 00:13:10,289
Cocktail tray, light scratching,
for mozzarella sticks!

285
00:13:10,372 --> 00:13:11,999
Six, no sauce.

286
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:15,503
And maybe some sparkling water
for the table.

287
00:13:15,586 --> 00:13:17,755
I'm sorry, sir.
We're no longer taking hotel soaps.

288
00:13:18,756 --> 00:13:19,882
This is fun.

289
00:13:19,965 --> 00:13:22,134
It's just so refreshing to meet people

290
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:24,887
with real passion about changing
the status quo.

291
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:28,349
Lindsay and I don't have a single friend.

292
00:13:29,433 --> 00:13:30,726
Is the food here yet?

293
00:13:30,976 --> 00:13:32,645
I'm not hungry, but...

294
00:13:32,728 --> 00:13:34,021
[man] No cheese!

295
00:13:34,104 --> 00:13:35,940
-Look, it's butter!
-DeBrie...

296
00:13:39,735 --> 00:13:41,987
That's our butter.
We were gonna swap it for dessert.

297
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:45,616
<i>But Tobias interpreted this</i>
<i>as method one acting.</i>

298
00:13:45,699 --> 00:13:46,867
No, she's improvising.

299
00:13:47,409 --> 00:13:51,288
Yes, ma'am. You seem to be liking
that butter substitute at Swappigan's.

300
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:54,875
Yes, and what else could you swap for?

301
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:56,335
Yes, and...

302
00:13:57,044 --> 00:13:58,045
Oh, God.

303
00:13:58,128 --> 00:14:00,089
Oh, I'm out. She's too good.

304
00:14:00,714 --> 00:14:02,842
I don't know who my guy is.
I don't have a guy.

305
00:14:02,925 --> 00:14:05,135
No, she just likes butter.
Let's get you cleaned up.

306
00:14:05,219 --> 00:14:07,680
Marky, I'll take her.
You two just got here.

307
00:14:07,763 --> 00:14:09,348
Have a chat about. I'll clean her up.

308
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:12,601
-I'm sorry.
-Don't be.

309
00:14:12,977 --> 00:14:14,061
I love it here.

310
00:14:14,436 --> 00:14:16,313
My mother would hate this place.

311
00:14:16,397 --> 00:14:18,649
Lindsay, I have to tell you,
when I first met you,

312
00:14:18,732 --> 00:14:22,111
I thought you were one
of those typical, uptight,

313
00:14:22,194 --> 00:14:25,322
snobby, Newport Beach, vapid

314
00:14:25,406 --> 00:14:26,240
[shouts] nut-busters!

315
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:31,787
One of those monsters that lives
in a 10,000 square-foot house

316
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:33,497
that they destroyed the wetlands for.

317
00:14:33,581 --> 00:14:34,665
Those were wetlands?

318
00:14:35,499 --> 00:14:37,084
That explains our Thanksgiving miracle.

319
00:14:37,167 --> 00:14:39,128
{\an8}What do you mean, you didn't make dinner?

320
00:14:39,211 --> 00:14:41,964
I didn't realize it was Thursday.
There's got to be something here.

321
00:14:45,926 --> 00:14:46,760
Get it!

322
00:14:47,928 --> 00:14:49,096
Chase it into the oven!

323
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:50,931
Here, little ducky.

324
00:14:51,015 --> 00:14:52,641
{\an8}-That's a good duck.
-Good duck.

325
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:54,393
In you go.

326
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:58,647
This is going to be
the greatest Thanksgiving ever.

327
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:01,984
I actually do live in a fairly large house
right now.

328
00:15:02,276 --> 00:15:03,819
But we've never made a payment on it.

329
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:05,696
So you're sticking it to big banking?

330
00:15:05,779 --> 00:15:06,697
Yes.

331
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:09,575
In fact, I'm only in America
because a shaman told me

332
00:15:09,658 --> 00:15:13,329
that love would come to me when I accepted
who I am and didn't run away.

333
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:14,622
Sounds like a good shaman.

334
00:15:15,331 --> 00:15:17,666
He was the house shaman
at The Four Seasons, Mumbai,

335
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:20,210
so you figure he's got to be pretty good.

336
00:15:21,045 --> 00:15:23,172
And he turned into an ostrich at the end.

337
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:25,424
They're not gonna have that
at the Embassy Suites.

338
00:15:25,507 --> 00:15:28,636
That's funny.
I actually run an ostrich farm.

339
00:15:31,221 --> 00:15:33,474
[woman] ♪ <i>Coincidence... ♪</i>

340
00:15:33,557 --> 00:15:34,808
That's not a coincidence.

341
00:15:35,225 --> 00:15:37,895
<i>♪ Yes, it is ♪</i>

342
00:15:39,146 --> 00:15:42,733
Marky, I've got to tell you,
talking about these social issues,

343
00:15:42,816 --> 00:15:45,235
it's the first time I've felt like myself

344
00:15:45,527 --> 00:15:47,071
in a really long time.

345
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:51,200
That's because I say what I mean,
I do what I feel. No lies.

346
00:15:51,283 --> 00:15:54,411
<i>Lindsay felt guilty</i>
<i>because she had lied to her mother</i>

347
00:15:54,495 --> 00:15:58,207
<i>in her promise to testify at a trial</i>
<i>she now knew she'd miss.</i>

348
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:02,127
That's why my motto is,
"Live truthfully and skate through life."

349
00:16:02,211 --> 00:16:05,714
<i>Marky felt guilty</i>
<i>because truthfully, it wasn't his motto.</i>

350
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:08,217
<i>It was the motto</i>
<i>of a surf and skateboard company.</i>

351
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:10,386
Live truthfully. Skate through life.

352
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:13,681
That's amazing.

353
00:16:13,764 --> 00:16:18,060
I haven't felt this deep a connection
with someone in a long, long time.

354
00:16:22,731 --> 00:16:23,649
Other than DeBrie.

355
00:16:24,358 --> 00:16:25,776
I can't believe we just did that.

356
00:16:25,859 --> 00:16:27,736
I can't believe how little give
your teeth have.

357
00:16:28,195 --> 00:16:29,863
So where do you keep your ostriches?

358
00:16:33,117 --> 00:16:36,578
<i>And that's when Lindsay ran off</i>
<i>for a try at a new life.</i>

359
00:16:36,912 --> 00:16:40,082
<i>And Lucille waited after being tried</i>
<i>for her old one.</i>

360
00:16:40,165 --> 00:16:42,543
-Have you heard anything?
-Well, our cashier's pregnant.

361
00:16:42,793 --> 00:16:44,169
And she's not married.

362
00:16:44,461 --> 00:16:45,462
I mean about me.

363
00:16:45,713 --> 00:16:47,506
Oh, you're guilty. Three to five.

364
00:16:56,890 --> 00:17:00,894
<i>Lindsay ran off to a life</i>
<i>she felt was her destiny</i>

365
00:17:00,978 --> 00:17:03,147
<i>and the new lovers discovered each other,</i>

366
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:06,900
<i>the beautiful female body,</i>
<i>the horrible male.</i>

367
00:17:08,527 --> 00:17:11,530
Wow, that was so... fast.

368
00:17:12,114 --> 00:17:15,200
Thanks, but I didn't know how long
we'd be stuck in traffic, so...

369
00:17:15,826 --> 00:17:17,369
And it sounds like it's moving.

370
00:17:17,453 --> 00:17:18,287
Move it!

371
00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:21,123
-Come on! Let's go!
-Careful!

372
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:25,919
<i>And as they drove, they learned</i>
<i>so much about each other.</i>

373
00:17:26,003 --> 00:17:29,173
I was always just in such a rush
to grow up and change this world.

374
00:17:29,256 --> 00:17:32,593
Foolishly, the teeth I pulled
were my adult teeth.

375
00:17:32,676 --> 00:17:35,763
I mean, they're just chewing tools.
I don't care about looks.

376
00:17:36,138 --> 00:17:38,015
But you find me pretty though, right?

377
00:17:38,807 --> 00:17:40,768
No. I have no idea what you look like.

378
00:17:40,851 --> 00:17:42,770
I have this condition
called face blindness.

379
00:17:43,437 --> 00:17:45,230
I mean, I can tell you're a woman.

380
00:17:45,314 --> 00:17:46,607
Oh, stop!

381
00:17:46,982 --> 00:17:50,235
But honestly, no,
all I see is, like, eyes and nose,

382
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:52,071
you know, hair, ears and...

383
00:17:52,362 --> 00:17:56,533
You know, my shaman told me
I should stop caring about appearances.

384
00:17:56,617 --> 00:17:59,620
You know, my whole life,
that's all anyone has ever praised,

385
00:17:59,703 --> 00:18:01,371
all my mom ever cared about.

386
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:04,166
Because I'm really pretty.

387
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:07,586
I just thought I'd tell you that
so the story made sense.

388
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:08,754
I don't care.

389
00:18:09,296 --> 00:18:11,840
But I guess it's kind of karma
that I ended up with someone

390
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:14,468
who wanted to make love to me
no matter what I look like.

391
00:18:14,802 --> 00:18:16,637
I also wanted to make sure
you weren't a dude.

392
00:18:17,304 --> 00:18:18,931
I can tell with voices usually,

393
00:18:19,014 --> 00:18:22,726
but some guys, they'll fool you
if that's what they want to do.

394
00:18:24,394 --> 00:18:25,354
Hey.

395
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,357
Are you smiling at me?

396
00:18:29,566 --> 00:18:31,610
<i>Buster wasn't smiling either</i>

397
00:18:31,693 --> 00:18:33,946
<i>when he finally made it</i>
<i>to the food courthouse.</i>

398
00:18:34,029 --> 00:18:36,782
-Is it over?
-No, the crab fest just started.

399
00:18:38,492 --> 00:18:40,702
Oh, ma'am, is there a verdict

400
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:42,621
in the "my mother stole
the <i>Queen Mary"</i> thing?

401
00:18:42,704 --> 00:18:44,289
It's all up on the dailies board.

402
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:49,711
The fish is frozen here. It's frozen!

403
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:52,756
Do you really want to spend $30
on frozen fish?

404
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:56,802
Buster! Where were you?
This is all your fault!

405
00:18:56,885 --> 00:18:58,887
-I was making a bed, two beds--
-Save it!

406
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:01,223
I can smell the cran-apple on you
from here.

407
00:19:02,057 --> 00:19:03,183
When are you coming home?

408
00:19:03,267 --> 00:19:04,810
I'm serving three to five.

409
00:19:05,602 --> 00:19:08,147
I hope your juicy blender-bender
was worth it.

410
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:10,858
Don't come to visit me
because I won't see you.

411
00:19:10,941 --> 00:19:12,526
And good luck with your night terrors.

412
00:19:12,901 --> 00:19:15,904
Now no one will be there
to hear your screams!

413
00:19:17,197 --> 00:19:18,365
Won't miss it!

414
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:23,203
Where do I go?

415
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:25,873
What do I do? Where do I go?

416
00:19:26,582 --> 00:19:28,000
Where did you get that pirate hat?

417
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:30,752
<i>And as Buster contemplated a new start,</i>

418
00:19:31,128 --> 00:19:32,754
<i>Lindsay let her husband know</i>

419
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:35,632
<i>that their new start had reached</i>
<i>a newer end.</i>

420
00:19:35,716 --> 00:19:37,885
I left. I guess you noticed.

421
00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:42,848
But I'm sorry.
I really do care about you, Tobias.

422
00:19:42,931 --> 00:19:46,393
But we were trying to save something
that just couldn't be saved.

423
00:19:46,894 --> 00:19:49,271
And I have to follow my shaman's advice.

424
00:19:50,606 --> 00:19:53,859
I have to be true to myself for once.

425
00:19:54,902 --> 00:19:55,819
And Marky,

426
00:19:56,403 --> 00:19:58,572
he sees me for who I really am.

427
00:19:59,281 --> 00:20:00,741
-He respects me--
-Come on, lady!

428
00:20:00,824 --> 00:20:03,243
You want to wrap this up?
My lady needs to call her loser ex.

429
00:20:04,453 --> 00:20:06,872
Marky, it's me. It's Lindsay.

430
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:10,584
Oh! Thought you were taking a dump?

431
00:20:10,667 --> 00:20:13,128
I must have scared the [bleep]
out of that lady in the bathroom

432
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:15,297
when I threw the door open
and told her I loved her.

433
00:20:19,426 --> 00:20:20,719
He loves me?

434
00:20:21,553 --> 00:20:22,846
Sorry. I don't love you.

435
00:20:24,556 --> 00:20:28,518
