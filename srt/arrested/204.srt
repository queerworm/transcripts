1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:02,502
[narrator] 
NOW THE STORY

2
00:00:02,502 --> 00:00:04,212
OF A WEALTHY FAMILY 
WHO LOST EVERYTHING...

3
00:00:04,212 --> 00:00:05,630
AND THE ONE SON 
WHO HAD NO CHOICE...

4
00:00:05,630 --> 00:00:07,132
BUT TO KEEP THEM ALL TOGETHER.

5
00:00:13,763 --> 00:00:15,848
IT'S ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT.

6
00:00:17,267 --> 00:00:19,102
[narrator] 
MICHAEL WAS ADJUSTING TO HIS

7
00:00:19,102 --> 00:00:22,605
NEW POSITION AS VICE PRESIDENT, 
WHICH MEANT DOING THE WORK OF

8
00:00:22,605 --> 00:00:24,524
THE PRESIDENT, HIS BROTHER GOB.

9
00:00:24,524 --> 00:00:26,442
- MICHAEL. 
- HEY.

10
00:00:26,442 --> 00:00:29,320
- SO, DID YOU SEE 
THE NEW POOF?

11
00:00:31,156 --> 00:00:33,366
- HIS NAME'S GARY, AND WE DON'T 
NEED ANY MORE LAWSUITS.

12
00:00:33,366 --> 00:00:34,950
- NO, I WAS TALKING 
ABOUT THE MAGAZINE--

13
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:36,744
WAIT. 
GARY'S GAY?

14
00:00:36,744 --> 00:00:38,454
- YEAH.

15
00:00:38,454 --> 00:00:40,290
- UH-OH. HE'S GONNA THINK 
I WAS COMING ON TO HIM.

16
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:41,749
YOU'VE GOT A NICE MOUTH.

17
00:00:41,749 --> 00:00:43,834
I'D KILL FOR THAT ASS.

18
00:00:43,834 --> 00:00:45,878
OKAY, THE CHAIR'S 
NOT DOING IT NOW,

19
00:00:45,878 --> 00:00:47,213
BUT LATELY 
IT'S BEEN GIVING OUT

20
00:00:47,213 --> 00:00:49,549
AS SOON AS I LEAN BACK.

21
00:00:49,549 --> 00:00:51,467
ANYWAY, I WAS TALKING 
ABOUT POOF MAGAZINE,

22
00:00:51,467 --> 00:00:53,469
THE MAGAZINE FOR MAGICIANS.

23
00:00:53,469 --> 00:00:55,930
THIS GUY TONY WONDER BAKES 
HIMSELF INTO A LOAF OF BREAD AND

24
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:58,391
POPS OUT OF A GIANT SANDWICH... 
TO FEED THE TROOPS.

25
00:00:59,975 --> 00:01:01,519
I HAD THAT IDEA 
10 MONTHS AGO.

26
00:01:01,519 --> 00:01:03,563
- YOU HAD THAT IDEA? 
- WELL, BASICALLY.

27
00:01:03,563 --> 00:01:05,940
I WAS GONNA BOIL MYSELF ALIVE 
INTO A CHOWDER AND THEN BE

28
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:07,942
LADLED INTO A GIANT CAULDRON...

29
00:01:07,942 --> 00:01:09,610
TO ENTERTAIN 
AND FEED THE FIREMEN.

30
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:10,986
- THAT'S PRETTY CLOSE.

31
00:01:10,986 --> 00:01:13,156
- I SHOULD BE IN THIS POOF!

32
00:01:13,156 --> 00:01:15,491
[phone rings]

33
00:01:15,491 --> 00:01:16,784
- MICHAEL BLUTH.

34
00:01:16,784 --> 00:01:18,453
- HE FOUND HIM. 
ICE FOUND YOUR FATHER.

35
00:01:18,453 --> 00:01:20,163
[narrator] 
MICHAEL HAD RECENTLY HAD HIRED

36
00:01:20,163 --> 00:01:21,456
A BOUNTY HUNTER...

37
00:01:21,456 --> 00:01:23,208
TO TRACK DOWN 
HIS FUGITIVE FATHER.

38
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:24,709
- WH-WHERE?

39
00:01:24,709 --> 00:01:26,377
- HE'S COMING OVER HERE AT 5:00 
TO TELL US.

40
00:01:26,377 --> 00:01:28,546
BUT HE WANTS 
TO GET PAID FIRST.

41
00:01:28,546 --> 00:01:30,047
- DAD GOES BACK TO JAIL,

42
00:01:30,047 --> 00:01:31,757
I CAN BE CLEARED, 
I CAN BE PRESIDENT AGAIN.

43
00:01:31,757 --> 00:01:33,801
- AND I'M HALFWAY TO 
GETTING OUT OF THIS OFFICE AND

44
00:01:33,801 --> 00:01:34,927
INTO A STEAMING BOWL OF SOUP.

45
00:01:34,927 --> 00:01:35,970
- EVERYBODY WINS. 
- YEAH.

46
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:37,347
- OSCAR, CLOSE IT.

47
00:01:37,347 --> 00:01:39,140
YOU LOOK LIKE THE WINDOW 
OF A BUTCHER SHOP.

48
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:40,808
THANK GOD I CAN 
FINALLY GET RID OF HIM.

49
00:01:40,808 --> 00:01:42,810
- I'LL SEE YOU AT 5:00, MOM.

50
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:45,062
[narrator] 
MICHAEL THEN HEADED DOWN

51
00:01:45,062 --> 00:01:46,981
TO THE FROZEN BANANA STAND...

52
00:01:46,981 --> 00:01:48,899
WHERE HIS SON 
WAS SUPPOSED TO BE WORKING.

53
00:01:48,899 --> 00:01:51,152
- IT JUST SEEMS LIKE EVERY TIME 
WE WANNA BE TOGETHER,

54
00:01:51,152 --> 00:01:53,196
YOUR FATHER COMES ALONG--

55
00:01:53,196 --> 00:01:55,615
- HEY, GUYS. WHAT'S GOING ON? 
WHY'S THE BANANA STAND CLOSED?

56
00:01:55,615 --> 00:01:57,117
- OH, ANN CAME TO SEE ME,

57
00:01:57,117 --> 00:01:58,868
SO I THOUGHT I'D TAKE 
A LITTLE BREAK.

58
00:01:58,868 --> 00:02:01,329
CAN WE TALK ABOUT THIS LATER? 
- SURE. NO PROBLEM.

59
00:02:01,329 --> 00:02:02,663
JUST, LET'S KEEP 
THE PHONE ON.

60
00:02:02,663 --> 00:02:04,165
OKAY, PAL? GREAT.

61
00:02:04,165 --> 00:02:05,875
HEY, YOU. 
[beep]

62
00:02:07,752 --> 00:02:09,795
- SEE? THAT'S A PERFECT 
EXAMPLE OF HOW YOUR FATHER'S

63
00:02:09,795 --> 00:02:11,172
ALWAYS INTERRUP--

64
00:02:11,172 --> 00:02:14,091
[vibrating]

65
00:02:15,218 --> 00:02:17,178
- I'M SORRY. 
[beep]

66
00:02:17,178 --> 00:02:18,679
HELLO.

67
00:02:18,679 --> 00:02:20,390
- HEY, BUDDY. 
THEY FOUND YOUR GRANDFATHER.

68
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:21,724
THAT'S WHAT 
I WANTED TO TELL YOU.

69
00:02:21,724 --> 00:02:23,559
- THAT'S GREAT.

70
00:02:23,559 --> 00:02:25,645
- I DIDN'T WANNA SAY THAT 
WHEN YOU WERE TALKING TO EGG.

71
00:02:25,645 --> 00:02:26,812
- I'M STILL TALKING WITH ANN.

72
00:02:26,812 --> 00:02:28,564
- OH, SHE'S STILL GOIN'?

73
00:02:28,564 --> 00:02:30,525
LISTEN, I'LL TALK TO YOU LATER. 
I'M VERY EXCITED.

74
00:02:30,525 --> 00:02:31,859
- [mutters] 
THAT'S GOOD.

75
00:02:31,859 --> 00:02:33,819
[beep]

76
00:02:33,819 --> 00:02:37,865
- I THINK WE SHOULD BREAK UP.

77
00:02:37,865 --> 00:02:39,325
- [coughing sob]

78
00:02:39,325 --> 00:02:41,286
[narrator] 
THE BOUNTY HUNTER, MEANWHILE,

79
00:02:41,286 --> 00:02:43,204
WAS EAGER TO IMPRESS 
THE FAMILY ATTORNEY.

80
00:02:43,204 --> 00:02:45,290
- I CANNOT BELIEVE 
THAT YOU MADE THESE.

81
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:46,957
[narrator] 
INDEED, ICE HAD ALWAYS

82
00:02:46,957 --> 00:02:49,043
BOUNTY-HUNTED 
TO SUPPORT HIS FIRST LOVE--

83
00:02:49,043 --> 00:02:50,378
PARTY-PLANNING.

84
00:02:50,378 --> 00:02:51,879
AND LINDSAY 
WAS STILL HOPING

85
00:02:51,879 --> 00:02:54,131
TO SCORE A DATE WITH HIM.

86
00:02:54,131 --> 00:02:56,634
- I DON'T SUPPOSE 
YOU'D BE INTERESTED IN

87
00:02:56,634 --> 00:02:58,386
CATERING AN AFFAIR WITH ME.

88
00:02:58,386 --> 00:03:00,721
- WELL, WHEN YOU GET 
A FULL GUEST LIST,

89
00:03:00,721 --> 00:03:02,097
LET ME KNOW.

90
00:03:02,097 --> 00:03:04,642
- WHY CAN'T I DO THIS 
ANYMORE?

91
00:03:04,642 --> 00:03:06,352
- THAT'S GOT TO BOTHER YOU, 
HUH, DAD?

92
00:03:06,352 --> 00:03:08,563
I MEAN, SHE'S FLIRTING 
RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU.

93
00:03:08,563 --> 00:03:10,856
- HMM? 
OH! NO.

94
00:03:10,856 --> 00:03:13,943
I AM SURPRISED, THOUGH, 
THAT SHE'S GOING AFTER SOMEBODY

95
00:03:13,943 --> 00:03:16,028
SO SIMILAR TO MY OWN TYPE.

96
00:03:16,028 --> 00:03:20,074
BUT I SUPPOSE WE ALL DO EXPOSE 
OUR INNER DESIRES, DON'T WE?

97
00:03:20,074 --> 00:03:22,076
- I THINK YOU JUST DID.

98
00:03:22,076 --> 00:03:23,994
- NO, I DIDN'T.

99
00:03:25,371 --> 00:03:27,122
- IS THERE ANY WAY 
I CAN DIVORCE THEM?

100
00:03:27,122 --> 00:03:28,749
- OH, SURE. 
IT'S CALLED EMANCIPATION.

101
00:03:28,749 --> 00:03:30,668
BUT YOU'VE GOT TO PROVE 
THAT YOU'RE LIVING

102
00:03:30,668 --> 00:03:32,587
IN AN UNSTABLE ENVIRONMENT.

103
00:03:32,587 --> 00:03:34,505
- BOTH MY PARENTS ARE TRYING 
TO HAVE AFFAIRS.

104
00:03:34,505 --> 00:03:36,173
OF COURSE, 
THEY HAVEN'T SUCCEEDED YET.

105
00:03:36,173 --> 00:03:38,092
- IF THEY DO, I COULD HAVE YOU 
OUT OF THIS HOUSE,

106
00:03:38,092 --> 00:03:39,802
ON THE STREET, IN A MONTH.

107
00:03:39,802 --> 00:03:41,596
- SWEET! 
- MM-HMM.

108
00:03:41,596 --> 00:03:43,097
[narrator] 
SOON, MICHAEL ARRIVED,

109
00:03:43,097 --> 00:03:44,682
AND ICE BEGAN HIS PRESENTATION.

110
00:03:44,682 --> 00:03:46,476
- WHEN WORD GOT OUT 
THAT HE WAS BUILDING HOUSES

111
00:03:46,476 --> 00:03:47,727
FOR SADDAM HUSSEIN,

112
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:49,520
HE ESCAPED TO MEXICO WHERE,

113
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,897
AS YOU KNOW, HE WAS ARRESTED 
AND INTERRED IN A LOCAL PRISON.

114
00:03:51,897 --> 00:03:53,649
UNTIL HE WAS KILLED 
BY THIS GUARD.

115
00:03:53,649 --> 00:03:56,026
BODY WAS HELD FOR SIX DAYS 
WITHIN THE PRISON WALLS WHEN--

116
00:03:56,026 --> 00:03:57,445
- I'M SORRY-- 
HE KILLED A GUARD?

117
00:03:57,445 --> 00:03:59,739
- NO, THE GUARD KILLED HIM.

118
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:01,949
HE'S DEAD. 
BURIED IN MEXICO.

119
00:04:01,949 --> 00:04:03,618
- [screams]

120
00:04:03,618 --> 00:04:06,496
- UH, H-HOLD ON. 
HOW DO WE KNOW THIS IS TRUE?

121
00:04:06,496 --> 00:04:08,456
- BECAUSE I HAVE HERE 
HIS DENTAL RECORDS,

122
00:04:08,456 --> 00:04:10,082
HIS DEATH CERTIFICATE,

123
00:04:10,082 --> 00:04:11,751
AND A POLITICAL CARTOON

124
00:04:11,751 --> 00:04:13,753
FROM A LEADING 
MEXICAN PUBLICATION.

125
00:04:15,004 --> 00:04:17,172
OKAY, AGAIN, 
I'M A CATERER,

126
00:04:17,172 --> 00:04:20,510
SO IF YOU DO HAVE 
ANY FAMILY EVENTS--

127
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:22,803
WEDDINGS...WAKES--

128
00:04:22,803 --> 00:04:25,640
I'LL LEAVE MY CARD.

129
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:28,183
- IS IT TRUE?

130
00:04:28,183 --> 00:04:30,144
IS HE REALLY GONE?

131
00:04:31,354 --> 00:04:33,398
- OW. 
- JUST CHECKING.

132
00:04:33,398 --> 00:04:36,692
- THESE ARE HIS TEETH. 
HE HAD SUCH PERFECT TEETH.

133
00:04:36,692 --> 00:04:39,570
IT WAS THAT GLISTEN. 
- HE SWORE BY THAT GLISTEN.

134
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:41,196
- I CAN STILL HEAR HIM NOW:

135
00:04:41,196 --> 00:04:43,533
"WHO LEFT THE CAP 
OFF MY-- [bleep] GLISTEN?"

136
00:04:43,533 --> 00:04:45,576
- IT'S ALL HITTING ME NOW.

137
00:04:45,576 --> 00:04:47,620
THIS IS REALLY HAPPENING.

138
00:04:48,996 --> 00:04:51,123
ALL THIS 
AWFUL FUNERAL STUFF!

139
00:04:51,123 --> 00:04:53,709
THE WILL. 
WE HAVE TO GET THE WILL.

140
00:04:53,709 --> 00:04:55,795
I DON'T KNOW 
IF ENOUGH TIME HAS PASSED.

141
00:04:55,795 --> 00:04:58,047
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING.

142
00:04:58,047 --> 00:05:00,132
IS IT IN YOUR CAR, BARRY? 
I'M GONNA THROW UP!

143
00:05:00,132 --> 00:05:02,385
CHECK THE CAR, BARRY. 
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING!

144
00:05:02,385 --> 00:05:04,595
- THE WILL IS NOT HERE.

145
00:05:04,595 --> 00:05:06,180
THE WILL IS AT MY OFFICE,

146
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:08,057
NEXT TO THE HOT PLATE 
WITH THE FRAYED WIRES.

147
00:05:08,057 --> 00:05:09,934
I DIDN'T, UH-- 
IT WASN'T--

148
00:05:09,934 --> 00:05:11,436
[narrator] 
IN FACT, BARRY HAD LOST

149
00:05:11,436 --> 00:05:13,062
GEORGE SR.'s WILL.

150
00:05:13,062 --> 00:05:14,522
- HOW DID I GET HERE?

151
00:05:14,522 --> 00:05:16,774
OH, MY GOD, LUCILLE. 
HE IS GONE!

152
00:05:16,774 --> 00:05:18,150
- WE HAVE TO HAVE A WAKE.

153
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:19,610
[narrator] 
MAEBY WAS UPSET, BUT SAW

154
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:21,195
A CHANCE TO FIX UP HER MOTHER.

155
00:05:21,195 --> 00:05:23,238
- MAYBE WE COULD GET ICE 
TO CATER IT OR SOMETHING--

156
00:05:23,238 --> 00:05:25,366
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING!

157
00:05:25,366 --> 00:05:28,786
- WE DON'T EVEN HAVE A BODY. 
- I WILL BE MY FATHER'S BODY.

158
00:05:29,704 --> 00:05:31,372
I'LL BE THE ONE BURIED.

159
00:05:31,372 --> 00:05:33,958
BECAUSE HE LOVED MAGIC 
SO VERY MUCH.

160
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:35,835
-I DON'T THINK GOB 
KNOWS WHAT HE'S SAYING.

161
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:37,336
- I KNOW EXACTLY 
WHAT I'M SAYING.

162
00:05:37,336 --> 00:05:39,880
I WILL BE BURIED 
IN MY FATHER'S PLACE,

163
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:43,426
AND THEN, ONE WEEK LATER, 
I WILL EMERGE FROM THE GRAVE..

164
00:05:43,426 --> 00:05:45,761
IN ONE OF 
THE GREATEST ILLUSIONS EVER!

165
00:05:45,761 --> 00:05:47,346
- THIS ABOUT GETTING INTO POOF?

166
00:05:47,346 --> 00:05:49,974
- I MEAN, HOW DOES THAT 
NOT GET ME A COVER?

167
00:05:49,974 --> 00:05:52,017
[keys jingling] 
- BUSTER!

168
00:05:52,017 --> 00:05:53,644
WE CAN'T TELL HIM ABOUT THIS!

169
00:05:53,644 --> 00:05:55,646
- I THINK THE BOY'S 
BEEN LIED TO ENOUGH.

170
00:05:55,646 --> 00:05:58,107
- YOU WEREN'T HERE 
FOR THE PARAKEET, OSCAR.

171
00:05:58,107 --> 00:05:59,650
[narrator] 
AS A CHILD, BUSTER HAD

172
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:02,027
A BELOVED PARAKEET... 
WHO, AFTER LANDING ON

173
00:06:02,027 --> 00:06:04,489
THEIR HOUSEKEEPER ROSA'S WIG, 
FLEW AWAY...

174
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:06,866
WHEN SHE TOOK OUT THE TRASH 
AND INTO A TRANSFORMER.

175
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:08,200
[electrical zap]

176
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,577
WHEN BUSTER FOUND OUT,

177
00:06:09,577 --> 00:06:12,037
HE DESTROYED 
THE FAMILY'S KITCHEN,

178
00:06:12,037 --> 00:06:15,583
BELIEVING THIS TO BE 
WHERE ROSA LIVED.

179
00:06:17,334 --> 00:06:18,669
- WHOA.

180
00:06:18,669 --> 00:06:20,505
- WHAT ARE YOU 
DOING HOME?

181
00:06:20,505 --> 00:06:22,548
- THE ARMY HAD HALF A DAY.

182
00:06:22,548 --> 00:06:24,216
ARE YOU GUYS 
PLANNING A PARTY?

183
00:06:24,216 --> 00:06:25,676
- YES.

184
00:06:25,676 --> 00:06:27,302
IT'S YOUR FATHER'S BIRTHDAY,

185
00:06:27,302 --> 00:06:31,181
WHICH, COINCIDENTALLY, IS... 
MY BIRTHDAY.

186
00:06:31,181 --> 00:06:33,476
- BECAUSE YOU'RE TWINS. 
[chuckles]

187
00:06:33,476 --> 00:06:34,894
WELL, I'VE GOT 
SOME SHOPPING TO DO.

188
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:36,228

[narrator] 
GEORGE MICHAEL, MEANWHILE,

190
00:06:38,063 --> 00:06:41,275
HAD JUST BEEN BROKEN UP WITH 
BY HIS FIRST GIRLFRIEND...

191
00:06:41,275 --> 00:06:43,444
AND WAS ON HIS WAY HOME.

192
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:49,450
AND HE WENT TO HIS FATHER 
FOR COMFORT.

193
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:50,743
- DAD?

194
00:06:53,621 --> 00:06:56,749
- I'VE GOT SOME BAD NEWS.

195
00:06:56,749 --> 00:06:59,168
- WHAT? WHAT? 
IS ANN TELLING EVERYONE?

196
00:06:59,168 --> 00:07:01,629
- IT'S YOUR GRANDFATHER.

197
00:07:01,629 --> 00:07:04,465
APPARENTLY, HE'S DEAD. 
- ARE YOU OKAY?

198
00:07:04,465 --> 00:07:06,300
- YEAH. 
YEAH, I THINK SO.

199
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:08,343
UH, I'M SORRY. 
WHAT WERE YOU SAYING ABOUT ANN?

200
00:07:08,343 --> 00:07:10,012
[narrator] 
GEORGE MICHAEL

201
00:07:10,012 --> 00:07:12,056
DIDN'T WANT TO BURDEN HIS FATHER 
WITH HIS BREAK-UP.

202
00:07:12,056 --> 00:07:13,599
- NOTHING. I JUST--

203
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:16,226
I BROKE UP WITH HER. 
IT'S NO BIG DEAL.

204
00:07:16,226 --> 00:07:17,937
- REALLY? 
- YEAH.

205
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:20,981
- ARE YOU OKAY? 
- ME? I'M GREAT.

206
00:07:20,981 --> 00:07:22,983
- YEAH? 
- I'M GREAT.

207
00:07:22,983 --> 00:07:25,486
- GOOD. YEAH. 
SHE WASN'T FOR US.

208
00:07:25,486 --> 00:07:27,279
- NO, SHE'S-- 
SHE'S A GREAT GIRL.

209
00:07:27,279 --> 00:07:28,656
- FOR THOSE OTHER GUYS.

210
00:07:28,656 --> 00:07:30,324
- YOU THINK THERE ARE 
OTHER GUYS?

211
00:07:30,324 --> 00:07:32,993
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING. 
COME HERE.

212
00:07:34,995 --> 00:07:36,997
- HEY, BROTHER.

213
00:07:36,997 --> 00:07:38,999
YOU WANTED TO SEE ME? 
- BUSTER, YEAH.

214
00:07:38,999 --> 00:07:41,627
I NEED YOU TO HELP ME WITH 
THIS ILLUSION I'M WORKING ON.

215
00:07:41,627 --> 00:07:44,004
- OH, FOR DAD'S BIRTHDAY.

216
00:07:44,004 --> 00:07:46,507
- YEAH. 
FOR DAD'S BIRTHDAY.

217
00:07:46,507 --> 00:07:49,844
SO, LOOK, I'M GONNA 
GET IN THIS COFFIN.

218
00:07:49,844 --> 00:07:54,014
WHAT I'M GONNA NEED YOU TO DO 
IS TO SPIN IT AROUND...

219
00:07:54,014 --> 00:07:57,977
TO SHOW EVERYBODY 
THAT THERE'S NO TRAP DOOR.

220
00:07:57,977 --> 00:08:01,021
THEN I'M GONNA ESCAPE 
OUT THE TRAP DOOR.

221
00:08:01,021 --> 00:08:04,066
- OOH! 
- YOU CLOSE THE TRAP DOOR,

222
00:08:04,066 --> 00:08:07,361
BRING IN THE PALLBEARERS 
AND BURY AN EMPTY BOX.

223
00:08:07,361 --> 00:08:10,030
- SO IT'S A HOAX.

224
00:08:10,030 --> 00:08:11,532
BUT WHY ARE YOU 
DOING A COFFIN TRICK

225
00:08:11,532 --> 00:08:13,075
ON DAD'S BIRTHDAY?

226
00:08:13,075 --> 00:08:14,952
- BLACK HUMOR.

227
00:08:14,952 --> 00:08:19,540
SAY, "HEY, DAD, LOOK AT YOU. 
YOU'RE... A YEAR OLDER...

228
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:23,711
AND A YEAR CLOSER TO DEATH."

229
00:08:23,711 --> 00:08:27,089
- OH, YEAH, 
I GUESS THAT'S KINDA FUNNY.

230
00:08:27,089 --> 00:08:30,384
OKAY, BUT YOU HAVE TO 
DO A FAVOR FOR ME.

231
00:08:30,384 --> 00:08:33,387
I'M NOT REALLY IN THE ARMY, 
AND I TOLD MOM I WAS,

232
00:08:33,387 --> 00:08:34,805
BUT I CAN'T GO 
TO A FAMILY EVENT

233
00:08:34,805 --> 00:08:36,348
WITHOUT AN ARMY UNIFORM.

234
00:08:36,348 --> 00:08:37,850
- OH, YEAH. 
I USED TO BE A STRIPPER.

235
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:39,184
- STRIPPERS DON'T WEAR CLOTHES.

236
00:08:39,184 --> 00:08:41,061
- NOT AT THE END OF THE SHOW.

237
00:08:41,061 --> 00:08:44,106
- YOU CAN WEAR STRIPPER CLOTHES 
WHEN YOU'RE NOT STRIPPING?

238
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:47,527
- YOU TELL ME.

239
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:49,486
[narrator] 
GEORGE MICHAEL WENT FOR A WALK

240
00:08:49,486 --> 00:08:51,238
IN THE ADJOINING LOT...

241
00:08:51,238 --> 00:08:53,824
TO GRIEVE BOTH LOSSES 
IN PRIVATE,

242
00:08:53,824 --> 00:08:57,286
AND HE MADE 
AN INTERESTING DISCOVERY.

243
00:08:59,163 --> 00:09:02,457
- POP-POP? 
- HIDE ME.

244
00:09:02,457 --> 00:09:05,670
DON'T TURN IN POP-POP. 
HELP POP-POP.

245
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:12,760
[narrator] 
GEORGE MICHAEL

246
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:15,888
SNUCK HIS GRANDFATHER INTO THE 
ATTIC AND HELPED HIM CLEAN UP.

247
00:09:15,888 --> 00:09:17,222
- WOW, THEY'RE PERFECT.

248
00:09:17,222 --> 00:09:19,600
- YEARS OF BRUSHING 
WITH GLISTEN.

249
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,894
LISTEN, YOU CAN'T 
TELL ANYBODY I'M UP HERE.

250
00:09:21,894 --> 00:09:23,563
YOU HAVE TO PROTECT ME.

251
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:25,522
- YEAH, I KNOW. I JUST-- 
I CAN'T NOT TELL MY FATHER.

252
00:09:25,522 --> 00:09:27,692
- I'M YOUR GRANDFATHER. 
I WENT THROUGH HELL TO GET HERE.

253
00:09:27,692 --> 00:09:28,734
[narrator] 
HE HAD.

254
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:30,360
AFTER BEING ARRESTED,

255
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:32,947
HE FOUND A LOOPHOLE 
IN THE MEXICAN JUDICIAL SYSTEM.

256
00:09:32,947 --> 00:09:34,949
- I HAVE, UH-- 
I HAVE MONEY.

257
00:09:36,366 --> 00:09:38,452
[narrator] 
THE MEXICAN AUTHORITIES...

258
00:09:38,452 --> 00:09:40,079
EVEN ATTEMPTED 
TO FAKE HIS FUNERAL,

259
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:42,039
ALTHOUGH IT WAS 
A LESS-THAN-PERFECT DECEPTION.

260
00:09:42,039 --> 00:09:43,833
[chattering, shouting]

261
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:46,126
- ANYWAY, I WAS HALFWAY DOWN 
TO PANAMA, AND I SAW SOMETHING

262
00:09:46,126 --> 00:09:47,670
IN THE LOCAL PAPER.

263
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:49,630
[narrator] 
WHAT HE SAW WAS A STORY...

264
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:51,215
ABOUT HIS WIFE 
GIVING MOUTH-TO-MOUTH

265
00:09:51,215 --> 00:09:52,883
TO A HOMELESS MAN.

266
00:09:52,883 --> 00:09:55,970
BUT HE KNEW THE TRUTH: 
SHE WAS KISSING HIS BROTHER.

267
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:02,517
- WELL, I UNDERSTAND 
WHAT THAT FEELS LIKE.

268
00:10:02,517 --> 00:10:04,729
I WAS DUMPED TODAY.

269
00:10:04,729 --> 00:10:07,147
I CAN'T TELL DAD HOW UPSET I AM 
ABOUT IT BECAUSE HE'LL THINK

270
00:10:07,147 --> 00:10:08,858
I SHOULD JUST BE 
UPSET ABOUT YOU.

271
00:10:08,858 --> 00:10:10,150
- HE WOULDN'T BE WRONG.

272
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:11,902
- [mutters] 
WHAT?

273
00:10:11,902 --> 00:10:14,822
- SEEMS LIKE WE'RE 
GOING THROUGH THE SAME THING.

274
00:10:14,822 --> 00:10:17,199
WHY DON'T WE 
KEEP EACH OTHER'S SECRETS?

275
00:10:17,199 --> 00:10:18,533
- YEAH, OKAY.

276
00:10:19,994 --> 00:10:22,412
- LISTEN, 
IF YOU PASS A MINI-MART,

277
00:10:22,412 --> 00:10:23,706
POP-POP GETS A TREAT?

278
00:10:25,415 --> 00:10:27,001
[narrator] 
THE NEXT MORNING,

279
00:10:27,001 --> 00:10:29,128
MICHAEL RAN INTO HIS SON 
DOING SOMETHING SUSPICIOUS.

280
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:30,587
- MORNING! 
- HI.

281
00:10:30,587 --> 00:10:32,131
- WHERE ARE YOU GOIN' 
WITH THAT FOOD?

282
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:33,924
- I WAS JUST GONNA EAT

283
00:10:33,924 --> 00:10:36,260
SOME OF MY GRANDFATHER'S 
FAVORITE FOODS IN MY ROOM.

284
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:38,763
IT'S THE FORM 
THAT MY GRIEF IS TAKING.

285
00:10:38,763 --> 00:10:40,765
- OKAY.

286
00:10:44,268 --> 00:10:47,312
I THINK GEORGE MICHAEL'S 
HIDING ANN IN THE ATTIC.

287
00:10:47,312 --> 00:10:49,273
- [scoffs] 
FROM WHO, THE NAZIS?

288
00:10:49,273 --> 00:10:52,151
- NO, HIS GIRLFRIEND, 
FROM ME.

289
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:54,611
I JUST CAUGHT HIM SNEAKING UP 
TO HER IN THE ATTIC,

290
00:10:54,611 --> 00:10:57,865
AND HE CLEARLY DID SO BECAUSE HE 
THINKS I DON'T APPROVE.

291
00:10:57,865 --> 00:11:00,868
I THINK I'M GONNA 
INVITE HER TO THE WAKE.

292
00:11:00,868 --> 00:11:02,327
WHY MAKE HIM HIDE? 
WHY DO TO HIM WHAT--

293
00:11:02,327 --> 00:11:03,996
- [sniffles]

294
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:07,374
- WHY DO TO HIM 
WHAT DAD USED TO DO TO ME?

295
00:11:07,374 --> 00:11:09,710
- [sobbing] 
HE WAS SO AMAZING.

296
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:11,420
- THAT WAS ACTUALLY

297
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:13,422
AN EXAMPLE OF HOW NOT 
SO AMAZING HE WAS.

298
00:11:13,422 --> 00:11:15,507
YOU'RE REALLY GOING 
THROUGH SOMETHING HERE, HUH?

299
00:11:15,507 --> 00:11:17,426
- I KNOW!

300
00:11:17,426 --> 00:11:18,719
YOU KNOW, IT'S FUNNY--

301
00:11:18,719 --> 00:11:20,554
ALL THOSE YEARS 
WHEN I PRETENDED TO CRY,

302
00:11:20,554 --> 00:11:23,057
I USED TO USE DAD'S DEATH 
TO GET ME GOING.

303
00:11:23,057 --> 00:11:24,725
I TRIED IT WITH MOM'S,

304
00:11:24,725 --> 00:11:27,102
BUT I'D JUST END UP SMILING 
AND RUINING IT.

305
00:11:27,102 --> 00:11:28,854
BUT IT FEELS, LIKE, REAL. 
YOU KNOW?

306
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:30,480
AND YOU HAVEN'T REALLY

307
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,524
ALLOWED YOURSELF TO GRIEVE 
MUCH AT ALL, MICHAEL.

308
00:11:32,524 --> 00:11:34,401
- MY RELATIONSHIP WITH DAD 
WAS MUCH MORE--

309
00:11:34,401 --> 00:11:36,528
MUCH MORE 
COMPLICATED THAN YOURS.

310
00:11:36,528 --> 00:11:38,823
IT WAS PREDICATED A LOT 
ON SECRETS AND LIES.

311
00:11:38,823 --> 00:11:41,700
THERE WASN'T 
A LOT OF TRUST THERE.

312
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:43,535
- HERE HE COMES.

313
00:11:43,535 --> 00:11:45,495
HERE COMES 
JOHN WAYNE.

314
00:11:46,872 --> 00:11:50,250
I'M NOT GONNA CRY 
ABOUT MY PA.

315
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:52,920
I'M GONNA BUILD AN AIRPORT, 
PUT MY NAME ON IT.

316
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,504
WHY, MICHAEL?

317
00:11:54,504 --> 00:11:57,299
SO YOU CAN FLY AWAY 
FROM YOUR FEELINGS?

318
00:11:57,299 --> 00:12:01,095
YOU CAN KEEP 'EM BOTTLED UP, 
BUT THEY WILL COME OUT, MICHAEL.

319
00:12:01,095 --> 00:12:04,598
SOMETIMES 
IN THE MOST UNEXPECTED--

320
00:12:04,598 --> 00:12:07,977
HEY, WHERE THE [bleep] 
ARE MY HARD-BOILED EGGS?

321
00:12:16,401 --> 00:12:18,112
[narrator] 
MEANWHILE, GOB

322
00:12:18,112 --> 00:12:21,531
WAS PREPARING FOR THE ILLUSION 
OF BEING BURIED ALIVE.

323
00:12:21,531 --> 00:12:23,533
- BOY, YOU SURE GOT 
THIS HOLE DUG OUT QUICK.

324
00:12:23,533 --> 00:12:25,452
[narrator] 
IN FACT, THE LABORER

325
00:12:25,452 --> 00:12:27,454
HAD BEEN HIRED BY GEORGE SR. 
THREE DAYS EARLIER...

326
00:12:27,454 --> 00:12:29,498
FOR THE SAME HOLE.

327
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:33,878
AND BUSTER SEARCHED 
FOR THE PERFECT CARD.

328
00:12:33,878 --> 00:12:35,921
- "SOMEONE WANTED TO SEND YOU 
A BIRTHDAY GREETING.

329
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:37,798
SEE YOU SOON!"

330
00:12:37,798 --> 00:12:40,885
OH! 
THAT IS WICKED.

331
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:43,262
[chuckles]

332
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:44,763
[narrator] 
AND SOON, THE WAKE

333
00:12:44,763 --> 00:12:46,515
THAT ICE HAD CATERED BEGAN.

334
00:12:46,515 --> 00:12:48,642
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING? 
IS THIS WHAT YOU'RE WEARING?

335
00:12:48,642 --> 00:12:50,644
- MY FATHER'S DEAD, MAEBY.

336
00:12:50,644 --> 00:12:53,397
- YEAH, BUT YOU'RE NOT, 
AND ICE IS RIGHT THERE.

337
00:12:53,397 --> 00:12:54,982
[narrator] 
MAEBY KNEW THAT

338
00:12:54,982 --> 00:12:56,817
IF SHE COULD GET HER MOTHER 
TO HAVE AN AFFAIR,

339
00:12:56,817 --> 00:12:58,652
SHE COULD EMANCIPATE.

340
00:12:58,652 --> 00:13:00,362
- ALL POP-POP EVER WANTED

341
00:13:00,362 --> 00:13:02,781
WAS TO SEE YOU WITH 
ANOTHER MAN BESIDES DADDY.

342
00:13:02,781 --> 00:13:04,533
- YOU'RE RIGHT.

343
00:13:04,533 --> 00:13:06,451
YOU KNOW WHAT?

344
00:13:06,451 --> 00:13:08,120
I'M GONNA THROW ON A SKIRT,

345
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,372
TAKE OFF MY UNDERWEAR 
AND MAKE YOUR POP-POP PROUD.

346
00:13:10,372 --> 00:13:11,706
- WAIT A MINUTE. 
LET ME ASK BARRY.

347
00:13:11,706 --> 00:13:13,167
THAT MIGHT BE ENOUGH 
RIGHT THERE.

348
00:13:15,669 --> 00:13:17,712
- IS OSCAR 
WEARING MY SUIT?

349
00:13:17,712 --> 00:13:19,256
HEY--

350
00:13:19,256 --> 00:13:20,757
YOU TELL MY BROTHER

351
00:13:20,757 --> 00:13:22,551
YOU DON'T WEAR 
A DEAD MAN'S PANTS.

352
00:13:22,551 --> 00:13:24,011
SHAME ON HIM.

353
00:13:24,011 --> 00:13:25,888
AND YOU SAY THAT TO HIM. 
YOU SAY, "SHAME ON YOU."

354
00:13:25,888 --> 00:13:27,556
- OKAY.

355
00:13:27,556 --> 00:13:29,349
- SAY IT TO ME LIKE 
YOU'RE GONNA SAY IT TO HIM.

356
00:13:29,349 --> 00:13:31,810
- I'M PROBABLY NOT 
GONNA SAY IT TO HIM.

357
00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:33,812
- OKAY.

358
00:13:33,812 --> 00:13:36,356
LOOK AT HER DOWN THERE. 
DOES SHE LOOK SAD TO YOU?

359
00:13:36,356 --> 00:13:37,482
- OH, MY GOD. 
THAT'S ANN.

360
00:13:37,482 --> 00:13:39,068
- WHO?

361
00:13:39,068 --> 00:13:40,986
- IT'S THE GIRL 
WHO RIPPED MY HEART OUT,

362
00:13:40,986 --> 00:13:42,321
THE GIRL WHOSE FACE

363
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:44,531
WILL ALWAYS BE 
ETCHED IN MY MIND.

364
00:13:44,531 --> 00:13:46,491
- HER?

365
00:13:48,202 --> 00:13:50,204
- SHE'S REALLY FUNNY.

366
00:13:50,204 --> 00:13:52,915
- WELL, LET'S HOPE SO.

367
00:13:52,915 --> 00:13:54,624
DON'T FORGET 
THE CHICKEN WINGS!

368
00:13:54,624 --> 00:13:57,669
- HEY! ANN! 
YOU'RE HERE. THAT'S GREAT.

369
00:13:57,669 --> 00:13:59,463
I WASN'T SURE 
WHETHER YOU GOT MY MESSAGE.

370
00:13:59,463 --> 00:14:00,881
- IT WASN'T A MESSAGE.

371
00:14:00,881 --> 00:14:03,842
WE TALKED. 
- UH, ANN?

372
00:14:04,801 --> 00:14:06,428
DID DAD INVITE YOU?

373
00:14:06,428 --> 00:14:08,472
- I FIGURED LIFE'S TOO SHORT.

374
00:14:08,472 --> 00:14:09,848
YOU TWO SEEM TO 
CARE FOR EACH OTHER.

375
00:14:09,848 --> 00:14:11,558
WHY THROW THAT AWAY? 
HUH?

376
00:14:11,558 --> 00:14:14,061
HUH? 
OKAY.

377
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:19,316
- DO YOU THINK WE REALLY DO? 
- A FATHER CAN TELL. OKAY?

378
00:14:19,316 --> 00:14:22,444
IT'S AS ANN AS THE NOSE 
ON PLAIN'S FACE.

379
00:14:22,444 --> 00:14:24,488
[narrator] 
AND BUSTER ARRIVED...

380
00:14:24,488 --> 00:14:27,116
DRESSED IN THE MILITARY OUTFIT 
GOB HAD PROCURED FOR HIM.

381
00:14:27,116 --> 00:14:28,533
- WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU WEARING?

382
00:14:28,533 --> 00:14:29,869
- IT'S ALL REGULATION, 
MICHAEL.

383
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:31,286
TO GET THE TOP RIGHT,

384
00:14:31,286 --> 00:14:33,538
THE PANTS HAD TO BE 
A LITTLE SNUG.

385
00:14:33,538 --> 00:14:34,915
IS THERE 
A BIRTHDAY GIFT PILE?

386
00:14:34,915 --> 00:14:36,541
HMM?

387
00:14:36,541 --> 00:14:38,585
- A BIRTHDAY GIFT PILE?

388
00:14:38,585 --> 00:14:40,337
[narrator] 
MICHAEL RECALLED

389
00:14:40,337 --> 00:14:42,797
WHAT BUSTER DID TO WHAT 
HE THOUGHT WAS ROSA'S CAR...

390
00:14:42,797 --> 00:14:45,800
WITH WHAT HE THOUGHT 
WAS ROSA'S FAVORITE TOY.

391
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:47,844
- [driver] 
HEY!

392
00:14:47,844 --> 00:14:49,429
- YOURS IS THE FIRST.

393
00:14:49,429 --> 00:14:51,932
- AND THE MOST WICKED. 
[giggles]

394
00:14:51,932 --> 00:14:53,475
- GET HIM OUT OF HERE.

395
00:14:53,475 --> 00:14:55,477
WE CAN'T LET HIM KNOW 
IT'S A WAKE.

396
00:14:55,477 --> 00:14:57,479
- BUSTER!

397
00:14:57,479 --> 00:14:59,273
LET'S GO GET THAT COFFIN 
READY TO BE BURIED.

398
00:14:59,273 --> 00:15:02,026
[both laughing]

399
00:15:02,026 --> 00:15:03,652
[narrator] 
AND SO THE FAMILY GATHERED

400
00:15:03,652 --> 00:15:05,570
TO REMEMBER GEORGE SR.

401
00:15:05,570 --> 00:15:08,908
- IF ANYONE WOULD LIKE 
TO SAY ANYTHING ABOUT DAD,

402
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:10,867
NOW'S THE TIME.

403
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:16,498
ANYONE. 
- ANYONE?

404
00:15:16,498 --> 00:15:20,627
- PERHAPS MY SON GEORGE MICHAEL 
WOULD LIKE TO SAY SOMETHING.

405
00:15:20,627 --> 00:15:23,338
HUH? WANNA SHARE 
YOUR FEELINGS? EH?

406
00:15:23,338 --> 00:15:24,756
IT'S OKAY TO CRY, PAL. 
IT'S OKAY.

407
00:15:24,756 --> 00:15:26,883
- YEAH?

408
00:15:26,883 --> 00:15:29,803
WOW. 
HE'S REALLY GONE.

409
00:15:31,513 --> 00:15:36,018
BUT I THINK THAT IF HE 
WAS HERE RIGHT NOW,

410
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:40,064
I WOULD PROBABLY TELL HIM 
THAT IT ALL WORKED OUT...

411
00:15:40,064 --> 00:15:43,067
AND THAT, UM,

412
00:15:43,067 --> 00:15:46,611
I'LL BE BRINGING YOU 
SOME SALMON ROLLS RIGHT AWAY...

413
00:15:46,611 --> 00:15:49,406
IN... HEAVEN.

414
00:15:49,406 --> 00:15:50,782
- HOW MANY TIMES

415
00:15:50,782 --> 00:15:52,784
I GOTTA TELL THIS KID 
CHICKEN WINGS?

416
00:15:52,784 --> 00:15:54,411
[narrator] 
LINDSAY GOT UP TO SPEAK

417
00:15:54,411 --> 00:15:55,955
IN AN OUTFIT 
HER DAUGHTER HAD CHOSEN.

418
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:58,332
- MY FATHER 
MEANT THE WORLD TO ME.

419
00:15:58,332 --> 00:15:59,541
[sniffles]

420
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:01,543
- WIPE, MOM. 
GIVE IT A WIPE.

421
00:16:01,543 --> 00:16:03,420
- THAT'S A HOME RUN.

422
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:04,671
[narrator] 
AND FINALLY,

423
00:16:04,671 --> 00:16:06,465
MICHAEL GOT UP TO SPEAK.

424
00:16:06,465 --> 00:16:09,509
- I HAD A VERY COMPLICATED 
RELATIONSHIP WITH MY FATHER.

425
00:16:09,509 --> 00:16:10,885
[blender whirring]

426
00:16:10,885 --> 00:16:12,512
ICE, CAN WE--

427
00:16:12,512 --> 00:16:15,099
CAN WE JUST COOL IT 
ON THE SMOOTHIES FOR RIGHT NOW?

428
00:16:15,099 --> 00:16:17,476
- THERE ARE SMOOTHIES?

429
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:19,436
- I COULD NEVER 
TRUST MY FATHER.

430
00:16:19,436 --> 00:16:22,731
BUT I ALWAYS WANT MY SON 
TO BE ABLE TO TRUST ME,

431
00:16:22,731 --> 00:16:25,359
SO FROM NOW ON,

432
00:16:25,359 --> 00:16:28,028
WE'RE ALWAYS GONNA BE 
HONEST WITH EACH OTHER.

433
00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:30,780
OKAY?

434
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:33,283
'CAUSE THERE'S NOBODY I LOVE

435
00:16:33,283 --> 00:16:35,785
MORE THAN YOU 
IN THIS WHOLE WORLD.

436
00:16:38,747 --> 00:16:41,291
- MICHAEL, LISTEN, CAN WE 
MOVE THE EULOGY OUTSIDE,

437
00:16:41,291 --> 00:16:43,002
SO I CAN TIME BEING

438
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:45,170
LOWERED INTO DAD'S GRAVE 
WITH YOUR BIG FINISH?

439
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:46,421
- I'M DONE.

440
00:16:46,421 --> 00:16:48,215
- WOW. 
THAT WAS YOUR EULOGY?

441
00:16:48,215 --> 00:16:50,634
GLAD DAD WASN'T AROUND 
TO SEE THAT.

442
00:16:52,052 --> 00:16:54,554
- THAT WAS GREAT. 
- WELL, I MEANT IT.

443
00:16:54,554 --> 00:16:57,974
SO NO MORE SECRET TRIPS 
UP TO THE ATTIC. RIGHT?

444
00:16:57,974 --> 00:16:59,601
[narrator] 
GEORGE MICHAEL DIDN'T WANT

445
00:16:59,601 --> 00:17:01,186
TO BETRAY HIS GRANDFATHER,

446
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:03,230
BUT IT APPEARED HIS FATHER 
ALREADY KNEW THE TRUTH.

447
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:04,564
- I HAVE POP-POP 
IN THE ATTIC.

448
00:17:04,564 --> 00:17:06,733
- WHAT?

449
00:17:06,733 --> 00:17:08,735
THE MERE FACT THAT YOU CALL 
MAKING LOVE "POP-POP"

450
00:17:08,735 --> 00:17:09,986
TELLS ME YOU'RE NOT READY.

451
00:17:09,986 --> 00:17:12,447
- HEY! 
BEFORE WE LOSE THE SUN!

452
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:14,408
- COME ON.

453
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:20,372
- THE SPEECHES WE HEARD TODAY 
ARE NOTHING MORE THAN WORDS.

454
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:23,458
BUT I WILL PROVE THAT I LOVE 
MY FATHER MORE THAN ANYBODY.

455
00:17:23,458 --> 00:17:27,046
[Europe's 
The Final Countdown playing]

456
00:17:29,423 --> 00:17:31,716
[whispers] 
BUSTER!

457
00:17:33,468 --> 00:17:35,429
[music continues]

458
00:17:38,098 --> 00:17:41,226
[whispers] 
STOP IT!

459
00:17:45,021 --> 00:17:48,858
AS YOU CAN SEE, 
THIS IS A NORMAL COFFIN.

460
00:17:51,111 --> 00:17:53,113
TAKE ME HALFWAY AROUND.

461
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:57,659
- [grunting]

462
00:17:59,286 --> 00:18:01,788
I WILL BECOME 
MY DEAD FATHER'S BODY...

463
00:18:01,788 --> 00:18:04,624
AS I AM LOWERED 
INTO HIS GRAVE.

464
00:18:04,624 --> 00:18:05,917
ALL RIGHT. 
SPIN IT BACK AROUND.

465
00:18:05,917 --> 00:18:07,252
- DEAD FATHER?

466
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:09,129
IS HE DE-- 
DAD'S DEAD?

467
00:18:09,129 --> 00:18:12,174
- JUST KEEP IT TOGETHER, BUSTER, 
AND SPIN THIS BACK AROUND.

468
00:18:12,174 --> 00:18:14,801
- OH, MY GOD! 
THE CARD! THE CARD!

469
00:18:14,801 --> 00:18:17,846
[spectators gasping]

470
00:18:17,846 --> 00:18:20,099
- [Gob] 
SOMETHING'S GONE WRONG.

471
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:23,352
[murmuring, chattering]

472
00:18:23,352 --> 00:18:24,603
- HOW ABOUT THAT?

473
00:18:27,397 --> 00:18:29,065
[narrator] 
MICHAEL NOTICED SOMETHING

474
00:18:29,065 --> 00:18:30,109
IN THE DIRT.

475
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:32,194
- [sighs] 
GLISTEN.

476
00:18:32,194 --> 00:18:34,696
AND SUDDENLY HE REALIZED 
WHAT HIS SON MEANT WHEN HE SAID

477
00:18:34,696 --> 00:18:37,199
HE HAD POP-POP IN THE ATTIC.

478
00:18:37,199 --> 00:18:39,493
- DAD? 
DAD.

479
00:18:42,204 --> 00:18:45,165
- HOW YOU DOIN', MICHAEL?

480
00:18:45,165 --> 00:18:47,000
UH, HEY, BUT YOUR FATHER'S 
ALIVE, MICHAEL.

481
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,503
HE'S ALIVE.

482
00:18:49,503 --> 00:18:52,631
- HOW COULD YOU DO THIS TO US? 
- I HAD NO CHOICE.

483
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:55,592
MY BROTHER IS WITH LUCILLE. 
SHE'S DESTROYING THE FAMILY.

484
00:18:55,592 --> 00:18:58,094
- YOU PUT THE ENTIRE BUSINESS IN 
PERIL, YOU ESCAPE FROM PRISON,

485
00:18:58,094 --> 00:18:59,971
THEN MAKE US THINK YOU'VE DIED?

486
00:18:59,971 --> 00:19:03,350
- I-I-I'M AN INNOCENT MAN, 
MICHAEL. I'M A PATSY.

487
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:04,726
I-I SIGNED SOME DOCUMENTS--

488
00:19:04,726 --> 00:19:06,645
I THOUGHT THEY WERE 
GONNA KILL ME.

489
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:09,689
DON'T TURN ME IN. OKAY? 
CAN YOU HELP ME OUT?

490
00:19:09,689 --> 00:19:11,024
[narrator] 
AND FOR A MOMENT

491
00:19:11,024 --> 00:19:12,317
MICHAEL WAS CONFLICTED.

492
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:13,902
- WELL, I'M NOT GONNA LET YOU

493
00:19:13,902 --> 00:19:15,737
STAY HERE AND MAKE MY SON 
AN ACCOMPLICE. OKAY?

494
00:19:15,737 --> 00:19:17,447
I'M SORRY.

495
00:19:17,447 --> 00:19:19,408
I'M NOT GONNA LET YOU 
SPREAD YOUR GUILT TO HIM.

496
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:22,911
- ICE, MY MOTHER 
HAS SOMETHING TO TELL YOU.

497
00:19:22,911 --> 00:19:24,329
- I FIND YOU VERY ATTRACTIVE.

498
00:19:24,329 --> 00:19:26,540
- SHE CLEANS UP NICE TOO. 
TRUST ME.

499
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:29,459
- UH, I THINK I'M FINALLY 
OFF THE CLOCK.

500
00:19:30,794 --> 00:19:32,754
- I'M OUT OF HERE, 
RIGHT?

501
00:19:32,754 --> 00:19:35,465
- HI. DAD'S ALIVE. 
HE'S HIDING IN THE ATTIC.

502
00:19:35,465 --> 00:19:36,591
- HE'S UPSTAIRS?

503
00:19:36,591 --> 00:19:38,635
