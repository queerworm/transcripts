00:00:01,567 --> 00:00:03,236
narrator: NOW THE STORY OF A 
WEALTHY FAMILY

2
00:00:03,236 --> 00:00:04,370
WHO LOST EVERYTHING...

3
00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:06,472
AND THE ONE SON 
WHO HAD NO CHOICE...

4
00:00:06,472 --> 00:00:08,508
BUT TO KEEP THEM ALL TOGETHER.

5
00:00:13,946 --> 00:00:15,715
IT'S ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT.

6
00:00:18,818 --> 00:00:20,120
MICHAEL BLUTH WAS FED UP

7
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:23,223
WITH HIS MOTHER'S 
EXTRAVAGANT SPENDING.

8
00:00:23,223 --> 00:00:26,025
- HEY, MOM. REMEMBER WE HAD THAT 
CONVERSATION ABOUT TRYING TO...

9
00:00:26,025 --> 00:00:28,028
CUT BACK ON THINGS 
THAT AREN'T NECESSITIES?

10
00:00:28,028 --> 00:00:30,930
- LIKE IT WAS YESTERDAY. 
- IT WAS THIS MORNING,

11
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:33,699
AND NOW I HEAR THAT YOU'VE HIRED 
A CREW FOR THE YACHT.

12
00:00:33,699 --> 00:00:34,734
I'M SELLING THAT YACHT.

13
00:00:34,734 --> 00:00:37,170
- MICHAEL, YOU HAVEN'T HEARD 
WHY I WANT IT.

14
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:38,338
TO THROW THE MOST LAVISH PARTY

15
00:00:38,338 --> 00:00:41,641
THIS TOWN HAS EVER SEEN 
FOR MY BIRTHDAY.

16
00:00:41,641 --> 00:00:43,643
- I ENJOY BICENTENNIALS 
AS MUCH AS THE NEXT GUY, MOM,

17
00:00:43,643 --> 00:00:44,977
BUT WE'RE NOT DOING THAT.

18
00:00:44,977 --> 00:00:46,079
- MY NEIGHBOR LUCILLE AUSTERO

19
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:49,382
IS CONSTANTLY THROWING PARTIES 
FOR HERSELF.

20
00:00:49,382 --> 00:00:50,783
SHE'S HAVING ANOTHER ONE 
IN A WEEK.

21
00:00:50,783 --> 00:00:52,785
- I'M NOT GOING TO THAT.

22
00:00:52,785 --> 00:00:54,754
narrator: BUSTER HAD BEEN 
AVOIDING LUCILLE AUSTERO

23
00:00:54,754 --> 00:00:56,289
SINCE HE ACCIDENTALLY FLIRTED 
WITH HER

24
00:00:56,289 --> 00:00:59,492
WHILE NOT WEARING HIS GLASSES.

25
00:00:59,492 --> 00:01:00,793
AND THEN ACCIDENTALLY BID 
ON HER

26
00:01:00,793 --> 00:01:02,528
AT A CHARITY 
BACHELORETTE AUCTION.

27
00:01:02,528 --> 00:01:05,698
- TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS! 
- BUSTER.

28
00:01:05,698 --> 00:01:07,533
narrator: AND THEN ACCIDENTALLY 
ENTERED HER APARTMENT,

29
00:01:07,533 --> 00:01:09,335
THINKING IT WAS HIS MOTHER'S.

30
00:01:09,335 --> 00:01:11,604
- I NEED YOU RIGHT NOW. 
[gasps]

31
00:01:11,604 --> 00:01:14,907
- FELLAS, TAKE A POWDER.

32
00:01:14,907 --> 00:01:17,877
- OH, HERE COMES THE 10:15 
CONNIPTION, RIGHT ON TIME.

33
00:01:17,877 --> 00:01:19,912
HONEST TO GOD, BUSTER, 
IT'S LIKE EVERY LITTLE THING

34
00:01:19,912 --> 00:01:21,447
MAKES YOU SEIZE UP IN TERROR 
LATELY.

35
00:01:21,447 --> 00:01:24,250
I HAVE NO IDEA 
WHERE YOU GET THAT FROM.

36
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:25,485
GET AWAY FROM THAT STOVE.

37
00:01:25,485 --> 00:01:27,453
YOU'RE GOING TO 
LIGHT YOUR HAIR ON FIRE.

38
00:01:28,921 --> 00:01:31,457
HE'S WEAK.

39
00:01:31,457 --> 00:01:34,527
- SPEAKING OF WEAK, MOM, WHAT DO 
YOU GOT IN THERE, GOLD BARS?

40
00:01:36,296 --> 00:01:39,932
- PROTEIN BARS FOR YOUR FATHER. 
HE'S PUMPING UP IN PRISON.

41
00:01:39,932 --> 00:01:41,867
- NO MORE PARTIES. 
OKAY, MOM?

42
00:01:41,867 --> 00:01:45,338
- YOU'RE MY THIRD 
LEAST-FAVORITE CHILD.

43
00:01:45,338 --> 00:01:46,906
- I CAN LIVE WITH THAT.

44
00:01:46,906 --> 00:01:48,841
narrator: MICHAEL CAME HOME 
TO FIND HIS MOTHER'S

45
00:01:48,841 --> 00:01:50,943
FOURTH LEAST-FAVORITE CHILD.

46
00:01:50,943 --> 00:01:52,245
- HEARD YOU'RE SELLING THE 
YACHT.

47
00:01:52,245 --> 00:01:54,247
- YEAH. I HAD A COUPLE 
IN THERE THIS MORNING.

48
00:01:54,247 --> 00:01:55,681
- YEAH, I KNOW.

49
00:01:59,852 --> 00:02:02,388
- WELL, THEY GOT 
THE ASIAN RIGHT.

50
00:02:02,388 --> 00:02:06,826
"HOTTIES" MIGHT BE 
A STRETCH.

51
00:02:06,826 --> 00:02:10,463
WELL, LET'S START 
WITH THE LITTLE ONE.

52
00:02:10,463 --> 00:02:12,132
- YOU'RE NOT STAYING ON 
THE YACHT, ARE YOU?

53
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:14,200
- WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO, 
MICHAEL?

54
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:17,203
LIVE FULL-TIME WITH MARTA? 
- OR BREAK UP WITH HER.

55
00:02:17,203 --> 00:02:18,771
I'M SURE THERE'D BE 
SOMEBODY ELSE OUT THERE

56
00:02:18,771 --> 00:02:19,939
THAT WOULD APPRECIATE HER.

57
00:02:19,939 --> 00:02:23,209
narrator: IN FACT, MICHAEL FELT 
THAT MAN WAS HIMSELF.

58
00:02:23,209 --> 00:02:26,179
HE HAD BECOME INFATUATED 
WITH HIS BROTHER'S GIRLFRIEND.

59
00:02:26,179 --> 00:02:29,081
AND WAS HAVING DIFFICULTY 
KEEPING HIS LOVE A SECRET.

60
00:02:29,081 --> 00:02:31,717
YOU HAVE 48 HOURS 
TO VACATE THE YACHT.

61
00:02:31,717 --> 00:02:36,289
- GUYS, I'VE GOT A GREAT IDEA. 
I WANNA THROW MOM A PARTY.

62
00:02:36,289 --> 00:02:39,259
- WOULD YOU--I JUST TOLD MOM 
NO MORE PARTIES.

63
00:02:39,259 --> 00:02:40,260
- I KNOW, MICHAEL.

64
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:41,927
THAT'S WHY THIS IS THE PERFECT 
OPPORTUNITY

65
00:02:41,927 --> 00:02:43,563
TO THROW HER A SURPRISE PARTY.

66
00:02:43,563 --> 00:02:45,998
SHE'D NEVER SUSPECT IT. 
- IS THIS HER SUGGESTION?

67
00:02:45,998 --> 00:02:50,002
- NO. I JUST THINK IT'S 
IMPORTANT TO HONOR YOUR PARENTS.

68
00:02:50,002 --> 00:02:51,704
- WHY DON'T YOU START 
BY VISITING DAD IN JAIL?

69
00:02:51,704 --> 00:02:53,906
YOU'VE NEVER EVEN BEEN THERE.

70
00:02:53,906 --> 00:02:55,741
- MICHAEL, DO YOU HAVE 
ANY IDEA WHAT WOULD HAPPEN

71
00:02:55,741 --> 00:02:57,643
IF I WERE TO VISIT PRISON?

72
00:02:57,643 --> 00:02:59,945
- HMM. 
- IT WOULD BE PANDEMONIUM.

73
00:02:59,945 --> 00:03:00,946
- MM-HMM.

74
00:03:00,946 --> 00:03:03,283
- IT'D JUST GIVE DAD 
ONE MORE REASON TO THINK...

75
00:03:03,283 --> 00:03:04,817
THAT I'VE GOT NOTHING 
TO OFFER BUT MY LOOKS.

76
00:03:04,817 --> 00:03:06,151
- YEAH, I GOT SOME OF THAT...

77
00:03:06,151 --> 00:03:08,488
EXCEPT HE ALSO DIDN'T LIKE 
MY LOOKS.

78
00:03:09,755 --> 00:03:12,592
- OKAY, MICHAEL. 
I WILL GO VISIT DAD,

79
00:03:12,592 --> 00:03:13,893
IF YOU DRIVE MOM TO THE 
RESTAURANT

80
00:03:13,893 --> 00:03:14,694
FOR THE SURPRISE PARTY.

81
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:17,597
- I'LL JUST PRETEND THAT 
I'M TAKING HER OUT THAT EVENING.

82
00:03:17,597 --> 00:03:18,931
COME ON. 
THAT WOULD NEVER HAPPEN.

83
00:03:18,931 --> 00:03:20,900
- WELL, SHE CERTAINLY CAN'T 
DRIVE HERSELF.

84
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:23,436
I MEAN, SHE'S 
THE WORLD'S WORST DRIVER.

85
00:03:23,436 --> 00:03:24,970
narrator: LINDSAY WAS NOT 
EXAGGERATING.

86
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:28,173
LUCILLE HAD RECENTLY 
BEEN FEATURED ON FOX'S

87
00:03:28,173 --> 00:03:30,009
WORLD'S WORST DRIVERS.

88
00:03:31,544 --> 00:03:32,545
- YEAH.

89
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:34,847
I CAN'T BELIEVE SHE GOT THAT 
DRIVER'S LICENSE RENEWED.

90
00:03:34,847 --> 00:03:36,682
- SHE DIDN'T. 
I DUMMIED HER UP A NEW ONE.

91
00:03:36,682 --> 00:03:38,884
NOT MY BEST WORK THOUGH. 
SHE WANTED TO LOOK 48.

92
00:03:38,884 --> 00:03:40,620
I NEARLY AIRBRUSHED HER 
INTO OBLIVION.

93
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:43,088
WE ENDED UP CHECKING 
"ALBINO" ON THE FORM.

94
00:03:43,088 --> 00:03:44,089
- COME ON, MICHAEL.

95
00:03:44,089 --> 00:03:46,859
WHO KNOWS HOW LONG OUR PARENTS 
ARE GOING TO BE AROUND.

96
00:03:46,859 --> 00:03:47,860
- YEAH, WELL I GOTTA TELL YA.

97
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:48,961
I WAS OVER AT HER PLACE TODAY,

98
00:03:48,961 --> 00:03:50,296
AND SHE LOOKED 
A LITTLE FRAIL TO ME.

99
00:03:50,296 --> 00:03:51,297
SHE WAS HAVING TROUBLE

100
00:03:51,297 --> 00:03:53,766
EVEN LIFTING UP THIS BAG OF 
GROCERIES.

101
00:03:53,766 --> 00:03:57,136
ALL RIGHT. 
WE WILL DO THE SURPRISE PARTY.

102
00:03:57,136 --> 00:03:59,872
- FOR GANGY?

103
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:03,943
- YEAH, HOW DID YOU KNOW? 
- SHE CALLED AND INVITED US.

104
00:04:03,943 --> 00:04:08,080
- OKAY, SO IT WAS HER IDEA. 
- WE DON'T HAVE TO GO, DO WE?

105
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,081
- COME ON.

106
00:04:09,081 --> 00:04:10,516
THIS IS 
A BLUTH FAMILY CELEBRATION.

107
00:04:10,516 --> 00:04:12,285
IT'S NO PLACE FOR CHILDREN.

108
00:04:12,285 --> 00:04:14,219
narrator: AND LINDSAY WENT TO 
THE PRISON TO VISIT

109
00:04:14,219 --> 00:04:17,323
HER FATHER FOR THE FIRST TIME.

110
00:04:17,323 --> 00:04:21,026
BUT DIDN'T GET THE RECEPTION 
SHE WAS EXPECTING.

111
00:04:21,026 --> 00:04:22,695
- I WANNA THANK YOU FOR COMING 
HERE.

112
00:04:22,695 --> 00:04:23,863
IT TOOK A LOT OF GUTS.

113
00:04:23,863 --> 00:04:24,997
- THE REASON I'M HERE TODAY

114
00:04:24,997 --> 00:04:28,100
IS BECAUSE I FELT THAT 
I NEEDED TO SAY SOMETHING.

115
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:30,603
- OH, OKAY. 
- MY WHOLE LIFE,

116
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:34,274
ALL YOU'VE EVER PRAISED ME FOR 
IS MY LOOKS.

117
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:36,876
- OH, NO. YOUR LOOKS-- 
- YES, DAD.

118
00:04:36,876 --> 00:04:39,612
I MEAN, IT'S ALWAYS BEEN 
MICHAEL'S GOT THE BRAINS,

119
00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:43,349
GOB'S GOT THE CHARM, 
BUSTER'S GOT THE--

120
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:47,320
- HIGH-FASTENING PANTS. 
- HAVE YOU SAID THAT?

121
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,788
- NO. I'M SAYING THAT NOW.

122
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:49,789
- SO, ANYWAY.

123
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:52,024
LOOK, IF YOU'RE WONDERING WHY 
I HAVEN'T VISITED,

124
00:04:52,024 --> 00:04:53,726
MAYBE IT'S BECAUSE I WANTED TO 
BE THOUGHT OF

125
00:04:53,726 --> 00:04:55,495
AS MORE THAN 
JUST A BEAUTIFUL FACE.

126
00:04:55,495 --> 00:04:58,464
AND A GORGEOUS HEAD OF HAIR.

127
00:05:00,733 --> 00:05:02,502
narrator: LINDSAY WAS 
SURPRISED ONCE AGAIN

128
00:05:02,502 --> 00:05:04,804
THAT NO HEADS WERE TURNED.

129
00:05:04,804 --> 00:05:06,672
- [scoffs]

130
00:05:06,672 --> 00:05:10,743
I'M GONNA GO SHOPPING. 
I'LL BE BACK TOMORROW.

131
00:05:12,612 --> 00:05:14,414
narrator: GEORGE MICHAEL 
WAS FINALLY MOVING

132
00:05:14,414 --> 00:05:16,349
BEYOND 
HIS CRUSH ON MAEBY...

133
00:05:16,349 --> 00:05:18,818
AND FELT HAPPY TO HAVE A COUSIN 
HE COULD JUST SEE A MOVIE WITH.

134
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:20,353
- IT WAS A LOVE 
BETWEEN TWO COUSINS

135
00:05:20,353 --> 00:05:24,089
THAT THE WORLD THOUGHT WAS 
WRONG.

136
00:05:24,089 --> 00:05:25,525
BUT IT WAS THE WORLD 
THAT WAS WRONG.

137
00:05:25,525 --> 00:05:27,126
- [speaking French]

138
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:30,496
- WE HAVE GOT TO 
SEE THIS MOVIE.

139
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:31,831
- EXCUSE ME, KIDS?

140
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:33,966
CAN I SEE YOUR I.D.'S?

141
00:05:38,137 --> 00:05:39,672
narrator: 
AND MICHAEL WAS DRIVING HIS

142
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:41,340
MOTHER TO HER SURPRISE PARTY.

143
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:44,910
- WHERE ON EARTH 
ARE WE GOING?

144
00:05:44,910 --> 00:05:48,013
LEFT AT THE NEXT CORNER.

145
00:05:48,013 --> 00:05:50,049
YOU KNOW, MICHAEL? 
- YEAH?

146
00:05:50,049 --> 00:05:52,452
- I'D BE HAPPY TO DRIVE 
IF YOU WANT ME TO.

147
00:05:52,452 --> 00:05:53,619
IT'S BETTER THAN SITTING HERE

148
00:05:53,619 --> 00:05:55,821
WITH BUSTER'S STUPID ROCK 
BEHIND ME.

149
00:05:55,821 --> 00:05:57,890
narrator: BUSTER HAD RECENTLY 
BROUGHT THE ROCK HOME...

150
00:05:57,890 --> 00:05:58,958
FROM AN ARCHEOLOGICAL DIG,

151
00:05:58,958 --> 00:06:02,127
BUT HAD YET TO FIND A WAY 
TO GET IT OUT OF THE CAR.

152
00:06:02,127 --> 00:06:04,930
- MOM, YOU'VE ALREADY GOT 
TWO STRIKES ON YOUR RECORD.

153
00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:08,333
YOU STRIKE ONE MORE PERSON, 
AND IT'S TECHNICALLY A SPREE.

154
00:06:10,369 --> 00:06:15,107
- ARE WE GOING TO THE BACK? 
IS THIS WHAT I THINK IT IS?

155
00:06:15,107 --> 00:06:16,108
- SURPRISE!

156
00:06:16,108 --> 00:06:19,612
narrator: 
AND SHE WAS SURPRISED...

157
00:06:19,612 --> 00:06:20,813
THAT HER FAMILY DIDN'T SHOW UP.

158
00:06:20,813 --> 00:06:24,784
- SO THIS IS WHAT 
MY CHILDREN THINK OF ME.

159
00:06:24,784 --> 00:06:27,487
- [singing] MORE FICTION THAN 
IT'S FACT

160
00:06:27,487 --> 00:06:30,222
BUT BELIEVE IT OR NOT 
MY MOTHER DEAR

161
00:06:30,222 --> 00:06:32,892
DECIDED SHE'D COME BACK

162
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:35,561
AS A CAR-- 
[tv clicks off]

163
00:06:37,663 --> 00:06:40,365
- WHERE THE-- [beep] 
WAS EVERYBODY?

164
00:06:40,365 --> 00:06:41,601
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

165
00:06:41,601 --> 00:06:43,168
- MOM'S PARTY. 
WHERE WERE YOU GUYS?

166
00:06:44,236 --> 00:06:46,205
- IT'S THE FIRST 
I'VE HEARD ABOUT IT.

167
00:06:47,239 --> 00:06:51,644
- WHAT ABOUT YOU? NEIMAN'S? 
- PRISON.

168
00:06:51,644 --> 00:06:52,645
THEN NEIMAN'S.

169
00:06:52,645 --> 00:06:54,246
BUT ONLY BECAUSE I'M GOING BACK 
TO PRISON,

170
00:06:54,246 --> 00:06:56,281
AND THEY'VE SEEN ME IN THIS.

171
00:06:56,281 --> 00:07:00,486
- BUSTER? YOU OF ALL PEOPLE. 
WHERE WERE YOU, BUDDY?

172
00:07:00,486 --> 00:07:02,421
YOU BARELY EVEN LEAVE 
MOM'S APARTMENT.

173
00:07:02,421 --> 00:07:03,956
narrator: 
IN FACT, BUSTER WAS WORRIED

174
00:07:03,956 --> 00:07:06,391
ABOUT RUNNING INTO LUCILLE 2.

175
00:07:06,391 --> 00:07:08,528
SO HE NEVER LEFT 
HIS MOTHER'S APARTMENT.

176
00:07:08,528 --> 00:07:10,596
LUCILLE 2 WAS 
ALSO SUPPOSED TO GO,

177
00:07:10,596 --> 00:07:13,365
BUT WAS WAITING UNTIL 
SHE SAW BUSTER EMERGE.

178
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:20,906
- TONIGHT, 
MOTHER WAS HUMILIATED.

179
00:07:20,906 --> 00:07:23,776
AND I WANNA THROW HER ANOTHER 
SURPRISE PARTY--A REAL ONE.

180
00:07:23,776 --> 00:07:26,245
ONE WHERE SHE'S NOT THE ONE 
THAT'S YELLING "SURPRISE."

181
00:07:26,245 --> 00:07:27,246
- MOM YELLED "SURPRISE"?

182
00:07:27,246 --> 00:07:29,749
- YEAH. SHE WENT FROM GIDDY 
TO DEVASTATED.

183
00:07:29,749 --> 00:07:32,384
I MEAN, IT WOULD'VE BEEN FUNNY 
IF IT WASN'T SO--

184
00:07:32,384 --> 00:07:34,754
WELL, IT WAS KIND OF FUNNY.

185
00:07:34,754 --> 00:07:37,022
- WHAT FRAIL ACT GOT YOU 
THIS TIME, MICHAEL?

186
00:07:37,022 --> 00:07:38,023
SHE COULDN'T OPEN A JAR?

187
00:07:38,023 --> 00:07:41,661
WHAT, DID A CLUMP OF HER HAIR 
COME OUT IN YOUR HANDS?

188
00:07:41,661 --> 00:07:42,662
- [laughs]

189
00:07:42,662 --> 00:07:44,464
- NO. IT WAS SOMETHING THAT 
SHE SAID AT DINNER.

190
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:47,199
- IT'S DRY.

191
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:48,734
- YOU KNOW, MOM, I'M SORRY 
YOU'RE UPSET.

192
00:07:48,734 --> 00:07:50,836
BUT, YOU KNOW, 
IF YOU WERE NICER,

193
00:07:50,836 --> 00:07:53,973
THEN MAYBE YOUR KIDS WOULD TAKE 
BETTER CARE OF YOU, YOU KNOW?

194
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:56,441
OR--OR WANNA BE WITH YOU MORE.

195
00:08:00,613 --> 00:08:02,815
- I'VE BEEN 
A HORRIBLE MOTHER.

196
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:05,685
- NO, MOM. 
YOU'RE GREAT.

197
00:08:05,685 --> 00:08:08,120
YOU'VE BEEN A GREAT MOTHER.

198
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:10,189
- WELL, YOU KNOW SHE'S BEEN 
A HORRIBLE MOTHER, RIGHT?

199
00:08:10,189 --> 00:08:11,524
- YOU DON'T HAVE TO TELL ME.

200
00:08:11,524 --> 00:08:15,027
BUT WHAT WAS I GONNA SAY? 
ALL RIGHT? SO, IT'S A PARTY.

201
00:08:16,529 --> 00:08:18,998
I MEAN, IF YOU'RE NOT GONNA DO 
IT FOR MOM, DO IT FOR ME.

202
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:21,734
- OKAY. BUT I THINK 
A PARTY'S A LITTLE EXCESSIVE.

203
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:27,239
- UM, IS IT OKAY IF I DO IT FOR 
MOM AND NOT YOU?

204
00:08:27,239 --> 00:08:30,342
- YEAH. 
- 'CAUSE I REALLY LIKE MOM.

205
00:08:30,342 --> 00:08:33,245
- WE KNOW.

206
00:08:33,245 --> 00:08:34,246
narrator: THE NEXT DAY,

207
00:08:34,246 --> 00:08:35,715
BUSTER DECIDED IT WAS TIME TO 
DEAL WITH...

208
00:08:35,715 --> 00:08:38,250
THE SITUATION WITH 
LUCILLE AUSTERO.

209
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:41,020
- I'VE ALREADY GOT 
A LUCILLE IN MY LIFE.

210
00:08:43,055 --> 00:08:46,559
- I UNDERSTAND. 
THAT'S HEALTHY.

211
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:48,828
- I DIDN'T MEAN TO 
LEAD YOU ON.

212
00:08:48,828 --> 00:08:52,164
- OH, BUSTER, I FEEL SO FOOLISH. 
- NO.

213
00:08:52,164 --> 00:08:56,736
- YES. I'M FOOLISH 
AND I'M FUNNY AND I'M NEEDY.

214
00:08:56,736 --> 00:08:59,038
AM I NEEDY? 
- NO.

215
00:08:59,038 --> 00:09:02,474
- ARE YOU SURE I'M NOT NEEDY? 
'CAUSE I FEEL NEEDY SOMETIMES.

216
00:09:02,474 --> 00:09:05,545
- YOU KNOW, WE'RE PROBABLY 
NOT THAT DIFFERENT, YOU AND ME.

217
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:08,180
YOU AND I. 
IS IT "I" OR IS IT "ME"?

218
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:13,085
- BUSTER, IT'S US. 
- YES. IT IS US. US.

219
00:09:22,928 --> 00:09:26,331
[both chuckle nervously]

220
00:09:26,331 --> 00:09:27,933
narrator: 
UNDER THE PRETENSE OF DRIVING

221
00:09:27,933 --> 00:09:29,534
HIS MOTHER SOMEWHERE ELSE,

222
00:09:29,534 --> 00:09:31,771
MICHAEL, ONCE AGAIN, 
ARRIVED AT THE RESTAURANT.

223
00:09:31,771 --> 00:09:34,473
- MICHAEL, DID YOU 
DO THIS AGAIN?

224
00:09:34,473 --> 00:09:35,474
- SURPRISE!

225
00:09:35,474 --> 00:09:38,878
narrator: AND ONCE AGAIN, 
NO ONE SHOWED UP.

226
00:09:38,878 --> 00:09:40,345
- GET UP.

227
00:09:41,413 --> 00:09:45,150
- I TOLD YOU. 
THEY DON'T SUPPORT ME.

228
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:47,552
- I HATE TO TELL YOU, MOM, BUT 
THEY DON'T SUPPORT ME EITHER.

229
00:09:47,552 --> 00:09:50,856
I SAT DOWN AND I TOLD THEM 
THIS WAS IMPORTANT TO ME.

230
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:53,292
- YOU DID THAT FOR ME?

231
00:09:53,292 --> 00:09:57,663
- I LET YOU DRIVE, 
DIDN'T I?

232
00:09:57,663 --> 00:10:01,266
- YES, YOU DID, MICHAEL, 
AND I'M LOVING IT.

233
00:10:01,266 --> 00:10:02,267
YOU'RE A GOOD SON.

234
00:10:02,267 --> 00:10:04,870
YOU ALWAYS DO THINGS 
FOR OTHERS.

235
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:07,206
YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE 
HOLDING THIS FAMILY TOGETHER.

236
00:10:07,206 --> 00:10:09,842
- AND YOU SEE A LOT MORE THAN 
I GIVE YOU CREDIT FOR, MOM.

237
00:10:09,842 --> 00:10:12,044
YOU'RE NOT JUST CONCERNED 
WITH YOURSELF.

238
00:10:12,044 --> 00:10:13,345
YOU CARE ABOUT THE FAMILY.

239
00:10:14,579 --> 00:10:16,716
HEY. 
IS THAT GOB?

240
00:10:16,716 --> 00:10:20,385
- IT'S AN IDIOT ON A SCOOTER 
AT NIGHT? IT'S GOTTA BE GOB.

241
00:10:20,385 --> 00:10:23,588
LET'S GIVE HIM A SCARE. 
- HMM?

242
00:10:23,588 --> 00:10:24,890
NO, MOM. 
I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD.

243
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:27,392
- A NICE LITTLE SCARE.

244
00:10:27,392 --> 00:10:28,393
[revs engine]

245
00:10:28,393 --> 00:10:32,932
HEY, BIG SHOT, TOO BUSY TO 
GO TO YOUR MOTHER'S PARTY?

246
00:10:32,932 --> 00:10:34,166
- MOM, THAT IS NOT GOB. 
MOM! MOM!

247
00:10:34,166 --> 00:10:36,669
- [tires screech]

248
00:10:36,669 --> 00:10:38,938
[static]

249
00:10:47,847 --> 00:10:51,583
- YOU OKAY, SIR? 
- [groans]

250
00:10:51,583 --> 00:10:55,054
YEAH. I GUESS. 
HOW'S MY MOM? SHE'S SO FRAIL.

251
00:10:55,054 --> 00:10:59,191
- I'M FINE. I'M FINE. 
I WAS THROWN CLEAR.

252
00:10:59,191 --> 00:11:01,994
I ONLY CARE ABOUT YOU.

253
00:11:08,133 --> 00:11:09,134
HOW ARE YOU FEELING?

254
00:11:09,134 --> 00:11:11,937
- ACTUALLY, MY HEAD 
DOES NOT HURT AT ALL.

255
00:11:11,937 --> 00:11:14,039
WHAT DID YOU GIVE ME?

256
00:11:14,039 --> 00:11:17,109
- YOUR MOTHER ASKED ME TO 
PUMP YOU FULL OF--

257
00:11:17,109 --> 00:11:21,080
- CHILDREN'S ASPIRIN. 
- OKAY.

258
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,081
- YOU KNOW, IT'S FUNNY.

259
00:11:22,081 --> 00:11:25,284
I REMEMBER, UM, 
LEAVING THE RESTAURANT.

260
00:11:25,284 --> 00:11:27,619
AND THEN, UH, 
I WAS DRIVING, I GUESS.

261
00:11:27,619 --> 00:11:29,088
I-I JUST-- 
I CANNOT PICTURE IT.

262
00:11:29,088 --> 00:11:30,823
- THAT'S PRETTY COMMON, 
ACTUALLY.

263
00:11:30,823 --> 00:11:32,157
IT'S JUST SHORT-TERM 
MEMORY LOSS

264
00:11:32,157 --> 00:11:34,493
FROM THE BUMP 
ON THE BACK OF YOUR HEAD.

265
00:11:34,493 --> 00:11:35,494
- I CAN'T BELIEVE I DID THIS.

266
00:11:35,494 --> 00:11:38,163
[sighs] MY INSURANCE RATES 
ARE GONNA GO THROUGH THE ROOF.

267
00:11:38,163 --> 00:11:40,900
- THAT'S NOT WHAT MATTERS NOW.

268
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:44,436
HERE, GET COMFORTABLE. 
SCOOT UP.

269
00:11:44,436 --> 00:11:48,073
- "SCOOT"? SCOOTER. 
WAS THERE A SCOOTER INVOLVED?

270
00:11:48,073 --> 00:11:49,074
- [gasps] 
OH, DEAR.

271
00:11:49,074 --> 00:11:52,144
I CAN'T BELIEVE I DID THAT.

272
00:11:52,144 --> 00:11:53,545
I AM SO SORRY. 
I'LL GET YOU SOME AIR.

273
00:11:53,545 --> 00:11:55,380
- I HARDLY FELT IT.

274
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:57,750
IN FACT, ACTUALLY, UH, 
I DIDN'T FEEL IT.

275
00:11:57,750 --> 00:12:01,220
[glass shatters] 
WHAT WAS THAT?

276
00:12:03,756 --> 00:12:07,426
- BUSTER, DO YOU REMEMBER 
WHEN WE WERE KISSING LAST NIGHT?

277
00:12:07,426 --> 00:12:11,831
- IT WAS A WILD, WILD RIDE.

278
00:12:11,831 --> 00:12:14,599
BUT IS THIS SOMETHING 
WE CAN DO?

279
00:12:14,599 --> 00:12:17,669
IS THIS SOMETHING 
SOCIETY WILL ALLOW?

280
00:12:17,669 --> 00:12:20,239
- I DON'T CARE WHAT 
OTHER PEOPLE THINK.

281
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:21,573
MY GOD, FOR THE FIRST TIME 
IN YEARS

282
00:12:21,573 --> 00:12:25,878
I FELT LIKE I WAS STANDING ON 
SOLID GROUND.

283
00:12:25,878 --> 00:12:28,547
- YOU KNOW, 
MY PANIC ATTACKS HAVE DECREASED.

284
00:12:28,547 --> 00:12:33,318
I FEEL CONFIDENT. 
I'M FEELING PROUD EVEN.

285
00:12:33,318 --> 00:12:34,319
[giggles]

286
00:12:34,319 --> 00:12:37,222
I MEAN, FOR THE FIRST TIME 
IN MY LIFE--

287
00:12:37,222 --> 00:12:39,091
[gasps]

288
00:12:43,028 --> 00:12:45,164
- I'LL CALL DR. MILLER.

289
00:12:45,164 --> 00:12:48,400
[cell phone ringing] 
- OH. EXCUSE ME.

290
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:52,972
HELLO. OH, MY GOD. 
I'M GETTING MY GAUZE.

291
00:12:52,972 --> 00:12:54,539
- YOU KNOW, I SHOULD CALL 
GEORGE MICHAEL.

292
00:12:54,539 --> 00:12:56,541
I'M WORRIED ABOUT MY SON.

293
00:12:56,541 --> 00:12:57,542
- I'M WORRIED ABOUT MY SON.

294
00:12:57,542 --> 00:13:00,545
GEORGE MICHAEL WILL BE FINE 
WITH HIS AUNT AND UNCLE.

295
00:13:00,545 --> 00:13:04,149
I WANT YOU RESTING, 
NOT USING THE PHONE.

296
00:13:04,149 --> 00:13:06,151
LET ME TAKE CARE OF YOU.

297
00:13:06,151 --> 00:13:10,689
- YOU KNOW, YOU REALLY ARE MORE 
GENEROUS THAN I CAN REMEMBER.

298
00:13:10,689 --> 00:13:12,424
BUT THAT'S WHAT A PARENT DOES, 
HUH?

299
00:13:12,424 --> 00:13:13,725
YOU PUT YOUR KID FIRST?

300
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:17,529
- REST UP, SWEETIE. 
YOU GAVE ME QUITE A SCARE.

301
00:13:19,631 --> 00:13:23,635
- SCARE. DID SOMEBODY SAY, 
"LET'S GIVE HIM A SC--"

302
00:13:23,635 --> 00:13:24,636
[gasps]

303
00:13:24,636 --> 00:13:28,707
- WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH ME? 
CLUMSY CLARA.

304
00:13:28,707 --> 00:13:30,109
- TOTALLY COOL. 
DIDN'T FEEL A THING.

305
00:13:30,109 --> 00:13:32,277
YOU KNOW, MOM, 
I'M CRAZY ABOUT THIS ASPIRIN.

306
00:13:32,277 --> 00:13:35,480
I CAN'T BELIEVE 
WE GIVE IT TO CHILDREN.

307
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:36,548
narrator: GOB, MEANWHILE,

308
00:13:36,548 --> 00:13:39,284
WAS BEING VISITED BY 
MICHAEL'S SON, GEORGE MICHAEL.

309
00:13:39,284 --> 00:13:41,520
- MICHAEL? 
GEORGE MICHAEL.

310
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:44,189
YOU'VE GOTTA GO. 
- WAIT.

311
00:13:44,189 --> 00:13:45,190
[water splashes]

312
00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:46,926
- UNCLE GOB, IS THIS A BAD TIME?

313
00:13:46,926 --> 00:13:50,329
- NO. ARE YOU KIDDING? 
SO, WHAT'S UP?

314
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:53,866
- I, UH, NEED YOU TO MAKE SOME 
FAKE I.D.'S FOR ME AND MAEBY.

315
00:13:53,866 --> 00:13:54,867
- LIKE A PASSPORT?

316
00:13:54,867 --> 00:13:56,768
- YEAH, YEAH. 
THAT'D BE GREAT.

317
00:13:56,768 --> 00:13:58,070
OH, AND, UH, 
PREFERABLY FRENCH.

318
00:13:58,070 --> 00:14:00,906
I LIKE THE WAY THEY THINK.

319
00:14:00,906 --> 00:14:03,042
- LOOK, I DON'T WANT YOU 
THINKING THAT YOUR UNCLE IS SOME

320
00:14:03,042 --> 00:14:04,843
SLEAZY CHARACTER FROM THE DOCKS.

321
00:14:04,843 --> 00:14:07,379
GOOD MORNING. 
- HOW ARE YOU?

322
00:14:09,148 --> 00:14:12,885
- SHE'S AN OLYMPIAN... 
HOPEFUL.

323
00:14:12,885 --> 00:14:13,986
SWIMMING AND SOME COACHING.

324
00:14:13,986 --> 00:14:15,921
YES, I WILL MAKE 
THE I.D.'S FOR YOU.

325
00:14:15,921 --> 00:14:17,522
BUT WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO 
MAKE THIS QUICK.

326
00:14:17,522 --> 00:14:19,925
YOUR DAD 
WANTS ME OUT OF HERE BY NOON.

327
00:14:19,925 --> 00:14:22,361
- OH, NO, I WOULDN'T WORRY ABOUT 
HIM. HE'S STAYING AT GANGY'S.

328
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:23,395
YEAH, HE GOT IN A CAR ACCIDENT

329
00:14:23,395 --> 00:14:24,763
ON THE WAY BACK FROM 
HER BIRTHDAY PARTY.

330
00:14:24,763 --> 00:14:26,165
- OH, MAN, I TOLD HIM 
NOT TO LET HER DRIVE.

331
00:14:26,165 --> 00:14:27,366
- NO. IT WAS HIM DRIVING.

332
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:28,700
SHE'S TAKING GOOD CARE OF 
HIM TOO.

333
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:31,203
SHE WON'T EVEN 
LET HIM USE THE PHONE.

334
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:33,138
- SO YOU'RE TELLING ME THAT HE 
CAN'T GO ANYWHERE AND

335
00:14:33,138 --> 00:14:35,640
HE'S INCOMMUNICADO? 
- RIGHT.

336
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:37,676
narrator: THAT'S WHEN 
GOB DECIDED TO TAKE THE YACHT

337
00:14:37,676 --> 00:14:39,244
TO SOUTH AMERICA FOR THE SUMMER.

338
00:14:39,244 --> 00:14:42,714
- I GOTTA ALERT 
THIS BOAT'S CREW.

339
00:14:43,815 --> 00:14:45,885
THEY'LL BE DEVASTATED.

340
00:14:47,586 --> 00:14:51,991
narrator: LINDSAY PUT ON HER NEW 
OUTFIT AND RETURNED TO PRISON.

341
00:14:59,598 --> 00:15:00,599
BACK AT LUCILLE'S,

342
00:15:00,599 --> 00:15:03,668
MICHAEL WAS STILL 
PIECING TOGETHER THE ACCIDENT.

343
00:15:03,668 --> 00:15:06,471
- HEY, BUSTER. 
- HEY, BROTHER.

344
00:15:08,273 --> 00:15:10,910
- DR. MILLER? 
- YEAH.

345
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:15,547
I JUST JUMPED THROUGH A PLATE 
GLASS WINDOW ON A DATE. [laughs]

346
00:15:15,547 --> 00:15:17,582
- OH. WELL, 
WOMEN LOVE TO LAUGH.

347
00:15:17,582 --> 00:15:18,583
- IT WAS WORTH IT

348
00:15:18,583 --> 00:15:22,187
TO BE AWAY FROM 
MOM'S CONTROLLING GRASP.

349
00:15:22,187 --> 00:15:26,591
- BUSTER, WHAT'S GOING ON? 
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR HEAD?

350
00:15:26,591 --> 00:15:27,592
- NOTHING.

351
00:15:27,592 --> 00:15:30,295
GOB WAS JUST TEACHING ME 
HOW TO HIT IT WITH A HAMMER.

352
00:15:30,295 --> 00:15:32,864
- GOB WAS THERE.

353
00:15:32,864 --> 00:15:35,600
GOB WAS ON HIS SCOOTER.

354
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,602
[gasps] I THINK I WANTED TO 
HIT GOB.

355
00:15:37,602 --> 00:15:39,038
- YES. THAT IS EXACTLY 
WHAT HAPPENED.

356
00:15:39,038 --> 00:15:42,507
YOU WANTED TO 
GIVE GOB A SCARE.

357
00:15:42,507 --> 00:15:44,376
I DON'T KNOW WHY.

358
00:15:47,112 --> 00:15:48,780
- I THINK I DO.

359
00:15:50,815 --> 00:15:52,851
THANKS, MOM.

360
00:15:57,256 --> 00:15:58,857
narrator: GEORGE SENIOR WAS, 
ONCE AGAIN,

361
00:15:58,857 --> 00:16:00,325
BEING VISITED BY HIS DAUGHTER.

362
00:16:00,325 --> 00:16:02,594
THAT'S IT. I DON'T WANT-- 
YOU CAN'T--I DON'T--

363
00:16:02,594 --> 00:16:04,663
PLEASE, YOU GOTTA STOP 
COMING HERE.

364
00:16:04,663 --> 00:16:06,698
- IT IS OBVIOUS 
I'M NOT WEARING A BRA, RIGHT?

365
00:16:06,698 --> 00:16:07,699
- I CAN'T TAKE THIS ANYMORE.

366
00:16:07,699 --> 00:16:12,137
I, UM--UH, I'M PAYING 
FAR TOO BIG A PRICE FOR THIS.

367
00:16:12,137 --> 00:16:13,138
- WELL, WHAT ABOUT ME?

368
00:16:13,138 --> 00:16:15,440
THIS IS THE THIRD TIME 
I'VE COME HERE.

369
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,009
I HAVEN'T EVEN BEEN 
REMOTELY HARASSED.

370
00:16:17,009 --> 00:16:19,644
- THAT IS NOT WHAT I'M PAYING 
FOR.

371
00:16:19,644 --> 00:16:22,814
- HAVE I LOST IT? 
DID I EVER EVEN HAVE IT?

372
00:16:22,814 --> 00:16:25,084
- I'M PAYING THOUSANDS 
OF DOLLARS IN KRUGERRANDS.

373
00:16:25,084 --> 00:16:27,386
- WHAT? 
- GOLD. KRUGERRANDS.

374
00:16:27,386 --> 00:16:28,487
YOUR MOTHER SNUCK 'EM IN HERE

375
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:31,690
STUFFED IN ENERGY BAR 
WRAPPERS...

376
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:33,025
TO KEEP ME FROM GETTING 
STRANGLED

377
00:16:33,025 --> 00:16:35,694
IN THE SHOWER OR WORSE.

378
00:16:35,694 --> 00:16:39,098
- STABBED? 
- IN A WAY.

379
00:16:39,098 --> 00:16:42,401
I USED THEM TO PAY OFF 
THE OTHER GUYS.

380
00:16:42,401 --> 00:16:44,003
TO STOP THEM FROM HOLLERING 
OBSCENITIES

381
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:47,539
AT MY--MY LITTLE GIRL.

382
00:16:47,539 --> 00:16:51,976
BUT YOU KEEP COMING BACK HERE, 
HONEY, AND I'M GOING BROKE.

383
00:16:53,645 --> 00:16:56,315
- THAT'S ALL I EVER WANTED 
FROM YOU, DADDY.

384
00:16:58,483 --> 00:17:00,819
FOR YOU TO 
SPEND MONEY ON ME.

385
00:17:02,387 --> 00:17:04,589
- NO TOUCHING!

386
00:17:05,890 --> 00:17:08,660
- GOB, I WANT YOU TO 
MOVE BACK ON TO THE YACHT.

387
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:09,661
- THE YACHT?

388
00:17:09,661 --> 00:17:11,896
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK 
I'D WANT TO NOW?

389
00:17:11,896 --> 00:17:13,932
- WELL, I KNOW THAT 
YOU'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR--

390
00:17:13,932 --> 00:17:15,400
[horn blows] 
WHAT WAS THAT?

391
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,502
- I THINK THAT WAS ON 
YOUR END.

392
00:17:17,502 --> 00:17:19,271
- THE TRUTH IS, I CAN WAIT 
ON SELLING THE YACHT.

393
00:17:19,271 --> 00:17:20,972
IT'S JUST MONEY, RIGHT?

394
00:17:20,972 --> 00:17:23,708
- WOW. HOW HARD DID YOU HIT 
THAT STEERING WHEEL?

395
00:17:23,708 --> 00:17:25,110
- I ACTUALLY HIT 
THE BACK OF MY HEAD.

396
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:26,945
- THE BACK OF YOUR HEAD?

397
00:17:26,945 --> 00:17:30,715
- YEAH. GOB, THE ACCIDENT 
ONLY HAPPENED BECAUSE...

398
00:17:30,715 --> 00:17:33,285
I WAS TRYING TO SCARE YOU.

399
00:17:33,285 --> 00:17:36,488
MAYBE EVEN HURT YOU. 
- THAT DOESN'T SOUND LIKE YOU.

400
00:17:36,488 --> 00:17:38,523
IT SOUNDS LIKE MOM.

401
00:17:38,523 --> 00:17:41,393
- CAN WE PLEASE JUST LAY 
OFF MOM FOR A CHANGE?

402
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:43,462
SHE'S THE ONE THAT HELPED ME 
REMEMBER WHAT HAPPENED.

403
00:17:43,462 --> 00:17:45,130
I'M THE BAD GUY HERE. 
NOT HER.

404
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:46,231
AND DEFINITELY NOT YOU,

405
00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:50,069
SO, WOULD YOU PLEASE 
JUST TAKE THE YACHT?

406
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:52,671
- I'LL THINK ABOUT IT.

407
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:58,143
SOUTH AMERICA SOUNDS GOOD.

408
00:17:58,143 --> 00:18:01,513
BUT A CHANCE TO EXPOSE MOM?

409
00:18:01,513 --> 00:18:03,482
TURN THIS SKIFF AROUND.

410
00:18:03,482 --> 00:18:05,850
- WE HAVEN'T EVEN 
LEFT THE DOCK.

411
00:18:07,519 --> 00:18:09,821
- BUT "SKIFF" IS 
APPROPRIATE, RIGHT?

412
00:18:09,821 --> 00:18:12,557
narrator: GOB RUSHED TO SHORE 
TO SPARE HIS BROTHER...

413
00:18:12,557 --> 00:18:15,860
FROM WHAT HE WAS CERTAIN 
WERE HIS MOTHER'S MACHINATIONS.

414
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:18,930
-  WHAT ARE YOU DOING? 
- HEY. OPEN THIS DOOR.

415
00:18:18,930 --> 00:18:21,032
- YOU'VE BEEN SET UP. 
- MICHAEL!

416
00:18:21,032 --> 00:18:22,601
- THERE'S NO WAY YOU WERE TRYING 
TO HURT ME.

417
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:23,935
YOU DON'T HATE ME.

418
00:18:23,935 --> 00:18:26,638
MOM HATES ME. 
YOU KIND OF LIKE ME.

419
00:18:26,638 --> 00:18:28,340
- YEAH. I KIND OF LIKE YOU. 
- YEAH.

420
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:31,276
- MICHAEL, I NEED YOUR HELP. 
- COMING.

421
00:18:31,276 --> 00:18:34,346
OW! I GOT HIT BACK THERE. 
- RIGHT!

422
00:18:34,346 --> 00:18:35,347
ON THE BACK OF THE HEAD,

423
00:18:35,347 --> 00:18:37,749
WHICH MEANS THAT YOU COULDN'T 
HAVE HIT THE STEERING WHEEL.

424
00:18:37,749 --> 00:18:39,684
MOM MUST HAVE CLUBBED YOU 
WITH A CHAMPAGNE BOTTLE

425
00:18:39,684 --> 00:18:40,919
OR SOMETHING SO SHE COULD DRIVE.

426
00:18:40,919 --> 00:18:42,086
- GOB, HOW'D YOU 
FIGURE IT OUT?

427
00:18:42,086 --> 00:18:43,722
- WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT, IT'S 
FUNNY YOU SHOULD ASK THAT--

428
00:18:43,722 --> 00:18:46,057
- NO. HE DIDN'T FIGURE 
ANYTHING OUT.

429
00:18:46,057 --> 00:18:47,626
I PROBABLY GOT HIT ON 
THE BACK OF THE HEAD

430
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:49,261
BECAUSE OF BUSTER'S ROCK.

431
00:18:49,261 --> 00:18:50,629
- HEY, BIG SHOT! 
[knocking]

432
00:18:52,697 --> 00:18:54,899
- WHICH WAS BEHIND 
THE PASSENGER SEAT.

433
00:18:54,899 --> 00:18:57,269
- WHICH MEANS THAT SHE PICKED 
YOU UP

434
00:18:57,269 --> 00:18:59,204
AND DRAGGED YOU OVER 
TO THE DRIVER'S SEAT.

435
00:18:59,204 --> 00:19:00,372
- MOM CAN'T PICK ME UP.

436
00:19:00,372 --> 00:19:02,674
SHE COULD BARELY PICK UP 
THAT BAG OF PROTEIN BARS.

437
00:19:04,042 --> 00:19:05,910
- GUESS WHAT? 
THEY WEREN'T PROTEIN BARS.

438
00:19:05,910 --> 00:19:07,879
THEY WERE GOLD KRUGERRANDS.

439
00:19:07,879 --> 00:19:10,482
AND DAD FINALLY PAID ATTENTION 
TO MY INTELLECT.

440
00:19:10,482 --> 00:19:12,217
- OPEN THIS DOOR! 
- GOB, THIS IS NUTS.

441
00:19:12,217 --> 00:19:14,986
MOTHER IS FRAIL. 
[clattering]

442
00:19:14,986 --> 00:19:16,721
- STOP THIS NONSENSE 
THIS INSTANT!

443
00:19:16,721 --> 00:19:17,722
- YOU SET HIM UP, MOM.

444
00:19:17,722 --> 00:19:18,923
I WAS HALFWAY TO SOUTH AMERICA,

445
00:19:18,923 --> 00:19:21,193
BUT I COULDN'T LET YOU 
GET AWAY WITH IT...

446
00:19:21,193 --> 00:19:24,663
BECAUSE WE'RE BROTHERS, MOM, 
AND WE KIND OF LIKE EACH OTHER.

447
00:19:26,865 --> 00:19:28,800
- YOU WERE GOING TO 
SOUTH AMERICA?

448
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,269
- I DON'T THINK SO.

449
00:19:32,271 --> 00:19:33,872
- MOM, YOU AND I 
WERE GETTING ALONG SO WELL.

450
00:19:33,872 --> 00:19:35,174
I WAS THINKING SO HIGHLY OF YOU.

451
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:37,876
HOW COULD YOU MAKE ME THINK 
THIS WAS ALL MY FAULT?

452
00:19:37,876 --> 00:19:39,278
- BECAUSE IF YOU KNEW 
IT WAS MY FAULT,

453
00:19:39,278 --> 00:19:40,312
YOU WOULD'VE TURNED AGAINST ME.

454
00:19:40,312 --> 00:19:41,846
AND I HAD FINALLY 
GOTTEN YOU ON MY SIDE.

455
00:19:41,846 --> 00:19:44,683
YOU WERE STICKING UP FOR ME.

456
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:48,220
I-I DON'T EVEN REMEMBER 
YOU EVER DOING THAT BEFORE.

457
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:51,022
I JUST WANT MY CHILDREN 
TO LOVE ME.

458
00:19:51,022 --> 00:19:55,327
- STOP LYING. STOP MANIPULATING. 
JUST BE NICER.

459
00:19:55,327 --> 00:19:57,429
- BUT--

460
00:20:04,503 --> 00:20:06,538
YOU'RE RIGHT.

461
00:20:11,876 --> 00:20:15,013
I'M A HORRIBLE MOTHER.

462
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:18,617
- NO, NO, MOM. 
YOU'RE GREAT.

463
00:20:18,617 --> 00:20:21,386
- THAT'S CRAZY TALK.

464
00:20:21,386 --> 00:20:22,454
- YOU'RE A FANTASTIC MOTHER.

465
00:20:22,454 --> 00:20:23,855
- I CAN'T BELIEVE 
WHAT I'M HEARING, MOTHER.

466
00:20:23,855 --> 00:20:26,225
- OH, WE DO. 
WE REALLY LOVE YOU.

ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT.

GEORGE MICHAEL AND MAEBY SNEAK 
BACK INTO LES COUSINS DANGEREUX.

469
00:20:32,497 --> 00:20:33,498
- EXCUSE ME.

470
00:20:33,498 --> 00:20:35,367
YOU'RE TOO YOUNG TO BE 
HOLDING THAT TICKET.

471
00:20:35,367 --> 00:20:37,168
- LET'S GO. 
- I CAN'T GO TO JAIL.

472
00:20:37,168 --> 00:20:38,237
- LET'S JUST WATCH CARTOONS.

473
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:40,439
- SIR, WE WILL NOT BE 
STARTING WITH LES COUSINS...

474
00:20:40,439 --> 00:20:41,440
- UNTIL YOU LEAVE.

475
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:44,243
- EXCUSE ME, BUT I THOUGHT 
MY A.A.R.P. CARD...

476
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:45,310
WAS GOOD FOR ONE AND A GUEST.

477
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:47,812
- YOU KNOW WHAT? I KNEW SOCIETY 
WOULD NEVER ACCEPT THIS.

478
00:20:47,812 --> 00:20:48,813
AND THEY NEVER WILL.

479

OW!

482
00:21:00,459 --> 00:21:02,861
- I WAS DEFINITELY DRIVING 
THAT TIME.
