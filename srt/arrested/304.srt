00:00:01,376 --> 00:00:02,585
narrator: NOW THE STORY

2
00:00:02,585 --> 00:00:04,295
OF A WEALTHY FAMILY 
WHO LOST EVERYTHING

3
00:00:04,295 --> 00:00:06,214
AND THE ONE SON 
WHO HAD NO CHOICE

4
00:00:06,214 --> 00:00:07,840
BUT TO KEEP THEM ALL TOGETHER.

5
00:00:13,638 --> 00:00:15,473
IT'S "ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT."

6
00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:19,352
MICHAEL WAS HEADING TO WORK

7
00:00:19,352 --> 00:00:21,937
WHEN HE SAW SOMETHING HE HAD 
NEVER SEEN BEFORE LUNCH--

8
00:00:21,937 --> 00:00:23,939
HIS TWIN SISTER LINDSAY.

9
00:00:23,939 --> 00:00:24,899
- YOU'RE UP?

10
00:00:24,899 --> 00:00:27,068
- YEAH. I WORK 
FOR OUR ATTORNEY NOW.

11
00:00:27,068 --> 00:00:30,488
- BOB LOBLAW. OF COURSE. 
WHAT IS HE THINKING?

12
00:00:30,488 --> 00:00:31,322
I MEAN, HOW'S IT GOING?

13
00:00:31,322 --> 00:00:32,698
- LOUSY.

14
00:00:32,698 --> 00:00:34,284
YOU KNOW, I ONLY TOOK 
THIS NANNY JOB

15
00:00:34,284 --> 00:00:36,244
SO HE'D GIVE ME A FREE DIVORCE 
AND THEN MARRY ME

16
00:00:36,244 --> 00:00:38,454
SO I'D NEVER 
HAVE TO WORK AGAIN.

17
00:00:38,454 --> 00:00:40,873
BUT ALL HE SEEMS TO CARE ABOUT 
IS THAT DAUGHTER OF HIS.

18
00:00:40,873 --> 00:00:43,084
- I GOT MY HORSE TO CANTER 
TODAY. FIRST TIME.

19
00:00:43,084 --> 00:00:45,420
- I'VE ALWAYS WANTED 
TO MAKE LOVE ON A HORSE.

20
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:47,463
- AND TOMORROW, WE'RE GONNA 
WORK WITHOUT A LUNGE LINE.

21
00:00:47,463 --> 00:00:50,841
- THAT'S SO FUNNY, BECAUSE 
I CAN PUT MY LEG BEHIND MY HEAD.

22
00:00:50,841 --> 00:00:53,261
I MEAN, COME ON, 
I'M THE NANNY.

23
00:00:53,261 --> 00:00:55,346
- OF COURSE. WHO WOULDN'T WANNA 
SNOG THE NANNY?

24
00:00:55,346 --> 00:00:57,557
- "SNOG." IS THAT ANOTHER 
ONE OF YOUR NEW BRITISHISMS?

25
00:00:57,557 --> 00:00:58,641
narrator: IT WAS.

26
00:00:58,641 --> 00:01:01,894
MICHAEL HAD RECENTLY 
FALLEN BUM OVER NOGGIN

27
00:01:01,894 --> 00:01:04,314
FOR A BEAUTIFUL ENGLISH WOMAN 
CALLED RITA.

28
00:01:04,314 --> 00:01:06,274
- DID I SAY SNOG AGAIN? 
BLOODY HELL.

29
00:01:06,274 --> 00:01:09,569
LISTEN, YOU WANNA WIN OVER BOB, 
YOU GOTTA WIN OVER THE KID,

30
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:10,528
AND HERE'S WHAT YOU DO.

31
00:01:10,528 --> 00:01:12,280
YOU FIND SOMETHING 
THAT YOU'RE GOOD AT,

32
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:13,156
AND YOU SHARE IT WITH HER.

33
00:01:13,156 --> 00:01:15,075
WHILE YOU'RE AT IT, 
SHARE IT WITH US TOO, HUH?

34
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:16,409
AND TRY NOT TO ACT SO DESPERATE.

35
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:18,453
OH, MY GOD. 
DID I MISS A CALL?

36
00:01:18,453 --> 00:01:20,538
- THIS IS RITA. 
JUST WANTED TO SAY HI.

37
00:01:20,538 --> 00:01:23,166
I'M ON MY WAY TO THE TRAIN 
STATION. BYE-BYE.

38
00:01:23,166 --> 00:01:25,293
- SHE'S LEAVING. 
I GOTTA GET OVER THERE.

39
00:01:25,293 --> 00:01:27,086
narrator: 
MICHAEL RACED TO THE STATION.

40
00:01:27,086 --> 00:01:29,797
- GOD, IS THAT HOW I LOOK?

41
00:01:29,797 --> 00:01:32,091
narrator: WHERE RITA WAS BEING 
GIVEN HER TICKET.

42
00:01:32,091 --> 00:01:34,009
- HERE'S YOUR TICKET 
AND YOUR INSTRUCTIONS.

43
00:01:34,009 --> 00:01:38,306
CALL ME IF YOU GET IN 
OVER YOUR HEAD.

44
00:01:38,306 --> 00:01:40,975
- HEY, HI THERE, RITA. 
HEY, MICHAEL.

45
00:01:40,975 --> 00:01:45,271
HI. WHERE ARE YOU GOING, 
AND HOW LONG YOU GOING FOR?

46
00:01:45,271 --> 00:01:47,190
YOU'RE RIGHT. YOU-YOU-- 
DO NOT ANSWER THAT.

47
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:48,733
YOU KNOW, 
I'M NOT GETTING CLINGY.

48
00:01:48,733 --> 00:01:50,193
- WHY ARE YOU BREATHING 
LIKE THAT?

49
00:01:50,193 --> 00:01:52,237
- OH, I WASN'T HURRYING 
TO COME STOP YOU.

50
00:01:52,237 --> 00:01:53,613
I WAS OUT ON--- 
FOR MY DAILY, UH--

51
00:01:53,613 --> 00:01:55,156
DO YOU RUN AT ALL?

52
00:01:55,156 --> 00:01:57,992
- OH, YES. 
I WAS IN THE OLYMPICS ONCE.

53
00:01:57,992 --> 00:01:59,076
I WON A SILVER MEDAL.

54
00:01:59,076 --> 00:02:03,289
- YOU'RE THAT RITA LEEDS? 
OH, MY GOODNESS!

55
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:06,041
AND A SILVER MEDAL, YES. 
YOU CAME IN SECOND.

56
00:02:06,041 --> 00:02:07,252
NOW I'M VERY EMBARRASSED

57
00:02:07,252 --> 00:02:08,961
TO BE OUT OF BREATH 
IN FRONT OF YOU.

58
00:02:08,961 --> 00:02:12,507
BUT YOU TAKE MY BREATH AWAY.

59
00:02:12,507 --> 00:02:15,718
- OH, MICHAEL.

60
00:02:15,718 --> 00:02:19,514
YOU'RE SUCH A [bleep].

61
00:02:19,514 --> 00:02:21,098
narrator: 
MICHAEL WAS STUNNED.

62
00:02:21,098 --> 00:02:23,351
HE ASSUMED RITA 
WAS USING THE WORD [bleep]

63
00:02:23,351 --> 00:02:27,355
IN THE AMERICAN SENSE, 
MEANING "WEAK" OR "COWARDLY."

64
00:02:27,355 --> 00:02:29,899
IN FACT, RITA MEANT IT 
IN THE BRITISH SENSE,

65
00:02:29,899 --> 00:02:32,818
MEANING "SWEET" OR "GENTLE," 
AS IN "PUSSYCAT."

66
00:02:32,818 --> 00:02:34,111
- THE JERRIES AREN'T SO BAD.

67
00:02:34,111 --> 00:02:36,071
THEY'RE JUST BEING LED 
BY A ROTTEN APPLE.

68
00:02:36,071 --> 00:02:37,823
- OH, REGGIE. 
FIGHTING FOR YOUR COUNTRY,

69
00:02:37,823 --> 00:02:41,076
YOU'RE SUCH A PUSSY.

70
00:02:41,076 --> 00:02:42,245
- WHEN I MISS YOUR LIPS,

71
00:02:42,245 --> 00:02:45,873
I'LL PUT A [bleep] 
IN MY MOUTH AND THINK OF YOU.

72
00:02:45,873 --> 00:02:50,044
narrator: THAT ALSO HAD 
A DIFFERENT MEANING OVER THERE.

73
00:02:50,044 --> 00:02:52,380
MICHAEL RETURNED HOME,

74
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:55,258
HOPING TO TAKE SOLACE 
IN HIS SON'S COMPANY.

75
00:02:55,258 --> 00:02:57,718
- THINKING YOU AND I SHOULD 
MAYBE GO PLAY A LITTLE CATCH.

76
00:02:57,718 --> 00:03:00,054
YOU KNOW, MAYBE GO FOR A RUN. 
DO SOME GUY STUFF.

77
00:03:00,054 --> 00:03:01,556
- BUT WE'RE NOT GOOD 
AT THAT STUFF.

78
00:03:01,556 --> 00:03:04,058
- YES, I AM. WE BOTH ARE.

79
00:03:04,058 --> 00:03:06,436
narrator: MICHAEL AND HIS SON 
HAD NEVER BEEN

80
00:03:06,436 --> 00:03:09,063
A VERY SUCCESSFUL 
ATHLETIC TEAM.

81
00:03:09,063 --> 00:03:11,732
IN FACT, THE ONLY THING 
GEORGE MICHAEL REALLY LIKED

82
00:03:11,732 --> 00:03:14,610
WAS HANGING MOTIONLESS 
FROM THE MONKEY BARS,

83
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:17,280
WHICH THE PRESIDENT'S COUNSEL 
ON FITNESS RANKS AS

84
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,615
"SLIGHTLY EASIER 
THAN THE SLIDE."

85
00:03:19,615 --> 00:03:20,991
- ANYWAY, I WAS JUST THINKING

86
00:03:20,991 --> 00:03:23,411
THAT MAYBE WE SHOULD 
EMPHASIZE ATHLETICS

87
00:03:23,411 --> 00:03:25,871
A LITTLE BIT MORE 
IN THIS FAMILY.

88
00:03:25,871 --> 00:03:28,082
I'M GONNA START US OFF 
WITH A PROTEIN DRINK, OKAY?

89
00:03:28,082 --> 00:03:29,792
STILL DOING THAT, HUH?

90
00:03:31,126 --> 00:03:33,003
WELL, I-I DO THINK 
WE SHOULD GO FOR A RUN, HUH?

91
00:03:33,003 --> 00:03:34,714
SOME REAL GUY STUFF.

92
00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:36,924
- I'M SUPPOSED TO GO FABRIC 
SHOPPING WITH ANN TODAY.

93
00:03:36,924 --> 00:03:40,135
- I THINK WE CAN GO BUTCHER.

94
00:03:40,135 --> 00:03:42,179
- UH, UH, NO. 
WE'RE-WE'RE MAKING A GOWN.

95
00:03:42,179 --> 00:03:43,681
SHE'S GONNA BE IN 
A BEAUTY PAGEANT.

96
00:03:43,681 --> 00:03:45,266
- YEAH. WHO'S ANN?

97
00:03:45,266 --> 00:03:46,684
- MY-MY GIRLFRIEND. SHE'S--

98
00:03:46,684 --> 00:03:49,144
YOU'VE MET HER SO MANY TIMES, 
MET HER AND MET HER.

99
00:03:49,144 --> 00:03:50,980
- NO, I KNOW WHO ANNABELLE IS.

100
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:52,815
WHO'S THE ANN THAT'S IN 
THE BEAUTY PAGEANT?

101
00:03:52,815 --> 00:03:53,858
- THAT'S HER.

102
00:03:53,858 --> 00:03:55,526
HER NAME ISN'T ANNABELLE. 
THAT'S ANN.

103
00:03:55,526 --> 00:03:57,570
- NO, I KNOW THAT HER NAME 
IS NOT ANNABELLE. I JUST--

104
00:03:57,570 --> 00:03:58,946
THAT'S HOW I REMEMBER HER NAME.

105
00:03:58,946 --> 00:04:00,740
'CAUSE HER BODY'S KIND OF 
SHAPED LIKE A--

106
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:02,032
SHE'S THE BELLE OF THE BALL.

107
00:04:02,032 --> 00:04:04,535
WHAT IS SHE DOIN' 
IN THE BEAUTY PAGEANT?

108
00:04:04,535 --> 00:04:06,412
SHE'S--IS SHE RUNNING 
THE LIGHTS OR SOMETHING?

109
00:04:06,412 --> 00:04:08,706
- SHE'S IN IT. 
SHE'S A-A CONTESTANT.

110
00:04:08,706 --> 00:04:10,458
IT'S SORT OF LIKE 
AN INNER BEAUTY PAGEANT.

111
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:12,084
- AH! THERE IT IS.

112
00:04:12,084 --> 00:04:13,336
IS IT LIKE A CHRISTIAN THING?

113
00:04:13,336 --> 00:04:15,087
- WELL, IT'S HALF.

114
00:04:15,087 --> 00:04:16,256
IT'S AT THE STATE FAIR,

115
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:18,424
WHICH THIS YEAR'S GONNA BE 
A CHURCH AND STATE FAIR.

116
00:04:18,424 --> 00:04:21,135
narrator: IT SEEMS THE STATE 
HAD RUN OUT OF MONEY

117
00:04:21,135 --> 00:04:23,596
AND WAS GOING TO CANCEL 
THE FAIR

118
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:26,557
UNTIL IT WAS RESURRECTED 
BY THIS MAN,

119
00:04:26,557 --> 00:04:28,768
WHO AGREED TO COVER 
THE FAIR'S COSTS

120
00:04:28,768 --> 00:04:30,811
IF IT INCLUDED 
A CHURCH PRESENCE.

121
00:04:30,811 --> 00:04:32,021
- I GOT SOME NEWS FOR YOU.

122
00:04:32,021 --> 00:04:34,357
THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS 
AN INNER BEAUTY PAGEANT.

123
00:04:34,357 --> 00:04:37,151
THEY'RE JUST GONNA PICK THE 
CHICK WITH THE BEST T AND A.

124
00:04:37,151 --> 00:04:39,236
narrator: AS A CHILD, 
MAEBY HAD BEEN ENTERED

125
00:04:39,236 --> 00:04:41,447
INTO A NUMBER 
OF PROGRESSIVE PAGEANTS

126
00:04:41,447 --> 00:04:44,325
THAT CLAIMED TO CELEBRATE 
BEAUTY IN ALL ITS FORMS.

127
00:04:44,325 --> 00:04:47,828
BUT THE WINNERS STILL TENDED 
TO HAVE IT GOING ON

128
00:04:47,828 --> 00:04:49,038
IN THE CONVENTIONAL SENSE.

129
00:04:49,038 --> 00:04:51,582
- REMEMBER HOW BADLY 
YOU USED TO WANT TO WIN?

130
00:04:51,582 --> 00:04:53,626
- NO, I REMEMBER HOW BADLY 
YOU USED TO WANT ME TO WIN.

131
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:54,126
- YEAH, WE SHOULD HAVE.

132
00:04:54,126 --> 00:04:56,170
I DON'T KNOW WHERE 
THAT HAIR OF YOURS CAME FROM.

133
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:58,673
- SHAMELESS PLUGS ON PLACENTIA.

134
00:04:58,673 --> 00:04:59,882
LOOKS PRETTY GOOD, HUH?

135
00:04:59,882 --> 00:05:02,635
AND THEY'RE NOT LICENSED, 
WHICH MEANS BIG SAVINGS.

136
00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:03,719
[glass shatters]

137
00:05:03,719 --> 00:05:07,014
THAT'S BEEN HAPPENING 
A LOT LATELY.

138
00:05:07,014 --> 00:05:09,016
- YOU KNOW WHAT? THIS IS 
THE PERFECT THING TO DO.

139
00:05:09,016 --> 00:05:10,267
- NO, MOM, I'M NOT GONNA DO IT.

140
00:05:10,267 --> 00:05:13,313
- NO, NO, NOT YOU. 
BOB'S DAUGHTER HOPE.

141
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:16,190
IF I CAN GET HOPE THIS CROWN,

142
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:18,025
MAYBE HER FATHER 
MIGHT JUST WANNA CROWN ME,

143
00:05:18,025 --> 00:05:19,819
IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

144
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:21,028
- I'M GUESSING HAVE SEX,

145
00:05:21,028 --> 00:05:22,947
BUT THAT'S MEETING YOU 
MORE THAN HALFWAY.

146
00:05:22,947 --> 00:05:24,407
TOBIAS, WANNA CLEAN UP 
THAT MIRROR?

147
00:05:24,407 --> 00:05:26,909
AND THE VASE?

148
00:05:26,909 --> 00:05:28,661
- PERHAPS IF I COULD COACH

149
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:31,456
A CERTAIN YOUNG LADY 
TO VICTORY IN THIS PAGEANT,

150
00:05:31,456 --> 00:05:34,334
I CAN GAIN BACK 
THE RESPECT OF MY WIFE.

151
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:35,793
I'LL SHOW THEM 
A LITTLE T AND A.

152
00:05:35,793 --> 00:05:37,044
- YOU CAN'T MAKE ME DO IT, DAD.

153
00:05:37,044 --> 00:05:39,296
- TOBIAS AND ANN.

154
00:05:39,296 --> 00:05:40,506
- MY ANN?

155
00:05:40,506 --> 00:05:42,216
NO, I DON'T--I DON'T THINK 
WE NEED ANY HELP.

156
00:05:42,216 --> 00:05:44,218
- OH, GEORGE MICHAEL, 
SHE'S A GIRL.

157
00:05:44,218 --> 00:05:46,721
I NEED TO TEACH HER 
HOW TO BE A WOMAN.

158
00:05:46,721 --> 00:05:48,180
WITHIN HER LIES A QUEEN.

159
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:51,601
LET ME OUT THAT QUEEN.

160
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:53,310
- I THINK YOU JUST DID.

161
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:54,895
- MICHAEL. 
- GOB.

162
00:05:54,895 --> 00:05:58,023
- OH, LET ME GET THAT FOR YOU. 
UM--

163
00:05:58,023 --> 00:05:59,442
SO A YOUNG NEIGHBORHOOD TOUGH

164
00:05:59,442 --> 00:06:02,737
BY THE NAME OF STEVE HOLT'S 
GONNA BE HERE ANY MINUTE.

165
00:06:02,737 --> 00:06:03,571
- YOUR SON.

166
00:06:03,571 --> 00:06:04,947
- ACCORDING TO HIM.

167
00:06:04,947 --> 00:06:06,491
- AND A DNA TEST.

168
00:06:06,491 --> 00:06:09,201
- I HEARD THE JURY'S 
STILL OUT ON SCIENCE.

169
00:06:09,201 --> 00:06:11,286
ANYWAY, HE WANTS 
TO GO TO THE FAIR.

170
00:06:11,286 --> 00:06:12,872
BUT I DON'T WANNA 
HURT HIS FEELINGS,

171
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:15,708
SO I NEED YOU TO DO IT.

172
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:18,544
JUST TELL HIM THAT I'M 
OUT OF TOWN ON ONE OF MY TRIPS.

173
00:06:18,544 --> 00:06:19,962
- I'M NOT GONNA LIE TO YOUR SON.

174
00:06:19,962 --> 00:06:22,381
- COME ON. 
I LIE TO YOURS ALL THE TIME.

175
00:06:22,381 --> 00:06:24,383
MICHAEL, I'M NOT READY 
TO BE A DAD.

176
00:06:24,383 --> 00:06:26,051
PLUS, I'M GONNA BE 
VERY BUSY THIS WEEK

177
00:06:26,051 --> 00:06:27,386
BEING A JUDGE 
FOR THE PAGEANT.

178
00:06:27,386 --> 00:06:29,972
narrator: GOB HAD BEEN 
A PAGEANT JUDGE FOR YEARS.

179
00:06:29,972 --> 00:06:31,932
- YOU CAN'T BELIEVE WHAT 
IT DOES FOR YOUR SEX LIFE.

180
00:06:31,932 --> 00:06:32,892
- I DON'T WANNA HEAR IT.

181
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:33,684
- I DON'T WANNA SAY IT.

182
00:06:33,684 --> 00:06:36,186
FIRST PLACE CHICK IS HOT 
BUT HAS AN ATTITUDE.

183
00:06:36,186 --> 00:06:37,855
DOESN'T DATE MAGICIANS.

184
00:06:37,855 --> 00:06:39,982
SECOND PLACE IS 
SOMEONE WEIRD USUALLY,

185
00:06:39,982 --> 00:06:41,984
LIKE A CHINESE GIRL 
OR A GEOLOGIST.

186
00:06:41,984 --> 00:06:43,819
BUT THIRD PLACE,

187
00:06:43,819 --> 00:06:46,447
ALTHOUGH A LITTLE BIT PLAIN, 
HAS SUPER LOW SELF-ESTEEM.

188
00:06:46,447 --> 00:06:52,202
SO I STEP IN AND, UH, LAY HER 
CROWN UPON MY SWEET HEAD.

189
00:06:52,202 --> 00:06:54,038
- HAVE I MISSED THIS EUPHEMISM?

190
00:06:54,038 --> 00:06:55,122
[knocking] 
- STEVE HOLT!

191
00:06:55,122 --> 00:06:57,792
- I SHOULD GO.

192
00:06:59,835 --> 00:07:02,379
- HE'S HIDING FROM ME, 
ISN'T HE?

193
00:07:02,379 --> 00:07:06,050
- YOU KNOW, YOU GOTTA STOP 
SAYING YOUR NAME ALL THE TIME.

194
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:08,177
- IT'S JUST THEY HAVE THIS 
FATHER-SON TRIATHLON,

195
00:07:08,177 --> 00:07:09,845
AND I JUST WANTED HIM 
TO DO IT WITH ME.

196
00:07:09,845 --> 00:07:11,722
- MMM. 
- STUPID, HUH?

197
00:07:11,722 --> 00:07:13,057
- THAT'S A PRETTY TOUGH RACE.

198
00:07:13,057 --> 00:07:15,976
- ONLY FOR A WIMP, A WUSS.

199
00:07:15,976 --> 00:07:16,977
A [bleep].

200
00:07:16,977 --> 00:07:19,522
narrator: 
AND STEVE DIDN'T MEAN PUSSYCAT.

201
00:07:19,522 --> 00:07:24,026
- UH, STEVE, HOW'D YOU LIKE 
TO DO THAT TRIATHLON WITH ME?

202
00:07:24,026 --> 00:07:25,570
- ARE YOU SERIOUS? 
- YEAH.

203
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:28,197
- UNCLE MIKE! 
- STEVE HOLT!

204
00:07:28,197 --> 00:07:30,991
narrator: BOTH MEN FELT GOOD 
ABOUT THEMSELVES.

205
00:07:30,991 --> 00:07:32,993
- UNCLE MIKE! 
- STEVE HOLT!

206
00:07:32,993 --> 00:07:36,581
narrator: BUT GOB DIDN'T SHARE 
THEIR ENTHUSIASM.

207
00:07:36,581 --> 00:07:38,290
- SO THIS IS HOW MICHAEL 
GETS RID OF MY SON--

208
00:07:38,290 --> 00:07:39,959
BY STEALING HIM.

209
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:42,419
WELL, I'LL JUST HAVE 
TO STEAL SOMETHING OF HIS,

210
00:07:42,419 --> 00:07:47,800
LIKE, SAY, HIS BICYCLE, 
AS A PLACEHOLDER.

211
00:07:53,305 --> 00:07:56,225
narrator: MICHAEL WAS TRYING 
TO PROVE HIS MANLINESS

212
00:07:56,225 --> 00:07:59,103
WITH STEVE HOLT.

213
00:07:59,103 --> 00:08:00,354
- RITA. HEY, IT'S MICHAEL.

214
00:08:00,354 --> 00:08:01,856
JUST WANTED TO LET YOU KNOW

215
00:08:01,856 --> 00:08:04,484
THAT I'M RUNNING 
A TRIATHLON AT THE FAIR,

216
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:07,152
AND IF YOU'RE BACK IN TOWN--

217
00:08:07,152 --> 00:08:09,113
OH, I CAN'T BELIEVE I CHOSE 
THIS MOMENT TO CALL YOU.

218
00:08:09,113 --> 00:08:12,241
narrator: MEANWHILE, 
AT THE CHURCH AND STATE FAIR,

219
00:08:12,241 --> 00:08:14,619
MAEBY WAS TRYING TO ENROLL 
IN THE PAGEANT...

220
00:08:14,619 --> 00:08:15,536
SORT OF.

221
00:08:15,536 --> 00:08:18,080
- YOUR SITUATION 
POSES A PROBLEM.

222
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,040
LET ME TALK TO OUR CHAIRMAN.

223
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:23,002
- HEY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING, 
MAEBY?

224
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:23,878
- IT'S SHIRLEY.

225
00:08:23,878 --> 00:08:25,004
I'M JUST HERE TO PROVE

226
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:27,548
THAT ALL THESE PAGEANTS 
CARE ABOUT IS LOOKS.

227
00:08:27,548 --> 00:08:28,591
JUST WATCH.

228
00:08:28,591 --> 00:08:30,676
SHIRLEY'S INNER BEAUTY WILL 
GET TRUMPED BY HER OUTER ICKY.

229
00:08:30,676 --> 00:08:33,220
- WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR NOSE? 
- IT'S PART OF THE DISGUISE.

230
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:34,263
ISN'T IT COOL?

231
00:08:34,263 --> 00:08:36,599
THE SAME ONE NICOLE KIDMAN 
WORE IN "THE HOURS."

232
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:38,058
- IT HAD BEEN PURCHASED FOR HER

233
00:08:38,058 --> 00:08:40,394
AT A CHARITY AUCTION SHE'D 
ATTENDED AS A STUDIO EXECUTIVE.

234
00:08:40,394 --> 00:08:42,563
- $10,000. 
- BY JAMIE KENNEDY.

235
00:08:42,563 --> 00:08:43,898
- YOU'RE SUCH A DEAR.

236
00:08:43,898 --> 00:08:46,108
BUT I'M NOT PUTTING YOU 
IN MY REMAKE

237
00:08:46,108 --> 00:08:49,111
OF "A THOROUGHLY POLITE DUSTUP."

238
00:08:49,111 --> 00:08:51,113
- MISS WOLFBEAK, 
ALTHOUGH IT COSTS QUITE A BIT

239
00:08:51,113 --> 00:08:55,159
TO PUT IN A RAMP FOR YOU, 
WE GOT APPROVAL.

240
00:08:55,159 --> 00:08:56,952
YOU'RE IN.

241
00:08:56,952 --> 00:08:59,288
narrator: AS MAEBY FOUND HERSELF 
STUCK IN A BEAUTY PAGEANT,

242
00:08:59,288 --> 00:09:02,166
LUCILLE WAS MEETING 
WITH ATTORNEY BOB LOBLAW

243
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:04,585
ABOUT GETTING HER SON 
OUT OF THE ARMY.

244
00:09:04,585 --> 00:09:07,171
- I MEAN, MY GOD. 
HE'S ALREADY LOST A HAND.

245
00:09:07,171 --> 00:09:08,297
IF HE LOSES A LEG,

246
00:09:08,297 --> 00:09:10,424
HOW WILL WE EVER 
GET HIM OUT OF THE APARTMENT?

247
00:09:10,424 --> 00:09:13,510
- WELL, THE ARMY DOES HAVE 
A "ONE IN, ONE OUT" PROGRAM,

248
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:15,262
WHERE THE INDUCTEE IS RELIEVED 
OF DUTY

249
00:09:15,262 --> 00:09:17,598
ONCE HE ENLISTS 
SOMEONE TO TAKE HIS PLACE.

250
00:09:17,598 --> 00:09:19,850
- SO I'M SUPPOSED TO FIND 
SOME POOR, INNOCENT SOUL

251
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:20,851
AND HOOK HIM?

252
00:09:20,851 --> 00:09:22,728
- WELL, THAT'S NOT 
GOING TO HELP SIGN ANYONE.

253
00:09:22,728 --> 00:09:23,854
WHERE'S YOUR HAND?

254
00:09:23,854 --> 00:09:25,940
- IT GOT STUCK 
IN THE PRIZE HOLE AGAIN.

255
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:29,359
- I TOLD YOU NOT TO PLAY 
THAT STUPID GAME ANYMORE.

256
00:09:29,359 --> 00:09:30,736
- OW. THERE GOES NUMBER THREE.

257
00:09:30,736 --> 00:09:34,615
I WASN'T PLAYING IT.

258
00:09:34,615 --> 00:09:36,659
I WAS JUST TRYING 
TO GET MY OTHER ONE BACK.

259
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:39,453
- HI. SORRY, SORRY. I TOTALLY 
FORGOT ABOUT THIS MEETING.

260
00:09:39,453 --> 00:09:40,621
WHAT'S GOING ON?

261
00:09:40,621 --> 00:09:42,790
- YOUR FATHER'S GOTTEN 
A LOT OF BAD PRESS

262
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:44,291
BECAUSE OF THE ESCAPE ATTEMPTS.

263
00:09:44,291 --> 00:09:45,585
VOLUNTEER FOR SOMETHING.

264
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:47,753
- I'LL DO ANYTHING TO GET OUT OF 
THIS [bleep] APARTMENT.

265
00:09:47,753 --> 00:09:49,504
- YOU'LL DO ANYTHING TO GET OUT 
OF [bleep]

266
00:09:49,504 --> 00:09:51,215
IN THIS APARTMENT.

267
00:09:51,215 --> 00:09:53,467
- AH, YOU'RE DRUNK. 
- YEAH, MOM, CAN YOU JUST--

268
00:09:53,467 --> 00:09:56,762
AND, DAD-- YOU KNOW, WHY DO WE 
EVEN NEED THE SURROGATE?

269
00:09:56,762 --> 00:09:58,138
YOU KNOW, DAD'S IN THE 
APARTMENT--

270
00:09:58,138 --> 00:09:59,724
- DON'T COME IN HERE. 
DON'T COME IN HERE.

271
00:09:59,724 --> 00:10:01,391
- DON'T COME IN HERE. 
I SAID NOT TO COME IN.

272
00:10:01,391 --> 00:10:03,686
- WOULD YOU GET OUT HERE PLEASE? 
- I'M WATCHING THE GAME.

273
00:10:03,686 --> 00:10:04,645
- I SAID NOT TO COME IN!

274
00:10:04,645 --> 00:10:07,815
- I DID NOT SPEND MONEY ON 
A SURROGATE SO YOU CAN JUST--

275
00:10:07,815 --> 00:10:09,650
- I LOST HIM.

276
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:11,235
- I THINK YOU'VE GOT 
YOUR HANDS FULL

277
00:10:11,235 --> 00:10:12,027
TRYING TO 
MAKE THIS GUY LOOK GOOD.

278
00:10:12,027 --> 00:10:14,739
- WELL, THERE'S A "STARTLED 
STRAIGHT" PROGRAM AT THE FAIR,

279
00:10:14,739 --> 00:10:17,532
WHICH INVOLVES YOU SPEAKING 
WITH AT-RISK MALE YOUTH,

280
00:10:17,532 --> 00:10:19,827
TO SCARE THEM AWAY 
FROM CRIMINAL BEHAVIOR.

281
00:10:19,827 --> 00:10:20,953
- OKAY. I CAN DO THAT.

282
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:23,664
I'M GONNA NEED SOME BIG, 
BLOWN-UP PHOTOS OF YOUR MOTHER.

283
00:10:23,664 --> 00:10:26,709
- I THINK THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT 
YOUR TIME IN PRISON, DAD.

284
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:28,753
- OH. OKAY. 
WHY NOT?

285
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:30,379
I MEAN, UH, 
IF I DON'T WIN THIS THING,

286
00:10:30,379 --> 00:10:31,505
I'M GONNA BE BACK THERE ANYWAY.

287
00:10:31,505 --> 00:10:35,175
- "AT RISK MALE YOUTH." 
THAT SPELLS "ARMY."

288
00:10:35,175 --> 00:10:38,053
narrator: AND THAT'S WHEN BUSTER 
DISCOVERED A RECRUITING POOL

289
00:10:38,053 --> 00:10:40,347
THE GOVERNMENT HAD BEEN 
FISHING FOR YEARS.

290
00:10:40,347 --> 00:10:41,598
- I MAY HEAD DOWN THERE TOO.

291
00:10:41,598 --> 00:10:43,684
- YEAH, I DON'T KNOW, DAD, 
"STARTLED STRAIGHT,"

292
00:10:43,684 --> 00:10:45,185
NOT SO SURE 
YOU'RE THE GUY FOR THAT.

293
00:10:45,185 --> 00:10:46,311
BUT I'LL LOOK INTO IT

294
00:10:46,311 --> 00:10:48,689
WHILE I'M DOWN AT THE FAIR 
SIGNING UP FOR A TRIATHLON.

295
00:10:48,689 --> 00:10:51,025
- TRIATHLON? DO YOU KNOW HOW 
HARD A TRIATHLON IS?

296
00:10:51,025 --> 00:10:53,027
PEOPLE LOSE CONTROL 
OF EVERY BODILY FUNCTION.

297
00:10:53,027 --> 00:10:55,696
DIDN'T YOU EVER SEE THAT VIDEO?

298
00:10:55,696 --> 00:10:59,158
IT'S LIKE YOUR MOTHER 
ON NEW YEAR'S EVE.

299
00:10:59,158 --> 00:11:01,618
narrator: ACTUALLY, LUCILLE 
WENT DOWN FASTER.

300
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:05,122
- YOU'RE NOT EVEN IN SHAPE.

301
00:11:05,122 --> 00:11:07,833
YOU'RE GONNA FALL APART 
IN FRONT OF EVERYBODY.

302
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:09,043
- YOU'RE KIND OF 
SCARING ME, DAD.

303
00:11:09,043 --> 00:11:10,085
- YOU SEE?

304
00:11:10,085 --> 00:11:11,879
PERFECT FOR THIS 
"STARTLED STRAIGHT" THING.

305
00:11:13,714 --> 00:11:15,299
narrator: 
TOBIAS WAS GETTING ANN READY

306
00:11:15,299 --> 00:11:17,384
FOR THE TALENT PORTION 
OF THE PAGEANT.

307
00:11:17,384 --> 00:11:18,385
- I THINK WE NEED SOMETHING

308
00:11:18,385 --> 00:11:20,679
WITH A LITTLE MORE SPECTACLE 
IN THE ACT.

309
00:11:20,679 --> 00:11:23,140
SOMETHING THAT WILL MAKE YOU 
LOOK SMALL AND PRETTY

310
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:25,600
IN COMPARISON: 
A CAMEL.

311
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:28,228
- YOU KNOW, SHE HAS 
A REALLY LOVELY SINGING VOICE.

312
00:11:28,228 --> 00:11:29,688
- I'LL SING TO THE CAMEL.

313
00:11:29,688 --> 00:11:31,606
- YES. WE CAN GOOGLE 
SOME DISCO SONGS

314
00:11:31,606 --> 00:11:32,858
WITH THE WORD "HUMP" IN THEM.

315
00:11:32,858 --> 00:11:33,943
- CUTE.

316
00:11:33,943 --> 00:11:35,319
- NO, THAT SOUNDS A BIT RACY.

317
00:11:35,319 --> 00:11:36,695
- OKAY. HE MAY BE AFRAID OF SEX,

318
00:11:36,695 --> 00:11:38,781
BUT YOU'RE NOT GOING 
TO WIN WITHOUT IT.

319
00:11:38,781 --> 00:11:39,824
- NO, I'M NOT AFRAID OF SEX.

320
00:11:39,824 --> 00:11:42,117
- OH, GOOD, HAVE SEX 
WITH THIS GIRL RIGHT NOW.

321
00:11:42,117 --> 00:11:44,036
DO IT. GO.

322
00:11:44,036 --> 00:11:47,456
GET IN THERE, HAVE SOME SEX 
WITH HER RIGHT NOW.

323
00:11:47,456 --> 00:11:48,874
I DIDN'T THINK SO.

324
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:53,420
ANN, YOU NEED TO DECIDE WHETHER 
YOU WANT A MAN OR A BOY.

325
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:55,547
I KNOW HOW I'D ANSWER.

326
00:11:55,547 --> 00:11:58,008
- GIVE US SOME ROOM, 
GEORGE MICHAEL.

327
00:11:58,008 --> 00:11:59,093
I CAN'T BREATHE.

328
00:11:59,093 --> 00:12:01,220
- OKAY, NOW YOU'RE 
UPSETTING THE TALENT. OUT!

329
00:12:02,596 --> 00:12:06,934

TO KEEP FROM HUMILIATING HIMSELF 
IN FRONT OF RITA.

333
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:16,235
- DON'T ASK, "CAN I?" 
ASK, "I CAN!"

00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:18,070
YOU CAN CONTROL YOUR BLADDER

351
00:12:55,232 --> 00:12:58,277
- I MEAN, I'VE ALREADY-- 
I PROMISED STEVE HOLT.

352
00:12:58,277 --> 00:12:59,987
YOU KNOW, HE'S OLDER. 
IT'S MORE MANLY.

353
00:12:59,987 --> 00:13:01,822
- YOU DON'T THINK I'M MANLY?

354
00:13:01,822 --> 00:13:04,616
- NO, NO, IT'S JUST, UH--

355

372
00:14:08,931 --> 00:14:11,183

I'M IN A LOT OF PAIN HERE.

373
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:13,435

00:14:13,435 --> 00:14:14,728
SO, UH, COACH GAVE ME THESE.

381
00:14:24,738 --> 00:14:26,740
AND HE WAS DESPERATE

MEANWHILE, MAEBY WAS TRYING TO 
GET KNOCKED OUT OF THE PAGEANT.

383
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:31,578

384
00:14:31,578 --> 00:14:34,581
HOW HAS GOD 
INFLUENCED YOUR LIFE?

385
00:14:34,581 --> 00:14:37,960
- ABOUT JUST AS MUCH AS BIG BIRD 
AND THE KEEBLER ELVES.

386
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,669

WOULD HAVE BEEN SHAKEN

387
00:14:39,669 --> 00:14:43,423
IF HE HAD TAKEN MY LEGS TOO.

388
00:14:43,423 --> 00:14:46,927

389
00:14:46,927 --> 00:14:50,430
I WAS BETRAYED 
BY MY BROTHER MICHAEL.

390
00:14:50,430 --> 00:14:52,724
WHO'S YOUR FAVORITE 
FAMILY MEMBER AND WHY?

391
00:14:52,724 --> 00:14:54,935
- DEFINITELY NOT MY SHALLOW, 
MATERIALISTIC MOTHER,

392
00:14:54,935 --> 00:14:56,853
WHO ONLY CARES ABOUT LOOKS.

393
00:14:56,853 --> 00:14:58,813
- I THINK WE ALL FEEL 
THAT WAY ABOUT OUR MOTHERS.

394
00:14:58,813 --> 00:15:00,774
AND WE ALL HAVE LEGS.

395

409
00:15:36,351 --> 00:15:38,687
YOU DON'T--YOU DON'T SEE HIM.

410
00:15:38,687 --> 00:15:41,356
IT NEVER STOPS, GUYS,

411
00:15:41,356 --> 00:15:43,567
AND EVERYBODY ACTS LIKE 
IT'S NO BIG DEAL.

412
00:15:43,567 --> 00:15:46,320

narrator: IT BECAME CLEAR THAT 
SHIRLEY WAS GOING TO WIN.

419
00:16:04,338 --> 00:16:06,256

THIS IS WRONG.

420
00:16:06,256 --> 00:16:07,549

421
00:16:07,549 --> 00:16:09,801

427
00:16:18,727 --> 00:16:19,603

429
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:22,982

FIVE INFLATABLE POOLS,

434
00:16:33,367 --> 00:16:34,534

435
00:16:34,534 --> 00:16:36,745
narrator: AND FATHERS AND SONS 
BEING MANACLED TOGETHER.

436
00:16:36,745 --> 00:16:38,080

437
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:40,040
DID THAT OXY-INCONTINENT 
SET IN YET?

438
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:42,376
- YOU KNEW THIS IS WHAT 
THE RACE WAS?

439
00:16:42,376 --> 00:16:44,211
- KIND OF. I MEAN, 
THEY CHANGE IT EVERY YEAR

440
00:16:44,211 --> 00:16:46,255
SO YOU CAN'T 
REPLICATE IT ON YOUR LAWN.

441
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:48,590
- WHY DID YOU LET ME 
TRAIN SO HARD?

442
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:50,842
- I JUST THOUGHT YOU WANTED 
TO HANG OUT AND DO GUY STUFF.

443
00:16:50,842 --> 00:16:52,094
- THIS ISN'T GUY STUFF.

444
00:16:52,094 --> 00:16:55,430

THAT YOU'D WANNA DO THIS.

445
00:16:55,430 --> 00:16:56,473
THIS IS STUPID, HUH?

446
00:16:56,473 --> 00:16:59,434

448
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:02,021

449
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:04,231
BUT, YOU KNOW, RITA'S NOT

THAT'S AMAZING.

458
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:19,163
AND I HEARD YOU'RE THE FIRST 
CAMEL ACT

459
00:17:19,163 --> 00:17:21,873
TO EVER CRACK THE TOP 10 TOO, 
SO THAT'S, LIKE, A RECORD.

460
00:17:21,873 --> 00:17:25,210
AND I'M A BIT RELIEVED, 
BECAUSE, UM, I WAS--

461
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:26,795
I THOUGHT MAYBE 
IF YOU CAME IN FIRST,

462
00:17:26,795 --> 00:17:28,380
YOU WOULD HAVE OUTGROWN ME.

463
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:30,840
- OUTGROWN YOU. 
- MM-HMM.

464
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:32,717

I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR.

IT SEEMS GOB WAS RIGHT

466
00:17:34,678 --> 00:17:37,389
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS 
TO THIRD PLACE CONTESTANTS.

467
00:17:37,389 --> 00:17:39,015
- I MET A MAN.

468
00:17:39,015 --> 00:17:41,476
narrator: 
GEORGE MICHAEL WAS DEVASTATED.

469
00:17:41,476 --> 00:17:43,312
IT SEEMED HE'D LOST 
HIS GIRL AND HIS FATHER

470
00:17:43,312 --> 00:17:46,315
BECAUSE HE WASN'T MAN ENOUGH.

471
00:17:46,315 --> 00:17:47,691
AND HE WAS FACED WITH A CHOICE.

472
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:05,584
MICHAEL AND STEVE HOLT

473
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:09,504
FINISHED THEIR TRIATHLON 
IN FIRST PLACE.

474
00:18:09,504 --> 00:18:11,506
OF COURSE, THEY WERE WAY OLDER.

475
00:18:11,506 --> 00:18:13,717
- BELIEVE IT OR NOT, THAT TOOK 
ABOUT EVERYTHING I GOT.

476
00:18:13,717 --> 00:18:15,051
I DON'T KNOW 
WHAT WAS IN THAT PILL,

477
00:18:15,051 --> 00:18:16,010
BUT I DO NOT FEEL SO GREAT.

478
00:18:16,010 --> 00:18:18,054
- IT'S GONNA GET A LITTLE WORSE 
BEFORE IT GETS ANY BETTER.

479
00:18:18,054 --> 00:18:18,347
- REALLY?

480
00:18:18,347 --> 00:18:19,764
- WE WON! 
- OKAY.

481
00:18:19,764 --> 00:18:21,225

482
00:18:21,225 --> 00:18:23,017

SIGNING UP FOR THE ARMY.

483
00:18:23,017 --> 00:18:24,478
- WHAT? YOU SIGNED HIM UP 
FOR THE ARMY?

484
00:18:24,478 --> 00:18:26,896
- OH, MY GOD, YOU'RE RIGHT. 
IF HE GOES IN, I CAN GET OUT.

485
00:18:26,896 --> 00:18:28,273
I'VE GOTTA GET MY NAME 
ON HIS FORM.

486
00:18:28,273 --> 00:18:29,441

487
00:18:29,441 --> 00:18:31,985
I GOTTA GET THERE. 
I GOTTA STOP THIS.

488
00:18:31,985 --> 00:18:34,279
HEY, YOU GOTTA DO THIS WITH ME.

RITA NOTICED MICHAEL.

490
00:18:37,199 --> 00:18:39,784

491
00:18:39,784 --> 00:18:41,745

492
00:18:41,745 --> 00:18:44,831

493
00:18:44,831 --> 00:18:45,957
FIRST PLACE, I SWEAR.
