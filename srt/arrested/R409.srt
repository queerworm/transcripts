You're hopelessly hopeless, Buster.

16

It's as if they wrote that song

17
00:00:49,215 --> 00:00:50,050
Huh?

18
00:00:51,134 --> 00:00:53,261
Fine! I got my own family now.

19

I've never met anyone

119
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:42,991
Or at all.

120
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:45,743

Please, someone.

00:06:37,563 --> 00:06:38,398
I hope you read this.

[narrator] <i>She did offer him a lifeline</i>

169
00:06:43,528 --> 00:06:44,987
<i>which he misread...</i>

170
00:06:45,113 --> 00:06:47,490
I'm ready to let the son of Gob
enfold me.

171
00:06:47,573 --> 00:06:49,826
[narrator] <i>Hoping to get some cash out</i>

172
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:53,704
Have you been to the club "And" owned
by Jeremy Piven?

173
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:55,123
I'm gonna be there tonight
about eight,

174
00:06:55,206 --> 00:06:57,125
maybe you could join me.

175
00:06:57,208 --> 00:06:59,460
-Obviously, it's me your fa--
-[beeps]

176
00:07:02,505 --> 00:07:03,339
I got it.

177
00:07:03,464 --> 00:07:04,298
Okay.

178
00:07:04,382 --> 00:07:05,633
[narrator] <i>But the prayers made</i>

179
00:07:05,716 --> 00:07:08,094

180

<i>...were soon answered.</i>

181
00:07:10,179 --> 00:07:11,848
Makeup makes everyone
feel a little better.

182
00:07:11,973 --> 00:07:14,892
You didn't leave me. Everybody leaves me.

183
00:07:15,017 --> 00:07:16,561
I wouldn't dream of it.

184
00:07:16,644 --> 00:07:19,272
Excuse me, could you leave us?

185
00:07:19,355 --> 00:07:20,356
-Absolutely.
-Thank you.

186
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,984
No, I'd like him to stay.

187
00:07:23,067 --> 00:07:23,943
Really?

188
00:07:24,026 --> 00:07:25,027
-Yeah.
-Okay.

189
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:28,030
I'm afraid that you have tested positive
for chlamydia, syphilis,

190
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:31,033
gonorrhea, hepatitis, pancreatitis,
trichomoniasis,

191
00:07:31,242 --> 00:07:32,743
non-gonococcal urethritis.

192
00:07:33,161 --> 00:07:34,537
all the "itis-es," really.

193
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:37,039
And there's also a host of "osis-es."

194
00:07:37,373 --> 00:07:39,208
You know, what this means,
in non-medical terms,

195
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:41,627
is that you have landed a real party girl.

196
00:07:43,254 --> 00:07:44,881
[Tobias] Will she be okay?

197
00:07:44,964 --> 00:07:48,009
We can treat all of these things,
but if she's really gonna be okay...

198
00:07:48,384 --> 00:07:50,303
she's going to have to tackle
this drug problem.

199
00:07:51,053 --> 00:07:52,430
You didn't tell me you had a drug problem.

200
00:07:52,513 --> 00:07:54,515
We met at a methadone clinic.

201
00:07:54,682 --> 00:07:56,726
Are you high, we met at an acting class.

202
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:58,269
The Method One...

203
00:07:59,395 --> 00:08:01,355
I'm going to let you guys hash this out.

204
00:08:01,647 --> 00:08:03,608
I guess I shouldn't have lied
about being clean

205
00:08:03,691 --> 00:08:04,942
when I took that methadone,

206
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:06,569
but I'll do better this time.

207
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:08,446
Are you going to leave me
now that you know

208
00:08:08,529 --> 00:08:10,031
that I'm a druggie?

209
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:13,576
DeBrie look, you are a gifted actress.

210
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:15,453
When I first saw <i>Straight Bait,</i>

211
00:08:15,536 --> 00:08:18,873
there were two men making love,
but I couldn't take my eyes off of you.

212
00:08:18,956 --> 00:08:20,291
You watched <i>Straight Bait?</i>

213
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:21,751
Oh just 2, 4 and 9.

214
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:24,504
You were with a guy
who didn't care about you,

215
00:08:24,795 --> 00:08:27,548
but stick with me,
and I'll make you famous,

216
00:08:27,715 --> 00:08:29,217
then you won't need any drugs.

217
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:31,427
Well, you're a doctor,

218
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:33,596
you could get me signed out of here.

219
00:08:34,722 --> 00:08:36,432
So I can pursue my dream of acting?

220
00:08:39,477 --> 00:08:40,520
Of course I can.

221
00:08:40,603 --> 00:08:43,606
[narrator] <i>But while Tobias was trying</i>
<i>to sneak out of a hospital,</i>

222
00:08:44,398 --> 00:08:46,901
<i>Buster was determined not to leave his.</i>

223
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:48,903
Ah! I blew it again.

224
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:50,404
I'll never do it right.

225
00:08:50,488 --> 00:08:54,450
[narrator] <i>And the Army began to suspect</i>

Do you have any ice cream?

230
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:04,085
<i>Maybe it would work with ice cream.</i>

231
00:09:04,627 --> 00:09:05,628
Now he wants ice cream.

232
00:09:06,671 --> 00:09:07,755
He's using us.

233
00:09:07,838 --> 00:09:09,882
It might be time for the Q test.

234
00:09:09,966 --> 00:09:12,426
The Q test? What's a Q test?

235
00:09:12,843 --> 00:09:15,846
[narrator] <i>Gob was planning</i>

-It was like I hit--
-Rock bottom?

00:09:26,315 --> 00:09:27,149
No, not that.

242
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:29,777
More like a trending downward moment.

243
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:33,406
Maybe I'm being tested,
like that guy "Job" from the Bible.

244
00:09:33,489 --> 00:09:35,575
-Job. Job!
-Yes?

245
00:09:35,658 --> 00:09:36,492
Yes, sir.

00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:38,828
-Job.
-Yeah, that's me.

247
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:40,121
I feel sorry for you, Pops.

248
00:09:40,204 --> 00:09:42,206
Hey, pal.
I'm not that much older than you, guy.

[laughs]

Nah, I'm just here looking for my son,

You have another son?

252

I have a brother? Oh, man!

Yes... Steve.

But I don't... pest control. I don't know.

As long as I'm not being a pest to you,
right? I'm kidding.

Seven a.m.

279
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:54,862

[man] Why wouldn't be able to see us?

292

No, it's a window.

Great. The last thing I need is
to be seen partying with some tweens.

337

Dude, network's gonna flip
if there's another drunk photo of you.

338
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,155
-I know.
-We got to get you away from here.

339
00:13:43,239 --> 00:13:45,157
Getting away is kind of my specialty.

340
00:13:46,408 --> 00:13:48,327
I'll have us out of here in a flash.

341
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:53,499

358
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:38,711

Sue Storm.

360
00:14:40,296 --> 00:14:42,590
We're gonna do
the <i>Fantastic Four</i> movie.

361
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:45,259
Well, I don't know about just yet, but...

362
00:14:46,427 --> 00:14:48,262
DeBrie, if you make this leap with me,

363
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:51,724
I promise I'll have you splattered all
over Hollywood Boulevard.

364
00:14:52,516 --> 00:14:53,434
How does that sound?

365
00:14:54,101 --> 00:14:55,394
Confusing.

366
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:56,854
[narrator] <i>It was.</i>

367
00:14:57,187 --> 00:15:00,983
Get your photo taken with Sue Storm,
from the <i>Fantastic Four.</i>

368
00:15:01,191 --> 00:15:02,693
Is that Jessica Alba?

369
00:15:02,776 --> 00:15:04,320
No, this is the original Sue Storm,

370

-DeBrie Bardeaux
-Who?

371

374
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:14,747
I don't think this is working.

375
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:17,458
I need to get a regular job.

376
00:15:18,042 --> 00:15:19,627
I do have a law degree.

377
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:23,130
I know, and I'm a doctor,
but, no, let's not settle.

378
00:15:23,505 --> 00:15:25,341
It's the Fantastic Four.

379
00:15:25,466 --> 00:15:27,760
No one recognizes one alone.

380
00:15:28,719 --> 00:15:31,555
$10 gets you a picture

381
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:33,807
What do you say, $10?
That's certainly cheap.

382

Father.

385
00:15:39,813 --> 00:15:40,940
Oh, that's terrific.

386
00:15:41,023 --> 00:15:43,067
I'm Johnny Storm, the human flamer,

387
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:45,152
and this is Sue Storm, my sister

388
00:15:45,235 --> 00:15:46,946
and fellow fighter in law.

389
00:15:47,029 --> 00:15:48,322

390
00:15:48,405 --> 00:15:52,034
I have special effects.
Look, children love fire. [groans]

391
00:15:52,117 --> 00:15:53,661
This isn't working either.

392
00:15:53,744 --> 00:15:54,745
[sighs] You're right.

393

You know what, though.

395
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:01,502
I think I may have just the thing.

Now that I'm the iconic rock man

no one will misunderstand.

400
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:12,596
I'm sure the Blues Brothers here
will know who we are.

401
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:14,515
Excuse me, are you Sue Storm

402

<i>They were not The Blues Brothers.</i>

403

410

-I have a law degree.
-No, DeBrie, I've got this.

411
00:16:34,034 --> 00:16:35,411
Mr. Feinberg,

412

I have nowhere to live.

419
00:16:53,804 --> 00:16:56,306
You should have thought about that

420
00:16:57,224 --> 00:16:59,018
Oh, I'm sorry.
I have nowhere to go.

421
00:16:59,435 --> 00:17:02,146
I'm sorry, you're a veteran
and you have nowhere to go?

425
00:17:09,486 --> 00:17:10,738
It's not Army's fault.

426
00:17:10,821 --> 00:17:11,905
I'm a monster.

427
00:17:11,989 --> 00:17:14,158
And what makes you think
you're a monster?

428
00:17:14,241 --> 00:17:15,909
What do you see when you look at this?

429
00:17:17,995 --> 00:17:21,248
I see a veteran whose hand I'd like
to shake.

430
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:23,292
Not that one.

431
00:17:23,417 --> 00:17:25,627

Perfect.
Wait, you didn't say "nothing," did you?

-Something.
-Something.<i> </i>Got it.

Can they really make us leave
Hollywood Boulevard?

00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:44,646
Apparently in this instance,
paper beats rock.

439

You have rock?

440
00:17:46,023 --> 00:17:48,025
No, I am your rock now.

441
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,570
Oh. So what are we gonna do now
that we don't have the rights?

442
00:17:52,446 --> 00:17:54,198
We'll just go off brand.

443

If it happens again,
it will be a third strike.

The three strikes law is up for review
