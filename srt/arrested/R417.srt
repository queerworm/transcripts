165
00:06:48,574 --> 00:06:50,493
[narrator] <i>But she wasn't the only Bluth</i>

166
00:06:50,576 --> 00:06:53,204
<i>pretending to be something</i>
<i>they weren't that night.</i>

167
00:06:53,329 --> 00:06:54,497
Who's the cheap redhead?

168
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:01,129
Well, hello.

169
00:07:01,212 --> 00:07:04,090
Hello... indeed.

170
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:06,843
Look at you. What are you doing here?

171
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:08,803
I need the membership.
I'm taking my boss out to dinner.

172
00:07:08,886 --> 00:07:10,680
It's too late. I already made a deal
with Dad for it.

173
00:07:10,763 --> 00:07:12,723
[narrator]
<i>When George Sr. made it a condition</i>

174
00:07:12,807 --> 00:07:14,475
<i>of giving Michael his movie rights.</i>

175
00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:16,310
Can you help me, then, with Love?

176
00:07:16,394 --> 00:07:17,687
Of course I will.

177
00:07:20,731 --> 00:07:22,108
If you do something for me.

178
00:07:23,317 --> 00:07:25,611
I would like to use your membership
at the Balboa Club.

179
00:07:26,529 --> 00:07:27,822
The girl I've been telling you about,

180
00:07:27,905 --> 00:07:30,825
she likes nice things,
and if everything goes well tonight,

181
00:07:30,908 --> 00:07:32,952
I think I may want
to take her out for a nice dinner.

182
00:07:33,077 --> 00:07:34,579
You really like this girl?

183
00:07:35,204 --> 00:07:37,248
-[sighs] She's Tracey.
-Oh!

184
00:07:37,832 --> 00:07:40,001
Fat Tracey or thin Tracey
at the end?

185
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:43,004
I think, just on this,
you owe me the membership.

186
00:07:43,171 --> 00:07:46,966
We're kind of maxed out at the club,
but if you show them my card,

187
00:07:47,049 --> 00:07:48,968
I'm sure they won't turn you away
at the door.

188
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:52,346
You'd do this for me?

189
00:07:53,681 --> 00:07:54,515
I will if you...

190
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:56,809
This is why I had to ask you for the in
with Herbert Love.

191
00:07:56,893 --> 00:07:59,645
Exactly, and that's why
you are leaving, and I'm going to stay

192
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:00,813
because I'm the one
who did the favor.

193
00:08:00,897 --> 00:08:01,856
I got Love against the wall.

194
00:08:01,939 --> 00:08:03,065
Plus I've got to impress him.

195
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:04,567
He's making me part of his campaign.

196
00:08:04,942 --> 00:08:06,777
I'm sorry, there seems
to have been a mix-up.

197
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:09,363
A merry one. A merry one.

198
00:08:09,447 --> 00:08:11,699
I haven't been on a date
in a very long time.

199
00:08:11,782 --> 00:08:14,160
and she's going out with Ron Howard,
so I need to impress her.

200
00:08:14,243 --> 00:08:17,955
[narrator] <i>Actually, she was his daughter,</i>
<i>but Michael still didn't know that.</i>

201
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:19,749
Great to see you.
And you look so good.

202
00:08:19,832 --> 00:08:20,875
So do you.

203
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:22,502
I need to impress him too,

204
00:08:22,585 --> 00:08:23,419
because I finally found someone

205
00:08:23,753 --> 00:08:25,671
-who respects me for who I am.
-So does mine.

206
00:08:25,755 --> 00:08:27,381
Listen, we'll share it, okay?

207
00:08:27,548 --> 00:08:28,591
Got it? Great.

208
00:08:28,841 --> 00:08:30,676
My name is Cindy Featherbottom.

209
00:08:31,552 --> 00:08:33,304
I used to be a real estate tycoon,

210
00:08:33,387 --> 00:08:35,139
now I'm an impressive producer. Got it?

211
00:08:35,223 --> 00:08:36,140
-Got it.
-Eat light.

212
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:39,101
This is my date. This is Rebel Alley.

213
00:08:39,227 --> 00:08:40,895
And my boss Herbert Love.

214
00:08:40,978 --> 00:08:43,064
-High-low.
-High-low...

215
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:45,066
Just like your plan to hurt the poor.

216
00:08:45,149 --> 00:08:47,318
I thought it was
about neglecting the poor.

217
00:08:47,401 --> 00:08:49,695
I guess the special tonight
is red snapper.

218
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:51,781
How do you know this woman?

219
00:08:53,616 --> 00:08:56,661
She is... um...

220
00:09:00,748 --> 00:09:01,707
Look at you!

221
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:03,167
-High school.
-Brother and sister.

222
00:09:03,251 --> 00:09:05,461
We can't be brother-sister.
She knows about the family.

223
00:09:05,586 --> 00:09:06,921
-We don't.
-Just met.

224
00:09:07,004 --> 00:09:08,172
So let's eat.

225
00:09:08,422 --> 00:09:10,591
[narrator]
<i>And that's how Lindsay found herself</i>

226
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:13,594
<i>on a very awkward double date</i>
<i>with her brother.</i>

227
00:09:13,803 --> 00:09:16,681
Is everybody's food
as delicious as my side salad?

228
00:09:16,764 --> 00:09:18,933
[narrator] <i>And a couple of glasses</i>
<i>of white wine in,</i>

229
00:09:19,016 --> 00:09:21,686
<i>Rebel started to espouse</i>
<i>her liberal agenda.</i>

230
00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:23,938
It's just a little hard to sit
two feet away from someone

231
00:09:24,021 --> 00:09:26,482
who doesn't believe in paying
for a woman's contraception.

232
00:09:26,732 --> 00:09:29,360
Well, to be fair,
he does pay for the room.

233
00:09:29,443 --> 00:09:33,239
Is there anything better
than the great American scallop?

234
00:09:33,364 --> 00:09:34,198
Look how he changes the subject.

235
00:09:34,323 --> 00:09:36,659
Aren't you glad your teenager's
not here to see this?

236
00:09:36,784 --> 00:09:37,743
You have a teenager?

237
00:09:39,203 --> 00:09:40,496
I'm a movie...

238
00:09:40,621 --> 00:09:42,290
Movie producer.

239
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:43,624
Producing a movie right now.

240
00:09:43,749 --> 00:09:46,252
Rebel's in it, for Imagine Entertainment.

241
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:48,963
Oh. Is that Ron Howard's company?

242
00:09:49,046 --> 00:09:50,047
-Yeah.
-Yes.

243
00:09:50,214 --> 00:09:53,009
I don't want to be the one to say it,
but I hate that guy.

244
00:09:53,217 --> 00:09:55,761
He's just another
Hollywood liberal big shot.

245
00:09:56,887 --> 00:09:58,764
There are a lot of
those Ron Howards out there

246
00:09:58,848 --> 00:10:00,182
that do abuse their power,

247
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:02,351
but I will tell you, sir,
that I do not do that.

248
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:06,105
Don't you have to have power
to abuse the power?

249
00:10:06,522 --> 00:10:09,859
I am not going to sit here
and defend Ron Howard

250
00:10:10,026 --> 00:10:12,486
to someone who's never achieved half
of what he's achieved.

251
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:14,280
Are you saying that to him or me?

252
00:10:14,363 --> 00:10:16,907
I forgot how touchy
these Hollywood people can be.

253
00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:19,619
I'm not. Are you saying that I am?

254
00:10:19,744 --> 00:10:21,579
Maybe Ron Howard is,
but I mean, I don't know.

255
00:10:21,704 --> 00:10:25,625
But I'm not. And I am also not one
of those Beverly Hills billionaires

256
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:27,710
who can't go two minutes without putting
his phone to his--

257
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:30,046
I got to take this.
Hold on one second. Hello.

258
00:10:31,422 --> 00:10:34,091
Hey, George Michael.
You stuck in traffic, pal?

259
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:36,719
I just feel terrible that we couldn't
get together the other night,

260
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:39,555
and I miss you,
but I'm free all night if--

261
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:42,892
Listen, I'm in the middle
of a film meeting...

262
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:44,226
<i>It's a producer thing.</i>

263
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:46,979
People in politics involved, and I just...

264
00:10:47,063 --> 00:10:49,565
I can't get away this time.

265
00:10:49,732 --> 00:10:53,194
[narrator] <i>It seemed the two men were</i>
<i>growing less alike every day.</i>

266
00:10:54,445 --> 00:10:55,738
<i>And back at the table...</i>

267
00:10:55,821 --> 00:10:57,573
<i>Lindsay found herself torn,</i>

268
00:10:57,657 --> 00:11:01,077
<i>between who she was with</i>
<i>and who she wanted to be.</i>

269
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,244
But what do I know?

270
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:04,330
-I'm just shallow, Hollywood--
-[cell phone rings]

271
00:11:04,705 --> 00:11:06,290
God, I've got to get this.

272
00:11:06,457 --> 00:11:07,375
It could be my agent.

273
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:10,002
Hello?

274
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:12,129
Hi, Rebel, it's George Maharis.

275
00:11:12,421 --> 00:11:13,923
<i>My night just freed up,</i>

276
00:11:14,006 --> 00:11:15,257
<i>and I was wondering if you wanted...</i>

277
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:16,926
I thought you were having dinner
with your dad.

278
00:11:17,134 --> 00:11:18,177
<i>You know, older guy,</i>

279
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:19,553
<i>the night ends for them at eight.</i>

280
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,889
<i>I think I could use a break</i>
<i>from the old guys.</i>

281
00:11:22,056 --> 00:11:23,766
<i>And I've already</i>
<i>got some birth control in me</i>

282
00:11:23,849 --> 00:11:25,267
<i>that I paid for myself,</i>

283
00:11:25,393 --> 00:11:26,977
<i>and I'd hate to let it go to waste.</i>

284
00:11:27,061 --> 00:11:29,939
That's perfect, because
I'm not quite ready to have children.

285
00:11:31,565 --> 00:11:35,444
That is one redhead I do not
want to have sexual relations with.

286
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:36,570
[laughing]

287
00:11:36,654 --> 00:11:37,613
Well...

288
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:39,448
So, are we having dessert?

289
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:40,783
-No.
-No.

290
00:11:41,075 --> 00:11:42,702
Well, I don't want to be
the one to say it,

291
00:11:42,785 --> 00:11:46,664
but if we are not going to have dessert,
then I think I am going to leave.

292
00:11:46,747 --> 00:11:47,707
No.

293
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:50,710
But we're gonna discuss
those new positions tonight.

294
00:11:50,793 --> 00:11:52,294
Wasn't that the plan?

295
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:54,422
I think the best position
for me to be in tonight

296
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:56,298
is with my wife,

297
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:58,509
and tomorrow I'm taking
my wife and children

298
00:11:58,759 --> 00:12:01,220
to see the beautiful
American ocean.

299
00:12:01,303 --> 00:12:02,555
[crowd applauding]

300
00:12:02,638 --> 00:12:05,516
-Hey.
-Hey. I have to go.

301
00:12:06,434 --> 00:12:08,394
-My son is sick, so...
-Oh, no.

302
00:12:08,477 --> 00:12:09,520
I have to go.

303
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:12,398
Rebel. Rebel, let me come.

304
00:12:12,481 --> 00:12:13,607
I'm great with kids.

305
00:12:13,691 --> 00:12:15,860
It's not about the kid.
I'm not comfortable here.

306
00:12:15,985 --> 00:12:17,945
Okay. Are you off to see him?

307
00:12:18,028 --> 00:12:19,447
Listen, if you've got a problem
with me seeing other people,

308
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:20,740
why don't you just come out and say it?

309
00:12:20,823 --> 00:12:23,284
No, I can. What do you mean?
I can handle that.

310
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:24,994
We'll see each other a la carte.

311
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:28,164
Like the $18 baked potato you ordered
that you didn't touch.

312
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:30,040
Yeah, you're not comfortable.

313
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:32,376
No,  listen. Rebel, Rebel.

314
00:12:32,501 --> 00:12:33,502
Fine. See you later.

315
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:34,962
Say hi to Ron Howard for me.

316
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:38,466
Well, hope you're happy.
My girlfriend left,

317
00:12:38,549 --> 00:12:41,427
because she can't stand your right-wing,
American scallop eating boyfriend.

318
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:45,639
He left because your chirpy little actress
couldn't keep her mouth shut.

319
00:12:45,723 --> 00:12:48,184
-That's it. You're out of the movie.
-Fine.

320
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:49,894
[narrator]
<i>And with his evening freed up,</i>

321
00:12:49,977 --> 00:12:53,355
<i>Michael reached out to a son</i>
<i>he'd earlier blown off.</i>

322
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:56,609
-Hey, Dad.
-George Michael, hey.

323
00:12:56,692 --> 00:12:57,693
I got out of it.

324
00:12:57,777 --> 00:12:59,820
I made a ton of people angry,

325
00:12:59,904 --> 00:13:01,447
but you know what I always say,

326
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:02,364
"Family..."

327
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:04,241
Well, gosh, you know,
I really wanted to do that,

328
00:13:04,325 --> 00:13:07,661
but I had this work thing come up.

329
00:13:07,745 --> 00:13:09,288
And it's like you always say,

330
00:13:09,413 --> 00:13:11,665
"Family first,
unless there's a work thing.

331
00:13:11,832 --> 00:13:13,167
And then, work first."

332
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:15,503
-I have said that, too.
<i>-Yeah.</i>

333
00:13:15,586 --> 00:13:17,296
So...

334
00:13:18,547 --> 00:13:21,884
I've got politics and producing stuff
I can...

335
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:23,803
Yeah, we'll do it soon.

336
00:13:24,345 --> 00:13:25,429
-All right
<i>-All right, great.</i>

337
00:13:25,596 --> 00:13:27,181
<i>-That'll be perfect. Bye-bye.</i>
-Another time.

338
00:13:29,517 --> 00:13:30,768
[knock on door]

339
00:13:30,935 --> 00:13:32,853
-Hey.
-Hi.

340
00:13:32,937 --> 00:13:35,689
-Oh, so this is a dorm.
-This is a dorm.

341
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:38,859
Well, I suppose
anything goes in a dorm.

342
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:40,152
You got that right.

343
00:13:40,277 --> 00:13:43,572
[narrator] <i>And while George Michael's</i>
<i>night would soon get better...</i>

344
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:44,990
We should probably go inside,

345
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:47,159
because they don't like us
hanging out in the hallways actually.

346
00:13:47,243 --> 00:13:48,118
Yeah.

347
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:54,083
[narrator] <i>Michael's would only get worse.</i>

348
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:55,709
-Hi.
-It's Michael Bluth.

349
00:13:55,793 --> 00:13:56,669
Who is this?

350
00:13:56,752 --> 00:13:58,879
This is my baby brother Argyle.

351
00:13:58,963 --> 00:14:00,506
And here's the family joke.

352
00:14:00,589 --> 00:14:03,884
I'm a tall drink of water,
and he's the chaser.

353
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:06,762
[narrator]
<i>And the chaser wanted to be a producer.</i>

354
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:08,013
Here's another joke.

355
00:14:08,097 --> 00:14:11,767
You owe my sister $700,000,

356
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:13,644
and I'm going to chase you down
until you pay up.

357
00:14:13,727 --> 00:14:15,646
And if you don't pay up by the 4th,

358
00:14:15,729 --> 00:14:18,232
you're gonna be washing up
with the rest of the broken <i>piñatas</i>

359
00:14:18,315 --> 00:14:19,567
on the 5th.

360
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:21,861
-[woman] Lucille!
-Hello.

361
00:14:22,069 --> 00:14:24,864
Ow, ow!
What is on the bottom of those shoes?

362
00:14:24,947 --> 00:14:26,115
Taps.

363
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:30,369
And I can tap dance all over your face,
if you know what I mean.

364
00:14:30,452 --> 00:14:32,913
Even if my heart won't snap back
into place.

365
00:14:33,414 --> 00:14:35,332
I don't know what you meant
with the last part there.

366
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:37,835
I'll chase you down
and find you, Michael.

367
00:14:37,918 --> 00:14:40,504
You can't hide in
a gorilla suit from me.

368
00:14:43,674 --> 00:14:45,885
[narrator]
<i>But Argyle was wrong on that one...</i>

369
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:49,471
<i>It was Buster Bluth</i>
<i>who wore the gorilla suit.</i>

370
00:14:53,934 --> 00:14:56,604
<i>Tobias had no way of being around DeBrie</i>

371
00:14:56,687 --> 00:14:59,440

<i>And that's when he ran into</i>
<i>an equally worried Michael.</i>

373
00:15:04,236 --> 00:15:05,070
You okay?

374
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:08,115
Michael.<i> </i>What a pleasant surprise.

375
00:15:08,616 --> 00:15:11,201
Please. Make yourself at home.

376
00:15:11,285 --> 00:15:12,578
I am. I'm home.

377
00:15:12,661 --> 00:15:15,706
This is my-- I own all
the homes here, actually.

378
00:15:15,789 --> 00:15:17,499
And Gob's supposed to be
selling these, so...

379
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:19,001
Where is he? Do you know?

380
00:15:19,209 --> 00:15:20,127
Out and about.

381
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:22,379
Me doth think he hath a lady.

382
00:15:22,463 --> 00:15:24,798
-As doth I dooth.
-Oh.

383
00:15:24,882 --> 00:15:26,759
And they're both bit of a celebrities.

384
00:15:26,884 --> 00:15:30,179
Well, that is odd,
because I'm also dating a celebrity.

385
00:15:30,262 --> 00:15:32,181
Perchance a double date is in our future.

386
00:15:32,264 --> 00:15:34,016
-Eh, brother-in-law?
-I don't...

387
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:35,059
Tell me about her.

388
00:15:36,894 --> 00:15:39,271
I don't think that you're
the best one to talk to

389
00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:41,190
about my relationship difficulties.

390
00:15:41,565 --> 00:15:42,608
Fair enough.

391
00:15:42,983 --> 00:15:46,445
It's only what I do for a living, Michael.

392
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:49,531
What I'm trained to do.

393
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:53,827
Well, let me tell you
a little bit about her.

394
00:15:53,911 --> 00:15:55,412
{\an8}So, it's a simple choice, really.

395
00:15:55,496 --> 00:15:58,040
If I keep seeing her,
he'll find out and kill the movie.

396
00:15:58,123 --> 00:16:00,668
So, I either keep the girl
and lose the movie,

397
00:16:00,751 --> 00:16:03,379
or I keep the movie, lose the girl.

398
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:05,798
But the whole reason that I did the movie
was to get the girl.

399
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:11,178
[sighs]
Michael, I appreciate your bravery.

400
00:16:11,261 --> 00:16:13,097
And I know everything
seems doomed now,

401
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:15,849
and believe me,
I'm in a similar situation myself,

402
00:16:16,392 --> 00:16:17,726
but trust me.

403
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:23,482
We are [bleeps] We are [bleeps]
We're [bleeps]

404
00:16:23,565 --> 00:16:26,110
I mean, unless some sort of
miracle coincidence happens.

405
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:30,572
But, no, the best thing
to do is just walk away,

406
00:16:30,698 --> 00:16:33,117
and we'll lick each other's wombs.

407
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,786
I think I should just go tell Ron Howard
that it is over.

408
00:16:35,911 --> 00:16:36,870
Yes.

409
00:16:36,954 --> 00:16:39,748
-Ron Howard's making this movie?
-Yeah.

410
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:41,166
Michael, you can't just walk away
from this.

411
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:42,543
You have to go talk to him.

412
00:16:42,793 --> 00:16:43,711
How's this?

413
00:16:43,794 --> 00:16:46,171
What I'm going
to do for you, Michael, is...

414
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:49,925
I am going to go there
with you for moral support,

415
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:51,885
and I will act as your assistant

416
00:16:51,969 --> 00:16:54,930
and maybe I'll do
my famous gay character.

417
00:16:55,055 --> 00:16:56,640
I don't think you've
seen that character.

418
00:16:56,765 --> 00:16:57,975
I think I have.

419
00:16:58,934 --> 00:17:02,104
Hmm... I don't think so.

420
00:17:03,355 --> 00:17:05,482
[narrator]
<i>The next day Michael sat down</i>

421
00:17:05,566 --> 00:17:08,318
<i>for a one-on-one meeting with Ron Howard.</i>

422
00:17:08,402 --> 00:17:10,195
Hi, thank you for seeing me.

423
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:11,488
Well, that's fine,

424
00:17:11,572 --> 00:17:14,408
but I should warn you,
this is what I call a haircut meeting,

425
00:17:14,908 --> 00:17:16,869
-So, we probably don't have much time.
-Okay.

426
00:17:16,952 --> 00:17:19,038
It would be so much better
if we could just lose the baseball cap.

427
00:17:19,246 --> 00:17:20,205
We go through this every time.

428
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:21,957
This is a hat-on haircut,

429
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:23,792
so you just cut what they can see.

430
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:24,877
You got it, Floyd?

431
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:28,839
I call all my barbers Floyd.
It's just easier for me.

432
00:17:28,922 --> 00:17:30,466
Okay. I'm gonna make this quick.

433
00:17:30,674 --> 00:17:32,885
[clears throat]

434
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:35,554
Are you not going to introduce me?

435
00:17:35,929 --> 00:17:37,765
I thought you were gonn wait in the lobby.

436
00:17:38,348 --> 00:17:40,893
Tobias Funke.
I am a producer, as well.

437
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:44,146
But I'm also an actor.
That's probably what confused you.

438
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:46,356
I've done several inmate roles,

439
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,775
as well as a couple of

440
00:17:47,858 --> 00:17:50,486
"And As It Is Such,
So Also As Such Is It Unto You's,"

441
00:17:50,611 --> 00:17:52,905
but I'll get to you after.

442
00:17:52,988 --> 00:17:54,448
Well, that's terrific.

443
00:17:54,615 --> 00:17:56,116
Do you notice that he's already
on my neck hair?

444
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,410
Yes. Last time I was in here,
we talked about,

445
00:17:58,494 --> 00:18:00,621
I wouldn't come back until I had
all the release signatures.

446
00:18:00,704 --> 00:18:02,331
-I wanted to give you an update.
-Terrific.

447
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:04,291
You can just leave 'em
on Louisa's desk.

448
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:07,419
But that's the update.
I don't have them.

449
00:18:08,378 --> 00:18:09,213
Done.

450
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:12,091
Okay, well, thanks for coming.

451
00:18:12,174 --> 00:18:13,342
Well...

452
00:18:13,467 --> 00:18:15,344
Don't you have something else
you wanted to say?

453
00:18:15,469 --> 00:18:17,054
If not, I'll do mine.

454
00:18:17,137 --> 00:18:19,515
No, no, no. What? I don't--

455
00:18:20,015 --> 00:18:22,810
[exhales]
Ron, I care about someone deeply,

456
00:18:22,893 --> 00:18:25,813
and I think that you may also
care about this person.

457
00:18:25,896 --> 00:18:26,980
Hey, that's terrific.

458
00:18:28,524 --> 00:18:30,192
It's Rebel. Rebel Alley.

459
00:18:30,275 --> 00:18:32,986
And she thinks that you're
gonna always be in her life.

460
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:36,031
I'm glad to know she thinks that.

461
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:37,032
Yeah.

462
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:38,617
Tell him how you feel about her.

463
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:40,536
Yeah, you know, I'm crazy about her,

464
00:18:40,702 --> 00:18:43,247
and I'm not going to
be able to do anything about that

465
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:45,415
until you let her go.

466
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:48,168
-She's my little num-num.
-Sure.

467
00:18:48,293 --> 00:18:49,586
-You understand what I'm saying?
-Of course.

468
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:51,964
I've changed her. I've bathed her.

469
00:18:52,297 --> 00:18:53,841
Now you want to bathe her.

470
00:18:53,924 --> 00:18:55,634
Yeah, it's my time to bathe her.

471
00:18:56,426 --> 00:18:57,511
She should be my num-num,

472
00:18:57,594 --> 00:18:59,763
She should be my num-num,

473
00:18:59,847 --> 00:19:02,474
and you've got to just let her go,
I think, once and for all.

474
00:19:03,016 --> 00:19:06,395
A father doesn't really like to hear that
when it comes to his daughter.

475
00:19:06,478 --> 00:19:08,814
I haven't had a chance
to talk to her father.

476
00:19:08,939 --> 00:19:11,942
I have not yet had a chance
to talk to her father, but...

477
00:19:12,067 --> 00:19:14,486
No, no. I was saying that.

478
00:19:15,404 --> 00:19:17,531
Because you are talking to her father.

479
00:19:31,336 --> 00:19:33,589
Did you not know that I'm Rebel's dad?

480
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:36,884
I knew that part.

481
00:19:41,513 --> 00:19:42,806
But I also...

482
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:46,518
I thought that you might also be...

483
00:19:47,561 --> 00:19:48,604
her...

484
00:19:51,565 --> 00:19:53,442
Her lover?

485
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:55,944
No.

486
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:58,280
Well, this is hardly an episode
of<i> Happy Days.</i>

487
00:19:58,947 --> 00:20:01,533
I get it.
I was arrested as a sex offender,

488
00:20:01,825 --> 00:20:05,996
but at least I knew it was my daughter
I was arrested for coming on to.

489
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:08,790
Now, about my project,
it's a family piece.

490
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:10,250
Does this mean our project is dead?

491
00:20:10,334 --> 00:20:14,004
Listen, I never let personal matters
interfere with business.

492
00:20:14,087 --> 00:20:16,465
However, you should know
she's dating someone else,

493
00:20:16,548 --> 00:20:18,091
and I'll do everything in my power

494
00:20:18,175 --> 00:20:19,676
to make sure she never dates you again.

495
00:20:20,177 --> 00:20:21,428
Incredibly fair of you.

496
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:24,723
Well, that was a merry mix-up, eh?
[laughs]

497
00:20:25,307 --> 00:20:26,850
Now, about my project,

498
00:20:26,934 --> 00:20:29,353
it's based on something
that you produced in '92,

499
00:20:29,436 --> 00:20:30,938
<i>The Fantastic Four.</i>

500
00:20:31,021 --> 00:20:33,190
That was a favor that I did for Fox.

501
00:20:33,398 --> 00:20:37,027
It turns out that one of the leads,
DeBrie, played Sue Storm.

502
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:38,820
In fact, she is the leading lady

503
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:42,950
in my production of
<i>Fantastic Four: The Musical.</i>

504
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:46,036
Which, with a wave
of your little pink hand,

505
00:20:46,119 --> 00:20:47,412
you could make happen,

506
00:20:47,496 --> 00:20:48,872
and then I'd owe you one.

507
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:51,917
Thanks, but I couldn't do that.

508
00:20:52,042 --> 00:20:56,380
It would just be so incredibly meaningful
and change so many lives.

509
00:20:56,463 --> 00:20:57,422
I can't do it.

510
00:20:57,839 --> 00:21:01,593
But I also don't want to. [chuckles]

511
00:21:02,219 --> 00:21:04,304
[laughing]

512
00:21:10,143 --> 00:21:12,396
You are ruining my life, Ron Howard!

513
00:21:12,479 --> 00:21:14,022
-You're ruining it!

517
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:25,242
I'm gonna start wearing a hat
when I get my haircut, too.

518
00:21:25,325 --> 00:21:26,159
What is wrong with you?

519
00:21:26,243 --> 00:21:29,621
You knew that Ron Howard was
Rebel Alley's father?

520
00:21:29,705 --> 00:21:30,664
Yes, everyone does.

521
00:21:31,206 --> 00:21:33,208
I didn't realize that's who you thought
the other man was,

522
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:34,793
but the good news is,

523
00:21:34,876 --> 00:21:37,087
at least one of our projects
is still going, which...

524
00:21:37,713 --> 00:21:39,381
by the way,
I haven't signed this yet.

525
00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:40,299
Should I?

526
00:21:40,716 --> 00:21:43,218
Yes, absolutely. Thank you.

530

This is exciting.

Thank you.

532
00:21:57,149 --> 00:21:58,358
