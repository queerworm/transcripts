00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:22,775
{\an8}Because it looks like
a monument to George W. Bush.

170
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:26,571
{\an8}Well, you got me.

171
00:07:26,904 --> 00:07:28,865
You're in for a rude
awakening, Sitwell.

172
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:30,700
It's too thin.

173
00:07:31,325 --> 00:07:32,827
It'll never stand.

174
00:07:33,661 --> 00:07:37,582
{\an8}<i>And later that day, he shared</i>
<i>the happy discovery with his wife,</i>

175
00:07:38,082 --> 00:07:40,251
{\an8}<i>who was still held at the Coast Guard.</i>

176
00:07:40,334 --> 00:07:42,128
I mean,
what else could it be?

177
00:07:42,211 --> 00:07:44,547
You mean other than
a 20 foot-wide monument

178
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:47,216
that goes five miles
into the sky?

179
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:50,428
It's a wall, George.
You're looking at it sideways.

180
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:53,473
The "W" stands for "Wall."

181
00:07:53,931 --> 00:07:56,851
-The bushes...
-Stand for the bushes.

182
00:07:56,934 --> 00:07:59,061
This explains the immigration booth

183
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:00,438
10,000 feet in the air.

184
00:08:00,521 --> 00:08:02,857
It's to separate the U.S. and Mexico,

185
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:06,360
to keep out the immigrants,
which was my idea!

186
00:08:06,444 --> 00:08:07,945
I remember you said that

187
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:10,406
right after Lupe put the bleach stain

188
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:11,866
on your teal blazer.

189
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:13,618
How did you miss this, George?

190
00:08:13,701 --> 00:08:15,578
This is business we should have.

191
00:08:15,661 --> 00:08:19,040
Is this how you're going
to let it all end, as a failure?

192
00:08:19,123 --> 00:08:22,585
-Is that your plan?
-No, of course not.

193
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:24,212
<i>It was his plan.</i>

194
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:28,216
<i>Discouraged and questioning</i>
<i>his own manhood,</i>

195
00:08:28,549 --> 00:08:31,385
<i>George Sr. went for lunch</i>
<i>alone at the club...</i>

196
00:08:31,469 --> 00:08:32,720
I thought I already seated you.

197
00:08:32,803 --> 00:08:35,056
<i>...when he saw a familiar face:</i>

198
00:08:35,681 --> 00:08:38,601
<i>His own, on his twin brother,</i>
<i>Oscar.</i>

199
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:39,810
George!

200
00:08:39,894 --> 00:08:41,979
Actually, we came in
to use the bathroom,

201
00:08:42,063 --> 00:08:42,980
but they sat me.

202
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:44,273
Will you join us?

203
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:45,983
Will you have
a mahi-mahi on me?

204
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,610
-On you.
-Fine.

205
00:08:47,693 --> 00:08:50,488
But I'm gonna sit opposite you,
so it won't look bad.

206
00:08:50,571 --> 00:08:52,865
These are my friends,
we all live in the desert together.

207
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:55,618
This is Heartfire.
She's an aura specialist.

208
00:08:55,743 --> 00:08:57,411
She did Matthew Modine.

209
00:08:59,622 --> 00:09:01,290
I will.

210
00:09:01,415 --> 00:09:03,376
Heartfire would like
some more crackers.

211
00:09:03,918 --> 00:09:05,920
And Dr. Norman lives
with us now.

212
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:08,839
Doctor Norman is
a disgraced anesthesiologist.

213
00:09:08,923 --> 00:09:11,342
No, the bigger crime
would've been

214
00:09:11,425 --> 00:09:13,553
the patient didn't wake up
and testify against me.

215
00:09:13,636 --> 00:09:15,638
But nobody cares about the part
of the oath you kept.

216
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:18,099
If he as bad as the
State of California say he is,

217
00:09:18,182 --> 00:09:21,060
then why did I fall in love
with him?

218
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:23,229
[bleep] the state of California!

219
00:09:23,354 --> 00:09:24,188
[bleep] them!

220
00:09:24,272 --> 00:09:27,900
Bunch of California [bleep], yeah.

221
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:29,652
Do you know China Garden?

222
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:31,529
I know the downtown one.

223
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:34,907
You know, I shouldn't judge,
'cause you have friends, and I...

224
00:09:35,866 --> 00:09:36,951
I envy that.

225
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:40,037
You're welcome
to my friends, brother.

226
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:46,168
I don't want these.

227
00:09:47,044 --> 00:09:50,423
<i>Gob also had a new friend</i>
<i>he didn't want.</i>

228
00:09:50,506 --> 00:09:54,051
<i>And later that night, he went</i>
<i>to break in on and up with her.</i>

229
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:57,597
<i>Gob!</i>

230
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,807
For a second,
I thought that was a real guy.

231
00:10:00,182 --> 00:10:03,269
So, listen, I talked to George Michael
and everything's cool.

232
00:10:03,561 --> 00:10:05,313
I need to tell you something.

233
00:10:05,396 --> 00:10:08,316
I've been doing some thinking
and I... I just don't...

234
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:10,526
<i>But as she unzipped her nightsack,</i>

235
00:10:11,193 --> 00:10:14,030
<i>Gob was reminded of past situations</i>

236
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:16,240
<i>in which he'd been successfully aroused.</i>

237
00:10:17,074 --> 00:10:19,076
Well, I could wait 'til after.

238
00:10:24,206 --> 00:10:25,541
<i>Like his son,</i>

239
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:28,294
<i>George Sr. was finding himself closer</i>

240
00:10:28,377 --> 00:10:30,004
<i>to someone than he expected to be.</i>

241
00:10:30,087 --> 00:10:34,008
-I'm not the big man I thought I was.
-Forget the past, George.

242
00:10:34,091 --> 00:10:36,594
<i>And that's when George Sr.</i>
<i>heard something...</i>

243
00:10:36,677 --> 00:10:38,804
I don't know, maybe it's because
I live on the border

244
00:10:38,929 --> 00:10:41,223
between the United States
and Mexico and--

245
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:44,060
-Hold on, hold on... border?
<i>-...that might help make him a big man.</i>

246
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:46,270
You don't think I live
like this all the time, do you?

247
00:10:46,354 --> 00:10:49,523
That's why I had so much fun
at that party on the Queen Mary.

248
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:51,525
And you paid
for my haircut.

249
00:10:51,609 --> 00:10:53,944
And you made me dress like you.

250
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:55,363
Forget the past.

251
00:10:55,446 --> 00:10:58,240
What were you saying about
that property on the border?

252
00:10:58,449 --> 00:11:01,369

You will kill me for that.

00:12:01,053 --> 00:12:03,222
<i>With his mother gone,</i>

273

00:12:12,982 --> 00:12:16,068
"No, no, no, I mean it.

277
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:17,445
<i>But he knew it wasn't real...</i>

278
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:20,531

<i>-...at first.</i>
-What?

280
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:26,871
But that would take hours.

281
00:12:26,954 --> 00:12:29,331

You are always so right.

283
00:12:32,877 --> 00:12:34,628

"I'm sorry. Who are you?"

285
00:12:36,338 --> 00:12:38,591

287

<i>But while Buster was constructing</i>

289
00:12:47,725 --> 00:12:49,393
So how did you

290
00:12:49,477 --> 00:12:51,061
I said you were fine.

291
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:53,689
So, was there something

292
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:55,024

through my window?

293
00:12:56,901 --> 00:12:58,152

the simplest recipe, Mother.

339
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:22,922
<i>But finally, Lucille was released</i>
<i>under house arrest.</i>

340
00:15:23,505 --> 00:15:25,883
<i>And everything returned to normal.</i>

341
00:15:27,426 --> 00:15:28,844
I was just thinking about you.

342
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:30,429
<i>George Sr. had gone to see</i>

343
00:15:30,512 --> 00:15:32,723
<i>the equally disturbing home</i>
<i>of his brother.</i>

344
00:15:32,806 --> 00:15:34,266
You live here?

345
00:15:34,391 --> 00:15:36,060
Ask him!

346
00:15:36,268 --> 00:15:37,728
Would you like to watch us make love?

347
00:15:37,811 --> 00:15:39,146
No.
You live here?

348
00:15:39,229 --> 00:15:40,481
We have been.

349
00:15:40,564 --> 00:15:43,525
You see, Mexico starts right at
the end of that gully,

350
00:15:43,651 --> 00:15:45,486
and we have to get
in and out of there

351
00:15:45,569 --> 00:15:46,904
so we can get
at the maca root.

352
00:15:46,987 --> 00:15:48,656
What the hell is maca root?

353
00:15:48,739 --> 00:15:50,699
It's an ancient Aztec power herb.

354
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52,159
It's an endocrine adaptogen.

355
00:15:52,242 --> 00:15:54,036
It's legal to grow in Mexico,

356
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:56,038
but it's against the law
to consume it there.

357
00:15:56,163 --> 00:15:58,958
Of course, you can ingest it here,
but you can't grow it.

358
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:02,044
So you guys are knowingly
breaking the law.

359
00:16:02,127 --> 00:16:05,714
{\an8}But it's worth it, because maca
has powerful properties,

360
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:08,467
especially when combined
with an hour in the sweat lodge.

361
00:16:08,592 --> 00:16:11,428
It gets up to 110
degrees in there.

362
00:16:11,553 --> 00:16:12,388
Sounds fun.

363
00:16:12,471 --> 00:16:14,223
Oh, but you
have to do it with us.

364
00:16:14,348 --> 00:16:17,393
You'll find a power
you didn't know you had.

365
00:16:17,518 --> 00:16:20,270
But, you want to do it soon,

366
00:16:20,396 --> 00:16:24,066
because they're kicking
us off of the land.

367
00:16:24,733 --> 00:16:25,693
I'm sorry.

368
00:16:25,776 --> 00:16:27,653
Oh, great.
Now you're gonna make me cry.

369
00:16:27,736 --> 00:16:29,113
A lizard, look!
Look, a lizard!

370
00:16:29,196 --> 00:16:30,155
Cute!

371
00:16:30,322 --> 00:16:31,657
What if I were
to buy this land?

372
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:33,826
I don't understand.
Why would you want to do that?

373
00:16:33,951 --> 00:16:36,620
Well, I always talk
about being a great man.

374
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:40,290
Maybe a way to do that is not by being

375
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:42,751
the biggest businessman
in Southern California, it's...

376
00:16:42,876 --> 00:16:46,422
It's by being the best brother
in Southern California.

377
00:16:46,547 --> 00:16:48,340
<i>George Sr. was going to say,</i>

378
00:16:48,465 --> 00:16:51,093
<i>"By gouging the government</i>
<i>when they needed the land</i>

379
00:16:51,176 --> 00:16:52,594
<i>for Sitwell's wall."</i>

380
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:54,179
You bet.

381
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,557
Hey, guys, we're staying.

382
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:57,933
Oh, thank you.

383
00:16:58,017 --> 00:16:59,810
<i>But he'd save that for Lucille.</i>

384
00:16:59,935 --> 00:17:02,312
-Thank you, maca.
-Thank you, maca!

385
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:08,861
<i>George Sr. shared his plan</i>
<i>with Lucille.</i>

386
00:17:08,944 --> 00:17:11,488
We're going to sell that land
to the government for Sitwell's wall,

387
00:17:11,572 --> 00:17:12,906
then I'm going to take that cash.

388
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:15,451
I am gonna mount a case
that shows that my wife

389
00:17:15,576 --> 00:17:18,203
is not the power-hungry monster

390
00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:20,497
the SEC wants to make her out to be.

391
00:17:20,956 --> 00:17:22,708
You're such a puny thinker.

392
00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:25,753
-Am I puny-thinking again?
-Sitwell's wall?

393
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:28,839
How about our wall?
We build the wall.

394
00:17:28,922 --> 00:17:30,090
We do have the plan.

395
00:17:30,174 --> 00:17:32,176
He says he can build it for 200 million?

396
00:17:32,259 --> 00:17:34,303
We offer to build it for 150 million

397
00:17:34,386 --> 00:17:37,097
and we make up the difference
when we sell the land.

398
00:17:37,181 --> 00:17:40,934
And I use that cash
as a little stimulus for us.

399
00:17:41,018 --> 00:17:42,728
Maybe a little
something for the family.

400
00:17:42,811 --> 00:17:44,646
And we build that sucker...

401
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:46,982
-That's my Georgie!
-...five miles high.

402
00:17:48,108 --> 00:17:49,818
Long. Five miles long.

403
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:51,236
I got nothing in my system

404
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:53,072
but a maca-root cookie.

405
00:17:53,155 --> 00:17:56,283
{\an8}You know, we can't look like
we're in cahoots on this,

406
00:17:56,366 --> 00:17:58,077
especially with my trial coming up.

407
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,453
Yeah, that's right.

408
00:17:59,536 --> 00:18:01,830
We have to separate our assets...

409
00:18:01,955 --> 00:18:02,956
...to protect this.

410
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:05,626
To protect our love.

411
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:08,754
<i>And that's how they came up</i>
<i>with this.</i>

412
00:18:08,837 --> 00:18:11,882
-We're getting divorced!
-Your mother and I are getting a divorce.

413
00:18:11,965 --> 00:18:13,175
<i>Which led to this...</i>

414
00:18:13,258 --> 00:18:15,469
You know what?
I am done with this family.

415
00:18:15,552 --> 00:18:16,845
I hope you've
saved some money,

416
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:19,890
'cause you're gonna need every dime now.
What's this?

417
00:18:20,349 --> 00:18:24,228
<i>But Michael wasn't the only one</i>
<i>who was soon in a bolder place.</i>

418
00:18:24,311 --> 00:18:26,855
And yea, as if to be arisen,

419
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:29,650
the third or fourth day
with all the magic of...

420
00:18:29,733 --> 00:18:31,902
Jesus Christ!

421
00:18:32,236 --> 00:18:34,780
Sorry. Wasn't on there too good.

422
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:37,616
You okay?

423
00:18:37,699 --> 00:18:39,701
Yeah, it's just part of
my illusion for the wedding.

424
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:40,828
Yeah, what's the illusion?

425
00:18:40,911 --> 00:18:42,371
That you actually love the bride?

426
00:18:42,454 --> 00:18:43,330
Hey.

427
00:18:43,872 --> 00:18:44,998
That's good patter.

428
00:18:45,249 --> 00:18:48,127
Except for... I need people
to root for the Jesus character.

429
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:50,796
I don't remember a passage
where Jesus came out of a boulder.

430
00:18:50,879 --> 00:18:51,713
Is it in there?

431
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:53,340
Oh, no, the boulder's my escape plan.

432
00:18:53,423 --> 00:18:55,592
They think I'm somewhere else.
I'm in the boulder.

433
00:18:55,676 --> 00:18:58,512
But I didn't come here to talk
about my magic act, Michael.

434
00:18:58,595 --> 00:19:01,348
I came to ask you
to be my best man...

435
00:19:02,516 --> 00:19:03,433
...slash-assistant.

436
00:19:03,517 --> 00:19:05,269
And then we'll walk through
the act later.

437
00:19:05,352 --> 00:19:06,979
-I mean, not now.
-No, we're not going to,

438
00:19:07,062 --> 00:19:08,897
'cause I'm out of the family.

439
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:11,775
Did you not get that when
I announced it over at Mom's place?

440
00:19:12,484 --> 00:19:14,611
I feel like I was out of the room
at that point.

441
00:19:14,695 --> 00:19:16,029
I am done with this family.

442
00:19:16,113 --> 00:19:18,574
I hope you've saved
some money 'cause...

443
00:19:20,868 --> 00:19:22,161
Well, the gist of it was,

444
00:19:22,244 --> 00:19:24,079
"You know what?
I'm done with this family.

445
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:27,249
Hope you saved your money 'cause
you're gonna need every last dime now."

446
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:30,627
Maybe you could be a centurion,
kind of standing over

447
00:19:30,711 --> 00:19:33,255
-where they think that I'll be.
-I'm not going to be in the act.

448
00:19:33,338 --> 00:19:34,882
A great promotion
for the Bluth Company.

449
00:19:34,965 --> 00:19:36,675
No, Bluth Company's done.
I started my own,

450
00:19:36,758 --> 00:19:38,468
Michael B. Company.

451
00:19:38,552 --> 00:19:39,803
I have a bee company.

452
00:19:39,887 --> 00:19:42,681
-You stole my idea?
-I did not steal your...

453
00:19:42,764 --> 00:19:44,933
We sell...
It would take hours.

454
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:46,602
How's that going,
by the way?

455
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:47,936
Not so good.

456
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:49,521
I've been keeping
bees in my apartment.

457
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:51,857
I was using my
magic smoke on them.

458
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:53,525
My bees are
dropping like flies,

459
00:19:53,609 --> 00:19:55,360
and I need them
to fly like bees.

460
00:19:55,444 --> 00:19:57,654
And so I've got them at
a bee hospital, which isn't cheap,

461
00:19:57,738 --> 00:19:59,823
which is another reason I need to be
a famous magician.

462
00:19:59,907 --> 00:20:01,742
Yeah, well, listen,
you're with my son's ex,

463
00:20:01,825 --> 00:20:03,410
so I can't
support the wedding.

464
00:20:03,493 --> 00:20:06,663
What if I don't actually get married?

465
00:20:07,748 --> 00:20:09,666
Is this an escape act
you're running again?

466
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:10,918
What do you want from me?

467
00:20:11,001 --> 00:20:13,712
Marriage is a lot of pressure,
and she's not into it.

468
00:20:13,795 --> 00:20:17,341
Meanwhile, I'm working out like crazy,
my diet has become insane.

469
00:20:17,424 --> 00:20:21,011
And this Jesus character,
I mean, he was shredded!

470
00:20:21,094 --> 00:20:23,096
Meanwhile, we have
sex one time,

471
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:25,432
and then she's just,
you know, over it.

472
00:20:25,515 --> 00:20:28,143
Lets herself go.
Her stomach's out to here.

473
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:31,355
<i>And that's when Michael</i>
<i>finally explained to his brother</i>

474
00:20:31,438 --> 00:20:33,315
<i>how to be a real man.</i>

475
00:20:33,398 --> 00:20:36,401
You know, your whole
life is an escape act,

476
00:20:36,485 --> 00:20:38,403
and this girl seems
like she really likes you.

477
00:20:38,487 --> 00:20:40,030
Why don't you just
try to work it out

478
00:20:40,113 --> 00:20:41,698
and just stop running...

479
00:20:45,202 --> 00:20:47,079
Yeah, I know you're in the boulder.

480
00:20:49,206 --> 00:20:50,916
[Gob] But how'd I get in the boulder?

481
00:21:01,843 --> 00:21:06,431
<i>On the next </i>Arrested Development:
Fateful Consequences...

482
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:10,060
<i>No one from the Bluth family</i>
<i>shows up for the wedding</i>

483
00:21:10,143 --> 00:21:12,229
<i>Gob is planning to run away from.</i>

484
00:21:12,312 --> 00:21:14,189
I don't know what
your surprise trick is,

485
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:15,607
but I know it's
going to be great.

486
00:21:15,691 --> 00:21:18,068
And Ann helps Gob find acceptance.

487
00:21:18,151 --> 00:21:21,989
And as for your family,
you have a new family now.

488
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:26,994
I don't want these.
