00:00:17,851 --> 00:00:19,269
[narrator] <i>Michael Bluth had discovered</i>

2
00:00:19,352 --> 00:00:22,856
<i>that a feature story about him</i>
<i>had appeared in a magazine.</i>

3
00:00:22,939 --> 00:00:23,815
Hi. Hello.

4
00:00:23,898 --> 00:00:25,859
Hey. Where are you heading today, sir?

5
00:00:25,942 --> 00:00:27,569
[narrator]
<i>It was only available on airplanes.</i>

6
00:00:27,652 --> 00:00:30,321
Actually, I just want a copy
of your in-flight magazine <i>Altitude.</i>

7
00:00:30,405 --> 00:00:33,450
This is ticketing.
You can get the magazine on the flight.

8
00:00:33,533 --> 00:00:36,661
I get it. But I'm actually...
I'm in the magazine.

9
00:00:36,745 --> 00:00:37,704
How many bags?

10
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:40,623
I'm not checking these.

11
00:00:40,957 --> 00:00:43,334
Sorry, you actually
can't carry those on board.

12
00:00:43,835 --> 00:00:44,961
Let me start over.

13
00:00:45,086 --> 00:00:48,506
I am the star of <i>Altitude</i> magazine
this month.

14
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:50,925
Or quarter actually.
It's an April-September issue.

15
00:00:51,009 --> 00:00:52,218
I just want a copy.

16
00:00:52,302 --> 00:00:56,139
[narrator] <i>Michael hoped the article would</i>
<i>generate interest in his housing business,</i>

17
00:00:56,264 --> 00:00:58,349
<i>which had been going through a dry spell.</i>

18
00:00:58,475 --> 00:01:00,769
<i>This, combined with some other misfortunes</i>

19
00:01:00,852 --> 00:01:03,772
<i>had led Michael to sacrifice some</i>
<i>of his privacy</i>

20
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:06,024
<i>and move into the dormitory of his son...</i>

21
00:01:06,107 --> 00:01:07,442
Name one way we're different.

22
00:01:07,525 --> 00:01:09,360
[narrator]
<i>...with whom he'd always been close.</i>

23
00:01:09,444 --> 00:01:12,530
<i>But as exciting as the news</i>
<i>about his magazine article was...</i>

24
00:01:12,614 --> 00:01:15,116
They're gonna be in seat backs today?
That's great news.

25
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,452
[narrator]
<i>It was tempered by the intrusion...</i>

26
00:01:17,535 --> 00:01:19,788
Probably doesn't have it.
Tried finding a flight?

27
00:01:19,871 --> 00:01:21,790
[narrator]
<i>...of George Michael's other roommate.</i>

28
00:01:21,873 --> 00:01:23,500
Ever been on a plane, you [bleeps]

29
00:01:24,667 --> 00:01:27,128
[narrator] <i>It was the desire</i>
<i>to be closer to his son...</i>

30
00:01:27,212 --> 00:01:28,338
P-Hound was suggesting

31
00:01:28,421 --> 00:01:31,591
that maybe we do a vote
to see who stays in the dorm room.

32
00:01:31,674 --> 00:01:33,259
Right, then he's gone in seconds.

33
00:01:33,343 --> 00:01:36,096
[narrator] <i>...that led Michael to embrace</i>
<i>the voting idea as his own.</i>

34
00:01:36,179 --> 00:01:37,305
We gotta do it.

35
00:01:37,388 --> 00:01:39,557
-Not flying anywhere.
-Why do you have suitcases?

36
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:41,893
-Those are irrelevant.
-Not to me.

37
00:01:42,143 --> 00:01:42,977
Okay.

38
00:01:43,061 --> 00:01:45,647
[narrator] <i>The suitcases were part</i>
<i>of a series of solutions</i>

39
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:47,273
<i>that Michael implemented...</i>

40
00:01:47,357 --> 00:01:48,942
It puts me in an awkward position.

41
00:01:49,025 --> 00:01:51,402
Everyone's going to know
who voted against who.

42
00:01:51,569 --> 00:01:54,697
[narrator]  <i>...to Salvage a highly fraught</i>
<i>voting scheme.</i>

43
00:01:54,989 --> 00:01:56,324
What if I vote myself out?

44
00:01:56,407 --> 00:01:58,993
[narrator] <i>As whenever he found a solution</i>
<i>to one problem...</i>

45
00:01:59,077 --> 00:02:00,286
Wouldn't that be a tie?

46
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:01,704
[narrator] <i> ...another problem emerged.</i>

47
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:02,705
All right, new plan.

48
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:05,542
If it's two votes against me,
then P-Hound is being nasty...

49
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:07,001
[narrator] <i>Then more problems...</i>

50
00:02:07,085 --> 00:02:08,044
Vote against P-Hound.

51
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:10,296
-[narrator] <i>And so on.</i>
-We all pack ahead of time.

52
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:13,133
Really pack a bag,
so it doesn't look rigged, you know?

53
00:02:13,299 --> 00:02:15,343
[narrator]
<i>So Michael can't be blamed for feeling...</i>

54
00:02:15,468 --> 00:02:18,555
I was mistakenly voted out
of a four-person housing situation

55
00:02:18,638 --> 00:02:20,932
in a pack-first,
no-talking-after scenario.

56
00:02:21,015 --> 00:02:22,142
Does that clear it up?

57
00:02:22,517 --> 00:02:24,185
What do you mean by "mistakenly"?

58
00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:27,856
[narrator] <i>The mistake was not realizing</i>
<i>it was actually his son's idea...</i>

59
00:02:27,939 --> 00:02:30,358
-I voted against myself...
-...vote against himself.

60
00:02:30,441 --> 00:02:32,569
[narrator]
<i>...to get Michael to vote against himself.</i>

61
00:02:32,652 --> 00:02:34,404
Vote his own father out of his dorm.

62
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:36,823
But that leaves three other votes.

63
00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:38,783
Michael.

64
00:02:38,908 --> 00:02:39,742
Michael.

65
00:02:39,909 --> 00:02:40,743
Michael.

66
00:02:43,496 --> 00:02:45,790
-Can I get a magazine, please?
-No, I'm sorry.

67
00:02:45,874 --> 00:02:47,333
They're actually for passengers.

68
00:02:47,417 --> 00:02:50,211
We don't even give out nuts,
so we can't give you a magazine.

69
00:02:50,295 --> 00:02:52,172
-Who wants nuts?
-I don't want nuts.

70
00:02:52,255 --> 00:02:54,883
I want to just jump onto the plane,
grab a magazine.

71
00:02:54,966 --> 00:02:58,011
Okay, sure. We just let people walk
onto the plane all the time.

72
00:02:58,094 --> 00:03:00,513
Do you want a box cutter also?

73
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:02,432
Nice.

74
00:03:02,515 --> 00:03:04,017
These guys are jerks.

75
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:05,435
I got your back.

76
00:03:06,144 --> 00:03:08,021
[man] <i>Attention passengers for flight...</i>

77
00:03:08,396 --> 00:03:11,399
Tell you what, give me a ticket
to your cheapest destination, please.

78
00:03:11,482 --> 00:03:13,276
[narrator]
<i>So, Michael found his seat...</i>

79
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:16,738
<i>with no seat back in front of him.</i>

80
00:03:16,821 --> 00:03:17,697
Hello. Hi.

81
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:20,742
Does each ticket entitle the passenger
to an in-flight magazine?

82
00:03:21,075 --> 00:03:22,619
No, it only guarantees you a seat.

83
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:24,704
Perhaps I can ask
another passenger for one,

84
00:03:24,787 --> 00:03:26,122
or if I'd rather, you can.

85
00:03:26,789 --> 00:03:29,959
[narrator] <i>Michael had to go back four</i>
<i>seats before someone would.</i>

86
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:32,879
<i>And Michael kicked himself</i>

87
00:03:32,962 --> 00:03:35,423
<i>for a pose he thought</i>

{\an8}Fateful Consequences.

96

{\an8}<i>Michael was a man who, for years,</i>
<i>had threatened to leave his family</i>

97
00:04:05,453 --> 00:04:07,455
{\an8}<i>but had always stayed for his son.</i>

98
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:09,874
{\an8}<i>But now he no longer had that excuse</i>

99

{\an8}<i>nor anywhere to live</i>

100
00:04:12,585 --> 00:04:17,131
{\an8}<i>and he found himself with nothing to lose</i>
<i>in a town that he'd always imagined...</i>

103
00:04:23,846 --> 00:04:25,807
<i>Michael had hope.</i>

104

[Herbert] <i>...to build a wall...</i>

106
00:04:31,729 --> 00:04:35,233

We offer to build it for 150 million

{\an8}If you support the wall...

116

121

{\an8}Yeah, but when I unveiled it
in Garden Grove,

122

{\an8}Hello.

133
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:42,300
{\an8}Oh, we're doing a survey
for the US government, ma'am.

134

{\an8}Oh, no, I'm a man.

135
00:05:44,635 --> 00:05:47,221
{\an8}I was just wearing this blouse

136
00:05:47,305 --> 00:05:49,557
because I was driving, and I hate my arms.

137
00:05:50,266 --> 00:05:51,225
What's the tape for?

138
00:05:51,309 --> 00:05:54,312
{\an8}Laying out border coordinates
for when they put up the wall.

139
00:05:54,896 --> 00:05:56,856
{\an8}You're not supposed to tell him
what it's for.

140
00:05:56,939 --> 00:05:59,650
{\an8}Well, he already mentioned the tape,
and he looks American.

141
00:05:59,734 --> 00:06:01,235
{\an8}Yeah, but he's in Mexico.

142
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:04,697
Wait. Guys, no.
Mexico starts back there by the gully.

143

Whoever told you that
is probably chomping on the maca.

144
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:10,745
So, what you're saying
is that on this side of the tape,

145
00:06:10,828 --> 00:06:11,871
I'm in Mexico,

146
00:06:12,121 --> 00:06:13,373

147
00:06:13,456 --> 00:06:15,458
Whoa! We're gonna need
to see a passport, sir.

No.

167
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:06,050
No, Gob.

168
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:10,012
[narrator] <i>It was Lindsay.</i>

169
00:07:15,601 --> 00:07:17,937
<i>-Michael Bluth was starting a new job</i>
-[horn honks]

170
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:20,982
<i>when he received a call</i>
<i>from attorney Barry Zuckerkorn.</i>

171
00:07:21,065 --> 00:07:23,067
Hello. Michael Bluth,
Residential Complexes.

172
00:07:23,985 --> 00:07:24,819
[Barry] <i>Hey, Michael.</i>

173
00:07:24,902 --> 00:07:26,696
<i>-You're in real estate again?</i>
-Sort of.

174
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:29,407
[narrator] <i>Michael had tried</i>
<i>to leave real estate behind</i>

175
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:31,451
<i>and get a job in the high-tech sector.</i>

176
00:07:31,534 --> 00:07:34,203
However, I will tell you that
in my last position,

177
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:35,913
I had a company car provision.

178
00:07:36,205 --> 00:07:38,499
We may have something
that can get you a car.

179
00:07:39,375 --> 00:07:40,626
-Hey, Gare-Bear?
-Yeah?

180
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:41,919
I think we got an ostrich.

181
00:07:42,003 --> 00:07:43,421
-Oh, God, grab him.
-What is it?

182
00:07:43,504 --> 00:07:46,924
Now, with this car,
you may get some stares.

183
00:07:47,216 --> 00:07:48,968
I'm used to a car
with some stairs.

184
00:07:49,051 --> 00:07:53,014
[narrator] <i>Albeit one that had trouble</i>
<i>negotiating low-hanging obstacles...</i>

185
00:07:54,515 --> 00:07:56,767
-[horn honks]
-[tires screech]

186
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:00,104
[narrator] <i>Which is why he parted</i>
<i>with it.</i>

187
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:04,442
I'm actually working in high tech,
but it does collide with real estate.

188
00:08:05,401 --> 00:08:06,611
This is gonna be low.

189
00:08:07,612 --> 00:08:08,654
Oh, I hooked it.

190
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:09,906
[narrator] <i>Michael was driving a car</i>

191
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:13,284
<i>from a company that shows</i>
<i>every private residence in the country.</i>

192
00:08:14,619 --> 00:08:18,998
<i>But it's also a company that won't let us</i>
<i>show the car that takes those pictures.</i>

193
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:21,626
<i>In fairness to them, it is their property.</i>

194
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:24,086
<i>-If you want to know the company...</i>
-[man] You [bleeps]

195
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:26,422
[Michael] Save it.
We're just gonna blur it anyway.

196
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:29,008
[narrator] <i>...all you have to</i>
<i>do is "something" it.</i>

197
00:08:29,091 --> 00:08:29,967
Barry? Still there?

198
00:08:30,051 --> 00:08:34,722
So, I got a really interesting call
from Ron Howard of all people.

199
00:08:35,097 --> 00:08:36,516
He's directing now, apparently,

200
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:39,393
and wants to meet you
at his office in, get this...

201
00:08:39,644 --> 00:08:40,645
Beverly Hills.

202
00:08:40,728 --> 00:08:42,021
Why does Ron Howard--

203
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,148
Why does Ron Howard want to meet me?

204
00:08:44,232 --> 00:08:45,733
His office didn't say,

205
00:08:45,816 --> 00:08:47,944
and I'm a little busy
with a case of my own.

206
00:08:48,236 --> 00:08:50,154
<i>Want me to tell him</i>
<i>to go</i> [bleeps] <i>himself?</i>

207
00:08:50,238 --> 00:08:52,406
<i>I can tell Ron Howard</i>
<i>to go </i>[bleeps] <i>himself.</i>

208
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:55,326
I just can't do it now,
because I'm in front of a jury.

209
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:56,744
I will meet with him.

210
00:08:57,036 --> 00:09:00,414
-You're in front of a jury now?
<i>-And the looks I'm getting. Got to go.</i>

211
00:09:00,665 --> 00:09:02,625
Sorry, everybody.
I'm an attorney, too.

212
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:05,002
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,

213
00:09:05,086 --> 00:09:07,213
I'd like the defendant
to reach over the gate,

214
00:09:07,463 --> 00:09:10,591
open it from the inside
and enter the school property, please.

215
00:09:11,425 --> 00:09:13,970
I can't reach it.
I can't reach the Chachi.

216
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:16,847
If he can't reach,
this trial's a breach.

217
00:09:16,931 --> 00:09:19,141
Ooh, and that's what we call a law bomb.

218
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:20,643
That's a low blow, Loblaw.

219
00:09:20,768 --> 00:09:21,852
A Bob Loblaw law bomb.

220
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:25,314
[narrator] <i>As a client,</i>

[narrator] <i>And in retribution</i>
<i>to a brother who lied to him...</i>

227
00:09:42,498 --> 00:09:45,042
So we only did buy that land

228
00:09:45,126 --> 00:09:46,752
[narrator] <i>Oscar chose to lie...</i>

229

-[narrator] <i>With George's wife.</i>
-Call me Father B.

230
00:09:51,048 --> 00:09:54,468
[narrator] <i> And although too explicit</i>
<i>for an American audience,</i>

231
00:09:54,552 --> 00:09:56,762

234

No.

235
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:06,689
I mean, it's good
to be out of that sweaty old hot box

236
00:10:06,772 --> 00:10:07,857
at the compound.

237
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:09,525
-No, this was amazing.
-Oh.

238
00:10:10,234 --> 00:10:13,487
[narrator] <i>And Oscar finally got more</i>
<i>information about his brother's plans.</i>

239

We may need to have
a president ready to go

240
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:20,036
if something should happen to Lucille 2
while we're building the wall.

241
00:10:20,703 --> 00:10:22,038
So we are building a wall.

242
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:25,416
Right where Oscar
thought he would be spending

243
00:10:25,499 --> 00:10:26,584
the rest of his life.

244
00:10:26,667 --> 00:10:29,920
[laughs] Turn him around three times,
put him in Fullerton.

245
00:10:30,004 --> 00:10:31,964
-He won't know the difference.
-Fullerton.

246
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:35,134
You know, I think we should
send our son down there.

247
00:10:35,843 --> 00:10:38,179
Give him some training,
show that he has a job.

248
00:10:38,262 --> 00:10:39,347
Let him sweat a little.

249
00:10:40,056 --> 00:10:42,808
Buster? No. I won't hear of it.
It could kill him.

250
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:44,810
I meant Gob.

251
00:10:45,227 --> 00:10:48,064
Oh! Fine.
Yeah, send him down. I love that.

252
00:10:49,023 --> 00:10:51,067
[narrator]
<i>But not before an ominous warning.</i>

253
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:54,070
But, you know, he has magical abilities.

254
00:10:54,862 --> 00:10:57,531
He can handle a lot more
than we give him credit for.

255
00:10:57,782 --> 00:10:58,783
I know.

256
00:10:59,909 --> 00:11:00,743
What?

257
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:05,081
[narrator]<i> In fact, Gob hadn't been</i>
<i>feeling magical at all lately.</i>

258
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:08,459
<i>Ever since he wasn't able to open</i>
<i>a secret compartment.</i>

<i>With his own career in shambles,</i>

263
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:24,684
<i>Gobs understandably excited</i>
<i>to receive a call from his mother.</i>

264

<i>It's your mother. We're going to plan B.</i>

266
00:11:31,899 --> 00:11:33,943
Finally. I will not disappoint you, Mom.

267
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:36,570
I am the perfect person
to look out for this family.

268

269
00:11:37,822 --> 00:11:39,699

<i>And he got his first taste</i>
<i>of how cruel Hollywood can be.</i>

275
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:55,256
That's not very nice.

276
00:11:55,339 --> 00:11:58,092
"Ankles" means "leaves"

I work here. I'm a D girl.
No, I don't want to see them.

I'm not going to show you my [bleeps]
you pig.

280
00:12:07,601 --> 00:12:09,019
It means "development."

281
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:12,398
I'm a movie executive.
I work for Ron Howard now.

282
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:14,817
[narrator]
<i>And she'd proven as loyal to him</i>

283

<i>as she was to her former boss,</i>
<i>Michael's father.</i>

Do you have any idea
why Ron Howard wants to see me?

00:12:23,451 --> 00:12:25,578
Believe me,
if I could think like Ron Howard,

287
00:12:25,661 --> 00:12:28,330
I'd own the second largest building
in Beverly Hills.

288

[narrator]<i> Only Jerry Bruckheimer's</i>

290
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:36,297
-Mr. Howard will see you now.
-Oh, great.

291
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:37,673
I'll take you to the private elevator.

292
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:39,467
Going to meet the big man himself.

293
00:12:39,633 --> 00:12:43,012

-Hi. Hey.
-Oh, Michael.

298
00:12:51,395 --> 00:12:52,897
Hey! Thanks for coming down.

299
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:55,733
I'm finishing up casting this
<i>Andy Griffith Show </i>thing.

300
00:12:56,233 --> 00:12:58,861
Hang on a second.
Are you guys finally making that movie?

301
00:12:58,944 --> 00:13:00,821
I've been reading about it for 40 years.

302
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:03,949
Well, it's not a done deal yet,
but I want to talk about you.

303
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:05,743
-Yeah.
-Hey, let's go inside the LEM.

304
00:13:05,826 --> 00:13:06,660
You want to?

305
00:13:07,161 --> 00:13:09,246
Is this the one that landed on the moon?

306
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:12,041
-On a soundstage.
-Oh, right, from  Apollo 13.

307
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:13,709
No, 1969.

308
00:13:14,418 --> 00:13:16,462
NASA did go to the moon in '71

309
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:18,589
but in '69, they weren't ready,

310
00:13:18,923 --> 00:13:22,426
so they faked the whole thing
on the soundstage of  <i>Gentle Ben.</i>

311
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:23,594
Boy.

312
00:13:23,677 --> 00:13:26,764
Me and my brother hid up in the rafters.
We seen the whole thing.

313
00:13:26,847 --> 00:13:28,516
But I want to talk to you.

314
00:13:28,682 --> 00:13:29,517
Okay.

315
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:32,478
For the last year,
I've been going to Phoenix.

316
00:13:33,687 --> 00:13:37,566
Whoa. Hang on, now. Are you kidding me?
I'm a Phoenix....

317
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:43,322
I've never met anyone else in person
that also goes there. That's amazing.

318
00:13:43,405 --> 00:13:45,741
That's the downside
of going to college online, huh?

319
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:47,785
Well, I've just got a sick aunt
down there.

320
00:13:47,868 --> 00:13:49,036
-But...
-Oh, I see.

321
00:13:49,119 --> 00:13:50,287
On the last flight,

322
00:13:50,454 --> 00:13:52,706
I was flipping through the magazine,
and I...

323
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,918
-I saw something.
-No, not the begging photo.

324
00:13:56,001 --> 00:13:59,255
I don't think you know this about me,
but most of my movies

325
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:02,466
are based on<i> </i>still photographs
that I find truly inspiring.

326
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:03,884
[narrator]<i> It was true.</i>

327

Splash <i>was based on what turned out</i>
<i>to be a counterfeit Hockney</i>

328
00:14:07,805 --> 00:14:10,015
<i>that Brian talked Ron into buying.</i>

The Da Vinci Code

330
00:14:14,395 --> 00:14:15,229
You know <i>Willow?</i>

331
00:14:15,312 --> 00:14:18,190
That was from a Soft 'n' Snuggly
coupon I got in the mail.

332
00:14:18,566 --> 00:14:21,235
But a man who is passionate enough to beg?

333
00:14:21,777 --> 00:14:25,072
Well, that's a character
whose story we really want to see.

334
00:14:25,155 --> 00:14:28,909
I've been dying to figure out a way
to do something about the market crash

335
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:31,328
ever since my partner Brian Grazer
was tipped off

336
00:14:31,412 --> 00:14:33,038
that it was three months away
from happening.

337
00:14:33,122 --> 00:14:33,956
What's that?

338
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:35,749
But I never had a face to put on it.

339
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:37,668
Until now. You.

340
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:39,712
Your wife is dying.

341
00:14:39,795 --> 00:14:41,755
You're trying to hold
your family together.

342
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:46,176
Oh, gosh, no.
My wife died years before any of this.

343
00:14:47,469 --> 00:14:48,304
Oh, gee.

344
00:14:50,264 --> 00:14:52,600
I think it's a lot more
fun if we see her die.

345
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:53,809
That is fun.

346
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:57,021
And by the way, then it's a fantastic part
for a leading lady.

347
00:14:57,146 --> 00:15:00,190
In fact, my girl Rebel
would be great in that part.

348
00:15:00,524 --> 00:15:01,483
Your girl?

349
00:15:01,817 --> 00:15:04,111
Rebel Alley. She's an actress.
You know her.

[narrator]<i> He didn't.</i>

351
00:15:05,112 --> 00:15:07,907
I do. Yes, of course I do.
Your girl, huh?

352
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:09,909
Well, we like to keep that quiet.

353
00:15:09,992 --> 00:15:13,913
[narrator]<i> Michael assumed "my girl"</i>
<i>was referring to his mistress...</i>

354
00:15:13,996 --> 00:15:15,789
I see why you're telling me in the LEM.

355
00:15:15,956 --> 00:15:18,584
[narrator]<i> ...but Ron was actually talking</i>
<i>about his daughter.</i>

356
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:22,671
You probably think I'm terrible
for even mentioning her.

357
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:24,548
No, I'm not one to judge.

358
00:15:24,632 --> 00:15:26,884
I'm sure you've all got girls here
in Hollywood.

359
00:15:26,967 --> 00:15:28,302
Brian's got two boys.

360
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:37,186
[narrator]<i> Michael was suddenly given</i>
<i>the great opportunity</i>

361
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:38,646
<i>to make something of himself.</i>

362
00:15:38,729 --> 00:15:40,731
You're a natural.
It could be a great movie.

363
00:15:40,814 --> 00:15:43,317
It's a real chance
to show you guys off, too.

364
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:45,611
Us guys?

365
00:15:45,694 --> 00:15:47,446
Well, it's about the whole family.

366
00:15:48,072 --> 00:15:48,906
Them?

367
00:15:48,989 --> 00:15:52,868
We're gonna need everybody's signature
on these releases in order to make this.

368
00:15:52,993 --> 00:15:56,455
Although the real heartbeat of this thing
is the father-son dynamic.

369
00:15:56,538 --> 00:16:00,000
Yeah. You know, Ron,
I don't know if I can do this.

370
00:16:00,542 --> 00:16:03,587
We're not in a great way right now,
and it might not be worth...

371
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:06,173
Take a few of these cards
and really think about it.

372
00:16:06,298 --> 00:16:08,759
-All right.
-I got a tough meeting coming up now.

373
00:16:09,009 --> 00:16:12,012
How do you tell Ed Harris
that he's simply not a Barney?

374
00:16:13,097 --> 00:16:15,641
[narrator]
<i>And while Ed was getting some bad news...</i>

375
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:17,643
Am I a producer?

376
00:16:18,102 --> 00:16:19,645
[narrator] <i>Michael got some good news,</i>

377
00:16:20,396 --> 00:16:23,107
<i>which he promptly shared</i>
<i>with the family attorney.</i>

378
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:25,317
They want me to get
the family's signatures,

379
00:16:25,401 --> 00:16:27,653
especially my father's.

380
00:16:27,861 --> 00:16:30,406
Sounds like your thing
went a lot better than my thing.

381
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:33,283
<i>Except, I haven't spoken to them</i>
<i>for a long time.</i>

382
00:16:33,367 --> 00:16:36,537

Well, since my mom...

383
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:38,497
-Left?
-[camera shutter clicks]

384
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:41,291
Yeah, for prison.
You want to know what?

385
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:42,751
Frankly, I think Ron Howard

386
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:45,087
just wants to get a movie
for his girlfriend.

387
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:47,923
It sounds like Ron Howard is casting
with his [bleeps]

388
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:51,135
Well, it is hard to believe,

389
00:16:51,218 --> 00:16:53,387
but I guess
they've all got their mistresses

390
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:55,014
up here in showbiz, you know?

391
00:16:55,097 --> 00:16:56,849
It's like it's their God-given...

392
00:16:56,932 --> 00:16:57,975
-Front?
-No, right.

393
00:16:58,142 --> 00:17:01,020
-No, right.
-Calm down, everybody. I got it.

394
00:17:01,103 --> 00:17:03,313
You think my dad would ever go for this?

395
00:17:03,397 --> 00:17:05,607
It's very hard
to get a signature out of him.

396
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:07,693
It's like somebody,
a long time ago, said...

397
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:11,238
{\an8}What if you never sign anything,
and say you don't have a signature?

398
00:17:11,321 --> 00:17:13,657
-Just like you, Pop.
-You don't have a signature?

399
00:17:13,741 --> 00:17:15,200
No. He's never given me one card.

400
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:16,410
Not one birthday card,

401
00:17:16,493 --> 00:17:18,996
which is why his presents
are money orders, right?

402
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:20,330
I don't have a signature.

403
00:17:20,622 --> 00:17:24,460
Oh!
If you don't sign, you will be fine. Hey!

404
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:26,962
Barry, I hear what you're saying.
My dad would never do this for me.

405
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:30,049
I'm gonna head back in
and tell Ron Howard to forget about it.

406
00:17:30,132 --> 00:17:31,467
<i>-Yeah, you're screwed.</i>
-Yeah.

407
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:32,509
<i>-Do me a favor.</i>
-Okay.

408
00:17:32,593 --> 00:17:34,803
-Bye, Barry.
<i>-Tell Ron to shove his waffle iron--</i>

409
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:37,097
-Oh!
-Sorry. Oops. Whoa, sorry.

410
00:17:37,181 --> 00:17:39,058
-My fault. Looking at my phone.
-No.

411
00:17:39,141 --> 00:17:42,478
That's not too embarrassing walking around
with photographs of yourself.

412
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:44,605
Well, it's part of your job.
You're an actress, huh?

413
00:17:44,688 --> 00:17:47,232
Yeah. Actually actress
is an overstatement because--

414
00:17:47,316 --> 00:17:50,652
Oh, thank you. I was just sucking
at this audition I went on.

415
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:53,739
It was one of these ridiculous
meet-cute cliches,

416
00:17:53,822 --> 00:17:57,242
when a guy and a girl just bump
into each other, and they...

417
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,328
They fall in love.

418
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:01,580
God, you're handsome.

419
00:18:02,873 --> 00:18:05,626
I got maybe a lucky hair day.
You're the beautiful one.

420
00:18:06,043 --> 00:18:08,128
You have beautiful eyes.

421
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:11,090
My deceased wife had red hair.

422
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,968
Yep, garbage like that
and it's so unbelievable.

423
00:18:15,052 --> 00:18:17,012
Like they never get each other's names.

424
00:18:17,137 --> 00:18:17,971
Pretty stupid.

425
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:20,599
-Oops. Gosh.
-Oh. Ow!

426
00:18:20,682 --> 00:18:22,309
-Are you okay?
-That really hurt.

427
00:18:22,434 --> 00:18:24,686
I wish I'd done that well in the audition.

428
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:25,604
[Michael laughs]

429
00:18:25,687 --> 00:18:27,731
Where's a movie producer
when you need one, right?

430
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:29,274
It was really nice to meet you.

431
00:18:29,358 --> 00:18:30,275
Yes, you, too.

432
00:18:32,194 --> 00:18:33,278
I'm a movie producer.

433
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:35,781
Sorry. I'm a movie... Here, I've got...

434
00:18:36,156 --> 00:18:38,075
I got proof here, huh?

435
00:18:38,158 --> 00:18:39,743
-You are a movie producer.
-Yeah.

436
00:18:39,827 --> 00:18:43,163
Yeah, there's a part for a wife,
and you'd be perfect for the movie.

437
00:18:43,247 --> 00:18:45,249
-[Michael] Huh.

438
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:47,501

00:18:51,046 --> 00:18:52,172
Yeah. I'm in a band.

441
00:18:52,256 --> 00:18:53,423
I love it. It's great.

tomorrow night.

Maybe you could come
and just check it out.

Sorry. That's funny.

I should have said, "Where?"
I know what it is.

No, it's on the top of that building,

You've got to give me a job

the property was on the border.

492
00:21:04,179 --> 00:21:07,099
It is 50 feet south of the border, Oscar.

493
00:21:07,182 --> 00:21:09,851
Well, excuse me,
but they hadn't put up the tape yet,

494
00:21:09,935 --> 00:21:11,186
and you lied to me.

495
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:13,689
You told me
you bought this property to live on.

496
00:21:13,772 --> 00:21:17,192
No, you bought this property
to put up a wall.

497
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:18,694
I told one lie,

498
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:20,946
but I was going to share the money
with you.

499
00:21:21,029 --> 00:21:21,863
Two lies.

500
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:25,784
And why do I think that you charge
more than $5 for lemonade?

501
00:21:25,867 --> 00:21:27,786
Three small lies.

502
00:21:27,869 --> 00:21:29,746
Now do me a favor. Just get in the tent.

503
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:32,833
Gob's getting rid of the bees.
We'll push the matinee to 3:00.

504
00:21:32,916 --> 00:21:35,085
No, I'm sick and tired
of being in that hut

505
00:21:35,168 --> 00:21:36,753
pretending to be you.

506
00:21:36,837 --> 00:21:40,299
Maybe I should go out there
and pretend to be you.

507
00:21:40,382 --> 00:21:43,302
So, goodbye, George.
This is the last you'll see of me.

508
00:21:44,219 --> 00:21:46,346
I'm just gonna use the can
for one second.

509
00:21:47,097 --> 00:21:49,391
[woman] There's two Dr. Normans!
