-God, I'm just not into Cuatro this year.
-I was the one that was wrong, not you.

-No.

161
00:08:02,523 --> 00:08:06,694
<i>And thanks to viewer Bruce Wallenstein</i>
<i>for sending that in, by the way.</i>

162
00:08:07,403 --> 00:08:09,572
<i>Stan Sitwell had to act fast.</i>

163
00:08:09,655 --> 00:08:11,532
How'd you like to be bumped up
to Lucille 1?

164
00:08:11,657 --> 00:08:14,577
<i>So, the Bluth Company had a new co-owner,</i>

165
00:08:14,744 --> 00:08:16,996
{\an8}<i>while the old one,</i>
<i>who knew she'd be implicated...</i>

166
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:19,207
{\an8}Full steam, boys!

167
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:21,918
<i>...headed out to captain</i>
<i>whatever the opposite</i>

168
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:24,253
<i>of a maiden voyage is called,</i>

169
00:08:24,962 --> 00:08:27,256
{\an8}<i>a strategy their lawyer's son</i>
<i>came up with...</i>

170
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:29,926
{\an8}I was wondering if we shouldn't have
a plan in regards to bookkeeping,

171
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:32,595
{\an8}in case we accidentally make a mistake
or get caught.

172
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:34,889
<i>...on his first day back in the country</i>
<i>from law school.</i>

173
00:08:34,972 --> 00:08:38,100
May I make one suggestion, Pop?
Take to the sea!

174
00:08:38,434 --> 00:08:40,436
{\an8}Three miles out, and it's a free-for-all.

175
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,730
{\an8}No rules. Pirate radio laws.

176
00:08:42,813 --> 00:08:46,442
{\an8}So we will stick together
and have all of our meetings on boats.

177
00:08:46,567 --> 00:08:48,361
We have the best [bleep] attorneys.

178
00:08:48,486 --> 00:08:51,614
{\an8}<i>Michael had somehow intuited</i>
<i>this information as well.</i>

179
00:08:52,281 --> 00:08:53,866
{\an8}<i>And on a boat with his son,</i>

180
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:58,079
{\an8}<i>he made a pledge to let his family</i>
<i>take care of themselves altogether</i>

{\an8}<i>-for a while.</i>
-...for a while.

182
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:01,624
<i>And he set off to sea...</i>

183
00:09:03,334 --> 00:09:05,169
<i>which should have been the end of it.</i>

184
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:07,838
-[phone rings]
<i>-Except, this happened.</i>

185
00:09:09,632 --> 00:09:12,843
{\an8}Hello, Lucille. I still hope you're coming
to our little get-together.

186
00:09:12,927 --> 00:09:15,096
You want to hear something funny?

187
00:09:15,179 --> 00:09:17,223
I never got an invitation!

188
00:09:17,348 --> 00:09:20,309
{\an8}But I feel like I'm there,
because it's all over the news.

189
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:24,355
Oh, honey, is that you?
I'm on my deck waving to you.

190
00:09:24,438 --> 00:09:28,192
{\an8}But with those police boats following you,
I guess I'm waving goodbye.

191
00:09:28,276 --> 00:09:30,695
{\an8}You must be mistaken,
because I can't see you,

192
00:09:30,778 --> 00:09:33,990
{\an8}and you're usually as hard to miss
as Liberace wearing a fright wig.

193
00:09:34,115 --> 00:09:36,284
{\an8}<i>Oh, goodness! That is you!</i>

194
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:38,995
{\an8}I'm practically counting
your cruise speed.

195
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:42,456
Oh, well, maybe I should turn back
and show you another bird.

196
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:44,083
-Hello?
-[garbled response]

197
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:46,085
Did you hear me say that about the bird?
Hello?

198
00:09:46,168 --> 00:09:49,088
[narrator]<i> But it was clear that Lucille 2</i>
<i>hadn't heard it,</i>

199
00:09:49,171 --> 00:09:53,467

-Coming about. Coming about, boys!
<i>-...to show her the bird.</i>

201

[man] We're listing! We're list--

00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:07,189
[narrator] <i>Michael, alone with his son,</i>

203

<i>at last.</i>

204
00:10:10,067 --> 00:10:12,778
<i>He finally felt like the captain</i>

<i>But when he awoke from a brief nap</i>
<i>a short time later,</i>

207
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:21,996
How was the party?

208
00:10:23,414 --> 00:10:24,582
Mom stole it.

209
00:10:25,374 --> 00:10:26,334
The whole boat?

210
00:10:27,043 --> 00:10:28,419
You think we should go back?

211
00:10:28,502 --> 00:10:31,964
Absolutely, she's your mother.
This family has to stick together.

212
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:34,050
Okay. You're afraid she'll turn on you.

213
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:36,927
Won't even leave the table
during a dinner party.

214
00:10:37,011 --> 00:10:40,890
<i>George, of course, was concerned</i>
<i>his wife had already been flipped,</i>

215
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:42,892

<i>None of which would have happened</i>

217

218
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:52,443

<i>changed direction is still unexplained.</i>

219
00:10:52,526 --> 00:10:55,363

<i>will fall under the dominion</i>

221

222

<i>Coast Guard headquarters,</i>

-Excuse me. My wife, where is she?
<i>-...that almost didn't come.</i>

229
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:23,391
Lucky it didn't happen in Autumn,
otherwise she'd be colder.

230
00:11:23,557 --> 00:11:26,727
This is ridiculous! It was an accident.

231
00:11:27,186 --> 00:11:30,064
If I had told him we were taking
a bunch of gays out there to get married,

232
00:11:30,147 --> 00:11:31,232
they'd have thrown me a parade.

Let's tell them we were taking
a bunch of gays to get married.

234

Yeah, I don't think your record on
that issue is gonna back that up, Mom.

235
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:41,409
[narrator]<i> In fact, it was an issue</i>
<i>of the </i>Bay Window<i> magazine</i>

<i>that would most damage her</i>
<i>with the gay community.</i>

237

[Lucille]
Fine, we'll say they took it on a joyride.

238
00:11:46,789 --> 00:11:48,708
And you have no right to criticize me.

239
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:51,877
They are persecuting me
because I'm a white woman

240
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:54,922
who looks 15 years younger
than my real age of 60!

241
00:11:55,256 --> 00:11:56,465
We both do.

242
00:11:57,258 --> 00:12:01,220
{\an8}<i>Moments earlier, Gob was also hoping</i>

244

I want all of these on the insurance form.

245
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:07,810
These were all a part of an act
I was gonna do.

246
00:12:07,893 --> 00:12:10,563
Two drowned white doves,
for flowers to doves.

247
00:12:10,646 --> 00:12:13,774
This was a rabbit, for doves to rabbit.

248
00:12:13,941 --> 00:12:16,485
Also drowned. These were mice--

249
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:17,820
[Tobias] For rabbit to mice.

250
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:20,364
No. That can't be done.

251
00:12:22,283 --> 00:12:25,244
No, these were a part of something
I call Mice-cellaneous.

252
00:12:25,619 --> 00:12:27,830
Mouse in purse. Mouse in drink.

253
00:12:28,539 --> 00:12:30,291
Here's a mouse, now it's gone.

254
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:33,711
<i>-And that's when Gob saw his nephew...</i>
-How'd he do that?

-Hi, Uncle Gob.
<i>-...had so clearly aged the boy.</i>

257

Are we good?

258
00:12:44,513 --> 00:12:46,390
-No.
-No. How could we possibly...

259
00:12:46,474 --> 00:12:48,434
<i>It was clear that to make things right,</i>

260
00:12:48,517 --> 00:12:51,395
<i>Gob would have to do a lot more</i>
<i>than simply say...</i>

261

-But are we-- Are we good?
-No!

262
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:55,733
<i>It appeared he would need to dig</i>
<i>a lot deeper still.</i>

263
00:12:55,858 --> 00:12:59,069
-You stole my girlfriend.
-That's a tough thing and you know,

264
00:12:59,153 --> 00:13:01,489
sometimes you have to ask yourself,
"Are we good?"

265
00:13:01,572 --> 00:13:02,865
Is it over between you guys?

266
00:13:02,948 --> 00:13:04,533
Oh, no. But are we good?

267
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:06,744
I don't know what you want
to hear from me, Uncle Gob.

268
00:13:06,869 --> 00:13:09,622
-I mean, yes, we are good--
-There it is! Oh!

269
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:12,541
<i>It was what he wanted to hear</i>
<i>from George Michael.</i>

270
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:15,085
The much-vaunted yes that he gets.

271
00:13:15,169 --> 00:13:16,587
Look at you, full of yes!

272
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:18,672
Look at how much yes is in you!

273
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:21,217
I knew it!
I knew I'd get that yes from you.

274
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,260
<i>Lucille, however, was far from resigned</i>

275

{\an8}<i>when she caught up with her husband</i>

{\an8}A joyride!

277
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:31,227
{\an8}That's what they decide to do with
the freedom this country has given them.

278
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:33,562
[softly] That's the best alibi
I've been able to come up with,

279
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:37,483
because our lawyer says he thinks
can get rid of the SEC charges,

280
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:40,820
but he's worried about the pirating
of the <i>Queen Mary.</i>

281
00:13:40,945 --> 00:13:42,696
He says they have a suit against us.

282
00:13:42,988 --> 00:13:45,241
-Where is Barry?
-He's with the harbormaster.

283
00:13:45,449 --> 00:13:47,743
He's trying to dazzle them
with a suit of his own.

284
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:51,497
Well, he hated the suit.
Thought I was making fun.

285
00:13:51,914 --> 00:13:55,251
But basically, this is a good news,
bad news deal.

286
00:13:55,626 --> 00:13:57,711
First of all, won't be cheap.

287
00:13:57,795 --> 00:13:59,880
It's gonna cost you a fortune
in legal fees.

288
00:13:59,964 --> 00:14:01,173
What's the good news?

289
00:14:01,298 --> 00:14:02,842
Oh. Yeah, from your perspective,

290
00:14:02,925 --> 00:14:04,635
I can see where you think
it's all bad news.

291
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:08,597
It's all bad news. Whoo!
You're going away for a long time,

292
00:14:08,806 --> 00:14:10,766
unless we can come up with a good alibi.

293
00:14:10,891 --> 00:14:14,937
Mother! Mother! I fell in the ocean.
Why didn't you come for me?

294
00:14:15,437 --> 00:14:17,356
And there it is. I did.

295
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:21,610
Buster, tell them how you were drowning
and I commandeered the ship to save you.

296
00:14:21,902 --> 00:14:22,736
Tell them what I did.

297
00:14:24,655 --> 00:14:25,489
Oh...

298
00:14:26,323 --> 00:14:28,784
She stole the <i>Queen Mary</i>
to get away from the SEC.

299
00:14:28,909 --> 00:14:29,785
Oh, and she winked.

300
00:14:30,828 --> 00:14:33,581
Correction, it's a glare. [giggles]

301
00:14:33,664 --> 00:14:35,791
-All right, let's take her away.
-Whoa, whoa, whoa.

302
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:36,876
What are you doing?

303
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:39,336
Wait! She doesn't have her makeup!
I have her lipstick!

304
00:14:39,461 --> 00:14:40,546
Mother!

305
00:14:40,671 --> 00:14:43,966
<i>And even Michael was having a hard time</i>
<i>keeping them all together.</i>

306
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:44,884
It's gonna be a tough one.

307
00:14:44,967 --> 00:14:47,678
There's about 400 witnesses that already
threw her underneath the boat, buddy.

308
00:14:47,761 --> 00:14:50,514
-I don't think I can even help.
-[Barry] That makes two of us.

309
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:53,976
It turns out that stealing the<i> Queen Mary</i>
comes under maritime law,

310
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:56,812
which I just found out is an actual thing.
Did you know that?

311
00:14:56,937 --> 00:14:58,939
-It's an actual thing.
-Maritime.

312
00:14:59,148 --> 00:15:03,736
<i>And perhaps that's when Michael found</i>
<i>a reason to stick around a little longer.</i>

313
00:15:03,819 --> 00:15:07,364
Don't you worry. We got three months
 to prepare for this hearing.

314
00:15:07,448 --> 00:15:08,282
[scoffs]

315
00:15:10,618 --> 00:15:12,995
{\an8}Well, I missed the hearing. My fault.

316
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:15,456
Oh, it just snuck up on me,
and then they called,

317
00:15:15,539 --> 00:15:17,541
and they wanted me there
at eight bells.

318
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:19,919
You know,
I thought that was their 5:00 p.m.

319
00:15:20,377 --> 00:15:24,089
By the time I got back, the courtroom
was reverted back to the crab restaurant.

320
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:27,968
Eight bells are first to a watch length.
It's maritime law. Duh, right?

321
00:15:28,177 --> 00:15:29,219
I mean, duh.

322
00:15:29,303 --> 00:15:31,388
You know, one bell is struck
after 30 minutes, two bells...

323
00:15:31,472 --> 00:15:34,141
[narrator]<i> It seems Michael had been</i>
<i>interested in maritime law</i>

324
00:15:34,224 --> 00:15:37,144
<i>since playing a lawyer alongside Buster</i>

325
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:41,398
<i>in an original school play titled</i>
The Trial of Captain Hook.

326
00:15:41,482 --> 00:15:43,484

327
00:15:45,277 --> 00:15:48,656
<i>Prior to this, his only dream had been</i>

328
00:15:49,323 --> 00:15:50,950
Watch out for the seal!

329
00:15:51,033 --> 00:15:54,286
<i>But that one turned out to be</i>
<i>not as much fun as he thought.</i>

330
00:15:55,245 --> 00:15:56,830
-Lucille!
-I'm watching!

331
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:57,957
You're out of the play!

332
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,792
That's why at sea,
a watch with no incidents

333
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:01,794
is described as
"Eight bells and all is well."

334
00:16:02,586 --> 00:16:05,130
Wow.
Maybe you should be the maritime lawyer.

335
00:16:05,673 --> 00:16:07,758
This is what I've been saying,
because I did go to law school

336
00:16:07,841 --> 00:16:09,510
with an emphasis on maritime law.

337
00:16:09,593 --> 00:16:14,056
Oh, your one year of law school
is gonna beat Barry's three tries?

338
00:16:14,181 --> 00:16:16,266
It's ridiculous. We'll hire the best.

339
00:16:16,392 --> 00:16:17,476
-[phone rings]
-[Barry] Ooh!

340
00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:20,854
This might be about my new sailor suit.
[whispers] This could help us.

341
00:16:20,938 --> 00:16:22,940
And who's gonna pay for the best, Mom?

342
00:16:23,023 --> 00:16:25,442
We have money from selling some shares
in the family company.

343
00:16:25,526 --> 00:16:27,861
<i>And that's when Michael discovered</i>

345
00:16:30,447 --> 00:16:32,074

347
00:16:35,202 --> 00:16:37,204
What are you talking about?
That money is spent.

348
00:16:37,287 --> 00:16:39,206
I just bought 4,000 acres

349
00:16:40,124 --> 00:16:42,793
-of California desert.
-Time out. Hang on.

350

-What's this?
-[George] Yeah... [clears throat]

351
00:16:45,337 --> 00:16:47,548
I'm gonna be moving there
for a little while.

352
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:50,926
Old Big Bear's not gonna
be around much anymore.

353
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:52,928
-I don't care about that.
-He's in denial.

354
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:55,014
-We're getting divorced!
-Your mother and I are getting a divorce.

[Buster shrieks]

356
00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:02,354
-I want to know--
-[Buster whimpering]

357
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:08,235
I wanna know about the stimulus package.

358
00:17:08,318 --> 00:17:11,071
We haven't had sex
since Christmas, Michael.

359
00:17:12,448 --> 00:17:16,035
I'm sorry, you had sex seven weeks ago?

360
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:17,911
They were remodeling my room,

361
00:17:17,995 --> 00:17:20,205
and I pulled my cot in there
just like camp.

362
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:21,582
We yelled at you to leave.

363
00:17:21,665 --> 00:17:23,667
But then you whispered, "Don't pull out!"

364
00:17:23,751 --> 00:17:26,211
[Gob yelling, groaning]

365
00:17:26,336 --> 00:17:28,839
You didn't wanna use
any of that money for...

[Gob moaning]

367
00:17:30,174 --> 00:17:32,676
You couldn't use any of that money
to finish Sudden Valley?

368
00:17:32,843 --> 00:17:34,303
You don't consider that finished?

369
00:17:35,929 --> 00:17:39,224
So the family got a little stimmy.
Don't make a federal case out of it.

370
00:17:39,308 --> 00:17:41,727
That is exactly what
they're going to make out of it.

371
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:42,728
When you say family,

372
00:17:42,853 --> 00:17:44,688
you mean our family have
already got their hooks in it?

373
00:17:44,772 --> 00:17:46,065
Buster, no offense.

374
00:17:46,148 --> 00:17:48,484
None taken! I keep losing my jewels.

375
00:17:48,942 --> 00:17:50,944
I'm sure Gob helped himself to the money.

376
00:17:51,195 --> 00:17:53,197
-Hey, I've got mouths to feed.
-Mouths?

377
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:54,823
Mouth.

378

Her.

379
00:17:56,784 --> 00:17:58,952
Oh, hey, mouth.
I didn't see you sitting there.

380
00:17:59,203 --> 00:18:01,205
We rode up in the elevator together.

381
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:03,540
-I'm blanking.
-Yeah.

382
00:18:03,665 --> 00:18:06,293
Me and Blank are getting
the old Christian magic act back together.

383
00:18:06,418 --> 00:18:08,712
I mean, you don't expect people
to believe that I'm Jesus

384
00:18:08,837 --> 00:18:12,466
-if I'm walking around in rags.
-You're resurrecting that mumbo-jumbo?

385
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:14,760
Look, everybody's got a gimmick.

386
00:18:15,135 --> 00:18:17,971

That's why we didn't we didn't cut you in.
We didn't wanna demean you.

It's like tipping an African-American.

404
00:19:12,025 --> 00:19:14,194
You wouldn't tip an African-American,
would you?

405
00:19:15,112 --> 00:19:16,155
Of course I would.

406
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:18,031

408
00:19:21,869 --> 00:19:23,787
No. I've been tipping them.

Mother didn't wanna trample their rights,
so she let them.

Then she realized that her son
fell off the boat

You managed to combine people's fear
of homosexuals and eels into one alibi.

Let me get this straight.

434
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:36,652
I still have to do all the work
as the president of the company,

435
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:39,613
but I can't use any of the money
for the company,

436
00:20:39,696 --> 00:20:41,573
and you won't let me help with your case,

437
00:20:41,657 --> 00:20:44,409
but you'd still like for me
to testify at your trial. Is that right?

438
00:20:44,493 --> 00:20:47,037
I just want you to say
I was a loving mother.

439
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,080
