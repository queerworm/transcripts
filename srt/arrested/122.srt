00:00:01,417 --> 00:00:02,918
- [male narrator] NOW 
THE STORY OF A WEALTHY FAMILY

2
00:00:02,918 --> 00:00:04,129
WHO LOST EVERYTHING

3
00:00:04,129 --> 00:00:06,005
AND THE ONE SON 
WHO HAD NO CHOICE

4
00:00:06,005 --> 00:00:08,091
BUT TO KEEP THEM ALL TOGETHER.

5
00:00:13,763 --> 00:00:15,848
IT'S "ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT".

6
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:21,271
- LOW-CARB DIETS 
ARE SWEEPING THE NATION,

7
00:00:21,271 --> 00:00:24,065
BUT SOME LOCAL BUSINESSES 
ARE BEING LEFT IN THE DUST.

8
00:00:24,065 --> 00:00:25,941
- AND THE LATEST ON IRAQ-- 
- HEY.

9
00:00:25,941 --> 00:00:28,278
GEORGE MICHAEL, THEY'RE GONNA 
SHOW THAT INTERVIEW YOU DID.

10
00:00:28,278 --> 00:00:29,862
WE'RE GONNA WATCH IT 
ON THURSDAY, OKAY?

11
00:00:29,862 --> 00:00:32,490
I'LL MAKE SOME POPCORN. 
- POPCORN, REALLY? COOL.

12
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:33,533
YEAH, THE HELL 
WITH ATKINS, HUH?

13
00:00:33,533 --> 00:00:35,035
- OH, YEAH.

14
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:38,371
OH, WHY BLOW IT NOW? 
I'LL FRY UP SOME BACON.

15
00:00:38,371 --> 00:00:41,499
- UH, DAD.

16
00:00:41,499 --> 00:00:43,959
- BUDDY, YOU GOTTA 
TAKE IT EASY, OKAY?

17
00:00:43,959 --> 00:00:45,920
I'M SHOWING THIS 
AS A MODEL AGAIN.

18
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:51,634
I DON'T WANT PEOPLE TO THINK 
WE'VE GOT SHODDY WORKMANSHIP.

19
00:00:51,634 --> 00:00:53,678
THAT MIGHT NOT 
HAVE BEEN YOUR FAULT.

20
00:00:53,678 --> 00:00:56,597
- I KNOW. 
NOTHING WORKS IN THIS HOUSE.

21
00:00:56,597 --> 00:00:58,558
- TELL ME ABOUT IT. 
- IS THAT A SHOT AT ME?

22
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:00,310
- PROBABLY. 
- BECAUSE FOR YOUR INFORMATION,

23
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:03,396
I GOT A JOB. 
- REALLY? WHAT KIND OF JOB?

24
00:01:03,396 --> 00:01:04,772
- BEADS.

25
00:01:04,772 --> 00:01:06,566
- BEES? 
- BEADS.

26
00:01:06,566 --> 00:01:08,025
- BEADS?

27
00:01:08,025 --> 00:01:09,444
- GOB'S NOT ON BOARD.

28
00:01:09,444 --> 00:01:10,986
- BEADS ARE VERY BIG RIGHT NOW.

29
00:01:10,986 --> 00:01:13,989
UH, ANKLETS, 
NECKLACES, YOU NAME IT.

30
00:01:13,989 --> 00:01:15,366
- BRACELETS?

31
00:01:15,366 --> 00:01:17,034
- BUT I'LL NEED 
SOME START-UP MONEY.

32
00:01:17,034 --> 00:01:19,287
- I'M IN. 
BUT WE'RE GONNA NEED A LOT.

33
00:01:19,287 --> 00:01:21,664
BEADS AREN'T CHEAP. 
ARE BEADS CHEAP?

34
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:23,958
- GOB, SHOULDN'T YOU BE IN BED?

35
00:01:23,958 --> 00:01:26,085
- WELL, WE GOT A MEETING 
WITH DAD'S ATTORNEY TODAY.

36
00:01:26,085 --> 00:01:27,628
HE'S GONNA WANT ME TO 
TAKE A LIE-DETECTOR TEST

37
00:01:27,628 --> 00:01:29,422
TO USE AS EVIDENCE 
IN DAD'S TRIAL, BUT, UH,

38
00:01:29,422 --> 00:01:30,673
I DON'T WANT TO.

39
00:01:30,673 --> 00:01:31,716
WHAT IF THEY 
ASK ABOUT A MAGIC TRICK?

40
00:01:31,716 --> 00:01:33,176
I JUST--I CAN'T RISK IT.

41
00:01:33,176 --> 00:01:34,719
- THEY'RE NOT GONNA 
ASK YOU ANYTHING.

42
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:37,138
THEY WANT ME TO 
TAKE THE POLYGRAPH TEST.

43
00:01:37,138 --> 00:01:39,724
- BUT I'M THE OLDEST.

44
00:01:39,724 --> 00:01:40,975
THE MATRIARCH, IF YOU WILL.

45
00:01:40,975 --> 00:01:42,435
- SURE. I WILL.

46
00:01:42,435 --> 00:01:44,437
LISTEN, I HAVE TO DO 
THIS TO HELP OUT DAD,

47
00:01:44,437 --> 00:01:46,147
AND YOU DON'T KNOW ANYTHING 
ABOUT OUR BUSINESS.

48
00:01:46,147 --> 00:01:47,607
- AND GOB, I'M NOT 
LOOKING FOR A PARTNER.

49
00:01:47,607 --> 00:01:49,942
AND, BELIEVE ME, 
IF I WAS, IT WOULD NOT BE YOU.

50
00:01:49,942 --> 00:01:53,028
- OH. 
GOOD.

51
00:01:53,028 --> 00:01:54,489
WELL, I'LL START 
MY OWN BUSINESS.

52
00:01:54,489 --> 00:01:55,990
HOW HARD CAN IT BE?

53
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:58,368
Z-Z-Z-Z-Z!

54
00:01:58,368 --> 00:02:00,203
BZ-Z-Z-Z-Z-Z!

55
00:02:00,203 --> 00:02:02,913
WE'LL SEE 
WHO BRINGS IN MORE HONEY.

56
00:02:02,913 --> 00:02:04,374
[buzzing]

57
00:02:04,374 --> 00:02:05,375
- HE'S THINKING 
ABOUT BEES AGAIN.

58
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:06,917
- OH.

59
00:02:06,917 --> 00:02:08,711
- LINDSEY, I'M NOT JUST GONNA 
CUT YOU A CHECK

60
00:02:08,711 --> 00:02:10,963
SO YOU CAN THROW IT AWAY ON 
ANOTHER FAILED BUSINESS, OKAY?

61
00:02:10,963 --> 00:02:11,964
- HEY, "MOMMY, WHAT WILL 
I LOOK LIKE?"

62
00:02:11,964 --> 00:02:13,216
SHOULD HAVE WORKED.

63
00:02:13,216 --> 00:02:14,384
- [narrator] 
LINDSAY HAD ONCE STARTED

64
00:02:14,384 --> 00:02:16,093
A PHOTO-ENHANCING SERVICE,

65
00:02:16,093 --> 00:02:17,887
WHICH GAVE 
NEW PARENTS A GLIMPSE

66
00:02:17,887 --> 00:02:21,599
AT WHAT THEIR INFANTS WOULD 
LOOK LIKE IN HALF A CENTURY.

67
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:23,351
- HEY, YOU PUT 
AN UGLY KID IN,

68
00:02:23,351 --> 00:02:25,770
YOU CAN'T BE SURPRISED 
WHEN AN UGLY ADULT COMES OUT.

69
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:27,772
LOOK, I NEED TO BECOME 
SELF-RELIANT.

70
00:02:27,772 --> 00:02:29,064
IT'S NOT GONNA LAST 
WITH TOBIAS.

71
00:02:29,064 --> 00:02:30,816
HE'S COMPLETELY 
OBLIVIOUS.

72
00:02:30,816 --> 00:02:33,319
I MEAN HE'S GOT NO IDEA 
HOW I'M FEELING OR THINKING.

73
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:34,987
- SO THERE'S NO SEX?

74
00:02:34,987 --> 00:02:37,365
- I MEAN, HOW DO YOU 
NOT HAVE SEX WITH ME?

75
00:02:37,365 --> 00:02:39,950
- IT IS A STRUGGLE. 
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT.

76
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:41,619
I'LL HELP YOU OUT, 
BUT YOU GOTTA WORK.

77
00:02:41,619 --> 00:02:44,289
- GREAT. BEFORE YOU KNOW IT, 
I'LL BE IN THE RED.

78
00:02:44,289 --> 00:02:46,832
AND YOU CAN TAKE 
THAT TO THE BANK.

79
00:02:46,832 --> 00:02:49,294
- I'M SURE THEY'LL 
CONTACT ME FIRST.

80
00:02:49,294 --> 00:02:50,878
- [narrator] AND THAT'S WHEN 
MICHAEL GOT A CALL

81
00:02:50,878 --> 00:02:52,255
THAT MADE HIM WISH HE HADN'T

82
00:02:52,255 --> 00:02:54,965
PROMISED HIS SISTER 
THE MONEY.

83
00:02:54,965 --> 00:02:57,176
- HELLO.

84
00:02:57,176 --> 00:02:59,178
KITTY?

85
00:02:59,178 --> 00:03:01,347
- [narrator] AND LATER, 
THE FAMILY WAITED FOR MICHAEL

86
00:03:01,347 --> 00:03:02,348
AT THE PRISON MEETING ROOM.

87
00:03:02,348 --> 00:03:03,641
- HOW DO YOU MAKE MONEY FROM IT?

88
00:03:03,641 --> 00:03:05,393
- I DON'T KNOW. 
HONEY?

89
00:03:05,393 --> 00:03:06,519
OR JUST AS GIFTS.

90
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:08,313
- WHO'D WANT A BEE AS A GIFT?

91
00:03:08,313 --> 00:03:10,898
- [narrator] WHILE BUSTER AND 
ANNYONG WAITED JUST OUTSIDE.

92
00:03:10,898 --> 00:03:12,400
- COME ON. 
JUST LET ME HAVE ONE BITE.

93
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,151
- NO. 
MOTHER SAID NO CARBOHYDRATE

94
00:03:14,151 --> 00:03:15,861
FOR YOU IF YOU EVER 
GONNA GET GIRLFRIEND

95
00:03:15,861 --> 00:03:17,196
THAT'S NOT OLD LADY.

96
00:03:17,196 --> 00:03:18,489
- AT LEAST 
I CAN GET A GIRLFRIEND.

97
00:03:18,489 --> 00:03:19,907
- I CAN GET A GIRLFRIEND 
BEFORE YOU.

98
00:03:19,907 --> 00:03:21,200
- OH, WE'LL SEE ABOUT THAT.

99
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,452
- HEY, WHY AREN'T YOU IN THERE?

100
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:25,996
- OH, I WAS JUST 
KEEPING ANNYONG COMPANY.

101
00:03:25,996 --> 00:03:27,540
GIVE ME THAT BAGEL, 
YOU LITTLE [bleep].

102
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:29,208
GIVE IT TO ME! 
[bleep]

103
00:03:29,208 --> 00:03:31,586
- WHOA, OUR STAR WITNESS. 
COME HERE.

104
00:03:31,586 --> 00:03:32,795
GOOD TO SEE YOU. 
YOU KNOW WHAT?

105
00:03:32,795 --> 00:03:34,422
DON'T GET 
TOO CLOSE TO ME,

106
00:03:34,422 --> 00:03:35,881
'CAUSE I'VE GOT AN ITCH 
YOU CAN'T BELIEVE.

107
00:03:35,881 --> 00:03:37,550
I THINK SOMETHING 
LAID EGGS ON ME.

108
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:39,385
- THANKS FOR THE HEADS-UP. 
- THAT'S OKAY.

109
00:03:39,385 --> 00:03:41,471
WE'VE GOT YOUR POLYGRAPH 
SET FOR TOMORROW.

110
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:44,765
- ABOUT THAT-- 
- I'LL TELL THEM, MICHAEL.

111
00:03:44,765 --> 00:03:48,185
I WON'T DO IT. 
I'M AFRAID OF WHAT I MIGHT KNOW.

112
00:03:48,185 --> 00:03:49,812
- YOU? 
NO ONE WANTS YOU.

113
00:03:49,812 --> 00:03:51,772
DOES ANYONE WANT HIM, HARRY? 
- WHO WOULD WANT HIM?

114
00:03:51,772 --> 00:03:53,148
- THEY DON'T WANT YOU.

115
00:03:53,148 --> 00:03:54,400
- GOOD.

116
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,985
- I MIGHT NOT BE 
THE BEST WITNESS EITHER.

117
00:03:55,985 --> 00:03:57,278
I GOT A PHONE CALL 
FROM KITTY THIS MORNING.

118
00:03:57,278 --> 00:03:58,279
- YOUR SECRETARY?

119
00:03:58,279 --> 00:03:59,780
- MY SECRETARY.

120
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:01,449
- SHE SAYS THAT SHE'S GOT 
SOME EVIDENCE,

121
00:04:01,449 --> 00:04:03,033
AND SHE'S THREATENING 
TO BRING DOWN THE COMPANY

122
00:04:03,033 --> 00:04:04,369
UNLESS WE MEET HER DEMANDS.

123
00:04:04,369 --> 00:04:06,246
- OH, THAT IS JUST GREAT.

124
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:08,789
AND NOW I'M EXPECTED 
TO CLIMB BACK ON TOP OF KITTY

125
00:04:08,789 --> 00:04:10,207
AND DO MY THING AGAIN.

126
00:04:10,207 --> 00:04:12,084
I MEAN, THIS FAMILY 
RUNS INTO PROBLEMS,

127
00:04:12,084 --> 00:04:13,669
IT'S, "OH, LET'S HAVE GOB 
[bleep] OUR WAY OUT OF IT."

128
00:04:13,669 --> 00:04:15,338
- WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH YOU?

129
00:04:15,338 --> 00:04:18,048
- COME ON. IT'S ME THAT 
SHE WANTS TO MEET WITH, GOB.

130
00:04:18,048 --> 00:04:20,551
- OH. 
GOOD.

131
00:04:20,551 --> 00:04:21,969
- NOW, WHAT DOES SHE HAVE, DAD? 
I NEED TO KNOW.

132
00:04:21,969 --> 00:04:23,388
- NO, YOU CAN'T KNOW.

133
00:04:23,388 --> 00:04:25,180
WE GOT TO KEEP YOU NICE 
AND CLEAN, MICHAEL.

134
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:27,600
ESPECIALLY IF YOU'RE GOING 
TO TAKE THAT LIE DETECTOR TEST.

135
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,226
- HE IS ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.

136
00:04:29,226 --> 00:04:31,271
- FIND OUT WHAT KITTY WANTS 
AND JUST GIVE IT TO HER,

137
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:33,648
BUT DON'T FIND 
OUT WHAT SHE KNOWS.

138
00:04:33,648 --> 00:04:37,234
MICHAEL, YOU CAN 
SAVE THIS BUSINESS.

139
00:04:37,234 --> 00:04:39,529
YOU ARE THE ONLY ONE 
WHO CAN DO IT.

140
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:41,071
- YEAH, BESIDES ME, RIGHT?

141
00:04:41,071 --> 00:04:42,907
BUT I KIND OF GOT MY HANDS 
FULL WITH THESE BABIES.

142
00:04:42,907 --> 00:04:45,242
- HE'S GOT BEES! 
- NO BEES!

143
00:04:45,242 --> 00:04:46,869
- GET IT! 
[jar rolling]

144
00:04:46,869 --> 00:04:49,789
- THEY DON'T ALLOW YOU 
TO HAVE BEES IN HERE.

145
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:51,666
- [narrator] AND BUSINESS WAS 
SLOW AT THE BANANA STAND

146
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:53,626
WHEN GEORGE MICHAEL 
MADE A NEW FRIEND.

147
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:55,252
- HI.

148
00:04:55,252 --> 00:04:56,671
- HI.

149
00:04:56,671 --> 00:04:58,506
- ARE BANANAS 
HIGH IN CARBOHYDRATES

150
00:04:58,506 --> 00:05:00,300
- OH, YOU'RE ON ATKINS TOO?

151
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,259
UH, YEAH. 
ACTUALLY, THAT'S, UM--

152
00:05:02,259 --> 00:05:03,678
THAT'S WHY 
I'M GONNA BE ON TV.

153
00:05:03,678 --> 00:05:05,262
- YOU ARE?

154
00:05:05,262 --> 00:05:07,181
- I WAS INTERVIEWED FOR 
HINDSIGHT, WITH JOHN BEARD.

155
00:05:07,181 --> 00:05:08,891
I, UH, 
I GAVE THEM A JOKE,

156
00:05:08,891 --> 00:05:10,601
BUT, I MEAN, I DON'T KNOW 
IF THEY'RE GONNA USE IT.

157
00:05:10,601 --> 00:05:12,269
YOU KNOW, 
THANKS TO THIS DIET CRAZE,

158
00:05:12,269 --> 00:05:13,521
THE LAST TIME 
WE HAD A CUSTOMER,

159
00:05:13,521 --> 00:05:15,898
THE BANANA 
STAND WAS STILL GREEN.

160
00:05:15,898 --> 00:05:18,859
- LOSE IT. 
NO, LOSE THE WHOLE KID.

161
00:05:18,859 --> 00:05:20,445
WE'LL JUST GO 
WITH THE IRAQ PIECE.

162
00:05:20,445 --> 00:05:23,072
- THAT'S SO COOL. 
- I GUESS.

163
00:05:23,072 --> 00:05:25,741
- YOU WANNA WATCH 
OVER AT MY HOUSE?

164
00:05:25,741 --> 00:05:30,079
- YEAH, I--I GUESS.

165
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:32,332
- [narrator] AND MICHAEL 
HEADED OFF TO MEET KITTY.

166
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:34,249
THEIR LAST MEETING 
HAD ENDED POORLY.

167
00:05:34,249 --> 00:05:36,919
- SAY GOOD-BYE 
TO YOUR COMPANY, MICHAEL.

168
00:05:36,919 --> 00:05:39,171
AND SAY GOOD-BYE TO THESE. 
- NO, NO, NO, NO.

169
00:05:39,171 --> 00:05:40,673
- [narrator] SO MICHAEL 
WAS UNDERSTANDABLY

170
00:05:40,673 --> 00:05:42,299
ANXIOUS ABOUT THEIR REUNION.

171
00:05:42,299 --> 00:05:44,051
- GUESS I DO GET 
TO SEE THEM AGAIN, HUH?

172
00:05:44,051 --> 00:05:45,344
[chuckles]

173
00:05:45,344 --> 00:05:47,262
- CAN WE PLEASE 
HAVE ONE CONVERSATION

174
00:05:47,262 --> 00:05:48,556
THAT'S NOT 
ABOUT MY RACK, MICHAEL?

175
00:05:48,556 --> 00:05:49,765
- YEAH.

176
00:05:49,765 --> 00:05:51,225
- MAYBE A BETTER 
QUESTION WOULD BE,

177
00:05:51,225 --> 00:05:52,977
WHAT EVIDENCE 
DO I HAVE AGAINST YOU, BECAUSE--

178
00:05:52,977 --> 00:05:55,020
- NO, NO, NO. 
I DON'T--I DON'T WANNA KNOW.

179
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:57,982
I JUST WANT TO KNOW 
WHAT YOU WANT.

180
00:05:57,982 --> 00:06:00,234
- I'D LIKE TO BE IN CHARGE 
OF THE BLUTH COMPANY.

181
00:06:00,234 --> 00:06:01,861
- WELL, I WANT 
A HAMBURGER AND FRENCH FRIES,

182
00:06:01,861 --> 00:06:03,946
BUT I CAN'T HAVE THE BUN 
OR THE POTATOES. GET REAL.

183
00:06:03,946 --> 00:06:06,031
- I DESERVE IT. 
YOUR FATHER PROMISED IT TO ME

184
00:06:06,031 --> 00:06:09,744
ON THE DAY 
HE WENT TO PRISON.

185
00:06:09,744 --> 00:06:11,537
- SOUNDS LIKE SOMETHING 
THAT HE WOULD DO.

186
00:06:11,537 --> 00:06:13,288
- AND IF I CAN'T BE IN CHARGE,

187
00:06:13,288 --> 00:06:15,416
THEN I'M GOING TO HAVE TO 
TELL THE ENTIRE WORLD

188
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:18,419
THAT YOUR FATHER WAS 
BUILDING HOUSES OVERSEAS

189
00:06:18,419 --> 00:06:19,420
WITHOUT PAYING-- 
- WHOA, WHOA, WHOA!

190
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:20,671
JUST STOP, STOP. STOP.

191
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:22,757
NO, FINISH. 
FINISH.

192
00:06:22,757 --> 00:06:25,050
UM, WITHOUT PAYING WHAT? 
TAXES?

193
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:28,178
- MODEL HOUSES, MICHAEL. 
OVERSEAS.

194
00:06:28,178 --> 00:06:32,099
AND HE HID IT--[whispering] 
FROM THE U.S. GOVERNMENT.

195
00:06:32,099 --> 00:06:33,308
- THAT'S IT? THAT'S WHAT 
MY DAD'S BEEN HIDING?

196
00:06:33,308 --> 00:06:34,727
BACK TAXES?

197
00:06:34,727 --> 00:06:36,812
- AND UNLESS YOU PLAN 
ON PAYING THEM,

198
00:06:36,812 --> 00:06:40,483
YOUR DAD'S GONNA BE 
IN PRISON FOR A LONG TIME.

199
00:06:40,483 --> 00:06:42,359
- WELL, WE'LL PAY THEM. 
FORGET IT.

200
00:06:42,359 --> 00:06:44,403
WE'LL JUST--WE'LL MORTGAGE 
THE COMPANY IF WE HAVE TO.

201
00:06:44,403 --> 00:06:46,489
WE FOUND MONEY FOR THOSE. 
WE'LL FIND MONEY FOR TAXES.

202
00:06:46,489 --> 00:06:47,698
GOOD TO SEE YA.

203
00:06:47,698 --> 00:06:49,617
- YEAH. IF I WAS IN CHARGE,

204
00:06:49,617 --> 00:06:52,369
THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN 
MY FIRST MOVE TOO.

205
00:06:52,369 --> 00:06:53,579
- [narrator] 
AS MICHAEL RETURNED HOME,

206
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:55,080
GEORGE MICHAEL 
WAS HEADING OUT

207
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:56,832
TO MEET THE GIRL 
FROM THE BANANA STAND.

208
00:06:56,832 --> 00:06:59,585
- GREAT NEWS. 
THE BUSINESS IS GONNA BE OKAY.

209
00:06:59,585 --> 00:07:01,837
YEAH, I THOUGHT BANANAS 
WOULD BE OKAY ON THE DIET.

210
00:07:01,837 --> 00:07:04,549
- NO, NO. I MEANT, WELL, 
YOU HAVEN'T BEEN EATING THOSE,

211
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:06,467
HAVE YOU? 
- NO. NO. NOT AT ALL.

212
00:07:06,467 --> 00:07:08,302
JUST SOME NUTS. 
- THOSE ARE FINE.

213
00:07:08,302 --> 00:07:10,387
WHAT I MEANT WAS, I THINK 
WE'RE GONNA BE SEEING POP-POP

214
00:07:10,387 --> 00:07:11,722
A LITTLE BIT SOONER 
THAN WE THOUGHT.

215
00:07:11,722 --> 00:07:13,974
HUH? DOES THAT SOUND GOOD?

216
00:07:13,974 --> 00:07:17,311
- DO YOU HEAR THAT RATTLE? 
- IT IS VERY WORRISOME.

217
00:07:17,311 --> 00:07:18,979
- HEY, WHAT THE HELL 
ARE YOU DOING?

218
00:07:18,979 --> 00:07:20,690
- GREAT NEWS, MICHAEL.

219
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:23,568
WE'RE THINKING OF PURCHASING 
A BLUTH MODEL HOME.

220
00:07:23,568 --> 00:07:26,487
AND LET'S CHECK THE OVEN. 
[clattering]

221
00:07:26,487 --> 00:07:28,363
- WHOA, THAT DOESN'T 
INSPIRE CONFIDENCE.

222
00:07:28,363 --> 00:07:30,616
- LINDSAY, THE BEAD BUSINESS 
TAKING OFF, IS IT?

223
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:33,035
- ACTUALLY, I AM 
THE BREADWINNER, MICHAEL,

224
00:07:33,035 --> 00:07:34,579
AS IT TURNS OUT.

225
00:07:34,579 --> 00:07:36,456
I WAS WALKING 
IN A STRANGE PLACE TODAY.

226
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:38,624
A PLACE I'D NEVER 
SET FOOT IN BEFORE.

227
00:07:38,624 --> 00:07:40,125
- [narrator] 
TOBIAS, WALKING DOWN A STREET

228
00:07:40,125 --> 00:07:41,961
HE'D BEEN DOWN 
MANY TIMES,

229
00:07:41,961 --> 00:07:45,214
SAW A BOOK HE'D WRITTEN YEARS 
EARLIER AS A PSYCHIATRIST.

230
00:07:45,214 --> 00:07:47,341
THE BOOK, 
INITIALLY UNSUCCESSFUL,

231
00:07:47,341 --> 00:07:48,968
HAD SUDDENLY CAUGHT FIRE.

232
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:52,472
ALTHOUGH, STRANGELY, 
ONLY IN THE GAY COMMUNITY.

233
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:54,223
- THE BOOK IS HUGE.

234
00:07:54,223 --> 00:07:56,767
AND I HAVE A BIT OF MONEY 
COMING MY WAY AS A RESULT.

235
00:07:56,767 --> 00:07:58,603
SO IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME, 
I'M GOING TO GO UPSTAIRS

236
00:07:58,603 --> 00:08:00,104
AND RUN THE SHOWER.

237
00:08:00,104 --> 00:08:01,731
LET ME KNOW IF IT'S TOO LOUD 
IN THE KITCHEN.

238
00:08:01,731 --> 00:08:03,774
- OKAY, HONEY.

239
00:08:03,774 --> 00:08:05,485
- SO, YOUR HUSBAND 
COMES INTO SOME MONEY,

240
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:07,653
AND SUDDENLY HE'S 
NOT SO OBLIVIOUS ANYMORE, HUH?

241
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:09,947
- HEY, NOW, THIS IS NOT ME 
BEING SHALLOW, MICHAEL.

242
00:08:09,947 --> 00:08:12,157
HE'S WRITTEN A SELF-HELP BOOK 
THAT'S HELPING PEOPLE.

243
00:08:12,157 --> 00:08:13,659
THAT DOES TAKE SOME INSIGHT.

244
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:15,327
- LISTEN, THIS BETTER NOT MEAN

245
00:08:15,327 --> 00:08:16,871
YOU'RE BLOWING OFF 
THE BEAD STORE.

246
00:08:16,871 --> 00:08:18,498
- WELL, UH, SEEING AS THOUGH 
YOU BROUGHT IT UP,

247
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:20,500
MAYBE WE SHOULD GET OUT 
OF THIS INVESTMENT.

248
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,251
I MEAN, SERIOUSLY, 
MICHAEL, BEADS?

249
00:08:22,251 --> 00:08:24,336
- I KNEW YOU'D DO THIS. 
YOU WORK FOR THREE SECONDS,

250
00:08:24,336 --> 00:08:25,337
AND YOU FIND SOMETHING 
THAT'S EASIER

251
00:08:25,337 --> 00:08:26,547
AND THEN YOU JUST GRAB IT.

252
00:08:26,547 --> 00:08:28,340
IT'S "DIP-A-PET" 
ALL OVER AGAIN.

253
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:29,842
- [narrator] 
LINDSAY ALSO HAD A BRIEF FORAY

254
00:08:29,842 --> 00:08:31,511
INTO WHAT 
SHE HAD THEN HOPED...

255
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:33,012
- COME BACK HERE! 
- WOULD BE THE BURGEONING FAD

256
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:35,180
OF CUSTOM PET COLORING.

257
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:36,641
- WELL, THAT WOULD'VE WORKED 
IF YOU'D SPRUNG

258
00:08:36,641 --> 00:08:38,267
FOR A BIGGER SINK.

259
00:08:38,267 --> 00:08:41,020
- GEORGE MICHAEL, 
OUR SHOW'S ABOUT TO START.

260
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:43,648
- HE WENT OUT ON HIS DATE. 
- A DATE?

261
00:08:43,648 --> 00:08:46,316
BUT WE HAD PLANS 
TO--A DATE WITH WHO?

262
00:08:46,316 --> 00:08:48,443
- SOME GIRL. 
I MEAN, SHE BARELY HAS A FACE.

263
00:08:48,443 --> 00:08:50,613
YOU COULDN'T PICK HER OUT 
OF A LINEUP OF ONE.

264
00:08:50,613 --> 00:08:52,782
- BUT FIRST, 
THE PALACES OF IRAQ.

265
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:54,408
TRISHA, TELL US ABOUT 
THESE NEW MINI-PALACES

266
00:08:54,408 --> 00:08:56,201
OF SADDAM'S YOU'VE DISCOVERED.

267
00:08:56,201 --> 00:08:59,288
- OUR TROOPS HAVE BEEN LIVING 
HERE FOR THE LAST FEW DAYS,

268
00:08:59,288 --> 00:09:02,875
AND, AS YOU CAN TELL, THEY'VE 
MADE THEMSELVES RIGHT AT HOME.

269
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:05,294
NOW, A LOT OF THIS DAMAGE 
IS JUST DUE

270
00:09:05,294 --> 00:09:08,548
TO SHODDY WORKMANSHIP, 
BUT THE REAL SURPRISE HERE

271
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:11,842
IS THAT THESE HOMES 
APPEAR TO BE AMERICAN-BUILT

272
00:09:11,842 --> 00:09:13,468
TO BEGIN WITH.

273
00:09:13,468 --> 00:09:15,345
- THERE HAVE BEEN SANCTIONS 
AGAINST DOING BUSINESS

274
00:09:15,345 --> 00:09:17,514
WITH HUSSEIN'S REGIME 
SINCE THE EARLY '90S,

275
00:09:17,514 --> 00:09:19,141
SO WHO BUILT THEM?

276
00:09:19,141 --> 00:09:20,935
- DOES THAT LOOK A LITTLE LIKE 
OUR KITCHEN ISLAND?

277
00:09:20,935 --> 00:09:23,437
- WELL, WHOEVER IT IS, 
THEY'RE IN A WORLD OF TROUBLE.

278
00:09:23,437 --> 00:09:25,272
- [narrator] 
AND MICHAEL REALIZED

279
00:09:25,272 --> 00:09:28,525
THAT HIS FATHER'S CRIMES MIGHT 
BE BIGGER THAN HE THOUGHT.

280
00:09:28,525 --> 00:09:30,485
- THERE'S A GOOD CHANCE 
I MAY HAVE COMMITTED

281
00:09:30,485 --> 00:09:32,988
SOME LIGHT TREASON.

282
00:09:32,988 --> 00:09:38,077
- THIS MIGHT EVEN BE 
CONSIDERED LIGHT TREASON.

283
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:39,494
- OH, MY GOD.

284
00:09:39,494 --> 00:09:41,622
[glass shattering]

285
00:09:49,338 --> 00:09:50,923
- [narrator] 
MICHAEL HAD JUST FOUND OUT

286
00:09:50,923 --> 00:09:53,342
HIS FATHER MIGHT HAVE COMMITTED 
SOME LIGHT TREASON

287
00:09:53,342 --> 00:09:55,845
BY BUILDING MODEL HOMES IN IRAQ.

288
00:09:55,845 --> 00:09:57,597
AND HE TRIED TO GET AHOLD 
OF KITTY,

289
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:59,223
WHO HE KNEW 
HAD THE EVIDENCE.

290
00:09:59,223 --> 00:10:02,392
UNFORTUNATELY, KITTY WAS 
MEETING WITH GOB AT THE TIME.

291
00:10:02,392 --> 00:10:04,561
- WHAT ABOUT HASH BROWNS? 
- NO, BECAUSE HASH BROWNS

292
00:10:04,561 --> 00:10:06,230
ARE POTATOES.

293
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:08,232
- SO YOU REALLY CAN'T 
EAT ANYTHING ON THIS DIET.

294
00:10:08,232 --> 00:10:11,526
WOW. WONDER HOW THIS IS GONNA 
AFFECT MY HONEY BUSINESS?

295
00:10:11,526 --> 00:10:14,488
- GOB, I HAVE SEEN 
YOU GET PASSED OVER

296
00:10:14,488 --> 00:10:16,699
TIME AND TIME 
AGAIN BY YOUR FAMILY.

297
00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:17,742
YOU DON'T DESERVE THAT.

298
00:10:17,742 --> 00:10:19,827
YOU'RE SMARTER THAN THEM.

299
00:10:19,827 --> 00:10:22,705
- WHAT ABOUT MACARONI? 
LET ME FINISH...

300
00:10:22,705 --> 00:10:23,914
SALAD?

301
00:10:23,914 --> 00:10:26,166
- GOB, THIS IS YOUR TIME.

302
00:10:26,166 --> 00:10:29,378
WITH MY HELP, 
KNOWING WHAT I KNOW,

303
00:10:29,378 --> 00:10:31,881
WE COULD TAKE OVER 
THE BLUTH COMPANY TOGETHER.

304
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:33,548
- WOW.

305
00:10:33,548 --> 00:10:36,426
THIS IS A SIDE OF YOU 
I'D NEVER NOTICED BEFORE.

306
00:10:36,426 --> 00:10:39,221
HAVE THEY 
ALWAYS BEEN THAT BIG?

307
00:10:39,221 --> 00:10:41,473
- [narrator] AND THE NEXT DAY, 
MICHAEL WENT TO HIS MOTHER'S.

308
00:10:41,473 --> 00:10:45,144
- I SAW AN EXPOSÉ 
ON THE IRAQ PALACES LAST NIGHT,

309
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:46,395
AND I COULD HAVE SWORN 
THAT ONE OF THEM

310
00:10:46,395 --> 00:10:48,022
WAS THE SEA WIND UNIT.

311
00:10:48,022 --> 00:10:50,482
- THAT'S FUNNY. 
I ALWAYS PICTURED IRAQ

312
00:10:50,482 --> 00:10:52,067
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DESERT.

313
00:10:52,067 --> 00:10:54,361
- DAD SOLD HOUSES 
TO THE IRAQIS, DIDN'T HE?

314
00:10:54,361 --> 00:10:55,612
AND THIS IS 
WHAT YOU KEPT FROM ME

315
00:10:55,612 --> 00:10:56,822
SO I COULD TAKE 
THE POLYGRAPH TEST.

316
00:10:56,822 --> 00:10:58,532
TELL ME THE TRUTH, OKAY?

317
00:10:58,532 --> 00:11:00,367
'CAUSE THERE'S BEEN A LOT 
OF LYING IN THIS FAMILY.

318
00:11:00,367 --> 00:11:02,036
- AND A LOT OF LOVE.

319
00:11:02,036 --> 00:11:03,287
- MORE LIES.

320
00:11:03,287 --> 00:11:05,122
- LOOK, I NEVER KNEW 
ABOUT ANYTHING,

321
00:11:05,122 --> 00:11:07,207
BUT I HAD MY SUSPICIONS.

322
00:11:07,207 --> 00:11:09,126
HE NEVER TOLD ME 
WHERE HE WAS GOING,

323
00:11:09,126 --> 00:11:11,253
BUT HE USED TO COME BACK 
FROM THOSE BUSINESS TRIPS

324
00:11:11,253 --> 00:11:13,630
REEKING OF LAMB.

325
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:15,257
AND PEOPLE WOULD SEND FIGS,

326
00:11:15,257 --> 00:11:16,258
NOT EVEN AT CHRISTMAS,

327
00:11:16,258 --> 00:11:17,718
IN THE MIDDLE OF OCTOBER.

328
00:11:17,718 --> 00:11:20,888
OH, AND ONCE, 
SOMEONE SENT HIM A TOE,

329
00:11:20,888 --> 00:11:22,932
AND HE WENT WHITE AS A SHEET.

330
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:26,268
I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT, 
MICHAEL.

331
00:11:26,268 --> 00:11:28,687
- ZERO HOUR, MICHAEL.

332
00:11:28,687 --> 00:11:30,564
IT'S THE END OF THE LINE.

333
00:11:30,564 --> 00:11:33,525
I'M THE FIRST BORN. 
SICK OF PLAYING SECOND FIDDLE.

334
00:11:33,525 --> 00:11:35,360
ALWAYS THIRD IN LINE 
FOR EVERYTHING.

335
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,946
TIRED OF FINISHING FOURTH.

336
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:39,698
BEING THE FIFTH WHEEL.

337
00:11:39,698 --> 00:11:42,159
THERE ARE SIX THINGS 
I'M MAD ABOUT.

338
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:43,911
AND I'M TAKING OVER.

339
00:11:43,911 --> 00:11:45,454
- YOU WANT TO BE IN CHARGE? 
- YEAH.

340
00:11:45,454 --> 00:11:47,081
- YOU WANT TO DEAL WITH 
WHAT I DEAL WITH.

341
00:11:47,081 --> 00:11:50,500
A SISTER WHO TAKES YOUR MONEY 
AND THROWS IT AWAY;

342
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:52,169
A MOTHER WHO YOU CAN'T TRUST;

343
00:11:52,169 --> 00:11:55,840
A COMPANY WHOSE FOUNDER 
MAY BE ON TRIAL FOR TREASON.

344
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:58,133
IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT?

345
00:11:58,133 --> 00:12:00,385
- WHAT KIND OF VACATION TIME 
DOES IT OFFER?

346
00:12:00,385 --> 00:12:03,180
- YEAH.

347
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:05,057
- [narrator] GOB REALIZED 
THAT THE POWER PLAY

348
00:12:05,057 --> 00:12:06,391
HE PROMISED 
TO MAKE WITH KITTY

349
00:12:06,391 --> 00:12:08,477
HAD PERHAPS COME AT A BAD TIME.

350
00:12:08,477 --> 00:12:10,729
- I'VE MADE A HUGE MISTAKE.

351
00:12:10,729 --> 00:12:12,439
- [narrator] AND TOBIAS WAS 
HAVING HIS FIRST BOOK READING.

352
00:12:12,439 --> 00:12:13,983
- AND, FOR THE EASE 
OF THE READER,

353
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:16,443
I HAVE CHANGED ALL 
THE GENDER-RELATED PRONOUNS:

354
00:12:16,443 --> 00:12:19,613
"HE," "SHE," 
TO THE MASCULINE "HE."

355
00:12:19,613 --> 00:12:23,868
"THE MAN INSIDE ME. 
FOR LINDSAY, MY ROCK.

356
00:12:23,868 --> 00:12:28,455
I COULD NOT HAVE 
DONE THIS WITHOUT HIM."

357
00:12:28,455 --> 00:12:30,958
- [narrator] AND LINDSAY ARRIVED 
TO SUPPORT HER HUSBAND.

358
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:32,667
"FOR THERE IS 
A MAN INSIDE ME,

359
00:12:32,667 --> 00:12:35,295
AND ONLY WHEN 
HE'S FINALLY OUT

360
00:12:35,295 --> 00:12:38,423
CAN I WALK FREE OF PAIN."

361
00:12:38,423 --> 00:12:41,468
- THIS BOOK IS GONNA 
SELL, LIKE, A BILLION COPIES.

362
00:12:41,468 --> 00:12:44,596
- LINDSAY 
OH, I'M SO GLAD YOU CAME.

363
00:12:44,596 --> 00:12:46,098
I WAS HOPING FOR MORE WOMEN.

364
00:12:46,098 --> 00:12:47,557
PERHAPS I SHOULDN'T 
HAVE JUST USED "HE."

365
00:12:47,557 --> 00:12:48,976
I THINK THAT WAS A MISTAKE.

366
00:12:48,976 --> 00:12:50,769
- [narrator] AND LINDSAY 
REALIZED THAT TOBIAS

367
00:12:50,769 --> 00:12:53,313
WAS JUST AS OBLIVIOUS 
AS SHE'D ALWAYS THOUGHT.

368
00:12:53,313 --> 00:12:55,816
- TOBIAS, I DON'T THINK THIS 
RELATIONSHIP IS GONNA WORK.

369
00:12:55,816 --> 00:12:57,067
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

370
00:12:57,067 --> 00:13:01,030
WE'VE HAD SOME GREAT TIMES.

371
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:04,408
WE'VE GOT NOTHING LEFT, TOBIAS.

372
00:13:04,408 --> 00:13:06,576
- [narrator] AND MICHAEL WENT 
TO CONFRONT HIS FATHER.

373
00:13:06,576 --> 00:13:08,620
- YOU'RE BUILDING 
HOUSES IN IRAQ?

374
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:10,122
I MEAN, DO YOU KNOW 
HOW THEY PUNISH TREASON?

375
00:13:10,122 --> 00:13:11,415
- FIRST TIME.

376
00:13:11,415 --> 00:13:12,958
- I'VE NEVER 
HEARD OF A SECOND.

377
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:15,377
- OH, I'VE GOT 
THE WORST [bleep] ATTORNEYS.

378
00:13:15,377 --> 00:13:16,711
THIS IS WHY I DIDN'T WANT 
TO GET YOU INVOLVED.

379
00:13:16,711 --> 00:13:18,338
BUT WE CAN FIX THIS.

380
00:13:18,338 --> 00:13:19,506
WHAT ARE KITTY'S DEMANDS? 
WHAT DOES SHE WANT?

381
00:13:19,506 --> 00:13:20,507
- SHE WANTS MY JOB.

382
00:13:20,507 --> 00:13:21,675
SUDDENLY EVERYBODY WANTS MY JOB,

383
00:13:21,675 --> 00:13:23,052
AND I SHOULD'VE 
GIVEN IT TO HER.

384
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:25,512
- YOU MEAN, 
YOU DIDN'T? MICHAEL!

385
00:13:25,512 --> 00:13:27,347
SHE HAS THE EVIDENCE 
OF WHAT WE DID OVER THERE.

386
00:13:27,347 --> 00:13:29,558
- NO, ALL SHE THINKS IT IS 
IS UNPAID TAXES.

387
00:13:29,558 --> 00:13:31,101
- YEAH. WHAT IF SHE 
GIVES IT TO SOMEONE

388
00:13:31,101 --> 00:13:33,020
WHO'S EVEN 
MODERATELY INTELLIGENT?

389
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:34,813
- [narrator] 
IN FACT, KITTY HAD GONE

390
00:13:34,813 --> 00:13:36,815
TO SOMEONE 
MODERATELY INTELLIGENT

391
00:13:36,815 --> 00:13:38,108
IN HER CONTINUING QUEST 
FOR CONTROL

392
00:13:38,108 --> 00:13:39,693
OF THE BLUTH COMPANY.

393
00:13:39,693 --> 00:13:41,111
- I CAN'T BELIEVE 
YOU CALLED ME FOR A DATE.

394
00:13:41,111 --> 00:13:43,113
- YOU DIDN'T 
TELL ANYONE, DID YOU?

395
00:13:43,113 --> 00:13:44,489
- ARE YOU KIDDING?

396
00:13:44,489 --> 00:13:46,575
I DON'T NEED TO BRAG

397
00:13:46,575 --> 00:13:49,870
THAT SOME PEOPLE 
HAVEN'T EVEN BEEN ON A DATE.

398
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:51,705
- DAY NOT OVER YET, FATTY.

399
00:13:51,705 --> 00:13:53,165
- YOU WEREN'T THINKING CLEARLY.

400
00:13:53,165 --> 00:13:55,000
I MEAN, NONE OF US ARE. 
WE NEED BREAD.

401
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,835
- IF THIS INFORMATION 
WAS SO DAMAGING,

402
00:13:56,835 --> 00:13:58,128
WHY DIDN'T YOU JUST SHRED IT?

403
00:13:58,128 --> 00:14:00,923
- WELL, SADDAM OWED US MONEY.

404
00:14:00,923 --> 00:14:04,051
- YOU DIDN'T REALIZE 
THAT HE WOULDN'T PAY?

405
00:14:04,051 --> 00:14:06,011
- YOUR MOM HAD 
A GOOD FEELING ABOUT HIM.

406
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:09,348
- SO MOM KNEW 
THIS ENTIRE TIME,

407
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:11,391
AND SHE JUST LIED TO MY FACE 
FOR MONTHS AND MONTHS?

408
00:14:11,391 --> 00:14:12,851
LET ME TELL YOU 
SOMETHING, DAD.

409
00:14:12,851 --> 00:14:15,145
THIS IS--THIS IS YOUR PROBLEM. 
OKAY? NOT MINE.

410
00:14:15,145 --> 00:14:16,688
- YEAH, WELL, MAYBE IT 
WOULDN'T BE MY PROBLEM

411
00:14:16,688 --> 00:14:18,983
IF YOU DID WHAT I ASKED 
FOR ONCE IN YOUR DAMN LIFE

412
00:14:18,983 --> 00:14:20,985
AND YOU GAVE KITTY 
WHAT I ASKED YOU TO.

413
00:14:20,985 --> 00:14:22,319
- ONCE IN MY DAMN LIFE?

414
00:14:22,319 --> 00:14:23,820
ALL I'VE EVER DONE 
MY ENTIRE LIFE

415
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:25,447
IS DO EXACTLY WHAT YOU 
TOLD ME TO, ALL RIGHT?

416
00:14:25,447 --> 00:14:27,491
I'VE DONE EVERYTHING 
FOR THIS FAMILY, POP.

417
00:14:27,491 --> 00:14:29,910
NOT ANYMORE. 
KITTY CAN HAVE MY JOB.

418
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:32,496
AND YOU CAN TAKE YOUR OWN 
POLYGRAPH TEST, 'CAUSE I'M DONE.

419
00:14:32,496 --> 00:14:35,124
I'M DONE WITH YOU, 
AND I'M DONE WITH THE BUSINESS.

420
00:14:35,124 --> 00:14:36,458
- GREAT.

421
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:38,127
I'M GONNA GET 
A LETHAL INJECTION

422
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:40,420
BECAUSE MY SON 
WON'T EAT A POTATO.

423
00:14:43,924 --> 00:14:46,176
- [narrator] GEORGE SENIOR, 
IN A SURPRISE MOVE

424
00:14:46,176 --> 00:14:48,137
VOLUNTEERED TO TAKE 
THE POLYGRAPH.

425
00:14:48,137 --> 00:14:50,264
- SO DID YOU SWIPE THE SEDATIVE 
FROM THE INFIRMARY?

426
00:14:50,264 --> 00:14:51,598
- NO. 
- TO LOWER YOUR HEART RATE?

427
00:14:51,598 --> 00:14:53,350
- NO. IT'S OKAY. 
I WANT TO DO THIS,

428
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:56,020
BECAUSE I WANT PEOPLE TO KNOW I 
NEVER WILLFULLY DECEIVED ANYONE.

429
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:57,729
MISTAKES WERE MADE,

430
00:14:57,729 --> 00:14:59,606
BUT I NEVER INTENDED 
TO HURT ANYONE.

431
00:14:59,606 --> 00:15:01,150
I WAS TRYING TO 
SUPPORT MY FAMILY.

432
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:02,609
- HE DOESN'T APPEAR 
TO BE ON A SEDATIVE.

433
00:15:02,609 --> 00:15:04,236
- BUT I CAN SEE CLEARLY NOW.

434
00:15:04,236 --> 00:15:05,946
SITTING IN THIS CHAIR, 
STRAPPED TO THIS MACHINE,

435
00:15:05,946 --> 00:15:09,324
I CAN SEE THAT MY LIFE 
HAS BECOME A FAILURE!

436
00:15:09,324 --> 00:15:12,369
I'VE LET PEOPLE DOWN, 
LET MYSELF DOWN.

437
00:15:12,369 --> 00:15:15,789
BUT I LOVE MY COUNTRY! 
I LOVE IT HERE!

438
00:15:15,789 --> 00:15:18,708
YOU CAN SHOP. 
I LOVE MY--CAN'T BREATHE.

439
00:15:18,708 --> 00:15:20,669
I CAN'T BREATHE.

440
00:15:20,669 --> 00:15:22,379
- WAIT! WAIT! 
ARE YOU GUILTY? YES OR NO?

441
00:15:22,379 --> 00:15:23,964
- I THINK HE'S HAVING 
A HEART ATTACK.

442
00:15:23,964 --> 00:15:25,174
- THAT WAS NOT A NOD. 
- THAT WAS NOT A NOD.

443
00:15:25,174 --> 00:15:26,883
- NO. THAT WAS NOT A NOD.

444
00:15:26,883 --> 00:15:28,427
- CALL AN AMBULANCE! 
- OH, MY GOD.

445
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:32,181
[siren wailing]

446
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:36,060
- OH, HOW IS HE? 
- STABLE.

447
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:38,020
BUT THEY DON'T KNOW 
IF HE'S DUE FOR ANOTHER ONE.

448
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:40,105
IT'S HIS OWN FAULT.

449
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:42,816
WHAT KIND OF DIET IS THIS? 
IT'S TOO MUCH MEAT.

450
00:15:42,816 --> 00:15:46,361
I WANT ALL OF YOU 
OFF THIS IMMEDIATELY.

451
00:15:46,361 --> 00:15:49,239
EXCEPT YOU.

452
00:15:49,239 --> 00:15:51,116
- TOBIAS. 
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU CAME.

453
00:15:51,116 --> 00:15:55,204
- OH, COME ON, LINDSAY. 
THIS IS MY FAMILY.

454
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:56,621
- [narrator] 
AND LINDSAY REALIZED

455
00:15:56,621 --> 00:15:58,748
THAT PERHAPS THEY DID HAVE 
SOMETHING LEFT.

456
00:15:58,748 --> 00:16:00,375
A REAL CONNECTION.

457
00:16:00,375 --> 00:16:02,752
- ALSO, DALE, ONE OF 
THE GENTLEMEN FROM MY READING,

458
00:16:02,752 --> 00:16:07,549
IS A NURSE HERE, SO WE WERE ABLE 
TO PARK RIGHT OUT FRONT.

459
00:16:07,549 --> 00:16:09,718
- OH, BARRY. 
DID YOU TALK TO A DOCTOR?

460
00:16:09,718 --> 00:16:12,346
- I DID. I HAVE POISON OAK.

461
00:16:12,346 --> 00:16:13,388
DO YOU BELIEVE IT?

462
00:16:13,388 --> 00:16:15,182
WHERE THE HELL DID I GET THAT?

463
00:16:15,182 --> 00:16:16,766
[dog barks]

464
00:16:16,766 --> 00:16:18,685
- SHE WAS TALKING ABOUT GEORGE.

465
00:16:18,685 --> 00:16:19,979
- NO, HE'S THE SAME.

466
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:21,438
LOOK, I GUESS 
WE SHOULD DECIDE

467
00:16:21,438 --> 00:16:23,273
ON WHO'S GONNA SPEAK 
FOR THE FAMILY.

468
00:16:23,273 --> 00:16:25,484
I WOULD, BUT I HAVE 
LAKER TICKETS.

469
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:27,736
[dog barks]

470
00:16:27,736 --> 00:16:29,363
- [narrator] 
BUSTER KNEW THIS WAS HIS CHANCE

471
00:16:29,363 --> 00:16:31,823
TO PUT KITTY'S 
COUP D'ETAT IN ACTION.

472
00:16:31,823 --> 00:16:33,617
HE WONDERED IF HE WAS UP FOR IT.

473
00:16:33,617 --> 00:16:37,037
- SOMEONE MIGHT HAVE TO SIGN 
THE "DO NOT RESUSCITATE" FORM.

474
00:16:37,037 --> 00:16:38,705
AND HE DECIDED HE WASN'T.

475
00:16:38,705 --> 00:16:40,207
- I NEED TO MAKE 
A TELEPHONE CALL.

476
00:16:40,207 --> 00:16:41,333
GET OUT OF SOMETHING.

477
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:43,877
- I'M IN CHARGE NOW.

478
00:16:43,877 --> 00:16:46,296
I SPEAK FOR THIS FAMILY.

479
00:16:46,296 --> 00:16:49,174
I MEAN, I COULD, 
IF YOU WANTED ME TO.

480
00:16:49,174 --> 00:16:51,051
I'D RATHER NOT, OBVIOUSLY.

481
00:16:51,051 --> 00:16:52,469
DON'T KNOW WHAT I'D SAY.

482
00:16:52,469 --> 00:16:53,845
I MEAN, WHY DO I 
HAVE TO BE THE ONE?

483
00:16:53,845 --> 00:16:55,264
I DON'T NEED THIS.

484
00:16:55,264 --> 00:16:56,390
WHY DOES THIS HAVE TO BECOME 
MY PROBLEM?

485
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:57,641
NO. I'M OUT.

486
00:16:57,641 --> 00:16:58,642
FORGET IT. 
FIND SOMEBODY ELSE.

487
00:16:58,642 --> 00:17:00,144
I'M SICK OF IT.

488
00:17:00,144 --> 00:17:02,604
I'M SICK OF DOING EVERYTHING 
FOR THIS FAMILY.

489
00:17:02,604 --> 00:17:04,023
- WHERE IS MICHAEL?

490
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:06,816
- [scoffs] TYPICAL. 
- DID SOMEBODY CALL HIM?

491
00:17:06,816 --> 00:17:08,193
- [narrator] 
IN FACT, THEY HADN'T.

492
00:17:08,193 --> 00:17:10,029
AND AT THAT MOMENT, 
HE WAS DETERMINED

493
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:12,197
TO FINALLY GET AS FAR AWAY 
FROM HIS FAMILY AS POSSIBLE.

494
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:13,573
- HEY, PAL.

495
00:17:13,573 --> 00:17:15,117
PACK YOUR BAGS. 
- WHERE ARE WE GOIN'?

496
00:17:15,117 --> 00:17:17,202
- ANYWHERE. 
JOSHUA TREE, SPACE CAMP,

497
00:17:17,202 --> 00:17:18,620
THE BASEBALL HALL OF FAME.

498
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:20,414
EVERYTHING YOU AND I 
HAVE ALWAYS WANTED TO DO

499
00:17:20,414 --> 00:17:22,624
BUT HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO BECAUSE 
OF THIS RIDICULOUS FAMILY.

500
00:17:22,624 --> 00:17:24,376
- WE'RE JUST GONNA GO? 
- YEAH.

501
00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:25,460
AND I DON'T KNOW 
IF WE'RE EVEN GONNA COME BACK.

502
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:26,586
THERE'S NOTHING KEEPING US HERE.

503
00:17:26,586 --> 00:17:28,505
- WELL, DAD,

504
00:17:28,505 --> 00:17:30,049
I LIKE IT HERE.

505
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:32,217
- WHAT THE HELL'S GOING ON 
WITH YOU LATELY?

506
00:17:32,217 --> 00:17:33,552
I WANTED TO WATCH "HINDSIGHT",

507
00:17:33,552 --> 00:17:34,969
AND YOU WEREN'T THERE.

508
00:17:34,969 --> 00:17:36,763
I WANT TO PACK UP 
AND DESERT THE FAMILY,

509
00:17:36,763 --> 00:17:38,140
AND YOU DON'T WANT TO.

510
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:40,975
IS IT THIS NEW GIRLFRIEND? 
- NO, IT--

511
00:17:40,975 --> 00:17:43,228
IT'S BECAUSE OF THE FAMILY.

512
00:17:43,228 --> 00:17:45,064
I LIKE THE FAMILY.

513
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:47,357
I MEAN, IF WE LEAVE, WHO'S GONNA 
TAKE CARE OF THESE PEOPLE?

514
00:17:47,357 --> 00:17:48,733
- I DON'T KNOW.

515
00:17:48,733 --> 00:17:50,819
THE STATE OR THE POLICE.

516
00:17:50,819 --> 00:17:52,529
MAYBE THE MAGICIANS' ALLIANCE 
WILL PICK UP SOME SLACK.

517
00:17:52,529 --> 00:17:55,031
[phone ringing] 
HEY. THAT'S GONNA BE THEM,

518
00:17:55,031 --> 00:17:56,075
AND THEY'RE 
GONNA WANT SOMETHING.

519
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:57,867
WE'RE NOT ANSWERING THAT.

520
00:17:57,867 --> 00:18:01,455
[ringing continues]

521
00:18:05,834 --> 00:18:08,170
- HELLO.

522
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:09,296
- WHERE'S GEORGE MICHAEL?

523
00:18:09,296 --> 00:18:10,630
- EXACTLY. WHERE IS HE?

524
00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:12,299
EVER SINCE HE'S BEEN DATING

525
00:18:12,299 --> 00:18:14,843
THIS ANNIE MCNO-FACE, 
HE'S BEEN BLOWING ME OFF.

526
00:18:14,843 --> 00:18:16,095
- OH, HEY. WHERE'S POP-POP?

527
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:18,097
- ROOM 212.

528
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:19,348
- [narrator] 
AND THAT'S WHEN MAEBY DECIDED

529
00:18:19,348 --> 00:18:21,100
THAT PERHAPS 
SHE COULD USE HER UNCLE

530
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,892
TO MAKE HER COUSIN JEALOUS.

531
00:18:26,813 --> 00:18:28,982
- HEY, DAD. WAIT UP.

532
00:18:28,982 --> 00:18:30,609
- THAT WAS A WASTE OF TIME.

533
00:18:34,196 --> 00:18:36,072
- [groaning] 
- HOW'S HE DOIN'?

534
00:18:36,072 --> 00:18:37,657
- HE'S HANGING IN THERE.

535
00:18:37,657 --> 00:18:39,826
HE KEEPS TRYING TO GET 
THIS I.V. OUT OF HIS ARM.

536
00:18:39,826 --> 00:18:41,120
I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY.

537
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,871
IT'S JUST GLUCOSE.

538
00:18:42,871 --> 00:18:47,167
- WE'RE ALL TRYING 
TO STAY AWAY FROM SUGAR.

539
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:48,877
- HE'S GONNA BE OKAY, RIGHT?

540
00:18:48,877 --> 00:18:51,171
- ABSOLUTELY. 
ABSOLUTELY. YOU ALL RIGHT?

541
00:18:51,171 --> 00:18:53,757
- I'LL HANDLE THIS ONE, MICHAEL.

542
00:18:53,757 --> 00:18:55,300
DON'T YOU WORRY.

543
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:56,968
IT'LL TAKE A LOT MORE 
THAN A HEART ATTACK

544
00:18:56,968 --> 00:18:59,221
TO KILL THAT OLD BEAR.

545
00:18:59,221 --> 00:19:01,556
OLD BEAR!

546
00:19:01,556 --> 00:19:04,934
HE LIKES THE HONEY.

547
00:19:04,934 --> 00:19:07,312
HE NEVER GOT A CHANCE 
TO SEE MY BEE BUSINESS TAKE OFF.

548
00:19:07,312 --> 00:19:08,897
- HEY, COME ON, NOW.

549
00:19:08,897 --> 00:19:10,940
DAD'S GONNA BE AROUND 
ANOTHER 30 YEARS, GOB.

550
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:15,028
YOUR BUSINESS, UH, MIGHT NOT.

551
00:19:15,028 --> 00:19:18,407
- YOU'RE A GOOD BROTHER, 
MICHAEL.

552
00:19:18,407 --> 00:19:21,701
HEART ATTACK 
NEVER STOP OLD BIG BEAR.

553
00:19:21,701 --> 00:19:24,454
- I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW 
WE WERE CALLING HIM BIG BEAR.

554
00:19:24,454 --> 00:19:26,456
- WE NEVER HAD A CHANCE TO!

555
00:19:26,456 --> 00:19:28,625
- HEY, HEY. COME ON, GOB.

556
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:30,919
EVERYBODY, I'M VERY SORRY, OKAY?

557
00:19:30,919 --> 00:19:32,671
I FEEL AWFUL. 
I SHOULD HAVE BEEN HERE.

558
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:34,381
I WAS THE ONE THAT WAS SUPPOSED 
TO TAKE THAT POLYGRAPH TEST,

559
00:19:34,381 --> 00:19:35,507
AND THEN I JUST TURNED ON HIM,

560
00:19:35,507 --> 00:19:36,383
AND THEN THIS HAPPENED,

561
00:19:36,383 --> 00:19:37,967
BUT NEVER AGAIN, OKAY?

562
00:19:37,967 --> 00:19:43,723
I WILL NEVER, EVER LEAVE 
THIS FAMILY, NO MATTER WHAT.

563
00:19:43,723 --> 00:19:45,975
- YOU SHOULD'VE BEEN HERE.

564
00:19:45,975 --> 00:19:47,186
- I FEEL LIKE I COVERED THAT.

565
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:48,478
- WELL, YOU DIDN'T SAY IT.

566
00:19:48,478 --> 00:19:50,397
- I FEEL AWFUL. 
I SHOULD HAVE BEEN HERE.

567
00:19:50,397 --> 00:19:51,856
MAYBE YOU'RE RIGHT. 
MAYBE I DIDN'T SAY IT.

568
00:19:51,856 --> 00:19:55,360
I SHOULD HAVE BEEN HERE.

569
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:59,864
- EXCUSE ME, MR. BLUTH. 
- HMM?

570
00:19:59,864 --> 00:20:02,409
- WE LOST HIM. 
[all gasping]

571
00:20:02,409 --> 00:20:06,496
HE JUST, UH, 
GOT AWAY FROM US. I'M SORRY.

572
00:20:06,496 --> 00:20:09,833
- UH, CAN WE GO IN THERE?

573
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:12,126
- IF YOU WANT. NOT A LOT TO SEE.

574
00:20:12,126 --> 00:20:14,504
- MAYBE NOT FOR YOU, BUT FOR US.

575
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:32,231
- [narrator] AND THAT'S WHEN 
THE FAMILY REALIZED

576
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:34,233
THAT GEORGE SR. WASN'T DEAD

577
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:38,027
BUT WAS FLEEING THE COUNTRY 
THAT HE LOVED SO VERY MUCH.

578
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:47,871
- PACK YOUR BAGS.

579
00:20:47,871 --> 00:20:50,624
- [narrator] ON THE NEXT SEASON 
OF "ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT"

580
00:20:50,624 --> 00:20:53,209
THE FAMILY GRAPPLES WITH 
THE NEWS THEY HAD JUST HEARD.

581
00:20:53,209 --> 00:20:54,711
- WHY WOULD A DOCTOR SAY 
HE'S "GONE"

582
00:20:54,711 --> 00:20:56,129
WHEN HE MEANS HE'S ESCAPED?

583
00:20:56,129 --> 00:20:57,964
- GOD, I'VE MISSED BREAD. MMM.

584
00:20:57,964 --> 00:21:01,092
- WOULDN'T YOU SAY, 
"HE LEFT OUT THE WINDOW"

585
00:21:01,092 --> 00:21:02,969
OR, "THE ROOM'S EMPTY."

586
00:21:02,969 --> 00:21:05,347
- [narrator] MAEBY'S LIFE GETS 
A LITTLE MORE COMPLICATED.

587
00:21:05,347 --> 00:21:07,015
- I MEAN, IT'S SO OBVIOUS. 
HE GAVE HIMSELF THE SHOT

588
00:21:07,015 --> 00:21:08,808
TO MAKE IT LOOK LIKE 
A HEART ATTACK.

589
00:21:08,808 --> 00:21:09,809
HOW COULD 
THEY NOT SEE THAT?

590
00:21:09,809 --> 00:21:11,144
- MAYBE WE SHOULD KISS AGAIN

591
00:21:11,144 --> 00:21:14,314
TO TEACH THEM A LESSON 
ABOUT OBVIOUS.

592
00:21:14,314 --> 00:21:17,276
- [narrator] AND KITTY 
HELPS GEORGE SENIOR ESCAPE.
