00:00:01,209 --> 00:00:02,960
male narrator: NOW THE STORY 
OF A WEALTHY FAMILY

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:03,961
WHO LOST EVERYTHING

3
00:00:03,961 --> 00:00:05,005
AND THE ONE SON

4
00:00:05,005 --> 00:00:07,923
WHO HAD NO CHOICE 
BUT TO KEEP THEM ALL TOGETHER.

5
00:00:13,596 --> 00:00:15,598
IT'S "ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT."

6
00:00:20,603 --> 00:00:23,564
MICHAEL BLUTH ALWAYS 
RODE HIS BIKE TO WORK,

7
00:00:23,564 --> 00:00:27,902
BUT THE RECENT HEAT WAVE HAD 
TAKEN SOME OF THE FUN OUT OF IT.

8
00:00:27,902 --> 00:00:29,737
IT HAD ALSO CAUSED PROBLEMS

9
00:00:29,737 --> 00:00:32,740
IN HIS PRESENTATION TO 
THE BLUTH COMPANY INVESTORS.

10
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:35,410
- THERE'S NO SCREWUPS 
WITH THE PERMITS THIS TIME?

11
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:37,370
- THE PERMITS HAVE BEEN FILED 
ABSOLUTELY ON TIME.

12
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:38,996
YOU HAVE MY WORD ON THAT.

13
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:44,627
UM, TELL YOU WHAT.

14
00:00:44,627 --> 00:00:47,338
LET ME GET 
SOME OF THIS, UH--

15
00:00:47,338 --> 00:00:49,507
WELL, AS YOU CAN-- 
THE IMPORTANT PART IS HERE.

16
00:00:49,507 --> 00:00:52,385
- BYE, YOU GUYS. 
REALLY GREAT TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

17
00:00:55,846 --> 00:00:57,932
THEY THINK YOU'RE 
FULL OF [bleep]

18
00:00:57,932 --> 00:00:59,975
I THINK IT'S THE SWEATING.

19
00:00:59,975 --> 00:01:01,394
- I'VE GOTTA GET A CAR.

20
00:01:01,394 --> 00:01:03,729
- DON'T WORRY. 
I TOLD THEM THE TRUTH.

21
00:01:03,729 --> 00:01:05,065
- THAT I RODE HERE ON A BIKE?

22
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:06,816
- THAT THE PERMITS 
WEREN'T FILED.

23
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:10,361
- BUT MY DAD FILED THE PERMITS 
BEFORE HE WENT TO JAIL.

24
00:01:10,361 --> 00:01:12,738
- HE MOST CERTAINLY DID NOT.

25
00:01:12,738 --> 00:01:15,075
- SO I JUST LIED 
TO THE INVESTORS?

26
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:17,827
- YOU MOST CERTAINLY DID. 
- THAT'S REALLY GREAT.

27
00:01:17,827 --> 00:01:19,579
NOW I GOTTA RIDE MY BIKE 
OUT TO THE PRISON

28
00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:21,206
AND TALK TO MY DAD.

29
00:01:21,206 --> 00:01:22,915
THAT'LL BE FUN 
IN 100-DEGREE HEAT.

30
00:01:22,915 --> 00:01:25,251
- WHY DON'T YOU TAKE 
YOUR DAD'S CAR?

31
00:01:25,251 --> 00:01:29,839
- NO. 
DAD WOULD NEVER GO FOR THAT.

32
00:01:29,839 --> 00:01:31,174
- NO, NO, NO, NO.

33
00:01:31,174 --> 00:01:32,633
THERE'S NO ICE CREAM 
IN THE CAR.

34
00:01:32,633 --> 00:01:34,093
- I'LL BE CAREFUL.

35
00:01:34,093 --> 00:01:37,012
ALL RIGHT, THIS IS 
WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO.

36
00:01:37,012 --> 00:01:41,226
CAREFUL, MICHAEL.

37
00:01:41,226 --> 00:01:42,768
OH.

38
00:01:46,939 --> 00:01:48,566
- WHATEVER YOU THINK. 
- YEAH.

39
00:01:48,566 --> 00:01:51,111
- BUT I DID SEE GOB 
DRIVING IT LAST WEEK.

40
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:54,322
- WAIT, HONESTLY, 
GOB'S DRIVING THE CAR?

41
00:01:54,322 --> 00:01:57,117
- I'M NOT THE LIAR.

42
00:01:57,117 --> 00:01:59,660
narrator: MICHAEL NEEDED 
HIS FATHER'S CAR,

43
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:02,037
SO HE WENT TO CONFRONT 
HIS BROTHER GOB.

44
00:02:02,037 --> 00:02:04,499
- GIVE ME A GOB. 
- GOB!

45
00:02:04,499 --> 00:02:06,709
- NO, I DIDN'T MEAN FOR YOU 
TO YELL MY NAME AT ME.

46
00:02:06,709 --> 00:02:07,710
IT'S WHAT I CALL

47
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:09,337
A DOUBLE-DIPPED BANANA 
WITH EVERYTHING ON IT.

48
00:02:09,337 --> 00:02:11,131
- HEY, I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU.

49
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:13,633
I ASKED YOU TWO WEEKS AGO 
WHETHER WE SHOULD USE DAD'S CAR,

50
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:14,925
AND YOU SAID IT 
WOULD BE BAD FORM.

51
00:02:14,925 --> 00:02:16,511
NOW I HEAR YOU'RE DRIVING IT.

52
00:02:16,511 --> 00:02:19,096
- THAT IS A LIE, 
A BOLD-FACED LIE!

53
00:02:19,096 --> 00:02:20,556
narrator: 
GOB WAS LYING.

54
00:02:20,556 --> 00:02:22,808
HE HAD BEEN DRIVING 
HIS FATHER'S CAR.

55
00:02:36,906 --> 00:02:38,283
- WHY DON'T YOU JUST TAKE

56
00:02:38,283 --> 00:02:40,201
YOUR PRECIOUS 
PORTABLE STAIRWAY VEHICLE

57
00:02:40,201 --> 00:02:42,162
YOU'RE ALWAYS TRYING 
TO CONVINCE US IS A CAR?

58
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:44,372
- YEAH, THAT WOULD BE GREAT, 
EXCEPT OUR BROTHER-IN-LAW

59
00:02:44,372 --> 00:02:46,291
LEFT IT IN 
AN AIRPORT PARKING LOT.

60
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:47,708
- FROM WHENCE IT CAME, HUH?

61
00:02:47,708 --> 00:02:49,877
narrator: IN FACT, 
TOBIAS HAD INTENDED

62
00:02:49,877 --> 00:02:51,754
TO PARK THE FAMILY'S 
ONLY VEHICLE

63
00:02:51,754 --> 00:02:53,130
AT THE AIRPORT PARKING LOT

64
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:56,259
BUT WAS WAVED ON 
TO THE TARMAC INSTEAD,

65
00:02:56,259 --> 00:03:00,971
WHERE HE FOUND A SPOT 
CLOSE TO HIS GATE.

66
00:03:00,971 --> 00:03:02,515
- HERE YOU GO, UNCLE GOB.

67
00:03:02,515 --> 00:03:03,891
I HAD TO USE TWO STICKS

68
00:03:03,891 --> 00:03:05,643
TO SUPPORT ALL 
THE EXTRA CHOCOLATE AND NUTS.

69
00:03:05,643 --> 00:03:06,811
- HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY.

70
00:03:06,811 --> 00:03:08,521
WHOA. 
TWO STICKS AND EXTRA CHOCOLATE?

71
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:10,565
IS IT MARDI GRAS? 
WHAT ARE YOU CHARGING FOR THAT?

72
00:03:10,565 --> 00:03:11,774
- HE DOESN'T LIKE 
TO DISCUSS MONEY.

73
00:03:11,774 --> 00:03:12,942
- I DON'T LIKE TO DISCUSS MONEY.

74
00:03:12,942 --> 00:03:14,277
- WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? 
YOU DON'T PAY FOR IT?

75
00:03:14,277 --> 00:03:16,612
- A BLUTH BANANA? 
NO, I HADN'T PLANNED ON IT.

76
00:03:16,612 --> 00:03:17,780
BUT I'LL TELL YOU WHAT.

77
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:19,073
IF YOU WANT TO USE MY LIKENESS

78
00:03:19,073 --> 00:03:20,741
FOR A HAMBURGLAR-TYPE 
CHARACTER,

79
00:03:20,741 --> 00:03:23,453
I'LL SIGN OFF ON THAT, 
MR. BANANA-GRABBER.

80
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:24,537
- NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

81
00:03:24,537 --> 00:03:26,914
NO MORE BANANA GRABBING. 
NO MORE CAR GRABBING.

82
00:03:26,914 --> 00:03:28,958
THROW THAT AWAY, PLEASE.

83
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:30,418
- BUT IT'S ALREADY MADE.

84
00:03:30,418 --> 00:03:34,046
- I DON'T CARE. 
NOBODY GETS IT NOW, OKAY?

85
00:03:34,046 --> 00:03:35,172
ARE YOU HAPPY?

86
00:03:35,172 --> 00:03:39,302
- MY OWN BROTHER, MICHAEL.

87
00:03:39,302 --> 00:03:41,846
MY OWN SELFISH BROTHER.

88
00:03:43,639 --> 00:03:44,932
MICHAEL.

89
00:03:44,932 --> 00:03:48,018
- ALL RIGHT.

90
00:03:48,018 --> 00:03:51,356
I DO NOT WANT YOU TO GET UPSET. 
HE DID NOT MEAN THAT.

91
00:03:51,356 --> 00:03:52,357
SOMETIMES HE SAYS--

92
00:03:52,357 --> 00:03:54,234
- SELFISH MICHAEL.

93
00:03:59,154 --> 00:04:01,657
- HE DID NOT MEAN THAT EITHER.

94
00:04:01,657 --> 00:04:03,326
narrator: MICHAEL THEN WENT 
TO HIS SISTER

95
00:04:03,326 --> 00:04:05,119
TO FIND HIS FATHER'S CAR.

96
00:04:05,119 --> 00:04:06,329
- WHAT CAR?

97
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:07,705
I DON'T KNOW WHAT 
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

98
00:04:07,705 --> 00:04:09,749
- DAD'S CAR. THE ONE YOU DIDN'T 
TELL ME THAT YOU HAD,

99
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:12,377
EVEN THOUGH I HAD TO RIDE 
MY BICYCLE TO WORK ALL WEEK.

100
00:04:12,377 --> 00:04:14,462
- OH, DAD'S CAR.

101
00:04:14,462 --> 00:04:17,715
WELL, OBVIOUSLY I'M GONNA USE IT 
IF IT'S AN EMERGENCY.

102
00:04:17,715 --> 00:04:19,300
narrator: 
LINDSAY HAD SUCH AN EMERGENCY

103
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:20,468
THREE DAYS EARLIER

104
00:04:20,468 --> 00:04:21,844
WHEN HER SALON WAS ABLE

105
00:04:21,844 --> 00:04:24,972
TO SQUEEZE HER IN 
AT THE LAST MOMENT.

106
00:04:24,972 --> 00:04:28,142
- [gasps] 
THAT COLOR'S DISCONTINUED!

107
00:04:28,142 --> 00:04:30,520
I HAVE TO GET READY 
FOR THE BACHELORETTE AUCTION.

108
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,980
- THE BACHELORETTE AUCTION? 
YOU KNOW YOU'RE MARRIED.

109
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:34,357
- YOU JUST GO TO DINNER 
WITH THE GUY.

110
00:04:34,357 --> 00:04:35,608
IT'S FOR CHARITY.

111
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:36,984
- THAT'S WHAT YOU SAID 
ABOUT POSING

112
00:04:36,984 --> 00:04:38,569
FOR THE "LADIES OF LITERACY" 
CALENDAR,

113
00:04:38,569 --> 00:04:39,570
THE ONE WITH THE PICTURES

114
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:41,281
OF ALL THE 30-YEAR-OLD WOMEN 
IN LINGERIE

115
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:44,409
WITH THEIR NIPPLES COVERED 
BY COPIES OF OLIVER TWIST.

116
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:46,452
YEAH, THAT MADE A BIG DIFFERENCE 
FOR THE YOUNG ONES.

117
00:04:46,452 --> 00:04:48,954
- IT WOULD HAVE IF IT DIDN'T 
GET BANNED FROM THE SCHOOLS.

118
00:04:48,954 --> 00:04:49,997
- COME ON, FACE IT.

119
00:04:49,997 --> 00:04:52,082
YOU DO ALL THIS CHARITY CRAP 
JUST TO STROKE YOUR EGO.

120
00:04:52,082 --> 00:04:53,876
YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW 
WHAT THE AUCTION'S FOR TONIGHT.

121
00:04:53,876 --> 00:04:58,213
- THE WETLANDS. 
- TO DO WHAT WITH THEM?

122
00:04:58,213 --> 00:04:59,924
- DRY THEM. 
- SAVE THEM.

123
00:04:59,924 --> 00:05:02,468
- FROM DRYING, WHICH IS MORE 
THAN YOU WOULD EVER DO.

124
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:05,471
YOU'RE, LIKE, THE LEAST 
CHARITABLE PERSON I KNOW.

125
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:07,723
- I DON'T DO 
ANYTHING FOR MYSELF.

126
00:05:07,723 --> 00:05:10,059
EVERYTHING THAT I DO 
IS FOR THIS FAMILY.

127
00:05:10,059 --> 00:05:11,852
- OH, YOU DON'T DO IT 
FOR US, MICHAEL.

128
00:05:11,852 --> 00:05:14,439
YOU JUST DO IT BECAUSE YOU LOVE 
BEING THE GUY IN CHARGE,

129
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:15,981
'CAUSE YOU LOVE SAYING NO,

130
00:05:15,981 --> 00:05:19,485
LIKE YOU SAID TO GOB 
WHEN HE WANTED A FROZEN BANANA,

131
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:20,986
AND EVEN AFTER 
HE GAVE YOU THE RIGHTS

132
00:05:20,986 --> 00:05:23,238
TO HIS 
MR. BANANA-GRABBER CHARACTER.

133
00:05:23,238 --> 00:05:25,825
- YOU KNOW WHAT, I WILL START 
DOING MY CHARITY WORK

134
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:26,992
WHEN YOU START DOING YOURS.

135
00:05:26,992 --> 00:05:29,579
IN THE MEANTIME, 
WHERE'S THE CAR?

136
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:31,038
- I THINK BUSTER HAS IT.

137
00:05:31,038 --> 00:05:33,248
I DON'T KNOW. 
IT'S ON THE SCHEDULE.

138
00:05:33,248 --> 00:05:36,251
- THERE IS A SCHEDULE?

139
00:05:36,251 --> 00:05:40,423
I ALWAYS TRY SO HARD 
NOT TO LOOK AT THIS THING.

140
00:05:40,423 --> 00:05:42,633
narrator: SO MICHAEL 
WENT TO FIND BUSTER.

141
00:05:42,633 --> 00:05:43,926
- WHO LET YOU IN?

142
00:05:43,926 --> 00:05:46,136
- YOUR NEW CLEANING WOMAN. 
WHAT HAPPENED TO LUZ?

143
00:05:46,136 --> 00:05:48,305
- SUPPOSEDLY, 
LUZ HAD TO TAKE HER DAUGHTER

144
00:05:48,305 --> 00:05:49,432
TO THE HOSPITAL.

145
00:05:49,432 --> 00:05:51,183
THAT'S LUPE, HER SISTER.

146
00:05:51,183 --> 00:05:52,560
- GOD, I HOPE SHE'S OKAY.

147
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,979
- SHE'S AWFUL. 
CAN BARELY WASH A DISH.

148
00:05:54,979 --> 00:05:58,608
UH-OH, SHE BETTER NOT 
WALK THROUGH HERE

149
00:05:58,608 --> 00:06:00,485
AFTER SHE'S BEEN IN THERE.

150
00:06:00,485 --> 00:06:03,278
TELL ME YOU'VE GOT 
AN EXIT STRATEGY.

151
00:06:03,278 --> 00:06:04,279
- MOTHER.

152
00:06:04,279 --> 00:06:05,698
- OH, PLEASE.

153
00:06:05,698 --> 00:06:09,952
THEY DIDN'T SNEAK INTO THIS 
COUNTRY TO BE YOUR FRIENDS.

154
00:06:09,952 --> 00:06:11,579
- WOW.

155
00:06:11,579 --> 00:06:14,457
- DON'T YOU JUDGE ME. 
YOU'RE THE SELFISH ONE.

156
00:06:14,457 --> 00:06:16,626
YOU'RE THE ONE 
WHO CHARGED HIS OWN BROTHER

157
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:18,628
FOR A BLUTH FROZEN BANANA.

158
00:06:18,628 --> 00:06:20,463
I MEAN, IT'S ONE BANANA, 
MICHAEL.

159
00:06:20,463 --> 00:06:23,257
WHAT COULD IT COST, $10?

160
00:06:23,257 --> 00:06:25,635
- YOU'VE NEVER ACTUALLY SET FOOT 
IN A SUPERMARKET, HAVE YOU?

161
00:06:25,635 --> 00:06:27,386
- I DON'T HAVE TIME FOR THIS.

162
00:06:27,386 --> 00:06:29,430
I'VE GOT TO GET READY 
FOR THE BACHELORETTE AUCTION.

163
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:30,556
- YOU'RE DOING THAT?

164
00:06:30,556 --> 00:06:32,517
YOU CAN'T POSSIBLY TELL ME THAT 
YOU CARE ABOUT THE WETLANDS.

165
00:06:32,517 --> 00:06:36,437
- I CARE ABOUT GOING FOR MORE 
MONEY THAN LUCILLE AUSTERO.

166
00:06:36,437 --> 00:06:39,440
narrator: IN FACT, LUCILLE BLUTH 
HAD MADE SURE OF THAT.

167
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,650
- LUCILLE!

168
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:43,486
- I GOT YOU TICKETS 
TO "THE PRODUCERS."

169
00:06:43,486 --> 00:06:45,279
I ALREADY SAW IT IN NEW YORK.

170
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:46,947
BUT THAT'S OF NO USE TO A WOMAN

171
00:06:46,947 --> 00:06:51,243
WHOSE VERTIGO MAKES FLYING 
A GROTESQUE MISADVENTURE.

172
00:06:51,243 --> 00:06:55,498
- YOU MUST HAVE SCRIMPED 
AND SAVED FOR THESE.

173
00:06:55,498 --> 00:06:58,042
BUT ISN'T THIS 
THE NIGHT OF THE AUCTION?

174
00:06:58,042 --> 00:06:59,418
- IS IT?

175
00:06:59,418 --> 00:07:01,045
- YOU SEEM PRETTY CONFIDENT.

176
00:07:01,045 --> 00:07:02,922
- OH, I THINK THERE'S 
A CERTAIN BACHELOR

177
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:05,716
WHO WON'T MIND COMING HOME WITH 
ME AT THE END OF THE EVENING.

178
00:07:05,716 --> 00:07:09,386
- BUSTER? 
- WHERE DID HE GO?

179
00:07:09,386 --> 00:07:11,556
BUSTER!

180
00:07:11,556 --> 00:07:14,559
WHY DO YOU HIDE 
EVERY TIME THE DOORBELL RINGS?

181
00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:15,643
- I'M NOT HIDING.

182
00:07:15,643 --> 00:07:18,020
narrator: BUSTER WAS HIDING 
FROM LUCILLE AUSTERO.

183
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:20,481
AFTER INADVERTENTLY FLIRTING 
WITH HER AT A SOCIAL EVENT

184
00:07:20,481 --> 00:07:22,107
WHILE NOT WEARING HIS GLASSES,

185
00:07:22,107 --> 00:07:24,569
LUCILLE HAD BEEN 
PURSUING HIM EVER SINCE.

186
00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:26,654
- BUSTER, HI. 
IT'S ME AGAIN.

187
00:07:26,654 --> 00:07:27,655
- [gasping]

188
00:07:27,655 --> 00:07:29,198
I'VE STILL GOT THOSE 
"PRODUCERS" TICKETS,

189
00:07:29,198 --> 00:07:31,534
AND I'D LOVE 
TO SHARE THEM WITH YOU.

190
00:07:31,534 --> 00:07:32,827
I DON'T WANT YOU TO THINK

191
00:07:32,827 --> 00:07:36,121
I'M TAKING THIS MORE 
SERIOUSLY THAN YOU ARE,

192
00:07:36,121 --> 00:07:39,917
AND UNLESS YOU'RE PLANNING 
SOME GRAND ROMANTIC GESTURE,

193
00:07:39,917 --> 00:07:44,213
MY FEELINGS ARE JUST 
THE TEENSIEST BIT HURT.

194
00:07:44,213 --> 00:07:45,465
- WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO?

195
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:46,466
- BID ON YOU.

196
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:48,008
- HOW MUCH? 
- $10,000.

197
00:07:48,008 --> 00:07:50,260
- WHEN? 
- WHEN THEY CALL MY NAME.

198
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:52,262
- NO, THEY'RE NOT 
GOING TO CALL YOUR NAME.

199
00:07:52,262 --> 00:07:53,973
THEY'RE GOING TO CALL MY NAME.

200
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:58,060
[sighs] 
GOOD GRIEF.

201
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:01,689
- HEY, BUSTY. 
YOU BEEN USING DAD'S CAR?

202
00:08:01,689 --> 00:08:04,274
- NO. 
UH, WELL, YES.

203
00:08:04,274 --> 00:08:05,818
- YOU GOT THE KEYS?

204
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:08,028
- UH, PROBABLY 
IN MY SCHOOL PANTS

205
00:08:08,028 --> 00:08:09,154
- OKAY.

206
00:08:09,154 --> 00:08:11,949
- I HAVE BEEN A PART OF 
THIS ARCHEOLOGICAL DIG.

207
00:08:11,949 --> 00:08:14,368
I THINK WE FOUND A PART 
OF A PTERODACTYL

208
00:08:14,368 --> 00:08:15,828
UNDER FASHION ISLAND.

209
00:08:15,828 --> 00:08:19,373
- BE CAREFUL. 
[gasps]

210
00:08:19,373 --> 00:08:21,709
- OH...

211
00:08:21,709 --> 00:08:24,211
THAT--THAT WAS 90% GRAVITY.

212
00:08:24,211 --> 00:08:27,047
IT IS MY DAY ON THE SCHEDULE, 
BUT I GUESS YOU GET THEM FIRST.

213
00:08:27,047 --> 00:08:28,382
- YEAH.

214
00:08:28,382 --> 00:08:31,301
- WAIT, I NEED 
MY RAPE WHISTLE BACK.

215
00:08:31,301 --> 00:08:32,928
- YOU GOT ALL YOUR STUFF 
OUT OF THE CAR?

216
00:08:32,928 --> 00:08:35,389
- YEAH, I LEFT MY, UM, HOMEWORK 
IN THE BACKSEAT,

217
00:08:35,389 --> 00:08:36,390
BUT I CAN GET IT LATER.

218
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:37,474
- OKAY. 
- OKAY.

219
00:08:37,474 --> 00:08:38,726
[whistle blows]

220
00:08:38,726 --> 00:08:40,603
[chuckles] 
HELP.

221
00:08:40,603 --> 00:08:42,271
narrator: 
MICHAEL SURVEYED THE DAMAGE

222
00:08:42,271 --> 00:08:43,898
TO HIS FATHER'S CAR--

223
00:08:43,898 --> 00:08:47,902
THE PARTIALLY EXCAVATED SKULL, 
THE SPILLED NAIL POLISH,

224
00:08:47,902 --> 00:08:49,612
THE BURNED SEATS--

225
00:08:49,612 --> 00:08:51,656
AND HE CAME TO 
AN IMPORTANT DECISION.

226
00:08:51,656 --> 00:08:53,032
- WELL, I'M GETTING 
SOME ICE CREAM.

227
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:55,034
I CAN TELL YOU THAT RIGHT NOW.

228
00:08:57,244 --> 00:08:59,580
narrator: MICHAEL, NOW ABLE 
TO DRIVE TO PRISON,

229
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:01,582
CONFRONTED HIS FATHER 
ABOUT THE PERMITS.

230
00:09:01,582 --> 00:09:04,168
- HOW COME YOU DIDN'T TELL ME 
THAT YOU DIDN'T FILE THEM?

231
00:09:04,168 --> 00:09:05,920
- I'M UNDER A LOT OF PRESSURE.

232
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,838
I'M TRYING TO GET MY NEWSLETTER 
OFF THE GROUND,

233
00:09:07,838 --> 00:09:11,634
AND I'M TRYING TO DECIDE 
WHICH GANG TO ALIGN MYSELF WITH.

234
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:13,010
- IS IT PLEDGE WEEK ALREADY?

235
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:14,679
- I'VE GOT IT DOWN TO TWO,

236
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:16,556
BUT, HONESTLY, I JUST 
DON'T EVEN WANT TO CHOOSE.

237
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:18,432
I JUST FEEL--

238
00:09:18,432 --> 00:09:21,393
I FEEL LIKE THE PRETTIEST GIRL 
AT THE DANCE.

239
00:09:21,393 --> 00:09:23,729
LISTEN, ABOUT THAT PERMIT THING, 
THAT'S AN EASY FIX.

240
00:09:23,729 --> 00:09:25,272
JUST BREAK 
INTO THE PERMIT OFFICE,

241
00:09:25,272 --> 00:09:27,191
SLIP THE APPLICATION 
INTO THE NEXT FILE,

242
00:09:27,191 --> 00:09:29,569
THEN YOU TELL THEM, YOU KNOW, 
"HEY, YOU GUYS SCREWED UP."

243
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:31,320
- I'M NOT DOING THAT, DAD.

244
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,363
- MICHAEL, YOU LIED 
TO YOUR INVESTORS.

245
00:09:33,363 --> 00:09:35,115
YOU GOTTA MAKE THAT RIGHT.

246
00:09:35,115 --> 00:09:37,326
CALL GOB. 
HE'LL HANDLE IT.

247
00:09:37,326 --> 00:09:39,620
THAT'S WHAT-- 
THAT'S WHAT HE'S FOR.

248
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:41,288
- THAT'S WHAT HE'S FOR.

249
00:09:41,288 --> 00:09:42,873
- YOU BETTER TELL HIM 
I'M ASKING.

250
00:09:42,873 --> 00:09:44,291
I DON'T THINK HE'S 
GONNA DO IT FOR YOU

251
00:09:44,291 --> 00:09:46,586
AFTER YOU WOULDN'T EVEN GIVE HIM 
A FROZEN BANANA, MICHAEL?

252
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:48,545
- WHAT IS THERE, 
A CHAT ROOM THAT YOU GUYS--

253
00:09:48,545 --> 00:09:49,546
- THAT IS NOT CHARITABLE.

254
00:09:49,546 --> 00:09:50,547
- NEVER MIND.

255
00:09:50,547 --> 00:09:51,841
I'LL TELL GOB THAT 
YOU WANT HIM TO DO THIS.

256
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:53,676
- OKAY, I GOT A DANCE 
I GOTTA GET READY FOR.

257
00:09:53,676 --> 00:09:55,595
- WHOA, THERE'S REALLY A DANCE?

258
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:56,929
- I DON'T KNOW.

259
00:09:56,929 --> 00:09:59,264
BOTH SIDES ARE MAKING 
A LOT OF PROMISES.

260
00:10:04,436 --> 00:10:08,107
- YOU SHOULD CALL THIS 
A GOB, GUY.

261
00:10:08,107 --> 00:10:11,401
[crunching and cracking]

262
00:10:11,401 --> 00:10:15,155
- GOB, CAN I TALK 
TO YOU FOR A SEC?

263
00:10:15,155 --> 00:10:18,450
LISTEN, UM, I'M REALLY SORRY 
ABOUT BEFORE.

264
00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:22,079
I SAID SOME THINGS, 
AND I GOT A LITTLE CARRIED AWAY.

265
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:24,164
IT'S NOT THE WAY YOU'RE 
SUPPOSED TO TREAT A BROTHER,

266
00:10:24,164 --> 00:10:28,085
ESPECIALLY ONE 
THAT I VALUE SO HIGHLY.

267
00:10:28,085 --> 00:10:30,295
OH, I NEED A FAVOR.

268
00:10:30,295 --> 00:10:31,797
- THAT WAS SUBTLE. 
[whistle]

269
00:10:31,797 --> 00:10:33,633
- DID YOU JUST WHISTLE?

270
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:35,760
- I HAD TO BUY A CANDIED APPLE 
WHEN YOU DENIED ME A BANANA,

271
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,219
SO, YEAH, I'M WHISTLING. 
SATISFIED?

272
00:10:37,219 --> 00:10:40,597
IT'S NOT THAT NOTICEABLE. 
LISTEN.

273
00:10:40,597 --> 00:10:46,020
DAD WOULD LIKE FOR YOU 
TO BREAK INTO THE PERMIT OFFICE.

274
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:47,730
- DAD? 
DAD SAID HE WANTED ME FOR THAT?

275
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:48,731
- YES, HE DID.

276
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:50,065
WILL YOU DO IT?

277
00:10:50,065 --> 00:10:54,611
- MAYBE. 
I HAVE SOME CONDITIONS.

278
00:10:54,611 --> 00:10:55,821
[whistling] 
TERMS.

279
00:10:55,821 --> 00:10:56,864
- BOY.

280
00:10:56,864 --> 00:10:58,157
- ONE CONDITION AND ONE TERM.

281
00:10:58,157 --> 00:10:59,158
- ALL RIGHT.

282
00:10:59,158 --> 00:11:00,284
LET'S HAVE 
THE CONDITION FIRST.

283
00:11:00,284 --> 00:11:01,535
- FREE BANANA WHENEVER I WANT.

284
00:11:01,535 --> 00:11:02,536
- SINGLE DIP.

285
00:11:02,536 --> 00:11:04,288
- DOUBLE DIP, 
BUT I'LL TAKE ONE STICK.

286
00:11:04,288 --> 00:11:05,455
- ALL RIGHT. WHAT ELSE?

287
00:11:05,455 --> 00:11:07,624
- CREATIVE CONTROL, 
SPIN-OFF RIGHTS,

288
00:11:07,624 --> 00:11:09,043
AND THEME PARK APPROVAL

289
00:11:09,043 --> 00:11:11,420
FOR MR. BANANA-GRABBER, 
BABY BANANA-GRABBER,

290
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:13,547
AND ANY OTHER 
BANANA-GRABBER FAMILY CHARACTER

291
00:11:13,547 --> 00:11:14,799
THAT MIGHT EMANATE THEREFROM.

292
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:16,341
- I RETAIN ANIMATION RIGHTS,

293
00:11:16,341 --> 00:11:17,843
AND WE'RE GONNA 
GO BACK TO SINGLE DIP.

294
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:19,428
- DONE. 
- GREAT. WHAT ELSE?

295
00:11:19,428 --> 00:11:21,596
- YOU HUMILIATED ME 
IN FRONT OF MY NEPHEW.

296
00:11:21,596 --> 00:11:23,640
I EXPECT YOU TO FIX THAT.

297
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:26,685
I WANT THE RESPECT 
OF YOUR SON.

298
00:11:26,685 --> 00:11:28,687
- YOU BETTER LET ME 
DO THE TALKING.

299
00:11:28,687 --> 00:11:31,857
GEORGE MICHAEL, 
YOUR UNCLE HAS A REQUEST.

300
00:11:31,857 --> 00:11:34,401
- ONE BLUTH BANANA, 
GEORGE MICHAEL.

301
00:11:34,401 --> 00:11:35,820
- GO AHEAD, GIVE IT TO HIM.

302
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:38,113
GOB DESERVES YOUR RESPECT, 
AND FROM NOW ON,

303
00:11:38,113 --> 00:11:41,700
I WANT YOU TO DO WHATEVER 
HE ASKS YOU TO DO, OKAY?

304
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:43,243
AFTER ALL, HE IS YOUR UNCLE,

305
00:11:43,243 --> 00:11:48,332
AND I THINK WE OUGHT 
TO JUST EMBRACE THAT.

306
00:11:48,332 --> 00:11:50,292
- THANK YOU.

307
00:11:50,292 --> 00:11:52,127
- HAVE I HELD UP 
MY END OF THE DEAL?

308
00:11:52,127 --> 00:11:54,004
- I CAN'T BELIEVE I GAVE YOU 
ANIMATION RIGHTS.

309
00:11:54,004 --> 00:11:57,174
MAN, I HOPE THAT DOESN'T COME 
BACK AND BITE ME IN THE ASS.

I'M GONNA NEED A TAXI.

I DON'T KNOW IF THAT SMELL

SOMETHING YOU ATE,

I'VE GOT A POKER THING, 
AND I'M GONNA CLEAN THEM UP.

322
00:12:25,535 --> 00:12:28,413
SO THE NEXT TIME YOU WANNA 
TELL ME THAT I'M UNCHARITABLE,

323
00:12:28,413 --> 00:12:29,832
WHY DON'T YOU JUST 
ASK YOURSELF

324
00:12:29,832 --> 00:12:31,541
WHO CALLED YOU 
FROM THE WETLANDS?

325
00:12:31,541 --> 00:12:32,751
- WHO IS THIS?

326
00:12:32,751 --> 00:12:34,586
- NICE TRY. 
YOU'RE THE SELFISH ONE.

327
00:12:34,586 --> 00:12:40,300
NOW, IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME, 
I'VE GOT SOME NATURE TO SAVE.

00:12:47,057 --> 00:12:48,767

00:12:52,562 --> 00:12:55,524
HIS MOTHER'S FILL-IN HOUSEKEEPER 
AT A BUS STOP.

335
00:12:55,524 --> 00:12:56,775
- HELLO THERE.

336
00:12:56,775 --> 00:12:58,193
YOU'RE NOT RIDING THE BUS TODAY.

337
00:12:58,193 --> 00:12:59,569
GET IN THIS CAR.

338
00:12:59,569 --> 00:13:00,905
I'M NOT TAKING NO 
FOR AN ANSWER--COME ON.

339
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:01,906
DON'T MAKE ME GET OUT 
OF THIS CAR

340
00:13:01,906 --> 00:13:03,282
AND PUT YOU IN HERE MYSELF.

341
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:05,242
narrator: UNFORTUNATELY, 
THE WOMAN HE PICKED UP

342
00:13:05,242 --> 00:13:08,078
WASN'T LUPE, 
BUT WAS A TOTAL STRANGER.

343
00:13:08,078 --> 00:13:10,622
AND UPON SEEING BONES, 
A SHOVEL,

344
00:13:10,622 --> 00:13:13,583
AND WHAT 
APPEARED TO BE BLOOD,

345
00:13:13,583 --> 00:13:17,546
SHE REALIZED HE WASN'T 
WHO SHE THOUGHT HE WAS.

346
00:13:17,546 --> 00:13:21,050
- MISTER, PLEASE. 
[speaking Spanish]

347
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:24,053
- THIS IS GONNA BE TRICKY. 
I DON'T SPEAK SPANISH.

348
00:13:24,053 --> 00:13:26,721
- YO "ESCARED."

349
00:13:26,721 --> 00:13:29,558
- "IZQUIERDO." 
I KNOW THAT ONE.

350
00:13:29,558 --> 00:13:34,729
LEFT TURN IT IS, MRS.-- 
THEY CALL ME SELFISH.

351
00:13:36,648 --> 00:13:37,942
narrator: MICHAEL THOUGHT 
HE WAS HELPING

352
00:13:37,942 --> 00:13:39,318
HIS MOTHER'S HOUSEKEEPER,

353
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:40,777
BUT HE HAD THE WRONG WOMAN.

354
00:13:40,777 --> 00:13:42,654
- I GUESS IT WOULD JUST 
BE A GUY WHO,

355
00:13:42,654 --> 00:13:44,448
YOU KNOW, 
GRABS BANANAS AND RUNS...

356
00:13:44,448 --> 00:13:47,952
OR, UH, A BANANA 
THAT GRABS THINGS.

357
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:49,328
I DON'T KNOW.

358
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:50,913
WHY WOULD A BANANA 
GRAB ANOTHER BANANA?

359
00:13:50,913 --> 00:13:52,998
THOSE ARE THE KIND OF QUESTIONS 
I DON'T WANNA ANSWER.

360
00:13:52,998 --> 00:13:56,793
[phone ringing]

361
00:13:56,793 --> 00:13:58,170
HELLO.

362
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:00,505
- OH, MICHAEL, 
IT'S SO BEAUTIFUL HERE.

363
00:14:00,505 --> 00:14:02,507
YOU HAVE TO COME DOWN 
AND SEE THIS.

364
00:14:02,507 --> 00:14:04,051
- WELL, I'M A LITTLE BUSY 
RIGHT NOW.

365
00:14:04,051 --> 00:14:05,970
I'VE GOT SOMEONE ELSE 
IN THE CAR WITH ME,

366
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:10,807
AND I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE 
UNTIL SHE'S TAKEN CARE OF.

367
00:14:10,807 --> 00:14:13,435
- LOOK, I SCREWED UP, OKAY?

368
00:14:13,435 --> 00:14:16,730
I'M LOST, AND I HATE THEM. 
I HATE THE WETLANDS.

369
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:20,234
THEY'RE STUPID AND WET, 
AND THERE ARE BUGS EVERYWHERE.

370
00:14:20,234 --> 00:14:22,486
AND I THINK I MACED A CRANE, 
MICHAEL.

371
00:14:22,486 --> 00:14:26,698
LOOK, YOU'VE GOT DAD'S CAR. 
WHY DON'T YOU COME PICK ME UP?

372
00:14:26,698 --> 00:14:30,870
- CRAZY. 
LOCO.

373
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:33,538
LISTEN, WE GOTTA MAKE 
A LITTLE DETOUR, OKAY?

374
00:14:33,538 --> 00:14:36,625
SO I HOPE NO ONE'S 
WAITING FOR YOU.

375
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:39,294
narrator: IN FACT, THE WOMAN 
MICHAEL THOUGHT WAS LUPE

376
00:14:39,294 --> 00:14:40,921
DID HAVE PEOPLE 
WAITING FOR HER...

377
00:14:40,921 --> 00:14:42,047
[sirens wailing]

378
00:14:42,047 --> 00:14:46,510
AND THEY HAD 
REPORTED HER MISSING.

379
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:48,095
THE REAL LUPE, HOWEVER,

380
00:14:48,095 --> 00:14:49,804
WAS LEAVING LUCILLE'S 
FOR THE EVENING.

381
00:14:49,804 --> 00:14:52,807
- OH! 
BUSTER, I--

382
00:14:52,807 --> 00:14:55,102
OH. 
HELLO.

383
00:14:55,102 --> 00:14:57,479
IT APPEARS MY 
ONE-TIME ADMIRER

384
00:14:57,479 --> 00:15:01,984
IS NOT PLANNING SOME GRAND 
ROMANTIC GESTURE AFTER ALL.

385
00:15:01,984 --> 00:15:05,320
[chuckles] YOU KNOW WHAT? 
IT'S HIS LOSS.

386
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:07,031
IT'S HIS LOSS.

387
00:15:07,031 --> 00:15:08,908
IT'S HIS LOSS!

388
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:10,034
narrator: 
GOB, MEANWHILE,

389
00:15:10,034 --> 00:15:12,411
WAS CASING THE PERMIT OFFICE,

390
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:14,579
FOLLOWING THE FIRST RULE 
OF SURVEILLANCE--

391
00:15:14,579 --> 00:15:15,747
NEVER GET NOTICED.

392
00:15:15,747 --> 00:15:17,082
- CARRIER EXPRESS. 
[whistles]

393
00:15:17,082 --> 00:15:19,668
[dog barking]

394
00:15:19,668 --> 00:15:21,503
- SAY, YOU'RE NOT 
OUR REGULAR GUY.

395
00:15:21,503 --> 00:15:23,838
- NO, I'M THE SUBSTITUTE. 
[whistles]

396
00:15:23,838 --> 00:15:25,590
- HEY, GARY, 
GET A PICTURE OF ME

397
00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:27,592
WITH THE NEW 
WHISTLING DELIVERY GUY.

398
00:15:27,592 --> 00:15:30,845
narrator: GOB REALIZED 
HE NEEDED A NEW PLAN.

399
00:15:30,845 --> 00:15:32,847
- SO I NEED YOU TO GIVE 
YOUR FATHER A MESSAGE FOR ME.

400
00:15:32,847 --> 00:15:34,183
ALL RIGHT. YOU HEARD MY DAD.

401
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:35,850
I HAVE TO DO WHATEVER 
YOU ASK ME TO.

402
00:15:35,850 --> 00:15:38,187
RIGHT. 
I FORGOT ABOUT THAT.

403
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:40,230
ALL RIGHT, TAKE THIS 
LOCK-PICK SET,

404
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:41,941
BREAK INTO 
THE PERMIT OFFICE FOR ME.

405
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:43,775
- NO, I THINK I BETTER CHECK 
WITH MY DAD FIRST.

406
00:15:43,775 --> 00:15:45,027
WELL--

407
00:15:45,027 --> 00:15:46,570
- YOU'RE GONNA BREAK INTO 
A PERMIT OFFICE?

408
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:47,904
SWEET. CAN I COME?

409
00:15:47,904 --> 00:15:49,531
narrator: 
AND GEORGE MICHAEL SAW A CHANCE

410
00:15:49,531 --> 00:15:50,950
TO GET CLOSER TO MAEBY.

411
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:52,534
- YOU KNOW, MY DAD HATES 
TO MICROMANAGE.

412
00:15:52,534 --> 00:15:55,829
LET'S JUST DO THIS.

413
00:15:55,829 --> 00:15:57,331
narrator: 
AND BACK AT THE WETLANDS,

414
00:15:57,331 --> 00:15:59,374
LINDSAY FINALLY FOUND HER TAXI.

415
00:15:59,374 --> 00:16:03,462
- OH, GOOD LORD. 
YOU SMELL WORSE THAN BEFORE.

416
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:05,047
OH, MY GOD. 
IT'S ME!

417
00:16:05,047 --> 00:16:07,466
narrator: AND IN HER HASTE 
TO LEAVE THE WETLANDS,

418
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:11,761
SHE FORGOT TO CALL MICHAEL.

419
00:16:11,761 --> 00:16:13,930
- HEY. 
HEY! STAY THERE.

420
00:16:13,930 --> 00:16:15,349
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

421
00:16:15,349 --> 00:16:17,726
GET IN THE CAR. 
DON'T MOVE.

422
00:16:17,726 --> 00:16:21,230
LINDSAY! LINDS!

423
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:23,398
COME ON. 
I'M TIRED OF LOOKING.

424
00:16:23,398 --> 00:16:25,567
SHE'S NOT HERE.

425
00:16:25,567 --> 00:16:29,029
SHE PROBABLY NEVER WAS HERE. 
SHE SET ME UP.

426
00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:30,739
THIS IS PROBABLY 
ALL ABOUT THE CAR.

427
00:16:30,739 --> 00:16:32,366
I'M GONNA KILL HER!

428
00:16:32,366 --> 00:16:37,162
HEY! WHERE ARE YOU GOING? 
HELLO!

429
00:16:37,162 --> 00:16:41,291
I'M TRYING TO HELP YOU.

430
00:16:41,291 --> 00:16:43,502
YOU'RE WELCOME.

431
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:45,295
narrator: MEANWHILE, 
GOB MET WITH HIS FATHER

432
00:16:45,295 --> 00:16:47,464
TO DISCUSS 
THE PERMIT OFFICE BREAK-IN.

433
00:16:47,464 --> 00:16:49,049
SO I SAY TO MICHAEL,

434
00:16:49,049 --> 00:16:51,635
"IF IT'S SO IMPORTANT TO DAD-- 
[whistling]

435
00:16:51,635 --> 00:16:53,887
I'LL LOOK PAST YOUR SELFISHNESS 
AND DO IT."

436
00:16:53,887 --> 00:16:55,514
- THERE'S A DENTIST IN HERE

437
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:58,225
WHO, UH, TOOK LIBERTIES 
WITH HIS PATIENTS.

438
00:16:58,225 --> 00:17:01,478
I'M GONNA ASK HIM TO LOOK AT 
WHATEVER IS HAPPENING WITH YOU.

439
00:17:01,478 --> 00:17:02,771
- THANKS, POP.

440
00:17:02,771 --> 00:17:04,564
HEY, MY STOCK IS NEVER 
GONNA BE HIGHER

441
00:17:04,564 --> 00:17:06,066
WITH HIS 
GANG THAN IT IS RIGHT NOW.

442
00:17:06,066 --> 00:17:08,902
- YEAH, SO HAVE YOU, 
UH, MADE A DECISION OR--

443
00:17:08,902 --> 00:17:10,529
- [sighs] 
I DON'T KNOW.

444
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:12,114
I THOUGHT I HAD IT DOWN TO TWO,

445
00:17:12,114 --> 00:17:16,368
BUT THEN THE HAITIANS 
MADE THIS BEAUTIFUL PITCH.

446
00:17:16,368 --> 00:17:19,371
SO, UH, ANY TROUBLE 
AT THE, UH, PERMIT OFFICE?

447
00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:20,580
- NO, NO, NO, NO, 
NO, NO, NO, NO.

448
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:22,041
- EASY.

449
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:24,084
- I DELEGATED, 
JUST LIKE YOU TAUGHT ME.

450
00:17:24,084 --> 00:17:25,169
- WHO'D YOU GET?

451
00:17:25,169 --> 00:17:27,421
- GEORGE MICHAEL.

452
00:17:27,421 --> 00:17:29,839
- MY GRANDSON? 
- YEAH.

453
00:17:29,839 --> 00:17:32,759
- YOU GOT MY 14-YEAR-OLD 
GRANDSON TO DO THIS.

454
00:17:32,759 --> 00:17:34,844
- UNDER 18, 
WALKS OUT CLEAN.

455
00:17:34,844 --> 00:17:37,681
- LISTEN, UM,

456
00:17:37,681 --> 00:17:41,560
THERE'S A VERY STRICT 
"NO TOUCHING" POLICY HERE, BUT--

457
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:45,064
OH, WHAT THE HELL, IT'S WORTH 
A WEEK IN THE HOTBOX.

458
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:46,065
- NO TOUCHING!

459
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:48,983
- YOU STUPID ASS.

460
00:17:48,983 --> 00:17:50,860
narrator: AND GEORGE MICHAEL 
WAS SUCCESSFUL

461
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:52,654
WITH THE LOCK PICK 
GOB HAD GIVEN HIM.

462
00:17:52,654 --> 00:17:53,863
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

463
00:17:53,863 --> 00:17:55,365
WE'RE SUPPOSED TO PUT THE FORM 
IN THE WRONG FILE.

464
00:17:55,365 --> 00:17:57,534
- I KNOW; I'M JUST 
LEAVING MY CALLING CARD.

465
00:17:57,534 --> 00:17:59,369
- I THOUGHT WE DIDN'T WANT 
ANYONE TO KNOW WE WERE HERE.

466
00:17:59,369 --> 00:18:02,038
- IT'S A LITTLE LATE FOR THAT. 
OUR FINGERPRINTS ARE EVERYWHERE.

467
00:18:02,038 --> 00:18:03,998
- YOU SAID THEY WEREN'T 
GONNA CHECK FOR FINGERPRINTS.

468
00:18:03,998 --> 00:18:05,875
- NO, I SAID DON'T 
WEAR YOUR MITTENS.

469
00:18:05,875 --> 00:18:08,253
I DIDN'T WANT YOU TO LOOK STUPID 
ON THE SECURITY CAMERA.

470
00:18:08,253 --> 00:18:09,713
- THERE'S A SECURITY CAMERA?

471
00:18:09,713 --> 00:18:11,090
- SECURITY BREACH.

472
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:12,757
- SOMEONE'S COMING. 
WHAT DO WE DO?

473
00:18:12,757 --> 00:18:15,927
- I DON'T KNOW. 
I ALWAYS GET CAUGHT.

474
00:18:15,927 --> 00:18:17,804
- SAVE YOURSELF. 
I'LL TAKE THE HIT.

475
00:18:17,804 --> 00:18:19,639
MY RECORD'S CLEAN.

476
00:18:19,639 --> 00:18:21,100
WELL, I GOT MY BIKE SEAT 
STOLEN ONCE,

477
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,434
BUT I DON'T THINK IT COUNTS 
ON YOUR RECORD

478
00:18:22,434 --> 00:18:23,477
IF YOU'RE THE VICTIM.

479
00:18:23,477 --> 00:18:25,520
THERE IS A RECORD OF THIS, 
BUT IT'S NOT LIKE I'M--

480
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:26,813
- THANKS, I'LL TAKE THE RAP

481
00:18:26,813 --> 00:18:30,275
NEXT TIME WE DO 
SOMETHING LIKE THIS, OKAY?

482
00:18:30,275 --> 00:18:31,693
- NEXT TIME.

483
00:18:31,693 --> 00:18:34,946
[door opens] 
- HOLD IT!

484
00:18:34,946 --> 00:18:36,156
narrator: 
AND LINDSAY MADE IT

485
00:18:36,156 --> 00:18:39,451
TO THE SAVE THE WETLANDS AUCTION 
WITH MOMENTS TO SPARE.

486
00:18:39,451 --> 00:18:41,620
- OH, HONEY.

487
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:44,998
YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO SHOW UP 
AS THE WETLANDS.

488
00:18:44,998 --> 00:18:46,875
narrator: WHILE LUCILLE 
WAS WAITING FOR BUSTER

489
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:48,585
TO SHOW UP AND BID ON HER,

490
00:18:48,585 --> 00:18:50,879
BUSTER WAS WAITING FOR 
THE OTHER LUCILLE TO LEAVE

491
00:18:50,879 --> 00:18:53,132
FOR WHAT HE ASSUMED 
WAS "THE PRODUCERS,"

492
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:57,427
BUT WAS NOW, IN FACT, 
THE BACHELORETTE AUCTION.

493
00:18:57,427 --> 00:19:00,222
AND LINDSAY WAS FINALLY 
UP FOR AUCTION,

494
00:19:00,222 --> 00:19:02,474
WHICH MICHAEL ARRIVED 
JUST IN TIME TO SEE.

495
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:05,977
WHAT DO I HEAR 
FOR LINDSAY BLUTH?

496
00:19:05,977 --> 00:19:07,437
GENTLEMEN, IT'S A GOOD CAUSE.

497
00:19:07,437 --> 00:19:09,356
narrator: AND AS MICHAEL 
LOOKED AT HIS SISTER,

498
00:19:09,356 --> 00:19:11,275
UNCERTAIN WHETHER 
HER FACE WAS RED
