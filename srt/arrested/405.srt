You know, your acting career,

60
00:02:33,112 --> 00:02:35,697
this marriage
that everyone thinks is a sham

61

because you're gay.

62
00:02:36,865 --> 00:02:38,492
I-I'm sorry.

63
00:02:38,533 --> 00:02:41,703
Everyone thinks I'm gay?

64
00:02:41,745 --> 00:02:46,125
Well, I mean, it's kind of
a running joke in the family.

65
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:48,961
I mean, y-you know that, right?

66
00:02:49,003 --> 00:02:51,254
'Cause of the misleading way
you talk sometimes.

68

69
00:02:55,884 --> 00:02:58,428

♪ It's just a fallacy! ♪

71
00:03:01,222 --> 00:03:04,059
...leading? Is this because
I want to be an actor,

72
00:03:04,101 --> 00:03:05,769
and all the leading men
in Hollywood are gay?

73
00:03:05,811 --> 00:03:07,604
I don't think
that all the leading men

74
00:03:07,646 --> 00:03:08,689

75
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:10,231
-Oh, honey.
-(sighs)

76
00:03:10,273 --> 00:03:12,943
Look, we're chasing things
that aren't real.

77
00:03:12,985 --> 00:03:15,696
Maybe we need to go out there
and find out

78
00:03:15,737 --> 00:03:17,280
what we're meant to do.

79
00:03:17,322 --> 00:03:20,784
<i>His wife was giving him</i>
<i>the cold shoulder.</i>

80
00:03:20,826 --> 00:03:22,410
<i>And after kissing it good-bye,</i>

81
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:26,331
<i>he sat with her family,</i>
<i>feeling lost...</i>

82
00:03:26,373 --> 00:03:29,208
Well, you look like I feel.

83
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:31,128
<i>...and very misunderstood.</i>

84
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:32,546
Gay?

85
00:03:32,587 --> 00:03:34,631
No, I...

86
00:03:34,673 --> 00:03:36,050
No.

87
00:03:36,091 --> 00:03:38,677
<i>Tobias knew</i>
<i>it was time to find out</i>

88
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:39,887
<i>what he was truly meant to do.</i>

89
00:03:39,928 --> 00:03:42,014
<i>So when he came across a book</i>

90
00:03:42,056 --> 00:03:44,265
<i>the universe</i>
<i>had placed in his path,</i>

91
00:03:44,307 --> 00:03:45,600
<i>he was open to its inspiration.</i>

92
00:03:45,642 --> 00:03:47,728
Oh, they're still reading,
but...

93
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:49,980
well, I guess I can
leave them some love.

94
00:03:50,022 --> 00:03:52,024
<i>So he just took</i>
<i>"eat" and "pray."</i>

95
00:03:54,026 --> 00:03:55,610
<i>"Eat" was easy,</i>

96
00:03:55,652 --> 00:03:58,989
<i>although it provided</i>
<i>no cosmic answers for him.</i>

97
00:03:59,031 --> 00:04:02,201
<i>But it was the part about India</i>
<i>that really got to him.</i>

98
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:04,703
<i>And so, like the heroine</i>
<i>of</i> Eat, Pray,

99
00:04:04,745 --> 00:04:06,621
<i>-Tobias decided</i> 
-Wait a minute.

100
00:04:06,663 --> 00:04:09,750
<i>to get as far away</i>
<i>from his wife as possible.</i>

101
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:16,381
And so Tobias found himself
booking passage to India.

102
00:04:16,423 --> 00:04:19,176
<i>And soon, he discovered</i>
<i>his wife was also</i>

103
00:04:19,218 --> 00:04:21,136
<i>preparing to go somewhere...</i>

104
00:04:21,178 --> 00:04:23,097
-I think you have<i> my</i> suitcase.
<i>-...far away.</i>

105
00:04:23,138 --> 00:04:25,099
(sighs)
I'm so sorry, Tobias.

106
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:26,433
Look, I've already packed.

107
00:04:26,474 --> 00:04:27,434
Can I just use this one?

108
00:04:27,475 --> 00:04:29,269
Oh, what the heck.

109
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:32,564
I guess having matching luggage
isn't so romantic anymore.

110
00:04:32,606 --> 00:04:34,233
And these romantic gestures are

111
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:36,902
possibly why people think
I'm a homosexual.

112
00:04:36,944 --> 00:04:40,697
Well, it's time to correct
old misconceptions.

113
00:04:40,739 --> 00:04:43,117
And that is why
I'm making a new start.

114
00:04:43,158 --> 00:04:45,535
Oh, a new start.

115
00:04:45,577 --> 00:04:48,080
Filled with compassion and love.

116
00:04:48,122 --> 00:04:49,456
I like that.

117
00:04:49,497 --> 00:04:50,874
Well, I've already got
the license plate,

118
00:04:50,916 --> 00:04:52,000
so go cry in your pie!

119
00:04:52,042 --> 00:04:54,211
<i>And so Tobias, hoping to</i>

120
00:04:54,253 --> 00:04:58,339
<i>"straighten out" his image,</i>
<i>set out on a new start,</i>

121
00:04:58,381 --> 00:05:01,676
<i>beginning with a trip</i>
<i>to the airport in an outfit</i>

122
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:03,971
<i>he pretty much put together</i>
<i>himself.</i>

123
00:05:04,012 --> 00:05:05,680
Well, I guess this is why

124
00:05:05,722 --> 00:05:07,141
you never see them
driving convertibles.

125
00:05:07,182 --> 00:05:08,642
<i>I'll have to check on that one.</i>

126
00:05:08,683 --> 00:05:10,727
<i>But it certainly</i>
<i>wasn't embraced...</i>

127
00:05:10,769 --> 00:05:12,104
Stay in your lane, anus tart!

128
00:05:12,146 --> 00:05:13,480
(bleep) anus tart!

129
00:05:13,521 --> 00:05:14,898
<i>...by the local</i>
<i>Indian community.</i>

130
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:16,316
You have the true sense
of the oneness of all.

131
00:05:16,357 --> 00:05:18,944
<i>And his quest</i>
<i>hit a bump early on,</i>

132
00:05:18,986 --> 00:05:22,197
<i>as he struggled to learn</i>
<i>the customs and gestures of</i>

133
00:05:22,239 --> 00:05:24,199
<i>-the culture he hoped to adopt.</i>
-Oh, goddamn it!

134
00:05:24,241 --> 00:05:27,286
Am I the only one
who still dresses to fly?

135
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:29,537
Well, there we go.

136
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:30,914
India clean.

137
00:05:30,956 --> 00:05:32,332
(chuckles)

138
00:05:32,373 --> 00:05:33,959
Now, how did I...

139
00:05:34,001 --> 00:05:35,252
No. No.

140
00:05:35,294 --> 00:05:37,587
<i>Unfortunately,</i>

00:05:41,133 --> 00:05:43,010
I look like one of those

<i>...without the aid of Pradeep,</i>
<i>the helpful Indian salesman...</i>

145
00:05:46,263 --> 00:05:48,431
I feel like there was
less up top.

146
00:05:48,473 --> 00:05:51,392
<i>...at Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond, who</i>
<i>helped him learn how to tie it.</i>

148
00:05:52,936 --> 00:05:54,313
(choking)

149
00:05:56,231 --> 00:05:57,774
Yes, I actually
like this better.

150
00:05:57,816 --> 00:05:59,276
-(knocking)
-Yes?

151
00:06:01,695 --> 00:06:03,071
Canadian?

152
00:06:03,113 --> 00:06:04,739
No, I'm American.

153
00:06:04,781 --> 00:06:06,867
Oh, yeah. I'm Canadian.

154
00:06:06,908 --> 00:06:08,243
Oh. Sorry.

155
00:06:08,285 --> 00:06:10,162
<i>But because it was</i>
<i>a long flight,</i>

156
00:06:10,204 --> 00:06:12,873

<i>and watch something to</i>

WOMAN (over P.A.): Do not leave

Oh, dear, Lord, it's... hot!

168
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:41,818
<i>...in India, yes, where he was</i>
<i>very uncomfortable.</i>

169
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:44,112
<i>Not only because</i>

<i>when stepping into the street.</i>

173
00:06:50,409 --> 00:06:51,619
(tires screeching)

174
00:06:51,661 --> 00:06:53,705
<i>And so Tobias experienced India</i>

175
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:55,707
<i>from the inside</i>
<i>of a hospital room,</i>

176
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:57,209
<i>where the staff</i>
<i>was being trained...</i>

177
00:06:57,251 --> 00:06:59,169
This man here broke his skull
in two places.

178
00:06:59,211 --> 00:07:01,462
<i>...by the same doctor</i>
<i>he'd had in America.</i>

179
00:07:01,504 --> 00:07:03,631
Once outside the airport
and once in the elevator

180
00:07:03,673 --> 00:07:06,425
when his sheet got caught and
he was pulled off his gurney.

181
00:07:06,467 --> 00:07:07,594
<i>Literally.</i>

182
00:07:07,635 --> 00:07:08,887
-(laughter)
-Two places indeed.

183
00:07:08,929 --> 00:07:10,513
This is very funny.

184
00:07:10,555 --> 00:07:12,307
It's like that new show
we just caught,<i> Laugh-In.</i>

185
00:07:12,349 --> 00:07:13,641
My name is...

186
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:15,269
Oh!

187
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:18,605
Now I've broken my skull
in a third place!

188
00:07:18,646 --> 00:07:21,275
On this elephant guy statue!

189
00:07:21,316 --> 00:07:23,985
<i>Tobias had wanted the universe</i>
<i>to provide him a sign.</i>

190
00:07:24,027 --> 00:07:25,737
You should be a comedy actor.

191
00:07:25,779 --> 00:07:27,906
<i>And finally it had.</i>

192
00:07:27,948 --> 00:07:29,950
This is the sign I've been...
(groans)

193
00:07:29,991 --> 00:07:32,160
<i>Looking for.</i>

194
00:07:32,202 --> 00:07:34,079
<i>And after two more weeks</i>
<i>in the hospital,</i>

195
00:07:34,121 --> 00:07:36,290
<i>it was time</i>
<i>for his flight home.</i>

196
00:07:36,331 --> 00:07:38,208
<i>And that's when he got</i>
<i>another sign.</i>

197
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:40,168
(cell phone ringing)

198
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:42,754
<i>A call from Lindsay.</i>

199
00:07:42,796 --> 00:07:44,547
<i>Although he wouldn't be able</i>
<i>to reach the phone for hours...</i>

200
00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:46,258
I'm ready to make this work.

201
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:48,593
<i>...due to his already</i>
<i>weakened spine.</i>

202
00:07:48,635 --> 00:07:49,928
(bell chimes)

203
00:07:52,306 --> 00:07:53,807
NARRATOR:
<i>Tobias and Lindsay</i>

204
00:07:53,848 --> 00:07:55,683
<i>shared the news</i>
<i>of their new start</i>

205
00:07:55,725 --> 00:07:57,102
<i>at a family gathering.</i>

206
00:07:57,144 --> 00:07:58,770
I got the part.

207
00:07:58,812 --> 00:08:00,981
You know, it's funny,
for I, too, find that

208
00:08:01,022 --> 00:08:02,399
I am on a journey.

209
00:08:02,441 --> 00:08:03,733
Although, as we discovered

210
00:08:03,775 --> 00:08:05,652
when our MasterCard bill
came back,

211
00:08:05,693 --> 00:08:07,237
it was the same one she took.

212
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:09,072
But mine has confirmed
that I should

213
00:08:09,114 --> 00:08:11,491
redouble my efforts to achieve

214
00:08:11,532 --> 00:08:15,454
the unachievable dream
of being an actor.

215
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:18,290
A journey
that has left me eager

216
00:08:18,332 --> 00:08:21,960
to connect with my true love.

217
00:08:22,002 --> 00:08:24,212
Particularly if she finds her...

218
00:08:24,254 --> 00:08:26,965
way clear to covering
a 2,000-rupee

219
00:08:27,007 --> 00:08:30,135
City of Hopelessness
hospital debt.

220
00:08:30,177 --> 00:08:32,304
The trick is going to be
getting anyone to believe

221
00:08:32,346 --> 00:08:33,596
that her husband
is straight enough

222
00:08:33,638 --> 00:08:35,515
to have a true love
that's a woman.

223
00:08:35,556 --> 00:08:37,267
What are you implying?

224
00:08:37,309 --> 00:08:39,311
Oh, I don't think there was
any implying going on at all.

225
00:08:39,353 --> 00:08:40,520
Didn't hear any implying.

226
00:08:40,561 --> 00:08:41,729
I wasn't implying.

227
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:43,106
I'm sorry, Mother.

228
00:08:43,148 --> 00:08:44,691
It's just, I've got
a bit of a stick

229
00:08:44,732 --> 00:08:46,193
up my "bunghole"
about what I've now found

230
00:08:46,234 --> 00:08:47,652
is a running joke about me.

231
00:08:47,694 --> 00:08:49,488
But let's be honest.

232
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:53,116
For 2,000 rupees, we'd both
go down on Matthew McConaughey.

233
00:08:53,158 --> 00:08:54,993
(chuckles):
Yes, Michael?

234
00:08:55,035 --> 00:08:57,037
<i>At the time of this</i>
<i>family meeting,</i>

235
00:08:57,078 --> 00:08:58,246
<i>2,000 rupees was $36.</i>

236
00:08:58,288 --> 00:09:00,207
I wouldn't.

237
00:09:00,248 --> 00:09:02,292
GEORGE SR.:
Of course you wouldn't, Michael.

238
00:09:02,334 --> 00:09:04,294
You never accept help
from anyone.

239
00:09:04,336 --> 00:09:06,587
<i>And hoping to do things</i>
<i>differently this time,</i>

240
00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:09,466
<i>Lindsay immediately started</i>
<i>spending money she didn't have.</i>

241
00:09:09,508 --> 00:09:11,092
JAMES:
<i>Are you ready to make a move?</i>

242
00:09:11,134 --> 00:09:15,722
As you can see,
I'm ready for a lot that's new.

243
00:09:15,763 --> 00:09:17,224
Oh, good heavens.

244
00:09:17,265 --> 00:09:19,226
<i>While Tobias pursued</i>

245
00:09:19,267 --> 00:09:21,228
<i>the life of</i>
<i>a professional actor.</i>

246
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:23,271
Listen, I'm an actor,
you're an agent.

247
00:09:23,313 --> 00:09:24,398
You do the math.

248
00:09:24,439 --> 00:09:25,899
I want you to represent me.

249
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:28,109
In other words,
you do the math--

250
00:09:28,151 --> 00:09:29,528
the money, the negotiating.

251
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:31,612
You know I'm not
that kind of agent, right?

252
00:09:31,654 --> 00:09:33,240
I'm a real estate agent.

253
00:09:33,281 --> 00:09:35,992
I'm a predator; I sell
giant houses to very poor people

254
00:09:36,034 --> 00:09:37,744
who can't afford them
with predatory loans.

255
00:09:37,785 --> 00:09:39,704
No, see, that's the money stuff
I don't understand.

256
00:09:39,746 --> 00:09:41,622
All you need to do
is tell people

257
00:09:41,664 --> 00:09:43,708
what a terrific actor I am,
'cause I can't do it believably.

258
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:45,085
What do you say?

259
00:09:45,126 --> 00:09:46,836
Sounds like it shouldn't be
too much work.

260
00:09:46,878 --> 00:09:48,004
(laughs):
Huzzah!

261
00:09:48,046 --> 00:09:49,256
Okay, here's the number

262
00:09:49,297 --> 00:09:51,299
of my current agent
Mike Matthews.

263
00:09:51,341 --> 00:09:54,386
He's at Allstate. Fire him.

264
00:09:54,428 --> 00:09:58,390
<i>Tobias started seeing positive</i>

Lindsay, get the scooper!

278
00:10:26,543 --> 00:10:27,877
Throw oranges at it.

279
00:10:27,919 --> 00:10:29,837
-Hot orange! Hot orange.
-(duck quacking)

280
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:31,131
All right...

281
00:10:31,172 --> 00:10:32,757
It's throwing its voice!

-MAEBY: Oh!
-TOBIAS: Lindsay!

283
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:37,596
<i>And so they went</i>

<i>-his lack of auditions...</i> 
-Tobias Funke.

<i>or even the writers' strike</i>

288

<i>couldn't deter Tobias</i>

<i>the suicide of his ruined</i>

290
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:54,028
<i>and despondent agent</i>
<i>certainly could.</i>

291
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:58,325
I believe he died as a warning,
in a way, his message perhaps

292
00:10:58,366 --> 00:11:00,368
to live within our means

293
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:03,204
and be realistic
about our lives.

294
00:11:03,246 --> 00:11:04,789
<i>And yet it didn't.</i>

295
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:07,250
Well, then I shall
redouble my efforts

296
00:11:07,292 --> 00:11:10,128
-so that he died in vain.
-(others gasp)

297

(stammers)

298
00:11:12,506 --> 00:11:14,215
Meaning he will have led
a pointless life,

299
00:11:14,257 --> 00:11:15,342
is what I mean.

300
00:11:15,383 --> 00:11:16,635
Yes, carry on. Thank you.

301
00:11:16,675 --> 00:11:18,052
<i>And he soon found himself</i>

302
00:11:18,094 --> 00:11:21,473

If everyone's good,
you'll get your juice.

309
00:11:34,777 --> 00:11:36,613
<i>And Tobias found himself</i>
<i>captivated</i>

<i>by one of the monologues.</i>

311
00:11:38,323 --> 00:11:40,992
And I made it in that movie,
the<i> Fantastic Four,</i>

312
00:11:41,034 --> 00:11:43,870
uh, but it wasn't fantastic
for me.

313
00:11:43,911 --> 00:11:45,830
Uh, I got carried away.

314
00:11:45,872 --> 00:11:48,416
And I'm like,
"This (bleep) is (bleep) up,

Okay, notes:

323
00:12:04,474 --> 00:12:06,601
um, first of all, it seemed
you were slurring a bit there,

324
00:12:06,643 --> 00:12:09,103

I can't believe you saw me.

342
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,233
Well, I-I thought it was
"fantastic."

343
00:12:55,275 --> 00:12:57,318
<i>Actually, most</i>
<i>of the performance</i>

344
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,903
<i>that had so captivated</i>
<i>Tobias...</i>

345
00:12:58,945 --> 00:13:00,697
Hey, maybe she came into
this Light Bulbs Unlimited.

346
00:13:00,739 --> 00:13:02,365
She was here a minute ago.

347
00:13:02,407 --> 00:13:04,451
<i>...was performed</i>
<i>by a fishing line.</i>

348
00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:06,703
This is the gayest
Starbucks ever!

349
00:13:06,745 --> 00:13:08,747
Did his fishing line break, too?

350
00:13:08,787 --> 00:13:11,207
DeBRIE:
<i>Well, my acting career is over.</i>

351
00:13:11,249 --> 00:13:14,502
Oh, don't say that. You've got
to say, "Keep the dream alive."

352
00:13:14,544 --> 00:13:15,920
That's what helps me.

353
00:13:15,962 --> 00:13:17,796
Well, this is what's helping me.

354
00:13:17,838 --> 00:13:19,924
-Oh.
-It's really good.

355
00:13:19,966 --> 00:13:21,968
Carl Weathers used to give us
grape juice.

356
00:13:22,009 --> 00:13:24,429
But then he'd add five dollars
to our credit card.

357
00:13:24,471 --> 00:13:26,805
Well, here is to
our acting addiction.

358
00:13:26,847 --> 00:13:27,806
Yep.

359
00:13:27,848 --> 00:13:29,850
May we never be cured.

360
00:13:29,892 --> 00:13:32,145
Are you crying? Oh, I'm crying.

361
00:13:32,186 --> 00:13:34,855
Oh, it's a nosebleed.

362
00:13:34,897 --> 00:13:36,399
(DeBrie gasping)

363
00:13:36,441 --> 00:13:38,652
Oh, thank you so much.

364
00:13:38,693 --> 00:13:40,779
<i>Tobias had found a friend.</i>

365
00:13:40,819 --> 00:13:42,322
-You're neat!
-You're neat.

366
00:13:42,363 --> 00:13:43,740
(laughing):
You're neat.

367
00:13:43,782 --> 00:13:45,241
You're neat.

368
00:13:48,035 --> 00:13:49,912
NARRATOR:<i> And after a</i>
<i>not-very-cute meet-cute,</i>

369
00:13:49,954 --> 00:13:52,457
<i>Tobias continued to find</i>
<i>DeBrie's behavior delightful,</i>

370
00:13:52,499 --> 00:13:54,459
<i>even when the methadone</i>
<i>made her think</i>

371
00:13:54,501 --> 00:13:57,462
<i>she was a piece of toast.</i>

372
00:13:57,504 --> 00:13:59,464
There, now I can see

373
00:13:59,506 --> 00:14:02,425
a pretty face under all that
butter substitute.

374
00:14:02,467 --> 00:14:04,511
And I recognize you
from somewhere,

375
00:14:04,552 --> 00:14:08,222
but it's not the<i> Fantastic Four;</i>
it's from somewhere else.

376
00:14:08,264 --> 00:14:10,684
I've done some things
I'm not proud of.

377
00:14:10,725 --> 00:14:12,268
Episodics? Been there.

378
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:15,229
<i>It wasn't episodic.</i>

379
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:16,773
<i>She had been in a series</i>

380
00:14:16,815 --> 00:14:18,232
<i>of soft-core porn movies</i>
<i>about women</i>

381
00:14:18,274 --> 00:14:20,067
<i>leading straight men</i>
<i>into gay sex,</i>

382
00:14:20,109 --> 00:14:22,320
<i>-called</i> Straight Bait.
-This is my brother. He's gay.

383
00:14:22,362 --> 00:14:23,904
If you want to have sex with me,

384
00:14:23,946 --> 00:14:25,948
then you've got to have sex
with him first.

385
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:29,327
And if you don't want to have
sex with her, you must be gay.

386
00:14:29,369 --> 00:14:31,538
I'll show you how not gay I am.

387
00:14:34,457 --> 00:14:36,501
<i>She did six of these movies,</i>

388
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:39,462
<i>and after lunch,</i>
<i>did three more.</i>

389
00:14:39,504 --> 00:14:41,214
It's nice to be
recognized though.

390
00:14:41,255 --> 00:14:43,007
Marky Bark--
sometimes he doesn't know

391
00:14:43,049 --> 00:14:45,092
when I'm in the same room.

392
00:14:45,134 --> 00:14:46,469
And sometimes it feels like

393
00:14:46,511 --> 00:14:48,012
it's not the face blindness,
you know?

394
00:14:48,054 --> 00:14:50,014
It's the same
with me and Lindsay.

395
00:14:50,056 --> 00:14:52,392
I know she's trying,
but she doesn't believe

396
00:14:52,433 --> 00:14:54,394
in my acting career.

397
00:14:54,435 --> 00:14:57,146
Maybe she's right. I've yet
to make more money as an actor

398
00:14:57,188 --> 00:14:59,190
than I ever did as a doctor.

399
00:14:59,232 --> 00:15:01,025
And that's with
Country-Wide behind me.

400
00:15:01,067 --> 00:15:03,236
You're... wait, you're a doctor?
You can write scripts?

401
00:15:03,277 --> 00:15:05,196
Well, I like to think so.

402
00:15:05,238 --> 00:15:08,575
You should never give up a dream
if you can write scripts.

403
00:15:08,616 --> 00:15:11,578
You seem like you'd be
a good doctor/actor.

404
00:15:11,619 --> 00:15:13,913
<i>It was the first</i>
<i>positive reinforcement</i>

405
00:15:13,954 --> 00:15:16,040
<i>Tobias had had since India.</i>

406
00:15:16,082 --> 00:15:19,669
You remind me of
Billy Crystal... Mmm, mmm!

407
00:15:19,711 --> 00:15:22,380
<i>It would have broken</i>
<i>Tobias's heart if he knew</i>

408
00:15:22,422 --> 00:15:24,549
<i>she was about to say</i>
<i>"Billy Crystal Meth,"</i>

409
00:15:24,591 --> 00:15:26,008
<i>a funny drug dealer.</i>

410
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:29,554
Uh, I... got a bit carried away

411
00:15:29,596 --> 00:15:31,848
when you compared me
to Billy Crystal.

412
00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:34,392
You remind me
of Billy Crystal...

413
00:15:34,434 --> 00:15:37,978
<i>Once again, she was going</i>
<i>to say "Billy Crystal Meth."</i>

414
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:40,732
I'm sorry, but, DeBrie,
I-I've never met anyone

415
00:15:40,774 --> 00:15:42,609
who understands me like you do.

416
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:44,819
-Or at all.
-Maybe, with someone like you,

417
00:15:44,861 --> 00:15:46,487
I could have a new start.

418
00:15:46,529 --> 00:15:49,949
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

419
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:53,661
Did you see my license plate--
"A-N-U-S-T-A-R-T"?

420
00:15:53,703 --> 00:15:56,247
Whoa. Whoa.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

421
00:15:56,289 --> 00:16:00,000
Did you see my<i> Straight Bait</i>
movie of the same name?

422
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:02,378
(singsong):
Coincidence.

423
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:03,922
We should be together.

424
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:05,339
We should run away.

425
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:06,758
(stammering)

426
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,050
Oh, my gosh.

427
00:16:08,092 --> 00:16:09,719
Well, this is happening so fast.

428
00:16:09,761 --> 00:16:11,304
Well, what do I do
about Lindsay?

429
00:16:11,345 --> 00:16:14,098
I mean, can I just improv my way
out of a marriage?

430
00:16:15,141 --> 00:16:18,686
Yes, and... let's do this.

431
00:16:18,728 --> 00:16:19,771
Blackout.

432
00:16:19,813 --> 00:16:21,439
<i>Unaware that a similar</i>

433
00:16:21,481 --> 00:16:23,983
<i>off-menu swap had just occurred</i>
<i>at Swappigans,</i>

434
00:16:24,024 --> 00:16:25,568
<i>Tobias broke the news</i>

435
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:27,946
<i>that he was leaving Lindsay</i>
<i>in a phone call.</i>

436
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:29,447
...for I have met someone.

437
00:16:29,489 --> 00:16:31,073
It's not important who it is.

438
00:16:31,115 --> 00:16:32,659
(laughs):
It's Sue Storm.

439
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,828
I'm so sorry,
but DeBrie believes in me,

440
00:16:34,869 --> 00:16:36,788
and she stopped my heart, too.

441
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:39,874
<i>If you're wondering what "too"</i>
<i>referred to, it was this:</i>

442
00:16:39,916 --> 00:16:41,208
Let's do this.

443
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:42,710
Blackout.

444
00:16:42,752 --> 00:16:44,921
And scene, as they say.

445
00:16:44,963 --> 00:16:46,297
Her heart stopped!
She-She's dying!

446
00:16:46,339 --> 00:16:48,800
Please, someone!
She had too much butter!

447
00:16:48,842 --> 00:16:50,301
-She's a very famous actress!
-Someone say "butter" out here?

448
00:16:50,343 --> 00:16:52,052
Oh, my God,
that's a butter face.

449
00:16:52,094 --> 00:16:54,347
-How much butter did the
patient have? -I don't know.

450
00:16:54,388 --> 00:16:56,182
-A<i> Star Trek</i> chess set's worth.
-Damn it, that Swappigans

451
00:16:56,223 --> 00:16:58,643
puts more people in
this hospital. Make way, people!

452
00:16:58,685 --> 00:16:59,894
We got a 61-year-old male

453
00:16:59,936 --> 00:17:01,354
in full cardiac arrest
coming through.

454
00:17:01,395 --> 00:17:02,605
You have to wait outside, sir.

455
00:17:02,647 --> 00:17:03,898
Be careful of her face!

456
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:05,692
She's an actress!

457
00:17:05,733 --> 00:17:07,443
(loud sobbing)

458
00:17:07,485 --> 00:17:09,028
<i>It's worth noting that Tobias</i>

459
00:17:09,069 --> 00:17:11,364
<i>had heard this hospital</i>
<i>in Orange County</i>

460
00:17:11,405 --> 00:17:13,950
<i>was a favorite</i>
<i>of show business big shots</i>

461
00:17:13,992 --> 00:17:15,451
<i>seeking plastic surgery.</i>

462
00:17:15,493 --> 00:17:17,578
We're both actors!

463
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:19,664
(loud, exaggerated sobbing)

464
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:24,711
NARRATOR:
<i>On the day of Lucille's trial,</i>

465
00:17:24,752 --> 00:17:27,005
<i>Tobias was in a hospital</i>
<i>with a woman</i>

466
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:29,716
<i>he'd both fallen for</i>
<i>and had rushed into an ICU.</i>

467
00:17:29,757 --> 00:17:32,468
See? Makeup makes everyone
feel a little better.

468
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:33,970
You didn't leave me.

469
00:17:34,012 --> 00:17:35,889
Everybody leaves me.

470
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:39,684
I've been left in Dumpsters
and on a curb and...

471
00:17:39,726 --> 00:17:41,227
Oh, I wouldn't dream of it.

472
00:17:41,268 --> 00:17:43,646
Excuse me. Could you, uh,
leave us alone for...

473
00:17:43,688 --> 00:17:45,398
-Yeah, absolutely, yes.
-Thank you.

474
00:17:45,439 --> 00:17:47,692
Oh, no, I-I'd like him
to-to stay.

475
00:17:47,734 --> 00:17:48,776
-Really?
-Yeah.

476
00:17:48,818 --> 00:17:49,777
Okay.

477
00:17:49,819 --> 00:17:51,070
I'm afraid that you have

478
00:17:51,111 --> 00:17:52,989
tested positive
for chlamydia, syphilis,

479
00:17:53,031 --> 00:17:54,448
gonorrhea, hepatitis,
pancreatitis,

480
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:57,785
trichomonitis,
nongonococcal urethritis.

481
00:17:57,827 --> 00:18:00,747
All the itises, really,
and there's also

482
00:18:00,788 --> 00:18:01,998
a host of osises.

483
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:03,750
Now, what this means
in nonmedical terms

484
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:06,711
is that you have landed, uh,
a real party girl.

485
00:18:06,753 --> 00:18:08,629
TOBIAS:
Well, will she be okay?

486
00:18:08,671 --> 00:18:10,339
Well, we can treat
all of these things,

487
00:18:10,381 --> 00:18:12,008
but if she's really
gonna be okay,

488
00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:14,010
uh, she's gonna have to tackle
this drug problem.

489
00:18:14,052 --> 00:18:16,262
You didn't tell me
you had a drug problem.

490
00:18:16,303 --> 00:18:18,472
We met at a methadone clinic.

491
00:18:18,514 --> 00:18:19,473
Are you high?

492
00:18:19,515 --> 00:18:20,934
We met at an acting class.

493
00:18:20,975 --> 00:18:22,685
The Method One...

494
00:18:22,727 --> 00:18:25,396
There it is. I'm gonna let
you guys, uh, hash this out.

495
00:18:25,438 --> 00:18:27,481
I guess I shouldn't have
lied about being clean

496
00:18:27,523 --> 00:18:30,735
when I took that methadone,
but I'll do better this time.

497
00:18:30,777 --> 00:18:32,070
Or are you gonna leave me

498
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:34,280
now that you know
that I'm a druggie?

499
00:18:34,321 --> 00:18:37,617
DeBrie, look, some people
struggle with addiction,

500
00:18:37,658 --> 00:18:40,244
other people are incapable
of ever being nude.

501
00:18:40,286 --> 00:18:41,788
Everybody has something.

502
00:18:41,829 --> 00:18:44,832
And it's my professional opinion
that your drug use

503
00:18:44,874 --> 00:18:48,795
is a direct result of your
abandoning your dream of acting.

504
00:18:48,836 --> 00:18:50,588
You are a gifted actress.

505
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:52,590
When I first saw<i> Straight Bait,</i>

506
00:18:52,632 --> 00:18:53,925
there were two men making love,

507
00:18:53,967 --> 00:18:55,969
but I couldn't take
my eyes off of you.

508
00:18:56,010 --> 00:18:57,720
You watched<i> Straight Bait?</i>

509
00:18:57,762 --> 00:18:59,263
Oh, just<i> 2, 4</i> and<i> 9.</i>

510
00:18:59,305 --> 00:19:01,682
You were with a guy
who didn't care about you.

511
00:19:01,724 --> 00:19:04,936
But stick with me,
and I'll make you famous.

512
00:19:04,978 --> 00:19:08,689
By cashing in
on your most celebrated role.

513
00:19:08,731 --> 00:19:09,857
Come one, come all!

514
00:19:09,899 --> 00:19:12,318
Get your photo taken
with Sue Storm

515
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:13,820
from the<i> Fantastic Four!</i>

516
00:19:13,861 --> 00:19:15,446
Hey, is that Jessica Alba?

517
00:19:15,488 --> 00:19:18,365
No, this is the original
Sue Storm, DeBrie Bardeaux!

518
00:19:18,407 --> 00:19:20,284
-Who?
-The original Sue Storm,

519
00:19:20,326 --> 00:19:21,911
DeBrie Bardeaux. She-- No, no!

520
00:19:21,953 --> 00:19:22,912
No free pictures, kids!

521
00:19:22,954 --> 00:19:23,913
No, no, scram!

522
00:19:23,955 --> 00:19:24,956
Get out of here! Go!

523
00:19:24,998 --> 00:19:26,290
Go, get out of here.

524
00:19:26,332 --> 00:19:27,834
I don't think this is working.

525
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:30,210
Maybe I need to get
a regular job.

526
00:19:30,252 --> 00:19:32,379
I do have a law degree.

527
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:34,256
I know, I know,
and I'm a doctor.

528
00:19:34,298 --> 00:19:36,216
But no, let's not settle.

529
00:19:36,258 --> 00:19:38,218
Look, it's the<i> Fantastic Four.</i>

530
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:40,763
No one recognizes one alone.

531
00:19:40,805 --> 00:19:42,140
I've got an idea.

532
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:44,266
Ten dollars gets you
a picture with

533
00:19:44,308 --> 00:19:45,518
real Hollywood characters!

534
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:46,727
What do you say? Ten dollars.

535
00:19:46,769 --> 00:19:47,728
That's certainly cheap.

536
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:49,981
Oh! Hello, young man,

537
00:19:50,023 --> 00:19:52,274
and his... uncle? Neighbor?

538
00:19:52,316 --> 00:19:53,567
Father.

539
00:19:53,609 --> 00:19:54,861
Oh! That's terrific.

540
00:19:54,902 --> 00:19:56,278
(laughs)
Well, how would you like

541
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,655
to have your picture taken

542
00:19:57,697 --> 00:20:00,533
with real Hollywood
movie land characters?

543
00:20:00,574 --> 00:20:01,951
Are you the Smurfs?

544
00:20:01,993 --> 00:20:03,536
No, no, no.

545
00:20:03,577 --> 00:20:05,121
They're the Ambiguously Gay Duo.

546
00:20:05,163 --> 00:20:06,455
Oh, I assure you,

547
00:20:06,497 --> 00:20:08,290
there's nothing ambiguous
about me.

548
00:20:08,332 --> 00:20:10,584
I'm Johnny Storm,
the human flamer.

549
00:20:10,626 --> 00:20:14,421
And this is Sue Storm, my sister
and fellow fighter-in-law.

550
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:16,590
Now watch as I get--
no, I have special effects!

551
00:20:16,632 --> 00:20:18,467
Look, children love fire.

552
00:20:18,509 --> 00:20:19,510
Oh.

553
00:20:19,552 --> 00:20:20,511
This isn't working either.

554
00:20:20,553 --> 00:20:22,180
(sighs)
You're right.

555
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:24,640
Two people in blue
doesn't say<i> Fantastic Four.</i>

556
00:20:24,682 --> 00:20:26,350
You know what though?

557
00:20:26,392 --> 00:20:28,435
I think I may have
just the thing.

558
00:20:28,477 --> 00:20:29,645
Oh?

559
00:20:29,687 --> 00:20:31,731
Just "the thing."

560
00:20:31,772 --> 00:20:33,191
Cut to...

561
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:35,776
Now that I'm the iconic
rock man The Thing,

562
00:20:35,818 --> 00:20:37,403
no one will misunderstand.

563
00:20:37,444 --> 00:20:40,156
I'm sure the Blues Brothers here
will know who we are.

564
00:20:40,198 --> 00:20:42,033
Excuse me, are you Sue Storm
and The Thing?

565
00:20:42,075 --> 00:20:43,868
Oh, who's smart now?

566
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:45,578
Indeed we are.

567
00:20:45,619 --> 00:20:47,705
<i>In fact, they were orthodox</i>
<i>members of the law firm</i>

<i>&amp; Feinberg.</i>

569

We represent Stan Lee

570
00:20:53,211 --> 00:20:54,837
This is a cease and desist

571
00:20:54,879 --> 00:20:56,630
ordering you
to stop impersonating

572
00:20:56,672 --> 00:20:58,298
any of our trademark characters.

573
00:20:58,340 --> 00:20:59,800
Oh, let me take a look at that.

574
00:20:59,842 --> 00:21:00,885
I have a law degree.

575
00:21:00,927 --> 00:21:02,095
No, DeBrie, I've got this.

576
00:21:02,136 --> 00:21:04,304
Mr. Feinberg?

577
00:21:04,346 --> 00:21:05,973
Uh, would it change your mind

578
00:21:06,015 --> 00:21:10,061
if I offered you
a free Sue Storm armband?

579
00:21:10,103 --> 00:21:11,979
<i>It did not change his mind.</i>

580
00:21:12,021 --> 00:21:14,732
<i>And although the hate crime</i>
<i>charges were dismissed,</i>

581
00:21:14,774 --> 00:21:16,483

<i>to pose as the Fantastic Four.</i>

583
00:21:18,027 --> 00:21:20,738
Can they really make us leave
Hollywood Boulevard?

584
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:23,866
Well, apparently in
this instance, paper beats rock.

585
00:21:23,908 --> 00:21:24,867
You have a rock?

586
00:21:24,909 --> 00:21:27,203
No, I am your rock now.

587
00:21:27,245 --> 00:21:28,246
Oh.

588
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:29,413
So what are we gonna do

589
00:21:29,455 --> 00:21:31,124
now that we don't
have the rights?

590
00:21:31,165 --> 00:21:32,917
Well, we just go off-brand.

591
00:21:32,959 --> 00:21:36,503
Uh, we'll just change the names
and do a cheap generic knockoff.

592
00:21:36,545 --> 00:21:38,297
Kids don't care.

593
00:21:38,338 --> 00:21:40,049
<i>Tobias took them down</i>
<i>to a street</i>

594

00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:47,890
Hello, young man.
What brings you

598
00:21:47,932 --> 00:21:50,851
to at least 500 feet
past the entrance of Disneyland?

599
00:21:50,893 --> 00:21:52,019
Dad, can I get my picture taken

600
00:21:52,061 --> 00:21:53,187
with The Thing
and Invisible Girl?

601
00:21:53,229 --> 00:21:54,730
They're the Fantastic Four.

602
00:21:54,772 --> 00:21:56,732
Well, actually, technically,
I'm Rock Monster,

603
00:21:56,774 --> 00:21:59,068
and this is
Ability to Be Invisible Person.

604
00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:00,987
-Hey, you guys want
the ten dollars or not? -Yeah.

605
00:22:01,028 --> 00:22:02,529
-Uh...
-Yeah, yeah.

606
00:22:02,571 --> 00:22:04,240
Yes. Okay.

607
00:22:04,282 --> 00:22:06,826
We're The Thing
and the Invisible Girl.

608
00:22:06,867 --> 00:22:07,952
-You're under arrest.
-What?

609
00:22:07,994 --> 00:22:09,495
Boom. Turn around.

610
00:22:09,536 --> 00:22:10,871
-Let's go.
-I didn't...

611
00:22:10,913 --> 00:22:12,290
-Let's go. Get up there.
-Oh! Oh!

612
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:14,083
Come on.

613
00:22:14,125 --> 00:22:16,085
-Oh, come on, now.
-(chuckles): No, no, no.

614
00:22:16,127 --> 00:22:18,504
We're not gonna kill him,
we're just gonna handcuff him.

615
00:22:18,545 --> 00:22:20,131
You can't shoot us
'cause it's not a felony.

616
00:22:20,173 --> 00:22:22,258
Keep your eyes on her.
I'll be right back.

617
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:24,260

a third strike.

Three-strikes law's up for
review in the appellate courts,

621
00:22:31,851 --> 00:22:33,144
but we really
shouldn't be charging.

622
00:22:33,186 --> 00:22:34,895

630
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:49,493

selling his fishing costume.

632
00:22:51,578 --> 00:22:53,789
No, I was gonna

00:24:39,353 --> 00:24:42,189
I almost (bleep) a guy
for a hamburger,

685
00:24:42,231 --> 00:24:45,109
and you turned down
$120,000 a year?

686
00:24:45,151 --> 00:24:47,569
To keep our dream alive,
yes, I did.

687
00:24:47,611 --> 00:24:49,322
I thought you'd be proud of me.

688
00:24:49,363 --> 00:24:51,240
After all, a doctor in India

689
00:24:51,282 --> 00:24:53,826
told me that I have the gift
to make people laugh.

690
00:24:53,867 --> 00:24:55,493
-(sobbing)
-Why are you crying?

691
00:24:55,535 --> 00:24:57,579
(sobbing):
You're worse than Marky.

692
00:24:57,621 --> 00:25:01,583
He couldn't see me,
but you can't hear me.

693

694
00:25:03,627 --> 00:25:06,088
<i>The setback sent</i>

<i>back to her old ways.</i>

696
00:25:08,841 --> 00:25:11,385

00:25:19,685 --> 00:25:22,855
<i>Perhaps it was</i>

702

00:25:26,692 --> 00:25:28,235
Who are you supposed to be?

704
00:25:28,277 --> 00:25:30,737
Oh, I'm The Thing
from<i> Fantastic Four.</i>

705
00:25:30,779 --> 00:25:33,740
You've been served, (bleep).

706
00:25:33,782 --> 00:25:36,327
Oh, (bleep) me.

707
00:25:36,369 --> 00:25:38,162
Are you undercover as well?

708
00:25:38,204 --> 00:25:40,122
I'm CIA.
Not here for you though.

709
00:25:40,164 --> 00:25:42,500
Scoping out
Imagine Entertainment.

00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:44,918
<i>So, with nowhere to go...</i>

711
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,628
Thought I'd try you again.

<i>...and no one to help him</i>

Honey, you read

714

<i>...he went to see</i>

(singing quietly)

718
00:25:59,099 --> 00:26:01,852
Now the fun begins,
right, Officer Three?

719
00:26:01,894 --> 00:26:03,729
I'll say.

720
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:06,315
...and why and how. Who, what,
when, where, why and how.

721
00:26:07,733 --> 00:26:10,486
Is there a little girl here
all by herself?

722
00:26:10,528 --> 00:26:12,821
<i>And perhaps it was this</i>
<i>that would finally</i>

723
00:26:12,863 --> 00:26:15,408

<i>that he sometimes did speak</i>

724
00:26:15,449 --> 00:26:17,117
<i>in a misleading way.</i>

725
00:26:17,159 --> 00:26:19,953
Daddy needs to get

728
00:26:29,463 --> 00:26:31,215
Have some lemonade.

00:26:35,761 --> 00:26:37,012
It is.

Is there alcohol in here--
John Beard!

733

Please, have a seat.

Okay.

Why are you here?

736
00:26:41,934 --> 00:26:43,310
I'm here to see my little girl.

737
00:26:43,352 --> 00:26:45,563
I wanted to show her
Daddy's Thing.

What are you doing here?

00:26:46,939 --> 00:26:49,691
I'm doing a, um,
a local interest piece.

Mm.

Okay, get in there, boys.

Oh, really local.

That's right, yeah.

744

Is this about my daughter?

Oh, so it's your daughter

-Yes.

Maeby.

BEARD:
Let me ask you this.

750
00:27:03,663 --> 00:27:04,622
How old is she?

751
00:27:04,664 --> 00:27:06,666
(chuckles):
Oh.

752
00:27:06,708 --> 00:27:08,544
Why do you put me on the spot?

753
00:27:08,586 --> 00:27:11,464
Um, I want to say 19?

754
00:27:11,505 --> 00:27:14,049
But I like
to think of her as 15.

755

Well, you're free to go.

756

Tell him there's a raccoon

Hey, guess what.

765
00:27:30,983 --> 00:27:32,734
There's a raccoon
out on the patio!

Bull (bleep).
