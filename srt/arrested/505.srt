00:00:11,428 --> 00:00:14,055
[Ron Howard] <i>Michael was on his way</i>
<i>to see Rebel Alley</i>

2
00:00:14,139 --> 00:00:16,683
<i>after being less than honest with his son</i>

3
00:00:16,766 --> 00:00:18,560
<i>about having broken up with her...</i>

4
00:00:18,643 --> 00:00:20,687
I got a cactus, for God's sakes.

5
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:22,731
That's a universal sign
for "things are over."

6
00:00:22,814 --> 00:00:24,315
<i>...when he'd actually told her...</i>

7
00:00:24,399 --> 00:00:26,317
I ain't going nowhere.

8
00:00:26,401 --> 00:00:29,362
[Ron] <i>George Michael had similarly</i>
<i>made a false claim.</i>

9
00:00:29,446 --> 00:00:31,823
-Do you have plans with Rebel?
-Yeah.

10
00:00:31,906 --> 00:00:33,950
-Do you? Good for you guys.
-I do, yeah.

11
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:36,077
-It's fun. Yeah.
-[Ron] <i>When the truth was...</i>

12
00:00:36,161 --> 00:00:38,121
I haven't seen her since I punched him.

13
00:00:38,204 --> 00:00:40,623
[Ron] <i>And each was worried</i>
<i>the other would say,</i>

14
00:00:40,707 --> 00:00:42,917
<i>"You lied to me, and that's worse."</i>

15
00:00:43,251 --> 00:00:45,003
He's gonna say, "And that's worse."

16
00:00:45,086 --> 00:00:48,131
[Ron] <i>Michael decided to tell Rebel</i>
<i>he </i>was <i>going somewhere.</i>

17
00:00:48,673 --> 00:00:52,886
<i>George Michael, meanwhile, was approaching</i>
<i>the same apartment with a plan of his own.</i>

18
00:00:52,969 --> 00:00:55,388
You take my bag of lacy ticklers,
hoo-ha bras, dog toys,

19
00:00:55,472 --> 00:00:57,974
and sex knobs with you,
and you act like you're expecting

20
00:00:58,058 --> 00:01:00,602
a booty call, as the old people
think the young people say.

21
00:01:00,685 --> 00:01:04,272
Tell her, "I'm here for a quickie,
and I'm out of here." Mr. Brash.

22
00:01:04,355 --> 00:01:07,776
[Ron] <i>So when Michael saw his son</i>
<i>brashly approaching,</i>

23
00:01:08,151 --> 00:01:10,612
<i>he decided to be the adult</i>
<i>in the relationship</i>

24
00:01:10,695 --> 00:01:13,573
<i>and avoid conflict by squatting in a bush,</i>

25
00:01:13,865 --> 00:01:16,785
<i>until his son passed on his way</i>
<i>to what the young people</i>

26
00:01:16,868 --> 00:01:18,995
<i>refer to as a booty call.</i>

27
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:21,915
Yeah, standing out here
with a bag of sex toys!

28
00:01:21,998 --> 00:01:25,168
Let's go! Not getting any less horny
out here. How are you?

29
00:01:25,251 --> 00:01:27,045
I think she's gone until tomorrow.

30
00:01:27,128 --> 00:01:29,297
Is she? Good.
'Cause I was getting less,

31
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:31,925
uh... what I mentioned earlier.

32
00:01:33,009 --> 00:01:35,929
[Ron] <i>Moments earlier,</i>
<i>a still squatting Michael</i>

33
00:01:36,012 --> 00:01:37,972
<i>noticed something in the bushes.</i>

34
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:45,396
[Toddler] All right in there?

35
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:48,691
Hey. Toddler. Hey.

36
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:50,318
Uh, this looks, um...

37
00:01:51,444 --> 00:01:54,656
You know, there's a woman in there
who's obsessed with me--

38
00:01:54,739 --> 00:01:56,991
-Oh, this one, too?
-Yep. Yeah, yeah.

39
00:01:57,075 --> 00:02:00,870
Oh, actually, I have a question for you.

40
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:02,080
-Okay.
-I'll come out.

41
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:04,082
Oh. Okay.

42
00:02:05,667 --> 00:02:08,545
Do you remember when I called you
about my brother Buster?

43
00:02:08,628 --> 00:02:10,755
The missing person thing. Did he show up?

44
00:02:10,839 --> 00:02:12,715
-Did anybody claim him?
-They got him.

45
00:02:13,466 --> 00:02:15,718
-They did. I had a feeling.
-Yeah.

46
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:17,762
Well, I'm going home.

47
00:02:18,263 --> 00:02:19,389
Okay. Great.

48
00:02:20,431 --> 00:02:21,391
I live here.

49
00:02:22,684 --> 00:02:24,727
Oh. Didn't know they paid you that fair.

50
00:02:25,186 --> 00:02:26,479
Yeah, good for you.

51
00:02:29,107 --> 00:02:31,276
-That is one dirty cop.
-[door opens]

52
00:02:31,359 --> 00:02:32,443
Dad.

53
00:02:41,327 --> 00:02:43,705
[dramatic music playing]

54
00:02:49,961 --> 00:02:51,880
[Ron] <i>But diplomacy won the day.</i>

55
00:02:51,963 --> 00:02:55,383
Yeah, I'm just... I'm making sure
that she knows that we broke up.

56
00:02:55,466 --> 00:02:57,719
I could run that up for you.
Save you a trip.

57
00:02:58,428 --> 00:02:59,596
Okay. Yeah.

58
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:01,514
Make sure she doesn't think
<i>you're </i>trying to break up.

59
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:03,224
[exhales] Nah.

60
00:03:03,308 --> 00:03:05,435
You reconsidered the scuba trip?

61
00:03:05,518 --> 00:03:07,812
Oh, God, it's tempting as hell, but I...

62
00:03:07,896 --> 00:03:09,480
-You're in love.
-So in love.

63
00:03:10,356 --> 00:03:11,274
Maybe next time?

64
00:03:11,816 --> 00:03:13,026
Promise?

65
00:03:13,109 --> 00:03:14,068
I do.

66
00:03:16,404 --> 00:03:17,280
Ciao.

67
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:18,865
I'll see ya.

68
00:03:20,283 --> 00:03:22,911
[Ron] <i>But moments after leaving</i>
<i>his father's gift</i>

69

-[Rebel] George!

70
00:03:25,663 --> 00:03:27,790
Hey! [gasps] Oh!

71
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:29,876
What are you doing here?

72
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:31,628
Uh, uh, you mean without calling?

73
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:34,255
I know. I'm sorry.
I was shooting this tiny movie

74
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:37,258
in Mexico for two months,
and, uh, I meant to call you.

75
00:03:37,342 --> 00:03:40,178
And I just landed.
How did you find out I was back?

76
00:03:40,261 --> 00:03:42,680
Thought I'd get lucky.
Well, you'd get lucky.

77
00:03:42,764 --> 00:03:44,557
I'm sure that strikes you
as inconsiderate-- I got it.

78
00:03:44,641 --> 00:03:46,893
-Thank you so much.
-Oh, he's my hero.

79
00:03:46,976 --> 00:03:49,229
Well, I hope he's not expecting a tip.

80
00:03:49,312 --> 00:03:51,981
-They instruct us not to ask.
-I don't have any cash.

81

[Ron] <i>George Michael decided</i>

00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:59,072
Sorry. Thank you. Beat it.

-Nice guy. Tough job.
-What?

85
00:04:03,326 --> 00:04:04,869
Tough guy. Thinks he's a tough guy.

86

[laughs] Wait.

89

What is <i>this </i>used for?

90
00:04:16,714 --> 00:04:17,966
That is a device

91
00:04:18,049 --> 00:04:20,468
that older people use
to put their shoes on...

92

From TV?
Well, I can think of another use for it.

98
00:04:34,148 --> 00:04:36,734
But I've gotta be gone in five minutes.
I've gotta pick up my son.

99
00:04:36,818 --> 00:04:39,153
It's gonna be a quickie,

Fine, but I hope we can spend
some quality time together later.

00:07:44,422 --> 00:07:48,426
"Remember how our Winnebago
got demolished by that train?

168
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:50,928
So many memories.

169
00:07:51,804 --> 00:07:54,307
That's why all you have to do
is look at me, and you'll realize

170
00:07:54,849 --> 00:07:57,560
that you've done something great
in this life.

171
00:07:57,643 --> 00:07:58,561
[clears throat]

172
00:08:00,438 --> 00:08:02,982
You are the golden anchor of this family,

173
00:08:03,566 --> 00:08:07,361
the man who not only left his mark
on Newport

174
00:08:07,695 --> 00:08:10,823
with the great banana... stand...

175
00:08:11,574 --> 00:08:14,160
up. Good habit. Standing is-- Yep.

176
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:17,371
You always leave your mark
everywhere you sit.

177
00:08:18,664 --> 00:08:19,707
So I give you

178
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:22,877
the biggest anchor of gold in the world.

179
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:26,506
I only wish it were real gold
so that you wouldn't have 30 years

180
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:28,174
of hard work ahead of you."

181
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:31,135
Thirty years!

182
00:08:31,219 --> 00:08:33,095
[Ron] <i>What a horrible speech.</i>

183
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:34,514
[George Sr.] Oh, my gosh.

184
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,517
[chuckling] Uh, thank you.

185
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,935
I, uh...

186
00:08:39,894 --> 00:08:42,980
Oh, wow, it's heavy. I haven't...
This, uh, well...

187
00:08:43,064 --> 00:08:45,191
Let 'em try to take this away from me,
huh?

188
00:08:45,274 --> 00:08:47,860
They'll have to pry it
out of your cold, dead hands.

189
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:51,322
[Ron] <i>And soon, Lindsay arrived</i>

190
00:08:51,405 --> 00:08:53,533
<i>in what was her second outfit of the day.</i>

191
00:08:53,616 --> 00:08:55,618
{\an8}[Lucille] Oh, you're not wearing that.

192
00:08:55,701 --> 00:08:58,788
You're running to fill a House seat,
not a sofa.

193
00:08:58,871 --> 00:09:01,415
I'm starting to worry
you're not even capable

194
00:09:01,499 --> 00:09:03,626
of saying something nice
about me in your speech.

195
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:06,379
Lindsay, saying nice things
about you is easy.

196
00:09:06,462 --> 00:09:07,755
Oh, Mom.

197
00:09:07,838 --> 00:09:09,757
The hard part is not sounding sarcastic.

198
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,467
Oh, now, seriously, go change.

199
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:13,928
That outfit shouldn't even come
in that size.

200
00:09:14,011 --> 00:09:15,304
How about this, Mom?

201
00:09:17,098 --> 00:09:19,475
Nothing to criticize now. Happy?

202
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:22,311
Come on,
let me hear one of your crinkly smiles.

203
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:24,897
-[Lucille] At least it fits.
-[Lindsay scoffs, groans]

204
00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:28,234
-Look who grew out of her sheet.
-[Lindsay] I thought about it.

205
00:09:28,317 --> 00:09:30,945
It's a big day.
I'm being honored. I should look my best.

206
00:09:31,028 --> 00:09:32,655
Well, let me know when you do.

207
00:09:33,447 --> 00:09:36,075
And you just won yourself
a sheet-covered daughter.

208
00:09:37,702 --> 00:09:38,911
[Lucille] Take that off.

209
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:40,580
The cameras are getting this.

210
00:09:40,663 --> 00:09:43,499
[Lindsay] You don't like anything
under this. Why should I take it off?

211
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:45,042
You don't have a speech for me.

212
00:09:45,126 --> 00:09:46,669
[Lucille] You're going to be surprised

213
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:48,838
-when I get up there.
-[Lindsay groans]

214
00:09:50,798 --> 00:09:54,594
Know what your number one tool is
for a scuba diver?

215
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:58,139
Your sun. All right?
You gotta see how the sun

216
00:09:58,222 --> 00:10:01,100
is coming through the ocean,
'cause that's gonna be your guiding light.

217
00:10:01,183 --> 00:10:03,769
[Ron] <i>And as Michael</i>
<i>faced his biggest fear,</i>

218
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:04,937
<i>leaving behind his son...</i>

219
00:10:05,021 --> 00:10:07,273
I gotta go back. You can't leave.

220
00:10:07,356 --> 00:10:09,108
-Turn this around.
-[instructor] Too late.

221
00:10:09,191 --> 00:10:12,028
-Double dock fees. Got a tight schedule.
-<i>...his son showed up,</i>

222
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:14,780
<i>willing to face a big fear himself.</i>

223
00:10:15,781 --> 00:10:17,074
Hey! Hey!

224
00:10:17,158 --> 00:10:19,201
What are you doing?
I was coming back to you.

225
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:20,911
What? No, I just--

226
00:10:20,995 --> 00:10:23,414
I don't want to leave things
emotionally ambiguous

227
00:10:23,497 --> 00:10:25,333
-or unresolved!
-[Michael] I don't want to leave

228
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:27,460
without having some sense of the...

229
00:10:27,543 --> 00:10:30,296
-[distant] ...value of this relationship!
-What?

230
00:10:30,379 --> 00:10:33,257
[Ron] <i>The farther away they got,</i>
<i>the more they realized</i>

231
00:10:33,341 --> 00:10:35,259
<i>they did have to say to each other.</i>

232
00:10:35,926 --> 00:10:37,345
-What?
-[Michael] Stay there.

233
00:10:37,428 --> 00:10:38,846
I'm coming back. We're coming back.

234
00:10:38,929 --> 00:10:39,805
[grunts]

235
00:11:04,538 --> 00:11:06,624
[Ron] <i>And without the ability to speak,</i>

236
00:11:06,707 --> 00:11:09,752
<i>they resorted to a language</i>
<i>they'd learned long ago.</i>

237
00:11:15,633 --> 00:11:18,427
{\an8}[Ron] <i>Which was all</i>
<i>that needed to be said,</i>

238
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:20,179
<i>but the moment was short-lived.</i>

239
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:49,834
[gasping]

240
00:11:51,335 --> 00:11:54,338
[George Sr.] You do this!
You always try to save everyone.

241
00:11:54,422 --> 00:11:56,674
I'm literally saving you. Come on.

242
00:11:57,425 --> 00:11:59,427
Turn over on your back, like an otter.

243
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:02,471
-Were you trying to kill yourself?
-No.

244
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:05,349
I dropped my prize,
and I was trying to find it.

245
00:12:05,433 --> 00:12:06,851
I would've been fine.

246
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:09,103
Maybe I was trying to save you.

247
00:12:09,186 --> 00:12:11,063
Want to save me?
Stop playing games with me.

248
00:12:11,147 --> 00:12:13,357
Stop trying to teach me a lesson
by hiding Buster.

249
00:12:13,441 --> 00:12:15,484
I talked to a cop. I know someone got him.

250
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:18,654
[George Sr.] Got him?
Michael, we don't have Buster.

251
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:20,948
We would never make you worry.
We love you.

252
00:12:21,031 --> 00:12:23,409
That's why we got rid
of your $700,000 debt.

253
00:12:25,327 --> 00:12:26,829
Hang on. What are you talking about?

254
00:12:26,912 --> 00:12:28,122
I thought that was Lucille 2.

255
00:12:28,205 --> 00:12:30,249
-You forgave the debt?
-[George Sr.] Of course we did.

256
00:12:30,332 --> 00:12:33,544
I mean, well, no, technically,
we forgot the debt.

257
00:12:33,627 --> 00:12:36,130
We can forget it,
but we can never forgive it.

258
00:12:36,213 --> 00:12:37,840
-We need the write-off.
-Why'd you think

259
00:12:37,923 --> 00:12:39,467
they were trying to teach you a lesson?

260
00:12:39,925 --> 00:12:42,344
[stammers]
Because I was teaching them a lesson.

261
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:43,721
-Huh?
-[Michael] He knows.

262
00:12:43,804 --> 00:12:45,598
I declared Buster missing,

263
00:12:45,681 --> 00:12:49,351
and then they were gonna try
to teach me a lesson, right?

264
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:51,937
By having the fake Buster
over at Lucille 2's today

265
00:12:52,021 --> 00:12:54,523
when I walked in,
so that I would still think

266
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:56,275
that Buster was still missing.

267
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:59,111
How did they know
you were gonna walk in today?

268
00:13:00,404 --> 00:13:01,238
What's that?

269
00:13:01,906 --> 00:13:03,574
It was a last-minute trip.

270
00:13:03,657 --> 00:13:05,785
You just came down to get your scuba gear.

271
00:13:05,951 --> 00:13:07,703
[Ron] <i>It wasn't a half bad point.</i>

272
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:09,413
Well, I gotta find a phone.

273
00:13:10,539 --> 00:13:13,626
[Ron] <i>And back at the ceremony,</i>
<i>Lucille had taken the podium</i>

274
00:13:13,709 --> 00:13:16,545
<i>to deliver a speech her daughter thought</i>

275
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:19,089
<i>-she had failed to write.</i>
-"As grateful as I am

276
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:21,467
to be with my family today,

277
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:25,095
I want to make special mention
of my only daughter,

278
00:13:25,179 --> 00:13:27,389
who thinks I didn't write a speech.

279
00:13:27,765 --> 00:13:31,310
This young woman has had
to show enormous strength,

280
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:35,231
and not just to endure
having me as a mother.

281
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:36,857
[crowd laughs]

282
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:39,401
But she's the one we honor today,

283
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:42,571
a woman I should have honored long ago,

284
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:46,242
because I've got a daughter
who has many faces,

285
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:48,160
and all of them are beautiful.

286
00:13:48,577 --> 00:13:49,787
She stole my speech.

287
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:53,332
Maybe you can show the world
the smile I love so much.

288
00:13:53,707 --> 00:13:55,793
That doesn't make sense
without meth teeth!

289
00:13:55,876 --> 00:13:57,962
[Ron] <i>But it made sense to Lindsay.</i>

290
00:13:58,045 --> 00:14:01,257
I've been wanting to hear that.
I didn't think I would.

291
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:04,343
-Well, now you have.
-[Lindsay] God, it was my dream.

292
00:14:05,803 --> 00:14:07,346
What a waste of a dream.

293
00:14:08,472 --> 00:14:11,642
It's nothing.
[stammering] I can see that now.

294
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:15,187
I think I'm gonna go now.

295
00:14:15,938 --> 00:14:17,439
Find out who my real family is.

296
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:20,734
[Ron] <i>And though her mother</i>
<i>had stolen a speech from Maeby...</i>

297
00:14:20,818 --> 00:14:22,069
Find my real mother.

298
00:14:22,152 --> 00:14:25,114
<i>-...Lindsay stole a line from Michael.</i>
-I'm out of here.

299
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:29,034
[Ron] <i>Maeby had planned on</i>
<i>humiliating her mother,</i>

300
00:14:29,118 --> 00:14:31,787
<i>but her mother was leaving,</i>
<i>and she wanted to give her</i>

301
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:35,291
<i>one last kiss goodbye,</i>
<i>before the cameras left.</i>

302
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:39,295
<i>But George Michael</i>
<i>had learned a thing or two,</i>

303
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:42,256
<i>and he learned</i>
<i>both those things in Spain.</i>

304
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:44,508
-Hmm.
-That takes the fun out of it.

305
00:14:44,592 --> 00:14:47,678
Maybe we should kiss again
to teach them a lesson. Yeah?

306
00:14:48,345 --> 00:14:49,263
[officer] Okay,

307
00:14:50,347 --> 00:14:52,516
you're presenting awards
on a crime scene, and that is,

308
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,059
of course, against the law.

309
00:14:54,143 --> 00:14:55,519
What the hell is going on?!

310
00:14:55,603 --> 00:14:57,688
Why?
Because the banana stand is gone?

311
00:14:57,771 --> 00:15:00,608
[officer 2] No, because of
the bloody trail that led to it.

312
00:15:00,691 --> 00:15:02,109
Ah, I've said too much.

313
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:04,987
Where the hell did you run off to?

314
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:06,780
Michael tried to kill himself.

315
00:15:06,864 --> 00:15:08,157
I got there in time to save him,

316
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,159
-but he doesn't have Buster.
-What?

317
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:13,996
[Ron] <i>Which was good news for Tobias,</i>
<i>who was already in his backup costume.</i>

318
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:17,333
And my name is Buster Bluth,
and, yes, I am a monster.

319
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:19,627
Buster? Isn't he supposed to be in jail?

320
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:22,463
Well, that's not exactly
what I was going for, but sure.

321
00:15:22,546 --> 00:15:25,799
[groans] Oh! But they're buying it, see?

322
00:15:26,342 --> 00:15:28,802
Um, hey, uh,
I just found out that they're, uh,

323
00:15:28,886 --> 00:15:29,845
holding Buster in jail.

324
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:31,472
-Buster's in jail?
-Why?

325
00:15:31,555 --> 00:15:35,351
He walked into the police station,
and they're holding him for something.

326
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:37,436
Why would Buster go to the police?

327
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:39,730
The truth, Mom? I told him to.

328
00:15:39,813 --> 00:15:43,025
But I wanted to make it clear
that I'm never coming back again.

329
00:15:43,108 --> 00:15:44,193
[grunts]

330
00:15:46,195 --> 00:15:49,198
[Ron] <i>And that's when Michael decided</i>
<i>to try out a new line.</i>

331
00:15:49,823 --> 00:15:50,908
Okay, I will stay.

332
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:57,331
[Ron] <i>The Bluths were waiting</i>
<i>for news about Buster,</i>

333
00:15:57,414 --> 00:15:59,792
<i>whom they'd just discovered</i>
<i>had been in jail.</i>

334
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:01,919
Buster's been trapped here for months.

335
00:16:02,002 --> 00:16:04,046
[Ron] <i>His mother was worried.</i>

336
00:16:04,713 --> 00:16:06,131
God knows what he's told them.

337
00:16:06,215 --> 00:16:07,800
Like we don't have enough on our plate

338
00:16:07,883 --> 00:16:10,219
with Lindsay running off
before the election.

339
00:16:10,302 --> 00:16:14,223
I left word for Barry. The guy
in his office thinks bail's gonna be 50.

340
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:16,308
Well, you're paying for it, not us.

341
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:18,477
That would wipe me out, Mom.

342
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:19,812
This is your fault.

343
00:16:19,895 --> 00:16:21,981
You lied to us about
Buster being missing

344
00:16:22,064 --> 00:16:23,565
to teach us a lesson.

345
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:27,111
Because you lied to Buster
that I agreed to look after him.

346
00:16:27,194 --> 00:16:28,237
I didn't lie.

347
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,781
I saw you that night at the pier
and asked you to.

348
00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:34,368
[distorted voices]

349
00:16:35,077 --> 00:16:39,081
For the last time, I was not there.
Or, if I was there, I have no memory.

350
00:16:39,164 --> 00:16:42,418
Okay. Does it matter
who remembers what, Michael?

351
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:43,502
Just forget that.

352
00:16:43,585 --> 00:16:45,129
[guard] Bluth?

353
00:16:45,212 --> 00:16:46,463
[George Sr.] Yes.

354
00:16:46,547 --> 00:16:47,631
Only one of you.

355
00:16:47,715 --> 00:16:48,882
Okay.

356
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:54,263
-What?
-You're the one he's gonna want to see.

357
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:56,515
He didn't want to see me
last time I talked to him.

358
00:16:57,307 --> 00:16:59,852
He said he was all grown up
and found a new mother.

359
00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:01,603
[G.O.B. laughs] God.

360
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:04,148
What a baby thing to say.

361
00:17:04,732 --> 00:17:07,401
I think this is a job
for the man in charge...

362
00:17:08,318 --> 00:17:09,695
of the president, so, Dad.

363
00:17:12,781 --> 00:17:14,366
[George Sr.] Okay. I'll go in,

364
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:18,871
but I don't think it's gonna help
if I go in and take a swing at a guard.

365
00:17:18,954 --> 00:17:22,207
[stammering] Uh, maybe I stab one of them.

366
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:25,919
No, the only way you're stabbing
anything is if you have a knife.

367
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:28,881
That's what he meant.

368
00:17:29,923 --> 00:17:32,885
-That's what I meant.
-Okay. I'm gonna go in.

369
00:17:32,968 --> 00:17:35,345
It's getting rough out here. Guard?

370
00:17:35,429 --> 00:17:37,347
So, Mom wouldn't come in, huh?

371
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:39,349
How'd you know she was here?

372
00:17:39,433 --> 00:17:41,101
I can smell her on you.

373
00:17:41,185 --> 00:17:43,854
Ah. Right. I forgot, you're good at that.

374
00:17:43,937 --> 00:17:45,773
I remember that time
she changed her perfume

375
00:17:45,856 --> 00:17:47,149
and she lost you at the park.

376
00:17:47,232 --> 00:17:50,319
[laughing]
Yeah. That never happened.

377
00:17:50,402 --> 00:17:53,864
It was at Nordstrom's, and Mother
was ambushed by the Charlie girl.

378
00:17:53,947 --> 00:17:57,034
Yes. And we found you
in the break room with the Chanel man.

379
00:17:57,117 --> 00:17:59,078
He should never have lost his job
for that.

380
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:00,954
What happened?

381
00:18:01,288 --> 00:18:02,915
He was just giving me a Fanta!

382
00:18:02,998 --> 00:18:06,168
I know I should've spoken up
for him, but I was only a boy.

383
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:09,004
-Barely out of my teens. I didn't--
-Currently.

384
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:13,425
I'm wondering what happened here.
You were supposed to lay low, remember?

385
00:18:13,509 --> 00:18:15,719
Go to the station, say you're not missing.

386
00:18:15,803 --> 00:18:18,597
That's what I did.
I was supposed to be mother bait,

387
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,766
but mother never came to pick me up.

388
00:18:20,849 --> 00:18:22,017
Mm-hmm.

389
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:23,852
Did she even know I was missing?

390
00:18:24,061 --> 00:18:26,897
No. You were no longer missing
after you got arrested.

391
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:30,818
Did you tell them that you found Lucille 2
passed out on the stair car?

392
00:18:30,901 --> 00:18:31,985
I said "dead."

393
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:35,364
Maybe they said "dead,"
and I said, "I wish."

394
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:37,324
Why'd you do that?

395
00:18:37,407 --> 00:18:39,159
I thought it was funny. [laughs]

396
00:18:39,243 --> 00:18:41,745
Oh, by the way,
I also told <i>you </i>that I saw her

397
00:18:41,829 --> 00:18:43,205
on the stair car, Michael.

398
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:47,042
-I thought you were trying to be funny.
-You have a weird sense of humor.

399
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:48,043
[Ron] <i>Weeks earlier...</i>

400
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:50,420
Tell me why she's there one minute
and gone the next.

401
00:18:50,504 --> 00:18:52,297
<i>...the cops had no sense of humor.</i>

402
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:53,841
[Buster] Maybe she crawled away.

403
00:18:53,924 --> 00:18:57,052
She was always falling down
or crawling away

404
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:59,388
or rolling off-camera and stuff.

405
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:02,891
I don't know why it's a crime
to not know where someone is.

406
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:04,726
No. It's-- This part is the crime.

407
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:06,478
[Ron] <i>Having seen he was</i>
<i>caught on camera,</i>

408
00:19:06,562 --> 00:19:09,523
<i>Buster had tried to erase</i>
<i>the security tape.</i>

409
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:11,441
<i>Unfortunately, to do so,</i>

410
00:19:11,525 --> 00:19:14,486
<i>he used his nephew's software, Fakeblock,</i>

411
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:17,656
<i>which was fake,</i>
<i>so it couldn't block anything.</i>

412
00:19:17,739 --> 00:19:20,075
<i>-But it was easy to dance to.</i>
-[Buster] <i>Oh!</i>

413
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:21,410
[laughs]

414
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:24,037
That's because if you saw the first video,

415
00:19:24,121 --> 00:19:26,748
you'd think,
"Why didn't that guy just erase this?"

416
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:29,793
Some might consider that
tampering with evidence.

417
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:32,754
-Thanks. You can go.
-[Buster] Thank you.

418
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:35,591
[scoffs] You had me come
all the way down here

419
00:19:35,674 --> 00:19:37,467
so I could play a video off our Dropbox?

420
00:19:37,551 --> 00:19:41,054
Oh. "Okay, evidence guy,
we're done with you."

421
00:19:41,597 --> 00:19:42,598
Well, it's your job.

422
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:44,391
Putting it on Dropbox is my job.

423
00:19:44,975 --> 00:19:46,602
Walking a mile to my parking spot

424
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:49,188
'cause you can't admit
you don't know how to use Dropbox!

425
00:19:49,271 --> 00:19:51,023
That's not even his job.

426
00:19:51,106 --> 00:19:53,233
He's as much of a detective as someone

427
00:19:53,317 --> 00:19:55,319
-with "detective" in their title.
-I don't care about

428
00:19:55,402 --> 00:19:56,778
-the evidence guy.
-Join the club.

429
00:19:56,862 --> 00:19:58,280
Why were you trying to erase a tape?

430
00:19:58,363 --> 00:19:59,406
I panicked.

431
00:19:59,489 --> 00:20:02,910
I had had a fight with Lucille 2
because she made me miss Mom's trial,

432
00:20:02,993 --> 00:20:05,704
and I guess somebody saw us fighting,
and if anything happened to her,

433
00:20:05,787 --> 00:20:08,498
you know they love to blame it
on the crazy vet.

434
00:20:08,582 --> 00:20:11,043
[gasps] Oh. I'm trying to do air quotes,

435
00:20:11,126 --> 00:20:12,961
but they metal-strapped my hand
because people were using it

436
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:14,671
to make tattoos when I was asleep.

437
00:20:14,755 --> 00:20:18,467
-What's going on with the other?
-This is so I don't take the strap off.

438
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:20,719
Got it. Okay, I got a call into Barry.

439
00:20:20,802 --> 00:20:22,721
-[gasps]
-He's gonna get you out, and I'm sure

440
00:20:22,804 --> 00:20:25,432
nothing you've said is admissible,
unless you've--

441
00:20:25,515 --> 00:20:27,559
Waived my rights to an attorney? I did.

442
00:20:27,643 --> 00:20:30,812
-What for?
-What for? You told me to.

443
00:20:31,396 --> 00:20:34,942
Plus, I didn't want the evidence guy
to have walked all that way for nothing.

444
00:20:38,612 --> 00:20:40,322
[Ron] <i>Michael had just left the prison</i>

445
00:20:40,405 --> 00:20:42,032
<i>-when his attorney called.</i>
-[Barry] <i>I'm here.</i>

446
00:20:42,115 --> 00:20:44,409
At the prison? You're at the prison?

447
00:20:44,493 --> 00:20:47,537
Yeah. And I'm not making a lot of friends,
either.

448
00:20:47,621 --> 00:20:51,083
The guards hate me, 'cause what is
a defense attorney doing here?

449
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:52,376
And the inmates hate me,

450
00:20:52,459 --> 00:20:55,420
'cause what is a defense attorney doing
in the shower?

451
00:20:55,504 --> 00:20:57,297
What are you doing in there, Barry?

452
00:20:57,673 --> 00:20:59,591
Legally, it's the only place
they can't record you

453
00:20:59,675 --> 00:21:00,717
when you talk to inmates.

454
00:21:00,801 --> 00:21:03,804
-[Michael] <i>I don't think that's true.</i>
-Really?

455
00:21:03,887 --> 00:21:07,599
<i>-I got the worst </i>[bleeps] <i>clients.</i>
-Look, have you seen Buster?

456
00:21:07,683 --> 00:21:10,394
<i>No, my hands are tied till you post bail.</i>

457
00:21:10,477 --> 00:21:12,813
I think the clerk said it was $50,000.

458
00:21:12,896 --> 00:21:15,941
<i>Call Raphael at Atomic Bonds,</i>
<i>tell him it's for Barry.</i>

459
00:21:16,024 --> 00:21:20,028
We can talk next steps with Buster
at your place tomorrow in person.

460
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:23,699
<i>-I prefer things face-to-face.</i>
-Less chance of a misunderstanding.

461
00:21:24,199 --> 00:21:26,827
<i>Okay, I'll do it.</i>
<i>I'll get the bail. I'll cover it.</i>

462
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:30,247
I just, I hope that our position
has not been greatly weakened.

463
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:32,165
Of course we're gonna have
a great weekend.

464
00:21:32,249 --> 00:21:33,542
<i>Talk to you later.</i>

465
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:36,503
[Ron] <i>And so, the next day,</i>
<i>the family gathered</i>

466
00:21:36,586 --> 00:21:39,673
<i>under a banner they'd been repurposing</i>
<i>for a party</i>

467
00:21:39,756 --> 00:21:42,259
<i>customized to Buster's limited palate.</i>

468
00:21:46,888 --> 00:21:50,600
{\an8}Uh, yeah, I guess I'll take
a hamburger with two tops.

469
00:21:51,018 --> 00:21:54,604
Michael said Barry would be here
with Buster over an hour ago.

470
00:21:54,688 --> 00:21:57,774
Maybe Buster made him stop
to make sure nobody found the body.

471
00:21:57,858 --> 00:21:59,651
[chuckles] Lucille 2's fine.

472
00:21:59,735 --> 00:22:01,987
Believe me,
she's somewhere with a new chin,

473
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:03,947
sipping steak through a straw.

474
00:22:04,281 --> 00:22:06,742
You know,
if Buster was a murderer,

475
00:22:06,825 --> 00:22:08,243
your mother would be in danger.

476
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:12,331
Maybe I should move into the cottage
with you two.

477
00:22:12,414 --> 00:22:15,709
That way, one of us can always be awake.

478
00:22:15,792 --> 00:22:17,753
As your therapist, I encourage you

479
00:22:17,836 --> 00:22:21,131
to let go of relationships
that don't serve you.

480
00:22:21,214 --> 00:22:23,091
You're no longer my therapist.

481
00:22:23,633 --> 00:22:25,177
Okay. We're making progress.

482
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:29,056
Then, as your roommate,
I encourage you to claim your space.

483
00:22:29,139 --> 00:22:31,475
You're no longer my roommate.

484
00:22:31,558 --> 00:22:35,187
You are just progressing
by leaps and bounds. [chuckles]

485
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:37,439
A victim of my own competence.
[chuckles]

486
00:22:37,522 --> 00:22:40,025
And this goes for your-- hold this--

487
00:22:41,318 --> 00:22:42,861
"acting partner," too.

488
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:45,530
Oh, he's more than my acting partner.

489
00:22:45,614 --> 00:22:47,824
Much more. He's my, uh...

490
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:49,993
[both] Boyfriend.

491
00:22:50,077 --> 00:22:53,038
[laughs] They think, they think
that we're boyfriends, Dad.

492
00:22:53,121 --> 00:22:55,457
Well, thanks for giving away
that surprise!

493
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:58,126
-[laughs]
-I'm his bastard father.

494
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:01,004
This is my bastard son, Murphybrown.

495
00:23:01,088 --> 00:23:03,256
Murphy? And his last name is Brown?

496
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:05,008
No. Murphybrown is his first name.

497
00:23:05,092 --> 00:23:09,596
His last name is... uh...
Well, now it's Fünke.

498
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:11,765
-Oh, that's how you say it.
-[Tobias] Yes.

499
00:23:11,848 --> 00:23:14,601
He's named after a famous
private investigator who worked

500
00:23:14,684 --> 00:23:18,605
for the <i>Chicago Sun-Times</i>
and then for <i>The Washington Post.</i>

501
00:23:18,688 --> 00:23:21,274
I believe it is a character from TV

502
00:23:21,358 --> 00:23:23,193
that was played by Candice Bergen.

503
00:23:23,276 --> 00:23:24,361
[Murphybrown] Mm.

504
00:23:25,612 --> 00:23:28,365
Well, that is a coincidence. [laughs]

505
00:23:28,448 --> 00:23:31,410
Uh, now I have two things
to be embarrassed about,

506
00:23:31,493 --> 00:23:34,454
the second being keeping this a secret
for so long, and...

507
00:23:34,538 --> 00:23:37,874
I feel like I should apologize
to maybe...

508
00:23:39,626 --> 00:23:41,545
half the people in this room,

509
00:23:41,628 --> 00:23:43,672
but maybe most of all...

510
00:23:44,714 --> 00:23:47,300
Mother Bluth, because bringing my son

511
00:23:47,384 --> 00:23:50,554
back into our family
clearly drove Lindsay away.

512
00:23:50,637 --> 00:23:52,222
Wait, Mom left?

513
00:23:52,806 --> 00:23:54,433
Then why am I wearing this?

514
00:23:54,516 --> 00:23:58,520
Oh, uh, before I forget,
this is your half-sister, Maeby.

515
00:23:58,603 --> 00:24:00,313
[Murphybrown] Close one! I think

516
00:24:00,397 --> 00:24:02,482
-she's rather very hot.
-[sighs]

517
00:24:03,733 --> 00:24:04,693
She okay?

518
00:24:04,776 --> 00:24:06,027
Oh, she'll be fine.

519
00:24:06,111 --> 00:24:07,988
I was here for her entire childhood.

520
00:24:09,197 --> 00:24:11,032
Let's put a nugget in your mouth.

521
00:24:11,116 --> 00:24:13,076
[Murphybrown] You're being sweet to me.

522
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:15,787
-[knocking]
-[Lucille] He's here. He's here!

523
00:24:15,871 --> 00:24:18,665
-Should we hide? Everybody, hide.
-He's innocent, coward.

524
00:24:18,748 --> 00:24:20,041
[gasps]

525
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:23,003
Oh, God, Barry. Barry.

526
00:24:23,086 --> 00:24:26,298
You guys, you guys, you are the best!

527
00:24:26,381 --> 00:24:28,341
-This is so wonderful.
-[Michael] Barry?

528
00:24:28,425 --> 00:24:29,885
-[Barry] Yeah?
-Where's Buster?

529
00:24:30,427 --> 00:24:32,220
In jail. [gasps]

530
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:35,974
Is this your cover
just to throw me this party?

531
00:24:37,058 --> 00:24:39,352
-Thank you.
-Barry, what's-- hang on.

532
00:24:39,436 --> 00:24:42,606
What's going on? I talked to you.
I told you Buster was in jail.

533
00:24:42,689 --> 00:24:44,608
You said you were, too,
and that if I could get bail

534
00:24:44,691 --> 00:24:46,401
to your guy...

535
00:24:46,485 --> 00:24:48,862
...then we can talk next steps with Buster

536
00:24:48,945 --> 00:24:50,906
<i>at your place tomorrow in person.</i>

537
00:24:51,656 --> 00:24:52,491
Thanks.

538
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,744
[Michael] So, you're saying
I paid to bail you out?

539
00:24:55,911 --> 00:24:57,662
You weren't gonna leave me there,
were you?

540
00:24:57,746 --> 00:24:59,664
I did not know you were <i>in </i>jail.

541
00:24:59,748 --> 00:25:01,750
That's why I like to do things
face-to-face, okay?

542
00:25:01,833 --> 00:25:03,543
-Understood.
-[G.O.B. laughs] Oh-ho-ho!

543
00:25:03,627 --> 00:25:05,128
Michael, you did it!

544
00:25:05,212 --> 00:25:07,005
You didn't know that Barry was in jail?

545
00:25:07,088 --> 00:25:10,467
[laughs] God, this is so...
This is hysterical. This is priceless.

546
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:11,676
One for the ages, Dad.

547
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:14,930
No, this is never gonna get
out of my system.

548
00:25:15,013 --> 00:25:17,474
[laughing breathlessly]

549
00:25:17,557 --> 00:25:20,685
-You okay?
-What made you think Buster was in jail?

550
00:25:20,769 --> 00:25:23,855
-You thought that he was gonna kill you.
-True.

551
00:25:24,606 --> 00:25:27,526
G.O.B., Buster <i>is </i>in jail.

552
00:25:28,235 --> 00:25:30,654
Oh. Right.

553
00:25:31,488 --> 00:25:32,489
We were just there.

554
00:25:33,573 --> 00:25:36,076
Michael made an honest mistake.

555
00:25:37,786 --> 00:25:40,413
Geez, I hope Buster doesn't kill us
for laughing.

556
00:25:43,959 --> 00:25:47,212
[Ron] <i>With danger lurking,</i>
<i>the Bluth family tightens their ranks.</i>

557
00:25:47,295 --> 00:25:48,922
-This doesn't leave this house!
-All right.

558
00:25:49,005 --> 00:25:51,424
All right. It's fine.
The boy can be trusted.

559
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:54,094
Are we absolutely sure about that?

560
00:25:54,844 --> 00:25:56,972
Why don't we let the boy
speak for himself?

561
00:25:58,473 --> 00:25:59,558
Am I the boy?

562
00:25:59,641 --> 00:26:02,894
-I've never heard a man ask that question.
-Nor have I.

563
00:26:02,978 --> 00:26:04,938
[George Sr.] You know
what would be a good idea?

564
00:26:05,021 --> 00:26:07,691
Why don't you get me a Fanta
on your way out of the family.

565
00:26:07,774 --> 00:26:08,775
It's in the fridge.

566
00:26:09,693 --> 00:26:11,611
I don't know what's happening.
