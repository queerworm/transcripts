00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:13,430
[Ron Howard]
<i>Michael and the family attorney</i>

2
00:00:13,513 --> 00:00:16,808
<i>-were visiting Buster in jail.</i>
-I take it Mother's not coming.

3
00:00:16,891 --> 00:00:18,893
-Mom? No. She couldn't make it.
-Why is that?

4
00:00:18,977 --> 00:00:21,271
She said that I could make up
whatever reason I want.

5
00:00:21,354 --> 00:00:22,939
You tell me what is easiest on you.

6
00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:24,816
Hmm, no, it's too mean.

7
00:00:24,899 --> 00:00:26,276
I think you're entitled, Buster.

8
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:27,527
She hates you, Michael.

9
00:00:28,194 --> 00:00:32,782
-We'll use that one. Sure.
-Mothers cannot accept the idea

10
00:00:32,866 --> 00:00:35,952
that they've raised someone
who could do something so vile.

11
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:37,662
-What?
-In my case, twice. Well,

12
00:00:37,746 --> 00:00:39,622
two times, allegedly. Hey.

13
00:00:39,706 --> 00:00:41,791
This falls under client-attorney
privilege, right?

14
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:43,960
[moans] Mother's disgusted by me.

15
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:45,587
-No.
-She thinks I didn't just tamper

16
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:48,840
with the evidence,
she thinks I tampered with Lucille 2.

17
00:00:48,923 --> 00:00:51,259
-No, no, no.
-She must think I'm guilty of murder.

18
00:00:51,342 --> 00:00:53,511
-Don't say that.
-Or she's busy frolicking

19
00:00:53,595 --> 00:00:54,721
on the beach with Dusty,

20
00:00:54,804 --> 00:00:56,765
-her trophy son.
-I should never have put

21
00:00:56,848 --> 00:00:58,099
that image in your mind.

22
00:00:58,183 --> 00:01:00,894
The good news is,
you thought I said "frolicking."

23
00:01:01,394 --> 00:01:02,979
[Michael] I don't think it's that.

24
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:04,606
She knows more than she's letting on.

25
00:01:04,689 --> 00:01:07,442
Like where Lucille 2 actually is.
Think about it.

26
00:01:07,525 --> 00:01:08,735
She made a deal with her.

27
00:01:08,818 --> 00:01:10,612
Or maybe she just tricked her
to leave town.

28
00:01:10,695 --> 00:01:12,614
I don't know,
but there is something going on,

29
00:01:12,697 --> 00:01:14,157
and she needs to let that play out,

30
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,284
even if you need to stay in prison
a little while.

31
00:01:16,367 --> 00:01:17,702
-[clangs]
-[guard] No pounding!

32
00:01:17,786 --> 00:01:19,621
She holds the keys to my freedom,

33
00:01:19,704 --> 00:01:22,123
and she won't use it
until she gets her selfish needs met.

34
00:01:22,207 --> 00:01:24,000
Like when she used to lock me
in the bathroom

35
00:01:24,084 --> 00:01:26,044
for grown-up selfish needs night.

36
00:01:26,127 --> 00:01:28,421
-Oh, did we have a good time.
-What?

37
00:01:28,505 --> 00:01:31,174
-No, it ended in tears.
-Guys, hey, let's focus.

38
00:01:31,257 --> 00:01:34,094
I'm wondering if there is a way
we can get Mom to think

39
00:01:34,177 --> 00:01:36,930
that the DA is onto whatever
her scheme is, like,

40
00:01:37,472 --> 00:01:39,933
we tell Mom that the DA knows
where there is some evidence,

41
00:01:40,016 --> 00:01:43,269
and then, Mom or Dad slip out
and try to get rid of it.

42
00:01:43,353 --> 00:01:44,896
And then I follow them.

43
00:01:44,979 --> 00:01:47,649
What evidence should
we say they have, Michael?

44
00:01:48,024 --> 00:01:51,402
Lucille 2's head in a box?

45
00:01:51,486 --> 00:01:53,071
-Spooky.
-Well, no. Hang on.

46
00:01:53,154 --> 00:01:54,739
That's-- It's gotta be real.

47
00:01:54,823 --> 00:01:56,825
Okay, so, if it's gotta be real,

48
00:01:56,908 --> 00:01:58,785
how about the DA is close to locating

49
00:01:58,868 --> 00:02:01,121
the stair car that she was last seen on,

50
00:02:01,204 --> 00:02:03,623
because they have a picture of it
from a security cam

51
00:02:03,706 --> 00:02:05,667
-or traffic light cam?
-That's getting there.

52
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:09,963
Okay, now inside the stair car
are two heads.

53
00:02:10,713 --> 00:02:13,842
One bald, one spiky.

54
00:02:13,925 --> 00:02:15,677
-Spooky.
-No. I loved it, all the way up

55
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,470
till the end. I think stair car's plenty.

56
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:19,931
-Okay.
-[Michael] Why don't I have the family

57
00:02:20,014 --> 00:02:22,475
gather at the beach cottage
about 3:00?

58
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:25,270
You call me.
You tell me you found out they've got

59
00:02:25,353 --> 00:02:26,813
the stair car evidence, and I wait

60
00:02:26,896 --> 00:02:28,773
for either Mom or Dad
to make their next move.

61
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:30,233
Any questions?

62
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:32,485
What's the beach cottage?

63
00:02:32,944 --> 00:02:33,903
I found out, Buster.

64
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:35,530
-Oh.
-[exhales] What a relief.

65
00:02:35,613 --> 00:02:37,615
-Yeah.
-I almost said "the cottage."

66
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:39,450
I changed it to
"[bleep]ing on the beach."

67
00:02:39,534 --> 00:02:41,119
-It's "frolicking."
-"Frolicking."

68
00:02:41,703 --> 00:02:43,496
{\an8}[Ron] <i>Now,</i>
<i>the story of a wealthy family</i>

69
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:46,666
{\an8}<i>who lost everything,</i>

70
00:02:46,749 --> 00:02:48,334

{\an8}<i>It's </i>Arrested Development.

72
00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:02,974
{\an8}<i>Michael group-texted his family</i>
<i>to meet at the cottage,</i>

73
00:03:03,057 --> 00:03:04,601
{\an8}<i>but accidentally included...</i>

74
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:06,269
{\an8}-Gangee's renting this place?
<i>-...his son.</i>

75
00:03:06,352 --> 00:03:09,063
{\an8}No, this is her place.
It's been in the family forever.

76
00:03:09,147 --> 00:03:10,732
{\an8}They never told either of us, huh?

77
00:03:10,815 --> 00:03:12,609
{\an8}-Oh.
-Says "Maeby" here.

78
00:03:13,234 --> 00:03:14,152
{\an8}What?

79
00:03:14,777 --> 00:03:17,989
{\an8}How dare they keep track of
my height while not telling me?

80
00:03:18,615 --> 00:03:20,033
{\an8}Mm-hmm.

81
00:03:20,116 --> 00:03:21,868
{\an8}So, how did it go with Rebel's family?

82
00:03:21,951 --> 00:03:23,912
{\an8}You guys seem
really buddy-buddy on Instagram.

83
00:03:25,371 --> 00:03:27,248
{\an8}<i>I also saw that that hair thing backfired,</i>
<i>huh?</i>

84
00:03:27,332 --> 00:03:30,084
{\an8}Yeah, it was great.
I mean, they're just such a nice...

85
00:03:30,585 --> 00:03:32,879
{\an8}I don't want to use "family,"
'cause they like each other,

86
00:03:32,962 --> 00:03:34,547
{\an8}but they're a nice group of people.

87
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:36,341
{\an8}I think I really like her.

88
00:03:37,008 --> 00:03:38,426
{\an8}Isn't it still weird with your dad?

89
00:03:38,509 --> 00:03:40,178
{\an8}Well, maybe that was just me.

90
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:43,723
{\an8}I'm worried she might have been seeing
her ex all summer.

91
00:03:43,806 --> 00:03:45,725
{\an8}-Your dad?
-No, no. On the movie set,

92
00:03:45,808 --> 00:03:46,726
{\an8}down in Mexico.

93
00:03:47,185 --> 00:03:49,687
{\an8}Didn't your dad say
he was down in Mexico, too?

94
00:03:49,938 --> 00:03:50,855
{\an8}[inhales]

95
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:53,858
{\an8}-They shoot a lot of things there.
-Mm-hmm.

96
00:03:53,942 --> 00:03:55,902
{\an8}It was fun. I'm not gonna see her
for the next few days,

97
00:03:55,985 --> 00:03:57,946
{\an8}'cause she's going
to Mexico for reshoots.

98
00:03:58,029 --> 00:03:59,739
{\an8}Reshoots? Oof.

99
00:03:59,822 --> 00:04:02,450
{\an8}She must not be a very good
actress, huh? [chuckles]

100
00:04:02,533 --> 00:04:03,910
{\an8}Hope she gets it right this time.

101
00:04:03,993 --> 00:04:05,703
{\an8}Well, she's not perfect, but, uh,

102
00:04:05,787 --> 00:04:08,957
{\an8}it doesn't turn my stomach
to see her eat an ice cream cone.

103
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,000
{\an8}Speaking of that,
how are things with Stan?

104
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:13,461
{\an8}Did he finish that ice cream cone
after I looked away?

105
00:04:13,544 --> 00:04:16,047
{\an8}I don't know.
I threw away all the ice cream.

106
00:04:16,464 --> 00:04:17,632
{\an8}But, not to make you jealous,

107
00:04:17,715 --> 00:04:20,134
{\an8}turns out we <i>are </i>dating.

108
00:04:21,427 --> 00:04:24,055
{\an8}For some reason,
he wants to wait till after the election

109
00:04:24,138 --> 00:04:25,765
{\an8}to be what he likes to call "intimate."

110
00:04:26,057 --> 00:04:29,727
[Ron] <i>In fact, Stan was waiting</i>
<i>so there would be no scandal...</i>

111
00:04:29,811 --> 00:04:32,730
You gotta try this new eyebrow glue.
You can eat soup again.

112
00:04:32,814 --> 00:04:34,774
<i>...especially once his daughter</i>
<i>joined the race.</i>

113
00:04:34,857 --> 00:04:36,609
Have you thought about what I asked?

114
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:38,194
You have to run for office.

115
00:04:38,653 --> 00:04:40,113
You said we couldn't risk it,

116
00:04:40,196 --> 00:04:43,408
with... [quietly] with Lucille 2 missing.

117
00:04:43,491 --> 00:04:45,326
That's the best part. She's gone.

118
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:47,537
I'm dating this woman
who's a gossip hound.

119
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:50,832
Somehow, she got intel that
Lindsay Bluth has skipped town.

120
00:04:50,915 --> 00:04:53,418
-But the Bluths are running her anyway.
-Oh.

121
00:04:53,501 --> 00:04:55,795
It would be nice to oppose
Lindsay's sudden interest

122
00:04:55,878 --> 00:04:57,630
in building this awful border wall.

123
00:04:57,714 --> 00:04:59,340
Which was my idea.

124
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:01,843
[scoffs] I have to say, Dad,

125
00:05:01,926 --> 00:05:04,429
I'm surprised you're taking
such an interest in this race.

126
00:05:05,096 --> 00:05:08,474
If you tried the new eyebrow glue,
you could <i>look </i>surprised, too.

127
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:10,977
[George Michael] <i>He expects sex</i>
<i>after the election?</i>

128
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:12,603
What are you gonna do?
That's in two days.

129
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:14,689
I know. I mean,
I can't let the guy see me naked,

130
00:05:14,772 --> 00:05:16,816
'cause, not to brag, but, you know,

131
00:05:16,899 --> 00:05:19,610
there's not a lot of 75-year-old women
who got a body like this.

132
00:05:19,694 --> 00:05:21,863
-You know?
-I don't think that's bragging.

133
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:24,824
Wow.
Well, I guess you are jealous, huh?

134
00:05:25,408 --> 00:05:27,618
[Michael] I'm waiting to hear from Barry,

135
00:05:27,702 --> 00:05:29,746
so I don't have
too much new information.

136
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:33,291
Uh, Barry's probably trying to mitigate
the damage you caused

137
00:05:33,374 --> 00:05:35,501
by taunting Buster with a skinhead.

138
00:05:35,585 --> 00:05:37,545
[Michael] Okay,
you gotta blame Buster for that.

139
00:05:37,628 --> 00:05:39,881
Say what you will about Ron Howard
as a filmmaker,

140
00:05:39,964 --> 00:05:42,133
but the man is not a Nazi sympathizer.

141
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:44,135
-[Ron] <i>Thanks.</i>
-[Gob] I've heard things

142
00:05:44,218 --> 00:05:46,721
about what's really going on
in that Grinch movie he made.

143
00:05:46,804 --> 00:05:49,849
You know, that anti-Christmas thing,
with the Who-ish people?

144
00:05:49,932 --> 00:05:51,476
I don't know what you want me to say.

145
00:05:51,559 --> 00:05:53,311
I offered to talk to the DA.
You shot that down.

146
00:05:53,686 --> 00:05:55,855
Lottie-Dottie-DA?
Oh, she's a shark, Michael.

147
00:05:55,938 --> 00:05:58,524
I don't want you swimming
anywhere near her.

148
00:05:58,608 --> 00:06:00,401
Especially after you tried
to drown yourself

149
00:06:00,485 --> 00:06:02,153
in the bay the other day.

150
00:06:02,737 --> 00:06:04,405
We're sticking with that, huh?

151
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:07,033
Mom, if you're not gonna bail out Buster,

152
00:06:07,116 --> 00:06:08,993
-you can visit.
-[Lucille] And risk having

153
00:06:09,077 --> 00:06:11,245
a story come out
that I went to a prison

154
00:06:11,329 --> 00:06:13,581
to visit my son before the election?

155
00:06:13,664 --> 00:06:15,583
That would be bad for Lindsay's campaign.

156
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:18,336
So the plan is to run her,
even though she's not here?

157
00:06:18,419 --> 00:06:19,504
-[Lucille] Yes.
-Got it.

158
00:06:19,587 --> 00:06:21,464
Especially now that Sally's in the race.

159
00:06:21,547 --> 00:06:24,217
Tobias better find Lindsay
before the 4th of July parade,

160
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:25,885
which is on the 2nd.

161
00:06:25,968 --> 00:06:28,429
-The 4th of July parade is on the 2nd?
-Mm.

162
00:06:28,513 --> 00:06:30,973
Yes. They moved it
because they don't want the Hispanics

163
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:33,935
to get even by using up
all the supplies a day early

164
00:06:34,018 --> 00:06:35,395
like we do with Cinco.

165
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:38,898
Yeah, and good luck using
the 4th of July fireworks on the 3rd,

166
00:06:38,981 --> 00:06:40,817
because we will have done it
on the 2nd.

167
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:44,320
By the way, guys,
as far as the Bluth company float goes,

168
00:06:45,029 --> 00:06:47,573
I bet you guys are thinking, uh,
will he, won't he?

169
00:06:47,657 --> 00:06:49,367
-"Willy Wondy?"
-Who's Willy Wondy?

170
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:52,453
"Will he, won't he"
do magic on our float.

171
00:06:52,537 --> 00:06:54,038
-Won't he.
-Tony?

172
00:06:54,122 --> 00:06:55,998
-Did you say Tony?
-Won't he.

173
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:59,210
Wonder. What? Why are you trying
to say "Tony Wonder"?

174
00:06:59,293 --> 00:07:00,878
-No one's saying Tony--
-Stay out of it!

175
00:07:00,962 --> 00:07:03,172
Why are you saying Tony Wonder?
Is he doing a trick?

176
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:04,298
No one's saying that

177
00:07:04,382 --> 00:07:06,467
-or asking anything.
-[Gob] Good.

178
00:07:06,551 --> 00:07:07,760
Let's keep it that way.

179
00:07:10,179 --> 00:07:13,474
Anyway, you're probably saying
or wondering-- Now I'm doing it.

180
00:07:13,558 --> 00:07:16,269
[laughs]

181
00:07:16,352 --> 00:07:18,896
...why I won't be doing
a magic show on our float.

182
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:20,523
And the answer is:

183
00:07:21,482 --> 00:07:23,234
because I've been asked
to do so on another float.

184
00:07:23,317 --> 00:07:26,696
A great company, Laguna Closet
Conversions. Know those guys?

185
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:28,072
It's not what you think.

186
00:07:28,156 --> 00:07:31,784
They, like, convert closets
to, like, organize and stuff.

187
00:07:31,868 --> 00:07:33,286
Who would think anything different?

188
00:07:33,369 --> 00:07:35,037
[Ron] <i>This geo-bead would.</i>

189
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:37,540
So, what do we have to do
to get you into a closet, huh?

190
00:07:37,623 --> 00:07:41,169
Wow, you guys don't mince words,
huh?

191
00:07:41,252 --> 00:07:45,131
[Ron] <i>After realizing his friendship</i>
<i>with Tony Wonder was over...</i>

192
00:07:45,214 --> 00:07:47,049
[Tony, over phone]
<i>I don't think we can hang out.</i>

193
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:50,720
[Ron] <i>...Gob, desperate to push</i>
<i>his feelings back into the closet,</i>

194
00:07:50,803 --> 00:07:53,598
<i>decided conversion therapy</i>
<i>was the only answer.</i>

195
00:07:53,681 --> 00:07:56,350
-We're different.
-[Ron] <i>Although, it's worth noting</i>

196
00:07:56,434 --> 00:07:57,935
<i>he didn't do a lot of research.</i>

197
00:07:58,019 --> 00:07:59,937
[salesman] <i>Plus, it's great</i>
<i>for your resale value.</i>

198
00:08:00,021 --> 00:08:01,814
How's your resale value now?

199
00:08:01,898 --> 00:08:04,150
[Ron] <i>Gob didn't want to let on</i>
<i>that he didn't know</i>

200
00:08:04,233 --> 00:08:07,278
<i>what "resale value" was gay slang for.</i>

201
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:09,989
I've never had any complaints.

202
00:08:10,531 --> 00:08:12,742
Let's talk about you.
The more we know about you,

203
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:14,744
the happier you're gonna be
with your results.

204
00:08:17,246 --> 00:08:18,748
I love Tony Wonder.

205
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:22,919
I guess you want the details.
[chuckles]

206
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:25,296
-Anyway, it's...
-[Ron] <i>Gob told the closet salesmen</i>

207
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:27,048
<i>all about his night with Tony,</i>

208
00:08:27,131 --> 00:08:29,342
<i>and how devastated he was</i>
<i>by being ghosted.</i>

209
00:08:29,425 --> 00:08:31,302
...Michael walked in,
I had to waste my roofie...

210
00:08:31,385 --> 00:08:33,596
But he doesn't remember...
Him, with my...

211
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:36,933
I guess that's how we're different,
in the same way.

212
00:08:38,809 --> 00:08:39,644
We should put him

213
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:41,646
in the Catalina cedar walk-in

214
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:43,773
with the pocket doors
and the floor lighting.

215
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:47,985
[Ron] <i>And that's when Gob</i>
<i>realized his mistake.</i>

216
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:55,117
<i>But keep in mind,</i>
<i>we edited, like, an hour out of this.</i>

217
00:08:55,493 --> 00:08:58,829
What are the confidentiality laws
concerning people

218
00:08:58,913 --> 00:09:00,331
who walk into a closet store?

219
00:09:00,998 --> 00:09:03,251
[Gob] <i>They're kind of sane</i>
<i>and, you know, they just,</i>

220
00:09:03,334 --> 00:09:05,169
they listen, they're good--
and they work for us

221
00:09:05,253 --> 00:09:06,295
'cause I bought the company.

222
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:07,964
-Ah. Oh.
-[phone buzzing]

223
00:09:08,047 --> 00:09:09,924
Hang on, this might be him. It is.

224
00:09:10,007 --> 00:09:12,343
-Barry.
-[Barry] <i>Michael,</i> <i>I'm calling you,</i>

225
00:09:12,426 --> 00:09:13,886
<i>I've got new info. It can be whatever</i>

226
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:15,846
you want to say, I'm saying.

227
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:19,016
I understand, so you are saying...

228
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,685
<i>I'm not saying anything.</i>

229
00:09:20,768 --> 00:09:22,645
-I didn't think I had to.
<i>-I see.</i>

230
00:09:22,728 --> 00:09:26,274
-What does that mean, "discovered"?
-<i>Oh, they're listening, right?</i>

231
00:09:26,357 --> 00:09:28,651
If they're listening, just say "dogshit."

232
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:32,363
Mm. What you said, I would repeat,

233
00:09:32,446 --> 00:09:34,532
but the family is here,
and I want to make sure

234
00:09:34,615 --> 00:09:37,034
-that I don't get it wrong.
<i>-Get it wrong?</i>

235
00:09:37,118 --> 00:09:38,744
<i>-Say "dogshit."</i>
-Apparently, they know

236
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:41,455
where the stair car is,
and they might even know

237
00:09:41,539 --> 00:09:44,417
where Lucille 2 is,
which means they will talk to her,

238
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,586
and we'll get all this sorted out.

239
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:50,089
-Did I get that right?
-<i>Well, with two heads in it.</i>

240
00:09:50,381 --> 00:09:52,592
One spiky one and one bald one.

241
00:09:52,967 --> 00:09:54,343
<i>No, that's plenty.</i>

242
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:56,679
-Thank you. Good job, Barry.
<i>-Know what's funny?</i>

243
00:09:56,762 --> 00:09:59,390
In the 30 years that
I've represented this family,

244
00:09:59,473 --> 00:10:02,059
<i>that is the first time anyone</i>
<i>has said "good j--"</i>

245
00:10:02,143 --> 00:10:03,728
-[phone beeps]
-Well, listen.

246
00:10:04,186 --> 00:10:05,187
If that's all true,

247
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:07,732
they might be closer to figuring
this out than we thought.

248
00:10:07,815 --> 00:10:10,443
[Ron] <i>And now,</i>
<i>Michael had to just sit back</i>

249
00:10:10,526 --> 00:10:12,903
<i>and wait for something</i>
<i>out of the ordinary to happen.</i>

250
00:10:12,987 --> 00:10:13,863
I'm gonna take off.

251
00:10:13,946 --> 00:10:16,991
And I'll check back on you later
and we can, uh...

252
00:10:17,074 --> 00:10:19,994
Um, can I speak to you privately
for a moment?

253
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:21,120
Oh. Yeah?

254
00:10:21,203 --> 00:10:22,455
You need to speak privately?

255
00:10:22,538 --> 00:10:25,333
Oh, it's just so mundane.
I don't want to bore everyone.

256
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:27,710
-It's just so mundane.
-I'll get out of your hair.

257
00:10:29,545 --> 00:10:32,006
[Ron] <i>And Michael went</i>
<i>to stake out the parking lot.</i>

258
00:10:32,089 --> 00:10:34,759
-Hey, Dad. Wait. You're leaving?
-[Michael] Hey.

259
00:10:34,842 --> 00:10:36,218
You never even said hello.

260
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:38,054
-Yeah, I just...
-Or good-bye.

261
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:40,973
-Thank you for coming out.
-I was glad to come out

262
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:42,266
because I have some good news.

263
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:45,311
Um, do you still need
that 50 grand for Buster's bail?

264
00:10:45,394 --> 00:10:47,063
Because I can get that
from the business.

265
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:50,691
No. No, no, no, no. I told you
I'm not gonna be taking your money.

266
00:10:50,775 --> 00:10:52,693
And it's 75 grand
that I'm not gonna be taking

267
00:10:52,777 --> 00:10:53,944
because the bail went up.

268
00:10:54,028 --> 00:10:55,863
Buster tried to strangle a, uh...

269
00:10:55,946 --> 00:10:58,324
Well, he technically
did strangle a skinhead.

270
00:10:58,407 --> 00:11:00,201
-Very cool.
-I guess, in a way.

271
00:11:00,284 --> 00:11:03,371
Now that we're talking about money,
I want to tell you,

272
00:11:03,454 --> 00:11:05,414
I couldn't be more proud
of what you've been able

273
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:07,500
to do with the Fakeblock thing.

274
00:11:07,583 --> 00:11:10,127
But with this kind of success,
it puts a target on your back.

275
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:12,963
People are gonna think,
"Here comes the next Steve Gobs."

276
00:11:13,047 --> 00:11:14,090
-They're gonna want...
-Jobs.

277
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:16,133
Jobs, for sure,
but they're also gonna want money.

278
00:11:16,217 --> 00:11:18,594
And don't be throwing it away.
Not just to family.

279
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:20,554
Be careful with friends, too.

280
00:11:20,638 --> 00:11:23,015
New friends,
a girlfriend that might be trying

281
00:11:23,099 --> 00:11:25,309
to slow things down.
Isn't that what you--

282
00:11:25,393 --> 00:11:27,269
Isn't that how you described it?

283
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:28,604
-With Rebel?
-Huh? Yeah.

284
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:30,856
She just works a lot.
She's in Mexico right now.

285
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:32,233
But we're better than ever.

286
00:11:32,316 --> 00:11:34,735
Actually, that money that I mentioned?
That was from Rebel.

287
00:11:34,819 --> 00:11:36,862
You know, to be a friend and support me.

288
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:39,949
Oh, boy. There's some of that
Hollywood BS. There it is.

289
00:11:40,032 --> 00:11:41,784
Right there.
That's how they use people.

290
00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:43,744
That's the culture there,
and I want to make sure

291
00:11:43,828 --> 00:11:45,329
you don't give too much away.

292
00:11:45,413 --> 00:11:46,914
Don't change yourself.

293
00:11:46,997 --> 00:11:48,624
You don't change your look

294
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:50,835
to be a part of the gang.

295
00:11:52,795 --> 00:11:54,463
You talking about my hair?

296
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:55,881
Why'd you dye your hair?

297
00:11:55,965 --> 00:11:57,341
Come on.

298
00:11:57,425 --> 00:11:58,676
[Ron] <i>George Michael</i>
<i>couldn't tell his father</i>

299
00:11:58,759 --> 00:12:01,178
<i>that he'd attempted</i>
<i>to dye his hair pink</i>

300
00:12:01,262 --> 00:12:03,097
<i>-to push Rebel away.</i>
-Um...

301
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:04,515
Yeah, I guess, you know,

302
00:12:04,598 --> 00:12:06,892
so-- so Rebel would think
that I was cool.

303
00:12:08,144 --> 00:12:09,979
-I see.
-[George Sr.] Look at this.

304
00:12:10,062 --> 00:12:13,107
Three generations of Bluths
in one place.

305
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:14,859
Anybody have a camera?

306
00:12:14,942 --> 00:12:16,235
-On my phone.
-Yes, sir.

307
00:12:16,318 --> 00:12:17,278
Oh, no.

308
00:12:17,361 --> 00:12:19,029
It's a figure of speech. I gotta run.

309
00:12:19,113 --> 00:12:21,490
Where you off to, Dad?
I could run some errands.

310
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:23,576
-Need a hop on?
-No, thanks.

311
00:12:23,659 --> 00:12:25,911
Personal business. Heading northward.

312
00:12:25,995 --> 00:12:28,831
Okay. I'm actually
complete opposite direction.

313
00:12:28,914 --> 00:12:30,249
Where you heading, Dad?

314
00:12:30,332 --> 00:12:31,584
Uh, west.

315
00:12:31,667 --> 00:12:34,170
Well, I'll hang out with you
at the, uh, beach.

316
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:37,131
Oh, uh... No.
Why did I say west?

317
00:12:37,214 --> 00:12:40,217
East is where I'm going.
Northeast. Northeast, actually.

318
00:12:40,301 --> 00:12:42,052
I'm going up to Search campus.

319
00:12:42,136 --> 00:12:44,805
I love the idea of you going to the beach.
Do that.

320
00:12:44,889 --> 00:12:47,266
Make sure
it doesn't turn your hair red again.

321
00:12:47,349 --> 00:12:49,935
And, Dad... Well, he's gone.
Okay, I gotta go.

322
00:12:51,687 --> 00:12:53,022
How'd you know I had red hair?

323
00:12:54,815 --> 00:12:56,567
-Did you see it on Instagram?
-Yes.

324
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:59,236
I did. I did. I did.

325
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,197
I just didn't want to embarrass you.

326
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,656
Showed up on my e-mail
this morning.

327
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:04,325
So you use Instagram?

328
00:13:05,743 --> 00:13:08,704
Mm-mm. No, no.
Your uncle showed it to me.

329
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:10,790
You know me. I'm a 20th-century guy.

330
00:13:10,873 --> 00:13:12,625
You can keep that futuristic stuff.

331
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:13,793
Okay?

332
00:13:14,376 --> 00:13:15,711
Okay. Prismo.

333
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:17,755
-Begin.
-[car chimes]

334
00:13:17,838 --> 00:13:20,049
User, Michael Bluth. Lost my keys.

335
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:22,384
Okay, Prismo, reverse.

336
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:24,553
[automated voice]
<i>I will. And how was...</i>

337
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:27,264
-[Michael's voice] <i>Mom's fucking cottage</i>
-[automated voice] <i>...with Gob.</i>

338
00:13:27,348 --> 00:13:29,183
[Ron] <i>And so,</i>
<i>a suspicious Michael took off</i>

339
00:13:29,266 --> 00:13:30,559
<i>after his father...</i>

340
00:13:35,272 --> 00:13:37,983
-[George Michael] He was there.
-[Ron] <i>...while his own son...</i>

341
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:39,652
[George Michael] Where are you going?

342
00:13:39,735 --> 00:13:41,946
[Ron] <i>...found himself</i>
<i>feeling suspicious as well.</i>

343
00:13:43,864 --> 00:13:44,865
<i>And Barry</i>

344
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:46,492
<i>showed up at the cottage</i>
<i>to make sure</i>

345
00:13:46,575 --> 00:13:47,743
<i>the scheme had worked.</i>

346
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:50,079
You are here. Why was Michael

347
00:13:50,162 --> 00:13:52,748
-so stingy with the dogshit?
-What are you doing here?

348
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:55,584
Was Michael lying about talking
to you on the phone just now?

349
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:57,044
Oh, no. That was me.

350
00:13:57,127 --> 00:13:59,380
I just wanted to see
how Michael was enjoying

351
00:13:59,463 --> 00:14:01,465
-knowing about the cottage.
-You want to know

352
00:14:01,549 --> 00:14:04,260
if we fell for Michael's
and your little trap.

353
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:05,886
It was a trap, wasn't it?

354
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:08,639
[chuckles] You're wrong.
Why would I do that?

355
00:14:08,722 --> 00:14:10,266
Because he paid your bail
and threatened

356
00:14:10,349 --> 00:14:12,309
to make trouble if you didn't play along.

357
00:14:12,393 --> 00:14:13,435
You're right.

358
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:14,436
I knew it.

359
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,647
The DA has a picture of the stair car?

360
00:14:17,147 --> 00:14:19,024
Like Lucille 2 would be stupid enough

361
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:21,318
to disappear in a truck
with her name on it?

362
00:14:21,402 --> 00:14:23,779
-What kind of lie is that?
-I totally agree with you.

363
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:26,282
A good lie is head in a box,

364
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:28,659
but they wanted
to go with something real,

365
00:14:28,742 --> 00:14:32,288
so we went with the evidence
they actually had.

366
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:34,206
This is real?

367
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:37,251
Yeah, and he doesn't want
to use the best part, the two heads.

368
00:14:37,334 --> 00:14:39,253
One spiky, one bald.

369
00:14:39,753 --> 00:14:41,797
Lucille 2 and Oscar.

370
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:44,383
That idiot.
I told him to keep her out of sight.

371
00:14:44,466 --> 00:14:46,218
Speaking of out of sight,

372
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:48,304
do you know where your husband is
with that Winnebago?

373
00:14:48,387 --> 00:14:50,180
Because since I got
out of prison,

374
00:14:50,264 --> 00:14:52,725
George is letting me stay there,
without him knowing it.

375
00:14:52,808 --> 00:14:54,476
-I don't know where he went.
-Hmm.

376
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:57,521
Maybe he went to find Oscar,
warn him about the picture.

377
00:14:57,605 --> 00:14:59,148
You think he really did?

378
00:14:59,231 --> 00:15:01,650
I think the prosecution
gave us this picture

379
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:05,195
so that George or you
would lead them to Lucille 2.

380
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:07,156
Go find him. Track him down.

381
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:09,408
Get to him before he finds Lucille 2.

382
00:15:09,491 --> 00:15:14,038
I will not let that woman steal
everything I've taken from her.

383
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:20,711
[Ron] <i>George Sr. turned south</i>
<i>on Coast Highway,</i>

384
00:15:20,794 --> 00:15:23,505
<i>unaware he was being followed</i>
<i>by Michael,</i>

385
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:26,216
<i>unaware </i>he <i>was being followed</i>
<i>by George Michael.</i>

386
00:15:27,384 --> 00:15:28,886
[cell phone buzzing]

387
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:31,597
[cell phone continues buzzing]

388
00:15:35,726 --> 00:15:38,854
-[George Michael] <i>Maeby? Hello?</i>
-I think my phone's ringing.

389
00:15:39,313 --> 00:15:41,440
[George Michael] <i>Maeby. Hello?</i>
<i>Come on. Hello?</i>

390
00:15:41,523 --> 00:15:43,025
-Hello?
-<i>It's me.</i>

391
00:15:43,108 --> 00:15:45,152
<i>I know you're not old.</i>
<i>Can we have a system</i>

392
00:15:45,235 --> 00:15:47,279
<i>where I don't have to wait</i>
<i>the 40 seconds?</i>

393
00:15:47,363 --> 00:15:48,781
Look, I have to be careful, okay?

394
00:15:48,864 --> 00:15:50,491
These are not tech-savvy people.

395
00:15:50,574 --> 00:15:52,451
The other day,
I turned the lounge TV on,

396
00:15:52,534 --> 00:15:53,911
and now that's my job.

397
00:15:53,994 --> 00:15:56,246
They call me "Buttons" now. Buttons.

398
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:58,832
-He's going to meet Rebel.
-<i>Who? Your dad?</i>

399
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:00,000
I think you were right.

400
00:16:00,084 --> 00:16:02,169
<i>They were together in Mexico,</i>
<i>and that's why</i>

401
00:16:02,252 --> 00:16:03,587
<i>my dad has been weird with me.</i>

402
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:05,756
Wow, I was just "specu-lying."

403
00:16:06,131 --> 00:16:07,549
<i>Well, you nailed it, Buttons.</i>

404
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:10,094
And he probably made plans
to see her this time in Mexico

405
00:16:10,177 --> 00:16:12,388
when I said my relationship
was slowing down.

406
00:16:12,471 --> 00:16:14,515
You know,
it's hard to believe because...

407
00:16:14,598 --> 00:16:16,225
my niece always told me

408
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:18,227
<i>never to give away</i>
<i>my Social Security number,</i>

409
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:20,729
but if it really is
a free trip to Aruba...

410
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:22,314
Oh, you have to go, Buttons.

411
00:16:22,398 --> 00:16:23,983
Sign me up!

412
00:16:24,566 --> 00:16:25,693
[Maeby] Peg's walking by.

413
00:16:25,776 --> 00:16:27,277
[George Michael] <i>No, you have to.</i>

414
00:16:27,361 --> 00:16:30,406
He lied about being
at the Howard barbecue. He was there.

415
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:33,409
Wow, and I thought my parents
were the selfish ones.

416
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:36,161
At least my mom never tried to sleep
with somebody I was da--

417
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:38,580
Oh, wait. No. Steve Holt.

418
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:40,666
Uh, but he's family.

419
00:16:40,749 --> 00:16:42,668
We've got to stop the lying
in this family.

420
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:45,129
<i>Tell me about it.</i>
<i>You tell one little story</i>

421
00:16:45,212 --> 00:16:47,131
to get a place to live.
Next thing you know,

422
00:16:47,214 --> 00:16:48,966
you're sorting through
your roommate's pills

423
00:16:49,049 --> 00:16:50,718
to figure out which one
will kill his sex drive.

424
00:16:50,801 --> 00:16:52,761
-Like estrogen?
-<i>Wait, that's a thing?</i>

425
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:55,305
I mean, I was just day plotting.

426
00:16:55,389 --> 00:16:57,141
Stop right there.
The minute you start talking

427
00:16:57,224 --> 00:16:59,226
about neutering your romantic partner,

428
00:16:59,309 --> 00:17:01,520
<i>you're into shit</i>
<i>that even Gangee wouldn't do.</i>

429
00:17:01,603 --> 00:17:02,896
The monster or the grandmother?

430
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:04,690
<i>The monster.</i>
<i>But, yeah, I don't think</i>

431
00:17:04,773 --> 00:17:06,483
our grandmother would do that.

432
00:17:06,567 --> 00:17:08,819
<i>Yeah, maybe it is too far.</i>
<i>I guess I can just</i>

433
00:17:08,902 --> 00:17:11,655
pretend like I have an illness
where I forget everything.

434
00:17:11,739 --> 00:17:13,115
<i>Like Alzheimer's?</i>

435
00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:15,701
That's a thing, too?
I was just crime-storming.

436
00:17:15,784 --> 00:17:18,162
You know, just lying out loud.
How funny.

437
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:20,497
[Ron] <i>Gob was having trouble</i>

438
00:17:20,581 --> 00:17:22,541
<i>forgetting someone himself.</i>

439
00:17:22,624 --> 00:17:24,501
Okay? Now you're gonna be
in the closet...

440
00:17:24,585 --> 00:17:27,212
[Ron]
<i>Which was why he was distracted</i>

441
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:30,674
<i>as the closet guys helped him</i>
<i>with his parade float illusion.</i>

442
00:17:30,758 --> 00:17:34,094
Sorry. I'm still really torn up
about this love affair with Tony,

443
00:17:34,178 --> 00:17:36,430
which, if you guys mention,
you're fired.

444
00:17:36,513 --> 00:17:38,348
[salesman] We can't change
your feelings, okay?

445
00:17:38,432 --> 00:17:41,268
But we can change whether Tony
is in your life.

446
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:44,480
After you left,
we got to talking about you, and...

447
00:17:44,813 --> 00:17:45,898
You're a magician,

448
00:17:45,981 --> 00:17:48,650
he's a magician...
Go double magician.

449
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:50,527
Two guys, one trick.
Do an act together.

450
00:17:51,028 --> 00:17:54,948
God.
Why are all the cute ones so dumb?

451
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:57,576
Look, guys, this is not that hard.

452
00:17:57,659 --> 00:17:59,787
I am pretending to be
a Christian magician.

453
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:01,914
Tony's pretending
to be a gay magician.

454
00:18:02,206 --> 00:18:04,208
We're like oil and vinegar.

455
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:06,168
What trick is gonna have room for both?

456
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:09,296
Yes, everyone could be smarter,
that's true,

457
00:18:09,379 --> 00:18:11,131
but what we meant was that

458
00:18:11,215 --> 00:18:14,510
we could book you <i>and </i>Tony
to do a trick on our float.

459
00:18:15,219 --> 00:18:17,721
Yeah. A classic two-fister.

460
00:18:18,222 --> 00:18:20,933
An old-fashioned will he, won't he?

461
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:24,978
We're just gonna need the perfect trick.

462
00:18:25,813 --> 00:18:27,856
We're wasting daylight.
Let's do this.

463
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,399
[workers laugh]

464
00:18:29,483 --> 00:18:31,360
What did we decide on?
Sorry, I...

<i>-north is going.</i>
-Oh, it's fine.

<i>I gotta go.</i>

<i>You said you were going northeast.</i>

then I'm headed east.

00:19:38,886 --> 00:19:40,762
-What's that bell?
-[Michael] <i>That's, uh,</i>

494
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:42,764
we got a Danish girl ringing a bell

495
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:45,434
-in front of, uh, A's Pea Soup.
-[man] Ice cream?

496
00:19:46,101 --> 00:19:47,769
Ice cream?
What's that about ice cream?

497
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:50,230
[Michael]
<i>No, thank you. Uh, </i>nein, danke.

498
00:19:50,314 --> 00:19:51,899
Big boy, I gotta go. Okay?

499
00:19:51,982 --> 00:19:53,984
<i>-I'll talk to you later.</i>
-Love you.

500
00:19:57,404 --> 00:19:59,865

504
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:08,957
[Ron] <i>Which, to Barry,</i>
<i>could only mean one thing.</i>

505
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:10,918
I have time for an ice cream.

506
00:20:11,001 --> 00:20:13,045
-Ice cream!
-[Ron] <i>In fact,</i>

507
00:20:13,128 --> 00:20:15,255
<i>George Sr. was returning to property</i>

508

<i>for the first time in months.</i>

510
00:20:21,136 --> 00:20:24,765
<i>And, unseen, Michael snuck</i>
<i>into his blind spot.</i>

511
00:20:26,099 --> 00:20:29,186
Of course this is where
they'd hide Lucille 2.

512
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:36,360
[George Sr. sniffles]

513
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,118
-Mm.
-[Michael] Hey.

514
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:47,788
How'd Santa like his pea soup?

515
00:20:48,455 --> 00:20:50,874
Michael, uh...
What are you doing here?

516
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:54,211
[Michael] Figuring out why you lied
about where you were going.

517
00:20:54,294 --> 00:20:57,297
I didn't want you to know.
I was embarrassed.

518
00:20:57,923 --> 00:21:00,550
I would've been embarrassed
if I was making Buster rot in prison,

519
00:21:00,634 --> 00:21:02,928
while I was hiding Lucille
down in Mexico.

520
00:21:03,053 --> 00:21:04,805
Hiding Lucille?
What are you talking about?

521
00:21:04,888 --> 00:21:07,057
I set you up.
I told you that the DA

522
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:09,101
found the stair car.
You took the bait and you had

523
00:21:09,184 --> 00:21:11,186
that private conversation with Mom.
She said to you,

524
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:13,689
"Make sure Lucille 2 stays hidden."
Did she not say that?

525
00:21:13,772 --> 00:21:15,315
-Tell me she didn't.
-[Ron] <i>She didn't.</i>

526
00:21:15,399 --> 00:21:17,776
-It's so mundane.
<i>-</i>Let me get out of your hair.

527
00:21:17,859 --> 00:21:19,987
[Ron] <i>Lucille had something else</i>
<i>on her mind.</i>

528
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:22,364
I know you said
you wanted to check in on me,

529
00:21:22,447 --> 00:21:24,241
and I have plans with Dusty,

530
00:21:24,324 --> 00:21:26,702
and I didn't want you
to find us together

531
00:21:26,785 --> 00:21:28,120
and get your feelings
hurt tonight.

532
00:21:28,203 --> 00:21:30,664
So you want to hurt my feelings
now instead?

533
00:21:31,248 --> 00:21:33,500
-To get it out of the way.
-Is that it, or are you afraid

534
00:21:33,583 --> 00:21:35,460
-I'll tear him in two?
-Hey.

535
00:21:35,544 --> 00:21:38,588
If you could tear anything in two,
you'd still have a shot at me.

536
00:21:38,672 --> 00:21:42,384
Okay, you want to see
a real man, you're going to.

537
00:21:42,884 --> 00:21:45,721
I know. I just didn't want you
to see me with him.

538
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:49,766
[quietly] Don't cry.

539
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:51,101
-[sobbing]
-[Michael] Then,

540
00:21:51,184 --> 00:21:52,811
what are you doing down here?

541
00:21:53,228 --> 00:21:54,896
This is where the curse began.

542
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:59,609
This is where that guy
turned me into Oscar, and Oscar...

543
00:22:00,193 --> 00:22:01,570
-into me.
-Mm.

544
00:22:01,653 --> 00:22:03,530
[Ron] <i>Years earlier,</i>

557

-[Michael] Take it easy.
-[Tobias] No, it's me, Tobias.

560

-Why are you dressed like that?
-Humorous anecdote.

-[Ma Bark] No water.
-Oh, uh,

575
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:18,814
we're looking for Lindsay.

576
00:23:18,897 --> 00:23:20,816
Lindsay? That dumb blonde slut

577
00:23:20,899 --> 00:23:23,485
my moron son keeps calling
every five minutes

578
00:23:23,568 --> 00:23:25,529

on Cinco de Mayo?

579
00:23:25,987 --> 00:23:27,280
Yes, yes, my wife.

580
00:23:27,364 --> 00:23:29,533
-Nice girl, but you just missed her.
-[Tobias] Oh.

581
00:23:29,616 --> 00:23:32,119
Well, uh, could we wait here
until she gets back?

582
00:23:32,202 --> 00:23:35,288
Normally, I would say no,
but the ostriches

583
00:23:35,372 --> 00:23:37,457

00:23:53,473 --> 00:23:57,310
[Ron] <i>Okay, well, so...</i>
<i>Tobias, also, was given a job.</i>

591
00:23:57,394 --> 00:23:59,688
The mail's been piling up.
You can start at Father B's.

592
00:23:59,771 --> 00:24:01,440
Oh, no, no, I can't go there.

593
00:24:01,523 --> 00:24:03,733
[chuckles] They held me up
at gunpoint,

594
00:24:03,817 --> 00:24:06,403
so you'll understand
if I pass on going back.

595
00:24:06,486 --> 00:24:07,779
If you're that worried,

596
00:24:07,863 --> 00:24:09,239
you can wear the ostrich suit.

597
00:24:09,322 --> 00:24:10,449
Mark always did.

598
00:24:10,532 --> 00:24:12,284
Oh, fun.

599
00:24:12,367 --> 00:24:14,369
If you pass out,
it keeps buzzards off your eyes.

600
00:24:14,453 --> 00:24:16,413
[laughs] Double fun!

602
00:24:18,957 --> 00:24:22,085
So, I got a job delivering mail
for the day.

603
00:24:22,586 --> 00:24:24,838
Yes, I suppose I could've told you that
from up there,

604
00:24:24,921 --> 00:24:26,798
but I <i>am </i>glad to see you,

605
00:24:26,882 --> 00:24:29,176
uh, 'cause your mail certainly
has been piling up.

606
00:24:29,259 --> 00:24:33,388
And this is my last delivery,
so I get to put on my human clothes.

607
00:24:34,306 --> 00:24:35,891
Adios, muchachos.

608
00:24:35,974 --> 00:24:37,434
[George Sr.] Oh, my Viagra.

609
00:24:37,517 --> 00:24:39,269
See, and this used to work.

610
00:24:39,352 --> 00:24:41,021
Since when is Viagra pink?

611
00:24:41,104 --> 00:24:44,065
Your mom says that the Medicare
only does the generic.

612
00:24:44,149 --> 00:24:45,609
You know, this is estrogen.

613
00:24:45,692 --> 00:24:47,444
-Really?
-How long you been taking that?

614
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,404
Uh, two years.

615
00:24:49,488 --> 00:24:52,115
Two years. Isn't that about
the time that Mom was in jail

616
00:24:52,199 --> 00:24:53,158
and started, uh...

617
00:24:54,034 --> 00:24:56,495
-Forwarding my mail.
-Yeah. Why do you think she did that?

618
00:24:56,578 --> 00:24:59,206
Maybe she figured that
if she was gonna do hard time,

619
00:24:59,289 --> 00:25:00,290
I should do...

620
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:01,791
Soft time. Yeah.

621
00:25:01,875 --> 00:25:04,085
But that doesn't explain Oscar.

622
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:07,255
He has my mojo,
and all he eats is maca.

623
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:09,382
And, actually,
it's this particular maca

624
00:25:09,466 --> 00:25:11,468
that grows all over this gully.

625
00:25:11,551 --> 00:25:13,386
-[Michael] Down the hill from that.
-Yeah.

626
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:16,306
It's from when I was running
the executive training camp.

627
00:25:16,389 --> 00:25:19,935
Boy, talk about guys high
on testosterone.

628

some of what they were on.
