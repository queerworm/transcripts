NARRATOR:<i> High school seniors</i>
<i>often find themselves</i>

2
00:00:14,667 --> 00:00:17,625
<i>in their first relationship.</i>

3
00:00:17,667 --> 00:00:18,709
How was that?

4
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:19,709
Perfecto.

5
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:21,208
NARRATOR:
<i>This is Maeby Funke,</i>

6
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:24,542
<i>and during her senior year,</i>
<i>she was dating this boy.</i>

7
00:00:24,583 --> 00:00:26,542
<i>His name was Perfecto Telles,</i>

8
00:00:26,583 --> 00:00:29,417
<i>and she was rewarding him</i>
<i>for doing her English homework,</i>

9
00:00:29,458 --> 00:00:32,709
<i>even though English was</i>
<i>his second language.</i>

10
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:35,417
And if you do my Spanish,
I'll teach you how to French.

11
00:00:35,458 --> 00:00:39,000
<i>Everyone could see that</i>
<i>they had chemistry together,</i>

12
00:00:39,041 --> 00:00:41,917
<i>but it wasn't until</i>
<i>Donny Richter's algebra class</i>

13
00:00:41,959 --> 00:00:43,041
<i>that the real bonding began.</i>

14
00:00:43,083 --> 00:00:44,208
Okay, I don't want
to embarrass anyone,

15
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:45,875
so, everyone, close your eyes,
close 'em.

16
00:00:45,917 --> 00:00:49,583
Now, if you passed the test,
go ahead and get up

17
00:00:49,625 --> 00:00:51,291
and exit the classroom.

00:00:51,333 --> 00:00:53,291

Does that include the crew?

Babies" crew...

-Oh, 43,

21
00:00:56,875 --> 00:00:58,417
but that's because
I'm good with numb...

22
00:00:58,458 --> 00:01:00,333
Oh, no, actually it's 34.

23
00:01:00,375 --> 00:01:01,667
Well, if it's dumb
to stay behind

24
00:01:01,709 --> 00:01:03,875

25
00:01:03,917 --> 00:01:05,709
DONNY:
We don't say "dummy,"

26
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:08,375
and unfortunately
you two alge-tards

27
00:01:08,417 --> 00:01:10,750

Hey, when we get there, don't
forget you're Perfecto's woman.

35
00:01:24,834 --> 00:01:27,291
I don't want to hear
about some smooth college guy

36
00:01:27,333 --> 00:01:28,500
who stole you away from me.

37
00:01:28,542 --> 00:01:29,792
Are you kidding me?

38
00:01:29,834 --> 00:01:31,291
What kind of loser spends
his free time

39
00:01:31,333 --> 00:01:32,667
tutoring high school kids?

40
00:01:32,709 --> 00:01:36,000
-NARRATOR: This kind.
-Hey, you must be...

41
00:01:36,041 --> 00:01:37,000
What?

42
00:01:37,041 --> 00:01:38,000
George Michael?

43
00:01:38,041 --> 00:01:39,000
Huh, what is this?

44
00:01:39,041 --> 00:01:40,625
Maeby, what are you doing here?

45
00:01:40,667 --> 00:01:41,792
(both chuckle)

46
00:01:41,834 --> 00:01:44,500
As I live and breathe, I...

47
00:01:44,542 --> 00:01:46,709
I thought you were the girl. I'm
supposed to tutor a kid from...

48
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:50,291
High school, yeah, that's me.

49
00:01:50,333 --> 00:01:52,291
Crazy, that is just crazy.

50
00:01:52,333 --> 00:01:53,458
(chuckles)

51
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:55,792
But, wait, why are you
in high school?

52
00:01:55,834 --> 00:01:58,500
Didn't we graduate together
five years ago?

53
00:01:58,542 --> 00:01:59,875
<i>It was a decent question.</i>

54
00:01:59,917 --> 00:02:02,625
<i>After all,</i>
<i>it had been several years</i>

55
00:02:02,667 --> 00:02:04,500
<i>since the two high school</i>
<i>seniors got somewhat intimate.</i>

56
00:02:04,542 --> 00:02:07,959
You might not even be
related to us.

57
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,834
<i>But later,</i>
<i>while fleeing the boat party,</i>

58
00:02:10,875 --> 00:02:13,917
<i>George Michael got some advice</i>
<i>on the matter from his father.</i>

59
00:02:13,959 --> 00:02:15,542
She might not be
a blood relative,

60
00:02:15,583 --> 00:02:18,709
but she is still family.

61
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:22,667
<i>So, after returning, worn from</i>
<i>the harsh winds of the sea,</i>

62
00:02:22,709 --> 00:02:24,333
<i>George Michael found the girl</i>

63
00:02:24,375 --> 00:02:25,917
<i>he now had to back away from</i>
<i>on her back.</i>

64
00:02:25,959 --> 00:02:28,667
-Maeby, are you okay?
What are you doing?
-Shh-shh.

65
00:02:28,709 --> 00:02:30,875
I'm trying to get my parents
to notice me.

66
00:02:30,917 --> 00:02:33,417
-I've been here for, like, an
hour and a half. 
-It's not me.

67
00:02:33,458 --> 00:02:35,333
<i>-It had been seven minutes.</i>
-Do you think it would help

68
00:02:35,375 --> 00:02:37,834
if I went over and said, like,
"Hey, Maeby's dead"?

69
00:02:37,875 --> 00:02:39,875
No, that would just mean
that they notice you.

70
00:02:39,917 --> 00:02:41,917
Well, obviously they've just
got a lot on their plate right
now.

71
00:02:41,959 --> 00:02:43,792
I mean, they're clearly busy.

72
00:02:43,834 --> 00:02:46,000
| No, it's just
a phallus... eee! |

73
00:02:46,041 --> 00:02:48,542
-Where's that from?
-It's from nothing.

74
00:02:48,583 --> 00:02:50,709
-Why don't you cough
or something? 
-Oh, right,

75
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:52,458
like I'm dying.

76
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:53,709
(both coughing)

77
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:55,542
There's nothing
keeping us together.

78
00:02:55,583 --> 00:02:57,709
TOBIAS: I believe
we're thinking the same thing.

79
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:59,834
-Oh, God.
-(sighs)

80
00:02:59,875 --> 00:03:01,375
But, you know, I'm actually--

81
00:03:01,417 --> 00:03:03,500
I'm glad to have
a moment alone with you,

82
00:03:03,542 --> 00:03:05,709
because it gives us a chance
to talk about us.

83
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:07,500
You know, I really care
about you.

84
00:03:07,542 --> 00:03:09,625
Oh, boy, here we go.

85
00:03:09,667 --> 00:03:11,000
You want to get more serious.

86
00:03:11,041 --> 00:03:13,500
<i>And Maeby didn't, because--</i>

87
00:03:13,542 --> 00:03:15,542
<i>and I never</i>
<i>told you this, but--</i>

88
00:03:15,583 --> 00:03:18,542
<i>George Michael wasn't</i>
<i>a very good kisser.</i>

89
00:03:18,583 --> 00:03:20,375
<i>It seems</i>
<i>he both used his tongue</i>

90
00:03:20,417 --> 00:03:22,458
<i>to fend off</i>
<i>the intruding tongue,</i>

91
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:25,417
<i>but also laterally moved</i>
<i>his lower jaw</i>

92
00:03:25,458 --> 00:03:27,583
<i>while constricting</i>
<i>his lower lip.</i>

93
00:03:27,625 --> 00:03:29,917
<i>The upper lip, meanwhile,</i>
<i>tended to retract,</i>

94
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:33,834
<i>revealing an exposed area from</i>
<i>the front teeth to the canines,</i>

95
00:03:33,875 --> 00:03:37,667
<i>ultimately creating</i>
<i>more pain than pleasure.</i>

96
00:03:37,709 --> 00:03:39,417
<i>Really just rookie mistakes,</i>

97
00:03:39,458 --> 00:03:42,041
<i>but all of it conspired</i>
<i>to make Maeby concerned</i>

98
00:03:42,083 --> 00:03:44,625
<i>about him wanting</i>
<i>to get more serious.</i>

99
00:03:44,667 --> 00:03:47,000
-No, less serious.
-What?

100
00:03:47,041 --> 00:03:49,041
Well, my dad doesn't think
that it's such a good idea

101
00:03:49,083 --> 00:03:51,417
for you and me to be together.

102
00:03:51,458 --> 00:03:53,542
And that doesn't make me
hotter to you?

103
00:03:53,583 --> 00:03:55,792
No, I could see
that argument, I-I...

104
00:03:55,834 --> 00:03:57,458
No, I think we should
just be cousins.

105
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,750
So first my parents don't notice
that I drowned,

106
00:03:59,792 --> 00:04:01,417
and now my cousin doesn't care

107
00:04:01,458 --> 00:04:04,041
that I'm at the height
of my sexuality.

108
00:04:04,083 --> 00:04:06,959
No, sure I care, and, you know,
I'm right there with you.

109
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,583
We're a couple of, uh,
forces of nature, but...

110
00:04:09,625 --> 00:04:11,834
-What?
-Forces of nature.

111
00:04:11,875 --> 00:04:14,792
But I just really need to focus
on graduating right now,

112
00:04:14,834 --> 00:04:17,583
and maybe you should, too,
you know.

113
00:04:17,625 --> 00:04:19,792
Maybe that's the best way to get
your parents' attention.

114
00:04:19,834 --> 00:04:22,458
That's a great idea.

115
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:24,792
I've got two whole months
to flunk.

116
00:04:24,834 --> 00:04:26,667
That's got to disappoint them.

117
00:04:26,709 --> 00:04:28,458
NARRATOR:
<i>Now the story of a family</i>

118
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,834
<i>whose future</i>
<i>was abruptly canceled,</i>

119
00:04:30,875 --> 00:04:33,458
<i>and the one daughter</i>
<i>who had no choice</i>

120
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:35,542

121
00:04:39,792 --> 00:04:42,667
<i>It's Maeby's</i>

122
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:46,542
<i>Maeby was trying</i>
<i>to get her parents</i>

123
00:04:46,583 --> 00:04:48,625
<i>to notice she was flunking...</i>

124
00:04:48,667 --> 00:04:50,959
So, for some reason they didn't
send me a cap and gown,

125
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,959
and I was gonna make one
out of sheets,

126
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,875
but I couldn't find...

127
00:04:54,917 --> 00:04:57,500
<i>...only to discover</i>
<i>that Maeby's graduation wasn't</i>

128

<i>top-of-mind for her parents.</i>

129
00:04:58,709 --> 00:05:00,583
They left town.

130
00:05:00,625 --> 00:05:05,000
<i>So she put her plan to put her</i>
<i>graduation on hold on hold...</i>

131
00:05:05,041 --> 00:05:07,667
-No, we do not need any extras.
<i>-...and headed off to India,</i>

132
00:05:07,709 --> 00:05:09,667
<i>where she'd be working</i>
<i>at what was once</i>

133
00:05:09,709 --> 00:05:11,083
<i>just her after-school job.</i>

134
00:05:11,125 --> 00:05:14,125
Right. Okay, do we have
to pay them in money or in rice?

135
00:05:14,166 --> 00:05:17,542
If they're in the union,
you have to pay with rice.

136
00:05:17,583 --> 00:05:19,500
<i>The movie she was supervising</i>
<i>was the latest</i>

137

<i>"Gangie" franchise,</i>
<i>this one taking place in India.</i>

139
00:05:25,709 --> 00:05:27,166
All right, I say we get
10,000 extras,

140
00:05:27,208 --> 00:05:29,125
-and then that way we have it.
-We have it.

141
00:05:29,166 --> 00:05:30,959
-Yeah, we have it.
-It's good to have it.

wearing this back home.

143
00:05:32,959 --> 00:05:34,041
You'd think
someone would tell her

144
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:35,709
to shave her arms,
the poor thing.

145
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:36,875
<i>And soon,</i>

-Wait, how is it pronounced?
-"Gan-jeez."

148

MAEBY:
Gangie on the Ganges?

149
00:05:40,834 --> 00:05:42,709
That doesn't even make sense.

152
00:05:47,709 --> 00:05:48,917
LINDSAY:
You don't get it.

153
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:50,875
I'm not used
to third world hotels.

154
00:05:50,917 --> 00:05:54,083
No, you don't get it--
you are so full of (bleep).

155
00:05:54,125 --> 00:05:57,083
Oh, you have got to be
kidding me.

156
00:05:57,125 --> 00:05:59,542
Do we have a hair
and makeup crew with us?

157
00:05:59,583 --> 00:06:00,792
Pretty makeup or scary makeup?

158
00:06:00,834 --> 00:06:02,542
Scary.

159
00:06:02,583 --> 00:06:04,083
Well, I think we have
the crew that did

160
00:06:04,125 --> 00:06:05,792
The Real Housewives
of Beverly Hills.

161
00:06:05,834 --> 00:06:07,709
Perfect.

162
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:10,208
<i>And that's how Lindsay</i>

00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:12,000
<i>-this spiritual advice.</i>
-I'm so full of passion.

00:06:12,041 --> 00:06:13,625
You are so full of (bleep).

165
00:06:13,667 --> 00:06:14,875
Yeah, yeah.

166
00:06:14,917 --> 00:06:17,041
Pull your head out of the sand.

167
00:06:17,083 --> 00:06:19,667
Love is where you left it.

168
00:06:19,709 --> 00:06:21,625
The only person back home
is Tobias.

169
00:06:21,667 --> 00:06:24,083
You have no children?

170
00:06:24,125 --> 00:06:25,959
No. Why do you ask?

171
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,083
Well, yes, a daughter.

172
00:06:28,125 --> 00:06:30,750
She's away at boarding school
in England.

173
00:06:30,792 --> 00:06:33,667
-Is that where we left it?
<i>-Although you'd think this</i>

174
00:06:33,709 --> 00:06:34,792
<i>-would have given her away.</i>
-Hug?

175
00:06:34,834 --> 00:06:37,959
Please don't squeeze the shaman.

176
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,208
<i>And while it did bring</i>
<i>the family back together...</i>

177
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:41,834
Stop with the prayer hands.

178
00:06:41,875 --> 00:06:43,583
It just looks like
you're out of ideas.

179
00:06:43,625 --> 00:06:45,750
<i>...it did make it harder</i>
<i>for Maeby to make</i>

180
00:06:45,792 --> 00:06:47,583
<i>this insult stick.</i>

181
00:06:47,625 --> 00:06:49,083
Don't you think it makes
you seem a little, um,

182
00:06:49,125 --> 00:06:52,792
what is that saying,
full of (bleep)?

183
00:06:52,834 --> 00:06:55,125
Thank you, Maeby, that's
actually a compliment in India.

184
00:06:55,166 --> 00:06:57,166
-My own fault. -I'm here
because a shaman told me

185
00:06:57,208 --> 00:06:59,792
that love is where I left it.

186
00:06:59,834 --> 00:07:02,792
<i>But soon, the Funkes took</i>
<i>their new spirit of love</i>

187
00:07:02,834 --> 00:07:05,625
<i>and togetherness into a place</i>
<i>where they would seldom run</i>

188
00:07:05,667 --> 00:07:07,667
<i>into each other,</i>
<i>and Maeby enrolled...</i>

189
00:07:07,709 --> 00:07:09,709
-Okay, going back to school.
<i>-...in a new high school</i>

190
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:11,834
<i>-for her senior year...</i>
-Senior year!

191
00:07:11,875 --> 00:07:13,125
No? No one cares?

192
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:16,667
This is usually
a tough time for teens.

193
00:07:16,709 --> 00:07:18,959
This is when drugs
often become an issue.

194
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,917
<i>...to see if her parents</i>
<i>would notice</i>

195
00:07:20,959 --> 00:07:22,750
<i>she should have</i>
<i>already graduated.</i>

196
00:07:22,792 --> 00:07:24,125
Time for babies having babies!

197
00:07:24,166 --> 00:07:26,208
Is "Babies Having Babies" on?

198
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:29,208
That's my favorite show. Ow.

199
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,875
Mother's Day Eve was the most
joyous day of the year.

200
00:07:33,917 --> 00:07:36,709
Maeby, you're going
to be late for school.

201
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:40,000
<i>And although they did share</i>
<i>one Thanksgiving together...</i>

202
00:07:40,041 --> 00:07:41,333
It's not on.

203
00:07:41,375 --> 00:07:43,041
<i>...they didn't realize</i>
<i>they were doing so...</i>

204
00:07:43,083 --> 00:07:44,917
Why would they preempt
"Babies Having Babies"

205
00:07:44,959 --> 00:07:46,291
for a turkey cartoon?

206
00:07:46,333 --> 00:07:49,250
<i>...having celebrated it</i>
<i>one week earlier</i>

207
00:07:49,291 --> 00:07:51,291
<i>when they found that duck</i>
<i>in the cupboard,</i>

208
00:07:51,333 --> 00:07:53,834
<i>tried to cook it alive,</i>
<i>got scared, and then</i>

209
00:07:53,875 --> 00:07:55,917
<i>ended up eating it</i>
<i>at a Chinese restaurant.</i>

210
00:07:55,959 --> 00:07:57,750
WOMAN: Okay, yeah,
we cook duck for you.

211
00:07:57,792 --> 00:08:00,667
<i>Nonetheless, Maeby was</i>
<i>doing well in school</i>

212
00:08:00,709 --> 00:08:02,291
<i>and might have graduated</i>
<i>had this not happened.</i>

213
00:08:02,333 --> 00:08:05,125
LINDSAY (over machine):
Look, I'm sorry, Tobias,

214
00:08:05,166 --> 00:08:06,834
but we're trying
to save something

215
00:08:06,875 --> 00:08:08,959
that just couldn't be saved.

216
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,083
Can you delete this so I can
leave a message for Maeby?

217
00:08:11,125 --> 00:08:13,041
TOBIAS (over machine):
Lindsay, I have met someone.

218
00:08:13,083 --> 00:08:15,208
It's not important who it is.

219
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:17,834
Erase this message,
and I'll leave her a mess...

220
00:08:17,875 --> 00:08:22,333
LINDSAY: Maeby, honey, Daddy has
insisted on raising you alone.

221
00:08:22,375 --> 00:08:24,875
<i>But at least</i>
<i>her father was choked up.</i>

222
00:08:24,917 --> 00:08:26,291
TOBIAS (voice breaking):
Maeby, your daddy's

223
00:08:26,333 --> 00:08:28,208
not going to be around anymore.

224
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:29,542
(sighs)

225
00:08:29,583 --> 00:08:31,709
(normal voice): Excuse me,
I swallowed a bug there.

226
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:33,041
Uh, your daddy's not going
to be around anymore.

227
00:08:33,083 --> 00:08:34,875
WOMAN (over machine):
This is the Widow Carr,

228
00:08:34,917 --> 00:08:36,875
and for some reason,
it's my job to tell you that,

229
00:08:36,917 --> 00:08:39,709
since you never made payment,
your house is being foreclosed.

230
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:41,041
Also, Tobias, you got a callback

231
00:08:41,083 --> 00:08:43,000
for something called
"The Big Bang Theory."

232
00:08:43,041 --> 00:08:44,583
<i>Having lost her parents</i>

233
00:08:44,625 --> 00:08:47,875
<i>and her house, Maeby stopped</i>
<i>bothering with high school,</i>

234
00:08:47,917 --> 00:08:50,709
<i>skipped her grandmother's</i>
<i>trial, and headed to L.A.</i>

235
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:53,792
<i>She now had to make sure</i>
<i>that she had an income.</i>

236
00:08:53,834 --> 00:08:55,333
-Guess what. I'll just tell you.
-What?

237
00:08:55,375 --> 00:08:57,208
-Yeah. -'Cause I feel
like we'll be here forever,

238
00:08:57,250 --> 00:08:59,333
and I have a meeting.
Um, you're fired.

239
00:08:59,375 --> 00:09:01,917
-Why? -Well, because you don't
have a high school diploma,

240
00:09:01,959 --> 00:09:03,750
and we have
a very strict policy here

241
00:09:03,792 --> 00:09:05,917
that everyone has to have a
high school diploma, on account

242
00:09:05,959 --> 00:09:08,041
of the fact
that Ron never graduated.

243
00:09:08,083 --> 00:09:09,250
-Is this really happening?
-Actually, I was thinking

244
00:09:09,291 --> 00:09:11,000
I wasn't even gonna
have to fire you

245
00:09:11,041 --> 00:09:13,000
'cause it's been
on Deadline all day.

246
00:09:13,041 --> 00:09:14,250
MAEBY:
How did they find out?

247
00:09:14,291 --> 00:09:15,250
KITTY:
Does it even matter anymore?

248
00:09:15,291 --> 00:09:16,250
MAEBY:
Yeah, it does.

249
00:09:16,291 --> 00:09:17,875
I told them.

250
00:09:17,917 --> 00:09:19,250
NARRATOR:
<i>With no parents, no job,</i>

251
00:09:19,291 --> 00:09:21,917
<i>and no place to live,</i>
<i>Maeby had squat,</i>

252
00:09:21,959 --> 00:09:23,250
<i>which is exactly what</i>
<i>she decided to do...</i>

253
00:09:23,291 --> 00:09:25,000
What?

254
00:09:25,041 --> 00:09:26,250
<i>...at her</i>
<i>grandparents' penthouse.</i>

255
00:09:26,291 --> 00:09:28,000
<i>And that's when Maeby did</i>

256
00:09:28,041 --> 00:09:29,250
<i>what we</i>
<i>in the entertainment industry</i>

257
00:09:29,291 --> 00:09:32,250
<i>-call "deadlining."</i>
-Come on.

258
00:09:32,291 --> 00:09:34,250
-(ostrich clucking)
-LINDSAY: What do you think?

259
00:09:34,291 --> 00:09:36,250
<i>On the plus side,</i>
<i>each parent thought</i>

260
00:09:36,291 --> 00:09:38,125
<i>-she was with the other.</i>
-And we're not moving in;

261
00:09:38,166 --> 00:09:39,417
we're occupying a space
with central air.

262
00:09:39,458 --> 00:09:41,083
<i>So Maeby was as free</i>
<i>as that bird.</i>

263
00:09:41,125 --> 00:09:42,125
(bleep)!

264
00:09:42,166 --> 00:09:44,792
MARKY:
Cindy, you okay?

265
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:46,291
All right, this will be
where she goes.

266
00:09:46,333 --> 00:09:49,083
<i>So she retreated to</i>
<i>the long abandoned model home,</i>

267
00:09:49,125 --> 00:09:52,792
<i>where she discovered</i>
<i>it's a lot harder to get out</i>

268
00:09:52,834 --> 00:09:55,959
<i>of a Bluth home than into one.</i>

269
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,291
Pieces of (bleep).

270
00:09:58,333 --> 00:10:00,083
<i>And maybe it was because</i>

271
00:10:00,125 --> 00:10:02,291
<i>she had never fully</i>
<i>disappointed her parents,</i>

272
00:10:02,333 --> 00:10:06,125
<i>and they were getting older,</i>
<i>or perhaps it was because</i>

273
00:10:06,166 --> 00:10:07,333
<i>there was no Internet</i>
<i>at the model home...</i>

274
00:10:07,375 --> 00:10:10,792
That is it-- this is like
living in 1999.

275
00:10:10,834 --> 00:10:12,792
<i>...but that's when Maeby became</i>
<i>a high school senior</i>

276
00:10:12,834 --> 00:10:16,291
<i>for the third time,</i>
<i>and then a fourth,</i>

277
00:10:16,333 --> 00:10:19,333
<i>and then it just</i>
<i>sort of became what she did.</i>

278
00:10:19,375 --> 00:10:23,166
<i>And it ultimately led to this.</i>

279
00:10:23,208 --> 00:10:25,166
So I'm still going to stay
in high school

280
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:26,458
until they notice me.

281
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,000
You know, just, like,
let them think,

282
00:10:28,041 --> 00:10:29,250
"Oh, no, should we be worried?

283
00:10:29,291 --> 00:10:31,000
-Is she really that immature?"
-Yeah.

284
00:10:31,041 --> 00:10:32,834
Well, I mean, isn't it, uh,

285
00:10:32,875 --> 00:10:34,291
kind of a little immature

286
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:37,417
to try and make
your parents worry like that?

287
00:10:37,458 --> 00:10:39,417
Oh, that's good-- I'm gonna try
and work that in there.

288
00:10:39,458 --> 00:10:41,083
Yeah-- no, I think
it's in there.

289
00:10:41,125 --> 00:10:42,834
Yeah, well,
let's get you in here before

290
00:10:42,875 --> 00:10:44,250
our-our third roommate shows up.
That's Paul Haun.

291
00:10:44,291 --> 00:10:46,333
Hi. So there's three people
who live in here?

292
00:10:46,375 --> 00:10:48,333
Yeah, well, one guy
is just kind of crashing here.

293
00:10:48,375 --> 00:10:51,333
-Well, it can't be worse than
living with your dad. 
-It's not.

294
00:10:51,375 --> 00:10:53,834
No, it's not worse than that.

295
00:10:53,875 --> 00:10:54,959
<i>And later,</i>

296
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,041
<i>-she was joined by her uncle.</i>
-Hello.

297
00:10:56,083 --> 00:10:58,250
Didn't say it was your cousin.

298
00:10:58,291 --> 00:11:01,333
Now, that's smart, let him think
there's a girl in here.

299
00:11:01,375 --> 00:11:02,917
Yeah, we were just complaining
about roommates.

300
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:04,458
(groans, sputters)
P-Hound.

301
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:06,375
-(George Michael chuckles)
-I thought it was the other one.

302
00:11:06,417 --> 00:11:08,875
No, it-it was P-Hound, yeah.

303
00:11:08,917 --> 00:11:11,875
He's the worst. See, I think if
George Michael and I didn't have

304
00:11:11,917 --> 00:11:13,959
each other as roommates,
we'd be going crazy.

305
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,041
And for a moment, Maeby felt
superior to her cousin--

306
00:11:18,083 --> 00:11:20,083
-and her uncle for that matter.
-Actually,

307
00:11:20,125 --> 00:11:21,875
have you told her
about your software?

308
00:11:21,917 --> 00:11:22,917
No, software?

309
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:25,083
He's got this privacy software.

310
00:11:25,125 --> 00:11:26,375
Keeps people from stealing
your stuff-- tell her, pal.

311
00:11:26,417 --> 00:11:29,375
Maeby tried
to hide her jealousy.

312
00:11:29,417 --> 00:11:32,166
So it's privacy software
that's also antipiracy?

313
00:11:32,208 --> 00:11:33,959
Do you have a way of doing this?

314
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,417
Well, it's just a Boolean-driven
aggregation, really,

315
00:11:36,458 --> 00:11:38,875
of what programmers call
"hacker-traps..."

316
00:11:38,917 --> 00:11:41,041
But as she listened
to her cousin discuss

317
00:11:41,083 --> 00:11:44,500
computer technology
she had no understanding of,

318
00:11:44,542 --> 00:11:48,083
she lost that feeling
of superiority,

319
00:11:48,125 --> 00:11:49,500
and her self-esteem plummeted

320
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:51,959
as she started
to question the entirety

321
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,041
of what she had done
with her life

322
00:11:54,083 --> 00:11:55,917
for the last several years.

323
00:11:55,959 --> 00:11:59,083
...and they want to steal
your music and copy your movies

324
00:11:59,125 --> 00:12:02,083
or-or just look at your photos--
you know, this prevents that.

325
00:12:02,125 --> 00:12:04,417
It just neutralizes that
so it's not even a threat.

326
00:12:04,458 --> 00:12:06,083
It's called Fakeblock.

327
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:07,458
-Great name.
-Yeah, well, you know, it's

328
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:09,458
super low-hanging fruit.
Someone's gonna do it.

329
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:11,250
We're just trying
to be those guys, you know.

330
00:12:11,291 --> 00:12:12,542
I don't understand
a word of it, but it works.

331
00:12:12,583 --> 00:12:14,041
You should see
his Facebook page.

332
00:12:14,083 --> 00:12:16,000
Doesn't have a friend on it.

333
00:12:16,041 --> 00:12:17,417
<i>Of course, that last part</i>

334
00:12:17,458 --> 00:12:19,500
<i>had nothing to do with</i>
<i>Fakeblock...</i>

335
00:12:19,542 --> 00:12:20,917
Thank you, Dad.

336
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:24,250
<i>...but it did help</i>
<i>George Michael's self-esteem.</i>

337
00:12:26,583 --> 00:12:28,333
NARRATOR:
<i>Maeby was feeling discouraged</i>

338
00:12:28,375 --> 00:12:30,166
<i>as she got back on the bus</i>
<i>for high school.</i>

339
00:12:30,208 --> 00:12:33,125
Hey, you want to get high
with us behind the gym?

340
00:12:33,166 --> 00:12:34,458
Wait, we don't know her.

341
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:36,125
I hear there's an undercover cop
at school.

342
00:12:36,166 --> 00:12:37,959
Can you imagine
what kind of loser pretends

343
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,959
to be in high school
when they're in their 20s?

344
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,291
Well, it's pretty gutsy, right?

345
00:12:41,333 --> 00:12:44,208
I mean, it's better
to take the risk, right?

346
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:46,000
-Yeah, maybe you're right.
-Yeah, maybe you're right.

347
00:12:47,041 --> 00:12:49,083
BOTH:
Cop.

348
00:12:49,125 --> 00:12:50,291
Hey, how was your tutor?
He's not gonna

349
00:12:50,333 --> 00:12:51,417
take you away from me, is he?

350
00:12:51,458 --> 00:12:52,417
Well, not until
his software hits

351
00:12:52,458 --> 00:12:54,375
and he can buy me an apartment.

352
00:12:54,417 --> 00:12:56,125
I'm living in a (bleep)hole.

353
00:12:56,166 --> 00:12:57,291
I hear they're hiring
at Chipotle.

354
00:12:57,333 --> 00:12:59,291
<i>And that's when Maeby realized</i>

355
00:12:59,333 --> 00:13:02,166
<i>maybe she should have graduated</i>
<i>high school.</i>

356
00:13:02,208 --> 00:13:03,458
Can I get a Macallan 12 neat?

357
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:06,000
-Water back.
-I.D.?

358
00:13:06,041 --> 00:13:08,375
Actually, can we make it--
uh, marry me--

359
00:13:08,417 --> 00:13:09,542
a Wild Turkey?

360
00:13:09,583 --> 00:13:11,166
I still need to see some I.D.

361
00:13:11,208 --> 00:13:13,208
-Right. There you go.
-Thank you.

362
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:15,000
I'm supposed to believe
you're 17?

363
00:13:15,041 --> 00:13:16,500
Oh, no, sorry.

364
00:13:16,542 --> 00:13:18,375
That's my fake for sneaking
back into high school.

365
00:13:18,417 --> 00:13:20,083
Here we go-- 23.

366
00:13:20,125 --> 00:13:21,500
Oh, you're Maeby.
Well, you can have one,

367
00:13:21,542 --> 00:13:23,208
but you got quite a bar tab.

368
00:13:25,125 --> 00:13:27,125
MAEBY:
I got to graduate.

369
00:13:27,166 --> 00:13:29,083
I mean, I got to start bringing
some cash in, you know.

370
00:13:29,125 --> 00:13:30,625
-Yeah.
-Everyone's just passing me by.

371
00:13:30,667 --> 00:13:33,041
George Michael, Kitty Sanchez.

372
00:13:33,083 --> 00:13:35,000
CARTER:
Drinks for the house.

373
00:13:35,041 --> 00:13:36,333
-(laughter)
-This guy?

374
00:13:36,375 --> 00:13:38,083
These guys are making
a fortune off that

375
00:13:38,125 --> 00:13:39,500
"To Entrap a Local Predator "
show they're on.

376
00:13:39,542 --> 00:13:40,583
TAYLOR:
Were.

377
00:13:40,625 --> 00:13:42,291
Won't let us shoot in Laguna.

378
00:13:42,333 --> 00:13:44,583
Are you guys looking
for a new bait house?

379
00:13:44,625 --> 00:13:46,166
<i>And that's how</i>
<i>she made enough money</i>

380
00:13:46,208 --> 00:13:48,291
<i>to at least pay</i>
<i>for her bar tab.</i>

381
00:13:48,333 --> 00:13:49,375
PERFECTO:
Hey, guys.

382
00:13:49,417 --> 00:13:51,041
-Hey, Perfecto!
-Hey.

383
00:13:51,083 --> 00:13:52,542
Isn't this guy a little
too young to be in here?

384
00:13:52,583 --> 00:13:54,542
No, no, no, he's with us.

385
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:56,375
<i>But later, when returning</i>
<i>from the restroom,</i>

386
00:13:56,417 --> 00:13:58,542
<i>-she noticed this.</i>
-BARTENDER: So, you fitting in

387
00:13:58,583 --> 00:14:00,542
-over there at the high school?
-He's a cop.

388
00:14:00,583 --> 00:14:01,583
BARTENDER:
They accepting you?

389
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:06,417
<i>And as she returned to the</i>
<i>high school for eighth period,</i>

390
00:14:06,458 --> 00:14:09,208
<i>even getting a diploma</i>
<i>seemed to be in jeopardy.</i>

391
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:11,208
Barry?

392
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:13,041
Maeby, you scared
the be-(bleep) out of me.

393
00:14:13,083 --> 00:14:15,041
What are you doing here?

394
00:14:15,083 --> 00:14:16,333
Well, I could ask you
the same thing.

395
00:14:16,375 --> 00:14:18,125
I go to high school here.

396
00:14:18,166 --> 00:14:19,542
I could answer the same thing.

397
00:14:19,583 --> 00:14:21,208
I was just looking
for something more believable.

398
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:23,375
Speaking of believable,
I was going to ask you

399
00:14:23,417 --> 00:14:24,500
a question about that.

400
00:14:24,542 --> 00:14:26,041
Um, can somebody get kicked out

401
00:14:26,083 --> 00:14:27,417
of high school
if they're too old?

402
00:14:27,458 --> 00:14:29,208
I think I was made at a bar.

403
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:31,625
I know this part of the law
very, very well.

404
00:14:31,667 --> 00:14:34,417
After 21, it is illegal
for you to enroll

405
00:14:34,458 --> 00:14:36,542
in high school
in the state of California.

406
00:14:36,583 --> 00:14:38,709
As a matter of fact,
you cannot even lurk.

407
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:40,291
(scoffs)
"Lurk."

408
00:14:40,333 --> 00:14:41,583
What, do they got
cameras in the bushes?

409
00:14:41,625 --> 00:14:43,542
Why would they do that?
You can't even

410
00:14:43,583 --> 00:14:45,291
see into the locker rooms
from there.

411
00:14:45,333 --> 00:14:47,625
Okay, so what do I do?
Because the guy who caught me

412
00:14:47,667 --> 00:14:49,625
-goes to school with me.
-Oh, well, that's easy.

413
00:14:49,667 --> 00:14:52,709
You get something
incriminating on him.

414
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:55,166
Call me in the office,
we'll discuss it,

415
00:14:55,208 --> 00:14:56,542
and then I can also
keep a record,

416
00:14:56,583 --> 00:14:58,291
you know,
for billing and so forth.

417
00:14:58,333 --> 00:15:00,166
Yeah, well, maybe I'll just keep
a record of it, too,

418
00:15:00,208 --> 00:15:01,709
so I can follow up
with my own bill.

419
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:03,417
(laughs):
Oh, very good.

420
00:15:03,458 --> 00:15:06,125
You should be the lawyer.
Very good. Pro bono.

421
00:15:06,166 --> 00:15:07,583
<i>Knowing that she could</i>
<i>very well</i>

422
00:15:07,625 --> 00:15:09,291
<i>be kicked out of school,</i>

423
00:15:09,333 --> 00:15:11,583
<i>Maeby went in search</i>
<i>of an overdue check</i>

424
00:15:11,625 --> 00:15:13,250
<i>at the penthouse.</i>

425
00:15:13,291 --> 00:15:15,166
<i>And as she was</i>
<i>checking out the mail...</i>

426
00:15:15,208 --> 00:15:16,750
-(ostrich squawking)
-Oh, my God!

427
00:15:16,792 --> 00:15:20,125
<i>...she ran into an ostrich</i>
<i>in heat</i>

428
00:15:20,166 --> 00:15:21,458
<i>-that was interested</i>
-Here, that way, that way.

429
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:23,375
<i>in checking out the female.</i>

430
00:15:23,417 --> 00:15:25,458
And she wouldn't even
let me get a cat.

431
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:27,250
<i>And after freeing the ostrich</i>

432
00:15:27,291 --> 00:15:30,458
<i>to eventually find love</i>
<i>on the adjoining balcony,</i>

433
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:34,458
<i>she was back searching for</i>
<i>a long overdue royalty check.</i>

434
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,750
<i>In fact, it had arrived</i>
<i>one day earlier.</i>

435
00:15:36,792 --> 00:15:40,500
"From Gangie for facelift"?
Mother.

436
00:15:40,542 --> 00:15:43,417
<i>But she did find</i>
<i>that she was being honored</i>

437
00:15:43,458 --> 00:15:45,417
<i>at an award show dedicated</i>
<i>to the achievements</i>

438
00:15:45,458 --> 00:15:48,417
<i>of young people</i>
<i>in the entertainment business.</i>

439
00:15:48,458 --> 00:15:50,291
<i>I'm getting an Opie?</i>

440
00:15:50,333 --> 00:15:52,291
<i>And it did boost her esteem.</i>

441
00:15:52,333 --> 00:15:54,667
-Hey.
<i>-The only bigger honor</i>

442
00:15:54,709 --> 00:15:56,625
<i>would be having</i>
<i>an award like that</i>

443
00:15:56,667 --> 00:15:58,667
<i>named after you, I guess.</i>

444
00:15:58,709 --> 00:16:00,458
<i>Days later, however,</i>

445
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,667
<i>she was called</i>
<i>to Donny Richter's classroom.</i>

446
00:16:02,709 --> 00:16:04,500
-Hey, you wanted to see me?
-Mm, yeah.

447
00:16:04,542 --> 00:16:06,333
I got you tacos.

448
00:16:06,375 --> 00:16:08,333
I hope that's okay,
because you're

449
00:16:08,375 --> 00:16:10,500
going to sit here
through lunch and study.

450
00:16:10,542 --> 00:16:11,667
No, I can't. I can't.

451
00:16:11,709 --> 00:16:13,792
Young lady, you better
pull it together

452
00:16:13,834 --> 00:16:15,500
or you're not going to graduate.

453
00:16:15,542 --> 00:16:17,500
What is it going to take
to get you to focus?

454
00:16:17,542 --> 00:16:18,667
Are you on drugs?

455
00:16:18,709 --> 00:16:20,333
Because, from what I hear,

456
00:16:20,375 --> 00:16:22,458
there might be an undercover cop
at this school.

457
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:24,333
In fact,
it was an undercover cop

458
00:16:24,375 --> 00:16:26,500
she was searching
for a way to incriminate.

459
00:16:26,542 --> 00:16:28,417
How long do you want
to stay in high school?

460
00:16:28,458 --> 00:16:30,709
-You're 17.
-And that's when she remembered

461
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:33,375
that Perfecto thought
she was 17, too.

462
00:16:33,417 --> 00:16:35,792
You know what?
I think I will do better

463
00:16:35,834 --> 00:16:38,375
once I get
a little Mexican in me.

464
00:16:42,417 --> 00:16:45,375
NARRATOR: Maeby got her cousin
to drive her to the Opies

465
00:16:45,417 --> 00:16:47,709
so she could impress him
with her achievements.

466
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:49,750
Well, I'm going to go mingle
with a bunch of 13-year-olds

467
00:16:49,792 --> 00:16:51,542
who think they can still
play fifth grade.

468
00:16:51,583 --> 00:16:53,250
-Have fun.
-I'll catch up.

469
00:16:53,291 --> 00:16:55,375
<i>-And Maeby ran into her old</i>
-Oh, my gosh.

470
00:16:55,417 --> 00:16:57,583
<i>-studio boss, Mort Meyers.</i>
-As I live and breathe.

471
00:16:57,625 --> 00:16:58,792
I'm actually getting

472
00:16:58,834 --> 00:17:00,375
the lifetime achievement Opie
tonight.

473
00:17:00,417 --> 00:17:01,583
I'm very sorry.

474
00:17:01,625 --> 00:17:02,834
-(laughs): Yeah.
-No,

475
00:17:02,875 --> 00:17:04,458
they only give that award away

476
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,208
to somebody after they die or,

477
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:07,834
even worse,
after your career is dead.

478
00:17:07,875 --> 00:17:09,333
Really?

479
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:10,709
Well, consider yourself lucky.

480
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:12,834
They told you
your career was over.

481
00:17:12,875 --> 00:17:15,375
I didn't find out until I was
locked out of my office,

482
00:17:15,417 --> 00:17:17,625
'cause, see,
I passed on "Hunger Games."

483
00:17:17,667 --> 00:17:19,834
-Mm. -It wasn't the most
graceful of exits.

484
00:17:19,875 --> 00:17:21,583
That's the way
the cookie crumbles.

485
00:17:21,625 --> 00:17:23,291
This is for you.

486
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:25,417
Thanks, man.

487
00:17:25,458 --> 00:17:26,583
No, actually,

488
00:17:26,625 --> 00:17:27,875
the exit was pretty graceful.

489
00:17:27,917 --> 00:17:29,625
I think I just remember it
that way

490
00:17:29,667 --> 00:17:31,667
'cause it got dicey
when I was sneaking back in

491
00:17:31,709 --> 00:17:33,625
to take a (bleep) on Sid's desk.

492
00:17:33,667 --> 00:17:35,709
(grunting)

493
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:38,458
(strained grunting)

494
00:17:39,917 --> 00:17:41,583
But do what I do.

495
00:17:41,625 --> 00:17:44,250
When they kick you out
of the business, save face

496
00:17:44,291 --> 00:17:46,750
by starting
your own Internet company.

497
00:17:46,792 --> 00:17:48,583
We're having
a big announcement today.

498
00:17:48,625 --> 00:17:49,750
You started an Internet company?

499
00:17:49,792 --> 00:17:51,417
It's the real deal.

500
00:17:51,458 --> 00:17:53,291
It's a system that automates
provisioning...

501
00:17:53,333 --> 00:17:55,333
NARRATOR: And once again,
she found herself with someone

502
00:17:55,375 --> 00:17:57,625
who had not only moved on
with their life,

503
00:17:57,667 --> 00:18:00,291
but done so in ways
she couldn't understand.

504
00:18:00,333 --> 00:18:01,667
...overseas financial
transactions.

505
00:18:01,709 --> 00:18:03,750
-It's called Schnoodle.
-Schnoodle?

506
00:18:03,792 --> 00:18:05,875
Take a hat;
we got 18,000 of them.

507
00:18:05,917 --> 00:18:07,583
<i>And that's when Maeby</i>
<i>ran into a friend</i>

508
00:18:07,625 --> 00:18:08,875
<i>she knew from her days</i>
<i>at Imagine.</i>

509
00:18:08,917 --> 00:18:10,291
Rebel.

510
00:18:10,333 --> 00:18:11,625
-Hi. How are you?
-In hell.

511
00:18:11,667 --> 00:18:13,291
Ah, I hate the Opies.

512
00:18:13,333 --> 00:18:15,458
But whenever Bryce gets
pregnant, guess who gets a call?

513
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:17,583
And you're getting the lifetime
achievement award, huh?

514
00:18:17,625 --> 00:18:19,834
You know, I can laugh about it,
I can laugh

515
00:18:19,875 --> 00:18:21,625
because I'm actually
on the upswing.

516
00:18:21,667 --> 00:18:23,458
I was just telling Mort here

517
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:25,500
that I've actually started
my own Internet company.

518
00:18:25,542 --> 00:18:26,750
I was just about to tell you.

519
00:18:26,792 --> 00:18:28,291
Well, if you need a name,

520
00:18:28,333 --> 00:18:30,500
I'm the guy who came up
with Schnoodle.

521
00:18:30,542 --> 00:18:32,333
-How do we know each other?
-We don't.

522
00:18:32,375 --> 00:18:33,458
That's what it is.

523
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:34,583
Well, Schnoodle's dead.

524
00:18:34,625 --> 00:18:35,667
Fakeblock is the next big thing.

525
00:18:35,709 --> 00:18:37,083
It's called Fakeblock.

526
00:18:37,125 --> 00:18:38,834
What's this? You're talking...
talking about Fakeblock?

527
00:18:38,875 --> 00:18:41,208
Yes. Your privacy software.

528
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:43,709
Oh. How does your privacy
software work?

529
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:45,709
-Huh? It's private.
-Yes...

530
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:47,375
Can I talk to you
for a second, please?

531
00:18:47,417 --> 00:18:48,959
-Yes. 
-I don't want people
to know that I'm doing this.

532
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,583
Everybody has to know
about this, okay?

533
00:18:50,625 --> 00:18:51,875
This could be big for me.

534
00:18:51,917 --> 00:18:54,375
I could make Fakeblock huge.

535
00:18:54,417 --> 00:18:56,458
No, no, Maeby,
there is no company.

536
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:58,333
Fakeblock is just a software
that I'm developing.

537
00:18:58,375 --> 00:19:00,542
And the whole point
is that it's private.

538
00:19:00,583 --> 00:19:02,750
So you can't be telling people
about it.

539
00:19:02,792 --> 00:19:04,500
No, we got to tell people
about it.

540
00:19:04,542 --> 00:19:06,333
I just got a lifetime
achievement award.

541
00:19:06,375 --> 00:19:07,667
I'm finished.

542
00:19:07,709 --> 00:19:09,333
And also,
I think you should consider

543
00:19:09,375 --> 00:19:10,667
calling it "The" Fakeblock.

544
00:19:10,709 --> 00:19:12,417
It's cleaner.

545
00:19:12,458 --> 00:19:14,500
-Like "The Netflick."
-It-It's just not ready.

546
00:19:14,542 --> 00:19:16,583
Okay, there's still a bunch
of programming problems.

547
00:19:16,625 --> 00:19:17,834
You can get it ready,
George Michael.

548
00:19:17,875 --> 00:19:19,625
What, you think they invite
the animals

549
00:19:19,667 --> 00:19:21,500
and ask them to wait
while they build the zoo?

550
00:19:21,542 --> 00:19:23,625
No, that would be a bloodbath.

551
00:19:23,667 --> 00:19:25,583
Yeah, a total (bleep) bloodbath.

552
00:19:25,625 --> 00:19:27,375
We have no money
to start a business.

553
00:19:27,417 --> 00:19:28,750
Don't worry,
I'll get the ball rolling

554
00:19:28,792 --> 00:19:31,625
with some free publicity
when I accept my award.

555
00:19:31,667 --> 00:19:33,875
Come on, this could be
my only chance to be a Harris.

556
00:19:33,917 --> 00:19:35,542
-A Harris?
-All right, fine.

557
00:19:35,583 --> 00:19:37,542
You can still be the boss, okay?

558
00:19:37,583 --> 00:19:38,959
I just don't want people to know
that I'm working with my cousin.

559
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,917
So, you are not my cousin.

560
00:19:40,959 --> 00:19:43,500
You are not
George Michael Bluth.

561
00:19:43,542 --> 00:19:45,000
I'm great with that.

562
00:19:45,041 --> 00:19:47,375
In fact, you know what might
really help us sell it...

563
00:19:47,417 --> 00:19:50,709
Oh, heiress. You meant...
You don't pronounce the "H."

564
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:53,000
-And that's not what heiress
means. 
-I pronounce the "H."

565
00:19:53,041 --> 00:19:54,834
No, but that's not how
the word is...

566
00:19:54,875 --> 00:19:56,625
You know, we say words the way
we say them for a reason.

567
00:19:56,667 --> 00:19:58,417
So what is this?

568
00:19:58,458 --> 00:20:00,500
Is this another one of these
social networking things?

569
00:20:00,542 --> 00:20:01,917
Because I am so over those.

570
00:20:01,959 --> 00:20:04,667
I tried to deactivate
my Facebook profile.

571
00:20:04,709 --> 00:20:07,709
It's easier to get out
of Scientology.

572
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:09,792
Well, this is actually
the opposite of Facebook.

573
00:20:09,834 --> 00:20:11,625
It's the antisocial network.

574
00:20:11,667 --> 00:20:13,583
It prevents piracy, right?

575
00:20:13,625 --> 00:20:14,875
-Really?
-Mm-hmm.

576
00:20:14,917 --> 00:20:16,917
Rebel Alley.

577
00:20:16,959 --> 00:20:18,667
George Mi... Harris.

578
00:20:18,709 --> 00:20:20,834
George Maharis, huh?

579
00:20:20,875 --> 00:20:23,834
<i>And that's how George Michael</i>
<i>finally got that new name.</i>

580
00:20:23,875 --> 00:20:26,417
<i>It felt like a good fit--</i>
<i>strong, rugged...</i>

581
00:20:26,458 --> 00:20:27,834
-Yes.
<i>-...untainted.</i>

582
00:20:27,875 --> 00:20:29,750
Yes, George Maharis.

583
00:20:29,792 --> 00:20:31,917
-Perfecto.
-De nada.

584
00:20:31,959 --> 00:20:34,792
That's my undercover
cop boyfriend.

585
00:20:34,834 --> 00:20:36,417
I'm trying to get him in bed.

586
00:20:36,458 --> 00:20:38,542
<i>And Maeby set to work</i>
<i>in trapping him</i>

587
00:20:38,583 --> 00:20:41,417
<i>-into becoming a predator.</i>
-Hey. I know why you're here.

588
00:20:41,458 --> 00:20:43,000
Promise me you won't tell anyone
at school.

589
00:20:43,041 --> 00:20:45,041
I'm just a huge fan
of teen stars.

590
00:20:45,083 --> 00:20:46,834
-Yeah. That's very convincing.
-Yeah.

591
00:20:46,875 --> 00:20:48,834
You're a better actor
than most of the kids here.

592
00:20:48,875 --> 00:20:51,375
-Even Zack and Cody.
-Are they here?

593
00:20:51,417 --> 00:20:52,834
I thought they were filming
a movie in Maui.

594
00:20:52,875 --> 00:20:55,625
Look, I may only be 17,
Perfecto,

595
00:20:55,667 --> 00:20:56,792
but I know you're a cop.

596
00:20:56,834 --> 00:20:58,709
Yeah, there it is,
that cop stare.

597
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:01,083
I got to tell you,
I find it very sexy.

598
00:21:01,125 --> 00:21:04,834
Okay. Okay, all right.

599
00:21:04,875 --> 00:21:07,583
I'm a cop.
I'm working here undercover.

600
00:21:07,625 --> 00:21:09,458
We're hunting down an ex-CIA
operative named Esteves

601
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:10,709
who's gone rogue, and...

602
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:12,875
It's the kids
from "Modern Family."

603
00:21:12,917 --> 00:21:15,625
Sorry.
He's become a drug kingpin

604
00:21:15,667 --> 00:21:17,500
and his son goes to Newport.
There's something going down

605
00:21:17,542 --> 00:21:18,959
tonight or possibly even
at Cinco and that...

606
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,792
Rico!

607
00:21:20,834 --> 00:21:22,667
Wow, you are good.

608
00:21:22,709 --> 00:21:25,000
I have to be--
young lives depend on it.

609
00:21:26,792 --> 00:21:27,834
To be continued.

610
00:21:27,875 --> 00:21:30,000
You better believe it.

611
00:21:30,041 --> 00:21:31,834
Rico!

612
00:21:31,875 --> 00:21:34,500
<i>On her way to accept</i>
<i>her award, however,</i>

613
00:21:34,542 --> 00:21:37,000
<i>figuring she wouldn't be</i>
<i>at an event like this again,</i>

614
00:21:37,041 --> 00:21:40,083
<i>she stopped for</i>
<i>some coconut shrimp.</i>

615
00:21:40,125 --> 00:21:44,500
<i>But narrowly missed the $50,000</i>
<i>check with her name on it</i>

616
00:21:44,542 --> 00:21:46,917
<i>that her mother gave</i>
<i>to her grandfather...</i>

617
00:21:49,709 --> 00:21:51,500
<i>-...who gave it to this man.</i>
-Got the check.

618
00:21:51,542 --> 00:21:53,500
<i>-Who gave it to this man.</i>
-Oh, man.

619
00:21:53,542 --> 00:21:55,000
-Whoa.
-Oh.

620
00:21:55,041 --> 00:21:56,750
<i>Although, in that moment,</i>

621
00:21:56,792 --> 00:21:58,000
<i>she did gain some respect</i>
<i>for her mother</i>

622
00:21:58,041 --> 00:22:00,041
...a random act
of senseless nonviolence.

623
00:22:00,083 --> 00:22:02,000
<i>And perhaps that's why</i>
<i>she chose to share</i>

624
00:22:02,041 --> 00:22:03,834
<i>-her problems with her.</i>
-So, what are you doing here?

625
00:22:03,875 --> 00:22:05,834
I'm getting a lifetime
achievement award

626
00:22:05,875 --> 00:22:08,000
for my work
in the entertainment business.

627
00:22:08,041 --> 00:22:09,667
I tried.

628
00:22:09,709 --> 00:22:11,542
Tell your therapist I tried.

629
00:22:11,583 --> 00:22:14,083
I'm not in therapy!

630
00:22:14,125 --> 00:22:16,000
Then I must have done
something right.

631
00:22:16,041 --> 00:22:18,542
<i>And soon, she was saying</i>
<i>farewell to Hollywood</i>

632
00:22:18,583 --> 00:22:20,792
<i>in a way she hoped</i>
<i>they'd remember.</i>

633
00:22:20,834 --> 00:22:22,625
Thank you, Kirk Cameron,

634
00:22:22,667 --> 00:22:25,041
for that incredibly
Bibley introduction.

635
00:22:25,083 --> 00:22:27,834
Okay, so tie yourself
to your chair,

636
00:22:27,875 --> 00:22:30,125
because this is going to be
a rough (bleep) ride.

637
00:22:30,166 --> 00:22:32,583
I'm leaving this (bleep)
dying business

638
00:22:32,625 --> 00:22:34,542
to join the software game.

639
00:22:34,583 --> 00:22:36,083
Double (bleep) newsflash.

640
00:22:36,125 --> 00:22:38,875
I'm starting Fakeblock
with George Maharis,

641
00:22:38,917 --> 00:22:40,583
the world's first
antisocial network.

642
00:22:40,625 --> 00:22:42,625
So you know what?
You can take this Opie

643
00:22:42,667 --> 00:22:44,792
and shove it up your (bleep),
all right?

644
00:22:44,834 --> 00:22:46,750
Because I will (bleep) punt
the next god(bleep) (bleep)

645
00:22:46,792 --> 00:22:49,041
who tells me I'm finished,
you (bleep) (bleep)hats.

646
00:22:49,083 --> 00:22:50,875
So you can all
go (bleep) yourselves!

647
00:22:50,917 --> 00:22:53,750
What? Sure.

648
00:22:53,792 --> 00:22:57,125
Please welcome the talented
voices of Phineas and Ferb.

649
00:22:57,166 --> 00:22:59,250
Go (bleep) yourself!

650
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:02,750
(bleep) you.

651
00:23:02,792 --> 00:23:05,875
<i>And although she was pursued,</i>
<i>she was able to shake security</i>

652
00:23:05,917 --> 00:23:08,083
<i>when a bigger problem occurred.</i>

653
00:23:08,125 --> 00:23:10,583
-(explosion)
-Right this way, sir.

654
00:23:10,625 --> 00:23:13,917
<i>And after the explosion,</i>
<i>Maeby saw her mother</i>

655
00:23:13,959 --> 00:23:16,875
<i>whoring out her principles,</i>
<i>and quickly lost the respect</i>

656
00:23:16,917 --> 00:23:18,125
<i>-she had briefly held...</i>
-I'd like that very much.

657
00:23:18,166 --> 00:23:19,709
Sir, the press awaits.

658
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:21,083
<i>...and decided to call her</i>
<i>on it.</i>

659
00:23:21,125 --> 00:23:22,917
Are you really gonna
whore yourself out like that?

660
00:23:22,959 --> 00:23:24,917
-I am not a whore.
-Yeah, you're a whore.

661
00:23:24,959 --> 00:23:26,750
<i>As it turns out,</i>
<i>the exchange was</i>

662
00:23:26,792 --> 00:23:28,667
<i>witnessed by Herbert Love's</i>
<i>campaign manager,</i>

663
00:23:28,709 --> 00:23:30,917
<i>who, in possession of</i>
<i>a third-party check</i>

664
00:23:30,959 --> 00:23:33,000
<i>from "Gangie IV: Face Lift,"</i>

665
00:23:33,041 --> 00:23:35,959
<i>was looking to trade</i>
<i>some greenbacks for a redhead.</i>

666
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,166
Ma'am, is she yours?

667
00:23:37,208 --> 00:23:39,125
Unfortunately.

668
00:23:39,166 --> 00:23:40,959
Herbert Love would like
to see her.

669
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,625
You can arrange that?

670
00:23:42,667 --> 00:23:45,000
Obviously,
discretion is appreciated.

671
00:23:45,041 --> 00:23:46,834
<i>And that's how Maeby</i>
<i>got both the seed money</i>

672
00:23:46,875 --> 00:23:49,792
-for her company...
-I'm the discreetiest.

673
00:23:49,834 --> 00:23:52,125
<i>And just to be clear, I want</i>
<i>to hire her for prostitution.</i>

674
00:23:52,166 --> 00:23:53,792
Yes, no, definitely.

675
00:23:53,834 --> 00:23:55,750
That was clear.
I'm gonna charge you for that.

676
00:23:55,792 --> 00:23:57,834
<i>...and became</i>
<i>her mother's pimp.</i>

677
00:23:57,875 --> 00:24:00,083
<i>Of course,</i>
<i>the plan required getting back</i>

678
00:24:00,125 --> 00:24:02,709
<i>into her mother's good graces</i>
<i>to trick her</i>

679
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:04,792
<i>-into turning a trick.</i>
-Hi, sweetie.

680
00:24:04,834 --> 00:24:07,125
Free... bie. Hi.

681
00:24:07,166 --> 00:24:08,625
<i>But the universe seemed</i>
<i>to like the plan.</i>

682
00:24:08,667 --> 00:24:09,875
<i>And that's how Maeby was able</i>

683
00:24:09,917 --> 00:24:11,625
<i>to get her mother</i>
<i>to meet Herbert</i>

684
00:24:11,667 --> 00:24:13,125
<i>at the club</i>
<i>that Maeby still belonged to.</i>

685
00:24:13,166 --> 00:24:15,125
...I could never call him.

686
00:24:15,166 --> 00:24:17,166
I could call him for you.

687
00:24:17,208 --> 00:24:19,166
<i>Technically, she still needed</i>
<i>to talk her mother</i>

688
00:24:19,208 --> 00:24:21,250
<i>into having sex with him.</i>

689
00:24:21,291 --> 00:24:24,208
<i>But this was a woman who once</i>
<i>wore this to a men's prison,</i>

690
00:24:24,250 --> 00:24:27,250
<i>so she felt she'd be okay.</i>

691
00:24:27,291 --> 00:24:29,166
<i>-And soon, she was pimping out</i>
-Can you believe this?

692
00:24:29,208 --> 00:24:32,208
<i>George Michael's</i>
<i>software company as well.</i>

693
00:24:32,250 --> 00:24:34,000
Fakeblock-- it's exploding.

694
00:24:34,041 --> 00:24:35,709
I got my P.R. company
fanning it.

695
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:37,667
I even got it to the attention
of Jim Cramer.

696
00:24:37,709 --> 00:24:38,834
Jim Cramer?

697
00:24:38,875 --> 00:24:40,709
He's a guy I've worked with,

698
00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:42,250
and he even mentioned it
on "Mad Money."

699
00:24:42,291 --> 00:24:44,834
<i>This Fakeblock thing</i>
<i>is poised to explode!</i>

700
00:24:44,875 --> 00:24:48,000
<i>I never do this, hell,</i>
<i>it's not even a stock yet.</i>

701
00:24:48,041 --> 00:24:49,834
<i>For all I know,</i>
<i>it's not even real!</i>

702
00:24:49,875 --> 00:24:52,166
<i>But I think this might be</i>
<i>going through the roof!</i>

703
00:24:52,208 --> 00:24:56,000
<i>I'm calling it my first</i>
<i>"Hypothetical Buy."</i>

704
00:24:56,041 --> 00:24:57,250
(bull bellows)

705
00:24:57,291 --> 00:24:58,250
<i>And this weekend,</i>
<i>don't forget to catch me</i>

706
00:24:58,291 --> 00:25:00,041
<i>on "Gangie IV."</i>
<i>Here's a taste.</i>

707
00:25:00,083 --> 00:25:01,959
<i>This old lady's crazy!</i>

708
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,083
<i>I'm raising the alert level</i>
<i>from "Don't Leave the House"</i>

709
00:25:05,125 --> 00:25:09,041
<i>to "Board Up Your Windows!"</i>

710
00:25:09,083 --> 00:25:11,041
<i>Over the following days,</i>
<i>Maeby was able</i>

711
00:25:11,083 --> 00:25:13,917
<i>to discreetly bring in cash</i>
<i>from Herbert Love</i>

712
00:25:13,959 --> 00:25:16,792
<i>for services she got her mother</i>
<i>to unknowingly render.</i>

713
00:25:16,834 --> 00:25:20,250
Well, why don't you take him out
to dinner?

714
00:25:20,291 --> 00:25:22,291
Hmm? Guys who are used
to being charged--

715
00:25:22,333 --> 00:25:24,083
I mean in charge,

716
00:25:24,125 --> 00:25:26,750
sometimes like it when the other
person takes control.

717
00:25:26,792 --> 00:25:29,208
Hmm. Well, maybe I will.

718
00:25:29,250 --> 00:25:30,959
How about
the Balboa Yacht Club, huh?

719
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,959
-Put it on the family tab.
-Of course.

720
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,041
All right, have fun.
I wish I could go out to dinner.

721
00:25:36,208 --> 00:25:37,834
What am I doing?
This is disgusting.

722
00:25:37,875 --> 00:25:39,333
I've got money coming in.

723
00:25:39,375 --> 00:25:41,208
<i>All the while putting money</i>
<i>into the company...</i>

724
00:25:41,250 --> 00:25:44,000
...ultimate privacy on the Web
until now.

725
00:25:44,041 --> 00:25:46,083
If you don't believe me,
do a something search on it.

726
00:25:46,125 --> 00:25:49,041
<i>...and bringing in more cash</i>
<i>as a result--</i>

727
00:25:49,083 --> 00:25:52,750
<i>her self-esteem growing</i>
<i>every day.</i>

728
00:25:52,792 --> 00:25:54,250
<i>Soon, she had enough money</i>

729
00:25:54,291 --> 00:25:57,375
<i>for an apartment and to set up</i>
<i>a Fakeblock office.</i>

730
00:25:57,417 --> 00:26:00,959
Right. Um, do you want
some stock options?

731
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,917
Yeah? All right, well,
split it up with everyone.

732
00:26:02,959 --> 00:26:04,875
That's for everybody.

733
00:26:04,917 --> 00:26:08,208
<i>She even got George Michael</i>
<i>a cool retro company car.</i>

734
00:26:08,250 --> 00:26:11,000
-Hey. -Hi. You actually
rented a little office.

735
00:26:11,041 --> 00:26:13,000
Yeah. I don't want you to see
it yet. Still setting it up.

736
00:26:13,041 --> 00:26:16,125
With a little help from a
wealthy benefactor, Lucille 2.

737
00:26:16,166 --> 00:26:18,291
-Oh, Gangie.
-No, Lucille 2.

738
00:26:18,333 --> 00:26:19,834
Austero.

739
00:26:19,875 --> 00:26:21,750
I don't know who that is.

740
00:26:21,792 --> 00:26:23,333
You don't?

741
00:26:23,375 --> 00:26:25,208
Never met the woman.

742
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:27,792
Well, she'll be the one driving
the staircar from now on.

743
00:26:27,834 --> 00:26:29,959
-It was part of the deal.
-You gave her my car?

744
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,792
Yeah, it's technically
hers anyways,

745
00:26:31,834 --> 00:26:33,250
-'cause of the Bluth Company.
-Oh.

746
00:26:33,291 --> 00:26:36,208
-But I did get you her
1988 yellow Cadillac. -Yeah?

747
00:26:36,250 --> 00:26:38,166
She only uses it
to and from hip replacements.

748
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:39,959
(laughs)

749
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,250
I guess that's only funny
if you know who she is.

750
00:26:43,291 --> 00:26:45,792
<i>And with the extra cash,</i>
<i>even got around to spraying</i>

751
00:26:45,834 --> 00:26:48,208
<i>for pests at the model home</i>
<i>where she was squatting.</i>

752
00:26:48,250 --> 00:26:51,959
<i>GOB: ...that I never got from</i>
<i>you for the last 40 years.</i>

753
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,250
Hey, so what do I owe you?

754
00:26:53,291 --> 00:26:55,125
Here you go.

755
00:26:55,166 --> 00:26:58,000
That's funny, I actually used
to date a guy named Steve Holt.

756
00:26:58,041 --> 00:26:59,959
Ha! Steve Holt!

757
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,166
Yeah, that's the guy.

758
00:27:01,208 --> 00:27:03,834
Oh...
(chuckles)

759
00:27:03,875 --> 00:27:06,041
<i>Although the house wouldn't</i>
<i>remain pest-free for long.</i>

760
00:27:06,083 --> 00:27:08,250
Heck of a birthday
this is shaping up to be.

761
00:27:08,291 --> 00:27:11,875
<i>In fact,</i>
<i>it was about to get worse.</i>

762
00:27:11,917 --> 00:27:14,083
<i>And Maeby's privacy</i>
<i>was about to get violated...</i>

763
00:27:14,125 --> 00:27:15,834
-Why did we stop?
-We hit a bug.

764
00:27:15,875 --> 00:27:17,834
<i>...when her uncles</i>
<i>barged in unannounced.</i>

765
00:27:17,875 --> 00:27:20,291
I know, I know, I've got these
things very, you know,

766
00:27:20,333 --> 00:27:22,333
-meticulously maintained.
-(bleep)

767
00:27:22,375 --> 00:27:24,083
-There's...
-There are some vultures.

768
00:27:24,125 --> 00:27:25,375
They might still smell Pete.

769
00:27:25,417 --> 00:27:27,166
<i>And she still managed</i>
<i>to continue</i>

770
00:27:27,208 --> 00:27:29,166
<i>seducing Perfecto</i>
<i>into seducing her.</i>

771
00:27:29,208 --> 00:27:30,333
I'm like, this top is
completely see-through.

772
00:27:30,375 --> 00:27:32,000
I'll put it on and show you.

773
00:27:32,041 --> 00:27:33,834
I'm like, "Where am I
supposed to wear this?"

774
00:27:33,875 --> 00:27:36,333
<i>This high school senior</i>
<i>was working three jobs.</i>

775
00:27:36,375 --> 00:27:37,375
-Okay, buh-buh-buh-buh.
-We have to be discreet.

776
00:27:37,417 --> 00:27:38,417
<i>And she did her jobs well.</i>

777
00:27:38,458 --> 00:27:40,917
-What? 
-We have to be discreet!

778
00:27:40,959 --> 00:27:42,417
-Oh, right.
<i>-And soon, it was time</i>

779
00:27:42,458 --> 00:27:45,208
<i>for Maeby to show</i>
<i>George Michael the office.</i>

780
00:27:45,250 --> 00:27:47,875
(tires screeching)

781
00:27:50,250 --> 00:27:51,875
Welcome!

782
00:27:51,917 --> 00:27:53,709
-(Mort laughs)
-I'm a softie; I hired the guy.

783
00:27:53,750 --> 00:27:55,250
He's more like a mascot
than anything.

784
00:27:55,291 --> 00:27:56,917
Mort, where's my coffee?

785
00:27:56,959 --> 00:27:59,500
Oh, damn. Oh, stupid Mort.

786
00:27:59,542 --> 00:28:01,041
I know, it's okay, just focus.

787
00:28:01,083 --> 00:28:02,208
I'm going to take the cart

788
00:28:02,250 --> 00:28:04,208
and show George Michael
his new office.

789
00:28:04,250 --> 00:28:06,125
Speechless, huh?

790
00:28:06,166 --> 00:28:07,458
How do I get back?!

791
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:09,166
Of course, when Fakeblock hits,

792
00:28:09,208 --> 00:28:11,041
we're going to have to ramp up
real fast.

793
00:28:11,083 --> 00:28:14,208
This hangar can hold
over 500 nerds!

794
00:28:14,250 --> 00:28:16,875
Maeby, we can't afford this.

795
00:28:16,917 --> 00:28:19,375
-And my software isn't even
ready. 
-Don't worry about that.

796
00:28:19,417 --> 00:28:21,041
Just worry about the app
being done in time

797
00:28:21,083 --> 00:28:22,959
for the big public unveiling
at Cinco.

798
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,125
I'll get the money.

799
00:28:24,166 --> 00:28:25,375
Isn't that in, like, three days?

800
00:28:25,417 --> 00:28:26,875
Uh, no, that's Cinco de Mayo.

801
00:28:26,917 --> 00:28:28,917
Cinco de Quatro is in two days.

802
00:28:28,959 --> 00:28:31,375
But we'll be doing it on a boat,
so I hope you don't get seasick.

803
00:28:31,417 --> 00:28:33,041
You're doing the keynote.

804
00:28:33,083 --> 00:28:36,375
You're responsible
for all of this.

805
00:28:36,417 --> 00:28:39,417
-Come on.
-Wh... No, I...

806
00:28:39,458 --> 00:28:41,917
I-I... I think we, uh...

807
00:28:41,959 --> 00:28:43,417
All of this.

808
00:28:43,458 --> 00:28:45,375
Oh, I think we should delay
the keynote.

809
00:28:45,417 --> 00:28:47,917
You know, I'd say yes,
but I don't think we can

810
00:28:47,959 --> 00:28:49,208
just because of the sheer amount
of money

811
00:28:49,250 --> 00:28:50,458
that you have on the hook
for it.

812
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:53,125
Maeby, you're fired!

813
00:28:53,166 --> 00:28:55,000
(Mort panting)

814
00:28:55,041 --> 00:28:57,000
MORT:
I got her coffee.

815
00:28:58,750 --> 00:29:02,000
NARRATOR:<i> Maeby had just lost</i>
<i>a big career option</i>

-Hey. Hey.
-Hey. Maeby.

818
00:29:05,959 --> 00:29:07,417
Wow. What are you doing here?

819
00:29:07,458 --> 00:29:09,458
I'm just here to see Lucille 2,
actually.

820
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:12,291
<i>In fact, she was there</i>
<i>to see Lucille 2's</i>

<i>so-called foster child,</i>
<i>Perfecto.</i>

822
00:29:14,583 --> 00:29:16,458
...talk to you about something
very important.

823
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:19,000
Yeah, um, Uncle Michael,

824
00:29:19,041 --> 00:29:20,458
I-I'm really sorry about
that whole

825
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:22,250
"voting you out of the dorm"
thing.

826
00:29:22,291 --> 00:29:24,458
-You know... 
-You know, we never really meant
it to...

827
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:26,083
Ah, I knew it.

828
00:29:26,125 --> 00:29:27,458
I knew you didn't understand it.

829
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:29,291
I knew you guys were all...

830
00:29:29,333 --> 00:29:31,542
'Cause I didn't...
I don't think I explained it

831
00:29:31,583 --> 00:29:33,125
very well,
and it was very, very simple.

832
00:29:33,166 --> 00:29:34,375
I made it complicated.

833
00:29:34,417 --> 00:29:36,125
It was a four-person vote.

834
00:29:36,166 --> 00:29:39,125
You see, I voted against myself,
so that P-Hound...

835
00:29:39,166 --> 00:29:41,041
And that's a way that-that
scenario would've worked out.

836
00:29:41,083 --> 00:29:42,959
What I later realized is that
there was another scenario--

837
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,125
Maeby. That there was
another scenario,

838
00:29:44,166 --> 00:29:45,542
-Yeah.
-a C scenario, scenario C,

839
00:29:45,583 --> 00:29:47,291
-where you... Okay.
-I really got to get going.

840
00:29:47,333 --> 00:29:48,959
-All right, but before
you do, 
-I got to... Yeah.

841
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,458
I just need your signature here
at the bottom.

842
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:52,166
Doing a movie about

843
00:29:52,208 --> 00:29:54,166
-the family.
-Yeah. Is that still happening?

844
00:29:54,208 --> 00:29:55,500
-What do you mean?
-I got to tell you,

845
00:29:55,542 --> 00:29:57,000
I think movies are dead.

846
00:29:57,041 --> 00:29:59,333
Maybe it's a TV show.

847
00:29:59,375 --> 00:30:02,000
-Thank you. I owe you one.
-Yeah. No, you don't.

848
00:30:02,041 --> 00:30:03,291
NARRATOR:
<i>And now a half hour late,</i>

849
00:30:03,333 --> 00:30:05,333
<i>Maeby went back to her plan</i>

850
00:30:05,375 --> 00:30:07,583
<i>of seducing an undercover cop.</i>

851
00:30:07,625 --> 00:30:09,583
<i>And that's when Lucille 2</i>

852
00:30:09,625 --> 00:30:13,208
<i>saw a very real girl</i>
<i>in her imaginary boy's room.</i>

853
00:30:14,542 --> 00:30:16,208
<i>And after,</i>
<i>secure that she had something</i>

854
00:30:16,250 --> 00:30:19,291
<i>with which</i>
<i>to blackmail Perfecto,</i>

855
00:30:19,333 --> 00:30:22,000
<i>she sought out a late payment</i>
<i>from the Love campaign</i>

856
00:30:22,041 --> 00:30:23,500
<i>at Cinco.</i>
<i>As it turns out,</i>

857
00:30:23,542 --> 00:30:26,208
<i>the Love campaign</i>
<i>had just taken care</i>

858
00:30:26,250 --> 00:30:28,000
<i>of a threat of their own.</i>

859
00:30:28,041 --> 00:30:29,417
-Why can't I do this?
<i>-And that's when</i>

860
00:30:29,458 --> 00:30:31,083
<i>Maeby ran into her mother.</i>

861
00:30:31,125 --> 00:30:32,417
Oh, Maeby.

862
00:30:32,458 --> 00:30:33,500
-Hey.
-Oh, hey.

863
00:30:33,542 --> 00:30:35,208
I need to apologize to you.

864
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:37,333
That check
you've been looking for,

865
00:30:37,375 --> 00:30:39,041
I had it.

866
00:30:39,083 --> 00:30:40,208
"Had"?

867
00:30:40,250 --> 00:30:41,375
It's not everything,

868
00:30:41,417 --> 00:30:43,208
but here's some money.

869
00:30:43,250 --> 00:30:45,542
(chuckles)
Mom, let go.

870
00:30:45,583 --> 00:30:48,333
(sighs)
It's dirty money anyway.

871
00:30:48,375 --> 00:30:49,583
Love gave it to me.

872
00:30:49,625 --> 00:30:50,625
NARRATOR:
<i>Maeby felt bad.</i>

873
00:30:50,667 --> 00:30:52,542
<i>He gave you money directly?</i>

874
00:30:52,583 --> 00:30:54,083
If you can believe that.

875
00:30:54,125 --> 00:30:56,041
Anyway, this is your money now,

876
00:30:56,083 --> 00:30:59,417
and if you choose
to do facial reconstruction...

877
00:30:59,458 --> 00:31:01,709
I mean, the nose, right?

878
00:31:03,333 --> 00:31:06,041
<i>But Maeby was more concerned</i>

879
00:31:06,083 --> 00:31:08,375
<i>about losing</i>
<i>yet another income stream.</i>

880
00:31:08,417 --> 00:31:11,250
So he's trying to snake
the bottom bitch from my stable?

881
00:31:11,291 --> 00:31:14,041
<i>And more importantly,</i>
<i>her rep on the street.</i>

882
00:31:14,083 --> 00:31:17,166
<i>And she knew</i>
<i>just who to go to about it.</i>

883
00:31:17,208 --> 00:31:18,667
He stole money from me.

884
00:31:18,709 --> 00:31:20,083
He's a bully, so I want you

885
00:31:20,125 --> 00:31:22,208
to "bad cop" him
for me a little, okay?

886
00:31:22,250 --> 00:31:23,417
So where is this bully?

887
00:31:23,458 --> 00:31:26,083
He's right there.

888
00:31:26,125 --> 00:31:27,250
The little guy
with the cigarette?

889
00:31:27,291 --> 00:31:28,625
No, the ripped black guy
behind him.

890
00:31:28,667 --> 00:31:30,583
-Oh, right.
<i>-Perfecto was nervous...</i>

891
00:31:30,625 --> 00:31:32,625
I just... I just didn't look
up high enough.

892
00:31:32,667 --> 00:31:34,625
<i>...but headed off</i>
<i>to do as told.</i>

893
00:31:34,667 --> 00:31:36,417
-Herbert Love, Herbert Love...
<i>-And later,</i>

894
00:31:36,458 --> 00:31:38,500
<i>after Herbert Love</i>
<i>didn't return,</i>

895
00:31:38,542 --> 00:31:40,834
<i>-Perfecto did.</i>
-Hey, did you do it?

896
00:31:40,875 --> 00:31:41,834
It's taken care of.

897
00:31:41,875 --> 00:31:43,417
-Oh.
-(shouting)

898
00:31:43,458 --> 00:31:45,333
<i>But that's when</i>
<i>the party got out of control.</i>

899
00:31:45,375 --> 00:31:46,667
-(clamoring)
-What's going on?

900
00:31:46,709 --> 00:31:48,250
Guess the blowback has started.

901
00:31:48,291 --> 00:31:49,417
Thank God I'm with
an undercover cop.

902
00:31:49,458 --> 00:31:50,417
Pull out your gun.

903
00:31:50,458 --> 00:31:51,625
I don't have a gun.

904
00:31:51,667 --> 00:31:53,083
What kind of cop
doesn't have a gun?

905
00:31:53,125 --> 00:31:54,583
Okay, I'm not a cop.

906
00:31:54,625 --> 00:31:56,667
But I saw your badge at the bar.

907
00:31:56,709 --> 00:32:00,291
<i>In fact,</i>
<i>it was an anti-bullying badge.</i>

908
00:32:00,333 --> 00:32:02,208
<i>He'd received it</i>
<i>from a police-run</i>

909
00:32:02,250 --> 00:32:04,375
<i>anti-bullying program</i>
<i>at school.</i>

910
00:32:04,417 --> 00:32:05,625
You're never too old
to stand up to a bully.

911
00:32:05,667 --> 00:32:07,625
PERFECTO: I made up
all that stuff

912
00:32:07,667 --> 00:32:09,667
to impress you;
I'm just a senior.

913
00:32:09,709 --> 00:32:11,500
A señor?

914
00:32:11,542 --> 00:32:13,125
I'm 17.

915
00:32:13,166 --> 00:32:14,625
Ha!

916
00:32:14,667 --> 00:32:16,458
You're 17?

917
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:17,583
Yeah.

918
00:32:17,625 --> 00:32:19,458
I'm 23.

919
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:22,000
Oh, that's a relief.

920
00:32:22,041 --> 00:32:23,834
I wasn't supposed
to be driving with you.

921
00:32:23,875 --> 00:32:25,000
But we messed around.

922
00:32:25,041 --> 00:32:27,125
NARRATOR:
<i>Oh, they did more than that.</i>

923
00:32:27,166 --> 00:32:28,417
(horn blows)

924
00:32:28,458 --> 00:32:30,125
Don't worry; nobody saw.

925
00:32:30,166 --> 00:32:32,333
<i>Except Lucille 2.</i>

926
00:32:32,375 --> 00:32:34,458
<i>And that's when Maeby,</i>
<i>who had spent so long</i>

927
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:38,166
<i>lying to others</i>
<i>and even herself,</i>

928
00:32:38,208 --> 00:32:40,750
<i>finally had to admit</i>
<i>she had made a huge mis...</i>

929
00:32:40,792 --> 00:32:42,792
Oh, no, I'm fine.

930
00:32:48,208 --> 00:32:50,208
<i>...Lucille 2 becomes</i>
<i>less of a threat to Maeby.</i>

931
00:32:50,250 --> 00:32:53,417
<i>...is an ongoing investigation,</i>
<i>we are pretty certain</i>

932
00:32:53,458 --> 00:32:56,166
<i>that this is where</i>
<i>Lucille Austero landed.</i>

933
00:32:56,208 --> 00:32:58,417
<i>It is the way she usually falls.</i>

934
00:32:58,458 --> 00:33:00,166
Are you gonna run in her place?

935
00:33:00,208 --> 00:33:02,500
Hey, hey, hey, hey,
let's not bury her yet.

936
00:33:02,542 --> 00:33:04,500
We are all
still holding out hope

937
00:33:04,542 --> 00:33:06,542
that she is, indeed, found.

938
00:33:09,542 --> 00:33:10,750
<i>But a new threat</i>
<i>to Maeby emerges.</i>

939
00:33:10,792 --> 00:33:12,333
Shh. Stop it. What?

940
00:33:12,375 --> 00:33:13,625
Can we at least have
breakup sex?

941
00:33:13,667 --> 00:33:15,333
No, you're 17.

942
00:33:15,375 --> 00:33:16,667
I'm 23-year-old woman.

943
00:33:16,709 --> 00:33:18,500
If anyone found out
that we already had sex,

944
00:33:18,542 --> 00:33:20,542
it would be a major felony.

945
00:33:20,583 --> 00:33:23,500
Congratulations.
You got your first A.

946
00:33:23,542 --> 00:33:26,542
Oh, thank God. This A is finally
gonna get me out of high school.

947
00:33:26,583 --> 00:33:29,458
No, sex offender,
your A is going to jail.

948
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:31,583
You can't arrest me;
you're an algebra teacher.

949
00:33:31,625 --> 00:33:34,208
Donny Richter is
an algebra teacher.

950
00:33:34,250 --> 00:33:35,667
I'm Rocky Richter.

951
00:33:35,709 --> 00:33:38,500
I told you there was an
undercover cop in this school.

952
00:33:38,542 --> 00:33:39,500
(handcuffs clicking)

953
00:33:39,542 --> 00:33:41,375
Oh, God.

954
00:33:41,417 --> 00:33:43,875
I'm gonna have to live
in Sudden Valley.
