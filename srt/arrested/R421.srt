165
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:12,200
I was tinkling! [laughs]

166
00:08:12,283 --> 00:08:13,493
You kept me from mother?

167
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:16,329
You sent her to prison?

168
00:08:17,246 --> 00:08:19,832
And this whole time I thought
about getting back together with you.

169
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:23,920
Well, you're a little late, honey.
I've been dating your father for weeks.

Oh, George.
Yes, thank you for meeting me here.

00:09:04,585 --> 00:09:07,505
Below the charts. Under the charts.
I don't know how to say that.

182
00:09:07,588 --> 00:09:09,382
You have almost no testosterone at all.

183
00:09:09,465 --> 00:09:12,802
I don't know the exact numbers,
but it's somewhere in the baby range.

184
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:15,263
On the plus side, your estrogen levels

185
00:09:15,346 --> 00:09:18,724

in the throes of her menses.

186

May I see my results?

187
00:09:20,101 --> 00:09:21,811
I wish you'd asked me five minutes ago.

188
00:09:21,894 --> 00:09:24,355
I dumped it with a pot pipe
and a bottle of cheetah sedative.

189
00:09:24,438 --> 00:09:26,357
Also, the people at Orange County Imaging

190
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:29,569
said that you were masturbating
in an MRI tube?

191
00:09:30,653 --> 00:09:33,072
-Oh, no.
-But, Doctor, you told me to.

192
00:09:33,155 --> 00:09:38,327
I did no such thing. Oh, no.
No. No, you can't do that.

193
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:42,748
That sounds like something I would say
when I had my thinking cap on. [laughs]

194
00:09:42,832 --> 00:09:44,625
You, sir, are a very funny lady.

195
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:50,047
Well, that's what they always say

We made plans to escape on the boat!

228
00:11:40,324 --> 00:11:42,243
I never made plans with you.

229
00:11:42,326 --> 00:11:46,038
We talked about it on the phone

-Oh...
-What is wrong with you?

This is embarrassing.
Full disclosure. That was Oscar,

who may have been the one
you were talking with.

233
00:11:53,254 --> 00:11:57,007
He's been filling in for me occasionally.

234
00:11:57,091 --> 00:11:59,260
You sent your brother to have sex with me?

235
00:11:59,343 --> 00:12:03,889
No, I sent him to listen to you one time,
and then he found out about the wall

236
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:08,144
and tried to get you talking about it,
and this was his way of shutting you up.

-He told you this?
-No, you told me when I visited.

238

I got in there a couple of times, too.

239
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:17,611
So, tell me about this trip.
That's interesting. Where we going?

240
00:12:17,695 --> 00:12:20,740
I'll tell you where we're going.
We're going to court.

241
00:12:21,532 --> 00:12:25,119
We're getting a real divorce.
You're out of the marriage.

242

So I am fat.

Boy, am I glad you're here. I need money.

244
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:35,713
It's not for what you think,
for a magic show or a bee colony.

245
00:12:35,796 --> 00:12:38,299
It's to pay the builders I hired
to start building the fake wall

-between Mexico and America.
-Shh!

247

What are you crazy?
Lucille 2 is around here.

248
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:45,639
Well, don't worry about Lucille 2,
I'll handle her.

249
00:12:45,723 --> 00:12:47,808
It's just that I need to pay the Chinese.

250
00:12:47,892 --> 00:12:50,394
Wait, wait. You hired Chinese?

251
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:53,731
Well, I figured, who better
than the Chinese to build a wall?

252
00:12:54,315 --> 00:12:56,025
But, no. I couldn't afford them,

253
00:12:56,108 --> 00:12:59,779
so I hired...
They're technically Mongols, I guess.

254
00:12:59,862 --> 00:13:03,073
They're the people that
they built the wall to try to keep out.

255
00:13:03,157 --> 00:13:04,492
How many did you hire?

256
00:13:04,575 --> 00:13:07,745
A horde. That's the minimum.
They don't come in anything less.

257
00:13:07,828 --> 00:13:10,289
So you hired a Mongol horde.

258
00:13:10,372 --> 00:13:11,999
Look, Dad, I just...

259
00:13:12,082 --> 00:13:15,252
If they don't get their money soon,
they're gonna be really mad

260
00:13:15,336 --> 00:13:17,338
and have a major Mongolian beef with us.

261
00:13:17,421 --> 00:13:18,547
They're there.

262
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:20,174
We don't have any money.

263
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:25,221

Lucille!

321
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:24,358
You are not the villain.

322
00:16:26,026 --> 00:16:28,946
[sighs] I'm so tired of being the villain.

323
00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:33,033
Well, those days are over.
What you are is the Invisible Girl.

324
00:16:34,034 --> 00:16:37,454
You make it impossible for people
to see you to protect yourself.

325
00:16:37,538 --> 00:16:40,624
[narrator] <i> And somehow, in that moment,</i>
<i>something changed for her.</i>

326
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:42,251
I do do that.

327
00:16:42,334 --> 00:16:44,545
And in this way, you launch sneak attacks,

328
00:16:44,628 --> 00:16:46,672
and you create a force field
to keep people away.

329
00:16:46,755 --> 00:16:50,551
Right! I'm not a villain.
I'm the Invisible Girl!

330
00:16:50,634 --> 00:16:52,136
Yes, that's what I'm saying!

331
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:56,306
Oh, you know, it's funny...
I never would have come to this

332
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:58,892
if it hadn't been for you
and Lucille 2's rehab,

333
00:16:58,976 --> 00:17:02,104
I need to pay her back
for everything she's done to me.

334

I'm going back to rehab.

335
00:17:05,816 --> 00:17:08,569
I just have to make one quick stop first.

336
00:17:09,403 --> 00:17:10,863
I don't think we have time.

337
00:17:11,447 --> 00:17:12,698

343
00:17:29,757 --> 00:17:32,593
