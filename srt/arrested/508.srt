gay magician into the other,

then you come out of the
opposite closets, okay?

7
00:00:25,125 --> 00:00:29,041
Except now, he's straight
and you're gay.

8
00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:32,625
You could go back and forth
the whole parade.

10
00:00:35,666 --> 00:00:37,833
-I love it.
-Yeah. (chuckles)

11
00:00:37,916 --> 00:00:41,958
But the big question is:
will Tony? I mean, sometimes,

12
00:00:42,041 --> 00:00:44,708
I'm really into something,
and he hates me.

13
00:00:44,791 --> 00:00:46,958

only one way to know.

Yeah. Okay.

00:00:59,833 --> 00:01:01,208
Okay.

Okay. Sure.

-He's in.
-ALL: Yeah!

You said the words.

Did I exaggerate about her?

39

She really is just like the
mother in<i> Two and a Half Men.</i>

40
00:02:10,333 --> 00:02:11,708
No, you did not.

41
00:02:11,791 --> 00:02:13,750
Start watching that show?
Yes, I did, Mother.

42
00:02:13,833 --> 00:02:15,416
And you lied to me.

43
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:18,500
There's no scary half-man
that I couldn't handle.

44
00:02:18,583 --> 00:02:20,666
I don't approve of that show.

45
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:22,041
Well, there's a lot
of stuff I've done

46
00:02:22,125 --> 00:02:23,708
in this prison that you
might not approve of.

47
00:02:23,791 --> 00:02:25,250
I touched a mouse.

48
00:02:25,333 --> 00:02:29,958
I read an illustrated Qur'an
for kids, and at recess once,

49
00:02:30,041 --> 00:02:31,833
I sat in "Blacks only."

50
00:02:31,916 --> 00:02:33,083
Yard.

51
00:02:33,166 --> 00:02:34,750
Oh, I keep doing that.

52
00:02:34,833 --> 00:02:39,166
But maybe what you really

00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:42,833
If you must know the truth,
I'm not thrilled with you.

-Okay.
-The last time I saw you,

55
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:47,625
you told me
you didn't need me anymore.

Okay-- So I'm to believe

57
00:02:49,166 --> 00:02:52,291
that's what you're upset about?
(laughs)

58
00:02:52,375 --> 00:02:53,708
Not that you think
I'm a murderer?

59
00:02:53,791 --> 00:02:55,333
Or that I touched a mouse?

60
00:02:55,416 --> 00:02:57,416
I happen to know for a fact

61
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:59,166
-you're not a murderer.
-What?

62
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:01,458
Lucille 2's fine,

63
00:03:01,541 --> 00:03:04,333
but she can't
come back right now.

64
00:03:04,416 --> 00:03:05,750
You know where she is?

65
00:03:05,833 --> 00:03:07,125
-I know who she's with,
-(Buster gasps)

66
00:03:07,208 --> 00:03:09,750
and that's all I can say.

67
00:03:09,833 --> 00:03:12,083
Why don't you say it to someone
to get me out of here?

68
00:03:12,166 --> 00:03:13,916
I can't do that right now.

69
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,666
You'll just have to
sit tight and trust me

70
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:17,291
for a little while longer.

71
00:03:17,375 --> 00:03:19,291
(chuckles)
So it's like that again.

72
00:03:19,375 --> 00:03:20,791
History repeats.

73
00:03:20,875 --> 00:03:22,916
You remember that?

74
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,375
I remember you paying me off

75
00:03:24,458 --> 00:03:27,291
by letting me go
to the Fourth of July parade,

76
00:03:27,375 --> 00:03:29,750
but I'm a man now.

77
00:03:29,833 --> 00:03:32,041
Paying me off
isn't gonna be that easy.

78
00:03:32,125 --> 00:03:34,750
You'll need the warden's
permission, and then

79
00:03:34,833 --> 00:03:37,291
you'll have to sponsor me for
my furlough, and they probably

80
00:03:37,375 --> 00:03:38,958
won't let me on the float again,
but that's just...

81
00:03:39,041 --> 00:03:41,000
Oh, God, it's still
the parade, isn't it?

82
00:03:41,083 --> 00:03:42,125
We're still talking about...

83
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:44,041
Oh, we're talking about it!

84
00:03:44,125 --> 00:03:45,791
Buster, please.

85
00:03:45,875 --> 00:03:47,291
The parade's in two days.

86
00:03:47,375 --> 00:03:48,916
The whole city will be there.

87
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,833
The last thing
this family needs right now

88
00:03:51,916 --> 00:03:55,375
is a Bluth in a chain gang,
picking up trash.

89
00:03:55,458 --> 00:03:58,166
Well, it's either that,
or I'm gonna start spewing it.

90
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:00,416
And your job's not gonna
be easy since,

91
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:03,208
of course, I got dinged because
I screamed, "Turn it off!"

92
00:04:03,291 --> 00:04:05,166
after they showed the half-man.

93
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:06,958
It's like they need another
reason to call me...

94
00:04:07,041 --> 00:04:08,333
-Half-man?
-...Jon Cryer.

95
00:04:08,416 --> 00:04:09,250
Oh.

So, you're not gonna
believe this...

105
00:04:27,166 --> 00:04:28,500
What are you doing?

106
00:04:28,583 --> 00:04:30,083
I'm doing another scrub and run.

107
00:04:30,166 --> 00:04:31,833
My sex date is tonight,

108
00:04:31,916 --> 00:04:33,375
and there's no
other way out of it.

109
00:04:33,458 --> 00:04:35,041
And honestly,
if I wanted a hairless lover,

110
00:04:35,125 --> 00:04:37,083
I'd probably go underage rather
than overage, you know?

111
00:04:37,166 --> 00:04:39,583
-What's that? -No, I mean, not
that I would do it on purpose.

112
00:04:39,666 --> 00:04:41,416
I'm just saying if I had a gun
to somebody's head.

113

-If you had a...
-What do you want me to do?

114
00:04:43,625 --> 00:04:46,291
You want me to shoot a kid?
What kind of monster are you?

115
00:04:46,375 --> 00:04:48,166
I'm not sure how I became
the monster there,

116
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:50,208
but what happened to your plan
to make Annette forgetful?

117
00:04:50,291 --> 00:04:53,291
Like, she can't keep track of
things, to get out of the date?

118
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:55,541
Well, it ended up having
the opposite effect.

119
00:04:55,625 --> 00:04:57,916
NARRATOR:<i> Because when Maeby</i>

00:05:03,666 --> 00:05:04,958
Oh, what a relief.

122
00:05:05,041 --> 00:05:07,250

<i> -They weren't cops. </i>
-This is wonderful.

129

I've always wanted
to be a Keystone Cop.

130
00:05:19,166 --> 00:05:21,666
It would be my honor to wear
this handlebar mustache

-in the 2nd of July parade.
-LOU: That's right.

It's your first parade
not playing the jailbird.

133
00:05:25,708 --> 00:05:26,666
So you should know,

134
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:28,416
those can be tricky to stick on.

135
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,750
Hey. I think I know
what I'm doing.

136
00:05:30,833 --> 00:05:32,416

Long coats. He's not
gonna let her go,

139
00:05:38,416 --> 00:05:39,750
which means I have to.

140
00:05:39,833 --> 00:05:42,791
Good-bye, Annette.

141
00:05:42,875 --> 00:05:45,750
Good-bye to our teeth that
make it look like I'm smiling

142
00:05:45,833 --> 00:05:47,208
so I don't have to.

143
00:05:47,291 --> 00:05:49,666
And you,
I'll miss you most of all,

144
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:52,750
neighbor's pain medication.

145
00:05:52,833 --> 00:05:55,208
(voice breaking):
I never even got the chance...

146
00:05:55,291 --> 00:05:58,083
Nah, I'll just take you with me.

147
00:05:58,166 --> 00:06:00,541
So, now that you found out
your dad's sneaking around

148
00:06:00,625 --> 00:06:03,791
with your girlfriend, looks like
you need a roommate, too, huh?

149
00:06:03,875 --> 00:06:05,416
No, that's what I came
to talk to you about.

150
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,291
He wasn't going
to see Rebel in Mexico.

151
00:06:07,375 --> 00:06:09,833
The whole thing was just
a crazy, paranoid idea.

152
00:06:09,916 --> 00:06:11,416
Who knows where we get
these ideas from, right?

153
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:14,208
Well, you. I got that from you.
It's always from you.

154
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:16,625
Oh, yeah, I was gonna say
that sounded like one of mine.

155
00:06:16,708 --> 00:06:18,791
Yeah, so I was going down there
to catch my father in this lie,

156
00:06:18,875 --> 00:06:20,416
and it turns out that I was
the one caught in a lie,

157
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:23,041
because there's a picture
of the stair car in Mexico.

00:06:47,166 --> 00:06:49,375
MICHAEL: No, no, no. You'd be
out of business, and by the way,

171
00:06:49,458 --> 00:06:50,833
Barry, you had
the best lie of all,

172
00:06:50,916 --> 00:06:52,333
saying that they had a picture

173
00:06:52,416 --> 00:06:54,958
of-of Lucille 2 and Oscar
in the stair car.

174
00:06:55,041 --> 00:07:00,041
That is not a lie. You said,
"Keep it as real as possible."

175
00:07:00,125 --> 00:07:02,333
Prismo, texting mode.

176
00:07:02,416 --> 00:07:04,333
AUTOMATED VOICE:
<i> Self-drive on.</i>

177
00:07:04,416 --> 00:07:06,083
MICHAEL: This was real?
If they've got this,

178
00:07:06,166 --> 00:07:08,333
there's no reason for them
to hold Buster and they know it.

179
00:07:08,416 --> 00:07:10,500
-Did you know about this, Dad?
-GEORGE SR.: Are you kidding?

180
00:07:10,583 --> 00:07:12,125
Thanks to your mother,
I can't even feel

181
00:07:12,208 --> 00:07:15,916
-your son on my lap.
-Can I see that, Dad?

182
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,708
MAEBY:<i> Ugh, so Lucille 2</i>
<i> is alive? Great.</i>

183
00:07:18,791 --> 00:07:20,875
Another reason I got to get
the hell out of here.

184
00:07:20,958 --> 00:07:22,250
No, it wasn't her, it was us.

185
00:07:22,333 --> 00:07:24,125
From when we went to Mexico
with Steve Holt.

186
00:07:24,208 --> 00:07:25,958
Don't you remember
how we got there?

187
00:07:26,041 --> 00:07:27,958
NARRATOR:
<i> It was just after Cinco</i>

188
00:07:28,041 --> 00:07:29,708
<i> when Maeby suggested</i>
<i> fleeing the country.</i>

189
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:31,500
Screw it.
No rules, anything goes.

190
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:34,375
-Just the cousins.
-Hey, why don't we take that?

191
00:07:36,583 --> 00:07:39,041
STEVE:
<i> Primos! </i>(laughs)

192
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:40,166
So anyway, now my dad
and everyone else

193
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:41,375
thinks that they have proof

194
00:07:41,458 --> 00:07:42,583
that's gonna exonerate Buster

195
00:07:42,666 --> 00:07:43,666
that I know isn't true.

196
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:45,166
And I'm not sure
whether I should...

197
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:46,791
Lie to him.

198
00:07:46,875 --> 00:07:49,041
What do you think?

199
00:07:49,125 --> 00:07:51,833
Oh, okay. You just told me.
Really?

200
00:07:51,916 --> 00:07:53,041
Even though we just left

201
00:07:53,125 --> 00:07:54,125
the stair car there
when it broke down?

202
00:07:54,208 --> 00:07:55,875
I mean, what if they find it?

203
00:07:55,958 --> 00:07:57,833
I'm sure somebody got it working
and it's long gone.

204
00:07:57,916 --> 00:08:01,041
And it's not like you're
actually lying to your dad.

205
00:08:01,125 --> 00:08:03,833
You're just letting him believe
something that isn't true.

206
00:08:03,916 --> 00:08:06,750
You know? Like how people
think the world's melting

207
00:08:06,833 --> 00:08:08,250
because people drive cars,

208
00:08:08,333 --> 00:08:10,750
or that Hillary should
continue to roam free.

209
00:08:10,833 --> 00:08:12,291
NARRATOR:
<i> And Maeby realized</i>

210
00:08:12,375 --> 00:08:14,583
<i> she had something else</i>
<i> to say good-bye to.</i>

211
00:08:14,666 --> 00:08:17,791
Good-bye,<i> Fox &amp; Friends.</i>

212
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:21,250
NARRATOR:<i> Meanwhile, Lucille</i>
<i> was growing concerned</i>

213
00:08:21,333 --> 00:08:22,500
<i> that her daughter Lindsay</i>

214
00:08:22,583 --> 00:08:24,125
<i> wouldn't be back in time</i>
<i> for the parade.</i>

215
00:08:24,208 --> 00:08:25,625
REPORTER:<i> Sally, Sally,</i>
<i> where are you headed?</i>

216
00:08:25,708 --> 00:08:28,333
<i> I think the more important</i>
<i> question here is:</i>

217
00:08:28,416 --> 00:08:30,833
<i> where is my opponent,</i>
<i> Lindsay Bluth?</i>

218
00:08:30,916 --> 00:08:33,625
<i> Maybe she's hiding behind</i>
<i> this wall she wants to build.</i>

219
00:08:33,708 --> 00:08:35,666
<i> If she does indeed</i>
<i> show up at the parade,</i>

220
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:40,000
<i> I will be very surprised,</i>
<i> though I may not look it.</i>

221
00:08:40,083 --> 00:08:41,791
<i> -No further questions.</i>
-(knocking on door)

222
00:08:41,875 --> 00:08:43,666
-Hey, hey.
-(sighs)

223
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:45,958
Oh, George,
I've been worried sick.

224
00:08:46,041 --> 00:08:50,041
About Buster being stuck
in-in that jail.

225
00:08:50,125 --> 00:08:54,041
They are making him a patsy,
parading him around,

226
00:08:54,125 --> 00:08:56,791
frightening the masses
before the Fourth of July.

227
00:08:56,875 --> 00:08:58,583
It's on the second this year.

228
00:08:58,666 --> 00:09:02,958
And being in the parade was
his idea, like it was in 1982.

229
00:09:03,041 --> 00:09:05,250
We're trying to get
Lindsay elected,

230
00:09:05,333 --> 00:09:06,833
and Buster wants everyone
in the world

231
00:09:06,916 --> 00:09:09,208
to see him in
an orange jumpsuit.

232
00:09:09,291 --> 00:09:12,000
-So he'll be out in public?
-I don't want to tell you

233
00:09:12,083 --> 00:09:15,000
what I had to give the warden
to make that happen.

234
00:09:15,083 --> 00:09:16,250
I don't want to hear it.

235
00:09:16,333 --> 00:09:18,083
Meanwhile, we still
don't have a Lindsay,

236
00:09:18,166 --> 00:09:20,041
and Sally is calling us
out about it.

237
00:09:20,125 --> 00:09:22,916
We've got this elaborate float
to help distract from the fact

238
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,708
that there's
no stair car this year,

239
00:09:24,791 --> 00:09:26,500
-and nobody to put on it.
-(phone buzzing)

240
00:09:26,583 --> 00:09:29,083
-Ugh, God.<i> -Fortunately,</i>
<i> Tobias was finally calling.</i>

241
00:09:29,166 --> 00:09:30,541
Oh, thank God, it's Tobias.

242
00:09:32,833 --> 00:09:34,416
You better have found
my daughter.

243
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,583
Sally is now in the race,
and she's pointing out

244
00:09:36,666 --> 00:09:38,708
that no one has seen
Lindsay in a week.

245
00:09:38,791 --> 00:09:40,750
Yes. I didn't want
to get your hopes up,

246
00:09:40,833 --> 00:09:42,875
<i> but I'm in Mexico</i>
<i> and I have found Lindsay...</i>

247
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:44,875
-Oh, thank God. 
<i> -...to be very stubborn.</i>

248
00:09:44,958 --> 00:09:46,125
<i> Oh, damn it,</i>

249
00:09:46,208 --> 00:09:48,250
I just did exactly
what I said I wouldn't do.

250
00:09:48,333 --> 00:09:49,791
Anyway, I'm at Ma Bark's,

251
00:09:49,875 --> 00:09:52,583
and she tells me Lindsay
should be back this afternoon,

252
00:09:52,666 --> 00:09:54,958
before I'm out of my
postal plumage. Of course,

253
00:09:55,041 --> 00:09:56,083
when she does come back,

254
00:09:56,166 --> 00:09:58,000
I'll still need to get her
into the car.

255
00:09:58,083 --> 00:09:59,625
Well, say whatever you need to.

256
00:09:59,708 --> 00:10:01,416
<i> Yes. I was thinking</i>
<i> I would just say,</i>

257
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,708
"Your mother is so sorry
she upset you."

258
00:10:03,791 --> 00:10:05,166
Out of the question.

259
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:08,208
(sighs) Yes. It felt
a little out of character.

260
00:10:08,291 --> 00:10:10,250
<i> How about I just</i>
<i> make it about me?</i>

261
00:10:10,333 --> 00:10:12,541
"It's incredibly important
to me and my life..."

262
00:10:12,625 --> 00:10:15,041
Where is this going?

263
00:10:15,125 --> 00:10:16,500
"...and if you do this for me,

264
00:10:16,583 --> 00:10:18,250
"I'm sure Lucille
will make me permanent member

265
00:10:18,333 --> 00:10:19,708
of the Bluth family."

266
00:10:19,791 --> 00:10:21,875
That way, you're not
lying to Lindsay...

267
00:10:21,958 --> 00:10:25,375
You are. Well, that sounds
like the best

268
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:28,333
of our diplomatic options,

269
00:10:28,416 --> 00:10:30,250
but you're in Mexico,
for God's sake.

270
00:10:30,333 --> 00:10:33,541
Please tell me you prepared
a few "against her wills."

271
00:10:33,625 --> 00:10:36,750
(chuckles) Oh, my gosh.
I do miss that wit, Mother.

272
00:10:36,833 --> 00:10:39,166
It's Mrs. Bluth.
I wasn't joking.

273
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:41,250
And you're right,
we need her standing,

274
00:10:41,333 --> 00:10:44,125
<i> and dressed and ready</i>
<i> for the parade.</i>

275
00:10:44,208 --> 00:10:47,416
On it. In the meantime, wow,
what a trip! (laughs)

276
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:49,166
Murphybrown saw an armadillo,

277
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:51,833
men held us up at gunpoint,
and I got to dress up

278
00:10:51,916 --> 00:10:53,333
<i> -as an os...</i>

279
00:10:53,416 --> 00:10:55,250
NARRATOR:<i> It would be five</i>

280
00:10:55,333 --> 00:10:57,625
<i> she was no longer on the phone.</i>

281
00:10:57,708 --> 00:11:00,708
<i> And, as Tobias awaited</i>
<i> bringing Lindsay home,</i>

282
00:11:00,791 --> 00:11:03,250
<i> Maeby was reluctantly</i>

283
00:11:03,333 --> 00:11:05,500
You're Annette's granddaughter,

284
00:11:05,583 --> 00:11:07,791
Yeah, I am.
(chuckles)

285
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:09,416
I'm getting out of here.

286
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:10,875
Saying good-bye to her.

287
00:11:10,958 --> 00:11:12,500
Well, she's in good hands.

288
00:11:12,583 --> 00:11:15,166
Stan would do anything
for your grandmother.

289
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:18,416
If that woman told him
to jump off a bridge, he would.

290
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:21,208
He would, wouldn't he?

291

Nah, I love this place.

294
00:11:33,166 --> 00:11:34,833
I'll just tell him it's over,
and kick him out.

295
00:11:37,708 --> 00:11:39,666
NARRATOR:
<i> It was the 2nd of July,</i>

296
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:41,291
<i> and the Funkes</i>

298

Ugh. This thing
does not breathe.

300
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:51,541
I'll tell you who doesn't bitch
like that, your son.

301
00:11:51,625 --> 00:11:53,458
I'll give you 500 bucks cash

302

My son is not for sale.

Thanks, Dad.

MA BARK: Then shower's off.
There's your wife.

310
00:12:26,208 --> 00:12:27,375
Now you can both go.

311
00:12:27,458 --> 00:12:29,416
Lindsay?

312
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:33,458
-Tobias?
-DeBrie?

313
00:12:33,541 --> 00:12:36,916
No, you were right
the first time. Uh...

314
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,666
(whispering): I've been
pretending to be Lindsay

315
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:41,541
the past few months, on account
of Marky's face blind.

316
00:12:41,625 --> 00:12:43,416
But Marky's buying it.

317
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:45,458
You should hear him: "Oh,
Lindsay, you've let yourself go.

318
00:12:45,541 --> 00:12:48,666
Oh, Lindsay,
why'd you stop showering?"

319
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:50,666
You're missing
some back teeth, there.

320
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:52,708
Yeah. Just like that.

321
00:12:52,791 --> 00:12:54,708
But I don't think
I can be Lindsay anymore.

322
00:12:54,791 --> 00:12:56,250
They're so critical.

323
00:12:56,333 --> 00:12:59,166
And...
I fall apart at criticism.

324
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:02,583
And Marky doesn't see me
for who I really am.

325
00:13:02,666 --> 00:13:04,166
I see you for who you are.

326
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:06,250
DeBrie Bardeaux.

327
00:13:06,333 --> 00:13:08,125
A first-class Lindsay Bluth
impersonator.

328
00:13:08,208 --> 00:13:10,208
Now, let's go to Newport Beach,
and you can be Lindsay there.

329

-Oh, I can't go back to Newport,
-(engine starts)

330
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:14,916
'cause that's where Marky's
headed right now,

parade with a paint bomb.

<i> for the 2nd of July parade</i>

336
00:13:27,666 --> 00:13:29,583
<i> were underway.</i>

337
00:13:29,666 --> 00:13:31,500
We're 20 minutes from float-off.

338
00:13:31,583 --> 00:13:32,750
Ugh, but at least
nobody's noticed

339
00:13:32,833 --> 00:13:34,750
that the stair car's not here.

340
00:13:34,833 --> 00:13:37,500
<i> And that's when Sally</i>
<i> arrived in a float</i>

341
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:39,125
<i> that would make sure</i>
<i> they did notice.</i>

342
00:13:39,208 --> 00:13:41,125
Oh, hello.

343
00:13:41,208 --> 00:13:42,875
What do you think
of the new stair car?

344
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:44,666
I had to make one,
because yours disappeared.

345
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:46,791
Sally Sitwell.

346
00:13:46,875 --> 00:13:48,875
Well, you're no stranger
to stuffing tissue places

347
00:13:48,958 --> 00:13:50,291
when you don't have the goods.

348
00:13:50,375 --> 00:13:52,208
Well, what we don't have
is the candidate

349
00:13:52,291 --> 00:13:54,208
that would've been
Lindsay's opponent.

350
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:55,916
But we made one,
and put her up top.

351
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,208
Although, she's not
as hollow as your candidate.

352
00:13:59,291 --> 00:14:00,583
Uh, where is she?

353
00:14:00,666 --> 00:14:02,041
Uh, she went off somewhere
to pretty herself up

354
00:14:02,125 --> 00:14:03,166
for the parade.

355
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:05,500
Aren't you in it, too?

356
00:14:05,583 --> 00:14:06,750
Ticktock.

357
00:14:06,833 --> 00:14:08,333
The sun is nobody's friend.

358
00:14:08,416 --> 00:14:12,500
Speaking of which, where is that
friendless son of yours,

359
00:14:12,583 --> 00:14:13,875
Buster?

360
00:14:13,958 --> 00:14:15,583
Is it true he's in prison?

361
00:14:15,666 --> 00:14:18,541
Well, yes,
in the Keystone Cops skit

362
00:14:18,625 --> 00:14:20,500
in your father's old role.

363
00:14:20,583 --> 00:14:23,333
<i> Something Buster</i>
<i> had only discovered</i>

364
00:14:23,416 --> 00:14:24,750
<i> -moments earlier. </i>-Mr. Bluth,
you're not on cleaning detail.

365
00:14:24,833 --> 00:14:26,333
What?

366
00:14:26,416 --> 00:14:30,041
Is this because I accidentally
choked Ron Howard?

367
00:14:30,125 --> 00:14:31,750
Because they already
made me pay for that.

368
00:14:31,833 --> 00:14:32,916
They chopped your hand off?

369
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,458
No, they just downgraded me
to a manual.

370
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:38,291
Listen,
I don't mean to namedrop,

371
00:14:38,375 --> 00:14:40,791
but Mother was supposed to have
already arranged for me

372
00:14:40,875 --> 00:14:42,083
to follow the parade.

373
00:14:42,166 --> 00:14:43,333
Sorry.

374
00:14:43,416 --> 00:14:44,750
I got a note
from the warden himself.

375
00:14:44,833 --> 00:14:47,833
You're in a cage
on a Keystone Cop float.

376
00:14:47,916 --> 00:14:49,875
What?

377
00:14:49,958 --> 00:14:51,375
You mean I'm in the parade?
(gasps)

378
00:14:51,458 --> 00:14:54,375
Are there dressing rooms
for the talent?

379
00:14:54,458 --> 00:14:55,958
Oh, well, at least
Buster's being held.

380
00:14:56,041 --> 00:14:58,750
Which is more
than he had as a child.

381
00:14:58,833 --> 00:15:00,958
NARRATOR:<i> Sally wasn't</i>
<i> that sweet after all.</i>

382
00:15:01,041 --> 00:15:04,083
When this is all over,
let's get coffee.

383
00:15:05,625 --> 00:15:06,875
(inhales)

384
00:15:06,958 --> 00:15:09,250
<i> And Tobias made sure his son</i>
<i> was occupied</i>

385
00:15:09,333 --> 00:15:11,291
<i> while DeBrie prepared</i>
<i> for her role as Lindsay.</i>

386
00:15:11,375 --> 00:15:12,375
TOBIAS:
I will leave you here

387
00:15:12,458 --> 00:15:14,166
and what could be more exciting

388
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:15,625
than to be backstage

389
00:15:15,708 --> 00:15:19,041
♪ At a parade? ♪

390
00:15:19,125 --> 00:15:21,583
♪ ...ade. ♪

391
00:15:21,666 --> 00:15:25,000
♪ Being watching the parade. ♪

392
00:15:25,083 --> 00:15:26,666
No. With the curb huggers? No.

393
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:29,541
I meant, for one whose dream
it is to be a clown.

394
00:15:29,625 --> 00:15:31,458
Oh, yeah, 'cause he'd be, like,

395
00:15:31,541 --> 00:15:35,250
"This is the one place where I'm
not embarrassed of my dream."

396
00:15:35,333 --> 00:15:38,750
Hey, no. Never apologize
for your dream.

397
00:15:38,833 --> 00:15:41,083
No. I was-I was
making fun of the guy.

398
00:15:41,166 --> 00:15:42,500
What guy?

399
00:15:42,583 --> 00:15:44,875
Whose dream--
whose dream it is.

400
00:15:44,958 --> 00:15:46,333
It's your dream.

401
00:15:46,416 --> 00:15:47,750
We just talked about dreams,

402
00:15:47,833 --> 00:15:50,541
and you said you could unicycle
and juggle.

403
00:15:50,625 --> 00:15:53,125
Oh! That's because my uncle,

404
00:15:53,208 --> 00:15:55,541
he taught me that stuff,
when he used to come over

405
00:15:55,625 --> 00:15:57,375
to cheer me up on Father's Day.

406
00:15:57,458 --> 00:15:59,625
Robbie knows how to juggle?

407
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:01,125
Who's Robbie?

408
00:16:01,208 --> 00:16:03,666
(laughing):
Oh. Yes, of course.

409
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:04,916
You wouldn't know my brother.

410
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,750
Are you one
of our parade clowns?

411
00:16:07,833 --> 00:16:09,750
Me? No, I'm too shy.

412
00:16:09,833 --> 00:16:12,083
No-- yes, yes, he...
yes, he is. Yes.

413
00:16:12,166 --> 00:16:14,791
T-This is, uh, Relucto,
the apprehensive clown.

414
00:16:14,875 --> 00:16:16,416
No, I'm not, where do you...

415
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:17,916
There's the catchphrase.

416
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,083
Let's get you into a chair.

417
00:16:19,166 --> 00:16:21,541
Well, I-I bet right now,

418
00:16:21,625 --> 00:16:23,791
there's a very, very jealous fan
out there who would-who would

419
00:16:23,875 --> 00:16:27,375
give anything to-to trade places
with you and get up on that...

420
00:16:27,458 --> 00:16:29,208
No, I can't,
because I have to be her husband

421
00:16:29,291 --> 00:16:31,000
in that stupid Lindsay float.

422
00:16:31,083 --> 00:16:33,500
Come on, let's go. Let's go.

423
00:16:33,583 --> 00:16:35,500
<i> Meanwhile, Gob was</i>
<i> second-guessing his float,</i>

424
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:38,041
<i> as he waited for Tony Wonder,</i>
<i> who had yet to show up.</i>

425
00:16:38,125 --> 00:16:39,875
-Aw, damn it!
-Hey, Gob, have you seen Mom?

426
00:16:39,958 --> 00:16:42,291
No. Um, hey, how would you
like to help me

427
00:16:42,375 --> 00:16:44,500
in a double-closet
sexuality switch

428
00:16:44,583 --> 00:16:45,958
two-hander float illusion,

429
00:16:46,041 --> 00:16:48,541
no credit, no money?
Oh, and you turn gay.

430
00:16:48,625 --> 00:16:50,833
-I'll pass. -Yeah, that's what
I thought of you.

431
00:16:50,916 --> 00:16:52,291
Look, we're gonna pull out
of here in five minutes,

432
00:16:52,375 --> 00:16:53,500
and Tony's not here;
what if he doesn't show?

433
00:16:53,583 --> 00:16:54,916
Gob, you'll be fine.

434
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,083
Do you remember
high school commencement,

435
00:16:56,166 --> 00:16:57,458
when they asked you
to represent all the kids

436
00:16:57,541 --> 00:16:59,458
that were being left back,
and then you had

437
00:16:59,541 --> 00:17:00,500
to quickly find
a replacement for Buster

438
00:17:00,583 --> 00:17:02,375
who was too afraid
to be sawed in half?

439
00:17:02,458 --> 00:17:03,666
So you're saying nothing's worse

440
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:05,416
than the sound
of the dog screaming?

441
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:07,333
No, I just meant you're not
a very good magician.

442
00:17:07,416 --> 00:17:11,125
<i> And that's when Gob noticed</i>
<i> a less discerning brother,</i>

443
00:17:11,208 --> 00:17:14,458
<i> who also happened to be his</i>
<i> former magician's assistant.</i>

444
00:17:14,541 --> 00:17:15,833
GOB:
Hey.

445
00:17:15,916 --> 00:17:18,750
-Hey.
-Oh.

446
00:17:18,833 --> 00:17:20,833
-Sup. Listen,
I'm glad you're here. -Sup...

447
00:17:20,916 --> 00:17:22,333
I might need you to fill in
for Tony Wonder

448
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:23,958
-in my illusion.
-Mm.

449
00:17:24,041 --> 00:17:25,458
It's gonna involve you
being put into a small,

450
00:17:25,541 --> 00:17:27,291
confined space,
and you come out gay.

451
00:17:27,375 --> 00:17:30,875
If that's a swipe about me being
in prison, I understand it.

452
00:17:30,958 --> 00:17:32,500
Oh, right, you're in prison.

453
00:17:32,583 --> 00:17:33,750
What are you doing here?

454
00:17:33,833 --> 00:17:35,083
Well, Mom arranged it.

455
00:17:35,166 --> 00:17:36,958
Although, it is nice
to be able to see family again,

456
00:17:37,041 --> 00:17:38,750
because, not to be rude,

457
00:17:38,833 --> 00:17:40,500
-but you didn't visit me in...
-Oh, there's a dog.

458
00:17:40,583 --> 00:17:42,958
<i> And Tobias and a nervous DeBrie</i>

459
00:17:43,041 --> 00:17:45,000
<i> approached Lucille</i>
<i> to pitch their deception.</i>

460
00:17:45,083 --> 00:17:48,000
Tobias, and if it isn't...
what is it again?

461
00:17:48,083 --> 00:17:49,833
-LeTrasha?
-Hello, again.

462
00:17:49,916 --> 00:17:53,666
Those last few teeth aren't
going without a fight, are they?

463
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:55,958
-Mm, thank you.
-So where's Lindsay?

464
00:17:56,041 --> 00:17:58,166
-You said you had Lindsay.
-TOBIAS: Yes.

465
00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:00,541
But it turned out to be the
professional actress DeBrie.

466
00:18:00,625 --> 00:18:03,291
The only acting this one's
good at is feigning interest

467
00:18:03,375 --> 00:18:05,208
in her drug dealer's hobbies.

468
00:18:05,291 --> 00:18:08,208
You do see a lot of aquariums.

469
00:18:08,291 --> 00:18:11,208
But she was coming off
a three-month run as Lindsay

470
00:18:11,291 --> 00:18:15,250
in front of a sold-out audience
of one face blind man.

471
00:18:15,333 --> 00:18:19,041
The point is, if she can fool
him, why not have her violate

472
00:18:19,125 --> 00:18:20,916
federal election guidelines
by fooling

473
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,875
the entire electorate
as the next representative

474
00:18:23,958 --> 00:18:27,708
of the great 48th congressional
district of Californ-i-ay?

475
00:18:27,791 --> 00:18:30,500
Upon a float where, unless
she gives a perfect performance,

476
00:18:30,583 --> 00:18:32,916
she goes to jail for fraud.

477
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,750
Fine. You've left me no choice.

478
00:18:34,833 --> 00:18:37,000
Maybe if you turn away
from the bleachers

479
00:18:37,083 --> 00:18:39,583
and cover your face
with your hand...

480
00:18:39,666 --> 00:18:42,791
I'm sure that's not the first
time you've been told that.

481
00:18:42,875 --> 00:18:44,375
Oh, God, no.

482
00:18:44,458 --> 00:18:45,791
I can't do this. T-This is...

483
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:47,041
-TOBIAS: No, no, no.
-...why I gave this up.

484
00:18:47,125 --> 00:18:48,416
-DeBRIE: Shy.
-No. No, you can.

485
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:49,833
-You can do this.
-No.

486
00:18:49,916 --> 00:18:51,625
-No, no, no. Shy.
-You can't be this critical.

487
00:18:51,708 --> 00:18:53,250
Not too shy, not shy.
No-- happy, good.

488
00:18:53,333 --> 00:18:55,041
(announcer
speaking indistinctly)

489
00:18:55,125 --> 00:18:57,375
Good, happy, not sad.
Don't worry, Lucille.

490
00:18:57,458 --> 00:18:58,833
I've got this covered.

491
00:18:58,916 --> 00:19:00,208
I-- no, no, no. Shy.

492
00:19:00,291 --> 00:19:02,375
-Sad, shy. Sad...
-Just get her up there!

493
00:19:02,458 --> 00:19:04,416
<i> And so, the parade</i>
<i> finally began.</i>

494
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:06,208
<i> Although, "finally" might</i>
<i> not be the right word,</i>

495
00:19:06,291 --> 00:19:10,083
<i> because it was still two days</i>
<i> before the Fourth of July,</i>

496
00:19:10,166 --> 00:19:13,958
<i> and one day before the big</i>
<i> fireworks show on the 3rd.</i>

497
00:19:14,041 --> 00:19:17,500
Welcome to the third annual 2nd
of July Fourth of July parade.

498
00:19:17,583 --> 00:19:19,791
To start the festivities,
please welcome

499
00:19:19,875 --> 00:19:21,666
the Milford Academy
marching band,

500
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:23,000
known throughout the state

501
00:19:23,083 --> 00:19:25,750
as California's
quietest marching band.

502
00:19:25,833 --> 00:19:28,666
Let's all be perfectly still

Michael.

508
00:19:52,833 --> 00:19:55,708
Please tell me you're back,
no one new has been arrested

509
00:19:55,791 --> 00:19:58,375
and that your father is on
the way, but first, a kiss.

510

-Hmm.
-There are cameras everywhere.

511
00:20:01,708 --> 00:20:04,041
Well, that... something
you ought to have thought of

512
00:20:04,125 --> 00:20:08,083
with regard to Lucille 2
and Oscar in Mexico.

513
00:20:08,166 --> 00:20:09,750
LUCILLE: I can't believe they
were so stupid as to flee town

514
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:12,416
-in the stair car.
-Mm-hmm. Mom?

515
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:15,416
Come on, you knew
that Lucille 2 was with Oscar,

516
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:17,125
and you let your son sit
in prison

517
00:20:17,208 --> 00:20:18,833
instead of telling anyone.

518
00:20:18,916 --> 00:20:21,166
Knew? Michael, I can't...

519
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:24,333
I mean, the thought
that I wouldn't run to the D.A.

-Mom. Please.

521

Do you have a tissue?

522
00:20:27,916 --> 00:20:29,958
You haven't needed a tissue
since Nixon resigned.

523
00:20:30,041 --> 00:20:31,666
I think that you asked Oscar

524
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:33,541
to take her out of town,
didn't you?

525
00:20:33,625 --> 00:20:34,750
I think that you needed her
out of the country

526
00:20:34,833 --> 00:20:36,166
so that you could, what?

527
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:38,625
-Plunder her business?
-Now, listen,

528
00:20:38,708 --> 00:20:41,291
nobody was hurt, everybody's
getting what they deserve.

529
00:20:41,375 --> 00:20:42,750
Buster's in prison.

530
00:20:42,833 --> 00:20:44,416
No, he's in a parade.

531
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:47,458
He's just playing a prisoner.

532
00:20:47,541 --> 00:20:50,166
At least, that's what it looks
like to everyone here.

533
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:53,875
Look, I did what I had to do
to save this family.

534
00:20:53,958 --> 00:20:55,958
There are things
you don't understand.

535
00:20:56,041 --> 00:20:57,541
But he'll be out soon.

536
00:20:57,625 --> 00:21:00,166
I did three years in prison
because of Buster.

537
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:02,708
-He can do a few weeks for me.
-Well, guess what?

538
00:21:02,791 --> 00:21:04,375
He's gonna be out a little bit
sooner than you think,

539
00:21:04,458 --> 00:21:06,166
because I'm gonna go
to Lottie Dottie,

540
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:07,791
and I'm gonna call her
on this photo.

541
00:21:07,875 --> 00:21:09,250
Michael, you stay away
from that D.A.

542
00:21:09,333 --> 00:21:12,416
She's a killer,

543
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:14,916
So, there's nothing you can do.

544

Now, please. We're family.

546
00:21:21,291 --> 00:21:24,208
You stay out of my life,
I'll stay out of yours.

547
00:21:24,291 --> 00:21:25,875
Hmm.

Thank you! Thank you!

549
00:21:27,166 --> 00:21:29,291

Huh? Yes. Hi.

581
00:22:26,541 --> 00:22:29,250
Um, so, does the D.A.'s office
make a regular practice

582
00:22:29,333 --> 00:22:30,625
of holding people under
suspicion of murdering victims

583
00:22:30,708 --> 00:22:32,166
that are clearly still alive?

584
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:34,625
-Huh? -We're not holding him
on murder charges.

585
00:22:34,708 --> 00:22:36,666
It's a tampering case, right?

586
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:39,583
Yeah, well, if there's no crime,
then what has he tampered with?

587
00:22:39,666 --> 00:22:41,166
Lucille Austero's clearly alive

588
00:22:41,250 --> 00:22:43,166

that she disappeared.

That-that's my uncle Oscar.

590

My-my mother just confirmed it.

find him, either,

was the scene of the crime.

Yes. All here.
All in one picture.

This is so embarrassing.

I never even got the chance

It's over.

850
00:33:48,958 --> 00:33:50,291
I'm breaking up with you.

851
00:33:51,958 --> 00:33:53,541
Oh, and I need your keys.

-It's, uh, part of the act.
-Oh.

857
00:34:02,291 --> 00:34:04,125
Anything for the kids.

862
00:34:13,708 --> 00:34:15,833
It seems as if
the Christian-y fellow

863
00:34:15,916 --> 00:34:17,500
is now a gay man,
and by the looks of things,

It's called safety hair.

00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:32,166
Practically undetectable.

871
00:34:32,250 --> 00:34:33,833
They tell me
John Travolta wears his

872
00:34:33,916 --> 00:34:35,291
even when it isn't hailing.

873
00:34:35,375 --> 00:34:37,958
No, no, no. Some clowns throws
so much as a peach pit at you,

874
00:34:38,041 --> 00:34:40,041
it clanks and everybody knows.

875
00:34:40,125 --> 00:34:42,000
No, you want to keep me safe,
let's build that wall.

876
00:34:42,083 --> 00:34:44,583
Those Bluths are dangerous,
I'm telling you.

877
00:34:44,666 --> 00:34:46,458
Yeah, I guess they do have us
by the short wigs.

-Help! Please! We need a doctor!

880
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,708
It's an emergency.
Hi. It's us again. Help!

881
00:34:53,791 --> 00:34:56,000
Did you redo the floors here?

882
00:34:56,083 --> 00:34:57,416
Help, we need a doctor.

883
00:34:57,500 --> 00:34:58,833
Oh!

884
00:34:58,916 --> 00:35:00,833
It's okay.
She's usually on pain pills.

885
00:35:00,916 --> 00:35:02,416
Ugh. I'm gonna call it.

886
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:04,250
Looks like she's been stiff
for about 18 hours.

887
00:35:04,333 --> 00:35:05,750
Oh, no, no.
She's very much alive.

888
00:35:05,833 --> 00:35:07,083
She just crashed through
a papier-mâché wall.

889

DeBRIE:
I'm under the impression

890
00:35:09,458 --> 00:35:10,833
that if you're carried in

891
00:35:10,916 --> 00:35:12,541
they put you immediately
on the morphine drip?

892
00:35:12,625 --> 00:35:14,625
-That's what we've been
told before. -Okay, look.

893
00:35:14,708 --> 00:35:16,166
-We prioritize according
to need. -Of course.

894
00:35:16,250 --> 00:35:19,250
-Here.
-Oh, okay. All right.

895
00:35:19,333 --> 00:35:22,791
Help! Please! It's
a higher priority emergency!

896
00:35:22,875 --> 00:35:24,291
Help!

897
00:35:24,375 --> 00:35:25,666
Oh, bullshit you didn't redo
these floors.

898
00:35:25,750 --> 00:35:27,166
They look amazing. (chuckles)

899
00:35:29,791 --> 00:35:31,041
Help!

900
00:35:31,125 --> 00:35:33,250
I got to stop
coming out this way.
