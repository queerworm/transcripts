You sure? We all ended at the same time.

10

That's because you all sped up together.

I would say,

"Hey, let's do the whole
fast and loose with tempo thing."

-Could you even hear the woodblock?
-Right at the end.

21
00:01:06,524 --> 00:01:09,319
We could record you separately

Then I'm not playing in a band.

23

Sounds like a mother of an invention.

162

163

-There's my hero!

170

You know the doctor said if that bird

171
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:51,262
had gotten through
my second layer of makeup,

172
00:07:51,345 --> 00:07:53,097
it could have done permanent damage
to my skin.

173
00:07:53,181 --> 00:07:54,974
And I want to repay you.

174
00:07:55,266 --> 00:07:57,643
You're a doctor. And you're out of work.

175
00:07:57,727 --> 00:07:59,479
-Well--
-How would you like to work for me?

176
00:08:00,021 --> 00:08:00,938
At Austerity.

177
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:03,024
The rehab center? That's yours?

178

My brother Argyle runs it day to day,

179
00:08:06,777 --> 00:08:07,862
You'd be such a gift.

180
00:08:07,945 --> 00:08:10,740

Oh, yeah.

193
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:45,566

-How is that a chicken noise?
-You know.

204
00:09:10,174 --> 00:09:13,761
Look, it's kind of hard to do

206
00:09:16,764 --> 00:09:18,516
[man]<i> FakeBlock is available.</i>
<i>Would you like to take it?</i>

207
00:09:18,641 --> 00:09:19,767
Okay. They have FakeBlock.

208
00:09:20,351 --> 00:09:21,435
Okay, yes, we'll take that.

209
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:23,521
<i>-That will be $5000.</i>
-That's no problem.

Could you hang on to that for me, please,

211
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:30,486
It's $5,000 for the domain name,

XML website fee.

213

I got the last one.

214
00:09:35,074 --> 00:09:36,325

216
00:09:37,743 --> 00:09:40,705
[narrator] <i>That's what led George Michael</i>
<i>to the Student Employment Office.</i>

217
00:09:40,788 --> 00:09:42,248
We actually have a variety of subjects

218
00:09:42,331 --> 00:09:44,000
that high school students
need tutoring in.

219
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:46,419

221
00:09:47,712 --> 00:09:48,879
[narrator]<i> There was.</i>

222
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:52,675
<i>Although George Michael couldn't imagine</i>
<i>it was the same Maeby.</i>

223
00:09:52,758 --> 00:09:56,554
Is this F in "Maeby F" her last name
or her grade?

224
00:09:56,637 --> 00:09:58,931
It's her last name.
But her most recent grade is...

225
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:02,393
Well, this just shows
an Elvis Presley head.

226
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:04,604
So, that bad?

227
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:06,897
I'll take her.

228
00:10:07,773 --> 00:10:10,568
Stay on top of her.
You need to ride her pretty hard.

229
00:10:10,651 --> 00:10:12,361
Don't be afraid to crack the whip.

00:10:18,117 --> 00:10:20,578

I can't wear this.

234
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:29,545
Well, we dated for a while,
but, you know, I was a kid,

235
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:30,796
and I didn't know how to kiss yet.

236
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:33,424
I don't know, for whatever reason,
I listened to my dad,

237
00:10:33,507 --> 00:10:34,925
who said we shouldn't make it work.

238
00:10:35,009 --> 00:10:36,636
-Was she your first?
-Cousin? No.

239
00:10:36,886 --> 00:10:38,971
Why would your mind go right to-- No.

240
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:41,599
It's just, he was right. We were kids.

241
00:10:41,682 --> 00:10:43,017
I wasn't yet O.S.

242
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:44,477
-"Overtly Sexual."
-Right.

243
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:45,853
As I live and breathe.

244
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:47,897
Crazy. That's just crazy.

245
00:10:48,189 --> 00:10:50,024
-[knocking at door]
-Okay, so listen...

246
00:10:50,191 --> 00:10:53,694
after I let her in, you go
and try and keep my dad out. All right?

247
00:10:53,819 --> 00:10:54,987
I can't let him get in the way
of this one.

248
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:56,113
Hey, you must be--

249
00:10:56,197 --> 00:10:58,074
[narrator]
<i>But first, he had to cover his tracks.</i>

250
00:10:58,157 --> 00:10:59,909
-What?
<i>-This had to look like fate.</i>

251
00:10:59,992 --> 00:11:01,786

252
00:11:01,869 --> 00:11:04,205

253
00:11:05,873 --> 00:11:06,957

254
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:09,794
<i>But for the phrase,</i>
<i>"As I live and breathe,"</i> <i>he nailed it.</i>

255
00:11:09,877 --> 00:11:12,421
-I'm supposed to tutor a kid from--
-High school. Yeah.

256
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:14,298
-That's me.
-Crazy.

257
00:11:14,382 --> 00:11:15,591
That is just crazy.

258
00:11:15,716 --> 00:11:17,051
[narrator] <i>And despite his deceit,</i>

259
00:11:17,134 --> 00:11:20,638
<i>he couldn't help but challenge</i>
<i>her strategy for staying in high school.</i>

260
00:11:20,721 --> 00:11:23,849
You have to make a living, right?
Don't you need an education?

261
00:11:23,974 --> 00:11:27,228
-Don't forget, I'm a Harris.
-Harris?

262
00:11:27,561 --> 00:11:30,314
Yeah, someone who "in-harris"
a lot of money.

263
00:11:30,439 --> 00:11:32,525
Oh, an "heiress." Yeah, well...

264
00:11:32,775 --> 00:11:34,902
I wouldn't put all my ands in that basket.

265
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:39,115
You know, it's fine. You don't get it.
You've never been a risk-taker.

266
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:41,659
I like to [bleep] with people.
That's what I do.

267
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:44,370
-I'm making a statement.
-[P-Hound] I love it.

[narrator]<i> It seemed George Michael</i>

<i>in the double castle.</i>

00:11:50,793 --> 00:11:51,794
I get it too.

272
00:11:52,336 --> 00:11:53,504
I love it too.

273
00:11:53,587 --> 00:11:57,466
<i>George Michael found himself</i>
<i>less overtly sexual than he'd hoped.</i>

274
00:11:57,842 --> 00:12:00,177
I made a 40-year-old woman cry in Spain.

275
00:12:00,469 --> 00:12:02,555
I love making love to Spanish women.

276
00:12:02,638 --> 00:12:03,472
Get out.

<i>And with his roommate gone,</i>

278
00:12:04,974 --> 00:12:07,935
<i>George Michael slipped back</i>
<i>into seduction mode.</i>

279
00:12:08,018 --> 00:12:09,562
So... a man, a woman.

280
00:12:10,646 --> 00:12:13,107
Let's solve for "X."

281
00:12:15,109 --> 00:12:16,610
I don't know you're talking about.

282
00:12:16,944 --> 00:12:21,323
In algebra, you have an unknown element,
and we call it "X,"

283
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:24,493
and then you have to solve for it
to find out what number X is.

284
00:12:25,327 --> 00:12:26,662
"X" isn't a number.

285
00:12:27,329 --> 00:12:29,540
You don't even really know... the basic...

286
00:12:29,665 --> 00:12:32,960
[narrator] <i>But in that moment, the urge</i>
<i>to educate her was more powerful</i>

287

<i>-than the urge to kiss her.</i>
-Let me show you real quick.

288
00:12:35,379 --> 00:12:38,507
{\an8}So if you take something like this:
"3x+1 = 10"...

289
00:12:38,716 --> 00:12:41,135
[narrator]
<i>And with the algebra lesson complete,</i>

290
00:12:41,218 --> 00:12:45,014
<i>George Michael pivoted back</i>
<i>to his overtly sexual seduction.</i>

291
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:48,184
When I say, "You and me and a bedroom,

292
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:50,603
let's solve for 'X,'" um...

293
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:53,439
I'm stating it as a kind of formula.

294
00:12:53,731 --> 00:12:57,109
Yeah, let's get wasted.
Let's drink that formula.

295
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:59,278
It's not that kind of formula.

296
00:12:59,361 --> 00:13:01,655
I'll show you what a formula is
real quick, 'cause that's very important.

-No.

Tell her, pal.

306
00:13:19,131 --> 00:13:22,134
So, it's privacy software
that's also anti-piracy?

307
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:25,012
<i>George Michael weighed his options.</i>

308
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:28,766
<i>Maeby had chastised him</i>
<i>for not taking risks,</i>

309
00:13:28,891 --> 00:13:33,062
<i>and what would be a bigger risk</i>
<i>than perpetuating a lie about software</i>

310
00:13:33,145 --> 00:13:35,648
<i>just to ignite the passions of a woman?</i>

311
00:13:35,731 --> 00:13:37,399
<i>Of course it would be a lie,</i>

312
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:39,902
<i>and since Maeby wouldn't know</i>
<i>it was a lie,</i>

313
00:13:39,985 --> 00:13:42,071
<i>he wouldn't appear to be taking a risk.</i>

314
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:46,075
<i>Perhaps the bigger risk</i>
<i>was to tell his father he was lying.</i>

315
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:49,411
<i>That he came up with it</i>
<i>because he wanted his father to leave</i>

316

<i>so he could enjoy what remained</i>
<i>of his senior year.</i>

317

<i>After all, he wondered, wouldn't that be</i>

318

319

<i>A man who owns a pair of matador pants?</i>

320
00:14:02,049 --> 00:14:04,677
<i>He had not responded now for 41 seconds,</i>
