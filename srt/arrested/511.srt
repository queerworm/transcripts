00:06:41,609 --> 00:06:42,985
[phone slams, smashes]

164
00:06:43,361 --> 00:06:46,197
-Well, the Chinese want dinner with us.
-[George Sr.] They're in town?

165
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:49,534
-They want to go over plans for the wall.
-[George Sr. stammers] Wait.

166
00:06:49,617 --> 00:06:52,203
Did you tell them we don't have Lindsay?
We lost the election.

167
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,540
We can't catch a break on this.

168
00:06:55,623 --> 00:06:58,376
It makes you not even want to do business
with a hostile nation.

169
00:06:58,876 --> 00:07:00,586
[Lucille] They're gonna demand
their money, and...

170
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:02,672
Oh, this dinner is not going to be fun.

171
00:07:02,755 --> 00:07:06,217
[Ron] <i>But being fun was something</i>
<i>George was eager to prove.</i>

172
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:09,387
Know what looks like fun?
That tandem bicycle built for two.

173
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:12,890
-How much fun would that be?
-What are you, nuts?

174
00:07:12,974 --> 00:07:14,392
I have to call the restaurant.

175
00:07:14,475 --> 00:07:16,811
You call.
I'm gonna check out the Tent City.

176
00:07:16,894 --> 00:07:19,439
They have tandem bikes.
Boy, would we have fun on that.

177
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:21,149
[speaking Chinese]

178
00:07:21,232 --> 00:07:25,069
[Ron] <i>And that's when George Sr. did find</i>
<i>the more fun version of himself...</i>

179
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:29,073
<i>His brother, Oscar.</i>

180
00:07:30,658 --> 00:07:31,742
[George Sr.] Hey.

181
00:07:33,911 --> 00:07:36,080
I should've gone
to the Tent City in Santa Ana.

182
00:07:36,164 --> 00:07:38,040
[George Sr.] You have Buster
stashed away somewhere.

183
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:40,418
[Oscar] What do you mean, in a tent?

184
00:07:41,043 --> 00:07:42,837
[whispers] Are you gonna turn me in?

185
00:07:43,171 --> 00:07:47,758
No one's chasing you, okay?
Buster's a free man. Here's proof.

186
00:07:47,842 --> 00:07:49,469
They throw these in with the posters.

187
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:51,971
Actually, he's not technically free.

188
00:07:52,054 --> 00:07:56,893
He still has to officially sign out
from prison and pay their $75 process fee.

189
00:07:57,435 --> 00:08:00,229
So, hey, Daddy, you're the one paying.

190
00:08:00,521 --> 00:08:04,525
[Oscar] Gee, I'm kind of sorry
my time with Buster has to come to an end.

191
00:08:04,609 --> 00:08:06,736
-We're getting close.
-[George Sr.] Tell me about it.

192
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:09,614
I'm trying to win back Lucille,
but it's a little tough right now.

193
00:08:09,697 --> 00:08:11,157
I'm fighting against the competition.

194
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:12,533
What, is she dating?

195
00:08:12,617 --> 00:08:14,327
No, I'm talking about Buster.

196
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:18,247
And we're really bonding over
this "we miss our son" bullshit.

197
00:08:18,456 --> 00:08:21,751
[Oscar] Well, I'll tell you what.
You front me the $75 to sign him

198
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:24,837
out of prison, maybe we keep
this "Buster's on the run" charade

199
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:26,255
going a little longer.

200
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:28,758
[Ron] <i>And so a deal was made.</i>

201
00:08:28,841 --> 00:08:32,011
<i>But before Oscar could even</i>
<i>not share the news with Buster</i>

202
00:08:32,094 --> 00:08:33,763
<i>that they weren't on the run,</i>

203
00:08:33,846 --> 00:08:37,934
<i>Tobias would not solve a mystery</i>
<i>he wasn't trying to solve himself.</i>

204
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:39,685
Oh, sorry, wrong tent. I...

205
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:41,979
What am I doing, apologizing
to a mannequin that looks like--

206
00:08:42,063 --> 00:08:45,066
-Buster?
-[Oscar] Oh, guys, keep it down.

207
00:08:45,316 --> 00:08:47,735
I can hear you all the way in cano--

208
00:08:50,613 --> 00:08:51,948
What are you doing here?

209
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:54,075
-Tobias?
-[Tobias] I live here.

210
00:08:54,158 --> 00:08:56,494
-So do we.
-Oh, not for long.

211
00:08:56,577 --> 00:08:58,329
Rumor has it they're gonna
knock down these tents

212
00:08:58,412 --> 00:09:01,123
-and put in a Santa Ski Village.
-Wow.

213
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:03,501
Seems like we were just celebrating
the second of July.

214
00:09:03,584 --> 00:09:05,419
We're already talking
about December 19.

215
00:09:05,503 --> 00:09:07,755
Well, we're definitely
still on the run.

216
00:09:07,838 --> 00:09:09,507
[Buster] Too bad
we can't go back to Maeby's.

217
00:09:09,924 --> 00:09:13,386
She had quite a sweet setup
over at the Spotted Palm.

218
00:09:13,469 --> 00:09:15,763
My daughter has a place
at the Spotted Palm?

219
00:09:15,846 --> 00:09:16,764
[Oscar] Yeah.

220
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:20,893
She should get better acquainted
with her sibling and mother impersonator.

221
00:09:20,977 --> 00:09:23,271
No, you have to be 55 and older.

222
00:09:23,354 --> 00:09:24,939
Well, that sounds like a challenge

223
00:09:25,022 --> 00:09:28,109
to any family that wasn't
a ragtag troupe of folks

224
00:09:28,192 --> 00:09:30,194
whom I wish to become actors. [chuckling]

225
00:09:33,322 --> 00:09:35,741
[Ron] <i>As it turned out,</i>
<i>Tobias's daughter, Maeby,</i>

226
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:38,244
<i>had been playing a part herself,</i>

227
00:09:38,327 --> 00:09:41,122
<i>although she was eager</i>
<i>to recast the love interest.</i>

228
00:09:41,455 --> 00:09:43,040
Hey, how we feeling?

229
00:09:43,124 --> 00:09:44,333
-Any better?
-[exhales]

230
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:45,626
-I don't know.
-The doctor said

231
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:47,795
the headache should be gone at this point.

232
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:49,630
But I'm having trouble tracking time.

233
00:09:49,964 --> 00:09:51,340
But I guess it's only been a day

234
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:53,551
-since the accident, right?
-Oh, my God.

235
00:09:53,843 --> 00:09:55,886
I can't believe
you're asking me this again.

236
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:58,306
-Have I asked before?
-[Ron] <i>He hadn't.</i>

237
00:09:58,389 --> 00:10:01,559
-Every month.
-Oh, no. That can't be

238
00:10:01,642 --> 00:10:03,144
-right.
-Right.

239
00:10:03,227 --> 00:10:05,104
See? You always say "right."

240
00:10:05,187 --> 00:10:09,233
[chuckles] I'm sorry, it's just, Stan,
we've gone over this so many times.

241
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:10,818
[Ron] <i>No, they hadn't.</i>

242
00:10:10,901 --> 00:10:13,821
<i>In fact, this had only happened</i>
<i>a few hours earlier.</i>

243
00:10:13,904 --> 00:10:15,573
-Oh.
-[gasps]

244
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:18,451
-I must seem like a broken record.
-Old man.

245
00:10:19,702 --> 00:10:21,996
You also always say "old man."

246
00:10:22,747 --> 00:10:26,459
Listen, Stan,
this isn't easy for me to say.

247
00:10:26,542 --> 00:10:30,296
I've let you stay here
because I felt responsible for...

248
00:10:31,797 --> 00:10:33,299
coming in just as those two men

249
00:10:33,382 --> 00:10:35,259
hit you over the head,
which you thought was me.

250
00:10:35,509 --> 00:10:38,638
And it wasn't because I was just trying
to stop them, you know?

251
00:10:39,055 --> 00:10:40,598
But before that,

252
00:10:40,681 --> 00:10:42,558
we did end things between us.

253
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:44,352
I know, but maybe

254
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:47,480
there's some spark, there's some way
that we can rekindle,

255
00:10:47,563 --> 00:10:49,440
now that I'm alone
and you're alone, and...

256
00:10:49,523 --> 00:10:51,108
Right, we're alone.

257
00:10:51,275 --> 00:10:53,277
I don't have two criminals to pin it on.

258
00:10:53,944 --> 00:10:55,738
Maybe we can try again.

259
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:59,700
-[doorbell rings]
-[sighs] I was trying, Stan, okay?

260
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:02,411
It's over. It is over!

261
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:04,580
[Tobias] A real lady lets it itch.

262
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:06,832
She doesn't jam two fingers...

looking for a place
to rest our weary asses.

271

Oh, [bleep].

272
00:11:32,274 --> 00:11:35,569

-Hello.

273
00:11:36,487 --> 00:11:39,782
[Ron] <i>Back at the cottage,</i>
<i>George Sr. kept up the illusion</i>

274

I don't know about you,

that I can't keep looking anymore.

277
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:49,500
Me, too.
We have to take care of ourselves.

278
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:52,503
Why don't we just order some dinner in?
What do you think of that?

279
00:11:52,586 --> 00:11:55,423
George, it's two o'clock. Go home.

280
00:11:55,506 --> 00:11:59,844
I was thinking, it could be a, um, dry run
for tomorrow night's dinner

281
00:11:59,927 --> 00:12:01,887
with the Chinese.
They're gonna be looking at us,

282
00:12:01,971 --> 00:12:05,391
Lucille, very closely,
and we have to be a real team.

283
00:12:05,474 --> 00:12:07,268
You know, in the Chinese culture,

284
00:12:07,435 --> 00:12:11,439
a good marriage portends
a good business relationship.

285
00:12:11,814 --> 00:12:15,025
I think I can eat a piece of fish
without giving away how I loathe you.

286
00:12:15,109 --> 00:12:16,861
[chuckles] Whoops. Now, see?

287
00:12:16,986 --> 00:12:20,906
It's those little inadvertent slips I fear

288
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:24,410
will come out tomorrow night
if we go in cold.

289
00:12:24,493 --> 00:12:27,204
Well, then it's a good thing
I've asked my friend to stop by,

290
00:12:27,288 --> 00:12:30,624

on the Far East, as it turns out.

-Your friend, you don't...
-Oh, Dusty.

292
00:12:33,169 --> 00:12:35,838

What's your business on the beach, bro?

300
00:12:51,896 --> 00:12:54,273
I'm, uh, visiting... [coughs, pants]

301
00:12:54,356 --> 00:12:58,068
...visiting my wife, Lucille Bluth,
and I just... [sniffling]

-[Dusty] What?
-Yeah.

303
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:01,155
Well, that's why you look familiar.

304
00:13:01,238 --> 00:13:03,532
I helped her take down
all your pictures.

You're Dustin Radler.

Sorry about the confusion, man.

308
00:13:11,248 --> 00:13:12,750
Yeah, this beach
has always been known

309
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:14,877
as territory of the Newport Bay Boys.

310
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:18,506
Okay, uh, I'll just...
I'll find my way out of...

311
00:13:18,589 --> 00:13:20,382
No, no, you're not using those steps.

312
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:22,802
Those steps are just
for the feet of the Bay Boys.

313
00:13:22,927 --> 00:13:24,386
Get back in the ball, dude.

314
00:13:25,387 --> 00:13:27,681
But I... I-- I ca...

315
00:13:27,765 --> 00:13:29,517
Okay. Could you tell Lucille, uh...

316
00:13:30,017 --> 00:13:31,393
that I-- I died...

317
00:13:32,603 --> 00:13:34,438
doing something that looked fun?

318
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:38,192
-Ay.
-[George Sr.] <i>The Bay Boy?</i>

319
00:13:38,275 --> 00:13:39,860
<i>I ought to throw this guy out of here.</i>

320
00:13:39,944 --> 00:13:42,363
This is the goddamn expert?
Because the only thing he's expert at

321
00:13:42,446 --> 00:13:44,615
is getting sand out of his trunks

322
00:13:44,698 --> 00:13:46,367
and pissing on another man's tree.

323
00:13:46,575 --> 00:13:48,828
-And the law.
-And I play some guitar.

324
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:52,832
And I know a lot about Eastern culture,
too. I surfed in 'Nam.

325
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,167
-Oh, you served in Vietnam?
-Surfed.

326
00:13:55,251 --> 00:13:56,836
I <i>surfed </i>in Vietnam.

327
00:13:57,169 --> 00:13:58,504
Two group tours.

328
00:13:58,587 --> 00:14:03,467
Picked up a lot, too. Mostly tchotchkes,
but some cultural elements, too.

329
00:14:03,551 --> 00:14:05,302
He knows what he's talking about, George.

330
00:14:05,386 --> 00:14:08,430
We went for sushi last night,
and he never touched his fork.

331
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:11,058
Well, a little bit for the rice.
It's the hard part.

332
00:14:11,141 --> 00:14:12,643
But not when the guy was looking.

333
00:14:12,726 --> 00:14:14,562
[Lucille] He didn't want
to insult the employees.

334
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:18,357
You know, with all these Asia-y cultures
and, uh, whatnot,

335
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:20,609
they all are interested in honor.

336
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:24,029
They all understand
that your opponent needs to save face,

337
00:14:24,113 --> 00:14:26,323
for this is the only way you, yourself,

338
00:14:26,824 --> 00:14:28,492
-will save face.
-[Lucille] Oh.

339
00:14:28,576 --> 00:14:30,369
[Dusty]
So, I just want to be clear with you.

340
00:14:30,452 --> 00:14:35,124
If you think that I enjoy being put
in the position of ridiculing you,

341
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:36,750
intimidating you, emasculating you,

342
00:14:36,834 --> 00:14:38,460
you're wrong, little guy.

343
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:40,254
-Could you--
-[Dusty] Wrong.

344
00:14:40,337 --> 00:14:43,549
Could you excuse us for just one mom--
I'm gonna talk to my wife.

345
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:46,886
Yes. I will give you that respect.

346
00:14:47,219 --> 00:14:49,722
Maybe I'll just go upstairs
and watch the big TV.

347
00:14:49,805 --> 00:14:51,515
[Ron] <i>But someone else</i>
<i>would soon show up</i>

348
00:14:51,599 --> 00:14:53,809
<i>who was tired of being emasculated.</i>

349
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:55,477
Ah, of course.

350
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:57,479
I knew you would both be here.

351
00:14:57,563 --> 00:15:00,149
[George Sr.] Michael, finally.
We need this money.

352
00:15:00,232 --> 00:15:02,735
So, uh, how's that going?
Did you-- Did you find anything?

353
00:15:02,818 --> 00:15:05,613
You could say that. Yeah.
You both wanted me to go look

354
00:15:05,696 --> 00:15:10,534
at the books, but I guess you didn't think
that I was smart enough to find this.

355
00:15:11,535 --> 00:15:16,081
This was a file on a computer drive
called "Gated Community."

356
00:15:16,457 --> 00:15:18,459
-What is that?
-Don't play dumb.

357
00:15:18,792 --> 00:15:22,546
-[stammers] What's playing dumb?
-Stop it. You know exactly what this is.

358
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:24,340
This is a border wall

359
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:26,800
between Mexico and America.

360
00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:29,053
That doesn't look like a mouth to you?

361
00:15:29,136 --> 00:15:31,805
[Michael] Well, you gotta get rid
of the tongue setting, and anyway,

362
00:15:31,889 --> 00:15:33,974
but on a regular printer,
I have more than enough proof

363
00:15:34,058 --> 00:15:36,018
that you guys are building a wall.

364
00:15:36,101 --> 00:15:37,436
<i>The </i>wall, okay?

365
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:39,188
Between America and Mexico.

366
00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:41,398
A wall, by the way,
that you once claimed

367
00:15:41,482 --> 00:15:42,566
-to be on the other side of.
-[George Sr.] No.

368
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:46,278
The property is
on the other side of the wall.

369
00:15:46,362 --> 00:15:49,448
Th-- That's all over now
because the Mexican Romney said

370
00:15:49,531 --> 00:15:50,658
<i>no refundo.</i>

371
00:15:50,741 --> 00:15:52,785
I mean, we can't even pay back
the investors.

372
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:54,495
[whispering] They're Chinese.

373
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,413
There's Chinese Romneys?

374
00:15:56,497 --> 00:15:59,416
[George Sr.] No, the only Romneys
are the Mexican Romneys.

375
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,502
-Well, and the regular Romneys.
-Well, I mean, yes.

376
00:16:01,585 --> 00:16:03,379
Obviously the-- the regular Romneys,
but...

377
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:05,965
So you spent Chinese money
that you cannot return,

378
00:16:06,048 --> 00:16:09,009
and you wanted me to look
in the books, so that I would

379
00:16:09,343 --> 00:16:13,097
do the right thing for the family
and offer to sell off Sudden Valley?

380
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:16,016
The only thing that you cannot sell off
without me, right?

381
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:18,185
And then what,
you give the money to the Chinese?

382
00:16:18,268 --> 00:16:20,729
We just wanted to tell them
where we were first going

383
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:23,065
to build a-- a model wall, a prototype.

384
00:16:23,273 --> 00:16:25,067
By that time,
there will have been the election,

385
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:26,860
and Hillary doesn't want a wall.

386
00:16:27,528 --> 00:16:28,862
Yes, that is a good point.

387
00:16:28,946 --> 00:16:32,533
I wish her voice weren't so grating.
Oh, that voice!

388
00:16:32,616 --> 00:16:34,076
Shrillary. [laughs]

389
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:35,244
[clattering nearby]

390
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:36,829
You okay? Is everybody all right?

391
00:16:36,912 --> 00:16:38,038
Yeah, we're fine. Go on.

392
00:16:38,122 --> 00:16:39,832
-Go on upstairs.
-Right on.

393
00:16:40,249 --> 00:16:43,085
I got an idea. Why don't you just try
being honest with the Chinese?

394
00:16:45,629 --> 00:16:46,505
In what way?

395
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,340
You tell them the truth, Dad.

396
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:50,551
-What truth?
-[Michael] You made a mistake.

397
00:16:50,634 --> 00:16:52,094
You lost the money. You feel bad.

398
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:54,179
Nothing you can do.
You hope they understand.

399
00:16:56,765 --> 00:16:58,600
I have no idea what you're talking about.

400
00:16:58,684 --> 00:17:00,144
Oh, good. You better figure it out,

401
00:17:00,227 --> 00:17:02,438
'cause I'm not gonna let you
ruin the family again.

402
00:17:02,813 --> 00:17:04,189
[scoffs] This generation.

403
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:06,775
They go to one therapy session,
and all of a sudden

404
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:08,402
their parents are "terrible people,"

405
00:17:08,485 --> 00:17:10,279
because they once sold tract homes to--

406
00:17:10,612 --> 00:17:12,197
God, who even remembers now?

407
00:17:13,991 --> 00:17:15,075
Saddam Hussein.

408
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:16,869
Yeah. So-- I mean, something like that.

409
00:17:17,077 --> 00:17:19,455
[Ron] <i>Michael's parents</i>
<i>weren't the only ones</i>

410
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:21,206
<i>using him for Sudden Valley,</i>

411
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:22,666
<i>as Oscar,</i>
<i>who was trying to convince Buster</i>

412
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:24,334
<i>they were still fugitives,</i>

413
00:17:24,418 --> 00:17:26,670
<i>had agreed to move into the attic.</i>

414
00:17:26,754 --> 00:17:30,049
Are you sure nobody saw us get
in the truck once we found it?

415
00:17:30,132 --> 00:17:32,593
Yeah, can you believe we finally
come across the getaway truck,

416
00:17:32,676 --> 00:17:35,596
right after we find out
we're no longer, uh...

417
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:37,639
I mean, I hope not.

418
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:40,350
-Me, too. Me, too.
-It didn't help things

419
00:17:40,434 --> 00:17:42,144
when your hand flew off
on the 405, but...

420
00:17:42,227 --> 00:17:43,729
Well, it's probably behind the seat.

421
00:17:43,812 --> 00:17:45,314
And did you notice that banner?

422
00:17:45,647 --> 00:17:48,609
It said, "Welcome Home
From Prison Again, Buster."

423
00:17:48,692 --> 00:17:51,945
I mean, it's like, did they expect me
to come home from prison?

424
00:17:52,029 --> 00:17:54,698
Yeah. I think they were just being ironic.

425
00:17:54,782 --> 00:17:56,158
-I mean, it's like a...
-Oh.

426
00:17:56,241 --> 00:17:57,951
A not-surprise party.

427
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:01,371
Like if Buster was coming home,
he'd expect a surprise party,

428
00:18:01,455 --> 00:18:03,040
so it wouldn't be a surprise.
Since he's in jail,

429
00:18:03,123 --> 00:18:05,918
we're gonna throw a party and not tell
him since there won't be guests.

430
00:18:06,001 --> 00:18:08,212
-Yep.
-[chuckling] Well,

431
00:18:08,295 --> 00:18:10,631
I am surprised she went through
all that trouble.

432
00:18:11,048 --> 00:18:12,716
-Oh, so I guess it worked.
-Mm-hmm.

433
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:14,927
But I hope this is okay for you.

434
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:16,220
-Oh.
-'Cause it might be

435
00:18:16,303 --> 00:18:17,846
a couple of months.

436
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:20,933
Oh, we're not gonna be up here
for a couple of months.

437
00:18:21,016 --> 00:18:23,310
I mean, I can't do that.
I mean, that's-- For me,

438
00:18:23,393 --> 00:18:26,021
-that's, uh, pretty scary.
-No.

439
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:29,274
Because we're the Inside-Outside Bandits,

440
00:18:29,358 --> 00:18:33,362
and the only thing
that scares us is not being safe and cozy.

441
00:18:33,904 --> 00:18:36,073
A guy could have a mighty nice life
up here.

442
00:18:36,156 --> 00:18:40,744
Do you...
You want us to die here together?

443
00:18:42,496 --> 00:18:43,789
You're hungry.

444
00:18:43,872 --> 00:18:46,583
I'll go downstairs
and get us some food.

445
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,753
-How does gummies sound?
-Necessary.

446
00:18:49,837 --> 00:18:51,755
-[both chuckling]
-I don't get it.

447
00:18:52,172 --> 00:18:53,799
[groans]

448
00:18:53,882 --> 00:18:56,343
[Ron] <i>But the model house</i>
<i>had another visitor.</i>

449
00:18:58,262 --> 00:18:59,221
[Gob grunting]

450
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:02,391
Good, Buster. I saw your truck.

451
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:04,601
Glad you're here. Hey, uh...

452
00:19:05,561 --> 00:19:09,356
So I'm gonna kind of need your help

453
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:12,276
with a little, uh, "magic trick" of sorts.

454
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:13,777
-So, favor.
-[groans]

455
00:19:14,403 --> 00:19:16,405
I cannot do you a favor, Gob.

456
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:18,866
I am on the lam. I escaped from jail.

457
00:19:19,074 --> 00:19:22,077
Escaped. Yeah, I don't think so.

458
00:19:23,495 --> 00:19:24,830
-They released you, Buster.
-No.

459
00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:28,500
-Oscar freed me.
-I don't think so.

460
00:19:28,584 --> 00:19:31,211
Uh, I think I'd know if I wasn't
on the lam. [chuckles]

461
00:19:31,295 --> 00:19:33,755
I mean, unless he happened
to do that exactly

462
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:35,632
when I was released,
so I thought I was running,

463
00:19:35,716 --> 00:19:37,718
-but... wasn't.
-Right.

464
00:19:37,801 --> 00:19:40,387
But that would also be
what exactly what happened, but...

465
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:42,306
Yeah, but Oscar and I are living
in the attic.

466
00:19:42,389 --> 00:19:45,767
I mean, that's because I'm a wanted man.

467
00:19:46,143 --> 00:19:48,020
Impossible.
You weren't even a wanted child.

468
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:50,522
[Ron] <i>Which reminded Buster</i>
<i>of the poster</i>

469
00:19:50,606 --> 00:19:52,983
<i>he'd seen earlier that day at the mall,</i>

470
00:19:53,066 --> 00:19:55,694
<i>and which he now realized</i>
<i>had another meaning.</i>

471
00:19:55,777 --> 00:19:57,362
[Buster] <i>So no one's out there looking</i>
<i>for me?</i>

472
00:19:57,613 --> 00:19:59,865
But if that's true, I guess technically

473
00:19:59,948 --> 00:20:01,825
now we don't have to live in the attic.

474
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:05,245
So I'll just go back to living
with George Sr. as my father,

475
00:20:05,329 --> 00:20:08,749
and then Oscar can go back to his life
with-- without me.

476
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:11,418
Well, that's good news for him, huh?

477
00:20:11,501 --> 00:20:12,711
Please don't tell him.

478
00:20:13,378 --> 00:20:16,215
He's-- He's in my life now,
and-- and I know it's not honest,

479
00:20:16,298 --> 00:20:18,383
but I want to kind of keep that going
a bit longer.

480
00:20:21,094 --> 00:20:22,554
Your secret is safe with me, Buster.

481
00:20:22,638 --> 00:20:25,015
-[gasps]
-No strings attached.

482
00:20:25,098 --> 00:20:27,726
-Aw. [groans]
-If...

483
00:20:27,809 --> 00:20:31,772
you help me get rid of this big,
dead-body-shaped thing.

484
00:20:31,855 --> 00:20:33,815
-What is it?
-I just told you, it's...

485
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:35,108
[Buster] Mm.

486
00:20:36,026 --> 00:20:38,820
It's from a magician friend.
It was part of his big...

487
00:20:41,615 --> 00:20:44,534
his big final farewell disappearing act.

488
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:48,163
Need I remind you, Buster,
that as my one-time assistant,

489
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:51,333
you are still bound by the
magician's assistant oath.

490
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:55,796
Mm. Say no more.

491
00:20:59,174 --> 00:21:01,969
-[Gob] Bye, Oscar.
-[Oscar] I'm on the phone!

492
00:21:02,219 --> 00:21:04,554
{\an8}[Ron] <i>On the next </i>Arrested Development...

493
00:21:04,805 --> 00:21:09,101
<i>Gob makes good on his second obligation</i>

494
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:12,813
<i>by arriving</i>
<i>for heterosexual conversion therapy...</i>

495
00:21:12,896 --> 00:21:15,482
My name is Gob Bluth.
I'm here for a 12:30 un-gaying.

496
00:21:15,565 --> 00:21:17,567
[Ron]
<i>...determined to prove it doesn't work.</i>

497
00:21:17,651 --> 00:21:19,695
Hey, Gob. It's me, Ann's mother.

498
00:21:20,362 --> 00:21:21,363
Who?

499
00:21:21,446 --> 00:21:24,908
That's the one. So I just have
some papers for you to sign.

500
00:21:24,992 --> 00:21:27,536
Just some legalese stating that
if you kill yourself

501
00:21:27,619 --> 00:21:30,539
as a result of the therapy,
it's your fault, not ours.

502
00:21:31,331 --> 00:21:35,460
Yeah. Boy, wish I could pray
that sweater away.

503
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:39,172
[Ron] <i>Unfortunately for Gob...</i>

504
00:21:39,256 --> 00:21:41,883
-Uh-oh.
-<i>...it works a little too well.</i>

505
00:21:44,678 --> 00:21:47,472
<i>Oscar and Buster attempt</i>
<i>to keep each other in the dark...</i>

506
00:21:47,556 --> 00:21:49,224
[Oscar] We should keep an eye out
for cops.

507
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:50,726
[Buster] I'm watching out for cops.

508
00:21:50,851 --> 00:21:52,978
[Ron]
<i>...but can't resist a non-gummy dinner.</i>

509
00:21:53,061 --> 00:21:54,563
So where should we go out?

510
00:21:54,646 --> 00:21:57,566
-There's a Coco's by the beach.
-Oh...

511
00:21:57,649 --> 00:21:59,192
There's a Coco's in town.

512
00:21:59,276 --> 00:22:01,194
-Let's do it.
-[Buster laughs]

513
00:22:01,278 --> 00:22:04,072
[Ron] <i>Although Buster decides</i>
<i>to run an errand</i>

514
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:05,532
<i>for his brother on the way.</i>

515
00:22:05,615 --> 00:22:07,659
[Buster] Just dropping off something
for Gob.

516
00:22:07,743 --> 00:22:08,744
It'll take me a second!

517
00:22:08,827 --> 00:22:10,912
[grunting]

518
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:12,706
[Ron]
<i>But unfortunately for Buster...</i>

519
00:22:12,789 --> 00:22:16,543
-Return from whence... you came.
-[splashes]

520
00:22:16,626 --> 00:22:18,086
[Ron] <i>...he does so from</i>

521
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:20,547
<i>a long-thought-missing piece</i>
<i>of evidence.</i>

522
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:25,302
Hey, the stairs on our getaway truck
are pretty sticky.

523
00:22:25,385 --> 00:22:28,680
I wonder if there's, like,
a really tall car wash around here.

524
00:22:29,473 --> 00:22:33,226
[Oscar] Oh, yeah. I-- I noticed there's
a blood-like substance back there.

525
00:22:33,393 --> 00:22:36,313
But that's a tomorrow job.
That's for the daytime.
