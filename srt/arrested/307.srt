1
00:00:01,334 --> 00:00:02,543
narrator: NOW THE STORY

2
00:00:02,543 --> 00:00:04,254
OF A WEALTHY FAMILY 
WHO LOST EVERYTHING

3
00:00:04,254 --> 00:00:06,005
AND THE ONE SON 
WHO HAD NO CHOICE

4
00:00:06,005 --> 00:00:08,049
BUT TO KEEP THEM ALL TOGETHER.

5
00:00:13,721 --> 00:00:15,598
IT'S "ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT."

6
00:00:17,933 --> 00:00:21,020
MICHAEL BLUTH PAID AN 
UNEXPECTED VISIT TO HIS MOTHER.

7
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:22,063
- YOU LOOK PRETTY, MOM.

8
00:00:22,063 --> 00:00:23,231
- WHAT DO YOU NEED?

9
00:00:23,231 --> 00:00:24,982
- NEED? WHY DO YOU THINK 
I NEED SOMETHING?

10
00:00:24,982 --> 00:00:27,068
- WELL, YOU'RE TOO BUSY FOR US. 
NO ONE'S SEEN YOU.

11
00:00:27,068 --> 00:00:28,444
GOING ON ALL THOSE DATES 
WITH RITA.

12
00:00:28,444 --> 00:00:30,696
OR SHOULD I SAY PLAYDATES?

13
00:00:30,696 --> 00:00:32,865
- narrator: MICHAEL 
HAD RECENTLY DATED A WOMAN

14
00:00:32,865 --> 00:00:35,493
HE LATER FOUND OUT 
WAS MENTALLY CHALLENGED.

15
00:00:35,493 --> 00:00:37,037
- WE'RE NOT SEEING EACH OTHER 
ANYMORE,

16
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:38,246
BUT IT'S-- 
IT'S FOR THE BEST.

17
00:00:38,246 --> 00:00:40,040
I'M ACTUALLY 
KIND OF RELIEVED IT'S OVER.

18
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:42,250
narrator: ACTUALLY, 
MICHAEL HAD BEEN SO DEVASTATED

19
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:43,751
BY THEIR BREAK-UP

20
00:00:43,751 --> 00:00:45,461
THAT HE'D EVEN BROKEN OUT 
THE OLD GUITAR.

21
00:00:45,461 --> 00:00:50,758
- [singing] EYES, EYE--

22
00:00:50,758 --> 00:00:52,051
[clatters] 
[sighs]

23
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:57,348
- MAYBE YOU SHOULD TALK 
TO SOMEONE.

24
00:00:57,348 --> 00:00:58,391
- LIKE MY MOM?

25
00:00:58,391 --> 00:01:01,018
- I DON'T KNOW. 
DOES SHE PLAY GUITAR?

26
00:01:01,018 --> 00:01:02,562
- CAN'T A GUY 
CALL HIS MOM PRETTY

27
00:01:02,562 --> 00:01:03,896
WITHOUT IT SEEMING STRANGE?

28
00:01:03,896 --> 00:01:07,108
- AMEN. AND HOW ABOUT THAT 
LITTLE PIECE OF TAIL ON HER?

29
00:01:07,108 --> 00:01:08,068
CU-UTE!

30
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:09,902
- I'VE OPENED A DOOR HERE 
THAT I REGRET.

31
00:01:09,902 --> 00:01:12,488
- OH, HE'S JUST TALKING ABOUT 
HIS STUPID TURTLE.

32
00:01:12,488 --> 00:01:13,406
- OH.

33
00:01:13,406 --> 00:01:15,283
- SHE HAS A NAME, MOTHER. 
AND IT'S "MOTHER."

34
00:01:15,283 --> 00:01:17,743
narrator: BUSTER HAD RECENTLY 
BROUGHT HOME A TURTLE

35
00:01:17,743 --> 00:01:19,287
IN AN INCREDIBLY 
MISGUIDED ATTEMPT

36
00:01:19,287 --> 00:01:21,456
TO MAKE HIS MOTHER JEALOUS.

37
00:01:21,456 --> 00:01:25,710
- YOU CAN STAY IN THIS BOX THAT 
UNCLE-FATHER OSCAR LEFT BEHIND.

38
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:27,753
narrator: IN FACT, 
IT WAS A BOX OF OSCAR'S

39
00:01:27,753 --> 00:01:29,380
LEGALLY OBTAINED 
MEDICAL MARIJUANA.

40
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:30,965
- OH, GOOD. 
HEY, IT'S ALREADY GOT GRASS.

41
00:01:30,965 --> 00:01:32,758
narrator: PRIMO BUD. 
REAL STICKY WEED.

42
00:01:32,758 --> 00:01:34,552
- ALTHOUGH I WAS 
GETTING A LITTLE WORRIED

43
00:01:34,552 --> 00:01:36,429
BECAUSE SHE WAS MOVING 
REALLY SLOWLY LAST WEEK,

44
00:01:36,429 --> 00:01:39,765
AND THEN SHE STOPPED. 
HMM.

45
00:01:39,765 --> 00:01:41,434
- YEAH. WELL, IN ANY EVENT 
I'M HERE, MOM,

46
00:01:41,434 --> 00:01:42,768
BECAUSE YOU NEED ME.

47
00:01:42,768 --> 00:01:46,063
AS YOU KNOW THE BLUTH FOUNDATION 
DINNER IS A WEEK AWAY.

48
00:01:46,063 --> 00:01:47,148
I AM YOUR COCHAIR,

49
00:01:47,148 --> 00:01:50,276
AND WE DON'T WANNA RELIVE 
THE T.B.A. DEBACLE.

50
00:01:50,276 --> 00:01:53,028
narrator: YEARS EARLIER, 
THE BLUTHS HAD A HARD TIME

51
00:01:53,028 --> 00:01:57,074
AGREEING ON A CAUSE FOR THEIR 
FOUNDATION'S FIRST FUND-RAISER.

52
00:01:57,074 --> 00:02:00,120
- "HERPES." 
"SHRINKAGE."

53
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,579
SOMEBODY SAW "SEINFELD" 
LAST NIGHT.

54
00:02:01,579 --> 00:02:03,248
- [chuckles]

55
00:02:03,248 --> 00:02:06,167
- "NECK FLAP." 
"OVARIAN CANCER."

56
00:02:06,167 --> 00:02:08,878
GEE, I WONDER WHO THAT WAS?

57
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:10,671
ONE MORE FOR "NECK FLAP." 
- YES.

58
00:02:10,671 --> 00:02:11,797
- WELL, I'LL BE HONEST.

59
00:02:11,797 --> 00:02:13,549
I HAVEN'T HEARD ANYTHING 
THAT BEATS HERPES.

60
00:02:13,549 --> 00:02:15,968
narrator: SO THEY SENT OUT 
INVITATIONS WITH THE DISEASE

61
00:02:15,968 --> 00:02:17,970
STILL "TO BE ANNOUNCED."

62
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:19,264
AND MUCH TO THEIR SURPRISE,

63
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:25,478
THE BLUTHS ENDED UP RAISING 
OVER $25,000 TO FIGHT T.B.A.

64
00:02:25,478 --> 00:02:27,980
AND THEN--AND HERE'S 
THE REALLY HORRIBLE PART--

65
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:30,525
THEY DID IT AGAIN 
THE FOLLOWING YEAR.

66
00:02:30,525 --> 00:02:31,859
- KEEP FIGHTING, LITTLE GUY.

67
00:02:31,859 --> 00:02:34,069
WITH YOUR SUPPORT 
OF THE BLUTH FOUNDATION,

68
00:02:34,069 --> 00:02:38,283
WE'LL LIVE IN A GALAXY 
WHERE T.B.A. DOES NOT EXIST.

69
00:02:38,283 --> 00:02:40,075
- WHEN PEOPLE AT THE LAST GALA 
FOUND OUT,

70
00:02:40,075 --> 00:02:41,827
WE ALMOST HAD 
A RIOT ON OUR HANDS.

71
00:02:41,827 --> 00:02:43,163
- WELL, YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY

72
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:45,122
ABOUT ANYTHING LIKE THAT 
THIS YEAR,

73
00:02:45,122 --> 00:02:48,293
BECAUSE WARDEN GENTLES 
IS THE NEW COCHAIR.

74
00:02:48,293 --> 00:02:49,710
- THE GUY WHO RAN DAD'S PRISON?

75
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:51,754
- HE'S HERE NOW 
INSTALLING CAMERAS

76
00:02:51,754 --> 00:02:54,131
BECAUSE OF ALL YOUR FATHER'S 
ESCAPE ATTEMPTS.

77
00:02:54,131 --> 00:02:56,217
- UH, YEAH, LOOKS LIKE 
I WON'T BE GOIN' ANYWHERE

78
00:02:56,217 --> 00:02:57,218
FOR A LITTLE WHILE.

79
00:02:57,218 --> 00:02:58,386
BUT WHAT DO I CARE, HUH?

80
00:02:58,386 --> 00:02:59,554
I GOT A BEAUTIFUL WIFE.

81
00:02:59,554 --> 00:03:02,056
I GOT A WONDERFUL HOBBY. 
HA! LOOK AT ME.

82
00:03:02,056 --> 00:03:04,099
I'M HAVING THE TIME OF MY LIFE.

83
00:03:04,099 --> 00:03:07,061
narrator: HIS HOBBY WAS MAKING 
PAPIER-MACHE COPIES

84
00:03:07,061 --> 00:03:08,145
OF HIS OWN HEAD.

85
00:03:08,145 --> 00:03:11,148
- BEFORE I FORGET, DO YOU KNOW 
IF THESE CAMERAS ARE HIGH DEF?

86
00:03:11,148 --> 00:03:12,275
- I CERTAINLY HOPE SO.

87
00:03:12,275 --> 00:03:16,153
IT'LL HELP ME BETTER 
UNDERSTAND "GEORGE BLUTH,"

88
00:03:16,153 --> 00:03:18,573
THE MAIN CHARACTER OF THE LATEST 
AND, I PRAY, FINAL DRAFT

89
00:03:18,573 --> 00:03:22,201
OF MY SCREENPLAY, "NEW WARDEN."

90
00:03:22,201 --> 00:03:23,661
- YOU WROTE A SCREENPLAY, HUH?

91
00:03:23,661 --> 00:03:25,288
- I PROMISED MYSELF I WASN'T 
GONNA BECOME

92
00:03:25,288 --> 00:03:26,038
ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE

93
00:03:26,038 --> 00:03:28,040
WHO ARE ALWAYS GOING ON 
ABOUT THEIR SCREENPLAYS,

94
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,166
SO I'LL JUST SAY,

95
00:03:29,166 --> 00:03:33,128
I PUT TOGETHER A STAGED READING 
WITH SOME FABULOUS YOUNG ACTORS,

96
00:03:33,128 --> 00:03:35,172
AND IT WAS 
VERY WELL RECEIVED.

97
00:03:35,172 --> 00:03:36,382
narrator: WARDEN GENTLES

98
00:03:36,382 --> 00:03:37,883
HAD CONVINCED 
HIS GRANDDAUGHTER'S TEACHER

99
00:03:37,883 --> 00:03:40,761
TO MOUNT "NEW WARDEN" 
AS A SCHOOL PLAY.

100
00:03:40,761 --> 00:03:42,638
- I UNDERSTAND YOU'VE 
BEEN CAUSING PROBLEMS.

101
00:03:42,638 --> 00:03:44,139
NOBODY SELLS ANY COKE 
IN THIS PEN

102
00:03:44,139 --> 00:03:46,351
WITHOUT DADDY 
GETTING A TASTE.

103
00:03:46,351 --> 00:03:49,562
BEAT HIM WITH A PILLOWCASE 
FULL OF BATTERIES.

104
00:03:49,562 --> 00:03:51,564
- WARD'S LETTING US 
HOLD THE EVENT

105
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:53,649
IN THE NEW WING OF THE PRISON.

106
00:03:53,649 --> 00:03:57,653
AFTER LOCKDOWN, EVERYONE'S GOING 
TO SPEND THE NIGHT IN A CELL.

107
00:03:57,653 --> 00:04:00,615
[others laughing]

108
00:04:00,615 --> 00:04:02,575
- ARE THEY COLOR 
OR BLACK AND WHITE?

109
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:05,119
- SO, MICHAEL, I DON'T NEED 
YOUR HELP AT ALL--

110
00:04:05,119 --> 00:04:07,580
UNLESS YOU NEED SOMETHING 
FROM ME?

111
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:08,623
- NO. I'M FINE.

112
00:04:08,623 --> 00:04:10,916
JUST THOUGHT I COULD HELP. 
RELIEVED I DON'T HAVE TO.

113
00:04:12,668 --> 00:04:14,254
narrator: 
BUT HE WASN'T RELIEVED.

114
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:16,797
SO HE WENT HOME TO COMPLAIN 
TO HIS SISTER, LINDSAY.

115
00:04:16,797 --> 00:04:19,008
- PRISON'S THE LAST THING 
WE WANT PEOPLE ASSOCIATING

116
00:04:19,008 --> 00:04:19,759
WITH THE BLUTH NAME.

117
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:21,093
PLUS, WHO'S GONNA WANT TO GO?

118
00:04:21,093 --> 00:04:22,303
- WAIT, THIS IS GONNA BE 
AT THE PRISON?

119
00:04:22,303 --> 00:04:24,930
OH, GREAT. PROBABLY GONNA 
RUN INTO THAT WARDEN.

120
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:26,015
- HOW DO YOU KNOW THE WARDEN?

121
00:04:26,015 --> 00:04:27,475
- OH, RIGHT.

122
00:04:27,475 --> 00:04:30,144
UH, HE SPOKE AT MY SCHOOL FOR 
A "STARTLED STRAIGHT" ASSEMBLY.

123
00:04:30,144 --> 00:04:32,772
narrator: ACTUALLY, SHE'D MET 
WITH HIM IN THE HOPES

124
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:36,066
OF USING HIS PRISON 
AS A LOCATION FOR A FILM.

125
00:04:36,066 --> 00:04:37,443
- I THINK YOU WILL FIND 
THE DESSERT

126
00:04:37,443 --> 00:04:41,614
BOTH ENGROSSING 
AND HIGH GROSSING.

127
00:04:41,614 --> 00:04:43,741
- SO WE DON'T GET DESSERT.

128
00:04:43,741 --> 00:04:45,826
I GUESS I HAVE 
SOME READING TO DO.

129
00:04:45,826 --> 00:04:48,078
- BESIDES I DOUBT VERY MUCH 
MOM'S COME UP

130
00:04:48,078 --> 00:04:50,164
WITH A REAL DISEASE 
TO HAVE A FUND-RAISER FOR.

131
00:04:50,164 --> 00:04:51,541
- I FORGOT. 
WE HAVE A REAL DISEASE.

132
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:55,961
I CHOSE IT: G.V.H., 
"GRAFT VERSUS HOST."

133
00:04:55,961 --> 00:04:58,756
IT'S NEW, IT'S FATAL, 
AND GUESS WHO'S GOT IT?

134
00:04:58,756 --> 00:05:01,301
- YOU'VE HEARD OF BODIES 
REJECTING TRANSPLANTS.

135
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:02,385
WELL, IN THIS CASE,

136
00:05:02,385 --> 00:05:04,929
YOUR TRANSPLANTED HAIR 
IS REJECTING YOUR BODY.

137
00:05:04,929 --> 00:05:06,972
EITHER YOU REMOVE 
YOUR HAIR GRAFT,

138
00:05:06,972 --> 00:05:09,809
OR THE HOST, YOU, WILL GET 
SICKER AND EVENTUALLY DIE.

139
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:11,185
- CAN YOU THINK OF ANY BENEFITS?

140
00:05:11,185 --> 00:05:14,271
- BENEFITS? 
NO. HE'LL DIE.

141
00:05:14,271 --> 00:05:15,815
- OH, OH, YEAH. NO, I-- 
I GET THAT.

142
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:17,983
BUT HAVE THERE 
EVER BEEN ANY FUND-RAISERS?

143
00:05:17,983 --> 00:05:19,777
A HUSBAND 
WITH THE HEADLINING DISEASE.

144
00:05:19,777 --> 00:05:22,655
EVERYONE'S GONNA 
WANNA TALK TO ME.

145
00:05:22,655 --> 00:05:24,156
- YOU'RE MAKING HIM 
KEEP THE HAIR?

146
00:05:24,156 --> 00:05:26,451
- DID YOU SEE THE ATTENTION 
SUPERMAN'S WIFE GOT?

147
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:27,827
BESIDES, TOBIAS WANTS IT TOO.

148
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:28,911
- OH, SHE'S RIGHT.

149
00:05:28,911 --> 00:05:31,664
THIS IS GONNA BE GREAT FOR 
ME, BECAUSE I AM GONNA STAR

150
00:05:31,664 --> 00:05:33,833
IN THE VIDEO GOB'S MAKING 
FOR THE GALA.

151
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:36,502
- OH, YEAH. 
IT'LL BE VERY UPLIFTING.

152
00:05:36,502 --> 00:05:37,795
OH, HERE, LET ME 
GET THAT FOR YOU.

153
00:05:37,795 --> 00:05:38,963
- THANK YOU.

154
00:05:38,963 --> 00:05:41,006
OH. OH, THIS IS GONNA HURT. 
OH!

155
00:05:41,006 --> 00:05:42,550
crash!

156
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:43,843
thud! 
OOP.

157
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:46,303
- YOU KNOW WHAT? WE'RE GONNA 
NEED THIS FROM ANOTHER ANGLE.

158
00:05:46,303 --> 00:05:47,763
- AND YOU'RE SURE 
YOU'RE OKAY?

159
00:05:47,763 --> 00:05:48,973
- OH, PROBABLY.

160
00:05:48,973 --> 00:05:51,476
I CAN'T FEEL ANYTHING. 
HOW'S MY HAIR?

161
00:05:51,476 --> 00:05:52,435
- IT'S FINE.

162
00:05:52,435 --> 00:05:54,437
IT'S SUCKING THE LIFE 
OUT OF YOU, TOBIAS.

163
00:05:54,437 --> 00:05:56,021
I MEAN, EVERYTHING'S GONE 
CRAZY--

164
00:05:56,021 --> 00:05:57,690
THE GALA, 
MOM AND WARDEN GENTLES.

165
00:05:57,690 --> 00:05:58,733
I MEAN, WHAT IS IN IT FOR HIM?

166
00:05:58,733 --> 00:06:00,234
I THINK HE'S TAKING 
ADVANTAGE OF MOM.

167
00:06:00,234 --> 00:06:01,444
- AND DID IT EVER OCCUR TO YOU

168
00:06:01,444 --> 00:06:03,278
THAT MAYBE WARDEN GENTLES 
LIKES HER?

169
00:06:03,278 --> 00:06:04,321
- LIKES HER WHAT?

170
00:06:04,321 --> 00:06:08,200
- NO, I--I MEAN, LIKES HER, 
LIKE, IS ATTRACTED TO HER.

171
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,785
- WHO'S THE "HER" 
IN THAT SENTENCE?

172
00:06:09,785 --> 00:06:12,204
- MOM. WARDEN GENTLES LIKES MOM.

173
00:06:12,204 --> 00:06:13,080
- HER?

174
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:15,332
- I'M AFRAID 
I'M WITH MICHAEL ON THIS.

175
00:06:15,332 --> 00:06:16,375
THE GUY RUNS A PRISON.

176
00:06:16,375 --> 00:06:18,210
HE CAN HAVE ANY PIECE 
OF ASS HE WANTS.

177
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:21,213
- AND IF HE LIKES HER IN THAT 
SENSE, IT MAKES IT EVEN WORSE.

178
00:06:21,213 --> 00:06:23,173
I DON'T WANT MOM MIXED UP 
WITH THE SORT OF CREEP

179
00:06:23,173 --> 00:06:24,341
THAT WOULD HAVE HER AS A FETISH.

180
00:06:24,341 --> 00:06:25,384
- OH, MICHAEL,

181
00:06:25,384 --> 00:06:27,261
YOU'RE JUST FEELING NEGLECTED 
BY YOUR MOTHER.

182
00:06:27,261 --> 00:06:29,221
YOU WANTED TO GO TO THIS 
WITH HER, DIDN'T YOU?

183
00:06:29,221 --> 00:06:31,641
- HEY, I--I DON'T NEED 
TO TAKE MY MOM TO A GALA, OKAY?

184
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:33,809
ONLY LOSERS GO TO THOSE 
THINGS WITH THEIR PARENTS.

185
00:06:33,809 --> 00:06:34,644
I'M GOING WITH MY SON.

186
00:06:34,644 --> 00:06:36,228
- OH, I MAY SKIP THAT. 
I DON'T LIKE GALAS.

187
00:06:36,228 --> 00:06:38,063
narrator: 
ACTUALLY, HE LOVED GALAS.

188
00:06:38,063 --> 00:06:39,398
ALL KIDS DO.

189
00:06:39,398 --> 00:06:42,443
- OH, COME ON. DON'T LEAVE 
YOUR UNCLE TEA BAG HANGIN'.

190
00:06:42,443 --> 00:06:43,861
- PLEASE DON'T 
CALL YOURSELF THAT.

191
00:06:43,861 --> 00:06:45,571
narrator: WHAT HE WAS HAVING 
TROUBLE WITH

192
00:06:45,571 --> 00:06:47,197
WAS LOOKING DIRECTLY 
AT HIS DYING UNCLE.

193
00:06:47,197 --> 00:06:48,949
- I CAN'T STAND BY 
AND WATCH MOM GET HURT.

194
00:06:48,949 --> 00:06:51,827
I GOTTA GET DOWN THERE.

195
00:06:51,827 --> 00:06:52,995
- THIS IS HEARTBREAKING.

196
00:06:52,995 --> 00:06:55,498
GOTTA GET THIS 
FOR THE VIDEO.

197
00:06:55,498 --> 00:06:56,499
HEY, GEORGE MICHAEL,

198
00:06:56,499 --> 00:06:58,876
YOU WANNA PUT YOUR HEAD DOWN 
THERE BY HIS DRAINAGE SHUNT?

199
00:06:58,876 --> 00:07:00,335
narrator: BUSTER, MEANWHILE,

200
00:07:00,335 --> 00:07:03,172
WAS ALSO FEELING ABANDONED 
BY MOTHER.

201
00:07:03,172 --> 00:07:07,384
- MO--MOTHER! 
I HAVE NO ONE NOW.

202
00:07:07,384 --> 00:07:08,969
narrator: 
BUT AT THAT VERY MOMENT,

203
00:07:08,969 --> 00:07:11,556
HIS TRUE FATHER RETURNED.

204
00:07:11,556 --> 00:07:12,515
- [gasps]

205
00:07:12,515 --> 00:07:14,642
UNCLE-FATHER OSCAR, 
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

206
00:07:14,642 --> 00:07:16,686
- [sighs] 
WELL, YOU KNOW ME.

207
00:07:16,686 --> 00:07:19,647
I COULD NEVER 
LEAVE A LITTLE BUD BEHIND.

208
00:07:19,647 --> 00:07:20,690
OH, A HUG. NICE.

209
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:24,819
YOU HAVEN'T SEEN A LITTLE BOX 
WITH A TURTLE ON IT, HAVE YOU?

210
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:26,446
- OH, YEAH. MY TURTLE 
WAS LIVING IN IT

211
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:28,363
BEFORE HE ATE ALL THE GRASS 
AND DIED.

212
00:07:28,363 --> 00:07:30,783
- HE ATE ALL THE GRASS? 
- YEAH.

213
00:07:30,783 --> 00:07:32,201
- WELL, IT'S BEEN GREAT 
CATCHING UP.

214
00:07:32,201 --> 00:07:33,327
- W-W-WAIT, WHERE YOU GOING?

215
00:07:33,327 --> 00:07:34,078
- NO, I CAN'T STAY,

216
00:07:34,078 --> 00:07:36,121
BECAUSE IF MY BROTHER FINDS OUT 
THAT I'M HERE,

217
00:07:36,121 --> 00:07:37,832
HE'S GONNA TRY SWITCHING 
PLACES AGAIN,

218
00:07:37,832 --> 00:07:39,416
AND I CAN'T 
GO BACK TO PRISON.

219
00:07:39,416 --> 00:07:40,292
- WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

220
00:07:40,292 --> 00:07:42,336
IF MY FATHER COMES IN, YOU CAN 
HIDE IN ONE OF GOB'S TRICKS.

221
00:07:42,336 --> 00:07:43,128
- I CAN'T.

222
00:07:43,128 --> 00:07:45,339
- AT LEAST YOU CAN STAY AND 
HELP ME BURY MY POOR TURTLE.

223
00:07:45,339 --> 00:07:47,467
- OR WE COULD CREMATE IT.

224
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:49,384
narrator: AND MAEBY 
WAS HAVING A HARDER TIME

225
00:07:49,384 --> 00:07:51,721
FINISHING WARDEN GENTLE'S 
SCREENPLAY THAN HE DID.

226
00:07:51,721 --> 00:07:52,805
- YOU'RE A READER.

227
00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:54,557
HOW'D YOU LIKE 
TO READ SOMETHING FUN

228
00:07:54,557 --> 00:07:57,017
THAT WE COULD TALK ABOUT 
ON THE WAY TO THE PRISON GALA?

229
00:07:57,017 --> 00:07:58,686
- OH, I'M ACTUALLY GONNA 
SIT THAT OUT.

230
00:07:58,686 --> 00:08:00,938
I'M JUST BURNT OUT 
ON PRISONS LATELY.

231
00:08:00,938 --> 00:08:02,523
- WELL, THIS MIGHT 
CHANGE YOUR MIND.

232
00:08:02,523 --> 00:08:03,608
- IS THAT A SCREENPLAY?

233
00:08:03,608 --> 00:08:05,860
- WELL, THAT'S WHAT 
YOU'RE GONNA TELL ME.

234
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:07,862
narrator: AND MICHAEL RACED 
TO WARN HIS MOTHER

235
00:08:07,862 --> 00:08:08,904
OF THE WARDEN'S INTENTIONS.

236
00:08:08,904 --> 00:08:10,865
- HEY! YOU CAN'T PARK THERE. 
- OH, SORRY.

237
00:08:10,865 --> 00:08:11,741
I'M SORRY.

238
00:08:11,741 --> 00:08:13,450
- NO STAIRS. 
NO PARKING.

239
00:08:13,450 --> 00:08:14,118
- [screams]

240
00:08:14,118 --> 00:08:16,704
- SORRY.

241
00:08:18,247 --> 00:08:20,207
- EVERYTHING LOOKS DELICIOUS.

242
00:08:20,207 --> 00:08:22,710
- OH, ONE-EYE'S 
A WONDERFUL CHEF.

243
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:24,587
I'VE HAD TO GO TO HIS PAROLE 
HEARINGS TWICE

244
00:08:24,587 --> 00:08:27,256
AND LIE THROUGH 
MY TEETH TO KEEP HIM HERE.

245
00:08:27,256 --> 00:08:28,423
- [cackling]

246
00:08:28,423 --> 00:08:30,926
- HI, I JUST, UM--

247
00:08:30,926 --> 00:08:33,470
WOW. 
WHAT ARE YOU GUYS DOING?

248
00:08:33,470 --> 00:08:35,472
- IT'S PERFECTLY INNOCENT,

249
00:08:35,472 --> 00:08:37,975
BUT I CAN SEE HOW 
IF OUR ROLES WERE REVERSED,

250
00:08:37,975 --> 00:08:39,101
I MIGHT HAVE YOU BEATEN

251
00:08:39,101 --> 00:08:41,687
WITH A PILLOWCASE 
FULL OF BATTERIES.

252
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:43,648
I'LL GIVE YOU TWO A MOMENT. 
- THANK YOU.

253
00:08:43,648 --> 00:08:45,107
- I DON'T KNOW WHY 
I ALWAYS ASSUME

254
00:08:45,107 --> 00:08:46,859
THAT EVERYONE'S READ 
MY SCREENPLAY.

255
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:48,027
- WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?

256
00:08:48,027 --> 00:08:50,320
THAT MAN IS BEING 
WONDERFUL TO US.

257
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,989
- AND THAT DOESN'T CONCERN YOU, 
MOTHER?

258
00:08:51,989 --> 00:08:53,949
FOR ALL YOU KNOW, HE COULD BE 
TRYING TO SEDUCE YOU.

259
00:08:53,949 --> 00:08:56,410
- OH, MICHAEL, YOU'RE CRAZY. 
- I CERTAINLY HOPE SO.

260
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:59,454
- I'M TRYING TO SEDUCE HIM.

261
00:08:59,454 --> 00:09:00,873
- WHO'S THE "I" IN THAT 
SENTENCE?

262
00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:02,833
- ME. 
- YOU?

263
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:04,501
- narrator: HER.

264
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:11,926
MICHAEL HAD JUST DISCOVERED

265
00:09:11,926 --> 00:09:14,679
THAT HIS MOTHER WAS INTERESTED 
IN ANOTHER MAN.

266
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:16,847
- MOM WANTS TO SLEEP 
WITH THE WARDEN.

267
00:09:16,847 --> 00:09:19,099
- WHAT? OH, GOD!

268
00:09:19,099 --> 00:09:20,100
- GREAT.

269
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:21,226
- GREAT? THE MAN IS OLD ENOUGH

270
00:09:21,226 --> 00:09:22,562
TO BE HER CONTEMPORARY, 
LINDSAY.

271
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:23,771
PLUS, SHE'S MARRIED, OKAY?

272
00:09:23,771 --> 00:09:25,940
SHE CAN'T BE WRITHING AROUND 
UNDERNEATH THE COVERS--

273
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:27,107
- WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?

274
00:09:27,107 --> 00:09:29,401
IT'S DISGUSTING! GOD! 
- TAKE IT EASY.

275
00:09:29,401 --> 00:09:31,111
- NO, IT'S JUST I'VE ALWAYS 
HAD A THING

276
00:09:31,111 --> 00:09:32,279
ABOUT MOM AND DAD 
BEING TOGETHER.

277
00:09:32,279 --> 00:09:33,238
- I KNOW THAT.

278
00:09:33,238 --> 00:09:34,949
- I HAVE A SENSE 
OF PROPRIETY, MY GOD.

279
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:36,241
- GOB, WE'VE HAD 
THIS CONVERSATION.

280
00:09:36,241 --> 00:09:37,159
- WHEN?

281
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:39,328
- THE LAST TIME YOU ENDED UP 
SEEING MOM AND DAD GO AT IT.

282
00:09:39,328 --> 00:09:40,621
- WHAT? NO! GOD, MICHAEL!

283
00:09:40,621 --> 00:09:41,664
I DID NO SUCH THING.

284
00:09:41,664 --> 00:09:44,124
- narrator: 
HE DID VERY MUCH THAT THING

285
00:09:44,124 --> 00:09:45,500
WHEN HIS PARENTS GOT INTIMATE

286
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:47,878
IN A CONJUGAL TRAILER 
TWO YEARS AGO.

287
00:09:47,878 --> 00:09:49,964
BUT THANKFULLY, HE'D FOUND 
A WAY TO FORGET THAT.

288
00:09:49,964 --> 00:09:51,548
- I GOT A THING OF PILLS 
IN MY POCKET.

289
00:09:51,548 --> 00:09:54,760
I DON'T SUPPOSE I COULD 
CONVINCE YOU TO GRAB ME ONE.

290
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,386
narrator: 
LUCKILY, THAT WORKED TOO.

291
00:09:56,386 --> 00:09:58,055
- I CAN'T EVEN HEAR THIS.

292
00:09:58,055 --> 00:10:00,224
- YOU MAY NOT LIKE IT 
THAT MOM HAS NEEDS,

293
00:10:00,224 --> 00:10:02,434
BUT IT NEVER BOTHERED YOU 
WHEN DAD WAS RUNNING AROUND.

294
00:10:02,434 --> 00:10:03,811
- WELL, THAT WAS DIFFERENT.

295
00:10:03,811 --> 00:10:05,980
- WELL, HOW 'BOUT WHEN SHE WAS 
SLEEPING WITH UNCLE OSCAR?

296
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:07,982
- THE GUY LOOKS JUST LIKE DAD.

297
00:10:07,982 --> 00:10:09,233
I DON'T KNOW. HE'S FAMILY.

298
00:10:09,233 --> 00:10:11,110
IT SEEMED VERY NATURAL 
THEY'D BE TOGETHER.

299
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:12,444
- WHO? WHAT? WHAT IS NATURAL?

300
00:10:12,444 --> 00:10:14,071
IS THERE NEW LEGISLATION 
ON THIS NOW?

301
00:10:14,071 --> 00:10:16,490
narrator: GEORGE MICHAEL 
WAS CONCERNED ABOUT FAMILY LOVE

302
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:18,075
AFTER READING MAEBY'S SCRIPT,

303
00:10:18,075 --> 00:10:20,327
WHICH HE TOOK AS A SUBTLE 
MESSAGE TO HIM FROM HIS COUSIN.

304
00:10:20,327 --> 00:10:22,913
- LISTEN, NEW FISH.

305
00:10:22,913 --> 00:10:24,999
THAT BUNK WAS OPEN 
BECAUSE THE LAST GUY

306
00:10:24,999 --> 00:10:27,417
WOULDN'T DO THE THINGS 
THAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO.

307
00:10:27,417 --> 00:10:28,711
- WE'RE GOING TO DO THINGS?

308
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:32,589
- ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN WHEN 
TWO PEOPLE SHARE A CELL, COZ.

309
00:10:32,589 --> 00:10:35,676
- UM, I'LL GO--OKAY, I'LL GO 
WITH YOU TO THE PRISON.

310
00:10:35,676 --> 00:10:37,887
- GEORGE MICHAEL, WHAT I WANT 
YOU TO DO IS RUN UPSTAIRS

311
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:40,597
AND RUN A NICE BATH 
FOR UNCLE TOBIAS.

312
00:10:40,597 --> 00:10:42,307
AND I WANT YOU TO HELP HIM 
GET IN THE TUB.

313
00:10:42,307 --> 00:10:43,726
CAN YOU DO THAT FOR ME? 
THANKS.

314
00:10:43,726 --> 00:10:45,269
- AND DON'T MAKE 
THE WATER TOO HOT.

315
00:10:45,269 --> 00:10:46,603
THE SCABS COME RIGHT OFF.

316
00:10:46,603 --> 00:10:48,773
- COME ON, LINDSAY. WHAT ARE 
WE GONNA DO ABOUT MOTHER?

317
00:10:48,773 --> 00:10:49,439
- HONESTLY, MICHAEL,

318
00:10:49,439 --> 00:10:50,650
ALL THIS "MOTHER" TALK--

319
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:53,527
YOU'RE STARTING TO SOUND 
A LOT LIKE BUSTER.

320
00:10:53,527 --> 00:10:55,863
narrator: AND MICHAEL REALIZED 
THERE WAS SOMEBODY ELSE

321
00:10:55,863 --> 00:10:57,907
IN THE FAMILY 
WHO WOULD CARE ABOUT THIS.

322
00:10:57,907 --> 00:10:59,533
- BUSTER'S GONNA TAKE THIS 
SO HARD.

323
00:10:59,533 --> 00:11:01,410
I CANNOT LET 
MY BROTHER GET HURT.

324
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:03,453
- OH!

325
00:11:03,453 --> 00:11:05,831
[grunting]

326
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:12,212
- OH, IT'S ON STANDBY.

327
00:11:12,212 --> 00:11:13,422
GOT ANOTHER ONE IN YOU?

328
00:11:13,422 --> 00:11:14,673
- [groaning]

329
00:11:14,673 --> 00:11:17,509
narrator: BUSTER, MEANWHILE, 
WAS ENJOYING BEING WITH OSCAR.

330
00:11:17,509 --> 00:11:20,054
BUT OSCAR WAS LONGING 
FOR HIS SWEET FREEDOM.

331
00:11:20,054 --> 00:11:23,223
- SAY, YOU DON'T HAVE ANY 
SWEET FREEDOM OR TROPICAL EASE

332
00:11:23,223 --> 00:11:25,475
OR ANY OF THE HAWAIIAN BLENDS, 
DO YOU?

333
00:11:25,475 --> 00:11:27,895
[door closes] 
SOMEONE'S COMING.

334
00:11:27,895 --> 00:11:29,980
- OH, DAD, GET IN THE CAGE 
AND HIDE BEHIND THE MIRROR.

335
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:31,190
IT'LL LOOK EMPTY.

336
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:34,777
narrator: OSCAR 
NEVER GOT A CHANCE

337
00:11:34,777 --> 00:11:35,986
TO HIDE BEHIND THE MIRROR.

338
00:11:35,986 --> 00:11:36,904
- [grunts]

339
00:11:36,904 --> 00:11:38,655
narrator: ALTHOUGH IT WAS NOT 
THE FIRST TIME

340
00:11:38,655 --> 00:11:40,866
HE WAS KNOCKED OUT 
BY A POWERFUL LID.

341
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:42,785
- HEY, BUSTER, LISTEN.

342
00:11:42,785 --> 00:11:45,370
I GOT SOME BAD NEWS 
ABOUT MOM.

343
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:48,373
SHE'S PLANNING ON SPENDING THE 
NIGHT WITH ANOTHER MAN.

344
00:11:48,373 --> 00:11:49,166
- GOB?

345
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:50,876
- N-NO. NOT ANOTHER BROTHER.

346
00:11:50,876 --> 00:11:52,044
- OH. 
THEN WHY DO WE CARE?

347
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:54,088
- WHAT IS WRONG WITH EVERYONE?

348
00:11:54,088 --> 00:11:56,215
UH, B-BUSTER, YOU'VE GOT 
TO TALK TO MOM ABOUT THIS.

349
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:57,466
SHE CAN'T POSSIBLY DO IT.

350
00:11:57,466 --> 00:11:59,009
IF DAD FINDS OUT, 
HE'LL GO BERSERK.

351
00:11:59,009 --> 00:12:00,677
- IF DAD FINDS OUT ABOUT WHAT?

352
00:12:00,677 --> 00:12:02,429
- OH. WELL, I GUESS 
I'VE GOT NO CHOICE NOW.

353
00:12:02,429 --> 00:12:04,181
DAD, I-I'VE GOT SOME BAD NEWS

354
00:12:04,181 --> 00:12:09,019
ABOUT MOM 
AND WARDEN GENTLES DATING.

355
00:12:09,019 --> 00:12:11,939
- OH. BETTER SIT DOWN.

356
00:12:11,939 --> 00:12:15,317
[breathing heavily] 
OKAY, WHAT'S THE NEWS?

357
00:12:15,317 --> 00:12:16,360
- THEY'RE DATING.

358
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:18,988
- OH, YEAH. BECAUSE SHE'S-- 
SHE'S MY WIFE.

359
00:12:18,988 --> 00:12:20,030
OH, YEAH. DAMN IT!

360
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:21,698
- I'M SURPRISED YOU'RE NOT 
MORE UPSET ABOUT THIS.

361
00:12:21,698 --> 00:12:24,201
- WHEN YOU FIRST TOLD ME, BUT 
YOU SEE, TIME--TIME PASSES.

362
00:12:24,201 --> 00:12:26,161
BESIDES, IT'S ONLY, 
UH, DINNER IN THE OFFICE.

363
00:12:26,161 --> 00:12:27,496
I MEAN IT'S NOT LE CIRQUE.

364
00:12:27,496 --> 00:12:29,206
- HOW'D YOU KNOW 
THAT IT WAS IN HIS OFFICE?

365
00:12:29,206 --> 00:12:30,958
- WELL, WH-WHERE-- 
WHERE THE HELL ELSE

366
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:33,836
ARE THEY GONNA GO 
AT 4:00 IN THE AFTERNOON?

367
00:12:33,836 --> 00:12:35,754
- IT WAS AROUND 4:00. 
YOU ALREADY KNOW ABOUT THIS.

368
00:12:35,754 --> 00:12:37,339
COME ON. 
YOU'RE UP TO SOMETHING, RIGHT?

369
00:12:37,339 --> 00:12:38,340
- NO. 
- YOU BOTH ARE.

370
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:40,634
SHE'S WORKIN' THE WARDEN. 
YOU'RE MAKIN' FAKE HEADS.

371
00:12:40,634 --> 00:12:41,718
YOU'RE PLANNING AN ESCAPE.

372
00:12:41,718 --> 00:12:43,053
- HOW DARE YOU?

373
00:12:43,053 --> 00:12:44,263
I OUGHTA SHAVE YOUR HEAD

374
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:46,223
AND MAKE YOU SIT UNDER 
THAT CAMERA ALL NIGHT, MISTER.

375
00:12:46,223 --> 00:12:47,724
- IT'S UNBELIEVABLE. YOU KNOW,

376
00:12:47,724 --> 00:12:50,352
I WAS WORRIED THAT THIS GUY 
WAS GONNA TAKE ADVANTAGE OF MOM.

377
00:12:50,352 --> 00:12:52,104
YOU BOTH WERE TAKING ADVANTAGE 
OF HIM.

378
00:12:52,104 --> 00:12:53,647
I DON'T KNOW WHY I WORK 
SO DAMN HARD

379
00:12:53,647 --> 00:12:55,357
TO KEEP THIS FAMILY TOGETHER.

380
00:12:55,357 --> 00:12:57,234
- MICHAEL, CAN I TALK TO YOU 
FOR ONE SEC?

381
00:12:57,234 --> 00:12:59,736
narrator: AND THAT'S WHEN GEORGE 
SR. GOT A CALL FROM LUCILLE.

382
00:12:59,736 --> 00:13:02,197
- THREE, TWO, TWO, FIVE, TWO.

383
00:13:03,448 --> 00:13:05,826
[beeps] 
- HOWDY DOODY, THAT'S IT.

384
00:13:05,826 --> 00:13:08,537
NOW, Y-YOU GET BACK HERE 
SO YOU CAN SMUGGLE ME OUT

385
00:13:08,537 --> 00:13:10,622
PAST THE GUARDS 
BEFORE MICHAEL STARTS BLABBING.

386
00:13:10,622 --> 00:13:13,042
- YOU KNOW WHAT? 
YOU CAN SMUGGLE YOURSELF OUT.

387
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:15,335
YOU WANNA GET AWAY FROM ME 
SO BAD? YOU'RE FREE.

388
00:13:15,335 --> 00:13:17,712
BUT I'M FREE TOO, BABY.

389
00:13:17,712 --> 00:13:21,300
I'M STAYING IN THE CONJUGAL 
TRAILER WITH THE WARDEN TONIGHT.

390
00:13:23,093 --> 00:13:25,095
- HIM?

391
00:13:25,095 --> 00:13:26,972
- HEY, WHY IS THERE 
AN AMBULANCE OUT FRONT?

392
00:13:26,972 --> 00:13:29,558
- HONEY, THE CAR IS HERE.

393
00:13:29,558 --> 00:13:30,725
- HEY, DO YOU NEED A RIDE?

394
00:13:30,725 --> 00:13:32,477
I MEAN, YOU'LL HAVE TO 
LIE DOWN, BUT--

395
00:13:32,477 --> 00:13:34,271
- I'M NOT GOIN'. 
THE WHOLE THING IS A SCAM.

396
00:13:34,271 --> 00:13:36,481
MOM WAS USING THAT WARDEN 
TO TRY TO GET DAD OUT.

397
00:13:36,481 --> 00:13:38,025
SHE'S NOT TRYING 
TO SEDUCE HIM AT ALL.

398
00:13:38,025 --> 00:13:39,276
- OH, NO. SHE IS.

399
00:13:39,276 --> 00:13:40,903
SHE'S SPENDING THE NIGHT 
WITH HIM.

400
00:13:40,903 --> 00:13:43,238
SHE JUST CALLED TO ASK ME TO 
BRING HER A TUBE OF VAG--

401
00:13:43,238 --> 00:13:45,032
IS-TABLE PASTE.

402
00:13:45,032 --> 00:13:46,325
HI, GEORGE MICHAEL.

403
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:47,534
- YOU'RE GOIN' TOO, HUH?

404
00:13:47,534 --> 00:13:49,786
- YEAH. I THOUGHT I WOULD, UM, 
JUST GO WITH MAEBY

405
00:13:49,786 --> 00:13:52,706
AND SUPPORT HER THROUGH THIS 
WHOLE GRAFT VERSUS HOST THING.

406
00:13:52,706 --> 00:13:55,792
narrator: AND MICHAEL HIMSELF 
WAS FEELING A LITTLE LIKE

407
00:13:55,792 --> 00:13:58,503
THE HOST THAT THE GRAFTING 
FAMILY WAS REJECTING.

408
00:13:58,503 --> 00:13:59,588
- GOOD. GREAT. GO.

409
00:13:59,588 --> 00:14:00,965
IT'S A VERY IMPORTANT CAUSE.

410
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:03,926
I'LL JUST STAY HERE AND READ.

411
00:14:03,926 --> 00:14:06,345
narrator: BUT THIS, TOO, 
WOULD PROVE CHALLENGING

412
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:08,263
AS THE FAMILY HAD NO BOOKS.

413
00:14:11,558 --> 00:14:13,352
OTHER THAN THOSE.

414
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:15,395
AND THAT'S WHEN MICHAEL 
GOT A GLIMPSE

415
00:14:15,395 --> 00:14:18,773
INTO THE WARDEN'S TRUE 
INTENTIONS WITH HIS MOTHER.

416
00:14:18,773 --> 00:14:19,942
- YOU WERE JUST USING ME

417
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:23,320
TO GET EVEN WITH THE MAN 
WHO BROKE OUT OF YOUR PRISON?

418
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:25,447
- THAT ESCAPE COST ME 
MY PROMOTION.

419
00:14:25,447 --> 00:14:29,534
AND YOU WILL PAY FOR 
THE LOSS OF $2,300 A YEAR.

420
00:14:29,534 --> 00:14:32,579
- BUT YOU GAVE ME PRESENTS. 
WE MADE LOVE.

421
00:14:32,579 --> 00:14:34,081
- I'VE GIVEN YOU 
ONE LAST PRESENT.

422
00:14:34,081 --> 00:14:36,541
ENJOY THE CHLAMYDIA, LUCILLE.

423
00:14:36,541 --> 00:14:38,543
HA, HA, HA.

424
00:14:38,543 --> 00:14:42,172
TAKE THIS NEWLY DISEASED WOMAN 
TO THE HOLE. HA, HA, HA.

425
00:14:42,172 --> 00:14:44,841
- I WISH I'D READ 
"THE MAN INSIDE ME."

426
00:14:50,514 --> 00:14:52,641
narrator: 
GEORGE SR. NEEDED TO ESCAPE,

427
00:14:52,641 --> 00:14:56,645
BUT HIS HANDMADE REPLICA 
WOULD NEVER FOOL THE CAMERAS.

428
00:14:56,645 --> 00:14:58,438
SO HE SEARCHED 
THROUGH GOB'S MAGIC STUFF

429
00:14:58,438 --> 00:15:01,358
TO FIND SOMETHING THAT MIGHT.

430
00:15:01,358 --> 00:15:03,360
- WELL, THAT WAS A FREEBIE.

431
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,736
- HEY, GOB, 
I'M GLAD YOU'RE HERE.

432
00:15:04,736 --> 00:15:06,030
I THOUGHT YOU'D BE AT THE GALA.

433
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:08,532
- YEAH, DAD MADE ME MOVE MY 
STUFF OUTTA BUSTER'S ROOM.

434
00:15:08,532 --> 00:15:11,368
narrator: BUT ONLY AFTER 
HIDING HIMSELF IN THE CAGE

435
00:15:11,368 --> 00:15:13,870
TO GET PAST THE COPS 
AT THE DOOR.

436
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:14,829
- GO.

437
00:15:14,829 --> 00:15:17,249
- MOM'S BEING SET UP. WE HAVE 
TO GET INTO THAT PRISON.

438
00:15:17,249 --> 00:15:18,417
- IT'S AFTER LOCKDOWN.

439
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:20,252
- COME ON, GOB. YOU WERE GONNA 
BREAK OUT OF THIS PLACE ONCE.

440
00:15:20,252 --> 00:15:21,670
I KNOW YOU CAN HELP ME BREAK IN.

441
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:23,797
- [scoffs] 
IT'S NOT A JAMBA JUICE, MICHAEL.

442
00:15:23,797 --> 00:15:26,050
IT SHOULDN'T BE THAT HARD 
TO BREAK INTO.

443
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:27,509
narrator: AND BUSTER RETURNED

444
00:15:27,509 --> 00:15:31,263
ONLY TO FIND 
NO EVIDENCE OF HIS UNCLE-FATHER.

445
00:15:31,263 --> 00:15:33,432
- [mumbles] 
- HEY, FATHER-UNCLE DAD,

446
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:35,434
I WAS JUST BRINGIN' 
SOME JUICE FOR MY PET.

447
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:38,895
WAIT A MINUTE. 
YOU'RE NOT REALLY SMILING.

448
00:15:38,895 --> 00:15:41,523
- I'M OSCAR. 
HE DID IT AGAIN.

449
00:15:41,523 --> 00:15:42,566
I TOLD YOU HE WOULD.

450
00:15:42,566 --> 00:15:46,403
I CAN'T GO THROUGH THIS AGAIN. 
I CAN'T BE CAGED!

451
00:15:46,403 --> 00:15:47,862
narrator: AND BUSTER REALIZED

452
00:15:47,862 --> 00:15:51,783
HE NEEDED TO GIVE HIS TRUE 
FATHER HIS FREEDOM.

453
00:15:51,783 --> 00:15:52,867
- HEY! LET'S GET HIM!

454
00:15:52,867 --> 00:15:55,704
narrator: BUT IT WAS A FREEDOM 
THAT DIDN'T LAST LONG.

455
00:15:55,704 --> 00:15:58,415
AND AS THE PRISON GALA 
WAS UNDERWAY,

456
00:15:58,415 --> 00:16:01,418
THE GUYS ARRIVED FOR THEIR 
BREAK-IN, WITH THE HELP

457
00:16:01,418 --> 00:16:04,046
OF ONE OF GEORGE SR.'S 
INSTRUMENTS OF ESCAPE.

458
00:16:04,046 --> 00:16:05,464
- YOU THINK THIS IS GONNA WORK?

459
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:08,092
- IT'S A JET PACK, MICHAEL. 
WHAT COULD POSSIBLY GO WRONG?

460
00:16:08,092 --> 00:16:09,093
ALL RIGHT.

461
00:16:09,093 --> 00:16:11,886
- NOW JUST MAKE SURE YOU TELL ME 
BEFORE YOU HIT ANY BUTTONS--

462
00:16:15,390 --> 00:16:17,267
- GOOD. NOW WE KNOW 
WHAT THE STRAP IS FOR.

463
00:16:17,267 --> 00:16:19,103
- OKAY. 
- UNDER THE CROTCH.

464
00:16:19,103 --> 00:16:20,104
- WE NEED A NEW PLAN. 
- YUP.

465
00:16:20,104 --> 00:16:21,563
- WISH I KNEW THE LAYOUT 
OF THIS PLACE.

466
00:16:21,563 --> 00:16:24,483
- WAY AHEAD OF YOU, MICHAEL.

467
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:25,859
DREW A MAP OF IT ON MY STOMACH.

468
00:16:25,859 --> 00:16:28,237
IT'S UPSIDE DOWN, SO IT MIGHT 
BE A LITTLE AWKWARD.

469
00:16:28,237 --> 00:16:29,279
narrator: IT WAS AWKWARD.

470
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:30,489
- I DREW US.

471
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:31,781
I THINK WE'RE, LIKE, 
RIGHT THERE.

472
00:16:31,781 --> 00:16:33,325
- HEY, GUYS.

473
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:36,036
IF YOU'RE GONNA PARTY, 
YOU WANNA BRING IT INSIDE?

474
00:16:36,036 --> 00:16:37,621
- THAT WAS A FREEBIE.

475
00:16:37,621 --> 00:16:39,873
- WELL, THE NEW FACILITY 
ISN'T SO BAD, HUH?

476
00:16:39,873 --> 00:16:41,833
IT'S A LOT LIKE SCHOOL, 
ONLY IT'S AIR-CONDITIONED.

477
00:16:41,833 --> 00:16:43,085
SO I GUESS WE CAN JUST, UH--

478
00:16:43,085 --> 00:16:45,754
JUST CHOOSE A CELL TO STAY 
OVERNIGHT IN AND, UH--

479
00:16:45,754 --> 00:16:47,964
- OH, GREAT. AND YOU CAN TAKE ME 
THROUGH YOUR THOUGHTS

480
00:16:47,964 --> 00:16:49,591
ABOUT THE SCREENPLAY 
BEAT BY BEAT.

481
00:16:49,591 --> 00:16:51,468
- SURE. YEAH. "BECAUSE 
ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN

482
00:16:51,468 --> 00:16:54,263
WHEN TWO PEOPLE 
SHARE A CELL, COZ."

483
00:16:54,263 --> 00:16:57,682
IT'S A LINE FROM-- 
FROM "NEW WARDEN."

484
00:16:57,682 --> 00:16:58,642
- OH. OH!

485
00:16:58,642 --> 00:17:02,479
OKAY, YEAH. I DON'T KNOW 
WHAT I WAS WORRIED ABOUT.

486
00:17:02,479 --> 00:17:05,357
narrator: THAT WOULD BE 
THE HAPPIEST MOMENT

487
00:17:05,357 --> 00:17:09,444
GEORGE MICHAEL WOULD EVER 
EXPERIENCE IN HIS LIFE.

488
00:17:09,444 --> 00:17:11,321
AND THE WARDEN WAS HAPPY TOO.

489
00:17:11,321 --> 00:17:13,032
- WHAT A TREAT.

490
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:17,369
THE MAN WHO COST ME MY PROMOTION 
ENDS UP BACK IN MY CARE.

491
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:18,995
AND I DON'T THINK 
THERE'S GOING TO BE

492
00:17:18,995 --> 00:17:22,416
AN "I'M OSCAR" WEB SITE 
THIS TIME.

493
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:26,002
- THINK THIS TIME 
I'LL DO A PODCAST.

494
00:17:26,002 --> 00:17:29,464
- "GRAFT VERSUS HOST." 
SOUNDS LIKE A TENNIS MATCH

495
00:17:29,464 --> 00:17:32,551
BETWEEN STEFFI GRAF AND "HAPPY 
DAYS" STAR DONNY HOST.

496
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:33,760
narrator: 
IT'S "MOST."

497
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:34,886
- BUT IT'S FAR DEADLIER.

498
00:17:34,886 --> 00:17:38,515
HELLO. I'M GOB BLUTH.

499
00:17:38,515 --> 00:17:41,726
AS A MAGICIAN, I CAN MAKE 
A LOT OF THINGS DISAPPEAR.

500
00:17:41,726 --> 00:17:44,563
THERE ARE SOME THINGS 
I CAN'T MAKE DISAPPEAR--

501
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:48,067
NO, NOT THAT 
CANDY BALL MACHINE--

502
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:50,902
THE DISEASE G.V.H. 
WITHOUT YOUR HELP.

503
00:17:50,902 --> 00:17:51,903
THIS IS TOBIAS.

504
00:17:51,903 --> 00:17:54,073
WHEN TOBY 
FIRST CAME INTO THE FAMILY,

505
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:56,491
NONE OF US MUCH 
WANTED HIM AROUND,

506
00:17:56,491 --> 00:17:59,161
BUT THAT'S BECAUSE WE COULDN'T 
SEE WHAT WAS ON THE INSIDE.

507
00:17:59,161 --> 00:18:01,037
BUT LATELY, THAT'S ALL 
WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO SEE.

508
00:18:01,037 --> 00:18:02,956
[woman gagging]

509
00:18:02,956 --> 00:18:05,417
BUT WHAT WAS TOBIAS TO DO-- 
[crowd groans]

510
00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:08,087
HAVE HIS HAIR PLUGS REMOVED?

511
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:09,088
- THE DOCTOR SAYS

512
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:11,673
I'D BE COMPLETELY HEALED 
IF I WERE TO DO THAT.

513
00:18:11,673 --> 00:18:13,175
- HE JUST NEEDS 
HIS HAIR PLUGS OUT?

514
00:18:13,175 --> 00:18:15,510
- DOCTOR SAYS THAT'S THE CURE.

515
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:16,553
- THERE'S A CURE?

516
00:18:16,553 --> 00:18:19,848
- NO WAY. THAT HORSEHAIR IS 
MY TICKET BACK INTO SOCIETY.

517
00:18:19,848 --> 00:18:21,558
YOU CUT IT AFTER THOSE IDIOTS 
AT THE GALA

518
00:18:21,558 --> 00:18:22,976
ACCEPT ME 
AS ONE OF THEIR OWN.

519
00:18:22,976 --> 00:18:24,436
- WE'RE GIVING MONEY 
FOR THIS GUY

520
00:18:24,436 --> 00:18:25,770
TO KEEP HIS HAIR TRANSPLANTS?

521
00:18:25,770 --> 00:18:28,440
- I'D RATHER GIVE TO T.B.A.! 
- [bleep]

522
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,942
narrator: 
THE CROWD BEGAN TO GROW UNRULY.

523
00:18:30,942 --> 00:18:33,737
- WE HAVE A RIOT 
IN THE BALLROOM.

524
00:18:33,737 --> 00:18:36,448
narrator: AND, JUST AS THE 
PRISONERS HAD PROVEN

525
00:18:36,448 --> 00:18:38,950
THEY COULD THROW A GALA 
AS WELL AS THE RICH,

526
00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:40,034
SO THE RICH PROVED

527
00:18:40,034 --> 00:18:42,996
THEY COULD THROW A RIOT 
JUST AS WELL AS THE PRISONERS.

528
00:18:42,996 --> 00:18:45,540
AND LUCILLE WAS BROUGHT 
TO THE CONJUGAL TRAILER.

529
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:46,750
- MOM.

530
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:47,917
- MICHAEL, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

531
00:18:47,917 --> 00:18:49,461
- I CANNOT LET YOU 
GO THROUGH WITH THIS.

532
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:51,921
YOU CAN'T SLEEP WITH HIM. 
- OH, YES I CAN.

533
00:18:51,921 --> 00:18:54,299
I'M MAKING UP FOR THE HEARTBREAK 
YOUR FATHER HAS CAUSED ME.

534
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:55,467
HE DOESN'T NEED ME.

535
00:18:55,467 --> 00:18:56,426
YOU DON'T NEED ME.

536
00:18:56,426 --> 00:18:59,221
- OF COURSE I NEED YOU, MOM.

537
00:18:59,221 --> 00:19:00,639
MY HEART IS KIND OF BROKEN TOO.

538
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:02,807
I'VE BEEN KIND OF 
DENYING IT LATELY, BUT,

539
00:19:02,807 --> 00:19:04,268
UM, YOU KNOW, 
IT JUST--I CAN'T--

540
00:19:04,268 --> 00:19:05,269
I CAN'T DEAL WITH THE FACT

541
00:19:05,269 --> 00:19:07,854
THAT MY FAMILY'S FALLING APART, 
NOW THAT I REALLY NEED YOU.

542
00:19:07,854 --> 00:19:12,609
- OH, MICHAEL, HONEY. 
I WANNA CRY SO BAD,

543
00:19:12,609 --> 00:19:16,070
BUT I DON'T THINK 
I CAN SPARE THE MOISTURE.

544
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:17,947
- WELL, LISTEN. HERE'S--

545
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:23,245
THE PROBLEM IS THAT, UH, GENTLES 
DOESN'T REALLY CARE FOR YOU.

546
00:19:23,245 --> 00:19:25,247
HE'S JUST USING YOU TO GET BACK 
AT DAD FOR ESCAPING,

547
00:19:25,247 --> 00:19:26,831
AT LEAST ACCORDING TO HIS 
SCREENPLAY.

548
00:19:26,831 --> 00:19:28,667
- YOU READ IT? 
- YEAH.

549
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:30,794
- DID YOU LIKE THE CHLAMYDIA 
THING? I GAVE HIM THAT.

550
00:19:30,794 --> 00:19:32,546
- YOU GAVE HIM CHLAMYDIA?

551
00:19:32,546 --> 00:19:34,839
- HE HAD "CRABS," AND I SAID, 
"YOU'RE GONNA GET LAUGHS."

552
00:19:34,839 --> 00:19:37,301
- THEN WHAT AM I DOING?

553
00:19:37,301 --> 00:19:41,638
I MEAN, IF DAD DOESN'T CARE, 
THERE'S--THERE'S NO REAL THREAT

554
00:19:41,638 --> 00:19:44,183
AND, I GUESS, JUST 
KNOCK YOURSELF OUT, HUH?

555
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:46,518
- WHERE'S GENTLES? 
I'LL KILL HIM!

556
00:19:46,518 --> 00:19:47,477
- GEORGE? 
- DAD?

557
00:19:47,477 --> 00:19:48,728
- I CAN'T LET YOU DO THIS.

558
00:19:48,728 --> 00:19:49,938
I CAN'T LET WHAT WE HAVE--

559
00:19:49,938 --> 00:19:53,983
AS LOUSY AS IT MAY BE 
AT TIMES--BE DESTROYED.

560
00:19:53,983 --> 00:19:57,487
- THIS IS WHERE YOU ESCAPED TO? 
TO PRISON? FOR ME?

561
00:19:57,487 --> 00:19:59,239
- NO ONE IS BREAKING 
THIS FAMILY APART.

562
00:19:59,239 --> 00:20:00,949
NO ONE.

563
00:20:00,949 --> 00:20:03,159
- YOU KNOW WHAT? 
I THINK I NEEDED TO HEAR THAT.

564
00:20:03,159 --> 00:20:05,329
- SORRY ABOUT THE WAIT. 
GEORGE?

565
00:20:05,329 --> 00:20:09,958
IF YOU'RE HERE, WHO DO WE HAVE 
IN THE DELOUSING TANK?

566
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:12,877
- I'M GUESSING OSCAR. 
- NO.

567
00:20:12,877 --> 00:20:15,214
I CANNOT TAKE 
ANOTHER $2,300 HIT.

568
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:16,047
- I'LL TELL YOU WHAT.

569
00:20:16,047 --> 00:20:19,343
YOU LET OSCAR OUT, 
AND YOU GIVE US AN HOUR IN HERE,

570
00:20:19,343 --> 00:20:22,887
AND, UH, 
WE'LL CALL IT EVEN.

571
00:20:24,556 --> 00:20:25,765
- PLEASE, WARD?

572
00:20:25,765 --> 00:20:30,312
- I CAN'T SAY NO TO THE WOMAN 
WHO GAVE ME "CHLAMYDIA."

573
00:20:30,312 --> 00:20:31,521
ONE HOUR.

574
00:20:34,899 --> 00:20:36,818
- ARE YOU READY 
TO HAVE SOME FUN?

575
00:20:36,818 --> 00:20:39,446
- I AM SO GLAD I DIDN'T CRY.

576
00:20:39,446 --> 00:20:41,490
- THAT I DIDN'T NEED TO HEAR.

577
00:20:43,575 --> 00:20:46,202
narrator: ON THE NEXT 
"ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT."

578
00:20:46,202 --> 00:20:48,247
GEORGE MICHAEL 
GETS CLOSER TO HIS FAMILY.

579
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:49,205
[alarm buzzes]

580
00:20:49,205 --> 00:20:50,123
- LOCKDOWN!

581
00:20:50,123 --> 00:20:52,959
- THAT WAS CLOSE, HUH, MAEBY?

582
00:20:52,959 --> 00:20:55,211
- OH, SHE'S IN THE NEXT CELL.

583
00:20:55,211 --> 00:20:57,589
LOOKS LIKE WE'RE GONNA BE 
BUNK BUDDIES ALL NIGHT, COZ.

584
00:20:57,589 --> 00:20:58,590
[coughing]

585
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:00,384
- narrator: 
GEORGE MICHAEL EXPERIENCES

586
00:21:00,384 --> 00:21:02,218
HIS UNHAPPIEST MOMENT EVER.

587
00:21:03,094 --> 00:21:06,431
BUSTER TRIES TO FORGET 
HIS RECENT LOSSES--

588
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:08,224
- [singing] JUST--

589
00:21:08,224 --> 00:21:10,226
narrator: BY BREAKING OUT 
THE OLD GUITAR,

590
00:21:10,226 --> 00:21:13,897
AND GOB FINALLY FACES 
A PHOBIA HE'D FACED BEFORE.

591
00:21:13,897 --> 00:21:15,189
- NO! NOT HERE!

592
00:21:15,189 --> 00:21:17,276
WAIT, I'VE SEEN THIS BEFORE.

593
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:20,279
OH, GOD, I'VE SEEN THIS BEFORE!

594
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:20,987
AH!

595
00:21:20,987 --> 00:21:22,572
[taser buzzing]
