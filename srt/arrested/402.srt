00:00:11,041 --> 00:00:13,000
NARRATOR:
<i>It was over a hundred degrees</i>

2
00:00:13,041 --> 00:00:17,000
<i>on the border of California</i>
<i>and Mexico.</i>

3
00:00:17,041 --> 00:00:19,417
<i>But that was nothing</i>
<i>compared to the temperature</i>

4
00:00:19,458 --> 00:00:22,834
<i>inside George Sr.'s</i>
<i>desert sweat lodge...</i>

5
00:00:22,875 --> 00:00:24,417
So hot.

6
00:00:24,458 --> 00:00:27,125
<i>...where he had gathered</i>
<i>a group of CEOs...</i>

7
00:00:27,166 --> 00:00:28,542
ALL:
So hot.

8
00:00:28,583 --> 00:00:30,834
<i>...with the promise of</i>
<i>spiritual enlightenment...</i>

9
00:00:30,875 --> 00:00:32,875
Anybody hallucinating yet?

10
00:00:32,917 --> 00:00:36,000
Did anybody else
hear that iguana speak?

11
00:00:36,041 --> 00:00:39,250
<i>...as a stepping stone</i>
<i>to financial empowerment.</i>

12
00:00:39,291 --> 00:00:40,417
Let's kill it.

13
00:00:40,458 --> 00:00:42,625
Okay. They're ready.

14
00:00:42,667 --> 00:00:44,667
<i>Of course, there were</i>
<i>certain occupational hazards.</i>

15
00:00:44,709 --> 00:00:46,125
-All right, guys, easy.
-(men murmuring)

16
00:00:46,166 --> 00:00:47,834
-I'm not...
-Kill the iguana.

17
00:00:47,875 --> 00:00:49,875
I'm not an iguana.

18
00:00:49,917 --> 00:00:51,917
It's part of the process.

19
00:00:51,959 --> 00:00:54,583
They're ready.
They're ready!

20
00:00:54,625 --> 00:00:55,917
NARRATOR:
<i>Now the story</i>

21
00:00:55,959 --> 00:00:59,208
<i>of a family whose future</i>
<i>was abruptly canceled</i>

22
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:01,166
<i>and the one father</i>
<i>who had no choice</i>

23
00:01:01,208 --> 00:01:03,417
<i>but to keep himself together.</i>

24
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:09,458
<i>It's George Sr.'s...</i>

25
00:01:13,458 --> 00:01:15,834
NARRATOR:<i> George Sr. was</i>
getting ready to motivate

26
00:01:15,875 --> 00:01:20,083
<i>his gathered CEOs</i>
<i>after a narrow brush with death</i>

27
00:01:20,125 --> 00:01:22,542
<i>at the hands</i>
<i>of a Frito-Lay executive.</i>

28
00:01:22,583 --> 00:01:23,542
(George Sr. whoops)

29
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:25,125
Yeah!

30
00:01:25,166 --> 00:01:27,917
Now, that was the most
invigorating session yet.

31
00:01:27,959 --> 00:01:29,792
I feel good.

32
00:01:29,834 --> 00:01:31,250
You feel good?

33
00:01:31,291 --> 00:01:33,458
<i>This is George Sr.</i>

34
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:34,750
I got you.

35
00:01:34,792 --> 00:01:36,417
You know, guys,
even I, Father B.,

36
00:01:36,458 --> 00:01:38,000
when I first started
these sweat lodges,

37
00:01:38,041 --> 00:01:39,417
I would come
out of there thinking,

38
00:01:39,458 --> 00:01:42,291
oh, God, I wish
I had a... a lemonade.

39
00:01:42,333 --> 00:01:44,125
Just like a child, you know.

40
00:01:44,166 --> 00:01:47,875
Cold water, some lemons,
a little sugar, you know.

41
00:01:47,917 --> 00:01:50,291
That's what I gave my power to!

42
00:01:50,333 --> 00:01:52,000
Can we have
the teaching pitcher please?

43
00:01:52,041 --> 00:01:53,000
Heartfire.

44
00:01:53,041 --> 00:01:54,625
Hey, guys, this is Heartfire.

45
00:01:54,667 --> 00:01:55,750
She is silent,

46
00:01:55,792 --> 00:01:59,542
but in that silence,
there is strength.

47
00:01:59,583 --> 00:02:01,583
She needs no words
to communicate to you.

48
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:07,417
Boundless power
to you, too, Heartfire.

49
00:02:07,458 --> 00:02:10,000
Hell, I was so weak, you guys,

50
00:02:10,041 --> 00:02:14,875
I was willing to spend $10,000
just a little...

51
00:02:14,917 --> 00:02:15,875
(slurps)

52
00:02:15,917 --> 00:02:17,417
...sip of this lemonade.

53
00:02:17,458 --> 00:02:18,834
MAN (breathily):
Fifteen!

54
00:02:18,875 --> 00:02:21,500
But now I can spend
two hours in brutal heat

55
00:02:21,542 --> 00:02:23,500
with a cup of this
cold, refreshing lemonade

56
00:02:23,542 --> 00:02:25,291
and just pour it in the dirt.

57
00:02:25,333 --> 00:02:27,000
-(yells, whimpers)
-Ah, come on, Daniels!

58
00:02:27,041 --> 00:02:29,250
You ran Bear Stearns,
for God's sake!

59
00:02:29,291 --> 00:02:30,417
I was like this.

60
00:02:30,458 --> 00:02:32,333
Just like this.

61
00:02:32,375 --> 00:02:34,333
Then I went to the desert
to seek answers,

62
00:02:34,375 --> 00:02:36,375
and now I have them.

63
00:02:36,417 --> 00:02:39,083
<i>Actually, George Sr.</i>
<i>had come to the desert</i>

64
00:02:39,125 --> 00:02:41,458
<i>to escape questions.</i>

65
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:44,291
<i>Years earlier, after duping</i>
<i>his twin brother Oscar...</i>

66
00:02:44,333 --> 00:02:46,375
-You gave me up, George.
-George? I'm not George.

67
00:02:46,417 --> 00:02:48,166
<i>...into taking his place</i>
<i>at a party</i>

68
00:02:48,208 --> 00:02:50,583
<i>the family held</i>
on the Queen Mary,

69
00:02:50,625 --> 00:02:52,917
<i>George Sr. stowed away</i>
<i>with a son</i>

70
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:54,583
<i>who was also</i>
<i>fleeing the family.</i>

71
00:02:54,625 --> 00:02:57,166
How was the party?

72
00:02:57,208 --> 00:02:58,667
Mom stole it.

73
00:02:58,709 --> 00:03:00,917
-The whole boat?
<i>-She had.</i>

74
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:03,375
<i>-As she fled to sea... </i>
-Full steam, boys!

75
00:03:03,417 --> 00:03:06,959
<i>...a strategy</i>
<i>their lawyer's son came up with</i>

76
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
<i>on his first day back in</i>
<i>the country after law school.</i>

77
00:03:09,041 --> 00:03:10,500
I'm wondering if
we shouldn't have a plan

78
00:03:10,542 --> 00:03:12,166
in regards to bookkeeping,

79
00:03:12,208 --> 00:03:14,917
in case we accidentally
make a mistake or get caught.

80
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:19,750
What if we were
to become a... an-an... an NLC?

81
00:03:19,792 --> 00:03:22,041
-Ooh!
-A "No Liability Corporation."

82
00:03:22,083 --> 00:03:24,125
We just have no liability,
just nothing...

83
00:03:24,166 --> 00:03:27,041
Well, first of all, I would
avoid doing anything illegal.

84
00:03:27,083 --> 00:03:28,333
May I make a suggestion?

85
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:30,542
-Sure.
-Take to the sea!

86
00:03:30,583 --> 00:03:32,291
Three miles out,
and it's a free-for-all!

87
00:03:32,333 --> 00:03:34,542
No rules, pirate radio laws.

88
00:03:34,583 --> 00:03:37,667
Really!
Is this true, Mr. Zuckerkorn?

89
00:03:37,709 --> 00:03:39,375
Sure.

90
00:03:39,417 --> 00:03:41,375
So we will stick together
and have

91
00:03:41,417 --> 00:03:43,333
all of our meetings on boats.

92
00:03:43,375 --> 00:03:45,458
Well, uh, I don't know
if that's necessary.

93
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:47,208
Yeah, because they don't have to
be together, because you can't

94
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:48,750
try a husband and wife
for the same crime, right?

95
00:03:48,792 --> 00:03:50,542
Sure.

96
00:03:50,583 --> 00:03:52,834
We have the best
(bleep) attorneys.

97
00:03:52,875 --> 00:03:54,875
You think we should go back?

98
00:03:54,917 --> 00:03:57,083
Absolutely. She's your mother.

99
00:03:57,125 --> 00:03:58,709
Family has to stick together.

100
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:00,375
You're afraid
she'll turn on you.

101
00:04:00,417 --> 00:04:02,500
Won't even leave the table
during a dinner party.

102
00:04:02,542 --> 00:04:03,792
Okay.

103
00:04:03,834 --> 00:04:05,500
We're going back,
George Michael!

104
00:04:05,542 --> 00:04:08,417
<i>It turned out, Lucille had</i>
<i>returned to shore, too.</i>

105
00:04:08,458 --> 00:04:10,333
(over TV):
Why the alleged ship-jacker

106
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:12,041
changed direction
is still unexplained.

107
00:04:12,083 --> 00:04:14,375
<i>And soon the family met up</i>

108
00:04:14,417 --> 00:04:16,041
<i>at the beginning</i>
<i>of a fourth season...</i>

109
00:04:16,083 --> 00:04:18,000
-My wife, how is she?
<i>-...that would never come.</i>

110
00:04:18,041 --> 00:04:19,542
She's fine. You're lucky
we didn't have an autumn,

111
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:20,625
otherwise she'd be colder.

112
00:04:20,667 --> 00:04:22,000
Look what they've done, George!

113
00:04:22,041 --> 00:04:24,208
Look what the homosexuals
have done to me.

114
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:25,917
A joyride.

115
00:04:25,959 --> 00:04:27,792
That's what they decide to do
with the freedom

116
00:04:27,834 --> 00:04:29,417
this country has given them.

117
00:04:29,458 --> 00:04:31,125
(quietly): That's the best alibi
I've been able

118
00:04:31,166 --> 00:04:33,291
to come up with, because
our lawyer says he thinks

119
00:04:33,333 --> 00:04:35,875
he can get rid
of the SEC charges,

120
00:04:35,917 --> 00:04:38,834
but he's worried about
the pirating of the<i> Queen Mary.</i>

121
00:04:38,875 --> 00:04:40,792
Says they have
a suit against us.

122
00:04:40,834 --> 00:04:43,333
-Where is Barry?
-He's with the harbormaster.

123
00:04:43,375 --> 00:04:46,166
He's trying to dazzle them
with a suit of his own.

124
00:04:46,208 --> 00:04:48,166
Well, he hated the suit.

125
00:04:48,208 --> 00:04:50,083
Thought I was making fun.

126
00:04:50,125 --> 00:04:53,417
But basically, this is
a "good news/bad news" deal.

127
00:04:53,458 --> 00:04:55,709
First of all, won't be cheap.

128
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:57,959
It's gonna cost you
a fortune in legal fees.

129
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,917
-What's the good news?
-Oh, yeah.

130
00:04:59,959 --> 00:05:01,583
Well, from your perspective,
I can see where

131
00:05:01,625 --> 00:05:02,875
you think it's all bad news.

132
00:05:02,917 --> 00:05:04,083
It's all bad news.

133
00:05:04,125 --> 00:05:05,333
Also, it turns out

134
00:05:05,375 --> 00:05:06,875
that stealing the<i> Queen Mary</i>

135
00:05:06,917 --> 00:05:08,417
comes under maritime law,

136
00:05:08,458 --> 00:05:10,709
which, I just found out,
is an actual thing.

137
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:11,709
It's a real thing.

138
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:12,834
Don't you worry.

139
00:05:12,875 --> 00:05:13,834
We got three months

140
00:05:13,875 --> 00:05:15,375
to prepare for this hearing.

141
00:05:15,417 --> 00:05:17,959
<i>And so, George Sr.</i>
<i>went to his competitor,</i>

142
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,917
<i>Stan Sitwell, with an offer,</i>

143
00:05:19,959 --> 00:05:22,667
<i>so he could afford to cover</i>
<i>Lucille's high legal fees.</i>

144
00:05:22,709 --> 00:05:25,458
Buy the rest of your stock?
You got to be kidding me.

145
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,500
I already dumped the stock
I owned to Lucille Austero.

146
00:05:27,542 --> 00:05:28,959
Don't forget,
I was on that boat.

147
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,417
And believe me, I lost

148
00:05:30,458 --> 00:05:32,458
more than just the 50 grand
on that sale.

149
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:34,709
I also lost
a perfectly good pair of

150
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:37,125
human chest hair nipple tufts
when we hit the water.

151
00:05:37,166 --> 00:05:39,709
<i>Stan Sitwell</i>
<i>suffered from alopecia,</i>

152
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:41,291
<i>a condition</i>
<i>that rendered him hairless.</i>

153
00:05:41,333 --> 00:05:43,542
That's kelp;
why would I put it onto my chest

154
00:05:43,583 --> 00:05:45,125
or head or anywhere else?

155
00:05:45,166 --> 00:05:46,667
STAN:<i> I was gonna</i>
<i>show those babies off</i>

156
00:05:46,709 --> 00:05:48,667
-at the Jacuzzi after-party.
-Come on, Stan.

157
00:05:48,709 --> 00:05:50,291
I'm offering you
the chance to double

158
00:05:50,333 --> 00:05:52,250
-the size of your business.
-Way ahead of you.

159
00:05:52,291 --> 00:05:53,792
I've got a big project
coming up.

160
00:05:53,834 --> 00:05:55,625
And even you can't
compete for this one,

161
00:05:55,667 --> 00:05:56,625
with your business in the shape
that it's in.

162
00:05:56,667 --> 00:05:57,709
This is a biggie.

163
00:05:57,750 --> 00:05:58,834
I get this contract,

164
00:05:58,875 --> 00:06:00,458
and it gets government approval,

165
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:02,041
I'll be bigger than Halliburton.

166
00:06:02,083 --> 00:06:03,625
Well, maybe not Halliburton,

167
00:06:03,667 --> 00:06:05,166
but definitely Halliburton Teen.

168
00:06:05,208 --> 00:06:06,875
NARRATOR:
<i>Halliburton Teen was a leading</i>

169
00:06:06,917 --> 00:06:09,208
<i>youth and lifestyle retailer,</i>
<i>despite the fact</i>

00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:14,125
<i>that it was a rebranding</i>

00:06:18,458 --> 00:06:20,458
<i>spawned this company.</i>

174
00:06:22,333 --> 00:06:23,834
Anyway, you're too late.

175
00:06:23,875 --> 00:06:25,458
The contract is
practically mine.

176
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,917
Even you can't underbid me.
(chuckles)

177
00:06:27,959 --> 00:06:30,500
Well, you may have
a bigger business than me,

178
00:06:30,542 --> 00:06:33,542
but you will never have this.

179
00:06:33,583 --> 00:06:35,458
And believe me,
I'm gonna find out

180
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,834
that project you're working on,
even if I have to search

181
00:06:37,875 --> 00:06:41,000
the public records
for the blueprints myself.

182
00:06:41,041 --> 00:06:42,583
Unless you search
in this office,

183
00:06:42,625 --> 00:06:44,250
you will never find them.

184
00:06:51,458 --> 00:06:53,375
Oh... aah...!

185
00:06:53,417 --> 00:06:55,583
Ow, my hair!
My beautiful hair!

186
00:06:55,625 --> 00:06:58,750
(gasping, groaning)

187
00:06:58,792 --> 00:07:00,417
<i>My</i> hair!
<i>My</i> beautiful hair!

188
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:03,041
(camera clicks)

189
00:07:03,083 --> 00:07:04,458
This isn't what it looks like!

190
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,000
Oh, really?

191
00:07:06,041 --> 00:07:09,375
Because it looks like a monument
to George W. Bush.

192
00:07:10,875 --> 00:07:13,333
Well, you got me.

193
00:07:13,375 --> 00:07:15,333
You're in for
a rude awakening, Sitwell.

194
00:07:15,375 --> 00:07:16,959
It'll never stand.

195
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,291
It's too thin.

196
00:07:19,333 --> 00:07:21,750
It'll never stand.

197
00:07:21,792 --> 00:07:23,792
(quietly): You see, the W's
and the word "bush."

198
00:07:23,834 --> 00:07:25,542
I mean, what else could it be?

199
00:07:25,583 --> 00:07:29,125
You mean other than
a 20-foot-wide monument

200
00:07:29,166 --> 00:07:31,125
that goes five miles
into the sky?

201
00:07:31,166 --> 00:07:33,667
I know, I know. And I told him
it wouldn't stand,

202
00:07:33,709 --> 00:07:36,083
which I probably shouldn't have.

203
00:07:36,125 --> 00:07:39,458
It's a wall, George;
you're looking at it sideways.

204
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:42,083
The W stands for "wall."

205
00:07:42,125 --> 00:07:43,291
The bushes...

206
00:07:43,333 --> 00:07:44,875
Stand for the bushes.

207
00:07:44,917 --> 00:07:47,083
Ah-- this explains
the immigration booth

208
00:07:47,125 --> 00:07:49,000
10,000 feet in the air.

209
00:07:49,041 --> 00:07:51,333
It's to separate
the U.S. and Mexico,

210
00:07:51,375 --> 00:07:53,500
to keep out the immigrants,
which was<i> my idea!</i>

211
00:07:53,542 --> 00:07:55,208
Was your idea. I remember.

212
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:58,000
You said that right after
Lupe got the bleach stain

213
00:07:58,041 --> 00:07:59,500
on your teal blazer.

214
00:07:59,542 --> 00:08:01,583
How did you miss this, George?

215
00:08:01,625 --> 00:08:04,166
This is business we should have.

216
00:08:04,208 --> 00:08:06,959
Is this how you're going to
let it all end, as a failure?

217
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,667
-Is that your plan?
-No.

218
00:08:08,709 --> 00:08:10,375
Of course not.

219
00:08:10,417 --> 00:08:13,291
<i>It was his plan.</i>

220
00:08:15,542 --> 00:08:18,792
NARRATOR:<i> George Sr. felt</i>
<i>discouraged and alone...</i>

221
00:08:18,834 --> 00:08:21,291
Bluth for two-- I mean, one.

222
00:08:21,333 --> 00:08:23,041
I thought I already seated you.

223
00:08:23,083 --> 00:08:26,291
<i>...when he saw a familiar face:</i>
<i>his own...</i>

224
00:08:26,333 --> 00:08:29,709
<i>...on his twin brother Oscar.</i>

225
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:32,041
George!
Actually, we came in

226
00:08:32,083 --> 00:08:34,250
to use the bathroom,
but they sat me.

227
00:08:34,291 --> 00:08:36,625
And they have mahimahi today.

228
00:08:36,667 --> 00:08:38,834
Will you join us?
Will you have a mahimahi on me?

229
00:08:38,875 --> 00:08:41,083
-On you.
-Fine, but I'm gonna

230
00:08:41,125 --> 00:08:43,959
sit opposite you,
so it won't look bad.

231
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,250
These are my friends; we all
live in the desert together.

232
00:08:46,291 --> 00:08:49,125
This is Heartfire;
she's an aura specialist.

233
00:08:49,166 --> 00:08:50,208
She did Matthew Modine.

234
00:08:53,083 --> 00:08:54,583
I will.

235
00:08:54,625 --> 00:08:56,709
Heartfire would like
some more crackers.

236
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:58,667
Oscar, you don't believe
that nonsense, do you?

237
00:08:58,709 --> 00:09:00,333
No, no, no. You're a skeptic.

238
00:09:00,375 --> 00:09:02,959
But I'll tell you something,
the desert changes you.

239
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,959
Dr. Norman is
a disgraced anesthesiologist.

240
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,125
Oh.

241
00:09:06,166 --> 00:09:07,792
The bigger crime would've been

242
00:09:07,834 --> 00:09:09,709
the patient didn't wake up
and testify against me.

243
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:12,083
But nobody cares about the part
of the oath he kept.

244
00:09:12,125 --> 00:09:13,458
I'll tell you this.

245
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,792
If that nastiness
had never happened,

246
00:09:15,834 --> 00:09:17,333
I never would've gotten
those prison pen pal letters

247
00:09:17,375 --> 00:09:20,208
from the most beautiful woman
in the world.

248
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:23,000
(loudly): If he as bad as the
state of California say he is,

249
00:09:23,041 --> 00:09:25,875
then why did I fall in love
with him, huh?

250
00:09:25,917 --> 00:09:27,875
Yo, (bleep) the state
of California!

251
00:09:27,917 --> 00:09:29,083
(bleep) 'em!

252
00:09:29,125 --> 00:09:33,041
Bunch of
California (bleep), yeah.

253
00:09:33,083 --> 00:09:35,667
As you can imagine,
her letters really stood out.

254
00:09:35,709 --> 00:09:37,375
Do you know China Garden?

255
00:09:37,417 --> 00:09:39,250
I know the downtown one.

256
00:09:39,291 --> 00:09:40,583
You know, I shouldn't judge.

257
00:09:40,625 --> 00:09:43,125
'Cause you have friends,
and I...

258
00:09:43,166 --> 00:09:44,625
I envy that.

259
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:47,834
You're welcome
to my friends, brother.

260
00:09:51,208 --> 00:09:53,792
I don't want these.

261
00:09:53,834 --> 00:09:56,250
<i>But perhaps due to</i>
<i>the absence of Lucille,</i>

262
00:09:56,291 --> 00:09:59,333
<i>the two brothers connected</i>
<i>as they hadn't in years.</i>

263
00:09:59,375 --> 00:10:01,208
I'm not the big man
I thought I was.

264
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:04,000
Forget the past, George.

265
00:10:04,041 --> 00:10:06,250
I don't know; maybe it's
because I live on the border

266
00:10:06,291 --> 00:10:08,291
between the United States
and Mexico and...

267
00:10:08,333 --> 00:10:10,291
Hold on. Border?

268
00:10:10,333 --> 00:10:12,667
You don't think I live
like this all the time, do you?

269
00:10:12,709 --> 00:10:15,625
That's why I had so much fun
at that party on the<i> Queen Mary.</i>

270
00:10:15,667 --> 00:10:17,917
And you paid for my haircut.

271
00:10:17,959 --> 00:10:20,083
And you made me...
dress like you.

272
00:10:20,125 --> 00:10:21,792
Forget the past.

273
00:10:21,834 --> 00:10:25,709
What were you saying about
that property on the border?

274
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:27,959
<i>And that's when George Sr.</i>
<i>first saw the desert property.</i>

275
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,250
<i>And the much smaller sweat</i>
<i>lodge that was on the land.</i>

276
00:10:31,291 --> 00:10:33,291
You live here?

277
00:10:33,333 --> 00:10:34,750
Ask him!

278
00:10:34,792 --> 00:10:36,709
Would you like
to watch us make love?

279
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:37,875
No. You live here?

280
00:10:37,917 --> 00:10:39,500
We have been.

281
00:10:39,542 --> 00:10:42,166
You see, Mexico starts
right at the end of that gully,

282
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:44,166
and we have to get
in and out of there

283
00:10:44,208 --> 00:10:45,875
so we can get at the maca root.

284
00:10:45,917 --> 00:10:47,667
What the hell is maca root?

285
00:10:47,709 --> 00:10:49,875
It's an ancient Aztec
power herb.

286
00:10:49,917 --> 00:10:51,125
It's an endocrine adaptogen.

287
00:10:51,166 --> 00:10:52,834
It's legal to grow in Mexico,

288
00:10:52,875 --> 00:10:55,000
but it's against the law
to consume it there.

289
00:10:55,041 --> 00:10:57,625
Of course, you can ingest it
here, but you can't grow it.

290
00:10:57,667 --> 00:11:00,625
And... you can bring it
into Mexico,

291
00:11:00,667 --> 00:11:03,208
but you can't bring it out.

292
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:05,208
So it's, uh, hard.

293
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:07,041
So you guys are knowingly
breaking the law?

294
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:10,458
But it's worth it, because maca
has powerful properties,

295
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:13,166
especially when combined with
an hour in the sweat lodge.

296
00:11:13,208 --> 00:11:16,417
It gets up to 110 degrees
in there.

297
00:11:16,458 --> 00:11:17,417
Sounds fun.

298
00:11:17,458 --> 00:11:19,625
Oh, but you have to do it
with us.

299
00:11:19,667 --> 00:11:21,917
You'll find a power
you didn't know you had.

300
00:11:21,959 --> 00:11:24,917
But, um, you want to do it soon,

301
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:29,125
(sobbing): because they're
kicking us off of the land.

302
00:11:29,166 --> 00:11:30,625
I'm sorry.

303
00:11:30,667 --> 00:11:32,500
Oh, great.
Now you're gonna make me cry.

304
00:11:32,542 --> 00:11:33,917
Oh, lizard! Look!
Look, a lizard!

305
00:11:33,959 --> 00:11:35,166
Cute!

306
00:11:35,208 --> 00:11:36,875
What if I were to buy
this land?

307
00:11:36,917 --> 00:11:38,959
I don't understand;
why would you want to do that?

308
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,375
Well, I always talk about
being a great man.

309
00:11:42,417 --> 00:11:45,291
Maybe a way to do that is
not by being

310
00:11:45,333 --> 00:11:47,333
the biggest businessman in
Southern California, it's...

311
00:11:47,375 --> 00:11:50,917
It's by being the best brother
in Southern California.

312
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:52,917
<i>George Sr. was going to say,</i>

313
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:55,250
<i>"By gouging the government</i>
<i>when they needed the land..."</i>

314
00:11:55,291 --> 00:11:56,667
You bet.

315
00:11:56,709 --> 00:11:59,041
Hey, guys, we're staying.

316
00:11:59,083 --> 00:12:00,583
Oh, thank you, brother.

317
00:12:00,625 --> 00:12:01,917
<i>...but he'd save that</i>
<i>for Lucille.</i>

318
00:12:01,959 --> 00:12:04,750
-Thank you, maca.
-Thank you, maca!

319
00:12:04,792 --> 00:12:06,333
And I can get this land
for a song.

320
00:12:06,375 --> 00:12:07,709
<i>George was proud of his plan.</i>

321
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:08,875
Are you listening to me?

322
00:12:08,917 --> 00:12:10,792
So are those cameras, George.

323
00:12:10,834 --> 00:12:12,291
We can't use the same cameras

324
00:12:12,333 --> 00:12:14,500
from when he was under
house arrest?

325
00:12:14,542 --> 00:12:16,583
WORKMAN: These are from
the maritime penal system.

326
00:12:16,625 --> 00:12:18,750
They make us use
the waterproof ones.

327
00:12:18,792 --> 00:12:20,333
-In here.
-Okay.

328
00:12:20,375 --> 00:12:22,083
GEORGE SR.:
<i>We're gonna sell that land</i>

329
00:12:22,125 --> 00:12:23,500
to the government
for Sitwell's wall,

330
00:12:23,542 --> 00:12:25,083
and I'm gonna take the cash.

331
00:12:25,125 --> 00:12:27,667
I am gonna mount a case
that shows that my wife

332
00:12:27,709 --> 00:12:29,792
is not the power-hungry monster

333
00:12:29,834 --> 00:12:32,250
the SEC wants
to make her out to be.

334
00:12:32,291 --> 00:12:34,667
You're such a puny thinker.

335
00:12:34,709 --> 00:12:36,000
Am I puny-thinking again?

336
00:12:36,041 --> 00:12:37,375
Sitwell's wall?

337
00:12:37,417 --> 00:12:40,291
How about our wall?
We build the wall.

338
00:12:40,333 --> 00:12:41,625
We do have the plan.

339
00:12:41,667 --> 00:12:43,709
He says he can build it
for $200 million,

340
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:45,834
we offer to build it
for $150 million,

341
00:12:45,875 --> 00:12:48,667
and we make up the difference
when we sell the land.

342
00:12:48,709 --> 00:12:52,500
And I use that cash
as a little stimulus for us.

343
00:12:52,542 --> 00:12:54,291
Maybe a little something
for the family.

344
00:12:54,333 --> 00:12:56,208
And we build that sucker...

345
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:57,458
That's my Georgie!

346
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:58,583
...five miles high.

347
00:12:58,625 --> 00:13:00,834
Long. Five miles long.

348
00:13:00,875 --> 00:13:04,417
I got nothing in my system
but a maca root cookie.

349
00:13:04,458 --> 00:13:06,291
-(clattering)
-So, that one's all set.

350
00:13:06,333 --> 00:13:08,166
Uh... can I put one up there?

351
00:13:08,208 --> 00:13:11,542
Only if you want to see the
sexiest video you've ever seen.

352

(George Sr. moans)

353
00:13:14,083 --> 00:13:17,625
Sorry I gave you
the old noodle stab in there.

354
00:13:17,667 --> 00:13:19,417
I needed
something in my system.

355
00:13:19,458 --> 00:13:22,291
You know, we can't look like
we're in cahoots on this.

356
00:13:22,333 --> 00:13:24,500
Especially with my trial
coming up.

357
00:13:24,542 --> 00:13:25,792
Yeah, that's right.

358
00:13:25,834 --> 00:13:27,875
We have to separate our assets.

359
00:13:27,917 --> 00:13:29,291
To protect this.

360
00:13:29,333 --> 00:13:32,000
To protect our love.

361
00:13:32,041 --> 00:13:33,667
NARRATOR:<i> And that's</i>
<i>when they got the idea</i>

362
00:13:33,709 --> 00:13:37,291

363
00:13:37,333 --> 00:13:39,208
-We're getting a divorce.
-(Buster screams)

364
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:40,959
I want to know about
the stimulus package.

365
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,583
We haven't had sex
since Christmas, Michael!

366

BUSTER:
Uh... I'm... I'm sorry.

367
00:13:45,875 --> 00:13:48,792
You had sex seven weeks ago?

368
00:13:48,834 --> 00:13:51,792
They were remodeling my room,
and I pulled my cot in there,

369
00:13:51,834 --> 00:13:54,208
-just like camp.
-We yelled at you to leave.

370
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:55,959
Yeah, but then you whispered,
"Don't pull out!"

371
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
(Gob screams)

372
00:13:58,041 --> 00:14:00,291
You didn't want to use

(Gob groans)

374
00:14:02,333 --> 00:14:05,291
You couldn't use any of that
money to finish Sudden Valley?

375
00:14:05,333 --> 00:14:07,417
<i>And although their plan</i>
<i>was dealt a minor setback</i>

376

378
00:14:11,792 --> 00:14:13,709
You know what?
I am done with this family.

379
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:15,166
I hope you've saved some money,

380
00:14:15,208 --> 00:14:17,000
'cause you're gonna need
every dime now.

381

<i>...all they had to do</i>

382
00:14:18,583 --> 00:14:20,250

00:14:20,291 --> 00:14:21,792

387
00:14:27,709 --> 00:14:29,208
<i>The housing prices</i>

<i>And the government</i>

393
00:14:39,792 --> 00:14:41,417
<i>Can't be on hold.</i>

394
00:14:41,458 --> 00:14:43,750
They already gave me the money
to start the building.

395
00:14:43,792 --> 00:14:46,583
No! I cannot live off of that!

396
00:14:46,625 --> 00:14:49,834
No, I already used that money
as the down payment

397
00:14:49,875 --> 00:14:51,917
of six square miles of desert

398
00:14:51,959 --> 00:14:53,917
I cannot afford
to make payments on!

399
00:14:55,166 --> 00:14:57,625
Oh, God... sorry, Norman.

400
00:14:57,667 --> 00:14:59,083
(inhales)

401
00:14:59,125 --> 00:15:00,375
(muffled):
Huh?

402
00:15:00,417 --> 00:15:01,709
Uh, nothing.

403
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:03,625
OSCAR:
Hey, brother, you seem tense.

404
00:15:03,667 --> 00:15:05,250
Come with me to the sweat lodge.

405
00:15:05,291 --> 00:15:07,291
Sweat out this frustration;
you can learn on this.

406
00:15:07,333 --> 00:15:09,667
<i>And perhaps</i>
<i>it was a sense of futility</i>

407
00:15:09,709 --> 00:15:12,375
<i>or the fact he hadn't</i>
<i>brought a book to the desert,</i>

408
00:15:12,417 --> 00:15:17,166
<i>but George Sr. chose to enter</i>
<i>the small, smoke-filled room,</i>

409
00:15:17,208 --> 00:15:19,166
<i>while his wife</i>
<i>was also confined</i>

410
00:15:19,208 --> 00:15:21,166
<i>to a smoke-filled room,</i>

411
00:15:21,208 --> 00:15:24,000
<i>having found a way around</i>
<i>both the building's strict</i>

00:15:24,041 --> 00:15:25,500
<i>no-smoking policy...</i>

413
00:15:27,875 --> 00:15:30,917
<i>...and the fact that her ankle</i>
<i>monitor prevented her</i>

414
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:34,291
<i>from approaching the balcony.</i>

415
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:37,333
So, anyways, I went down
to the club and I... I can't...

416
00:15:46,917 --> 00:15:49,250
My food was gone,
I could...

417
00:15:49,291 --> 00:15:52,875
That restaurant, typically,
has a really nice maitre d'...

418
00:16:02,917 --> 00:16:05,500
Can't really remember
the host's name,

419
00:16:05,542 --> 00:16:07,542
but he was...
he was kind of in his 60s...

420
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:13,917
(sputtering)

421
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:19,542
(sighs)

422
00:16:19,583 --> 00:16:21,667
(weakly):
I have to stop.

423
00:16:21,709 --> 00:16:24,500
I have to stop. So...

424
00:16:24,542 --> 00:16:26,917
(stammers)

425
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:28,875
(panting):
But, finally, I just ordered...

426
00:16:28,917 --> 00:16:31,208
pastrami shortcake, like I said,
but I didn't order...

427
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:33,208
I didn't order sprinkles this--
Oh, Mother, please.

428
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:34,834
(crying):
Please.

429
00:16:34,875 --> 00:16:37,458
<i>Meanwhile,</i>
<i>in George Sr.'s sweat lodge,</i>

430

431
00:16:40,667 --> 00:16:42,250
Kind of hot, huh?

432
00:16:44,208 --> 00:16:47,375
I'd give $10,000 for a glass
of lemonade right now.

433

<i>...in the form of a vision.</i>

434

<i>for two days</i>
<i>after having a vision...</i>

440

441
00:17:14,542 --> 00:17:16,917
<i>But soon,</i>
<i>he was hard at work...</i>

442
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:18,834
Okay, look up large mud huts.

443
00:17:18,875 --> 00:17:20,875
<i>-...making his vision a reality.</i>
-Can fit 20.

444
00:17:20,917 --> 00:17:22,750
Do a something search.
Um, used is fine.

445
00:17:22,792 --> 00:17:25,125
No, no, I got it.

446
00:17:25,166 --> 00:17:26,166

447
00:17:26,208 --> 00:17:27,291
See what you get.

448
00:17:28,583 --> 00:17:29,959
You got 'em?

449
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,458
All right, well, then, ship it!

450
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,667
<i>A sweat lodge,</i>
<i>where he could be</i>

All right, this whole area here,

453

this is going to be
visitor yurts.

454
00:17:41,792 --> 00:17:46,208
Oh, and we're gonna need
industrial-size juicers!

455
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:48,417
<i>He went to work</i>
<i>on constructing a seminar,</i>

456
00:17:48,458 --> 00:17:51,125

Will you read that back
to me, please?

461
00:17:58,583 --> 00:18:00,917
<i>This time, however, he needed</i>

<i>in an exclusively first-class</i>

<i>And soon the retreat was up</i>
<i>and running, and George Sr.</i>

470
00:18:20,041 --> 00:18:21,834
<i>was determined</i>
<i>to create the illusion</i>

471
00:18:21,875 --> 00:18:23,625
<i>of a first-class experience.</i>

472
00:18:23,667 --> 00:18:26,625

<i>reasonably priced at $1,000.</i>

474
00:18:30,583 --> 00:18:32,875
<i>The sweat and squeeze</i>
<i>was simple.</i>

475
00:18:32,917 --> 00:18:36,375
<i>First, George Sr. sweated out</i>
<i>his acolytes' defenses...</i>

476
00:18:36,417 --> 00:18:37,750
-(whimpering)
-Ah, come on, Daniels!

477
00:18:37,792 --> 00:18:39,750
You ran Bear Stearns,
for God's sake!

478
00:18:39,792 --> 00:18:41,166
I was like this.

479
00:18:41,208 --> 00:18:43,458
Then I went to the desert
to seek answers,

480
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:46,125
and now I have them.

481
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:48,583
<i>...and then it was time</i>
<i>for the squeeze.</i>

482
00:18:48,625 --> 00:18:51,875
And for another 15 grand,
you can have them, too.

483
00:18:51,917 --> 00:18:53,959
I'll teach you
how to get yachts,

484

I'll teach you how
to get penthouses,

something for yourself

who thinks it's his.

487
00:19:02,542 --> 00:19:05,125
Does it come with lemonade?

488
00:19:05,166 --> 00:19:07,083
It comes with all the lemonade
you can drink.

Hey.

Did you bring me some lemonade?

498
00:19:24,041 --> 00:19:26,917
No, sir.
It is crazy out there.

499
00:19:26,959 --> 00:19:29,667
For the first time we are out.

500
00:19:29,709 --> 00:19:32,417
Look what I brought you,

50 bucks-- your half.

502
00:19:34,834 --> 00:19:37,750
Oh, you know,
I feel bad taking this.

503
00:19:37,792 --> 00:19:39,667
All I did was sit and sweat.

504

Whoo! Yeah!

508
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:55,667
Now, that was the most

00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:06,083
-(groaning) -If I could give you
just one note, little energy.

512
00:20:06,125 --> 00:20:08,417
<i>As the retreat grew,</i>

513
00:20:08,458 --> 00:20:11,583
<i>George Sr. was finding himself</i>
<i>emboldened with power,</i>

514
00:20:11,625 --> 00:20:14,208
<i>while Oscar was bushed.</i>

515
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:16,375
Hey, Oscar, that scared me.

516
00:20:16,417 --> 00:20:17,917
Come on, man, get back in there.

517
00:20:17,959 --> 00:20:19,583
I was starting to sweat.

518
00:20:19,625 --> 00:20:21,583
I'm just trying
to get my strength up.

519
00:20:21,625 --> 00:20:22,875
Maca usually gets me there.

520
00:20:22,917 --> 00:20:25,542
Hey, chew some maca with me.

521
00:20:25,583 --> 00:20:27,834
I can't, okay, I got to go up
to see Lucille tomorrow.

522
00:20:27,875 --> 00:20:29,375
<i>George Sr. had been meeting</i>

523
00:20:29,417 --> 00:20:32,583
<i>with Lucille on a weekly basis</i>
<i>at her new home</i>

524
00:20:32,625 --> 00:20:34,917
<i>under the pretense</i>

525
00:20:34,959 --> 00:20:35,917
You look nice.

526
00:20:35,959 --> 00:20:37,333
Oh, stop trying to butter me up.

527
00:20:37,375 --> 00:20:39,125
Let's just get
this divorce agreed to

528
00:20:39,166 --> 00:20:40,625
so you can get out of here.

529
00:20:40,667 --> 00:20:42,125
(door closes)

530
00:20:42,166 --> 00:20:43,458
-(gasps)
-Oh, God.

531
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:44,458
It's almost
like adultery this way.

532
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:46,250
Good, I like that.

533
00:20:46,291 --> 00:20:48,542
-"My wife doesn't 
understand me."   
-My angel.

534
00:20:48,583 --> 00:20:50,625
(gasping and moaning)

535
00:20:50,667 --> 00:20:53,959
"I haven't had an orgasm outside
of my bathtub in 30 years."

536
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,375
How's that?

537
00:20:56,417 --> 00:20:58,959
GEORGE SR.:<i> Although, at times,</i>
<i>I do wish it were darker.</i>

538
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,000
It's too bad you don't
have time to try this.

539
00:21:02,041 --> 00:21:03,667
Yesterday,
I was talking to a lizard,

540
00:21:03,709 --> 00:21:05,959
and it turned into
Elizabeth Taylor.

541
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,208
-Young Elizabeth Taylor?
-Uh-huh.

542
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:09,834
Yeah, I could use some maca.

543
00:21:09,875 --> 00:21:11,417
Give me some of that.

544
00:21:11,458 --> 00:21:15,250
NARRATOR:
<i>And soon a vision did appear.</i>

545
00:21:15,291 --> 00:21:16,959
I don't know what's going on.

546
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,875
For some reason I'm just getting
Richard Burton today.

547
00:21:20,917 --> 00:21:23,166
Oh, my God, what's that?

548
00:21:23,208 --> 00:21:24,542
That's the commode.

549
00:21:24,583 --> 00:21:25,917
Are you at all concerned
that the maca bush

550
00:21:25,959 --> 00:21:27,208
is directly downhill from that?

551
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:28,875
<i>He should have been,</i>

552
00:21:28,917 --> 00:21:32,083
<i>but Oscar was actually</i>
<i>referring to what now appeared</i>

553
00:21:32,125 --> 00:21:35,959
<i>to be a divine spirit,</i>
<i>personified as an ostrich.</i>

554
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,083
You trespass on sacred ground.

555
00:21:38,125 --> 00:21:40,417
The spirits command me
to warn you.

556
00:21:40,458 --> 00:21:43,458
You must leave this land
or the land will change you.

557
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:45,375
GEORGE SR.:
Don't worry, he's probably

558
00:21:45,417 --> 00:21:47,583
from a local reservation.
I'll, I'll take care of this.

559
00:21:47,625 --> 00:21:51,709
How about you book me two nights
for Ray Romano at your casino?

560
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:56,375
The strong will become the weak,
the weak will become the strong.

561
00:21:56,417 --> 00:21:59,041
And get us close to the front
but not close enough

562
00:21:59,083 --> 00:22:01,125
that Ray talks to us.

563
00:22:01,166 --> 00:22:02,917
You have been warned.

564
00:22:04,834 --> 00:22:06,166
See ya.

565
00:22:08,083 --> 00:22:11,250
I don't know what you saw, but
I got an ostrich and no boner.

566
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:16,709
NARRATOR:
<i>One year after George Sr. had</i>

567
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:18,625
<i>the incident</i>
<i>with the ostrich guy,</i>

568
00:22:18,667 --> 00:22:20,583
<i>things had indeed started</i>
<i>to change.</i>

569
00:22:20,625 --> 00:22:22,125
Where was I? Um... oh, yeah.

570
00:22:22,166 --> 00:22:23,875
<i>Father B. had lost his command</i>
<i>over the crowd.</i>

571
00:22:23,917 --> 00:22:27,083
Who would like some lemonade
for $2,000?

572
00:22:28,875 --> 00:22:31,834
Come on, guys,
I looked the other way

573
00:22:31,875 --> 00:22:33,917
on the bottled water
because you look thirsty,

574
00:22:33,959 --> 00:22:35,917
but you got to play along here.
Heartfire?

575
00:22:37,458 --> 00:22:38,667
Where's the lemonade?

576
00:22:38,709 --> 00:22:40,333
Shh!

577
00:22:40,375 --> 00:22:43,250
<i>And as business slowed down...</i>

578
00:22:43,291 --> 00:22:44,291
Will you excuse me just one sec?

579
00:22:44,333 --> 00:22:45,834
<i>...Oscar had started being</i>

580
00:22:45,875 --> 00:22:48,417
<i>more independent</i>
<i>and harder to find.</i>

581
00:22:48,458 --> 00:22:50,250
(whispering):
Norman, have you seen Oscar?

582
00:22:50,291 --> 00:22:51,458
No, have you seen China Garden?

583
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:52,458
No.

584
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:53,792
Did you kill that armadillo?

585
00:22:53,834 --> 00:22:55,583
No, no, he's just under.

586
00:22:55,625 --> 00:22:58,542
If only we could use some of
his medicine for our own pain.

587
00:22:58,583 --> 00:23:02,458
Oh, wait, I've got
a full syringe in the car.

588
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:04,417
<i>And George Sr. would soon get</i>

589
00:23:04,458 --> 00:23:05,959
<i>worse economic news from</i>
<i>his attorney.</i>

590
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,417
GEORGE SR.:
<i>Oh, this can't be good.</i>

591
00:23:07,458 --> 00:23:08,792
<i>I mean, you didn't drive all</i>

592
00:23:08,834 --> 00:23:10,291
this distance for good news.

593
00:23:10,333 --> 00:23:11,875
You've got a balloon payment due

594
00:23:11,917 --> 00:23:13,750
on the mortgage
on this property.

595
00:23:13,792 --> 00:23:14,834
It's about $15 million.

596
00:23:14,875 --> 00:23:16,500
I mean, I-- what am I gonna do?

597
00:23:16,542 --> 00:23:18,208
Where am I gonna get that money?

598
00:23:18,250 --> 00:23:20,125
I thought you were going to sell
the land to the government

599
00:23:20,166 --> 00:23:21,417
to build the wall.

600
00:23:21,458 --> 00:23:22,959
Yeah, but that was put on hold.

601
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,917
So?
It's election time.

602
00:23:24,959 --> 00:23:27,917
Now's the time to get a
politician to push for the wall.

603
00:23:27,959 --> 00:23:30,583
Isn't that dizzy kook
Lucille Austero running?

604
00:23:30,625 --> 00:23:32,291
No, no, she,
she can't know about this.

605
00:23:32,333 --> 00:23:35,667
She's the majority owner
of my company,

606
00:23:35,709 --> 00:23:37,208
and besides,
she's so pro-immigrant.

607
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:38,834
NARRATOR:
<i>She was.</i>

608
00:23:38,875 --> 00:23:41,375
<i>She'd even taken in</i>
<i>a Latino foster child,</i>

609
00:23:41,417 --> 00:23:45,083
<i>which she denied was an attempt</i>
<i>to bring in the Hispanic vote.</i>

610
00:23:45,125 --> 00:23:47,375
<i>Nonetheless, she did know what</i>
<i>cultural buttons to push</i>

611
00:23:47,417 --> 00:23:49,291
<i>to win their hearts.</i>

612
00:23:49,333 --> 00:23:50,959
BARRY: Doesn't matter,
she's not going to win anyway.

613
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,583
The guy you want is the guy
she's running against--

614
00:23:53,625 --> 00:23:55,291
Herbert Love, right?

615
00:23:55,333 --> 00:23:56,583
He's got a rally tonight.

616
00:23:56,625 --> 00:23:58,041
Go and see him.

617
00:23:58,083 --> 00:24:00,834
Everyone knows how persuasive
you can be.

618
00:24:00,875 --> 00:24:02,333
Used to be.

619
00:24:02,375 --> 00:24:04,417
I'd be lucky to sell
a glass of lemonade

620
00:24:04,458 --> 00:24:06,000
for a thousand dollars today.

621
00:24:06,041 --> 00:24:07,000
Now, listen.

622
00:24:07,041 --> 00:24:09,041
If I can take no more

623
00:24:09,083 --> 00:24:11,875
than a law degree
from the Virgin Islands...

624
00:24:11,917 --> 00:24:14,417
-Yeah. -...a-a-and turn it
into a net worth

625
00:24:14,458 --> 00:24:17,458
of $750,000--

626
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:19,250
before, of course,
what I owe in lawsuits--

627
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:23,083
you can talk a politician into
wasting public funds on a wall.

628
00:24:23,125 --> 00:24:25,208
Wait, wait,
that rally is tonight?

629
00:24:25,250 --> 00:24:26,375
-Mm-hmm.
-But I'm supposed

630
00:24:26,417 --> 00:24:28,000
to meet my wife tonight,

631
00:24:28,041 --> 00:24:29,458
which I am dreading, by the way.

632
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:31,291
NARRATOR:
<i>One of the changes</i>

633
00:24:31,333 --> 00:24:33,250

<i>over the previous year...</i>

634
00:24:33,291 --> 00:24:35,834
-My right rear tire is low.
<i>-...was a decrease</i>

635
00:24:35,875 --> 00:24:39,917
<i>in the physical intimacy George</i>
<i>Sr. and his wife had enjoyed.</i>

636
00:24:39,959 --> 00:24:42,917
You're so ugly from behind.

637
00:24:45,375 --> 00:24:47,625
GEORGE SR.:<i> 'Cause if no one</i>
<i>shows up at that office,</i>

638
00:24:47,667 --> 00:24:49,500
she really will divorce me.

639
00:24:49,542 --> 00:24:51,041
BARRY:
Too bad you can't use a double.

640
00:24:51,083 --> 00:24:52,625
Oh, also I used a look-alike

641
00:24:52,667 --> 00:24:55,500
named Stewart to take
the California bar for me.

642
00:24:55,542 --> 00:24:56,792
But you knew that, right?

643
00:24:59,166 --> 00:25:01,083
-Oscar.
-NARRATOR:<i> And later,</i>

<i>finally found Oscar, who was</i>
<i>acting more like George.</i>

647
00:25:09,709 --> 00:25:10,667
Why aren't you sweating?

648
00:25:10,709 --> 00:25:12,792
Maybe I had a better offer.

649
00:25:12,834 --> 00:25:15,125
And not a word to Dr. Norman.

650
00:25:15,166 --> 00:25:17,125
He doesn't think
women should be awake for it.

651
00:25:17,166 --> 00:25:19,125
-"Oh, great Dr. Norman."
-(chuckles)

652
00:25:19,166 --> 00:25:22,000
You know, we have
to be very careful.

653
00:25:22,041 --> 00:25:24,166
Oscar, we are trying
to help people here.

654
00:25:24,208 --> 00:25:26,375
I know, I know, I know,
but you know what?

655
00:25:26,417 --> 00:25:30,250
It just gets hot
in there sometimes!

656
00:25:30,291 --> 00:25:33,000
Whoa, we don't,
we don't have to yell.

657
00:25:33,041 --> 00:25:36,792
Why not you go do hot sweat,
let Oscar do squeeze?

658
00:25:36,834 --> 00:25:38,625
All right, I mean,
I'm not saying that.

659
00:25:38,667 --> 00:25:41,375
I just, uh, I need a break.

660
00:25:41,417 --> 00:25:43,166
I just can't go on

...in a, in a 100-degree mud hut
for an hour and a half.

I am begging you--
there has to be something else

664
00:25:53,125 --> 00:25:56,125
I can impersonate you doing.

665
00:25:58,667 --> 00:26:00,250
It's funny you should say that

666
00:26:00,291 --> 00:26:04,583
because, uh, if you're okay
with the sitting silently part,

667
00:26:04,625 --> 00:26:06,542
I have something for you
that's quite chilling.

-Thank you. 
-NARRATOR:<i> And so</i>

It's, it's directly uphill

00:26:31,041 --> 00:26:32,750
(both laugh)

680
00:26:32,792 --> 00:26:35,333
Yeah, wha-what wall?

681
00:26:35,375 --> 00:26:36,333
(gasps)

682
00:26:36,375 --> 00:26:37,959
Very good, George.

683
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,667
We got to be careful
where we talk about this.

684
00:26:40,709 --> 00:26:42,750
Ooh, I got to watch my words.

685
00:26:42,792 --> 00:26:45,417
<i>And that's when</i>
<i>Oscar realized that George Sr.</i>

686
00:26:45,458 --> 00:26:47,125
<i>didn't buy the land</i>

687
00:26:47,166 --> 00:26:51,125
<i>to be the best brother</i>
<i>in Southern California.</i>

688
00:26:53,917 --> 00:26:58,125
<i>We 12 publishes</i>
<i>a rare retraction.</i>

689
00:26:58,166 --> 00:27:01,291
<i>Oscar confirms his suspicions</i>
<i>of the wall</i>

690
00:27:01,333 --> 00:27:02,542
<i>while impersonating George Sr.</i>

691
00:27:02,583 --> 00:27:04,291
I thought we...
(clears throat)

692
00:27:04,333 --> 00:27:06,333
(deeper voice): I thought
we could talk about the wall.

693
00:27:07,417 --> 00:27:09,792
You know, the wall.

694
00:27:09,834 --> 00:27:11,583
Have you baked your brain
in that pizza oven,

695
00:27:11,625 --> 00:27:13,291
or is senility your backup plan

696
00:27:13,333 --> 00:27:15,875
if we can't get the government
to buy the property?

697
00:27:15,917 --> 00:27:18,709
(gasps) So we only<i> did</i> buy
that land for personal gain.

698
00:27:18,750 --> 00:27:21,709
(laughing): Well,
what Oscar does-doesn't know

699
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:22,959
won't hurt him.

700
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,333
(chuckling):
Oscar.

701
00:27:24,375 --> 00:27:25,417
NARRATOR:
<i>And although it wasn't</i>

702
00:27:25,458 --> 00:27:27,041
<i>a perfect impersonation...</i>

703
00:27:27,083 --> 00:27:28,875
I love it when you call my name.

704
00:27:28,917 --> 00:27:30,125
<i>...he did have the maca root.</i>

705
00:27:30,166 --> 00:27:32,125
(gasps)
George!

706
00:27:32,166 --> 00:27:33,208
Don't call me that.

707
00:27:35,291 --> 00:27:37,750
Call me Father B.
