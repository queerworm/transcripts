00:00:19,477 --> 00:00:21,604
[narrator] <i>George Michael's</i>
<i>relationship with Rebel</i>

2
00:00:21,688 --> 00:00:23,815
<i>began under false pretenses...</i>

3
00:00:23,982 --> 00:00:25,734
How does your privacy software work?

4
00:00:25,817 --> 00:00:27,068
It's private.

5
00:00:27,152 --> 00:00:28,486
<i>...and a false name.</i>

6
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:30,155
George Mi-- Harris.

7
00:00:30,238 --> 00:00:31,906
<i>Rebel would soon unwittingly</i>

8
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:33,908
<i>be dating George Michael's father...</i>

9
00:00:33,992 --> 00:00:35,493
I just put your name in for something.

10
00:00:35,577 --> 00:00:38,163
<i>...who was also operating</i>
<i>under false pretenses</i>

11
00:00:38,246 --> 00:00:40,707
<i>as the producer of a movie</i>
<i>about his family</i>

12
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:42,208
<i>he didn't have the rights for.</i>

13
00:00:42,292 --> 00:00:45,295
It might not even happen
because I don't think I can ask my son.

14
00:00:45,378 --> 00:00:47,756
What happened between him and me
was very disappointing.

15
00:00:48,465 --> 00:00:51,676
<i>As he'd been unexpectedly voted</i>
<i>out of his son's dorm...</i>

16
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:55,305
<i>-and forced to find a new home.</i>
-[wand beeps]

17
00:00:55,889 --> 00:00:58,516
-You take it.
-But you've got nothing in your luggage.

18
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,310
I wasn't supposed to
be traveling today.

19
00:01:00,393 --> 00:01:02,145
It was voting,
there was a miscalculation.

20
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:04,272
Obviously, P-Hound's gonna
vote against you.

21
00:01:04,355 --> 00:01:07,275
<i>So, it was Gob who asked George Michael</i>

22
00:01:07,358 --> 00:01:08,359
<i>to meet his father...</i>

23
00:01:09,235 --> 00:01:12,739
<i>...while he too was operating</i>
<i>under false pretenses.</i>

24
00:01:12,822 --> 00:01:15,408
I'm trying to lock this guy Tony
into this gay magic trick,

25
00:01:15,492 --> 00:01:17,494
and I just needed believable arm candy.

26
00:01:18,703 --> 00:01:21,039
<i>But the deception caused Michael to think</i>

27
00:01:21,122 --> 00:01:22,624
<i>Gob was his rival.</i>

28
00:01:22,707 --> 00:01:23,833
Rebel Alley. Where is she?

29
00:01:24,417 --> 00:01:27,170
<i>And an out of control Michael</i>
<i>fought with his brother</i>

30
00:01:27,337 --> 00:01:29,130
<i>even though he'd done nothing wrong.</i>

31
00:01:29,214 --> 00:01:30,924
I filled all your houses.

32
00:01:31,007 --> 00:01:31,841
With who?

33
00:01:33,051 --> 00:01:34,094
With sex offenders.

34
00:01:34,177 --> 00:01:36,513
<i>...or at the very most, one thing wrong.</i>

35
00:01:36,679 --> 00:01:38,640
<i>But, in fact, it was George Michael</i>

36
00:01:38,723 --> 00:01:41,684
<i>in his alter ego as George Maharis</i>

37
00:01:41,768 --> 00:01:44,938
<i>who has become Michael's</i>
<i>actual rival for Rebel.</i>

38
00:01:45,021 --> 00:01:47,148
What if I told you that he and I
were twins?

39
00:01:47,232 --> 00:01:50,527
<i>Although twins turned out to be</i>
<i>an apt description.</i>

40
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:53,029
<i>Ironically, the UCI housing office</i>

41
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:55,782
<i>also thought George Michael was a twin.</i>

42
00:01:55,865 --> 00:01:56,699
They're twins, ugly.

43
00:01:56,783 --> 00:01:58,535
We should sign them up for twin club.

44
00:01:58,618 --> 00:02:02,539
<i>And while those false pretenses</i>
<i>made it hard to be on campus...</i>

45
00:02:03,581 --> 00:02:05,583
<i>it did get him a pretty cool room.</i>

46
00:02:07,001 --> 00:02:10,505
<i>George Michael Bluth had</i>
<i>never been more popular.</i>

47
00:02:11,339 --> 00:02:14,384
<i>He was surrounded by people</i>
<i>thrilled to be in his company.</i>

48
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:15,593
They're out of root beer.

49
00:02:15,677 --> 00:02:17,762
So I got you one with the last bit
of root beer

50
00:02:17,846 --> 00:02:19,430
because I remember
somebody was saying,

51
00:02:19,514 --> 00:02:20,890
George Michael likes root beer.

52
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:23,268
<i>And as his business</i>
<i>was taking off...</i>

53
00:02:23,351 --> 00:02:24,269
Thanks a lot.

54
00:02:24,352 --> 00:02:25,728
You guys don't have to do all this.

55
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:27,856
This was just a little
get-together for my girlfriend

56
00:02:27,939 --> 00:02:29,065
to show her I'm doing well.

57
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:30,275
<i>...so was his romantic life.</i>

58
00:02:30,358 --> 00:02:32,193
Hey, stop it!

59
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:34,696
That was the last
root beer snow cone.

60
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:36,364
I got that for him, Carlos.

61
00:02:36,447 --> 00:02:38,408
Teach you for being
such a kiss-ass, Terry.

62
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,702
And it was an ex-Bluth employee

63
00:02:40,785 --> 00:02:43,329
who was the most grateful to be
in his company.

64
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:45,123
-Want any of these?
-No, I'm fine.

65
00:02:45,206 --> 00:02:47,458
You know, I really appreciate
you guys doing all this.

66
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:49,335
I just wish I understood...

67
00:02:50,253 --> 00:02:51,087
why?

68
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:52,005
That's why!

69
00:02:52,088 --> 00:02:54,257
Because you could ask us
why we do this,

70
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:55,258
and mean it.

71
00:02:55,383 --> 00:02:58,178
The fact that you could be so
down to earth...

72
00:02:58,386 --> 00:02:59,637
And look so young.

73
00:02:59,762 --> 00:03:01,848
...while you're
starting this giant company.

74
00:03:01,931 --> 00:03:03,850
You've created an opportunity many of us

75
00:03:03,933 --> 00:03:05,518
thought we'd never have again.

76
00:03:07,687 --> 00:03:09,814
See, that's the part
I don't understand, Carlos.

77
00:03:09,898 --> 00:03:11,774
-You know my name!
-What's his name?

78
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:12,984
You're the kiss-ass, Carlos.

79
00:03:13,067 --> 00:03:14,569
Guys, I'm gonna learn all your names.

80
00:03:14,652 --> 00:03:15,904
-I promise.
-George.

81
00:03:15,987 --> 00:03:19,032
<i>And that's when he heard</i>
<i>what had become his name.</i>

82
00:03:19,115 --> 00:03:20,950
-What is all this?
-It's just a little surprise.

83
00:03:21,242 --> 00:03:22,827
-You did this for me?
-Yes!

84
00:03:22,952 --> 00:03:24,996
Well, they did it for me,

85
00:03:25,121 --> 00:03:27,540
but only because they knew
I wanted to do something for you.

86
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:30,043
Maybe we could talk
without your friends.

87
00:03:30,501 --> 00:03:31,920
These guys aren't really my friends.

88
00:03:32,003 --> 00:03:33,004
I barely know their names.

89
00:03:33,671 --> 00:03:35,089
I mean, I know Carlos, but...

90
00:03:35,173 --> 00:03:37,634
only because of that old song,
"Carlos the Tickle Monster."

91
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:39,177
Wait, what song is that?

92
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:41,137
God, I knew he made that up.

93
00:03:41,804 --> 00:03:42,972
But it did
help me remember.

94
00:03:43,473 --> 00:03:46,309
Don't worry about these guys.
They're not listening to a word.

95
00:03:46,392 --> 00:03:47,518
How about that kiss?

96
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:48,770
We need to talk.

97
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:51,731
[all] Ooh.

98
00:03:52,523 --> 00:03:54,734
{\an8}<i>Now the story of what happened</i>

99
00:03:54,817 --> 00:03:58,112
{\an8}<i>when the one man who was</i>
<i>holding his family together</i>

100
00:03:58,196 --> 00:03:59,948
<i>finally let go,</i>

101
00:04:00,156 --> 00:04:03,326
<i>and the separate journeys that eventually</i>
<i>gave them no choice</i>

102
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:05,286
<i>but to come back together.</i>

103
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:08,831
{\an8}<i>It's </i>Arrested Development:
Fateful Consequences.

104
00:04:15,713 --> 00:04:17,215
<i>Months before the party,</i>

105
00:04:17,298 --> 00:04:20,093
<i>George Michael was</i>
<i>readying his dorm room for Rebel.</i>

106
00:04:20,343 --> 00:04:22,595
-Look, I got us a peace pizza.
-That's great.

107
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:24,555
-You gotta go.
-What'd you do with my stuff?

108
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:25,974
I've got a girl coming over...

109
00:04:26,057 --> 00:04:27,600
<i>Yet he still wasn't ready to let go...</i>

110
00:04:27,684 --> 00:04:29,477
<i>-...of Maeby.</i>
-It's not Maeby, no. But...

111
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:32,105
{\an8}You have to stay away,
She's already trying to startÂ Fakeblock,

112
00:04:32,188 --> 00:04:35,275
-and I'm trying to stop her.
-You can't. It's our company.

113
00:04:35,358 --> 00:04:37,318
-But it's not real.
-Could you please leave?

114
00:04:38,027 --> 00:04:42,156
{\an8}First you "F" me with Fakeblock, and then
kick me out when you have a hottie coming?

115
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,616
{\an8}-I have roommate rights.
-You know what?

116
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:46,703
{\an8}You voided your rights when you took
this picture of Maeby brushing her teeth.

117
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:49,247
-Not against the rules.
-Still a little weird.

118
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:50,373
But not against the rules.

119
00:04:50,456 --> 00:04:51,332
-Well...

120
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:53,084
Know what?
This is no longer a peace pizza.

121
00:04:53,251 --> 00:04:54,544
{\an8}That is a war pizza.

122
00:04:54,627 --> 00:04:55,628
{\an8}Okay, that's fine.

123
00:04:55,712 --> 00:04:57,213
Enjoy your war pizza.

124
00:04:57,797 --> 00:04:59,465
<i>The pizza hadn't even cooled</i>

125
00:04:59,549 --> 00:05:03,052
<i>before George Michael had officially</i>
<i>gotten over Maeby.</i>

126
00:05:03,261 --> 00:05:05,513
Thanks for keeping
it down for my RA.

127
00:05:06,556 --> 00:05:07,849
{\an8}You were keeping it down, right?

128
00:05:07,932 --> 00:05:09,767
{\an8}You know what really
impresses me about you?

129
00:05:09,851 --> 00:05:11,728
{\an8}How little you try to impress me.

130
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:14,105
{\an8}I aim to not please.

131
00:05:14,397 --> 00:05:16,232
{\an8}I just came from a dinner

132
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:18,192
{\an8}with this right-wing politician

133
00:05:18,276 --> 00:05:20,528
{\an8}and his date,
who was an actual hooker.

134
00:05:20,611 --> 00:05:23,323
{\an8}-They sound like terrible people.
-They were.

135
00:05:23,406 --> 00:05:26,659
{\an8}So, wait, is this where
you conceived Fakeblock?

136
00:05:27,243 --> 00:05:29,370
<i>It was George Michael's first chance</i>

137
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:31,080
<i>to truly be unpretentious</i>

138
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:32,874
<i>and undo the big lie.</i>

139
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:34,459
{\an8}<i>On the other hand,</i>

140
00:05:34,542 --> 00:05:35,418
{\an8}<i>she thought he was</i>

141
00:05:35,501 --> 00:05:37,420
{\an8}<i>an unpretentious software genius.</i>

142
00:05:37,712 --> 00:05:38,796
{\an8}<i>If she were to learn</i>

143
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,049
{\an8}<i>that he was merely</i>
<i>a wood block player</i>

144
00:05:41,132 --> 00:05:43,801
{\an8}<i>with a heightened ability</i>
<i>to track the passage of time,</i>

145
00:05:44,427 --> 00:05:46,012
{\an8}<i>perhaps she would rightly feel</i>

146
00:05:46,095 --> 00:05:48,264
{\an8}<i>lack of pretension should be a given.</i>

147
00:05:48,598 --> 00:05:51,934
{\an8}<i>It was after second</i>
<i>23 that he said...</i>

148
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:55,313
{\an8}Yes, it was right in here.

149
00:05:55,396 --> 00:05:56,481
{\an8}-Wow.
-Yeah.

150
00:05:56,981 --> 00:05:59,067
{\an8}This is like making love
with the Wright brothers

151
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:00,485
{\an8}in their bicycle shop.

152
00:06:00,777 --> 00:06:02,278
<i>I'm sure she just</i>
<i>meant one of them.</i>

153
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:05,073
<i>Hey, how about her knowing</i>
<i>they had a bicycle shop?</i>

154
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:06,324
A little token...

155
00:06:06,407 --> 00:06:07,742
<i>And the next morning...</i>

156
00:06:10,328 --> 00:06:11,954
Listen, I got to go shoot a PSA.

157
00:06:12,121 --> 00:06:13,539
I'll text you from the car.

158
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:15,333
No, don't...

159
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:17,210
-Action.
-Tweet and drive.

160
00:06:17,335 --> 00:06:19,253
Yeah, that was good,
but it's "text."

161
00:06:19,337 --> 00:06:20,713
And we need the word "don't."

162
00:06:20,922 --> 00:06:23,132
[man] Don't Tweet and Drive PSA, take 19.

163
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:24,801
Don't make me do another one, Ron.

164
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:26,344
Did we get that?
That was a don't.

165
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:28,638
<i>But upon returning to his dorm,</i>

166
00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:30,056
<i>George Michael discovered that</i>

167
00:06:30,139 --> 00:06:32,809
<i>P-Hound had officially filed a grievance</i>

168
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:34,185
<i>with the Student Housing office.</i>

169
00:06:34,268 --> 00:06:36,646
So P-Hound claims that George Michael...

170
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:39,148
Make a note of that,
that's one person.

171
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:40,358
I know.

172
00:06:40,483 --> 00:06:43,277
Messed with his stuff
and stole some software thing?

173
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:47,156
Yeah, and George Michael claims
that nobody can live with P-Hound.

174
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,908
Somebody's got to go.

175
00:06:48,991 --> 00:06:50,284
It's time for a vote.

176
00:06:50,368 --> 00:06:51,702
We'll each get one vote.

177
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,413
That doesn't really seem fair,

178
00:06:53,538 --> 00:06:55,665
{\an8}you guys are obviously
gonna vote for the same person.

179
00:06:55,748 --> 00:06:58,501
{\an8}Right, because we're twins,

180
00:06:58,584 --> 00:07:00,586
{\an8}and we have no sense of ourselves
as individuals.

181
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:01,629
{\an8}That's right.

182
00:07:01,712 --> 00:07:04,340
{\an8}Fine. We'll each get a half vote.

183
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:07,510
<i>And the four men cast their three votes.</i>

184
00:07:07,593 --> 00:07:08,594
It's a tie...

185
00:07:09,303 --> 00:07:11,097
One and a half
to one and a half.

186
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:14,517
<i>The twins were proud to show that</i>
<i>they voted differently from one another.</i>

187
00:07:15,351 --> 00:07:17,228
We're gonna need a tie-breaker, ugly.

188
00:07:17,645 --> 00:07:19,147
<i>Fortunately, they were able</i>

189
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:21,190
<i>to bring in two more half votes.</i>

190
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:23,317
-It's a tie. Two to two.
<i>-...who also proved...</i>

191
00:07:23,401 --> 00:07:25,736
<i>...they were capable</i>
<i>of having opposite opinions.</i>

192
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:27,989
-Double tie! Yeah!
-Yeah!

193
00:07:28,156 --> 00:07:29,490
<i>To break the tie,</i>

194
00:07:29,574 --> 00:07:31,993
<i>more members of Twin Club</i>
<i>joined the electorate.</i>

195
00:07:32,076 --> 00:07:33,619
A quadruple tie!

196
00:07:33,828 --> 00:07:35,455
<i>Which also jammed up the works.</i>

197
00:07:35,538 --> 00:07:36,998
-Yeah!
-Yeah! Go.

198
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:40,001
Maybe we should just bring in
a single person now.

199
00:07:41,043 --> 00:07:43,296
You mean, like, not a twin?

200
00:07:43,504 --> 00:07:44,839
Just to speed things along.

201
00:07:45,047 --> 00:07:46,674
<i>And perhaps it was that comment...</i>

202
00:07:46,757 --> 00:07:48,926
I guess one head's better than two.
Twin hater.

203
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:51,804
We've been dealing with twincists
like you all our lives.

204
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:55,558
<i>...that united the voting body</i>
<i>into a greater cause</i>

205
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:57,602
<i>than expressing their individuality.</i>

206
00:07:57,727 --> 00:07:59,896
<i>And with the exception</i>
<i>of George Michael's vote...</i>

207
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:01,189
P-Hound

208
00:08:01,355 --> 00:08:04,484
George Michael. George Michael.
George Michael.

209
00:08:04,817 --> 00:08:06,611
George Michael.
George Michael.

210
00:08:07,528 --> 00:08:08,362
George Michael...

211
00:08:08,446 --> 00:08:10,698
<i>-...and one other curiosity...</i>
-Bender from <i>Futurama.</i>

212
00:08:10,823 --> 00:08:11,949
I almost wrote that.

213
00:08:12,074 --> 00:08:14,327
<i>...it was a George Michael blitz.</i>

214
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:16,662
George Michael and...

215
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:18,372
a half vote for
"George Michael, twincist."

216
00:08:18,456 --> 00:08:19,999
See you later, twin hater.

217
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:21,751
I'm not...

218
00:08:29,967 --> 00:08:31,761
<i>And that's when he ran into...</i>

219
00:08:31,844 --> 00:08:33,471
-[horn honks]
<i>-...his beeping uncle.</i>

220
00:08:33,554 --> 00:08:34,847
Uncle Gob, what are you doing?

221
00:08:35,973 --> 00:08:39,143
I was in the neighborhood. I happened
to remember how much you love bologna.

222
00:08:39,227 --> 00:08:41,062
So, yeah, I just...
I found this great ShopRite

223
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:43,314
and I thought, "You know who's
got to have a taste,

224
00:08:43,439 --> 00:08:45,024
is young George Michael."

225
00:08:45,107 --> 00:08:48,069
<i>He didn't think George Michael</i>
<i>liked bologna.</i>

226
00:08:48,486 --> 00:08:51,322
<i>He was trying to</i>
<i>correct a bad impression</i>

227
00:08:51,405 --> 00:08:54,450
<i>he felt he might have made</i>
<i>with his nephew a few nights earlier.</i>

228
00:08:55,451 --> 00:08:57,161
My God, Uncle Gob,
what is this?

229
00:08:57,245 --> 00:08:59,413
Can't lie to you, George Michael.
It's a forget me now.

230
00:08:59,497 --> 00:09:02,959
I wanted you to forget
what happened at that magic club.

231
00:09:03,834 --> 00:09:04,752
I was embarrassed.

232
00:09:05,002 --> 00:09:07,338
If you don't want me
to tell anyone about it, I won't.

233
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:09,799
I'm such a fool.

234
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:11,676
I go to those things too quickly.

235
00:09:12,134 --> 00:09:16,222
Really, it's just the age we live in.
Take a pill to forget your problems.

236
00:09:16,347 --> 00:09:17,932
Take a pill to go to sleep.

237
00:09:18,099 --> 00:09:19,767
And take a pill to
forget your problems.

238
00:09:20,017 --> 00:09:21,936
Need an erection, take a pill.

239
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:23,646
Need to forget your problems,
take a pill.

240
00:09:23,729 --> 00:09:25,606
Take a pill and your
problems are forgotten.

241
00:09:25,856 --> 00:09:26,774
Take a pill.

242
00:09:26,857 --> 00:09:28,568
What an age we live in.
It's great, isn't it?

243
00:09:30,319 --> 00:09:31,571
What's with the suitcase.

244
00:09:31,862 --> 00:09:33,281
I got kicked out of my dorm.

245
00:09:34,615 --> 00:09:35,616
That was a freebie.

246
00:09:36,617 --> 00:09:38,244
You in the market to buy a house?

247
00:09:38,327 --> 00:09:39,620
It's a great time to buy.

248
00:09:39,704 --> 00:09:42,039
I don't want to buy a house.
I don't have that kind of money.

249
00:09:42,164 --> 00:09:44,750
Money? Ninja, please.
You don't need money.

250
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:46,419
With that Fakeblock
thing you got going

251
00:09:46,502 --> 00:09:47,837
and your great credit rating,

252
00:09:47,962 --> 00:09:49,463
we can put you in
a Bluth in no time.

253
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:51,465
<i>Frankly, it wasn't the kind of risk</i>

254
00:09:51,549 --> 00:09:53,134
<i>George Michael would take.</i>

255
00:09:53,384 --> 00:09:56,512
<i>But then Gob said something</i>
<i>that changed his mind.</i>

256
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:58,055
Plus, it would make
your dad proud.

257
00:09:58,347 --> 00:10:02,018
I know that he's still really
disappointed about you...

258
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:04,353
-That I blew him off?
-Blew him off.

259
00:10:04,687 --> 00:10:06,689
Boy, is he disappointed about that.

260
00:10:07,398 --> 00:10:09,525
-I would love to say yes...
-Yes! There it is!

261
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:11,652
I got my much-vaunted yes!

262
00:10:11,736 --> 00:10:13,029
<i>Gob felt good.</i>

263
00:10:13,112 --> 00:10:15,489
<i>He would be able to</i>
<i>prove to his brother</i>

264
00:10:15,573 --> 00:10:17,283
<i>that he could actually sell a house.</i>

265
00:10:17,658 --> 00:10:20,745
<i>George Michael felt good,</i>
<i>because he could prove to his father</i>

266
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:22,830
<i>that he didÂ indeed support him.</i>

267
00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:25,958
<i>And the residents</i>
<i>of Sudden Valley felt good,</i>

268
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:27,251
<i>because it turns out,</i>

269
00:10:27,376 --> 00:10:28,711
<i>the very young-looking man</i>

270
00:10:28,794 --> 00:10:31,047
<i>who drove down their street</i>
<i>that afternoon...</i>

271
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:32,590
Hello, young man.

272
00:10:33,341 --> 00:10:34,216
How young are you?

273
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:35,593
I'm good. How you doing?

274
00:10:35,676 --> 00:10:36,927
No, how young are you?

275
00:10:37,011 --> 00:10:38,512
I'm 22.

276
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:41,557
<i>...was over 21,and they wouldn't</i>
<i>have to search</i>

277
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:43,976
<i>for a home that</i>
<i>was even more remote.</i>

278
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:47,271
He's 22, but looks 16.

279
00:10:52,568 --> 00:10:55,196
<i>The Sudden Valley residents</i>
<i>wasted no time</i>

280
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:57,573

281
00:10:57,657 --> 00:10:59,158
...welcome you to the neighborhood.

00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:01,869

<i>...every chance they got.</i>

284
00:11:03,954 --> 00:11:05,581
It's so nice.

285
00:11:05,748 --> 00:11:07,083
It's my birthday.

286
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:08,876
It's everyone's birthday.

287
00:11:10,419 --> 00:11:12,213
I wonder who this is from.

288
00:11:12,421 --> 00:11:13,798
We said no clothes, Carlos.

289
00:11:13,881 --> 00:11:14,924
A hat is not clothes.

290
00:11:15,049 --> 00:11:16,384
A hat is clothes.

291
00:11:16,467 --> 00:11:17,968
I wish I had something to offer you.

292
00:11:18,219 --> 00:11:19,720
Here you are, guests in my home,

293
00:11:19,804 --> 00:11:21,347
and you've gotten me
beautiful gifts.

294
00:11:21,931 --> 00:11:23,808
Feels like it should be
the other way around.

295
00:11:25,476 --> 00:11:26,435
[man] Football!

296
00:11:27,853 --> 00:11:31,023
<i>And it was during an impromptu</i>
<i>touch football game...</i>

297
00:11:32,441 --> 00:11:34,193
No, guys the play is dead.
The play is dead.

298
00:11:34,276 --> 00:11:36,487
Maybe we can't play skins versus skins.

299
00:11:36,612 --> 00:11:37,905
Tops versus bottoms?

300
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:41,033
<i>...that the idea of a party</i>
<i>for his girlfriend came up.</i>

301
00:11:41,242 --> 00:11:43,244
Let's throw her a party,
Sudden Valley style.

302
00:11:43,327 --> 00:11:46,414
<i>And while George Michael was building</i>
<i>new relationships...</i>

303
00:11:46,497 --> 00:11:48,541
...privacy on the web, until now.

304
00:11:48,624 --> 00:11:50,626
<i>Maeby was building his new business</i>

305

<i>her self-esteem growing every day.</i>

307
00:11:57,967 --> 00:12:01,053
<i>Over the following days,</i>
<i>Maeby was able to</i>

308
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:03,848
<i>discreetly bring in</i>
<i>cash from Herbert Love</i>

309
00:12:04,098 --> 00:12:07,226
<i>for services she got her mother</i>
<i>to unknowingly render.</i>

310
00:12:07,309 --> 00:12:09,562
Why don't you take him out to dinner?

311
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:12,022
<i>-Put it on the family tab.</i>
-Of course.

312
00:12:12,106 --> 00:12:14,650
<i>This high school senior was</i>
<i>working several jobs</i>

313
00:12:14,775 --> 00:12:15,818
We have to be discreet.

314
00:12:15,901 --> 00:12:17,319
<i>And she did her jobs well.</i>

315
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:18,446
-What?
-Discreet!

316
00:12:18,529 --> 00:12:20,990
<i>She even started a Fakeblock office,</i>

317
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:24,994
<i>after trading shares to a new</i>
<i>silent partner for George Michael.</i>

318
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:26,245
Stock options?

319
00:12:26,328 --> 00:12:29,957
<i>The shares turned out to be</i>
<i>useful for a lot of things.</i>

320
00:12:33,711 --> 00:12:34,754
-Hey.
-Hi.

321
00:12:34,837 --> 00:12:36,213
You rented a little office.

322
00:12:36,297 --> 00:12:38,466
I don't want you to see it yet.
Still setting it up...

323
00:12:38,549 --> 00:12:40,468
with a little help
from a wealthy benefactor,

324
00:12:40,551 --> 00:12:41,385
Lucille Two.

325
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:43,637
-Gangie.
-No, Lucille Two.

326
00:12:44,138 --> 00:12:44,972
Austero?

327
00:12:45,055 --> 00:12:47,683
-I don't know who that is.
-You don't?

328
00:12:48,809 --> 00:12:49,852
Never met the woman.

329
00:12:50,853 --> 00:12:52,897
She'll be the one driving
the stair car from now on.

330
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:55,107
-It was part of the deal.
-You gave her my car?

331
00:12:55,191 --> 00:12:57,568
It's technically hers anyways,
because of the Bluth Company.

332
00:12:57,735 --> 00:13:00,946
But I did get you her
1988 yellow Cadillac.

333
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:03,449
She only uses it to
and from hip replacements.

334
00:13:05,659 --> 00:13:08,204
I guess that's only funny if you know
who she is.

335
00:13:08,579 --> 00:13:11,332
<i>And so, George Michael</i>
<i>was proud to invite Rebel</i>

336
00:13:11,415 --> 00:13:14,585
<i>to see how successful</i>
<i>George Maharis had become.</i>

337
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:17,922
<i>and how many people</i>
<i>were eager to be in his company.</i>

338
00:13:18,088 --> 00:13:19,799
No, I'm fine.
He was tickling me in there.

339
00:13:19,882 --> 00:13:22,134
-What is all this?
-Just a little surprise.

340
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:23,511
-You did this for me?
-Yes.

341
00:13:23,594 --> 00:13:25,638
<i>-But Rebel had other concerns.</i>
-We need to talk.

342
00:13:25,721 --> 00:13:27,723
[all] Ooh.

343
00:13:28,599 --> 00:13:29,475
This is it.

344
00:13:30,184 --> 00:13:31,268
This is the place.

345
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:33,729
Hope you don't find
it too pretentious.

346
00:13:34,146 --> 00:13:36,732
Well, what happened to the old
"anything goes in the dorm"?

347
00:13:37,441 --> 00:13:40,402
Well, I got this place instead.
You know, I guess I wanted to impress you.

348
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:42,279
I'm gonna getÂ furniture, obviously.

349
00:13:42,363 --> 00:13:44,073
The guys from Homefill
are coming this week.

350
00:13:44,198 --> 00:13:45,783
That's not the problem.

351
00:13:45,866 --> 00:13:47,243
No, that's not the problem.

352
00:13:48,452 --> 00:13:49,829
Wrong house, buddy.

353
00:13:49,954 --> 00:13:52,331
No, this is my son,
Lem Depardieu.

354
00:13:52,957 --> 00:13:53,833
-Hey, baby.
-Hi.

355
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:55,084
Jacqueline still in the car?

356
00:13:55,459 --> 00:13:56,752
You have a son?

357
00:13:57,419 --> 00:13:59,296
-Yeah.
-Hey, Lem.

358
00:13:59,421 --> 00:14:00,464
-Hi.
-How you doing?

359
00:14:00,548 --> 00:14:02,174
I love kids.Â You want a Twister?

360
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:04,218
I was given four Twisters.
You should take one.

361
00:14:04,301 --> 00:14:06,262
-Take a Twister.
-You know what, honey?

362
00:14:06,887 --> 00:14:07,888
Do you want to give Mommy

363
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:10,099
some alone time with her friend?

364
00:14:10,182 --> 00:14:11,684
-Maybe he could play in the pool.
-Yeah.

365
00:14:11,809 --> 00:14:13,644
He'll be safe.
There's a hundred guys there.

366
00:14:13,727 --> 00:14:16,188
-Make sure you wear your sunblock.
-Okay.

367
00:14:16,272 --> 00:14:19,400
<i>In fact, it was the folks in the pool</i>
<i>who were more at risk</i>

368
00:14:19,483 --> 00:14:20,943
<i>of being near Lem</i>

369
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:22,945
<i>than he was of them.</i>

370
00:14:28,659 --> 00:14:29,869
Wow, what a great kid.

371
00:14:29,994 --> 00:14:33,330
You know, when I said
I was not eager to have kids,

372
00:14:33,414 --> 00:14:35,124
but I think it's
great that you have a son.

373
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:36,917
I have a spare room here

374
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:38,294
that the two of
you could stay in.

375
00:14:39,003 --> 00:14:40,421
Or maybe you
could just stay in it.

376
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:43,340
He doesn't live with me.
He lives in France with his father.

377
00:14:43,424 --> 00:14:46,051
He just visits March and April
during French pilot season.

378
00:14:46,135 --> 00:14:47,636
But that's what I'm talking about.

379
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,555
I just don't want to get that serious.

380
00:14:50,014 --> 00:14:51,515
Because you're seeing someone else?

381
00:14:51,599 --> 00:14:53,309
No! I mean, yes,

382
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:54,768
I'm seeing someone else,

383
00:14:54,852 --> 00:14:56,937
but I don't want to get
serious with him, either,

384
00:14:57,021 --> 00:14:58,856
and you're telling people
in the neighborhood

385
00:14:58,939 --> 00:15:00,065
that we're seeing each other.

386
00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:02,109
What happened to the guy
who founded Fakeblock?

387
00:15:02,192 --> 00:15:03,611
The guy who keeps things anonymous?

388
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:05,404
I can do anonymous.

389
00:15:05,487 --> 00:15:06,906
I'm all about staying anonymous.

390
00:15:06,989 --> 00:15:08,616
That's Fakeblock's mission statement.

391
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:11,035
And now you're asking Lem and me
to move into this house,

392
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,078
and it just seems all backwards.

393
00:15:14,663 --> 00:15:15,497
Sorry.

394
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:20,794
Maybe it is backwards.

395
00:15:24,465 --> 00:15:25,466
[tile shatters]

396
00:15:26,842 --> 00:15:29,261
<i>George Michael shared</i>
<i>his relationship problem</i>

397
00:15:29,345 --> 00:15:33,015
<i>with the one other woman</i>
<i>he'd had a relationship problem with.</i>

398
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:34,934
-That's ridiculous.
-Right.

399
00:15:35,017 --> 00:15:36,769
You haven't told her
your real name, have you?

400
00:15:36,852 --> 00:15:39,396
What? No, no. No, she still
thinks I'm George Maharis.

401
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,273
But she's dating another guy,

402
00:15:41,398 --> 00:15:43,025
which is probably the whole reason

403
00:15:43,108 --> 00:15:44,902
she's always saying
I'm moving too fast.

404
00:15:44,985 --> 00:15:46,820
I take things too seriously.

405
00:15:47,404 --> 00:15:48,989
I take things too serious.

406
00:15:49,531 --> 00:15:51,033
I take things too seriously.

407
00:15:51,158 --> 00:15:52,910
I need to note which one of
those is correct,

408
00:15:52,993 --> 00:15:55,829
because I sound like a horse's ass
when I alternate between the two.

409
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:57,623
I need to get my [bleep] together.

410
00:15:57,706 --> 00:15:59,458
But the point is that I take things...

411
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:01,710
easily-breezily.

412
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:03,921
Well, a real serioush woman

413
00:16:04,546 --> 00:16:06,966
knows what she wants
and moves quickly.

414
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:08,217
"Serioush" is nothing.

415
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:09,134
That's not a word.

416
00:16:09,218 --> 00:16:10,552
Are you ready to see your office?

417
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:12,596
I have been. It's great.
I like it a lot.

418
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:14,306
I wonder if she's gonna think

419
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:16,684
we've been a little
lavish with money.

420
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:19,103
You know, is it too much?
But then to contradict myself,

421
00:16:19,186 --> 00:16:22,147
I do think, at some point,
it would be good to get a second chair

422
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:24,608
just in case we have a guest,
but I'm thinking big picture.

423
00:16:24,692 --> 00:16:26,110
Buddy, this isn't your office.

424
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:27,987
She's over here.

425
00:16:35,369 --> 00:16:36,245
Welcome.

426
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:38,163
I'm a softie.
I hired the guy.

427
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:41,291
He's more like a mascot than anything.
Mort, where's my coffee?

428
00:16:42,042 --> 00:16:44,128
Damn. Stupid Mort.

429
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:45,587
I know. It's okay,
just focus.

430
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:48,674
I'm going to take the cart
and show George Michael his new office.

431
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:52,011
-Speechless?
-How do I get back?

432
00:16:52,553 --> 00:16:53,512
When Fakeblock hits,

433
00:16:53,595 --> 00:16:55,264
we're going to have
to ramp up real fast.

434
00:16:55,431 --> 00:16:58,475
This hangar can
hold over 500 nerds!

435
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:00,728
Maeby, we can't afford this.

436
00:17:01,145 --> 00:17:03,063
And my software
isn't even ready.

437
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:04,273
Don't worry about that.

438
00:17:04,356 --> 00:17:07,985
Just worry about being done in time
for the big public unveiling at  Cinco.

439
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:10,112
-I'll get the money.
-Isn't that in three days?

440
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:12,656
No, that's Cinco de Mayo.
Cinco de Cuatro is in two days.

441
00:17:13,115 --> 00:17:15,617
We'll be doing it on a boat,
so I hope you don't get seasick.

442
00:17:15,826 --> 00:17:17,161
You're doing the keynote.

443
00:17:17,953 --> 00:17:20,706
You're responsible for all of this.

444
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:23,625
-Come on.
-What... No, I...

445
00:17:24,668 --> 00:17:25,794
I think we...

446
00:17:26,211 --> 00:17:27,796
All of this.

447
00:17:28,172 --> 00:17:29,757
I think we should
delay the keynote.

448
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:32,051
I'd say yes, but I don't think we can

449
00:17:32,134 --> 00:17:34,970
because of the sheer amount of money
that you have on the hook for it.

450
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:37,347
Maeby, you're fired!

451
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:41,185
<i>And although Mort knew</i>
<i>he was going to be next...</i>

452
00:17:41,268 --> 00:17:44,354
<i>there was nothing that could have</i>
<i>prepared George Michael</i>

453
00:17:44,438 --> 00:17:47,691
<i>for what Mort would end up</i>
<i>leaving on his desk.</i>

454
00:17:51,945 --> 00:17:54,615
<i>Maeby had just lost a big career option,</i>

455
00:17:54,823 --> 00:17:58,202
<i>and as she was on her way to</i>
<i>visit a high school boyfriend</i>

456
00:17:58,285 --> 00:17:59,953
<i>she was hoping to entrap...</i>

457
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:01,497
-What are you doing?
<i>-Long story.</i>

458
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:02,956
I'm just here to see Lucille Two.

459
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:05,751
<i>She ran into the current squatter</i>
<i>of the penthouse.</i>

460
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:08,504
Come here for one second.
I need to talk to you...

461
00:18:08,837 --> 00:18:10,547
about something very important.

462
00:18:11,173 --> 00:18:12,591
Yeah... Uncle Michael,

463
00:18:12,716 --> 00:18:14,384
I'm really sorry about that whole

464
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:16,261
"voting you out of the dorm" thing.

465
00:18:16,386 --> 00:18:17,930
We never really meant it to...

466
00:18:18,555 --> 00:18:19,431
I knew it.

467
00:18:19,681 --> 00:18:21,183
I knew you didn't understand it.

468
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:22,726
I knew you guys were all...

469
00:18:22,976 --> 00:18:23,852
'Cause I didn't...

470
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:25,729
I don't think I
explained it very well,

471
00:18:25,813 --> 00:18:27,731
and it was very simple.
I made it complicated.

472
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,525
It was a four-person vote.

473
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:32,444
I voted against myself, so that P-Hound...

474
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:34,363
That's a way that scenario
would've worked out.

475
00:18:34,446 --> 00:18:36,490
What I later realized is
there was another scenario...

476
00:18:36,615 --> 00:18:37,699
Maeby. There was another.

477
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:38,617
-Yeah.
-C scenario.

478
00:18:39,159 --> 00:18:41,662
-I really got to get going.
-Where you... Okay.

479
00:18:41,745 --> 00:18:44,331
Before you do...
I need your signature here at the bottom.

480
00:18:44,748 --> 00:18:46,291
Doing a movie about the family.

481
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:48,418
-Yeah. Is that still happening?
-What do you mean?

482
00:18:48,502 --> 00:18:50,212
I gotta tell you, I think movies are dead.

483
00:18:50,379 --> 00:18:52,548
Maybe, it's a TV show.

484
00:18:52,756 --> 00:18:54,967
This girl that I'm dating, Rebel,
she's gonna be in it,

485
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:56,093
and she would never do TV.

486
00:18:56,844 --> 00:18:58,303
You're dating Rebel Alley?

487
00:18:59,513 --> 00:19:01,223
Yeah, I have a picture of us
to prove it.

488
00:19:01,306 --> 00:19:02,432
I can't find it, but...

489
00:19:02,516 --> 00:19:04,560
So, you're the other guy.

490
00:19:04,726 --> 00:19:06,228
You know her personally?

491
00:19:06,311 --> 00:19:08,605
Yes. I mean, that's how I know

492
00:19:08,689 --> 00:19:09,731
that you were dating her.

493
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:12,067
Do you know the other guy
that she's dating?

494
00:19:12,276 --> 00:19:14,069
<i>And that's when she saw an opportunity</i>

495
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:15,696
<i>to get back at George Michael.</i>

496
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:19,158
No, no, but I know it's over.

497
00:19:19,241 --> 00:19:21,160
-She is dumping him.
-She's dumping him?

498
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:23,203
Apparently,
he was coming on too strong,

499
00:19:23,328 --> 00:19:24,913
taking it too seriously.

500
00:19:25,205 --> 00:19:26,498
She hates that.

501
00:19:26,623 --> 00:19:28,417
-That what she said?
-That's what she told me.

502
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:29,835
Just kills it for her.

503
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,295
She wants it easily-breezily.

504
00:19:32,504 --> 00:19:35,549
Well, that's informative.

505
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:37,259
I owe you. Thank you.

506
00:19:37,759 --> 00:19:38,677
No, you don't.

507
00:19:38,802 --> 00:19:41,180
Okay, wait, wait, wait.
Don't knock, just...

508
00:19:41,346 --> 00:19:42,181
Okay.

509
00:19:42,306 --> 00:19:43,348
One second.

510
00:19:46,977 --> 00:19:49,229
<i>And so fortified</i>
<i>with Maeby's information that</i>

511
00:19:49,354 --> 00:19:51,899
<i>Rebel was breaking up with</i>
<i>her other beau...</i>

512
00:19:51,982 --> 00:19:52,816
-Hello.
-Michael.

513
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:54,818
<i>...Michael decided</i>
<i>to move things along.</i>

514
00:19:54,902 --> 00:19:57,571
I think that I've been coming on
a little bit too strong.

515
00:19:57,654 --> 00:19:59,448
I got a lot going on,
I got the movie.

516
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:02,492
A bunch of stuff with the housing complex,
and I'm just...

517
00:20:02,576 --> 00:20:05,579
I'm not gonna be pressuring you anymore.
I want to just keep it easy-peasy.

518
00:20:05,662 --> 00:20:06,663
-Cool, totally.
-Yeah.

519
00:20:06,788 --> 00:20:08,498
-Keep it loose.
-Yeah.

520
00:20:08,582 --> 00:20:10,334
And we'll have some
fun with, you know...

521
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:12,169
If the fun, you know...

522
00:20:12,294 --> 00:20:15,297
Someday, one day,
it gets more serious,

523
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:18,425
you know,
then it does, and we...

524
00:20:18,508 --> 00:20:20,385
We're walking down the aisle,
you know, and...

525
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:23,889
I'm saying it wrong,
because I get tongue-tied,

526
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:27,267
because I think that you...

527
00:20:27,351 --> 00:20:29,853
are coming on too strong.

528
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:32,439
You know? Bugging me.

529
00:20:32,773 --> 00:20:33,774
You want to come in?

530
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:36,235
No?

531
00:20:38,028 --> 00:20:39,363
Yeah? Yeah.

532
00:20:42,032 --> 00:20:44,493
{\an8}<i>It was the best</i>
<i>sex Michael ever had.</i>

533
00:20:44,826 --> 00:20:45,661
Was that fun for you?

534
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:46,662
No.

535
00:20:48,163 --> 00:20:50,249
Are you gonna
take a photo of me?

536
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:51,792
No...

537
00:20:52,042 --> 00:20:54,294
No, no, I've been
trying to get a signal.

538
00:20:54,836 --> 00:20:56,463
<i>But he wanted</i>
<i>a picture of them together,</i>

539
00:20:57,464 --> 00:20:59,007
<i>which is why he grabbed the one he saw</i>

540
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:00,634
<i>from the photo booth.</i>

541
00:21:00,801 --> 00:21:02,010
Are you gonna call me?

542
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:03,345
If I'm in traffic.

543
00:21:03,595 --> 00:21:05,013
<i>Although he was</i>
<i>growing concerned</i>

544
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:07,140
<i>about how he was</i>
<i>going to keep this up.</i>

545
00:21:09,685 --> 00:21:10,519
Hey.

546
00:21:10,602 --> 00:21:12,938
<i>âª I just stole this fair young miss âª</i>

547
00:21:13,021 --> 00:21:15,315
<i>âª From a big shot, George... âª</i>

548
00:21:18,068 --> 00:21:18,902
[bleep]

549
00:21:20,529 --> 00:21:24,658
{\an8}<i>On the next </i>Arrested Development:
Fateful Consequences.

550
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:27,953
<i>Having found out the woman he loves</i>

551
00:21:28,036 --> 00:21:29,788
<i>is also dating his son...</i>

552
00:21:30,998 --> 00:21:33,834
<i>Michael places a call to the niece</i>

553
00:21:33,917 --> 00:21:35,627
-Hello?
-You're out of the movie.

554
00:21:38,171 --> 00:21:40,048
<i>And George Michael finds himself</i>

555
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:43,468
<i>the subject of a lawsuit</i>
<i>over the ownership of Fakeblock.</i>

556
00:21:43,719 --> 00:21:45,429
Was it or was it not my client

557
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:47,264
who put up the initial seed money

558
00:21:47,347 --> 00:21:48,598
for the block software

559
00:21:48,682 --> 00:21:51,643
that served as the
underlying architecture of Fakeblock?

560
00:21:51,727 --> 00:21:53,020
It was 99 cents.

561
00:21:53,103 --> 00:21:55,230
[all] Times three.

562
00:21:58,775 --> 00:22:00,610
Can I say something to my client?

563
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:03,113
Take to the sea!
