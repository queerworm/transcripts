NARRATOR:<i> Michael Bluth</i>
<i>was starting a new job</i>

2
00:00:14,375 --> 00:00:16,250
<i>when he received a call</i>
<i>from attorney Barry Zuckerkorn.</i>

3
00:00:16,291 --> 00:00:17,834
Hello. Michael Bluth,
residential complexes.

4
00:00:17,875 --> 00:00:19,709
-(horn honks)
-MAN: Take a picture of this!

5
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:21,083
BARRY:
Hey, Michael.

6
00:00:21,125 --> 00:00:23,083
-You're in real estate again?
-Sort of.

7
00:00:23,125 --> 00:00:25,667
<i>Michael had tried</i>
<i>to leave real estate behind</i>

8
00:00:25,709 --> 00:00:27,083
<i>and get a job</i>
<i>in the high-tech sector.</i>

9
00:00:27,125 --> 00:00:28,458
However...

10
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:30,542
I will tell you
that in my last position,

11
00:00:30,583 --> 00:00:32,500
I had a company car provision.

12
00:00:32,542 --> 00:00:34,875
I think we may have something
that can get you a car.

13
00:00:34,917 --> 00:00:36,583
-Hey, Gare-Bear?
-Yeah?

14
00:00:36,625 --> 00:00:38,291
I think we got an ostrich.

15
00:00:38,333 --> 00:00:39,792
-Oh, God, grab him.
-What is it?

16
00:00:39,834 --> 00:00:43,291
Now, with this car,
you may get some stares.

17
00:00:43,333 --> 00:00:45,208
I'm used to a car
with some stairs.

18
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:46,917
NARRATOR:
<i>Albeit one that had trouble</i>

19
00:00:46,959 --> 00:00:50,792
<i>negotiating</i>
<i>low-hanging obstacles.</i>

20
00:00:50,834 --> 00:00:52,125
(horn honking)

21
00:00:52,166 --> 00:00:54,750
(tires squealing)

22
00:00:54,792 --> 00:00:57,709
<i>Which is why</i>
<i>he'd parted with it.</i>

23
00:00:57,750 --> 00:00:59,208
MICHAEL:<i> I'm actually working</i>
<i>in high tech,</i>

24
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:00,792
but it does collide
with real estate.

25
00:01:00,834 --> 00:01:03,875
<i>This is going to be low.</i>

26
00:01:03,917 --> 00:01:05,291
Ah, I hooked it.

27
00:01:05,333 --> 00:01:06,333
NARRATOR:
<i>Michael was driving a car</i>

28
00:01:06,375 --> 00:01:07,750
<i>from a company that shows</i>

29
00:01:07,792 --> 00:01:09,917
<i>every private residence</i>
<i>in the country.</i>

30
00:01:09,959 --> 00:01:13,166
<i>But it's also a company</i>
<i>that won't let us</i>

31
00:01:13,208 --> 00:01:15,333
<i>show the car</i>
<i>that takes those pictures.</i>

32
00:01:15,375 --> 00:01:17,875
<i>In fairness to them,</i>
<i>it is their property.</i>

33
00:01:17,917 --> 00:01:19,417
(horn honking)

34
00:01:19,458 --> 00:01:21,125
<i>If you want to know</i>
<i>what the company is...</i>

35
00:01:21,166 --> 00:01:22,792
Save it. We're just
going to blur it anyway.

36
00:01:22,834 --> 00:01:24,041
<i>...all you have to do is...</i>

37
00:01:24,083 --> 00:01:25,375
<i>"something" it.</i>

38
00:01:25,417 --> 00:01:26,625
Barry, you still there?

39
00:01:26,667 --> 00:01:28,959
So I got a really
interesting call

40
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,125
from Ron Howard, of all people.

41
00:01:31,166 --> 00:01:32,792
He's directing now, apparently,

42
00:01:32,834 --> 00:01:34,625
and wants to meet you
at his office

43
00:01:34,667 --> 00:01:36,917
in-- get this-- Beverly Hills.

44
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:38,375
-Why does Ron How...
-(horn honks)

45
00:01:38,417 --> 00:01:40,458
Why does Ron Howard want
to meet with me?

46
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:42,291
Oh, I didn't know. His office
didn't say, and if you

47
00:01:42,333 --> 00:01:44,250
don't mind, I'm a little busy
with a case of my own.

48
00:01:44,291 --> 00:01:46,166
Did you get
any other information?

49
00:01:46,208 --> 00:01:48,542
Apparently, he directed
a movie called<i> Cocoon.</i>

50
00:01:48,583 --> 00:01:50,000
MICHAEL:
Sorry. I was unclear

51
00:01:50,041 --> 00:01:51,834
<i>about why he wants</i>
<i>to meet with me.</i>

52
00:01:51,875 --> 00:01:53,709
I don't know. You want me to
tell him to go (bleep) himself?

53
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:55,667
I can tell Ron Howard
to go (bleep) himself.

54
00:01:55,709 --> 00:01:57,375
Tell him to shove it
up his (bleep).

55
00:01:57,417 --> 00:01:58,709
I just can't do it now

56
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:00,542
because I'm in front of a jury.

57
00:02:00,583 --> 00:02:01,959
Barry, I will meet with him.

58
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,542
You're in front of a jury
right now?

59
00:02:03,583 --> 00:02:05,375
Oh, and the looks I'm getting.
Got to go.

60
00:02:05,417 --> 00:02:07,208
Sorry, everybody.
I'm an attorney, too.

61
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:09,375
BOB: Ladies and gentlemen
of the jury,

62
00:02:09,417 --> 00:02:12,083
I'd like the defendant
to reach over the school gate,

63
00:02:12,125 --> 00:02:13,583
open it from the inside

64
00:02:13,625 --> 00:02:15,542
and enter the school
property, please.

65
00:02:15,583 --> 00:02:18,709
I can't reach it.
I can't reach the knob.

66
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:20,375
Why is that,
Mr. Zuckerkorn?

67
00:02:20,417 --> 00:02:22,333
-I'm not tall enough.
-You're not tall enough.

68
00:02:22,375 --> 00:02:24,250
I can't reach the chotchie.

69
00:02:24,291 --> 00:02:25,917
Hey, should I try tippy-toe?

70
00:02:25,959 --> 00:02:27,583
Look, I'm on tippy-toes.

71
00:02:27,625 --> 00:02:29,500
If he can't reach,
this trial's a breach.

72
00:02:29,542 --> 00:02:32,000
Ooh, and that's what
we call a Law Bomb.

73
00:02:32,041 --> 00:02:33,458
That's a low blow, Loblaw.

74
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:34,750
A Bob Loblaw Law Bomb.

75
00:02:37,792 --> 00:02:39,333
NARRATOR:
<i>Now the story</i>

76
00:02:39,375 --> 00:02:42,375
<i>of a family who's future</i>
<i>was abruptly cancelled</i>

77
00:02:42,875 --> 00:02:44,417
<i>and the one son</i>
<i>who had no choice</i>

78
00:02:44,458 --> 00:02:46,583
<i>but to keep himself together.</i>

79
00:02:50,458 --> 00:02:52,208
<i>It's Michael's...</i>

80
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:57,458
<i>Michael drove to the</i>
<i>North American headquarters</i>

81
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:59,041
<i>of Imagine Entertainment,</i>

82
00:02:59,083 --> 00:03:01,834
<i>the modest film television</i>
<i>and streaming colossus</i>

83
00:03:01,875 --> 00:03:04,333
<i>of Brian Grazer and Ron Howard.</i>

84
00:03:04,375 --> 00:03:07,875
<i>And got his first taste</i>
<i>of how cruel Hollywood can be.</i>

85
00:03:07,917 --> 00:03:09,792
That's not very nice.

86
00:03:09,834 --> 00:03:12,166
KITTY: "Ankles" means "leaves"
in<i> Variety,</i> Michael.

87
00:03:12,208 --> 00:03:15,333
Kitty Sanchez.
What are you doing here?

88
00:03:15,375 --> 00:03:16,959
I work here. I'm a "D" girl.

89
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,750
No, I don't want
to see them.

90
00:03:18,792 --> 00:03:21,583
I'm not going to show you
my (bleep), you pig.

91
00:03:21,625 --> 00:03:23,166
It means "development."

92
00:03:23,208 --> 00:03:25,875
I'm a movie executive.
I work for Ron Howard now.

93
00:03:25,917 --> 00:03:28,834
NARRATOR:<i> And she'd proven</i>
<i>as loyal to him as she was</i>

94
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:31,542
<i>to her former boss,</i>
<i>Michael's father.</i>

95
00:03:31,583 --> 00:03:34,417
<i>But without the</i>
<i>quote, unquote "benefits."</i>

96
00:03:34,458 --> 00:03:37,083
<i>Also, Imagine provided</i>
<i>no health benefits.</i>

97
00:03:37,125 --> 00:03:39,000
Great for you.
How'd you get this job?

98
00:03:39,041 --> 00:03:42,000
Women can be movie executives,
you pig. I knew people.

99
00:03:42,041 --> 00:03:44,417
You're probably going to call me
a pig for this, too,

100
00:03:44,458 --> 00:03:46,917
but are you sure that
you meant to say "knew"?

101
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:48,500
<i>She did.</i>

102
00:03:48,542 --> 00:03:50,125
<i>The only thing at Imagine</i>
<i>that Kitty blew</i>

103
00:03:50,166 --> 00:03:52,959
<i>was smoke up the skirt</i>
<i>of the young woman</i>

104
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,792
<i>who hired her,</i>
<i>Michael's niece, Maeby,</i>

105
00:03:55,834 --> 00:03:58,208
<i>who was then working</i>
<i>as a film executive.</i>

106
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:00,125
My first project
is about my family.

107
00:04:00,166 --> 00:04:01,667
Ooh!

108
00:04:01,709 --> 00:04:03,000
Yeah, which is why I thought
you'd be a perfect assistant--

109
00:04:03,041 --> 00:04:04,583
because you know where
all the bodies are buried.

110
00:04:04,625 --> 00:04:06,250
And I even helped
bury some of them.

111
00:04:06,291 --> 00:04:08,583
<i>Maeby was only 17 at the time.</i>

112
00:04:08,625 --> 00:04:10,208
Also, um, can you buy me booze?

113
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,500
Totally.

114
00:04:12,834 --> 00:04:14,542
(whispering):
Whatever else, too.

115
00:04:14,583 --> 00:04:17,208
'Cause I can get you smack
or hash or Special K...

116
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:20,000
<i>Unfortunately,</i>
<i>when Maeby was shooting</i>

117
00:04:20,041 --> 00:04:24,834
<i>out of town on a picture,</i>
<i>Kitty saw to it...</i>

118
00:04:24,875 --> 00:04:26,834
She didn't even get releases
from her family.

119
00:04:26,875 --> 00:04:28,542
<i>that Maeby's was one</i>
<i>of the bodies that was buried.</i>

120
00:04:28,583 --> 00:04:30,250
And I begged her to.

121
00:04:30,291 --> 00:04:32,417
<i>And the project got thrown</i>
<i>on the back burner.</i>

122
00:04:32,458 --> 00:04:35,166
MICHAEL:<i> Do you have any idea</i>
<i>why Ron Howard wants to see me?</i>

123
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:37,583
Believe me, if I could
think like Ron Howard,

124
00:04:37,625 --> 00:04:40,208
I'd own the second largest
building in Beverly Hills.

125
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:42,166
<i>Only Jerry Bruckheimer's</i>
<i>building</i>

126
00:04:42,208 --> 00:04:43,834
<i>was technically taller.</i>

127
00:04:43,875 --> 00:04:45,500
<i>But who wants to be</i>
<i>south of Wilshire?</i>

128
00:04:45,542 --> 00:04:47,291
WOMAN:
<i>Mr. Howard will see you now.</i>

129
00:04:47,333 --> 00:04:49,667
-Oh, great. 
-I'll take you
to the private elevator.

130
00:04:49,709 --> 00:04:52,542
-Thanks. 
-Ooh! Going to meet
the big man himself.

131
00:04:52,583 --> 00:04:55,709
<i>But first, Michael would have</i>
<i>to pass a few little Rons.</i>

132
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:56,834
Michael Bluth.

133
00:04:56,875 --> 00:04:59,208
-Hey.
-Hey, nice try, mister.

134
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:01,208
We're never going
to beat the original.

135
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:02,792
-Well, that's what
I've been saying. 
-Hi. Hey.

136
00:05:02,834 --> 00:05:04,583
-Oh, Michael. Hey,
thanks for coming down.
-How are you?

137
00:05:04,625 --> 00:05:06,000
-Pleasure to meet you.
-I'm just finishing up

138
00:05:06,041 --> 00:05:07,375
casting this
<i>Andy Griffith Show</i> thing.

139
00:05:07,417 --> 00:05:08,625
Okay. Yeah.

140
00:05:08,667 --> 00:05:09,875
Hang on a second.

141
00:05:09,917 --> 00:05:11,333
You guys finally
making that movie?

142
00:05:11,375 --> 00:05:13,208
I've been reading about it
for, like, 40 years.

143
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:15,041
Well, it's not
a done deal yet,

144
00:05:15,083 --> 00:05:16,709
-but I want to talk about you.
-Yeah.

145
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:18,333
-Hey, let's go inside the LEM.
-(gasps)

146
00:05:18,375 --> 00:05:20,333
-You want to?
-Wow. Is this the one

147
00:05:20,375 --> 00:05:21,583
that landed
on the moon?

148
00:05:21,625 --> 00:05:22,834
On a soundstage.

149
00:05:22,875 --> 00:05:24,458
Oh, right,
from<i> Apollo 13.</i>

150
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:26,083
No, no, 1969.

151
00:05:26,125 --> 00:05:27,959
I'll tell you about it
inside the LEM.

152
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,667
It's soundproof in there.

153
00:05:29,709 --> 00:05:31,542
And it's a national secret.

154
00:05:31,583 --> 00:05:34,166
So, NASA did go to the moon
in '71.

155
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:35,917
That one was real.

156
00:05:35,959 --> 00:05:38,250
But in '69, they weren't ready,

157
00:05:38,291 --> 00:05:42,083
so they faked the whole thing
on the soundstage of<i> Gentle Ben.</i>

158
00:05:42,125 --> 00:05:43,250
-Boy.
-Me and my brother,

159
00:05:43,291 --> 00:05:44,917
we hid up in the rafters.

160
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:46,417
-We seen the whole thing.
-Ah.

161
00:05:46,458 --> 00:05:48,166
But I want to talk to
you about something.

162
00:05:48,208 --> 00:05:49,792
Okay.

163
00:05:49,834 --> 00:05:52,375
For the last year, I've
been going to Phoenix.

164
00:05:52,417 --> 00:05:54,583
Whoa, whoa. Hang on, now.

165
00:05:54,625 --> 00:05:55,917
Are you kidding me?

166
00:05:55,959 --> 00:05:57,750
I'm a... I'm a Phoenix.

167
00:05:57,792 --> 00:06:00,041
I've-I've never... I've never
met anyone else in person

168
00:06:00,083 --> 00:06:01,291
that, uh...
that also goes there.

169
00:06:01,333 --> 00:06:03,041
That's amazing.

170
00:06:03,083 --> 00:06:05,375
I guess that's the downside
of going to college online, huh?

171
00:06:05,417 --> 00:06:07,458
Well, I... I just got
a sick aunt down there.

172
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,667
-Oh, I see.
-But on the last flight,

173
00:06:09,709 --> 00:06:11,417
I was flipping
through the magazine,

174
00:06:11,458 --> 00:06:13,166
-and I... I saw something.
-Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

175
00:06:13,208 --> 00:06:14,917
Not-not...
not the begging photo.

176
00:06:14,959 --> 00:06:16,709
Now, I don't think
you know this about me,

177
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:19,500
but most of my movies
are based

178
00:06:19,542 --> 00:06:21,625
on still photographs
that I find truly inspiring.

179
00:06:21,667 --> 00:06:23,041
NARRATOR:
<i>It was true.</i>

180
00:06:23,083 --> 00:06:25,000
Splash<i> was based</i>
<i>on what turned out</i>

181
00:06:25,041 --> 00:06:27,083
<i>to be a counterfeit Hockney</i>

182
00:06:27,125 --> 00:06:29,542
<i>that Brian talked Ron</i>
<i>into buying.</i>

183
00:06:29,583 --> 00:06:32,875
The Da Vinci Code
<i>was from this photo.</i>

184
00:06:32,917 --> 00:06:34,750
RON HOWARD:
<i>You know</i> Willow?

185
00:06:34,792 --> 00:06:37,792
That was from a Soft 'n Snuggly
coupon I got in the mail.

186
00:06:37,834 --> 00:06:39,834
But a man who is
passionate enough

187
00:06:39,875 --> 00:06:42,375
to beg, well, that's a character

188
00:06:42,417 --> 00:06:44,709
whose story we really want
to see.

189
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:46,458
-Really? 
-Plus I've been dying
to figure out

190
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:48,542
a way to do something
about the market crash

191
00:06:48,583 --> 00:06:50,500
ever since my partner,
Brian Grazer, was tipped off

192
00:06:50,542 --> 00:06:52,208
that it was three months
away from happening.

193
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:53,542
What's that?

194
00:06:53,583 --> 00:06:55,333
But I never had a face
to put on it.

195
00:06:55,375 --> 00:06:57,250
Until now. You.

196
00:06:57,291 --> 00:06:59,291
Your wife is dying.

197
00:06:59,333 --> 00:07:01,000
You're trying to hold
your family together.

198
00:07:01,041 --> 00:07:02,875
Oh, gosh, no, no, no.

199
00:07:02,917 --> 00:07:06,041
My wife died years before
any... any of this.

200
00:07:06,083 --> 00:07:08,166
Oh, gee.

201
00:07:09,834 --> 00:07:12,375
I think it's a lot more fun
if we see her die.

202
00:07:12,417 --> 00:07:14,000
-That is fun.
-And by the way,

203
00:07:14,041 --> 00:07:17,291
then it's a fantastic part
for a leading lady.

204
00:07:17,333 --> 00:07:20,000
In fact, my girl Rebel
would be great in that part.

205
00:07:20,041 --> 00:07:21,291
Your girl?

206
00:07:21,333 --> 00:07:22,542
Rebel Alley.

207
00:07:22,583 --> 00:07:23,709
She's an actress.
You know her.

208
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:24,959
NARRATOR:
<i>He didn't.</i>

209
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,333
I do.
Yes, of course I do.

210
00:07:26,375 --> 00:07:27,792
Your girl, huh?

211
00:07:27,834 --> 00:07:30,125
Well, we kind of like
to keep that quiet.

212
00:07:30,166 --> 00:07:31,625
<i>Michael assumed</i>
<i>that by "my girl,"</i>

213
00:07:31,667 --> 00:07:33,125
<i>Ron was referring</i>
<i>to his mistress...</i>

214
00:07:33,166 --> 00:07:35,333
I can see why you're
telling me in the LEM, huh?

215
00:07:35,375 --> 00:07:39,041
<i>...but Ron was actually</i>
<i>talking about his daughter.</i>

216
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:42,208
You probably think I'm terrible
for even mentioning her to you.

217
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:44,125
Oh, no, no,
I'm-I'm not one to judge.

218
00:07:44,166 --> 00:07:46,417
I'm sure you've all got girls
up here in Hollywood, huh?

219
00:07:46,458 --> 00:07:48,625
Brian's got two boys.

220
00:07:50,959 --> 00:07:53,417
I think you're a natural
and it could be a great movie.

221
00:07:53,458 --> 00:07:54,875
You know, and-and
it's a real chance

222
00:07:54,917 --> 00:07:56,250
to show you guys off, too.

223
00:07:56,291 --> 00:07:57,583
Us guys?

224
00:07:57,625 --> 00:07:59,875
Well, it's about
the whole family.

225
00:07:59,917 --> 00:08:01,500
Them?

226
00:08:01,542 --> 00:08:03,041
We're going to need
everybody's signature

227
00:08:03,083 --> 00:08:05,875
on these releases in order
to make this story.

228
00:08:05,917 --> 00:08:07,500
Although the real
heartbeat of this thing

229
00:08:07,542 --> 00:08:08,875
is the father-son dynamic.

230
00:08:08,917 --> 00:08:10,291
Yeah. You know, Ron,

231
00:08:10,333 --> 00:08:12,166
I-I don't know if I can do this.

232
00:08:12,208 --> 00:08:14,208
We're not in a great way
right now,

233
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:16,041
and-and it might not
be worth...

234
00:08:16,083 --> 00:08:18,625
Michael, take a few of these
cards and really think about it.

235
00:08:18,667 --> 00:08:20,625
-All right. 
-Yeah, man, I got
a tough meeting coming up now.

236
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:24,542
How do you tell Ed Harris
that he's simply not a Barney?

237
00:08:24,583 --> 00:08:27,542
NARRATOR:<i> And while Ed was</i>
<i>getting some bad news,</i>

238
00:08:27,583 --> 00:08:29,375
<i>Michael got some good news.</i>

239
00:08:29,417 --> 00:08:30,875
Excuse me.
Uh, is this a mistake?

240
00:08:30,917 --> 00:08:32,250
Am I a producer?

241
00:08:32,291 --> 00:08:33,542
It's one of the perks

242
00:08:33,583 --> 00:08:35,083
of having a movie
made about you.

243
00:08:35,125 --> 00:08:36,959
Huh.

244
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,333
Health plan is not
another one, by the way.

245
00:08:39,375 --> 00:08:41,375
There's no health plan.

246
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:46,583
NARRATOR:<i> Michael had been given</i>
<i>an opportunity</i>

247
00:08:46,625 --> 00:08:48,709
<i>to turn his life around,</i>
<i>and all he had to do</i>

248
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:50,667
<i>to make it happen was to get</i>

249
00:08:50,709 --> 00:08:52,500
<i>-his family's signatures.</i>
<i>-</i> ...the family signatures,

250
00:08:52,542 --> 00:08:55,333
especially my father's.

251
00:08:55,375 --> 00:08:56,583
BARRY:
Wow, sounds like your thing

252
00:08:56,625 --> 00:08:58,083
went a lot better
than my thing.

253
00:08:58,125 --> 00:09:00,834
Except I haven't spoken
to them for a long time.

254
00:09:00,875 --> 00:09:04,083
I mean, since I...
well, since-since my mom...

255
00:09:04,125 --> 00:09:05,625
Left?

256
00:09:05,667 --> 00:09:07,417
Yeah, for prison, yeah.

257
00:09:07,458 --> 00:09:08,792
You want to know what?

258
00:09:08,834 --> 00:09:10,375
Frankly, I think Ron Howard

259
00:09:10,417 --> 00:09:12,625
just wants to get a movie
for his girlfriend.

260
00:09:12,667 --> 00:09:14,875
Oh, it sounds like Ron Howard
is casting with his (bleep).

261
00:09:14,917 --> 00:09:16,667
Well...

262
00:09:16,709 --> 00:09:19,625
it is hard to believe,
but I guess they've all got

263
00:09:19,667 --> 00:09:22,000
their mistresses up here
in showbiz, you know.

264
00:09:22,041 --> 00:09:23,750
It's like it's
their God-given...

265
00:09:23,792 --> 00:09:25,917
Front?
No, right.

266
00:09:25,959 --> 00:09:27,667
-No, right. 
-Calm down,
everybody, all right?

267
00:09:27,709 --> 00:09:29,375
-I got it. I got it.
-You think my dad

268
00:09:29,417 --> 00:09:31,041
would ever even go
for something like this?

269
00:09:31,083 --> 00:09:33,417
You know, it's very hard
to get a signature out of him.

270
00:09:33,458 --> 00:09:35,208
It's... it's like somebody
a long time ago said...

271
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:37,000
BOTH: Hey, what if you never
signed anything

272
00:09:37,041 --> 00:09:38,834
because you said you didn't
have a signature?

273
00:09:38,875 --> 00:09:41,166
-Just like you, Pop.
-You... you don't
have a signature?

274
00:09:41,208 --> 00:09:42,709
No, and he's never
given me one card.

275
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:44,208
Not one birthday
card, which is why

276
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:45,500
his presents are
always money orders.

277
00:09:45,542 --> 00:09:46,750
Right, Pop?

278
00:09:46,792 --> 00:09:48,875
-I don't have a signature.
-Oh!

279
00:09:48,917 --> 00:09:50,667
If you don't sign,
you will be fine.

280
00:09:50,709 --> 00:09:52,166
Hey.

281
00:09:52,208 --> 00:09:53,583
He's very smart.

282
00:09:53,625 --> 00:09:55,458
He's very good.

283
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:56,959
Can you feel your hands?

284
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,417
I can't feel my pinky
or this one.

285
00:10:00,542 --> 00:10:01,959
MICHAEL: 
<i>I hear what you're saying.</i>

286
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,250
I... My dad would never do
something like this for me.

287
00:10:03,291 --> 00:10:04,583
I'm going to head back in,
and I'm going to...

288
00:10:04,625 --> 00:10:06,041
I'm going to tell Ron Howard
to forget about it.

289
00:10:06,083 --> 00:10:07,250
-Yeah, you're screwed.
Hey, do me a favor. 
-Yeah.

290
00:10:07,291 --> 00:10:08,333
-Tell Ron Howard to go
-Okay.

291
00:10:08,375 --> 00:10:09,750
-shove his... (bleep)
-Bye-bye, Barry.

292
00:10:09,792 --> 00:10:12,166
-Oh!
-Sorry. Whoops.

293
00:10:12,208 --> 00:10:13,291
Whoa. Sorry.
That was my fault.

294
00:10:13,333 --> 00:10:14,792
-No.
-I was looking at my phone.

295
00:10:14,834 --> 00:10:16,125
It's not too embarrassing
walking around

296
00:10:16,166 --> 00:10:17,625
with a bunch of photographs
of yourself.

297
00:10:17,667 --> 00:10:19,500
Oh, well, looks like
it's part of your job, huh?

298
00:10:19,542 --> 00:10:22,542
-You're an actress?
-No, I'm a narcissist.

299
00:10:22,583 --> 00:10:25,125
Yeah, actually, "actress"
is an overstatement because...

300
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:26,583
Ugh. Thank you.

301
00:10:26,625 --> 00:10:28,750
I was just sucking at
this audition I went on.

302
00:10:28,792 --> 00:10:31,750
It was one of these ridiculous
meet-cute clichés,

303
00:10:31,792 --> 00:10:33,875
where a guy and a girl
just, you know... 

304
00:10:33,917 --> 00:10:36,166
they bump into each
other, and they...

305
00:10:36,208 --> 00:10:38,083
they fall in love.

306
00:10:38,125 --> 00:10:40,625
God, you're handsome.

307
00:10:40,667 --> 00:10:42,917
I got a...
maybe a lucky hair day.

308
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:44,333
You're the beautiful one.

309
00:10:44,375 --> 00:10:47,125
You have beautiful eyes.

310
00:10:47,166 --> 00:10:50,166
My deceased wife had red hair.

311
00:10:50,208 --> 00:10:52,083
Yep, garbage like that.

312
00:10:52,125 --> 00:10:54,041
And it's so unbelievable.

313
00:10:54,083 --> 00:10:55,542
Like, they never get
each other's names.

314
00:10:55,583 --> 00:10:57,667
Pretty stupid. Whoops. Gosh.

315
00:10:57,709 --> 00:10:59,625
-Oh... oh! Ow!
-Oh! Are you okay?

316
00:10:59,667 --> 00:11:01,125
-That really hurt.
-Ooh. You okay?

317
00:11:01,166 --> 00:11:02,750
I wish I had done that
well in the audition.

318
00:11:02,792 --> 00:11:06,291
Where's a movie producer
when you need one, right?

319
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:07,834
Well, it was really
nice to meet you.

320
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:09,458
Yes, you, too.

321
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:11,834
I'm a "moobie" producer.

322
00:11:11,875 --> 00:11:13,291
Sorry. I'm a movie...

323
00:11:13,333 --> 00:11:14,625
Here, I've got...

324
00:11:14,667 --> 00:11:16,625
I've got proof here, huh?

325
00:11:16,667 --> 00:11:18,083
-Oh, you are a movie producer.
-Yeah.

326
00:11:18,125 --> 00:11:19,959
Yeah, there's a part
for a wife,

327
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,959
and you'd be perfect
for the movie.

328
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,125
(chuckling)

329
00:11:24,166 --> 00:11:26,041
Do you like Scottish music?

330
00:11:26,083 --> 00:11:28,667
Uh, with the screeching horns
and the silly...

331
00:11:28,709 --> 00:11:30,667
Yeah. I'm in a band.

332
00:11:30,709 --> 00:11:32,500
I love it. It's great.

333
00:11:32,542 --> 00:11:34,333
We're playing at the Ealing
Club tomorrow night, and...

334
00:11:34,375 --> 00:11:36,333
maybe you could come and...
and just check it out.

335
00:11:36,375 --> 00:11:38,375
Oh, yeah?
I don't even know what that is.

336
00:11:38,417 --> 00:11:39,542
(laughing)

337
00:11:39,583 --> 00:11:40,917
I should've... Sorry.

338
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:42,250
That's funny.
I should have said "where."

339
00:11:42,291 --> 00:11:43,709
Of course,
I know what it is.

340
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:45,458
No, it's on the top
of that building.

341
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:47,709
-Okay. 
-But can you imagine
driving that car?

342
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:50,083
No, I can't. No.

343
00:11:50,125 --> 00:11:52,750
NARRATOR:<i> It wasn't until</i>
<i>Michael had walked</i>

344
00:11:52,792 --> 00:11:55,417
<i>two blocks past the</i>
<i>California Pizza Kitchen</i>

345
00:11:55,458 --> 00:11:56,834
<i>when this happened.</i>

346
00:11:56,875 --> 00:11:58,750
♪ Hey, I met a girl today ♪

347
00:11:58,792 --> 00:12:00,000
♪ And her name is... ♪

348
00:12:00,041 --> 00:12:01,417
(bleep)

349
00:12:01,458 --> 00:12:04,417
<i>So Michael went back</i>
<i>to find her</i>

350
00:12:04,458 --> 00:12:06,458
<i>or, at the very least,</i>
<i>try looking for a head shot</i>

351
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,375
<i>-with her name on it. </i>
-Nothing, huh?

352
00:12:08,417 --> 00:12:09,709
She was super-pretty,
red hair...

353
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:10,917
<i>But even without her name,</i>

354
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:13,500
<i>he knew his only chance</i>
<i>with her</i>

355
00:12:13,542 --> 00:12:15,291
<i>was to be a real producer,</i>
<i>and that meant</i>

356
00:12:15,333 --> 00:12:17,834
<i>getting a signature</i>
<i>from a father whose face</i>

357
00:12:17,875 --> 00:12:18,959
<i>he hadn't seen in ages.</i>

358
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,208
LUCILLE 2:
Oh, you're making me dizzy!

359
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:21,834
<i>And that's when he</i>
<i>suddenly did.</i>

360
00:12:21,875 --> 00:12:23,834
LUCILLE 2: We have
to keep this quiet!

361
00:12:23,875 --> 00:12:25,041
Dad?

362
00:12:25,083 --> 00:12:28,083
No, no.

363
00:12:28,125 --> 00:12:30,125
-Hi. 
-LUCILLE 2: Don't say
I'm down here.

364
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:32,208
-Right here.
-Hey.

365
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:34,083
What's going on?

366
00:12:34,125 --> 00:12:35,625
I just came back to get, uh...

367
00:12:35,667 --> 00:12:36,959
LUCILLE 2 (whispering):
Don't acknowledge me.

368
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,709
...get some suits, you know,

369
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:41,000
so I can look like the uptight,

370
00:12:41,041 --> 00:12:43,792
dishonest, cheating boob
that I am.

371
00:12:43,834 --> 00:12:46,166
Well, I never said "boob."

372
00:12:46,208 --> 00:12:48,250
Although you are in
the wrong Lucille's apartment,

373
00:12:48,291 --> 00:12:50,500
so unless you're looking
for a Bob Mackie original,

374
00:12:50,542 --> 00:12:52,208
could be some truth
to the cheating part.

375
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:53,750
Yeah, well, I was
in the desert,

376
00:12:53,792 --> 00:12:55,250
and I've lost my
sense of direction.

377
00:12:55,291 --> 00:12:56,792
-(clears throat)
-Hey. Where you going?

378
00:12:56,834 --> 00:12:58,166
Dad.

379
00:12:59,166 --> 00:13:00,667
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

380
00:13:00,709 --> 00:13:01,959
Listen.

381
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,625
You're getting divorced.

382
00:13:03,667 --> 00:13:05,834
I am not one to judge.

383
00:13:07,166 --> 00:13:08,750
Great to see you again.

384
00:13:08,792 --> 00:13:10,750
The past is the past, and
things have worked out,

385
00:13:10,792 --> 00:13:12,792
and I've met a
wonderful woman named...

386
00:13:12,834 --> 00:13:16,291
Don't worry about that,
but I'm a movie producer now.

387
00:13:16,333 --> 00:13:18,125
Unbelievable.

388
00:13:18,166 --> 00:13:20,709
They're making a movie
out of my life.

389
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:22,792
The girl I met is perfect
to play my wife.

390
00:13:22,834 --> 00:13:24,500
And it's... I don't know.

391
00:13:24,542 --> 00:13:26,667
Can you believe it?
And I know what you're thinking:

392
00:13:26,709 --> 00:13:29,000
-"Can you put me in it?"
-I don't care.

393
00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:30,333
Do I have what
I hope I've got?

394
00:13:30,375 --> 00:13:31,667
Anybody who's getting
in the movie

395
00:13:31,709 --> 00:13:33,333
needs to sign this.

396
00:13:33,375 --> 00:13:35,125
It's a simple signature.

397
00:13:35,166 --> 00:13:36,583
I think that everybody
needs to see

398
00:13:36,625 --> 00:13:38,125
who the real George
Sr. is, don't you?

399
00:13:38,166 --> 00:13:42,500
I think it would all depend
on how George Sr. was portrayed.

400
00:13:42,542 --> 00:13:44,125
Well...

401
00:13:44,166 --> 00:13:49,125
he is not the most
positive character, but...

402
00:13:49,166 --> 00:13:52,083
you sign this, and I
don't see any reason

403
00:13:52,125 --> 00:13:55,291
why we can't make him
seem very, very, uh...

404
00:13:55,333 --> 00:13:57,041
uh, you know...

405
00:13:57,083 --> 00:13:59,583
uh...

406
00:13:59,625 --> 00:14:01,583
uh...

407
00:14:01,625 --> 00:14:03,542
uh...

408
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:11,458
...nice.

409
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:13,083
-Go to hell.
-Huh?

410
00:14:13,125 --> 00:14:15,125
NARRATOR:
<i>Michael was actually relieved.</i>

411
00:14:15,166 --> 00:14:16,375
You go to hell.

412
00:14:16,417 --> 00:14:18,250
<i>He had no idea how he was</i>

413
00:14:18,291 --> 00:14:20,291
<i>going to make</i>
<i>his father seem nice.</i>

414
00:14:23,333 --> 00:14:25,375
NARRATOR:<i> Michael Bluth</i>
<i>was starting his new life</i>

415
00:14:25,417 --> 00:14:28,417
<i>as a producer in-- get this--</i>
<i>Beverly Hills</i>

416
00:14:28,458 --> 00:14:31,083
<i>without the signature</i>
<i>he needed to make it happen.</i>

417
00:14:31,125 --> 00:14:33,917
Your office is only
one floor below Ron Howard's.

418
00:14:33,959 --> 00:14:35,333
Oh, yeah?

419
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:38,291
Must be a pretty important
project to him, then, huh?

420
00:14:38,333 --> 00:14:40,959
-That's one possibility.
-(bell dings)

421
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Watch your head.

422
00:14:43,041 --> 00:14:44,917
Are these ceilings
a little lower?

423
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:46,667
Brian and Ron
wanted the ceiling

424
00:14:46,709 --> 00:14:49,333
in their office to be
a few inches taller,

425
00:14:49,375 --> 00:14:51,250
but, apparently, Bruckheimer
knows someone on city council

426
00:14:51,291 --> 00:14:53,375
and they wouldn't let them
make the building taller.

427
00:14:53,417 --> 00:14:55,083
So Ron said,
"(bleep) you, Jerry,"

428
00:14:55,125 --> 00:14:57,375
and he went lower
with his floor.

429
00:14:57,417 --> 00:14:59,208
Everybody wins, huh?

430
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:01,542
-Here we are.
-Oh. That's me, huh?

431
00:15:01,583 --> 00:15:04,000
Oh. Ceilings
are even lower in here.

432
00:15:04,041 --> 00:15:06,917
Yeah, your office
is right below Brian's.

433
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:08,417
He wanted his ceiling

434
00:15:08,458 --> 00:15:10,125
just a few inches
taller than Ron's.

435
00:15:10,166 --> 00:15:12,166
-Okay.
-Some internal competition.

436
00:15:12,208 --> 00:15:14,208
-Kind of like between us.
-Yeah.

437
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:17,458
-Wait, what? 
-Well, you have
a family to track down.

438
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,583
Yeah, I do.
Hey, speaking of that...

439
00:15:19,625 --> 00:15:22,667
Kitty, is there... is there
a directory of actresses,

440
00:15:22,709 --> 00:15:24,667
-with pictures in it,
that I could... 
-Wow.

441
00:15:24,709 --> 00:15:26,625
Starting with the
casting couch already.

442
00:15:26,667 --> 00:15:28,000
No, no, no, no.
Nothing like that.

443
00:15:28,041 --> 00:15:29,458
I met... I met this
unbelievable woman

444
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:31,333
that would be perfect
for the part of my wife.

445
00:15:31,375 --> 00:15:33,041
And even if she
isn't, I'd love

446
00:15:33,083 --> 00:15:34,458
to track her down, so...

447
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,250
an actual couch could
be useful, please.

448
00:15:36,291 --> 00:15:37,500
Okay, you're funny.

449
00:15:37,542 --> 00:15:38,792
This is Imagine Entertainment,

450
00:15:38,834 --> 00:15:40,834
not the hot tub
at Bruckheimer Tower.

451
00:15:40,875 --> 00:15:42,542
We make family movies,

452
00:15:42,583 --> 00:15:44,166
you (bleep) (bleep)
(bleep) pig.

453
00:15:44,208 --> 00:15:46,250
-Okay.
-So, why don't you not worry

454
00:15:46,291 --> 00:15:48,375
about casting your movie,
and instead just get

455
00:15:48,417 --> 00:15:50,125
the rights to your family,
and, of course,

456
00:15:50,166 --> 00:15:52,834
if you need any help at all,
I would love to help you.

457
00:15:52,875 --> 00:15:54,750
-We like to pull together
around here. 
-Watch your back.

458
00:15:54,792 --> 00:15:56,709
No, you watch your back, mister!

459
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:58,333
If you screw up
this project for me,

460
00:15:58,375 --> 00:16:00,291
I will bury you
farther underground

461
00:16:00,333 --> 00:16:02,583
than I did your illiterate
little niece!

462
00:16:02,625 --> 00:16:04,333
Hi, guys.

463
00:16:04,375 --> 00:16:06,583
NARRATOR:<i> With Michael's movie</i>
<i>in jeopardy</i>

464
00:16:06,625 --> 00:16:10,125
<i>over the rights,</i>
<i>he decided to call in a favor.</i>

465
00:16:10,166 --> 00:16:11,834
MICHAEL:
<i>You know, we're making a movie</i>

466
00:16:11,875 --> 00:16:13,333
about the family, and I thought,

467
00:16:13,375 --> 00:16:14,709
"I wonder if Carl Weathers

468
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:16,250
would be willing
to help me out."

469
00:16:16,291 --> 00:16:18,417
-Let me ask you this
right up front. 
-Okay.

470
00:16:18,458 --> 00:16:21,041
Do you think
anybody would be upset

471
00:16:21,083 --> 00:16:23,291
if one of these Crinch
dolls took a walk?

472
00:16:23,333 --> 00:16:25,959
No, no, no, no,
help yourself.

473
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,375
I know what you're thinking.

474
00:16:27,417 --> 00:16:29,542
"What part
would I play in this?"

475
00:16:29,583 --> 00:16:31,583
I figured you'd
want me to play me.

476
00:16:31,625 --> 00:16:34,208
Well, I... I didn't want
to waste you on you.

477
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:36,041
In fact, I wasn't even going
to talk to you about acting,

478
00:16:36,083 --> 00:16:38,208
but if you are game,
boy, that would be great.

479
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:39,417
Let's circle back to that.

480
00:16:39,458 --> 00:16:41,333
There's a television show,
was it,

481
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:44,000
that you made
about my family.

482
00:16:44,041 --> 00:16:47,000
NARRATOR:<i> Michael was referring</i>
<i>to the George Bluth Sr. episode</i>

483
00:16:47,041 --> 00:16:50,208
<i>of a horribly narrated</i>
<i>crime reenactment series</i>

484
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:51,834
<i>called</i> Scandalmakers

485
00:16:51,875 --> 00:16:54,000
<i>that Carl had directed</i>
<i>years earlier.</i>

486
00:16:54,041 --> 00:16:56,250
Did you retain the rights
to my father's story?

487
00:16:56,291 --> 00:16:58,041
Nah, man, rights cost money.

488
00:16:58,083 --> 00:16:59,375
I never bothered
with that stuff.

489
00:16:59,417 --> 00:17:00,792
I figure you go ahead,
you shoot it.

490
00:17:00,834 --> 00:17:03,583
Better to ask for forgiveness
than beg for permission.

491
00:17:03,625 --> 00:17:05,458
NARRATOR:
<i>As it turned out, Carl</i>

492
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:07,667
<i>had never bothered</i>
<i>to get either,</i>

493
00:17:07,709 --> 00:17:09,417
<i>which is why he made himself</i>
<i>the subject</i>

494
00:17:09,458 --> 00:17:11,959
<i>of the final episode</i>
<i>of the series.</i>

495
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,959
Lee Nails, only pressed on once.
(chuckles)

496
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,959
Carl, we're
at a swap meet.

497
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,709
Okay.
There he is.

498
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:20,500
-Carl Weathers.
-Mr. Weathers-- Carl Weathers.

499
00:17:20,542 --> 00:17:22,792
You've been accused
of producing a television show

500
00:17:22,834 --> 00:17:24,875
based on real-life events
for which you've done

501
00:17:24,917 --> 00:17:29,041
none of the due diligence
in securing the rights thereto.

502
00:17:29,083 --> 00:17:30,667
I only have one question.

503
00:17:30,709 --> 00:17:32,125
Can I have your rights?

504
00:17:32,166 --> 00:17:33,458
-Of course.
-Of course, Carl Weathers.

505
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:34,959
CARL:
Cut!

506
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,750
Now we'll move on,
do a little voice-over.

507
00:17:36,792 --> 00:17:37,875
How much are these belts?

508
00:17:37,917 --> 00:17:39,667
-Oh, oh, oh, God.
-DeBrie!

509
00:17:39,709 --> 00:17:41,375
Her heart stopped.
She's (bleep) dying.

510
00:17:41,417 --> 00:17:43,625
Oh, hey, Dave,
you shaved, I like it.

511
00:17:43,667 --> 00:17:45,208
Please get the paddles!

512
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:46,917
Oh, hey, Mike.
How was Ojai?

513
00:17:46,959 --> 00:17:48,250
MICHAEL:
<i>But, Carl, the whole point</i>

514
00:17:48,291 --> 00:17:50,083
of the movie is that
it's a true story,

515
00:17:50,125 --> 00:17:51,166
so I need the rights.

516
00:17:51,208 --> 00:17:52,625
-(laughing)
-Don't I?

517
00:17:52,667 --> 00:17:56,166
Man, you're as green
as old lady Crinch.

518
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:59,291
Come on, people don't go
to movies to see rights.

519
00:17:59,333 --> 00:18:01,375
People go to movies
to see actors.

520
00:18:01,417 --> 00:18:03,417
Now, who you got
as scriptwriter?

521
00:18:03,458 --> 00:18:04,500
NARRATOR:<i> And that's</i>
<i>when Michael remembered</i>

522
00:18:04,542 --> 00:18:06,583
<i>that he did know one member</i>

523
00:18:06,625 --> 00:18:08,667
<i>-of the Writers Guild.</i>
-The eye is falling
off this one.

524
00:18:08,709 --> 00:18:11,291
You mind if I swap it out,
you know, for the restaurant?

525
00:18:11,333 --> 00:18:12,458
Swap it.

526
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:13,750
<i>And I thought, who's going</i>

527
00:18:13,792 --> 00:18:15,625
<i>to get it right the first time?</i>

528
00:18:15,667 --> 00:18:17,166
Because I don't want
to give a lot of notes.

529
00:18:17,208 --> 00:18:18,709
And then it came to me.

530
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:21,333
Who knows my father better
than Warden Gentles?

531
00:18:21,375 --> 00:18:24,792
Hold on one second.

532
00:18:24,834 --> 00:18:26,834
"The first time."

533
00:18:26,875 --> 00:18:27,959
Yeah.

534
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,125
My grandson gave me this,

535
00:18:29,166 --> 00:18:30,834
but I guarantee you,
give me an old Royal

536
00:18:30,875 --> 00:18:32,375
and a glass of Scotch,
and I'll give you

537
00:18:32,417 --> 00:18:35,667
250 pages where
the lightning hits the tree.

538
00:18:35,709 --> 00:18:37,625
-That's not what we do here.
-I mean,

539
00:18:37,667 --> 00:18:38,875
where the drop hits the pond.

540
00:18:38,917 --> 00:18:40,250
-That's it.
-I apologize.

541
00:18:40,291 --> 00:18:41,583
I've had a few meetings today.

542
00:18:41,625 --> 00:18:42,583
<i>Then...</i>

543
00:18:42,625 --> 00:18:44,041
the yellow robot gets mad

544
00:18:44,083 --> 00:18:45,333
at the pink robot--

545
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:47,041
-That does...
-correction...

546
00:18:47,083 --> 00:18:48,458
the purple robot.

547
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:51,333
Sorry, I'm,
I'm back to back today.

548
00:18:51,375 --> 00:18:52,417
I bet.

549
00:18:52,458 --> 00:18:53,667
I'm gonna be honest with you.

550
00:18:53,709 --> 00:18:54,875
You're not charring my tree,

551
00:18:54,917 --> 00:18:57,291
and... yeah,

552
00:18:57,333 --> 00:18:59,250
Jerry's not gonna come
off the boat for this one.

553
00:18:59,291 --> 00:19:00,875
MICHAEL:<i> This is basically</i>
<i>a story about</i>

554
00:19:00,917 --> 00:19:02,792
-Mm-hmm.
-a fellow like myself

555
00:19:02,834 --> 00:19:04,083
-and his father
-Mm-hmm.

556
00:19:04,125 --> 00:19:05,417
and their friend Carl Weathers.

557
00:19:05,458 --> 00:19:07,208
I'm not entirely sure

558
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:10,542
how to organically work him
into the, to the story.

559
00:19:10,583 --> 00:19:11,834
Uh, you know,
maybe he's teaching them

560
00:19:11,875 --> 00:19:13,625
lessons or something.

561
00:19:13,667 --> 00:19:16,041
Anyway, I'm gonna leave that
up to your capable hands.

562
00:19:16,083 --> 00:19:18,834
Wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait a minute.

563
00:19:18,875 --> 00:19:19,959
I've turned it off again.

564
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,959
Yeah, those are tricky.

565
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,291
Might I suggest

566
00:19:23,333 --> 00:19:25,375
bringing in someone younger
to play the father--

567
00:19:25,417 --> 00:19:27,166
a Philip Seymour Hoffman type?

568
00:19:27,208 --> 00:19:29,125
A Philip Seymour Hoffman type.

569
00:19:29,166 --> 00:19:30,125
<i>And so, naturally,</i>

570
00:19:30,166 --> 00:19:31,333
I-I thought of you.

571
00:19:31,375 --> 00:19:33,125
Well, you know,
I'm a married man,

572
00:19:33,166 --> 00:19:34,625
so I don't really
keep a directory

573
00:19:34,667 --> 00:19:36,500
of attractive young
actresses around.

574
00:19:36,542 --> 00:19:38,417
-Okay.
-I mean, are you really planning

575
00:19:38,458 --> 00:19:41,250
on using her, or is it like
Conan with the girl writers?

576
00:19:41,291 --> 00:19:42,709
It doesn't matter, it...

577
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:44,291
I-I'm here to talk
to you about a movie

578
00:19:44,333 --> 00:19:45,750
that we're gonna make
about the family,

579
00:19:45,792 --> 00:19:47,125
and I thought
that it might be really fun

580
00:19:47,166 --> 00:19:48,583
for us to work together again.

581
00:19:48,625 --> 00:19:50,875
Help me remember.
What did we do together?

582
00:19:50,917 --> 00:19:53,250
You came over for a chicken
and ham-water dinner

583
00:19:53,291 --> 00:19:55,333
that my family threw to raise
some funds for itself.

584
00:19:55,375 --> 00:19:56,959
And they're finally
getting around

585
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,583
to making a movie
of that, huh?

586
00:19:58,625 --> 00:19:59,917
There's more to it
than that.

587
00:19:59,959 --> 00:20:01,333
It's, it's about
a young man trying

588
00:20:01,375 --> 00:20:04,000
to get out from under
his domineering father

589
00:20:04,041 --> 00:20:05,792
while dealing
with the slow death of his wife.

590
00:20:05,834 --> 00:20:07,458
That just saved me 12 bucks.

591
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:09,583
I'm not going to see it.

592
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:11,542
I'm not asking you to see it;
I'd like for you to be in it.

593
00:20:11,583 --> 00:20:14,041
No offense, I have a job.
I mean, I have a good thing.

594
00:20:14,083 --> 00:20:15,333
-Oh, hey, Mr. O'Brien.
-Hey, how's it going?

595
00:20:15,375 --> 00:20:17,250
-Real good.
-Andy, quick note.

596
00:20:17,291 --> 00:20:19,834
Uh, just 'cause I look at you
when we're doing the show

597
00:20:19,875 --> 00:20:22,166
and ask you a question doesn't
mean you have to respond.

598
00:20:22,208 --> 00:20:24,041
Sometimes it's funny
when you don't say anything,

599
00:20:24,083 --> 00:20:26,375
and the audience gets
to think, "Hey,

600
00:20:26,417 --> 00:20:28,000
Andy really is stupid."

601
00:20:28,041 --> 00:20:29,166
(laughs)

602
00:20:29,208 --> 00:20:30,792
-Gets a big laugh.
-(chuckles)

603
00:20:30,834 --> 00:20:32,583
-Hey, you're new.
-I've been here a year.

604
00:20:32,625 --> 00:20:34,792
(laughing):
And you're funny, too.

605
00:20:34,834 --> 00:20:36,166
Let's get you set up
in a writer's office.

606
00:20:36,208 --> 00:20:38,000
Oh, you can have Andy's
if you don't mind

607
00:20:38,041 --> 00:20:39,709
the smell of bologna.

608
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:41,500
I'm in.

Oh, I thought
that was playing in here.

-Hi.
-Did you get the signatures?

620
00:21:03,333 --> 00:21:06,000
Better-- I put together
the core team: acting

621

-and writing.
-ANDY: You guys do remember

622

-It is happening.
-It's happening.

626
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:16,917
Dude, you are moving
way too fast.

627
00:21:16,959 --> 00:21:18,792
Maybe by Hollywood standards,

628
00:21:18,834 --> 00:21:20,834
you know, but, Kitty, I come
from the business community,

629
00:21:20,875 --> 00:21:23,875
where sometimes you have to
show it to him already built.

630
00:21:23,917 --> 00:21:25,709
Still think
you're going to bury me?

631
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:28,875
Well, Michael, you may not
have your father's signature,

632
00:21:28,917 --> 00:21:31,291
but you sure have
his signature style.

633
00:21:31,333 --> 00:21:32,750
Cue the music.

634
00:21:34,041 --> 00:21:36,625

N-No, we're here
to see Ron Howard.

This is the untitled
Michael B. project.

642
00:21:49,834 --> 00:21:51,542
I'm actually a producer here.
How are you?

643
00:21:51,583 --> 00:21:52,792
I've got the office
just below the sunken

644
00:21:52,834 --> 00:21:54,166
living room there
in Brian's.

645
00:21:54,208 --> 00:21:55,792
We're here to pitch
Ron the movie.

I'm sorry, sir, this is
a restricted floor.

RON:
Louisa, it's all right.

648
00:21:58,917 --> 00:22:01,125
For crying out loud,
I'm not the king of England.

00:22:01,166 --> 00:22:03,333
-Ah, there he is, hey, Ron.
-Oh, did you get that signature?

650
00:22:03,375 --> 00:22:05,083
You know, I've got
something better--

651
00:22:05,125 --> 00:22:06,500
take a look.

652
00:22:06,542 --> 00:22:08,166
Andy Richter?

653
00:22:08,208 --> 00:22:10,333
I'm out, (bleep) it, I'm out.

654
00:22:10,375 --> 00:22:12,000
Not married to Andy,

655
00:22:12,041 --> 00:22:14,417
-but what I do have
is the writer. -Stephan Gentles,

656
00:22:14,458 --> 00:22:16,750
Warden, East Orange County
Department of Corrections

657
00:22:16,792 --> 00:22:20,667
and writer of multiple episodes
of<i> Rocko's Modern Life.</i>

658
00:22:20,709 --> 00:22:22,208
Well, everybody's got
to start somewhere.

659
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:25,041
(laughs)
As long as I don't end up there.

660
00:22:25,083 --> 00:22:27,709
I'll have 25 pages on your desk
by tomorrow morning.

661
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:29,208
Gosh, that's

662
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:30,750
-putting the cart
before the horse. 
-Oh, yeah.

663
00:22:30,792 --> 00:22:33,125
Loo-Look who I've got
to play Carl Weathers.

664
00:22:33,166 --> 00:22:34,208
Oh, is that Cuba?

665
00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:35,709
No, no, n-n-no,
that's not Cuba.

666
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:38,291
I did not want to
waste Cuba on Carl.

667
00:22:38,333 --> 00:22:39,667
This is Carl Weathers.

668
00:22:39,709 --> 00:22:41,583
Oh, sure, Carl.

669
00:22:41,625 --> 00:22:43,375
You know, I thought it was Cuba

670
00:22:43,417 --> 00:22:45,083
with the perfect
Carl Weathers makeup.

671
00:22:45,125 --> 00:22:48,291
No, no, no, no, Cuba doesn't
have that kind of range.

672
00:22:48,333 --> 00:22:50,834
The thing is, I really
do insist on controlling
the casting myself.

673
00:22:50,875 --> 00:22:52,250
-I get it. 
-I'm out.

674
00:22:52,291 --> 00:22:54,291
I thought maybe if you just saw
the whole team together.

675
00:22:54,333 --> 00:22:55,875
BRIAN:
Team, what team?

676
00:22:55,917 --> 00:22:57,333
I should be informed
of all meetings.

677
00:22:57,375 --> 00:22:58,792
Hey, Cuba, how you doing?

678
00:22:58,834 --> 00:23:00,834
Oh, Brian, you know Carl
Weathers, Andy Richter,

679
00:23:00,875 --> 00:23:02,542
Stephan Gentles,
and Michael Bluth.

680
00:23:06,959 --> 00:23:09,125
I'm gonna skip this one.

681
00:23:09,166 --> 00:23:10,709
Good to see you, Brian.

682
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:12,834
You know, Ron, I think
it might be easier to talk

683
00:23:12,875 --> 00:23:14,583
if we just come up
just the rest of the way.

684
00:23:14,625 --> 00:23:16,166
Oh, thanks.

685
00:23:16,208 --> 00:23:18,709
Yeah, the elevator's been kooky
since we lowered the floor...

686
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:20,500
but maybe once you
get that signature.

687
00:23:20,542 --> 00:23:21,959
It might be kind of tricky.

688
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,458
They're all down
in Orange County.

689
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:25,375
-Tough to get down there.
-Oh, hey, B.

690
00:23:25,417 --> 00:23:26,959
-Yeah. 
-We must have an office
down there somewhere.

691
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Yeah, we'll stick you someplace.

692
00:23:28,041 --> 00:23:29,125
Yeah.

693
00:23:29,166 --> 00:23:30,291
We'll stick you someplace.

694
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:37,000
NARRATOR:
<i>Michael was starting work</i>

695
00:23:37,041 --> 00:23:39,208
<i>at his new show business office</i>

696
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:41,709
<i>-at Orange County Imagine. </i>
-Charles Dawkins.

697
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:44,709
<i>And his office was already</i>
<i>receiving a lot of visitors.</i>

698
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:46,875
Don't get comfortable.
Sir, thank you, no.

699
00:23:46,917 --> 00:23:48,291
<i>But mostly because</i>
<i>of the sign's similarity</i>

700
00:23:48,333 --> 00:23:50,000
<i>to that of this institution,</i>

701
00:23:50,041 --> 00:23:52,583
<i>which also received</i>
<i>some confused visitors.</i>

702
00:23:52,625 --> 00:23:53,875
An embolism?

703
00:23:53,917 --> 00:23:55,458
I-I was just here
to pitch a game show.

704
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:57,750
Go right out this way,
sir, thank you.

705
00:23:57,792 --> 00:23:58,959
-But can I leave a sample?
-It's generous

706
00:23:59,041 --> 00:24:01,000
of you, but they're gonna be
much better

707
00:24:01,041 --> 00:24:03,291
with it down there
at Imaging.

708
00:24:03,333 --> 00:24:05,583
<i>And that's when Michael got</i>
<i>his most unexpected visitor.</i>

709
00:24:09,083 --> 00:24:11,417
Dad, what are you doing here?

710
00:24:11,458 --> 00:24:15,333
I wanted to speak
to you in person.

711
00:24:15,375 --> 00:24:17,333
I think that you're
a little late, okay?

712
00:24:17,375 --> 00:24:20,875
Because I went to you
for a simple signature,

713
00:24:20,917 --> 00:24:23,709
not so I could just make
a movie about the family,

714
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:25,250
but so that I can move on
with my life,

715
00:24:25,291 --> 00:24:27,166
and you told me to go to hell.

716
00:24:27,208 --> 00:24:29,083
Yeah, you know, sometimes,
when I'm caught off guard,

717
00:24:29,125 --> 00:24:31,458
I say things I don't mean.

718
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:33,083
This is a horrible
little office.

719
00:24:33,125 --> 00:24:34,750
So you're here to apologize,
is that right?

720
00:24:34,792 --> 00:24:37,750
Yes, and I, uh, brought
you a peace offering.

721
00:24:37,792 --> 00:24:39,959
<i>Tetas Gigantes?</i>

722
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,125
You hate it, right?

723
00:24:41,166 --> 00:24:42,709
Well, it's,
it's Mexican porn.

724
00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:45,125
You know, you are
impossible to buy for.

725
00:24:45,166 --> 00:24:46,458
Just, uh, give it to me.

726
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:47,667
-No, no, oh.
-No, no, no, give...

727
00:24:47,709 --> 00:24:49,417
-No, no, no.
-See, this is the (bleep) kayak

728
00:24:49,458 --> 00:24:51,125
-all over again.
-Dad, I apologize.

729
00:24:51,166 --> 00:24:53,083
I was saying it was
a very original gift.

730
00:24:53,125 --> 00:24:54,500
No, no, no.
You'll never use it.

731
00:24:54,542 --> 00:24:57,250
I will use it, except
for maybe<i> Señor Señoritas.</i>

732
00:24:57,291 --> 00:24:59,125
I live in Mexico now

733
00:24:59,166 --> 00:25:01,375
and I, I don't always
know how to ask

734
00:25:01,417 --> 00:25:02,917
-exactly for what I want.
-Understandable.

735
00:25:02,959 --> 00:25:04,667
And that's almost over now,

736
00:25:04,709 --> 00:25:08,542
which is what I came
to talk to you about.

737
00:25:08,583 --> 00:25:10,083
Do you know a guy
named Herbert Love?

738
00:25:10,125 --> 00:25:11,417
I know a lot of people, sure,

739
00:25:11,458 --> 00:25:13,250
'cause I'm a big producer now.

740
00:25:13,291 --> 00:25:14,792
-Yeah?
-He ate a mouse.

741
00:25:14,834 --> 00:25:17,291
Let's grab a coffee.

742
00:25:17,333 --> 00:25:18,959
Okay, so I guess things
haven't been going

743
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,542
that well for me.

744
00:25:20,583 --> 00:25:22,875
And you didn't feel
you could tell me that?

745
00:25:22,917 --> 00:25:24,250
That's why I haven't
heard from you?

746
00:25:24,291 --> 00:25:26,125
I guess I was afraid
that if I admitted

747
00:25:26,166 --> 00:25:27,583
Sudden Valley
was a failure...

748
00:25:27,625 --> 00:25:30,166
-Told you so. 
-...you might say,
"I told you so."

749
00:25:30,208 --> 00:25:33,458
Well, then, you don't
know me at all.

750
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:35,375
It's all right, it's my fault. I
bit off more than I could chew.

751
00:25:35,417 --> 00:25:37,041
I mean, I lied
about being a big shot

752
00:25:37,083 --> 00:25:40,250
to impress this girl
whose name I don't even know.

753
00:25:40,291 --> 00:25:43,417
I've got this crazy idea
that I'm gonna turn into a star

754
00:25:43,458 --> 00:25:45,917
with a film that I can't
get made 'cause I can't get

755
00:25:45,959 --> 00:25:47,458
my own father's signature
on, on, on a release.

756
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:49,041
-It's like, you know...
-Shh, shh, shh...

757
00:25:49,083 --> 00:25:53,583
I didn't know it was
about lying to a girl.

758
00:25:53,625 --> 00:25:56,583
Give me the release.

759
00:25:56,625 --> 00:25:57,834
You'd do this for me?

760
00:25:57,875 --> 00:25:59,875
Of course I will.

761
00:25:59,917 --> 00:26:01,834
NARRATOR:<i> And so, with his</i>
<i>father's rights in hand,</i>

762
00:26:01,875 --> 00:26:03,875
<i>Michael the producer headed up</i>

763
00:26:03,917 --> 00:26:06,458
<i>to find his lady</i>
<i>"Cinderella Man"</i>

764
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:08,000
<i>at the Ealing Club,</i>

765
00:26:08,041 --> 00:26:09,792
<i>an exclusive show business</i>
<i>hangout.</i>

766
00:26:09,834 --> 00:26:11,000
Ron Howard.

767
00:26:11,041 --> 00:26:12,667
Oh, thank you.

768
00:26:12,709 --> 00:26:15,125
No, it's Michael Bluth. Hi.

769
00:26:15,166 --> 00:26:16,667
Oh, I remember.

770
00:26:16,709 --> 00:26:18,333
I did it.

771
00:26:18,375 --> 00:26:19,458
I got my father's signature.

772
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:20,917
You know, you said
you wanted to focus

773
00:26:20,959 --> 00:26:22,333
on the father-son relationship,
and I love it.

774
00:26:22,375 --> 00:26:23,959
Who's not going to
be able to relate

775
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,333
to a son standing up to
his self-centered father?

776
00:26:25,375 --> 00:26:26,834
Sure.

777
00:26:26,875 --> 00:26:28,458
But the father-son relationship
I was interested in

778
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:32,250
was not you and your father,
it was you and your son.

779
00:26:32,291 --> 00:26:34,458
You're the father.

780
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:37,208
But that would make
my son the son.

781
00:26:37,250 --> 00:26:38,542
Bingo.

782
00:26:38,583 --> 00:26:40,166
NARRATOR:
<i>Michael had to decide</i>

783
00:26:40,208 --> 00:26:42,375
<i>whether being a producer</i>
<i>was worth invading</i>

784
00:26:42,417 --> 00:26:46,625
<i>the privacy of a son who had</i>
<i>kicked him out for that reason.</i>

785
00:26:46,667 --> 00:26:48,041
I don't think I can do it.
I don't think I can go...

786
00:26:48,083 --> 00:26:49,792
I can't go to my son.

787
00:26:49,834 --> 00:26:52,291
That's, uh-- I just--
I don't even think

788
00:26:52,333 --> 00:26:54,583
that it's worth it just to say
that I'm a producer, like...

789
00:26:54,625 --> 00:26:56,000
-It's your call.
-Yeah.

790
00:26:56,041 --> 00:26:59,750
Maybe the real estate business
will come around soon.

791
00:26:59,792 --> 00:27:01,917
Will it?

792
00:27:01,959 --> 00:27:05,750
I could never reveal that
information to a non-producer.

793
00:27:05,792 --> 00:27:07,083
NARRATOR:
<i>And then he heard something</i>

794
00:27:07,125 --> 00:27:09,250
<i>that made him change his mind.</i>

795
00:27:09,291 --> 00:27:10,709
Michael?

796
00:27:10,750 --> 00:27:13,000
Mr. Moobie Producer.

797
00:27:13,041 --> 00:27:14,291
That's me.

798
00:27:16,625 --> 00:27:19,875
NARRATOR:
<i>And like all bagpipe music,</i>

799
00:27:19,917 --> 00:27:22,417
<i>it was hard to tell if it was</i>
<i>good music played horribly</i>

800
00:27:22,458 --> 00:27:25,208
<i>or horrible music played well,</i>

801
00:27:25,250 --> 00:27:26,834
<i>but Michael was eager</i>
<i>to find out</i>

802
00:27:26,875 --> 00:27:29,083
<i>her name</i>
<i>when she was introduced</i>

803
00:27:29,125 --> 00:27:30,875
<i>at the end of the set.</i>

804
00:27:32,125 --> 00:27:33,458
And tonight on bagpipes...

805
00:27:34,250 --> 00:27:35,542
(goat bleats)

806
00:27:40,917 --> 00:27:42,625
NARRATOR:
-<i> But he got to know her anyway.</i>
<i>-</i> Fantastic.

807
00:27:42,667 --> 00:27:44,375
I'm only doing this
in between movies,

808
00:27:44,417 --> 00:27:47,041
which, given how badly I bombed
at that audition yesterday,

809
00:27:47,083 --> 00:27:48,750
it's going to be a while.

810
00:27:48,792 --> 00:27:50,291
Yeah, you shouldn't worry
about that, you're gonna get

811
00:27:50,333 --> 00:27:51,834
something.
You know, sometimes

812
00:27:51,875 --> 00:27:53,709
even students make films.

813
00:27:53,750 --> 00:27:55,083
(laughs)

814
00:27:55,125 --> 00:27:56,792
Yeah, that's really funny.

815
00:27:56,834 --> 00:27:58,834
I just could put
your name in for something.

816
00:27:58,875 --> 00:27:59,959
I do know Ron Howard.

817
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,333
(laughs)

818
00:28:02,375 --> 00:28:04,000
Love that I make
you laugh.

819
00:28:04,041 --> 00:28:06,250
You seriously would be
great for this part.

820
00:28:06,291 --> 00:28:08,083
You remind me of the person
that, that it's based on.

821
00:28:08,125 --> 00:28:10,583
Uh, she, she actually
dies on camera.

822
00:28:10,625 --> 00:28:11,583
Wow.

823
00:28:11,625 --> 00:28:13,041
Make her mentally challenged

824
00:28:13,083 --> 00:28:14,458
and I'll thank you
in my Oscar speech.

825
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:15,709
There's a part
like that, too,

826
00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:17,667
only she-she comes in later

827
00:28:17,709 --> 00:28:20,500
and she's British,
so she doesn't seem...

828
00:28:20,542 --> 00:28:22,291
No one could ever tell
that she's disabled.

829
00:28:22,333 --> 00:28:24,291
I haven't been in work mode
for a while to be honest.

830
00:28:24,333 --> 00:28:26,875
I've been, I've been
raising my son.

831
00:28:26,917 --> 00:28:28,333
Oh, you have a son?
I have a son.

832
00:28:28,375 --> 00:28:29,959
-You do? 
-Oh, yeah, we've got
a little issue,

833
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:30,959
though, right now.

834
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,125
Let me guess.

835
00:28:32,166 --> 00:28:33,625
He's pushing you away?

836
00:28:33,667 --> 00:28:35,542
-Yes.
-My son practically

837
00:28:35,583 --> 00:28:37,583
kicked me out of his school
the other day.

838
00:28:37,625 --> 00:28:40,000
That is literally
what my son did to me.

839
00:28:40,041 --> 00:28:41,542
Then I said to him,

840
00:28:41,583 --> 00:28:43,250
"You have no privacy from me."

841
00:28:43,291 --> 00:28:44,875
That's what I should do.

842
00:28:44,917 --> 00:28:46,208
Lem's six in August.

843
00:28:46,250 --> 00:28:47,208
Yours?

844
00:28:47,250 --> 00:28:49,083
-Seven in July.
-Aw...

845
00:28:49,125 --> 00:28:50,500
NARRATOR:
<i>Michael regretted the lie,</i>

846
00:28:50,542 --> 00:28:52,500
<i>so he sort of split</i>
<i>the difference.</i>

847
00:28:52,542 --> 00:28:54,959
Teen-- 17

848
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,208
-in July.
-Oh.

849
00:28:56,250 --> 00:28:57,667
They grow up so fast,
don't they?

850
00:28:57,709 --> 00:28:59,875
Oh, wow.

851
00:28:59,917 --> 00:29:02,625
Well, I guess you got to move
on with your life sometime.

852
00:29:03,709 --> 00:29:05,917
Yes.

853
00:29:05,959 --> 00:29:09,375
Yes, you do.

854
00:29:09,417 --> 00:29:11,375
Oh, n-no, you know what?

855
00:29:11,417 --> 00:29:14,250
I don't think that this
is-- it's not a good idea.

856
00:29:14,291 --> 00:29:16,000
This is a great idea.
Why don't you think this is

857
00:29:16,041 --> 00:29:17,709
-a great idea?
-'Cause people can see.

858
00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:19,542
-Nobody can see.
-Oh, God.

859
00:29:19,583 --> 00:29:21,542
Wow, you weren't kidding

860
00:29:21,583 --> 00:29:23,792
when you said you had
a part for me.

861
00:29:23,834 --> 00:29:25,500
-That was absolutely insane.
-Thanks.

862
00:29:25,542 --> 00:29:27,542
-I've never done anything
that crazy before.

863
00:29:27,583 --> 00:29:28,959
-Perfect. 
-I want to do
a lot more of that.

864
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,125
I want to see you again.

865
00:29:30,166 --> 00:29:31,875
I want to take you out
to a nice dinner.

866
00:29:31,917 --> 00:29:33,291
-Oh.
-So, then, uh...

867
00:29:33,333 --> 00:29:36,208
Well, this will have
to tide you over until then.

868
00:29:36,250 --> 00:29:37,959
Oh, look at those.

869
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,417
Boy, without this, I wouldn't
know you had a tattoo.

870
00:29:39,458 --> 00:29:40,709
Oh, anyone that gets
that much clothing

871
00:29:40,750 --> 00:29:42,583
off me better know my name.

872
00:29:42,625 --> 00:29:43,667
(moans)

873
00:29:43,709 --> 00:29:45,875
-Good night.
-Good night.

874
00:29:47,125 --> 00:29:50,917
NARRATOR:<i> And that's when</i>
<i>Michael finally saw her name.</i>

875
00:29:50,959 --> 00:29:52,625
Oh, my God.

876
00:29:54,917 --> 00:29:56,834
I'm dating
Ron Howard's girlfriend.

877
00:29:56,875 --> 00:29:59,083
NARRATOR:
<i>Actually she's his daughter.</i>

878
00:29:59,125 --> 00:30:02,709
<i>But that's kind of worse,</i>
<i>don't you think?</i>

879
00:30:06,667 --> 00:30:08,458
<i>Michael starts</i>
<i>to really learn the business.</i>

880
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:10,125
We can keep going around
another 20 minutes, if you want,

881
00:30:10,166 --> 00:30:11,583
but I know what
I'm talking about.

882
00:30:11,625 --> 00:30:14,083
I just went through this
last week with a guy.

883
00:30:14,125 --> 00:30:15,917
That is a hernia.

884
00:30:15,959 --> 00:30:17,667
I'm gonna send you to my guy
over at Hoag Hospital.

885
00:30:17,709 --> 00:30:18,917
They call him the
Bulge Whisperer.

886
00:30:18,959 --> 00:30:21,375
He does 20 of these a week.

887
00:30:21,417 --> 00:30:23,458
NARRATOR:<i> And after failing to</i>
<i>get back to Burbank on time,</i>

888
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:25,250
<i>Andy calls in a favor</i>

889
00:30:25,291 --> 00:30:26,792
<i>from his identical</i>
<i>quintuplet brother Rocky.</i>

890
00:30:26,834 --> 00:30:28,834
All right, my next guest
is a famous pilot

891
00:30:28,875 --> 00:30:32,333
who safely crashed his plane
into the Hudson River.

892
00:30:32,375 --> 00:30:33,792
That's kind of a
coincidence, Andy.

893
00:30:33,834 --> 00:30:36,458
We've got a pilot
who crashes planes,

894
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:39,417
and you're an actor
who crashes pilots.

895
00:30:39,458 --> 00:30:42,333
<i>And Rocky hurts two nice</i>
<i>red-haired guys' feelings...</i>

896
00:30:42,375 --> 00:30:44,083
Yeah, that's really funny.

897
00:30:44,125 --> 00:30:45,834
You know what else
would be funny?

898
00:30:45,875 --> 00:30:47,750
If I ripped that red rug
right off your head

899
00:30:47,792 --> 00:30:50,625
and turned you
into Ron Howard.

900
00:30:50,667 --> 00:30:53,667
<i>...while getting the biggest</i>
<i>laugh of Andy's career.</i>
