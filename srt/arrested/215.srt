narrator: NOW THE STORY 
OF A WEALTHY FAMILY

00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:04,170
WHO LOST EVERYTHING...

00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:05,755
AND THE ONE SON 
WHO HAD NO CHOICE...

4
00:00:05,755 --> 00:00:07,965
BUT TO KEEP THEM ALL TOGETHER.

5
00:00:13,138 --> 00:00:15,890
IT'S ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT.

6
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:22,063
narrator: MICHAEL BLUTH HAD JUST 
BEEN STUNNED TO DISCOVER...

7
00:00:22,063 --> 00:00:26,526
THAT A CONTRACT HIS COMPANY WAS 
COUNTING ON WAS BEING CUT BACK.

8
00:00:26,526 --> 00:00:28,528
- YOU INITIALLY TOLD US TO 
DESIGN AND BUILD 22 HOMES.

9
00:00:28,528 --> 00:00:30,405
NOW YOU'RE SAYING 18.

10
00:00:30,405 --> 00:00:32,240
THAT DOESN'T GIVE US ENOUGH 
CAPITAL TO COMPLETE THE JOB.

11
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:33,491
AND WE'VE ALREADY GOT

12
00:00:33,491 --> 00:00:34,659
THE BLUEPRINTS DRAWN UP 
AND EVERYTHING.

13
00:00:34,659 --> 00:00:37,620
narrator: WELL, THAT PART WASN'T 
TRUE. BUT THEY WOULD'VE.

14
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:38,871
[dial tone]

15
00:00:38,871 --> 00:00:39,914
- THAT WAS A VERY 
IMPORTANT PHONE CALL.

16
00:00:39,914 --> 00:00:41,166
- I DON'T HAVE MUCH TIME, 
MICHAEL.

17
00:00:41,166 --> 00:00:43,793
TOBIAS IS ABOUT TO WALK IN HERE 
ANY MINUTE ASKING FOR A JOB.

18
00:00:43,793 --> 00:00:45,836
I NEED YOU TO HIRE HIM. 
[ring, dial tone]

19
00:00:45,836 --> 00:00:47,088
- HI. I'M SOR--

20
00:00:47,088 --> 00:00:48,673
- LOOK, IT ISN'T MY IDEA, 
IT'S HIS.

21
00:00:48,673 --> 00:00:50,966
BUT I NEED A BREAK 
FROM MRS. FEATHERBOTTOM.

22
00:00:50,966 --> 00:00:52,218
narrator: SINCE MOVING OUT,

23
00:00:52,218 --> 00:00:55,346
TOBIAS HAD BEEN PRETENDING 
TO BE A BRITISH HOUSEKEEPER...

24
00:00:55,346 --> 00:00:56,597
AS A WAY TO BE CLOSE TO HIS 
FAMILY.

25
00:00:56,597 --> 00:00:58,099
- [singing in falsetto]

26
00:00:58,099 --> 00:01:00,143
narrator: HOWEVER, HIS DESIRE TO 
NOW BE DISCOVERED AS HIMSELF

27
00:01:00,143 --> 00:01:01,727
WAS BECOMING BOTHERSOME.

28
00:01:01,727 --> 00:01:02,978
- CAN'T YOU JUST TELL HIM

29
00:01:02,978 --> 00:01:05,648
YOU KNOW THAT HE'S MRS. 
FEATHERBOTTOM?

30
00:01:05,648 --> 00:01:07,608
- OH, NO. SHE'S THE ONLY ONE WHO 
CAN HAND WASH MY DELICATES.

31
00:01:07,608 --> 00:01:09,652
- YEAH, THE REAL TOBIAS 
WOULDN'T DO THAT.

32
00:01:09,652 --> 00:01:12,488
- WOULDN'T DO WHAT? 
- BE MICHAEL'S ASSISTANT.

33
00:01:12,488 --> 00:01:15,658
- WELL, THAT'S WHAT I CAME 
DOWN HERE TO ASK ABOUT.

34
00:01:15,658 --> 00:01:17,868
I THINK YOU'LL FIND ME 
MORE THAN QUALIFIED.

35
00:01:17,868 --> 00:01:19,120
- IT'S REALLY NOT THAT SIMPLE.

36
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:20,663
UH, YOU'D HAVE TO 
SUBMIT A RESUME.

37
00:01:20,663 --> 00:01:23,708
- BOOYAH!

38
00:01:23,708 --> 00:01:26,461
- WOW. GOBIAS INDUSTRIES. 
- GOBIAS.

39
00:01:26,461 --> 00:01:27,712
- RIGHT. 
I REMEMBER, YEAH.

40
00:01:27,712 --> 00:01:28,838
- AS IN "GO BUY US 
A CUP OF--"

41
00:01:28,838 --> 00:01:30,089
- YOU KNOW WHAT, 
LOOKS LIKE YOU MIGHT BE

42
00:01:30,089 --> 00:01:31,132
A LITTLE TOO QUALIFIED.

43
00:01:31,132 --> 00:01:32,675
- HANG ON. WHY DON'T YOU LET 
YOUR NEW ASSISTANT

44
00:01:32,675 --> 00:01:35,386
TAKE ALL THIS DOWN?

45
00:01:36,679 --> 00:01:38,306
- WOW, YOU ARE GUNG HO.

46
00:01:38,306 --> 00:01:39,557
- YOU'RE GETTING A NEW 
ASSISTANT?

47
00:01:39,557 --> 00:01:41,767
IS THIS BECAUSE THE ORDER 
WAS CUT BACK?

48
00:01:41,767 --> 00:01:43,603
- NO. BUT IF YOU ARE CONCERNED 
ABOUT KEEPING YOUR JOB,

49
00:01:43,603 --> 00:01:44,770
YOU MIGHT WANT TO FOCUS 
ON KEEPING

50
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:46,397
UNWANTED VISITORS 
OUT OF MY OFFICE.

51
00:01:46,397 --> 00:01:47,648
- I HAVE RABIES, MICHAEL.

52
00:01:47,648 --> 00:01:50,568
YOU KNOW THAT. TODAY WAS 
DAY FOUR OF MY SHOTS.

53
00:01:50,568 --> 00:01:52,570
narrator: 
STARLA HAD BEEN BITTEN BY

54
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:56,073
A WELL-KNOWN 
MUSIC PRODUCER'S GUARD DOG.

55
00:01:57,658 --> 00:02:00,035
- MICHAEL, STARLA TOLD US 
ABOUT THE CUTBACK.

56
00:02:00,035 --> 00:02:02,913
YOU KNOW, A LOT OF OUR OVERHEAD 
IS TIED UP IN THE FACT...

57
00:02:02,913 --> 00:02:04,624
WE ARE ON THE TOP FLOOR 
OF A VERY EXPENSIVE BUILDING.

58
00:02:04,624 --> 00:02:05,958
IF WE MOVE 
JUST ONE FLOOR LOWER--

59
00:02:05,958 --> 00:02:07,793
- TED, EVERYTHING'S FINE.

60
00:02:07,793 --> 00:02:10,588
I GOT IT ALL UNDER CONTROL, 
AND NOBODY NEEDS TO MOVE.

61
00:02:10,588 --> 00:02:13,299
- I'M SORRY. TED, IS IT? 
- YES.

62
00:02:13,299 --> 00:02:15,135
- TED. DID TED 
MAKE AN APPOINTMENT?

63
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:16,469
- NO, I JUST WORK 
DOWN THE HALL AND--

64
00:02:16,469 --> 00:02:17,470
- NO.

65
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:20,140
- WELL, THEN, TED CAN GET 
THE HELL OUT OF THIS OFFICE!

66
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:24,018
- I'M TALKING-- 
- YOU GET THE HELL OUT!

67
00:02:24,018 --> 00:02:25,895
AND THAT'S HOW YOU 
KEEP OUT UNWANTED VISITORS.

68
00:02:25,895 --> 00:02:27,188
- THANK YOU.

69
00:02:27,188 --> 00:02:30,566
- ALTHOUGH, IF I MAY, LET ME 
TAKE OFF MY ASSISTANT SKIRT...

70
00:02:30,566 --> 00:02:34,028
AND PUT ON MY BARBRA STREISAND 
IN "THE PRINCE OF TIDES"

71
00:02:34,028 --> 00:02:36,489
ASS-MASKING THERAPIST PANTSUIT.

72
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:37,740
- WHAT?

73
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:39,284
- THE REASON THAT YOU 
CAN'T ACCEPT MY HELP...

74
00:02:39,284 --> 00:02:42,328
IS THE SAME REASON YOU CAN'T 
HEAR THAT GENTLEMAN'S IDEA--

75
00:02:42,328 --> 00:02:45,873
BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO BE IN 
TOTAL CONTROL OF EVERYTHING.

76
00:02:45,873 --> 00:02:48,834
AND IT'S GOING TO MAKE 
YOU SICK IF YOU CAN'T LET GO.

77
00:02:48,834 --> 00:02:51,337
- HEY, I'M FINE. 
- OH?

78
00:02:51,337 --> 00:02:52,588
- OH! OOH!

79
00:02:52,588 --> 00:02:54,465
- SEE? HE'S RIGHT. 
YOU'VE GOT A CONTROL PROBLEM.

80
00:02:54,465 --> 00:02:57,635
BUT I KNOW THIS EASTERN MEDICINE 
STORE, ANCIENT CHINESE SECRET.

81
00:02:57,635 --> 00:03:00,095
- both: ANCIENT CHINESE SECRET, 
HUH?

82
00:03:00,095 --> 00:03:01,472
- I SENT GOB THERE 
FOR HIS MIGRAINES.

83
00:03:01,472 --> 00:03:03,224
- IT'S JUST A CRAMP. 
I'M FINE.

84
00:03:03,224 --> 00:03:04,475
narrator: 
IN FACT, GOB WAS AT

85
00:03:04,475 --> 00:03:06,936
ANCIENT CHINESE SECRET 
AT THAT MOMENT,

86
00:03:06,936 --> 00:03:08,187
BUT NOT FOR A MIGRAINE.

87
00:03:08,187 --> 00:03:12,692
- YEAH, I NEED A TEA TO 
GIVE MY DINGLE LESS TINGLE.

88
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:14,944
ME QUICK, WANT SLOW. 
WAIT, THAT'S INDIAN.

89
00:03:14,944 --> 00:03:19,365
- TEA FOR DONG. 
- [speaking native language]

90
00:03:19,365 --> 00:03:20,616
- SWEET BLADE.

91
00:03:20,616 --> 00:03:23,578
- IT'S THE SWORD OF DESTINY. 
IT'S FULL OF ANCIENT MAGIC.

92
00:03:23,578 --> 00:03:27,957
- OH, YEAH? 
YOU INTO MAGIC?

93
00:03:27,957 --> 00:03:30,084
STILL, WHERE'D 
THE LIGHTER FLUID COME FROM?

94
00:03:30,084 --> 00:03:31,711
SO, IS IT FOR SALE? 
I COULD USE IT IN MY ACT.

95
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:33,045
- MAYBE.

96
00:03:33,045 --> 00:03:36,048
SWORD OF DESTINY 
HUNDREDS OF YEARS OLD.

97
00:03:36,048 --> 00:03:38,843
COME WITH ANCIENT STORY 
OF WARNING AND--

98
00:03:38,843 --> 00:03:40,094
- YEAH, I MAKE UP MY OWN PATTER.

99
00:03:40,094 --> 00:03:42,054
JUST RING IT UP 
WITH THE DONG TEA.

100
00:03:42,054 --> 00:03:44,014
narrator: 
AND GOB CAUGHT UP WITH MICHAEL.

101
00:03:44,014 --> 00:03:45,266
- MICHAEL. 
BEEN LOOKIN' FOR YOU.

102
00:03:45,266 --> 00:03:49,645
- LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE LOOKING 
FOR DRAGONS, IN THE FUTURE.

103
00:03:49,645 --> 00:03:52,273
- I WOULDN'T MOCK THE SWORD OF 
DESTINY, MICHAEL.

104
00:03:52,273 --> 00:03:54,692
- CAREFUL WITH THAT, GOB.

105
00:03:54,692 --> 00:03:56,694
- BLEEDING? 
- NOPE.

106
00:03:56,694 --> 00:03:57,945
YEAH, THAT'S BLOOD.

107
00:03:57,945 --> 00:04:00,072
IT'LL GET BETTER 
BEFORE THE SHOW.

108
00:04:00,072 --> 00:04:01,741
THAT'S WHAT 
I NEED YOU FOR, MICHAEL.

109
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:03,784
I CAN'T PERFORM MY ILLUSION 
AT THE GOTHIC CASTLE

110
00:04:03,784 --> 00:04:06,036
BECAUSE I'VE BEEN BANNED 
FROM THE MAGICIANS' ALLIANCE.

111
00:04:06,036 --> 00:04:07,580
I NEED YOU TO 
REGISTER AS THE MAGICIAN,

112
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:10,625
AND I'M THE LOWLY ASSISTANT.

113
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:11,876
THEN WE GET ON THE STAGE,

114
00:04:11,876 --> 00:04:14,420
AND YOU RAM THE SWORD OF DESTINY 
INTO MY BELLY.

115
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:15,671
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

116
00:04:15,671 --> 00:04:17,298
- REALLY PICKED UP STEAM THERE 
AT THE END, BUT I CAN'T.

117
00:04:17,298 --> 00:04:19,091
I'VE GOTTA TEACH GEORGE MICHAEL 
HOW TO DRIVE.

118
00:04:19,091 --> 00:04:20,718
AND THEN I GOTTA 
GET RIGHT BACK HERE, BECAUSE--

119
00:04:20,718 --> 00:04:22,512
- MICHAEL, IF I MAKE 
THIS COMEBACK,

120
00:04:22,512 --> 00:04:24,722
I'LL BUY YOU 100 GEORGE MICHAELS 
YOU CAN TEACH TO DRIVE!

121
00:04:24,722 --> 00:04:26,056
- YOU'RE LOSING BLOOD, 
AREN'T YOU?

122
00:04:26,056 --> 00:04:27,350
- PROBABLY. 
MY SOCKS ARE WET.

123
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:29,352
- SORRY.

124
00:04:29,352 --> 00:04:30,978
- YOU'LL BE SORRY!

125
00:04:30,978 --> 00:04:33,398
WAIT, THAT DOESN'T WORK 
AFTER HIS LINE.

126
00:04:33,398 --> 00:04:36,401
narrator: AND MICHAEL RUSHED 
HOME TO TEACH HIS SON TO DRIVE.

127
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:39,111
- KNOCK, KNOCK. HEY, MAEBY. 
GEORGE MICHAEL, READY TO DRIVE?

128
00:04:39,111 --> 00:04:41,739
I DON'T HAVE MUCH TIME. 
- GET ME BEHIND THAT WHEEL.

129
00:04:41,739 --> 00:04:43,741
- OH, NO, YOU WILL 
NOT BE BEHIND THE WHEEL.

130
00:04:43,741 --> 00:04:46,369
YOU'LL OBSERVE ME WHILE I 
DEMONSTRATE SOME THINGS, OKAY?

131
00:04:46,369 --> 00:04:47,745
I'LL BE QUIZZING YOU TOO, 
HOTSHOT.

132
00:04:47,745 --> 00:04:49,747
I'M GONNA GO GRAB 
THE VIDEO CAMERA.

133
00:04:49,747 --> 00:04:52,333
AND THEN, SCHOOL'S IN. 
- I'D SKIP.

134
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:54,335
- WELL, NO, I NEED TO LEARN.

135
00:04:54,335 --> 00:04:56,128
YOU CAN'T GET AROUND ANYWHERE 
WITHOUT A DRIVER'S LICENSE.

136
00:04:56,128 --> 00:04:58,255
narrator: ACTUALLY, MAEBY 
HAD RECEIVED A COMPANY CAR

137
00:04:58,255 --> 00:05:00,508
FROM THE MOVIE STUDIO...

138
00:05:00,508 --> 00:05:03,636
WHERE SHE WAS SECRETLY 
POSING AS AN EXECUTIVE.

139
00:05:10,518 --> 00:05:16,357
BUT CURRENTLY, GEORGE SR. WAS IN 
THE ATTIC MAKING A VIDEOTAPE--

140
00:05:16,357 --> 00:05:17,608
- THIS IS MY DEMAND.

141
00:05:17,608 --> 00:05:19,444
narrator: 
WHEN MICHAEL FOUND HIM.

142
00:05:19,444 --> 00:05:21,612
- WHAT'S THE DEAL 
WITH THE TURBAN?

143
00:05:21,612 --> 00:05:24,532
- HUH? [chuckles] 
PRETTY SMART, HUH?

144
00:05:24,532 --> 00:05:27,493
AND-AND IT'S WARM TOO. 
- GUESS THAT MAKES SENSE.

145
00:05:27,493 --> 00:05:29,161
- OH, HEY, I HEARD ABOUT 
THAT REDUCED ORDER.

146
00:05:29,161 --> 00:05:31,038
THOSE BASTARDS.

147
00:05:31,038 --> 00:05:34,124
THIS VIDEOTAPE 
IS FOR OUR EMPLOYEES.

148
00:05:34,124 --> 00:05:35,376
YOU TAKE THIS AND PLAY IT.

149
00:05:35,376 --> 00:05:39,464
THIS WILL REASSURE THEM 
THAT SOMEONE IS IN CHARGE.

150
00:05:39,464 --> 00:05:41,298
- WELL, SOMEONE IS IN CHARGE, 
DAD. I'M IN CHARGE.

151
00:05:41,298 --> 00:05:42,800
I'VE NEVER 
EVEN TAKEN A SICK DAY.

152
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,844
- NO, A REAL AUTHORITY.

153
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:47,555
MY PRESENCE NEEDS 
TO BE, UH, REINSTATED.

154
00:05:47,555 --> 00:05:50,725
narrator: HIS FIRST EFFORT AT 
DOING SO HAD ALREADY FAILED.

155
00:05:50,725 --> 00:05:53,519
- WHEN DO YOU START 
BEING MY MOLE AT MY COMPANY?

156
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:55,730
- ACTUALLY, MICHAEL TURNED ME 
DOWN FOR THE JOB.

157
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:56,981
- WHAT?

158
00:05:56,981 --> 00:05:59,066
- SOMETHING TO DO WITH THEIR 
HOUSING ORDER BEING CUT BACK.

159
00:05:59,066 --> 00:06:03,320
- OH, MY GOD, THAT'S A HORRIBLE 
SIGN-- OW! DAMN IT!

160
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:06,491
- I'M THE AUTHORITY, 
SO I WILL SAVE THE COMPANY.

161
00:06:06,491 --> 00:06:09,410
AND I SAY NO VIDEOTAPE. 
OOH!

162
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:10,661
- OH, YOU OUGHTA TAKE A SICK 
DAY.

163
00:06:10,661 --> 00:06:12,413
GET OUT OF THAT OFFICE.

164
00:06:12,413 --> 00:06:13,706
- DON'T COUNT ON IT, DAD.

165
00:06:13,706 --> 00:06:15,332
narrator: 
AND MICHAEL WAS FINALLY READY

166
00:06:15,332 --> 00:06:16,834
TO MAKE HIS SON WATCH HIM DRIVE.

167
00:06:16,834 --> 00:06:18,085
- ALL RIGHT, STAIR CAR BASICS.

168
00:06:18,085 --> 00:06:20,838
IN ORDER TO GET THIS THING 
UP TO A MINIMUM SPEED,

169
00:06:20,838 --> 00:06:24,299
YOU GOTTA JAM ON THE GAS PEDAL 
FOR ABOUT A MINUTE, OKAY?

170
00:06:24,299 --> 00:06:26,343
BUT IN ORDER TO 
SLOW THIS THING DOWN,

171
00:06:26,343 --> 00:06:28,303
YOU GOTTA GET ALMOST IMMEDIATELY 
BACK ON THE BRAKE PEDAL...

172
00:06:28,303 --> 00:06:30,305
'CAUSE YOU GOT ABOUT 
TWO TONS OF STAIRS BEHIND YOU.

173
00:06:30,305 --> 00:06:32,850
WE'RE GONNA COVER THE HYDRAULIC 
FLAPS AND THE RISER SYSTEM...

174
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:35,227
AFTER I TELL YOU THE BASICS 
ABOUT HOW TO AVOID A HOP-ON.

175
00:06:35,227 --> 00:06:36,854
BUT THE FIRST THING 
WE'RE GONNA GO OVER--

176
00:06:36,854 --> 00:06:38,856
OW!

177
00:06:38,856 --> 00:06:41,066
narrator: AND THAT'S WHEN 
MICHAEL DECIDED THAT PERHAPS

178
00:06:41,066 --> 00:06:42,860
IT WAS TIME FOR A SICK DAY.

179
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:46,363
LET'S GO OVER THE ROUTE 
TO THE HOSPITAL. OW!

180
00:06:46,363 --> 00:06:50,367
- MY BABY IS SICK, BUT MOTHER 
IS HERE TO NURSE YOU.

181
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:51,619
- WELL, NOW I'M A LITTLE SICKER.

182
00:06:51,619 --> 00:06:53,996
- WELL, DON'T YOU WORRY 
ABOUT WORK TODAY.

183
00:06:53,996 --> 00:06:57,583
I AM READY AND WILLING 
TO STEP UP AND TAKE OVER.

184
00:06:57,583 --> 00:06:59,126
- YEAH, AND I'LL GET GEORGE 
MICHAEL READY

185
00:06:59,126 --> 00:07:00,127
FOR HIS DRIVING TEST.

186
00:07:00,127 --> 00:07:01,921
- NO, NO, NO, I'M GONNA TEACH 
HIM WHEN I GET OUT.

187
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:04,089
AND NO ONE'S TAKING OVER 
FOR ME AT THE BLUTH COMPANY.

188
00:07:04,089 --> 00:07:05,633
- MICHAEL, THIS IS WHAT WE 
TALKED ABOUT.

189
00:07:05,633 --> 00:07:08,886
I'M SURE THEY'LL DO 
JUST FINE WITHOUT YOU.

190
00:07:08,886 --> 00:07:11,138
- WELL, YOU'RE WRONG, 
BECAUSE WE'RE IN CRISIS THERE.

191
00:07:11,138 --> 00:07:14,099
THEY NEED TO KNOW THAT 
I'M IN CHARGE AND I'M IN CON--

192
00:07:14,099 --> 00:07:16,894
I'M PEEING. 
AM I PEEING?

193
00:07:16,894 --> 00:07:18,145
- I'M SORRY. 
WE GAVE YOU A LITTLE

194
00:07:18,145 --> 00:07:19,439
SOMETHING TO RELAX YOU.

195
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:21,524
IT MAY HAVE TAKEN THE TINGLE OUT 
OF YOUR GENITALS.

196
00:07:21,524 --> 00:07:24,318
- OH, NO. YOU'RE NOT 
TAKING CARE OF MY SON.

197
00:07:24,318 --> 00:07:25,570
- I'M SORRY TO SAY THIS,

198
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:28,739
BUT IT'S TOO LATE FOR ME 
TO DO ANYTHING FOR YOUR SON.

199
00:07:28,739 --> 00:07:30,783
- LET HIM KEEP TALKING.

200
00:07:30,783 --> 00:07:32,034
- BECAUSE DR. STEIN HERE

201
00:07:32,034 --> 00:07:34,244
HAS ALREADY BEEN ASSIGNED 
TO HIS CASE.

202
00:07:34,244 --> 00:07:35,496
YOU'RE LUCKY. 
HE'S THE BEST.

203
00:07:35,496 --> 00:07:37,998
- WELL, ONLY IN THE COUNTY.

204
00:07:37,998 --> 00:07:41,001
BUT I'M CERTAINLY GOOD ENOUGH TO 
TAKE OUT THAT APPENDIX OF YOURS.

205
00:07:41,001 --> 00:07:42,252
- APPENDIX?

206
00:07:42,252 --> 00:07:44,379
- I DON'T BUY IT. 
COULD BE A HERNIA.

207
00:07:44,379 --> 00:07:46,549
- OR IT COULD BE YOUR COLON.

208
00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:48,968
I'D WANT TO GET IN THERE 
AND FIND SOME ANSWERS.

209
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:51,512
- WELL, I AM THE BEST DOCTOR 
IN THE STATE.

210
00:07:51,512 --> 00:07:53,473
BUT IF YOU DON'T 
TRUST MY DECISIONS--

211
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:54,807
- NO, NO, NO. NO. 
YOU'RE THE DOCTOR.

212
00:07:54,807 --> 00:07:56,726
YOU SEE, 
HE'S THE AUTHORITY HERE.

213
00:07:56,726 --> 00:07:58,478
WE NEED TO RESPECT HIM 
JUST LIKE THE EMPLOYEES

214
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:01,481
AT THE BLUTH COMPANY 
NEED TO RESPECT ME.

215
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:03,107
- OKAY, I'M GOING TO 
PUT YOU ON THIS MACHINE

216
00:08:03,107 --> 00:08:04,942
TO SLOW DOWN YOUR HEART RATE.

217
00:08:04,942 --> 00:08:06,193
HOPEFULLY NOT TOO SLOW,

218
00:08:06,193 --> 00:08:10,280
BECAUSE IT'S ALREADY 
DANGEROUSLY SLOW AS IT IS.

219
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:13,450
[chuckles] 
- WHATEVER YOU THINK, DOCTOR.

220
00:08:13,450 --> 00:08:15,160
narrator: MEANWHILE, 
GOB WAS STILL TRYING

221
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:17,538
TO ARRANGE 
HIS COMEBACK IN MAGIC.

222
00:08:17,538 --> 00:08:19,707
- SO I'D BE A MAGICIAN 
AND YOU'D BE MY ASSISTANT?

223
00:08:19,707 --> 00:08:21,751
- WELL, ON PAPER, YES.

224
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:23,002
BUT ONCE THE SHOW STARTS,

225
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:25,505
AND YOU RAM THAT SWORD 
THROUGH MY BELLY,

226
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:27,256
PEOPLE WILL KNOW THAT 
I'M THE ONE WHO BELONGS

227
00:08:27,256 --> 00:08:28,966
BACK IN THE ALLIANCE.

228
00:08:28,966 --> 00:08:31,969
THE KIND OF TRICK THAT I CAN PUT 
ON A DVD, LIKE TONY WONDER DOES.

229
00:08:31,969 --> 00:08:33,763
narrator: TONY WONDER HAD 
STARTLED THE WORLD

230
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:36,974
BY BAKING 
HIMSELF INTO A LOAF OF BREAD.

231
00:08:36,974 --> 00:08:39,184
HE SOLD THE DVD'S OF IT 
ON HIS WEB SITE,

232
00:08:39,184 --> 00:08:41,186
WHICH MANY CLAIMED SUFFERED 
DUE TO ITS POP-UP ADS.

233
00:08:41,186 --> 00:08:43,188
- THANKS.

234
00:08:43,188 --> 00:08:46,692
I'M FINALLY BEING TREATED LIKE A 
REAL PERSON, NOT SOME DEFORMED--

235
00:08:46,692 --> 00:08:49,987
- [screams] HOOK! FORGOT ABOUT 
THAT THING, ELEPHANT MAN.

236
00:08:49,987 --> 00:08:51,572
GONNA HAVE TO FIGURE OUT 
SOMETHING TO DO

237
00:08:51,572 --> 00:08:52,573
SO THAT PEOPLE CAN 
LOOK AT YOU

238
00:08:52,573 --> 00:08:54,784
WITHOUT WANTING 
TO KILL THEMSELVES.

239
00:08:54,784 --> 00:08:57,995
narrator: THAT NIGHT, GEORGE SR. 
HEARD ABOUT MICHAEL'S ILLNESS.

240
00:08:57,995 --> 00:08:59,246
- THE EMPLOYEES ARE GONNA PANIC.

241
00:08:59,246 --> 00:09:00,998
THEY NEED TO KNOW THAT 
SOMEONE'S IN CONTROL.

242
00:09:00,998 --> 00:09:04,168
- AND HOW DO WE DO THAT? 
- BOOYAH!

243
00:09:04,168 --> 00:09:07,129
narrator: 
AND AT THE GOTHIC CASTLE,

244
00:09:07,129 --> 00:09:09,549
BUSTER HAD BEEN OUTFITTED WITH 
A MECHANICAL HALLOWEEN HAND.

245
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:10,966
- WHOA!

246
00:09:10,966 --> 00:09:14,011
LOOKS LIKE YOU'VE 
GOT SOME DIRTY EARS.

247
00:09:14,011 --> 00:09:16,221
- WELL, YOU'RE NOT ON THE BANNED 
LIST, SO YOU CAN GO ON AT 6:00.

248
00:09:16,221 --> 00:09:19,016
- 6:00? LOOKS LIKE 
YOU'LL BE MY OPENER.

249
00:09:19,016 --> 00:09:23,646
- TONY WONDER! 
- [screaming]

250
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:25,105
[screams]

251
00:09:30,778 --> 00:09:33,030
[panting] 
- YOU LIKE BREAD?

252
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:35,741
- YEAH. 
- HAVE SOME.

253
00:09:35,741 --> 00:09:38,744
- WOW, IT'S WARM. 
- HOW DID YOU DO THAT?

254
00:09:38,744 --> 00:09:41,246
- OH, HO, HO. 
MAGICIANS ONLY.

255
00:09:41,246 --> 00:09:43,082
[whispering] I FOLDED IT UP 
INTO SOME SQUARES,

256
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:44,959
AND I PUT IT 
IN A POUCH UNDER MY SHIRT,

257
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,210
AND THEN I PULL IT OUT,

258
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:47,962
AND I MAKE IT LOOK LIKE 
IT CAME OUT OF MY SKIN.

259
00:09:47,962 --> 00:09:50,380
- WOW, THAT SOUNDS EASY. 
- KEEP IT TO YOURSELF.

260
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:51,632
AND GOOD LUCK UP THERE 
TONIGHT.

261
00:09:51,632 --> 00:09:54,051
AND YOU! 
YOU'LL GET THERE SOMEDAY.

262
00:09:54,051 --> 00:09:56,721
I STARTED OUT AS A LITTLE "W." 
SOMEHOW I BECAME A BIG ONE.

263
00:09:56,721 --> 00:09:58,723
I DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW 
IT HAPPENED. ALL RIGHT?

264
00:09:58,723 --> 00:10:01,266
[screaming]

265
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:05,145
MY EYE!

266
00:10:05,145 --> 00:10:07,189
[screams]

267
00:10:07,189 --> 00:10:09,441
[panting]

268
00:10:09,441 --> 00:10:11,652
ENJOY THE HANUKKAH 
COOKIE, MAN.

269
00:10:14,446 --> 00:10:16,448
- WHAT A COOL GUY.

270
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:23,497
narrator: TOBIAS HAD BEEN SENT 
TO THE OFFICE BY GEORGE SR.

271
00:10:23,497 --> 00:10:25,165
- MY NAME IS DR. TOBIAS FUNKE

272
00:10:25,165 --> 00:10:27,167
AND I'LL BE FILLING IN 
FOR MICHAEL, WHO IS NOT SICK.

273
00:10:27,167 --> 00:10:29,169
[chuckles]

274
00:10:29,169 --> 00:10:32,923
IN FACT, JUST TODAY I SAW 
A SLIVER OF HIS BUTTOCKS,

275
00:10:32,923 --> 00:10:34,800
AND THEY'RE AS FRESH AND FIRM 
AS A GEORGIA PEACH,

276
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,176
SO NOT TO WORRY.

277
00:10:36,176 --> 00:10:37,511
BUT BEFORE YOU ALL RISE UP 
AND SAY,

278
00:10:37,511 --> 00:10:40,723
"WELL, LET'S MAKE 
THIS MAN OUR LEADER,"

279
00:10:40,723 --> 00:10:44,601
WELL, I THINK THAT WON'T BE 
NECESSARY AFTER YOU SEE THIS.

280
00:10:44,601 --> 00:10:45,936
IS THIS RIGHT?

281
00:10:45,936 --> 00:10:47,521
narrator: 
MEANWHILE, LINDSAY HAD ALSO

282
00:10:47,521 --> 00:10:49,189
VIOLATED MICHAEL'S AUTHORITY..

283
00:10:49,189 --> 00:10:51,191
AND WAS TEACHING 
GEORGE MICHAEL TO DRIVE.

284
00:10:51,191 --> 00:10:53,193
- ARE YOU SURE YOU DON'T WANT ME 
TO JUST WATCH YOU FOR A WHILE?

285
00:10:53,193 --> 00:10:55,905
- DRIVING IS ABOUT CONFIDENCE, 
GEORGE MICHAEL.

286
00:10:55,905 --> 00:10:59,074
JAM ON IT! 
IT FEELS GREAT, RIGHT?

287
00:10:59,074 --> 00:11:01,493
NOW, PUT YOUR FOOT ON THE BRAKE. 
THERE'S A LIGHT IN A HALF MILE.

288
00:11:01,493 --> 00:11:02,619
[brakes grinding]

289
00:11:02,619 --> 00:11:05,372
narrator: MEANWHILE, BUSTER 
AND GOB HAD BEGUN...

290
00:11:05,372 --> 00:11:09,501
THE SWORD OF DESTINY ILLUSION 
AT THE GOTHIC CASTLE.

291
00:11:11,962 --> 00:11:13,213
[hand whirring]

292
00:11:13,213 --> 00:11:17,342
- AH-AH, AH-AH, AH-AH! 
OOH! WHOO!

293
00:11:17,342 --> 00:11:19,344
- STOP IT, BUSTER.

294
00:11:19,344 --> 00:11:21,221
- AND NOW OUR MAGIC TRICK. 
- ILLUSION.

295
00:11:21,221 --> 00:11:23,348
- SILENCE, SLAVE!

296
00:11:23,348 --> 00:11:27,519
IN THIS MAGIC TRICK, 
I'M GOING TO PUT A SWORD...

297
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:30,898
THROUGH MY ASSISTANT'S TUMMY. 
- NO PATTER.

298
00:11:30,898 --> 00:11:34,193
- MAY I HAVE THE TRICK SWORD, 
PLEASE?

299
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:37,362
- IT'S A REAL SWORD, 
MASTER.

300
00:11:37,362 --> 00:11:41,033
- OH-HO! 
[light applause]

301
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:43,869
[applause increases]

302
00:11:43,869 --> 00:11:45,120
- OOH! HOO, HOO, HOO!

303
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,956
- WE'VE GOT 'EM. I'M GONNA MILK 
THIS FOR A MINUTE.

304
00:11:46,956 --> 00:11:49,666
- OKAY. 
- [panting]

305
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:55,005
- [applause] 
- [whooping]

306
00:11:55,005 --> 00:11:57,758
- [screaming] 
MY HAND! MY HAND!

307
00:11:57,758 --> 00:11:59,718
[motor whirring]

308
00:12:07,935 --> 00:12:10,187
narrator: AND THE AUDIENCE 
WASN'T THE ONLY ONE IMPRESSED

309
00:12:10,187 --> 00:12:11,646
BY THE PERFORMANCE.

310
00:12:11,646 --> 00:12:12,898
- BRAVO.

311
00:12:12,898 --> 00:12:17,820
HEY, GIVE US A SEC, 
WOULD YOU, CANDIDA?

312
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:21,198
MY BROTHER'S WIDOW. 
IT'S-- [bleep] UP.

313
00:12:21,198 --> 00:12:24,701
HEY, SO THE ACCIDENT ANGLE. 
RIGHT ON.

314
00:12:24,701 --> 00:12:25,953
- OH, THANK YOU, 
VERY MUCH.

315
00:12:25,953 --> 00:12:26,954
- NO, THANK YOU.

316
00:12:26,954 --> 00:12:28,873
THE "HOW'D HE DO DATS?" 
ATE IT UP.

317
00:12:28,873 --> 00:12:30,833
SORRY. THAT'S WHAT 
WE CALL THE AUDIENCE.

318
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:32,209
- NO, I-I KNOW-- 
I KNOW ABOUT ALL THAT.

319
00:12:32,209 --> 00:12:34,003
USED TO HAVE A SOLO ACT.

320
00:12:34,003 --> 00:12:35,838
THERE WAS TALK OF BOILING ME 
INTO A BISQUE AT ONE POINT.

321
00:12:35,838 --> 00:12:37,089
- NOT REGISTERING.

322
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:39,591
BUT YOU HITCHED YOUR WAGON 
TO THE RIGHT STAR.

323
00:12:39,591 --> 00:12:40,843
I WANT YOU GUYS ON MY NEXT DVD.

324
00:12:40,843 --> 00:12:43,387
- YOU WANT US FOR 
"USE YOUR ILLUSION?"

325
00:12:43,387 --> 00:12:45,347
- WELL, ACTUALLY, SOME BAND HAS 
GOT THE RIGHTS TO THAT TITLE.

326
00:12:45,347 --> 00:12:47,391
SO, I'M THINKIN', LIKE, 
USE YOUR ILLUSION II.

327
00:12:47,391 --> 00:12:48,934
BUT, YEAH, 
MEET ME OUT THERE TOMORROW.

328
00:12:48,934 --> 00:12:51,854
AND, UH, IF YOU GET THIRSTY--

329
00:12:51,854 --> 00:12:53,480
[screaming]

330
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:05,659
HAVE A FREE ROUND OF DRINKS, 
COURTESY OF TONY WONDER.

331
00:13:05,659 --> 00:13:06,911
- IT'S A SUBWAY SUB 
CLUB CARD.

332
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:09,496
- THAT'S A MAGICIAN.

333
00:13:09,496 --> 00:13:11,248
- OH, IT STILL NEEDS 
THREE STAMPS.

334
00:13:11,248 --> 00:13:14,209
narrator: MICHAEL HAD JUST COME 
AROUND FROM HIS APPENDECTOMY.

335
00:13:14,209 --> 00:13:15,460
- GIVE ME THE PHONE.

336
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:16,545
I WANT TO CALL GEORGE MICHAEL, 
TELL HIM I'M OKAY.

337
00:13:16,545 --> 00:13:19,089
- HE'S ON HIS WAY HERE. 
WE PASSED HIM ON THE ROAD.

338
00:13:19,089 --> 00:13:22,467
HE WAS DOING REALLY WELL. 
HAD HIS FIRST HOP-ON.

339
00:13:22,467 --> 00:13:23,718
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

340
00:13:23,718 --> 00:13:25,137
HE'S DRIVING? I TOLD LINDSAY 
NOT TO TEACH HIM.

341
00:13:25,137 --> 00:13:26,680
I WAS GOING TO 
VIDEOTAPE THAT HOP-ON.

342
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:28,390
- HEY, DAD. 
HOW'RE YOU FEELING?

343
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:29,641
- BAD, GEORGE MICHAEL.

344
00:13:29,641 --> 00:13:31,560
I JUST FOUND OUT LINDSAY'S 
TEACHING YOU HOW TO DRIVE.

345
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,603
- YEAH. SHE'S STILL TRYING TO 
GET THE STAIRS UNWEDGED

346
00:13:33,603 --> 00:13:35,605
FROM THE EMERGENCY ROOM 
OVERHANG.

347
00:13:35,605 --> 00:13:37,441
- I WAS GONNA TEACH YOU. 
YOU KNOW THAT.

348
00:13:37,441 --> 00:13:39,318
JUST FORGET EVERYTHING SHE TOLD 
YOU, AND WE'LL START OVER.

349
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:41,278
- OH, FOR GOD'S SAKE. 
TOBIAS IS RIGHT.

350
00:13:41,278 --> 00:13:42,529
- WHAT?

351
00:13:42,529 --> 00:13:43,780
- YOU HAVE TO CONTROL 
EVERYONE'S LIFE.

352
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:45,032
I DON'T KNOW WHERE YOU 
GET THAT FROM.

353
00:13:45,032 --> 00:13:46,575
OSCAR, 
STOP LICKING THAT SORE.

354
00:13:46,575 --> 00:13:47,826
- I'M NOT.

355
00:13:47,826 --> 00:13:50,579
- WELL, THE OPERATION WENT 
PRETTY SMOOTHLY.

356
00:13:50,579 --> 00:13:53,916
BUT ONCE I GOT IN THERE, 
THE APPENDIX WASN'T SO INFLAMED.

357
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:55,042
D'OH.

358
00:13:55,042 --> 00:13:56,293
- I KNEW IT.

359
00:13:56,293 --> 00:13:58,003
- OKAY. WELL, CAN WE 
GET ME OUT OF HERE?

360
00:13:58,003 --> 00:13:59,379
I GOTTA RETRAIN MY SON 
HOW TO DRIVE,

361
00:13:59,379 --> 00:14:01,340
AND I NEED TO 
STOP BY THE OFFICE...

362
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:03,050
TO MAKE SURE MY BUSINESS 
DOESN'T GO TO HELL.

363
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:04,593
- AND, NOT SO FAST, MICHAEL.

364
00:14:04,593 --> 00:14:07,471
THERE SEEMS TO BE A BACTERIAL 
INFECTION FROM THE OPERATION...

365
00:14:07,471 --> 00:14:10,807
WHICH LEFT AN ABSCESS 
IN YOUR ABDOMINAL WALL.

366
00:14:10,807 --> 00:14:11,934
- EW.

367
00:14:11,934 --> 00:14:14,269
- I KNOW, IT'S PRETTY GROSS. 
BUT IT COULD HEAL ON ITS OWN.

368
00:14:14,269 --> 00:14:19,608
BUT I SAY WE GO IN THERE 
DR. STEIN-STYLE AND CUT IT OUT.

369
00:14:19,608 --> 00:14:20,860
I WANT TO SHOW THESE INTERNS

370
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:23,778
WHAT THE BEST DOCTOR 
IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA CAN DO.

371
00:14:23,778 --> 00:14:27,741
- WELL, I RESPECT YOUR DECISION. 
- I'LL CHECK ON YOU SOON.

372
00:14:27,741 --> 00:14:29,869
- MICHAEL, THIS CRAZY POINT 
YOU'RE TRYING TO MAKE ABOUT

373
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:32,579
RESPECTING AUTHORITY IS ABSURD.

374
00:14:32,579 --> 00:14:33,873
AND ONE DAY, YOU'RE GONNA 
WAKE UP

375
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:37,084
AND FIND OUT IT HAS 
CAUSED YOU NOTHING BUT TROUBLE.

376
00:14:37,084 --> 00:14:38,335
- AND YOU ARE PEEING AGAIN.

377
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:41,546
narrator: AND AS 
THE ANESTHESIA TOOK HOLD,

378
00:14:41,546 --> 00:14:44,591
MICHAEL REALIZED HE WAS GOING TO 
WAKE UP TO NOTHING BUT TROUBLE.

379
00:14:44,591 --> 00:14:46,176
announcer: THE F.B.I. HAS 
PINPOINTED THE LOCATION

380
00:14:46,176 --> 00:14:49,429
OF ESCAPED CONVICT 
GEORGE BLUTH TODAY,

381
00:14:49,429 --> 00:14:53,976
THANKS TO A TAPE TURNED IN BY A 
RABID AND DISGRUNTLED EMPLOYEE.

382
00:14:53,976 --> 00:14:55,769
THE F.B.I. HAS MATCHED THE 
DESIGN OF THE ATTIC

383
00:14:55,769 --> 00:14:59,731
TO ONE OF 
SADDAM HUSSEIN'S IRAQI HOUSES.

384
00:14:59,731 --> 00:15:01,525
AND IT APPEARS 
HIS SON IS WITH HIM.

385
00:15:01,525 --> 00:15:03,527
- THIS IS MY DEMAND.

386
00:15:03,527 --> 00:15:05,070
- BOOYAH!

387
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:12,452
narrator: 
BUSTER AND GOB WERE WAITING

388
00:15:12,452 --> 00:15:14,246
TO MEET WITH TONY WONDER.

389
00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:15,580
- ALL RIGHT. 
HE'S GONNA LOWBALL US,

390
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:18,458
SO JUST LET ME DO 
THE TALKING, ALL RIGHT, BUSTY?

391
00:15:18,458 --> 00:15:21,628
THIS DVD IS THE DESTINY 
THE SWORD HAS CHOSEN FOR ME.

392
00:15:21,628 --> 00:15:24,464
- I WONDER WHERE HE IS.

393
00:15:24,464 --> 00:15:27,927
- DID SOMEBODY SAY, "WONDER"?

394
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:30,679
- HE JUST APPEARED OUT OF 
NOWHERE,

395
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:32,472
IN FRONT OF THAT DUMBWAITER.

396
00:15:32,472 --> 00:15:34,891
narrator: ACTUALLY, HE'D BEEN 
HIDING INSIDE THE DUMBWAITER

397
00:15:34,891 --> 00:15:36,476
FOR OVER 20 MINUTES,

398
00:15:36,476 --> 00:15:38,270
WAITING FOR SOMEONE 
TO USE THE WORD "WONDER."

399
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:40,522
- I WONDER WHERE HE IS.

400
00:15:40,522 --> 00:15:43,150
OH, HEY, YOU'VE GOT A PIECE OF 
LETTUCE ON YOUR SHOULDER.

401
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:45,319
- TA-DA!

402
00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:46,570
PART OF THE TRICK.

403
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:49,573
SO, LET'S GET DOWN 
TO BUSINESS, SHALL WE?

404
00:15:49,573 --> 00:15:52,367
HEY, CAN YOU, UH, GO WAIT WITH 
THE OTHER ASSISTANTS OVER THERE?

405
00:15:52,367 --> 00:15:53,618
- WHAT?

406
00:15:53,618 --> 00:15:55,704
- NO, WHATEVER YOU SAY TO ME, 
YOU CAN SAY TO HIM.

407
00:15:55,704 --> 00:15:59,374
I GRANT HIM MAGIC SANCTUARY.

408
00:15:59,374 --> 00:16:01,335
- UH, YOU GRANT ME? COME ON, 
YOU CAN'T JUST MAKE UP--

409
00:16:01,335 --> 00:16:02,836
- THAT'S FINE.

410
00:16:02,836 --> 00:16:06,506
I SECOND THE SANCTUARY, 
BUT WITH A CLAUSE OF SILENCE.

411
00:16:06,506 --> 00:16:08,258
SO, I WANT YOU GUYS TO BE ON 
USE YOUR ILLUSION.

412
00:16:08,258 --> 00:16:10,427
ONLY NOW 
IT'S "ALLUSION" WITH AN "A."

413
00:16:10,427 --> 00:16:13,180
SO IF YOU GUYS WANT TO PUT AN 
ALLUSION IN THERE SOMEWHERE,

414
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:14,639
LIKE, YOU KNOW, POE OR 
SOMETHING OR--

415
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:16,516
DON'T DO POE, 
'CAUSE I'M DOIN' POE.

416
00:16:16,516 --> 00:16:18,893
- WHAT ABOUT CHAUCER? 
- JUST NOT POE, OKAY?

417
00:16:18,893 --> 00:16:23,523
AND, UH, I DON'T THINK 
WE NEED, UH, YOUR ASSISTANT.

418
00:16:23,523 --> 00:16:26,651
- WHAT? 
- EH! CLAUSE OF SILENCE.

419
00:16:26,651 --> 00:16:32,199
LOOK, MY ASSISTANT 
IS MY PARTNER. I NEED HIM.

420
00:16:32,199 --> 00:16:35,535
- FOR WHAT, BUSTER, HUH? 
YOU'RE THE MAGIC.

421
00:16:35,535 --> 00:16:37,162
CHECK OUT THOSE MOVES 
YOU'RE DOIN', MAN.

422
00:16:37,162 --> 00:16:39,039
THEY'RE IN THEIR OWN ORBIT.

423
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:41,083
LOOK AT TIAGRA, MY GIRL. 
DON'T LOOK AT HER.

424
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:43,127
'CAUSE YOU LOOK AT HER AND 
IT AFFECTS HER IN A WAY THAT

425
00:16:43,127 --> 00:16:44,878
I DON'T FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH. 
OR GO FOR IT.

426
00:16:44,878 --> 00:16:46,505
I DON'T CARE, WHATEVER. 
I'M JUST SAYIN' IT'S YOUR WORLD.

427
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:47,506
- ALL RIGHT, YOU KNOW WHAT?

428
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:49,799
THE TRICK IS ON YOU, 
TONY WONDER.

429
00:16:49,799 --> 00:16:52,636
I'M THE MAGICIAN. 
HE'S THE ASSISTANT.

430
00:16:52,636 --> 00:16:54,138
WE DON'T NEED HIM!

431
00:16:54,138 --> 00:16:57,682
THE REAL SWORD OF DESTINY TRICK 
HASN'T EVEN BEEN PERFORMED YET.

432
00:16:57,682 --> 00:16:59,226
TA-DA!

433
00:16:59,226 --> 00:17:02,062
- WHOA, WHOA, 
WHOA, WHOA. WAIT.

434
00:17:02,062 --> 00:17:04,106
ARE YOU TELLIN' ME THAT 
YOU HAVE A MULTI-STAGE TRICK

435
00:17:04,106 --> 00:17:05,565
WITH HIDDEN IDENTITIES?

436
00:17:05,565 --> 00:17:06,816
- THAT'S RIGHT.

437
00:17:06,816 --> 00:17:10,654
AND I'M GONNA PERFORM 
THE REAL TRICK THIS AFTERNOON.

438
00:17:10,654 --> 00:17:12,114
- I GUESS WE'LL SEE 
WHAT YOU CAN DO THEN.

439
00:17:12,114 --> 00:17:15,034
- I GUESS WE WILL.

440
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:17,911
- [screaming]

441
00:17:19,454 --> 00:17:20,705
OW! DARRYL,

442
00:17:20,705 --> 00:17:24,834
I TOLD YOU TO MOVE THAT-- 
[bleep] CHAIR 10 TIMES!

443
00:17:24,834 --> 00:17:27,546
AND CLEAN THE-- [bleeps] 
DUMBWAITER WHILE YOU'RE AT IT!

444
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:30,590
- OH, I WAS REALLY HOPING 
FOR A GRAHAM CRACKER.

445
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:32,217
- THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN 
A GOOD SPOT FOR A TRICK.

446
00:17:32,217 --> 00:17:33,802
narrator: MICHAEL AWOKE 
FROM HIS SECOND SURGERY.

447
00:17:33,802 --> 00:17:34,803
- MORNING, SLEEPYHEAD.

448
00:17:34,803 --> 00:17:35,929
- DID YOU GET THE ABSCESS?

449
00:17:35,929 --> 00:17:38,014
- WELL, UH, WE HAD 
A LITTLE WHOOPSIE.

450
00:17:38,014 --> 00:17:39,266
SEE, WE GOT THE ABSCESS,

451
00:17:39,266 --> 00:17:42,269
BUT I THINK WE MIGHT HAVE LEFT 
SOME SNIPPERS IN THERE.

452
00:17:42,269 --> 00:17:43,520
IT'S NOT VERY LIKELY,

453
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:47,566
BUT ONE OF THE ASSISTANTS HAVING 
TAKEN THEM IS EVEN LESS LIKELY.

454
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:49,443
UNLESS I LEFT THEM 
IN MY SCRUBS.

455
00:17:49,443 --> 00:17:52,571
- MICHAEL, GOOD NEWS.

456
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:55,699
THEY THINK GEORGE IS IN IRAQ. 
ALL THE PRESSURE'S OFF HIM.

457
00:17:55,699 --> 00:17:59,244
- THAT WAS ON THE NEWS? 
I THOUGHT THAT I DREAMT THAT.

458
00:17:59,244 --> 00:18:00,954
OH, THEY'RE GONNA THINK 
THAT I'M THERE. OW!

459
00:18:00,954 --> 00:18:02,372
- BUT NOT TO WORRY.

460
00:18:02,372 --> 00:18:04,916
TOBIAS SAID HE'S HANDLING IT 
WITH THE F.B.I.,

461
00:18:04,916 --> 00:18:07,461
AND THE EMPLOYEES 
HAVE EVERYTHING UNDER CONTROL.

462
00:18:07,461 --> 00:18:09,421
- NO, THAT'S THE WORST THING 
POSSIBLE.

463
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:11,673
THEY THINK THE COMPANY'S IN 
TROUBLE AND THAT I'M IN IRAQ.

464
00:18:11,673 --> 00:18:13,675
I GOTTA GET DOWN THERE. 
I NEED YOUR CAR KEYS.

465
00:18:13,675 --> 00:18:15,385
narrator: AND SO MICHAEL AND 
GEORGE MICHAEL

466
00:18:15,385 --> 00:18:16,886
HEADED TO THE OFFICE.

467
00:18:16,886 --> 00:18:18,138
- RIGHT HERE, GENTLEMEN.

468
00:18:18,138 --> 00:18:19,598
narrator: WHICH IS HOW 
TOBIAS MISSED HIM.

469
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:24,018
- MICHAEL BLUTH IS NOT... 
IN IRAQ.

470
00:18:24,018 --> 00:18:28,482
MICHAEL, BACK TO BED WITH YOU. 
YOU LOOK AWFUL.

471
00:18:28,482 --> 00:18:30,066
narrator: MICHAEL RUSHED TO 
THE OFFICE

472
00:18:30,066 --> 00:18:36,072
ONLY TO FIND THAT 
HIS WORST FEARS HAD COME TRUE.

473
00:18:36,072 --> 00:18:37,324
- WE'RE TOO LATE. 
IT'S GONE.

474
00:18:37,324 --> 00:18:38,742
EVERYBODY SAID THAT 
I WAS TOO CONTROLLING,

475
00:18:38,742 --> 00:18:39,993
BUT I WALK AWAY FOR ONE MINUTE,

476
00:18:39,993 --> 00:18:42,162
LOOK WHAT HAPPENS 
TO THE COMPANY.

477
00:18:42,162 --> 00:18:44,206
I MEAN, THIS IS WHY 
I DIDN'T WANT-- DAMN IT!

478
00:18:44,206 --> 00:18:46,166
- DAD, YOU SHOULD 
PROBABLY TAKE IT EASY.

479
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:47,417
- I SAID THAT THIS WOULD HAPPEN, 
DIDN'T I?

480
00:18:47,417 --> 00:18:49,544
I SAID RESPECT MY AUTHORITY, 
BUT NO ONE WOULD LISTEN.

481
00:18:49,544 --> 00:18:51,671
EVERYBODY HAD 
THEIR OWN BETTER ID-- OW!

482
00:18:51,671 --> 00:18:53,089
narrator: 
AND MAYBE IT WAS THE STRESS

483
00:18:53,089 --> 00:18:55,842
OR EVEN THE MISPLACED SNIPPERS,

484
00:18:55,842 --> 00:18:58,011
BUT MICHAEL 
HAD NEVER FELT WORSE.

485
00:18:58,011 --> 00:18:59,763
HOWEVER, THANKS TO TAKING ON 
HIS AUTHORITY,

486
00:18:59,763 --> 00:19:02,599
THE EMPLOYEES 
HAD NEVER FELT BETTER.

487
00:19:02,599 --> 00:19:03,850
- TED?

488
00:19:03,850 --> 00:19:05,101
- OH, HEY, MICHAEL. 
GOOD NEWS.

489
00:19:05,101 --> 00:19:06,770
WE LEASED THE TOP FLOOR 
TO ANOTHER COMPANY

490
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:07,771
AND MOVED DOWN HERE.

491
00:19:07,771 --> 00:19:08,813
BUT WE CAN STAY IN BUSINESS

492
00:19:08,813 --> 00:19:10,857
WITHOUT HAVING TO BUILD 
THE EXTRA HOUSES.

493
00:19:10,857 --> 00:19:13,109
WE DID IT. 
WE DID IT!

494
00:19:13,109 --> 00:19:15,445
[cheering, applause]

495
00:19:15,445 --> 00:19:16,696
- YOU'RE GOIN' DOWN, 
RIGHT?

496
00:19:16,696 --> 00:19:19,115
- WHOO!

497
00:19:19,115 --> 00:19:20,700
narrator: AND BACK AT THE GOTHIC 
CASTLE,

498
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:23,119
GOB WAS PERFORMING HIS ILLUSION.

499
00:19:23,119 --> 00:19:24,496
- HEY, AFTER I CUT THE CANDLE IN 
HALF,

500
00:19:24,496 --> 00:19:27,832
SWITCH OUT THE REAL SWORD 
FOR THE FAKE ONE.

501
00:19:27,832 --> 00:19:30,460
WHAT ARE YOU DOIN'? 
I'M GOB BLUTH.

502
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:35,006
I'M THE REAL MAGICIAN. 
THIS MAN IS ONLY THE ASSISTANT.

503
00:19:35,006 --> 00:19:39,678
[audience gasps] 
BUSTER, THE SWORD.

504
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:42,138
HANDLE FIRST. 
HANDLE FIRST. [screams]

505
00:19:42,138 --> 00:19:44,974
- [gasping] 
- OH, MY FINGERS!

506
00:19:44,974 --> 00:19:47,394
HE CUT OFF MY-- 
[bleep] FINGERS!

507
00:19:47,394 --> 00:19:50,146
- [whimpers] OH! 
- NO!

508
00:19:50,146 --> 00:19:52,148
[applause] 
[Gob moaning]

509
00:19:52,148 --> 00:19:54,984
- GUY IS GOOD. DAMN GOOD. 
- BRAVO!

510
00:19:54,984 --> 00:19:57,737
- I'M NOT KIDDING! 
HE CUT OFF MY--[bleep] FINGERS!

511
00:19:57,737 --> 00:20:02,158
- I DIDN'T KNOW WE HAD TAQUITOS. 
- MORE! MORE!

512
00:20:02,158 --> 00:20:04,160
narrator: 
AND MICHAEL CAME TO A DECISION.

513
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:06,288
- YOU KNOW WHAT, 
GEORGE MICHAEL?

514
00:20:06,288 --> 00:20:09,749
I THINK I'M GOING TO GIVE UP 
SOME OF MY AUTHORITY,

515
00:20:09,749 --> 00:20:11,835
STARTING NOW.

516
00:20:11,835 --> 00:20:14,504
YOU DRIVE HOME. 
ALL RIGHT?

517
00:20:14,504 --> 00:20:16,047
narrator: 
UNFORTUNATELY, MICHAEL'S

518
00:20:16,047 --> 00:20:17,382
DECISION TO LET HIS SON 
DRIVE A CAR

519
00:20:17,382 --> 00:20:21,177
WITH A MORE RESPONSIVE 
GAS PEDAL...

520
00:20:21,177 --> 00:20:22,471
- [groans]

521
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:25,307
narrator: WAS NOT A GOOD 
DECISION.

522
00:20:25,307 --> 00:20:27,267
- YOUR LEG'S GONNA BE 
FINE, MICHAEL.

523
00:20:27,267 --> 00:20:29,936
AND I WOULDN'T WORRY ABOUT 
GETTING HIT BY ANY MORE CARS.

524
00:20:29,936 --> 00:20:31,271
I'VE SHORTENED YOUR CALF 
MUSCLES

525
00:20:31,271 --> 00:20:33,690
TO THEORETICALLY 
INCREASE YOUR JUMPING ABILITY.

526
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:37,277
BUT IF IT WORKS, I COULD BE 
THE BEST IN THE WORLD.

527
00:20:37,277 --> 00:20:39,946
- I WANT THE OTHER DOCTOR BACK.

528
00:20:39,946 --> 00:20:42,824
narrator: ON THE NEXT 
ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT.

529
00:20:42,824 --> 00:20:44,075
MICHAEL GETS A NEW ROOMMATE.

530
00:20:44,075 --> 00:20:47,036
- YOUR FINGERS HAVE BEEN 
PERFECTLY REATTACHED.

531
00:20:47,036 --> 00:20:50,957
GO AHEAD, TAKE A LOOK.

532
00:20:50,957 --> 00:20:53,001
- MY MIDDLE FINGER 
AND INDEX FINGER ARE--

533
00:20:53,001 --> 00:20:56,045
- SWITCHED FOR 
THE FIRST TIME EVER.

534
00:20:56,045 --> 00:20:58,798
- NICE JOB, FRANK. 
- AMAZING.

535
00:20:58,798 --> 00:21:01,050
narrator: AND THE F.B.I. 
FINDS FOOTAGE MORE TROUBLESOME

536
00:21:01,050 --> 00:21:02,802
THAN THEY'D ORIGINALLY THOUGHT.

537
00:21:02,802 --> 00:21:05,972
- IT APPEARS THERE WAS SOMETHING 
ELSE ON THE VIDEOTAPE.

538
00:21:05,972 --> 00:21:09,017
WE THINK IT'S A TERRORIST 
TRAINING FILM.

539
00:21:09,017 --> 00:21:10,269
- YOU'RE NOT HALF 
THE MAN HE WAS!

540
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:13,438
[muffled shouting]

541
00:21:13,438 --> 00:21:14,939
- THIS KID'S GOT MOVES.
