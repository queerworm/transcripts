00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:19,561
[narrator]<i> Michael Bluth had finally</i>
<i>made good on his threat to go to Phoenix</i>

2
00:00:19,644 --> 00:00:22,689
<i>and even though the Phoenix he went to</i>
<i>was online,</i>

3
00:00:23,106 --> 00:00:25,984
<i>he still enjoyed</i>
<i>the full law school experience</i>

4
00:00:26,067 --> 00:00:28,445
<i>by living in a dorm room while doing so.</i>

5
00:00:28,737 --> 00:00:30,905
George Michael,
what is my log-on password again?

6
00:00:30,989 --> 00:00:34,325
<i>His son George Michael's</i>
<i>senior year dorm room</i>

7
00:00:34,409 --> 00:00:36,661
<i>at the University of California, Irvine.</i>

8
00:00:37,495 --> 00:00:40,457
What have we always said
is the most important thing?

9
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:42,625
I have tried "family."
It does not work for me.

10
00:00:42,709 --> 00:00:44,169
No, privacy.

11
00:00:45,503 --> 00:00:48,965
No one should have your password but you.
I shouldn't even know it.

12
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:50,592
Yes, you've made that point.

13
00:00:51,217 --> 00:00:52,052
Have I?

14
00:00:53,178 --> 00:00:55,138
My point is, we have no secrets
from each other.

15
00:00:55,221 --> 00:00:58,183
We know everything there is to know
about each other. We're like twins.

16
00:00:58,266 --> 00:00:59,893
I don't see us as twins.

17
00:00:59,976 --> 00:01:02,562
Yeah? You name me one way
in which we're different.

18
00:01:04,355 --> 00:01:08,777
[George Michael] I think you tend to be
better at feeling like you belong places.

19
00:01:09,819 --> 00:01:10,653
[Michael] Do I?

20
00:01:12,864 --> 00:01:17,160
Well, I want you to start feeling
like you belong places.

21
00:01:17,952 --> 00:01:20,455
Look at that guy.
He thinks he's a musician.

22
00:01:20,997 --> 00:01:24,834
You've got to start having a little bit
better sense of humor about yourself.

23
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:27,420
Look at me. People say I don't age.

24
00:01:27,504 --> 00:01:30,090
"Hey, look at that guy.
He's got the hair of a teenager."

25
00:01:30,173 --> 00:01:32,050
And I say, "Take your best shot,"

26
00:01:32,133 --> 00:01:34,177
because I think
that that's a good thing

27
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:35,595
because I'm self-effacing.

28
00:01:36,429 --> 00:01:38,098
I want you to be able to do that.

29
00:01:38,181 --> 00:01:39,557
It's hard to be self-effacing

30
00:01:39,641 --> 00:01:43,186
when you're a perfect specimen
of rugged manlessness.

31
00:01:46,106 --> 00:01:48,733
No, you can't hear this,
but we're gonna work on it.

32
00:01:48,817 --> 00:01:50,193
That's why I'm living in your dorm.

33
00:01:50,276 --> 00:01:51,528
<i>But it wasn't the only reason.</i>

34
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:54,405
<i>Years earlier, after securing funding</i>

35
00:01:54,489 --> 00:01:56,741
<i>to build the housing development</i>
<i>Sudden Valley,</i>

36
00:01:56,825 --> 00:02:00,286
{\an8}<i>the economy suddenly went</i>
<i>into a valley itself.</i>

37
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:02,372
<i>Business dried up immediately</i>

38
00:02:02,831 --> 00:02:04,916
<i>and desperate to cover</i>
<i>his copious building loans...</i>

39
00:02:04,999 --> 00:02:06,417
Just till I get on my feet.

40
00:02:06,501 --> 00:02:08,628
<i>...Michael returned to the woman</i>
<i>he could count on</i>

41
00:02:08,711 --> 00:02:10,213
<i>to put off his downfall...</i>

42
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:12,006
I got you!

43
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:15,635
<i>...even though he was soon put off</i>
<i>which caused her to fall down.</i>

44
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:18,221
That's a hot mess.

45
00:02:18,638 --> 00:02:20,598
<i>But weeks stretched into months</i>

46
00:02:20,682 --> 00:02:23,643
<i>and although there was</i>
<i>the occasional knock on the door,</i>

47
00:02:23,726 --> 00:02:25,854
<i>it was seldom a viable buyer.</i>

48
00:02:26,062 --> 00:02:28,189
<i>And it's hard to say whether it was this</i>

49
00:02:28,273 --> 00:02:29,566
<i>that made him lose hope...</i>

50
00:02:31,442 --> 00:02:32,610
Love each other.

51
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:33,820
Pete!

52
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,989
<i>...or the death of that mailman.</i>

53
00:02:36,281 --> 00:02:37,115
Come on.

54
00:02:37,323 --> 00:02:38,158
Wait here.

55
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:39,534
Hang on, Pete!

56
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:42,203
I got one bar!

57
00:02:42,287 --> 00:02:44,205
<i>But Michael finally gave up.</i>

58
00:02:46,082 --> 00:02:47,375
-Hey.
-Dad!

59
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:50,670
I thought we'd have Thanksgiving here
for your senior year.

60
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:53,131
I don't have a kitchen.

61
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:55,592
These are my clothes.

62
00:02:57,719 --> 00:02:58,720
Pete died.

63
00:03:01,055 --> 00:03:04,184
I thought you were living here
because you had nowhere else to go.

64
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:08,605
Yeah, and because you had this big double
room to yourself because of your name.

65
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:12,650
{\an8}<i>The name George Michael did create</i>
<i>confusion in the campus housing office.</i>

66
00:03:12,734 --> 00:03:14,527
This guy's name
is actually George Michael.

67
00:03:14,611 --> 00:03:16,988
No, it's two different guys.
They're twins, ugly.

68
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:19,782
We should sign them up for Twin Club.

69
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:22,285
And let's give them
the big handicap room.

70
00:03:22,952 --> 00:03:24,329
Yeah, that's the other thing.

71
00:03:24,412 --> 00:03:26,122
I kind of wanted to use this time

72
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:29,042
to almost kind of wean off
of the name George Michael.

73
00:03:31,169 --> 00:03:32,003
What?

74
00:03:32,503 --> 00:03:34,547
I don't know,
you know, you get older,

75
00:03:34,797 --> 00:03:36,966
you do a something search
of your own name.

76
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:39,636
<i>And in George Michael's case,</i>
<i>you find this.</i>

77
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:43,014
{\an8}It was in this men's room in,
get this, Beverly Hills,

78
00:03:43,097 --> 00:03:45,308
{\an8}that singer George Michael was arrested

79
00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:48,144
{\an8}for soliciting sex
from an undercover cop.

80
00:03:48,394 --> 00:03:51,147
It was your mother's idea
to call you George Michael.

81
00:03:51,773 --> 00:03:53,900
I think it was just
so that we didn't confuse you

82
00:03:53,983 --> 00:03:56,361
with your uncle George
or your grandfather George.

83
00:03:56,653 --> 00:03:58,947
-Right.
-I got it. Let's call you Boy George.

84
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:01,074
{\an8}Singer Boy George
in the news again today,

85
00:04:01,157 --> 00:04:04,077
{\an8}this time for sexual assault
in a men's public bathroom.

86
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:07,121
{\an8}Beatrix Hebberly-Sneed,
Wee BBC Two.

87
00:04:07,205 --> 00:04:09,499
I think I'll just stick
with George Michael.

88
00:04:09,582 --> 00:04:10,500
Great choice.

89
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:12,210
At least it was consensual.

90
00:04:13,002 --> 00:04:14,921
<i>Now the story of what happened</i>

91
00:04:15,004 --> 00:04:18,341
{\an8}<i>when the one man</i>
<i>who was holding his family together</i>

92
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,134
<i>finally let go</i>

93
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:24,055
{\an8}<i>and the separate journeys</i>
<i>that eventually gave them no choice</i>

94
00:04:24,138 --> 00:04:25,265
<i>but to come back together.</i>

95
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:29,435
{\an8}<i>It's </i>Arrested Development:
Fateful Consequences.

96
00:04:35,358 --> 00:04:37,860
<i>Michael was living in his son's dorm</i>

97
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:39,904
{\an8}<i>to help him become more self-effacing.</i>

98
00:04:39,988 --> 00:04:41,906
{\an8}I guess the bigger point I'm making

99
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:44,325
{\an8}is just that it's hard
to have any privacy,

100
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:46,577
{\an8}now that they've stuck me
with an actual roommate.

101
00:04:46,661 --> 00:04:49,664
{\an8}Well, listen, I'm all for kicking
P-Hound out. You know that.

102
00:04:49,747 --> 00:04:52,375
{\an8}You know,
I didn't really mean privacy from him.

103
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:53,710
I know.

104
00:04:57,588 --> 00:04:58,673
{\an8}You want your space from me?

105
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:03,511
{\an8}Look, listen, hey, look, listen.

106
00:05:04,637 --> 00:05:06,764
{\an8}Listen, look it. Are you listening?

107
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:10,560
{\an8}You want your space. I get it.

108
00:05:10,893 --> 00:05:13,896
{\an8}I did not mean to crowd you, pal.

109
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:16,899
{\an8}Listen, I thought that this was fun,

110
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:19,652
and it is okay if you didn't see it
that way.

111
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:21,863
{\an8}Buddy, it's not like I don't have
someplace to go.

112
00:05:21,946 --> 00:05:23,197
{\an8}I'll go back to the model home.

113
00:05:23,406 --> 00:05:27,035
{\an8}They don't have Internet there,
so I'll just put the law school on pause.

114
00:05:27,118 --> 00:05:28,786
{\an8}It's not the first time I've done that.

115
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:30,705
{\an8}Last time I did that, you were born.

116
00:05:30,788 --> 00:05:33,958
{\an8}Screw it. Maybe I'll just go
to the real Phoenix and finish school.

117
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:36,961
{\an8}They got one in Costa Mesa.
Plus they want me for an article.

118
00:05:37,045 --> 00:05:39,422
{\an8}Media wants to talk to Daddy
about the real-estate business.

119
00:05:39,505 --> 00:05:41,799
{\an8}Once they do that,
I'm gonna be right back on top.

120
00:05:41,883 --> 00:05:43,509
{\an8}This is your school rally shirt.

121
00:05:43,593 --> 00:05:45,428
{\an8}Same size, medium.
Do you know where mine is?

122
00:05:45,511 --> 00:05:47,138
{\an8}We wear the same size, like twin...

123
00:05:47,221 --> 00:05:49,432
{\an8}We're just like twins,
couple of identical--

124
00:05:49,515 --> 00:05:50,767
{\an8}Dad, no, I...

125
00:05:51,142 --> 00:05:55,730
{\an8}Look, I was not talking about privacy
from you per se.

126
00:05:56,064 --> 00:05:59,192
{\an8}I was talking about... my software.

127
00:06:00,276 --> 00:06:01,194
What's that?

128
00:06:01,277 --> 00:06:05,406
It's privacy software.
That's why the word came up.

129
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:06,949
<i>It's not why the word came up,</i>

130
00:06:07,533 --> 00:06:09,744
<i>but George Michael was writing code</i>

131

{\an8}<i>for a block software</i>
<i>with his roommate</i>

132
00:06:12,163 --> 00:06:13,956
{\an8}<i>that was proving challenging,</i>

133
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:16,751
<i>both because of online threats</i>
<i>to his privacy</i>

134
00:06:17,251 --> 00:06:20,380
<i>and some in-room threats</i>
<i>to his privacy as well.</i>

135
00:06:20,463 --> 00:06:21,506
Buddy, is that schoolwork?

136
00:06:21,589 --> 00:06:22,924
We're just in the middle of--

137
00:06:23,007 --> 00:06:25,093
Good. Give me the lappy.
I'll hit "save" for you.

138
00:06:25,176 --> 00:06:26,928
I got to Skype with my adviser in Phoenix.

139
00:06:27,011 --> 00:06:28,221

140
00:06:28,596 --> 00:06:32,225
<i>he's gonna have to Skype me</i>
<i>from a TGI Fridays.</i>

141
00:06:33,768 --> 00:06:34,644
Yeah.

142
00:06:36,354 --> 00:06:39,148
'Cause that hurt for a second.
I was like, "He wants me to go."

143
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:41,150
-God, no.
 -But no. Yeah? No.

144
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:42,318
-No.
-Software.

145
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:47,031
No, I mean, yeah, I may need some privacy
to work on it and that might mean...

146
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:49,409
...you going.

147
00:06:54,288 --> 00:06:56,999
You mean here. Yeah, clearing out.

148
00:06:57,083 --> 00:07:00,044
An hour here, there. Yes?
Got it. Not a problem.

149
00:07:00,128 --> 00:07:02,672
You give me a little fair warning,
I clear right out of here.

150
00:07:02,755 --> 00:07:03,840
Let's schedule it now.

151
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:07,969
I need help with the calendar, though.
It's, like, stuck on 2003.

152
00:07:08,052 --> 00:07:09,929
-Help me break into--
-You just hit "Today."

153
00:07:10,012 --> 00:07:11,681
-The "Today" button.
-It's stuck in 2003,

154
00:07:11,764 --> 00:07:13,933
so I don't have "Today."
I need to jump forward.

<i>George Michael was trying to get used</i>

00:07:43,045 --> 00:07:47,175
Hello! Oh, Mrs. Bluth is here,
for stealing the Queen Mary.

167
00:07:47,258 --> 00:07:50,720
<i>...as it made her eligible for one</i>
<i>of the so-called country club prisons</i>

168
00:07:50,803 --> 00:07:53,514
<i>that had become popular</i>
<i>after the Enron debacle.</i>

169
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:55,099
You want to go here,

170
00:07:55,183 --> 00:07:58,352
so you're gonna take this hallway
to the elevators, then you want to--

171
00:07:58,436 --> 00:08:01,355
Slow down. You sound like the end
of a Cymbalta commercial.

172
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:03,232
Even the lifers get confused.

173
00:08:03,357 --> 00:08:06,402
<i>But even though it was a nice prison,</i>
<i>it was still prison.</i>

174
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:09,238
...choice of fresh scent, sport,
or floral for your delousing.

175
00:08:09,572 --> 00:08:11,949
Also, if you're sexually assaulted
by a guard,

176
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:13,326
press "seven" on your phone.

177
00:08:13,409 --> 00:08:15,495
If you go through the front desk,
it'll take forever.

178
00:08:15,578 --> 00:08:19,290
<i>But in her absence, Buster couldn't bear</i>
<i>the thought of living alone.</i>

179
00:08:19,373 --> 00:08:22,335
My mother's gone away and I thought
you've always been like a...

180
00:08:22,418 --> 00:08:24,420
-Girlfriend.
-Not what I was gonna say!

181
00:08:25,129 --> 00:08:27,215
Anyways, I was over there
and my friend's over here

182
00:08:27,298 --> 00:08:29,133
and I thought,
"Maybe I should just move in,"

183
00:08:29,383 --> 00:08:31,677
because I love to hear
all about your medications

184
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:33,262
and ailments and whatnot.

185
00:08:34,138 --> 00:08:37,183
Is that baby toe of yours still crawling
over the others like a weird weed?

186
00:08:37,266 --> 00:08:39,477
Buster, how sweet of you to remember.

187
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:40,811
It's one of my night terrors.

188
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:44,899
But listen, Buster,
before I invite you into my arms,

189
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:48,194
my bedroom,
my bathtub with the railing,

190
00:08:48,986 --> 00:08:50,863
I have to ask you something.

191
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:54,283
Are you ready to let go of your mother?

192
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:58,829
<i>Buster thought he was,</i>
<i>although there was one ominous sign.</i>

193
00:08:58,955 --> 00:09:00,665
I am ready for that, Lucille.

194
00:09:03,793 --> 00:09:04,877
<i>Did you hear it?</i>

195
00:09:07,463 --> 00:09:10,591
Wait. Did you just drop the "Two"
after my name?

196
00:09:11,676 --> 00:09:12,927
I hope not.

197
00:09:13,344 --> 00:09:15,179
That would be creepy.

198
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:17,306
<i>It was.</i>

199
00:09:21,143 --> 00:09:25,064
<i>Buster wasn't the only Bluth who was ready</i>
<i>to make a real commitment.</i>

200
00:09:25,147 --> 00:09:29,318
<i>Runaway groom Gob Bluth was ready, too,</i>
<i>beginning with an amends...</i>

201
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:30,319
You humiliated me.

202
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:32,947
You made a mockery of my religion
and you ruined our wedding.

203
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:34,574
<i>...by performing an escape act</i>

204
00:09:34,657 --> 00:09:37,910
<i>that resulted in him trapped</i>
<i>in a storage unit for weeks</i>

205
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:40,454
<i>where he had something of an epiphany.</i>

206
00:09:40,538 --> 00:09:43,165
[folksy man] If you don't open up
and let someone else in,

207
00:09:43,374 --> 00:09:46,127
the treasures you have inside
will never come out

208
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:47,545
and you'll never be happy.

209
00:09:48,045 --> 00:09:49,755
We have money to start our life together.

210
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:53,384
Now we have our nest egg... Ann.

211
00:09:54,468 --> 00:09:56,554
Now we have our nest, Ann.

212
00:09:57,930 --> 00:09:59,223
I'm ready to settle.

213
00:10:02,143 --> 00:10:03,060
Marry me.

214
00:10:05,062 --> 00:10:07,857
I'm leaving you, Gob
I don't love you anymore.

215
00:10:08,524 --> 00:10:11,277
I feel sorry for you
and you're gonna be alone forever

216
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,613
unless you let the Holy Ghost inside you.

217
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:15,615
The Holy...

219
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:27,251

222
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:35,926

223
00:10:36,594 --> 00:10:37,470
Steve!

224
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:38,763
It's me.

225
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:43,017
I wanted to let you know
that I'm ready to...

226
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:47,688
...let the son of Gob enfold me.

227
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:51,108
Obviously it's me, your fa--

Gettable, right?

232
00:11:02,411 --> 00:11:05,581
Tell me about the software thing. This is
the Faceblock thing you were working on?

233
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:06,666
Is it like Facebook?

234
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:10,127
No, it's kind of the opposite
of Facebook, you know.

235
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:14,048
Facebook connects you with everyone
and this blocks you from everyone.

236
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:16,509
Kind of like <i>The Anti-Social Network,</i>
right?

237
00:11:16,592 --> 00:11:18,177
-That's very good.
-You can use it.

238
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:19,762
I don't understand the Internet stuff.

239
00:11:19,845 --> 00:11:22,473
You give me all the parts and you tell me
to build a television set,

240
00:11:22,556 --> 00:11:26,519
I can bang that out, but I can't get
the right day to display on my calendar.

241
00:11:26,602 --> 00:11:27,603
Just press "Today."

242
00:11:27,728 --> 00:11:29,730
I just tried that.
Doesn't work on mine.

243
00:11:29,814 --> 00:11:32,775
<i>But Michael had big plans</i>
<i>to salvage his own career.</i>

244
00:11:32,858 --> 00:11:35,695
...because once they come out
with that article on me

245
00:11:35,778 --> 00:11:39,365
in that in-flight magazine,
the family's gonna be right back on top.

246
00:11:39,448 --> 00:11:41,075
The guy's doing a whole spread on me.

247
00:11:41,158 --> 00:11:42,785
-In-flight magazine?
-Yeah.

248
00:11:42,868 --> 00:11:44,787
It's called<i> Altitude.</i>
It's for OutWest Airlines.

249
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:47,248
Next to<i> SkyMall,</i>
the number two most read in all of coach.

250
00:11:47,331 --> 00:11:48,916
Well, three with the safety card,

251
00:11:48,999 --> 00:11:51,085
but get a lot of attention
for Sudden Valley.

252
00:11:51,502 --> 00:11:55,256
And then with your Internet company,
we're gonna have two businesses.

253
00:11:55,631 --> 00:11:57,591
You know?
And yours sounds like such a natural.

254
00:11:57,675 --> 00:11:59,260
No one likes to share their identity.

255
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:01,679
-Right.
-Give me your meal plan card.

256
00:12:01,762 --> 00:12:03,472
I'm gonna run in there, grab a tray,

257
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:05,599
you run around back,
make sure you get there in time

258
00:12:05,683 --> 00:12:08,477
before my hand stamp dries, okay?
Here we go.

259
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:14,108

No.

265
00:12:32,501 --> 00:12:34,670
-She doesn't want to see you.
-Excellent.

266
00:12:35,546 --> 00:12:38,382
<i>She wouldn't forgive him</i>

267

Alex Trebek?

Buster.

274
00:13:02,156 --> 00:13:03,115
No, Buster.

275
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:05,159
<i>But the answer was always no.</i>

276
00:13:05,993 --> 00:13:10,164
Do you have a pie
or a small sponge cake available?

283

We need to rework
our whole system here.

284
00:13:31,018 --> 00:13:33,103
Sounds like you're working

-Hey. How'd you find me?
-Trang's grandfather.

Pal, good news.

288
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:43,739
The article they did on me
in <i>Altitude</i> magazine comes out today.

289
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:44,657
Can I see it?

290
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:47,743
Probably doesn't have it. Try finding
a flight at this time of the year.

291
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:51,247
Ever even been on a plane,
you piece of [bleep]?

292
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:54,875
So can I see it?

293
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:58,045
It is not in the terrestrial news stands
just yet.

294
00:13:58,128 --> 00:14:00,464
Guess what, though?
You, my friend, are in the article.

295
00:14:00,548 --> 00:14:01,966
-I'm in it?
-You're in it.

296
00:14:02,049 --> 00:14:03,759
I mentioned that I'm living in your dorm.

297
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:06,095
I thought it might help
with your popularity problem.

298
00:14:06,637 --> 00:14:10,140
Well, I'm gonna get going
while the room is empty.

299
00:14:10,224 --> 00:14:11,600
Great. See you later.

300
00:14:12,601 --> 00:14:14,103
Boy, that's got to drive you crazy.

301
00:14:14,186 --> 00:14:16,480
The reason you came to the computer lab
was for privacy.

302
00:14:16,564 --> 00:14:18,399
No wonder you can't get a real girl
up there.

303
00:14:18,482 --> 00:14:21,902
<i>Michael was referring to something</i>
<i>he'd walked in on a few days earlier.</i>

304
00:14:21,986 --> 00:14:22,862
P-Hound!

305
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,280
There's a girl in there.

306
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:25,948
There is?

307
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:28,784
Where the hell is George Michael?

308
00:14:29,159 --> 00:14:30,452
-Excuse me. Hello.
-Dad!

309
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:32,788
-Hi.
-Yeah, there's nobody in here.

310
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:36,333
Buddy, bad news.
P-Hound is yanking our chain again.

311
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:37,960
-Uncle Michael.
-Oh, my God.

312
00:14:38,419 --> 00:14:39,712
-Hi.
-Hello there.

313
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:43,841
There is a kind of girl here.
Didn't say it was your cousin.

314
00:14:43,924 --> 00:14:45,092
-Hey.
-He doesn't know.

315
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:48,012
Now, that's smart.
Let him think there's a girl in here.

316
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:51,140
Actually, we've been talking
about how crowded that room is

317
00:14:51,223 --> 00:14:54,727
and P-Hound was suggesting
that maybe we do a vote

318
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:56,645
to see who stays in the dorm room.

319
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:58,314
He suggested that? Are you serious?

320
00:14:58,397 --> 00:15:01,233
The thing is that the room
is only sanctioned for two.

321
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:03,777
Right, and we have a vote.
He's gone in two seconds.

322
00:15:05,696 --> 00:15:06,947
Two against one, right?

323
00:15:07,031 --> 00:15:08,824
-Well, actually--
-We got to do it.

324
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:11,493
The thing is that it kind of puts me
in an awkward position.

325
00:15:11,785 --> 00:15:12,870
-Hi.
-Hey.

326
00:15:12,953 --> 00:15:14,955
Since there's only three people voting,

327
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:17,458
everyone's gonna know
who voted against who.

328
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:19,627
What about if your "girlfriend" wants
to move in?

329
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:21,086
That way, she gets a vote.

330
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:23,088
I'm just here for tutoring.

331
00:15:23,172 --> 00:15:24,632
Not my girlfriend. She's my cousin.

332
00:15:24,715 --> 00:15:27,301
-I'm not attracted to him.
-Why's that even an issue?

333
00:15:27,384 --> 00:15:28,969
P-Hound doesn't know any of that stuff.

334
00:15:29,386 --> 00:15:32,473
Okay? He'll just think that her vote's
the vote that got him out.

335
00:15:32,556 --> 00:15:35,309
Wouldn't my girlfriend want
to get rid of my father?

336
00:15:35,392 --> 00:15:38,020
-I'm not your girlfriend.
-But he doesn't know that.

337
00:15:38,854 --> 00:15:41,398
Someone's got to vote for me,
otherwise, it's suspicious.

338
00:15:41,482 --> 00:15:43,984
We don't want a palace coup, right?

339
00:15:44,068 --> 00:15:45,027
Well, I'll vote you out.

340
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:46,946
-Yeah, I will.
 -I wouldn't make you do that.

341
00:15:47,029 --> 00:15:50,240
Then I fall down the stairs and you feel
 bad about yourself your whole life.

342
00:15:50,699 --> 00:15:52,284
<i>And perhaps it was the chair</i>

343
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:55,579
<i>that fooled Michael into thinking</i>
<i>his next idea was a good one.</i>

344
00:15:56,914 --> 00:15:58,248
What if I vote myself out?

345
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:00,125
You'd do that?

346
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:01,210
How would that help?

347
00:16:01,502 --> 00:16:02,544
It's simple algebra.

348
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:05,714
You two vote against P-Hound,
nobody knows who did what

349
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:07,883
because there's a vote against me in there

350
00:16:08,258 --> 00:16:11,095
and it's, <i>"Adiós,</i> brothiero."
It cannot fail.

351
00:16:11,178 --> 00:16:13,597
<i>Michael was pleased with his plan.</i>

352
00:16:15,099 --> 00:16:16,100
Won't that make it a tie?

353
00:16:16,183 --> 00:16:17,017
<i>Briefly.</i>

354
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:19,728
I mean,
if the two of us vote against P-Hound

355
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:21,689
and you and P-Hound
vote against you,

356
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:23,732
then it's two against two, right?

357
00:16:25,192 --> 00:16:27,945
Wow, you think that he'd vote against me?
I mean...

358
00:16:30,114 --> 00:16:31,031
All right, new plan.

359
00:16:31,573 --> 00:16:34,702
<i>The details of the plan continued</i>
<i>to develop through lunch.</i>

360
00:16:34,785 --> 00:16:36,036
So we got two scenarios.

361
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:38,205
It's either two votes against P-Hound,

362
00:16:38,288 --> 00:16:41,458
one vote against Maeby, one against me,
with that vote being my own,

363
00:16:41,542 --> 00:16:45,045
or if it's two votes against me,
then clearly P-Hound is being nasty.

364
00:16:45,129 --> 00:16:47,131
That triggers a recount,
then it's a P-Hound blitz.

365
00:16:47,214 --> 00:16:48,924
We all vote against P-Hound, he's gone.

366
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:52,386
-What if whoever loses...
-Yeah?

367
00:16:52,803 --> 00:16:54,555
...refuses to go?

368
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:56,432
You think P-Hound would do that?

369
00:16:57,683 --> 00:16:58,517
Okay, new plan.

370
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,352
<i>And so the planning continued</i>

371
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:02,563
<i>through what should have been</i>
<i>Organic Chemistry.</i>

372
00:17:02,646 --> 00:17:05,858
We all pack ahead of time,
really pack a bag,

373
00:17:05,941 --> 00:17:07,276
so it doesn't look rigged.

374
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:10,696
And then the loser, straight out the door.
I mean, that's the deal.

375
00:17:10,779 --> 00:17:13,282
That's the cost of having a vote,
that's the price of freedom.

376
00:17:13,365 --> 00:17:17,161
Maybe it's better if we're all just direct
with each other, you know?

377
00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:18,829
Just say what's on our minds.

378
00:17:18,912 --> 00:17:20,497
Yeah, I think it's gonna come out anyway.

379
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:24,877
Dad, you know,
I've really loved living with you--

380
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:25,919
No talking.

381
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:31,592
No talking once the votes come in. You're
out the door. That's the missing piece.

382
00:17:32,468 --> 00:17:35,012
That's it. This plan is foolproof.

383
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:37,765
I've cherished this, too, pal.

384
00:17:37,848 --> 00:17:41,226
Yeah. I mean, how many fathers get to go
to college with their kid?

385
00:17:47,649 --> 00:17:51,361
<i>While Buster's days were spent trying</i>
<i>to get his mother to love him,</i>

386
00:17:52,154 --> 00:17:55,532
<i>his nights were consumed</i>
<i>with getting his lover to mother him.</i>

387
00:17:55,616 --> 00:18:00,245
Just in time. I hope you are in the mood
for a hot tomato.

388
00:18:01,205 --> 00:18:04,249
Soup? With little grilled
cheese sandwiches on the side?

389
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:06,335
Buster, that was innuendo.

390
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:09,630
My Lord, it's like we're speaking
different languages here.

391
00:18:09,713 --> 00:18:12,216
No, it's not. It is working.

392
00:18:12,674 --> 00:18:14,384
I'm getting hungry.

393
00:18:15,636 --> 00:18:16,637
For love?

394
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:20,933
No. Is this another one of those nights
where nothing is as it seems

395
00:18:21,016 --> 00:18:23,185
and there's no cream pie for dessert?

396
00:18:23,268 --> 00:18:27,898
Holy Toledo, Buster, sometimes I think
I'm nothing but a Horn &amp; Hardart to you.

397
00:18:28,607 --> 00:18:31,485
What happened to innuendo?
Let's do it quick.

398
00:18:31,568 --> 00:18:33,654
It's an old restaurant.

399
00:18:34,655 --> 00:18:38,117
A restaurant? I don't care if it's old.
Look who I'm dating!

400
00:18:38,826 --> 00:18:39,952
Let's go there now.

401
00:18:40,035 --> 00:18:43,539
Buster, you can either be a son
or a lover.

402
00:18:44,248 --> 00:18:46,625
And right now,
you're no good to me as a lover.

403
00:18:47,876 --> 00:18:48,836
Maybe you're right.

404
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:52,464
Maybe this has been wrong from the start.

405
00:18:52,881 --> 00:18:54,633
So, Mom...

406
00:18:55,092 --> 00:18:55,926
Out!

407
00:18:56,009 --> 00:18:58,679
<i>Buster was being kicked out</i>
<i>which was the same fate</i>

408
00:18:58,762 --> 00:19:02,933
<i>that Michael had in mind</i>
<i>for his son's other roommate, P-Hound.</i>

409
00:19:03,225 --> 00:19:05,727
<i>And he prepared to put his scheme to work.</i>

410
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:07,855
<i>He read his own vote first.</i>

411
00:19:08,522 --> 00:19:09,773
First vote to remove...

412
00:19:10,566 --> 00:19:11,400
Michael.

413
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:13,235
What are you gonna do?

414
00:19:15,445 --> 00:19:16,697
Second vote to remove...

415
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:21,243
Michael.

416
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:25,330
<i>Michael expected this,</i>
<i>but didn't expect the sting.</i>

417
00:19:27,457 --> 00:19:30,002
Obviously, if there's a tie,
there's an immediate runoff.

418
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:32,588
Third vote to remove...

419
00:19:35,716 --> 00:19:36,550
Michael.

420
00:19:44,391 --> 00:19:46,101
Did you mean to write "George Michael"?

421
00:19:47,144 --> 00:19:49,062
<i>Obviously, the verdict was in.</i>

422
00:19:49,479 --> 00:19:53,400
<i>And it's hard to know exactly</i>
<i>why Michael opened the fourth ballot.</i>

423
00:19:53,692 --> 00:19:56,445
<i>Was it out of hope or confusion?</i>

424
00:19:57,112 --> 00:20:00,157
<i>Either way, it couldn't be</i>
<i>what he wanted to read.</i>

425
00:20:21,303 --> 00:20:25,224
<i>Michael did the only thing</i>
<i>he could think of that would save face.</i>

426
00:20:43,408 --> 00:20:47,496
<i>On the next </i>Arrested Development:
Fateful Consequences...

427
00:20:48,664 --> 00:20:51,792
[man] <i>If tomorrow, you don't open up</i>
<i>and let someone else in,</i>

428
00:20:52,793 --> 00:20:54,836
<i>then the treasures you have inside</i>

429
00:20:55,796 --> 00:20:56,713
<i>may never come out.</i>

430
00:20:56,797 --> 00:20:58,924
This is my Motherboy Four medal.

431
00:20:59,341 --> 00:21:02,386
[narrator] <i>With nowhere to live,</i>
<i>Buster tries to raise some money...</i>

432
00:21:02,469 --> 00:21:03,303
What'll you give me?

433
00:21:03,512 --> 00:21:07,599
<i>...only to discover he's not</i>
<i>the first Motherboy to hit hard times.</i>

434
00:21:09,851 --> 00:21:11,478
What will you give me for these?

435
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:13,063
All-time low.

436
00:21:15,565 --> 00:21:17,526
<i>And he gets a bit of inspiration.</i>

437
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:20,237
She certainly seems proud of her son.

438
00:21:21,321 --> 00:21:25,075
<i>So Buster returns to the only other mother</i>
<i>he had ever known.</i>

439
00:21:25,158 --> 00:21:27,411
I'm back!
