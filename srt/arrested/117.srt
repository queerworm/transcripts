00:00:01,501 --> 00:00:02,502
narrator: NOW THE STORY

2
00:00:02,502 --> 00:00:04,795
OF A WEALTHY FAMILY 
WHO LOST EVERYTHING

3
00:00:04,795 --> 00:00:06,672
AND THE ONE SON 
WHO HAD NO CHOICE

4
00:00:06,672 --> 00:00:08,049
BUT TO KEEP THEM ALL TOGETHER.

5
00:00:13,763 --> 00:00:16,557
IT'S "ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT."

6
00:00:19,185 --> 00:00:22,480
AGAINST HIS BETTER JUDGMENT, 
MICHAEL HAD RECENTLY SET OUT

7
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:26,192
TO HAVE AN UNCOMPLICATED 
ONE-NIGHT STAND WITH THIS WOMAN.

8
00:00:26,192 --> 00:00:29,695
AND AT HIS BROTHER'S SUGGESTION, 
HE GAVE A FALSE IDENTITY.

9
00:00:29,695 --> 00:00:31,697
- CHARETH CUTESTORY.

10
00:00:31,697 --> 00:00:33,574
narrator: AND WHAT STARTED 
AS A NIGHT OF PASSION

11
00:00:33,574 --> 00:00:34,784
WITH NO STRINGS ATTACHED,

12
00:00:34,784 --> 00:00:36,119
GOT COMPLICATED 
THE NEXT MORNING

13
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:39,247
WHEN MICHAEL FOUND OUT 
SHE WAS BLIND.

14
00:00:39,247 --> 00:00:42,625
HE DECIDED TO KEEP SEEING HER 
SO AS NOT TO APPEAR SUPERFICIAL.

15
00:00:42,625 --> 00:00:44,627
- IF IT'S A ONE-NIGHT STAND, 
I'M NOT VERY GOOD AT IT.

16
00:00:44,627 --> 00:00:45,961
- [chuckles] WOW.

17
00:00:45,961 --> 00:00:48,131
BUT AREN'T YOU BUSY WITH 
THE TRIAL AND EVERYTHING?

18
00:00:48,131 --> 00:00:49,382
narrator: UNFORTUNATELY,

19
00:00:49,382 --> 00:00:53,678
THE WOMAN ALSO TURNED OUT TO BE 
HIS FATHER'S PROSECUTOR.

20
00:00:53,678 --> 00:00:56,972
AND SO MICHAEL WENT TO 
MAGGIE'S TO REVEAL HIS IDENTITY.

21
00:00:56,972 --> 00:00:58,224
BUT BEFORE HE COULD--

22
00:00:58,224 --> 00:00:59,975
- IT'S AN OVERVIEW 
OF THE GOVERNMENT'S CASE

23
00:00:59,975 --> 00:01:02,062
AGAINST THE BLUTH FAMILY.

24
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:03,313
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

25
00:01:03,313 --> 00:01:06,274
DO WE HAVE A CASE?

26
00:01:06,274 --> 00:01:07,608
[mouthing words]

27
00:01:10,445 --> 00:01:12,988
narrator: MEANWHILE, 
MICHAEL'S SON, GEORGE MICHAEL,

28
00:01:12,988 --> 00:01:14,699
DISCOVERED THAT HIS COUSIN 
MAEBY

29
00:01:14,699 --> 00:01:17,410
HAD BEEN LIVING 
A DOUBLE LIFE.

30
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:18,661
- [coughing]

31
00:01:18,661 --> 00:01:21,164
- MAEBY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

32
00:01:21,164 --> 00:01:23,040
YOU KNOW, I STILL DON'T GET WHY 
YOU'RE PRETENDING

33
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,084
TO BE TWO PEOPLE, 
AND WHY IS ONE OF YOU SICK?

34
00:01:25,084 --> 00:01:27,128
- HEY, YOU DON'T GET GIANT 
CHECKS IF YOU'RE HEALTHY.

35
00:01:27,128 --> 00:01:30,590
- PLEASE WELCOME SURELY FUNKE.

36
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:32,842
- PLUS, WHO'S GOING TO 
GET MAD AT THE DYING GIRL?

37
00:01:32,842 --> 00:01:34,093
- SURELY'S DYING?

38
00:01:34,093 --> 00:01:36,929
- I FIGURE I'LL KILL HER OFF 
JUST BEFORE GRADUATION.

39
00:01:36,929 --> 00:01:38,723
JUST SO EVERYONE 
GETS REALLY SAD BEFORE PROM.

40
00:01:38,723 --> 00:01:40,391
- MAEBY, SOMEONE'S 
GOING TO GET HURT.

41
00:01:40,391 --> 00:01:42,059
NOT TO MENTION IT'S KIND OF 
DISRESPECTFUL

42
00:01:42,059 --> 00:01:43,353
FOR KIDS 
WHO ACTUALLY HAVE THIS.

43
00:01:43,353 --> 00:01:44,895
- NOT A LOT OF KIDS 
HAVE B.S. THESE DAYS.

44
00:01:44,895 --> 00:01:46,481
- WHAT DOES THAT STAND FOR?

45
00:01:46,481 --> 00:01:48,858
- I DON'T KNOW. 
IT'S B.S.

46
00:01:50,401 --> 00:01:52,528
narrator: MICHAEL WRESTLED 
WITH THE DILEMMA

47
00:01:52,528 --> 00:01:54,822
OF WHETHER HE SHOULD LOOK 
AT THE EVIDENCE FILE

48
00:01:54,822 --> 00:01:57,117
OF THE CASE 
AGAINST HIS FATHER.

49
00:01:57,117 --> 00:01:58,368
- MICHAEL.

50
00:01:58,368 --> 00:02:00,495
- HEY, GOB. 
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU WEARING?

51
00:02:00,495 --> 00:02:03,206
- WHAT? OH, THIS--

52
00:02:03,206 --> 00:02:05,333
THE WIFE LIKES ME 
IN BRIGHT SWEATERS.

53
00:02:05,333 --> 00:02:08,628
narrator: GOB, IN A SERIES 
OF ESCALATING DARES,

54
00:02:08,628 --> 00:02:09,879
RECENTLY GOT MARRIED TO 
A WOMAN

55
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:11,422
HE HAD ONLY KNOWN 
FOR AN EVENING.

56
00:02:11,422 --> 00:02:14,217
- YOUR WIFE? 
SHE'S STILL YOUR WIFE?

57
00:02:14,217 --> 00:02:15,968
- WELL, I WENT TO 
BREAK UP WITH HER LAST NIGHT,

58
00:02:15,968 --> 00:02:17,803
BUT MY TIMING WAS NOT GREAT.

59
00:02:17,803 --> 00:02:19,054
- SO I THINK WE SHOULD TALK.

60
00:02:19,054 --> 00:02:21,766
- MY PARENTS 
ARE GETTING A DIVORCE.

61
00:02:21,766 --> 00:02:23,017
[crying]

62
00:02:23,017 --> 00:02:24,769
WHY AREN'T YOU WEARING 
THAT SWEATER I BOUGHT YOU?

63
00:02:24,769 --> 00:02:25,811
WHAT, YOU DON'T LIKE IT?

64
00:02:25,811 --> 00:02:26,812
- NO. OF COURSE I LIKE IT.

65
00:02:26,812 --> 00:02:28,856
JUST BECAUSE I LIKE IT 
DOESN'T MEAN I HAVE TO WEAR IT.

66
00:02:28,856 --> 00:02:30,483
I DON'T WEAR EVERYTHING I LIKE 
EVERY DAY.

67
00:02:30,483 --> 00:02:31,776
- WHY DON'T WE 
JUST GET A DIVORCE?

68
00:02:31,776 --> 00:02:32,860
EVERYBODY ELSE IS.

69
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:36,531
- NO! WE'RE NOT 
GETTING DIVORCED.

70
00:02:36,531 --> 00:02:39,409
SHE REALLY WANTS TO 
STAY TOGETHER, SO--

71
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:42,703
- WELL, LEAST YOU FINALLY 
CONSUMMATED IT, HUH?

72
00:02:42,703 --> 00:02:44,997
- [laughs] 
"CONSUMMATED."

73
00:02:44,997 --> 00:02:46,416
WHAT IS UP WITH 
THAT "PROSECUTIE"?

74
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:47,625
- [groans]

75
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:49,043
- I HOPE YOU DIDN'T 
BREAK UP WITH HER?

76
00:02:49,043 --> 00:02:49,752
- NO, I DIDN'T.

77
00:02:49,752 --> 00:02:51,462
AND TO MAKE MATTERS WORSE, 
SHE GAVE ME THIS.

78
00:02:51,462 --> 00:02:53,714
IT'S A SUMMARY OF THE EVIDENCE 
THAT THEY HAVE AGAINST DAD.

79
00:02:53,714 --> 00:02:57,343
- OKAY, MICHAEL. 
THIS MAKES MATTERS BETTER.

80
00:02:57,343 --> 00:02:59,512
LET'S JUST DESTROY IT 
AND MOVE ON WITH OUR LIVES.

81
00:02:59,512 --> 00:03:00,846
- THIS IS NOT 
THE ACTUAL EVIDENCE.

82
00:03:00,846 --> 00:03:02,473
IT'S JUST A LIST OF 
THE EVIDENCE.

83
00:03:02,473 --> 00:03:04,600
AND JUDGING BY THE AMOUNT 
OF BOXES SHE HAS IN HER PLACE,

84
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,935
I HAVE A FEELING THERE'S A LOT.

85
00:03:05,935 --> 00:03:07,186
- A FEELING?

86
00:03:07,186 --> 00:03:09,689
OH, DON'T TELL ME YOU WON'T OPEN 
IT ON ETHICAL GROUNDS?

87
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:11,816
- I'M NOT SURE 
WHAT I'M GOING TO DO.

88
00:03:11,816 --> 00:03:13,818
- WHAT IS WITH THE INSANE 
MORAL CODE IN THIS FAMILY?

89
00:03:13,818 --> 00:03:15,528
- YES, WE DID IT.

90
00:03:15,528 --> 00:03:17,238
WE'RE GETTING RID 
OF THE TEN COMMANDMENTS.

91
00:03:17,238 --> 00:03:18,948
YOU KNOW, THE GRANITE ONES 
IN FRONT OF THE COURTHOUSE.

92
00:03:18,948 --> 00:03:21,033
YOU KNOW, ALL IT TOOK 
WAS THE THREAT OF A LAWSUIT.

93
00:03:21,033 --> 00:03:22,827
- YOU'RE INVOLVED WITH 
THOSE PROTESTERS NOW?

94
00:03:22,827 --> 00:03:23,869
WHEN DID THAT HAPPEN?

95
00:03:23,869 --> 00:03:25,830
- OH, WHO CAN REMEMBER.

96
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:28,249
narrator: LINDSAY'S INVOLVEMENT 
BEGAN HOURS BEFORE

97
00:03:28,249 --> 00:03:30,710
WHEN, LEAVING THE PLEA HEARING, 
SHE FIRST DETERMINED

98
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:32,878
THE TEN COMMANDMENTS 
DIDN'T BELONG THERE.

99
00:03:32,878 --> 00:03:34,880
- AND THEY WON'T EVEN ALLOW 
ME ONE LOUSY CIGARETTE!

100
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:37,217
- [gasps] 
OH.

101
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:39,051
HONEY, THEY'RE JUST HEELS.

102
00:03:39,051 --> 00:03:41,221
THEY CAN ONLY SUPPORT 
SO MUCH WEIGHT.

103
00:03:47,017 --> 00:03:48,478
- I'VE ALWAYS 
BEEN VERY PASSIONATE

104
00:03:48,478 --> 00:03:50,230
ABOUT THE SEPARATION 
OF CHURCH AND STATE.

105
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:51,522
- WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO 
WITH THEM?

106
00:03:51,522 --> 00:03:53,107
- OH, I DON'T KNOW. 
GIVE 'EM TO A SCHOOL.

107
00:03:53,107 --> 00:03:55,860
- CAN WE LET ANOTHER FAMILY 
BRING DOWN THE TEN COMMANDMENTS?

108
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:57,903
THIS FAMILY'S ALREADY DONE 
MORE THAN ITS SHARE.

109
00:03:57,903 --> 00:04:00,656
- OH, NOW YOU LOVE 
THE TEN COMMANDMENTS.

110
00:04:00,656 --> 00:04:02,658
AND YET, YOU'RE THE ONE 
WHO SO CONVENIENTLY FORGOT

111
00:04:02,658 --> 00:04:04,577
"THOU SHALT PROTECT THY FATHER,

112
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:06,371
AND HONOR NO ONE ABOVE HIM 
UNLESS IT BEITH ME--

113
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:08,956
THY SWEET LORD."

114
00:04:08,956 --> 00:04:11,041
- I'M NOT SURE THAT ONE 
MADE IT DOWN THE MOUNTAIN, GOB.

115
00:04:11,041 --> 00:04:12,418
- I TOLD YOU SOMEONE 
WOULD GET HURT.

116
00:04:12,418 --> 00:04:14,128
- YEAH, WELL, IF I KNEW 
IT WAS GOING TO BE YOU,

117
00:04:14,128 --> 00:04:15,588
I WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN 
SO WORRIED.

118
00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:16,672
- HEY, WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?

119
00:04:16,672 --> 00:04:18,424
- HE WAS TRYING TO HELP SOME 
HANDICAPPED GIRL

120
00:04:18,424 --> 00:04:20,593
UP TO THE BLEACHERS, 
AND HE FELL.

121
00:04:20,593 --> 00:04:21,844
- IT'S JUST A SPRAIN.

122
00:04:21,844 --> 00:04:24,013
BUT AT LEAST 
IT'S LEGITIMATE.

123
00:04:24,013 --> 00:04:25,265
- AH, LE CLUMSY ADOLESCENCE.

124
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:27,600
IT'S A PHASE 
WE'VE ALL BEEN THROUGH.

125
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,851
EXCEPT FOR ME.

126
00:04:28,851 --> 00:04:30,102
I WAS LIKE A CAT.

127
00:04:30,102 --> 00:04:32,730
I ALWAYS ENDED UP ON ALL FOURS.

128
00:04:35,358 --> 00:04:36,609
LIKE A CAT.

129
00:04:36,609 --> 00:04:37,860
- WAIT A MINUTE.

130
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:39,445
THEY DON'T HAVE RAMPS 
AT YOUR SCHOOL?

131
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:40,696
- WELL, NOT UP THE BLEACHERS.

132
00:04:40,696 --> 00:04:42,490
- YOU SHOULD THREATEN TO SUE.

133
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:44,116
IT'S FREE IF IT'S JUST 
A THREAT, YOU KNOW.

134
00:04:44,116 --> 00:04:45,826
- HEY, THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.

135
00:04:45,826 --> 00:04:47,412
- ALL RIGHT, 
NO ONE'S GONNA SUE ANYBODY.

136
00:04:47,412 --> 00:04:48,663
I'M NOT GONNA HAVE MY SON

137
00:04:48,663 --> 00:04:51,291
START ABUSING THE LEGAL SYSTEM 
LIKE THE REST OF THIS FAMILY.

138
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:55,836
AFTER ALL, WE'RE GONNA NEED IT 
FOR YEARS TO COME.

139
00:04:55,836 --> 00:04:57,547
narrator: AND THAT'S 
WHEN MICHAEL DECIDED

140
00:04:57,547 --> 00:05:01,967
TO DO THE RIGHT THING.

141
00:05:01,967 --> 00:05:03,218
- SO WHAT DO YOU THINK?

142
00:05:03,218 --> 00:05:06,722
DO WE HAVE A CASE AGAINST 
THIS IDIOT FAMILY OR WHAT?

143
00:05:06,722 --> 00:05:09,767
- WELL, THAT'S ACTUALLY WHY 
I WANTED TO TALK TO YOU, MAGGIE.

144
00:05:09,767 --> 00:05:11,018
YOU SEE, UH, IT TURNS OUT

145
00:05:11,018 --> 00:05:15,523
THAT I AM ACTUALLY 
ONE OF THOSE IDIOTS.

146
00:05:15,523 --> 00:05:16,774
I MIGHT EVEN BE THE MAIN IDIOT.

147
00:05:16,774 --> 00:05:20,069
WELL, I'M NOT THE MAIN IDIOT, 
BUT I'M THE IDIOT IN CHARGE.

148
00:05:20,069 --> 00:05:22,988
YEAH. I'M MICHAEL BLUTH. 
OKAY?

149
00:05:22,988 --> 00:05:25,491
AND I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT 
I NEVER OPENED UP THIS FOLDER.

150
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:28,869
AND IF YOU COULD SEE MY FACE,

151
00:05:28,869 --> 00:05:32,081
UH, YOU'D SEE HOW SORRY I AM 
THAT I LIED TO YOU.

152
00:05:35,167 --> 00:05:37,378
- YOU FEEL SINCERE.

153
00:05:37,378 --> 00:05:38,879
DAMN IT.

154
00:05:38,879 --> 00:05:41,674
I HAVE SPENT THE LAST FIVE HOURS 
HATING YOU

155
00:05:41,674 --> 00:05:44,218
EVER SINCE I FOUND OUT YOU WERE 
MICHAEL BLUTH IN COURT.

156
00:05:44,218 --> 00:05:45,470
- WHAT? HOW DID YOU KNOW?

157
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:48,180
- I'M BLIND, MICHAEL.

158
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:49,432
I'M NOT STUFFED UP.

159
00:05:49,432 --> 00:05:50,683
- YOU SMELLED ME.

160
00:05:50,683 --> 00:05:51,934
- I SMELLED YOU, BABY.

161
00:05:51,934 --> 00:05:54,520
- MAGGIE, WHY DIDN'T YOU 
TELL ME AT YOUR HOUSE?

162
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,689
AND WHY DID YOU GIVE ME 
THIS FOLDER?

163
00:05:56,689 --> 00:05:57,940
- I WAS MANIPULATING YOU.

164
00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:00,359
THIS ISN'T THE REAL LIST.

165
00:06:00,359 --> 00:06:01,611
THIS IS A WISH LIST.

166
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:04,154
- I CAN'T BELIEVE 
YOU SET ME UP.

167
00:06:04,154 --> 00:06:06,741
- WELL, YOU LIED TO ME. 
CHARETH CUTESTORY?

168
00:06:06,741 --> 00:06:08,909
- I KNOW."THOU SHALT NOT 
MAKE UP A NAME IN VAIN."

169
00:06:08,909 --> 00:06:10,536
BUT, YOU KNOW, 
I WALKED INTO THAT COURT.

170
00:06:10,536 --> 00:06:12,705
AND I SAW YOU THERE,

171
00:06:12,705 --> 00:06:13,956
AND--THIS CAN'T HAPPEN, RIGHT?

172
00:06:13,956 --> 00:06:16,208
- YOU'RE DAMN RIGHT 
THIS CAN'T HAPPEN.

173
00:06:16,208 --> 00:06:17,334
LOOK AT ME.

174
00:06:17,334 --> 00:06:18,335
THIS COULD GET ME--

175
00:06:18,335 --> 00:06:19,587
ARE YOU ACTUALLY LOOKING AT ME?

176
00:06:19,587 --> 00:06:20,796
- YES, I AM.

177
00:06:20,796 --> 00:06:23,007
- OKAY. I COULD GET 
DISBARRED FOR THIS.

178
00:06:23,007 --> 00:06:25,885
AND YOUR DAD WOULD HAVE TO 
SPEND TONS MORE TIME IN PRISON.

179
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:27,136
I GOTTA TELL YOU SOMETHING.

180
00:06:27,136 --> 00:06:28,804
THE THING THAT REALLY 
GETS TO ME IS

181
00:06:28,804 --> 00:06:32,850
THAT I KEEP HEARING THAT MICHAEL 
BLUTH IS SO--[bleep] CUTE.

182
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:36,479
- WELL, I KNOW MAGGIE LIZER 
IS...ADORABLE.

183
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:38,606
YOU DON'T KNOW 
WHAT YOU'RE MISSING.

184
00:06:38,606 --> 00:06:40,483
- REALLY? 
- REALLY.

185
00:06:40,483 --> 00:06:41,734
SO WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?

186
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:45,195
- I GUESS WE'RE JUST GONNA 
HAVE TO GO OUR SEPARATE WAYS

187
00:06:45,195 --> 00:06:46,864
AND AGREE TO NEVER 
SPEAK ABOUT THIS AGAIN.

188
00:06:46,864 --> 00:06:48,449
- THAT IS PROBABLY BEST, HUH?

189
00:06:48,449 --> 00:06:52,620
- LOOK, THE LEAST YOU CAN DO 
IS BUY ME A DRINK.

190
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:55,456
- HMM. YEAH. I'LL STAY 
FOR ONE DRINK.

191
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:03,088
[Maggie whooping]

192
00:07:07,134 --> 00:07:08,385
narrator: THE NEXT MORNING,

193
00:07:08,385 --> 00:07:10,430
MICHAEL, ONCE AGAIN, 
FOUND HIMSELF AT MAGGIE'S.

194
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,389
AND ONCE AGAIN, BERATED HIMSELF 
FOR THE MISTAKE.

195
00:07:12,389 --> 00:07:13,390
- OH, NO.

196
00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:15,225
I'M SUPPOSED TO BE AT 
THE PRISON TO TALK TO MY DAD

197
00:07:15,225 --> 00:07:16,226
IN HALF AN HOUR.

198
00:07:16,226 --> 00:07:17,603
- I CAN'T BELIEVE 
WE DID THIS AGAIN.

199
00:07:17,603 --> 00:07:19,647
- IT WAS SO STUPID.

200
00:07:19,647 --> 00:07:20,898
- INCREDIBLY STUPID.

201
00:07:20,898 --> 00:07:25,360
IT'S LIKE WE'RE MAKING 
NAUGHTY SEX EVEN NAUGHTIER.

202
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,613
[both panting]

203
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:29,824
- OH, NO. I WAS SUPPOSED TO BE 
AT THE PRISON TO TALK TO MY DAD

204
00:07:29,824 --> 00:07:31,033
A HALF AN HOUR AGO.

205
00:07:31,033 --> 00:07:33,410
- OH, THIS IS BAD. 
THIS IS REALLY BAD.

206
00:07:33,410 --> 00:07:36,121
THIS IS THE SECOND MOST 
UNETHICAL THING I'VE EVER DONE.

207
00:07:36,121 --> 00:07:38,207
- WE CANNOT PRETEND THAT 
THIS DIDN'T HAPPEN, MAGGIE.

208
00:07:38,207 --> 00:07:39,709
- OR THAT IT WON'T HAPPEN AGAIN.

209
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:41,752
- YOU THINK IT'S GONNA 
HAPPEN AGAIN?

210
00:07:41,752 --> 00:07:43,463
- YOU TELL ME.

211
00:07:45,673 --> 00:07:48,468
- LET'S JUST ASSUME THAT IT WILL 
HAPPEN AGAIN AT SOME TIME.

212
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:50,385
- RIGHT. RIGHT.

213
00:07:50,385 --> 00:07:52,179
- WE JUST NEED TO, YOU KNOW, 
ACKNOWLEDGE THIS

214
00:07:52,179 --> 00:07:53,430
AND KEEP IT PRIVATE,

215
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:55,641
AND I DON'T THINK THAT THERE'S 
ANYTHING WRONG WITH THAT.

216
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:57,893
- RIGHT. 
I MEAN, I HAVE A JOB, YOU KNOW?

217
00:07:57,893 --> 00:07:59,854
I'M TRYING TO KEEP A MAN 
IN PRISON.

218
00:07:59,854 --> 00:08:01,606
- RIGHT. AND THAT MAN 
HAPPENS TO BE MY FATHER.

219
00:08:01,606 --> 00:08:03,023
- [groans]

220
00:08:03,023 --> 00:08:04,024
- THIS COULD GET UGLY.

221
00:08:04,024 --> 00:08:06,777
- WELL, IT'S LIKE 
THE TEN COMMANDMENTS SAYING.

222
00:08:06,777 --> 00:08:09,655
"BE TRUE TO THINE OWN SELF, 
AND TO THINE OWN SELF--"

223
00:08:09,655 --> 00:08:11,073
- "BE TRUE." YEAH.

224
00:08:11,073 --> 00:08:12,074
NUMBER SEVEN.

225
00:08:12,074 --> 00:08:14,118
- WE'LL JUST HAVE TO 
KEEP IT A SECRET.

226
00:08:14,118 --> 00:08:15,745
- OUR SECRET.

227
00:08:15,745 --> 00:08:19,206
- OUR DIRTY LITTLE SECRET.

228
00:08:19,206 --> 00:08:20,207
- I THINK I'M READY NOW.

229
00:08:20,207 --> 00:08:23,252
- ALL RIGHT. 
- OKAY.

230
00:08:23,252 --> 00:08:24,587
narrator: 
32 MINUTES EARLIER,

231
00:08:24,587 --> 00:08:27,256
GOB, LUCILLE, AND BARRY 
MET WITH GEORGE SR.

232
00:08:27,256 --> 00:08:28,257
- WHERE DID YOU GET THIS?

233
00:08:28,257 --> 00:08:31,468
- THEY DON'T CALL ME A SLEIGHT- 
OF-HAND ARTIST FOR NOTHING.

234
00:08:31,468 --> 00:08:33,053
narrator: GOB HAD SWITCHED 
OUT THE FILE

235
00:08:33,053 --> 00:08:36,641
WHILE HIS SIBLINGS 
DISCUSSED THE TEN COMMANDMENTS.

236
00:08:36,641 --> 00:08:38,058
- I'VE ALWAYS BEEN 
VERY PASSIONATE

237
00:08:38,058 --> 00:08:39,810
ABOUT THE SEPARATION 
OF CHURCH AND STATE.

238
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:41,103
- WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO 
WITH THEM?

239
00:08:41,103 --> 00:08:42,772
- GIVE 'EM TO A SCHOOL.

240
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:45,315
- CAN WE LET ANOTHER FAMILY 
BRING DOWN THE TEN COMMANDMENTS?

241
00:08:45,315 --> 00:08:47,442
THIS FAMILY'S ALREADY DONE 
MORE THAN ITS SHARE.

242
00:08:47,442 --> 00:08:50,070
- NOW YOU LOVE 
THE TEN COMMANDMENTS.

243
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:53,490
APPARENTLY, THERE ARE BOXES 
OF IT AT THE PROSECUTOR'S HOUSE.

244
00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:54,742
I TRACKED DOWN THE ADDRESS,

245
00:08:54,742 --> 00:08:56,577
AND YOU SHOULD BE 
THANKING ME FOR THIS.

246
00:08:56,577 --> 00:08:57,953
MICHAEL DIDN'T WANT YOU 
TO HAVE IT.

247
00:08:57,953 --> 00:08:59,664
[mocking] MR. MORAL.

248
00:08:59,664 --> 00:09:03,292
- MM. YEAH, WE DID SOMETHING 
RIGHT THERE, HUH?

249
00:09:03,292 --> 00:09:04,544
- SO WHAT DO YOU THINK, BARRY?

250
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:06,754
- I-I HAVEN'T READ IT.

251
00:09:06,754 --> 00:09:09,840
I HAD A REALLY INTERESTING 
DATE LAST NIGHT.

252
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:13,093
A WOMAN WHO 
ACTUALLY WORKS TWO JOBS.

253
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:18,515
- WELL, IT CERTAINLY LOOKS LIKE 
THEY'VE GOT A LOT ON US.

254
00:09:18,515 --> 00:09:19,767
- MM-HMM. 
- UH, YOU.

255
00:09:19,767 --> 00:09:21,769
I WAS RAISING THE CHILDREN.

256
00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:23,854
- WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME 
YOU RAISED CHILDREN?

257
00:09:23,854 --> 00:09:25,105
- EXCUSE ME?

258
00:09:25,105 --> 00:09:27,983
I'VE GOT TWO IN THE WAITING ROOM 
RIGHT THIS MOMENT.

259
00:09:27,983 --> 00:09:30,277
narrator: 
IN FACT, BUSTER AND ANNYONG,

260
00:09:30,277 --> 00:09:33,656
LUCILLE'S NEWLY ADOPTED 
KOREAN CHILD, WERE WAITING.

261
00:09:33,656 --> 00:09:36,867
- WOW. I WONDER WHAT THEY'RE 
TALKING ABOUT IN THERE?

262
00:09:36,867 --> 00:09:38,285
- THEY DON'T TELL YOU 
ANYTHING, HUH?

263
00:09:38,285 --> 00:09:40,746
- THEY TELL ME THINGS.

264
00:09:40,746 --> 00:09:41,789
IT DOESN'T MATTER THOUGH,

265
00:09:41,789 --> 00:09:44,458
BECAUSE DAD IS GONNA BE 
IN HERE A LONG TIME.

266
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:46,085
[chuckles] 
- NO.

267
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:47,712
WE HAVE COURT DAY TODAY.

268
00:09:47,712 --> 00:09:48,963
THEY TAKE PLEA.

269
00:09:48,963 --> 00:09:51,799
DADDY COME HOME. 
YOU OUT.

270
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:54,343
narrator: ANNYONG HAD HIT A 
NERVE, AND BUSTER RECALLED

271
00:09:54,343 --> 00:09:56,136
THAT RIGHT BEFORE 
GEORGE SR.'s ARREST,

272
00:09:56,136 --> 00:09:58,263
HE'D MADE A SIMILAR THREAT.

273
00:09:58,263 --> 00:10:02,517
- I SAID HE COULD WEAR THAT TIE. 
IT LOOKS BETTER ON HIM.

274
00:10:02,517 --> 00:10:04,061
- NO, NO. LET ME 
HELP YOU WITH THAT, SON.

275
00:10:04,061 --> 00:10:05,062
- OH.

276
00:10:05,062 --> 00:10:09,108
- HEY, ENJOY YOURSELF TONIGHT, 
BECAUSE YOU ARE OUT OF HERE.

277
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:10,442
I'M NOT GONNA SPEND MY 
RETIREMENT

278
00:10:10,442 --> 00:10:13,738
WATCHING YOU 
WIPE YOUR NOSE ON YOUR SLEEVE.

279
00:10:13,738 --> 00:10:15,656
- I CAN'T BREATHE, DAD. 
- NEITHER CAN I.

280
00:10:15,656 --> 00:10:17,324
- [whimpers]

281
00:10:17,324 --> 00:10:18,659
- I HAVEN'T SEEN 
HALF THIS STUFF,

282
00:10:18,659 --> 00:10:21,245
BUT THEY'VE GOT THESE 
KIND OF DOCUMENTS, UH,

283
00:10:21,245 --> 00:10:23,288
WE'VE GOTTA GET RID OF THIS.

284
00:10:23,288 --> 00:10:25,124
- IF YOU'RE THINKING OF 
STEALING THE EVIDENCE,

285
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:27,251
THAT IS A VERY BIG OFFENSE.

286
00:10:27,251 --> 00:10:29,461
I-I THINK I'M GONNA SAY

287
00:10:29,461 --> 00:10:31,881
THAT I SIGNED MYSELF OUT 
ABOUT 10 MINUTES AGO.

288
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:34,634
- YOU'RE RIGHT. 
YOU CAN'T AFFORD TO GET CAUGHT.

289
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:35,926
I DON'T NEED MY LAWYER 
IN PRISON.

290
00:10:35,926 --> 00:10:38,303
WE'LL HAVE GOB 
BREAK IN.

291
00:10:38,303 --> 00:10:42,057
- WELL, GEE, DAD, 
I'VE GOT A WIFE NOW.

292
00:10:42,057 --> 00:10:44,559
I DON'T THINK THAT I CAN 
AFFORD TO GET CAUGHT EITHER.

293
00:10:44,559 --> 00:10:46,311
- GOOD POINT.

294
00:10:46,311 --> 00:10:49,857
YOU MIGHT WANT TO 
CHANGE OUT OF THAT SWEATER.

295
00:10:49,857 --> 00:10:52,359
- TELL ME AGAIN 
WHY THIS ISN'T WRONG.

296
00:10:52,359 --> 00:10:53,903
- LOOK. WE ARE JUST-- 
WE'RE TWO ADULTS.

297
00:10:53,903 --> 00:10:55,696
WE'VE GOT ABSOLUTELY NOTHING--

298
00:10:55,696 --> 00:10:56,947
COPS. HIDE.

299
00:10:56,947 --> 00:10:59,241
- MS. LIZER.

300
00:10:59,241 --> 00:11:01,451
IT'S OFFICER KELLEY. 
- OH, HI.

301
00:11:01,451 --> 00:11:03,203
- YOUR OFFICE HAS ASKED ME 
TO COME PICK YOU UP.

302
00:11:03,203 --> 00:11:06,206
IT'S A SURPRISE.

303
00:11:06,206 --> 00:11:08,208
I JUST WINKED. 
IT'S A SURPRISE WITNESS.

304
00:11:08,208 --> 00:11:10,044
- OH, GREAT.

305
00:11:10,044 --> 00:11:11,962
UM-- 
- HOW ARE WE DOING?

306
00:11:11,962 --> 00:11:13,213
- I'LL JUST PUT MY DOG INSIDE,

307
00:11:13,213 --> 00:11:16,425
AND THEN I WILL BE 
RIGHT WITH YOU.

308
00:11:16,425 --> 00:11:17,426
- I'LL TAKE THE DOG, OKAY?

309
00:11:17,426 --> 00:11:19,344
I'VE ALREADY MISSED MY MEETING. 
YOU GO AHEAD.

310
00:11:19,344 --> 00:11:20,805
- JUST PUT HIM 
THROUGH THE DOGGY DOOR.

311
00:11:20,805 --> 00:11:22,222
- OKAY.

312
00:11:22,222 --> 00:11:23,766
- AND, UH, 
I'LL SEE YOU IN COURT.

313
00:11:23,766 --> 00:11:24,850
- YEAH.

314
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:26,811
MY DAD'S NOT GONNA 
PUT HIMSELF IN PRISON FOR LIFE.

315
00:11:26,811 --> 00:11:28,062
- YEAH. 
- BYE. KISS.

316
00:11:28,062 --> 00:11:29,104
- OH.

317
00:11:29,104 --> 00:11:30,564
narrator: AND GOB 
DECIDED TO PASS OFF

318
00:11:30,564 --> 00:11:32,775
HIS BREAK-IN ASSIGNMENT 
TO TOBIAS.

319
00:11:32,775 --> 00:11:34,026
- HEY, THERE'S THE CAT.

320
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:36,987
SORRY YOU COULDN'T HAVE BEEN 
DOWN AT THE PRISON WITH US.

321
00:11:36,987 --> 00:11:39,073
DAD WAS ASKING ALL ABOUT YOU.

322
00:11:39,073 --> 00:11:41,992
- OH. I DOUBT THAT VERY MUCH.

323
00:11:41,992 --> 00:11:43,243
- LOOK, I'M NOT GONNA 
LIE TO YOU.

324
00:11:43,243 --> 00:11:46,997
HE FEELS YOU'VE BEEN SUCKING 
OFF THIS FAMILY FAR TOO LONG.

325
00:11:46,997 --> 00:11:49,041
IF YOU DON'T START PULLING 
YOUR WEIGHT AROUND HERE,

326
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:51,877
IT'S GONNA BE SHAPE UP 
OR SHIP UP.

327
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:53,128
- YOU KNOW, TRY AS I MIGHT,

328
00:11:53,128 --> 00:11:56,256
I CANNOT SEEM TO 
IMPRESS THAT MAN.

329
00:11:56,256 --> 00:11:57,507
- ISN'T THAT FUNNY? 
[chuckles]

330
00:11:57,507 --> 00:12:00,010
I'M ABOUT TO 
KNOCK HIS SOCKS OFF AGAIN.

331
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:01,470
YEAH, I'M GONNA BREAK INTO 
THIS HOUSE

332
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:03,597
THAT'S GOT A BUNCH 
OF EVIDENCE IN IT.

333
00:12:03,597 --> 00:12:06,433
JUST TO BORROW IT. 
ENSURE HIS FREEDOM FOREVER.

334
00:12:06,433 --> 00:12:11,271
BUT, IT'S A TOUGH JOB. 
MIGHT REQUIRE SOME AGILITY.

335
00:12:11,271 --> 00:12:14,524
- [whispering] 
THIS KIND OF AGILITY?

336
00:12:14,524 --> 00:12:17,569
- LET'S GO, LITTLE MAN.

337
00:12:17,569 --> 00:12:18,821
narrator: MICHAEL, MEANWHILE,

338
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:23,075
HAD DECIDED TO SEE WHAT LIFE 
IN MAGGIE'S WORLD WAS LIKE.

339
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:26,829
- ALL RIGHT. OKAY.

340
00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:31,000
ALL RIGHT. OKAY.

341
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,251
OKAY.

342
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:33,502
- THIS GUY'S THE REAL DEAL.

343
00:12:33,502 --> 00:12:35,045
HE'S ON THE INSIDE.

344
00:12:35,045 --> 00:12:36,296
BUT HE'S GOT SOME DEMANDS.

345
00:12:36,296 --> 00:12:39,133
- THIS COULD BE 
THE BREAK WE WANTED.

346
00:12:39,133 --> 00:12:40,509
- THIS IS 
DISTRICT ATTORNEY LIZER.

347
00:12:40,509 --> 00:12:42,511
- ALL RIGHT. 
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

348
00:12:42,511 --> 00:12:46,181
- UH, I-I WANT IMMUNITY 
FOR ME AND MY MOM,

349
00:12:46,181 --> 00:12:49,684
AND I WANT 
MY DAD TO STAY IN PRISON.

350
00:12:49,684 --> 00:12:51,770
ALSO, CAN YOU SEND 
ANNYONG BACK TO KOREA?

351
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:52,938
- HUH?

352
00:12:54,648 --> 00:12:57,359
- HEY! 
- JUSTICE!

353
00:12:57,359 --> 00:12:59,486
[horn honking] 
[tires screeching]

354
00:12:59,486 --> 00:13:00,487
narrator: MEANWHILE,

355
00:13:00,487 --> 00:13:02,948
MAGGIE'S INTERROGATION OF 
BUSTER WAS PROVING FRUITLESS.

356
00:13:02,948 --> 00:13:04,199
- DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING

357
00:13:04,199 --> 00:13:07,577
ABOUT YOUR FATHER'S TRIPS 
OVERSEAS?

358
00:13:07,577 --> 00:13:11,165
- I KNEW I'D HAVE A FUN TIME 
AT HOME ALONE WITH MOM.

359
00:13:11,165 --> 00:13:15,002
- FINE. DID YOU EVER SEE HIM 
RETURN FROM THESE TRIPS

360
00:13:15,002 --> 00:13:16,461
WITH ANYTHING UNUSUAL?

361
00:13:16,461 --> 00:13:17,838
- YEAH.

362
00:13:17,838 --> 00:13:20,841
HE CAME BACK HOME ONCE 
WITH A BLACK STATUE

363
00:13:20,841 --> 00:13:22,592
WITH AN ERECT PENIS.

364
00:13:23,802 --> 00:13:26,471
IT STAYED IN OUR LIVING ROOM 
UNTIL MY AUNT OBJECTED.

365
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:31,393
- WHAT ABOUT 
BUSINESS ASSOCIATES?

366
00:13:31,393 --> 00:13:33,395
- I HAVE NONE. 
- ALL RIGHT.

367
00:13:33,395 --> 00:13:34,646
THIS GUY'S WASTING OUR TIME.

368
00:13:34,646 --> 00:13:36,356
TAKE AWAY HIS GRILLED CHEESE.

369
00:13:36,356 --> 00:13:40,777
- [stammering] 
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

370
00:13:40,777 --> 00:13:42,988
IF IT'S EVIDENCE YOU WANT, 
I KNOW WHERE THEY KEEP IT.

371
00:13:42,988 --> 00:13:44,739
ACCORDING TO MY BROTHER,

372
00:13:44,739 --> 00:13:47,701
THERE ARE BOXES OF EVIDENCE 
IN A HOUSE ON SCENIC VIEW DRIVE.

373
00:13:47,701 --> 00:13:51,413
- ISN'T THAT WHERE YOU LIVE? 
- YEAH.

374
00:13:51,413 --> 00:13:53,748
AND I'M HEADED THERE NOW.

375
00:13:55,542 --> 00:13:58,795
narrator: TOBIAS, MEANWHILE, 
HAD USED HIS CATLIKE AGILITY

376
00:13:58,795 --> 00:14:00,714
TO GET THE EVIDENCE 
AT MAGGIE'S HOUSE.

377
00:14:00,714 --> 00:14:03,425
- THE CAT IS IN.

378
00:14:03,425 --> 00:14:08,805
narrator: UNFORTUNATELY, IT WAS 
JUST AS MAGGIE CAME HOME.

379
00:14:08,805 --> 00:14:14,019
[sniffing]

380
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:17,106
[sniffs] 
IS THERE SOMEONE HERE?

381
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:18,523
narrator: 
TOBIAS, CONCERNED ABOUT

382
00:14:18,523 --> 00:14:20,359
MAGGIE'S 
HEIGHTENED SENSE OF SMELL,

383
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:24,279
SET OFF TO CLOAK HIMSELF 
IN HER SCENT.

384
00:14:39,794 --> 00:14:41,255
- AND MICHAEL WAS AT 
THE VET'S OFFICE.

385
00:14:41,255 --> 00:14:43,132
- JUSTICE IS FINE.

386
00:14:43,132 --> 00:14:44,383
- GREAT.

387
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:46,927
- ALTHOUGH, DRESSING HIM UP 
LIKE A SEEING-EYE DOG

388
00:14:46,927 --> 00:14:48,178
SEEMS A LITTLE CRUEL.

389
00:14:48,178 --> 00:14:49,513
- CRUEL?

390
00:14:49,513 --> 00:14:51,598
- WELL, YEAH, 
BECAUSE HE CAN'T SEE.

391
00:14:51,598 --> 00:14:53,267
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

392
00:14:53,267 --> 00:14:56,561
- MR. BLUTH, 
JUSTICE IS BLIND.

393
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:05,654
- JUSTICE 
CANNOT BE BLIND, DOC.

394
00:15:05,654 --> 00:15:06,989
HE'S GOT A HANDLE 
AND EVERYTHING.

395
00:15:06,989 --> 00:15:08,991
COME ON, BOY.

396
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:17,082
MAYBE HIS PERIPHERAL 
ISN'T GREAT,

397
00:15:17,082 --> 00:15:19,668
BUT HE'S BEEN LEADING 
A BLIND WOMAN AROUND.

398
00:15:19,668 --> 00:15:22,129
- I THINK SHE'S BEEN 
LEADING HIM AROUND.

399
00:15:22,129 --> 00:15:25,549
- BUT THAT WOULD MEAN THAT 
MAGGIE ISN'T BLIND.

400
00:15:25,549 --> 00:15:27,717
narrator: 
IN FACT, MAGGIE WASN'T BLIND,

401
00:15:27,717 --> 00:15:29,803
BUT HAD BEEN PRETENDING 
TO BE...

402
00:15:29,803 --> 00:15:30,971
- SON OF A BITCH.

403
00:15:30,971 --> 00:15:33,432
narrator: SINCE SHE FOUND IT 
HELPFUL IN TAKING THE LSATs.

404
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:35,684
- "D." "B" PLACES FOURTH.

405
00:15:40,147 --> 00:15:41,398
- "A"?

406
00:15:41,398 --> 00:15:42,983
narrator: 
FINDING IT A TREMENDOUS BOON

407
00:15:42,983 --> 00:15:45,110
TO HER PROFESSIONAL LIFE, 
MAGGIE CONTINUED THE RUSE.

408
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:48,697
- I SUBMIT INTO EVIDENCE 
THIS WINE GLASS

409
00:15:48,697 --> 00:15:50,157
WITH THE DEFENDANT'S 
FINGERPRINTS.

410
00:15:50,157 --> 00:15:53,243
[glass shatters]

411
00:15:53,243 --> 00:15:56,538
- DON'T WORRY. YOU'RE SO AHEAD.

412
00:15:56,538 --> 00:15:57,957
- [clicks tongue, chuckles]

413
00:15:57,957 --> 00:16:00,417
narrator: HER ABILITY TO SEE, 
HOWEVER,

414
00:16:00,417 --> 00:16:02,586
WAS CURRENTLY PROVING 
A DISADVANTAGE,

415
00:16:02,586 --> 00:16:05,755
AS SHE COULDN'T REVEAL TO THE 
MAN SHE RECOGNIZED AS TOBIAS

416
00:16:05,755 --> 00:16:09,093
THAT SHE KNEW HE WAS THERE 
WITHOUT BETRAYING HER SECRET.

417
00:16:15,599 --> 00:16:16,808
AND TOBIAS WAS FINDING HER

418
00:16:16,808 --> 00:16:20,395
AN UNCANNILY DIFFICULT 
BLIND GIRL TO OUTMANEUVER.

419
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:32,324
THEIR GAME OF CAT AND MOUSE 
CONTINUED.

420
00:16:35,952 --> 00:16:38,913
UNTIL MICHAEL SHOWED UP 
TO RETURN JUSTICE.

421
00:16:38,913 --> 00:16:43,043
- OH, JUSTICE, WHAT IS IT, BOY? 
WHAT IS IT?

422
00:16:43,043 --> 00:16:46,963
IS THERE SOME JACKASS 
IN MY BATHROBE?

423
00:16:46,963 --> 00:16:50,259
[spraying] 
[both screaming]

424
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:53,012
- OH! I CAN'T SEE!

425
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:55,430
narrator: AND LATER, THE FAMILY 
GATHERED AT THE COURTHOUSE

426
00:16:55,430 --> 00:16:56,640
TO RESPOND TO THE PLEA OFFER.

427
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:58,017
- THEY DON'T HAVE A CASE 
AGAINST US.

428
00:16:58,017 --> 00:17:00,477
I TOOK CARE OF EVERYTHING.

429
00:17:00,477 --> 00:17:01,728
- SOMETHING SMELLS WONDERFUL.

430
00:17:01,728 --> 00:17:04,356
- WELL, THANK YOU.

431
00:17:04,356 --> 00:17:07,317
WOULD THAT I COULD SAY THAT 
I WORE IT TO IMPRESS YOU,

432
00:17:07,317 --> 00:17:09,194
BUT, NO, I'M AFRAID IT'S 
MERELY A CLOAKING AGENT

433
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:12,822
FROM A SADLY BLUNDEROUS 
AFTERNOON.

434
00:17:12,822 --> 00:17:16,035
- WHO ELSE HAVE WE GOT? 
WHAT ABOUT BUSTER?

435
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:19,996
WORST-CASE SCENARIO 
HE GETS CAUGHT, NO MORE BUSTER.

436
00:17:19,996 --> 00:17:21,248
- I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

437
00:17:21,248 --> 00:17:22,916
YOU'RE THE ONE 
WHO'S STAYING PUT.

438
00:17:22,916 --> 00:17:25,669
NOT ME. YOU.

439
00:17:25,669 --> 00:17:26,920
- WHAT'S GOTTEN INTO YOU?

440
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:29,298
HAVE YOU BEEN EATING CHEESE?

441
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:32,967
narrator: 
OUTSIDE THE COURTHOUSE,

442
00:17:32,967 --> 00:17:35,470
SURELY FUNKE 
WAS ADDRESSING THE CROWD.

443
00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:37,556
GEORGE MICHAEL PREPARED TO 
CONFRONT HER ABOUT IT.

444
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:41,143
- NOT JUST TO ME, BUT TO ALL 
HANDICAPPED KIDS OUT THERE

445
00:17:41,143 --> 00:17:42,394
WHO ARE SICK AND TIRED

446
00:17:42,394 --> 00:17:45,439
OF SITTING IN THE FRONT ROWS 
AT BASKETBALL GAMES.

447
00:17:45,439 --> 00:17:47,274
narrator: GEORGE MICHAEL SPOTTED 
HIS FATHER,

448
00:17:47,274 --> 00:17:49,693
AND NOT WANTING TO APPEAR 
TO BE ABUSING THE LEGAL SYSTEM,

449
00:17:49,693 --> 00:17:52,028
FOUND A PLACE TO HIDE.

450
00:17:52,028 --> 00:17:54,739
MICHAEL, DETERMINED TO 
EXPOSE MAGGIE,

451
00:17:54,739 --> 00:17:57,659
HID TO AVOID 
TIPPING HIS HAND.

452
00:17:57,659 --> 00:17:59,953
IT WAS THEN, HOWEVER,

453
00:17:59,953 --> 00:18:02,581
THAT LINDSAY'S ADVOCACY GROUP 
HAD THEIR BIG MOMENT.

454
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:08,128
- HEY, GEORGE MICHAEL, 
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

455
00:18:08,128 --> 00:18:10,004
- I JUST THOUGHT I'D COME DOWN 
AND SEE THE FAMILY.

456
00:18:10,004 --> 00:18:11,715
SEE EVERYONE.

457
00:18:11,715 --> 00:18:13,467
- OH. 
- THAT'S WHY I'M HERE.

458
00:18:13,467 --> 00:18:14,926
- WELL, PAL, YOU DON'T 
NEED TO DO THAT.

459
00:18:14,926 --> 00:18:16,095
YOU CAN HEAD ON HOME.

460
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:18,263
WHY DON'T YOU GO HELP THAT 
HANDICAPPED FRIEND OF YOURS?

461
00:18:18,263 --> 00:18:20,014
- SHE KIND OF LIED TO ME.

462
00:18:20,014 --> 00:18:21,683
- I WAS RECENTLY 
LIED TO MYSELF.

463
00:18:21,683 --> 00:18:23,310
AND FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH, 
GEORGE MICHAEL,

464
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:25,187
YOU CANNOT LET PEOPLE 
GET AWAY WITH THAT.

465
00:18:25,187 --> 00:18:27,481
- IT'S JUST SO HARD TO KNOW WHAT 
THE RIGHT THING TO DO IS.

466
00:18:27,481 --> 00:18:30,525
- I KNOW IT. IT'S NOT LIKE 
THERE'S SOME LIST OF RULES

467
00:18:30,525 --> 00:18:32,236
HANDED DOWN TO US 
FROM ON HIGH.

468
00:18:32,236 --> 00:18:34,196
- NO. 
- WATCH YOUR HEAD.

469
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:40,577
[loud crash] 
[car alarm blaring]

470
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:45,915
narrator: SO MICHAEL SET OUT TO 
EXPOSE IN COURT

471
00:18:45,915 --> 00:18:48,418
THAT MAGGIE 
WASN'T REALLY BLIND.

472
00:18:48,418 --> 00:18:50,044
- SHE'S RIGHT THERE. 
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?

473
00:18:50,044 --> 00:18:51,546
- I GOT A PLAN. 
- THANK GOD.

474
00:18:51,546 --> 00:18:52,797
- YOUR HONOR, THE PURPOSE

475
00:18:52,797 --> 00:18:54,966
OF A COURT OF LAW 
IS TO FIND THE TRUTH,

476
00:18:54,966 --> 00:18:58,178
WHICH IS WHY WITNESSES 
SWEAR ON THIS.

477
00:18:58,178 --> 00:19:00,305
AFTER ALL, THEY SAY 
JUSTICE IS BLIND.

478
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:04,768
SURELY, SHE HAS ENOUGH SIGHT 
TO CATCH THE TRUTH

479
00:19:04,768 --> 00:19:07,687
BEFORE IT HITS HER 
IN THE FACE.

480
00:19:07,687 --> 00:19:10,190
- OBJECTION, YOUR-- 
- [all gasp]

481
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:11,441
narrator: UNFORTUNATELY,

482
00:19:11,441 --> 00:19:13,735
MAGGIE HAD BEEN 
TEMPORARILY BLINDED THAT DAY.

483
00:19:13,735 --> 00:19:15,111
- I CAN'T SEE!

484
00:19:15,111 --> 00:19:16,571
- BAILIFF!

485
00:19:16,571 --> 00:19:18,490
- THAT WAS MY PLAN. 
WHAT DO YOU GOT?

486
00:19:20,825 --> 00:19:22,994
narrator: SO GEORGE MICHAEL 
DECIDED TO ONCE AND FOR ALL

487
00:19:22,994 --> 00:19:24,371
PUT AN END TO SURELY FUNKE.

488
00:19:24,371 --> 00:19:25,622
- I NEED TO TALK TO YOU.

489
00:19:25,622 --> 00:19:27,249
- AND THIS IS THE MAN 
WHO INSPIRED ME.

490
00:19:27,249 --> 00:19:28,500
GEORGE MICHAEL BLUTH.

491
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:31,336
[scattered applause]

492
00:19:31,336 --> 00:19:32,587
HE IS THE ONE WHO IS 
RESPONSIBLE

493
00:19:32,587 --> 00:19:34,214
FOR THE NEW RAMPS 
AT OUR SCHOOL.

494
00:19:34,214 --> 00:19:39,844
AND HE WILL CARRY ON MY LEGACY 
AND PUT AN END TO B.S.

495
00:19:44,474 --> 00:19:45,725
- SURELY CAN BEAT THIS THING.

496
00:19:45,725 --> 00:19:49,979
[together] 
NO MORE B.S. NO MORE B.S.

497
00:19:49,979 --> 00:19:51,898
narrator: AND MICHAEL 
REUNITED WITH MAGGIE,

498
00:19:51,898 --> 00:19:53,650
WHO HAD BEEN KICKED 
OFF THE CASE.

499
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:55,569
- I REALLY THOUGHT 
YOU WERE LYING TO ME.

500
00:19:55,569 --> 00:19:56,778
I AM SO SORRY.

501
00:19:56,778 --> 00:19:59,072
- MICHAEL, I'VE BEEN DOING 
THIS BLIND ACT THING FOR YEARS.

502
00:19:59,072 --> 00:20:00,699
IT'S WACKED.

503
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:02,534
- ARE YOU GOING TO ADMIT 
THAT YOU WERE FAKING IT?

504
00:20:02,534 --> 00:20:04,411
- I THINK I'M GONNA GO FOR

505
00:20:04,411 --> 00:20:08,457
"I WAS STRUCK BY THE BIBLE 
AND IT RESTORED MY SIGHT."

506
00:20:08,457 --> 00:20:09,916
[laughs]

507
00:20:09,916 --> 00:20:12,168
SO WHAT ABOUT US?

508
00:20:12,168 --> 00:20:15,255
WE WERE STARTING TO 
ESTABLISH SOME TRUST

509
00:20:15,255 --> 00:20:17,299
EXCEPT FOR ALL THE LIES.

510
00:20:17,299 --> 00:20:19,301
- YOU KNOW, I WAS ORIGINALLY 
LOOKING FOR SOMETHING

511
00:20:19,301 --> 00:20:21,428
COMPLETELY UNCOMPLICATED. 
- YEAH. ME TOO.

512
00:20:21,428 --> 00:20:23,347
FORGET IT. 
THIS IS SO OVER.

513
00:20:23,347 --> 00:20:24,723
- YOU KNOW, WE'RE SAYING 
GOOD-BYE,

514
00:20:24,723 --> 00:20:26,475
AND THIS IS 
ACTUALLY THE FIRST TIME

515
00:20:26,475 --> 00:20:28,768
THAT I FEEL THAT YOU CAN 
REALLY SEE ME.

516
00:20:28,768 --> 00:20:31,438
- YEAH.

517
00:20:31,438 --> 00:20:35,525
WE'RE JUST TWO PEOPLE 
STARING AT EACH OTHER

518
00:20:35,525 --> 00:20:39,238
FULLY EXPOSED 
IN A COURT OF LAW.

519
00:20:44,451 --> 00:20:48,330
- [singing] HEY, 
IT'S A BEAUTIFUL MORNING

520
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:51,207
I WAKE UP 
AND LOOK AROUND

521
00:20:53,918 --> 00:20:56,087
- JUSTICE! 
[whistles]

522
00:20:56,087 --> 00:20:57,130
smash!

523
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:59,799
narrator: ON THE NEXT 
"ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT."

524
00:20:59,799 --> 00:21:03,303
BARRY GETS A SIGN 
FROM GOD.

525
00:21:03,303 --> 00:21:06,265
- I WILL OBEY YOUR WILL. 
I WILL LEAD A GOOD LIFE.

526
00:21:08,475 --> 00:21:10,560
WELL, THE HELL 
WITH THIS THEN!

527
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:11,853
narrator: AND MAGGIE IS REPLACED

528
00:21:11,853 --> 00:21:13,938
WITH A NEW, LESS GENEROUS, 
PROSECUTOR.

529
00:21:13,938 --> 00:21:14,981
- I WAS MADE TO UNDERSTAND

530
00:21:14,981 --> 00:21:16,775
THERE WERE GRILLED CHEESE 
SANDWICHES HERE.5
