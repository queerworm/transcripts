OF A WEALTHY FAMILY

WHO LOST EVERYTHING 
AND THE ONE SON

00:00:05,213 --> 00:00:07,840
WHO HAD NO CHOICE 
BUT TO KEEP THEM ALL TOGETHER.

4
00:00:13,638 --> 00:00:15,556
IT'S "ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT."

5
00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:19,269
BEFORE GOING TO WORK,

6
00:00:19,269 --> 00:00:21,521
MICHAEL DECIDED 
TO HAVE A LITTLE FUN.

7
00:00:21,521 --> 00:00:23,564
- I'M DOING A LITTLE 
COST-PROJECTION ANALYSIS

8
00:00:23,564 --> 00:00:24,690
FOR A MINI-MALL.

9
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:25,775
- WOW.

10
00:00:25,775 --> 00:00:28,028
IT'S PRETTY COOL YOU KNOW HOW 
TO DO ALL THAT STUFF.

11
00:00:28,028 --> 00:00:29,904
- YEAH, WELL, 
MAYBE YOUR OLD MAN

12
00:00:29,904 --> 00:00:33,783
IS JUST A LITTLE BIT COOLER 
THAN YOU THOUGHT HE WAS.

13
00:00:33,783 --> 00:00:38,079
STUPID. STUPID CHAIR. 
VERY STUPID CHAIR.

14
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:41,957
BUT IT'S ALSO THIS STUPID 
MODEL HOME FURNITURE.

15
00:00:41,957 --> 00:00:43,376
MAYBE I OUGHTA GET MYSELF

16
00:00:43,376 --> 00:00:45,295
ONE OF THOSE 
NICE LEATHER CHAIRS FROM WORK.

17
00:00:45,295 --> 00:00:47,297
- PEOPLE CAN TAKE 
CHAIRS HOME FROM WORK?

18
00:00:47,297 --> 00:00:48,423
- WELL, NOT EVERYBODY.

19
00:00:48,423 --> 00:00:50,591
BUT I'M THE PRESIDENT 
OF THE BLUTH COMPANY

20
00:00:50,591 --> 00:00:51,634
SINCE DAD'S IN JAIL.

21
00:00:51,634 --> 00:00:54,804
IT'S OKAY IF I TAKE A LITTLE 
SOMETHING FROM WORK, YOU KNOW?

22
00:00:54,804 --> 00:00:56,514
- YEAH, BUT ISN'T THAT 
WHY GRANDPA'S IN JAIL,

23
00:00:56,514 --> 00:00:58,599
BECAUSE 
HE TOOK THINGS FROM WORK?

24
00:00:58,599 --> 00:01:01,561
- YOU'RE A GOOD KID, 
YOU KNOW THAT?

25
00:01:01,561 --> 00:01:03,813
- I MEAN, A CHAIR COSTS MONEY, 
SO IT'S LIKE STEALING,

26
00:01:03,813 --> 00:01:04,897
AND YOU ALWAYS SAY--

27
00:01:04,897 --> 00:01:06,691
- NOT STEALING. NOT.

28
00:01:06,691 --> 00:01:08,734
OKAY, I'M THE ONE 
THAT TAUGHT YOU

29
00:01:08,734 --> 00:01:11,196
THAT STEALING IS BAD, 
ALL RIGHT?

30
00:01:11,196 --> 00:01:14,490
I'M JUST SAYING, YOU KNOW, 
IF I GOT A LEATHER CHAIR, OKAY?

31
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:16,784
AND I GET TO LEAN BACK-- 
OH, THIS ONE'S GONNA GO.

32
00:01:16,784 --> 00:01:17,910
thump!

33
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:19,204
[groans]

34
00:01:19,204 --> 00:01:20,663
- LEATHER CHAIR?

35
00:01:20,663 --> 00:01:21,956
SO YOU'RE AGAINST STEALING,

36
00:01:21,956 --> 00:01:24,167
BUT SKINNING COWS 
IS COOL WITH YOU.

37
00:01:24,167 --> 00:01:26,169
- I'M FINE, BY THE WAY.

38
00:01:26,169 --> 00:01:28,629
FRANKLY, YOUR CONCERN 
IS GETTING EMBARRASSING.

39
00:01:28,629 --> 00:01:30,840
- SINCE WHEN ARE YOU 
AGAINST LEATHER?

40
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:33,008
- YEAH, YOU'RE NOT EVEN 
A VEGETARIAN.

41
00:01:33,008 --> 00:01:35,386
- I'M NOT AGAINST THE INSIDES. 
PEOPLE NEED MEAT TO SURVIVE.

42
00:01:35,386 --> 00:01:37,096
- YOU ARE AWARE 
THAT THEY DON'T

43
00:01:37,096 --> 00:01:38,556
REMOVE IT 
FROM THE COW SURGICALLY, RIGHT?

44
00:01:38,556 --> 00:01:41,267
[doorbell rings]

45
00:01:41,267 --> 00:01:42,685
- HI, MICHAEL.

46
00:01:42,685 --> 00:01:45,605
- MARTA, HI. 
HEY, IT'S MARTA.

47
00:01:45,605 --> 00:01:49,609
HEY, IT'S MARTA, EVERYBODY. 
GREAT TO SEE YOU.

48
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:50,776
- I WAS JUST 
LOOKING FOR GOB.

49
00:01:50,776 --> 00:01:52,320
- WELL, 
YOU'RE HIS GIRLFRIEND.

50
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,822
- narrator: MICHAEL WISHED MARTA 
WAS HIS GIRLFRIEND,

51
00:01:54,822 --> 00:01:57,242
A SECRET HE HAD 
ONLY SHARED WITH LINDSAY.

52
00:01:57,242 --> 00:01:58,951
- ACTUALLY, WE HAD A BIG FIGHT.

53
00:01:58,951 --> 00:02:00,453
HE THOUGHT I WAS 
BELITTLING HIS CAREER,

54
00:02:00,453 --> 00:02:01,912
BUT I NEVER WOULD DO THAT.

55
00:02:01,912 --> 00:02:04,415
- NEITHER WOULD I. 
WHAT CAREER?

56
00:02:04,415 --> 00:02:05,625
- THE MAGIC?

57
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:07,293
- OH, THE TRICKS, 
THE LITTLE TRICKS.

58
00:02:07,293 --> 00:02:08,753
THOSE ARE GREAT.

59
00:02:08,753 --> 00:02:11,422
- WELL, HE DIDN'T LIKE 
MY REACTION TO HIS NEW ONE.

60
00:02:11,422 --> 00:02:14,259
- REAL NEEDLE. REAL APPLE.

61
00:02:14,259 --> 00:02:16,511
REAL NECK.

62
00:02:20,306 --> 00:02:21,891
- AH, EL ES ZOMBI!

63
00:02:21,891 --> 00:02:24,101
[screaming]

64
00:02:24,101 --> 00:02:26,646
- THEY'RE CHILDREN! 
HOW COULD YOU DO THAT?

65
00:02:26,646 --> 00:02:27,688
- OH, SURE.

66
00:02:27,688 --> 00:02:28,939
FIRST YOU DUMP ALL OVER IT.

67
00:02:28,939 --> 00:02:30,525
NOW YOU WANT TO KNOW 
HOW IT'S DONE.

68
00:02:30,525 --> 00:02:32,193
- AND I WANTED TO APOLOGIZE.

69
00:02:32,193 --> 00:02:33,278
- WELL, HE HASN'T 
BEEN HERE.

70
00:02:33,278 --> 00:02:35,655
- BUT HE SAID 
HE WAS STAYING HERE.

71
00:02:35,655 --> 00:02:37,114
OH, MY GOD.

72
00:02:37,114 --> 00:02:38,491
MAYBE HE'S STAYING 
WITH ANOTHER WOMAN.

73
00:02:38,491 --> 00:02:39,575
- NO, NO, NO. NO, NO, NO.

74
00:02:39,575 --> 00:02:41,661
NO, HE IS STAYING HERE.

75
00:02:41,661 --> 00:02:45,748
I JUST HAVEN'T SEEN HIM HERE, 
THE FOYER OR THE KITCHEN.

76
00:02:45,748 --> 00:02:49,043
- WELL, THAT'S A RELIEF. 
- YEAH.

77
00:02:49,043 --> 00:02:50,711
- WELL, TELL HIM 
TO CALL ME WHEN HE GETS IN.

78
00:02:50,711 --> 00:02:52,297
- I SURE WILL, MARTA.

79
00:02:52,297 --> 00:02:55,007
- IF YOU REMEMBER. 
- I WILL REMEMBER.

80
00:02:55,007 --> 00:02:58,344
YEAH. I'LL GIVE HIM 
THE MESSAGE THOUGH. OKAY.

81
00:02:58,344 --> 00:02:59,762
- SHE'S GONE. 
- YEP. GOT IT.

82
00:02:59,762 --> 00:03:01,597
- YOU ARE TOO NICE.

83
00:03:01,597 --> 00:03:03,057
- OH, COME ON. 
WHAT WAS I SUPPOSED TO DO?

84
00:03:03,057 --> 00:03:04,809
TELL HER THAT GOB 
IS NOT STAYING HERE?

85
00:03:04,809 --> 00:03:06,561
TELL HER GOB 
IS SCREWING AROUND ON HER?

86
00:03:06,561 --> 00:03:08,103
GOD KNOWS WHERE HE IS?

87
00:03:08,103 --> 00:03:10,523
ACTUALLY, 
THAT-THAT SOUNDED OKAY.

88
00:03:10,523 --> 00:03:11,899
- NAH, YOU'LL NEVER 
BE ABLE TO DO IT.

89
00:03:11,899 --> 00:03:12,942
YOU'RE TOO GOOD.

90
00:03:12,942 --> 00:03:14,444
YOU'RE THE NOBLE ONE. 
- THANK YOU.

91
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:15,695
- THE ONE WHO NEVER WINS.

92
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:16,862
- I-I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT.

93
00:03:16,862 --> 00:03:18,281
- THE LOSER. 
- HMM?

94
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:19,657
- THE FOOL.

95
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:24,329
- SHE IS SUCH A HYPOCRITE. 
DOESN'T IT DRIVE YOU NUTS?

96
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:26,331
- CRAZY. WAIT. 
WHO IS? WHICH PART?

97
00:03:26,331 --> 00:03:27,707
- MY MOM.

98
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:29,834
SHE PRETENDS TO CARE 
ABOUT ALL THESE CAUSES.

99
00:03:29,834 --> 00:03:31,877
- narrator: LINDSAY HAD ALWAYS 
BEEN CELEBRATED

100
00:03:31,877 --> 00:03:35,465
FOR HER WINE AND CHEESE 
CHARITY FUND-RAISERS.

101
00:03:39,677 --> 00:03:41,136
- I MEAN, 
NOW SHE'S ANTI-LEATHER?

102
00:03:41,136 --> 00:03:44,640
LET'S SEE HOW SHE FEELS 
WHEN HER DAUGHTER'S PRO-LEATHER.

103
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,058
WANNA GO SHOPPING WITH ME?

104
00:03:46,058 --> 00:03:47,435
I BET YOU COULD 
GET SOMETHING COOL.

105
00:03:47,435 --> 00:03:49,729
- narrator: IN FACT, 
GEORGE MICHAEL

106
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:51,105
HAD BEEN TRYING 
TO PROVE TO MAEBY

107
00:03:51,105 --> 00:03:52,523
THAT HE WAS MACHO,

108
00:03:52,523 --> 00:03:54,650
AFTER AN EMBARRASSING 
BRUSH WITH HER.

109
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:56,527
- YOUR LEGS 
LOOK EXACTLY LIKE MINE,

110
00:03:56,527 --> 00:03:58,153
AND I JUST SHAVED MINE.

111
00:03:58,153 --> 00:04:01,741
- SO I'M THINKING OF 
GETTING A MOTORCYCLE.

112
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:03,409
YEAH, I'M GONNA NEED 
A LEATHER JACKET

113
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:04,744
FOR WHEN I'M ON MY HOG 
AND NEED TO GO INTO

114
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:05,786
A CONTROLLED SLIDE.

115
00:04:05,786 --> 00:04:07,913
- THERE'S MY LITTLE GIRL.

116
00:04:07,913 --> 00:04:11,459
I'VE GOT GREAT NEWS. 
DADDY HAS THE ENTIRE DAY OFF.

117
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:13,919
- BUT YOU HAVE EVERY DAY OFF. 
YOU DON'T HAVE A JOB.

118
00:04:13,919 --> 00:04:16,756
- WELL--I DON'T NEED MONEY 
TO HANG OUT WITH MY DAUGHTER.

119
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:17,757
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

120
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:18,799
- WE'RE GOING SHOPPING.

121
00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:20,718
- OH, NO, NO. 
I CAN'T DO THAT.

122
00:04:20,718 --> 00:04:22,303
- narrator: 
THE NEXT DAY,

123
00:04:22,303 --> 00:04:23,721
MICHAEL WAS STOPPED 
ON HIS WAY TO WORK.

124
00:04:23,721 --> 00:04:25,806
- GET IN. 
- WHAT?

125
00:04:25,806 --> 00:04:27,808
- IF YOU CARE 
ABOUT YOUR BROTHER,

126
00:04:27,808 --> 00:04:30,395
YOU'LL GET IN THIS CAR.

127
00:04:30,395 --> 00:04:32,855
- WHICH BROTHER? 
- GOB.

128
00:04:43,574 --> 00:04:45,200
LET ME BE CLEARER.

129
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:49,121
TELL HIM ROLLO WANTS HIM 
TO SAY GOOD-BYE TO HIS LEGS.

130
00:05:02,677 --> 00:05:03,719
[knocking]

131
00:05:03,719 --> 00:05:05,220
- narrator: 
MICHAEL WENT LOOKING FOR GOB.

132
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:06,221
- MOM.

133
00:05:06,221 --> 00:05:08,015
- I'M SO GLAD YOU'RE HERE.

134
00:05:08,015 --> 00:05:10,267
I WANT YOU TO HELP ME BREAK UP 
YOUR BROTHER AND HIS GIRLFRIEND.

135
00:05:10,267 --> 00:05:12,562
WELL, I'M ALL FOR THAT. 
WE'VE JUST GOTTA FIND HIM FIRST.

136
00:05:12,562 --> 00:05:13,771
- HE'S LOCKED ON THE BALCONY.

137
00:05:13,771 --> 00:05:17,274
- OH. 
YOU MEANT BUSTER.

138
00:05:17,274 --> 00:05:18,776
I THOUGHT YOU WERE 
TALKING ABOUT GOB.

139
00:05:18,776 --> 00:05:21,028
- NO. I WILL NOT HAVE BUSTER 
DATING MY BEST FRIEND.

140
00:05:21,028 --> 00:05:22,947
- narrator: 
TENSION HAD BEEN HIGH

141
00:05:22,947 --> 00:05:24,865
BETWEEN THE TWO LUCILLES

142
00:05:24,865 --> 00:05:27,201
SINCE BUSTER HAD ANNOUNCED 
HE'D BEEN DATING HER.

143
00:05:27,201 --> 00:05:29,370
ALTHOUGH NEITHER 
HAD ADDRESSED THIS,

144
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:31,706
BOTH HAD GIVEN INDICATIONS 
OF THEIR TRUE FEELINGS.

145
00:05:31,706 --> 00:05:33,583
- MOM, YOU'RE RUINING OUR FORT.

146
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:35,876
- I MEAN, SHE'S BEEN 
A FAMILY FRIEND FOR YEARS.

147
00:05:35,876 --> 00:05:38,838
IT'S JUST...CREEPY.

148
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:39,880
HI, BUDDY.

149
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:42,341
MOM, I THINK 
YOU MIGHT BE OVERREACTING.

150
00:05:42,341 --> 00:05:44,677
- SHE CHANGED HIM 
AS A BABY.

151
00:05:44,677 --> 00:05:46,804
- OKAY. THAT-THAT'S 
ABOUT THE CREEPIEST THING

152
00:05:46,804 --> 00:05:48,723
I'VE EVER HEARD.

153
00:05:48,723 --> 00:05:50,391
- THAT'S WHY 
SHE DIDN'T LOOK SURPRISED.

154
00:05:50,391 --> 00:05:52,685
- YOU'RE THE ONLY CHILD 
WHO CHOSE A SPOUSE I LIKED,

155
00:05:52,685 --> 00:05:54,353
AND SHE'S THE ONE 
WHO HAD TO DIE.

156
00:05:54,353 --> 00:05:56,063
- I KNOW. 
THAT'S ROUGH FOR YOU.

157
00:05:56,063 --> 00:05:57,773
MOM, I'M LOOKING FOR GOB.

158
00:05:57,773 --> 00:05:59,024
THERE'S 
SOME PEOPLE AFTER HIM,

159
00:05:59,024 --> 00:06:01,652
AND I DON'T KNOW 
WHETHER IT'S GAMBLING OR WHAT,

160
00:06:01,652 --> 00:06:04,113
BUT, UM, 
THEY WANNA BREAK HIS LEGS.

161
00:06:04,113 --> 00:06:05,490
- IT'S A GOOD THING 
HE'S ALREADY GOT

162
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:06,699
THAT LITTLE SCOOTER.

163
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:08,325
[laughs]

164
00:06:08,325 --> 00:06:09,994
OH, DON'T GIVE ME 
THAT LOOK.

165
00:06:09,994 --> 00:06:13,581
I HAPPEN TO BE 
A MORE CARING MOTHER THAN MOST.

166
00:06:13,581 --> 00:06:16,291
- WHERE'S MY BED? 
- I PUT IT IN STORAGE.

167
00:06:16,291 --> 00:06:17,668
I GUESS YOU'LL JUST 
HAVE TO DECIDE

168
00:06:17,668 --> 00:06:20,129
WHICH LUCILLE YOU WANT TO 
SPEND YOUR NIGHTS WITH.

169
00:06:20,129 --> 00:06:22,006
- OKAY, BEFORE 
I LEAVE THIS PLACE

170
00:06:22,006 --> 00:06:25,384
FOR THE LAST TIME EVER, 
HAS ANYONE SEEN GOB?

171
00:06:25,384 --> 00:06:29,096
- I SAW HIM LAST NIGHT 
AT THE PLAYTIME PIZZA THEATER,

172
00:06:29,096 --> 00:06:30,180
ON MY DATE.

173
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:32,808
OF WHICH I HAVE 
ANOTHER ONE TONIGHT.

174
00:06:32,808 --> 00:06:35,269
AND I'M GOING TO 
CONTINUE DATING, MOM.

175
00:06:35,269 --> 00:06:38,147
- SOUNDS A LITTLE BIT LIKE 
"DATING MOM."

176
00:06:38,147 --> 00:06:39,607
- IT'S STARTING TO FEEL 
A LITTLE LIKE IT.

177
00:06:39,607 --> 00:06:41,776
- HMM.

178
00:06:41,776 --> 00:06:43,444
- narrator: 
LUCILLE DECIDED

179
00:06:43,444 --> 00:06:45,530
SHE NEEDED 
THE HELP OF BUSTER'S FATHER.

180
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:47,907
UNFORTUNATELY, 
AFTER A RECENT ESCAPE ATTEMPT,

181
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:52,870
GEORGE SR. HAD BEEN 
PUT IN SOLITARY CONFINEMENT.

182
00:07:18,521 --> 00:07:21,441
MICHAEL WENT TO FIND HIS BROTHER 
AT HIS LATEST GIG.

183
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:22,483
- WHAT'S UP, MIKE?

184
00:07:22,483 --> 00:07:23,693
- YEAH. WHAT ARE YOU 
DOING HERE?

185
00:07:23,693 --> 00:07:25,402
- CAN'T GET ANY WORK, MIKE.

186
00:07:25,402 --> 00:07:26,862
MAGICIANS' ALLIANCE 
HAS BLACKBALLED ME

187
00:07:26,862 --> 00:07:27,863
FROM EVERY VENUE IN TOWN.

188
00:07:27,863 --> 00:07:28,864
- HMM.

189
00:07:28,864 --> 00:07:30,491
- EVEN MY OWN 
SO- CALLED GIRLFRIEND

190
00:07:30,491 --> 00:07:31,534
DOESN'T BELIEVE IN ME.

191
00:07:31,534 --> 00:07:33,744
- WELL, I DON'T WANNA GET INTO 
THAT PART OF YOUR LIFE ANYMORE.

192
00:07:33,744 --> 00:07:35,370
OKAY, LISTEN, 
I JUST CAME HERE TO TELL YOU

193
00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:37,122
THAT THIS GUY NAMED ROLLO

194
00:07:37,122 --> 00:07:38,916
PULLED ME OVER 
AND MADE SOME THREATS.

195
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:40,292
- WHAT KIND OF THREATS?

196
00:07:40,292 --> 00:07:41,544
HE SAID TO SAY GOOD-BYE 
TO YOUR LEGS.

197
00:07:41,544 --> 00:07:43,128
I DON'T KNOW WHETHER 
THIS GUY'S A MOBSTER,

198
00:07:43,128 --> 00:07:45,590
A LOAN SHARK, 
SOMETHING EQUALLY SCARY.

199
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:46,632
- MAGICIAN.

200
00:07:46,632 --> 00:07:49,426
- I THINK YOU'RE CONFUSING SCARY 
WITH SILLY.

201
00:07:49,426 --> 00:07:51,053
THIS GUY WAS FRIGHTENING. 
HE WAS IN A LIMO.

202
00:07:51,053 --> 00:07:54,849
- NO, HE'S A MAGICIAN. 
HE REPLACED ME IN THE ALLIANCE.

203
00:07:54,849 --> 00:07:57,392
HE'S THE REASON I GOTTA 
DO MY ACT IN THIS HELLHOLE.

204
00:07:57,392 --> 00:07:58,769
- WHY DOES HE WANNA 
BREAK YOUR LEGS?

205
00:07:58,769 --> 00:07:59,937
- HE DOESN'T WANT TO 
BREAK MY LEGS.

206
00:07:59,937 --> 00:08:02,022
HE WANTS TO TAKE MY LEGS. 
- I-I DON'T--

207
00:08:02,022 --> 00:08:05,568
- THE LEGS, THE BOTTOM HALF OF 
MY SAW-THE-LADY-IN-HALF TRICK.

208
00:08:05,568 --> 00:08:06,944
NO, NOT NOW.

209
00:08:06,944 --> 00:08:08,195
I'M SHOWING HIM 
HOW TO DO THE TRICK.

210
00:08:08,195 --> 00:08:09,572
TWO CHICKS CURL UP IN A BOX.

211
00:08:09,572 --> 00:08:11,491
WE CALL ONE THE HEAD 
AND ONE THE LEGS.

212
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:12,867
- SO THAT'S HOW THEY DO IT.

213
00:08:12,867 --> 00:08:15,035
- GOD, I GOTTA STOP 
GIVING THESE THINGS AWAY.

214
00:08:15,035 --> 00:08:16,954
- THE TOP HALF THERE, 
WHAT DO YOU DO ABOUT THAT?

215
00:08:16,954 --> 00:08:18,455
- I JUST GET A VOLUNTEER 
FROM THE CROWD.

216
00:08:18,455 --> 00:08:19,665
- OH, YEAH?

217
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:21,416
- THE OLD TOP HALF QUIT 
WHEN SHE FOUND OUT

218
00:08:21,416 --> 00:08:22,502
I WAS SLEEPING WITH THE LEGS.

219
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:25,212
- I GUESS WORD 
REALLY GETS AROUND IN THERE.

220
00:08:25,212 --> 00:08:26,672
SO ROLLO WANTS YOUR LEGS,

221
00:08:26,672 --> 00:08:28,215
BUT YOU'RE CHEATING ON MARTA 
WITH THOSE LEGS.

222
00:08:28,215 --> 00:08:29,424
- WOULD YOU GIVE ME 
A BREAK, PLEASE?

223
00:08:29,424 --> 00:08:31,135
THE LEGS ARE INSANELY JEALOUS.

224
00:08:31,135 --> 00:08:33,262
- IS THAT WHY YOU HAVEN'T SEEN 
MARTA FOR THE PAST FEW DAYS?

225
00:08:33,262 --> 00:08:35,014
THIS IS ALL ABOUT 
YOUR LOVE LIFE AGAIN, ISN'T IT?

226
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:36,390
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT. 
JUST FORGET IT.

227
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:37,975
I CAME HERE 
TO TRY TO HELP YOU.

228
00:08:37,975 --> 00:08:43,564
- HEY, I APPRECIATE YOUR TIME. 
- GREAT. GREAT.

229
00:08:43,564 --> 00:08:44,899
YOU KNOW WHAT, GOB?

230
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:47,067
MARTA IS A 
ONCE-IN-A-LIFETIME WOMAN.

231
00:08:47,067 --> 00:08:48,110
SHE'S A TREASURE.

232
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:49,361
AND I DON'T THINK 
YOU'RE SHOWING HER

233
00:08:49,361 --> 00:08:50,988
ENOUGH RESPECT, OKAY?

234
00:08:50,988 --> 00:08:55,325
- SHE DOESN'T RESPECT 
MY CAREER.

235
00:08:55,325 --> 00:08:58,078
- OKAY.

236
00:08:58,078 --> 00:09:00,665
- HE'S HAVING SEX 
WITH A WOMAN IN HIS ACT?

237
00:09:00,665 --> 00:09:02,249
- I GOTTA TELL MARTA 
WHAT'S GOING ON.

238
00:09:02,249 --> 00:09:04,043
- FIRST OF ALL, 
SHE'LL HATE YOU FOR IT.

239
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:05,670
IT'S CALLED SHOOT THE MESSENGER.

240
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:07,379
SECONDLY, 
IT'S NOT IN YOUR NATURE.

241
00:09:07,379 --> 00:09:09,089
I MEAN, 
YOU'RE LIKE MR. MORALS.

242
00:09:09,089 --> 00:09:10,424
YOU CAN'T EVEN 
TAKE A DESK CHAIR.

243
00:09:10,424 --> 00:09:11,466
- DAMN IT.

244
00:09:11,466 --> 00:09:12,509
I-I'M A SAINT, YOU KNOW?

245
00:09:12,509 --> 00:09:14,511
I'M A LIVING SAINT,

246
00:09:14,511 --> 00:09:16,346
AND I GET 
ABSOLUTELY NOTHING OUT OF IT.

247
00:09:16,346 --> 00:09:19,141
- WELL, YOU GET A FALSE FEELING 
OF SUPERIORITY.

248
00:09:19,141 --> 00:09:20,768
- I KNOW. 
THAT IS NICE, BUT THIS TIME,

249
00:09:20,768 --> 00:09:21,769
IT'S NOT ENOUGH.

250
00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:23,563
WHY DO I ALWAYS 
HAVE TO BE THE ONE

251
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:25,731
THAT HAS TO SET 
THE GOOD EXAMPLE FOR EVERYONE?

252
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:30,695
- HEY, GUYS. 
- OH, THAT'S WHY.

253
00:09:32,112 --> 00:09:35,532
- HEY, MOM. 
- HEY, HONEY.

254
00:09:35,532 --> 00:09:37,827
- MOO?

255
00:09:37,827 --> 00:09:40,746
- MMM. 
MOO, HONEY.

256
00:09:40,746 --> 00:09:44,541
- YOU HAVE TO BE SOME SORT OF 
SHE-HULK TO GET THIS.

257
00:09:44,541 --> 00:09:45,710
- YOU JUST GOTTA 
REALLY DIG.

258
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:47,837
- WELL, IT'S NOT-- 
ENJOY--

259
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:49,672
OH, MAEBY, GREAT NEWS.

260
00:09:49,672 --> 00:09:51,090
I GOT MY HANDS ON SOME MONEY.

261
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:56,220
I CAN'T SAY HOW OR WHEN-- 
OR WHERE MY WEDDING RING IS,

262
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:59,890
BUT MY PURSE OVERFLOWETH 
AS DO MY HIGH SPIRITS,

263
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:01,726
SO A-SHOPPING WE MUST GO.

264
00:10:01,726 --> 00:10:03,060
- DAD, WE ALREADY WENT.

265
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:05,062
THAT'S WHY WE'RE WEARING 
ALL THIS LEATHER.

266
00:10:05,062 --> 00:10:07,564
I'M REALLY INTO LEATHER.

267
00:10:07,564 --> 00:10:09,191
TELL MOM.

268
00:10:09,191 --> 00:10:11,611
- YES.

269
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:13,028
- IF YOU EVER NEED 
TO BORROW ANY MONEY OR--

270
00:10:13,028 --> 00:10:15,740
- NO. 
THANK YOU, NO.

271
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:18,033
- narrator: SO TOBIAS 
CHOSE TO PURSUE

272
00:10:18,033 --> 00:10:19,493
A COMMON INTEREST 
WITH HIS DAUGHTER.

273
00:10:19,493 --> 00:10:21,370
- MAY I HELP YOU? 
- I HOPE SO.

274
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:23,247
I'M LOOKING 
FOR SOMETHING THAT SAYS,

275
00:10:23,247 --> 00:10:26,250
"DAD LIKES LEATHER."

276
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:28,919
- SOMETHING THAT SAYS, 
"LEATHER DADDY?"

277
00:10:28,919 --> 00:10:30,337
- OH, IS THERE SUCH A THING?

278
00:10:30,337 --> 00:10:33,090
- narrator: LATER THAT DAY, 
MICHAEL GOT A SURPRISE VISIT.

279
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:34,925
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? 
- I WAS LOOKING FOR GOB.

280
00:10:34,925 --> 00:10:36,886
HE SAID HE WAS 
WORKING HERE TODAY.

281
00:10:36,886 --> 00:10:39,096
- OH, YES? 
PLEASE.

282
00:10:39,096 --> 00:10:41,306
HE SAID THAT, HUH? 
HE SAID THAT HE'S WORKING, HUH?

283
00:10:41,306 --> 00:10:42,474
WOW. HERE?

284
00:10:42,474 --> 00:10:44,434
WHAT ELSE DID HE SAY?

285
00:10:44,434 --> 00:10:46,603
DID HE TELL YOU 
THAT I GAVE HIM YOUR MESSAGE?

286
00:10:46,603 --> 00:10:48,981
NOT THAT I'M THE MESSENGER, 
YOU KNOW?

287
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:50,190
- HE TOLD ME.

288
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:51,358
- I DON'T KNOW 
WHAT YOU SAID TO HIM,

289
00:10:51,358 --> 00:10:53,068
BUT IT REALLY 
TURNED HIM AROUND.

290
00:10:53,068 --> 00:10:56,113
- HE SAID I WAS A TREASURE. 
- SHE'S A TREASURE.

291
00:10:56,113 --> 00:10:59,283
- AND A 
ONCE-IN-A-LIFETIME WOMAN.

292
00:10:59,283 --> 00:11:09,543
- MM-HMM. 
LISTEN, MARTA, GOB IS--A POET.

293
00:11:09,543 --> 00:11:11,336
- MM. 
- HE'S TOUCHED.

294
00:11:11,336 --> 00:11:13,005
I'M GONNA TELL HIM 
THAT YOU STOPPED BY,

295
00:11:13,005 --> 00:11:15,507
AND, UH, 
YOU HAVE A NICE DAY.

296
00:11:15,507 --> 00:11:16,591
- THANK YOU.

297
00:11:16,591 --> 00:11:19,219
YOU'RE SUCH A GOOD BROTHER. 
ALWAYS TRYING TO HELP HIM.

298
00:11:19,219 --> 00:11:22,222
OH, AND HE SHOWED ME 
THE WATCH YOU GAVE HIM.

299
00:11:22,222 --> 00:11:24,266
- THE WATCH?

300
00:11:24,266 --> 00:11:27,019
- I APPRECIATE YOUR TIME.

301
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:28,603
- narrator: AND SO, 
FOR THE FIRST TIME,

302
00:11:28,603 --> 00:11:30,355
MICHAEL SET A PLAN IN MOTION

303
00:11:30,355 --> 00:11:32,357
TO TAKE SOMETHING 
THAT DIDN'T BELONG TO HIM.

304
00:11:32,357 --> 00:11:34,693
- YOU KNOW, 
I WAS THINKING,

305
00:11:34,693 --> 00:11:38,197
I'D LIKE TO HELP YOU GUYS OUT 
ONE MORE TIME.

306
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:41,366
YOU KNOW WHAT YOU SHOULD DO? 
YOU SHOULD SURPRISE GOB ONSTAGE.

307
00:11:41,366 --> 00:11:43,243
I KNOW THAT HE'S LOOKING 
FOR A NEW ASSISTANT.

308
00:11:43,243 --> 00:11:44,453
- REALLY? 
- MM-HMM.

309
00:11:44,453 --> 00:11:45,746
- COULD YOU HELP ME 
WITH THAT?

310
00:11:45,746 --> 00:11:46,956
- YES.

311
00:11:46,956 --> 00:11:50,375
- YOU REALLY ARE 
A GOOD GUY, MICHAEL.

312
00:11:50,375 --> 00:11:55,297
- WELL, YOU CAN'T CHANGE 
WHO YOU ARE.

313
00:11:58,425 --> 00:12:02,096
- [singing] 
START SHOPPING BY FINGERS

314
00:12:02,096 --> 00:12:05,724
WE'RE LIVING IN 
YOUR WORLD NOW THIS TIME

315
00:12:09,812 --> 00:12:11,856
- narrator: MICHAEL WENT TO 
THE POPULAR MAGIC PARLOR,

316
00:12:11,856 --> 00:12:15,109
THE GOTHIC CASTLE, 
TO ASK A FAVOR OF ROLLO.

317
00:12:15,109 --> 00:12:17,402
I WAS WONDERING IF, UH--

318
00:12:17,402 --> 00:12:20,906
IF YOU WOULD 
GIVE MY BROTHER A SHOW?

319
00:12:20,906 --> 00:12:23,617
ONE MORE CHANCE TO GET BACK IN 
WITH THE ALLIANCE.

320
00:12:23,617 --> 00:12:25,077
THAT'S ALL I ASK.

321
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:27,496
AND--AND YOU WILL GET 
YOUR LEGS BACK.

322
00:12:27,496 --> 00:12:28,956
- HOW?

323
00:12:28,956 --> 00:12:32,584
- YOU'RE ASKING ME 
TO REVEAL MY TRICK?

324
00:12:32,584 --> 00:12:34,294
- narrator: SO MICHAEL 
WENT TO GIVE HIS BROTHER

325
00:12:34,294 --> 00:12:35,295
THE GOOD NEWS.

326
00:12:35,295 --> 00:12:36,839
- REALLY, TOMORROW NIGHT?

327
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:39,008
- YEAH. YOU JUST GOTTA MAKE SURE 
YOU DO THE SAWING IN HALF TRICK.

328
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:40,259
- I DON'T EVEN HAVE 
A TOP HALF.

329
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:41,260
- DON'T WORRY ABOUT THAT.

330
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:42,386
I GOT SOMEONE I WANT YOU TO USE.

331
00:12:42,386 --> 00:12:43,428
SHE'S PERFECT, A GREAT GIRL.

332
00:12:43,428 --> 00:12:44,721
YOU'RE ACTUALLY 
DOING ME A FAVOR.

333
00:12:44,721 --> 00:12:48,058
- HAS SHE GOT BIG CANS? 
- I'LL SEE YA THERE, GOB.

334
00:12:48,058 --> 00:12:49,684
- YOU'RE A GOOD BROTHER.

335
00:12:49,684 --> 00:12:51,520
- YOU'RE A HORRIBLE BROTHER, 
MICHAEL.

336
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:53,230
- PRETTY GOOD, HUH?

337
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:56,066
- YOU'RE GONNA PUT MARTA 
ONSTAGE WITH THE LEGS?

338
00:12:56,066 --> 00:12:58,360
- IT'S GONNA BLOW UP. 
LEGS GET UPSET.

339
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,778
MARTA GETS UPSET.

340
00:12:59,778 --> 00:13:01,488
MARTA LEAVES GOB, 
AND I DON'T GET SHOT.

341
00:13:01,488 --> 00:13:03,157
- YOU'LL NEVER BE ABLE 
TO PULL THE TRIGGER ON THIS.

342
00:13:03,157 --> 00:13:05,492
YOU CAN'T ESCAPE IT, MICHAEL. 
YOU'RE THE GOOD GUY.

343
00:13:05,492 --> 00:13:06,827
- CALL ME WHAT YOU WANT.

344
00:13:06,827 --> 00:13:08,245
- AN IMPOTENT MAN-BOY?

345
00:13:08,245 --> 00:13:11,665
- BUT IT IS DONE. 
THE PLAN IS IN MOTION.

346
00:13:11,665 --> 00:13:12,833
- THIS JUST ISN'T YOU.

347
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:16,378
- IT'S ME NOW. 
IT'S THE ME THAT CAN RECLINE.

348
00:13:16,378 --> 00:13:17,421
thump!

349
00:13:17,421 --> 00:13:20,966
- DID THAT HURT? 
- NO.

350
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:22,759
- THIS STUFF'S KIND OF HOT, 
ISN'T IT?

351
00:13:22,759 --> 00:13:27,264
- I HADN'T NOTICED. 
- HEY, GANG.

352
00:13:27,264 --> 00:13:29,266
MIND IF SQUEEZE IN HERE 
FOR A MOMENT?

353
00:13:29,266 --> 00:13:30,517
OH!

354
00:13:30,517 --> 00:13:31,643
LOOK AT US.

355
00:13:31,643 --> 00:13:36,065
WHO'D WANNA MESS 
WITH ANY OF US, HUH?

356
00:13:36,065 --> 00:13:41,653
- EXCUSE ME. 
- YES. OOP.

357
00:13:41,653 --> 00:13:42,947
- DID YOU GET A JOB 
OR SOMETHING?

358
00:13:42,947 --> 00:13:44,823
- NO, NO, I DIDN'T.

359
00:13:44,823 --> 00:13:48,953
UNLESS YOU CONSIDER 
"WORLD'S COOLEST DADDY" A JOB.

360
00:13:48,953 --> 00:13:53,540
IF I-- 
[chokes and grunts]

361
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:54,583
- HEY, DAD.

362
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:55,709
- HEY, BUDDY.

363
00:13:55,709 --> 00:13:57,294
YOU'RE STILL 
WEARING THAT JACKET, HUH?

364
00:13:57,294 --> 00:13:59,546
- YEAH. I WAS JUST 
GOING FOR A NEW LOOK.

365
00:13:59,546 --> 00:14:00,881
- YEAH?

366
00:14:00,881 --> 00:14:02,674
- TRYING TO INTRODUCE 
SOME EDGE TO THE WHOLE PALETTE.

367
00:14:02,674 --> 00:14:04,051
- HMM, KIND OF LIKED YOU 
THE WAY YOU WERE.

368
00:14:04,051 --> 00:14:05,427
- YOU DID?

369
00:14:05,427 --> 00:14:06,470
- YEAH, I MEAN, 
WE CAN'T REALLY

370
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:07,972
CHANGE WHO WE ARE ANYWAY, 
RIGHT?

371
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:09,306
- WISH YOU'D TOLD ME THAT

372
00:14:09,306 --> 00:14:10,640
BEFORE I THREW AWAY 
MY WINDBREAKER.

373
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:12,017
OH, YOU BOUGHT A CHAIR.

374
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:14,811
- UH, NO, ACTUALLY, 
I BORROWED IT.

375
00:14:14,811 --> 00:14:16,521
LIKE WE TALKED ABOUT.

376
00:14:16,521 --> 00:14:19,649
- WELL, I THOUGHT WE DECIDED 
THAT WAS LIKE STEALING.

377
00:14:19,649 --> 00:14:22,486
- IS THAT WHERE WE LANDED 
ON THAT?

378
00:14:22,486 --> 00:14:24,196
- narrator: AS MICHAEL 
WAS BECOMING MORE SELFISH,

379
00:14:24,196 --> 00:14:27,116
HIS FATHER WAS CHOOSING 
A MORE PIOUS PATH.

380
00:14:29,243 --> 00:14:32,371
WHICH MADE 
BUSTER AND LUCILLE'S VISIT

381
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:34,206
GO MUCH DIFFERENTLY 
THAN PLANNED.

382
00:14:34,206 --> 00:14:36,583
- WHY IS THERE 
A PIECE OF SHOE ON YOUR HEAD?

383
00:14:36,583 --> 00:14:39,294
- THIS IS A-- 
WELL, IT'S A REMINDER

384
00:14:39,294 --> 00:14:42,589
THAT THE DIVINE PRESENCE 
IS ALWAYS ABOVE ME.

385
00:14:42,589 --> 00:14:45,050
- WELL, MORE IMPORTANTLY,

386
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:47,677
BUSTER'S BEEN HUMPING 
THE WIDOW AUSTERO.

387
00:14:47,677 --> 00:14:50,014
- MOM. 
- IS THAT TRUE?

388
00:14:50,014 --> 00:14:52,182
- NO. WE'RE TAKING IT SLOW.

389
00:14:52,182 --> 00:14:55,936
- HE STAYS THERE SOMETIMES 
UNTIL 7:00, 8:00 AT NIGHT.

390
00:14:55,936 --> 00:14:57,854
PEANUT BRITTLE ON HIS BREATH.

391
00:14:57,854 --> 00:15:00,107
IS SHE THE ONE WHO'S GOING TO 
TAKE HIM TO THE DENTIST?

392
00:15:00,107 --> 00:15:03,568
- SHE ALREADY HAS. 
- [gasps]

393
00:15:03,568 --> 00:15:05,905
- [sighs]

394
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:09,783
[speaking Yiddish]

395
00:15:09,783 --> 00:15:10,825
- WHAT?

396
00:15:10,825 --> 00:15:12,244
- "MAY YOU LIVE. 
MAY YOU BE WELL.

397
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:13,620
I GIVE YOU MY BLESSING."

398
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:14,914
- WOW! REALLY?

399
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:16,123
- ARE YOU 
OUT OF YOUR MIND?

400
00:15:16,123 --> 00:15:18,417
- JUST FOLLOW THE HEART 
THAT GOD GAVE YOU, HMM?

401
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:19,919
- NO TOUCHING.

402
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:22,837
NO--

403
00:15:22,837 --> 00:15:24,506
[clears throat]

404
00:15:27,801 --> 00:15:31,263
- CAN YOU GET ME 
SOME OF THAT PEANUT BRITTLE?

405
00:15:31,263 --> 00:15:32,764
- narrator: 
ON THE NIGHT OF THE SHOW,

406
00:15:32,764 --> 00:15:35,600
THE FAMILY ARRIVED 
AT THE GOTHIC CASTLE,

407
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,061
AND IN THE GREEN ROOM,

408
00:15:37,061 --> 00:15:39,229
MICHAEL WAS PREPARING MARTA 
FOR THE TRICK.

409
00:15:39,229 --> 00:15:41,190
- AT THE BOTTOM OF THE BOX.

410
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:44,443
AND YOU TWO GUYS 
ARE FREE TO TALK.

411
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:46,153
OKAY. 
GOB, GOB, GOB.

412
00:15:46,153 --> 00:15:48,072
- WHAT IS GOING ON? 
WHERE'S THE TOP HALF?

413
00:15:48,072 --> 00:15:52,201
I HAVE TO TEACH HER THIS TRICK. 
SHE'S GOTTA FOLD HER KNEES.

414
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:53,994
- IT'S A FANTASTIC TRICK.

415
00:15:53,994 --> 00:15:55,204
I DON'T WANT YOU 
TO WORRY, THOUGH.

416
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:56,746
I'VE ALREADY TOLD HER.

417
00:15:56,746 --> 00:15:59,041
NOW, WHERE ARE THE LEGS? 
ARE THEY RUNNING LATE?

418
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:00,875
- SO IS EVERYONE HERE?

419
00:16:00,875 --> 00:16:02,419
- I THINK SO. 
I HAVEN'T SEEN TOBIAS.

420
00:16:02,419 --> 00:16:05,214
- narrator: IN FACT, 
TOBIAS HAD INTENDED TO COME,

421
00:16:05,214 --> 00:16:07,257
BUT HAD A SLIGHT 
MISCOMMUNICATION

422
00:16:07,257 --> 00:16:08,675
WITH HIS CABDRIVER.

423
00:16:08,675 --> 00:16:11,220
- WHERE TO, MATE? 
- THE GOTHIC CASTLE.

424
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:14,389
- GOTHIC ASSHOLE? 
- THAT'S WHAT I SAID.

425
00:16:14,389 --> 00:16:17,977
- narrator: AND ENDED UP 
IN THE WRONG LOCATION.

426
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:21,063
[club music pounding]

427
00:16:21,063 --> 00:16:23,482
- OH, I AM GLAD 
I DIDN'T GO WITH THAT OUTFIT.

428
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:27,652
YES, HELLO. 
I AM LOOKING FOR THE MAGIC.

429
00:16:27,652 --> 00:16:29,279
DANKE SCHOEN.

430
00:16:32,657 --> 00:16:35,535
- OH. 
HELLO, LUCILLE.

431
00:16:35,535 --> 00:16:36,828
- HELLO, LUCILLE.

432
00:16:36,828 --> 00:16:38,497
HAVING A GOOD TIME 
WITH MY SON?

433
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:40,124
- ACTUALLY, WE'RE HAVING 
A WONDERFUL TIME.

434
00:16:40,124 --> 00:16:42,001
- YOU KNOW, 
HE'S DAMAGED GOODS.

435
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:44,836
HE WAS BORN WITH 
A HOLE IN HIS HEART.

436
00:16:44,836 --> 00:16:46,171
- NOW, 
LISTEN TO ME, LUCILLE.

437
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:48,590
I'M GONNA FILL THAT HOLE, 
'CAUSE WE'RE IN LOVE.

438
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:49,841
- OH, PLEASE.

439
00:16:49,841 --> 00:16:51,760
YOU'RE NO MORE 
IN LOVE WITH HIM THAN I AM.

440
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,345
- OKAY, WE'RE ALL 
SAYING SOME THINGS

441
00:16:53,345 --> 00:16:54,388
WE'RE GOING TO REGRET.

442
00:16:54,388 --> 00:16:56,723
- narrator: MEANWHILE, 
GOB WAS ALMOST READY

443
00:16:56,723 --> 00:16:58,808
TO BEGIN HIS SHOW.

444
00:16:58,808 --> 00:17:00,644
- OKAY. 
IT'S MAGIC TIME.

445
00:17:00,644 --> 00:17:01,686
- HEY, GOOD LUCK OUT THERE NOW.

446
00:17:01,686 --> 00:17:03,480
- HEY, LISTEN, 
I GOT YOU SOMETHING

447
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:05,232
FOR BEING SUCH A GOOD GUY,

448
00:17:05,232 --> 00:17:07,151
NOT THAT IT'S A SURPRISE, 
YOU ALWAYS ARE.

449
00:17:07,151 --> 00:17:13,198
- OH, WELL, UH-- 
MY WATCH.

450
00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:14,783
- I WANT YOU TO HAVE IT.

451
00:17:14,783 --> 00:17:16,660
- WELL, YOU'VE STOLEN 
SO MANY THINGS FROM ME

452
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:17,869
OVER THE YEARS.

453
00:17:17,869 --> 00:17:19,204
THIS IS THE FIRST TIME

454
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:21,081
YOU'VE EVER 
GIVEN SOMETHING BACK.

455
00:17:21,081 --> 00:17:22,291
I WANNA TRY TO BE 
A BETTER BROTHER,

456
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:24,043
LIKE YOU ARE TO ME.

457
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:28,213
- WE'RE READY FOR YOU.

458
00:17:28,213 --> 00:17:31,341
- GOB...

459
00:17:31,341 --> 00:17:33,343
HAVE A GOOD SHOW 
OUT THERE.

460
00:17:33,343 --> 00:17:34,844
[Europe's "The Final Countdown" 
plays]

461
00:17:34,844 --> 00:17:38,973
- LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, 
A MAGICIAN NAMED GOB.

462
00:17:38,973 --> 00:17:46,898
[music grows louder]

463
00:17:57,117 --> 00:17:59,869
- DAD? 
- HEY, GEORGE MICHAEL.

464
00:17:59,869 --> 00:18:01,621
WHERE'S THE LEATHER JACKET?

465
00:18:01,621 --> 00:18:03,707
- IT'S LIKE YOU SAID, 
YOU CAN'T CHANGE WHO YOU ARE.

466
00:18:03,707 --> 00:18:04,749
SO WHAT?

467
00:18:04,749 --> 00:18:06,251
SO I DON'T HAVE ANY HAIR 
ON MY ARMS OR LEGS.

468
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:07,294
SO WHAT?

469
00:18:07,294 --> 00:18:09,754
YOU KNOW, A LEATHER JACKET'S 
NOT GONNA CHANGE THAT.

470
00:18:09,754 --> 00:18:11,465
YOU KNOW, I WAS TRYING 
TO ACT LIKE A TOUGH GUY,

471
00:18:11,465 --> 00:18:12,466
AND IT'S WRONG.

472
00:18:12,466 --> 00:18:14,176
I'M JUST A BORING, 
OLD NICE GUY LIKE YOU.

473
00:18:14,176 --> 00:18:16,052
- I'M NOT THAT NICE.

474
00:18:16,052 --> 00:18:17,471
- DAD, IF THIS 
IS ABOUT THE CHAIR,

475
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:18,555
I'VE BEEN THINKING.

476
00:18:18,555 --> 00:18:19,973
YOU DESERVE IT.

477
00:18:19,973 --> 00:18:22,892
YOU KNOW, IT'S NOT LIKE 
YOU'D EVER STEAL SOMETHING BIG.

478
00:18:22,892 --> 00:18:24,811
- narrator: MICHAEL 
WAS HAVING SECOND THOUGHTS

479
00:18:24,811 --> 00:18:25,979
ABOUT HIS PLAN,

480
00:18:25,979 --> 00:18:28,190
BUT THEN HE GOT 
SOME UNEXPECTED HELP.

481
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:29,524
- HEY, I'M SORRY TO INTERRUPT.

482
00:18:29,524 --> 00:18:31,568
YOU'D BETTER TELL GOB, 
THE LEGS AREN'T COMING.

483
00:18:31,568 --> 00:18:32,611
- OH, MY GOD.

484
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:34,946
- I CAN'T BELIEVE THE LEGS 
WOULD SCREW HIM LIKE THIS.

485
00:18:34,946 --> 00:18:36,573
THIS IS HIS ONE LAST CHANCE.

486
00:18:36,573 --> 00:18:38,908
THEY'LL NEVER 
LET HIM IN THE ALLIANCE AGAIN.

487
00:18:38,908 --> 00:18:40,244
YOU HAVE TO DO SOMETHING.

488
00:18:40,244 --> 00:18:44,331
THIS IS SO IMPORTANT 
TO ME AND GOB.

489
00:18:44,331 --> 00:18:46,625
- WHERE AM I GONNA GET A PAIR 
OF BEAUTIFUL WOMEN'S LEGS

490
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:49,128
ON SUCH SHORT NOTICE?

491
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:52,256
- narrator: SO THE TRICK 
WENT FORWARD AS PLANNED.

492
00:18:52,256 --> 00:18:56,385
- AND NOW, MY HOPEFULLY LOVELY 
ASSISTANT WILL JOIN ME.

493
00:18:56,385 --> 00:19:04,017
[applause]

494
00:19:10,482 --> 00:19:12,401
- OH!

495
00:19:15,445 --> 00:19:18,240
- WIGGLE THOSE 
SEXY GAMS, LADY.

496
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:22,911
- I'M OKAY WITH MYSELF. 
I'M OKAY WITH MYSELF.

497
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:28,458
- [giggles]

498
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:31,002
- MOM, DID YOU SEE IT? 
I'M BACK IN.

499
00:19:31,002 --> 00:19:34,005
I'VE GOT THE CAREER BACK.

500
00:19:34,005 --> 00:19:35,590
HANK YOU FOR COMING.

AND WHEN LUCILLE NOTICED

502
00:19:37,133 --> 00:19:39,469
HOW HAPPY MARTA HAD MADE GOB,

503
00:19:39,469 --> 00:19:44,308
SHE REALIZED HOW IMPORTANT 
LOVE WAS TO HER CHILDREN.

504
00:19:44,308 --> 00:19:46,351
- MOM. 
- HELLO, BUSTER.

505
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:48,812
- IF YOU'RE STILL MAD, 
I DON'T CARE.

506
00:19:48,812 --> 00:19:50,314
I'M IN LOVE.

507
00:19:50,314 --> 00:19:54,067
- I ACTUALLY CAME TO ASK 
LUCILLE SOMETHING.

508
00:19:54,067 --> 00:19:56,611
- WHAT? 
- I WAS WONDERING

509
00:19:56,611 --> 00:20:00,949
IF YOU'D LIKE TO PLAY BRIDGE 
WITH ME NEXT WEEK?

510
00:20:00,949 --> 00:20:05,787
- OH, I'D ABSOLUTELY ADORE IT. 
OH, LUCILLE.

511
00:20:05,787 --> 00:20:08,122
OH, GOD. 
LOOK AT US, BUSTER.

512
00:20:08,122 --> 00:20:11,876
WE'RE BACK TOGETHER AGAIN: 
LUCILLE AND LUCILLE.

513
00:20:11,876 --> 00:20:13,337
- YOU GUYS ARE FRIENDS AGAIN.

514
00:20:13,337 --> 00:20:15,255
YOU CAN PLAY BRIDGE TOGETHER.

515
00:20:15,255 --> 00:20:17,173
[kissing noise 
and Buster yelling]

516
00:20:17,173 --> 00:20:20,009
COULD YOU JUST-- 
JUST SEPARATE?

517
00:20:20,009 --> 00:20:21,970
[loud cough]

518
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:23,888
- narrator: MICHAEL WATCHED 
AS THE BROTHER

519
00:20:23,888 --> 00:20:26,266
HE SWORE TO STOP HELPING

520
00:20:26,266 --> 00:20:29,478
ENJOYED THE GIRLFRIEND 
HE HELPED HIM REUNITE WITH.

521
00:20:32,063 --> 00:20:34,358
AND SO HE RETURNED TO WORK,

522
00:20:34,358 --> 00:20:37,861
ACCEPTING THE FACT 
THAT HE WAS A GOOD GUY

523
00:20:37,861 --> 00:20:40,905
BUT NOT AS GOOD 
AS EVERYONE THOUGHT.

524
00:20:45,910 --> 00:20:48,872
- THIS REALLY WORKED BETTER 
WITH THE CHAIR.

525
00:20:48,872 --> 00:20:51,333
- narrator: ON THE NEXT 
"ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT."

526
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:53,793
THE ALLIANCE DECIDES 
TO LET GOB BACK IN.

527
00:20:53,793 --> 00:20:54,878
- TELL ME, 
HOW DID YOU GET

528
00:20:54,878 --> 00:20:57,171
TWO ALLIANCE-APPROVED ASSISTANTS 
WITH SUCH SHORT NOTICE?

529
00:20:57,171 --> 00:20:59,383
- OH, THAT WAS JUST 
MY GIRLFRIEND AND MY NEPHEW.

530
00:20:59,383 --> 00:21:01,968
[murmuring ]

531
00:21:01,968 --> 00:21:03,553

- narrator: AND TOBIAS 
GETS SOME GOOD NEWS.

533
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:07,682
- I GOT A GIG.

534
00:21:07,682 --> 00:21:11,561
- [singing] THERE'S WHERE 
MY HEART IS TURNING EVER

535
00:21:11,561 --> 00:21:16,065
THERE'S WHERE 
THE OLD FOLKS STAY

536
00:21:16,065 --> 00:21:17,233
[whip cracks]
