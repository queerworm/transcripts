narrator: 
NOW THE STORY

2
00:00:02,627 --> 00:00:04,462
OF A WEALTHY FAMILY 
WHO LOST EVERYTHING

3
00:00:04,462 --> 00:00:06,464
AND THE ONE SON 
WHO HAD NO CHOICE

4
00:00:06,464 --> 00:00:08,508
BUT TO KEEP THEM ALL TOGETHER.

5
00:00:14,264 --> 00:00:16,182
IT'S "ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT."

6
00:00:19,810 --> 00:00:22,313
MICHAEL HAD BEGUN 
TO WORK WEEKENDS.

7
00:00:22,313 --> 00:00:24,065
UNFORTUNATELY, 
THIS INTERFERED

8
00:00:24,065 --> 00:00:25,816
WITH THE SATURDAY MORNING 
BIKE RIDE

9
00:00:25,816 --> 00:00:28,319
HE USUALLY TOOK WITH HIS SON.

10
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:32,490
- SO THIS ISN'T BAD, RIGHT? 
JUST LIKE A NORMAL SATURDAY.

11
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:34,200
YOU KNOW, DAD, 
YOU DON'T HAVE TO DRIVE SO SLOW.

12
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:35,576
I CAN RIDE MY BIKE 
BY MYSELF.

13
00:00:35,576 --> 00:00:37,703
- THIS ACTUALLY 
DOESN'T GO ANY FASTER.

14
00:00:37,703 --> 00:00:38,704
[phone ringing]

15
00:00:38,704 --> 00:00:40,415
- I MEAN, I KNOW YOU HAVE 
A LOT OF WORK, YOU KNOW?

16
00:00:40,415 --> 00:00:42,417
- IT STILL DOESN'T MEAN 
I CAN'T HANG OUT WITH MY--

17
00:00:42,417 --> 00:00:44,460
HANG ON ONE SECOND. 
THIS IS MICHAEL.

18
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:47,255
MOM, I'M EXPECTING 
A VERY IMPORTANT PHONE--

19
00:00:47,255 --> 00:00:49,048
FOR GOD'S SAKES! 
I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.

20
00:00:49,048 --> 00:00:50,383
- DAD. DAD!

21
00:00:50,383 --> 00:00:52,093
[bike brakes screeching]

22
00:00:52,093 --> 00:00:55,638
- NICE INSTINCTS, SON. 
GOOD REFLEXES.

23
00:00:55,638 --> 00:00:57,057
narrator: BACK AT 
THE MODEL HOME,

24
00:00:57,057 --> 00:00:59,559
LINDSAY AWOKE LATE 
TO FIND HER HUSBAND MISSING.

25
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:02,895
- MAEBY? MICHAEL? TOBIAS?

26
00:01:02,895 --> 00:01:04,064
WORK?

27
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:05,940
narrator: TOBIAS HAD RECENTLY 
BEEN CAST IN A MOVIE,

28
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:09,319
PLAYING THE ROLE 
OF A FRIGHTENED INMATE.

29
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:12,863
- I AIN'T GOING TO SQUEAL, MAN. 
[scoffs]

30
00:01:12,863 --> 00:01:17,743
I AIN'T GOING TO-- 
OH, I'M NOT FRIGHTENED! GOD!

31
00:01:17,743 --> 00:01:20,163
LINDSAY, SAY SOMETHING 
TO SCARE ME.

32
00:01:20,163 --> 00:01:21,622
- [beep] ME.

33
00:01:23,999 --> 00:01:27,044
- NOPE. NOTHING. 
THANKS FOR TRYING, THOUGH.

34
00:01:27,044 --> 00:01:28,921
YOU KNOW WHAT I OUGHT TO DO?

35
00:01:28,921 --> 00:01:32,383
I OUGHT TO CHECK MYSELF 
INTO A MEN'S PENAL COLONY.

36
00:01:32,383 --> 00:01:35,386
PERHAPS YOUR FATHER 
COULD GET ME IN.

37
00:01:35,386 --> 00:01:38,598
- WELL, IF HE CAN GO TO WORK, 
SO CAN I.

38
00:01:38,598 --> 00:01:41,058
narrator: LUCILLE, MEANWHILE, 
WAS GROWING CLOSER

39
00:01:41,058 --> 00:01:42,477
TO HER RECENTLY ADOPTED 
KOREAN SON,

40
00:01:42,477 --> 00:01:44,145
WHOM SHE CALLED ANNYONG.

41
00:01:44,145 --> 00:01:45,230
- MUCH BETTER, ANNYONG.

42
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:46,481
narrator: WHICH ISN'T A NAME,

43
00:01:46,481 --> 00:01:48,608
BUT THE KOREAN WORD 
FOR "HELLO".

44
00:01:48,608 --> 00:01:50,360
- AND I GUESS I CAN 
COMB MY OWN HAIR.

45
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,402
- OH, PLEASE.

46
00:01:51,402 --> 00:01:52,903
HE'S A LITTLE BOY,

47
00:01:52,903 --> 00:01:55,490
AND SINCE HE'S GOING TO GO OFF 
AND WORK FOR 10 HOURS,

48
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:57,658
I WANT HIM TO LOOK NICE.

49
00:01:57,658 --> 00:02:01,162
- THANK YOU, LUPE. 
- YOU GOT A JOB, ANNYONG?

50
00:02:01,162 --> 00:02:02,622
- ANNYONG. 
- ANNYONG.

51
00:02:02,622 --> 00:02:03,623
- ANNYONG.

52
00:02:03,623 --> 00:02:05,082
- AT THE BANANA STAND.

53
00:02:05,082 --> 00:02:07,293
OH, HIS WORK 
ETHIC IS UNBELIEVABLE,

54
00:02:07,293 --> 00:02:09,545
UNLIKE SOME SONS I KNOW.

55
00:02:09,545 --> 00:02:13,048
- I'M A SCHOLAR. 
I ENJOY SCHOLARLY PURSUITS.

56
00:02:13,048 --> 00:02:14,884
- [sighs]

57
00:02:14,884 --> 00:02:17,678
SUDDENLY PLAYING WITH YOURSELF 
IS A SCHOLARLY PURSUIT.

58
00:02:19,764 --> 00:02:22,767
- HEY, LUPE. 
- [sighs]

59
00:02:22,767 --> 00:02:24,435
- WHAT'S WRONG WITH LUPE? 
- OH, SHE'S UPSET

60
00:02:24,435 --> 00:02:26,604
BECAUSE I TOLD HER 
SHE COULDN'T TAKE THE DAY OFF.

61
00:02:26,604 --> 00:02:29,399
THERE'S A FAMILY REUNION 
IN CATALINA.

62
00:02:29,399 --> 00:02:31,651
- CATALINA? WE'RE NOT GOING 
TO CATALINA, ARE WE?

63
00:02:31,651 --> 00:02:33,319
narrator: BUSTER HAD 
AN UNFORTUNATE ENCOUNTER

64
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:35,196
IN A PHOTO BOOTH 
ON THE WILDLIFE-POPULATED

65
00:02:35,196 --> 00:02:37,365
ISLAND OF CATALINA.

66
00:02:37,365 --> 00:02:39,074
- NO, LUPE IS. 
YOU SEE, FOR HER,

67
00:02:39,074 --> 00:02:42,203
A FAMILY REUNION MIGHT ACTUALLY 
BE A PLEASANT EXPERIENCE.

68
00:02:42,203 --> 00:02:44,164
- THEY'VE GOT A BUS, 
AND THEY WANT TO USE

69
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:46,166
THE PARKING LOT TO THIS BUILDING 
AS A MEETING PLACE.

70
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:50,795
I MEAN, FOR GOD'S SAKE, 
IT'S NOT A HARDWARE STORE.

71
00:02:50,795 --> 00:02:52,713
WE CAN'T HAVE THEM 
HANGING AROUND LIKE FREELOADERS,

72
00:02:52,713 --> 00:02:55,425
LOOKING FOR AN EASY BUCK.

73
00:02:55,425 --> 00:02:57,260
- WHAT'S THE EMERGENCY, MOM?

74
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:58,511
- I NEED MONEY.

75
00:02:58,511 --> 00:03:00,054
- I DON'T HAVE TIME 
FOR THIS, OKAY?

76
00:03:00,054 --> 00:03:01,264
I DON'T EVEN 
GET TO SEE MY OWN SON.

77
00:03:01,264 --> 00:03:02,848
I'M GOING TO GO TO WORK NOW.

78
00:03:02,848 --> 00:03:04,725
- AND WHILE YOU'RE THERE, 
FIND OUT FROM YOUR ASSISTANT,

79
00:03:04,725 --> 00:03:08,103
KITTY, WHY SHE DIDN'T SEND 
MY PAYCHECK.

80
00:03:08,103 --> 00:03:10,898
- YOU GET A PAYCHECK 
FROM THE BLUTH COMPANY?

81
00:03:10,898 --> 00:03:12,275
- WELL, IT'S IMPORTANT 
TO THE COMPANY

82
00:03:12,275 --> 00:03:14,360
THAT I KEEP UP THE IMAGE 
OF MY LIFESTYLE.

83
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,861
- ILLUSION, MOM.

84
00:03:15,861 --> 00:03:17,988
AND I'M THE PRESIDENT 
OF THAT COMPANY.

85
00:03:17,988 --> 00:03:19,657
I BELIEVE I'M THE ONE 
THAT ASKED YOU

86
00:03:19,657 --> 00:03:21,326
TO START SHOPPING 
AT QUANTITY PLUS.

87
00:03:21,326 --> 00:03:26,997
- AND THEY MADE ME APPLY 
FOR A MEMBERSHIP CARD.

88
00:03:26,997 --> 00:03:28,374
IT WAS HUMILIATING.

89
00:03:28,374 --> 00:03:30,084
- I'LL SEE WHAT 
I CAN DO FOR YOU.

90
00:03:30,084 --> 00:03:32,587
AND NOW THAT I KNOW THAT 
I'M THE ONE THAT PAYS LUPE,

91
00:03:32,587 --> 00:03:35,256
I'M GIVING HER 
THE DAY OFF, OKAY?

92
00:03:35,256 --> 00:03:36,299
LUPE, DID YOU HEAR THAT?

93
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:38,133
TELL YOUR BUS DRIVER 
THAT HE CAN PICK UP YOUR FAMILY

94
00:03:38,133 --> 00:03:40,220
AT THE BLUTH COMPANY 
PARKING LOT.

95
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:45,140
- OH, THANK YOU, MICHAEL. 
- MY HERO.

96
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:47,977
- ANYWAY, YOU ENJOY 
THAT PAYCHECK WHEN YOU GET IT.

97
00:03:47,977 --> 00:03:49,812
IT WILL BE THE LAST ONE 
I EVER SEND HERE.

98
00:03:49,812 --> 00:03:52,232
- DOES THAT MEAN I HAVE TO GO 
TO YOUR OFFICE TO GET MINE, TOO,

99
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:54,275
OR HOW'S THAT WORK?

100
00:03:54,275 --> 00:03:56,527
- YOU GOTTA BE KIDDING ME. 
ALL RIGHT.

101
00:03:56,527 --> 00:03:57,987
YOU KNOW WHAT, BUSTER?

102
00:03:57,987 --> 00:04:00,155
BOB, IN THE COPY ROOM, 
HE QUIT TODAY.

103
00:04:00,155 --> 00:04:01,324
IF YOU WANT YOUR MONEY,

104
00:04:01,324 --> 00:04:03,243
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO 
WORK FOR IT.

105
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:07,330
- OKAY. I ACCEPT. 
I'LL TAKE THAT JOB.

106
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:09,582
I WILL WORK IN THE COPY ROOM.

107
00:04:14,295 --> 00:04:18,173
- I WOULDN'T GO IN THERE 
WITHOUT KNOCKING, MICHAEL.

108
00:04:18,173 --> 00:04:20,343
- NOW, I KNOW WE'VE BEEN 
PUTTING IN A LOT OF HOURS,

109
00:04:20,343 --> 00:04:22,845
BUT WE'VE GOT TO KEEP OUR 
HEADS DOWN AND POWER THROUGH,

110
00:04:22,845 --> 00:04:25,139
YOU KNOW, AND--AND SACRIFICE.

111
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:27,558
- [chuckles] 
DON'T MIND ME.

112
00:04:27,558 --> 00:04:29,560
I'M JUST HERE TO PICK UP 
MY PAYCHECK AND GET OUT OF HERE.

113
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:34,607
- GUYS, GO AHEAD 
AND TAKE A THREE.

114
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:36,984
LINDSAY, HOW CAN YOU 
JUST COME IN HERE

115
00:04:36,984 --> 00:04:39,153
AND ASK ME FOR A PAYCHECK?

116
00:04:39,153 --> 00:04:41,364
- WELL, I USUALLY ASK KITTY, 
UH, BUT SHE'S NOT AROUND,

117
00:04:41,364 --> 00:04:43,991
AND YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE HERE 
I'VE EVER SEEN BEFORE.

118
00:04:43,991 --> 00:04:45,242
- HOW LONG HAS THIS 
BEEN GOING ON?

119
00:04:45,242 --> 00:04:47,537
- DAD HIRED ME OUT OF COLLEGE.

120
00:04:47,537 --> 00:04:49,580
- YOU QUIT COLLEGE.

121
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:51,206
- YEAH, WELL, I HAD A JOB. 
WHAT WAS THE POINT?

122
00:04:51,206 --> 00:04:52,207
- WELL, YOU HAVE A JOB NOW.

123
00:04:52,207 --> 00:04:53,543
SINCE KITTY'S GONE,

124
00:04:53,543 --> 00:04:55,210
YOU CAN EARN YOUR CHECK 
BY ANSWERING THE PHONES.

125
00:04:55,210 --> 00:04:58,130
- MICHAEL, IT'S FRIDAY. 
EVERYBODY COASTS ON FRIDAY.

126
00:04:58,130 --> 00:04:59,424
- IT'S ACTUALLY SATURDAY.

127
00:04:59,424 --> 00:05:00,675
- FINALLY. 
I'M OUT OF HERE.

128
00:05:00,675 --> 00:05:02,009
I'LL SEE YOU TUESDAY.

129
00:05:02,009 --> 00:05:04,970
- I'M SERIOUS, LINDSAY.

130
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:06,722
- THIS IS WHY 
YOUR EMPLOYEES HATE YOU.

131
00:05:06,722 --> 00:05:08,015
- THEY'RE ACTUALLY 
QUITE FOND OF ME.

132
00:05:08,015 --> 00:05:09,266
[toilet flushing]

133
00:05:09,266 --> 00:05:10,643
- OKAY, GUYS, 
BACK TO THE STAFF MEETING.

134
00:05:10,643 --> 00:05:15,856
[groaning]

135
00:05:15,856 --> 00:05:18,192
-UH, LINDSAY. HELLO. 
THE PHONES.

136
00:05:18,192 --> 00:05:21,321
-WELL, YOU SAID "STAFF."

137
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:23,906
THE ZONING COMMITTEE 
FEELS THAT WE'RE

138
00:05:23,906 --> 00:05:26,826
TRYING TO SQUEEZE TOO MANY UNITS 
ONTO A LOT THIS SIZE,

139
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:28,911
AND OBVIOUSLY WE NEED TO 
IF WE WANT TO MAKE A PROFIT.

140
00:05:28,911 --> 00:05:31,205
SO HOW DO WE FIT 
THESE UNITS ON THERE?

141
00:05:31,205 --> 00:05:33,541
- ARE THESE FLUORESCENT LIGHTS 
BOTHERING ANYBODY ELSE

142
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:35,250
BESIDES ME?

143
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:37,462
-THAT'S NOT WHAT 
I WANT TO DEAL WITH TODAY.

144
00:05:37,462 --> 00:05:39,464
- WELL, YOU AND I HAVE DIFFERENT 
MANAGEMENT STYLES.

145
00:05:39,464 --> 00:05:40,673
I BELIEVE WORK SHOULD BE FUN,

146
00:05:40,673 --> 00:05:42,216
AND YOU TRY TO CRUSH 
PEOPLE'S SPIRITS.

147
00:05:42,216 --> 00:05:43,342
WHAT'S NEXT, MICHAEL?

148
00:05:43,342 --> 00:05:45,260
ARE YOU GOING TO 
MAKE DANCING ILLEGAL?

149
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:47,179
IS THIS THE TINY TOWN 
FROM FOOTLOOSE?

150
00:05:47,179 --> 00:05:49,557
[chuckling and mumbling]

151
00:05:49,557 --> 00:05:51,851
- CAN YOU GO TO YOUR DESK, 
PLEASE?

152
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:53,143
BE LIKE BUSTER.

153
00:05:53,143 --> 00:05:55,104
HE'S BEEN IN THE COPY ROOM. 
I HAVEN'T SEEN HIM ALL DAY.

154
00:05:55,104 --> 00:05:56,606
narrator: IN FACT, 
BUSTER HAD GROWN ANXIOUS

155
00:05:56,606 --> 00:05:58,941
IN THE CONFINED SPACE 
OF THE COPY ROOM.

156
00:05:58,941 --> 00:06:00,443
- BOB? 
- BOB?

157
00:06:00,443 --> 00:06:01,486

00:06:01,486 --> 00:06:02,528
- BOB? 
- [sheep bleating]

159
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:03,654
- BOB?

160
00:06:03,654 --> 00:06:06,907
- [gasping] 
- BOB?

161
00:06:06,907 --> 00:06:08,868
- I NEED A DIFFERENT JOB.

162
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:11,954
I'M HAVING REAL TROUBLE 
IN A CONFINED INDOOR SPACE.

163
00:06:11,954 --> 00:06:14,123
OH. HEY, COWORKER.

164
00:06:14,123 --> 00:06:16,417
- HOW DO YOU FEEL 
ABOUT WORKING OUTDOORS?

165
00:06:16,417 --> 00:06:19,712
- UH, WHAT ELSE DO YOU HAVE?

166
00:06:23,591 --> 00:06:26,552
narrator: AT THE BANANA STAND, 
GEORGE MICHAEL WAS ALSO WORKING.

167
00:06:26,552 --> 00:06:28,471
- I THOUGHT YOUR DAD 
WORKED LAST WEEKEND.

168
00:06:28,471 --> 00:06:30,806

PLANNING THE NEW SUBDIVISION.

169
00:06:30,806 --> 00:06:33,976

170
00:06:33,976 --> 00:06:38,230

TRYING TO MAKE ME FEEL BAD?

171
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:40,733

173
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:46,531

MORE THAN HE LIKES YOU.

00:06:58,709 --> 00:07:00,878
- IT WOULD BE AN HONOR 
TO HAVE YOU RESEARCH

181
00:07:00,878 --> 00:07:02,046
IN THIS INSTITUTION.

182
00:07:02,046 --> 00:07:03,088

I HAVE THIS SCRIPT 
I'D LOVE TO GET TO CARL.

185
00:07:10,012 --> 00:07:12,139

186
00:07:12,139 --> 00:07:13,724

COULD EASILY BE BLACK.

187
00:07:13,724 --> 00:07:15,935

AND I CAN'T PUT YOU INTO 212,

191
00:07:27,321 --> 00:07:29,323
BECAUSE THERE'S ALREADY 
ANOTHER ACTOR

192

RESEARCHING A ROLE IN THERE-- 
STEVE BUSCEMI.

HAD ARRIVED 
AT THE CONSTRUCTION SITE,

201
00:07:52,429 --> 00:07:55,307
AND BUSTER WAS ACTUALLY 
STARTING TO ENJOY HIMSELF.

202
00:07:55,307 --> 00:07:58,561

I'M REINFORCING THE HEADER!

WE'RE BEHIND ON THE PAYROLL,

00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:05,442
BUT AS SOON THE ZONING COMMITTEE 
GIVES ME THEIR APPROVAL,

00:08:05,442 --> 00:08:06,902
I KNOW THE BANK'S 
GONNA RELEASE THE MONEY.

ASKING EVERYONE TO JUST,

HAVE BEEN WORKING TOO HARD

00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:17,037
BUT UNTIL THEN, YOU KNOW, 
I GOT BUSTER HERE TO HELP.

213

MICHAEL. 
MICHAEL.

216
00:08:32,261 --> 00:08:35,139

MAYBE I OUGHTA--

220
00:08:39,226 --> 00:08:41,562

222
00:08:43,438 --> 00:08:46,233
- WHAT'S BUSTY DOING HERE? 
- MICHAEL GOT ME THE JOB.

223
00:08:46,233 --> 00:08:48,193
- HOW DID YOU GET HIM 
TO DO CONSTRUCTION WORK?

224
00:08:48,193 --> 00:08:49,779
THE GUY'S, LIKE, 
THE WORLD'S BIGGEST CHICKEN.

[staccato cawing]

226
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:53,783
- I'M NOT A CHICKEN. 
- YEAH, HE'S NOT A CHICKEN.

227
00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:55,660
HE JUST DOESN'T LIKE 
CONFINED SPACES; THAT'S ALL.

228
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:56,952
- I THOUGHT IT WAS OPEN SPACES.

229
00:08:56,952 --> 00:08:59,705
- NO, IT'S BOTH, 
BUT I LOVE IT HERE.

230
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:03,793
AND THE LANGUAGE 
THESE GUYS USE--ROUGH!

231
00:09:03,793 --> 00:09:06,086
ONE OF THE GUYS TOLD ME

232
00:09:06,086 --> 00:09:07,171

YOU WANT YOUR PAYCHECK?

I USUALLY GET CASH 
UNDER THE TABLE,

238
00:09:16,931 --> 00:09:18,641
BUT IF YOU 
MADE IT OUT TO CASH--

239
00:09:18,641 --> 00:09:20,643

LINDSAY WAS TAKING OVER.

LETS GO TO LUNCH.

256
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,807
- WHAT HAPPENED TO THE LIGHTS? 
- ISN'T THIS BETTER?

257
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:01,934
DOESN'T THIS JUST 
WANNA MAKE YOU CURL UP

258
00:10:01,934 --> 00:10:03,352
AND FORGET ABOUT THE WORLD?

259
00:10:03,352 --> 00:10:05,896

SO THAT PEOPLE--

WHERE ARE THESE PEOPLE GOING?

262
00:10:09,692 --> 00:10:11,151

263
00:10:11,151 --> 00:10:12,653
ARE THEY TAKING THEIR OWN CARS?

264
00:10:12,653 --> 00:10:14,363
- OH, THEY'LL 
FIGURE SOMETHING OUT.

265
00:10:14,363 --> 00:10:16,490
- NO, THEY WON'T. 
YOU DON'T HAVE A PLAN?

266
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:18,033
I TOLD YOU, 
THESE PEOPLE ARE SHEEP.

267
00:10:18,033 --> 00:10:19,493
ALL RIGHT?

268
00:10:19,493 --> 00:10:21,662
AND THEY'LL WANDER OFF, 
AND YOU'LL LOSE THE SHEEP.

269
00:10:21,662 --> 00:10:22,705
YOU'VE LOST THE SHEEP.

270
00:10:22,705 --> 00:10:24,624

273
00:10:29,336 --> 00:10:33,007
THINKING LINDSAY HAD RESERVED IT 
TO TAKE THEM TO LUNCH.

274
00:10:33,007 --> 00:10:34,634

275
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:36,927
I DON'T KNOW HOW THEY CAN 
WALK OFF AND JUST--

276
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:38,012

YOU WEREN'T HERE,

278
00:10:39,179 --> 00:10:41,682

YOU REALLY THINK 
I COULD LEAVE HERE

282
00:10:46,228 --> 00:10:47,271
AND EVERYTHING WOULD BE FINE?

WOULD BE FINE BUT YOU.

284
00:10:49,273 --> 00:10:50,775
I DON'T THINK 
YOU CAN LEAVE.

285
00:10:50,775 --> 00:10:52,401

IF I DIDN'T HAVE THAT PHONE CALL

286
00:10:52,401 --> 00:10:53,653
FROM THE ZONING COMMITTEE--

287
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:54,904

288
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:57,907
I'LL HAVE IT FORWARDED 
TO YOUR CELL.

289
00:10:57,907 --> 00:11:00,951

NOT A PROBLEM.

290
00:11:00,951 --> 00:11:02,662
I, UH, CAN SPEND 
SOME TIME WITH MY SON.

291
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:03,913
SO YOU'RE IN CHARGE.

292
00:11:03,913 --> 00:11:05,455
TRY NOT TO BRING 
THE WHOLE COMPANY DOWN.

293
00:11:05,455 --> 00:11:07,624

LITTLE JUSTICE.

WE CALL YOU DAVID BEN-AVRAM?

304

PROVIDING HIM WITH OPTIONS.

IF YOU KEEP TRYING TO 
CONVERT MY TEAM.

311

HOLD IT, NOW.

WAIT, NOW, 
I'M DOING NO SUCH THING.

- OH, WE'RE STARTING.

334
00:12:40,425 --> 00:12:43,929
OH, YES. LET ME GET SOMETHING 
TO WRITE WITH.

335
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:45,430
narrator: 
BACK AT THE BANANA STAND,

336
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:46,974
ANNYONG HAD ARRIVED.

337
00:12:46,974 --> 00:12:48,642
- GUYS, IT LOOKS LIKE 
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO

338
00:12:48,642 --> 00:12:50,019
RESTOCK ON NUTS TONIGHT, 
ALL RIGHT?

339
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:51,395
NOW, LISTEN, 
I KNOW THAT THAT'S

340
00:12:51,395 --> 00:12:52,938
NOBODY'S FAVORITE 
SATURDAY NIGHT,

341
00:12:52,938 --> 00:12:54,815
BUT I THINK IF WE JUST 
POWER THROUGH

342
00:12:54,815 --> 00:12:56,817
AND KEEP OUR HEADS DOWN, 
WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO--

343
00:12:56,817 --> 00:12:58,318
- ANNYONG AND I ARE FINE HERE.

344
00:12:58,318 --> 00:12:59,528
I MEAN, YOU DON'T HAVE TO--

345
00:12:59,528 --> 00:13:01,071
- ANNYONG.

346
00:13:01,071 --> 00:13:03,490
- YOU DON'T HAVE TO 
WORRY SO MUCH.

347
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:05,200
I MEAN, OBVIOUSLY, 
YOUR DAD DOESN'T

348
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,326
WANT TO SPEND TIME WITH YOU,

349
00:13:06,326 --> 00:13:08,203
BUT, YOU KNOW, 
GO TO THE BEACH OR WHATEVER.

350
00:13:08,203 --> 00:13:10,205
YOU KNOW, 
HE'S JUST NOT AROUND, OKAY?

351
00:13:10,205 --> 00:13:11,790
- HE NO HAVE FATHER?

352
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:13,667
OLDER LADY ADOPT HIM TOO?

353
00:13:13,667 --> 00:13:16,753
- NO, HE HAVE FATHER. 
FATHER NO LOVE HIM.

354
00:13:16,753 --> 00:13:19,798
- NO, HE LOVE ME--LOVES ME. 
HE LOVES ME.

355
00:13:19,798 --> 00:13:21,383
SO, ALL RIGHT.

356
00:13:21,383 --> 00:13:23,343
MAYBE I WILL TAKE 
A LITTLE TIME OFF

357
00:13:23,343 --> 00:13:25,470
AND GO TO THE BEACH 
OR SOMETHING.

358
00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:26,889
- I WENT TO BEACH ONCE.

359
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:30,893
NEXT THING I KNOW, 
I'M IN CRATE NEXT TO PIG.

360
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:34,229
- [singing] YEE-HAW, 
GET ALONG

361
00:13:34,229 --> 00:13:35,564
narrator: INSTEAD, 
GEORGE MICHAEL

362
00:13:35,564 --> 00:13:37,399
HAD DECIDED TO LEAVE 
FOR HIS FATHER'S OFFICE

363
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:39,234
AND HAVE LUNCH WITH HIM.

364
00:13:39,234 --> 00:13:41,778
MEANWHILE, THE WHITE COLLAR 
BLUTH COMPANY EMPLOYEES

365
00:13:41,778 --> 00:13:44,239
HAD MADE IT THROUGH THE 
FIRST LEG OF THEIR JOURNEY

366
00:13:44,239 --> 00:13:47,952
AND WERE ABOUT TO 
EMBARK ON THE SECOND.

367
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:50,579
AND LUCILLE, 
TAKING MICHAEL'S ADVICE,

368
00:13:50,579 --> 00:13:53,540
RETURNED HOME FROM QUANTITY PLUS 
WITH A PROBLEM.

369
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:58,628
- LUPE! BUSTER?

370
00:13:58,628 --> 00:14:01,048
ANNYONG? HELLO?

371
00:14:01,048 --> 00:14:03,092
narrator: WITH LUPE GONE 
AND THE REST OF HER FAMILY

372
00:14:03,092 --> 00:14:06,678
WORKING FOR ONCE, LUCILLE 
REALIZED SHE MISSED THEM.

373
00:14:06,678 --> 00:14:10,933
- WELL, NOW, WHO THE HELL 
IS GONNA UNLOAD THE CAR?

374
00:14:10,933 --> 00:14:12,809
HOLA. IS ROSA STILL ALIVE?

375
00:14:12,809 --> 00:14:16,021
NO? HMM.

376
00:14:16,021 --> 00:14:19,233
OKAY. THIS IS NOT MY DAY.

377
00:14:22,402 --> 00:14:24,279
narrator: MICHAEL, MEANWHILE, 
STOPPED BY TO SAY HELLO

378
00:14:24,279 --> 00:14:26,406
TO HIS SON AND FOUND OUT 
HE HAD GONE TO THE BEACH.

379
00:14:26,406 --> 00:14:28,700
SO MICHAEL WENT 
TO FIND GEORGE MICHAEL

380
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:30,452
AND ALSO TRY TO 
FIGURE OUT A SOLUTION

381
00:14:30,452 --> 00:14:32,037
FOR HIS SPACE PROBLEM.

382
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:36,833
- [woman singing] AND I WONDER 
HOW LONG I'LL LAST

383
00:14:36,833 --> 00:14:39,378
narrator: AND THEN 
HE DECIDED THAT PERHAPS HE, TOO,

384
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:43,548
SHOULD TRY A LITTLE RELAXATION.

385
00:14:43,548 --> 00:14:45,217
BACK AT THE CONSTRUCTION SITE,

386
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:47,970
GOB WAS ALSO READY 
TO TAKE THE AFTERNOON OFF.

387
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:51,390
- SCREW THIS! 
I HAVE MY PRIDE.

388
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:53,976
I DON'T CARE 
HOW MUCH THEY'RE PAYING ME.

389
00:14:53,976 --> 00:14:55,310
- YOU GOT PAID?

390
00:14:55,310 --> 00:14:57,437
I THOUGHT WE WERE ALL 
MAKING SACRIFICES.

391
00:14:57,437 --> 00:14:59,398
- YEAH, WELL, MAYBE IT'S TIME 
FOR SOME OF THOSE BIG SHOTS

392
00:14:59,398 --> 00:15:02,859
AT THE BLUTH COMPANY 
TO START MAKING SOME SACRIFICES.

393
00:15:02,859 --> 00:15:04,945
I SAY WE 
SHUT DOWN CONSTRUCTION!

394
00:15:10,492 --> 00:15:12,912
- HEY, HEY, WHAT'S HAPPENING? 
WHY ARE WE STOPPING?

395
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:14,579
THIS IS FUN!

396
00:15:14,579 --> 00:15:16,331
WE SHOULD DO THIS 
JUST FOR THE FUN.

397
00:15:16,331 --> 00:15:19,626
- EASY FOR HIM TO SAY. 
HE GOT HIS PAYCHECK TOO.

398
00:15:19,626 --> 00:15:20,920
- UNBELIEVABLE. 
- THAT'S NOT RIGHT.

399
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:23,923
- COME ON, YOU DOUCHE BAGS. 
WE'RE ALL ON THE SAME TEAM!

400
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:26,758
- DON'T LISTEN TO HIM. 
HE'LL NEVER STAND UP TO THE MAN.

401
00:15:26,758 --> 00:15:29,511
- HE'S A CHICKEN, 
A CHICKEN.

402
00:15:29,511 --> 00:15:32,556
[staccato cawing]

403
00:15:32,556 --> 00:15:34,391
- MY WHOLE LIFE 
YOU'VE CALLED ME A CHICKEN,

404
00:15:34,391 --> 00:15:36,518
BUT THAT'S OVER NOW.

405
00:15:36,518 --> 00:15:38,062
I HAVE NOTHING TO PROVE.

406
00:15:38,062 --> 00:15:41,440
[staccato cawing and clapping]

407
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,358
- THAT IS NOT HOW 
A CHICKEN SOUNDS.

408
00:15:43,358 --> 00:15:44,443
CHICKENS DON'T CLAP!

409
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:45,860
CHICKENS DON'T CLAP!

410
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:47,237
- WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, 
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA!

411
00:15:47,237 --> 00:15:49,281
LISTEN, THIS IS NOT 
HOW WE SETTLE THINGS ON A SITE.

412
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:51,450
WE GOT OUR OWN WAY 
OF FINDING OUT WHO'S A CHICKEN

413
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:54,411
BY A LITTLE GAME 
WE LIKE TO CALL "CHICKEN."

414
00:15:55,829 --> 00:15:58,165
- I HOPE YOU'RE UP TO THIS, 
BUSTER.

415
00:15:58,165 --> 00:16:01,293
THIS IS A GAME OF COURAGE, 
A GAME FOR MEN.

416
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:04,879
- YEAH, WELL, 
IT'S A GAME I'M READY FOR!

417
00:16:05,005 --> 00:16:06,631
- UH-OH. 
MY SEAT DOESN'T HAVE A CUSHION.

418
00:16:06,631 --> 00:16:08,008
- READY? GO!

419
00:16:16,641 --> 00:16:18,435
OH, YEAH, I'M DEFINITELY 
GONNA NEED A CUSHION.

420
00:16:18,435 --> 00:16:20,187
narrator: AS THE BLUTHS 
SQUARED OFF,

421
00:16:20,187 --> 00:16:22,022
LINDSAY DEALT WITH 
THE NEWS OF THE WORK STOPPAGE.

422
00:16:22,022 --> 00:16:23,898
[elevator bell dings] 
- THIS WASN'T MY FAULT.

423
00:16:23,898 --> 00:16:26,026
I THOUGHT YOU WERE MICHAEL.

424
00:16:26,026 --> 00:16:27,319
- SO WAIT. 
MY DAD'S NOT HERE?

425
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:29,321
- NOPE. HE WENT OUT FOR LUNCH 
TO HAVE FUN.

426
00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:30,697
BUT EVERYTHING'S FINE.

427
00:16:30,697 --> 00:16:32,699
I MEAN, IF HE ASKS, 
EVERYTHING'S FINE.

428
00:16:32,699 --> 00:16:33,993
MY STYLE WORKS.

429
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:35,202
THIS PLACE IS HUMMING ALONG.

430
00:16:35,202 --> 00:16:38,163
thump!

431
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:39,414
- SO WAIT. 
MY DAD SAID THAT

432
00:16:39,414 --> 00:16:41,250
HE WAS WAITING FOR A CALL, 
THAT HE HAD TO STAY HERE.

433
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:42,876
- OH, NO, 
HE CAN GET THAT CALL ANYWHERE.

434
00:16:42,876 --> 00:16:44,503
I JUST HAVE TO 
FORWARD IT TO HIM.

435
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:45,754
- HUH.

436
00:16:45,754 --> 00:16:48,340
- HEY, WOULD YOU MIND RUNNING 
THINGS FOR A LITTLE WHILE?

437
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:49,966
- I'M--I'M NOT REALLY-- 
- IT'S NOT HARD.

438
00:16:49,966 --> 00:16:51,968
narrator: AND SO LINDSAY 
HEADED OFF TO DEAL

439
00:16:51,968 --> 00:16:54,554
WITH THE WORK STOPPAGE 
PROBLEM AT THE SITE.

440
00:16:54,554 --> 00:16:58,100
[telephone ringing]

441
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:00,060
LINDSAY KNEW MICHAEL 
WOULD BE FURIOUS

442
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:01,936
IF HE FOUND OUT 
THE BUILDING HAD STOPPED,

443
00:17:01,936 --> 00:17:04,023
SO SHE HAD TO FIND 
A WAY TO START IT,

444
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:06,066
AND THAT'S 
WHEN SHE SAW LUPE'S FAMILY.

445
00:17:06,066 --> 00:17:08,443
- HEY, WHO'S READY 
TO HAVE SOME FUN?

446
00:17:08,443 --> 00:17:10,195
- UH...

447
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:12,281
narrator: MEANWHILE, 
MICHAEL CONTINUED

448
00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:14,033
HIS RELAXATION AT THE BEACH.

449
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:15,617
- OKAY, THESE UNITS 
AREN'T TOO CLOSE TOGETHER.

450
00:17:15,617 --> 00:17:19,371
WE CAN GET AWAY WITH THIS, 
RIGHT, PEOPLE?

451
00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:21,123
ALL RIGHT. 
JUST SPEED IT UP.

452
00:17:21,123 --> 00:17:24,293
COME ON. KEEP YOUR HEADS DOWN. 
POWER THROUGH.

453
00:17:24,293 --> 00:17:25,960
[phone ringing]

454
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:28,004
OH, NO. WHERE IS-- 
WHERE'S MY PHONE?

455
00:17:28,004 --> 00:17:30,049
- I USED IT 
TO DIG THE "B" UNIT.

456
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:32,509
- YOU WHAT? 
- I'LL GET IT.

457
00:17:32,509 --> 00:17:34,969
- NO, NO. 
YOU'RE GONNA RUIN IT!

458
00:17:34,969 --> 00:17:35,970
WHAT AM I DOING?

459
00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:38,682
[ringing continues]

460
00:17:38,682 --> 00:17:39,683
HELLO.

461
00:17:39,683 --> 00:17:40,684
- HI, DAD.

462
00:17:40,684 --> 00:17:41,976
- HEY, GEORGE MICHAEL, 
WHERE ARE YOU?

463
00:17:41,976 --> 00:17:42,977
I'M AT THE OFFICE.

464
00:17:42,977 --> 00:17:45,314
LINDSAY PUT ME IN CHARGE HERE 
'CAUSE THERE WAS NOBODY HERE,

465
00:17:45,314 --> 00:17:47,107
AND SHE HAD TO GO 
TO THE CONSTRUCTION SITE,

466
00:17:47,107 --> 00:17:48,858
'CAUSE THE WORKERS 
STOPPED WORKING.

467
00:17:48,858 --> 00:17:50,277
- OH, GREAT. 
NOW WE'RE NEVER GONNA

468
00:17:50,277 --> 00:17:52,571
FINISH PHASE THREE, AND 
EVERYTHING'S GONNA FALL APART.

469
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:54,656
THIS WHOLE THING 
IS GONNA CAVE IN,

470
00:17:54,656 --> 00:17:58,285
AND WE'RE GONNA 
BE LEFT WITH A BUNCH OF--

471
00:17:58,285 --> 00:18:00,204
GREAT.

472
00:18:00,204 --> 00:18:03,373
NOW MY SAND CASTLE 
HAS A GIANT POOL IN IT.

473
00:18:03,373 --> 00:18:06,085
narrator: AND THAT'S WHEN 
MICHAEL SAW THE SOLUTION

474
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:07,377
TO HIS SPACE PROBLEM.

475
00:18:07,377 --> 00:18:10,130
- I GOTTA GO, BUDDY.

476
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:14,718
- HE'S MAKING A SAND CASTLE?

477
00:18:14,718 --> 00:18:16,970
narrator: GEORGE MICHAEL 
NOTICED SOMETHING TOO.

478
00:18:25,145 --> 00:18:27,021
HE KNEW HIS FATHER 
HAD ALWAYS LOVED HIM,

479
00:18:27,021 --> 00:18:28,107
BUT AT THIS MOMENT,

480
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:32,194
HE WAS ACTUALLY 
HOLDING THE PROOF IN HIS HANDS.

481
00:18:32,194 --> 00:18:34,446
UNFORTUNATELY, 
IT WAS AT THIS MOMENT

482
00:18:34,446 --> 00:18:36,490
THAT THE INVESTIGATORS 
WENT INTO ACTION.

483
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:37,866
- THERE'S THE KID.

484
00:18:37,866 --> 00:18:38,908
- COVER'S BLOWN. 
GET OUT.

485
00:18:38,908 --> 00:18:40,244
- I'VE GOT 
A CLEAN SHOT OVER HERE.

486
00:18:40,244 --> 00:18:41,453
- NO, NO, 
GET THE PROOF.

487
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:43,663
HE'S GOT THE EVIDENCE FILE.

488
00:18:43,663 --> 00:18:45,249
- COME ON. COME ON.

489
00:18:45,249 --> 00:18:47,167
I TOLD YOU 
TO FIND A STUD. GO!

490
00:18:58,345 --> 00:19:00,222
narrator: AND BACK 
AT THE CONSTRUCTION SITE,

491
00:19:00,222 --> 00:19:01,598
BUSTER AND GOB'S SHOWDOWN

492
00:19:01,598 --> 00:19:04,643
WAS REACHING 
A DRAMATIC CONCLUSION.

493
00:19:04,643 --> 00:19:08,730
- [whimpering]

494
00:19:09,773 --> 00:19:10,815
ding!

495
00:19:10,815 --> 00:19:13,818
- WOW. 
WHO WON?

496
00:19:13,818 --> 00:19:15,154
narrator: 
AND FOR THE FIRST TIME,

497
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:17,739
GOB SAW HIS BROTHER AS A MAN.

498
00:19:17,739 --> 00:19:22,702
- LET'S GET BACK TO WORK, GUYS.

499
00:19:22,702 --> 00:19:24,996
narrator: AND LINDSAY ARRIVED,

500
00:19:24,996 --> 00:19:28,917
SUDDENLY TRYING 
A NEW MANAGEMENT STYLE.

501
00:19:28,917 --> 00:19:30,419
- WHAT'S THIS NOW? 
- OKAY.

502
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:32,754
SO YOU GUYS 
DON'T WANNA WORK? FINE.

503
00:19:32,754 --> 00:19:34,256
I'VE GOT A STAIR CAR 
FULL OF MEXICAN LABORERS

504
00:19:34,256 --> 00:19:35,382
THAT WOULD LOVE A DAY'S WORK.

505
00:19:35,382 --> 00:19:36,466
- "LABORERS"?

506
00:19:36,466 --> 00:19:38,051
I'M A PROFESSOR 
OF AMERICAN STUDIES

507
00:19:38,051 --> 00:19:40,429
AT THE UNIVERSITY 
OF MEXICO CITY.

508
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:42,972
- I TOOK A DANCE CLASS THERE.

509
00:19:42,972 --> 00:19:44,766
- I THOUGHT YOU WERE TAKING US 
TO CATALINA.

510
00:19:44,766 --> 00:19:46,810
WHAT HAPPENED TO CATALINA?

511
00:19:48,478 --> 00:19:51,190
- [singing] YEE-HAW

512
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:52,982
- YOU'D BRING IN SCABS, 
JUST LIKE THAT?

513
00:19:52,982 --> 00:19:56,152
- WATCH ME. 
GO TO WORK!

514
00:19:56,152 --> 00:19:57,612
- WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, 
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

515
00:19:57,612 --> 00:19:58,613
WE'RE SHUTTING IT DOWN.

516
00:19:58,613 --> 00:20:00,490
- MICHAEL, I'VE SOLVED THIS. 
- NO, NO, IT'S NOT YOU.

517
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:02,534
IT'S ME. IT'S WRONG. 
THE PLAN IS WRONG.

518
00:20:02,534 --> 00:20:04,911
WE GOTTA GET RID OF 
THE INDIVIDUAL SWIMMING POOLS

519
00:20:04,911 --> 00:20:06,663
AND PUT IN A GREAT BIG 
COMMUNAL ONE

520
00:20:06,663 --> 00:20:08,207
RIGHT IN THE CENTER.

521
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:09,583
AND, LINDSAY, YOU WERE RIGHT.

522
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:11,626
WE'VE ALL BEEN WORKING 
A LITTLE BIT TOO HARD.

523
00:20:11,626 --> 00:20:14,045
YOU CAN'T MANAGE BY THREATENING 
AND PUSHING PEOPLE,

524
00:20:14,045 --> 00:20:16,340
AND SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO 
REWARD HARD WORK.

525
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:17,674
MAYBE REWARD IT WITH A PARTY.

526
00:20:17,674 --> 00:20:18,967
[cheering]

527
00:20:18,967 --> 00:20:20,302
RIGHT. 
I DIDN'T MEAN TONIGHT,

528
00:20:20,302 --> 00:20:21,386
JUST SOME TIME IN THE FUTURE

529
00:20:21,386 --> 00:20:23,305
WHEN WE HAVE 
SOME EXTRA FOOD AND LIQUOR.

530
00:20:23,305 --> 00:20:24,681
- LUPE!

531
00:20:24,681 --> 00:20:29,561
LUPE, I NEED HELP 
WITH THE GROCERIES!

532
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:31,688
- HOW ABOUT JUST LIQUOR?

533
00:20:31,688 --> 00:20:33,732
narrator: AND THE TWO BLUTH MEN 
FINALLY DID RELAX.

534
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:34,816
- THANKS FOR COMING OUT, BUDDY.

535
00:20:34,816 --> 00:20:36,276
I'VE BEEN DYING 
TO GET SOME TIME WITH YOU,

536
00:20:36,276 --> 00:20:37,444
I REALLY HAVE.

537
00:20:37,444 --> 00:20:38,570
- THAT'S OKAY.

538
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:40,071
I KNOW HOW MUCH 
YOU CARE ABOUT ME.

539
00:20:40,071 --> 00:20:42,282
UNFORTUNATELY, 
SO DOES THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.

540
00:20:42,282 --> 00:20:45,994
WANT MORE PUNCH? 
- SURE.

541
00:20:45,994 --> 00:20:48,162
WAIT. THE FEDS?

542
00:20:48,162 --> 00:20:50,415
narrator: ON THE NEXT 
"ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT."

543
00:20:50,415 --> 00:20:52,459
TOBIAS GETS AN INSIGHT 
INTO FEAR.

544
00:20:52,459 --> 00:20:54,794
- WELL, LET'S DISCUSS 
THIS BUNKING SITUATION.

545
00:20:54,794 --> 00:20:56,713
- YOU'LL BE SLEEPING 
UNDER ME FOR A WHILE.

546
00:20:56,713 --> 00:21:01,009
- I SOLD YOU 
FOR A PACK OF CIGARETTES.

547
00:21:01,009 --> 00:21:02,761
narrator: AND THE EMPLOYEES 
FIND A NEW DIRECTION.

548
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:03,845
- WHOA! WHOA!

549
00:21:03,845 --> 00:21:06,055
WHAT ARE YOU FOLKS DOIN' 
ON THIS PART OF THE MOUNTAIN?

550
00:21:06,055 --> 00:21:07,307
- WE'RE LOST.

551
00:21:07,307 --> 00:21:09,017
- WELL, I CAN GIVE YOU 
A RIDE BACK INTO TOWN.

552
00:21:09,017 --> 00:21:10,269
COME ON. LET'S GO.

553
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:12,186
BUCK, BANJO, 
GET ON UP HERE. COME ON, BOY.

554
00:21:12,186 --> 00:21:13,647
[yipping]

555
00:21:13,647 --> 00:21:15,315
THERE YOU GO.

556
00:21:15,315 --> 00:21:16,941
- [singing] 
GET ALONG
