one of our members

You must be mistaken,

as hard to miss

BARRY: First of all,
won't be cheap.

It's gonna cost you a fortune

<i>Correction:</i>
<i>good news for Barry.</i>

78
00:03:16,667 --> 00:03:18,000
unless we can come up
with a good alibi.

79
00:03:18,041 --> 00:03:21,208
Ma! I fell in the ocean;
why didn't you come for me?

80
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:22,542
And there it is.

81
00:03:22,583 --> 00:03:23,583
-What?
-I did.

82
00:03:23,625 --> 00:03:24,834
-Buster...
-What?

83
00:03:24,875 --> 00:03:26,333
...tell them
how you were drowning

84
00:03:26,375 --> 00:03:27,834
and I commandeered the ship
to save you.

85
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:28,917
Tell them what I did.

86
00:03:30,333 --> 00:03:31,959
-The truth.
-Okay.

87
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,834
She stole the "Queen Mary "
to get away from the SEC.

88
00:03:34,875 --> 00:03:36,875
Oh, and she winked.

89
00:03:36,917 --> 00:03:40,333
Correction: it's a glare.
(chuckles)

90
00:03:40,375 --> 00:03:41,458
-Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
-Oh, God.

91
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:42,458
-Hey!
-What are you doing?

92
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:43,709
Wait, wh-where you going?

93
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:44,917
Wait, she doesn't
have her make--

94
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:46,417
I have her lipstick!

95
00:03:46,458 --> 00:03:48,333
<i>But Buster knew that lipstick</i>

96
00:03:48,375 --> 00:03:50,750
<i>wasn't the only thing</i>
<i>she'd be without.</i>

97
00:03:50,792 --> 00:03:55,667
<i>So, after she was released to</i>
<i>await trial under house arrest,</i>

98
00:03:55,709 --> 00:03:59,333
<i>he made sure she was able</i>
<i>to catch up on what she missed.</i>

99
00:03:59,375 --> 00:04:01,500
This is the same scene
I came back to

100
00:04:01,542 --> 00:04:04,417
after Cancun four years ago.

101
00:04:04,458 --> 00:04:08,500
<i>And after devising their plan</i>
<i>to build the wall,</i>

102
00:04:08,542 --> 00:04:11,583
<i>it was decided that</i>
<i>George Sr. should move out,</i>

103
00:04:11,625 --> 00:04:14,583
<i>in order to make</i>
<i>their fake divorce look real.</i>

104
00:04:14,625 --> 00:04:16,583
After the trial,
you can move back in.

105
00:04:16,625 --> 00:04:19,333
It's only a trial separation.

106
00:04:19,375 --> 00:04:21,500
(laughs):
I made a pun.

107
00:04:21,542 --> 00:04:22,500
(chuckles)

108
00:04:22,542 --> 00:04:24,750
Even in this time of stress.

109
00:04:24,792 --> 00:04:27,333
You think you're gonna be okay,
alone with Buster?

110
00:04:27,375 --> 00:04:29,542
If I need a moment to myself,
I'll step out on the balcony.

111
00:04:29,583 --> 00:04:31,291
Your ankle bracelet--
it's gonna go off.

112
00:04:31,333 --> 00:04:32,917
So I'll make him
stand on the balcony.

113
00:04:32,959 --> 00:04:36,500
He's happiest
when he feels useful.

114
00:04:36,542 --> 00:04:38,959
Soon, he was
practically delirious.

115
00:04:40,792 --> 00:04:41,834
(Buster sobs)

116
00:04:41,875 --> 00:04:43,834
<i>There was one bright spot</i>

117
00:04:43,875 --> 00:04:45,834

120

MAN (on TV): ...I'm covered

123
00:04:56,417 --> 00:04:58,792
this is a hot mess!

00:04:58,834 --> 00:05:00,542
(mouthing)

125
00:05:00,583 --> 00:05:03,875
<i>But as her trial grew closer,</i>
<i>it was getting harder</i>

126
00:05:03,917 --> 00:05:07,375
<i>for Lucille</i>
<i>not to alienate her alibi.</i>

127
00:05:07,417 --> 00:05:10,083
This toast has hook holes...

128
00:05:10,125 --> 00:05:13,417
...again! I told you to get rid
of that thing; it's hideous.

129
00:05:13,458 --> 00:05:15,875
Plus, what's gonna happen
when they swear you in?

130
00:05:15,917 --> 00:05:17,792
You're gonna
rip the Bible in half.

131
00:05:17,834 --> 00:05:19,166
The jury will love that.

132
00:05:19,208 --> 00:05:22,542
You're getting pretty snippy

133
00:05:22,583 --> 00:05:24,083
to your key witness, aren't you?

134
00:05:24,125 --> 00:05:25,750
What do you want?

135
00:05:25,792 --> 00:05:29,208
Maybe you could hook me up
with a little stimmy.

136
00:05:31,208 --> 00:05:33,500
Lil' stimmy.

137
00:05:33,542 --> 00:05:34,583
Are you trying to do this?

138
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:36,375
Yes!

139
00:05:36,417 --> 00:05:38,208
And I want stimmy
to get a hook that'll do that.

140
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:40,041
<i>When no such hook</i>
<i>was available,</i>

141
00:05:40,083 --> 00:05:43,834
<i>Lucille found other means</i>
<i>to mollify her alibi--</i>

142
00:05:43,875 --> 00:05:47,000
<i>both of which were unveiled</i>
<i>at a family meeting.</i>

143
00:05:47,041 --> 00:05:49,458
...you're the key witness
in your mother's trial.

144
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:51,125
Wait, I thought
I was the key witness.

145
00:05:51,166 --> 00:05:52,750
-You're the star witness.
-Oh.

146
00:05:52,792 --> 00:05:55,583
Because it was your life
I was going after to save.

147
00:05:55,625 --> 00:05:57,083
He fell off the boat.

148
00:05:57,125 --> 00:05:59,083
-He'll tell you in my own words.
-(groans)

149
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:00,625
(mumbles):
Homosexuals kidnapped...

150
00:06:00,667 --> 00:06:03,083
Up-up-up.

151
00:06:03,125 --> 00:06:05,083
(loudly):
Homosexuals kidnapped the boat

152
00:06:05,125 --> 00:06:07,000
and took it on a joy ride.

153
00:06:07,041 --> 00:06:08,834
Mother didn't want to trample
their rights, so she let them.

154
00:06:08,875 --> 00:06:10,458
Then she realized
that her son fell

155
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,667
off the boat and into the water,
and she went back.

156
00:06:12,709 --> 00:06:14,667
Oh, and a fish swam by my ankle.

157
00:06:14,709 --> 00:06:16,208
(gasps)
That really happened.

158
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:17,542
Should I keep that?

159
00:06:17,583 --> 00:06:18,875
-Make it an eel.
-Okay.

160
00:06:18,917 --> 00:06:20,792
-It's gonna be an eel!
-Better.

161
00:06:20,834 --> 00:06:23,917
<i>But alone with Buster,</i>
<i>the tension grew worse,</i>

162
00:06:23,959 --> 00:06:27,709

163
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:29,166
Buster, I'm going to exhale!

164
00:06:29,208 --> 00:06:30,959
No, please!

165
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,750
I've had, like, seven
in the past half hour.

166
00:06:33,792 --> 00:06:36,500
You're not the one
staring five years in the face.

167
00:06:36,542 --> 00:06:39,291
Well, right now, I'm staring at
a hundred years in the face!

168
00:06:39,333 --> 00:06:41,041
(whispers):
How dare you.

169
00:06:41,083 --> 00:06:44,542
Would you mind?

170
00:06:44,583 --> 00:06:46,709
Be careful, defendant.

171
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:49,667
Remember who you're talking to.

172
00:06:49,709 --> 00:06:51,917
It sure would be a shame
if something happened

173
00:06:51,959 --> 00:06:54,166
to your pretty little
key witness.

174
00:06:54,208 --> 00:06:56,542
Star witness.

175
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:58,625
And are you
threatening yourself?

176
00:06:58,667 --> 00:07:00,125
Maybe I am.

177
00:07:00,166 --> 00:07:04,291
<i>And losing confidence</i>
<i>in her star witness,</i>

178
00:07:04,333 --> 00:07:06,709
<i>Lucille decided to take</i>
<i>a few keepsakes with her,</i>

179
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:10,291
<i>in case things didn't</i>
<i>go her way.</i>

180
00:07:11,667 --> 00:07:13,208
<i>And that's when she discovered</i>

181
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:15,667
<i>that the family</i>
<i>she believed supported her</i>

182
00:07:15,709 --> 00:07:18,500
<i>had actually already begun</i>
<i>divvying up her stuff,</i>

183
00:07:18,542 --> 00:07:19,625
<i>in case she lost.</i>

184
00:07:21,959 --> 00:07:23,250
Aw...

185
00:07:23,291 --> 00:07:25,625
And he's supposed to be
the good one.

186
00:07:25,667 --> 00:07:28,625
This does not bode well
for tomorrow.

187
00:07:28,667 --> 00:07:31,208
<i>Actually, they'd claimed</i>
<i>those things years earlier</i>

188
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:34,000
<i>when she was having</i>
<i>a sunspot checked.</i>

189
00:07:34,041 --> 00:07:35,583
<i>But she was right</i>
<i>to worry about</i>

190
00:07:35,625 --> 00:07:37,166
<i>the turnout for the trial.</i>

191
00:07:37,208 --> 00:07:40,041
Does the defense have a witness
they'd like to call?!

192
00:07:40,083 --> 00:07:41,750
Any witness?

193
00:07:41,792 --> 00:07:43,750
Please tell me you're working on
a strategy for us.

194
00:07:43,792 --> 00:07:45,917
Oh. It's us now?

195
00:07:45,959 --> 00:07:48,208
Well, we have Lucille Austero.

196
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:49,750
She's the only one who showed.

197
00:07:49,792 --> 00:07:51,709
I don't think
that is good for us.

198
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:52,875
Nonsense.

199
00:07:52,917 --> 00:07:54,333
-She owns the company now.
-Mm-hmm.

200
00:07:54,375 --> 00:07:56,542
She's got as much to lose
as I do.

201
00:07:56,583 --> 00:07:58,166
And she's a dear friend.

202
00:07:58,208 --> 00:07:59,750
I'll do it myself though.

203
00:07:59,792 --> 00:08:01,333
I need this to go well.

204
00:08:01,375 --> 00:08:04,667
<i>And so it was Lucille</i>
<i>who did the questioning</i>

205
00:08:04,709 --> 00:08:07,250
<i>of her new star witness,</i>
<i>Lucille 2.</i>

206
00:08:07,291 --> 00:08:09,834
Thank you so much
for coming to be my witness.

207
00:08:09,875 --> 00:08:11,959
You're such
a large shareholder...

208
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,667
Oh...

209
00:08:13,709 --> 00:08:15,291
(chuckles):
I've made a pun.

210
00:08:15,333 --> 00:08:18,583
Oh, how could I not do it
for my oldest friend?

211
00:08:18,625 --> 00:08:19,750
Oh!

212
00:08:19,792 --> 00:08:22,000
Now I've gone and done a double.

213
00:08:22,041 --> 00:08:23,166
(laughs):
A double.

214
00:08:23,208 --> 00:08:24,917
Like your pre-surgery chin.

215
00:08:24,959 --> 00:08:26,667
Or your post-breakfast drink.

216
00:08:26,709 --> 00:08:29,792
Oh, I wish you'd come
to my rehab clinic.

217
00:08:29,834 --> 00:08:32,792
But anything to help that
Keystone Cop family of yours.

218
00:08:32,834 --> 00:08:34,208
Keystone Cops.

219
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:36,792
Your references are as fresh
as the wallpaper

220
00:08:36,834 --> 00:08:38,667
in the room
of that pretend child

221
00:08:38,709 --> 00:08:40,458
you've had all these years.

222
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,458
-But, my friend...
-You're right, I shouldn't joke.

223
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:45,250
None of your family showed up,
you poor thing.

224
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:47,875
This is such a black mark
on all of you.

225
00:08:47,917 --> 00:08:49,834
You should know
about black marks.

226
00:08:49,875 --> 00:08:52,083
Your pillow must look like
a Rorschach test.

227
00:08:52,125 --> 00:08:54,667
(chuckles): Not that there'd be
anyone to see it.

228
00:08:54,709 --> 00:08:56,333
So, as I was saying...

229
00:08:56,375 --> 00:08:57,959
<i>But unfortunately,</i>

230
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,208
<i>their 30-year</i>
<i>passive-aggressive dance</i>

231
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:02,125
<i>was losing some of its passive.</i>

232
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:04,125
As if everybody in this room
couldn't tell

233
00:09:04,166 --> 00:09:07,875
how jealous and conniving you
are, my dear Lucille Austero.

234
00:09:07,917 --> 00:09:11,750
What I knew was that you were
stealing for years-- we all did!

235
00:09:11,792 --> 00:09:14,417
That's why nobody was surprised
when you stole that boat.

236
00:09:14,458 --> 00:09:15,917
And I knew you couldn't wait

237
00:09:15,959 --> 00:09:18,458
to get your liver-spotted claws
into my company!

238
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,875
Says the woman whose liver
can be spotted from outer space.

239
00:09:20,917 --> 00:09:23,041
-No further questions!
-No further answers!

240
00:09:23,083 --> 00:09:24,458
Am I done?

241
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:28,291
Oh, that's got to be
a treasure chest.

242
00:09:28,333 --> 00:09:29,667
You think that went well?

243
00:09:29,709 --> 00:09:31,667
BARRY:
I do.

244
00:09:31,709 --> 00:09:34,417
<i>The judge kept Lucille on ice</i>
<i>while she awaited the verdict.</i>

245
00:09:34,458 --> 00:09:36,375
Have you heard anything?

246
00:09:36,417 --> 00:09:39,917
Well, our cashier's pregnant,
and she's not married, so...

247
00:09:39,959 --> 00:09:41,333
I mean about me.

248
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:43,208
Oh, you're guilty--
three to five.

249
00:09:52,375 --> 00:09:54,875
<i>Lucille was</i>
<i>checking in to her new home.</i>

250
00:09:54,917 --> 00:09:57,959
Hello! Oh, Mrs. Bluth is here,
for stealing the "Queen Mary."

251
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,875
-We're so glad to have you here.
<i>-It was one of the so-called</i>

252
00:10:00,917 --> 00:10:01,875
<i>country club prisons...</i>

253
00:10:01,917 --> 00:10:04,125
So... you are here.

254
00:10:04,166 --> 00:10:06,875
<i>...that had become popular</i>
<i>after the Enron debacle.</i>

255
00:10:06,917 --> 00:10:08,291
...so you're gonna take
this hallway to the elevators,

256
00:10:08,333 --> 00:10:09,417
and then you're gonna
want to go...

257
00:10:09,458 --> 00:10:11,083
Slow down.

258
00:10:11,125 --> 00:10:13,083
You sound like the end
of a Cymbalta commercial.

259
00:10:13,125 --> 00:10:15,208
Even the lifers get confused.
Don't worry...

260
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:18,083
<i>Even though it was a nice</i>
<i>prison, it was still prison.</i>

261
00:10:18,125 --> 00:10:19,333
...your choice of
fresh scent, sport,

262
00:10:19,375 --> 00:10:21,041
or floral for your delousing.

263
00:10:21,083 --> 00:10:23,458
Also, if you're
sexually assaulted by a guard...

264
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:26,166
A $20 gratuity is appreciated?

265
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:27,458
(laughs)

266
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:29,959
No, but press seven
on your phone.

267
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,542
If you go through the front
desk, it'll take forever.

268
00:10:32,583 --> 00:10:35,917
<i>After Lucille got settled in,</i>
<i>she received a visitor.</i>

269
00:10:35,959 --> 00:10:37,125
LUCILLE:
You missed my trial, George.

270
00:10:37,166 --> 00:10:38,333
How could you?

271
00:10:38,375 --> 00:10:40,125
GEORGE SR.:
I told you I was sorry.

272
00:10:40,166 --> 00:10:41,834
I was unconscious
on the sweat lodge floor.

273
00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:42,917
I lost two days.

274
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:44,417
I'm losing three to five years.

275
00:10:44,458 --> 00:10:46,875
And those are the last years,
George, the best years,

276
00:10:46,917 --> 00:10:49,083
where you can have sex and not
worry about getting pregnant.

277
00:10:49,125 --> 00:10:50,417
All right, here's the good news:

278
00:10:50,458 --> 00:10:52,166
they only got you
on stealing the boat.

279
00:10:52,208 --> 00:10:54,208
They didn't even touch us
on the financial stuff.

280
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:56,250
-You're gonna get out of here.
-When?

281
00:10:56,291 --> 00:10:58,583
Better be before the money runs
out; this place isn't cheap.

282
00:10:58,625 --> 00:11:01,834
I know, and you are
running up those spa bills.

283
00:11:01,875 --> 00:11:04,834
The same girl who hands me
towels does the cavity checks.

284
00:11:04,875 --> 00:11:06,333
You tip.

285
00:11:06,375 --> 00:11:08,792
Barry says he can get your
sentence reduced if...

286
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:12,083
you agree to leave here
and go to Lucille 2's

287
00:11:12,125 --> 00:11:13,583
rehab clinic.

288
00:11:13,625 --> 00:11:16,375
That's the bitch
that put me here.

289
00:11:16,417 --> 00:11:19,375
And I'm not gonna fake having
some sort of...

290
00:11:19,417 --> 00:11:21,041
I don't know-- alcohol problem--

291
00:11:21,083 --> 00:11:23,500
just so that sterile cuckoo bird
can laugh at me.

292
00:11:23,542 --> 00:11:25,250
I figured. Okay.

293
00:11:25,291 --> 00:11:28,000
I have another idea--
now, you know China Garden?

294
00:11:28,041 --> 00:11:29,208
I know the one by the harbor.

295
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:30,208
No, this one's a person.

296
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:31,458
And that one closed.

297
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:34,083
China Garden's Aunt Olive

298
00:11:34,125 --> 00:11:36,458
is very well connected
with the Jade Triad Gang.

299
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:37,875
It's a prison gang here.

300
00:11:37,917 --> 00:11:39,834
And believe me,
they will protect you.

301
00:11:39,875 --> 00:11:41,917
That's a gang?

302
00:11:41,959 --> 00:11:45,000
I thought they were
tech support.

303
00:11:45,041 --> 00:11:46,542
<i>It turned out</i>
<i>they were a gang.</i>

304
00:11:46,583 --> 00:11:48,417
<i>And thanks to China Garden,</i>

305
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:51,041
<i>Lucille was admitted</i>
<i>as a probationary member.</i>

306
00:11:51,083 --> 00:11:52,834
You play mahjong before?

307
00:11:52,875 --> 00:11:54,917
Our beach club used
to have a Jewish Day.

308
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:56,041
Your move, Olive Garden.

309
00:11:56,083 --> 00:11:57,625
I can't concentrate.

310
00:11:57,667 --> 00:12:00,083
Playing mahjong
without cigarette is like

311
00:12:00,125 --> 00:12:02,125
playing video poker without...

312
00:12:02,166 --> 00:12:03,125
cigarette.

313
00:12:03,166 --> 00:12:05,083
Why are we not allowed to smoke

314
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:06,875
in this stupid prison?

315
00:12:06,917 --> 00:12:09,583
<i>And that's</i>
<i>when Lucille made her move.</i>

316
00:12:09,625 --> 00:12:12,458
-I know a loophole.
-Huh?

317
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:13,875
"Roop hore"?

318
00:12:13,917 --> 00:12:15,500
-Roop hore.
-Roop hore.

319
00:12:15,542 --> 00:12:17,875
<i>It was a loophole</i>
<i>that would get Lucille</i>

320
00:12:17,917 --> 00:12:20,125
<i>accepted as</i>
<i>a full-fledged member</i>

321
00:12:20,166 --> 00:12:22,875
<i>member of</i>
<i>the Jade Dragon Triad.</i>

322
00:12:22,917 --> 00:12:24,375
You couldn't have chosen
a harder word to say.

323
00:12:27,041 --> 00:12:29,458
<i>And soon</i>
<i>the Dragons were taking</i>

324
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:31,625
<i>"drags on"</i>
<i>their cigarettes again.</i>

325
00:12:31,667 --> 00:12:33,709
There's always a way
to get what you want.

326
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:37,959
My husband is a very
powerful man, Lucille Bluth.

327
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,041
Perhaps we can help each other
get what we want.

328
00:12:41,083 --> 00:12:44,250
<i>And that's how Lucille found</i>
<i>a deep-pocketed investor</i>

329
00:12:44,291 --> 00:12:46,166
<i>to help build the wall.</i>

330
00:12:46,208 --> 00:12:49,667
I got Olive Garden
to offer us unlimited bread.

331
00:12:49,709 --> 00:12:52,709
Who better than the Chinese
to help us build a wall, right?

332
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:55,583
So the Chinese will own
a piece of the wall

333
00:12:55,625 --> 00:12:57,250
between U.S. and Mexico?

334
00:12:57,291 --> 00:12:59,000
They'll own all of it,
but they'll make us

335
00:12:59,041 --> 00:13:01,000
very rich in the process.

336
00:13:01,041 --> 00:13:03,500
We just need to get Michael
to sign a release.

337
00:13:03,542 --> 00:13:05,375
He sold his shares,
but he could still claim

338
00:13:05,417 --> 00:13:06,709
that he deserves a piece.

339
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:09,375
Or worse, find out
and blow the whistle.

340
00:13:09,417 --> 00:13:11,375
Where the hell did we go wrong
with that kid?

341
00:13:11,417 --> 00:13:14,041
Probably where we went wrong
with the others-- I don't know.

342
00:13:14,083 --> 00:13:17,125
I like the plan... I just wonder

343
00:13:17,166 --> 00:13:19,500
if we're not in that
treason-adjacent place

344
00:13:19,542 --> 00:13:21,959
where the, uh,
government will retaliate

345
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
and, uh... execute us.

346
00:13:24,041 --> 00:13:26,709
LUCILLE: Oh, they'd never
execute a woman for this.

347
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:29,542
I have a good feeling
about these people.

348
00:13:29,583 --> 00:13:31,458
Oh, that's good enough for me.

349
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,291
-(George crying)
<i>-But the change in the economy</i>

350
00:13:33,333 --> 00:13:36,625

351
00:13:36,667 --> 00:13:38,166
<i>And as the months passed</i>

352
00:13:38,208 --> 00:13:40,500
<i>and the Chinese saw</i>
<i>no progress on the wall,</i>

353
00:13:40,542 --> 00:13:42,041
<i>tension mounted.</i>

354
00:13:42,083 --> 00:13:44,750
<i>And Lucille was getting</i>
<i>more controlling.</i>

355
00:13:44,792 --> 00:13:46,041
She said you're fat.

356
00:13:46,083 --> 00:13:47,625
That's what you said, right?

357
00:13:47,667 --> 00:13:49,125
Or does that mean something

358
00:13:49,166 --> 00:13:51,792
-different in Chinese?
-No, it means "fat."

359
00:13:51,834 --> 00:13:53,500
You keep causing trouble,
you're going to end up

360
00:13:53,542 --> 00:13:56,166
-with noodles in your belly.
-I like noodles.

361
00:13:56,208 --> 00:13:59,000
Not this way--
very hard to digest.

362
00:13:59,041 --> 00:14:00,625
Ancient Chinese secret, huh?

363
00:14:00,667 --> 00:14:02,417
It's no secret--
we'll kill you.

364
00:14:02,458 --> 00:14:04,458
<i>-She was even being controlling</i>

367
00:14:08,583 --> 00:14:10,250
Do you need a clean of
her making the threat?

368
00:14:10,291 --> 00:14:11,750
I can lean back,
but you will come around

369
00:14:11,792 --> 00:14:13,500
and get my reaction, yes?

370
00:14:13,542 --> 00:14:16,041
Oh, I'll say it again--
we'll kill you.

371
00:14:16,083 --> 00:14:18,333
<i>But soon</i>

372
00:14:18,375 --> 00:14:20,750
Oh!
She's got a sharpened noodle!

373
00:14:20,792 --> 00:14:22,667
She's trying to noodle-stab me!

374
00:14:22,709 --> 00:14:24,166
-Back up!

Aah, my eye!

379
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:34,208
This will be even more
exciting if you jump cut it.

380
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:36,041
Quiet!

381
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:40,291
You can't just come in and have
bread for nothing around here.

382
00:14:40,333 --> 00:14:43,125
You have to pay bill some time.

383
00:14:43,166 --> 00:14:45,834
<i>It wasn't a great time to find</i>

385
00:14:48,834 --> 00:14:51,583
<i>-And so a new plan emerged</i>
-LUCILLE: Make sure Hebert Love

386
00:14:51,625 --> 00:14:53,417
comes out against the wall...

387
00:14:53,458 --> 00:14:57,083
<i>They needed the government</i>
<i>to kill the wall completely,</i>

388
00:14:57,125 --> 00:14:58,583
<i>-but pay them anyway.</i>
-As much as I'd like to stay

389
00:14:58,625 --> 00:14:59,875
and lay some more pipe with you,

390
00:14:59,917 --> 00:15:01,709
I better get moving
on this thing.

391
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:03,500
We've got to make
this wall work, George.

392
00:15:03,542 --> 00:15:05,250
We know Lucille 2
will oppose it,

393
00:15:05,291 --> 00:15:07,583
we just have make sure
Herbert Love does.

394
00:15:07,625 --> 00:15:09,417
Oh, don't worry-- that's
why I asked Michael for help.

395
00:15:09,458 --> 00:15:12,709
Michael? What are you bringing
Michael into this for?

396
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:14,750
The only thing he should
be doing is signing over

397
00:15:14,792 --> 00:15:15,834
his rights to the company.

398
00:15:15,875 --> 00:15:17,500
I asked him to do this as well.

399
00:15:17,542 --> 00:15:18,667
<i>He made it a condition</i>

00:15:21,875 --> 00:15:22,917
...do something for me?

403
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:24,834
You know,
your mother is very hurt.

404
00:15:24,875 --> 00:15:26,834
You haven't visited her.
It's like you have given up

405
00:15:26,875 --> 00:15:28,458
-on the family business.
-I have.

406
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:30,333
Yes, but not in writing.

407
00:15:30,375 --> 00:15:32,250
To protect all of us, visit her,

408
00:15:32,291 --> 00:15:34,500
sign a little something
saying it's all hers.

409
00:15:34,542 --> 00:15:35,709
-Will you do this, Michael?
-Yeah.

410
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:36,834
But I get to make you look bad

411
00:15:36,875 --> 00:15:38,250
-in the movie, okay?
-Okay.

412
00:15:38,291 --> 00:15:39,250
-Should we settle up?
-All right.

413

414
00:15:40,792 --> 00:15:42,166
LUCILLE: Send me some evidence
of a wall

415
00:15:42,208 --> 00:15:43,625
I can show the Chinese.

416
00:15:43,667 --> 00:15:44,792
And the government.

417
00:15:44,834 --> 00:15:47,250
We need to make
this happen, George.

418
00:15:47,291 --> 00:15:49,250
The Chinese have more
than a sharpened noodle

419
00:15:49,291 --> 00:15:50,875
with my name on it.

420
00:15:50,917 --> 00:15:52,834

<i>And that's when Lucille noticed</i>

you hot little...

-It's your mother. 
-Hi, sorry, I thought you
were somebody else.

440

I can't tell you who, 'cause
I'm-I'm dating someone famous.

someone... famous.

442
00:16:55,834 --> 00:16:57,834
You better start to build
this wall built pronto.

443
00:16:57,875 --> 00:17:00,458
I tried with your father,
but he can't do it.

444
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:02,291
Well, I'm kind of busy now--
I'm working with Michael.

445

What are you working on
with Michael?

446
00:17:04,333 --> 00:17:05,875
Dad made him give me a job.

447
00:17:05,917 --> 00:17:07,458
I see--
so he thought it was

448
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:09,667
a good idea
to have you two together.

449
00:17:09,709 --> 00:17:11,291
Isn't that nice?

450
00:17:11,333 --> 00:17:13,667
My God, is there anyone there
with half a brain

451
00:17:13,709 --> 00:17:14,959
that can help me with this?

452
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,375
I don't know about
"half a brain,"

453
00:17:16,417 --> 00:17:17,792
but Tobias is living
with me right now

454
00:17:17,834 --> 00:17:19,500

455
00:17:19,542 --> 00:17:22,500
Although he is working in
the rehab where Lucille 2 is.

Well, thank you--
you look very hetero as well.

00:17:58,083 --> 00:18:01,500
Now... how are you?

476
00:18:01,542 --> 00:18:03,083
I'm as normal as blueberry pie.

477

So write that down on a form,
sign me out,

478
00:18:05,542 --> 00:18:07,709
I won't have
to go back to prison,

479
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:11,458
and maybe you'll find a new car
parked in your driveway.

480
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:14,917
Oh...

481
00:18:14,959 --> 00:18:17,000
Yes, well,
it-it doesn't work that way.

482
00:18:17,041 --> 00:18:19,917
We have to have a series
of sessions, and, uh, I have to

483
00:18:19,959 --> 00:18:22,500
swear in the best
of my professional opinion

484
00:18:22,542 --> 00:18:24,834
that you have accepted
and made every effort

485
00:18:24,875 --> 00:18:27,625
at thoughtfully reflecting
upon your weaknesses.

486
00:18:27,667 --> 00:18:29,709
Yes!
Write down that I did that.

487
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:31,333
Well, no,
I-I don't work that way.

488
00:18:31,375 --> 00:18:32,750
You don't work any way.

489
00:18:32,792 --> 00:18:34,542
This is your first paying job
in ten years.

490
00:18:34,583 --> 00:18:35,875
Oh, no, no, this doesn't pay.

491
00:18:35,917 --> 00:18:37,750
This is part of a
work release program.

492
00:18:37,792 --> 00:18:39,917
The state of California thinks
that I'm a sex offender.

493
00:18:39,959 --> 00:18:42,583
D-D-Don't worry about what
the state of California thinks.

494
00:18:42,625 --> 00:18:44,375
The point is we have a chance

495
00:18:44,417 --> 00:18:46,000
to be honest with ourselves.

496
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:48,875
Fine-- you don't look
heterosexual in that suit.

497
00:18:48,917 --> 00:18:51,125
You look as swishy
as Ryan Seacrest.

498
00:18:51,166 --> 00:18:53,083
Ryan Seacrest is straight.

499
00:18:53,125 --> 00:18:55,166
And I'm 40!
Sign the form.

500
00:18:55,208 --> 00:18:57,375
Well, at least we have
a dialogue going.

501
00:18:57,417 --> 00:18:58,917
Dialogue?

502
00:18:58,959 --> 00:19:00,917
If you don't release me
you've heard the last

503
00:19:00,959 --> 00:19:02,834
I'm going to say to you
in these sessions.

504
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:04,750
Fine, but you will have
to sit with me

505
00:19:04,792 --> 00:19:06,458
for the full session.

506
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:09,000
Every single session.

507
00:19:09,041 --> 00:19:13,417
Now, Lucille, I can't
make you talk.

508
00:19:13,458 --> 00:19:15,750
But you know what I can do?

509
00:19:21,667 --> 00:19:23,208
Hmm?

510
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:28,750
Okay, I can't trick you
into talking, either.

511
00:19:28,792 --> 00:19:30,917
<i>This went on</i>
<i>for several sessions.</i>

512
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:40,875
Perhaps that's
why they call this place

513
00:19:40,917 --> 00:19:43,917
Au-stare-ity.

514
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:47,500
No?

515
00:19:49,583 --> 00:19:52,125
Au-stare-i...

516
00:19:52,166 --> 00:19:53,458
Fine.

517
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:54,458
Well, if you're
not going to talk,

518
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:55,667
I'm just going to...

519
00:19:55,709 --> 00:19:57,583
-write this up.
<i>-Earlier that day,</i>

520
00:19:57,625 --> 00:19:59,667
<i>Tobias had encountered</i>
<i>a plot problem</i>

521
00:19:59,709 --> 00:20:01,500
<i>with the</i>
<i>"Fantastic Four" musical.</i>

522
00:20:01,542 --> 00:20:02,667
A villain.

523
00:20:02,709 --> 00:20:04,458
I was thinking the same thing.

524
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:07,041
I mean, why aren't the
Fantastic Four fighting anyone.

525
00:20:07,083 --> 00:20:08,875
Instead of just
dancing around, you mean.

526
00:20:08,917 --> 00:20:10,875
Right, it's like all Sharks
and no Jets.

527
00:20:10,917 --> 00:20:12,917
Then we would have a second act.

528
00:20:12,959 --> 00:20:14,667
Lucia, right?

529
00:20:14,709 --> 00:20:16,083
I mean, that's their foe.

530
00:20:16,125 --> 00:20:17,500
Lucia Von Bardass?

531
00:20:19,125 --> 00:20:21,834
Have you guys ever
even read one of these things?

532
00:20:21,875 --> 00:20:24,083
<i>So Tobias was glad for the</i>
<i>break in Lucille's sessions.</i>

533
00:20:24,125 --> 00:20:25,083
-...to do this right?
<i>-So that he could work on it.</i>

534
00:20:25,125 --> 00:20:26,709
I mean, really right.

535
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:29,125
This woman is a villain.

536
00:20:29,166 --> 00:20:30,625
You think I'm a villain, too?

537
00:20:30,667 --> 00:20:31,792
-No...
-My children

538
00:20:31,834 --> 00:20:33,208
are all waiting for me to die

539
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:34,917
so they can divvy up my stuff,

540
00:20:34,959 --> 00:20:36,875
my Chinese gang mates were
getting ready

541
00:20:36,917 --> 00:20:39,583
to noodle stab me,
and even one of the guards

542
00:20:39,625 --> 00:20:41,500
called me "Gangie,"
and he was talking

543
00:20:41,542 --> 00:20:42,917
about the monster movie.

544
00:20:42,959 --> 00:20:45,291
He thinks that horrible
monster looks like me!

545
00:20:45,333 --> 00:20:47,875
So fine, you want to call me
a villain, I accept it!

546
00:20:47,917 --> 00:20:49,041
I'm your villain!

547
00:20:49,083 --> 00:20:51,250
Uh, actually I was writing down

548
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:52,291
a casting breakdown

549
00:20:52,333 --> 00:20:54,083
for the role of Lucia

550
00:20:54,125 --> 00:20:55,959
for my "Fantastic Four" musical.

551
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,917
This was all
about your stupid play?

552
00:20:58,959 --> 00:21:00,542
I was about to cry

553
00:21:00,583 --> 00:21:02,709
for the first time in 60 years.

554
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:05,208
I remember when
the last time was, too.

555
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:08,208
I hid under Mama's porch
during a thunderstorm...

556
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:10,500
(voice breaks): and I found
the remains of my ostri...

557
00:21:10,542 --> 00:21:12,917
It's not a stupid play.

558
00:21:12,959 --> 00:21:14,500
It's a musical.

559
00:21:14,542 --> 00:21:15,792
And I have to debut it

560
00:21:15,834 --> 00:21:17,208
on a boat at Cinco.

561
00:21:18,625 --> 00:21:19,875
It's on a boat?

562
00:21:19,917 --> 00:21:21,625
Take to the sea!

563
00:21:21,667 --> 00:21:24,000
Yes, I'll sign everyone out
for the night,

564
00:21:24,041 --> 00:21:27,208
but I guess I'll have to play
the old sea bitch myself.

565
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:29,917
I'm in.

566
00:21:29,959 --> 00:21:31,000
Really?

567
00:21:31,041 --> 00:21:32,333
Well, that's wonderful.

568
00:21:32,375 --> 00:21:34,166
Well, I think we have made
a breakthrough today.

569
00:21:34,208 --> 00:21:36,375
In the musical, not you.

570
00:21:36,417 --> 00:21:39,125
Oh, God, no, there's miles
of work to do with you. (laughs)

571
00:21:39,166 --> 00:21:41,750
<i>But, of course,</i>
<i>he would make her audition.</i>

572
00:21:41,792 --> 00:21:43,834
<i>So Lucille wrote a song</i>
<i>from the heart.</i>

573
00:21:43,875 --> 00:21:45,333
LUCILLE:
<i>♪ My children despise me ♪</i>

574
00:21:45,375 --> 00:21:47,083
<i>♪ My husband defies me ♪</i>

575
00:21:47,125 --> 00:21:48,709
<i>♪ It doesn't surprise me ♪</i>

576
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:50,000
<i>♪ The hell with them all ♪</i>

577
00:21:50,041 --> 00:21:51,834
<i>♪ I'll put up a wall ♪</i>

578
00:21:51,875 --> 00:21:53,834
<i>♪ You think I'm a villain ♪</i>

579
00:21:53,875 --> 00:21:55,125
<i>♪ A villain I'll be ♪</i>

580
00:21:55,166 --> 00:21:56,834
<i>♪ My heart is in pain ♪</i>

581
00:21:56,875 --> 00:21:58,875
<i>♪ I just want to flee ♪</i>

582
00:21:58,917 --> 00:22:01,083
<i>♪ From me. ♪</i>

583
00:22:02,917 --> 00:22:04,208
Wonderful.

584
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:05,709
Terrifying.

585
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:06,709
Isn't she?

586
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:07,875
Betty, you can leave.

587
00:22:07,917 --> 00:22:09,834
Lucille, would you please stay?

588
00:22:09,875 --> 00:22:12,709
<i>But staying was the last thing</i>
<i>Lucille had in mind.</i>

589
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:14,125
-(phone rings)
-LUCILLE: Hello?

590
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:16,041
<i>MAN: I want to be with you;</i>
<i>I... I have needs.</i>

591
00:22:16,083 --> 00:22:17,041
George, is that you?

592
00:22:17,083 --> 00:22:18,625
<i>It wasn't.</i>

593
00:22:18,667 --> 00:22:21,125
<i>It was Oscar who,</i>
<i>living as George,</i>

594
00:22:21,166 --> 00:22:23,291
<i>-and feeling more amorous...</i>
-(Oscar whistles)

595
00:22:23,333 --> 00:22:26,834
<i>...went to visit Lucille 2</i>
<i>for an afternoon delight.</i>

596
00:22:26,875 --> 00:22:29,041
<i>When she wasn't there,</i>
<i>he found her work number.</i>

597
00:22:29,083 --> 00:22:30,041
WOMAN:
<i>Austerity.</i>

598
00:22:30,083 --> 00:22:31,375
Lucille 2, please?

599
00:22:31,417 --> 00:22:33,417
<i>But, of course, at Austerity,</i>

600
00:22:33,458 --> 00:22:35,959
<i>-this woman is Lucille 2.</i>
-Hello.

601
00:22:36,041 --> 00:22:37,875
I want to be with you;
I... I have needs.

602
00:22:37,917 --> 00:22:39,458
LUCILLE:
<i>George, is that you?</i>

603
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:41,750
<i>But a newly virile Oscar</i>
<i>figured, in a pinch,</i>

604
00:22:41,792 --> 00:22:43,709
<i>any Lucille would do.</i>

605
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:46,083
Yes, this is George.
Where are you?

606
00:22:46,125 --> 00:22:47,792
I'm in rehab, you know that.

607
00:22:47,834 --> 00:22:50,291
Why don't I swing by,
and we can conjugate?

608
00:22:50,333 --> 00:22:51,959
Let's do our business
over the phone.

609
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,917
May not have a lot of time,
but, uh, all right, here goes:

610
00:22:54,959 --> 00:22:58,041
<i>I want to pull your panties</i>
<i>off with my...</i>

611
00:22:58,083 --> 00:22:59,667
Real business, George.

612
00:22:59,709 --> 00:23:02,834
I'd very much like to pull your
underwear off with my teeth...

613
00:23:02,875 --> 00:23:04,250
LUCILLE:
<i>No-- at Cinco,</i>

614
00:23:04,291 --> 00:23:06,750
<i>we're getting on a boat,</i>
<i>we're leaving the country.</i>

615
00:23:06,792 --> 00:23:08,166
OSCAR:
<i>But what about love?</i>

616
00:23:08,208 --> 00:23:11,250
Easy-- Gene Parmesan
got photos of Herbert Love

617
00:23:11,291 --> 00:23:12,667
with some redheaded whore.

618
00:23:12,709 --> 00:23:16,000
I'm giving his wife a taste,
so he knows we know.

619
00:23:16,041 --> 00:23:19,208
If he wins, we should be able to
get him to do whatever we want

620
00:23:19,250 --> 00:23:20,917
<i>with that wall now.</i>

621
00:23:20,959 --> 00:23:21,917
-(phone beeps)
<i>-I'm not completely following...</i>

622
00:23:21,959 --> 00:23:23,458
Oop. Hold on.

623
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:25,417
<i>And that's when Lucille finally</i>
<i>had a visit from her son.</i>

624
00:23:25,458 --> 00:23:27,458
-Hello.
<i>-Michael Bluth here to see you.</i>

625
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:29,125
Send him up.

626
00:23:29,166 --> 00:23:31,208
<i>-OSCAR: ...with my teeth.</i>
-Michael's here.

627
00:23:31,250 --> 00:23:32,875
-Oh...
-This is my chance to make sure

628
00:23:32,917 --> 00:23:34,375
he doesn't get
too cozy with Gob.

629
00:23:34,417 --> 00:23:36,417
-Why?
-Bad things happen

630
00:23:36,458 --> 00:23:38,125
when brothers collude.

631
00:23:42,792 --> 00:23:44,291
When can we have sex?

632
00:23:44,333 --> 00:23:45,458
LUCILLE:
<i>After Cinco.</i>

633
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:47,291
Cinco?

634
00:23:47,333 --> 00:23:49,959
<i>LUCILLE: Just get a boat ready,</i>
<i>we'll make our getaway.</i>

635
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,959
So not... not today.

636
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,375
<i>And that's when she saw Michael</i>
<i>for the first time</i>

637
00:23:55,417 --> 00:23:57,792
<i>since the last time</i>
<i>he left the family.</i>

638
00:23:57,834 --> 00:23:59,125
Wow.

639
00:23:59,166 --> 00:24:00,500
This is a step up from prison.

640
00:24:00,542 --> 00:24:02,208
How would you know?

641
00:24:02,250 --> 00:24:03,792
You haven't come
to visit me once.

642
00:24:03,834 --> 00:24:04,792
Yeah. Sorry.

643
00:24:04,834 --> 00:24:05,792
I feel bad about that.

644
00:24:05,834 --> 00:24:07,959
So you're here to make amends?

645
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,417
Because you know your mother
will always take you back.

646
00:24:10,458 --> 00:24:13,041
And because
I know my mother wants me

647
00:24:13,083 --> 00:24:15,208
to sign away any connection
to the family business.

648
00:24:15,250 --> 00:24:16,375
I just need a signature.

649
00:24:16,417 --> 00:24:17,959
I'm happy to help.
If...

650
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,291
-you do something for me.
-For me.

651
00:24:20,333 --> 00:24:22,500
Yeah, I heard
that's been happening.

652
00:24:22,542 --> 00:24:24,834
I'm happy to help you, honey.

653
00:24:24,875 --> 00:24:26,500
Me, too.

654
00:24:26,542 --> 00:24:29,458
<i>And that's how Michael got his</i>
<i>mother's rights to the movie.</i>

655
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:32,041
<i>But not right away.</i>

656
00:24:43,291 --> 00:24:44,375
So happy to help.

657
00:24:44,417 --> 00:24:45,458
Me, too.

658
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:48,000
-So, everything else is good?
-Yeah.

659
00:24:48,041 --> 00:24:50,458
You've talked to your sister,
the radical?

660
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:52,417
Yeah. She's a redhead now,
and she's dating Herbert Love,

661
00:24:52,458 --> 00:24:54,291
but other than her looks
and her belief system,

662
00:24:54,333 --> 00:24:55,792
-Oh...
-she's the same old Lindsay.

663
00:24:55,834 --> 00:24:58,583
So that's Lindsay in the photo.

664
00:24:58,625 --> 00:25:00,291
And I hear you're dating
an actress...

665
00:25:00,333 --> 00:25:01,834
who's also dating Ron Howard?

666
00:25:01,875 --> 00:25:02,875
(wry laugh)

667
00:25:02,917 --> 00:25:04,375
No, no...
no, no, no, no, no, no.

668
00:25:04,417 --> 00:25:06,417
She is not dating
Ron Howard, Mother.

669
00:25:06,458 --> 00:25:07,792
Ron Howard is her father, okay?

670
00:25:07,834 --> 00:25:09,208
(Michael chuckles)

671
00:25:09,250 --> 00:25:11,250
Your mind...

672
00:25:11,291 --> 00:25:13,417
I did, though, actually
find out who she is dating.

673
00:25:13,458 --> 00:25:15,417
<i>Michael had found out,</i>
<i>earlier that day,</i>

674
00:25:15,458 --> 00:25:18,000
<i>when he visited</i>
<i>her apartment to head off</i>

675
00:25:18,041 --> 00:25:21,500
<i>any ill feelings</i>
<i>she might have about this...</i>

676
00:25:21,542 --> 00:25:23,083
I'll do everything
in my power to make sure

677
00:25:23,125 --> 00:25:24,083
she never dates you again.

678
00:25:24,125 --> 00:25:25,125
<i>Or this...</i>

679
00:25:25,166 --> 00:25:26,500
You are ruining
my life, Ron Howard!

680
00:25:26,542 --> 00:25:27,625
Nice, right?

681
00:25:27,667 --> 00:25:29,125
Is too big.

682
00:25:29,166 --> 00:25:31,500
She likes small.

683
00:25:31,542 --> 00:25:33,417
LEM:
Can I please have ice cream?

684
00:25:33,458 --> 00:25:36,500
No, no, you are a Depardieu.
No sweets.

685
00:25:36,542 --> 00:25:38,583
Getting excited about Cinco?

686
00:25:38,625 --> 00:25:42,000
Your Cinco, not ours.

687
00:25:45,208 --> 00:25:48,500
<i>Michael wasn't proud</i>
<i>of what he was about to do.</i>

688
00:25:48,542 --> 00:25:50,542
Hey, Lem, I can reach
the ice cream and, you know,

689
00:25:50,583 --> 00:25:52,083
in my family,
we play a game called

690
00:25:52,125 --> 00:25:55,875
"If You Do Something For Me."

691
00:25:55,917 --> 00:25:57,417
Rules are meant
to be broken, huh?

692
00:25:57,458 --> 00:26:00,417
I will give you this Dove bar,
if you do something for me.

693
00:26:00,458 --> 00:26:01,709
We have Dove bars?

694
00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:03,583
We do. Look at that.

695
00:26:03,625 --> 00:26:07,542
Tell me what you know
about this "George Maharis."

696
00:26:07,583 --> 00:26:08,542
Not much.

697
00:26:08,583 --> 00:26:09,542
He's old.

698
00:26:09,583 --> 00:26:11,000
Is he older than me?

699
00:26:11,041 --> 00:26:12,208
A few years.

700
00:26:12,250 --> 00:26:13,458
He looks like you.

701
00:26:14,583 --> 00:26:16,542
So, handsome.

702
00:26:16,583 --> 00:26:19,000
<i>And that's when Lucille</i>
<i>found a way</i>

703
00:26:19,041 --> 00:26:20,667
<i>to keep the brothers</i>
<i>from colluding.</i>

704
00:26:20,709 --> 00:26:22,583
George Maharis.

705
00:26:22,625 --> 00:26:24,458
George--
that's your brother's name.

706
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:25,625
George Oscar Bluth.

707
00:26:25,667 --> 00:26:29,709
Yes, uh, George
is Gob's first name, yep.

708
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:31,250
<i>And that's when Michael</i>

709
00:26:31,291 --> 00:26:33,083
<i>remembered something else</i>
<i>strange.</i>

710
00:26:36,041 --> 00:26:38,000
I probably should have
expected that.

711
00:26:38,041 --> 00:26:39,583
<i>And then stranger...</i>

712
00:26:39,625 --> 00:26:41,000
MICHAEL:
"Love each other..."

713
00:26:41,041 --> 00:26:43,583
Oh, that definitely
sounds like Gob.

714
00:26:43,625 --> 00:26:46,375
And he did say he was
seeing someone famous...

715
00:26:46,417 --> 00:26:47,959
...dating someone famous.

716
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,291
<i>And Michael remembered</i>
<i>hearing about that, as well.</i>

717
00:26:50,333 --> 00:26:52,375
Me doth think he hath a lady.

718
00:26:52,417 --> 00:26:55,208
-Oh. -And they're both
a bit of celebrities.

719
00:26:55,250 --> 00:26:58,458
Well, that is odd, because I,
I'm also dating a celebrity.

720
00:26:58,500 --> 00:26:59,583
If I were you,
I'd put a tail on him.

721
00:26:59,625 --> 00:27:01,458
Get a P.I.

722
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:03,709
Where the hell
am I gonna find a P.I.?

723
00:27:03,750 --> 00:27:05,208
Gene Parmesan...

724
00:27:05,250 --> 00:27:06,959
at your service.

725
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:07,959
(screaming)

726
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:08,959
Gene!

727
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,208
He does this to me every time!

728
00:27:11,250 --> 00:27:13,208
-What's he doing here, Mom?
-Oh, he's working for me.

729
00:27:13,250 --> 00:27:14,208
Why'd you scream, then?

730
00:27:14,250 --> 00:27:17,542
I thought he was that guy.

731
00:27:20,041 --> 00:27:22,000
Mm.

732
00:27:23,542 --> 00:27:25,333
NARRATOR:
<i>At Lucille's behest,</i>

733
00:27:25,375 --> 00:27:28,417
<i>Michael borrowed the family</i>
<i>P.I. to follow his brother.</i>

734
00:27:28,458 --> 00:27:30,417
GENE:
<i>He just drove by. Pick me up.</i>

735
00:27:30,458 --> 00:27:33,083
MICHAEL:
This is the great disguise, huh?

736
00:27:33,125 --> 00:27:34,458
Fry cook!

737
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:36,417
Oh, no, no,
this is my horrible night job.

738
00:27:36,458 --> 00:27:38,542
In fact, I was hoping
you could drop me off

739
00:27:38,583 --> 00:27:40,208
at Chicken Dan's
when we're all done.

740
00:27:40,250 --> 00:27:41,208
Chicken Dan's, huh?

741
00:27:41,250 --> 00:27:42,792
That is embarrassing.

742
00:27:42,834 --> 00:27:45,083
This from a man who's driving
around a mapping car?

743
00:27:45,125 --> 00:27:47,000
You know, I don't even think
these things work.

744
00:27:47,041 --> 00:27:48,667
That's why I rely
on these babies right here--

745
00:27:48,709 --> 00:27:50,291
the old binocs.

746
00:27:50,333 --> 00:27:52,291
Let's see if we can't find
this target.

747
00:27:52,333 --> 00:27:54,291
You know, the great thing
about these is,

748
00:27:54,333 --> 00:27:57,083
there's no software to update...

749
00:27:57,125 --> 00:27:58,750
-Oh, God, what are you doing?
-Sorry.

750
00:27:58,792 --> 00:28:00,417
Oh, these binoculars
make me nauseous.

751
00:28:00,458 --> 00:28:01,542
MICHAEL:
Well, of course they do.

752
00:28:01,583 --> 00:28:03,208
Why don't you just use the maps?

753
00:28:03,250 --> 00:28:05,667
-No. -We're in
a satellite-linked mapping car.

754
00:28:05,709 --> 00:28:08,583
No, no. Sometimes
the old ways are the...

755
00:28:08,625 --> 00:28:09,792
-Hey.
-You-you better pull over.

756
00:28:09,834 --> 00:28:11,083
-All right, hang on.
-Pull over!

757
00:28:11,125 --> 00:28:12,166
One, two.

758
00:28:12,208 --> 00:28:13,083
<i>And while Michael was</i>
<i>waylaid...</i>

759
00:28:13,125 --> 00:28:14,291

760
00:28:14,333 --> 00:28:15,667

on her tap dancing.

761
00:28:15,709 --> 00:28:16,709
One, two.

770
00:28:32,792 --> 00:28:34,375
She can't do it like that.

-Oh, uh,

772
00:28:36,208 --> 00:28:38,083
DeBrie, you might have missed
a step, so...

773
00:28:38,125 --> 00:28:40,291
-Sorry. I think I might...
I hurt my leg. -Oh.

00:28:40,333 --> 00:28:43,083
And so, I need some, mm,

No. DeBrie, come on. (laughs)

777
00:28:46,750 --> 00:28:48,458
Don't you want to get back
on that horse?

778
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:50,125
Even better!

779
00:28:50,166 --> 00:28:51,875
<i>She was the best</i>

780
00:28:51,917 --> 00:28:54,750

784
00:29:00,333 --> 00:29:03,542
<i>Oscar did indeed borrow a boat</i>
<i>and left it idling,</i>

785
00:29:03,583 --> 00:29:07,417
<i>which unfortunately, was what</i>
<i>this man was looking for.</i>

786
00:29:07,458 --> 00:29:09,834

788
00:29:12,333 --> 00:29:14,750
There you are!

789
00:29:14,792 --> 00:29:17,166
What are you doing here?

790
00:29:17,208 --> 00:29:18,917
What do you mean,
what am I doing here?

791
00:29:18,959 --> 00:29:20,750
We made plans...
to escape on the boat!

792
00:29:20,792 --> 00:29:23,959
I never made plans with you.

793
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,208
But we talked
about it on the phone,

794
00:29:26,250 --> 00:29:28,375
when you were trying
to talk dirty to me.

795
00:29:28,417 --> 00:29:29,750
-Oh.
-What is wrong with you?

796
00:29:29,792 --> 00:29:31,625
This is... this is embarrassing.
Full disclosure.

797
00:29:31,667 --> 00:29:33,291
Uh, that was Oscar,

798
00:29:33,333 --> 00:29:35,333
who may have been the one
you were talking with.

799
00:29:35,375 --> 00:29:38,500
He's been filling in...
for me occasionally.

800
00:29:38,542 --> 00:29:42,208
Filling in?
As in, visiting me?

801
00:29:42,250 --> 00:29:44,792
You sent your brother
to have sex with me?

802
00:29:44,834 --> 00:29:46,667
No, I sent him to listen to you

803
00:29:46,709 --> 00:29:48,709
one time, and then,
he found out about the wall,

804
00:29:48,750 --> 00:29:50,417
and tried to get you
talking about it,

805
00:29:50,458 --> 00:29:53,250
and this was his way
of shutting you up.

806
00:29:53,291 --> 00:29:55,375
-He told you this?
-No, you told me

807
00:29:55,417 --> 00:29:56,792
when I visited.

808
00:29:56,834 --> 00:29:59,583
I got in there
a couple of times... too.

809
00:29:59,625 --> 00:30:01,291
Oh, but not for sex.

810
00:30:01,333 --> 00:30:02,917
I don't have the tiger
in my tank anymore.

811
00:30:02,959 --> 00:30:04,792
Maybe I do need a vacay.

812
00:30:04,834 --> 00:30:06,333
So, tell me about this trip.

813
00:30:06,375 --> 00:30:07,917
That's interesting.
Where we going?

814
00:30:07,959 --> 00:30:09,583
I'll tell you where we're going.

815
00:30:09,625 --> 00:30:11,208
We're going to court.

816
00:30:11,250 --> 00:30:13,333
We're getting a real divorce.

817
00:30:13,375 --> 00:30:16,667
You're out of the marriage.

818
00:30:16,709 --> 00:30:18,667
Lucille...?

819
00:30:18,709 --> 00:30:20,917
<i>And that's when she came</i>
<i>face to face with the man...</i>

820
00:30:20,959 --> 00:30:22,583
<i>...whose face</i>
<i>she'd just faced...</i>

821
00:30:22,625 --> 00:30:24,333
-Are you ready?
<i>...but it was a different...</i>

822
00:30:24,375 --> 00:30:25,875
<i>-It-it was Oscar.</i>
-Hello, Oscar.

823
00:30:25,917 --> 00:30:27,875
You should get an Oscar
for your portrayal of George

824
00:30:27,917 --> 00:30:31,000
in "Screw the Oblivious
Sister-in-law."

825
00:30:31,041 --> 00:30:32,917
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

826
00:30:32,959 --> 00:30:34,250
You-you got me.

827
00:30:34,291 --> 00:30:36,000
I was gon...
I was gonna tell you.

828
00:30:36,041 --> 00:30:38,291
I was acting
when I pretended to be George,

829
00:30:38,333 --> 00:30:40,500
but I am dead serious when I say

830
00:30:40,542 --> 00:30:44,250
you are the hottest woman
I know.

831
00:30:44,291 --> 00:30:48,875
I'm here tonight because
I want to run away with you.

832
00:30:48,917 --> 00:30:50,458
Oscar. Really?

833
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:52,375
Of course. What?

834
00:30:52,417 --> 00:30:54,917
Do you think I'm here for the
donkey punch? Which I do love,

835
00:30:54,959 --> 00:30:56,917
and it's the only night
you can get it.

836
00:30:56,959 --> 00:31:00,000
But you are the only woman
for me, Lucille!

837
00:31:00,041 --> 00:31:03,500
Bring me those thin,
pot-stained lips.

838
00:31:03,542 --> 00:31:05,291
Oh, honey.

839
00:31:05,333 --> 00:31:07,250
(both moaning)

840
00:31:07,291 --> 00:31:08,875
-What's this?
-I have no idea.

841
00:31:08,917 --> 00:31:10,458
<i>And that's when she found out</i>
<i>the latest thing</i>

842

843

<i>He'd actually acquired it</i>

845
00:31:17,333 --> 00:31:19,709
-That, um...
-She's claimed you!

846
00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:21,917
Everyone I know wants
to take everything away from me!

847
00:31:21,959 --> 00:31:23,083
No! That's not true.

848
00:31:23,125 --> 00:31:24,583
I love you.

849
00:31:24,625 --> 00:31:26,458
I don't know if it's the maca.

850
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:28,291
I've just been so randy lately.

851
00:31:28,333 --> 00:31:30,500
But you're...

852
00:31:30,542 --> 00:31:31,792
you...

853
00:31:31,834 --> 00:31:33,542
you're my kind of Lucille!

854
00:31:33,583 --> 00:31:34,834
Get away from me, you liar.

855
00:31:34,875 --> 00:31:37,542
I can't believe
you were with her.

856
00:31:37,583 --> 00:31:38,542
She's finished.

857
00:31:38,583 --> 00:31:41,000
And the Oscar goes, too!

858
00:31:41,041 --> 00:31:42,500
To...?

859
00:31:42,542 --> 00:31:43,875
Get out of my sight!

860
00:31:43,917 --> 00:31:45,375
<i>She was in an emotional storm</i>

861
00:31:45,417 --> 00:31:47,417
<i>and could have used</i>
<i>a therapist.</i>

862
00:31:47,458 --> 00:31:49,333
-Oh, my God...
-TOBIAS: Lucille!

863
00:31:49,375 --> 00:31:51,333
<i>-When she ran into a therapist</i>
-Where are you going?

864
00:31:51,375 --> 00:31:52,834
<i>who could've used a storm.</i>

865
00:31:52,875 --> 00:31:54,500
To disappear.

866
00:31:54,542 --> 00:31:57,291
That's what everyone
wants me to do.

867
00:31:57,333 --> 00:31:59,291
Lucille!

868
00:31:59,333 --> 00:32:01,458
You are not the villain.

869
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:03,542
(sighs)

870
00:32:03,583 --> 00:32:05,375
I'm so tired
of being the villain.

871
00:32:05,417 --> 00:32:06,917
Well, those days are over.

872
00:32:06,959 --> 00:32:10,041
What you are
is the Invisible Girl.

873
00:32:10,083 --> 00:32:11,750
You make it impossible
for people

874
00:32:11,792 --> 00:32:13,542
to see you in order
to protect yourself.

875
00:32:13,583 --> 00:32:15,000
<i>And somehow, in that moment,</i>

876
00:32:15,041 --> 00:32:16,542
<i>something changed for her.</i>

877
00:32:16,583 --> 00:32:17,917
I do do that.

878
00:32:17,959 --> 00:32:19,917
And in this way, you launch

879
00:32:19,959 --> 00:32:21,625
sneak attacks,
and you create a force field

880
00:32:21,667 --> 00:32:23,000
to keep people away.

881
00:32:23,041 --> 00:32:25,000
Right! I'm not a villain.

882
00:32:25,041 --> 00:32:26,875
I'm the Invisible Girl!

883
00:32:26,917 --> 00:32:28,542
Yes, that's what I'm saying!

884
00:32:28,583 --> 00:32:31,792
Oh, you know, it's funny...
I never would have

885
00:32:31,834 --> 00:32:34,917
come to this if it hadn't been
for Lucille 2's rehab.

886
00:32:34,959 --> 00:32:38,458
I need to pay her back
for everything she's done to me.

887
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:41,542
I'm going back to rehab.

888
00:32:41,583 --> 00:32:45,458
I just have
to make one quick stop first.

889
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:47,125
I don't think we have time.

890
00:32:47,166 --> 00:32:48,792
<i>And that's the night</i>
<i>that Lucille decided</i>

891
00:32:48,834 --> 00:32:50,166
<i>she didn't want</i>
<i>to be invisible anymore.</i>

892
00:32:50,208 --> 00:32:52,000
I've got to do this...

893
00:32:52,041 --> 00:32:54,542
<i>And perhaps, ironically,</i>
<i>it was also</i>

894
00:32:54,583 --> 00:32:58,834
<i>the night that Lucille 2</i>
<i>became the Invisible Girl.</i>

895
00:32:58,875 --> 00:33:00,500
(explosion)

896
00:33:03,250 --> 00:33:05,083
<i>Tobias boards the boat</i>

897
00:33:05,125 --> 00:33:07,166
<i>originally meant</i>
<i>for Lucille's escape,</i>

898
00:33:07,208 --> 00:33:11,041
<i>and after making one stop,</i>
<i>faces the awful truth.</i>

899
00:33:11,083 --> 00:33:14,625
They're going to be talking
about this bomb for years.

900
00:33:14,667 --> 00:33:16,834
TOBIAS:
Oh, God, it is bad, isn't it?

901
00:33:16,875 --> 00:33:18,875
Lindsay was right
to discourage me.

902
00:33:20,875 --> 00:33:23,000
-Tobias?
-Marky?

903
00:33:23,041 --> 00:33:25,083
If you're not Lindsay,
then where is Lindsay?

904
00:33:25,125 --> 00:33:26,583
Isn't that her
on the love boat?

905
00:33:26,625 --> 00:33:29,125
-But I just put a bomb
on the love boat! 
-What?!

906
00:33:29,166 --> 00:33:30,667
-Lindsay! Lindsay!
-Lindsay! Lindsay!

907
00:33:30,709 --> 00:33:31,917
Lindsay, there's a bomb!

908
00:33:34,875 --> 00:33:35,834
<i>Lindsay remembers</i>
<i>she's on a boat...</i>

909
00:33:35,875 --> 00:33:36,917
Oh, (bleep)

910
00:33:36,959 --> 00:33:38,834
<i>...that Marky had intended</i>
<i>to bomb.</i>

911
00:33:38,875 --> 00:33:40,000
You gotta get off the boat!

912
00:33:40,041 --> 00:33:41,959
<i>And it turns out</i>
<i>to be kind of romantic.</i>

913
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,959
Bomb!

914
00:33:44,834 --> 00:33:46,625
(whoops)

915
00:33:46,667 --> 00:33:49,917
<i>...that Lindsay and Tobias</i>
<i>have matching suitcases.</i>
