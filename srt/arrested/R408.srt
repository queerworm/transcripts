<i>At the Father B Colony Retreat,</i>

<i>sweat 'n' squeeze guru George Sr.</i>
<i>was growing more empowered every day,</i>

3
00:00:23,565 --> 00:00:26,109
<i>while his twin brother Oscar was bushed.</i>

4
00:00:26,192 --> 00:00:28,445
Hey, Oscar, that scared me.

5
00:00:28,528 --> 00:00:31,072
Come on, man, get back in there.
I was starting to sweat.

6
00:00:31,156 --> 00:00:35,869
[narrator]<i> Which was Oscar's job, for he</i>
<i>had been masquerading as George Sr.</i>

7
00:00:35,952 --> 00:00:38,204
<i>during the sweat phase of the retreat</i>

8
00:00:38,288 --> 00:00:43,334
<i>and then switching places with George Sr.,</i>
<i>who'd focus on the squeeze.</i>

9
00:00:43,418 --> 00:00:48,631
I was willing to spend $10,000
for just a sip of this lemonade.

10
00:00:48,882 --> 00:00:49,716
Fifteen!

11
00:00:49,799 --> 00:00:51,634
I'm just trying to get my strength up.

12
00:00:51,718 --> 00:00:55,555
Maca usually gets me there.
Hey, chew some maca with me.

13
00:00:55,638 --> 00:00:58,308
I can't, okay?
I gotta go up to see Lucille tomorrow.

14
00:00:58,391 --> 00:01:01,978
[narrator] <i>Whom he'd been meeting under</i>
<i>the pretense of working on their divorce.</i>

15
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:04,647
-Fifteen minutes for prisoner visits.
-You look nice.

16
00:01:04,731 --> 00:01:07,734
Stop trying to butter me up
and let's just get this divorce agreed to

17
00:01:07,817 --> 00:01:09,444
so you can get out of here.

18
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,281
-[narrator] <i>But the divorce was a sham.</i>
-It's almost like adultery this way.

19
00:01:13,364 --> 00:01:14,407
Good, I like that.

20
00:01:14,491 --> 00:01:17,994
-My wife doesn't understand me.
-My husband doesn't satisfy me.

21
00:01:18,369 --> 00:01:22,999
Oh! I haven't had an orgasm outside
of my bathtub in 30 years.

22
00:01:23,625 --> 00:01:24,542
How's that?

23
00:01:25,627 --> 00:01:27,712
[Oscar] Although at times
I do wish it were darker.

24
00:01:27,796 --> 00:01:30,173
It's too bad you don't have time
to try this. Yesterday...

25
00:01:30,256 --> 00:01:32,258
I was talking to a lizard,

26
00:01:32,342 --> 00:01:34,135
and it turned into Elizabeth Taylor.

27
00:01:34,219 --> 00:01:35,178
Young Elizabeth Taylor?

28
00:01:35,261 --> 00:01:36,471
Yeah.

29
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:39,641
Yeah, I could use some maca.
Give me some of that.

30
00:01:41,059 --> 00:01:43,478
[narrator] <i>And soon a vision did appear.</i>

31
00:01:44,395 --> 00:01:47,649
I wonder what's going on. For some reason,
I'm just getting Richard Burton today.

32
00:01:49,818 --> 00:01:51,361
Oh, my God, what's that?

33
00:01:51,444 --> 00:01:53,905
That's the commode.
Are you at all concerned

34
00:01:53,988 --> 00:01:56,199
that the maca bush is directly downhill
from that?

35
00:01:56,324 --> 00:01:59,702
[narrator] <i>He should have been, but Oscar</i>
<i>was actually referring to</i>

36
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:02,413
<i>what now appeared to be a divine spirit</i>

37
00:02:02,622 --> 00:02:04,374
<i>personified as an ostrich.</i>

38
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:06,543
You trespass on sacred ground.

39
00:02:06,876 --> 00:02:09,087
The spirits command me to warn you

40
00:02:09,212 --> 00:02:12,632
you must leave this land,
or the land will change you.

41
00:02:12,841 --> 00:02:15,135
Don't worry,
he's probably from a local reservation.

42
00:02:15,218 --> 00:02:17,512
I'll take care of this.
How about you book me two nights

43
00:02:17,595 --> 00:02:19,597
for Ray Romano at your casino?

44
00:02:20,014 --> 00:02:22,475
The strong will become the weak,

45
00:02:22,767 --> 00:02:25,103
the weak will become the strong.

46
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:29,357
And get us close to the front,
but not close enough that Ray talks to us.

47
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,442
You have been warned.

48
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:38,783
I don't know what you saw,
but I got an ostrich and no boner.

49
00:02:40,285 --> 00:02:42,287
{\an8}[narrator]

50

{\an8}<i>when the one man</i>

58

{\an8}[narrator] <i>For the most part.</i>

Marky! Mommy needs mescaline!

61

{\an8}[narrator] <i>...and his mother.</i>

62
00:03:21,409 --> 00:03:24,746
{\an8}And tell your girlfriend DeBrie
to shovel that ostrich crap.

63
00:03:24,913 --> 00:03:27,874
{\an8}It's not DeBrie, Ma Bark, it's Lindsay.

64
00:03:27,999 --> 00:03:30,877
{\an8}-I just cut off my hair.
-I know who you are.

65

66
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:33,546
God, you're lazier than Lindsay.

67

{\an8}Marky, hurry! There's another dead iguana.

69

What does this mean?

70
00:03:41,387 --> 00:03:43,097
It's probably those bastards next door.

71
00:03:43,181 --> 00:03:44,641
{\an8}They want us off their land.

72
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,227
{\an8}Probably so they can build a border wall.

73
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:50,104
{\an8}They just wanna separate the whites
from the browns.

74
00:03:50,188 --> 00:03:51,773
{\an8}You really are colorblind.

75
00:03:52,315 --> 00:03:53,233
{\an8}Face-blind.

76

{\an8}Fortunately, I can see color.

77
00:03:55,193 --> 00:03:57,153
{\an8}That's how I can tell the browns

84

85
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:24,764
{\an8}[narrator] <i>It was also the reason that</i>

108

-It smells weird in here. What is that?
-I think it's just... not urine.

Look, Lindsay, Cindy already marked
the master.

119

All right, this'll be where she goes.

00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:50,428
I meant what we're gonna do
to this guy. Herbert Love.

163
00:07:50,511 --> 00:07:51,637
Oh.

164
00:07:51,721 --> 00:07:53,806
[narrator] <i>Herbert Love</i>
<i>was a very conservative candidate</i>

165
00:07:53,931 --> 00:07:55,683
<i>for a very conservative seat</i>

166
00:07:55,766 --> 00:07:58,269
<i>in the very conservative</i>
<i>House of Representatives.</i>

167
00:07:58,352 --> 00:08:02,523
The two women who accused me of this crime
do not have a great sense of humor.

168
00:08:02,607 --> 00:08:05,193
In fact, I'll tell you the joke
and let you be the judge.

169
00:08:05,276 --> 00:08:06,444
[narrator] <i>Although he was prone</i>

170
00:08:06,527 --> 00:08:08,988
<i>to the more-than-occasional</i>
<i>harassment scandal.</i>

171
00:08:09,071 --> 00:08:10,239
I forgot the joke.

172
00:08:10,698 --> 00:08:12,492
Oh, he's about to be harassed, all right.

173
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:15,119
I'm gonna spray the bastards
with ink and glitter

174
00:08:15,203 --> 00:08:17,079
at his big fundraising event this week.

175
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:19,165
It'll be in their ears for weeks.

176
00:08:19,373 --> 00:08:21,125
Thing is,
I can't find the glitter anywhere.

177
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:24,045
-Did you take the silver glitter?
-No. I'd say check the junk drawer,

178
00:08:24,128 --> 00:08:26,380
but I can't differentiate anymore.

179
00:08:26,714 --> 00:08:28,132
Oh, God. What is this?

180
00:08:28,382 --> 00:08:32,053
Oh, okay. Good, perfect timing,
because this is where you come in.

181
00:08:32,136 --> 00:08:34,639
A lot of this has to do
with ink compression, oxygen capacity,

182
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:36,766
expulsion pressures, but the point is...

183
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:39,477
three days before the event,
I'm gonna take the explosive

184
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:40,561
-and hide in the podium.
-[scoffs]

185
00:08:40,645 --> 00:08:42,563
On the night of the event,
at exactly 7:30,

186
00:08:42,647 --> 00:08:44,190
I'm gonna pull the pin to the tank.

187
00:08:44,273 --> 00:08:47,485
Then you're gonna knock on the podium door
to let me know that the coast is clear.

188
00:08:47,568 --> 00:08:50,488
When Love steps up to the podium
at exactly eight o'clock, blam!

189
00:08:50,571 --> 00:08:53,658
The podium doors burst open
and he and everyone will be--

190
00:08:53,741 --> 00:08:55,117
Blue in the face, yep.

191
00:08:55,743 --> 00:08:56,994
That's better than what I had.

192
00:08:57,078 --> 00:08:59,163
I was gonna say they'd be covered
in ink and glitter.

193
00:08:59,247 --> 00:09:01,541
Or we could support Lucille 2,
who he's running against.

194
00:09:01,624 --> 00:09:05,753
[narrator] <i>Lucille 2 was indeed</i>
<i>Herbert Love's opponent in that race,</i>

195
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,130
<i>and although she denied it was the reason</i>

196
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:10,883
<i>for her adopting</i>
<i>an Hispanic high school student,</i>

197
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:14,554
<i>it was undeniable that she knew</i>

198
00:09:14,637 --> 00:09:15,930
<i>to win their hearts.</i>

199
00:09:16,013 --> 00:09:17,890
No, she's part of the problem!

200
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:19,767
Wait, you haven't been going over there?

201
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:21,602
-No one can know we're here.
-Of course not.

202
00:09:22,144 --> 00:09:23,563
Does it look like I'm lying?

203
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:24,564
[narrator] <i>It did.</i>

204
00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:28,776
<i>But not to a man with face blindness.</i>

205
00:09:29,277 --> 00:09:30,403
No, I guess not.

206
00:09:30,486 --> 00:09:33,072
{\an8}[narrator] <i>Because Lindsay could only</i>
<i>spend so many hours</i>

207
00:09:33,155 --> 00:09:35,074
{\an8}<i>with a shrill feathered creature.</i>

208
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:38,786
You look marvelous in that!

209
00:09:38,869 --> 00:09:39,829
Look.

210
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:43,291
God, I can't believe how much I've missed
the feel of anything that isn't hemp.

211
00:09:43,374 --> 00:09:44,417
And try this.

212
00:09:45,126 --> 00:09:47,670
Isn't that funny? I used to wear that
with the captain.

213
00:09:47,795 --> 00:09:49,297
-And I was...
-Tennille?

214
00:09:49,505 --> 00:09:52,133
And not make eye contact, yes!

215
00:09:52,216 --> 00:09:54,927
What am I going to do,
cut it down for my foster child?

216
00:09:56,137 --> 00:09:57,763
Oh, look what I made you.

217
00:09:58,806 --> 00:10:00,516
Oh, I love it.

218
00:10:00,683 --> 00:10:02,560
It's glittery, like me.

219
00:10:02,643 --> 00:10:05,771
[narrator] <i>Lindsay was no stranger</i>
<i>to making campaign posters,</i>

220
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:07,732
{\an8}<i>having made several</i>

222
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:16,365
<i>Sally ultimately proved successful,</i>
<i>with a more fact-based campaign.</i>

223
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:20,536
A couple of tiny notes, honey.
There are two S in "congress,"

224
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,163
and I just call myself--

225
00:10:22,246 --> 00:10:26,334
-Lucille 1, I'm so sorry.
-No, just Lucille.

226
00:10:26,417 --> 00:10:27,376
But I love it.

227
00:10:27,501 --> 00:10:30,379
Oh, I wish you'd officially work
for my campaign.

228
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:32,298
We could make such a difference.

229
00:10:32,423 --> 00:10:35,092
Marky says that's not the way
we should make change.

230
00:10:35,176 --> 00:10:38,888
Oh, speaking of, do you mind
if I go through your couch cushions?

231
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:40,431
I'm sort of playing hooky from beg.

232
00:10:40,514 --> 00:10:43,476
Honey, I wish you'd take the rest
of this <i>tres leches</i> cake.

233
00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:45,936
It's from a dear Hispanic supporter

234
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:48,773
and I'll never get it into the bay
in one piece.

235
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:52,318
Honestly, Lucille 2,
you've been like a mother to me.

236
00:10:52,568 --> 00:10:55,821
Except kind and loving
and willing to let me eat.

237
00:10:56,405 --> 00:11:00,117
[narrator] <i>Lindsay knew she had to keep</i>
<i>her secret life of luxury hidden...</i>

238
00:11:00,368 --> 00:11:02,161
You're looking at Lindsay. Still Lindsay.

239
00:11:02,244 --> 00:11:04,121
[narrator]
<i>...from an anti-everything boyfriend</i>

240
00:11:04,205 --> 00:11:08,584
<i>who was preparing to squat in a podium</i>
<i>for three days with a paint bomb.</i>

241
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:10,544
...just to throw a pie
at Arnold Schwarzenegger.

242
00:11:10,628 --> 00:11:12,046
I never heard about that.

243
00:11:12,129 --> 00:11:13,881
Yeah, well, the press tried to spin it as,

244
00:11:13,964 --> 00:11:16,467
"Hippy tries to play pie tin Frisbee
with the governor,"

245
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:19,261
but... this time I'm eating beforehand.

246
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:22,223
Yeah, I see that.
Hey, can I get you a fork,

247
00:11:22,306 --> 00:11:24,725
'cause that's my brother
whose face you're licking.

248
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:26,560
That's a face?

249
00:11:28,396 --> 00:11:30,523
-Everything I do is wrong.
-Oh.

250
00:11:30,606 --> 00:11:33,109
I knew you wouldn't be on board with this.
I'm sorry to say this,

251
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:35,653
-but you are losing your passion.
-What passion?

252
00:11:35,736 --> 00:11:38,823
You don't even look at me.
I don't know if I've said this before,

253
00:11:38,906 --> 00:11:41,992
it's not important or anything,
but I am really, really pretty.

254
00:11:42,076 --> 00:11:43,536
I'm the straightest guy you know!

255
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:46,956
Why does every man
feel like they have to say that to me?

256
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:49,959
Quiet, Cindy's in heat! You know how much
she hates it when we argue.

257
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:53,045
Listen to me. This protest of mine
could really make a difference.

258
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:55,297
-It's gonna land you in jail.
-Oh, there it is.

259
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:57,383
Yeah, so that's it. You know what?

260
00:11:57,466 --> 00:12:00,428
You are just as selfish and money-hungry
as you ever were. Yes, you are.

261
00:12:00,511 --> 00:12:03,597
That's not true. Ooh, a Neiman's catalog.

262
00:12:04,181 --> 00:12:08,519
[narrator] <i>But it was what she found stuck</i>
<i>inside the catalog that got her attention.</i>

00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:12,857
"From Gangie for Facelift."

264
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:14,942
What a load of...

00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:17,570
-Mother!
-[narrator] <i>But after a year</i>

I'm here to see you about your son.

270
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:33,461
Oh, this is a ploy.
He's trying to get me to see him.

271
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:36,172
How do I know you're really in the army?

272
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:38,507
Who did Larry Kert replace in <i>Company?</i>

273
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:39,800
I don't know.

274
00:12:40,176 --> 00:12:43,471
I know who he thought he was replacing,
and it was Dean Jones.

275
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:45,014
But he didn't come close.

276
00:12:47,308 --> 00:12:48,350
My Buster?

277
00:12:53,647 --> 00:12:55,024
What happened? Where's my son?

278
00:12:55,733 --> 00:12:58,986
Mrs. Bluth, your son went down
while piloting a plane over Afghanistan.

279
00:12:59,069 --> 00:13:00,988
-Oh, my God.
-He deserves a big hand for that,

280
00:13:01,071 --> 00:13:02,406
and we gave him one.

281
00:13:02,948 --> 00:13:05,534
I'm afraid besides that,
there's nothing we can do.

282
00:13:10,706 --> 00:13:11,540
Hi, Mother.

283
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:14,043
You look fine.

284
00:13:14,126 --> 00:13:17,713
The doctor said you went down
while piloting a plane over Afghanistan.

285
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:19,965
Oh, yeah, that plane was in Afghanistan.

286

[narrator]
<i>He had been playing </i>for <i>47 straight hours.</i>

<i>to distinguish between games and reality</i>
<i>by making him a drone pilot.</i>

Hey, Bluth, you just took out
an art museum in Madrid.

295
00:13:48,619 --> 00:13:51,372
-You can go to Spain in this thing?
-Maybe you should take a break.

296

-You could've hurt some innocent people.
-Innocent people? [gasps]

297
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,127
You mean I've been hurting guilty people?!

-[narrator] <i>But Buster was a peaceful man</i>
-[screaming]

299

<i>-and didn't take well to this notion.</i>
-Pilot down!

300
00:14:02,716 --> 00:14:06,220
[narrator]<i> It was the kind of emergency</i>
<i>that the drone pilot paramedics</i>

301
00:14:06,303 --> 00:14:09,014
<i>-had long been waiting for.</i>
-I got a man down!

302
00:14:09,098 --> 00:14:11,809
Sorry we're late. Some kid
swallowed an eye at the Build-A-Bear.

303
00:14:12,393 --> 00:14:14,103
Why do they have us at a mini-mall?

304
00:14:14,728 --> 00:14:15,855
[narrator]<i> And next door,</i>

305
00:14:15,938 --> 00:14:18,858
<i>the top brass addressed it</i>
<i>at their four o'clock meeting.</i>

306
00:14:19,024 --> 00:14:21,485
Apparently no one told them
that they were real planes.

307
00:14:21,569 --> 00:14:22,862
If this guy comes after us,

308
00:14:22,945 --> 00:14:24,822
they could pull funding
for the whole program.

309
00:14:25,573 --> 00:14:27,575
So, how do we buy off Old One-Arm?

310
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,702
First we gotta find something he needs.

311
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:32,121
Well, we do have the bionics program.

312
00:14:32,204 --> 00:14:33,247
Ice cream!

313
00:14:34,415 --> 00:14:36,625
Maybe we shouldn't be
discussing this here.

314
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:40,588
-Damn these mini-malls.
-[Lucille] So you fell out of a chair

315
00:14:40,671 --> 00:14:42,673
and for this the government
gives you applause?

316
00:14:43,257 --> 00:14:44,633
No, a big hand.

317
00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:48,637
I thought I recognized
that little son of a bitch!

318
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:52,141
This is why you can't keep a job
in one hospital!

319
00:14:52,224 --> 00:14:54,226
You mislead people!

320
00:14:56,812 --> 00:14:58,397
Why does it have to be so big?

321
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:01,025
Well, they said the miniaturisation
comes later.

322
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:05,154
I mean, you remember how big
your first cellphone was?

324

You wouldn't come here any other way.

325

-You need to grow up, Buster.

329

I'm glad you have a new hand.

330
00:15:23,797 --> 00:15:25,883
But you need to find someone else
to hold it.

331
00:15:26,508 --> 00:15:28,552
Tell the prison limo to come around.

332
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:31,847
Fine! I got my own family now! Army!

333
00:15:32,097 --> 00:15:34,600
And they want me!
You guys want me, right?

334
00:15:34,683 --> 00:15:36,602
Oh, yeah. They're not gonna
invest this kind of money

335
00:15:36,685 --> 00:15:38,729
-without wanting you for keeps.
-[laughing]

336
00:15:38,812 --> 00:15:41,815
Once you learn how to use that thing,
they'll turn you into a killing monster.

337
00:15:42,274 --> 00:15:43,233
Monster?

338
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:46,070
Well, that explains the photo shoot.

Where am I going to get that money?

345

-Yeah, but that was put on hold.
-So? It's election time.

Isn't that dizzy kook
Lucille Austero running?

349
00:16:19,728 --> 00:16:23,148
No, she can't know about this.
She's a majority owner

350
00:16:23,357 --> 00:16:26,402
of my company, and besides,
she's so pro-immigrant.

351
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:28,779
What about the other guy, Herbert Love?

352
00:16:29,154 --> 00:16:30,906
Right? He's got a rally tonight.

353
00:16:31,156 --> 00:16:32,282
Go and see him.

354
00:16:32,574 --> 00:16:34,868
Everyone knows how persuasive you can be.

355
00:16:34,952 --> 00:16:35,953
Used to be.

356
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:40,332
I'll be lucky to sell a glass of lemonade
for $1,000 today.

357

358
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:51,552

359
00:16:51,635 --> 00:16:54,638
before, of course, what I owe in lawsuits,
you can talk a politician

360
