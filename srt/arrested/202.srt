00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:02,835
male narrator: NOW THE STORY 
OF A WEALTHY FAMILY

2
00:00:02,835 --> 00:00:04,004
WHO LOST EVERYTHING,

3
00:00:04,004 --> 00:00:06,172
AND THE ONE SON 
WHO HAD NO CHOICE

4
00:00:06,172 --> 00:00:08,841
BUT TO KEEP THEM ALL TOGETHER.

5
00:00:13,721 --> 00:00:16,724
IT'S "ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT."

6
00:00:18,643 --> 00:00:20,561
narrator: 
MICHAEL BLUTH WAS AT HOME

7
00:00:20,561 --> 00:00:22,813
WORKING ON A PLAN 
TO SAVE THE COMPANY.

8
00:00:22,813 --> 00:00:24,065
- HOW'S THIS 
FOR A BUSINESS MODEL?

9
00:00:24,065 --> 00:00:25,733
WE MAKE THE COMPANY 
LOOK LIKE IT'S IN THE BLACK

10
00:00:25,733 --> 00:00:27,568
BY STARTING CONSTRUCTION 
ON THE PHASE TWO DEVELOPMENT.

11
00:00:27,568 --> 00:00:28,611
NOW, I KNOW WHAT 
YOU'RE THINKING.

12
00:00:28,611 --> 00:00:29,654
WE'RE NOT IN THE BLACK.

13
00:00:29,654 --> 00:00:31,864
HOW'RE WE GONNA BUILD 30 HOUSES 
WITHOUT ANY MONEY?

14
00:00:31,864 --> 00:00:33,783
WE DON'T--WE BUILD ONE,

15
00:00:33,783 --> 00:00:35,535
THEN WE HAVE A HUGE 
RIBBON-CUTTING CEREMONY

16
00:00:35,535 --> 00:00:37,787
WHILE WE'RE THE RAISING FUNDS 
FOR THE OTHERS.

17
00:00:37,787 --> 00:00:39,539
narrator: 
MICHAEL'S FATHER ALWAYS UNVEILED

18
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:41,291
HIS CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS

19
00:00:41,291 --> 00:00:44,419
WITH A HIGHLY PUBLICIZED 
RIBBON-CUTTING CEREMONY.

20
00:00:44,419 --> 00:00:46,879
HE EVEN DID SO 
FOR THE PRISON HE BUILT,

21
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:49,632
AND, SOMEWHAT IRONICALLY, 
WOULD LATER OCCUPY.

22
00:00:49,632 --> 00:00:51,801
- THE ONLY DIFFERENCE IS THIS 
TIME I GET TO CUT THE RIBBON.

23
00:00:51,801 --> 00:00:53,511
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

24
00:00:53,511 --> 00:00:55,763
- THERE'S A CREAM 
WITH REAL DIAMONDS IN IT.

25
00:00:55,763 --> 00:00:57,390
I CAN ACTUALLY SMEAR DIAMONDS 
ON MY FACE,

26
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:59,725
AND IT'S ONLY $400 A TUB.

27
00:00:59,725 --> 00:01:03,438
THAT'S LIKE, WHAT, LIKE, 
A MILLION DIAMONDS FOR $400?

28
00:01:03,438 --> 00:01:04,689
- MM.

29
00:01:04,689 --> 00:01:05,731
- A MILLION 
[bleep] DIAMONDS.

30
00:01:05,731 --> 00:01:06,982
- OKAY.

31
00:01:06,982 --> 00:01:09,319
- IS SHE ON YOU 
ABOUT THAT DIAMOND CREAM?

32
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:10,570
- MY HUSBAND'S JEALOUS BECAUSE

33
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:12,280
SINCE WE DECIDED TO HAVE 
AN OPEN MARRIAGE,

34
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:14,365
I'VE BEEN DOING 
A LITTLE BETTER THAN HE HAS.

35
00:01:14,365 --> 00:01:16,451
- IT IS NOT A COMPETITION, 
LINDSAY.

36
00:01:16,451 --> 00:01:18,953
WE ARE DOING THIS 
TO SAVE OUR MARRIAGE.

37
00:01:18,953 --> 00:01:20,205
BUT I SHOULD BE TELLING YOU

38
00:01:20,205 --> 00:01:22,832
THAT I HAVE BEEN MEETING 
MY FAIR SHARE OF GROUPIES.

39
00:01:22,832 --> 00:01:25,418
OR SHOULD I SAY "BLUEPIES"?

40
00:01:25,418 --> 00:01:27,795
narrator: TOBIAS HAD RECENTLY 
AUDITIONED AS AN UNDERSTUDY

41
00:01:27,795 --> 00:01:30,673
FOR THE SILENT PERFORMANCE 
ART TRIO, THE BLUE MAN GROUP.

42
00:01:30,673 --> 00:01:36,596
- AND THIS IS "KIDS" 
FROM "BYE, BYE, BIRDIE."

43
00:01:36,596 --> 00:01:39,265
narrator: HE HAD YET TO HEAR 
BACK FROM THEM.

44
00:01:39,265 --> 00:01:40,808
- DO YOU GUYS REALLY THINK 
YOU HAVE THE GUTS

45
00:01:40,808 --> 00:01:42,727
TO GO THROUGH WITH THIS 
"SEEING OTHER PEOPLE" THING?

46
00:01:42,727 --> 00:01:44,562
narrator: IN FACT, NEITHER 
LINDSAY NOR TOBIAS

47
00:01:44,562 --> 00:01:46,731
DID HAVE THE GUTS TO GO 
THROUGH WITH IT.

48
00:01:46,731 --> 00:01:48,774
- I ALREADY HAVE. 
- I HAVE TOO.

49
00:01:48,774 --> 00:01:51,361
CAN I BUY YOU A DRINK? 
- NO.

50
00:01:51,361 --> 00:01:54,447
narrator: LINDSAY, BECAUSE 
SHE'D LOST HER SELF-CONFIDENCE.

51
00:01:54,447 --> 00:01:57,533
- I'D LIKE TO BUY YOU A DRINK. 
WHERE'S SHE GOING?

52
00:01:57,533 --> 00:01:59,160
narrator: AND TOBIAS, 
BECAUSE HE WAS BUSY

53
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:01,078
KEEPING AN EYE ON LINDSAY.

54
00:02:01,078 --> 00:02:03,498
- WHO ARE YOU GONNA BRING 
TO THIS RIBBON-CUTTING DANCE?

55
00:02:03,498 --> 00:02:05,166
- IT'S NOT A DANCE, 
AND YOU DON'T NEED A DATE.

56
00:02:05,166 --> 00:02:08,961
ALTHOUGH, GEORGE MICHAEL, 
I'D LOVE FOR YOU TO COME WITH ME

57
00:02:08,961 --> 00:02:10,671
WHEN I CUT THE RIBBON 
AT THE NEW HOUSE.

58
00:02:10,671 --> 00:02:12,715
- OH, WOW. 
HEY, CAN I BRING ANN?

59
00:02:12,715 --> 00:02:14,675
- WHO? 
- ANN.

60
00:02:14,675 --> 00:02:18,053
YOU KNOW, SHE'S--SHE'S THE GIRL 
I'M KINDA HANGING OUT WITH.

61
00:02:18,053 --> 00:02:19,555
- I HAVEN'T MET ANN. 
- YES, YOU HAVE.

62
00:02:19,555 --> 00:02:20,806
narrator: 
MICHAEL HAD MET ANN.

63
00:02:20,806 --> 00:02:24,269
- YOU LET HER IN.

64
00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:27,272
SEE, THAT'S HER 
RIGHT OVER THERE.

65
00:02:27,272 --> 00:02:28,523
- OH, ANN. 
YES, YES, YES, YES.

66
00:02:28,523 --> 00:02:30,107
YEAH. I KNOW ANN. 
HEY, YOU!

67
00:02:30,107 --> 00:02:33,444
SHE'S GOT A LITTLE 
HARD-BOILED EGG GOING THERE.

68
00:02:33,444 --> 00:02:34,695
- OH, IT'S SO CUTE.

69
00:02:34,695 --> 00:02:36,364
SHE SOMETIMES TAKES 
A LITTLE PACK OF MAYONNAISE,

70
00:02:36,364 --> 00:02:37,698
AND SHE'LL SQUIRT IT 
IN HER MOUTH,

71
00:02:37,698 --> 00:02:41,118
AND THEN SHE'LL TAKE AN EGG 
AND KIND OF--MMM.

72
00:02:41,118 --> 00:02:43,913
SHE CALLS IT A MAYONN-EGG.

73
00:02:43,913 --> 00:02:46,249
ARE YOU OKAY? 
- I DON'T FEEL SO GOOD.

74
00:02:46,249 --> 00:02:48,876
- YOU KNOW, I KIND OF WANT 
TO BUY HER A DIAMOND.

75
00:02:48,876 --> 00:02:51,462
- HER? 
- ANN.

76
00:02:51,462 --> 00:02:52,713
I MEAN, 
I KNOW I CAN'T AFFORD IT,

77
00:02:52,713 --> 00:02:54,507
BUT AUNT LINDSAY WAS TELLING ME 
ABOUT THIS DIAMOND CREAM.

78
00:02:54,507 --> 00:02:56,801
- GEORGE MICHAEL, I'M SURE 
THAT EGG IS A VERY NICE PERSON.

79
00:02:56,801 --> 00:02:59,929
I JUST DON'T WANT YOU SPENDING-- 
- IT'S ANN. HER NA--

80
00:02:59,929 --> 00:03:02,265
- ALL YOUR MONEY GETTING HER 
ALL GLITTERED UP FOR EASTER,

81
00:03:02,265 --> 00:03:03,349
YOU KNOW?

82
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:04,934
MORE IMPORTANTLY, 
I WANT US TO DO THIS TOGETHER.

83
00:03:04,934 --> 00:03:07,270
KINDA LIKE A FATHER-SON 
SORT OF THING, YOU KNOW?

84
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:10,940
AND SINCE POP-POP IS NO LONGER 
PRESIDENT, WE GET TO DO IT.

85
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:12,191
- BUT I THOUGHT GOB 
WAS PRESIDENT NOW.

86
00:03:12,191 --> 00:03:14,527
- YEAH, AND I DON'T HAVE 
ANY PROBLEM WITH THAT.

87
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:15,778
narrator: 
IN FACT,

88
00:03:15,778 --> 00:03:17,488
SINCE MICHAEL'S FATHER ESCAPED 
FROM PRISON,

89
00:03:17,488 --> 00:03:21,659
HIS BROTHER GOB HAD BEEN MADE 
PRESIDENT, ALBEIT IN NAME ONLY.

90
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:22,993
WHICH IS WHY MICHAEL 
WAS SURPRISED

91
00:03:22,993 --> 00:03:25,288
WHEN HE GOT TO WORK 
THE NEXT DAY.

92
00:03:25,288 --> 00:03:26,539
- YOU'RE STILL IN MY OFFICE.

93
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:28,207
- GOSH, MICHAEL, 
I AM KIND OF THE PRESIDENT.

94
00:03:28,207 --> 00:03:29,459
- AND I HAVE NO PROBLEM 
WITH THAT.

95
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:31,085
BUT IT IS 
JUST A TITLE, REMEMBER?

96
00:03:31,085 --> 00:03:32,878
YOU KNOW, JUST DOING THIS 
TO APPEASE THE STOCKHOLDERS

97
00:03:32,878 --> 00:03:34,547
WHILE THEY SCRUTINIZE ME 
FOR DAD'S CRIMES.

98
00:03:34,547 --> 00:03:36,131
- HEY, LOOK, DAD MAY HAVE 
ILLEGALLY BUILT

99
00:03:36,131 --> 00:03:38,926
SOME HOMES IN IRAQ, 
WHICH IS KINDA NOT COOL.

100
00:03:38,926 --> 00:03:41,053
- I KNOW, BUT THAT'S WHY 
I'VE GOT A BUSINESS MODEL

101
00:03:41,053 --> 00:03:43,723
THAT I THINK IS GOING TO RESTORE 
THE IMAGE OF OUR COMPANY.

102
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:45,683
WE'RE GOING TO BUILD 
A SECOND MODEL HOME.

103
00:03:45,683 --> 00:03:47,935
- THAT'S GREAT. 
CAN I ANNOUNCE IT TO THE BOARD?

104
00:03:47,935 --> 00:03:49,979
- GEE, IT IS MY BUSINESS MODEL.

105
00:03:49,979 --> 00:03:51,772
IF YOU HAD A BUSINESS MODEL, 
THEN BY ALL MEANS,

106
00:03:51,772 --> 00:03:53,023
GO IN THERE 
AND DO YOUR LITTLE DANCE.

107
00:03:53,023 --> 00:03:55,150
- TELL YOU WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO. 
ROCK, PAPER, SCISSORS FOR IT.

108
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:56,611
- NO, NO, I'M NOT INTERESTED 
IN DOING--

109
00:03:56,611 --> 00:03:57,612
- ONE, TWO, THREE.

110
00:03:57,612 --> 00:03:58,863
PAPER COVERS ROCK.

111
00:03:58,863 --> 00:04:01,073
- IT IS A ROCK, THOUGH. 
IT SHOULD BEAT EVERYTHING.

112
00:04:01,073 --> 00:04:02,325
- THERE'S NOT A LOT OF LOGIC 
TO IT.

113
00:04:02,325 --> 00:04:05,245
IT'S LIKE ON A BOAT 
WITH "WOMEN AND CHILDREN FIRST."

114
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:06,496
WHY SHOULD THEY--

115
00:04:06,496 --> 00:04:09,249
WHICH, BEFORE I FORGET, 
I'M BUYING A COMPANY BOAT.

116
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:11,292
- SORRY?

117
00:04:11,292 --> 00:04:13,336
narrator: THAT MORNING, 
GOB HAD GONE TO A BOAT SHOW,

118
00:04:13,336 --> 00:04:14,629
WHERE HE SAW SOMETHING 
HE WANTED.

119
00:04:14,629 --> 00:04:17,298
- HELLO. 
- HI.

120
00:04:17,298 --> 00:04:19,091
- WHAT A BEAUTY. 
- THANK YOU.

121
00:04:19,091 --> 00:04:21,677
- I MEANT YOU. 
- WELL.

122
00:04:21,677 --> 00:04:23,346
narrator: GOB FLIRTED 
WITH HER FOR A WHILE

123
00:04:23,346 --> 00:04:25,306
AND FINALLY ASKED 
FOR HER NUMBER.

124
00:04:25,306 --> 00:04:26,557
- LET'S GET SOME DIGITS.

125
00:04:26,557 --> 00:04:29,310
- I'M SORRY, I DON'T GIVE IT OUT 
WITHOUT A FIRM OFFER.

126
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:32,187
- OH, I'LL MAKE YOU 
A FIRM OFFER.

127
00:04:32,187 --> 00:04:34,357
narrator: UNFORTUNATELY, 
SHE WASN'T FLIRTING.

128
00:04:34,357 --> 00:04:38,068
- AND HERE AGAIN, PLEASE.

129
00:04:38,068 --> 00:04:40,988
- THE SEAWARD. 
- YOU'RE NOT GETTING A BOAT.

130
00:04:40,988 --> 00:04:43,949
- ONE, TWO, THREE. 
- NOPE, NOT GONNA DO IT.

131
00:04:43,949 --> 00:04:46,536
- PAPER COVERS ROCK. 
- FINE. BUT ROCK SINKS BOAT.

132
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:47,787
- MICHAEL?

133
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:49,289
- MOM, I'M RIGHT 
IN THE MIDDLE OF SOMETHING.

134
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:50,831
GET RID OF THE SEAWARD.

135
00:04:50,831 --> 00:04:54,335
- I'LL LEAVE WHEN 
I'M GOOD AND READY.

136
00:04:54,335 --> 00:04:58,255
IT'S ABOUT YOUR UNCLE OSCAR. 
I WANT HIM TO MOVE IN WITH YOU.

137
00:04:58,255 --> 00:05:00,174
- YOU'RE NOT KICKING HIM OUT 
ALREADY, ARE YOU?

138
00:05:00,174 --> 00:05:02,051
narrator: MICHAEL'S UNCLE 
HAD RECENTLY MOVED

139
00:05:02,051 --> 00:05:03,469
INTO LUCILLE'S APARTMENT,

140
00:05:03,469 --> 00:05:06,972
WHERE THEY QUICKLY REKINDLED 
A LONG-DORMANT ROMANCE.

141
00:05:06,972 --> 00:05:08,308
IT WAS A SECRET 
SHE HOPED TO KEEP--

142
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:10,267
- OSCAR, WE'LL BE HEARD.

143
00:05:10,267 --> 00:05:11,519
narrator: AND HE DIDN'T.

144
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:12,978
- THAT'S WHAT MAKES IT SO HOT.

145
00:05:12,978 --> 00:05:15,147
- MOTHER?

146
00:05:15,147 --> 00:05:18,318
MOTHER!

147
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:21,278
I HEARD ZOO NOISES. 
- IT'S NOTHING. GO BACK TO BED.

148
00:05:21,278 --> 00:05:27,159
- SO EVERYBODY'S STILL UP, HUH?

149
00:05:27,159 --> 00:05:29,078
- [whimpering]

150
00:05:29,078 --> 00:05:31,956
- IT'S NOT FAIR TO BUSTER. 
HE'S A NERVOUS WRECK RIGHT NOW.

151
00:05:31,956 --> 00:05:34,584
HE'S GOING INTO THE ARMY, 
FOR GOD'S SAKE.

152
00:05:34,584 --> 00:05:37,169
- YOU VOLUNTEERED HIM.

153
00:05:37,169 --> 00:05:40,381
- I KNEW YOU WERE GOING TO 
THROW THAT IN MY FACE.

154
00:05:40,381 --> 00:05:41,632
- WELL, DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT, 
OKAY?

155
00:05:41,632 --> 00:05:42,758
THEY'RE NEVER GONNA 
TAKE HIM ANYWAY.

156
00:05:42,758 --> 00:05:44,009
narrator: 
AT THAT MOMENT,

157
00:05:44,009 --> 00:05:46,095
BUSTER WAS TAKING HIS PHYSICAL 
AT THE RECRUITMENT CENTER.

158
00:05:46,095 --> 00:05:47,346
- I HAVE A HOLE 
IN MY HEART.

159
00:05:47,346 --> 00:05:49,599
I'VE NEVER OPENED MY EYES 
UNDERWATER.

160
00:05:49,599 --> 00:05:51,851
MY [whispers] 
REPRODUCTIVE ORGAN

161
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:54,061
IS SHAPED LIKE [whispers] 
A LOBSTER TAIL,

162
00:05:54,061 --> 00:05:56,647
BUT WITHOUT ITS SHELL, 
HMM?

163
00:05:56,647 --> 00:05:59,024
OH, I GUESS I HAVE THE PANIC 
ATTACKS UNDER CONTROL.

- HEY, WHY DON'T YOU 
VOLUNTEER OSCAR?

170
00:06:11,537 --> 00:06:12,705
THAT WOULD SOLVE 
BOTH OF YOUR PROBLEMS.

171
00:06:12,705 --> 00:06:15,040

A RIBBON-CUTTING

THE COMBINATION 
OF THE TWO OF US WOULD BE?

186
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:48,157
I MEAN, WE'RE ALL OUT OF 
"PROPHYLACTICOS" ANYWAY.

187

SOMEBODY USED THE LAST TWO

YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE WHO CAN SAVE 
THE FAMILY,

BUT YOU GOTTA KEEP 
THE COMPANY STRONG,

196
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:06,717
BECAUSE I'M GONNA NEED 
SOME OF THAT MONEY LATER.

197
00:07:06,717 --> 00:07:07,968

TALK TO ME?

211
00:07:32,702 --> 00:07:35,996
- NO, HE WANTED TO TALK 
TO THE PRESIDENT.

212
00:07:35,996 --> 00:07:37,247

THEY DIDN'T THINK THERE WAS 
ENOUGH WRONG WITH ME.

CHECK EVERYTHING?

MY CHARLIE BROWNS.

YOU LIED TO ME. 
YOU SAID I WASN'T FIT TO SERVE.

LET'S CALM DOWN, PEOPLE.

UM, I THINK I KNOW A LITTLE BIT 
ABOUT AVOIDING COMBAT DUTY.

THE PRESIDENT,

IF WE START CONSTRUCTION 
ON A SECOND MODEL HOME,

WE CAN BE CUTTING THIS RIBBON

CAN WE STOP THE MUSIC?

258
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:47,252
I'M NOT AS OPTIMISTIC 
THAT WE CAN GET THAT DONE.

259
00:09:47,252 --> 00:09:50,631
GOB, I THINK WE BOTH AGREE THAT 
WE WOULD DO THINGS YOUR WAY

260
00:09:50,631 --> 00:09:52,842
IF YOU HAD 
A BUSINESS MODEL.

261
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:55,678
DO YOU HAVE 
A BUSINESS MODEL, GOB?

262
00:09:55,678 --> 00:09:58,097

THAT YOU ASKED ME THAT, MICHAEL,

ALSO, I'M NOT SO SURE 
HOW "SOLID AS A ROCK"

276

HELPS PEOPLE FORGET THE FACT 
THAT WE BUILT HOUSES IN IRAQ.

- BUT YOU PROBABLY KNOW BEST 
BECAUSE YOU'RE PRESIDENT.

- WE DON'T HAVE TO BUILD 
A REAL HOUSE, MICHAEL.

280
00:10:42,182 --> 00:10:44,351
LIKE YOU SAID, 
IT'S ALL FOR APPEARANCES ANYWAY.

A CREW TO BUILD IT.

THEY'D LOSE THEIR LICENSES.

285

YOURSELF, DAMN IT!

HEY, THERE SHE IS, 
MY LITTLE BUSINESS MODEL.

I WON'T CHASE AFTER YOU.

"WHERE'S YOUR HUSBAND?"

BECAUSE I AM HERE. 
I AM REAL.

I AM FLESH AND BLOOD.

NOT AVAILABLE?

A LAST-MINUTE CREW TOGETHER.

LINDSAY, YOUR INABILITY 
TO GET A MAN INTERESTED

316
00:12:02,847 --> 00:12:04,098
IS NOT AT THE TOP OF MY LIST.

00:12:25,535 --> 00:12:27,621
AND DECIDED THAT PERHAPS 
SHE COULD OVERCOME HER PRIDE

328
00:12:27,621 --> 00:12:29,581
AND HELP SOMEONE TOO.

329
00:12:29,581 --> 00:12:31,208
- I'VE GOT SOMEONE 
FOR YOUR CREW, MICHAEL.

330
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:34,503
MY BOYFRIEND, THE HOMELESS GUY.

331
00:12:34,503 --> 00:12:36,088
I WONDER IF HE EVEN 
HAS AN APARTMENT OR--

332
00:12:36,088 --> 00:12:38,007
[phone ringing]

333
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:40,843
- HELLO? 
- DID YOU SEE THE NEWS?

334
00:12:40,843 --> 00:12:43,595
YOUR UNCLE OSCAR FORCED HIMSELF 
ON ME AT THE BEACH TODAY,

335
00:12:43,595 --> 00:12:44,847
AND I DIDN'T HAVE MY HORN.

336
00:12:44,847 --> 00:12:47,016
- OF COURSE. 
IT WAS UNCLE OSCAR.

337
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:49,018
MOM, YOU'RE NOT HAVING 
AN AFFAIR WITH HIM, ARE YOU?

338
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:51,728
- YOU'RE BUILDING A HOUSE. 
I WANT YOU TO GIVE IT TO HIM.

339
00:12:51,728 --> 00:12:55,149
- IT'S NOT A REAL HOUSE. 
- PERFECT. HE'S NOT A REAL MAN.

340
00:12:55,149 --> 00:12:57,985
narrator: AND GEORGE SR. MADE 
HIS CASE TO THE MEXICAN POLICE.

341
00:12:57,985 --> 00:12:59,736
- MY GOD, I WAS BEATEN UP HERE. 
I'M TELLING YOU.

342
00:12:59,736 --> 00:13:01,280
I'M GEORGE. 
I'M NOT OSCAR. I'M GEORGE.

343
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,656
- THE CORNBALLER.

344
00:13:02,656 --> 00:13:05,284
- SI, THE CORNBALLER.

345
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:06,994
narrator: GEORGE SR. 
HAD MARKETED A DEVICE

346
00:13:06,994 --> 00:13:11,456
CALLED THE CORNBALLER IN MEXICO 
AFTER THE SEVERE BURNS IT CAUSED

347
00:13:11,456 --> 00:13:13,625
LED TO IT BEING BANNED 
IN THE U.S.

348
00:13:13,625 --> 00:13:17,671
- WHY, DID YOU HAVE ONE? 
- SI.

349
00:13:21,633 --> 00:13:23,468
narrator: LINDSAY, MEANWHILE, 
WAS HAVING TROUBLE

350
00:13:23,468 --> 00:13:24,511
FINDING HER HOMELESS MAN.

351
00:13:24,511 --> 00:13:25,762
- HE LOOKED LIKE A MOVIE STAR.

352
00:13:25,762 --> 00:13:27,389
narrator: IN FACT, 
THE MAN LOOKED LIKE A MOVIE STAR

353
00:13:27,389 --> 00:13:28,974
BECAUSE HE WAS A MOVIE STAR.

354
00:13:28,974 --> 00:13:30,225
HIS NAME WAS TOM JANE,

355
00:13:30,225 --> 00:13:32,727
AND HE WAS MAKING TWO MOVIES 
FOR A MAJOR STUDIO.

356
00:13:32,727 --> 00:13:36,023
ONE WAS A GRITTY PERSONAL 
PROJECT ABOUT A JUNKIE'S LIFE,

357
00:13:36,023 --> 00:13:38,692
WHICH HE ONLY GOT TO DO 
IN EXCHANGE FOR MAKING

358
00:13:38,692 --> 00:13:41,570
A RIGIDLY 
FORMULAIC POPCORN MOVIE.

359
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:43,613
HE WAS LIVING ON THE STREETS, 
RESEARCHING HIS ROLE.

360
00:13:43,613 --> 00:13:44,823
- HEY, HOMELESS GUY. 
- HEY.

361
00:13:44,823 --> 00:13:48,077
- I'M NOT PROUD OF THE WAY 
I WAS SO GROSSED OUT

362
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:50,079
WHEN I FOUND OUT 
YOU WERE GROSS BEFORE.

363
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:52,122
- YOU REALLY THOUGHT 
I WAS GROSS, HUH?

364
00:13:52,122 --> 00:13:53,958
- WELL, AT FIRST, I THOUGHT 
YOU WERE KIND OF HOT,

365
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:56,168
BUT I HADN'T LOOKED 
CLOSELY ENOUGH.

366
00:13:56,168 --> 00:13:59,129
LISTEN, I HAVE 
A CONSTRUCTION JOB FOR YOU.

367
00:13:59,129 --> 00:14:01,340
AND IF YOU CLEAN YOURSELF UP, 
WHO KNOWS?

368
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:05,135
YOU MIGHT ACTUALLY 
GET A DATE OUT OF THIS.

369
00:14:05,135 --> 00:14:08,763
OKAY. 
- SEE YA.

370
00:14:11,725 --> 00:14:15,312
- OKAY, WE'VE ALL MADE 
SOME SACRIFICES TO BE HERE,

371
00:14:15,312 --> 00:14:16,855
BUT WE ALL WANT THE SAME THING.

372
00:14:16,855 --> 00:14:18,107
- I WANNA LIVE HERE.

373
00:14:18,107 --> 00:14:20,067
- I WANNA BUY ANN 
SOME DIAMOND DUST.

374
00:14:20,067 --> 00:14:21,610
- I'M JUST HOPING 
TO GET MILDLY INJURED,

375
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:23,403
SO I CAN GET OUT OF THE ARMY.

376
00:14:23,403 --> 00:14:25,990
- BOTTOM LINE IS WE'VE GOT 
TWO WEEKS TO BUILD A HOUSE.

377
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:28,325
IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE GOOD. 
IT JUST HAS TO LOOK GOOD.

378
00:14:28,325 --> 00:14:32,287
- I JUST WANT MY KIDS BACK.

379
00:14:32,287 --> 00:14:36,166
narrator: AND SO 
THE GUYS WENT TO WORK.

380
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:37,417
- [grunting]

381
00:14:37,417 --> 00:14:39,211
[chattering]

382
00:14:39,211 --> 00:14:44,133
narrator: THINGS DIDN'T GO 
SMOOTHLY AT FIRST.

383
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:47,761
BUSTER LOOKED FOR WAYS 
TO HURT HIMSELF.

384
00:14:51,556 --> 00:14:54,059
BUT SOON THE PROJECT 
CAME TOGETHER

385
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:57,729
WHEN GOB STOPPED BY.

386
00:14:57,729 --> 00:14:59,731
- NOW WE'RE BUILDING A HOUSE.

387
00:14:59,731 --> 00:15:00,983
- YEAH, I'M PRETTY PROUD--

388
00:15:00,983 --> 00:15:03,360
- SO, WHAT DO YOU THINK? 
DID I DO THIS OR WHAT?

389
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,362
- SEEMS LIKE 
YOUR BROTHER DID IT.

390
00:15:05,362 --> 00:15:06,738
- MY BROTHER DOES 
WHAT I TELL HIM TO DO.

391
00:15:06,738 --> 00:15:09,158
I'M THE PRESIDENT.

392
00:15:09,158 --> 00:15:10,200
- WHERE'S YOUR "P"?

393
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:12,912
- WHAT? 
OH, NO, NOT AGAIN.

394
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:14,955
- I GOT IT. 
- [groans]

395
00:15:14,955 --> 00:15:16,206
HEY, SORRY FOR THE

396
00:15:16,206 --> 00:15:18,458
"MY BROTHER DOES WHAT I TELL HIM 
TO DO" CRAP,

397
00:15:18,458 --> 00:15:19,709
BUT I WANT THIS TO BE PERFECT

398
00:15:19,709 --> 00:15:20,877
FOR WHEN I CUT 
THE RIBBON TOMORROW.

399
00:15:20,877 --> 00:15:22,922
- YOU'RE CUTTING THE RIBBON?

400
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:25,424
I KINDA THOUGHT 
THAT SINCE I BUILT IT,

401
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:26,425
I MIGHT GO AHEAD 
AND GIVE IT A--

402
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:27,551
- YEAH, OKAY.

403
00:15:27,551 --> 00:15:30,304
CAN YOU IMAGINE HOW THAT WOULD 
LOOK TO THE BOARD?

404
00:15:30,304 --> 00:15:32,097
THE CONSTRUCTION WORKER 
CUTTING THE RIBBON.

405
00:15:32,097 --> 00:15:34,599
NO, NO, THAT'S A JOB 
FOR THE PRESIDENT.

406
00:15:34,599 --> 00:15:36,768
narrator: 
MICHAEL HAD A PROBLEM WITH THAT.

407
00:15:36,768 --> 00:15:38,728
GOB HAD TAKEN AWAY SOMETHING 
MICHAEL ALWAYS WANTED.

408
00:15:38,728 --> 00:15:39,771
- YOU GOT THE "P."

409
00:15:39,771 --> 00:15:41,148
narrator: 
NOW IT WAS MICHAEL'S TURN

410
00:15:41,148 --> 00:15:43,692
TO TAKE SOMETHING FROM GOB-- 
STARLA.

411
00:15:43,692 --> 00:15:48,280
AND LATER, MICHAEL 
SET ABOUT HIS PLAN.

412
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:50,407
- GOB, DO YOU HAVE 
STARLA'S PHONE NUMBER?

413
00:15:50,407 --> 00:15:51,658
I GOT A FEW BUSINESS THINGS

414
00:15:51,658 --> 00:15:52,952
I'D LIKE TO GO OVER 
WITH THE BUSINESS MODEL.

415
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:57,247
- GUESS WHO WAS JUST OVER HER? 
DON'T, I'LL TELL YOU--ME.

416
00:15:57,247 --> 00:15:59,916
- HMM? 
- I [bleep] THE BUSINESS MODEL.

417
00:15:59,916 --> 00:16:01,626
narrator: 
ACTUALLY, THEY JUST MADE OUT.

418
00:16:01,626 --> 00:16:04,588
- YEAH, SHE HAD 
ALL KINDS OF ORGASMS.

419
00:16:04,588 --> 00:16:05,839
IMAGINE THAT.

420
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:07,549
I FINALLY NAILED SOMEBODY 
THAT YOU WEREN'T AFTER.

421
00:16:07,549 --> 00:16:08,800
- ALL RIGHT, THAT'S IT.

422
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,052
I'VE WORKED TOO HARD 
AND TOO LONG

423
00:16:10,052 --> 00:16:11,428
FOR YOU TO KEEP GETTING 
ALL THE CREDIT.

424
00:16:11,428 --> 00:16:12,721
I BUILT THAT COMPANY. 
I BUILT THAT HOUSE.

425
00:16:12,721 --> 00:16:13,888
AND I'M GONNA 
BE CUTTING THE RIBBON,

426
00:16:13,888 --> 00:16:16,641
WHETHER WE'RE ALL PRETENDING 
THAT YOU'RE PRESIDENT OR NOT.

427
00:16:16,641 --> 00:16:18,810
- YEAH, SURE. 
I JUST WANTED--

428
00:16:18,810 --> 00:16:20,312
- YOU JUST WANTED WHAT?

429
00:16:20,312 --> 00:16:22,897
- I JUST WANTED YOU 
TO BE IMPRESSED WITH ME.

430
00:16:22,897 --> 00:16:24,691
DAD NEVER WAS.

431
00:16:24,691 --> 00:16:26,901
NEVER SAID A NICE THING 
ABOUT ME.

432
00:16:26,901 --> 00:16:29,654
- HE CALLED YOU THE OTHER DAY. 
HE DIDN'T EVEN WANNA TALK TO ME.

433
00:16:29,654 --> 00:16:31,490
- OF COURSE HE DID!

434
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:33,950
HE NEVER WANTS TO TALK TO ME. 
HE NEVER HAS.

435
00:16:38,955 --> 00:16:40,957
- CUT THE RIBBON. 
- REALLY?

436
00:16:40,957 --> 00:16:42,959
- YEAH. HOW ABOUT THAT? 
- MICHAEL.

437
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:45,087
- I HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH IT.

438
00:16:45,087 --> 00:16:47,047
ALL RIGHT? 
TAKE IT EASY.

439
00:16:47,047 --> 00:16:49,341
- THANK YOU. 
- COME ON.

440
00:16:50,884 --> 00:16:52,886
narrator: THE NEXT DAY, 
THE BLUTH FAMILY PREPARED

441
00:16:52,886 --> 00:16:54,804
TO UNVEIL PHASE TWO.

442
00:16:54,804 --> 00:16:55,805
- HAVE YOU SEEN 
YOUR UNCLE GOB AROUND?

443
00:16:55,805 --> 00:16:57,266
- NO, AND I CAN'T FIND 
THAT DIAMOND DUST

444
00:16:57,266 --> 00:16:58,767
THAT AUNT LINDSAY BOUGHT FOR ME.

445
00:16:58,767 --> 00:17:02,521
- OH, WELL, YOUR AUNT LINDSAY 
HAS PROBABLY TAKEN IT.

446
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:04,023
SHE'S JUST A TAKER.

447
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:05,274
- THIS IS YOUR CHANCE, HUH?

448
00:17:05,274 --> 00:17:06,858
WITH THE BIG RIBBON-CUTTERS 
AFTER ALL THESE YEARS?

449
00:17:06,858 --> 00:17:09,194
- WELL, ACTUALLY, I FIGURED, 
GIVE GOB A CHANCE, YOU KNOW?

450
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:10,945
THE GUY DOESN'T GET A WHOLE LOT 
OF ATTENTION IN THIS FAMILY.

451
00:17:10,945 --> 00:17:12,114
- LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,

452
00:17:12,114 --> 00:17:17,994
THE PRESIDENT OF 
THE BLUTH COMPANY, GOB BLUTH.

453
00:17:17,994 --> 00:17:22,041
- MY BROTHER WASN'T OPTIMISTIC 
IT COULD BE DONE.

454
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:26,170
BUT I DIDN'T TAKE "WASN'T 
OPTIMISTIC IT COULD BE DONE"

455
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:30,465
FOR AN ANSWER.

456
00:17:30,465 --> 00:17:32,008
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, 
I PRESENT TO YOU

457
00:17:32,008 --> 00:17:34,344
PHASE TWO 
OF THE BLUTH COMPANY.

A HOUSE TRULY 
SOLID AS A ROCK.

00:17:38,307 --> 00:17:40,350
[applause]

460
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:42,686

SOLID AS A ROCK

00:17:43,937 --> 00:17:44,979
narrator: 
BUT AS IT TURNS OUT,

463
00:17:44,979 --> 00:17:49,193
MICHAEL WAS RIGHT TO NOT BE 
OPTIMISTIC IT COULD BE DONE.

464
00:17:49,193 --> 00:17:51,695
[people screaming]

465
00:17:51,695 --> 00:17:55,532
narrator: AND BUSTER SAW 
THE CHANCE TO GET INJURED ENOUGH

466
00:17:55,532 --> 00:17:59,619
TO KEEP HIM OUT OF THE ARMY.

467
00:17:59,619 --> 00:18:00,870
- [whimpering]

468
00:18:00,870 --> 00:18:04,791
narrator: BUT INSTEAD, 
GOT A GLIMPSE INSIDE.

469
00:18:04,791 --> 00:18:06,251
- I CAN'T LOOK AT THAT.

470
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:08,295
narrator: 
UNFORTUNATELY, TOBIAS HAD TO.

471
00:18:08,295 --> 00:18:09,879
- I GOT THE WRONG HOMELESS MAN. 
I AM SORRY.

472
00:18:09,879 --> 00:18:12,132
I WAS LOOKING FOR LINDSAY.

473
00:18:12,132 --> 00:18:13,383
- YOU LIED TO ME.

474
00:18:13,383 --> 00:18:16,136
YOU BOTH LIED TO ME. 
I'M GOING TO WAR.

475
00:18:16,136 --> 00:18:19,639
- BUSTER, YOU CAN'T! 
- YES, I CAN.

476
00:18:19,639 --> 00:18:22,101
I DON'T AGREE 
WITH YOUR DIRTY DOINGS HERE,

477
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:26,605
BUT I WILL DEFEND WITH MY LIFE 
YOUR RIGHT TO DO IT.

478
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:28,398
- YOU PLANNED THIS ALL ALONG, 
DIDN'T YOU, MICHAEL?

479
00:18:28,398 --> 00:18:30,109
- NO, I DIDN'T. 
I HAD NO CREW. I HAD NO TIME.

480
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:32,236
- YOU SET ME UP.

481
00:18:32,236 --> 00:18:35,071
narrator: GOB CHARGED AT MICHAEL 
WITH THE SCISSORS,

482
00:18:35,071 --> 00:18:37,949
BUT MICHAEL, AS HE ALWAYS DID, 
PICKED ROCK.

483
00:18:37,949 --> 00:18:39,159
- YOU WANTED TO MAKE ME 
LOOK FOOLISH!

484
00:18:39,159 --> 00:18:40,285
- PUT DOWN THE SCISSORS.

485
00:18:40,285 --> 00:18:43,288
- PUT 'EM DOWN. 
- FOOLISH WITH SCISSORS!

486
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:47,209
narrator: 
WHICH BEAT SCISSORS.

487
00:18:47,209 --> 00:18:48,460
UNFORTUNATELY,

488
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:50,504
THE WHOLE INCIDENT 
WAS COVERED BY THE PAPER.

489
00:18:50,504 --> 00:18:52,547
- NOBODY LOOKS GOOD IN THIS.

490
00:18:52,547 --> 00:18:53,798
- ESPECIALLY THAT LITTLE DUDE.

491
00:18:53,798 --> 00:18:56,301
- THAT'S ANN.

492
00:18:56,301 --> 00:18:58,220
- WHO'S-- 
- IT DOESN'T MATTER. LISTEN.

493
00:18:58,220 --> 00:18:59,554
YOU KNOW I DIDN'T SET YOU UP, 
OKAY?

494
00:18:59,554 --> 00:19:01,848
AND I REALLY THINK THE ONLY 
REASON YOU AND I ALWAYS FIGHT

495
00:19:01,848 --> 00:19:03,183
IS THAT SINCE WE WERE 
LITTLE KIDS,

496
00:19:03,183 --> 00:19:04,559
DAD'S ALWAYS PLAYED US 
OFF EACH OTHER.

497
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:05,810
- DAD ALWAYS SAID 
THAT WAS YOUR FAULT.

498
00:19:05,810 --> 00:19:08,897
- ANYWAY, WHAT WE OUGHT TO DO 
IS MAKE A DECISION RIGHT NOW

499
00:19:08,897 --> 00:19:10,857
NOT TO LET DAD GET IN THE MIDDLE 
OF OUR RELATIONSHIP ANYMORE.

500
00:19:10,857 --> 00:19:12,609
I MEAN, HE'S NOT EVEN IN TOWN, 
AND WE'RE FIGHTING.

501
00:19:12,609 --> 00:19:14,110
- WE'RE GROWN MEN.

502
00:19:14,110 --> 00:19:15,529
- YEAH, LET'S JUST MOVE ON. 
- LOOK AT ME.

503
00:19:15,529 --> 00:19:17,489
I'M THE PRESIDENT 
OF A COMPANY NOW.

504
00:19:17,489 --> 00:19:18,657
[phone ringing]

505
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:20,575
- OH, THAT'S DAD'S LINE. 
I BET HE SAW THE PAPER.

506
00:19:20,575 --> 00:19:21,826
- LISTEN, IF YOU WANT 
MY RESPECT,

507
00:19:21,826 --> 00:19:23,620
YOU WON'T ANSWER THAT, OKAY?

508
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:25,664
IT'S JUST GONNA 
CAUSE MORE PROBLEMS.

509
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:27,957
[disconnection tone]

510
00:19:27,957 --> 00:19:32,003
- HELLO? 
THEY HUNG UP.

511
00:19:32,003 --> 00:19:34,464
THEY HUNG UP ON ME. 
HIYA, GUYS.

512
00:19:34,464 --> 00:19:36,841
I COULDN'T GET THE MONEY. 
I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED.

513
00:19:36,841 --> 00:19:38,885
- I'M IMPRESSED YOU HUNG UP. 
- DID I HANG UP?

514
00:19:38,885 --> 00:19:41,054
I MEANT TO HIT SPEAKER. 
- OH.

515
00:19:41,054 --> 00:19:42,306
YOU GOTTA HIT THE LINE FIRST.

516
00:19:42,306 --> 00:19:43,557
- I'M HITTING BOTH 
AT THE SAME TIME.

517
00:19:43,557 --> 00:19:44,766
- THESE ARE THE LINES. 
THERE'S A LINE HERE.

518
00:19:44,766 --> 00:19:45,809
BUT SHE SAID-- 
IT'S LINE AND THEN--

519
00:19:45,809 --> 00:19:47,769
- GOB, HEY.

520
00:19:47,769 --> 00:19:50,897
I DON'T WANNA WAIT UNTIL DAD'S 
DEAD FOR US TO GET ALONG.

521
00:19:50,897 --> 00:19:53,233
narrator: 
BUT IT WAS TOO LATE,

522
00:19:53,233 --> 00:19:56,195
AS GEORGE SR. WOULD BE 
DECLARED DEAD

523
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:58,655
WITHIN THE HOUR.

524
00:19:58,655 --> 00:20:00,031
- FROM NOW ON, 
WE SUPPORT EACH OTHER.

525
00:20:00,031 --> 00:20:02,284
- WE START WITH A CLEAN SLATE. 
- YEAH.

526
00:20:02,284 --> 00:20:04,118
- WE ALMOST DID IT, THOUGH, 
DIDN'T WE?

527
00:20:04,118 --> 00:20:07,038
WE ALMOST PULLED IT OFF.

528
00:20:07,038 --> 00:20:09,123
- NO, IT WASN'T EVEN CLOSE.

529
00:20:09,123 --> 00:20:10,834
- YEAH, A LOT OF PEOPLE 
GOT HURT.

530
00:20:10,834 --> 00:20:13,462
- THIS WAS VERY, VERY BAD. 
- NOT GREAT. NOT GREAT.

531
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:15,547
narrator: ON THE NEXT 
"ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT."

532
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:18,925
LINDSAY FINDS OUT THE TRUE 
IDENTITY OF HER HOMELESS MAN.

533
00:20:18,925 --> 00:20:23,222
- LOOK. YOU'RE A REALLY NICE 
CHICK, BUT I'M NOT HOMELESS.

534
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:25,390
I'M TOM JANE.

535
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:27,226
narrator: AND EVEN THOUGH 
LINDSAY DOESN'T KNOW

536
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:28,518
WHO THAT IS, HEARING 
THAT HE ISN'T HOMELESS

537
00:20:28,518 --> 00:20:29,853
IS GOOD ENOUGH FOR HER.

538
00:20:29,853 --> 00:20:34,358
- BUY ME A DRINK? 
- YOU'RE REALLY SWEET, BUT, NO.

539
00:20:34,358 --> 00:20:36,401
I'M TOM JANE.

540
00:20:36,401 --> 00:20:38,820
narrator: AND LINDSAY, 
CRUSHED AND ALONE,

541
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:41,906
FOR THE FIRST TIME 
MISSES HER HUSBAND.

542
00:20:41,906 --> 00:20:43,157
- TOBIAS.

543
00:20:43,157 --> 00:20:46,995
- [singing] 
WHEN I'M DOWN, SO DOWN

544
00:20:46,995 --> 00:20:48,247
STARING AT THE GROUND

545
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:50,999
- LINDSAY, I'M--

546
00:20:50,999 --> 00:20:52,751
- IS THAT GEORGE MICHAEL'S 
DIAMOND CREAM?

547
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:54,002
- OH, YES, WELL, 
I RAN OUT OF BLUE,

548
00:20:54,002 --> 00:20:56,296
AND I COULDN'T 
FIND ANYTHING ELSE.

549
00:20:56,296 --> 00:20:57,881
I THINK MY NIPPLES 
ARE BLEEDING, THOUGH.

550
00:20:57,881 --> 00:21:00,008
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'RE SUPPOSED 
TO USE QUITE THIS MUCH, BUT I--

551
00:21:00,008 --> 00:21:02,010
- [singing] EVERY DAY

552
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:04,804
- THAT GUY'S A JERK. 
- NO, I AM.

553
00:21:04,804 --> 00:21:08,267
- NO, NO, I AM.

554
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:10,727
BECAUSE I THINK I NEED TO GO TO 
THE HOSPITAL RIGHT AWAY

555
00:21:10,727 --> 00:21:12,521
AND SEE IF I CAN'T GET 
SOME OF THIS DIAMOND DUST

556
00:21:12,521 --> 00:21:15,148
VACUUMED FROM OUT OF MY LUNGS.

557
00:21:15,148 --> 00:21:16,775
THIS WAY.
