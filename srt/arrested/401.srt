<i>It was May 4,</i>

00:00:15,333 --> 00:00:17,959
<i>and in the bayside town</i>
<i>of Newport Beach,</i>

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,500
<i>the annual celebration</i>

6
00:00:19,542 --> 00:00:22,417
<i>known as Cinco de Cuatro</i>

7
00:00:22,458 --> 00:00:26,208
<i>The holiday started as</i>
<i>a particularly vicious response</i>

8
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:29,417
<i>by a young Lucille Bluth</i>
<i>to the Mexican holiday...</i>

9
00:00:29,458 --> 00:00:31,583
-This still isn't made?
<i>-...of Cinco de Mayo.</i>

10
00:00:31,625 --> 00:00:34,834
-No, no, it's not.
-Rosa, why is this
still a mess?!

11
00:00:34,875 --> 00:00:37,208
She said it's, uh,
it's Cinco de Mayo.

12
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:39,250
She's taking, uh, the day off.

13
00:00:39,291 --> 00:00:40,709
-She said that?
-Yeah.

14
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:42,333
-She called it Cinco de Mayo?
-She did, yeah.

15
00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:44,959
Oh, why can't they
just call it May 5?

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,500
This is what
I was talking about.

17
00:00:46,542 --> 00:00:47,959
It's all part
of the Mexican war on May 5.

18
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,583
-War on May 5, I
know, yeah. It is.
-It is.

NARRATOR:

00:00:55,959 --> 00:00:58,000
Now it's not so funny, is it?

23
00:00:58,041 --> 00:01:00,000
No, not funny.

24
00:01:00,041 --> 00:01:02,000
We should start our own holiday.

NARRATOR:<i> You see, the Hispanics</i>

NARRATOR:<i> And then Lucille had</i>

29

30

56
00:02:23,625 --> 00:02:26,542
Michael, do you have
something for me?

57
00:02:26,583 --> 00:02:27,834
Does bad news count?

58
00:02:27,875 --> 00:02:29,333
There's that Bluth wit.

59
00:02:29,375 --> 00:02:31,208

I need that money I lent you.

00:02:51,166 --> 00:02:53,250
I am in the middle of a campaign

You're going to get it.

72
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:58,000

Why don't you go to your family?

I don't need them.

-No.

78
00:03:15,792 --> 00:03:19,083
Okay, that was nasty.

-Aren't you sweet?
-(chuckles)

80
00:03:20,625 --> 00:03:22,041
-Thank you.
-Okay.

NARRATOR:
<i>Later that night,</i>

86
00:03:38,333 --> 00:03:41,291
<i>after Michael did</i>
<i>something unthinkable,</i>

87
00:03:41,333 --> 00:03:43,917
<i>he was looking</i>
<i>for a place to hide</i>

88
00:03:43,959 --> 00:03:46,875
<i>and he returned</i>
<i>to a long neglected model home</i>

89
00:03:46,917 --> 00:03:48,625
<i>he believed to be empty.</i>

90
00:03:50,375 --> 00:03:52,333
GOB:
Thanks for coming

91
00:03:52,375 --> 00:03:54,500
so late, Maria, I know
that you won't be cleaning up

92
00:03:54,542 --> 00:03:56,750
tomorrow, and we did make
quite a mess of that bedroom.

93
00:03:56,792 --> 00:03:58,583
Michael.

94
00:03:58,625 --> 00:04:00,750
NARRATOR:
<i>This is Michael's brother Gob.</i>

95
00:04:00,792 --> 00:04:02,583
<i>Neither had expected</i>
<i>to see each other</i>

96

<i>after some recent</i>

97
00:04:04,792 --> 00:04:06,417
I didn't expect
to be seeing you again

98
00:04:06,458 --> 00:04:08,625
after all the unpleasantness.

99
00:04:08,667 --> 00:04:10,500
I-I've, I've,
I've been out of control.

100
00:04:10,542 --> 00:04:12,041
Sorry.

101
00:04:12,083 --> 00:04:13,542
In fact, I-I just did something
that I-I don't,

102
00:04:13,583 --> 00:04:15,542
I don't, I don't know
why I did it.

103
00:04:15,583 --> 00:04:16,792
Do you want to talk about it?

104
00:04:16,834 --> 00:04:19,000
No, I do not,
I've said too much already.

105
00:04:19,041 --> 00:04:20,208
You cannot help me.

106
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:21,208
Well, I wasn't hoping to help.

107
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:22,500
I was hoping to rub it in

108
00:04:22,542 --> 00:04:24,333
because of all
the unpleasantness.

109
00:04:24,375 --> 00:04:26,709
-Got it. 
-Oh, damn it, I meant
to throw these in the chipper.

110
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:29,417
God, I'm just not
into Cuatro this year.

111
00:04:29,458 --> 00:04:31,291
I was the one that was wrong,
not you,

112
00:04:31,333 --> 00:04:33,375
and besides, you could not
make me feel worse right now.

113
00:04:33,417 --> 00:04:34,583
Well, I'd be willing

114
00:04:34,625 --> 00:04:36,041
to let you have
your apology back

115
00:04:36,083 --> 00:04:37,542
if you give me
the chance to try.

116
00:04:37,583 --> 00:04:38,875
I mean, I'm gonna need
some specifics

117
00:04:38,917 --> 00:04:40,417
about the thing
that you're ashamed of.

118
00:04:40,458 --> 00:04:42,667
Otherwise I'll just be
taking general potshots.

119
00:04:44,875 --> 00:04:48,583
Bad example: if you were ashamed
of being in love with a man,

120
00:04:48,625 --> 00:04:50,875
suddenly discovered
these new feelings,

121
00:04:50,917 --> 00:04:53,500
then I might say something like,
"Homo much?"

122
00:04:53,542 --> 00:04:54,750
-It's not that.
-I said "Bad example."

123
00:04:54,792 --> 00:04:56,250
I went to go see Lucille 2

124
00:04:56,291 --> 00:04:59,583
and I just, I just--
I lost control.

125
00:04:59,625 --> 00:05:01,542
I did something
that I wish I could forget.

126
00:05:01,583 --> 00:05:03,417
You have got no idea how I feel.

127
00:05:03,458 --> 00:05:05,083
Well, if you're talking about
doing something embarrassing

128
00:05:05,125 --> 00:05:06,583
with a woman, then no, I don't.

129
00:05:06,625 --> 00:05:08,208
NARRATOR:
<i>But he should have.</i>

130
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:10,083
<i>It's almost</i>
<i>as if he found a way</i>

131
00:05:10,125 --> 00:05:13,375
<i>to simulate amnesia.</i>

132
00:05:13,417 --> 00:05:15,458

137
00:05:24,625 --> 00:05:26,417
<i>-No más.</i>
<i>-¿No más?</i>

138
00:05:26,458 --> 00:05:27,709
<i>...but was commonly known</i>
<i>as a roofie.</i>

139
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:28,709
GOB:
<i>There's only one left.</i>

140
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:30,333
How could that possibly be?

141
00:05:30,375 --> 00:05:31,917
Unless... John Beard Jr.

142
00:05:31,959 --> 00:05:33,625
I don't need to get into it.

143
00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:35,583
I came here because I thought
the house was empty,

144
00:05:35,625 --> 00:05:37,208
but I can go
somewhere else, okay?

145
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:39,375
-Hey, listen, Michael, if
you want, we can split this.
-No,

146
00:05:39,417 --> 00:05:41,291
I feel like this is something
that I shouldn't forget,

147
00:05:41,333 --> 00:05:43,125
okay, and believe me,
this is the last time

148
00:05:43,166 --> 00:05:45,291
I ever judge you for anything

149
00:05:45,333 --> 00:05:46,291
that you ever do.

150
00:05:46,333 --> 00:05:48,083

I knew it, I always knew it.

154
00:05:52,417 --> 00:05:53,917
-Take this, Michael,
forget, forget. 
-No, no, no, no, no.

155
00:05:53,959 --> 00:05:55,333
Put the mask back on.
Forget this, Michael.

156

-Forget, forget, Michael.
-Gob.

<i>to go to Phoenix,</i>

171
00:06:36,333 --> 00:06:40,458
<i>and even though the Phoenix</i>

172
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:43,250

173
00:06:43,291 --> 00:06:46,166
<i>by living in a dorm room</i>
<i>while doing so.</i>

174
00:06:46,208 --> 00:06:48,834
George Michael, what is
my log-on password again?

175
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:50,917
NARRATOR:<i> Unfortunately</i>
<i>it was his son's dorm room</i>

176
00:06:50,959 --> 00:06:52,667
<i>at the University of California</i>
<i>at Irvine.</i>

177
00:06:52,709 --> 00:06:57,250
Dad, come on, what have we said
is the most important thing?

178
00:06:57,291 --> 00:06:58,834
I have tried "family."

179
00:06:58,875 --> 00:07:00,333
-It does not work for me.
-No, privacy.

180
00:07:00,375 --> 00:07:02,709
NARRATOR:
<i>This is Michael's son</i>

181
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:05,333
<i>George Michael-- a nice kid.</i>

182
00:07:05,375 --> 00:07:07,917
Uh, no one should have
your password but you.

183
00:07:07,959 --> 00:07:09,333
I shouldn't even know it.

184
00:07:09,375 --> 00:07:11,250
-You've made that point.
-Have I?

185
00:07:11,291 --> 00:07:13,417
MICHAEL:<i> My point is, we have</i>
<i>no secrets from each other.</i>

186
00:07:13,458 --> 00:07:16,000
We know everything there is
to know about each other.

187
00:07:16,041 --> 00:07:17,000
We're like twins.

188
00:07:17,041 --> 00:07:19,000
I don't see us as twins.

189
00:07:19,041 --> 00:07:21,875
Yeah? You name me one way
in which we're different.

190
00:07:21,917 --> 00:07:23,750
GEORGE MICHAEL:
I think you tend to be better

191
00:07:23,792 --> 00:07:27,125
at feeling
like you belong places.

192
00:07:27,166 --> 00:07:29,166
MICHAEL:
Do I?

193
00:07:31,333 --> 00:07:34,542
I want you to start feeling
like you belong places.

194
00:07:34,583 --> 00:07:35,667
Look at that guy.

195
00:07:35,709 --> 00:07:37,959
He thinks he's a musician.

196
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,500
You know, like,
you've got to start having

197
00:07:39,542 --> 00:07:41,875
a little bit better sense
of humor about yourself.

198
00:07:41,917 --> 00:07:42,875
Look at me.

199
00:07:42,917 --> 00:07:44,125
People say I don't age.

200
00:07:44,166 --> 00:07:45,625
You know, like,
"Hey, look at that guy.

201
00:07:45,667 --> 00:07:47,333
He's got the hair
of a teenager."

202
00:07:47,375 --> 00:07:49,792
And I say, "Take your best shot"

203
00:07:49,834 --> 00:07:51,667
because I think
that that's a good thing

204
00:07:51,709 --> 00:07:53,291
because I'm self-effacing.

205
00:07:53,333 --> 00:07:54,625
Hmm?

206
00:07:54,667 --> 00:07:56,125
I want you to be able
to do that.

207
00:07:56,166 --> 00:07:57,917
Well, it's hard
to be self-effacing

208
00:07:57,959 --> 00:08:01,542
when you're a perfect specimen
of rugged manlessness.

209
00:08:01,583 --> 00:08:02,625
(chuckles)

210
00:08:03,959 --> 00:08:05,667
Well, you can't hear this, but,

211
00:08:05,709 --> 00:08:07,166
but we're gonna work on it.

212
00:08:07,208 --> 00:08:09,000
That's why I'm living
in your dorm.

213
00:08:09,041 --> 00:08:10,250
Well, I thought
you were living here

214
00:08:10,291 --> 00:08:12,041
because you had
nowhere else to go.

215
00:08:12,083 --> 00:08:14,375
Yeah, and because of the fact
you had this big double room

216
00:08:14,417 --> 00:08:15,667
all to yourself
because of your name.

217
00:08:15,709 --> 00:08:17,458
NARRATOR:
<i>The name George Michael</i>

218
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:20,166
<i>did create confusion</i>
<i>in the campus housing office.</i>

219
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:21,834
This guy's name is actually
George Michael.

220
00:08:21,875 --> 00:08:23,041
No, it's two different guys.

221
00:08:23,083 --> 00:08:25,750
-They're twins, ugly.
-(gasps)

222
00:08:25,792 --> 00:08:27,709
BOTH: We should sign them up
for Twin Club.

223
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:30,792
And let's give them
the big handicap room.

224
00:08:30,834 --> 00:08:32,375
Yeah, you see,
that's the other thing, is that

225
00:08:32,417 --> 00:08:34,542
I kind of wanted to use
this time to almost kind of,

226
00:08:34,583 --> 00:08:37,166
you know, wean off
of the name George Michael.

227
00:08:37,208 --> 00:08:39,917
What?

228
00:08:39,959 --> 00:08:42,625
I don't know, you know,
you get older, you do

229
00:08:42,667 --> 00:08:45,041
a something search
of your own name...

230
00:08:45,083 --> 00:08:46,917
NARRATOR:<i> In George Michael's</i>
<i>case, you find this.</i>

231
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:50,000
It was in this men's room in--
get this-- Beverly Hills

232
00:08:50,041 --> 00:08:52,250
that singer George Michael
was arrested

233
00:08:52,291 --> 00:08:55,417
for soliciting sex
from an undercover cop.

234
00:08:55,458 --> 00:08:58,417
Well, it was your mother's idea
to call you George Michael,

235
00:08:58,458 --> 00:08:59,709
you know, and I think
it was just

236
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:01,166
so that we didn't confuse you

237
00:09:01,208 --> 00:09:03,583
with your Uncle George or
your Grandfather George.

238
00:09:03,625 --> 00:09:06,166
-Right. 
-I got it, let's
call you Boy George.

239
00:09:06,208 --> 00:09:07,166
WOMAN:
<i>Singer Boy George</i>

240
00:09:07,208 --> 00:09:08,166
in the news again today,

241
00:09:08,208 --> 00:09:09,250
this time for sexual assault

242
00:09:09,291 --> 00:09:11,250
in a men's public bathroom.

243
00:09:11,291 --> 00:09:12,583
Beatrix Hebberly-Sneed,
Wee BBC 2.

244
00:09:12,625 --> 00:09:14,375
GEORGE MICHAEL:
<i>You know, I think</i>

245
00:09:14,417 --> 00:09:16,542
I'll, I'll just--
I'll stick with George Michael.

246
00:09:16,583 --> 00:09:18,375
I mean, at least
it was consensual.

247
00:09:18,417 --> 00:09:20,542
But I guess the, uh,
the bigger point

248
00:09:20,583 --> 00:09:22,834
I'm making is just that,
uh, it's hard to have

249
00:09:22,875 --> 00:09:24,583
any privacy
now that they've stuck me

250
00:09:24,625 --> 00:09:26,917
-with an actual roommate.
-Well, you know, listen,

251
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:29,208
I'm all for kicking P-Hound out,
you know that.

252
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:31,417
Well, you know, I didn't
really mean privacy from him.

253
00:09:31,458 --> 00:09:33,458
I know, I know, I know.

254
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:38,208
You want your space from me?

255
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:39,834
Um, look,

256
00:09:39,875 --> 00:09:43,583
listen, hey, hey,
look, look, listen.

257
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:45,750
Listen, look it.

258
00:09:45,792 --> 00:09:48,542
Are you listening?
You want your space.

259
00:09:48,583 --> 00:09:49,875
I get it.

260
00:09:49,917 --> 00:09:53,208
I did not mean
to crowd you, pal.

261
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:56,250
Listen, I thought that this was,
that this was fun, and,

262
00:09:56,291 --> 00:09:58,417
-and it is okay if you
didn't see it that way.
-Oh, Dad.

263
00:09:58,458 --> 00:10:00,458
Buddy, it's not like
I don't have someplace to go.

264
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:02,667
You know, I'll just go
right back to the model home.

265
00:10:02,709 --> 00:10:04,417
They don't have Internet there,
so I'll just put

266
00:10:04,458 --> 00:10:06,250
the law school on, on, on pause.

267
00:10:06,291 --> 00:10:08,041
It's not like the first time
that I've done that.

268
00:10:08,083 --> 00:10:10,083
You know, last time I did that,
you were born. You know what?

269
00:10:10,125 --> 00:10:11,625
Screw it, maybe I'll just go
to the real Phoenix

270
00:10:11,667 --> 00:10:13,166
and finish school.

271
00:10:13,208 --> 00:10:14,542
They got one in Costa Mesa.

272
00:10:14,583 --> 00:10:16,291
Plus they want me
for an article.

273
00:10:16,333 --> 00:10:17,750
Media wants to talk
to Daddy about the real

274
00:10:17,792 --> 00:10:19,250
estate business,
and once they do that,

275
00:10:19,291 --> 00:10:21,125
-I'm gonna be right back on top.
-(groans)

276
00:10:21,166 --> 00:10:22,500
You know what?
This is your school rally shirt.

277
00:10:22,542 --> 00:10:24,333
You know, same size-- medium.

278
00:10:24,375 --> 00:10:26,291
Do you know where mine is? We
wear the same size like twi...

279
00:10:26,333 --> 00:10:28,750
We're just like twin--
couple of identical...

280
00:10:28,792 --> 00:10:30,375
Dad, Dad, no, I...

281
00:10:30,417 --> 00:10:34,000
Look, I was not talking
about privacy from you per se.

282
00:10:34,041 --> 00:10:38,375
I was talking about my software.

283
00:10:38,417 --> 00:10:39,917
What's that?

284
00:10:39,959 --> 00:10:42,458
It's privacy software.

285
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:44,000
That's why the word came up.

286
00:10:44,041 --> 00:10:45,667
<i>It's not why the word came up.</i>

287
00:10:45,709 --> 00:10:47,625
<i>But George Michael</i>
<i>was writing code</i>

288
00:10:47,667 --> 00:10:49,375
<i>for a block software</i>

289
00:10:49,417 --> 00:10:52,041
<i>with his roommate</i>
<i>that was proving challenging.</i>

290
00:10:52,083 --> 00:10:53,333
...you're leaving a hole

291
00:10:53,375 --> 00:10:55,083
just right in the middle
of the block.

292
00:10:55,125 --> 00:10:57,208
<i>Both because of online threats</i>
<i>to his privacy...</i>

293
00:10:57,250 --> 00:10:59,166
Otherwise, people will be
able to hack in through

294
00:10:59,208 --> 00:11:01,333
a mobile platform portal, and
it won't be a block anything 3G.

295
00:11:01,375 --> 00:11:03,667
<i>...and some in-room threats</i>
<i>to his privacy, as well.</i>

296
00:11:03,709 --> 00:11:05,625
Buddy, is that schoolwork?

297
00:11:05,667 --> 00:11:07,041
No, we're just right
in the middle of this software.

298
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:08,792
Great, good.
Give me the lappy.

299
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:10,542
I'll hit save for you.
I got to Skype with my advisor

300
00:11:10,583 --> 00:11:12,375
in Phoenix, and if I don't
get on right now,

301
00:11:12,417 --> 00:11:16,834
he's gonna have to Skype me
from a T.G.I. Friday's.

302
00:11:16,875 --> 00:11:18,792
-Oh.
-Yeah.

303
00:11:18,834 --> 00:11:20,250
Whew.

304
00:11:20,291 --> 00:11:21,625
'Cause that hurt for a second.

305
00:11:21,667 --> 00:11:23,250
I was like, he wants me to go.

306
00:11:23,291 --> 00:11:25,291
-No, no, no, no, no.
-But no. Yeah? No.

307
00:11:25,333 --> 00:11:26,458
-Software.
-No.

308
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:27,750
I mean, yeah, I may need

309
00:11:27,792 --> 00:11:29,917
some privacy, you know,
to work on it,

310
00:11:29,959 --> 00:11:34,417
and that might mean...
you going.

311
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:39,000
Oh, you mean here.

312
00:11:39,041 --> 00:11:40,583
Yeah, clearing out.

313
00:11:40,625 --> 00:11:42,208
An hour, here, there. Yes?

314
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:43,625
Got it. Not a problem.
You give me a little

315
00:11:43,667 --> 00:11:45,667
fair warning,
I clear right out of here.

316
00:11:45,709 --> 00:11:47,417
Let's schedule it now.
We can do it.

317
00:11:47,458 --> 00:11:49,041
I need help with
the calendar though.

318
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:51,542
It's, like, stuck on 2003.

319
00:11:51,583 --> 00:11:53,500
-Help me just break into...
-You just hit "today."

320
00:11:53,542 --> 00:11:55,166
-The "today" button.
-Sorry. It's stuck in 2003,

321
00:11:55,208 --> 00:11:56,375
so I don't have "today."

322
00:11:56,417 --> 00:11:57,458
I need to jump forward...

323
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:59,000
No, I know, there's a button

324
00:11:59,041 --> 00:12:00,667
-that says "today."
-Yeah, this has no button.

325
00:12:00,709 --> 00:12:01,834
Anyway, you know,
I'm just gonna run downstairs

326
00:12:01,875 --> 00:12:02,834
and, uh, grab a bite.

327
00:12:02,875 --> 00:12:05,041
Wait, I want to go.

328
00:12:05,083 --> 00:12:06,417
(chuckles)

329
00:12:06,458 --> 00:12:07,834
Let me go. I'll go. I'm hungry.

330
00:12:07,875 --> 00:12:09,834
Come on.

Is it like Facebook?

338
00:12:23,625 --> 00:12:25,250
Uh, well, no.

339
00:12:25,291 --> 00:12:26,792
It's kind of the opposite
of Facebook, you know.

340
00:12:26,834 --> 00:12:28,792
Facebook connects you
with everyone,

341
00:12:28,834 --> 00:12:31,000
this blocks you from everyone.

342
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:33,458
Oh, okay. Kind of like
the antisocial network, right?

343
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:35,041
-That's very good.
-You can use it.

344
00:12:35,083 --> 00:12:36,709
I don't understand
the Internet stuff.

345
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:39,000
You give me all the parts
and you tell me to build

346
00:12:39,041 --> 00:12:41,291
a television set, I can
bang that out, but I, you know,

347
00:12:41,333 --> 00:12:43,375
I can't get the right day
to display on my calendar.

348
00:12:43,417 --> 00:12:45,333
-Just press "today."
-Yeah, just tried that.

349
00:12:45,375 --> 00:12:47,083
Doesn't work on mine, pal.

350
00:12:47,125 --> 00:12:49,000
This is very, very, very
exciting, you know,

351
00:12:49,041 --> 00:12:52,083
because once they come out
with that article on me

352
00:12:52,125 --> 00:12:54,000
in that in-flight magazine,

353
00:12:54,041 --> 00:12:56,250
now, the family's gonna be
right back on top.

354
00:12:56,291 --> 00:12:58,500
-The guy's doing a
whole spread on me.
-In-flight magazine?

355
00:12:58,542 --> 00:13:00,041
Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah.
It's called<i> Altitude.</i>

356
00:13:00,083 --> 00:13:01,291
It's for OutWest Airlines.

357
00:13:01,333 --> 00:13:02,542
Next to<i> SkyMall,</i> it's, like,

358
00:13:02,583 --> 00:13:04,083
the number two most read
in all of coach.

359
00:13:04,125 --> 00:13:05,667
Well, three with
the safety card,

360
00:13:05,709 --> 00:13:08,291
but get a lot of attention
for Sudden Valley.

361
00:13:08,333 --> 00:13:10,333
And then with your Internet
company, it's gonna be like--

362
00:13:10,375 --> 00:13:12,333
we're gonna have two businesses,
you know?

363
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:13,959
And yours sounds like
such a natural.

364
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,125
I mean, no one likes
to share their identity.

365
00:13:16,166 --> 00:13:17,417
-Right?
-Well...

366
00:13:17,458 --> 00:13:18,542
Okay, give me
your meal plan card.

367
00:13:18,583 --> 00:13:20,083
I'm gonna run in there,

368
00:13:20,125 --> 00:13:21,417
I'm gonna grab a tray,
you run around back,

369
00:13:21,458 --> 00:13:22,458
make sure you get there in time,

370
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:23,583
before my hand stamp dries.

371
00:13:23,625 --> 00:13:24,583
Okay?

372
00:13:24,625 --> 00:13:26,542
Here we go.

373
00:13:26,583 --> 00:13:28,583
<i>Michael had a right</i>
<i>to be excited.</i>

374
00:13:28,625 --> 00:13:30,875
<i>It had been many years</i>
<i>since the Bluth family</i>

375
00:13:30,917 --> 00:13:32,792
<i>had had any business success.</i>

376
00:13:32,834 --> 00:13:37,125
<i>Not since Michael's mother</i>
<i>Lucille had sold off a quarter</i>

377
00:13:37,166 --> 00:13:40,375
<i>of the company just before the</i>
<i>onset of the great dark period.</i>

378
00:13:40,417 --> 00:13:42,667
<i>But after examining</i>
<i>the company's prospects...</i>

379
00:13:42,709 --> 00:13:45,500
Are those police boats?

380
00:13:45,542 --> 00:13:47,208
Lucille 2.

381
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:48,792
<i>...Stan Sitwell</i>
<i>quickly divested himself.</i>

382
00:13:48,834 --> 00:13:51,583
How'd you like to be bumped up
to Lucille 1?

383
00:13:51,625 --> 00:13:53,500
<i>So the Bluth family</i>
<i>had a new stakeholder,</i>

384
00:13:53,542 --> 00:13:56,291
<i>while the old one,</i>
<i>who knew she'd be implicated</i>

385
00:13:56,333 --> 00:13:58,041
<i>in some of</i>
<i>the family's misdeeds...</i>

386
00:13:58,083 --> 00:14:00,041
You boys know
how to shovel coal?

387
00:14:00,083 --> 00:14:02,917
<i>...headed out on whatever the</i>
<i>opposite of a maiden voyage is.</i>

388
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:04,000
(ship horn blows)

389
00:14:04,041 --> 00:14:06,458
<i>Michael, however, made a pledge</i>

390
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:09,125
<i>not to get pulled</i>
<i>into the drama</i>

391
00:14:09,166 --> 00:14:12,250
<i>and to let the family</i>
<i>keep themselves all together,</i>

392
00:14:12,291 --> 00:14:13,959
<i>-for a while. </i>
-...for a while.

393
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,959
<i>And he set off to sea, even as</i>

394
00:14:16,041 --> 00:14:18,417
<i>his mother mysteriously</i>
<i>turned back.</i>

395
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:21,250
Why the alleged ship-jacker
changed direction

396
00:14:21,291 --> 00:14:22,792
is still unexplained.

397
00:14:22,834 --> 00:14:25,291
But what is known
is that many of the charges

398
00:14:25,333 --> 00:14:27,792
against this seaward matriarch
will fall under

399
00:14:27,834 --> 00:14:31,583
the dominion of the little
understood maritime law.

400
00:14:31,625 --> 00:14:33,792
<i>And soon,</i>
<i>the hearing drew near...</i>

401
00:14:33,834 --> 00:14:35,375
Well, I missed the hearing.

402
00:14:35,417 --> 00:14:37,000
<i>...and then passed.</i>

403
00:14:37,041 --> 00:14:38,875
Oh, it just snuck up on me,
and then they called,

404
00:14:38,917 --> 00:14:40,750
and they wanted me there
at eight bells.

405
00:14:40,792 --> 00:14:43,166
You know, I thought
that was their 5:00 p.m.

406
00:14:43,208 --> 00:14:45,291
By the time I got back,
the courtroom was

407
00:14:45,333 --> 00:14:47,250
reverted back
to the crab restaurant.

408
00:14:47,291 --> 00:14:48,834
"Eight bells" refers
to a watch length.

409
00:14:48,875 --> 00:14:50,250
It's maritime law.

410
00:14:50,291 --> 00:14:52,375
<i>Yes, Michael returned</i>
<i>after all.</i>

411
00:14:52,417 --> 00:14:54,291
You know, one bell is struck
after 30 minutes, two bells...

412
00:14:54,333 --> 00:14:55,709
<i>It seems Michael</i>
<i>had been interested</i>

413
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:58,417
<i>in maritime law</i>
<i>since playing a lawyer</i>

414
00:14:58,458 --> 00:15:00,375
<i>in an original school play</i>

415
00:15:00,417 --> 00:15:02,917
<i>titled</i> The Trial
of Captain Hook.

416
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:04,625
♪ You're a crook,
Captain Hook... ♪

417
00:15:04,667 --> 00:15:06,417
<i>Prior to this,</i>
<i>his only dream had been</i>

418
00:15:06,458 --> 00:15:07,792
<i>to possess the power of flight.</i>

419
00:15:07,834 --> 00:15:10,375
<i>But that one turned out to be</i>

420
00:15:10,417 --> 00:15:11,792
<i>not as much fun as he thought.</i>

421
00:15:11,834 --> 00:15:14,083
Watch out for the seal!

422
00:15:14,125 --> 00:15:15,125
(crowd gasps)

423
00:15:15,166 --> 00:15:16,917
Loose seal! Loose seal!

424
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:18,834
I'm watching!

425
00:15:18,875 --> 00:15:20,333
(crowd gasps)

426
00:15:21,542 --> 00:15:23,375
You're out of the play!

427
00:15:23,417 --> 00:15:25,291
That's why, at sea, a watch with
no incidents is described as

428
00:15:25,333 --> 00:15:26,709
"eight bells and all is well."

429
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:29,083
Wow, maybe you should be
the maritime lawyer.

430
00:15:29,125 --> 00:15:30,208
This is what I've been saying.

431
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:31,625
Because I did go to law school

432
00:15:31,667 --> 00:15:32,917
with an emphasis
on maritime law.

433
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:34,917
Oh, your one year of law school

434
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:36,792
is going to beat Barry's three?

435
00:15:36,834 --> 00:15:38,542
It's ridiculous.

436
00:15:38,583 --> 00:15:39,667
We'll hire the best.

437
00:15:39,709 --> 00:15:40,667
And who's gonna pay

438
00:15:40,709 --> 00:15:42,041
for the best, Mom?

439
00:15:42,083 --> 00:15:43,375
We have money from
selling some shares.

440
00:15:43,417 --> 00:15:45,333
Plus, we got
that stimulus package.

441
00:15:45,375 --> 00:15:46,625
What are you talking about?

442
00:15:46,667 --> 00:15:48,208
That money is spent.

443
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:51,375
I just bought 4,000 acres
of California desert.

444
00:15:51,417 --> 00:15:52,375
Time-out.

445
00:15:52,417 --> 00:15:53,792
Hang on.

446
00:15:53,834 --> 00:15:55,625
-What's this?
-Yeah. (clears throat)

447
00:15:55,667 --> 00:15:58,667
I'm gonna be moving there
for a little while.

448
00:15:58,709 --> 00:16:01,458
Old big bear's not gonna be
around much anymore.

449
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:03,417
-I don't care about that.
-He's in denial.

450
00:16:03,458 --> 00:16:04,792
-We're getting divorced!
-Your mother and I

451
00:16:04,834 --> 00:16:05,792
are getting a divorce.

452
00:16:05,834 --> 00:16:07,250
(screams, gasps)

453
00:16:10,041 --> 00:16:11,208
I want to know...

454
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:14,250
(whimpering)

455
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,875
I want to know about
the stimulus package.

456
00:16:18,917 --> 00:16:21,792
You couldn't use any of that
money to finish Sudden Valley?

457
00:16:21,834 --> 00:16:23,625
You don't consider
that finished?

458
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:26,542
So the family got
a little stimmy.

459
00:16:26,583 --> 00:16:28,375
Don't make a federal case
out of it.

460
00:16:28,417 --> 00:16:30,834
That is exactly what they're
going to make out of it.

461
00:16:30,875 --> 00:16:32,542
And when you say "family,"
you mean our family?

462
00:16:32,583 --> 00:16:33,792
They've already got
their hooks in it?

463
00:16:33,834 --> 00:16:35,208
Buster, no offense.

464
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:36,208
None taken.

465
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:37,750
Oh, I keep losing my jewels.

466
00:16:37,792 --> 00:16:40,041
Michael, you never
accept help from anyone.

467
00:16:40,083 --> 00:16:42,125
That's why we didn't cut you in.

468
00:16:42,166 --> 00:16:43,667
We didn't want to demean you.

469
00:16:43,709 --> 00:16:45,917
It's like tipping
an African-American.

470
00:16:45,959 --> 00:16:48,417
You wouldn't tip
an African-American, would you?

471
00:16:48,458 --> 00:16:50,417
Of course I would.

472
00:16:50,458 --> 00:16:52,625
On a train?

473
00:16:52,667 --> 00:16:53,959
What...

474
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,917
Did you know about all this?

475
00:16:55,959 --> 00:16:58,291
No, I've been tipping them.

476
00:16:58,333 --> 00:16:59,709
Even a waiter?

477
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:01,709
Okay, the treadmill's
up and running.

478
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:03,834
We got the door on,
and we were able

479
00:17:03,875 --> 00:17:06,041
to match the faux on the paint.

480
00:17:10,208 --> 00:17:12,750
Thank you so much
for your hard work.

481
00:17:16,709 --> 00:17:18,959
So long.

482
00:17:20,417 --> 00:17:22,959
Michael, we can't
give you that money.

483
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,583
We got to keep you clean.

484
00:17:24,625 --> 00:17:26,250
You're the key witness
in your mother's trial.

485
00:17:26,291 --> 00:17:27,417
Let me get this straight.

486
00:17:27,458 --> 00:17:29,250
I still have to do all the work

487
00:17:29,291 --> 00:17:32,041
as the president of the company,
but I can't use any of the money

488
00:17:32,083 --> 00:17:34,375
for the company, and you won't
let me help with your case,

489
00:17:34,417 --> 00:17:36,542
but you'd still like for me
to testify at your trial.

490
00:17:36,583 --> 00:17:38,041
Is that right?

491
00:17:38,083 --> 00:17:40,709
I just want you to say
I was a loving mother.

492
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:41,917
And now perjury.

493
00:17:41,959 --> 00:17:43,333
Hey, it wasn't easy to get

494
00:17:43,375 --> 00:17:45,750
Lucille 2 to keep you on
as president.

495
00:17:45,792 --> 00:17:48,250
-I'll be sure to thank her.
-Don't thank her.

496
00:17:48,291 --> 00:17:50,458
She doesn't have
enough shares to stop us.

497
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:52,375
Hmm.

498
00:17:52,417 --> 00:17:54,458
<i>And that's how Michael</i>
<i>found a way</i>

499
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:55,458
<i>to finish</i>
<i>Sudden Valley himself.</i>

500
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:57,875
-Hello.
-Hello.

501
00:17:57,917 --> 00:18:02,125
<i>He simply traded his shares of</i>
<i>the Bluth company to Lucille 2.</i>

502
00:18:02,166 --> 00:18:03,792
I hold on to Sudden Valley;
it's like a pet project...

503
00:18:03,834 --> 00:18:05,291
<i>-Getting himself out, </i>
-Thank you so much.

504
00:18:05,333 --> 00:18:07,333
<i>and giving the balance of power</i>

505
00:18:07,375 --> 00:18:10,500
<i>to a woman who had</i>
<i>no power of balance.</i>

506
00:18:10,542 --> 00:18:11,834
-(gasps)
-Oh.

507
00:18:11,875 --> 00:18:13,667
(grunts)

508
00:18:13,709 --> 00:18:16,875
<i>And for the first time,</i>
<i>he didn't feel he needed</i>

509
00:18:16,917 --> 00:18:20,417
<i>to tell his family</i>
<i>he was done with them.</i>

510
00:18:20,458 --> 00:18:21,875
<i>But he did anyway.</i>

511
00:18:21,917 --> 00:18:24,291
You know what,
I am done with this family.

512
00:18:24,333 --> 00:18:25,792
I hope you've saved some money,

513
00:18:25,834 --> 00:18:27,917
'cause you're gonna need
every dime now.

514
00:18:27,959 --> 00:18:29,208
What's this?

515
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:31,875
<i>And with his newfound wealth,</i>

516
00:18:31,917 --> 00:18:34,333
<i>Michael was not only able</i>
<i>to send his son off</i>

517
00:18:34,375 --> 00:18:36,542
-Get out of here!
<i>-to a bright future</i>

518
00:18:36,583 --> 00:18:39,041
<i>in college,</i>
<i>with the family car...</i>

519
00:18:40,917 --> 00:18:42,667
<i>...he was also able to finish</i>

520
00:18:42,709 --> 00:18:46,208
<i>the long-delayed housing</i>
<i>development Sudden Valley,</i>

521
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:51,291
<i>but this time,</i>
<i>under his own company name.</i>

522
00:18:51,333 --> 00:18:52,834
Maybe I can give you a tip.

523
00:18:52,875 --> 00:18:54,583
Might want to put a road
up to this place.

524
00:18:54,625 --> 00:18:56,166
Well, we paved the neighborhood.

525
00:18:56,208 --> 00:18:58,166
Just waiting for the city
to build a road to it.

526
00:18:58,208 --> 00:19:00,542
<i>And although his mother's</i>
<i>day in court was something</i>

527
00:19:00,583 --> 00:19:04,709
<i>both he and his college-bound</i>
<i>son would miss,</i>

528
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:07,166
<i>Michael truly felt</i>
<i>that nothing could go wrong.</i>

529
00:19:07,208 --> 00:19:09,625
<i>And then something did.</i>

530
00:19:09,667 --> 00:19:11,375
(rumbling)

531
00:19:11,417 --> 00:19:13,583
<i>Not that.</i>
<i>That happens all the time.</i>

532
00:19:13,625 --> 00:19:15,083
<i>This.</i>

533
00:19:15,125 --> 00:19:17,667
The collapse of the California
housing market

534
00:19:17,709 --> 00:19:20,959
is taking a personal toll with
cutbacks here at the station.

535
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,417
<i>And since the main Internet</i>
<i>and information cable</i>

536
00:19:23,458 --> 00:19:27,083
<i>had been severed when the</i>
<i>community pool was installed,</i>

537
00:19:27,125 --> 00:19:30,500
<i>Michael suddenly found himself</i>
<i>living in a ghost town</i>

538
00:19:30,542 --> 00:19:32,542
<i>he himself built.</i>

539
00:19:38,291 --> 00:19:40,792
Well, that's not a great sign.

540
00:19:40,834 --> 00:19:43,125
(vulture squawks)

541
00:19:43,166 --> 00:19:45,583
(plane passing overhead)

542
00:19:52,583 --> 00:19:55,000
This is why you don't
confide in a competitor.

543
00:19:55,041 --> 00:19:56,792
(vulture squawks)

544
00:19:58,875 --> 00:20:00,333
NARRATOR:
<i>Michael was desperate to cover</i>

545
00:20:00,375 --> 00:20:02,000
<i>his copious building costs...</i>

546
00:20:02,041 --> 00:20:03,291
Just till I get on my feet.

547
00:20:03,333 --> 00:20:04,917
<i>...so he returned to a woman</i>

548
00:20:04,959 --> 00:20:07,333
<i>he could count on</i>
<i>to put off his downfall.</i>

549
00:20:07,375 --> 00:20:09,125
-I got you!
<i>-Just as he could count on</i>

550
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:11,166
<i>her putting him off</i>
<i>and falling down.</i>

551
00:20:11,208 --> 00:20:12,667
You did. Bye-bye.

552
00:20:12,709 --> 00:20:13,875
Oop.

553
00:20:13,917 --> 00:20:16,208
That's a hot mess.

554
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:17,875
<i>But weeks</i>
<i>stretched into months,</i>

555
00:20:17,917 --> 00:20:19,500
<i>and the situation got bleaker.</i>

556
00:20:19,542 --> 00:20:22,417
(wind whistling)

557
00:20:22,458 --> 00:20:25,333
<i>And it was either this</i>
<i>that made him lose hope...</i>

558
00:20:28,208 --> 00:20:29,583
(weakly):
Love each other.

559
00:20:29,625 --> 00:20:31,375
Pete! Pete!

560
00:20:31,417 --> 00:20:34,250
<i>...or possibly it was</i>
<i>the death of that mailman...</i>

561
00:20:34,291 --> 00:20:35,291
Wait here.

562
00:20:35,333 --> 00:20:36,667
Hang on, Pete!

563
00:20:36,709 --> 00:20:37,667
<i>...but Michael finally gave up.</i>

564
00:20:37,709 --> 00:20:38,917
I got one bar!

565
00:20:38,959 --> 00:20:40,750
<i>And having alienated</i>

566
00:20:40,792 --> 00:20:42,250
<i>everyone else in the family,</i>

567
00:20:42,291 --> 00:20:44,500
<i>turned to the one person</i>
<i>he had left.</i>

568
00:20:44,542 --> 00:20:48,083
I thought we'd have Thanksgiving
here for your senior year.

569
00:20:48,125 --> 00:20:50,709
I don't have a kitchen.

570
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:52,792
Oh, these are my clothes.

571
00:20:53,959 --> 00:20:56,333
Pete died.

572
00:20:56,375 --> 00:20:58,291
God.

573
00:20:58,333 --> 00:21:02,333
<i>And so Michael moved into</i>
<i>his son's college dorm room.</i>

574
00:21:04,375 --> 00:21:05,709
You are kidding me.

575
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:07,125
They're gonna be
in seat backs today?

576
00:21:07,166 --> 00:21:08,166
That is great news.

577
00:21:08,208 --> 00:21:10,000
<i>Which, in the new economy,</i>

578
00:21:10,041 --> 00:21:12,083
<i>wasn't as unusual a phenomenon</i>
<i>as you might think.</i>

579
00:21:12,125 --> 00:21:14,000
Don't go through my stuff,
Granddad.

580
00:21:14,041 --> 00:21:16,583
Hey, who do you think
paid for your stuff?

581
00:21:16,625 --> 00:21:18,583
Excuse me. Sorry. Do you know
where George Michael is?

582
00:21:18,625 --> 00:21:20,083
Um, he's in the computer lab.

583
00:21:20,125 --> 00:21:21,750
Great.

584
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:23,750
-There's a computer lab?
-There's a computer lab?

585
00:21:23,792 --> 00:21:24,750
Huh.

586
00:21:24,792 --> 00:21:26,458
I'm putting up a wall.

587
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:28,917
We need to rework
our whole system here.

588
00:21:28,959 --> 00:21:30,834
Sounds like you guys are working
on your privacy software, huh?

589
00:21:30,875 --> 00:21:32,208
Hey. How'd you find me?

590
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:34,125
Uh, Trang's grandfather.

591
00:21:34,166 --> 00:21:37,166
Boy, shoot me if I'm 86, living
in my grandson's dorm, huh?

592
00:21:37,208 --> 00:21:39,208
Pal, good news.

593
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:41,041
The article that they did on me
in<i> Altitude</i> magazine

594
00:21:41,083 --> 00:21:42,041
comes out today.

595
00:21:42,083 --> 00:21:43,875
You're in<i> Attitude?</i>

596
00:21:43,917 --> 00:21:45,625
That magazine is gay.

597
00:21:45,667 --> 00:21:48,125
<i>Oh, he wasn't being flip</i>
<i>with the word "gay."</i>

598
00:21:48,166 --> 00:21:51,375
<i>Attitude is a British magazine</i>
<i>for homosexuals.</i>

599
00:21:51,417 --> 00:21:52,875
<i>Altitude.</i>

600
00:21:52,917 --> 00:21:54,625
It is OutWest Airlines'
in-flight magazine.

601
00:21:54,667 --> 00:21:55,667
Can I see it?

602
00:21:55,709 --> 00:21:57,375
Probably doesn't have it.

603
00:21:57,417 --> 00:21:59,500
Try finding a flight at this
time of the year. (laughs)

604
00:21:59,542 --> 00:22:02,166
You ever even been on a plane,
you piece of (bleep)?

605
00:22:03,709 --> 00:22:05,834
So can I see it?

606
00:22:05,875 --> 00:22:08,875
It-it is not in the terrestrial
newsstands just yet.

607
00:22:08,917 --> 00:22:10,750
Guess what though. You,
my friend, are in the article.

608
00:22:10,792 --> 00:22:12,625
-I'm in it?
-You're in it, you're in it.

609
00:22:12,667 --> 00:22:14,709
I mentioned you; I mentioned
that I'm living in your dorm.

610
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:17,000
I thought that it might help
with your popularity problem.

611
00:22:17,041 --> 00:22:19,458
Well, I'm gonna get going

612
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:21,333
-while the room is empty, so...
-Okay. Great.

613
00:22:21,375 --> 00:22:22,792
See you later.

614
00:22:22,834 --> 00:22:24,375
Boy, that's got to
drive you crazy, right?

615
00:22:24,417 --> 00:22:25,625
The whole reason you had to come

616
00:22:25,667 --> 00:22:27,375
to the computer lab
was for privacy.

617
00:22:27,417 --> 00:22:29,792
It's no wonder you can't
get a real girl up there.

618
00:22:29,834 --> 00:22:32,208
<i>Michael was referring</i>
<i>to something he'd walked in on</i>

619
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:33,750
<i>a few days earlier.</i>

620
00:22:33,792 --> 00:22:35,166
There's a girl in there.

621
00:22:35,208 --> 00:22:37,542
There is?

622
00:22:37,583 --> 00:22:39,625
Where the hell is
George Michael?

623
00:22:39,667 --> 00:22:41,333
-Excuse me. Hello. Oh.
-Dad.

624
00:22:41,375 --> 00:22:42,417
-Hi.
-Yeah.

625
00:22:42,458 --> 00:22:43,583
There's nobody in here.

626
00:22:43,625 --> 00:22:45,375
Buddy, bad news.

627
00:22:45,417 --> 00:22:47,208
P-Hound is yanking
our chain again.

628
00:22:47,250 --> 00:22:48,875
-Uncle Michael.
-Oh, my God.

629
00:22:48,917 --> 00:22:50,041
-Hi.
-Hello there.

630
00:22:50,083 --> 00:22:53,041
There is a kind of girl here.

631
00:22:53,083 --> 00:22:54,750
Didn't say it was your cousin.

632
00:22:54,792 --> 00:22:55,959
Well, he doesn't know.

633
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,333
Now, that's smart.

634
00:22:57,375 --> 00:23:00,000
Let him think
there's a girl in here.

635
00:23:00,041 --> 00:23:01,959
Actually, we've been talking
about how crowded that room is,

636
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,583
and P-Hound was suggesting that
maybe we, maybe we do a vote

637
00:23:05,625 --> 00:23:07,417
to see who stays
in the dorm room.

638
00:23:07,458 --> 00:23:09,166
He suggested that?
Are you serious?

639
00:23:09,208 --> 00:23:12,083
Well, the thing is that the room
is only sanctioned for two.

640
00:23:12,125 --> 00:23:13,333
Right, and we have a vote.

641
00:23:13,375 --> 00:23:14,667
He's gone in two seconds.

642
00:23:14,709 --> 00:23:16,333
Ah.

643
00:23:16,375 --> 00:23:17,792
Two against one, right?

644
00:23:17,834 --> 00:23:19,667
-Well, actually...
-We got to do it.

645
00:23:19,709 --> 00:23:22,208
The thing is that it kind of
puts me in an awkward position.

646
00:23:22,250 --> 00:23:23,834
-Hi.
-Hey.

647
00:23:23,875 --> 00:23:25,792
Because since there's only
three people voting,

648
00:23:25,834 --> 00:23:28,291
everyone's gonna know
who voted against who.

649
00:23:28,333 --> 00:23:30,166
Well, what about if your
"girlfriend" wants to move in.

650
00:23:30,208 --> 00:23:31,333
That way, she gets a vote.

651
00:23:31,375 --> 00:23:32,417
(laughs)

652
00:23:32,458 --> 00:23:33,917
I'm just here for tutoring.

653
00:23:33,959 --> 00:23:35,458
She's not my girlfriend,
she's my cousin.

654
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:36,542
I'm not attracted to him.

655
00:23:36,583 --> 00:23:38,125
Well, why's that even an issue?

656
00:23:38,166 --> 00:23:40,542
P-Hound doesn't know
any of that stuff. Okay?

657
00:23:40,583 --> 00:23:43,291
He'll just think that her vote's
the vote that got him out.

658
00:23:43,333 --> 00:23:46,125
Well, wouldn't my girlfriend
want to get rid of my father?

659
00:23:46,166 --> 00:23:47,667
-I'm not your girlfriend.
-Not your girlfriend.

660
00:23:47,709 --> 00:23:49,583
No, but he doesn't know that.

661
00:23:49,625 --> 00:23:51,166
No, well, someone's got to vote
for me, that's right.

662
00:23:51,208 --> 00:23:52,583
Otherwise, it's suspicious.

663
00:23:52,625 --> 00:23:54,291
We don't want
a palace coup, right?

664
00:23:54,333 --> 00:23:55,834
-Well, I'll vote you out.
-Yeah, I will.

665
00:23:55,875 --> 00:23:57,375
-Happy to do it.
-I wouldn't make you do that.

666
00:23:57,417 --> 00:23:58,875
You know, then I fall down
a flight of stairs,

667
00:23:58,917 --> 00:24:00,000
I crack my head open,
you feel bad

668
00:24:00,041 --> 00:24:01,083
about yourself your whole life.

669
00:24:01,125 --> 00:24:02,542
<i>And perhaps it was the chair</i>

670
00:24:02,583 --> 00:24:04,375
<i>that fooled Michael</i>
<i>into thinking</i>

671
00:24:04,417 --> 00:24:06,375
<i>his next idea was a good one.</i>

672
00:24:06,417 --> 00:24:09,250
What if I vote myself out?

673
00:24:09,291 --> 00:24:10,917
You'd do that?

674
00:24:10,959 --> 00:24:12,208
How would that help?

675
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:13,959
It's simple algebra.

676
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,542
You two vote against P-Hound,
nobody knows who did what,

677
00:24:16,583 --> 00:24:18,709
because there's a vote
against me in there,

678
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:20,792
and it's adios, brothiero.

679
00:24:20,834 --> 00:24:22,500
It cannot fail.

680
00:24:22,542 --> 00:24:24,792
<i>Michael was pleased</i>
<i>with his plan.</i>

681
00:24:24,834 --> 00:24:26,417
Won't that make it a tie?

682
00:24:26,458 --> 00:24:27,417
<i>Briefly.</i>

683
00:24:27,458 --> 00:24:28,875
Hmm?

684
00:24:28,917 --> 00:24:30,625
I mean, if the two of us
vote against P-Hound,

685
00:24:30,667 --> 00:24:32,583
and you and P-Hound
vote against you,

686
00:24:32,625 --> 00:24:34,500
then it's two against two,
right?

687
00:24:34,542 --> 00:24:37,250
Wow, you think, you think
that'd he'd vote against me?

688
00:24:37,291 --> 00:24:38,709
I mean...

689
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:40,500
Um...

690
00:24:40,542 --> 00:24:41,834
All right, new plan.

691
00:24:41,875 --> 00:24:43,667
<i>The details of the plan</i>

692
00:24:43,709 --> 00:24:45,458
<i>continued to develop</i>
<i>through lunch.</i>

693
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:46,834
MICHAEL:
So we got two scenarios.

694
00:24:46,875 --> 00:24:48,875
It's either two votes
against P-Hound,

695
00:24:48,917 --> 00:24:50,750
one vote against Maeby,
one against me,

696
00:24:50,792 --> 00:24:54,083
with that vote being my own;
or if it's two votes against me,

697
00:24:54,125 --> 00:24:55,792
then clearly
P-Hound is being nasty,

698
00:24:55,834 --> 00:24:57,875
that triggers a recount,
and then it's a P-Hound blitz.

699
00:24:57,917 --> 00:24:59,500
We all vote against P-Hound,
he's gone.

700
00:24:59,542 --> 00:25:00,792
Mm-hmm.

701
00:25:00,834 --> 00:25:02,417
What if whoever loses...

702
00:25:02,458 --> 00:25:03,709
Yeah?

703
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:05,667
...refuses to go?

704
00:25:05,709 --> 00:25:07,959
You think P-Hound would do that?

705
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,500
Okay, new plan.

706
00:25:09,542 --> 00:25:11,083
<i>And so the planning</i>
<i>continued through</i>

707
00:25:11,125 --> 00:25:13,375
<i>what should have been</i>
<i>organic chemistry.</i>

708
00:25:13,417 --> 00:25:15,542
MICHAEL:
We all pack ahead of time,

709
00:25:15,583 --> 00:25:18,291
really pack a bag, so it doesn't
look rigged, you know?

710
00:25:18,333 --> 00:25:19,834
And then the loser,
straight out the door.

711
00:25:19,875 --> 00:25:21,417
I mean, that's-that's the deal.

712
00:25:21,458 --> 00:25:23,125
You know, that's the cost
of having a vote,

713
00:25:23,166 --> 00:25:24,125
that's the price of freedom.

714
00:25:24,166 --> 00:25:25,709
You know, maybe it's...

715
00:25:25,750 --> 00:25:27,125
maybe it's better
if we're all just

716
00:25:27,166 --> 00:25:28,542
direct with each other,
you know?

717
00:25:28,583 --> 00:25:29,959
Just-just say
what's on our minds.

718
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,667
Yeah, I think it's gonna
come out anyway.

719
00:25:31,709 --> 00:25:36,000
Um, Dad, you know, I-I've really
loved living with you...

720
00:25:36,041 --> 00:25:37,041
No talking.

721
00:25:38,834 --> 00:25:40,875
No talking
once the votes come in.

722
00:25:40,917 --> 00:25:42,709
You're just right out the door.
That's the missing piece.

723
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:44,333
That's it.

724
00:25:44,375 --> 00:25:46,125
This plan is foolproof.

725
00:25:46,166 --> 00:25:48,834
Oh, I've cherished this,
too, pal.

726
00:25:48,875 --> 00:25:50,500
Yeah. I mean, how many,
how many fathers

727
00:25:50,542 --> 00:25:52,417
get to go to college
with their kid, huh?

728
00:25:52,458 --> 00:25:54,542
<i>So obviously</i>
<i>this is what happened.</i>

729
00:25:54,583 --> 00:25:57,333
<i>Michael read</i>
<i>his own vote first.</i>

730
00:25:57,375 --> 00:26:00,500
First vote to remove...

731
00:26:00,542 --> 00:26:01,709
Michael.

732
00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:03,250
Huh, what are you gonna do?

733
00:26:04,750 --> 00:26:07,834
Second vote to remove...

734
00:26:09,875 --> 00:26:11,667
...Michael.

735
00:26:11,709 --> 00:26:15,250
<i>Michael expected this,</i>
<i>but didn't expect the sting.</i>

736
00:26:15,291 --> 00:26:17,166
Wow.

737
00:26:17,208 --> 00:26:20,792
Obviously, if there's a tie,
there's an immediate runoff.

738
00:26:20,834 --> 00:26:23,375
Third vote to remove...

739
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:26,750
...Michael.

740
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:36,083
(quietly): Did you mean
to write "George Michael"?

741
00:26:36,125 --> 00:26:39,000
<i>Obviously, the verdict was in.</i>

742
00:26:39,041 --> 00:26:41,083
<i>And it's hard to know exactly</i>

743
00:26:41,125 --> 00:26:42,834
<i>why Michael opened</i>
<i>the fourth ballot.</i>

744
00:26:42,875 --> 00:26:46,834
<i>Was it out of hope</i>
<i>or confusion?</i>

745
00:26:46,875 --> 00:26:50,125
<i>Either way, it couldn't be</i>
<i>what he wanted to read.</i>

746
00:27:10,250 --> 00:27:13,709
<i>Michael did the only thing</i>
<i>he could think of</i>

747
00:27:13,750 --> 00:27:16,208
<i>that would save face.</i>

748
00:27:34,583 --> 00:27:36,417
(jet engine roars)

749
00:27:36,458 --> 00:27:39,583
NARRATOR:<i> Michael had just been</i>
<i>stunned by some bad news.</i>

750
00:27:39,625 --> 00:27:41,417
<i>And with nowhere to go,</i>
<i>he decided</i>

751
00:27:41,458 --> 00:27:44,166
<i>to pick up a copy of</i> Altitude
<i>to lift his spirits.</i>

752
00:27:44,208 --> 00:27:45,792
-Hi. Hello.
-Hey.

753
00:27:45,834 --> 00:27:47,250
Where you heading today, sir?

754
00:27:47,291 --> 00:27:48,834
Well, actually,
I just wanted a copy

755
00:27:48,875 --> 00:27:51,166
of your in-flight magazine
<i>Altitude.</i>

756
00:27:51,208 --> 00:27:53,166
Ah, this is ticketing.

757
00:27:53,208 --> 00:27:55,333
You can get the magazine
on the flight.

758
00:27:55,375 --> 00:27:58,041
I get it. But I'm actually--
I'm in the magazine.

759
00:27:58,083 --> 00:27:59,583
How many bags?

760
00:28:00,875 --> 00:28:02,000
Oh, I'm not checking these.

761
00:28:02,041 --> 00:28:03,083
Ah, sorry, you actually

762
00:28:03,125 --> 00:28:04,792
can't carry those on board.

763
00:28:04,834 --> 00:28:06,542
Let me start over.

764
00:28:06,583 --> 00:28:08,667
Uh, I-I am the star of
<i>Altitude</i> magazine this month--

765
00:28:08,709 --> 00:28:10,583
or quarter, actually.

766
00:28:10,625 --> 00:28:13,291
It's an April-September issue,
and I just wanted to get a copy.

767
00:28:13,333 --> 00:28:14,792
I'm not flying anywhere.

768
00:28:14,834 --> 00:28:16,041
Why do you have suitcases?

769
00:28:16,083 --> 00:28:17,417
Those are irrelevant.

770
00:28:17,458 --> 00:28:18,542
Not to me.

771
00:28:18,583 --> 00:28:20,458
Okay.

772
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:23,500
I was mistakenly voted out of
a four-person housing situation,

773
00:28:23,542 --> 00:28:26,208
uh, in a pack-first,
no-talking-after scenario.

774
00:28:26,250 --> 00:28:27,667
Does that clear it up for you?

775
00:28:27,709 --> 00:28:30,041
What do you mean
by "mistakenly"?

776
00:28:30,083 --> 00:28:32,250
I voted against myself to spare
my son the embarrassment

777
00:28:32,291 --> 00:28:35,208
of, of having to vote
his own father out of his dorm.

778
00:28:35,250 --> 00:28:36,458
That's all.

779
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:37,959
But that leaves
three other votes.

780
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,208
Yeah.

781
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:41,041
Can I get a copy
of the magazine, please?

782
00:28:41,083 --> 00:28:43,500
No, I'm sorry,
they're actually for passengers.

783
00:28:43,542 --> 00:28:45,166
We don't even give out
honey nuts, so we're not gonna

784
00:28:45,208 --> 00:28:47,375
-give you a magazine.
-Who wants honey nuts?

785
00:28:47,417 --> 00:28:48,625
I don't want the honey nuts.

786
00:28:48,667 --> 00:28:49,834
I want to just jump
onto the plane,

787
00:28:49,875 --> 00:28:51,083
-grab a magazine.
-Oh, okay,

788
00:28:51,125 --> 00:28:52,583
yeah, sure, we just, uh,
let people walk

789
00:28:52,625 --> 00:28:54,000
onto the plane all the time.

790
00:28:54,041 --> 00:28:56,750
-Do you want a box cutter also?
-(laughter)

791
00:28:56,792 --> 00:28:58,291
-Oh.
-Nice.

792
00:28:58,333 --> 00:29:00,208
These guys are jerks.

793
00:29:00,250 --> 00:29:01,500
Take that, take that.

794
00:29:01,542 --> 00:29:04,208
Enjoy.

795
00:29:04,250 --> 00:29:05,500
Tell you what--
give me a one-way ticket

796
00:29:05,542 --> 00:29:07,583
to your cheapest destination,
please.

797
00:29:07,625 --> 00:29:10,000
Oh, you lucked out.

798
00:29:10,041 --> 00:29:11,959
Today it's Pittsburgh.

799
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,375
He's good.

800
00:29:14,417 --> 00:29:16,125
What's the second cheapest?

801
00:29:16,166 --> 00:29:18,083
NARRATOR:<i> So Michael ended up</i>
<i>spending a little more</i>

802
00:29:18,125 --> 00:29:19,834
<i>to fly a little less,</i>

803
00:29:19,875 --> 00:29:22,291
<i>and after some confusion</i>
<i>at security...</i>

804
00:29:22,333 --> 00:29:23,625
But you've got nothing
in your luggage.

805
00:29:23,667 --> 00:29:24,709
I wasn't supposed to be
traveling today.

806
00:29:24,750 --> 00:29:26,208
I told you, it was

807
00:29:26,250 --> 00:29:27,333
a voting situation, there was a
miscalculation.

808
00:29:27,375 --> 00:29:28,667
Well, I mean, obviously

809
00:29:28,709 --> 00:29:30,208
P-Hound's gonna vote
against you.

810
00:29:30,250 --> 00:29:31,875
-I've never seen nothing...
-These three people with burkas

811
00:29:31,917 --> 00:29:33,750
just walked right by you.

812
00:29:33,792 --> 00:29:36,000
<i>...he found his seat.</i>

813
00:29:36,041 --> 00:29:39,083
<i>Unfortunately the seat</i>
<i>he was assigned didn't have</i>

814
00:29:39,125 --> 00:29:41,000
<i>a seat back pocket.</i>

815
00:29:41,041 --> 00:29:44,125
Hello, hi,
does each ticket entitle

816
00:29:44,166 --> 00:29:45,834
the passenger
to an in-flight magazine?

817
00:29:45,875 --> 00:29:47,458
No, it only guarantees you
a seat.

818
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:49,458
Perhaps I can ask
another passenger for one,

819
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:51,542
or if I'd rather, you can.

820
00:29:51,583 --> 00:29:54,375

<i>Michael steps out</i>
<i>of the air-conditioned airport.</i>

835
00:30:44,417 --> 00:30:47,375
Hope you know a good place

Ooh, dear Lord.
