NARRATOR:
<i>It was Tres de Cinco,</i>

2
00:00:11,553 --> 00:00:15,015
<i>or the day before</i>
<i>Cinco de Cuatro,</i>

3
00:00:15,056 --> 00:00:19,436
<i>and Buster Bluth had finally</i>
<i>found a family he fit in with.</i>

4
00:00:19,478 --> 00:00:21,563
Where's Mother? Ah.

5
00:00:21,605 --> 00:00:24,942
Ah, way to go, way to go.

6
00:00:26,067 --> 00:00:27,945
Hi. I know you've
been down today,

7
00:00:27,987 --> 00:00:29,822
so I brought you this.

8
00:00:29,864 --> 00:00:31,448
They're for Cinco.

9
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:32,908
In case you wanted
to make confetti

10
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:34,409

than the pictures

11

I am so blessed
to have you in my life.

13
00:00:38,914 --> 00:00:41,792
I'm so blessed to have you
in my life.

14
00:00:41,834 --> 00:00:45,629
Just six weeks ago,
I was a hot mess.

15
00:00:45,671 --> 00:00:47,214
I was desperate for a mother,

16
00:00:47,255 --> 00:00:48,966
and I don't think
I could admit it.

17
00:00:49,008 --> 00:00:51,719
NARRATOR:<i> As you'll see,</i>
<i>he admits it plenty.</i>

18
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,512
But now look at me.

19
00:00:53,554 --> 00:00:56,640
I'm with a beautiful,
elegant woman!

20
00:00:56,682 --> 00:00:58,475
(both laugh)

21
00:00:59,894 --> 00:01:03,480
And I think we should
take it to the next level.

22
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:09,361
<i>Buster had come a long way</i>
<i>since his fear of boats...</i>

23
00:01:09,403 --> 00:01:11,906
(Buster whimpering)

24
00:01:11,947 --> 00:01:13,824
<i>-...was conquered...</i> 
-(bleep) baby.

25
00:01:13,866 --> 00:01:16,952
<i>...and then rekindled,</i>
<i>only to find himself</i>

26
00:01:16,994 --> 00:01:18,996
<i>-facing a bigger fear.</i> 
-Oh, come on!

27
00:01:19,038 --> 00:01:21,832
<i>But his biggest fear</i>
<i>wasn't confronting</i>

28
00:01:21,874 --> 00:01:25,252
<i>a wet, loose seal;</i>
<i>it was losing one.</i>

29
00:01:25,293 --> 00:01:26,628
Wait! She doesn't have
her makeup!

30
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:28,213
I have her lipstick!

31
00:01:28,255 --> 00:01:30,257
Mother!

32
00:01:30,298 --> 00:01:31,926
-Michael.
-Yeah, it's a tough one

33
00:01:31,967 --> 00:01:34,344
because there's about
400 witnesses that are ready

34
00:01:34,386 --> 00:01:35,930
to throw her
underneath the boat.

35
00:01:35,971 --> 00:01:37,932
I don't think I can even help.

36
00:01:37,973 --> 00:01:39,266
(Buster whimpering)

37
00:01:39,307 --> 00:01:41,142
<i>Buster was distraught,</i>

38
00:01:41,184 --> 00:01:44,021
<i>-and made some foolish</i>

39
00:01:44,063 --> 00:01:45,397
-Oh, Buster.
<i>-Like this.</i>

40
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:46,690
Are you going to be all right?

41
00:01:46,732 --> 00:01:48,025
-Oh.
-Uh, you want me to stay?

42
00:01:48,067 --> 00:01:49,735
I was planning to visit
with my family.

43
00:01:49,777 --> 00:01:51,028
Oh, no, and just watch.

44
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:52,362
Mother is going to come

45
00:01:52,404 --> 00:01:54,322
waltzing through that door
any day now,

46
00:01:54,364 --> 00:01:55,824
and she is
going to be screaming,

47
00:01:55,866 --> 00:01:58,827
"Make sure you frisk
that girl before..."

48
00:01:59,828 --> 00:02:01,288
I'll be fine.

49
00:02:03,331 --> 00:02:04,708
-That's my perfume.
-Mm, good.

50
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:06,835
Okay, good.
She wouldn't wear that.

00:06:47,991 --> 00:06:52,287
And even if you can't,
you're not the boss of me.

175
00:06:53,538 --> 00:06:55,832
Can I go to...?
I'm going to the park!

176
00:06:56,917 --> 00:06:58,501
Oh, Buster.

177
00:06:58,543 --> 00:07:00,587
Hello.

178
00:07:00,628 --> 00:07:02,421
Hello to you, too, 2.

179
00:07:02,463 --> 00:07:04,591
Oh, look at all this produce.

180
00:07:04,632 --> 00:07:06,801
I'm juicing now.
Would you like to join me?

181
00:07:06,843 --> 00:07:09,221
It's 2:00 in the afternoon.

182
00:07:09,263 --> 00:07:10,764
Honey, it's 8:00 a.m. somewhere.

183
00:07:10,805 --> 00:07:12,224
Oh, I forgot--

184
00:07:12,266 --> 00:07:13,641
your mother wouldn't allow it.

185
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:16,686
(loudly):
I don't care what she wants.

186
00:07:16,728 --> 00:07:19,314
(quietly):
Don't care what she wants.

187
00:07:19,356 --> 00:07:22,067
I don't do everything
she tells me.

188
00:07:22,109 --> 00:07:24,652
Let's get juiced.

189
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:29,283
NARRATOR:
<i>The next morning, Buster awoke</i>

190
00:07:29,324 --> 00:07:30,784
<i>-with a vicious juice hangover.</i>
-Oh.

191
00:07:32,244 --> 00:07:33,912
Well, that was a freebie.

192
00:07:33,954 --> 00:07:35,330
(gasps)

193
00:07:35,372 --> 00:07:36,873
Mother's trial.

194
00:07:36,915 --> 00:07:38,458
(whimpers loudly)

195
00:07:40,085 --> 00:07:41,461
BUSTER:
Key witness!

196
00:07:41,502 --> 00:07:43,171
Key witness coming through.

197
00:07:43,213 --> 00:07:44,714
I'm a key... I...

198
00:07:44,756 --> 00:07:46,507
I was making two ban...

199
00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:48,051
(whimpers)

200
00:07:48,093 --> 00:07:51,263
MARINES: Late last night,
it was drizzling rain!

201
00:07:51,305 --> 00:07:53,223
I'm a key witness.

202
00:07:53,265 --> 00:07:55,683
(Buster whimpering)

203
00:07:55,725 --> 00:07:57,060
Is it over?

204
00:07:57,102 --> 00:07:59,229
No, no, the
grab-a-crab fest just started.

205
00:07:59,271 --> 00:08:00,605
Grab-a-crab?

206
00:08:00,647 --> 00:08:03,191
Oh, ma'am, um...
is-is there a verdict

207
00:08:03,233 --> 00:08:05,026
in the "my mother stole
the<i> Queen Mary"</i> thing?

208
00:08:05,068 --> 00:08:06,653
It's all up
on the dailies board.

209
00:08:06,694 --> 00:08:09,156
Dailies? What?
Clam ch... (gasps)

210
00:08:09,197 --> 00:08:11,574
LUCILLE:
The fish is frozen here!

211
00:08:11,616 --> 00:08:15,495
It's frozen! Do you really want
to spend $30 on frozen fish?

212
00:08:15,536 --> 00:08:16,913
(gasps) Buster.

213
00:08:16,955 --> 00:08:19,458
Where were you?
This is all your fault.

214
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:20,750
No, I was making...
was making a ban...

215
00:08:20,792 --> 00:08:22,210
-I was making two ban...
-Save it.

216
00:08:22,252 --> 00:08:24,004
I can smell the cran-apple
on you from here.

217
00:08:24,045 --> 00:08:26,006
When... when are you
coming home?

218
00:08:26,047 --> 00:08:27,632
I'm serving three to five.

219
00:08:27,674 --> 00:08:29,509
(gasps)
Like the saltless pie?

220
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:32,471
I hope your juicy
blender bender was worth it.

221
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:35,140
Don't come to visit me
because I won't see you.

222
00:08:35,182 --> 00:08:36,933
Oh, and good luck
with your night terrors.

223
00:08:36,975 --> 00:08:39,811
Now no one will be there
to hear your screams.

224
00:08:39,853 --> 00:08:41,313
(screams)

225
00:08:41,355 --> 00:08:44,191
Won't miss it!

226
00:08:45,442 --> 00:08:47,652
Where... where do I go?

227
00:08:47,694 --> 00:08:49,070
What do I do?

228
00:08:49,112 --> 00:08:51,531
Where... where'd you
get the pirate hat?

229
00:08:51,572 --> 00:08:53,325
Where... where do I go?

230
00:08:53,367 --> 00:08:55,369
NARRATOR:<i> And so Buster</i>
<i>went back to the penthouse,</i>

231
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:58,372
<i>feeling guilty and alone.</i>

232
00:08:58,413 --> 00:09:01,041
<i>And he couldn't bear to relive</i>
<i>the time he was there</i>

233
00:09:01,082 --> 00:09:02,501
<i>without Lucille before.</i>

234
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:05,253
I can't go through
another two days like that.

235
00:09:05,295 --> 00:09:07,255
<i>And that's how Buster decided</i>
<i>to make another go</i>

236
00:09:07,297 --> 00:09:09,757
<i>at making another go</i>
<i>at Lucille 2.</i>

237
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:11,176
Buster.

238
00:09:11,218 --> 00:09:12,635
My mother's gone away,

239
00:09:12,677 --> 00:09:14,471
and I thought,
you've always been like a...

240
00:09:14,513 --> 00:09:16,515
-Girlfriend.
-Not what I was gonna say.

241
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:18,850
Anyways, I was over there,
and my friend's over here,

242
00:09:18,892 --> 00:09:21,102
and I thought, maybe I
should just move in,

243
00:09:21,144 --> 00:09:23,813
because I love to hear
all about your medications

244
00:09:23,855 --> 00:09:25,357
and ailments and whatnot.

245
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:27,401
Is that baby toe of yours
still crawling

246
00:09:27,442 --> 00:09:29,277
over the others
like a weird weed?

247
00:09:29,319 --> 00:09:31,530
Oh, Buster, how sweet
of you to remember.

248
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:32,989
Oh, it's one
of my night terrors.

249
00:09:33,031 --> 00:09:34,366
But listen, Buster,

250
00:09:34,408 --> 00:09:37,077
-before I invite you
into my arms... -Mm-hmm.

251
00:09:37,118 --> 00:09:40,121
my bedroom, my bathtub
with the railing...

252
00:09:40,163 --> 00:09:43,041
-Mm-hmm.
-I have to ask you something.

253
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:44,251
Mm-hmm.

254
00:09:44,292 --> 00:09:45,835
Are you sure
you're ready for this?

255
00:09:47,462 --> 00:09:50,424
So, that pretend kid's bedroom,
is that not an option...?

256
00:09:50,465 --> 00:09:52,842
No, that room
is all storage now, honey.

257
00:09:52,884 --> 00:09:54,761
So, yes or no?

258
00:09:54,802 --> 00:09:57,389
Are you ready to let go
of your mother?

259
00:09:57,431 --> 00:09:58,806
NARRATOR:
<i>Buster thought he was,</i>

260
00:09:58,848 --> 00:10:01,393
<i>although there</i>
<i>was one ominous sign.</i>

261
00:10:01,435 --> 00:10:03,770
I am ready for that, Lucille.

262
00:10:05,897 --> 00:10:07,315
<i>Did you hear it?</i>

263
00:10:10,193 --> 00:10:13,154
Wait. Did you just drop the 2
after my name?

264
00:10:13,196 --> 00:10:15,198
(laughing):
Oh, I hope not.

265
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,742
That would be creepy.

266
00:10:17,784 --> 00:10:19,744
<i>Before you accidentally</i>
<i>skip back too far</i>

267
00:10:19,786 --> 00:10:22,539
<i>and wind up in the middle</i>
<i>of the Maeby episode,</i>

268
00:10:22,581 --> 00:10:25,083
<i>trust me, no "2" was spoken.</i>

269
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:28,336
<i>Every day,</i>
<i>Buster visited the prison</i>

270
00:10:28,378 --> 00:10:30,880
<i>where his mother</i>
<i>was incarcerated.</i>

271
00:10:30,922 --> 00:10:33,258
Buster Bluth and pie
for his m...

272
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:35,260
(sighs) Lucille Bluth.

273
00:10:36,677 --> 00:10:37,845
Hmm...

274
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:41,433
<i>And every day,</i>
<i>she refused to see him.</i>

275
00:10:41,475 --> 00:10:42,683
LUCILLE:
No.

276
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:43,935
BUSTER:
Oh.

277
00:10:43,977 --> 00:10:45,228
She doesn't want to see you.

278
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:47,355
Excellent.

279
00:10:49,566 --> 00:10:51,401
(crying)

280
00:10:51,443 --> 00:10:53,320
<i>He even pretended to be</i>

281
00:10:53,361 --> 00:10:56,531
<i>an old college flame of</i>
<i>Lucille's to gain admittance.</i>

282
00:10:56,573 --> 00:10:58,741
Hello.

283
00:11:01,828 --> 00:11:03,455
Alex Trebek?

284
00:11:03,497 --> 00:11:05,873
<i>She then rephrased it</i>
<i>in the form of a question.</i>

285
00:11:05,915 --> 00:11:07,834
Who is Alex Trebek?

286
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:09,710
Buster.

287
00:11:12,631 --> 00:11:15,175
-No, Buster.
-Mm-hmm.

288
00:11:16,843 --> 00:11:21,139
Do you have a pie or a small
sponge cake available?

289
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:24,225
-Ah. Thank you.
-Here you go.

290
00:11:24,267 --> 00:11:26,603
<i>And while his days were spent</i>
<i>trying to get</i>

291
00:11:26,645 --> 00:11:28,396
<i>-his mother to love him...</i> 
-LUCILLE 2: Oh, Buster!

292
00:11:28,438 --> 00:11:30,273
-You're just in time.
<i>-...his nights were consumed</i>

293
00:11:30,315 --> 00:11:31,816
<i>with getting his lover</i>
<i>to mother him.</i>

294
00:11:31,858 --> 00:11:34,528
I hope you are in the mood
for a hot tomato.

295
00:11:34,569 --> 00:11:36,029
Mmm. Soup?

296
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:38,156
With little grilled cheese
sandwiches on the side.

297
00:11:38,198 --> 00:11:40,534
Buster, that was innuendo.

298
00:11:40,575 --> 00:11:42,035
-Oh.
-My Lord, it's like

299
00:11:42,076 --> 00:11:43,911
we're speaking different
languages here.

300
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:45,330
No, it's not.

301
00:11:45,372 --> 00:11:46,665
It is working.

302
00:11:46,705 --> 00:11:48,791
I'm getting hungry.

303
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:50,960
For love?

304
00:11:51,002 --> 00:11:52,420
Oh, God, is this another

305
00:11:52,462 --> 00:11:55,173
one of those nights
where nothing is as it seems

306
00:11:55,215 --> 00:11:57,425
and there's no cream pie
for dessert?

307
00:11:57,467 --> 00:11:59,469
Holy Toledo, Buster,
sometimes I think

308
00:11:59,511 --> 00:12:02,222
I'm nothing but
a Horn &amp; Hardart to you.

309
00:12:02,263 --> 00:12:04,015
Oh! What happened to innuendo?

310
00:12:04,057 --> 00:12:05,766
Let's do it quick.

311
00:12:05,808 --> 00:12:07,894
It's an old restaurant.

312
00:12:07,935 --> 00:12:09,688
(laughing):
Oh! A restaurant!

313
00:12:09,728 --> 00:12:11,147
I don't care if it's old!

314
00:12:11,189 --> 00:12:12,440
Look who I'm dating!

315
00:12:12,482 --> 00:12:14,234
Let's go there.
Let's go there now.

316
00:12:14,275 --> 00:12:18,446
Buster, you can either
be a son or a lover...

317
00:12:18,488 --> 00:12:21,115
and right now,
you're no good to me as a lover.

318
00:12:21,157 --> 00:12:23,326
Maybe you're right.

319
00:12:23,368 --> 00:12:26,871
Maybe this has been wrong
from the start.

320
00:12:26,913 --> 00:12:29,082
-So... Mom.
-Out.

321
00:12:29,123 --> 00:12:30,709
<i>And since he couldn't bear</i>

322
00:12:30,749 --> 00:12:32,168
<i>-to go back to the</i>
<i>penthouse...</i> -Out!

323
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:33,420
You know, if tomorrow,
you don't open up

324
00:12:33,461 --> 00:12:34,837
and let someone else in...

325
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:36,423
<i>...Buster needed</i>
<i>to raise some money.</i>

326
00:12:36,464 --> 00:12:38,550
(on TV): ...then the treasures
you have inside...

327
00:12:38,592 --> 00:12:40,510
This is my Motherboy Four medal.

328
00:12:40,552 --> 00:12:42,929
That's when I was a kangaroo
in her pouch.

329
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:44,931
What'll you give me for it?

330
00:12:44,972 --> 00:12:49,436
<i>But Buster wasn't the first</i>
<i>Motherboy to hit hard times.</i>

331
00:12:49,477 --> 00:12:51,438
What will you give me
for these?

332
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:53,022
All-time low.

333
00:12:53,064 --> 00:12:55,316
<i>And that's when Buster</i>
<i>found inspiration.</i>

334
00:12:55,358 --> 00:12:58,278
She certainly looks proud
of her son.

335
00:13:00,655 --> 00:13:03,157
(singsongy):
I'm back!

336
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:06,202
<i>As it turned out, Buster</i>
<i>returned on the very day</i>

337
00:13:06,244 --> 00:13:09,664
<i>the Army policy regarding</i>
<i>sexual orientation had changed.</i>

338
00:13:09,706 --> 00:13:11,790
-Are you gay?
-No.

339
00:13:11,832 --> 00:13:12,959
-You can tell me.
-I'm not.

340
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,127
SOLDIER 2:
It's okay.

341
00:13:14,168 --> 00:13:15,002
Drew, tell him.

342
00:13:15,044 --> 00:13:16,713
-I'm gay.
-Oh.

343
00:13:16,755 --> 00:13:17,922
-Peter's gay.
-Oh...

344
00:13:17,964 --> 00:13:19,006
-Sergeant Melnick's gay.
-Oh.

345
00:13:19,048 --> 00:13:20,133
(sighing):
Bi.

346
00:13:20,174 --> 00:13:21,926
Oh, sorry, he's bi.

347
00:13:21,968 --> 00:13:23,428
No, I'm going home
for the day.

348
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:24,803
I'm gay.

349
00:13:24,845 --> 00:13:26,264
Yeah, it really makes
no difference to us.

350
00:13:26,306 --> 00:13:28,642
-We'll find something for you.
-Perfect.

351
00:13:28,683 --> 00:13:30,851
I was looking for something.

352
00:13:32,562 --> 00:13:33,896
You said "something," right?

353
00:13:33,938 --> 00:13:35,523
<i>And that's how Buster</i>
<i>officially</i>

354
00:13:35,565 --> 00:13:37,651
<i>reenlisted in the Army.</i>

355
00:13:37,692 --> 00:13:40,111
<i>And it's why, six months later,</i>

356
00:13:40,153 --> 00:13:41,154
-SOLDIER: Lucille Bluth.<i> </i>
<i>-Lucille Bluth</i>

357
00:13:41,195 --> 00:13:42,697
<i>got some bad news.</i>

358
00:13:42,739 --> 00:13:45,032
Yes?

359
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:48,119
I'm here to see you
about your son.

360
00:13:48,161 --> 00:13:49,412
Oh, this is a ploy.

361
00:13:49,454 --> 00:13:50,955
He's trying to get me
to see him.

362
00:13:50,997 --> 00:13:52,873
How do I know
you're really in the Army?

363
00:13:52,915 --> 00:13:55,585
Who did Larry Kert replace
in Company?

364
00:13:55,627 --> 00:13:56,961
I don't know.

365
00:13:57,003 --> 00:13:58,755
I know who he thought
he was replacing,

366
00:13:58,797 --> 00:14:00,674
and it was Dean Jones.

367
00:14:00,715 --> 00:14:02,091
But he didn't come close.

368
00:14:02,133 --> 00:14:03,677
(shudders anxiously)

369
00:14:03,718 --> 00:14:05,512
My Buster?

370
00:14:05,553 --> 00:14:06,721
<i>And Lucille rushed</i>
<i>to the hospital.</i>

371
00:14:06,763 --> 00:14:08,847
What happened?
Where's my son?

372
00:14:08,889 --> 00:14:11,142
Mrs. Bluth, your son went down
while piloting a plane

373
00:14:11,184 --> 00:14:14,020
-over Afghanistan.
-Oh, my God...

374
00:14:14,061 --> 00:14:16,606
He deserves a big hand for that
and we gave him one.

375
00:14:16,648 --> 00:14:19,526
I'm afraid, besides that,
there's nothing we can do.

376
00:14:22,987 --> 00:14:24,155
(Buster gasps)

377
00:14:24,197 --> 00:14:25,532
Hi, Mother.

378
00:14:26,658 --> 00:14:27,867
Well, you look fine.

379
00:14:27,908 --> 00:14:29,202
The doctor said you went down

380
00:14:29,243 --> 00:14:31,579
while piloting a plane
over Afghanistan.

381
00:14:31,621 --> 00:14:33,790
Oh, yeah, that plane
was in Afghanistan.

382
00:14:33,832 --> 00:14:35,916
<i>It seems the Army</i>
<i>had taken advantage</i>

383
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:38,670
<i>of Buster's childlike</i>
<i>interest in games.</i>

384
00:14:38,712 --> 00:14:41,673
This is so much more fun
than "Guess the Fur."

385
00:14:41,715 --> 00:14:44,967
<i>And his childlike inability</i>
<i>to distinguish</i>

386
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:47,387
<i>-between games and reality.</i> 
-Oh! (laughs)

387
00:14:47,428 --> 00:14:50,640
<i>So they set him up</i>
<i>as a drone pilot here.</i>

388
00:14:50,682 --> 00:14:53,267
Want to go to lunch,
Private Bluth?

389
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:56,604
Not till I take out
the hospital!

390
00:14:56,646 --> 00:14:58,565
I tell you,
this kid's amazing.

391
00:14:58,606 --> 00:15:02,151
If I had him back in the '60s,
Cuba would be the 51st state.

392
00:15:02,193 --> 00:15:05,363
You're not gonna get away
from me, little nurse! Aah!

393
00:15:05,405 --> 00:15:07,490
<i>He had been playing</i>
<i>for 47 straight hours.</i>

394
00:15:07,532 --> 00:15:11,160
Take that, Taliban wedding!
(laughing wildly)

395
00:15:11,202 --> 00:15:14,288
<i>But like anyone who plays</i>
<i>video games for too long,</i>

396
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:15,874
<i>he started to make mistakes.</i>

397
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:18,710
Hey, Bluth, you just took out
an art museum in Madrid.

398
00:15:18,752 --> 00:15:20,503
Oh, you can go to Spain
in this thing?

399
00:15:20,545 --> 00:15:21,880
Maybe you should take a break.

400
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:23,005
You could've hurt
some innocent people.

401
00:15:23,047 --> 00:15:24,090
Innocent people?!

402
00:15:24,131 --> 00:15:25,800
(gasps)
You mean I've been

403
00:15:25,842 --> 00:15:27,427
hurting guilty people?!

404
00:15:27,468 --> 00:15:30,346
<i>But Buster was a peaceful man.</i>

405
00:15:30,388 --> 00:15:31,723
(Buster screaming)
Oh, God!

406
00:15:31,765 --> 00:15:32,891
Pilot down!

407
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:34,601
-(alarm wailing)
-Medic!

408
00:15:34,642 --> 00:15:36,436
<i>It was the kind of emergency</i>

409
00:15:36,477 --> 00:15:37,854
<i>that the drone pilot paramedics</i>
<i>had long been waiting for.</i>

410
00:15:37,896 --> 00:15:39,230
I got a man down!

411
00:15:39,272 --> 00:15:40,774
Sorry we're late.

412
00:15:40,815 --> 00:15:42,483
Some kid swallowed an eye
at the Build-A-Bear.

413
00:15:42,525 --> 00:15:44,861
Why do they have us
at a mini-mall?

414
00:15:44,903 --> 00:15:46,112
-(defibrillator clacks, whines)
<i>-It was the first</i>

415
00:15:46,153 --> 00:15:47,363
<i>known injury to a drone pilot</i>

416
00:15:47,405 --> 00:15:49,115
<i>and the Army took it seriously.</i>

417
00:15:49,156 --> 00:15:51,785
Apparently, no one told him
that they were real planes.

418
00:15:51,826 --> 00:15:53,202
If this guy comes after us,

419
00:15:53,244 --> 00:15:55,413
they could pull funding
for the whole program.

420
00:15:55,455 --> 00:15:57,707
So, how do we buy off
ol' One Arm?

421
00:15:57,749 --> 00:16:00,042
First we gotta find
something he needs.

422
00:16:00,084 --> 00:16:02,336
Well, we do have
the bionics program.

423
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:04,130
Ice cream.

424
00:16:04,171 --> 00:16:06,507
Maybe we shouldn't be
discussing this here.

425
00:16:06,549 --> 00:16:08,802
Yeah, I think
we're at those kids' table.

426
00:16:10,094 --> 00:16:11,596
So you fell out of a chair,

427
00:16:11,638 --> 00:16:13,848
and for this, the government
gives you applause?

428
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:16,309
No-- a big hand.

429
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:19,813
I thought I recognized that
little son of a bitch.

430
00:16:19,854 --> 00:16:21,898
This is why you can't keep a job

431
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:23,232
(muffled):
at one hospital!

432
00:16:23,274 --> 00:16:26,778
Why does it
have to be so big?

433
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:29,739
Well, they said the
miniaturization comes later.

434
00:16:29,781 --> 00:16:33,117
I mean, you remember how big
your first cell phone was.

435
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:34,953
That was a phone.

436
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:37,497
This looks like you're pointing
to a place that buys your gold.

437
00:16:37,538 --> 00:16:39,582
I haven't learned
how to control it.

438
00:16:39,624 --> 00:16:41,167
They're gonna work with me.

439
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:43,461
So you had me come out here
under false pretenses?

440
00:16:43,503 --> 00:16:45,880
You wouldn't come here
any other way!

441
00:16:45,922 --> 00:16:47,507
You haven't seen me in a year.

442
00:16:47,548 --> 00:16:50,176
It's why I went to Army--
to win you back.

443
00:16:50,217 --> 00:16:52,470
You have to forgive me!

444
00:16:52,512 --> 00:16:54,973
It's not about forgiving you.
Although I don't.

445
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:56,933
-(groans)
-You need to grow up, Buster,

446
00:16:56,975 --> 00:16:59,602
because I can't
take care of you anymore.

447
00:16:59,644 --> 00:17:02,480
I need to "get away-get away."

448
00:17:02,522 --> 00:17:04,774
You're hopelessly hopeless,
Buster.

449
00:17:04,816 --> 00:17:07,067
It's as if they wrote
that song for my own son.

450
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:10,112
-Hm?
-I'm glad you have a new hand.

451
00:17:10,154 --> 00:17:12,323
But you need to find
someone else to hold it.

452
00:17:12,365 --> 00:17:14,951
Tell the prison limo
to come around!

453
00:17:14,993 --> 00:17:18,162
Fine! I got
my own family now-- Army!

454
00:17:18,204 --> 00:17:19,706
And they want me!

455
00:17:19,747 --> 00:17:20,957
You guys want me, right?

456
00:17:20,999 --> 00:17:22,583
Oh, yeah.
They're not gonna invest

457
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:24,293
this kind of money
without wanting you for keeps.

458
00:17:24,335 --> 00:17:26,462
-(laughing): Oh, good.
-Once you learn how to use

459
00:17:26,504 --> 00:17:27,714
that thing,
they're going to turn you

460
00:17:27,755 --> 00:17:28,673
into a killing monster.

461
00:17:28,715 --> 00:17:30,424
Monster...?

462
00:17:30,466 --> 00:17:31,968
This doesn't make me look sexy.

463
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:33,177
Throw it out.

464
00:17:33,219 --> 00:17:35,304
Well, that explains
the photo shoot.

465
00:17:36,639 --> 00:17:38,850
<i>And so Buster</i>
<i>began a rehab program</i>

466
00:17:38,892 --> 00:17:40,434
<i>he was terrified to succeed at.</i>

467
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:42,020
Open the cabinet, please.

468
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:46,482
Mm... mm... mm... mm!

469
00:17:46,524 --> 00:17:47,775
Oh...

470
00:17:47,817 --> 00:17:49,193
Too hard.

471
00:17:49,235 --> 00:17:50,737
Uh, I think that was too hard.

472
00:17:50,778 --> 00:17:51,946
-Okay.
-Yeah.

473
00:17:51,988 --> 00:17:54,699
Let's just grab
that toothpaste.

474
00:17:54,741 --> 00:17:56,158
Okay.

475
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,994
-Use your new hand.
-Okay.

476
00:17:58,036 --> 00:17:59,704
Oh!

477
00:17:59,746 --> 00:18:01,288
I got some on you.

478
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:03,457
Uh... yeah.

479
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:06,252
-You did get some on me.
-Yeah.

480
00:18:06,293 --> 00:18:08,671
-Too hard?<i> -Buster seemed slow</i>
<i>to master the challenges.</i>

481
00:18:08,713 --> 00:18:11,131
GUNNER:
Yeah, that's... that's on her.

482
00:18:11,173 --> 00:18:13,300
-He got a little...
-It was too hard.

483
00:18:13,342 --> 00:18:14,886
I think it was, as well.

484
00:18:14,928 --> 00:18:17,805
Let's go ahead and fast-forward
through the commercials.

485
00:18:17,847 --> 00:18:19,306
Okay, that's too fa--
okay, stop.

486
00:18:19,348 --> 00:18:20,808
Well, there's Jon Cryer.

487
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:22,184
Stop! That's Jon Cryer!

488
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:23,394
(remote blipping)

489
00:18:23,436 --> 00:18:24,938
Well, look at that--

490
00:18:24,979 --> 00:18:26,814
we're back at the Progressive
Insurance lady.

491
00:18:26,856 --> 00:18:29,275
I'm better off just watching
the commercials!

492
00:18:29,316 --> 00:18:30,818
Don't say that.

493
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:32,904
<i>But behind the two-way mirror,</i>

494
00:18:32,946 --> 00:18:35,197
<i>hope wasn't in abundance.</i>

495
00:18:35,239 --> 00:18:37,909
Hope this guy likes the music
acts on Saturday Night Live

496
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:40,202
because he's gonna be
watching a lot of them.

497
00:18:40,244 --> 00:18:42,622
-How many remotes do we have?
-That was the only one.

498
00:18:42,663 --> 00:18:44,707
There's seven monitors here--
we have one remote.

499
00:18:44,749 --> 00:18:46,292
Do we have anybody
from Pinky Team?

500
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:48,086
PHYSICAL THERAPIST:
Guys, he can't do this!

501
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:50,922
<i>And around week five,</i>
<i>the Army finally realized</i>

502
00:18:50,964 --> 00:18:53,674
<i>that Buster</i>
<i>was in no hurry to leave.</i>

503
00:18:53,716 --> 00:18:55,760
Aah! I blew it again!

504
00:18:55,802 --> 00:18:57,177
I'll never do it right!

505
00:18:57,219 --> 00:18:59,639
I'm a monst--

506
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,307
Do you have any ice cream?

507
00:19:01,348 --> 00:19:03,476
Maybe it would work
with ice cream.

508
00:19:03,517 --> 00:19:05,227
And now he wants ice cream.

509
00:19:05,269 --> 00:19:07,313
He's using us.

510
00:19:07,354 --> 00:19:09,649
Yeah, it might be time
for the Q-test.

511
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:11,442
The Q-test?

512
00:19:15,029 --> 00:19:16,739
Oh...

513
00:19:16,781 --> 00:19:18,699
I'm sorry, we're running behind
with your testing, Buster.

514
00:19:18,741 --> 00:19:20,451
We'll just be
a few more minutes.

515
00:19:20,493 --> 00:19:22,078
Okay.

516
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:23,913
(gasps)
Oh... well...!

517
00:19:23,955 --> 00:19:25,957
<i>And it was then that Gunner</i>
<i>learned why</i>

518
00:19:25,999 --> 00:19:27,834
<i>-it was called the Q-test.</i> 
-Oh.

519
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:30,711
Aren't you the "cu-test"?

520
00:19:30,753 --> 00:19:34,882
COLONEL: Now, he can't see us
at all-- that's correct?

521
00:19:34,924 --> 00:19:36,843
-(cat meowing)
-BUSTER: I know!

522
00:19:36,884 --> 00:19:38,552
GUNNER: Why wouldn't
he be able to see us?

523
00:19:38,594 --> 00:19:41,055
-BUSTER: You looking around?
-Because it's a mirror.

524
00:19:41,097 --> 00:19:43,349
No, it's a window.

525
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:45,267
-(cat purring)
-BUSTER: Oh, hi.

526
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:49,522
COLONEL:
Okay, let's take it down.

527
00:19:49,563 --> 00:19:51,107
BUSTER:
I know, I know...

528
00:19:52,274 --> 00:19:54,027
COLONEL:
Send in the authority figure.

529
00:19:54,068 --> 00:19:56,403
-Hi. -(cat purring)
-(door opens)

530
00:19:56,445 --> 00:19:58,238
(clears throat)

531
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:00,616
How are you managing
with that hand, solider?

532
00:20:00,658 --> 00:20:02,118
(Buster gasps)

533
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:04,037
(cat meowing,
Buster whimpering)

534
00:20:04,078 --> 00:20:06,246
(cat meowing)

535
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:11,210
(Buster whimpers)

536
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:17,008
<i>Buster was being discharged</i>
<i>from the Army.</i>

537
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:18,926
So, where am I supposed
to go?

538
00:20:18,968 --> 00:20:20,427
What am I supposed to do?

539
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:22,429
I-I have nowhere to live.

540
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:25,224
You should've thought about that
before you let that cat live.

541
00:20:25,265 --> 00:20:27,226
<i>-And that's when he met</i>
<i>Ophelia Love,</i> -Oh, I'm sorry.

<i>-of the Veterans' Hospital.</i> 
-Excuse me.

545
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,109
You're a veteran
and you have nowhere to go?

546
00:20:35,151 --> 00:20:36,527
Oh, it's not Army's fault.

547
00:20:36,569 --> 00:20:38,320
I'm a monster.

548
00:20:38,362 --> 00:20:40,114
And what makes you think
you're a monster?

549
00:20:40,156 --> 00:20:42,116
What do you see
when you look at this?

550
00:20:42,158 --> 00:20:45,995
I see a veteran whose hand
I'd like to shake.

551
00:20:46,037 --> 00:20:47,997
Not that one.

552
00:20:48,039 --> 00:20:50,374
I think you should
meet my husband.

553
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:52,292
We may have something for you.

554
00:20:52,334 --> 00:20:54,795
Perfect! Wait, you didn't
say "nothing," did you?

555
00:20:54,837 --> 00:20:57,840
-Something.
-"Something." Got it.

556
00:20:57,882 --> 00:20:59,425
HERBERT:
Look how big his hand is.

557
00:20:59,466 --> 00:21:01,094
<i>But Herbert would be</i>
<i>less enthusiastic.</i>

558
00:21:01,135 --> 00:21:02,720
And you want him
to live with us?

559
00:21:02,762 --> 00:21:04,889
Well, he's a vet, Herbert.

560
00:21:04,931 --> 00:21:07,016
And you yourself
said you need something

561
00:21:07,058 --> 00:21:09,309
to compete with the woman
you're running against.

562
00:21:09,351 --> 00:21:13,064
<i>Lucille 2 had recently adopted</i>
<i>a Hispanic boy named Perfecto.</i>

563
00:21:13,106 --> 00:21:14,690
And since
you're never around, I mean,

564
00:21:14,732 --> 00:21:16,192
he could help me with the boys.

565
00:21:16,234 --> 00:21:18,569
It's like that movie
<i>The Blind Side.</i>

566
00:21:18,611 --> 00:21:22,698
I suppose we could use
a Blind Side Monster.

567
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:25,201
Well, we shouldn't
call him a monster.

568
00:21:25,243 --> 00:21:27,161
That's why I love you, Ophelia.

569
00:21:27,203 --> 00:21:32,125
You've got a heart as big as
that Blind Side Monster's hand.

570
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:33,793

571
00:21:33,834 --> 00:21:35,002

-Oh!

572
00:21:35,044 --> 00:21:37,004
<i>And so it was decided</i>

573
00:21:37,046 --> 00:21:39,132
<i>Buster was to stay</i>
<i>with the Love family.</i>

574
00:21:39,173 --> 00:21:42,176
He's fine. He's fine.
He's fine.

575
00:21:42,218 --> 00:21:44,011
-Welcome to the family.
-Oh!

576
00:21:44,053 --> 00:21:46,097
<i>He'd found a home at last.</i>

577
00:21:46,139 --> 00:21:47,974
-Oh!
-Oh! Uh-uh, uh-uh!

578

Really.

584
00:22:01,445 --> 00:22:03,530
Well, what about these two guys?

585
00:22:03,572 --> 00:22:04,824
Were they invited?

586
00:22:04,865 --> 00:22:06,117
Light drizzle...

587
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:07,785
and thunder.

588
00:22:07,827 --> 00:22:10,955
-What?! -See, light drizzle
will just annoy you

589
00:22:10,997 --> 00:22:15,084
but, you see, thunder...
will "F" you up!

590
00:22:15,126 --> 00:22:17,753
<i>This got the attention</i>

<i>vice president of the student</i>

You're never too old
to stand up to a bully.

Whether he's an attention hog
who looks just like you,

596
00:22:31,267 --> 00:22:33,019
or whether he's half your size.

597

(growls, giggles, screams)

598
00:22:36,272 --> 00:22:38,941

You throw in some cola...

604
00:22:47,241 --> 00:22:49,409
Got a Coke and Hennessy!

(laughs)

606
00:22:50,911 --> 00:22:52,663
Just for you, Mother Love.

607

-Buster...
-Mm...

608
00:22:54,290 --> 00:22:56,834
You are the most considerate man
I've ever met.

609
00:22:56,876 --> 00:22:59,879
Oh, stop!
You're embarrassing me!

610
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,588

611
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:03,674
No, I'm serious--
stop, stop.

612
00:23:03,716 --> 00:23:04,967
But your other hand
is waving me on.

613
00:23:05,009 --> 00:23:06,635
Oh, is that going again?

614
00:23:06,677 --> 00:23:08,221
I think it's on demo.

615
00:23:08,262 --> 00:23:10,306
Do you have a pencil
or a paper clip?

616
00:23:10,348 --> 00:23:12,725
<i>And he helped Herbert</i>
<i>on the campaign trail.</i>

617
00:23:12,766 --> 00:23:14,977
...let me show you what a
government handout looks like.

618
00:23:15,019 --> 00:23:16,394
Hold your government hand out.

619
00:23:16,436 --> 00:23:20,024
Yeah! And let's give freedom
from government

620
00:23:20,066 --> 00:23:21,859
a big thumbs-up!

621
00:23:21,901 --> 00:23:24,402

<i>complete mastery.</i>

-Come on, Buster, dance!
-I don't want to dance.

623
00:23:26,697 --> 00:23:28,574
Come on, dance, Buster!

624
00:23:28,615 --> 00:23:29,992
<i>Buster was enjoying</i>
<i>his new role</i>

625
00:23:30,034 --> 00:23:32,536
<i>as a symbol</i>
<i>of government waste.</i>

626
00:23:32,578 --> 00:23:34,412
It's like I said
about contraception:

627
00:23:34,454 --> 00:23:36,456
If you want me
to pay for her diaphragm,

628
00:23:36,498 --> 00:23:40,294
-I get to put my hand in her--
-Shoe!

629
00:23:40,336 --> 00:23:42,922
Nice stop, Blind Side Monster.

630
00:23:42,963 --> 00:23:45,216
Buster-- Blind Side Buster.

631
00:23:45,258 --> 00:23:47,801
<i>And he was feeling</i>
<i>more confident every day.</i>

632
00:23:47,843 --> 00:23:49,095
Mm!

633
00:23:49,136 --> 00:23:50,554
HERBERT:
Okay...

634
00:23:50,596 --> 00:23:53,015
Give him a big hand back!

(applause)

636
00:23:54,767 --> 00:23:56,060
<i>Arguably, too confident.</i> 

637
00:23:56,102 --> 00:23:59,063
HERBERT:
Hey!

638
00:23:59,105 --> 00:24:00,522
(Buster giggling)

639
00:24:00,564 --> 00:24:01,565
Okay, hey, hey...
Oh-ho!

640
00:24:01,607 --> 00:24:03,901
BUSTER:
Hah! Hm! (giggles)

641
00:24:03,943 --> 00:24:05,403
<i>Although,</i>
<i>after this appearance,</i>

642
00:24:05,443 --> 00:24:08,697
<i>he spent a lot less time</i>
<i>with Herbert.</i>

643
00:24:08,739 --> 00:24:11,909
<i>And a lot more time</i>
<i>with Ophelia.</i>

644
00:24:11,951 --> 00:24:13,911
-(people screaming)
<i>-Which is what led to this.</i>

645
00:24:17,415 --> 00:24:19,625
That's funny, no smoke came out.

646
00:24:19,666 --> 00:24:21,210
Smoke?

647
00:24:21,252 --> 00:24:22,420
Wait, what just happened?

648
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:24,213
This.

649
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:28,426
Okay, okay, okay.

650
00:24:28,466 --> 00:24:30,468
So you don't think
that the next level

651
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:32,470
is adult adoption, do you?

652
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:34,932
Come on, Buster.

653
00:24:34,974 --> 00:24:37,475
You've been flirting with me
since day one.

654
00:24:37,517 --> 00:24:38,476
What?

655
00:24:38,518 --> 00:24:39,937
Bringing me these flowers,

656
00:24:39,979 --> 00:24:42,522
offering to undress me.

657
00:24:42,564 --> 00:24:43,983
What about the singing?

658
00:24:44,024 --> 00:24:48,362
"Sealed with a kiss" through
the door while I bathed?

659
00:24:48,404 --> 00:24:49,905
Right.

660
00:24:49,947 --> 00:24:51,573
Mother stuff.
(chuckles)

661
00:24:51,615 --> 00:24:54,660
(whispers):
I mean, you're married.

662
00:24:58,622 --> 00:25:00,082
What is this?

663
00:25:01,708 --> 00:25:05,254
That is my husband,
with a prostitute.

664
00:25:05,296 --> 00:25:09,716
I've worn a captain's hat with
someone who had hair like that.

665
00:25:09,758 --> 00:25:11,802
But I-I can't...

666
00:25:11,844 --> 00:25:14,888
I mean, you're like
a mother to me.

667
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:19,352
You can either be a son
or a lover to me.

668
00:25:19,393 --> 00:25:21,979
-(gasps)
-And I already have two sons.

669
00:25:22,021 --> 00:25:24,440
<i>And perhaps it was the fear</i>
<i>that she'd throw him out,</i>

670
00:25:24,482 --> 00:25:25,941
<i>or he finally did grow up,</i>

671
00:25:25,983 --> 00:25:29,611
<i>but that night,</i>
<i>Buster acted like a man.</i>

672
00:25:32,490 --> 00:25:34,616
NARRATOR:<i> After spending</i>
<i>the night with Ophelia Love,</i>

673
00:25:34,658 --> 00:25:36,202
<i>Buster proudly went</i>
<i>to visit his mother.</i>

674
00:25:36,243 --> 00:25:37,619
I came here to thank you.

675
00:25:37,661 --> 00:25:42,416
You were trying to push me
out of the nest...

676
00:25:42,458 --> 00:25:44,001
and you were right.

677
00:25:44,043 --> 00:25:45,378
-Really?
-Yes.

678
00:25:45,419 --> 00:25:46,670
I've grown.

679
00:25:46,712 --> 00:25:48,797
And I'm in love.

680
00:25:48,839 --> 00:25:50,508
Hamster or turtle?

681
00:25:50,548 --> 00:25:51,925
(laughs):
No, Mother.

682
00:25:51,967 --> 00:25:53,010
Hamsters are gross.

683
00:25:53,052 --> 00:25:54,345
It's a female.

684
00:25:54,387 --> 00:25:56,138
Human. Female human.
Whole thing.

685
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:59,099
So your parental
responsibilities are complete.

686
00:25:59,141 --> 00:26:00,184
Hot.

687
00:26:00,226 --> 00:26:03,396
I no longer need you.

688
00:26:03,437 --> 00:26:04,855
Well, you don't
have to go that far.

689
00:26:04,897 --> 00:26:06,690
I'm not a mother boy anymore.

690
00:26:07,816 --> 00:26:10,528
I'm a mother man.

691
00:26:15,324 --> 00:26:16,867
Use your good hand.

692
00:26:18,869 --> 00:26:20,704
Guards!

693
00:26:22,248 --> 00:26:24,666
<i>And on his way back</i>
<i>to his new love,</i>

694
00:26:24,708 --> 00:26:26,877
<i>Buster ran into Michael,</i>

695
00:26:26,919 --> 00:26:28,712
<i>who was trying to get</i>
<i>the life story rights</i>

696
00:26:28,754 --> 00:26:31,424
<i>from one of the few</i>
<i>remaining family members</i>

697
00:26:31,465 --> 00:26:33,884
<i>he hadn't thrown out</i>
<i>of the movie.</i>

698
00:26:33,926 --> 00:26:34,885
What about Mom?

699
00:26:34,927 --> 00:26:36,303
I have her, but I'm about to

700
00:26:36,345 --> 00:26:38,805
throw it in her face
when I see her,

701
00:26:38,847 --> 00:26:40,349
and I can't go to my son.

702
00:26:40,391 --> 00:26:42,893
Well, I have nothing
to be ashamed about.

703
00:26:42,935 --> 00:26:45,396
I'm in love.

704
00:26:45,438 --> 00:26:48,441
And do you want to hear
something so surprising?

705
00:26:48,482 --> 00:26:50,984
She started out
as my mother figure.

706
00:26:51,026 --> 00:26:52,986
-Not surprising.
<i>-And he returned back</i>

707
00:26:53,028 --> 00:26:56,323
<i>to his love nest</i>
<i>to tell Ophelia the good news.</i>

708
00:26:56,365 --> 00:26:57,866
I'm out of the thing!

709
00:26:57,908 --> 00:26:59,285
How did yours go?

710
00:26:59,326 --> 00:27:01,412
-It's over.
-(sighs)

711
00:27:01,454 --> 00:27:03,038
I talked to Herbert, I told him
everything about us,

712
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:04,039
and it's over.

713
00:27:04,081 --> 00:27:06,584
Mm. I know it's scary.

714
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:09,295
I just got out of
a long relationship, too.

715
00:27:09,336 --> 00:27:10,546
But I'm here for you.

716
00:27:10,588 --> 00:27:13,466
And, girl,
I ain't going nowhere.

717
00:27:13,507 --> 00:27:15,175
I need you to leave.

718
00:27:15,217 --> 00:27:16,634
Mm, so let's get it o...!

719
00:27:16,676 --> 00:27:17,970
Wait, what's happening?

720
00:27:18,011 --> 00:27:19,721
He wants to try to change.

721
00:27:19,763 --> 00:27:22,475
He wants a second chance,
and I want to give it to him.

722
00:27:22,516 --> 00:27:24,684
What...

723
00:27:24,726 --> 00:27:27,645
So you-you were just
using me to hurt him?

724
00:27:27,687 --> 00:27:29,982
Yes.

725
00:27:30,023 --> 00:27:31,233
(whispers):
Thank you.

726
00:27:31,275 --> 00:27:33,235
But what-what about me?

727
00:27:33,277 --> 00:27:35,154
What happens to me?

728
00:27:35,195 --> 00:27:38,491
I-I certainly can't
go back to you as my mother.

729
00:27:38,532 --> 00:27:41,327
After I've zipped down,
you can't expect me to zip up!

730
00:27:41,368 --> 00:27:42,536
I know that.

731
00:27:42,578 --> 00:27:44,037
But you have to leave.

732
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:46,457
Oh, no, I'm okay
with the mothering.

733
00:27:46,499 --> 00:27:48,250
I mean, he had you first,
I'm here to stay.

734
00:27:48,292 --> 00:27:50,043
It's just a little
mother/son bump in the road.

735
00:27:50,085 --> 00:27:53,005
Mother, I ain't going nowhere.

736
00:27:53,046 --> 00:27:56,216
Your hand is broken again.

737
00:27:56,258 --> 00:27:59,761
No, it's just my heart.

738
00:27:59,803 --> 00:28:02,556
Oh, it's my hand, too, actually.

739
00:28:02,598 --> 00:28:03,641
I'm sorry, Buster.

740
00:28:03,681 --> 00:28:04,808
<i>Buster was blindsided.</i>

741
00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:06,726
Ophelia!

742
00:28:06,768 --> 00:28:08,354
Tell me this.

743
00:28:08,395 --> 00:28:09,813
Who is a better lover?

744
00:28:09,855 --> 00:28:11,357
-He is.
-He is. Okay.

745
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:13,900
What about son?!

746
00:28:13,942 --> 00:28:16,820
<i>Buster was hurt.</i>

747
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:21,158
<i>And perhaps that's why</i>
<i>he availed himself</i>

748
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,952
<i>to the photos</i>
<i>of Herbert and the prostitute.</i>

749
00:28:25,579 --> 00:28:27,623
<i>And Buster, furious,</i>

750
00:28:27,665 --> 00:28:31,544
<i>decided to expose</i>
<i>Herbert himself.</i>

751
00:28:31,585 --> 00:28:32,919
(wailing)

752
00:28:32,961 --> 00:28:35,255
<i>But not before</i>
<i>using the wrong hand</i>

753
00:28:35,297 --> 00:28:37,049
<i>to punch a picture of Herbert.</i>

754
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:38,551
Stupid Bust...!

755
00:28:40,802 --> 00:28:42,388
<i>Unfortunately, it was</i>
<i>the night of Cinco,</i>

756
00:28:42,429 --> 00:28:45,516
<i>and no one was home</i>
<i>to find him.</i>

757
00:28:45,558 --> 00:28:48,268
Sad. Sad.

758
00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:49,353
(grunts)

759
00:28:53,691 --> 00:28:57,236
<i>Buster came to and rushed</i>
<i>to Cinco to share the photos</i>

760
00:28:57,277 --> 00:28:59,321
<i>with Herbert Love's</i>
<i>political enemy,</i>

761
00:28:59,363 --> 00:29:03,325
<i>when he ran into Tobias,</i>
<i>who enlisted Buster's help</i>

762
00:29:03,367 --> 00:29:07,538
<i>for a musical that was becoming</i>
<i>less fantastic every minute.</i>

763
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:09,831
But I've got to find Lucille 2,
I've got to give her pictures.

764
00:29:09,873 --> 00:29:12,125
-I don't know the songs.
-It's prerecorded.

765
00:29:12,167 --> 00:29:14,253
You're a monster,
you don't have to be any good.

766
00:29:14,294 --> 00:29:16,630
-What? -Now just go
Thing your heart out

767
00:29:16,672 --> 00:29:18,840
and don't be put off
by the freakishly large...

768
00:29:18,882 --> 00:29:20,300
What-- Oh, God!

769
00:29:20,342 --> 00:29:21,677
Okay, well, well, good.

770
00:29:21,719 --> 00:29:23,429
Then just the, uh,
the one glove will do,

771
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:25,805
and, uh... perfecto!

772
00:29:25,847 --> 00:29:26,973
(chuckles)

773
00:29:27,015 --> 00:29:28,559
<i>As fate would have it,</i>

774
00:29:28,601 --> 00:29:31,437
<i>Perfecto Telles was also</i>
<i>in need of a monster.</i>

775
00:29:31,478 --> 00:29:34,064
He's a bully.
So I want you to "bad cop" him

776
00:29:34,106 --> 00:29:35,107
for me a little, okay?

777
00:29:35,148 --> 00:29:36,442
Yeah, yeah.

778
00:29:36,483 --> 00:29:37,817
<i>And that's when</i>
<i>he heard his name.</i>

779
00:29:37,859 --> 00:29:39,653
...perfecto!

780
00:29:39,695 --> 00:29:41,947
And he's a real bully.

781
00:29:41,988 --> 00:29:44,157
He's taking money from this
innocent young high school girl.

782
00:29:44,199 --> 00:29:45,576
Ugh, I don't think
I can help you.

783
00:29:45,618 --> 00:29:47,411
-Please.
-(whispers): I don't want to be

784
00:29:47,453 --> 00:29:49,288
-a monster anymore.
-Can't you just

785
00:29:49,329 --> 00:29:52,165
show him a little thunder?
Just to scare him a bit?

786
00:29:52,207 --> 00:29:55,085
<i>And that's when Buster saw</i>
<i>the woman he'd come for.</i>

787
00:29:55,127 --> 00:29:56,629
I'm sorry.

788
00:29:56,670 --> 00:29:59,005
I have to take care
of something.

789
00:30:00,507 --> 00:30:01,759
Lucille 2.

790
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:04,136
-I've been looking for you.
-Buster!

791
00:30:04,177 --> 00:30:05,429
You look different;
something's happened to you.

792
00:30:05,471 --> 00:30:06,513
Yes.

793
00:30:06,555 --> 00:30:08,390
I've been with a black woman.

794
00:30:08,432 --> 00:30:09,849
I was talking about your hand.

795
00:30:09,891 --> 00:30:12,269
Oh. This huge thing?
Yeah, it's new.

796
00:30:12,311 --> 00:30:14,313
Of course, the week after
I got it, the six came out.

797
00:30:14,354 --> 00:30:16,064
You can play a flute
with that one.

798
00:30:16,106 --> 00:30:17,316
It comes with a flute!

799
00:30:17,357 --> 00:30:18,776
But I'm not here about that.

800
00:30:18,817 --> 00:30:20,694
I'm here about this.

801
00:30:20,736 --> 00:30:22,446
What is this?

802
00:30:22,488 --> 00:30:26,032
Oh, just pictures of Herbert
Love with a lady of the night.

803
00:30:26,074 --> 00:30:29,953
And he's gotten himself in some
pretty hot ham water this time.

804
00:30:29,995 --> 00:30:33,624
I want you to humiliate him
and win the election.

805
00:30:33,666 --> 00:30:35,459
That's my wig.

806
00:30:35,501 --> 00:30:37,919
Buster, this is priceless;
why are you giving it to me?

807
00:30:37,961 --> 00:30:39,421
Because I want to hurt him.

808
00:30:39,463 --> 00:30:41,799
I've never known you
to want to hurt anybody.

809
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:44,677
Well, I hurt my mother,
didn't I?

810
00:30:44,718 --> 00:30:46,928
I missed her trial,
and she cut me out of her life.

811
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:48,555
-But I'm over that!
-Really?

812
00:30:48,597 --> 00:30:51,099
Then you have me
to thank for that.

813
00:30:51,141 --> 00:30:53,435
-What do you mean?
-Oh, Buster,

814
00:30:53,477 --> 00:30:56,480
you think missing her trial
was an accident?

815
00:30:56,522 --> 00:30:58,440
Yes.

816
00:30:58,482 --> 00:31:00,066
Buster, I helped you with that.

817
00:31:00,108 --> 00:31:02,736
<i>Although "helped" might not be</i>

818
00:31:02,778 --> 00:31:04,321
<i>the best description</i>
<i>of what she did.</i>

819
00:31:04,363 --> 00:31:06,448
<i>In fact, she'd been</i>
<i>laying in wait for him.</i>

820
00:31:06,490 --> 00:31:08,742
Oh, Buster!

821
00:31:08,784 --> 00:31:10,869
Hello!

822
00:31:12,871 --> 00:31:15,708
<i>And once she'd gotten Buster</i>
<i>into the apartment,</i>

823
00:31:15,749 --> 00:31:17,835
<i>she eschewed the all-natural</i>
<i>juice for the kind</i>

824
00:31:17,876 --> 00:31:20,838
<i>with cartoon animals</i>
<i>and riddles on the box.</i>

825
00:31:22,548 --> 00:31:25,509
<i>The type Buster had been known</i>
<i>to have a weakness for.</i>

826
00:31:25,551 --> 00:31:27,386
Thank you.

827
00:31:27,427 --> 00:31:30,389
<i>And soon, the partying</i>
<i>was off the hook,</i>

828
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:32,683
<i>with Buster drinking</i>
<i>right out of the box.</i>

829
00:31:32,725 --> 00:31:36,395
Oh, this is just like
Mother's Day Eve!

830
00:31:36,436 --> 00:31:37,855
-(laughs)
-(playing piano off-key)

831
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:39,565
<i>Although, at one point,</i>

832
00:31:39,606 --> 00:31:41,941
<i>he did have something</i>
<i>close to an insight.</i>

833
00:31:41,983 --> 00:31:43,985
I mean, how do you miss
a sign like that?

834
00:31:44,027 --> 00:31:45,362
Oh.

835
00:31:48,031 --> 00:31:49,949
I was tinkling!

836
00:31:49,991 --> 00:31:51,117
(laughs)

837
00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:52,411
You kept me from mother?

838
00:31:52,452 --> 00:31:54,788
You sent her to prison?

839
00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:56,331
And this whole time,
I thought about

840
00:31:56,373 --> 00:31:57,541
getting back together with you.

841
00:31:57,583 --> 00:31:59,418
Well, you're a little late,
honey.

842
00:31:59,459 --> 00:32:02,295
I've been dating your father
for the past couple of weeks.

843
00:32:04,256 --> 00:32:05,591
(growls)

844
00:32:07,843 --> 00:32:09,511
<i>Buster was in a whirl.</i>

845
00:32:11,722 --> 00:32:15,183
<i>Confused and betrayed,</i>
<i>he wanted to punch something.</i>

846
00:32:15,225 --> 00:32:16,852
<i>Which is why he went here.</i>

847
00:32:16,894 --> 00:32:19,020
Hey! I need to punch something!

848
00:32:19,062 --> 00:32:21,314
Even if it is
a poor little donkey.

849
00:32:21,356 --> 00:32:23,483
<i>But it wasn't</i>
<i>that kind of donkey punch.</i>

850
00:32:23,525 --> 00:32:24,443
(gasps)

851
00:32:24,484 --> 00:32:26,486
Oh, I need some juice.

852
00:32:27,487 --> 00:32:28,988
(sighs)

853
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:32,451
Perhaps uno mas, señor,
to feed to the fishes?

854
00:32:33,243 --> 00:32:34,244
Gene Parmesan.

855
00:32:34,286 --> 00:32:36,246
This is not my real job.

856
00:32:36,288 --> 00:32:38,373
<i>And that's when Buster</i>
<i>heard his target.</i>

857
00:32:38,415 --> 00:32:40,709
HERBERT: I got to go up
and give my speech.

858
00:32:40,751 --> 00:32:42,795
You!

859
00:32:42,836 --> 00:32:45,046
Oh, hey,
it's the Blind Side Monster.

860
00:32:45,088 --> 00:32:47,090
(yells)

861
00:32:47,132 --> 00:32:49,551
<i>And so he blindsided him</i>
<i>and became one.</i>

862
00:32:49,593 --> 00:32:50,844
(shrieks)

863
00:32:50,886 --> 00:32:52,137
<i>And it was amidst</i>

864
00:32:52,178 --> 00:32:54,598
<i>the rampaging of the blowback</i>

865
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:56,892
<i>that a juiced-up Buster</i>
<i>noticed something horrifying.</i>

866
00:32:56,934 --> 00:32:58,977
(firecrackers popping,
whistling)

867
00:32:59,018 --> 00:33:01,605
(screaming)

868
00:33:01,647 --> 00:33:03,565
(gasps)

869
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:06,568
(sobbing)

870
00:33:06,610 --> 00:33:08,695
(panting)

871
00:33:12,950 --> 00:33:14,576
Oh, no.

872
00:33:14,618 --> 00:33:17,412
I'm in the movie.

873
00:33:17,454 --> 00:33:19,581
(whimpers):
Oh, no.

874
00:33:23,042 --> 00:33:24,920
(knocking)

875
00:33:24,962 --> 00:33:26,880
<i>Buster tries</i>
<i>to cover his tracks.</i>

876
00:33:26,922 --> 00:33:27,798
Hey, nephew!

877
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:29,090
-(screams)
-New hand.

878
00:33:29,132 --> 00:33:30,717
It's cool. That's cool.

879
00:33:30,759 --> 00:33:34,137
You know that super-duper
privacy software you have?

880
00:33:34,179 --> 00:33:36,222
Does that work
on security cameras?

881
00:33:36,264 --> 00:33:37,182
Of course, yeah.

882
00:33:37,223 --> 00:33:38,517
Works on everything.

883
00:33:38,558 --> 00:33:39,601
May I borrow it?

884
00:33:39,643 --> 00:33:41,645
One second.

885
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:44,940
Here you go, Uncle Buster.
I put it on

886
00:33:44,982 --> 00:33:46,692
a hard drive for you.
Just please be careful with it.

887
00:33:46,733 --> 00:33:48,527
(laughs):
Of course, of course.

888
00:33:48,568 --> 00:33:49,903
(crunching)

889
00:33:49,945 --> 00:33:51,530
(whimpers softly)

890
00:33:51,571 --> 00:33:54,032
Have you got one with a case?

891
00:33:54,073 --> 00:33:55,492
BUSTER:
Hey, Carl.

892
00:33:55,534 --> 00:33:56,702
Buster!

893
00:33:56,743 --> 00:33:58,411
<i>And Buster visits</i>

894
00:33:58,453 --> 00:34:01,247
<i>a Balboa Towers guard</i>
<i>he'd known for many years</i>

895
00:34:01,289 --> 00:34:02,875
<i>for an impromptu lesson</i>

896
00:34:02,916 --> 00:34:06,252
<i>on how their footage</i>
<i>is gathered and stored.</i>

897
00:34:06,294 --> 00:34:07,671
May I use your phone?

898
00:34:07,713 --> 00:34:10,173
<i>But when Carl steps away,</i>

899
00:34:10,215 --> 00:34:11,758
<i>Buster goes into action</i>

900
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:14,761
<i>and attempts</i>
<i>to Fakeblock the footage.</i>

901
00:34:14,803 --> 00:34:16,346
-(steady ticking)
-Oh.

902
00:34:16,388 --> 00:34:19,516
Sounds like it's working.

903
00:34:19,558 --> 00:34:20,517
(sighs)

904
00:34:20,559 --> 00:34:22,769
(grunting rhythmically)

905
00:34:22,811 --> 00:34:24,771
(steady ticking continues)

906
00:34:29,651 --> 00:34:30,986
(gasps)

907
00:34:31,028 --> 00:34:31,945
Buster.

908
00:34:31,987 --> 00:34:33,112
Hey, Carl.

909
00:34:33,154 --> 00:34:34,948
-Everything okay?
-Mm-hmm.

910
00:34:34,990 --> 00:34:36,115
Bye, Carl.

911
00:34:36,157 --> 00:34:37,826
-Bye-bye, Buster.
-Okay.

912
00:34:43,916 --> 00:34:46,084
(grunting rhythmically
over video)

913
00:34:48,837 --> 00:34:51,464
What she did to this boy.
