1
00:00:01,126 --> 00:00:03,128
[narrator] 
IT'S ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT.

2
00:00:06,172 --> 00:00:08,549
MICHAEL WAS 
PREPARING HIS SISTER...

3
00:00:08,549 --> 00:00:09,884
FOR HER UPCOMING DEPOSITION

4
00:00:09,884 --> 00:00:11,261
IN THE CASE AGAINST 
THEIR FATHER.

5
00:00:11,261 --> 00:00:13,054
- IF THEY SAY,

6
00:00:13,054 --> 00:00:15,348
"DID YOU KNOW OF ANY FINANCIAL 
IMPROPRIETIES?" YOU'LL--

7
00:00:15,348 --> 00:00:17,392
- UNBUTTON MY SHIRT A BIT 
AND GIVE 'EM THIS LOOK.

8
00:00:19,102 --> 00:00:20,603
- NOT REALLY SURE WHAT 
YOU'RE GOIN' FOR.

9
00:00:20,603 --> 00:00:22,397
- I DRANK A LOT LAST NIGHT.

10
00:00:22,397 --> 00:00:24,357
- WHY WERE YOU DRINKING?

11
00:00:24,357 --> 00:00:27,860
- IF I LOOK LIKE A MAN WHO MADE 
LOVE TO HIS WIFE LAST NIGHT,

12
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:31,531
IT'S BECAUSE I ALMOST DID. 
- THAT'S WHY.

13
00:00:31,531 --> 00:00:32,698
[narrator] 
BUT TOBIAS HAD

14
00:00:32,698 --> 00:00:34,700
A LOW TOLERANCE FOR ALCOHOL.

15
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:37,745
- [speech slurred] 
OH, YOU LOOK VERY HANDS--

16
00:00:37,745 --> 00:00:40,206
- SO YOU JUST 
FINISHED OFF THE BOTTLE?

17
00:00:40,206 --> 00:00:42,208
- I HAD TO. IT'S VODKA. 
IT GOES BAD ONCE IT'S OPENED.

18
00:00:42,208 --> 00:00:44,710
- I THINK THAT'S ANOTHER 
ONE OF MOM'S LITTLE FIBS.

19
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:46,212
YOU KNOW, LIKE,

20
00:00:46,212 --> 00:00:47,713
"I'LL SACRIFICE ANYTHING 
FOR MY CHILDREN."

21
00:00:47,713 --> 00:00:49,257
- SPEAKING OF MOM, 
SHE REALLY DOESN'T WANT ME

22
00:00:49,257 --> 00:00:51,301
TO DO THIS DEPOSITION.

23
00:00:51,301 --> 00:00:53,844
- YOU HAVE TO, LINDSAY. SORRY. 
YOU'VE BEEN SUBPOENAED.

24
00:00:53,844 --> 00:00:55,805
- I'M AFRAID I MIGHT NOT BE ABLE 
TO BE DEPOSED EITHER.

25
00:00:55,805 --> 00:00:57,223
I GOT A CALL OUT OF THE BLUE

26
00:00:57,223 --> 00:00:59,016
FOR A CHANCE TO PLAY 
A VERY IMPORTANT PART...

27
00:00:59,016 --> 00:01:02,019
IN... THE PROSECUTION.

28
00:01:02,019 --> 00:01:03,313
- THE PROSECUTION CALLED YOU?

29
00:01:03,313 --> 00:01:05,398
- I ASSUME IT'S 
A CBS PROCEDURAL.

30
00:01:05,398 --> 00:01:07,192
THEY DIDN'T SEND SIDES, 
SO I THOUGHT I'D TROT OUT

31
00:01:07,192 --> 00:01:09,485
A VAGINA MONOLOGUE OR SOMETHING.

32
00:01:09,485 --> 00:01:11,654
THEY DID ASK FOR OLD PHOTOS 
AND DOCUMENTS,

33
00:01:11,654 --> 00:01:14,115
SO I WENT AND GOT THESE 
OUT OF THE SECRET ROOM-- OOP.

34
00:01:14,115 --> 00:01:16,201
- "THE PROSECUTION" 
IS NOT A TV SHOW.

35
00:01:16,201 --> 00:01:17,827
IT'S CLEARLY SOMEBODY 
IN THE D.A.'S OFFICE

36
00:01:17,827 --> 00:01:19,454
TRYING TO GET YOU TO FLIP.

37
00:01:19,454 --> 00:01:22,873
THESE GUYS WILL BEND THE LAW 
TO ENFORCE THE LAW.

38
00:01:22,873 --> 00:01:25,168
- TELL ME THAT'S NOT 
A CBS FRANCHISE.

39
00:01:25,168 --> 00:01:26,586
- I'M SERIOUS.

40
00:01:26,586 --> 00:01:28,129
WHY ELSE WOULD THEY WANT 
ALL THESE DOCUMENTS?

41
00:01:28,129 --> 00:01:29,839
- FOR SET DRESSING, 
SILLY.

42
00:01:29,839 --> 00:01:32,383
THOSE HOLLYWOOD SHOWS 
ARE SO INCREDIBLY DETAILED.

43
00:01:32,383 --> 00:01:34,135
- YOU'RE GONNA TELL THEM 
YOU'RE NOT INTERESTED.

44
00:01:34,135 --> 00:01:35,761
WE ALL HAVE TO BE CAREFUL.

45
00:01:35,761 --> 00:01:37,555
THE PROSECUTION'S GONNA BE 
COMING AFTER ALL OF US.

46
00:01:37,555 --> 00:01:40,057
- INCLUDING ME? 
- YOU DON'T HAVE ANY SECRETS.

47
00:01:40,057 --> 00:01:41,267
- OH, YEAH. 
[laughs]

48
00:01:41,267 --> 00:01:43,478
YEAH. NO, I--

49
00:01:43,478 --> 00:01:45,605
UM, HEY, UH, 
SPEAKING OF THAT.

50
00:01:45,605 --> 00:01:47,690
IT'S ACTUALLY 
HER BIRTHDAY SOON,

51
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:49,692
SO I THOUGHT WE COULD ALL 
DO SOMETHING FOR HER.

52
00:01:49,692 --> 00:01:53,070
- WHOSE BIRTHDAY? 
- MAEBY'S.

53
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:54,697
I WAS CHANGING THE SUBJECT.

54
00:01:54,697 --> 00:01:57,367
WE-- NO. YEAH, WE WEREN'T 
TALKING ABOUT MAEBY.

55
00:01:57,367 --> 00:01:58,743
BUT SHE'S BEEN FEELING

56
00:01:58,743 --> 00:02:00,536
KIND OF LEFT OUT OF 
THE FAMILY LATELY,

57
00:02:00,536 --> 00:02:02,997
AND I THOUGHT MAYBE WE COULD 
THROW HER A SURPRISE PARTY.

58
00:02:02,997 --> 00:02:04,332
[narrator] 
ACTUALLY, HE'D ALREADY

59
00:02:04,332 --> 00:02:05,375
TOLD HER ABOUT IT.

60
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:07,252
- I JUST POURED MOM INTO BED.

61
00:02:07,252 --> 00:02:08,836
WOULD IT KILL HER 
TO LET SOME VODKA GO BAD?

62
00:02:08,836 --> 00:02:10,380
- NO. VODKA DOESN'T--

63
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:11,714
- IT'S MY BIRTHDAY IN A WEEK,

64
00:02:11,714 --> 00:02:13,133
AND I BET YOU THEY DON'T 
EVEN KNOW.

65
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:16,136
THEY FORGET EVERY YEAR. 
I SHOULD JUST MOVE OUT.

66
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:18,971
- BUT THEY'RE PLANNING 
A SURPRISE PARTY FOR YOU.

67
00:02:18,971 --> 00:02:21,391
THEY WOULDN'T FORGET 
YOUR 16th BIRTHDAY.

68
00:02:21,391 --> 00:02:24,227
- OH, MY GOSH. 
OUR LITTLE GIRL'S TURNING 14.

69
00:02:24,227 --> 00:02:25,686
- SIXTEEN ACTUALLY.

70
00:02:25,686 --> 00:02:28,063
- WELL, I AM OFF TO BUY 
THE PERFECT PRESENT.

71
00:02:28,063 --> 00:02:29,399
MAYBE SHE'D LIKE 
A SUIT LIKE THIS.

72
00:02:29,399 --> 00:02:31,734
[narrator] 
THAT IS HER SUIT.

73
00:02:31,734 --> 00:02:33,486
- THEY PROBABLY DON'T MAKE IT 
IN A WOMAN'S STYLE.

74
00:02:33,486 --> 00:02:35,613
[narrator] 
THEY ONLY MAKE IT IN A WOMAN'S.

75
00:02:35,613 --> 00:02:37,698
- WELL, I'M OFF, MY LOVE.

76
00:02:37,698 --> 00:02:39,033
- YOU SEE? SOMETIMES, 
SHAME CAN BE FUN.

77
00:02:39,033 --> 00:02:40,368
- SHAME?

78
00:02:40,368 --> 00:02:43,078
- SECRETS. YOU-- 
YOU SAID "SHAME."

79
00:02:43,078 --> 00:02:45,706
HE SAID "SHAME."

80
00:02:45,706 --> 00:02:47,833
- HOW DOES HE KNOW ABOUT HER? 
- HMM?

81
00:02:47,833 --> 00:02:50,628
- DIDN'T HE JUST SAY GOB 
SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF HIMSELF?

82
00:02:50,628 --> 00:02:52,046
- NO, BUT GIVE IT A WHILE.

83
00:02:52,046 --> 00:02:53,381
SOMEBODY WILL. 
WHAT'S ALL THAT FOR?

84
00:02:53,381 --> 00:02:54,549
- IT'S FOR MY 
OUT-OF-TOWN ACT.

85
00:02:54,549 --> 00:02:57,051
- OUT OF TOWN, GOB?

86
00:02:57,051 --> 00:02:58,886
THE PROSECUTION IS WATCHING 
EVERY MOVE WE MAKE.

87
00:02:58,886 --> 00:03:00,721
- I'M JUST GOING TO IRAQ.

88
00:03:00,721 --> 00:03:02,682
- NO, YOU'RE NOT. 
- YES, I AM.

89
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:04,475
- NO, YOU'RE NOT.

90
00:03:04,475 --> 00:03:06,477
DAD IS UP ON TREASON CHARGES 
FOR BUILDING HOMES IN IRAQ.

91
00:03:06,477 --> 00:03:07,937
- IT'S A U.S.O. TOUR. 
- YOU'RE NOT GOING.

92
00:03:07,937 --> 00:03:09,397
- I'M DOING MY 
CHRISTIAN MAGIC ACT

93
00:03:09,397 --> 00:03:11,065
MY RELIGION GIRLFRIEND 
HELPED ME WORK OUT.

94
00:03:11,065 --> 00:03:12,400
I DRESS UP LIKE JESUS,

95
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,776
WALK ON WATER, 
WHICH YOU'VE SEEN.

96
00:03:13,776 --> 00:03:15,069
I'M GONNA DO 
THE WINE INTO WATER.

97
00:03:15,069 --> 00:03:16,779
- IT'S WATER INTO WINE.

98
00:03:16,779 --> 00:03:18,739
- THEN I'VE JUST EMPTIED OUT 
ALL YOUR WINE BOTTLES...

99
00:03:18,739 --> 00:03:21,033
AND FILLED THEM 
WITH FAKE STUFF FOR NOTHING.

100
00:03:21,033 --> 00:03:23,286
- GREAT, HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO 
HAVE SEX WITH MY HUSBAND NOW?

101
00:03:23,286 --> 00:03:26,747
- GOB, WE GOT THE DEPOSITIONS. 
YOU'RE NOT GOIN' TO IRAQ.

102
00:03:26,747 --> 00:03:28,624
- YOU'RE JUST JEALOUS 
THAT I AM THE SON...

103
00:03:28,624 --> 00:03:32,295
THAT THE FATHER HAS ASKED TO DO 
HIS WORK IN THE HOLY LAND.

104
00:03:32,295 --> 00:03:33,921
- SO DAD IS BEHIND THIS.

105
00:03:33,921 --> 00:03:36,216
- AND HE WON'T BUMP ME UP 
TO BUSINESS CLASS.

106
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:37,717
[narrator] 
LATER THAT DAY,

107
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:40,678
TOBIAS MET WITH THE PROSECUTOR, 
WAYNE JARVIS.

108
00:03:40,678 --> 00:03:45,600
- ...A FLOWER IN MY GARDEN, 
A MYSTERY IN MY PANTIES.

109
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,685
- THIS IS NOT AN AUDITION 
FOR A CBS SHOW.

110
00:03:47,685 --> 00:03:49,144
- I WAS JUST LOOKING 
FOR SOME FEEDBACK.

111
00:03:49,144 --> 00:03:51,689
- IT WAS A LITTLE CONTRIVED.

112
00:03:51,689 --> 00:03:54,275
NOW, WE THINK WE CAN 
OFFER YOU A GOOD DEAL...

113
00:03:54,275 --> 00:03:57,570
IF YOU PROVIDE EVIDENCE THAT 
PUTS GEORGE BLUTH BEHIND BARS.

114
00:03:57,570 --> 00:03:59,280
- I'LL TELL YOU WHAT ELSE 
IS CONTRIVED-- THE ODDS

115
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,073
I WOULD TURN ON MY FAMILY...

116
00:04:01,073 --> 00:04:03,243
FOR SOMEBODY WHO IS NOT 
ONLY TRYING TO HURT THEM...

117
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:04,952
BUT WHO WOULDN'T KNOW 
GOOD ACTING IF IT MARCHED

118
00:04:04,952 --> 00:04:06,412
THROUGH THAT DOOR...

119
00:04:06,412 --> 00:04:08,456
AND GAVE THEM HEAD SHOTS 
AND DECORATIVE SOAPS.

120
00:04:08,456 --> 00:04:09,874
[narrator] 
AND AS TOBIAS WAITED

121
00:04:09,874 --> 00:04:11,709
FOR THE ELEVATOR,

122
00:04:11,709 --> 00:04:14,712
HE NOTICED AN INTERESTING FLYER 
PROMISING THE PERFECT GIFT...

123
00:04:14,712 --> 00:04:17,507
FOR THE DAUGHTER WHO DIDN'T 
FEEL PART OF THE FAMILY.

124
00:04:17,507 --> 00:04:18,758
- HE TOOK THE BAIT.

125
00:04:18,758 --> 00:04:20,843
- HE'S A CLASSIC 
SCRAPBOOKER.

126
00:04:20,843 --> 00:04:23,346
- RIGHT DOWN 
TO THE WOMAN'S SUIT.

127
00:04:23,346 --> 00:04:24,389
[narrator] 
MICHAEL WENT

128
00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:25,431
TO CONFRONT HIS FATHER

129
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:27,099
ABOUT GOB'S TRIP TO IRAQ.

130
00:04:27,099 --> 00:04:28,934
- EVERYONE KNOWS YOU BUILT 
HOMES FOR SADDAM HUSSEIN.

131
00:04:28,934 --> 00:04:30,353
TELL ME WHAT'S GOING ON.

132
00:04:30,353 --> 00:04:33,022
- FOR THE MILLIONTH TIME, 
I WAS A PATSY.

133
00:04:33,022 --> 00:04:35,232
I GOTTA FIND A LOOPHOLE 
TO GET OUT OF THIS,

134
00:04:35,232 --> 00:04:39,737
BUT BUSTER TOOK COMA 
AND YOUR MOTHER TOOK REHAB.

135
00:04:39,737 --> 00:04:41,906
- HEY. 
YOU GOIN' TO REHAB AGAIN?

136
00:04:41,906 --> 00:04:45,242
- I'M BRINGING LINDSAY. 
I'M WORRIED ABOUT HER.

137
00:04:45,242 --> 00:04:47,244
- DID YOU GET THE CORKSCREW?

138
00:04:47,244 --> 00:04:49,580
- I SEE THERE'S GONNA BE WINE 
AT THE REHAB, HUH?

139
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:52,500
- WINE ONLY TURNS INTO ALCOHOL 
IF YOU LET IT SIT.

140
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:55,085
- HOW DO YOU COME UP 
WITH THESE?

141
00:04:55,085 --> 00:04:57,338
I'LL MEET WITH THE PROSECUTOR, 
ASK FOR A POSTPONEMENT.

142
00:04:57,338 --> 00:04:58,923
BUT I'M GONNA HAVE 
TO GO ON THE RECORD ABOUT

143
00:04:58,923 --> 00:05:00,883
WHY YOU TWO AREN'T THERE.

144
00:05:00,883 --> 00:05:02,802
IF YOU MAKE A LIAR OUT OF ME, 
WE'RE GONNA BE IN BIG TROUBLE.

145
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:04,554
- THIS CONSTANT BICKERING 
IS GONNA PUT ME IN A COMA.

146
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:06,472
- NICE TRY, DAD.

147
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:07,765
[narrator] 
BUSTER WAS FINDING

148
00:05:07,765 --> 00:05:09,934
HIS FAKE COMA HARD TO SUSTAIN.

149
00:05:09,934 --> 00:05:11,185
- IT TAKES A LOT OF COURAGE

150
00:05:11,185 --> 00:05:13,313
TO ENDURE WHAT THEY 
PUT YOU THROUGH,

151
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:15,731
ESPECIALLY SINCE YOUR MOTHER 
SAW THAT WEB SITE.

152
00:05:15,731 --> 00:05:17,525
[narrator] 
BUSTER WAS NOT ONLY PROVIDING

153
00:05:17,525 --> 00:05:18,651
MEDICAL STUDENTS...

154
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:20,445
A LIVE BODY TO LEARN ON--

155
00:05:20,445 --> 00:05:23,238
- THAT'S OKAY. TRY AGAIN. 
NO. THAT'S A TENDON.

156
00:05:23,238 --> 00:05:25,074
HE'D BE SCREAMING RIGHT NOW. 
THAT'S OKAY. TRY AGAIN.

157
00:05:25,074 --> 00:05:26,241
- [low moaning]

158
00:05:26,241 --> 00:05:27,993
[narrator] 
HE'D ALSO SERVED

159
00:05:27,993 --> 00:05:30,079
AS A HUMAN CANVAS 
FOR ASPIRING BEAUTICIANS.

160
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:31,331
- THAT'S OKAY.

161
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:32,748
YOU PUT TOO MUCH 
COLLAGEN IN THERE.

162
00:05:32,748 --> 00:05:34,166
NO, NO. TRY IT AGAIN.

163
00:05:34,166 --> 00:05:35,710
[narrator] 
AND A MUCH-NEEDED SET OF TEETH

164
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:36,919
FOR A DENTAL PROGRAM...

165
00:05:36,919 --> 00:05:38,295
[drill buzzing]

166
00:05:38,295 --> 00:05:40,297
DESIGNED TO ENCOURAGE 
AT-RISK YOUTH.

167
00:05:40,297 --> 00:05:43,634
- THAT'S OKAY, TURF. 
NO. TRY AGAIN.

168
00:05:43,634 --> 00:05:45,302
[Buster gasping]

169
00:05:45,302 --> 00:05:47,137
YOU'VE GOT YOUR FOREARM 
ON THIS WINDPIPE, DOG BONE.

170
00:05:47,137 --> 00:05:48,347
[narrator] 
IT REALLY WAS AMAZING

171
00:05:48,347 --> 00:05:49,474
FOR THEIR SELF-ESTEEM.

172
00:05:49,474 --> 00:05:51,266
- I DID IT.

173
00:05:51,266 --> 00:05:53,143
[narrator] 
EVEN BUSTER WAS MOVED.

174
00:05:53,143 --> 00:05:55,813
BUT HE ENDURED IT ALL 
FOR ADELAIDE.

175
00:05:55,813 --> 00:05:57,815
- I LOVE YOU, BUSTER.

176
00:05:57,815 --> 00:05:58,983
WHAT I WOULD GIVE 
TO HEAR YOU SAY

177
00:05:58,983 --> 00:06:00,776
YOU LOVE ME TOO--

178
00:06:00,776 --> 00:06:03,821
EVEN IF IT MEANT YOU'D BEEN 
FAKING THIS WHOLE TIME.

179
00:06:03,821 --> 00:06:07,157
SPEAK TO ME. 
SAY ANYTHING, MY LOVE.

180
00:06:07,157 --> 00:06:09,494
- ANYTHING? 
- [exclaims]

181
00:06:09,494 --> 00:06:11,328
- [yelps] 
- FAKER!

182
00:06:11,328 --> 00:06:12,913
- I WASN'T FAKING 
MY LOVE FOR YOU.

183
00:06:12,913 --> 00:06:15,165
I DIDN'T WANT TO TESTIFY 
AT MY DAD'S TRIAL.

184
00:06:15,165 --> 00:06:17,668
- WELL, YOU'RE A COWARD. 
- NO!

185
00:06:17,668 --> 00:06:20,004
- ADELAIDE, HOW COULD YOU 
LET THIS HAPPEN AGAIN?

186
00:06:20,004 --> 00:06:23,549
I WISH YOU'D COME TO, 
OR DON'T YOU CARE ABOUT ME?

187
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:27,177
- OF COURSE I CARE ABOUT YOU. 
- YOU FAKER!

188
00:06:27,177 --> 00:06:29,764
HOW COULD I LET THIS 
HAPPEN TO ME AGAIN?

189
00:06:29,764 --> 00:06:33,726
TAKE A SINGLE STEP 
TO SHOW ME YOUR LOVE, GARY.

190
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:35,770
- AW! 
FAKER!

191
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:37,730
[narrator] 
SHE WAS WRONG ON THAT ONE.

192
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:39,857
IT WAS LOVE 
THAT MADE GARY TAKE THAT STEP.

193
00:06:39,857 --> 00:06:43,027
- WHO EVER SAID VEGETABLES 
WERE GOOD FOR YOUR HEART?

194
00:06:43,027 --> 00:06:44,069
- [crying]

195
00:06:44,069 --> 00:06:45,446
NO, NO. 
NO, PLEASE.

196
00:06:45,446 --> 00:06:46,572
[narrator] 
OF COURSE, HE HADN'T

197
00:06:46,572 --> 00:06:47,657
USED HIS LEGS IN THREE WEEKS.

198
00:06:47,657 --> 00:06:49,575
[yelps]

199
00:06:49,575 --> 00:06:51,619
AND MICHAEL MET 
WITH WAYNE JARVIS.

200
00:06:51,619 --> 00:06:54,079
- I APOLOGIZE FOR THE REST 
OF MY FAMILY NOT BEING HERE.

201
00:06:54,079 --> 00:06:55,456
THEY WANTED TO TESTIFY,

202
00:06:55,456 --> 00:06:57,416
BUT THEY ALL HAVE 
PERFECTLY LEGAL EXCUSES.

203
00:06:57,416 --> 00:07:00,461
AND I CAN ASSURE YOU 
THAT NO ONE IS HIDING.

204
00:07:00,461 --> 00:07:02,046
- MICHAEL, YOUR MOTHER 
AND YOUR SISTER ARE NOT

205
00:07:02,046 --> 00:07:03,589
IN A REHAB CENTER.

206
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:05,550
- WHERE ARE THEY REALLY? 
- WE DON'T KNOW.

207
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:06,801
BUT WE DO KNOW 
THE TWO PEOPLE WHO

208
00:07:06,801 --> 00:07:08,469
CHECKED INTO SHADY PINES...

209
00:07:08,469 --> 00:07:10,179
UNDER THE NAMES LUCILLE BLUTH 
AND LINDSAY FUNKE

210
00:07:10,179 --> 00:07:12,389
ARE NOT YOUR RELATIVES.

211
00:07:12,389 --> 00:07:14,224
ALSO, FOR SOMEONE IN A COMA,

212
00:07:14,224 --> 00:07:15,810
YOUR BROTHER BUSTER HAS MADE

213
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:18,479
AN IMPRESSIVE 15 PHONE CALLS 
TO RADIO STATIONS...

214
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:19,939
ALTERNATELY REQUESTING

215
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:21,607
"I WILL SURVIVE" AND-- 
WHAT WAS THE OTHER ONE?

216
00:07:21,607 --> 00:07:23,108
- [heavy accent] 
"SHE'S OUT OF MY LIFE."

217
00:07:23,108 --> 00:07:24,735
- "SHE'S OUT OF MY LIFE."

218
00:07:24,735 --> 00:07:27,237
AS FOR YOUR BROTHER GOB 
IN THE U.S.O.--

219
00:07:27,237 --> 00:07:28,405
- DON'T TELL ME 
HE'S NOT IN IRAQ?

220
00:07:28,405 --> 00:07:30,115
- NO, HE'S THERE.

221
00:07:30,115 --> 00:07:32,743
IN FACT, MICHAEL, 
HE'S ON THE NEWS-- RIGHT NOW.

222
00:07:32,743 --> 00:07:34,579
[speaking Japanese]

223
00:07:34,579 --> 00:07:37,748
- ARE BEES BETTER AT 
SNIFFING OUT DRUGS THAN DOGS?

224
00:07:37,748 --> 00:07:40,250
- I'M SURE IT'S COMING RIGHT UP. 
THEY'VE BEEN PLAYING IT ALL DAY.

225
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:41,502
[woman on tv] 
AND THEY DELIVER

226
00:07:41,502 --> 00:07:43,253
INSULIN RIGHT TO MY DOOR.

227
00:07:43,253 --> 00:07:45,089
- I'M SURE IT'S RIGHT AFTER 
THIS SERIES OF ADS.

228
00:07:45,089 --> 00:07:47,758
IT'S, LIKE, EVERY TIME 
YOU TURN ON THE TV, IT'S THERE.

229
00:07:47,758 --> 00:07:50,344
- WHY DON'T WE JUST GO ONLINE? 
- COOL YOUR JAPANESE JETS.

230
00:07:50,344 --> 00:07:52,221
- AN INSURGENT IN IRAQ FROM 
ORANGE COUNTY, CALIFORNIA?

231
00:07:52,221 --> 00:07:54,181
- IT'S ON.

232
00:07:54,181 --> 00:07:56,141
- WHY HE'S BEING HELD IN JAIL 
AND WHY HE WON'T BE COMING HOME

233
00:07:56,141 --> 00:07:57,977
ANYTIME SOON.

234
00:07:57,977 --> 00:07:59,645
- AND IMAGINE THE IMPACT

235
00:07:59,645 --> 00:08:01,939
IF THAT HAD COME ON RIGHT 
WHEN WE TURNED ON THE TV.

236
00:08:09,071 --> 00:08:10,698
[narrator] 
MICHAEL HAD BEEN CALLED TO SIGN

237
00:08:10,698 --> 00:08:12,950
HIS BROTHER OUT OF THE HOSPITAL.

238
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:14,451
- YOU CAN STOP PRETENDING 
TO BE IN A COMA.

239
00:08:14,451 --> 00:08:16,328
WE HEARD 
YOUR REQUESTS ON THE WAY OVER.

240
00:08:16,328 --> 00:08:19,373
- I'M NOT FAKING IT, MICHAEL. 
I REALLY AM THIS EXPRESSIONLESS.

241
00:08:19,373 --> 00:08:21,416
MY LOVE THINKS I'M A COWARD...

242
00:08:21,416 --> 00:08:23,377
JUST BECAUSE I WAS USING 
PRECIOUS HOSPITAL RESOURCES

243
00:08:23,377 --> 00:08:25,337
TO AVOID MY LEGAL OBLIGATION.

244
00:08:25,337 --> 00:08:27,965
- THAT DOES SAY COWARD. 
WE'VE GOT BIGGER PROBLEMS.

245
00:08:27,965 --> 00:08:29,133
GOB IS LOCKED IN A PRISON 
IN IRAQ.

246
00:08:29,133 --> 00:08:30,593
- WHAT?

247
00:08:30,593 --> 00:08:31,927
- SO HE'S ACTUALLY 
IN AN IRAQI PRISON?

248
00:08:31,927 --> 00:08:33,721
- NO. 
IT'S U.S. RUN.

249
00:08:33,721 --> 00:08:35,139
- OH.

250
00:08:35,139 --> 00:08:36,599
- GOD KNOWS WHAT 
THEY'RE DOING TO HIM.

251
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:38,142
MOM AND LINDSAY 
ARE PRETENDING TO BE IN REHAB.

252
00:08:38,142 --> 00:08:39,644
I CAN'T GET AHOLD OF DAD,

253
00:08:39,644 --> 00:08:43,105
AND I HAVE TO FLY TO IRAQ 
MYSELF TO GET GOB.

254
00:08:43,105 --> 00:08:45,941
- DO YOU HAVE TO GO BY YOURSELF? 
- LET ME GO WITH YOU.

255
00:08:45,941 --> 00:08:49,904
I WAS TRAINED BY ARMY. 
I SPEAK THE LANGUAGE.

256
00:08:49,904 --> 00:08:52,114
- YOU SPEAK ARABIC? 
- [throaty vocalization]

257
00:08:52,114 --> 00:08:53,407
- WHAT'S THAT MEAN?

258
00:08:53,407 --> 00:08:54,825
- I WAS JUST CLEARING 
MY THROAT.

259
00:08:54,825 --> 00:08:56,619
BUT I THINK IT ACTUALLY 
DOES MEAN "LAUNDRY."

260
00:08:56,619 --> 00:08:57,953
LIKE A CHILD'S LAUNDRY.

261
00:08:57,953 --> 00:08:59,622
WE DON'T REALLY 
HAVE A WORD FOR IT.

262
00:08:59,622 --> 00:09:02,667
BUT THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT I NEED 
TO PROVE TO MY LOVE...

263
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:05,127
THAT I AM A HERO, 
NOT A COWARD.

264
00:09:05,127 --> 00:09:06,503
I HAVE MY UNIFORM HERE.

265
00:09:06,503 --> 00:09:09,757
MOTHER BROUGHT IT 
FOR THE PHOTO SHOOT.

266
00:09:09,757 --> 00:09:11,759
- WOULD YOU BE BACK IN TIME 
FOR MAEBY'S SURPRISE PARTY?

267
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:13,093
- PROBABLY NOT.

268
00:09:13,093 --> 00:09:14,595
WE'LL DO SOMETHING 
WHEN I GET BACK.

269
00:09:14,595 --> 00:09:15,930
WHY DON'T YOU DRIVE 
THE STAIR CAR HOME.

270
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:17,723
BUSTER AND I 
WILL LEAVE FROM HERE.

271
00:09:17,723 --> 00:09:20,893
- BE CAREFUL. 
- HEY. WHO'S TOUGHER THAN US?

272
00:09:22,477 --> 00:09:24,814
[whimpers]

273
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:26,816
- CLOSE ONE.

274
00:09:26,816 --> 00:09:28,400
[murmurs]

275
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,484
[narrator] 
THE DEPOSITIONS

276
00:09:29,484 --> 00:09:30,653
HAD BEEN DELAYED,

277
00:09:30,653 --> 00:09:32,196
BUT THE PROSECUTION WAS ABOUT

278
00:09:32,196 --> 00:09:34,740
TO GET A LORD &amp; TAYLOR 
BAG FULL OF EVIDENCE.

279
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:37,451
- WE SUPPLY THE GLITTER, 
THE GLUE, THE CREPE PAPER...

280
00:09:37,451 --> 00:09:39,119
AND THE READY-MADE 
TEMPLATE PAGES FOR YOU TO

281
00:09:39,119 --> 00:09:41,914
DECORATE AND FILL OUT WITH--

282
00:09:41,914 --> 00:09:46,335
MY FAVORITE BIRTHDAY, 
FOREIGN BANK STATEMENTS,

283
00:09:46,335 --> 00:09:49,504
AND, OF COURSE-- SHH-- 
FAMILY SECRETS.

284
00:09:49,504 --> 00:09:51,757
[narrator] 
THE SCRAPBOOKING STING HAD

285
00:09:51,757 --> 00:09:53,258
HELPED THE D.A. 
GATHER EVIDENCE...

286
00:09:53,258 --> 00:09:55,595
AGAINST PEOPLE AS DIVERSE 
AS KEN LAY,

287
00:09:57,429 --> 00:09:59,389
OLIVER NORTH,

288
00:10:00,641 --> 00:10:03,518
BUT, IRONICALLY, 
NOT MARTHA STEWART.

289
00:10:03,518 --> 00:10:06,521
- SO DIG UP WHATEVER YOU CAN, 
AND REMEMBER,

290
00:10:06,521 --> 00:10:09,483
PHOTOCOPIES ARE NOT 
ADMISSIBLE AS MEMORIES.

291
00:10:09,483 --> 00:10:11,026
- SIR, I'M GONNA HAVE 
TO GO TO OUR OLD FAMILY

292
00:10:11,026 --> 00:10:13,153
STORAGE UNIT IN RESEDA.

293
00:10:13,153 --> 00:10:14,905
- NO PROBLEM.

294
00:10:14,905 --> 00:10:16,907
WE CAN ARRANGE FOR A HELICOPTER 
TO TAKE YOU THERE RIGHT NOW.

295
00:10:16,907 --> 00:10:18,158
- WOW!

296
00:10:18,158 --> 00:10:19,576
THIS IS THE BEST 
FREE SCRAPBOOKING CLASS

297
00:10:19,576 --> 00:10:21,036
I'VE EVER TAKEN.

298
00:10:21,036 --> 00:10:22,537
[narrator] 
MEANWHILE, LINDSAY AND LUCILLE

299
00:10:22,537 --> 00:10:24,123
WERE AT A SPA IN THE DESERT,

300
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:26,667
AVOIDING BOTH REHAB 
AND THEIR DEPOSITIONS.

301
00:10:26,667 --> 00:10:30,212
- FOUR SAUNAS, THREE STEAM 
BATHS, OLYMPIC-SIZED POOL,

302
00:10:30,212 --> 00:10:32,882
AND YOU'RE TELLING ME 
THERE'S NO ALCOHOL?

303
00:10:32,882 --> 00:10:35,885
WHAT THE HELL ARE WE SUPPOSED 
TO DO FOR TWO DAYS?

304
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:37,427
- I COULD TAKE THE TOP 
OFF THIS GRAPE JUICE,

305
00:10:37,427 --> 00:10:39,429
AND MAYBE BY MORNING--

306
00:10:39,429 --> 00:10:41,556
- OH, FOR GOD'S SAKE, LINDSAY! 
GROW UP! YOU'RE 40 YEARS OLD.

307
00:10:41,556 --> 00:10:43,183
- THIRTY-FIVE.

308
00:10:43,183 --> 00:10:45,560
WELL, MAYBE THIS 
WILL BE NICE. HMM?

309
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:49,023
WE CAN TALK AND... 
CONNECT A LITTLE.

310
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:53,110
- I MUST HAVE A XANAX.

311
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:55,445
- I'LL GO SCORE SOME WEED 
FROM THE STAFF.

312
00:10:55,445 --> 00:10:56,822
[narrator] 
AND MICHAEL AND BUSTER

313
00:10:56,822 --> 00:10:58,407
CHECKED OUT OF THE HOSPITAL.

314
00:10:58,407 --> 00:10:59,742
- I CAN'T BELIEVE 
THEY WOULDN'T GIVE ME

315
00:10:59,742 --> 00:11:01,201
A WHEELCHAIR RIDE.

316
00:11:01,201 --> 00:11:02,452
- YOU'RE GONNA BE 
SITTING ON A PLANE

317
00:11:02,452 --> 00:11:04,079
FOR 18 HOURS TO IRAQ.

318
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:05,831
- YEAH, I SHOULD DEFINITELY 
GET ONE FOR THE AIRPORT.

319
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:07,667
- YOU'RE GOING TO IRAQ?

320
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:09,835
- YES. I'M GOING 
TO SAVE MY BROTHER.

321
00:11:09,835 --> 00:11:12,171
- SO YOU ARE BRAVE AFTER ALL.

322
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:13,547
FIGHTING FOR YOUR BROTHER.

323
00:11:13,547 --> 00:11:17,718
OH, BUSTER, YOU'RE SUCH 
A-- [bleep]

324
00:11:17,718 --> 00:11:18,761
- THAT MEANS 
SHE LIKES YOU.

325
00:11:18,761 --> 00:11:20,262
- IT'S MORE THAN "LIKE."

326
00:11:20,262 --> 00:11:22,639
I'D GIVE ANYTHING 
TO HAVE YOU STAY HERE.

327
00:11:22,639 --> 00:11:24,975
- THEN I WILL STAY HERE. 
I WAS SCARED TO GO ANYWAY.

328
00:11:24,975 --> 00:11:26,769
- FAKER! 
- OH!

329
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:28,145
- I KNEW YOU WERE NO GOOD.

330
00:11:28,145 --> 00:11:30,355
- THAN I SHALL GO-- 
TO FORGET YOU.

331
00:11:30,355 --> 00:11:31,440
- OH, BUSTER, DON'T GO.

332
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,109
- I DON'T WANNA GO.

333
00:11:34,109 --> 00:11:35,903
- I'M GONNA SAVE EVERYBODY 
A LOT OF TROUBLE AND SAY

334
00:11:35,903 --> 00:11:37,780
THAT WE ARE GOING. 
HE IS GOING. COME ON.

335
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:39,406
- WHEN I MISS YOUR LIPS,

336
00:11:39,406 --> 00:11:41,784
I'LL PUT A FIG IN MY MOUTH 
AND THINK OF YOU.

337
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:45,245
THEY HAVE FIGS OVER THERE, 
RIGHT?

338
00:11:45,245 --> 00:11:47,372
- I'LL WAIT FOR YOU.

339
00:11:47,372 --> 00:11:48,833
WHAT'S THIS?

340
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:50,250
- CAB DRIVER SAID 
HE WENT INTO A COMA...

341
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:52,711
AS SOON AS THEY 
PULLED UP TO THE HOSPITAL.

342
00:11:52,711 --> 00:11:55,089
- WHAT A BRAVE MAN.

343
00:11:55,089 --> 00:11:56,966
[narrator] 
AND SOON THE BLUTH BOYS...

344
00:11:56,966 --> 00:11:59,676
FOUND THEMSELVES 
IN A STRANGE LAND.

345
00:12:00,845 --> 00:12:04,098
[arguing in Arabic language ]

346
00:12:06,641 --> 00:12:08,310
- WHAT DID HE SAY? 
WHERE ARE WE?

347
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:10,312
- HE SAID HE WAS TAKING 
SURFACE STREETS TO L.A.X.

348
00:12:10,312 --> 00:12:12,314
THE FREEWAY'S BACKED UP ALL THE 
WAY TO KNOTT'S BERRY FARM.

349
00:12:12,314 --> 00:12:13,941
[narrator] 
GEORGE MICHAEL, MEANWHILE,

350
00:12:13,941 --> 00:12:15,650
GOT AHOLD 
OF MAEBY'S ADDRESS BOOK...

351
00:12:15,650 --> 00:12:19,363
TO INVITE ALL HER FRIENDS 
TO HER SWEET 16.

352
00:12:19,363 --> 00:12:20,823
HE DID, HOWEVER, DECIDE

353
00:12:20,823 --> 00:12:22,867
AGAINST SOME GUESTS 
HE FOUND THREATENING.

354
00:12:22,867 --> 00:12:25,202
- I DON'T THINK STEVE HOLT 
HAS TO COME TO THIS.

355
00:12:25,202 --> 00:12:26,536
[cell phone beeps]

356
00:12:26,536 --> 00:12:28,038
AND YET HE DID INVITE 
MICKEY ROURKE.

357
00:12:28,038 --> 00:12:31,166
AND THE GUYS FINALLY DID 
GET TO IRAQ,

358
00:12:31,166 --> 00:12:33,210
BUT BUSTER'S ARABIC 
WAS A LITTLE RUSTY.

359
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:34,711
AND INSTEAD OF A CAB,

360
00:12:34,711 --> 00:12:38,132
HE HIRED THEM THE ONLY 
RICKSHAW IN BAGHDAD.

361
00:12:38,132 --> 00:12:40,342
- ARE YOU READY FOR 
OPERATION HOT BROTHER?

362
00:12:40,342 --> 00:12:42,344
- I'M NOT READY 
TO CALL IT THAT.

363
00:12:42,344 --> 00:12:43,804
[narrator] 
THEY ARRIVED AT THE PRISON

364
00:12:43,804 --> 00:12:46,015
THE AMERICANS WERE TRAINING 
IRAQIS TO RUN.

365
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:48,142
- NO. 
WHAT'D YOU FORGET?

366
00:12:48,142 --> 00:12:51,353
WALK THEM THROUGH THE-- 
THE WHAT?

367
00:12:51,353 --> 00:12:54,231
- THE METAL DETECTOR. 
- THAT'S OKAY. TRY AGAIN.

368
00:12:54,231 --> 00:12:55,858
- MY GOD! YOU CAME!

369
00:12:55,858 --> 00:12:56,942
- OKAY, OKAY.

370
00:12:56,942 --> 00:12:58,443
- OH, I MISSED YOU, 
MICHAEL!

371
00:12:58,443 --> 00:12:59,486
- ALL RIGHT. 
[chuckles]

372
00:12:59,486 --> 00:13:01,989
- OR SHOULD I SAY "ROBOT"?

373
00:13:01,989 --> 00:13:03,698
- WHAT, 'CAUSE I'M NOT CRYING?

374
00:13:03,698 --> 00:13:05,700
- MAYBE YOU DON'T HAVE ENOUGH 
RAM TO UNDERSTAND THIS,

375
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:08,703
BUT THERE'S SUCH A THING 
AS BROTHERLY LOVE.

376
00:13:08,703 --> 00:13:10,539
WHAT'S HE DOING HERE? 
I THOUGHT HE WAS IN A COMA.

377
00:13:10,539 --> 00:13:12,666
- I WAS TRYING TO PROVE 
TO THIS NURSE THAT I'M BRAVE.

378
00:13:12,666 --> 00:13:14,376
I NEED TO GET A PICTURE 
OF ME WITH THE INSURGENT.

379
00:13:14,376 --> 00:13:15,836
I CAN SEND IT ON MY PHONE.

380
00:13:15,836 --> 00:13:17,671
- WHY WERE YOU ARRESTED 
BY THE AMERICANS?

381
00:13:17,671 --> 00:13:19,381
- I WAS DOING A LITTLE 
OFF-MISSION STREET MAGIC,

382
00:13:19,381 --> 00:13:21,008
TRYING TO MAKE A FEW DINARS.

383
00:13:21,008 --> 00:13:24,929
AND THAT IS WHY JESUS 
WAS OFTEN REFERRED TO AS...

384
00:13:24,929 --> 00:13:28,891
"THE KING... OF KINGS."

385
00:13:28,891 --> 00:13:31,852
QUEENS. 
THE KING OF QUEENS.

386
00:13:31,852 --> 00:13:33,603
NOW I WOULD LIKE YOU TO BEHOLD

387
00:13:33,603 --> 00:13:35,730
ONE OF THE LATE, GREAT JESUS'S 
BIGGEST ILLUSIONS--

388
00:13:35,730 --> 00:13:37,316
[organ crescendo] 
THE BURNING BUSH!

389
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:39,526
[crowd] 
BUSH? BURN BUSH?

390
00:13:39,526 --> 00:13:41,778
BURN BUSH! 
BURNING BUSH!

391
00:13:41,778 --> 00:13:43,072
[crowd chanting] 
BURN BUSH!

392
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:44,406
[narrator] 
THE SECURITY FORCES

393
00:13:44,406 --> 00:13:46,200
ARRIVED TO SUPPRESS...

394
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,827
WHAT APPEARED TO BE 
AN ANTI-AMERICAN DEMONSTRATION.

395
00:13:48,827 --> 00:13:51,496
[stun gun buzzing] 
[chanting continues]

396
00:13:51,496 --> 00:13:53,040
- THAT'S OKAY. USE YOUR FOOT.

397
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:56,001
THE THIGH BRUISES. 
WHAT DOESN'T? TRY AGAIN.

398
00:13:56,001 --> 00:13:58,837
- SO YOU WEREN'T DOING 
ANYTHING FOR DAD?

399
00:13:58,837 --> 00:14:00,714
- HE HAD SAID, IF I HAPPENED 
TO BE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD

400
00:14:00,714 --> 00:14:02,216
OF SADR CITY AND MAMOON,

401
00:14:02,216 --> 00:14:03,758
WOULD I MIND TORCHING 
A COUPLE MODEL HOMES?

402
00:14:03,758 --> 00:14:05,260
DAD'S JUST TRYING 
TO KEEP INFORMATION OUT

403
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:07,262
OF THE HANDS OF THE IRAQIS.

404
00:14:07,262 --> 00:14:09,431
- I HAVE A FEELING HE WAS TRYING 
TO KEEP INFORMATION OUT OF THE

405
00:14:09,431 --> 00:14:11,141
HANDS OF THE FEDERAL MARSHALS.

406
00:14:11,141 --> 00:14:12,935
- I'M GONNA GO COLLECT MY THINGS 
AND SAY MY GOOD-BYES.

407
00:14:12,935 --> 00:14:14,353
YOU GUYS CHECK ME 
OUTTA HERE.

408
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:16,146
- GOB, YOU'RE AN ENEMY 
COMBATANT.

409
00:14:16,146 --> 00:14:18,732
IT'S NOT GONNA BE THAT EASY. 
I'LL TALK TO THEM,

410
00:14:18,732 --> 00:14:20,943
BUT YOU MIGHT WANNA PREPARE 
FOR A LONG STAY.

411
00:14:27,824 --> 00:14:30,160
- OH, SHOOT. I FORGOT 
TO SAY GOOD-BYE TO YUSEF.

412
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,495
- THAT WAS A LOT EASIER 
THAN I EXPECTED.

413
00:14:31,495 --> 00:14:33,622
ALMOST TOO EASY.

414
00:14:33,622 --> 00:14:35,665
- WHY AREN'T WE GOING 
TO THE AIRPORT?

415
00:14:35,665 --> 00:14:37,626
- I WANNA CHECK OUT THIS HOUSE 
DAD ASKED YOU TO BURN DOWN,

416
00:14:37,626 --> 00:14:39,294
SEE WHAT HE'S HIDING.

417
00:14:39,294 --> 00:14:42,631
I THINK THAT'S IT, SIR. 
- [throaty vocalization]

418
00:14:42,631 --> 00:14:44,008
- BUSTER, THIS GUY 
SPEAKS ENGLISH.

419
00:14:44,008 --> 00:14:46,135
- NO. 
I SWALLOWED A MOTH.

420
00:14:46,135 --> 00:14:48,220
- I'M SORRY IT TOOK SO LONG,

421
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:49,930
BUT THE CHENEY EXPRESSWAY

422
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:51,974
WAS BACKED UP ALL THE WAY 
TO HALLIBURTON DRIVE.

423
00:14:51,974 --> 00:14:53,683
[doorbell rings]

424
00:14:53,683 --> 00:14:55,144
- LET'S SEE WHAT ALL 
THE MYSTERY'S ABOUT.

425
00:14:55,144 --> 00:14:56,603
[narrator] 
THAT'S WHEN MICHAEL

426
00:14:56,603 --> 00:14:58,313
FOUND SOMEONE...

427
00:14:58,313 --> 00:15:00,315
THE U.S. GOVERNMENT 
HAD BEEN ABLE TO DEPOSE.

428
00:15:00,315 --> 00:15:03,610
- HELLO? 
- TAKE MY PICTURE!

429
00:15:03,610 --> 00:15:06,405
TAKE MY PICTURE! 
[giggling]

430
00:15:10,367 --> 00:15:11,868
[narrator] 
MICHAEL WAS IN IRAQ WHEN HE

431
00:15:11,868 --> 00:15:14,454
CAME ACROSS A FAMILIAR FACE.

432
00:15:14,454 --> 00:15:15,622
- [stammering] 
ARE YOU, UH--

433
00:15:15,622 --> 00:15:17,749
- I AM SADDAM HUSSEIN...

434
00:15:17,749 --> 00:15:19,876
LOOK-ALIKE.

435
00:15:19,876 --> 00:15:22,171
WHO ARE YOU? 
- I'M MICHAEL BLUTH.

436
00:15:22,171 --> 00:15:24,673
THESE ARE MY BROTHERS 
BUSTER AND GOB BLUTH.

437
00:15:24,673 --> 00:15:28,218
- BLUTH? IS HE HERE TO FIX 
THE AIR CONDITIONING?

438
00:15:28,218 --> 00:15:30,179
- ARE YOU BOTH 
SADDAM HUSSEIN LOOK-ALIKES?

439
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:32,889
- HARDLY. 
INVITE THEM IN.

440
00:15:32,889 --> 00:15:36,101
- I AM BEHAVING LIKE 
AN UDAY LOOK-ALIKE.

441
00:15:36,101 --> 00:15:38,562
COME ON IN. 
COME ON IN, GUYS.

442
00:15:38,562 --> 00:15:41,190
- I'D ALWAYS HEARD THAT THERE 
WERE SADDAM HUSSEIN LOOK-ALIKES.

443
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:42,732
I'M JUST A LITTLE SURPRISED

444
00:15:42,732 --> 00:15:45,277
TO SEE YOU ALL LIVING HERE 
IN-- IN ONE HOUSE...

445
00:15:45,277 --> 00:15:47,362
THAT LOOKS SO SIMILAR 
TO OURS.

446
00:15:47,362 --> 00:15:49,281
- SCAR ON THAT ONE DUDE'S 
FOREHEAD'S GOTTA BE A PROBLEM.

447
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:50,365
- THAT'S ACHMED.

448
00:15:50,365 --> 00:15:51,616
- NEVER STOP WATCHING THE TRIAL.

449
00:15:51,616 --> 00:15:55,412
WE ARE ALL FOLLOWING IT 
PRETTY CLOSELY.

450
00:15:55,412 --> 00:15:57,539
- THEY PUT THIS GUY AWAY, 
YOU GUYS ARE OUT OF A JOB, HUH?

451
00:15:57,539 --> 00:15:59,083
- YES, WE WANTED TO KEEP 
THE HOUSE FOR JUST

452
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:00,834
ONE MORE SEASON.

453
00:16:00,834 --> 00:16:02,169
- I HAVE A BABY ON THE WAY.

454
00:16:02,169 --> 00:16:05,297
- I DO A BETTER SADDAM 
THAN THIS GUY.

455
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:06,548
MY SADDAM 
WOULD SHOW HIS TEETH.

456
00:16:06,548 --> 00:16:08,342
- YES, TO CHEW THE SCENERY.

457
00:16:08,342 --> 00:16:09,551
[narrator] 
SO MICHAEL DECIDED

458
00:16:09,551 --> 00:16:11,220
THE LEAST HE COULD DO...

459
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:13,222
WAS TAKE A LOOK 
AT THE AIR CONDITIONING.

460
00:16:13,222 --> 00:16:15,265
BUT BEFORE HE DID, 
HE DECIDED TO SEE...

461
00:16:15,265 --> 00:16:19,353
IF THERE WAS A SECRET ROOM 
IN THIS MODEL HOME AS WELL.

462
00:16:19,353 --> 00:16:23,607
AND THAT'S WHEN MICHAEL 
DISCOVERED THE BOMBSHELL.

463
00:16:23,607 --> 00:16:25,484
[shutter clicks] 
- BUSTER.

464
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:27,652
[narrator] 
BACK AT THE AMERICAN MODEL HOME,

465
00:16:27,652 --> 00:16:30,572
NONE OF THE INVITEES HAD 
SHOWN UP FOR MAEBY'S PARTY.

466
00:16:30,572 --> 00:16:33,908
- SURPRISE. 
- THAT'S WHAT I FIGURED.

467
00:16:33,908 --> 00:16:35,410
SO, DID YOU SEND 
ONE OF THESE TO EVERYONE

468
00:16:35,410 --> 00:16:37,079
IN MY ADDRESS BOOK?

469
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:39,123
- YEAH. I'M REALLY SORRY 
THEY DIDN'T COME.

470
00:16:39,123 --> 00:16:42,167
I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED. 
- I DO. THEY FOUND OUT I WAS 16.

471
00:16:42,167 --> 00:16:43,960
[narrator] 
AND A LOT OF US

472
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:45,629
JUST DIDN'T WANT TO DRIVE 
DOWN TO ORANGE COUNTY.

473
00:16:45,629 --> 00:16:46,963
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

474
00:16:46,963 --> 00:16:48,548
- THIS COST ME MY JOB, 
GEORGE MICHAEL.

475
00:16:48,548 --> 00:16:51,885
I WAS A STUDIO EXECUTIVE. 
I MADE MOVIES.

476
00:16:51,885 --> 00:16:53,678
- IS THAT WHY YOU'VE BEEN 
SO STRESSED OUT ALL THE TIME?

477
00:16:53,678 --> 00:16:55,597
- HAVE I BEEN?

478
00:16:55,597 --> 00:16:57,932
YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M A KID. 
I'M GONNA START ACTING LIKE ONE.

479
00:16:57,932 --> 00:16:59,934
- WHAT, YOU'RE GONNA DRINK? 
- DO YOU WANNA JOIN ME?

480
00:16:59,934 --> 00:17:01,145
- I GUESS IF YOU CAN 
RUN A STUDIO--

481
00:17:01,145 --> 00:17:02,354
[drink pouring]

482
00:17:02,354 --> 00:17:04,106
[narrator] 
BUT THEY DIDN'T

483
00:17:04,106 --> 00:17:05,732
KNOW IT WAS THE FAKE WINE 
FROM GOB'S MAGIC SHOW.

484
00:17:05,732 --> 00:17:06,983
- IT'S GOOD.

485
00:17:06,983 --> 00:17:08,485
[narrator] 
AND BACK IN IRAQ.

486
00:17:08,485 --> 00:17:09,778
- WHAT IS THIS?

487
00:17:09,778 --> 00:17:12,781
- LOOKS LIKE A MID-RANGE 
NUCLEAR WARHEAD.

488
00:17:12,781 --> 00:17:14,033
IT HAS A RANGE CAPACITY

489
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:16,201
OF 4,000 TO 5,000 
NAUTICAL MILES.

490
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:17,911
- YOU'VE GOT A PRETTY 
SOPHISTICATED KNOWLEDGE

491
00:17:17,911 --> 00:17:18,953
OF THIS TECHNOLOGY.

492
00:17:18,953 --> 00:17:20,372
- MY GOD.

493
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:22,082
IT MAKES ME WANNA 
HAVE AN ICE CREAM CONE.

494
00:17:22,082 --> 00:17:23,792
DOESN'T THIS MAKE YOU WANNA 
HAVE AN ICE CREAM CONE?

495
00:17:23,792 --> 00:17:25,460
- IT DOES.

496
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:27,421
- YOU'LL HAVE PLENTY OF TIME 
FOR ICE CREAM IN PRISON.

497
00:17:27,421 --> 00:17:29,131
ICE CREAM SANDWICHES.

498
00:17:29,131 --> 00:17:30,174
C.I.A., UNDERCOVER.

499
00:17:30,174 --> 00:17:31,800
- C.I.A. OF COURSE.

500
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,009
THIS EXPLAINS 
WHY IT WAS SO EASY

501
00:17:33,009 --> 00:17:34,636
TO GET YOU OUT OF PRISON.

502
00:17:34,636 --> 00:17:36,638
- I KNEW THAT, IF HE GOT OUT, 
HE WOULD LEAD US...

503
00:17:36,638 --> 00:17:38,765
RIGHT TO WHATEVER 
YOUR DAD WAS HIDIN'.

504
00:17:38,765 --> 00:17:40,267
[narrator] 
THEY'D EVEN

505
00:17:40,267 --> 00:17:41,976
CREATED OPPORTUNITIES 
FOR THIS TO HAPPEN.

506
00:17:41,976 --> 00:17:44,271
- GET IN THE CELL, STUPID. 
- YOU'RE-- YOU'RE--

507
00:17:44,271 --> 00:17:45,814
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO DIDN'T 
EVEN SHUT THE DOOR.

508
00:17:45,814 --> 00:17:48,775
COME ON!

509
00:17:48,775 --> 00:17:51,486
YEAH. YOU GUYS CAN RUN 
THIS PLACE WITHOUT US.

510
00:17:51,486 --> 00:17:53,738
AS-- AS-- AS SOON AS YOU 
STOP DROPPING YOUR KEYS!

511
00:17:53,738 --> 00:17:55,365
COME ON!

512
00:17:55,365 --> 00:17:57,742
[narrator] 
THEY'D EVEN STAGED SOMETHING

513
00:17:57,742 --> 00:17:59,453
CALLED AN "HONOR MARATHON"...

514
00:17:59,453 --> 00:18:01,037
THEY THOUGHT HE WAS SURE 
TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF.

515
00:18:01,037 --> 00:18:03,790
- COME ON.

516
00:18:03,790 --> 00:18:05,834
- WE'VE BEEN LOOKIN' 
FOR W.M.D.'s FOR YEARS.

517
00:18:05,834 --> 00:18:07,502
- W.M.D.'s?

518
00:18:07,502 --> 00:18:11,340
THIS THING IS AS FAKE 
AS ACHMED'S MUSTACHE. SEE?

519
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:13,633
- YEAH, LOOK. IT'S A HOMEFILL.

520
00:18:13,633 --> 00:18:15,385
IT'S THE COMPANY

521
00:18:15,385 --> 00:18:17,221
THAT MAKES THE FAKE STUFF 
WE FILL THE MODEL HOMES WITH.

522
00:18:17,221 --> 00:18:18,472
- WHAT THE HELL?

523
00:18:18,472 --> 00:18:20,265
- WHAT IS THAT, 
A RECORDING DEVICE?

524
00:18:20,265 --> 00:18:22,476
- THIS IS OUR STUFF. 
I GOTTA CALL THIS IN.

525
00:18:22,476 --> 00:18:24,519
- BUSTER? PLEASE?

526
00:18:24,519 --> 00:18:26,271
- BAKER. 
[background: muzak]

527
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:27,647
IT DOESN'T SOUND 
LIKE C.I.A. EAST.

528
00:18:27,647 --> 00:18:29,524
I'LL CHECK WITH C.I.A. WEST.

529
00:18:29,524 --> 00:18:32,361
DID WE BUG A HOUSE 
IN MAMOON?

530
00:18:32,361 --> 00:18:33,778
- YEAH.

531
00:18:33,778 --> 00:18:35,322
WE GOT SOME GUY 
NAMED GEORGE BLUTH...

532
00:18:35,322 --> 00:18:37,366
TO BUILD HOUSES THERE 
SO WE COULD WIRE THEM.

533
00:18:37,366 --> 00:18:38,908
- [sighs]

534
00:18:38,908 --> 00:18:41,536
- OH, LOOK. I'M UNCLE BUSTER. 
- [laughing]

535
00:18:41,536 --> 00:18:43,663
- I'M SORRY NO ONE 
FROM THE FAMILY CAME.

536
00:18:43,663 --> 00:18:46,040
- SOMETIMES I WISH I WASN'T 
EVEN PART OF THE FAMILY.

537
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:47,792
- NO, DON'T-- 
- YES.

538
00:18:47,792 --> 00:18:50,920
- I'VE NEVER WANTED 
TO SAY THIS, BUT...

539
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:52,839
YOU MIGHT NOT EVEN 
BE RELATED TO US.

540
00:18:52,839 --> 00:18:54,341
- NO?

541
00:18:54,341 --> 00:18:55,509
- 'CAUSE GANGY 
ONCE SAID TO ME...

542
00:18:55,509 --> 00:18:56,718
YOUR MOM MIGHT NOT HAVE

543
00:18:56,718 --> 00:18:58,387
EVER EVEN BEEN PREGNANT 
WITH YOU.

544
00:18:58,387 --> 00:19:00,764
- YOU'RE JUST SAYING THAT 
TO MAKE ME FEEL BETTER.

545
00:19:00,764 --> 00:19:02,891
- NO. I'M, UH-- 
I WOULDN'T.

546
00:19:02,891 --> 00:19:05,394
EVERYONE STILL LOVES YOU.

547
00:19:06,478 --> 00:19:08,688
SOME MORE THAN OTHERS.

548
00:19:08,688 --> 00:19:09,731
[narrator] 
AND PERHAPS

549
00:19:09,731 --> 00:19:11,483
IT WAS THE FAKE WINE,

550
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:13,652
BUT THAT WAS THE NIGHT 
GEORGE MICHAEL AND MAEBY

551
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:14,694
WENT TO SECOND BASE.

552
00:19:16,821 --> 00:19:19,908
- SO MY DAD WAS A PATSY? 
[TV: trial continues]

553
00:19:19,908 --> 00:19:23,119
- WE CALL THEM "UNINTENTIONAL 
OPERATIONS VICTIMS," BUT YES.

554
00:19:23,119 --> 00:19:24,454
WE RAN THE WHOLE OPERATION

555
00:19:24,454 --> 00:19:26,080
THROUGH A BRITISH 
BUILDING COMPANY.

556
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:27,749
- THEY CONTACTED MY DAD 
FOR THE PLANS.

557
00:19:27,749 --> 00:19:29,083
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

558
00:19:29,083 --> 00:19:30,335
AFTER ALL OF THAT, 
HE WASN'T LYING.

559
00:19:30,335 --> 00:19:31,670
- LOOK, WE FEEL TERRIBLE.

560
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:34,130
BECAUSE THIS IS REALLY 
OUR MISTAKE.

561
00:19:34,130 --> 00:19:37,091
BUT I'M AFRAID I'M GONNA HAVE 
TO TAKE YOU GUYS OUT.

562
00:19:37,091 --> 00:19:39,428
TAKE US OUT? 
- WHAT?

563
00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:40,970
- I COULD REALLY GO 
FOR SOME ITALIAN.

564
00:19:40,970 --> 00:19:42,847
- THERE IS AN OLIVE GARDEN 
IN MAMOON.

565
00:19:42,847 --> 00:19:45,684
- I THINK HE MEANS 
TO SHOOT YOU IN THE HEAD.

566
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:48,603
BUT PLEASE, AT LEAST LET HIM 
LOOK AT THE AIR CONDITIONING.

567
00:19:48,603 --> 00:19:49,896
- IF YOU'RE WORRIED 
ABOUT US TALKING,

568
00:19:49,896 --> 00:19:51,648
WE WILL NOT SAY A WORD.

569
00:19:51,648 --> 00:19:53,358
- DON'T BE MAD, BUT I HAVE 
BEEN SENDING THE PICTURES

570
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:54,901
FROM MY CELL PHONE TO MY FRIEND.

571
00:19:54,901 --> 00:19:56,361
- NOT NOW, BUSTER.

572
00:19:56,361 --> 00:19:57,696
- HE DOES NOT KNOW 
WHAT HE'S SAYING.

573
00:19:57,696 --> 00:19:59,739
YOU HAVE? 
- UH--

574
00:19:59,739 --> 00:20:03,327
- WELL, WHO KNOWS 
WHO SHE SENT THEM TO?

575
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:09,416
- YEAH. YEAH, I GET IT. 
- HMM?

576
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:10,625
LOOKS LIKE 
YOU ARE A HERO, BUSTER.

577
00:20:10,625 --> 00:20:13,837
- WE BOTH ARE.

578
00:20:13,837 --> 00:20:15,088
- WELL--

579
00:20:15,088 --> 00:20:16,631
- OKAY. LOOKS LIKE 
YOU GOT US.

580
00:20:16,631 --> 00:20:18,758
WHAT CAN THE U.S. GOVERNMENT 
DO FOR YOU?

581
00:20:18,758 --> 00:20:20,719
- WE'RE GONNA NEED SOME 
BUSINESS CLASS TICKETS HOME--

582
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:23,137
AND DIRECT FLIGHTS.

583
00:20:23,137 --> 00:20:26,057
NONE OF THIS STOPPING 
IN PHOENIX-- [bleep]

584
00:20:26,057 --> 00:20:28,184
- AND MORE IMPORTANTLY, 
MAYBE WE CAN DROP...

585
00:20:28,184 --> 00:20:30,229
SOME OF THESE TREASON CHARGES 
AGAINST MY FATHER.

586
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:31,605
- AND I DO BELIEVE 
THERE WAS SOME MENTION

587
00:20:31,605 --> 00:20:34,316
OF SOME ICE CREAM.

588
00:20:34,316 --> 00:20:35,650
[narrator] 
AND SO, WITH OPERATION

589
00:20:35,650 --> 00:20:37,986
HOT BROTHER A SUCCESS,

00:20:37,986 --> 00:20:40,697
OUR AMERICAN HEROES 
LEFT IRAQ.

591
00:20:40,697 --> 00:20:43,950
- TAKE CONDOLEEZZA RICE LANE. 
IT'S QUICKER.

592
00:20:43,950 --> 00:20:46,828
[narrator] 
MISSION ACCOMPLISHED.

593
00:20:46,828 --> 00:20:49,623
ON THE NEXT 
ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT.

594
00:20:49,623 --> 00:20:51,375
TOBIAS GIVES HIS DAUGHTER 
THE GIFT HE'D STAYED UP

595
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:53,793
ALL NIGHT MAKING.

596
00:20:53,793 --> 00:20:56,421

OF YOUR MOTHER PREGNANT.

597
00:20:56,421 --> 00:20:57,672
AND HERE'S A WHOLE SERIES

598
00:20:57,672 --> 00:20:59,383
OF YOUR HEAD STARTING 
TO CROWN.

599
00:20:59,383 --> 00:21:02,802
LOOK AT YOU-- SO FULL 
OF WONDER AND SHOCK.

600
00:21:02,802 --> 00:21:05,430
YOU STILL DO IT. 
AND SO DOES HE!

601
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:06,723
[laughing]

602
00:21:06,723 --> 00:21:08,808
BOY, YOU GUYS 
REALLY ARE RELATED.

603
00:21:08,808 --> 00:21:10,143
[narrator] 
AND MICHAEL AND GOB

604
00:21:10,143 --> 00:21:11,478
MAKE AN INTERESTING DISCOVERY.

605
00:21:11,478 --> 00:21:12,896
- [translator on TV] 
I'M TELLING YOU,

606
00:21:12,896 --> 00:21:14,147
YOU'VE GOT THE WRONG GUY.

607
00:21:14,147 --> 00:21:16,608
THE REAL SADDAM 
HAS A SCAR ON HIS HEAD.

608
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:18,860
I'M NO SCAR. I'M NO SCAR.
