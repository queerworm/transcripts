Your office is only one floor

3
00:00:24,607 --> 00:00:25,859
[narrator] <i>It was true.</i>

4
00:00:25,942 --> 00:00:28,403
<i>When iconic producer Ron Howard</i>

5
00:00:28,486 --> 00:00:31,990

<i>in a movie about his family...</i>

6
00:00:32,073 --> 00:00:32,949
Them?

7
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:34,617
[narrator] <i>Michael had a problem.</i>

8
00:00:34,701 --> 00:00:37,078
We need everybody's signatures
on these releases to make this story.

9
00:00:37,162 --> 00:00:40,498
Although the real heartbeat of the thing
is the father-son dynamic.

10
00:00:40,582 --> 00:00:42,959
[narrator] <i>But he had fallen out of touch</i>
<i>with his father.</i>

11
00:00:43,209 --> 00:00:47,338
<i>So Michael was about to give up,</i>
<i>when something changed his mind.</i>

12
00:00:47,589 --> 00:00:48,673
I'm a movie producer.

13
00:00:48,757 --> 00:00:52,802
[narrator] <i>He was starting his first day</i>

14
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:55,889
Yeah? Must be a pretty important project
to him then, huh?

15
00:00:56,848 --> 00:00:58,183
That's one possibility.

16
00:00:59,017 --> 00:00:59,976
Watch your head.

17
00:01:01,311 --> 00:01:03,063
Are these ceilings a little lower?

18
00:01:03,188 --> 00:01:05,440
Brian and Ron wanted the ceiling
in their office

19
00:01:05,523 --> 00:01:07,067
to be a few inches taller,

20
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:09,152
but apparently, Bruckheimer knows someone
on city council,

21
00:01:09,235 --> 00:01:11,071
and they wouldn't let them
make the building taller.

22
00:01:11,279 --> 00:01:15,617
So Ron said, "F you, Jerry,"
and he went lower with his floor.

23
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:16,910
Everybody wins, huh?

24
00:01:17,202 --> 00:01:18,620
-Here we are.
-Oh!

25
00:01:18,828 --> 00:01:19,829
That's me, huh?

26
00:01:20,622 --> 00:01:22,248
Wow. Ceilings are even lower in here.

27
00:01:22,332 --> 00:01:24,834
Yeah, your office is right below Brian's.

28
00:01:25,168 --> 00:01:28,171
He wanted his ceiling
just a few inches taller than Ron's.

29
00:01:28,254 --> 00:01:29,964
-Okay.
-Some internal competition.

30
00:01:30,048 --> 00:01:31,466
Kind of like between us.

32
00:01:32,717 --> 00:01:34,677
Well, you have a family to track down.

33
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:36,721
Yeah, I do. Hey, speaking of that...

34
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:41,434
Kitty, is there a directory of actresses

No. Nothing like that.

37

I met this unbelievable woman

38
00:01:47,315 --> 00:01:49,067

00:07:31,909 --> 00:07:33,786
You haven't been like that in years.

166
00:07:34,036 --> 00:07:36,914
Oh, right. You mean, slow-witted?

167
00:07:36,998 --> 00:07:40,209
I hope you're ready
for more of the same today.

168
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:41,836
[growls]

169
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:43,880
[whimpers]

170
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:45,840
[narrator]
<i>George Sr. had a few problems.</i>

171
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:48,050
<i>His brother was sleeping with his wife,</i>

172
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:52,513
<i>the property he was going to sell</i>
<i>to the government to build the US wall on</i>

173
00:07:52,597 --> 00:07:54,015
<i>was in Mexico,</i>

174
00:07:54,098 --> 00:07:57,018
<i>and his sweat lodge colony</i>
<i>had just collapsed.</i>

175
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:59,645
<i>So he had to deal with first things first.</i>

176
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:03,149
If my identical twin brother
can get it up, then shouldn't I?

177
00:08:04,275 --> 00:08:06,110
Have you had any sexual feeling
at all lately?

178
00:08:06,194 --> 00:08:07,028
No.

179
00:08:07,403 --> 00:08:10,156
You know, the Hopi Indians
believed that this spot here,

180
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:13,159
when manipulated,
can create sexual feeling.

181
00:08:13,242 --> 00:08:16,245
-That's my penis.
-You don't have to tell me. Nothing?

182
00:08:16,412 --> 00:08:19,999
No, just a little curiosity as to why
you're checking your second hand.

183
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:21,459
Oh, this isn't my office.

184
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:24,712
You know, I don't get it.
I've been popping the pills,

185
00:08:24,795 --> 00:08:26,339
and I mean, nothing!

186
00:08:26,631 --> 00:08:29,467
-Are you under any pressure?
-Oh, no. Nothing out of the ordinary.

187
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:31,886
I mean,
there's some violating federal law stuff

188
00:08:31,969 --> 00:08:34,263
that'd put me in prison
for the rest of my life,

189
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:37,183
but I've made love
with treason charges over me before.

190
00:08:37,266 --> 00:08:40,603
No, it's something else.
It's not just the sex. I feel...

191
00:08:43,147 --> 00:08:44,398
I feel wrong...

192
00:08:45,107 --> 00:08:46,150
somehow.

193
00:08:48,694 --> 00:08:50,112
And I'm becoming weak.

194
00:08:52,615 --> 00:08:54,367
Sorry, had the old thinking cap on.

195
00:08:54,617 --> 00:08:55,785
Let's go to the lists.

196
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:58,412
[narrator] <i>And Dr. Norman proceeded</i>
<i>to run through a checklist</i>

197
00:08:58,496 --> 00:09:00,081
<i>of alternative medicine questions.</i>

198
00:09:00,164 --> 00:09:02,625
Did you drink some water that might have
a homeopathic memory of some molecule?

199
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:05,211
Do you keep track
of the molecules you ingest?

200
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,214
With homeopathy,
it's the molecules you don't ingest.

201
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:11,300
But I'm the one who can get hard,
so let's focus on you.

202
00:09:11,425 --> 00:09:14,303
[narrator] <i>He then went on</i>
<i>to explore some supernatural</i>

203
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:16,764
<i>or high-concept premise possibilities.</i>

204
00:09:16,847 --> 00:09:19,308
-Any earthquakes in a Chinese restaurant?
-No.

205
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:21,143
Any wishes you may have phrased badly,

206
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:23,271
or while a child was blowing out a candle?

207
00:09:23,354 --> 00:09:25,147
Have you come
across any ancient games,

208
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:29,360
let's say, glowing games,
either board-based or carnival-based,

209
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:31,529
that you may have played
against the wishes of your best friend?

210
00:09:31,612 --> 00:09:32,446
No.

211
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:35,575
Curses, hexes, spells,
shaman, medicine men?

212
00:09:37,827 --> 00:09:38,744
Wait.

213
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:41,372
The strong will become the weak.

214
00:09:41,455 --> 00:09:44,000
The weak will become the strong.

215
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:48,504
I did hallucinate one ancient
foreboding warrior harbinger

216
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:52,049
while I chewed maca root about a year ago.
Could that be something?

217
00:09:52,216 --> 00:09:53,342
No, it's not the maca.

218
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:55,344
Your body wants the maca.

219
00:09:55,678 --> 00:09:56,679
It's not the maca.

220
00:09:56,804 --> 00:10:00,266
[narrator] <i>But finally out of desperation,</i>
<i>he turned to Western medicine.</i>

221
00:10:00,349 --> 00:10:01,976
Tell you what,
let's get some film on you.

222
00:10:02,059 --> 00:10:05,813
I'd like you to get on an MRI machine
and try to ride it to climax.

223
00:10:05,896 --> 00:10:07,857
I'm gonna send you over
to Orange County Imaging.

224
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:09,108
They do a ton of that.

225
00:10:09,191 --> 00:10:10,860
Okay. Do I get magazines?

226
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:12,820
Yeah. I'll write you a script for that.

227
00:10:12,903 --> 00:10:15,323
They got a place right around the corner
that plays ball.

228
00:10:15,781 --> 00:10:16,699
-[door opens]
-[men shouting]

229
00:10:16,782 --> 00:10:19,035
-Oh. Run.
-What? Oh.

230
00:10:24,248 --> 00:10:26,375
[narrator]
<i>Michael was trying to make a movie,</i>

231
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:28,127
<i>without having the rights to do so.</i>

232
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:31,088
We're making the movie about the family,
and I thought,

233
00:10:31,172 --> 00:10:33,633
"I wonder if Carl Weathers
would be willing to help me out."

234
00:10:33,716 --> 00:10:35,843
-Let me ask you this right up front.
-Okay.

235
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:40,473
Do you think anybody would be upset
if one of these Grinch dolls took a walk?

236
00:10:41,098 --> 00:10:42,600
No, help yourself.

237
00:10:43,392 --> 00:10:46,687
I know what you're thinking.
"What part would I play in this?"

238
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:48,939
I figured you'd want me to play me.

239
00:10:49,273 --> 00:10:51,525
Well, I didn't want to waste you on you.

240
00:10:51,609 --> 00:10:55,571
I wasn't gonna talk to you about acting,
but if you are game, that would be great.

241
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:56,781
Let's circle back to that.

242
00:10:56,947 --> 00:10:58,991
There's a television show, was it?

243
00:10:59,075 --> 00:11:01,369
That you made about my family.

244
00:11:01,619 --> 00:11:05,206
[narrator] <i>Michael was referring</i>
<i>to the George Bluth Sr. episode</i>

245
00:11:05,289 --> 00:11:08,084
{\an8}<i>of a horribly narrated</i>
<i>crime reenactment series</i>

246
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:11,379
{\an8}<i>called </i>Scandalmakers
<i>that Carl had directed years earlier.</i>

247
00:11:11,462 --> 00:11:13,881
Did you retain the rights
to my father's story?

248
00:11:13,964 --> 00:11:17,009
No, man, rights cost money.
I never bothered with that stuff.

249
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:18,761
I figure you go ahead, you shoot it.

250
00:11:18,844 --> 00:11:21,514
Better to ask for forgiveness
than beg for permission.

251
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:24,767
[narrator] <i>As it turned out,</i>
<i>Carl had never bothered to get either,</i>

252
00:11:25,142 --> 00:11:29,313
{\an8}<i>which is why he made himself the subject</i>
<i>of the final episode of the series.</i>

253
00:11:29,563 --> 00:11:32,316
Lee Nails. Only pressed-on once. [laughs]

254
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,944
Carl, we're at a swap meet. Okay.

255
00:11:35,152 --> 00:11:35,986
There he is.

256
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,947
Mr. Weathers... Carl Weathers.

257
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:39,573
You've been accused of producing

258
00:11:39,657 --> 00:11:41,867
a television show based
on real-life events

259
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:44,161
for which you've done none
of the due diligence

260
00:11:44,245 --> 00:11:46,455
in securing the rights thereto.

261
00:11:46,664 --> 00:11:48,082
I only have one question.

262
00:11:48,582 --> 00:11:51,585
-Can I have your rights?
-Of course, Carl Weathers.

263
00:11:51,836 --> 00:11:54,130
Cut! Now we'll move on,
do a little voice-over.

264
00:11:55,339 --> 00:11:57,091
Oh, God. DeBrie! Oh, God.

265
00:11:57,174 --> 00:11:59,468
Her heart stopped.
She's [bleeps] dying!

266
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:02,638
[laughs] You're as green
as old lady Grinch. Come on.

267
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:06,767
People don't go to movies to see rights.
People go to movies to see actors.

268
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:08,811
Now, who you got as scriptwriter?

269
00:12:08,894 --> 00:12:10,563
[narrator]
<i>And that's when Michael remembered</i>

270
00:12:10,646 --> 00:12:12,940
<i>that he did know one member</i>
<i>of the Writers Guild.</i>

271
00:12:13,023 --> 00:12:14,608
The eye's fallen off this one.

272
00:12:14,692 --> 00:12:16,902
You mind if I swap it out,
for the restaurant?

273
00:12:16,986 --> 00:12:17,820
Swap it.

274
00:12:18,154 --> 00:12:20,990
[MIchael] And I thought, "Who's gonna
get it right the first time?"

275
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:22,825
I don't want to give a lot of notes.

276
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:24,243
Then it came to me.

277
00:12:24,535 --> 00:12:26,996
Who knows my father better
than Warden Gentles?

278
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:29,999
Hold on one second.

279
00:12:30,374 --> 00:12:33,335
-"The... first... time."
-Yeah.

280
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:35,796
My grandson gave me this,
but I guarantee you,

281
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,757
give me an old Royal
and a glass of Scotch,

282
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:40,968
and I'll give you 250 pages
where the lightning hits the tree.

283
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:42,511
That's not what we do here.

284
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:44,263
I mean, where the drop hits the pond.

285
00:12:44,346 --> 00:12:45,639
-That's it.
-I apologize.

286
00:12:45,723 --> 00:12:47,224
I've had a few meetings today.

287
00:12:47,308 --> 00:12:51,353
{\an8}Then the yellow robot gets mad
at the pink robot...

288
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:53,898
-That does--
-Correction. The purple robot.

289
00:12:54,106 --> 00:12:56,776
Sorry, I'm back to back today.

290
00:12:57,026 --> 00:12:58,694
I bet. I'm gonna be honest with you.

291
00:12:58,778 --> 00:13:00,237
You're not charring my tree

292
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:01,697
and...

293
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:04,950
Yeah, Jerry's not gonna come off the boat
for this one.

294
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:07,661
This is basically a story about
a fellow like myself

295
00:13:07,745 --> 00:13:11,415
and his father
and their friend Carl Weathers.

296
00:13:11,499 --> 00:13:16,045
I'm not entirely sure how
to organically work him into the story.

297
00:13:16,128 --> 00:13:19,131
Maybe he's teaching them lessons
or something.

298
00:13:19,215 --> 00:13:21,801
Anyway, I'm gonna leave that up
to your capable hands.

299
00:13:21,884 --> 00:13:23,886
Wait a minute. [tapping keypad]

300
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:26,305
I've turned it off again.

301
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:27,473
They're tricky.

302
00:13:27,723 --> 00:13:31,018
Might I suggest bringing in
someone younger to play the father?

303
00:13:31,101 --> 00:13:32,686
A Philip Seymour Hoffman type?

304
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:34,271
A Philip Seymour Hoffman type.

305
00:13:34,563 --> 00:13:37,733
[narrator] <i>Michael, who was unfamiliar</i>
<i>with the legendary actor's work,</i>

306
00:13:38,025 --> 00:13:39,610
<i>thought he knew of such a type.</i>

307
00:13:39,693 --> 00:13:41,111
Naturally, I thought of you.

308
00:13:41,195 --> 00:13:43,280
Well, you know, I'm a married man,

309
00:13:43,364 --> 00:13:46,450
so I don't keep a directory
of attractive young actresses around.

310
00:13:46,534 --> 00:13:47,368
Okay.

311
00:13:47,451 --> 00:13:51,038
Are you really planning on using her,
or is it like Conan with girl writers?

312
00:13:51,789 --> 00:13:52,706
It doesn't matter.

313
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:56,085
I'm here to talk to you about a movie
that we're gonna make about the family,

314
00:13:56,168 --> 00:13:58,379
and I thought it might be really fun
for us to work together again.

315
00:13:58,546 --> 00:14:00,798
Help me remember.
What did we do together?

316
00:14:01,048 --> 00:14:03,926
You came over for a chicken
and ham water dinner that my family threw

317
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:05,135
to raise some funds for itself.

318
00:14:05,219 --> 00:14:08,430
They're finally getting around
to making a movie of that, huh?

319
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:09,473
There's more to it than that.

320
00:14:09,557 --> 00:14:13,811
It's about a young man trying to get out
from under his domineering father

321
00:14:13,894 --> 00:14:15,604
while dealing with the slow death
of his wife.

322
00:14:15,896 --> 00:14:17,273
You just saved me 12 bucks.

323
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:19,400
I'm not gonna see it.

324
00:14:19,483 --> 00:14:21,360
I'd like for you to be in it.

325
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:24,363
No offense, I have a job.
I mean, I have a good thing.

326
00:14:24,446 --> 00:14:25,906
-Mr. O'Brien.
-How's it going?

327
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:27,074
Andy, quick note.

328
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:30,703
Just 'cause I look at you when we're doing
the show and ask you a question,

329
00:14:30,786 --> 00:14:31,954
it doesn't mean you have to respond.

330
00:14:32,413 --> 00:14:34,248
Sometimes it's funny
when you don't say anything,

331
00:14:34,331 --> 00:14:38,961
and the audience gets to think,
"Hey, Andy really is stupid." [laughs]

332
00:14:39,169 --> 00:14:40,212
Gets a big laugh.

333
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:42,423
-Hey, you're new.
-Been here a year.

334
00:14:42,506 --> 00:14:43,924
[laughs] You're funny, too.

335
00:14:44,675 --> 00:14:45,968
Let's get you set up in a writer's office.

336
00:14:46,468 --> 00:14:49,138
You can have Andy's
if you don't mind the smell of bologna.

337
00:14:50,431 --> 00:14:51,390
I'm in.

-Sorry. Slide show of my granddaughter's--

-Daughter's graduation from college.
-Sure.

-Michael.
-High school.

348
00:15:12,036 --> 00:15:13,162
Did you get the signatures?

349
00:15:13,495 --> 00:15:16,957
Better. I put together the core team.
Acting and writing.

350
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:20,377
You guys do remember I have to be
in Burbank by one every day, right?

351
00:15:20,461 --> 00:15:21,295
We got that, Andy.

352
00:15:21,378 --> 00:15:23,589
I'm looking forward to this.
This is happening.

353

-It is happening.
-It's happening.

354
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:27,134
Dude, you are moving way too fast.

355
00:15:27,217 --> 00:15:28,594
Maybe by Hollywood standards,

356
00:15:28,677 --> 00:15:30,679
but, Kitty,
I'm from the business community,

357
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:33,474
where sometimes you have to
show it to them already built.

358
00:15:33,682 --> 00:15:34,934
Still think you're gonna bury me?

359
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:38,103
Well, Michael,
you may not have your father's signature,

360
00:15:38,395 --> 00:15:40,522
but you sure have his signature style.

361
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:41,982
Cue the music.

362
00:15:43,984 --> 00:15:46,028
I think I just deleted my pitch.

Uh-oh.

365
00:15:52,117 --> 00:15:54,036
Hello. Think there's a problem
with the elevator.

366
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:55,788
Do you have a scheduled appointment?

367
00:15:55,871 --> 00:15:59,458
No, no, we're here to see Ron Howard.
This is the untitled Michael B. project.

368
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:00,751
I'm actually a producer here.
How are you?

369
00:16:00,834 --> 00:16:03,462
I've got the office just below
the sunken living room there in Brian's.

370
00:16:03,545 --> 00:16:05,005
We're here to pitch Ron the movie.

371
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:07,174
I'm sorry, sir,
this is a restricted floor.

372
00:16:07,257 --> 00:16:10,427
Luisa, it's all right. Crying out loud,
I'm not the king of England.

373
00:16:10,511 --> 00:16:12,596
-There he is. Hey, Ron.
-Oh, did you get that signature?

374
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:15,265
You know, I've got something better.
Take a look.

375
00:16:16,684 --> 00:16:17,518
Andy Richter...

376
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:18,602
I'm out.

377
00:16:18,769 --> 00:16:20,104
God damn it, I'm out.

378
00:16:20,187 --> 00:16:22,982
Not married to Andy,
but what I do have is the writer.

379
00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:26,318
Stefan Gentles, Warden, East Orange County
Department of Corrections

380
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:29,613
and writer of multiple episodes
of <i>Rocko's Modern Life.</i>

381
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:32,282
Well, everybody's got
to start somewhere, right?

382
00:16:32,366 --> 00:16:34,326
-As long as I don't end up there.
-[Carl Weathers] Mnh-mnh.

383
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:37,663
I'll have 25 pages on your desk
by tomorrow morning.

384
00:16:37,746 --> 00:16:39,999
Gosh, that's putting
the cart before the horse.

385
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:42,292
Look who I've got to play Carl Weathers.

386
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:43,502
Oh, is that Cuba?

387
00:16:43,585 --> 00:16:47,548
Huh? No, no, no, that's not Cuba.
I did not want to waste Cuba on Carl.

388
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:48,966
This is Carl Weathers.

389
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:51,010
Oh, sure, Carl.

390
00:16:51,385 --> 00:16:54,471
I thought it was Cuba
with the perfect Carl Weathers makeup.

391
00:16:54,555 --> 00:16:57,349
No, no, no,
Cuba doesn't have that kind of range.

392
00:16:57,683 --> 00:17:01,270
The thing is, I really do insist
on controlling the casting myself.

393
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:03,605
I get it. I thought maybe
if you just saw the whole team together.

394
00:17:03,939 --> 00:17:06,650
Team, what team?
I should be informed of all meetings.

395
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:07,901
[Brian Grazer] Hey, Cuba, how you doing?

396
00:17:07,985 --> 00:17:10,279
[Ron] Brian, you know
Carl Weathers, Andy Richter,

397
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:11,864
Stefan Gentles and Michael Bluth.

398
00:17:17,077 --> 00:17:18,454
I'm gonna skip this one.

399
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:20,330
Good to see you, Brian.

400
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:24,168
Ron, it might be easier to talk
if we come up just the rest of the way.

401
00:17:24,251 --> 00:17:25,085
Oh, thanks.

402
00:17:25,377 --> 00:17:28,172
Yeah, the elevator's been kooky
since we lowered the floor.

403
00:17:28,255 --> 00:17:29,840
Maybe once you get that signature.

404
00:17:30,215 --> 00:17:31,592
It might be kind of tricky.

405
00:17:31,675 --> 00:17:34,261
They're all down in Orange County.
Tough to get down there.

406
00:17:34,344 --> 00:17:35,637
-Oh, hey, B.
-Yeah.

407
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:36,930
[Ron] We must have an office
down there somewhere.

408
00:17:37,014 --> 00:17:39,641
-Yeah, we'll stick you someplace.
-We'll stick you someplace.

in person.

426
00:18:32,486 --> 00:18:34,780
I think that you're a little late, okay?

427
00:18:34,863 --> 00:18:37,449
Because I went to you
for a simple signature,

428
00:18:37,825 --> 00:18:40,244
not so I could just make a movie
about the family,

429
00:18:40,327 --> 00:18:43,747
but so that I can move on with my life,
and you told me to go to hell.

430
00:18:43,831 --> 00:18:48,377
Yeah, sometimes when I'm caught off guard,
I say things I don't mean.

431
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:49,711
This is a horrible little office.

-So you're here to apologize?
-Sure.

433
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:56,343
And of course to see you
at Orange County I-ma-gine.

434
00:18:56,677 --> 00:18:57,594
And what's that?

435
00:18:58,095 --> 00:19:00,848

441
00:19:13,944 --> 00:19:16,405
I apologize.
I was saying it was a very original gift.

-I will use it.

Okay, so I guess things
haven't been going that well for me.

453
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:47,603
You didn't feel you could tell me?
That's why I haven't heard from you?

454
00:19:47,895 --> 00:19:50,939
I guess I was afraid that if I admitted
Sudden Valley was a failure...

455
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:53,525
-Told you so.
-you might say, "I told you so."

456
00:19:54,484 --> 00:19:56,570
Well, then you don't know me at all.

457
00:19:56,945 --> 00:19:59,323
Sorry. It's my fault.
I bit off more than I could chew.

signature on a release. It's like--

463

I didn't know it was about lying
to a girl.

464
00:20:17,382 --> 00:20:18,383
