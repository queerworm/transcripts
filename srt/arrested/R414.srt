I can't do that.

134

[narrator]<i> Actually, he'd tried,</i>
<i>but couldn't afford it.</i>

135
00:06:40,691 --> 00:06:42,819
It's a 40 for the flip
and a 40 for the flop,

136
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:45,446
and since it's gonna cause a flap,
I'd say another 40.

-Bees!

321
00:15:31,513 --> 00:15:32,640
-Bees! Oh!
-[loud buzzing]

322

He caused my colony to collapse.

323
00:15:35,392 --> 00:15:38,020
[sighs] My God, George,
get him another job.

324
00:15:38,145 --> 00:15:40,606
You must have some favors
you can call in somewhere.

325
00:15:41,315 --> 00:15:45,736
And then you can have some of my favors,
Mr. President.

326
00:15:45,903 --> 00:15:48,322
As much as I'd like to stay
and lay some more pipe with you,

327
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:49,907
I better get moving on this thing.

328
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:51,867
You've gotta make this work, George.

329
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:54,620
Send me some evidence of a wall
I can show the Chinese.

330
00:15:55,037 --> 00:15:56,205
And the government.

331
00:15:56,372 --> 00:15:58,374
We need to make this happen, George.

332
00:15:58,499 --> 00:16:01,669
The Chinese have more than
a sharpened noodle with my name on it.

333
00:16:01,835 --> 00:16:04,254
<i>-And soon, George Bluth did just that.</i>
-Hi, I'm George Bluth,

334
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:06,173
of the Bluth Company,

335
00:16:06,382 --> 00:16:09,259
and, uh, we've built this wall.

336
00:16:09,343 --> 00:16:13,138
We have miles and miles of wall.

337
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:15,683
-Uh, will you confirm that, soldier?
-Yeah.

338
00:16:15,891 --> 00:16:16,892
[groans]

339
00:16:17,267 --> 00:16:19,728
It's about protecting our border,

340
00:16:19,853 --> 00:16:24,900
which is why we have a member
of our armed forces with us today.

341
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:27,236
-Say hello.
-[coughs, groans]

342
00:16:27,569 --> 00:16:30,322
It's, uh, triple reinforced,
steel reinforced,

343
00:16:30,406 --> 00:16:32,908
and I don't really know how to say

344
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:36,328
that what it does is it protects, um--

345
00:16:36,453 --> 00:16:37,871
It's Mexican-proof.

346
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:39,790
So... Can't say...

347
00:16:39,915 --> 00:16:40,749
Well...

348
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,293
Gosh darn it, it is Mexican-proof.

349
00:16:43,377 --> 00:16:44,503
[groans]

350
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:46,672
Sit up. Um--

351
00:16:46,755 --> 00:16:48,424
-Daddy, my tummy's turning.
-All right.

352
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:52,052
-Um, uh, it's triple reinforced.
-Daddy, I gotta get out.

353
00:16:52,219 --> 00:16:54,013
You're gonna be-- Oh, for God's sake!

354
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:57,391
-Get out!
-I need to get out. I need to get out!

355
00:16:57,683 --> 00:17:00,728
We're not gonna--
We'll edit this part out and, uh-- Oh!

356
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:02,021
Anyhow...

357
00:17:02,104 --> 00:17:05,024
[narrator]
<i>But George Sr. hadn't built miles of wall.</i>

358
00:17:05,107 --> 00:17:08,444
<i>He just found a roundabout way</i>
<i>to make it seem that way.</i>

359
00:17:13,824 --> 00:17:17,327
[narrator]<i> Michael the producer</i>
<i>arrived to meet his lady Cinderella Man</i>

360
00:17:17,411 --> 00:17:18,704
<i>at the Ealing Club,</i>

361
00:17:19,246 --> 00:17:20,956
<i>-an exclusive show business hangout.</i>
-Ron Howard.

362
00:17:21,081 --> 00:17:22,291
Oh, thank you.

363
00:17:23,167 --> 00:17:26,754
-No, it's Michael Bluth. Hi.
-Oh, I remember.

364
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:28,964
I did it. I got my father's signature.

365
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:32,217
You said you wanted to focus
on the father-son relationship, and I love it.

366
00:17:32,342 --> 00:17:35,637
Who's not gonna be able to relate to a son
standing up to his self-centered father?

367
00:17:35,763 --> 00:17:38,390
Sure. But the father-son relationship
I was interested in

368
00:17:38,474 --> 00:17:41,810
was not you and your father,
it was you and your son.

369
00:17:42,436 --> 00:17:43,395
You're the father.

370
00:17:45,439 --> 00:17:48,233
-But that would make my son the son.
-Bingo.

371
00:17:51,028 --> 00:17:53,405
I don't think I can do it.
I don't think I can go...

372
00:17:53,864 --> 00:17:56,450
I can't go to my son. That's, uh--
I just--

373
00:17:56,575 --> 00:17:59,286
I don't even think that it's worth it
just to say that I'm a producer, like...

374
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:01,121
It's your call.

375
00:18:01,246 --> 00:18:03,624
Maybe the real estate business
will come around soon.

376
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:05,667
Will it?

377
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:09,963
I could never reveal that information
to a non-producer.

378
00:18:10,506 --> 00:18:14,009
[narrator]<i> And then he heard something</i>
<i>that made him change his mind.</i>

379
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:17,638
Michael? Mr. Movie Producer.

380
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:18,972
That's me.

381
00:18:19,056 --> 00:18:21,058
[up-tempo Scottish tune]

382
00:18:22,518 --> 00:18:24,520
[narrator] <i>And like all bagpipe music,</i>

383
00:18:24,645 --> 00:18:27,106
<i>it was hard to tell</i>
<i>if it was good music played horribly</i>

384
00:18:27,981 --> 00:18:30,317
<i>or horrible music played well.</i>

385
00:18:30,442 --> 00:18:32,778
<i>But Michael was eager</i>
<i>to find out her name</i>

386
00:18:32,903 --> 00:18:34,863
<i>when she was introduced</i>
<i>at the end of the set.</i>

387

-On the drum, Dave!
-[crowd cheering]

388
00:18:37,032 --> 00:18:38,784

389
00:18:38,992 --> 00:18:40,994
-R...
-[bleating loudly]

[cheers and applause]

391
00:18:45,749 --> 00:18:47,292
<i>-But he got to know her anyway.</i>
-Fantastic.

392
00:18:47,417 --> 00:18:49,378
I'm only doing this in between movies.

393
00:18:49,503 --> 00:18:52,506
Which, given how badly I bombed
at that audition yesterday,

394
00:18:52,589 --> 00:18:55,425
-it's gonna be a while.
-I could put your name in for something.

395
00:18:55,717 --> 00:18:57,803
-I do know Ron Howard.
-[laughs]

396
00:18:58,554 --> 00:19:00,556
Love that I make you laugh.

397
00:19:00,764 --> 00:19:02,516
You seriously would be great
for this part.

398
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:05,686
You remind me of the person
that it's based on. Uh...

399
00:19:05,853 --> 00:19:07,729
She actually dies on camera.

400
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:11,692
Well, make her mentally challenged
and I'll thank you in my Oscar speech.

401
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:14,403
There's a part like that, too,
only she's British,

402
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:16,488
so no one could ever tell
that she's disabled.

403
00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:18,824
I haven't been in work mode
for a while, to be honest.

404
00:19:18,949 --> 00:19:22,202
-I've been raising my son.
-Oh, you have a son? I have a son.

405
00:19:22,286 --> 00:19:23,245
-You do?
-Yeah.

406
00:19:23,328 --> 00:19:25,038
We've got a little issue,
though, right now.

407
00:19:25,122 --> 00:19:25,956
Let me guess.

408
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:27,457
He's pushing you away?

409
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:28,625
Yes.

410
00:19:28,709 --> 00:19:31,420
My son practically kicked me out
of his school the other day.

411
00:19:31,795 --> 00:19:34,339
That is literally what my son did to me.

412
00:19:34,464 --> 00:19:37,176
Then I said to him,
"You have no privacy from me."

413
00:19:37,509 --> 00:19:38,760
That's what I should do.

414
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:41,054
Lem's six in August. Yours?

415
00:19:41,305 --> 00:19:43,307
-Seven in July.
-Oh!

416
00:19:43,473 --> 00:19:47,019
[narrator] <i>Michael regretted the lie,</i>
<i>so he sort of split the difference.</i>

417
00:19:47,144 --> 00:19:50,063
-Teen, 17, in July.
-Oh.

418
00:19:50,522 --> 00:19:52,524
-Grow up so fast, don't they?
-Oh, wow.

419
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:56,486
Well, I guess you gotta move on
with your life sometime.

420
00:19:57,821 --> 00:19:58,697
Yes.

421
00:20:00,782 --> 00:20:01,617
Yes, you do.

422
00:20:06,955 --> 00:20:08,165
This is not a good idea.

423
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:17,716
Wow, you weren't kidding
when you said you had a part for me.

424
00:20:17,799 --> 00:20:19,843
-That was absolutely insane.
-Thanks.

425
00:20:19,968 --> 00:20:21,678
I've never done anything
that crazy before.

426
00:20:21,762 --> 00:20:24,014
I wanna do a lot more of that.
I wanna see you again.

427
00:20:24,097 --> 00:20:26,975
I wanna take you out
to a nice dinner, so then--

428
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:29,728
Well, this will have to tide you over
until then.

429
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:31,146
Wow, look at those.

430
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:33,523
Boy, without this,
I wouldn't know you had a tattoo.

431
00:20:33,649 --> 00:20:36,944
I know. Anyone that gets that much
clothing off me better know my name.

432
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:38,153
Your name?

433
00:20:38,278 --> 00:20:39,821
-Good night.
-Good night.
