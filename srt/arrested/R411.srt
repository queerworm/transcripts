00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:16,891
[narrator] <i>Three days before</i>
<i>many of the Bluths</i>

2
00:00:16,975 --> 00:00:18,393
<i>would come back together,</i>

3
00:00:18,476 --> 00:00:20,311
<i>Lindsay Bluth was on her way</i>

4
00:00:20,395 --> 00:00:21,479
<i>to the first phase</i>

5
00:00:21,604 --> 00:00:24,816
<i>-of an act of political sabotage...</i>
-My dad's tux looks good on you.

6
00:00:24,899 --> 00:00:26,693
<i>...with her face-blind boyfriend.</i>

7
00:00:26,776 --> 00:00:27,652
I don't care.

8
00:00:28,278 --> 00:00:29,779
<i>Together, they were targeting...</i>

9
00:00:29,863 --> 00:00:31,698
This guy... Herbert Love.

10
00:00:31,781 --> 00:00:33,116
<i>A candidate whose campaign slogan</i>

11
00:00:33,199 --> 00:00:35,785
<i>...say High-low to my Low-high plan.</i>

12
00:00:35,952 --> 00:00:37,579
<i>The "Low" is for low taxes.</i>

13
00:00:37,662 --> 00:00:40,999
[narrator] <i>...was embraced by everyone</i>
<i>from the very wealthy...</i>

14
00:00:41,082 --> 00:00:42,500
<i>...and who doesn't want high income?</i>

15
00:00:42,584 --> 00:00:44,586
<i>[narrator]</i>
<i>...to their bankers and tax attorneys.</i>

16
00:00:45,712 --> 00:00:48,757
<i>It's worth noting that this</i>
<i>was the same Herbert Love</i>

17
00:00:49,966 --> 00:00:53,136
<i>who'd recently adopted Lindsay's brother..</i>
<i>.Buster Bluth.</i>

18
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:54,846
We could use a <i>Blind Side</i> monster.

19
00:00:54,929 --> 00:00:56,097
<i>And Herbert was soon</i>

20
00:00:56,181 --> 00:00:58,099
<i>using the veteran at rallies.</i>

21
00:00:58,183 --> 00:00:59,642
Hold your government hand out...

22
00:00:59,726 --> 00:01:01,644
<i>...as a symbol of government waste.</i>

23
00:01:01,728 --> 00:01:03,980
Let's give freedom from government

24
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:05,315
a big thumbs up.

25
00:01:05,523 --> 00:01:07,108
<i>...although Buster had not mastered</i>

26
00:01:07,192 --> 00:01:10,070
<i>the use of his Army-issued, bionic hand.</i>

27
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:13,114
<i>Buster's actual father, George Sr.,</i>

28
00:01:13,198 --> 00:01:15,241
<i>needed the help of Herbert Love...</i>

29
00:01:15,325 --> 00:01:17,118
-What?
-He's got a rally tonight.

30
00:01:17,202 --> 00:01:19,412
<i>...to gain support for a wall project...</i>

31
00:01:19,496 --> 00:01:21,623
{\an8}<i>...to separate the US and Mexico</i>

32
00:01:21,748 --> 00:01:22,999
<i>to keep out the immigrants.</i>

33
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:25,251
<i>which some considered insensitive.</i>

34
00:01:25,335 --> 00:01:26,503
-Your idea.
-Which was my idea!

35
00:01:26,628 --> 00:01:30,215
<i>George Sr. was feeling</i>
<i>more sensitive by the day.</i>

36
00:01:30,298 --> 00:01:33,093
I'd be lucky to sell a glass of lemonade
for $1,000 today,

37
00:01:33,176 --> 00:01:35,887
<i>But Marky's idea was very different.</i>

38
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:38,306
Three days before the event,
I'm going to take the explosive

39
00:01:38,389 --> 00:01:39,432
and hide in the podium...

40
00:01:39,516 --> 00:01:43,061
<i>...and he had planned an act</i>
<i>of glittery social protest</i>

41
00:01:43,394 --> 00:01:46,314
You're going to knock on the podium door.
Let me know the coast is clear.

42
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:47,941
When Love steps up to the podium

43
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:49,734
at exactly eight o'clock, blam!

44
00:01:49,818 --> 00:01:51,569
Thing is, I can't find
the glitter anywhere...

45
00:01:51,653 --> 00:01:53,696
<i>But Lindsey had only signed on</i>
<i>to the project</i>

46
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:56,574
because she was mad at her mother,
Lucille.

47
00:01:57,117 --> 00:01:58,993
"From Gangie for Facelift."
Mother.

48
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:00,537
<i>...over what she assumed her mother</i>

49
00:02:00,703 --> 00:02:02,413
<i>had sent her daughter Maeby:</i>

50
00:02:02,539 --> 00:02:04,374
<i>a check for plastic surgery.</i>

51
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:06,876
What makes you think I wrote a check
to your daughter?

52
00:02:07,043 --> 00:02:09,295
<i>In fact, it was Maeby's royalty check</i>

53
00:02:09,462 --> 00:02:10,839
<i>for this film.</i>

54
00:02:11,005 --> 00:02:13,842
<i>But when she revealed she was</i>
<i>living in the penthouse...</i>

55
00:02:14,008 --> 00:02:17,011
The apple does not
far from the tree fall.

56
00:02:17,178 --> 00:02:18,680
<i>Lindsay felt she needed to prove...</i>

57
00:02:18,763 --> 00:02:20,557
I am like you nothing.

58
00:02:20,723 --> 00:02:22,517
I am a political activist.

59
00:02:22,767 --> 00:02:24,102
<i>...which is why she decided...</i>

60
00:02:25,395 --> 00:02:26,229
I'm in.

61
00:02:26,437 --> 00:02:28,648
-Let's bomb the bastard.
-Yes!

62
00:02:28,731 --> 00:02:30,567
<i>but as she pulled up to the hotel,</i>

63
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:31,985
<i>her stridency was waning</i>

64
00:02:32,068 --> 00:02:33,862
Look, um...

65
00:02:33,945 --> 00:02:36,656
I have this check that my mother
wrote for my daughter...

66
00:02:37,198 --> 00:02:39,534
It can buy us a lot of leaflets
against Love.

67
00:02:39,784 --> 00:02:41,786
And also a lot of Nature's Miracle.

68
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:43,955
You know there's a huge sale
going on at Petco.

69
00:02:44,038 --> 00:02:46,082
No, never. Rip it up. No money.

70
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:48,042
Don't worry. I've thought of everything.

71
00:02:48,293 --> 00:02:49,210
<i>He had.</i>

72
00:02:49,294 --> 00:02:50,753
Except for someone to watch Cindy.

73
00:02:51,713 --> 00:02:53,756
But she's locked in.
What's the worst that can happen?

74
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,593
<i>As it turned out, she wouldn't be</i>
<i>locked in for long...</i>

75
00:02:56,968 --> 00:02:59,679
<i>...as Maeby would let the ostrich</i>
<i>in heat out</i>

76
00:02:59,929 --> 00:03:01,764
<i>while looking for the very check Marky</i>

77
00:03:01,931 --> 00:03:03,766
<i>had told Lindsay to rip up.</i>

78
00:03:03,892 --> 00:03:04,726
No money.

79
00:03:04,809 --> 00:03:06,978
<i>...before going to squat in a podium</i>
<i>for three days.</i>

80
00:03:07,061 --> 00:03:08,563
What a great day to step out

81
00:03:08,646 --> 00:03:10,023
onto an over-irrigated golf course

82
00:03:10,106 --> 00:03:12,192
and play a game that wastes
vast acres

83
00:03:12,358 --> 00:03:13,943
of usable, farmable land.

84
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:16,154
<i>And while she didn't find the check</i>

85
00:03:16,487 --> 00:03:18,323
<i>she did find an invitation</i>
<i>to an award show</i>

86
00:03:18,489 --> 00:03:20,283
<i>that honored young Hollywood.</i>

87
00:03:20,366 --> 00:03:21,326
I'm getting an Opie?

88
00:03:21,492 --> 00:03:24,037
<i>The only bigger honor</i>
<i>would be having an award like that</i>

89
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,039
<i>named after you, I guess.</i>

90
00:03:26,789 --> 00:03:29,125
<i>But it was an important morale-booster,</i>

91
00:03:29,292 --> 00:03:33,171
<i>as she was jealous of her</i>
<i>cousin George Michael's accomplishments</i>

92
00:03:33,338 --> 00:03:35,924
<i>-as a college senior.</i>
-Have you told her about your software?

93
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:38,927
So, it's privacy software
that's also anti-piracy?

94
00:03:39,093 --> 00:03:39,969
Thanks, yeah.

95
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,304
<i>It was neither.</i>

96
00:03:41,596 --> 00:03:43,514
<i>In fact, it was actually this...</i>

97
00:03:43,681 --> 00:03:45,141
...programmers call "hacker traps."

98
00:03:45,808 --> 00:03:47,727
which uses false meta data...

99
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:49,354
<i>...a fake woodblock app...</i>

100
00:03:50,021 --> 00:03:51,231
<i>But George Michael could see</i>

101
00:03:51,397 --> 00:03:52,690
<i>he was impressing her</i>

102
00:03:52,857 --> 00:03:54,067
<i>so he continued the lie...</i>

103
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:55,109
It's called Fakeblock.

104
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:56,527
<i>Plus, he wanted to expose her</i>

105
00:03:56,694 --> 00:03:59,364
<i>to his newly overtly sexual persona.</i>

106
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:01,032
Just trying to be those guys.

107
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:03,618
<i>That's how George Michael</i>
<i>came to make his move.</i>

108
00:04:03,785 --> 00:04:05,119
Are you gonna come by
on Thursday?

109
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:08,039
I don't think so.
I have this thing in L.A.

110
00:04:08,206 --> 00:04:09,249
Can you blow it off?

111
00:04:09,332 --> 00:04:11,042
You might want to get
graduating high school

112
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:12,210
out of the way.

113
00:04:12,293 --> 00:04:15,463
I'm getting a Lifetime Achievement Award
at this gala.

114
00:04:15,546 --> 00:04:17,632
Might want to get that
out of the way too, I guess.

115
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:20,593
You want me to go with you to that?

116
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:22,637
I could pick you up at your place.

117
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,056
They're actually shooting a thing
at my place.

118
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:26,015
{\an8}<i>As it turns out,</i>

119
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:28,351
<i>they'd end up just clubbing a Thing.</i>

120
00:04:28,768 --> 00:04:30,770
Yeah, that might actually be a good idea,

121
00:04:30,853 --> 00:04:33,773
because I can't bring my friends
without permission from their parents.

122
00:04:33,856 --> 00:04:36,567
<i>With the exception</i>
<i>of her boyfriend, Perfecto,</i>

123
00:04:36,651 --> 00:04:38,403
<i>about whom she recently discovered...</i>

124
00:04:38,569 --> 00:04:39,404
He's a cop.

125
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:42,365
<i>Maeby realized she needed</i>
<i>to get something incriminating</i>

126
00:04:42,532 --> 00:04:43,366
<i>on Perfecto</i>

127
00:04:43,533 --> 00:04:45,952
<i>before he could get her</i>
<i>kicked out of school.</i>

128
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:47,453
<i>But she was soon to learn.</i>

129
00:04:47,537 --> 00:04:50,081
<i>that her grades might beat him to it.</i>

130
00:04:50,248 --> 00:04:51,082
I got you tacos.

131
00:04:51,249 --> 00:04:52,333
I hope that's okay,

132
00:04:52,417 --> 00:04:54,252
because you're gonna sit here and study.

133
00:04:54,335 --> 00:04:55,503
No, I can't.

134
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:58,214
Young lady, you better pull it together,

135
00:04:58,381 --> 00:04:59,632
or you're not going to graduate.

136
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:00,842
Are you on drugs?

137
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:02,385
Because from what I hear,

138
00:05:02,552 --> 00:05:04,595
there might be an undercover cop
at this school.

139
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:07,432
How long do you wanna stay in high school?

140
00:05:07,515 --> 00:05:08,349
You're 17.

141
00:05:08,558 --> 00:05:10,852
<i>And that's when she remembered</i>
<i>that Perfecto thought</i>

142
00:05:11,019 --> 00:05:12,270
<i>she was 17 too.</i>

143
00:05:12,437 --> 00:05:14,856
You know what? I think I will do better

144
00:05:14,939 --> 00:05:16,441
once I get a little Mexican in me.

145
00:05:16,607 --> 00:05:18,818
<i>Maeby and Perfecto weren't the only ones</i>

146
00:05:18,901 --> 00:05:20,862
<i>acting younger than they really were.</i>

147
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:23,781
<i>And in an effort to impress</i>
<i>the young entourage</i>

148
00:05:23,948 --> 00:05:26,034
<i>that was growing weary of his act,</i>

149
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,786
<i>Gob stopped in front of a club</i>
<i>to pick up some women.</i>

150
00:05:30,621 --> 00:05:32,790
<i>And so the night before Mark Cherry</i>

151
00:05:32,957 --> 00:05:35,168
<i>was also due to be honored</i>
<i>at the Opies,</i>

152
00:05:35,418 --> 00:05:37,337
<i>the gang from the Malibu Colony</i>

153
00:05:37,503 --> 00:05:40,214
<i>met the gang from Gob's bee colony.</i>

154
00:05:40,465 --> 00:05:42,884
I'm like, "Those are police boats..."

155
00:05:42,967 --> 00:05:45,261
So everybody's running around...

156
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:48,765
<i>To the entourage,</i>
<i>the evening was a complete disaster.</i>

157
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:51,768
<i>Drunken, sick and covered with bee stings,</i>

158
00:05:51,934 --> 00:05:53,895
<i>they had truly hit bottom.</i>

159
00:05:55,271 --> 00:05:57,482
<i>But to the man they called Getaway,</i>

160
00:05:57,648 --> 00:05:59,359
<i>it was an amazing night,</i>

161
00:05:59,942 --> 00:06:01,903
<i>and he couldn't wait to forget it.</i>

162
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:05,031
Fun day.

163
00:06:28,679 --> 00:06:29,514
Fun night.

164
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:32,600
<i>Now the story of what happened</i>

165
00:06:32,767 --> 00:06:33,851
{\an8}<i>when the one man</i>

166
00:06:34,018 --> 00:06:36,104
{\an8}<i>who was holding his family</i>
<i>together</i>

167
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:37,688
<i>finally let go,</i>

168
00:06:38,147 --> 00:06:39,524
<i>and the separate journeys</i>

169
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:41,692
<i>that eventually gave them no choice,</i>

170
00:06:41,859 --> 00:06:43,069
<i>but to come back together.</i>

171
00:06:43,486 --> 00:06:46,697
{\an8}<i>It's </i>Arrested Development:
Fateful Consequences.

172
00:06:53,454 --> 00:06:54,789
<i>On the day of the Opies,</i>

173
00:06:54,956 --> 00:06:58,084
{\an8}<i>Gob headed out to make sure</i>
<i>everything was in order,</i>

174
00:06:58,251 --> 00:07:01,254
{\an8}<i>trying not to arouse the gang</i>
<i>he felt he'd won back,</i>

175
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:04,298
{\an8}<i>with what he dimly recalled</i>
<i>to be a fun night.</i>

176
00:07:04,382 --> 00:07:05,258
Wake up!

177
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:08,469
<i>And that night, a softening George Sr.</i>

178
00:07:08,636 --> 00:07:11,889
<i>arrived to meet the candidate</i>
<i>Herbert Love at his rally.</i>

179
00:07:12,056 --> 00:07:13,850
{\an8}So... tender.

180
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:17,103
{\an8}<i>At the same hotel that was hosting</i>

181
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:19,188
{\an8}<i>Young Hollywood's Opie Awards.</i>

182
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:21,023
{\an8}[crowd laughing]

183
00:07:25,736 --> 00:07:27,905
{\an8}It's really nice to be
out with you as adults.

184
00:07:28,072 --> 00:07:30,575
In Spain they don't even
eat dinner until after 11 p.m.

185
00:07:30,658 --> 00:07:34,370
{\an8}I'm going to mingle with 13-year-olds
who think they still play fifth grade.

186
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:35,955
{\an8}<i>And, as he told himself,</i>

187
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:37,582
<i>it was okay to unleash</i>

188
00:07:37,665 --> 00:07:39,333
{\an8}<i>his overtly sexual persona</i>

189
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:40,334
{\an8}<i>on his cousin...</i>

190
00:07:40,418 --> 00:07:41,627
Gentlemen, start your engines.

191
00:07:41,711 --> 00:07:43,754
<i>...he inadvertently ogled his aunt,</i>

192
00:07:43,921 --> 00:07:45,423
<i>who'd arrived in disguise.</i>

193
00:07:46,007 --> 00:07:49,385
<i>And Maeby ran into her</i>
<i>old studio boss, Mort Meyers.</i>

194
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:52,096
{\an8}I'm actually getting
the Lifetime Achievement Opie tonight.

195
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:53,389
I'm very sorry.

196
00:07:54,765 --> 00:07:57,310
{\an8}They only give that award away
to somebody after they die

197
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:59,645
{\an8}or, even worse, after your career's dead.

198
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:00,771
{\an8}Really?

199
00:08:01,063 --> 00:08:02,440
{\an8}Consider yourself lucky...

200
00:08:02,607 --> 00:08:04,650
They told you your career was over.

201
00:08:04,817 --> 00:08:07,653
{\an8}I didn't find out until I was locked out
of my office.

202
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:09,572
{\an8}I passed on <i>Hunger Games.</i>

203
00:08:10,031 --> 00:08:11,616
{\an8}It wasn't the most graceful of exits.

204
00:08:11,782 --> 00:08:13,242
That's the way the cookie crumbles.

205
00:08:13,409 --> 00:08:14,410
This is for you.

206
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:15,912
Thanks, man.

207
00:08:17,622 --> 00:08:19,665
Actually, the exit was pretty graceful.

208
00:08:19,832 --> 00:08:21,292
I think I just remember it that way

209
00:08:21,459 --> 00:08:23,628
{\an8}because it got dicey when I was
sneaking back in

210
00:08:23,794 --> 00:08:25,338
{\an8}to take a [bleep] on Sid's desk.

211
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:34,805
{\an8}But do what I do.
When they kick you out of the business,

212
00:08:34,889 --> 00:08:38,351
{\an8}save face by starting
your own internet company.

213
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:40,144
You started an internet company?

214
00:08:40,228 --> 00:08:41,145
It's the real deal.

215
00:08:41,312 --> 00:08:42,855
It's a system that automates provision--

216
00:08:43,064 --> 00:08:44,482
<i>And, once again, she found herself</i>

217
00:08:44,649 --> 00:08:47,318
<i>with someone who had not</i>
<i>only moved on with their life,</i>

218
00:08:47,485 --> 00:08:50,238
<i>but done so in ways</i>
<i>she couldn't understand.</i>

219
00:08:50,321 --> 00:08:52,532
...overseas financial transactions.
It's called Schnoodle.

220
00:08:52,615 --> 00:08:55,660
-Schnoodle.
<i>-It was a busy night at the hotel.</i>

221
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:58,621
{\an8}Take a hat. We got 18,000 of them.

222
00:08:58,829 --> 00:09:00,748
{\an8}<i>And as Maeby put on a brave face...</i>

223
00:09:01,624 --> 00:09:03,626
{\an8}<i>George Sr. put on a braver one.</i>

224
00:09:03,793 --> 00:09:05,586
{\an8}I just think there'll be lot of support

225
00:09:05,753 --> 00:09:07,213
flowing in this relationship.

226
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:08,214
And your base...

227
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:10,091
You got a point behind
all those teeth?

228
00:09:11,092 --> 00:09:13,427
If you support the wall,
I'll give you a piece of the action

229
00:09:13,511 --> 00:09:14,637
-Action?
-Yeah.

230
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,264
-Action Jackson?
-Yes, sir.

231
00:09:16,347 --> 00:09:18,140
Do I look like Carl Weathers to you?

232
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:19,100
{\an8}No, no.

233
00:09:19,267 --> 00:09:21,978
{\an8}Do I look like someone
who eats at CW Swappigan's?

234
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:23,563
I don't want to be the one to say it,

235
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:26,274
but I happen to be fond of
redheads and greenbacks.

236
00:09:26,816 --> 00:09:27,984
<i>George Sr, had neither.</i>

237
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:29,318
How would you like both?

238
00:09:31,779 --> 00:09:33,239
<i>Buenas noches...</i>

239
00:09:33,531 --> 00:09:34,782
I will be needing a room...

240
00:09:34,865 --> 00:09:35,950
-How many nights?
-Two.

241
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:38,911
No, just one night.
I thought you were saying people.

242
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:40,830
-And how many beds?
-Two.

243
00:09:41,831 --> 00:09:43,416
No, one bed...

244
00:09:43,499 --> 00:09:45,543
Why give her the option?
Keep itn real simple.

245
00:09:45,626 --> 00:09:48,087
One bed, one night, two people
that's solved for X.

246
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:50,715
I hate Young Hollywood.

247
00:09:50,881 --> 00:09:53,467
<i>Maeby soon ran into an actress she knew...</i>

248
00:09:54,135 --> 00:09:57,054
<i>from the time before that actress</i>
<i>cleaned up her act.</i>

249
00:09:57,221 --> 00:09:59,223
Next time, don't pocket it.

250
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:00,224
Pay for it.

251
00:10:00,391 --> 00:10:02,476
<i>♪ I mean come on ♪</i>

252
00:10:03,144 --> 00:10:05,438
And you're getting the Lifetime
Achievement Award?

253
00:10:05,521 --> 00:10:08,274
You want me to play
the bagpipes at your funeral?

254
00:10:08,357 --> 00:10:10,067
You know, I can laugh about it,

255
00:10:10,151 --> 00:10:11,902
because I'm actually on the upswing.

256
00:10:12,069 --> 00:10:13,321
I was just telling Mort here...

257
00:10:13,529 --> 00:10:15,698
that I've actually started
my own internet company.

258
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:17,450
I was just about to tell you.

259
00:10:17,533 --> 00:10:19,076
-How do we know each other?
-We don't.

260
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,578
That's what it is.

261
00:10:20,661 --> 00:10:22,705
Schnoodle's dead. Fakeblock
is the next big thing.

262
00:10:22,788 --> 00:10:24,874
{\an8}<i>But George Michael was</i>
<i>surprised to hear Maeby</i>

263
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:26,417
{\an8}<i>talking about a software.</i>

264
00:10:26,584 --> 00:10:27,460
...called Fakeblock.

265
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:29,295
What's this?
You're talking about Fakeblock?

266
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:31,130
Yes, your privacy software.

267
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:32,506
<i>...that didn't exist.</i>

268
00:10:32,673 --> 00:10:35,468
-How does your privacy software work?
-It's private.

269
00:10:35,801 --> 00:10:37,511
Can I talk to you for a second, please?

270
00:10:37,595 --> 00:10:39,263
I don't want people to know
I'm doing this.

271
00:10:39,347 --> 00:10:41,057
Everybody has to know about this, okay?

272
00:10:41,265 --> 00:10:42,391
This could be big for me.

273
00:10:42,558 --> 00:10:44,310
I could make Fakeblock huge.

274
00:10:45,227 --> 00:10:46,395
Maeby, there is no company.

275
00:10:46,562 --> 00:10:48,898
Fakeblock is just a software
that I'm developing.

276
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:50,816
And the whole point is that it's private.

277
00:10:51,192 --> 00:10:52,860
So you can't
be telling people about it.

278
00:10:53,027 --> 00:10:54,654
We've got to tell people about it.

279
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:56,447
I just got a Lifetime Achievement Award.

280
00:10:56,781 --> 00:10:57,698
I'm finished.

281
00:10:57,948 --> 00:11:01,118
And also, I think you should consider
calling it The Fake Block.

282
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:04,372
-It's cleaner, like "the Netflix."
-It's just not ready.

283
00:11:04,622 --> 00:11:06,624
There's still a bunch
of programming problems.

284
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:08,668
You can get it ready, George Michael.

285
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:09,752
Think they invite animals

286
00:11:09,835 --> 00:11:11,587
and ask 'em to wait
while they build the zoo?

287
00:11:12,129 --> 00:11:13,589
No, that would be a bloodbath.

288
00:11:13,756 --> 00:11:15,758
Yeah, a total [bleep] bloodbath.

289
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:18,344
-We have no money to start a business.
-Don't worry.

290
00:11:18,469 --> 00:11:20,346
I'll get the ball rolling
with free publicity

291
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:21,597
when I accept my award.

292
00:11:21,806 --> 00:11:23,933
Come on, this could be my only chance
to be a "hairess."

293
00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:25,101
A "hairess"?

294
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:27,061
You can still be the boss, okay?

295
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:29,689
Just don't want people to know
I'm working with my cousin.

296
00:11:29,772 --> 00:11:31,232
So you are not my cousin.

297
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:33,442
You are not George Michael Bluth.

298
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:35,361
I'm great with that.

299
00:11:35,653 --> 00:11:38,072
In fact, you know what
might really help us sell it...

300
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:40,908
Oh, heiress!
You don't pronounce the "h."

301
00:11:40,991 --> 00:11:43,202
-And that's not what heiress means.
-I pronounce the "h."

302
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:44,578
But that's not how the word--

303
00:11:44,662 --> 00:11:46,706
We say words the way we say them
for a reason...

304
00:11:46,789 --> 00:11:48,040
So, what is this?

305
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:50,584
Is this another one of these
social networking things?

306
00:11:50,751 --> 00:11:52,253
Because I am so over those.

307
00:11:52,628 --> 00:11:55,005
I tried to deactivate my Facebook profile.

308
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:57,174
It's easier to get out of Scientology.

309
00:11:57,883 --> 00:11:59,969
Well, this is actually the opposite
of Facebook.

310
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:01,721
It's the anti-social network.

311
00:12:01,804 --> 00:12:03,556
It prevents piracy. Right?

312
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:04,557
Really?

313
00:12:06,142 --> 00:12:06,976
Rebel Alley.

314
00:12:07,184 --> 00:12:08,686
George Mi-hairess.

315
00:12:09,478 --> 00:12:10,438
George Maharis.

316
00:12:10,604 --> 00:12:13,023
<i>And that's how George Michael</i>
<i>finally got himself</i>

317
00:12:13,107 --> 00:12:13,941
<i>a new name.</i>

318
00:12:15,776 --> 00:12:18,112
<i>Strong, rugged... untainted.</i>

319
00:12:18,195 --> 00:12:19,655
Yes, George Maharis.

320
00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:21,031
Perfecto.

321
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:22,616
<i>De nada.</i>

322
00:12:23,284 --> 00:12:24,744
That's my undercover cop boyfriend.

323
00:12:25,619 --> 00:12:26,746
I'm trying to get him in bed.

324
00:12:27,329 --> 00:12:28,205
Boyfriend?

325
00:12:29,623 --> 00:12:31,542
So funny that didn't come up in the car.

326
00:12:36,338 --> 00:12:38,340
<i>George Michael had just discovered</i>

327
00:12:38,507 --> 00:12:39,884
<i>that Maeby had a boyfriend.</i>

328
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:41,177
So, how does it work?

329
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:43,262
How does what work?

330
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:44,972
Your privacy software.

331
00:12:45,473 --> 00:12:47,266
How does it protect you from piracy?

332
00:12:49,351 --> 00:12:50,227
I don't know.

333
00:12:51,103 --> 00:12:51,937
Don't worry about it.

334
00:12:52,188 --> 00:12:54,148
No, you really piqued my interest.

335
00:12:55,399 --> 00:12:56,233
I'm sorry.

336
00:12:56,358 --> 00:12:58,944
<i>But some women don't forget</i>
<i>being told no.</i>

337
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:01,238
<i>Marion Ross comes to mind.</i>

338
00:13:01,989 --> 00:13:03,240
<i>And Maeby set to work</i>

339
00:13:03,407 --> 00:13:05,242
<i>entrapping this local predator.</i>

340
00:13:05,409 --> 00:13:06,368
I know why you're here.

341
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:08,037
Promise you won't tell anyone at school.

342
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:10,164
I'm just a huge fan of teen stars.

343
00:13:10,331 --> 00:13:11,999
Yeah. Very convincing.

344
00:13:12,082 --> 00:13:14,001
You're a better actor
than most of the kids here.

345
00:13:14,084 --> 00:13:15,127
Even Zack and Cody.

346
00:13:15,211 --> 00:13:16,504
Are they here?

347
00:13:16,587 --> 00:13:18,255
I thought they were filming
a movie in Maui.

348
00:13:18,339 --> 00:13:21,675
Look, I may only be 17, Perfecto,
but I know you're a cop.

349
00:13:22,343 --> 00:13:23,677
There's that cop stare.

350
00:13:23,844 --> 00:13:24,804
I got to tell you...

351
00:13:25,429 --> 00:13:26,263
I find it very sexy.

352
00:13:27,515 --> 00:13:28,390
Okay,

353
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:31,393
I'm a cop.

354
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:32,561
I'm working here undercover.

355
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:35,105
We're hunting down an ex-CIA operative
named Estevez,

356
00:13:35,272 --> 00:13:36,398
who's gone rogue--

357
00:13:36,607 --> 00:13:37,900
It's the kids from <i>Modern Family.</i>

358
00:13:39,401 --> 00:13:40,528
He's become a drug kingpin

359
00:13:40,694 --> 00:13:41,987
and his son goes to Newport.

360
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:45,241
There's something going down tonight
or possibly even at Cinco-- [yells] Rico!

361
00:13:45,991 --> 00:13:47,493
Wow, you are good.

362
00:13:47,785 --> 00:13:48,619
I have to be.

363
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:50,079
Our lives depend on it.

364
00:13:51,914 --> 00:13:52,998
To be continued.

365
00:13:53,082 --> 00:13:54,124
You better believe it.

366
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:56,335
Rico!

367
00:13:56,418 --> 00:13:59,171
<i>But George Sr. was far from </i>rico<i> himself,</i>

368
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:02,883
<i>despite promising Herbert Love</i>
<i>he had money.</i>

369
00:14:03,801 --> 00:14:05,511
But at least he could go home.

370
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:07,847
<i>with some coconut shrimp.</i>

371
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:11,183
I should have known you'd be here.

372
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:13,978
supporting this right-wing,
 dangerous crack-pot.

373
00:14:14,061 --> 00:14:17,898
Lindsay, I forgot. You dyed your hair.

374
00:14:17,982 --> 00:14:18,941
What are you doing here?

375
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:20,568
I'm supporting Love as well.

376
00:14:21,235 --> 00:14:22,361
We're both doing that.

377
00:14:22,444 --> 00:14:24,822
Oh honey, I wanted to contact you

378
00:14:24,905 --> 00:14:27,408
every single day since last May.

379
00:14:27,825 --> 00:14:29,618
I haven't seen you since January.

380
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:32,037
Yeah, the first four months,
I was in denial.

381
00:14:32,204 --> 00:14:33,038
How are you?

382
00:14:33,163 --> 00:14:34,331
Are you good?

383
00:14:34,498 --> 00:14:35,583
Do you have any money?

384
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:37,877
Not really.

385
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:41,547
Except for a $50,000 check

386
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:44,049
your wife sent to my daughter
for plastic surgery.

387
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:46,844
What kind of woman does that?

388
00:14:47,011 --> 00:14:48,888
I thought there was no money left.

389
00:14:48,971 --> 00:14:49,847
Oh no.

390
00:14:51,348 --> 00:14:52,224
That's awful.

391
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:54,226
She's just precious the way she is.

392
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:55,561
Does Maizie even know?

393
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:56,562
Her name is Maeby.

394
00:14:57,605 --> 00:14:59,398
You don't think "Maizie" is cuter?

395
00:14:59,481 --> 00:15:01,525
You know what I want to do?
I want to take this...

396
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:05,029
and I want to deposit it
in a trust fund...

397
00:15:05,112 --> 00:15:08,866
that she can't open until she's 21.

398
00:15:08,949 --> 00:15:10,492
<i>She was 22 at the time.</i>

399
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:11,952
I guess I can't use it anyway.

400
00:15:12,119 --> 00:15:13,078
Are you kidding me?

401
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:15,664
You are the most beautiful little girl.

402
00:15:16,332 --> 00:15:18,083
If you have any more work,

403
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:19,835
your cartilage is going to collapse.

404
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:20,794
Let me see if I can...

405
00:15:21,378 --> 00:15:22,254
There you go.

406
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:24,632
<i>And that's when George Sr...</i>

407
00:15:24,715 --> 00:15:25,674
Got the check.

408
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:27,301
<i>...finally tipped a black man.</i>

409
00:15:30,012 --> 00:15:30,888
Man...

410
00:15:31,221 --> 00:15:34,016
I am going to put this on my wall.

411
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:37,436
<i>It was then that Lindsay</i>
<i>ran into a daughter,</i>

412
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:40,731
<i>whose $50,000 check she'd just given away</i>

413
00:15:40,814 --> 00:15:42,566
<i>stealing some coconut shrimp.</i>

414
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:45,069
Of course you're here.
I should have known you'd be supporting

415
00:15:45,152 --> 00:15:46,612
this right-wing, dangerous crack pot.

416
00:15:46,695 --> 00:15:48,739
No, I am here undercover

417
00:15:48,822 --> 00:15:49,823
with my boyfriend.

418
00:15:49,907 --> 00:15:51,659
We are going to take down Love

419
00:15:51,742 --> 00:15:54,662
with a random act of senseless
non-violence.

420
00:15:55,412 --> 00:15:57,456
<i>Maeby felt a foreign feeling.</i>

421
00:15:57,539 --> 00:15:59,500
I actually<i> </i>respect that.

422
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:00,668
Thank you, Maeby.

423
00:16:00,751 --> 00:16:03,379
<i>Which is why, for the first time</i>
<i>in her adult life...</i>

424
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:04,838
So, what are you doing here?

425
00:16:04,922 --> 00:16:07,424
<i>Maeby was totally honest with her mother.</i>

426
00:16:07,841 --> 00:16:09,510
I'm getting a Lifetime Achievement Award

427
00:16:09,593 --> 00:16:11,553
for my work in the entertainment business.

428
00:16:12,262 --> 00:16:13,097
I tried.

429
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:14,723
Tell your therapist I tried.

430
00:16:16,517 --> 00:16:17,559
I'm not in therapy.

431
00:16:17,726 --> 00:16:19,436
Then I must have done something right.

432
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:22,356
<i>And soon she was saying</i>
<i>farewell to Hollywood</i>

433
00:16:22,439 --> 00:16:24,984
<i>in a way she hoped they'd remember.</i>

434
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:26,193
Thank you, Kirk Cameron,

435
00:16:26,276 --> 00:16:28,404
for that incredibly Bible-y introduction.

436
00:16:29,196 --> 00:16:31,281
Okay, tie yourself to your chair,

437
00:16:31,365 --> 00:16:33,617
because this is
going to be a rough [bleep] ride.

438
00:16:33,701 --> 00:16:36,120
I'm leaving this [bleep], dying business,

439
00:16:36,286 --> 00:16:37,746
to join the software game.

440
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:39,540
Double [bleep] news flash.

441
00:16:39,623 --> 00:16:41,083
I'm starting Fakeblock...

442
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:42,251
with George Maharis,

443
00:16:42,334 --> 00:16:44,378
the world's first anti-social network.

444
00:16:44,461 --> 00:16:47,548
So you can take this Opie and shove it up
your [bleep],

445
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:49,466
because I will [bleep]

446
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:50,718
the next goddamn [bleep]

447
00:16:50,801 --> 00:16:52,052
who tells me I'm finished.

448
00:16:52,136 --> 00:16:53,178
You [bleep].

449
00:16:53,262 --> 00:16:54,638
You can all go [bleep] yourselves.

450
00:16:54,722 --> 00:16:56,140
What? Sure.

451
00:16:57,641 --> 00:17:00,561
Please welcome the talented voices
of <i>Phineas and Ferb.</i>

452
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:02,730
Go [bleep] yourself.

453
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:05,357
[bleep] you!

454
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:07,776
<i>Meanwhile, Gob had arrived back stage</i>

455
00:17:07,943 --> 00:17:10,988
<i>and was doing some advanced recon</i>
<i>for Mark Cherry...</i>

456
00:17:11,071 --> 00:17:14,742
-Where's the cocounut shrimp?
<i>-...before his scheduled performance.</i>

457
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:17,578
Especially if they could get it
with a bit of...

458
00:17:17,661 --> 00:17:20,164
<i>It was then that Gob noticed</i>

459
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:22,708
<i>the presence of a competitor</i>
<i>from his past.</i>

460
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:24,168
Tony Wonder.

461
00:17:24,251 --> 00:17:25,377
That lousy, failed magician.

462
00:17:26,378 --> 00:17:28,672
<i>Gob realized that where there was glitter</i>

463
00:17:28,756 --> 00:17:31,258
<i>there must also be Tony Wonder,</i>

464
00:17:31,842 --> 00:17:34,511
<i>waiting to make his magical re-appearance</i>

465
00:17:35,554 --> 00:17:37,139
<i>so he decided to take advantage</i>

466
00:17:37,222 --> 00:17:38,974
<i>of an unexpected diversion</i>

467
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:42,352
<i>and have a little fun by</i>
<i>wedging shut a panel on the podium</i>

468
00:17:42,436 --> 00:17:44,980
<i>he knew Tony Wonder would pop out of.</i>

469
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:47,649
You guys wanna see
a real failed magician?

470
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:49,109
Get down to the Opies tonight.

471
00:17:49,193 --> 00:17:50,861
It's gonna be hysterical.

472
00:17:50,944 --> 00:17:54,073
<i>But, while Gob dimly remembered</i>
<i>the fun night,</i>

473
00:17:54,156 --> 00:17:57,117
<i>he'd completely forgotten</i>
<i>the seven ambulances</i>

474
00:17:57,284 --> 00:17:59,536
<i>that had arrived after Josh Abramson</i>

475
00:17:59,703 --> 00:18:02,247
<i>had swung by to pick up</i>
<i>an old computer.</i>

476
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,835
[Josh] <i>One of them is Mark Cherry.</i>
<i>He's a singer.</i>

477
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:08,754
[woman] <i>Calm down. How many ambulances?</i>

478
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:11,548
[Josh] <i>Five, ten. Maybe seven at least.</i>

479
00:18:12,174 --> 00:18:14,718
[narrator]
<i>That's how Gob found out his colony...</i>

480
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:16,804
<i>had checked into rehab.</i>

481
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:19,056
Come on, you guys.
It's just...

482
00:18:19,139 --> 00:18:22,142
a little alcohol poisoning
never killed anyone.

483
00:18:22,309 --> 00:18:24,645
<i>Actually, alcohol poisoning is responsible</i>

484
00:18:24,728 --> 00:18:26,605
<i>for over four thousand deaths a year.</i>

485
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:28,440
"Binge-drinking." Not cool.

486
00:18:28,607 --> 00:18:30,609
<i>♪ I mean come on ♪</i>

487
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,319
Well.That's a drag.

488
00:18:32,402 --> 00:18:33,570
I thought we were friends.

489
00:18:33,737 --> 00:18:35,114
<i>But, of course, they weren't.</i>

490
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:39,827
<i>And that's when he saw Tony Wonder.</i>

491
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:41,745
[Tony] I'm here and I'm queer...

492
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:44,873
<i>...come out of a speaker.</i>

493
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:46,583
And now I'm in a speaker.

494
00:18:46,667 --> 00:18:48,585
No one can stop us.

495
00:18:49,169 --> 00:18:50,045
Wait, if...

496
00:18:50,879 --> 00:18:53,382
If Wonder wasn't in the... podium,
then who's...

497
00:18:54,007 --> 00:18:55,425
<i>It was Marky, of course.</i>

498
00:18:56,218 --> 00:18:58,137
{\an8}<i>But moments earlier, and realizing</i>

499
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:01,014
<i>it was still too early to let him</i>
<i>out of the podium...</i>

500
00:19:01,181 --> 00:19:03,058
<i>Lindsay headed to the bar</i>

501
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:05,519
<i>and was suddenly face-to-face</i>

502
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:06,520
<i>with Herbert Love...</i>

503
00:19:06,603 --> 00:19:08,438
...are we the only two people
who don't fit in

504
00:19:08,605 --> 00:19:10,566
with all these Orange County phonies?

505
00:19:12,109 --> 00:19:14,278
<i>...and had no idea who he was.</i>

506
00:19:14,695 --> 00:19:15,988
They are a bunch of phonies.

507
00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:18,365
I usually don't even go to these things.

508
00:19:18,448 --> 00:19:19,616
<i>And perhaps it was because</i>

509
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:21,785
<i>he reminded her so much of Tobias</i>

510
00:19:21,869 --> 00:19:23,745
<i>when they first started dating,</i>

511
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:25,372
<i>that Lindsay flirted back.</i>

512
00:19:25,455 --> 00:19:29,001
-What's your name, princess?
-Cindy Feather...bottom.

513
00:19:29,084 --> 00:19:31,378
Of the Laguna Beach Featherbottoms?

514
00:19:31,461 --> 00:19:33,172
Are you trying to find out where I live?

515
00:19:33,255 --> 00:19:35,841
And your favorite kind of jewelry.

516
00:19:35,924 --> 00:19:38,510
<i>Lindsay hadn't heard the word jewelry</i>
<i>in a long time,</i>

517
00:19:38,594 --> 00:19:40,679
<i>but tried to stay strong.</i>

518
00:19:40,762 --> 00:19:42,973
How do I know you're not
one of these phonies?

519
00:19:43,056 --> 00:19:45,309
The only phony I'm interested in...

520
00:19:45,392 --> 00:19:47,102
is your phone-y number.

521
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:49,062
And, like Cinderella at the ball...

522
00:19:49,146 --> 00:19:52,774
<i>Lindsay really felt like a princess,</i>
<i>for a change.</i>

523
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:55,194
<i>But also like Cinderella,</i>

524
00:19:55,277 --> 00:19:56,778
<i>she lost track of the time.</i>

525
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:59,198
[explosion]

526
00:20:04,119 --> 00:20:05,787
<i>And that's when she was struck</i>

527
00:20:05,954 --> 00:20:07,915
<i>with an eerie sense of deja vu.</i>

528
00:20:07,998 --> 00:20:08,832
Lindsay!

529
00:20:09,249 --> 00:20:10,083
Oh God.

530
00:20:10,792 --> 00:20:11,835
He blue himself.

531
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:20,886
<i>Lindsay's attempt to create a disaster</i>
<i>for Herbert Love</i>

532
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:22,262
<i>was a complete disaster.</i>

533
00:20:22,429 --> 00:20:24,014
<i>And as she tried to slip away</i>

534
00:20:24,181 --> 00:20:26,141
<i>without drawing attention to herself,</i>

535
00:20:26,308 --> 00:20:28,644
<i>she was once again approached by the man</i>

536
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:30,187
<i>whose name she never got.</i>

537
00:20:31,271 --> 00:20:33,899
Perhaps we can engage
in some sexual congress.

538
00:20:34,316 --> 00:20:36,151
<i>But that's a total give away, right?</i>

539
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:38,403
What a wonderful sense of humor.

540
00:20:39,112 --> 00:20:40,239
I'd like that very much.

541
00:20:41,531 --> 00:20:42,491
Sir, the press awaits.

542
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:45,827
I thought you were sticking it to the man,

543
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:47,788
-not the other way around.
-Maeby.

544
00:20:48,538 --> 00:20:49,831
You think he likes me that way?

545
00:20:50,374 --> 00:20:52,251
No Mom, that's Herbert Love,

546
00:20:52,334 --> 00:20:53,669
the man you're here to protest.

547
00:20:53,752 --> 00:20:56,588
-[Love] ...the guy with the bomb
snuck up from Mexico. That's why I say,

548
00:20:56,755 --> 00:20:59,925
we have to build a wall.

549
00:21:00,676 --> 00:21:01,718
Oh no...

550
00:21:02,302 --> 00:21:04,137
How could you not recognize him?

551
00:21:04,221 --> 00:21:05,722
<i>In fairness to Lindsay,</i>

552
00:21:05,806 --> 00:21:07,557
<i>It was Marky's face-blindness</i>

553
00:21:07,641 --> 00:21:09,184
<i>that led him to mistake this photo</i>

554
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:10,686
<i>for the candidate.</i>

555
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:14,481
<i>Why Lindsay failed to recognize</i>
<i>musical icon Nat King Cole</i>

556
00:21:14,564 --> 00:21:15,899
<i>cannot be explained.</i>

557
00:21:15,983 --> 00:21:17,943
But he's so modern looking.

558
00:21:18,902 --> 00:21:21,780
I didn't know it was the man
whose politics I'm here to protest...

559
00:21:21,863 --> 00:21:23,282
I guess I was just having fun

560
00:21:23,365 --> 00:21:25,117
pretending I had my old life back.

561
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,493
Well, we'll just be friends,

562
00:21:26,576 --> 00:21:29,162
and I'm going to keep it light and fun
and not talk politics at all.

563
00:21:30,247 --> 00:21:31,832
I can't believe you're such a sell-out.

564
00:21:31,915 --> 00:21:33,875
Are you really gonna
whore yourself out like that?

565
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:35,002
I am not a whore.

566
00:21:35,085 --> 00:21:36,878
-Yeah, you're a whore.
-I am not a whore.

567
00:21:36,962 --> 00:21:39,548
I am still committed to my ideals

568
00:21:39,631 --> 00:21:40,549
and to my Marky.

569
00:21:40,632 --> 00:21:41,466
[Marky] Lindsay!

570
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:43,552
Lindsay! Lindsay!

571
00:21:43,635 --> 00:21:45,012
Well, you certainly have a type.

572
00:21:45,095 --> 00:21:47,389
Lindsay? Have you seen
a woman named Lindsay?

573
00:21:47,472 --> 00:21:48,807
If you see a woman named Lindsay,

574
00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:49,933
tell her to bail me out.

575
00:21:51,226 --> 00:21:54,396
-[pitches voice low] I'll do my best, sir.
Thank you.
