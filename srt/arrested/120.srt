1
00:00:01,334 --> 00:00:02,752
narrator: NOW THE STORY

2
00:00:02,752 --> 00:00:04,670
OF A WEALTHY FAMILY 
WHO LOST EVERYTHING

3
00:00:04,670 --> 00:00:06,839
AND THE ONE SON 
WHO HAD NO CHOICE

4
00:00:06,839 --> 00:00:08,716
BUT TO KEEP THEM ALL TOGETHER.

5
00:00:12,970 --> 00:00:15,598
IT'S "ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT."

6
00:00:18,476 --> 00:00:20,103
MICHAEL WAS PREPARING 
FOR A MEETING

7
00:00:20,103 --> 00:00:21,521
WITH THE BLUTH COMPANY BOARD

8
00:00:21,521 --> 00:00:24,357
TO DECIDE WHAT TO DO WITH 
SOME RECENTLY UNFROZEN FUNDS.

9
00:00:24,357 --> 00:00:26,526
- WOW. EXCITING, HUH?

10
00:00:26,526 --> 00:00:28,361
FINALLY GETTING SOME MONEY.

11
00:00:28,361 --> 00:00:29,737
- WHAT DO YOU WANT, LINDSAY?

12
00:00:29,737 --> 00:00:31,364
- I'D LIKE SOME OF THAT MONEY.

13
00:00:31,364 --> 00:00:32,990
- WELL, THIS MONEY IS FOR LAND.

14
00:00:32,990 --> 00:00:34,909
OKAY? WE'RE NOT GONNA BURN 
THROUGH IT

15
00:00:34,909 --> 00:00:36,661
LIKE DAD DID 
WHEN HE WAS IN CHARGE

16
00:00:36,661 --> 00:00:38,413
WITH HIS BAD INVESTMENTS, 
AND HIS CORRUPT DEALINGS--

17
00:00:38,413 --> 00:00:38,871
MOTHER'S NECK.

18
00:00:38,871 --> 00:00:40,331
- NO, THAT WAS 
A GOOD INVESTMENT.

19
00:00:40,331 --> 00:00:42,542
- IT IS EASIER TO LOOK 
AT NOW, ISN'T IT?

20
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:44,377
- WHAT IF I TOLD YOU THAT

21
00:00:44,377 --> 00:00:46,712
THE MONEY WAS FOR SOMETHING 
REALLY WORTHWHILE?

22
00:00:46,712 --> 00:00:48,798
- LIKE WHAT? 
- I WANT TO HAVE AN AFFAIR.

23
00:00:48,798 --> 00:00:50,883
NOW I'M NOT SURE WITH 
WHO YET,

24
00:00:50,883 --> 00:00:53,303
BUT I'LL NEED 
LINGERIE, WAXINGS--

25
00:00:53,303 --> 00:00:55,305
THESE ARE SOME 
REAL COSTS, MICHAEL.

26
00:00:55,305 --> 00:00:57,932
- I TAKE IT THINGS AREN'T 
GETTING BETTER WITH TOBIAS.

27
00:00:57,932 --> 00:00:59,309
- WHAT'S THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

28
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:00,935
narrator: THINGS HADN'T BEEN 
GETTING BETTER

29
00:01:00,935 --> 00:01:02,645
WITH MICHAEL'S SISTER 
AND HER HUSBAND

30
00:01:02,645 --> 00:01:05,523
EVEN AFTER SHE CAME UP WITH 
A PLAN TO GET HIS ATTENTION.

31
00:01:05,523 --> 00:01:06,691
[disco playing] 
- OH, MY GOD.

32
00:01:06,691 --> 00:01:07,650
LISTEN TO THE RADIO.

33
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:10,278
I HAVEN'T HEARD THIS SONG 
SINCE WE FIRST STARTED DATING.

34
00:01:10,278 --> 00:01:13,073
- [singing] BAD GIRLS 
TALKIN' 'BOUT THE SAD GIRLS

35
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:15,158
- I JUST FEEL LIKE 
USING MY BODY.

36
00:01:15,158 --> 00:01:17,493
- WELL, LINDSAY, COULD YOU 
USE IT OVER THERE?

37
00:01:17,493 --> 00:01:19,579
I'M TRYING TO GROW.

38
00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:22,207
- YEAH. IT'S CLEAR 
THAT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN.

39
00:01:22,207 --> 00:01:25,710
WE HAD SEX ONCE IN THE LAST 
YEAR, AND HE JUST LAID THERE.

40
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:27,753
- ALL RIGHT. LOOK, 
THIS MONEY IS FOR LAND.

41
00:01:27,753 --> 00:01:29,755
I'M NOT GONNA GIVE YOU 
MONEY TO HAVE AN AFFAIR.

42
00:01:29,755 --> 00:01:31,132
WHY DON'T YOU PICK 
SOMETHING ELSE

43
00:01:31,132 --> 00:01:32,175
TO BOOST UP 
YOUR SELF-WORTH?

44
00:01:32,175 --> 00:01:33,551
HOW ABOUT, UH, CHARITY?

45
00:01:33,551 --> 00:01:34,969
WHY DON'T YOU GET BACK 
TO YOUR ROOTS?

46
00:01:34,969 --> 00:01:36,762
- WELL, IT HAS BEEN A WHILE.

47
00:01:36,762 --> 00:01:37,930
[inhales sharply] 
ALL RIGHT!

48
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:40,641
I'M GONNA GO DO THAT 
RIGHT NOW.

49
00:01:40,641 --> 00:01:44,103
- YOU'RE GONNA GO GET 
YOUR HAIR DONE, AREN'T YOU?

50
00:01:44,103 --> 00:01:47,064
- WELL, IF I'M GONNA 
HAVE AN AFFAIR--

51
00:01:47,064 --> 00:01:49,024
[phone ringing]

52
00:01:49,024 --> 00:01:52,987
narrator: MICHAEL GOT 
A MESSAGE HE INTENDED TO IGNORE.

53
00:01:52,987 --> 00:01:54,947
UNTIL HE READ THE NEXT LINE.

54
00:01:54,947 --> 00:01:56,449
- A MATTER OF LAND, MOM?

55
00:01:56,449 --> 00:01:58,784
- OH, THAT'S FUNNY.

56
00:01:58,784 --> 00:02:03,456
I MEANT "A MATTER 
OF L AND D," LIFE AND DEATH.

57
00:02:03,456 --> 00:02:05,375
- WHAT IS THE MATTER 
OF LIFE AND DEATH?

58
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:08,294
- BUSTER'S JAW CLICKS 
WHEN HE EATS.

59
00:02:08,294 --> 00:02:10,713
I THINK IT'S WHAT'S 
DRIVING HIS FRIENDS AWAY.

60
00:02:10,713 --> 00:02:13,341
I SENT HIM TO CANADA 
FOR AN OPERATION.

61
00:02:13,341 --> 00:02:16,302
SO I'LL NEED SOME OF THAT 
NEW MONEY THAT JUST CAME IN.

62
00:02:16,302 --> 00:02:17,052
- YOU KNOW, MOM,

63
00:02:17,052 --> 00:02:18,263
IF YOU WANT AN OPERATION 
THAT'S REALLY GONNA HELP HIM,

64
00:02:18,263 --> 00:02:20,723
YOU OUGHT TO HAVE THEM 
FINALLY CUT THAT CORD.

65
00:02:20,723 --> 00:02:21,807
- HE NEEDS ME.

66
00:02:21,807 --> 00:02:23,809
- HE DOESN'T NEED YOU. 
YOU CODDLE HIM.

67
00:02:23,809 --> 00:02:26,103
HE'S TOO OLD 
TO GO RUNNING TO HIS MOMMY

68
00:02:26,103 --> 00:02:26,937
WITH ALL HIS PROBLEMS.

69
00:02:26,937 --> 00:02:30,233
- I SEEM TO REMEMBER 
A CERTAIN SOMEONE

70
00:02:30,233 --> 00:02:31,359
RUNNING TO MOMMY

71
00:02:31,359 --> 00:02:33,944
WHEN HIS ALGEBRA TEACHER 
MADE AN EXAMPLE OF HIM.

72
00:02:33,944 --> 00:02:35,863
narrator: MICHAEL HAD 
BEEN SUSPENDED

73
00:02:35,863 --> 00:02:38,199
WHEN ANOTHER BOY 
CHEATED OFF HIS TEST.

74
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:39,534
- TRACY WON'T MARRY ME.

75
00:02:39,534 --> 00:02:40,743
I WON'T GET A JOB, AND--

76
00:02:40,743 --> 00:02:43,204
- [shushing]

77
00:02:43,204 --> 00:02:45,998
- WHAT IS THIS? 
WHAT'S HAPPENING?

78
00:02:45,998 --> 00:02:48,042
- LET MAMA TAKE CARE OF IT.

79
00:02:48,042 --> 00:02:52,463
I'LL HAVE A LITTLE CHAT 
WITH MR. VANDENBOSCH.

80
00:02:52,463 --> 00:02:56,008
narrator: THE NEXT DAY, MR. 
VANDENBOSCH WAS NOT IN SCHOOL.

81
00:02:56,008 --> 00:02:58,344
HE WAS NEVER HEARD FROM AGAIN.

82
00:02:58,344 --> 00:03:00,805
- I-I KNOW LIFE IS NOT FAIR 
TO WOMEN.

83
00:03:00,805 --> 00:03:03,641
YOUR CHILDREN GROW UP, 
AND THEY DON'T NEED YOU ANYMORE.

84
00:03:03,641 --> 00:03:07,228
- AND I SEEM TO REMEMBER 
A CERTAIN GROWN MAN

85
00:03:07,228 --> 00:03:09,230
WHO COMPLETELY FELL APART 
TWO WEEKS AGO

86
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:11,357
WHEN I TAPED OVER 
THE NOVA SPECIAL

87
00:03:11,357 --> 00:03:13,150
THAT HAD THE GIRL ON IT 
HE LIKED.

88
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:16,111
- THAT WAS BUSTER. 
THAT'S MY POINT.

89
00:03:20,032 --> 00:03:21,367
narrator: GEORGE MICHAEL, 
MEANWHILE,

90
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:23,411
WAS AT 
THE FROZEN BANANA STAND

91
00:03:23,411 --> 00:03:25,371
WHEN HE THOUGHT HE SPOTTED 
A FAMILIAR FACE:

92
00:03:25,371 --> 00:03:28,458
- POP-POP?

93
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:29,375
SORRY, MISS. 
[chuckling]

94
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:30,585
POP-POP!

95
00:03:30,585 --> 00:03:32,211
- YOU THINK YOU SAW POP-POP?

96
00:03:32,211 --> 00:03:33,421
- BUT WITH HAIR!

97
00:03:33,421 --> 00:03:35,215
WHICH IS PROBABLY WHY 
HE ASKED FOR MY HAIR, REMEMBER?

98
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:36,131
- GIVE POP-POP YOUR HAIR!

99
00:03:36,131 --> 00:03:37,425
GIVE ME THE HAIR!

100
00:03:37,425 --> 00:03:38,426
- IT ALL ADDS UP.

101
00:03:38,426 --> 00:03:40,511
HE STOLE SOMEBODY'S 
HAIR, MADE A WIG,

102
00:03:40,511 --> 00:03:42,096
KNOCKED OUT THE GUARD,

103
00:03:42,096 --> 00:03:43,764
TUNNELED HIS WAY THROUGH 
A SEWER LINE,

104
00:03:43,764 --> 00:03:45,182
AND THEN STOPPED 
TO GET A CANDY APPLE

105
00:03:45,182 --> 00:03:46,517
ON HIS WAY TO MEXICO!

106
00:03:46,517 --> 00:03:48,102
- OF COURSE!

107
00:03:48,102 --> 00:03:49,144
YOU'RE MOCKING ME.

108
00:03:49,144 --> 00:03:50,396
- [scoffs] 
OF COURSE.

109
00:03:50,396 --> 00:03:52,064
- LISTEN, I KNOW WHAT 
I SAW, MAEBY.

110
00:03:52,064 --> 00:03:54,149
AND THERE'S 
NO OTHER EXPLANATION.

111
00:03:54,149 --> 00:03:55,776
- SO LISTEN. 
MY TWIN BROTHER'S IN TOWN.

112
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:57,152
I WANT YOU TO TAKE CARE OF HIM.

113
00:03:57,152 --> 00:03:58,446
- YOU STILL SEE UNCLE OSCAR?

114
00:03:58,446 --> 00:03:59,489
- TELL YOU WHAT.

115
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:02,199
GIVE HIM TEN GRAND 
FROM THE, UH, NEW CASH.

116
00:04:02,199 --> 00:04:03,368
JUST SEND HIM ON HIS WAY.

117
00:04:03,368 --> 00:04:05,911
- DAD, THE MONEY IS FOR 
THE BUSINESS, OKAY?

118
00:04:05,911 --> 00:04:07,372
I'M NOT JUST GONNA 
HAND IT ALL OUT.

119
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:08,748
- MICHAEL! 
THIS IS MY BROTHER.

120
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:10,500
DO YOU KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE 
TO HAVE A SIBLING

121
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,502
WHO HAS NO SOURCE 
OF INCOME EXCEPT FOR YOU?

122
00:04:12,502 --> 00:04:13,628
- JUST ONE? NO.

123
00:04:13,628 --> 00:04:15,921
NO IDEA. IT SOUNDS 
WONDERFUL THOUGH.

124
00:04:15,921 --> 00:04:18,341
LOOK, THE BOARD IS WATCHING 
EVERY MOVE I MAKE.

125
00:04:18,341 --> 00:04:19,759
ESPECIALLY THAT GUY JORDAN.

126
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:21,176
HE'S JUST WAITING 
FOR ME TO SCREW UP,

127
00:04:21,176 --> 00:04:22,428
SO HE CAN BLOW 
THE WHISTLE ON ME.

128
00:04:22,428 --> 00:04:24,347
- WHY DON'T YOU JUST 
BUY HIM OUT OF HIS STOCK?

129
00:04:24,347 --> 00:04:25,973
- NO, NO. HE WANTS TWICE 
THE VALUE.

130
00:04:25,973 --> 00:04:27,057
BUT--LISTEN.

131
00:04:27,057 --> 00:04:29,352
STOP TELLIN' ME WHAT TO DO 
WITH THE MONEY, PLEASE?

132
00:04:29,352 --> 00:04:30,770
I'VE GOT A PLAN 
FOR THE BOARD MEETING

133
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:32,855
THAT'S GONNA TAKE THE 
GUN RIGHT OUT OF JORDAN'S HAND.

134
00:04:32,855 --> 00:04:34,649
- LISTEN, 
YOU'VE GOT THE MONEY NOW.

135
00:04:34,649 --> 00:04:35,691
AND YOU KNOW MY PRICE.

136
00:04:35,691 --> 00:04:37,652
- YOU DON'T NEED 
A WHISTLE-BLOWER AROUND HERE.

137
00:04:37,652 --> 00:04:40,195
- INTERESTING CHOICE OF WORDS, 
MR. JORDAN.

138
00:04:40,195 --> 00:04:42,365
HE'S RIGHT. WE DON'T NEED 
A WHISTLE-BLOWER.

139
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:45,493
WE NEED A BUILDING 
FULL OF WHISTLE-BLOWERS.

140
00:04:45,493 --> 00:04:47,870
OKAY? WHISTLES.

141
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:49,455
I WANT THIS PLACE 
TO BE HONEST.

142
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:51,624
THAT'S EXACTLY WHY 
I HAD THESE MADE UP FOR US.

143
00:04:51,624 --> 00:04:53,418
WHEN YOU SEE SOMETHING 
WRONG, I WA--

144
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:54,419
[whistles]

145
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:56,128
THERE YOU GO.

146
00:04:56,128 --> 00:04:57,380
I WANT YOU TO REPORT IT.

147
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:59,382
I WANT YOU TO-- 
[whistles]

148
00:04:59,382 --> 00:05:00,758
EXACTLY. JUST LIKE THAT.

149
00:05:00,758 --> 00:05:02,217
I WANT US TO POLICE OURSELVES 
AS VIGILANT--

150
00:05:02,217 --> 00:05:02,843
[whistling]

151
00:05:02,843 --> 00:05:04,929
LET'S WAIT TILL SOMETHING 
ACTUALLY HAPPENS THOUGH.

152
00:05:04,929 --> 00:05:05,930
OKAY, GOOD FUN. 
[chuckles]

153
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:07,765
ALL RIGHT. 
HEY. ENOUGH!

154
00:05:07,765 --> 00:05:10,560
45, 46, 47--

155
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,937
OKAY, THERE'S STILL THREE 
WHISTLES LEFT OUT THERE.

156
00:05:12,937 --> 00:05:15,398
WHO'S GOT THE WHISTLES? 
[whistles]

157
00:05:15,398 --> 00:05:16,399
- HE KEPT ONE.

158
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:18,484
- THERE'S A GOOD EXAMPLE 
OF WHISTLE-BLOWING, OKAY?

159
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:22,279
BUT YOU'VE KEPT YOURS, 
SO IT'S HURTING YOUR CASE.

160
00:05:22,279 --> 00:05:24,949
- I WAS IN THE BATHROOM 
WHEN YOU ASKED FOR IT BACK.

161
00:05:24,949 --> 00:05:26,200
[whistling] 
- NO, HE WASN'T.

162
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,034
- IN ANY EVENT,

163
00:05:27,034 --> 00:05:29,244
WE ARE GOING TO BE 
RESPONSIBLE WITH THIS MONEY.

164
00:05:29,244 --> 00:05:31,706
- MICHAEL, I HOPE I'M NOT 
INTERRUPTING ANYTHING,

165
00:05:31,706 --> 00:05:34,625
BUT I'D LOVE TO GET A HUNK 
OF THAT NEW COMPANY MONEY.

166
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:37,044
[whistling]

167
00:05:37,044 --> 00:05:41,591
- I JUST NEED TO PROVE TO MY 
WIFE THAT I CAN ACT LIKE A MAN.

168
00:05:41,591 --> 00:05:43,258
AND IT'S NOT ABOUT SEX.

169
00:05:43,258 --> 00:05:46,053
I DON'T JUST LIE THERE, 
IF THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE THINKING.

170
00:05:46,053 --> 00:05:47,805
- THAT'S NOT 
WHAT I WAS THINKING.

171
00:05:47,805 --> 00:05:50,182
- SORRY, I JUST--

172
00:05:50,182 --> 00:05:51,767
A QUICK QUESTION FOR MICHAEL.

173
00:05:51,767 --> 00:05:52,935
- IS THIS ABOUT THE MONEY?

174
00:05:52,935 --> 00:05:53,894
- NO! [chuckles]

175
00:05:53,894 --> 00:05:55,062
- WHAT DO YOU WANT?

176
00:05:55,062 --> 00:05:57,523
- I MEAN, IT'S NOT ABOUT MONEY 
IN THE SENSE THAT I'M SAYING,

177
00:05:57,523 --> 00:05:59,149
"HERE, 
MICHAEL, TAKE SOME MONEY."

178
00:05:59,149 --> 00:06:03,070
IT'S JUST MORE OF A "MAY I HAVE 
SOME?" KIND OF VISIT.

179
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:05,406
- DON'T YOU HAVE A WIFE 
THAT YOU CAN ASK NOW?

180
00:06:05,406 --> 00:06:07,742
- SHE LEFT ME. 
- FOR TOBIAS?

181
00:06:07,742 --> 00:06:09,744
- FOR ME? 
- NO!

182
00:06:09,744 --> 00:06:11,370
SHE DOESN'T EVEN LIKE YOU.

183
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:13,247
- I'M IN LOVE WITH 
YOUR BROTHER-IN-LAW.

184
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:15,332
- YOU'RE IN LOVE 
WITH YOUR OWN BROTHER?

185
00:06:15,332 --> 00:06:16,250
THE ONE IN THE ARMY?

186
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:17,334
- NO. 
YOUR SISTER'S HUSBAND.

187
00:06:17,334 --> 00:06:19,420
- MICHAEL? MICHAEL!

188
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:20,963
- NO, THAT'S 
YOUR SISTER'S BROTHER.

189
00:06:20,963 --> 00:06:21,964
- I'M MY SISTER'S BROTHER.

190
00:06:21,964 --> 00:06:23,799
YOU'RE IN LOVE WITH ME. ME!

191
00:06:23,799 --> 00:06:25,551
- I'M IN LOVE WITH TOBIAS.

192
00:06:25,551 --> 00:06:26,927
- MY BROTHER-IN-LAW?

193
00:06:26,927 --> 00:06:28,596
- I KNOW IT CAN NEVER BE. 
SO I'M LEAVING.

194
00:06:28,596 --> 00:06:30,180
I'M ENLISTING IN THE ARMY.

195
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:31,390
- TO BE WITH YOUR BROTHER.

196
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:32,349
- NO!

197
00:06:32,349 --> 00:06:34,727
- ANYWAY, I CAN'T BE EXPECTED 
TO LIVE ON THE $800-A-MONTH

198
00:06:34,727 --> 00:06:36,562
ARMY-WIFE STIPEND 
THAT I'M GONNA GET.

199
00:06:36,562 --> 00:06:38,939
- THEY JUST DON'T 
SUPPORT THE SPOUSES.

200
00:06:38,939 --> 00:06:41,817
- YOU DON'T WANT TO END UP 
LIKE UNCLE OSCAR, OKAY,

201
00:06:41,817 --> 00:06:43,528
LIVING OFF HANDOUTS 
YOUR WHOLE LIFE?

202
00:06:43,528 --> 00:06:45,446
WHY DON'T YOU COME UP 
WITH A WAY TO MAKE MONEY?

203
00:06:45,446 --> 00:06:47,573
A SUGGESTION OF SOMETHING 
TO INVEST IN

204
00:06:47,573 --> 00:06:48,949
OR MAYBE, 
UH, MAYBE A BUSINESS IDEA?

205
00:06:48,949 --> 00:06:51,911
- WELL, I'VE ALWAYS WANTED 
TO REMAKE "ANNIE HALL."

206
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:55,289
EXCEPT I WOULDN'T WANT TO GET 
IN BED WITH A GREEN PRODUCER

207
00:06:55,289 --> 00:06:56,749
LIKE A SOFIA COPPOLA THOUGH.

208
00:06:56,749 --> 00:06:59,460
OH, BUT GIVE ME AN OLD PRO, 
LIKE A ROBERT REDFORD?

209
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:02,171
OH, I'D JUMP INTO BED 
WITH HIM IN A SECOND.

210
00:07:02,171 --> 00:07:05,716
AND I WOULDN'T JUST 
LIE THERE, MICHAEL BLUTH,

211
00:07:05,716 --> 00:07:07,342
IF THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE THINKING.

212
00:07:07,342 --> 00:07:09,053
- ACTUALLY, THAT TIME THAT WAS 
WHAT I WAS THINKING.

213
00:07:09,053 --> 00:07:10,054
- [chuckles]

214
00:07:10,054 --> 00:07:11,597
narrator: AND LATER THAT DAY,

215
00:07:11,597 --> 00:07:13,724
MAEBY SPOTTED 
SOMETHING INTERESTING.

216
00:07:18,353 --> 00:07:20,230
LINDSAY, MEANWHILE, 
ARRIVED AT THE SALON

217
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:23,150
HOPING TO INCREASE 
HER SELF-ESTEEM.

218
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:25,486
UNFORTUNATELY, HER STYLIST 
HAD JUST BEEN CALLED UP

219
00:07:25,486 --> 00:07:26,737
BY HIS RESERVE UNIT.

220
00:07:26,737 --> 00:07:28,363
- WHAT'S HAPPENING? 
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

221
00:07:28,363 --> 00:07:29,490
- I'M NOT ALLOWED TO TELL.

222
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:30,658
IT'S THE WAR.

223
00:07:30,658 --> 00:07:34,036
- OH, COME ON! THESE SALON 
WARS HAVE GOT TO STOP!

224
00:07:34,036 --> 00:07:36,789
- THE WAR, LINDSAY. 
THE REAL WAR.

225
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:38,165
narrator: LINDSAY WAS STUNNED,

226
00:07:38,165 --> 00:07:40,084
NOT JUST THAT SHE WAS LOSING 
HER STYLIST,

227
00:07:40,084 --> 00:07:42,837
BUT THAT APPARENTLY, 
THERE WAS A WAR GOING ON.

228
00:07:42,837 --> 00:07:45,673
- WELL, I'M PROTESTING THIS WAR. 
YOU'RE MY FRIEND,

229
00:07:45,673 --> 00:07:48,008
AND I'M NOT GONNA LET 
SHAUNA CUT MY HAIR.

230
00:07:48,008 --> 00:07:50,177
I'M GOING TO TAKE A STAND.

231
00:07:50,177 --> 00:07:52,012
narrator: 
AND LINDSAY FOUND A SOLUTION

232
00:07:52,012 --> 00:07:53,347
TO HER SELF-ESTEEM PROBLEM.

233
00:07:53,347 --> 00:07:54,682
GOB AND TOBIAS, MEANWHILE,

234
00:07:54,682 --> 00:07:57,392
WERE BRAINSTORMING 
AT A LOCAL COFFEE SHOP.

235
00:07:57,392 --> 00:07:59,103
- I NEED A CUP OF COFFEE 
TO FOCUS.

236
00:07:59,103 --> 00:08:02,106
- IT'S SO CROWDED IN HERE. 
I CAN'T THINK.

237
00:08:02,106 --> 00:08:04,399
OKAY. 
WHAT IS IT THAT PEOPLE NEED?

238
00:08:04,399 --> 00:08:06,819
- PEOPLE LOVE TO CARBO-LOAD.

239
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:09,238
THE BAGEL PLACE. 
- THERE YOU GO.

240
00:08:09,238 --> 00:08:10,781
- HEY, GUYS. WHAT'S GOIN' ON?

241
00:08:10,781 --> 00:08:12,658
- JUST RESEARCHING 
OUR INVESTMENT.

242
00:08:12,658 --> 00:08:16,036
- OH, YEAH. COFFEE PLACES. 
I'VE THOUGHT ABOUT THESE.

243
00:08:16,036 --> 00:08:17,412
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT.

244
00:08:17,412 --> 00:08:19,874
YOU GUYS COME UP WITH A 
PROPOSAL, WE'LL TRY ONE.

245
00:08:19,874 --> 00:08:21,208
narrator: 
GOB AND TOBIAS

246
00:08:21,208 --> 00:08:22,793
ACCIDENTALLY 
HAD MICHAEL ON THE HOOK,

247
00:08:22,793 --> 00:08:24,837
AND THEY DIDN'T WANT 
TO BLOW THE DEAL.

248
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,722
- I GUESS THAT'S A RESPONSE.

249
00:08:34,722 --> 00:08:35,640
- HEY, NEPHEW.

250
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,558
- OH, HEY! 
[chuckles]

251
00:08:37,558 --> 00:08:39,602
UNCLE OSCAR. 
HOW ARE YOU DOIN'?

252
00:08:39,602 --> 00:08:41,145
- WOW, YOU ARE LIKE, 
LIKE A ROCK.

253
00:08:41,145 --> 00:08:42,312
- [chuckling, groaning]

254
00:08:42,312 --> 00:08:43,438
- OH, THE TENSION! COME ON.

255
00:08:43,438 --> 00:08:44,815
- OH, OKAY. 
THAT'S PLENTY.

256
00:08:44,815 --> 00:08:46,901
- OKAY, RIGHT THERE. THAT'S 
THE PANCREAS RIGHT THERE.

257
00:08:46,901 --> 00:08:48,528
- WHAT'S HAPPENING NOW? 
[chuckles uneasily]

258
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:49,779
narrator: 
THE TWO MEN RECONNECTED,

259
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:51,697
NEITHER ONE ANXIOUS TO 
BRING UP THE ISSUE AT HAND.

260
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:52,740
- ONE ON THE LIPS.

261
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:54,366
- OBVIOUSLY, 
DAD'S IN PRISON NOW.

262
00:08:54,366 --> 00:08:56,410
I'M RUNNING THE BUSINESS 
A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENTLY.

263
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:58,120
- WELL, YOU DO THE BEST 
WITH WHAT YOU HAVE.

264
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:58,746
- YEAH.

265
00:08:58,746 --> 00:09:00,039
- I HAVE LEMONS, 
I MAKE LEMONADE.

266
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:02,499
- THAT'S A VERY 
POSITIVE ATTITUDE.

267
00:09:02,499 --> 00:09:03,876
- BUT I HATE 
THE LEMONADE BUSINESS.

268
00:09:03,876 --> 00:09:06,128
I HATE THE GRIND. YOU HAVE TO 
GRIND SO MANY [bleep] LEMONS.

269
00:09:06,128 --> 00:09:08,380
- YOU'RE NOT A VERY 
METAPHORICAL PERSON, ARE YOU?

270
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:09,298
- I NEED MONEY.

271
00:09:09,298 --> 00:09:11,258
- I KNOW.

272
00:09:11,258 --> 00:09:14,595
- [sighs] AH, I CANNOT TELL YOU 
HOW THAT HAS WEIGHED ON ME.

273
00:09:14,595 --> 00:09:16,430
[passing gas] 
MM.

274
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:19,892
- WHY DON'T WE SIT OVER HERE?

275
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:25,230
SO I'VE GOT TOO MANY PEOPLE 
WATCHING ME TOO CLOSELY.

276
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:27,066
SO IF YOU'RE WILLING 
TO WORK,

277
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:29,359
OR IF YOU HAVE 
SOMETHING OF VALUE--

278
00:09:29,359 --> 00:09:32,029
- THE ONLY THING I HAVE 
OF VALUE IS MY LAND.

279
00:09:32,029 --> 00:09:34,740
I COULD GIVE YOU THE RIGHTS 
TO "ALL YOU NEED ARE SMILES."

280
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:36,366
THAT WAS A SONG I WROTE 
FOR DAVID CASSIDY;

281
00:09:36,366 --> 00:09:38,243
HE WAS GONNA SING 
IT ON THE MIKE DOUGLAS SHOW.

282
00:09:38,243 --> 00:09:39,787
BUT HE WAS TOO EMBARRASSED 
TO DO IT

283
00:09:39,787 --> 00:09:40,788
IN FRONT 
OF JOHN AND YOKO.

284
00:09:40,788 --> 00:09:42,414
- TELL ME ABOUT THE LAND.

285
00:09:42,414 --> 00:09:45,292
- OH, LAND. IT'S A COUPLE 
HUNDRED ACRES OF LEMON GROVES,

286
00:09:45,292 --> 00:09:46,711
RIGHT NEAR CAMP PENDLETON.

287
00:09:46,711 --> 00:09:49,254
- IF YOU'RE WILLING TO PART 
WITH THAT LAND, UNCLE OSCAR,

288
00:09:49,254 --> 00:09:52,717
I CAN GUARANTEE YOU A LITTLE BIT 
MORE THAN THAT $10,000.

289
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:55,595
- TO BE HONEST, I'VE OFTEN 
THOUGHT OF GIVING IT UP

290
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:57,888
TO PURSUE MY--MY LOST LOVE.

291
00:09:57,888 --> 00:10:00,224
THE LOVE THAT WAS TAKEN FROM ME.

292
00:10:00,224 --> 00:10:01,266
[passing gas]

293
00:10:01,266 --> 00:10:03,728
- I HOPE THAT WAS 
THE ESPRESSO MACHINE.

294
00:10:03,728 --> 00:10:06,396
narrator: MICHAEL MADE THE TRIP 
TO SURVEY THE LAND.

295
00:10:06,396 --> 00:10:09,358
IT WAS, INDEED, BEAUTIFUL.

296
00:10:09,358 --> 00:10:12,653
AND THE NEXT DAY, HE WENT 
TO HIS FATHER TO TELL HIM.

297
00:10:12,653 --> 00:10:13,988
- YOU GIVE THAT GIFT 
TO MY BROTHER?

298
00:10:13,988 --> 00:10:14,614
- GIFT? NO.

299
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:15,698
I DID NOT GIVE HIM A GIFT.

300
00:10:15,698 --> 00:10:17,532
I TOLD YOU. THE MONEY 
WAS FOR INVESTING,

301
00:10:17,532 --> 00:10:19,451
AND THAT'S EXACTLY 
WHAT I DID WITH IT, POP.

302
00:10:19,451 --> 00:10:20,244
- OH, MICHAEL!

303
00:10:20,244 --> 00:10:22,162
THIS GUY HAS GOT 
NOTHING IN HIS LIFE.

304
00:10:22,162 --> 00:10:24,081
HE WROTE ONE SONG THAT 
MADE JOAN BAEZ CALL HIM

305
00:10:24,081 --> 00:10:25,958
"THE SHALLOWEST MAN 
IN THE WORLD."

306
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:28,085
HE HAS A WORTHLESS PIECE 
OF PROPERTY

307
00:10:28,085 --> 00:10:29,712
AND, YES, 
A HEAD OF HAIR--

308
00:10:29,712 --> 00:10:31,922
ONLY BECAUSE HE'S NEVER 
HAD TO WORK FOR A LIVING.

309
00:10:31,922 --> 00:10:34,008
- WAIT, NOW. WHAT PIECE 
OF PROPERTY'S WORTHLESS?

310
00:10:34,008 --> 00:10:35,592
- THE GROVE. 
YOU KNOW, WHERE HE LIVES.

311
00:10:35,592 --> 00:10:37,302
I MEAN, 
YOU CAN'T BUILD ON IT.

312
00:10:37,302 --> 00:10:38,929
THE GOVERNMENT 
HAS AN EASEMENT ON IT.

313
00:10:38,929 --> 00:10:40,264
- DOES OSCAR KNOW THIS?

314
00:10:40,264 --> 00:10:41,598
- OF COURSE HE KNOWS IT.

315
00:10:41,598 --> 00:10:44,309
I MEAN, THEY RUN THEIR-- 
THEIR TANKS THROUGH THERE.

316
00:10:44,309 --> 00:10:46,311
OCCASIONALLY, THEY STOP 
FOR A LITTLE LEMONADE,

317
00:10:46,311 --> 00:10:47,855
BUT WHAT'S THAT? 
THAT'S A BUCK FIFTY.

318
00:10:47,855 --> 00:10:49,273
YOU CAN'T MAKE MUCH 
FROM THAT.

319
00:10:49,273 --> 00:10:51,066
narrator: INDEED, THE LAND 
WAS VALUELESS.

320
00:10:51,066 --> 00:10:53,443
[explosion]

321
00:10:53,443 --> 00:10:54,278
[tank rumbling]

322
00:10:54,278 --> 00:10:56,756
- FELLAS! FELLAS!

323
00:10:56,756 --> 00:11:00,993
- SO TELL ME ABOUT 
THIS INVESTMENT YOU MADE.

324
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:08,793
narrator: BACK AT THE MODEL 
HOME, LINDSAY HAD DECIDED

325
00:11:08,793 --> 00:11:11,671
NOT TO TAKE HER STYLIST'S 
DEPARTURE LYING DOWN.

326
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:13,005
- I'M PROTESTING THE WAR.

327
00:11:13,005 --> 00:11:15,299
THERE'S A WAR GOING ON, 
YOU KNOW?

328
00:11:15,299 --> 00:11:16,591
- YEAH, I'M THE ONE WHO 
TOLD YOU,

329
00:11:16,591 --> 00:11:18,135
AND YOU SAID 
IT HAPPENED TEN YEARS AGO.

330
00:11:18,135 --> 00:11:19,762
- HEY, ISN'T THIS THE SAME 
SIGN YOU USED

331
00:11:19,762 --> 00:11:20,888
TO PICKET 
THE CABLE COMPANY

332
00:11:20,888 --> 00:11:22,347
WHEN THEY DROPPED 
THE STYLE NETWORK?

333
00:11:22,347 --> 00:11:23,891
- ACTUALLY, I USED THIS ONE 
FOR MICHAEL

334
00:11:23,891 --> 00:11:26,018
WHEN HE WAS TOO CHEAP TO PAY 
FOR THE PREMIUM CHANNELS.

335
00:11:26,018 --> 00:11:29,271
BUT I ADDED THE BIT 
ABOUT THE STYLISTS.

336
00:11:30,439 --> 00:11:31,648
- YOU KNOW THAT SECRET YOU HAVE?

337
00:11:31,648 --> 00:11:34,819
THE ONE ABOUT THE HAIR THAT 
NOBODY'S SUPPOSED TO SEE?

338
00:11:34,819 --> 00:11:35,861
- HAI--

339
00:11:35,861 --> 00:11:38,572
- I SAW IT.

340
00:11:38,572 --> 00:11:41,491
- OH. 
- I SAW POP-POP.

341
00:11:41,491 --> 00:11:43,702
- OH, RIGHT. 
POP-POP WITH HAIR.

342
00:11:43,702 --> 00:11:45,204
YOU KNOW, I SHOULD TELL 
MY DAD ABOUT--

343
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:46,371
- NO, YOU [bleep].

344
00:11:46,371 --> 00:11:47,832
HE MIGHT NEED US TO 
HELP HIM,

345
00:11:47,832 --> 00:11:49,208
SO WE SHOULD GO 
CHECK OUT THE PRISON

346
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:50,459
AND MAKE SURE HE'S NOT THERE.

347
00:11:50,459 --> 00:11:51,501
[door opening]

348
00:11:51,501 --> 00:11:52,544
- OH.

349
00:11:52,544 --> 00:11:55,756
- HEY, YOU KNOW, I GOT CABLE. 
YOU WON THAT ONE!

350
00:11:55,756 --> 00:11:56,799
[beeping]

351
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:59,218
- MICHAEL WAS EMBARRASSED ABOUT 
THE BAD INVESTMENT HE'D MADE

352
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:01,178
AND WAS HOPING 
TO KEEP IT A SECRET.

353
00:12:01,178 --> 00:12:04,014
- HI, THIS IS OSCAR. I'M OFF, 
PURSUING MY LADY LOVE.

354
00:12:04,014 --> 00:12:06,809
LEAVE A MESSAGE. I'LL GET 
BACK TO YOU NEXT SUMMER.

355
00:12:06,809 --> 00:12:08,102
[beeping] 
- HEY, IT'S MICHAEL.

356
00:12:08,102 --> 00:12:09,937
I KNOW THAT YOU THINK THAT 
YOU'VE DISAPPEARED,

357
00:12:09,937 --> 00:12:11,105
BUT I WILL FIND YOU.

358
00:12:11,105 --> 00:12:12,356
[beeps]

359
00:12:12,356 --> 00:12:14,191
- WHO'S DISAPPEARED? 
- NO ONE.

360
00:12:14,191 --> 00:12:15,901
- WHY DO YOU ASK? 
HAVE YOU SEEN SOMEONE?

361
00:12:15,901 --> 00:12:16,902
- I'VE SEEN NO ONE.

362
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:19,529
- THEN YOU HAVEN'T SEEN ANYONE 
THAT LOOKS LIKE POP-POP.

363
00:12:19,529 --> 00:12:20,530
- NO. WHY?

364
00:12:20,530 --> 00:12:22,699
HAS SOMEONE WHO LOOKS 
LIKE POP-POP DISAPPEARED?

365
00:12:22,699 --> 00:12:23,742
- NO. COURSE NOT.

366
00:12:26,912 --> 00:12:29,706
- HAVE YOU SEEN 
THE AGRICULTURAL REPORT?

367
00:12:29,706 --> 00:12:33,460
- NOTHING'S HOTTER THAN COFFEE, 
SO THE TREND IS UP.

368
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:35,462
SO IF WE COULD GET 
THAT CHECK FROM YOU--

369
00:12:35,462 --> 00:12:38,298
- I'M NOT JUST GONNA 
HAND OUT A CHECK, OKAY?

370
00:12:38,298 --> 00:12:40,259
YOU GOTTA COME UP 
WITH AN INVESTMENT PLAN,

371
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:41,385
YOU GOTTA CALL--

372
00:12:41,385 --> 00:12:43,971
- OH, WE'VE GOT 
AN INVESTMENT PLAN.

373
00:12:43,971 --> 00:12:45,680
- "GOBIAS INDUSTRIES."

374
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,307
- GO BIAS. 
- HMM?

375
00:12:47,307 --> 00:12:49,684
- AS IN, "GO BUY US 
SOME COFFEE."

376
00:12:49,684 --> 00:12:51,937
- IT'S GREAT. LOOKS GOOD.

377
00:12:51,937 --> 00:12:54,940
- SO WHEN DO I START 
MAKIN' MY MONEYS?

378
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:57,651
- WELL, UM, THERE, UH-- 
THERE MAY NOT BE

379
00:12:57,651 --> 00:13:00,821
AS MUCH INVESTMENT CAPITAL 
AS WE THOUGHT.

380
00:13:00,821 --> 00:13:04,158
UH, MONEY'S KIND OF 
TIED UP IN THIS LAND DEAL.

381
00:13:04,158 --> 00:13:07,036
- THIS IS THE FIRST ANY 
OF US AT GOBIAS INDUSTRIES

382
00:13:07,036 --> 00:13:08,578
HAVE HEARD OF A LAND DEAL.

383
00:13:08,578 --> 00:13:10,455
- WE COULD BORROW ON THAT LAND.

384
00:13:10,455 --> 00:13:11,957
- THERE'S NOT MUCH 
TO BORROW AGAINST.

385
00:13:11,957 --> 00:13:14,001
THE DEAL SEEMS TO BE BAD.

386
00:13:14,001 --> 00:13:17,337
IT'S UNCLE OSCAR'S LAND, 
AND IT MAY BE WORTHLESS.

387
00:13:17,337 --> 00:13:18,839
- AND THE BOARD OKAYED IT?

388
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:20,049
- WELL, THEY WEREN'T NOTIFIED.

389
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:23,552
- DAMN IT! EVERY TIME, 
DAD DOES THIS TO US.

390
00:13:23,552 --> 00:13:24,887
- GOB, DAD REALLY WASN'T--

391
00:13:24,887 --> 00:13:26,180
- OH, PLEASE! 
HE WENT AROUND YOU.

392
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:28,223
HE WENT AROUND THE BOARD-- 
- HE STEAMROLLED GOBIAS.

393
00:13:28,223 --> 00:13:29,391
- YEAH, WHAT 
ARE YOU GONNA DO?

394
00:13:29,391 --> 00:13:30,767
- I'M GOING TO GO DOWN 
TO THAT PRISON

395
00:13:30,767 --> 00:13:32,019
AND GIVE HIM A PIECE 
OF MY MIND.

396
00:13:32,019 --> 00:13:33,645
- HEY, GOB, NO, YOU DON'T NEED 
TO DO THAT.

397
00:13:33,645 --> 00:13:34,980
- NO, I'M DOING IT! 
- NO, YOU DON'T.

398
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:36,356
- NO, BECAUSE 
YOU'RE IN CHARGE NOW.

399
00:13:36,356 --> 00:13:37,399
AND I'M TELLING HIM THAT.

400
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:39,026
- NO, NO, NO, NO. 
LISTEN, GOB, HE'S HUMAN.

401
00:13:39,026 --> 00:13:40,444
HE'S A HUMAN BEING,

402
00:13:40,444 --> 00:13:43,738
AND LET-LET ME TRY TO GET US 
OUT OF THIS, YOU KNOW?

403
00:13:43,738 --> 00:13:45,991
LET ME JUST SEE IF I CAN GET 
DAD OUT OF THIS MESS

404
00:13:45,991 --> 00:13:47,534
THAT HE HAS 
CREATED FOR HIMSELF, OKAY?

405
00:13:47,534 --> 00:13:51,621
- I'M AFRAID THIS OFFER 
COMES OFF THE TABLE

406
00:13:51,621 --> 00:13:54,249
AT MIDNIGHT TONIGHT.

407
00:13:54,249 --> 00:13:57,002
- MAYBE THE WORST BLUFF 
I'VE EVER SEEN.

408
00:13:57,002 --> 00:14:00,881
narrator: EVEN THE MEMBERS 
OF GOBIAS AGREED ON THAT ONE.

409
00:14:00,881 --> 00:14:02,216
THE NEXT DAY, LINDSAY,

410
00:14:02,216 --> 00:14:05,552
HAVING HEARD 
ABOUT A MILITARY EXERCISE,

411
00:14:05,552 --> 00:14:06,929
JOINED A PROTEST GROUP

412
00:14:06,929 --> 00:14:09,639
AND WENT OFF TO EXERCISE HER 
OWN FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHTS.

413
00:14:09,639 --> 00:14:12,101
- THIS WAY! 
THANK YOU!

414
00:14:12,101 --> 00:14:14,144
RIGHT HERE. THIS WAY.

415
00:14:14,144 --> 00:14:15,479
I ASK YOU TO MAKE SURE

416
00:14:15,479 --> 00:14:17,481
YOU'RE FULLY INSIDE 
THE FREE SPEECH ZONE

417
00:14:17,481 --> 00:14:18,941
BEFORE BEGINNING 
YOUR PROTEST.

418
00:14:18,941 --> 00:14:19,733
- FREE SPEECH ZONE?

419
00:14:19,733 --> 00:14:21,235
THIS IS WHERE WE'RE 
PROTESTING?

420
00:14:21,235 --> 00:14:22,862
THIS ISN'T RIGHT. 
WHERE ARE THE CAMERAS?

421
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:24,196
- THEY'RE IN 
THE FREE PRESS ZONE,

422
00:14:24,196 --> 00:14:26,031
AND IF YOU COULD 
SAVE YOUR COMMENTS UNTIL

423
00:14:26,031 --> 00:14:27,741
YOU'RE COMPLETELY LOADED 
INTO THE CAGE.

424
00:14:27,741 --> 00:14:29,910
- WELL, AT LEAST THE PROCESSION 
WILL COME THROUGH HERE.

425
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:30,827
THEY'LL SEE US PROTEST.

426
00:14:30,827 --> 00:14:32,412
- ACTUALLY, THEY'RE USING 
THEIR RIGHT

427
00:14:32,412 --> 00:14:33,914
TO CUT THROUGH 
THE LEMON GROVE.

428
00:14:33,914 --> 00:14:36,333
- OKAY, HAVE FUN, ENJOY 
YOUR RIGHT TO FREE SPEECH.

429
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:38,168
THE ARMED FORCES 
WELCOMES YOUR DISSENT.

430
00:14:38,168 --> 00:14:40,420
- WELL, HOPEFULLY SOMEBODY WILL 
COME BY WE CAN PROTEST.

431
00:14:47,094 --> 00:14:49,429
- MY GRANDKIDS. 
WHAT A SURPRISE.

432
00:14:49,429 --> 00:14:50,555
- OH, HE'S HERE.

433
00:14:50,555 --> 00:14:52,724
- OF COURSE I'M HERE. 
WHERE ELSE WOULD I BE?

434
00:14:52,724 --> 00:14:54,518
- WELL, WE THOUGHT YOU BROKE 
OUT OF PRISON

435
00:14:54,518 --> 00:14:56,020
AND WERE ON THE LAM 
WITH STOLEN HAIR.

436
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:58,063
- DON'T YOU THINK THAT 
IF I GOT OUT OF HERE,

437
00:14:58,063 --> 00:14:59,148
I MIGHT WANT TO GO HOME?

438
00:14:59,148 --> 00:15:00,524
- THAT'S WHAT WE THOUGHT.

439
00:15:00,524 --> 00:15:02,734
BUT THEN MY DAD TOLD US ABOUT 
THAT LEMON GROVE YOU BOUGHT,

440
00:15:02,734 --> 00:15:04,153
AND WE THOUGHT 
YOU WERE GOING THERE.

441
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:05,154
- YEAH, BUT DON'T WORRY.

442
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:07,531
WE WOULD NEVER 
BLOW THE WHISTLE ON FAMILY.

443
00:15:07,531 --> 00:15:08,949
- WHAT LEMON GROVE?

444
00:15:10,492 --> 00:15:12,577
narrator: AND SO MICHAEL WENT 
BACK TO THE BOARD

445
00:15:12,577 --> 00:15:15,039
TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY 
FOR HIS MISTAKE.

446
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:16,373
- MY DAD SCREWED UP.

447
00:15:16,373 --> 00:15:18,417
HE BOUGHT SOMETHING 
THAT HE SHOULDN'T HAVE.

448
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:20,835
BUT I GUESS--GUESS 
THAT'S WHY HE'S BEHIND BARS.

449
00:15:20,835 --> 00:15:21,878
- YEAH.

450
00:15:21,878 --> 00:15:24,464
AND HE'S NOT ALLOWED TO 
CONDUCT ANY BUSINESS FROM THERE.

451
00:15:24,464 --> 00:15:25,590
- [inhales] RIGHT, YEAH.

452
00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:28,427
I WAS INVOLVED. 
IT WASN'T ALL HIS DECISION.

453
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:29,428
YOU SEE, IT WAS HIS IDEA,

454
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:31,471
AND THEN I CARRIED OUT 
THE TRANSACTION.

455
00:15:31,471 --> 00:15:32,556
- THAT'S EVEN WORSE.

456
00:15:32,556 --> 00:15:35,059
CONSPIRACY TO COMMIT FRAUD.

457
00:15:35,059 --> 00:15:37,477
'COURSE, YOU CAN ALWAYS 
BUY ME OFF THE BOARD.

458
00:15:37,477 --> 00:15:39,646
- WE DON'T HAVE 
THE MONEY ANYMORE.

459
00:15:39,646 --> 00:15:42,316
AND I ASSURE YOU THAT NOTHING 
ILLEGAL HAS HAPPENED HERE.

460
00:15:42,316 --> 00:15:43,692
I'VE MISSPOKE.

461
00:15:43,692 --> 00:15:46,987
MY DAD IN NO WAY IS TALKING 
ABOUT BUSINESS FROM PRISON.

462
00:15:46,987 --> 00:15:47,821
[knocking]

463
00:15:47,821 --> 00:15:48,905
- [softly] EXCUSE ME.

464
00:15:48,905 --> 00:15:50,324
YOUR FATHER'S 
CALLING FROM PRISON.

465
00:15:50,324 --> 00:15:51,783
HE WANTS TO TALK TO YOU

466
00:15:51,783 --> 00:15:53,785
ABOUT THE LAND DEAL YOU MADE 
WITH HIS BROTHER.

467
00:15:53,785 --> 00:15:55,037
HEY, I FOUND THIS 
ON YOUR DESK.

468
00:15:55,037 --> 00:15:56,455
CAN I KEEP THIS? 
[whistles]

469
00:16:01,668 --> 00:16:03,795
narrator: BACK 
AT THE FREE SPEECH ZONE,

470
00:16:03,795 --> 00:16:06,506
LINDSAY'S PROTEST HAD STARTED 
TO GAIN SOME ATTENTION.

471
00:16:06,506 --> 00:16:08,467
BUT NOT FROM ANY 
KEY DECISION MAKERS.

472
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:10,594
- THOUGHT WE WERE SEEIN' 
A GAY MARRIAGE.

473
00:16:10,594 --> 00:16:12,096
- WELL, WE CAN STILL 
HOSE 'EM DOWN.

474
00:16:12,096 --> 00:16:14,223
- WHAT DO WE WANT? 
[indistinct chanting]

475
00:16:14,223 --> 00:16:16,516
WHAT DO WE WANT? 
[chanting continues]

476
00:16:16,516 --> 00:16:18,518
[yelling, indistinct]

477
00:16:18,518 --> 00:16:20,562
- WHERE'S EVERYONE GOING?

478
00:16:20,562 --> 00:16:22,147
WHAT, ARE YOU GIVING UP?

479
00:16:22,147 --> 00:16:24,149
- FACE IT, LINDSAY. 
THEY'VE WON.

480
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:25,775
- WELL, I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE!

481
00:16:25,775 --> 00:16:27,069
ALL YOUR WATER'S DOING

482
00:16:27,069 --> 00:16:28,862
IS WHETTING MY APPETITE 
FOR PROTEST.

483
00:16:28,862 --> 00:16:32,366
NO HAIR FOR OIL! 
NO HAIR FOR OIL!

484
00:16:32,366 --> 00:16:34,493
- FINE! WE'LL DROWN 
YOU OUT WITH MUSIC.

485
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:36,620
- CRANK IT UP! 
I'M IN THE MOOD TO DANCE!

486
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:38,330
[disco]

487
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:39,331
[volume increases]

488
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:41,625
- [singing] BAD GIRLS

489
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:44,294
TALKIN' 'BOUT THE SAD GIRL.

490
00:16:44,294 --> 00:16:45,629
narrator: AND LINDSAY DISCOVERED

491
00:16:45,629 --> 00:16:47,464
THAT THE ACTIVISM THAT CAME OUT 
OF HER DESIRE

492
00:16:47,464 --> 00:16:50,675
FOR PRETTIER HAIR REALLY 
DID BOOST HER SELF-ESTEEM.

493
00:16:50,675 --> 00:16:52,927
WHILE MICHAEL, 
WITH NOWHERE ELSE TO TURN,

494
00:16:52,927 --> 00:16:55,472
MADE A RARE, UNSOLICITED VISIT 
TO HIS MOTHER'S.

495
00:16:55,472 --> 00:16:57,432
- MICHAEL? 
- YEAH.

496
00:16:57,432 --> 00:17:00,644
- I HOPE YOU'RE HERE TO BRING ME 
A CHECK FOR BUSTER'S SURGERY.

497
00:17:00,644 --> 00:17:03,022
THEY MADE HIM STOP EATING 
AFTER MIDNIGHT, AND HE'S HUNGRY,

498
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:04,064
AND HE'S IN A FOREIGN LAND,

499
00:17:04,064 --> 00:17:06,483
AND HIS JAW IS CLICKING, 
AND HE'S SCARED.

500
00:17:06,483 --> 00:17:08,485
- I DON'T HAVE THE MONEY. 
ALL RIGHT, MOM?

501
00:17:08,485 --> 00:17:09,819
- THEN WHY ARE YOU HERE?

502
00:17:09,819 --> 00:17:12,239
- I DON'T KNOW. 
I DON'T KNOW.

503
00:17:16,701 --> 00:17:19,621
- SO HOW'S WORK?

504
00:17:19,621 --> 00:17:22,499
- IT'S-IT'S NOT GREAT, 
MOM, SINCE YOU ASKED.

505
00:17:22,499 --> 00:17:24,709
IT'S-IT'S JUST--IT'S NOT THAT 
GREAT, YOU KNOW?

506
00:17:24,709 --> 00:17:26,878
I GOT A BOARD MEMBER 
WHO'S TRYING TO EXTORT ME,

507
00:17:26,878 --> 00:17:28,547
AND A SELLER I CAN'T FIND--

508
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:30,382
THIS WHOLE REAL ESTATE THING 
IS A TOTAL MESS--

509
00:17:30,382 --> 00:17:31,716
I GOT DAD COMPLETELY--

510
00:17:31,716 --> 00:17:32,759
- WHAT DID YOUR FATHER DO?

511
00:17:32,759 --> 00:17:34,553
DID HE TRY TO SCREW 
SOMETHING UP FOR YOU AGAIN?

512
00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:36,012
- NO, NO. 
HE DIDN'T SCREW ANYTHING UP.

513
00:17:36,012 --> 00:17:37,222
I SCREWED SOMETHING UP, MOM.

514
00:17:37,222 --> 00:17:40,767
I-I DID IT, AND DAD IS JUST, 
YOU KNOW, FURIOUS AT ME.

515
00:17:40,767 --> 00:17:42,311
AND HE SHOULD BE, YOU KNOW?

516
00:17:42,311 --> 00:17:44,229
HE TOLD ME TO PAY OFF 
HIS BROTHER, AND I DIDN'T.

517
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:46,148
INSTEAD, I BOUGHT 
HIS WORTHLESS LAND.

518
00:17:46,148 --> 00:17:47,524
- WITH THE LEMONS 
AND THE TANKS?

519
00:17:47,524 --> 00:17:48,775
- I KNOW IT!

520
00:17:48,775 --> 00:17:50,902
FIRST INVESTMENT I MADE 
WITH THE COMPANY MONEY,

521
00:17:50,902 --> 00:17:52,028
AND IT'S A TOTAL DISASTER.

522
00:17:52,028 --> 00:17:53,572
THEN I WENT AHEAD AND LIED 
ABOUT IT,

523
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:55,115
WHICH IS GONNA 
LET THIS BOARD MEMBER

524
00:17:55,115 --> 00:17:56,450
BRING THE COMPANY DOWN.

525
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:57,867
I'M GONNA RUIN THIS FAMILY, 
MOM.

526
00:17:57,867 --> 00:18:00,329
- [shushing]

527
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:02,497
- WHAT'S THIS? 
WHAT'S HAPPENING?

528
00:18:02,497 --> 00:18:04,166
- IT'S GOING TO BE ALL RIGHT.

529
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:05,834
- WHY ARE YOU SQUEEZING ME 
WITH YOUR BODY?

530
00:18:05,834 --> 00:18:07,877
- IT'S A HUG, MICHAEL. 
I'M HUGGING YOU.

531
00:18:07,877 --> 00:18:08,878
- WHY?

532
00:18:08,878 --> 00:18:10,672
- BECAUSE YOU NEED 
YOUR MOTHER RIGHT NOW.

533
00:18:10,672 --> 00:18:13,007
- BUT I DON'T GET ALONG 
WITH MY--SORRY.

534
00:18:13,007 --> 00:18:14,134
THAT WAS A KNEE JERK.

535
00:18:14,134 --> 00:18:15,677
- MICHAEL. 
YOU MADE A MISTAKE.

536
00:18:15,677 --> 00:18:18,138
YOU'RE A HUMAN BEING.

537
00:18:18,138 --> 00:18:21,600
BUT YOU'RE SO FORGIVING 
TO EVERYONE ELSE IN THIS FAMILY.

538
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,643
TRY BEING FORGIVING 
TO YOURSELF.

539
00:18:23,643 --> 00:18:27,981
NOW, IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME.

540
00:18:27,981 --> 00:18:29,566
LET MAMA TAKE CARE OF IT.

541
00:18:29,566 --> 00:18:30,775
- NO, NO.

542
00:18:30,775 --> 00:18:32,527
MOM, COME ON. I DON'T 
WANT YOU TO DO ANYTHING.

543
00:18:32,527 --> 00:18:33,695
HEY! THIS ISN'T ALGEBRA.

544
00:18:33,695 --> 00:18:34,863
I'M A BIG BOY. MOTHER!

545
00:18:34,863 --> 00:18:36,198
DO NOT MAKE SOMEBODY DIS--

546
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:37,031
[door closes]

547
00:18:37,031 --> 00:18:39,659
DISAPPEAR.

548
00:18:39,659 --> 00:18:42,246
[phone ringing]

549
00:18:42,246 --> 00:18:45,332
[cartoonish sounds]

550
00:18:45,332 --> 00:18:48,835
[shouting, jeering]

551
00:18:48,835 --> 00:18:52,797
- NOW THERE'S SOMEONE WHO 
COULD HAVE USED A GOOD MOTHER.

552
00:18:52,797 --> 00:18:54,133
WHORE!

553
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:56,218
narrator: AND SO 
BEFORE OSCAR COULD LEAVE

554
00:18:56,218 --> 00:18:58,803
TO FIND HIS LADY LOVE--

555
00:18:58,803 --> 00:18:59,888
- OSCAR!

556
00:18:59,888 --> 00:19:01,431
narrator: SHE FOUND HIM.

557
00:19:01,431 --> 00:19:02,307
- LUCILLE!

558
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:05,935
YOU LOOK FANTASTIC!

559
00:19:05,935 --> 00:19:08,397
YOU STILL HAVE THE NECK 
OF A 20-YEAR-OLD.

560
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:11,608
- AND YOU STILL HAVE 
THE HAIR OF A LION.

561
00:19:11,608 --> 00:19:12,526
- [laughing]

562
00:19:12,526 --> 00:19:15,320
- TAKE BACK THE LAND.

563
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:16,655
- THAT'S IT?

564
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:19,658
BUT I-I THOUGHT 
WE COULD HAVE

565
00:19:19,658 --> 00:19:23,162
THIS BRIEF MOMENT 
TO RECONNECT.

566
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:26,456
- OSCAR. YOUR BROTHER 
IS IN JAIL RIGHT NOW.

567
00:19:26,456 --> 00:19:27,957
MY HUSBAND IS IN JAIL.

568
00:19:27,957 --> 00:19:30,126
- [sighing] 
YOU'RE RIGHT.

569
00:19:30,126 --> 00:19:32,254
- SO WHAT'S THE RUSH?

570
00:19:36,090 --> 00:19:37,259
narrator: AND THE NEXT DAY--

571
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:38,677
- MICHAEL!

572
00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:41,263
- HEY, MOM! HI. 
LISTEN.

573
00:19:41,263 --> 00:19:42,597
I'M SORRY ABOUT YESTERDAY.

574
00:19:42,597 --> 00:19:43,848
IT WAS A MOMENT OF WEAKNESS.

575
00:19:43,848 --> 00:19:45,475
NOW I-I GOTTA GO INTO 
THIS BOARD MEETING.

576
00:19:45,475 --> 00:19:46,851
I'M JUST 
GONNA TELL THEM THE TRUTH.

577
00:19:46,851 --> 00:19:48,645
IF THIS GUY JORDAN WANTS 
TO TRY TO GET ME FIRED,

578
00:19:48,645 --> 00:19:50,146
THEN MAYBE I DESERVE IT.

579
00:19:50,146 --> 00:19:52,357
- HE'S GONE. 
WE BOUGHT OUT HIS SHARES.

580
00:19:52,357 --> 00:19:53,442
- WITH WHAT?

581
00:19:53,442 --> 00:19:57,362
- WITH THE MONEY YOU TRIED TO 
SPEND ON THAT LEMON GROVE.

582
00:19:57,362 --> 00:19:59,198
- YOU GOT IT BACK. HOW?

583
00:20:01,283 --> 00:20:03,285
- [shushing]

584
00:20:03,285 --> 00:20:04,994
- YOU KNOW ABOUT WHAT I WAS 
SAYING

585
00:20:04,994 --> 00:20:07,372
ABOUT HOW PEOPLE 
OUTLIVE THEIR USEFULNESS?

586
00:20:07,372 --> 00:20:08,457
THAT WAS OUT OF LINE.

587
00:20:08,457 --> 00:20:10,500
- I KNOW.

588
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:13,212
BUT YOU MADE A GOOD POINT.

589
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:15,297
MAYBE I DO NEED SOMETHING 
TO OCCUPY MY TIME,

590
00:20:15,297 --> 00:20:16,756
OTHER THAN MY CHILDREN.

591
00:20:16,756 --> 00:20:18,592
- WELL, IF YOU DO WANT 
TO SPEND IT TOGETHER,

592
00:20:18,592 --> 00:20:19,676
IT'S FINE WITH ME.

593
00:20:19,676 --> 00:20:22,011
- I'M SO GLAD TO HEAR THAT.

594
00:20:28,352 --> 00:20:29,018
- [sighs]

595
00:20:29,018 --> 00:20:30,895
- ALL RIGHT.

596
00:20:30,895 --> 00:20:33,232
LET'S GET THIS 
MEETING STARTED.

597
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:36,943
WHY HAVE WE BEEN SPENDING 
SO MUCH MONEY ON WHISTLES?

598
00:20:39,946 --> 00:20:42,282
narrator: ON THE NEXT 
"ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT."

599
00:20:42,282 --> 00:20:45,619
MICHAEL FINDS HAVING HIS MOTHER 
ON THE BOARD PROBLEMATIC.

600
00:20:45,619 --> 00:20:47,287
- WE HAVE TO BE COURAGEOUS.

601
00:20:47,287 --> 00:20:49,456
- I REMEMBER A CERTAIN YOUNG 
MAN WHO USED TO SAY

602
00:20:49,456 --> 00:20:52,584
"BUT I DON'T HAVE BAD DREAMS 
IN YOUR BED!"

603
00:20:52,584 --> 00:20:53,627
[laughing wildly]

604
00:20:53,627 --> 00:20:55,003
- THAT WAS BUSTER.

605
00:20:55,003 --> 00:20:57,046
narrator: LINDSAY FINDS 
HER TRUE CALLING:

606
00:20:57,046 --> 00:21:01,426
- I WANT TO BE 
A CAGE DANCER.

607
00:21:01,426 --> 00:21:02,844
[laughing]

608
00:21:02,844 --> 00:21:04,471
narrator: 
AND OSCAR COMES A-COURTIN'.

609
00:21:04,471 --> 00:21:06,556
- [singing] ALL YOU NEED ARE 
SMILES

610
00:21:06,556 --> 00:21:07,682
- WHAT'S THAT RACKET?

611
00:21:07,682 --> 00:21:10,394
- [singing] LOTS AND LOTS OF 
SMILEY SMILES

612
00:21:10,394 --> 00:21:13,813
YOUR SWEET PEA MOUTH 
GOES NORTH NOT SOUTH

613
00:21:13,813 --> 00:21:15,857
AND JUST SMILES
