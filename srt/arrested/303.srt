00:00:01,334 --> 00:00:02,543
narrator: NOW THE STORY

2
00:00:02,543 --> 00:00:04,379
OF A WEALTHY FAMILY 
WHO LOST EVERYTHING

3
00:00:04,379 --> 00:00:06,089
AND THE ONE SON 
WHO HAD NO CHOICE

4
00:00:06,089 --> 00:00:08,049
BUT TO KEEP THEM ALL TOGETHER.

5
00:00:13,763 --> 00:00:15,681
IT'S "ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT."

6
00:00:18,101 --> 00:00:20,020
MICHAEL BLUTH AND HIS FAMILY

7
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:22,063
WERE MEETING 
WITH THEIR NEW ATTORNEY.

8
00:00:22,063 --> 00:00:24,190
- LOOK, THIS IS NOT THE FIRST 
TIME I'VE BEEN BROUGHT IN

9
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:25,358
TO REPLACE BARRY ZUCKERKORN.

10
00:00:25,358 --> 00:00:26,734
I THINK I CAN DO FOR YOU 
EVERYTHING HE DID,

11
00:00:26,734 --> 00:00:29,529
PLUS SKEW YOUNGER 
WITH JURIES AND SO FORTH.

12
00:00:29,529 --> 00:00:31,239
ANY OTHER QUESTIONS?

13
00:00:31,239 --> 00:00:32,990
- YES. HOW CAN YOU BE 
EVEN CUTER IN PERSON

14
00:00:32,990 --> 00:00:34,825
THAN YOU ARE IN YOUR ADS?

15
00:00:34,825 --> 00:00:36,911
- ARE YOU A C.E.O., C.F.O. 
OR OTHER EXECUTIVE

16
00:00:36,911 --> 00:00:39,372
FACING THESE 
OR SIMILAR CHARGES?

17
00:00:39,372 --> 00:00:44,960
- WHY SHOULD YOU GO TO JAIL FOR 
A CRIME SOMEONE ELSE NOTICED?

18
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:48,339
YOU DON'T NEED DOUBLE-TALK. 
YOU NEED BOB LOBLAW.

19
00:00:48,339 --> 00:00:50,883
- BOB LOBLAW NO HABLA ESPANOL.

20
00:00:50,883 --> 00:00:53,094
- WELL, WE'RE NOT HERE TO TALK 
NONSENSE TO BOB LOBLAW.

21
00:00:53,094 --> 00:00:54,179
WE NEED TO FIND OUT

22
00:00:54,179 --> 00:00:55,555
IF THE GOVERNMENT HAS 
A GOOD CASE AGAINST US.

23
00:00:55,555 --> 00:00:56,972
I MEAN, THERE IS 
A LOT OF PROOF

24
00:00:56,972 --> 00:00:58,683
THAT MY FATHER 
WAS BUILDING HOUSES IN IRAQ.

25
00:00:58,683 --> 00:01:00,393
- WELL, YOUR FATHER CLAIMS 
HE WAS PUT UP TO IT

26
00:01:00,393 --> 00:01:01,394
BY A BRITISH SYNDICATE.

27
00:01:01,394 --> 00:01:03,438
AND YOU'VE BEEN THREATENED. 
ISN'T THAT CORRECT?

28
00:01:03,438 --> 00:01:04,064
narrator: IT WAS.

29
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:05,398
- HOW WOULD YOU LIKE SOMEONE

30
00:01:05,398 --> 00:01:07,358
GOING AFTER SOME STUPID PERSON 
IN YOUR FAMILY?

31
00:01:07,358 --> 00:01:10,236
NOW, BACK OFF, 
YOU [bleep] PONCE!

32
00:01:10,236 --> 00:01:12,029
- IT'S BEEN A WEEK. 
NOTHING'S HAPPENED.

33
00:01:12,029 --> 00:01:14,282
- YEAH, BUT YOU'RE NOT THE ONE 
STUCK UNDER HOUSE ARREST

34
00:01:14,282 --> 00:01:15,825
LIKE A SITTING DUCK.

35
00:01:15,825 --> 00:01:17,285
- OH, YEAH. 
THAT'S MY FATHER.

36
00:01:17,285 --> 00:01:19,912
THAT'S WHY WE HAD THE MEETING 
HERE--SO HE COULDN'T INTERFERE.

37
00:01:19,912 --> 00:01:20,955
- INTERFERE?

38
00:01:20,955 --> 00:01:23,833
I OUGHTA PULL DOWN YOUR PANTS 
AND SPANK YOUR ASS RAW.

39
00:01:23,833 --> 00:01:26,336
- I'M SORRY. 
HAVE WE MET?

40
00:01:26,336 --> 00:01:27,920
- OH, YES. 
THIS IS LARRY MIDDLEMAN.

41
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,839
HE'S YOUR FATHER'S SURROGATE.

42
00:01:29,839 --> 00:01:30,798
- SURROGATE?

43
00:01:30,798 --> 00:01:32,217
- THAT'S RIGHT, 
YOU DUMB [bleep].

44
00:01:32,217 --> 00:01:34,302
- I HIRED THIS GUY TO WEAR 
A CAMERA IN HIS HAT

45
00:01:34,302 --> 00:01:35,678
SO HE COULD BE MY EYES 
AND EARS

46
00:01:35,678 --> 00:01:37,180
WHILE I'M STUCK 
IN THIS PENTHOUSE.

47
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:40,308
- THIS CAMERA HELPS ME 
KEEP TABS ON YOU IDIOTS

48
00:01:40,308 --> 00:01:42,518
WHILE THIS THING 
RUBS MY ANKLE RAW.

49
00:01:42,518 --> 00:01:44,604
- I MEAN, LOOK AT THIS THING.

50
00:01:44,604 --> 00:01:46,063
- I CAN'T EVEN GO 
IN THE HALLWAY--

51
00:01:46,063 --> 00:01:49,525
- WITHOUT HEARING THAT-- 
- BEEP, BEEP, BEEP.

52
00:01:49,525 --> 00:01:52,403
- THAT'S ONE OF MY PARTNERS. 
EXCUSE ME.

53
00:01:52,403 --> 00:01:54,864
- UH, I-I WOULD LIKE TO BE 
ONE OF YOUR PARTNERS.

54
00:01:54,864 --> 00:01:57,825
DO YOU THINK HE GOT THAT? 
TH-THE TWO MEANINGS?

55
00:01:57,825 --> 00:01:59,869
- HE'S RUNNING PRETTY FAST. 
I THINK HE DID.

56
00:01:59,869 --> 00:02:01,912
- WELL, HE WAS FLIRTING EARLIER. 
I'LL TELL YOU THAT.

57
00:02:01,912 --> 00:02:04,874
JUST SO YOU KNOW, 
I'M LOOKING TO GET DIVORCED.

58
00:02:04,874 --> 00:02:05,833
ARE YOU INTERESTED?

59
00:02:05,833 --> 00:02:08,085
- YES.

60
00:02:11,214 --> 00:02:13,299
LET'S CALL THAT A HALF HOUR.

61
00:02:13,299 --> 00:02:15,260
- SO YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY ONE 
WHO'S GOT A DATE LATER.

62
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:16,261
- YOU'VE GOT A DATE?

63
00:02:16,261 --> 00:02:17,262
- HER NAME'S RITA.

64
00:02:17,262 --> 00:02:18,929
SHE TEACHES CHILDREN 
AT A PRIVATE SCHOOL,

65
00:02:18,929 --> 00:02:20,055
AND WE'RE JUST HAVING LUNCH.

66
00:02:20,055 --> 00:02:22,308
- OH, LUNCH. WELL, BETTER 
BRING SOME DOG FOOD.

67
00:02:22,308 --> 00:02:24,185
'CAUSE ALL THE GIRLS YOU DATE 
ARE DOGS.

68
00:02:24,185 --> 00:02:26,396
DOGS LOVE DOG FOOD, 
RIGHT, POP?

69
00:02:26,396 --> 00:02:28,731
- SHUT UP, YOU IDIOT. 
I'M TRYING TO WATCH THE GAME.

70
00:02:28,731 --> 00:02:30,150
- JUST TRYING 
TO MAKE YOU LAUGH, DAD.

71
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:32,402
IT'S ALL I EVER WANT.

72
00:02:32,402 --> 00:02:34,069
- SMITH THE CATCHER--

73
00:02:34,069 --> 00:02:35,530
- YOU KNOW, GOB, 
SHE'S NOT A DOG.

74
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:36,947
IT'S JUST THE OPPOSITE ACTUALLY.

75
00:02:36,947 --> 00:02:38,408
SHE'S EXQUISITELY BEAUTIFUL.

76
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:42,119
SHE'S FUN, CAREFREE, SMART, 
FULL OF SURPRISES.

77
00:02:42,119 --> 00:02:43,496
narrator: INCLUDING THE FACT

78
00:02:43,496 --> 00:02:45,665
THAT SHE WAS WORKING 
WITH THIS MAN,

79
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:48,083
WHO WAS CURRENTLY 
DROPPING HER OFF FOR HER DATE.

80
00:02:48,083 --> 00:02:49,585
- NOW ALL THIS FUN 
AND CAREFREE ACT

81
00:02:49,585 --> 00:02:51,546
IS ONLY GONNA FOOL HIM 
FOR SO LONG.

82
00:02:51,546 --> 00:02:52,588
- I'M A BIG GIRL.

83
00:02:52,588 --> 00:02:55,341
- YEAH. WELL, IF HE FINDS OUT 
WHAT YOU REALLY ARE,

84
00:02:55,341 --> 00:02:58,135
HE MIGHT NOT MAKE THINGS 
SO SIMPLE FOR YOU.

85
00:02:58,135 --> 00:03:00,513
RITA, DON'T FORGET YOUR HAT.

86
00:03:05,518 --> 00:03:07,395
- AND WHO AM I KIDDING? 
SHE'S TOO GOOD FOR ME.

87
00:03:07,395 --> 00:03:08,479
- HOW DO YOU THINK I FEEL?

88
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:11,524
BOB LOBLAW'S A HANDSOME, 
PROFESSIONAL MAN,

89
00:03:11,524 --> 00:03:14,193
AND I'M ONLY USED TO-- 
WELL, NONE OF THOSE THINGS.

90
00:03:14,193 --> 00:03:15,861
- OKAY, LINDSAY, 
ARE YOU FORGETTING

91
00:03:15,861 --> 00:03:17,405
THAT I WAS 
A PROFESSIONAL TWICE OVER?

92
00:03:17,405 --> 00:03:21,242
AN ANALYST AND A THERAPIST. 
THE WORLD'S FIRST "ANALRAPIST."

93
00:03:21,242 --> 00:03:22,827
- YES, AND YOU 
WERE ALMOST ARRESTED

94
00:03:22,827 --> 00:03:24,912
FOR THOSE BUSINESS CARDS.

95
00:03:24,912 --> 00:03:26,664
- YES. NO, IT DID NOT LOOK GOOD 
ON PAPER,

96
00:03:26,664 --> 00:03:28,791
BUT I DIDN'T STOP BECAUSE 
OF THE POLICE INQUIRIES.

97
00:03:28,791 --> 00:03:30,960
I STOPPED TO RAISE 
OUR LITTLE DAUGHTER.

98
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,795
BUT SINCE WE BOTH 
HAVE STARTED TO GROW HAIR

99
00:03:32,795 --> 00:03:34,547
IN UNEXPECTED PLACES,

100
00:03:34,547 --> 00:03:37,508
I SUPPOSE I SHALL SOON 
BE WORKING AS A LEADING MAN,

101
00:03:37,508 --> 00:03:39,802
AND SHE MAY SOON 
START DATING.

102
00:03:39,802 --> 00:03:42,472
narrator: MAEBY HAD ALREADY 
STARTED DATING.

103
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:44,640
- ANOTHER DATE 
WITH, UH, STEVE HOLT?

104
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,809
- YEAH. WE'RE GETTIN' 
PRETTY SERIOUS.

105
00:03:46,809 --> 00:03:48,060
narrator: THEY WEREN'T.

106
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:51,063
SHE WAS JUST AVOIDING HER 
REAL CRUSH ON GEORGE MICHAEL.

107
00:03:51,063 --> 00:03:53,065
- THAT STEVE SURE KNOWS 
HOW TO PLEASE A LADY.

108
00:03:53,065 --> 00:03:56,569
- GOOD. I WAS HOPING 
HE WOULD BE GIFTED SEXUALLY.

109
00:03:56,569 --> 00:03:58,404
I MEAN, I GUESS IT MAKES SENSE.

110
00:03:58,404 --> 00:04:00,531
YOU KNOW, UH, OLDER GUYS 
EXPECT CERTAIN THINGS.

111
00:04:00,531 --> 00:04:01,407
- THEY DO?

112
00:04:01,407 --> 00:04:03,784
- WHAT A FUN, SEXY TIME FOR YOU.

113
00:04:03,784 --> 00:04:06,036
- I'D BE VERY CAREFUL 
OF THESE BRITISH PEOPLE.

114
00:04:06,036 --> 00:04:07,455
THEY'RE GONNA TRY TO GET 
THEIR HANDS

115
00:04:07,455 --> 00:04:09,206
ON ANY EVIDENCE 
THEY CAN TO HURT THE FAMILY.

116
00:04:09,206 --> 00:04:11,208
- SO YOU'RE SAYING 
SHRED THE EVIDENCE?

117
00:04:11,208 --> 00:04:12,335
- NO, THAT'S ILLEGAL.

118
00:04:12,335 --> 00:04:14,545
THE PROSECUTION IS ENTITLED 
TO THAT EVIDENCE.

119
00:04:14,545 --> 00:04:15,921
WITHOUT IT, 
THEY DON'T HAVE A CASE.

120
00:04:15,921 --> 00:04:17,465
- SO YOU'RE SAYING 
SHRED THE EVIDENCE?

121
00:04:17,465 --> 00:04:18,466
- THAT'S A FELONY.

122
00:04:18,466 --> 00:04:20,593
AND I CERTAINLY COULDN'T 
ENDORSE ANYTHING LIKE THAT.

123
00:04:20,593 --> 00:04:22,637
- GOT YA. WINK.

124
00:04:22,637 --> 00:04:25,222
- WINK. DID YOU SAY WINK?

125
00:04:25,222 --> 00:04:26,181
OR DID YOU WINK?

126
00:04:26,181 --> 00:04:27,850
- HE SAID THAT TOO, DAD.

127
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:29,810
- WE'LL TALK SOON, FOLKS. 
THANK YOU.

128
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:32,605
- WHERE YOU GOING? 
WHERE IS THE SURROGATE GOING?

129
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:35,275
STAY THERE. I WANT TO SEE WHAT 
HE'S GONNA SAY. DON'T LEAVE.

130
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:36,401
- SEE YA, POP.

131
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:37,652
- YOU KNOW, GOB,

132
00:04:37,652 --> 00:04:40,446
INSTEAD OF TRYING TO IMPRESS 
YOUR FAKE FATHER,

133
00:04:40,446 --> 00:04:42,698
MAYBE YOU SHOULD SPEND 
SOME TIME WITH YOUR REAL SON.

134
00:04:42,698 --> 00:04:43,866
- STEVE HOLT'S NOT MY SON.

135
00:04:43,866 --> 00:04:45,951
- STEVE HOLT? 
THE MORON JOCK?

136
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:48,538
- THAT'S MY SON, 
YOU POTHEAD.

137
00:04:48,538 --> 00:04:49,622
- HEY, THAT'S MY SON!

138
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:52,249
- WAIT. SO THAT MEANS THAT 
STEVE HOLT IS MY COUSIN?

139
00:04:52,249 --> 00:04:53,418
AND MAEBY'S COUSIN TOO.

140
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:55,878
- I GUESS. SHOOT, 
I'M LATE FOR MY DATE.

141
00:04:55,878 --> 00:04:57,922
- YEAH. AT THE KENNEL! 
[laughs]

142
00:04:57,922 --> 00:04:59,131
[door opens, closes]

143
00:04:59,131 --> 00:05:02,009
SORRY, YOU LOBBED THAT ONE 
RIGHT OVER THE PLATE, MICHAEL.

144
00:05:02,009 --> 00:05:03,010
HOME RUN.

145
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:04,345
narrator: 
AND MICHAEL HURRIED

146
00:05:04,345 --> 00:05:06,472
TO THE BRITISH SECTION 
OF ORANGE COUNTY FOR HIS DATE.

147
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:08,474
- CRAZY AMERICAN! 
GET OUT OF THE ROAD!

148
00:05:08,474 --> 00:05:10,393
narrator: ONLY TO FIND 
THAT RITA HAD CHOSEN

149
00:05:10,393 --> 00:05:13,604
WEE BRITAIN'S 
ONE AMERICAN-THEMED RESTAURANT.

150
00:05:13,604 --> 00:05:16,148
- OH, HELLO. 
I'M SORRY I'M LATE.

151
00:05:16,148 --> 00:05:17,650
- OH, NO BOTHER.

152
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:19,819
I'VE BEEN HAVING 
SUCH FUN ON THIS SPACESHIP.

153
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:22,488
- STRIKE ONE, HUH? 
SHALL WE GO AHEAD AND SIT DOWN?

154
00:05:26,033 --> 00:05:30,037
- HEY, DUDES, I'LL GET YOU 
A COUPLE OF 64-OUNCE COLAS

155
00:05:30,037 --> 00:05:32,832
TO WASH DOWN 
THIS BASKET OF DOUGHNUTS

156
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:33,958
AND GET YOUR NACHOS--

157
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:36,335
- I GUESS THIS IS WHAT 
THE BRITISH THINK OF AMERICANS.

158
00:05:36,335 --> 00:05:37,294
WE LIKE OUR FOOD.

159
00:05:37,294 --> 00:05:39,129
- WHATEVER DO YOU MEAN?

160
00:05:39,129 --> 00:05:41,382
- [laughs] 
YEAH.

161
00:05:41,382 --> 00:05:42,550
UH, YOU KNOW, UH, RITA,

162
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:44,385
YOU'RE GONNA FIGURE THIS OUT 
EVENTUALLY,

163
00:05:44,385 --> 00:05:46,679
BUT I HAVE NOT BEEN ON A DATE 
IN A LONG, LONG TIME.

164
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:48,347
- NEITHER HAVE I.

165
00:05:48,347 --> 00:05:49,348
- I WONDER WHY.

166
00:05:49,348 --> 00:05:52,059
I'LL BET MEN 
ASK YOU OUT CONSTANTLY.

167
00:05:52,059 --> 00:05:55,563
- NOT MEN LIKE YOU. I SEEM 
TO ONLY MEET LITTLE BOYS.

168
00:05:55,563 --> 00:05:57,773
- PART OF THAT MIGHT BE THAT YOU 
SPEND YOUR DAY AT A PRESCHOOL.

169
00:05:57,773 --> 00:05:58,774
[laughing]

170
00:05:58,774 --> 00:06:00,359
- AND THEY THINK THE STUPIDEST 
THINGS ARE FUNNY.

171
00:06:00,359 --> 00:06:02,945
- YEAH, THAT'S A CULTURAL 
PROBLEM IS WHAT IT IS, YOU KNOW.

172
00:06:02,945 --> 00:06:04,238
YOUR AVERAGE AMERICAN MALE

173
00:06:04,238 --> 00:06:05,906
IS IN A PERPETUAL 
STATE OF ADOLESCENCE--

174
00:06:05,906 --> 00:06:07,366
YOU KNOW, 
ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT.

175
00:06:07,366 --> 00:06:09,368
narrator: HEY, THAT'S THE NAME 
OF THE SHOW!

176
00:06:09,368 --> 00:06:10,995
- NO ATTENTION SPAN.

177
00:06:10,995 --> 00:06:14,039
YOU KNOW, CAN'T EVEN 
CARRY ON A TYPICAL CONV--

178
00:06:14,039 --> 00:06:15,332
narrator: MICHAEL THOUGHT

179
00:06:15,332 --> 00:06:17,460
HE SPOTTED THE MAN 
WHO'D THREATENED HIM EARLIER.

180
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:20,087
- WELL, I'M GETTIN' BACK 
ON THE SPACE SHUTTLE.

181
00:06:20,087 --> 00:06:22,089
- NO, NO, NO. SORRY. SORRY. 
SIT, PLEASE.

182
00:06:22,089 --> 00:06:24,967
LET'S TALK ABOUT YOU. 
TELL ME ABOUT YOUR FAMILY.

183
00:06:24,967 --> 00:06:28,554
- WELL, THEY'RE PUSHY, BOSSY, 
WANT TO CONTROL ME.

184
00:06:28,554 --> 00:06:29,722
WHAT ABOUT YOUR FAMILY?

185
00:06:29,722 --> 00:06:33,308
I'D LOVE TO MEET YOUR FAMILY.

186
00:06:33,308 --> 00:06:34,852
narrator: 
MICHAEL KNEW FROM EXPERIENCE

187
00:06:34,852 --> 00:06:37,605
THAT THIS 
WOULD NOT TURN OUT WELL.

188
00:06:37,605 --> 00:06:39,023
- ONCE OR TWICE A WEEK, 
WE GET A--

189
00:06:39,023 --> 00:06:41,442
[continues, indistinct]

190
00:06:41,442 --> 00:06:43,486
HAVE A LITTLE MORE.

191
00:06:43,486 --> 00:06:44,612
- IF YOU LIKE THE SMALL,

192
00:06:44,612 --> 00:06:46,363
WHY DON'T YOU COME BACK 
FOR THE MEDIUM?

193
00:06:46,363 --> 00:06:48,323
[laughing]

194
00:06:48,323 --> 00:06:51,410
- [indistinct] RIGHT? 
YOU CAN SEE THAT, RIGHT?

195
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:53,412
I PROBABLY SHOULD WARN YOU 
ABOUT MY MOTHER.

196
00:06:53,412 --> 00:06:54,830
- HI.

197
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:57,041
- LET'S START BEHIND THE FRIDGE.

198
00:06:57,041 --> 00:06:59,334
narrator: SO HE CAME UP WITH 
A SOLUTION SO SIMPLE,

199
00:06:59,334 --> 00:07:02,922
HE WONDERED WHY HE'D 
NEVER TOLD ANYONE IT BEFORE.

200
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:05,841
- I DON'T HAVE A FAMILY.

201
00:07:05,841 --> 00:07:08,678
I CAN'T BELIEVE I'VE NEVER 
TOLD ANYBODY THAT BEFORE.

202
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:10,220
- THAT'S SO SAD.

203
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:12,557
- YES, SAD. SUPER SAD. 
SHALL WE EAT?

204
00:07:17,562 --> 00:07:19,605
narrator: MICHAEL HAD STARTED 
A RELATIONSHIP

205
00:07:19,605 --> 00:07:21,607
BY LYING ABOUT THE EXISTENCE 
OF HIS FAMILY.

206
00:07:21,607 --> 00:07:23,776
- I THINK THIS WENT 
REALLY WELL, HUH?

207
00:07:23,776 --> 00:07:25,319
MAYBE SOMETIME 
WE CAN HAVE DINNER?

208
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:26,487
- COULD I SEE YOUR HOUSE?

209
00:07:26,487 --> 00:07:30,450
narrator: MICHAEL WAS CAUGHT 
OFF-GUARD BY THE QUESTION.

210
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:33,285
- NO. NO. I-I-- 
I CAN'T DO THAT.

211
00:07:33,285 --> 00:07:34,078
- OKAY, BYE-BYE.

212
00:07:34,078 --> 00:07:36,288
- UH, BYE.

213
00:07:36,288 --> 00:07:39,291
narrator: AND HE VOWED NOT TO BE 
CAUGHT OFF-GUARD AGAIN.

214
00:07:39,291 --> 00:07:41,961
- I DIDN'T MEAN THAT WE-- 
[grunts]

215
00:07:41,961 --> 00:07:43,963
- SO DID HE INVITE YOU 
OVER, THEN?

216
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:45,548
- NOT YET, BUT HE WILL.

217
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:48,926
narrator: SO MICHAEL 
WENT BACK TO WORK.

218
00:07:48,926 --> 00:07:50,302
[machines whirring]

219
00:07:50,302 --> 00:07:51,679
- HEY, WHO BROUGHT IN 
THE WOOD--

220
00:07:55,182 --> 00:07:57,685
GOB, YOU CAN'T SHRED 
THIS EVIDENCE.

221
00:07:57,685 --> 00:07:58,936
YOU'LL END UP IN JAIL.

222
00:07:58,936 --> 00:08:00,020
- DAD TOLD ME TO.

223
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:01,939
HOW CAN I SAY NO 
TO THAT FACE?

224
00:08:01,939 --> 00:08:03,357
- GET THIS STUFF OUT OF HERE

225
00:08:03,357 --> 00:08:05,526
AND PUT IT SOMEWHERE 
WHERE DAD CAN'T GET TO IT.

226
00:08:05,526 --> 00:08:06,611
ARE YOU IN ON THIS TOO?

227
00:08:06,611 --> 00:08:11,406
- NO, I'M JUST HERE TO GO OUT 
TO LUNCH WITH YOUR FATHER.

228
00:08:11,406 --> 00:08:13,951
- AND HE SAID HE'S NEVER FELT 
MORE FREE IN HIS LIFE.

229
00:08:13,951 --> 00:08:15,661
- I'M LIKE A BIRD UP THERE.

230
00:08:15,661 --> 00:08:18,247
- DID YOU TELL HIM 
ABOUT MY MEDAL?

231
00:08:18,247 --> 00:08:19,289
- MEDAL? WHAT FOR?

232
00:08:19,289 --> 00:08:21,416
- OH, WHO KNOWS WHAT 
THEY WERE SAYING.

233
00:08:21,416 --> 00:08:25,129
- [rapid muttering]

234
00:08:25,129 --> 00:08:26,338
DO YOU AGREE? 
SAY THANK YOU.

235
00:08:26,338 --> 00:08:28,007
- THANK YOU. WOW.

236
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:30,885
I HAVE SO MANY PEOPLE 
TO THANK.

237
00:08:30,885 --> 00:08:32,344
- PRIVATE ASHER, STEP FORWARD!

238
00:08:32,344 --> 00:08:34,889
- IT'S PROBABLY BECAUSE 
A SEAL BIT OFF HIS HAND.

239
00:08:34,889 --> 00:08:37,600
THE ARMY HAS TAKEN TO GIVING 
MEDALS FOR BEING FOOD.

240
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,643
- HUH.

241
00:08:38,643 --> 00:08:39,519
narrator: JUST THEN--

242
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,729
- WOW, LOOK AT HIM GO 
TIED TO THAT DECK CHAIR!

243
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:45,024
- IT'S SO SIMPLE. 
MY ANKLE MONITOR--

244
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:47,442
- ONLY GOES OFF WHEN 
I GO OUT THE FRONT DOOR.

245
00:08:47,442 --> 00:08:49,904
WE NEED BALLOONS. 
A PARTY!

246
00:08:49,904 --> 00:08:51,196
- WE NEED TO THROW A PARTY FOR--

247
00:08:51,196 --> 00:08:52,573
- BUSTER'S STUPID THING.

248
00:08:52,573 --> 00:08:54,491
LARRY, GO GET SOME BALLOONS.

249
00:08:54,491 --> 00:08:56,035
narrator: AND MICHAEL 
FOUND A WAY

250
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:57,745
TO GET RITA 
TO HIS HOUSE AFTER ALL.

251
00:08:57,745 --> 00:09:00,581
- THAT'S A GREAT IDEA. 
HONOR BUSTER TOMORROW NIGHT.

252
00:09:00,581 --> 00:09:02,667
WE'LL GET THE WHOLE FAMILY 
OVER TO THE PENTHOUSE,

253
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:04,001
SHOW HIM OUR SUPPORT.

254
00:09:04,001 --> 00:09:06,003
- WELL, I SUPPOSE IT'S BETTER 
THAN DRINKING ALONE.

255
00:09:06,003 --> 00:09:07,296
WHAT TIME?

256
00:09:07,296 --> 00:09:08,463
- DOESN'T MATTER TO ME.

257
00:09:08,463 --> 00:09:10,550
I CAN'T BE THERE. 
I'VE GOT A DATE WITH RITA.

258
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:13,260
- [chuckles] 
WELL, MOM'S PROBABLY RIGHT.

259
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:15,095
I COULDN'T EVEN 
STAND UP TO A SEAL.

260
00:09:15,095 --> 00:09:17,056
I DON'T REALLY DESERVE 
A MEDAL OR A PARTY.

261
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:20,142
- NO, YOU DESERVE THIS. 
HERE, TAKE MY BUSINESS CARD.

262
00:09:20,142 --> 00:09:21,101
- [gasps]

263
00:09:21,101 --> 00:09:22,978
- NO, NO. IT'S PRONOUNCED 
"A-NALRA-PIST."

264
00:09:22,978 --> 00:09:25,189
- IT WASN'T REALLY THE 
PRONUNCIATION THAT BOTHERED ME.

265
00:09:25,189 --> 00:09:26,273
- YOU SEE, BUSTER,

266
00:09:26,273 --> 00:09:28,693
IT WASN'T THE SEAL THAT 
YOU COULDN'T STAND UP TO.

267
00:09:28,693 --> 00:09:30,152
IT WAS LUCILLE.

268
00:09:30,152 --> 00:09:31,278
- [gasps] 
- [gasps]

269
00:09:31,278 --> 00:09:33,864
OH, I'M GETTING CHILLS.

270
00:09:33,864 --> 00:09:36,659
IF THIS WAS A LIFETIME 
MOMENT OF TRUTH MOVIE,

271
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:38,243
THIS WOULD BE 
OUR ACT BREAK.

272
00:09:38,243 --> 00:09:39,494
[banjo]

273
00:09:39,494 --> 00:09:41,914
narrator: 
BUT IT WASN'T.

274
00:09:41,914 --> 00:09:45,334
AND LATER, LINDSAY WAS 
ON THE PHONE WITH BOB LOBLAW.

275
00:09:45,334 --> 00:09:48,629
- I LOVE TOBIAS, BUT HE'S 
NEVER FULFILLED ME SEXUALLY.

276
00:09:48,629 --> 00:09:50,673
- CAN YOU CATALOG FOR ME 
THE VARIOUS WAYS

277
00:09:50,673 --> 00:09:52,675
YOU'VE BEEN 
PROMISED TO BE FULFILLED,

278
00:09:52,675 --> 00:09:54,760
WHETHER OR NOT SAID PROMISE 
WAS MADE EXPLICIT?

279
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:55,928
- YOU WANT ME TO BE EXPLICIT?

280
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:57,179
- YES.

281
00:09:57,179 --> 00:09:59,556
BUT I WILL BE NEEDING 
TO GET OFF IN FOUR MINUTES.

282
00:09:59,556 --> 00:10:03,352
- WELL, LET'S SEE IF I CAN'T 
HIT THAT TARGET FOR YOU.

283
00:10:03,352 --> 00:10:05,938
narrator: THE NEXT DAY, 
ON THE WAY TO PICK UP RITA,

284
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:07,314
MICHAEL STOPPED BY HIS HOUSE

285
00:10:07,314 --> 00:10:10,943
TO MAKE SURE THERE WERE 
NO SIGNS OF HIS FAMILY,

286
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:13,153
ONLY TO DISCOVER 
THERE WAS NOTHING BUT.

287
00:10:13,153 --> 00:10:14,404
- WHAT THE HELL IS ALL THIS?

288
00:10:14,404 --> 00:10:16,198
- OH, GOB 
BROUGHT ALL THIS STUFF IN.

289
00:10:16,198 --> 00:10:18,533
- AND, MOM, WHAT IS WITH 
ALL THE FAMILY PHOTOS?

290
00:10:18,533 --> 00:10:21,704
- OH, I'M TEACHING BUSTER 
TO STAND UP FOR HIMSELF.

291
00:10:21,704 --> 00:10:23,080
I'M SURROGATING YOUR MOTHER.

292
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,999
- BY WEARING 
HER SEALSKIN COAT?

293
00:10:24,999 --> 00:10:26,751
- MICHAEL, I HAVE TRIED ON 
EVERYTHING,

294
00:10:26,751 --> 00:10:28,043
AND NOTHING 
SEEMS TO BE WORKING.

295
00:10:28,043 --> 00:10:29,419
- I THOUGHT 
THE DONNA KARAN WORKED.

296
00:10:29,419 --> 00:10:31,296
YOU JUST DIDN'T 
HAVE THE RIGHT SHOES.

297
00:10:31,296 --> 00:10:33,423
- LOOK, I'VE GOTTA GET RID 
OF ANY EVIDENCE OF MY FAMILY,

298
00:10:33,423 --> 00:10:35,259
AND QUICKLY 
INCLUDING YOU GUYS.

299
00:10:35,259 --> 00:10:36,218
GET OUTTA HERE!

300
00:10:36,218 --> 00:10:38,679
- SEE? NOW, THAT'S HOW 
YOU STAND UP TO MOTHER.

301
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:39,889
- GET OUT OF HERE!

302
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:41,891
narrator: MEANWHILE, 
WORRIED ABOUT STEVE HOLT'S

303
00:10:41,891 --> 00:10:44,769
SEXUAL EXPECTATIONS, 
MAEBY TRIED TO CANCEL HER DATE.

304
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:47,354
- MY WHOLE FAMILY AND I NOW HAVE 
TO GO TO MY GRANDMA'S HOUSE

305
00:10:47,354 --> 00:10:48,773
BECAUSE MY UNCLE 
LOST HIS HAND.

306
00:10:48,773 --> 00:10:49,982
- AWESOME!

307
00:10:49,982 --> 00:10:51,859
SO YOU AND I CAN PARTY 
ALONE AT YOUR HOUSE.

308
00:10:51,859 --> 00:10:54,569
narrator: MAEBY WAS TOO YOUNG 
TO KNOW WHAT TO DO.

309
00:10:54,569 --> 00:10:58,573
IRONICALLY, IN HER AFTER-SCHOOL 
JOB AS A MOVIE STUDIO EXECUTIVE,

310
00:10:58,573 --> 00:11:02,411
SHE'D JUST GREEN-LIT TWO FILMS 
THAT DEALT WITH THE VERY ISSUE.

311
00:11:02,411 --> 00:11:05,205
- ROCK THE HOUSE. 
- ALL RIGHT.

312
00:11:05,205 --> 00:11:07,750
narrator: GEORGE MICHAEL ALSO 
DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.

313
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:09,543
IF HE POINTED OUT 
THAT THE TWO WERE COUSINS

314
00:11:09,543 --> 00:11:11,045
TO DRIVE THEM APART,

315
00:11:11,045 --> 00:11:12,629
HE MIGHT BE BURNING 
THE VERY BRIDGE

316
00:11:12,629 --> 00:11:14,423
THAT HE ONE DAY 
HOPED TO CROSS.

317
00:11:14,423 --> 00:11:15,716
- I'M DOING 
YOUR COUSIN TONIGHT.

318
00:11:15,716 --> 00:11:17,009
- SO ARE YOU.

319
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:20,387
- WHAT? 
- SHE'S YOUR COUSIN TOO.

320
00:11:20,387 --> 00:11:21,889
narrator: BACK AT THE PENTHOUSE,

321
00:11:21,889 --> 00:11:24,016
PARTY PREPARATIONS 
WERE UNDERWAY.

322
00:11:24,016 --> 00:11:25,642
- HE'S NOT WEARING THAT 
TO THE PARTY.

323
00:11:25,642 --> 00:11:26,852
I'VE GOT 
THE EXACT SAME THING.

324
00:11:26,852 --> 00:11:28,687
- NO, HE WAS JUST 
ANALRAPING ME.

325
00:11:28,687 --> 00:11:30,314
THEN MICHAEL BARGED IN 
AND KICKED US OUT

326
00:11:30,314 --> 00:11:32,066
SO HE COULD SHRED 
ALL THE EVIDENCE.

327
00:11:32,066 --> 00:11:33,358
- SHRED THE EVIDENCE?

328
00:11:33,358 --> 00:11:34,985
- I THOUGHT HE DIDN'T 
WANT US TO DO THAT.

329
00:11:34,985 --> 00:11:36,528
- HE DIDN'T WANT US 
TO GET INTO TROUBLE.

330
00:11:36,528 --> 00:11:38,363
HE'S TAKING THE HEAT.

331
00:11:38,363 --> 00:11:40,199
- HE'S DOING THAT FOR US?

332
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:42,076
AND ON THE NIGHT 
OF HIS DATE WITH RITA.

333
00:11:42,076 --> 00:11:43,744
- WHO HE DIDN'T WANT 
TO BRING OVER HERE.

334
00:11:43,744 --> 00:11:45,454
PROBABLY BECAUSE-- 
LET'S FACE IT--

335
00:11:45,454 --> 00:11:48,082
YOU PEOPLE HAVEN'T BEEN 
GREAT WITH THE OTHERS.

336
00:11:48,082 --> 00:11:50,960
- WELL, IN OUR DEFENSE, MOM, 
WE'RE NOT EXACTLY DOG PEOPLE.

337
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,419
- WE HAVE GOT TO START 
BEING NICER.

338
00:11:52,419 --> 00:11:54,421
- I'M STARTING RIGHT NOW.

339
00:11:54,421 --> 00:11:56,048
BUSTER, THE PARTY'S 
NOT FOR YOU ANYMORE.

340
00:11:56,048 --> 00:11:57,091
- OH, OKAY.

341
00:11:57,091 --> 00:11:59,551
- IT'S A "WELCOME RITA" PARTY.

342
00:11:59,551 --> 00:12:00,719
- I KNOW WHERE SHE WORKS.

343
00:12:00,719 --> 00:12:02,054
WE CAN PICK HER UP 
AND SURPRISE HER.

344
00:12:02,054 --> 00:12:03,097
- YOU'RE SO RIGHT.

345
00:12:03,097 --> 00:12:05,766
THIS IS BETTER 
THAN A PARTY FOR ME.

346
00:12:05,766 --> 00:12:08,685
- OH, COME ON. 
GROW A PAIR.

347
00:12:10,479 --> 00:12:12,815
- YOU KNOW, WE NEED SOME WEATHER 
BALLOONS FOR THIS PARTY,

348
00:12:12,815 --> 00:12:14,733
AND MAYBE A TANK OF HYDROGEN.

349
00:12:14,733 --> 00:12:15,985
[thud, car alarm blaring]

350
00:12:15,985 --> 00:12:17,652
YOU KNOW, REALLY 
FLOAT THOSE SUCKERS.

351
00:12:17,652 --> 00:12:19,822
narrator: MEANWHILE, MICHAEL 
WAS HIDING THE EVIDENCE

352
00:12:19,822 --> 00:12:22,616
WHEREVER HE COULD 
WHEN HE HEARD FROM HIS BROTHER.

353
00:12:22,616 --> 00:12:26,078
- HEY, FRIEND. GOB HERE. 
WE REALLY WANT YOU AT THE PARTY.

354
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:30,249
WE'RE REALLY NICE NOW. 
AND, GOD, WE LOVE YOU.

355
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:32,835
- [sighs] 
DAMN IT.

356
00:12:32,835 --> 00:12:35,462
narrator: AND THE FAMILY PICKED 
UP RITA IN THE ONLY VEHICLE

357
00:12:35,462 --> 00:12:36,713
BIG ENOUGH TO HOLD THEM ALL.

358
00:12:36,713 --> 00:12:37,882
- HEY, HEY. 
EXCUSE ME. RITA?

359
00:12:37,882 --> 00:12:38,841
- I'M RITA.

360
00:12:38,841 --> 00:12:41,593
- WE'RE HERE TO PICK YOU UP 
FOR MICHAEL.

361
00:12:41,593 --> 00:12:43,804
UH, YOU CAN JUST 
GO IN THE CABIN.

362
00:12:47,892 --> 00:12:48,725
- MICHAEL?

363
00:12:48,725 --> 00:12:51,478
- OH, HE'S NOT HERE.

364
00:12:51,478 --> 00:12:52,437
WE'RE HIS FAMILY.

365
00:12:52,437 --> 00:12:54,982
- OH, HIS FAMILY.

366
00:12:54,982 --> 00:12:55,900
- WE'RE NICE.

367
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:58,152
- I'M SORRY. I HAVE TO LEAVE.

368
00:12:58,152 --> 00:13:00,612
- OH, NO, YOU CANNOT LEAVE. 
DRIVE, LINDSAY!

369
00:13:00,612 --> 00:13:02,239
- [children] BYE!

370
00:13:02,239 --> 00:13:03,698
- WE'RE DOING THIS FOR MICHAEL.

371
00:13:03,698 --> 00:13:05,993
- STOP HER, BUSTER. 
- WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO?

372
00:13:05,993 --> 00:13:07,702
- STOP HER! 
- STOP YELLING AT ME!

373
00:13:07,702 --> 00:13:08,871
- I'M LEAVING!

374
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:10,622
narrator: AND THAT'S 
WHEN BUSTER NOTICED

375
00:13:10,622 --> 00:13:11,832
THE SEAL ON RITA'S BACKPACK.

376
00:13:11,832 --> 00:13:15,002
- [screaming] 
- [screaming]

377
00:13:15,002 --> 00:13:16,795
[whimpering]

378
00:13:19,256 --> 00:13:21,133
- HEY, TALK ABOUT CATHARTIC.

379
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:22,467
NOW THAT'S AN ACT BREAK.

380
00:13:22,467 --> 00:13:23,677
[banjo]

381
00:13:27,848 --> 00:13:31,185
narrator: BUSTER HAD OVERCOME 
HIS FEAR OF SEALS.

382
00:13:31,185 --> 00:13:32,895
UNFORTUNATELY, HE'D DONE SO

383
00:13:32,895 --> 00:13:34,939
BY KNOCKING OUT 
MICHAEL'S NEW GIRLFRIEND.

384
00:13:34,939 --> 00:13:36,065
- WHAT THE HELL DID YOU DO?

385
00:13:36,065 --> 00:13:37,482
- YOU CURIOUS, MOM?

386
00:13:37,482 --> 00:13:38,442
I CAN SHOW YOU.

387
00:13:38,442 --> 00:13:40,360
- UH, YOU MADE A MISTAKE.

388
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:43,238
YOU'RE HUMAN. 
EXCEPT FOR THE HAND.

389
00:13:43,238 --> 00:13:46,700
- IT'S OKAY. SHE'S ALIVE. 
AND SOFT. SOFT AND ALIVE.

390
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:49,078
- ALL RIGHT, LET'S NOT 
ADD THAT TO THE CHARGES.

391
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:50,120
WHAT'LL WE DO?

392
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,371
SHE'S GONNA TELL MICHAEL.

393
00:13:51,371 --> 00:13:52,831
AND HE WON'T HEAR 
THE GOOD STUFF.

394
00:13:52,831 --> 00:13:55,167
HE'LL JUST HEAR 
ABOUT THE BEATING.

395
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:57,169
- WAIT. MAYBE WE CAN GIVE HER 
A "FORGET-ME-NOW."

396
00:13:57,169 --> 00:13:58,420
HERE YOU GO, HOT DOG.

397
00:13:58,420 --> 00:13:59,379
TAKE THE PILL.

398
00:13:59,379 --> 00:14:00,965
- WHAT'S A FORGET-ME-NOW?

399
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:02,007
- THEY'RE PILLS THAT CREATE

400
00:14:02,007 --> 00:14:03,467
A SORT OF TEMPORARY 
"FORGETTINESS."

401
00:14:03,467 --> 00:14:05,219
SO IF SOMEBODY FINDS OUT 
HOW YOU DO A TRICK,

402
00:14:05,219 --> 00:14:07,804
YOU JUST GIVE THEM ONE OF THESE, 
AND THEY FORGET THE WHOLE THING.

403
00:14:07,804 --> 00:14:09,514
IT'S A MAINSTAY 
OF THE MAGICIAN'S TOOL KIT.

404
00:14:09,514 --> 00:14:11,808
LIKE HOW CLOWNS ALWAYS HAVE 
A RAG SOAKED IN ETHER.

405
00:14:11,808 --> 00:14:14,853
- GOB, THIS IS FLUNITRAZIPAM. 
IT'S A ROOFIE.

406
00:14:14,853 --> 00:14:16,188
- THOSE ARE ILLEGAL!

407
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:17,231
- SHUT UP, MOM.

408
00:14:17,231 --> 00:14:18,941
DON'T MAKE ME GIVE YOU 
ANOTHER ONE OF THESE.

409
00:14:18,941 --> 00:14:21,026
- [gasps]

410
00:14:22,277 --> 00:14:24,113
- LINDSAY, HELP ME! 
THREE!

411
00:14:27,741 --> 00:14:30,285
narrator: BACK AT THE HOUSE, 
MICHAEL FINISHED HIS WORK

412
00:14:30,285 --> 00:14:32,329
AND NOW LATE, 
RUSHED TO PICK UP RITA.

413
00:14:32,329 --> 00:14:33,413
MOMENTS LATER,

414
00:14:33,413 --> 00:14:36,083
MAEBY PREPARED TO TELL STEVE 
SHE WASN'T READY FOR ROMANCE.

415
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:38,377
- WELL, THIS SENDS 
A MIXED MESSAGE.

416
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:40,045
narrator: JUST AS STEVE 
SHOWED UP

417
00:14:40,045 --> 00:14:42,089
TO CALL THINGS OFF 
WITH HIS COUSIN.

418
00:14:42,089 --> 00:14:45,009
- YOU DID ALL THIS FOR ME? 
- YES.

419
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:48,178
WELL, I'M GONNA 
GO GET SEXY.

420
00:14:51,015 --> 00:14:54,977
narrator: 
AND MICHAEL MISSED RITA.

421
00:14:54,977 --> 00:14:57,897
- DAMN IT. STRIKE TWO.

422
00:14:57,897 --> 00:14:58,939
[phone rings]

423
00:14:58,939 --> 00:14:59,940
- TAKE IT DOWN.

424
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:02,026
WE DON'T WANT ANYTHING 
IN THIS HOUSE THAT SAYS RITA.

425
00:15:02,026 --> 00:15:05,820
- HI. IT'S MICHAEL. 
I WILL BE COMING TO THE PARTY,

426
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:08,908
BECAUSE I LOVE YOU TOO.

427
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:11,493
- OKAY. WE NEED A NEW BANNER.

428
00:15:11,493 --> 00:15:13,578
narrator: AND THAT'S 
WHEN MICHAEL FOUND RITA.

429
00:15:13,578 --> 00:15:15,580
- RITA.

430
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:18,292
- WHY AM I ON A BUS BENCH, 
MICHAEL?

431
00:15:18,292 --> 00:15:19,418
- I GET IT. 
BECAUSE I'M LATE.

432
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:20,877
I'M SORRY. BUT THE REST 
OF THE NIGHT'S

433
00:15:20,877 --> 00:15:22,546
GONNA BE ALL ABOUT YOU, 
I PROMISE.

434
00:15:22,546 --> 00:15:24,214
GREAT. GREAT.

435
00:15:24,214 --> 00:15:26,383
I AM GONNA HAVE TO MAKE 
ONE QUICK STOP.

436
00:15:26,383 --> 00:15:27,467
MAYBE JUST WAIT 
IN THE CAR?

437
00:15:27,467 --> 00:15:29,261
IT'S JUST GONNA BE 
TWO SECONDS, I PROMISE.

438
00:15:29,261 --> 00:15:30,804
narrator: AND SO MICHAEL 
RACED UP

439
00:15:30,804 --> 00:15:32,222
TO PAY HIS QUICK RESPECTS 
TO BUSTER.

440
00:15:32,222 --> 00:15:35,017
- AH, THERE HE IS-- 
MY FAVORITE SON.

441
00:15:35,017 --> 00:15:36,268
- EVERYBODY'S 
FAVORITE SON!

442
00:15:36,268 --> 00:15:38,437
- MR. WONDERFUL! 
[growls]

443
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:40,897
- WELL, I HAD A GREAT TIME. 
I WISH I COULD'VE STAYED LONGER.

444
00:15:40,897 --> 00:15:42,149
THIS IS A GREAT PARTY, HUH?

445
00:15:42,149 --> 00:15:44,026
TELL BUSTER I STOPPED BY, 
PLEASE.

446
00:15:44,026 --> 00:15:44,944
I DO HAVE TO LEAVE.

447
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:46,153
- OH, NO, NO, NO.

448
00:15:46,153 --> 00:15:48,697
THE PARTY IS NOT 
FOR BUSTER ANYMORE.

449
00:15:48,697 --> 00:15:50,240
- NO, MICHAEL. 
IT'S FOR YOU.

450
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,408
- ME.

451
00:15:51,408 --> 00:15:53,493
- TAKE A LOOK 
AT BANNER, MICHAEL!

452
00:15:55,037 --> 00:15:58,790
- YOU GUYS DID ALL OF THIS 
FOR ME? "FAMILY LOVE--"

453
00:15:58,790 --> 00:15:59,791
- MICHAEL?

454
00:15:59,791 --> 00:16:01,376
narrator: 
EVERYONE FROZE.

455
00:16:01,376 --> 00:16:04,964
MICHAEL FEARED HE'D BEEN CAUGHT 
IN A LIE ABOUT HIS FAMILY.

456
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:07,132
HIS FAMILY FEARED 
THEY'D BEEN CAUGHT

457
00:16:07,132 --> 00:16:11,095
BY A WOMAN THEY CLUBBED, 
DRUGGED, AND LEFT ON A BENCH.

458
00:16:11,095 --> 00:16:13,097
IT WAS AWKWARD.

459
00:16:13,097 --> 00:16:13,930
- WHO'S THIS?

460
00:16:13,930 --> 00:16:15,975
- MOTHER! MOTHER!

461
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:17,059
THIS IS FROM THE ARMY.

462
00:16:17,059 --> 00:16:19,186
I HAVE TO REPORT 
FOR DUTY TOMORROW!

463
00:16:19,186 --> 00:16:22,022
IT SAYS BY ACCEPTING THIS 
MEDAL, I WAS REENLISTING.

464
00:16:22,022 --> 00:16:23,190
- I DIDN'T HEAR THEM 
SAY THAT.

465
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:25,484
narrator: PERHAPS IF THE 
SERGEANT HAD SPOKEN MORE SLOWLY,

466
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:26,026
SHE WOULD HAVE.

467
00:16:26,026 --> 00:16:27,569
- [slow motion] 
IN ACCEPTANCE OF THIS MEDAL,

468
00:16:27,569 --> 00:16:29,404
YOU PROUDLY WAIVE ALL RIGHTS 
TO PRIVATE CITIZENSHIP

469
00:16:29,404 --> 00:16:31,906
AND HEREBY REENLIST IN THE ARMED 
SERVICES OF THE UNITED STATES.

470
00:16:31,906 --> 00:16:33,367
IF YOU AGREE WITH THIS, 
SAY THANK YOU.

471
00:16:33,367 --> 00:16:36,661
- [very slow motion] 
THANK YOU.

472
00:16:36,661 --> 00:16:38,372
WHAT AM I GONNA DO? 
I CAN'T GO BACK THERE.

473
00:16:38,372 --> 00:16:39,414
I'VE NEVER BEEN!

474
00:16:39,414 --> 00:16:41,291
- WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE?

475
00:16:41,291 --> 00:16:43,252
- THIS IS MY FAMILY.

476
00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:45,795
- NO. NO. 
I DON'T LIKE THESE PEOPLE.

477
00:16:45,795 --> 00:16:47,214
- ME. YOU MEAN--SHE MEANS ME.

478
00:16:47,214 --> 00:16:50,134
BECAUSE I LIED 
ABOUT HAVING A FAMILY,

479
00:16:50,134 --> 00:16:52,344
BECAUSE I WAS EMBARRASSED 
BY THEM.

480
00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:54,804
AND I'M ASHAMED OF THAT.

481
00:16:54,804 --> 00:16:56,890
- I HAVE TO LEAVE.

482
00:16:59,643 --> 00:17:01,645
- STRIKE THREE.

483
00:17:01,645 --> 00:17:04,814
- YOU SAID YOU DIDN'T 
HAVE A FAMILY?

484
00:17:04,814 --> 00:17:06,941
- EVERYBODY'S 
FAVORITE SON.

485
00:17:06,941 --> 00:17:08,110
- MR. TERRIBLE.

486
00:17:10,654 --> 00:17:12,656
- AND HER? 
TOO GOOD FOR US? HUH.

487
00:17:12,656 --> 00:17:14,866
BUSTER, YOU SHOULD'VE 
FINISHED THE JOB.

488
00:17:14,866 --> 00:17:15,950
- JOB? WHAT JOB?

489
00:17:15,950 --> 00:17:18,328
- DID I SAY JOB? I MEANT GOB.

490
00:17:18,328 --> 00:17:21,706
- BUSTER'S THE ONE THAT HIT HER. 
I JUST GAVE HER THE ROOFIE.

491
00:17:21,706 --> 00:17:23,583
- ROOFIE? 
- FORGET-ME-NOW.

492
00:17:23,583 --> 00:17:25,585
- YOU BEAT AND DRUGGED RITA?

493
00:17:28,422 --> 00:17:29,589
- TAKE THIS 
AND LOVE US AGAIN.

494
00:17:29,589 --> 00:17:30,174
- NO, NO, NO!

495
00:17:30,174 --> 00:17:32,342
- NO, JUST TAKE IT! 
- NO, GOB!

496
00:17:32,342 --> 00:17:34,969
UM, I'M LEAVING TOO.

497
00:17:36,263 --> 00:17:40,434
- WELL, NO GOOD DEED 
GOES UNPUNISHED.

498
00:17:40,434 --> 00:17:42,186
- OH, LOOK,

TO FIND 
AN UNCONSCIOUS STEVE HOLT.

512
00:18:21,725 --> 00:18:23,143

HOW IS THAT EVEN POSSIBLE?

520
00:18:35,697 --> 00:18:37,491
- NO, GEORGE MICHAEL. 
WE DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.

521
00:18:37,491 --> 00:18:40,160
I JUST WANTED HIM TO THINK 
WE DID. DON'T YOU SEE?

00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,828
I DRUGGED HIM NOT TO GO 
ALL THE WAY WITH HIM.

THING YOU SAY ON PAGE SEVEN

540
00:19:14,110 --> 00:19:16,363
LOOKS LIKE 
IT COULD BE WORTH SOME MONEY.

541
00:19:19,741 --> 00:19:20,784
- SPEAKING TO ME YET?

542
00:19:20,784 --> 00:19:22,202

WHAT WERE YOU GUYS DOING 
WITH RITA IN THE FIRST PLACE?

I WAS TRYING TO IMPRESS HER.

00:19:35,965 --> 00:19:38,427
LET'S FACE IT. 
SHE'S PROBABLY TOO GOOD FOR ME.

550
00:19:38,427 --> 00:19:40,762
- NO. WHAT YOU NEED TO DO 
IS GO TO HER

551
00:19:40,762 --> 00:19:42,347
AND ASK 
FOR ANOTHER CHANCE.

552
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:45,016
SHE'D BE LUCKY 
TO HAVE YOU, MICHAEL.
