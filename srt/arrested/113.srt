00:00:01,126 --> 00:00:03,002
male narrator: NOW THE STORY 
OF A WEALTHY FAMILY

2
00:00:03,002 --> 00:00:04,045
WHO LOST EVERYTHING

3
00:00:04,045 --> 00:00:06,214
AND THE ONE SON 
WHO HAD NO CHOICE

4
00:00:06,214 --> 00:00:09,217
BUT TO KEEP THEM ALL TOGETHER.

5
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:16,682
IT'S "ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT."

6
00:00:18,434 --> 00:00:20,311
narrator: 
MICHAEL BLUTH WAS INFATUATED

7
00:00:20,311 --> 00:00:22,438
WITH HIS BROTHER'S 
GIRLFRIEND, MARTA,

8
00:00:22,438 --> 00:00:24,857
A SPANISH-LANGUAGE 
SOAP OPERA STAR.

9
00:00:24,857 --> 00:00:26,942
BUT WHEN HE FOUND OUT 
SHE WAS INTERESTED

10
00:00:26,942 --> 00:00:30,280
IN A MAN NAMED HERMANO, 
HE CONFRONTED HER.

11
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:32,282
UNFORTUNATELY, 
HE DISCOVERED TOO LATE

12
00:00:32,282 --> 00:00:35,535
THAT "HERMANO" 
IN SPANISH MEANT "BROTHER,"

13
00:00:35,535 --> 00:00:37,703
AND THE PERSON MARTA 
WAS INFATUATED WITH

14
00:00:37,703 --> 00:00:40,373
WAS, IN FACT, HIMSELF.

15
00:00:40,373 --> 00:00:43,293
THIS WAS DISTRACTING MICHAEL 
THE NEXT DAY WHEN HE WENT

16
00:00:43,293 --> 00:00:45,628
TO MEET HIS FATHER'S 
ATTORNEY AT PRISON.

17
00:00:45,628 --> 00:00:48,548
- LOOK, THERE IS NOTHING TO IT. 
IT'S AN ARRAIGNMENT.

18
00:00:48,548 --> 00:00:49,924
THEY ANNOUNCE THE CHARGES.

19
00:00:49,924 --> 00:00:53,136
HOWEVER, IT WOULD HELP 
IF YOU ALL SHOWED UP,

20
00:00:53,136 --> 00:00:55,721
LOOKING LIKE A LOVING, 
SUPPORTIVE FAMILY.

21
00:00:55,721 --> 00:00:58,599
- FOR HOW LONG? 
- TEN MINUTES, TOPS.

22
00:00:58,599 --> 00:01:01,018
- SEE IF YOU CAN 
GET IT DOWN TO FIVE.

23
00:01:01,018 --> 00:01:03,188
- YOU KNOW, MAYBE I SHOULD 
CONFESS THESE CRIMES,

24
00:01:03,188 --> 00:01:04,480
SAVE EVERYBODY THE TROUBLE.

25
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:06,023
- OH, GET OFF THE MOUNT.

26
00:01:06,023 --> 00:01:09,110
YOU'RE COMING HOME, GUILTY 
OR SOMEHOW FOUND NOT GUILTY.

27
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:10,820
[phone ringing]

28
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:11,821
- HELLO?

29
00:01:11,821 --> 00:01:13,073
- WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON?

30
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:15,866
I'M WAITING TO HEAR ABOUT 
MARTA AND THIS HERMANO GUY.

31
00:01:15,866 --> 00:01:16,867
- YEAH, I CHECKED IT OUT.

32
00:01:16,867 --> 00:01:18,453
I DO NOT THINK 
THAT SHE'S CHEATING.

33
00:01:18,453 --> 00:01:19,537
- I'M GOING OVER TO MARTA'S.

34
00:01:19,537 --> 00:01:21,372
- NO, NO, NO. 
DON'T--DON'T DO THAT, OKAY?

35
00:01:21,372 --> 00:01:23,583
JUST LAY LOW, BE COOL, 
AND I'LL TALK TO HER AGAIN.

36
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:26,085
THAT WAY YOU DON'T LOOK 
SO DESPERATE, YOU KNOW?

37
00:01:26,085 --> 00:01:27,670
- YOU'RE A GOOD GUY, MON FRERE.

38
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:29,589
THAT MEANS "BROTHER" IN FRENCH.

39
00:01:29,589 --> 00:01:33,968
I DON'T KNOW WHY I KNOW THAT. 
I TOOK FOUR YEARS OF SPANISH.

40
00:01:33,968 --> 00:01:35,845
narrator: SO MICHAEL 
WENT TO SPEAK WITH MARTA

41
00:01:35,845 --> 00:01:38,639
ABOUT THE MISUNDERSTANDING 
FROM THE NIGHT BEFORE.

42
00:01:38,639 --> 00:01:41,559
- I OWE YOU AN APOLOGY. 
- NO, I OWE YOU AN APOLOGY.

43
00:01:41,559 --> 00:01:44,270
I'M SO ASHAMED THAT 
I WAS SO DISRESPECTFUL

44
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:45,271
TO YOUR BROTHER.

45
00:01:45,271 --> 00:01:46,939
- OH, WHO CARES? 
NOBODY RESPECTS HIM.

46
00:01:46,939 --> 00:01:49,359
YOU SEE, MARTA, 
I HAVE BEEN INTERESTED IN YOU

47
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:51,902
SINCE THE FIRST DAY THAT WE MET.

48
00:01:51,902 --> 00:01:55,531
- REALLY? 
- YEAH, YEAH.

49
00:01:55,531 --> 00:01:57,242
- IT DOESN'T MATTER.

50
00:01:57,242 --> 00:02:01,078
WE LIVE BY A CODE, 
YOU AND I--TO HONOR FAMILY.

51
00:02:01,078 --> 00:02:03,789
- YES, THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS 
THAT ATTRACTED ME TO YOU--

52
00:02:03,789 --> 00:02:06,126
YOUR SENSE OF RIGHT AND WRONG.

53
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:08,169
I ALSO LIKE YOUR HAIR 
AND YOUR FACE AND YOUR BREASTS.

54
00:02:08,169 --> 00:02:09,754
- YOU'RE SO UNLIKE 
YOUR BROTHER.

55
00:02:09,754 --> 00:02:10,755
- OH, THANK YOU.

56
00:02:10,755 --> 00:02:14,091
- GOB IS LIKE THE COCK 
OF THE WALK, BUT NOT YOU.

57
00:02:14,091 --> 00:02:15,218
- YOU'RE SO KIND.

58
00:02:15,218 --> 00:02:16,719
- YOU'RE SENSITIVE, 
LIKE A WOMAN.

59
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:18,721
- THAT'S ENOUGH.

60
00:02:18,721 --> 00:02:20,223
WE DO HAVE TO DO 
THE RIGHT THING.

61
00:02:20,223 --> 00:02:22,767
- AND BEING TOGETHER 
IS THE WRONG THING.

62
00:02:22,767 --> 00:02:26,812
- VERY, VERY...

63
00:02:26,812 --> 00:02:28,481
WRONG.

64
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:40,285
- [singing] AND IT'S THERE 
WHEN YOU CALL OUT MY NAME

65
00:02:40,285 --> 00:02:43,538
TWO, ONE, TWO, 
THREE, FOUR

66
00:02:43,538 --> 00:02:47,708
FIVE, SIX, SEVEN, EIGHT 
LOVE, NINE, TEN, TWELVE

67
00:02:47,708 --> 00:02:49,001
- IS THAT GOB?

68
00:02:49,001 --> 00:02:51,003
- HE LIKES 
TO MAKE LOVE TO THIS.

69
00:02:51,003 --> 00:02:55,883
- I'M GONNA TURN THIS OFF. 
- PLEASE.

70
00:02:55,883 --> 00:02:58,553
- OH!

71
00:02:58,553 --> 00:02:59,970
- GOB'S WAND.

72
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:02,432
- OH, THIS-- 
THIS IS SO WRONG.

73
00:03:02,432 --> 00:03:03,683
- YES. 
- NO, NO, NO.

74
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:06,519
- NOT--NOT--NOT-- 
NOT HOT WRONG.

75
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:09,814
YOU KNOW, REGULAR WRONG. 
I GOT TO TELL GOB.

76
00:03:09,814 --> 00:03:11,816
- NO, I HAVE TO TELL HIM.

77
00:03:11,816 --> 00:03:13,818
- YES, BUT--BUT YOU SPEAK 
A LITTLE SLOWLY,

78
00:03:13,818 --> 00:03:15,361
AND I REALLY WANT 
TO GET THIS THING MOVING ALONG.

79
00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:16,987
SO, LISTEN, 
YOU DO THE NOBLE THING,

80
00:03:16,987 --> 00:03:18,698
AND YOU TELL HIM 
THAT YOU'VE MET SOMEBODY ELSE.

81
00:03:18,698 --> 00:03:20,741
I'M GONNA DO THE NOBLE THING 
AND TELL HIM THAT IT'S ME.

82
00:03:20,741 --> 00:03:22,410
WHILE I'M DOING MY NOBLE THING,

83
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:25,580
YOU COULD PUT THOSE PHOTOS 
IN A BOX, GET RID OF THE WAND,

84
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:28,666
AND WE CAN DO THE WRONG THING 
THE RIGHT WAY.

85
00:03:28,666 --> 00:03:30,167
narrator: 
AND MAEBY WAS GETTING TIRED

86
00:03:30,167 --> 00:03:31,711
OF HER PARENTS' 
CONSTANT FIGHTING.

87
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:33,713
- I'M SAYING EVERY 
TIME SOMETHING STARTS

88
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:35,089
TO GO WELL FOR YOU, 
YOU BLOW IT.

89
00:03:35,089 --> 00:03:37,550
- NOTHING HAS EVER GONE WELL 
FOR ME, AND YOU KNOW THAT!

90
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:41,387
- THAT'S MY POINT, 
YOU HANDSOME COWBOY, YOU.

91
00:03:41,387 --> 00:03:43,013
- OH, GREAT, 
AND NOW YOU'RE MOCKING ME,

92
00:03:43,013 --> 00:03:47,268
YOU SELFISH, 
COUNTRY-MUSIC-LOVING LADY.

93
00:03:47,268 --> 00:03:48,644
HELLO, MAEBY.

94
00:03:48,644 --> 00:03:49,895
- NICE COVER.

95
00:03:49,895 --> 00:03:51,146
WHY DON'T YOU TWO 
JUST GET A DIVORCE

96
00:03:51,146 --> 00:03:52,690
AND SAVE US ALL 
A LOT OF GRIEF?

97
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:54,567
narrator: THE NIGHT BEFORE, 
TOBIAS AND LINDSAY

98
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:57,111
HAD CHOSEN 
TO SLEEP IN SEPARATE ROOMS,

99
00:03:57,111 --> 00:04:00,323
AND TOBIAS HAD DROPPED AN 
INTRIGUING BIT OF INFORMATION.

100
00:04:00,323 --> 00:04:01,782
- AND THEN, OF COURSE, 
WE COULDN'T CONCEIVE,

101
00:04:01,782 --> 00:04:03,743
SO THERE WAS THAT FAMOUS ORDEAL.

102
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:05,077
- WHAT--WHAT DO YOU MEAN, 
YOU COULDN'T CONCEIVE?

103
00:04:05,077 --> 00:04:06,078
[phone ringing]

104
00:04:06,078 --> 00:04:07,079
WAS MAEBY ADOPTED?

105
00:04:07,079 --> 00:04:08,664
IS SHE NOT REALLY RELATED TO ME? 
IS SHE JUST SOME GIRL I KNOW?

106
00:04:08,664 --> 00:04:10,416
narrator: GEORGE MICHAEL 
NEVER GOT AN ANSWER.

107
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:12,460
- [whispering] 
IT'S CARL WEATHERS.

108
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:15,255
narrator: SO HE SET ABOUT DOING 
SOME INVESTIGATING ON HIS OWN.

109
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:17,673
- HEY, HAVE YOU EVER SEEN ANY 
PICTURES OF YOUR MOM PREGNANT?

110
00:04:17,673 --> 00:04:18,966
- DON'T TALK TO ME ABOUT MY MOM.

111
00:04:18,966 --> 00:04:21,051
SHE'S CRAZY. 
BOTH OF THEM ARE.

112
00:04:21,051 --> 00:04:23,012
SOMETIMES I WISH 
WE WEREN'T EVEN RELATED.

113
00:04:23,012 --> 00:04:24,305
- HEY, YOU KNOW, 
MAYBE WE'RE NOT.

114
00:04:24,305 --> 00:04:25,306
BECAUSE, I MEAN, 
WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT,

115
00:04:25,306 --> 00:04:27,850
WE DON'T EVEN REALLY 
LOOK LIKE EACH OTHER.

116
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:30,270
- NO, I WAS TALKING 
ABOUT MY PARENTS.

117
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:33,314
GOD, WHAT'S WRONG 
WITH THIS FAMILY?

118
00:04:33,314 --> 00:04:36,025
- MAYBE WE'RE NOT A FAMILY.

119
00:04:36,025 --> 00:04:38,736
AND MAYBE THAT'S 
VERY, VERY RIGHT.

120
00:04:38,736 --> 00:04:41,906
WE-- 
UNCLE GOB.

121
00:04:41,906 --> 00:04:44,199
HEY, UH, WAS AUNT LINDSAY 
EVER PREGNANT?

122
00:04:44,199 --> 00:04:48,203
- OH, YEAH, DOZENS OF TIMES. 
HEY, IS YOUR DAD AROUND, OR--

123
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:54,710
- HEY, GOB. 
MARTA CALL?

124
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:57,087
- SHE SURE HAS--

125
00:04:57,087 --> 00:04:59,089
FOUR TIMES, 
BUT I DIDN'T TAKE THE CALLS.

126
00:04:59,089 --> 00:05:00,841
- OH, NO? 
WHY NOT?

127
00:05:00,841 --> 00:05:02,009
- BECAUSE OF YOU.

128
00:05:02,009 --> 00:05:04,554
YOU SAID TO LAY LOW. 
AND IT'S WORKING.

129
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:05,555
- GREAT.

130
00:05:05,555 --> 00:05:07,181
- TELL YOU WHAT, 
YOU MAY NOT BE GOOD WITH WOMEN,

131
00:05:07,181 --> 00:05:09,266
BUT YOU ARE GREAT 
WITH OTHER PEOPLE'S WOMEN.

132
00:05:09,266 --> 00:05:10,726
I'LL GIVE YOU THAT.

133
00:05:10,726 --> 00:05:12,603
- LISTEN, GOB, 
YOU CAN'T JUST IGNORE HER.

134
00:05:12,603 --> 00:05:15,022
MAYBE YOU SHOULD TALK TO HER. 
SHE IS YOUR GIRLFRIEND.

135
00:05:15,022 --> 00:05:18,318
- EXACTLY. 
AND I WANT TO KEEP IT THAT WAY.

136
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:20,361
FOR ALL I KNOW, SHE'S CALLING 
TO BREAK UP WITH ME.

137
00:05:20,361 --> 00:05:22,447
I DON'T ANSWER THE PHONE, 
THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN.

138
00:05:22,447 --> 00:05:24,699
AND IT'S ALL BECAUSE 
OF YOU, FRATELLO.

139
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:27,327
IT'S ITALIAN FOR BROTHER, SO...

140
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:30,120
NOW ALL I GOTTA DO 
IS FIND THIS HERMANO GUY.

141
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,456
I'M GONNA KILL HIM.

142
00:05:31,456 --> 00:05:32,998
- HEY, BROTHER. 
- HEY, BUSTY.

143
00:05:32,998 --> 00:05:34,584
- OH, HEY, BROTHER. 
- HEY, BUSTER.

144
00:05:34,584 --> 00:05:36,961
- GOB, THERE'S NO NEED 
FOR VIOLENCE--THERE NEVER IS.

145
00:05:36,961 --> 00:05:38,879
I LIKE TO THINK THAT WE'RE ALL, 
YOU KNOW, INTELLIGENT,

146
00:05:38,879 --> 00:05:41,716
MATURE, UM--

147
00:05:41,716 --> 00:05:43,801
ADULTS THAT--THAT 
CAN SETTLE THEIR DIFFERENCES,

148
00:05:43,801 --> 00:05:45,886
WHENEVER THEY MIGHT COME 
TO LIGHT, THROUGH WORDS.

149
00:05:45,886 --> 00:05:49,056
- YEAH, WELL, I LET MY FISTS 
DO THE TALKING.

150
00:05:49,056 --> 00:05:50,307
NOT THIS ONE, 
'CAUSE OBVIOUSLY,

151
00:05:50,307 --> 00:05:51,892
I NEED IT 
FOR COIN TRICKS AND STUFF.

152
00:05:51,892 --> 00:05:54,061
BUT THIS ONE, I LET IT 
SPEAK FOR BOTH OF THEM.

153
00:05:54,061 --> 00:05:55,062
- WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

154
00:05:55,062 --> 00:05:56,355
MOM ALWAYS TAUGHT US 
TO CURL UP IN A BALL

155
00:05:56,355 --> 00:05:58,816
AND REMAIN MOTIONLESS 
WHEN CONFRONTED.

156
00:05:58,816 --> 00:06:01,318
THAT'S WHAT I DID IN HIGH SCHOOL 
WHEN I ALMOST GOT INTO A FIGHT.

157
00:06:01,318 --> 00:06:03,529
- I THINK THAT WAS ABOUT 
BEING ATTACKED BY BEARS.

158
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:06,115
- YEAH, I KNOW.

159
00:06:06,115 --> 00:06:11,787
- HEY, RICH KID. 
GIVE ME YOUR LUNCH MONEY.

160
00:06:11,787 --> 00:06:13,205
- BUT SOMETIMES I WONDER 
WHAT IT WOULD BE LIKE

161
00:06:13,205 --> 00:06:15,458
TO GET INTO A FIGHT TODAY.

162
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:16,459
- WELL, YOU'D BE 
A MUCH BIGGER BALL.

163
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:17,543
- I MEAN, 
THERE IS SO MUCH IN LIFE

164
00:06:17,543 --> 00:06:19,420
THAT I HAVE NOT EXPERIENCED.

165
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:20,505
AND NOW THAT I'M AWAY FROM MOM,

166
00:06:20,505 --> 00:06:23,048
I FEEL LIKE THIS IS 
MY CHANCE TO LIVE.

167
00:06:23,048 --> 00:06:25,843
I WANT TO DANCE. 
I WANT TO MAKE LOVE TO A WOMAN.

168
00:06:25,843 --> 00:06:27,887
I WANT TO GET 
A CHECKING ACCOUNT.

169
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:30,097
I WANT TO KNOW WHAT IT FEELS 
LIKE TO GET MY FACE SOCKED IN.

170
00:06:30,097 --> 00:06:31,306
[phone rings]

171
00:06:31,306 --> 00:06:32,808
- MICHAEL, DON'T GET THAT! 
THAT COULD BE MARTA!

172
00:06:32,808 --> 00:06:34,894
- WHAT? 
OOP.

173
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:36,270
TOO LATE. 
HELLO?

174
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:37,647
- MICHAEL? 
- OH, HI, MOM.

175
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:38,689
- I'M NOT HERE.

176
00:06:38,689 --> 00:06:42,234
- IS THAT BUSTER? 
TELL HIM I'M FINE WITHOUT HIM.

177
00:06:42,234 --> 00:06:43,569
WHY HAVEN'T YOU CALLED ME BACK?

178
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:45,446
I'M WORRIED ABOUT 
YOUR FATHER'S HEARING.

179
00:06:45,446 --> 00:06:46,572
- MOM, LISTEN, 
IT'S GONNA BE FINE.

180
00:06:46,572 --> 00:06:48,073
I'M ON IT, OKAY? 
I'M TAKING CARE OF IT.

181
00:06:48,073 --> 00:06:49,659
I'LL BE THERE 
FIRST THING FRIDAY MORNING.

182
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:52,036
- IT'S TOMORROW AT 4:30.

183
00:06:52,036 --> 00:06:55,998
- OH, I SHOULD WRITE THAT DOWN. 
- WHERE IS YOUR HEAD, MICHAEL?

184
00:06:55,998 --> 00:06:56,999
- LISTEN, 
EVERYTHING'S GONNA BE FINE.

185
00:06:56,999 --> 00:06:58,125
THEY JUST READ THE CHARGES,

186
00:06:58,125 --> 00:07:00,670
AND WE LOOK LIKE A LOVING FAMILY 
FOR, LIKE, SIX MINUTES.

187
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:02,046
- TEN MINUTES.

188
00:07:02,046 --> 00:07:03,798
- WE COULDN'T 
GET THAT DOWN, HUH?

189
00:07:03,798 --> 00:07:04,924
narrator: 
GEORGE MICHAEL, MEANWHILE,

190
00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:06,842
WENT TO SPEAK WITH TOBIAS.

191
00:07:06,842 --> 00:07:08,177
- THIS WAS JUST FAXED TO YOU.

192
00:07:08,177 --> 00:07:09,887
- OH, GREAT! 
THE REWRITE.

193
00:07:09,887 --> 00:07:12,765
LET'S SEE IF THEY'VE 
BEEFED UP MY PART.

194
00:07:12,765 --> 00:07:14,517
I GOT THREE LINES!

195
00:07:14,517 --> 00:07:16,936
- SO, UH, I'VE BEEN THINKING 
ABOUT THAT, UH--

196
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:18,604
THAT CONVERSATION 
WE WERE HAVING THE OTHER NIGHT

197
00:07:18,604 --> 00:07:20,981
ABOUT, UH, WHERE MAEBY 
CAME FROM, AND, UH,

198
00:07:20,981 --> 00:07:24,485
I WAS JUST WONDERING IF 
YOU COULD FINISH THAT THOUGHT.

199
00:07:24,485 --> 00:07:28,448
- YES, OKAY. 
UH, WELL, HAVE A SEAT.

200
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:31,451
UH...

201
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:35,037
UM...

202
00:07:35,037 --> 00:07:37,665
WHEN A MAN

203
00:07:37,665 --> 00:07:41,669
NEEDS TO PROVE TO A WOMAN 
THAT HE'S ACTUALLY--

204
00:07:43,295 --> 00:07:45,465
WHEN A MAN LOVES A WOMAN

205
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:50,135
AND HE ACTUALLY WANTS 
TO MAKE LOVE, UH, TO HER,

206
00:07:50,135 --> 00:07:52,387
SOMETHING VERY, 
VERY SPECIAL HAPPENS.

207
00:07:52,387 --> 00:07:56,726
AND, UH, WITH DEEP, DEEP 
CONCENTRATION,

208
00:07:56,726 --> 00:08:00,813
AND--AND GREAT FOCUS, HE'S OFTEN 
ABLE TO ACHIEVE AN EREC--

209
00:08:00,813 --> 00:08:02,397
- I'M SORRY. 
I'M GONNA STOP YOU.

210
00:08:02,397 --> 00:08:03,649
I KNOW WHERE YOU'RE, UH...

211
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:06,068
I-I DIDN'T MEAN 
BABIES IN GENERAL.

212
00:08:06,068 --> 00:08:08,195
- OH, WELL, THAT'S GOOD,

213
00:08:08,195 --> 00:08:11,866
'CAUSE IT WAS ABOUT 
TO GET A LITTLE, UGH, GROSS.

214
00:08:11,866 --> 00:08:14,159
- YEAH, NO, I MEANT 
SPECIFICALLY WITH MAEBY.

215
00:08:14,159 --> 00:08:16,621
- WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA. 
THIS ISN'T RIGHT.

216
00:08:16,621 --> 00:08:17,955
- I KNOW, YOU'RE RIGHT. 
I'M SORRY.

217
00:08:17,955 --> 00:08:19,874
- NO, NO. 
IT SAYS IT'S A SHOWER SCENE.

218
00:08:19,874 --> 00:08:22,126
I'M NOT SUPPOSED 
TO BE IN A SHOWER SCENE.

219
00:08:22,126 --> 00:08:23,460
IT HAS NUDITY.

220
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:25,505
narrator: 
TOBIAS WAS A NEVER-NUDE,

221
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:27,507
WHICH IS 
EXACTLY WHAT IT SOUNDS LIKE.

222
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:31,051
- I DON'T DO NUDITY. 
IT SAYS THAT RIGHT ON MY RESUME.

223
00:08:31,051 --> 00:08:34,221
OKAY, WHAT DO YOU THINK 
I WEAR THESE FOR?

224
00:08:34,221 --> 00:08:36,682
- I WAS NEVER ACTUALLY 
CLEAR ON THAT.

225
00:08:36,682 --> 00:08:39,810
- SO, YOU'RE, UH-- 
YOU'RE NOT WITH MARTA ANYMORE?

226
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:42,897
- WELL, MY PLAN IS TO 
GET HER WANTING ME BUT BAD,

227
00:08:42,897 --> 00:08:44,356
AND THEN I SPRING IT ON HER.

228
00:08:44,356 --> 00:08:46,025
I KNOW YOU'VE 
BEEN CHEATING ON ME,

229
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:48,027
AND YOU JUST 
COST YOURSELF ONE FINE MAN

230
00:08:48,027 --> 00:08:50,780
AND ONE FINE CD OF HIM SINGING 
"LOVE IS IN THE AIR."

231
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:52,990
- WELL, I WOULD NEVER, UH,

232
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:56,076
DO THIS WHILE YOU WERE 
STILL GOING OUT, BUT, UH,

233
00:08:56,076 --> 00:08:59,539
IF YOU'RE DONE WITH HER, 
I'D SURE LIKE A CRACK AT HER.

234
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:01,957
- [chuckling] RIGHT, RIGHT. 
THAT SOUNDS GREAT.

235
00:09:01,957 --> 00:09:03,543
GO FOR IT, BUDDY.

236
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:05,836
BUT YOU KNOW THAT SHE'S KIND OF 
USED TO BEING WITH ME, RIGHT?

237
00:09:05,836 --> 00:09:09,882
SO, IT'D BE SORT OF LIKE 
GOING FROM PRIME RIB TO--

238
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:13,969
I DON'T KNOW-- 
WEIRD BROTHER OF PRIME RIB.

239
00:09:13,969 --> 00:09:15,054
DO YOU EVEN KNOW HER?

240
00:09:15,054 --> 00:09:16,722
- I MET HER. 
I FELL FOR HER.

241
00:09:16,722 --> 00:09:20,893
I'VE BEEN WATCHING HER PROGRAM, 
"EL AMOR PROHIBIDO,"

242
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:22,311
THE LOVE THAT IS FORBIDDEN.

243
00:09:22,311 --> 00:09:24,647
SHE IS THE LOVE 
THAT'S FORBIDDEN.

244
00:09:24,647 --> 00:09:27,066
THE LOVE OF MY HERMANO.

245
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:28,483
- WAIT A SECOND. 
WHAT?

246
00:09:28,483 --> 00:09:29,902
YOU KNOW HERMANO?

247
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:32,362
- "HERMANO" IS "BROTHER" 
IN SPANISH.

248
00:09:32,362 --> 00:09:36,325
AS IN, "HEY, HERMANO."

249
00:09:36,325 --> 00:09:37,743
- BROTHER?

250
00:09:37,743 --> 00:09:40,621
HERMANO MEANS BROTHER? 
- YEAH.

251
00:09:40,621 --> 00:09:45,500
- WELL, SOUNDS LIKE HERMANO 
IS ABOUT TO GET HIS ASS KICKED.

252
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:48,212
- WELL, THIS IS WHAT 
I SAID I WANTED.

253
00:09:48,212 --> 00:09:52,007
SO, ALL RIGHT. 
LET'S GET IT OVER WITH.

254
00:09:52,007 --> 00:09:54,009
[giggles, clears throat]

255
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:01,266
UH, SO, 
ARE YOU GONNA HIT ME?

256
00:10:01,266 --> 00:10:02,768
- NO, I'M NOT GONNA HIT YOU.

257
00:10:02,768 --> 00:10:05,354
YOU'RE NOT THE BROTHER 
MARTA'S CHEATING ON ME WITH.

258
00:10:05,354 --> 00:10:07,481
- OH. 
OH, WHO IS?

259
00:10:07,481 --> 00:10:09,441
- HOW THE HELL 
SHOULD I KNOW, BUSTER?

260
00:10:09,441 --> 00:10:11,193
- YOU KNOW, THERE IS A GUY

261
00:10:11,193 --> 00:10:14,071
WHO PLAYS HER OLDER BROTHER 
ON HER SHOW.

262
00:10:14,071 --> 00:10:15,572
I THINK HIS NAME IS TIO.

263
00:10:15,572 --> 00:10:17,491
- TIO.

264
00:10:17,491 --> 00:10:21,662
WELL, SOUNDS LIKE SOMEONE 
WHO YOU THINK'S NAME IS TIO

265
00:10:21,662 --> 00:10:24,206
IS ABOUT TO GET 
HIS ASS KICKED.

266
00:10:24,206 --> 00:10:27,710
THANKS FOR THE TIP, BUSTER.

267
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:29,336
- ALL RIGHT, MOM, 
I'LL BE SURE TO TELL BUSTER.

268
00:10:29,336 --> 00:10:31,421
RIGHT. 
BYE.

269
00:10:31,421 --> 00:10:32,673
MOM WANTED ME TO TELL YOU 
THAT SHE DOESN'T CARE

270
00:10:32,673 --> 00:10:34,383
WHETHER YOU LIVE OR DIE, 
BUT IF YOU'RE NOT DEAD,

271
00:10:34,383 --> 00:10:35,635
SHE WOULD LIKE TO SEE YOU 
AT THE COURTHOUSE TOMORROW

272
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:36,719
IN THE BLUE SWEATER.

273
00:10:36,719 --> 00:10:38,387
- DAMN IT! 
I HATE THE BLUE SWEATER.

274
00:10:38,387 --> 00:10:39,930
- SHE SAID IT WOULD LOOK NICE 
WITH THE GRAY PANTS.

275
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:41,473
- DAMN IT! 
SHE'S RIGHT!

276
00:10:41,473 --> 00:10:42,516
- WHERE'S GOB?

277
00:10:42,516 --> 00:10:44,727
- I THINK HE'S HEADING DOWN TO 
THE SET OF MARTA'S SOAP OPERA.

278
00:10:44,727 --> 00:10:45,728
- WHAT?

279
00:10:45,728 --> 00:10:47,647
- GET THIS: 
SHE MAY BE CHEATING ON HIM

280
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:49,815
WITH THE GUY 
WHO PLAYS HER BROTHER.

281
00:10:49,815 --> 00:10:50,816
I MEAN, I STILL LIKE HER,

282
00:10:50,816 --> 00:10:52,109
BUT WE'RE GONNA HAVE 
TO DEAL WITH THIS.

283
00:10:52,109 --> 00:10:53,653
- I GOTTA GO STOP HIM.

284
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:55,112
- AND I'VE GOT 
A BLUE SWEATER TO STEAM.

285
00:10:55,112 --> 00:10:57,072
- GOOD LUCK. 
- THANKS.

286
00:10:57,072 --> 00:10:59,241
narrator: 
GOB RACED TO CONFRONT TIO,

287
00:10:59,241 --> 00:11:02,161
WITH MICHAEL IN HOT PURSUIT.

288
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:07,207
GEORGE MICHAEL, HAVING FAILED

289
00:11:07,207 --> 00:11:09,794
TO GET THE INFORMATION 
HE NEEDED FROM ANYONE ELSE,

290
00:11:09,794 --> 00:11:11,586
MADE THE ULTIMATE SACRIFICE

291
00:11:11,586 --> 00:11:13,672
AND WENT TO THE KEEPER 
OF THE FAMILY SECRETS.

292
00:11:13,672 --> 00:11:17,968
- SO, UH, IT'S ABOUT MAEBY. 
- OH, THAT'S A LOST CAUSE.

293
00:11:17,968 --> 00:11:19,303
BUT YOU GET 
WHAT YOU PAY FOR, HUH?

294
00:11:19,303 --> 00:11:21,221
- YEAH.

295
00:11:21,221 --> 00:11:23,182
WAIT, WHAT--WHAT-- 
WHAT DO YOU MEAN, "PAY"?

296
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:27,436
- FERTILITY TESTS, LAB FEES, 
DONORS, AND IMPLANTS.

297
00:11:27,436 --> 00:11:30,397
SHE'S NOT REAL. 
SHE WAS MADE IN A CUP.

298
00:11:30,397 --> 00:11:35,152
LIKE SOUP-- 
A $130,000 CUP OF SOUP.

299
00:11:35,152 --> 00:11:38,072
HOW DO YOU LIKE THEM 
EGG ROLLS, MR. GOLDSTONE?

300
00:11:38,072 --> 00:11:39,824
ALL I KNOW IS 
IT TOOK AN EXTRA YEAR

301
00:11:39,824 --> 00:11:41,366
BEFORE WE COULD ADD A DEN.

302
00:11:41,366 --> 00:11:43,243
- SO ARE YOU SAYING WE'RE 
NOT DIRECTLY RELATED?

303
00:11:43,243 --> 00:11:48,623
- I'M SAYING SHE ALREADY SPENT 
HER INHERITANCE GETTING HERE.

304
00:11:48,623 --> 00:11:50,625
narrator: GOB, MEANWHILE, 
HAD FINALLY SHOWN UP

305
00:11:50,625 --> 00:11:52,544
AT THE "EL AMOR PROHIBIDO" SET.

306
00:11:52,544 --> 00:11:55,672
- [speaking Spanish]

307
00:11:55,672 --> 00:11:57,466
- HEY, GUY.

308
00:11:57,466 --> 00:12:00,135
THEY TELL ME YOU'RE THE ACTOR 
WHO PLAYS MARTA'S BROTHER, TIO.

309
00:12:00,135 --> 00:12:01,136
- COMO?

310
00:12:01,136 --> 00:12:04,181
- OH, YOU'RE GONNA BE 
IN A COMA, ALL RIGHT.

311
00:12:04,181 --> 00:12:06,558
narrator: UNFORTUNATELY, 
THE ACTOR WHO PLAYED TIO

312
00:12:06,558 --> 00:12:08,727
HAD ALSO STARRED 
IN A MEXICAN FILM

313
00:12:08,727 --> 00:12:14,358
ABOUT THE LIFE 
OF OSCAR DE LA HOYA.

314
00:12:14,358 --> 00:12:15,650
- GOB, HEY. 
- [gasps]

315
00:12:15,650 --> 00:12:16,651
- HEY, YOU ALL RIGHT?

316
00:12:16,651 --> 00:12:18,320
- WHERE AM I?

317
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:21,406
AM I IN 2/3 
OF A HOSPITAL ROOM?

318
00:12:21,406 --> 00:12:25,577
- YEAH, LISTEN, UM--

319
00:12:25,577 --> 00:12:28,873
[sighs] IT'S ME.

320
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:36,005
I'M THE GUY THAT SHE LIKES. 
"HERMANO" IS BROTHER.

321
00:12:36,005 --> 00:12:40,384
ME.

322
00:12:40,384 --> 00:12:43,137
- WELL, IF I'D KNOWN IT WAS YOU, 
I WOULDN'T HAVE MINDED.

323
00:12:43,137 --> 00:12:44,221
- YOU WOULDN'T?

324
00:12:44,221 --> 00:12:48,642
- MICHAEL, YOU'RE A GREAT GUY.

325
00:12:48,642 --> 00:12:52,729
IF YOU LIKED HER, 
I WOULD HAVE SAID, "GO FOR IT."

326
00:12:52,729 --> 00:12:56,775
- I DO KIND OF LIKE HER.

327
00:12:56,775 --> 00:12:59,444
- GO FOR IT.

328
00:13:02,781 --> 00:13:04,950
- HI.

329
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:09,038
MY BROTHER SAID WE CAN DO IT.

330
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:11,999
THAT DIDN'T COME OUT 
AS ROMANTIC AS I'D HOPED, BUT--

331
00:13:16,586 --> 00:13:19,589
["Love is in the Air" playing]

332
00:13:21,926 --> 00:13:24,303
- EVERYTHING IS FINALLY PERFECT.

333
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:25,345
[phone ringing]

334
00:13:25,345 --> 00:13:27,014
- OH, WAIT. 
YOU JINXED IT.

335
00:13:27,014 --> 00:13:30,309
DON'T WORRY. 
I'LL TURN IT OFF.

336
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:31,518
MM. 
IT'S JUST MY MOTHER.

337
00:13:31,518 --> 00:13:35,564
SHE'S PROBABLY WORRIED 
ABOUT MY DAD'S HEARING.

338
00:13:35,564 --> 00:13:38,859
- OH, WITH MY DAD, 
IT IS THE VISION.

339
00:13:38,859 --> 00:13:40,777
narrator: 
MEANWHILE, TOBIAS TOLD LINDSAY

340
00:13:40,777 --> 00:13:41,904
THAT HE COULDN'T DO THE PART.

341
00:13:41,904 --> 00:13:43,405
- IT PLAYS NAKED, OKAY?

342
00:13:43,405 --> 00:13:46,366
- TOBIAS, WE'RE GONNA HAVE 
TO DEAL WITH THIS SOMETIME.

343
00:13:46,366 --> 00:13:48,743
I MEAN, I UNDERSTAND YOU NOT 
WANTING TO DO IT ON FILM,

344
00:13:48,743 --> 00:13:50,579
BUT YOU CAN'T EVEN GET 
UNDRESSED IN FRONT OF ME.

345
00:13:50,579 --> 00:13:52,957
- IT IS NOT YOU, LINDSAY.

346
00:13:52,957 --> 00:13:54,833
I CAN'T GET UNDRESSED ALONE.

347
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:57,377
I CAN'T GET UNDRESSED 
BY MYSELF.

348
00:13:57,377 --> 00:13:58,587
I MEAN, 
THIS IS A REAL AFFLICTION.

349
00:13:58,587 --> 00:14:01,090
YOU KNOW, I'M SORRY IT'S NOT 
RECOGNIZED HERE IN THE STATES.

350
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:02,632
BUT I KNOW FOR A FACT 
THAT THERE ARE TWO MEMBERS

351
00:14:02,632 --> 00:14:03,884
OF GERMAN PARLIAMENT.

352
00:14:03,884 --> 00:14:06,845
THEY'RE CALLED 
"NEIN WOHLSTANDIG" NUDE.

353
00:14:06,845 --> 00:14:08,263
BUT THEY'RE GERMAN, SO--

354
00:14:08,263 --> 00:14:10,765
I MEAN, THEY SPEAK GERMAN, 
SO THEY HAVE A DIFFERENT--

355
00:14:10,765 --> 00:14:12,101
- YEAH, WELL, IT'S NOT NORMAL,

356
00:14:12,101 --> 00:14:15,562
AND IGNORING IT ISN'T 
GONNA MAKE IT GO AWAY.

357
00:14:15,562 --> 00:14:18,732
YOU'VE GOT NOTHING 
TO BE ASHAMED OF.

358
00:14:18,732 --> 00:14:20,484
- PLEASE...

359
00:14:20,484 --> 00:14:22,777
PLEASE DON'T MAKE FUN.

360
00:14:22,777 --> 00:14:25,780
- I'M NOT MAKING FUN.

361
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:31,245
LOOK, HOW ABOUT 
WE DO THIS TOGETHER?

362
00:14:31,245 --> 00:14:35,249
YOU TAKE OFF YOUR SHIRT, 
AND I'LL TAKE OFF MY JACKET.

363
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:39,086
- YOU KNOW, THIS FAMILY CAN BE 
PRETTY SCREWED UP SOMETIMES.

364
00:14:39,086 --> 00:14:40,212
BUT THE GOOD NEWS IS--

365
00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:42,756
- ACTUALLY, 
I USED TO THINK THAT, TOO,

366
00:14:42,756 --> 00:14:45,134
BUT IT'S BETTER 
THAN THE ALTERNATIVE.

367
00:14:45,134 --> 00:14:46,843
- WELL, HAVE YOU EXPLORED 
ALL THE ALTERNATIVES?

368
00:14:46,843 --> 00:14:48,428
'CAUSE I GUESS 
WHAT I'M GETTING AT IS--

369
00:14:48,428 --> 00:14:50,639
- NO, BUT I'M GLAD I HAVE 
THIS FAMILY, YOU KNOW?

370
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:52,307
'CAUSE I KNOW I SAID SOME 
BAD STUFF,

371
00:14:52,307 --> 00:14:54,476
BUT IT'S MUCH BETTER 
HERE THAN IT WAS IN BOSTON.

372
00:14:54,476 --> 00:14:55,477
AND I HAVE A COUSIN HERE.

373
00:14:55,477 --> 00:14:59,398
SO EVEN IF MY PARENTS DO GET 
DIVORCED, I HAVE YOU, RIGHT?

374
00:14:59,398 --> 00:15:00,690
narrator: 
GEORGE MICHAEL REALIZED

375
00:15:00,690 --> 00:15:02,859
THAT NO MATTER HOW MUCH 
IT UPSET HIM,

376
00:15:02,859 --> 00:15:05,529
HE DIDN'T WANT TO TAKE 
MAEBY'S FAMILY AWAY FROM HER.

377
00:15:05,529 --> 00:15:07,447
- YEAH, YOU GOT US, ALL RIGHT.

378
00:15:07,447 --> 00:15:11,618
- NOW ALL I NEED 
IS A BOYFRIEND.

379
00:15:16,165 --> 00:15:17,499
narrator: 
LUCILLE WAS LEFT ALONE

380
00:15:17,499 --> 00:15:20,002
WITH HER OLDEST SON 
AT THE COURTHOUSE.

381
00:15:20,002 --> 00:15:22,504
- WELL, JUST YOU AND ME, HUH?

382
00:15:22,504 --> 00:15:24,589
GOD, WHY AM I THE ONLY ONE

383
00:15:24,589 --> 00:15:26,633
WHO EVER COMES THROUGH 
IN THIS FAMILY?

384
00:15:26,633 --> 00:15:29,886
narrator: AND GEORGE SR. 
WAS LED INTO THE COURTROOM.

385
00:15:29,886 --> 00:15:32,264
- WHERE THE HELL IS EVERYBODY? 
- I'M HERE, DAD.

386
00:15:32,264 --> 00:15:34,683
- I CAN'T BELIEVE NO ONE 
SHOWED UP.

387
00:15:34,683 --> 00:15:35,809
I DON'T KNOW. 
MAYBE IT'S FOR THE BEST.

388
00:15:35,809 --> 00:15:37,811
MAYBE--MAYBE I SHOULD 
JUST STAY IN PRISON

389
00:15:37,811 --> 00:15:39,271
SO MY FAMILY CAN BE FREE.

390
00:15:39,271 --> 00:15:42,691
- LOOK, YOU'RE MY HUSBAND, AND 
YOU BELONG BACK AT HOME WITH ME.

391
00:15:42,691 --> 00:15:45,694
- WOW. 
YOU REALLY LOVE ME.

392
00:15:45,694 --> 00:15:46,695
- CALL IT WHAT YOU WANT.

393
00:15:46,695 --> 00:15:49,281
I'M TIRED OF PAYING LUPE 
TO CLEAN ONE DISH.

394
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:51,158
- I'M SORRY, SORRY. 
I'M SO LATE.

395
00:15:51,158 --> 00:15:53,452
[pants] I HAD ANOTHER HEARING.

396
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:56,871
HERE'S THE GOOD NEWS: 
I THINK I'M GONNA GET OFF, HUH?

397
00:15:56,871 --> 00:15:59,208
I HAVE A GOOD LAWYER.

398
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:01,043
[smacks] 
YOU LOOK GREAT IN RED.

399
00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:04,379
OKAY.

400
00:16:04,379 --> 00:16:08,925
ANYHOO, WHAT ARE WE DOING HERE? 
WHAT'S THE PLAN?

401
00:16:08,925 --> 00:16:11,761
- THE PLAN? 
YOU'RE OUR LAWYER.

402
00:16:11,761 --> 00:16:16,350
- IT'S A FIGURE OF SPEECH. 
YOU'RE GONNA BE FINE.

403
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:18,310
- OH, FOR GOD'S SAKE.

404
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:21,063
HE'S ON HIS OWN FOR TWO DAYS, 
AND HE JOINS A GANG.

405
00:16:21,063 --> 00:16:22,272
- THESE GUYS?

406
00:16:22,272 --> 00:16:23,523
OH, I'VE GOT THEM 
FOR THE AFTERNOON.

407
00:16:23,523 --> 00:16:25,942
BESIDES, THEY'RE THE ONLY THING 
I HAVE LEFT

408
00:16:25,942 --> 00:16:26,943
TO LIVE FOR IN THIS WORLD.

409
00:16:26,943 --> 00:16:31,323
- OH, STOP BEING SO DRAMATIC. 
YOU KNOW WHERE I LIVE.

410
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:32,782
- I WASN'T TALKING 
ABOUT YOU, MOM.

411
00:16:32,782 --> 00:16:34,618
I WAS TALKING ABOUT MARTA.

412
00:16:34,618 --> 00:16:36,620
EXCUSE ME.

413
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:40,040
- WAIT, YOU WERE SERIOUS? 
'CAUSE I GOT NEWS FOR YOU, PAL.

414
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:42,376
MARTA'S BEEN INTERESTED 
IN MICHAEL.

415
00:16:42,376 --> 00:16:48,340
THAT'S RIGHT--DULL, 
NOTHING-GOING-ON-UPSTAIRS

416
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:49,883
MICHAEL.

417
00:16:49,883 --> 00:16:51,260
- YEAH, I KNOW.

418
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:52,927
I SAW THEM MAKING OUT 
AT HER FRONT DOOR.

419
00:16:52,927 --> 00:16:54,013
- WHAT? 
WHEN?

420
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:56,265
- JUST NOW. 
HUH!

421
00:16:56,265 --> 00:16:57,516
THE STUFF I'VE GOT 
TO WORK OUT WITH MARTA

422
00:16:57,516 --> 00:16:59,434
JUST KEEPS PILING UP.

423
00:16:59,434 --> 00:17:00,852
- UNBELIEVABLE.

424
00:17:00,852 --> 00:17:02,146
- ALL RISE.

425
00:17:02,146 --> 00:17:04,148

AT THE SCENE.

435

YOU SAID IT WAS OKAY.

437

AND NOTHING HAPPENED. 
- NO.

438
00:17:30,465 --> 00:17:32,134

[gavel raps]

440
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:35,095

441
00:17:35,095 --> 00:17:38,098
- WELL, SO WHAT?

442

IN ONE SITTING,

448
00:17:51,945 --> 00:17:54,114
PANICKED AND RAN 
WITH GREAT INTENSITY.

ONTO THE COURTHOUSE STEPS.

THIS WAS HIS OPPORTUNITY

THEY'LL ADD TEN YEARS 
TO YOUR SENTENCE.

461
00:18:16,886 --> 00:18:19,931

462
00:18:19,931 --> 00:18:21,100
- OH, GOOD.

463
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,684
WE BETTER GET YOU 
BACK IN YOUR CELL.

464
00:18:22,684 --> 00:18:26,938

I CAN'T, I CAN'T, I CAN'T.

468

THAT TOO.

470
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:47,251
YOU DID IT.

471
00:18:47,251 --> 00:18:50,504

472
00:18:50,504 --> 00:18:51,505

HAD DECIDED THAT PERHAPS

480
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:09,856

WITHOUT ANY OF THEM.

481
00:19:09,856 --> 00:19:12,817

- BUSTER, GET OUT OF THE WAY!

482
00:19:12,817 --> 00:19:13,818

490
00:19:28,041 --> 00:19:31,711

I THOUGHT YOU WERE GOOD PEOPLE.

491
00:19:31,711 --> 00:19:33,755
I THOUGHT YOU WERE NOBLE.

492

I-I-I THOUGHT YOU CARE ABOUT 
FAMILY, BUT YOU CLEARLY DON'T.

00:19:43,139 --> 00:19:45,309
- WAIT, WAIT. 
WHAT ABOUT--WHAT ABOUT ME?

496
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:48,437
- I'M SORRY, I'M NOT 
TOTALLY SURE WHO YOU ARE.

497
00:19:48,437 --> 00:19:51,315
- WOW! 
WOW.

498
00:19:51,315 --> 00:19:54,150
THAT'S WHAT IT FEELS LIKE 
TO GET PUNCHED IN THE FACE.

499
00:19:54,150 --> 00:19:55,527
- CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT?

500
00:19:55,527 --> 00:19:58,905
- YEAH, 
LECTURING US ABOUT FAMILY.

501
00:19:58,905 --> 00:20:01,991
- I MEAN, WHO NEEDS THAT?

502
00:20:01,991 --> 00:20:04,494
- AND WHAT ARE WE DOING? 
HEY, WE'RE BROTHERS.

503
00:20:04,494 --> 00:20:06,162
THAT'S GOT TO COUNT 
FOR SOMETHING.

504
00:20:06,162 --> 00:20:09,208
- THAT COUNTS FOR EVERYTHING.

505
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:10,959
- I'M NOT GONNA THROW IT AWAY 
OVER SOME WOMAN.

506
00:20:10,959 --> 00:20:13,962
- [chuckling] 
ESPECIALLY NOT MY WOMAN.

507
00:20:13,962 --> 00:20:15,672
BUT YOU'RE RIGHT. 
YOU'RE RIGHT.

508
00:20:15,672 --> 00:20:18,049
I MEAN, THIS IS WHAT'S REAL.

509
00:20:18,049 --> 00:20:21,886
THIS IS WHAT LASTS. 
EVERYTHING ELSE IS JUST PETTY.

510
00:20:21,886 --> 00:20:23,888
- YEAH, TOTALLY BENEATH US. 
- YEAH.

511
00:20:23,888 --> 00:20:26,182
- AND BY THE WAY, I DON'T KNOW 
HOW YOU CALL HER YOUR WOMAN

512
00:20:26,182 --> 00:20:28,227
WHEN SHE CLEARLY PREFERS ME,

513
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:29,519
AND SHE WAS ALL PREPARED

514
00:20:29,519 --> 00:20:31,688
TO BE MY GIRLFRIEND, 
CALLING ME HER BOYFRIEND--

515
00:20:31,688 --> 00:20:32,856
- WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, 
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

516
00:20:32,856 --> 00:20:34,233
HEY! 
- HANG ON ONE SECOND.

517
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:35,317
- NO, NO. 
FIRST OF ALL, THIS IS ALL MOOT,

518
00:20:35,317 --> 00:20:36,818
BECAUSE SHE 
NEVER GOT A CHANCE TO KNOW ME.

519
00:20:36,818 --> 00:20:40,864
NOW, WILL SOMEONE 
PLEASE HAVE THE DECENCY

520
00:20:40,864 --> 00:20:42,699
TO PUNCH ME IN THE FACE?

521
00:20:48,162 --> 00:20:51,375
AAH!

522
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:55,254
- WELL, IT'S EFFECTIVE. 
- YEAH, IT REALLY IS.

523
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:57,506
narrator: ON THE NEXT 
"ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT."

524
00:20:57,506 --> 00:20:59,258
TOBIAS QUIETLY OVERCOMPENSATES.

525
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:02,886
- [yawning] PLEASE TELL ME 
THERE'S SOME COFFEE LEFT.

526
00:21:02,886 --> 00:21:06,222
[groans] GIVE ME SOME.

527
00:21:06,222 --> 00:21:09,225
I SLEPT VERY WELL 
LAST NIGHT.
