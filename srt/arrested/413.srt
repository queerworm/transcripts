00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:13,375
NARRATOR:<i> George Michael Bluth</i>
<i>had never been</i>

2
00:00:13,417 --> 00:00:14,792
<i>-more popular.</i>
-GEORGE MICHAEL (laughing): No.

3
00:00:14,834 --> 00:00:16,417
<i>He was surrounded by people</i>

4
00:00:16,458 --> 00:00:19,000
<i>who were thrilled</i>
<i>to be in his company.</i>

5
00:00:19,041 --> 00:00:20,417
Carlos was just... tickling me.

6
00:00:20,458 --> 00:00:22,208
They're almost out of root beer.

7
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:24,250
So I got you one
with the last bit of root beer

8
00:00:24,291 --> 00:00:25,792
because I remember that
somebody was saying that, um,

9
00:00:25,834 --> 00:00:27,417
George Michael likes root beer.

10
00:00:27,458 --> 00:00:29,208
<i>And as his business</i>
<i>was taking off...</i>

11
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:30,750
I do. Thanks a lot.

12
00:00:30,792 --> 00:00:32,500
You guys don't have to do
all this, you know?

13
00:00:32,542 --> 00:00:33,667
This was just a little
get-together for my girlfriend

14
00:00:33,709 --> 00:00:35,500
to show her
I'm doing well, you know?

15
00:00:35,542 --> 00:00:36,583
<i>-...so was his romantic life.</i>
-Show her I'm an adult.

16
00:00:36,625 --> 00:00:37,834
Hey, stop it!

17
00:00:37,875 --> 00:00:39,291
You're dead, man,
you are so dead.

18
00:00:39,333 --> 00:00:41,250
That was the last
root beer snow cone.

19
00:00:41,291 --> 00:00:42,834
I got that for him, Carlos.

20
00:00:42,875 --> 00:00:44,417
Teach you for being such
a kiss ass, Terry.

21
00:00:44,458 --> 00:00:45,625
<i>And it was an ex-Bluth</i>
<i>Company employee...</i>

22
00:00:45,667 --> 00:00:47,500
TOM: Come on, you guys,
not cool.

23
00:00:47,542 --> 00:00:49,583
<i>...who was the most grateful</i>
<i>to be in his company.</i>

24
00:00:49,625 --> 00:00:51,625
-Want any of these?
-No, I'm fine.

25
00:00:51,667 --> 00:00:53,667
You know, I really appreciate
you guys doing all this.

26
00:00:53,709 --> 00:00:55,792
I just wish I understood...

27
00:00:55,834 --> 00:00:57,583
why.

28
00:00:57,625 --> 00:00:59,834
That's why--
because you could ask us

29
00:00:59,875 --> 00:01:01,792
why we do this,
and mean it.

30
00:01:01,834 --> 00:01:04,792
The fact that you could be
so down to earth...

31
00:01:04,834 --> 00:01:06,417
CARLOS:
And look so young.

32
00:01:06,458 --> 00:01:08,375
...while you're starting
this giant company.

33
00:01:08,417 --> 00:01:10,417
You created an opportunity
many of us

34
00:01:10,458 --> 00:01:12,125
thought we'd never have again.

35
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:16,333
See that's the part
I don't understand, Carlos.

36
00:01:16,375 --> 00:01:18,125
You know my name!
What's his name?

37
00:01:18,166 --> 00:01:19,500
-You're the kiss-ass, Carlos.
-What's his name?

38
00:01:19,542 --> 00:01:20,834
Okay, guys, I'm gonna learn
all your names.

39
00:01:20,875 --> 00:01:22,458
-I promise.
-REBEL: George.

40
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,166
<i>-And that's when he heard what</i>
-Rebel.

41
00:01:24,208 --> 00:01:26,291
<i>-had become his name.</i>
-What is all this?

42
00:01:26,333 --> 00:01:27,667
Oh, it's just a little surprise.

43
00:01:27,709 --> 00:01:29,417
-You did this for me?
-Yes!

44
00:01:29,458 --> 00:01:31,208
Well-well, they did it
for me, but...

45
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:34,166
but only because they knew I
wanted to do something for you.

46
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:36,875
Maybe we could talk
without your friends.

47
00:01:36,917 --> 00:01:38,375
I mean, these guys aren't
really my friends, you know.

48
00:01:38,417 --> 00:01:39,500
I barely know their names.
(laughs)

49
00:01:39,542 --> 00:01:41,583
I mean, I know Carlos, but...

50
00:01:41,625 --> 00:01:44,250
only because of that old song
"Carlos the Tickle Monster."

51
00:01:44,291 --> 00:01:45,667
Wait, what song is that?

52
00:01:45,709 --> 00:01:48,291
Oh, god, I knew he made that up.

53
00:01:48,333 --> 00:01:50,291
But it did help me remember.

54
00:01:50,333 --> 00:01:51,625
Anyway, don't worry about these
guys-- they're not listening

55
00:01:51,667 --> 00:01:53,125
to a word we're saying.

56
00:01:53,166 --> 00:01:54,125
How about that kiss?

57
00:01:54,166 --> 00:01:55,542
We need to talk.

58
00:01:55,583 --> 00:01:58,917
(partygoers oohing)

59
00:01:58,959 --> 00:02:00,667
NARRATOR:<i> Now the story</i>
<i>of a family</i>

60
00:02:00,709 --> 00:02:03,250
<i>whose future</i>
<i>was abruptly cancelled</i>

61
00:02:03,291 --> 00:02:05,542
<i>and the one son</i>
<i>who had no choice</i>

62
00:02:05,583 --> 00:02:07,750
but to keep himself together.

63
00:02:11,166 --> 00:02:14,500
<i>It's George Michael's</i>
<i>"Arrested Development."</i>

64
00:02:17,166 --> 00:02:19,417
<i>George Michael's life</i>
<i>was very different</i>

65
00:02:19,458 --> 00:02:21,375
<i>months before developing</i>

66
00:02:21,417 --> 00:02:22,917
<i>the software program that would</i>

67
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:24,834
<i>change his life.</i>

68
00:02:24,875 --> 00:02:27,166
<i>♪ Those balls in the air ♪ </i>

69
00:02:27,208 --> 00:02:30,792
<i>♪ Those balls</i>
<i>in the air. ♪</i>

70
00:02:33,291 --> 00:02:35,333
-(music stops)
-And...

71
00:02:35,375 --> 00:02:37,375
that's where
the song should've ended.

72
00:02:37,417 --> 00:02:39,375
So I guess we all
got a little carried away.

73
00:02:39,417 --> 00:02:41,500
Are you sure?
We all ended at the same time.

74
00:02:41,542 --> 00:02:43,417
Yeah, well, it's because
you all sped up together.

75
00:02:43,458 --> 00:02:44,709
(laughs) Now, you know if I was

76
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:46,291
playing in your band,
I would say,

77
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:47,834
"Hey, you know, let's do
the whole fast and loose

78
00:02:47,875 --> 00:02:49,166
with tempo thing."

79
00:02:49,208 --> 00:02:50,208
But this is about my demo tape

80
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:51,208
to Juilliard and they've got

81
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:52,792
to dig what I do so much

82
00:02:52,834 --> 00:02:54,959
that they start an entire
department for wood block.

83
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,417
So I'm sorry guys.

84
00:02:56,458 --> 00:02:57,750
And you're leaving, okay.

85
00:02:57,792 --> 00:02:58,750
They left early.

86
00:02:58,792 --> 00:03:00,375
Proves my point.

87
00:03:00,417 --> 00:03:02,583
She was cute.

88
00:03:02,625 --> 00:03:03,834
They were playing way too loud
anyway, right?

89
00:03:03,875 --> 00:03:04,875
Could you even hear
the wood block?

90
00:03:04,917 --> 00:03:06,166
Right at the end.

91
00:03:06,208 --> 00:03:07,959
We could record you separately,

92
00:03:08,041 --> 00:03:09,458
and then mix it louder
on the computer.

93
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:10,792
Well, then I'm not playing
in a band.

94
00:03:10,834 --> 00:03:12,583
I mean, the whole point
of the band

95
00:03:12,625 --> 00:03:14,542
is to showcase
my amazing internal clock.

96
00:03:14,583 --> 00:03:16,291
You know, that's something
you have to be born with.

97
00:03:16,333 --> 00:03:17,792
<i>Or bred with.</i>

98
00:03:17,834 --> 00:03:19,834
<i>Which was the case</i>
<i>with George Michael.</i>

99
00:03:19,875 --> 00:03:22,834
<i>Who, as a small child, appeared</i>
<i>in a promotional video</i>

100
00:03:22,875 --> 00:03:25,208
<i>for a developmental</i>
<i>tool called "BabyTock"</i>

101
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:28,208
<i>BabyTock! will give your child</i>
<i>a head start at math.</i>

102
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:31,000
<i>And if I were a doctor,</i>
<i>I would guarantee you</i>

103
00:03:31,041 --> 00:03:34,709
<i>that it would also boost</i>
<i>their brain power 110%.</i>

104
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:37,625
<i>That's a lot of brain power.</i>

105
00:03:37,667 --> 00:03:39,875
<i>You've been using</i>
<i>BabyTock!, correct?</i>

106
00:03:39,917 --> 00:03:42,250
<i>-For how long?</i>
-TRACEY:<i> For two months.</i>

107
00:03:42,291 --> 00:03:45,625
<i>But George Michael really enjoys</i>
<i>listening to the sound.</i>

108
00:03:45,667 --> 00:03:47,417
<i>And would you say it's...</i>

109
00:03:47,458 --> 00:03:49,709
<i>changed the power of his brain?</i>

110
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:51,917
<i>Uh, well, that's impossible...</i>

111
00:03:51,959 --> 00:03:53,959
LUCILLE:<i> To deny.</i>

112
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,500
<i>I've always wanted</i>
<i>a smart baby.</i>

113
00:03:56,542 --> 00:03:58,625
<i>This thing really works, George.</i>

114
00:03:58,667 --> 00:04:00,959
<i>In fact it came from</i>
<i>something that didn't.</i>

115
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,250
So we're stuck with 5,000 of
these worthless corn-ballers?

116
00:04:05,291 --> 00:04:07,667
<i>When they were looking to</i>
<i>recoup some of their costs</i>

117
00:04:07,709 --> 00:04:10,417
<i>after an ill-fated foray</i>

118
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:12,792
<i>into the fry-at-home</i>
<i>snack-food market.</i>

119
00:04:12,834 --> 00:04:13,792
Whoa, whoa.

120
00:04:13,834 --> 00:04:15,500
They're not worthless.

121
00:04:15,542 --> 00:04:17,583
You know? The timer still works.

122
00:04:17,625 --> 00:04:20,000
There's no numbers on it,
but it's very loud, so...

123
00:04:20,041 --> 00:04:23,458
Perfect for those
who like the sound of a clock,

124
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:24,750
but don't know their numbers.

125
00:04:24,792 --> 00:04:26,041
That's good.

126
00:04:26,083 --> 00:04:28,250
We'll sell this to baby...
(yells)

127
00:04:28,291 --> 00:04:30,333
Mother of (bleep)!

128
00:04:30,375 --> 00:04:32,375
We should put these in cribs.

129
00:04:32,417 --> 00:04:34,333
That's not a half puny thought.

130
00:04:34,375 --> 00:04:35,583
GEORGE MICHAEL:
<i>And that Julliard thing is</i>

131
00:04:35,625 --> 00:04:36,792
confidential
from my Dad by the way.

132
00:04:36,834 --> 00:04:38,250
He's never gonna
want me to pursue

133
00:04:38,291 --> 00:04:40,333
-a career in...
-Hitting a block of wood.

134
00:04:40,375 --> 00:04:42,083
Music, yes

135
00:04:42,125 --> 00:04:44,083
You know, he still thinks of me
as the same George Michael

136
00:04:44,125 --> 00:04:45,500
that I was before my life

137
00:04:45,542 --> 00:04:46,917
blew apart, you know?

138
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:48,792
Before the world cracked me open

139
00:04:48,834 --> 00:04:50,917
and I became the guy
that you're looking at now.

140
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:52,667
George Michael 2.0.

141
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:54,792
God, I hate my name.

142
00:04:54,834 --> 00:04:56,500
<i>The last five years</i>

143
00:04:56,542 --> 00:04:58,291
<i>had been a whirlwind</i>
<i>for George Michael.</i>

144
00:04:58,333 --> 00:05:01,041
<i>He celebrated</i>
<i>going off to college</i>

145
00:05:01,083 --> 00:05:02,500
<i>-at a party with his family.</i>
-Hey! Next week, huh?

146
00:05:02,542 --> 00:05:05,417
-Congratulations!
-Thanks.

147
00:05:05,458 --> 00:05:08,291
-We are so proud. 
-We have a little 
something for you.

148
00:05:08,333 --> 00:05:09,709
Oh, no, you don't have
to do anything.

149
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:12,083
I mean, you threw me this...
meeting.

150
00:05:12,125 --> 00:05:14,709
Little something-something...

151
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:16,083
to buy a car.

152
00:05:16,125 --> 00:05:17,750
(laughs): Oh, God, really?

153
00:05:19,792 --> 00:05:20,959
-No!
-GEORGE: Yes.

154
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,417
-Maeby!
-(Maeby laughs)

155
00:05:23,458 --> 00:05:25,000
<i>But the party</i>
<i>wouldn't last long.</i>

156
00:05:25,041 --> 00:05:26,083
-(door opens)
-MICHAEL: You know what?

157
00:05:26,125 --> 00:05:27,709
I am done with this family.

158
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:29,333
I hope you've saved some money,

159
00:05:29,375 --> 00:05:30,959
'cause you're going to need
every dime now.

160
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,667
What's this?

161
00:05:32,709 --> 00:05:34,583
Return it...
or rip it up.

162
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:35,792
-Michael.
-Come on.

163
00:05:35,834 --> 00:05:37,375
Give it a rip.

164
00:05:37,417 --> 00:05:39,542
Rip it up--
right down the center.

165
00:05:46,375 --> 00:05:48,625
That's it. Rip it.

166
00:05:48,667 --> 00:05:50,000
Couple more.

167
00:05:51,375 --> 00:05:52,750
Did you get it?

168
00:05:52,792 --> 00:05:54,041
Proud of you.

169
00:05:54,083 --> 00:05:55,542
Happy birthday.

170
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:57,333
-GOB: Happy birthday, 
George Michael. 
-Happy birthday.

171
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:59,917
<i>ALL:</i>
<i>Happy birthday to you </i>

172
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:02,375
<i>- Happy birthday to you...</i>
<i>-But don't worry.</i>

173
00:06:02,417 --> 00:06:05,375
<i>Michael did make sure</i>
<i>his son got a car...</i>

174
00:06:05,417 --> 00:06:07,917
Get out of here.

175
00:06:07,959 --> 00:06:11,542
<i>...as he sent him off</i>

176
00:06:11,583 --> 00:06:12,917
<i>And although he arrived</i>
<i>at college</i>

177
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:14,625
<i>without his possessions,</i>

178
00:06:14,667 --> 00:06:17,792
<i>he was finally at a place</i>

179
00:06:17,834 --> 00:06:19,709
<i>-he'd fit in.</i>
-(metallic screeching)

180
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:20,792
MAN:
Hey, hey, check it out.

181
00:06:20,834 --> 00:06:22,542
(onlookers laughing)

182
00:06:24,125 --> 00:06:25,417
(truck door closes)

183
00:06:27,208 --> 00:06:29,625
(George Michael laughing)

184
00:06:29,667 --> 00:06:31,750
N-no.

185
00:06:31,792 --> 00:06:33,458
No, no.

186
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:36,041
(laughs): What?

187
00:06:38,959 --> 00:06:40,834
<i>In his Freshman year,</i>
<i>George Michael</i>

188
00:06:40,875 --> 00:06:43,834
<i>-hit the ground running.</i>
-Sorry.

189
00:06:43,875 --> 00:06:45,625
<i>He was breaking some</i>
<i>of the old taboos.</i>

190
00:06:45,667 --> 00:06:48,417
-Let's make it a... Pepsi.
<i>-Drinking Pepsi in the morning.</i>

191
00:06:48,458 --> 00:06:51,041
So, it's a breakfast combo
with a Pepsi.

192
00:06:51,083 --> 00:06:52,125
<i>Sometimes having eggs</i>
<i>at night.</i>

193
00:06:52,166 --> 00:06:54,417
How about some eggs?

194
00:06:54,458 --> 00:06:56,041
Oh, excuse me, I forgot
it wasn't morning.

195
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:58,417
<i>He was soon finding that others</i>
<i>enjoyed his sense of humor.</i>

196
00:06:58,458 --> 00:07:00,542
(laughing):
I forgot it wasn't morning.

197
00:07:00,583 --> 00:07:02,208
<i>A present</i>
<i>from his Uncle Gob elevated</i>

198
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:03,792
<i>-his newfound confidence.</i>
-Hi.

199
00:07:03,834 --> 00:07:06,000
My uncle is a magician.

200
00:07:06,041 --> 00:07:07,709
<i>Before diminishing it.</i>

201
00:07:09,542 --> 00:07:11,417
<i>But before he knew it</i>

202

<i>sophomore year was upon him,</i>

203
00:07:13,542 --> 00:07:16,041
<i>-and everything got turned up</i>
<i>to 11. </i>
-Boom!

204
00:07:16,083 --> 00:07:19,542
And that's what we call
only being behind by three.

205
00:07:19,583 --> 00:07:21,125
So then that stuff's all going
on with this Sitwell company.

206
00:07:21,166 --> 00:07:24,083
And then... we end up playing
them in a softball game.

207
00:07:24,125 --> 00:07:26,834
<i>Highlights-- loyal friends.</i>

208
00:07:26,875 --> 00:07:28,458
I'm like, "How can that...?"

209
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:30,208
<i>Romance.</i>

210
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:31,458
(muffled): Becky.

211
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:32,875
<i>Betrayal.</i>

212
00:07:32,917 --> 00:07:34,542
Becky?

213
00:07:34,583 --> 00:07:35,834
What's up, Ray?

214
00:07:35,875 --> 00:07:37,125
You guys broke up.

215
00:07:37,166 --> 00:07:40,000
Oh, thanks, Ray,
I almost forgot.

216
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,542
<i>The triumph of friendship.</i>

217
00:07:43,583 --> 00:07:44,625
-What's up, Ray?
-Hey.

218
00:07:44,667 --> 00:07:46,917
Oh, thanks, Ray,
I almost forgot.

219
00:07:46,959 --> 00:07:48,583
You know who I was thinking
about before you sat down?

220
00:07:48,625 --> 00:07:49,750
-What?
-Becky.

221
00:07:49,792 --> 00:07:51,125
Do you remember?

222
00:07:51,166 --> 00:07:53,625
<i>And as surely</i>
<i>as stability returned,</i>

223
00:07:53,667 --> 00:07:57,166
<i>junior year ushered in</i>
<i>a new era of experimentation...</i>

224
00:07:57,208 --> 00:07:58,667
It's all about the science
of kissing

225
00:07:58,709 --> 00:08:00,125
between a man and a woman.

226
00:08:00,166 --> 00:08:01,792
That always has fascinated me.

227
00:08:01,834 --> 00:08:03,250
Oh, good. Sheila will take you.

228
00:08:03,291 --> 00:08:04,750
<i>...as George Michael</i>
<i>tried to compensate</i>

229
00:08:04,792 --> 00:08:07,208
<i>for the lack of income</i>
<i>from his father</i>

230
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:10,041
<i>by volunteering</i>
<i>for experiments.</i>

231
00:08:10,083 --> 00:08:12,000
Hi.

232
00:08:12,041 --> 00:08:15,959
So I don't run off?

233
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,208
-I hope you're not feeling too
awkward. 
-Oh, don't be crazy.

234
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:20,875
-Okay. 
-Now when the mouth
to mouth test begins,

235
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:24,000
I'm gonna be yelling out letters
that indicate mouth movements.

236
00:08:24,041 --> 00:08:25,625
What I need you to do is
just give me

237
00:08:25,667 --> 00:08:27,208
on a scale of one to ten
your pleasure level.

238
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:29,583
-Fine. 
-Ten being the most
pleasurable, one the least.

239
00:08:29,625 --> 00:08:31,500
Let's hope we get to ten.

240
00:08:31,542 --> 00:08:34,250
-Well, work our way up to it.
-Bringing in the mouth unit!

241
00:08:34,291 --> 00:08:36,667
<i>And that's when he realized</i>
<i>what the straps were for.</i>

242
00:08:36,709 --> 00:08:39,917
Is that...? Okay, I guess it's
not, uh, not gonna be a person.

243
00:08:39,959 --> 00:08:41,917
-And C?
-I think one on C.

244
00:08:41,959 --> 00:08:44,041
-M? M?
-Oh, one on...

245
00:08:44,083 --> 00:08:46,625
-M?
-One for sure on... one.

246
00:08:46,667 --> 00:08:47,959
-And Z? 
-One.

247
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,083
-N?
-One.

248
00:08:49,125 --> 00:08:50,959
-F? F?
-One. One.

249
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,333
<i>But it wasn't until</i>
<i>his year abroad</i>

250
00:08:53,375 --> 00:08:55,750
<i>that George Michael got</i>
<i>an education in life.</i>

251
00:08:58,834 --> 00:09:01,959
<i>Because after a year of trying</i>
<i>not to be an imposing guest</i>

252
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,333
<i>in his new country,</i>

253
00:09:03,375 --> 00:09:05,250
<i>he was ready</i>

254
00:09:05,291 --> 00:09:08,959
<i>for a summer that would end up</i>
<i>turning his life upside down...</i>

255
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
(both yelling in Spanish)

256
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,125
<i>...when the woman whose</i>
<i>children he was nannying...</i>

257
00:09:17,333 --> 00:09:18,917
(screams)

258
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:20,834
<i>...opened him up sexually.</i>

259
00:09:20,875 --> 00:09:23,083
Hey, hey, did Ernesto
get his 4:00?

260
00:09:24,792 --> 00:09:25,959
The drones are coming.

261
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,667
Nothing matters now.

262
00:09:33,792 --> 00:09:35,834
-Why do you kiss like this?
-Like what?

263
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:38,000
The teeth, they must
not be used like this.

264
00:09:38,041 --> 00:09:39,959
<i>It was actually a jaw and lip</i>

265
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,166
<i>retraction issue,</i>
<i>but she had neither a command</i>

266
00:09:42,208 --> 00:09:45,208
<i>of the language</i>
<i>nor the data that we do.</i>

267
00:09:46,375 --> 00:09:47,792
You make love like a boy.

268
00:09:47,834 --> 00:09:49,291
Spanish, speak to me in Spanish.

269
00:09:49,333 --> 00:09:51,208
Because the only way
that college credit is

270
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:52,583
actually activated
is if I have...

271
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:55,083
-Dominarme.
-Cook... cook at...

272
00:09:55,125 --> 00:09:56,750
-Cooking at you?
-Overpower me.

273
00:09:56,792 --> 00:09:58,834
Oh, yes, make me cry.

274
00:09:58,875 --> 00:10:00,125
You're a terrible mother.

275
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:02,000
(high-pitched crying)

276
00:10:02,041 --> 00:10:04,333
<i>And so it was a very different</i>
<i>George Michael</i>

277
00:10:04,375 --> 00:10:06,959
<i>that returned to school</i>
<i>for senior year.</i>

278

<i>Eager to unleash his new</i>

00:10:10,041 --> 00:10:13,250
<i>overt sexuality</i>
<i>on an unsuspecting campus.</i>

280
00:10:13,291 --> 00:10:14,667
(laughs) Hey, man.

281
00:10:14,709 --> 00:10:16,375
It gets better.

282
00:10:16,417 --> 00:10:17,625
(people laughing)

283
00:10:17,667 --> 00:10:19,041
<i>And for George Michael,</i>

284
00:10:19,083 --> 00:10:21,625
<i>senior year did get better.</i>

285
00:10:21,667 --> 00:10:23,417
<i>-He was like a king</i>
-I sort of feel like a king

<i>-returning to his castle...</i>
-returning to his castle.

287
00:10:25,834 --> 00:10:27,625
<i>only to discover</i>
<i>that they thought</i>

288
00:10:27,667 --> 00:10:29,083
<i>he was two kings.</i>

289
00:10:29,125 --> 00:10:30,750
Welcome to your castle.

290
00:10:30,792 --> 00:10:33,667
<i>And they had doubled the size</i>
<i>of his castle.</i>

291
00:10:33,709 --> 00:10:35,000
Double castle.

292
00:10:35,041 --> 00:10:36,917
BOTH: Can't wait
to meet Michael, George.

293
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:38,917
<i>It would be</i>
<i>the perfect backdrop</i>

294
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:41,375
<i>to unveil George Michael 2.0.</i>

295
00:10:41,417 --> 00:10:43,041
GEORGE MICHAEL:
Todo mio.

296
00:10:43,083 --> 00:10:46,000
Todo mia?

297
00:10:46,041 --> 00:10:48,083
Mio.

298
00:10:51,875 --> 00:10:53,959
<i>-(knocking)</i>
<i>-But George</i>
<i>Michael's development was about</i>

299
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,458
<i>-to be forestalled.</i>
-Hey.

300
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,959
-Dad.
-Pete died.

301
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,417
Oh, God.

302
00:11:00,458 --> 00:11:02,875
-Uh, who's, uh, Pete?
-Don't worry about it.

303
00:11:02,917 --> 00:11:04,458
Don't you worry about it.

304
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:05,917
I like this.

305
00:11:05,959 --> 00:11:07,417
-I like the mustache.
-Oh, yeah.

306
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:09,333
-Oh... it's kind of fun.
-That's great.

307
00:11:09,375 --> 00:11:10,709
Probably gonna want
to shave it off

308
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:12,375
before the start
of next quarter.

309
00:11:12,417 --> 00:11:13,875
Otherwise, they're gonna think
you're a musician, huh?

310
00:11:13,917 --> 00:11:15,917
But I love it... dude.

311
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:18,750
GEORGE MICHAEL:
I'm never going to be

312
00:11:18,792 --> 00:11:20,125
louder than an electric guitar.

313
00:11:20,166 --> 00:11:21,458
Maybe using a band to showcase

314
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:23,291
my wood block skill
is a dumb idea.

315
00:11:23,333 --> 00:11:24,875
P-HOUND:
Too bad there's no such thing

316
00:11:24,917 --> 00:11:26,709
as an electric wood block.

317
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:29,333
GEORGE MICHAEL: That sounds
like a mother of an invention.

318
00:11:29,375 --> 00:11:31,291
NARRATOR:
<i>And so they set to work</i>

319
00:11:31,333 --> 00:11:33,291
<i>inventing a downloadable app</i>

320
00:11:33,333 --> 00:11:35,291
<i>that would allow one</i>
<i>to play an electronic version</i>

321
00:11:35,333 --> 00:11:37,208
<i>of a wood block</i>
<i>on their smartphone.</i>

322
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:39,083
You see, that's important.

323
00:11:39,125 --> 00:11:40,709
Well, that's what it is.

324
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:42,125
So it's basically
like you'll always

325
00:11:42,166 --> 00:11:43,500
have a wood block with you.

326
00:11:43,542 --> 00:11:46,458
I can't believe nobody's
ever done this.

327
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:48,917
<i>A quick something search</i>
<i>would have shown the guys</i>

328
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:52,750
<i>that there were already three</i>
<i>wood block apps on the market.</i>

329
00:11:52,792 --> 00:11:54,417
So, there are three
on the market.

330
00:11:54,458 --> 00:11:56,333
<i>Which they did.</i>

331
00:11:56,375 --> 00:11:58,083
(George Michael
speaking Spanish)

332
00:11:58,125 --> 00:11:59,500
<i>But even after</i>
<i>doing that search,</i>

333
00:11:59,542 --> 00:12:01,125
<i>they were undeterred.</i>

334
00:12:01,166 --> 00:12:03,667
Download them.
Come on, let's do it.

335
00:12:03,709 --> 00:12:05,750
I hope we're not doing this
on my account.

336
00:12:05,792 --> 00:12:07,375
No, we're doing it
so that we can see

337
00:12:07,417 --> 00:12:08,583
what the competition is like.

338
00:12:08,625 --> 00:12:10,667
No, I mean on my iTunes account.

339
00:12:10,709 --> 00:12:11,959
It's 99 cents.

340
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,417
Yeah, times three.

341
00:12:13,458 --> 00:12:15,333
<i>And soon, they realized</i>

342
00:12:15,375 --> 00:12:18,417
<i>what kind of competition</i>
<i>they were up against.</i>

343
00:12:22,375 --> 00:12:23,875
Well, these are a (bleep) joke.

344
00:12:23,917 --> 00:12:25,625
-(laughing): I know.
-Where are the mallet options?

345
00:12:25,667 --> 00:12:27,959
There's no choice
of wood weight or grain type.

346
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,667
There's no diameter hole option.

347
00:12:29,709 --> 00:12:31,458
I mean, what is this, BabyTock?

348
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:32,750
-BabyTock?
-You know, the sharp

349
00:12:32,792 --> 00:12:34,500
metal box that you put
in the crib.

350
00:12:34,542 --> 00:12:36,291
Is that not a well-known...?

351
00:12:36,333 --> 00:12:38,041
-But this is fine.
<i>-And they set to work.</i>

352
00:12:38,083 --> 00:12:39,709
No, I understand that.
I get that.

353
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:41,667
But it just seems
like you're leaving a hole

354
00:12:41,709 --> 00:12:42,959
just right in the middle
of the block.

355
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,959
It won't be a block
on anything 3G.

356
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,041
<i>Although some of the work had</i>
<i>to happen outside the room.</i>

357
00:12:47,083 --> 00:12:48,875
Buddy, is that schoolwork?

358
00:12:48,917 --> 00:12:50,417
<i>Which was challenging.</i>

359
00:12:50,458 --> 00:12:53,709
<i>And soon, they were close</i>
<i>to finishing an app</i>

360
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:55,250
<i>they had decided to call...</i>

361
00:12:55,291 --> 00:12:56,875
Woodblock.

362
00:12:56,917 --> 00:12:58,417
It's taken.

363
00:12:59,583 --> 00:13:01,333
Blockwood.

364
00:13:02,333 --> 00:13:03,709
It's taken.

365
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:05,083
<i>And that's when</i>
<i>he came up with...</i>

366
00:13:05,125 --> 00:13:06,458
Block of Wood?

367
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:07,834
<i>-Which was also taken.</i>
-Wow.

368
00:13:07,875 --> 00:13:09,709
-Block-block?
-No.

369
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:11,417
People are going to think we're
in the chicken-noise business.

370
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:12,875
How is that a chicken noise?

371
00:13:12,917 --> 00:13:15,333
You know...
Well, it's kind of hard to do

372
00:13:15,375 --> 00:13:18,333
in these matador pants,
but, you know...

373
00:13:18,375 --> 00:13:20,750
-Block-bl... 
-(over phone):
Fakeblock is available.

374
00:13:20,792 --> 00:13:22,041
Do you want Fakeblock?

375
00:13:22,083 --> 00:13:23,834
Oh, uh, okay.
They have Fakeblock.

376
00:13:23,875 --> 00:13:25,583
Okay, yes, we'll take that.

377
00:13:25,625 --> 00:13:27,625
No problem.
That's no problem.

378
00:13:27,667 --> 00:13:29,583
Could you hang on
to that for me, please?

379
00:13:29,625 --> 00:13:31,917
And I'll call you back.
Thank you.

380
00:13:31,959 --> 00:13:34,625
It's $5,000 for the domain name,

381
00:13:34,667 --> 00:13:37,500
and then there's this whole
XML Web site fee.

382
00:13:37,542 --> 00:13:38,625
I got the last one.

383
00:13:38,667 --> 00:13:40,500
That was 99 cents.

384
00:13:40,542 --> 00:13:41,750
Times three.

385
00:13:41,792 --> 00:13:43,583
<i>And George Michael realized</i>

386
00:13:43,625 --> 00:13:45,083
<i>he needed to bring in</i>
<i>some cash.</i>

387
00:13:45,125 --> 00:13:46,667
We actually have a variety
of subjects

388
00:13:46,709 --> 00:13:48,542
that high school students
need tutoring in.

389
00:13:48,583 --> 00:13:50,375
If you want to just
take a look at that list

390
00:13:50,417 --> 00:13:51,959
and let me know if there's
anything there

391
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,625
-that you've handled before.
<i>-There was...</i>

392
00:13:53,667 --> 00:13:55,125
<i>although George Michael</i>

393
00:13:55,166 --> 00:13:57,041
<i>couldn't imagine</i>
<i>it was the same Maeby.</i>

394
00:13:57,083 --> 00:13:59,959
Is this "F" in "Maeby F."
her last name or her grade?

395
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,750
Oh, it's her last name.

396
00:14:01,792 --> 00:14:03,417
But her most recent grade is...

397
00:14:03,458 --> 00:14:06,959
well, this just shows
an Elvis Presley head.

398
00:14:08,041 --> 00:14:09,875
So, that bad?

399
00:14:09,917 --> 00:14:11,417
I'll take her.

400
00:14:11,458 --> 00:14:13,000
Stay on top of her.

401
00:14:13,041 --> 00:14:15,375
You may need
to ride her pretty hard.

402
00:14:15,417 --> 00:14:17,542
Hey, you must be...

403
00:14:17,583 --> 00:14:19,417
What?

404
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:21,709
-This is the girl
you broke up with? 
-Huh?

405
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:23,709
What is this?
(whispers): I can't wear this.

406
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:25,458
Yeah, well, we dated
for a while, but, you know,

407
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:26,792
I was a kid, and I didn't know

408
00:14:26,834 --> 00:14:28,792
how to kiss yet.
I don't know,

409
00:14:28,834 --> 00:14:30,375
for whatever reason,
I listened to my dad

410
00:14:30,417 --> 00:14:31,667
who said we shouldn't
make it work.

411
00:14:31,709 --> 00:14:33,667
-Was she your first?
-Cousin? No.

412
00:14:33,709 --> 00:14:36,000
Why would you... why would
your mind go right to...? No.

413
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:38,041
No, it's just that he was right.

414
00:14:38,083 --> 00:14:40,000
We were kids.
I wasn't yet O.S.

415
00:14:40,041 --> 00:14:41,500
<i>-Overtly sexual.</i>
-Overtly sexual.

416
00:14:41,542 --> 00:14:43,583
Right. As I live and breathe.
Crazy.

417
00:14:43,625 --> 00:14:45,458
-That's just crazy.
-(knock on door)

418
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:47,041
Okay, so listen.

419
00:14:47,083 --> 00:14:49,667
After I let her in, you go
and try and keep my dad out.

420
00:14:49,709 --> 00:14:51,959
All right? I can't let him
get in the way of this one.

421
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,125
Hey, you must be...

422
00:14:53,166 --> 00:14:54,458
But first,
he had to cover his tracks.

423
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:56,166
-What?
-This had to look like fate.

424
00:14:56,208 --> 00:14:57,792
-George Michael?
-Huh?

425
00:14:57,834 --> 00:14:59,834
What is this?
Maeby, what are you...

426
00:14:59,875 --> 00:15:02,166
doing here?

427
00:15:02,208 --> 00:15:04,542
-As I live and breathe.
<i>-But for the phrase, "as I live</i>

428
00:15:04,583 --> 00:15:06,208
-I thought you were the girl.
<i>-and breathe," he nailed it.</i>

429
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:07,834
I'm supposed to tutor
a kid from...

430
00:15:07,875 --> 00:15:10,500
High school. Yeah. That's me.

431
00:15:10,542 --> 00:15:12,583
Crazy. That is just crazy.

432
00:15:12,625 --> 00:15:14,500
<i>And even though George Michael</i>
<i>wanted to seduce her,</i>

433
00:15:14,542 --> 00:15:16,458
<i>he couldn't help but challenge</i>

434
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:17,959
<i>her strategy for staying</i>
<i>in high school.</i>

435
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,750
But still, I mean, you have
to make a living, right?

436
00:15:20,792 --> 00:15:22,208
Don't you need an education?

437
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:24,625
Well, don't forget--
I'm a Harris.

438
00:15:24,667 --> 00:15:26,667
-Harris?
-Yeah.

439
00:15:26,709 --> 00:15:28,792
Someone who "inharris"
a lot of money.

440
00:15:28,834 --> 00:15:30,208
Yeah, well, you know,

441
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:32,625
I wouldn't put all my Anns
in that basket.

442
00:15:32,667 --> 00:15:34,583
You know, it's fine.
You don't get it.

443
00:15:34,625 --> 00:15:36,125
You've never been a risk taker.

444
00:15:36,166 --> 00:15:37,625
I like to (bleep) with people.

445
00:15:37,667 --> 00:15:39,083
That's what I do.

446
00:15:39,125 --> 00:15:41,750
-I'm making a statement.
-P-HOUND: I love it.

447
00:15:41,792 --> 00:15:43,000
MAEBY:
You know, I knew you were cool

448
00:15:43,041 --> 00:15:44,041
when I saw you
wearing that shirt.

449
00:15:44,083 --> 00:15:46,000
Thanks.

450
00:15:46,041 --> 00:15:47,208
<i>More betrayal.</i>

451
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:48,583
Oh, no, I get it, too.

452
00:15:48,625 --> 00:15:50,208
No, I love... I love it, too.

453
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:54,458
You know, I...
I love to... love now.

454
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:56,709
<i>George Michael found himself</i>

455
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:58,709
<i>less overtly sexual</i>
<i>than he'd hoped.</i>

456
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:00,959
I made a 40-year-old woman
cry in Spain.

457
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,166
P-HOUND: I love making love
to Spanish women.

458
00:16:03,208 --> 00:16:05,041
Get out.

459
00:16:05,083 --> 00:16:07,583
<i>And George Michael slipped back</i>
<i>into seduction mode.</i>

460
00:16:07,625 --> 00:16:11,250
Oh, a man, a woman...

461
00:16:11,291 --> 00:16:12,875
a bedroom.

462
00:16:12,917 --> 00:16:16,917
Let's solve for "X."

463
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:19,083
I don't know
what you're talking about.

464
00:16:19,125 --> 00:16:21,917
Well, you know, in algebra,
you have an unknown element,

465
00:16:21,959 --> 00:16:24,125
and, uh, we call it "X,"
and then you have

466
00:16:24,166 --> 00:16:27,500
to solve for it to find out
what number "X" is.

467
00:16:27,542 --> 00:16:29,750
"X" isn't a number.

468
00:16:29,792 --> 00:16:31,750
So you don't even
really know the basic...

469
00:16:31,792 --> 00:16:33,750
<i>But in that moment,</i>
<i>the urge to educate her</i>

470
00:16:33,792 --> 00:16:35,709
<i>was more powerful</i>
<i>than the urge to kiss her.</i>

471
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:38,208
Let me show you. I'll just
show you some stuff real quick.

472
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:41,667
All right, so if you take
something like this-- 3X+1=10...

473
00:16:41,709 --> 00:16:43,208
<i>And with the</i>
<i>algebra lesson complete,</i>

474
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:44,917
<i>George Michael pivoted back</i>

475
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:46,917
<i>to his overtly sexual</i>
<i>seduction.</i>

476
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:49,208
Therefore, when I say,

477
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:53,625
"You and me in a bedroom,
let's solve for 'X,'" I'm...

478
00:16:53,667 --> 00:16:56,083
I'm stating it
as a kind of formula.

479
00:16:56,125 --> 00:16:57,625
Yeah, let's get wasted.

480
00:16:57,667 --> 00:16:59,750
Let's drink that formula.

481
00:16:59,792 --> 00:17:01,667
(chuckling):
It's not that kind of formula.

482
00:17:01,709 --> 00:17:03,667
No, I'll show you what
a formula is real quick,

483
00:17:03,709 --> 00:17:05,125
-'cause that's very important.

<i>And after a brief reunion,</i>
<i>George Michael had</i>

489

<i>another opportunity</i>

490
00:17:19,125 --> 00:17:21,625
He's got this privacy software,

492
00:17:23,834 --> 00:17:26,875
So its privacy software
that's also anti-piracy?

493
00:17:26,917 --> 00:17:29,750
<i>George Michael</i>
<i>weighed his options.</i>

494
00:17:29,792 --> 00:17:32,875
<i>Maeby had chastised him</i>
<i>for not taking risks,</i>

495
00:17:32,917 --> 00:17:34,959
<i>and what would be a bigger risk</i>

496
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,917
<i>than perpetuating a lie</i>
<i>about software</i>

497
00:17:36,959 --> 00:17:39,709
<i>just to ignite the passions</i>
<i>of a woman?</i>

498
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:42,083
<i>Of course, it would be a lie,</i>

499
00:17:42,125 --> 00:17:44,333
<i>and since Maeby wouldn't know</i>
<i>it was a lie,</i>

500
00:17:44,375 --> 00:17:46,792
<i>he wouldn't appear</i>
<i>to be taking a risk.</i>

501
00:17:46,834 --> 00:17:49,041
<i>Perhaps the bigger risk</i>
<i>was to tell his father</i>

502
00:17:49,083 --> 00:17:50,375
<i>he was lying.</i>

503
00:17:50,417 --> 00:17:52,000
<i>That he came up with it</i>

504

<i>After all, he wondered,</i>

<i>the course of action taken</i>
<i>by an overtly sexual man--</i>

<i>a man who owns a pair</i>

00:18:09,041 --> 00:18:11,208
<i>according to his unfailing</i>
<i>internal clock,</i>

511
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:14,125
<i>and it was time to come clean.</i>

512
00:18:14,166 --> 00:18:15,792
Well, thanks. Yeah.

513
00:18:15,834 --> 00:18:17,583
It's a... well, it's just
a Boolean-driven

514
00:18:17,625 --> 00:18:21,667
aggregation, really, of what
programmers call "hacker traps."

515
00:18:21,709 --> 00:18:24,667
<i>And he found himself</i>
<i>suddenly and effortlessly</i>

516
00:18:24,709 --> 00:18:27,583
<i>tapping into a long-inbred</i>
<i>instinct for lying.</i>

517
00:18:27,625 --> 00:18:30,792
<i>A Bluth taking</i>
<i>his first steps in deceit.</i>

518
00:18:30,834 --> 00:18:32,959
<i>But the more he talked,</i>

519
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,834
<i>the more he actually started</i>
<i>to like the idea.</i>

520
00:18:34,875 --> 00:18:36,625
So, you know,
in other words, when...

521
00:18:36,667 --> 00:18:38,417
when you have friends over,
you know, and you're...

522
00:18:38,458 --> 00:18:40,041
you're listening to music
and they want

523
00:18:40,083 --> 00:18:42,625
to steal your music
and copy your movies or...

524
00:18:42,667 --> 00:18:45,041
or just look at your photos,
you know, this prevents that.

525
00:18:45,083 --> 00:18:48,834
It just neutralizes that so it's
not even a threat anymore.

526
00:18:48,875 --> 00:18:50,875
It's called Fakeblock.

527
00:18:50,917 --> 00:18:52,834
-Great name. Right?
-Yeah, well, you know,

528
00:18:52,875 --> 00:18:54,125
it's super low-hanging fruit.

529
00:18:54,166 --> 00:18:55,750
Someone's going to do it.

530
00:18:55,792 --> 00:18:57,709
We're just trying to be
those guys, you know?

531
00:18:58,834 --> 00:19:00,291
<i>And, impressed with his</i>

532
00:19:00,333 --> 00:19:02,208
<i>-own invention...</i>
-It's a fake profile

533
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:03,959
that leads hackers away
from your actual data.

534
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,792
<i>...he set about making</i>
<i>an impossible dream a reality.</i>

535
00:19:05,834 --> 00:19:07,083
You mean something that keeps

536
00:19:07,125 --> 00:19:08,625
everything
on the Internet private

537
00:19:08,667 --> 00:19:09,625
and protects
everyone's digital rights?

538
00:19:09,667 --> 00:19:10,750
Yeah, I mean, think about it.

539
00:19:10,792 --> 00:19:12,208
Everyone has something

540
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:14,375
that they want removed
from the Internet.

541
00:19:14,417 --> 00:19:16,166
<i>George Michael certainly did.</i>

542
00:19:17,291 --> 00:19:18,917
<i>And if the new software served</i>

543
00:19:18,959 --> 00:19:20,959
<i>no other person</i>
<i>than removing this...</i>

544
00:19:22,959 --> 00:19:25,083
<i>...it would be worth it.</i>

545
00:19:25,125 --> 00:19:27,125
Ay, dios mio.

546
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:28,667
I mean, if we could make
something like that,

547
00:19:28,709 --> 00:19:30,166
it could be bigger
than Facebook.

548
00:19:30,208 --> 00:19:31,792
I mean, who wouldn't want
something like that?

549
00:19:31,834 --> 00:19:33,041
You think you can do it?

550
00:19:33,083 --> 00:19:34,709
No.

551
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:37,166
No, of course not. No.

552
00:19:37,208 --> 00:19:39,083
I mean, this is
my chance with Maeby,

553
00:19:39,125 --> 00:19:41,041
and I can't even
get rid of my own father.

554
00:19:41,083 --> 00:19:43,792
You know, what if we just did
a vote-- just the roommates?

555
00:19:43,834 --> 00:19:45,917
We do a quick vote,
and it's, "Ciao, Fathero."

556
00:19:45,959 --> 00:19:48,083
He's going to know
who voted against him.

557
00:19:48,125 --> 00:19:51,709
Not if I get him
to vote against himself.

558
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:54,125
Why would he do that?

559
00:19:54,166 --> 00:19:55,709
No, he wouldn't. He... I...

560
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:57,250
I was just leaning back,
so it looked like I...

561
00:19:57,291 --> 00:19:58,834
I got this chair again,
didn't I?

562
00:19:58,875 --> 00:20:01,208
Maybe I just need
to be clear and just say,

563
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:02,875
"I'm putting up a wall.

564
00:20:02,917 --> 00:20:05,125
We need to rework
our whole system here."

565
00:20:05,166 --> 00:20:07,875
Sounds like you guys are working
on your privacy software, huh?

566
00:20:07,917 --> 00:20:10,750
<i>And, long story short,</i>
<i>Michael did end up</i>

567
00:20:10,792 --> 00:20:13,458
<i>embracing the</i>
<i>voting-out-a-roommate idea.</i>

568
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:15,083
And it's, "Adios, brothiero."

569
00:20:15,125 --> 00:20:16,375
It cannot fail.

570
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:22,709
That was fun.

571
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:24,000
Did he look betrayed to you?

572
00:20:24,041 --> 00:20:25,417
He kind of always
looks that way.

573
00:20:25,458 --> 00:20:28,375
I'm going to catch the bus.

574
00:20:28,417 --> 00:20:30,333
-Bye.
-Well, uh, okay. Hey, listen.

575
00:20:30,375 --> 00:20:32,208
Are you going to come by
on Thursday or...?

576
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:35,166
Um, I don't think so.
I have this thing in L.A.

577
00:20:35,208 --> 00:20:36,875
Well, can you blow it off?
I mean, you know, you might want

578
00:20:36,917 --> 00:20:38,750
to get "graduating high school"
out of the way.

579
00:20:38,792 --> 00:20:41,458
Well, I'm getting a lifetime
achievement award at this gala.

580
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:44,500
Well, you might want to get that
out of the way, too, I guess.

581
00:20:44,542 --> 00:20:46,041
Yeah.

582
00:20:46,083 --> 00:20:47,834
Hey, you want me to go
with you to that or...?

583
00:20:47,875 --> 00:20:49,834
Yeah, I can pick you up
at your place.

584
00:20:49,875 --> 00:20:52,166
Oh, they're actually
shooting a thing at my place.

585
00:20:52,208 --> 00:20:54,166
<i>As it turns out, they'd end up</i>

586
00:20:54,208 --> 00:20:55,792
<i>-just clubbing a Thing.</i>
-Oh!

587
00:20:55,834 --> 00:20:58,250
You know what? Yeah, that might
actually be a good idea.

588
00:20:58,291 --> 00:21:00,166
Because I can't bring
any of my friends without

589
00:21:00,208 --> 00:21:01,542
getting permission slips
from their parents.

590
00:21:01,583 --> 00:21:03,875
Well, that's not really
a problem for me.

591
00:21:03,917 --> 00:21:06,125
Yeah, 'cause you just
betrayed yours, right?

592
00:21:06,166 --> 00:21:07,959
MAEBY (chuckling):
Awesome.

593
00:21:10,959 --> 00:21:13,208
<i>George Michael</i>
<i>and Maeby arrived</i>

594
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:16,250
<i>at a hotel busy</i>
<i>with three separate events.</i>

595
00:21:16,291 --> 00:21:17,792
(people laughing)

596
00:21:17,834 --> 00:21:20,208
GEORGE MICHAEL (laughing):
No, no, no...

597
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:23,333
Well, it's really nice to be out
with you as adults, you know?

598
00:21:23,375 --> 00:21:25,583
In Spain, they don't even eat
dinner until after 11:00 p.m.

599
00:21:25,625 --> 00:21:27,792
Wow, Spain really changed you.

600
00:21:27,834 --> 00:21:29,208
Well, you grow up
very quickly in Spain.

601
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:30,834
Oh, my God,
I know this guy. Hey.

602
00:21:30,875 --> 00:21:32,166
Hey, man. Hey.

603
00:21:32,208 --> 00:21:34,083
-Hey, man.
-Hey.

604
00:21:35,333 --> 00:21:37,458
What are you on?

605
00:21:39,166 --> 00:21:40,875
Oh, he's nobody.

606
00:21:40,917 --> 00:21:42,792
Oh. It's Justin.

607
00:21:42,834 --> 00:21:44,250
That's David Henrie.

608
00:21:44,291 --> 00:21:45,917
He's Justin from
Wizards of Waverly Place.

609
00:21:45,959 --> 00:21:47,125
Hmm.

610
00:21:47,166 --> 00:21:49,458
It's on a lot in Spain.

611
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:51,291
Well, I'm going to go mingle
with a bunch of 13-year-olds

612
00:21:51,333 --> 00:21:52,583
who think they can
still play fifth grade.

613
00:21:52,625 --> 00:21:54,041
-Have fun.
-I'll catch up.

614
00:21:54,083 --> 00:21:55,500
<i>And George Michael set out</i>

615
00:21:55,542 --> 00:21:58,000
<i>to re-unleash</i>
<i>his overtly sexual persona.</i>

616
00:21:58,041 --> 00:22:00,834
Well, gentlemen,
start your engines.

617
00:22:01,917 --> 00:22:03,083
Buenas noches, pequeço Scarlet.

618
00:22:03,125 --> 00:22:04,250
I will be needing a room,
please.

619
00:22:04,291 --> 00:22:06,125
How many nights?

620
00:22:06,166 --> 00:22:07,458
Two.
Sorry. No, just one night.

621
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:09,625
I thought you were saying
how many people.

622
00:22:09,667 --> 00:22:12,083
-And how many beds?
-Two.

623
00:22:12,125 --> 00:22:14,250
-Two.
-No. Uh, one bed.

624
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:16,125
Why give her the option?
Keep it real simple.

625
00:22:16,166 --> 00:22:19,125
One bed, one night, two people,
let's solve for "X." (laughs)

626
00:22:19,166 --> 00:22:22,542
-I hate young Hollywood.

627
00:22:22,583 --> 00:22:24,208
MAEBY:
<i>It's called Fakeblock, Mort.</i>
<i>It's going to blow Schnoodle</i>
<i>out of the water!</i>

628
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:27,333
<i>And it was on his way back to</i>
<i>Maeby that he heard her say...</i>

629
00:22:27,375 --> 00:22:28,959
Fakeblock's the next big thing.
It's called Fakeblock!

630
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,834
-What's this? You're talking...
talking about Fakeblock?
-Oh.

631
00:22:30,875 --> 00:22:34,834
-How does your privacy software
work? 
-Huh? It's private.

632
00:22:34,875 --> 00:22:36,208
<i>And that's how George Michael</i>
<i>not only met Rebel...</i>

633
00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:38,375
I don't want people
to know that I'm doing this.

634
00:22:38,417 --> 00:22:39,917
<i>...but finally found a way</i>
<i>to prove</i>

635
00:22:39,959 --> 00:22:42,333
<i>to Maeby</i>
<i>that he was a risk taker.</i>

636
00:22:42,375 --> 00:22:45,041
Yes. Yes. George Maharis.

637
00:22:45,083 --> 00:22:47,458
<i>Only to discover,</i>
<i>moments later...</i>

638
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:48,667
-Perfecto!
<i>-...that she was dating</i>

639
00:22:48,709 --> 00:22:51,875
<i>-an even bigger risk taker.</i>
-De nada.

640
00:22:51,917 --> 00:22:54,041
That's my undercover cop
boyfriend.

641
00:22:54,083 --> 00:22:56,000
I'm trying to get him in bed.

642
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:57,458
Boyfriend?

643
00:22:57,500 --> 00:23:00,959
So funny that didn't come up
in the car.

644
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,083
So, how does it work?

645
00:23:03,125 --> 00:23:05,375
Huh? How does what work?

646
00:23:05,417 --> 00:23:07,250
Your privacy software.

647
00:23:07,291 --> 00:23:09,917
How does it protect you
from piracy?

648
00:23:09,959 --> 00:23:11,500
Oh, I don't know.

649
00:23:11,542 --> 00:23:13,917
Don't worry about it.

650
00:23:13,959 --> 00:23:16,667
No, no, no. No, you really
piqued my interest.

651
00:23:16,709 --> 00:23:19,250
I'm sorry.

652
00:23:19,291 --> 00:23:21,625
<i>And discouraged</i>
<i>that he'd lost Maeby,</i>

653
00:23:21,667 --> 00:23:24,959
<i>he tried to salvage his night</i>

00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,291
<i>by taking a picture</i>
<i>of Gibby from "iCarly."</i>

655
00:23:27,333 --> 00:23:29,625
<i>As he was doing this,</i>

656
00:23:29,667 --> 00:23:32,166
(loud explosion,
people screaming)

657
00:23:32,208 --> 00:23:34,709
<i>The explosion caused</i>
<i>an electrical surge</i>

658
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:37,208
<i>rendering the Schnoodle</i>
<i>software inoperable.</i>

659
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:40,041
<i>Which, to those who saw him,</i>

660
00:23:40,083 --> 00:23:42,208
<i>seemed like a genius act</i>
<i>of cyber sabotage,</i>

661
00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:44,500
<i>which led to this.</i>

662
00:23:44,542 --> 00:23:47,375
-What happened?
-Ah, it's dead.

663
00:23:47,417 --> 00:23:50,000
That geek Maharis destroyed
the whole thing.

664
00:23:50,041 --> 00:23:52,583
And you know why?
Just because he could.

665
00:23:52,625 --> 00:23:55,458
Those Internet geniuses--
that's what they do. I'm ruined.

666
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:57,583
I'll probably never get
to drive the Schnoodle car.

667
00:23:57,625 --> 00:23:59,542
We should work together.

668
00:23:59,583 --> 00:24:02,709
-No.
-Smart.

669
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:05,250
<i>And a few days later,</i>

NARRATOR:
<i>By the time</i>

678
00:24:22,542 --> 00:24:24,125
<i>George Michael</i>
<i>returned to campus,</i>

679
00:24:24,166 --> 00:24:27,500
<i>even his roommate had heard</i>
<i>of George Maharis' Fakeblock.</i>

680
00:24:27,542 --> 00:24:29,458
This George Maharis guy stole
our name,

681
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:30,625
but we have it registered,

682
00:24:30,667 --> 00:24:31,792
so we can sell it
to him for a fortune.

683
00:24:31,834 --> 00:24:33,083
No, I am George Maharis!

684
00:24:33,125 --> 00:24:34,417
I'm behind the whole thing.

685
00:24:34,458 --> 00:24:36,125
I-I wanted to impress Maeby,

686
00:24:36,166 --> 00:24:38,250
so I told her that I created
this privacy software.

687
00:24:38,291 --> 00:24:40,041
Why would you do that?

688
00:24:40,083 --> 00:24:41,834
You know, it's like the time
that you told that girl

689
00:24:41,875 --> 00:24:43,375
that you were
George Takei's son.

690
00:24:43,417 --> 00:24:46,208
Well, it's too late.
This thing's taking off.

691
00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:49,125
They're saying Fakeblock
knocked out Schnoodle.

692
00:24:49,166 --> 00:24:50,959
That was a coincidence.
It must have been a power surge.

693
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,083
Well, we got to get something--
at least

694
00:24:53,125 --> 00:24:54,875
get our five grand back.

695
00:24:54,917 --> 00:24:56,458
Well, I put in the five grand,
you put in three dollars.

696
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:58,500
Well, you may have put
in the most money to Fakeblock,

697
00:24:58,542 --> 00:25:00,208
but I put in the first
three dollars,

698
00:25:00,250 --> 00:25:01,792
so that makes you a hop-on.

699
00:25:01,834 --> 00:25:03,458
No, you're the hop-on, Paul,

700
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:06,000
and I know exactly who
you're trying to hop on to.

701
00:25:06,041 --> 00:25:07,792
-Maeby.
-Maeby.

702
00:25:07,834 --> 00:25:11,208
Yeah, well, you know
she's dating a cop, right?

703
00:25:11,250 --> 00:25:12,542
-Yeah, she likes risk takers,
like the P... 
-MAEBY: Hi.

00:25:14,375 --> 00:25:16,750
Keep moving.
Can you believe this?

706
00:25:16,792 --> 00:25:18,417
<i>-Maeby was excited...</i>
-Fakeblock! It's exploding!

707

-I got my PR company fanning
it

708
00:25:20,375 --> 00:25:21,750
<i>the stakes were too high</i>
<i>for him to continue the lie.</i>

709
00:25:21,792 --> 00:25:22,959
...and I even cashed in a favor

710
00:25:23,041 --> 00:25:24,125
to get us mentioned
on "Mad Money."

711
00:25:24,166 --> 00:25:25,583
You know,
I think we just might want

712
00:25:25,625 --> 00:25:27,792
to slow down a little bit
on the whole Fakeblock thing

713
00:25:27,834 --> 00:25:29,500
'cause I'm still not 100%
finished with it.

714
00:25:29,542 --> 00:25:30,959
Well, how finished are you
with it?

715
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,208
200%? 500%

716
00:25:33,250 --> 00:25:34,792
I also feel like
I'm not 100% finished

717
00:25:34,834 --> 00:25:36,375
-with your math tutoring.
<i>-And then Maeby said something</i>

718
00:25:36,417 --> 00:25:40,333
<i>-that made his change his mind.</i>
-Do we have those books here?

719
00:25:40,375 --> 00:25:41,875
MAEBY:
I trust you, George Michael.

720
00:25:41,917 --> 00:25:43,041
I would not get into bed
with you

721
00:25:43,083 --> 00:25:44,375
on this thing
if I didn't trust you.

722
00:25:44,417 --> 00:25:47,583
No. Yeah, of... of course
you can trust me in bed.

723
00:25:47,625 --> 00:25:49,417
No, I mean, I trust you
not to take advantage of me.

724
00:25:49,458 --> 00:25:53,000
No. I wouldn't. We would...
we would just lie there.

725
00:25:53,041 --> 00:25:55,500
We'd just lie there? I mean,
I'm talking about business.

726
00:25:55,542 --> 00:25:59,041
So am I. That's why
we would just lie there.

727
00:25:59,083 --> 00:26:01,041
Okay. (laughs)
'Cause I was going to say,

728
00:26:01,083 --> 00:26:02,458
when you become
an Internet billionaire,

729
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:05,083
you could do whatever
you want with me in bed.

730
00:26:05,125 --> 00:26:07,041
<i>It was that. That's what</i>
<i>made him change his mind.</i>

731
00:26:07,083 --> 00:26:09,333
-I will. I will.
<i>-And if it was so wrong to lie,</i>

732
00:26:09,375 --> 00:26:11,500
<i>surely he would receive</i>
<i>some sort of sign.</i>

733
00:26:11,542 --> 00:26:13,458
Oh, hey, I should get this.

734
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:15,834
<i>-But that wasn't it.</i>
-Hi, Uncle Gob.

735
00:26:15,875 --> 00:26:17,250
<i>That was his uncle Gob wanting</i>
<i>to meet him at a gay club</i>

736
00:26:17,291 --> 00:26:18,834
<i>-to tell him his father</i>
-I need to see you tonight.

737

<i>-was anxious to see him.</i>
-It's about your father and you.

738
00:26:21,083 --> 00:26:22,583
Really? Is... is he upset?

739
00:26:22,625 --> 00:26:25,250
-GOB:<i> Do I seem like a clown </i>
<i>to you? </i>
-I got it.

740
00:26:25,291 --> 00:26:27,000
<i>George Michael was worried,</i>
<i>and even more so,</i>

741
00:26:27,041 --> 00:26:29,250
<i>when he caught up with his</i>

742
00:26:29,291 --> 00:26:31,041

743

<i>You know about Fakeblock?</i>
<i>You know that's my software.</i>

744
00:26:32,625 --> 00:26:35,041
I wonder if my dad thinks
I'm blowing him off

745
00:26:35,083 --> 00:26:37,125
because that's starting
to take off now.

746
00:26:37,166 --> 00:26:39,041
Well, you should go find out
'cause I do know

747
00:26:39,083 --> 00:26:41,291
that your dad is really,
really, really upset with you.

748
00:26:41,333 --> 00:26:43,125
He is upset?
I asked you that.

749
00:26:43,166 --> 00:26:45,291
That was literally
the first thing I asked you.

750
00:26:45,333 --> 00:26:47,250
So you're giving me
these crazy...

751
00:26:47,291 --> 00:26:48,875
Mad?

752
00:26:48,917 --> 00:26:50,917
<i>So, it was a very shaken</i>

753
00:26:50,959 --> 00:26:53,458

755
00:26:55,041 --> 00:26:56,875

Oh, hey, Donny!

761
00:27:06,375 --> 00:27:07,583
Hey, I had you
for a semester at Openings.

762
00:27:07,625 --> 00:27:09,166
Yeah, okay, all right.

763
00:27:09,208 --> 00:27:10,667
Hey, come. I'm-I'm his guest.

764
00:27:10,709 --> 00:27:12,333
Is this man your guest?

765
00:27:12,375 --> 00:27:14,083
Oh, no, no. I'm just
meeting my dad here.

766
00:27:14,125 --> 00:27:15,500
Oh, screw this. I'm going up.

767

-Oh, come on.
-Going up, going up.

768
00:27:17,125 --> 00:27:19,083
Oh, come on!

769
00:27:19,125 --> 00:27:21,917
Oh, some Openings child
you are, man!

770
00:27:21,959 --> 00:27:23,375
<i>And George Michael</i>
<i>girded himself</i>

771
00:27:23,417 --> 00:27:26,041
<i>for his first meeting</i>
<i>with his father</i>

772
00:27:26,083 --> 00:27:27,959
<i>since he voted him out</i>
<i>of the dorm.</i>

773
00:27:28,041 --> 00:27:29,458
Hi. Yeah, just a sea-breeze,
please.

774
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:31,125
Make it a strong one.

775
00:27:31,166 --> 00:27:32,500
Put some stank on that.

776
00:27:32,542 --> 00:27:34,083
George?

777
00:27:34,125 --> 00:27:36,125
George Maharis?

778
00:27:36,166 --> 00:27:38,083
<i>And that's when he heard</i>

779
00:27:38,125 --> 00:27:41,375
<i>the name he'd forgotten</i>
<i>he'd given out as his own.</i>

780
00:27:41,417 --> 00:27:43,959
<i>So he tried not</i>
<i>to act surprised to hear it</i>

781
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,333
<i>when he saw it was Rebel.</i>

782
00:27:45,375 --> 00:27:46,667
I see you.

783
00:27:46,709 --> 00:27:48,542
<i>Unfortunately,</i>
<i>that meant being stuck</i>

784
00:27:48,583 --> 00:27:50,166
<i>affecting a blasí attitude.</i>

785
00:27:50,208 --> 00:27:51,583
Rebel Alley?

786
00:27:51,625 --> 00:27:53,125
We spoke three days ago.

787
00:27:53,166 --> 00:27:55,166
I know, I know.
I remember.

788
00:27:55,208 --> 00:27:57,542
-Are you a member here?
-No, I'm not.

789
00:27:57,583 --> 00:27:59,500
No, I just walked in past
the big black security guard.

790
00:27:59,542 --> 00:28:01,625
<i>All of which now worked</i>
<i>against him.</i>

791
00:28:01,667 --> 00:28:02,875
Okay, you know what?

792
00:28:02,917 --> 00:28:05,542
I was trying to be nice,
but you're just a jerk.

793
00:28:05,583 --> 00:28:07,125
You're a bigger jerk
than Andy Richter over there!

794
00:28:07,166 --> 00:28:08,417
ANDY:
Loosen up, bitch.

795
00:28:08,458 --> 00:28:10,083
I'm Andy Richter!

796
00:28:10,125 --> 00:28:13,959
I probably make, like,
$8,000 a day or something.

797
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,083
Hey, I'm-I'm sorry. I-I...

798
00:28:16,125 --> 00:28:18,458
You know, I'm in the middle
of a whole thing

799
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:20,375
with my dad right now,
and I, um...

800
00:28:20,417 --> 00:28:23,291
I didn't mean to be...
however I just came off.

801
00:28:23,333 --> 00:28:24,458
Badly.

802
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:26,083
Well, I'm sorry, you know.

803
00:28:26,125 --> 00:28:28,041
I've never met
a beautiful actress before.

804
00:28:28,083 --> 00:28:29,333
Oh, so you do know who I am?

805
00:28:29,375 --> 00:28:30,959
God, of course
I know who you are!

806
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,959
You were in the remake
of "Dangerous Cousins."

807
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,959
I signed up to Netflix
because of that movie.

808
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,542
Uh-huh.

809
00:28:36,583 --> 00:28:38,959
I think I was thrown that
you were interested in who I am.

810
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,583
Well, you are George Maharis.

811
00:28:40,625 --> 00:28:42,667
-Everyone's talking about your
software company. 
-Oh, yeah.

812
00:28:42,709 --> 00:28:46,375
I'm sure women are just throwing
themselves at your feet.

813
00:28:46,417 --> 00:28:50,000
Well, you know, I, uh... I
prefer a woman who aims higher.

(Rebel laughs loudly,
George Michael laughs)

815

-That was funny.
-Yeah, I know.

816

-That was good. That was...
-Smooth.

817
00:28:56,625 --> 00:28:59,041
Smooth. Hey, we have

Okay, should we get a drink?
I'm buying.

00:29:40,667 --> 00:29:44,083
<i>But while Michael was</i>
<i>leaving a second message,</i>

840
00:29:44,125 --> 00:29:45,458
<i>George Michael</i>
<i>left one for him.</i>

841
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:47,667
-(phone chimes)
-Oh. Hey, hang on. This is you.

842
00:29:47,709 --> 00:29:49,583
Hey, it's me. You know what?

843
00:29:49,625 --> 00:29:52,291
I bet we're sitting in the exact
same traffic; this is a mess.

844
00:29:52,333 --> 00:29:54,125
<i>Now hoping to ensure</i>

845
00:29:54,166 --> 00:29:55,792
<i>that his father didn't make it</i>
<i>to their meeting.</i>

846
00:29:55,834 --> 00:29:57,250
Maybe that's better. Oh, God,
they're forcing us off.

847
00:29:57,291 --> 00:29:58,667
Oh, God, they're forcing us off,

848
00:29:58,709 --> 00:30:00,291
but you know,
we can just do this another time

849
00:30:00,333 --> 00:30:02,583
if that works.
Maybe that's better.

850
00:30:02,625 --> 00:30:05,375
Oh, they're closing the lanes.
Oh, this is beautiful.

851
00:30:05,417 --> 00:30:08,625
Same traffic. Unreal.

852
00:30:08,667 --> 00:30:10,750
Unreal. Kind of looking
around for you now.

853
00:30:10,792 --> 00:30:12,667
Maybe you're right near me.

854
00:30:12,709 --> 00:30:14,333
Anyhow, if you get this,

855
00:30:14,375 --> 00:30:18,208
maybe we will just meet...
somewhere else.

856
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:19,750
Gonna hang up now.

857
00:30:19,792 --> 00:30:22,083
I'm going to video this
and send it in to the news.

858
00:30:22,125 --> 00:30:23,709
Glad you're getting
some footage of this,

859
00:30:23,750 --> 00:30:25,417
'cause I can't really get
a good angle myself.

860
00:30:25,458 --> 00:30:27,709
They're forcing us off here
like a bunch of animals.

861
00:30:27,750 --> 00:30:29,792
You know, maybe we'll do this
another time, 'cause this is...

862
00:30:29,834 --> 00:30:31,625
It's sad to say,
but it's left me...

863
00:30:31,667 --> 00:30:33,208
<i>...animals. You know maybe</i>
<i>we'll do this another time.</i>

864
00:30:33,250 --> 00:30:34,500
<i>It's sad to say,</i>

865
00:30:34,542 --> 00:30:35,875
<i>but it's left me</i>
<i>pretty shaken up.</i>

866
00:30:35,917 --> 00:30:38,458
God, I just hope
there are no kids on that plane.

867
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:40,208
'Cause, you know, they don't
have any choice in the matter.

868
00:30:40,250 --> 00:30:42,250
-(phone chimes)
-Well, I'll tell you what.

869
00:30:42,291 --> 00:30:43,667
I feel worse
for the parents, okay?

870
00:30:43,709 --> 00:30:45,291
Probably the kids thought

871
00:30:45,333 --> 00:30:47,333
that they could fly the plane
all by themselves.

872
00:30:47,375 --> 00:30:50,542
Bet you 500 bucks they find
a dead kid behind the stick.

873
00:30:50,583 --> 00:30:53,417
You know, or maybe
on the dead dad's lap

874
00:30:53,458 --> 00:30:55,667
whose only fault was
loving that kid too much

875
00:30:55,709 --> 00:30:57,291
and letting him fly the plane.

876
00:30:57,333 --> 00:30:59,208
Next thing he knows,
he's bouncing of the top

877
00:30:59,250 --> 00:31:01,291
of the Sports Chalet onto
the express lane of the 605.

878
00:31:01,333 --> 00:31:03,125
-I'll bet you 500 bucks.
<i>-Michael was hurt</i>

879
00:31:03,166 --> 00:31:06,375
<i>-and on his way out...</i>
-See you. I'm out of your hair.

880
00:31:06,417 --> 00:31:08,291
<i>...when he heard something</i>
<i>that cheered him up.</i>

881
00:31:08,333 --> 00:31:10,125
<i>The guy that was harassing</i>
<i>Rebel-- he's on his way down.</i>

882
00:31:10,166 --> 00:31:11,625
Say, Rebel?

883
00:31:11,667 --> 00:31:14,125
Hey, Andy Richter.

884
00:31:14,166 --> 00:31:15,667
Michael Bluth.
How you doing, Andy?

885
00:31:15,709 --> 00:31:17,458
Oh, yeah. I-I'm Andy.

886
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:19,917
So, I know him.
Can I get on your membership,

887
00:31:19,959 --> 00:31:21,792
-and can you vouch for me? Okay?
-Oh, yeah, sure.

888
00:31:21,834 --> 00:31:22,875
Whatever you want--
it's on Andy.

889
00:31:22,917 --> 00:31:24,375
Thank you.

890
00:31:24,417 --> 00:31:25,834
It's on this rich (bleep)hole.

891
00:31:25,875 --> 00:31:29,458
Bye.

892
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:31,333
<i>But before Michael</i>
<i>could find Rebel,</i>

893
00:31:31,375 --> 00:31:33,750
<i>he ran into the man,</i>
<i>that at that point,</i>

894
00:31:33,792 --> 00:31:34,750
<i>he still thought</i>
<i>was her lover.</i>

895
00:31:34,792 --> 00:31:35,750
Ron!

896
00:31:35,792 --> 00:31:37,291
-Hey.
-No, no. It's Michael.

897
00:31:37,333 --> 00:31:40,542
Michael Bluth-- doing the film
about my family and...

898
00:31:40,583 --> 00:31:42,625
Yeah, when are we gonna get
your kid's signature, though?

899
00:31:42,667 --> 00:31:44,000
-Yeah, I'm working on it.
-Oh.

900
00:31:44,041 --> 00:31:45,333
-And I-I got a hold of him.
-Oh, oh.

901
00:31:45,375 --> 00:31:46,709
And we're gonna meet here
tonight,

902
00:31:46,750 --> 00:31:48,166
but I think
that he's blowing me off.

903
00:31:48,208 --> 00:31:50,583
Well, yeah,
kids will be kids, right?

904
00:31:50,625 --> 00:31:52,917
Well, you know, a month ago,
I would have told you

905
00:31:52,959 --> 00:31:55,291
that he and I were exactly
the same, that we were twins.

906
00:31:55,333 --> 00:32:00,041
But now, I wouldn't even think
of my son as my brother.

907
00:32:00,083 --> 00:32:03,291
You know, the thing is...

908
00:32:03,333 --> 00:32:05,625
He's busy.

909
00:32:09,083 --> 00:32:11,709
<i>George Michael finds himself</i>
<i>the subject</i>

910
00:32:11,750 --> 00:32:13,667
<i>of a lawsuit</i>
<i>over the ownership</i>

911
00:32:13,709 --> 00:32:15,625
<i>- of Fakeblock.</i>
-Could you put in a good word

912
00:32:15,667 --> 00:32:17,083
on the missing Lucille 2 case?

913
00:32:17,125 --> 00:32:18,542
That's a career maker.

914
00:32:18,583 --> 00:32:19,542
That's an O.J.

915
00:32:19,583 --> 00:32:21,166
You just need one of those. Huh?

916
00:32:21,208 --> 00:32:24,667
Uh, excuse me, uh, but
was it or was it not my client

917
00:32:24,709 --> 00:32:27,875
who put up the initial seed
money for the block software

918
00:32:27,917 --> 00:32:31,041
that served as the underlying
architecture of Fakeblock?

919
00:32:31,083 --> 00:32:33,750
-It was 99 cents.
-Times three. 

920
00:32:33,792 --> 00:32:35,208
Times three.

921
00:32:37,792 --> 00:32:40,500
Can I say something
to my client?

922
00:32:41,709 --> 00:32:42,750
Take to the sea!
