00:00:01,459 --> 00:00:03,169
narrator: NOW THE STORY 
OF A WEALTHY FAMILY

2
00:00:03,169 --> 00:00:04,420
WHO LOST EVERYTHING

3
00:00:04,420 --> 00:00:06,547
AND THE ONE SON 
WHO HAD NO CHOICE

4
00:00:06,547 --> 00:00:08,133
BUT TO KEEP THEM ALL TOGETHER.

5
00:00:13,138 --> 00:00:17,308
IT'S "ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT."

6
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:22,938
MICHAEL WAS SHARING HIS BED 
FOR THE FIRST TIME IN YEARS.

7
00:00:22,938 --> 00:00:27,360
UNFORTUNATELY, IT WAS WITH 
HIS YOUNGER BROTHER, BUSTER.

8
00:00:30,196 --> 00:00:31,489
- BUSTER.

9
00:00:32,990 --> 00:00:33,991
BUSTER.

10
00:00:33,991 --> 00:00:35,993
HEY-HEY. 
WHOA, WHOA. BUSTER!

11
00:00:35,993 --> 00:00:36,994
- HEY, BROTHER.

12
00:00:36,994 --> 00:00:39,664
- [sighs]

13
00:00:39,664 --> 00:00:43,334
I DON'T THINK US SLEEPING 
TOGETHER IS WORKING OUT.

14
00:00:43,334 --> 00:00:44,335
YOU'RE A GROWN MAN.

15
00:00:44,335 --> 00:00:46,379
YOU SHOULD BE LIVING 
WITH YOUR MOTHER.

16
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:47,880
- YEAH, I MISS MOM.

17
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:49,507
- I CAN TELL.

18
00:00:49,507 --> 00:00:50,925
HEY, GOOD MORNING.

19
00:00:50,925 --> 00:00:51,926
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

20
00:00:51,926 --> 00:00:54,179
- IT'S MY ETHICS ESSAY.

21
00:00:54,179 --> 00:00:56,556
I'M SUPPOSED TO WRITE 200 WORDS 
ON THE MORALITY OF WAR--

22
00:00:56,556 --> 00:00:59,350
WHETHER A PREEMPTIVE STRIKE 
IS EVER JUSTIFIED.

23
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:01,352
- ABSOLUTELY. IT'S PREEMPTIVE, 
YOU KNOW,

24
00:01:01,352 --> 00:01:03,438
HAPPENS BEFORE 
SOMETHING ELSE, SO.

25
00:01:03,438 --> 00:01:06,232
IF YOU CAN PREDICT AGGRESSION 
AND YOU WANNA SQUASH IT--

26
00:01:06,232 --> 00:01:07,650
I DON'T KNOW WHY 
YOU'RE NOT TYPING?

27
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:08,484
THIS IS ALL GOOD.

28
00:01:08,484 --> 00:01:09,819
- I'M NOT SURE 
IF MY ETHICS TEACHER

29
00:01:09,819 --> 00:01:11,862
WOULD LOVE 
IF I CHEATED ON MY ESSAY.

30
00:01:11,862 --> 00:01:14,157
- WELL, YOU JUST PASSED 
MY ETHICS TEST.

31
00:01:14,157 --> 00:01:16,076
narrator: IN FACT, 
GEORGE MICHAEL HAD DEVELOPED

32
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:18,453
A HOPELESS CRUSH 
ON HIS ETHICS TEACHER,

33
00:01:18,453 --> 00:01:20,080
A WOMAN NAMED BETH BAERLY.

34
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,707
- EVEN MINOR CRIMES 
ARE PUNISHABLE

35
00:01:22,707 --> 00:01:25,168
BY BRUTALLY CHOPPING OFF 
THE OFFENDER'S HAND.

36
00:01:25,168 --> 00:01:28,003
- MMM. NO RING.

37
00:01:28,003 --> 00:01:29,922
- CAN'T WAIT TO MEET HER 
AT PARENT-TEACHER NIGHT.

38
00:01:29,922 --> 00:01:30,840
- OH, YEAH. DAD, HEY, DAD,

39
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:33,050
TRY TO REMEMBER EVERYTHING 
SHE SAYS ABOUT ME, ALL RIGHT?

40
00:01:33,050 --> 00:01:35,428
- OKAY. 
- MICHAEL.

41
00:01:35,428 --> 00:01:38,013
I NEED YOU TO DO SOMETHING 
ABOUT MY SON.

42
00:01:38,013 --> 00:01:39,014
- I TOTALLY AGREE, MOM.

43
00:01:39,014 --> 00:01:40,433
BUSTER GOES HOME, 
WE FLIP THE MATTRESS,

44
00:01:40,433 --> 00:01:41,434
THIS NEVER HAPPENED.

45
00:01:41,434 --> 00:01:43,769
- NOT BUSTER. READ THIS.

46
00:01:47,648 --> 00:01:49,650
- DID YOU AND DAD 
ADOPT A CHILD?

47
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:51,736
- THE S.E.C. 
WAS ON TO US.

48
00:01:51,736 --> 00:01:54,947
YOUR FATHER THOUGHT IT WOULD 
MAKE US LOOK CHARITABLE.

49
00:01:54,947 --> 00:01:57,450
HE MUST HAVE FORGED 
MY SIGNATURE.

50
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:59,327
WELL, MAYBE I'LL GET A SON

51
00:01:59,327 --> 00:02:02,330
WHO WILL FINISH 
HIS COTTAGE CHEESE!

52
00:02:03,498 --> 00:02:05,375
YOU'VE GOT TO GET ME 
OUT OF THIS.

53
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:08,669
- I'LL CALL SOCIAL SERVICES, 
BUT YOU MUST TAKE BUSTER BACK.

54
00:02:08,669 --> 00:02:10,546
- OKAY. 
- GREAT.

55
00:02:10,546 --> 00:02:12,632
- BUT I'M NOT TAKING CARE 
OF HIM EITHER.

56
00:02:12,632 --> 00:02:13,633
I DON'T HAVE

57
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:16,093
THE MILK OF MOTHER'S KINDNESS 
IN ME ANYMORE.

58
00:02:16,093 --> 00:02:19,680
- YEAH, THAT UDDER'S BEEN DRY 
FOR A WHILE NOW, HASN'T IT?

59
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,681
KIND OF?

60
00:02:20,681 --> 00:02:22,850
[phone rings]

61
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:23,851
HELLO.

62
00:02:23,851 --> 00:02:24,852
- MICHAEL.

63
00:02:24,852 --> 00:02:27,147
I'VE GOT 
A COUPLE OF GIRLS HERE.

64
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:29,774
A COUPLE OF FUN GIRLS

65
00:02:29,774 --> 00:02:30,941
I THOUGHT 
I'D BRING YOU IN ON.

66
00:02:30,941 --> 00:02:33,027
- OH, I DON'T KNOW, GOB.

67
00:02:33,027 --> 00:02:35,571
- COME ON, MICHAEL. 
SO WE HAD A LITTLE DISAGREEMENT.

68
00:02:35,571 --> 00:02:37,157
narrator: RECENTLY, GOB 
HAD DISCOVERED

69
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:40,743
THAT MICHAEL WAS INTERESTED IN 
HIS NOW EX-GIRLFRIEND, MARTA.

70
00:02:40,743 --> 00:02:43,288
- I'M OFFERING YOU 
AN OLIVE BRANCH HERE.

71
00:02:43,288 --> 00:02:44,289
- YEAH-YEAH. NO. I-I KNOW.

72
00:02:44,289 --> 00:02:46,582
AND I-I APPRECIATE THAT. 
IT'S JUST THAT--

73
00:02:46,582 --> 00:02:48,543
- BESIDES, WHEN WAS THE LAST 
TIME YOU SLEPT WITH SOMEONE?

74
00:02:48,543 --> 00:02:49,544
- BUSTER.

75
00:02:49,544 --> 00:02:50,545
WHAT TIME AND WHERE?

76
00:02:50,545 --> 00:02:52,838
- narrator: MEANWHILE, LINDSAY 
WAS HELPING GEORGE MICHAEL

77
00:02:52,838 --> 00:02:53,839
WITH HIS HOMEWORK.

78
00:02:53,839 --> 00:02:55,925
- OH, COME ON, 
LET'S DO SOMETHING.

79
00:02:55,925 --> 00:02:56,926
IT'S JUST A STUPID ESSAY.

80
00:02:56,926 --> 00:02:57,968
- NO, I CAN'T.

81
00:02:57,968 --> 00:02:59,345
I DON'T WANT 
TO LET DOWN MS. BAERLY.

82
00:02:59,345 --> 00:03:02,097
SHE'S NICE, YOU KNOW.

83
00:03:02,097 --> 00:03:03,098
AND SHE'S INTERESTING--

84
00:03:03,098 --> 00:03:04,475
- AND PRETTY?

85
00:03:04,475 --> 00:03:08,187
- WELL, I DON'T KNOW WHY 
I'M TELLING YOU THIS.

86
00:03:08,187 --> 00:03:09,480
I GUESS 
THERE'S JUST SOME THINGS

87
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:10,981
YOU CAN'T REALLY 
SAY TO YOUR DAD.

88
00:03:10,981 --> 00:03:13,108
- AH, SOUNDS LIKE YOU'D 
LIKE HER TO BE MORE

89
00:03:13,108 --> 00:03:14,819
THAN JUST YOUR TEACHER.

90
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:15,903
narrator: LINDSAY BELIEVED

91
00:03:15,903 --> 00:03:18,906
THAT GEORGE MICHAEL 
WANTED TO FIX UP HIS FATHER,

92
00:03:18,906 --> 00:03:21,284
SO HE COULD FILL THE ROLE 
OF HIS MOTHER.

93
00:03:21,284 --> 00:03:23,703
- THERE'S NOTHING 
WRONG WITH THAT.

94
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:26,706
ALTHOUGH, I MUST SAY 
I'M A LITTLE HURT

95
00:03:26,706 --> 00:03:28,791
THAT YOU HAVEN'T CONSIDERED ME.

96
00:03:30,585 --> 00:03:31,586
- YOU'RE MY AUNT.

97
00:03:31,586 --> 00:03:33,379
- [scoffs] 
THAT DOESN'T MATTER.

98
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:34,839
AUNTS CAN FILL THAT ROLE.

99
00:03:34,839 --> 00:03:37,717
TEACHERS CAN FILL THAT ROLE.

100
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:40,595
AND, SOMEDAY, YOU'RE GONNA FIND 
THE RIGHT WOMAN

101
00:03:40,595 --> 00:03:42,430
TO FILL THAT ROLE,

102
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:45,683
BUT UNTIL THEN. I'LL BE 
RIGHT ACROSS THE HALL.

103
00:03:47,393 --> 00:03:49,562
narrator: LINDSAY HAD NEVER 
BEEN MORE PROUD

104
00:03:49,562 --> 00:03:53,190
OF ANYTHING SHE HAD SAID 
IN HER ENTIRE LIFE.

105
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:54,191
- YIKES.

106
00:03:54,191 --> 00:03:57,152
narrator: MEANWHILE, GOB WAS 
WAITING FOR MICHAEL TO SHOW UP.

107
00:03:57,152 --> 00:03:58,153
- OH, THERE HE IS.

108
00:03:58,153 --> 00:04:00,698
MICHAEL. 
- YES.

109
00:04:00,698 --> 00:04:03,200
- THIS IS SHANNON, THE GIRL 
I'VE BEEN TELLING YOU ALL ABOUT.

110
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,453
- YES. GIRL, INDEED-- 
YOUNG GIRL.

111
00:04:05,453 --> 00:04:06,871
THAT'S A YOUNG, YOUNG, 
YOUNG, GIRL.

112
00:04:06,871 --> 00:04:09,039
- YEAH, WELL, SHE'S 18. 
SO, IT'S LIKE--

113
00:04:09,039 --> 00:04:11,376
OH, AND THIS IS YOUR DATE, 
NAZH--

114
00:04:11,376 --> 00:04:13,085
- GALIA.

115
00:04:13,085 --> 00:04:15,380
- HELLO, MY GOD!

116
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:17,590
- WELL, SHANNON WOULDN'T GO OUT 
WITHOUT A CHAPERONE--

117
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:19,967
- RIGHT. 
- AND SO SHE'S YOUR DATE.

118
00:04:19,967 --> 00:04:20,968
narrator: IT WAS CLEAR

119
00:04:20,968 --> 00:04:22,887
THAT GOB WASN'T OFFERING 
AN OLIVE BRANCH AT ALL,

120
00:04:22,887 --> 00:04:23,888
AND, IN FACT,

121
00:04:23,888 --> 00:04:26,223
WAS STILL HARBORING 
SOME RESENTMENT OVER MARTA.

122
00:04:26,223 --> 00:04:28,225
- OH--[laughs]--NAGARMA, 
YOU'VE GOT A MUSTACHE.

123
00:04:28,225 --> 00:04:29,935
- HEY!

124
00:04:29,935 --> 00:04:31,604
- I MEAN, YOU'VE GOT 
MILK ON YOUR MUSTACHE.

125
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:32,605
- OH.

126
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:34,064
- [chuckles] I MEAN, YOU'VE GOT 
A MILK MUSTACHE.

127
00:04:34,064 --> 00:04:35,816
- YEAH. 
IT'S ADORABLE.

128
00:04:35,816 --> 00:04:37,735
YOU LOOK LIKE 
ONE OF THOSE "GOT MILK" MODELS.

129
00:04:37,735 --> 00:04:39,194
[men chuckling]

130
00:04:39,194 --> 00:04:41,447
narrator: BUT GOB MISTOOK 
MICHAEL'S BASIC HUMAN DECENCY

131
00:04:41,447 --> 00:04:42,532
FOR ROMANTIC INTEREST

132
00:04:42,532 --> 00:04:45,910
AND FELT A COMPETITIVE URGE 
TO STEP IN.

133
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:50,080
- BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, IT'S BEYOND 
ADORABLE AND E-EXOTIC.

134
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,624
I FIND YOU VERY ATTRACTIVE.

135
00:04:51,624 --> 00:04:54,168
all: REALLY?

136
00:04:54,168 --> 00:04:57,004
narrator: AND GEORGE SR. WAS 
ABOUT TO GET A SURPRISE VISITOR.

137
00:04:57,004 --> 00:04:58,423
- MR. BLUTH?

138
00:04:58,423 --> 00:05:00,591
I'M CINDI LIGHTBALLOON.

139
00:05:00,591 --> 00:05:05,513
I'VE STUDIED ALL YOUR TEACHINGS, 
AND I'VE PURCHASED EVERY TAPE.

140
00:05:05,513 --> 00:05:07,765
AND I WATCH 'EM 
OVER AND OVER.

141
00:05:07,765 --> 00:05:09,892
narrator: GEORGE SR. 
HAD RECENTLY MARKETED

142
00:05:09,892 --> 00:05:11,936
A LINE OF SELF-HELP TAPES,

143
00:05:11,936 --> 00:05:13,979
TOUTING HIS NEWLY DISCOVERED 
SPIRITUALITY.

144
00:05:13,979 --> 00:05:15,440
- I'VE ALSO LOST FOUR POUNDS

145
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,024
ON YOUR LOW-CARB 
BLUTH BANANA JAIL BARS.

146
00:05:17,024 --> 00:05:18,108
[giggles]

147
00:05:21,696 --> 00:05:24,449
I'VE COME TO LEARN 
AT YOUR FEET.

148
00:05:27,452 --> 00:05:28,994
- THAT'S A GOOD PLACE 
TO START.

149
00:05:30,788 --> 00:05:32,915
narrator: AND MICHAEL, 
FREE OF HIS DOUBLE DATE,

150
00:05:32,915 --> 00:05:35,250
MET LINDSAY 
AT PARENT-TEACHER NIGHT.

151
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:37,462
- HEY, LINDS, 
IS IT MY IMAGINATION

152
00:05:37,462 --> 00:05:38,463
OR DOES THIS RAPE ROOM

153
00:05:38,463 --> 00:05:40,089
HAVE THE SAME FLOOR PLAN 
AS OUR KITCHEN?

154
00:05:40,089 --> 00:05:42,007
- DID YOU MEET MS. BAERLY YET, 
THE ETHICS TEACHER?

155
00:05:42,007 --> 00:05:42,883
'CAUSE I JUST DID.

156
00:05:42,883 --> 00:05:45,135
- NO, NOT YET. 
LOOK, THESE ARE OUR CABINETS.

157
00:05:45,135 --> 00:05:47,680
- YEAH. WELL, I THINK 
SHE'S PERFECT FOR YOU.

158
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,681
- FOR ME? REALLY?

159
00:05:48,681 --> 00:05:50,140
- MM-HMM. 
- THANKS, BUT NO, LINDSAY.

160
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:52,142
I'VE ALREADY BEEN SET UP 
ONCE TODAY BY A SIBLING,

161
00:05:52,142 --> 00:05:53,811
AND I DON'T THINK 
YOU PEOPLE KNOW MY TYPE.

162
00:05:53,811 --> 00:05:55,605
- HEY, LOOK. 
IT'S NOT COMING FROM ME.

163
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:57,147
IT'S-IT'S GEORGE MICHAEL.

164
00:05:57,147 --> 00:05:58,148
HE TOLD ME.

165
00:05:58,148 --> 00:06:00,485
I THINK HE WANTS A MOTHER.

166
00:06:00,485 --> 00:06:01,527
- WELL, THAT'S RIDICULOUS.

167
00:06:01,527 --> 00:06:02,862
HE'S GOT YOU. 
HE'S GOT OUR MOTHER.

168
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:05,155
YOU'D THINK THAT WOULD TURN 
HIM OFF TO THE ENTIRE CONCEPT.

169
00:06:05,155 --> 00:06:07,157
BESIDES, I'M NOT GONNA RUSH OUT 
AND MARRY SOMEBODY

170
00:06:07,157 --> 00:06:10,786
JUST BECAUSE 
YOU THINK MY SON WOULD LIKE IT.

171
00:06:10,786 --> 00:06:11,787
- WELCOME.

172
00:06:11,787 --> 00:06:13,914
I'M MS. BAERLY, 
THE ETHICS TEACHER.

173
00:06:13,914 --> 00:06:16,000
MY GOAL IS TO TEACH 
YOUR CHILDREN

174
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,043
ABOUT THE PRECIOUSNESS OF LIFE

175
00:06:18,043 --> 00:06:20,838
THAT CAN BE LOST BY THE MINDLESS 
PULLING OF A TRIGGER.

176
00:06:20,838 --> 00:06:23,841
- MMM. NO RING.

177
00:06:28,513 --> 00:06:31,390
narrator: AND SO MICHAEL GOT TO 
KNOW HIS SON'S ETHICS TEACHER.

178
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:33,518
- ETHICS-- 
RIGHT AND WRONG.

179
00:06:33,518 --> 00:06:34,519
- [chuckles]

180
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:36,353
- HOW CAN ONE THING CAN BE RIGHT 
AND ANOTHER ONE BE WRONG?

181
00:06:36,353 --> 00:06:37,647
I MEAN, WHICH IS WHICH, 
YOU KNOW?

182
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:39,273
[both chuckling]

183
00:06:39,273 --> 00:06:41,734
- I GUESS THAT'S 
THE "RRRR" OF IT.

184
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:43,778
YOU KNOW, 
SO FRUSTRATING.

185
00:06:43,778 --> 00:06:44,779
- I DON'T KNOW.

186
00:06:44,779 --> 00:06:45,988
I MEAN, THEY JUST THREW 
THIS CLASS AT ME

187
00:06:45,988 --> 00:06:47,156
AFTER MR. DANIELS 
HAD A STROKE.

188
00:06:47,156 --> 00:06:48,198
- [laughs]

189
00:06:48,198 --> 00:06:49,199
- [laughs]

190
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:51,744
I HAD HIM, MR. DANIELS. 
HOW IS HE?

191
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:53,162
- OH, HE, YOU KNOW, 
HAD A STROKE.

192
00:06:53,162 --> 00:06:56,123
- OH. 
THOUGHT THAT YOU WERE JOKING.

193
00:06:56,123 --> 00:06:58,250
- NO, I WAS JUST LAUGHING 
'CAUSE YOU WERE LAUGHING.

194
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:00,252
- RIGHT. NO. 
YEAH. GOSH. HMM.

195
00:07:00,252 --> 00:07:01,253
- YEAH.

196
00:07:01,253 --> 00:07:03,631
- "RRRR!" 
- [laughs] "RRRR!"

197
00:07:03,631 --> 00:07:05,925
BUT, YOU KNOW, I-I-- I REALLY 
AM ANTIWAR AND ANTIVIOLENCE.

198
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:06,383
- UH-HUH.

199
00:07:06,383 --> 00:07:07,802
- AND I THINK 
I'M AN ETHICAL PERSON.

200
00:07:07,802 --> 00:07:08,594
- RIGHT.

201
00:07:08,594 --> 00:07:10,680
HERE'S 
AN ETHICAL QUESTION.

202
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:15,309
CAN-CAN A PARENT TAKE A TEACHER 
OUT FOR A DRINK? OR--

203
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:18,979
- I DON'T KNOW. 
UH, DO YOU HAVE A WIFE?

204
00:07:18,979 --> 00:07:20,648
- YEAH. 
BUT SHE'S DEAD.

205
00:07:20,648 --> 00:07:22,191
- [laughs] OH.

206
00:07:22,191 --> 00:07:25,027
[both laughing]

207
00:07:25,027 --> 00:07:27,738

HAVE YOU EVER BEEN MARRIED?

208
00:07:27,738 --> 00:07:30,032
- YEAH, SHE DIED.

209
00:07:30,032 --> 00:07:32,743
- OHH. 
GOD, WHY ARE WE LAUGHING?

210
00:07:32,743 --> 00:07:34,870
- I DON'T-- WELL, IT'S THE 
MR. DANIELS STROKE THING

211
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:36,163
ALL OVER AGAIN. 
- [laughs]

212
00:07:36,163 --> 00:07:38,123
- LET'S GO GET THAT DRINK.

213
00:07:38,123 --> 00:07:39,584
- YEAH, IT COULD ONLY HELP.

214
00:07:39,584 --> 00:07:40,585
- RRRR!

215
00:07:40,585 --> 00:07:42,462
- [laughing] 
RRR!

216
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:46,381
narrator: GEORGE SR. WAS DEALING 
WITH HIS OWN ADMIRER.

217
00:07:46,381 --> 00:07:50,595
- I'VE ALREADY TOLD 
YOU SO MANY OF MY SINS.

218
00:07:50,595 --> 00:07:52,888
MAYBE YOU COULD 
TELL ME SOME OF YOURS.

219
00:07:52,888 --> 00:07:55,432
- UH, WELL, THERE ARE 
LEGAL IMPLICATIONS TO THAT.

220
00:07:55,432 --> 00:07:56,433
BUT, UH, BACK TO YOUR SINS.

221
00:07:56,433 --> 00:07:58,393
UH, DO THAT ONE ABOUT THE, UH, 
[takes deep breath]

222
00:07:58,393 --> 00:08:03,023
LADIES' SHOWER 
IN YOUR COLLEGE DORM AGAIN.

00:08:04,692 --> 00:08:06,110
narrator: AND MICHAEL 
WAS ON HIS WAY

224
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:08,028
TO WHAT WOULD BE HIS SECOND DATE 
WITH MS. BAERLY.

225
00:08:08,028 --> 00:08:09,029
[ringing]

226
00:08:09,029 --> 00:08:10,490
- MICHAEL, 
THE LITTLE KOREAN IS HERE,

227
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:12,116
AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT 
TO DO WITH HIM.

228
00:08:12,116 --> 00:08:13,701
AT LEAST, 
I THINK IT'S A HIM.

229
00:08:13,701 --> 00:08:15,953
YOU GOT TO STRIP THEM 
DOWN TO NEXT TO NOTHING

230
00:08:15,953 --> 00:08:16,954
BEFORE YOU CAN EVEN TELL.

231
00:08:16,954 --> 00:08:17,955
- YEAH, MOM.

232
00:08:17,955 --> 00:08:19,665
I JUST SPOKE TO SOCIAL SERVICES,

233
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:21,751
AND ALTHOUGH 
THEY DON'T LIKE TO DO THIS,

234
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:24,044
IF YOU CAN PROVE THAT IT'S A BAD 
ENVIRONMENT FOR A CHILD--

235
00:08:24,044 --> 00:08:26,046
AND I WOULD SUGGEST SAYING 
WHAT YOU JUST SAID TO ME;

236
00:08:26,046 --> 00:08:27,757
DON'T CHANGE A WORD--

237
00:08:27,757 --> 00:08:28,799
THEY WILL TAKE HIM BACK.

238
00:08:28,799 --> 00:08:32,427
- HA, HA, HA. UH, 
DON'T GET TOO COMFORTABLE.

239
00:08:32,427 --> 00:08:35,472
SHOES ON, MISTER! 
SHOES ON!

240
00:08:35,472 --> 00:08:37,432
HE'S OUT OF CONTROL.

241
00:08:37,432 --> 00:08:38,433
[knocking]

242
00:08:38,433 --> 00:08:39,810
HOLD ON.

243
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:42,271

245
00:08:45,983 --> 00:08:46,984
WHO'S THAT?

246
00:08:48,068 --> 00:08:51,656
- THIS IS "ANNYONG," WHO YOUR 
FATHER AND I HAVE ADOPTED.

247
00:08:51,656 --> 00:08:55,200
- WHAT, I'M GONE FOR A COUPLE 
DAYS AND YOU FIND A NEW SON?

248
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,411
narrator: LUCILLE COULD SEE 
THAT HER SON WAS CONCERNED,

249
00:08:57,411 --> 00:08:59,454
EVEN JEALOUS.

250
00:08:59,454 --> 00:09:01,040
AND SHE KNEW HOW IT FELT 
TO BE OVERLOOKED.

251
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,416
- YES.

252
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:03,959
ANNYONG IS YOUR BROTHER NOW.

253
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:07,296

EXCUSE ME.

254
00:09:07,296 --> 00:09:08,714
OH, MICHAEL?

255
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:11,008
CALL IT OFF.

256
00:09:11,008 --> 00:09:13,594
I'M KEEPING HIM.

257
00:09:13,594 --> 00:09:14,762
- LOOK, 
I GOTTA CALL YOU BACK.

258
00:09:14,762 --> 00:09:16,096
- SWEET RIDE.

259
00:09:16,096 --> 00:09:18,683
ARE YOU MAKING 
DINNER RESERVATIONS?

260
00:09:18,683 --> 00:09:20,350
- NO, NO. 
THAT WAS MY MOM.

261
00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:22,019
SHE JUST HAD 
A LITTLE KOREAN DROPPED OFF.

262
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:24,271
- OOH, THAT SOUNDS GOOD. 
LET'S HAVE THAT.

263
00:09:30,527 --> 00:09:31,528
- HELLO.

AND AFTER THEIR DATE,

265
00:09:32,863 --> 00:09:37,117
MICHAEL TOOK A STEP 
HE HADN'T TAKEN IN YEARS.

266
00:09:37,117 --> 00:09:39,328
- OKAY, DO YOU THINK 
THIS IS A GOOD IDEA?

267
00:09:39,328 --> 00:09:42,707
- I THINK 
IT'S A GREAT IDEA.

268
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:44,917
- MMM.

269
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:46,961
SUCH A GOOD IDEA.

270
00:09:46,961 --> 00:09:49,922
- BUT HOW ARE WE GOING TO SNEAK 
IN WITHOUT WAKING EVERYONE UP?

271
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:52,216
- WE'LL TAKE THE STAIRS.

272
00:09:52,216 --> 00:09:54,844
[stairs rumbling]

273
00:09:54,844 --> 00:09:57,888
THIS MAY NOT HAVE BEEN 
MY BEST IDEA.

274
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:05,771
- I'M SORRY, MICHAEL.

275
00:10:09,524 --> 00:10:13,696
- I'M SORRY TOO, MICHAEL, 
BUT IT LOOKS LIKE WE'RE EVEN.

276

TRYING TO GET EVEN 
WITH ME ABOUT MARTA.

00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:26,125
BUT GOT BAD NEWS FOR YA.

282
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:28,002
I'M SEEING SOMEBODY ELSE.

283
00:10:28,002 --> 00:10:31,631

JUST OUT OF CURIOSITY--

284
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:34,049
I'M NOT GONNA TRY 
TO SLEEP WITH HER.

285
00:10:34,049 --> 00:10:35,843
- FORGET IT. I THOUGHT 
THAT THIS WAS BEHIND US.

286
00:10:35,843 --> 00:10:37,177
- IT IS BEHIND US.

287
00:10:37,177 --> 00:10:38,595
- GREAT. 
- WHEN I SLEEP WITH HER.

288
00:10:38,595 --> 00:10:40,139
'CAUSE I'M GONNA SLEEP WITH HER. 
YEAH.

289
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:42,432
I WAS LYING WHEN I SAID I WASN'T 
GONNA TO SLEEP WITH HER, SO--

290
00:10:42,432 --> 00:10:43,976
- COURSE SHE'D HAVE 
TO AGREE TO IT, GOB.

291
00:10:43,976 --> 00:10:45,936
- OH, I DON'T ANTICIPATE 
A PROBLEM WITH THAT, GUY.

292
00:10:45,936 --> 00:10:46,937

00:10:46,937 --> 00:10:48,605
'CAUSE I'VE SEEN 
SOME OF THE DOGS THAT YOU LIKE.

- I JUST SLEPT WITH ONE.

296
00:10:50,274 --> 00:10:52,276
- AGAIN, 
DIDN'T LIKE NAZHGALIA.

297
00:10:52,276 --> 00:10:53,277
- REALLY.

298
00:10:53,277 --> 00:10:54,945
- REALLY, AND GOOD LUCK 
GETTING RID OF HER.

299
00:10:54,945 --> 00:10:55,738
- OH, PLEASE.

300
00:10:55,738 --> 00:10:58,157
NOT A PROBLEM. SHE KNOWS IT WAS 
A ONE-TIME THING. TOTALLY COOL.

312
00:11:21,847 --> 00:11:23,348
- I'M SURE SHE DOESN'T 
LOVE SADDAM.

313
00:11:23,348 --> 00:11:28,145
I'M SURE SHE IS INTERESTED IN 
HIM AS A SUBJECT, YOU KNOW.

00:11:28,145 --> 00:11:29,313
- RIGHT. 
THAT'S WHAT I MEANT.

I MEAN, ABOUT HER.

I'M GONNA GO HOME

YOUR UNCLE GOB 
SLEPT WITH HER.

00:12:27,287 --> 00:12:29,039
WHY WOULD GOB SLEEP 
WITH MY ETHICS TEACHER?

340
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:30,457
- PROBABLY JUST 
TO GET EVEN WITH ME.

341
00:12:30,457 --> 00:12:32,084
- HOW WOULD THAT BE 
GETTING EVEN WITH YOU?

342
00:12:32,084 --> 00:12:33,502
I'M THE ONE 
THAT LIKES HER.

343
00:12:33,502 --> 00:12:35,880
- RIGHT. RIGHT.

344
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:36,881
NO, I KNOW.

345
00:12:36,881 --> 00:12:38,548
YOU AND I KNOW THAT, 
BUT GOB HE JUST--

346
00:12:38,548 --> 00:12:40,342
HE'S NOT THAT-THAT 
EXACT OF A TARGET SHOOTER,

347
00:12:40,342 --> 00:12:42,344
AND HE JUST KIND OF 
SPRAYS IT EVERYWHERE.

348
00:12:42,344 --> 00:12:43,345
YOU KNOW, BUT LISTEN,

349
00:12:43,345 --> 00:12:46,015
DID-DID YOU REALLY THINK 
THAT-THAT--THAT YOU HAD A--

350
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:48,058
I MEAN, SHE'S KINDA OLD FOR YOU, 
DON'T YOU THINK?

351
00:12:48,058 --> 00:12:49,393
- WE DON'T EVEN KNOW 
HOW OLD SHE IS.

352
00:12:49,393 --> 00:12:50,394
NO ONE DOES.

353
00:12:50,394 --> 00:12:52,062
SHE WAS CHAPERONING 
THE DIVERSITY DANCE,

354
00:12:52,062 --> 00:12:53,814
AND I THOUGHT, 
LIKE, MAYBE AS A JOKE THING,

355
00:12:53,814 --> 00:12:55,315
I'D GO UP 
TO HER AND BE, LIKE,

356
00:12:55,315 --> 00:12:57,442
"WELL, HEY, 
DO YOU WANT TO DANCE?"

357
00:12:57,442 --> 00:12:59,028
AND SHE'D BE, LIKE, 
"AH, WHAT THE HECK?"

358
00:12:59,028 --> 00:12:59,987
RIGHT? 
OR SOME--I DON'T KNOW.

359
00:12:59,987 --> 00:13:01,571
I DID IT DIFFERENTLY 
IN THE MIRROR, BUT--

360
00:13:01,571 --> 00:13:01,906
- RIGHT.

361
00:13:01,906 --> 00:13:04,116
- BUT, YOU KNOW, LIKE, WE'D 
BE JOKE DANCING OR SOMETHING.

362
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:05,617
- I GET IT. 
- I DIDN'T THINK IT THROUGH.

363
00:13:05,617 --> 00:13:07,202
- DON'T YOU THINK 
YOU SHOULD BE TAKING

364
00:13:07,202 --> 00:13:08,703
SOMEBODY YOUR OWN AGE 
TO THE DANCE?

365
00:13:08,703 --> 00:13:10,414
LIKE YOUR COUSIN.

366
00:13:10,414 --> 00:13:11,456
THAT'S A BAD EXAMPLE, BUT--

367
00:13:11,456 --> 00:13:13,375
- I FEEL SO STUPID.

368
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:14,376
I DEFACED A RARE BOOK

369
00:13:14,376 --> 00:13:17,421
TO GET THAT PICTURE OF SADDAM 
HUSSEIN IN A BATHING SUIT.

370
00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:20,424
- "WHAT WOULD SADDAM DO?"

371
00:13:20,424 --> 00:13:22,217
- YEAH. 
YEAH, YOU KNOW SOMETHING?

372
00:13:22,217 --> 00:13:24,011
YOU'RE RIGHT. GOB'S GONNA PAY.

373
00:13:28,557 --> 00:13:31,936
- OKAY, THAT IS OUR EXACT 
OUTDOOR FIRE PIT.

374
00:13:31,936 --> 00:13:33,187
narrator: AT PRISON, GEORGE SR.

375
00:13:33,187 --> 00:13:36,565
WAS PREPARING FOR AN EVENING 
WITH HIS MOST DEVOTED FAN.

376
00:13:36,565 --> 00:13:40,194
WHILE CINDI LIGHTBALLOON WAS 
MAKING PREPARATIONS OF HER OWN.

377
00:13:40,194 --> 00:13:42,112
- HOW WE DOIN'? 
- WE HAVE VIDEO.

378
00:13:42,112 --> 00:13:43,948
- TESTING ONE, TWO.

379
00:13:43,948 --> 00:13:46,951
- TILT BACK A LITTLE, 
WILL YOU, HARRIS?

380
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:49,578
- LET'S BUST THIS GUY. 
[blows smoke]

381
00:13:49,578 --> 00:13:52,039
narrator: SO GEORGE MICHAEL, 
STILL ANGRY AT GOB,

382
00:13:52,039 --> 00:13:54,875
SOUGHT OUT THE FAMILY EXPERT 
ON MAKING TROUBLE.

383
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:56,501
- I KNOW HE WAS DATING 
THAT GIRL SHANNON.

384
00:13:56,501 --> 00:13:58,628
- THE CHEERLEADER?

385
00:13:58,628 --> 00:14:00,089
- YEAH, SHE'S PROBABLY 
GONNA TAKE HIM

386
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:01,590
TO THAT STUPID DIVERSITY DANCE.

387
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:03,800
I WISH I HAD SOMEONE 
SHOCKING TO TAKE.

388
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:06,303
YOU KNOW, I ACTUALLY CALLED 
MR. DANIELS AND ASKED HIM,

389
00:14:06,303 --> 00:14:09,974
BUT HE GOT ALL OUT OF BREATH 
AND DROPPED THE PHONE.

390
00:14:09,974 --> 00:14:10,975
I NEVER HEARD BACK.

391
00:14:10,975 --> 00:14:13,477
- YOU KNOW, MAYBE--MAYBE 
WE SHOULD GO TOGETHER.

392
00:14:13,477 --> 00:14:17,689
RIGHT, I MEAN, IT'S A BAD 
EXAMPLE--I--BUT SHOULD WE?

393
00:14:17,689 --> 00:14:19,733
- HELLO.

394
00:14:19,733 --> 00:14:22,027
- YES, ANNYONG. 
YOUR NAME'S ANNYONG.

395
00:14:22,027 --> 00:14:24,654
WE ALL KNOW YOU'RE ANNYONG. 
ANNYONG. ANNYONG. ANNYONG.

396
00:14:24,654 --> 00:14:25,655
- WHO'S THIS?

397
00:14:25,655 --> 00:14:26,991
- OH, I'M SORRY. 
THIS IS ANNYONG.

398
00:14:28,033 --> 00:14:29,034
- MY MOM BOUGHT HIM.

399
00:14:29,034 --> 00:14:30,827
SHE'S MAKING ME 
REGISTER HIM FOR SCHOOL.

400
00:14:30,827 --> 00:14:32,662
HE'S MY NEW LITTLE BROTHER.

401
00:14:32,662 --> 00:14:34,831
- SO WE'RE RELATED.

402
00:14:34,831 --> 00:14:36,375
HEY, DO WANNA GO TO A DANCE?

403
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:39,794
- OH, GREAT, 
ANOTHER UNCLE TO COMPETE WITH.

404
00:14:39,794 --> 00:14:40,921
narrator: AND MICHAEL WENT

405
00:14:40,921 --> 00:14:43,257
TO DISCUSS THE GEORGE MICHAEL 
SITUATION WITH MS. BAERLY.

406
00:14:43,257 --> 00:14:45,968
- BEING HELD AGAINST THEIR WILL 
[giggles]

407
00:14:45,968 --> 00:14:49,013
PURELY ON THE BASIS OF 
POLITICAL OR RELIGIOUS BELIEFS.

408
00:14:49,013 --> 00:14:50,680
[giggling]

409
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:51,681
I'M SORRY.

410
00:14:51,681 --> 00:14:54,268
I MET SOMEONE. 
I'M SORRY.

411
00:14:54,268 --> 00:14:55,269
ANYWAY, THIS IS SERIOUS.

412
00:14:55,269 --> 00:14:58,480
THIS IS ATROCITIES. 
NO MORE SMILING.

413
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,481
[knocking]

414
00:14:59,481 --> 00:15:01,483
MICHAEL! 
UH, JUST A MINUTE.

415
00:15:03,818 --> 00:15:05,320
- HI. SORRY. 
- HI!

416
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:06,321
- DON'T WORRY.

417
00:15:06,321 --> 00:15:08,532
GEORGE MICHAEL'S NOT IN THERE. 
THOSE ARE DUMB KIDS.

418
00:15:08,532 --> 00:15:09,533
- OKAY.

419
00:15:09,533 --> 00:15:11,285
UM, LISTEN. 
THIS IS UH--

420
00:15:11,285 --> 00:15:13,203
- WOW! 
DID YOU MAKE THIS FOR ME?

421
00:15:13,203 --> 00:15:15,372
THIS IS SO SWEET. 
I LOVE HUSSEIN.

422
00:15:15,372 --> 00:15:17,499
- YOU MEAN, YOU'RE 
INTERESTED IN HIM.

423
00:15:17,499 --> 00:15:19,418
- OH, YES. HE IS A MONSTER.

424
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:20,419
- YEAH.

425
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:22,421
- WOW. WHERE DID YOU FIND 
THIS ONE OF HIM IN A SPEEDO?

426
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:24,464
- THIS IS WHAT I WANT TO TALK 
TO YOU ABOUT, THOUGH.

427
00:15:24,464 --> 00:15:27,342
UM, BETH, I DON'T THINK THAT 
I CAN CONTINUE TO SEE YOU.

428
00:15:27,342 --> 00:15:28,343
- [giggles]

429
00:15:28,343 --> 00:15:29,386
- [giggles]

430
00:15:29,386 --> 00:15:32,222
BUT I'VE ENJOYED 
MY TIME WITH YOU.

431
00:15:32,222 --> 00:15:33,348
YOU EVER WANNA TALK ETHICS--

432
00:15:33,348 --> 00:15:34,349
- YOU REALLY MEAN IT?

433
00:15:34,349 --> 00:15:36,560
THIS ISN'T ONE OF 
"MY WIFE DIED" JOKES?

434
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:37,894
- NO, I'M AFRAID 
THIS IS SERIOUS.

435
00:15:37,894 --> 00:15:39,229
- OH.

436
00:15:39,229 --> 00:15:42,066
- YOU SEE, GEORGE MICHAEL 
MADE THIS POSTER FOR YOU.

437
00:15:42,066 --> 00:15:45,860
YOU KNOW, HE-HE KIND OF, UH, 
IS IN LOVE WITH YOU, SO--

438
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:47,487
- I MEAN, 
HE KNOWS WE'RE GOING OUT.

439
00:15:47,487 --> 00:15:48,488
HE SAW ME THIS MORNING.

440
00:15:48,488 --> 00:15:49,781
- NO, I COVERED THAT.

441
00:15:49,781 --> 00:15:52,201
I TOLD HIM THAT YOU 
SLEPT WITH MY BROTHER.

442
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:55,495
- THAT MAY BE THE MOST UNETHICAL 
THING I'VE EVER HEARD.

443
00:15:55,495 --> 00:15:58,207
- WELL, YOU'VE ONLY BEEN DOING 
THIS HALF A SEMESTER.

444
00:15:58,207 --> 00:15:59,541
LOOK, IT WAS 
A PREEMPTIVE STRIKE.

445
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:01,751
MY BROTHER WOULD'VE 
TRIED TO SLEEP WITH YOU.

446
00:16:01,751 --> 00:16:05,047
- WELL, I WANT YOU TO LEAVE 
RIGHT NOW AND NOT COME BACK.

447
00:16:05,047 --> 00:16:05,464
- RIGHT. I KNOW.

448
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:06,465
I UNDERSTAND. I'M SORRY.

449
00:16:06,465 --> 00:16:08,842
AND YOU WILL NOT SEE ME AGAIN. 
[bell rings]

450
00:16:14,389 --> 00:16:16,516
STARTING RIGHT NOW.

451
00:16:17,934 --> 00:16:19,769
narrator: GEORGE SR. 
WENT ON A WALK WITH CINDI.

452
00:16:19,769 --> 00:16:20,645
- GEORGE.

453
00:16:20,645 --> 00:16:22,106
narrator: 
AND SHE WAS GETTING TO HIM.

454
00:16:22,106 --> 00:16:25,234
- YOU CAN FEEL SAFE TO FULLY 
REVEAL YOURSELF TO ME.

455
00:16:25,234 --> 00:16:26,318
- HMM, ALL RIGHT.

456
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:28,403
[sighs] 
THERE IS--

457
00:16:28,403 --> 00:16:30,114
THERE IS SOMETHING.

458
00:16:30,114 --> 00:16:32,241
- COME CLOSER.

459
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:36,953
- [sighs] 
IT'S WEIGHING HEAVY ON MY SOUL.

460
00:16:36,953 --> 00:16:40,790
YOU, UH--YOU KNOW, THE TALMUD 
TEACHES US TO--THERE YOU GO.

461
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:41,916
[inhales sharply]

462
00:16:41,916 --> 00:16:43,252
- WHAT'S HE DOING?

463
00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:44,253
- HE'S PINCHING 
THE CAMERA.

464
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:46,338
- HE'S ON TO US. 
HE'S FOUND THE CAMERA.

465
00:16:46,338 --> 00:16:48,423
- GET OUT OF THERE. HE'S GOT 
THE CAMERA. ABORT! ABORT!

466
00:16:48,423 --> 00:16:50,425
- GET THE DOG. CLEAN THE DOG. 
WE ARE CLEANING THE DOG!

467
00:16:59,476 --> 00:17:01,686
- [moaning]

468
00:17:01,686 --> 00:17:04,856
narrator: THAT NIGHT, BUSTER 
CAME HOME TO AN EMPTY APARTMENT.

469
00:17:06,316 --> 00:17:08,527

WITH MOTHER NOW.

470
00:17:08,527 --> 00:17:09,694
narrator: IN FACT,

471
00:17:09,694 --> 00:17:12,572
LUCILLE WAS JUST GIVG ANNYONG 
AND MAEBY A RIDE.

472
00:17:12,572 --> 00:17:15,492
- YOU'RE TRYING TO STEAL 
FROM THE WRONG MAN.

473
00:17:15,492 --> 00:17:18,162
WATCH YOUR BACK, 
MY LITTLE IMMIGRANT FRIEND!

474
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:24,959

DIVERSITY DANCE

WAS IN FULL SWING.

476
00:17:26,753 --> 00:17:28,672
- WHOA, SORRY. 
STUDENTS ONLY.

477
00:17:28,672 --> 00:17:30,215
- OH.

478
00:17:30,215 --> 00:17:31,300
SO YOU'RE NOT LETTING HIM IN

479
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:34,178
BECAUSE HE DOESN'T SHARE YOUR 
PERFECTLY SHAPED NOSE,

480
00:17:34,178 --> 00:17:37,431
YOUR ROUND EYE-SHAPED EYES, 
YOUR STRONG SQUARE JAW.

481
00:17:37,431 --> 00:17:39,974
- THANKS. 
YOU WANNA DANCE?

482
00:17:39,974 --> 00:17:42,519
- YEAH!

483
00:17:42,519 --> 00:17:45,189

SHANNON--

485
00:17:46,731 --> 00:17:47,607

487
00:17:48,692 --> 00:17:50,485
HE HAD CHEATED ON HER 
WITH NAZHGALIA.

488
00:17:50,485 --> 00:17:53,363

SHANNON!

489
00:17:53,363 --> 00:17:54,864
OH, HEY, LISA.

490
00:17:54,864 --> 00:17:56,200
SHANNON!

491
00:17:57,951 --> 00:18:00,370
EXCUSE ME. 
LOOK, I BLEW IT, OKAY?

492
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:01,788
BUT I BOUGHT A YEARBOOK AD 
FROM YOU.

493
00:18:01,788 --> 00:18:03,457
DOESN'T THAT MEAN 
ANYTHING ANYMORE?

494
00:18:03,457 --> 00:18:07,461
- BETH! HEY, HI. 
LISTEN,

I HAD TO SEE YOU.

497
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:12,048
I-I'VE BEEN GIVING THIS 
A LOT OF THOUGHT,

498
00:18:12,048 --> 00:18:13,800
AND-AND I HAVE 
TO DO THE RIGHT THING.

499
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:16,428
- YOU'RE GONNA TELL 
GEORGE MICHAEL THE TRUTH?

500
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:19,013
- OH, THAT'S--THAT'S YOUR 
DEFINITION OF THE RIGHT THING.

501
00:18:19,013 --> 00:18:21,015
I THOUGHT I WAS GONNA MAKE 
A BIG DRAMATIC ENTRANCE

502
00:18:21,015 --> 00:18:22,892
AND TELL YOU 
THAT I WANTED TO SEE YOU. OKAY.

503
00:18:22,892 --> 00:18:24,769
UH, I'LL GET RIGHT ON THAT.

504
00:18:24,769 --> 00:18:26,355
GEORGE MICHAEL!

505
00:18:26,355 --> 00:18:28,815
WHERE ARE YOU? 
GEORGE MICHAEL!

506
00:18:28,815 --> 00:18:29,816
- UNCLE GOB?

507
00:18:29,816 --> 00:18:30,984
- GEORGE MICHAEL.

508
00:18:30,984 --> 00:18:32,736
WHAT ARE YOU DOING 
AT A HIGH SCHOOL DANCE?

509
00:18:32,736 --> 00:18:34,363
- I'M LOOKING FOR YOU.

510
00:18:34,363 --> 00:18:35,364
HOW COULD YOU DO THIS TO ME?

511
00:18:35,364 --> 00:18:36,781
- DO WHAT? 
I'M JUST HERE WITH MY GIRL.

512
00:18:36,781 --> 00:18:38,908
- YEAH, MY ETHICS TEACHER.

513
00:18:38,908 --> 00:18:39,909
- HEY, GEORGE MICHAEL.

514
00:18:39,909 --> 00:18:41,870
- NO, DAD. I'M TAKING CARE 
OF SOMETHING, OKAY?

515
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:43,497
YOU SLEPT 
WITH MY ETHICS TEACHER.

516
00:18:43,497 --> 00:18:45,582
[overlapping chatter] 
- JUST HANG ON A SECOND.

517
00:18:45,582 --> 00:18:46,750
IT WASN'T HIM. 
IT'S ME, OKAY?

518
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:48,127
- WHA--

519
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:49,711
- I'VE BEEN DATING 
YOUR ETHICS TEACHER.

520
00:18:49,711 --> 00:18:51,004
- WOW, MICHAEL.

521
00:18:51,004 --> 00:18:53,006
I'M REALLY TOUCHED THAT 
YOU'D STICK UP FOR ME

522
00:18:53,006 --> 00:18:54,674
AFTER I'VE BEEN 
SO HORRIBLE TO YOU.

523
00:18:54,674 --> 00:18:55,675
- HUH?

524
00:18:55,675 --> 00:18:56,676
- YOU KNOW WHAT?

525
00:18:56,676 --> 00:18:58,470
NOW IT'S TIME 
FOR ME TO DO THE RIGHT THING.

526
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:00,805
I SLEPT WITH THE ETHICS TEACHER. 
I'M SORRY.

527
00:19:00,805 --> 00:19:02,766
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

528
00:19:02,766 --> 00:19:04,309
- LINDSAY TOLD ME 
THAT YOU LIKED HER,

529
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:09,063
AND I'M NOT PROUD OF THIS, 
BUT I [bleep] MRS. WHITEHEAD.

530
00:19:09,063 --> 00:19:11,775
narrator: IN FACT, GOB MISTOOK 
THE CIVICS TEACHER

531
00:19:11,775 --> 00:19:13,777
FOR THE ETHICS TEACHER 
MICHAEL WAS DATING.

532
00:19:13,777 --> 00:19:17,656
- MAN, HE HAS A TYPE.

533
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:20,575
- GOB, MRS. WHITEHEAD 
WAS THE CIVICS TEACHER.

534
00:19:20,575 --> 00:19:21,618
WE BOTH HAD HER.

535
00:19:21,618 --> 00:19:24,329
- YES, WE HAVE. 
AND NOW WE'RE EVEN.

536
00:19:24,329 --> 00:19:25,330
- WHAT A PIG.

537
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:26,498
- TELL ME ABOUT IT.

538
00:19:26,498 --> 00:19:28,792
- NO, YOU! 
YOU'RE THE PIG!

539
00:19:28,792 --> 00:19:29,793
TWO STRIKES. 
YOU ARE OUT.

540
00:19:29,793 --> 00:19:31,711
- LISTEN. SHANNON, PLEASE.

541
00:19:31,711 --> 00:19:32,712
IT WAS A ONE-TIME THING.

542
00:19:32,712 --> 00:19:34,047
I'M NOT GONNA EVEN 
HEAR FROM HER AGAIN!

543
00:19:34,047 --> 00:19:35,048
[ringing] 
ACH!

544
00:19:35,048 --> 00:19:36,383
[ringing continues]

545
00:19:36,383 --> 00:19:39,469
WHO IS EDNA W.? 
HELLO?

546
00:19:39,469 --> 00:19:40,679
[groans]

547
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:41,805
- WHAT'S GOING 
ON HERE, DAD?

548
00:19:41,805 --> 00:19:43,807
- WELL, IT-IT-IT WAS ME, OKAY?

549
00:19:43,807 --> 00:19:45,016
I-I'VE BEEN SEEING MS. BAERLY,

550
00:19:45,016 --> 00:19:46,893
AND I SHOULD NEVER HAVE BROUGHT 
GOB INTO IT.

551
00:19:46,893 --> 00:19:48,687
BUT THAT DAY THAT YOU TOLD ME 
YOU LIKED HER,

552
00:19:48,687 --> 00:19:50,189
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT ELSE TO DO.

553
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:51,190
I NEVER WANTED TO HURT YOU.

554
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:53,317
- WELL, DIDN'T AUNT LINDSAY 
TELL YOU THAT I LIKED HER?

555
00:19:53,317 --> 00:19:54,318
- YEAH, SHE DID.

556
00:19:54,318 --> 00:19:56,027
BUT SHE SAID THAT 
YOU WANTED HER AS A MOTHER,

557
00:19:56,027 --> 00:19:57,404
AND I SAID THAT WAS RIDICULOUS,

558
00:19:57,404 --> 00:19:59,155
BUT THEN I MET HER 
AND KIND OF FELL FOR HER

559
00:19:59,155 --> 00:20:02,326
AND THOUGHT THAT SHE WOULD 
KIND OF MAKE A GREAT MOTHER.

560
00:20:02,326 --> 00:20:03,327
- IS THAT TRUE?

561
00:20:03,327 --> 00:20:05,954
I DIDN'T KNOW 
YOU WERE THAT SERIOUS.

562
00:20:05,954 --> 00:20:07,163
- WELL, YOU KNOW, 
I'M OPEN TO IT.

563
00:20:07,163 --> 00:20:08,498
WE'RE OPEN TO IT.

564
00:20:08,498 --> 00:20:11,042
- WOW!

565
00:20:11,042 --> 00:20:12,043
NO, NO, NO, NO.

566
00:20:12,043 --> 00:20:14,963
- I'M JUST SAYING SOMEDAY, 
YOU KNOW.

567
00:20:14,963 --> 00:20:15,964
- I'M NOT REALLY INTO KIDS.

568
00:20:15,964 --> 00:20:18,467
- I'M JUST--I'M NOT TRYING 
TO RUSH ANYTHING.

569
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:20,635
- HEY! 
THE LADY SAID NO, MAN.

570
00:20:20,635 --> 00:20:23,179
- LOOK, MICHAEL, I HOPE YOU FIND 
WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR.

571
00:20:23,179 --> 00:20:26,266
I MEAN WE HAD SOME LAUGHS 
ABOUT SOME VERY SAD THINGS,

572
00:20:26,266 --> 00:20:30,812
BUT I DON'T THINK 
WE HAVE A FUTURE.

573
00:20:30,812 --> 00:20:32,356
AND, JEREMY, I WILL 
TAKE THAT CUPCAKE.

574
00:20:32,356 --> 00:20:34,441
- OHH. OKAY, UM--

575
00:20:35,567 --> 00:20:38,528
HEY, UH, 
YOU WANNA DANCE?

576
00:20:38,528 --> 00:20:40,113
- SURE, WHY NOT?

577
00:20:43,116 --> 00:20:45,076
- I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT 
WOULD HAVE WORKED.

578
00:20:45,076 --> 00:20:48,121
narrator: ON THE NEXT 
"ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT"...

579
00:20:48,121 --> 00:20:50,374
BUSTER'S COMPETITION 
HEATS UP.

580
00:20:50,374 --> 00:20:51,375
- WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA!

581
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:53,377
WE ARE NOT ALLOWED 
TO HAVE CANDLES IN HERE.

582
00:20:53,377 --> 00:20:54,378
MOM WOULD FREAK.

583
00:20:54,378 --> 00:20:55,920
- OH, NO, IT'S FINE.

584
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:56,921
THIS IS AMERICA, BABY.

585
00:20:56,921 --> 00:20:59,549
YOU PRAY HOW YOU WANT.

586
00:20:59,549 --> 00:21:01,385
- [Buster scoffs]

587
00:21:01,385 --> 00:21:04,053
I'LL LIGHT A CANDLE 
OF MY OWN.

588
00:21:04,053 --> 00:21:06,055
THAT'S EXACTLY 
WHAT I'LL DO.

589
00:21:14,523 --> 00:21:15,690
