male narrator: NOW THE STORY OF 
A WEALTHY FAMILY

2
00:00:03,419 --> 00:00:04,670
WHO LOST EVERYTHING

3
00:00:04,670 --> 00:00:05,921
AND THE ONE SON 
WHO HAD NO CHOICE

4
00:00:05,921 --> 00:00:07,798
BUT TO KEEP THEM ALL TOGETHER.

5
00:00:13,054 --> 00:00:15,473
IT'S "ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT."

6
00:00:17,475 --> 00:00:18,976
- GEORGE MICHAEL?

7
00:00:18,976 --> 00:00:20,811
narrator: MICHAEL WAS LOOKING 
FOR HIS SON,

8
00:00:20,811 --> 00:00:22,897
WITH WHOM HE HAD 
A SECRET TO SHARE.

9
00:00:22,897 --> 00:00:24,149
- THERE YOU ARE. HEY, PAL. 
YOU ALONE?

10
00:00:24,149 --> 00:00:25,650
- ALMOST ALWAYS, YEAH.

11
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:27,818
YOU KNOW, MAEBY'S 
NEVER AROUND ANYMORE,

12
00:00:27,818 --> 00:00:29,195
AND ANN'S OFF WITH HER 
RELIGIOUS GROUP,

13
00:00:29,195 --> 00:00:30,488
TRYING TO GET "NIP/TUCK" 
TAKEN OFF THE AIR.

14
00:00:30,488 --> 00:00:32,073
- THEY DON'T LIKE "NIP/TUCK"?

15
00:00:32,073 --> 00:00:33,616
- WELL, YOU KNOW, 
THEY DON'T LIKE ANYTHING.

16
00:00:33,616 --> 00:00:35,868
SOMETHING ABOUT GOD WANTS PEOPLE 
TO AGE NATURALLY.

17
00:00:35,868 --> 00:00:38,038
I DON'T KNOW. 
IRONICALLY, SHE LIKES GANGY.

18
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:39,997
- LISTEN, YOU KNOW, 
I WOULD NEVER DATE ANYONE

19
00:00:39,997 --> 00:00:42,625
WITHOUT YOU 
BEING OKAY WITH IT, RIGHT?

20
00:00:42,625 --> 00:00:44,085
- YEAH, 
AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO THAT.

21
00:00:44,085 --> 00:00:46,796
- GREAT, BECAUSE I DIDN'T 
DO IT THIS TIME.

22
00:00:46,796 --> 00:00:50,383
I KIND OF RECONNECTED 
WITH THAT BLIND PROSECUTOR

23
00:00:50,383 --> 00:00:51,967
I USED TO DATE, MAGGIE LIZER.

24
00:00:51,967 --> 00:00:53,886
- HER?

25
00:00:53,886 --> 00:00:55,930
DIDN'T SHE TURN OUT 
TO NOT BE BLIND THOUGH?

26
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:57,307
- EXACTLY.

27
00:00:57,307 --> 00:01:00,351
BUT SHE'S FILLED OUT 
A LITTLE BIT.

28
00:01:00,351 --> 00:01:03,020
narrator: MICHAEL HADN'T SEEN 
HER IN 8 1/2 MONTHS,

29
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:05,065
DURING WHICH 
SHE HAD FILLED OUT.

30
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:07,525
- REALLY? 
COULD HAVE SWORN IT WAS A YEAR.

31
00:01:07,525 --> 00:01:12,197
AND IT SEEMS 
AS IF I'M THE FATHER.

32
00:01:12,197 --> 00:01:14,824
- DO YOU KNOW THIS FOR SURE? 
I MEAN, SHE DOES LIE.

33
00:01:14,824 --> 00:01:16,326
SHE MIGHT NOT 
REALLY BE PREGNANT.

34
00:01:16,326 --> 00:01:17,618
- SEE, THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT.

35
00:01:17,618 --> 00:01:19,662
BOY, YOU REALLY ARE MY KID. 
- GOOD.

36
00:01:19,662 --> 00:01:22,290
- APPARENTLY, 
SO IS THIS ONE.

37
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:23,541
narrator: MICHAEL FOUND THIS OUT

38
00:01:23,541 --> 00:01:25,168
AFTER HAVING LINDSAY 
AND TOBIAS

39
00:01:25,168 --> 00:01:28,213
BREAK INTO MAGGIE'S HOUSE 
AND HIDE IN THE BATHROOM

40
00:01:28,213 --> 00:01:30,381
TO COLLECT AND TEST 
HER URINE.

41
00:01:30,381 --> 00:01:32,300
IT WAS THERE THAT THEY 
STUMBLED UPON A FAT SUIT.

42
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:34,885
- THAT'S WHAT IT IS.

43
00:01:34,885 --> 00:01:36,887
narrator: MICHAEL CONFRONTED 
MAGGIE ABOUT THIS.

44
00:01:36,887 --> 00:01:40,850
- OH, YOU'RE SO RIGHT, MICHAEL, 
'CAUSE I'M FAKIN' IT.

45
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:42,101
narrator: 
BUT HE WAS PROVEN WRONG.

46
00:01:42,101 --> 00:01:44,354
- NOT.

47
00:01:44,354 --> 00:01:45,896
- MAYBE IT'LL BE EXCITING, 
YOU KNOW?

48
00:01:45,896 --> 00:01:47,648
BE A BIG BROTHER. IT'LL BE FUN.

49
00:01:47,648 --> 00:01:49,066
- THERE YOU GO. 
IT WOULD BE FUN, WOULDN'T IT?

50
00:01:49,066 --> 00:01:50,318
- BIG BROTHER. ME.

51
00:01:50,318 --> 00:01:51,819
- NOT GONNA HAPPEN THOUGH,

52
00:01:51,819 --> 00:01:53,238
BECAUSE SHE DOESN'T WANT 
ANYTHING TO DO WITH ME.

53
00:01:53,238 --> 00:01:54,614
BUT, LOOK, 
I KNOW YOU'VE BEEN BORED.

54
00:01:54,614 --> 00:01:56,991
YOU AND I ARE GONNA HAVE 
SOME FUN TOGETHER.

55
00:01:56,991 --> 00:01:58,909
MAYBE WE'LL EVEN HAVE 
OURSELVES A LITTLE ADVENTURE.

56
00:01:58,909 --> 00:02:00,661
- YEAH.

57
00:02:00,661 --> 00:02:02,872
- MEANWHILE, I GUESS THIS 
FAMILY'S BIG ENOUGH, HUH?

58
00:02:02,872 --> 00:02:04,540
narrator: IN FACT, 
MICHAEL'S FAMILY

59
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:06,167
HAD JUST GOTTEN 
A LITTLE SMALLER.

60
00:02:06,167 --> 00:02:08,294
- HELLO? 
- [screaming]

61
00:02:08,294 --> 00:02:09,545
- MOM, YOU'VE GOT TO STOP

62
00:02:09,545 --> 00:02:11,256
STARTING CONVERSATIONS 
LIKE THAT.

63
00:02:11,256 --> 00:02:14,925
- SOMETHING HAPPENED TO BUSTER. 
HE LOST PART OF HIS BODY.

64
00:02:14,925 --> 00:02:17,928
I DON'T KNOW WHICH ONE. 
- THE HAND.

65
00:02:17,928 --> 00:02:20,598
- I TOLD HIM TO STAY OUT OF 
THE OCEAN, BUT WE HAD A FIGHT.

66
00:02:20,598 --> 00:02:22,933
WHO REMEMBERS ABOUT WHAT? 
narrator: I DO.

67
00:02:22,933 --> 00:02:26,604
BUSTER HAD DISCOVERED THAT HIS 
UNCLE OSCAR WAS HIS TRUE FATHER.

68
00:02:26,604 --> 00:02:27,855
- YOU LIED TO ME.

69
00:02:27,855 --> 00:02:29,357
- YOU WERE NEVER SUPPOSED 
TO KNOW.

70
00:02:29,357 --> 00:02:31,859
- I'M GOING TO WAR!

71
00:02:31,859 --> 00:02:33,778
narrator: AS AN ACT 
OF DEFIANCE TO LUCILLE,

72
00:02:33,778 --> 00:02:36,406
HE FIRST WENT SWIMMING 
IN THE OCEAN,

73
00:02:36,406 --> 00:02:37,907
WHERE HE WAS ATTACKED 
BY A LOOSE SEAL.

74
00:02:37,907 --> 00:02:39,242
[seal barking]

75
00:02:39,242 --> 00:02:41,118
- IF ONLY 
YOUR FATHER WAS HERE.

76
00:02:41,118 --> 00:02:42,495
OH, THAT GEORGE.

77
00:02:42,495 --> 00:02:45,706
GOD ONLY KNOWS WHERE HE IS. 
- THE CAR!

78
00:02:45,706 --> 00:02:49,835
- UP YOURS, GRANNY! 
- YOU COULDN'T HANDLE IT!

79
00:02:49,835 --> 00:02:52,963
narrator: IN FACT, GEORGE SR. 
HAD SNUCK OUT OF THE ATTIC

80
00:02:52,963 --> 00:02:55,258
AND GONE TO A LOCAL 
FORD DEALERSHIP.

81
00:02:55,258 --> 00:02:57,343
- YEAH, THE BRONCO'S 
BEEN DISCONTINUED.

82
00:02:57,343 --> 00:02:59,762
WE'RE TRYING TO SHED THAT WHOLE 
"FUGITIVE ON THE RUN" THING.

83
00:02:59,762 --> 00:03:02,807
THIS IS THE ESCAPE. 
- WHAT A FUN NAME, HMM?

84
00:03:02,807 --> 00:03:05,184
- MM-HMM. 
- MAY I TEST-DRIVE?

85
00:03:05,184 --> 00:03:07,562
[tires screeching] 
[horn honks]

86
00:03:07,562 --> 00:03:10,773
UP YOURS, GRANNY! 
- YOU COULDN'T HANDLE IT!

87
00:03:10,773 --> 00:03:12,650
narrator: SOON, MICHAEL 
AND GEORGE MICHAEL

88
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:14,360
ARRIVED AT THE HOSPITAL.

89
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,195
- IF SOMETHING HAPPENS 
TO BUSTER, I'LL BE LOST.

90
00:03:16,195 --> 00:03:17,947
- YEAH. EXCUSE ME.

91
00:03:17,947 --> 00:03:19,740
- GEORGE MICHAEL, 
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO BE

92
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:20,991
THE BABY OF THE FAMILY.

93
00:03:20,991 --> 00:03:22,368
- UM, MAEBY'S YOUNGER THAN ME.

94
00:03:22,368 --> 00:03:23,619
- YOU'RE NEVER GOING 
IN THE OCEAN!

95
00:03:23,619 --> 00:03:25,204
NEVER!

96
00:03:25,204 --> 00:03:26,456
- WE'RE HERE TO SEE HIM. 
- YOU'RE MY BABY!

97
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:27,707
I'M NEVER LETTING YOU GO!

98
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:29,292
- PLEASE STAY AWAY FROM MY SON.

99
00:03:29,292 --> 00:03:31,043
- YOU'RE MY BABY NOW! 
NO, HE'S MY BABY!

100
00:03:31,043 --> 00:03:33,045
THE HELL WITH ALL OF YOU. 
I HAVE A MAN.

101
00:03:33,045 --> 00:03:34,297
[gasps]

102
00:03:34,297 --> 00:03:37,467
- EXCUSE ME.

103
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:39,844
ARE YOU THE BLUTHS? 
- NOT DR. WORDSMITH.

104
00:03:39,844 --> 00:03:41,679
HOW'S MY SON? 
HE'S GOING TO BE ALL RIGHT.

105
00:03:41,679 --> 00:03:42,972
- THANK GOD.

106
00:03:42,972 --> 00:03:44,807
- FINALLY SOME 
GOOD NEWS FROM THIS GUY.

107
00:03:44,807 --> 00:03:47,352
- NO OTHER WAY TO TAKE THAT. 
- THAT'S A GREAT ATTITUDE.

108
00:03:47,352 --> 00:03:49,144
I GOTTA TELL YOU, 
IF I WAS GIVEN THIS NEWS,

109
00:03:49,144 --> 00:03:50,980
I DON'T KNOW 
THAT I'D TAKE IT THIS WELL.

110
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:52,982
- BUT YOU SAID 
HE WAS ALL RIGHT.

111
00:03:52,982 --> 00:03:56,652
- YES, HE'S LOST HIS LEFT HAND, 
SO HE'S GOING TO BE "ALL RIGHT."

112
00:03:56,652 --> 00:03:58,738
- YOU SON OF A BITCH! 
I HATE THIS DOCTOR!

113
00:03:58,738 --> 00:04:00,281
- HE'S A VERY LITERAL MAN.

114
00:04:00,281 --> 00:04:03,868
- YES, THAT'S MORE THE WAY 
I WOULD TAKE THE NEWS.

115
00:04:03,868 --> 00:04:05,661
- ACTUALLY, I'M RELIEVED.

116
00:04:05,661 --> 00:04:07,121
I DON'T HAVE TO GO TO ARMY

117
00:04:07,121 --> 00:04:09,206
BECAUSE THE SEAL 
WITH THE BOW TIE ATTACKED ME.

118
00:04:09,206 --> 00:04:10,791
I FEEL LIKE 
I'VE LOST THREE POUNDS.

119
00:04:10,791 --> 00:04:12,627
- SEAL WITH THE BOW TIE?

120
00:04:12,627 --> 00:04:14,837
- YEAH, I THINK THAT'S WHAT 
I SAW BITE ME.

121
00:04:14,837 --> 00:04:17,006
NOW I JUST WISH I COULD REMEMBER 
WHY I WENT IN THE OCEAN.

122
00:04:17,006 --> 00:04:18,883
DID WE FIGHT OR SOMETHING?

123
00:04:18,883 --> 00:04:20,676
- OF COURSE NOT.

124
00:04:20,676 --> 00:04:22,387
ALTHOUGH I ALWAYS HAVE 
WARNED YOU AGAINST THE OCEAN.

125
00:04:22,387 --> 00:04:23,638
SO HAS YOUR FATHER.

126
00:04:23,638 --> 00:04:24,889
- MY FATHER.

127
00:04:24,889 --> 00:04:26,891
[dramatic piano music]

128
00:04:26,891 --> 00:04:28,893
- GEORGE SR. 
YOU NEED MORE JUICE.

129
00:04:28,893 --> 00:04:32,480
WHERE'S THE JUICE? 
GIVE MY SON THE JUICE!

130
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,856
- BUSTER, IT'S OKAY.

131
00:04:33,856 --> 00:04:35,107
DOCTOR SAYS 
YOU'RE GONNA BE FINE.

132
00:04:35,107 --> 00:04:36,484
AND IF THEY CAN FIND THE HAND,

133
00:04:36,484 --> 00:04:37,985
THEY'RE GONNA BE ABLE 
TO REATTACH IT.

134
00:04:37,985 --> 00:04:39,279
YOU KNOW, LIKE A TRANSPLANT. 
- I'M FINE.

135
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:41,071
THIS IS A BLESSING.

136
00:04:41,071 --> 00:04:45,242
AND SPEAKING OF BLESSINGS, 
I HEARD THERE'S GONNA BE A BABY.

137
00:04:45,242 --> 00:04:47,287
[giggling] 
- OH, YEAH, YEAH.

138
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:49,414
BUT DON'T--PLEASE, DON'T WORRY 
ABOUT THAT.

139
00:04:49,414 --> 00:04:51,040
WHAT'S MORE IMPORTANT

140
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,500
IS THAT YOU'RE REALLY DOIN' WELL 
WITH THIS, PAL.

141
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,419
MY HAT IS OFF TO YOU.

142
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:57,380
- AND MY HAND IS OFF TO YOU.

143
00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:00,800
[hysterical laughing] 
- [forced laughing]

144
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,053
NO, NO, I MEANT, DON'T GET 
YOUR HOPES UP ABOUT THAT--

145
00:05:04,053 --> 00:05:07,222
- HAND TRANSPLANT. 
- [forced laugh]

146
00:05:07,222 --> 00:05:08,558
NO, THE, UH, BABY.

147
00:05:08,558 --> 00:05:10,310
THE MOTHER DOESN'T 
WANT ME AROUND.

148
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:12,144
WE KIND OF HAD 
A LITTLE BIT OF A FIGHT.

149
00:05:12,144 --> 00:05:15,648
- YOU OBVIOUSLY CARE ABOUT 
THIS MAGGIE WOMAN, DON'T YOU?

150
00:05:15,648 --> 00:05:17,274
- YES, I DO. OF COURSE I DO.

151
00:05:17,274 --> 00:05:19,819
- I MEAN, A SEAL DIDN'T BITE 
YOUR LINUS OFF, DID IT?

152
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:21,278
- NO, A SEAL DIDN'T BITE 
MY LINUS OFF.

153
00:05:21,278 --> 00:05:23,864
- GOOD. THEN GO TO HER. 
ASK FOR HER HAND.

154
00:05:23,864 --> 00:05:25,115
- YEAH.

155
00:05:25,115 --> 00:05:27,993
AND, UH, MAYBE...

156
00:05:27,993 --> 00:05:30,996
I'LL GET ONE FOR MY BROTHER 
WHILE I'M AT IT.

157
00:05:30,996 --> 00:05:34,917
- YEAH. GET HIM OUT OF HERE. 
- [laughing]

158
00:05:34,917 --> 00:05:37,002
HMM? 
GET HIM OUT OF HERE!

159
00:05:37,002 --> 00:05:38,921
GET THE [bleep] 
OUT OF MY ROOM!

160
00:05:38,921 --> 00:05:41,048
- OH, MY GOD! BUSTER! 
OH, MY GOD!

161
00:05:41,048 --> 00:05:42,508
BUSTER, WHAT'S WRONG? NURSE! 
- [screaming]

162
00:05:42,508 --> 00:05:44,969
narrator: 
SO AT HIS BROTHER'S SUGGESTION,

163
00:05:44,969 --> 00:05:48,556
MICHAEL WENT TO THE COURTHOUSE 
DETERMINED TO WIN MAGGIE BACK.

164
00:05:48,556 --> 00:05:50,182
- HAVE YOU SEEN MAGGIE? 
IT'S KIND OF IMPORTANT.

165
00:05:50,182 --> 00:05:51,434
- OH, YOU JUST MISSED HER.

166
00:05:51,434 --> 00:05:52,810
SHE'S IN THE BAR.

167
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:55,605
WHAT A SPANKING I GAVE HER 
IN COURT TODAY.

168
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:58,065
GO GET 'EM. 
- HE SPANKED ME!

169
00:05:58,065 --> 00:06:00,150
- DID YOU SPANK HER? 
- NO!

170
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:02,111
YOU KNOW, THAT WAITRESS 
SHE'S REPRESENTING

171
00:06:02,111 --> 00:06:03,821
IS SUING MY CLIENT 
FOR MAKING HER FAT.

172
00:06:03,821 --> 00:06:07,617
BUT HERE'S THE THING. 
LORETTA IS NOT FAT.

173
00:06:07,617 --> 00:06:08,993
MAGGIE BOUGHT HER A FAT SUIT,

174
00:06:08,993 --> 00:06:11,746
AND I'VE GOT THE RECEIPT 
TO PROVE IT.

175
00:06:11,746 --> 00:06:13,789
- OF COURSE. 
THAT'S WHAT THE FAT SUIT IS FOR.

176
00:06:13,789 --> 00:06:15,207
WELL, I'VE GOTTA FIND HER. 
I OWE HER AN APOLOGY.

177
00:06:15,207 --> 00:06:16,459
YOU SAID SHE'S AT A BAR?

178
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:17,877
- FRIDAY NIGHT.

179
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:19,128
YOU MIGHT WANT TO TRY 
MISS TEMPLE'S.

180
00:06:19,128 --> 00:06:20,796
TELL HER BARRY SAID--[spanks]

181
00:06:20,796 --> 00:06:22,715
OOH, I DID GOOD TODAY.

182
00:06:22,715 --> 00:06:25,050
narrator: AND MICHAEL CAUGHT UP 
WITH MAGGIE.

183
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:27,094
- YOU KNOW, 
THERE HAVE BEEN LIES, YES.

184
00:06:27,094 --> 00:06:29,430
BUT IT'S NOT LIKE EITHER ONE 
OF US WOULD EVER DO ANYTHING

185
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:30,765
TO HURT THE OTHER PERSON.

186
00:06:30,765 --> 00:06:32,725
HELLO, OFFICERS.

187
00:06:32,725 --> 00:06:36,020
- WELL, THERE'S NO FURTHER SIGN 
OF A BREAK-IN AT YOUR HOUSE.

188
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:37,772
AND SINCE YOU HAVEN'T CALLED 
US BACK,

189
00:06:37,772 --> 00:06:40,190
WE AGAIN LEFT THE NUMBER 
IN CASE THERE'S A PROBLEM.

190
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:41,526
- THANKS, OFFICER TAYLOR.

191
00:06:41,526 --> 00:06:43,152
- JUST NEXT TIME, 
UH, CALL US BACK.

192
00:06:43,152 --> 00:06:45,320
- HEY, THE BREAK-IN? 
I TOLD YOU THAT WAS US.

193
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:49,867
- WELL, MAYBE I DID WANT TO 
HURT YOU, BECAUSE I WAS HURT.

194
00:06:49,867 --> 00:06:51,494
I MEAN, THE ONLY REASON 
YOU'RE HERE

195
00:06:51,494 --> 00:06:54,329
IS OUT OF LOYALTY TO THE BABY.

196
00:06:54,329 --> 00:06:55,748
- IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT THE BABY.

197
00:06:55,748 --> 00:06:57,625
MAGGIE, THERE WAS A REASON 
THAT YOU AND I

198
00:06:57,625 --> 00:06:58,876
GOT TOGETHER 
IN THE FIRST PLACE

199
00:06:58,876 --> 00:07:00,169
WHEN WE MADE THIS BABY, 
OKAY?

200
00:07:00,169 --> 00:07:01,587
THERE'S SOMETHING HERE,

201
00:07:01,587 --> 00:07:05,508
AS LONG AS WE NEVER LIE 
TO EACH OTHER AGAIN.

202
00:07:05,508 --> 00:07:09,011
- WELL, THEN I HAVE TO 
COME CLEAN ABOUT ONE MORE THING.

203
00:07:09,011 --> 00:07:10,763
- OH, NO. 
- YOU'RE NOT THE FATHER.

204
00:07:10,763 --> 00:07:12,557
- COME ON.

205
00:07:12,557 --> 00:07:16,351
- I WENT TO A SPERM BANK, OKAY, 
THE WEEK BEFORE WE EVEN MET.

206
00:07:16,351 --> 00:07:17,937
THE FATHER'S SOME GUY 
FROM HARVARD,

207
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:19,772
BUT THAT'S ALL I KNOW.

208
00:07:19,772 --> 00:07:21,398
- THAT'S GREAT.

209
00:07:21,398 --> 00:07:23,358
HE'S PROBABLY SOME GEEK 
"SIMPSONS" WRITER'S KID.

210
00:07:23,358 --> 00:07:25,945
- I NEVER THOUGHT 
I'D MEET SOMEONE LIKE YOU.

211
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:27,780
- MMM. 
- BUT COME ON.

212
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:30,700
I MEAN, DO YOU STILL 
REALLY WANT ME?

213
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:32,577
ARE YOU REALLY 
THAT GREAT OF A GUY?

214
00:07:32,577 --> 00:07:34,495
narrator: MICHAEL HAD ALWAYS 
THOUGHT OF HIMSELF

215
00:07:34,495 --> 00:07:36,539
AS THAT GREAT A GUY.

216
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:38,541
THE KIND OF GUY WHO COULD 
RAISE SOMEONE ELSE'S BABY.

217
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:41,001
- OF COURSE I AM.

218
00:07:41,001 --> 00:07:43,045
narrator: 
BUT HE WASN'T,

219
00:07:43,045 --> 00:07:44,589
AND HE REGRETTED IT 
THE MOMENT HE SAID IT.

220
00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:45,881
[mouthing words]

221
00:07:49,426 --> 00:07:51,178
THE NEXT DAY, 
THE FAMILY GATHERED

222
00:07:51,178 --> 00:07:53,138
TO WELCOME BUSTER HOME 
FROM THE HOSPITAL.

223
00:07:53,138 --> 00:07:55,516
- HE'S COMING. 
WHAT HE'S WEARING IS TEMPORARY.

224
00:07:55,516 --> 00:07:58,227
PLEASE DON'T COMMENT ON IT 
OR SALUTE HIM

225
00:07:58,227 --> 00:08:00,563
LIKE THAT IDIOT GUARD 
DOWN THERE DID TO HIM.

226
00:08:00,563 --> 00:08:04,024
- WELL, LOOK WHO'S BACK.

227
00:08:04,024 --> 00:08:06,151
LET'S ALL SAY HELLO. 
- HI.

228
00:08:06,151 --> 00:08:09,614
- AND WHILE YOU'RE AT IT, 
LET'S ALL GIVE ME A BIG HAND!

229
00:08:09,614 --> 00:08:12,617
[forced laughter]

230
00:08:14,619 --> 00:08:17,747
- GEORGE MICHAEL, GET YOUR UNCLE 
A BANDAGE FOR HIS FOREHEAD.

231
00:08:17,747 --> 00:08:19,331
- AND WHILE YOU'RE AT IT, 
UH, GET TWO.

232
00:08:19,331 --> 00:08:20,791
- OH, MY GOD!

233
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:22,334
- GUESS THIS MEANS

234
00:08:22,334 --> 00:08:24,128
YOU DON'T WANNA 
PLAY "GOT YOUR NOSE" WITH ME.

235
00:08:24,128 --> 00:08:26,714
- [forced laughing]

236
00:08:26,714 --> 00:08:29,091
- OH, WHAT'S THE MATTER, 
BUSTER?

237
00:08:29,091 --> 00:08:30,676
DID YOU HURT YOURSELF? 
- UH, HI, GOB.

238
00:08:30,676 --> 00:08:32,136
- OH, MY GOD!

239
00:08:32,136 --> 00:08:33,554
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR-- 
HE'S GOT NO HAND!

240
00:08:33,554 --> 00:08:35,681
- BUSTER WENT SWIMMING 
IN THE OCEAN,

241
00:08:35,681 --> 00:08:38,225
AND, ACCORDING TO HIM, A SEAL 
WITH A BOW TIE BIT OFF HIS HAND.

242
00:08:38,225 --> 00:08:40,019
- BOW TIE?

243
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:43,105
- IT'S MERELY THE PLAYFUL 
MUTTERINGS OF THE SHOCK VICTIM.

244
00:08:43,105 --> 00:08:44,982
A SEAL WOULD NEVER PREY 
ON A HUMAN,

245
00:08:44,982 --> 00:08:46,358
UNLESS, OF COURSE,

246
00:08:46,358 --> 00:08:48,110
IT HAD ACQUIRED A TASTE 
FOR MAMMAL BLOOD.

247
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:50,613
narrator: GOB HAD RECENTLY 
DRESSED A SEAL IN A BOW TIE

248
00:08:50,613 --> 00:08:53,198
AND USED HIM IN A MAGIC TRICK.

249
00:08:53,198 --> 00:08:54,742
WHEN IT FAILED, HE RELEASED 
THE SEAL INTO THE OCEAN.

250
00:08:54,742 --> 00:08:55,993
[cat screeches]

251
00:08:55,993 --> 00:08:57,411
- YOU'RE BACK IN THE REAL WORLD.

252
00:08:57,411 --> 00:09:00,080
YOU'RE NOT GONNA 
BE HAND-FED ANYMORE.

253
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,875
HOW THE HELL WOULD A SEAL KNOW 
HOW TO TIE A BOW TIE ANYWAY?

254
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:05,085
I CAN BARELY TIE THE YELLOW 
ONE THAT I WEAR IN MY ACT.

255
00:09:05,085 --> 00:09:07,129
- THIS ONE HAD A YELLOW BOW TIE!

256
00:09:07,129 --> 00:09:08,380
- REALLY?

257
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:09,965
narrator: AND LATER,

258
00:09:09,965 --> 00:09:11,383
LUCILLE COULD NOT CONTAIN 
HER GUILT ANY LONGER.

259
00:09:11,383 --> 00:09:12,968
- I DID THIS.

260
00:09:12,968 --> 00:09:15,888
I PRAYED THAT GOD TAKE ANYTHING 
HE WANTED FROM US

261
00:09:15,888 --> 00:09:17,890
SO THAT BUSTER WOULDN'T 
HAVE TO GO TO WAR.

262
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:19,349
- OH, MOM, 
AFTER ALL THESE YEARS,

263
00:09:19,349 --> 00:09:21,602
GOD'S NOT GONNA TAKE 
A CALL FROM YOU.

264
00:09:21,602 --> 00:09:23,896
- I DID THIS.

265
00:09:23,896 --> 00:09:25,189
I THINK THAT THE SEAL 
WITH THE YELLOW BOW TIE

266
00:09:25,189 --> 00:09:26,440
MIGHT BE THE ONE

267
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,858
THAT I RELEASED INTO THE SEA

268
00:09:27,858 --> 00:09:29,902
AFTER GIVING IT 
THE TASTE FOR MAMMAL BLOOD.

269
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:33,072
- OKAY, YOU'VE GOT A BETTER CASE 
THAN MOM DOES.

270
00:09:33,072 --> 00:09:35,532
- STILL, I COULD 
HUNT DOWN THAT SEAL.

271
00:09:35,532 --> 00:09:37,326
- WELL, THEY SAID IF YOU 
RETRIEVE BUSTER'S HAND,

272
00:09:37,326 --> 00:09:39,203
THEY MIGHT BE ABLE 
TO DO A TRANSPLANT.

273
00:09:39,203 --> 00:09:40,663
- AT THE VERY LEAST, 
I CAN REMOVE

274
00:09:40,663 --> 00:09:43,290
THAT INCRIMINATING BOW TIE.

275
00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:44,917
narrator: AND MICHAEL 
TOLD LINDSAY

276
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:46,210
ABOUT HIS COMMITMENT 
TO MAGGIE

277
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:48,378
AND THE CHILD THAT WASN'T HIS.

278
00:09:48,378 --> 00:09:50,297
- WELL, FIRST OF ALL, 
I'M SURE THERE ARE WRITERS

279
00:09:50,297 --> 00:09:51,841
ON "THE SIMPSONS" 
WHO AREN'T GEEKS.

280
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:53,467
AND SECONDLY, 
I THINK THIS COMMITMENT

281
00:09:53,467 --> 00:09:54,760
YOU'RE MAKING IS GREAT.

282
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,971
- IT IS. 
IT'S GREAT. IT'S GREAT.

283
00:09:56,971 --> 00:09:58,347
I DO THINK SOMETHING 
MIGHT BE UP, THOUGH.

284
00:09:58,347 --> 00:10:00,140
WHAT IF SHE'S STILL LYING?

285
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:02,392
- OH, NO, YOU'RE TRYING 
TO GET OUT OF THIS, AREN'T YOU?

286
00:10:02,392 --> 00:10:04,854
I THOUGHT YOU WERE A GOOD GUY. 
- I AM A GOOD GUY.

287
00:10:04,854 --> 00:10:06,480
- IS HE TRYING TO GET OUT 
OF HAVING THIS BABY?

288
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,023
- WE WANT THIS CHILD.

289
00:10:08,023 --> 00:10:10,567
IT'S GIVEN US A REASON 
TO STAY TOGETHER.

290
00:10:10,567 --> 00:10:13,278
narrator: IN FACT, IT WAS 
INVESTIGATING THE PREGNANCY

291
00:10:13,278 --> 00:10:17,241
THAT HAD REIGNITED 
LINDSAY AND TOBIAS'S PASSION.

292
00:10:17,241 --> 00:10:19,284
IT WAS WEIRD.

293
00:10:19,284 --> 00:10:21,245
- WHERE'S YOUR CHILD? 
- I DON'T HAVE A CHILD, MICHAEL.

294
00:10:21,245 --> 00:10:22,663
- WE DON'T HAVE A CHILD, 
MICHAEL.

295
00:10:22,663 --> 00:10:23,914
- THAT'S WHY WE WANT--

296
00:10:23,914 --> 00:10:25,750
both: OH. 
- DID YOU MEAN MAEBY?

297
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:27,292
- I DID MEAN MAEBY.

298
00:10:27,292 --> 00:10:30,254
- WELL, SHE'S HARDLY A CHILD, 
IS SHE, MICHAEL?

299
00:10:30,254 --> 00:10:31,881
- YEAH. 
AND WE KNOW WHERE SHE IS.

300
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:33,758
SHE'S WITH HER DEBATE CLUB,

301
00:10:33,758 --> 00:10:36,176
AND THEY'RE ON THEIR WAY TO 
SACREMENDE FOR THE SEMIFINALS.

302
00:10:36,176 --> 00:10:38,303
narrator: 
SHE WASN'T.

303
00:10:38,303 --> 00:10:40,222
AND A GOOGLE SEARCH 
OF THE WORD "SACREMENDE"

304
00:10:40,222 --> 00:10:42,516
ONLY CAME UP WITH THIS.

305
00:10:42,516 --> 00:10:44,143
IN FACT, 
SHE WAS OVERSEEING A REMAKE

306
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:47,062
OF "THE OLD MAN AND THE SEA"

307
00:10:47,062 --> 00:10:50,482
FOR THE FILM STUDIO WHERE SHE'D 
BLUFFED HER WAY INTO A JOB.

308
00:10:50,482 --> 00:10:52,526
- WHAT ON EARTH 
IS TAKING SO LONG?

309
00:10:52,526 --> 00:10:55,404
AM I THE ONLY ONE WHO WANTS 
TO GET HOME AND SEE THEIR KIDS?

310
00:10:55,404 --> 00:10:58,073
- SO PLEASE DON'T TELL ME 
I DON'T KNOW WHERE MY KID IS.

311
00:10:58,073 --> 00:10:59,700
- ALL I'M SAYING 
IS THAT MAGGIE CLAIMS

312
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:02,327
THAT NO ONE ELSE IS INVOLVED.

313
00:11:02,327 --> 00:11:03,704
BUT WHAT IF SHE'S LYING AGAIN

314
00:11:03,704 --> 00:11:05,372
AND THERE IS SOMEONE ELSE 
INVOLVED?

315
00:11:05,372 --> 00:11:07,917
YOU KNOW, 
A BOYFRIEND, A HUSBAND.

316
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:11,128
SOMEONE THAT GOT DUMPED WHEN 
SOMETHING BETTER CAME ALONG.

317
00:11:11,128 --> 00:11:12,629
- OF COURSE. WHY WOULDN'T SHE?

318
00:11:12,629 --> 00:11:14,089
- WELL, YEAH, I'M A GOOD GUY, 
YOU KNOW.

319
00:11:14,089 --> 00:11:15,507
SO I'M THINKIN' THAT MAYBE

320
00:11:15,507 --> 00:11:17,134
YOU CAN BREAK INTO HER HOUSE 
AGAIN FOR ME

321
00:11:17,134 --> 00:11:18,886
AND SEE IF YOU CAN 
FIND SOME, UH--

322
00:11:18,886 --> 00:11:20,888
- WAY OUT OF THIS FOR YOU? 
I DON'T THINK SO.

323
00:11:20,888 --> 00:11:22,639
- NO, I WAS GONNA SAY

324
00:11:22,639 --> 00:11:25,726
FIND SOME EVIDENCE OF WHO 
THE FATHER IS, BUT FORGET IT.

325
00:11:25,726 --> 00:11:29,772
I'LL FIND SOMEBODY 
WHO WANTS AN ADVENTURE.

326
00:11:29,772 --> 00:11:31,356
[whispering] GEORGE MICHAEL,

327
00:11:31,356 --> 00:11:33,108
HOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO GET AWAY 
FROM UNCLE BUSTER?

328
00:11:33,108 --> 00:11:35,194
- I'D REALLY LIKE THAT. 
- GOOD. SHH, SHH, SHH.

329
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:36,445
narrator: AND SO, 
WITH HIS SON'S HELP,

330
00:11:36,445 --> 00:11:37,738
MICHAEL WENT TO MAGGIE'S

331
00:11:37,738 --> 00:11:39,114
TO FIND SOME EVIDENCE 
OF ANOTHER MAN.

332
00:11:39,114 --> 00:11:40,365
- IT'S ANOTHER 
BLUTH BOY ADVENTURE.

333
00:11:40,365 --> 00:11:41,700
WE'RE LIKE A TEAM.

334
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:42,952
WE'RE LIKE 
RED MCGIBBON AND BULLET.

335
00:11:42,952 --> 00:11:44,661
- WHO?

336
00:11:44,661 --> 00:11:47,164
- THEY'RE THIS OLD, UH-- 
NEVER MIND. OKAY, LISTEN.

337
00:11:47,164 --> 00:11:48,707
ANYTHING YOU FIND IN THERE-- 
NAME, PHONE NUMBER--

338
00:11:48,707 --> 00:11:50,167
YOU BRING IT OUT TO DADDY, 
ALL RIGHT?

339
00:11:50,167 --> 00:11:51,418
- YOU MEAN YOU'RE NOT 
GOING IN WITH ME?

340
00:11:51,418 --> 00:11:52,753
- HMM? NO.

341
00:11:52,753 --> 00:11:55,255
I CAN'T FIT THROUGH 
THAT DOGGY DOOR.

342
00:11:55,255 --> 00:11:57,674
BUT I AM GONNA RISK BEING 
CAUGHT OUT HERE.

343
00:11:57,674 --> 00:12:00,385
BE CAREFUL.

344
00:12:00,385 --> 00:12:04,098
- OKAY, I GOT A PHONE NUMBER. 
LET'S GO. DRIVE.

345
00:12:04,098 --> 00:12:06,183
LET'S GO. HIT THE GAS. 
- YOU DIDN'T EVEN GO INSIDE.

346
00:12:06,183 --> 00:12:07,559
- IT WAS TAPED TO THE DOOR.

347
00:12:07,559 --> 00:12:09,019
- IT'S PROBABLY 
THE SPARKLETTS GUY.

348
00:12:09,019 --> 00:12:10,687
LISTEN, IT'S OKAY. 
I'M TELLING YOU.

349
00:12:10,687 --> 00:12:12,272
THERE'S NOTHING 
TO BE SCARED ABOUT.

350
00:12:12,272 --> 00:12:14,691
I'M NOT GETTING THAT VIBE. 
HEY!

351
00:12:14,691 --> 00:12:16,777
- EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT? 
- YES, OFFICER.

352
00:12:16,777 --> 00:12:18,028
JUST WAITING TO SEE 
IF MAGGIE'S HOME.

353
00:12:18,028 --> 00:12:19,571
- OH.

354
00:12:19,571 --> 00:12:21,073
I WAS MAKING SURE THERE 
WASN'T ANOTHER BREAK-IN.

355
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:23,325
MY PARTNER IS INSIDE 
WITH HIS GUN DRAWN.

356
00:12:23,325 --> 00:12:26,078
EVERYTHING'S GONNA 
BE JUST FINE.

357
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:33,460
- CLOSE CALL THERE, BULLET. 
I'M SO SORRY ABOUT THAT.

358
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:35,254
BUT LISTEN, I THINK-- 
I THINK THAT YOU DO

WITH THIS PHONE NUMBER.

00:12:37,506 --> 00:12:39,716
"REALLY EAGER 
TO HEAR FROM YOU."

361
00:12:39,716 --> 00:12:41,510
YOU KNOW, THAT'S SOMETHING 
A GUY WOULD SAY

362
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:42,761
IF HE WAS THE FATHER 
OF HER CHILD

363
00:12:42,761 --> 00:12:44,179
AND THE MOTHER STOPPED CALLING

364
00:12:44,179 --> 00:12:45,973
'CAUSE SHE FOUND 
A REALLY GOOD GUY.

365
00:12:45,973 --> 00:12:47,808
I THINK THIS IS HIM. 
I'M GETTIN' THAT VIBE.

00:12:47,808 --> 00:12:49,059
WE'RE HAVIN' SOME FUN, 
AREN'T WE?

367
00:12:49,059 --> 00:12:51,270

RENTED HIS BOAT 
TO BE SHOT IN MAEBY'S FILM.

376
00:13:05,450 --> 00:13:06,869
SO NEITHER HE NOR GOB 
WERE PREPARED...

HERE'S YOUR KITTY CAT. 
AAH! FINE!

00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:20,424
YOU DON'T GET TO BE BAIT!

384
00:13:20,424 --> 00:13:22,467
- WHY ARE THERE CATS 
IN THE SHOT?

385
00:13:22,467 --> 00:13:23,718

386
00:13:23,718 --> 00:13:25,971

narrator: AND MICHAEL 
TRACED THE PHONE NUMBER

390
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:34,771
HE FOUND ON THE NOTE 
TO AN ADDRESS.

391
00:13:34,771 --> 00:13:37,816
- THANK YOU, MR. PARMESAN. 
OKAY.

392
00:13:37,816 --> 00:13:39,359
IN THERE IS THE FATHER 
OF THE CHILD

393
00:13:39,359 --> 00:13:41,778
THAT MAGGIE WANTS ME 
TO HELP HER RAISE.

394
00:13:41,778 --> 00:13:43,238
AND HE PROBABLY DOESN'T KNOW

395
00:13:43,238 --> 00:13:45,115
THAT SHE'S GOT 
ANOTHER MAN INVOLVED.

396
00:13:45,115 --> 00:13:46,450
SO I WANT YOU TO STAY HERE

397
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:48,118

AND, HEY, I'D LIKE TO SEE 
THAT COP OF MAGGIE'S

OH, COME ON. 
IS THIS YOUR PHONE NUMBER?

403
00:14:01,465 --> 00:14:04,093

I LEFT THAT ON MAGGIE'S DOOR.

404
00:14:04,093 --> 00:14:05,344
AND WHY ARE YOU HANGIN'

405
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:06,971
AROUND MAGGIE'S HOUSE, 
ANYWAY?

- I--I'M SORRY. 
I'M IN THIS CRAZY RELATIONSHIP.

407
00:14:09,556 --> 00:14:11,141
SHE WANTS ME TO RAISE THIS CHILD 
WITH HER

408
00:14:11,141 --> 00:14:12,642
BECAUSE THERE'S NO FATHER.

409
00:14:12,642 --> 00:14:14,686
- NO FATHER? 
- I THOUGHT I'D COME HERE--

410
00:14:14,686 --> 00:14:17,272
- THERE'S A FATHER. 
THERE'S TWO FATHERS. DAVID!

411
00:14:17,272 --> 00:14:18,565

KEEP OUR CHILD.

ARE STAKING OUT HER HOUSE.

419
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:38,627
- SHE HASN'T RETURNED OUR CALLS.

420
00:14:38,627 --> 00:14:40,045
THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT HER 
I JUST DON'T TRUST.

421
00:14:40,045 --> 00:14:41,630
- I'LL SAY.

422
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:43,966
SHE SAID SHE DOESN'T KNOW 
WHO THE FATHER IS.

423
00:14:43,966 --> 00:14:45,342
- IN A FUNNY WAY, NEITHER DO WE.

424
00:14:45,342 --> 00:14:47,219

A MIXED COCKTAIL,

TWO PARTS TAYLOR... 
- TWO PARTS CARTER...

426
00:14:49,263 --> 00:14:51,223

WANT TO KNOW

428
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,643
WHICH OF US 
IS THE "REAL" FATHER.

429

430
00:14:59,231 --> 00:15:00,983
I JUST HOPE YOU FIND OUT WHICH 
ONE OF YOU CAN BREAST-FEED.

[chuckles]

432
00:15:02,526 --> 00:15:05,279
- YOU KNOW, 
WE'RE IN A LOVING RELATIONSHIP,

433
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:07,031
AND JUST BECAUSE 
WE DON'T HAVE BREASTS

434
00:15:07,031 --> 00:15:08,657
DOES NOT MEAN 
WE CANNOT NOURISH OUR CHILD.

435
00:15:08,657 --> 00:15:10,575
- I'M SORRY. 
I DIDN'T MEAN TO--

436
00:15:10,575 --> 00:15:12,036
I DON'T WANT YOU GUYS TO WORRY

437

441
00:15:19,501 --> 00:15:22,129

narrator: IN FACT, MICHAEL WAS 
ONE LIE BEHIND HER.

443

444
00:15:29,719 --> 00:15:32,139
BUT ACTUALLY 
A VERY GREEDY WOMAN

00:15:35,392 --> 00:15:37,937
WHAT, DO YOU THINK 
I'M KIDDING, HUH?

447
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:41,023

448
00:15:41,023 --> 00:15:42,524

THIS IS AN OUTRAGE!

449
00:15:42,524 --> 00:15:44,818
- WOW, DID I LOSE THIS ONE.

450
00:15:44,818 --> 00:15:47,321
- MR. ZUCKERKORN, YOU'VE BEEN 
WARNED ABOUT TOUCHING.

451
00:15:47,321 --> 00:15:48,697
- YOU SAID SPANKING.

452
00:15:48,697 --> 00:15:50,282
- I WANT THIS CASE 
THROWN OUT IMMEDIATELY.

453

LORETTA WASN'T OVERWEIGHT...

CARRYING THE CHILD

THAT MAGGIE WAS SUPPOSED TO.

459
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:02,211
YOU SEE, IT WAS LORETTA'S URINE

460
00:16:02,211 --> 00:16:05,714
THAT TOBIAS AND LINDSAY 
ENDED UP TESTING,

461
00:16:05,714 --> 00:16:09,634
A FACT THEY MISSED WHEN THEY 
WERE MAKING OUT IN THE SHOWER.

462
00:16:09,634 --> 00:16:12,596
AND MAGGIE DID BUY THE FAT SUIT 
TO SERVE AS HER PREGNANCY BELLY.

463
00:16:12,596 --> 00:16:14,639
- ALL RIGHT, 
THIS IS GOIN' BACK.

IN THE HOUSE?

467
00:16:23,357 --> 00:16:25,359

MY WATER BROKE TOO!

468
00:16:25,359 --> 00:16:26,986
I'M IN LABOR!

469
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:28,737
narrator: MAGGIE WASN'T,

470
00:16:28,737 --> 00:16:32,366
BUT HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO PRETEND 
TO DELIVER AT THE SAME TIME.

471
00:16:32,366 --> 00:16:35,660
AND GOB CAUGHT UP WITH MAEBY 
AND MADE A CONFESSION.

472
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:37,496
- I THINK I'M RESPONSIBLE 
FOR BUSTER'S HAND.

473
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:39,039
- YEAH, AND I'M RESPONSIBLE 
FOR AN $80 MILLION MOVIE

474
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:40,874
WITHOUT AN ENDING.

475
00:16:40,874 --> 00:16:43,502
- I KNOW THOSE PROBLEMS SEEM BIG 
WHEN YOU'RE A KID, MAEBY.

476
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:46,171
- LOOK, THIS IS KIND OF WEIRD 
ADVICE FOR ME TO BE GIVING,

477
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:48,423
BUT WHY DON'T YOU 
JUST TELL HIM THE TRUTH?

478
00:16:48,423 --> 00:16:50,342
I MEAN, 
HE'LL RESPECT YOU FOR IT.

479
00:16:51,468 --> 00:16:54,096
- THANKS, MAEBY.

480
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:56,890
- OKAY, NOW I'M JUST LYING 
FOR NO REASON.

481
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:01,561
narrator: AND MICHAEL ARRIVED 
AT THE COURTHOUSE

482
00:17:01,561 --> 00:17:02,937
ONLY TO DISCOVER THAT MAGGIE

483
00:17:02,937 --> 00:17:05,899
HAD ALREADY BEEN RUSHED 
TO THE HOSPITAL.

484
00:17:05,899 --> 00:17:07,484
AND BACK AT THE PENTHOUSE,

485
00:17:07,484 --> 00:17:09,861
LUCILLE WAS PRAYING FOR 
THE SECOND TIME IN HER LIFE.

486
00:17:09,861 --> 00:17:12,614
- LORD, LET BUSTER 
FORGET EVERYTHING.

487
00:17:12,614 --> 00:17:16,285
AND IF YOU NEED TO TAKE ANOTHER 
HAND TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN,

488
00:17:16,285 --> 00:17:18,412
PLEASE MAKE IT GOB'S.

489
00:17:18,412 --> 00:17:20,122
narrator: IT WAS AT 
THAT EXACT MOMENT

490
00:17:20,122 --> 00:17:23,458
THAT BUSTER DID FORGET 
HE'D LOST HIS HAND.

491
00:17:23,458 --> 00:17:25,710
- OH! NO, STOP IT! 
STOP IT! STOP IT!

492
00:17:25,710 --> 00:17:28,922
OH, YOU CAUGHT MY TENDON 
IN YOUR CLAW!

493
00:17:28,922 --> 00:17:30,715
- MY CLAW? AW, GOD!

494
00:17:30,715 --> 00:17:33,677
[hysterical whimpering]

495
00:17:33,677 --> 00:17:36,721
I'M A MONSTER!

496
00:17:36,721 --> 00:17:38,765
[screaming]

497
00:17:38,765 --> 00:17:40,016
NO!

498
00:17:40,016 --> 00:17:42,018
[screams]

499
00:17:42,018 --> 00:17:43,853
[bleep]

500
00:17:43,853 --> 00:17:46,815
- WHOSE IDEA WAS 
THE TEMPORARY HAND?

501
00:17:46,815 --> 00:17:49,568
- BUSTER!

502
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:51,820
- HI, THERE'S SOMETHING 
YOU NEED TO KNOW.

503
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:53,363
- THERE'S NOTHING 
HE NEEDS TO KNOW.

504
00:17:53,363 --> 00:17:55,157
TAKE HIS HAND. TAKE IT NOW!

505
00:17:55,157 --> 00:17:57,617
- IT WAS MY FAULT. 
IT WAS MY SEAL.

506
00:17:57,617 --> 00:18:00,204
I RELEASED HIM, 
AND HE BIT OFF YOUR HAND.

507
00:18:00,204 --> 00:18:01,455
WOW. TRUTH FEELS GOOD.

508
00:18:01,455 --> 00:18:02,789
[chuckling]

509
00:18:02,789 --> 00:18:05,375
- YOU DID THIS TO ME? 
- YEAH.

510
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:07,627
narrator: AND GOB WAS 
ABOUT TO EXPERIENCE SOMETHING

511
00:18:07,627 --> 00:18:09,504
THAT DIDN'T FEEL THAT GOOD.

512
00:18:09,504 --> 00:18:11,423
- [screaming] 
- NO, BUSTER! OH!

513
00:18:11,423 --> 00:18:13,092
narrator: MICHAEL, MEANWHILE, 
NOTIFIED THE POLICEMEN

514
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:14,593
THAT MAGGIE WAS IN THE HOSPITAL.

515
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:17,262
- I WILL MEET YOU THERE. 
- WE'RE ON OUR WAY.

516
00:18:17,262 --> 00:18:18,805
- I'M GETTING GOOSEBUMPS.

517
00:18:18,805 --> 00:18:20,182
- HI. OKAY.

518
00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:21,975
I'M GONNA GO IN THERE 
WITH MAGGIE.

519
00:18:21,975 --> 00:18:24,478
AS FAR AS I KNOW, SHE'S ALREADY 
HAD THE KID, OKAY?

520
00:18:24,478 --> 00:18:26,480
WE'RE HAVIN' SOME 
ADVENTURE THOUGH, HUH?

521
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,814
YOU CAN'T SAY 
WE'RE NOT HAVIN' FUN.

522
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:32,819
- DON'T SMOKE, SONNY.

523
00:18:32,819 --> 00:18:34,446
[wheezing cough]

524
00:18:36,865 --> 00:18:39,493
- MICHAEL. 
OH, I'M GLAD YOU'RE HERE.

525
00:18:39,493 --> 00:18:42,454
- IS THIS OUR 
LITTLE BUNDLE OF...

526
00:18:42,454 --> 00:18:44,789
TWO GAY COPS' BABY?

527
00:18:48,293 --> 00:18:51,338
[shushing]

528
00:18:51,338 --> 00:18:52,881
- HERE IT IS. 
THIS CAME FROM OUR CUP.

529
00:18:52,881 --> 00:18:54,591
- THAT FELLOW 
WAS IN OUR CUP ONCE.

530
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:57,802
- HERE'S SOMETHING I THINK 
YOU BOTH NEED TO HAVE.

531
00:18:59,596 --> 00:19:03,267
- BOY, YOU JUST CANNOT GET OFF 
THE BREAST THING, CAN YOU?

532
00:19:03,267 --> 00:19:06,353
- OKAY, WHERE'S THE BABY?

533
00:19:06,353 --> 00:19:07,729
- I'M NOT PREGNANT.

534
00:19:07,729 --> 00:19:09,773
- BUT WE PAID YOU 
TO DO THIS, MAGGIE.

535
00:19:09,773 --> 00:19:11,358
- I KNOW, AND I WANTED TO,

536
00:19:11,358 --> 00:19:13,067
BUT THEN IT TURNS OUT I 
COULDN'T GET PREGNANT.

537
00:19:13,067 --> 00:19:14,444
AND I HAD THIS CLIENT--

538
00:19:14,444 --> 00:19:17,156
YOU KNOW, WE WERE WORKING 
ON THE FAT CASE.

539
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:20,325
SO I-- 
HEY, I OUTSOURCED IT, OKAY?

540
00:19:20,325 --> 00:19:23,245
- AND YOU WEREN'T GONNA LET 
THESE NICE GUYS HAVE A BABY?

541
00:19:23,245 --> 00:19:25,330
YOU WERE GONNA 
HAVE US RAISE IT?

542
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:27,291
- OF COURSE NOT.

543
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:28,750
I'M GONNA GIVE 'EM THEIR BABY.

544
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:30,252
I NEVER THOUGHT YOU'D 
STICK AROUND.

545
00:19:30,252 --> 00:19:32,212
- I'M NOT GOIN' ANYWHERE, 
BABY.

546
00:19:32,212 --> 00:19:34,881
WHAT IS WRONG WITH ME? 
[machine beeping]

547
00:19:34,881 --> 00:19:37,301
- OH! HERE IT COMES! 
HERE COMES THE BABY!

548
00:19:37,301 --> 00:19:39,553
IS THAT THE HEAD?

549
00:19:39,553 --> 00:19:41,180
narrator: LORETTA HAD HER BABY,

550
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:44,098
AND THE NEW FAMILY 
COULDN'T HAVE BEEN HAPPIER.

551
00:19:44,098 --> 00:19:45,642
AND MICHAEL REUNITED 
WITH HIS SON.

552
00:19:45,642 --> 00:19:47,561
- YOU DISAPPOINTED?

553
00:19:47,561 --> 00:19:49,103
- YOU KIDDIN' ME?

554
00:19:49,103 --> 00:19:50,689
YOU'RE THE ONLY SON 
I'VE EVER NEEDED.

555
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:52,274
[bell dings]

556
00:19:52,274 --> 00:19:54,025
- THAT'S ALL THE ADVENTURE 
I'VE EVER NEEDED.

557
00:19:54,025 --> 00:19:55,735
- OKAY, SON, 
I'M GONNA MEET YOU AT THE CAR.

558
00:19:55,735 --> 00:19:58,572
"M." MAIN FLOOR.

559
00:19:58,572 --> 00:20:00,532
NO ADVENTURE THERE.

560
00:20:00,532 --> 00:20:03,452
narrator: BUT "M" DIDN'T STAND 
FOR "MAIN FLOOR."

561
00:20:05,745 --> 00:20:07,664
- DR. WARD TO THE MORGUE, 
PLEASE.

562
00:20:07,664 --> 00:20:08,915
DR. WARD TO THE MORGUE, PLEASE. 
STAT.

563
00:20:08,915 --> 00:20:10,459
[tool whirring]

564
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:13,002
narrator: AND MICHAEL SAID 
GOOD-BYE TO MAGGIE.

565
00:20:13,002 --> 00:20:15,214
- I KNOW. I'VE GOT A PROBLEM. 
- WELL, WE OBVIOUSLY BOTH DO.

566
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:19,968
WE OBVIOUSLY BOTH CRAVE SOME 
CRAZY COMPLICATION IN OUR LIVES.

567
00:20:19,968 --> 00:20:22,929
WHEN WE'RE TOGETHER, 
IT IS LIKE--

568
00:20:22,929 --> 00:20:25,224
- MAGIC? 
- I WAS GONNA SAY "TRAIN WRECK."

569
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:27,934
- WE HAVE TO MAKE A VOW, OKAY? 
THIS IS OVER.

570
00:20:27,934 --> 00:20:32,397
NO MORE LYING. 
NO DECEIT, NO SEX. EVERYTHING.

571
00:20:32,397 --> 00:20:36,192
- NO MORE LIES.

572
00:20:36,192 --> 00:20:39,238
narrator: BUT THAT TOO 
TURNED OUT TO BE A LIE.

573
00:20:54,753 --> 00:20:57,464
ON THE NEXT 
"ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT."

574
00:20:57,464 --> 00:20:59,924
BUSTER AND GOB FIND THEMSELVES 
CLOSER THAN EVER.

575
00:20:59,924 --> 00:21:01,676
- AND THERE YOU ARE.

576
00:21:01,676 --> 00:21:03,512
WE'VE REMOVED THE HOOK, 
AND THERE'S BEEN NO DAMAGE.

577
00:21:03,512 --> 00:21:06,681
- OH, THANK GOD. 
- YEAH, HE'S GONNA BE FINE.

578
00:21:06,681 --> 00:21:10,269
BUT UNFORTUNATELY, YOU'VE STILL 
GOT A HOOK IN YOUR ASS.

579
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:13,021
narrator: AND MAGGIE 
GETS A BIG SURPRISE.

580
00:21:13,021 --> 00:21:16,232
- YOU HAVE GOT 
TO BE KIDDING ME.

581
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:20,111
