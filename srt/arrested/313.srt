00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:04,295
narrator: 
THIS IS MICHAEL BLUTH.

2
00:00:04,295 --> 00:00:06,922
RIGHT NOW HE'S BEING HONORED 
BY HIS FAMILY.

3
00:00:06,922 --> 00:00:08,799
- THREE YEARS AGO 
I MADE A CHOICE

4
00:00:08,799 --> 00:00:10,801
TO KEEP THIS FAMILY TOGETHER.

5
00:00:10,801 --> 00:00:12,345
TODAY, IT LOOKS LIKE 
I SUCCEEDED.

6
00:00:12,345 --> 00:00:14,389
narrator: 
SO WHY IS THIS MAN CRYING?

7
00:00:14,389 --> 00:00:17,517
BECAUSE NOW HE'LL HAVE TO 
STAY WITH THESE PEOPLE

8
00:00:17,517 --> 00:00:19,394
FOR A LONG, LONG TIME.

9
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:23,606
NOW THE STORY OF A WEALTHY 
FAMILY WHO LOST EVERYTHING

10
00:00:23,606 --> 00:00:25,775
AND THE ONE SON 
WHO HAD NO CHOICE

11
00:00:25,775 --> 00:00:27,443
BUT TO KEEP THEM ALL TOGETHER.

12
00:00:33,616 --> 00:00:35,910
IT'S "ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT."

13
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:41,791
DAYS EARLIER, MICHAEL AWOKE 
TO FIND HIS SON IN HIS BED.

14
00:00:41,791 --> 00:00:43,834
- HEY, ARE YOU SCARED 
OF A MONSTER?

15
00:00:43,834 --> 00:00:45,378
- KIND OF.

16
00:00:45,378 --> 00:00:47,213
narrator: IT WAS THE MONSTER 
CALLED LUST,

17
00:00:47,213 --> 00:00:49,757
TO WHICH 
HE'D RECENTLY SUCCUMBED.

18
00:00:49,757 --> 00:00:52,968
- AND THERE'S A CHANCE YOU MIGHT 
NOT EVEN BE RELATED TO US.

19
00:00:52,968 --> 00:00:55,971
narrator: AND ALTHOUGH HE'D ONLY 
GOTTEN TO SECOND BASE,

20
00:00:55,971 --> 00:00:59,850
HE'D GONE IN HEAD FIRST, 
LIKE PETE ROSE.

21
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:01,644
THEN THEY BOTH GOT 
SOME DISTRESSING NEWS.

22
00:01:01,644 --> 00:01:02,895
- AND THERE YOU ARE, MAEBY,

23
00:01:02,895 --> 00:01:04,480
COMING OUT OF YOUR MOTHER'S 
THIRD BASE.

24
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:06,316
YOU GUYS REALLY ARE RELATED.

25
00:01:06,316 --> 00:01:07,358
narrator: AND THAT NIGHT--

26
00:01:07,358 --> 00:01:08,693
- YOU'RE NOT SLEEPING 
IN HERE NOW.

27
00:01:08,693 --> 00:01:10,070
- YEAH, YOU THINK 
THAT'S A BAD IDEA?

28
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:12,488
- WHAT, I MEAN, SO WE CAN 
MAKE OUT EVERY NIGHT?

29
00:01:12,488 --> 00:01:14,449
- DOES THAT NOT WORK 
FOR YOUR SCHEDULE?

30
00:01:14,449 --> 00:01:16,076
I MEAN, I'M SURE 
WE CAN CONTROL OUR--

31
00:01:17,827 --> 00:01:19,287
I'M GONNA GO SLEEP 
WITH MY DAD.

32
00:01:19,287 --> 00:01:20,663
- I'M GONNA GET MY JOB BACK.

33
00:01:20,663 --> 00:01:23,416
- YOU'RE PROBABLY JUST A LITTLE 
ANXIOUS BECAUSE YOUR OLD MAN

34
00:01:23,416 --> 00:01:25,251
IS ABOUT TO START RUNNING 
A SUCCESSFUL COMPANY

35
00:01:25,251 --> 00:01:27,002
FOR A CHANGE.

36
00:01:27,002 --> 00:01:28,921
- SO POP-POP IS DEFINITELY 
INNOCENT, HUH?

37
00:01:28,921 --> 00:01:30,965
- NO, NOT BY A LONG SHOT,

38
00:01:30,965 --> 00:01:32,425
BUT THEY HAVE DROPPED 
ALL THE CHARGES

39
00:01:32,425 --> 00:01:33,509
AND NOT JUST THE IRAQ ONES.

40
00:01:33,509 --> 00:01:36,011
THE EMBEZZLEMENT, 
THE PENSION ROBBING.

41
00:01:36,011 --> 00:01:38,013
I DON'T KNOW WHY THEY DROPPED 
THEM, BUT THEY DID.

42
00:01:38,013 --> 00:01:41,226
LET'S SEE IF WE ARE ON 
"MAD MONEY," HUH?

43
00:01:41,226 --> 00:01:43,311
- AND THEY DELIVER INSULIN 
RIGHT TO MY DOOR.

44
00:01:43,311 --> 00:01:45,020
- IT'S PROBABLY ON 
RIGHT AFTER THIS AD.

45
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:46,689
THIS IS GONNA BE GREAT FOR US.

46
00:01:46,689 --> 00:01:47,940
IT'S GONNA GIVE US A CHANCE

47
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:49,775
TO SPEND SOME TIME TOGETHER, 
YOU KNOW?

48
00:01:49,775 --> 00:01:51,444
IT'S, LIKE, I DON'T EVEN KNOW 
WHAT'S GOING ON

49
00:01:51,444 --> 00:01:52,195
IN YOUR LIFE RIGHT NOW.

50
00:01:52,195 --> 00:01:54,029
ARE THERE ANY GIRLS OR--

51
00:01:54,029 --> 00:01:57,283
- ACTUALLY, I'VE BEEN WRESTLING 
WITH SOME PRETTY TABOO--

52
00:01:57,283 --> 00:01:59,202
- THE BLUTHS. I LOVE THESE GUYS. 
- SHH, HERE IT IS.

53
00:01:59,202 --> 00:02:02,455
- THEY BEAT THE TREASON CHARGES. 
WE HAD IT AS A DON'T BUY.

54
00:02:02,455 --> 00:02:04,957
LET'S BUMP IT UP TO A RISKY.

55
00:02:04,957 --> 00:02:08,043
- RISKY! THERE IT IS, 
WE'RE DOING IT, HUH?

56
00:02:08,043 --> 00:02:08,961
ARE YOU HAPPY?

57
00:02:08,961 --> 00:02:09,962
- I'M REALLY HAPPY.

58
00:02:09,962 --> 00:02:11,881
I WONDER IF WE SHOULD 
MOVE OUT OF TOWN.

59
00:02:11,881 --> 00:02:13,383
- WHAT?

60
00:02:13,383 --> 00:02:14,592
- I FEEL LIKE WE'VE HEARD

61
00:02:14,592 --> 00:02:16,344
THIS WHOLE OUT OF THE WOODS 
THING A LOT, YOU KNOW.

62
00:02:16,344 --> 00:02:17,637
AND I JUST WOULDN'T MIND--

63
00:02:17,637 --> 00:02:19,889
- WHAT HAVE I ALWAYS SAID 
IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING?

64
00:02:19,889 --> 00:02:20,806
- FAMILY.

65
00:02:20,806 --> 00:02:23,559
- I WAS GONNA SAY 
BREAKFAST, BUT--

66
00:02:23,559 --> 00:02:24,977
WHY DON'T WE GO 
OVER TO GANGY'S,

67
00:02:24,977 --> 00:02:25,603
HAVE A LITTLE OF BOTH?

68
00:02:25,603 --> 00:02:29,482
LATER, WE CAN TALK 
ALL THIS OUT, HUH?

69
00:02:29,482 --> 00:02:32,568
- I'VE HEARD THAT 
A COUPLE TIMES TOO.

70
00:02:32,568 --> 00:02:34,279
narrator: 
AND SO THE FAMILY GATHERED

71
00:02:34,279 --> 00:02:37,198
FOR A CELEBRATORY BRUNCH, 
CATERED BY A LOCAL RESTAURANT.

72
00:02:37,198 --> 00:02:38,032
- HELLO.

73
00:02:38,032 --> 00:02:41,494
[chanting] 
- RISKY! RISKY! RISKY!

74
00:02:41,494 --> 00:02:42,620
crunch!

75
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:43,788
- LOOK AT THAT, BUSTER.

76
00:02:43,788 --> 00:02:45,122
YOU WOULD HAVE LOST 
A HAND ANYWAY.

77
00:02:45,122 --> 00:02:46,166
[tapping glass]

78
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:47,708
- I'D LIKE TO MAKE 
AN ANNOUNCEMENT.

79
00:02:47,708 --> 00:02:50,628
WE NEED TO FINISH THE PARTY 
WE STARTED THREE YEARS AGO.

80
00:02:50,628 --> 00:02:54,299
FINALLY NAME MICHAEL C.E.O. 
OF A THRIVING COMPANY.

81
00:02:54,299 --> 00:02:57,343
[all cheering]

82
00:02:57,343 --> 00:02:58,553
WE'LL PROVE TO THE WORLD

83
00:02:58,553 --> 00:03:00,805
THAT NOTHING CAN TEAR APART 
THE BLUTH FAMILY.

84
00:03:00,805 --> 00:03:02,973
IN FACT, I'VE ALREADY RENTED 
THE SAME BOAT.

85
00:03:02,973 --> 00:03:04,725
- OH, I'M NOT COMFORTABLE 
NEAR THE OCEAN

86
00:03:04,725 --> 00:03:05,685
SINCE THE SEAL ATTACK.

87
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:07,228
THE OCEAN IS 
MY SECOND BIGGEST FEAR.

88
00:03:07,228 --> 00:03:08,229
- GOOD, DON'T COME.

89
00:03:08,229 --> 00:03:10,981
I NEED TO BE RUBBING ELBOWS, 
NOT WORKING YOUR FORK.

90
00:03:10,981 --> 00:03:12,149
- WE'LL FIND A NEW VENUE.

91
00:03:12,149 --> 00:03:15,320
- OH, AND BEFORE I FORGET. 
NO MAGIC, GOB.

92
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:17,280
- WHERE IS GOB?

93
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,198
- OH, WHO KNOWS? I DON'T EVEN 
KNOW WHERE HE LIVES.

94
00:03:19,198 --> 00:03:20,408
- HE DOESN'T LIVE AT MICHAEL'S?

95
00:03:20,408 --> 00:03:22,117
- I'VE ALWAYS PICTURED HIM 
IN A LIGHTHOUSE.

96
00:03:22,117 --> 00:03:23,118
- DOESN'T MATTER.

97
00:03:23,118 --> 00:03:25,580
MOM, I'M JUST REALLY FLATTERED 
THAT YOU'RE WILLING TO DO THIS.

98
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:27,373
AND I WAS HALF WORRIED THAT 
YOU'D ALL BE EAGER

99
00:03:27,373 --> 00:03:29,083
TO SELL YOUR SHARES 
AND CASH OUT.

100
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:31,377
- WE CAN DO THAT?

101
00:03:31,377 --> 00:03:34,213
- YEAH, BUT STAN SITWELL'S 
ALWAYS HAD A WILD HAIR

102
00:03:34,213 --> 00:03:35,423
TO BUY THIS BUSINESS.

103
00:03:35,423 --> 00:03:37,300
- IT'S THE ONLY HAIR 
HE'S GOT.

104
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:39,385
WHAT? HE'S AN ALPACA.

105
00:03:39,385 --> 00:03:40,428
- HE HAS ALOPECIA.

106
00:03:40,428 --> 00:03:42,847
LINDSAY, YOU KNOW, IF WE DID 
SELL, IT WOULD ONLY MEAN LIKE,

107
00:03:42,847 --> 00:03:44,265
WHAT, TWO MILLION DOLLARS EACH.

108
00:03:44,265 --> 00:03:47,727
[all chanting] 
TWO MILLION! TWO MILLION!

109
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:49,770
- THAT SOUNDS LIKE A LOT MORE 
THAN IT ACTUALLY IS.

110
00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:51,397
YOU'VE ALREADY SPENT 
$1,200 ON EGGS,

111
00:03:51,397 --> 00:03:53,524
AND THAT 
WOULD BE IT FOREVER.

112
00:03:53,524 --> 00:03:55,276
KEEP IN MIND, 
WE ARE BUILDING SOMETHING

113
00:03:55,276 --> 00:03:56,611
THAT IS NOT ONLY FOR OUR KIDS,

114
00:03:56,611 --> 00:03:58,904
IT'S ALSO FOR GEORGE MICHAEL 
AND MAEBY'S KIDS TOO.

115
00:03:58,904 --> 00:04:00,573
- WE CAN'T HAVE KIDS. 
WHAT'S THE MATTER--

116
00:04:00,573 --> 00:04:01,532
WHAT ARE YOU SAY--

117
00:04:01,532 --> 00:04:02,783
IT'S NOT EVEN 
AN OPTION REALLY.

118
00:04:02,783 --> 00:04:04,244
- WELL, EVENTUALLY 
YOU'LL WANT TO.

119
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:05,745
- SURE, I MAY WANT TO, 
YOU KNOW, NOW.

120
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:07,037
IT DOESN'T MATTER.

121
00:04:07,037 --> 00:04:09,707
EITHER WAY, I WON'T DO 
ANYTHING ABOUT IT. COME ON!

122
00:04:09,707 --> 00:04:11,208
- MICHAEL'S RIGHT. 
AND I, FOR ONE,

123
00:04:11,208 --> 00:04:12,627
WILL NOT GO BACK TO WONDERING

124
00:04:12,627 --> 00:04:15,045
WHETHER THERE'S GOING TO 
BE ENOUGH FOOD ON THE TABLE.

125
00:04:15,045 --> 00:04:16,130
[table creaking]

126
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:17,382
- MIGHT WANNA START WORRYING 
ABOUT THE TABLE.

127
00:04:17,382 --> 00:04:19,174
- IT'S FINE FOR YOU TO SAY, 
"DON'T SELL,"

128
00:04:19,174 --> 00:04:21,552
BUT I'M GONNA BE 40 
IN THREE YEARS, YOU KNOW?

129
00:04:21,552 --> 00:04:22,762
- YOU KNOW, BEING TWINS,

130
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:24,722
OUR BIRTHDAYS ARE PRETTY CLOSE 
TO ONE ANOTHER.

131
00:04:24,722 --> 00:04:26,140
- YEAH, BUT A 40-YEAR-OLD WOMAN

132
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:27,558
HAS AS MUCH CHANCE 
OF GETTING MARRIED

133
00:04:27,558 --> 00:04:29,143
AS SHE DOES OF GETTING 
ATTACKED BY A SHARK.

134
00:04:29,143 --> 00:04:30,395
- [screams]

135
00:04:30,395 --> 00:04:33,022
OH, I'M SORRY, I THOUGHT YOU 
WERE GOING TO SAY SEAL.

136
00:04:33,022 --> 00:04:34,940
- OR A SEAL. 
- OH, GOD!

137
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:36,734
- LINDSAY, YOU HAVE NOTHING 
TO WORRY ABOUT.

138
00:04:36,734 --> 00:04:37,818
YOU'RE A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN.

139
00:04:37,818 --> 00:04:39,320
ANY MAN WOULD BE LUCKY 
TO HAVE YOU.

140
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:41,822
narrator: MICHAEL HAD GIVEN THIS 
SPEECH MANY TIMES TO LINDSAY.

141
00:04:41,822 --> 00:04:43,616
- I'M A GIANT FAT PIG.

142
00:04:43,616 --> 00:04:46,369
- I DON'T KNOW WHY 
YOU SAY STUFF LIKE THAT.

143
00:04:46,369 --> 00:04:48,913
GIRLS JUST GROW 
FASTER THAN BOYS.

144
00:04:48,913 --> 00:04:51,749
- DINNER'S READY. 
WE'RE HAVING LINDSAY CHOPS.

145
00:04:51,749 --> 00:04:53,167
WHAT? I WANT HER TO BE PREPARED

146
00:04:53,167 --> 00:04:56,921
IN CASE SOME BULLY AT SCHOOL 
IS AS CLEVER AS I AM.

147
00:04:56,921 --> 00:04:58,506
narrator: NO BULLY 
EVER WOULD BE.

148
00:04:58,506 --> 00:05:00,425
- OH, LET'S NOT FORGET, 
YOU'RE ALREADY MARRIED.

149
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:01,926
- HEY, MIKEY. 
- YES.

150
00:05:01,926 --> 00:05:03,928
- I THINK I'M GONNA 
CASH OUT MYSELF,

151
00:05:03,928 --> 00:05:06,013
AND MAYBE GO DOWN 
TO MY LITTLE PLACE IN CABO.

152
00:05:06,013 --> 00:05:07,348
- WHAT LITTLE PLACE 
IN CABO, DAD?

153
00:05:07,348 --> 00:05:09,058
DID YOU BUILD YOURSELF 
A LITTLE HIDEOUT

154
00:05:09,058 --> 00:05:10,184
IN CASE YOU NEEDED TO ESCAPE?

155
00:05:10,184 --> 00:05:11,686
- OF COURSE NOT.

156
00:05:11,686 --> 00:05:13,270
- WELL, I DON'T WANT YOU 
TO WORRY, DAD.

157
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:14,939
THERE'S GONNA BE PLENTY 
OF MONEY TO BE MADE

158
00:05:14,939 --> 00:05:16,106
FROM A BUSINESS RUN HONESTLY.

159
00:05:16,106 --> 00:05:19,485
- OH! WELL, YOUR MOM'S 
NOT GONNA ALLOW FOR THAT.

160
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:21,111
SHE'LL DO WHATEVER IT TAKES 
TO GET HER WAY.

161
00:05:21,111 --> 00:05:24,324
YOU THINK THE BANANA STAND 
WAS OUR IDEA?

162
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:25,450
- IT WASN'T?

163
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:26,576
narrator: IT WASN'T.

164
00:05:26,576 --> 00:05:28,453
ALTHOUGH THEY MARKETED 
THE IDEA BETTER,

165
00:05:28,453 --> 00:05:31,205
THE FROZEN BANANA ITSELF 
WAS THE BRAINCHILD

166
00:05:31,205 --> 00:05:33,833
OF A KOREAN IMMIGRANT 
WHO THREATENED TO SUE THEM.

167
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:35,626
- YOUR MOTHER SAID 
SHE'D TAKE CARE OF IT.

168
00:05:35,626 --> 00:05:38,003
THE GUY WAS DEPORTED 
TO KOREA THE NEXT DAY.

169
00:05:38,003 --> 00:05:40,214
narrator: WHERE HIS BUSINESS 
NEVER RECOVERED.

170
00:05:40,214 --> 00:05:42,049
- YOU TRYING TO TELL ME 
THAT ALL YOUR CRIMES,

171
00:05:42,049 --> 00:05:43,926
ALL YOUR DISHONESTY, 
SHE WAS BEHIND IT ALL?

172
00:05:43,926 --> 00:05:45,678
- SHE'S THE QUEEN, MICHAEL.

173
00:05:45,678 --> 00:05:48,013
I WAS HER KING, 
AND NOW IT'S YOU.

174
00:05:48,013 --> 00:05:50,099
SHE MAY APPEAR ALL SWEET 
AND INNOCENT AND LIGHT,

175
00:05:50,099 --> 00:05:53,394
BUT SHE HAS A WAY 
OF CONTROLLING YOUR BEHAVIOR.

176
00:05:53,394 --> 00:05:54,562
I'M CONCERNED ABOUT YOU.

177
00:05:54,562 --> 00:05:55,771
BECAUSE I DO NOT WANT TO SEE--

178
00:05:55,771 --> 00:05:57,147
- HE'LL BE FINE. 
- YOU'LL BE FINE.

179
00:06:03,446 --> 00:06:05,531
narrator: MICHAEL WENT TO CANCEL 
THE RESERVATION

180
00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:08,117
ON THE PARTY BOAT 
BUSTER SO FEARED.

181
00:06:08,117 --> 00:06:09,034
- GOB!

182
00:06:09,034 --> 00:06:10,620
narrator: WHEN HE SAW GOB 
ON A PARTY BOAT OF HIS OWN.

183
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:12,663
- YOU MIGHT WANNA UNTIE 
THESE ROPES FIRST.

184
00:06:12,663 --> 00:06:14,289
- DON'T TELL ME 
HOW TO FLEE, MICHAEL.

185
00:06:14,289 --> 00:06:15,625
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

186
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:16,667
- I KINDA LIVE HERE.

187
00:06:16,667 --> 00:06:19,504
- LIGHTHOUSE WASN'T FAR OFF.

188
00:06:19,504 --> 00:06:21,672
PERHAPS YOU CAN TELL ME 
HOW YOU CAN AFFORD A BOAT.

189
00:06:21,672 --> 00:06:24,091
- YOU MEAN ON THE PALTRY 
1,500 A WEEK YOU GIVE ME?

190
00:06:24,091 --> 00:06:25,175
- I GIVE YOU 500 A WEEK.

191
00:06:25,175 --> 00:06:28,345
- YEAH, WELL, SOMEBODY'S DRAWING 
A LITTLE ONE ON THOSE CHECKS.

192
00:06:28,345 --> 00:06:28,929
NO BIG DEAL.

193
00:06:28,929 --> 00:06:32,099
I WAS PLANNING ON USING MY BLUTH 
COMPANY STOCK TO PAY FOR IT.

194
00:06:32,099 --> 00:06:34,226
SITWELL'S MADE ME 
A PRETTY NICE LITTLE OFFER.

195
00:06:34,226 --> 00:06:35,686
- ABOUT THAT, GOB, 
YOU CANNOT SELL NOW.

196
00:06:35,686 --> 00:06:36,687
- I HAVE TO.

197
00:06:36,687 --> 00:06:38,439
- GOB, YOU'RE GONNA 
BURN THROUGH THIS MONEY

198
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:39,857
AND HAVE NOTHING, ALL RIGHT?

199
00:06:39,857 --> 00:06:41,901
YOU GIVE A MAN A FISH, 
HE'LL EAT FOR A NIGHT.

200
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:43,152
IF YOU TEACH A MAN 
TO FISH--

201
00:06:43,152 --> 00:06:44,236
- HE'LL WANNA USE YOUR YACHT.

202
00:06:44,236 --> 00:06:46,071
AND I DON'T WANT THIS THING 
SMELLING LIKE FISH.

203
00:06:46,071 --> 00:06:47,657
I'M BURNING 
THROUGH MY FUTURE FOR IT.

204
00:06:47,657 --> 00:06:50,117
BUT YOU WOULDN'T UNDERSTAND THAT 
BECAUSE YOU'RE A ROBOT.

205
00:06:50,117 --> 00:06:51,326
ALTHOUGH I DON'T SUPPOSE

206
00:06:51,326 --> 00:06:54,371
YOU'D BE WILLING TO 
HAVE THE COMPANY BUY IT.

207
00:06:54,371 --> 00:06:56,791
- WELL, YOU CAN'T LET GOB 
SELL THOSE SHARES.

208
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:58,876
- WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO? 
HE WON'T GIVE UP THE YACHT.

209
00:06:58,876 --> 00:07:00,461
- OW! OW! OW! 
- KEEP YOUR WEIGHT OFF IT.

210
00:07:00,461 --> 00:07:02,087
- SO LEASE IT TO HIM 
THROUGH THE COMPANY.

211
00:07:02,087 --> 00:07:03,923
- YEAH, THAT JUST 
DOESN'T FEEL RIGHT.

212
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:05,132
- OH, REALLY?

213
00:07:05,132 --> 00:07:07,176
HOW WOULD IT FEEL 
TO LOSE THE COMPANY

214
00:07:07,176 --> 00:07:08,886
TO A MAN WHO HAS LESS HAIR 
ON HIS [bleep]

215
00:07:08,886 --> 00:07:10,763
THAN I HAVE ON MY [bleep].

216
00:07:10,763 --> 00:07:12,557
- IT CAN'T BE WORSE 
THAN HEARING THAT JUST WAS.

217
00:07:12,557 --> 00:07:14,183
- I COULDN'T SEE THROUGH 
THE GLASSES,

218
00:07:14,183 --> 00:07:15,435
AND I SLID 
INTO THE LADDER.

219
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:16,519
- GIVE GOB THE BOAT.

220
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:18,729
WE NEED TO SHOW THE SHAREHOLDERS 
AT THIS PARTY

221
00:07:18,729 --> 00:07:20,690
THAT THE FAMILY IS UNITED.

222
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:24,444
IT'S A VERY SMALL CONCESSION 
TO AN IMPORTANT CAUSE.

223
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:27,822
narrator: AND SO MICHAEL SOLD 
OUT JUST A LITTLE.

224
00:07:27,822 --> 00:07:31,200
- FINE, I WILL GIVE HIM 
THE YACHT.

225
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,952
- HEY, DAD. 
- HEY, PAL.

226
00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:35,204
- WELL, YOU SAID 
WE COULD TALK LATER.

227
00:07:35,204 --> 00:07:37,247
- YEAH. YOU EXCITED 
ABOUT THE PARTY?

228
00:07:37,247 --> 00:07:39,374
- I ACTUALLY MIGHT EVEN JUST 
SKIP THAT.

229
00:07:39,374 --> 00:07:40,793
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

230
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:43,420
THIS PARTY IS ESSENTIAL 
FOR THE STOCKHOLDERS TO SEE.

231
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:46,298
I MEAN, WE GOTTA SHOW THEM 
HOW CLOSE THIS FAMILY REALLY IS.

232
00:07:46,298 --> 00:07:48,258
narrator: THIS WAS AS GOOD 
AN OPENING

233
00:07:48,258 --> 00:07:49,760
AS GEORGE MICHAEL 
WAS GOING TO GET.

234
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:52,262
- MAEBY AND I MADE OUT. 
- SORRY?

235
00:07:52,262 --> 00:07:53,180
- ME TOO.

236
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:56,225
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN, SON? 
YOU KISSED?

237
00:07:56,225 --> 00:07:57,560
- EVEN A LITTLE MORE THAN THAT.

238
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,019
[crowd cheering]

239
00:07:59,019 --> 00:08:01,021
I THOUGHT SHE WASN'T 
MY REAL COUSIN.

240
00:08:01,021 --> 00:08:03,691
BUT THEN UNCLE TOBIAS SHOWED US 
THESE REALLY ROUGH PICTURES

241
00:08:03,691 --> 00:08:06,235
THAT PROVED THAT SHE WAS REALLY 
AUNT LINDSAY'S DAUGHTER.

242
00:08:06,235 --> 00:08:10,114
I JUST FEEL LIKE I CAN'T BE 
AROUND HER OR AUNT LINDSAY.

243
00:08:10,114 --> 00:08:12,157
THEY WERE REALLY 
ROUGH PICTURES.

244
00:08:12,157 --> 00:08:13,868
- NO, I REMEMBER 
THEIR BIRTH ANNOUNCEMENT

245
00:08:13,868 --> 00:08:14,785
LIKE IT WAS YESTERDAY.

246
00:08:14,785 --> 00:08:16,496
[crowd cheering]

247
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:18,581
- I MEAN, I KNOW IT'S WRONG, 
YOU KNOW,

248
00:08:18,581 --> 00:08:21,917
BUT MY FEELINGS ARE REAL, 
EVEN IF IT WAS A MISTAKE.

249
00:08:21,917 --> 00:08:23,503
- WELL, OBVIOUSLY,

250
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:25,963
ACTING ON THOSE FEELINGS 
IS NOT AN OPTION.

251
00:08:25,963 --> 00:08:28,465
SHE'S A BLOOD RELATIVE.

252
00:08:28,465 --> 00:08:31,260
- I KNOW. 
I'VE SEEN THE BLOOD.

253
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:32,970
- HOW LONG HAS THIS 
BEEN GOING ON?

254
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:35,264
- I DON'T KNOW--53 WEEKS?

255
00:08:35,264 --> 00:08:37,892
I CAN'T BE AROUND HER 
WITH THESE FEELINGS ANYMORE,

256
00:08:37,892 --> 00:08:39,935
AND THAT'S WHY I'M NOT 
GOING TO THIS PARTY.

257
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:43,480
narrator: AND SO MICHAEL MADE 
ANOTHER COMPROMISE OF HIS VALUES

258
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,899
FOR THE SAKE OF THE BUSINESS.

259
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:47,777
- WHATEVER HAPPENED TO THAT ANN 
WE WERE BOTH SO CRAZY ABOUT?

260
00:08:47,777 --> 00:08:50,613
YOU KNOW, MAYBE YOU COULD 
BRING HER TO THE PARTY.

261
00:08:50,613 --> 00:08:54,158
YEAH, ANN IS THE GIRL 
FOR US.

262
00:08:54,158 --> 00:08:56,035
narrator: MICHAEL'S SISTER, 
MEANWHILE,

263
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:58,162
WAS DOING SOME 
SELLING OUT OF HER OWN.

264
00:08:58,162 --> 00:08:59,914
- I'M NOT GOING TO SELL 
MY FIVE PERCENT,

265
00:08:59,914 --> 00:09:01,624
EVEN THOUGH 
YOU HAVEN'T MADE AN OFFER.

266
00:09:01,624 --> 00:09:04,251
WHICH WOULD BE HOW MUCH, 
BY THE WAY?

267
00:09:04,251 --> 00:09:05,294
- FIVE PERCENT?

268
00:09:05,294 --> 00:09:08,255
LUCILLE ACTUALLY GAVE YOU LESS 
THAN HER NATURAL CHILDREN.

269
00:09:08,255 --> 00:09:09,506
- I HOPE THAT'S NOT A CRACK

270
00:09:09,506 --> 00:09:12,176
ABOUT MY HAIR COLOR, LIPS, 
FOREHEAD, NOSE, AND TEETH.

271
00:09:12,176 --> 00:09:15,137
BECAUSE AT LEAST I'M NOT WEARING 
A RAYON SWEATER SET ON MY FACE.

272
00:09:15,137 --> 00:09:16,889
- IT'S ALPACA ACTUALLY. 
CRUELTY-FREE.

273
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:18,808
REALLY NARROWS YOUR CHOICES.

274
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:22,853
BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT I MEANT 
WHEN I SAID "NATURAL CHILD."

275
00:09:22,853 --> 00:09:26,106
- WAIT A MINUTE. 
YOU'RE SAYING I'M ADOPTED?

276
00:09:26,106 --> 00:09:27,441
- I'M SORRY. 
I THOUGHT YOU KNEW.

277
00:09:27,441 --> 00:09:28,943
HAVE I UPSET YOU?

278
00:09:28,943 --> 00:09:30,069
- ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

279
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:32,613
THIS IS THE HAPPIEST I'VE BEEN 
SINCE THE DAY I GOT MY NEW NOSE.

280
00:09:32,613 --> 00:09:33,573
I'M NOT A BLUTH.

281
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:35,490
- YOU WERE ALMOST A SITWELL.

282
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:38,869
BUT 37 YEARS AGO, THE BLUTHS 
ADOPTED YOU OUT FROM UNDER US.

283
00:09:38,869 --> 00:09:40,162
SO WE SAID GOOD-BYE 
TO YOU,

284
00:09:40,162 --> 00:09:41,831
OUR DARLING, 
LITTLE THREE-YEAR-OLD.

285
00:09:41,831 --> 00:09:43,165
- UH, WAIT, THREE-YEAR-OLD?

286
00:09:43,165 --> 00:09:46,126
YOU SAID IT WAS 37 YEARS AGO.

287
00:09:46,126 --> 00:09:47,211
- OH, YEAH, RIGHT.

288
00:09:47,211 --> 00:09:49,338
HEY, WE SHOULD DO SOMETHING 
FOR YOUR 40th NEXT WEEK.

289
00:09:49,338 --> 00:09:53,133
narrator: THIS PART OF THE NEWS 
LINDSAY DIDN'T TAKE THAT WELL.

290
00:09:53,133 --> 00:09:55,845
- LET ME [bleep]

291
00:09:55,845 --> 00:09:57,805
GET YOUR [bleep]

292
00:09:57,805 --> 00:10:00,182
- BE GENTLE. 
SHE'S ALMOST 40.

293
00:10:00,182 --> 00:10:03,143
narrator: MAEBY, MEANWHILE, HAD 
RETURNED TO TANTAMOUNT STUDIOS,

294
00:10:03,143 --> 00:10:06,480
WHERE THE WORD WAS 
SHE WAS TO BE REPLACED,

295
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,607
WHEN IT WAS DISCOVERED

296
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:09,524
SHE WAS NOT THE AGE 
SHE CLAIMED TO BE.

297
00:10:09,524 --> 00:10:10,651
- PLEASE DON'T FIRE ME.

298
00:10:10,651 --> 00:10:12,653
- FIRE YOU? 
ARE YOU KIDDING?

299
00:10:12,653 --> 00:10:15,615
I'VE ALREADY GOTTEN 10 REQUESTS 
FOR THE TV RIGHTS TO YOUR STORY.

300
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:18,200
YOU GOTTA GET YOUR FAMILY 
TO SIGN THE RELEASE PAPERS.

301
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,827
THIS IS THE BIGGEST THING 
TO HAPPEN

302
00:10:19,827 --> 00:10:21,787
SINCE UNIPROD 
HIRED THAT WEE-BRAIN

303
00:10:21,787 --> 00:10:23,497
TO RUN DRAMA DEVELOPMENT.

304
00:10:26,541 --> 00:10:28,669
narrator: MICHAEL HAD 
COMPROMISED HIS MORALS

305
00:10:28,669 --> 00:10:30,880
AND WAS HAVING TROUBLE 
SLEEPING.

306
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:34,466
OF COURSE, SOME OF THAT 
WAS LINDSAY.

307
00:10:34,466 --> 00:10:35,425
- ARE YOU DRUNK?

308
00:10:35,425 --> 00:10:37,594
- A LITTLE. 
WE NEED TO TALK.

309
00:10:37,594 --> 00:10:38,638
- YEAH, I'LL SAY.

310
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:39,930
ARE YOU AWARE 
THAT YOUR DAUGHTER

311
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:41,515
AND MY SON 
HAVE BEEN GETTING PHYSICAL?

312
00:10:41,515 --> 00:10:43,726
I MEAN, CAN YOU IMAGINE 
ANYTHING MORE INAPPROPRIATE?

313
00:10:43,726 --> 00:10:45,477
HEY, I GUESS YOU CAN. 
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

314
00:10:45,477 --> 00:10:47,562
- I'M NOT YOUR SISTER.

315
00:10:47,562 --> 00:10:49,189
- WHAT? HEY, LINDSAY. 
- I'M ADOPTED.

316
00:10:49,189 --> 00:10:50,315
AND I'M THREE YEARS OLDER.

317
00:10:50,315 --> 00:10:52,484
- THERE MUST BE SOME MISTAKE. 
- NO, MOM CONFIRMED IT.

318
00:10:52,484 --> 00:10:54,611
AND I KNOW YOU'VE ALWAYS 
FOUND ME ATTRACTIVE.

319
00:10:54,611 --> 00:10:57,572
YOU'VE BEEN TELLING ME THAT 
FOR THE LAST 40 YEARS.

320
00:10:57,572 --> 00:10:59,742
- PLEASE, LINDSAY, 
THIS IS CRAZY.

321
00:10:59,742 --> 00:11:01,911
IF I DON'T GET DIVORCED AND 
REMARRIED IN THE NEXT MONTH,

322
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:04,705
I'M GONNA SELL THOSE SHARES, 
AND I'M GONNA CASH OUT.

323
00:11:04,705 --> 00:11:05,831
SO WHAT DO YOU SAY?

324
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:08,208
narrator: BUT EVEN MICHAEL 
COULDN'T SELL OUT THAT MUCH.

325
00:11:08,208 --> 00:11:10,544
- I'M JUST NOT 
THAT INTO OLDER WOMEN.

326
00:11:13,088 --> 00:11:14,256
- YOU BASTARD!

327
00:11:14,256 --> 00:11:15,215
- AAH!

328
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:20,888
narrator: MICHAEL HAD JUST FOUND 
OUT HIS SISTER WAS ADOPTED.

329
00:11:20,888 --> 00:11:23,348
AND THE NEXT MORNING, 
HE AWOKE TO A WORSE SURPRISE.

330
00:11:23,348 --> 00:11:25,392
- OH, COME ON!

331
00:11:25,392 --> 00:11:27,561
- WELL, I CAN'T SLEEP 
IN THE SAME ROOM AS HER.

332
00:11:27,561 --> 00:11:29,730
SHE WANTS OUT OF 
THIS MARRIAGE, FINE.

333
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:31,648
I'M AFRAID I'M GOING TO HAVE 
TO SELL THE BLUTH SHARES

334
00:11:31,648 --> 00:11:33,275
AND MOVE ON.

335
00:11:33,275 --> 00:11:35,027
- YOU CAN'T DO THAT.

336
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:36,361
- THEY'RE MY SHARES.

337
00:11:36,361 --> 00:11:40,657
- NO, I MEAN, YOU CAN'T 
SPOON ME LIKE THAT.

338
00:11:40,657 --> 00:11:44,036
WE NEED A NEW VENUE 
FOR THE SHAREHOLDERS' PARTY,

339
00:11:44,036 --> 00:11:45,913
AND IT CANNOT BE A BOAT.

340
00:11:45,913 --> 00:11:50,250
NOW, IF YOU CAN FIND SOMETHING, 
MAYBE I CAN FUDGE THE BOOKS.

341
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:51,877
GET YOU A BLUTH COMPANY 
SALARY, HUH?

342
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:53,879
MAYBE CALL YOU 
AN EVENTS COORDINATOR.

343
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:55,339
- CAN WE JUST LAY HERE 
FOR A SECOND

344
00:11:55,339 --> 00:11:56,924
WHILE I THINK ABOUT IT?

345
00:11:56,924 --> 00:11:59,593
narrator: MICHAEL WAS MAKING 
COMPROMISES ALL OVER THE PLACE.

346
00:11:59,593 --> 00:12:00,510
- SURE.

347
00:12:03,513 --> 00:12:05,850
- I'LL DO IT. 
- SOUNDS GREAT.

348
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:06,934
narrator: SOON,

349
00:12:06,934 --> 00:12:09,603
GEORGE MICHAEL WENT TO ANN'S 
TO TRY TO WIN HER BACK.

350
00:12:09,603 --> 00:12:11,313
BUT HER UNCLE PAUL TOLD HIM

351
00:12:11,313 --> 00:12:13,565
THAT ANN HAD MOVED IN 
WITH HER BOYFRIEND.

352
00:12:13,565 --> 00:12:14,649
HE ALSO MENTIONED

353
00:12:14,649 --> 00:12:17,611
THAT WE ALL ONLY HAD 
THREE MORE WEEKS ON EARTH,

354
00:12:17,611 --> 00:12:19,238
AND THAT FOSSILS 
WERE JUST SOMETHING

355
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:21,115
THE JEWS BURIED IN 1924.

356
00:12:21,115 --> 00:12:23,033
AND SO, FEELING THAT 
HE COULDN'T GO HOME,

357
00:12:23,033 --> 00:12:28,580
GEORGE MICHAEL DECIDED TO SEEK 
OUT HIS OWN CREEPY UNCLE.

358
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:30,665
AND MICHAEL CONFRONTED HIS 
MOTHER ABOUT THE ADOPTION.

359
00:12:30,665 --> 00:12:32,209
- LOOK, SHE WAS BETTER OFF 
WITH US.

360
00:12:32,209 --> 00:12:33,794
HE WANTED 
TO CALL HER NELLIE.

361
00:12:33,794 --> 00:12:36,505
- OF COURSE. LINDSAY IS THE 
NELLIE FROM THE PHOTO.

362
00:12:36,505 --> 00:12:38,799
WHY DIDN'T YOU JUST TELL PEOPLE 
THAT SHE WAS ADOPTED?

363
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:40,259
- ADOPTING A CHILD 
WE DIDN'T WANT

364
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:41,676
JUST TO STICK IT 
TO A COMPETITOR?

365
00:12:41,676 --> 00:12:43,720
OH, THAT WOULD 
MAKE US LOOK GREAT.

366
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:44,847
- YOU'RE RIGHT, MOM.

367
00:12:44,847 --> 00:12:46,974
PEOPLE WOULD HAVE TWISTED 
THAT STORY TO MAKE YOU LOOK BAD.

368
00:12:46,974 --> 00:12:48,851
- I DON'T SEE 
WHAT THE BIG DEAL IS.

369
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:51,937
WE LOVED HER JUST AS MUCH 
AS ANY OF YOU NORMAL KIDS.

370
00:12:51,937 --> 00:12:53,647
MORE THAN GOB.

371
00:12:53,647 --> 00:12:56,608
- THE BIG DEAL, MOM, IS THAT THE 
FAMILY IS FALLING APART.

372
00:12:56,608 --> 00:12:59,236
THEY'RE TRYING TO SELL THEIR 
STOCK, AND I CAN'T PROMISE YOU

373
00:12:59,236 --> 00:13:01,530
THAT I CAN KEEP EVERYONE 
TOGETHER UNTIL THE PARTY.

374
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:04,158
- WE'LL PAY THEM OFF.

375
00:13:04,158 --> 00:13:07,077
WE'LL CALL IT 
AN ACCRUED CASH DIVIDEND.

376
00:13:07,077 --> 00:13:08,453
BUT THEY WON'T GET THEIR MONEY

377
00:13:08,453 --> 00:13:10,831
UNTIL THEY SIGN A DOCUMENT 
AT THE PARTY

378
00:13:10,831 --> 00:13:13,167
PROMISING NOT TO SELL 
FOR 10 YEARS.

379
00:13:13,167 --> 00:13:15,210
- SO IT'S EMBEZZLEMENT, 
BRIBERY, AND CONSPIRACY?

380
00:13:15,210 --> 00:13:17,254
- AND A WHOLE LOT 
OF LOVE.

381
00:13:17,254 --> 00:13:19,214
- ALL RIGHT, AND PERJURY.

382
00:13:20,549 --> 00:13:23,510
- OH, MICHAEL. 
- HEY. OH!

383
00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:24,887
- I BOOKED A PERFECT LOCATION

384
00:13:24,887 --> 00:13:27,181
AND SOME WONDERFUL PERFORMERS 
FOR THE PARTY.

385
00:13:27,181 --> 00:13:29,183
WE'RE HAVING IT 
AT THE QUEEN MARY.

386
00:13:29,183 --> 00:13:32,061
- [gasps] QUEEN MARY? 
THAT'S A SHIP.

387
00:13:32,061 --> 00:13:34,813
- OH, NO, NO, NO. IT'S A CHAIN 
OF POPULAR NIGHTCLUBS.

388
00:13:34,813 --> 00:13:37,107
ALTHOUGH I HAVEN'T BEEN 
TO THIS PARTICULAR LOCATION.

389
00:13:37,107 --> 00:13:38,692
IT'S ON THE LONG BEACH HARBOR.

390
00:13:38,692 --> 00:13:39,484
- THAT'S THE SHIP.

391
00:13:39,484 --> 00:13:40,945
- BUSTER, DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

392
00:13:40,945 --> 00:13:42,654
THEY'VE ACTUALLY WELDED IT 
TO THE DOCK.

393
00:13:42,654 --> 00:13:44,698
- ALTHOUGH, PERHAPS 
I SHOULD CALL THE HOT COPS,

394
00:13:44,698 --> 00:13:46,408
AND TELL THEM TO COME UP 
WITH SOMETHING

395
00:13:46,408 --> 00:13:48,118
MORE NAUTICALLY THEMED.

396
00:13:48,118 --> 00:13:51,746
HOT SAILORS. 
BETTER YET, HOT SE--

397
00:13:51,746 --> 00:13:53,999
- I LIKE HOT SAILORS.

398
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:56,251
- MM, ME TOO.

399
00:13:56,251 --> 00:13:57,669
narrator: AND GEORGE MICHAEL

400
00:13:57,669 --> 00:13:59,922
WAS ABOUT TO COME ACROSS 
A HOT SEAMAN OF HIS OWN.

401
00:13:59,922 --> 00:14:01,131
- UNCLE GOB?

402
00:14:01,131 --> 00:14:02,967
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? 
HOW'D YOU FIND ME?

403
00:14:02,967 --> 00:14:04,801
- MY DAD SAID THAT 
YOU WERE LIVING DOWN HERE

404
00:14:04,801 --> 00:14:05,802
WITH YOUR GIRLFRIEND.

405
00:14:05,802 --> 00:14:08,097
- YOU KNOW ABOUT HER?

406
00:14:08,097 --> 00:14:09,681
- WHO? 
- ANN.

407
00:14:13,227 --> 00:14:14,103
- HER?

408
00:14:14,103 --> 00:14:15,812
- narrator: 
GOB HAD BEEN DATING ANN

409
00:14:15,812 --> 00:14:19,316
SINCE HE AWARDED HER THIRD PLACE 
IN AN INNER BEAUTY PAGEANT.

410
00:14:19,316 --> 00:14:20,775
SINCE THEN, ANN AND HER FRIENDS

411
00:14:20,775 --> 00:14:25,155
TRIED TO TEACH GOB 
ABOUT THE HOLY TRINITY.

412
00:14:25,155 --> 00:14:27,199
- WHAT? I THOUGHT THAT'S WHAT 
ALL YOU GUYS LIVED FOR.

413
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:29,743
narrator: WHILE GOB DEBASED 
EVERYTHING THEY BELIEVED IN.

414
00:14:29,743 --> 00:14:31,120
- WHAT ABOUT YOU, YOU GAME?

415
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,122
- IT'S REALLY NOT THAT BIG 
OF A DEAL, GEORGE MICHAEL.

416
00:14:33,122 --> 00:14:34,039
I'M 18 NOW.

417
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:36,125
AND BESIDES WE REALLY HAVEN'T 
EVEN DONE ANYTHING.

418
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:37,292
- PRACTICALLY NOTHING.

419
00:14:37,292 --> 00:14:38,585
[crowd cheering]

420
00:14:38,585 --> 00:14:39,794
BUT WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?

421
00:14:39,794 --> 00:14:41,130
THE GIRL OBVIOUSLY NEEDS A MAN.

422
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:43,257
narrator: AND THAT'S WHEN 
GEORGE MICHAEL BECAME ONE.

423
00:14:44,758 --> 00:14:45,550
ANN WAS UPSET.

424
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:48,345
- [screaming]

425
00:14:48,345 --> 00:14:49,804
narrator: AS WAS BUSTER

426
00:14:49,804 --> 00:14:52,307
WHEN HE SAW THE SHIP 
WHERE THE PARTY WAS TO BE HELD.

427
00:14:52,307 --> 00:14:55,185
- [screaming]

428
00:14:55,185 --> 00:14:58,813
narrator: AND SO MICHAEL 
ACCEPTED HIS CONGRATULATIONS,

429
00:14:58,813 --> 00:15:01,275
ALL THE WHILE 
LOOKING FOR HIS SON.

430
00:15:01,275 --> 00:15:03,986
AND BUSTER WAS APPROACHED 
BY HIS LOVING FATHER.

431
00:15:03,986 --> 00:15:05,445
DO YOU THINK THERE'S ANY CHANCE

432
00:15:05,445 --> 00:15:06,780
THIS SHIP COULD BREAK AWAY 
FROM THE DOCK?

433
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:08,991
- WE'RE ON A SHIP? 
- AH--

434
00:15:08,991 --> 00:15:11,285
narrator: AND MAEBY WAS TRYING 
TO GET THE FAMILY TO SIGN AWAY

435
00:15:11,285 --> 00:15:13,412
THE TV RIGHTS 
TO THEIR LIFE STORIES.

436
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:15,789
- TV IS NOT AS GOOD AS IT USED 
TO BE, HUH, UNCLE BUSTER?

437
00:15:15,789 --> 00:15:16,957
BUT YOU COULD HELP ME OUT

438
00:15:16,957 --> 00:15:18,875
BY SIGNING MY PETITION 
TO MAKE IT BETTER.

439
00:15:18,875 --> 00:15:21,253
- OH, I KIND OF LIKE 
"SKATING WITH CELEBRITIES."

440
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:22,254
EXCUSE ME.

441
00:15:22,254 --> 00:15:23,880
narrator: LUCILLE WAS 
TRYING TO GET SIGNATURES TOO.

442
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:25,925
- SIGN HERE THAT YOU WON'T SELL.

443
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:27,968
- OH, I DON'T NEED 
TO SELL, LUCILLE,

444
00:15:27,968 --> 00:15:29,761
BECAUSE NOW I KNOW 
THAT WE'RE NOT RELATED,

445
00:15:29,761 --> 00:15:30,637
I'M GOING TO MARRY MICHAEL.

446
00:15:30,637 --> 00:15:32,681
- I ALWAYS SAW HIM 
WITH A YOUNGER GIRL.

447
00:15:32,681 --> 00:15:34,975
narrator: 
AND GOB, ANGRY AT MICHAEL

448
00:15:34,975 --> 00:15:36,351
FOR SENDING HIS SON 
TO THE DOCKS--

449
00:15:36,351 --> 00:15:38,312
- NOT RELATED?

450
00:15:38,312 --> 00:15:42,149
narrator: WENT INTO A KIND OF 
KNEE-JERK REVENGE MODE.

451
00:15:42,149 --> 00:15:46,611
- WHY GO FOR THE BEST 
WHEN YOU CAN GO FOR THE REST

452
00:15:46,611 --> 00:15:50,699
OF YOUR LIFE 
WITH A YOUNGER MAN?

453
00:15:50,699 --> 00:15:53,118
KITTY LIKES TO SCRATCH.

454
00:15:54,161 --> 00:15:56,705
OH, GOD! MOM! MOM!

455
00:15:56,705 --> 00:15:58,623
[laughing]

456
00:15:58,623 --> 00:16:02,002
- TAKE THESE FORMS 
TO EVERYONE IN THE FAMILY

457
00:16:02,002 --> 00:16:05,089
AND PROMISE THEM A HUNDRED GRAND 
IF THEY SIGN.

458
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:07,424
narrator: THAT'S HOW MAEBY 
FOUND A WAY TO GET SIGNATURES

459
00:16:07,424 --> 00:16:08,883
ON HER RELEASE FORMS.

460
00:16:08,883 --> 00:16:11,178
- WELL, THAT WAS A FREEBIE.

461
00:16:11,178 --> 00:16:14,806
narrator: AND SOON, THE CROWD 
GATHERED TO HEAR MICHAEL.

462
00:16:14,806 --> 00:16:18,560
- I JUST WANNA SAY HOW MUCH THIS 
FAMILY REALLY MEANS TO ME.

463
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:21,188
MY FATHER HAS ALWAYS 
BEEN THERE FOR ME.

464
00:16:21,188 --> 00:16:22,106
- HE'S A GREAT MAN.

465
00:16:22,106 --> 00:16:24,233
[all laughing]

466
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:27,194
- MY BROTHER GOB, WHO I KNOW 
WOULD NEVER DO ANYTHING

467
00:16:27,194 --> 00:16:29,238
TO HURT ANYONE 
IN THIS FAMILY.

468
00:16:29,238 --> 00:16:31,531
narrator: EXCEPT FOR DATING 
HIS NEPHEW'S GIRLFRIEND

469
00:16:31,531 --> 00:16:34,243
AND HITTING ON 
HIS ADOPTED SISTER.

470
00:16:34,243 --> 00:16:37,662
- BUSTER, WHO FACED HIS BIGGEST 
FEAR TO BE HERE TODAY--

471
00:16:37,662 --> 00:16:38,663
- SECOND BIGGEST.

472
00:16:38,663 --> 00:16:40,790
- AND MY SISTER, LINDSAY.

473
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:41,916
YES, SHE IS MY SISTER,

474
00:16:41,916 --> 00:16:45,379
NO MATTER WHAT ANY PIECE 
OF PAPER SAYS.

475
00:16:45,379 --> 00:16:48,048
LINDSAY AND HER HUSBAND, 
TOBIAS, YOU KNOW,

476
00:16:48,048 --> 00:16:51,968
DEEP DOWN, THEY BOTH LOVE 
EACH OTHER VERY, VERY MUCH.

477
00:16:51,968 --> 00:16:56,890
MOST OF ALL, MY MOTHER, 
WHO HAS ALWAYS BELIEVED IN ME.

478
00:16:56,890 --> 00:16:59,101
THREE YEARS AGO 
I MADE A CHOICE--

479
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:03,022
[clears throat]

480
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:06,608
I MADE A CHOICE 
TO KEEP THIS FAMILY TOGETHER--

481
00:17:06,608 --> 00:17:10,195
narrator: AND THAT'S WHEN 
MICHAEL FINALLY CRIED.

482
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:12,489
- TODAY, IT LOOKS LIKE 
I SUCCEEDED.

483
00:17:14,366 --> 00:17:16,326
narrator: 
IT WASN'T EXACTLY A TURN-ON.

484
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:22,582
[applause]

485
00:17:22,582 --> 00:17:24,418
- WHOO [bleep] BABY.

486
00:17:24,418 --> 00:17:26,920
- LOOKS LIKE GEORGE MICHAEL 
GOT HIS MOM BACK TODAY, HUH?

487
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:29,089
- YEAH, WELL, WHERE IS 
GEORGE MICHAEL, BY THE WAY?

488
00:17:29,089 --> 00:17:31,466
- HE CAME BY THE YACHT. 
GAVE ME THIS SHINER.

489
00:17:31,466 --> 00:17:32,551
- HE HIT YOU? 
WHAT FOR?

490
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:33,552
- YOU KNOW TEENAGERS.

491
00:17:33,552 --> 00:17:35,804
PROBABLY LASHING OUT AT YOU 
BECAUSE OF WHO I'M DATING.

492
00:17:35,804 --> 00:17:37,597
- WHO ARE YOU DATING? 
- ANN.

493
00:17:37,597 --> 00:17:38,557
- HER?

494
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:40,475
- DON'T WORRY. 
I DIDN'T FIGHT BACK OR ANYTHING.

495
00:17:40,475 --> 00:17:41,893
I WAS, LIKE, 
"OH, NO, TAKE THE YACHT.

496
00:17:41,893 --> 00:17:42,769
PLEASE DON'T HURT ME."

497
00:17:42,769 --> 00:17:44,521
JUST BUILD UP 
THE LITTLE GUY'S SELF-ESTEEM.

498
00:17:44,521 --> 00:17:45,980
- THE YACHT?

499
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:47,149
OH, FOR GOD'S SAKE, GOB.

500
00:17:47,149 --> 00:17:49,276
I GOTTA GET OFF THIS SHIP.

501
00:17:49,276 --> 00:17:51,153
MOM, GEORGE MICHAEL 
TOOK OFF IN GOB'S YACHT.

502
00:17:51,153 --> 00:17:52,196
I GOTTA GO FIND HIM.

503
00:17:52,196 --> 00:17:53,405
- WELL, YOU CAN'T GO NOW.

504
00:17:53,405 --> 00:17:55,532
THAT'S NOT GOING TO LOOK GOOD 
IN FRONT OF THE INVESTORS.

505
00:17:55,532 --> 00:17:56,741
- MOM, THIS IS IMPORTANT, OKAY?

506
00:17:56,741 --> 00:17:57,659
- MICHAEL!

507
00:17:57,659 --> 00:17:59,119
THIS COMPANY 
IS IMPORTANT.

508
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:01,663
narrator: IT WAS AT THAT MOMENT 
THAT MICHAEL REALIZED

509
00:18:01,663 --> 00:18:05,125
HOW MUCH HE'D SOLD OUT.

510
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:06,960
- NEVER SEEN A C.E.O. 
CRY LIKE THAT BEFORE,

511
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,129
EXCEPT AT HIS SENTENCING.

512
00:18:09,129 --> 00:18:10,714
THAT'S WHO YOU'RE 
PUTTING IN CHARGE?

513
00:18:10,714 --> 00:18:13,883
- I'VE MADE A HUGE MISTAKE.

514
00:18:13,883 --> 00:18:16,928
WILL YOU TAKE THE COMPANY 
FOR 20% ABOVE MARKET?

515
00:18:16,928 --> 00:18:18,197
- TEN, AND I'LL TAKE THE COMPANY 
OFF YOUR HANDS RIGHT NOW.

516
00:18:18,197 --> 00:18:21,100
- FIFTEEN AND I'LL 
THROW IN NELLIE.

517
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,809
- SHE'S 40. 
- TWELVE.

518
00:18:22,809 --> 00:18:25,437
narrator: MEANWHILE, MICHAEL 
SEARCHED THE HARBOR

519
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:28,857
AND SPOTTED THE YACHT.

520
00:18:28,857 --> 00:18:31,151
AND GOB NOTICED 
SOMETHING TOO.

521
00:18:33,945 --> 00:18:36,406
- ARE THOSE POLICE BOATS?

522
00:18:36,406 --> 00:18:37,741
- OH, MY GOD, 
IT'S THE S.E.C.

523
00:18:37,741 --> 00:18:38,992
- THEY STILL HAVE BOATS?

524
00:18:38,992 --> 00:18:40,034
- PREPARE TO BE BOARDED.

525
00:18:40,034 --> 00:18:41,953
- DID YOU DO THIS?

526
00:18:41,953 --> 00:18:43,747
- NO. BUT I CAN'T HELP BUT ENJOY 
THE IRONY

527
00:18:43,747 --> 00:18:45,957
THAT YOU MIGHT BE 
LOSING THREE YEARS OF YOUR LIFE.

528
00:18:45,957 --> 00:18:50,295
- AH, THIS IS WHY THEY DROPPED 
THOSE OTHER CHARGES.

529
00:18:50,295 --> 00:18:51,838
YOU GAVE ME UP, GEORGE.

530
00:18:51,838 --> 00:18:53,382
- GEORGE? I'M NOT GEORGE.

531
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:55,842
GEORGE INVITED ME. 
OH, STUPID.

532
00:18:55,842 --> 00:18:57,427
OSCAR, WHEN ARE YOU GOING TO 
LEARN

533
00:18:57,427 --> 00:18:59,763
THERE'S NO SUCH THING 
AS FREE SHRIMP?

534
00:18:59,763 --> 00:19:02,766
- WELL, I KNOW IT WAS SOMEONE 
IN THIS FAMILY.

535
00:19:02,766 --> 00:19:05,018
- OR SOMEONE WHO USED TO BE.

536
00:19:06,561 --> 00:19:07,562
- ANNYONG?

537
00:19:08,438 --> 00:19:09,981
- ANNYONG?

538
00:19:09,981 --> 00:19:12,651
- BUT MY REAL NAME IS...HELLO.

539
00:19:12,651 --> 00:19:13,568
- HELLO?

540
00:19:14,569 --> 00:19:16,112
- WHAT THE HELL 
DID YOU DO THIS FOR?

541
00:19:16,112 --> 00:19:18,948
- BECAUSE MY GRANDFATHER 
VOWED ONE DAY

542
00:19:18,948 --> 00:19:21,826
HE WOULD GET EVEN FOR BANANA 
STAND YOU STOLE FROM HIM.

543
00:19:21,826 --> 00:19:22,994
narrator: IT WAS TRUE.

544
00:19:22,994 --> 00:19:25,205
HELLO HAD GATHERED 
INFORMATION AGAINST LUCILLE...

545
00:19:25,205 --> 00:19:28,958
TO AVENGE HIS GRANDFATHER.

546
00:19:28,958 --> 00:19:31,336
- HEY, MAEBY EVER MENTION 
MY NAME?

547
00:19:31,336 --> 00:19:33,797
narrator: BUT LUCILLE WAS NOT 
GOING PEACEFULLY.

548
00:19:33,797 --> 00:19:36,007
- YOU BOYS KNOW HOW 
TO SHOVEL COAL?

549
00:19:36,007 --> 00:19:37,676
narrator: I DON'T EVEN 
WANNA TELL YOU

550
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:39,553
WHAT THESE GUYS 
THOUGHT THAT MEANT.

551
00:19:39,553 --> 00:19:42,181
AND MICHAEL CAUGHT UP 
WITH HIS SON.

552
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:44,474
- GEORGE MICHAEL, 
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

553
00:19:44,474 --> 00:19:45,517
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

554
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:46,518
- I CAN'T STAY HERE.

555
00:19:46,518 --> 00:19:47,561
ANN'S MOVED ON.

556
00:19:47,561 --> 00:19:48,645
MAEBY'S MY COUSIN.

557
00:19:48,645 --> 00:19:50,939
WE BOTH KNOW 
THAT'S NOT AN OPTION.

558
00:19:50,939 --> 00:19:54,401
- BUDDY, MAEBY 
IS NOT YOUR COUSIN.

559
00:19:54,401 --> 00:19:55,319
- WHAT?

560
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:57,821
- YEAH, I FOUND OUT 
A COUPLE DAYS AGO.

561
00:19:57,821 --> 00:20:00,156
AUNT LINDSAY 
WAS ADOPTED.

562
00:20:00,156 --> 00:20:02,701
- WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME THIS?

563
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:05,454
- BECAUSE YOU CAN'T BE 
WITH MAEBY. YOU'RE 15.

564
00:20:05,454 --> 00:20:06,580
AND SO INEVITABLY,

565
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:08,290
THE RELATIONSHIP 
IS GONNA FALL APART,

566
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:09,165
AND THEN WHAT DO YOU DO?

567
00:20:09,165 --> 00:20:10,667
SHE MIGHT NOT BE 
A BLOOD RELATIVE,

568
00:20:10,667 --> 00:20:13,002
BUT SHE IS STILL FAMILY,

569
00:20:13,002 --> 00:20:15,505
AND THAT'S A BOND 
THAT LASTS FOREVER.

570
00:20:15,505 --> 00:20:17,090
YOU DON'T WANNA 
ROCK THAT BOAT.

571
00:20:18,383 --> 00:20:19,509
WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?

572
00:20:19,509 --> 00:20:21,052
narrator: 
IT WAS HIS MOTHER,

573
00:20:21,052 --> 00:20:24,306
WHO MOMENTS EARLIER HAD TAKEN 
CONTROL OF ANOTHER QUEEN.

574
00:20:24,306 --> 00:20:26,516
- FULL STEAM, BOYS!

575
00:20:26,516 --> 00:20:27,601
- THIS IS DEGRADING.

576
00:20:27,601 --> 00:20:29,353
I THOUGHT WE WERE GONNA STRIP.

577
00:20:29,353 --> 00:20:30,019
- MOTHER!

578
00:20:30,019 --> 00:20:32,564
[clanging]

579
00:20:32,564 --> 00:20:33,523
- [whimpering]

580
00:20:33,523 --> 00:20:34,941
[ship's horn sounds]

581
00:20:34,941 --> 00:20:36,776
IT'S MOVING! 
OH, MY GOD!

582
00:20:36,776 --> 00:20:38,695
[screams]

583
00:20:38,695 --> 00:20:41,906
narrator: AND BUSTER FACED 
HIS SECOND BIGGEST FEAR.

584
00:20:41,906 --> 00:20:43,199
- I CAN'T SWIM! I CAN'T SWIM!

585
00:20:43,199 --> 00:20:45,619
narrator: 
AND THEN HIS FIRST.

586
00:20:45,619 --> 00:20:47,746
[seal barking]

587
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:49,456
- OH, COME ON!

588
00:20:49,456 --> 00:20:50,999
narrator: 
AND THE TWO GRAND LADIES

589
00:20:50,999 --> 00:20:52,376
MADE THEIR ESCAPE TOGETHER.

590
00:20:52,376 --> 00:20:54,878
- LUCILLE BLUTH, 
PLEASE PULL OVER

591
00:20:54,878 --> 00:20:56,880
AND STEP AWAY 
FROM THE HISTORIC SHIP.

592
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,590
- GANGY'S TRYING 
TO MAKE A BREAK FOR IT.

593
00:20:58,590 --> 00:20:59,883
- WELL, I GUESS 
WE SHOULD GO BACK.

594
00:20:59,883 --> 00:21:01,468
FAMILY STICKS TOGETHER, HUH?

595
00:21:01,468 --> 00:21:03,553
- YEAH, 
ON THE OTHER HAND,

596
00:21:03,553 --> 00:21:06,055
WE DO HAVE A FULL TANK OF GAS, 
A HOUSE IN CABO,

597
00:21:06,055 --> 00:21:08,099
AND 500 GRAND 
IN CASHIER'S CHECKS.

598
00:21:08,099 --> 00:21:12,186
WHAT SAY WE GIVE THEM 
NO CHOICE

599
00:21:12,186 --> 00:21:17,066
BUT TO KEEP THEMSELVES 
ALL TOGETHER FOR A WHILE?

600
00:21:17,066 --> 00:21:19,861
narrator: 
IT WAS "ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT."

601
00:21:21,195 --> 00:21:23,865
ON THE EPILOGUE.

602
00:21:23,865 --> 00:21:27,327
MICHAEL WAKES UP 
TO ANOTHER STRANGE BEDFELLOW

603
00:21:27,327 --> 00:21:29,413
AFTER HIS FIRST NIGHT AT SEA.

604
00:21:29,413 --> 00:21:31,373
- HOW WAS THE PARTY?

605
00:21:31,373 --> 00:21:33,958
narrator: 
AND MAEBY PITCHES HER TV SHOW

606
00:21:33,958 --> 00:21:36,545
TO A HOLLYWOOD ICON, WHO SAYS-

607
00:21:36,545 --> 00:21:40,757
- NO, I, UH-- 
I DON'T SEE IT AS A SERIES.

608
00:21:40,757 --> 00:21:42,384
MAYBE A MOVIE.
