00:00:01,251 --> 00:00:02,877
narrator: NOW THE STORY 
OF A WEALTHY FAMILY

2
00:00:02,877 --> 00:00:04,254
WHO LOST EVERYTHING...

3
00:00:04,254 --> 00:00:06,005
AND THE ONE SON 
WHO HAD NO CHOICE...

4
00:00:06,005 --> 00:00:08,258
BUT TO KEEP THEM ALL TOGETHER.

5
00:00:13,596 --> 00:00:15,973
IT'S ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT.

6
00:00:18,268 --> 00:00:19,852
MICHAEL WAS SHARING SOME VERY

7
00:00:19,852 --> 00:00:22,438
IMPORTANT NEWS WITH HIS PARENTS.

8
00:00:22,438 --> 00:00:24,732
- I AM GETTING MARRIED.

9
00:00:24,732 --> 00:00:27,277
- WHO THE HELL TO?

10
00:00:27,277 --> 00:00:29,362
- WHO DO YOU THINK? 
RITA.

11
00:00:29,362 --> 00:00:32,073
- HER? 
- WHY?

12
00:00:32,073 --> 00:00:34,284
- WELL, FIRST, SHE NEEDS A GREEN 
CARD TO STAY IN THE COUNTRY.

13
00:00:34,284 --> 00:00:35,535
- THERE IT IS.

14
00:00:35,535 --> 00:00:36,744
- SHE NEEDS A GREEN CARD 
TO STAY IN THE COUNTRY...

15
00:00:36,744 --> 00:00:40,081
BECAUSE, SECONDLY, WE'RE REALLY 
CRAZY ABOUT EACH OTHER.

16
00:00:40,081 --> 00:00:41,332
- YOU HARDLY KNOW HER.

17
00:00:41,332 --> 00:00:42,958
- I KNOW ALL THE IMPORTANT 
STUFF.

18
00:00:42,958 --> 00:00:44,877
SHE WAS IN THE OLYMPICS. 
- HUH!

19
00:00:44,877 --> 00:00:47,755
- SHE'S SWEET, SMART, 
SHE'S BEAUTIFUL. SHE'S SPECIAL.

20
00:00:47,755 --> 00:00:49,257
narrator: SHE WAS SPECIAL.

21
00:00:49,257 --> 00:00:50,508
- ARE HOUSES HARD TO MAKE?

22
00:00:50,508 --> 00:00:53,094
- ACTUALLY, THE HARDEST PART 
IS FINDING THE LAND.

23
00:00:53,094 --> 00:00:55,430
narrator: 
BUT SHE WASN'T SMART.

24
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:59,392
- INSTEAD OF MAKING HOUSES, 
MAYBE YOU SHOULD MAKE LAND--

25
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:01,018
narrator: FOR RITA HAD ONLY 
MENTALLY PROGRESSED...

26
00:01:01,018 --> 00:01:02,019
- ON THE OCEAN.

27
00:01:02,019 --> 00:01:04,021
narrator: TO THE LEVEL 
OF A FIRST-GRADER.

28
00:01:04,021 --> 00:01:06,482
- THERE'S NO LAND ON THE OCEAN.

29
00:01:06,482 --> 00:01:09,194
narrator: MICHAEL MIGHT HAVE 
NOTICED HER DISABILITY...

30
00:01:09,194 --> 00:01:11,987
IF IT HAD NOT BEEN MASKED 
BY HER ENGLISH ACCENT.

31
00:01:11,987 --> 00:01:15,575
- YOU'RE BRILLIANT. 
narrator: YEAH, SHE WASN'T.

32
00:01:15,575 --> 00:01:16,826
- I KNOW SHE'S A 
REALLY, REALLY GOOD PERSON.

33
00:01:16,826 --> 00:01:19,287
AND EVERYTHING ELSE IS GONNA BE 
LITTLE SURPRISES ALONG THE WAY.

34
00:01:19,287 --> 00:01:21,456
narrator: WITH THE EXCEPTION 
OF THAT ONE BIG ONE.

35
00:01:21,456 --> 00:01:25,960
- THE WEDDING IS IN ONE MONTH. 
- OH.

36
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:27,002
- A MONTH! 
- NOW, LOOK.

37
00:01:27,002 --> 00:01:28,671
JUST BECAUSE A WOMAN 
GETS PREGNANT,

38
00:01:28,671 --> 00:01:30,173
DOESN'T MEAN 
YOU HAVE TO MARRY HER.

39
00:01:30,173 --> 00:01:31,424
TOO MANY LIVES HAVE BEEN RUINED

40
00:01:31,424 --> 00:01:33,050
BECAUSE SOME CHEAP WAITRESS 
AT A HOJO...

41
00:01:33,050 --> 00:01:36,095
SAID SHE USED AN I.U.D.

42
00:01:36,095 --> 00:01:38,681
- IT WAS STUCKEY'S. 
- BUT I BELIEVED YOU.

43
00:01:38,681 --> 00:01:39,932
- SHE'S NOT PREGNANT.

44
00:01:39,932 --> 00:01:42,101
WE HAVEN'T EVEN 
SLEPT TOGETHER.

45
00:01:42,101 --> 00:01:43,853
- [laughing] 
- [laughing] THIS IS FUNNY.

46
00:01:43,853 --> 00:01:47,190
- HE'S GAY! 
- WHERE'S YOUR HAND?

47
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:48,774
- I'M HAVING MY HIGH SCHOOL RING 
PUT ON IT,

48
00:01:48,774 --> 00:01:51,111
AND MY HOOK IS STUCK 
IN THE STAIR CAR.

49
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:53,946
[radio] DOMO ARIGATO, MR. ROBOTO 
- DOMO ARIGATO, MR. ROBOTO

50
00:01:53,946 --> 00:01:57,450
- [singing] DOMO, DOMO 
- OH.

51
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:59,744
- DO YOU THINK GETTING MARRIED 
WILL SOLVE YOUR SEX PROBLEM?

52
00:01:59,744 --> 00:02:01,704
- NO, WE DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM.

53
00:02:01,704 --> 00:02:04,124
WE JUST HAVEN'T HAD THE RIGHT 
OPPORTUNITY YET.

54
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:06,209
- LINDSAY SAID RITA SLEPT OVER 
LAST NIGHT.

55
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:07,460
- YES, BUT I GAVE HER THE 
BEDROOM

56
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:09,337
BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT HER 
TO FEEL PRESSURED.

57
00:02:09,337 --> 00:02:10,755
narrator: 
ACTUALLY, IT WAS MICHAEL

58
00:02:10,755 --> 00:02:12,673
WHO FELT A LITTLE PRESSURED.

59
00:02:12,673 --> 00:02:14,634
- AND I LIKE TO KEEP 
THE LIGHT ON.

60
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:18,095
THAT WAY, I CAN SEE 
IF YOU HAVE A MONSTER.

61
00:02:18,095 --> 00:02:19,347
NIGHT-NIGHT.

62
00:02:19,347 --> 00:02:20,765
CAN YOU SHUT THE DOOR 
ON YOUR WAY OUT?

63
00:02:20,765 --> 00:02:22,767
- I CAN'T BELIEVE 
YOU'RE NOT SUPPORTING THIS.

64
00:02:22,767 --> 00:02:24,977
- BECAUSE IT IS OBVIOUS 
WHAT SHE'S AFTER.

65
00:02:24,977 --> 00:02:27,772
- OUR MONEY. 
- OH, GOD! OUR MONEY.

66
00:02:27,772 --> 00:02:29,232
- LET'S JUST ALL RELAX AND 
REMIND OURSELVES

67
00:02:29,232 --> 00:02:30,941
THAT WE DON'T HAVE ANY MONEY.

68
00:02:30,941 --> 00:02:31,984
- SHE'S ALREADY GOTTEN OUR 
MONEY!

69
00:02:31,984 --> 00:02:34,279
- LET'S NOT FORGET SHE'S THE ONE 
THAT GAVE US THE IDEA FOR THAT

70
00:02:34,279 --> 00:02:36,406
OCEAN-TOP TOWN CALLED BLUTHTON.

71
00:02:38,824 --> 00:02:41,702
- OH, BIG DEAL. I HAD THAT SAME 
BASIC IDEA YEARS AGO.

72
00:02:43,788 --> 00:02:45,831
- I THOUGHT YOU'D BE HAPPY. 
I SHOULD'VE KNOWN BETTER.

73
00:02:45,831 --> 00:02:47,082
- MICHAEL, BE CAREFUL.

74
00:02:47,082 --> 00:02:49,669
PEOPLE JUST SEE 
WHAT THEY WANT TO SEE.

75
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:52,129
IF SHE LOVED YOU, 
SHE'D SHOW IT.

76
00:02:52,129 --> 00:02:54,215
narrator: 
MICHAEL WAS WORRIED.

77
00:02:54,215 --> 00:02:56,551
HIS MOTHER MAY HAVE 
BEEN MAKING SENSE.

78
00:02:56,551 --> 00:02:59,053
SO HE RETURNED HOME 
TO TALK TO RITA.

79
00:02:59,053 --> 00:03:00,305
- HERE COMES THE BRIDE!

80
00:03:00,305 --> 00:03:02,390
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING 
IN A WHEELCHAIR?

81
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:05,100
- NO, NO. IT'S A DOLLY-- TO HELP 
VIDEOTAPE YOUR NUPTIALS.

82
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:06,352
- [camcorder runs]

83
00:03:06,352 --> 00:03:08,854
- I DON'T THINK I NEED ANY 
FOOTAGE OF MY NUPTIALS.

84
00:03:08,854 --> 00:03:10,273
TOBIAS, ARE YOU SURE 
THAT THIS DOLLY

85
00:03:10,273 --> 00:03:12,817
ISN'T RELATED 
TO YOUR RECENT HEALTH PROBLEMS?

86
00:03:12,817 --> 00:03:16,279
- OKAY, SO MY LEGS AND MY LEFT 
ARM OCCASIONALLY "GO TO SLEEP."

87
00:03:16,279 --> 00:03:18,656
AND YOU WANT TO CALL IT 
A HEALTH PROBLEM.

88
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:20,950
OOP. [groaning] 
- HEY. HEY, HEY!

89
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:23,828
- I CAN GET UP MYSELF. 
[grunts]

90
00:03:23,828 --> 00:03:26,080
- HERE WE GO. 
- LET ME GET IN THE DOLLY.

91
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,915
NO, THANK YOU. 
I DON'T NEED YOUR HELP.

92
00:03:27,915 --> 00:03:29,334
- IT DOES SEEM LIKE YOU'VE 
BEEN HAVING

93
00:03:29,334 --> 00:03:31,252
A LOT OF TROUBLE 
SINCE THE HAIR TRANSPLANTS.

94
00:03:31,252 --> 00:03:33,713
MAYBE YOU SHOULD SEE 
A "BUBAMAN."

95
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:35,256
- A BUBAMAN?

96
00:03:35,256 --> 00:03:37,633
- OH, UH, DOCTOR. 
IT'S A BRITISH EXPRESSION.

97
00:03:37,633 --> 00:03:39,760
LIKE THEY SAY "GO UP BOX" 
INSTEAD OF "ELEVATOR."

98
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:42,305
- OH, YES, LIKE WHEN THEY SAY 
"POOFTER" TO MEAN "TOURIST."

99
00:03:42,305 --> 00:03:43,556
BOY, THAT RITA'S A SMARTY.

100
00:03:43,556 --> 00:03:45,350
- TRUE, BUT IT'S NOT LIKE 
ANYBODY APPRECIATES IT.

101
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:46,601
MOM AND DAD DO NOT LIKE RITA.

102
00:03:46,601 --> 00:03:48,228
- ARE THEY CRAZY? 
SHE'S AMAZING.

103
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:49,479
I SAW HER LAST NIGHT.

104
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:51,105
SHE HELPED ME WITH 
THIS PROJECT I WAS DOING.

105
00:03:51,105 --> 00:03:53,608
narrator: MAEBY WAS STRUGGLING 
WITH A SCREENPLAY...

106
00:03:53,608 --> 00:03:55,860
IN HER SECRET LIFE 
AS A FILM EXECUTIVE.

107
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:57,111
- IS THAT A STORY?

108
00:03:57,111 --> 00:03:58,779
- NOT YET. 
IT DOESN'T HAVE AN ENDING.

109
00:03:58,779 --> 00:04:00,030
HE'S IN L.A. SHE'S IN JAPAN.

110
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:02,157
HOW DO I GET THESE TWO 
CHARACTERS TOGETHER?

111
00:04:02,157 --> 00:04:05,286
- MAYBE THEY COULD WALK. 
- ACROSS THE OCEAN?

112
00:04:05,286 --> 00:04:08,289
- IF IT'S NOT TOO DEEP. 
- NO. DEEP IS GOOD.

113
00:04:08,289 --> 00:04:09,540
PEOPLE ARE GONNA SAY,

114
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:11,334
"WHAT THE HELL JUST HAPPENED? 
I'D BETTER SAY I LIKE IT."

115
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:12,752
'CAUSE NOBODY WANTS 
TO SEEM STUPID.

116
00:04:12,752 --> 00:04:13,961
- I LIKE IT.

117
00:04:13,961 --> 00:04:15,212
- THE OCEAN WALKER. 
HOLY CRAP.

118
00:04:15,212 --> 00:04:16,839
THAT'S GONNA LOOK GOOD ON A HAT.

119
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:19,550
narrator: AND MICHAEL CAUGHT UP 
WITH HIS BROTHER.

120
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:20,801
- I NEED A FAVOR.

121
00:04:20,801 --> 00:04:22,177
AS YOU KNOW, I'M GETTIN' MARRIED 
IN ABOUT A MONTH.

122
00:04:22,177 --> 00:04:23,429
- SAY NO MORE.

123
00:04:23,429 --> 00:04:25,681
- GREAT. ARE YOU SURE 
THAT YOU KNOW WHAT--

124
00:04:25,681 --> 00:04:26,932
- YEP, YEP, YEP. GOT IT. 
SUPER.

125
00:04:26,932 --> 00:04:29,519
- AND JUST SO THAT 
WE'RE BOTH CLEAR--

126
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:32,522
- YOU WANT ME TO DO A MAGIC SHOW 
AT THE WEDDING. I'M ON IT.

127
00:04:32,522 --> 00:04:35,566
- I'M SO GLAD WE PUSHED 
THROUGH THAT. NO MAGIC.

128
00:04:35,566 --> 00:04:38,611
- WHY, BECAUSE OF THE ONE 
LITTLE SCREWUP LAST TIME?

129
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:41,406
- PUT HER OUT! PUT HER OUT! 
TRACEY! ON FIRE! ROLL!

130
00:04:41,406 --> 00:04:43,366
- THANK GOD WE ALREADY 
DID THE PICTURES.

131
00:04:43,366 --> 00:04:44,825
- WHICH REMINDS ME THAT RITA 
SHOULDN'T

132
00:04:44,825 --> 00:04:47,119
WEAR ANY HAIR SPRAY 
AT THIS THING.

133
00:04:47,119 --> 00:04:48,413
- I JUST WANT YOU 
TO BE MY WITNESS.

134
00:04:48,413 --> 00:04:51,582
- YOU WANT ME TO--

135
00:04:51,582 --> 00:04:53,376
BE YOUR BEST MAN?

136
00:04:53,376 --> 00:04:56,170
- IT'S JUST A SIGNATURE 
I NEED ON THE LICENSE.

137
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:58,548
MY SON'S NOT OLD ENOUGH. 
IT'S-- IT'S NO BIG DEAL.

138
00:04:58,548 --> 00:05:01,091
- I WILL NOT TAKE 
THIS SACRED DUTY LIGHTLY.

139
00:05:01,091 --> 00:05:05,388
I AM GONNA GET YOU 
THE SINGLE HEALTHIEST CALL GIRL

140
00:05:05,388 --> 00:05:06,639
THAT THIS TOWN HAS EVER SEEN.

141
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:08,849
- THIS IS WHY I'M CALLING IT 
A WITNESS AND NOT A BEST MAN.

142
00:05:08,849 --> 00:05:11,018
ALL YOU GOTTA DO IS WATCH.

143
00:05:11,018 --> 00:05:13,313
- I'M NOT GONNA SPEND THIS KIND 
OF MONEY AND NOT WATCH.

144
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:14,314
[slaps butt]

145
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:15,773
- THIS MAY HAVE BEEN A BAD 
CHOICE.

146
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:20,403
HEY, HELLO. LOOK AT YOU TWO-- 
TWEEDLEDEE, TWEEDLEDUM.

147
00:05:20,403 --> 00:05:22,488
narrator: MICHAEL DIDN'T 
MEAN IT IN THAT WAY.

148
00:05:22,488 --> 00:05:25,115
HOW COULD HE? 
HE DIDN'T EVEN KNOW.

149
00:05:25,115 --> 00:05:26,367
- WE HAD THE BEST TIME.

150
00:05:26,367 --> 00:05:28,328
SHE'S GOT SUCH AN AMAZING 
FASHION SENSE.

151
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:29,995
YOU GUYS GOT THESE JACKETS 
ON INSIDE-OUT?

152
00:05:29,995 --> 00:05:31,331
- THAT WAY, YOU SEE THE LABEL.

153
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:32,873
- YEAH, I MEAN, THAT'S WHAT 
YOU'RE PAYING FOR, RIGHT?

154
00:05:32,873 --> 00:05:35,084
IT'S A GREAT STATEMENT 
ON FASHION.

155
00:05:35,084 --> 00:05:36,419
PLUS IT DOESN'T 
TICKLE YOUR NECK.

156
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:39,254
[both laugh]

157
00:05:39,254 --> 00:05:42,174
narrator: MICHAEL TOOK LINDSAY 
ASIDE TO SHARE HIS CONCERNS.

158
00:05:42,174 --> 00:05:45,386
- LINDSAY, WHEN DID YOU FIRST 
REALIZE THAT YOU AND TOBIAS...

159
00:05:45,386 --> 00:05:47,346
HAD NO CHANCE AT 
A PHYSICAL RELATIONSHIP?

160
00:05:47,346 --> 00:05:48,598
- OH, MY GOD.

161
00:05:48,598 --> 00:05:50,725
DO YOU THINK WE HAVE NO CHANCE 
AT A PHYSICAL RELATIONSHIP?

162
00:05:50,725 --> 00:05:51,976
- SO, JUST NOW.

163
00:05:51,976 --> 00:05:55,104
SEE, RITA AND I HAVE NOT 
BEEN PHYSICAL YET, AND--

164
00:05:55,104 --> 00:05:56,564
YOU DON'T THINK 
SHE'S DOING THIS JUST

165
00:05:56,564 --> 00:05:57,773
FOR A GREEN CARD, DO YOU?

166
00:05:57,773 --> 00:05:59,859
- NO. NO, SHE'S NOT THAT KIND 
OF PERSON.

167
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:02,528
YOU JUST HAVEN'T 
BEEN ALONE WITH HER.

168
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:04,363
ASK HER TO STAY OVER 
AT A HOTEL WITH YOU TONIGHT.

169
00:06:04,363 --> 00:06:05,698
SHE'S GONNA KNOW 
WHAT THAT MEANS.

170
00:06:05,698 --> 00:06:07,157
- THAT IS NOT A BAD IDEA.

171
00:06:07,157 --> 00:06:10,035
DON'T-- DON'T DO THAT.

172
00:06:10,035 --> 00:06:11,871
narrator: AND GOB BEGAN TO 
PREPARE A MAGIC TRICK

173
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:13,414

CLUBS. 
CLUB SAUCE.

177
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:24,341
HE COVERS HER 
WITH CLUB SAUCE.

178
00:06:24,341 --> 00:06:26,343
THAT'LL BE MY LINE 
IF THAT HAPPENS.

179
00:06:26,343 --> 00:06:29,013
- IS THAT A MAGIC TRICK? 
I LOVE MAGIC.

180
00:06:29,013 --> 00:06:33,768
- I DON'T APPRECIATE 
THE DRY BRITISH HUMOR.

181
00:06:33,768 --> 00:06:37,187
- PLEASE DO A MAGIC TRICK 
FOR ME.

182
00:06:37,187 --> 00:06:40,357
- WELL, I SHOULDN'T. 
I'D HATE TO BE BLAMED...

183
00:06:40,357 --> 00:06:45,320
FOR SETTING ANOTHER ONE OF 
MICHAEL'S BRIDES...ON FIRE!

184
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:48,198
- OH. LIGHTER FLUID, 
LIKE UNCLE TREVOR USES.

185
00:06:48,198 --> 00:06:50,159
BUT WHEREVER 
DID IT COME FROM?

186
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:53,412
- OKAY, I'VE GOTTA GET YOU 
INTO AN ILLUSION AT THE WEDDING.

187
00:06:53,412 --> 00:06:54,789
- HOW LONG CAN YOU 
HOLD YOUR BREATH?

188
00:06:54,789 --> 00:06:56,666
- OH, LONG. 
ONE TIME, 20 MINUTES.

189
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:57,917
- [inhales deeply]

190
00:06:57,917 --> 00:07:00,044
- narrator: ACTUALLY, 
HER RECORD WAS 20 SECONDS.

191
00:07:00,044 --> 00:07:02,296
- YOU CAN STOP IT. IT'S OKAY. 
I'M GONNA TAKE YOUR WORD FOR IT.

192
00:07:02,296 --> 00:07:03,297
[exhales]

193
00:07:03,297 --> 00:07:04,507
NOW I JUST NEED TO FIND A TRICK

194
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:06,341
THAT PUTS YOU OUT OF OXYGEN FOR 
20 MINUTES.

195
00:07:06,341 --> 00:07:07,718
- SORRY? 
DID I HEAR THE WORD "TRICK"?

196
00:07:07,718 --> 00:07:10,220
AND IT SMELLS A LOT 
LIKE LIGHTER FLUID IN HERE.

197
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:12,181
I DID SAY NO TRICKS, GOB, 
AND I MEAN IT.

198
00:07:12,181 --> 00:07:13,433
- WHAT IF I FIND A TRICK

199
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:15,560
THAT HAS HER FLOAT TO THE ALTAR 
OR SOMETHING?

200
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,687
- NO, NO. LOVE FOR HER TO WALK 
AND NOT TO DROWN...

201
00:07:17,687 --> 00:07:20,314
OR FLY THROUGH THE AIR 
OR CATCH ON FIRE.

202
00:07:20,314 --> 00:07:23,108
- IS SHE ALLERGIC TO CAT FUR? 
- UH, NO TIGERS.

203
00:07:23,108 --> 00:07:25,152
- GREAT.

204
00:07:25,152 --> 00:07:27,530
- SO, UH, RITA, UM,

205
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:30,365
I WAS WONDERING 
IF MAYBE YOU AND I...

206
00:07:30,365 --> 00:07:32,868
MIGHT HEAD DOWN 
TO A HOTEL?

207
00:07:32,868 --> 00:07:36,246
MAYBE SOME ALONE TIME. 
- OH, YES.

208
00:07:36,246 --> 00:07:38,958
- YEAH? 
- MAYBE OUR ROOMS COULD TOUCH.

209
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:41,544
[chuckling] 
- I--I WAS HOPING MAYBE FOR MORE

210
00:07:41,544 --> 00:07:43,879
THAN JUST OUR ROOMS TO TOUCH.

211
00:07:43,879 --> 00:07:46,549
I WAS THINKING MAYBE 
WE COULD BE...

212
00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:50,720
IN THE SAME ROOM, 
BE IN THE SAME BED.

213
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:54,515
- I SEE WHAT YOU MEAN-- 
A REAL SLEEPOVER.

214
00:07:54,515 --> 00:07:56,433
- WELL, MAYBE. 
- OKAY.

215
00:07:56,433 --> 00:07:57,685
- REALLY?

216
00:07:57,685 --> 00:07:59,019
- MAYBE I SHOULD GO HOME 
AND GET MY THINGS.

217
00:07:59,019 --> 00:08:01,063
I DO KINDA MISS 
MY JAMMIES.

218
00:08:01,063 --> 00:08:03,148
- I THINK THEY'RE GONNA HAVE 
A LOT OF THAT STUFF THERE.

219
00:08:03,148 --> 00:08:05,400
- AND MY TINY TEDDY.

220
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:09,029

00:08:14,744 --> 00:08:17,580

narrator: AND RITA PACKED 
FOR HER SLEEPOVER.

232
00:08:33,804 --> 00:08:35,389

WHAT A SLEEPOVER IS?

233
00:08:35,389 --> 00:08:37,182
'CAUSE IT'S NOT JUST SLEEP.

234
00:08:37,182 --> 00:08:40,686

240
00:08:54,491 --> 00:08:58,120
OH, AND FOR YOUR INFORMATION,

243
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:03,375
YOU'RE STILL A CHILD 
IN MANY WAYS.

244
00:09:03,375 --> 00:09:06,629
I GOT A PROBLEM WITH YOU HAVING 
SEXUAL RELATIONS WITH THAT MAN.

245
00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:07,880
narrator: SO DO I.

246
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,549

00:09:16,096 --> 00:09:18,891
'CAUSE WE'RE GETTING MARRIED.

251
00:09:18,891 --> 00:09:20,560
- MARRIED? 
- MARRIED!

252
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,811
- TOTALLY OUT OF THE QUESTION!

253
00:09:21,811 --> 00:09:23,813
- [singsong] 
MARRIED, MARRIED, MARRIED!

254
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:26,106
- ALL RIGHT, THAT DOES IT. 
YOU'RE NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

255
00:09:26,106 --> 00:09:27,900
I'M PUTTIN' THE INVISIBLE 
LOCKS ON THE DOOR.

256
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,026
- THAT'S NOT FAIR.

257
00:09:29,026 --> 00:09:31,195
- LOCK, LOCK. 
- THAT'S NOT FAIR!

258
00:09:31,195 --> 00:09:33,113
IT'S JUST NOT FAIR! 
- LOCK, LOCK.

259
00:09:35,032 --> 00:09:37,577
I GOTTA FIND A NEW HIDING PLACE 
FOR THAT MAGAZINE.

260
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:40,120
narrator: AND MICHAEL 
WAS WAITING AT THE HOTEL.

261
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:42,497

TO LET YOU KNOW...

262
00:09:42,497 --> 00:09:45,292
THAT I'M AT A HOTEL 
WITH MY WIFE-TO-BE.

263
00:09:45,292 --> 00:09:47,670
AND WE'RE VERY, 
VERY MUCH IN LOVE.

264
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:50,464
- PUT HER ON.

265
00:09:50,464 --> 00:09:52,717
narrator: MICHAEL BRIEFLY 
CONSIDERED FAKING THE VOICE.

266
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:53,718
- [falsetto] I--

267
00:09:53,718 --> 00:09:55,469
SHE'S IN THE SHOWER. 
- I'LL WAIT.

268
00:09:55,469 --> 00:09:57,137
- LET'S WAIT.

269
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:03,393
DON'T YOU WANT ME 
TO JUST CALL YOU BACK OR--

270
00:10:03,393 --> 00:10:06,105

I'M UNDER HOUSE ARREST.

271
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:08,148
LET'S WATCH SOMETHING 
TOGETHER.

272
00:10:09,942 --> 00:10:12,612
WOW. THAT BLOSSOM 
GREW UP, HUH?

273
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:14,655
SAY, HOW'S 
THAT SHOWER COMIN'?

274
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:16,323
- ALL RIGHT, LOOK, 
SHE'S NOT IN THE SHOWER.

275
00:10:16,323 --> 00:10:17,366
- REALLY?

276
00:10:17,366 --> 00:10:18,909
- SHE SAID THAT SHE'D 
MEET ME AT THE HOTEL.

277
00:10:18,909 --> 00:10:21,036
AND I CALLED YOU A LITTLE 
PREMATURELY, BUT SHE IS COMING.

278
00:10:21,036 --> 00:10:22,371
- REALLY?

279
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:30,170
- [snorts] 
- UH! HEY, PUT RITA ON.

280
00:10:30,170 --> 00:10:32,297
narrator: THAT'S WHEN MICHAEL 
FINALLY ACCEPTED...

281
00:10:32,297 --> 00:10:35,342
THAT RITA WASN'T COMING...

282
00:10:35,342 --> 00:10:38,553
AND THAT LOCAL CALLS 
WERE 2.95 A MINUTE.

283
00:10:38,553 --> 00:10:39,805
- COME ON!

284
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:41,974
narrator: 
THAT'S WHERE THEY GET YOU.

285
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:48,522
MICHAEL DROVE TO WEE BRITAIN

286
00:10:48,522 --> 00:10:50,650
TO CALL OFF THE WEDDING...

287
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:52,317
THAT HE NOW REALIZED 
WAS NOT BASED ON LOVE.

288
00:10:52,317 --> 00:10:53,443
[knocking]

289
00:10:53,443 --> 00:10:54,695
- WHO IS IT?

290
00:10:54,695 --> 00:10:56,363
- IT'S MICHAEL, RITA. 
CAN I COME IN?

291
00:10:56,363 --> 00:10:57,614
- I CAN'T LET YOU IN.

292
00:10:57,614 --> 00:10:59,366
- YOU KNOW YOU DIDN'T SHOW UP 
LAST NIGHT.

293
00:10:59,366 --> 00:11:01,994
I THINK THE LEAST YOU CAN DO 
IS TALK TO ME FACE-TO-FACE.

294
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:04,329
- I CAN'T. 
TREVOR LOCKED THE DOOR.

295
00:11:04,329 --> 00:11:06,874
HE DOESN'T WANT ME 
TO BE WITH YOU.

296
00:11:06,874 --> 00:11:09,293
- WHAT? HE LOCKED THE DOOR? 
YOU CAN'T UNLOCK THIS DOOR?

297
00:11:09,293 --> 00:11:10,544
- I CAN'T EVEN SEE 
HALF THE LOCKS.

298
00:11:10,544 --> 00:11:12,587
- RITA? WHAT?

299
00:11:12,587 --> 00:11:13,839
- THEY'RE INVISIBLE.

300
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:15,883
TREVOR'S THE ONLY ONE 
WHO CAN SEE THEM.

301
00:11:15,883 --> 00:11:17,134
- I'VE GOT AN IDEA.

302
00:11:17,134 --> 00:11:19,887
GO NEXT TO THE WINDOW. 
I'M GONNA CLIMB UP.

303
00:11:19,887 --> 00:11:22,848
- [gasps] BE CAREFUL. 
- I WILL.

304
00:11:26,101 --> 00:11:29,188
narrator: AND SO MICHAEL SET 
ABOUT RESCUING THE BEAUTIFUL,

305
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:34,026
SWEET, MENTALLY CHALLENGED 
WOMAN HE'D FALLEN IN LOVE WITH,

306
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:37,571
WITHOUT REALIZING 
SHE WAS MENTALLY CHALLENGED.

307
00:11:37,571 --> 00:11:40,115
- YEA, MICHAEL! YEA! 
- WHO UNDID THE LOCKS?

308
00:11:40,115 --> 00:11:42,159
- COME ON OUT. 
- TREVOR'S BACK.

309
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:43,911

- WHAT?

310
00:11:43,911 --> 00:11:45,704
- HOP ON. 
- HUH?

311
00:11:45,704 --> 00:11:49,959
- READY? 
- OH! OH!

312
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:52,211
WHEE! OH!

313
00:11:52,211 --> 00:11:55,005
- HEY! STOP THAT! 
THE BOTH OF YA COME BACK!

314
00:11:55,005 --> 00:11:58,175
- YOU CAN'T STOP US. 
- NOTHING CAN STOP US NOW.

315
00:11:58,175 --> 00:12:04,098
NOTHING IN THE WORLD OF MAN NOR 
BEAST NOR TIME CAN-- [grunts]

316
00:12:04,098 --> 00:12:07,392

317
00:12:07,392 --> 00:12:09,269

REUNITED WITH RITA,

318
00:12:09,269 --> 00:12:11,730
MICHAEL TOLD HIS PARENTS HE'D BE 
GETTING MARRIED TOMORROW.

319
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:12,898
- WE'RE GETTING MARRIED 
TOMORROW.

320
00:12:12,898 --> 00:12:15,400
- GOD HELP HER IF SHE TRIES 
TO RENAME BLUTHTON.

321
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:18,112
I'LL SINK IT FIRST. I SWEAR, 
I'LL SINK THE WHOLE DAMN THING.

322
00:12:18,112 --> 00:12:19,363

323
00:12:19,363 --> 00:12:20,906
THEY'RE GOIN' THROUGH WITH IT-- 
TOMORROW.

324
00:12:20,906 --> 00:12:22,157
[knocking]

325
00:12:22,157 --> 00:12:24,701

LUCILLE HAD A SURPRISE VISITOR.

326
00:12:24,701 --> 00:12:26,787
- ALL RIGHT! 
WHERE THE HELL IS RITA?

327
00:12:26,787 --> 00:12:29,373
I'M HER UNCLE. 
- LET THE HANDOUTS BEGIN.

328
00:12:29,373 --> 00:12:30,749
- THERE'S NOT GONNA BE 
ANY HANDOUTS,

329
00:12:30,749 --> 00:12:32,667
AND SHE IS 
NOT GONNA MARRY YOUR SON.

330
00:12:32,667 --> 00:12:34,086
- YOU'RE AGAINST 
THIS MARRIAGE TOO.

331
00:12:34,086 --> 00:12:35,295
- WELL, OF COURSE I AM.

332
00:12:35,295 --> 00:12:38,090
RITA'S NOT CAPABLE OF MAKIN' 
A DECISION LIKE THAT.

333
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:39,549
YOU ARE NOT GONNA GET 
RITA'S MILLIONS

334
00:12:39,549 --> 00:12:41,551
JUST BECAUSE 
SHE'S MENTALLY CHALLENGED.

335
00:12:41,551 --> 00:12:43,888
- MILLIONS? 
- MILLIONS?

336
00:12:43,888 --> 00:12:47,182
- MENTALLY CHALLENGED? 
- SHH! IT'S NOT POLITE.

337
00:12:47,182 --> 00:12:48,433
- SHE OWNS ALL OF WEE BRITAIN

338
00:12:48,433 --> 00:12:51,103
AND ALSO THE WEE BRITAIN 
IN CLEVELAND.

339
00:12:51,103 --> 00:12:53,272
'COURSE, WE'RE PROBABLY 
GONNA LOSE ALL THAT...

340
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:56,025
IF HER RIDICULOUS IDEA 
FOR SEA BRITAIN GOES THROUGH.

341
00:12:57,609 --> 00:12:59,611
- WE ARE NOT AFTER HER MONEY.

342
00:12:59,611 --> 00:13:04,366
- AND I DON'T THINK MICHAEL EVEN 
KNOWS ABOUT HER...CONDITION.

343
00:13:04,366 --> 00:13:06,410
- YEAH, IT'S FUNNY HOW AMERICANS 
DON'T PICK UP ON THAT.

344
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:07,702
I THINK IT'S 'CAUSE OF HER 
ACCENT

345
00:13:07,702 --> 00:13:10,247
AND THE PLASTIC SURGERY 
SHE'S BEEN ABLE TO AFFORD.

346
00:13:10,247 --> 00:13:12,749
WE WOULDN'T HAVE THIS TROUBLE 
IF THEY'D MET LAST YEAR.

347
00:13:14,584 --> 00:13:15,836
I GOTTA PUT A STOP TO THIS.

348
00:13:15,836 --> 00:13:18,297
I'M GONNA SEARCH EVERY 
BLOODY HOTEL IN TOWN.

349
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:20,799
- OH! LEGOLAND. 
I THINK THEY SAID...

350
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:22,051
THEY WERE GOING 
TO LEGOLAND.

351
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:23,052
- THEY DID SAY LEGOLAND.

352
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:24,803
- I DIDN'T HEAR ANYTHING 
ABOUT LEGOLAND.

353
00:13:24,803 --> 00:13:27,681
- HE DOESN'T KNOW 
WHAT HE'S TALKING ABOUT.

354
00:13:27,681 --> 00:13:30,309
[whispering] WE THINK HE MAY BE 
MENTALLY CHALLENGED.

355
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:32,477
- HUH? 
- ALL RIGHT THEN.

356
00:13:32,477 --> 00:13:34,188
- WE HAVE GOT 24 HOURS 
TO GET THEM MARRIED...

357
00:13:34,188 --> 00:13:35,856
[door closes]

358
00:13:35,856 --> 00:13:39,109
BEFORE MICHAEL FIGURES OUT 
WHAT SHE REALLY IS.

359
00:13:39,109 --> 00:13:41,486
- THIS IS THE FIRST TIME 
IN TWO YEARS

360
00:13:41,486 --> 00:13:44,323
YOU SOUND LIKE GEORGE BLUTH.

361
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:46,325
[Buster whimpers]

362
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:47,576
narrator: LATER THAT NIGHT,

363
00:13:47,576 --> 00:13:51,038
MICHAEL WAS AT THE HOTEL 
WITH HIS BRIDE-TO-BE.

364
00:13:51,038 --> 00:13:52,915
- RITA, I'VE BEEN REALLY 
LOOKING FORWARD TO THIS.

365
00:13:52,915 --> 00:13:54,583
- ME TOO.

366
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:59,004
I WANT TO HAVE 
SEXUAL RELATIONS.

367
00:13:59,004 --> 00:14:00,339
- THE MERE FACT 
THAT YOU CALL IT THAT

368
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:02,174
TELLS ME THAT YOU ARE READY.

369
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:04,634
- THAT'S WHY I BROUGHT THIS. 
- OH!

370
00:14:04,634 --> 00:14:05,886
[knocking]

371
00:14:05,886 --> 00:14:07,179
YOU GO AHEAD AND WHIP OUT 
THAT TINY TEDDY,

372
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:09,848
AND THEN WE'RE GONNA THINK UP 
A FUN SAFE WORD, OKAY?

373
00:14:09,848 --> 00:14:14,269
GEORGE MICHAEL, I DID NOT KNOW 
THAT YOU WERE--

374
00:14:14,269 --> 00:14:17,856
UM, GO AHEAD 
AND TALK OUT HERE.

375
00:14:17,856 --> 00:14:19,900
JUST GOT BACK FROM 
THE "BUMPADDLE" COURTS.

376
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:21,944
TOMORROW, 
I'M TEACHIN' HER BASEBALL.

377
00:14:21,944 --> 00:14:23,863
- IT MIGHT TAKE A WHILE. 
- SORRY?

378
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:26,365
- LISTEN, DAD, 
TH-THIS IS...HARD--

379
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:28,700
THIS IS HARD FOR ME TO SAY.

380
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:29,952
I WAS VIDEOTAPING RITA.

381
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:33,788
LET'S JUST SAY IT WOULD BE CUTE 
IF IT WAS SOMEONE MUCH YOUNGER.

382
00:14:33,788 --> 00:14:35,832
[symphonic music] 
[indistinct]

383
00:14:35,832 --> 00:14:37,542
I'M SORRY. MAYBE 
I SHOULD GET ANOTHER TAPE.

384
00:14:37,542 --> 00:14:39,044
THEY'RE NOT EXPENSIVE.

385
00:14:42,797 --> 00:14:46,260
- THAT'S THE PLASTIC FRUIT, DAD. 
[gags]

386
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:49,013
- IT'S VERY CONVINCING FRUIT. 
OKAY?

387
00:14:49,013 --> 00:14:53,392
AND-- SHE'S GOIN' 
BACK IN FOR ANOTHER?

388
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:54,643
YOU KNOW, THEY DON'T EVEN

389
00:14:54,643 --> 00:14:57,396
HAVE BANANAS IN ENGLAND. 
OKAY, SON?

390
00:14:57,396 --> 00:14:59,856
NOW, I KNOW 
THIS IS HARD FOR YOU,

391
00:14:59,856 --> 00:15:03,735
BUT IT WOULD BE NICE 
TO BE SUPPORTED IN SOME--

392
00:15:03,735 --> 00:15:05,737
NOW SHE'S GOIN' 
INTO THE GRAPES.

393
00:15:05,737 --> 00:15:08,240
- YEAH. 
SHE REALLY LIKED THOSE.

394
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,575
I'M SORRY.

395
00:15:10,575 --> 00:15:13,913
I THINK SHE MIGHT BE... 
RETAR-RETARDED.

396
00:15:16,706 --> 00:15:18,959
I'M SORRY. 
I'M REALLY SORRY.

397
00:15:24,339 --> 00:15:26,716
- SAY HELLO TO MY TINY TEDDY.

398
00:15:26,716 --> 00:15:30,930
[gasps] 
TINY TEDDY? OH!

399
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:33,348
narrator: AND THAT'S WHEN 
IT DAWNED ON MICHAEL.

400
00:15:33,348 --> 00:15:34,599
- OH, YOU TEACH KIDS, HUH?

401
00:15:34,599 --> 00:15:37,352
- I LIKE TO THINK 
THEY TEACH ME.

402
00:15:37,352 --> 00:15:39,563
THAT WAY I CAN SEE 
IF YOU HAVE A MONSTER.

403
00:15:42,774 --> 00:15:44,526
[gasps] 
BE CAREFUL.

404
00:15:53,618 --> 00:15:56,080
- I HAVE MADE A HUGE MISTAKE.

405
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:58,290
[loud smack] 
- [laughing]

406
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:05,505
narrator: 
MICHAEL HAD JUST BEEN SHOWN...

407
00:16:05,505 --> 00:16:09,259
THAT HIS FIANCE 
MIGHT BE MENTALLY CHALLENGED.

408
00:16:09,259 --> 00:16:10,635
BUT HE NEEDED PROOF.

409
00:16:10,635 --> 00:16:11,886
- SO ARE YOU READY 
FOR LIE-DOWN KISSES WITH ME?

410
00:16:11,886 --> 00:16:13,430
- MAYBE WE OUGHTA JUST 
TALK A LITTLE BIT.

411
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:14,514
[kissing]

412
00:16:14,514 --> 00:16:15,515
I MEAN, WHAT THE HECK?

413
00:16:15,515 --> 00:16:17,267
FOR INSTANCE, 
YOU'VE NEVER TOLD ME...

414
00:16:17,267 --> 00:16:19,936
HOW MANY HOUSES THERE ARE 
IN THE BRITISH PARLIAMENT.

415
00:16:19,936 --> 00:16:22,272
- SEVEN. 
- ARE THERE?

416
00:16:22,272 --> 00:16:25,109
narrator: THE ANSWER IS THREE. 
- DOES SOUND ABOUT RIGHT.

417
00:16:25,109 --> 00:16:27,319
narrator: 
THREE IS THE CORRECT ANSWER.

418
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:30,197
- RITA-- WHOA, WHOA, WHOA! 
- COME ON. LET'S HAVE OUR FUN!

419
00:16:30,197 --> 00:16:33,783
RITA CORNY MICHAEL.

420
00:16:33,783 --> 00:16:36,911
narrator: SO MICHAEL USED A LINE 
THAT WAS JUST AS CORNY.

421
00:16:36,911 --> 00:16:39,539
- YOU KNOW, I THINK 
THAT WE SHOULD WAIT...

422
00:16:39,539 --> 00:16:44,003
UNTIL AFTER WE'RE MARRIED.

423
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:46,963
- MARRIED! 
MARRIED, MARRIED, MARRIED!

424
00:16:46,963 --> 00:16:49,383
OKAY! 
NIGHT-NIGHT!

425
00:16:49,383 --> 00:16:50,967
narrator: 
AND MICHAEL FELT HE DESERVED

426
00:16:50,967 --> 00:16:54,971
A $15 THING OF CANDY BEANS.

427
00:16:58,850 --> 00:17:00,102
THE NEXT MORNING, HOWEVER,

428
00:17:00,102 --> 00:17:02,479
AS MICHAEL PREPARED 
TO LET RITA DOWN GENTLY,

429
00:17:02,479 --> 00:17:03,813
HE WAS MET WITH ANOTHER 
SURPRISE.

430
00:17:03,813 --> 00:17:05,065
- SURPRISE!

431
00:17:05,065 --> 00:17:07,817
- WHAT'S THIS? 
- WE'RE THROWING YOU A WEDDING.

432
00:17:07,817 --> 00:17:12,072
- [gasps] OH, HOW LOVELY! 
- ON US.

433
00:17:12,072 --> 00:17:13,323
EVERYTHING YOU SEE.

434
00:17:13,323 --> 00:17:14,866
SHOW HIM THE WAFFLE BAR, 
LARRY.

435
00:17:14,866 --> 00:17:17,744
- IT'S OVER THERE. 
- AND CHECK OUT BANNER, MICHAEL.

436
00:17:17,744 --> 00:17:20,580
I'M GONNA GO SET UP.

437
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:23,333
- I WAS JUST GONNA TALK TO RITA 
ABOUT ALL OF THIS.

438
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:28,047
RITA, I THINK THAT WE SHOULD, 
UM, WAIT A LITTLE WHILE.

439
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:30,590
- WAIT? WHY? 
I DON'T WANNA WAIT.

440
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:34,928
I WANT TO GET MARRIED 
AND HAVE SEXUAL RELATIONS

441
00:17:34,928 --> 00:17:36,346
LIKE YOU PROMISED.

442
00:17:36,346 --> 00:17:38,390
- WHERE DID YOU GET 
THIS FIRECRACKER?

443
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:40,767
I LOVE HER, MICHAEL.

444
00:17:40,767 --> 00:17:43,437
- SO DO I. I WANNA KISS 
MY NEW DAUGHTER-IN-LAW.

445
00:17:43,437 --> 00:17:44,688
- HEY, NOT ON OUR TIME, 
LARRY.

446
00:17:44,688 --> 00:17:46,106
- RIGHT ON THE LIPS.

447
00:17:46,106 --> 00:17:47,357
- NO, NO. PLEASE, TAKE IT EASY.

448
00:17:47,357 --> 00:17:49,943
- I'M GONNA GET MY DRESS 
FROM THE-- FROM THE ROOM.

449
00:17:49,943 --> 00:17:52,279
- YES. I'LL HELP YOU 
PUT IT ON INSIDE-OUT.

450
00:17:52,279 --> 00:17:55,282
- LET'S-- LET'S NOT 
ALL GET, UM--

451
00:17:55,282 --> 00:17:56,533
MOM, WHAT'S GOIN' ON?

452
00:17:56,533 --> 00:17:58,118
I THOUGHT YOU GUYS 
WERE AGAINST ALL THIS.

453
00:17:58,118 --> 00:18:00,204
- WELL, WE FEEL 
THAT YOU KNOW BEST...

454
00:18:00,204 --> 00:18:02,997
AND WHO ARE WE TO INTERFERE, 
AND YOU LOVE THIS GIRL.

455
00:18:02,997 --> 00:18:06,293
AND THE REST WILL JUST BE 
LITTLE HAPPY SURPRISES...

456
00:18:06,293 --> 00:18:07,544
ALONG THE WAY LIKE YOU SAID.

457
00:18:07,544 --> 00:18:12,466
- YEAH. WITH THE EXCEPTION 
OF THE RETARD THING.

458
00:18:12,466 --> 00:18:13,717
- OH, GOD.

459
00:18:13,717 --> 00:18:16,303
- TELL ME YOU DIDN'T 
JUST SAY THAT.

460
00:18:16,303 --> 00:18:18,888
- YOU KNEW? 
[moans]

461
00:18:18,888 --> 00:18:21,266
YOU KNEW, YET YOU STILL WANTED 
ME TO GO THROUGH WITH THIS.

462
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:22,309
- WHAT CAN I SAY?

463
00:18:22,309 --> 00:18:24,269
I'M CRAZY ABOUT 
THE LITTLE DULLARD.

464
00:18:24,269 --> 00:18:26,480
- OH, MY GOD. 
SHE'S RICH.

465
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:29,691
THIS IS A NEW LOW, 
EVEN FOR YOU, MOM.

466
00:18:31,901 --> 00:18:33,987
- WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?

467
00:18:33,987 --> 00:18:35,530
- LARRY, GO TO A MIRROR.

468
00:18:38,325 --> 00:18:40,702
- YOU'RE FIRED. 
- YOU'RE FIRED. WHAT?

469
00:18:40,702 --> 00:18:41,953
IT'S OVER.

470
00:18:41,953 --> 00:18:44,539
AND THIS IS HOW YOU TELL ME-- 
IN THE MIDDLE OF A WEDDING?

471
00:18:44,539 --> 00:18:45,915
YOU SHOULDN'T 
HAVE SAID ANYTHING.

472
00:18:45,915 --> 00:18:47,251
YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE SAID 
ANYTHING.

473
00:18:47,251 --> 00:18:48,877
- YOU WERE RIGHT. 
NOW WHAT AM I GONNA DO?

474
00:18:48,877 --> 00:18:50,129
- I'VE BEEN THINKING.

475
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:51,796
YOU KNOW, EVERY SOCIETY HAS 
THEIR OWN RULES

476
00:18:51,796 --> 00:18:52,839
ABOUT THIS STUFF.

477
00:18:52,839 --> 00:18:53,840
FOR INSTANCE, IN SOME STATES,

478
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:55,384
IT'S LEGAL TO MARRY 
YOUR OWN COUSIN.

479
00:18:55,384 --> 00:18:57,177
CALIFORNIA'S BLOCKED IT TWICE, 
BUT THAT'S ONLY BECAUSE THEY

480
00:18:57,177 --> 00:18:59,138
TACKED IT ONTO AN ESTATE LAW 
THING THAT WASN'T GOING TO PASS.

481
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:00,805
WE HAD THE SIGNATURES THOUGH.

482
00:19:00,805 --> 00:19:01,931
- YOU'RE 16, 
AND YOU KNOW ALL THAT.

483
00:19:01,931 --> 00:19:03,183
SHE'S 30 AND A HALF.

484
00:19:03,183 --> 00:19:05,059
SHE PROBABLY CAN'T LIST 
THE SEVEN HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT.

485
00:19:05,059 --> 00:19:07,396
- THERE'S THREE. 
- NOW I GOTTA BREAK HER HEART.

486
00:19:07,396 --> 00:19:10,149
- DOESN'T SHE HAVE TO LEAVE THE 
COUNTRY IF YOU DON'T MARRY HER?

487
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:13,568
- YEAH, I GUESS I CAN KEEP MY 
PROMISE ABOUT THAT, HUH?

488
00:19:13,568 --> 00:19:15,570
THERE WOULDN'T BE ANY 
REAL INTIMACY,

489
00:19:15,570 --> 00:19:18,615
AND IT WOULD BE THE STRONGEST 
MARRIAGE IN THE FAMILY.

490
00:19:18,615 --> 00:19:19,866
BUT AS MUCH AS I'D LIKE TO,

491
00:19:19,866 --> 00:19:22,952
YOU CAN'T IGNORE THE FACT 
THAT SHE IS MENTALLY DISABLED.

492
00:19:22,952 --> 00:19:24,246
- OH, MY GOD.

493
00:19:27,749 --> 00:19:29,793
- I'M WEARING AN INSIDE-OUT 
BRIDESMAID'S DRESS.

494
00:19:29,793 --> 00:19:31,044
- YOU'D BETTER CATCH HER, DAD.

495
00:19:31,044 --> 00:19:35,465
- NOT GONNA BE EASY. 
SHE'S AN OLYMPIC SILVER--

496
00:19:35,465 --> 00:19:37,842
JUST FIGURED 
THAT ONE OUT.

497
00:19:37,842 --> 00:19:41,930
- OKAY. WELL, I HAVE TO GO STOP 
PRODUCTION ON THE OCEAN WALKER.

498
00:19:45,141 --> 00:19:48,645
- YOU FOUND OUT. 
- TOOK ME LONG ENOUGH.

499
00:19:48,645 --> 00:19:51,815
- MAYBE YOU'RE NOT SMART EITHER.

500
00:19:51,815 --> 00:19:53,983
I DIDN'T KNOW 
UNTIL THEY TOLD ME.

501
00:19:53,983 --> 00:19:55,235
- NO. 
I'M JUST A NARCISSIST

502
00:19:55,235 --> 00:19:57,279
WHO WAS TOO SELF-INVOLVED 
TO SEE THE TRUTH.

503
00:19:57,279 --> 00:19:59,072
- THAT MAKES NO SENSE TO ME.

504
00:19:59,072 --> 00:20:00,324
- MAYBE YOU'RE RIGHT.

505
00:20:00,324 --> 00:20:02,033
MAYBE I'M BEING 
TOO HARD ON MYSELF.

506
00:20:02,033 --> 00:20:03,285
YOU KNOW, THE TRUTH IS--

507
00:20:03,285 --> 00:20:06,205
IS THAT I DID JUST SEE 
WHAT I WANTED TO SEE.

508
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:09,749
RITA, YOU'RE SO BEAUTIFUL, 
AND YOU'RE SO SWEET.

509
00:20:09,749 --> 00:20:13,670
AND YOU DESERVE TO FIND SOMEBODY 
A LOT MORE LIKE YOU.

510
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:16,965
I DON'T THINK THAT EITHER ONE OF 
US WOULD BE HAPPY.

511
00:20:16,965 --> 00:20:19,175
- SO, IT'S BYE-BYE 
TO RITA THEN?

512
00:20:19,175 --> 00:20:21,636
- UNLESS YOU REALLY WANT 
TO STAY IN AMERICA.

513
00:20:21,636 --> 00:20:25,724
- I WANTED TO BE WITH YOU. 
- HOY! RITA!

514
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:28,935
TIME TO GO NOW. 
BACK TO ENGLAND, LOVE.

515
00:20:28,935 --> 00:20:32,105
- OH, MICHAEL, WILL YOU 
COME VISIT ME LOTS?

516
00:20:32,105 --> 00:20:33,440
- THAT'S GONNA BE DIFFICULT, 
RITA.

517
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,692
YOU'RE GONNA BE 
ACROSS AN OCEAN.

518
00:20:35,692 --> 00:20:38,320
- WELL, YOU CAN ALWAYS WALK. 
- NOT ON THE WATER.

519
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:41,615
- OH, MICHAEL, YOU'RE SUCH A 
GROWN-UP.

520
00:20:41,615 --> 00:20:42,866
[sighs]

521
00:20:48,497 --> 00:20:49,914
- HEY! 
HE-HEY!

522
00:20:54,210 --> 00:20:55,462
HANG ON A SEC.

523
00:20:55,462 --> 00:20:57,297
THAT'S PART 
OF YOUR TRICK, RIGHT?

524
00:20:57,297 --> 00:21:01,092
- NO. THAT'S NOT 
MY TRICK, MICHAEL.

525
00:21:05,221 --> 00:21:08,392
narrator: ON THE NEXT 
ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT.

526
00:21:08,392 --> 00:21:10,269
- IT'S MY ILLUSION!

527
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:12,354
narrator: MICHAEL RELIVES 
A WEDDING NIGHTMARE.

528
00:21:12,354 --> 00:21:13,605
- HELP! 
PUT HIM OUT!

529
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:15,064
- MY HAIR! 
MY BEAUTIFUL HAIR!

530
00:21:15,064 --> 00:21:18,485
- PUSH HIM IN THE POOL! 
- WHY AM I NOT GOING UNDERWATER?

531
00:21:18,485 --> 00:21:20,862
DEAR GOD! WHY AM I NOT 
GOING UNDERWATER?
