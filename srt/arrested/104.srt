1
00:00:04,504 --> 00:00:07,507
- MICHAEL BLUTH ARRIVED HOME 
TO FIND THE RENTAL CAR

2
00:00:07,507 --> 00:00:10,218
HIS SISTER, LINDSAY, 
HAD PROMISED TO RETURN.

3
00:00:10,218 --> 00:00:12,428
- LINDSAY, YOU HAVE TO CUT BACK 
ON EVERYTHING.

4
00:00:12,428 --> 00:00:14,430
OKAY? I'M EVEN 
SELLING THE CORPORATE JET.

5
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:17,267
- GREAT. SO NOW WE DON'T HAVE 
A CAR OR A JET?

6
00:00:17,267 --> 00:00:20,061
WHY DON'T WE JUST TAKE AN AD OUT 
IN "I'M POOR" MAGAZINE?

7
00:00:20,061 --> 00:00:22,688
- LOOK, I'M TRYING TO GET 
DEVELOPMENT STARTED, ALL RIGHT?

8
00:00:22,688 --> 00:00:25,108
I'VE GOT SIX GUYS ON BULLDOZERS 
WAITING TO GET UNDERWAY.

9
00:00:25,108 --> 00:00:26,109
- BULLDOZING? 
- YEAH.

10
00:00:26,109 --> 00:00:27,527
- WELL, WHAT ABOUT THE TREES?

11
00:00:27,527 --> 00:00:30,030
- OH, WE'RE JUST GONNA 
COVER THEM WITH BLANKETS.

12
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:31,239
I'M RIPPING 'EM OUT.

13
00:00:31,239 --> 00:00:33,449
- ANYTHING FOR A BUCK, RIGHT?

14
00:00:33,449 --> 00:00:35,951
YOU ARE SO MATERIALISTIC.

15
00:00:35,951 --> 00:00:37,953
- DON'T SUDDENLY TURN THIS 
INTO ONE OF YOUR CAUSES.

16
00:00:37,953 --> 00:00:39,789
- IT'S NOT SUDDEN, MICHAEL.

17
00:00:39,789 --> 00:00:41,791
I'VE ALWAYS BEEN DEEPLY 
PASSIONATE ABOUT NATURE.

18
00:00:41,791 --> 00:00:43,668
PERHAPS YOU REMEMBER NEUTERFEST?

19
00:00:43,668 --> 00:00:45,545
- I'LL NEVER FORGET 
YOUR WEDDING.

20
00:00:45,545 --> 00:00:47,630
- I CARE DEEPLY FOR NATURE.

21
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:49,090
- YOU'RE WEARING 
OSTRICH SKIN BOOTS.

22
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:51,634
- WELL, I DON'T CARE 
ABOUT OSTRICHES.

23
00:00:51,634 --> 00:00:53,803
- YOU'RE LOOKING AT 
A DESPERATE MAN, MICHAEL.

24
00:00:53,803 --> 00:00:55,138
- DO YOU NEED MONEY?

25
00:00:55,138 --> 00:00:56,597
- WHAT I NEED IS FREEDOM.

26
00:00:56,597 --> 00:01:01,018
MARTA IS BEING 
INTERVIEWED TODAY ON TV

27
00:01:01,018 --> 00:01:04,439
ABOUT HER SHOW, 
"EL AMOR PROHIBIDO."

28
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:06,482
I MEAN, IT'S BAD ENOUGH THAT I 
GOTTA GO TO THE AWARDS SHOW

29
00:01:06,482 --> 00:01:07,608
TOMORROW NIGHT.

30
00:01:07,608 --> 00:01:10,861
TODAY I GOTTA STAND NEXT TO HER 
LIKE I'M RITA WILSON.

31
00:01:10,861 --> 00:01:14,574
- GOB'S GIRLFRIEND MARTA HAD BEN 
NOMINATED FOR A DAYTIME DESI,

32
00:01:14,574 --> 00:01:18,161
THE AWARD GIVEN FOR EXCELLENCE 
IN SPANISH DAYTIME TELEVISION.

33
00:01:18,161 --> 00:01:20,121
- GOB, YOU FOUND A WOMAN 
WHO BELIEVES IN YOU.

34
00:01:20,121 --> 00:01:22,582
YOU SHOULD MAKE A COMMITMENT TO 
HER, 'CAUSE LIFE IS SHORT.

35
00:01:22,582 --> 00:01:23,749
LISTEN TO ME.

36
00:01:23,749 --> 00:01:26,294
I WOULD GIVE ANYTHING 
TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THAT AGAIN.

37
00:01:26,294 --> 00:01:29,339
YOU KNOW? A FAMILY? 
NOTHING ELSE MATTERS.

38
00:01:29,339 --> 00:01:31,048
- MICHAEL! 
- THAT'S MOM. HIDE.

39
00:01:31,048 --> 00:01:33,593
- [whispering] 
YOU BROUGHT UP MONEY EARLIER.

40
00:01:33,593 --> 00:01:35,470
I ACTUALLY WOULD LIKE 
TO BORROW SOME.

41
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:37,138
- NO. 
- MICHAEL?

42
00:01:37,138 --> 00:01:38,389
- HE'S IN HERE, MOM!

43
00:01:38,389 --> 00:01:39,849
- COME ON. 
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

44
00:01:39,849 --> 00:01:42,227
NO WAY. THAT'S MINE. 
GIVE IT TO ME!

45
00:01:42,227 --> 00:01:44,770
- GOB, WAIT! 
I NEED THOSE TICKETS!

46
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:46,189
- [sighs]

47
00:01:46,189 --> 00:01:48,608
- HE PROMISED ME TICKETS 
TO HIS GIRLFRIEND'S AWARDS SHOW.

48
00:01:48,608 --> 00:01:50,651
- YOU'RE GOING 
TO THAT THING?

49
00:01:50,651 --> 00:01:53,363
- WELL, MY DEAR FRIEND 
LUCILLE AUSTERO

50
00:01:53,363 --> 00:01:55,281
IS PART OWNER 
OF A TELEVISION STATION,

51
00:01:55,281 --> 00:01:59,244
AND I WANT TO SHOW UP 
AND HOLD MY HEAD HIGH.

52
00:01:59,244 --> 00:02:00,536
I MAY NOT HAVE HER MONEY 
ANYMORE,

53
00:02:00,536 --> 00:02:02,247
BUT AT LEAST 
I HAVE A LIVE HUSBAND.

54
00:02:02,247 --> 00:02:05,208
- AH, SHE'S LUCKY TO HAVE YOU 
AS A FRIEND.

55
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:07,210
BUSTER.

56
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:08,085
- HEY, BROTHER.

57
00:02:08,085 --> 00:02:11,046
UH, MOM SAID YOU COULD 
TIE THIS FOR ME.

58
00:02:11,046 --> 00:02:15,385
- MAKE IT LONG SO BUSTER DOESN'T 
SEEM SO...ROUND.

59
00:02:15,385 --> 00:02:16,427
- COME HERE, PAL.

60
00:02:16,427 --> 00:02:17,428
- THANK YOU.

61
00:02:17,428 --> 00:02:18,846
- WHAT, DO YOU GUYS 
GOT A BIG DATE?

62
00:02:18,846 --> 00:02:19,972
- WELL, WE'RE NOT DATING.

63
00:02:19,972 --> 00:02:21,307
[chuckles]

64
00:02:21,307 --> 00:02:23,226
- NONETHELESS-- 
COME HERE--

65
00:02:23,226 --> 00:02:25,228
SHOULDN'T BUSTER 
BE SPENDING HIS EVENINGS

66
00:02:25,228 --> 00:02:28,356
WITH WOMEN THAT AREN'T SO 
MUCH...HIS MOTHER?

67
00:02:28,356 --> 00:02:31,192
- HE'S A BEAUTIFUL BOY. 
THEY DON'T APPRECIATE HIM.

68
00:02:31,192 --> 00:02:33,068
IT'S HIS GLASSES.

69
00:02:33,068 --> 00:02:34,904
THEY MAKE HIM LOOK 
LIKE A LIZARD.

70
00:02:35,946 --> 00:02:37,490
- PLUS, HE'S SELF-CONSCIOUS.

71
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:38,491
- GEE, I WONDER WHY.

72
00:02:38,491 --> 00:02:39,325
- YOU'RE ONE TO TALK.

73
00:02:39,325 --> 00:02:41,244
WHEN'S THE LAST TIME 
YOU WENT ON A DATE?

74
00:02:41,244 --> 00:02:42,245
- I JUST HAVEN'T MET ANYBODY

75
00:02:42,245 --> 00:02:43,746
WHO'S NOT COMPLETELY 
SELF-ABSORBED

76
00:02:43,746 --> 00:02:46,249
AND IMPOSSIBLE 
TO HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH.

77
00:02:46,249 --> 00:02:48,751
- IF THAT'S A VEILED CRITICISM 
ABOUT ME,

78
00:02:48,751 --> 00:02:51,045
I WON'T HEAR IT 
AND I WON'T RESPOND TO IT.

79
00:02:51,045 --> 00:02:53,548
- HMM. 
MAYBE I'M WRONG.

80
00:02:53,548 --> 00:02:54,882
- LATER THAT DAY MICHAEL 
FINALIZED

81
00:02:54,882 --> 00:02:57,260
THE SALE OF THE CORPORATE JET

82
00:02:57,260 --> 00:03:00,471
AND WAS ALSO ABLE TO SOLVE THE 
FAMILY'S TRANSPORTATION PROBLEM.

83
00:03:00,471 --> 00:03:02,181
- HMM?

84
00:03:02,181 --> 00:03:03,474
- I AM NOT RIDING 
IN THAT THING.

85
00:03:03,474 --> 00:03:05,726
- WELL, WE SOLD THE JET, 
AND THEY DIDN'T WANT THIS.

86
00:03:05,726 --> 00:03:06,602
WHAT AM I GONNA DO?

87
00:03:06,602 --> 00:03:10,105
BESIDES, LINDSAY, IT'S NOT 
LIKE YOU'RE MATERIALISTIC.

88
00:03:10,105 --> 00:03:12,775
WELL, THEN, 
IT'S ALL YOURS.

89
00:03:12,775 --> 00:03:14,569
WATCH OUT FOR BRIDGES 
AND HOP-ONS.

90
00:03:14,569 --> 00:03:17,780
YOU'RE GONNA GET 
SOME HOP-ONS.

91
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:19,865
- AND MICHAEL 
WAS FINALLY PREPARED

92
00:03:19,865 --> 00:03:22,827
TO BEGIN THE NEXT PHASE 
OF THE FAMILY BUSINESS.

93
00:03:22,827 --> 00:03:25,705
- WE GO TO TRISHA THOON 
FOR MORE.

94
00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:26,956
- AN ACTIVIST 
KNOWN AS JOHNNY BARK

95
00:03:26,956 --> 00:03:29,625
HAS TAKEN RESIDENCE 
IN HIS BELOVED TREE

96
00:03:29,625 --> 00:03:31,586
AND REFUSES TO COME DOWN.

97
00:03:31,586 --> 00:03:33,588
WHAT IS HE PROTESTING?

98
00:03:33,588 --> 00:03:36,466
THE EXPANSION OF HIGH-COST, 
LOW-QUALITY MINI-MANSIONS

99
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:38,468
LIKE THIS ONE HERE.

100
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:40,428
[knocks on window, 
glass shatters]

101
00:03:40,428 --> 00:03:42,722
- YOU GOTTA BE KIDDING ME.

102
00:03:48,603 --> 00:03:51,814
- MICHAEL MET WITH HIS SISTER 
ABOUT THE ACTIVIST IN THE TREE.

103
00:03:51,814 --> 00:03:53,774
- YOU WANT ME 
TO GET HIM OUT?

104
00:03:53,774 --> 00:03:56,026
- OH, COME ON, 
IT'S ONE TREE.

105
00:03:56,026 --> 00:03:57,570
LISTEN, AFTER WE 
GET THAT LOT CLEARED,

106
00:03:57,570 --> 00:03:59,029
WE'RE GONNA HAVE ENOUGH MONEY

107
00:03:59,029 --> 00:04:01,282
FOR YOU TO NEUTER 
THOUSANDS OF ANIMALS.

108
00:04:01,282 --> 00:04:03,451
YOU CAN MAKE DOGS AND CATS 
A COMPLETE THING OF THE PAST.

109
00:04:03,451 --> 00:04:04,869
NO MORE DOGS AND CATS.

110
00:04:04,869 --> 00:04:07,330
AND WE WILL HAVE 
ENOUGH MONEY

111
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:10,708
FOR ME TO REPLACE THE STAIR CAR 
WITH A NORMAL CAR.

112
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:13,336
- I'LL DO IT FOR THE CATS.

113
00:04:13,336 --> 00:04:15,838
- MEANWHILE, MARTA'S INTERVIEW 
WAS UNDERWAY,

114
00:04:15,838 --> 00:04:17,757
AND GOB WAS GETTING 
UNCOMFORTABLE

115
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:19,342
PLAYING THE SUPPORTIVE ROLE.

116
00:04:19,342 --> 00:04:22,928
- I JUST TOLD HIM THAT 
WE ARE THIS FAMILY NOW

117
00:04:22,928 --> 00:04:25,890
AND THAT CAREER'S ONE THING, 
BUT FAMILY IS FOREVER.

118
00:04:27,517 --> 00:04:30,060
- I, TOO, HAVE 
AN ANNOUNCEMENT TO MAKE.

119
00:04:32,355 --> 00:04:35,358
TO PROVE THAT NO PRISON 
CAN HOLD ME,

120
00:04:35,358 --> 00:04:36,359
I WILL INCARCERATE MYSELF

121
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:38,986
IN THE PENITENTIARY 
THAT HOLDS MY OWN FATHER,

122
00:04:38,986 --> 00:04:42,072
ONLY TO ESCAPE 
24 HOURS LATER.

123
00:04:42,072 --> 00:04:44,367
NO SHACKLES 
CAN HOLD THESE HANDS.

124
00:04:45,993 --> 00:04:47,662
SAY THAT TO THEM IN SPANISH.

125
00:04:47,662 --> 00:04:48,954
- THE NEXT DAY,

126
00:04:48,954 --> 00:04:50,998
MICHAEL GOT A CALL 
TO MEET GOB AT THE PRISON.

127
00:04:50,998 --> 00:04:51,999
- YOU'RE GOING INTO PRISON?

128
00:04:51,999 --> 00:04:54,669
I THOUGHT THERE WAS 
SOMETHING WRONG WITH DAD.

129
00:04:54,669 --> 00:04:55,670
- WHAT? NO, DAD'S FINE.

130
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:57,463
JUST SAW HIM IN THERE 
THROWING THE BALL AROUND

131
00:04:57,463 --> 00:04:58,881
WITH A COUPLE GUYS.

132
00:04:58,881 --> 00:05:00,758
WHICH, OF COURSE, 
HE NEVER DID WITH ME.

133
00:05:00,758 --> 00:05:02,468
- HOW'D YOU EVEN GET THEM 
TO AGREE TO THIS?

134
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:04,178
- OH, THE WARDEN'S A FAN.

135
00:05:04,178 --> 00:05:06,138
- YOU REALLY THINK 
YOU CAN BREAK OUT OF MY PRISON?

136
00:05:06,138 --> 00:05:09,016
- YOU WON'T EVEN KNOW 
I WAS HERE.

137
00:05:09,016 --> 00:05:11,727
- THE WARDEN WAS INTRIGUED-- 
LESS ABOUT THE STUNT

138
00:05:11,727 --> 00:05:13,396
AND MORE ABOUT THE PRISON 
BEATINGS

139
00:05:13,396 --> 00:05:15,481
THIS BRASH MAGICIAN 
WAS SURE TO RECEIVE.

140
00:05:15,481 --> 00:05:17,024
- ANY PRESS 
IS GOOD PRESS, HUH?

141
00:05:17,024 --> 00:05:18,067
- [Gob chuckling]

142
00:05:18,067 --> 00:05:20,069
RIGHT.

143
00:05:20,069 --> 00:05:22,405
- AND SO GOB WENT ABOUT 
SWALLOWING THE KEY

144
00:05:22,405 --> 00:05:23,989
TO PREPARE FOR HIS ESCAPE.

145
00:05:45,928 --> 00:05:47,763
- [laughing]

146
00:05:47,763 --> 00:05:48,764
THEN I PASS THE KEY,

147
00:05:48,764 --> 00:05:51,642
BUST OUT OF PRISON 
AND INTO MAGIC HISTORY.

148
00:05:51,642 --> 00:05:53,227
OF COURSE, THAT IS 
GONNA CONFLICT

149
00:05:53,227 --> 00:05:55,771
WITH MY GOING TO THE DESIS 
WITH MARTA.

150
00:05:55,771 --> 00:05:58,023
- WELL, LIFE'S A COMPROMISE.

151
00:05:58,023 --> 00:05:59,942
I PROBABLY WOULD HAVE 
TAKEN HER TO THE NICE EVENT,

152
00:05:59,942 --> 00:06:01,402
BUT PRISON'LL BE FUN TOO.

153
00:06:01,402 --> 00:06:02,945
- THANK YOU. 
I KNEW YOU'D COME THROUGH.

154
00:06:02,945 --> 00:06:04,447
- COME THROUGH? 
HOW'D I COME THROUGH?

155
00:06:04,447 --> 00:06:06,991
GOB, HOW'D I COME THROUGH?

156
00:06:09,619 --> 00:06:11,954
- YOU MIGHT WANNA FIND SOMETHING 
A LITTLE STRONGER, WARDEN.

157
00:06:11,954 --> 00:06:13,163
[electric zap]

158
00:06:13,163 --> 00:06:15,750
[groans] 
WHAT IS YOUR PROBLEM?

159
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:18,210
- MEANWHILE, 
LINDSAY SET ABOUT

160
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:21,005
FULFILLING HER PROMISE 
TO MICHAEL.

161
00:06:25,718 --> 00:06:27,678
- GET OUT OF OUR 
[bleep] TREE.

162
00:06:27,678 --> 00:06:31,181
- AT THIS MOMENT, MAEBY FOUND 
ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY TO REBEL.

163
00:06:31,181 --> 00:06:32,975
- WE HAVE TO SAVE THIS TREE.

164
00:06:32,975 --> 00:06:34,143
- WE HAVE TO!

165
00:06:34,143 --> 00:06:38,188
- AND GEORGE SR. WAS ABOUT TO BE 
SURPRISED BY HIS SON.

166
00:06:38,188 --> 00:06:40,190
- KEEP YOUR ARM UP. 
THAT'S HOW YOU GET ACCURACY.

167
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:41,191
- THOUGHT YOU SAID

168
00:06:41,191 --> 00:06:43,277
THROWING THE BALL AGAINST THE 
GARAGE DOOR BY YOURSELF

169
00:06:43,277 --> 00:06:44,987
WAS HOW YOU GOT 
ACCURACY.

170
00:06:44,987 --> 00:06:46,155
- GOB, 
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

171
00:06:46,155 --> 00:06:47,948
- LIFE, DAD. 
I KILLED A GUY.

172
00:06:49,867 --> 00:06:51,201
NAH, IT'S JUST 
A PUBLICITY STUNT.

173
00:06:51,201 --> 00:06:53,287
I'M GONNA BUST OUT TOMORROW.

174
00:06:53,287 --> 00:06:54,622
IMPRESSIVE, NO?

175
00:06:54,622 --> 00:06:56,123
- YOU IDIOT. YOU'RE GONNA 
GET YOURSELF KILLED.

176
00:06:56,123 --> 00:06:57,124
- OH, I'M SORRY.

177
00:06:57,124 --> 00:06:59,877
I DIDN'T REALIZE THERE 
WEREN'T ANY MAGIC FANS HERE.

178
00:06:59,877 --> 00:07:01,546
- HEY, WHITE POWER BILL, 
HE'S ALL RIGHT.

179
00:07:01,546 --> 00:07:04,173
- WHITE POWER BILL 
CAN'T HEAR YOU

180
00:07:04,173 --> 00:07:06,592
WITH SUCH DIRTY EARS.

181
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:08,678
- HEY, WHITE POWER BILL 
HAS DIRTY EARS.

182
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:10,012
HEY, GUYS!

183
00:07:10,012 --> 00:07:12,848
DIRTY EARS BILL! 
DIRTY EARS BILL!

184
00:07:12,848 --> 00:07:16,143
- AND MICHAEL WAS ABOUT TO GET 
A SURPRISE VISIT OF HIS OWN.

185
00:07:16,143 --> 00:07:18,896
[doorbell rings] 
[glass shatters]

186
00:07:21,524 --> 00:07:23,150
- MICHAEL?

187
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:26,236
- YES? HI. I'M MICHAEL.

188
00:07:26,236 --> 00:07:28,698
- I'M MARTA.

189
00:07:30,032 --> 00:07:32,034
- YOU'RE MARTA?

190
00:07:32,034 --> 00:07:34,119
- THANK YOU SO MUCH 
FOR TAKING ME TO THE AWARDS.

191
00:07:34,119 --> 00:07:36,456
GOB SAID HE REALLY APPRECIATED 
YOU COMING THROUGH FOR HIM.

192
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:38,458
- OH. SURE. YEAH.

193
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:41,043
THIS IS HOW 
I CAME THROUGH, HUH?

194
00:07:41,043 --> 00:07:42,628
LISTEN, MARTA--

195
00:07:42,628 --> 00:07:44,379
- OH, AND I HOPE 
YOU DON'T MIND DRIVING.

196
00:07:44,379 --> 00:07:45,631
I TOOK A CAB HERE.

197
00:07:45,631 --> 00:07:47,174
I JUST COULDN'T FIND MY KEYS.

198
00:07:47,174 --> 00:07:48,759
- WELL, MY BROTHER 
MAY HAVE EATEN THEM.

199
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:50,886
- [chuckles] 
- LOOK--

200
00:07:53,889 --> 00:07:57,810
UM...I HAVEN'T HIRED 
A LIMO OR ANYTHING.

201
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:59,436
- I DON'T MIND.

202
00:07:59,436 --> 00:08:01,689
- I THINK YOU MIGHT.

203
00:08:01,689 --> 00:08:05,985
- [singing] 
TOUCH OF MY FINGERS

204
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:08,863
WE'RE LIVIN' 
IN YOUR WORLD NOW

205
00:08:08,863 --> 00:08:11,031
THIS TIME 
I'M GONNA BE DIFFERENT

206
00:08:11,031 --> 00:08:12,324
- I'M AN ACTIVIST TOO.

207
00:08:12,324 --> 00:08:14,577
I APPRECIATE WHAT YOU'RE 
DOING FOR THE ENVIRONMENT.

208
00:08:14,577 --> 00:08:17,287
BUT WE'RE NOT THE ONLY ONES 
WHO DESTROY TREES.

209
00:08:17,287 --> 00:08:18,498
WHAT ABOUT BEAVERS?

210
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:20,249
YOU CALL YOURSELF 
AN ENVIRONMENTALIST?

211
00:08:20,249 --> 00:08:22,167
WHY DON'T YOU 
GO OUT AND CLUB SOME BEAVERS?

212
00:08:22,167 --> 00:08:26,421
- YOU DON'T REALLY 
GET NATURE, DO YA?

213
00:08:26,421 --> 00:08:29,424
- IT WILL BE TORN DOWN, 
WITH OR WITHOUT YOU.

214
00:08:30,843 --> 00:08:32,427
WHERE ARE THE STAIRS?

215
00:08:32,427 --> 00:08:35,515
- MEANWHILE, THE DESIS 
WERE UNDERWAY.

216
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:37,850
- [speaking Spanish]

217
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:40,269
GUILLERMO ORTIZ 
COMO EL RATON,

218
00:08:40,269 --> 00:08:42,563
PABLO DOMINGUEZ 
COMO PEPITO,

219
00:08:42,563 --> 00:08:45,274
FELICIO COLO 
COMO MIGUELITO--

220
00:08:45,274 --> 00:08:46,275
- AND LUCILLE WAS MINGLING

221
00:08:46,275 --> 00:08:48,778
WITH THE ELITE OF 
THE LATINO TELEVISION ACADEMY.

222
00:08:48,778 --> 00:08:50,863
- CAN I GET 
A VODKA TONIC, PLEASE?

223
00:08:50,863 --> 00:08:52,698
I'D LIKE A VODKA TONIC, PLEASE.

224
00:08:52,698 --> 00:08:54,700
VODKA TONIC, PLEASE?

225
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:57,411
A SEA OF WAITERS, AND NO ONE 
WILL TAKE A DRINK ORDER.

226
00:08:57,411 --> 00:08:59,454
- BUSTER WAS ALSO MINGLING,

227
00:08:59,454 --> 00:09:02,416
BUT, AT LUCILLE'S INSISTENCE, 
WASN'T WEARING HIS GLASSES.

228
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:03,458
- COMO ESTOY?

229
00:09:07,087 --> 00:09:09,464
EXCITING NIGHT.

230
00:09:09,464 --> 00:09:11,508
[chuckles]

231
00:09:11,508 --> 00:09:15,512
- AND LUCILLE BLUTH CROSSED 
PATHS WITH LUCILLE AUSTERO.

232
00:09:17,682 --> 00:09:19,349
- LUCILLE?

233
00:09:19,349 --> 00:09:21,185
LUCILLE!

234
00:09:21,185 --> 00:09:23,187
WELL, AREN'T YOU SOMETHING? 
- OH!

235
00:09:23,187 --> 00:09:25,690
- SHOWING UP HERE 
WITHOUT YOUR HUSBAND.

236
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:28,358
SHAME BE DAMNED. 
CAUTION TO THE WIND.

237
00:09:28,358 --> 00:09:29,359
THAT'S JUST INCREDIBLE.

238
00:09:29,359 --> 00:09:31,862
- THAT'S SO SWEET, DARLING. 
I'M HERE TO SUPPORT YOU.

239
00:09:31,862 --> 00:09:34,907
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO'S ALL ALONE 
AND LIKELY TO STAY THAT WAY.

240
00:09:34,907 --> 00:09:37,534
MY HUSBAND'S 
JUST A PHONE CALL AWAY.

241
00:09:37,534 --> 00:09:40,580
- THAT'S ONE CALL PER DAY, 
ISN'T IT?

242
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:43,708
GEE, I SHOULD THINK HE'D WANNA 
SAVE THAT FOR HIS LAWYER.

243
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:46,711
- AT LEAST HE'S IN PRISON, 
NOT AN URN.

244
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:52,216
- YOU ARE SO 
DELICIOUSLY WITTY.

245
00:09:52,216 --> 00:09:54,051
- AREN'T WE HAVING FUN?

246
00:09:54,051 --> 00:09:58,305
- THE OTHER LUCILLE ALSO SUFFERS 
FROM SEVERE VERTIGO.

247
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:03,393
- [singing] I'LL

248
00:10:03,393 --> 00:10:07,064
FLY

249
00:10:07,064 --> 00:10:10,025
AWAY

250
00:10:10,025 --> 00:10:11,736
[applause]

251
00:10:14,279 --> 00:10:16,657
- LUCILLE AUSTERO, MEANWHILE,

252
00:10:16,657 --> 00:10:19,702
PERHAPS BECAUSE SHE'D NEVER SEEN 
HIM WITHOUT HIS GLASSES,

253
00:10:19,702 --> 00:10:21,662
FIRST TOOK NOTICE 
OF BUSTER.

254
00:10:21,662 --> 00:10:23,873
[Latin pop]

255
00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:27,251
- [giggles]

256
00:10:28,794 --> 00:10:32,923
- BUSTER, HOWEVER, 
FAILED TO NOTICE HER,

257
00:10:34,049 --> 00:10:36,176
AND SHE SENT HIM 
A PROPOSITION.

258
00:10:36,176 --> 00:10:39,388
- EXCUSE ME, SIR. 
THIS IS FOR YOU.

259
00:10:39,179 --> 00:10:40,931
- [giggles]

260
00:10:40,931 --> 00:10:44,601
- [singing] I CAN'T SEE 
ANYTHING BUT LOVE

261
00:10:44,601 --> 00:10:46,937
- HUH?

262
00:10:46,937 --> 00:10:49,231
- FINALLY, MARTA'S CATEGORY 
WAS ANNOUNCED.

263
00:10:49,231 --> 00:10:50,274
- Y EL DESI VA A...

264
00:10:51,066 --> 00:10:52,151
[drumroll]

265
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:55,070
SANDRA ELENA HIGUERA.

266
00:10:55,070 --> 00:10:57,489
[fanfare]

267
00:11:03,871 --> 00:11:05,455
[orchestra continues]

268
00:11:05,455 --> 00:11:06,456
- MARTA?

269
00:11:06,456 --> 00:11:08,208
HEY.

270
00:11:08,208 --> 00:11:09,459
I'M SORRY.

271
00:11:09,459 --> 00:11:11,253
YOU REALLY DESERVED 
TO WIN IN THERE.

272
00:11:13,463 --> 00:11:16,050
DID YOU WIN? 
I-I DON'T SPEAK SPANISH.

273
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:18,218
- IT'S NOT ABOUT THE AWARD.

274
00:11:18,218 --> 00:11:21,388
IT'S CRAZY, BUT I THOUGHT 
IT WOULD MAKE GOB PROUD.

275
00:11:21,388 --> 00:11:23,390
- I'M SURE, IN HIS OWN WAY, 
THAT HE'S--

276
00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:26,643
- YOU KNOW, I JUST THINK 
HE DOESN'T UNDERSTAND FAMILY,

277
00:11:26,643 --> 00:11:28,145
YOU KNOW, COMMITMENT.

278
00:11:28,145 --> 00:11:31,774
BUT THOSE ARE THE ONLY THINGS 
THAT MATTER IN LIFE.

279
00:11:31,774 --> 00:11:34,693
- AT THAT MOMENT MICHAEL 
REALIZED THAT THIS WAS

280
00:11:34,693 --> 00:11:37,112
THE MOST BEAUTIFUL WOMAN 
HE'D EVER SEEN.

281
00:11:37,112 --> 00:11:40,532
AND FOR THE FIRST TIME 
SINCE HE LOST HIS WIFE,

282
00:11:40,532 --> 00:11:41,533
HE WANTED SOMEONE.

283
00:11:41,533 --> 00:11:43,577
- [singing] TOUCH OF MY FINGERS

284
00:11:43,577 --> 00:11:45,871
- [laughs]

285
00:11:45,871 --> 00:11:47,832
- [singing] WE'RE LIVIN' 
IN YOUR WORLD NOW

286
00:11:47,832 --> 00:11:48,833
- AT THE SAME MOMENT,

287
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:52,044
GOB WAS READY TO RETRIEVE 
THE KEY TO EXECUTE HIS ESCAPE.

288
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:54,671
- IS THERE 
A PRIVATE BATHROOM NEARBY?

289
00:11:54,671 --> 00:11:56,506
[clang]

290
00:11:56,506 --> 00:11:57,716
- YOU'RE LOOKING AT IT.

291
00:11:57,716 --> 00:11:59,509
- NO, NO, I CAN'T USE THAT.

292
00:11:59,509 --> 00:12:00,510
NO, NO, I NEED PRIVACY.

293
00:12:00,510 --> 00:12:03,764
YEAH, NO, 
I'VE ALWAYS BEEN THAT WAY.

294
00:12:03,764 --> 00:12:05,557
I CAN'T GO 
WITHOUT PRIVACY.

295
00:12:05,557 --> 00:12:07,852
I C--I CAN'T PASS THIS KEY 
WITHOUT PRIVACY!

296
00:12:07,852 --> 00:12:10,520
- WELL, I COULD ASK THE GUYS 
TO LEAVE, BUT, UH,

297
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:12,564
THEY'VE, YOU KNOW, BEEN 
LOCKING THE DOORS LATELY.

298
00:12:12,564 --> 00:12:14,441
I--

299
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:18,028
- I'VE MADE 
A HUGE MISTAKE.

300
00:12:21,323 --> 00:12:23,575
- MICHAEL WAS HAVING 
A WONDERFUL TIME WITH MARTA

301
00:12:23,575 --> 00:12:26,245
AND DIDN'T WANT 
THE EVENING TO END,

302
00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:29,289
WHILE LINDSAY WAS BONDING 
WITH THE MAN IN THE TREE.

303
00:12:29,289 --> 00:12:32,167
- YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT IT'S 
LIKE TO SAVE A LIVING THING.

304
00:12:32,167 --> 00:12:34,544
- WELL, FOR YOUR INFORMATION, 
I DO.

305
00:12:34,544 --> 00:12:35,545
MY HUSBAND, TOBIAS, AND I

306
00:12:35,545 --> 00:12:38,548
USED TO DO THIS KIND OF THING 
ALL THE TIME.

307
00:12:38,548 --> 00:12:41,635
I GUESS THAT'S WHY 
I WAS SO ATTRACTED TO HIM.

308
00:12:41,635 --> 00:12:44,304
HE WAS A SERIOUS AND COMMITTED 
ADVOCATE FOR CHANGE.

309
00:12:44,304 --> 00:12:45,430
- WHERE IS HE NOW?

310
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:47,975
- HE'S AT A WEEKEND 
STAGE FIGHTING WORKSHOP

311
00:12:47,975 --> 00:12:49,184
WITH CARL WEATHERS.

312
00:12:50,602 --> 00:12:53,480
BUT HE USED TO 
BELIEVE IN THINGS.

313
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:54,481
WE BOTH USED TO.

314
00:12:54,481 --> 00:12:56,150
[door opens]

315
00:12:56,150 --> 00:13:00,821
- SORRY, LINDSAY, I DIDN'T 
REALIZE YOU WERE UP THERE.

316
00:13:00,821 --> 00:13:05,117
- OH, I'M UP HERE, MIKE, 
AND I'M NOT COMING DOWN!

317
00:13:05,117 --> 00:13:07,619
I'M GONNA SAVE THIS TREE, 
NO MATTER WHAT IT TAKES.

318
00:13:07,619 --> 00:13:11,456
- OKAY. I'LL SEE YOU WHEN YOU 
REALIZE WHAT THAT BUCKET'S FOR.

319
00:13:11,456 --> 00:13:12,833
[door closes]

320
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:14,584
- YOU KNOW, I CAN SEE 
WHY YOUR MOM LIKES IT.

321
00:13:14,584 --> 00:13:15,794
IT IS A REALLY NICE TREE.

322
00:13:15,794 --> 00:13:17,880
- WE'VE GOTTA 
GET IT TORN DOWN.

323
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:21,008
- THAT MUST DIE. 
STUPID TREE.

324
00:13:23,969 --> 00:13:24,970
- BUSTER'S OUT OF CONTROL.

325
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:26,388
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN? 
ANOTHER PANIC ATTACK?

326
00:13:26,388 --> 00:13:27,472
- ME?

327
00:13:27,472 --> 00:13:28,765
NO.

328
00:13:28,765 --> 00:13:31,018
SHE'S JUST WIGGED OUT 
BECAUSE I HAVE A GIRLFRIEND.

329
00:13:31,018 --> 00:13:34,063
- A WAITER HANDS HIM A NOTE; 
SUDDENLY HE'S STEVE McQUEEN.

330
00:13:34,063 --> 00:13:36,565
HE DOESN'T EVEN KNOW 
WHAT SHE LOOKS LIKE.

331
00:13:36,565 --> 00:13:39,109
- I KNOW SHE'S A BROWNISH AREA 
WITH POINTS.

332
00:13:40,235 --> 00:13:41,820
AND I KNOW I LOVE HER.

333
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:43,322
- I'M CALLING DR. MILLER.

334
00:13:47,451 --> 00:13:49,203
- OKAY, I DON'T KNOW 
I LOVE HER,

335
00:13:49,203 --> 00:13:51,997
BUT I CANNOT TELL YOU 
HOW LIBERATING IT IS

336
00:13:51,997 --> 00:13:54,458
TO BE WITH SOMEONE 
WHO'S NOT MOM,

337
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:56,376
WHO'S NOTHING LIKE HER.

338
00:13:56,376 --> 00:13:57,377
- YEAH, AND YOU'RE JUST--

339
00:13:57,377 --> 00:13:59,421
YOU'RE JUST JUMPING 
RIGHT INTO THIS, HUH?

340
00:13:59,421 --> 00:14:01,673
- OH, YES. YES.

341
00:14:01,673 --> 00:14:02,674
THAT'S WHAT YOU DO

342
00:14:02,674 --> 00:14:05,260
WHEN LIFE HANDS YOU A CHANCE 
TO BE WITH SOMEONE SPECIAL.

343
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:08,472
YOU JUST GRAB THAT--THAT 
BROWNISH AREA BY ITS POINTS,

344
00:14:08,472 --> 00:14:11,516
AND YOU DON'T LET GO, 
NO MATTER WHAT YOUR MOM SAYS.

345
00:14:11,516 --> 00:14:13,894
MMM!

346
00:14:16,271 --> 00:14:17,272
- GOOD TALK.

347
00:14:17,272 --> 00:14:18,648
[phone rings]

348
00:14:18,648 --> 00:14:19,649
HELLO.

349
00:14:19,649 --> 00:14:22,194
- MICHAEL. 
CHANGE OF ESCAPE PLAN.

350
00:14:22,194 --> 00:14:24,613
I UNPLUGGED 
THE ICE CREAM SANDWICH MACHINE,

351
00:14:24,613 --> 00:14:26,991
AND THE GUARDS ARE ALL EATING 
THEM BEFORE THEY GET TOO MELTY,

352
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:28,575
SO I'VE GOT 
LIKE A HALF AN HOUR.

353
00:14:28,575 --> 00:14:33,163
MEET ME AT THE SOUTH PRISON WALL 
AND BRING THE STAIRS.

354
00:14:33,163 --> 00:14:38,668
- MICHAEL KNEW HE HAD 
AN OBLIGATION TO HIS BROTHER.

355
00:14:38,668 --> 00:14:39,879
- [whispering] 
MICHAEL!

356
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:42,672
- HEY, GOB!

357
00:14:42,672 --> 00:14:44,758
- WHERE THE HELL 
ARE THE STAIRS?

358
00:14:44,758 --> 00:14:46,969
- OH! 
I THOUGHT YOU WERE KIDDING!

359
00:14:46,969 --> 00:14:48,929
HEY, SPEAKING OF KIDDING,

360
00:14:48,929 --> 00:14:52,141
HOW SERIOUS ARE YOU 
ABOUT MARTA?

361
00:14:52,141 --> 00:14:54,309
I GET THE SENSE THAT THERE'S 
NOT MUCH OF A FUTURE THERE.

362
00:14:54,309 --> 00:14:55,685
AM I READING THAT RIGHT?

363
00:14:55,685 --> 00:14:56,686
- LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHING.

364
00:14:56,686 --> 00:14:59,773
HOW WOULD YOU FEEL IF I 
CAME DOWN ON YOU HARD?

365
00:14:59,773 --> 00:15:02,192
- YOU'RE SAYING 
I'M NOT READING THIS RIGHT.

366
00:15:02,192 --> 00:15:03,652
- NO, I'M SAYING MOVE THE BIKE.

367
00:15:03,652 --> 00:15:05,112
I NEED TO JUMP ON YOU 
TO BREAK MY FALL.

368
00:15:05,112 --> 00:15:06,113
- DON'T BE AN IDIOT.

369
00:15:06,113 --> 00:15:07,197
DON'T JUMP ON ME.

370
00:15:07,197 --> 00:15:08,740
- NO, I HAVE TO! 
COME ON. STOP MOVING!

371
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:09,783
- COME ON! 
DON'T JUMP ON ME!

372
00:15:09,783 --> 00:15:10,910
- COME ON. 
STOP MOVING!

373
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:12,953
- THE GUARDS SOON BECAME 
CONCERNED

374
00:15:12,953 --> 00:15:14,955
ABOUT THE PAPERWORK 
THAT WOULD BE REQUIRED OF THEM

375
00:15:14,955 --> 00:15:16,706
IF GOB ACTUALLY DID JUMP.

376
00:15:16,706 --> 00:15:17,917
- DON'T BE SUCH A MORON!

377
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:19,960
- YOU'RE MAKING THIS 
VERY, VERY DIFFICULT.

378
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:20,961
[electric zap]

379
00:15:20,961 --> 00:15:22,004
OHH! GOD!

380
00:15:22,004 --> 00:15:23,880
THIS IS PERSONAL--

381
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:24,023
- GOB.

382
00:15:24,023 --> 00:15:27,051
GOB!

383
00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:29,303
GOOD TALK.

384
00:15:32,681 --> 00:15:36,060
- I'M A COMPLETE FAILURE.

385
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:38,312
- WHERE'D YOU GET 
THAT KIND OF TALK?

386
00:15:38,312 --> 00:15:39,313
- FROM YOU.

387
00:15:39,313 --> 00:15:43,192
YOU ALWAYS SAY THAT 
ABOUT ME.

388
00:15:43,192 --> 00:15:45,610
- WELL, MAYBE YOU'RE NOT 
ENTIRELY TO BLAME.

389
00:15:45,610 --> 00:15:48,238
I HAVEN'T ALWAYS BEEN 
THE BEST KIND OF FATHER EITHER.

390
00:15:48,238 --> 00:15:50,365
- YOU'VE DONE A PRETTY GOOD JOB 
OF BEING A FATHER

391
00:15:50,365 --> 00:15:52,576
TO EVERYBODY IN HERE.

392
00:15:52,576 --> 00:15:54,911
WHAT HAVE THEY GOT 
THAT I DON'T?

393
00:15:54,911 --> 00:15:59,041
YOU'VE NEVER EVEN...THROWN A 
BALL AROUND WITH ME.

394
00:16:00,375 --> 00:16:03,212
- GREAT. 
NOW YOU'RE AN ATHLETE.

395
00:16:03,212 --> 00:16:05,214
[sighs]

396
00:16:07,549 --> 00:16:08,758
- [snoring]

397
00:16:08,758 --> 00:16:12,721
- LINDSAY LEFT THE TREE 
TO SLEEP IN HER OWN BED,

398
00:16:12,721 --> 00:16:15,182
AND JOHNNY BARK LEFT THE TREE 
TO AWAKEN HER.

399
00:16:15,182 --> 00:16:17,726
- SO, LINDSAY, I WAS THINKING-- 
- JOHNNY BARK?

400
00:16:17,726 --> 00:16:18,893
- I WANNA BE WITH YOU, 
LINDSAY.

401
00:16:18,893 --> 00:16:19,728
- WHAT?

402
00:16:19,728 --> 00:16:21,146
- AND I KNOW YOU WANNA 
BE WITH ME TOO.

403
00:16:21,146 --> 00:16:22,397
- NO, I DON'T.

404
00:16:22,397 --> 00:16:24,191
- BUT ALL THE THINGS 
YOU SAID ABOUT COMMITMENT

405
00:16:24,191 --> 00:16:26,526
AND BELIEVING IN THINGS--

406
00:16:26,526 --> 00:16:28,237
THAT'S THE WAY I FEEL!

407
00:16:28,237 --> 00:16:31,740
- JOHNNY, I'M SORRY. I-- 
I DIDN'T MEAN TO LEAD YOU ON.

408
00:16:32,907 --> 00:16:34,534
I THINK YOU'RE GROSS.

409
00:16:34,534 --> 00:16:35,744
[tree falls]

410
00:16:35,744 --> 00:16:39,373
- UH-OH. 
- MY TREE.

411
00:16:41,541 --> 00:16:44,003
THAT'S WHY YOU NEVER 
GET OUT OF THE TREE.

412
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:47,589
- AND GOB WAS ABOUT TO GET A 
REASON TO STAY IN PRISON.

413
00:16:47,589 --> 00:16:49,883
[rock music]

414
00:16:49,883 --> 00:16:51,885
- YOU ALL RIGHT?

415
00:16:51,885 --> 00:16:52,886
- NOT GREAT.

416
00:16:52,886 --> 00:16:54,054
- [singing] A MOMENT OF STEEL

417
00:16:54,054 --> 00:16:55,264
A DRY-EYED HOUSE

418
00:16:55,264 --> 00:16:57,432
- MAYBE THIS'LL HELP.

419
00:16:57,432 --> 00:16:59,434
- AND FOR THE FIRST TIME,

420
00:16:59,434 --> 00:17:01,020
GOB HAD THE GAME OF CATCH 
WITH HIS FATHER

421
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:03,147
HE'D BEEN WAITING FOR 
HIS WHOLE LIFE.

422
00:17:03,147 --> 00:17:05,690
- OKAY, READY? 
PUT YOUR MITT UP.

- [singing] CRY LOVE

427
00:17:11,738 --> 00:17:12,864
- WHITE POWER!

00:17:12,864 --> 00:17:15,534
- [groaning] 
I'M...WHITE.

429
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:18,078
- AND MICHAEL DECIDED TO 
SHARE HIS FEELINGS WITH MARTA.

430
00:17:18,078 --> 00:17:19,996
- MICHAEL. 
- MARTA.

431
00:17:19,996 --> 00:17:23,458
I'M NOT REALLY QUITE SURE 
HOW TO SAY THIS, BUT, UM--

432
00:17:23,458 --> 00:17:24,876
[phone ringing]

433
00:17:24,876 --> 00:17:26,128
I HAD A GREAT TIME 
LAST NIGHT.

434
00:17:26,128 --> 00:17:26,878
- I DID TOO.

435
00:17:26,878 --> 00:17:28,047
- AND, UM...

436
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:29,256
[phone continues ringing]

437
00:17:29,256 --> 00:17:31,425
WE'RE SO IN SYNCH 
ON SO MANY THINGS,

438
00:17:31,425 --> 00:17:33,510
AND, UH, I-I--

439
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:35,095
[phone continues ringing]

440
00:17:35,095 --> 00:17:36,805
[sighs) YOU GUYS DON'T HAVE 
A MACHINE, HUH?

441
00:17:36,805 --> 00:17:38,014
- SORRY. [giggling]

442
00:17:38,014 --> 00:17:39,974
- OKAY.

443
00:17:39,974 --> 00:17:41,768
- HELLO.

444
00:17:41,768 --> 00:17:43,853
OH, MY GOD.

445
00:17:43,853 --> 00:17:45,314
GOB HAS BEEN 
STABBED IN THE BACK.

446
00:17:53,363 --> 00:17:54,989
- AM I STILL IN PRISON?

447
00:17:54,989 --> 00:17:57,451
- YOU'RE IN THE HOSPITAL.

448
00:17:58,785 --> 00:17:59,178
- TA-DAH.

449
00:17:59,178 --> 00:18:02,581
- MEANWHILE, BUSTER 
WAS WAITING IN THE HALLWAY.

450
00:18:02,581 --> 00:18:03,748
- BUSTER?

451
00:18:03,748 --> 00:18:06,751
- OH, MISS AUSTERO.

452
00:18:06,751 --> 00:18:08,920
WH-WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

453
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:10,422
- A TOUCH OF THE DIZZIES.

455
00:18:11,715 --> 00:18:12,716

ALWAYS BEEN THAT POINTY, 
MISS AUSTERO?

00:18:48,335 --> 00:18:52,214
- HE'S FINE. 
I'LL BE IN THE HOSPITAL BAR.

470
00:18:52,214 --> 00:18:54,841
- UH, YOU KNOW, THERE ISN'T 
A HOSPITAL BAR, MOTHER.

471
00:18:54,841 --> 00:18:58,595

LIFE IS TOO SHORT.

476
00:19:12,609 --> 00:19:13,943

SO I THINK I'M GONNA 
WORK THINGS OUT WITH MARTA.

I WAS GONNA WALK OUT 
OF THAT PRISON LAST NIGHT

00:19:35,382 --> 00:19:36,758
AND BREAK UP WITH HER.

I'M GONNA 
START GETTING JEALOUS.

TO WORRY ABOUT.

WE'RE GONNA BE TOGETHER 
FOR A LONG TIME.

00:20:42,866 --> 00:20:43,867
CRY LOVE

510
00:20:43,867 --> 00:20:46,119
- ON THE NEXT 
"ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT,"

511
00:20:46,119 --> 00:20:48,247
GOB LEARNS HOW HE SURVIVED 
HIS STABBING.

512
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:50,290
- LOOKS LIKE THE SHIV WOULD HAVE 
DONE SOME REAL DAMAGE

513
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:51,625
IF IT HADN'T BEEN FOR THIS.

514
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:54,210
IT WAS IN 
YOUR LOWER INTESTINE.

515
00:20:54,210 --> 00:20:56,212
- SO CLOSE.

516
00:20:56,212 --> 00:20:58,257
- AND BUSTER 
MAKES A BOLD MOVE.

517
00:20:58,257 --> 00:21:00,259
[knocking]

518
00:21:02,302 --> 00:21:03,177
- BUSTER.

519
00:21:03,177 --> 00:21:04,554
- LET'S GO FOR IT.
