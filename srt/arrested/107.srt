00:00:01,434 --> 00:00:02,735
narrator: NOW THE STORY 
OF A WEALTHY FAMILY

2
00:00:02,735 --> 00:00:03,769
WHO LOST EVERYTHING...

3
00:00:03,769 --> 00:00:05,838
AND THE ONE SON 
WHO HAD NO CHOICE...

4
00:00:05,838 --> 00:00:07,873
BUT TO KEEP THEM ALL TOGETHER.

5
00:00:13,379 --> 00:00:15,081
IT'S ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT.

6
00:00:18,684 --> 00:00:20,686
MICHAEL BLUTH 
HAD CALLED A MEETING...

7
00:00:20,686 --> 00:00:22,722
WITH THE FAMILY'S 
LONGTIME ATTORNEY...

8
00:00:22,722 --> 00:00:25,024
TO DISCUSS 
HIS FATHER'S INCARCERATION.

9
00:00:25,024 --> 00:00:29,795
- I AM SO SORRY. 
IT WAS A CLIENT. OKAY.

10
00:00:29,795 --> 00:00:32,398
- BUT HE WAS FINDING IT 
DIFFICULT TO GET ANY ANSWERS.

11
00:00:32,398 --> 00:00:33,466
- HOW LONG 
WAS I ON THE PHONE?

12
00:00:33,466 --> 00:00:35,468
- TWENTY-FIVE MINUTES.

13
00:00:35,468 --> 00:00:36,569
- WITH THE CELL PHONE CHARGES,

14
00:00:36,569 --> 00:00:38,771
I'M GONNA ROUND IT OUT 
TO ABOUT AN HOUR...

15
00:00:38,771 --> 00:00:41,641
'CAUSE IT'S EASIER TO BILL-- 
ALL RIGHT.

16
00:00:41,641 --> 00:00:42,642
ANYTHING ELSE TO GO OVER?

17
00:00:42,642 --> 00:00:44,977
- WE'VE GOT 
EVERYTHING ELSE TO GO OVER.

18
00:00:44,977 --> 00:00:48,614
WE HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING 
TO GET MY DAD OUT OF JAIL.

19
00:00:48,614 --> 00:00:53,619
- OKAY. FIRST OF ALL-- WHAT ARE 
YOU DOING? PILATES?

20
00:00:53,619 --> 00:00:57,157
BECAUSE NO 40-YEAR-OLD WOMAN 
SHOULD LOOK LIKE THAT.

21
00:00:57,157 --> 00:00:59,859
- WELL, NO 40-YEAR-OLD WOMAN 
DOES LOOK LIKE THAT.

22
00:00:59,859 --> 00:01:02,828
narrator: HE WAS, HOWEVER, 
GETTING ALONG WITH HIS SISTER,

23
00:01:02,828 --> 00:01:05,131
WHICH WAS UNWELCOME NEWS 
TO THEIR MOTHER,

24
00:01:05,131 --> 00:01:07,600
WHO FEARED THIS UNITY 
MIGHT BE USED AGAINST HER.

25
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,102
- I DO HAVE SOME BIG NEWS.

26
00:01:09,102 --> 00:01:10,470
IT'S GOING TO COST YOU 
A LITTLE MONEY--

27
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:11,904
20,000, 
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

28
00:01:11,904 --> 00:01:16,742
THE COURTS HAVE AGREED TO LET 
YOUR FATHER OUT OF PRISON.

29
00:01:16,742 --> 00:01:18,311
- THIS IS A LAWYER! 
- HE'S A MASTER!

30
00:01:18,311 --> 00:01:20,513
- FOR THE ENTIRE AFTERNOON.

31
00:01:20,513 --> 00:01:23,083
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN "AFTERNOON"? 
WHAT AFTERNOON?

32
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:24,083
- THE DAY BEFORE CHRISTMAS,

33
00:01:24,083 --> 00:01:26,486
IN TIME FOR THE 
LIVING CLASSICS PAGEANT,

34
00:01:26,486 --> 00:01:28,754
BECAUSE I KNOW HOW IMPORTANT 
THAT IS TO ALL OF YOU.

35
00:01:28,754 --> 00:01:30,323
narrator: 
THE LIVING CLASSICS PAGEANT,

36
00:01:30,323 --> 00:01:31,324
AN ORANGE COUNTY TRADITION,

37
00:01:31,324 --> 00:01:34,960
CONSISTS OF LIVE REPRESENTATIONS 
OF CLASSIC WORKS OF ART.

38
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,296
THE BLUTH FAMILY HAS 
PARTICIPATED

39
00:01:36,296 --> 00:01:37,763
NOT ONLY AS A PATRON,

40
00:01:37,763 --> 00:01:41,066
BUT AS AN INTEGRAL PART 
OF ITS MOST POPULAR EXHIBIT,

41
00:01:41,066 --> 00:01:44,804
MICHELANGELO'S 
THE CREATION OF ADAM.

42
00:01:44,804 --> 00:01:47,072
- I DON'T REALLY WANT 
TO BE ADAM THIS YEAR.

43
00:01:47,072 --> 00:01:49,509
- WELL, IF YOU WANT TO PLAY EVE, 
YOU GOT TO GET IN LINE...

44
00:01:49,509 --> 00:01:52,011
BEHIND, WHAT, 
ABOUT FIVE HOMOS.

45
00:01:54,046 --> 00:01:57,183
THAT WAS WRONG. 
I'M--I'M SO SORRY.

46
00:01:57,183 --> 00:01:59,619
IT'S JUST THAT I HAVE ONE 
DOWN AT THE OFFICE NOW,

47
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:01,821
AND, I MEAN, 
IT IS EVERY DAY.

48
00:02:01,821 --> 00:02:05,725
- I WOULD BE HAPPY TO PLAY ADAM. 
I'D PREFER A SPEAKING PART--

49
00:02:05,725 --> 00:02:07,627
- PLEASE DON'T SPEAK FOR 
THE REST OF THE MEETING.

50
00:02:07,627 --> 00:02:08,861
- [chuckles]

51
00:02:08,861 --> 00:02:09,862
ZING!

52
00:02:09,862 --> 00:02:11,931
- NO, NO, SERIOUSLY. 
I DON'T WANT TO PLAY ADAM.

53
00:02:11,931 --> 00:02:14,467
- BUSTER, EVERY YEAR WE GO 
THROUGH THIS SONG AND DANCE,

54
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:15,468
AND EVERY YEAR YOU SAY,

55
00:02:15,468 --> 00:02:19,139
"THANK YOU, MAMA, 
FOR MAKING ME PLAY ADAM."

56
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:20,140
YOU'RE DOING IT.

57
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:22,041
narrator: 
THIS CONCERNED BUSTER...

58
00:02:22,041 --> 00:02:24,477
AS HE'D BEEN SECRETLY DATING 
HIS MOTHER'S BEST FRIEND...

59
00:02:24,477 --> 00:02:27,547
AND CHIEF SOCIAL RIVAL, 
LUCILLE AUSTERO.

60
00:02:27,547 --> 00:02:30,150
- CAN'T WE JUST STAY HERE 
AND PLAY POKER AGAIN?

61
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,451
YOU CAN BET YOUR VERTIGO 
MEDICINE

62
00:02:31,451 --> 00:02:32,652
AGAINST MY ANXIETY PILLS.

63
00:02:32,652 --> 00:02:36,356
- NO. BUSTER, FOR GOD'S SAKE, 
THERE IS MUSIC TO HEAR,

64
00:02:36,356 --> 00:02:38,991
PLACES TO GO, 
ENVY TO STIR.

65
00:02:38,991 --> 00:02:41,894
LOOK, I'M TIRED OF KEEPING 
OUR LOVE A SECRET.

66
00:02:41,894 --> 00:02:44,597
WE ARE GOING OUT, 
AND THAT IS THAT!

67
00:02:44,597 --> 00:02:47,700
- OH. 
- OH, BUSTER. OKAY, I'M OKAY.

68
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:49,635
I'M OKAY.

69
00:02:49,635 --> 00:02:51,671
- OKAY. I'M GONNA 
GET OUT OF YOUR HAIR.

70
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:53,105
WE'LL TALK ABOUT THIS MONEY 
LATER IN THE WEEK.

71
00:02:53,105 --> 00:02:54,106
- EXCUSE ME.

72
00:02:54,106 --> 00:02:55,174
WE'RE NOT GOING TO PAY 
$20,000

73
00:02:55,174 --> 00:02:56,942
TO GET MY DAD OUT 
FOR ONE DAY.

74
00:02:56,942 --> 00:02:57,943
- NO. IT'S A BOND.

75
00:02:57,943 --> 00:03:00,413
IT'S ALL REFUNDABLE, 
UNLIKE MY TIME.

76
00:03:00,413 --> 00:03:02,448
- IT'S BEEN A COMPLETE WASTE 
OF TWO HOURS, OKAY?

77
00:03:02,448 --> 00:03:04,484
WE'RE JUST NOT GOING TO DO IT, 
AND THAT'S THAT.

78
00:03:04,484 --> 00:03:05,485
ARE YOU WRITING TWO HOURS?

79
00:03:05,485 --> 00:03:07,720
- NO, I'M TAKING NOTES 
ON THE CASE.

80
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,121
- LET ME JUST SEE 
WHAT YOU JUST WROTE.

81
00:03:09,121 --> 00:03:10,122
- YOU'RE SCARING ME.

82
00:03:10,122 --> 00:03:12,258
JUST LEAVE IT ALONE! 
IT IS A GIFT FROM A CLIENT!

83
00:03:12,258 --> 00:03:13,259
[door slams]

84
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:17,630
- BARRY'S VERY GOOD. 
- HE'S AN IDIOT.

85
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:19,599
- EXACTLY. WE'RE NOT TRYING 
TO GET DAD OUT FOR A NIGHT.

86
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:21,567
WE'RE TRYING 
TO GET HIM OUT FOR GOOD.

87
00:03:21,567 --> 00:03:22,668
WE'RE GONNA GET A NEW LAWYER.

88
00:03:22,668 --> 00:03:24,203
I ACTUALLY KNOW OF ONE 
WHO'S AVAILABLE.

89
00:03:24,203 --> 00:03:26,205
HIS NAME'S WAYNE JARVIS. 
HE'S A TOP GUY.

90
00:03:26,205 --> 00:03:27,707
narrator: WAYNE JARVIS 
HAD BECOME FAMOUS...

91
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:29,509
AFTER AN EMPLOYMENT 
DISCRIMINATION SUIT...

92
00:03:29,509 --> 00:03:31,110
AGAINST THE FAMILY'S 
CURRENT ATTORNEY,

93
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:32,545
BARRY ZUCKERKORN.

94
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:34,314
- IT'LL BE A LONG TIME 
BEFORE BARRY ZUCKERKORN

95
00:03:34,314 --> 00:03:36,616
CALLS ANYONE A HOMO AGAIN.

96
00:03:36,616 --> 00:03:39,419
- YOU KNOW, I AM REALLY HAPPY 
THAT YOU TWO ARE IN AGREEMENT,

97
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:41,621
BUT WE'RE NOT 
GETTING RID OF BARRY.

98
00:03:41,621 --> 00:03:44,757
HE'S LIKE FAMILY, 
AND YOU CAN'T FIRE FAMILY.

99
00:03:44,757 --> 00:03:47,793
- YEAH, I KNOW. 
HEY, MAEBY.

100
00:03:47,793 --> 00:03:50,263
- MAEBY, 
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?

101
00:03:50,263 --> 00:03:51,264
- YOU LEFT ME AT HOME.

102
00:03:51,264 --> 00:03:53,699
YOU DO REMEMBER YOU HAVE 
A DAUGHTER, RIGHT?

103
00:03:53,699 --> 00:03:55,868
- UH, YES, 
OF COURSE WE REMEMBER,

104
00:03:55,868 --> 00:03:57,870
AND WE WERE WORRIED SICK, 
YOUNG LADY.

105
00:03:57,870 --> 00:03:58,871
SHE'S FINE.

106
00:03:58,871 --> 00:04:02,542
OUR DAUGHTER'S ALL RIGHT, 
EVERYBODY, SO--

107
00:04:02,542 --> 00:04:03,976
YOU SAID YOU DIDN'T 
WANT HER TO COME.

108
00:04:03,976 --> 00:04:05,611
- I DIDN'T WANT YOU TO COME.

109
00:04:05,611 --> 00:04:06,612
- OH, THAT MAKES MORE SENSE.

110
00:04:06,612 --> 00:04:09,415
- NOW SHE'S GOING TO THINK 
WE'RE TOTALLY SELF-INVOLVED.

111
00:04:09,415 --> 00:04:10,416
- I CAN FIX THIS.

112
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:12,652
BUSTER'S PROBABLY 
STILL IN THE LOBBY.

113
00:04:12,652 --> 00:04:15,755
LET ME GO SEE IF I CAN'T GET HIM 
TO GIVE ME THE PART OF ADAM.

114
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:17,557
- AND I'LL SEE IF I CAN 
GET SOME MONEY FROM MY MOM.

115
00:04:17,557 --> 00:04:18,558
- LUPE!

116
00:04:18,558 --> 00:04:20,593
THERE ARE SOME JUICE GLASSES 
ON THE SOFA TABLE.

117
00:04:20,593 --> 00:04:22,662
- MAMA, I'LL HELP YOU CLEAN UP.

118
00:04:22,662 --> 00:04:24,597
THERE ARE SOME SALAD PLATES 
ON THE PIANO.

119
00:04:24,597 --> 00:04:25,598
WOW. 
WHAT A PARTY.

120
00:04:25,598 --> 00:04:27,567
YOU MAKE IT SEEM 
SO EFFORTLESS.

121
00:04:27,567 --> 00:04:29,669
- WHAT DO YOU NEED MONEY FOR? 
A DIVORCE?

122
00:04:29,669 --> 00:04:32,472
- NO, MOM. TOBIAS AND I 
ARE DOING FINE, THANK YOU.

123
00:04:32,472 --> 00:04:34,707
IT'S MY CREDIT CARD DEBT. 
- FORGET IT.

124
00:04:34,707 --> 00:04:36,576
- FINE. I'LL ASK MICHAEL. 
HE'LL GIVE IT TO ME.

125
00:04:36,576 --> 00:04:38,278
- MAYBE IF YOU GET HIM DRUNK. 
IT'S THE ONLY WAY

126
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:40,112
HE'LL GIVE MONEY...

127
00:04:40,112 --> 00:04:43,082
TO SOMEONE HE CALLS 
A "STAY-IN-BED MOM."

128
00:04:43,082 --> 00:04:46,919
- HE SAID THAT ABOUT ME? 
- I THOUGHT IT WAS HARSH.

129
00:04:46,919 --> 00:04:47,920
BUT, YOU KNOW, HE THINKS

130
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:50,189
YOU'RE COMPLETELY 
IRRESPONSIBLE.

131
00:04:50,189 --> 00:04:52,458
A STAY-IN-BED MOM.

132
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:55,828
PROBABLY BECAUSE YOU DON'T WORK 
AND YOU'RE LAZY.

133
00:04:55,828 --> 00:04:57,730
HIS WORDS.

134
00:04:57,730 --> 00:05:00,265
- I CAN'T BELIEVE HIM. 
- I KNOW!

135
00:05:00,265 --> 00:05:03,235
JUST WHEN YOU WERE 
GETTING ALONG SO WELL.

136
00:05:10,109 --> 00:05:12,144
- THEY'VE GOT TO BE 
KIDDING ME.

137
00:05:16,616 --> 00:05:18,651
narrator: MICHAEL'S BROTHER GOB, 
MEANWHILE,

138
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:20,085
HAD MISSED THE MEETING 
THAT MORNING

139
00:05:20,085 --> 00:05:22,822
AFTER BEING DELAYED BY HIS 
GIRLFRIEND MARTA.

140
00:05:22,822 --> 00:05:25,625
- TE QUIERO!

141
00:05:25,625 --> 00:05:28,328
- ENGLISH, PLEASE. 
- I LOVE YOU.

142
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:30,563
- GREAT. 
NOW I'M LATE.

143
00:05:30,563 --> 00:05:32,998
narrator: AND WHILE GOB TOOK 
HIS GIRLFRIEND FOR GRANTED,

144
00:05:32,998 --> 00:05:35,735
MICHAEL WAS LEARNING SPANISH 
TO GET CLOSER TO HER.

145
00:05:35,735 --> 00:05:38,237
- THAT IS NOT SOMETHING 
I CAN BRING TO MY BOSS.

146
00:05:38,237 --> 00:05:40,305
narrator: UNFORTUNATELY, 
THE ONE TAPE HE COULD FIND

147
00:05:40,305 --> 00:05:42,742
WAS OF LITTLE USE TO HIM.

148
00:05:42,742 --> 00:05:44,710
- ARE YOU GOING 
TO THE COMPLIMENTARY BREAKFAST?

149
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:47,212
- [speaking Spanish] 
THAT'LL GET HER HOT.

150
00:05:47,212 --> 00:05:50,049
- WELL, IF IT ISN'T THE BOY 
WHO LIVES UNDER THE STAIRS.

151
00:05:50,049 --> 00:05:51,083
- HEY, GOB.

152
00:05:51,083 --> 00:05:52,251
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING, 
LEARNING SPANISH?

153
00:05:52,251 --> 00:05:56,922
- NOPE. IT'S, UH--IT'S SOMETHING 
FOR WORK, SO, YES, UH, YEAH.

154
00:06:01,827 --> 00:06:04,864
narrator: MEANWHILE, BUSTER WAS 
TRYING TO GET GEORGE MICHAEL..

155
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:07,500
TO TAKE HIS PLACE AS ADAM.

156
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,869
- I DON'T KNOW, 
UNCLE BUSTER.

157
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:11,671
- WELL, YOU DON'T HAVE 
THE "FRONTSPIECE" YET.

158
00:06:11,671 --> 00:06:12,672
- "FRONTSPIECE"?

159
00:06:12,672 --> 00:06:13,673
- LOOK, I DON'T WANT TO GO 
THROUGH

160
00:06:13,673 --> 00:06:14,840
A WHOLE SONG AND DANCE WITH YOU.

161
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:17,176
YOU'RE GOING TO LOVE IT.

162
00:06:17,176 --> 00:06:19,712
YOU JUST CAN'T DO ANYTHING THAT 
VIOLATES THE ORIGINAL PAINTING,

163
00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:21,246
LIKE GIGGLING OR ITCHING.

164
00:06:21,246 --> 00:06:23,716
THEY DO ALLOW 
SOME NERVOUS CRYING,

165
00:06:23,716 --> 00:06:26,519
BUT YOU CAN TELL 
THEY DON'T LIKE IT.

166
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:28,320
narrator: AND MAEBY 
WAS TEACHING HER PARENTS

167
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,822
A LESSON FOR FORGETTING HER--

168
00:06:29,822 --> 00:06:32,458
- WHO KNOWS 
HOW LONG I'LL BE GONE?

169
00:06:32,458 --> 00:06:33,759
narrator: WHEN SHE SPOTTED 
GEORGE MICHAEL.

170
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:36,629
- NICE PECS. 
GOT A KICKIN' BOD.

171
00:06:36,629 --> 00:06:39,164
narrator: THUS, GEORGE MICHAEL 
FOUND A COMPELLING REASON

172
00:06:39,164 --> 00:06:40,500
TO KEEP THE MUSCLE SUIT ON.

173
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:42,802
[ringing]

174
00:06:42,802 --> 00:06:45,538
- LAW OFFICES 
OF BARRY ZUCKERKORN.

175
00:06:45,538 --> 00:06:47,339
- YEAH, IT'S MICHAEL BLUTH FOR 
BARRY.

176
00:06:47,339 --> 00:06:48,340
- [whispers] 
I'M NOT HERE.

177
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:51,210
- BARRY'S NOT HERE. 
CAN I GIVE HER A MESSAGE?

178
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:53,579
- TELL HER SHE NEEDS TO WHISPER 
A LITTLE SOFTER NEXT TIME,

179
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:56,415
AND I'M NOT PAYING 
FOR THIS PHONE CALL.

180
00:06:56,415 --> 00:06:59,251
- I AM NOT A GIRL, 
YOU BOW-TIED--

181
00:06:59,251 --> 00:07:01,887
- GO ON. CALL ME SOMETHING. 
I'M REDOING MY KITCHEN.

182
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:04,890
- THAT'S IT. I'VE HAD IT 
WITH THIS JERK BARRY.

183
00:07:04,890 --> 00:07:06,459
I'M GOING TO MAKE 
MOM SIT DOWN WITH WAYNE

184
00:07:06,459 --> 00:07:07,593
WHETHER SHE LIKES IT OR NOT.

185
00:07:07,593 --> 00:07:08,594
- YOU'RE THE JERK.

186
00:07:08,594 --> 00:07:10,730
- DID I JUST WAKE YOU UP? 
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU WERE HOME.

187
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:13,599
- NO, MICHAEL, 
I DON'T JUST SLEEP ALL DAY.

188
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:15,568
narrator: ACTUALLY, LINDSAY 
WAS SO UPSET AT MICHAEL...

189
00:07:15,568 --> 00:07:18,738
THAT SHE TRIED MEDITATING 
TO CALM HERSELF,

190
00:07:18,738 --> 00:07:21,674
BUT ENDED UP TAKING 
A TWO-HOUR ANGRY NAP.

191
00:07:21,674 --> 00:07:23,909
- YEAH, THIS SUITCASE 
SHOULD BE BIG ENOUGH.

192
00:07:23,909 --> 00:07:27,179
- WHERE IS ALL THIS COMING FROM? 
I THOUGHT WE WERE GETTING ALONG.

193
00:07:27,179 --> 00:07:28,180
- YEAH, SO DID I.

194
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:30,082
AND NOW I HEAR YOU'RE 
TELLING OUR MOTHER...

195
00:07:30,082 --> 00:07:31,517
THAT I'M COMPLETELY 
IRRESPONSIBLE

196
00:07:31,517 --> 00:07:33,719
AND A STAY-IN-BED MOM.

197
00:07:33,719 --> 00:07:35,688
- THAT DOESN'T EVEN 
SOUND LIKE ME.

198
00:07:35,688 --> 00:07:38,891
THAT SOUNDS LIKE MOM 
OR BRUCE VILANCH.

199
00:07:38,891 --> 00:07:41,293
COULD BE BRUCE VILANCH. 
- THEN WHY WOULD SHE SAY IT?

200
00:07:41,293 --> 00:07:43,896
- BECAUSE WE'RE GETTING ALONG. 
- BECAUSE WE'RE FRIENDS AGAIN.

201
00:07:43,896 --> 00:07:44,897
- YOU GOTTA REMEMBER--

202
00:07:44,897 --> 00:07:46,666
MOM TYPICALLY HAS 
NOTHING IN HER SYSTEM...

203
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:48,734
EXCEPT A BOTTLE OF VODKA 
AND AN ESTROGEN PILL.

204
00:07:48,734 --> 00:07:51,036
- SPEAKING OF WHICH--

205
00:07:51,036 --> 00:07:53,473
narrator: MICHAEL AND LINDSAY 
PROCEEDED TO DRINK...

206
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:55,508
AND AIR THEIR GRIEVANCES 
ABOUT THEIR MOTHER.

207
00:07:55,508 --> 00:07:57,176
- SHE'S ALWAYS TRYING 
TO GET ME TO ADMIT THAT

208
00:07:57,176 --> 00:07:59,311
MY MARRIAGE ISN'T WORKING.

209
00:07:59,311 --> 00:08:00,846
- AND HOW'S IT GOING 
WITH YOU AND TOBIAS?

210
00:08:00,846 --> 00:08:02,147
- IT'S NOT WORKING.

211
00:08:02,147 --> 00:08:05,518
AND THAT'S WHY I WANTED HER HELP 
WITH MY CREDIT CARD DEBT.

212
00:08:05,518 --> 00:08:07,352
I'M TRYING TO TAKE AT LEAST 
SOME OF THE PRESSURE

213
00:08:07,352 --> 00:08:08,387
OFF THIS MARRIAGE.

214
00:08:08,387 --> 00:08:11,824
AND IF ANYTHING, IT'S WORSE NOW 
THAT WE'RE SHARING A BEDROOM.

215
00:08:11,824 --> 00:08:13,859
- YOU GUYS WERE NOT 
SHARING A BEDROOM BEFORE?

216
00:08:13,859 --> 00:08:16,261
- WELL, THE CUTOFFS 
AREN'T EXACTLY A TURN-ON.

217
00:08:16,261 --> 00:08:18,764
- YEAH, WHAT'S THE DEAL WITH THE 
CUTOFFS?

218
00:08:18,764 --> 00:08:21,967
- YOU'VE GOT TO PROMISE 
NOT TO TELL ANYONE THIS.

219
00:08:21,967 --> 00:08:25,771
- OKAY. 
- HE'S A NEVER-NUDE.

220
00:08:25,771 --> 00:08:28,240
- IS THAT EXACTLY 
WHAT IT SOUNDS LIKE?

221
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,676
narrator: TOBIAS SUFFERED A RARE 
PSYCHOLOGICAL AFFLICTION...

222
00:08:30,676 --> 00:08:33,345
OF NEVER BEING ABLE 
TO BE COMPLETELY NAKED.

223
00:08:33,345 --> 00:08:35,815
- EXCUSE ME. DO THESE 
EFFECTIVELY HIDE MY THUNDER?

224
00:08:35,815 --> 00:08:36,816
- OH, I'M SORRY.

225
00:08:36,816 --> 00:08:39,819
NO, I NEED YOU TO BE 
COMPLETELY UNDRESSED.

226
00:08:39,819 --> 00:08:42,955
- I AM COMPLETELY 
UNDRESSED.

227
00:08:42,955 --> 00:08:44,256
- I THOUGHT HE JUST LIKED 
CUTOFFS.

228
00:08:44,256 --> 00:08:45,925
- ME TOO.

229
00:08:45,925 --> 00:08:48,427
WHAT ABOUT YOU? WHAT'S GOING ON 
WITH YOUR LOVE LIFE?

230
00:08:48,427 --> 00:08:50,462
HAVE YOU EVEN MET ANYONE 
SINCE YOUR WIFE?

231
00:08:50,462 --> 00:08:51,463
- THAT IS THE ONE SUBJECT

232
00:08:51,463 --> 00:08:53,465
I AM NOT EAGER TO TALK ABOUT, 
LINDSAY.

233
00:08:53,465 --> 00:08:55,768
I LOVE MARTA.

234
00:08:57,537 --> 00:09:00,505
- MOM'S HOUSEKEEPER? 
- GOB'S GIRLFRIEND.

235
00:09:00,505 --> 00:09:03,108
- OH, MY GOD. 
- YEAH.

236
00:09:03,108 --> 00:09:07,012
- LISTEN. YOU'RE A GREAT GUY, 
AND IF SHE DOESN'T SEE THAT,

237
00:09:07,012 --> 00:09:08,013
THEN SOMEONE ELSE WILL.

238
00:09:08,013 --> 00:09:10,249
- YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE, LINDSAY? 
YOU'RE GREAT.

239
00:09:10,249 --> 00:09:11,684
AND I'M GONNA MOVE SOME 
MONEY AROUND

240
00:09:11,684 --> 00:09:13,152
IF IT'S GONNA 
HELP YOU GET OUT OF DEBT.

241
00:09:13,152 --> 00:09:14,253
YOU KNOW, I'D BE HAPPY TO DO 
THAT.

242
00:09:14,253 --> 00:09:15,921
- NO, MICHAEL. 
- YEAH.

243
00:09:15,921 --> 00:09:16,922
THE HELL WITH MOM.

244
00:09:16,922 --> 00:09:20,660
AND HERE, MOM'S NEVER GONNA 
GET BETWEEN US AGAIN.

245
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:23,428
narrator: THE NEXT DAY, BUSTER, 
HAVING PAWNED OFF PLAYING ADAM,

246
00:09:23,428 --> 00:09:26,431
WENT TO LUCILLE 2 TO ASK HER OUT 
FOR CHRISTMAS EVE.

247
00:09:26,431 --> 00:09:30,670
- THAT IS TERRIFIC 'CAUSE I GOT 
TWO TICKETS TO THE PAGEANT!

248
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:34,539
- [clears throat] MY--MY 
MOTHER'S GOING TO BE THERE.

249
00:09:34,539 --> 00:09:36,508
narrator: AND GEORGE MICHAEL 
WAS TRYING TO PASS...

250
00:09:36,508 --> 00:09:38,210
AS A MORE MUSCULAR BOY 
THAN HE ACTUALLY WAS.

251
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:39,211
- ONE HUNDRED.

252
00:09:39,211 --> 00:09:41,013
- ONE HUNDRED? 
I HAD YOU AT 10.

253
00:09:41,013 --> 00:09:42,114
- I DID SOME EARLIER IN THE DAY.

254
00:09:42,114 --> 00:09:44,684
IT'S A RUNNING TOTAL. 
SO WHAT'S WITH THE SUITCASE?

255
00:09:44,684 --> 00:09:47,552
- IT'S A LITTLE TEST TO GET MY 
PARENTS TO NOTICE ME.

256
00:09:47,552 --> 00:09:49,554
YOU EVER GET THE FEELING 
LIKE NO ONE EVEN SEES YOU?

257
00:09:49,554 --> 00:09:53,926
- I'VE GOT A REALLY GOOD BODY, 
SO...NO.

258
00:09:53,926 --> 00:09:55,327
- HEY, GANG. 
WHAT YOU DOING?

259
00:09:55,327 --> 00:09:57,763
- JUST PACKING UP. 
PACKING IT ON UP.

260
00:09:57,763 --> 00:09:58,731
- UH-HUH.

261
00:09:58,731 --> 00:10:01,100
LISTEN, CAN I TALK TO YOU 
ALONE FOR A MOMENT?

262
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,301
- I'LL LEAVE YOU TWO ALONE HERE.

263
00:10:02,301 --> 00:10:04,604
- OH, NO, GEORGE MICHAEL, 
I MEANT YOU.

264
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:07,206
- MAEBY, CAN WE HAVE THE ROOM?

265
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:15,014
SO, AS YOU KNOW, I WAS HOPING TO 
PLAY ADAM IN THIS THING,

266
00:10:15,014 --> 00:10:19,118
AND I WANT YOU TO KNOW 
THAT I AM NOT THREATENED.

267
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:21,486
- YOU KNOW, I'D BE HAPPY 
TO LET YOU PLAY ADAM.

268
00:10:21,486 --> 00:10:23,689
- GIVE ME THE SUIT. 
GIVE ME THE SUIT.

269
00:10:23,689 --> 00:10:27,126
- I'M ACTUALLY WEARING IT RIGHT 
NOW, AND I CAN'T TELL YOU WHY.

270
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:29,161
- YOU'RE WEARING IT 
RIGHT NOW?

271
00:10:29,161 --> 00:10:30,329
- I HAVE TO WEAR IT ALL THE 
TIME.

272
00:10:30,329 --> 00:10:31,964
YOU'D NEVER UNDERSTAND.

273
00:10:31,964 --> 00:10:35,434
- OH, PLEASE. 
I'LL NEVER UNDER--

274
00:10:35,434 --> 00:10:39,271
I'LL NEVER UNDERSTAND... 
THAT YOU CAN NEVER BE NUDE?

275
00:10:45,577 --> 00:10:49,581
I UNDERSTAND MORE THAN 
YOU'LL NEVER KNOW.

276
00:10:55,387 --> 00:10:57,222
- YIKES.

277
00:10:57,222 --> 00:10:59,058
narrator: MICHAEL 
FINALLY ARRANGED A MEETING

278
00:10:59,058 --> 00:11:00,459
WITH ATTORNEY WAYNE JARVIS.

279
00:11:00,459 --> 00:11:01,460
- LOOKING FOR A MORE

280
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:02,427
PROFESSIONAL APPROACH 
TO OUR REPRESENTATION.

281
00:11:02,427 --> 00:11:03,863
- WELL, I'M A PROFESSIONAL.

282
00:11:03,863 --> 00:11:05,330
I'M SERIOUS, 
AND I'M A PROFESSIONAL.

283
00:11:05,330 --> 00:11:06,966
- THAT'S FANTASTIC.

284
00:11:06,966 --> 00:11:08,500
SO HOW LONG HAVE YOU 
BEEN PRACTICING--

285
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:09,468
- I ALSO DON'T LIKE SMALL TALK.

286
00:11:09,468 --> 00:11:10,569
I FIND THAT UNPROFESSIONAL.

287
00:11:10,569 --> 00:11:12,938
WHY SHOULD I BE BILLING YOU 
FOR SMALL TALK...

288
00:11:12,938 --> 00:11:14,940
WHEN I'M ENJOYING IT 
AS MUCH AS YOU ARE?

289
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:18,110
- THEN THIS MUST BE A FREEBIE 
'CAUSE I'M HAVING A BALL.

290
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:20,645
- [chuckles] WHEN YOU'RE READY 
TO GET SERIOUS, GIVE ME A CALL.

291
00:11:20,645 --> 00:11:21,947
- NO, NO! NO, I'M SORRY. 
I'M SORRY.

292
00:11:21,947 --> 00:11:25,217
I'M SERIOUS. 
I'M READY.

293
00:11:25,217 --> 00:11:26,518
- GOOD. 
IF YOU RETAIN MY SERVICES,

294
00:11:26,518 --> 00:11:29,188
I WILL GET YOUR FATHER 
OUT OF JAIL,

295
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:31,156
AND WE WILL BE COUNTERSUING 
BEFORE THE END OF THE YEAR.

296
00:11:31,156 --> 00:11:33,959
WE'RE GONNA GET THIS COMPANY'S 
NAME BACK TO WHERE IT STARTED.

297
00:11:33,959 --> 00:11:34,960
- OR HOPEFULLY HIGHER.

298
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,661
- I DIDN'T SAY THAT. 
DON'T HOLD ME TO THAT.

299
00:11:36,661 --> 00:11:40,565
- I WON'T, AND I APPRECIATE THAT 
TO A WONDERFUL DEGREE.

300
00:11:40,565 --> 00:11:43,035
MY MOTHER 
IS ON HER WAY UP HERE,

301
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:46,939
AND SHE'S RESISTANT TO THE IDEA 
OF HIRING A NEW ATTORNEY.

302
00:11:46,939 --> 00:11:49,541
IF SHE EVEN SEES YOU, SHE 
PROBABLY WON'T COME IN THE ROOM.

303
00:11:49,541 --> 00:11:52,111
- I SHALL DUCK BEHIND THE COUCH.

304
00:11:52,111 --> 00:11:54,579
- WHAT A PRO. 
[bell dings]

305
00:11:55,848 --> 00:11:57,549
- MICHAEL. 
- HI.

306
00:11:57,549 --> 00:12:00,853
- I NEED TO GET THE MONEY TO GET 
YOUR FATHER OUT FOR THE PAGEANT.

307
00:12:00,853 --> 00:12:02,788
- ACTUALLY, THAT'S NOT WHY 
I CALLED YOU HERE TODAY,

308
00:12:02,788 --> 00:12:04,456
AND I'M NOT DOING THAT.

309
00:12:04,456 --> 00:12:07,126
I GAVE THAT MONEY TO LINDSAY 
TO PAY OFF HER CREDIT CARD DEBT.

310
00:12:07,126 --> 00:12:10,763
- WHAT'D SHE DO, GET YOU DRUNK? 
- NO, WE JUST, UH, WELL--

311
00:12:10,763 --> 00:12:13,532
WE DID DRINK A LITTLE BIT. 
HOW'D YOU KNOW THAT?

312
00:12:13,532 --> 00:12:15,500
- BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT 
SHE SAID SHE'D DO.

313
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:17,036
- I SAID YOU WOULDN'T GIVE HER 
THE MONEY,

314
00:12:17,036 --> 00:12:18,737
AND SHE SAID, 
"HE WILL IF I GET HIM DRUNK."

315
00:12:18,737 --> 00:12:21,173
PROBABLY BECAUSE SHE THINKS 
YOU'RE A CHEAP BASTARD.

316
00:12:21,173 --> 00:12:23,242
OH. 
HER WORDS.

317
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:25,344
- SHE SET ME UP?

318
00:12:25,344 --> 00:12:27,012
ALL THAT STUFF 
ABOUT HER MARITAL TROUBLES

319
00:12:27,012 --> 00:12:30,182
AND TOBIAS BEING A NEVER-NUDE?

320
00:12:30,182 --> 00:12:34,186
- A NEVER-NUDE? I THOUGHT 
HE JUST LIKED CUTOFFS.

321
00:12:34,186 --> 00:12:36,355
- HOW DO YOU TREAT SOMEBODY 
IN YOUR OWN FAMILY LIKE THAT,

322
00:12:36,355 --> 00:12:37,957
LYING AND DECEIVING 
AND SAYING ANYTHING

323
00:12:37,957 --> 00:12:40,860
JUST TO GET YOUR OWN WAY?

324
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:42,261
- SO WHAT DID YOU WANT 
TO SEE ME ABOUT?

325
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:43,695
- HMM?

326
00:12:43,695 --> 00:12:47,466
OH, UM, THERE'S A BIG BOWL 
OF CANDY IN MY OFFICE.

327
00:12:47,466 --> 00:12:50,269
WHY DON'T YOU GO EAT IT? 
- WAYNE JARVIS, ATTORNEY AT LAW.

328
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:52,171
I HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY 
TO TELL YOU THAT THERE IS

329
00:12:52,171 --> 00:12:54,706
NO CANDY IN THIS OFFICE.

330
00:12:54,706 --> 00:12:56,075
- LINDSAY.

331
00:13:01,146 --> 00:13:05,250
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? 
- I HAD TO GET AWAY FROM MARTA.

332
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:07,319
IF I HAVE TO SMELL ANOTHER MEAL 
OF FISH, RICE AND MANGO,

333
00:13:07,319 --> 00:13:09,421
I'M GONNA KILL SOMEBODY.

334
00:13:09,421 --> 00:13:11,556
NOW MICHAEL'S LEARNING SPANISH. 
WHAT'S UP WITH THAT?

335
00:13:11,556 --> 00:13:13,092
- OH, WHO KNOWS?

336
00:13:13,092 --> 00:13:15,060
HE WON'T GET YOUR FATHER 
OUT OF JAIL FOR A NIGHT.

337
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:16,361
HE'S BRINGING IN 
A NEW ATTORNEY.

338
00:13:16,361 --> 00:13:17,729
- NEW ATTORNEY?

339
00:13:17,729 --> 00:13:20,799
AND HE'S 
LEARNING SPANISH?

340
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:22,868
HE'S HIDING SOMETHING.

341
00:13:22,868 --> 00:13:25,637
AND I INTEND TO FIND OUT 
WHAT IT IS.

342
00:13:25,637 --> 00:13:29,274
- DO YOURSELF A FAVOR. 
GET HIM DRUNK.

343
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:37,582
- [scoffs] 
BARRY.

344
00:13:38,817 --> 00:13:41,420
I SEE YOU'RE GETTING CLOSER 
TO OUR ATTORNEY.

345
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:42,487
WELL, I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW

346
00:13:42,487 --> 00:13:45,224
THAT I WON'T BE NEEDING 
YOUR HELP AFTER ALL.

347
00:13:45,224 --> 00:13:47,126
MY BROTHER MICHAEL CAME THROUGH 
AS HE ALWAYS DOES

348
00:13:47,126 --> 00:13:49,995
AND AS YOU NEVER DO.

349
00:13:49,995 --> 00:13:51,730
- WHATEVER IT TAKES TO GET 
YOUR RELATIONSHIP

350
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:54,033
WITH THAT 
NEVER-NUDE BACK ON TRACK.

351
00:13:56,101 --> 00:13:58,603
- MICHAEL TOLD YOU THAT? 
- HE COULDN'T WAIT TO.

352
00:13:58,603 --> 00:14:01,073
narrator: AND LATER, WHILE 
MICHAEL WAS MEETING WITH WAYNE--

353
00:14:01,073 --> 00:14:02,374
- MY THING WITH TOBIAS WAS 
A SECRET

354
00:14:02,374 --> 00:14:04,476
LIKE YOU STEALING YOUR BROTHER'S 
GIRLFRIEND, YOU LITTLE WEASEL!

355
00:14:04,476 --> 00:14:06,178
I OPEN UP TO YOU, 
AND YOU RUN AND TELL MOMMY!

356
00:14:06,178 --> 00:14:07,279
- EXCUSE ME.

357
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:09,248
OUTSIDE, PLEASE. 
THANK YOU. PARDON US.

358
00:14:09,248 --> 00:14:11,316
LIKE IT ALL WASN'T JUST LIES 
TO GET ME TO PAY THAT DEBT.

359
00:14:11,316 --> 00:14:13,052
ISN'T THAT WHY YOU GOT ME DRUNK 
IN THE FIRST PLACE?

360
00:14:13,052 --> 00:14:14,053
- I GOT YOU DRUNK.

361
00:14:14,053 --> 00:14:15,320
- MOM TOLD ME ABOUT 
YOUR LITTLE PLAN.

362
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,889
- WHAT PLAN? 
I HAD A GREAT TIME LAST NIGHT!

363
00:14:16,889 --> 00:14:18,657
- SO DID I!

364
00:14:18,657 --> 00:14:20,125
- THEN WHY ARE WE 
YELLING AT EACH OTHER?

365
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:21,126
- MOM.

366
00:14:21,126 --> 00:14:24,596
- UNBELIEVABLE. 
- SHE DID IT AGAIN.

367
00:14:24,596 --> 00:14:26,265
ALL RIGHT. WE'VE GOT 
TO TEACH HER A LESSON.

368
00:14:26,265 --> 00:14:28,901
- HMM.

369
00:14:28,901 --> 00:14:29,902
- EXCUSE ME, WAYNE,

370
00:14:29,902 --> 00:14:32,872
MY SISTER AND I WERE OUTSIDE 
HAVING A BUSINESS DISCUSSION,

371
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:35,540
AND WE WERE WONDERING IF THERE'S 
SOME SORT OF LEGAL WAY...

372
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:38,343
THAT WE CAN HUMILIATE 
OUR MOTHER.

373
00:14:38,343 --> 00:14:40,845
SOMETHING SHAMING, 
SOMETHING PUBLIC.

374
00:14:40,845 --> 00:14:42,614
I'VE USED ONE ADJECTIVE 
TO DESCRIBE MYSELF.

375
00:14:42,614 --> 00:14:44,183
WHAT IS IT?

376
00:14:44,183 --> 00:14:46,185
- PROFESSIONAL.

377
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:54,927
- SO HOW ARE WE GOING 
TO SCREW MOM?

378
00:14:54,927 --> 00:14:56,128
- MAYBE WE CAN GET 
BARRY TO HELP.

379
00:14:56,128 --> 00:14:57,129
- FORGET IT.

380
00:14:57,129 --> 00:14:58,230
I WAS RIGHT ABOUT THEM 
ALL ALONG.

381
00:14:58,230 --> 00:14:59,864
YOU KNOW BARRY'S 
TAKING MOM TO THE PAGEANT?

382
00:14:59,864 --> 00:15:01,733
- ON A DATE? 
- YEAH.

383
00:15:01,733 --> 00:15:05,204
- UGH! YOU KNOW, IF DAD COULD 
SEE HER ON A DATE WITH BARRY,

384
00:15:05,204 --> 00:15:07,172
HE'D GO CRAZY.

385
00:15:07,172 --> 00:15:09,942
- WHICH WOULD ALLOW US 
TO HIRE WAYNE.

386
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:13,278
- HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT 
STAYING IN DEBT

387
00:15:13,278 --> 00:15:14,879
JUST A LITTLE BIT LONGER?

388
00:15:14,879 --> 00:15:16,648
narrator: SO THEY 
DECIDED TO SPEND THE MONEY

389
00:15:16,648 --> 00:15:18,417
MICHAEL HAD PROMISED LINDSAY..

390
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:19,985
TO GET THEIR FATHER OUT 
FOR THE PAGEANT,

391
00:15:19,985 --> 00:15:22,587
WHERE HE'D CATCH HIS WIFE ON A 
DATE WITH BARRY.

392
00:15:22,587 --> 00:15:26,258
MAEBY, TOO, CONTINUED TO TRY 
TO TEACH HER PARENTS A LESSON.

393
00:15:26,258 --> 00:15:28,928
- OKAY, SO I PRINTED THE FAKE 
AIRLINE TICKET FROM MY COMPUTER.

394
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:29,929
IF MY PARENTS MISS THIS,

395
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:32,531
I REALLY MIGHT GO 
TO SOUTH AMERICA.

396
00:15:32,531 --> 00:15:35,167
- THAT SAYS "PORTUGAL." 
- THAT'S RIGHT.

397
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:37,236
narrator: MAEBY'S PARENTS DIDN'T 
FIND THE TICKET,

398
00:15:37,236 --> 00:15:41,440
BUT GOB DID-- 
- "PORTUGAL."

399
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,875
narrator: WHICH CONFIRMED 
HIS SUSPICIONS.

400
00:15:43,875 --> 00:15:46,678
- GONNA LIVE IT UP DOWN OLD 
SOUTH AMERICA WAY, HUH, MIKEY?

401
00:15:46,678 --> 00:15:50,115
narrator: AND BUSTER FINALLY 
GAVE IN TO LUCILLE 2'S WISHES.

402
00:15:50,115 --> 00:15:53,552
- YOU READY TO SHOW ME OFF 
BEFORE GOD AND THE WHOLE WORLD?

403
00:15:53,552 --> 00:15:55,887
- IT'S NOT MY DAD'S REACTION 
I'M WORRIED ABOUT.

404
00:15:55,887 --> 00:15:57,656
narrator: AND GEORGE MICHAEL 
FINALLY SAW THE PAINTING

405
00:15:57,656 --> 00:16:00,125
HE WAS GOING TO BE RE-CREATING.

406
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:03,862
- [singing] 
AIN'T NO BIG THING, WOW

407
00:16:03,862 --> 00:16:05,297
narrator: AND THEN WHAT 
"FRONTSPIECE" MEANT.

408
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:07,466
- [singing] LOSING CONTROL

409
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:10,269
AIN'T NO BIG THING

410
00:16:11,036 --> 00:16:13,405
WOW

411
00:16:13,405 --> 00:16:16,175
narrator: GEORGE SR. GOT HIS 24 
HOURS OF FREEDOM

412
00:16:16,175 --> 00:16:18,110
AS THE PAGEANT FINALLY BEGAN.

413
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:19,711
- YOU KNOW, I SAW YOU 
DO THIS WHEN I WAS A KID.

414
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:21,946
I WAS SO IMPRESSED.

415
00:16:21,946 --> 00:16:25,985
YOU KNOW, YOU WERE 
SO STILL AND GODLIKE.

416
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:28,387
IT WAS AT THAT MOMENT 
THAT I KNEW I WOULD BE A DANCER.

417
00:16:29,921 --> 00:16:31,923
- GLAD I COULD 
MAKE A DIFFERENCE.

418
00:16:31,923 --> 00:16:33,492
narrator: MICHAEL AND LINDSAY 
SEARCHED THE CROWD

419
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:34,726
FOR THEIR MOTHER AND BARRY,

420
00:16:34,726 --> 00:16:37,229
SO THEY COULD REVEL IN THE 
PUBLIC SHAMING

421
00:16:37,229 --> 00:16:38,297
THEY HAD ENGINEERED.

422
00:16:38,297 --> 00:16:39,231
- MOM, WHAT THE HELL 
ARE YOU DOING?

423
00:16:39,231 --> 00:16:42,301
narrator: BUT INSTEAD THEY FOUND 
HER WITH WAYNE.

424
00:16:42,301 --> 00:16:44,403
- I DON'T HAVE TO ANSWER THAT.

425
00:16:44,403 --> 00:16:46,671
- I DON'T KNOW WHICH ONE OF YOU 
I'M MORE DISAPPOINTED IN.

426
00:16:46,671 --> 00:16:48,807
NO, IT'S WAYNE. 
WAYNE--

427
00:16:48,807 --> 00:16:51,576
- I HAVE NEEDS. I AM A MAN! 
- HEY, WATCH--

428
00:16:51,576 --> 00:16:52,577
- WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE?

429
00:16:52,577 --> 00:16:54,413
YOUR FATHER DOESN'T 
CARE ABOUT ME.

430
00:16:54,413 --> 00:16:57,016
BARRY TELLS ME HE'S NOT EVEN 
TRYING TO GET OUT OF PRISON.

431
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:59,918
- MOM, HE'S HERE. DAD'S HERE. 
- HE'S HERE?

432
00:16:59,918 --> 00:17:02,354
- YEAH, HE'S HERE. 
WHY DID YOU DO THIS?

433
00:17:02,354 --> 00:17:03,788
- WE WERE TRYING 
TO TEACH YOU A LESSON.

434
00:17:03,788 --> 00:17:04,756
- YOU IDIOTS!

435
00:17:04,756 --> 00:17:07,992
IF HE SEES ME WITH WAYNE-- 
- WE'LL BE STUCK WITH BARRY.

436
00:17:07,992 --> 00:17:11,030
- I SHALL DUCK BEHIND 
THAT LITTLE GARBAGE CAR.

437
00:17:12,464 --> 00:17:14,499
- GUY'S A PRO.

438
00:17:14,499 --> 00:17:16,468
- AND NOW, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,

439
00:17:16,468 --> 00:17:19,338
MICHELANGELO'S 
THE CREATION OF ADAM.

440
00:17:19,338 --> 00:17:22,641
narrator: AND GEORGE MICHAEL 
MADE HIS DEBUT--

441
00:17:22,641 --> 00:17:25,110
- HEY, THAT'S MY-- 
YIKES.

442
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:26,678
BREAKING THE PAGEANT'S 
CARDINAL RULE.

443
00:17:26,678 --> 00:17:28,913
[crowd booing] 
- HOW DARE HE!

444
00:17:28,913 --> 00:17:31,983
- OH, STOP BOOING! 
THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH IT.

445
00:17:31,983 --> 00:17:36,055
THERE ARE DOZENS OF US. 
DOZENS!

446
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:38,257
narrator: BUSTER ARRIVED 
WITH LUCILLE AUSTERO...

447
00:17:38,257 --> 00:17:39,958
AND NATURALLY ASSUMED 
THE YELLS OF DISGUST

448
00:17:39,958 --> 00:17:42,227
WERE DIRECTED TOWARD HIM.

449
00:17:42,227 --> 00:17:44,496
- WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU? 
- WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?

450
00:17:44,496 --> 00:17:46,731
- BUSTER?

451
00:17:46,731 --> 00:17:48,900
- OH, GOD! I'M SORRY.

452
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:52,337
I'M SORRY, LUCILLE. 
YEAH. LUCILLE.

453
00:17:52,337 --> 00:17:54,439
MA, I'M SORRY!

454
00:17:54,439 --> 00:17:55,440
- MAN!

455
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:59,678
THAT OLD LADY HAS REALLY DONE A 
NUMBER ON YOU, HASN'T SHE?

456
00:17:59,678 --> 00:18:00,679
narrator: BUT GEORGE MICHAEL

457
00:18:00,679 --> 00:18:02,914
WASN'T THE ONLY PROBLEM WITH THE 
PAINTING.

458
00:18:02,914 --> 00:18:05,617
- WHERE IS GOD? 
- THERE IS NO GOD!

459
00:18:08,853 --> 00:18:10,855
- THERE GOES 
MY CREDIT CARD PAYMENT.

460
00:18:10,855 --> 00:18:13,225
- DAD! 
DAD!

461
00:18:13,225 --> 00:18:15,260
HEY! DAD!

462
00:18:16,895 --> 00:18:19,364
- EXCUSE ME. 
- DAD!

463
00:18:19,364 --> 00:18:23,102
HEY, DAD, GET BACK HERE! 
- NO! I'M NOT GOING BACK!

464
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:25,104
- DAD, COME HERE!

465
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:29,174
DAD! 
- MICHAEL, I'M ONTO YOU.

466
00:18:29,174 --> 00:18:31,976
THE SPANISH LESSONS, 
THE LAWYER.

467
00:18:31,976 --> 00:18:33,878
IF YOU'RE HEADING FOR PORTUGAL, 
IT'S DUE SOUTH!

468
00:18:33,878 --> 00:18:35,814
- WHAT? 
NO, IT ISN'T.

469
00:18:35,814 --> 00:18:38,617
DAD, YOU'RE NOT GONNA 
OUTRUN ME IN THAT DRESS.

470
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:41,320
- LET GO! FOR GOD'S SAKES, 
I'M NOT EVEN WEARING A JOCK.

471
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:42,621
- DAD, ARE YOU GOING TOO?

472
00:18:46,158 --> 00:18:49,027
- NO ONE IS GOING TO PORTUGAL, 
YOU IDIOT!

473
00:18:49,027 --> 00:18:50,695
LINDSAY AND I BROKE DAD 
OUT OF JAIL FOR A DAY

474
00:18:50,695 --> 00:18:52,431
TO CATCH MOM ON A DATE.

475
00:18:52,431 --> 00:18:55,200
- YOUR MOTHER 
IS ON A DATE? OH.

476
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,601
- DAD!

477
00:18:56,601 --> 00:19:00,038
- OH, OH. 
[buzzing]

478
00:19:00,038 --> 00:19:01,039
- DAD?

479
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:02,774
- narrator: AND SO, 
MANY IN THE BLUTH FAMILY...

480
00:19:02,774 --> 00:19:05,810
GATHERED TOGETHER FOR CHRISTMAS 
EVE...AT PRISON.

481
00:19:05,810 --> 00:19:07,146
- HEY, WHERE'D 
YOUR MUSCLE SUIT GO?

482
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:08,547
- WAIT. 
YOU KNEW?

483
00:19:08,547 --> 00:19:10,081
- YEAH.

484
00:19:10,081 --> 00:19:12,016
- I TOOK IT OFF.

485
00:19:14,986 --> 00:19:16,921
- YOU DID?

486
00:19:19,658 --> 00:19:23,127
YOU HAVE MADE SOME 
TREMENDOUS STRIDES TODAY.

487
00:19:24,729 --> 00:19:26,931
- EVER GET THE FEELING 
LIKE YOU DON'T EVEN MATTER?

488
00:19:26,931 --> 00:19:29,301
- ONLY WHEN I'M AROUND 
MY CHILDREN.

489
00:19:29,301 --> 00:19:30,302
- YOU REACH A CERTAIN AGE,

490
00:19:30,302 --> 00:19:33,305
AND YOU HAVE TO PRACTICALLY 
SCREAM TO GET NOTICED.

491
00:19:33,305 --> 00:19:37,309
- THEY TURN YOU INTO A MONSTER, 
AND THEN THEY CALL YOU ONE.

492
00:19:37,309 --> 00:19:39,778
- I DON'T THINK 
YOU'RE A MONSTER.

493
00:19:39,778 --> 00:19:41,813
- AND I THINK 
YOU'RE A LOVELY GIRL.

494
00:19:41,813 --> 00:19:44,183
YOU KNOW WHAT?

495
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:46,651
I THINK YOU AND I OUGHT TO 
SPEND MORE TIME TOGETHER.

496
00:19:46,651 --> 00:19:48,820
- YEAH.

497
00:19:50,088 --> 00:19:53,692
THAT'LL DRIVE THEM CRAZY. 
- EXACTLY.

498
00:19:53,692 --> 00:19:55,727
narrator: AND MICHAEL WAS FORCED 
TO, ONCE AGAIN,

499
00:19:55,727 --> 00:19:58,330
CALL IN THE COUNSEL 
OF BARRY ZUCKERKORN.

500
00:19:58,330 --> 00:19:59,331
- THANK YOU.

501
00:19:59,331 --> 00:20:00,565
THANK YOU FOR COMING DOWN 
ON CHRISTMAS EVE.

502
00:20:00,565 --> 00:20:04,035
- OH, IT'S LIKE ANY OTHER DAY, 
EXCEPT THAT I BILL DOUBLE.

503
00:20:04,035 --> 00:20:06,238
SO, THEY'RE NOT 
FILING CHARGES.

504
00:20:06,238 --> 00:20:09,007
I GOT THEM TO CALL 
YOUR FLEE FROM JUSTICE

505
00:20:09,007 --> 00:20:10,909
"RELIGIOUS EXPRESSION."

506
00:20:10,909 --> 00:20:13,778
- THIS IS A LAWYER. 
- YEAH, HE'S-- HE'S VERY GOOD.

507
00:20:13,778 --> 00:20:15,347
- AND YOU'RE GONNA HAVE 
TO FORFEIT THAT BOND.

508
00:20:15,347 --> 00:20:17,015
I WAS WAY OFF ABOUT THAT.

509
00:20:17,015 --> 00:20:19,218
- THANKS AGAIN, MIKEY.

510
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:24,389
- CAN I ASK YOU A QUESTION? 
- SURE.

511
00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:27,526
- ARE ALL THE GUYS IN HERE, 
YOU KNOW--

512
00:20:27,526 --> 00:20:30,462
- OH, NO, NO, NO. 
NOT ALL OF THEM.

513
00:20:30,462 --> 00:20:33,865
- YEAH. IT'S NEVER 
THE ONES YOU HOPE.

514
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:38,703
- HOPE? 
- THINK.

515
00:20:38,703 --> 00:20:39,704
- HOW'D IT GO?

516
00:20:39,704 --> 00:20:42,441
- WELL, THE BAD NEWS IS 
YOU'RE IN DEBT AGAIN,

517
00:20:42,441 --> 00:20:45,209
AND WE NEVER BUSTED MOM, 
AND WE'RE STUCK WITH BARRY.

518
00:20:45,209 --> 00:20:47,078
THE GOOD NEWS IS 
WE'VE BEEN ASKED

519
00:20:47,078 --> 00:20:50,549
NEVER TO PARTICIPATE IN THE 
PAGEANT AGAIN.

520
00:20:50,549 --> 00:20:52,517
- WELL, AT LEAST 
WE'RE STILL PALS, HUH?

521
00:20:52,517 --> 00:20:54,919
- YEAH.

522
00:20:54,919 --> 00:20:58,957
THAT'S NOT REALLY 
DOING IT FOR ME THIS TIME.

523
00:20:58,957 --> 00:21:00,459
- YEAH.
