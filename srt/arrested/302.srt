1
00:00:01,542 --> 00:00:03,128
narrator: PREVIOUSLY ON 
ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT.

2
00:00:03,128 --> 00:00:06,922
MICHAEL AND HIS SON WERE CAMPING 
OUT AT THE FAMILY CABIN...

3
00:00:06,922 --> 00:00:08,174
BEFORE IT WAS TO BE RELOCATED.

4
00:00:08,174 --> 00:00:10,926
- I'M JUST IN THE MIDDLE OF A 
STUPID GIRL PROBLEM THAT'S ALL.

5
00:00:10,926 --> 00:00:14,180
- I DON'T EVEN HAVE A GIRL, 
MUCH LESS A STUPID ONE.

6
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:16,557
- NO, THE PROBLEM IS STUPID. 
THE GIRL ISN'T STUPID.

7
00:00:16,557 --> 00:00:19,019
narrator: BUT IF THEY EVER HAD A 
CHILD, IT WOULD BE--

8
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:20,853
BECAUSE THE GIRL 
WAS HIS COUSIN MAEBY.

9
00:00:20,853 --> 00:00:22,522
- TOMORROW MORNING, 
BEFORE WE TELL THE COPS

10
00:00:22,522 --> 00:00:24,023
THAT THAT'S NOT 
POP-POP IN PRISON,

11
00:00:24,023 --> 00:00:26,442
WE'RE GONNA GO DOWN TO THE LAKE, 
WE'RE GONNA DISCUSS

12
00:00:26,442 --> 00:00:28,528
YOUR GIRL PROBLEM MAN-TO-MAN, 
AND IT'S GONNA BE FUN.

13
00:00:28,528 --> 00:00:30,530
ESPECIALLY THE PART 
ABOUT THE COPS.

14
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:32,990
narrator: 
BUT POP-POP HAD OTHER PLANS,

15
00:00:34,742 --> 00:00:38,746
AND MICHAEL AWOKE TO FIND 
HIS CAMPING TRIP GOING SOUTH.

16
00:00:38,746 --> 00:00:41,291
- WELL, YOU BETTER GET UP NOW 
IF YOU WANT TO SEE THE LAKE.

17
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:43,793
narrator: AND THAT WAS WHEN

18
00:00:43,793 --> 00:00:45,545
GEORGE SR. MADE A DESPERATE 
PLEA.

19
00:00:45,545 --> 00:00:49,340
- PROMISE ME YOU WON'T 
SEND ME BACK TO PRISON--

20
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:52,260
SO I CAN BE WITH 
MY DEAR LOVE LUCILLE...

21
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:54,262
IN THE TWILIGHT 
OF HER FACE.

22
00:00:54,262 --> 00:00:57,182
narrator: MICHAEL DIDN'T SEND 
HIS FATHER BACK TO PRISON,

23
00:00:57,182 --> 00:01:00,643
BUT INSTEAD ARRANGED FOR HIM TO 
BE PLACED UNDER HOUSE ARREST.

24
00:01:00,643 --> 00:01:02,812
- GEORGE, WE'RE NEVER 
GOING TO BE

25
00:01:02,812 --> 00:01:04,855
OUT OF EACH OTHER'S SIGHT.

26
00:01:04,855 --> 00:01:07,317
narrator: WHICH MADE THIS WOMAN 
HIS WARDEN.

27
00:01:07,317 --> 00:01:10,653
- OH, DEAR GOD. 
SEND ME BACK TO PRISON.

28
00:01:10,653 --> 00:01:11,862
YOU GOTTA SEND ME 
BACK TO PRISON.

29
00:01:11,862 --> 00:01:13,114
- MORE TOUCHING.

30
00:01:17,493 --> 00:01:19,995
narrator: MICHAEL WENT TO HIS 
PARENTS' PENTHOUSE TO DISCUSS...

31
00:01:19,995 --> 00:01:22,498
HIS FATHER'S EVER-WORSENING 
LEGAL SITUATION.

32
00:01:22,498 --> 00:01:24,500
- WHERE IS EVERYBODY? 
- HOW SHOULD I KNOW, MICHAEL?

33
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:25,751
AS SOON AS FATHER CAME BACK,

34
00:01:25,751 --> 00:01:27,503
I'VE BEEN LIKE 
THE INVISIBLE MAN.

35
00:01:27,503 --> 00:01:30,506
"HELLO! CAN ANYONE SEE ME?"

36
00:01:30,506 --> 00:01:31,757
- WHERE'S YOUR HAND, ANYWAY?

37
00:01:31,757 --> 00:01:33,509
- WHY EVEN BOTHER 
GETTING DRESSED UP?

38
00:01:33,509 --> 00:01:36,512
I HAVE NO ONE. 
- BUSTER, COME ON NOW.

39
00:01:36,512 --> 00:01:38,556
IF YOU'RE REALLY LONELY, MAYBE 
IT'S TIME YOU WENT OUT THERE...

40
00:01:38,556 --> 00:01:41,517
AND YOU GOT YOURSELF A GIRL-- 
A PET.

41
00:01:41,517 --> 00:01:43,978
- HOW ABOUT A TURTLE? 
- GREAT.

42
00:01:43,978 --> 00:01:46,147
- I'VE ALWAYS LOVED THOSE 
LEATHERY LITTLE SNAPPY FACES.

43
00:01:46,147 --> 00:01:47,190
[giggles]

44
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:48,983
- YOU CERTAINLY HAVE A TYPE.

45
00:01:48,983 --> 00:01:51,569
- MOTHER, HAVE YOU SEEN 
MY RUBBER HAND?

46
00:01:51,569 --> 00:01:52,820
- OH, IT'S IN THE DISHWASHER.

47
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:54,530
YOUR FATHER AND I WERE USING IT 
FOR SOMETHING.

48
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:56,532
- OH, FOR GOD'S SAKE.

49
00:01:56,532 --> 00:01:57,950
CAN'T YOU KEEP MY HAND 
TO YOURSELF?

50
00:01:57,950 --> 00:02:01,121
- UH, "USED IT FOR SOMETHING"?

51
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:03,289
- HE'S JUST JEALOUS THAT I HAVE 
A MAN BACK IN MY LIFE.

52
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:07,835
AND GUESS WHAT ELSE 
IS BACK.

53
00:02:07,835 --> 00:02:11,464
- MY BREAKFAST? 
- MY FRISKINESS.

54
00:02:11,464 --> 00:02:14,259
[whispering] 
MAMA HORNY, MICHAEL.

55
00:02:14,259 --> 00:02:15,676
- NO, IT'S MY BREAKFAST.

56
00:02:15,676 --> 00:02:19,139
I'M AMAZED DAD HASN'T STRANGLED 
HIMSELF WITH HIS BELT YET.

57
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:22,099
- OH, WE'RE INTO ALL KINDS 
OF FREAKY STUFF.

58
00:02:22,099 --> 00:02:23,768
- WHY DO I EAT BREAKFAST 
BEFORE I COME HERE?

59
00:02:23,768 --> 00:02:25,353
[clattering]

60
00:02:25,353 --> 00:02:27,563
- WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?

61
00:02:27,563 --> 00:02:30,150
- WELL, NOW THAT DAD'S BACK, 
I'M GOING TO PERFORM...

62
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,401
ONE GRAND ILLUSION FOR HIM

63
00:02:31,401 --> 00:02:33,819
BEFORE HE STRANGLES HIMSELF 
WITH HIS BELT.

64
00:02:33,819 --> 00:02:35,280
- NO, NO. TURNS OUT 
THEY'RE INTO THAT.

65
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,406
- OH.

66
00:02:36,406 --> 00:02:37,657
WELL, CHECK IT.

67
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:39,367
THE ILLUSION IS CALLED 
"FREE BIRD."

68
00:02:39,367 --> 00:02:40,618
A MAGICAL BIRD--

69
00:02:40,618 --> 00:02:43,413
ME IN A BEAK-- 
STANDS ON A PLATFORM.

70
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:45,790
THERE'S A PUFF OF SMOKE, 
THEN I'M GONE.

71
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:49,084
THEN SECONDS LATER, HIGH ABOVE 
IN A ONCE-EMPTY CAGE--

72
00:02:49,084 --> 00:02:50,336
WHO SHOULD APPEAR?

73
00:02:50,336 --> 00:02:51,796
- A GUY THAT KIND OF LOOKS 
LIKE YOU?

74
00:02:51,796 --> 00:02:54,424
- NO. THAT'S NOT 
HOW I DO THE TRICK.

75
00:02:54,424 --> 00:02:57,843
EVEN IF IT WAS, HOW'D THE 
LOOK-ALIKE GET UP THERE?

76
00:02:57,843 --> 00:02:59,429
- HE WAS HIDING BEHIND 
THIS MIRROR HERE?

77
00:02:59,429 --> 00:03:00,513
- NO!

78
00:03:00,513 --> 00:03:02,432
FOR YOUR INFORMATION, 
DAD ASKED ME TO DO THIS...

79
00:03:02,432 --> 00:03:04,434
ON THE DAY HE PLEADS 
NOT GUILTY...

80
00:03:04,434 --> 00:03:06,686
AS A SPECTACULAR PROTEST.

81
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:09,146
A "PROTEST-ACULAR."

82
00:03:09,146 --> 00:03:11,441
MAYBE EVEN GET IT 
ON THE LOCAL NEWS.

83
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:12,692
- EXCUSE ME.

84
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:14,402
I WAS JUST LOOKING 
FOR A MARKER--

85
00:03:14,402 --> 00:03:17,613
A MAGIC MARKER.

86
00:03:17,613 --> 00:03:18,864
- I WANT IT OUT OF MY LIVING 
ROOM.

87
00:03:18,864 --> 00:03:20,575
PUT IT IN BUSTER'S ROOM.

88
00:03:20,575 --> 00:03:23,369
THAT'S WHERE SHE KEEPS THINGS 
SHE HAS NO NEED FOR.

89
00:03:23,369 --> 00:03:25,496
[sniffs] 
OH, GOD.

90
00:03:25,496 --> 00:03:28,165
I'M GONNA RUN THIS THROUGH AGAIN 
ON "POTS AND PANS."

91
00:03:28,165 --> 00:03:30,209
- YOU KNOW, GOB, INSTEAD OF 
TRYING TO IMPRESS A FATHER

92
00:03:30,209 --> 00:03:31,919
THAT COULDN'T CARE LESS 
ABOUT YOU,

93
00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:33,879
WHY DON'T YOU TRY SPENDING 
SOME TIME WITH YOUR SON...

94
00:03:33,879 --> 00:03:36,424
WHO'S DYING 
TO RECONNECT WITH YOU?

95
00:03:36,424 --> 00:03:38,676
narrator: GOB HAD DISCOVERED HE 
WAS THE FATHER OF THIS BOY.

96
00:03:38,676 --> 00:03:40,928
- WELL, THEN JUST TELL HIM THAT 
STEVE HOLT STOPPED BY, OKAY?

97
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:42,472
- OKAY.

98
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:44,474
narrator: HE'D BEEN DUCKING HIM 
EVER SINCE.

99
00:03:44,474 --> 00:03:45,725
- TOM? 
COME ON OVER HERE.

100
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:47,685
I'VE GOT A VITAMIN 
FOR YOU.

101
00:03:47,685 --> 00:03:48,936
HEY, HE'S THE ONE 
WHO CAN'T SEE ME.

102
00:03:48,936 --> 00:03:50,271
- BECAUSE YOU WERE HIDING 
IN THE TRICK?

103
00:03:50,271 --> 00:03:54,108
- ILLUSION, MICHAEL.

104
00:03:54,108 --> 00:03:56,236
I SO VERY MUCH 
WOULD LIKE TO BE...

105
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:58,195
IN YOUR "PROSTATE-ICULAR"--

106
00:03:58,195 --> 00:04:01,115
AS YOUR LOOK-ALIKE. 
- RIGHT.

107
00:04:01,115 --> 00:04:03,200
THEY'RE GONNA SEE THE INK. 
IT'S MORE OF A LEADING MAN ROLE.

108
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,703
BUT IT'S NOT REALLY 
DONE THAT WAY.

109
00:04:05,703 --> 00:04:09,582
- GUESS I SHOULDN'T HAVE 
USED A PERMANENT MARKER.

110
00:04:11,292 --> 00:04:13,544
- STARTING TO SEE WHY 
YOU WANT THAT DIVORCE.

111
00:04:13,544 --> 00:04:16,046
- YEAH, WELL, ACTUALLY, 
I'VE BEEN THINKING.

112
00:04:16,046 --> 00:04:18,090
INSTEAD OF SPENDING MONEY 
ON A DIVORCE--

113
00:04:18,090 --> 00:04:21,761
WHICH CAN BE SLOW-- WELL, MAYBE 
I SHOULD GET SOMETHING FASTER.

114
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:23,888
- NOT THE CAR. 
I SAID NO TO THE VOLVO.

115
00:04:23,888 --> 00:04:25,139
- THE LEXUS.

116
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:27,057
THE VOLVO DIDN'T HAVE SATELLITE 
RADIO, WHICH IS CRAZY.

117
00:04:27,057 --> 00:04:28,601
I MEAN, 
WHAT ARE WE, AMISH?

118
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:29,602
- I KNEW YOU WOULDN'T 
HAVE THE GUTS

119
00:04:29,602 --> 00:04:30,978
TO GO THROUGH WITH THE DIVORCE.

120
00:04:30,978 --> 00:04:32,229
- YOU'RE ONE TO TALK.

121
00:04:32,229 --> 00:04:33,689
YOU HAVEN'T HAD A SERIOUS 
RELATIONSHIP SINCE YOUR WIFE.

122
00:04:33,689 --> 00:04:37,485
AND...YOU GUYS WEREN'T EVEN 
SPEAKING TOWARD THE END.

123
00:04:37,485 --> 00:04:38,736
- LOT OF THAT WAS THE COMA.

124
00:04:38,736 --> 00:04:40,988
- YEAH. 
I'VE HEARD YOUR SIDE OF IT.

125
00:04:40,988 --> 00:04:42,239
[door buzzer]

126
00:04:42,239 --> 00:04:44,158
YOU HAVEN'T HAD THE GUTS 
TO MEET SOMEONE ELSE.

127
00:04:44,158 --> 00:04:45,410
- UH--

128
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:47,995
- LOOK WHO FINALLY GOT 
HIS PANTS ON.

129
00:04:47,995 --> 00:04:50,122
YOU'VE GOT 10 MINUTES.

130
00:04:50,122 --> 00:04:52,166
- YOU GOTTA GET ME OUT OF HERE.

131
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:54,335
- YOU'RE THE ONE 
THAT SAID NO TO PRISON.

132
00:04:54,335 --> 00:04:55,586
- I WAS WRONG.

133
00:04:55,586 --> 00:04:57,338
THERE YOU JUST HAD 
TO SHUT YOUR EYES AND TAKE IT.

134
00:04:57,338 --> 00:04:58,964
HERE YOU HAVE TO SHUT YOUR EYES 
AND GIVE IT.

135
00:04:58,964 --> 00:05:00,341
NOW LISTEN.

136
00:05:00,341 --> 00:05:02,385
WE CAN'T JUST GO IN THERE 
AND PLEAD NOT GUILTY.

137
00:05:02,385 --> 00:05:03,803
WE HAVE TO HAVE SOMEONE BIG 
BEHIND US.

138
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:05,346
OUR OWN PRIVATE MATLOCK.

139
00:05:05,346 --> 00:05:07,348
SO I MADE SOME CALLS, 
AND I GOT HIM.

140
00:05:07,348 --> 00:05:09,642
- GOT WHO? 
- ANDY GRIFFITH.

141
00:05:09,642 --> 00:05:13,354
WHAT, YOU NEVER SAW MATLOCK? 
- NOT A REAL ATTORNEY, DAD.

142
00:05:13,354 --> 00:05:15,356
- NOW, FOR 10 GRAND, 
HE'LL ACTUALLY...

143
00:05:15,356 --> 00:05:17,942
SIT BEHIND US IN COURT 
AND READ THE PAPER.

144
00:05:17,942 --> 00:05:21,195
FOR 15, HE'LL ACTUALLY SIT 
AT THE DEFENSE TABLE.

145
00:05:21,195 --> 00:05:23,864
FOR $20,000, HE'LL TWICE--

146
00:05:23,864 --> 00:05:28,369
[whispering] LEAN FORWARD AND 
WHISPER SOMETHING IN YOUR EAR.

147
00:05:28,369 --> 00:05:30,371
OH. WHITE SUIT-- 
THAT'S EXTRA.

148
00:05:30,371 --> 00:05:31,706
- WELL, THAT'S AN AWFUL LOT 
OF MONEY

149
00:05:31,706 --> 00:05:33,958
FOR THE STUPIDEST 
IDEA I'VE EVER HEARD.

150
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:36,502
- THE JURIES LOVE HIM. 
- THAT'S JUST IT, DAD.

151
00:05:36,502 --> 00:05:40,005
THERE WON'T BE A JURY 
BECAUSE WE ARE PLEADING GUILTY.

152
00:05:40,005 --> 00:05:43,426
- I AM NOT GUILT-- 
I DIDN'T WANT TO TELL YOU THIS.

153
00:05:43,426 --> 00:05:44,677
ARE READY FOR THE BOMBSHELL?

154
00:05:44,677 --> 00:05:46,679
- ANDY GRIFFITH WASN'T 
THE BOMBSHELL?

155
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:50,391
- I'M A PATSY. 
I WAS SET UP...BY THE BRITS.

156
00:05:50,391 --> 00:05:53,978
A GROUP OF BRITISH BUILDERS 
OPERATING OUTSIDE THE O.C.--

157
00:05:53,978 --> 00:05:55,980
- DON'T CALL IT THAT. 
- CONTACTED ME...

158
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:58,399
FOR A PARTNERSHIP 
TO BUILD HOMES OVERSEAS.

159
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:01,318
I DID NOT KNOW THEY MEANT IRAQ.

160
00:06:01,318 --> 00:06:03,153
- WE'VE GOT A PICTURE OF YOU 
WITH SADDAM HUSSEIN.

161
00:06:03,153 --> 00:06:06,323
- I-I THOUGHT THAT WAS THE GUY 
WHO PLAYED THE SOUP NAZI.

162
00:06:06,323 --> 00:06:07,575
- COME ON.

163
00:06:07,575 --> 00:06:08,951
- I TOLD HIM HOW MUCH 
I LIKED HIS WORK.

164
00:06:08,951 --> 00:06:11,704
THE BRITS USED THAT PICTURE 
TO BLACKMAIL ME.

165
00:06:11,704 --> 00:06:14,415
A PICTURE LIKE THAT, MICHAEL, 
CAN END YOUR CAREER.

166
00:06:14,415 --> 00:06:15,416
- NOT IN EVERY CASE.

167
00:06:16,792 --> 00:06:18,043
- THESE ARE DANGEROUS PEOPLE, 
MICHAEL.

168
00:06:18,043 --> 00:06:19,211
THEY'LL DO WHATEVER IT TAKES...

169
00:06:19,211 --> 00:06:21,506
TO GET INSIDE THIS FAMILY 
AND JUST BRING US DOWN.

170
00:06:21,506 --> 00:06:22,757
- BRITISH PEOPLE.

171
00:06:22,757 --> 00:06:25,468
- OH, THEY'RE POLITE 
AND THE MEN ALL SOUND GAY,

172
00:06:25,468 --> 00:06:28,095
BUT THEY WILL RIP OUT 
YOUR HEART AND--

173
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:29,346
THEIR BREATH--

174
00:06:29,346 --> 00:06:31,181
- AND YOU WANT TO GO 
AFTER THESE PEOPLE?

175
00:06:31,181 --> 00:06:33,726
- WELL, YES, IT TAKES 
A LITTLE COURAGE, MICHAEL.

176
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:35,770
I KNOW THAT'S NOT 
YOUR STRONGEST SUIT.

177
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:39,148
YOU'RE--YOU'RE EVEN SCARED TO 
ASK A GIRL OUT ON A DATE.

178
00:06:39,148 --> 00:06:42,067
- WH-- WHY DOES EVERYBODY THINK 
THAT I'M SCARED OF GIRLS?

179
00:06:42,067 --> 00:06:43,277
- BECAUSE YOU'RE A CHICKEN. 
YOU'RE A CHICKEN.

180
00:06:43,277 --> 00:06:44,403
- NO, I'M NOT.

181
00:06:44,403 --> 00:06:48,991
- [imitates chicken] 
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

182
00:06:48,991 --> 00:06:51,243
- MICHAEL AND WOMEN? 
[imitates chicken]

183
00:06:51,243 --> 00:06:52,620
- THAT'S WHAT I WAS JUST 
TELLING HIM.

184
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:53,996
[imitating chickens]

185
00:06:53,996 --> 00:06:55,998
- LOOK, I HAVEN'T FOUND 
THE RIGHT GIRL.

186
00:06:55,998 --> 00:06:58,000
WHEN I DO, 
I WILL ASK HER OUT.

187
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,920
HAS ANYONE IN THIS FAMILY 
EVER EVEN SEEN A CHICKEN?

188
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:03,005
- WAIT, WAIT. 
I'VE GOT THE PERFECT THING.

189
00:07:03,005 --> 00:07:05,508
- THAT'S ENOUGH. 
I WILL GIVE IT ONE DAY.

190
00:07:05,508 --> 00:07:06,759
ALL RIGHT?

191
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:08,427
I'LL SEE IF THERE'S ANY EVIDENCE 
OF THESE NEFARIOUS BRITS.

192
00:07:08,427 --> 00:07:11,597
BUT I'M WARNING YOU-- IF I 
CAN'T, WE'RE PLEADING GUILTY.

193
00:07:11,597 --> 00:07:12,848
YOU'RE EITHER GOING TO JAIL,

194
00:07:12,848 --> 00:07:15,017
OF IF THE JUDGE SHOWS 
ABSOLUTELY NO MERCY AT ALL,

195
00:07:15,017 --> 00:07:17,186
YOU'LL BE STAYING HERE 
WITH MY MOTHER.

196
00:07:17,186 --> 00:07:18,896
LINDSAY, I DIDN'T WANT 
TO TELL YOU EARLIER,

197
00:07:18,896 --> 00:07:20,022
BUT I DID GET YOU A CAR.

198
00:07:20,022 --> 00:07:22,733
- IS IT THE LEXUS? 
- IT'S MORE LIKE A LINCOLN.

199
00:07:22,733 --> 00:07:26,571
[imitating chicken]

200
00:07:31,075 --> 00:07:33,160
OH, COME ON!

201
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,411
- THERE'S NO SATELLITE RADIO,

202
00:07:34,411 --> 00:07:36,080
BUT THERE'S A BANJO 
IN THE CLOSET.

203
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,458
AND WATCH OUT 
FOR LIVE-INS.

204
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:41,043
YOU WILL GET SOME LIVE-INS.

205
00:07:50,177 --> 00:07:51,637
narrator: MICHAEL WAS 
INVESTIGATING

206
00:07:51,637 --> 00:07:52,805
HIS FATHER'S CASE...

207
00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:55,641
IN THE ENGLISH SECTION 
OF ORANGE COUNTY.

208

- LANES REVERSE! 
[tires squealing]

209
00:07:57,685 --> 00:08:00,521
YOU'RE DRIVING ON THE WRONG 
SIDE, YOU BLOOMIN' IDIOT!

210
00:08:00,521 --> 00:08:02,439
- I NEED TO CHECK 
THE RECORDS...

211
00:08:02,439 --> 00:08:04,399
FOR ANY BRITISH-OWNED 
BUILDING BUSINESSES...

212
00:08:04,399 --> 00:08:07,027
THAT WOULD HAVE APPLIED FOR 
LICENSE ABOUT 10 YEARS AGO.

213
00:08:07,027 --> 00:08:08,278
- OH, I'M SO SORRY.

214
00:08:08,278 --> 00:08:11,532
YOU NEED A U.K. PASSPORT 
TO CHECK THOSE FILES.

215
00:08:11,532 --> 00:08:14,368
THEY'RE FOR BRITISH EYES ONLY.

216

FOR BRITISH EYES ONLY

217
00:08:16,328 --> 00:08:18,288
- DON'T I LOOK KIND OF BRITISH?

218
00:08:18,288 --> 00:08:20,500

TO LOSE 20 POUNDS.

narrator: THE CLERK WAS ASKING 
FOR A BRIBE,

220
00:08:22,459 --> 00:08:23,711
BUT THIS WAS LOST 
ON MICHAEL.

221
00:08:23,711 --> 00:08:26,338
- YOU GUYS DO GO FOR THE 
JUGULAR.

222
00:08:26,338 --> 00:08:28,674
- IF YOU FIND SOMEONE WITH A 
PASSPORT, WE'RE HERE TILL 8:00--

223
00:08:28,674 --> 00:08:31,468
AND DO STAY FOR THE POPPINS.

00:08:31,468 --> 00:08:33,513
narrator: SO MICHAEL WENT 
TO THE LOCAL PUB--

225
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:34,764
- BLOODY YANK!

00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:36,015
narrator: TO SEE IF HE COULD 
FIND SOMEONE...

227
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:38,601
WITH A BRITISH PASSPORT. 
- WELCOME TO THE YELLOW FANG.

228
00:08:38,601 --> 00:08:41,103
I AM LIONEL, AND THE SOUP 
OF THE DAY IS--

229
00:08:41,103 --> 00:08:43,397
WHAT'S THE SOUP 
OF THE DAY, MUM?

230
00:08:43,397 --> 00:08:44,649
- BREAD.

231
00:08:44,649 --> 00:08:46,734
- AND THE SOUP OF THE DAY 
IS BREAD--

232
00:08:46,734 --> 00:08:48,318
UNLESS YOU'RE JUST HERE 
FOR THE POPPINS.

233
00:08:48,318 --> 00:08:50,070
narrator: AND THAT'S 
WHEN MICHAEL SAW THE MOST

234
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:52,865
BEAUTIFUL WOMAN HE'D EVER SEEN.

235
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:54,324
NOT HER.

236
00:08:54,324 --> 00:08:56,326
WAIT FOR IT.

237
00:09:02,917 --> 00:09:05,044
- A-ARE YOU FROM WEE BRITAIN?

238
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:07,087
- GREAT BRITAIN, ACTUALLY.

239
00:09:07,087 --> 00:09:08,673
- I-I WAS WONDERING IF YOU MIGHT 
BE WILLING

240
00:09:08,673 --> 00:09:10,174
TO GO SOMEWHERE WITH ME.

241
00:09:10,174 --> 00:09:14,136
I-I WILL PAY YOU. 
- YOU'LL PAY ME?

242
00:09:14,136 --> 00:09:15,387
- NOT--NOT FOR SEX.

243
00:09:15,387 --> 00:09:17,890
YOU'RE GONNA THINK 
THAT I'M JACK THE RIPPER, RIGHT?

244
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:19,224
DIDN'T HE KILL 
PROSTITUTES OR--

245
00:09:19,224 --> 00:09:21,518
- I'M NOT A PROSTITUTE.

246
00:09:21,518 --> 00:09:24,479
THEN I SHALL LET YOU LIVE. 
[chuckles]

247
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:27,692
THIS IS MY WORST HELLO. 
LET ME TRY AGAIN.

248
00:09:27,692 --> 00:09:29,526
MY NAME IS MICHAEL. 
- RITA.

249
00:09:29,526 --> 00:09:31,528

TO THESE FILES...

250
00:09:31,528 --> 00:09:33,906
THAT ARE APPARENTLY 
FOR BRITISH EYES ONLY.

251

MY WHOLE FACE IS BRITISH.

00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:44,625
I REALLY APPRECIATE-- 
HELLO.

255
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:46,293
I THOUGHT YOU SAID 
YOU WERE OPEN TILL 8:00.

256
00:09:46,293 --> 00:09:47,336

257
00:09:47,336 --> 00:09:50,130
EVERYTHING HERE 
IS ON GREENWICH MEAN TIME.

258

259
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,051
UH-- WAIT, WAIT, RITA.

260
00:09:54,051 --> 00:09:56,846
I DON'T SUPPOSE THAT YOU'RE 
HERE TOMORROW MORNING?

261
00:09:56,846 --> 00:09:58,097
- OH, NO. 
NOT IN THE MORNING, NO.

262
00:09:58,097 --> 00:09:59,932
I'LL BE BACK AT SLOWBROOKE.

263
00:09:59,932 --> 00:10:01,308

SCHOOL.

264
00:10:01,308 --> 00:10:02,977
YOU TEACH KIDS, HUH?

265
00:10:02,977 --> 00:10:05,145
- I LIKE TO THINK 
THEY TEACH ME.

266
00:10:05,145 --> 00:10:07,022

EAT CRAYONS, THROW TANTRUMS--

267
00:10:07,022 --> 00:10:08,023
- OH, NO.

268
00:10:08,023 --> 00:10:10,025
NOT WHEN I'M THERE. 
I'M VERY GOOD.

269
00:10:10,025 --> 00:10:14,113

YOUR ABILITY OR, UH--

270
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:16,741
IT'S TURNING INTO 
ONE OF MY WORST GOOD-BYES.

271
00:10:16,741 --> 00:10:19,034
FAREWELL, AND, UH,

IT'S WRONG TO LAUGH.

I WAS JUST GONNA ASK YOU--

284
00:10:44,101 --> 00:10:46,103
PRE-SCHOOLS JUST GO 
HALF DAY, RIGHT?

00:10:46,103 --> 00:10:47,354
I'M NOT TRYING TO PICK YOU UP,

PICK YOU UP, 
BRING YOU HERE?

BRITISH MAN.

330
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:33,878
- IT'S MICHAEL. 
I'M NOT DRESSED.

331
00:12:33,878 --> 00:12:36,463
- GOB, THIS IS MICHAEL.

332
00:12:36,463 --> 00:12:38,715
SHOULDN'T YOU BE GETTING READY 
FOR YOUR "FREE BIRD" TRICK?

333
00:12:38,715 --> 00:12:40,342
- I COULDN'T GET THE RIGHTS 
TO "FREE BIRD."

334
00:12:40,342 --> 00:12:41,385
- OH.

335
00:12:41,385 --> 00:12:42,511
- I'M THINKING ABOUT 
CALLING IT "FREE"--

336
00:12:42,511 --> 00:12:43,595
I DON'T KNOW. 
CHICKEN.

337
00:12:43,595 --> 00:12:44,679
I THOUGHT YOU WERE

338
00:12:44,679 --> 00:12:46,473
INVESTIGATING DAD'S 
SINISTER BRITISH CONNECTION.

339
00:12:46,473 --> 00:12:48,517
- YEAH. I, UH, TRIED, 
BUT, UH,

340
00:12:48,517 --> 00:12:50,519
WHEN I WAS LEAVING,

341
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:51,770
ONE OF THOSE BRITISH GUYS

342
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:53,730
CAME AFTER ME AND TOLD ME 
TO BACK OFF.

343
00:12:53,730 --> 00:12:55,900
CAN'T BELIEVE IT, BUT DAD MAY 
HAVE BEEN TELLING THE TRUTH.

344
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,151
THIS MIGHT BE DANGEROUS.

345
00:12:57,151 --> 00:12:58,777
- SO YOU CAME BACK HERE 
TO HIDE LIKE A CHILD.

346
00:12:58,777 --> 00:13:00,737
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING 
LOCKED IN MY OFFICE, EXACTLY?

347
00:13:00,737 --> 00:13:03,198
- HIDING FROM A CHILD. 
BIG DIFFERENCE.

348
00:13:03,198 --> 00:13:04,658
- GOB, STEVE HOLT IS YOUR SON.

349
00:13:04,658 --> 00:13:05,910
HE PROBABLY JUST FEELS 
A CONNECTION.

350
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:07,244
- HE DOESN'T KNOW WHAT HE FEELS.

351
00:13:07,244 --> 00:13:10,539
I'M TRIED OF BEING TOLD.

352
00:13:10,539 --> 00:13:13,458
MY GOD. 
WHAT IS THIS FEELING?

353
00:13:13,458 --> 00:13:15,502
- YOU KNOW, THE FEELING 
THAT YOU'RE--

354
00:13:15,502 --> 00:13:18,713
THAT YOU'RE FEELING, IT'S JUST 
WHAT MANY OF US CALL A FEELING.

355
00:13:18,713 --> 00:13:20,715
- IT'S NOT LIKE ENVY--

356
00:13:20,715 --> 00:13:23,718
OR EVEN HUNGRY. 
- COULD IT BE LOVE?

357
00:13:23,718 --> 00:13:25,470
- I KNOW WHAT AN ERECTION 
FEELS LIKE, MICHAEL.

358
00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:27,097
NO. 
IT'S THE OPPOSITE.

359
00:13:27,097 --> 00:13:30,350
IT'S LIKE MY HEART 
IS GETTING HARD.

360
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:33,187
MAYBE I AM READY 
TO BE A FATHER.

361
00:13:33,187 --> 00:13:35,355
- HEY, DAD? 
- WHOA!

362
00:13:35,355 --> 00:13:37,357
- IT'S MY SON, GOB.

363
00:13:37,357 --> 00:13:39,484
YOU KNOW, AND WHAT IS IT WITH 
THE FATHERS IN THIS FAMILY

364
00:13:39,484 --> 00:13:41,153
ALWAYS TRYING TO DECEIVE THEIR--

365
00:13:41,153 --> 00:13:43,488
narrator: AND THAT'S WHEN 
MICHAEL REALIZED THAT THE MAN...

366
00:13:43,488 --> 00:13:46,283
WHO THREATENED HIM MUST HAVE 
BEEN HIRED BY GEORGE SR.

367
00:13:46,283 --> 00:13:49,411
- I'M THE PATSY.

368
00:13:49,411 --> 00:13:51,496
WELL, I GOTTA GO. 
GEORGE MICHAEL?

369
00:13:51,496 --> 00:13:54,541
I'M SORRY, BUT WE'RE GONNA TALK 
ABOUT THAT GIRL LATER, OKAY?

370
00:13:54,541 --> 00:13:56,543
- NOW ALL I HAVE TO DO IS FIND 
THAT LOOK-ALIKE, MICHAEL.

371
00:13:56,543 --> 00:14:00,130
- MICHAEL?

372
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:03,383
HEY!

373
00:14:03,383 --> 00:14:05,635
- THAT'S A WOMAN'S WIG.

374
00:14:05,635 --> 00:14:09,223
- I WAS TOLD IT WAS A BOB.

375
00:14:10,057 --> 00:14:11,934
- narrator: AND MICHAEL 
CONFRONTED HIS FATHER.

376
00:14:11,934 --> 00:14:13,018
- FIND OUT ANYTHING?

377
00:14:13,018 --> 00:14:14,103
- YEAH, I DID, DAD.

378
00:14:14,103 --> 00:14:15,812
I FOUND OUT NO MATTER HOW MANY 
TIMES I PROMISE MYSELF...

379
00:14:15,812 --> 00:14:17,147
THAT I'M NOT GONNA FALL FOR IT, 
I ALWAYS END UP

380
00:14:17,147 --> 00:14:19,024
GETTING HUSTLED BY YOU. 
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

381
00:14:19,024 --> 00:14:20,442
- THE GUY THAT YOU HIRED 
TO THREATEN ME

382
00:14:20,442 --> 00:14:21,818
AFTER I LOOKED 
INTO THE BRITISH CONNECTION.

383
00:14:21,818 --> 00:14:23,737
- WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT. 
SOMEBODY THREATENED YOU?

384
00:14:23,737 --> 00:14:24,821
- IT'S A WONDERFUL PERFORMANCE, 
DAD.

385
00:14:24,821 --> 00:14:26,115
YOU'RE A REGULAR BRAD GARRETT.

386
00:14:26,115 --> 00:14:27,908
BUT I DON'T WATCH TV 
AT 3:00 IN THE AFTERNOON,

387
00:14:27,908 --> 00:14:29,743
AND YOU CAN FORGET 
ABOUT PLEADING NOT GUILTY.

388
00:14:29,743 --> 00:14:32,412
- GUILTY. WE GOTTA PLEAD GUILTY. 
- WHAT?

389
00:14:32,412 --> 00:14:34,789
- MICHAEL, I DIDN'T HIRE ANYONE, 
I-I-I--I SWEAR.

390
00:14:34,789 --> 00:14:37,834
IF SOMEONE CAME AFTER YOU, 
THEY'RE FOR REAL.

391
00:14:37,834 --> 00:14:39,086
- COME ON. 
YOU SERIOUS?

392
00:14:39,086 --> 00:14:40,795
- I TOLD YOU. 
THESE ARE BAD GUYS.

393
00:14:40,795 --> 00:14:43,382
THEY DO NOT WANT 
THIS INFORMATION OUT.

394
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:44,799
- HE SAID HE WAS GONNA 
COME AFTER SOMEBODY STUPID

395
00:14:44,799 --> 00:14:46,051
IN OUR FAMILY.

396
00:14:46,051 --> 00:14:47,136
THAT COULD BE BUSTER.

397
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:48,470
- [inhales sharply] 
COULD BE GOB.

398
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:51,431
- YOU'RE NOT GUILTY. 
- WE HAVE TO PLEAD GUILTY.

399
00:14:51,431 --> 00:14:52,682
- WE GOTTA PLEAD GUILTY.

400
00:14:52,682 --> 00:14:54,434
- WE GOTTA THROW OURSELVES 
ON THE MERCY OF THE COURT.

401
00:14:54,434 --> 00:14:57,938
- WE GOTTA GET ANDY GRIFFITH. 
- IN THE SUIT.

402
00:14:57,938 --> 00:15:00,107
narrator: AND MICHAEL WENT 
TO CANCEL WITH RITA.

403
00:15:00,107 --> 00:15:02,442
- SORRY. I JUST WANTED 
TO LET YOU KNOW...

404
00:15:02,442 --> 00:15:05,195
THAT I'M NOT GONNA BE NEEDING 
YOUR PASSPORT AFTER ALL.

405
00:15:05,195 --> 00:15:06,863
WE'RE JUST GONNA GO TO COURT, 
PLEAD GUILTY.

406
00:15:06,863 --> 00:15:07,907
THAT'LL BE THAT.

407
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:09,033
- SO IT'S BYE-BYE TO RITA, THEN?

408
00:15:09,033 --> 00:15:11,410
- YES, I'LL SHAKE YOUR HAND 
GOOD-BYE,

409
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:14,997
BUT, ACTUALLY, I WAS WONDERING 
IF YOU MIGHT WANT TO--

410
00:15:14,997 --> 00:15:18,458
- I WOULDN'T. 
I'LL MAKE YOU BLUE.

411
00:15:18,458 --> 00:15:21,461
narrator: RITA WAS JUST TALKING 
ABOUT THE FINGER PAINT,

412
00:15:21,461 --> 00:15:23,672
BUT MICHAEL DIDN'T KNOW THAT. 
- I WAS JUST WONDERING...

413
00:15:23,672 --> 00:15:27,551
IF YOU MIGHT WANT TO BID ME 
FAIR MORROW.

414
00:15:27,551 --> 00:15:31,471
narrator: MICHAEL WAS FILLED 
WITH SELF-LOATHING.

415
00:15:31,471 --> 00:15:35,600
HAD HE BEEN JACK THE RIPPER, 
HE WOULD HAVE SOOTHED HIMSELF

416
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:38,270
IN A MOST UNSAVORY WAY.

417
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:40,480
BUT INSTEAD HE JUST 
SAT IN HIS CAR...

418
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:43,692
AND ATE A WHOLE THING 
OF CANDY BEANS.

419
00:15:43,692 --> 00:15:44,944
AND BACK AT THE PENTHOUSE,

420
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:47,487
GOB HAD BEEN CALLED 
TO SEE HIS FATHER.

421
00:15:47,487 --> 00:15:49,489
- NEW PLAN, RIGHT?

422
00:15:49,489 --> 00:15:50,740
YOU PUT ME IN THE TRICK.

423
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:52,492
YOU MAKE ME THE GUY 
IN THE CAGE.

424
00:15:52,492 --> 00:15:54,786
- OKAY, I JUST GOTTA SAY I'M 
REALLY BLOWN AWAY BY THIS.

425
00:15:54,786 --> 00:15:58,207
YOU REALLY WANT TO BE PART 
OF MY WORLD.

426
00:15:58,207 --> 00:15:59,458
- I DO.

427
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:02,752
- GOD, I FEEL LIKE MY HEART 
IS STRAINING THROUGH MY SHIRT.

428
00:16:02,752 --> 00:16:05,047
- THEY TAKE THE ANKLE MONITOR 
OFF WHEN I GET TO COURT.

429
00:16:05,047 --> 00:16:08,008
SO, YOU MAKE ME DISAPPEAR, YOU 
PUT TOBIAS IN THE CAGE,

430
00:16:08,008 --> 00:16:11,053
AND BY THE TIME THEY REALIZE 
THAT THAT GUY IS NOT ME,

431
00:16:11,053 --> 00:16:13,680
I'M RUNNING THROUGH THE STORM 
DRAINS TO FREEDOM.

432
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:16,391
- WHERE EVERY DAY IT RAINS...

433
00:16:16,391 --> 00:16:18,978
PENNIES FROM HEAVEN!

434
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,650
THIS...BIRD TODAY--

435
00:16:25,650 --> 00:16:28,695
- GOB, I KNOW YOU'RE LOOKING 
FOR A TWIN FOR YOUR ILLUSION,

436
00:16:28,695 --> 00:16:31,573
AND THERE'S SOMEBODY 
I'D LIKE TO PUT IN A PLUG FOR.

437
00:16:31,573 --> 00:16:35,660
UH-- CORRECTION. 
MAKE THAT 4,000 PLUGS.

438
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:37,537
- OH, GOD! 
- OH, COME ON.

439
00:16:37,537 --> 00:16:39,123
- MR. GAY, HE'S BLEEDING. 
MR. GAY--

440
00:16:39,123 --> 00:16:41,708
- NO, NO, NO, NO-- 
I WAS SCARED TOO,

441
00:16:41,708 --> 00:16:44,836
BUT I REALIZED IT WAS 
OF BEING A LEADING MAN.

442
00:16:44,836 --> 00:16:46,088
OH, I CAN JUST TASTE

443
00:16:46,088 --> 00:16:48,548
THOSE MEATY LEADING-MAN PARTS 
IN MY MOUTH.

444
00:16:48,548 --> 00:16:49,799
- ALL RIGHT, LISTEN TO ME.

445
00:16:49,799 --> 00:16:51,551
THE TRICK HAS CHANGED. 
WE WANT YOU TO PLAY ME NOW.

446
00:16:51,551 --> 00:16:55,264
- OH, BUT THAT WOULD MEAN 
I'D HAVE TO SH--

447
00:16:55,264 --> 00:16:58,017
SHAVE MY VERY... 
TENDER HEAD. I SEE.

448
00:16:58,017 --> 00:17:00,769
OKAY. WELL, PERHAPS 
I JUMPED THE GUN...

449
00:17:00,769 --> 00:17:02,437
ON THOSE NEW HEAD SHOTS.

450
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:05,149
narrator: AND LATER THAT DAY,

451
00:17:05,149 --> 00:17:06,983
MICHAEL ARRIVED AT THE 
COURTHOUSE.

452
00:17:06,983 --> 00:17:09,153
- I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'RE JUST 
GIVING UP LIKE THIS.

453
00:17:09,153 --> 00:17:10,570
- WELL, THE GUY THREATENED OUR 
FAMILY.

00:17:10,570 --> 00:17:11,571
WE HAVE TO PLEAD GUILTY.

455

GIRL

456
00:17:12,739 --> 00:17:13,948
YOU SAID YOU HAVE A DATE WITH.

457
00:17:13,948 --> 00:17:15,492
- ALL RIGHT, SO I LIED. 
IT WASN'T A DATE.

458
00:17:15,492 --> 00:17:17,161
- BUT YOU COULD HAVE 
MADE ONE WITH HER.

459
00:17:17,161 --> 00:17:19,454
I THINK THAT POPPINS KNOCKED THE 
COURAGE OUT OF YOU.

460
00:17:19,454 --> 00:17:21,498
- I GUESS I'M JUST NOT 
IN HER LEAGUE.

461
00:17:21,498 --> 00:17:23,042
HOW DID YOU 
HEAR ABOUT THE POPPINS?

00:17:26,836 --> 00:17:31,425
IS THIS THE WORK 
OF THE ITSY BITSY I.R.A.?

466
00:17:31,425 --> 00:17:32,509
- I DON'T WANT 
TO TALK ABOUT THIS RIGHT NOW.

467
00:17:32,509 --> 00:17:34,053
DAD, WE'RE GONNA GO IN THERE.

- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

472
00:17:40,184 --> 00:17:41,435
- HE DIDN'T LIKE HIS TRAILER.

473
00:17:41,435 --> 00:17:43,228

MAKING FUN OF HIM.

OF ANDY GRIFFITH.

HIS MAGIC SHOW.

508
00:18:51,796 --> 00:18:53,047

AND SOON GEORGE SR. CAME TO, 
AND IT WAS TIME...

00:19:39,553 --> 00:19:41,513
TO RENDER A PLEA.

- I'M TIRED OF THE COWARDICE.

536
00:19:58,947 --> 00:20:00,865
YOU'RE NOT GUILTY. 
WE'RE GONNA FIGHT THIS.

537
00:20:00,865 --> 00:20:04,536
- THEY DON'T HAVE 
A-- [bleep] PRAYER.

538
00:20:04,536 --> 00:20:07,289
SEND THE CHECK 
TO MY ACCOUNTANT.

539
00:20:07,289 --> 00:20:09,458

00:20:12,877 --> 00:20:14,921

AS DANGEROUS AS DAD SAID.

543
00:20:14,921 --> 00:20:16,923
- WELL, THEY'RE NOT GONNA 
GET ANY CLOSER TO US.

544
00:20:16,923 --> 00:20:18,508
IF THEY DO, 
WE'RE GONNA SEE THEM COMING.

545
00:20:18,508 --> 00:20:20,093
OH, MY GOD. 
THAT'S RITA.

546
00:20:20,093 --> 00:20:23,763
I TOLD HER I WAS COMING HERE 
AND SHE CAME.

547
00:20:23,763 --> 00:20:27,267

00:20:27,267 --> 00:20:30,937

554
00:20:44,743 --> 00:20:46,870
JUST TO PROVE TO HIMSELF HE 
WASN'T A COWARD,

555
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:49,038
HE WENT ONE STEP FURTHER.

556
00:20:52,376 --> 00:20:58,214
AND RITA WAS HAPPY TO BE IN 
MICHAEL'S LIFE AS WELL.

557
00:20:58,214 --> 00:21:02,010
FOR YOU SEE, RITA 
HAD A SECRET OF HER OWN.
