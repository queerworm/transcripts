-that I'm the one who started that?
-[Lucille] Well, that's true,

[Mimi] All right.
The trophy can be your prize.

-with Uncle Jack this year?
-Uh, no. No.

70
00:03:15,236 --> 00:03:16,946
Jack dumped me. [sniffles]

73

Ah, well, anyway,
I just thought the cruise

74
00:03:24,162 --> 00:03:26,456
would be the perfect gift
for whoever wins.

75
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:29,125
I know what you're up to.

76
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:31,169
You're not taking Lindsay.

77
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:35,924
Well, soon, Lindsay will be old enough
to make that decision for herself.

78
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:38,551
And I know you won't let me take Buster.

79
00:03:38,635 --> 00:03:41,512
My God, when he was three years old,
you still had him on a leash! [laughs]

a murderer out of that one."

Oh, but we're getting ahead of ourselves!
Let's see who wins the competition.

00:03:48,019 --> 00:03:49,270
And I can be a judge.

83
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:53,149
Never too early to get Buster used
to being in front of a judge.

00:07:12,014 --> 00:07:13,850
-We're gonna need it in a month.
-You're fired.

163
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:17,937
Which, because of the merger,
he had the right to do, but don't worry.

164
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:20,606
The wall's gonna be fine. Gob's on it.

165
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:22,733
I don't want George Michael
feeling guilty,

166
00:07:22,817 --> 00:07:24,819
so I told Gob,
when it comes to the foot,

167
00:07:24,902 --> 00:07:27,196
-that mum's the word.
-[Ron] <i>Although "clear" might've been</i>

168
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,614
<i>-an overstatement.</i>
-It was a great move

169
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:31,409
to get rid<i> </i>of your dad.
Can't let fear run a business.

170
00:07:31,492 --> 00:07:32,702
How do you mean, fear?

171
00:07:33,369 --> 00:07:35,872
Well, you get sent one severed foot
from the Chinese,

172
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:37,832
and, all of a sudden,
you turn into a crybaby.

173
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:40,668
The Chinese sent my dad
a severed human foot?

174
00:07:40,751 --> 00:07:42,712
Yeah. Although they call it a "mum."

175
00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:46,340
Mum's the word
for "severed human foot" in Chinese.

176
00:07:46,424 --> 00:07:48,468
I don't even know how I know that.
But it's to ensure

177
00:07:48,551 --> 00:07:50,511
that he finishes building the wall
or whatever.

178
00:07:50,595 --> 00:07:54,056
It's like, you know what?
Like, call me after you've been lured down

179
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:55,850
to a rock quarry,
and someone threatens

180
00:07:55,933 --> 00:07:57,477
to ruin your magic career

181
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:00,480
if you go to gay conversion therapy,
and it works. [chuckles]

182
00:08:00,563 --> 00:08:03,399
I mean, seriously, call me after that,

183
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:06,235
because I'd be curious
to see how-- how you'd handle it.

184
00:08:07,028 --> 00:08:09,572
[Lucille] <i>Well, having a child</i>
<i>try to embarrass you</i>

185
00:08:09,655 --> 00:08:11,699
is part of parenting, sweetheart.

186
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:15,912
Mine's chained to a bench.
So, in that sense, he's an overachiever.

187
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:17,288
-[door opens]
-[CJ] All rise.

188
00:08:17,371 --> 00:08:20,082
The Superior Court
of Orange County is now in session.

189
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:23,211
The Honorable Judge Spencer Stanley
presiding.

190
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:24,962
Please be seated.

191
00:08:25,296 --> 00:08:28,174
-CJ, let me get to the chair.
-[CJ] Sorry.

192
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:30,801
[Stanley] Does Defense have
a counsel ready?

193
00:08:30,927 --> 00:08:33,596
Uh... not quite yet, Your Honor.

194
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:36,724
Someone care to explain to me why
there's no one to represent the client?

195
00:08:36,807 --> 00:08:40,436
-[upbeat theme music playing]
-They're here! The Guilty Guys are here.

196
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41,812
Oh, it's the Guilty Guys?

197
00:08:41,896 --> 00:08:43,773
They're here. They're actually here.

198
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:45,650
-They're coming down the hall.
-[CJ] All rise

199
00:08:45,733 --> 00:08:48,361
-for the Guilty Guys.
-CJ, you don't have to... [sighs]

200
00:08:48,819 --> 00:08:51,489
Okay, great. Now I can't see.

201
00:08:51,572 --> 00:08:54,492
[Ron] <i>And so,</i>
<i>perhaps as an intimidation tactic,</i>

202
00:08:54,575 --> 00:08:56,619
<i>the Guilty Guys finally arrived,</i>

203
00:08:57,203 --> 00:08:59,747
<i>the fruits</i>
<i>of their very expensive preparation</i>

204
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:00,957
<i>on full display.</i>

205
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:04,168
<i>It was hard for anyone</i>
<i>not to get caught up in the pageantry.</i>

206
00:09:04,252 --> 00:09:05,211
Uh, Barry?

207
00:09:06,337 --> 00:09:07,797
[cart squeaks]

208
00:09:08,756 --> 00:09:10,758
[Stanley] On the count
of murder in the first degree,

209
00:09:10,925 --> 00:09:12,468
how does the defendant plead?

210
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:17,014
-[Anita clears throat]
-Your Honor, in the case

211
00:09:17,098 --> 00:09:19,725
of <i>The State of California</i>
<i>v. Buster Bluth,</i>

212
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:22,019
we'd like to enter a plea of... guilty.

213
00:09:22,103 --> 00:09:25,106
Hmm. Okay. Let's set a date
for a sentencing presentation.

214
00:09:25,856 --> 00:09:29,026
And on a personal note,
I just want to say that it is not often

215
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:31,988
in the course of a jurisprudence career
that a judge has the...

216
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:34,699
-I want to say privilege...
-Sorry. Did...

217
00:09:34,782 --> 00:09:36,951
Did-- Did you say... Did they say guilty?

218
00:09:37,702 --> 00:09:39,662
[Barry] Look at that.
There is always a guy

219
00:09:39,745 --> 00:09:41,664
who wants to know what's going on.

220
00:09:41,747 --> 00:09:42,832
It's why I could never go

221
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:44,834
-to the movies with my father.
-Hello? Not!

222
00:09:45,668 --> 00:09:47,712
We'd like to plead <i>not </i>guilty, Your Honor.

223
00:09:48,045 --> 00:09:50,798
Not guilty?
You hired <i>us </i>to plead not guilty?

224
00:09:50,881 --> 00:09:52,508
[scoffs] Well, that's a first.

225
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:54,510
-[Michael] Barry, what's going on?
-[Barry] Yeah?

226
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:55,678
[Michael] What's happening?

227
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:57,930
You didn't want to plead guilty?

228
00:09:58,431 --> 00:10:00,891
Of course not! Buster's not guilty.

229
00:10:01,517 --> 00:10:03,102
Well, then, these are not the guys.

230
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:05,062
No, I thought I told you that

231
00:10:05,146 --> 00:10:07,607
if I was guilty,
then I would hire these guys,

232
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:09,358
'cause they get the best sentences.

233
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:13,029
You're saying
these guys cannot represent us

234
00:10:13,112 --> 00:10:14,614
in-- in a not guilty plea?

235
00:10:14,697 --> 00:10:16,198
Why would you want to pay them
for two months?

236
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:18,701
I don't think they've ever been
on a case that long.

237
00:10:18,784 --> 00:10:20,703
[Ron] <i>Which was</i>
<i>the same problem the producers</i>

238
00:10:20,786 --> 00:10:23,623
<i>of the Netflix series had,</i>
<i>and actually why it was canceled</i>

239
00:10:23,706 --> 00:10:25,207
-<i>before the end of the main title.</i>
-Your Honor,

240
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:26,917
we'd like to enter a plea of...

241
00:10:27,251 --> 00:10:28,085
guilty.

242
00:10:30,254 --> 00:10:32,840
{\an8}-Oh, honest to God, Barry...
-[Barry] Okay.

243
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:34,300
Okay, let me take care of this.

244
00:10:34,592 --> 00:10:38,387
Can I just ask,
would you mind staying on the case

245
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:39,555
if it's not guilty?

246
00:10:40,765 --> 00:10:43,434
-Sidebar, please. Sidebar.
<i>-</i>[Ron] <i>And, true to their reputation,</i>

247
00:10:43,517 --> 00:10:44,602
<i>this pivotal moment</i>

248
00:10:44,685 --> 00:10:46,395
<i>would also prove anti-climactic.</i>

249
00:10:46,604 --> 00:10:48,606
-Hey, yeah, we're out. We just can't...
-Really?

250
00:10:48,689 --> 00:10:50,775
-We can't defend their son. Bye.
-[sighs]

251
00:10:51,359 --> 00:10:53,569
-[all cheering and whooping]
-[Jack] Yeah! Yes!

252
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:55,237
-Yes!
-[Shara] We did it!

253
00:10:55,571 --> 00:10:58,074
They're out.
We won't be hearing from them again.

254
00:10:58,199 --> 00:11:00,576
Except for what they're gonna charge us
for the phone call.

255
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,870
-They've never technically won a case...
-Mm-hmm.

256
00:11:02,953 --> 00:11:04,830
...but they've never lost a fee.

257
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:07,124
Of course,
the bad news is Lottie is pushing

258
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:08,668
to get this on the docket
within the month.

259
00:11:09,126 --> 00:11:11,671
-But we don't have an attorney.
-[Barry] Well, that's what I said.

260
00:11:11,754 --> 00:11:13,214
This DA, she is a killer.

261
00:11:13,547 --> 00:11:16,258
She has never lost a case.
Well, just once.

262
00:11:16,801 --> 00:11:18,844
But then,
her ex was the opposing counsel.

263
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:21,263
Well, that's our answer.
We gotta get him as our attorney.

264
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:22,890
Oh, no. He's retired.

265
00:11:23,307 --> 00:11:25,643
Which is too bad,
because she was so flustered

266
00:11:25,726 --> 00:11:27,853
by his argument,
she called for a mistrial.

267
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:31,649
I have never seen Lottie Dottie cower
like that before.

268
00:11:31,732 --> 00:11:34,276
Of course,
she was called Lottie Radler back then.

269
00:11:34,652 --> 00:11:36,112
-Lottie Radler?
-Yeah.

270
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:38,364
What's her ex-husband's name?

271
00:11:39,407 --> 00:11:42,284
-Dustin.
-Uh-uh. She means <i>Lottie's </i>ex.

272
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:45,037
Dustin Radler, the guy you're dating.

273
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:46,580
No, it can't be.

274
00:11:46,664 --> 00:11:49,083
I mean, he said he was retired, but,

275
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:52,420
uh... I have to get him on this case.

276
00:11:52,503 --> 00:11:55,172
Well, I don't think
he's gonna do it for free.

277
00:11:55,464 --> 00:11:57,174
I'll let him move in.
That's what he wants.

278
00:11:57,258 --> 00:12:00,720
No, no, no, no.
You're so close to ending it with him.

279
00:12:00,803 --> 00:12:03,180
I mean, I--
You don't want to be leading him on.

280
00:12:03,931 --> 00:12:05,474
We have to get our son off,

281
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:08,644
and in three weeks,
a mistrial is the only thing in our favor.

282
00:12:08,936 --> 00:12:10,187
So that's my choice?

283
00:12:10,855 --> 00:12:13,107
Between my wife and my son?

284
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:14,608
[Barry] Isn't that the worst?

285
00:12:14,692 --> 00:12:16,694
Especially when you're checking
into a hotel.

286
00:12:16,777 --> 00:12:19,113
Here's my advice.
Always say that he's your wife,

287
00:12:19,196 --> 00:12:21,073
'cause they never have the balls to check.

288
00:12:23,325 --> 00:12:25,119
I'm out of context again, aren't I?

289
00:12:27,955 --> 00:12:29,206
[quietly] I'm so sorry.

290
00:12:31,792 --> 00:12:34,086
[Ron] <i>After firing his father,</i>
<i>George Michael</i>

291
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:36,172
<i>was visited by Maeby,</i>

292
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:38,215
<i>who had father problems of her own.</i>

293
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:40,968
[Maeby] ...about being a backup person
in the Blue Man Group,

294
00:12:41,302 --> 00:12:44,138
when he realizes that Marge is over,
so of course he yells,

295
00:12:44,513 --> 00:12:47,057
"Voices up."
And then I gotta hear Mrs. Featherbottom

296
00:12:47,141 --> 00:12:50,436
cover by saying she meant
"makeup," not "backup" person,

297
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:52,897
and then go on to brag that,
for four years,

298
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:54,482
she blew three men five times a day,

299
00:12:54,565 --> 00:12:56,150
and now we've been called
before the board

300
00:12:56,233 --> 00:12:59,403
-for the third time.
-Well, why don't you ask them to move out?

301
00:12:59,487 --> 00:13:02,114
It's not that easy.
Remember when your dad lived with you?

302
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:05,993
Oh, yeah. Yeah,
we had to do some crazy vote-out thing

303
00:13:06,076 --> 00:13:09,205
where he... he forgot how voting worked.
He voted for himself.

304
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:12,291
[Ron] <i>In fact,</i>
<i>it was a deeply complicated plan</i>

305
00:13:12,374 --> 00:13:14,877
<i>that required Michael believing</i>
<i>he was voting out</i>

306
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:18,255
<i>a third roommate, only to discover</i>

307
00:13:18,547 --> 00:13:20,466
<i>that the three turned on him...</i>

308
00:13:20,841 --> 00:13:23,010
Michael. Michael. Michael.

309
00:13:23,844 --> 00:13:25,638
[Ron] <i>...leading to a sense of betrayal</i>

310
00:13:25,721 --> 00:13:28,766
<i>that neither father nor son</i>
<i>would soon recover from.</i>

311
00:13:28,849 --> 00:13:31,018
[Maeby] <i>Oh.</i>
<i>I just remember it working, so,</i>

312
00:13:31,101 --> 00:13:32,311
maybe a vote will do it.

313
00:13:32,853 --> 00:13:34,104
But you better watch out,

314
00:13:34,188 --> 00:13:36,148
because the gang's gonna try
and live with you

315
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:38,734
-at Sudden Valley.
-Well, with all the construction going on

316
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:40,444
right now, they wouldn't get through.

317
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,071
Construction for what?

318
00:13:43,239 --> 00:13:44,073
The wall.

319
00:13:44,532 --> 00:13:47,117
You're building the wall?
I thought that's why you fired your dad.

320
00:13:47,785 --> 00:13:49,620
Yeah, well, that was before I realized...

321
00:13:49,995 --> 00:13:51,372
there was something else...

322
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:52,998
afoot.

323
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,502
George Michael, you can't do that.

324
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:58,796
Building that wall is gonna affect
real people.

325
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:00,714
[George Michael] I don't have the luxury
of worrying about that.

326
00:14:00,798 --> 00:14:02,299
Someone's gotta protect this family.

327
00:14:02,383 --> 00:14:03,926
Well, what about <i>their </i>families?

328
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:06,887
I got to know some of those people
when I was working in that border town,

329
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:08,472
acting like I was getting to know
those people.

330
00:14:08,556 --> 00:14:11,225
You sound just like
a slightly self-aware Aunt Lindsay.

331
00:14:11,308 --> 00:14:14,144
Well, you sound
just like a minimally-woke Uncle Michael.

332
00:14:14,228 --> 00:14:16,564
I'm not gonna go into this,
because I don't want you getting involved,

333
00:14:16,647 --> 00:14:17,898
but we're building the wall.

334
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:21,110
Fine. Abandon your morals.

335
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:24,029
Build your dumb wall.
Appease your dumb guilt

336
00:14:24,113 --> 00:14:26,365
at firing your father
because of his dumb investment.

337
00:14:26,448 --> 00:14:29,118
It's not dumb. He's the only person
who ever believed in this company.

338
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:31,829
Which isn't real, so that makes it dumb.

339
00:14:32,121 --> 00:14:34,206
You know what?
I don't even care anymore, though.

340
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:36,250
It'll be you who's guilty of fraud.

341
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:38,335
But, hey,
maybe you can get those dumb attorneys

342
00:14:38,419 --> 00:14:40,754
from that short Netflix show
that's not on the air anymore.

343
00:14:41,755 --> 00:14:42,840
[man] They canceled that?

344
00:14:43,007 --> 00:14:46,051
[Ron] <i>Lucille was attempting</i>

345
00:14:46,135 --> 00:14:48,012
<i>Dusty, after revealing to him</i>

346
00:14:48,095 --> 00:14:50,264
<i>that she now knew</i>
<i>about his relationship</i>

347
00:14:50,347 --> 00:14:51,974

348
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:54,018
-Da.
-Da.

349
00:14:54,351 --> 00:14:57,354
Da! Oh, I knew you'd find out eventually.

350
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:00,232
I mean, I haven't exactly been
in a courtroom for--

351
00:15:00,316 --> 00:15:02,067
For several years, I know.

352
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:04,111
I wouldn't ask if I had other options.

353
00:15:04,194 --> 00:15:06,655
-Look, I don't want to take advantage...
-[sighs]

354
00:15:07,031 --> 00:15:10,284
...but your ex wants to make sure
my son can never truly be free

355
00:15:10,367 --> 00:15:13,037
in his life, and maybe you think
I'm an overbearing mother,

356
00:15:13,454 --> 00:15:15,956
but I will not let this DA take my job.

357
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:18,876
I think you're a very caring mother.

358
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:20,920
In fact, I'll go one step further.

359
00:15:21,003 --> 00:15:24,048
I think this is
how a mother's supposed to act.

360
00:15:24,131 --> 00:15:26,759
Oh, so she's not as sweet
as she seems, is she?

361
00:15:26,842 --> 00:15:27,927
Trust me, it's all an act.

362
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:30,346
She's not even interested in children.

363
00:15:30,554 --> 00:15:32,890
Well, maybe, like, babies,

364
00:15:32,973 --> 00:15:34,767
but that's weird,
because who likes babies?

365
00:15:35,017 --> 00:15:37,269
Mm, especially in the early years, I know.

366
00:15:37,353 --> 00:15:39,063
Well, this is a way to expose her.

367
00:15:39,146 --> 00:15:41,315
I mean, she'll be so rattled,
she'll call for a mistrial

368
00:15:41,398 --> 00:15:43,859
before you're even finished
with your opening statement.

369
00:15:44,193 --> 00:15:47,112
Oh, boy, now I'm really tempted.

370
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:49,990
Yeah. I ca-- I can't wait to see her face

371
00:15:50,074 --> 00:15:51,992
when she learns
that you're the one I'm with now.

372
00:15:52,076 --> 00:15:54,036
Believe me, I even wanted to lie

373
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:56,372
and tell her things had gotten sexual
with us, but...

374
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:58,123
I didn't want to make things weird.

375
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:01,627
You don't have to tell her about us.
I mean, I'm old enough to be your mother.

376
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:04,171
Right.
That's why I chose the word "weird."

377
00:16:05,422 --> 00:16:08,342
But maybe that's why I've been eager
to move in with you.

378
00:16:09,218 --> 00:16:11,845
And I think maybe it's time
for that to happen.

379
00:16:11,929 --> 00:16:14,515
[Dusty] Then I'm in.
I will be your lawyer.

380
00:16:15,015 --> 00:16:17,184
Let her see what I can do

381
00:16:17,267 --> 00:16:19,478
when I'm with a woman
who totally accepts me.

382
00:16:20,688 --> 00:16:23,607
I wouldn't change a thing, and of course,
you'll need to cut your hair.

383
00:16:23,691 --> 00:16:25,859
Oh, that'll make her totally crazy.

384
00:16:25,943 --> 00:16:27,861
Yeah. She could never get me to do that.

We're in a financial jam right now.

my show business connections

to get a film crew
to rent out the cottage

401
00:17:14,241 --> 00:17:15,993
for a couple of days.
You know, of course,

402

-the real payment there was--
-[Buster]

403
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:19,997
Uh, no, not at all. No. The--

404
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:22,374
And that was the real payment,
just to see her reaction

405
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:25,044
to a boom operator standing
on her bed, it was worth it.

406
00:17:25,127 --> 00:17:27,755

may-- maybe we can now afford,

that it's from <i>Fast and Furious.</i>

486
00:20:45,118 --> 00:20:47,120
It doesn't even work
unless you're in a Camaro.

487
00:20:47,204 --> 00:20:48,538
[Lucille]
Why are you worried about a joke?

488
00:20:48,622 --> 00:20:50,624
You just need an opening argument.

489
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:54,419
Well, because my argument comes
right after I state,

490
00:20:54,503 --> 00:20:56,505
"If you think that's funny,
wait until you hear

491
00:20:56,588 --> 00:20:58,882
what the opening statement
the prosecution is gonna give."

492
00:20:59,549 --> 00:21:02,844
I thought the prosecution went first
and then the defense.

493
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:05,264
Sorry, I forgot, you know everything.

494
00:21:05,347 --> 00:21:07,933
No, <i>I'm </i>sorry. I'm just anxious.

495
00:21:08,016 --> 00:21:09,768
<i>You're </i>anxious?! [scoffs]

496
00:21:10,227 --> 00:21:12,813
You're the mother of the defendant,
everybody's favorite.

497
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:15,274
I'm gonna be the one
everyone's staring at,

498
00:21:15,357 --> 00:21:17,985
and I know literally
who's gonna be judging me the most.

499
00:21:18,068 --> 00:21:20,445
-The judge can't show favoritism.
-No.

500
00:21:20,529 --> 00:21:22,948
-Lottie!
-[Lucille] Oh, that's ridiculous.

501
00:21:23,031 --> 00:21:26,285
Trust me, the moment
she sees you walk into that courtroom,

502
00:21:26,368 --> 00:21:27,703
the joke's going to be on <i>her!</i>

503
00:21:27,995 --> 00:21:30,247
Yeah! That's why I wanted
to tell the joke first!

504
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:33,125
God! You never listen to me!

505
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:35,794
What are you doing?
Nobody's even swimming out there!

506
00:21:36,461 --> 00:21:39,089
Okay, Dusty,
you really need to calm down.

507
00:21:39,172 --> 00:21:42,092
Ah. <i>You </i>calm down.
Stop telling me what to do.

508
00:21:42,175 --> 00:21:44,219
Well, I'm sorry.
I'm not trying to be your mother,

509
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:46,305
but-- but I'm worried about my son.

510
00:21:46,388 --> 00:21:48,140
Okay. If you don't want to be my mother,

511
00:21:48,223 --> 00:21:51,059
then maybe stop referring to me
as your son, how about that?

512
00:21:51,935 --> 00:21:53,979
I-- I'm talking about Buster.

513
00:21:55,063 --> 00:21:57,774
Yes!
You're always talking about Buster.

514
00:21:57,858 --> 00:22:00,652
Buster this, Buster that.
How are you gonna represent Buster?

515
00:22:00,736 --> 00:22:02,654
Have you talked to Buster today?
You know what?

516
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:04,531
[grunts]

517
00:22:05,615 --> 00:22:06,450
No!

518
00:22:07,617 --> 00:22:08,744
No, say it.

519
00:22:10,245 --> 00:22:11,371
I hate him!

520
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:12,789
I hope he loses!

521
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:16,460
I'm going to my fort! [sighs]

522
00:22:16,585 --> 00:22:18,628
[Ron]
<i>But even this could provide no solace</i>

523
00:22:18,712 --> 00:22:22,257
<i>-for Dusty. </i>
-Hey! Locals only, brosef.

524
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:24,426
<i>Turista non grata, </i>dude.

525
00:22:24,509 --> 00:22:26,678
Yo, dudes! It's me,

526
00:22:27,095 --> 00:22:29,264
-Dusty!
-What's with the tie?

527
00:22:29,723 --> 00:22:30,724
Yeah, I know.

528
00:22:30,807 --> 00:22:31,975
She made me wear it.

529
00:22:33,477 --> 00:22:35,228
[indistinct chatter]

530
00:22:37,481 --> 00:22:38,648
[man] Get lost!

531
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:43,904
-[sad piano music playing]
-That's right, keep walking, pal.

532
00:22:43,987 --> 00:22:45,989
[George Sr.] Jitters can be bad.
Remember when I had them

533
00:22:46,073 --> 00:22:47,908
the night before we went to trial

534
00:22:47,991 --> 00:22:50,952
-for that tax evasion in '88?
-[Lucille] Oh, yeah.

535
00:22:51,328 --> 00:22:53,997
-We had to hide all that boy fight money.
-[George Sr.] Yeah.

536
00:22:54,081 --> 00:22:56,583
You gave me
that "in case you're going away" present.

537
00:22:56,666 --> 00:22:58,460
That got the jitters out of me.

538
00:22:59,461 --> 00:23:01,421
What do you think about doing that
with Dusty?

539
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,842
How can you ask me that?

540
00:23:05,926 --> 00:23:08,053
I just know how you can be.
There was a time

541
00:23:08,136 --> 00:23:10,055
right after Gob was born...

542
00:23:10,972 --> 00:23:14,267
when you grew cold
and contemptuous of everyone.

543
00:23:14,726 --> 00:23:15,644
You remember that?

544
00:23:15,727 --> 00:23:17,979
Well, only because it's still going on.

545
00:23:18,313 --> 00:23:20,357
Maybe I've pulled away from him.

546
00:23:21,191 --> 00:23:24,236
In fact, most nights he goes back home
to sleep in his own bed.

547
00:23:24,403 --> 00:23:26,863
Which is fine.
I-- I want his head in his work.

548
00:23:27,197 --> 00:23:31,535
Huh. That doesn't necessarily mean
yours has to take the night off.

549
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,286
Hey, I hate the idea,

550
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:36,998
but we gotta do something to get
his confidence in that courtroom,

551
00:23:37,082 --> 00:23:40,127
and I am willing to shut my eyes
and let it happen.

552
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:44,464
Now you know how I felt all those years,
George.

553
00:23:47,676 --> 00:23:51,888
[Ron] <i>But even though Lucille felt good</i>
<i>about making George feel bad,</i>

554
00:23:51,972 --> 00:23:53,473
<i>she knew that he was right.</i>

555
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:57,144
<i>So that evening, she arrived at the home</i>

556
00:23:57,227 --> 00:23:59,479
<i>she felt Dusty had been driven back to</i>

557
00:23:59,563 --> 00:24:01,690
<i>by her lack of physical affection.</i>

558
00:24:01,773 --> 00:24:03,900
Someone will be with you
in just a moment.

559
00:24:04,317 --> 00:24:07,195
<i>Although it was considerably less modest</i>
<i>than she had imagined.</i>

560
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:09,281
[piano music playing]

561
00:24:11,408 --> 00:24:13,118
-May I help you?
-I'm sorry.

562
00:24:13,201 --> 00:24:15,412
I thought this was
where Dustin Radler lived.

563
00:24:15,495 --> 00:24:17,330
Mr. Radler's in his bedroom.

564
00:24:17,622 --> 00:24:19,458
-I'll have to announce you.
-Announce me?

565
00:24:19,541 --> 00:24:21,418
-Carla, please!
-No, no. I--

566
00:24:21,501 --> 00:24:23,587
I was just going to casually drop by.

567
00:24:23,837 --> 00:24:27,174
-Carla, Miss...
-Bluth. Lucille Bluth.

568
00:24:27,257 --> 00:24:29,426
Yeah, is here for a casual drop-by.

569
00:24:29,509 --> 00:24:31,553
Why is this the first
I'm hearing about it?

570
00:24:31,636 --> 00:24:33,680
I'm sorry. I didn't...
Was the casual drop-by

571
00:24:33,763 --> 00:24:34,890
scheduled within the month?

572
00:24:34,973 --> 00:24:37,058
You don't need to ask that.
Just check all the way back

573
00:24:37,142 --> 00:24:39,227
-through May.
-May I be of assistance?

574
00:24:39,311 --> 00:24:40,937
[woman] Mrs. Bluth is here for a CDB,

575
00:24:41,021 --> 00:24:42,606
and Carla didn't know about it.

576
00:24:42,689 --> 00:24:45,317
Most likely
because it wasn't made into a Vine.

577
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,318
[man] That's fine,

578
00:24:46,401 --> 00:24:48,695
I'm sure it was booked
through our second floor staff.

579
00:24:48,945 --> 00:24:51,448
I'm sorry, I didn't realize
you were close to the Salazars.

580
00:24:51,531 --> 00:24:52,824
No, I didn't book...

581
00:24:53,283 --> 00:24:55,577
-Who are the Salazars?
-[man] The second floor staff.

582
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:59,289
Mrs. Salazar was our pantry captain
for 15 years.

583
00:24:59,372 --> 00:25:01,875
[woman] Yes,
back when she was Ms. Bautista.

584
00:25:02,042 --> 00:25:04,711
Three guesses what she did
to get on two.

585
00:25:04,794 --> 00:25:07,255
[Lucille] No. You-- You...
I'm just here to see Dusty.

586
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:08,798
Uh, Mr. Radler.

587
00:25:08,882 --> 00:25:12,052
But, I-- I-- I'm sorry,
you all work for him?

588
00:25:12,135 --> 00:25:14,179
He never mentioned
that he had so much...

589
00:25:14,262 --> 00:25:16,765
[Ron]
<i>Lucille thought better of saying "money."</i>

590
00:25:16,848 --> 00:25:19,726
-...of a staff here.
-[man] On the first floor?

591
00:25:20,268 --> 00:25:22,604
What, does he now think
the Salazars control everything?

592
00:25:22,687 --> 00:25:25,690
I told you!
The first floor used to mean something

593
00:25:25,774 --> 00:25:26,691
in this house.

594
00:25:27,609 --> 00:25:29,402
Jean, no.

595
00:25:29,694 --> 00:25:31,029
That pantry is unguarded.

596
00:25:31,488 --> 00:25:35,408
You must start keeping up that datebook.
Jean!

597
00:25:36,076 --> 00:25:39,329
[Ron] <i>Lucille could tell there was tension</i>
<i>among her boyfriend's staff,</i>

598
00:25:39,412 --> 00:25:41,331
<i>and she felt compelled to say...</i>

599
00:25:41,414 --> 00:25:43,750
How rich is this sand hobo?

600
00:25:43,833 --> 00:25:45,585
[Ron] <i>Well, yeah, she did say that.</i>

601
00:25:45,669 --> 00:25:48,255
<i>But about the staff, she also said...</i>

602
00:25:48,338 --> 00:25:49,923
I'm going to [bleep] him.

603
00:25:50,006 --> 00:25:51,466
[Ron] <i>Oh, ap-</i>- <i>apologies.</i>

604
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:54,761
<i>I don't know why I thought</i>
<i>she said something about the staff.</i>

-Should we read the last one?
-[Maeby] No.

614

Because it's just gonna say <i>my </i>name.

I voted myself out, too, okay?
'Cause I can't take it anymore.

616

[Maeby]
So if these people really disappeared...
