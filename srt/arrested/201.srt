NOW THE STORY

2
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:04,212
OF A WEALTHY FAMILY 
WHO LOST EVERYTHING...

3
00:00:04,212 --> 00:00:05,630
AND THE ONE SON 
WHO HAD NO CHOICE...

4
00:00:05,630 --> 00:00:07,173
BUT TO KEEP THEM ALL TOGETHER.

5
00:00:12,678 --> 00:00:14,680
IT'S ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT.

6
00:00:19,185 --> 00:00:21,229
[narrator] 
THIS IS MICHAEL BLUTH.

7
00:00:21,229 --> 00:00:23,814
RIGHT NOW HE'S 
TAKING HIS SON, GEORGE MICHAEL,

8
00:00:23,814 --> 00:00:25,566
TO START A NEW LIFE IN ARIZONA.

9
00:00:25,566 --> 00:00:28,444
- PHOENIX, ARIZONA, HUH? 
THIS IS IT, BOY.

10
00:00:28,444 --> 00:00:30,530
WE ARE FREE.

11
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:32,698
WE'RE GONNA FOLLOW 
OUR DREAMS, YOU KNOW?

12
00:00:32,698 --> 00:00:34,159
AND THE BEST PART OF IT?

13
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:36,077
NOT WORKIN' 
FOR THE FAMILY ANYMORE.

14
00:00:36,077 --> 00:00:39,414
- YEAH, BUT DON'T-- DON'T YOU 
ALWAYS SAY "FAMILY FIRST"?

15
00:00:39,414 --> 00:00:40,706
- YES, I DO.

16
00:00:40,706 --> 00:00:44,210
BUT THAT IS 
NOT A FAMILY, OKAY?

17
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:46,296
THEY'RE A BUNCH 
OF GREEDY, SELFISH PEOPLE

18
00:00:46,296 --> 00:00:48,256
WHO HAVE OUR NOSE.

19
00:00:48,256 --> 00:00:50,966
AND AUNT LINDSAY. 
- SHE'S NOT MY REAL AUNT?

20
00:00:50,966 --> 00:00:52,843
- NOT A REAL NOSE.

21
00:00:52,843 --> 00:00:55,221
GOT A PICTURE OF HER WHEN 
SHE'S 14 IN A SWIMMING CAP.

22
00:00:55,221 --> 00:00:57,348
SHE LOOKS LIKE A FALCON.

23
00:00:57,348 --> 00:00:59,517
SPENT AN ENTIRE YEAR LIVING 
IN THAT STUPID MODEL HOME

24
00:00:59,517 --> 00:01:01,018
WITH THOSE PEOPLE,

25
00:01:01,018 --> 00:01:02,978
AND ALL THEY DID 
WAS LIE TO US.

26
00:01:02,978 --> 00:01:04,855
[narrator] 
THE MOST RECENT LIE WAS

27
00:01:04,855 --> 00:01:07,067
MICHAEL'S FATHER HAD HAD 
A HEART ATTACK WHILE IN PRISON.

28
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:09,944
- WE LOST HIM. 
[sobbing]

29
00:01:09,944 --> 00:01:11,529
[narrator] 
WHAT THE DOCTOR MEANT TO SAY

30
00:01:11,529 --> 00:01:13,448
WAS THAT GEORGE SR. HAD ESCAPED,

31
00:01:13,448 --> 00:01:15,325
A FEAT HE'D ACCOMPLISHED

32
00:01:15,325 --> 00:01:17,410
BY USING THE FAMILY'S PORTABLE 
STAIRWAY VEHICLE.

33
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:21,581
- I'D LOVE TO SEE THE LOOK 
ON THEIR FACES RIGHT NOW.

34
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:22,790
[chuckles]

35
00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:24,459
"WHERE'D HE GO?"

36
00:01:24,459 --> 00:01:26,336
- OR THEY-- THEY THINK WE'RE 
JUST HEADED HOME.

37
00:01:26,336 --> 00:01:28,588
ACTUALLY, YOU KNOW, 
THAT'S KIND OF WHAT I THOUGHT...

38
00:01:28,588 --> 00:01:30,923
UNTIL I HEARD ABOUT 
ALL THAT PHOENIX STUFF.

39
00:01:30,923 --> 00:01:32,842
[narrator] 
MICHAEL WAS CONCERNED THAT THE

40
00:01:32,842 --> 00:01:34,719
FULL IMPACT OF HIS DEPARTURE..

41
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:36,346
MIGHT HAVE BEEN LOST 
ON HIS FAMILY.

42
00:01:36,346 --> 00:01:38,055
[phone beeping]

43
00:01:38,055 --> 00:01:40,099
- HELLO. WHO IS THIS? 
- YES, THIS IS DR. BLUMEN.

44
00:01:40,099 --> 00:01:42,685
I'M CALLING 
REGARDING MICHAEL BLUTH.

45
00:01:42,685 --> 00:01:46,772
- MICHAEL! PHONE! 
[beeps]

46
00:01:46,772 --> 00:01:48,774
- THEY THINK 
WE'RE STILL THERE.

47
00:01:48,774 --> 00:01:51,152
WE'RE GOIN' BACK.

48
00:01:51,152 --> 00:01:54,239
[phone line beeping] 
HEY, MOM. ANY MESSAGES?

49
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:55,531
- NONE.

50
00:01:55,531 --> 00:01:57,117
[recorded voice, 
indistinct]

51
00:01:57,117 --> 00:01:58,909
- NO, THERE WAS A MESSAGE.

52
00:01:58,909 --> 00:02:00,953
IT WAS ABOUT MY HEALTH, 
BUT IT DOESN'T MATTER.

53
00:02:00,953 --> 00:02:02,913
MY SON AND I-- 
[horn blasts]

54
00:02:02,913 --> 00:02:05,583
- BUSTER, WHAT ARE YOU DOING 
WITH MOTHER'S RAPE HORN?

55
00:02:05,583 --> 00:02:08,211
YES, I HAVE A RAPE HORN, 
MICHAEL, BECAUSE YOU

56
00:02:08,211 --> 00:02:10,713
TOOK AWAY MY MACE.

57
00:02:10,713 --> 00:02:13,841
- YEAH, LIKE ANYONE 
WOULD WANT TO "R" HER.

58
00:02:13,841 --> 00:02:16,302
- THIS IS WHAT I'M TALKING 
ABOUT, MICHAEL.

59
00:02:16,302 --> 00:02:18,471
NOW THAT YOUR FATHER HAS 
DESERTED US, BUSTER'S BECOME

60
00:02:18,471 --> 00:02:20,723
IMPOSSIBLE TO CONTROL.

61
00:02:20,723 --> 00:02:22,517
SUDDENLY HE'S 
TOO MUCH OF A BIG SHOT

62
00:02:22,517 --> 00:02:23,768
TO BRUSH MOTHER'S HAIR.

63
00:02:23,768 --> 00:02:25,436
- WELL, I'M NOT HE--

64
00:02:28,231 --> 00:02:31,734
I'M NOT HELPING YOU 
WITH BUSTER ANYMORE.

65
00:02:31,734 --> 00:02:34,529
I'M NOT HELPING ANYONE 
WITH ANYTHING.

66
00:02:34,529 --> 00:02:37,490
I CAME HERE TO TELL YOU 
THAT MY SON AND I--

67
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:39,325
[blender whirring]

68
00:02:42,995 --> 00:02:44,830
[narrator] 
GEORGE MICHAEL, MEANWHILE, WAS

69
00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:46,291
APPROACHED BY HIS COUSIN MAEBY.

70
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:48,000
- SO, YOU'RE REALLY 
LEAVIN', HUH?

71
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,544
HAVE YOU TOLD 
YOUR GIRLFRIEND, BLAND?

72
00:02:49,544 --> 00:02:51,254
I MEAN, ANN.

73
00:02:51,254 --> 00:02:53,088
- SHE'S NOT MY GIRLFRIEND, 
AND SHE'S NOT BLAND.

74
00:02:53,088 --> 00:02:54,340
- REALLY?

75
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:56,050
BECAUSE, I MEAN, 
UNDER HER SCHOOL PICTURE

76
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:57,760
IT SAID "NOT PICTURED."

77
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,262
- OKAY, THEY PRINTED A 
RETRACTION

78
00:02:59,262 --> 00:03:01,096
IN THE SPRING SUPPLEMENT.

79
00:03:01,096 --> 00:03:03,224
AND, YEAH, SHE WAS REALLY 
LOOKIN' FORWARD TO SEEING ME

80
00:03:03,224 --> 00:03:04,600
IN MY UNCLE SAM OUTFIT...

81
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,311
IN THAT GET OUT THE VOTE 
ASSEMBLY TOMORROW.

82
00:03:06,311 --> 00:03:08,271
- WASN'T THAT SUPPOSED TO BE 
BEFORE THE ELECTION?

83
00:03:08,271 --> 00:03:10,606
- THEY HAD TO POSTPONE IT WHEN 
THAT FOREIGN EXCHANGE STUDENT

84
00:03:10,606 --> 00:03:11,774
PARKED TOO CLOSE TO THE GYM.

85
00:03:11,774 --> 00:03:13,108
- I DO IT. 
I PLAY UNCLE SAM.

86
00:03:13,108 --> 00:03:14,402
BETTER THAN PART I HAVE NOW--

87
00:03:14,402 --> 00:03:16,821
GUY WHO ORDERS STRIKE 
ON PEARL HARBOR.

88
00:03:16,821 --> 00:03:18,656
- I DON'T KNOW WHY 
YOU'RE NOT TAKING THIS

89
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:20,325
"I'M OUT OF HERE" SERIOUSLY,

90
00:03:20,325 --> 00:03:23,661
BUT I AM OUT OF HERE, 
SERIOUSLY.

91
00:03:23,661 --> 00:03:25,913
- LET'S FACE IT, MICHAEL. 
YOU'VE MADE THIS THREAT BEFORE.

92
00:03:27,122 --> 00:03:29,542
- TELL ME. WHEN?

93
00:03:29,542 --> 00:03:31,711
- THAT'S IT. 
I'M OUT OF HERE.

94
00:03:35,756 --> 00:03:36,882
TA-DA!

95
00:03:36,882 --> 00:03:38,551
I'M OUT OF HERE.

96
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:40,261
- [man on radio] 
WE GOT THE ATTACKING

97
00:03:40,261 --> 00:03:41,804
ANIMAL DOWN.

98
00:03:41,804 --> 00:03:44,181
- I'M OUT OF THIS FAMILY, 
SERIOUSLY.

99
00:03:44,181 --> 00:03:46,267
THIS TIME WE'RE GONNA BE 
SO FAR AWAY, YOU'LL NEVER

100
00:03:46,267 --> 00:03:48,185
BE ABLE TO FIND US.

101
00:03:48,185 --> 00:03:50,145
- WE'RE GOIN' TO PHOENIX. 
- DON'T TELL 'EM WHERE.

102
00:03:50,145 --> 00:03:52,147
- I-I JUST THOUGHT-- 
- IT DOESN'T MATTER WHY.

103
00:03:52,147 --> 00:03:54,692
- MICHAEL, MAYBE THE REASON 
WHY YOU ALWAYS COME BACK...

104
00:03:54,692 --> 00:03:56,652
IS BECAUSE YOU NEED US 
MORE THAN WE NEED YOU.

105
00:03:56,652 --> 00:03:58,863
- [scoffs] 
OH, THAT'S RICH.

106
00:03:58,863 --> 00:04:02,992
HUH. I NEED YOU. 
ALL RIGHT, I'LL TELL YOU WHAT.

107
00:04:02,992 --> 00:04:05,828
MOM, YOU'RE ALWAYS ASKING ME 
TO HELP YOU LOOK AFTER BUSTER.

108
00:04:05,828 --> 00:04:08,498
YOU CAN FIND SOMEBODY ELSE. 
I HOPE SHE DOESN'T KILL YOU.

109
00:04:08,498 --> 00:04:10,958
- I'LL KILL HER FIRST.

110
00:04:10,958 --> 00:04:12,543
- AND GOOD LUCK TRYING TO

111
00:04:12,543 --> 00:04:14,670
FIND SOMEONE ELSE TO RUN 
THE BUSINESS, BY THE WAY.

112
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:16,213
GOB, INSTEAD OF 
ALWAYS COMING TO ME

113
00:04:16,213 --> 00:04:17,715
ASKING ME FOR MONEY,

114
00:04:17,715 --> 00:04:19,425
SAYING, 
"I'VE MADE A HUGE MISTAKE,"

115
00:04:19,425 --> 00:04:22,637
YOU CAN BAIL YOURSELF OUT 
NEXT TIME.

116
00:04:22,637 --> 00:04:24,430
- I'VE NEVER ADMITTED 
TO A MISTAKE.

117
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:26,682
WHAT WOULD I 
HAVE MADE A MISTAKE ABOUT?

118
00:04:26,682 --> 00:04:28,893
- LINDSAY, INSTEAD OF SLEEPING 
IN TWIN BEDS, YOU AND YOUR

119
00:04:28,893 --> 00:04:31,103
HUSBAND TAKE THE MASTER BEDROOM.

120
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:32,730
IT'S NOT LIKE 
YOU'VE NEVER COME TO ME

121
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:34,315
WITH YOUR MARITAL PROBLEMS,

122
00:04:34,315 --> 00:04:35,775
SAYING, 
"OH, HELP ME, MICHAEL.

123
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:37,109
I THINK MY HUSBAND MIGHT BE A--"

00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:44,534
[narrator] 
AND SO, ONCE AGAIN,

129
00:04:44,534 --> 00:04:46,952
THE GUYS WERE ON THEIR WAY TO 
PHOENIX, NEVER TO LOOK BACK.

130
00:04:46,952 --> 00:04:48,579
- [low voice] 
IT'S JUST THE LAB CALLING.

131
00:04:48,579 --> 00:04:50,831
WE'LL GIVE HIM THE BAD NEWS 
IN PHOENIX.

132
00:04:50,831 --> 00:04:53,418
THEY KNOW WE'RE GONE. 
- GREAT.

133
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:57,338
YOU DID SAY PHOENIX AGAIN, 
BUT WHAT DO WE CARE?

134
00:04:57,338 --> 00:04:59,089
- SORRY.

135
00:04:59,089 --> 00:05:01,842
- NOW, DO YOU WANT TO STEER, 
OR ARE YOU TOO OLD TO SIT

136
00:05:01,842 --> 00:05:03,511
ON YOUR POP'S LAP AND DRIVE?

137
00:05:07,765 --> 00:05:09,850
- I THINK I MIGHT BE.

138
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:11,811
- OKAY.

139
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:15,606
[siren winding down]

140
00:05:21,779 --> 00:05:23,448
- CAR'S REGISTERED 
TO GEORGE BLUTH,

141
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:25,825
SO WE HAD TO CHECK.

142
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:27,535
BUT HE'S BEEN CAUGHT, 
SO YOU'RE FREE TO GO.

143
00:05:27,535 --> 00:05:29,495
- HE'S BEEN CAUGHT?

144
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:31,163
[narrator] 
MICHAEL KNEW IF HE WENT BACK

145
00:05:31,163 --> 00:05:32,748
TO SEE HIS FATHER,

146
00:05:32,748 --> 00:05:34,625
HE WOULD ONLY END UP 
SAYING SOMETHING HURTFUL.

147
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:36,752
- WE'RE GOIN' BACK.

148
00:05:36,752 --> 00:05:39,046
[narrator] 
IN FACT, THE POLICE ONLY THOUGHT

149
00:05:39,046 --> 00:05:40,631
THEY'D ARRESTED GEORGE SR.

150
00:05:40,631 --> 00:05:43,008
- DO YOU HAVE ANY COOKIES 
WITH NO PRESERVATIVES?

00:05:47,388 --> 00:05:48,889
- YEAH!

155
00:05:48,889 --> 00:05:51,434

IT'S OSCAR.

156
00:05:51,434 --> 00:05:54,019

LUCILLE HAD A RELATIONSHIP

158
00:05:55,938 --> 00:05:58,023
WITH OSCAR YEARS EARLIER,

159
00:05:58,023 --> 00:05:59,692
WHICH SHE WAS NOT EAGER 
TO REKINDLE.

160
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:00,860
- WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?

161
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:02,570
THE BOY IS HERE. 
- OH.

162
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:06,616
THEY SAID MY FATHER WAS HERE. 
- DID THEY?

163
00:06:08,909 --> 00:06:11,954
- LET'S GET OUT OF HERE. 
- WHAT-WHAT ABOUT OSCAR?

164
00:06:11,954 --> 00:06:14,457
- YES. THEY IMPOUNDED MY, UH-- 
MY HUMBLE TRAILER.

165
00:06:14,457 --> 00:06:16,501
- YOU'LL STAY WITH US. 
- NO, HE WON'T.

166
00:06:16,501 --> 00:06:18,753
- YOU'RE THE ONE WHO SAYS 
I NEED A FATHER FIGURE.

167
00:06:18,753 --> 00:06:22,131
- YES. 
A FATHER FIGURE.

168
00:06:24,133 --> 00:06:26,969
- FINE. BUT YOU'RE NOT 
SLEEPING IN MY BED.

169
00:06:26,969 --> 00:06:29,430
- OKAY. 
- OKAY. YEAH.

170
00:06:30,765 --> 00:06:32,349
[narrator] 
SOON, MICHAEL ARRIVED

171
00:06:32,349 --> 00:06:34,226
TO CLAIM HIS FATHER...

172
00:06:34,226 --> 00:06:36,395
AND WAS MET BY THE FAMILY 
ATTORNEY, BARRY ZUCKERKORN.

173
00:06:36,395 --> 00:06:37,563
- HMM.

174
00:06:37,563 --> 00:06:39,064
- NO, I KNOW, 
I KNOW, I KNOW.

175
00:06:39,064 --> 00:06:41,609
EVERYBODY SAYS LEAVE IT ALONE, 
LEAVE IT ALONE.

176
00:06:41,609 --> 00:06:42,943
DOES THIS LOOK CONTAGIOUS 
TO YOU?

177
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:44,319
HEY, KIDDO.

178
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:46,906
ALL RIGHT. 
IT WASN'T YOUR FATHER.

179
00:06:46,906 --> 00:06:48,282
IT WAS YOUR UNCLE.

180
00:06:48,282 --> 00:06:49,867
I RAN INTO THEM 
AS THEY WERE LEAVING.

181
00:06:49,867 --> 00:06:52,077
- THERE HE IS! 
- GOT YA!

182
00:06:52,077 --> 00:06:55,330
- OH, FOR GOD'S SAKE. 
- [grunts] YEAH!

183
00:06:55,330 --> 00:06:57,374
- I ONLY CAME BACK TO TELL HIM 
I WAS LEAVING, SO I GUESS

184
00:06:57,374 --> 00:06:59,043
IT'S TIME TO GO, SON.

185
00:06:59,043 --> 00:07:01,587
- WHERE YOU GOING? 
- WE CAN'T TELL YOU.

186
00:07:01,587 --> 00:07:04,339
- NO, NO. WE CAN TELL BARRY. 
WE'RE GOING TO PHOENIX.

187
00:07:04,339 --> 00:07:06,676
- OH, I WISH YOU 
HADN'T HAVE SAID THAT.

188
00:07:06,676 --> 00:07:08,135
AS YOUR LAWYER, 
I HAVE TO INFORM YOU

189
00:07:08,135 --> 00:07:09,637
YOU CANNOT LEAVE THE STATE.

190
00:07:09,637 --> 00:07:11,431
WITH YOUR FATHER GONE, 
THEY WANT TO HOLD YOU.

191
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:13,015
- M-ME?

192
00:07:13,015 --> 00:07:14,600
- THEY'RE GOING TO 
INDICT YOU TOMORROW.

193
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,393
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO 
IS COME UP WITH THE BAIL.

194
00:07:16,393 --> 00:07:18,103
TAKE IT OUT OF THE BUSINESS.

195
00:07:18,103 --> 00:07:19,939
- BUT I-- I CAN'T. 
I QUIT.

196
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:22,107
I DON'T WANT TO FOLLOW 
IN MY FATHER'S FOOTSTEPS.

197
00:07:22,107 --> 00:07:24,485
- THEN YOU MIGHT WIND UP 
ON HIS COT.

198
00:07:24,485 --> 00:07:27,697
OH, MAN, I WISH YOU 
HADN'T SAID PHOENIX.

199
00:07:27,697 --> 00:07:29,574
WOW.

200
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:34,620
[narrator] 
MICHAEL HAD JUST FOUND OUT

201
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:35,871
HE COULDN'T LEAVE THE STATE...

202
00:07:35,871 --> 00:07:37,457
UNLESS HE CAME UP WITH BAIL.

203
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:39,124
- OKAY, LISTEN. 
I'M GONNA GET

204
00:07:39,124 --> 00:07:41,085
THE COMPANY CHECKBOOK 
AND DON'T TELL THE FAMILY.

205
00:07:41,085 --> 00:07:43,128
WE CAN'T GIVE THEM 
THE SATISFACTION OF TELLING THEM

206
00:07:43,128 --> 00:07:44,589
THAT I NEED MONEY, OKAY?

207
00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:46,716
DO YOU REMEMBER WHAT WE 
SAY ABOUT THE FAMILY?

208
00:07:46,716 --> 00:07:48,342
- IT'S NOT AUNT LINDSAY'S NOSE.

209
00:07:48,342 --> 00:07:50,052
- YES, BUT NO.

210
00:07:50,052 --> 00:07:51,971
DON'T-- DON'T TELL THEM 
THAT WE WERE GOIN' TO--

211
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:53,598
- WE SAY WE DON'T 
NEED THEM. HMM?

212
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:55,057
- OH. YEAH. OKAY.

213
00:07:55,057 --> 00:07:57,602
THE NEW ONE. 
I DIDN'T--

214
00:07:57,602 --> 00:07:58,978
[tv: woman] 
IT COMES FROM KNOWING

215
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:00,646
YOU'RE TONED AND FIT.

216
00:08:00,646 --> 00:08:02,690
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING? 
- I'M EXERCISING, MICHAEL.

217
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:04,859
I SEE YOU FOUND AN EXERCISE 
TAPE MADE FOR PEOPLE

218
00:08:04,859 --> 00:08:06,569
AS LAZY AS YOU ARE.

219
00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:09,279
- I DO HAVE A LOVE LIFE. 
- TIGHTEN, ONE, TWO, THREE.

220
00:08:09,279 --> 00:08:11,323
- OKAY, THIS IS GOING OFF.

221
00:08:11,323 --> 00:08:13,033
ONE NIGHT IN THE MASTER BEDROOM,

222
00:08:13,033 --> 00:08:15,495
AND YOU GOT YOURSELF 
A LOVE LIFE AGAIN?

223
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:17,788
- WELL, I'LL BE HONEST. 
AT FIRST, IT WAS AWKWARD.

224
00:08:17,788 --> 00:08:21,667
[tv: woman] 
TOGETHER, TWO, THREE, FOUR.

225
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:24,336
RELEASE, TWO, THREE, FOUR. 
- OH, LINDSAY.

226
00:08:24,336 --> 00:08:25,880
[tv off]

227
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:29,174
UH, WELL, 
THIS IS EXCITING.

228
00:08:29,174 --> 00:08:30,760
- FINALLY WE CAN BE 
A NORMAL COUPLE.

229
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,011
- NICE TO BE BACK IN A QUEEN.

230
00:08:34,304 --> 00:08:36,807
IT'S TOO MUCH PRESSURE. 
- I CAN'T DO THIS.

231
00:08:36,807 --> 00:08:38,518
[narrator] 
SO LINDSAY AND TOBIAS

232
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:40,728
FINALLY TOOK A HARD 
LOOK AT THEIR RELATIONSHIP.

233
00:08:40,728 --> 00:08:42,479
- YOU KNOW, LINDSAY,

234
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:44,857
AS A THERAPIST, I HAVE ADVISED 
A NUMBER OF COUPLES...

235
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:47,527
TO EXPLORE 
AN OPEN RELATIONSHIP...

236
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:50,655
WHERE-WHERE THE COUPLE REMAINS 
EMOTIONALLY COMMITTED,

237
00:08:50,655 --> 00:08:54,491
BUT FREE TO EXPLORE 
EXTRAMARITAL ENCOUNTERS.

238
00:08:54,491 --> 00:08:55,785
- DID IT WORK 
FOR THOSE PEOPLE?

239
00:08:55,785 --> 00:08:58,203
- NO. IT NEVER DOES.

240
00:08:58,203 --> 00:09:00,915
THESE PEOPLE SOMEHOW 
DELUDE THEMSELVES INTO

241
00:09:00,915 --> 00:09:02,124
THINKING IT MIGHT, BUT--

242
00:09:03,751 --> 00:09:06,796
BUT IT MIGHT 
WORK FOR US.

243
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:08,548
- WELL, WE COULD GIVE IT A SHOT.

244
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:10,507
- GREAT. WE'LL HAMMER OUT 
THE DETAILS LATER.

245
00:09:10,507 --> 00:09:13,343
RIGHT NOW WE'VE GOT 
A DAUGHTER TO TELL.

246
00:09:13,343 --> 00:09:15,470
MAEBY, WE'RE HAVING 
A FAMILY MEETING!

247
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:16,931
[narrator] 
ON HER WAY

248
00:09:16,931 --> 00:09:18,641
TO THE FAMILY MEETING, 
- FAMILY MEETING!

249
00:09:18,641 --> 00:09:19,850
[narrator] 
LINDSAY HAD

250
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:21,101
AN UNEXPECTED ENCOUNTER.

251
00:09:21,101 --> 00:09:22,311
- HELLO.

252
00:09:22,311 --> 00:09:23,771
- OH, HI. 
GOB TOLD ME TO COME BY.

253
00:09:23,771 --> 00:09:25,355
- WELL, UH, 
I DON'T THINK HE'S HERE.

254
00:09:25,355 --> 00:09:29,484
- WELL, TELL HIM 
I LIKE WHAT I SEE.

255
00:09:29,484 --> 00:09:31,403
- AND WE PROBABLY WON'T 
EVEN ACT ON IT.

256
00:09:31,403 --> 00:09:33,530
WE'RE NOT 
GONNA GET A DIVORCE.

257
00:09:33,530 --> 00:09:35,324
IF ANYTHING, 
IT'LL BRING MOMMY AND DADDY

258
00:09:35,324 --> 00:09:36,617
CLOSER TOGETHER.

259
00:09:36,617 --> 00:09:38,285
- I MET SOMEONE. 
I'VE GOT A DATE.

260
00:09:38,285 --> 00:09:41,330
I'M DATING SOMEONE.

261
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:47,169
- WELL, LET THE GREAT 
EXPERIMENT BEGIN!

262
00:09:47,169 --> 00:09:49,213
- YOU'RE NOT USING 
MY MASTER BEDROOM FOR THAT.

263
00:09:49,213 --> 00:09:50,923
- I BELIEVE YOU LEFT.

264
00:09:50,923 --> 00:09:53,175
OR DID YOU REALIZE HOW MUCH 
YOU NEED US AFTER ALL?

265
00:09:53,175 --> 00:09:55,135
- ACTUALLY, I CAME BACK 
BECAUSE I NEED SOMETHING.

266
00:09:55,135 --> 00:09:56,511
- HMM.

267
00:09:56,511 --> 00:09:58,222
- SOME THINGS.

268
00:09:58,222 --> 00:10:00,474
LIKE THE CHECKBOOK. 
WHERE'S THE CORPORATE CHECKBOOK?

269
00:10:00,474 --> 00:10:03,018
- GOB MUST'VE TAKEN IT 
TO THE OFFICE.

270
00:10:03,018 --> 00:10:04,812
MOM PUT HIM IN CHARGE.

271
00:10:04,812 --> 00:10:06,856
THAT'S RIGHT, MICHAEL. 
HE'S GOT YOUR OLD JOB.

272
00:10:06,856 --> 00:10:08,440
- WELL, I BETTER GET OVER THERE

273
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:10,567
BEFORE HE BRINGS THE WHOLE 
COMPANY DOWN.

274
00:10:10,567 --> 00:10:11,902
- IT'S ONLY BEEN THREE HOURS.

275
00:10:11,902 --> 00:10:13,403
HOW MUCH DAMAGE 
COULD HE REALLY DO?

276
00:10:13,403 --> 00:10:15,197
AND RELEASE.

277
00:10:15,197 --> 00:10:17,407
[narrator] 
IN THREE HOURS, GOB HAD

278
00:10:17,407 --> 00:10:20,160
DONE $45,000 IN DAMAGE.

279
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,121
- IN THERE, PLEASE.

280
00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:26,709
- HEY, WHERE'S MY DESK?

281
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:28,585
- OH, I THINK 
IT'S THE MASSAGE TABLE

282
00:10:28,585 --> 00:10:30,796
IN THE BREAK ROOM NOW.

283
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:32,673
TAKE THE WINDOW. 
- NO, HOLD IT.

284
00:10:32,673 --> 00:10:35,092
GOB, MOM MAY THINK 
THAT SHE'S GIVEN YOU MY JOB,

285
00:10:35,092 --> 00:10:37,386
BUT THE BOARD STILL HAS TO 
APPROVE THAT DECISION.

286
00:10:37,386 --> 00:10:40,765
- ACTUALLY, THEY ALREADY HAVE. 
- WHY SHOULD WE BELIEVE IN YOU?

287
00:10:40,765 --> 00:10:42,557
- FOR THE SAME REASON 
YOU SHOULD BELIEVE THAT

288
00:10:42,557 --> 00:10:43,768
A HUNDRED-DOLLAR BILL...

289
00:10:43,768 --> 00:10:47,146
IS NO MORE 
THAN A HUNDRED PENNIES.

290
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:50,274
[gasping]

291
00:10:50,274 --> 00:10:51,942
THEY APPROVED ME UNANIMOUSLY.

292
00:10:51,942 --> 00:10:53,485
- WHY WOULDN'T THEY?

293
00:10:53,485 --> 00:10:55,237
YOU'VE ONLY LOST THEM 
$99 SO FAR.

294
00:10:55,237 --> 00:10:57,156
- I'VE ALREADY BEEN 
PRETTY SUCCESSFUL.

295
00:10:57,156 --> 00:10:58,532
SHOWING THE MODEL HOUSE AGAIN.

296
00:10:58,532 --> 00:11:00,200
SENT A REALTOR OVER THERE 
YESTERDAY.

297
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,744
[narrator] 
IT WAS THIS REALTOR

298
00:11:01,744 --> 00:11:03,453
WHO'D RUN INTO LINDSAY, 
THINKING SHE WAS

299
00:11:03,453 --> 00:11:04,872
LOOKING FOR A HOME.

300
00:11:04,872 --> 00:11:06,498
- I HAVE AN OPEN THING 
GOIN' ON TOO.

301
00:11:06,498 --> 00:11:08,333
I'LL GIVE YOU THE ADDRESS, 
AND YOU CAN COME BY.

302
00:11:08,333 --> 00:11:11,336
AND I THINK YOU'LL REALLY 
LIKE THE NEIGHBORS.

303
00:11:11,336 --> 00:11:13,255
- OKAY.

304
00:11:13,255 --> 00:11:14,757
- SO WHAT BRINGS YOU HERE, 
MICHAEL?

305
00:11:14,757 --> 00:11:16,508
I HOPE IT'S NOT 
FOR A HANDOUT.

306
00:11:16,508 --> 00:11:18,969
I RUN A PRETTY TIGHT SHIP 
AROUND HERE.

307
00:11:18,969 --> 00:11:21,764
- WITH A POOL TABLE? 
- IT'S A GAMING SHIP.

308
00:11:21,764 --> 00:11:25,392
- I'M HERE BECAUSE 
I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT NEED ME.

309
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:28,979
- I NEED YOU? 
- THAT'S RIGHT.

310
00:11:28,979 --> 00:11:31,606
- OH, BOY, THAT'S GOOD.

311
00:11:31,606 --> 00:11:35,527
CAN'T WAIT TO CALL THE GUYS 
IN TO HEAR THIS ONE.

312
00:11:35,527 --> 00:11:37,654
LISTEN-- HOW DO YOU 
INTERCOM ON THIS?

313
00:11:37,654 --> 00:11:38,739
- STAR TWO.

314
00:11:38,739 --> 00:11:40,657
- YEAH. 
AT THE SAME TIME?

315
00:11:40,657 --> 00:11:42,326
- YEAH, JUST-- 
NO, THE STAR IN THE CORNER.

316
00:11:42,326 --> 00:11:43,368
THE STAR.

317
00:11:43,368 --> 00:11:44,787
- SO IF I DO IT LIKE THAT--

318
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:46,496
- NO, TURN IT AROUND 
THE OTHER WAY. STAR.

319
00:11:46,496 --> 00:11:47,873
- OH, THAT STAR.

320
00:11:47,873 --> 00:11:49,666
- LET'S JUST HANG IT UP. 
THERE WE GO.

321
00:11:49,666 --> 00:11:52,127
I-I THOUGHT THAT YOU MIGHT NEED 
ME TO HELP YOU WITH THE BOOKS.

322
00:11:52,127 --> 00:11:54,004
YOU KNOW, 
THE CORPORATE CHECKBOOK.

323
00:11:54,004 --> 00:11:55,380
WHERE IS IT?

324
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:56,757
- ACTUALLY, MOM'S GOT IT.

325
00:11:56,757 --> 00:11:58,550
SHE WASN'T COMFORTABLE 
WITH ME--

326
00:11:58,550 --> 00:11:59,885
[narrator] 
MICHAEL NOW HAD

327
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:01,636
THE DISTASTEFUL CHOICE...

328
00:12:01,636 --> 00:12:03,764
OF EITHER ASKING HIS MOTHER 
FOR MONEY OR GOING TO JAIL.

329
00:12:03,764 --> 00:12:05,724
- MAYBE BUSTER 
KILLED HER ALREADY.

330
00:12:05,724 --> 00:12:06,892
[narrator] 
TOBIAS WAS ALSO

331
00:12:06,892 --> 00:12:09,144
HAVING A BAD DAY.

332
00:12:09,144 --> 00:12:11,814
LINDSAY HAD MET SOMEONE, 
AND HE HADN'T.

333
00:12:11,814 --> 00:12:13,816
AND THAT'S WHEN HE FOUND WHAT

334
00:12:13,816 --> 00:12:16,068
HE THOUGHT WAS A SUPPORT GROUP 
FOR DEPRESSED MEN.

335
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:22,449
- WELL, IF IT ISN'T THE BOY 
WHO CRIED "PHOENIX."

336
00:12:22,449 --> 00:12:26,536
- OHH! NO, I WAS JUST, UH-- 
JUST WORRIED ABOUT BUSTER.

337
00:12:26,536 --> 00:12:29,790
I THOUGHT MAYBE I SHOULD 
GIVE HIM A LITTLE GUIDANCE.

338
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:31,666
WRITE HIM A CHECK.

339
00:12:31,666 --> 00:12:33,752
BE A ROLE MODEL. 
WHERE'S THE COMPANY CHECKBOOK?

340
00:12:33,752 --> 00:12:35,587
- I ALREADY HAVE A NEW 
ROLE MODEL, MICHAEL.

341
00:12:35,587 --> 00:12:37,506
- HIS UNCLE OSCAR 
IS LIVING HERE NOW.

342
00:12:37,506 --> 00:12:39,758
- WOW.

343
00:12:39,758 --> 00:12:43,095
YOU GUYS HAVE ACCOMPLISHED A LOT 
IN THE LAST THREE HOURS.

344
00:12:43,095 --> 00:12:44,805
WHERE IS HE?

345
00:12:44,805 --> 00:12:46,306
- I SENT HIM OUT 
FOR A NEW AIR HORN.

346
00:12:46,306 --> 00:12:49,393
[bell dings] 
[men grunting]

347
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:53,981
[ horn blasts ] 
- YEAH!

348
00:12:53,981 --> 00:12:56,233
- WE'VE GOT IT ALL 
UNDER CONTROL.

349
00:12:56,233 --> 00:12:57,401
- GREAT.

350
00:12:59,444 --> 00:13:01,030
I'M JUST WORRIED 
THAT IT'S ONLY GONNA BE

351
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:02,614
A MATTER OF TIME...

352
00:13:02,614 --> 00:13:04,825
BEFORE THE MEDIA STARTS 
PUTTING TOGETHER ALL THE PIECES

353
00:13:04,825 --> 00:13:06,869
OF THIS IRAQ STORY.

354
00:13:06,869 --> 00:13:08,745
[narrator] 
MICHAEL HAD RECENTLY FOUND OUT

355
00:13:08,745 --> 00:13:10,247
THAT THE MODEL HOME...

356
00:13:10,247 --> 00:13:12,166
HE AND HIS SON 
CURRENTLY LIVED IN...

357
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:14,334
WAS VERY SIMILAR TO SOME 
HIS FATHER MAY HAVE ILLEGALLY

358
00:13:14,334 --> 00:13:16,628
BEEN BUILDING IN IRAQ.

359
00:13:16,628 --> 00:13:18,463
- THEY HAVEN'T YET.

360
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:21,091
AND FRANKLY, IT'S A VERY 
DIFFICULT CHARGE TO PROVE.

361
00:13:26,763 --> 00:13:29,975
- MAN, THAT JURY'S GONNA 
FALL IN LOVE WITH YOU.

362
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:31,726
- WHAT DO YOU NEED, 
MICHAEL?

363
00:13:31,726 --> 00:13:34,604
- I DON'T NEED ANYTHING.

364
00:13:34,604 --> 00:13:37,691
I'M GREAT, 'CAUSE 
EVERYONE ELSE IS GREAT.

365
00:13:37,691 --> 00:13:39,401
I CAN'T TELL YOU 
HOW NICE IT IS

366
00:13:39,401 --> 00:13:41,778
TO NOT BE NEEDED ANYMORE.

367
00:13:41,778 --> 00:13:44,406
- I WANT YOU.

368
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:51,121
- OKAY, THE JURY MIGHT 
ACTUALLY LIKE THAT.

369
00:13:51,121 --> 00:13:52,622
[narrator] 
IT WAS AT THAT MOMENT

370
00:13:52,622 --> 00:13:55,250
THAT GOB FOUND SOMETHING 
THE JURY MIGHT NOT LIKE.

371
00:13:56,293 --> 00:13:58,587
- HAMMER. 
OOPS.

372
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:09,723
[narrator] 
AND LINDSAY ARRIVED AT WHAT

373
00:14:09,723 --> 00:14:10,975
SHE THOUGHT WAS A DATE.

374
00:14:10,975 --> 00:14:12,935
- HEY! 
YOU FOUND IT.

375
00:14:12,935 --> 00:14:15,604
SO, SHALL WE START 
IN THE KITCHEN?

376
00:14:15,604 --> 00:14:18,398
- I THOUGHT THE BEDROOM. 
- SURE.

377
00:14:18,398 --> 00:14:19,942
I'LL MEET YOU UP THERE.

378
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:22,236
I GOTTA MAKE THIS PLACE 
SMELL LIKE COOKIES.

379
00:14:22,236 --> 00:14:23,570
AND YOU SHOULD KNOW,

380
00:14:23,570 --> 00:14:25,948
I AM ANTICIPATING 
MULTIPLES ON THIS.

381
00:14:25,948 --> 00:14:28,325
- WELL, I WOULDN'T BE 
DOING THIS IF I DIDN'T THINK

382
00:14:28,325 --> 00:14:29,659
THAT WAS A POSSIBILITY.

383
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:35,665
[narrator] 
LINDSAY WAS NERVOUS

384
00:14:35,665 --> 00:14:37,542
AND TOOK A SHOWER TO RELAX.

385
00:14:37,542 --> 00:14:40,045
- I CAN'T DO THIS. 
I'M NOT READY FOR THIS.

386
00:14:40,045 --> 00:14:42,172
[screams]

387
00:14:42,172 --> 00:14:43,798
- COME ON, KIDS.

388
00:14:43,798 --> 00:14:45,842
WE'LL GO DOWNSTAIRS 
AND HAVE SOME COOKIES.

389
00:14:45,842 --> 00:14:47,052
[narrator] 
THE KIDS WERE IN

390
00:14:47,052 --> 00:14:49,388
FOR SOME BAD NEWS TOO.

391
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:51,473
TOBIAS, MEANWHILE, 
DISCOVERED THAT WHAT HE THOUGT

392
00:14:51,473 --> 00:14:53,100
WAS A SUPPORT GROUP...

393
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,935
TURNED OUT TO BE A TEAM 
OF BALD MEN PAINTED BLUE.

394
00:14:56,561 --> 00:14:59,023
EVEN LUCILLE WAS ABOUT 
TO FIND HERSELF IN TROUBLE.

395
00:14:59,023 --> 00:15:00,274
- OH, YOU'VE DONE THIS 
BEFORE.

396
00:15:00,274 --> 00:15:01,816
- [chuckling]

397
00:15:01,816 --> 00:15:03,735
- YOU KNOW, YOU SHOULD LET 
YOUR HAIR GROW LONG.

398
00:15:03,735 --> 00:15:07,031
- YEAH? I'VE THOUGHT ABOUT IT. 
I GUESS I'D LOOK LIKE YOU.

399
00:15:07,031 --> 00:15:10,159
[chuckling] 
- MORE THAN YOU'LL EVER KNOW.

400
00:15:12,953 --> 00:15:15,372
- ARE YOU LIVING IN ONE 
OF SADDAM'S MANY PALACES?

401
00:15:15,372 --> 00:15:17,958
THEY MAY HAVE BEEN BUILT 
BY THE SAME DEVELOPER.

402
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:19,668
AND A SEAL ATTACK.

403
00:15:19,668 --> 00:15:22,046
MEET ONE SURPRISED BATHER, 
COMING UP.

404
00:15:23,338 --> 00:15:25,632
- [giggling]

405
00:15:25,632 --> 00:15:27,717
[narrator] 
SEVEN MINUTES HAD PASSED SINCE

406
00:15:27,717 --> 00:15:29,428
GOB HAD DISCOVERED THE DOCUMENT.

407
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:32,889
[intercom: woman] 
GOB, YOUR MOTHER ON LINE ONE.

408
00:15:32,889 --> 00:15:35,767
- I'M COMING OVER. 
DON'T TALK TO ANYONE.

409
00:15:35,767 --> 00:15:37,519
[narrator] 
IT WAS AT THAT MOMENT

410
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:40,064
THAT LUCILLE WAS STOPPED 
BY A DOCUMENTARY FILMMAKER.

411
00:15:40,064 --> 00:15:42,232
- UH, YOUR COMPANY'S BEING 
ACCUSED OF PROFITING OFF

412
00:15:42,232 --> 00:15:43,900
THE BUILDING OF HOUSES IN IRAQ.

413
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:46,111
- THAT'S CRAZY. 
WE'RE ALL LOYAL AMERICANS.

414
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:48,572
- OH, YEAH.

415
00:15:48,572 --> 00:15:52,409
WOULD YOU ENLIST YOUR SON 
OR DAUGHTER IN THE ARMY?

416
00:15:52,409 --> 00:15:54,869
- YES.

417
00:15:57,497 --> 00:16:01,085
[narrator] 
MICHAEL WAS OUT OF OPTIONS...

418
00:16:01,085 --> 00:16:04,004
AND, KNOWING THAT HIS FATHER 
HAD A PENCHANT FOR HIDING

419
00:16:04,004 --> 00:16:05,589
VALUABLE THINGS IN WALLS,

420
00:16:05,589 --> 00:16:08,842
CONSIDERED ONE LAST 
DESPERATE GAMBIT.

421
00:16:08,842 --> 00:16:10,510
- THIS IS CRAZY.

422
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:12,762
WHAT AM I DOING? 
USING A HAMMER TO TRY TO--

423
00:16:12,762 --> 00:16:15,890
- [yells] 
- [screams]

424
00:16:17,642 --> 00:16:20,354
ARE YOU CRAZY? 
- ARE YOU BLUE?

425
00:16:20,354 --> 00:16:23,815
- ONLY IN COLOR, MICHAEL. 
ONLY IN COLOR.

426
00:16:23,815 --> 00:16:25,442
IT SEEMS I MIGHT 
HAVE STUMBLED UPON

427
00:16:25,442 --> 00:16:26,776
AN ACTING OPPORTUNITY.

428
00:16:26,776 --> 00:16:28,903
- AS A MEMBER 
OF THE BLUE MAN GROUP?

429
00:16:28,903 --> 00:16:31,115
- OH, NO, YOU'RE THINKING 
OF THE SUPPORT GROUP.

430
00:16:31,115 --> 00:16:32,616
I MADE THAT 
SAME MISTAKE MYSELF.

431
00:16:32,616 --> 00:16:34,368
THEY'RE CALLED 
THE BLUE MAN GROUP.

432
00:16:34,368 --> 00:16:35,910
BUT IT'S FUNNY.

433
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:38,413
IF I HADN'T 
SOUGHT OUT A SUPPORT GROUP,

434
00:16:38,413 --> 00:16:41,000
I NEVER WOULD'VE GOTTEN 
THIS GIG AS AN UNDERSTUDY

435
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,709
FOR A PERFORMANCE ART GROUP.

436
00:16:42,709 --> 00:16:44,836
[clatter on floor]

437
00:16:44,836 --> 00:16:47,547
YOU KNOW, THE UNIVERSE WORKS 
IN MYSTERIOUS WAYS, MICHAEL.

438
00:16:47,547 --> 00:16:50,217
YOU NEVER KNOW WHERE HELP 
IS GOING TO COME FROM

439
00:16:50,217 --> 00:16:52,094
UNTIL YOU LOOK FOR IT.

440
00:16:52,094 --> 00:16:55,264
- WHY DOES EVERYBODY THINK 
THAT I NEED HELP?

441
00:16:55,264 --> 00:16:58,350
- [chuckles] 
MICHAEL, LOOK AT YOU.

442
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:00,935
I MEAN, YOU'RE HOLDING 
A SLEDGEHAMMER, YOUR SHIRT

443
00:17:00,935 --> 00:17:02,729
IS COV-- OH, I DID THAT.

444
00:17:02,729 --> 00:17:06,275
UM, HERE, LET ME, UH-- 
WELL--

445
00:17:06,275 --> 00:17:08,027
[narrator] 
AND MICHAEL REALIZED THAT

446
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:09,444
HE, TOO, HAD BEEN TOO PROUD.

447
00:17:09,444 --> 00:17:11,905
- I NEED MONEY. 
- I CAN'T HELP YOU.

448
00:17:11,905 --> 00:17:13,615
- I KNOW.

449
00:17:13,615 --> 00:17:16,576
IT DID BOTHER ME THAT THEY 
DID SO WELL WITHOUT ME.

450
00:17:16,576 --> 00:17:18,953
BUT I-I DO HAVE TO 
ASK THEM FOR HELP.

451
00:17:18,953 --> 00:17:21,331
- AND I HAVE TO ASK 
FOR AN AUDITION.

452
00:17:21,331 --> 00:17:23,792
- YOU HAVEN'T 
AUDITIONED YET?

453
00:17:23,792 --> 00:17:26,253
- OH, NO, NO. 
I'M NOT IN THE GROUP YET.

454
00:17:26,253 --> 00:17:30,799
NO, I'M AFRAID I 
JUST "BLUE" MYSELF.

455
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:34,344
- THERE'S GOTTA BE 
A BETTER WAY TO SAY THAT.

456
00:17:34,344 --> 00:17:36,055
[narrator] 
TOBIAS RUSHED TO THE THEATER,

457
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:37,931
HOPING TO BE SEEN.

458
00:17:37,931 --> 00:17:40,059
UNFORTUNATELY, IT WAS DUSK, 
AND HE COULDN'T BE SEEN.

459
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:43,395
[thumping] 
- WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?

460
00:17:43,395 --> 00:17:45,314
[narrator] 
SO, FOR THE SECOND

461
00:17:45,314 --> 00:17:47,941
TIME IN TWO DAYS, THE FAMILY 
GATHERED AT THE HOSPITAL.

462
00:17:47,941 --> 00:17:50,569
- EVERYTHING'S GONNA BE OKAY. 
I'M SURE HE'S GONNA BE FINE.

463
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:52,862
I'M SO SORRY THAT THIS HAPPENED. 
I SPOKE TO HIM JUST BEFORE

464
00:17:52,862 --> 00:17:54,948
HE LEFT THE HOUSE.

465
00:17:54,948 --> 00:17:56,158
- OH, REALLY?

466
00:17:56,158 --> 00:17:57,534
WHAT WAS 
THE LAST THING HE SAID?

467
00:17:57,534 --> 00:17:58,910
- I JUST "BLUE" MYSELF.

468
00:17:58,910 --> 00:18:02,038
- HE SAID SOME 
WONDERFUL THINGS,

469
00:18:02,038 --> 00:18:05,542
INCLUDING THE FACT 
THAT SOMETIMES PEOPLE...

470
00:18:05,542 --> 00:18:08,337
ARE TOO PROUD TO ASK FOR HELP 
WHEN THEY NEED IT.

471
00:18:08,337 --> 00:18:10,589
- OH, GOD! FINE. I NEED YOU! 
- I NEED YOU, OKAY, MICHAEL?

472
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:12,591
- NO, I-I DIDN'T MEAN FOR--

473
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:13,883
- HE WAS A REALTOR, MICHAEL.

474
00:18:13,883 --> 00:18:16,220
NOW MY HUSBAND'S 
IN THE HOSPITAL.

475
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:18,472
- MOM VOLUNTEERED ME 
FOR THE ARMY JUST BECAUSE

476
00:18:18,472 --> 00:18:20,640
THE FAT MAN DARED HER TO.

477
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,142
- WE CAN'T LET THEM TAKE BUSTER.

478
00:18:22,142 --> 00:18:24,936
- I LOST MY WIG, 
MY UNCLE SAM WIG.

479
00:18:24,936 --> 00:18:27,981
- MICHAEL, I AM SITTING ON SOME 
VERY HOT INFORMATION HERE.

480
00:18:27,981 --> 00:18:31,193
I KNOW TOO MUCH. 
I'VE GOT THE THINGY.

481
00:18:31,193 --> 00:18:34,321
HALF IN ENGLISH, 
HALF IN SCRIBBLY.

482
00:18:34,321 --> 00:18:39,118
- MICHAEL, PLEASE, 
WE NEED YOU!

483
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:41,911
- WELL, I HATE TO CANCEL MY 
MEDICAL FOLLOW-UP IN PHOENIX,

484
00:18:41,911 --> 00:18:43,788
BUT YOU GIVE ME 
THE CORPORATE CHECKBOOK,

485
00:18:43,788 --> 00:18:45,039
I'LL SEE WHAT I CAN DO.

486
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:47,417
- EXCUSE ME. 
MRS. FUNKE

487
00:18:47,417 --> 00:18:50,629
- OH, THIS GUY AGAIN. 
- HOW IS HE, DOCTOR?

488
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:52,088
- IT, UH, LOOKS LIKE HE'S DEAD.

489
00:18:52,088 --> 00:18:53,757
- OH, MY GOD!

490
00:18:53,757 --> 00:18:56,135
- OH, LITTLE GUY!

491
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:58,387
THE TEARS AREN'T COMING! 
THE TEARS JUST AREN'T COMING!

492
00:18:58,387 --> 00:18:59,721
- OKAY, OKAY.

493
00:18:59,721 --> 00:19:01,181
- UH, JUST TO BE CLEAR--

494
00:19:01,181 --> 00:19:03,683
LOOKS LIKE HE'S DEAD, 
OR HE IS DEAD?

495
00:19:03,683 --> 00:19:05,769
- IT JUST LOOKS 
LIKE HE'S DEAD.

496
00:19:05,769 --> 00:19:07,771
HE'S GOT, LIKE, 
BLUE PAINT ON HIM OR SOMETHING,

497
00:19:07,771 --> 00:19:09,606
BUT HE'S GOING TO BE FINE.

498
00:19:09,606 --> 00:19:10,857
- WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?

499
00:19:10,857 --> 00:19:13,109
- WHAT A--
