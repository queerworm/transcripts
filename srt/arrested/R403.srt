00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:40,960
[narrator] <i>And his quest</i>
<i>hit a bump early on,</i>

164
00:07:41,043 --> 00:07:42,962
<i>as he struggled to learn the customs</i>

165
00:07:43,045 --> 00:07:45,715
<i>and gestures of the culture</i>
<i>he hoped to adopt.</i>

166
00:07:45,798 --> 00:07:49,427
Oh, God damn it! Am I the only one
who still dresses to fly?

167
00:07:50,636 --> 00:07:52,889
{\an8}Well, there we go. India clean.

168
00:07:54,557 --> 00:07:56,142
Now, how did I...

169
00:07:56,225 --> 00:07:58,728
[narrator] <i>Unfortunately,</i>
<i>recreating the look</i>

170
00:07:58,811 --> 00:08:00,480
<i>of the traditional Indian garb...</i>

171
00:08:00,563 --> 00:08:02,940
-Are you finished? Oh!
<i>-...turned out to be more difficult...</i>

172
00:08:03,024 --> 00:08:05,109
I look like one of those
hot guys from <i>Spartacus.</i>

173
00:08:05,193 --> 00:08:08,613
<i>...without the aid of Pradeep,</i>
<i>the helpful Indian salesman...</i>

174
00:08:08,696 --> 00:08:10,573
I feel like there was less up top.

175
00:08:10,656 --> 00:08:12,867
<i>...who helped him learn how to tie...</i>

176
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:14,994
-Ah, I've got it. Okay, that's--
-[garment tears]

177
00:08:16,871 --> 00:08:18,915
Yes, I actually like this better.

178
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:22,126
[narrator] <i>But he figured he'd wait a beat</i>
<i>on finding his true calling</i>

179
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:24,795
<i>and watch something</i>
<i>to take his mind off Lindsay...</i>

180
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:27,715
How could they not have <i>Failure to Launch?</i>
It's an airplane.

181
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:30,635
What is she doing back there?

182
00:08:32,303 --> 00:08:35,264
[narrator] <i>And after taking the wrong bag</i>
<i>at the airport,</i>

183
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:37,683
<i>Tobias finally arrived in India...</i>

184
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:41,062
And so Tobias Funke embarked on a...
Oh, dear Lord, it's...

185
00:08:41,145 --> 00:08:42,939
[narrator]
<i>...where he was very uncomfortable.</i>

186
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:44,398
...hot! Oh!

187
00:08:44,482 --> 00:08:48,236
[narrator] <i>Not only because the wind</i>
<i>whipped up his mini sarong...</i>

188

I'm Never Nude!

189
00:08:50,488 --> 00:08:51,489
Oh!

190
00:08:51,572 --> 00:08:53,491
{\an8}<i>...but because he looked</i>
<i>the wrong direction</i>

191

<i>when stepping into the street.</i>

192
00:08:55,326 --> 00:08:57,703
Oh, my God.
Did-- did we just hit something?

193
00:08:57,787 --> 00:08:59,205
Shouldn't we stop?

194
00:08:59,288 --> 00:09:01,249
No. It wasn't a cow.

195
00:09:01,332 --> 00:09:03,084
It was just a tourist.

196
00:09:03,167 --> 00:09:04,669
[laughter]

197
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:06,879
[narrator laughs]

198
00:09:07,588 --> 00:09:10,466
[narrator] <i>And this was how Lindsay's path</i>

This isn't my--

00:09:11,801 --> 00:09:15,263
How am I supposed to find out
who I really am dressed like this chick?

201
00:09:15,346 --> 00:09:17,807
[narrator] <i>...took a brief detour</i>

<i>-...at India's famous Mall Mountain.</i>
-It's cute on me.

203
00:09:20,768 --> 00:09:23,145
But I thought
it was supposed to say "Kate."

204
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:26,983
Oh, no, anything under a small
is considered a David Spade.

205
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:29,360
I love this jacket.
I'll give you 60 for it.

206
00:09:29,443 --> 00:09:32,572
[narrator] <i>And the spiritual experience</i>

<i>until she got back to the hotel.</i>

208
00:09:34,156 --> 00:09:35,324
Best coat on the mountain.

209
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:36,742
[narrator] <i>While Tobias' journey</i>

210
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:39,870
<i>saw nothing more</i>
<i>than the inside of a hospital room,</i>

211
00:09:39,954 --> 00:09:43,624
<i>where the staff was being trained</i>
<i>by the same doctor he'd had in America.</i>

212
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:45,418
This man here broke his skull
in two places.

213
00:09:45,501 --> 00:09:47,545
Once outside the airport
and once in the elevator

214
00:09:47,628 --> 00:09:49,922
when his sheet got caught
and he was pulled off his gurney.

215
00:09:50,006 --> 00:09:51,340
-[narrator] <i>Literally.</i>
-[laughter]

216
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:52,967
My name is Tobias...

217
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:54,093
-Oh!
-[thuds]

218
00:09:54,802 --> 00:09:57,305
Now I've broken my skull in a third place.

219
00:09:57,388 --> 00:09:59,307
On this elephant-guy statue.

220
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:01,809
-[narrator] <i>That's when the universe...</i>
-[laughter]

221
00:10:01,892 --> 00:10:04,103
You should be a comedy actor.

222
00:10:04,186 --> 00:10:06,397
<i>...gave Tobias a really sweet compliment.</i>

223
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,275
This is the sign that I've been...
[retching]

224
00:10:09,358 --> 00:10:10,484
<i>...looking for.</i>

225
00:10:12,778 --> 00:10:14,905
<i>-But Lindsay's search would continue...</i>
-Hi, uh...

226
00:10:14,989 --> 00:10:16,866
Were you able to book my 3:00 shaman?

227
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:19,035
<i>...until she could answer</i>
<i>some hard questions.</i>

228
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:22,163
Oh, yes. Did you want the deep wisdom
or just a light ego cleanse?

229
00:10:22,246 --> 00:10:23,456
We do those by the pool.

230
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:24,707
There's a pool?

231
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:27,293
It's hard to tell
because there are so many people in it,

232
00:10:27,376 --> 00:10:28,753
but yes, it is a pool.

233
00:10:28,836 --> 00:10:30,338
Oh, yeah. And, uh...

234
00:10:30,421 --> 00:10:34,383
do you think you can get someone to remove
the smell of lamb from my room?

235
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:36,927
Of course.
And which animal smell would you prefer?

236
00:10:37,011 --> 00:10:38,054
Which do you prefer?

237
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:41,932
[narrator] <i>And soon, she got a deeper</i>
<i>treatment than she had hoped for.</i>

238
00:10:42,016 --> 00:10:43,768
You are living a life without love.

239
00:10:44,268 --> 00:10:48,939
How do I learn to be happy?
You know, to love?

240
00:10:49,357 --> 00:10:51,776
When love is near,
your heart will be happy.

241
00:10:52,276 --> 00:10:55,529
You must live life truthfully.

242
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:58,783
Yeah, no, I do live truthfully,

243
00:10:58,866 --> 00:11:03,079
but I'm just so full of passion.

244
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:04,747
You are so full of [bleep].

245
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:06,374
Yeah, yeah.

246
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:10,252
Although, in my culture,
"full of [bleep]" is kind of like a dig.

247
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:11,754
You'd never say it to a customer.

248
00:11:11,837 --> 00:11:14,006
But yeah, no, I know what you mean.

249
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:17,301
This bag is as fake as you are.

250
00:11:17,385 --> 00:11:19,178
Oh. Well, how do I learn?

251
00:11:19,261 --> 00:11:20,596
Just look at the spelling.

252
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:24,141
-No, I--
-Pull your head out of the sand.

253
00:11:24,225 --> 00:11:26,811
Love is where you left it.

254
00:11:26,894 --> 00:11:29,021
You mean... back home?

255
00:11:30,398 --> 00:11:32,441
The only person back home is Tobias.

256
00:11:32,566 --> 00:11:34,610
You have no children?

257
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:37,154
[narrator] <i>Lindsay thought</i>
<i>she was being hit on.</i>

258
00:11:37,238 --> 00:11:39,031
No. Why do you ask?

259
00:11:39,573 --> 00:11:42,702
Wait a minute. You're saying
I've come halfway around the world

260
00:11:42,785 --> 00:11:45,329
to find out I need to go back home?

261
00:11:46,664 --> 00:11:48,165
I haven't even gone to the beach yet.

262
00:11:48,249 --> 00:11:51,752
[narrator] <i>She had, it was just</i>
<i>too crowded to see the water.</i>

263
00:11:51,836 --> 00:11:54,630
Excuse me, I'd like to talk to you
about my shaman appointment.

264
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:57,758
Specifically, what is your policy
on damaged--

265
00:11:57,842 --> 00:12:00,886
I'm sorry. Your AmEx was declined.
Your account is maxed out.

266
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:03,305
We had to cancel your shaman appointment.

267
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:05,975
No, no, I just talked to the shaman,
just right back at...

268
00:12:08,853 --> 00:12:12,273
Get out! Get out! Go away!
Get out! Get out! Get out!

269
00:12:13,816 --> 00:12:16,569
I'm sorry to yell at you,
but as I said, it was declined.

270
00:12:17,695 --> 00:12:19,113
So get out.

271
00:12:19,196 --> 00:12:21,782
[narrator] <i>But fortunately,</i>
<i>the universe offered a solution</i>

272
00:12:21,866 --> 00:12:23,743
<i>to her financial problem</i>

273
00:12:23,826 --> 00:12:26,495
<i>that only required</i>
<i>she go back on everything</i>

274
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:28,706

[Lucille] <i>Oh, I've got money</i>

277
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:35,254
<i>sitting behind me at the trial.</i>

278
00:12:35,337 --> 00:12:36,464
Would you take a grimace?

279
00:12:36,547 --> 00:12:39,133
[narrator] <i>So it was</i>
<i>with this dual intention</i>

280
00:12:39,216 --> 00:12:42,887
<i>that she reached out</i>
<i>to a husband she'd left behind,</i>

281
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:45,598
<i>with a new sense of inner peace.</i>

282
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:53,814
Oh!

-I'm ready to make this work.

285
00:12:59,695 --> 00:13:01,906
<i>...due to his already weakened spine.</i>

286
00:13:05,493 --> 00:13:09,121
<i>Lindsay shared the news of her epiphany</i>
<i>at a family gathering</i>

<i>when they returned</i>
<i>from their spiritual journey.</i>

288
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:14,376
To get her hands
on the stimulus money, too, right?

289
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:17,046
Stop with the prayer hands.
It just looks like you're out of ideas.

290
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:19,465
Says the least spiritual man I know.

291
00:13:19,548 --> 00:13:23,344
What deal did you strike with her?
What part of her soul did you buy?

292
00:13:23,427 --> 00:13:24,887
All I've asked is that she testify

293
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:27,765
that I was a wonderful mother
who did her best.

294
00:13:27,848 --> 00:13:29,225
So all of it.

295
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:31,310
No, Michael. I'm not a whore.

296
00:13:31,393 --> 00:13:34,230
I don't get any of the money
until after I do the disgusting thing.

297
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:36,440
But I'm not here just for the stimmy.

298
00:13:36,524 --> 00:13:39,777
I'm here because a shaman told me
that love is where I left it.

299
00:13:40,277 --> 00:13:42,029
Which, after much soul searching,

300
00:13:42,112 --> 00:13:45,074
and by process of elimination,
is Tobias.

301
00:13:46,075 --> 00:13:47,243
I got the part.

302
00:13:48,577 --> 00:13:51,789
You know, it's funny,
for I, too, find that I am on a journey.

303
00:13:51,872 --> 00:13:54,542
Although, as we discovered
when our MasterCard bill came back,

304
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:56,001
it was the same one she took,

305
00:13:56,085 --> 00:14:00,005
but mine has confirmed
that I should redouble my efforts

306
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:04,885
to achieve the unachievable dream
of being an actor.

307
00:14:05,302 --> 00:14:10,391
A journey that has left me eager
to connect with my true love.

308
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:14,395
Particularly if she finds her way clear

309
00:14:14,478 --> 00:14:18,941
to covering a 2,000-rupee
City of Hopelessness hospital debt.

310
00:14:19,024 --> 00:14:21,026
The trick is going to be
getting anyone to believe

311
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:22,611
that her husband is straight enough

312
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:24,864
to have a true love that's a woman.

313
00:14:24,947 --> 00:14:26,198
What are you implying?

314
00:14:26,407 --> 00:14:28,784
Oh, I don't think there was any implying
going on at all.

315
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:29,952
Didn't hear any implying.

316
00:14:30,035 --> 00:14:32,538
-I wasn't implying.
-I'm sorry, Mother.

317
00:14:32,621 --> 00:14:34,623
It's just, I've got a bit of a stick
up my bunghole

318
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:37,376
about what I've now found
is a running joke about me.

319
00:14:37,793 --> 00:14:38,794
But let's be honest.

320
00:14:39,211 --> 00:14:42,923
For 2,000 rupees,
we'd both go down on Matthew McConaughey.

321
00:14:43,007 --> 00:14:43,841
Yes, Michael?

322
00:14:43,924 --> 00:14:46,969
[narrator] <i>Two thousand rupees was $36.</i>

323
00:14:47,052 --> 00:14:48,137
I wouldn't.

324

<i>So Lindsay and Tobias were making</i>
<i>a new start as a family...</i>

325

329
00:15:02,651 --> 00:15:05,863
Maybe I can give you a tip. Might want
to put a road up to this place.

330
00:15:05,946 --> 00:15:07,364
[Michael] We paved the neighborhood.

331
00:15:07,448 --> 00:15:09,408
Just waiting for the city
to build a road to it.

332
00:15:09,491 --> 00:15:13,579
[narrator] <i>As Michael prepared to sell,</i>

<i>until after the testimony.</i>

334
00:15:16,624 --> 00:15:17,583
Ready to make a move?

335
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:20,669
As you can see,
I'm ready for a lot that's new.

336
00:15:22,838 --> 00:15:24,340
Oh! Good heavens!

337
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:26,508
Right! Well, this is a great area.

338
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:28,761
There's some wonderful
surgi-centers nearby.

339
00:15:28,844 --> 00:15:30,971
We're doing it. We're really doing this.

340
00:15:31,055 --> 00:15:33,057
[James] Yes! We're gonna
get you in the right house.

341
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:35,142
And it's just the two of you?
You have no children?

342
00:15:35,684 --> 00:15:36,602
We don't.

343
00:15:37,394 --> 00:15:40,981
We should be honest here.
We have no income flow.

344
00:15:41,065 --> 00:15:44,360
No incoming income flow.
We have plenty of outgoing income.

345
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:46,403
No savings, no credit.

346
00:15:46,737 --> 00:15:50,199
I mean, we had some stimmy,
but that went to his hospital bills.

347
00:15:51,575 --> 00:15:54,161
-But there's one thing we do have...
-Work ethic!

348
00:15:54,244 --> 00:15:56,622
Right. No work ethic.
But there's one thing we do have,

349
00:15:56,705 --> 00:15:58,666
we do have a daughter.

350
00:15:58,749 --> 00:16:01,126
I was just on auto-pilot before
when I said we didn't.

351
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:03,212
I should have caught that, yeah, but...

352
00:16:03,295 --> 00:16:06,215
I could've spoken up, but I just wanted
to see if you guys got there.

353
00:16:06,757 --> 00:16:08,300
Well, you guys seem like a great family.

354
00:16:09,009 --> 00:16:11,512
We have to be realistic.
I'm in the real estate business.

355
00:16:11,595 --> 00:16:13,263
It's 2006.

356
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:15,432
That's all good enough for me.

357
00:16:15,516 --> 00:16:16,976
We're gonna put you in a NINJA loan.

358
00:16:17,059 --> 00:16:18,852
"No income, no jobs, no assets."

359
00:16:18,936 --> 00:16:20,813
And you don't have to pay a penny
for two years.

360
00:16:20,896 --> 00:16:22,356
Oh, NINJA, please!

361
00:16:22,439 --> 00:16:24,108
So we'll take something cozy and intimate.

362
00:16:24,191 --> 00:16:26,110
-A one-bedroom.
-Or bigger.

363
00:16:26,193 --> 00:16:27,820
How about something nice?
A three-bedroom?

364
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:29,822
-Three does sound bigger.
-Oh, it definitely is.

365
00:16:29,905 --> 00:16:31,949
[narrator] <i>You have to remember</i>
<i>that this was a time</i>

366
00:16:32,032 --> 00:16:34,785
<i>when banks were eager</i>
<i>to create as much debt as possible.</i>

367
00:16:34,868 --> 00:16:36,912
The five-bedroom, four-car garage.

368
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:40,708
And I know that you guys are gonna be
okay with just one master bathroom,

369
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:43,377
because a lot of people do prefer two.

370
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:45,087
You know, they like to just have it.

371
00:16:45,462 --> 00:16:47,047
Maybe separate, so we have it.

372
00:16:47,131 --> 00:16:49,425
-So we have it. That way we have it.
-That way you have it.

373
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:50,759
Do you think we really need one?

374
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:54,138
I'm just gonna interrupt for a second.
You don't need a wine cellar

375
00:16:54,221 --> 00:16:57,099
if you want to do wine tastings
in your butler's kitchen.

376
00:16:57,182 --> 00:16:59,351
I mean,
this really isn't what we discussed.

377
00:16:59,435 --> 00:17:03,063
Well, we didn't discuss
any of this, but yes,

378
00:17:03,147 --> 00:17:05,774
-I guess, that way, we have it.
-Well, yeah...

379
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:07,735
That way, you'll definitely have it.

380
00:17:07,818 --> 00:17:10,154
And then once you have it,
that way you'll have it.

381
00:17:10,237 --> 00:17:12,322
But do we need a gatehouse?

382
00:17:12,406 --> 00:17:16,702
I just put John Beard
into a house with a double gatehouse.

383
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:18,954
Now, that's John Beard,
he's on television.

384
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:20,289
No one's gonna look down on you

385
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:22,124
just 'cause you have
less than John Beard.

386
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:24,209
-Is this crazy?
-I think so.

387
00:17:24,668 --> 00:17:27,004
-We'll take the double gatehouse.
-Is that what you thought?

388
00:17:27,087 --> 00:17:28,672
-That way, we'll have it.
-We have it.

389
00:17:28,756 --> 00:17:29,757
And that way, you have it.

390
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:32,051
[narrator] <i>There was a lot of this</i>
<i>going on back then.</i>

391
00:17:32,134 --> 00:17:33,510
This way, we have it.

392
00:17:33,594 --> 00:17:34,928
That way, you'll have it!

393
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:36,472
Good point!

394
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:40,726
[narrator] <i>And Tobias began pursuing</i>
<i>the life of an actor.</i>

395
00:17:41,101 --> 00:17:44,021
I'm an actor. You're an agent.
You do the math.

396
00:17:44,438 --> 00:17:45,564
I want you to represent me.

397
00:17:45,856 --> 00:17:49,276
In other words, you do the math.
The money, the negotiating.

398
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:51,820
You know I'm not
that kind of agent, right?

399
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:53,655
I'm a real estate agent. I'm a predator.

400
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:55,741
I sell giant houses to very poor people

401
00:17:55,824 --> 00:17:57,743
who can't afford them
with predatory loans.

402
00:17:57,826 --> 00:17:59,453
That's the money stuff I don't understand.

403
00:17:59,536 --> 00:18:02,247
All you need do is tell people
what a terrific actor I am,

404
00:18:02,331 --> 00:18:04,875
'cause I can't do it believably.
What do you say?

405
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:06,585
Sounds like it shouldn't be too much work.
