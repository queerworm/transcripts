00:00:01,459 --> 00:00:02,102
male narrator: NOW THE STORY 
OF A WEALTHY FAMILY

2
00:00:02,102 --> 00:00:03,103
WHO LOST EVERYTHING...

3
00:00:03,103 --> 00:00:06,172
AND THE ONE SON 
WHO HAD NO CHOICE

4
00:00:06,172 --> 00:00:07,965
BUT TO KEEP THEM ALL TOGETHER.

5
00:00:13,846 --> 00:00:15,556
IT'S "ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT."

6
00:00:18,351 --> 00:00:20,561
GEORGE MICHAEL 
WAS GETTING READY FOR SCHOOL

7
00:00:20,561 --> 00:00:23,731
WHEN HE CAME ACROSS A BOX 
OF LOVE LETTERS HE'D WRITTEN

8
00:00:23,731 --> 00:00:26,442
BUT NEVER SENT 
TO HIS COUSIN MAEBY.

9
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:30,405
ONE LETTER TITLED 
"IF YOU WEREN'T MY COUSIN,"

10
00:00:30,405 --> 00:00:32,990
WAS PARTICULARLY INCRIMINATING.

11
00:00:32,990 --> 00:00:34,284
- HEY, PAL, YOU WANT 
A RIDE TO SCHOOL?

12
00:00:34,284 --> 00:00:37,078
- UM, NO. 
ACTUALLY, I'M--

13
00:00:37,078 --> 00:00:39,414
I'M RIDING WITH THE VEALS, 
ANN'S PARENTS.

14
00:00:39,414 --> 00:00:41,332
WELL, YOU DON'T NEED TO BE 
ALL PENNED UP WITH THEM.

15
00:00:41,332 --> 00:00:43,376
I'LL DRIVE YOU BOTH. 
COME ON, WE'LL TAKE THE STAIRS.

16
00:00:43,376 --> 00:00:44,794
- RIGHT. 
HERE'S THE THING THOUGH.

17
00:00:44,794 --> 00:00:46,003
IT'S KIND OF CRAMPED IN THERE.

18
00:00:46,003 --> 00:00:47,588
PLUS, A LOT OF KIDS ARE STILL 
TALKING ABOUT

19
00:00:47,588 --> 00:00:49,090
WHEN YOU TOOK DOWN 
THAT HOMECOMING BANNER.

20
00:00:50,966 --> 00:00:53,261
- LISTEN, ARE YOU EMBARRASSED 
TO BE SEEN IN THAT CAR?

21
00:00:53,261 --> 00:00:55,596
- IT'S NOT A CAR. 
BUT--BUT, NO.

22
00:00:57,307 --> 00:00:58,933
- 7I'VE GOT TO GET A NEW CAR.

23
00:00:58,933 --> 00:01:00,643
narrator: GEORGE MICHAEL DECIDED

24
00:01:00,643 --> 00:01:02,937
TO HIDE THE LOVE LETTERS 
IN THE ATTIC,

25
00:01:02,937 --> 00:01:05,022
ALTHOUGH MAEBY 
HAD HER OWN PROBLEMS.

26
00:01:05,022 --> 00:01:07,108
AFTER LYING ABOUT HER AGE,

27
00:01:07,108 --> 00:01:08,168
SHE HAD CONNED HER WAY 
INTO A JOB

28
00:01:08,168 --> 00:01:10,945
AS A MOVIE STUDIO EXECUTIVE.

29
00:01:10,945 --> 00:01:12,530
- DID YOU GET THE STACK 
OF SCRIPTS THAT I SENT YOU?

30
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:14,282
'CAUSE YOU 
CERTAINLY LOOK WELL-RESTED.

31
00:01:14,282 --> 00:01:15,408
- MARRY ME.

32
00:01:15,408 --> 00:01:16,409
- HA!

33
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:17,660
I NEED YOUR NOTES 
ON THOSE TOMORROW.

34
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:18,661
WANNA HAVE A DRINK?

35
00:01:18,661 --> 00:01:20,538
- YEAH. WHY DON'T WE ASK 
YOUR WIFE TO COME WITH US?

36
00:01:20,538 --> 00:01:22,248
- OKAY, THEN. 
I'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW.

37
00:01:22,248 --> 00:01:25,376
narrator: AND DOWNSTAIRS, 
BUSTER PAID A VISIT.

38
00:01:25,376 --> 00:01:27,670
- HEY, BROTHER. 
I NEED A FAVOR.

39
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:28,838
- OF COURSE YOU DO.

40
00:01:28,838 --> 00:01:29,839
I'M ON FURLOUGH THIS WEEK,

41
00:01:29,839 --> 00:01:31,632
AND EVERYBODY'S OUT DANCING 
WITH THEIR GIRL,

42
00:01:31,632 --> 00:01:32,800
AND I'M HOME SITTING WITH MOM.

43
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:34,385
- MOM DOESN'T WANNA GO DANCING?

44
00:01:34,385 --> 00:01:35,428
I THINK THE AGE DIFFERENCE

45
00:01:35,428 --> 00:01:37,430
IS REALLY STARTING 
TO CATCH UP TO US.

46
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:38,764
- MAYBE IT'S TIME 
YOU GOT OUT THERE

47
00:01:38,764 --> 00:01:40,057
AND STARTED MEETING PEOPLE, 
YOU KNOW,

48
00:01:40,057 --> 00:01:41,058
MEETIN' WOMEN.

49
00:01:41,058 --> 00:01:42,727
MEETIN' WOMEN WHO DIDN'T GIVE 
BIRTH TO YOU.

50
00:01:42,727 --> 00:01:45,146
- MAYBE YOU COULD GO OUT WITH ME 
AND HELP ME MEET WOMEN.

51
00:01:45,146 --> 00:01:46,689
- YEAH, THAT'S NOT REALLY 
WHAT I MEANT.

52
00:01:46,689 --> 00:01:48,441
I HAVE A VERY BUSY SCHEDULE 
RIGHT NOW.

53
00:01:48,441 --> 00:01:50,151
- MY SCHEDULE, HOWEVER,

54
00:01:50,151 --> 00:01:52,612
IS AS OPEN AS MY RELATIONSHIP 
WITH MY WIFE.

55
00:01:52,612 --> 00:01:54,864
SO WHY DON'T WE PAIR UP?

56
00:01:56,073 --> 00:01:57,533
AND--AND HIT 
THE TOWN TOGETHER.

57
00:01:57,533 --> 00:01:59,619
- OH. 
- I'LL BE YOUR WINGMAN.

58
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:02,205
EVEN IF IT MEANS ME 
TAKING A CHUBBY,

59
00:02:02,205 --> 00:02:03,998
I WILL SUCK IT UP.

60
00:02:03,998 --> 00:02:06,376
- BOY, THAT'S ENOUGH 
FAMILY STUFF FOR TODAY.

61
00:02:06,376 --> 00:02:08,169
- THAT'S RIGHT, MICHAEL.

62
00:02:08,169 --> 00:02:09,712
GUESS WHO JUST GOT FIRED?

63
00:02:09,712 --> 00:02:12,840
narrator: GOB WAS RECENTLY HIRED 
BY THE BLUTH COMPANY'S RIVAL,

64
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,884
SITWELL ENTERPRISES.

65
00:02:14,884 --> 00:02:16,802
AND ALTHOUGH 
HE STARTED OFF WELL...

66
00:02:16,802 --> 00:02:19,013
- FIFTY-TWO PERCENT 
OF THE COUNTRY IS SINGLE.

67
00:02:19,013 --> 00:02:21,766
THAT'S A MARKET THAT'S BEEN 
DOMINATED BY APARTMENT RENTALS.

68
00:02:21,766 --> 00:02:23,601
LET'S TAKE SOME OF THAT MARKET.

69
00:02:23,601 --> 00:02:26,521
I CALL IT "SINGLE CITY."

70
00:02:26,521 --> 00:02:29,023
narrator: 
HIS IDEAS FAILED TO EVOLVE.

71
00:02:29,023 --> 00:02:31,108
- IT'S LIKE, "HEY, YOU WANNA 
GO DOWN TO THE WHIRLPOOL?"

72
00:02:31,108 --> 00:02:32,652
"YEAH. I DON'T HAVE A HUSBAND."

73
00:02:32,652 --> 00:02:34,320
I CALL IT "SWING CITY."

74
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:37,157
- LET'S GET INTO SOME NEW AREAS, 
IF YOU DON'T MIND.

75
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:40,451
narrator: BUT GOB CONTINUED 
TO FINE-TUNE HIS FIRST ONE.

76
00:02:40,451 --> 00:02:42,537
- HOW DO WE FILTER OUT 
THE TEASES?

77
00:02:42,537 --> 00:02:44,664
WE DON'T LET THEM IN.

78
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:46,166
THIS GOES FOR THE GUYS, TOO,

79
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:48,709
BECAUSE SOMETIMES THE GUYS 
ARE TAPPED OUT.

80
00:02:48,709 --> 00:02:50,253
BUT CHECK YOUR LEASE, MAN,

81
00:02:50,253 --> 00:02:52,755
BECAUSE YOU'RE LIVIN' 
IN [bleep] CITY.

82
00:02:53,506 --> 00:02:54,632
- YOU'RE FIRED.

83
00:02:54,632 --> 00:02:55,800
- SO GET THIS.

84
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,010
I TOOK HIS DRESS EYEBROWS.

85
00:02:58,010 --> 00:02:59,720
narrator: SITWELL SUFFERED 
FROM A DISEASE

86
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:01,639
THAT RENDERED 
HIM COMPLETELY HAIRLESS.

87
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:03,140
- HE'S NOT GONNA BE HAPPY 
ABOUT THAT.

88
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:04,767
- NO, ESPECIALLY 
WHEN HE GOES TO THE OPERA

89
00:03:04,767 --> 00:03:06,143
WITH TWO MUSTACHES 
ON HIS FOREHEAD.

90
00:03:06,143 --> 00:03:07,478
OH, BUT THE GOOD NEWS IS:

91
00:03:07,478 --> 00:03:08,938
I'M COMING BACK 
TO THE BLUTH COMPANY.

92
00:03:08,938 --> 00:03:10,606
[laughs]

93
00:03:10,606 --> 00:03:12,900
- GOB, WE'RE GETTIN' 
ALL JAMMED UP HERE, OKAY?

94
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:14,485
THE ONLY REASON 
THAT YOU WERE PRESIDENT

95
00:03:14,485 --> 00:03:15,486
WAS TO APPEASE THE BOARD.

96
00:03:15,486 --> 00:03:17,112
THEY'VE BEEN APPEASED. 
I GOT THE JOB.

97
00:03:17,112 --> 00:03:19,073
- NO, I DON'T 
NEED TO BE PRESIDENT.

98
00:03:19,073 --> 00:03:22,034
I JUST LIKED 
HAVING AN OFFICE, A TITLE.

99
00:03:22,034 --> 00:03:24,161
- SURE. 
- PAYCHECK.

100
00:03:24,161 --> 00:03:25,330
ALSO I NEED A COMPANY CAR.

101
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:27,415
YOU DO HAVE TO MATCH 
SITWELL THERE.

102
00:03:27,415 --> 00:03:28,999
- HANG ON A SEC. 
HE GAVE YOU A COMPANY CAR?

103
00:03:28,999 --> 00:03:31,085
- YEAH, AND IT WAS WAY BETTER 
THAN ANY OF THE COMPANY CARS

104
00:03:31,085 --> 00:03:32,253
DAD EVER GAVE ME.

105
00:03:32,253 --> 00:03:33,254
- YEAH, RIGHT.

106
00:03:33,254 --> 00:03:34,714
- I MEAN, THE CAMARO WAS OKAY.

107
00:03:36,841 --> 00:03:39,635
- ARE YOU SERIOUS? 
DAD GAVE YOU THE CAMARO?

108
00:03:39,635 --> 00:03:41,637
I THOUGHT YOU WON THAT 
ON "CARD SHARKS."

109
00:03:41,637 --> 00:03:45,182
- MICHAEL, I WAS NEVER 
ON "CARD SHARKS."

110
00:03:45,182 --> 00:03:47,142
DAD TOLD US NOT TO TELL YOU.

111
00:03:47,352 --> 00:03:49,562
narrator: MICHAEL DECIDED 
TO CONFRONT HIS FATHER,

112
00:03:49,562 --> 00:03:52,732
WHO'D BEEN LIVING IN THE ATTIC 
SINCE HE'D ESCAPED FROM PRISON.

113
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:54,775
- DAD? 
- OH, THANK GOD YOU'RE HERE.

114
00:03:54,775 --> 00:03:57,862
I'M GOING CRAZY 
WITH THE BOREDOM, MICHAEL.

115
00:03:57,862 --> 00:03:59,697
AT LEAST IN PRISON, 
WE HAD KNIFE FIGHTS,

116
00:03:59,697 --> 00:04:01,115
AND WE HAD MOVIE NIGHT.

117
00:04:01,115 --> 00:04:02,492
AND ONCE, BOTH.

118
00:04:02,492 --> 00:04:03,343
THOSE MEN DID NOT ENJOY 
"SOAPDISH."

119
00:04:03,343 --> 00:04:05,911
I THINK 
YOU HAVE TO KNOW THAT WORLD.

120
00:04:05,911 --> 00:04:07,997
- YEAH, LISTEN, 
DID YOU BUY A COMPANY CAR

121
00:04:07,997 --> 00:04:09,665
FOR EVERYONE IN THE FAMILY 
EXCEPT ME?

122
00:04:09,665 --> 00:04:11,709
- WELL, ACCORDING TO THE BOOKS, 
I GAVE YOU FOUR.

123
00:04:11,709 --> 00:04:12,710
I'M SERIOUS.

124
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:15,129
I'M DRIVING A STAIRCASE, 
FOR GOD'S SAKE, OKAY?

125
00:04:15,129 --> 00:04:16,922
IT SMELLS LIKE GAS. 
I GET HOP-ONS.

126
00:04:16,922 --> 00:04:18,633
WELL, OF COURSE. 
YOU'RE GONNA GET HOP-ONS.

127
00:04:18,633 --> 00:04:19,925
- I PULL DOWN BANNERS, 
ALL RIGHT?

128
00:04:19,925 --> 00:04:21,176
AND MOST IMPORTANTLY, DAD,

129
00:04:21,176 --> 00:04:23,471
MY SON DOES NOT LIKE 
TO BE SEEN IN IT.

130
00:04:23,471 --> 00:04:25,848
- BUT HE LIKES BEING SEEN 
WITH THAT GIRL?

131
00:04:25,848 --> 00:04:27,892
- IT MAKES NO SENSE, I KNOW. 
- IT DOESN'T.

132
00:04:27,892 --> 00:04:30,728
I NEVER GAVE YOU 
A-A COMPANY CAR.

133
00:04:30,728 --> 00:04:33,230
NO, I GAVE YOU SOMETHING 
FAR MORE IMPORTANT.

134
00:04:33,230 --> 00:04:35,024
I GAVE YOU COMPANY, 
WHICH, APPARENTLY,

135
00:04:35,024 --> 00:04:36,191
YOU DON'T WANT TO GIVE TO ME.

136
00:04:36,191 --> 00:04:37,234
- YOU'RE NOT LISTENING TO ME.

137
00:04:37,234 --> 00:04:38,986
I'D LOVE TO SIT AND CHAT. 
- I'M LONELY UP HERE.

138
00:04:38,986 --> 00:04:40,237
- I'VE GOT TO GET 
AN EARLY START,

139
00:04:40,237 --> 00:04:41,864
BECAUSE I'M EXPECTING HEADWINDS 
ON THE STAIR CAR.

140
00:04:41,864 --> 00:04:42,865
- YOU SEE ANYBODY HERE?

141
00:04:42,865 --> 00:04:44,116
YOU COULD BRING ME A BOOK.

142
00:04:44,116 --> 00:04:46,286
POP-POP GETS A GRISHAM?

143
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:48,913
- SO YOU TAKE YOUR MOM 
TO WORK EVERY DAY?

144
00:04:48,913 --> 00:04:49,914
BUMMER.

145
00:04:49,914 --> 00:04:51,248
MOMS ARE SUCH A PAIN IN THE ASS, 
HUH?

146
00:04:51,248 --> 00:04:52,249
IT'S LIKE "DIE ALREADY!"

147
00:04:52,249 --> 00:04:53,293
[laughs]

148
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:55,169
- I LOVE MY MOTHER. 
- HUH?

149
00:04:55,169 --> 00:04:58,881
- SHE'S ONE OF THE TWO MOST 
IMPORTANT PEOPLE IN MY LIFE.

150
00:04:58,881 --> 00:05:00,341
YOU KNOW, SHE AND QUINCY.

151
00:05:00,341 --> 00:05:02,051
narrator: A SPOKESMAN 
FOR MR. JONES

152
00:05:02,051 --> 00:05:03,803
DENIES THEY'VE EVER MET,

153
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:07,264
ALTHOUGH HE COULD NOT EXPLAIN 
THE SIX SIGNED GOLD RECORDS

154
00:05:07,264 --> 00:05:08,891
IN STARLA'S APARTMENT.

155
00:05:08,891 --> 00:05:11,185
I COULD NEVER BE WITH A MAN 
WHO DOESN'T LOVE HIS MOTHER.

156
00:05:13,187 --> 00:05:14,355
- WOW.

157
00:05:14,355 --> 00:05:15,690
SO, MICHAEL, LISTEN.

158
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:17,775
I'M HERE TO CONVINCE YOU 
TO HIRE ME BACK.

159
00:05:17,775 --> 00:05:19,109
I'M AN IDEAS MAN, MICHAEL.

160
00:05:19,109 --> 00:05:21,195
I THINK I PROVED THAT 
WITH [bleep] MOUNTAIN.

161
00:05:21,195 --> 00:05:23,323
LISTEN, I WANT THIS, MICHAEL.

162
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:25,533
I'M GONNA PROVE TO YOU THAT 
I'M WORTHY OF REHIRING

163
00:05:25,533 --> 00:05:28,536
IF IT TAKES EVERY OUNCE OF 
DETERMINATION THAT I'VE GOT.

164
00:05:31,288 --> 00:05:32,957
- WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

165
00:05:32,957 --> 00:05:35,042
- DID YOU WANT ME TO STAY 
AND DO THAT?

166
00:05:38,045 --> 00:05:39,672
- BARRY.

167
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:41,340
- GOOD NEWS 
AND EVEN BETTER NEWS.

168
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:43,133
YOUR COMPANY'S STOCK 
IS UNFROZEN,

169
00:05:43,133 --> 00:05:45,260
AND MY LAWSUIT AGAINST THE 
L.A. KINGS IS MOVING FORWARD.

170
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:46,261
- HOW DID THAT HAPPEN?

171
00:05:46,261 --> 00:05:47,722
- MAYBE I STOOD ABOVE 
THE PLEXIGLAS

172
00:05:47,722 --> 00:05:48,806
AND A PUCK HIT ME.

173
00:05:48,806 --> 00:05:50,433
IT COULD HAPPEN. 
- NO, THE STOCK.

174
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:52,393
NOW, THAT MEANS WE CAN SELL, 
RIGHT?

175
00:05:52,393 --> 00:05:53,728
WE CAN DO 
WHATEVER WE WANT WITH IT?

176
00:05:53,728 --> 00:05:55,438
- I'LL TELL YOU ONE THING 
YOU DON'T WANT TO DO

177
00:05:55,438 --> 00:05:56,647
IS BUY STOCK 
IN THE L.A. KINGS.

178
00:05:56,647 --> 00:05:57,690
- WHAT ABOUT A CAR?

179
00:05:57,690 --> 00:05:58,983
DO YOU THINK I COULD 
SELL ENOUGH TO BUY A CAR?

180
00:05:58,983 --> 00:06:00,067
- I THOUGHT YOU HAD FOUR.

181
00:06:00,067 --> 00:06:01,444
OH, YOU MEAN A REAL ONE. 
YEAH, SURE.

182
00:06:01,444 --> 00:06:02,445
YOU CAN GET ONE,

183
00:06:02,445 --> 00:06:04,739
AS LONG AS EVERYONE DOESN'T SELL 
THE COMPANY STOCK AT ONCE.

184
00:06:04,739 --> 00:06:06,991
YOU DON'T WANT SOMEONE ELSE 
TO GET CONTROL OF THE COMPANY.

185
00:06:06,991 --> 00:06:07,992
- RIGHT.

186
00:06:07,992 --> 00:06:09,535
GOT TO KEEP THE COMPANY 
INTACT, RIGHT?

187
00:06:09,535 --> 00:06:11,496
THE OTHER PEOPLE 
SHOULDN'T RISK SELLING THEIR--

188
00:06:11,496 --> 00:06:13,372
MAYBE YOU CAN DRAFT UP 
A LETTER TO THE INVESTORS.

189
00:06:13,372 --> 00:06:17,126
"YES, THE STOCK IS UNFROZEN. 
WE URGE YOU NOT TO SELL."

190
00:06:17,126 --> 00:06:18,168
- UH, YEAH.

191
00:06:18,168 --> 00:06:19,378
WH--WHAT YOU JUST SAID 
WAS PERFECT.

192
00:06:19,378 --> 00:06:20,713
WHY DO YOU WANT ME TO WRITE IT?

193
00:06:20,713 --> 00:06:22,089
- JUST SEND IT OUT 
ON YOUR STATIONERY

194
00:06:22,089 --> 00:06:23,257
AND DO IT QUICKLY.

195
00:06:23,257 --> 00:06:24,717
I HAVE A CAR TO BUY.

196
00:06:24,717 --> 00:06:27,011
narrator: MEANWHILE, 
MAEBY SNUCK UPSTAIRS

197
00:06:27,011 --> 00:06:29,138
TO SECRETLY READ HER SCRIPTS.

198
00:06:29,138 --> 00:06:30,806
OW!

199
00:06:30,806 --> 00:06:32,642
BACK TO FILM SCHOOL, [bleep].

200
00:06:35,185 --> 00:06:37,522
narrator: AND GEORGE SR. 
WAS ONLY TOO HAPPY

201
00:06:37,522 --> 00:06:39,023
TO HAVE SOMETHING TO READ.

202
00:06:39,023 --> 00:06:41,400
- "ARMAGEDDON II: ARMAGEDDON."

203
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,235
THAT'S A BAD TITLE.

204
00:06:43,235 --> 00:06:44,695
[scoffs]

205
00:06:44,695 --> 00:06:47,197
narrator: MEANWHILE, 
MICHAEL WENT TO GET A GOOD DEAL

206
00:06:47,197 --> 00:06:48,491
ON A MODEST COMPANY CAR.

207
00:06:48,491 --> 00:06:49,992
- OH, SOMETHING LIKE THIS?

208
00:06:49,992 --> 00:06:51,744
WE HAVE, LIKE, 400 OF THESE.

209
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:54,079
- I-I DON'T NEED 
ANYTHING TOO POPULAR.

210
00:06:54,079 --> 00:06:56,123
- OH, THEY'RE NOT POPULAR. 
WE HAVE 400 OF THEM.

211
00:06:56,123 --> 00:06:58,876
- SOLD.

212
00:06:58,876 --> 00:07:00,920
ALTHOUGH, UH, 
I'M WONDERING IF MAYBE

213
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,337
IT SHOULD JUST BE 
A LITTLE BIT NICER.

214
00:07:02,337 --> 00:07:03,798
I GOT A KID, 
IS WHAT I'M THINKING,

215
00:07:03,798 --> 00:07:04,965
AND SAFETY'S KIND OF A FACTOR.

216
00:07:04,965 --> 00:07:06,133
BUT NOTHING TOO FLASHY.

217
00:07:06,133 --> 00:07:07,927
- THIS IS IT, ISN'T IT?

218
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:09,470
I CAN TELL. 
YOU'RE EXCITED.

219
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:11,431
- I AM. 
- I'LL DRAW UP THE PAPERS.

220
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:15,435
- UNLESS YOU THINK 
IT'S TOO DRAB.

221
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:17,227
- AND IT GETS 
VERY GOOD MILEAGE.

222
00:07:17,227 --> 00:07:18,813
- YEAH, WELL, IT, UH...

223
00:07:18,813 --> 00:07:20,440
IT LOOKS LIGHT.

224
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,316
YOU KNOW, I'M NOT 
SO CONCERNED ABOUT MILEAGE.

225
00:07:22,316 --> 00:07:23,901
I SPENT THE LAST 10 YEARS 
ON A BIKE,

226
00:07:23,901 --> 00:07:25,945
WITH THE EXCEPTION 
OF THE STAIR CAR.

227
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:27,488
- OH, YOU'RE THE STAIR CAR GUY.

228
00:07:27,488 --> 00:07:28,989
YOU TOOK DOWN OUR BANNER.

229
00:07:29,657 --> 00:07:30,783
- YEAH, SORRY.

230
00:07:30,783 --> 00:07:32,201
I GOT A HOP-ON.

231
00:07:32,201 --> 00:07:33,453
I GOT DISTRACTED.

232
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:34,537
I HATE THIS.

233
00:07:35,788 --> 00:07:37,665
- I LIKE THESE SUNGLASSES. 
THEY COME WITH ANY CAR?

234
00:07:37,665 --> 00:07:38,833
- JUST THIS ONE.

235
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:41,461
THEY THROW THESE EXTRAS AT YOU 
BECAUSE IT'S SO IMPRACTICAL.

236
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:42,462
NO BACK SEAT.

237
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:43,921
IT ATTRACTS SO MANY TICKETS.

238
00:07:43,921 --> 00:07:45,339
THE INSURANCE ALONE 
COSTS AS MUCH

239
00:07:45,339 --> 00:07:46,924
AS THE LAST THREE CARS WE SAW.

240
00:07:46,924 --> 00:07:48,759
- THE WINDBREAKER? 
WINDBREAKER COMES WITH IT TOO?

241
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:49,760
I GUESS. 
I DON'T KNOW.

242
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,471
I'VE NEVER SOLD ONE 
OF THESE BEFORE, SO--

243
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:52,805
- I'LL TAKE IT.

244
00:07:58,185 --> 00:08:00,229
narrator: MICHAEL HAD JUST 
INDULGED HIMSELF

245
00:08:00,229 --> 00:08:01,647
WITH AN EXPENSIVE SPORTS CAR...

246
00:08:01,647 --> 00:08:03,733
- AND HERE AGAIN, PLEASE.

247
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:06,401
- WHILE BUSTER INDULGED 
IN A NIGHT OUT WITH TOBIAS.

248
00:08:06,401 --> 00:08:09,446
- THIS PLACE IS EXACTLY 
WHAT I HAD HOPED FOR.

249
00:08:09,446 --> 00:08:11,031
ALL LADIES.

250
00:08:12,575 --> 00:08:14,284
- WELL, I'VE HEARD 
THAT THIS UNIFORM

251
00:08:14,284 --> 00:08:15,285
IS THE BEST WAY TO MEET--

252
00:08:15,285 --> 00:08:16,286
[gasps]

253
00:08:16,286 --> 00:08:18,372
LUCILLE 2. 
- BUSTER!

254
00:08:18,372 --> 00:08:19,665
- SO YOU'RE BACK.

255
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:22,042
- OH, I'M BACK, BUSTER! 
- YEAH.

256
00:08:22,042 --> 00:08:24,003
- AND I AM ROCK STEADY!

257
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:25,713
NO MORE DIZZIES.

258
00:08:25,713 --> 00:08:28,048
narrator: LUCILLE AUSTERO 
HAD JUST RETURNED

259
00:08:28,048 --> 00:08:30,425
FROM A MONTH-LONG STAY 
AT A FACILITY

260
00:08:30,425 --> 00:08:32,637
THAT SPECIALIZED 
IN THE TREATMENT OF VERTIGO.

261
00:08:33,095 --> 00:08:34,096
- AH.

262
00:08:34,096 --> 00:08:35,848
AH, JUST A MINUTE. 
YOU'RE OKAY.

263
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:37,391
YOU'RE OKAY. YOU'RE OKAY.

264
00:08:37,391 --> 00:08:38,768
WE'RE OKAY. 
WE'RE OKAY!

265
00:08:38,768 --> 00:08:39,977
SOMEBODY'LL BE HERE IN A SECOND.

266
00:08:39,977 --> 00:08:42,187
WE'RE OKAY. 
WE'RE OKAY.

267
00:08:42,187 --> 00:08:44,273
I AM STABLE AS A TABLE.

268
00:08:44,273 --> 00:08:45,357
- MM.

269
00:08:45,357 --> 00:08:48,528
- SO, IS THERE A-- 
A GIRL IN YOUR LIFE?

270
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:49,904
- [laughs]

271
00:08:49,904 --> 00:08:52,532
WELL, I WOULD HARDLY CALL 
MY MOTHER A GIRL,

272
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:54,575
BUT, YEAH, SHE'S STILL 
VERY MUCH A PART OF MY LIFE.

273
00:08:54,575 --> 00:08:58,621
- NO, I MEAN, UH, SOMEONE 
WHO MAKES YOU HEAR MUSIC.

274
00:08:58,621 --> 00:09:02,374
- OH, WELL, 
SHE MOSTLY LIKES TALK RADIO.

275
00:09:02,374 --> 00:09:06,962
- I MEAN A GIRL WHO 
MAKES YOU FEEL ROMANTIC,

276
00:09:06,962 --> 00:09:09,506
AND ALSO WHO MAKES YOU 
HEAR BEAUTIFUL MUSIC.

277
00:09:09,506 --> 00:09:12,134
- [laughs] 
OH. NO.

278
00:09:12,134 --> 00:09:16,305
- I GUESS WHAT 
I'M TRYING TO SAY IS--

279
00:09:16,305 --> 00:09:19,559
- [singing] 
START SPREADING THE NEWS

280
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:21,268
- EVERYBODY THINKS 
THEY'RE FRANK SINATRA.

281
00:09:21,268 --> 00:09:23,020
- [singing] I'M LEAVING TODAY

282
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:25,898
- MAYBE WE COULD START ANEW.

283
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:28,358
- OH.

284
00:09:29,193 --> 00:09:32,154
narrator: AND LATER, MICHAEL GOT 
AN URGENT CALL FROM HIS MOTHER.

285
00:09:32,154 --> 00:09:34,031
- HE'S WITH HER AGAIN.

286
00:09:34,031 --> 00:09:35,675
BUSTER'S TAKEN UP 
WITH THAT LUCILLE 2.

287
00:09:35,675 --> 00:09:38,744
- THAT'S WHY YOU 
CALLED ME HERE?

288
00:09:38,744 --> 00:09:40,162
I'VE GOT MY SECRETARY 
BRINGING OVER

289
00:09:40,162 --> 00:09:41,288
A BUNCH OF IMPORTANT PAPERS

290
00:09:41,288 --> 00:09:42,665
BECAUSE I THOUGHT 
THIS WAS URGENT.

291
00:09:42,665 --> 00:09:43,833
- WELL, IT'S ALL YOUR FAULT.

292
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:46,877
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO INSISTED 
HE GET AWAY FROM MOTHER.

293
00:09:46,877 --> 00:09:48,671
- WELL, I WASN'T TRYING 
TO SEND HIM TO A NEW ONE.

294
00:09:48,671 --> 00:09:50,422
WHERE IS HE? 
- HE'S ON THE BALCONY.

295
00:09:52,007 --> 00:09:54,844
- BUSTER?

296
00:09:54,844 --> 00:09:56,971
- MOM'S BECOMING 
A LITTLE CONTROLLING.

297
00:09:56,971 --> 00:09:57,972
- WHAT TIPPED YOU OFF?

298
00:09:57,972 --> 00:09:59,724
WHEN SHE LOCKED YOU OUT 
ON THE BALCONY AGAIN?

299
00:09:59,724 --> 00:10:00,725
- THAT WAS HALF MY FAULT.

300
00:10:00,725 --> 00:10:03,603
I THOUGHT I SAW A GRAHAM CRACKER 
OUT THERE.

301
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:05,354
- YOU BAITED THE BALCONY?

302
00:10:05,354 --> 00:10:06,856
PROVE IT.

303
00:10:06,856 --> 00:10:09,233
- SO I DON'T TYPICALLY 
TAKE SIDES WITH MOTHER,

304
00:10:09,233 --> 00:10:12,361
BUT I-I-I DO AGREE 
THAT LUCILLE 2

305
00:10:12,361 --> 00:10:15,197
MIGHT NOT BE 
THE BEST CHOICE FOR YOU.

306
00:10:15,197 --> 00:10:16,490
- I WOULDN'T EVEN 
HAVE BEEN THERE

307
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:18,200
IF MOM WANTED TO GO BOWLING.

308
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,661
HOW AM I GONNA MEET SOMEONE 
WHO HAS MY INTERESTS?

309
00:10:20,661 --> 00:10:22,079
- HI, MICHAEL. 
- HEY. GREAT.

310
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:23,497
- I HAVE THOSE PAPERS 
FOR YOU TO SIGN.

311
00:10:23,497 --> 00:10:24,539
- PERFECT.

312
00:10:24,539 --> 00:10:26,667
- BY THE WAY, 
I LOVE YOUR MOTHER.

313
00:10:26,667 --> 00:10:29,169
- OH, YEAH, I DO TOO. 
- OH.

314
00:10:31,046 --> 00:10:34,634
- I THINK I MAY HAVE FOUND 
A NEW GIRL FOR BUSTER.

315
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:35,635
- GOOD.

316
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:38,428
THAT LUCILLE ISN'T REALLY 
INTERESTED IN BUSTER ANYWAY.

317
00:10:38,428 --> 00:10:40,514
SHE'S JUST TRYING 
TO GET EVEN WITH ME.

318
00:10:40,514 --> 00:10:41,932
- GET EVEN WITH YOU FOR WHAT?

319
00:10:41,932 --> 00:10:44,434
- SHE WANTED ME TO LET IN 
HER REMODELING CREW

320
00:10:44,434 --> 00:10:46,103
WHILE SHE WAS OUT OF TOWN.

321
00:10:46,103 --> 00:10:47,312
- WAIT A MINUTE.

322
00:10:47,312 --> 00:10:49,064
THIS TUB'S A LITTLE BIGGER 
THAN IT USED TO BE.

323
00:10:49,064 --> 00:10:50,065
narrator: IT WAS.

324
00:10:50,065 --> 00:10:51,734
INSTEAD OF LETTING 
THE CONSTRUCTION CREW

325
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:53,277
INTO LUCILLE AUSTERO'S 
PENTHOUSE...

326
00:10:53,277 --> 00:10:54,611
- COME RIGHT IN.

327
00:10:54,611 --> 00:10:58,741
narrator: LUCILLE HAD PUT THEM 
TO WORK ON A PROJECT OF HER OWN.

328
00:10:58,741 --> 00:10:59,867
- WHAT'D YOU DO?

329
00:10:59,867 --> 00:11:02,703
- WELL, I SAT ON ONE 
OF THESE JETS.

330
00:11:02,703 --> 00:11:04,664
BUT I THINK WE CAN FIX IT.

331
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:06,957
- DON'T GIVE ME THAT LOOK.

332
00:11:06,957 --> 00:11:10,335
I MOVED THE WALL A COUPLE 
OF INCHES INTO HER PENTHOUSE.

333
00:11:10,335 --> 00:11:12,421
DON'T THINK SHE'S NOT 
OVER THERE RIGHT NOW,

334
00:11:12,421 --> 00:11:14,006
PLOTTING HER REVENGE.

335
00:11:16,675 --> 00:11:20,095
- GOD, THE NEW EQUILIBRIUM 
REALLY DOES--

336
00:11:20,095 --> 00:11:22,472
IT MAKES THE ROOM 
SEEM TIGHTER.

337
00:11:24,767 --> 00:11:26,560
- SHE'S ALWAYS A STEP 
AHEAD OF ME.

338
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,687
- THAT'S WHAT MAKES HER 
SUCH A WORTHY OPPONENT.

339
00:11:28,687 --> 00:11:29,730
- HOW'D YOU PAY FOR IT?

340
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:31,065
- I CASHED IN SOME STOCK.

341
00:11:31,065 --> 00:11:32,566
YOU KNOW IT WAS UNFROZEN.

342
00:11:32,566 --> 00:11:33,776
I KNOW. 
I SENT YOU THAT LETTER.

343
00:11:33,776 --> 00:11:36,070
IT SAYS NOT TO SELL, 
OR WE'RE GONNA LOSE CONTROL.

344
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:37,321
- IT DOES?

345
00:11:37,321 --> 00:11:39,031
I STOPPED AT "UNFROZEN."

346
00:11:40,741 --> 00:11:42,701
- LINDSAY, YOU DIDN'T CASH IN 
YOUR STOCK, DID YOU?

347
00:11:42,701 --> 00:11:44,286
TELL ME YOU DIDN'T. 
- I DIDN'T.

348
00:11:44,286 --> 00:11:45,287
narrator: YET.

349
00:11:45,287 --> 00:11:46,580
- THERE'S A PRETTY LONG 
WAIT LIST

350
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:48,373
FOR MEMBERSHIP RIGHT NOW.

351
00:11:48,373 --> 00:11:50,542
- GOB, YOU DIDN'T SELL, 
DID YOU?

352
00:11:50,542 --> 00:11:52,419
- WHAT? 
NO.

353
00:11:52,419 --> 00:11:53,963
I'M TRYING TO GET A JOB 
FROM YOU, MIKEY.

354
00:11:53,963 --> 00:11:55,214
COME ON.

355
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:56,673
- OKAY, AS LONG AS YOU TWO 
DIDN'T SELL,

356
00:11:56,673 --> 00:11:57,674
I THINK WE SHOULD BE OKAY.

357
00:11:57,674 --> 00:11:58,675
- I WAS AFRAID THAT I--

358
00:11:58,675 --> 00:12:00,385
- I JUST BOUGHT THE QUEEN MARY.

359
00:12:00,385 --> 00:12:01,386
- YOU'RE KIDDING.

360
00:12:01,386 --> 00:12:02,429
I WAS JUST GONNA GET A YACHT.

361
00:12:02,429 --> 00:12:04,431
- NO, NO, NO. 
THE CLUB.

362
00:12:04,431 --> 00:12:07,101
I WAS DANCING WITH WHAT TURNED 
OUT TO BE THE CLUB'S OWNER,

363
00:12:07,101 --> 00:12:08,685
AND HE WAS LOOKING TO SELL.

364
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:12,940
OH, HE REALLY, REALLY 
DID LOOK LIKE A WOMAN.

365
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:14,191
BUT ANYHOO, CAN YOU BELIEVE

366
00:12:14,191 --> 00:12:15,901
THAT THE ONLY REASON 
THE CLUB IS GOING UNDER

367
00:12:15,901 --> 00:12:18,695
IS BECAUSE IT'S IN 
A TERRIFYING NEIGHBORHOOD?

368
00:12:18,695 --> 00:12:19,696
- THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE.

369
00:12:19,696 --> 00:12:21,740
- TOBIAS, I PROMISED THAT MONEY 
TO THE COUNTRY CLUB.

370
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:22,950
- COUNTRY CLUB?

371
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:24,994
- IT'S IN SUCH 
A GOOD NEIGHBORHOOD.

372
00:12:24,994 --> 00:12:25,995
- I DON'T BELIEVE THIS.

373
00:12:25,995 --> 00:12:27,287
DID YOU GUYS 
NOT READ THE LETTER?

374
00:12:27,287 --> 00:12:29,999
narrator: NONE OF THEM HAD READ 
PAST THE WORD "UNFROZEN."

375
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:31,876
- I HOPE YOU'RE ALL 
PROUD OF YOURSELVES.

376
00:12:31,876 --> 00:12:33,668
YOUR CARELESS, 
SELFISH SPENDING SPREES

377
00:12:33,668 --> 00:12:35,754
MAY HAVE COST US 
THE BLUTH COMPANY.

378
00:12:35,754 --> 00:12:37,589
- HEY, DAD, IS THAT 
YOUR NEW CAR IN THE DRIVEWAY?

379
00:12:37,589 --> 00:12:39,133
I CAN'T BELIEVE 
YOU GOT A CORVETTE!

380
00:12:41,135 --> 00:12:42,552
- IT'S A COMPANY CAR.

381
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:49,894
narrator: 
MICHAEL HAD BOUGHT A CAR,

382
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:51,686
AND IT HAD HELPED 
PUT THE COMPANY IN JEOPARDY.

383
00:12:51,686 --> 00:12:53,022
- I'M SORRY ABOUT THE PATCH.

384
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:56,525
I'M TESTIFYING AGAINST 
THE KINGS THIS AFTERNOON.

385
00:12:56,525 --> 00:12:57,943
YOU CAN'T SEE IT.

386
00:12:57,943 --> 00:12:59,028
I JUST WINKED.

387
00:13:00,362 --> 00:13:04,074
SO BASICALLY, YOU'RE ABOUT 
2,000 SHARES SHORT

388
00:13:04,074 --> 00:13:05,868
OF BEING 
THE MAJORITY STOCKHOLDERS.

389
00:13:05,868 --> 00:13:08,287
NOW, UNFORTUNATELY, 
IT'S A PRIVATE STOCK,

390
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:10,831
SO YOU CANNOT JUST BUY UP 
THE SHARES

391
00:13:10,831 --> 00:13:12,207
UNLESS SOMEONE 
IS WILLING TO SELL.

392
00:13:12,207 --> 00:13:13,208
- ARE YOU SURE?

393
00:13:13,208 --> 00:13:15,002
- THAT'S WHAT THEY SAID 
ON ASK JEEVES.

394
00:13:15,002 --> 00:13:16,962
- ALL RIGHT, WHO'S 
THE MAJORITY SHAREHOLDER NOW?

395
00:13:16,962 --> 00:13:18,630
- A COMPANY CALLED STANDPOOR.

396
00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:19,882
- STANDPOOR?

397
00:13:19,882 --> 00:13:23,052
- AS IN THE OPPOSITE OF SITWELL,

398
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:25,345
WHICH IS RUN BY 
A CERTAIN HAIRLESS MAN

399
00:13:25,345 --> 00:13:27,639
WHO COULD BE VERY UPSET WITH YOU 
RIGHT NOW.

400
00:13:27,639 --> 00:13:29,934
- WHAT WOULD HE HAVE TO BE UPSET 
WITH ME ABOUT?

401
00:13:29,934 --> 00:13:31,936
- YOU'RE WEARING HIS EYEBROWS?

402
00:13:31,936 --> 00:13:33,728
- THEY MAKE ME FEEL DRESSIER.

403
00:13:33,728 --> 00:13:35,814
[telephone rings]

404
00:13:35,814 --> 00:13:37,357
- HELLO? 
- IS IT TRUE, MICHAEL?

405
00:13:37,357 --> 00:13:38,692
DID WE LOSE THE COMPANY?

406
00:13:38,692 --> 00:13:39,693
- KIND OF.

407
00:13:39,693 --> 00:13:41,820
TO SOMETHING CALLED 
STANDPOOR.

408
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:42,947
YEAH, IT'S SITWELL.

409
00:13:42,947 --> 00:13:46,491
- IT'S LUCILLE AUSTERO. 
- LUCILLE 2?

410
00:13:46,491 --> 00:13:50,120
- STANDPOOR, BECAUSE SHE CAN'T 
STAND UP WITHOUT FALLING OVER.

411
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,872
I DON'T KNOW WHY SHE'D HAVE 
ANY TROUBLE.

412
00:13:51,872 --> 00:13:53,790
A PIANO COULD STAND 
ON THOSE LEGS.

413
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:56,501
SHE'S TRYING TO GET EVEN WITH ME 
FOR THE REMODELING.

414
00:13:56,501 --> 00:13:59,880
- I THINK WE'RE GONNA NEED 
A NEW FLOATING THERMOMETER.

415
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:02,466
COULD I HAVE YOUR-- 
YOUR BLUE CROSS NUMBER?

416
00:14:02,466 --> 00:14:04,384
- WELL, LET'S THINK ABOUT THIS, 
MOM.

417
00:14:04,384 --> 00:14:06,803
I MEAN, MAYBE THERE'S A WAY 
THAT WE CAN REASON WITH HER.

418
00:14:06,803 --> 00:14:09,098
- GIVE HER BUSTER. 
- WHAT?

419
00:14:09,098 --> 00:14:12,226
- WE NEED OUR COMPANY BACK. 
- MOM, THAT'S HORRIBLE.

420
00:14:12,226 --> 00:14:13,685
- I DON'T SUPPOSE 
YOU'VE SPENT MONEY

421
00:14:13,685 --> 00:14:14,853
ON SOMETHING YOU CAN RETURN?

422
00:14:14,853 --> 00:14:17,731
- LET'S GIVE HER BUSTER.

423
00:14:18,983 --> 00:14:20,609
- STARLA, DO YOU KNOW 
WHERE MY BROTHER IS?

424
00:14:20,609 --> 00:14:22,736
- YES, HE'S ON CLOUD NINE.

425
00:14:22,736 --> 00:14:23,737
THAT WAS ME, MICHAEL.

426
00:14:23,737 --> 00:14:25,822
- WHAT'S GOING ON? 
WHERE'S STARLA?

427
00:14:25,822 --> 00:14:27,908
- OH, SHE'S SAYING GOOD-BYE 
TO SOMEONE NAMED Q.

428
00:14:27,908 --> 00:14:29,952
IF SHE CAN GET PAST 
HIS SECURITY SYSTEM,

429
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:32,204
SHE'S GONNA TELL HIM IT'S OVER.

430
00:14:32,204 --> 00:14:33,205
SHE'S AMAZING.

431
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:34,206
[laughs]

432
00:14:34,206 --> 00:14:38,502
WE COMPLETELY CONNECTED, 
AND IT'S ALL BECAUSE OF YOU.

433
00:14:38,502 --> 00:14:40,337
YOU MADE THIS HAPPEN.

434
00:14:41,171 --> 00:14:43,173
I FEEL ALIVE!

435
00:14:43,173 --> 00:14:46,718
narrator: INDEED, STARLA AND 
BUSTER DID HIT IT OFF WELL,

436
00:14:46,718 --> 00:14:48,929
BUSTER BEING A SWEETER, 
MORE SUPPORTIVE MAN

437
00:14:48,929 --> 00:14:50,430
THAN SHE WAS USED TO,

438
00:14:50,430 --> 00:14:53,308
AND STARLA BEING A WOMAN 
THAT WASN'T 70.

439
00:14:53,308 --> 00:14:57,312
- I'M JUST WONDERING 
IF YOU DIDN'T UPGRADE

440
00:14:57,312 --> 00:14:58,855
A LITTLE TOO FAST.

441
00:14:58,855 --> 00:15:00,440
YOU KNOW, 
YOU WANT SOMETHING SENSIBLE,

442
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:02,943
YOU END UP GETTING 
PUSHED INTO SOMETHING FLASHY.

443
00:15:02,943 --> 00:15:04,861
- [whispering] 
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

444
00:15:04,861 --> 00:15:07,281
- DON'T YOU THINK 
YOU BELONG IN A LUCILLE?

445
00:15:08,657 --> 00:15:10,409
[stairs rattling]

446
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:14,454
narrator: MAEBY, MEANWHILE,

447
00:15:14,454 --> 00:15:16,790
GAVE READING HER SCRIPT 
ANOTHER SHOT,

448
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:19,376
ONLY TO DISCOVER 
HER WORK WAS DONE.

449
00:15:19,376 --> 00:15:21,628
HER SCRIPTS HAD BEEN NOTED.

450
00:15:21,628 --> 00:15:24,048
SO SHE WENT TO FIND THE PERSON 
SHE THOUGHT WAS RESPONSIBLE.

451
00:15:24,048 --> 00:15:26,341
- GEORGE MICHAEL, 
I READ YOUR NOTES.

452
00:15:26,341 --> 00:15:28,427
- WHAT?

453
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:30,345
YOU-- 
OH, YOU FOUND THE--

454
00:15:30,345 --> 00:15:31,888
WELL, LOOK, I DON'T-- 
THAT WAS A LONG--

455
00:15:31,888 --> 00:15:33,182
- THEY WERE GREAT.

456
00:15:33,182 --> 00:15:35,142
I MEAN, THEY SAID SO MANY THINGS 
I WANTED TO SAY,

457
00:15:35,142 --> 00:15:36,977
BUT I DIDN'T KNOW HOW, 
YOU KNOW?

458
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:38,979
DON'T TELL ANYONE, OKAY?

459
00:15:38,979 --> 00:15:40,605
- NEVER.

460
00:15:45,277 --> 00:15:47,446
- I GUESS SHE DIDN'T 
SEE THE DRAWINGS.

461
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:49,990
narrator: MEANWHILE, TOBIAS 
PREPARED TO ASSUME OWNERSHIP

462
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:50,991
OF THE QUEEN MARY.

463
00:15:50,991 --> 00:15:54,536
- IT'S SUPPOSED TO SAY 
"TOBIAS'S QUEEN MARY."

464
00:15:54,536 --> 00:15:57,706
NO, THAT IS NOT WHAT IT SAYS. 
I DISTINCT--

465
00:15:57,706 --> 00:15:59,916
HELLO?

466
00:15:59,916 --> 00:16:02,336
WELL, I SUPPOSE I COULD JUST 
PAINT OVER "MARY."

467
00:16:02,336 --> 00:16:09,218
- DON'T BOTHER, MAN. 
THIS IS OUR CLUB NOW.

468
00:16:09,218 --> 00:16:11,971
narrator: TOBIAS DIDN'T WANT TO 
SELL HIS NEW CLUB,

469
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:13,680
BUT LINDSAY DID.

470
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,599
WHICH IS WHY SHE HIRED 
SEVERAL MEMBERS

471
00:16:15,599 --> 00:16:18,810
OF A LOCAL STRIPPER AGENCY, 
CALLED THE HOT COPS,

472
00:16:18,810 --> 00:16:20,645
TO POSE AS THE ROUGHNECKS.

473
00:16:20,645 --> 00:16:21,646
- ALL RIGHT, FELLAS, LOOK.

474
00:16:21,646 --> 00:16:24,024
I KNOW YOU KNOW NOTHING 
BUT A LIFE ON THE STREET,

475
00:16:24,024 --> 00:16:25,400
BUT I'D LIKE TO 
OFFER YOU SOMETHING

476
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:26,901
THAT THE QUEEN MARY GAVE ME:

477
00:16:26,901 --> 00:16:28,087
THE JOY OF THE STAGE.

478
00:16:28,087 --> 00:16:31,991
SO MAYBE YOU COULD, UH, 
START JETE-ING

479
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:35,577
AND STOP "JE-TERRORIZING" ME.

480
00:16:35,577 --> 00:16:38,497
- YEAH! 
- ABSOLUTELY!

481
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:39,456
- WE COULD DO "RENT."

482
00:16:39,456 --> 00:16:41,291
- WELL, THIS IS JOYOUS NEWS.

483
00:16:41,291 --> 00:16:44,294
narrator: AND BUSTER, 
NOW CONVINCED THAT LUCILLE 2

484
00:16:44,294 --> 00:16:47,172
WAS THE RIGHT WOMAN FOR HIM, 
BROKE UP WITH STARLA.

485
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:51,551
- YOU OKAY?

486
00:16:51,551 --> 00:16:53,970
- IT WAS FOR THE BEST ANYWAY.

487
00:16:53,970 --> 00:16:56,098
A GIRL LIKE THAT DESERVES 
TO BE TAKEN CARE OF,

488
00:16:56,098 --> 00:16:59,059
AND I'M JUST A POOR SOLDIER.

489
00:16:59,059 --> 00:17:00,685
- YOU DIDN'T SELL YOUR STOCK?

490
00:17:00,685 --> 00:17:03,063
- WHAT? 
NO.

491
00:17:03,063 --> 00:17:04,356
YOUR LETTER SAID NOT TO,

492
00:17:04,356 --> 00:17:05,982
AND I WOULD NEVER 
WANT TO HURT THE FAMILY.

493
00:17:05,982 --> 00:17:08,527
narrator: AND MICHAEL REALIZED 
HIS LITTLE BROTHER

494
00:17:08,527 --> 00:17:10,737
DESERVED HAPPINESS 
MORE THAN ANYONE.

495
00:17:10,737 --> 00:17:13,907
YOU KNOW, I WANT YOU 
TO FORGET ABOUT WHAT I SAID.

496
00:17:13,907 --> 00:17:15,659
I WAS WRONG. 
YOU TWO BELONG TOGETHER.

497
00:17:15,659 --> 00:17:18,120
I'LL TAKE CARE 
OF LUCILLE 2 FOR YOU.

498
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:19,913
- REALLY? 
- YEAH.

499
00:17:19,913 --> 00:17:21,456
- LET HER DOWN EASY.

500
00:17:21,456 --> 00:17:23,208
THAT RIGHT KNEE 
COULD GO AT ANY TIME.

501
00:17:24,459 --> 00:17:25,960
STARLA!

502
00:17:27,003 --> 00:17:29,714
narrator: AND AT THE 
"TOBIAS IS QUEEN MARY,"

503
00:17:29,714 --> 00:17:32,592
TOBIAS COULDN'T BELIEVE HOW 
QUICKLY HE HAD GOTTEN THROUGH

504
00:17:32,592 --> 00:17:36,721
TO HIS RAGTAG GANG 
OF NEIGHBORHOOD TOUGHS.

505
00:17:36,721 --> 00:17:37,889
- WOW.

506
00:17:37,889 --> 00:17:40,100
YOU REALLY HAVE MADE 
SOME AMAZING STRIDES

507
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:41,310
IN A HALF AN HOUR.

508
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:43,520
WE HAVE TO TAKE THIS 
TO THE STREETS.

509
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,522
WE HAVE TO STRUT!

510
00:17:46,148 --> 00:17:47,857
narrator: MICHAEL KNEW 
IF HE HAD ANY CHANCE

511
00:17:47,857 --> 00:17:50,277
OF GETTING CONTROL 
OF THE COMPANY AGAIN,

512
00:17:50,277 --> 00:17:52,737
HE WOULD NEED TO CHARM 
LUCILLE 2.

513
00:17:52,737 --> 00:17:55,074
- YOUR HAIR. 
- CAN I TAKE YOU FOR A SPIN?

514
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:57,701
narrator: BUT THE SPIN 
IN MICHAEL'S NEW CAR

515
00:17:57,701 --> 00:17:59,661
RETRIGGERED HER VERTIGO.

516
00:17:59,661 --> 00:18:01,080
THAT NIGHT, TOBIAS'S PLAN

517
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,748
TO CHANGE THE STREETS 
WITH HIS GANG

518
00:18:03,748 --> 00:18:06,251
ALSO TURNED OUT 
TO BE ILL-CONCEIVED.

519
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:09,796
- HEY, "FEZELLAS," LOOKS LIKE 
YOU GUYS ARE UP TO NO GOOD.

520
00:18:09,796 --> 00:18:12,757
WELL, THIS GANG USED TO BE 
LIKE THAT TOO,

521
00:18:12,757 --> 00:18:14,509
THREE, FOUR!

522
00:18:14,509 --> 00:18:15,760
[rapping] 
SO YOU THINK YOU'RE TOUGH

523
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,096
WELL, WE HATE RAPPIN'

524
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:19,639
BUT DON'T BUST A CAP IN 
'CAUSE HERE'S WHAT'S HAPPENIN'

525
00:18:19,639 --> 00:18:23,059
WE'RE BREAKIN' OUT 
SOME OLD-FASHIONED TAPPIN'

526
00:18:23,059 --> 00:18:24,436
[all singing] 
HEY BLOODS AND CRIPS

527
00:18:24,436 --> 00:18:25,645
THERE'S A NEW GANG IN TOWN

528
00:18:25,645 --> 00:18:27,147
- OH, I'VE BEEN SHOT!

529
00:18:27,147 --> 00:18:29,316
- WE MISCALCULATED! 
RETREAT!

530
00:18:29,316 --> 00:18:30,359
- QUICK, SWITCH TO FOLLIES!

531
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:32,444
- THAT'S NOT GONNA HELP!

532
00:18:32,444 --> 00:18:35,071
narrator: MEANWHILE, 
MICHAEL AND LUCILLE 2 ARRIVED

533
00:18:35,071 --> 00:18:37,782
TO FIND THE CLUB NEARLY EMPTY,

534
00:18:37,782 --> 00:18:41,161
ALTHOUGH MICHAEL 
WOULD HAVE FIT IN PERFECTLY.

535
00:18:41,161 --> 00:18:42,912
- IT'S PROBABLY-- 
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT, LUCILLE.

536
00:18:42,912 --> 00:18:44,206
I'M GONNA TAKE YOU 
DANCING, HUH?

537
00:18:44,206 --> 00:18:45,499
- NO, MICHAEL, PLEASE.

538
00:18:45,499 --> 00:18:48,835
YOU HAVE UNDONE ALL OF 
DR. SANDOR PLUMB'S WORK.

539
00:18:48,835 --> 00:18:50,170
- OH, I'M SORRY.

540
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:51,921
LOOK, THE REASON 
THAT I SHOWED UP TONIGHT

541
00:18:51,921 --> 00:18:55,008
WAS BECAUSE I DON'T THINK 
THAT IT'S RIGHT

542
00:18:55,008 --> 00:18:56,718
FOR YOU TO BE DATING MY BROTHER.

543
00:18:56,718 --> 00:18:59,763
I MEAN, HE'S MET SOMEONE ELSE, 
AND, FRANKLY,

544
00:18:59,763 --> 00:19:01,723
THE ONLY REASON THAT 
HE ASKED YOU OUT TONIGHT

545
00:19:01,723 --> 00:19:04,434
WAS BECAUSE I WANTED HIM TO GET 
THE STOCK BACK FROM YOU

546
00:19:04,434 --> 00:19:08,062
SO THAT I COULD REGAIN 
CONTROL OF THE COMPANY.

547
00:19:08,062 --> 00:19:11,608
BUT I WOULD-- 
I'D RATHER HAVE MY BROTHER BACK.

548
00:19:11,608 --> 00:19:14,319
SO, I'M SORRY.

549
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:16,821
- I UNDERSTAND. 
- THANK YOU.

550
00:19:16,821 --> 00:19:21,075
AND I DO NOT BLAME YOU FOR 
NOT LIKING THE BLUTHS ANYMORE.

551
00:19:21,075 --> 00:19:23,262
- LIKE THE BLUTHS? 
I LOVE THE BLUTHS.

552
00:19:23,262 --> 00:19:26,456
- WHY DID YOU BUY UP 
ALL OF OUR COMPANY STOCK?

553
00:19:26,456 --> 00:19:28,124
- TO SUPPORT YOU GUYS.

554
00:19:28,124 --> 00:19:30,752
I HAVE ALWAYS HAD 
A STANDING ORDER

555
00:19:30,752 --> 00:19:33,922
TO BUY UP 
ANY AVAILABLE BLUTH STOCK.

556
00:19:33,922 --> 00:19:36,007
- YOU DO KNOW THAT WE'RE ABOUT 
2,000 SHARES SHORT

557
00:19:36,007 --> 00:19:37,592
OF CONTROLLING THE COMPANY NOW, 
THOUGH.

558
00:19:37,592 --> 00:19:39,594
- WELL, YOU COULD HAVE 
SOME OF MINE.

559
00:19:39,594 --> 00:19:40,929
REALLY? 
WOULD YOU DO THAT?

560
00:19:40,929 --> 00:19:41,930
- YEAH, OF COURSE.

561
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:43,807
- WELL, THAT'S-- 
THANK YOU.

562
00:19:43,807 --> 00:19:45,600
- ACTUALLY, 
THERE IS A CONDITION.

563
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,894
- ANYTHING. 
- CALL ME A CAB.

564
00:19:47,894 --> 00:19:51,231
- AH, BECAUSE OF MY DRIVING. 
YES.

565
00:19:51,231 --> 00:19:52,482
narrator: 
AND SO THE NEXT DAY,

566
00:19:52,482 --> 00:19:55,444
MICHAEL WAS THRILLED TO HAVE 
CONTROL OF THE COMPANY BACK.

567
00:19:55,444 --> 00:19:57,862
- I FIXED EVERYTHING. 
- OH?

568
00:19:57,862 --> 00:19:59,198
- WITH THE BUSINESS.

569
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:01,283
IT'S ALL TAKEN CARE OF.

570
00:20:01,283 --> 00:20:03,618
- YOU DIDN'T THINK I COULD, 
BUT I DID.

571
00:20:03,618 --> 00:20:04,994
- GOB, WHAT'D YOU DO?

572
00:20:04,994 --> 00:20:07,497
narrator: GOB HAD 
RUN INTO LUCILLE 2

573
00:20:07,497 --> 00:20:09,040
SHORTLY AFTER MICHAEL 
DROPPED HER OFF.

574
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:11,335
MY MOM REALLY TOOK UP 
A BUNCH OF YOUR SPACE, HUH?

575
00:20:11,335 --> 00:20:12,544
WHAT A BITCH.

576
00:20:12,544 --> 00:20:14,003
- WHAT--WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

577
00:20:14,003 --> 00:20:17,216
- WHEN SHE EXPANDED HER BATHROOM 
AND MOVED YOUR WALL OVER.

578
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:20,510
THAT'S WHY ALL YOUR STUFF'S 
STICKING OUT.

579
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:22,262
- OH.

580
00:20:22,262 --> 00:20:25,974
YOUR MOTHER REALLY HAS A WAY 
OF GETTING MY GOAT.

581
00:20:25,974 --> 00:20:27,767
[laughter]

582
00:20:27,767 --> 00:20:29,853
narrator: 
SO GOB [bleep] LUCILLE 2.

583
00:20:29,853 --> 00:20:30,854
- YOU WHAT?

584
00:20:30,854 --> 00:20:33,773
- OH, AND SHE'S NOT GONNA 
GIVE THE SHARES BACK NOW.

585
00:20:33,773 --> 00:20:35,149
YOU JUST SAID THAT 
YOU FIXED EVERYTHING.

586
00:20:35,149 --> 00:20:37,151
- OH, I MEANT MY PROBLEMS.

587
00:20:37,151 --> 00:20:40,339
YEAH, SHE'S GONNA MAKE ME 
THE NEW PRESIDENT.

588
00:20:40,339 --> 00:20:45,076
BUT YOU DON'T NEED TO PROVE 
YOURSELF TO ME, LITTLE BROTHER.

589
00:20:45,076 --> 00:20:47,161
YOU WILL ALWAYS 
HAVE A JOB HERE.

590
00:20:48,872 --> 00:20:50,349
BUT I DO NEED THE KEYS 
TO THE COMPANY CAR.

591
00:20:53,502 --> 00:20:56,588
narrator: ON THE NEXT 
"ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT,"

592
00:20:56,588 --> 00:21:01,510
LUCILLE 2 RECLAIMS 
SOME SPACE.

593
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:04,304
THE QUEEN MARY 
CHANGES HANDS ONCE AGAIN.

594
00:21:04,304 --> 00:21:06,097
- I-I'VE WANTED 
A SMALL FAMILY RESTAURANT

595
00:21:06,097 --> 00:21:08,558
SINCE I GOT 
THE KINGS SETTLEMENT.

596
00:21:08,558 --> 00:21:10,935
IT STILL HAS 
THE DUNGEON AREA, RIGHT?

597
00:21:10,935 --> 00:21:12,646
narrator: 
AND GOB GETS NEEDY.

598
00:21:13,229 --> 00:21:14,314
- OH.

599
00:21:14,314 --> 00:21:15,857
- LET'S GO FOR IT.
