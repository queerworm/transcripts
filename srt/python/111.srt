184

we witnessed the resuscitation
of a great footballing
tradition

185
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:21,920
when Jarrow United came of age
in a European sense

186
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,800
with an almost Proustian
display

of modern existentialist
football,

188

by midfield moral argument,

<i>catenaccio</i> defensive

intellectually out-argued

thrusting and bursting

Kantian positivism.

in this fine Jarrow team
was my man of the match,
