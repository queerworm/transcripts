Poor fellow.
I think he needs help.

00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,400
Right, cut
the wisecracks, vicar.

177
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:20,720
Get in the search room
and strip.

178
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:23,760
Well, to discuss
the implications
of that sketch,

179
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,440
and to consider
the moral problems

180
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:28,360
raised by the law-enforcement
methods involved,

181
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:30,880
we have a duck,
a cat and a lizard.

182
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:32,560
Now, first of all,

183
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,520
I'd like to put this question
to you please, lizard.

184
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:38,240
How effective do you consider
the legal weapons

185
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:41,640
employed by legal Customs
officers nowadays?

186
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:47,480
Oh, while you're thinking
about that, heh,

187
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:50,080
I'd like to bring the duck
in here and ask her,
if possible,

188
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:52,520
to clarify the whole question
of currency restrictions

189
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:56,120
and Custom regulations
in the world today.

190
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,880
Heh. Perhaps the cat
would rather answer that?

191
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:04,160
No? Lizard?

192
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,640
No. Ahem.

193
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:10,000
Well, um...

00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:13,160

man in the street
what he thinks.

195
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:16,520
I am not a man,
you silly-billy.

196
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:22,080
I'm not in the street,
you fairy.

197
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:24,720
Well, uh, speaking
as a man in the street--

198
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:25,680
Whaa!

199
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:29,120

carrying more than
200 cigarettes.

206
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:55,600
Well, I-I think that, uh,
nobody who has gone abroad

207

back in the country.

the establishment to survive

uh, first with bombs and
rockets, destroying their homes,

293
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:45,000
and then when they
run helpless into the streets,

294
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:47,360
uh, mowing them down
