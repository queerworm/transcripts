You're on the summarizing spot,
15 seconds from... now.

30
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,760
Proust's novel ostensibly tells
of the irrevocability
of time lost,

31
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,200
the forfeiture of innocence
through experience,

32
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:18,440
the reinstallment of
extra-temporal values
of time regained.

33
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,480
Ultimately, the novel
is both optimistic

34
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:23,640
and set within the context of
a humane religious experience,

35
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:26,240

the concept of intemporality.

00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:19,640

This week, I'm going
to tell you what to do

00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:29,040
if there is an armed communist
uprising near your home

321
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:31,200
when you're having a party.

322
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:33,600

it'll depend how far
you've got with your party

for Red Revolt is raised.

If you're just having

or a sparkling white wine,

326
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:43,240
then your guests will obviously
be in a fairly formal mood

327
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:46,360
and it will be difficult to tell
which are
the communist agitators.

328
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:50,280
So, the thing to do
is to get some cloth
and some bits of old paper,

put it down on the floor
and shoot everybody.

If you're having canapes,
as I showed you last week,
or an outdoor barbecue,

332
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:04,600
then the thing to do
is to set fire to all
the houses in the street.

333
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,680
