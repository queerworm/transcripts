-No, you came here

definite proposition.

-Yes, it is.
-No, it isn't.

Argument's an intellectual
process.

479
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:49,240

-No, I wanna complain about--
-If you complain,
nothing happens.

518
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:17,880
You might just as well
not bother. My back hurts and...

519
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:20,160
-I want to com-- Ow!
-No, no, no.

520
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:22,400
Hold your head like this,
and then go:

521
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:23,640
Whaa!

522
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:25,040
-Try it again.
-Ohhhh!

523
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:27,040
Better, better,
but "Whaa! Whaa!"

524
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:28,680
-Hold your hands here.
-No!

525
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,560
-Now. Look, that's it.
That's it!
-Whaaa!

526
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:31,960
-Good.
-Stop hitting me!

527
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,040
-What?
-Stop hitting me.

528
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:35,320
-Stop hitting you?
-Yes.

529
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:36,800
What did you come
in here for?

530
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:38,160
I came here to complain.

531
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:39,640
Oh, I'm sorry,
that's next door.

532
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:41,880
It's being-hit-on-the-head
lessons in here.

533
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:43,640
What a stupid concept.

534
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:44,800
Right, hold it, there.

535
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:45,880
-What?
-What?

536
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:47,680
Allow me to introduce myself.

537
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:49,720
I'm Inspector Fox of the
Light Entertainment Police

538
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:51,920
Comedy Division,
Special Flying Squad.

539
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:53,760
-Flying Fox of the Yard?
-Flying Fox of the Yard?

540
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:54,880
-Shut up!
-Ow!

541
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:56,400
No, no, no.
"Whaaa!"

542
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:58,600
-And you!
-Whaaa!

543
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:01,360
He's good. You could learn
a thing or two from him.

544
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:04,120
Right, now, you two, me old
beauties, you are nicked.

545
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:07,120
-What for?
-I'm charging you
under Section 21

546
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:09,440
of the Strange Sketch Act.

547
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:11,240
-The what?
-You are hereby charged

548
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:13,720
that you did willfully
take part in a strange sketch.

549
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:16,240
That is, a skit, spoof or
humorous vignette

550
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:17,840
of an unconventional nature

551
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:19,800
with intent to cause grievous
mental confusion

552
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:21,480
to the Great British public.

553
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:23,080
Evening, all.

554
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:24,440
It's a fair cop.

555
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,440
-And you tosh.
-Whaaa!

556
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:28,640
That's excellent!
Right, come on down the Yard.

557
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:31,960
Hold it. Hold it.
Allow me to introduce myself.

558
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,880
I'm Inspector Thompson's
Gazelle of the Program
Planning Police,

559
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:37,400
Light Entertainment Division,
Special Flying Squad.

560
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:39,280
Flying Thompson's
Gazelle of the Yard?

561
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:40,680
-Shut up!
-Gahh!

562
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:42,400
-He's good.
-Shut up!

563
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:44,080
-Whaa!
-Rotten.

564
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:45,240
Ahhh!

565
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:46,920
Good!

566
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:50,240
Right, I'm arresting this entire
show on three counts:

567
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:52,920
One, acts of
self-conscious behavior,

568
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:55,160
contrary to the
Not-In-Front-of-the-Children
Act.

569
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:58,040
Two, always saying,
"It's so-and-so of the Yard,"

570
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,800
every time the fuzz arrives.

571
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:02,280
And, three...
And this is the cruncher.

572
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:04,240
...offenses against
the Getting-Out-of-Sketches

573
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:06,840
Without-Using-a-Proper-Punchline
Act.

574
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:09,400
Namely, simply ending
every bleeding sketch,

575
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:12,360
by just having
a policeman come in and--

576
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,800
Wait a minute.

577
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:17,960
-Hold it.
-It's a fair cop.

578
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:23,040
<i>And now on BBC 1,</i>

579
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:25,080
<i>one more minute of</i>
Monty Python's Flying Circus.
