<i>to Hurlingham Park.</i>

338
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:45,080
<i>You join us</i>
<i>just as the competitors</i>

339
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,600
<i>are running out onto the field</i>

340
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:48,520
<i>on this lovely winter's</i>
<i>afternoon here</i>

341
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:52,280
<i>with the going firm underfoot</i>
<i>and very little sign of rain.</i>

342
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,400
<i>Well, it certainly looks</i>
<i>as though</i>

343
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:57,000
<i>we're in for a splendid</i>
<i>afternoon's sport in this,</i>

344
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:01,040
<i>the 127th Upper-class</i>
<i>Twit of the Year Show.</i>

345
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:02,960
<i>Now, the competitors</i>
<i>will be off any moment</i>

346
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,560
<i>so let me just identify them</i>
<i>for you.</i>

347
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:09,480
<i>Vivian Smith-Smythe-Smith</i>
<i>has O-level in chemo-hygiene.</i>

348
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:11,720
<i>Simon-Zinc-Trumpet-Harris</i>

349
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:13,720
<i>married to a very attractive</i>
<i>table lamp.</i>

350
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:16,000
<i>Nigel Incubator-Jones'</i>
<i>best friend is a tree,</i>

351
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:18,240
<i>and in his spare time,</i>
<i>he's a stockbroker.</i>

352
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:20,600
<i>Gervaise Brook-Hampster</i>
<i>is in the Guards</i>

353
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:23,000
<i>and his father uses him</i>
<i>as a wastepaper basket.</i>

354
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:25,880
<i>And finally,</i>
<i>Oliver St. John-Mollusc Harrow</i>
<i>and the Guards,</i>

355
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:30,120
<i>thought by many to be this</i>
<i>year's outstanding twit.</i>

356
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,080
<i>Now they're moving up</i>
<i>to the starting line.</i>

357
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:34,040
<i>There's a jolly good crowd</i>
<i>here today.</i>

358
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:36,760
<i>They're under</i>
<i>starter's orders.</i>

359
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:39,000
<i>And...</i>

360
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,000
<i>they're off!</i>

361
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,120
<i>Oh, no, they're not.</i>

362
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,720
<i>No, they didn't realize</i>
<i>they were supposed to start.</i>

363
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:49,200
<i>Never mind,</i>
<i>we'll soon sort that out.</i>

364
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:50,960
<i>The judge is explaining it</i>
<i>to them now.</i>

365
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,200
<i>I think Nigel and Gervaise</i>
<i>have got the idea.</i>

366
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,400
<i>All set to go.</i>

367
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,840
<i>Oh, and they're off!</i>

368
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,720
<i>And it's a fast start</i>
<i>this year.</i>

369
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:01,040
<i>Oliver St. John-Mollusc</i>
<i>running a bit wide there.</i>

370
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:04,680
<i>And now they're coming into</i>
<i>their first test:</i>
<i>the straight line.</i>

371
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:07,520
<i>They've got to walk along</i>
<i>this straight line</i>
<i>without falling over--</i>

372
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:09,400
<i>And Oliver's over</i>
<i>at the back there.</i>

373
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:12,000
<i>Simon's coming through</i>
<i>quite fast on the outside.</i>

374
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:14,400
<i>Simon and Nigel, both of them</i>
<i>coming through very fast.</i>

375
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:16,280
<i>There's Nigel, number three.</i>

376
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:18,520
<i>And there's Gervaise coming</i>
<i>through just out of shot.</i>

377
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:20,280
<i>And now, the positions.</i>

378
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:22,920
<i>Simon and Vivian at the front</i>
<i>coming into the matchbox jump.</i>

379
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:25,360
<i>Three layers of matchboxes</i>
<i>to clear.</i>

380
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:28,560
<i>And Simon's over.</i>
<i>And Vivian's over,</i>
<i>beautifully.</i>

381
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:30,000
<i>Oh, the jump of a lifetime!</i>

382
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:32,000
<i>If only his father</i>
<i>could understand.</i>

383
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:34,400
<i>Here's Nigel. He's confused--</i>
<i>No. And Gervaise is over.</i>

384
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:38,360
<i>No, he's, uh-- Nigel is over.</i>
<i>He's only just hit the top.</i>

385
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,920
<i>And now it's Gervaise.</i>
<i>Gervaise is going to jump it.</i>

386
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:43,000
<i>No, he's jumped the wrong way.</i>
<i>Well done, Gervaise.</i>

387
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:45,600
<i>There he goes.</i>
<i>Nigel's over, beautifully.</i>

388
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:48,080
<i>Now it's only Oliver.</i>
<i>Oliver and Gervaise--</i>

389
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:49,640
<i>Oh, bad luck.</i>

390
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:51,400
<i>And now it's Kicking</i>
<i>the Beggar.</i>

391
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:52,960
<i>Simon's there</i>
<i>and he's putting the boot in,</i>

392
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,920
<i>and not terribly hard</i>
<i>but he's down!</i>

393
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,640
<i>And he goes down,</i>
<i>so Simon can move on.</i>

394
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:58,440
<i>Now, Vivian's there.</i>

395
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:00,080
<i>Vivian is there</i>
<i>and waiting for a chance.</i>

396
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:02,000
<i>Here he comes. Oh!</i>
<i>The old pile driver.</i>

397
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:03,560
<i>A real pile driver.</i>

398
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,920
<i>And now, uh, Simon's</i>
<i>our number one,</i>

399
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,800
<i>Vivian two, Nigel three,</i>
<i>Gervaise in four,</i>

400
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:09,920
<i>and Oliver bringing up</i>
<i>the rear.</i>

401
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:12,360
<i>Uh, there's Oliver. There's</i>
<i>Oliver now. He's at the back.</i>

402
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,680
<i>I think he's having</i>
<i>a little trouble</i>

403
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,280
<i>with his old brain injury.</i>

404
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,640
<i>He's gonna have a go.</i>
<i>No, no. Bad luck.</i>

405
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:21,080
<i>But he's up. He doesn't know</i>
<i>when he's beaten, this boy.</i>

406
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,960
<i>He doesn't know</i>
<i>when he's winning, either.</i>

407
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,160
<i>He doesn't have any sort</i>
<i>of sensory apparatus there.</i>

408
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,320
<i>Outstanding. Outstanding--</i>
<i>Oh, my.</i>

409
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:30,760
<i>Oh, there's Gervaise,</i>
<i>putting the boot in there.</i>

410
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:33,400
<i>He's got the beggar down. The</i>
<i>steward's giving him advice.</i>

411
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:34,720
<i>Yes, he can move on, now.</i>

412
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:36,680
<i>He can move on</i>
<i>to the Hunt Photograph.</i>

413
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,320
<i>There's Ger-- I think he's</i>
<i>real-- Yes, he's off.</i>

414
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:40,160
<i>Gervaise is there and Oliver's</i>
<i>still at the back</i>

415
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:43,280
<i>having trouble</i>
<i>with the matchboxes.</i>

416
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:45,040
<i>Now, here's</i>
<i>the Hunt Ball Photograph</i>

417
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:46,960
<i>and the first here is Simon.</i>

418
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,520
<i>He's going to enjoy a joke</i>
<i>with Lady Arabella Plunkett.</i>

419
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:51,320
<i>She hopes to go into films.</i>

420
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:53,200
<i>And Vivian's through there,</i>
<i>and Nigel's there</i>

421
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:56,240
<i>enjoying a joke with Lady</i>
<i>Sarah Pencil Farthing Vivian</i>

422
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:57,760
<i>Steamroller Adams Thigh</i>
<i>Biscuit</i>

423
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:59,680
<i>Aftershave Gore</i>
<i>Stringbottom Smith.</i>

424
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:02,160
<i>And there's Simon, now,</i>
<i>in the sports car.</i>

425
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,600
<i>And he's reversing</i>
<i>into the old woman.</i>

426
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:05,320
<i>He caught her beautifully.</i>

427
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,120
<i>Now he's going to accelerate</i>
<i>forward, there,</i>

428
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:08,960
<i>to wake up the neighbor.</i>
<i>There's Vivian, I think.</i>

429
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,880
<i>No, Vivian's lost his keys.</i>
<i>No, there's Vivian.</i>

430
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:13,400
<i>He's got the woman, slowly but</i>
<i>surely, right in the midriff.</i>

431
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:16,280
<i>And here he is. Here he is</i>
<i>to wake up the neighbor now.</i>

432
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,560
<i>Simon, right in the lead,</i>
<i>comfortably in the lead,</i>

433
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:20,280
<i>but he can't get this neighbor</i>
<i>woken up.</i>

434
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:22,360
<i>He's slamming away there</i>
<i>as best he can.</i>

435
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,560
<i>He's getting absolutely</i>
<i>no reaction at all.</i>

436
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:28,120
<i>No-- There! There, he's woken</i>
<i>him up. And Simon's through.</i>

437
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,280
<i>Here comes Vivian.</i>
<i>Vivian to slam the door.</i>

438
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:32,920
<i>There we are, back at the</i>
<i>ball. I think that's Gervaise.</i>

439
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,640
<i>That's Gervaise</i>
<i>going through, there.</i>

440
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:37,400
<i>And here-- Here comes Oliver,</i>
<i>brave Oliver.</i>

441
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,360
<i>Is he gonna make it to the</i>
<i>table? No, I don't</i>
<i>think he is.</i>

442
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:42,080
<i>Yes, he is. Oh!</i>

443
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:43,680
[CHATTERING]

444
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:45,240
<i>And the crowd are rising</i>
<i>to him, there.</i>

445
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:47,040
<i>And there I can see--</i>
<i>Who is that there?</i>

446
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:48,920
<i>Yes, that's Nigel.</i>
<i>Nigel has woken the neighbor.</i>

447
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:51,800
<i>My God, this is exciting.</i>
<i>Nigel's very excited.</i>

448
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:54,120
<i>He's going through.</i>
<i>Here comes Gervaise.</i>

449
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:57,240
<i>Gervaise-- Oh, no, this is...</i>
<i>Out in the front there</i>
<i>is Simon</i>

450
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,240
<i>who's supposed to insult</i>
<i>the waiter and he's forgotten.</i>

451
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:02,680
<i>And Oliver</i>
<i>has run himself over!</i>

452
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,960
<i>What a great twit.</i>

453
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,160
<i>And there--</i>
<i>Now, here comes Vivian.</i>

454
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,520
<i>Vivian to insult the waiter,</i>
<i>and he is heaping abuse</i>
<i>on him.</i>

455
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:12,320
<i>He's just humiliating him,</i>
<i>there and he's gone</i>
<i>into the lead.</i>

456
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:14,720
<i>Simon's not with him.</i>
<i>No, Vivian's hit the bar.</i>

457
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:16,280
<i>Now, they've got to get</i>
<i>under this bar.</i>

458
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:18,000
<i>This is extremely difficult</i>
<i>as it requires</i>

459
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:20,840
<i>absolutely expert coordination</i>
<i>between mind and body.</i>

460
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:23,280
<i>Now, they need to get there.</i>
<i>Here we go again.</i>

461
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:25,520
<i>Simon's fallen backwards.</i>
<i>Here's Nigel, and he's</i>
<i>tripped.</i>

462
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:27,240
<i>Nigel has tripped</i>
<i>and he's under.</i>

463
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:28,840
<i>Simon fails again.</i>

464
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,600
<i>Uh, now here is Gervaise</i>
<i>coming through--</i>

465
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,600
<i>And Simon is through</i>
<i>by accident.</i>

466
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,960
<i>There's Gervaise, he's the</i>
<i>last one, but here we are.</i>

467
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,680
<i>Here's Nigel right at the head</i>
<i>of the field.</i>

468
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,320
<i>He's gotta shoot the rabbit.</i>

469
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:40,520
<i>These rabbits have been tied</i>
<i>to the ground,</i>

470
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:42,520
<i>but they tend to be frisky,</i>
<i>and this is only a one-day</i>
<i>event.</i>

471
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:44,040
<i>And they're blazing away</i>
<i>there.</i>

472
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:46,120
<i>They're not getting the</i>
<i>results they might.</i>

473
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:48,240
<i>Gervaise is in there,</i>
<i>trying to bash it to death</i>

474
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:50,040
<i>with the butt of his rifle.</i>

475
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:51,840
<i>And I think, Nigel's in there</i>
<i>with his bare hands,</i>

476
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:54,480
<i>but they're not getting</i>
<i>results. It is a little misty,</i>

477
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:57,400
<i>and they must be shooting from</i>
<i>a-- A range of at least</i>
<i>one-foot.</i>

478
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:59,040
<i>But there's a couple of hits</i>
<i>there, I think.</i>

479
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:00,560
<i>Yes, they've had a couple</i>
<i>of hits,</i>

480
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:02,160
<i>and the whole field</i>
<i>is up again</i>

481
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,520
<i>and here they are.</i>

482
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:05,480
<i>They're coming up to the debs.</i>

483
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:07,600
<i>Gervaise first, Vivian second,</i>
<i>Simon third.</i>

484
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:10,120
<i>And now they've got to take</i>
<i>the bras off from the front.</i>

485
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:14,440
<i>This is really difficult. This</i>
<i>is the most difficult part of</i>
<i>the entire competition.</i>

486
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,400
<i>My God, they're having a bit</i>
<i>of trouble in there, I think.</i>

487
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:19,760
<i>They're really trying now and</i>
<i>the crowd is getting excited</i>

488
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:22,320
<i>and I think some of the twits</i>
<i>are getting rather</i>
