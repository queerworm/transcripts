Hello, good evening
and welcome

12
00:02:54,549 --> 00:02:57,302
to the Ronald Reagan
Memorial Bowl,

13
00:03:00,139 --> 00:03:04,518
here in the pretty little
L.A. suburb of Hollywood,

14
00:03:04,559 --> 00:03:07,270
where we're about to witness
all in wrestling,

15
00:03:07,312 --> 00:03:09,481
brought to you tonight,
ladies and gentlemen,

16
00:03:09,523 --> 00:03:12,400
by the makers of Scum,

17
00:03:12,442 --> 00:03:14,945
the world's first ever
combined hair oil,

18
00:03:14,987 --> 00:03:18,949
foot ointment,
and salad dressing.

19
00:03:18,991 --> 00:03:22,619
And the makers of Titan,
the novelty nuclear missile!

20
00:03:22,661 --> 00:03:24,496
You never know
when it'll go off!

21
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,791
Surprise your friends,
amuse your enemies,

22
00:03:27,833 --> 00:03:30,585
start the party with a bang!

23
00:03:30,627 --> 00:03:32,671
Introducing,
ladies and gentlemen, tonight,

24
00:03:32,713 --> 00:03:36,508
all the way from
a mud-wrestling tour

25
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:38,093
of the OPEC countries,

26
00:03:38,135 --> 00:03:42,014
in the red corner:
Colin "Bomber" Harris!

27
00:03:45,934 --> 00:03:48,729
and, ladies and gentlemen,
in the blue corner,

28
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:50,856
all the way from
a mud-wrestling tour

29
00:03:50,898 --> 00:03:54,401
of the OPEC countries,
Colin "Bomber" Harris!

30
00:03:57,029 --> 00:03:59,865
Well, now, ladies and gentlemen,
this is the first time

31
00:03:59,907 --> 00:04:03,827
that Colin "Bomber" Harris
has met himself.

32
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:07,330
A few formalities now,
any moment now,

33
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:10,000
we'll be ready
for the start of Round One.

34
00:04:10,042 --> 00:04:11,710
There goes the bell!

35
00:04:11,752 --> 00:04:14,129
Colin moves to the middle
of the ring there,

36
00:04:14,171 --> 00:04:18,092
he's looking for an opening,
going for the handhold.

37
00:04:19,718 --> 00:04:24,347
He's got it!
Into the head-squeeze.

38
00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:26,100
A head-squeeze there.

39
00:04:26,141 --> 00:04:28,476
A favorite move of Colin's
at this opening stage.

40
00:04:28,518 --> 00:04:30,353
Flying there,

41
00:04:30,395 --> 00:04:33,314
and already Colin is working
on that weak left knee of his!

42
00:04:34,858 --> 00:04:36,401
A half nelson.

43
00:04:36,443 --> 00:04:38,237
A half nelson
and a Philadelphia Half-Lotus,

44
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:40,822
and Colin bit himself
on purpose there,

45
00:04:40,864 --> 00:04:42,866
and he has been given
a public warning by the referee,

46
00:04:42,908 --> 00:04:45,035
and Colin did not like that
one little bit!

47
00:04:46,203 --> 00:04:49,706
Forearm.
Double overhead nostril.

48
00:04:49,748 --> 00:04:53,585
Back-kick,
and into the Boston crayfish--

49
00:04:53,627 --> 00:04:55,712
no, it's a crawfish,
or is it a langoustine?

50
00:04:55,754 --> 00:04:57,464
No, it's a langoustine!
A lovely move there!

51
00:04:57,505 --> 00:04:59,049
He's caught himself by surprise
and that is it,

52
00:04:59,091 --> 00:05:01,260
the first fall to
Colin "Bomber" Harris!

53
00:05:02,343 --> 00:05:03,929
Swell! A lovely move there!

54
00:05:03,971 --> 00:05:05,889
And Colin must be
pretty pleased with himself

55
00:05:05,931 --> 00:05:07,766
having caught himself out
with that one!

56
00:05:07,808 --> 00:05:10,393
And a forearm chop.
A strawberry whip,

57
00:05:10,435 --> 00:05:13,396
a vanilla whip,
a chocolate whip...

58
00:05:13,438 --> 00:05:15,774
There it is,
Colin's most famous hold:

59
00:05:15,816 --> 00:05:18,610
the one-leg-over-shoulder
Gerry Ford,

60
00:05:18,652 --> 00:05:20,237
and Colin's in real trouble!

61
00:05:21,362 --> 00:05:22,739
He's just made it to the rope,

62
00:05:22,781 --> 00:05:24,365
just a little lucky there,
I feel.

63
00:05:24,407 --> 00:05:27,077
There it is,
a double Eydie Gorme,

64
00:05:27,119 --> 00:05:28,662
should be able
to twist out of this,

65
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:30,789
and he does,
but he's looking pretty groggy.

66
00:05:30,831 --> 00:05:32,666
And I think
he's caught himself there

67
00:05:32,707 --> 00:05:34,459
with two forearm smashes,
and that is it!

68
00:05:34,501 --> 00:05:37,171
Colin "Bomber" Harris
has knocked himself out

69
00:05:37,212 --> 00:05:39,006
and so he is the winner

70
00:05:39,047 --> 00:05:42,425
and he goes on next week
to meet himself in the final!

00:06:54,956 --> 00:06:56,624
Who?

80
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:58,252
Michelangelo,
the famous renaissance artist

81
00:06:58,293 --> 00:06:59,627
whose best known works include

82
00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:01,255
the ceiling
of the Sistine Chapel,

83
00:07:01,296 --> 00:07:02,964
and the celebrated
statue of David.

84
00:07:03,006 --> 00:07:04,591
Very well.

85
00:07:04,632 --> 00:07:06,425
In 1514,
he returned to Florence and--

86
00:07:06,467 --> 00:07:07,761
All right, that's enough,
that's enough,

87
00:07:07,802 --> 00:07:09,096
they've got it now!

88
00:07:13,141 --> 00:07:15,476
-Good evening, your Holiness.
-Evening, Michelangelo.

89
00:07:15,518 --> 00:07:18,063
I want to have a word with you
about this painting of yours,

90
00:07:18,105 --> 00:07:20,190
"The Last Supper."

91
00:07:20,232 --> 00:07:23,068
-Oh, yeah?
-I'm not happy about it.

92
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:25,445
Oh, dear. It took me hours.

93
00:07:25,486 --> 00:07:27,864
Not happy at all.

94
00:07:27,906 --> 00:07:30,284
Is it the Jell-O you don't like?

95
00:07:30,325 --> 00:07:31,826
No.

96
00:07:31,868 --> 00:07:33,328
Now they do add a bit of color,
don't they?

97
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:35,830
Oh, I know,
you don't like the kangaroo?

98
00:07:35,872 --> 00:07:38,333
-What kangaroo?
-No problem, I'll paint him out.

99
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:40,043
I never saw a kangaroo!

100
00:07:40,085 --> 00:07:41,669
He's right in the back.
I'll paint him out!

101
00:07:41,711 --> 00:07:44,005
No sweat,
I'll make him into a disciple.

102
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:49,428
-All right?
-That's the problem.

103
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:52,513
-What is?
-The disciples.

104
00:07:52,555 --> 00:07:53,890
Are they too Jewish?

105
00:07:55,809 --> 00:07:57,894
I made Judas the most Jewish.

106
00:07:57,936 --> 00:08:00,772
No, it's just that
there are 28 of them.

107
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:04,067
Oh, well, another one
will never matter,

108
00:08:04,109 --> 00:08:05,444
I'll make the kangaroo
into another one.

109
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:07,112
No, that's not the point.

110
00:08:07,154 --> 00:08:08,947
All right.
Well, I'll lose the kangaroo.

111
00:08:08,989 --> 00:08:10,657
Be honest, I wasn't
perfectly happy with it.

112
00:08:10,698 --> 00:08:14,161
That's not the point.
There are 28 disciples!

113
00:08:14,202 --> 00:08:16,871
-Too many?
-Well, of course it's too many!

114
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:18,332
Yeah, I know that,

115
00:08:18,373 --> 00:08:20,292
but I wanted
to give the impression

116
00:08:20,334 --> 00:08:22,794
of a real last supper, you know?
Not just any old last supper.

117
00:08:22,836 --> 00:08:25,755
Not like a last meal
or a final snack.

118
00:08:25,797 --> 00:08:27,299
But, you know,
I wanted to give the impression

119
00:08:27,341 --> 00:08:31,136
of a real mother of a blow-out,
you know?

120
00:08:31,178 --> 00:08:34,764
There were only 12 disciples
at the last supper.

121
00:08:34,806 --> 00:08:37,309
Well, maybe some of the
other ones came along after--

122
00:08:37,351 --> 00:08:39,144
There were only 12 altogether.

123
00:08:39,186 --> 00:08:41,062
Well, maybe some of their
friends came by, you know?

124
00:08:41,104 --> 00:08:43,398
Look!
There were just 12 disciples

125
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:47,694
and our Lord at the last supper.
The Bible clearly says so.

126
00:08:47,735 --> 00:08:50,030
-No friends?
-No friends.

127
00:08:50,071 --> 00:08:52,657
-Waiters?
-No.

128
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:54,951
-Cabaret?
-No!

129
00:08:54,993 --> 00:08:57,245
You see, I like them, they
help to flesh out the scene,

130
00:08:57,287 --> 00:08:58,538
-I could lose a few--
-Look!

131
00:08:58,579 --> 00:09:01,208
There were only 12 disciples--

132
00:09:01,249 --> 00:09:04,169
I've got it! I've got it!

133
00:09:04,211 --> 00:09:07,922
We'll call it
"The Last But One Supper"!

134
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:09,632
What?

135
00:09:09,674 --> 00:09:11,510
Well there must have been one,
if there was a last one,

136
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:13,636
there must have been
a one before that, so this...

137
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:16,139
is the "Penultimate Supper"!

138
00:09:16,181 --> 00:09:17,765
The Bible doesn't say

139
00:09:17,807 --> 00:09:19,267
how many people were there,
now, does it?

140
00:09:19,309 --> 00:09:20,977
-No--
-Well there you are, then!

141
00:09:21,019 --> 00:09:22,979
Look! The last supper
is a significant event

142
00:09:23,021 --> 00:09:26,441
in the life of our Lord,
the penultimate supper was not!

143
00:09:26,483 --> 00:09:29,444
Even if they had a conjurer
and a mariachi band.

144
00:09:29,486 --> 00:09:31,779
Now, a last supper
I commissioned from you,

145
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:33,614
and a last supper I want!

146
00:09:33,656 --> 00:09:36,493
With 12 disciples
and one Christ!

147
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:39,704
-One?!
-Yes, one!

148
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:44,084
Now will you please tell me
what in God's name possessed you

149
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:47,212
to paint this
with three Christs in it?

150
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:50,757
-It works, mate!
-Works?

151
00:09:50,798 --> 00:09:53,385
Yeah! It looks great!

152
00:09:53,427 --> 00:09:55,845
The fat one balances
the two skinny ones.

153
00:09:55,887 --> 00:09:58,723
There was only one Redeemer!

154
00:09:58,765 --> 00:10:00,392
I know that, we all know that,

155
00:10:00,434 --> 00:10:02,310
what about a bit
of artistic license?

156
00:10:02,352 --> 00:10:04,020
Well one Messiah is what I want!

157
00:10:04,062 --> 00:10:06,189
I'll tell you what you want,
mate!

158
00:10:06,231 --> 00:10:08,691
You want a bloody photographer!
That's what you want.

159
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:11,278
-Not a bloody creative artist--
-I'll tell you what I want!

160
00:10:11,319 --> 00:10:15,073
I want a last supper with
one Christ, 12 disciples,

161
00:10:15,115 --> 00:10:18,076
no kangaroos,
no trampoline acts,

162
00:10:18,118 --> 00:10:21,371
by Thursday lunch,
or you don't get paid!

163
00:10:21,413 --> 00:10:22,997
Bloody fascist!

164
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:26,334
Look! I'm the bloody pope, I am!

165
00:10:26,376 --> 00:10:29,129
May not know much about art,
but I know what I like!

166
00:10:32,006 --> 00:10:36,803
<i>Never be rude to a Pollack--</i>

167
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:49,232
<i>Hello, and welcome to Munich,</i>
<i>for the 27th Silly Olympiad,</i>

168
00:10:49,274 --> 00:10:52,819

00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,950
<i>And here we are</i>

172
00:10:58,992 --> 00:11:00,452
<i>at the start of the first event</i>
<i>of the afternoon:</i>

173
00:11:00,494 --> 00:11:02,120
<i>the second semifinal</i>
<i>of the 100 yards</i>

174
00:11:02,162 --> 00:11:04,122
<i>for people</i>
<i>with no sense of direction.</i>

175
00:11:04,164 --> 00:11:06,374
<i>I'll just give you</i>
<i>the competitors:</i>

176
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:08,460
<i>Lane one, Skolomovski of</i>
<i>Poland, lane two, Zatapatique</i>
<i>of France,</i>

177
00:11:08,502 --> 00:11:10,420
<i>lane three,</i>
<i>Gropovich of the United States.</i>

178
00:11:10,462 --> 00:11:12,005
<i>Next to him,</i>
<i>Drabble of Trinidad.</i>

179
00:11:12,046 --> 00:11:13,798
<i>Next to him, Fernandez of</i>
<i>Spain,</i>

180
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:16,050
<i>and in the outside lane,</i>
<i>Bormann of Brazil.</i>

181
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:17,469
Set!

182
00:11:20,972 --> 00:11:22,641
<i>Well, that was fun, wasn't it?</i>

183
00:11:22,681 --> 00:11:24,851
<i>And now, over to the other end</i>
<i>of the stadium.</i>

184
00:11:24,892 --> 00:11:27,437
<i>And here we're just waiting for</i>
<i>the start of the 1500 meters</i>

185
00:11:27,479 --> 00:11:28,938
<i>for the deaf.</i>

186
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:30,482
<i>And they're under</i>
<i>starter's orders.</i>

187
00:11:33,276 --> 00:11:35,236
<i>Well, we'll be coming back</i>
<i>the moment there's any action.</i>

188
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:36,904
<i>And now over to the swimming.</i>

189
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:38,948
<i>And you join us here</i>
<i>at the Bundesabsurd pool</i>

190
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:41,700
<i>just in time to see the start</i>
<i>of the 200 meters freestyle</i>

191
00:11:41,742 --> 00:11:43,537
<i>for non-swimmers.</i>

192
00:11:43,578 --> 00:11:45,580
<i>Watch for the tough Australian</i>
<i>champion, Ron Barnett,</i>

193
00:11:45,622 --> 00:11:47,290
<i>in the second lane.</i>

194
00:11:57,258 --> 00:11:59,093
<i>Well, we'll be bringing you</i>
<i>back here</i>

195
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:01,095
<i>the moment they start</i>
<i>fishing the corpses out.</i>

196
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:02,514
<i>But now over to Hans Clegg</i>
<i>for the start of the marathon</i>

197
00:12:02,556 --> 00:12:04,474
<i>for incontinents.</i>

198
00:12:04,516 --> 00:12:06,725
<i>Well, we've got an enormous</i>
<i>entry for this event.</i>

199
00:12:06,767 --> 00:12:09,521
<i>Forty-four competitors</i>
<i>from 29 different countries,</i>

200
00:12:09,563 --> 00:12:12,899
<i>all of them with the most</i>
<i>superbly weak bladders.</i>

201
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:14,984
<i>Not a tight sphincter in sight.</i>

202
00:12:15,026 --> 00:12:18,112
<i>Ready to embark, nevertheless,</i>
<i>on the world's longest race,</i>

203
00:12:18,154 --> 00:12:20,198
<i>and they're just aching to go!</i>

204
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:23,034
On your marks! Get set!

205
00:12:24,285 --> 00:12:25,912
<i>And they're off! They're off!</i>

206
00:12:29,123 --> 00:12:30,958
<i>Well, back at the 1500 meters</i>

207
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,461
<i>and the starter is putting up</i>
<i>a magnificent show!</i>

208
00:12:33,503 --> 00:12:36,464
<i>We've had volleys, rapid</i>
<i>bursts, scattered random fire,</i>

209
00:12:36,506 --> 00:12:38,383
<i>fusillades firing,</i>

210
00:12:38,425 --> 00:12:40,552
<i>well, and still he can't</i>
<i>get the buggers moving.</i>

211
00:12:40,594 --> 00:12:42,303
<i>It's enough to make you</i>
<i>chew your own foot off!</i>

212
00:12:43,388 --> 00:12:44,931
<i>And now the high jump!</i>

213
00:12:44,972 --> 00:12:46,933
<i>Katerina Ovelenski</i>
<i>for the Soviet Union.</i>

214
00:12:46,974 --> 00:12:51,730
<i>But what a jump! What a jump!</i>
<i>That's got to be a record!</i>

215
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:54,733
<i>And here we are</i>
<i>at the 3000 meter steeplechase</i>

216
00:12:54,773 --> 00:12:56,484
<i>for people who think</i>
<i>they're chickens!</i>

217
00:12:56,526 --> 00:12:58,319
<i>There's Samuelsson</i>
<i>of the United States,</i>

218
00:12:58,361 --> 00:13:00,488
<i>and over there</i>
<i>is Klaus of East Germany!</i>

219
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:02,741
<i>He's been a Rhode Island Red</i>
<i>now for the last three</i>
<i>Olympics.</i>

220
00:13:02,781 --> 00:13:04,075
<i>There's the referee</i>
<i>trying to get them going,</i>

221
00:13:04,117 --> 00:13:05,744
<i>but he's frightened them.</i>

222
00:13:05,784 --> 00:13:07,412
<i>There's the leader,</i>
<i>Abe Seagull of Canada</i>

223
00:13:07,454 --> 00:13:09,205
<i>who went off,</i>
<i>got a very good start,</i>

224
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:10,665
<i>then settled down there</i>
<i>on the water jump,</i>

225
00:13:10,707 --> 00:13:12,791
<i>and has now gone broody.</i>

226
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:15,044
<i>Now we're back with the</i>
<i>marathon for incontinents once</i>
<i>again.</i>

227
00:13:15,086 --> 00:13:17,046
<i>There's Polinski of Poland</i>
<i>in the lead,</i>

228
00:13:17,088 --> 00:13:19,466
<i>and now Brewer of Australia</i>
<i>is taking over!</i>

229
00:13:19,507 --> 00:13:21,342
<i>There's Laparche of France.</i>

230
00:13:21,384 --> 00:13:22,927
<i>Brewer has overtaken him, but</i>
<i>he's going to spend a penny.</i>

231
00:13:22,969 --> 00:13:24,429
<i>There goes Brewer</i>
<i>to spend a penny.</i>

232
00:13:24,471 --> 00:13:25,764
<i>And there goes Konig of</i>
<i>Austria.</i>

233
00:13:25,804 --> 00:13:27,265
<i>And so now it's Alvarez of</i>
<i>Cuba,</i>

234
00:13:27,307 --> 00:13:29,350
<i>followed by</i>
<i>the plucky Norwegian, Bors.</i>

235
00:13:29,392 --> 00:13:31,311
<i>They're in and out like yo-yos,</i>
<i>these boys.</i>

236
00:13:31,352 --> 00:13:32,937
<i>And there's MacNaughton.</i>
<i>MacNaughton the Scottish lad,</i>

237
00:13:32,979 --> 00:13:34,606
<i>but he can't hold it.</i>

238
00:13:34,648 --> 00:13:36,608
<i>It's Machievic,</i>
<i>Machievic of Yugoslavia</i>

239
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:38,901
<i>has taken over;</i>
<i>he can't hold it either.</i>

240
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:40,695
<i>Well, well, these must be</i>
<i>some of the weakest bladders</i>

241
00:13:40,737 --> 00:13:42,947
<i>ever to represent</i>
<i>their countries!</i>

242
00:13:42,989 --> 00:13:45,116
<i>And now, let's have a look back</i>
<i>at what's going on down on</i>
<i>stage!</i>

243
00:13:57,462 --> 00:14:00,131
Good evening, ladies and Bruces!

244
00:14:00,173 --> 00:14:01,882
-Hello, Bruce.
-G'day, Bruce.

245
00:14:01,924 --> 00:14:04,135
-How are ya, Bruce?
-What's all this lot, Bruce?

246
00:14:04,177 --> 00:14:06,929
It's very nice to be here at
the Hollywood Bowl this evening!

247
00:14:09,932 --> 00:14:11,476
We're all philosophy professors

248
00:14:11,518 --> 00:14:14,395
from the University
of Woolamaloo, Australia!

249
00:14:14,437 --> 00:14:19,275
Australia, Australia, Australia!
God love ya!

250
00:14:19,317 --> 00:14:21,361
I teach Hegelian philosophy,

251
00:14:21,402 --> 00:14:24,030
Bruce here
teaches Aristotelian philosophy,

252
00:14:24,071 --> 00:14:26,533
and Bruce here
is in charge of the sheep dip.

253
00:14:27,992 --> 00:14:29,494
Bloody difficult work,
I tell ya!

254
00:14:29,536 --> 00:14:31,078
I'll tell you what,
it's thirsty work

255
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,039
watching this kind of humor,
Bruce.

256
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,833
Why don't you stick out a few
of these little free samples

257
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:36,543
-from your Esky and leave--
-What, give these...

258
00:14:36,584 --> 00:14:38,211
Give these Americans
our precious cans of--

259
00:14:38,252 --> 00:14:39,629
See how awful they are,
grasping and go-getting.

260
00:14:39,671 --> 00:14:41,548
Okay, one over there.

261
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:43,717
You can feel morally superior
and smug.

262
00:14:43,758 --> 00:14:45,760
Right, there's one coming
right over there.

263
00:14:45,802 --> 00:14:47,136
Mind out, Charlies!

264
00:14:47,178 --> 00:14:49,472
A big one, one big one,
there we go!

265
00:14:49,514 --> 00:14:52,975
All right! Now, the reason
we do this, ladies and Bruces,

266
00:14:53,017 --> 00:14:56,813
is frankly over here
we find your American beer

267
00:14:56,855 --> 00:14:59,440
is a little like making love
in a canoe!

268
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:02,777
Making love in a canoe?

269
00:15:02,819 --> 00:15:05,488
It's fucking close to water!

270
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:06,781
Piss!

271
00:15:09,826 --> 00:15:12,328
Well now, we're going to try
and raise the tone a little here

272
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:14,163
by singing
a nice intellectual song

273
00:15:14,205 --> 00:15:16,040
for those two or three of you
in the audience...

274
00:15:16,082 --> 00:15:17,584
Right!

275
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:19,794
...who understand these things.
So, here we go!

276
00:15:19,836 --> 00:15:25,842
<i>♪ Immanuel Kant was a real</i>
<i>pissant who was very rarely</i>
<i>stable ♪</i>

Just a...

286
00:15:53,787 --> 00:15:55,496
How do you like that? All right!

287
00:15:55,538 --> 00:15:57,290
Let's hold it a second.
I can see some of these Bruces

288
00:15:57,331 --> 00:15:59,125
are in a bit of a playful mood
tonight.

289
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:01,127
-Right, Bruce?
-Some of them, yeah.

290
00:16:01,168 --> 00:16:04,046
Some of the ones that don't have
straws up their nose.

291
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:06,591
Anyway, why don't we
do something rather fun?

292
00:16:06,633 --> 00:16:09,302
Why don't we get some of these
guys to sing along with us, OK?

293
00:16:09,343 --> 00:16:11,679
And some of the Shielas, too.

294
00:16:11,721 --> 00:16:13,389
Tell them the words then,
please.

295
00:16:13,431 --> 00:16:15,099
OK,
I've got the words somewhere.

296
00:16:15,141 --> 00:16:17,017
Right. Ready!

297
00:16:17,059 --> 00:16:22,565
<i>Immanuel Kant was a real</i>
<i>pissant who was very rarely</i>
<i>stable</i>

298
00:16:22,607 --> 00:16:24,734
<i>Heidegger, Heidegger</i>
<i>was a boozy...</i>

299
00:16:24,776 --> 00:16:27,570
They're a typical
Hollywood audience!

300
00:16:27,612 --> 00:16:29,238
All the kids are on drugs,

301
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:30,824
and all the adults
are on roller skates!

302
00:16:30,865 --> 00:16:32,283
Why not?

303
00:16:32,325 --> 00:16:34,160
Very philosophical, Bruce,
I like it.

304
00:16:34,201 --> 00:16:36,036
Have we got any...
have we got anything bigger

305
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:38,748
to put the words up for these
rather short-sighted people?

306
00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:45,672
This is Bruce
from the Biology Department.

307
00:16:45,713 --> 00:16:49,592
All right. Okay, here we go.

308
00:18:11,298 --> 00:18:13,051
Good morning. I'm sorry
to have kept you waiting,

309
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:15,636
but I'm afraid my walk has
become rather sillier recently,

310
00:18:15,678 --> 00:18:19,473
so it takes me longer
to get to the office.

311
00:18:19,515 --> 00:18:21,684
Now, what was it again?

312
00:18:21,726 --> 00:18:24,896
Well sir, I-I-I-I have got
a silly walk

313
00:18:24,938 --> 00:18:26,940
and I'd like to obtain
government backing

314
00:18:26,981 --> 00:18:28,566
to help me develop it.

315
00:18:28,608 --> 00:18:31,360
I see. Well, may I see
this silly walk of yours?

316
00:18:31,402 --> 00:18:32,695
Yes, certainly.

317
00:18:55,635 --> 00:18:58,304
Yes, I see,
tha-tha-that's it, is it?

318
00:18:58,345 --> 00:18:59,973
Well, yes, that's it.

319
00:19:00,014 --> 00:19:04,226
Yes, yes, yes. It's not
particularly silly, is it?

320
00:19:04,268 --> 00:19:06,186
I mean, the left leg isn't silly
at all and the right leg

321
00:19:06,228 --> 00:19:08,481
merely does a forward
aerial O'Brien half turn

322
00:19:08,522 --> 00:19:10,190
every alternate step.

323
00:19:10,232 --> 00:19:12,110
Yes, but I feel
with a federal grant,

324
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:13,903
I could make it
a lot more silly.

325
00:19:13,945 --> 00:19:17,115
Mr. Stagback, the very real
problem is one of finance.

326
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:20,159
You see, there's defense,
education, housing, health,

327
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,577
social security, silly walks.

328
00:19:21,619 --> 00:19:23,496
They're all supposed
to get the same.

329
00:19:23,537 --> 00:19:25,665
But last year, the government
spent less on Silly Walks

330
00:19:25,706 --> 00:19:28,250
than they did
on industrial reorganization.

331
00:19:28,292 --> 00:19:32,046
We're supposed to get
348 million pounds a year

332
00:19:32,088 --> 00:19:35,675
to cover our entire
Silly Walks program.

333
00:19:35,716 --> 00:19:37,384
-Coffee?
-Yes, please.

334
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:48,187
Hello, Mrs. Twolumps... Could we
have two cups of coffee, please?

335
00:19:48,228 --> 00:19:49,981
<i>Yes, Mr. Teabag.</i>

336
00:19:50,023 --> 00:19:51,398
Mad as a hatter.

337
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,359
You see, the Israelis
already have a man

338
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,235
who can take his own
left leg off and swallow it

339
00:19:55,277 --> 00:19:58,698
with every alternate step.
Whereas the Japanese,

340
00:19:58,739 --> 00:20:01,075
cunning, electronically obsessed
little...

341
00:20:05,621 --> 00:20:07,373
Yes, thank you, Mrs. Twolumps.

342
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:12,670
You're... you're really
interested in silly walks,

343
00:20:12,712 --> 00:20:14,547
-aren't you?
-Rather!

344
00:20:14,588 --> 00:20:17,466
Right, well,
take a look at this!

345
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:13,814
Oh, I've had a bitch of
a morning in the high court!

346
00:21:13,856 --> 00:21:16,192
Oh, I could stamp
my little feet,

347
00:21:16,234 --> 00:21:17,985
the way those counsellors
carry on.

348
00:21:18,027 --> 00:21:19,695
Oh, don't I know it, love.

349
00:21:19,737 --> 00:21:23,616
Oh, dear, objection here,
objection there.

350
00:21:23,657 --> 00:21:26,994
And that nice policeman
giving his evidence so well!

351
00:21:27,036 --> 00:21:28,621
Beautiful speaking voice.

352
00:21:28,662 --> 00:21:29,914
And what a body!

353
00:21:31,999 --> 00:21:35,377
Well, after a bit all I could do
was bang me gavel.

354
00:21:36,629 --> 00:21:38,547
-You what, love?
-I banged me gavel!

355
00:21:38,589 --> 00:21:40,299
-Oh, get away!
-I did!

356
00:21:41,884 --> 00:21:44,303
I did my "silence in court" bit.

357
00:21:44,344 --> 00:21:46,055
If looks could have killed,

358
00:21:46,097 --> 00:21:48,849
that prosecuting counsel
would have been in for 30 years.

359
00:21:48,891 --> 00:21:51,060
How did your summing-up go?

360
00:21:51,102 --> 00:21:52,519
Actually...

361
00:21:58,025 --> 00:21:59,902
I did my butch voice,
you know,

362
00:21:59,944 --> 00:22:03,363
"what the jury must understand",
and they loved it!

363
00:22:03,405 --> 00:22:05,825
I could see that little
curly-headed foreman of the jury

364
00:22:05,866 --> 00:22:07,367
-eyeing me!
-Really?

365
00:22:07,409 --> 00:22:09,078
Oh, yeah. Cheeky devil!

366
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:12,248
I finished up with--
I got really strict:

367
00:22:12,290 --> 00:22:14,167
"The actions
of these vicious men

368
00:22:14,208 --> 00:22:17,503
are a violent stain
upon the community,

369
00:22:17,544 --> 00:22:19,672
and the full penalty of the law

370
00:22:19,713 --> 00:22:22,967
is scarcely sufficient to deal
with their ghastly crimes!"

371
00:22:23,009 --> 00:22:25,052
And I waggled me wig!

372
00:22:25,094 --> 00:22:26,804
-You waggled you what?
-I waggled me wig!

373
00:22:26,846 --> 00:22:28,055
Really?

374
00:22:28,097 --> 00:22:29,515
That was the only thing
I waggled.

375
00:22:29,556 --> 00:22:31,767
Ever so slightly,
stunning effect.

376
00:22:31,809 --> 00:22:34,145
Anyway, I gave him three years.
He only took ten minutes.

377
00:22:35,813 --> 00:22:38,482
Well, as I said to Melvin Belly
the other day, you know:

378
00:22:38,524 --> 00:22:40,400
"You can put it in the hand
of your attorneys,

379
00:22:40,442 --> 00:22:42,069
but it'll never stand up
in court!"

380
00:22:42,111 --> 00:22:43,529
Oh, I know what you mean.

381
00:24:03,525 --> 00:24:06,820
Good evening.
Tonight on World Forum

382
00:24:06,862 --> 00:24:11,033
we are deeply privileged
to have with us Karl Marx,

383
00:24:11,075 --> 00:24:12,492
the founder of modern socialism

384
00:24:12,534 --> 00:24:14,745
and author of
the Communist Manifesto;

385
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:18,707
Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov,

386
00:24:18,749 --> 00:24:20,960
better known to the world
as Lenin,

387
00:24:21,001 --> 00:24:23,045
leader of the
Russian Revolution,

388
00:24:23,087 --> 00:24:26,424
writer, statesman,
and father of modern socialism;

389
00:24:26,464 --> 00:24:29,385
Che Guevara,
the Bolivian guerilla leader;

390
00:24:30,928 --> 00:24:32,638
and Mao Tse-tung,

391
00:24:32,679 --> 00:24:36,142
chairman of the Chinese
Communist Party since 1949.

392
00:24:37,977 --> 00:24:41,063
And the first question
is for you, Karl Marx.

393
00:24:42,189 --> 00:24:44,024
"The Hammers."

394
00:24:44,066 --> 00:24:47,320
"The Hammers" is the nickname
of what English football team?

395
00:24:53,909 --> 00:24:56,329
"The Hammers."

396
00:24:56,370 --> 00:25:01,125
No? Well, bad luck, Karl.
It is, in fact, West Ham United.

397
00:25:01,167 --> 00:25:05,254
Now, Che Guevara. Che.

398
00:25:05,296 --> 00:25:06,880
Coventry City

399
00:25:06,922 --> 00:25:10,301
last won the English
Football Cup in what year?

400
00:25:13,846 --> 00:25:15,389
No?
I can throw the question open.

401
00:25:15,431 --> 00:25:16,932
Anybody else?

402
00:25:16,974 --> 00:25:19,517
Coventry City last won
the English Football Cup

403
00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:21,519
in what year?

404
00:25:21,561 --> 00:25:23,605
No, well, I'm not surprised
you didn't get that.

405
00:25:23,647 --> 00:25:25,358
It is in fact a trick question.

406
00:25:25,399 --> 00:25:28,277
Coventry City have never won
the English Football Cup.

407
00:25:30,654 --> 00:25:33,615
So now with the scores all even,
it's on to Round two,

408
00:25:33,657 --> 00:25:36,202
and Lenin, your starter
for ten dollars...

409
00:25:38,536 --> 00:25:40,289
Jerry Lee Lewis

410
00:25:40,331 --> 00:25:44,502
has had over 17 major solid
gold hits in the U.S. of A.

411
00:25:44,542 --> 00:25:46,086
What's the name of the biggest?

412
00:25:49,923 --> 00:25:52,968
Jerry Lee Lewis'
solid gold biggie?

413
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:56,055
No?

414
00:25:56,096 --> 00:25:59,641
-Yes, Mao Tse-tung?
-"Great Balls of Fire"?

415
00:25:59,683 --> 00:26:01,352
Yes, it was indeed!

416
00:26:05,939 --> 00:26:07,400
Very well challenged.

417
00:26:07,441 --> 00:26:08,859
Well, now we come on
to our third round.

418
00:26:08,901 --> 00:26:11,904
Our contestant tonight
is Karl Marx

419
00:26:11,945 --> 00:26:17,368
and our special prize
is this beautiful lounge suite!

420
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:20,578
Karl has elected
to answer questions

421
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:22,831
on workers'
control of factories,

422
00:26:22,873 --> 00:26:26,419
so here we go with question
number one. You, nervous, Karl?

423
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:27,669
Just a little.

424
00:26:27,711 --> 00:26:30,381
Well never mind, Karl,
have a go!

425
00:26:30,423 --> 00:26:33,759
The development
of the industrial proletariat

426
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:36,512
is conditioned by
what other development?

427
00:26:36,554 --> 00:26:39,639
The development
of the industrial bourgeoisie.

428
00:26:39,681 --> 00:26:42,309
Good! Yes, it is indeed!
Well done, Karl!

429
00:26:42,351 --> 00:26:45,563
You're on your way
to a lounge suite!

430
00:26:45,603 --> 00:26:47,398
Now Karl, number two.

431
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:52,986
The struggle of class against
class is a what struggle?

432
00:26:53,028 --> 00:26:56,614
-A political struggle.
-Good! Yes, it is indeed.

433
00:26:58,033 --> 00:26:59,785
Well done, Karl!
One final question,

434
00:26:59,826 --> 00:27:02,662
and that beautiful
non-materialistic lounge suite

435
00:27:02,704 --> 00:27:04,790
will be yours!

436
00:27:04,831 --> 00:27:08,586
Ready, Karl? You're a brave man.
Your final question:

437
00:27:08,626 --> 00:27:13,006
Who won the English Football Cup
in 1949?

438
00:27:13,048 --> 00:27:14,883
The workers control
the means of production?

439
00:27:14,925 --> 00:27:17,386
The struggle
of the urban proletariat?

440
00:27:17,428 --> 00:27:19,263
No, it was
Wolverhampton Wanderers

441
00:27:19,305 --> 00:27:21,140
who beat Leicester 3-1.

442
00:27:21,181 --> 00:27:22,600
Oh, shit!

443
00:27:24,143 --> 00:27:25,603
Get out of here!

444
00:27:27,563 --> 00:27:30,648
Well, no one leaves this show
empty-handed,

445
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:32,610
so we're gonna
cut off his hands.

446
00:27:34,487 --> 00:27:36,572
Well, now,
it's talent-spotting time,

447
00:27:36,614 --> 00:27:37,990
ladies and gentlemen,

448
00:27:38,031 --> 00:27:40,117
and please see if you can spot
any talent

449
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:41,910
in our next competitors.

450
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:44,204
Will you please give a very
big hand and a warm welcome

451
00:27:44,246 --> 00:27:48,041
to Carl Weetabix and Rita!

-Mr. Hilton?
-Yes.

471
00:29:33,063 --> 00:29:35,107
You are sole proprietor
and owner

472
00:29:35,148 --> 00:29:37,067
of the Whizzo Chocolate Company?

473
00:29:37,109 --> 00:29:38,402
I am.

474
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:44,283
Constable Parrot and I
are from the Hygiene Squad...

475
00:29:44,324 --> 00:29:45,576
Oh, yes.

476
00:29:45,618 --> 00:29:46,993
...and we'd like to have
a word with you

477
00:29:47,035 --> 00:29:48,412
about your box of chocolates
entitled

478
00:29:48,454 --> 00:29:49,955
"The Whizzo Quality Assortment."

479
00:29:49,996 --> 00:29:51,331
Good, yes.

480
00:29:51,373 --> 00:29:52,999
If I may begin at the beginning.

481
00:29:53,041 --> 00:29:55,753
First, there is
the Cherry Fondue.

482
00:29:55,794 --> 00:29:58,797
Now this is extremely nasty,

483
00:29:58,838 --> 00:30:00,924
but we can't prosecute you
for that!

484
00:30:00,966 --> 00:30:02,509
Agreed.

485
00:30:02,551 --> 00:30:05,679
Next we have number four,
"Crunchy Frog."

486
00:30:05,721 --> 00:30:07,389
Yes.

487
00:30:07,431 --> 00:30:10,434
Am I right in thinking
there's a real frog in here?

488
00:30:10,476 --> 00:30:12,185
Yes, a little one.

489
00:30:12,227 --> 00:30:14,480
-Is it cooked?
-No.

490
00:30:14,521 --> 00:30:16,064
What, a raw frog?

491
00:30:16,106 --> 00:30:19,151
We use only
the finest baby frogs,

492
00:30:19,192 --> 00:30:21,403
dew picked and flown from Iraq,

493
00:30:21,445 --> 00:30:24,615
cleansed in the finest quality
spring water, lightly killed,

494
00:30:24,657 --> 00:30:27,117
and sealed in a succulent
Swiss quintuple-smooth

495
00:30:27,159 --> 00:30:29,328
full-cream treble
milk chocolate envelope,

496
00:30:29,369 --> 00:30:32,122
and lovingly frosted
with glucose!

497
00:30:32,164 --> 00:30:35,250
That's as may be,
but it's still a frog!

498
00:30:35,292 --> 00:30:36,752
What else would it be?

499
00:30:36,794 --> 00:30:39,379
Well, don't you even
take the bones out?

500
00:30:39,421 --> 00:30:40,756
If we took the bones out,

501
00:30:40,798 --> 00:30:42,174
it wouldn't be crunchy,
would it?

502
00:30:45,761 --> 00:30:48,388
Constable Parrot
ate one of those!

503
00:30:48,430 --> 00:30:49,973
Would you excuse me
for a moment, sir?

504
00:30:50,015 --> 00:30:51,558
Yes.

505
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:54,269
Well, it says "Crunchy Frog"
quite clearly.

506
00:30:54,311 --> 00:30:56,062
Well, never mind that.

507
00:30:56,104 --> 00:30:57,897
We have to protect the public.
People aren't going to think

508
00:30:57,939 --> 00:30:59,817
there's a real frog
in chocolate.

509
00:30:59,858 --> 00:31:02,528
The superintendent
thought it was an Almond Whirl.

510
00:31:02,569 --> 00:31:05,280
They're bound to think
it's some kind of mock frog.

511
00:31:05,322 --> 00:31:06,948
Mock frog?!

512
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:09,326
We use no artificial
preservatives or additives

513
00:31:09,368 --> 00:31:10,952
of any kind!

514
00:31:10,994 --> 00:31:12,579
Nevertheless,
I advise you to in future

515
00:31:12,621 --> 00:31:14,498
to replace the words
"Crunchy Frog"

516
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:18,960
with the legend "Crunchy, raw,
unboned, real, dead frog"

517
00:31:19,002 --> 00:31:21,296
if you want to avoid
prosecution.

518
00:31:21,338 --> 00:31:22,756
What about our sales?

519
00:31:22,798 --> 00:31:24,257
I don't give a damn
about your sales.

520
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:25,634
We have to protect the public!

521
00:31:25,676 --> 00:31:26,844
Now, what was this one?
Number five.

522
00:31:26,885 --> 00:31:28,762
It was number five, wasn't it?

523
00:31:28,804 --> 00:31:32,307
Number five:
"Ram's Bladder Cup!"

524
00:31:37,103 --> 00:31:39,606
Now what kind of confection
is this?

525
00:31:39,648 --> 00:31:43,985
We use choicest juicy chunks
of fresh Cornish ram's bladder,

526
00:31:44,027 --> 00:31:47,531
emptied, steamed,
flavored with sesame seeds,

527
00:31:47,573 --> 00:31:50,659
whipped into a fondue,
and garnished with larks' vomit!

528
00:31:50,701 --> 00:31:53,704
-Larks' vomit?
-Correct.

529
00:31:53,746 --> 00:31:57,416
It doesn't say anything
down here about larks' vomit!

530
00:31:57,457 --> 00:31:59,292
Yes, it does.

531
00:31:59,334 --> 00:32:01,378
On the bottom of the box,
after monosodium glutamate.

532
00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:05,131
I hardly think
this is good enough!

533
00:32:05,173 --> 00:32:08,301
It would be more appropriate
if the box bore a big red label.

534
00:32:08,343 --> 00:32:10,888
"Warning: Larks' Vomit!"

535
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:12,598
Our sales would plummet!

536
00:32:12,639 --> 00:32:14,015
Well, why don't you move into

537
00:32:14,057 --> 00:32:15,726
more conventional areas
of confectionery,

538
00:32:15,768 --> 00:32:18,019
like praline or lime cream,

539
00:32:18,061 --> 00:32:19,938
a very popular flavor
I'm led to understand,

540
00:32:19,979 --> 00:32:21,565
or Strawberry Delight?

541
00:32:21,607 --> 00:32:22,816
I mean, what's this one?

542
00:32:22,858 --> 00:32:24,693
"Cockroach Cluster"?

543
00:32:26,069 --> 00:32:28,572
And this, "Anthrax Ripple"?

544
00:32:48,425 --> 00:32:51,261
And what's this one,
"Spring Surprise"?

545
00:32:51,303 --> 00:32:53,346
Ah, that's our specialty!

546
00:32:53,388 --> 00:32:56,015
Covered in darkest,
velvety smooth chocolate,

547
00:32:56,057 --> 00:32:58,852
when you pop it into your mouth,
stainless steel bolts spring out

548
00:32:58,894 --> 00:33:01,146
and punch straight through
both cheeks!

549
00:33:04,566 --> 00:33:07,193
If people pop a nice choccy
in their mouth,

550
00:33:07,235 --> 00:33:10,363
they don't expect
to get their cheeks pierced!

551
00:33:10,405 --> 00:33:14,200
In any case, it is an inadequate
description of the sweetmeat!

552
00:33:14,242 --> 00:33:16,578
I shall have to ask you
to accompany me to the station.

553
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:19,038
-It's a fair cop.
-And don't talk to the audience!

554
00:33:45,941 --> 00:33:47,484
Albatross!

555
00:33:50,904 --> 00:33:52,572
Albatross!

556
00:33:59,830 --> 00:34:02,499
You're not supposed
to be smoking that!

557
00:34:04,835 --> 00:34:06,962
Albatross! Don't take them!

558
00:34:07,004 --> 00:34:10,048
What flavor is it?
What flavor is it?

559
00:34:10,089 --> 00:34:11,633
Seagullsickle!

560
00:34:13,927 --> 00:34:15,554
Pelican-bonbon!

561
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:19,474
Albatross!

562
00:34:19,516 --> 00:34:21,894
Could I have... Could I have
two ice creams, please?

563
00:34:21,935 --> 00:34:24,688
I haven't got any ice creams,
I just got this albatross!

564
00:34:24,730 --> 00:34:28,149
-Albatross!
-What flavor is it?

565
00:34:29,693 --> 00:34:31,319
Well, it's an albatross,
isn't it?

566
00:34:31,361 --> 00:34:33,906
It's not any bloody flavor!

567
00:34:33,947 --> 00:34:35,782
Albatross!

568
00:34:35,824 --> 00:34:37,701
There's gotta be some flavor,
I mean everything's got a--

569
00:34:37,743 --> 00:34:41,246
All right, all right!
It's bloody albatross flavor!

570
00:34:41,287 --> 00:34:46,626
Bleedin' seabird,
bleedin' flavor! Albatross!

571
00:34:46,668 --> 00:34:48,545
Do you get wafers with it?

572
00:34:48,587 --> 00:34:50,714
Of course you don't get fucking
wafers with it, you cunt!

573
00:34:50,756 --> 00:34:52,841
It's a fucking albatross,
I mean...

574
00:34:52,883 --> 00:34:57,345
Stop that!
Stop that! It's filthy!

575
00:34:57,387 --> 00:34:59,472
Hold on! Right now, we need you!

576
00:34:59,514 --> 00:35:02,141
The one in the black, we need
you for another skit on stage.

577
00:35:02,183 --> 00:35:04,895
And you, get off! You're not
even a proper woman!

578
00:35:04,937 --> 00:35:06,772
Don't you oppress me, mate!

579
00:35:06,813 --> 00:35:09,190
What are you trying to do?
Avoid registration or something?

580
00:35:09,232 --> 00:35:10,692
Bleedin' sexist!

581
00:35:10,734 --> 00:35:13,862
Come along,
we need you for a skit!

582
00:35:13,904 --> 00:35:16,239
No one enjoys a good laugh
more than I do.

583
00:35:16,281 --> 00:35:19,576
Except perhaps for my wife
and some of her friends.

584
00:35:19,618 --> 00:35:21,703
Oh, yes, and Captain Johnson.
Come to think of it,

585
00:35:21,745 --> 00:35:23,455
most people enjoy a good laugh
more than I do,

586
00:35:23,496 --> 00:35:24,957
but that's beside the point.
Right!

587
00:35:24,998 --> 00:35:26,374
Let's get on with this skit!

588
00:35:26,416 --> 00:35:28,293
Where's the other person
for this skit?

589
00:35:28,334 --> 00:35:30,169
Right,
you want to sit in that chair?

590
00:35:31,254 --> 00:35:35,341
And cue the skit!

591
00:35:35,383 --> 00:35:38,595
-Evening, squire!
-Good evening.

592
00:35:42,599 --> 00:35:44,601
Is your... is your wife a goer?

593
00:35:44,643 --> 00:35:46,144
Eh? Know what I mean?
Know what I mean?

594
00:35:46,185 --> 00:35:48,063
Nudge, nudge! Know what I mean?
Say no more!

595
00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:52,651
I... I beg your pardon?

596
00:35:52,692 --> 00:35:55,654
Your... your wife.
Does she go, eh?

597
00:35:55,695 --> 00:35:57,405
Does she go, eh? Eh?

598
00:35:57,447 --> 00:35:59,908
Well, she sometimes has to go,
yes, of course.

599
00:36:01,118 --> 00:36:03,036
I bet she does! I bet she does!

600
00:36:03,078 --> 00:36:04,704
Say no more!
Say no more!

601
00:36:04,746 --> 00:36:06,915
Know what I mean? Nudge, nudge!

602
00:36:06,957 --> 00:36:09,042
I'm afraid
I don't quite follow you.

603
00:36:09,084 --> 00:36:11,670
Oh, "follow me, follow me"?
That's good, that's very good!

604
00:36:11,711 --> 00:36:14,673
A nod's as good as a wink
to a blind bat!

605
00:36:16,215 --> 00:36:17,884
Are you selling something?

606
00:36:17,926 --> 00:36:20,762
"Selling, selling,"
very good indeed!

607
00:36:20,804 --> 00:36:23,431
You're wicked, you are, eh?
Wicked, eh?

608
00:36:25,475 --> 00:36:28,979
Wicked! Say no more!

609
00:36:31,439 --> 00:36:35,568
So your wife's interested in...
in sport? Eh?

610
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:37,612
She likes sport, yes.

611
00:36:37,654 --> 00:36:40,615
I bet she does! I bet she does!

612
00:36:40,657 --> 00:36:43,201
As a matter of fact,
she's very fond of cricket.

613
00:36:43,242 --> 00:36:46,245
She likes "games", eh?
Likes "games"?

614
00:36:46,287 --> 00:36:47,831
Knew she would,
she's been around a bit, eh?

615
00:36:47,873 --> 00:36:49,541
She's been around?

616
00:36:49,582 --> 00:36:51,668
Well, she has travelled, yes.
She's from Glendale.

617
00:36:59,467 --> 00:37:01,427
Say no more!

618
00:37:05,182 --> 00:37:07,017
Glendale, squire? Say no more!

619
00:37:07,059 --> 00:37:09,811
Say no more! Say no more!
Say no more!

620
00:37:13,815 --> 00:37:20,279
Is your... is your Glendale wife
interested in photography? Eh?

621
00:37:20,321 --> 00:37:21,948
Photography?

622
00:37:21,990 --> 00:37:24,242
"Photographs, eh?"
he asked him knowingly!

623
00:37:25,535 --> 00:37:26,870
Photography?

624
00:37:26,912 --> 00:37:28,080
Snap, snap,
grin, grin, wink, wink,

625
00:37:28,121 --> 00:37:30,165
nudge, nudge, say no more!

626
00:37:30,207 --> 00:37:32,000
Sort of, holiday snaps,
you mean?

627
00:37:32,042 --> 00:37:34,002
They could be, they could be
taken on holiday, you know!

628
00:37:34,044 --> 00:37:37,547
Swimming costumes, candid...
you know, "candid" photography?

629
00:37:37,589 --> 00:37:39,091
No, we don't have a camera!

630
00:37:40,175 --> 00:37:41,342
Still...

631
00:37:49,392 --> 00:37:51,436
Look,
are you insinuating something?

632
00:37:53,230 --> 00:37:56,024
Oh, no, no, no...

633
00:37:56,066 --> 00:37:57,358
Yes!

634
00:37:58,693 --> 00:38:00,403
Well?

635
00:38:00,445 --> 00:38:02,405
Well, I mean, you're a man
of the world, squire,

636
00:38:02,447 --> 00:38:04,657
you know...
you've been around, you know?

637
00:38:04,699 --> 00:38:06,826
What do you mean?

638
00:38:06,868 --> 00:38:10,329
Well, I mean, like, you've...
you know, you, like...

639
00:38:10,371 --> 00:38:15,085
you've done it, you know...
you've slept... with a lady?

640
00:38:18,296 --> 00:38:19,672
Yes.

641
00:38:20,799 --> 00:38:22,175
What's it like?

642
00:38:27,222 --> 00:38:29,891
<i>Good afternoon, and welcome to</i>
<i>a packed Olympic stadium,</i>

643
00:38:29,933 --> 00:38:32,936
<i>Munchen, for the second leg</i>
<i>of this exciting final.</i>

644
00:38:36,982 --> 00:38:38,399
<i>And here come the Germans now,</i>

645
00:38:38,441 --> 00:38:40,610
<i>led by their skipper</i>
<i>"Nobby" Hegel.</i>

646
00:38:40,652 --> 00:38:42,612
<i>They must surely start</i>
<i>favorites this afternoon.</i>

647
00:38:42,654 --> 00:38:44,697
<i>They've certainly attracted the</i>
<i>most attention from the press</i>

648
00:38:44,739 --> 00:38:46,950
<i>with their team problems.</i>

649
00:38:46,992 --> 00:38:49,661
<i>And let's now see their</i>
<i>line-up:</i>

650
00:38:49,702 --> 00:38:52,455
<i>The Germans playing 4-2-4,</i>
<i>Leibniz in goal,</i>

651
00:38:52,497 --> 00:38:55,333
<i>back four Kant, Hegel,</i>
<i>Schopenhauer, and Schelling,</i>

652
00:38:55,374 --> 00:38:57,002
<i>front-runners</i>
<i>Schlegel, Wittgenstein,</i>

653
00:38:57,043 --> 00:38:58,795
<i>Nietzsche and Heidegger,</i>

654
00:38:58,837 --> 00:39:00,880
<i>and the midfield duo</i>
<i>of Beckenbauer and Jaspers.</i>

655
00:39:00,922 --> 00:39:03,258
<i>Beckenbauer obviously</i>
<i>a bit of a surprise there.</i>

656
00:39:05,468 --> 00:39:07,386
<i>And here come the Greeks,</i>

657
00:39:07,428 --> 00:39:09,055
<i>led out by their veteran</i>
<i>center half Herakleitos.</i>

658
00:39:09,097 --> 00:39:11,016
<i>Let's look at their team:</i>

659
00:39:11,057 --> 00:39:12,892
<i>As you'd expect, it's a much</i>
<i>more defensive line-up.</i>

660
00:39:12,934 --> 00:39:14,686
<i>Plato's in goal,</i>
<i>Socrates a front-runner there,</i>

661
00:39:14,727 --> 00:39:16,271
<i>and Aristotle as sweeper.</i>

662
00:39:16,313 --> 00:39:18,857
<i>Aristotle,</i>
<i>very much the man in form.</i>

663
00:39:18,898 --> 00:39:21,943
<i>One surprise is the inclusion</i>
<i>of Archimedes.</i>

664
00:39:25,322 --> 00:39:27,157
<i>Well, here comes the referee:</i>

665
00:39:27,199 --> 00:39:28,867
<i>K'ung fu-tsze (Confucius)</i>
<i>and his two linesmen,</i>

666
00:39:28,908 --> 00:39:31,036
<i>St Augustine</i>
<i>and St Thomas Aquinas.</i>

667
00:39:31,077 --> 00:39:34,413
<i>And as the two skippers</i>
<i>come together to shake hands,</i>

668
00:39:34,455 --> 00:39:36,708
<i>we're ready for the start</i>
<i>of this very exciting final.</i>

669
00:39:36,749 --> 00:39:41,046
<i>The referee, Mr. Confucius,</i>
<i>checks his sand, and...</i>

670
00:39:41,087 --> 00:39:42,463
<i>They're off!</i>

671
00:39:42,505 --> 00:39:44,590
<i>Nietzsche and Hegel there,</i>

672
00:39:44,632 --> 00:39:46,551
<i>Karl Jaspers number seven</i>
<i>on the outside,</i>

673
00:39:46,592 --> 00:39:49,012
<i>Wittgenstein there with him.</i>

674
00:39:49,054 --> 00:39:51,556
<i>There's Beckenbauer,</i>
<i>Schelling's in there,</i>

675
00:39:51,597 --> 00:39:55,352
<i>Heidegger covering.</i>
<i>Schopenhauer.</i>

676
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:59,022
<i>And now it's the Greeks.</i>
<i>Epikuros, Plotinus number six,</i>

677
00:39:59,064 --> 00:40:03,109
<i>Aristotle, Empedokles of</i>
<i>Acraga, and Demokrites with</i>
<i>him.</i>

678
00:40:03,151 --> 00:40:07,197
<i>There's Archimedes, Socrates,</i>
<i>there he is, Socrates.</i>

679
00:40:09,074 --> 00:40:12,202
<i>Socrates there going through...</i>

680
00:40:12,244 --> 00:40:14,329
<i>There's the ball,</i>
<i>there's the ball!</i>

681
00:40:14,371 --> 00:40:17,123
<i>We'll be bringing you back</i>
<i>to this exciting contest</i>

682
00:40:17,165 --> 00:40:20,168
<i>the moment anything interesting</i>
<i>happens.</i>

683
00:40:27,884 --> 00:40:30,136
Very passable, this, eh?
Very passable.

684
00:40:30,178 --> 00:40:32,389
Nothing like a good glass
of Château de Chasselet,

685
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:35,808
-eh, Josiah?
-You're right there, Obadiah.

686
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:38,728
Who would have thought,
30 years ago,

687
00:40:38,770 --> 00:40:42,690
we'd all be sitting here
drinking Château de Chasselet?

688
00:40:42,732 --> 00:40:45,151
Them days we were glad to have
the price of a cup of tea.

689
00:40:45,193 --> 00:40:47,028
Aye! A cup of cold tea!

690
00:40:47,070 --> 00:40:48,696
Without milk or sugar!

691
00:40:48,738 --> 00:40:50,656
Or tea!

692
00:40:50,698 --> 00:40:52,992
In a cracked cup and all.

693
00:40:53,034 --> 00:40:54,869
Oh, we never used to have a cup!

694
00:40:54,911 --> 00:40:58,290
We used to have to drink
out of a rolled-up newspaper!

695
00:40:58,331 --> 00:41:02,168
The best we could manage was to
suck on a piece of damp cloth.

696
00:41:02,210 --> 00:41:04,129
But you know,
we were happy in those days,

697
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:05,463
although we were poor.

698
00:41:05,504 --> 00:41:07,090
Because we were poor!

699
00:41:07,132 --> 00:41:08,674
My old dad used to say to me:

700
00:41:08,716 --> 00:41:10,593
"Money doesn't
bring you happiness, son!"

701
00:41:10,635 --> 00:41:12,137
He was right!

702
00:41:12,178 --> 00:41:14,472
I was happier then
and I had nothing!

703
00:41:14,513 --> 00:41:17,642
We used to live in this
tiny old tumble-down house

704
00:41:17,683 --> 00:41:20,103
with great big holes
in the roof.

705
00:41:20,145 --> 00:41:22,439
House! You were lucky
to live in a house!

706
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,316
We used to live in one room,

707
00:41:24,357 --> 00:41:26,943
all 26 of us, no furniture,
half the floor was missing,

708
00:41:26,985 --> 00:41:30,863
we were all huddled together in
one corner for fear of falling.

709
00:41:30,905 --> 00:41:32,615
You were lucky to have a room!

710
00:41:32,657 --> 00:41:34,451
We used to have to live
in the corridor!

711
00:41:34,492 --> 00:41:37,703
Oh, we used to dream
of living in a corridor!

712
00:41:39,497 --> 00:41:41,333
Would have been a palace to us!

713
00:41:41,374 --> 00:41:45,253
We used to live in an old
water tank on a rubbish tip.

714
00:41:45,295 --> 00:41:48,423
We got woke up every morning
by having a load of rotting fish

715
00:41:48,465 --> 00:41:50,425
dumped all over us!

716
00:41:50,467 --> 00:41:52,260
House? Huh!

717
00:41:52,302 --> 00:41:54,762
Well, when I say "house",
it was just a hole in the ground

718
00:41:54,804 --> 00:41:59,351
covered by a sheet of tarpaulin,
but it was a house to us!

719
00:41:59,392 --> 00:42:01,769
We were evicted
from our hole in the ground.

720
00:42:02,937 --> 00:42:04,730
We had to go and live in a lake!

721
00:42:06,149 --> 00:42:07,942
You were lucky to have a lake!

722
00:42:07,984 --> 00:42:10,736
There were 150 of us
living in a shoebox

723
00:42:10,778 --> 00:42:12,322
in the middle of the road!

724
00:42:14,073 --> 00:42:15,283
A cardboard box?

725
00:42:15,325 --> 00:42:18,077
-Aye!
-You were lucky!

726
00:42:18,119 --> 00:42:20,579
We lived for three months
in a rolled-up newspaper

727
00:42:20,621 --> 00:42:23,124
in a septic tank!

728
00:42:23,166 --> 00:42:25,626
We used to have to get up
every morning, at six o'clock

729
00:42:25,668 --> 00:42:27,795
and clean the newspaper,
go to work down the mill,

730
00:42:27,837 --> 00:42:29,630
fourteen hours a day,
week in, week out,

731
00:42:29,672 --> 00:42:32,091
for sixpence a week,
and when we got home,

732
00:42:32,133 --> 00:42:35,387
our dad would thrash us to sleep
with his belt!

733
00:42:36,721 --> 00:42:37,930
Luxury!

734
00:42:39,432 --> 00:42:41,142
We used to have to
get out of the lake

735
00:42:41,184 --> 00:42:42,643
at three o'clock in the morning,

736
00:42:42,685 --> 00:42:44,396
clean the lake,
eat a handful of hot gravel,

737
00:42:44,437 --> 00:42:46,564
work 20 hours a day at mill
for tuppence a month,

738
00:42:46,605 --> 00:42:48,233
come home, and dad would
beat us around the head

739
00:42:48,274 --> 00:42:51,027
and neck with a broken bottle,
if we were lucky!

740
00:42:53,363 --> 00:42:55,573
Well, of course we had it tough!

741
00:42:55,614 --> 00:42:57,534
We used to have to get up
out of the shoebox

742
00:42:57,575 --> 00:42:59,035
in the middle of the night,

743
00:42:59,077 --> 00:43:01,996
and lick the road clean
with our tongues!

744
00:43:02,038 --> 00:43:04,749
We had to eat half a handful
of freezing cold gravel,

745
00:43:04,790 --> 00:43:07,126
work 24 hours a day at mill
for fourpence every six years,

746
00:43:07,168 --> 00:43:08,753
and when we got home,

747
00:43:08,794 --> 00:43:11,089
our dad would slice us in two
with a breadknife!

748
00:43:13,216 --> 00:43:15,510
Right.

749
00:43:15,552 --> 00:43:17,470
I had to get up in the morning,
at ten o'clock at night,

750
00:43:17,512 --> 00:43:19,764
half an hour before
I went to bed,

751
00:43:19,805 --> 00:43:21,640
eat a lump of cold poison,

752
00:43:21,682 --> 00:43:23,642
work 29 hours a day
down mill

753
00:43:23,684 --> 00:43:25,728
and pay mill-owner
for permission to come to work,

754
00:43:25,770 --> 00:43:27,146
and when we got home,

755
00:43:27,188 --> 00:43:28,814
our dad would kill us

756
00:43:28,856 --> 00:43:30,816
and dance about on our graves,
singing Hallelujah!

757
00:43:33,361 --> 00:43:36,864
And you try and tell
the young people of today that,

758
00:43:36,906 --> 00:43:37,990
and they won't believe you!

759
00:43:38,032 --> 00:43:39,367
No, no they won't!

760
00:43:44,289 --> 00:43:46,040
<i>Well, there may be no score,</i>

761
00:43:46,082 --> 00:43:47,584
<i>but there's certainly no lack</i>
<i>of excitement here.</i>

762
00:43:47,625 --> 00:43:49,627
<i>As you can see,</i>

763
00:43:49,668 --> 00:43:51,546
<i>Nietzsche has just been booked</i>
<i>for arguing with the referee.</i>

764
00:43:51,588 --> 00:43:53,672
<i>He accused Confucius</i>
<i>of having no free will,</i>

765
00:43:53,714 --> 00:43:56,008
<i>and Confucius, he say,</i>
<i>"Name go in book."</i>

766
00:43:56,050 --> 00:44:00,346
<i>And this is Nietzsche's</i>
<i>third booking in four games.</i>

767
00:44:00,388 --> 00:44:03,391
<i>And, who's that? It's Karl</i>
<i>Marx. Karl Marx is warming up.</i>

768
00:44:03,433 --> 00:44:04,976
<i>It looks as though</i>
<i>there's going to be</i>

769
00:44:05,017 --> 00:44:07,019
<i>a substitution</i>
<i>on the German side.</i>

770
00:44:07,061 --> 00:44:08,980
<i>Obviously manager,</i>
<i>Martin Luther,</i>

771
00:44:09,021 --> 00:44:11,732
<i>has decided on all-out attack,</i>
<i>as indeed he must,</i>

772
00:44:11,774 --> 00:44:13,692
<i>with only two minutes</i>
<i>of the match to go.</i>

773
00:44:13,734 --> 00:44:15,861
<i>But the big question is:</i>
<i>Who is he going to replace?</i>

774
00:44:15,903 --> 00:44:18,072
<i>Who is going to come off?</i>
<i>It could be Jaspers,</i>

775
00:44:18,114 --> 00:44:19,782
<i>Hegel or Schopenhauer.</i>

776
00:44:19,824 --> 00:44:21,367
<i>But it's Wittgenstein!</i>
<i>Wittgenstein, who saw his aunty</i>

777
00:44:21,409 --> 00:44:23,661
<i>only last week!</i>
<i>And here's Marx!</i>

778
00:44:23,702 --> 00:44:25,704
<i>Let's see if he can put some</i>
<i>life into this German attack.</i>

779
00:44:25,746 --> 00:44:27,999
<i>Evidently not. What a shame.</i>

780
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:29,959
<i>Well, now,</i>
<i>with just over a minute left,</i>

781
00:44:30,001 --> 00:44:32,211
<i>a replay on Tuesday</i>
<i>looks absolutely vital.</i>

782
00:44:32,253 --> 00:44:35,673
<i>There's Archimedes,</i>
<i>and I think he's had an idea!</i>

783
00:44:35,714 --> 00:44:38,676
Eureka!

784
00:44:38,717 --> 00:44:42,514
<i>Archimedes out to Socrates,</i>
<i>Socrates back to Archimedes,</i>

785
00:44:42,555 --> 00:44:45,183
<i>Archimedes out to Herakleitos,</i>
<i>he beats Hegel,</i>

786
00:44:45,224 --> 00:44:47,935
<i>Herakleitos, a little flick,</i>
<i>here he comes on the far post,</i>

787
00:44:47,977 --> 00:44:50,062
<i>Socrates is there!</i>
<i>Socrates heads it in!</i>

788
00:44:50,104 --> 00:44:52,023
<i>Socrates has scored!</i>

789
00:44:52,064 --> 00:44:53,858
<i>The Greeks are going mad!</i>

790
00:44:53,899 --> 00:44:55,568
<i>The Greeks are going mad,</i>
<i>Socrates scores,</i>

791
00:44:55,610 --> 00:44:56,986
<i>what a beautiful pass</i>
<i>from Archimedes!</i>

792
00:44:57,028 --> 00:44:58,446
<i>The Germans are disputing it.</i>

793
00:44:58,488 --> 00:45:00,532
<i>Hegel is arguing that</i>
<i>the reality</i>

794
00:45:00,573 --> 00:45:02,825
<i>is merely an</i> a priori<i> adjunct</i>
<i>of non-naturalistic ethics;</i>

795
00:45:02,867 --> 00:45:04,369
<i>Kant,</i>
<i>via the categorical imperative,</i>

796
00:45:04,410 --> 00:45:05,995
<i>is holding that,</i>
<i>ontologically</i>

797
00:45:06,037 --> 00:45:07,497
<i>it exists only</i>
<i>in the imagination,</i>

798
00:45:07,539 --> 00:45:09,415
<i>and Marx is claiming</i>
<i>it was offside.</i>

799
00:45:09,457 --> 00:45:11,250
<i>But Confucius has answered them</i>
<i>with the final whistle!</i>

800
00:45:11,292 --> 00:45:13,127
<i>It's all over!</i>

801
00:45:13,169 --> 00:45:15,171
<i>Germany, having trounced</i>
<i>England's famous midfield trio</i>

802
00:45:15,213 --> 00:45:16,922
<i>of Bentham, Locke and Hobbes</i>
<i>in the semi-final,</i>

803
00:45:16,964 --> 00:45:18,715
<i>have been beaten</i>
<i>by the odd goal,</i>

804
00:45:18,757 --> 00:45:20,092
<i>and let's see it again.</i>

805
00:45:21,177 --> 00:45:22,970
<i>There it is, Socrates--</i>

806
00:45:23,012 --> 00:45:25,056
<i>Socrates heads in and</i>
<i>Leibniz doesn't have a chance.</i>

807
00:45:25,097 --> 00:45:28,100
<i>And just look at those</i>
<i>delighted Greeks.</i>

808
00:45:28,142 --> 00:45:30,727
<i>There they are,</i>
<i>"Chopper" Sophocles,</i>

809
00:45:30,769 --> 00:45:34,106
<i>Empedokles of Acragus,</i>
<i>what a game he had.</i>

810
00:45:34,148 --> 00:45:37,276
<i>And Epikuros is there,</i>
<i>and Socrates, the captain,</i>

811
00:45:37,318 --> 00:45:40,363
<i>who scored what was probably</i>
<i>the most important goal</i>

812
00:45:40,405 --> 00:45:41,656
<i>of his career.</i>

813
00:45:52,542 --> 00:45:54,960
Good afternoon, sir.
May I help you?

814
00:45:55,002 --> 00:45:57,463
Yes, I'd like to have
an argument, please.

815
00:46:02,552 --> 00:46:05,430
Certainly, sir.
Have you been here before?

816
00:46:05,471 --> 00:46:07,139
No, this is my first time.

817
00:46:07,181 --> 00:46:10,309
I see. Well, do you want
to have just one argument

818
00:46:10,351 --> 00:46:12,478
or were you thinking
of taking a course?

819
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:14,480
Well, what is the cost?

820
00:46:14,522 --> 00:46:17,692
Yes, it's one pound
for a five-minute argument,

821
00:46:17,734 --> 00:46:20,612
but only eight pounds
for a course of ten.

822
00:46:20,653 --> 00:46:22,113
Well,
I think I'll just try the one

823
00:46:22,154 --> 00:46:23,656
and see how it goes from there.

824
00:46:23,698 --> 00:46:27,326
Fine. Ah, yes,
try Mr. Barnard, Room 12.

825
00:46:27,368 --> 00:46:28,785
Thank you very much.

826
00:46:32,749 --> 00:46:34,417
-What do you want?
-Well, I was told outside--

827
00:46:34,459 --> 00:46:35,960
Don't give me that,

828
00:46:36,001 --> 00:46:37,295
you snotty-faced heap
of parrot droppings!

829
00:46:37,336 --> 00:46:38,463
What?!

830
00:46:38,504 --> 00:46:40,298
Shut your festering gob,
you tit!

831
00:46:40,339 --> 00:46:42,007
Your type make me puke,

832
00:46:42,049 --> 00:46:44,636
you vacuous, toffee-nosed,
malodorous pervert!

833
00:46:44,677 --> 00:46:46,137
Listen,
I came here for an argument!

834
00:46:46,178 --> 00:46:48,723
Oh, oh, I'm sorry,
but this is Abuse!

835
00:46:48,765 --> 00:46:51,309
Oh, oh, I see!
Terribly sorry.

836
00:46:51,350 --> 00:46:53,227
No, you want Room 12A,
next door.

837
00:46:53,269 --> 00:46:55,062
Oh, I see. Thank you very much.

838
00:46:55,104 --> 00:46:56,481
Not at all.

839
00:46:57,856 --> 00:46:59,275
Stupid git.

840
00:47:01,569 --> 00:47:04,863
Is this the right room
for an argument?

841
00:47:04,905 --> 00:47:07,116
I've told you once.

842
00:47:07,158 --> 00:47:08,284
No, you haven't.

843
00:47:08,326 --> 00:47:09,452
-Yes, I have.
-When?

844
00:47:09,494 --> 00:47:11,370
-Just now.
-No, you didn't.

845
00:47:11,412 --> 00:47:12,705
-Yes, I did.
-You didn't!

846
00:47:12,747 --> 00:47:14,373
-I did.
-No, you didn't!

847
00:47:14,415 --> 00:47:15,874
-I'm telling you I did!
-You most certainly did not!

848
00:47:15,916 --> 00:47:16,875
One moment,
is this the five-minute argument

849
00:47:16,917 --> 00:47:18,210
or the full half hour?

850
00:47:18,252 --> 00:47:19,712
Oh, oh, I see.
Just the five minutes.

851
00:47:19,754 --> 00:47:22,381
Just the five minutes...
Right, thank you.

852
00:47:23,633 --> 00:47:25,468
-Anyway, I did.
-Oh, no, you didn't.

853
00:47:25,510 --> 00:47:27,052
Now let's get one thing
absolutely clear.

854
00:47:27,094 --> 00:47:28,971
-I most definitely told you.
-No, you didn't.

855
00:47:29,013 --> 00:47:30,431
-Yes, I did.
-No, you didn't.

856
00:47:30,473 --> 00:47:32,308
-Yes, I did.
-No, you didn't.

857
00:47:32,350 --> 00:47:37,104
-Yes, I did. Yes, I did...
-No you didn't. No you didn't...

858
00:47:37,146 --> 00:47:39,064
Oh, look,
this isn't an argument!

859
00:47:39,106 --> 00:47:40,941
Yes, it is!
No, it isn't!

860
00:47:40,983 --> 00:47:42,777
-It's just contradiction!
-No, it isn't!

861
00:47:42,819 --> 00:47:44,320
-It is!
-It is not!

862
00:47:44,362 --> 00:47:45,780
-You just contradicted me!
-I did not!

863
00:47:45,822 --> 00:47:47,323
-You did!
-No, no, no!

864
00:47:47,365 --> 00:47:48,449
-You did just then!
-Nonsense!

865
00:47:48,491 --> 00:47:50,576
Oh, this is futile!

866
00:47:50,618 --> 00:47:52,787
-No, it isn't.
-Yes, it is.

867
00:47:53,870 --> 00:47:55,373
I came here for a good argument.

868
00:47:55,414 --> 00:47:57,166
No, you didn't.
You came here for an argument.

869
00:47:57,208 --> 00:47:58,543
Yes, but argument
isn't just contradiction!

870
00:47:58,584 --> 00:48:00,252
Well, can be.

871
00:48:00,294 --> 00:48:02,296
No, an argument is a connected
series of statements

872
00:48:02,338 --> 00:48:03,589
intended to establish
a proposition.

873
00:48:03,631 --> 00:48:05,257
-No, it isn't!
-Yes, it is!

874
00:48:05,299 --> 00:48:06,467
It isn't just contradiction!

875
00:48:06,509 --> 00:48:08,469
Look, if I argue with you,

876
00:48:08,511 --> 00:48:11,096
I must take up
a contrary position.

877
00:48:11,138 --> 00:48:12,807
Yes, but that isn't just saying,
"No, it isn't!"

878
00:48:12,849 --> 00:48:14,809
-Yes, it is!
-No, it isn't!

879
00:48:14,851 --> 00:48:16,644
-Yes, it is! Yes, it is...
-No, it isn't! No, it isn't...

880
00:48:16,686 --> 00:48:18,479
Argument
is an intellectual process.

881
00:48:18,521 --> 00:48:20,897
Contradiction is just
an automatic gain-saying

882
00:48:20,939 --> 00:48:22,149
of anything
the other person says!

883
00:48:22,191 --> 00:48:23,484
-It is not!
-It is!

884
00:48:23,526 --> 00:48:24,694
-Not at all!
-Now look--

885
00:48:24,736 --> 00:48:26,070
Thank you! Good morning!

886
00:48:27,988 --> 00:48:29,240
What?

887
00:48:30,324 --> 00:48:31,992
That's it! Good morning!

888
00:48:32,034 --> 00:48:33,285
I was just getting interested!

889
00:48:33,327 --> 00:48:35,496
I'm sorry,
the five minutes is up!

890
00:48:35,538 --> 00:48:37,164
That was never five minutes,
just now!

891
00:48:37,206 --> 00:48:39,250
-I'm afraid it was.
-Oh, no, it wasn't.

892
00:48:42,712 --> 00:48:45,381
I'm sorry, I'm... I'm not
allowed to argue anymore.

893
00:48:45,423 --> 00:48:47,132
-What?
-If you want me to go on arguing

894
00:48:47,174 --> 00:48:49,218
you'll have to pay
for another five minutes.

895
00:48:49,260 --> 00:48:51,387
But that was never five minutes,
just now!

896
00:48:54,181 --> 00:48:58,310
Oh, come on!
Oh, this is ridiculous!

897
00:48:58,352 --> 00:48:59,978
If you want me to go on arguing,

898
00:49:00,020 --> 00:49:01,564
you'll have to pay
for another five minutes!

899
00:49:02,648 --> 00:49:05,984
Oh, all right. Here you are.

900
00:49:07,069 --> 00:49:08,404
Thank you.

901
00:49:09,572 --> 00:49:11,073
Well?

902
00:49:12,491 --> 00:49:13,992
Well what?

903
00:49:14,034 --> 00:49:15,578
That was never five minutes,
just now!

904
00:49:15,620 --> 00:49:17,246
I told you,
if you want me to go on arguing,

905
00:49:17,288 --> 00:49:18,623
you'll have to pay
for another five minutes.

906
00:49:18,664 --> 00:49:20,750
Yes, yes, well, I've just paid!

907
00:49:20,792 --> 00:49:22,543
No, you didn't!

908
00:49:22,585 --> 00:49:24,044
-I did!
-You did not!

909
00:49:24,086 --> 00:49:26,839
-I did!
-You never...

910
00:49:26,881 --> 00:49:28,466
Look, I don't want to argue
about this.

911
00:49:28,507 --> 00:49:30,259
Well, I'm very sorry,
but you didn't pay!

912
00:49:30,301 --> 00:49:34,096
Aha! But if I didn't pay,
why are you arguing?

913
00:49:34,138 --> 00:49:37,558
Aha! Got you!

914
00:49:41,729 --> 00:49:43,439
-No, you haven't.
-Yes, I have.

915
00:49:43,481 --> 00:49:45,858
If you're arguing,
I must have paid.

916
00:49:45,900 --> 00:49:49,361
Not necessarily. I could be
arguing in my spare time.

917
00:49:49,403 --> 00:49:51,447
-Oh, I've had enough of this!
-No, you haven't!

918
00:49:51,489 --> 00:49:52,907
Yes, I have!

919
00:49:52,949 --> 00:49:56,993
-No, you haven't...
-Yes, I have...

-Good morning.
-Oh, good morning.

952
00:54:13,834 --> 00:54:16,045
Have you come to arrange
a holiday

953
00:54:16,087 --> 00:54:17,713
or would you like a blow job?

954
00:54:21,550 --> 00:54:23,094
I'm sorry?

955
00:54:23,135 --> 00:54:25,804
Oh, you've come
to arrange a holiday?

956
00:54:25,846 --> 00:54:29,100
-Yes.
-Oh, sorry, sorry.

957
00:54:29,141 --> 00:54:33,229
Now, where were you
thinking of going?

958
00:54:33,269 --> 00:54:34,646
To India.

959
00:54:34,688 --> 00:54:36,857
One of our adventure
holidays.

960
00:54:36,899 --> 00:54:38,483
Yes, that's right.

961
00:54:38,525 --> 00:54:40,402
Well, you'd better see
Mr. Bounder about that.

962
00:54:40,444 --> 00:54:42,571
Mr. Bounder,
this gentleman is interested

963
00:54:42,613 --> 00:54:46,282
in the "India Overland".
And nothing else.

964
00:54:52,539 --> 00:54:54,332
Hello, I'm Bounder of Adventure.

965
00:54:54,374 --> 00:54:56,501
Oh, hello.
My name is Smoketoomuch.

966
00:54:56,543 --> 00:54:57,962
What?

967
00:54:58,003 --> 00:55:00,714
My name is Smoketoomuch.
Mr. Smoketoomuch.

968
00:55:00,756 --> 00:55:03,467
Well, you'd better
cut down a little then.

969
00:55:08,304 --> 00:55:09,681
I'm sorry?

970
00:55:09,723 --> 00:55:13,018
You'd better
cut down a little then.

971
00:55:14,478 --> 00:55:16,855
Oh, I see! Smoke too much

972
00:55:16,897 --> 00:55:18,607
so I'd better cut down
a little then!

973
00:55:18,649 --> 00:55:20,609
Yes.

974
00:55:20,651 --> 00:55:22,194
I expect you get people making

975
00:55:22,236 --> 00:55:24,488
jokes about your name
all the time, eh?

976
00:55:24,529 --> 00:55:28,993
No, actually, it never struck me
before. Smoketoomuch...

977
00:55:32,913 --> 00:55:35,540
Anyway, you're interested
in one of our holidays, are you?

978
00:55:35,582 --> 00:55:37,209
Yes, that's right.

979
00:55:37,251 --> 00:55:39,295
I saw your advert
in the blassified ads.

980
00:55:39,335 --> 00:55:42,422
-The what?
-In<i> The Times Blassified Ads.</i>

981
00:55:42,464 --> 00:55:45,050
<i>The Times Classified Ads?</i>

982
00:55:45,092 --> 00:55:46,718
Yes, that's right.

983
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:48,179
I'm afraid I have
a speech impediment.

984
00:55:48,220 --> 00:55:50,306
I can't pronounce the letter B.

985
00:55:50,346 --> 00:55:52,891
-C?
-Yes, that's right, B.

986
00:55:54,268 --> 00:55:56,020
It's all due to a trauma
I suffered

987
00:55:56,061 --> 00:55:57,646
when I was a sbhoolboy.

988
00:55:57,688 --> 00:56:00,565
I was attacked by a Siamese bat.

989
00:56:00,607 --> 00:56:02,193
A Siamese cat.

990
00:56:02,234 --> 00:56:06,488
No, a Siamese bat.
They're more dangerous.

991
00:56:06,530 --> 00:56:10,284
Well, listen...
can you say the letter K?

992
00:56:10,326 --> 00:56:16,748
Oh, yes. Khaki, kettle, Kipling,
Khomeini, Kellogg's Born Flakes.

993
00:56:16,790 --> 00:56:19,668
Well, why don't you say
the letter K

994
00:56:19,710 --> 00:56:21,795
instead of the letter C?

995
00:56:21,837 --> 00:56:25,674
Well, you mean,
pronounce "blassified" with a K?

996
00:56:25,716 --> 00:56:27,176
Yes, absolutely!

997
00:56:28,260 --> 00:56:30,804
-Klassified!
-Good!

998
00:56:30,846 --> 00:56:32,931
Oh, it's very good!
I never thought of that before.

999
00:56:34,474 --> 00:56:36,060
What a silly bunt.

1000
00:56:38,687 --> 00:56:41,815
Now then,
about the holiday...

1001
00:56:41,857 --> 00:56:44,735
Yes, well, I've been on
package tours many times before,

1002
00:56:44,776 --> 00:56:46,695
so your advert
really baught my eye.

1003
00:56:46,737 --> 00:56:48,780
Good, good, jolly good,
well what we offer is this...

1004
00:56:48,822 --> 00:56:50,782
You're quite right, what's
the point of going abroad,

1005
00:56:50,824 --> 00:56:52,492
if you're just going to be
treated like a sheep?

1006
00:56:52,534 --> 00:56:53,952
Carted around in buses,
surrounded by sweaty,

1007
00:56:53,994 --> 00:56:55,704
mindless oaves
from Kettering and Boventry.

1008
00:56:55,746 --> 00:56:57,373
-Absolutely.
-Their bloth baps

1009
00:56:57,413 --> 00:56:58,957
and their bardigans
and their transistor radios,

1010
00:56:58,999 --> 00:57:00,458
bomplaining about the tea:

1011
00:57:00,500 --> 00:57:02,211
"They don't make it properly,
do they?"

1012
00:57:02,253 --> 00:57:03,921
And stopping at endless
Majorcan bodegas

1013
00:57:03,962 --> 00:57:06,048
selling fish and chips
and Watney's Red Barrel

1014
00:57:06,090 --> 00:57:08,050
and calamaris and two veg.

1015
00:57:08,092 --> 00:57:09,968
And sitting in their
cotton sun frocks,

1016
00:57:10,010 --> 00:57:11,803
squirting Timothy Whites
sun cream

1017
00:57:11,845 --> 00:57:14,681
all over their puffy,
raw, swollen, purulent flesh,

1018
00:57:14,723 --> 00:57:16,516
'cos they overdid it
on the first day.

1019
00:57:16,558 --> 00:57:18,394
Yes, I know just what you mean!
Now, what we offer is--

1020
00:57:18,435 --> 00:57:21,063
And being herded into endless
Hotel Miramars and Bellevueses,

1021
00:57:21,105 --> 00:57:23,357
Bontinentals
with their international luxury

1022
00:57:23,399 --> 00:57:25,109
-modern roomettes...
-Oh, yes.

1023
00:57:25,150 --> 00:57:26,735
...and swimming pools
full of draught Red Barrel

1024
00:57:26,777 --> 00:57:28,486
and fat German businessmen,

1025
00:57:28,528 --> 00:57:30,572
pretending to be acrobats
and forming pyramids

1026
00:57:30,614 --> 00:57:33,200
and frightening the children
and barging into the queues.

1027
00:57:33,242 --> 00:57:34,910
And if you're not at your table
spot on seven,

1028
00:57:34,952 --> 00:57:37,246
you miss your bowl of Campbell's
Cream of Mushroom Soup,

1029
00:57:37,288 --> 00:57:39,998
the first item in the menu
of International Cuisine.

1030
00:57:40,040 --> 00:57:41,875
Absolutely. Now--

1031
00:57:41,917 --> 00:57:44,002
Every Thursday night there's
bloody cabaret in the bar

1032
00:57:44,044 --> 00:57:47,631
featuring some tiny, emaciated
dago with nine-inch hips

1033
00:57:47,672 --> 00:57:50,592
and some fat, bloated tart
with her hair Brylcreemed down

1034
00:57:50,634 --> 00:57:52,803
and big ass, presenting
Flamenco for Foreigners.

1035
00:57:52,844 --> 00:57:54,263
Will you be quiet, please?

1036
00:57:54,305 --> 00:57:56,056
And adenoidal typists
from Birmingham

1037
00:57:56,098 --> 00:57:57,641
-with flabby white legs...
-Will you be quiet?

1038
00:57:57,682 --> 00:57:58,767
...and diarrhea,
trying to pick up hairy,

1039
00:57:58,809 --> 00:58:00,227
bandy-legged, wop waiters

1040
00:58:00,269 --> 00:58:01,645
-called Manuel.
-Be quiet!

1041
00:58:01,686 --> 00:58:03,314
And once a week
there's an excursion

1042
00:58:03,355 --> 00:58:05,107
to local Roman remains,
where you can buy Cherryade

1043
00:58:05,149 --> 00:58:06,691
-and melted ice cream...
-Will you be quiet?

1044
00:58:06,733 --> 00:58:08,444
...and bleedin'
Watney's Red Barrel.

1045
00:58:08,485 --> 00:58:09,778
-Shut up!
-And one night they take you

1046
00:58:09,820 --> 00:58:11,280
to a typical restaurant
with local...

1047
00:58:11,322 --> 00:58:13,031
-Shut up!
-...atmosphere and color,

1048
00:58:13,073 --> 00:58:14,908
-and you sit next to a...
-Shut up!

1049
00:58:14,950 --> 00:58:16,201
...party of people from Rhyl
who keep singing:

1050
00:58:16,243 --> 00:58:17,535
<i>I love the Costa Brava!</i>

1051
00:58:17,577 --> 00:58:18,662
Shut up!

1052
00:58:18,703 --> 00:58:20,831
<i>I love the Costa Brava!</i>

1053
00:58:20,872 --> 00:58:23,417
And you get cornered by some
drunken greengrocer from Luton

1054
00:58:23,459 --> 00:58:26,920
with an Instamatic camera and
last Tuesday's<i> Daily Express...</i>

1055
00:58:26,962 --> 00:58:28,755
Please be quiet!
This is the last time...

1056
00:58:28,797 --> 00:58:30,424
...and he drones on and on
and on about how Ian Smith

1057
00:58:30,466 --> 00:58:32,009
should be running the country

1058
00:58:32,050 --> 00:58:33,677
and how many languages
Margaret Powell can speak,

1059
00:58:33,718 --> 00:58:35,887
and then she throws up
all over the<i> cuba libres.</i>

1060
00:58:35,929 --> 00:58:38,723
And spending four days
on the tarmac at Luton Airport

1061
00:58:38,765 --> 00:58:40,642
on a five-day package tour

1062
00:58:40,684 --> 00:58:42,353
with nothing to eat but dry
British Airways-type sandwiches.

1063
00:58:42,394 --> 00:58:44,062
Shut up! Please shut up!

1064
00:58:44,104 --> 00:58:46,023
You can't even get a glass
of Watney's Red Barrel

1065
00:58:46,064 --> 00:58:47,524
because you're still in England
and the bloody bar closes

1066
00:58:47,565 --> 00:58:49,318
every time you're thirsty.

1067
00:58:49,360 --> 00:58:50,694
And the kids are crying
and vomiting

1068
00:58:50,735 --> 00:58:52,488
and breaking
the plastic ashtrays.

1069
00:58:52,529 --> 00:58:54,448
They keep telling you
it'll only be another hour,

1070
00:58:54,490 --> 00:58:56,908
but you know damn well
your plane is still in Iceland,

1071
00:58:56,950 --> 00:58:58,576
and has to come back
and take a party of...

1072
00:58:58,618 --> 00:59:00,078
-Shut up!
-...take a party of Swedes

1073
00:59:00,120 --> 00:59:01,913
to Yugoslavia,

1074
00:59:01,955 --> 00:59:03,832
before it can load you up
at 3 a.m. in the morning.

1075
00:59:03,874 --> 00:59:05,876
And then you sit on the tarmac
for four hours

1076
00:59:05,917 --> 00:59:07,794
because of unforeseen
difficulties,

1077
00:59:07,836 --> 00:59:11,382
i.e. the permanent strike of
air traffic control over Paris.

1078
00:59:11,423 --> 00:59:13,175
When you finally
get to Malaga airport,

1079
00:59:13,217 --> 00:59:15,511
everybody's queueing
for the bloody toilet,

1080
00:59:15,552 --> 00:59:17,929
and queuing for the bloody
armed customs officers,

1081
00:59:17,971 --> 00:59:20,140
and queuing for the bloody bus
that isn't there,

1082
00:59:20,182 --> 00:59:23,060
waiting to take you to the hotel
that hasn't yet been built.

1083
00:59:23,101 --> 00:59:25,770
When you finally get to
the half-built Algerian ruin

1084
00:59:25,812 --> 00:59:27,564
called the Hotel del Sol,

1085
00:59:27,605 --> 00:59:29,274
by paying
half your holiday money

1086
00:59:29,316 --> 00:59:31,360
to a licensed bandit in a taxi,

1087
00:59:31,402 --> 00:59:34,196
there's no water in the pool,
there's no water in the bog,

1088
00:59:34,238 --> 00:59:35,739
there's no water in the tap,

1089
00:59:35,780 --> 00:59:37,574
there's only a bleeding lizard
in the bidet,

1090
00:59:37,615 --> 00:59:39,617
and half the rooms
are double-booked,

1091
00:59:39,659 --> 00:59:40,994
and you can't sleep anyway,

1092
00:59:41,036 --> 00:59:42,620
'cause of the permanent
24-hour drilling

1093
00:59:42,662 --> 00:59:44,581
of the foundations
of the hotel next door.

1094
00:59:44,622 --> 00:59:46,791
Meanwhile, the Spanish
National Tourist Board

1095
00:59:46,833 --> 00:59:49,253
promises you
the raging cholera epidemic

1096
00:59:49,294 --> 00:59:52,005
is merely a mild outbreak
of Spanish Tummy,

1097
00:59:52,047 --> 00:59:54,466
rather like the previous
outbreak in 1616

1098
00:59:54,508 --> 00:59:56,510
even the bloody rats
are dying from it!

1099
00:59:58,887 --> 01:00:03,183
As early
as the late 14th century,

1100
01:00:03,225 --> 01:00:06,478
or indeed as late
as the early 14th century,

1101
01:00:06,520 --> 01:00:08,813
the earliest forms of jape
were divisible in--

1102
01:00:08,855 --> 01:00:11,858
Meanwhile, the bloody Guardia
are busy arresting 16-year-olds

1103
01:00:11,900 --> 01:00:13,610
for kissing in the streets.

1104
01:00:13,651 --> 01:00:15,987
And finally, on the last day
in the airport lounge,

1105
01:00:16,029 --> 01:00:18,490
everybody's buying little
awful horrid donkeys

1106
01:00:18,532 --> 01:00:20,075
with their names on,

1107
01:00:20,117 --> 01:00:22,035
and bullfight posters
with their own names on,

1108
01:00:22,077 --> 01:00:23,745
like Antonio--

1109
01:00:23,787 --> 01:00:25,539
Mr. Brian Pules of Norwich.

1110
01:00:25,581 --> 01:00:27,958
And then finally,
when you get to bloody Luton,

1111
01:00:27,999 --> 01:00:30,710
you're kept around
for another four hours,

1112
01:00:30,752 --> 01:00:33,755
while they find a plane that can
take you back to Manchester.

1113
01:00:33,797 --> 01:00:36,049
And when you finally
get to Manchester,

1114
01:00:36,091 --> 01:00:39,886
there's only another bloody bus
you have to wait 16 hours for...

1115
01:00:44,224 --> 01:00:47,269
As early as
the late 14th century

1116
01:00:47,311 --> 01:00:50,522
or indeed as late
as the early 14th century,

1117
01:00:50,564 --> 01:00:52,107
the earliest forms of jape

1118
01:00:52,149 --> 01:00:54,151
were divisible
into the two categories

1119
01:00:54,192 --> 01:00:57,028
into which I now intend
to divide them.

1120
01:00:57,070 --> 01:00:58,696
The earliest manifestation

1121
01:00:58,738 --> 01:01:00,782
of the basic,
simple precipitation jest

1122
01:01:00,824 --> 01:01:03,660
incurred, as will be seen
from the demonstration,

1123
01:01:03,701 --> 01:01:07,205
a disproportionate amount
of internal risibility

1124
01:01:07,247 --> 01:01:09,458
on the part of the operator.

1125
01:01:28,685 --> 01:01:30,646
Secondary precipitation occurs

1126
01:01:30,687 --> 01:01:34,732
when both protagonist and dupe
are located indoors.

1127
01:01:34,774 --> 01:01:37,027
It is true, however,
that this has involved

1128
01:01:37,068 --> 01:01:40,905
the development of a special
piece of machinery.

1129
01:01:40,947 --> 01:01:43,950
But it is still no more
than a simple variation

1130
01:01:43,992 --> 01:01:45,952
of primary precipitation.

1131
01:02:09,267 --> 01:02:12,396
The opening up
of the African continent

1132
01:02:12,437 --> 01:02:14,898
revealed a vast
new source of wealth

1133
01:02:14,939 --> 01:02:16,983
for humorous exploitation.

1134
01:02:18,235 --> 01:02:20,487
We are to see demonstrated

1135
01:02:20,529 --> 01:02:24,658
how this was adapted
to the basic precipitation jape.

1136
01:03:05,365 --> 01:03:08,034
We now come on to a considera--

1137
01:03:35,479 --> 01:03:39,023
We now come on
to a consideration

1138
01:03:39,065 --> 01:03:42,819
of the more sophisticated
transitive mode of japing,

1139
01:03:42,860 --> 01:03:44,613
in which,
as you will observe,

1140
01:03:44,655 --> 01:03:48,784
the operator or inceptor
remains totally unaware

1141
01:03:48,825 --> 01:03:51,995
of the humorous implications
of his action.

1142
01:03:58,627 --> 01:04:04,800
First, we are to see the
"simple sideswipe" or "whop."

1143
01:04:06,217 --> 01:04:08,094
Hey, Vance!

1144
01:04:16,812 --> 01:04:21,232
Next, the "sideswipe
and return."

1145
01:04:21,274 --> 01:04:23,527
Hey, Vance!

1146
01:04:34,204 --> 01:04:38,916
And now, the "double
sideswipe and return."

1147
01:04:45,674 --> 01:04:47,258
Hey, Vance!

1148
01:05:02,524 --> 01:05:05,694
Popular as this jest
has always been, however,

1149
01:05:05,736 --> 01:05:08,279
it cannot compare
with the ribald connotations

1150
01:05:08,321 --> 01:05:12,200
associated with the dispatch
of an edible missile.

1151
01:05:21,376 --> 01:05:23,378
First...

1152
01:05:23,420 --> 01:05:28,132
First the simple straightforward
"offensive deposit."

1153
01:05:44,107 --> 01:05:46,109
Second...

1154
01:05:46,150 --> 01:05:50,238
Second, the simple
"sideways offensive deposit."

1155
01:06:01,917 --> 01:06:05,629
Next, the simple
"surprise deposit."

1156
01:06:24,940 --> 01:06:27,943
And now, the "foul pie."

1157
01:06:39,830 --> 01:06:42,081
Could we have new pies, please?

1158
01:07:01,810 --> 01:07:03,394
Finally...

1159
01:07:03,436 --> 01:07:05,647
Finally we move on
to the interesting,

1160
01:07:05,689 --> 01:07:07,607
but little-known variant,

1161
01:07:07,649 --> 01:07:11,611
nominally designated
the "three-course complex."

1162
01:07:32,549 --> 01:07:36,553
But... but finally,
we must not forget

1163
01:07:36,594 --> 01:07:38,847
the enjoyment, the satisfaction,

1164
01:07:38,889 --> 01:07:41,516
and the edification
to be derived

1165
01:07:41,558 --> 01:07:43,434
from the simple, straightforward

1166
01:07:43,476 --> 01:07:48,523
"sideways completely
unexpected deposit."

1167
01:07:57,657 --> 01:08:02,412
<i>Once upon a time, there was a</i>
<i>little house in a dark forest.</i>

1168
01:08:02,453 --> 01:08:07,000
<i>In this house lived a humble</i>
<i>woodcutter and his wife</i>

1169
01:08:11,295 --> 01:08:14,925
<i>and their pretty daughter,</i>
<i>Little Red Riding Hood.</i>

1170
01:08:29,355 --> 01:08:31,649
<i>And in the middle of this deep,</i>
<i>dark forest,</i>

1171
01:08:31,691 --> 01:08:33,777
<i>there lived a vicious wolf!</i>

1172
01:08:41,451 --> 01:08:44,871
<i>One day, Little Red Riding Hood</i>
<i>set off to take some things</i>

1173
01:08:44,913 --> 01:08:49,208
<i>to her old grandmother</i>
<i>who lived deep in the forest.</i>

1174
01:09:04,682 --> 01:09:07,644
<i>The vicious wolf</i>
<i>saw Little Red Riding Hood</i>

1175
01:09:07,685 --> 01:09:12,440
<i>and thought:</i>
<i>"She looks very good to eat!"</i>

1176
01:09:14,901 --> 01:09:18,989
<i>"Where are you going,</i>
<i>my pretty one?"</i>

1177
01:09:20,448 --> 01:09:23,326
<i>"Oh, kind sir,</i>
<i>to my grandmother's."</i>

1178
01:09:23,367 --> 01:09:27,288
<i>"Ha, ha, ha, ha!"</i>
<i>smirked the wicked wolf</i>

1179
01:09:27,330 --> 01:09:30,875
<i>and dashed off through the</i>
<i>forest to grandmother's house.</i>

1180
01:09:33,461 --> 01:09:37,423
<i>"Knock, knock, knock,"</i>
<i>went the wicked wolf.</i>

1181
01:09:37,465 --> 01:09:39,092
<i>The door opened wide,</i>

1182
01:09:39,134 --> 01:09:41,427
<i>but it wasn't Grandmother</i>
<i>who opened it.</i>

1183
01:09:41,469 --> 01:09:45,807
<i>It was Buzz Aldrin,</i>
<i>America's number two spaceman!</i>

1184
01:09:48,225 --> 01:09:50,770
<i>For this was not</i>
<i>Granny's little house at all,</i>

1185
01:09:50,812 --> 01:09:52,480
<i>but the headquarters of NASA,</i>

1186
01:09:52,522 --> 01:09:55,232
<i>the American</i>
<i>space research agency.</i>

1187
01:09:57,318 --> 01:10:00,363
<i>The wicked wolf</i>
<i>was shot by security guards.</i>

1188
01:10:02,866 --> 01:10:06,619
<i>So all was quiet</i>
<i>in the forest again.</i>

1189
01:10:08,705 --> 01:10:10,373
<i>The humble woodcutter</i>
<i>and his wife</i>

1190
01:10:10,414 --> 01:10:12,750
<i>sold the their story</i>
<i>to</i> Der Spiegel

1191
01:10:12,792 --> 01:10:16,462
<i>for 40,000 Deutsche Marks.</i>

1192
01:10:16,504 --> 01:10:19,549
<i>NASA agreed to limit</i>
<i>the number of nuclear tests</i>

1193
01:10:19,590 --> 01:10:21,342
<i>in Granny's little house</i>

1194
01:10:21,384 --> 01:10:25,429
<i>to two on Thursdays</i>
<i>and one on Saturdays after tea.</i>

1195
01:10:32,103 --> 01:10:33,771
Liberal rubbish!

1196
01:10:33,813 --> 01:10:36,566
What do you want
with your jugged fish, Klaus?

1197
01:10:38,526 --> 01:10:41,112
Pardon, my wide-thighed plum?

1198
01:10:41,154 --> 01:10:43,656
What do you want
with your jugged fish,

1199
01:10:43,698 --> 01:10:45,241
you cloth-eared git?

1200
01:10:46,409 --> 01:10:48,119
Halibut!

1201
01:10:48,161 --> 01:10:50,329
The jugged fish is halibut!

1202
01:10:50,371 --> 01:10:55,752
All right. Well, what fish
do you have that is not jugged?

1203
01:10:55,793 --> 01:10:57,087
Rabbit.

1204
01:10:58,213 --> 01:11:00,464
What, rabbit fish?

1205
01:11:00,506 --> 01:11:02,717
Well, it's all covered in fur.

1206
01:11:03,801 --> 01:11:05,302
Well, is it dead?

1207
01:11:05,344 --> 01:11:08,389
Well, it was coughing up blood
last night.

1208
01:11:10,141 --> 01:11:12,977
All right, I'll have the dead,
unjugged rabbit fish.

1209
01:11:16,814 --> 01:11:18,274
Appalling!

1210
01:11:18,315 --> 01:11:20,651
Oh, you're always complaining.

1211
01:11:20,693 --> 01:11:22,278
What's for afterwards?

1212
01:11:22,319 --> 01:11:25,364
Well, there's rat pie,

1213
01:11:25,406 --> 01:11:31,913
rat pudding, rat sorbet
or... strawberry tart.

1214
01:11:31,955 --> 01:11:33,957
Strawberry tart?

1215
01:11:33,998 --> 01:11:36,417
Well, it's got some rat in it.

1216
01:11:38,086 --> 01:11:40,588
How much?

1217
01:11:40,630 --> 01:11:45,093
Six. Rather a lot really.

1218
01:11:45,135 --> 01:11:47,887
I'll have a slice
without so much rat in it.

1219
01:11:54,894 --> 01:11:56,312
Appalling!

1220
01:11:57,772 --> 01:12:01,400
"Moan, moan, moan!"

1221
01:12:01,442 --> 01:12:03,820
-Hello, mum! Hello, dad!
-Hello, son!

1222
01:12:03,861 --> 01:12:06,697
There's a dead bishop
on the landing!

1223
01:12:06,739 --> 01:12:08,658
Where... where's he from?

1224
01:12:08,699 --> 01:12:12,245
-What do you mean?
-What's his diocese?

1225
01:12:12,287 --> 01:12:14,497
Well, he looked a bit
Canterburyish to me.

1226
01:12:14,538 --> 01:12:16,207
I'll go and have a look.

1227
01:12:16,249 --> 01:12:18,293
I dunno who keeps
bringing them in here.

1228
01:12:18,334 --> 01:12:19,877
Well, it's not me.

1229
01:12:19,919 --> 01:12:22,130
I put three out by the trashcans
last week

1230
01:12:22,172 --> 01:12:24,715
and the garbage men
won't touch 'em.

1231
01:12:24,757 --> 01:12:26,676
It's the Bishop of Leicester!

1232
01:12:26,717 --> 01:12:27,969
How do you know?

1233
01:12:28,011 --> 01:12:30,721
Tattooed on the back
of his neck!

1234
01:12:30,763 --> 01:12:32,849
I think I'd better
call the police!

1235
01:12:32,890 --> 01:12:35,601
-Shouldn't you call the church?
-Call the Church Police!

1236
01:12:35,643 --> 01:12:40,731
That's a good idea!
The Church Police!

1237
01:12:44,152 --> 01:12:46,070
'Allo, 'allo, 'allo!

1238
01:13:04,839 --> 01:13:07,758
What's all this then? Amen!

1239
01:13:07,800 --> 01:13:12,305
-Are you the Church Police?
-Oh, yes!

1240
01:13:12,347 --> 01:13:15,474
There's another dead bishop
on the landing, Vicar-Sergeant!

1241
01:13:15,516 --> 01:13:21,189
Detective Parson, madam!
What is he? R.C. or C. of E.?

1242
01:13:21,231 --> 01:13:22,648
How should I know?

1243
01:13:22,690 --> 01:13:24,400
Tattooed on the back
of their neck!

1244
01:13:26,152 --> 01:13:30,614
Here, is that rat tart?

1245
01:13:34,077 --> 01:13:35,370
Yes.

1246
01:13:38,539 --> 01:13:40,666
Disgusting! Right, men!

1247
01:13:40,708 --> 01:13:43,544
The hunt is on.
Let us kneel in prayer.

1248
01:13:44,754 --> 01:13:46,422
Oh, Lord...

1249
01:13:46,463 --> 01:13:49,384
Oh, Lord, we beseech thee,

1250
01:13:49,425 --> 01:13:53,721
tell us who croaked
the Bishop of Leicester.

1251
01:14:06,650 --> 01:14:10,280
<i>The one in the braces,</i>
<i>he done it.</i>

1252
01:14:18,454 --> 01:14:21,165
It's a fair cop,
but society is to blame.

1253
01:14:21,207 --> 01:14:22,875
Right,
we'll arrest them instead!

1254
01:14:22,917 --> 01:14:24,377
Come on, you!

1255
01:14:24,419 --> 01:14:26,670
Are you in society?

1256
01:14:26,712 --> 01:14:28,965
<i>♪ All things bright</i>
<i>and beautiful-- ♪</i>

1257
01:14:29,006 --> 01:14:31,759

I always wanted...

1263
01:14:54,490 --> 01:14:56,075
to be a lumberjack!

1264
01:15:03,540 --> 01:15:05,960
Leaping from tree to tree...

1265
01:15:07,837 --> 01:15:12,008

rivers of British Columbia!

1266
