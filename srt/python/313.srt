-How do you find the vicarage?

514
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:21,160
Yeah. I like tits.

515
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,600
-[YELLS]
-[SHRIEKS]

516
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,440
-Oh, vicar! Vicar!
-Oh, my goodness.

517
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,840
I-- I do beg your pardon.
How dreadful.

518
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:29,200
I-- My first day in my new
parish, I completely lost my--

519
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:30,680
-Yes. Never mind.
-So sorry.

520
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,400
Never mind.

521
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:33,880
Uh, Chivers, send Mary in
with a new gown.

522
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:35,880
-Certainly, milady.
-I do beg your pardon.

523
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:38,400
I-- I'll help you sit down.
I'm-- So sorry.

524
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:41,680
As I was saying,
um, how do you find
the new vicarage?

525
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:43,880
Oh. Oh, yes, c-certainly.
Yes, indeed. Um...

526
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:45,760
I find the-- The
grounds delightful

527
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:48,160
and the servants
most attentive.

528
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:49,720
Uh, particularly
the little serving maid

529
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:52,120
with the great big knockers,
who once she gets going...

530
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:53,960
[GRUNTING]

531
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,880
[SCREAMING]

532
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:59,120
[APPLAUSE]

533
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,920
Well, there we are.

534
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:06,720
Another year has been
too soon,

535
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:09,000
alas, ended.

536
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:12,160
And I think
none more than myself

537
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:14,840
can be happier
at this time

538
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,360
than I... am.
