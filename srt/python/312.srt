Hello.
Here at the Institute,

00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,680
Professor Charles Pasarell,

289
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:15,960
Dr. Peaches Bartkowicz
and myself

290
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,760
have been working
on the theory,

291
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:20,320
originally postulated
by the late Dr. Kramer,

292
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:23,520
that the penguin is
intrinsically more intelligent

293
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:25,600
than the human being.

294
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:27,640
The first thing that
Dr. Kramer came up with

295
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,520
was that
the penguin has

296
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:32,720
a much smaller brain
than the man.

297
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:35,600
This postulate formed
the fundamental basis

298
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:37,080
of all of his thinking

299
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,040

until his death.

[GRUNT]

301
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:43,480
Now, we've taken this theory
one stage further.

302
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:45,680
If we increase
the size of the penguin,

303
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:48,000
until it is the same
height as the man,

304
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:50,560
and then compare
the relative brain sizes,

305
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:53,760
we now find that the penguin's
brain is still smaller.

306
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:55,640
But, and this is the point,

307
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:58,440
it is larger than it was.

308
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,640
For a penguin to have
the same size of brain as a man,

309
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:07,000
the penguin would have to be
over 66-feet high.

310
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,360
This theory has become known
as the "waste-of-time theory,"

were thought to contain

321
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:49,480
an unfair cultural bias
against the penguin.

322
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:51,320

take into account
