five a week.

521
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:53,520
Well, it's only 44 minutes
from the West End
on the train.

522
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:56,320
And it's not too built up,
so you can have a nice garden.

523
00:21:56,360 --> 00:22:00,360
And the people of Epsom
are a very nice class of
person.

524
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,240
Well, here in High Street,
Epsom,

525
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:05,160
there are ample opportunities
for all kinds of
redevelopment.

526
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,920
As you can see behind me now,

527
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:09,600
there are a high number
of low-density consumer units

528
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:12,560
still not fully maximizing
site value.

529
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:14,400
This could be
radically improved

530
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:17,280
by a carefully planned
program of demolition.

531
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:20,120
And of course, most of
the occupants are
elderly folks,

532
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:22,480
so they wouldn't put up
much of a fight.

533
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:24,160
Good afternoon.

534
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:26,080
In fact, there's still
a few minutes to go

535
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:27,640
before the main race
on the card this afternoon,

536
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:29,680
the Queen Victoria Handicap.

537
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:32,160
So let's have a quick word
with the winner of
the last race,

538
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:34,920
one of the season's top
jockeys, Ronnie Mau-Mau.

539
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,080
Good afternoon, Ronnie.

540
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:37,240
Afternoon, Brian.

541
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:39,160
A very fine ride there,
Ronnie.

542
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,760
Well, a fine horse, Brian.
You know, you can't go wrong.

543
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:43,520
Fancy your chances
for the Derby?

544
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:45,560
Oh, very definitely,
very definitely, indeed.

545
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,160
Certainly, Brian.

546
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,920
Well, let's see
if a colleague of yours
agrees.

547
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:51,160
Let's have a word with Desmond
Willet. Afternoon, Des.

548
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:54,040
Afternoon, Brian.
No chance, no chance at all.

549
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:55,880
No, no, I think
you're wrong there, Des.

550
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:58,360
With the right kind of going,
he's going to be in there.

551
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,240
No chance,
there's no chance.

552
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:02,440
Well, in fact, I can see
last season's top jockey,

553
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:03,560
Johnny Knowles.

554
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:04,800
Good afternoon, Johnny.

555
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:06,680
JOHNNY:
Hello, Brian.

556
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:10,080
Uh, could we have a box
for Johnny, please?

557
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:11,360
Thank you.

558
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:12,440
Hello, Brian.

559
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,120
That's better.

560
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:15,560
There you are.
Three very well-known faces

561
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,520
from the racing world.

562
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:19,520
Thanks very much for coming
along this afternoon, lads.

Not at all.

564
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:21,960
And best wishes for the Derby.

565
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,200
Thank you, Brian.

566
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:24,960
Thanks very much.

567
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,680
Well, in fact, I hear
they're ready for us now

568
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,640
at the start of the main race
this afternoon.

569
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:31,440
So let's go right away
and join Peter at the start.

570
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:33,760
PETER:
<i>Well, they're under</i>
<i>starter's orders</i>

571
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:36,840
<i>for this very valuable</i>
<i>Queen Victoria Handicap.</i>

572
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:39,240
<i>And they're off.</i>

573
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:41,360
<i>And Queen Victoria is the</i>
<i>first   to go with a clean</i>
<i>jump off,</i>

574
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:43,560
<i>followed by Queen Victoria,</i>
<i>Queen Victoria</i>

575
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,200
<i>and Queen Victoria.</i>

576
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:46,680
<i>It's Queen Victoria</i>
<i>and Queen Victoria</i>

577
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,360
<i>making the early running</i>
<i>on the inside.</i>

578
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,880
<i>And at the back,</i>
<i>Queen Victoria</i>

579
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:51,800
<i>already a couple lengths</i>
<i>behind the leaders.</i>

580
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:54,280
<i>Queen Victoria now moved up</i>
<i>to challenge Queen Victoria.</i>

581
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:56,240
<i>Queen Victoria</i>
<i>losing ground.</i>

582
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:57,920
<i>Queen Victoria tucked in</i>
<i>neatly on the stand side.</i>

583
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:59,560
<i>Queen Victoria still</i>
<i>the back marker</i>

584
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,320
<i>as they approach</i>
<i>the halfway mark.</i>

585
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:03,120
<i>Making ground,</i>
<i>passing Queen Victoria</i>

586
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:05,200
<i>with Queen Victoria</i>
<i>and Queen Victoria</i>

587
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:07,080
<i>still well placed as they</i>
<i>approach the first fence.</i>

588
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:09,240
<i>And at the first fence</i>
<i>it's Queen Victoria</i>

589
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:11,240
<i>ahead of Queen Victoria,</i>
<i>Queen Victoria in</i>
<i>third place.</i>

590
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:13,400
<i>Queen Victoria in the rear</i>
<i>as they--</i>

591
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,320
Well, a very exciting race
there at Epsom.

592
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,880
And now over to the European
Cup at Barcelona,

593
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:20,040
where the latest news
is that Miguel Otana,

594
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:21,640
the burly Real Madrid striker,

595
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:24,640
was sent off for breaking wind
in the 43rd minute.

596
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:27,400
He'd already been cautioned
for pursing his lips
earlier on

597
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:28,880
and now he's off.

598
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:31,640
So let's see a playback
of that, Brian.

599
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:36,040
Yes. Uh, well, as you can see,
there's Otana now.

600
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:39,640
Uh, he gets the, uh--

601
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:42,200
The through ball from Gomez

602
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:45,360
and, uh, he makes no attempt
to play the ball.

603
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:48,040
He quite deliberately
lets off.

604
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:51,040
And, uh, to my mind,
he was within the box

605
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:53,240
and the referee had no option
whatsoever

606
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:54,840
but to send him off.

607
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,720
Jimmy?
Good evening.

608
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:57,840
What do you make of that?

609
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:59,400
Well, the referees

610
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:01,080
really are clamping down
these days.

611
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:03,920
Only last week, the Belgian
captain was sent off

612
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:06,400
for having a Sony
radio-cassette player.

613
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:09,680
And Gonerelli,
that huge Italian defender,

614
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:13,160
was sent off in Turin for
having his sitting and
dining room

615
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,800
knocked through
to form an open living area.

616
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:17,400

Good evening.

00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:18,880
