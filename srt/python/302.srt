13

21
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:06,600
<i>Mr. Norris had noticed</i>
<i>three things.</i>

22
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:09,360
<i>Firstly, the similarity</i>
<i>of houses.</i>

23
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:11,800
<i>Secondly, the similarity</i>
<i>of costume</i>

24

<i>between Hounslow and Surbiton.</i>

25
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:16,600

81

<i>At this stage,</i>
<i>Mr. Norris was faced</i>

82
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,000
<i>with two major</i>
<i>divergent theories</i>

83
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:34,360
<i>concerning his</i>
<i>Surbiton ancestors.</i>

84

<i>Did they take</i>
<i>the Kingston bypass,</i>

85

<i>turning left at Barnes</i>

86
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:40,320
<i>or did they strike west</i>
<i>up the A308</i>

87
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,760
<i>via Norbiton to Hampton Wick?</i>

88
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:46,960

<i>spotted something.</i>

on<i> How To Do It</i>

169
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:34,520
we're going to show you
how to play the flute,

170
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,400
how to split an atom,

171
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:39,440
how to construct
a box-girder bridge,

172
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:42,200
how to irrigate
the Sahara desert

173
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:45,760
and make vast new areas
of land cultivatable.

174
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,680
But first, here's Jackie

175
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,480
to tell you all
how to rid the world

176
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,000
of all known diseases.

177
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,320
Hello, Alan.

178
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,760
Hello, Jackie.

179
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:56,480
Well, first of all,
become a doctor

180
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:58,480
and discover a marvelous cure
for something.

181
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:01,720
When the medical profession
starts to take notice of you

182
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:03,280
you can tell them what to do,

183
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:05,120
make sure they get
everything right

184
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:07,680
so there'll never be
any diseases ever again.

185
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:10,000
Thanks, Jackie.
Great idea.

186
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,520
And now,
how to play the flute.

187
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,520
Well, here we are.

188
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:17,640
You blow there and you move
your fingers up and down here.

189
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,400
Great. Great. Great, Alan.

190
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,480
Well, next week
we'll be showing you

191
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:24,040
how black and white people
can live together

192
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,440
in peace and harmony.

193
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,400
And Alan will be over in
Moscow

194
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:30,480
showing us how to reconcile
the Russians and the Chinese.

195
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:33,280
So, until next week, cheerio.

196

Oh, yes, he's such a clever
little boy.

201
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:45,920
Just like his father.

202
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,720
Oh, do you think so,

Oh, yes. Spitting image.

00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:54,440
Good afternoon, Mother.
Afternoon, Mrs. Nigger-Baiter.

Oh, he's walking already.

-Look at him laughing, eh?
-Yeah.

He's a chirpy little fellow,
isn't he?

Isn't he a chirpy

Does he talk?
Does he talk, eh?

00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:16,600
Of course I can talk.

Look at his little eyes
following it, eh?

Look at his iggy-tiggy-biggy

Oh, Mother, don't be
so sentimental.

00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:52,960
Yes, I suppose so.

232
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,680
Anyway, I didn't really
like her that much.

-Ooh.

Hello, I'm your new vicar.

235
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,360
Can I interest you
in any encyclopedias?

236
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,000
No, thank you.

237
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,720
We're not church people,
thank you.

238
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:06,400
How about brushes?
Nylon or bristle?

Strong-tufted,

00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,280
No, really,
thank you, vicar.

Oh, dear. Turkey?
Cup Final tickets?

00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:13,880
No. No, really.
We're just not religious.
Thank you.

00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,040
-Oh, well. Bye-bye.
-Bye-bye, vicar.

244
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:19,920
If you do want anything,

245
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,040
jewellery,
Ascot water heaters...

246
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:23,240
Thank you, vicar.

247
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:26,560
It's funny, isn't it, how--

248
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:30,480
How your best friend
can just blow up like that.

249
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:33,560
I mean, you wouldn't think
it was medically possible,
would you?

250
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,760
This is where Mrs. Shazam
was so wrong.

251
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:39,080
Exploding is a perfectly
normal medical phenomenon.

252
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,920
In many fields
of medicine nowadays,

253
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:43,440
a dose of dynamite
can do a world of good.

254
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:45,040
For instance, athlete's foot,

255
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:47,520
an irritating condition,
can be cured

256
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:52,440
-by applying a small charge
of TNT between each toe.

Hello, I'm your new vicar.

Can I interest you in any of
these watches, pens or biros?

-No, thank you, vicar.
Good morning.
-Morning.

263
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:10,280
Now, many of
the medical profession

264
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,480
are skeptical
about my work.

265
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:14,040
They point to my record
of treatment

266
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,680
of athlete's foot sufferers:

267
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:19,280
Eighty-four dead,
65 severely wounded

268
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:22,280
and 12 missing,
believed cured.

269
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:25,120
But then, people laughed
at Bob Hope.

270
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:26,760
They laughed at my wife

271
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,560
when she wrapped herself up
in greaseproof paper

272
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,920
and hopped into
the Social Security office.

273
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:33,040
But that doesn't mean
that Pasteur was wrong.

what I mean.

he's a world-famous authority
on 19th-century Russian music,

and he's come
into the studio tonight

to talk about Tchaikovsky.

Which is a bit of a pity,
as this is<i> Farming Club.</i>

293
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:17,160
And on<i> Farming Club</i> tonight
we'll take a look

00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,360
at the Ministry's
latest preventative proposals

00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:21,680
to deal with possible
outbreaks of foot-and-mouth.

We'll be talking
later on to the man

301
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:54,440
Tchaikovsky.
Was he the tortured soul

302
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,200
who poured out
his immortal longings

303
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,560
into dignified passages
of stately music?

304
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:01,280
Or was he just an old poof
who wrote tunes?

305
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:03,240
Tonight on<i> Farming Club</i>

306
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:05,840
we're going to take
an intimate look
at Tchaikovsky

307
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:08,320
and an intimate look
at his friends.

308
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:10,680
Incidentally, BBC publications

309
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:13,120
have prepared a special
pamphlet to go
with this program

310
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:15,880
called<i> Hello Pianist.</i>

311
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,200
And it contains material

312
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:19,080
which some people
might find offensive

313
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:21,160
but which is really smashing.

314
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,720
Peter Ilyich Tchaikovsky was
born in 1840 in
a Ken Russell film

315
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:26,720
just outside Saint Petersburg.

316
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:29,080
His father, Leo McKern,
a freelance bishop,

317
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:32,240
was married to Vera Plachenka,
Julie Christie,

318
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:35,080
but secretly deeply in love
with Margo Farenka,

319
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,600
Shirley Abicair,

320
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:39,280
and the strangely flatulent
Madame Ranevsky,

321
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:41,240
Norris McWhirter.

322
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,760
Soon, however, the family,

323
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:45,400
Eldridge Cleaver, Moira Lister
and Stan the Bat,

324
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:48,320
moved to the neighboring
industrial village of Omsk,

325
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:51,040
Eddie Waring, where they soon
found themselves, sadly,

326
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,600
quite unable to cope,
Anthony Barber.

327
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:56,920
In 1863, however,
Tchaikovsky was sent to Moscow

328
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,680
to study the piano.

329
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,280
And when he'd finished that,
the living room.

330
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,320
Maurice takes up the story.

331
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:04,280
Well, guess what?

332
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,960
The very next thing he did was
to go to this extraordinary,

00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,320
but extraordinary

00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:22,000
that everybody but everybody
wanted to know.

340
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:24,400
And quite right too because
she wrote some lovely bits

341
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:25,960
such as Sally
<i>Sleeping Beauty,</i>

342
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,240
Patsy "Pathétique,"
Adrian "1812,"

343
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:30,960
and lots of Conny concerti
for Vera "Violin"

344
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,720
and Peter "Piano" Fanny forte.

345
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:36,160
But what do we really know
of this tortured ponce?

346
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:38,720
Well, if you can imagine
the size of Nelson's Column,

347
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:40,880
roughly three times the size
of a London bus,

348
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:43,600
then Tchaikovsky
was much smaller.

349
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:45,160
His head was about
the same size

350
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:47,280
as that of an extremely
large dog.

351
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,960
That is, say,
two very small dogs

352
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,200
or four very large hamsters.

353
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:53,200

354
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:55,120

not just the head.

crouching amidst the scuppers,

was the most ghastly creature
I'd ever seen in my life.

in a ghastly look of terror.

of the midday sun.

shut the hatch
