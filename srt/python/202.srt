00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:54,320
have you reached a verdict?

358
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:55,760
We have, my lord.

359
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:57,480
And how do you find
the defendant?

360
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:02,160
Two words. First word.

361
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:07,680
Rope? String?

362
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:10,880
Point?

363
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:13,280

-Esther Williams, then.
-No, no, don't be silly.

376
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,760
How can you find someone
Not Esther Williams?

-Fish wheeze?
-[ACTOR GASPING]

380
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,280
Fish breathe.

00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,280
Fish breathe throat.

382
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:57,240
Fish breathe throat?
Gill!

383
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:59,840

Right. My turn.

395
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:32,560
Four words.

396
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:35,840
Uh, first word "shout"?

Um. A?

401
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,920
-An?
-Up?

-Adam's apple.
-Neck.

408
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:01,000
Sounds like neck?

409
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:02,400
Next.

410
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:03,640
Call the next!

Call the next defendant!
Call the next defendant.

423
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:41,200
The Honorable
Mr. Justice Kilbraken.

424
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:48,400
If I may charge you, my lord?

425
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:49,960
You are charged, my lord,

426
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,240
that on the fourteenth day
of June, 1970,

427
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:54,960
at the Central Criminal Court,
you did commit acts

428
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,280
likely to cause a breach
of the peace.

429
00:25:57,320 --> 00:26:00,160
How plead you, my lord,
guilty or not guilty?

430
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:03,400
Not guilty. Case not proven.
Court adjourned.

431
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:07,240
JUDGE:
No, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no.

432
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:09,360
No-no. No.

433
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:11,240
No, you're in the dock,
my lord.

434
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:12,560
I'm a judge, my lord.

435
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:14,920
So am I, my lord. So watch it.

436
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:16,520
Ha! Call this a court?

437
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:17,800
MAN 1:
Call this a court.

438
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:19,520
ALL:
Call this a court.

439
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:22,320
Shut up. Right.
Now, get on with the spiel.

440
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:24,480
My lord, and my other lord,

441
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:26,480
uh, the prosecution
will endeavor to show,
my lord,

442
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:28,280
that my lord--
Uh, not you, my lord.

443
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,720
That my lord, my lord.
While passing sentence

444
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:33,800
at the Central Criminal Court
blotted his copybook.

445
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:35,760
Call exhibit Q.

446
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:37,960
Q?

447
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,880
Sorry, did I say Q? I meant A.
Sorry, call exhibit A.

448
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:44,280
MAN 1:
Call exhibit A.

449
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:52,800
Exhibit A, my lord,
Miss Rita Thang.

450
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:57,200
An artist's model,
Swedish accordion teacher,

451
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:00,240
and cane-chair saleslady,
was found guilty

452
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:03,880
under the Rude Behavior Act
in the accused's court.

453
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:05,360
The accused, my lord,

454
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:07,720
sentenced her to be
taken from this place

455
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:10,440
and brought round
to his place.

456
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:12,600
-Objection, my lord.
-Objection sustained.

457
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,400
You shut up!
Objection overruled.

458
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:16,120
Now, the accused
then commented

459
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:18,240
on Miss Thang's
bodily structure,

460
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:22,160
made several not-at-all legal
remarks on the subject of fun,

461
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:24,400
and then placed his robes
over his head

462
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:26,960
and began to emit low moans.

463
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,840
Have you anything to say
in your defense?

464
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:31,640
I haven't had any for weeks.

465
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:33,880
Oh, no? What about
that little number you've got

466
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:35,440
tucked away in Belsize Park?

467
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:36,520
Oh, I never!

468
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:38,160
Oh, no. Ho-ho-ho-ho!

469
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:40,360
All right, then what about
8A Woodford Square?

470
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:43,000
You say anything about that
and I'll do you for treason.

471
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:44,520
Uh, my lord,
if we could continue.

472
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:46,160
He's got a Chinese
bit there.

473
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:47,640
No, that's contempt
of court.

474
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:50,120
-Oh, it's only a joke.
-Contempt of court.

475
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:52,280
However, I'm not
going to punish you

476
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:54,600
because we're so short
of judges at the moment.

477
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:57,120
What with all of them
emigrating to South Africa.

478
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:59,040
I'm going tomorrow,
I've got me ticket.

479
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:01,640
Get out there and get
some decent sentencing done.

480
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:04,200
Ooh! England makes you sick.

481
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:06,920
Best I can manage here
is life imprisonment.

482
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:08,800
Hardly worth coming in
in the morning.

483
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:10,880
Now, South Africa,

484
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:12,520
you've got your
cat-o'-nine-tails,

485
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:14,320
you've got
four death sentences a week.

486
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:15,760
You've got cheap drinks,

487
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:17,280
slave labor
and a booming stock market.

488
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:18,760
I'm off, I tell you.

489
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:21,760
Yes. I'm up to here
with probation

490
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:24,520
and bleeding
psychiatric reports.

491
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:26,880
That's it, I'm off. That's it.

492
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:30,040
Right. But I'm going to have
one final fling before
I leave.

493
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:33,840
So I sentence you
to be burnt at the stake.

494
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:37,160
Blimey. I didn't expect
the Spanish Inquisition.

495
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:45,040
[♪♪]

496
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:01,120
Two-- Three
for the Old Bailey, please.

497
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:05,680
-Look, they've
started the credits.
-Hurry, hurry, hurry!

498
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:06,760
Hurry, hurry!

499
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:20,840
There's the lighting credit.
Only five left.

500
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,400
Hell, it's the producer.
Quick!

501
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:53,800
Nobody expects the Span--
Oh, bugger.
