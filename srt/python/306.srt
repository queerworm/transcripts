mollusk, viz., a snail,

176
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:03,720
consists of a prominent
muscular portion,
the head-foot,

177
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,560
a visceral mass, and a shell,

178
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,280
which is secreted by the free
edge of the mantle.

179
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,720
-Dreadful, isn't it?
-What?

180
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:13,120
I was talking to him.

181
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:14,880
Oh. Well, anyway,

182
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:17,520
in some mollusks, however,
viz., slugs,

183
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:19,520
the shell is absent
or rudimentary.

184
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:20,920
Switch him off.

185
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,920
Whereas in others,
viz., cephalopods

186
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,880
the head-foot
is greatly modified,

187
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:27,240
and forms tentacles,
viz., the squid.

188
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:29,080
-What are you doing?
-Switching you off.

189
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:31,320

-Oh, it's dreadful.

190

-Embarrassing.
-Is it?

191
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,120
Yes, it's perfectly awful.

192
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:36,920
Disgraceful. I don't know how
they got the nerve
to put it on.

-Oh, um, anyway,
the majority of mollusks

198
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,520

in three large groups:

199
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:51,120
The gastropods,
the lamellibranches

200
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:52,560
and the cephalopods.

202

Ooh.

205
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:03,520
Yes, the mollusk
is a randy little fellow,

206
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:05,920

scarcely strays

-Disgusting.
-Ought not to be allowed.

is the limpet.

is always on the job.

are something startling.

213

the female limpet

Another loose-living gastropod
is the periwinkle.

00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:38,320

is its motto.

222
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,160

344
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:44,400
One can see the immense amount
of preparation involved.

345
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:47,280
Have there been difficulties
in setting up this venture?

346
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:49,760
Well, the real hang-up
was with the bread, man,

347
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,480
but when the top-brass
pigs came through,

348
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:53,400
we got it together
in a couple of moons.

349
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:55,760
Commodore Betty Grable,
who's a real sub-aqua head,

-been a real gas, man.
-Thank you.

You've kept this all very
hush-hush so far, shipmate.

Yeah, it's been, uh,
really heavy, man,

from the fascist press

the whole scene.

There's no doubt about it,

00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,120
this expedition does have some
rather unusual aspects, Jim lad.

363
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:29,680
For starters,
why do the senior personnel

364
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:32,440
all bear the names of Hollywood
film stars of the '40s,

365
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:36,320

Shiver me timbers,
'tis the black spot.

And secondly-- I be not afraid
of thee, Blind Pew.

--why do they talk
this rather strange,

stilted,
underground jargon--?

The man in charge
of this expedition

is Vice Admiral
Sir John Cunningham.

-Sir John, hello there. Hello.
-Oh, hello.

396
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:08,480
Well, first of all, I'd like
to apologize for the behavior

397
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:11,160
of certain of my colleagues
you may have seen earlier.

398
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:14,400
But they are from broken homes,
circus families and so on.

399
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:16,400
And they are in no way
representative

400
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:19,600
of the new, modern,
improved British navy.

401
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:22,320
There is a small,
vociferous minority.

402
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:25,040
And may I take this
opportunity of emphasizing

403
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:28,200
that there is no cannibalism
in the British navy.

404
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,920
Absolutely none.

405
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:33,120
And when I say none, I mean
there is a certain amount,

406
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:34,920
more than I'm prepared
to admit.

407
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:38,080
But all new ratings
are warned

408
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:41,440
that if they wake up
in the morning, and find
any tooth marks at all,

409
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:43,080
anywhere on their bodies,

410
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:44,920
they're to tell me
immediately,

411
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:47,440
so that I can immediately
take every measure

412
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:49,240
to hush the whole thing up.

413
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:54,240

where exactly is the lake?

Uh, 22-A Runcorn Avenue,
I think.

-Yes, that's right, 22-A.
-Runcorn Avenue?

422
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:20,400
Yes, i-it's just by Blenheim
Crescent. Do you know it?

423
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:22,840
You mean it's in, uh,
an ordinary street?

424
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,720
Of course it's not ordinary,
it's got a lake in it.

Yes, but I--

do you know that have
got lakes in them?

You mean--?
Is it very large?

428
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:32,720
Of course it's not large.

You couldn't get a large lake
in Runcorn Avenue.

where exactly is the lake?

Um, excuse me, um--

439
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:03,280
-Yes, this is the one
all right.
-But it's an ordinary house.

with this line of questioning.

look like a lake.

Your whole approach since
this interview started

443
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:10,920
has been to mock the navy.

When I think that it was
for the likes of you

445
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:15,200
I had both my legs blown off--

You haven't had both
your legs blown off.

all ready, man.

an easy chance

513
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:32,960
to clinch the game
towards the final whistle,

514
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,200
but Raith must be well-satisfied
with their point.

515
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:37,400
Do, please, go on.

516
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,960
This is the least fascinating
conversation I've ever had.

517
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,840
Would you like to order, sir?

518
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:44,000
Ah, yes, Mr. Badger, what would
you like to start with?

519
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:47,360
Uh... I'll have a whisky
to start with.

520
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:49,120
-For first course, sir?
-Aye.

521
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:51,920
And for main course, sir?

522
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:54,120
Uh, I'll have a whisky
for main course,

523
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:56,920
and I'll follow that
with a whisky for pudding.

524
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:00,000
Yes, sir. And what would you
like with it, sir?

525
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:02,240
-A whisky?
-No, a bottle of wine.

526
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:05,800
"Fine, sir," he said
between clenched teeth,

527
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:08,680
knowing full well it was
the most unrewarding part.

528
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:13,320
This is the silliest sketch
I've ever been in.

529
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:15,000
Shall we stop it?

530
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:17,760
Yeah, all right.

531
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:25,440
