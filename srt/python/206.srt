Hello, good evening,
and welcome to<i> It's a Living.</i>

The rules are very simple.

4
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:18,200
Each week we get a large fee.

5
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,160
At the end of that week
we get another large fee.

6
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:22,520
If there's been
no interruption at
the end of the year,

7
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:25,240
we get a repeat fee, which
can be added on for
tax purposes

8
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:26,960
to the previous year,
or the following year

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,800
if there's no new series.

10
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:31,280
Every contestant, in addition
to getting a large fee,

11
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:33,280
is entitled to three drinks
at the BBC,

12
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:35,720
or, if the show is over,
seven drinks.

13
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:37,800
Unless he's an MP,
in which case

14
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:39,720
he can have seven drinks
before the show.

15

Or a bishop,
only three drinks in toto.

16
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:44,880
The winners will receive
an additional fee,

17
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:47,000
a prize which
they can flog back,

18

appearance on
