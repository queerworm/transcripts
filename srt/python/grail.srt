00:00:07,048 --> 00:00:09,969
[dramatic music]

00:00:38,831 --> 00:00:40,791
[dramatic music continues]

00:02:00,287 --> 00:02:03,540
[music stops]

4
00:02:06,043 --> 00:02:08,169
[music resumes]

00:02:09,296 --> 00:02:11,256
[music stops]

00:02:19,347 --> 00:02:21,934
[inspirational orchestral music]

00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:00,472
[music stops]

8
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:14,028
[mariachi music]

00:03:31,837 --> 00:03:33,463
[music stops]

10
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:50,438
[wind howling]

11
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,067
[bird screeching]

12
00:03:56,277 --> 00:03:59,073
[galloping sound]

13
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:16,965
Whoa, there!

14
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:36,568
Halt!

15
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:38,653
Who goes there?

16
00:04:38,695 --> 00:04:41,573
It is I, Arthur,
Son of Uther Pendragon,

17
00:04:41,615 --> 00:04:43,200
from the Castle of Camelot,

18
00:04:43,242 --> 00:04:46,703
king of the Britons,
defeater of the Saxons,

19
00:04:46,745 --> 00:04:49,164
sovereign of all England.

20
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:52,417
Pull the other one.

21
00:04:52,459 --> 00:04:55,963
I am, and this is
my trusty servant, Patsy.

22
00:04:56,004 --> 00:04:58,298
We have ridden the length
and breadth of the land

23
00:04:58,339 --> 00:04:59,674
in search of knights

24
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:02,010
who will join me
in my court at Camelot.

25
00:05:02,052 --> 00:05:04,596
I must speak
with your lord and master.

26
00:05:04,638 --> 00:05:07,474
-What? Ridden on a horse?
-Yes.

27
00:05:07,515 --> 00:05:09,893
-You're using coconuts!
-What?

28
00:05:09,935 --> 00:05:12,062
You've got two empty halves
of coconut,

29
00:05:12,104 --> 00:05:13,981
and you're banging them
together.

30
00:05:14,022 --> 00:05:18,318
So? We have ridden since
the snows of winter
covered this land.

31
00:05:18,359 --> 00:05:19,903
Through the Kingdom of Mercia.

32
00:05:19,945 --> 00:05:21,029
Where did you
get the coconuts?

33
00:05:22,114 --> 00:05:23,448
We found them.

34
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:27,035
Found them? In Mercia?
The coconut is tropical.

35
00:05:27,077 --> 00:05:28,203
What do you mean?

36
00:05:28,245 --> 00:05:29,746
Well, this is a temperate zone.

37
00:05:29,788 --> 00:05:31,790
The swallow may fly
south with the sun,

38
00:05:31,832 --> 00:05:33,500
or the house martin
or the plover

39
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:35,752
may seek warmer climes
in winter,

40
00:05:35,794 --> 00:05:38,046
yet these are not strangers
to our land.

41
00:05:38,088 --> 00:05:41,340
Are you suggesting
coconuts migrate?

42
00:05:41,382 --> 00:05:43,844
Not at all.
They could be carried.

43
00:05:43,885 --> 00:05:46,805
What?
A swallow carrying a coconut?

44
00:05:46,847 --> 00:05:48,640
It could grip it by the husk.

45
00:05:48,682 --> 00:05:51,392
It's not a question
of where he grips it.

46
00:05:51,434 --> 00:05:54,271
It's a simple question
of weight ratios.

47
00:05:54,313 --> 00:05:58,441
A five-ounce bird could not
carry a one-pound coconut.

48
00:05:58,483 --> 00:06:00,235
It doesn't matter.

49
00:06:00,277 --> 00:06:01,736
Will you go and tell your master

50
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:05,073
that Arthur from the court
of Camelot is here?

51
00:06:05,115 --> 00:06:08,367
Listen, in order to maintain
air-speed velocity,

52
00:06:08,409 --> 00:06:10,704
a swallow needs
to beat its wings

53
00:06:10,745 --> 00:06:12,914
43 times every second,
right?

54
00:06:12,956 --> 00:06:15,667
-Please!
-Am I right?

55
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:17,127
I'm not interested.

56
00:06:17,169 --> 00:06:20,797
It could be carried
by an African swallow.

57
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:22,841
Oh, yes!
An African swallow, maybe.

58
00:06:22,883 --> 00:06:25,552
Not a European swallow.
That's my point.

59
00:06:25,593 --> 00:06:27,054
Oh, yeah.
I agree with that.

60
00:06:27,095 --> 00:06:28,429
Will you ask your master

61
00:06:28,471 --> 00:06:31,099
if he wants
to join my court at Camelot?

62
00:06:32,184 --> 00:06:33,352
But then, of course,

63
00:06:33,392 --> 00:06:35,312
African swallows
are non-migratory.

64
00:06:35,354 --> 00:06:36,771
Oh, yes.

65
00:06:36,813 --> 00:06:38,940
So, they couldn't bring
a coconut back, anyway.

66
00:06:38,982 --> 00:06:43,111
Wait a minute! Supposing two
swallows carried it together?

67
00:06:43,153 --> 00:06:44,905
No, they'd have to have it
on a line.

68
00:06:44,946 --> 00:06:48,367
Simple. They'd just use
a strand of creeper.

69
00:06:48,407 --> 00:06:50,744
What, held under
the dorsal guiding feathers?

70
00:06:50,785 --> 00:06:51,953
Well, why not?

71
00:06:51,995 --> 00:06:53,788
-[people sobbing]
-[bell dings]

72
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:55,332
Bring out your dead!

73
00:06:58,793 --> 00:07:00,337
Bring out your dead!

74
00:07:03,548 --> 00:07:05,384
Bring out your dead!

75
00:07:08,845 --> 00:07:10,680
Bring out your dead!

76
00:07:12,766 --> 00:07:14,475
Bring out your dead!

77
00:07:14,517 --> 00:07:16,519
[coughing]

78
00:07:16,561 --> 00:07:18,605
Bring out your dead!

79
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,067
Bring out your dead!

80
00:07:24,611 --> 00:07:26,196
Bring out your dead!

81
00:07:27,281 --> 00:07:28,365
Nine pence.

82
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:32,160
Bring out your dead!

83
00:07:36,206 --> 00:07:37,999
Bring out your dead!

84
00:07:43,546 --> 00:07:48,176
-Bring out your dead!
-[cat snarls]

85
00:07:48,218 --> 00:07:50,511
-Bring out your dead!
-Here's one.

86
00:07:50,553 --> 00:07:51,679
Nine pence.

87
00:07:51,721 --> 00:07:53,390
-I'm not dead!
-What?

88
00:07:53,432 --> 00:07:54,557
Nothing.
Here's your nine pence.

89
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:56,143
I'm not dead!

90
00:07:56,184 --> 00:07:58,437
-Here. He says he's not dead.
-Yes, he is.

91
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:00,021
-I'm not!
-He isn't?

92
00:08:00,063 --> 00:08:01,522
He will be soon.
He's very ill.

93
00:08:01,564 --> 00:08:03,233
I'm getting better!

94
00:08:03,275 --> 00:08:05,110
No, you're not. You'll be
stone dead in a moment.

95
00:08:05,152 --> 00:08:07,321
I can't take him like that.
It's against regulations.

96
00:08:07,362 --> 00:08:09,323
I don't want to go on the cart.

97
00:08:09,364 --> 00:08:10,698
Don't be such a baby.

98
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:12,951
-I can't take him.
-I feel fine.

99
00:08:12,993 --> 00:08:15,036
-Well, do us a favor.
-I can't.

100
00:08:15,078 --> 00:08:17,747
Can you hang around a couple
of minutes? He won't be long.

101
00:08:17,789 --> 00:08:20,541
Got to go to the Robinsons'.
They've lost nine today.

102
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:22,502
-When's your next round?
-Thursday.

103
00:08:22,543 --> 00:08:23,962
I think I'll go for a walk.

104
00:08:24,004 --> 00:08:25,588
You're not fooling anyone,
you know.

105
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:27,548
Look, isn't there something
you can do?

106
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:32,137
I feel happy!
I feel happy!

107
00:08:32,179 --> 00:08:33,972
-[man grunts]
-Thanks very much.

108
00:08:34,014 --> 00:08:35,723
Not at all.
See you on Thursday.

109
00:08:35,765 --> 00:08:36,891
Right.

110
00:08:40,728 --> 00:08:44,024
-Who's that, then?
-I don't know. Must be a king.

111
00:08:44,065 --> 00:08:45,150
Why?

112
00:08:45,192 --> 00:08:46,567
He hasn't got shit all over him.

113
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:12,469
-Old woman!
-Man!

114
00:09:12,511 --> 00:09:16,056
Man, sorry. What knight
lives in that castle over there?

115
00:09:16,097 --> 00:09:18,558
-I'm 37.
-What?

116
00:09:18,599 --> 00:09:22,562
-I'm 37. I'm not old.
-I can't just call you "man."

117
00:09:22,603 --> 00:09:23,980
You could say "Dennis."

118
00:09:24,022 --> 00:09:25,565
I didn't know you
were called Dennis.

119
00:09:25,606 --> 00:09:27,442
Well, you didn't bother
to find out, did you?

120
00:09:27,484 --> 00:09:30,278
I did say sorry about the
"old woman," but from behind--

121
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,946
What I object to

122
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:33,573
is that you automatically
treat me like an inferior.

123
00:09:33,614 --> 00:09:36,410
-Well, I am king.
-King? Very nice.

124
00:09:36,451 --> 00:09:40,288
How did you get that?
By exploiting the workers!

125
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:42,541
By hanging on to outdated
imperialist dogma

126
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:44,167
which perpetuates

127
00:09:44,209 --> 00:09:46,836
the economic and social
differences in our society!

128
00:09:46,878 --> 00:09:48,463
If there's ever going to be
any progress--

129
00:09:48,505 --> 00:09:52,008
Dennis, there's some
lovely filth down here. Ooh.

130
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:53,760
How do you do?

131
00:09:53,801 --> 00:09:57,055
How do you do, good lady? I am
Arthur, King of the Britons.

132
00:09:57,097 --> 00:09:59,015
-Whose castle is that?
-King of the who?

133
00:09:59,057 --> 00:10:01,101
-The Britons.
-Who are the Britons?

134
00:10:01,142 --> 00:10:04,604
We all are. We're all Britons.
And I am your king.

135
00:10:04,645 --> 00:10:06,606
Didn't know we had a king.

136
00:10:06,647 --> 00:10:08,442
I thought we were
an autonomous collective.

137
00:10:08,483 --> 00:10:11,611
You're fooling yourself.
We're living in a dictatorship.

138
00:10:11,652 --> 00:10:15,031
A self-perpetuating autocracy
in which the working class--

139
00:10:15,073 --> 00:10:17,409
There you go!
Bringing class into it again.

140
00:10:17,451 --> 00:10:19,453
That's what it's all about.
If only people--

141
00:10:19,494 --> 00:10:22,539
Please! Please, good people.
I am in haste.

142
00:10:22,581 --> 00:10:24,791
Who lives in that castle?

143
00:10:24,832 --> 00:10:26,834
-No one lives there.
-Then who is your lord?

144
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:28,962
-We don't have a lord.
-What?

145
00:10:29,003 --> 00:10:32,424
I told you. We're an
anarcho-syndicalist commune.

146
00:10:32,466 --> 00:10:33,841
We take it in turns

147
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:35,885
to act as a sort of executive
officer for the week.

148
00:10:35,927 --> 00:10:37,262
Yes.

149
00:10:37,304 --> 00:10:38,888
But all the decisions
of that officer

150
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:40,640
have to be ratified
at a special biweekly meeting.

151
00:10:40,681 --> 00:10:42,476
Yes, I see.

152
00:10:42,517 --> 00:10:44,394
By a simple majority in the case
of purely internal affairs.

153
00:10:44,436 --> 00:10:45,645
Be quiet!

154
00:10:45,686 --> 00:10:47,147
By a two-thirds majority
in the case of--

155
00:10:47,188 --> 00:10:49,857
Be quiet!
I order you to be quiet.

156
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:52,026
"Order"?
Who does he think he is?

157
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:54,946
-I am your king!
-Well, I didn't vote for you.

158
00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:58,866
-You don't vote for kings.
-How did you become king then?

159
00:10:58,908 --> 00:11:00,494
The Lady of the Lake,

160
00:11:00,535 --> 00:11:03,788
her arm clad in the purest
shimmering samite,

161
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:07,584
held aloft Excalibur
from the bosom of the water,

162
00:11:07,626 --> 00:11:09,294
signifying,
by divine providence,

163
00:11:09,336 --> 00:11:12,964
that I, Arthur,
was to carry Excalibur.

164
00:11:13,006 --> 00:11:14,841
That is why I'm your king!

165
00:11:14,882 --> 00:11:17,177
Listen. Strange women
lying in ponds

166
00:11:17,218 --> 00:11:19,179
distributing swords, is no basis

167
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:22,599
for a system of government.
Supreme executive power

168
00:11:22,641 --> 00:11:24,351
derives from a mandate
from the masses.

169
00:11:24,392 --> 00:11:26,978
Not from some
farcical aquatic ceremony.

170
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:28,855
Be quiet!

171
00:11:28,896 --> 00:11:31,774
You can't expect to wield
supreme executive power

172
00:11:31,816 --> 00:11:34,068
just 'cause some watery tart
threw a sword at you.

173
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:35,736
Shut up!

174
00:11:35,778 --> 00:11:37,322
I mean, if I went around
saying I was an emperor

175
00:11:37,364 --> 00:11:38,948
because some moistened bint

176
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:41,951
had lobbed a scimitar at me,
they'd put me away!

177
00:11:41,993 --> 00:11:43,786
Shut up!
Will you shut up?

178
00:11:43,828 --> 00:11:46,331
Now we see the violence
inherent in the system.

179
00:11:46,373 --> 00:11:47,874
Shut up!

180
00:11:47,915 --> 00:11:49,959
Come and see the violence
inherent in the system!

181
00:11:50,001 --> 00:11:53,087
-Help, I'm being repressed!
-Bloody peasant!

182
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:55,590
What a giveaway.
Did you hear that?

183
00:11:55,632 --> 00:11:57,592
That's what I'm on about.
Did you see him repressing me?

184
00:11:57,634 --> 00:11:58,593
You saw it didn't you?

185
00:12:14,817 --> 00:12:16,194

186

189

You fight with the strength
of many men, Sir Knight.

190
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:44,115
I am Arthur,
King of the Britons.

191
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:50,246
I seek the finest
and the bravest knights

192
00:13:50,288 --> 00:13:53,040
in the land to join me
in my court at Camelot.

193
00:13:58,171 --> 00:14:01,591
You have proved yourself worthy.
Will you join me?

194
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:10,642
You make me sad.
So be it. Come, Patsy.

195
00:14:10,684 --> 00:14:12,310
None shall pass.

196
00:14:12,352 --> 00:14:14,813
-What?
-None shall pass.

197
00:14:14,853 --> 00:14:17,231
I have no quarrel with you,
good Sir Knight,

198
00:14:17,273 --> 00:14:19,066
but I must cross this bridge.

199
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:21,653
Then you shall die.

200
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:26,533
I command you, as King
of the Britons, to stand aside.

201
00:14:26,574 --> 00:14:30,578
I move for no man.

202
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:33,164
So be it!

203
00:14:38,795 --> 00:14:41,339
[screaming]

204
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:01,984
Now, stand aside,
worthy adversary.

205
00:15:02,026 --> 00:15:05,363
-'Tis but a scratch.
-"A scratch"? Your arm's off.

206
00:15:05,405 --> 00:15:07,281
-No, it isn't.
-Well, what's that, then?

207
00:15:08,867 --> 00:15:10,410
-I've had worse.
-You liar.

208
00:15:10,451 --> 00:15:12,036
Come on, you pansy!

209
00:15:20,127 --> 00:15:21,504
Victory is mine.

210
00:15:23,297 --> 00:15:25,299
We thank thee,
Lord, that in thy--

211
00:15:26,843 --> 00:15:28,720
-Come on, then.
-What?

212
00:15:28,762 --> 00:15:29,888
Have at you.

213
00:15:31,598 --> 00:15:32,891
You are indeed brave,
Sir Knight,

214
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:36,644
-but the fight is mine.
-Oh, had enough, eh?

215
00:15:36,686 --> 00:15:39,355
Look, you stupid bastard!
You've got no arms left.

216
00:15:39,397 --> 00:15:41,274
-Yes, I have.
-Look!

217
00:15:41,315 --> 00:15:43,860
Just a flesh wound.

218
00:15:43,902 --> 00:15:46,320
-Look, stop that.
-Chicken! Chicken!

219
00:15:46,362 --> 00:15:48,865
I'll have your leg. Right!

220
00:15:51,701 --> 00:15:54,161
-Right! I'll do you for that.
-You'll what?

221
00:15:54,203 --> 00:15:55,622
Come here.

222
00:15:55,663 --> 00:15:57,081
What are you going to do?
Bleed on me?

223
00:15:57,123 --> 00:16:00,084
-I am invincible!
-You're a loony.

224
00:16:00,126 --> 00:16:04,338
The Black Knight always
triumphs. Have at you!

225
00:16:05,423 --> 00:16:06,674
Come on, then.

226
00:16:11,888 --> 00:16:14,766
All right,
we'll call it a draw.

227
00:16:14,808 --> 00:16:17,894
-Come, Patsy.
-Oh, I see.

228
00:16:17,936 --> 00:16:21,481
Running away, eh?
You yellow bastards!

229
00:16:21,522 --> 00:16:24,275
Come back here
and take what's coming to you!

Burn her! Burn her!

242
00:17:31,425 --> 00:17:33,302
How do you know
she is a witch?

243
00:17:33,344 --> 00:17:34,888
She looks like one.

244
00:17:36,597 --> 00:17:38,766
Bring her forward.

245
00:17:38,808 --> 00:17:43,563
-I am not a witch.
-But you are dressed as one.

246
00:17:43,604 --> 00:17:46,440
-They dressed me up like this.
-We didn't!

247
00:17:46,482 --> 00:17:48,776
And this isn't my nose.
It's a false one.

248
00:17:52,613 --> 00:17:55,742
-Well?
-Well, we did do the nose.

249
00:17:55,783 --> 00:17:56,993
The nose?

250
00:17:57,035 --> 00:17:58,995
And the hat.
But she is a witch.

251
00:17:59,037 --> 00:18:02,832
Burn her! Burn her!

252
00:18:02,874 --> 00:18:04,333
Did you dress her
up like this?

253
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:06,836
-No! No!
-No!

254
00:18:06,878 --> 00:18:08,295
-Yes. Yes.
-Yes.

255
00:18:08,337 --> 00:18:10,631
-A bit. She has got a wart.
-A bit.

256
00:18:12,132 --> 00:18:14,176
What makes you think
she is a witch?

257
00:18:14,218 --> 00:18:16,136
Well,
she turned me into a newt.

258
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:18,598
A newt?

259
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:24,478
I got better.

260
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:27,189
-Burn her anyway.
-Burn her!

261
00:18:30,902 --> 00:18:36,115
Quiet! There are ways of telling
whether she is a witch.

262
00:18:36,156 --> 00:18:38,785
Are there? What are they?
Tell us.

263
00:18:38,826 --> 00:18:40,453
Do they hurt?

264
00:18:40,494 --> 00:18:43,414
Tell me,
what do you do with witches?

265
00:18:43,456 --> 00:18:46,417
Burn them! Burn them!

266
00:18:46,459 --> 00:18:49,169
And what do you burn apart
from witches?

267
00:18:49,211 --> 00:18:50,713
More witches!

268
00:18:52,048 --> 00:18:55,593
-Wood.
-So, why do witches burn?

269
00:19:07,021 --> 00:19:09,273
-'Cause they're made of wood?
-Good.

270
00:19:11,609 --> 00:19:14,821
So, how do we tell
whether she is made of wood?

271
00:19:15,863 --> 00:19:17,364
Build a bridge out of her.

272
00:19:17,406 --> 00:19:21,119
Ah, but can you not
also make bridges out of stone?

273
00:19:22,202 --> 00:19:23,287
Oh, yeah.

274
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:27,041
Does wood sink in water?

275
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:29,585
-No.
-It floats! It floats!

276
00:19:29,627 --> 00:19:30,837
Throw her into the pond!

277
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:38,427
-What also floats in water?
-Bread.

278
00:19:38,469 --> 00:19:40,513
-Apples.
-Very small rocks.

279
00:19:40,554 --> 00:19:43,641
-Cider. Cherries.
-Gravy. Mud.

280
00:19:43,683 --> 00:19:45,810
-Churches.
-Lead.

281
00:19:45,852 --> 00:19:46,894
A duck!

282
00:19:49,396 --> 00:19:50,690
Exactly.

283
00:19:52,232 --> 00:19:54,193
So, logically...

284
00:19:54,234 --> 00:19:56,863
If she...

285
00:19:56,904 --> 00:19:59,157
weighs the same as a duck...

286
00:20:01,659 --> 00:20:03,119
she's made of wood.

287
00:20:03,161 --> 00:20:04,578
And, therefore...

288
00:20:06,998 --> 00:20:08,749
-A witch!
-A witch!

289
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:15,339
We shall use my largest scales.

290
00:20:35,609 --> 00:20:39,655
Right. Remove the supports!

291
00:20:44,368 --> 00:20:46,453
-A witch!
-A witch!

292
00:20:46,495 --> 00:20:49,082
-It's a fair cop.
-Burn her!

293
00:20:56,338 --> 00:20:59,675
Who are you, who are so wise
in the ways of science?

294
00:20:59,717 --> 00:21:02,595
I am Arthur,
King of the Britons.

295
00:21:02,636 --> 00:21:04,304
My liege.

296
00:21:04,346 --> 00:21:07,141
Good Sir Knight, will you come
with me to Camelot,

297
00:21:07,183 --> 00:21:09,936
and join us
at the Round Table?

298
00:21:09,977 --> 00:21:12,605
My liege,
I would be honored.

299
00:21:12,646 --> 00:21:15,649
-What is your name?
-Bedevere, my liege.

300
00:21:15,691 --> 00:21:19,278
Then I dub you Sir Bedevere,

301
00:21:19,319 --> 00:21:21,614
knight of the Round Table.

302
00:21:21,655 --> 00:21:24,825
[narrator]<i> The wise Sir Bedevere</i>

<i>Sir Galahad the Pure.</i>

313

It is King Arthur, and these are

Whose castle is this?

This is the castle of my master,
Guy de Loimbard.

-Wicked, bad, naughty Zoot!

She has been setting light
to our beacon,

604
00:40:47,779 --> 00:40:50,615

is Grail-shaped.

the previous scenes, I think.

was better visually.

for setting alight
the Grail-shaped beacon.

and spank her.

deal with her as you like.

-And me!

00:44:08,605 --> 00:44:11,357
which no man has ever crossed.

687
00:44:11,399 --> 00:44:13,901
But the Grail.
Where is the Grail?

688
00:44:13,943 --> 00:44:17,696
Seek you the Bridge of Death.

689
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:21,367
The Bridge of Death
which leads to the Grail?

690
00:44:21,409 --> 00:44:22,910
[cackling]

691
00:45:04,035 --> 00:45:07,455
Ni! Ni! Ni!

692
00:45:07,497 --> 00:45:08,665
Who are you?

693
00:45:08,705 --> 00:45:11,708
We are the knights
who say "Ni"!

694
00:45:11,750 --> 00:45:13,461
No! Not the knights
who say "Ni"?

695
00:45:13,503 --> 00:45:15,588
-The same!
-[man] Who are they?

696
00:45:15,630 --> 00:45:19,175
We are the keepers
of the sacred words.

697
00:45:19,217 --> 00:45:23,720
"Ni," "Peng," and "Neee Wom"!

698
00:45:23,762 --> 00:45:25,890
Those who hear them
seldom live to tell the tale.

699
00:45:25,931 --> 00:45:30,520
The knights who say "Ni"
demand a sacrifice.

700
00:45:30,562 --> 00:45:32,980
Knights of Ni,
we are but simple travelers

701
00:45:33,022 --> 00:45:35,066
who seek the enchanter
who lives beyond these woods.

702
00:45:35,107 --> 00:45:40,613
-Ni! Ni! Ni!
-[knights groan]

703
00:45:40,655 --> 00:45:42,948
[silence]

704
00:45:42,990 --> 00:45:47,786
We shall say "Ni" again to you,
if you do not appease us.

705
00:45:47,828 --> 00:45:50,582
-What is it you want?
-We want...

706
00:45:52,542 --> 00:45:53,459
a shrubbery.

707
00:45:54,919 --> 00:45:55,961
A what?

708
00:45:56,003 --> 00:45:58,548
-Ni! Ni! Ni!
-[knights groan]

709
00:45:58,590 --> 00:46:01,593
Please! Please! No more!
We will find you a shrubbery.

710
00:46:01,634 --> 00:46:04,220
You must return
with a shrubbery,

711
00:46:04,262 --> 00:46:07,139
or else you will never pass
through this wood...

712
00:46:08,224 --> 00:46:10,101
alive.

713
00:46:10,142 --> 00:46:12,311
Knights of Ni,
you are just and fair.

714
00:46:12,353 --> 00:46:14,939
-We will return
with a shrubbery.
-One that looks nice.

715
00:46:14,980 --> 00:46:17,066
-Of course.
-And not too expensive.

716
00:46:17,108 --> 00:46:19,902
-Yes.
-Now...

717
00:46:19,944 --> 00:46:21,070
go!

718
00:46:30,121 --> 00:46:31,456

724
00:47:04,530 --> 00:47:07,241
Stop that!
Stop that! Stop that!

725
00:47:07,283 --> 00:47:10,244
Go on, clear off!
Go on, go away!

726
00:47:10,286 --> 00:47:11,704
Do it! Go away!

727
00:47:12,955 --> 00:47:15,040
And you, clear off!

728
00:47:15,082 --> 00:47:16,334
[grunts]

729
00:47:18,419 --> 00:47:21,506
-[church bell rings]
-Huh. Bloody weather.

730
00:47:21,547 --> 00:47:23,466
[narrator]<i> The tale</i>
<i>of Sir Lancelot.</i>

731
00:47:29,888 --> 00:47:33,184
One day, lad,
all this will be yours.

732
00:47:33,225 --> 00:47:35,812
-What, the curtains?
-No, not the curtains, lad.

733
00:47:35,852 --> 00:47:37,563
All that you can see,

734
00:47:37,605 --> 00:47:40,316
stretched out over the hills
and valleys of this land.

735
00:47:40,358 --> 00:47:42,234
That'll be your kingdom, lad.

736
00:47:42,276 --> 00:47:44,153
-But, Mother.
-Father, lad, father.

737
00:47:44,195 --> 00:47:46,656
But, Father,
I don't want any of that.

738
00:47:46,698 --> 00:47:47,906
Listen, lad.

739
00:47:47,948 --> 00:47:50,493
I built this kingdom
up from nothing.

740
00:47:50,535 --> 00:47:53,245
When I started here,
all there was was a swamp.

741
00:47:53,287 --> 00:47:56,415
Other kings said I was daft
to build a castle on a swamp.

742
00:47:56,457 --> 00:48:00,002
But I built it all the same,
just to show them.

743
00:48:00,044 --> 00:48:03,255
It sank into the swamp.
So, I built a second one.

744
00:48:03,297 --> 00:48:04,841
That sank into the swamp.

745
00:48:04,881 --> 00:48:06,967
So, I built a third one.
That burned down,

746
00:48:07,009 --> 00:48:08,845
fell over,
then sank in the swamp.

747
00:48:08,885 --> 00:48:11,597
But the fourth one stayed up.

748
00:48:11,639 --> 00:48:13,808
And that's what
you're gonna get, lad.

749
00:48:13,850 --> 00:48:16,602
The strongest castle
in these isles.

750
00:48:16,644 --> 00:48:19,146
But I don't want any of that.

751
00:48:19,188 --> 00:48:20,732
-I'd rather--
-Rather what?

752
00:48:20,773 --> 00:48:24,235
-I'd rather just...
-[theatrical music]

753
00:48:24,276 --> 00:48:27,154
-Sing!
-Stop that.

754
00:48:27,196 --> 00:48:29,198
-[music stops]
-You're not going
into a song while I'm here!

755
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:30,742
Now, listen, lad.

756
00:48:30,783 --> 00:48:32,618
In 20 minutes,
you're getting married to a girl

757
00:48:32,660 --> 00:48:36,664
whose father owns the biggest
tracts of open land in Britain.

758
00:48:36,706 --> 00:48:39,500
-But I don't want land.
-Listen, Alice.

759
00:48:39,542 --> 00:48:41,210
-Herbert.
-Herbert.

760
00:48:41,252 --> 00:48:45,089
We live on a bloody swamp,
we need all the land we can get.

761
00:48:45,130 --> 00:48:48,676
-But I don't like her.
-Don't like her?

762
00:48:48,718 --> 00:48:50,511
What's wrong with her?

763
00:48:50,553 --> 00:48:55,349
She's beautiful, she's rich.
She's got huge...

764
00:48:55,391 --> 00:48:57,810
tracts of land.

765
00:48:57,852 --> 00:49:03,691
I know, but I want the girl
that I marry to have...

766
00:49:03,733 --> 00:49:07,904
-A certain special something.
-[theatrical music]

767
00:49:07,944 --> 00:49:10,072
Cut that out! Cut that out!
-[music stops]

768
00:49:11,574 --> 00:49:13,785
You're marrying
Princess Lucky,

769
00:49:13,826 --> 00:49:16,788
so you'd better
get used to the idea!

770
00:49:16,829 --> 00:49:18,205
Guards!

771
00:49:18,247 --> 00:49:20,917
Make sure the prince
doesn't leave this room

772
00:49:20,957 --> 00:49:22,585
until I come and get him.

773
00:49:22,627 --> 00:49:24,961
Not to leave the room,
even if you come and get him.

774
00:49:25,003 --> 00:49:27,590
-[hiccups]
-No. Until I come and get him.

775
00:49:27,632 --> 00:49:30,927
Until you come and get him,
we're not to enter the room.

776
00:49:30,967 --> 00:49:36,056
No, you stay in the room
and make sure he doesn't leave.

777
00:49:36,098 --> 00:49:38,726
-And you'll come and get him.
-Right.

778
00:49:38,768 --> 00:49:40,144
We don't
need to do anything,

779
00:49:40,185 --> 00:49:42,647
apart from just stop him
entering the room.

780
00:49:42,688 --> 00:49:46,066
-No. Leaving the room.
-Leaving the room, yes.

781
00:49:46,108 --> 00:49:48,193
-All right?
-Right. If...

782
00:49:48,235 --> 00:49:51,322
-lf we're...
-Yes, what is it?

783
00:49:51,363 --> 00:49:54,492
-If...
-Look, it's quite simple.

784
00:49:54,533 --> 00:49:58,830
You just stay here and make sure
he doesn't leave the room.

785
00:49:59,996 --> 00:50:01,582
-All right?
-[hiccups]

786
00:50:01,624 --> 00:50:05,001
-Oh, I remember.
Can he leave the room with us?

787
00:50:05,043 --> 00:50:08,923
No, you just keep him in here,
and make sure--

788
00:50:08,965 --> 00:50:11,216
Yes! We'll keep him in here,
obviously.

789
00:50:11,258 --> 00:50:13,051
But if he had to leave
and we were with him--

790
00:50:13,093 --> 00:50:14,762
No. Keep just him in here!

791
00:50:14,804 --> 00:50:17,389
-Until you, or anyone else--
-Not anyone, just me.

792
00:50:17,431 --> 00:50:20,058
-Just you... get back.
-Get back.

793
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:21,393
-Right?
-Right.

794
00:50:21,435 --> 00:50:23,228
We'll stay here
until you get back.

795
00:50:23,270 --> 00:50:25,690
-And make sure he doesn't leave.
-What?

796
00:50:27,441 --> 00:50:30,611
-Make sure he doesn't leave.
-The prince?

797
00:50:30,653 --> 00:50:32,404
Yes, make sure he doesn't leave.

798
00:50:32,446 --> 00:50:35,658
Oh, yes, of course!
I thought you meant him!

799
00:50:35,700 --> 00:50:39,787
It seemed a bit daft me having
to guard him when he's a guard.

800
00:50:39,829 --> 00:50:42,832
-Is that clear?
-Quite clear. No problems.

801
00:50:42,874 --> 00:50:43,958
Right.

802
00:50:46,084 --> 00:50:48,713
-Where are you going?
-We're coming with you.

803
00:50:48,754 --> 00:50:53,425
No, I want you to stay here,
and make sure he doesn't leave.

804
00:50:53,467 --> 00:50:55,469
I see, right.

805
00:50:55,511 --> 00:50:57,013
But, Father...

806
00:50:57,053 --> 00:50:59,139
Shut your noise, you,
and get that suit on.

Over we go! Good, steady!

813

Now, the big one!

"To whoever finds this note.

Please, please come
and rescue me.

I am in the tall tower

At last! A call!
A cry of distress!

This could be the sign
that leads us to the Holy Grail!

Uh, I'm not quite dead, sir.

You shall not have been mortally
wounded in vain!

I think
I could pull through, sir.

Oh, I see.

830
00:53:08,352 --> 00:53:09,478
I think
I'm all right to come with you.

No, sweet Concorde! Stay here.

832
00:53:11,271 --> 00:53:14,566
I will send help as soon as
I have accomplished a daring

833

I have come to take--
I'm terribly sorry.

You got my note!

-Well, no, you see--
-I knew someone would.

I knew that somewhere out there,

00:56:12,661 --> 00:56:15,539
-there must be someone...
-[theatrical music]

857
00:56:15,580 --> 00:56:17,833
-Stop that! Stop that!
Stop it! Stop it!
-[music stops]

858
00:56:19,417 --> 00:56:20,627
Who are you?

859
00:56:20,669 --> 00:56:22,213
-I'm your son.
-No, not you.

860
00:56:22,254 --> 00:56:23,379
I'm Sir Lancelot, sir.

861
00:56:23,421 --> 00:56:25,381
He's come to rescue me,
Father.

862
00:56:25,423 --> 00:56:28,593
-Let's not jump to conclusions.
-Did you kill all those guards?

863
00:56:28,635 --> 00:56:31,596
Uh... Oh, yes. Sorry.

864
00:56:31,638 --> 00:56:34,225
-They cost 50 pounds each.
-I'm awfully sorry.

865
00:56:34,266 --> 00:56:36,101
Don't be afraid of him,
Sir Lancelot.

866
00:56:36,143 --> 00:56:39,021
I've got a rope all ready.

867
00:56:39,063 --> 00:56:41,523
You killed
eight wedding guests and all!

868
00:56:41,565 --> 00:56:44,026
Well, you see,
I thought your son was a lady.

869
00:56:44,068 --> 00:56:45,401
I can understand that.

870
00:56:45,443 --> 00:56:47,779
-Hurry, Sir Lancelot! Hurry!
-Shut up!

871
00:56:47,821 --> 00:56:49,990
You only killed
the bride's father, that's all.

872
00:56:50,032 --> 00:56:51,867
Well, I really didn't mean to.

873
00:56:51,909 --> 00:56:53,911
Didn't mean to? You put your
sword right through his head!

874
00:56:53,952 --> 00:56:56,080
Oh, dear. Is he all right?

875
00:56:56,121 --> 00:56:58,456
You kicked the bride
in the chest! It's going
to cost me a fortune!

876
00:56:58,498 --> 00:57:01,585
I can explain,
I was in the forest,
riding north from Camelot,

877
00:57:01,626 --> 00:57:03,670
-when I got this note.
-Camelot?

878
00:57:03,712 --> 00:57:06,464
-Are you from Camelot?
-Hurry, Sir Lancelot!

879
00:57:06,506 --> 00:57:08,592
I'm a knight
of King Arthur, sir.

880
00:57:08,633 --> 00:57:12,428
Very nice castle, Camelot.
Very good pig country.

881
00:57:12,470 --> 00:57:15,515
-Is it?
-Hurry! I am ready!

882
00:57:15,557 --> 00:57:16,850
Would you like to come
have a drink?

883
00:57:16,892 --> 00:57:19,644
That's awfully nice of you.

884
00:57:19,686 --> 00:57:20,854
I am ready!

885
00:57:20,896 --> 00:57:22,856
I mean,
to be so understanding.

886
00:57:22,898 --> 00:57:24,482
You see,
when I'm in this idiom,

887
00:57:24,524 --> 00:57:26,818

get a bit carried away.

Sorry! You see what I mean,
I just get carried away.

895
00:57:53,971 --> 00:57:56,974
I'm really most awfully sorry.
Sorry, everyone.

Hold it, please, hold it!

898
00:58:02,687 --> 00:58:04,481
This is Sir Lancelot

899
00:58:04,522 --> 00:58:07,067
from the court of Camelot,

900
00:58:07,109 --> 00:58:10,279
a very brave
and influential knight.

901
00:58:10,321 --> 00:58:11,863
And my special guest
here today.

902
00:58:11,905 --> 00:58:14,699
-Hello.
-He killed my auntie!

903
00:58:14,741 --> 00:58:17,286
No, please! Please!

904
00:58:17,328 --> 00:58:20,331
This is supposed
to be a happy occasion!

905
00:58:20,372 --> 00:58:25,002
Let's not bicker and argue
about who killed who.

906
00:58:25,043 --> 00:58:29,673
We are here today to witness
the union of two young people

907
00:58:29,714 --> 00:58:32,259
in the joyful bond
of a holy wedlock.

908
00:58:33,802 --> 00:58:38,223
Unfortunately, one of them,
my son Herbert,

909
00:58:38,265 --> 00:58:41,518
-has just fallen to his death.
-[people groan]

910
00:58:41,559 --> 00:58:45,105
But I don't want to think
I've lost a son, so much as...

911
00:58:45,147 --> 00:58:47,441
gained a daughter.

912
00:58:47,483 --> 00:58:50,902
For, since the tragic death
of her father--

913
00:58:50,944 --> 00:58:52,363
He's not quite dead!

914
00:58:52,404 --> 00:58:54,239
[people gasp]

915
00:58:54,281 --> 00:58:57,534
Since the near fatal wounding
of her father--

916
00:58:57,575 --> 00:58:58,702
He's getting better!

917
00:59:01,163 --> 00:59:04,541
For, since her own father,

918
00:59:04,582 --> 00:59:08,295
who, when he seemed
about to recover,

919
00:59:08,337 --> 00:59:11,465
suddenly felt the icy
hand of death upon him.

920
00:59:11,507 --> 00:59:14,426
-[man groans]
-Oh, he's died!

921
00:59:14,468 --> 00:59:18,096
I want his only daughter
to look upon me

922
00:59:18,138 --> 00:59:23,018
as her own dad, in a very real,
and legally binding sense.

923
00:59:25,103 --> 00:59:26,855
And I feel sure
that the merger--

924
00:59:26,897 --> 00:59:29,774
the union between the Princess

925
00:59:29,816 --> 00:59:33,820
and the brave but dangerous
Sir Lancelot of Camelot...

926
00:59:33,862 --> 00:59:37,157
-What?
-Look, the dead prince!

927
00:59:39,784 --> 00:59:43,539
-He's not quite dead!
-I feel much better.

928
00:59:43,580 --> 00:59:46,166
You fell out of the tall tower,
you creep!

929
00:59:46,208 --> 00:59:49,336
No, I was saved
at the last minute.

-The knights who say "Ni"!

we can buy a shrubbery,

Oh, what sad times are these
when passing ruffians

964

at will to old ladies.

There is a pestilence upon
this land. Nothing is sacred.

Even those who arrange
and design shrubberies

967

are under considerable
economic stress

968
01:01:55,212 --> 01:01:57,130

brought you your shrubbery.

-May we go now?
-It is a good shrubbery.

01:02:17,359 --> 01:02:21,821

But there is one small problem.

What is this test, oh Knights
who until recently said "Ni"?

985
01:02:41,675 --> 01:02:44,720
Firstly, you must find...

986
01:02:44,761 --> 01:02:46,971

-Not another shrubbery!

Then, when you have found
the shrubbery,

989
01:02:51,643 --> 01:02:53,978
you must place it here
beside this shrubbery.

990
01:02:54,020 --> 01:02:56,064
Only slightly higher,
so you get the two-level effect

991

the middle.

A path! A path!

01:02:59,817 --> 01:03:03,321
Then, when you have found
the shrubberies,

994
01:03:03,363 --> 01:03:07,409
you must cut down the mightiest
tree in the forest

995
01:03:07,451 --> 01:03:09,536
with...

996
01:03:09,578 --> 01:03:12,247

-We shall do no such thing.
-Oh, please.

I cannot tell.
Suffice to say,

01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:26,803
it's one of the words
the Knights of Ni cannot hear.

I've said "it." I've said "it."
I've said "it" again!

1022
01:04:15,686 --> 01:04:17,145
And there again,
that's three "its"!

Knights...

1046
01:05:46,067 --> 01:05:47,026
forward!

[explosion]

1048
01:06:24,731 --> 01:06:26,983
What manner of man are you
that can summon up fire

1049
01:06:27,024 --> 01:06:30,111
-without flint or tinder?
-I...

1050
01:06:30,153 --> 01:06:31,655
am an enchanter.

1051
01:06:34,449 --> 01:06:38,328
-By what name are you known?
-There are some who call me...

1052
01:06:40,413 --> 01:06:43,166
-Tim.
-Greetings, Tim the Enchanter!

1053
01:06:43,207 --> 01:06:45,335
Greetings, King Arthur.

1054
01:06:46,461 --> 01:06:48,338
-You know my name?
-I do.

1055
01:06:56,095 --> 01:06:58,849
You seek the Holy Grail.

1056
01:06:58,890 --> 01:07:02,310
That is our quest. You know
much that is hidden, oh Tim.

1057
01:07:02,352 --> 01:07:03,728
Quite.

1058
01:07:12,069 --> 01:07:14,739
Yes, we are looking
for the Holy Grail.

1059
01:07:14,781 --> 01:07:16,783
Our quest
is to find the Holy Grail.

1060
01:07:16,825 --> 01:07:18,994
Yes, it is.

1061
01:07:21,913 --> 01:07:25,667
-And so we're looking for it.
-Yes, we are.

1062
01:07:25,709 --> 01:07:27,669
-We have been for some time.
-Ages.

1063
01:07:30,714 --> 01:07:35,134
So, anything you could do
to help would be...

1064
01:07:37,679 --> 01:07:41,098
very... helpful.

1065
01:07:41,140 --> 01:07:42,642
Look, can you tell us where--?

1066
01:07:46,646 --> 01:07:49,733
Fine, I don't want to waste
any more of your time,

1067
01:07:49,774 --> 01:07:52,318
but I don't suppose
you could tell us

1068
01:07:52,360 --> 01:07:56,447
where we might find a...
find a... a, uh...

1069
01:07:56,489 --> 01:07:58,491
A what?

1070
01:07:58,533 --> 01:08:00,911
A g... A g...

1071
01:08:00,952 --> 01:08:02,078
A Grail?

1072
01:08:02,119 --> 01:08:03,788
Yes, I think so.

1073
01:08:04,873 --> 01:08:07,584
[all] Yes.

1074
01:08:07,625 --> 01:08:09,044
Yes!

1075
01:08:10,420 --> 01:08:12,380
-Oh. Thank you.
-Splendid!

1076
01:08:16,927 --> 01:08:20,137
Look, you're a busy man--

1077
01:08:20,179 --> 01:08:24,434
Yes, I can help you
find the Holy Grail.

1078
01:08:24,475 --> 01:08:26,102
Oh, thank you.

1079
01:08:26,143 --> 01:08:29,814
To the north, there lies a cave.
The Cave of Caerbannog.

1080
01:08:29,856 --> 01:08:34,569
Wherein, carved in mystic runes,
upon the very living rock,

1081
01:08:34,611 --> 01:08:38,364
the last words
of Olfin Bedwere of Rheged...

1082
01:08:38,406 --> 01:08:40,491
[thunderous explosion]

1083
01:08:40,533 --> 01:08:45,329
...make plain the last resting
place of the most Holy Grail.

1084
01:08:45,371 --> 01:08:47,749
Where could we find
this cave, oh Tim?

1085
01:08:47,791 --> 01:08:49,042
Follow!

1086
01:08:50,543 --> 01:08:54,672
But follow only
if ye be men of valor.

1087
01:08:54,714 --> 01:08:59,052
For the entrance to this cave
is guarded by a creature

1088
01:08:59,094 --> 01:09:02,263
so foul, so cruel,

1089
01:09:02,305 --> 01:09:06,726
that no man yet has fought
with it and lived.

1090
01:09:06,768 --> 01:09:12,649
Bones of full 50 men lie
strewn about its lair.

1091
01:09:12,690 --> 01:09:17,528
So, brave knights,
if you do doubt your courage

1092
01:09:17,570 --> 01:09:20,698
or your strength,
come no further,

1093
01:09:20,740 --> 01:09:26,079
for death awaits you all
with nasty, big, pointy teeth.

1094
01:09:28,247 --> 01:09:30,083
What an eccentric performance.

1095
01:09:41,803 --> 01:09:43,596
[horse whinny sounds]

1096
01:09:43,638 --> 01:09:45,306
They're nervous, sire.

1097
01:09:45,348 --> 01:09:47,809
Then we'd best leave them here
and carry on, on foot.

1098
01:09:47,851 --> 01:09:49,268
Dismount!

1099
01:09:54,899 --> 01:09:59,154
[deep breathing sound]

1100
01:10:02,406 --> 01:10:06,410
Behold the Cave of Caerbannog!

1101
01:10:08,830 --> 01:10:12,667
-Right, keep me covered.
-What with?

1102
01:10:12,709 --> 01:10:14,544
-Just keep me covered.
-Too late.

1103
01:10:16,671 --> 01:10:17,672
There he is!

1104
01:10:20,800 --> 01:10:22,259
-Where?
-There.

1105
01:10:23,887 --> 01:10:25,221
What, behind the rabbit?

1106
01:10:25,262 --> 01:10:27,598
It is the rabbit.

1107
01:10:29,142 --> 01:10:31,561
-You silly sod!
-What?

1108
01:10:31,602 --> 01:10:33,188
You got us all worked up.

1109
01:10:33,229 --> 01:10:35,272
That's no ordinary rabbit.

1110
01:10:35,314 --> 01:10:38,985
That's the most foul, cruel
and bad-tempered rodent

1111
01:10:39,027 --> 01:10:40,361
you ever set eyes on.

1112
01:10:40,403 --> 01:10:43,781
You tit! I soiled my armor
I was so scared!

1113
01:10:43,823 --> 01:10:47,368
Look, that rabbit's got
a vicious streak a mile wide.

1114
01:10:47,410 --> 01:10:49,453
-It's a killer!
-Get stuffed.

1115
01:10:49,495 --> 01:10:51,873
-He'll do you up a treat, mate!
-Yeah?

1116
01:10:51,915 --> 01:10:54,458
-You manky Scots git!
-I'm warning you.

1117
01:10:54,500 --> 01:10:58,213
-What's he do? Nibble your bum?
-He's got huge, sharp...

1118
01:10:59,296 --> 01:11:01,424
It can leap about...

1119
01:11:01,465 --> 01:11:03,259
Look at the bones!

1120
01:11:03,300 --> 01:11:05,220
Go on, Bors, chop its head off.

1121
01:11:05,261 --> 01:11:08,973
Right. Silly little bleeder.
One rabbit stew coming right up.

1122

-Look!
-[rabbit squeaks]

1123
01:11:15,396 --> 01:11:18,649
-Jesus Christ!
-I warned you!

1124
01:11:18,691 --> 01:11:20,777
-I've done it again.
-I warned you.

1125
01:11:20,818 --> 01:11:24,280
But did you listen to me?
No, you knew it all, didn't you?

1126
01:11:24,321 --> 01:11:26,991
Oh, it's just a harmless
little bunny, isn't it?

1127
01:11:27,033 --> 01:11:29,869
Well, it's always the same.
I always--

1128
01:11:29,911 --> 01:11:33,123
-Oh, shut up!
-Do they listen to me? Oh no.

1129
01:11:33,164 --> 01:11:35,917
-Charge!
-[men shout]

1130

[men scream]

1131
01:11:51,515 --> 01:11:55,352
Run away! Run away!

1132
01:11:57,188 --> 01:11:58,397
[laughs]

1133
01:12:03,402 --> 01:12:05,529
-Right. How many did we lose?
-Gawain.

1134
01:12:05,571 --> 01:12:07,657
-Ector.
-And Bors. That's five.

1135
01:12:07,698 --> 01:12:09,993
-Three, sir.
-Three. Three.

1136
01:12:10,034 --> 01:12:11,702
We better not risk
another frontal assault,

1137
01:12:11,744 --> 01:12:13,746
that rabbit's dynamite.

1138
01:12:13,788 --> 01:12:16,415
Would it help to confuse it
if we run away more?

1139
01:12:16,457 --> 01:12:19,919
-Shut up and change your armor.
-Let us taunt it.

1140
01:12:19,961 --> 01:12:22,880
It may become so cross
that it will make a mistake.

1141
01:12:22,922 --> 01:12:24,048
Like what?

1142
01:12:25,341 --> 01:12:26,425
Well...

1143
01:12:29,470 --> 01:12:31,430
-Have we got bows?
-No.

1144
01:12:31,472 --> 01:12:33,933
-We have the Holy Hand Grenade.
-Yes, of course!

1145
01:12:33,975 --> 01:12:35,768
The Holy Hand Grenade
of Antioch.

1146
01:12:35,810 --> 01:12:37,103
It's one of the sacred relics

1147
01:12:37,145 --> 01:12:38,688
Brother Maynard
carries with him.

1148
01:12:38,729 --> 01:12:41,816
Brother Maynard!
Bring up the Holy Hand Grenade.

1149
01:12:43,526 --> 01:12:46,946
[religious choir chanting]

1150
01:13:13,348 --> 01:13:16,934
How does it...
How does it work?

1151
01:13:16,976 --> 01:13:19,436
-I know not, my liege.
-[Arthur] Consult the Book
of Armaments.

1152

Armaments chapter 2:
verses 9-21.

1153
01:13:26,569 --> 01:13:31,241
"And St. Attila raised the hand
grenade up on high, saying,

'O Lord,
bless this thy hand grenade,

Skip a bit, Brother.

"And the Lord spake, saying,

'First shalt thou take out
the Holy Pin,

then shalt thou count
to three, no more, no less.

1164
01:14:05,482 --> 01:14:07,902
Three shalt be the number
thou shalt count,

1165
01:14:07,944 --> 01:14:10,654
and the number
of the counting shalt be three.

1166

Four shalt thou not count,
neither count thou two,

then proceed to three.

Five is right out.

-Of course.
-What does it say?

"The Castle of Aaargh."

1191
01:16:13,319 --> 01:16:14,987
What is that?

1192
01:16:15,029 --> 01:16:17,323
He must have died
while carving it.

1193
01:16:17,365 --> 01:16:20,243
-Oh, come on!
-Well, that's what it says.

1194
01:16:20,284 --> 01:16:22,078
Look, if he was dying,
he wouldn't bother

1195
01:16:22,119 --> 01:16:24,080
to carve "Aaargh."

1196
01:16:24,121 --> 01:16:25,540
He'd just say it.

1197
01:16:25,581 --> 01:16:27,583
That's what's carved
in the rock.

1198
01:16:27,624 --> 01:16:29,919
-Perhaps he was dictating it.
-Oh shut up!

1199
01:16:29,960 --> 01:16:32,380
-Does it say anything else?
-No!

1200
01:16:32,422 --> 01:16:35,632
Just "Aaargh."

1201
01:16:37,634 --> 01:16:40,012
-Aaargh.
-Aaargh.

1202
01:16:40,054 --> 01:16:43,849
Do you suppose
he meant the Camargue?

1203
01:16:43,891 --> 01:16:45,935
-Where's that?
-In France, I think.

1204
01:16:45,976 --> 01:16:49,146
Isn't there a St. Aaargh's
in Cornwall?

1205
01:16:49,188 --> 01:16:50,647
No, that's St. Ives.

1206
01:16:50,689 --> 01:16:53,484
-Oh, yes. St. Ives.
-St. Ives.

1207
01:16:53,526 --> 01:16:55,361
Ooooh!

1208
01:16:55,403 --> 01:16:57,613
No, "Aaargh."
At the back of the throat.

1209
01:16:57,654 --> 01:17:01,367
No no no,
"Ooh," in surprise and alarm!

1210
01:17:01,409 --> 01:17:04,078
-You mean a sort of an "Ah!"
-Yes, that's right.

1211
01:17:04,120 --> 01:17:05,871
-Aaah!
-Oh!

1212
01:17:05,913 --> 01:17:06,997

It's the legendary
Black Beast of...

Aaah!

1216
01:17:14,380 --> 01:17:16,673
That's it! That's it!

1219
01:17:27,684 --> 01:17:28,894
Keep running.

-The Bridge of Death.
-Oh, great.

1230
01:18:12,021 --> 01:18:15,149
Look! There's the old man
from Scene 24.

1231
01:18:15,191 --> 01:18:17,026
What's he doing here?

1232
01:18:17,067 --> 01:18:19,362
He is the keeper
of the Bridge of Death.

1233
01:18:19,403 --> 01:18:21,738
He asks each traveler
five questions.

1234
01:18:21,780 --> 01:18:23,824
-Three questions.
-Three questions.

1235
01:18:23,866 --> 01:18:26,452

the five questions--

Three questions.

1237
01:18:27,870 --> 01:18:30,289
...three questions,
may cross in safety.

1238
01:18:30,331 --> 01:18:31,999
What if you get
a question wrong?

1239
01:18:32,041 --> 01:18:35,711
Then you are cast
into the Gorge of Eternal Peril.

1240
01:18:35,752 --> 01:18:37,254
Oh, wacko.

1241
01:18:37,296 --> 01:18:39,048
Who's going to answer
the questions?

1242
01:18:39,089 --> 01:18:40,716
-Sir Robin?
-Yes?

1243
01:18:40,757 --> 01:18:42,677
Brave Sir Robin, you go.

1244
01:18:42,718 --> 01:18:45,346
Hey!
I've got a great idea.

1245
01:18:45,388 --> 01:18:47,097
Why doesn't Lancelot go?

1246
01:18:47,139 --> 01:18:49,725
Yes, let me go, my liege.
I will take him single-handed.

1247
01:18:49,766 --> 01:18:51,310
I shall make a feint
to the northeast--

1248
01:18:51,352 --> 01:18:53,646
No. Hang on! Hang on!

1249
01:18:53,688 --> 01:18:55,439
Just answer
the five questions--

1250
01:18:55,481 --> 01:18:56,732
Three questions.

1251
01:18:56,773 --> 01:18:57,983
...three questions,
as best you can.

1252
01:18:58,025 --> 01:19:00,653
And we shall
watch and pray.

1253
01:19:00,695 --> 01:19:02,655
I understand, my liege.

1254
01:19:02,697 --> 01:19:06,283
Good luck, brave Sir Lancelot.
God be with you.

the Bridge of Death,

must answer me
these questions three.

1258

Ere the other side he see.

1259
01:19:20,631 --> 01:19:23,426
Ask me the questions,
Bridgekeeper. I'm not afraid.

01:19:23,467 --> 01:19:25,761
What is your name?

1261

To seek the Holy Grail.

-Blue.
-Right. Off you go.

1266

Well, thank you.
Thank you very much.

What do you mean?
An African or European swallow?

How do you know
so much about swallows?

has guided us.

1323
01:25:16,152 --> 01:25:18,864
So, you think you could

1326
01:25:22,367 --> 01:25:25,412
I wave my private parts
at your aunties.

You cheesy lot of second-hand,
electric donkey-bottom biters!

1328
01:25:30,292 --> 01:25:32,461
In the name of the Lord,

to this sacred castle!

If you'll
not open this door,

1335
01:25:48,560 --> 01:25:50,771
we shall take this castle
by force!

Yes, depart at this time, and
don't be approaching any more,

And now remain gone,
illegitimate-faced bugger-folk!

a nasty taunting this time,

Today the blood of many a
valiant knight shall be avenged.

we shall not stop our fight
