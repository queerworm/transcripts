He's dead.

Oh! Poor Daddy.

00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,480

be catching the 11:30 now.

Oh, no, John,
you mustn't miss your train.

Oh, John, thank you.

190

Anyway, you could always
catch the 9:30 tomorrow.

191
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:02,520
It goes via Caterham

Oh, who could have
done this?

197
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:15,680
Oh, do hurry, Sir Horace, your
train leaves in 28 minutes,

198
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:18,080
and if you don't catch the
10:15, you won't catch the 3:45,

I'm afraid you can cancel

Oh, and it was back to the

205
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,440

214
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:53,320
I got the 8:55 Pullman Express
from King's Cross,

215
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,120

-Yes, after breakfast.

Exactly.

222
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:14,200

Just a minute, Tony.

There's a small matter
of... murder.

225
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:20,440
Oh, but surely he simply shot
himself and then hid the gun.

226
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:23,120
How could anyone shoot himself
and then hide the gun,

227
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:25,280
without first canceling
his reservation?

00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:26,880
Aha...

00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:29,080
Well, I must dash

I may have had
the motive, inspector,

232
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:35,840
but I could not
have done it.

233
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:38,160
For I have only just arrived
from Gillingham on the 8:13,

234
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:40,200
and here's my restaurant car
ticket to prove it.

235
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,920
But the 8:13 from Gillingham
doesn't have a restaurant car.

236
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:44,960
It's a standing buffet only.

237
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,760
Uh, did I say the 8:13? I meant
the 7:58 stopping train.

238
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:53,360
But the 7:58 stopping train
arrived at Swindon at 8:19,

239
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:56,960
owing to annual
point maintenance
at Wisborough Junction.

240
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,640
So how did you make the
connection with the 8:13,

241
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,320

earlier?

244

I did it.
