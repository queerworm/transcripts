I'm finished with you!
-Shh!

176
00:09:53,051 --> 00:09:55,262
Who hit yours then,
Goliath's big brother?

177
00:09:55,303 --> 00:09:57,180
Oh! Right,
that's your last warning.

178
00:09:57,222 --> 00:09:58,639
Oh, do pipe down.

179
00:09:58,681 --> 00:09:59,849
Oh!

180
00:09:59,891 --> 00:10:01,476
[both grunting]

181
00:10:01,518 --> 00:10:03,103
Silly bitch,
getting in the way.

182
00:10:03,144 --> 00:10:05,939
[all grunting]

183
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:07,482
Break it up!

184
00:10:07,524 --> 00:10:10,777
-Oh, come on,
let's go to the stoning.
-All right.

185
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:15,865
Well, blessed is
just about everyone

186
00:10:15,907 --> 00:10:19,160
with a vested interest
in the status quo,
as far as I can tell, Reg.

187
00:10:19,202 --> 00:10:21,746
Yeah. Well, what Jesus
blatantly fails to appreciate

188
00:10:21,788 --> 00:10:23,540
is it's the meek
who are the problem.

189
00:10:23,582 --> 00:10:28,044
Yes, yes. Absolutely, Reg.
Yes, I see.

190
00:10:28,086 --> 00:10:31,965
Oh, come on, Brian,
or they'll have stoned him
before we get there.

191
00:10:32,006 --> 00:10:33,967
-All right.
-[commotion continues]

192
00:10:34,008 --> 00:10:37,053
Hey, get off her.
That's disgusting.
Stop trying to do that.

193
00:10:37,095 --> 00:10:39,514
Officer, intervene here.
Attempted rape going on.

194
00:10:39,556 --> 00:10:42,517
It's the chap with
the big nose's fault.
He started it all.

195
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:43,560
[gasps]

196
00:10:43,602 --> 00:10:45,979
Oh, I hate wearing these beards.

197
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:48,565
Why aren't women
allowed to go to stonings, Mum?

198
00:10:48,607 --> 00:10:50,400
It's written, that's why.

199
00:10:51,692 --> 00:10:53,069
-Beard, madam?
-Oh, look,

200
00:10:53,111 --> 00:10:55,447
I haven't got time
to go to no stonings.

201
00:10:55,489 --> 00:10:57,240
He's not well again.

202
00:10:57,282 --> 00:10:58,158
[donkey braying]

203
00:10:58,199 --> 00:10:59,951
Stone, sir?

204
00:10:59,993 --> 00:11:02,245
No, they've got them up there
lying around on the ground.

205
00:11:02,287 --> 00:11:04,038
Oh, not like these, sir.
Look at these.

206
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,374
Feel the quality of that.
That's craftsmanship, sir.

207
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:08,209
Hmm... uh...

208
00:11:08,251 --> 00:11:11,630
All right. We'll have two with
points and a big, flat one.

209
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:13,548
-Could I have a flat one, Mum?
-Shh!

210
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:14,799
Sorry. Dad.

211
00:11:14,841 --> 00:11:17,511
All right.
Two points, two flats

212
00:11:17,552 --> 00:11:19,762
-and a packet of gravel.
-Packet of gravel.

213
00:11:19,804 --> 00:11:21,473
-Should be a good one
this afternoon.
-Yeah?

214
00:11:21,515 --> 00:11:23,266
-Local boy.
-Oh, good.

215
00:11:23,308 --> 00:11:24,601
Enjoy yourselves.

216
00:11:24,643 --> 00:11:26,978
[people shouting angrily]

217
00:11:40,741 --> 00:11:43,244
[shouting fades]

218
00:11:43,286 --> 00:11:46,331
Matthias, son of
Deuteronomy of Gath...

219
00:11:46,373 --> 00:11:47,248
Do I say yes?

220
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:49,000
-Yes!
-Yes!

221
00:11:49,042 --> 00:11:52,546
...you have been found guilty
by the elders of the town

222
00:11:52,587 --> 00:11:55,549
of uttering
the name of our Lord,

223
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:58,468
and so as a blasphemer...

224
00:11:58,510 --> 00:11:59,553
[crowd gasps]

225
00:11:59,594 --> 00:12:02,305
...you are to be
stoned to death!

226
00:12:02,347 --> 00:12:03,682
[all murmuring]

227
00:12:03,722 --> 00:12:05,850
Look, I'd had
a lovely supper,

228
00:12:05,892 --> 00:12:07,768
and all I said
to my wife was,

229
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:10,397
"That piece of halibut was
good enough for Jehovah."

230
00:12:10,438 --> 00:12:11,565
[all gasp]

231
00:12:11,606 --> 00:12:14,067
Blasphemy!
He said it again!

232
00:12:14,108 --> 00:12:16,027
[all shout in agreement]

233
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:18,737
-Did you hear him?
-[all shout in feminine voices]
Yeah! Yes, we did!

234
00:12:18,779 --> 00:12:20,114
[high-pitched scream] Really!

235
00:12:24,202 --> 00:12:25,953
Are there any women here today?

236
00:12:25,995 --> 00:12:29,207
[quietly] No, no, no.

237
00:12:31,876 --> 00:12:32,919
Very well.

238
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:35,296
By virtue of the authority

239
00:12:35,338 --> 00:12:37,716
-vested in me...
-Ow!

240
00:12:37,756 --> 00:12:39,967
Lay off!
We haven't started yet.

241
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:41,760
Come on! Who threw that?

242
00:12:43,346 --> 00:12:45,764
Who threw that stone? Come on!

243
00:12:45,806 --> 00:12:47,392
[all in feminine voices]
She did! She did!

244
00:12:47,434 --> 00:12:50,270
[all continue in masculine
voices] He did! He did! He did!

245
00:12:50,311 --> 00:12:52,647
Sorry, I thought we'd started.

246
00:12:52,689 --> 00:12:55,567
-Go to the back.
-Oh, dear.

247
00:12:55,609 --> 00:12:58,236
Always one, isn't there?

248
00:12:58,278 --> 00:13:00,113
Now, where were we?

249
00:13:00,154 --> 00:13:03,491
Look, I don't think
it ought to be blasphemy
just saying "Jehovah".

250
00:13:03,533 --> 00:13:05,159
-[angry shouting]
-[all shout in feminine
voices] He did it again!

251
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:07,786
You're only making it
worse for yourself!

252
00:13:07,828 --> 00:13:10,582
Making it worse?!
How could it be worse?

253
00:13:10,624 --> 00:13:13,334
-Jehovah! Jehovah! Jehovah!
-[crowd gasps]

254
00:13:13,376 --> 00:13:17,255
I'm warning you!
If you say Jehovah once more--

255
00:13:17,297 --> 00:13:19,966
Right! Who threw that?

256
00:13:21,175 --> 00:13:22,636
Come on! Who threw that?

257
00:13:22,677 --> 00:13:24,721
[all shouting
in feminine voices]

258
00:13:24,763 --> 00:13:27,974
[all continue
in masculine voices]
Him! Him! Him!

259
00:13:28,015 --> 00:13:29,643
-Was it you?
-Yes.

260
00:13:29,684 --> 00:13:31,269
-Right--
-Well, you did say Jehovah.

261
00:13:31,311 --> 00:13:33,480
[high-pitched screaming]

262
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:38,901
Stop! Stop!
Will you stop that?!

263
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:40,278
Stop it!

264
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:43,990
Now, look! No one is to
stone anyone

265
00:13:44,031 --> 00:13:47,577
until I blow this whistle!
Do you understand?

266
00:13:47,619 --> 00:13:50,789
Even, and I want to
make this absolutely clear,

267
00:13:50,829 --> 00:13:53,040
even if they do say "Jehovah"!

268
00:13:53,082 --> 00:13:54,917
[screaming resumes]

269
00:13:56,336 --> 00:13:59,673
-[all] Whoa, whoa, whoa!
-[thudding]

270
00:13:59,714 --> 00:14:01,758
-[crowd applauds]
-[woman] Good shot!

271
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,842
[cheers, applause continue]

272
00:14:05,345 --> 00:14:07,430
[dramatic music]

273
00:14:12,851 --> 00:14:16,439
-Have I got a big nose, Mum?
-Oh, stop thinking about sex.

274
00:14:16,481 --> 00:14:18,817
-I wasn't!
-You're always on about it.

275
00:14:18,857 --> 00:14:20,401
Morning, noon and night.

276
00:14:20,443 --> 00:14:23,112
"Will the girls like this,
will the girls like that?

277
00:14:23,154 --> 00:14:26,157
Is it too big,
is it too small?"

278
00:14:26,199 --> 00:14:28,159
[indistinct chattering]

279
00:14:28,201 --> 00:14:31,954
-Alms for a leper.
-Alms for a leper.

280
00:14:31,996 --> 00:14:34,749
Alms for an ex-leper.

281
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:37,084
Bloody donkey-owners,
all the same, ain't they?

282
00:14:37,126 --> 00:14:38,837
Never have any change.

283
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:40,839
Oh, here's a touch.

284
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,465
Spare a talent
for an old ex-leper?

285
00:14:42,507 --> 00:14:43,966
Buzz off!

286
00:14:44,008 --> 00:14:45,719
Spare a talent
for an old ex-leper?

287
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:48,388
A talent? That's more than
he earns in a month.

288
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:50,306
-Half a talent then?
-No, go away.

289
00:14:50,348 --> 00:14:52,183
-Come on, big nose,
let's haggle.
-What?

290
00:14:52,225 --> 00:14:54,477
All right, cut the haggling,
say you open at one shekel,

291
00:14:54,519 --> 00:14:56,813
I start at 2000,
we close about 1800.

292
00:14:56,855 --> 00:14:57,980
-No.
-Seventeen fifty?

293
00:14:58,022 --> 00:15:00,233
-Go away!
-Seventeen forty?

294
00:15:00,274 --> 00:15:01,609
Will you leave him alone!

295
00:15:01,651 --> 00:15:02,694
All right.
Two shekels, just two.

296
00:15:02,736 --> 00:15:04,028
Is this fun, eh?

297
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:05,905
Look,
he's not giving you any money.

298
00:15:05,946 --> 00:15:07,490
Now piss off!

299
00:15:11,661 --> 00:15:14,163
All right, final offer,
half a shekel for an ex-leper?

300
00:15:14,205 --> 00:15:16,207
Did you say "ex-leper"?

301
00:15:16,249 --> 00:15:18,793
That's right, sir, 16 years
behind a bell and proud of it,
sir.

302
00:15:18,835 --> 00:15:21,421
-Well, what happened?
-I was cured, sir.

303
00:15:21,462 --> 00:15:23,214
-Cured?
-Yes, a bloody miracle, sir.

304
00:15:23,256 --> 00:15:25,383
-God bless you.
-Who cured you?

305
00:15:25,425 --> 00:15:26,967
Jesus did, sir.

306
00:15:27,009 --> 00:15:28,969
I was hopping along,
minding my own business.

307
00:15:29,011 --> 00:15:31,305
All of a sudden,
up he comes, cures me.

308
00:15:31,347 --> 00:15:33,057
One minute
I'm a leper with a trade,

309
00:15:33,099 --> 00:15:34,517
next minute
my livelihood's gone.

310
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:36,143
Not so much as a
"by your leave."

311
00:15:36,185 --> 00:15:38,688
"You're cured, mate."
Bloody do-gooder.

312
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:40,732
Well, why don't you
go and tell him

313
00:15:40,774 --> 00:15:42,483
that you want to be
a leper again?

314
00:15:42,525 --> 00:15:44,736
I could do that, sir.
Yeah, I could that, I suppose.

315
00:15:44,778 --> 00:15:46,571
What I was thinking was gonna
ask him if he'd make me

316
00:15:46,613 --> 00:15:48,573
a bit lame in one leg
during the middle of the week.

317
00:15:48,615 --> 00:15:50,658
You know, something beggable,
but not leprosy,

318
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:52,744
which is a pain in the ass,
to be blunt.
Excuse my French, sir.

319
00:15:52,786 --> 00:15:56,790
Brian.
Come and clean your room out.

320
00:15:56,831 --> 00:15:58,499
-There you are.
-Thank you, sir. Thank...

321
00:15:58,541 --> 00:16:01,711
Half a denarii
for me bloody life story?

322
00:16:01,753 --> 00:16:03,755
There's no pleasing
some people.

323
00:16:03,797 --> 00:16:05,757
That's just what
Jesus said, sir.

324
00:16:17,811 --> 00:16:20,855
-Oh!
-Good afternoon.

325
00:16:20,897 --> 00:16:22,482
Oh, uh,
hello, officer.

326
00:16:22,523 --> 00:16:27,403
Uh... I'll be with you in a few
moments, all right, dear?

327
00:16:27,445 --> 00:16:28,863
What's he doing here?

328
00:16:28,905 --> 00:16:30,949
Don't start that, Brian.
Go clean your room out.

329
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:32,408
Bloody Romans.

330
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:34,535
Now, look, Brian,
if it wasn't for them,

331
00:16:34,577 --> 00:16:37,413
we wouldn't have all this.
And don't you forget it.

332
00:16:37,455 --> 00:16:39,415
We don't owe
the Romans anything, Mum.

333
00:16:39,457 --> 00:16:42,168
Well, that's not entirely true,
is it, Brian?

334
00:16:42,209 --> 00:16:43,920
What do you mean?

335
00:16:43,962 --> 00:16:46,422
Well, you know when you
were asking me about your, uh--

336
00:16:46,464 --> 00:16:47,966
-My nose?
-Yes.

337
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:50,510
Well, there's a reason
it's like it is, Brian.

338
00:16:50,551 --> 00:16:52,428
What is it?

339
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:56,933
-Well, I suppose I should have
told you a long time ago, but...
-What?

340
00:16:56,975 --> 00:16:58,476
Well, Brian...

341
00:16:59,978 --> 00:17:02,146
your father
isn't Mr. Cohen.

342
00:17:02,188 --> 00:17:04,774
-I never thought he was.
-Now, none of your cheek!

343
00:17:04,816 --> 00:17:07,485
He was a Roman, Brian.

344
00:17:07,527 --> 00:17:10,655
He was a centurion
in the Roman army.

345
00:17:10,697 --> 00:17:12,991
You mean you were raped?!

346
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:15,034
Well, at first, yes.

347
00:17:15,075 --> 00:17:16,369
Who was it?

348
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:19,079
Naughtius Maximus
his name was. Hmm.

349
00:17:19,121 --> 00:17:21,499
Promised me the known world,
he did.

350
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:24,711
I was to be taken to Rome,
house by the Forum,

351
00:17:24,752 --> 00:17:26,546
slaves, asses' milk,

352
00:17:26,587 --> 00:17:29,131
as much gold
as I could eat.

353
00:17:29,173 --> 00:17:31,676
Then he,
having his way with me he had,

354
00:17:31,718 --> 00:17:34,136
boom, like a rat
out of an aqueduct.

355
00:17:34,178 --> 00:17:35,680
The bastard!

356
00:17:35,722 --> 00:17:38,474
Yes, and next time you go on
about the "bloody Romans"

357
00:17:38,516 --> 00:17:40,434
don't forget
you're one of them.

358
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:42,020
I'm not a Roman, Mum.

359
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:43,396
And I never will be.

360
00:17:43,437 --> 00:17:46,774
I'm a kike, a yid,
a hebe, a hooknose.

361
00:17:46,816 --> 00:17:48,026
I'm kosher, Mum.

362
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:51,779
I'm a Red Sea pedestrian
and proud of it!

363
00:17:52,864 --> 00:17:54,365
[door slams]

364
00:17:54,407 --> 00:17:55,825
[chuckles]

365
00:17:55,867 --> 00:17:58,494
Sex, sex, sex, that's all
they think about, huh?

366
00:17:58,536 --> 00:18:01,039
Well, how are you then, officer?

367
00:18:02,122 --> 00:18:05,710
[plays fanfare]

368
00:18:11,007 --> 00:18:12,717
[light applause]

369
00:18:12,759 --> 00:18:15,261
[quiet chattering]

370
00:18:18,765 --> 00:18:21,017
[announcer]
Ladies and gentlemen,

371
00:18:21,059 --> 00:18:24,812
the next contest is between

372
00:18:24,854 --> 00:18:30,484
Frank Goliath,
the Macedonian baby-crusher,

373
00:18:30,526 --> 00:18:33,654
and Boris Mineburg.

374
00:18:33,696 --> 00:18:35,949
[Brian] Thank you, madam.

375
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:37,533
Larks' tongues.

376
00:18:37,575 --> 00:18:39,201
Wrens' livers.

377
00:18:39,243 --> 00:18:41,370
Chaffinch brains.

378
00:18:41,412 --> 00:18:43,623
Jaguars' earlobes.

379
00:18:43,664 --> 00:18:45,124
Wolf-nipple chips.

380
00:18:45,165 --> 00:18:46,500
Get them while they're hot.
They're lovely.

381
00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:49,003
Dromedary pretzels,
only half a dinar.

382
00:18:49,045 --> 00:18:50,630
Tuscany fried bats...

383
00:18:50,671 --> 00:18:54,050
I do feel, Reg, that any
anti-imperialist group like ours

384
00:18:54,092 --> 00:18:58,137
must reflect such
a divergence of interest
within its power base.

385
00:18:58,178 --> 00:18:59,722
Agreed. Francis?

386
00:18:59,764 --> 00:19:01,891
Yeah, I think Judith's point
of view is very valid, Reg,

387
00:19:01,933 --> 00:19:03,726
provided the movement
never forgets

388
00:19:03,768 --> 00:19:06,145
that it is the unalienable
right of every man...

389
00:19:06,186 --> 00:19:08,397
-Or woman.
-...or woman, to rid himself...

390
00:19:08,439 --> 00:19:09,607
-Or herself.
-...or herself--

391
00:19:09,649 --> 00:19:10,817
-Agreed.
-Thank you, brother.

392
00:19:10,858 --> 00:19:12,944
-Or sister.
-Or sister...

393
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:15,613
Where was I?

394
00:19:16,697 --> 00:19:17,740
I think you finished.

395
00:19:17,782 --> 00:19:19,366
Oh, right.

396
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:21,368
Furthermore, it is the
birthright of every man...

397
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:23,412
Or woman.

398
00:19:23,454 --> 00:19:25,331
Why don't you shut up
about women, Stan,
you're putting us off.

399
00:19:25,372 --> 00:19:28,084
Women have a perfect right
to play a part in our movement,
Reg.

400
00:19:28,126 --> 00:19:31,211
Why are you always
on about women, Stan?

401
00:19:31,253 --> 00:19:32,421
I want to be one.

402
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:36,050
What?

403
00:19:36,092 --> 00:19:38,218
I want to be a woman.

404
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:42,723
From now on, I want you
all to call me "Loretta".

405
00:19:42,765 --> 00:19:43,808
What?!

406
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:45,476
It's my right
as a man.

407
00:19:45,518 --> 00:19:50,230
Well, why do you want
to be Loretta, Stan?

408
00:19:50,272 --> 00:19:52,025
I want to have babies.

409
00:19:52,066 --> 00:19:54,861
You want to have babies?!

410
00:19:54,902 --> 00:19:57,321
It's every man's right to have
babies if he wants them.

411
00:19:57,363 --> 00:19:59,198
But you can't have babies!

412
00:19:59,239 --> 00:20:00,908
Don't you oppress me.

413
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:03,744
I'm not oppressing you, Stan.
You haven't got a womb.

414
00:20:03,786 --> 00:20:08,207
Where's the fetus gonna gestate?
You gonna keep it in a box?

415
00:20:11,794 --> 00:20:13,462
Here, I've got an idea.

416
00:20:13,504 --> 00:20:16,215
Suppose you agree that he
can't actually have babies,

417
00:20:16,256 --> 00:20:19,177
not having a womb,
which is nobody's fault,
not even the Romans',

418
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:22,180
but that he can have
the right to have babies.

419
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:24,390
Good idea, Judith.

420
00:20:24,431 --> 00:20:27,351
We shall fight the oppressors
for your right to have babies,
brother--

421
00:20:27,393 --> 00:20:30,563
-Sister. Sorry.
-What's the point?

422
00:20:30,604 --> 00:20:32,606
-What?
-What's the point of fighting

423
00:20:32,648 --> 00:20:37,361
for his right to have babies
when he can't have babies?

424
00:20:37,403 --> 00:20:41,532
It is symbolic of our struggle
against oppression.

425
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:44,952
Symbolic of his struggle
against reality.

426
00:20:44,994 --> 00:20:48,330
[fanfare plays]

427
00:20:48,372 --> 00:20:52,459
[light applause]

428
00:20:52,501 --> 00:20:55,213
-[man] Get out there. Get out.
-[man #2] It's dangerous
out there.

Larks' tongues.

433
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:20,487
Otters' noses.

434
00:21:20,529 --> 00:21:21,989
Ocelots' spleens.

435
00:21:22,031 --> 00:21:24,117
-Got any nuts?
-Haven't got any nuts, sorry.

436
00:21:24,158 --> 00:21:25,743
I've got wrens' livers,
badgers' spleens--

437
00:21:25,785 --> 00:21:27,703
No, no, no.

438
00:21:27,745 --> 00:21:30,414
-Otters' noses?
-I don't want any
of that Roman rubbish.

439
00:21:30,456 --> 00:21:33,500
-Why don't you sell proper food?
-Proper food?

440
00:21:33,542 --> 00:21:36,336
Yeah, not those rich
imperialist tidbits.

441
00:21:36,378 --> 00:21:39,590
Well, don't blame me.
I didn't ask to sell this stuff.

442
00:21:39,632 --> 00:21:41,634
All right, bag of
otters' noses, then.

443
00:21:41,675 --> 00:21:43,552
-Make it two.
-Two.

444
00:21:43,594 --> 00:21:44,887
Thanks, Reg.

445
00:21:44,929 --> 00:21:46,264
Are you the
Judean People's Front?

446
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:48,766
-Fuck off!
-What?

447
00:21:48,808 --> 00:21:51,477
[scoffs] Judean People's Front.

448
00:21:51,518 --> 00:21:53,813
We're
The People's Front of Judea.

449
00:21:53,854 --> 00:21:58,151
-Judean People's Front, God!
-Wankers.

450
00:22:00,153 --> 00:22:01,862
Can I join your group?

451
00:22:01,904 --> 00:22:03,489
No, piss off.

452
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:05,491
I didn't want to sell
this stuff. It's only a job.

453
00:22:05,532 --> 00:22:07,576
I hate the Romans
as much as anybody.

454
00:22:07,618 --> 00:22:08,786
Shh, shh, shh!

455
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:11,289
Are you sure?

456
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:14,292
Oh, dead sure.
I hate the Romans already.

457
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:17,837
Listen, if you wanted
to join the PFJ,

458
00:22:17,878 --> 00:22:20,798
you'd have to
really hate the Romans.

459
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:22,300
I do.

460
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:24,677
Oh, yeah, how much?

461
00:22:24,718 --> 00:22:26,344
A lot.

462
00:22:28,346 --> 00:22:30,224
Right, you're in.

463
00:22:30,266 --> 00:22:33,311
Listen, the only people
we hate more than the Romans

464
00:22:33,351 --> 00:22:35,313
are the fuckin'
Judean People's Front.

465
00:22:35,353 --> 00:22:36,772
-Yeah!
-Splitters.

466
00:22:36,814 --> 00:22:38,356
And the Judean
Popular People's Front.

467
00:22:38,398 --> 00:22:40,276
-Oh, yeah.
-Splitters.

468
00:22:40,318 --> 00:22:42,153
And the People's Front of Judea.

469
00:22:42,195 --> 00:22:43,696
-[Francis and Judith] Splitters.
-What?

470
00:22:43,737 --> 00:22:45,698
The People's Front of Judea.
Splitters.

471
00:22:45,739 --> 00:22:48,826
We're the
People's Front of Judea!

472
00:22:48,868 --> 00:22:50,077
Oh...

473
00:22:50,119 --> 00:22:51,578
I thought we were
the Popular Front.

474
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:53,622
People's Front!

475
00:22:53,664 --> 00:22:56,416
Whatever happened
to the Popular Front, Reg?

476
00:22:56,458 --> 00:22:58,418
He's over there.

477
00:23:00,796 --> 00:23:02,131
[all] Splitter!

-Absolutely dreadful.
-Humph!

485
00:23:29,283 --> 00:23:30,826
Yes, brother!

00:23:30,868 --> 00:23:32,203
Ha-ha!

487
00:23:32,245 --> 00:23:33,704
What's your name?

488
00:23:33,746 --> 00:23:37,083
Brian. Brian Cohen.

489
00:23:37,124 --> 00:23:40,002
We may have a little job
for you, Brian.

What's this then?
<i>"Romanes eunt domus"?</i>

00:24:39,145 --> 00:24:42,231
"People called Romanes,
they go the house"?

494
00:24:42,273 --> 00:24:45,359
It says, "Romans go home."

495
00:24:45,401 --> 00:24:46,652
-No, it doesn't.
-[whimpers]

496
00:24:46,693 --> 00:24:48,695
What's Latin for "Roman"?

-Come on.
-[shrieks]<i> Romanus?</i>

-Goes like?
<i>-Anus?</i>

499
00:24:52,241 --> 00:24:53,533
Vocative plural of<i> anus</i> is?

[whimpering]<i> Ani?</i>

00:24:55,077 --> 00:24:57,955
<i>Romani.</i>

00:24:57,997 --> 00:24:59,706
<i>"Eunt"?</i> What is<i> eunt?</i>

503
00:24:59,748 --> 00:25:00,874
Go.

504
00:25:00,916 --> 00:25:02,376
Conjugate the verb
"to go".

<i>imus, itis, eunt.</i>

-So<i> eunt</i> is?
-[whimpering]

507
00:25:08,548 --> 00:25:11,218
Third person plural, present
indicative. "They go."

508
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:15,764
But "Romans go home"
is an order,
so you must use the...?

-Which is?

<i>-Ite.</i>

<i>Domus?</i> Nominative?

514
00:25:29,527 --> 00:25:33,699
"Go home." This is motion
towards, isn't it, boy?

515
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:35,159
Dative! Ahh!

516
00:25:35,201 --> 00:25:36,576
Not dative,
not the dative, sir!

517
00:25:36,618 --> 00:25:37,995
[shrieking]

518
00:25:38,037 --> 00:25:39,537
The accusative! Accusative!

519
00:25:39,579 --> 00:25:41,165
<i>Domum,</i> sir.<i> Ad domum.</i>

520
00:25:41,207 --> 00:25:43,376
Except that<i> domus</i> takes the...?

521
00:25:43,417 --> 00:25:44,960
-The locative, sir.
-Which is?!

522
00:25:45,002 --> 00:25:46,753
<i>-Domum!</i>
<i>-Domum.</i>

523
00:25:46,795 --> 00:25:50,341
-[panting]
<i>-Um.</i>

524
00:25:50,383 --> 00:25:52,051
-Understand?
-Yes, sir.

525
00:25:52,092 --> 00:25:53,969
-Now, write that 100 times.
-Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

526
00:25:54,011 --> 00:25:55,721
-Hail Caesar, sir.
-Hail Cesar.

527
00:25:55,762 --> 00:25:57,764
If it's not done by sunrise,
I'll cut your balls off.

528
00:25:57,806 --> 00:25:59,266
Oh, thank you, sir.
Thank you, sir.

529
00:25:59,308 --> 00:26:01,727
Hail Caesar and
everything, sir.

530
00:26:09,068 --> 00:26:12,279
-[cheerful music]
-[birds singing]

531
00:26:21,539 --> 00:26:23,790
[panting]

532
00:26:23,832 --> 00:26:25,251
Finished.

533
00:26:26,626 --> 00:26:28,045
Right.

534
00:26:28,087 --> 00:26:30,839
Now, don't do it again.

535
00:26:42,642 --> 00:26:45,603
[dramatic music]

536
00:26:50,025 --> 00:26:51,651
[music continues]

537
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:55,864
Hey! Bloody Romans.

538
00:27:03,372 --> 00:27:05,541
[music continues]

539
00:27:30,316 --> 00:27:33,527
[Francis] We get in through
the underground
heating-system here,

540
00:27:33,569 --> 00:27:35,946
up through into the main
audience chamber here

541
00:27:35,988 --> 00:27:39,450
and Pilate's wife's
bedroom is here.

542
00:27:39,492 --> 00:27:40,951
Having grabbed his wife,

543
00:27:40,993 --> 00:27:42,953
we inform Pilate
that she is in our custody,

544
00:27:42,995 --> 00:27:45,539
and forthwith issue
our demands.

545
00:27:45,581 --> 00:27:48,501
-Any questions?
-What exactly are the demands?

546
00:27:48,542 --> 00:27:50,544
We're giving Pilate
two days to dismantle

547
00:27:50,586 --> 00:27:53,088
the entire apparatus of
the Roman imperialist state

548
00:27:53,130 --> 00:27:55,715
and if he doesn't agree
immediately, we execute her.

549
00:27:55,757 --> 00:27:57,009
Cut her head off?

550
00:27:57,050 --> 00:27:58,427
Cut all her bits off.

551
00:27:58,469 --> 00:28:00,346
Send them back on the hour,
every hour.

552
00:28:00,387 --> 00:28:01,847
Show them we're not
to be trifled with.

553
00:28:01,888 --> 00:28:03,723
And, of course,
we point out

554
00:28:03,765 --> 00:28:07,019
that they bear
full responsibility
when we chop her up

555
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:10,397
and that we shall not
submit to blackmail.

556
00:28:10,439 --> 00:28:12,732
[all] No blackmail!

557
00:28:12,774 --> 00:28:15,110
They've bled us white,
the bastards.

558
00:28:15,152 --> 00:28:16,529
They've taken
everything we had.

559
00:28:16,570 --> 00:28:18,155
And not just from us!

560
00:28:18,197 --> 00:28:20,115
From our fathers,
and from our fathers' fathers.

561
00:28:20,157 --> 00:28:21,992
And from our fathers'
fathers' fathers.

562
00:28:22,034 --> 00:28:24,786
-Yeah.
-And from our fathers'
fathers' fathers' fathers.

563
00:28:24,828 --> 00:28:26,746
Yeah, all right, Stan,
don't labor the point.

564
00:28:26,788 --> 00:28:29,833
And what have they ever
given us in return?

565
00:28:32,127 --> 00:28:34,087
The aqueduct?

566
00:28:34,129 --> 00:28:35,881
-What?
-The aqueduct.

567
00:28:35,922 --> 00:28:39,051
Oh, yeah, yeah, they did
give us that. That's true, yeah.

568
00:28:39,092 --> 00:28:41,595
And the sanitation.

569
00:28:41,637 --> 00:28:43,222
Oh, yeah,
the sanitation, Reg.

570
00:28:43,263 --> 00:28:45,224
Remember what the city
used to be like.

571
00:28:45,265 --> 00:28:47,518
Yeah, all right, I'll grant you
the aqueduct and sanitation

572
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:49,019
are two things
the Romans have done.

573
00:28:49,061 --> 00:28:50,479
And the roads.

574
00:28:50,521 --> 00:28:52,064
Well, yeah,
obviously the roads.

575
00:28:52,105 --> 00:28:54,149
I mean, the roads go
without saying, don't they?

576
00:28:54,191 --> 00:28:56,610
But apart from the sanitation,
the aqueduct and the roads--

577
00:28:56,652 --> 00:28:59,655
-[man] Irrigation.
-Medicine.

578
00:28:59,697 --> 00:29:00,906
Education.

579
00:29:00,947 --> 00:29:02,157
Yeah, yeah,
all right, fair enough.

580
00:29:02,199 --> 00:29:03,325
And the wine.

581
00:29:03,367 --> 00:29:05,285
[all murmur in agreement]

582
00:29:05,327 --> 00:29:08,539
Yeah! Yeah, that's something
we'd really miss, Reg,
if the Romans left.

583
00:29:08,581 --> 00:29:10,207
[man #2] Public baths.

584
00:29:10,249 --> 00:29:12,334
And it's safe to walk
in the streets at night now,
Reg.

585
00:29:12,376 --> 00:29:14,294
Yeah, they certainly know
how to keep order.

586
00:29:14,336 --> 00:29:16,004
Let's face it,
they're the only ones who could
in a place like this.

587
00:29:16,046 --> 00:29:18,632
[all laugh]

588
00:29:18,674 --> 00:29:21,385
All right, but apart from
the sanitation, the medicine,

589
00:29:21,427 --> 00:29:23,345
education, wine, public order,

590
00:29:23,387 --> 00:29:27,015
irrigation, roads,
the fresh-water system
and public health,

591
00:29:27,057 --> 00:29:30,644
what have the Romans
ever done for us?

592
00:29:30,686 --> 00:29:31,937
Brought peace?

593
00:29:31,978 --> 00:29:33,439
Oh, peace!

594
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:34,940
Shut up!

595
00:29:34,981 --> 00:29:36,316
[loud knocking]

596
00:29:36,358 --> 00:29:38,360
[dramatic music]

597
00:29:43,699 --> 00:29:45,743
[knocking continues]

598
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:48,370
I'm a poor man.
My sight is poor.

599
00:29:48,412 --> 00:29:50,623
My legs are old and bent.

600
00:29:50,664 --> 00:29:52,416
It's all right, Matthias.

601
00:29:52,458 --> 00:29:54,752
It's all clear.

602
00:30:02,342 --> 00:30:04,303
Well, where's Reg?

603
00:30:05,471 --> 00:30:06,805
Oh, Reg.

604
00:30:06,846 --> 00:30:09,224
Reg, it's Judith.

605
00:30:09,266 --> 00:30:10,225
What went wrong?

606
00:30:10,267 --> 00:30:12,436
The first blow has been struck.

607
00:30:12,478 --> 00:30:15,855
-Did he finish the slogan?
-A hundred times.

608
00:30:15,897 --> 00:30:19,985
In letters ten-foot high,
all the way around the palace.

609
00:30:20,026 --> 00:30:22,404
Oh, great.

610
00:30:22,446 --> 00:30:23,739
Great!

611
00:30:23,781 --> 00:30:25,824
We... we need doers
in our movement, Brian,

612
00:30:25,865 --> 00:30:28,034
but before you join us,
know this,

613
00:30:28,076 --> 00:30:30,496
there is not one of us here who
would not gladly suffer death

614
00:30:30,537 --> 00:30:32,790
to rid this country of
the Romans once and for all.

615
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:35,375
[man] Uh, well, one.

616
00:30:35,417 --> 00:30:36,960
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, there's one.

617
00:30:37,002 --> 00:30:39,212
But otherwise, we're solid.
Are you with us?

618
00:30:39,254 --> 00:30:42,215
Yes.

619
00:30:42,257 --> 00:30:46,470
From now on, you shall
be called, "Brian,
that is called Brian."

620
00:30:46,512 --> 00:30:49,598
Tell him about the raid
on Pilate's palace, Francis.

621
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:51,433
Right. This is the plan...

622
00:30:51,475 --> 00:30:53,268
[dramatic music]

623
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:55,521
[Francis]<i> Now, this is the</i>
<i>palace in Caesar's Square.</i>

624
00:30:55,562 --> 00:30:58,398
<i>Our commando unit will approach</i>

<i>under cover of night,</i>

625
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:01,568

-Aren't you gonna come with us?
-Solidarity, brother.

632
00:31:20,504 --> 00:31:23,882
Oh, yes. Solidarity, Reg.

What's your group
doing here?

652
00:33:19,790 --> 00:33:21,249
We're gonna
kidnap Pilate's wife.

Take her back.

-So are we.
-What?

655
00:33:24,419 --> 00:33:25,754
That's our plan.

656
00:33:25,796 --> 00:33:28,173
-We were here first.
-What do you mean?

657
00:33:28,214 --> 00:33:30,258
-We thought of it first.
-Oh, yeah?

658
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:31,426
Yes, a couple
of years ago.

660
00:33:32,636 --> 00:33:34,012
-[man] We did?
-Okay, come on.

661
00:33:34,053 --> 00:33:35,514
You got all your
demands worked out?

662
00:33:35,555 --> 00:33:37,307
-Of course we have.
-What are they?

663
00:33:37,349 --> 00:33:40,352
-Well, I'm not telling you.
-Pull the other one.

664
00:33:40,393 --> 00:33:43,062
That's not the point.
We thought of it before you.

665
00:33:43,104 --> 00:33:44,397
-Did not.
-We did.

666
00:33:44,439 --> 00:33:45,983
-You didn't.
-We bloody did!

667
00:33:46,024 --> 00:33:47,442
[all argue, shushing]

668
00:33:47,484 --> 00:33:48,777
You bastards, we've been
planning this for months.

669
00:33:48,819 --> 00:33:50,737
Well, tough titty for you,
fish-face.

670
00:33:50,779 --> 00:33:52,990
-All right.
-Why you sly...

671
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:55,993
Brothers! Brothers! We should
be struggling together!

672
00:33:56,034 --> 00:33:58,286
We are.

673
00:33:58,328 --> 00:33:59,997
We mustn't fight each other!

674
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:03,082
Surely, we should be united
against the common enemy!

00:34:03,124 --> 00:34:05,544
[all] The Judean
People's Front?!

676

No, no, the Romans!

00:34:08,505 --> 00:34:10,465
-[all] Oh, yeah.
-Yes.

678
00:34:10,507 --> 00:34:12,258
-[Francis] Yeah, he's right.
-[man #1] Look out!

679
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:13,593
[man #2] Careful.

-Right! Where were we?
-You were gonna punch me.

681
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:22,895
Oh, yeah!

00:35:08,982 --> 00:35:11,401
[music continues]

687
00:35:16,782 --> 00:35:20,159
-[indistinct groans and shouts]
-[whip cracking]

688
00:35:40,513 --> 00:35:42,390
[laughs, then spits]

689
00:35:42,432 --> 00:35:43,767
[groaning]

690
00:35:43,809 --> 00:35:47,104
[continues laughing,
then coughs]

691
00:35:49,314 --> 00:35:53,192
-[man] You lucky bastard.
-Who's that?

692
00:35:53,234 --> 00:35:56,696
-You lucky, lucky bastard.
-What?

693
00:35:56,738 --> 00:35:59,198
Proper little jailer's pet,
aren't we?

694
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:00,533
What do you mean?

695
00:36:00,575 --> 00:36:02,828
You must have slipped him
a few shekels, eh?

696
00:36:02,869 --> 00:36:05,705
Slipped him a few shekels?
You saw him spit in my face!

697
00:36:05,747 --> 00:36:10,043
Oh! What wouldn't I give
to be spat at in the face?

698
00:36:10,085 --> 00:36:11,837
I sometimes
hang awake at night,

699
00:36:11,878 --> 00:36:14,965
dreaming of being
spat at in the face.

700
00:36:15,007 --> 00:36:17,843
Well, it's not exactly friendly.
They had me in manacles!

701
00:36:17,884 --> 00:36:18,677
Manacles!

702
00:36:18,718 --> 00:36:21,054
[moans]

703
00:36:21,096 --> 00:36:26,351
My idea of heaven is to be
allowed to be put in manacles
just for a few hours.

704
00:36:26,392 --> 00:36:30,522
They must think the sun shines
out of your ass, sonny.

705
00:36:30,563 --> 00:36:32,732
Oh, lay off me,
I've had a hard time!

706
00:36:32,774 --> 00:36:34,317
You've had a hard time?

707
00:36:34,359 --> 00:36:35,861
I've been here five years,

708
00:36:35,902 --> 00:36:37,904
they only hung me
the right way up yesterday!

709
00:36:37,946 --> 00:36:39,405
So don't you come around--

710
00:36:39,447 --> 00:36:40,866
All right, all right.

711
00:36:40,907 --> 00:36:45,286
They must think
you're Lord God almighty.

712
00:36:45,328 --> 00:36:47,580
What will they do to me?

713
00:36:47,622 --> 00:36:49,541
Oh, you'll probably get away
with crucifixion.

714
00:36:49,582 --> 00:36:52,585
-Crucifixion?!
-Yeah. First offence.

715
00:36:52,627 --> 00:36:54,796
Get away with crucifixion?!
It's--

716
00:36:54,838 --> 00:36:56,756
Best thing
the Romans ever did for us.

717
00:36:56,798 --> 00:36:58,341
-What?!
-Oh, yeah.

718
00:36:58,383 --> 00:36:59,759
If we didn't have crucifixion,

719
00:36:59,801 --> 00:37:01,803
this country would be in
a right bloody mess.

720
00:37:01,845 --> 00:37:04,139
-Guard!
-Nail them up, I say!

721
00:37:04,181 --> 00:37:07,392
-Guard!
-Nail some sense into them!

722
00:37:07,433 --> 00:37:09,186
What do you want?

723
00:37:09,227 --> 00:37:10,812
I want you to move me
to another cell.

724
00:37:10,854 --> 00:37:12,856
-Ha! [spits]
-Ahh!

725
00:37:12,898 --> 00:37:16,275
Oh, look at that!
Bloody favoritism!

726
00:37:16,317 --> 00:37:19,612
-Shut up, you.
-Sorry.

727
00:37:21,322 --> 00:37:23,491
-[coughing]
-Now, take my case.

728
00:37:23,533 --> 00:37:25,410
They hung me up here
five years ago.

729
00:37:25,451 --> 00:37:27,579
Every night they take me down
for 20 minutes

730
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:28,705
then they hang me up again.

731
00:37:28,747 --> 00:37:30,623
Which I regard as very fair

732
00:37:30,665 --> 00:37:32,250
in view of what I've done.

733
00:37:32,291 --> 00:37:36,880
And if nothing else, it's taught
me to respect the Romans

734
00:37:36,922 --> 00:37:40,550
and it's taught me that you'll
never get anywhere in this life

735
00:37:40,592 --> 00:37:43,595
unless you are prepared to do
a fair day's work

736
00:37:43,636 --> 00:37:46,305
-for a fair day's--
-Oh, shut up!

737
00:37:49,267 --> 00:37:51,603
-Pilate wants to see you!
-Me?

738
00:37:51,644 --> 00:37:53,021
Come on!

739
00:37:53,063 --> 00:37:54,856
[Brian] Pilate?
What does he want to see me for?

740
00:37:54,898 --> 00:37:57,275
I think he wants to know which
way you want to be crucified.

741
00:37:57,316 --> 00:37:59,861
Oh! [exaggerated laugh]

742
00:37:59,903 --> 00:38:02,197
Nice one, centurion.
Like it, like it.

743
00:38:02,239 --> 00:38:05,075
-Shut up!
-Right. Right.

744
00:38:06,201 --> 00:38:08,120
Terrific race, the Romans.

745
00:38:08,161 --> 00:38:10,080
Terrific.

746
00:38:10,122 --> 00:38:13,541
[fanfare plays]

747
00:38:20,799 --> 00:38:22,259
Looks like a nice living area.

748
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:25,553
-[disappointed] Oh.
-[footsteps approaching]

749
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:29,224
-Hail Caesar.
-Hail.

750
00:38:29,266 --> 00:38:30,391
Only one survivor, sir.

751
00:38:30,433 --> 00:38:33,394
Ah. Throw him
to the floor.

752
00:38:33,436 --> 00:38:36,397
-What, sir?
-Throw him to the floor.

753
00:38:36,439 --> 00:38:37,816
Oh.

754
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:40,026
[groans]

755
00:38:40,068 --> 00:38:41,236
Humph.

756
00:38:41,278 --> 00:38:44,739
Now, what is
your name, Jew?

757
00:38:44,781 --> 00:38:47,742
-Brian, sir.
-[speech impediment] Brian, eh?

758
00:38:47,784 --> 00:38:49,494
No, no, Brian.

759
00:38:49,535 --> 00:38:51,913
-Ow!
-[Pilate chuckles]

760
00:38:51,955 --> 00:38:55,125
The little rascal has spirit.

761
00:38:55,167 --> 00:38:57,294
-Has what, sir?
-Spirit.

762
00:38:57,335 --> 00:38:59,420
Yes, he did, sir.

763
00:38:59,462 --> 00:39:01,464
No, no, spirit.

764
00:39:01,506 --> 00:39:04,342
Bravado,
a touch of derring-do.

765
00:39:04,383 --> 00:39:07,012
Oh, uh, about 11, sir.

766
00:39:09,139 --> 00:39:11,390
So...

767
00:39:11,432 --> 00:39:14,060
-You dare to raid us?
-To what, sir?

768
00:39:14,102 --> 00:39:16,980
Strike him, centurion,
very roughly.

769
00:39:17,022 --> 00:39:19,440
-Ahh!
-Oh, and, uh...

770
00:39:19,482 --> 00:39:21,026
throw him to the floor, sir?

771
00:39:21,067 --> 00:39:23,028
-What?
-Throw him to the floor again,
sir?

772
00:39:23,069 --> 00:39:25,530
Oh, yes.
Throw him to the floor, please.

773
00:39:26,698 --> 00:39:27,824
Ahh!

774
00:39:27,866 --> 00:39:31,369
Now, Jewish
rapscallion...

775
00:39:31,410 --> 00:39:33,579
I'm not Jewish,
I'm a Roman.

776
00:39:33,621 --> 00:39:36,499
-A Roman?
-No, no, Roman.

777
00:39:36,541 --> 00:39:38,417
Ahh!

778
00:39:38,459 --> 00:39:39,919
So...

779
00:39:39,961 --> 00:39:42,130
your father
was a Roman?

780
00:39:42,172 --> 00:39:43,589
Who was he?

781
00:39:43,631 --> 00:39:47,719
He was a centurion
in the Jerusalem garrison, sir.

782
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:49,179
Really?

783
00:39:49,221 --> 00:39:52,431
-What was his name?
-Naughtius Maximus.

784
00:39:52,473 --> 00:39:54,392
[laughs heartily]

785
00:39:56,644 --> 00:39:59,856
Centurion, do you have anyone
of that name in the garrison?

786
00:40:00,982 --> 00:40:02,984
Well, no, sir.

787
00:40:03,026 --> 00:40:06,154
Well, you sound very sure.
Have you checked?

788
00:40:06,196 --> 00:40:07,572
Well, no, sir, um...

789
00:40:07,613 --> 00:40:10,200
I think it's a joke, sir.

790
00:40:10,242 --> 00:40:12,035
Like "Sillius Soddus"

791
00:40:12,077 --> 00:40:13,995
or "Biggus Dickus," sir.

792
00:40:14,037 --> 00:40:15,580
[men stifle laughter]

793
00:40:15,621 --> 00:40:19,625
What's so funny
about Biggus Dickus?

794
00:40:20,793 --> 00:40:24,047
Well, it's a joke name, sir.

795
00:40:24,089 --> 00:40:27,133
I have a very great friend
in Rome called Biggus Dickus.

796
00:40:27,175 --> 00:40:28,426
[guard stifles laugh]

797
00:40:30,095 --> 00:40:32,847
Silence!
What is all this insolence?

798
00:40:32,889 --> 00:40:36,601
You will find yourself in
gladiator school very quickly

799
00:40:36,642 --> 00:40:38,519
with rotten behavior like that.

800
00:40:38,561 --> 00:40:40,188
Can I go now, sir?

801
00:40:40,230 --> 00:40:42,523
Ahh!

802
00:40:42,565 --> 00:40:44,483
Wait till Biggus Dickus
hears of this.

803
00:40:44,525 --> 00:40:46,361
-[stifles laugh]
-Right!

804
00:40:46,403 --> 00:40:48,529
-Take him away!
-Oh, sir, he--

805
00:40:48,571 --> 00:40:51,783
No, no, I want him fighting
rabid wild animals
within a week!

806
00:40:51,824 --> 00:40:53,492
Yes, sir. Come on, you.

807
00:40:53,534 --> 00:40:57,580
[laughing]

808
00:40:57,622 --> 00:41:03,669
I will not have my friends
ridiculed by the common
soldiery!

809
00:41:05,171 --> 00:41:08,341
Anybody else
feel like a little...

810
00:41:08,383 --> 00:41:09,717
giggle

811
00:41:09,759 --> 00:41:13,846
when I mention my friend,

812
00:41:13,888 --> 00:41:15,807
Biggus

813
00:41:17,058 --> 00:41:19,436
-Dickus?
-[soldiers snicker]

814
00:41:22,314 --> 00:41:23,982
And what about you?

815
00:41:24,023 --> 00:41:27,068
Do you find it... risible

816
00:41:29,362 --> 00:41:32,573
when I say the name

817
00:41:32,615 --> 00:41:34,284
-Biggus
-[squeaks]

818
00:41:36,035 --> 00:41:37,162
Dickus?

819
00:41:37,203 --> 00:41:39,122
[snickers]

820
00:41:43,251 --> 00:41:45,544
[snickering continues]

821
00:41:56,764 --> 00:41:59,184
He has a wife, you know.

822
00:42:00,435 --> 00:42:02,520
You know what she's called?

823
00:42:05,648 --> 00:42:07,775
She's called...

824
00:42:07,817 --> 00:42:09,902
Incontinentia.

825
00:42:11,946 --> 00:42:13,614
-Incontinentia Buttocks.
-[uncontrollable laughter]

826
00:42:13,656 --> 00:42:15,825
Shut up!
What is all this?

827
00:42:15,867 --> 00:42:20,246
-[soldiers cackling]
-I've had enough of this rowdy,
rebel, sniggering behavior!

828
00:42:20,288 --> 00:42:23,458
Silence! You call yourselves
centurion guards?

829
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:25,543
Seize him! Seize him!

830
00:42:25,584 --> 00:42:27,462
Blow your noses
and seize him!

831
00:42:27,504 --> 00:42:29,381
[dramatic music]

832
00:42:40,599 --> 00:42:43,311
Hmm? Oh.

833
00:42:49,484 --> 00:42:51,736
[whistling]

834
00:43:04,707 --> 00:43:07,419
Ahh!

00:44:25,079 --> 00:44:27,790
You lucky bastard.

842
00:44:32,253 --> 00:44:34,046
[dramatic music resumes]

843
00:44:43,473 --> 00:44:46,976
And the beast's head
shall be huge and black

844
00:44:47,018 --> 00:44:49,228
and the eyes,
they're of red,

845
00:44:49,270 --> 00:44:51,523
with the blood
of living creatures!

846
00:44:51,564 --> 00:44:55,568
And the whore of Babylon
shall ride forth

847
00:44:55,610 --> 00:44:57,736
on a three-headed serpent

848
00:44:57,778 --> 00:45:02,659
and throughout the land shall
be a great rubbing of parts.

849
00:45:02,699 --> 00:45:07,372
And the demon shall bear
a nine-bladed sword!

850
00:45:07,413 --> 00:45:12,001
Nine-bladed! Not two
or five or seven, but nine!

851
00:45:12,043 --> 00:45:14,629
Which he will wield
on all wretched sinners.

852
00:45:14,671 --> 00:45:16,797
Sinners just like you,
sir, there.

853
00:45:16,839 --> 00:45:18,841
And the horns
shall be on the head...

854
00:45:18,883 --> 00:45:21,177
Through Hebediah,
his servant,

855
00:45:21,219 --> 00:45:26,224
there shall in that time
be rumors of things going astray

856
00:45:26,265 --> 00:45:30,811
and there shall be
a great confusion as to
where things really are.

857
00:45:30,853 --> 00:45:35,274
And nobody will really know
where lieth those little things

858
00:45:35,316 --> 00:45:39,778
with the sort of raffia-work
base, that has an attachment.

859
00:45:39,820 --> 00:45:45,410
At this time, a friend shall
lose his friend's hammer

860
00:45:45,451 --> 00:45:48,329
and the young shall not
know where lieth

861
00:45:48,371 --> 00:45:50,498
the things possessed
by their fathers

862
00:45:50,540 --> 00:45:54,586
that their fathers put there
only just the night before,
about 8:00.

863
00:45:54,627 --> 00:45:57,547
Yea, it is written
in the Book of Cyril

864
00:45:57,589 --> 00:45:59,840
that in that time
shall the turds...

865
00:45:59,882 --> 00:46:01,884
[indistinct chattering]

866
00:46:10,101 --> 00:46:12,103
-How much? Quickly.
-What?

867
00:46:12,144 --> 00:46:13,229
It's for the wife.

868
00:46:13,271 --> 00:46:15,940
Oh. Uh... twenty shekels.

869
00:46:15,981 --> 00:46:17,442
-Right.
-What?

870
00:46:17,483 --> 00:46:19,527
-There you are.
-Wait a minute.

871
00:46:19,569 --> 00:46:21,613
-What?
-Well, we're supposed to haggle.

872
00:46:21,654 --> 00:46:23,864
-No, no, no. I've got to--
-What do you mean,
"No, no, no"?

873
00:46:23,906 --> 00:46:25,450
-I haven't got time--
-Give it back then.

874
00:46:25,491 --> 00:46:27,201
-No, no, no, I just paid you.
-Burt.

875
00:46:27,243 --> 00:46:29,370
-Yeah?
-This bloke won't haggle.

876
00:46:29,412 --> 00:46:32,498
-Won't haggle?!
-All right, do we have to?

877
00:46:32,540 --> 00:46:35,418
-Now, look, I want 20 for that.
-I just gave you 20.

878
00:46:35,460 --> 00:46:37,253
Now, are you telling me
that's not worth 20 shekels?

879
00:46:37,295 --> 00:46:38,755
-No.
-Look at it.

880
00:46:38,795 --> 00:46:40,673
Feel the quality,
that's none of your goat.

881
00:46:40,715 --> 00:46:42,174
All right,
I'll give you 19 then.

882
00:46:42,216 --> 00:46:43,842
No, no, no.
Come on, do it properly.

883
00:46:43,884 --> 00:46:46,262
-What?
-Haggle properly,
this isn't worth 19.

884
00:46:46,304 --> 00:46:47,722
Well, you just said
it was worth 20.

885
00:46:47,764 --> 00:46:49,307
Oh, dear, oh, dear.

886
00:46:49,348 --> 00:46:51,684
-Come on, haggle.
-All right, I'll give you ten.

887
00:46:51,726 --> 00:46:55,062
That's more like it. Ten?
Are you trying to insult me?

888
00:46:55,104 --> 00:46:58,190
Me, with a poor,
dying grandmother? Ten?

889
00:46:58,232 --> 00:47:00,817
-All right, I'll give you 11.
-Now you're getting it, 11?!

890
00:47:00,859 --> 00:47:03,028
Did I hear you right?
Eleven?

891
00:47:03,070 --> 00:47:05,364
This cost me 12,
you want to ruin me?

892
00:47:05,406 --> 00:47:07,908
-Seventeen?
-No, no, no, no, "17"!

893
00:47:07,950 --> 00:47:10,745
-Eighteen?
-No, no, you go to 14 now.

894
00:47:10,787 --> 00:47:13,748
-All right, I'll give you 14.
-Fourteen!? Are you joking?

895
00:47:13,790 --> 00:47:15,832
-That's what you told me to say!
-Oh, dear.

896
00:47:15,874 --> 00:47:18,252
Tell me what to say, please!

897
00:47:18,294 --> 00:47:20,463
-Offer me 14.
-I'll give you 14.

898
00:47:20,505 --> 00:47:23,299
-He's offering me 14 for this!
-Fifteen!

899
00:47:23,341 --> 00:47:26,885
Seventeen. My last word,
I won't take a penny less,
or strike me dead.

900
00:47:26,927 --> 00:47:28,262
-Sixteen.
-Done.

901
00:47:29,681 --> 00:47:31,182
Nice to do business with you.

902
00:47:31,223 --> 00:47:32,725
Tell you what,
I'll throw you in this as well.

903
00:47:32,767 --> 00:47:34,352
-I don't want it, but thanks.
-Burt.

904
00:47:34,393 --> 00:47:36,521
-Yeah.
-All right,
all right, all right.

905
00:47:36,562 --> 00:47:38,939
-Now, where's the 16 you owe me?
-I just gave you 20.

906
00:47:38,981 --> 00:47:40,941
Oh, yeah, that's right.
That's four I owe you then.

907
00:47:40,983 --> 00:47:42,360
No, that's all right,
that's fine.

908
00:47:42,401 --> 00:47:43,695
No, hang on.
I've got it here somewhere.

909
00:47:43,736 --> 00:47:45,279
It's all right,
that's four for the gourd.

910
00:47:45,321 --> 00:47:47,114
Four? For this gourd?

911
00:47:47,156 --> 00:47:50,034
Four!? Look at it, it's worth
ten if it's worth a shekel!

912
00:47:50,075 --> 00:47:51,994
You just gave it
to me for nothing.

913
00:47:52,036 --> 00:47:53,621
Yes, but it's worth ten.

914
00:47:53,663 --> 00:47:57,583
All right, all right.

915
00:47:57,625 --> 00:48:01,629
No, no, no, no,
it's not worth ten,
you're supposed to argue.

916
00:48:01,671 --> 00:48:04,382
"Ten for that? You must be mad!"

917
00:48:06,592 --> 00:48:09,220
Oh, well.
One born every minute.

918
00:48:10,304 --> 00:48:12,181
-Daniel.
-Daniel.

919
00:48:12,223 --> 00:48:13,683
-Job.
-Job.

920
00:48:13,725 --> 00:48:15,393
-Job.
-Joshua.

921
00:48:15,434 --> 00:48:16,811
-Joshua.
-Joshua.

922
00:48:16,853 --> 00:48:17,936
-Judges.
-Judges.

923
00:48:17,978 --> 00:48:19,772
-Judges.
-And Brian.

924
00:48:19,814 --> 00:48:22,358
-And Brian.
-And Brian.

925
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:26,278
I now propose that all seven
of these ex-brothers

926
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:29,948
be now entered in the minutes
as probationary martyrs
to the cause.

927
00:48:29,990 --> 00:48:33,703
-I second that, Reg.
-Thank you, Loretta. On the nod.

928
00:48:33,745 --> 00:48:37,749
Siblings,
let us not be down-hearted.

929
00:48:37,790 --> 00:48:42,754
One total catastrophe like this
is just the beginning!

930
00:48:42,795 --> 00:48:45,840
Their glorious deaths
shall unite us all in a--

931
00:48:45,882 --> 00:48:46,674
Look out!

932
00:48:46,716 --> 00:48:49,301
[dramatic music]]

933
00:48:59,061 --> 00:49:02,147
Hello? Matthias?

934
00:49:03,566 --> 00:49:05,902
-Reg.
-[Reg whispers] Go away.

935
00:49:07,069 --> 00:49:08,905
Reg, it's me, Brian.

936
00:49:08,945 --> 00:49:10,907
Get off. Get off, out of it.

937
00:49:10,947 --> 00:49:12,283
-Stan?
-Piss off.

938
00:49:12,324 --> 00:49:14,535
-Yeah, piss off.
-[Reg] Bugger off.

939
00:49:14,577 --> 00:49:16,120
[loud knocking]

940
00:49:16,161 --> 00:49:19,373
Oh, shit!

941
00:49:20,458 --> 00:49:22,501
Coming.

942
00:49:22,543 --> 00:49:26,881
[knocking continues]

943
00:49:26,923 --> 00:49:30,635
[man] Yea, verily at that time,
which is written
in the Book of Obadiah,

944
00:49:30,676 --> 00:49:35,222
a man shall strike his donkey
and his nephew's donkey,

945
00:49:35,264 --> 00:49:38,476
and anyone in the vicinity of
either the nephew or the donkey.

946
00:49:38,517 --> 00:49:41,978
[Matthias] My eyes are dim,
I cannot see.

947
00:49:42,020 --> 00:49:44,022
-Are you Matthias?
-Yes.

948
00:49:44,064 --> 00:49:47,151
We have reason to believe
you may be hiding one
Brian of Nazareth,

949
00:49:47,192 --> 00:49:50,822
a member of
the terrorist organization
the People's Front of Judea.

950
00:49:50,863 --> 00:49:55,493
Me? No, I'm just a poor old man,
I have no time for lawbreakers.

951
00:49:55,534 --> 00:49:57,994
My legs are grey,
my ears are nulled,

952
00:49:58,036 --> 00:50:00,790
-my eyes are old and bent--
-Quiet!

953
00:50:00,832 --> 00:50:04,293
Silly person.
Guards, search the house.

954
00:50:14,887 --> 00:50:19,391
You know the penalty
laid down by Roman law
for harboring a known criminal?

955
00:50:19,433 --> 00:50:21,393
-No.
-Crucifixion.

956
00:50:21,435 --> 00:50:22,561
Oh.

957
00:50:24,396 --> 00:50:25,731
Nasty, eh?

958
00:50:25,773 --> 00:50:27,566
It could be worse.

959
00:50:27,608 --> 00:50:30,026
What do you mean,
"could be worse"?

960
00:50:30,068 --> 00:50:32,363
Well, you could be
stabbed.

961
00:50:32,404 --> 00:50:34,532
Stabbed?
It takes a second.

962
00:50:34,573 --> 00:50:38,619
Crucifixion lasts hours.
It's a slow, horrible death.

963
00:50:38,661 --> 00:50:42,206
Well, at least it gets you
out in the open air.

964
00:50:43,290 --> 00:50:44,834
You're weird.

965
00:50:52,758 --> 00:50:56,094
No, sir,
couldn't find anything, sir.

966
00:50:56,136 --> 00:51:00,016
Well, don't worry, you've not
seen the last of us... weirdo.

967
00:51:00,056 --> 00:51:02,267
-Big nose.
-Watch it!

968
00:51:04,854 --> 00:51:07,147
Whew! That was lucky.

969
00:51:11,109 --> 00:51:12,528
I'm sorry, Reg.

970
00:51:12,570 --> 00:51:15,239
Oh, it's all right.
Siblings, he's sorry.

971
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:18,074
He's sorry he led
the Fifth legion straight to
our official headquarters.

972
00:51:18,116 --> 00:51:19,785
Well, that's all right then,
Brian.

973
00:51:19,827 --> 00:51:23,079
Sit down! Have a scone.
Make yourself at home.

974
00:51:23,121 --> 00:51:24,916
You klutz!

975
00:51:24,957 --> 00:51:28,293
You stupid, birdbrained,
flat-headed--

976
00:51:28,335 --> 00:51:30,128
[loud knocking]

977
00:51:32,965 --> 00:51:35,509
[man continues] ...with a great
juicy melon behind.

978
00:51:35,551 --> 00:51:37,177
[knocking continues]

979
00:51:37,219 --> 00:51:40,514
My legs are old and bent,
my ears are grizzled, yes?

980
00:51:40,556 --> 00:51:43,475
There's one place
we didn't look.

981
00:51:43,517 --> 00:51:45,310
-Guards!
-I'm just a poor old man,

982
00:51:45,352 --> 00:51:50,106
my sight is dim, my eyes are
poor, my nose is knackered.

983
00:51:50,148 --> 00:51:52,944
Have you ever seen
anyone crucified?

984
00:51:52,985 --> 00:51:55,780
Crucifixion's a doddle.

985
00:51:55,821 --> 00:51:57,823
Don't keep saying that.

986
00:52:02,244 --> 00:52:04,580
Found this spoon, sir.

987
00:52:04,622 --> 00:52:06,540
Well done, sergeant.

988
00:52:07,625 --> 00:52:10,669
We'll be back...
oddball.

989
00:52:13,089 --> 00:52:15,633
-[loud knocking]
-[man] Open up.

990
00:52:15,674 --> 00:52:18,260
You haven't given us
time to hide.

991
00:52:18,302 --> 00:52:20,304
Ahh!

992
00:52:20,345 --> 00:52:22,765
Whoa!

993
00:52:29,605 --> 00:52:33,442
[both shouting]

994
00:52:33,484 --> 00:52:36,695
[both preaching]

995
00:52:42,076 --> 00:52:44,870
Don't pass judgment
on other people,

996
00:52:44,912 --> 00:52:47,123
or you might get
judged yourself.

997
00:52:47,163 --> 00:52:48,624
What?

998
00:52:48,666 --> 00:52:50,626
I said, don't pass judgment
on other people

999
00:52:50,668 --> 00:52:53,169
or else you might
get judged too.

1000
00:52:53,211 --> 00:52:55,255
-Who, me?
-Yes.

1001
00:52:55,297 --> 00:52:56,757
Oh, thank you very much.

1002
00:52:56,799 --> 00:52:58,843
Well, not just you,
all of you.

1003
00:52:58,884 --> 00:53:01,261
-That's a nice gourd.
-What?

1004
00:53:01,303 --> 00:53:03,430
-How much do you want
for the gourd?
-You can have it.

1005
00:53:03,472 --> 00:53:06,058
-Have it?
-Yes. Consider the lilies.

1006
00:53:06,100 --> 00:53:08,853
-Don't you want to haggle?
-No. In the field.

1007
00:53:08,894 --> 00:53:11,147
-What's wrong with it, then?
-Nothing, take it.

1008
00:53:11,187 --> 00:53:14,358
-Consider the lilies?
-Well, the birds, then.

1009
00:53:14,399 --> 00:53:15,943
-What birds?
-Any birds.

1010
00:53:15,985 --> 00:53:19,155
-Why?
-Well, have they got jobs?

1011
00:53:19,195 --> 00:53:21,239
-Who?
-The birds.

1012
00:53:21,281 --> 00:53:22,741
Have the birds got jobs?!

1013
00:53:22,783 --> 00:53:24,493
What's the matter
with him?

1014
00:53:24,535 --> 00:53:26,286
He says the birds
are scrounging.

1015
00:53:26,328 --> 00:53:29,540
No, the point is the birds,
they do all right, don't they?

1016
00:53:29,581 --> 00:53:32,501
-Well, and good luck to them!
-Yeah, they're very pretty.

1017
00:53:32,543 --> 00:53:36,839
Okay. And you're much more
important than they are, right?

1018
00:53:36,881 --> 00:53:39,383
So, what are you worrying about?
There you are! See?

1019
00:53:39,424 --> 00:53:42,011
I'm worrying about what
you've got against birds.

1020
00:53:42,053 --> 00:53:45,347
I haven't got anything against
birds. Consider lilies--

1021
00:53:45,389 --> 00:53:47,349
He's having a go
at the flowers now.

1022
00:53:47,391 --> 00:53:49,643
-Give the flowers a chance.
-I'll give you one for it.

1023
00:53:49,685 --> 00:53:51,436
-It's yours!

01:02:13,188 --> 01:02:16,941
Lay off! This is the Messiah,
the chosen one!

1190
01:02:16,983 --> 01:02:20,362
-No, he's not.
-An unbeliever!

1191
01:02:20,404 --> 01:02:21,779
[all] An unbeliever!

1192
01:02:21,821 --> 01:02:24,616
Persecute! Kill the heretic!

1193
01:02:24,658 --> 01:02:27,035
[all] Yeah! Kill! Kill! Kill!

1194
01:02:27,077 --> 01:02:30,247
-[all chanting] Kill!
-Leave him alone!

1195
01:02:30,288 --> 01:02:33,041
Leave him alone!

1196
01:02:33,083 --> 01:02:35,335
Leave him alone.

1197
01:02:35,377 --> 01:02:38,672
Put him down. Please!

1198
01:02:39,923 --> 01:02:42,300
[romantic music]

1199
01:02:42,342 --> 01:02:43,677
Brian?

1200
01:02:43,719 --> 01:02:45,345
Judith?

1201
01:02:49,849 --> 01:02:51,560
[man imitates rooster]
Cock-a-doodle-doo!

1202
01:02:51,602 --> 01:02:53,978
[romantic music continues]

1203
01:03:31,933 --> 01:03:34,018
[all] Look, there he is!

1204
01:03:34,060 --> 01:03:37,063
The chosen one has woken!

1205
01:03:39,065 --> 01:03:40,358
-[pounding on door]
-[mother] Brian!

1206
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:41,652
[gasps]

1207
01:03:41,693 --> 01:03:43,027
Ooh! Mother!

1208
01:03:43,069 --> 01:03:46,239
-Brian!
-Hang on, Mother!

1209
01:03:47,824 --> 01:03:49,618
[door crashes open]

1210
01:03:49,660 --> 01:03:53,121
-Hello, Mother.
-Don't you "hello, Mother" me.

1211
01:03:53,163 --> 01:03:54,956
What are those people
doing out there?

1212
01:03:54,998 --> 01:03:56,416
Oh, well, I--

1213
01:03:56,458 --> 01:03:58,335
Come on! What have you
been up to, my lad?

1214
01:03:58,376 --> 01:04:00,878
I think they must have
popped by for something.

1215
01:04:00,920 --> 01:04:02,172
Popped by?!

1216
01:04:02,213 --> 01:04:04,090
Swarmed by, more like.

1217
01:04:04,132 --> 01:04:06,343
There's a multitude out there!

1218
01:04:06,384 --> 01:04:08,011
They started
following me yesterday.

1219
01:04:08,052 --> 01:04:11,306
Well, they can stop
following you right now.

1220
01:04:12,474 --> 01:04:14,810
Now stop following my son.

1221
01:04:14,851 --> 01:04:17,395
You ought to be
ashamed of yourselves.

1222
01:04:17,437 --> 01:04:21,983
[all] The Messiah! The Messiah!
Show us the Messiah!

1223
01:04:22,025 --> 01:04:25,737
-The who?
-[all] The Messiah!

1224
01:04:25,779 --> 01:04:27,405
There's no Messiah in here.

1225
01:04:27,447 --> 01:04:29,616
There's a mess all right,
but no Messiah.

1226
01:04:29,658 --> 01:04:30,950
Now go away!

1227
01:04:30,992 --> 01:04:33,161
[all chant] Brian! Brian!

1228
01:04:33,203 --> 01:04:35,747
Right, my lad,
what have you been up to?

1229
01:04:35,789 --> 01:04:37,915
-Nothing, Mum.
-Come on, out with it.

1230
01:04:37,957 --> 01:04:39,876
They think I'm the Messiah, Mum.

1231
01:04:39,917 --> 01:04:41,712
What have you been
telling them?

1232
01:04:41,753 --> 01:04:43,004
Nothing, I only--

1233
01:04:43,046 --> 01:04:44,130
You're only making it
worse for yourself.

1234
01:04:44,172 --> 01:04:45,757
Look, I can explain--

1235
01:04:45,799 --> 01:04:51,054
No, let me explain, Mrs. Cohen!
Your son is a born leader!

1236
01:04:51,095 --> 01:04:54,432
Those people out there are
following him because they
believe in him, Mrs. Cohen.

1237
01:04:54,474 --> 01:04:56,267
They believe he can
give them hope.

1238
01:04:56,309 --> 01:05:00,397
Hope of a new life,
a new world, a better future!

1239
01:05:02,524 --> 01:05:06,236
-Who's that!?
-Oh! That's Judith, Mum.

1240
01:05:06,277 --> 01:05:07,945
Judith, Mother.

1241
01:05:07,987 --> 01:05:11,408
Hmm. Ahh!

1242
01:05:11,449 --> 01:05:15,704
-Ooh...!
-[crowd chants] Show us
the Messiah!

1243
01:05:15,746 --> 01:05:18,582
Show us the Messiah!

1244
01:05:18,623 --> 01:05:21,918
Now you listen here,
he's not the Messiah!

1245
01:05:21,959 --> 01:05:25,338
He's a very naughty boy!
Now go away!

1246
01:05:25,380 --> 01:05:26,964
[all] Who are you?

1247
01:05:27,006 --> 01:05:29,551
I'm his mother, that's who.

1248
01:05:29,593 --> 01:05:33,971
[all] Behold his mother!
Behold his mother!

1249
01:05:34,013 --> 01:05:37,559
Hail to thee, mother of Brian!

1250
01:05:37,601 --> 01:05:41,354
Blessed art thou! Hosanna!

1251
01:05:41,396 --> 01:05:45,859
All things to thee,
now and always!

1252
01:05:45,901 --> 01:05:48,862
Now, don't think you can
get around me like that.

1253
01:05:48,904 --> 01:05:52,990
He's not coming out,
and that's my final word.

1254
01:05:54,075 --> 01:05:55,201
Now shove off!

1255
01:05:55,243 --> 01:05:57,704
[all] No!

1256
01:05:57,746 --> 01:05:59,873
Did you hear what I said?

1257
01:05:59,915 --> 01:06:01,332
[all] Yes!

1258
01:06:01,374 --> 01:06:04,294
Oh, I see.
It's like that, is it?

1259
01:06:04,335 --> 01:06:05,962
[all] Yes!

1260
01:06:06,003 --> 01:06:09,674
Oh, all right then, you can
see him for one minute,

1261
01:06:09,716 --> 01:06:12,594
but not one second more,
do you understand?

1262
01:06:12,636 --> 01:06:14,262
[all] Yes.

1263
01:06:14,304 --> 01:06:15,138
Promise?

1264
01:06:15,179 --> 01:06:19,100
[all] Well, all right.

1265
01:06:19,142 --> 01:06:20,852
All right, here he is then.

1266
01:06:20,894 --> 01:06:22,479
Come on, Brian,
come and talk to them.

1267
01:06:22,520 --> 01:06:25,231
-But, Mum, Judith--
-Leave that Welsh tart alone.

1268
01:06:25,273 --> 01:06:27,317
-I don't really want to, Mum.
-[crowd cheers]

1269
01:06:34,783 --> 01:06:35,784
[Brian] Good morning!

1270
01:06:35,826 --> 01:06:38,161
[all] A blessing! A blessing!

1271
01:06:38,202 --> 01:06:43,291
No, please.
Please, please, listen!

1272
01:06:43,333 --> 01:06:46,085
I've got one or two things
to say.

1273
01:06:46,127 --> 01:06:48,797
[all] Tell us!
Tell us both of them!

1274
01:06:48,839 --> 01:06:51,466
Look, you've got it all wrong!

1275
01:06:51,508 --> 01:06:53,885
You don't need to follow me.

1276
01:06:53,927 --> 01:06:57,555
You don't need to
follow anybody!

1277
01:06:57,597 --> 01:07:00,183
You've got to
think for yourselves.

1278
01:07:00,224 --> 01:07:02,727
You're all individuals!

1279
01:07:02,769 --> 01:07:06,356
[all] Yes, we're all
individuals!

1280
01:07:06,397 --> 01:07:08,358
You're all different.

1281
01:07:08,399 --> 01:07:11,528
[all] Yes, we are all different!

1282
01:07:11,569 --> 01:07:12,904
I'm not.

1283
01:07:12,946 --> 01:07:14,447
[crowd shushing]

1284
01:07:14,489 --> 01:07:18,075
You've all got to work it out
for yourselves!

1285
01:07:18,117 --> 01:07:22,413
[all] Yes, we've got to work it
out for ourselves!

1286
01:07:22,455 --> 01:07:24,791
Exactly!

1287
01:07:24,833 --> 01:07:26,626
[all] Tell us more!

1288
01:07:26,668 --> 01:07:31,172
No, that's the point! Don't let
anyone tell you what to do!

1289
01:07:31,214 --> 01:07:34,676
-Otherwise-- Oh, no!
-That's enough! That's enough.

1290
01:07:34,718 --> 01:07:36,636
[crowd boos]

1291
01:07:36,678 --> 01:07:39,222
[all] That wasn't a minute.

1292
01:07:40,390 --> 01:07:42,308
Oh, yes, it was.

1293
01:07:42,350 --> 01:07:44,811
[all] Oh, no, it wasn't!

1294
01:07:44,853 --> 01:07:47,731
Now stop that and go away.

1295
01:07:47,772 --> 01:07:50,066
-Excuse me?
-Yes?

1296
01:07:50,107 --> 01:07:52,360
Are you a virgin?

1297
01:07:52,402 --> 01:07:54,404
I beg your pardon?

1298
01:07:54,445 --> 01:07:58,909
Well, if it's not a personal
question, are you a virgin?

1299
01:07:58,950 --> 01:08:01,578
"If it's not a
personal question"?!

1300
01:08:01,619 --> 01:08:04,288
How much more
personal can you get?

1301
01:08:04,330 --> 01:08:06,457
Now piss off.

1302
01:08:07,876 --> 01:08:10,336
-She is.
-Must be. Definitely.

1303
01:08:10,378 --> 01:08:13,214
[all murmur in agreement]

1304
01:08:13,256 --> 01:08:14,716
[chattering]

1305
01:08:14,758 --> 01:08:17,510
-[all gasp]
-Morning, Savior!

1306
01:08:17,552 --> 01:08:20,096
[all clamoring]

1307
01:08:27,186 --> 01:08:29,397
Lay your hands on me! Quick!

1308
01:08:29,439 --> 01:08:32,901
[man] Now, don't jostle
the chosen one! Please!

1309
01:08:32,943 --> 01:08:35,946
Don't push that baby
in the Savior's face!

1310
01:08:35,987 --> 01:08:37,781
He'll touch it later!

1311
01:08:37,822 --> 01:08:41,325
I say, could he see my wife?
She has a headache.

1312
01:08:41,367 --> 01:08:43,036
You'll have to wait,
I'm afraid!

1313
01:08:43,078 --> 01:08:45,246
She's very bad, and we've got
a luncheon appointment.

1314
01:08:45,288 --> 01:08:46,957
Look, the lepers are queuing!

1315
01:08:46,998 --> 01:08:49,960
Her brother-in-law
is the ex-mayor of Gath.

1316
01:08:50,001 --> 01:08:54,089
Brian, can I introduce
the gentleman who's letting us
have the mounts on Sunday?

1317
01:08:54,130 --> 01:08:57,092
-[man] Hello.
-Don't push!

1318
01:08:57,133 --> 01:09:00,219
Now keep the noise down, please!

1319
01:09:00,261 --> 01:09:04,724
Those possessed by devils,
try and keep them under control
a bit, can't you?

1320
01:09:04,766 --> 01:09:07,560
Incurables, you'll just have
to wait for a few minutes.

1321
01:09:07,602 --> 01:09:12,315
Um... women taken in sin, line
up against that wall, will you?

1322
01:09:12,356 --> 01:09:15,192
[Judith] Brian?

1323
01:09:15,234 --> 01:09:17,612
Brian! You were fantastic!

1324
01:09:17,654 --> 01:09:19,405
You weren't so bad yourself.

1325
01:09:19,447 --> 01:09:21,240
No, what you said just now!

1326
01:09:21,282 --> 01:09:22,617
Quite extraordinary!

1327
01:09:22,659 --> 01:09:24,160
What? Oh, that. Was it?

1328
01:09:24,201 --> 01:09:26,245
We don't need any leaders!
You're so right!

1329
01:09:26,287 --> 01:09:28,623
Reg has been
dominating us for too long.

1330
01:09:28,665 --> 01:09:29,958
Well, yes--

1331
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,168
It needed saying,
and you said it, Brian!

1332
01:09:32,209 --> 01:09:33,753
You're very attractive.

1333
01:09:33,795 --> 01:09:36,923
It's our revolution!
We can all do it together!

1334
01:09:36,965 --> 01:09:38,091
I think... I think--

1335
01:09:38,133 --> 01:09:39,425
We're all behind you, Brian!

1336
01:09:39,467 --> 01:09:41,970
The revolution
is in your hands!

1337
01:09:42,012 --> 01:09:45,264
What? No, that's not
what I meant at all!

1338
01:09:45,306 --> 01:09:47,892
You're fucking nicked,
me old beauty!

1339
01:09:47,934 --> 01:09:50,061
-[dramatic music]
-Right!

1340
01:09:56,985 --> 01:09:58,820
Stop it!

1341
01:09:58,862 --> 01:10:00,363
[groans]

1342
01:10:00,404 --> 01:10:03,741
Well, Brian, you've given us
a good run for our money.

1343
01:10:03,783 --> 01:10:04,993
A what?

1344
01:10:05,035 --> 01:10:07,411
And this time,

1345
01:10:07,453 --> 01:10:10,665
I guarantee you will not escape.

1346
01:10:10,707 --> 01:10:15,211
Guard... do we have any
crucifixions today?

1347
01:10:15,252 --> 01:10:18,965
A hundred and thirty-nine, sir.
Special celebration.
Passover, sir.

1348
01:10:19,007 --> 01:10:21,759
Right! Now we have 140!

1349
01:10:21,801 --> 01:10:23,219
Nice round number, eh, Biggus?

1350
01:10:23,260 --> 01:10:24,679
[chuckles]

1351
01:10:24,721 --> 01:10:27,140
-[crowd clamoring]
-Hail Caesar!

1352
01:10:27,182 --> 01:10:28,808
Hail!

1353
01:10:28,850 --> 01:10:30,601
The crowd outside are
getting a bit restless, sir.

1354
01:10:30,643 --> 01:10:32,937
Permission to disperse them,
please.

1355
01:10:32,979 --> 01:10:35,815
Disperse them? But I haven't
addressed them yet!

1356
01:10:35,857 --> 01:10:37,400
Uh, no, I know, sir, but--

1357
01:10:37,441 --> 01:10:39,652
My address is one of
the high points of Passover!

1358
01:10:39,694 --> 01:10:43,447
My friend, Biggus Dickus,
has come all the way
from Rome just to hear it!

1359
01:10:43,489 --> 01:10:45,867
-Hail Caesar!
-[lisping] Hail Caesar!

1360
01:10:45,909 --> 01:10:49,162
You're not...

1361
01:10:49,204 --> 01:10:53,374
You're not thinking of giving
it a miss this year, then, sir?

1362
01:10:53,416 --> 01:10:55,168
Give it a miss?!

1363
01:10:55,210 --> 01:10:57,962
Well, it's just that they're in
a rather funny mood today, sir.

1364
01:10:58,004 --> 01:11:00,798
Really, centurion!
I'm surprised to hear
a man like you

1365
01:11:00,840 --> 01:11:03,634
rattled by
a rabble of rowdy rebels.

1366
01:11:03,676 --> 01:11:06,637
-A bit thundery, sir.
-Take him away!

1367
01:11:06,679 --> 01:11:09,891
I'm a Roman!
I can prove it, honestly!

1368
01:11:09,933 --> 01:11:13,228
And crucify him well!

1369
01:11:13,269 --> 01:11:14,395
Biggus!

1370
01:11:15,772 --> 01:11:17,148
[stammers] I really wouldn't,
sir!

1371
01:11:17,190 --> 01:11:18,649
Out of the way, centurion!

1372
01:11:18,691 --> 01:11:20,317
Let me come with you, Pontius.

1373
01:11:20,359 --> 01:11:23,071
I may be of some assistance
if there is a sudden crisis!

1374
01:11:25,198 --> 01:11:26,991
Right! Now, item four,

1375
01:11:27,033 --> 01:11:29,410
attainment of world supremacy
within the next five years.

1376
01:11:29,452 --> 01:11:31,370
Uh, Francis, you've been
doing some work on this?

1377
01:11:31,412 --> 01:11:32,747
Yeah, thank you, Reg.

1378
01:11:32,789 --> 01:11:34,665
Well, quite frankly, siblings,

1379
01:11:34,707 --> 01:11:38,211
I think five years is optimistic
unless we can
smash the Roman Empire

1380
01:11:38,253 --> 01:11:39,503
within the next 12 months!

1381
01:11:39,545 --> 01:11:41,214
-Twelve months?
-Yeah, 12 months.

1382
01:11:41,256 --> 01:11:42,590
And let's face it,

1383
01:11:42,632 --> 01:11:45,135
as empires go,
this is the big one.

1384
01:11:45,176 --> 01:11:48,721
So we gotta get up off our asses
and stop just talking about it!

1385
01:11:48,763 --> 01:11:50,681
[all] Hear! Hear!

1386
01:11:50,723 --> 01:11:53,643
I agree! It's action
that counts, not words,
and we need action now!

1387
01:11:53,684 --> 01:11:55,019
[all] Hear! Hear!

1388
01:11:55,061 --> 01:11:56,729
You're right. We could
sit around here all day,

1389
01:11:56,771 --> 01:12:00,357
talking, passing resolutions,
making clever speeches,

1390
01:12:00,399 --> 01:12:02,777
it's not gonna shift
one Roman soldier!

1391
01:12:02,819 --> 01:12:04,779
So let's just stop
gabbing on about it!

1392
01:12:04,821 --> 01:12:07,448
It's completely pointless
and it's getting us nowhere!

1393
01:12:07,490 --> 01:12:08,783
[all] Right!

1394
01:12:08,825 --> 01:12:10,868
I agree! This is a complete
waste of time!

1395
01:12:10,910 --> 01:12:12,203
[dramatic music]

1396
01:12:12,245 --> 01:12:13,037
They've arrested Brian!

1397
01:12:13,079 --> 01:12:14,664
[all] What?

1398
01:12:14,705 --> 01:12:17,292
They've dragged him off!
They're gonna crucify him!

1399
01:12:17,333 --> 01:12:20,170
Right! This calls
for immediate discussion!

1400
01:12:20,211 --> 01:12:21,671
-Yes.
-What?!

1401
01:12:21,712 --> 01:12:22,880
-Immediate!
-Right!

1402
01:12:22,922 --> 01:12:24,590
-New motion?
-Completely new motion!

1403
01:12:24,632 --> 01:12:29,262
Uh, that, uh... that
there be immediate action...

1404
01:12:29,304 --> 01:12:30,721
Uh, once the vote
has been taken.

1405
01:12:30,763 --> 01:12:32,265
Obviously,
once the vote's been taken.

1406
01:12:32,307 --> 01:12:33,724
Can't act on a resolution
until you've voted--

1407
01:12:33,766 --> 01:12:36,186
-Reg, let's go now, please!
-Right! Right!

1408
01:12:36,227 --> 01:12:40,273
In the light of
fresh information
from sibling Judith...

1409
01:12:40,315 --> 01:12:42,859
-Not so fast, Reg.
-Reg, for God's sake!

1410
01:12:42,900 --> 01:12:45,028
It's perfectly simple!

1411
01:12:45,069 --> 01:12:47,989
All you've gotta do is
to go out of that door now

1412
01:12:48,031 --> 01:12:50,992
and try to stop the Romans
nailing him up!

1413
01:12:51,034 --> 01:12:52,618
It's happening, Reg!

1414
01:12:52,660 --> 01:12:55,079
Something's actually happening,
Reg!

1415
01:12:55,121 --> 01:12:57,665
Can't you understand?

1416
01:12:57,707 --> 01:12:59,292
[frustrated scream]

1417
01:13:02,170 --> 01:13:03,046
[all snicker]

1418
01:13:03,087 --> 01:13:04,547
Yeah, hello.

1419
01:13:04,588 --> 01:13:06,465
Another little ego trip
from the feminists.

1420
01:13:06,507 --> 01:13:08,718
-What?
-Oh, sorry, Loretta.

1421
01:13:08,759 --> 01:13:11,095
Uh... read that back,
would you?

1422
01:13:11,137 --> 01:13:13,514
[ominous music]

1423
01:13:24,567 --> 01:13:25,818
Next.

1424
01:13:25,860 --> 01:13:27,904
-Crucifixion?
-Yes.

1425
01:13:27,945 --> 01:13:32,200
Good. Out of the door, line on
the left, one cross each.

1426
01:13:32,242 --> 01:13:33,826
Next.

1427
01:13:33,868 --> 01:13:35,703
-Crucifixion?
-Mm-hmm.

1428
01:13:35,745 --> 01:13:41,125
Good. Out of the door, line on
the left, one cross each. Next.

1429
01:13:41,167 --> 01:13:43,544
-Crucifixion?
-Uh, no, freedom.

1430
01:13:43,586 --> 01:13:44,670
Hmm?

1431
01:13:44,712 --> 01:13:46,130
-What?
-Uh, freedom for me.

1432
01:13:46,172 --> 01:13:48,216
They said I hadn't done anything
so I could go free

1433
01:13:48,258 --> 01:13:50,385
and live on an island somewhere.

1434
01:13:50,426 --> 01:13:52,303
Oh. Oh, well,
that's jolly good.

1435
01:13:52,345 --> 01:13:53,888
Well, off you go, then.

1436
01:13:53,930 --> 01:13:55,932
No, I'm only pulling your leg.
It's crucifixion, really.

1437
01:13:55,973 --> 01:13:58,517
Oh. I see.
Very good, very good.

1438
01:13:58,559 --> 01:14:00,519
Well, out of the door.

1439
01:14:00,561 --> 01:14:02,313
Yeah, I know the way.
Out of the door, one cross each,
line on the left.

1440
01:14:02,355 --> 01:14:05,233
Line on the left.
Yes, thank you.

1441
01:14:05,275 --> 01:14:06,234
Crucifixion?

1442
01:14:06,276 --> 01:14:07,318
-Yes.
-Good.

1443
01:14:07,360 --> 01:14:09,112
[fanfare plays]

1444
01:14:09,153 --> 01:14:10,863
[crowd cheering]

1445
01:14:18,955 --> 01:14:21,291
[cheering stops]

1446
01:14:21,332 --> 01:14:24,419
[speech impediment]
People of Jerusalem!

1447
01:14:24,460 --> 01:14:25,878
[crowd snickers]

1448
01:14:25,920 --> 01:14:29,048
Rome is your friend!

1449
01:14:29,090 --> 01:14:31,217
[crowd laughs]

1450
01:14:34,095 --> 01:14:38,099
To prove our friendship,
it is customary at this time

1451
01:14:38,141 --> 01:14:41,311
to release a wrongdoer
from our prisons.

1452
01:14:41,352 --> 01:14:44,105
-[crowd laughs]
-[guard snickers]

1453
01:14:46,774 --> 01:14:50,445
Whom would you have me release?

1454
01:14:50,486 --> 01:14:53,614
-[imitates speech impediment]
Release Roger!
-[all cheer]

1455
01:14:53,656 --> 01:14:56,451
[all] Release Roger!
Release Roger!

1456
01:14:56,492 --> 01:14:58,369
[all laugh]

1457
01:15:00,621 --> 01:15:05,209
Very well,
I shall release Roger!

1458
01:15:05,251 --> 01:15:08,129
[all cheer]

1459
01:15:08,171 --> 01:15:10,381
Sir, we don't have
a Roger, sir.

1460
01:15:10,423 --> 01:15:13,176
-What?
-We don't have anyone
of that name, sir.

1461
01:15:13,217 --> 01:15:17,513
Ah. We have no Roger!

1462
01:15:17,554 --> 01:15:20,057
[all groan]

1463
01:15:20,099 --> 01:15:23,060
-Well, what about Roderick,
then?
-Yeah!

1464
01:15:23,102 --> 01:15:26,730
[all] Release Roderick!
Release Roderick!

1465
01:15:26,772 --> 01:15:32,862
Centurion,
why do they titter so?

1466
01:15:32,903 --> 01:15:35,948
Just some, uh,
Jewish joke, sir.

1467
01:15:37,283 --> 01:15:40,495
Are they... ragging me?

1468
01:15:41,871 --> 01:15:43,998
Oh, no, sir!

1469
01:15:44,040 --> 01:15:45,333
[sputters]

1470
01:15:45,375 --> 01:15:49,753
Very well.
I shall release Roderick!

1471
01:15:49,795 --> 01:15:51,839
Sir,
we don't have a Roderick either.

1472
01:15:51,881 --> 01:15:54,884
-No Roger, no Roderick?
-Sorry, sir.

1473
01:15:54,925 --> 01:15:57,178
-Who is this--?
-[guard snickers]

1474
01:15:57,220 --> 01:16:00,139
Who is this Roderick
to whom you refer?

1475
01:16:00,181 --> 01:16:01,849
He is a robber!

1476
01:16:01,891 --> 01:16:03,059
[all laughing]

1477
01:16:03,100 --> 01:16:04,685
And a rapist!

1478
01:16:04,727 --> 01:16:06,020
[laughter continues]

1479
01:16:06,062 --> 01:16:08,064
And a pickpocket!

1480
01:16:08,105 --> 01:16:10,483
-[man] Yeah!
-[all shushing]

1481
01:16:11,734 --> 01:16:13,403
He sounds a notorious criminal.

1482
01:16:13,444 --> 01:16:16,364
We haven't got him, sir.

1483
01:16:16,406 --> 01:16:18,115
Do we have anyone
in our prisons at all?

1484
01:16:18,157 --> 01:16:19,700
Oh, yes, sir.
We've got a Samson, sir.

1485
01:16:19,742 --> 01:16:22,245
-Samson?
-Samson, the Sadducee Strangler,
sir.

1486
01:16:22,286 --> 01:16:25,122
Uh, Silas,
the Syrian Assassin.

1487
01:16:25,164 --> 01:16:28,625
Uh, several seditious scribes
from Caesarea.

1488
01:16:28,667 --> 01:16:30,378
Uh... sixty-seven--

1489
01:16:30,420 --> 01:16:32,255
[lisping] Let me speak to them,
Pontius!

1490
01:16:32,296 --> 01:16:34,798
-Oh, no!
-Ah, good idea, Biggus.

1491
01:16:34,840 --> 01:16:39,262
Citizens! We have Samson
the Sadducee Strangler,

1492
01:16:39,303 --> 01:16:41,972
-Silas the Assyrian Assassin...
-[crowd laughing]

1493
01:16:42,014 --> 01:16:45,809
...several seditious scribes
from Caesarea and...

1494
01:16:45,851 --> 01:16:48,104
Next.

1495
01:16:48,145 --> 01:16:49,480
Crucifixion?

1496
01:16:49,522 --> 01:16:51,274
-Yes.
-Good.

1497
01:16:51,315 --> 01:16:53,859
Out of the door,
line on the left,
one cross each.

1498
01:16:53,901 --> 01:16:55,528
-Jailor--
-Excuse me?

1499
01:16:55,570 --> 01:16:56,779
There's been some
sort of a mistake.

1500
01:16:56,820 --> 01:16:58,155
Just a moment,
would you? Jailor?

1501
01:16:58,197 --> 01:17:02,785
-How many have come through?
-What?

1502
01:17:02,826 --> 01:17:05,788
Uh, how many have come through?

1503
01:17:05,829 --> 01:17:07,123
What?

1504
01:17:07,164 --> 01:17:08,958
You'll have to speak...

1505
01:17:08,999 --> 01:17:12,253
[stammers]

1506
01:17:12,295 --> 01:17:14,547
Speak up a bit, sir.
He's d...

1507
01:17:14,589 --> 01:17:16,799
-[stammers]
-Oh.

1508
01:17:16,840 --> 01:17:20,136
He's deaf as a post, sir.

1509
01:17:20,177 --> 01:17:21,137
Um...

1510
01:17:21,178 --> 01:17:24,723
How many have come through?

1511
01:17:27,893 --> 01:17:30,813
-Oh, dear.
-I make it 90...

1512
01:17:30,854 --> 01:17:32,607
[stammers]

1513
01:17:35,526 --> 01:17:37,445
Ninety-six, sir.

1514
01:17:37,487 --> 01:17:40,156
It's such a senseless waste
of human life, isn't it?

1515
01:17:40,197 --> 01:17:41,865
No, sir!

1516
01:17:41,907 --> 01:17:46,745
Not with these...
bastards, sir!

1517
01:17:46,787 --> 01:17:48,372
[stammers]

1518
01:17:52,209 --> 01:17:54,962
Crucifixion's too good
for them, sir.

1519
01:17:55,004 --> 01:17:57,756
I don't think you could
say it's good for them,
it's very nasty!

1520
01:17:57,798 --> 01:17:59,175
Oh, it's not as n...

1521
01:17:59,216 --> 01:18:00,593
[stammers]

1522
01:18:02,761 --> 01:18:05,515
Not as nasty as something
I just thought up, sir.

1523
01:18:05,556 --> 01:18:06,390
-Um...
-Huh?

1524
01:18:06,432 --> 01:18:08,017
Now, um, crucifixion?

1525
01:18:08,058 --> 01:18:09,560
Is there someone
I could speak to?

1526
01:18:09,602 --> 01:18:13,063
-Well--
-I know where to get it
if you want it.

1527
01:18:13,105 --> 01:18:15,899
-What?
-Don't worry about him, sir.

1528
01:18:15,941 --> 01:18:17,234
He's... [stammers]

1529
01:18:19,736 --> 01:18:22,448
He's deaf and mad, sir.

1530
01:18:22,490 --> 01:18:24,450
Well, how did he get the job?

1531
01:18:24,492 --> 01:18:26,743
Bloody Pilate's pet, sir!

1532
01:18:26,785 --> 01:18:28,496
Get a move on, big nose!

1533
01:18:28,538 --> 01:18:31,040
There's people waiting to be
crucified out here! [laughs]

1534
01:18:31,081 --> 01:18:33,250
Could I see a lawyer
or someone?

1535
01:18:33,292 --> 01:18:34,793
Um, do you have a lawyer?

1536
01:18:34,835 --> 01:18:36,379
No, but I'm a Roman.

1537
01:18:36,420 --> 01:18:38,881
How about a retrial?
We've got plenty of time.

1538
01:18:38,922 --> 01:18:41,008
-Shut up, you!
-Miserable, bloody Romans!

1541
01:18:44,970 --> 01:18:48,057
Can you go straight out,
line on the left,
one cross each.

1542
01:18:48,098 --> 01:18:49,141

Was it something I said?

1545
01:19:02,738 --> 01:19:03,822
Silence!

1546
01:19:05,575 --> 01:19:07,201

1547

1553
01:19:26,136 --> 01:19:27,722
Morning.

1554
01:19:27,763 --> 01:19:30,307
Now, we will be on show
as we go through the town,

1555
01:19:30,349 --> 01:19:32,435
so let's not let the side down!

1556
01:19:32,476 --> 01:19:35,438
Keep in a good, straight line,
three lengths between you
and the man in front

1557
01:19:35,479 --> 01:19:37,607
and a good, steady pace.

1558
01:19:37,648 --> 01:19:39,775
Crosses over
your left shoulders,

1559
01:19:39,816 --> 01:19:41,818
and if you keep
your backs hard up

1560
01:19:41,860 --> 01:19:44,321
against the crossbeam
you'll be there in no time.

1561
01:19:45,406 --> 01:19:46,574
All right, centurion!

-What do you think you're doing?

didn't he?

no Rubens,

Well, go and free him,

Get a move on, there!

-Or what?
-Or you'll be in trouble!

1598
01:21:34,473 --> 01:21:38,769
Oh, dear. You mean I might
have to give up being crucified
in the afternoons?

1599
01:21:38,811 --> 01:21:41,605
-Shut up!
-That would be a blow,
wouldn't it?

Oh, thank you!

Have they gone?

1603
01:21:51,448 --> 01:21:55,244
We've got lumps of it
around the back.

1604
01:21:55,285 --> 01:21:56,871
What?

Oh... [stammers]

-Oh, come on.
-Yes, sir.

Anyway, get on
with the story.

1612

Well, I just never really
liked them, so I just--

Right! The motion to get on with
it passed with one abstention.

1614

I propose we go without further
ado. May I have a second?

01:22:31,822 --> 01:22:33,990
-Let's just go.
-Yeah, all right.

-Oh, yeah. Don't worry.

-I never forget a face.
-No?

1624

I warn you. I'm gonna punch
you so hard, you Roman git!

1625
01:23:09,192 --> 01:23:11,445
Shut up,
you Jewish turd!

1626
01:23:11,487 --> 01:23:13,280
Who are you calling Jewish?

1627
01:23:13,322 --> 01:23:15,866
I'm not Jewish, I'm a Samaritan!

1628
01:23:15,908 --> 01:23:18,786
A Samaritan? This is supposed
to be a Jewish section!

1629
01:23:18,828 --> 01:23:22,706
It doesn't matter!
You're all gonna die
in a day or two!

1630
01:23:22,748 --> 01:23:26,293
It may not matter to you, Roman,
but it certainly matters to us,
doesn't it, darling?

1631
01:23:26,335 --> 01:23:27,753
Oh, rather!

1632
01:23:27,795 --> 01:23:29,964
Under the terms
of the Roman occupancy,

1633
01:23:30,005 --> 01:23:32,883
we're entitled to be crucified
in a purely Jewish area.

01:23:32,925 --> 01:23:35,511

from Sadducees!

don't want to be crucified here!

Uh, look, it's not my cross.

-What?
-Um, it's not my cross.

1642
01:23:54,905 --> 01:23:56,323
I was holding it for someone.

1643
01:23:56,365 --> 01:23:58,534
Just lie down,
I haven't got all day!

1644
01:23:58,575 --> 01:24:00,786
No, of course. Look,
I hate to make a fuss--

1645

Look, we've had a busy day,
there's 140 of you lot
to get up.

-Is he Jewish?
-Will you be quiet?!

1647
01:24:07,001 --> 01:24:09,294
We don't want any more
Samaritans around here.

Belt up!

1649
01:24:10,713 --> 01:24:12,422
Will you let me down
if he comes back?

1650
01:24:12,464 --> 01:24:15,175
Yeah, yeah, we'll let
you down. Next!

1651
01:24:15,217 --> 01:24:18,094
You don't have to do this!
You don't have to take orders!

You're being rescued
then, are you?

It's a bit late
for that now, isn't it?

Oh, no, we've got
a couple of days up here.

Thank God you've come, Reg.

Um, yes, I think I should
point out first, Brian,
in all fairness,

1670

that we are not, in fact,

to read the following
