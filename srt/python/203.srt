And the very fact
that the plane is
continuously vibrating

Since then, uh, McTeagle has
developed his literary scope.

Three years ago he concerned
himself with quite small sums:

Quick bits of ready cash,
sixpences, shillings.

307

his extraordinary
literary perception

309
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:26,240

to match the huge sweep,
