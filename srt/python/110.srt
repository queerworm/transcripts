00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:10,600

for the last 20 years.
I want a new job.

178
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,720
Something exciting
that will let me live.

179
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:15,400
Well, chartered accountancy
is rather exciting, isn't it?

180
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:18,240
Exciting? No, it's not.

181
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:21,120
It's dull. Dull, dull.

182
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:23,360
My God, it's dull.

183
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,480
It's so desperately dull,

184
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:29,240
and tedious
and stuffy and boring

185
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:31,440
and desperately dull.

186
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:35,200
Well, uh, yes, Mr. Anchovy,
but you see, your report here

187
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:38,440
says that you are
an extremely dull person.

188
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,640
You see,
our experts describe you

189
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:42,640
as an appallingly
dull fellow.

190
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:45,880
"Unimaginative, timid,
lacking in initiative,

191
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,920
spineless, easily dominated,

drab and awful."

194
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:55,360
And, uh, whereas
in most professions

195
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:57,600
these would be
considerable drawbacks,

196
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:00,840
in chartered accountancy
they're a positive boon.

197
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:03,720
But don't you see,
I came here to find a new job.

198
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:07,520
A new life.
A new meaning to my existence.
Can't you help me?

199
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:10,720
Well, do you have any idea
of what you want to do?

200
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:12,960
-Yes. Yes, I have.
-What?

201
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Lion-taming.

202
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,960
Yes, yes.

203
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,640
Of course, it's a bit
of a jump, isn't it?

204
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:24,960
I mean, chartered accountancy
to lion-taming in one go.

205
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,960
You don't think
it might be better

206
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,600
if you worked your way
towards lion-taming,
say via banking, or--?

207
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:31,800
No! No, no, no!
I don't want to wait.

208
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:35,240
At 9:00 tomorrow,
I want to be in there, taming.

209
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:37,560
Fine, fine.
But, uh, do you--?

210
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,120
Do you have any
qualifications?

211
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:40,120
Yes, I've got a hat.

212
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,840
-A hat?
-Yes, a hat.

213
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:45,000
A lion-taming hat.
A hat, with "lion-tamer" on it.

214
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:48,400
I got it at Harrods and it
lights up, saying, "lion-tamer"

215
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:50,040
in great big neon letters,

216
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:52,120
so you can tame them after dark,
when they're less stroppy.

217
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,520
I see, I see.

Yes, yes, I do follow,
Mr. Anchovy, but you see,
the snag is,

221
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:06,920
if I now call Mr. Chipperfield
and say to him:

222
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:09,480
"Uh, look here,
I've got a 45-year-old

223

chartered accountant with me
who wants to become
a lion-tamer,"

224
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:14,720
his first question
is not going to be,

225
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:17,160
"Does he have his own hat?"

226
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:20,040
He's going to ask
what sort of experience
you've had with lions.

227
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:22,360
Well, I--
I've seen them at the zoo.

228
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:24,480
Good, good, good.

229
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:28,160
Yes, they're brown furry things
with short, stumpy legs
and great long noses.

230
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:30,840
I don't know what all the fuss
is about. I could tame one.

231
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,480
They look pretty tame
to start with.

232
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:36,840
Heh, heh. And these, um--
these lions, how high are they?

233
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,200
Well, they're about so high,
you know.

234
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,800
-Mm-hm.
-They don't frighten me at all.

And do these lions eat ants?

-Mm-hm.

00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:48,440
Uh, well,
Mr. Anchovy, I'm afraid

238
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,760
what you've got hold of there,
is an anteater.

239
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:54,640
-A what?
-An anteater. Not a lion.

240
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:57,080
You see, a lion
is a huge savage beast,

ten-feet long,

ask to see
the chief librarian,

see their faces
