This week,<i> The World Around Us</i>
looks at the growing social
phenomenon of mice and men.

518
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:52,000
What makes a man
want to be a mouse?

519
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:55,480
Well, uh...

520
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:58,440
it's not a question of
wanting to be a mouse.

521
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:00,840
It just sort of
happens to you.

522
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:03,200
Um...

523
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:05,320
all of a sudden
you realize...

524
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:09,000
that's what
you want to be.

525
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:12,360
And when did you first notice
these, shall we say, tendencies?

526
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:15,880
Well, I was about 17,

527
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:19,480
and some mates and me
went to a party.

528
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:22,840
And, uh...

529
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:25,040
Well, we had quite
a lot to drink, and then...

530
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:28,280
some of the fellows there...

531
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:31,560
started handing...
cheese around.

532
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:38,400
Well, just out of curiosity
I tried a bit and...

533
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:41,080
-Well, that was that.
-Yes.

534
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:43,320
And what else
did these fellows do?

535
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:48,520
Well, uh...
some of them started

536
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:52,680
dressing up as mice
a bit, um...

537
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:56,600
And then when they got
the costumes on, they...

538
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:01,000
started... squeaking.

539
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:02,880
-And was that all?
-That was all.

540
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:04,760
And what was
your reaction to this?

541
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:06,440
-Well, I was shocked.
-Yes.

542
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:07,480
But, uh...

543
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:11,520
Gradually I came to feel...

544
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:15,760
that I was more at ease
with other mice.
