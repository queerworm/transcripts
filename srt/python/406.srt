525
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:47,040
<i>But Pratt and Z. Pratt dug in</i>
<i>and took the score to a half</i>

526
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:50,080
<i>before Z. Pratt ran away.</i>

[YELLING]

528
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:56,760
<i>But out came M.J.K. Pratt</i>

529
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:59,280
<i>to play a real</i>
<i>captain's innings.</i>

530
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:02,040
<i>He'd taken his own score</i>
<i>up to naught</i>

531
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:05,040
<i>when he mistimed a shot</i>
<i>of Bowanga and was lbw.</i>

532
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:14,920
<i>Typical of Umbonga's</i>
<i>hostile opening spell</i>

533
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,880
<i>was his dismissal</i>
<i>of V.E. Pratt,</i>

534
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:20,040
<i>who offered no resistance</i>
<i>to this delivery.</i>

535
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:25,040
<i>And he was caught behind.</i>

536
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:30,520
But by lunch, the situation
had changed dramatically.

537
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:09,200
And so with the
tension colossal

538
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:10,720
as we come up to
the last ball,

539
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:12,240
that's all from us.

541
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:39,840
Good evening.
Over 400,000 million pounds

542
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:42,480
were wiped off the value
of shares this afternoon,

543
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:46,080
when someone
in the stock exchange coughed.

544
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:49,320
Sport. Capital punishment
is to be reintroduced

545
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:51,240
in the first
and second division.

546
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:54,360
Any player found tackling from
behind or controlling the ball

547
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:58,000
with the lower part of the arm
will be hanged.

548
00:26:58,040 --> 00:27:00,720
But the electric chair remains
the standard punishment

549
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:02,760
for threatening the goalie.

550
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:04,520
Referees chairman,
Len Goebbels said:

551
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:08,040
"At last the referee
has been given teeth."

552
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:11,320
Finally, politics. The latest
opinion poll published today

553
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:13,600
shows Labor ahead
with 40 percent,

554

the AA, second with
38 percent,

555
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:18,760
and not surprisingly,
Kentucky Fried Chicken

556
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:21,000
running the Liberals
a very close third.

557
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:23,880
And now back to me. Hello.

558
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:27,040
And now it's time to go over
to Hugh Delaney at Paignton.

559
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:28,560
Hello,

560
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:30,040
Because it's from Paignton

561
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:31,960
we take you straight back
to the studio.

562
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,720
Hello. And it's from here
we go over there.

Well, we're already here,

Welcome back.

And now it's time for
part eight of our series

566
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:43,840
about the life and work
of Ursula Hitler,

567
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:46,160
