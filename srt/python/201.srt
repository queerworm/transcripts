Hello. Tonight on

On my left is the minister
for home affairs,

10
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:56,280
who is wearing a striking
organza dress in pink tulle

11
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59,560
with matching pearls
and a diamante collar necklace.

12

or some extract used
in industrial varnishing.

00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:26,320
Good evening.

23
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:28,880
Minister, may I put
the first question to you?

24
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:31,080
In your plan,
"A Better Britain For Us,"

25
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:32,880
you claimed
that you would build

26
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:35,840
88,000 million, billion
houses a year

27
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:38,840
in the Greater London
area alone.

28
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:42,200
In fact, you've built only
three in the last 15 years.

29
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,880
Are you a bit disappointed
with this result?

30
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:47,320
No, no. I'd like to answer
this question if I may

31
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,760
in two ways.

32
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,560
Firstly in my normal voice

33
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:53,280
and then in a kind of silly,
high-pitched whine.

34
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:55,240
You see,
housing is a problem really.

35
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,840
Well, while the minister
is answering this question,

36
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:59,680
I'd just like to point out

37
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:02,240
that the minister's dress
has been made entirely by hand

38

00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:18,480
and then threaten
to beat him up

341
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:21,240
if he paid them the so-called
protection money.

342
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:23,880
Four months later,
they started another operation

343
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:26,480
which they called:
"The Other Operation."

344
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:29,160
In this racket they selected
another victim and threatened

345
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,840
not to beat him up
if he didn't pay them.

346
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:35,400
One month later, they hit upon
"The Other, Other Operation."

347
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,240
In this the victim
was threatened

348
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,240
that if he didn't pay them,
they would beat him up.

349
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:42,320
This, for the Piranha brothers,
was the turning point.

350
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:45,600
Doug and Dinsdale Piranha
now formed a gang

351
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:47,920
which they called "The Gang,"

352
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,640
and used terror
to take over nightclubs,

353
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:51,920
billiard halls, gaming casinos
and racetracks.

354
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:53,960
When they tried
to take over the MCC,

355
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,160
they were for the only time
in their lives, slit up a treat.

356
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,600
As their empire spread
however, we in Q Division

357
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:01,280
were keeping tabs
on their every movement

358
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:03,160
by reading
the color supplements.

359
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:06,320
A small-time operator who
fell foul of Dinsdale Piranha

360
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:08,920
was Vince Snetterton-Lewis.

361
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:11,360
Well, uh, one day
I was sitting at home

362
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,520
threatening the kids

363
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:15,800
and I looked out of the hole
in the wall

364
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:18,320
and I saw this tank drive up.

365
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:20,640
And one of Dinsdale's boys
gets out,

366
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:23,320
and he comes up,
all nice and friendly like,

367
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:25,960
and says Dinsdale
wants to have a talk with me.

368
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,400
So he chains me
to the back of the tank,

369
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:31,440
and takes me for a scrape
round to Dinsdale's.

370
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:35,040
And Dinsdale's there
in the conversation pit

371
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:38,960
with Doug and Charles Paisley,
the baby crusher,

372
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,960
and a couple of film producers

373
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,960
and a man they called
Kierkegaard

374
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,280
who just sat there
biting the heads off whippets.

375
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:47,200
And Dinsdale said:

376
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:49,680
"I hear you've been
a naughty boy, Clement."

377
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:52,560
And he splits me nostrils open
and saws me leg off

378
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:54,600
and pulls me liver out.

379
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:57,480
And I said,
"My name's not Clement."

380
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:00,360
And, uh,
then he loses his temper.

381
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,320
And he nails my head
to the floor.

382
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:04,280
INTERVIEWER:
He nailed your head
to the floor?

383
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:05,880
At first, yeah.

384
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:08,760
Another man who had his head
nailed to the floor

385
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:10,720
was Stig O'Tracey.

386
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:12,960
Stig, I've been told
that Dinsdale Piranha

387
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,480
nailed your head
to the floor.

388
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:18,120
No.
No, never, never.

389
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,840
He was
a smashing bloke.

390
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:22,120
He used to give his mother
flowers and that.

391
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:23,840
He was like
a brother to me.

392
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:26,240
But the police have film
of Dinsdale

393
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:29,360
actually nailing your head
to the floor.

394
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:31,560
Oh, yeah, well,
he did that, yeah.

395
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,200
Why?

396
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:35,440
Well, he had to, didn't he?
I mean, be fair,

397
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:37,320
there was nothing else
he could do.

398
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:39,320
I mean, I had transgressed
the unwritten law.

399
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,240
What had you done?

400
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:43,480
Uh...

401
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:45,320
Well,
he never told me that.

402
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:47,440
But he gave me his word
that it was the case,

403
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:49,960
and that's good enough
for me with old Dinsy.

404
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,120
I mean, he didn't wanna
nail my head to the floor.

405
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:54,880
I had to insist.
He wanted to let me off.

406
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:57,120
There's nothing Dinsdale
wouldn't do for you.

407
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:58,920
And you don't bear him
any grudge?

408
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:02,560
A grudge? Old Dinsy?
He was a real darling.

409
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:04,920
I understand he also nailed
your wife's head

410
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,480
to a coffee table.

411
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:08,040
Isn't that right,
Mrs. O'Tracey?

412
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:10,760
Oh, no, no, no.

413
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:14,080
Yeah, well, he did do that.
Yeah, yeah.

414
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:17,040
He was a cruel man,
but fair.

415
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:19,320
INTERVIEWER:
Vince, after he nailed
your head to the floor,

416
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,080
did you ever see him again?

417
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:24,560
Yeah, after that I used
to go around to his flat

418
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:27,320
every Sunday lunchtime
to apologize,

419
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:29,200
and we'd shake hands

420
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:31,080
and then he'd nail my head
to the floor.

421
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:32,160
Every Sunday?

422
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,440
Yeah.

423
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:35,200
But he was very reasonable
about it.

424
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:36,760
I mean, one Sunday

425
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,760
when my parents
were coming round for tea,

426
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:40,400
I asked him if he'd mind
very much

427
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:42,400
not nailing my head
to the floor that week.

428
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:44,000
And he agreed,

429
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:46,760
and just screwed my pelvis
to a cake stand.

430
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:48,560
He was the only friend
I ever had.

431
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:51,000
[COUGHING]

432
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:54,080
I wouldn't hear a word
against him.

433
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:56,240
MAN:
<i>Lovely fella.</i>

434
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:59,600
Clearly, Dinsdale inspired
tremendous loyalty and terror

435
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:01,160
amongst his business
associates,

436
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,520
but what was he really like?

437
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:06,560
I walked out with Dinsdale
on many occasions

438
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:09,080
and found him
a most charming

439
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,760
and erudite companion.

440
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:14,280
He was wont
to introduce one

441
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:16,640
to many eminent persons,

442
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:20,080
celebrated American singers,
members of the aristocracy

443
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:21,640
and other gang leaders.

444
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:23,560
INTERVIEWER:
How had he met them?

445
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,200
Through his work for charity.

446
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:26,920
He took a warm interest

447
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,520
in boys' clubs,
sailors' homes,

448
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:32,680
choristers' associations,
scouting jamborees

449
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:35,280
and of course,
the household cavalry.

450
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:37,920
Was there anything
unusual about him?

451
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:40,080
I should say not.

452
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:43,800
Dinsdale was a perfectly
normal person in every way.

453
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:47,040
Except...

454
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:50,120
Except in as much
as he was convinced

455
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:54,000
that he was being watched
by a giant hedgehog

456
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:56,920
whom he referred to
as Spiny Norman.

457
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,560
How big was Norman
supposed to be?

458
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,480
Normally, he was wont to be

459
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:04,040
about 12 feet
from snout to tail,

460
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:07,240
but when Dinsdale
was very depressed,

461
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:11,000
Norman could be anything
up to 800 yards long.

462
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:14,440
When Norman was about,
Dinsdale would go very quiet,

463
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:18,080
and his nose would swell up
and his teeth would start

464
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:20,480
moving about
and he'd become very violent

465
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:23,480
and claim that he'd laid
Stanley Baldwin.

466
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:25,800
Dinsdale was a gentleman.

467
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:29,560
And what's more he knew how
to treat a female
impersonator.

468
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:36,080
It's easy for us to judge
Dinsdale Piranha too harshly.

469
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:39,320
After all, he only did
what most of us--

470
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:42,440
Most of us
simply dream of doing.

472
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:50,000
I'm sorry.

473
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:51,960
After all, a murder--

474
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,880
A murderer is only
an extroverted suicide.

475
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,960
Dinsdale was a loony,

476
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,000
but he was a happy loony.

477
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:05,560
Lucky bastard.

478
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:08,440
Most of these strange tales
concern Dinsdale,

479
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,160
but what of Doug?

480
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:13,080
One man who met him
was Luigi Vercotti.

481
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:16,360
Well, I've been running
a successful escort agency--

482
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,720
High-class. No, really,
high-class girls.

483
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:20,920
We didn't have any of that.
That was right out.

484
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,360
And I decided--

485
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:25,040
-[TELEPHONE RINGS]
-Oh, excuse me.

486
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:26,640
Hello?

00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:28,200
Oh, no, not now.

488
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:30,120
Shtoom, shtoom.

489
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:36,640
Right. Yes, we'll have
the watch ready
for you at midnight.

490
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:38,760
The watch.

491
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:43,400
The Chinese watch.

492
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,520
Yes, all right. Bye-bye...

494
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:50,960
Anyway I decided then to
open a high-class nightclub

495
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
for the gentry
at Biggleswade.

496
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:56,320
With international cuisine,
cooking, top-line acts,

497
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:58,320
eh, not a cheap clip joint
for picking up tarts.

498
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:00,400
That was right out.
I deny that completely.

499
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:02,520
And, uh,

500
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:04,280
one night Dinsdale
walked in

501
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:06,320
with a couple
of big lads,

502
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:09,760
one of whom was carrying
a tactical nuclear missile.

503
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:12,280
They said I'd bought one
of their fruit machines

504
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:13,960
and would I pay for it?

505
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,840
How much did they want?

506
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:18,400
Uh, three quarters
of a million pounds.

507
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:20,040
Then they went out.

508
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:23,120
Why didn't you call
for the police?

509
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:26,720
Well, I'd noticed that the lad
with the thermonuclear device

510
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:29,440
was the chief constable
for the area.

511
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:32,200
Anyway, a week later,

512
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:33,880
they come back,

513
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:36,040
said the check had bounced

514
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:38,040
and that I had to
see Doug.

515
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:39,320
Doug?

516
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:41,960
Doug.

517
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:50,520
I was terrified of him.

518
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:53,280
Everyone was terrified
of Doug.

519
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:55,640
I've seen grown men
pull their own heads off

520
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:58,280
rather than see Doug.

521
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:00,520
Even Dinsdale
was frightened of Doug.

522
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:02,280
What did he do?

523
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:09,160
He used sarcasm.

524
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:11,760
He knew all the tricks,
dramatic irony, metaphor,

525
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:15,160
pathos, puns, parody, litotes

526
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:18,200
and... satire.

527
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:21,040
REPORTER:
<i>By a combination</i>
<i>of violence and sarcasm,</i>

528
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:23,440
<i>the Piranha brothers</i>
<i>by February, 1966,</i>

529
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:25,280
<i>controlled London</i>
<i>and the southeast.</i>

530
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:28,280
<i>In February, though,</i>
<i>Dinsdale made a big mistake.</i>

531
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,120
Latterly Dinsdale had become

532
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:32,880
increasingly worried
about Spiny Norman.

533
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:36,160
He had come to the conclusion
that Norman slept

534
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:40,200
in an aeroplane hangar
at Luton Airport.

535
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:44,600
And so on February the 22nd,
1966, at Luton Airport--

536
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:50,800
Even the police began
to sit up and take notice.

537
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:53,920
The Piranhas realized
they had gone too far

538
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:55,240
and that the hunt was on.

539
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:56,640
They went into hiding

540
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:58,200
and I decided
on a subtle approach,

541
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:00,680
viz. some form of disguise,

542
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,680
as the old helmet and boots
are a bit of a giveaway.

543
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,800
Luckily my years
with Bristol Rep

544
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:06,480
stood me in good stead,

545
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:09,080
as I assumed a bewildering
variety of disguises.

546
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:10,560
I tracked them to Cardiff,

547
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:13,000
posing as
the Reverend Smiler Egret.

548
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:14,640
Hearing they'd gone back
to London,

549
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:15,960
I assumed the identity

550
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,440
of a pork butcher,
Brian Stoats.

551
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:20,120
On my arrival in London,

552
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:22,760
I discovered
they had returned to Cardiff.

553
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:26,440
I followed as Gloucester
from<i> King Lear.</i>

554
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:28,760
Acting on a hunch,
I spent several months

555
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:31,080
in Buenos Aires as Blind Pew,

556
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:33,240
returning through
the Panama Canal

557
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:35,560
as Ratty
in<i> Toad of Toad Hall.</i>

558
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:38,440
Back in Cardiff,
I relived my triumph

559
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:41,720
as Sancho Panza
in<i> Man of La Mancha.</i>

560
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:44,240
Which the<i> Bristol</i>
<i>Evening Post</i> described as:

561
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:47,400
"A glittering performance
of a rare perception."

562
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:50,280
Although the<i> Bath Chronicle</i> was
less than enthusiastic.

563
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:52,880
In fact, it gave me
a right panning. I quote:

564
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:54,440
CRITIC 1:
<i>As for the performance</i>

565

<i>of Superintendent Harry</i>
<i>"Snapper" Organs</i>

00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:58,400
<i>as Sancho Panza,</i>
<i>the audience were bemused</i>

567
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:00,200
<i>by his high-pitched</i>
<i>Welsh accent</i>

568
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:02,280
<i>and intimidated</i>

<i>choreographed rape scene</i>

572

573
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:13,640
<i>of "What's all this then?"</i>

574
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:17,680
Never mind, Snapper love,
you can't win 'em all.

575
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:20,600
True, constable. Uh, could
I have my eyeliner please?

576
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:21,960

577
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,400
Ooh, good-o.
I bet it's from Binkie.

00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:27,840

waiting outside.

Oh, good.
Heh-heh.

Oh, blimey,
I'm on.

Is me hat straight,
constable?

584
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:35,600
Oh, it's fine.

585
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:37,320
Right. Here we go then,
Hawkins.

586
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:39,000
Oh,<i> merde,</i>
superintendent.

587
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:41,240
Good luck, then.

588
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:55,880
Read all about it.
