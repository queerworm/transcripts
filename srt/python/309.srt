508
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,320
are relatively inexpensive.

509
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:18,320
Still in the region
of 9 to 10 million pounds,

510
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:21,560
but it does seem to indicate
that Algon might be
a very good planet

511
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:24,240
for those with larger gardens.

512
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:26,720
Perhaps even an orchard
that's been left for two years,

513
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:28,760
needs some heavy work,
some weeding.

514
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:31,760
Uh, but we're now getting
some live pictures
through from Algon.

515
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:33,880
Harry, perhaps you could
talk us through them.

516
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:36,240
HARRY:
<i>Very little evidence</i>
<i>of shopping facilities here.</i>

517
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:38,760
<i>There don't seem to be</i>
<i>any large supermarkets.</i>

518
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:41,560
<i>Uh, there may be some</i>
<i>on-the-corner grocery stores</i>
<i>behind those rocks,</i>

519
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:44,080
<i>but it's difficult to tell</i>
<i>from this angle.</i>

520
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:47,920
<i>It does seem to suggest</i>
<i>that most of the shopping here</i>
<i>is by direct mail.</i>

521
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:51,160
Well, of course the big question
that everyone's asking here

522
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:54,200
is what about
those split-crotch panties?

523
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,400
Are they going to be
unobtainable throughout
the universe,

524
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:59,040
or merely on Algon itself?
Professor.

525
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:03,240
We must remember that Algon
is over 75,000 miles wide.

526
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:05,320
The probes come down
in this area here,

527
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:07,760
and we're really only getting
signals from a radius

528
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:09,520
of 30 or 40 miles
around the probe.

529
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:11,400
Uh, split-crotch panties,

530
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:14,600
or, indeed, any items
of what we scientists call

531
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:17,880
sexy underwear
or erotic lingerie

532
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:20,920
may be much more plentiful
on other parts of the planet.

533
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:23,520
Professor, you were
responsible for finding
scanty-panties

534
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:25,920
and Golden Goddess
High-Lift Bras

535
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:29,200
on planets which weren't
thought able to sustain life.

536
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:31,760
And now that man has
discovered a new galaxy,

537
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:34,440
do you think we're going to see
underwear become even naughtier?

538
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:36,040
Oh, naughtier
and naughtier.

539
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:37,520
Well, so much for that.

540
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:39,080
But of course,
the probe itself

541
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:40,960
has excited
a great deal of interest,

542
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:44,160
for it contains uranium-based
dual-transmission cells

543
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:46,600
entirely recharged
by solar radiation,

544
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:48,280
which can take off
a bra and panties

545
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:50,560
in less than 15 seconds.

546
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:53,320
It is, of course, the first
piece of space hardware

547
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:55,600
to be specially designed
to undress ladies,

548
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:57,840
and so there are bound to be
some teething troubles,

549
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:59,600
such as how to cope
with the combination

550
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:02,240
of elastic-sided
boots and tights.

551
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:04,040
But I think we're getting
some pictures now

552
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:05,760
from Algon itself.

553
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:07,280
And it looks as though-- Yes!

554
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:09,600
The satellite
has found a bird.

555
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:13,240
The probe has struck crumpet,
and she looks pretty good too.
Professor?

556
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:14,920
Yeah, she's a real honey.

557
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,640
ANNOUNCER:
The pictures
are a bit sporadic.

558
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:18,560
I think probably

562
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:26,200
Oh, dear, I'm sorry,
we've lost contact.

563
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:28,960
We'll try and re-established
contact with Algon...

564
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:32,080
Uh, hello.

565
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:34,800
Uh, the BBC have offered me
the sum of 40p,

566
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:36,800
uh, to read the credits
of this show.

567
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:39,040
Personally, I thought
I should have held out
for the full 75,

568
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:42,000
but the BBC have explained to me
about their
financial difficulties,

569
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:45,160
and, uh, I decided to accept
the reduced offer.

570
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:48,200
So, uh, the show was conceived,
written and performed

571
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:49,880
by, uh, the usual lot.

572
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:51,840
Uh, also appearing
were Carol Cleveland,

573
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:54,400
uh, Marie Anderson,
uh, Mrs. Idle.

Produced by Ian MacNaughton

584
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:16,680
for 92p and a bottle
of Bell's whiskey.

585
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:18,280
It was a BBC color production.

586
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:20,000
Uh, and I think that's
just it.

587
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:21,760
I'd like to say,
if there are any, uh,
