Now, um, where were we?
Oh, yes.
Eddie-baby, when you first--

177
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:12,160
I'm sorry. I'm sorry,
I don't like being called
"Eddie-baby."

178
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:15,600
-I'm sorry?
-I don't like being
called "Eddie-baby."

179
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:18,120
-Did I call you "Eddie-baby"?
-Yes, you did.

180
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,800
Now, get on with it.

181
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:21,200
Don't think I did call
you "Eddie-baby."

182
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,720
You did call me
"Eddie-baby".

183
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:23,880
Did I call him "Eddie-baby?"

184
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:26,400
-AUDIENCE: Yes. Yes.
-MAN: No.

185
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,920
I didn't really call you
"Eddie-baby," did I, sweetie?

186
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,760
Don't call me "sweetie"!

187
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,600
-Can I call you "sugar plum"?
-No!

188
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,520
-Pussycat? Angel drawers?
-No!

189
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,360
No, you may not.
Now get on with it.

00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,560
-Frank?
-What?

191
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,040
-Can I call you "Frank"?
-Why Frank?

192
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:41,120
It's a nice name.

193
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:43,000
Robin Day's got a hedgehog
called Frank.

194
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,560
Now, Frank--

00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,920

00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:54,760

200
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:57,000
Tell us about your latest film,
if you'll be so kind,
Sir Edward.

201
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:02,320
None of this "pussycat"
nonsense?

202
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:04,040
Promise.
Please, Sir Edward.

203
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:08,200
My latest film?

204
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,160
Yes, Sir Edward.

205
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:14,840
Well, the idea,
funnily enough,
came from an idea I had

206
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,720
when I first joined
the industry in 1919.

207
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:21,280
Of course, in those days
I was only a tea boy.

208
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:23,720
Oh, shut up.

Now, later in the program,
we will bring you

00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:32,520
a unique event in
the world of modern art.

212
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:35,600
Pablo Picasso will be doing
a special painting for us,

213
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:39,120
on this program, live,
on a bicycle.

214
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:40,920
This is the first time
that Picasso

215
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:43,120
has painted while cycling.

216
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:44,640

it's time to look at a man

220
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,200
Last week,
the Royal Festival Hall

221
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,600
saw the first performance
of a new symphony

222
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:05,560
by one of the world's leading
modern composers:

223
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:09,280
Arthur "Two Sheds" Jackson.
Mr. Jackson--

224
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:11,000
Good evening.

225
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,680
May I just, uh, sidetrack you
for one moment, Mr. Jackson?

226
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:16,480
This-- Uh, what shall I call it,
nickname of yours.

227
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:18,280
-Oh, yes. Ahem.
-"Two Sheds."

228
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,120
-Yes.
-How did you come by it?

229
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,280
Well, I-I don't
use it myself.

230
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,680
It's just a few of my friends
call me "Two Sheds."

231
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:28,760
I see. And do you,
in fact, have two sheds?

232
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:32,840
No. No, I have only one shed.
I've had one for some time.

233
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:36,360
But a few years ago,
I said I was thinking
of getting another one,

234
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:39,840
and since then, some people
have called me "Two Sheds."

235
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:41,760
In spite of the fact
that you have only one?

236
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:43,680
-Yes. Ahem.
-I see.

237
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:46,640
And are you thinking
of purchasing a second shed?

238
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:47,800
No.

239
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,160
To bring you in line
with your epithet?

240
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,040
-No.
-I see, I see.

241
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:53,320
Well, let's return
to your symphony. Uh...

242
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:56,560
Now then, did you write
this symphony in the shed?

243
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:58,600
No.

244
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:00,000
Have you written

245
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:01,440
any of your
recent works in this
shed of yours?

246
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:05,600
No. It's just a perfectly
ordinary garden shed.

247
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:07,440
I see.

248
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:10,920
And you're thinking of buying
this second shed to write in.

249
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:12,760
No, no. Look.
This shed business,

250
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,160
it doesn't really matter
at all.

251
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,920
The sheds aren't important.

252
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:18,240
It's just a few friends
call me "Two Sheds,"

253
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:20,160
and that's all
there is to it.

254
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:22,720
I wish you'd ask me about
me music. I'm a composer.

255
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:24,440
People are always asking
about the sheds.

256
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,320
They've got it out
of proportion.

257
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:28,320
I'm fed up with the shed.
I wish I'd never got it.

258
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:31,000
I expect you're probably
thinking of selling one.

259
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,680
I will sell one.

They don't matter.

00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,600
Mr. Jackson,
I think, with respect,

263
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:40,200
we ought to talk
about your symphony.

00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,440
What?

265
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:43,120
Apparently,
your symphony
was written

266
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:44,400
for organ and tympani.

267
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:45,520
-What's that?
-What's what?

268
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:47,720
It's a shed. Get it off.

269
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:55,000
All right. Right.

00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,760
Uh, now then, Mr. Jackson,

00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:00,520
I understand that you--

272
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,840
that you used to be interested
in trainspotting.

00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,560
What?

274
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,760
I understand, uh,
that about 30 years ago,

275
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,920
you were extremely interested
in trainspotting.

276
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:11,280
What's that got to do
with my bloody music?

-Yes, a little.

And now for more news
of the momentous
artistic event

289
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:45,800
when Pablo Picasso
is doing a specially
commissioned painting for us

290
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:47,800
whilst riding a bicycle.

291
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:50,320
Pablo Picasso,
the founder of modern art,

292
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:53,200
without doubt, the greatest
abstract painter ever,

293
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:56,280
for the first time,
painting in motion.

294
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:59,320
But first, let's have a look
at the route he'll be taking.

295
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,560
Well, uh, Picasso will
be starting, David,

296
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:04,080
at Chichester here.

297
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:07,360
He'll then cycle
on the A29 to Fontwell.

298
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:09,640
He'll then take the A272,

299
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,280
which will bring him
onto the A3,

300
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:14,040
just north of Hindhead here.

301
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:16,800
From then on, Pablo has
a straight run on the A3

302
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:20,160
until he meets the South
Circular at Battersea here.

303
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:22,160
Well, this is
a truly remarkable occasion,

304
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:24,440
as it is the first time
that a modern artist

305
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:28,600
of such stature
has taken the A272.

306
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:31,480
And it'll be very interesting
to see how he copes

307
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:34,400
with the heavy traffic
round Wisborough Green. Vicky.

308
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:37,480
Well, Picasso will be riding
his Viking Super Roadster,

309
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:40,040
with the drop handlebars
and the dual-thread wheel rims.

310
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:42,160
And with his Wiley-Prat
20-1 synchro-mesh,

311
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:44,240
he should experience
difficulties

312
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:47,600
on the sort of road surfaces
they just don't get
abroad. Mitzie.

313
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:50,000
And now for the latest report
on Picasso's progress,

314
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:52,480
over to Reg Moss
on the Guildford bypass.

315
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:54,760
Well, there's no
sign of Picasso at
the moment, David,

316
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,760
but he should be through
here at any moment.

317
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:59,360
However, I do have with me
Mr. Ron Geppo,

318
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:01,120
British cycling
sprint champion

319
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:03,760
and this year's winner
of the Derby-Doncaster rally.

320
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:06,000
Uh, well, Reg, I think
Pablo should be all right,

321
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:08,280
provided he doesn't
attempt anything
on the monumental scale

322
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,920
of some of
his earlier paintings,

323
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:12,280
like, uh,<i> Guernica</i>
or<i> Les Demoiselles d'Avignon,</i>

324
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:15,760
or even his later<i> War and Peace</i>
mural for the Temple of Peace
chapel at Vallauris.

325
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:17,560
Because with this
strong head-wind

326
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,000
I don't think even
Doug Timpson of
Manchester Harriers

327
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:22,280
could paint anything
on that kind of scale.

328
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,000
Well,
thank you, Ron.

329
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:26,360
Well, there still seems to be
no sign of Picasso

330
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,400
so I'll hand you back
to the studio.

331
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:30,640
Well, we've just heard
that Picasso is approaching

332
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:32,440
the Tolworth roundabout
on the A3,

333
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,920
so come in,
Sam Trench at Tolworth.

334
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:37,800
Well, something certainly
is happening here at
Tolworth roundabout.

335
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:40,880
David, I can now see Picasso.
He's cycling down towards
the roundabout,

336
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:43,520
he's about 75, 50 yards away
and I can now see his painting.

337
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:44,800
It's an abstract.

338
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:46,240
I can see some blue,
some purple.

339
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:48,000
Uh, some little,
black oval shapes.

340
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:49,640
I think I can see--

341
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,960
