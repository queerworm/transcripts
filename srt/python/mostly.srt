72

it was only a hole
in the ground,

tarpaulin, but it was
a house to us.

clean the newspaper,

85
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,600

92
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:37,840

work 19 hours at mill
for a shilling a year,

94

and when we got home, our dad

95
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:46,000
would flog us to sleep
with a cat-o'-nine-tails

-What is?
-The Disciples.

335
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:21,680
Are they too Jewish?

336
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:24,880
I made Judas the most Jewish.

337
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:27,120
No, it's just that
there are 28 of them.

338
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:31,080
-Too many?
-Well, of course
it's too many.

339
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:32,840
Yeah, I know, but I wanted
to give the impression

340
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,720
of a real Last Supper,
you know

341
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:38,240
not just like a last snack
or a final meal.

342
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:41,800
But a real mother
of a Last Supper.

343
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:46,000
There were only 12 Disciples
at the Last Supper.

344
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:47,760
Well, maybe, some
of their friends dropped by

345
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:49,000
after dinner for a drink.

346
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:50,400
No friends.

347
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:52,000
-Waiters?
-No waiters.

348
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:53,880
-Cabaret.
-No cabaret.

349
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:56,920
You see, I like the crowd,
it helps to flesh out
the scene.

350
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:59,200
I could lose a few, I suppose.

351
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:01,600
Look, there were only
12 Disciples...

352
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:03,400
I've got it.

353
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:06,080
We'll call it,
The Last But One Supper.

354
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:07,400
What?

355
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,040
Well, if there was a last one,

356
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:10,880
there must have been
a one before that.

357
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:14,600
So, this will be
the Penultimate Supper.

358
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:15,840
The Bible doesn't say

359
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:17,240
how many people were
there now, does it?

360
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:18,920
-No, no.
-Well, there you are, then.

361
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,600
Well, look, look,

362
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:21,960
The Last Supper

363
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,120
was a significant event
in the life of our Lord.

364
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:25,880
The Penultimate Supper
was not,

365
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:28,400
even if they had
a mariachi band
and a conjurer.

366
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:31,600
Now, I commissioned
a Last Supper from you,

367
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:35,080
and a Last Supper I want,
with 12 Disciples,

368
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:37,360
and one Christ!

369
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:40,120
One?

370
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:41,960
Yes, one!

371
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,720
Now, will you tell me
what in God's name

372
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:47,200
possessed you to paint this
with three Christs in it?

373
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:50,080
-It works, mate.
-Works?

374
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:51,520
Yeah, it looks great.

375
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:54,280
The fat one
balances the two skinny ones.

376
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:56,320
There was only one redeemer!

377
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:58,520
I know that,
we all know that.

378
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:00,040
I want one...

379
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:01,520
But what about a bit
of artistic license?

380
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:03,640
I want one Messiah.

381
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,880
I'll tell you what you want,
you want a bloody
photographer,

382
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:07,360
that's what you
bloody well want.

383
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:09,000
Not an artistic creator.

384
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:10,440
I'll tell you what I want.

385
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:14,040
I want a Last Supper
with 12 Disciples, one Christ,

386
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:16,520
no steel bands,
no trampoline acts,

387
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:21,960
no kangaroos,
by Thursday lunch,
or you don't get paid.

388
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,360
Bloody fascist.

389
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:27,920
Look, I'm the head of the
fucking Catholic Church, I am,

390
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:29,440
so, watch it.

391
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:36,080
You know what
makes that special?

392
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:37,120

(ORCHESTRA CONTINUES PLAYING)

455
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:16,320
Bloody Catholics.

456
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:18,360
Filling up the bloody world
with bloody people,

457
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:21,400
they can't afford
to bloody feed.
(INHALES SHARPLY)

458
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:23,000
What are we, dear?

459
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:26,600
Protestant
and fiercely proud of it.

460
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:29,120
Why do they have
so many children?

461
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:32,280
Because every time
they have sexual intercourse,

462
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:34,320
they have to have a baby.

463
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:37,080
But it's the same
with us, Harry.

464
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:38,160
What do you mean?

465
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:40,560
Well, we've got two children,

466
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:43,560
and we've had
sexual intercourse twice.

467
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:45,200
Ah.

468
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:48,840
That's not the point,
we can have it whenever
we want.

469
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:51,000
-Really?
-Oh, yeah.

470
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:53,400
Because we don't believe
in all that papist clap trap,

471
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,280
we can take precautions.

472
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:58,080
What, you mean lock the door?

473
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:02,120
No. I mean as members of
the Protestant Reformed
Church,

474
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:03,360
that successfully challenged

475
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:05,480
the autocratic power
of the papacy

476
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:08,280
in the early part
of the 16th century,

477
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:10,080
we can wear little
rubber devices

478
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:11,320
to prevent issue.

479
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:13,080
What do you mean?

480
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:14,160
I could, if I wanted,

481
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:16,080
have sexual intercourse
with you.

482
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:17,560
Oh, yes, Harry.

483
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:20,920
And thanks to Martin Luther
and his friends,

484
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,840
I could wear a sheath.

485
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:25,400
-What, a dress?
-No, no.

486
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:27,680
A rubber sheath
over my own fella

487
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:30,600
to ensure that
when I came off,

488
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,760
-you would not be impregnated.
-Ooh!

489
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:35,800
Oh, yes, that's what being
a Protestant's all about.

490
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:40,160
It doesn't stop
with a simple condom, no.

491
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:43,160
I could wear French ticklers.

492
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,200
You what?

493
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:46,200
French ticklers,
crocodile ribs,

494
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:49,160
black mambos,
wafer thin condoms.

495
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:52,320
Designed not only to protect,

496
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:55,520
but enhance the stimulation
of sexual congress.

497
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:57,240
Have you got one?

498
00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:00,040
Have I got one?

499
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:01,520
Well, no.

500
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:03,160
But I could go
down the road any time

501
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:05,440
and walk into Boots
with my head held high,

502
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:10,040
and say, "Mr Boot,
I want you to sell me
a condom.

503
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:15,040
In fact, I think
I'll have a Mexican tickler.

504
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:17,160
For, I am a Protestant,

505
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:21,240
and that is best thing
to be because that is
what God wants."

506
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:28,960
You people really piss me off!

507
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:33,160
I'm sorry I invented you.
It was a really bad idea.

508
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,840
Sex, sex, sex,

509
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:37,520
that's all you bloody humans
think about.

510
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:40,240
That, and trying to blow smoke
up my arse

511
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:42,160
with endless prayers.

512
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:44,000
It's so boring.

513
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:48,040
Now, this is supposed to be
a funny show, so, for my sake,

514
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:49,520
get on with it.

515
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:56,040
ANNOUNCER:
<i>And, welcome to Munich</i>
<i>for the 27th City Olympiad,</i>

516
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:59,080
<i>an event held traditionally</i>
<i>every 3.7 years,</i>

517
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:01,080
<i>which, this year,</i>
<i>has brought</i>
<i>together competitors</i>

518
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,680
<i>from over four million</i>
<i>different countries.</i>

519
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:05,160
<i>And here we are at the start</i>

520
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,680
<i>of the first event</i>
<i>of the afternoon,</i>

521
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:08,160
<i>the second semi-final</i>
<i>of the 100 yards</i>

522
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:10,280
<i>for people with no sense</i>
<i>of direction.</i>

523
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:12,200
<i>Now, I'll just give you</i>
<i>the competitors.</i>

524
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:14,000
<i>Lane one, Kolomovski of Poland</i>
<i>Lane two, Zatapatique</i>
<i>of France.</i>

525
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:16,240
<i>Lane three, Gropovich</i>
<i>of the United States.</i>

526
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:17,760
<i>Next to him,</i>
<i>Drabble of Trinidad.</i>

527
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:19,320
<i>Next to him,</i>
<i>Fernandez of Spain,</i>

528
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:22,200
<i>and in the outside lane,</i>
<i>Bormann of Brazil.</i>

529
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:23,360
(GUNSHOT)

530
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:27,160
<i>And now, over to the swimming.</i>

531
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:29,000
<i>And you join us here</i>
<i>at the Bundesabsurd pool,</i>

532
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:30,880
<i>just in time to see the start</i>

533
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:32,600
<i>of the 200 meters freestyle</i>
<i>for non-swimmers.</i>

534
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,480
<i>Watch for the tough</i>
<i>Australian champion,</i>

535
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:36,640
<i>Ron Barnett in</i>
<i>the second lane.</i>

536
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:39,120
(BLOWS WHISTLE)

537
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:46,760
<i>Well, we'll be bringing you</i>
<i>back here</i>

538
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:48,600
<i>the moment they start</i>
<i>fishing the corpses out,</i>

539
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,480
<i>but now over to Hans Clay</i>
<i>for the start of the marathon</i>

540
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:52,280
<i>for incontinence.</i>

541
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:54,240
<i>Well, we've got an enormous</i>
<i>entry for this event.</i>

542
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:57,160
<i>Forty-four competitors</i>
<i>from 29 different countries,</i>

543
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:59,960
<i>all of them with</i>
<i>the most superbly</i>
<i>weak bladders.</i>

544
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
<i>Not a tight</i>
<i>sphincter in sight.</i>

545
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:05,040
<i>Ready to embark, nevertheless,</i>
<i>on the world's longest race,</i>

546
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:07,120
<i>and they're just aching to go.</i>

547
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:10,040
<i>On your marks! Get set!</i>

548
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:11,320
(GUNSHOT)

549
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:12,840
<i>And they're off, they're off.</i>

550
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:17,280
<i>And now, the high jump.</i>

551
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:19,400
<i>Katerina Ovelenskij</i>
<i>for the Soviet Union.</i>

552
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:21,480
<i>But what a jump! What a jump!</i>

553
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:24,000
<i>That will probably</i>
<i>be a record!</i>

554
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:26,920
<i>And here we are</i>
<i>at the 3,000 meter</i>
<i>steeple chase</i>

555
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:28,520
<i>for people who think</i>
<i>they're chickens.</i>

556
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:30,240
<i>There's Samuelsson</i>
<i>of the United States</i>

557
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:32,520
<i>and over there,</i>
<i>is Klaus of East Germany.</i>

558
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:34,560
<i>He's been</i>
<i>a Rhode Island Red now</i>
<i>for the last three Olympics.</i>

559
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:36,600
<i>And there's the referee</i>
<i>trying to get them going...</i>

560
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:37,840
<i>Where is the leader?</i>

561
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:40,040
<i>Abe Seagull of Canada,</i>
<i>he went off,</i>

562
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:42,280
<i>got a very good start</i>
<i>and then settled down</i>
<i>on the water jump,</i>

563
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:43,920
<i>and has now gone loopy.</i>

564
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:45,080
<i>Now, we're back</i>
<i>with the marathon</i>

565
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:46,480
<i>for incontinence once again.</i>

566
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:48,080
<i>There's Polinski</i>
<i>of Poland in the lead,</i>

567
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:50,280
<i>and now, Brewer</i>
<i>of Australia has taken over.</i>

568
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:53,240
<i>Brewer has overtaken him,</i>
<i>but he's gone</i>
<i>to spend a penny.</i>

569
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:54,720
<i>There goes Burt</i>
<i>to spend a penny</i>

570
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:56,160
<i>and there goes</i>
<i>Gurdich of Austria,</i>

571
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:57,760
<i>and so now it's</i>
<i>Alvarez of Cuba,</i>

572
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:59,840
<i>followed by the plucky</i>
<i>Norwegian, Borg.</i>

573
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:02,320
<i>They're in and out</i>
<i>like yo-yos, boys!</i>
<i>And there's MacDonald!</i>

574
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:04,040
<i>MacDonald is coming back,</i>
<i>but he can't hold...</i>
<i>Here's Immacuvich.</i>

575
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:06,200
<i>Immacuvich of Yugoslavia</i>
<i>is taking...</i>

576
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:07,840
<i>And he can't hold it either.</i>

577
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:09,840
<i>Well, well, these must be some</i>
<i>of the weakest bladders</i>

578
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:11,560
<i>ever to represent</i>
<i>their countries.</i>

579
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:13,080
<i>And now,</i>
<i>let's have a look back</i>

580
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:14,440
<i>at what's going on</i>
<i>down on the stage.</i>

581
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:27,280
-Ah, Mr Anchovy.
-Hello.

582
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:28,760
-Do sit down.
-Thank you.

583
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:31,320
-Take the weight off the feet?
-Yes, yes, yes.

584
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:33,440
Lovely weather
for the time of year?

585
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:36,120
Enough of this gay banter.

586
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:38,840
Now, Mr Anchovy,
you asked us to advise you

587
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:43,680
what was the best job in life,
as your profession.

588
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:45,600
-That is correct.
-Right.

589
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:47,440
Now, I have the results here
of the interviews,

590
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:49,680
the aptitude test
that you did last week

591
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:51,160
and I think we've managed
to build up

592
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:53,160
a pretty clear picture

593
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:54,680
of the sort of person you are.

594
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:56,640
I think I can say without fear
of contradiction

595
00:33:56,680 --> 00:34:00,480
that the ideal job for you
is chartered accountancy.

596
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:04,120
But I am a
chartered accountant.

597
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:05,680
Good for you.

598
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:07,520
Well, back to the office,
then. Well done.

599
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:09,160
No, you don't understand.

600
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:10,840
I've been
a chartered accountant
for 20 years.

601
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:12,560
I want a new job.

602
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:15,960
Something exciting
that will let me live.

603
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,000
Accountancy is quite exciting,
isn't it?

604
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:21,400
Exciting? No, it's not.

605
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:24,080
It's dull, dull, dull.

606
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:25,720
My God, it's dull.

607
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:27,440
It's deadly dull,

608
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:31,040
and tedious
and boring and stuffy

609
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:32,600
and desperately dull.

610
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:35,080
Ah, yes, Mr Anchovy,
but you see, your report here

611
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:39,000
says that you are
an extremely dull fellow.

612
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:41,080
Our experts describe you

613
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:42,520
as appallingly dull,

614
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:45,760
unimaginative, timid,
lacking in initiative,

615
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:48,360
spineless, easily dominated,

616
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:51,000
no sense of humour,
tedious company

617
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:54,720
and irrepressibly drab
and awful.

618
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:57,040
And whereas,
in other professions,

619
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:59,040
these would be considerable
drawbacks,

620
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:01,600
in chartered accountancy
they're a positive boon.

621
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:05,480
But I came here to find
a new job, a new life,

622
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:08,080
a new meaning to my existence.

623
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:09,560
Can't you help me?

624
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:12,320
Well, do you have any idea
what you want to do?

625
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:13,760
-Yes, I have.
-Ah.

626
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:16,480
Lion taming.

627
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:19,400
Lion taming?

628
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:21,680
Yes, it's a bit of a jump,
isn't it?

629
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:24,520
You know,
chartered accountancy
to lion taming in one go,

630
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:26,400
you don't think it might
be better to work your way

631
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:28,200
towards lion taming?

632
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:30,240
Say, via insurance
or something like that?

633
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:31,840
-Oh, no, no.
-No?

634
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:34,160
I don't want to wait.
Nine o'clock tomorrow,

635
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:36,480
I want to be in there, taming.

636
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:40,200
(STUTTERS) Yes, but do you
have any qualifications?

637
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:41,320
I've got a hat.

638
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:43,240
-A hat?
-Yeah, a hat.

639
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:45,320
A lion tamer's hat.

640
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:47,120
A hat with "Lion Tamer"
written on it.

641
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:48,560
I bought it at Harrods.

642
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:50,040
-Ah, I see.
-Yeah, yeah.

643
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:51,440
It lights up at night saying,
"Lion Tamer"

644
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:53,000
in big red neon letters,

645
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:54,680
so you can tame
them after dark,

646
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:56,160
-when they're less stroppy.
-Yes, yes.

647
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:57,800
And during the day
you can turn it off

648
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:59,280
and claim reasonable
wear and tear

649
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:01,040
as allowable
professional expenses

650
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:03,880
-under paragraph 335 B...
-Mr Anchovy,

651
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:06,240
if I now ring up Bertram Mills
and say,

652
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:09,440
"Look, I've got a 45-year-old
chartered accountant here

653
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:11,120
who wants to become
a lion tamer,"

654
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:14,120
their first question
is not going to be,

655
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:16,360
"Does he have his own hat?"

656
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:18,360
You see, they're more likely
to ask about

657
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:20,600
your experience with lions.

658
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:23,360
(SNICKERS) Well, I've seen
them at the zoo.

659
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:25,160
Yes, well, that's a start.

660
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:27,360
Yes, small brown
furry creature,
with short stumpy legs

661
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:29,720
and great long curved noses.

662
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:30,840
I don't know
what all the fuss is about.

663
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:32,360
I could tame one of those.

664
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:33,920
They look pretty tame
to start with.

665
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:35,800
Now these,
these lions of yours,

666
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:38,040
how tall are they?

667
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:39,440
Well...

668
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:42,040
Well, about so high.
They don't frighten me.

669
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:45,040
And do they, by any chance,
eat ants?

670
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:46,640
Got it.

671
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:48,040
Well, I think what
you've got there, Mr Anchovy,

-is an anteater, not a lion.
-What?

673
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:52,480
You see, a lion
is a huge savage brute,

674
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:54,840
about five feet tall,
ten feet long,

675
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:56,240
weighing about 500 pounds.

676
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:58,040
They run 40 miles an hour

677
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:01,360
and they have huge,
very sharp pointed teeth,

678
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:04,200
and nasty, vicious,
razor-sharp claws

679
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:05,600
that could rip your belly open

680
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:07,480
before you could say,
"Jack Robinson,"

681
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:09,080
and they look like this.

682
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:11,000
(ROARING)

683
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:12,640

684
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:15,080

686
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:18,720
Um...

687
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:22,040
Actually, I quite like
your idea perhaps,

688
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:24,440
of making the transition
to lion taming

689
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:26,240
via easier stages.

690
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:29,720
-You know,
maybe via insurance.
-Or banking.

691
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:31,080
-Banking.
-Banking.

692
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:32,760
Banking.
There's a man's life.

693
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:35,520
Banking, travel,
excitement, adventure,

694
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:37,360
decisions affecting
people's lives.

695
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:39,080
So, shall I call the bank?

696
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:41,080
-Eh... Yeah.
-Yes?

697
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:42,600
No, no, no. No, look...

698
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:44,440
Just give me a couple of weeks
to think about it,

699
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:46,400
because it's a big,
it is a big decision.

700
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:48,080
-Maybe, I'll just...
-Yes, yes, yes.

701
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:49,720
-Or maybe three weeks.
-Give it a month.

702
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:51,040
-A month. Yeah.
-Give it a month.

703
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:52,400
-Well...
-Um...

704
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:55,440
Can I tell you something?

705
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:58,120
Yes?

706
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:00,720
I never really wanted
to be a lion tamer.

707
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:08,120
I wanted to be...

708
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:09,320
A systems analyst.

709
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:11,240
Systems...

710
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:14,360
And then I got this postcard
from my aunt in Canada

711
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:15,960
and it looked wonderful.

712
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,080
I realized the one thing
I wanted was to be
a lumberjack.

713
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:26,000
Leaping from tree to tree

714

the mighty rivers

715
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:28,640
of British Columbia.

716
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:30,640
The giant redwood.

717
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:32,760
The larch.

718
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:35,440
The mighty Scots pine.

<i>Socrates.</i>

841
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:47,120
<i>Socrates there, going through.</i>

842
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:49,520
<i>There's the ball.</i>
<i>There's the ball.</i>

843
00:44:49,560 --> 00:44:51,400
<i>And Nietzsche there.</i>
<i>Nietzsche...</i>

844
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:53,480
<i>Number 10 in this German side.</i>

845
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:57,000
<i>Kant moving up on the outside.</i>

846
00:44:57,040 --> 00:44:58,880
<i>Schlegel's on the left.</i>

847
00:44:58,920 --> 00:45:00,840
<i>The Germans moving very well</i>
<i>in these opening moments.</i>

848
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:02,200
<i>Well, there you are.</i>

849
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:03,240

850
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:04,640

851
00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:06,520
<i>but right now it's time for...</i>

852
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:07,680
MAN:<i> Philosophy.</i>

853
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:11,480
Hello there. How you doing?

854
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:15,320
How are you? How you doing?

855
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:18,160
ALL: G'day, Bruce.

856
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:20,040
G'day, ladies and Bruce's.

857
00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:23,240
It's very nice to be here
in the Oz arena.

858
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:25,160
O2, mate. It's a two.

859
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:26,720
I'm sorry, mate.
Thank you very much.

860
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:28,000
-So patriotic.
-Sorry.

861
00:45:28,040 --> 00:45:30,080
We're all philosophy
professors

862
00:45:30,120 --> 00:45:32,920
from the University
of Woolamaloo, Australia.

863
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:36,120
ALL: Australia, Australia,
Australia.

864
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:37,520
We love you.

865
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:39,920
I teach Hegelian philosophy.

866
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:42,560
Bruce here teaches
Aristotelian philosophy.

867
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:45,280
And Bruce here teaches
classical philosophy

868
00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:49,120
and all of these
other Bruce's are in charge
of the sheep dip.

869
00:45:49,160 --> 00:45:52,240
ALL: Sheep, sheep, sheep,
we love you.

870
00:45:52,280 --> 00:45:53,400
This is the wattle,

871
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:55,120
the emblem of our land.

872
00:45:55,160 --> 00:45:57,000
You can stick it in a bottle,

873
00:45:57,040 --> 00:45:58,600
you can hold it in your hand.

874
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:00,400
-Amen.
-Amen, amen.

875
00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:02,240
Bloody thirsty work this,
Bruce, I think I'll get...

876
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:03,760
Why don't you have
a chilly then, mate.

877
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:05,160
In fact,
they look a bit thirsty.

878
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:06,960
They look like
they could use a drink.

879
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:08,640
Throw them a drink
out there, mate.

880
00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:10,200
-Throw them some of...
-Are you thirsty?

881
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:11,080
-Good old Australian beer.
-Who's going to...

882
00:46:11,120 --> 00:46:12,400
Throw them out, yeah.

883
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:14,520
Chuck them, mate.
Chuck them. Good, there.

884
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:17,480
Now the reason we do this,
ladies and Bruce's,

885
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:19,360
is we find over here,

886
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:21,000
your English beer

887
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:23,560
is a little like
making love in a canoe.

888
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:24,840
How's that at?

889
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:27,160
It's fucking close to water.

890
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:28,040
I love it!

891
00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:30,240
Oh.

892
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:32,640
-Good evening.
-Good evening, dickhead.

893
00:46:32,680 --> 00:46:34,720
-How are you, Punk Bruce?
-I'm good.

894
00:46:34,760 --> 00:46:37,400
Now Punk Bruce here
has brought on Guest Bruce,

895
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:39,440
who tonight
has agreed to dress

896
00:46:39,480 --> 00:46:41,400
like a prat for charity.

897
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:42,560
All right.

898
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:44,440
So what's your name, Bruce?

899
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:46,640
My name is Roger.

900
00:46:46,680 --> 00:46:48,120
-Roger?
-Roger McGough.

901
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:50,240
You're fucking Eddie Izzard,
aren't you?

902
00:46:50,280 --> 00:46:53,040
I fuck him on Tuesdays
and Wednesdays.

903
00:46:53,080 --> 00:46:54,440
(ALL CHEERING)

904
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:02,040
Yeah, he's in
disguise tonight.

905
00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:04,240
And what's your
charity, Bruce?

906
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:07,040
My charity, Bruce,
I'm raising money,

907
00:47:07,080 --> 00:47:08,360
or I've been giving money

908
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:10,680
to the Monty Python
Retirement Fund.

909
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:13,160
-Yeah.
-Excellent. Right...
Thank you.

910
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:14,360
And so for...

911
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:16,160
'Roo Bruce, leave him alone.

912
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:17,920
You randy little kanga.

913
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:19,600
-It's all right.
-Sorry about that, Bruce.

914
00:47:19,640 --> 00:47:21,160
Have you got
another monologue or...

915
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:23,120
No, no, I'll just say
I've paid 40 million

916
00:47:23,160 --> 00:47:25,240
Australian dollars
to do this, so...

917
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:27,160
-Okay, very nice indeed.
-Check's in the post.

918
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:28,480
Thank you, Bruce.

919
00:47:28,520 --> 00:47:30,520
Right, I'm sorry
about our marsupials,

920
00:47:30,560 --> 00:47:32,200
they shag worse
than a bloody carpet,

921
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:33,840
-some of them.
-(BRUCE LAUGHS)

922
00:47:33,880 --> 00:47:36,640
Anyway, let's try
and raise the chain a little

923
00:47:36,680 --> 00:47:38,760
by singing
a little intellectual song.

924
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:40,720
-Are you ready?

smoke daffodils, mate.

No, what happened?

give us a bit of a hand

952
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:48,280
and we'll sing along
to this one, right?

They're in my pocket.

-Let's raise the tone.
-Now, have we got anything.

982
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:52,360
Punk Bruce,
can you give us a hand?

983
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:54,000
I can give her a hand here.

984
00:49:54,040 --> 00:49:55,360
Oh, oi, oi!

985
00:49:55,400 --> 00:49:57,120
Stop that, Bruce. You, oi!

986
00:49:57,160 --> 00:49:58,520
Straight off. Off.

987
00:49:58,560 --> 00:50:00,840
-Oh, go on, fuck off.
-Get off her, mate.

988
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:04,000
Bugger off to Barcelona
and bite Luis Suarez.

989
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:06,880
Now, Punk Bruce,

990
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:09,160
have you got anything
to help us put the words up

991
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:10,680
for these poor people?

992
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:13,440
-How's that, Bruce?
-Oh, yeah.

01:08:57,400 --> 01:08:58,840
Oh!

1343
01:08:58,880 --> 01:09:01,320
We'll have to watch
the telly then.

1344
01:09:01,360 --> 01:09:03,200
Yes, we will.

1345
01:09:03,240 --> 01:09:04,920
What's on the television?

1346
01:09:09,280 --> 01:09:10,840
Looks like a penguin.

1347
01:09:13,040 --> 01:09:16,640
No, I didn't mean
what's on the television set,

1348
01:09:16,680 --> 01:09:18,880
I meant what program?

1349
01:09:18,920 --> 01:09:20,280
Oh... Oh.

1350
01:09:23,440 --> 01:09:27,160
-Sort of funny, that penguin
being there, isn't it?
-Mmm.

1351
01:09:27,200 --> 01:09:28,320
What's it doing?

1352
01:09:28,360 --> 01:09:29,440
Standing.

1353
01:09:29,480 --> 01:09:31,240
I can see that!

1354
01:09:32,080 --> 01:09:34,000
If it lays an egg,

1355
01:09:34,040 --> 01:09:37,000
it'll fall down the back
of the television set.

1356
01:09:38,520 --> 01:09:40,600
We'll have to watch that.

1357
01:09:41,760 --> 01:09:43,360
Unless it's male.

1358
01:09:43,400 --> 01:09:45,000
Oh, I never thought of that.

1359
01:09:45,040 --> 01:09:46,440
It looks fairly butch.

1360
01:09:48,880 --> 01:09:50,800
Perhaps it's from next door.

1361
01:09:50,840 --> 01:09:54,240
Penguins don't come
from next door.

1362
01:09:54,280 --> 01:09:56,560
They come from the Antarctic.

1363
01:09:57,280 --> 01:09:58,840
Burma!

1364
01:10:03,320 --> 01:10:05,240
Why did you say Burma?

1365
01:10:05,280 --> 01:10:07,760
-Oh, I panicked.
-Oh!

1366
01:10:15,520 --> 01:10:17,280
Perhaps it's from the zoo.

1367
01:10:17,320 --> 01:10:18,840
Which zoo?

1368
01:10:18,880 --> 01:10:20,600
How would I know
which bloody zoo?

1369
01:10:20,640 --> 01:10:24,320
I'm not David
bloody Attenborough!

1370
01:10:24,360 --> 01:10:26,440
How does David
bloody Attenborough

1371
01:10:26,480 --> 01:10:28,160
know which zoo it came from?

1372
01:10:28,200 --> 01:10:30,040
He knows everything.

1373
01:10:30,080 --> 01:10:31,320
Oh.

1374
01:10:31,360 --> 01:10:32,880
I wouldn't like that.

1375
01:10:32,920 --> 01:10:35,440
It would take all the mystery
out of life.

1376
01:10:37,160 --> 01:10:39,080
Anyway,
if it came from the zoo,

1377
01:10:39,120 --> 01:10:42,120
it would have
"Property of the zoo"
stamped on it.

1378
01:10:42,160 --> 01:10:43,720
No, it wouldn't.

1379
01:10:43,760 --> 01:10:47,120
They don't stamp animals
"Property of the zoo."

1380
01:10:47,160 --> 01:10:51,320
You can't stamp
a huge Siberian tiger,

1381
01:10:51,360 --> 01:10:54,000
"Property of the zoo."

1382
01:10:54,040 --> 01:10:56,360
They stamp them
when they're small.

1383
01:11:05,080 --> 01:11:06,880
What happens when they molt?

1384
01:11:08,400 --> 01:11:10,680
Siberian tigers don't molt.

1385
01:11:10,720 --> 01:11:12,520
No, but penguins do!

2070
01:46:36,200 --> 01:46:40,040
Good afternoon, sir.
Have you come for an argument?

2071
01:46:40,080 --> 01:46:41,000
Um...

2072
01:46:44,800 --> 01:46:46,400
Or would you like a blow job?

2073
01:46:48,520 --> 01:46:49,600
Pardon?

2074
01:46:49,640 --> 01:46:51,400
Ah, you've come
for an argument.

2075
01:46:51,440 --> 01:46:53,200
-(CHUCKLES)
-What was the other option?

2076
01:46:53,240 --> 01:46:56,040
-Oh, nothing... Nothing.
-Oh.

2077
01:46:56,080 --> 01:46:58,760
-It's just a special offer.
-Oh.

2078
01:46:58,800 --> 01:47:00,960
So have you been here before?

2079
01:47:01,000 --> 01:47:03,160
No, this is my first time.

2080
01:47:03,200 --> 01:47:05,880
-(CLEARS THROAT)
-I see. Well would you like
to have just one argument?

2081
01:47:05,920 --> 01:47:07,600
Or were you thinking
of taking a course?

2082
01:47:07,640 --> 01:47:09,160
Well, what is the cost?

2083
01:47:09,200 --> 01:47:11,160
It's one pound
for a five-minute argument,

2084
01:47:11,200 --> 01:47:13,600
but only eight pounds
for a course of ten.

2085
01:47:13,640 --> 01:47:15,040
Well, I think I'll take
the five minutes

2086
01:47:15,080 --> 01:47:16,280
and see how it goes
from there.

2087
01:47:16,320 --> 01:47:18,560
-Fine. Let's see.

2089
01:47:21,480 --> 01:47:22,880
Thank you. Thank you.

01:47:27,960 --> 01:47:30,080
-What do you want?
-Well I... I...

2092
01:47:30,120 --> 01:47:31,480
And don't give me that,

2093

of parrot droppings.

for an argument.

Oh, I'm sorry, this is abuse.

01:47:46,080 --> 01:47:47,040
Oh.

2100
01:47:48,080 --> 01:47:49,760
Oh, you want next door.

2101
01:47:49,800 --> 01:47:52,200
Oh, I see. Thank you.

2102
01:47:52,240 --> 01:47:54,000
Not at all.

2104
01:47:58,080 --> 01:48:00,840
Hello. Is this the right room
for an argument?

2105
01:48:00,880 --> 01:48:02,920
I've told you once...

2106
01:48:02,960 --> 01:48:04,760
-No, you haven't.
-Yes, I have.

2107
01:48:04,800 --> 01:48:06,480
-When?
-Just now.

2108
01:48:06,520 --> 01:48:08,080
-No, you didn't. You didn't.
-Yes, I did.

2109
01:48:08,120 --> 01:48:09,680
-Yes, I did. Yes, I did.
-You didn't. You didn't.

2110
01:48:09,720 --> 01:48:12,400
Oh, I'm sorry. Is this
the five-minute argument

2111
01:48:12,440 --> 01:48:14,520
or the full half-hour?

2112
01:48:14,560 --> 01:48:15,760
-Oh, just the five minutes.
(CLEARS THROAT)
-Just the five minutes.

2113
01:48:15,800 --> 01:48:17,720
Thank you very much.
Anyway I did.

2114
01:48:17,760 --> 01:48:19,240
You most certainly did not.

2115
01:48:19,280 --> 01:48:20,680
Now, let's get one thing
absolutely clear.

2116
01:48:20,720 --> 01:48:22,000
I most definitely told you.

2117
01:48:22,040 --> 01:48:23,480
-No, you didn't.
-Yes, I did.

2118
01:48:23,520 --> 01:48:24,840
-No, you didn't.
-Yes, I did.

2119
01:48:24,880 --> 01:48:26,000
-No, you didn't.
-Yes, I did.

2120
01:48:26,040 --> 01:48:27,560
-No, you didn't.
-Yes, I did.

2121
01:48:27,600 --> 01:48:28,920
-No, you didn't.
-Yes, I did.

2122
01:48:28,960 --> 01:48:30,080
-No, you didn't.
-Yes, I did.

2123
01:48:30,120 --> 01:48:31,640
-No, you didn't.
-Yes, I did.

2124
01:48:31,680 --> 01:48:33,120
-No, you didn't.
-Yes, I did.

2125
01:48:33,160 --> 01:48:34,440
No, you didn't.
Look, this isn't an argument.

2126
01:48:34,480 --> 01:48:36,480
-Yes, it is.
-No, it isn't.

2127
01:48:38,640 --> 01:48:40,080
-Just contradiction.
-No, it isn't.

2128
01:48:40,120 --> 01:48:41,720
You contradicted me just then.
You did...

2129
01:48:41,760 --> 01:48:43,080
I did not.

2130
01:48:43,120 --> 01:48:45,880
Never. No, no, no, no, no.
(SCOFFS)

2131
01:48:46,600 --> 01:48:48,360
This is futile.

2132
01:48:48,400 --> 01:48:49,440
No, it isn't.

2133
01:48:49,480 --> 01:48:51,520
Yes, it is.

2134
01:48:51,560 --> 01:48:52,600
I came here for
a good argument.

2135
01:48:52,640 --> 01:48:53,680
No, you didn't.

2136
01:48:53,720 --> 01:48:55,200
You came here for an argument.

2137
01:48:55,240 --> 01:48:56,720
But an argument
isn't just contradiction.

2138
01:48:56,760 --> 01:48:58,040
-Yes, it is.
-No, it isn't.

2139
01:48:58,080 --> 01:49:00,560
An argument is a connected
series of statements

2140
01:49:00,600 --> 01:49:02,680
intended to establish
a proposition.

2141
01:49:02,720 --> 01:49:04,160
Look, if I argue with you,

2142
01:49:04,200 --> 01:49:06,360
I must take up
a contrary position.

2143
01:49:06,400 --> 01:49:07,640
Yes, but that's
not just saying,

2144
01:49:07,680 --> 01:49:08,960
-"No, it isn't."
-Yes, it is.

2145
01:49:09,000 --> 01:49:10,840
-No, it isn't.
-Yes, it is.

2146
01:49:10,880 --> 01:49:12,760
-No, it isn't, no, it isn't.
-Yes, yes, yes, yes, it is.

2147
01:49:12,800 --> 01:49:14,280
-No, it isn't, no, it isn't.
-Yes, yes, yes, yes, it is.

2148
01:49:14,320 --> 01:49:15,880
Argument
is an intellectual process.

2149
01:49:15,920 --> 01:49:18,520
Contradiction is just
the automatic gainsaying

2150
01:49:18,560 --> 01:49:20,400
of anything
the other person says.

2151
01:49:20,440 --> 01:49:21,560
-It is not.
-It is.

2152
01:49:21,600 --> 01:49:23,040
-Not at all.
-Now, look, I...

That's it.

2156

-I'm afraid it was.
-No, it wasn't.
