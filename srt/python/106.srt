[WHIMPERS, STAMMERS]

514
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:13,920
"Splunge."

515
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:16,960
That's the stupidest idea
I ever heard! Get out!

516
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,920
Doris Dog kisses Rock Tree
and she says?

517
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:23,160
I can't take it anymore!

518
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:26,640
I like that! I like that,
"I can't take it anymore."

519
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:30,400
And then Rock Hudson says:
"I'm a very rich film producer
and I need a lobotomy."

520
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:32,840
And then Doris Dog says:
"I think you're very handsome

521
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,520
and I'm gonna
take all my clothes off."

522
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:36,400
And then Doris Dog
turns into a yak

523
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:38,360
and goes to the bathroom
on David Lemming.

524
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:40,000
No, wait, wait!

525
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:42,880
