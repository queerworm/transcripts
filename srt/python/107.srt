<i>She makes blancmanges</i>
<i>that size?</i>

506
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:11,920
Oh, yes, you see,
we're from the planet Skyron

507
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:13,280
in the galaxy of Andromeda,

508
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:15,000
and they're all
that size there.

509
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:16,680
We tried to tell you
at the beginning of the film,

510
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:18,560
but you just panned off us.

511
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,760
<i>So the world was saved.</i>

512
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:27,320
<i>And Angus Podgorny</i>
<i>became the first Scotsman</i>

513
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:29,440
<i>to win Wimbledon...</i>

514
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:31,360
<i>fifteen years later.</i>
