Hey, Adora.

Did you mean to do that?

32
00:02:43,454 --> 00:02:46,708
-If you did, it's a terrible weapon.
-Is not.

33

-How'd you do that?

Can you teleport anything you want?
Like a cannon? I can make ice cannonballs.

What? No. Just the staff.
It was my dad's-- Ugh.

No. She is.

No, no. It's not you.

I wanna be the best She-Ra,
I wanna protect the planet.

-She isn't actually in my head.

When you grow up with someone,
they know how to push your buttons.

You have come a long way,
but there is still much to do.

65

-There is quite a bit of pressure.

-Was that not clear?
-Yeah, no, I got it. So much pressure.

00:05:44,886 --> 00:05:48,222
She-Ra is too strong
to defeat with force alone.

78
00:05:48,306 --> 00:05:50,850
But she's slow and easily manipulated.

79

Then go again.

What's the report from the woods?

Oh! I just received a transmission
from one of my bots.

[Scorpia] Oh, boy.

91
00:06:43,778 --> 00:06:47,573
-Ouch.
-Wow, it fell apart with one hit there.

92
00:06:47,657 --> 00:06:49,575
I could definitely make some improvements.

93
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:51,869
Oh, yeah. Game over.

94
00:06:51,953 --> 00:06:55,957
It doesn't matter. We'll just send
more bots, and more after that.

95
00:06:56,040 --> 00:07:00,002
They'll be so busy defending their
precious trees, we'll conquer the planet

96
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:04,132
-before they know what's happened.
-I have an even better idea.

You should've seen it.
With the Moonstone super-charged,

100
00:07:22,233 --> 00:07:27,196
I've been so much more powerful.
I took out, like, at least five bots.

101
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,450
Just like the day before,
and the day before that.

102
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:35,705
So? What are we supposed to do?
Not fight? We have to protect the woods.

103

The Horde is going to keep
taking ground until it regrows.

104
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:43,337
I know, but how long can we keep this up?
Did you learn anything from Light Hope?

That's so useful.

-We should turn it into a dagger.

Better hurry, you're gonna be late.

to the Best Friends Squad?

Shut up. Ugh.

116
00:08:23,628 --> 00:08:26,047
Sorry, heh, I think that's my chair.

117
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:30,551

00:08:32,386 --> 00:08:34,263
Aunt Casta! You made it.

120
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:36,516
I wouldn't miss it, dearest.

121
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:40,603
The first war room
of the new alliance. How exciting.

122
00:08:40,686 --> 00:08:44,106
Shame you couldn't be there
where the alliance was formed.

123
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:48,110
-I knew you'd bring that up--
-We have a great deal to discuss.

124
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:49,987
Please take your seats.

125

[grunts]

126
00:08:50,988 --> 00:08:53,991
Swift Wind,
what news do you bring from the west?

127
00:08:54,075 --> 00:08:56,827
The Horde has gained more territory
in the west.

128
00:08:56,911 --> 00:08:59,163
But with the help
of Netossa and Spinnerella,

129
00:08:59,247 --> 00:09:02,750
our forces have managed
to re-capture Thaymor. Again.

130
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:06,921
Also, why don't I get a chair?
Everyone else has a chair, I want a chair.

131
00:09:07,004 --> 00:09:09,882
A chair. Of course. I will see to it.

132
00:09:09,966 --> 00:09:12,802
Glimmer, how goes the situation
in the Whispering Woods?

133
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:17,598
I'm happy to report we are handling bots,
and protecting the woods while it regrows,

134
00:09:17,682 --> 00:09:19,809
which it is doing very slowly.

135
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:23,771
Maybe it's time we stop fighting
and start healing.

136
00:09:23,854 --> 00:09:26,816
My powers aren't strong enough
to regrow the woods.

137
00:09:26,899 --> 00:09:30,653
But when we princesses worked together
during the battle of Bright Moon,

138
00:09:30,736 --> 00:09:32,238
our powers grew.

139
00:09:32,321 --> 00:09:34,824
We should try to recapture that energy.

140
00:09:34,907 --> 00:09:36,909
Maybe we should hold hands

141
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:39,078
and think healing thoughts.

142
00:09:39,161 --> 00:09:40,746
-[humming]
-Uh...

143
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:44,667
If I may, Your Majesty.
We can't go on like this.

144
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:47,253
We're defeating the bots,
but more keep coming.

145
00:09:47,336 --> 00:09:50,214
While we're using our resources
to hold our borders,

146
00:09:50,298 --> 00:09:53,426
the Horde hasn't had to deploy
a single soldier.

147
00:09:53,509 --> 00:09:57,305
-Typical Catra.
-I've only been able to recover pieces,

148
00:09:57,388 --> 00:10:02,101
seeing as we have never not completely
demolished one of these things.

149
00:10:02,184 --> 00:10:06,272
But if we capture a whole bot,
I might be able to program a kill switch.

150
00:10:06,355 --> 00:10:09,567
We could wipe them all out
without draining our forces.

151
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:12,987
An excellent idea, Bow.
This could turn the tide for us.

152
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:14,822
Glimmer, take your patrol out,

153
00:10:14,905 --> 00:10:18,492
and capture a bot for Bow
to study and carry out his plan.

154
00:10:18,576 --> 00:10:23,289
Commander, I have ideas to improve.
First, we should all have code names.

155
00:10:23,372 --> 00:10:26,208
I'd like to be Frostbite.
And you can be Sparklebomb. Second--

156
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:27,501
Oh, uh, Frosta.

157
00:10:28,169 --> 00:10:30,212
I need you to stay back

158
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:33,174
and help Spinnerella and Netossa
guard the castle.

159
00:10:33,382 --> 00:10:34,467
Great, thanks.

160
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:39,096
[Catra] With the woods frozen,
princesses distracted by bots,

161
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:41,432
we've been able to gain
significant ground.

162
00:10:41,515 --> 00:10:44,101
[Hordak] You have not disappointed me,
Force Captain.

163
00:10:44,185 --> 00:10:47,146
Clearly, I was wise to promote you.

164
00:10:47,563 --> 00:10:49,815
[Entrapta] I'm just gonna borrow this.

165
00:10:51,442 --> 00:10:52,777
Oh, what is that?

166
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:56,530
Uh, yes.
We've kept the princesses distracted,

167
00:10:56,614 --> 00:10:58,032
but we could be doing more.

168
00:10:58,115 --> 00:11:00,826
We should be working to take them out,
once and for all.

169
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:03,287
Isn't that right, Entrapta? Entrapta!

170
00:11:03,371 --> 00:11:04,830
Oh, right.

171
00:11:09,794 --> 00:11:12,671
May I introduce Emily's Kid Sister.

172
00:11:12,755 --> 00:11:16,384
EKS for short.
With First Ones tech at its core,

173
00:11:16,467 --> 00:11:20,179
this little beauty has enough power
to rival a princess.

174
00:11:24,433 --> 00:11:28,354
Impressive indeed.
And you can make more of these?

175
00:11:28,437 --> 00:11:31,732
Yes! I mean, no. I mean, I could.

176
00:11:31,816 --> 00:11:34,902
But I only had enough First Ones tech
to make four.

177
00:11:34,985 --> 00:11:37,321
But I know where we can get more.

178
00:11:40,574 --> 00:11:42,993
Okay. We'll split up
to cover the most ground.

179
00:11:43,077 --> 00:11:47,498
Adora, Bow and I will go east.
Mermista and Perfuma, you go west.

180
00:11:47,665 --> 00:11:51,961
Swift Wind, cover the sky
and tell us when there's a bot nearby.

181
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:54,547
And, remember, we want an intact bot.

182
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:57,258
What if it's just, like,
a little waterlogged?

183
00:11:57,341 --> 00:12:00,219
And also covered in ferns
that secrete corrosive poison?

184
00:12:00,302 --> 00:12:03,472
Or what if it's totally smashed
by my ice hammer?

185
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:05,141
Frosta! [sighs]

186
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:08,936
You're supposed to be defending
the castle with Netossa and Spinnerella.

187
00:12:09,019 --> 00:12:12,148
I know I ignored orders, but, no offense,
those orders were wrong.

188
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:15,276
-You need me here.
-You can't just run off whenever.

189
00:12:15,359 --> 00:12:18,487
But I did. And I'm here now.
And I'm not going back.

190
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:21,907
Fine. You can be in Mermista
and Perfuma's patrol.

191
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:25,244
-I'm going with you.
-Don't push your luck.

192
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:31,625
Uh, guys?

193
00:12:34,128 --> 00:12:37,089
That thing is way more advanced
than usual.

194
00:12:37,715 --> 00:12:41,302
Where is it going?
Why isn't it attacking the woods?

195
00:12:41,385 --> 00:12:43,262
[grunting and shouting]

196
00:12:44,513 --> 00:12:46,307
-[bot powering down]
-[groans]

197
00:12:50,227 --> 00:12:53,856
It's still just a Horde bot.
We know how to handle-- [shouting]

198
00:12:58,486 --> 00:12:59,361
[both gasping]

199
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:03,616
Okay. [coughs] That's new.

200
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:06,827
Ha!

201
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:09,205
[grunting and shouting]

202
00:13:13,792 --> 00:13:15,169
It's learning.

203
00:13:15,252 --> 00:13:17,963
Yeah, well,
I'm about to teach it something.

204
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:21,425
For the honor of Grayskull!

205
00:13:43,405 --> 00:13:44,240
[shouts]

206
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,910
[grunting and shouting]

207
00:14:04,468 --> 00:14:06,178
[alarm blaring]

208
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:14,728
[grunts, then chuckles]

209
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:16,230
[shouts]

210
00:14:16,313 --> 00:14:17,147
What?

211
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:20,067
[groaning]

212
00:14:20,401 --> 00:14:23,070
We'll capture another bot.
That one had it coming.

213
00:14:24,488 --> 00:14:27,491
-Yeesh. I'm sorry I destroyed it.
-[yelps]

214
00:14:36,834 --> 00:14:39,545
Ooh, that's unnatural. Even for a robot.

215
00:14:39,628 --> 00:14:41,005
[alarm blaring]

216
00:14:49,263 --> 00:14:50,472
[groans]

217
00:14:52,474 --> 00:14:53,726
[grunting]

218
00:14:53,809 --> 00:14:57,688
Frosta! Do you even listen
when people tell you things?

219
00:14:57,771 --> 00:15:00,733
-What?
-Get away from that bot!

220
00:15:00,816 --> 00:15:03,986
It's the bot you should be worried about!

221
00:15:04,278 --> 00:15:05,487
[Frosta shouting]

222
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:06,530
Frosta!

223
00:15:18,042 --> 00:15:19,460
[alarm blaring]

224
00:15:25,841 --> 00:15:27,676
[both shouting]

225
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:32,056
There you are.
We've been looking everywhere for you.

226
00:15:32,139 --> 00:15:33,766
Yeah. Everywhere.

227
00:15:33,849 --> 00:15:39,396
That was incredibly stupid! You could've
gotten hurt, or gotten one of us hurt!

228
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,106
I was just trying to help.

229
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:46,820
This is serious, not a game.
You need to stop getting in our way.

230
00:15:48,322 --> 00:15:49,281
[sobs]

231
00:15:49,865 --> 00:15:51,116
Frosta, wait.

232
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:53,077
Ouch.

233
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:56,872
The Horde's new bots are too fast
and too smart.

234
00:15:56,956 --> 00:16:00,459
We'll never be able to catch one.
I thought I could help,

235
00:16:00,542 --> 00:16:04,463
and be the Rebellion's tech master.
But that was obviously a dumb idea.

236
00:16:06,548 --> 00:16:10,177
It wasn't. You're the only one
who came up with a real plan.

237
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:13,013
Without it,
we'd still just be reacting to the bots.

238
00:16:13,097 --> 00:16:15,599
We need
to stop letting the Horde manipulate us.

239
00:16:15,683 --> 00:16:18,310
So let's put our heads together and think.

240
00:16:19,353 --> 00:16:21,855
Those bots weren't interested
in the woods.

241
00:16:21,939 --> 00:16:26,694
-They defended themselves to get away.
-Well, attacking us wasn't their mission.

242
00:16:26,777 --> 00:16:31,073
-They ran off in the same direction.
-So whatever they're after is that way.

243
00:16:31,156 --> 00:16:34,284
The only thing that's in that direction
is the Beacon.

244
00:16:34,368 --> 00:16:37,997
I know where the bots are going.
I got an idea how to stop them.

245
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:40,749
Frosta, do you think you can--?
Where's Frosta?

246
00:16:42,793 --> 00:16:44,128
I'll go find her.

247
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:50,676
Come to yell at me more?
I just wanted to be your friend.

248
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:53,929
By ignoring us
and throwing yourself into danger?

249
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:57,683
Sorry I don't know how to act.
I've never had any friends before.

250
00:17:01,395 --> 00:17:04,189
I was 8 when I took over the throne.

251
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:07,943
Kind of hard to make friends
when everyone is your sworn subject.

252
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:12,031
I know how you feel. I didn't have
any friends before Bow and Adora.

253
00:17:12,114 --> 00:17:15,034
You? Figured everyone
would wanna be your friend.

254
00:17:16,326 --> 00:17:18,871
Yeah, definitely not everyone.

255
00:17:18,954 --> 00:17:21,290
And I'm still learning
how to be a good friend, too.

256
00:17:24,251 --> 00:17:26,253
I'm sorry I yelled. It's just--

257
00:17:26,795 --> 00:17:29,465
I guess you remind me of... me.

258
00:17:29,631 --> 00:17:32,968
And I can do some really dangerous stuff
sometimes.

259
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:35,345
I remind you of you?

260
00:17:37,973 --> 00:17:42,061
Ugh. And I even sounded like my mom
when I yelled at you.

261
00:17:42,144 --> 00:17:44,855
-Please don't make me do that again.
-Deal.

262
00:17:44,938 --> 00:17:48,067
-Does that mean we're friends?
-Yes.

263
00:17:48,233 --> 00:17:49,151
And we--

264
00:17:49,735 --> 00:17:52,154
I could really use your help.

265
00:17:52,237 --> 00:17:56,241
You want me to come back?
I knew we'd make a great team.

266
00:17:56,492 --> 00:18:00,621
So, should I do ice hammers or daggers?
You're right, one of each.

267
00:18:00,704 --> 00:18:01,747
[groans]

268
00:18:09,171 --> 00:18:12,049
That place has enough
First Ones tech inside

269
00:18:12,132 --> 00:18:15,177
to power a whole armada of robots forever.

270
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:17,137
Ah, I want that.

271
00:18:19,723 --> 00:18:20,641
[gasps]

272
00:18:23,811 --> 00:18:26,230
Ice of you to drop in.

273
00:18:26,313 --> 00:18:27,314
[both shouting]

274
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:34,404
[She-Ra grunts]

275
00:18:34,822 --> 00:18:36,949
Switch things up. Keep them guessing.

276
00:18:37,699 --> 00:18:38,784
[groans]

277
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:43,831
We just need to capture one.
Take the others out. [grunts]

278
00:18:50,337 --> 00:18:51,672
[both shouting]

279
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:55,592
-One bot down, but three to go!
-Fight, EKS's!

280
00:19:01,014 --> 00:19:03,016
Showed you, bot-face.

281
00:19:06,603 --> 00:19:09,189
Ooh, he is not recovering from that.

282
00:19:09,273 --> 00:19:12,192
I can't look.
Tell me what's happening. No, don't.

283
00:19:12,609 --> 00:19:13,443
[grunts]

284
00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:17,906
[groans]

285
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:21,285
Why can't you be what I want you to be?

286
00:19:23,495 --> 00:19:25,164
[grunting]

287
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:28,250
Hmm.

288
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:31,753
Hey, Catra.

289
00:19:32,796 --> 00:19:34,464
It's okay. We have two left.

290
00:19:36,717 --> 00:19:38,051
Do you have to?

291
00:19:38,135 --> 00:19:40,053
Whatever. We'll find more tech.

292
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:43,640
Bow, look! I got one.

293
00:19:45,809 --> 00:19:47,394
Adora! Get away from it!

294
00:19:47,477 --> 00:19:48,896
[She-Ra shouting]

295
00:19:49,479 --> 00:19:52,816
-What just happened?
-It looks like the bots can self-destruct.

296
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,068
[groans] Catra.

297
00:20:00,824 --> 00:20:04,161
-We can't let that one self-destruct.
-Everyone together.

298
00:20:04,244 --> 00:20:05,370
[shouting and grunting]

299
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:10,292
[groaning]

300
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:11,501
Whoopsies.

301
00:20:12,252 --> 00:20:14,838
-You ready, Ice Princess?
-Yeah.

302
00:20:15,964 --> 00:20:17,090
Yes!

303
00:20:24,097 --> 00:20:26,016
[grunting]

304
00:20:27,309 --> 00:20:28,435
Ha, ha!

305
00:20:30,938 --> 00:20:33,440
-Yeah!
-Yeah. Huh?

306
00:20:34,149 --> 00:20:35,192
[gasps] Look.

307
00:20:38,195 --> 00:20:40,697
Whoa. Did we do that?

308
00:20:42,783 --> 00:20:45,953
We did, all of us working together.

309
00:20:46,036 --> 00:20:47,412
[chuckles]

310
00:20:48,538 --> 00:20:50,040
[Mermista] Personal space.

311
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:52,668
[door alarm buzzing]

312
00:20:54,461 --> 00:20:56,129
[Catra] You look terrible.

313
00:20:57,214 --> 00:20:58,298
[Shadow Weaver] Catra.

314
00:20:58,382 --> 00:21:02,219
It's been so long.
I assumed Hordak finally realized

315
00:21:02,302 --> 00:21:05,806
what a lazy, worthless creature you are
and banished you.

316
00:21:05,889 --> 00:21:08,684
Just the opposite. Hordak values me.

317
00:21:08,767 --> 00:21:11,687
I've been busy helping the Horde
get closer than ever

318
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:14,731
to defeating the Rebellion. His words.

319
00:21:14,815 --> 00:21:18,110
[Shadow Weaver]
If you're doing so well, why are you here?

320
00:21:18,694 --> 00:21:21,571
It's Adora, isn't it? [laughing]

321
00:21:21,655 --> 00:21:22,948
[groans]

322
00:21:23,031 --> 00:21:25,033
So? I let her win one.

323
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:27,577
We're gaining ground
and our armies are growing.

324
00:21:27,661 --> 00:21:30,205
When they're ready to roll out,
I will be at the head.

325
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:32,457
And you'll be here rotting.

326
00:21:35,252 --> 00:21:38,755
[sighs] Thanks. I needed this.

327
00:21:45,887 --> 00:21:49,057
So, we're okay now the woods
are growing back, right?

328
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:51,727
Light Hope says
there's still a lot to fix,

329
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:54,896
but at least it won't be as easy
for the Horde to attack us.

330
00:21:56,440 --> 00:22:00,944
Thanks again for saving me, you know,
after that bot threw me off the cliff.

331
00:22:01,028 --> 00:22:04,656
Friends stick together.
No princess left behind.

332
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:05,782
[laughs]

333
00:22:07,075 --> 00:22:10,662
Uh, okay. I'm talking into this recorder

334
00:22:10,746 --> 00:22:14,166
because that's what the best scientist
I ever knew did.

335
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:18,253
I'm not really sure who I'm talking to.
Me, I guess.

336
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:22,424
So, hi, Future Bow.
We're about to open this thing.

337
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:28,263
First Ones tech?

338
00:22:28,346 --> 00:22:31,183
But the only one
who knew how to use that was--

339
00:22:31,266 --> 00:22:34,686
Hold onto your hat, Future Bow.
Entrapta's alive.

340
00:22:37,189 --> 00:22:38,982
