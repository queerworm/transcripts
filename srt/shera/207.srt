00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:27,485
{\an8}Serenia portal Mara.

2
00:00:28,778 --> 00:00:30,905
{\an8}Maybe Mara's last name is Serenia,

3
00:00:30,989 --> 00:00:34,075
{\an8}or the portal is a Serenia?

4
00:00:34,617 --> 00:00:35,493
{\an8}[sighs]

5
00:00:36,286 --> 00:00:39,164
{\an8}I'll be honest with you, future Bow,
I'm getting nowhere.

00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:41,541
[tracker pad beeping]

7
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:45,420
No. Was that today?

8
00:00:45,503 --> 00:00:47,672
This can't be happening, not now.

9
00:00:47,756 --> 00:00:49,174
No, no, no.

10
00:00:57,432 --> 00:00:59,184
-Adora, get up.
-[shouts]

11
00:00:59,726 --> 00:01:03,563
-What's going on? What is it?
-It's Bow. He's in trouble.

Bow's tracker pad and arrows are gone.

23
00:01:40,517 --> 00:01:43,228
He must have left after he shot
that note through my window.

24
00:01:43,311 --> 00:01:46,356
The note that says,
"I'm fine. Don't follow me"?

25
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:48,858
He's not fine. We have to follow him.

26
00:01:48,942 --> 00:01:51,528
If he was,
he would've told us he was leaving.

27
00:01:51,611 --> 00:01:53,571
After finding out the signal
is about Mara--

28
00:01:53,655 --> 00:01:57,700
Okay, okay, Glimmer, just calm down.
I agree, okay?

29
00:01:58,118 --> 00:02:00,537
So, where does Bow go
when he's not at Bright Moon?

30
00:02:00,703 --> 00:02:01,830
Uh...

31
00:02:02,247 --> 00:02:04,165
Seriously? How long have you been friends?

32
00:02:04,249 --> 00:02:07,210
Look, Bow really values his privacy.

33
00:02:07,293 --> 00:02:10,922
He's never talked about his past
or where he came from. Never.

34
00:02:11,005 --> 00:02:13,800
And you know how talkative
and open Bow is.

35
00:02:13,883 --> 00:02:16,386
Something's wrong.
What if he's in trouble?

36
00:02:19,222 --> 00:02:23,309
Bow definitely came this way,
judging from the broken twigs, the sap

37
00:02:23,393 --> 00:02:25,436
and his distinct footprints.

38
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:30,984
[gasps] There's no way Bow
would ever leave his trick arrows behind.

39
00:02:31,067 --> 00:02:32,735
I told you, he's in trouble.

40
00:02:33,611 --> 00:02:34,863
What is that place?

41
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:45,498
We have to find Bow,
and get him out of this, uh...

42
00:02:46,374 --> 00:02:47,208
library?

43
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:56,009
Have you ever heard of a library
in the Whispering Woods?

44
00:02:56,885 --> 00:02:58,344
[both gasping]

45
00:03:02,181 --> 00:03:03,182
[sighs]

46
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:04,601
[shouts]

47
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:08,771
-Bow, I'm so glad we found you.
-We're here to break you out,

48
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:12,483
or fight your kidnappers.
We're not sure what we're-- Uh...

49
00:03:12,817 --> 00:03:17,530
[gasps] What have they done to you?
[groans]

50
00:03:17,655 --> 00:03:21,451
-We got your arrows. Who are we fighting?
-No one. You shouldn't be here.

51
00:03:21,534 --> 00:03:23,536
You need to leave now, before--

52
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:24,829
[shouting]

53
00:03:29,584 --> 00:03:31,836
[George] Who's there?
Who are these people?

54
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:35,965
Play along. This is Adora and Glimmer,
my friends from the academy.

55
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:39,302
Adora, Glimmer, meet my dads.

56
00:03:40,011 --> 00:03:41,721
Adora, Glimmer.

57
00:03:41,804 --> 00:03:45,558
Oh, we're so happy to finally meet
Bow's school friends.

58
00:03:45,642 --> 00:03:47,268
[all grunting]

59
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:53,608
I need you to beef up security.

60
00:03:53,691 --> 00:03:56,069
Bring all reports directly to me.
No one else.

61
00:03:56,152 --> 00:03:58,238
I want patrols doubled. Above all--

62
00:04:00,782 --> 00:04:01,699
[shouts]

63
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:05,245
[clearing throat] Uh...

64
00:04:05,328 --> 00:04:06,329
You were saying?

65
00:04:06,412 --> 00:04:09,832
Yes, and report anything suspicious
directly to me.

66
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:12,961
You mean like the fact
that Shadow Weaver's cell is empty?

67
00:04:13,044 --> 00:04:16,589
[growls] I threw the prisoner
into solitary last night.

68
00:04:16,673 --> 00:04:19,467
Not that I need to explain myself
to underlings.

69
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:23,721
-Catra, Lonnie was trying to answer your--
-[Catra] You have your orders.

70
00:04:23,805 --> 00:04:28,351
Next person who questions me gets to see
Shadow Weaver's cell up close. Move.

71
00:04:30,353 --> 00:04:32,313
I said, move.

72
00:04:37,235 --> 00:04:38,278
Catra--

73
00:04:46,995 --> 00:04:48,496
[both chuckling nervously]

74
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:54,127
You want anything,
you just tell me, and I'll get it.

75
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:55,878
Snacks? I'll get you snacks.

76
00:04:56,337 --> 00:04:58,631
Yes, so energetic. Heh.

77
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:02,802
You girls must love attending the Academy
of Historic Enterprises with Bow.

78
00:05:03,261 --> 00:05:05,430
Yes. Absolutely.

79
00:05:06,222 --> 00:05:08,391
Yup. Wouldn't change a thing. [chuckles]

80
00:05:08,474 --> 00:05:11,602
At the academy, that we all go to.

81
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:18,651
Oh, I bet you're here to see
our collection of First Ones artifacts.

82
00:05:18,735 --> 00:05:20,945
We got some new pottery shards. I--

83
00:05:21,571 --> 00:05:23,573
-Oh, what was I doing?
-Snacks.

84
00:05:23,656 --> 00:05:25,450
Oh, yes, yes, yes. Snacks.

85
00:05:25,908 --> 00:05:29,287
The pottery is something.
Bow's older brother sent it.

86
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:30,204
[coughing]

87
00:05:30,288 --> 00:05:33,708
-Brother?
-Oh, Bow has an older brother? How nice.

88
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:38,338
Youngest of 13,
all historians just like us.

89
00:05:38,421 --> 00:05:42,592
And just like Bow when he graduates
and takes over the library.

90
00:05:42,675 --> 00:05:43,509
Right, Bow?

91
00:05:46,471 --> 00:05:51,017
Don't bother, Lance.
It looks like he's not very cha-tea today.

92
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:52,977
-[laughing]
-[groans]

93
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:59,317
Okay, thanks for the tea and the snacks,
but I think my friends would really like--

94
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,943
A tour of the library.

95
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:04,989
Of course, our Bow would find people
who share his zest for history.

96
00:06:05,073 --> 00:06:08,326
Wait till we show you
the oldest part of our collection.

97
00:06:08,409 --> 00:06:11,579
A shard from an ancient,
defunct rune stone.

98
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:15,708
If it wasn't of historical value,
that would be gone.

99
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:18,503
No need to keep a reminder
of the Princesses and their war.

100
00:06:18,586 --> 00:06:21,089
Uh... But the Horde started the war.

101
00:06:21,172 --> 00:06:23,549
The Princesses are fighting
to save Etheria.

102
00:06:23,633 --> 00:06:27,929
You're too young to remember the first
failed Princess Alliance. I'm not.

103
00:06:28,471 --> 00:06:31,265
I enlisted,
fought for what I thought was right.

104
00:06:31,349 --> 00:06:33,684
-Dad, can we not--?
-When I came home,

105
00:06:33,768 --> 00:06:35,770
there was nothing left
of my village but ash.

106
00:06:35,853 --> 00:06:39,273
I vowed that my family
would never get mixed up in fighting

107
00:06:39,357 --> 00:06:40,775
or the Princesses again.

108
00:06:48,783 --> 00:06:52,370
Well, I know what will lighten the mood,
baby pictures.

109
00:06:52,453 --> 00:06:55,581
I've got some great ones
from Bow's first bubble bath.

110
00:06:56,374 --> 00:06:59,001
I'm gonna show Adora and Glimmer
my room now.

111
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:01,254
-I wanna see the bubble baths.
-Now.

112
00:07:01,754 --> 00:07:02,880
[groans]

113
00:07:05,591 --> 00:07:07,009
Bow, what is going on?

114
00:07:07,635 --> 00:07:08,594
[groans]

115
00:07:09,345 --> 00:07:11,848
My dads don't know
I'm a Rebellion fighter.

116
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:14,851
They think I'm at boarding school.
I'm supposed to be on break.

117
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:18,187
So, this is why you never talked
about your past?

118
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:21,149
I thought it was because
it was dark and painful,

119
00:07:21,232 --> 00:07:24,026
but your dads seem so nice and normal.

120
00:07:24,735 --> 00:07:26,904
Look, I love my dads, okay?

121
00:07:26,988 --> 00:07:28,614
I never mentioned them,

122
00:07:29,532 --> 00:07:33,327
because they decided when I was a kid
that I was gonna stay home,

123
00:07:33,411 --> 00:07:37,165
take over the library when they retire.
But I wanted to travel, to fight.

124
00:07:37,248 --> 00:07:39,333
So, I did the only thing I could.

125
00:07:40,084 --> 00:07:42,086
I taught myself archery, ran away,

126
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:44,589
and pretended I was
at a made-up boarding school.

127
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:47,049
That seems really elaborate, Bow.

128
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:49,969
You saw what they're like.
They don't listen.

129
00:07:50,052 --> 00:07:52,138
They assume they know what I want.

130
00:07:52,221 --> 00:07:55,224
And if Lance knew
I didn't want to be a historian...

131
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:58,478
Worse, if George knew
that I'm a Rebellion soldier

132
00:07:58,561 --> 00:08:01,564
fighting alongside Princesses,
it'd kill them.

133
00:08:01,647 --> 00:08:06,110
-So, you're gonna lie to them forever?
-Not forever.

134
00:08:06,194 --> 00:08:08,946
Just for the foreseeable future.

135
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:11,157
It's worked so far. Please.

136
00:08:11,657 --> 00:08:12,533
For me?

137
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:13,910
[groans]

138
00:08:14,702 --> 00:08:17,246
Besides, my dads have
the biggest collection

139
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:20,124
of First Ones artifacts
and writings in Etheria.

140
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:23,628
This is the perfect place to look
for answers about She-Ra,

141
00:08:23,711 --> 00:08:26,756
the Mara message, Serenia, everything.

142
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:28,508
Sure, why not.

143
00:08:28,591 --> 00:08:30,218
We can be scholars.

144
00:08:30,676 --> 00:08:31,844
How hard can it be?

145
00:08:32,303 --> 00:08:34,972
[groans] This is gonna be a disaster.

146
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:37,558
Well, maybe with that attitude it will be.

147
00:08:39,101 --> 00:08:43,439
By the way, I may have said in my letters
that Glimmer is a physics major,

148
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:46,567
Adora's an art major, nobody is a Princess
or has magical powers,

149
00:08:46,651 --> 00:08:49,278
and we all met freshmen year.
Okay? Let's go.

150
00:08:52,073 --> 00:08:53,032
[groans]

151
00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:56,327
Hey, Catra.

152
00:08:56,410 --> 00:09:00,122
Listen, I've been looking
for anything suspicious like you said,

153
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:04,544
but this is the Fright Zone, so,
that's pretty much everything. [chuckles]

154
00:09:04,627 --> 00:09:08,548
I was hoping you could tell me
what I'm supposed to be looking for?

155
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:13,886
If you spent more time following orders
and less time questioning them,

156
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:16,639
you wouldn't need me to. Now get out. Go.

157
00:09:16,722 --> 00:09:19,809
Okay, wildcat.
I really didn't wanna have to do this,

158
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:23,187
-but you leave me no choice.
-What are you doing?

159
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:30,194
[shouts]

160
00:09:30,278 --> 00:09:32,029
Just let all your cares go.

161
00:09:32,113 --> 00:09:34,991
-You're safe. You're safe here.
-Stop it. Stop.

162
00:09:35,074 --> 00:09:37,618
-You're safe here, okay?
-Let go of me. Are you crazy?

163
00:09:37,702 --> 00:09:40,955
-There's nothing we can't handle.
-I lost Shadow Weaver.

164
00:09:41,038 --> 00:09:43,916
-How are we supposed to handle that?
-What?

165
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:47,086
Shadow Weaver escaped.

166
00:09:47,169 --> 00:09:50,214
I have to find her
before Hordak learns the truth.

167
00:09:50,298 --> 00:09:53,884
Well, you don't have to do this alone.
I'm here.

168
00:09:53,968 --> 00:09:56,637
-I bet Entrapta can whip up a locator.
-No.

169
00:09:56,721 --> 00:10:00,057
Entrapta spends time with Hordak
and is bad with secrets.

170
00:10:00,141 --> 00:10:03,436
The minute we tell Entrapta,
she tells him, then it's over for me.

171
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:07,982
Then we make sure that doesn't happen.

172
00:10:08,316 --> 00:10:12,153
We'll find Shadow Weaver, the two of us,
and not a word of it will leave this room.

173
00:10:14,071 --> 00:10:15,156
[giggles]

174
00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:21,037
This is the 1000-year-old Colonia pitcher.

175
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:24,248
And this tablet dates back
over two millennia.

176
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:30,046
And this is where Bow played pretend
as a little boy.

177
00:10:31,547 --> 00:10:32,590
[groans]

178
00:10:32,673 --> 00:10:36,510
-Let me guess, playing pirates?
-Oh, no. Bow doesn't like pirates.

179
00:10:36,594 --> 00:10:40,931
Playing historian, getting ready
to take over the library even then.

180
00:10:41,015 --> 00:10:42,350
-Right, Bow?
-Right.

181
00:10:43,934 --> 00:10:48,481
Mr. Bow's Dad, sir,
as First Ones historians,

182
00:10:48,606 --> 00:10:51,067
do you know anything
about the lore of She-Ra?

183
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:53,486
Ah... Great question.

184
00:10:53,569 --> 00:10:56,072
Accurate translations are hard to come by,

185
00:10:56,155 --> 00:10:58,949
but we think the name
was actually, Her-Ra.

186
00:10:59,283 --> 00:11:03,829
-[chuckles] Well, that's not right.
-But you don't know that for sure, Adora.

187
00:11:04,288 --> 00:11:07,041
She'd fight for the power of Grayskull.

188
00:11:07,124 --> 00:11:10,795
-It's "For the Honor of Grayskull."
-And rode on a dragon.

189
00:11:12,963 --> 00:11:13,881
[gasps]

190
00:11:13,964 --> 00:11:16,384
Wait, she got a dragon? I wish I had a--

191
00:11:16,467 --> 00:11:17,301
[grumbling]

192
00:11:17,676 --> 00:11:18,844
[laughing]

193
00:11:20,388 --> 00:11:21,931
Anyway, uh, where was I?

194
00:11:22,431 --> 00:11:23,682
Princess nonsense.

195
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:27,603
The rune stone shard.

196
00:11:27,686 --> 00:11:31,190
It's the oldest First Ones object
in our collection.

197
00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:32,858
But enough about us.

198
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:35,861
Tell us about your studies,
Adora and Glimmer.

199
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:38,406
Uh, you know, the physics are good.

200
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:40,533
The history is also good.

201
00:11:40,616 --> 00:11:43,536
Uh... I thought you were an art major?

202
00:11:44,161 --> 00:11:47,289
-Uh, she's a double major.
-Uh, yes.

203
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:51,627
History, art, art history, that's three.
I'm a triple major.

204
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:54,713
I also teach,
unless that's not a thing students do.

205
00:11:54,797 --> 00:11:58,759
-Is it hot here? I mean...
-It's great to finally meet you, Glimmer.

206
00:11:58,843 --> 00:12:01,429
-We thought Bow was making you up.
-Really?

207
00:12:01,512 --> 00:12:06,100
You know how Bow is, shy, quiet,
not so many friends.

208
00:12:06,183 --> 00:12:09,186
From his letters, it sounds like
you brought him out of his shell.

209
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:11,522
Yeah. I guess I did.

210
00:12:12,189 --> 00:12:16,777
So, for school, heh,
we got this First Ones puzzle to solve.

211
00:12:16,861 --> 00:12:18,529
The last word is giving us trouble.

212
00:12:18,696 --> 00:12:20,948
-Have you ever heard of Serenia?
-Ooh!

213
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:25,161
Serenia was the name
of a mythical First Ones hero.

214
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:28,539
Although some of us think
she was a real person.

215
00:12:28,622 --> 00:12:29,540
Mm-hm.

216
00:12:29,623 --> 00:12:35,254
Some of us also think the Elberon vase
dates back only one millennia.

217
00:12:35,337 --> 00:12:39,341
-Is this everything you have on Serenia?
-Oh, no. I'm so sorry. Ha, ha.

218
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:43,304
Everything from the first floor.
There's more on the second.

219
00:12:43,387 --> 00:12:47,391
-This is gonna take hours.
-Hours, days, maybe weeks.

220
00:12:47,475 --> 00:12:51,812
And if you're really lucky,
it might take you a whole lifetime.

221
00:12:51,896 --> 00:12:53,814
Oh. You're so corny.

222
00:12:54,356 --> 00:12:57,776
Well, this one's just about aqueducts,
so, it's mislabeled.

223
00:12:58,903 --> 00:13:03,574
-Wait, you can read First Ones writing?
-Uh, I also study linguistics.

224
00:13:03,657 --> 00:13:06,494
It's a fifth major or fourth major.
I'm losing count.

225
00:13:06,577 --> 00:13:09,455
-What does this say?
-Uh, it says, "lunch."

226
00:13:09,538 --> 00:13:13,501
-Oh, no. I thought it said love.
-[laughing] You thought it said...?

227
00:13:15,252 --> 00:13:17,171
I like this girl!

228
00:13:18,672 --> 00:13:22,343
Actually, there's one more debate
you can settle for us, Adora.

229
00:13:22,426 --> 00:13:25,804
I don't know. Maybe I should help
with the, uh, school project.

230
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:29,934
But I guess it couldn't hurt.

231
00:13:30,017 --> 00:13:33,812
Great. Onward, best research squad.

232
00:13:40,402 --> 00:13:42,571
[sighs] We're still getting nowhere.

233
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:45,658
What does a mythological First Ones hero
have to do with Mara?

234
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:48,827
Hey, Glimmer, what's up?

235
00:13:49,954 --> 00:13:51,956
What's up with you?

236
00:13:52,039 --> 00:13:55,793
You have a secret family,
and you're supposed to be a historian,

237
00:13:55,876 --> 00:14:00,214
and you apparently hate pirates,
and you never told me about any of this.

238
00:14:01,757 --> 00:14:04,051
I feel like I don't know you at all.

239
00:14:04,134 --> 00:14:08,013
Glimmer, you know everything about me,
the real me.

240
00:14:08,097 --> 00:14:11,934
I act like someone I'm not with my family
because the truth would hurt them.

241
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:14,603
And it's making you miserable.

242
00:14:15,145 --> 00:14:19,275
Bow, your dads love you.
I'm sure they'll love the real you, too.

243
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:23,404
You don't know that.
They've had a plan since I was a baby.

244
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:26,824
But the truth is,
I'm nothing like the rest of my family.

245
00:14:26,907 --> 00:14:30,160
I've tried to tell them,
but they don't want to hear it.

246
00:14:30,244 --> 00:14:31,412
So, I pretend.

247
00:14:35,165 --> 00:14:39,169
[Lance] This was found in the
same dig site as the rune stone shard.

248
00:14:39,253 --> 00:14:42,923
Thing is, we can't agree on what it is.

249
00:14:43,007 --> 00:14:44,341
So, what's it say?

250
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:50,014
Oh, this one's easy.

251
00:14:50,097 --> 00:14:52,600
This is a password to open it.

252
00:14:52,683 --> 00:14:54,602
-It says, "Eternia."
-[all grunt]

253
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:58,689
Ooh, ooh. It's working! It's--

254
00:15:01,191 --> 00:15:03,652
-It's-- It's...
-A monster.

255
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:04,987
[roaring]

256
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:06,363
[all shouting]

257
00:15:14,872 --> 00:15:17,875
It's an Elemental.
This'll be a piece of cake.

258
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:18,876
Adora, wait.

259
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:22,796
For the Honor of Grayskull!

260
00:15:30,804 --> 00:15:31,805
[both shouting]

261
00:15:32,514 --> 00:15:35,726
Adora is a sixth major in She-Ra?

262
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:41,398
Don't worry, I got this. Ha, ha.

263
00:15:41,899 --> 00:15:43,192
[shouting]

264
00:15:44,109 --> 00:15:45,694
Hey, leave her alone.

265
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:48,030
[shouting]

266
00:15:51,241 --> 00:15:53,077
Hold on, Glimmer. I'm coming.

267
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:03,754
They really get into
their studies. [chuckles]

268
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:11,303
Bow, are your friends Princesses?

269
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:14,473
You'll tell us what is happening,
young man, or--

270
00:16:14,556 --> 00:16:17,893
We have to act before the Elemental
turns on us.

271
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:20,354
-You know what that is?
-We've run into them before.

272
00:16:20,437 --> 00:16:23,023
They only attack when they're trying
to protect something.

273
00:16:23,107 --> 00:16:27,194
-What is it trying to protect?
-You've run into them? Who are you?

274
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:32,950
It was found alongside the shard.
Could it be that?

275
00:16:33,033 --> 00:16:34,451
Dad, you're a genius.

276
00:16:34,535 --> 00:16:38,038
I'll explain everything,
but right now you have to trust me.

277
00:16:38,622 --> 00:16:40,332
Bow? Bow!

278
00:16:40,749 --> 00:16:41,583
[grunts]

279
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:43,377
Bow, you get back here.

280
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:44,920
[both grunting]

281
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:46,463
Never mind. Stay away!

282
00:16:46,547 --> 00:16:47,798
-Glimmer.
-Got it.

283
00:16:47,881 --> 00:16:49,466
[both shouting]

284
00:16:52,261 --> 00:16:53,887
It's been really nice meeting you.

285
00:16:59,226 --> 00:17:00,436
[groaning]

286
00:17:05,149 --> 00:17:06,442
Can't reach.

287
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:14,199
Bow!

288
00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:15,659
Got it.

289
00:17:21,331 --> 00:17:22,166
Huh?

290
00:17:24,126 --> 00:17:25,085
Whoa!

291
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:29,840
Bow.

292
00:17:29,923 --> 00:17:31,258
[Elemental roaring]

293
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:34,053
Huh?

294
00:17:46,315 --> 00:17:47,649
That's my Bow.

295
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:50,319
-[grunts, then laughs]
-[George] What is going on?

296
00:18:04,374 --> 00:18:06,210
I... I lied to you.

297
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:09,379
There is no Academy
of Historic Enterprises.

298
00:18:09,463 --> 00:18:12,841
I've been living at Bright Moon,
fighting in the Rebellion

299
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:15,511
alongside Adora and Princess Glimmer.

300
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:17,763
But why?

301
00:18:17,846 --> 00:18:19,598
I don't wanna be a historian.

302
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:22,559
I've never wanted to be a historian.

303
00:18:22,643 --> 00:18:26,188
I'm not a shy bookworm.
I'm not a genius like you two.

304
00:18:26,688 --> 00:18:28,857
I make things. I'm a soldier.

305
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:32,027
This is who I am.
And I can't lie about it anymore,

306
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:34,530
even though I'm breaking your hearts.

307
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:48,627
What's breaking our hearts is the fact
that you thought you had to lie

308
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:50,963
-about who you are.
-You're not mad?

309
00:18:51,463 --> 00:18:54,299
But I'm a fighter, and you hate fighters.

310
00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:57,261
I could never hate you. Never.

311
00:18:57,344 --> 00:18:59,972
If you feel like you belong
in the Rebellion,

312
00:19:00,055 --> 00:19:01,473
that's where you belong.

313
00:19:01,557 --> 00:19:04,476
Oh, Bow, why didn't you just tell us?

314
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:07,104
I tried, but you didn't listen.

315
00:19:07,521 --> 00:19:10,899
You only listened to me
if I said what you wanted to hear.

316
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:14,444
We had no idea you felt that way.

317
00:19:14,528 --> 00:19:18,532
We were just trying to encourage you
to pursue your dreams.

318
00:19:18,949 --> 00:19:22,619
We thought we were being supportive
when really we were being terrible.

319
00:19:22,703 --> 00:19:25,497
We love you the way you are.
We're proud of you,

320
00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:28,041
no matter what path you take in life.

321
00:19:31,545 --> 00:19:32,629
[sobbing]

322
00:19:33,213 --> 00:19:37,134
This is a family hug, Princesses.
You're Bow's family, too.

323
00:19:43,473 --> 00:19:47,227
On our mission, we received
a message from an unknown source.

324
00:19:47,311 --> 00:19:51,148
If we knew what Serenia meant,
we could figure out the rest.

325
00:19:51,231 --> 00:19:55,068
"Serenia portal Mara." Okay.
But what are these other words?

326
00:19:55,694 --> 00:19:58,322
I don't know. It's too degraded to read.

327
00:19:58,405 --> 00:20:01,200
Wait. Lance,
what does this pattern look like?

328
00:20:01,283 --> 00:20:04,661
-[gasps] Oh, I think you're right.
-What is it?

329
00:20:04,745 --> 00:20:08,248
Look at it, Bow. Really look at it.
What do you see?

330
00:20:11,418 --> 00:20:15,047
-These aren't words at all, are they?
-Oh, now you've got it.

331
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:16,715
George, get the projector.

332
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:23,055
[George] The world of the First Ones was
different from ours. Climate, language,

333
00:20:23,138 --> 00:20:24,556
even the sky was different,

334
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:27,643
filled with cosmic formations
they called...

335
00:20:29,603 --> 00:20:31,104
Stars.

336
00:20:31,188 --> 00:20:35,025
[Lance] The First Ones used them
to navigate and named constellations

337
00:20:35,108 --> 00:20:39,571
after mythical heroes, including Serenia.

338
00:20:39,655 --> 00:20:42,741
The Constellation Serenia
would only appear in summer

339
00:20:42,824 --> 00:20:44,701
and only over one place.

340
00:20:45,869 --> 00:20:48,664
-The Crimson Waste.
-That's where we have to go.

341
00:20:48,747 --> 00:20:51,291
[Lance] What? You can't
go into the Crimson Waste.

342
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:54,753
It's a no-man's-land,
a giant lifeless desert.

343
00:20:54,836 --> 00:20:57,923
No one's ever made it that far
and come back alive.

344
00:20:58,006 --> 00:21:00,133
Promise me, you kids will stay away.

345
00:21:06,515 --> 00:21:10,477
-You wanted to speak with me, Lord Hordak?
-Yes, Force Captain.

346
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:13,272
I wished to touch base, as you put it.

347
00:21:13,355 --> 00:21:17,734
-See how my orders are being carried out.
-Everything is running smoothly.

348
00:21:17,818 --> 00:21:21,655
Does this mean Shadow Weaver
has been transferred to Beast Island,

349
00:21:21,738 --> 00:21:23,073
per my orders?

350
00:21:24,032 --> 00:21:26,910
Yes. I sent her yesterday,
just like you ordered.

351
00:21:26,994 --> 00:21:28,745
Believe me, we're never going to see--

352
00:21:28,829 --> 00:21:30,747
[Catra on recording] <i>I lost Shadow Weaver!</i>

353
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:35,711
<i>Shadow Weaver escaped.</i>

354
00:21:37,087 --> 00:21:39,631
<i>I have to find her</i>
<i>before Hordak learns the truth.</i>

355
00:21:39,715 --> 00:21:42,759
<i>I have to find her</i>
<i>before Hordak learns the truth.</i>

356
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:47,264
[giggles]

357
00:21:47,681 --> 00:21:49,975
You lied to me.

358
00:21:53,103 --> 00:21:53,937
Wait.

359
00:21:54,438 --> 00:21:55,689
[machine powering up]

360
00:22:01,778 --> 00:22:02,612
[gasping]

361
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:06,867
[Hordak] I know your lax security
allowed Shadow Weaver to escape.

362
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:11,330
I know you've been covering it up,
lying about her whereabouts.

363
00:22:12,831 --> 00:22:17,377
But worst of all,
I gave you the chance to come clean,

364
00:22:17,461 --> 00:22:21,048
to prove your worth to me, to the Horde.

365
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:23,383
This was a test.

366
00:22:24,801 --> 00:22:27,179
And you failed.
