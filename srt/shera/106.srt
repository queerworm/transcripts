{\an8}Oh, buttered biscuits.
I'll never get used to these things.

[whirring and beeping]

8
00:00:55,764 --> 00:00:59,350
At least I don't have to get lost
in that maze anymore.

00:01:20,413 --> 00:01:21,247
A pig.

10
00:01:21,706 --> 00:01:22,665
So cute.

[powering down]

00:01:40,225 --> 00:01:43,228
Log. Day 103. 104? No, definitely 103.

13
00:01:43,311 --> 00:01:48,149
First Ones artifact number 58 has yielded
a treasure trove of intact code.

14
00:01:48,525 --> 00:01:50,193
If I can successfully translate it,

15
00:01:50,276 --> 00:01:52,445
it could hold the secrets
of the First Ones.

16
00:02:01,162 --> 00:02:03,248
[alarm ringing]

17
00:02:05,166 --> 00:02:06,292
[groaning]

18
00:02:07,293 --> 00:02:08,294
Oh.

19
00:02:09,462 --> 00:02:12,799
Fascinating. My robots
seem to be responding to the code.

20
00:02:12,882 --> 00:02:16,636
This is remarkable. Could this be
my big step yet towards making ancient

21
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:19,973
and modern technology
truly compatible? [shouts]

22
00:02:23,268 --> 00:02:24,561
Edit to log.

23
00:02:26,646 --> 00:02:28,314

Princess Entrapta will be a total catch

My mom's gonna be so impressed!

35
00:03:06,728 --> 00:03:10,148
Uh, I'm all for impressing Angella,
but why is Entrapta so important?

36
00:03:10,231 --> 00:03:11,816
She's brilliant inventor.

37
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:15,069
She makes robots and rehabs old tech
left by the First Ones.

38
00:03:15,153 --> 00:03:17,864
She's a pretty big deal
in the Etherian makers community.

39
00:03:19,616 --> 00:03:23,494
Which I am a part of,
because I dabble in gadgetry myself.

40
00:03:25,914 --> 00:03:27,081
What does any of that mean?

41
00:03:27,165 --> 00:03:30,501
It means if we convince Entrapta
to join the Rebellion,

42
00:03:30,585 --> 00:03:33,338
she'll invent all sorts
of cool junk for us.

43
00:03:33,421 --> 00:03:36,799
And then we'll finally have weapons
that can stand up to the Horde's.

44
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:38,051
Like my trick arrows!

45
00:03:38,134 --> 00:03:39,969
I'm running low, so I built new ones.

46
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:43,848
This one is a stun arrow,
this one is an emergency flare.

47
00:03:43,932 --> 00:03:46,392
And this one? This one's just pointy.

48
00:03:46,476 --> 00:03:48,144
And here's my newest one.

49
00:03:50,813 --> 00:03:52,690
Sonic arrow!

50
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:56,569
[laughs] When will we ever need
a sonic arrow?

51
00:03:56,653 --> 00:04:00,907
-If we have to wake up really early?
-Or if we get separated in a crowd?

52
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:02,242
[both laughing]

53
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:09,332
"Separated in a crowd." [groans]
I bet Entrapta will like my arrows.

54
00:04:12,543 --> 00:04:13,878
Must've been a rockslide.

55
00:04:13,962 --> 00:04:17,257
Any loud sound could cause another slide.

56
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:19,634
We need to be as quiet as--

57
00:04:19,717 --> 00:04:22,387
For the honor of Grayskull!

00:04:33,147 --> 00:04:36,818
-Ha! I'm getting the hang of this.
-That was incredibly dangerous.

62
00:04:36,901 --> 00:04:38,861
What the big deal? It worked.

63
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:41,364
You can't just bust
through everything with magic!

64
00:04:41,447 --> 00:04:44,867
-She-Ra could've caused an avalanche.
-But she didn't, okay?

65
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:48,621
I spent my whole life without powers.
No way am I gonna stop using them now.

67
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:55,295
Whoa. She's got lightning!

68
00:04:57,005 --> 00:05:00,049
Something's wrong.
The castle's distress beacon is lit.

69
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:01,718
They must be under attack.

70
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:04,387
There's been no report of the Horde
in this area.

71
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:05,722
Whoa, wait. Be careful!

-This place feels wrong. It's nothing.

00:05:27,869 --> 00:05:29,454
Hey! Who's there?

76
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:33,875
Hello? Princess Entrapta?

77
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:38,254
We're here to, uh, recruit you
for the Rebellion.

Okay. We need to be careful.

81
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:55,063
[panting] Entrapta has traps set up
all over her castle.

82
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:58,066

They're supposed to be really cool.

84
00:05:59,609 --> 00:06:01,778
They're coming. Get out of the square.

-Who's coming? Is it the Horde?
-Hello? Come back!

86
00:06:06,491 --> 00:06:10,161
I'm thinking we should probably move away
from whatever is making that sound.

87
00:06:10,244 --> 00:06:11,079
This way.

91
00:06:36,562 --> 00:06:40,858
Looks like one of Entrapta's designs.
Why would it attack us?

92
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:44,445
-All right, stand back.
-Careful. It could be a--

He needs us!

97
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:07,844
-We have to get out first.
-Come on. I'll teleport us out.

98
00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:11,848
-Uh, is this out?
-Ugh.

[both shrieking]

100
00:07:18,146 --> 00:07:21,774
-Okay, no more teleporting from now on.
-Sounds like a good idea.

Princesses. I'm saved.

104
00:07:36,914 --> 00:07:41,210
Princess Entrapta?
I mean, so good to see you.

105
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:44,172
I hope you don't mind,
but we sort of let ourselves in.

106
00:07:44,255 --> 00:07:48,134
And then we let ourselves out
of your cage trap thing. [coughs]

107
00:07:48,217 --> 00:07:49,677
Welcome to Dryl.

108
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:54,223
Things are usually really fun around here,
but right now it's all kind of deadly.

[grunting] Let me go.

00:07:57,643 --> 00:08:01,606
Please keep your voice down, sir.
The robots respond to sound.

111
00:08:01,689 --> 00:08:06,235
-We're just trying to help you.
-Oh, thanks. What's going on?

112
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:08,237
Why are the robots attacking people?

113
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:10,948
We don't know!
We're just the kitchen staff.

114
00:08:11,032 --> 00:08:14,494
Miniature cupcake?
Princess Entrapta only eats tiny food.

115
00:08:14,577 --> 00:08:18,414
-[Soda Pop] And delicious fizzy beverages.
-Uh... Thank you?

116
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:20,249
You'll be safe in here with us.

117
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:23,586
We've got enough food to last for months.
It's tiny, but still.

118

The bots will run out of power
eventually, right?

We need to do something.
You can't just hide in here forever.

120

Oh, yes, we can.

121
00:08:31,844 --> 00:08:36,182

You're lucky I found you.
I designed the castle as a labyrinth.

I'm the only one who can navigate it. Oh!

131
00:09:01,165 --> 00:09:03,251
Which means you can help us
find our friend?

132
00:09:03,334 --> 00:09:05,336
Absolutely. [grunts]

133
00:09:07,922 --> 00:09:09,423
Is she sure about that?

134
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:14,178
-I think we passed this picture already.
-Oh, isn't it cute?

135
00:09:15,763 --> 00:09:16,722
You might be right.

136
00:09:16,806 --> 00:09:18,683
I usually have my electronic map
to get around,

137
00:09:18,766 --> 00:09:21,686
but, like my bots,
it's sort of evil right now.

138
00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:25,815
-Uh, yeah, about that--
-Why did you invent killer robots?

It's First Ones tech. Can I touch it?

and no, not right now.

-Ahem. About the killer robots?
-They didn't start that way.

143
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:41,330
Usually, they're super useful.
They do almost everything for me.

Cleaning, filing, basic hygiene.

145
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:46,711
Ooh, and they're sound-activated.
Here, I'll show you.

Shoot it already!

174
00:11:34,735 --> 00:11:37,488
I can't, it's a sonic arrow.
It'll draw more bots.

175
00:11:37,571 --> 00:11:38,531
[whimpering]

176
00:11:44,578 --> 00:11:45,746
Is it over?

177
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:47,832
I did that?

178
00:11:47,915 --> 00:11:49,542
Hey, I did that.

179
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:52,336
Nice work. Now let's find my friends.
Come on.

180
00:11:53,963 --> 00:11:55,756
Adora. Wake up.

181
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,341
Please, wake up.

182
00:11:58,467 --> 00:12:04,432
The tall one seems infected, too.
She turned less tall. How does it work?

183
00:12:04,515 --> 00:12:09,353
She's not an <i>it. </i>She's my friend.
And what do you mean, infected?

184
00:12:09,437 --> 00:12:11,188
It's really fascinating.

185
00:12:11,272 --> 00:12:14,942
I've been experimenting with a disc
recovered from a mine.

186
00:12:15,025 --> 00:12:16,736
It was a game changer.

187
00:12:16,819 --> 00:12:20,781
It held more complete First Ones code
than anything I'd ever seen before.

188
00:12:20,865 --> 00:12:22,366
But it seems to have reacted

189
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:24,952
with the First Ones tech
that powers my bots.

190
00:12:25,035 --> 00:12:28,205
It infected them
with some sort of a virus.

191
00:12:28,289 --> 00:12:30,458
But why would that make She-Ra sick?

192
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:34,003
Well, I'd have to take her apart
to be sure.

193
00:12:34,545 --> 00:12:38,007
But since her sword is First Ones tech,
it must've spread through that.

194
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:41,635
First, you're not taking her apart.
She is a person!

195
00:12:41,719 --> 00:12:43,554
Second, if we destroy this disc,

196
00:12:43,637 --> 00:12:45,806
will that turn off the bots
and stop the virus?

197
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:48,768
Destroy it? The experiment isn't complete!

198
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:51,854
I think we can safely say
this experiment is a failure.

199
00:12:51,937 --> 00:12:55,107
But what if it's not?
No, you're right, it's a failure.

200
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:57,610
[grunts]

201
00:12:58,319 --> 00:12:59,153
Glimmer.

202
00:12:59,737 --> 00:13:01,238
There's two of you.

203
00:13:01,322 --> 00:13:02,823
That's nice.

204
00:13:03,574 --> 00:13:05,117
How are you feeling?

205
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:08,204
Just peachy. Why are we whispering?

206
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:11,749
-Sound activates the robots.
-What robots?

207
00:13:11,832 --> 00:13:15,503
-The ones that are attacking us!
-Oh, those robots.

208
00:13:15,586 --> 00:13:19,632
-Okay, I'm gonna take a nap.
-No, no, no. Stay awake.

209
00:13:19,715 --> 00:13:23,803
We have to go to Entrapta's lab
and destroy this disc thing,

210
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:28,641
-and then you'll be all better again.
-Better? I'm fine. I'm She-Ra.

211
00:13:28,724 --> 00:13:30,601
[laughing, then snorts]

212
00:13:31,852 --> 00:13:33,187
Hi, Glimmer.

213
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:36,774
Come on, we've gotta get to your lab.
She's getting worse.

214
00:13:50,246 --> 00:13:51,580
[grunting]

215
00:13:52,873 --> 00:13:53,749
[shouts]

216
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:55,501
[grumbles]

217
00:13:56,377 --> 00:13:57,211
[Adora laughs]

218
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:58,921
Hmm.

219
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:02,049
Aha!

220
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:04,343
[gasps]

221
00:14:06,595 --> 00:14:07,596
[grunting]

222
00:14:10,224 --> 00:14:15,145
Oh, we're here. I mean, of course
we're here. We were never lost.

223
00:14:16,021 --> 00:14:17,398
[humming]

224
00:14:17,773 --> 00:14:18,983
[yelling]

225
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:26,073
Wow. The door is infected, too.
It won't let us in.

226
00:14:26,156 --> 00:14:30,077
That is so smart. And awful.
We're all gonna die.

227
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:33,414
It's okay, I've got this one.
I'll just teleport into the lab.

228
00:14:33,497 --> 00:14:37,418
Ooh, teleportation.
How does that work? Tell me everything.

229
00:14:37,501 --> 00:14:41,589
Sure. Maybe later, when we're not facing
a robot uprising.

230
00:14:41,672 --> 00:14:42,840
It's a date.

231
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:48,262
-I'll be back.
-I'm just gonna wait here. Heh.

232
00:14:50,472 --> 00:14:52,892
[robots roaring and Glimmer shouting]

233
00:14:58,606 --> 00:15:02,151
That was not such a great plan.
The lab is very full of robots.

234
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:03,193
How did they look?

235
00:15:03,277 --> 00:15:06,363
Pretty evil. I couldn't get
anywhere near the disc.

236
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:09,950
[both screaming]

237
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:15,331
[all shouting]

238
00:15:15,414 --> 00:15:17,666
Oh, he's kind of cute. [shouts]

239
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:20,920
[grunts] Uh, guys? A little help?

240
00:15:21,003 --> 00:15:22,755
[screaming]

241
00:15:25,174 --> 00:15:26,967
-[tracker beeping]
-[all shouting]

242
00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:30,220
-Don't say it's more bots.
-No. That's Glimmer teleporting.

243
00:15:30,304 --> 00:15:34,266
I know where Glimmer and Adora are.
Uh-oh. That's not good.

244
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:35,643
We have to do something.

245
00:15:35,726 --> 00:15:38,437
-We have to save them.
-Oh, no, sir. No, thank you.

246
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:41,315
It's one thing to fight them off
out of necessity.

247
00:15:41,398 --> 00:15:43,192
But to seek out danger?

248
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:45,611
-It's madness. Pardon me.
-[groans]

249
00:15:45,694 --> 00:15:48,572
Look, they're princesses,
they have powers.

250
00:15:48,656 --> 00:15:50,032
I make baked goods.

251
00:15:50,115 --> 00:15:52,910
Sure, we don't have powers
like the princesses'.

252
00:15:52,993 --> 00:15:55,621
But that never stopped me
and it doesn't have to stop you.

253
00:15:56,121 --> 00:15:59,541
But you're a master archer.
We're ordinary people.

254
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:05,047
I'm a master archer who's out of arrows.
But that never stopped me, either.

255
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:07,633
You each have a skill
that only you can do,

256
00:16:07,716 --> 00:16:09,969
even if it doesn't come
from some magical jewel.

257
00:16:10,052 --> 00:16:14,723
You say you're just ordinary people?
I say you're warriors of the Rebellion!

258
00:16:15,599 --> 00:16:17,142
To the Rebellion!

259
00:16:20,062 --> 00:16:20,980
[both panting]

260
00:16:40,374 --> 00:16:41,250
[gasps]

261
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:42,876
[robots roaring]

262
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,753
[Glimmer and Entrapta grunting]

263
00:16:49,049 --> 00:16:53,721
Incredible development.
The bots seem to be working together.

264
00:16:53,804 --> 00:16:56,265
Right now, I think that's a bad thing.

265
00:16:56,348 --> 00:16:58,517
We need to find another way into the lab.

266
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,519
The air duct. We can use that.

267
00:17:04,773 --> 00:17:07,443
I don't suppose you have
any other magical powers

268
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:09,194
that could be useful right now?

269
00:17:09,278 --> 00:17:11,572
I don't have enough energy
to teleport us all.

270
00:17:11,655 --> 00:17:13,949
Not without leaving someone's legs behind.

271
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:16,243
I'll give up one of mine
if you give up one of yours.

272
00:17:16,326 --> 00:17:17,286
[robots roaring]

273
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:18,328
[shouting]

274
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:25,210
-[Bow] Ha, ha!
-Woo-hoo!

275
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:27,087
It's Bow.

276
00:17:27,171 --> 00:17:29,214
Yay, there's a rainbow.

277
00:17:32,801 --> 00:17:33,761
[grunting]

278
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:37,264
[grunting]

279
00:17:43,771 --> 00:17:44,772
[chuckles]

280
00:17:45,522 --> 00:17:47,983
-How you doing?
-I'm getting the hang of this.

281
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:49,651
[grunting and shouting]

282
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:57,242
-Nice.
-[chuckles]

283
00:18:01,205 --> 00:18:02,164
[Glimmer] Bow.

284
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:05,084
You're okay. I was so worried.

285
00:18:05,459 --> 00:18:07,795
Big fan of your work, Princess Entrapta.

286
00:18:07,878 --> 00:18:10,589
Maybe not this work exactly,
but your other work.

287
00:18:10,672 --> 00:18:12,508
[chuckles] Hi.

288
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:16,595
-[Adora] Hi.
-You okay, Adora?

289
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:20,099
Oh, yeah, sure, I'm totally... [snorts]

290
00:18:20,474 --> 00:18:23,060
Entrapta was experimenting
with First Ones tech

291
00:18:23,143 --> 00:18:25,479
and it infected all her machines
with some kind of virus.

292
00:18:25,562 --> 00:18:28,607
She-Ra's sword got infected,
and made Adora all...

293
00:18:30,859 --> 00:18:31,944
weird.

294
00:18:32,027 --> 00:18:34,655
I teleported into the lab.
But it's full of bots.

295
00:18:34,738 --> 00:18:38,367
Maybe with She-Ra we'd have a chance,
but without her it's hopeless.

296
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:41,954
We don't need She-Ra.
We can do this together.

297
00:18:42,037 --> 00:18:43,038
[chuckles]

298
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:53,382
Okay. Where's the disc?

299
00:18:57,136 --> 00:19:01,140
How fascinating.
It has completely protected itself.

300
00:19:01,223 --> 00:19:05,561
-We have to find a way to turn it off.
-Hey, guys, I found the bots.

301
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,148
Adora!

302
00:19:13,443 --> 00:19:14,486
-[screams]
-Shh.

303
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:17,197
-[Bow] Glimmer!
-We'll get your friends.

304
00:19:17,281 --> 00:19:19,908
You two, get that disc turned off.

305
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:21,160
Keep them busy.

306
00:19:23,078 --> 00:19:24,037
[all shouting]

307
00:19:25,289 --> 00:19:26,665
[grunting and shouting]

308
00:19:32,254 --> 00:19:34,339
We got your back, princesses.

309
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:39,303
[groaning]

310
00:19:40,095 --> 00:19:43,182
That's not gonna work.
How do we shut the computer down?

311
00:19:43,265 --> 00:19:44,933
Ha! The power conduit.

312
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:46,602
[both grunting]

313
00:19:48,228 --> 00:19:49,271
[Bow laughs]

314
00:19:59,448 --> 00:20:02,784
You dumb bots, you're going
the wrong way! Bow, watch out!

315
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:04,953
Uh, why isn't the computer turning off?

316
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:09,082
[laughs]
It's running on its own power now.

317
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:12,377
That's it. We need to get out of here
and burn this place to the ground.

318
00:20:12,461 --> 00:20:16,548
-Experiment officially failed.
-Wait, I have an idea.

319
00:20:16,632 --> 00:20:17,841
[screams]

320
00:20:20,802 --> 00:20:24,932
Now's your chance, sonic arrow.
I believe in you!

321
00:20:25,015 --> 00:20:26,183
[screeching]

322
00:20:39,655 --> 00:20:42,532
[gasps] Where am I? What's happening?

323
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:49,623
Thanks, former tall one and companions,
for saving our lives.

324
00:20:49,706 --> 00:20:53,460
I would be honored to join your Rebellion
and provide you with weapons.

325
00:20:54,461 --> 00:20:56,672
Thanks, guys. You saved us all back there.

326
00:20:56,755 --> 00:21:00,217
The Rebellion needs regular people now
more than ever.

327
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:01,343
-We are ready.
-Ha!

328
00:21:03,887 --> 00:21:06,765
So, maybe you had a point before.

329
00:21:06,848 --> 00:21:09,393
What? Sorry, I couldn't hear you.

330
00:21:09,476 --> 00:21:13,480
I think what Glimmer's trying to say
is that you were right,

331
00:21:13,563 --> 00:21:15,607
we can't always rely on our powers.

332
00:21:15,691 --> 00:21:18,735
Oh. Is that
what you were trying to say, Glimmer?

333
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:20,988
-That I was right?
-Yes.

334
00:21:21,071 --> 00:21:23,115
And my sonic arrow was a good idea?

335
00:21:23,198 --> 00:21:26,493
Yes, it was brilliant,
and you were totally right. Okay?

336
00:21:26,576 --> 00:21:28,620
If you hadn't come,
the bots would've gotten us.

337
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:31,873
And I didn't know
She-Ra could get sick like that.

338
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:34,126
-What if it happens again?
-It won't.

339
00:21:34,209 --> 00:21:36,962
We destroyed that evil,
She-Ra-hating disc.

340
00:21:37,045 --> 00:21:39,506
Good. I never wanna feel that way again.

341
00:21:39,589 --> 00:21:41,008
Thanks for saving us, Bow.

342
00:21:41,091 --> 00:21:45,053
All in a day's work
for Bow and his band of Kitchen Knights.

343
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:46,930
His Baking Brigade.

344
00:21:47,014 --> 00:21:50,392
Pastry Patrol. I'm still working that out.

345
00:21:50,475 --> 00:21:51,852
[both chuckle]

346
00:21:51,935 --> 00:21:57,524
Oh. Look at that rock just staring at us.
Boy, that rock really needs smashing.

347
00:21:57,607 --> 00:22:01,361
And since She-Ra's not sick anymore,
she should probably smash it.

348
00:22:01,445 --> 00:22:04,781
Ha, ha! What? It's practice.

349
00:22:04,865 --> 00:22:06,950
For the honor of Grayskull!

350
00:22:07,034 --> 00:22:07,993
[sighs]

351
00:22:10,203 --> 00:22:13,332
[Entrapta] Log. Day 105. 104? Eh.

352
00:22:13,415 --> 00:22:17,419
The last experiment hit a few bumps,
but it was not a total failure.

353
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:20,756
I made some important discoveries.

354
00:22:21,131 --> 00:22:24,426
The disc is way more powerful
than I ever imagined.

355
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:33,101
With a few adjustments, I'm sure
the next experiment will be a success.

356
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,111
[closing theme playing]
