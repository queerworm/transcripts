00:00:17,142 --> 00:00:18,852
This is awesome!

2
00:00:18,935 --> 00:00:22,272
I can't believe Mom agreed
to let you stay in Bright Moon.

3
00:00:22,355 --> 00:00:23,398
[guards whispering]

4
00:00:23,481 --> 00:00:25,108
Yeah, awesome.

5
00:00:25,191 --> 00:00:28,695
{\an8}Okay. You've seen the dining hall,
the throne room, the portrait hall.

6
00:00:28,778 --> 00:00:33,241
So, the last stop on our grand tour
is your new room!

7
00:00:33,742 --> 00:00:34,576
Ta-da!

8
00:00:35,326 --> 00:00:37,162
[gasps]

9
00:00:37,245 --> 00:00:42,167
Pretty standard. You got your vanity,
bathroom, crystals, bell pull,

10
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:47,589
{\an8}tea nook, more crystals, bed, desk,
and, of course, the waterfall.

11
00:00:48,757 --> 00:00:52,552
{\an8}-Is the waterfall for showering?
-Ha! Good one, Adora.

12
00:00:52,927 --> 00:00:55,472
{\an8}"Waterfall for showering." [laughs]

13
00:00:57,182 --> 00:00:59,642
{\an8}I'm right down the hall
if you need anything. Night.

14
00:00:59,726 --> 00:01:00,810
-Wait--
-[door closes]

15
00:01:02,145 --> 00:01:05,148
{\an8}Okay. This is different
than the Fright Zone,

16
00:01:05,231 --> 00:01:07,650
{\an8}but I'm sure I'll get the hang of this
in no time.

18
00:01:10,028 --> 00:01:10,987

No! Go back in, go back in!

[whispering] Glimmer? Glimmer?
I think I killed the bed. [shrieks]

33

[in normal voice]
Ma'am! I mean, Your Majesty. Sir!

34
00:02:07,585 --> 00:02:08,419
[coughs]

35
00:02:11,506 --> 00:02:14,008
So, uh... what are you doing up?

36
00:02:14,092 --> 00:02:17,971
When I feel the cares of the day
weighing upon me, I come here.

37
00:02:18,054 --> 00:02:21,057
-[Adora] Who is that?
-King Micah. My husband.

38
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:23,184
He built the Rebellion with me.

39
00:02:23,268 --> 00:02:27,105
And he was one of the first casualties
of the Horde.

40
00:02:27,939 --> 00:02:30,859
-Sorry. I didn't know.
-Adora.

41
00:02:30,942 --> 00:02:33,069
My daughter believes you can help us.

42
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:35,738
Glimmer has vouched for you
despite your background.

43
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:38,116
And because I greatly love my daughter,

44
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:39,868
I'm willing to give you a chance.

45
00:02:39,951 --> 00:02:41,786
Do not disappoint her.

46
00:02:44,414 --> 00:02:45,498
[Glimmer snoring]

-[gasps] Glimmer! Are you okay?
-What are you doing in here?

51
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:00,096
[sighs] I'm sorry.

52
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:01,639
I couldn't sleep in my room.

53
00:03:01,723 --> 00:03:04,434
I've never slept
without any other people around before.

54
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:08,313
And then I ran into your mom,
I think she doesn't like me.

55
00:03:08,396 --> 00:03:12,233
-What? My mom loves you.
-Yeah, sure. She loves She-Ra.

56
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:16,946
Mom can be a little intense, heh.

57
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:19,824
But our weekly meeting
with the Rebellion Generals is today.

58
00:03:19,908 --> 00:03:23,661
And you're invited. She wouldn't
have invited you if she didn't like you.

59
00:03:28,082 --> 00:03:29,792
Wow. Heh.

60
00:03:33,087 --> 00:03:36,758
-Come on. Meeting's about to start.
-Uh, the chairs are still empty.

61
00:03:36,841 --> 00:03:39,052
Those are for other Etherian Princesses.

62
00:03:39,135 --> 00:03:43,014
But none of them have been active members
of the Rebellion since I was a kid.

63
00:03:43,097 --> 00:03:47,894
The Rebellion had a big defeat years ago,
and most of the old princesses gave up.

64
00:03:47,977 --> 00:03:52,357
Now all the kingdoms keep to themselves.
And the new princesses do the same.

65
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:55,902
Other than Spinnerella and Netossa.
Hey, guys!

66
00:03:56,402 --> 00:03:58,821
[whispers]
We're not really sure what they do.

67
00:03:58,905 --> 00:03:59,906
Ah.

68
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:02,617
[gasping]

69
00:04:03,701 --> 00:04:06,454
What? What? I don't understand.

70
00:04:06,537 --> 00:04:08,790
This is not your chair.

71
00:04:08,873 --> 00:04:11,626
Sorry, first day. Won't happen again.

72
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:15,213
-What did I do?
-You sat in my dad's chair.

73
00:04:15,296 --> 00:04:18,341
Oh, I'm sorry.

74
00:04:20,385 --> 00:04:24,180
I've asked you here because I received
a distress call from Princess Perfuma.

75
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:26,224
The Horde is laying siege to her kingdom.

76
00:04:26,307 --> 00:04:29,686
She's asking Bright Moon
for assistance. General?

77
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:32,855
Perfuma's kingdom, Plumeria,
is located near the front lines.

78
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:34,691
The Horde has set up camp
in her territory,

79
00:04:35,149 --> 00:04:36,693
cutting off their main supply route.

80
00:04:36,776 --> 00:04:39,862
Bright Moon will provide food
and humanitarian aid.

81
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:42,031
-I have a better idea. We--
-Fight the Horde?

82
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:44,784
Glimmer, you propose this idea
every meeting.

83
00:04:44,867 --> 00:04:49,831
No! I was gonna say let's use
aggressive fist-to-face sparkles.

84
00:04:49,914 --> 00:04:52,667
I said, no, Glimmer. Now sit down.

85
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:53,710
[sighs]

86
00:04:54,335 --> 00:04:57,422
You should send me, Glimmer,
and Bow to lead the relief mission.

87
00:04:57,505 --> 00:04:59,215
Send me as She-Ra.

88
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:01,050
I'll make sure everyone gets there safely

89
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:03,219
and protect Bow and Glimmer
if the Horde attacks.

90
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:06,055
I promise, I won't disappoint you.

91
00:05:06,681 --> 00:05:08,266
[sighs] Very well.

92
00:05:08,349 --> 00:05:11,144
You will deliver food and supplies
to Plumeria.

93
00:05:11,227 --> 00:05:14,147
And under no circumstances
will you engage the Horde.

94
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:15,940
You leave at dawn.

95
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:20,028
[shouts] I give up! I give up!

96
00:05:20,361 --> 00:05:22,780
[grunts] Quit playing around, Kyle!

97
00:05:22,864 --> 00:05:27,744
-Where's Catra? She's supposed to be here.
-Not anymore, cadet Lonnie.

98
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:29,829
-Why aren't you dressed?
-[Kyle shouting]

99
00:05:29,912 --> 00:05:32,874
Oh, Lonnie, Lonnie, sweet dumb Lonnie.

100
00:05:34,792 --> 00:05:36,961
They made you Force Captain?

101
00:05:37,045 --> 00:05:38,296
Congrats, Catra!

102
00:05:38,379 --> 00:05:39,505
[shouting]

103
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:41,758
Hordak knows a good thing when he sees it.

104
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:45,970
Now that I'm in charge,
Shadow Weaver won't be the only one...

105
00:05:46,888 --> 00:05:47,889
Uh...

106
00:05:47,972 --> 00:05:49,307
[Kyle grunts]

107
00:05:55,271 --> 00:05:58,399
What do you need, Shadow Weaver?
Ooh, are you giving me my first mission?

108
00:05:58,483 --> 00:06:01,569
You will explain
how you lost Force Captain Adora.

109
00:06:01,652 --> 00:06:04,822
Ugh. I've told you everything I know
about Adora!

110
00:06:04,906 --> 00:06:10,745
I know you're lying. You have to be lying.
What happened to Adora? What did you do?

111
00:06:11,287 --> 00:06:12,455
What did I do?

112
00:06:12,538 --> 00:06:15,208
She left us! She left me!

113
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:18,086
You ever think Adora's not as loyal
as you thought?

114
00:06:18,169 --> 00:06:22,340
I will learn the truth, Catra,
even if I have to drag it...

115
00:06:22,423 --> 00:06:24,092
[Shadow Weaver shouting]

116
00:06:26,844 --> 00:06:28,096
Out of my way!

117
00:06:32,141 --> 00:06:34,102
[children laughing]

118
00:06:35,269 --> 00:06:39,399
Wow. Mom didn't say anything
about all the plants dying.

119
00:06:39,482 --> 00:06:42,902
I don't think she knows.
Wait, where's Adora?

120
00:06:43,986 --> 00:06:45,029
[grunts]

121
00:06:47,031 --> 00:06:49,909
Are you going to be She-Ra
the entire time we're here?

122
00:06:49,992 --> 00:06:52,203
I told Queen Angella I would.

123
00:06:52,286 --> 00:06:56,290
Besides, people like me better as She-Ra.
[chuckles] Could Adora do <i>this?</i>

124
00:06:56,374 --> 00:06:57,834
[grunting]

125
00:06:57,917 --> 00:07:01,546
Hmm. Yep. Very useful to our mission.

126
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:03,673
Hey, guys. What is that?

127
00:07:05,466 --> 00:07:08,511
-Must be coming from the Horde camp.
-You're here!

128
00:07:08,594 --> 00:07:11,472
Princess Perfuma. I'm Commander Glimmer.

129
00:07:12,056 --> 00:07:13,433
Ooh, I get a hat.

130
00:07:14,392 --> 00:07:15,560
[gasps]

131
00:07:21,065 --> 00:07:23,943
Oh, my. Everyone, come quick! It's...

132
00:07:24,026 --> 00:07:24,902
Oh, it's...

133
00:07:25,653 --> 00:07:27,572
It's... [shouts]

134
00:07:28,823 --> 00:07:31,784
Look! The universe has heard our pleas

135
00:07:31,868 --> 00:07:36,038
and sent the legendary She-Ra
to help us save our home.

136
00:07:41,252 --> 00:07:42,086
[clears throat]

137
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:44,630
We've heard about the blockade
and we've come to help.

138
00:07:46,799 --> 00:07:49,427
We brought food and supplies for you.

139
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:50,595
[whimpers]

140
00:07:51,846 --> 00:07:53,973
Welcome to Plumeria, She-Ra.

141
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:57,018
Um, Glimmer, what's happening?

142
00:07:57,101 --> 00:08:00,855
Come with me, I'll show you around.
You're gonna love it.

143
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:04,442
[baby cooing]

144
00:08:04,525 --> 00:08:08,738
Our people have lived here
in tranquility for thousands of years.

145
00:08:08,821 --> 00:08:12,992
We're known for our beautiful flowers,
our majestic trees.

146
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:18,122
And this is the Heart-Blossom,
the center of our kingdom,

147
00:08:18,206 --> 00:08:21,000
and the source of all my magical powers.

148
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:26,380
At least this tree is fine.
What happened to everything else?

149
00:08:26,464 --> 00:08:28,132
We're going through a little rough patch,

150
00:08:28,216 --> 00:08:30,885
but I'm sure the universe
will right itself soon.

151
00:08:30,968 --> 00:08:32,637
Everything is dead or dying.

152
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:35,431
Look, the blight hit
right after the Horde arrived.

153
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:38,643
We don't know why,
and nothing I do stops it.

154
00:08:38,726 --> 00:08:41,562
Be we don't dwell on the negative.
Look at the positive.

155
00:08:41,646 --> 00:08:45,316
The Heart-Blossom's still healthy,
and the She-Ra is here,

156
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:48,277
and the celebration's about to begin!

157
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:50,863
Celebration? [grunts]

158
00:08:54,784 --> 00:08:55,952
[groaning]

159
00:09:00,581 --> 00:09:03,668
[Shadow Weaver] You will not refuse me!

160
00:09:07,171 --> 00:09:09,715
-[Hordak] <i>Shadow Weaver.</i>
-Lord Hordak!

161
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:13,094
<i>You have disobeyed my orders.</i>

162
00:09:13,177 --> 00:09:17,598
I've done no such thing, Lord Hordak.
My will is your will.

163
00:09:17,682 --> 00:09:20,601
<i>Then explain to me</i>
<i>why you've requisitioned more troops</i>

164
00:09:20,685 --> 00:09:23,896
<i>to look for one missing soldier.</i>

165
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:26,899
<i>A soldier I ordered you to give up on.</i>

166
00:09:26,983 --> 00:09:29,735
Finding Adora is crucial to the Horde's--

167
00:09:29,819 --> 00:09:32,363
<i>Our mission</i>
<i>is to kill the Whispering Woods</i>

168
00:09:32,446 --> 00:09:34,699
<i>so we can finally march on Bright Moon.</i>

169
00:09:34,782 --> 00:09:40,121
<i>Our mission is to destroy the princesses</i>
<i>and their ridiculous Rebellion.</i>

170
00:09:40,204 --> 00:09:42,832
<i>You are distracted, Shadow Weaver.</i>

171
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:45,251
<i>Our ground troops</i>
<i>demand your full attention.</i>

172
00:09:45,334 --> 00:09:48,337
<i>The siege on Plumeria</i>
<i>has carried on for too long.</i>

173
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:52,008
<i>You will give the order to increase power</i>
<i>until victory is achieved.</i>

174
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:57,013
<i>And never forget,</i>
<i>I gave you your magical power</i>

175
00:09:57,096 --> 00:10:00,600
<i>and at my slightest whim,</i>
<i>I can take it away.</i>

176
00:10:01,142 --> 00:10:02,310
<i>Understand?</i>

177
00:10:02,852 --> 00:10:04,937
Of course, Lord Hordak.

178
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:09,108
[yells]

179
00:10:12,069 --> 00:10:15,698
No, it's okay.
You need this food more than we do.

180
00:10:15,781 --> 00:10:19,869
Nonsense.
It is our honor to serve the She-Ra.

181
00:10:22,747 --> 00:10:24,874
We are so honored to have you.

182
00:10:24,957 --> 00:10:28,210
-Whoa. That's She-Ra!
-I know. <i>The</i> She-Ra, right?

183
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:30,880
I'm so happy that
after all these centuries of being gone

184
00:10:30,963 --> 00:10:32,173
you've finally returned.

185
00:10:32,256 --> 00:10:34,050
I said break out the party kale.

186
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:37,303
And at our hour of greatest need,
just like in the stories.

187
00:10:37,386 --> 00:10:38,387
What stories?

188
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:41,390
The stories we've been telling
for thousands of years.

189
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:46,729
She-Ra, the warrior who tamed the beasts
of Beast Island with a single word.

190
00:10:46,812 --> 00:10:47,938
That's nothing.

191
00:10:48,022 --> 00:10:51,192
What about the time She-Ra defeated
a squad of Horde soldiers

192
00:10:51,275 --> 00:10:52,777
on a flying horse?

193
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:57,281
Or the time she saved Thaymor
from a legion of Horde soldiers?

194
00:10:57,365 --> 00:10:59,533
Or the time she borrowed my toothbrush

195
00:10:59,617 --> 00:11:02,703
and used it to defeat
an army of Horde soldiers.

196
00:11:03,621 --> 00:11:08,167
-Bow, that's not true.
-You're right. It was two armies!

197
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:09,627
[all cheering]

198
00:11:13,714 --> 00:11:14,799
Hey, calm down!

199
00:11:15,424 --> 00:11:16,884
Give her some space.

200
00:11:16,967 --> 00:11:18,969
One at a time. You first.

201
00:11:20,805 --> 00:11:23,641
-Oh! Thank you for the...
-Windchime.

202
00:11:23,724 --> 00:11:25,851
-Windchime.
-[explosion nearby]

203
00:11:28,771 --> 00:11:33,317
We're so excited for you to heal our land
and bring all the plants back to life.

204
00:11:33,401 --> 00:11:35,903
Will you be doing it
before the drum circle or after?

205
00:11:36,612 --> 00:11:39,281
-You want me to heal your land?
-Yes!

206
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:40,783
Like in the ancient story,

207
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:44,870
"She-Ra Heals The Forest
And Brings The Trees Back To Life."

208
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:48,582
I've seen her do way weirder stuff.
This'll be a snap.

209
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:52,628
Wait, it's not that simple.
Plus, I don't like the look of that smoke.

210
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:55,631
The Horde's up to something big.
We should investigate.

211
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:57,049
We?

212
00:11:59,176 --> 00:12:00,594
This is my power.

213
00:12:00,678 --> 00:12:01,971
I grow plants.

214
00:12:04,932 --> 00:12:07,935
We're not strong enough
to go up against the Horde.

215
00:12:08,018 --> 00:12:11,564
All we want is to live peacefully
in our ancestral home.

216
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:15,943
-And then She-Ra saved the day once again!
-[children laugh]

217
00:12:16,026 --> 00:12:17,486
We need you, She-Ra.

218
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:25,745
[all chanting] <i>She-Ra! She-Ra! She-Ra!</i>

219
00:12:26,454 --> 00:12:29,623
Yes, healing. That is a thing
I know how to do.

220
00:12:29,707 --> 00:12:32,543
I just need to take Bow and Glimmer
over to those trees for a moment.

221
00:12:33,002 --> 00:12:34,754
I know what I'm doing!

222
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:37,715
I don't know what I'm doing.
I can't heal anything!

223
00:12:37,798 --> 00:12:39,633
But the stories say
you have healing powers.

224
00:12:39,717 --> 00:12:42,928
They also say I fought the Mantisaur.
I don't even know what that is.

225
00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:45,723
Why don't you just concentrate
really hard?

226
00:12:45,806 --> 00:12:47,892
That seems to work
whenever you need to transform.

227
00:12:49,059 --> 00:12:50,019
Okay.

228
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:54,064
[grunting]

229
00:12:54,815 --> 00:12:57,818
-Did I do it?
-No, you punched a tree.

230
00:12:57,902 --> 00:13:01,322
-That's kind of the opposite of healing.
-Let me try again. [chuckles]

231
00:13:06,994 --> 00:13:08,913
-[grunts]
-[shrieks]

232
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:14,251
-Magic blast. Also not healing.
-I'll get it this time.

233
00:13:15,753 --> 00:13:16,587
[grunts]

234
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:19,173
[screeches]

235
00:13:19,924 --> 00:13:24,637
-Magical transformation?
-Wait, is that what happened to our horse?

236
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,347
[grunting]

237
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:27,556
[thudding]

238
00:13:32,186 --> 00:13:34,188
It's okay. You'll get it soon.

239
00:13:34,271 --> 00:13:38,526
Soon isn't good enough!
These people expect me to save their land.

240
00:13:38,609 --> 00:13:40,236
I thought I was better as She-Ra,

241
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:42,530
but I'm useless
no matter what form I take.

242
00:13:43,113 --> 00:13:44,615
[explosion nearby]

243
00:13:48,035 --> 00:13:49,370
-My hat!
-[Perfuma] She-Ra!

244
00:13:49,453 --> 00:13:52,623
Come quickly! Something
absolutely terrible has happened!

245
00:14:00,631 --> 00:14:04,969
The Heart-Blossom is dying.
Please, She-Ra, heal our land.

246
00:14:19,024 --> 00:14:21,694
Oh, come on, do something.

247
00:14:22,194 --> 00:14:23,696
[She-Ra grunting]

248
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:27,741
No.

249
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:30,244
-[sighs]
-[all gasping]

250
00:14:31,954 --> 00:14:37,001
-Sorry. I don't know how to heal.
-Who are you? Where's She-Ra?

251
00:14:37,084 --> 00:14:41,005
My name's Adora. I was chosen
to carry the sword of She-Ra,

252
00:14:41,088 --> 00:14:43,340
but I haven't been doing this
for very long, and...

253
00:14:43,424 --> 00:14:45,092
I don't know exactly how it works yet.

254
00:14:45,175 --> 00:14:46,844
She's just a girl!

255
00:14:46,927 --> 00:14:52,600
I never meant to deceive you.
I am She-Ra, I'm just not the same She-Ra.

256
00:14:52,683 --> 00:14:54,935
Then you can't save us?

257
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:57,187
-[explosion nearby]
-[all gasping]

258
00:15:00,691 --> 00:15:02,318
[all crying]

259
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:07,573
[Adora] Wait. There might be another way.

260
00:15:07,656 --> 00:15:12,494
I know the Horde. I think they're using
one of their machines to poison your land.

261
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:15,289
If we wanna save your home,
we have to stop them!

262
00:15:15,372 --> 00:15:17,958
You're not the She-Ra from the stories.

263
00:15:18,042 --> 00:15:22,004
-You were supposed to save us.
-It will be all right. I promise.

264
00:15:22,087 --> 00:15:23,422
We'll rebuild.

265
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:26,842
We have to believe the universe
will repay the Horde

266
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:28,677
for their evil deeds eventually.

267
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:33,140
The universe won't protect you!
You want She-Ra to fix everything,

268
00:15:33,223 --> 00:15:37,436
but won't even try to save yourselves?
At least Adora's trying.

269
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:40,856
If She-Ra can't save us, no one can.

270
00:15:41,523 --> 00:15:45,861
Right now, we just need to make sure
our people are safe. We leave today.

271
00:15:48,697 --> 00:15:51,867
-Are you okay?
-I just wanted to help.

272
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:56,121
But all I've done
is disappoint an entire kingdom.

273
00:15:56,205 --> 00:15:59,166
I'm sorry I let you guys down
after you talked me up.

274
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:03,671
We just wanted everyone to see
what an awesome person you are.

275
00:16:03,754 --> 00:16:07,383
I thought I was being supportive,
but I was actually being terrible!

276
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:12,388
Adora, She-Ra's not
the reason we like you.

277
00:16:12,471 --> 00:16:14,848
We like you because you're our friend.

278
00:16:15,057 --> 00:16:16,517
[explosion nearby]

279
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:21,480
You have a plan, don't you?

280
00:16:21,563 --> 00:16:23,357
Yeah. I think I do.

281
00:16:26,694 --> 00:16:27,528
All clear.

282
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:35,494
Okay, we need to find that machine.
Every Horde camp is laid out the same.

283
00:16:35,786 --> 00:16:37,746
Guard duty's always in half-hour shifts.

284
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:42,334
So we walk in when the shift changes,
in three, two, one.

285
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:44,086
-[woman] Shift change!
-[man] Finally!

286
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:46,714
I swear, boring shifts go by slower.

287
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:49,883
[gasps]

288
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:54,054
[gasps]

289
00:16:54,138 --> 00:16:55,055
You were right.

290
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:57,558
-The Horde is poisoning the land.
-[female guard] Hey!

291
00:16:57,641 --> 00:16:58,726
What are you doing here?

292
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:00,894
What are <i>you</i> doing here?

293
00:17:00,978 --> 00:17:03,313
We have security clearance,
password 5-echo-niner.

294
00:17:03,397 --> 00:17:04,815
Now be on your way.

295
00:17:04,898 --> 00:17:06,817
[guard] We haven't used
that password in months.

296
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:08,527
-Hands up!
-[alarm wailing]

297
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:11,155
-Adora? What do we do?
-Run!

298
00:17:12,489 --> 00:17:14,658
Hey, the Bright Moon guys left.

299
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:19,038
"We've gone to the Horde camp
to find the weapon killing your trees.

300
00:17:19,121 --> 00:17:22,166
If we don't make it,
I wanted to say I'm sorry.

301
00:17:22,249 --> 00:17:24,168
I couldn't be the hero you wanted.

302
00:17:25,002 --> 00:17:25,836
Adora."

303
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:34,011
She's still trying, even though
we were so negative. Glimmer was right.

304
00:17:34,094 --> 00:17:36,972
This is our home,
we can't let her do this alone!

305
00:17:37,639 --> 00:17:40,809
Everyone, She-Ra and our friends
from Bright Moon

306
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:43,687
are risking their lives
to protect us from the Horde.

307
00:17:43,771 --> 00:17:45,564
We need to help them!

308
00:17:45,647 --> 00:17:48,192
Get the warchimes, we march!

309
00:17:48,275 --> 00:17:50,110
[all cheering]

310
00:17:53,197 --> 00:17:54,114
[all shouting]

311
00:18:09,379 --> 00:18:14,218
-How many soldiers can you take?
-Between one and... zero.

312
00:18:15,177 --> 00:18:16,220
[panting] Whoo.

313
00:18:16,303 --> 00:18:21,517
[panting] I'll take them all,
if you give me a minute.

314
00:18:22,434 --> 00:18:23,644
[soldiers shouting]

315
00:18:28,398 --> 00:18:30,150
[horn wailing]

316
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:36,323
I always said the universe will repay
the Horde one day.

317
00:18:36,406 --> 00:18:38,325
Well, I guess that day is today!

318
00:18:39,409 --> 00:18:40,911
For the She-Ra!

319
00:18:40,994 --> 00:18:42,788
[all shouting]

320
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:47,960
Hey.

321
00:18:50,045 --> 00:18:51,672
Ooh. [chuckles]

322
00:18:52,297 --> 00:18:53,257
[grunts]

323
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:55,801
I've never been so alive!

324
00:18:56,885 --> 00:18:58,262
[grunting and shouting]

325
00:19:06,895 --> 00:19:09,857
For the honor of Grayskull!

326
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:35,132
[grunting and shouting]

327
00:19:43,891 --> 00:19:45,601
For Etheria!

328
00:19:59,781 --> 00:20:00,991
[shouts]

329
00:20:05,829 --> 00:20:07,331
[laughing]

330
00:20:10,918 --> 00:20:12,669
[woman] Ew! Yuck!

331
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:17,591
[man] Retreat! Retreat!

332
00:20:17,925 --> 00:20:19,801
Thank you so much!

333
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:24,890
You inspired us to save ourselves.
How can we ever repay you?

334
00:20:24,973 --> 00:20:28,644
Join the Rebellion
and help me reform the Princess Alliance.

335
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:32,898
Um, are you sure?
Didn't that go horribly the first time?

336
00:20:32,981 --> 00:20:37,569
It went horribly for our parents.
But we have a chance to do it right.

337
00:20:37,653 --> 00:20:39,696
We're clearly stronger together.

338
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:42,658
Think what all the princesses united
could do.

339
00:20:43,575 --> 00:20:46,745
Would I get to hit more people
with flowers?

340
00:20:46,828 --> 00:20:47,746
Absolutely.

341
00:20:47,829 --> 00:20:49,122
Then you have a deal.

342
00:20:49,206 --> 00:20:52,501
Hey, everyone! Look at us.
We're mighty rebels now!

343
00:20:52,584 --> 00:20:54,586
[all cheering]

344
00:20:58,966 --> 00:21:00,467
Force Captain Catra--

345
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:03,512
This was brought to me
by retreating soldiers,

346
00:21:03,595 --> 00:21:09,685
retreating because their camp
was attacked by Adora and She-Ra.

347
00:21:10,185 --> 00:21:13,272
Pathetic.
You're still trying to protect her.

348
00:21:13,355 --> 00:21:16,858
Did you think you could keep the truth
from me?

349
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:22,114
It's just a phase, she's confused.
I'll bring her back in, I swear.

350
00:21:22,197 --> 00:21:24,241
[Shadow Weaver] Oh, yes, you will.

351
00:21:24,324 --> 00:21:28,704
Because until I tell you otherwise,
that is your mission.

352
00:21:28,787 --> 00:21:32,582
And to ensure success,
no matter where Adora goes,

353
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:38,630
no matter how long it takes,
my shadow spies will find her.

354
00:21:38,714 --> 00:21:44,136
-[gasps]
-Find her and bring her home.

355
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:49,766
What is this? [chuckles]

356
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:53,186
Since you've never slept in a room
by yourself before,

357
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:56,690
Bow and I thought we'd throw a sleepover,
then you won't fell so alone.

358
00:21:56,773 --> 00:21:58,191
We even got you a new bed.

359
00:22:00,944 --> 00:22:02,571
It's wonderful.

360
00:22:03,196 --> 00:22:04,781
We can do this tomorrow too,

361
00:22:04,865 --> 00:22:07,284
since Glimmer's grounded
for ignoring orders.

362
00:22:07,367 --> 00:22:10,620
For one week!
Three weeks less than normal.

363
00:22:10,704 --> 00:22:12,789
And Mom said she'd consider my plan

364
00:22:12,873 --> 00:22:15,292
to recruit new princesses
into the Rebellion!

365
00:22:16,084 --> 00:22:17,085
Thanks, guys.

366
00:22:17,294 --> 00:22:20,589
I might not ever be the perfect hero
everybody wants me to be.

367
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:21,965
But that's okay. [grunts]

368
00:22:22,049 --> 00:22:27,304
Of course it's okay. Do you have any idea
how annoying you'd be if you were perfect?

369
00:22:27,387 --> 00:22:33,143
-Aw! Best Friend Squad!
-Yeah, we're not calling ourselves that.

370
00:22:33,226 --> 00:22:38,273
-I prefer "The Glimmer Group."
-Nah. We're the Best Friend Squad.

371
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,904
[closing theme playing]
