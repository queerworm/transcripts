00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:25,358
{\an8}-Hey, we made it.
-[Adora] Whoa.

00:00:25,442 --> 00:00:27,110
{\an8}Welcome to Bright Moon.

00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:30,405
[birds chirping

4
00:00:34,492 --> 00:00:36,286
{\an8}It's so beautiful.

5
00:00:36,369 --> 00:00:40,915
{\an8}Okay. I just need to go in there,
recharge and deal with my mom.

6
00:00:41,207 --> 00:00:42,417
{\an8}[groans]

7
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:43,752
This'll be fun.

8
00:00:44,461 --> 00:00:45,712
{\an8}Uh, Bow?

9
00:00:45,795 --> 00:00:48,673
{\an8}Maybe you should take Adora
in the back way?

10
00:00:48,757 --> 00:00:51,342
Oh, yeah. Good call.

11
00:00:51,426 --> 00:00:54,637
{\an8}What's the back way?
This is the back way?

12
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:58,349
{\an8}It might seem weird, but we
totally come in this way all the time.

13
00:00:58,433 --> 00:01:01,770
{\an8}Oh! Hey, here.
Why don't you put this robe on?

14
00:01:01,853 --> 00:01:04,314
-No reason.
-You're trying to hide me.

15
00:01:04,397 --> 00:01:06,775

-Where have you been?
-Hey, Mom.

27
00:01:51,277 --> 00:01:53,279
All of Bright Moon has been worried sick.

28
00:01:53,363 --> 00:01:54,948
-What were you thinking?
-Mom!

29
00:01:55,031 --> 00:01:57,700
How could you be so selfish
and disobedient?

30
00:01:57,784 --> 00:01:58,701
[groans]

31
00:01:58,785 --> 00:02:00,662
[gasps] Glimmer.

32
00:02:12,382 --> 00:02:13,383
[groaning]

33
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:18,596
Are you all right?

34
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:22,308
-I'm fine, Mom.
-Don't think you're not still in trouble.

35
00:02:22,392 --> 00:02:25,979
You didn't even take the time
to charge up before you left?

36
00:02:26,062 --> 00:02:28,398
I didn't think I'd be gone that long.

37
00:02:28,481 --> 00:02:30,733
-Where did you go, anyway?
-Okay.

38
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:33,987
Bow and I found a piece of super powerful
First Ones tech in the woods.

39
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:37,157
We knew it would help the Rebellion,
so we went to get it and bring it back,

40
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,575
but we got a little sidetracked.

41
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:40,660
It was fine though,
I totally had it under control.

42
00:02:40,743 --> 00:02:42,954
And while we were out,
we found something even better!

43
00:02:43,037 --> 00:02:44,205
What did you find?

44
00:02:44,289 --> 00:02:47,542
I can't tell you yet.
But you're gonna love it. I promise!

45
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:50,295
-Glimmer.
-Ah! Wait here, I'll be right back.

46
00:02:50,378 --> 00:02:53,590
We are not done talking about this,
Glimmer. Glimmer!

47
00:02:57,886 --> 00:02:59,512
Okay, I get it.

48
00:02:59,596 --> 00:03:02,223
I'm guessing the people of Bright Moon
are gonna be less welcoming

49
00:03:02,307 --> 00:03:04,684
of a Horde soldier
than you led me to believe.

50
00:03:04,767 --> 00:03:07,353
-Maybe a little.
-How little?

51
00:03:07,437 --> 00:03:10,481
-Think pitchforks and torches.
-[groans]

52
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:15,069
It's just that the people of Bright Moon
have been really hurt by the Horde.

53
00:03:15,153 --> 00:03:17,655
Everyone here has lost someone in the war.

54
00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:20,241
You can't blame them
for being a little suspicious.

55
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:21,701
Sorry.

56
00:03:21,784 --> 00:03:25,538
Hey, it's not your fault.
Once they get to know you,

57
00:03:25,622 --> 00:03:28,166
the people of Bright Moon
are going to trust you

58
00:03:28,249 --> 00:03:30,793
just like Glimmer and I already--
[shrieks]

59
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:33,838
I'm here! Okay,
my mom's on her way, but no one panic.

60
00:03:33,922 --> 00:03:35,715
-What?
-I said no one panic!

61
00:03:35,798 --> 00:03:36,966
Don't worry, she'll love you.

62
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:39,427
All you have to do is use the sword
to transform into She-Ra

63
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:40,720
before she gets here.

64
00:03:40,803 --> 00:03:43,640
Wait, we're jumping straight to She-Ra
with your mom?

65
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:44,891
-Are you sure?
-Yeah.

66
00:03:44,974 --> 00:03:46,100
My mom isn't going to buy,

67
00:03:46,184 --> 00:03:48,311
"Hey, Mom, we found a Horde soldier.
Can we keep her?"

68
00:03:48,394 --> 00:03:50,605
My mom is gonna love She-Ra.

69
00:03:50,688 --> 00:03:52,774
We can ease her
into the Horde stuff later.

70
00:03:52,857 --> 00:03:56,986
Uh, Glimmer, look. I don't know
if I can just turn on She-Ra.

71
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:59,197
I've only done it when someone was
in danger before,

72
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,574
and it felt a little
out of control last time.

73
00:04:01,658 --> 00:04:04,035
I'm still figuring out
how all of this stuff works.

74
00:04:04,118 --> 00:04:05,536
How hard can it be?

75
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:09,123
Sword, magic words, poof! She-Ra.

76
00:04:11,709 --> 00:04:15,463
Hey. You're gonna do great, okay?
Bow and I will go buy you some time.

77
00:04:15,546 --> 00:04:19,759
Just hang out here with the sword
and think She-Ra thoughts.

78
00:04:19,842 --> 00:04:21,552
-I believe in you.
-[grunts]

79
00:04:21,636 --> 00:04:25,640
Right. Okay, sword,
it's just you and me now. So...

80
00:04:25,723 --> 00:04:27,558
Let's do this. [chuckles]

81
00:04:27,642 --> 00:04:29,394
For the honor of Gray-- [shouting]

Horsey!

85
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:48,037
Oh! This is much better.

86
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:50,498
There's actually room to move around here.

87
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:53,126
Ready to see something cool?

88
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:56,546
For the honor of Grayskull!

89
00:05:01,634 --> 00:05:06,764
Okay, let's try that again.
For the honor of Grayskull!

00:05:07,849 --> 00:05:09,058

91
00:05:09,475 --> 00:05:10,643

[in deep voice]
For the honor of Grayskull!

93
00:05:13,896 --> 00:05:16,983
[in normal voice]
For the honor of Grayskull!

94
00:05:17,066 --> 00:05:18,484
[whispers] For the honor of Grayskull.

95
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:23,406
For the honor of Grayskull. [grunts]

96
00:05:23,489 --> 00:05:26,159
For the honor of Grayskull. [grunts]

97
00:05:28,077 --> 00:05:32,165
-Honor of Grayskull, blah, blah, blah.
-[horse blusters, neighs]

98
00:05:33,124 --> 00:05:37,086
Come on! Glimmer's counting on me.
Don't leave me hanging here.

99
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:40,340
For the honor of Grayskull!

100
00:05:46,721 --> 00:05:48,473
Horsey, no!

101
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:57,315
Okay.

102
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:03,112
[neighing]

103
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:04,906
Horsey, it's okay!

104
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:08,451
[crowd shouting]

105
00:06:08,576 --> 00:06:09,744
No! No, wait!

106
00:06:10,411 --> 00:06:11,245
Horsey!

107
00:06:13,748 --> 00:06:14,707
Stop!

108
00:06:16,667 --> 00:06:18,920
Horsey!

109
00:06:23,674 --> 00:06:24,717
Come back!

110
00:06:25,176 --> 00:06:26,469
[woman] Horde soldier.

111
00:06:26,552 --> 00:06:27,929
[chattering]

112
00:06:28,012 --> 00:06:29,514
Horde soldier!

113
00:06:29,597 --> 00:06:32,725
Wait, you don't understand. Stop!

114
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:35,978
I'm not with the Horde! Just listen!

115
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:38,231
[grunting and shouting]

116
00:06:43,611 --> 00:06:44,779
[woman 1] Go! Get her!

117
00:06:44,862 --> 00:06:47,198
-[woman 2] Don't let her get away!
-Move!

118
00:06:47,281 --> 00:06:48,366
[yells]

119
00:06:50,368 --> 00:06:51,369
[panting]

120
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:58,292
For the last time.

121
00:06:58,376 --> 00:07:02,338
What is this grand surprise
that I'm supposed to be so impressed with?

122
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:04,966
You'll see it in just a minute,
Mom, I promise.

123
00:07:05,049 --> 00:07:09,262
Bow, can you go check and make sure
that the surprise is ready for us?

124
00:07:09,345 --> 00:07:11,097
You got it, Princess.

125
00:07:12,348 --> 00:07:14,767
-I like that boy.
-I know you do, Mom.

126
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:17,770
You'll like this surprise even more.

127
00:07:17,854 --> 00:07:19,605
[chuckles]

128
00:07:23,151 --> 00:07:24,652
-So... problem.
-What?

129
00:07:24,735 --> 00:07:25,653
[woman] Your Majesty.

130
00:07:25,736 --> 00:07:28,156
A Horde spy has been discovered
on the Bright Moon grounds.

131
00:07:28,239 --> 00:07:29,699
She attacked our troops with a sword

132
00:07:29,782 --> 00:07:31,784
and then fled
with the help of a winged beast.

133
00:07:31,868 --> 00:07:35,788
What did you do?!

134
00:07:36,247 --> 00:07:39,292
[Lonnie] I'm telling you.
This new princess is no joke.

135
00:07:39,375 --> 00:07:42,462
She wiped the floor with our recon squad.

136
00:07:42,545 --> 00:07:44,213
Twelve feet tall at least!

137
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:47,800
Took out every one of our machines
with nothing but a sword.

138
00:07:47,884 --> 00:07:51,387
-Did you actually see her?
-No. And it's a good thing, too.

139
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:54,807
-We were lucky to get out of there alive.
-Oh, please.

140
00:07:55,349 --> 00:07:59,437
She's like every other princess:
All sparkle, no substance.

141
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,397
She caught us off-guard. That is all.

142
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:04,859
Sure. You were the only one
who saw her up close,

143
00:08:04,942 --> 00:08:07,236
and you didn't even land a hit on her.

144
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,655
-What? Did you freeze up?
-[growls]

145
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:11,949
You think I'm scared of some princess?

146
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:15,286
I could take her out whenever I want.
I know her secret.

147
00:08:15,369 --> 00:08:16,996
-[scoffs] Oh, yeah?
-[grunts]

148
00:08:18,122 --> 00:08:19,081
And what's that?

149
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:20,500
[growling]

150
00:08:25,254 --> 00:08:27,215
Hmm. Like I'd tell you.

151
00:08:27,632 --> 00:08:28,799
Easy, Catra.

152
00:08:29,217 --> 00:08:31,677
Adora's not here to protect you anymore.

153
00:08:34,263 --> 00:08:35,431
[panting]

154
00:08:39,435 --> 00:08:41,771
Stupid. You just had to go out there,

155
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:45,816
even after Bow warned you
about the pitchforks and torches.

156
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:46,734
[sighs]

157
00:08:48,277 --> 00:08:52,657
[scoffs] What do you want from me now?
Haven't I done enough for you?

158
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:55,243
For the honor of Grayskull.

159
00:08:56,911 --> 00:08:57,995
[sighs]

160
00:08:59,747 --> 00:09:02,375
-What's wrong with you?
-[metal clanging nearby]

161
00:09:06,504 --> 00:09:08,214
Horsey, is that you?

162
00:09:11,842 --> 00:09:13,594
[humming]

163
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:18,683
Did you hear something?
Yes, I did, too.

164
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:20,226
Who's there?!

165
00:09:21,102 --> 00:09:23,271
I, uh, didn't mean to intrude.

166
00:09:23,521 --> 00:09:25,982
Um, but have you seen
a flying horse around here?

167
00:09:27,358 --> 00:09:31,362
Oh, Mara, dearie, is that you?

168
00:09:31,904 --> 00:09:37,410
About time you got here. Come on now,
no time to waste. Let's get going.

169
00:09:38,202 --> 00:09:40,162
Uh, you were waiting for me?

170
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:44,250
[laughs] We made plans
to go berry-picking today.

171
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:47,712
I'm sorry, but I think you've mistaken me
for someone else.

172
00:09:47,795 --> 00:09:49,338
I don't know who you are.

173
00:09:50,381 --> 00:09:54,510
No, you don't know Madame Razz,
do you?

174
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:56,637
You're not quite the same.

175
00:09:56,721 --> 00:09:59,724
This is the wrong time for my Mara,
isn't it?

176
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:02,560
Now you've got the sword instead.

177
00:10:02,893 --> 00:10:04,270
Wait, what?

178
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,355
Ha! Well, never mind.

179
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:09,900
You're here now,
and there's berries to be picked.

180
00:10:10,735 --> 00:10:13,279
[Adora] Hey, uh,
you've said something about the sword.

181
00:10:13,362 --> 00:10:14,405
Have you seen it before?

182
00:10:14,488 --> 00:10:17,742
[Razz chuckles]
Don't ask such silly questions, Mara.

183
00:10:17,825 --> 00:10:20,995
You know you bring that sword around here
all the time.

184
00:10:21,495 --> 00:10:23,039
I'm not-- Okay.

185
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:26,500
How long have you been living
out here in the woods alone?

186
00:10:26,584 --> 00:10:27,960
Alone? Me?

187
00:10:28,044 --> 00:10:30,838
Oh, no. I'm not alone.

188
00:10:30,921 --> 00:10:34,175
I've got Broom here,
and my friend Loo-Kee too,

189
00:10:34,258 --> 00:10:36,093
but he's always hiding.

190
00:10:36,177 --> 00:10:37,345
[chuckles]

191
00:10:37,428 --> 00:10:41,182
[chuckles nervously]
Oh, good, she's got imaginary friends.

192
00:10:45,936 --> 00:10:46,979
Whoa.

193
00:10:47,438 --> 00:10:49,273
Ah! Here we are.

194
00:10:49,357 --> 00:10:51,859
I think I've seen a place
like this before.

195
00:10:52,818 --> 00:10:54,904
This is a First Ones ruin, isn't it?

196
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:58,157
And the best place to pick fresh berries!

197
00:11:00,368 --> 00:11:03,621
Hey, be careful up there!
That thing's not safe.

198
00:11:03,704 --> 00:11:04,664
[grunting]

199
00:11:12,838 --> 00:11:13,673
[yells]

200
00:11:20,721 --> 00:11:25,017
[chuckles] Oh, dearie me.
That was quite a tumble, eh?

201
00:11:30,064 --> 00:11:31,190
Stars?

202
00:11:31,482 --> 00:11:34,610
Oh. We used to come here
to look at the stars.

203
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:37,947
Do you remember, Mara?
They're all gone now.

204
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:40,157
What happened to the stars?

205
00:11:40,241 --> 00:11:44,036
I've seen them before.
I know all of this somehow.

206
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:50,292
[baby giggling]

207
00:11:58,342 --> 00:12:00,845
What is this?
What's happening to me?

208
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,849
Look, I know you brought me here
for a reason.

209
00:12:04,932 --> 00:12:09,186
If you know something about the sword,
about me, you need to tell me!

210
00:12:10,146 --> 00:12:15,276
I brought you here to pick berries,
and your basket's still empty.

211
00:12:15,359 --> 00:12:16,861
So, come on, silly.

212
00:12:18,904 --> 00:12:19,947
Whoa!

213
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:32,042
[grunts]

214
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:37,882
[shouting]

215
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:54,231
-[Shadow Weaver] Catra!
-What do you want?

216
00:12:54,315 --> 00:12:57,067
Impertinent as always, I see.

217
00:12:57,151 --> 00:12:59,987
With such a grand failure under your belt,

218
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:03,741
it would benefit you
to show more respect, cadet.

219
00:13:03,824 --> 00:13:06,035
I did what you told me to do.

220
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:08,913
You are the one who didn't warn us
there would be princesses there.

221
00:13:08,996 --> 00:13:12,374
I gave you a simple task:
bring back Adora.

222
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:14,502
Instead, your squadron is ravaged,

223
00:13:14,585 --> 00:13:18,672
your war machines destroyed,
and Adora is still missing.

224
00:13:18,756 --> 00:13:24,011
News flash, old lady, if Adora wanted
to come home, she'd be here right now.

225
00:13:24,094 --> 00:13:26,388
Adora's gone. She defected.

226
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:28,599
And I'm starting to think
she had the right idea.

227
00:13:28,682 --> 00:13:33,187
So maybe it's you who should be showing
a little more respect to me.

228
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:34,396
[Shadow Weaver] Lies!

229
00:13:36,148 --> 00:13:38,734
I am out of patience
to address your incompetence

230
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:40,820
and your insubordination, cadet.

231
00:13:40,903 --> 00:13:44,615
You will answer to a higher power,

232
00:13:44,698 --> 00:13:46,951
Lord Hordak himself.

233
00:13:50,913 --> 00:13:53,916
[grumbles] Wait! Will you slow down?

234
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:55,793
Eh? What's that, dearie?

235
00:13:55,876 --> 00:13:58,254
I don't have my glasses,
you'll have to speak up.

236
00:13:58,337 --> 00:14:02,174
Oh, I know you can hear me. I just--
I need you to tell me what to do!

237
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:05,761
[laughing] How would Madame Razz know
what you should do?

238
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:08,472
Look, I left my whole life behind,
looking for answers

239
00:14:08,556 --> 00:14:11,642
about where I came from
and who I'm supposed to be.

240
00:14:11,725 --> 00:14:14,311
The Rebellion hates me,
and I can't go back to the Horde.

241
00:14:14,395 --> 00:14:18,816
And I wanna do the right thing,
but I don't know what that is.

242
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:34,874
[gasps]

243
00:14:37,084 --> 00:14:40,629
Ah. It's the same old story, dearie.

244
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:44,300
Wicked people destroy
what they cannot control.

245
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:46,302
They can't just do this.

246
00:14:46,802 --> 00:14:49,471
Once, the princesses would have
protected us.

247
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:51,307
But these days, they--

248
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:55,477
they stay in their castles,
protecting only their own lands.

249
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:58,814
Meanwhile, the Horde creeps ever closer.

250
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:02,484
You're very like my Mara, you know?

251
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:06,447
Brave, loyal, but afraid.

252
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:07,740
I'm not afraid.

253
00:15:07,823 --> 00:15:10,576
Dearie... [chuckles]
you ran into the woods

254
00:15:10,659 --> 00:15:14,455
and asked the first old lady
you could find what you should do.

255
00:15:14,538 --> 00:15:17,416
No one is going
to make this easy for you, dearie.

256
00:15:17,499 --> 00:15:21,754
Stop waiting for someone
to tell you what the right thing to do is.

257
00:15:21,837 --> 00:15:23,380
You're a smart girl.

258
00:15:23,464 --> 00:15:25,049
What do you think?

259
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:28,761
I think... this is wrong.

260
00:15:28,844 --> 00:15:30,220
[horse neighing]

261
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:33,223
-Horsey.
-Huh?

262
00:15:54,662 --> 00:15:56,914
For the honor of Grayskull.

263
00:16:24,108 --> 00:16:26,026
Keep those lines taut.

264
00:16:28,028 --> 00:16:29,363
[grunts]

265
00:16:29,446 --> 00:16:30,906
[neighing]

266
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:35,244
Turn off your machines
and leave this place now!

267
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:37,830
It's the Princess. Get her!

268
00:16:39,915 --> 00:16:41,250
[grunting and shouting]

269
00:16:58,892 --> 00:17:00,060
Huh? Uh...

270
00:17:03,647 --> 00:17:05,149
[grunting and shouting]

271
00:17:06,608 --> 00:17:08,193
That's my girl.

272
00:17:08,277 --> 00:17:09,445
[laughs]

273
00:17:10,654 --> 00:17:11,905
She-Ra!

274
00:17:15,451 --> 00:17:17,536
Take that, you great lump!

275
00:17:17,619 --> 00:17:19,788
<i>Razzle Dazzle!</i>

276
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:22,499
Razz, no! You can't be here.

277
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:25,252
[neighs]

278
00:17:27,129 --> 00:17:28,756
Woo-hoo!

279
00:17:43,228 --> 00:17:44,605
Mara, dear.

280
00:17:44,688 --> 00:17:45,606
Yeah!

281
00:17:47,191 --> 00:17:49,359
[Horde soldiers shouting]

282
00:17:52,362 --> 00:17:54,782
<i>Razzle Dazzle!</i>

283
00:17:58,452 --> 00:17:59,828
[horse whinnies]

284
00:18:01,538 --> 00:18:03,540
Hello, dearie.

285
00:18:04,374 --> 00:18:05,209
Ow.

286
00:18:05,292 --> 00:18:08,337
Swift Wind and I have been talking
while you were asleep.

287
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:10,631
He thanks you for coming to his rescue.

288
00:18:10,714 --> 00:18:13,592
-Swift Wind?
-That's what he prefers to be called.

289
00:18:13,675 --> 00:18:16,220
Also, he wanted me to make sure
that you know

290
00:18:16,303 --> 00:18:18,764
that "Horsey" was a stupid name.

291
00:18:19,139 --> 00:18:22,226
-How do you feel?
-I'm... I'm okay.

292
00:18:22,309 --> 00:18:25,354
I think I know what I need to do.

293
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:29,608
If the princesses won't defend Etheria,
then I will.

294
00:18:29,691 --> 00:18:33,779
-I need to get back to Bright Moon.
-Ah, that's the spirit, dearie.

295
00:18:33,987 --> 00:18:36,824
-Will I see you again?
-If you need me,

296
00:18:36,907 --> 00:18:39,910
you will always know where to find me.

297
00:18:41,703 --> 00:18:43,122
Who was that girl?

298
00:18:43,664 --> 00:18:48,335
Um... Any chance I can get a ride back
to Bright Moon, Swift Wind?

299
00:18:50,295 --> 00:18:51,630
Please?

300
00:18:52,297 --> 00:18:53,132
[whinnies]

301
00:18:54,258 --> 00:18:55,384
[laughing]

302
00:18:55,467 --> 00:18:56,760
[Swift Wind neighing]

303
00:18:56,844 --> 00:19:00,139
[Adora] Woo-hoo! [laughs]

304
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:05,394
[Angella] How could you possibly think
this was acceptable?!

305
00:19:05,477 --> 00:19:08,730
[Glimmer] Mom, you don't understand.
You're not listening!

306
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:11,150
[Angella] You've shown
remarkably poor judgment!

307
00:19:11,233 --> 00:19:15,279
Allowing a Horde soldier into Bright Moon
without telling me?

308
00:19:15,362 --> 00:19:17,906
Your Majesty, it's not all her fault.

309
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:22,703
Bow, I think it is time you went home.
Glimmer and I have a lot to discuss.

310
00:19:22,786 --> 00:19:23,620
Mom!

311
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:27,791
[all gasp]

312
00:19:37,593 --> 00:19:41,513
-It can't be.
-I was trying to tell you. Mom, meet--

313
00:19:41,597 --> 00:19:42,431
She-Ra.

314
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:48,187
Your Majesty, I've come to pledge myself
to the Rebellion.

315
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:50,898
But first,
there's something you should know.

316
00:19:53,108 --> 00:19:54,026
[all gasp]

317
00:19:54,109 --> 00:19:57,738
-[woman] She's a Horde soldier.
-Mom, this is Adora.

318
00:19:59,364 --> 00:20:02,242
I know you have no reason to trust me,
Your Majesty.

319
00:20:02,326 --> 00:20:05,579
But I've seen for myself the atrocities
the Horde has committed

320
00:20:05,662 --> 00:20:09,291
against the people of Etheria,
and I'm ready to fight to stop them.

321
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:10,876
If you give me the chance,

322
00:20:10,959 --> 00:20:14,379
I know I can help the Rebellion
turn the tide of the war.

323
00:20:22,804 --> 00:20:26,558
[Angella] I know the legend of the warrior
the First Ones called She-Ra.

324
00:20:26,642 --> 00:20:29,853
They said she would return to us
in the hour of our greatest need

325
00:20:29,937 --> 00:20:31,813
to bring balance to Etheria.

326
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:33,982
I never thought
she was anything more than a myth.

327
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:35,234
And yet you're here now.

328
00:20:35,317 --> 00:20:38,487
And in the uniform
of a Horde soldier, no less.

329
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:42,616
You would pledge to stand with us
against those you once served?

330
00:20:42,699 --> 00:20:44,743
[sighs] Yes.

331
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:48,997
Glimmer, you would vouch for her
and take responsibility for her?

332
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:49,915
Yes.

333
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:51,416
Then rise.

334
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:56,755
The Rebellion accepts your allegiance,
She-Ra, Princess of Power.

335
00:20:59,132 --> 00:21:01,927
[all chanting] <i>She-Ra! She-Ra! She-Ra!</i>

336
00:21:02,594 --> 00:21:06,848
-[shouts] Welcome to Bright Moon!
-But for real this time.

337
00:21:19,653 --> 00:21:21,697
[squeaking]

338
00:21:24,241 --> 00:21:25,492
Lord Hordak.

339
00:21:31,498 --> 00:21:32,666
Kneel!

340
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:35,544
I gave her charge of a simple mission:

341
00:21:35,627 --> 00:21:39,047
To return Force Captain Adora
to the Fright Zone.

342
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:43,593
Instead, our forces suffered
a humiliating defeat.

343
00:21:43,677 --> 00:21:48,640
[Hordak] Then you mean to tell me
you're still down a Force Captain?

344
00:21:48,724 --> 00:21:51,018
Yes, my lord. But rest assured,

345
00:21:51,101 --> 00:21:55,230
nothing will stop us from finding Adora
and bringing her back.

346
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:59,067
[Hordak] No. You will elect
another Force Captain

347
00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:01,194
and resume normal operations.

348
00:22:01,278 --> 00:22:05,699
[Shadow Weaver] But, my lord,
Adora is the only viable candidate.

349
00:22:05,782 --> 00:22:09,286
[Hordak] You have Catra.
Was she not your ward as well?

350
00:22:09,369 --> 00:22:12,080
[Shadow Weaver] Catra has been
nothing but a disappointment to me.

351
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:14,666
[Hordak] If you have failed
to condition her properly,

352
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:17,294
you have no one but yourself to blame.

353
00:22:17,377 --> 00:22:19,421
-[Shadow Weaver] But, my lord--
-[Hordak] Enough.

354
00:22:19,504 --> 00:22:24,051
I have made my decision.
Rise, Force Captain Catra.

355
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:34,269
Hmm.
