{\an8}Hello? [echoing]

3
00:01:08,568 --> 00:01:10,862
I carry the sword of She-Ra,

4
00:01:10,945 --> 00:01:13,865
and I've come here for help.
Is anyone there?

<i>Greetings, administrator.</i>
<i>What is your query?</i>

6
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:20,497
Oh. I need your help to heal my friend.

7
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:23,124
She's been cursed.
I don't know how to save her.

8
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:26,961
The legends say that She-Ra
could heal people using this sword.

9
00:01:27,045 --> 00:01:28,254
How do I do that?

10
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:31,633
<i>What is your query?</i>

11
00:01:33,218 --> 00:01:34,928
Not this again. [scoffs]

12
00:01:36,638 --> 00:01:39,057

Light Hope. That's her name, isn't it?

for the first time. Where is she?

Why are those things trying to kill us?

65
00:04:44,742 --> 00:04:48,204
They're trying to kill you.
This place sees you as an invader.

66
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:50,456
Well, can't you tell them to stop?

67
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:54,919
No, I can't tell them to stop. Clearly,
nothing in here is listening to me!

You shouldn't be here, Catra.

Those things aren't gonna stop
until they get you,

74
00:05:18,276 --> 00:05:20,737
and since I'm protecting you,
they see me as a threat, too.

Uh, good thing I didn't ask you
to protect me.

Wait, you know, what--
Okay. Why are you here anyway?

77

How did you find this place?

78
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:32,874
It sent up a beam of light a mile high.
It wasn't hard.

79
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:36,836
Does Shadow Weaver know you're here?

80
00:05:36,919 --> 00:05:40,214
I'd say Shadow Weaver's
got bigger problems right now.

81
00:05:40,798 --> 00:05:46,304
Why are you looking at me like that?
Wait. No. I know what this is about.

82
00:05:46,387 --> 00:05:49,307
Ugh, I knew you'd be weird
about me letting you escape.

83
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:51,225
I told you, it's not because I like you.

84
00:05:51,309 --> 00:05:53,311
I mean, I didn't-- I didn't say anything.

85
00:05:53,394 --> 00:05:55,271
Anyway, what are you doing out here?

86
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:58,733
Where are your new best friends?
I thought you did everything together.

87
00:05:58,816 --> 00:05:59,942
Oh, my friends?

88
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:02,403
The ones you kidnapped
and held for ransom?

89
00:06:02,487 --> 00:06:05,239
The ones you let Shadow Weaver
imprison and curse?

90
00:06:05,323 --> 00:06:07,992
Yeah, obviously. What other friends
would I be talking about?

91
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:10,870
Come on. Those things will be back
any minute, we need to get out.

92
00:06:10,953 --> 00:06:12,914
Well, we don't need to go together.

93
00:06:12,997 --> 00:06:15,333
You do your weird
little magic quest thing,

94
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:16,959

Cool, you found
the Infinite Darkness Room.

101
00:06:59,001 --> 00:07:01,379
Have fun, I'm gonna find
another way around.

102
00:07:02,547 --> 00:07:05,091
Uh... Where did the door go?

103
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:11,013
Wait, I think I see something.
Hello? Light Hope?

104
00:07:14,684 --> 00:07:16,310
-What's--?
-[both shout]

105
00:07:19,063 --> 00:07:19,897
Huh?

106
00:07:25,027 --> 00:07:27,697
-What game are you playing?
-Whoa, whoa.

107
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:29,323
I have no idea what's going on.

108
00:07:29,407 --> 00:07:31,576
There's no way we can be
in the Fright Zone.

109
00:07:31,659 --> 00:07:34,245
So what is this?
Another Shadow Weaver mind trick?

110
00:07:34,328 --> 00:07:37,039
I doubt it. Now let go of me.

111
00:07:45,381 --> 00:07:46,966
Hey, you! Guard!

00:07:48,551 --> 00:07:50,344

-Catra?

116

-Shh.

118
00:08:12,783 --> 00:08:17,205
-[grunts] Does it look broken to you?
-It's not broken. You're fine.

119

-[shrieks] I'm bleeding!
-You're not bleeding!

120
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:24,128
Why would you try and pick a fight
with Octavia anyway?

121
00:08:24,212 --> 00:08:27,798
I didn't do anything.
All I did was exist near her.

122
00:08:27,882 --> 00:08:31,302
And scratch her on the eyeball.
And call her a dumb-face.

123
00:08:31,385 --> 00:08:34,514
-Catra--
-What? She has a dumb face.

124
00:08:34,597 --> 00:08:35,556
Where is she?

[both laughing]

129
00:08:58,996 --> 00:09:00,414
What was that?

130
00:09:00,748 --> 00:09:05,378
It must have been some kind of simulation.
It's tapping into our memories.

131
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:07,421
Why, I have no idea.

132
00:09:07,505 --> 00:09:09,799
Ugh. This place is so weird.

133
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:12,552
How can you deal
with all of this magic stuff?

134
00:09:12,635 --> 00:09:15,763
I'm only dealing with it because I need
to figure out how to heal Glimmer

135
00:09:15,846 --> 00:09:17,932
after someone got her cursed.

136
00:09:18,015 --> 00:09:21,394
What do you want? An apology?
You're not getting one.

137
00:09:24,438 --> 00:09:27,233
-Can I ask you something?
-[groans] Can I stop you?

138
00:09:27,316 --> 00:09:28,568
[both gasp]

139
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:34,365
Why did you help me escape
after Shadow Weaver captured us?

140
00:09:34,448 --> 00:09:35,575
Not this again.

141
00:09:36,117 --> 00:09:37,952
It's the one thing I can't figure it out.

142
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:39,912
You didn't have to do that.

143
00:09:40,329 --> 00:09:43,499
You could've gotten caught.
Why risk it? Whoa, whoa, whoa!

144
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:48,754
Did you really think
I'd just let Shadow Weaver

145
00:09:48,838 --> 00:09:49,839
erase your memory?

146
00:09:50,214 --> 00:09:52,049
I don't know. Probably.

147
00:09:52,133 --> 00:09:54,760
Yeah, well...
You never did have too much faith in me.

148
00:09:54,844 --> 00:09:56,512
[sighs] Can you blame me?

149
00:09:57,179 --> 00:09:58,347
[chuckles] Not really.

150
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:04,186
It wasn't all bad growing up
in the Fright Zone, was it?

151
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:07,023
I mean, you still have
some good memories, right?

152
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,566
Of course I do.

153
00:10:08,649 --> 00:10:11,986
But it doesn't change the fact
that the Horde is evil.

154
00:10:12,069 --> 00:10:14,614
I had no choice. I couldn't go back.

155
00:10:18,701 --> 00:10:20,661
Hey, I miss you, too.

156
00:10:20,745 --> 00:10:24,206
Wha--? [scoffs] I don't miss you.
Get over yourself.

157
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:26,459
Not until you admit you like me.

158
00:10:26,542 --> 00:10:28,294
-I don't like you.
-[laughs]

[grumbles]

171
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:31,524
Good work, cadet. I like your focus.

172
00:11:31,607 --> 00:11:35,069
This win will definitely be reported back
to Lord Hordak.

173
00:11:36,737 --> 00:11:38,989
What was that? Way to gang up on me.

174
00:11:39,073 --> 00:11:40,449
You were fighting dirty.

175
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:44,412
-I was just leveling the field.
-Hey, you were awesome.

176
00:11:44,495 --> 00:11:46,497
-Did I hurt you?
-No, I'm fine.

177
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:48,249
You're just lucky I let you win.

178
00:11:48,332 --> 00:11:50,418
-Right.
-I'm serious.

179
00:11:50,501 --> 00:11:54,839
If I came in first, people might
expect me to actually start doing stuff.

180
00:11:54,922 --> 00:11:58,092
Trust me, second place suits me just fine.

181
00:11:58,175 --> 00:11:59,593
Yeah, okay.

182
00:11:59,677 --> 00:12:02,763
-Come on, let's cool down.
-In a minute, I'll meet you there.

183
00:12:02,847 --> 00:12:04,348
Hey, guys, wait up!

184
00:12:04,432 --> 00:12:07,017
-[all laughing]
-So cool. Yeah.

185
00:12:19,196 --> 00:12:20,781

186
00:12:22,116 --> 00:12:23,117

[Catra screaming nearby]

189
00:12:40,134 --> 00:12:41,969
Catra? Catra!

190
00:12:44,221 --> 00:12:45,681
[both grunting]

191
00:12:52,813 --> 00:12:53,647
Catra!

192
00:13:02,698 --> 00:13:04,158
[muffled] Adora!

193
00:13:06,952 --> 00:13:08,454
[screaming]

194
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:15,628

[shouts]

197
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:44,615
Are you okay?

198
00:13:46,408 --> 00:13:48,786
-I had it.
-Sure you did.

199
00:13:48,869 --> 00:13:52,373
-We need to make sure we stay together.
-Will you stop telling me what to do?

200
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:58,128
I'm sick of this stupid place.
Let's just get out of here.

201
00:14:00,798 --> 00:14:03,300
What is your problem?
I was trying to save you.

202
00:14:03,634 --> 00:14:06,136
For the last time,
I don't need you to save me.

203
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:09,348
I've been doing just fine on my own.
No thanks to you.

204
00:14:09,431 --> 00:14:10,808
Catra, wait.

205
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:13,519
I'm sorry for leaving.

206
00:14:13,602 --> 00:14:15,354
I couldn't go back to the Fright Zone.

207
00:14:15,437 --> 00:14:17,982
Not after I saw what the Horde
was really doing.

208
00:14:18,065 --> 00:14:20,317
I never wanted to leave you.

209
00:14:20,401 --> 00:14:23,487
You could come with me,
you could join the rebellion.

210
00:14:23,571 --> 00:14:27,825
I know you're not a bad person, Catra.
You don't belong with the Horde.

211
00:14:27,908 --> 00:14:28,742
[door opens]

212
00:14:31,495 --> 00:14:33,539
Let's just get this over with.

213
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:36,917
[grunting]

214
00:14:39,336 --> 00:14:40,629
Catra, wait up!

215
00:14:42,256 --> 00:14:45,426
What's it like
being the world's slowest person?

216
00:14:46,176 --> 00:14:47,261
[crashing]

217
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:49,305
[both laughing]

218
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:53,767
Whoa.

219
00:14:53,851 --> 00:14:58,272
-[Catra gasps] It's open.
-We're definitely not allowed in there.

220
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:01,275
[both laughing]

221
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:04,945
You don't have to go in there.

222
00:15:10,659 --> 00:15:11,619
[young Catra] Whoa.

223
00:15:14,788 --> 00:15:16,040
Wow.

224
00:15:19,877 --> 00:15:21,086
[shrieks]

225
00:15:21,337 --> 00:15:24,465
-Maybe we should get out of here.
-[Shadow Weaver groaning]

226
00:15:45,027 --> 00:15:45,945
[gasps]

227
00:15:49,031 --> 00:15:49,990
[gasps]

228
00:15:50,074 --> 00:15:51,992
-[Catra gasps]
-[Shadow Weaver] Get out!

229
00:15:54,828 --> 00:16:00,751
Catra, you stay.
What do you think you're doing in here?

230
00:16:04,004 --> 00:16:06,674
-We were just playing.
-[Shadow Weaver] Insolent child.

231
00:16:06,757 --> 00:16:11,470
I've come to expect
such disgraceful behavior from you.

232
00:16:11,553 --> 00:16:16,266
But I will not allow you
to drag Adora down as well.

233
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:19,186
Shadow Weaver, it wasn't her fault,
it was my idea, too.

234
00:16:19,269 --> 00:16:22,773
[Shadow Weaver] You have never been
anything more than a nuisance to me.

235
00:16:22,856 --> 00:16:26,777
I've kept you around this long
because Adora was fond of you.

236
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:30,239
But if you ever do anything to jeopardize
her future,

237
00:16:30,322 --> 00:16:33,450
I will dispose of you myself.

238
00:16:33,534 --> 00:16:35,953
Do you understand?

239
00:16:36,036 --> 00:16:37,204
Please, stop.

240
00:16:39,289 --> 00:16:40,624
[Shadow Weaver groans]

241
00:16:42,793 --> 00:16:45,337
-She didn't mean to.
-Adora.

242
00:16:45,421 --> 00:16:50,217
You must do a better job
of keeping her under control.

243
00:16:50,884 --> 00:16:54,388
Do not let something like this
happen again.

244
00:17:00,561 --> 00:17:03,439
[grunts] You always need
to play the hero, don't you?

245
00:17:03,814 --> 00:17:05,816
I was only trying to protect you.

246
00:17:05,899 --> 00:17:07,651
You never protected me.

247
00:17:07,735 --> 00:17:10,946
Not in any way that would put you
on Shadow Weaver's bad side.

248
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:14,408
Admit it. You love being her favorite.

249
00:17:14,491 --> 00:17:15,743
That's not true.

250
00:17:15,826 --> 00:17:17,745
Oh, yeah? When you left,

251
00:17:17,828 --> 00:17:21,081
who do you think took the fall for you?
Who was protecting me then?

252
00:17:21,415 --> 00:17:24,418
You don't have to let Shadow Weaver
treat you like that anymore.

253
00:17:24,501 --> 00:17:26,754
You can leave, just like I did.

254
00:17:26,837 --> 00:17:29,757
Oh, because I need to follow you
everywhere ou go?

255
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,425
I didn't mean it that way.

256
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:35,888
I don't want to leave.
What don't you understand about that?

257
00:17:35,971 --> 00:17:37,890
I'm not afraid of Shadow Weaver anymore,

258
00:17:37,973 --> 00:17:40,768
and I'm a better Force Captain
than you would've ever been.

259
00:17:41,685 --> 00:17:43,937
You said you didn't care
about things like that.

260
00:17:44,521 --> 00:17:46,523
Well, I was lying obviously!

261
00:17:51,445 --> 00:17:52,946
Catra, just wait!

262
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:56,366
Why do you think I gave the sword
back to you in the Fright Zone?

263
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:58,994
I didn't want you to come back, Adora!

264
00:18:07,377 --> 00:18:09,046
[screeching]

265
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:11,965
For the honor of-- [grunts]

266
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:13,258
Huh?

267
00:18:17,221 --> 00:18:19,723
<i>-You were fighting dirty.</i>
-[Shadow Weaver] <i>Insolent child.</i>

268
00:18:19,807 --> 00:18:22,643
-[Adora] <i>I'm sorry, Catra.</i>
-Let me out of here!

[groaning]

[young Catra crying]

271
00:18:33,195 --> 00:18:34,446
Catra?

272
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:43,747
-[hisses]
-Catra, it's okay. It's just me.

273
00:18:44,498 --> 00:18:47,084
It doesn't matter what they do to us.
You know?

274
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:49,545
You look out for me, I look out for you.

275
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:52,798
Nothing really bad can happen
as long as we have each other.

276
00:18:53,257 --> 00:18:54,633
-You promise?
-You promise?

277
00:18:56,301 --> 00:18:57,636
I promise.

278
00:18:59,888 --> 00:19:01,473
Come on. Let's go back out.

279
00:19:20,534 --> 00:19:22,161
[grunting and shouting]

280
00:19:30,794 --> 00:19:33,922
Stop it. I'm not your enemy. Light Hope...

281
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:35,549
Just let me talk to Light Hope!

282
00:19:40,345 --> 00:19:41,847
[metal crashing nearby]

283
00:19:43,432 --> 00:19:44,892
[Catra grunting]

284
00:19:46,435 --> 00:19:47,269
Catra?

285
00:19:50,314 --> 00:19:51,273
Hey, Adora.

286
00:19:51,356 --> 00:19:53,942
Catra, help me. Please.

287
00:19:54,401 --> 00:19:56,737
This thing wouldn't work for me
if I tried, would it?

288
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:58,363
It only works for you.

289
00:19:58,447 --> 00:20:01,950
Then again, you're special.
That's what Shadow Weaver always said.

290
00:20:02,409 --> 00:20:04,620
Catra, what are you doing?

291
00:20:05,078 --> 00:20:07,706
Ah, you know, it all makes sense now.

292
00:20:07,789 --> 00:20:10,083
You've always been the one
holding me back.

293
00:20:10,167 --> 00:20:13,462
You wanted me to think I needed you.
You wanted me to feel weak.

294
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:17,507
Every hero needs a sidekick, right?

295
00:20:17,966 --> 00:20:19,885
Catra, no, that's not how it was.

296
00:20:19,968 --> 00:20:22,471
[Catra laughs]

297
00:20:23,513 --> 00:20:29,102
The sad thing is, I've spent all this time
hoping you'd come back to the Horde,

298
00:20:29,478 --> 00:20:33,982
when really you leaving was the best thing
that ever happened to me.

299
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:38,028
I am so much stronger
than anyone ever thought.

300
00:20:39,738 --> 00:20:42,532
I wonder what I could've been
if I'd gotten rid of you sooner.

301
00:20:43,992 --> 00:20:45,035
[shrieks]

302
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:51,416
I am sorry. I never meant to make you feel
like you were second best.

303
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,168
Please don't do this.

304
00:20:57,297 --> 00:20:58,298
[sword clanging]

305
00:20:59,633 --> 00:21:03,136
Bye, Adora.
I really am going to miss you.

306
00:21:04,221 --> 00:21:06,390
Catra. Catra, no!

307
00:21:15,565 --> 00:21:16,566
Adora.

308
00:21:18,151 --> 00:21:20,404
You must let go.

309
00:21:20,487 --> 00:21:21,571
[sobbing]

310
00:21:30,622 --> 00:21:34,334
Ah. And then there's the day
Catra and I were on a boat together.

311
00:21:34,418 --> 00:21:37,337
-Did I ever tell you about that?
-I'm pretty sure you did.

312
00:21:37,421 --> 00:21:38,964
[rewinding]

313
00:21:39,047 --> 00:21:42,467
[Scorpia on recording] <i>Oh, one time,</i>
<i>Catra and I were on a boat together.</i>

314
00:21:42,551 --> 00:21:45,262
<i>-That was the best day ever.</i>
-Yup, you did.

315
00:21:45,345 --> 00:21:48,682
I think that's when we really made
our connection, you know?

316
00:21:48,765 --> 00:21:51,852
Did you ever meet someone
and you just instantly click?

317
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:54,396
[Entrapta] Yes,
it was like that with Emily.

318
00:21:55,105 --> 00:21:59,568
What happened to you? You're filthy.
Are you okay? Do you need first aid?

319
00:21:59,651 --> 00:22:01,737
Do you need to be nursed
tenderly back to health?

320
00:22:02,237 --> 00:22:05,782
Scorpia, remember that little talk
we had about personal space?

321
00:22:05,866 --> 00:22:08,118
Oh, right. Ten-foot radius.

322
00:22:08,201 --> 00:22:12,289
-How'd it go? Did you find it?
-Uh, why is the princess loose?

323
00:22:12,372 --> 00:22:13,999
Oh, right.

324
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:15,917
[grunts]

325
00:22:16,793 --> 00:22:18,795
Seriously, though, did you find it?

326
00:22:20,047 --> 00:22:22,299
An intact data crystal?

327
00:22:22,382 --> 00:22:25,469
I have never seen one
so perfectly preserved.

328
00:22:25,552 --> 00:22:28,805
This could be a game-changer.
Who knows what secrets it could contain?

329
00:22:28,889 --> 00:22:29,931
[laughs]

330
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:33,143
Man, I knew Catra could do it.
It's like I was telling you.

331
00:22:33,226 --> 00:22:35,812
She is the best friend ever.

332
00:22:37,272 --> 00:22:39,566
[Catra] Just keep it down.
I'm going to bed.
