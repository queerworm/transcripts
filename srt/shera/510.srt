1
00:00:17,642 --> 00:00:21,187
Mermista, Spinnerella and Scorpia
are wreaking havoc across Etheria.

2
00:00:21,271 --> 00:00:23,815
If we wanna stop Horde Prime,
we have to neutralize them

3
00:00:23,898 --> 00:00:26,151
and figure out how to free them
from their chips.

4
00:00:26,234 --> 00:00:27,444
-[yelps]
-Leave this to me.

5
00:00:27,527 --> 00:00:29,863
{\an8}I've been keeping track
of every Princess' weakness.

6
00:00:29,946 --> 00:00:34,659
{\an8}I've discerned the best tactical strategy
to overpower every one of them.

7
00:00:34,743 --> 00:00:36,202
{\an8}Spinny's weakness is obvious.

8
00:00:36,286 --> 00:00:37,579
{\an8}Uh-huh, uh-huh.

9
00:00:37,662 --> 00:00:38,705
Real obvious.

10
00:00:39,247 --> 00:00:41,124
{\an8}And, um, ahem, what is it exactly?

11
00:00:41,207 --> 00:00:45,086
{\an8}[sighs] Everyone knows
she twisted her ankle when she was a kid.

12
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:48,590
{\an8}If you keep her off balance,
her injury will act up on her.

13
00:00:48,673 --> 00:00:52,343
{\an8}Next time we fight, I'll target it,
subdue her and un-chip her

14
00:00:52,427 --> 00:00:54,971
{\an8}and save her and remind her of it
every time she tells me

15
00:00:55,054 --> 00:00:56,431
-it's my turn to clean.
-Right.

16
00:00:56,514 --> 00:00:57,640
But could we circle back

17
00:00:57,724 --> 00:01:02,228
to your not-at-all-weird-and-very-detailed
theories on our weaknesses?

18
00:01:02,312 --> 00:01:05,565
Yeah, not all of us will be as easy
as a twisted ankle.

19
00:01:06,483 --> 00:01:08,651
Oh, you don't believe me.

20
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:11,738
That's-- That's fine.
I'll just demonstrate.

21
00:01:11,988 --> 00:01:14,699
-Entrapta's weakness: tech.
-[Entrapta crashes]

22
00:01:14,783 --> 00:01:16,284
Mermista's: fire.

23
00:01:17,035 --> 00:01:18,620
Frosta's: also fire.

24
00:01:18,953 --> 00:01:21,247
Adora can't act to save her life.

25
00:01:21,414 --> 00:01:24,250
Also, extreme hair-envy with She-Ra.

26
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:29,214
Glimmer: crippling self-doubt
mixed with overwhelming hubris.

27
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:33,426
Whoa, whoa, whoa, that's, like,
really personal compared to fire.

28
00:01:33,885 --> 00:01:36,221
Oh, oh, do me. Do me next.

29
00:01:36,304 --> 00:01:37,597
Perfuma: fire.

30
00:01:38,139 --> 00:01:40,642
And an inability
to unleash your full power

31
00:01:40,725 --> 00:01:43,728
due to your overwhelming fear
of hurting the people you care about.

32
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:47,065
Some might say
that's actually a positive quality.

33
00:01:47,148 --> 00:01:48,066
It's not.

34
00:01:48,983 --> 00:01:49,984
Bow's weakness...

35
00:01:50,568 --> 00:01:51,653
[gasps]

36
00:01:51,861 --> 00:01:55,073
You've spent a lot of time
thinking about this, huh?

37
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:59,869
Contingency plans are how you win,
and I always win.

38
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:01,246
Okay, we get it.

39
00:02:01,454 --> 00:02:03,414
Princesses are easy to take down.

40
00:02:03,498 --> 00:02:07,210
You and your files don't have anything
on real threats, like me.

41
00:02:07,544 --> 00:02:09,546
[screaming]

42
00:02:10,213 --> 00:02:11,047

53
00:02:42,537 --> 00:02:45,957
We need to stop the chipped Princesses
before they hurt anyone else.

54
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:48,293
We've lost track of Spinnerella
after Erelandia,

55
00:02:48,376 --> 00:02:50,336
but there is good news.

56
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:52,172
We know where Scorpia is.

57
00:02:52,422 --> 00:02:53,256
Bow?

58
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:54,841
[clears throat] Uh, Bow?

59
00:02:54,924 --> 00:02:56,801
Huh? Oh, uh, right.

60
00:02:57,093 --> 00:02:59,387
After wreaking havoc
on a town along the coast,

61
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:01,681
Scorpia returned to the Fright Zone.

62
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:06,185
If Scorpia went back to the Fright Zone,
that has to mean something.

63
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:09,522
There's probably a part of her
that remembers it's her home.

64
00:03:09,606 --> 00:03:11,566
That pile of junk isn't anyone's home.

65
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,193
Scorpia saved me.

66
00:03:14,277 --> 00:03:18,031
She stayed behind so the rest of us
could escape the Enchanted Grotto.

67
00:03:18,114 --> 00:03:21,701
If anyone can resist Horde Prime's
programming, it's Scorpia.

68
00:03:21,784 --> 00:03:24,412
Her heart's too strong.
She'd never hurt her friends.

69
00:03:24,495 --> 00:03:28,875
Yeah, she's not great at standing up
to authority figures, trust me.

70
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:32,170
Your negative vibes
aren't appreciated here, Catra.

71
00:03:32,337 --> 00:03:34,547
Look, all that matters is the chip.

72
00:03:34,756 --> 00:03:37,675
Going for the back of the neck
is how we take out Prime's clones.

73
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:41,054
And the only reason that Adora, you know,
saved me or whatever,

74
00:03:41,346 --> 00:03:44,474
is because the chip got damaged first.
That's how we free them.

75
00:03:44,557 --> 00:03:47,560
You think you know how to save Scorpia
better than I do?

76
00:03:47,977 --> 00:03:51,189
I know all about how you treated her
back in the Horde.

77
00:03:51,689 --> 00:03:55,902
Things are different now. Scorpia knows
the kindness of a true friend.

78
00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:57,737
[grunts]

79
00:03:59,197 --> 00:04:00,281
Hoo. Hmph.

80
00:04:01,366 --> 00:04:02,659
[whimpers]

81
00:04:02,951 --> 00:04:07,163
Hey, we all want to save Scorpia,
so, let's work together to do it.

82
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:10,959
If we make our way through the desert,
we can enter the Fright Zone through here.

83
00:04:11,042 --> 00:04:13,461
Catra, Melog, we'll need you to cloak us.

84
00:04:21,052 --> 00:04:22,804
Bow, are you okay?

85
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:24,722
Yeah, yeah. I'm fine.

86
00:04:25,014 --> 00:04:27,016
[beeping]

87
00:04:27,517 --> 00:04:29,560
It's your dads, isn't it?

88
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:34,816
I know they're probably fine.
The Library is really well hidden,

89
00:04:34,899 --> 00:04:37,860
but I haven't heard from them
since we got back.

90
00:04:38,069 --> 00:04:40,363
We should go check on them.
I'll teleport us there.

91
00:04:40,446 --> 00:04:42,740
But, what about the mission?
Scorpia and the others

92
00:04:42,824 --> 00:04:45,702
are controlled by Prime
and your dad might be with them.

93
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:49,122
Bow, Adora and the others
can handle Scorpia.

94
00:04:49,205 --> 00:04:51,708
This mission is just as important.

95
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:54,419
We have to make sure your dads are safe.

96
00:04:56,838 --> 00:04:58,631
I'm really worried about them.

97
00:05:00,008 --> 00:05:01,050
Then let's go.

98
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:03,428
Wherever they are, we'll find them.

99
00:05:19,068 --> 00:05:20,028
It's weird, isn't it?

100
00:05:20,945 --> 00:05:21,904
Being back.

101
00:05:23,114 --> 00:05:25,825
-So many memories here.
-Most of them bad.

102
00:05:31,456 --> 00:05:34,083
Hey, bet I can still
beat you to the forge.

103
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:36,127
Uh, because you always cheat.

104
00:05:36,878 --> 00:05:38,880
[Adora &amp; Catra laughing]

105
00:05:46,262 --> 00:05:47,138
[Adora] Huh.

106
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:51,434
Well, it's different than I remember it.

107
00:05:52,977 --> 00:05:55,813
Hordak and I may have had
a small disagreement

108
00:05:55,897 --> 00:05:57,607
before we were taken by Horde Prime.

109
00:05:57,690 --> 00:05:58,775
[Adora] Whoa.

110
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,320
[Perfuma] Scorpia?

111
00:06:03,905 --> 00:06:04,989
What is she doing?

112
00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:06,866
-Scorpia?
-Get back here.

113
00:06:06,949 --> 00:06:10,745
No. Does no one understand
what stealth means?

114
00:06:10,995 --> 00:06:11,913
Scorpia?

115
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:24,175
[sighs] Your plans are just the worst.

116
00:06:24,258 --> 00:06:25,134
[all yell]

117
00:06:31,933 --> 00:06:32,975
Scorpia?

118
00:06:37,146 --> 00:06:39,065
What's she doing? Why isn't she attacking?

119
00:06:39,148 --> 00:06:42,693
She recognizes us.
I told you she'd never hurt her friends.

120
00:06:42,777 --> 00:06:44,362
[chuckles] Scorpia?

121
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:50,284
[Adora] Perfuma!

122
00:06:53,454 --> 00:06:55,957
She must not be able to tell that it's us.

123
00:07:02,046 --> 00:07:03,005
Whoa.

124
00:07:05,967 --> 00:07:07,260
[gasps]

125
00:07:08,052 --> 00:07:08,970
[yelps]

126
00:07:10,638 --> 00:07:12,974
Scorpia... uh, it's me.

127
00:07:14,142 --> 00:07:16,561
Look, about everything that happened...

128
00:07:17,311 --> 00:07:18,479
I'm really-- [yells]

129
00:07:18,896 --> 00:07:21,065
[screaming]

130
00:07:21,357 --> 00:07:22,483
[meows]

131
00:07:22,692 --> 00:07:23,609
Catra!

132
00:07:27,071 --> 00:07:28,698
For the honor of Grayskull!

133
00:07:31,909 --> 00:07:34,078
[Netossa]
Pretty sure she can tell it's us.

134
00:07:34,162 --> 00:07:35,872
Yes, but I mean, it's Catra.

135
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:37,373
Can we really blame her?

136
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:40,126
[all scream]

137
00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:46,299
Something doesn't feel right.

138
00:07:46,382 --> 00:07:47,758
-[gasps]
-Whoa!

139
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:51,971
Prime Bots.

140
00:07:55,224 --> 00:07:57,351
They're here, right by my home.

141
00:08:00,605 --> 00:08:01,439
Lance?

142
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:03,191
George?

143
00:08:04,275 --> 00:08:06,402
Hang on. I'll check the other rooms.

144
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:08,488
[gasps]

145
00:08:13,868 --> 00:08:14,994
They aren't here.

146
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:18,748
What if Horde Prime has them?
What if he chipped them?

147
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:21,209
We don't know that.
Maybe they went somewhere safe.

148
00:08:21,292 --> 00:08:25,421
All of Etheria is under Prime's control.
They can't defend themselves.

149
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:28,758
They're dads.
And now they've been taken by Horde Prime.

150
00:08:29,133 --> 00:08:31,761
-Uh, Bow?
-I should've never learned archery.

151
00:08:31,844 --> 00:08:34,764
I should've never left home.
Then none of this would've happened.

152
00:08:34,847 --> 00:08:35,681
Bow!

153
00:08:37,391 --> 00:08:38,351
[gasps]

154
00:08:38,726 --> 00:08:39,810
What does it say?

155
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:44,649
It says, "What did the First One say
when they burned dinner?

156
00:08:46,484 --> 00:08:48,277
'It was ruined.'"

157
00:08:49,111 --> 00:08:52,281
Uh, what does that mean?
I don't speak dads.

158
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:54,200
I know where they are.

159
00:08:54,408 --> 00:08:55,701
[yells]

160
00:08:58,496 --> 00:08:59,539
[groans]

161
00:08:59,622 --> 00:09:01,290
That could've gone better.

162
00:09:01,749 --> 00:09:02,708
[meows]

163
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:06,462
Hey, I'm working on being a better friend.
That has to count for something, right?

164
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:08,548
[meowing]

165
00:09:08,631 --> 00:09:10,258
[pipes rattling]

166
00:09:12,301 --> 00:09:13,511
Scorpia's not alone.

167
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:31,779
Her positive energy is being blocked
by all of Prime's negative energy.

168
00:09:31,862 --> 00:09:34,198
We need to-- She-Ra, drop it.

169
00:09:34,282 --> 00:09:35,950
Drop it.

170
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:38,828
We don't throw tanks at our friends.

171
00:09:39,161 --> 00:09:40,997
Yeah, well, this isn't working.

172
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,583
Look at her.
It's like she doesn't even recognize us.

173
00:09:46,794 --> 00:09:49,005
Perfuma, enough with the feelings.

174
00:09:49,297 --> 00:09:52,925
You could be one of
the strongest Princesses if you'd just--

175
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:54,677
I am strong.

176
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,762
But I'm not gonna hurt my friend.

177
00:09:57,722 --> 00:10:00,099
Oh, I really wish she'd stop doing that.

178
00:10:00,308 --> 00:10:03,436
Scorpia, please stop.

179
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:05,438
You don't have to do this anymore.

180
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:24,165
[yelps]

181
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:26,876
[yells]

182
00:10:48,022 --> 00:10:50,066
[Spinnerella]
Still trying to save everyone?

183
00:10:50,816 --> 00:10:52,109
What a wasted effort.

184
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:55,196
This one's mine.

185
00:10:56,739 --> 00:10:57,782
Netossa, wait.

186
00:10:59,033 --> 00:11:01,285
Oh, so, she gets to throw tanks at us.

187
00:11:05,456 --> 00:11:08,834
Oh, "It's ruined."

188
00:11:09,126 --> 00:11:13,673
I get it. [chuckles] That's... terrible.
Why do you think they came here?

189
00:11:13,756 --> 00:11:17,134
They were excavating it,
looking for First Ones artifacts.

190
00:11:17,218 --> 00:11:19,136
It would've been
the last safe place to go.

191
00:11:21,472 --> 00:11:22,348
[both gasp]

192
00:11:25,101 --> 00:11:25,976
Bow?

193
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:28,813
Oh, Bow!

194
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:32,858
Oh, and Glimmer. We didn't hit you,
did we? Sorry. We're so sorry.

195
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:34,944
I'm still teaching him
how to use this thing.

196
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:36,612
And I don't know how use it either.

197
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:40,157
-So, um, it's good you're here.
-You got our message.

198
00:11:40,241 --> 00:11:43,077
[chuckles] I knew you'd "pun-derstand."

199
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:45,413
You will not distract me
with puns right now.

200
00:11:45,496 --> 00:11:46,997
I've been so worried.

201
00:11:47,081 --> 00:11:49,667
You haven't responded
to any of my messages.

202
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:52,586
Our tracker pad's been on the fritz.
And you know we're useless

203
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:55,047
with that kind of thing. We left a note.

204
00:11:55,131 --> 00:11:59,009
You can't just work on ancient history
like nothing's happening.

205
00:12:00,261 --> 00:12:03,180
You were the one who inspired us
to fight for what we believe in.

206
00:12:03,264 --> 00:12:05,683
We're not hiding down here.
We found something.

207
00:12:06,016 --> 00:12:08,227
Something that we think
might help everyone.

208
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:09,186
What did you find?

209
00:12:09,478 --> 00:12:11,605
It's easier if we show you. Come on.

210
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:23,701
[yelps]

211
00:12:24,827 --> 00:12:26,662
Hiding is pointless.

212
00:12:32,209 --> 00:12:35,880
Show yourself
and kneel before Horde Prime's might.

213
00:12:35,963 --> 00:12:37,047
Not a chance.

214
00:12:41,135 --> 00:12:42,052
[both scream]

215
00:12:42,136 --> 00:12:43,220
[coughing]

216
00:12:52,855 --> 00:12:55,608
You're not going anywhere.

217
00:12:57,818 --> 00:12:59,028
Oh, but you are.

218
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:02,156
[yells]

219
00:13:06,827 --> 00:13:08,954
You can't get rid of me that easily.

220
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:14,835
How can Prime do this?

221
00:13:15,252 --> 00:13:18,422
Scorpia was so full of light and kindness.

222
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:21,008
And he stripped that away.

223
00:13:21,258 --> 00:13:24,470
He-- He erased her.
He erased our friendship.

224
00:13:25,095 --> 00:13:26,764
[Perfuma crying]

225
00:13:30,017 --> 00:13:30,935
[both gasp]

226
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:35,147
Oh, no.

227
00:13:39,527 --> 00:13:40,653
[Perfuma screams]

228
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:42,988
[groans]

229
00:13:43,405 --> 00:13:44,573
[screams]

230
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:48,077
Scorpia, please. We're trying to help you.

231
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:55,960
Come on.

232
00:13:59,129 --> 00:14:01,006
Adora, what happened to She-Ra?

233
00:14:01,423 --> 00:14:04,552
I-- I don't know, I just-- I lost her.

234
00:14:13,477 --> 00:14:14,728
Come on, Sword.

235
00:14:22,611 --> 00:14:23,445
[both gasp]

236
00:14:28,576 --> 00:14:30,536
Ah, She-Ra.

237
00:14:32,329 --> 00:14:34,790
Anytime She-Ra wants to come back,
that would be great.

238
00:14:35,124 --> 00:14:37,209
You. What are you doing here?

239
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:59,106
It was long past time
that I saw for myself

240
00:14:59,189 --> 00:15:01,483
what made Etheria so very special.

241
00:15:02,776 --> 00:15:06,071
Starting with
my brother's amusing little stronghold.

242
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:09,658
I told you before,
you're not getting She-Ra.

243
00:15:10,284 --> 00:15:14,914
Oh, my sweet child,
I have no need for you.

244
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:16,916
Not anymore.

245
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:22,046
My little brother's research has given me
everything I need to know.

246
00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:25,758
The technology of this planet
is familiar to me.

247
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:29,094
Ancient, crude, outdated.

248
00:15:29,511 --> 00:15:32,389
It will be child's play
to bypass its defenses

249
00:15:32,681 --> 00:15:35,726
and take the weapon at its heart
for myself,

250
00:15:36,226 --> 00:15:39,021
with... or without you.

251
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:47,363
[George] We unearthed an ancient secret,
long forgotten.

252
00:15:47,696 --> 00:15:49,740
A rebellion from the time
of the First Ones,

253
00:15:49,823 --> 00:15:53,369
fighting against a powerful tyrant,
just like we are.

254
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:55,621
Watch. Eternia.

255
00:15:56,538 --> 00:15:58,040
<i>Greetings, administrator.</i>

256
00:15:58,123 --> 00:15:59,416
<i>What is your query?</i>

257
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:03,295
Uh, that's cool, Dad,
but we met her a while ago.

258
00:16:03,545 --> 00:16:05,464
She, uh, wasn't that helpful.

259
00:16:05,547 --> 00:16:06,799
Oh, that's not it.

260
00:16:07,007 --> 00:16:10,302
We found something hidden
in her programming.

261
00:16:10,386 --> 00:16:12,346
-For the honor of--
-Let me do it this time.

262
00:16:12,429 --> 00:16:14,974
-You always get to do it,
-I don't. You did it last time.

263
00:16:15,057 --> 00:16:18,811
-Okay, fine,
-For the honor of Grayskull!

264
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:22,398
Oh, I love doing that.

265
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:24,733
-Your voice is amazing.
-Oh, thank you.

266
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:27,778
[Bow gasps]

267
00:16:30,531 --> 00:16:31,365
Wow.

268
00:16:31,448 --> 00:16:33,909
We weren't sure what to think
when we first found this.

269
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:35,911
-We thought it must be a glitch.
-But then

270
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:38,122
we remembered that message
on your tracker pad

271
00:16:38,414 --> 00:16:41,875
and how it used coded language
based on the star formations

272
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:43,335
of the distant past.

273
00:16:43,752 --> 00:16:45,504
"Friend of..."

274
00:16:45,587 --> 00:16:48,549
-Uh, not that one. It's just--
-I've got it.

275
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:50,926
"Mara." There.

276
00:16:55,723 --> 00:16:57,599
<i>Greetings, friends of Mara.</i>

277
00:16:58,350 --> 00:16:59,184
Mara.

278
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,145
Mara wasn't alone.

279
00:17:01,603 --> 00:17:06,275
She was working with a group of rebels
going against their First One's leaders.

280
00:17:06,608 --> 00:17:10,320
<i>There is one recording available.</i>
<i>Would you like to review?</i>

281
00:17:10,612 --> 00:17:14,033
-[Lance] Play it.
-[Serenia] <i>This is our last transmission.</i>

282
00:17:14,116 --> 00:17:16,118
<i>If anyone's hearing this,</i>
<i>you need to listen.</i>

283
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:18,871
<i>There is a fail-safe</i>
<i>for the Heart of Etheria.</i>

284
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:22,541
<i>It will allow you to destroy the Heart</i>
<i>and end this for good.</i>

285
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,003
<i>It's at the Arxia outpost,</i>
<i>but we lost touch with them a week ago.</i>

286
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:29,548
<i>If there's anyone's left out there,</i>
<i>you need to find it.</i>

287
00:17:29,631 --> 00:17:32,468
<i>Mara bought us time,</i>
<i>but it's too late for us.</i>

288
00:17:32,926 --> 00:17:37,431
<i>This is Rebel Squadron Grayskull.</i>
<i>And for the last time, we're signing off.</i>

289
00:17:41,769 --> 00:17:43,062
A fail-safe.

290
00:17:43,228 --> 00:17:46,482
There's a fail-safe
to destroy the Heart of Etheria.

291
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:48,692
This could stop Prime
from using the Heart.

292
00:17:48,776 --> 00:17:50,736
This could save the universe.

293
00:17:51,028 --> 00:17:53,155
They said it's at Arxia?

294
00:17:53,322 --> 00:17:54,406
What is that?

295
00:17:54,656 --> 00:17:57,034
That's what we don't know.

296
00:17:57,451 --> 00:18:00,204
The First Ones had different names
for everything on Etheria.

297
00:18:00,287 --> 00:18:04,208
But in all our studies,
we've never heard of a place called Arxia.

298
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:05,626
We have to tell Adora.

299
00:18:05,709 --> 00:18:08,712
If there's a fail-safe out there
somewhere, we need to find it.

300
00:18:08,796 --> 00:18:10,297
[tablet rings]

301
00:18:10,672 --> 00:18:11,924
[gasping]

302
00:18:14,051 --> 00:18:17,096
<i>-Whoa. Are you okay?</i>
-Get us out of here, now.

303
00:18:17,304 --> 00:18:18,263
What's going on?

304
00:18:18,639 --> 00:18:20,099
This whole thing was a trap.

305
00:18:20,849 --> 00:18:23,519
[screams] Why did I get
the Water Princess?

306
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:24,603
[Catra screams]

307
00:18:26,688 --> 00:18:31,485
[grunts] You're lying. You will never
get your hands on the Heart of Etheria.

308
00:18:31,902 --> 00:18:33,445
It is over, Adora.

309
00:18:33,695 --> 00:18:35,989
You will not be able to stop me.

310
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:40,953
As always, your childish fixation
on saving your friends has distracted you.

311
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:44,123
It has made you vulnerable, weak.

312
00:18:44,581 --> 00:18:45,749
You're wrong.

313
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:51,630
There's power, real power,
in love, joy and friendship.

314
00:18:51,922 --> 00:18:55,801
And what could you possibly know
about real power?

315
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:01,390
Friendship isn't a weakness.

316
00:19:01,682 --> 00:19:03,350
It's my greatest strength.

317
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:05,477
And it's Scorpia's, too.

318
00:19:06,937 --> 00:19:09,565
I've heard enough. End this now.

319
00:19:10,607 --> 00:19:13,652
[Perfuma]
Scorpia, you can break through this.

320
00:19:14,027 --> 00:19:15,404
I know you can.

321
00:19:45,392 --> 00:19:48,103
[growls] Submit yourself to inspection.

322
00:19:56,737 --> 00:19:57,571
No matter.

323
00:19:58,155 --> 00:19:59,573
They are insignificant.

324
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:05,078
The plan is under way
and the Heart will soon be in my grasp.

325
00:20:06,496 --> 00:20:07,748
[Netossa yells]

326
00:20:11,084 --> 00:20:12,294
It's almost over.

327
00:20:12,586 --> 00:20:15,839
Let go. Give in to Horde Prime's will.

328
00:20:21,094 --> 00:20:21,929
[screams]

329
00:20:33,273 --> 00:20:34,858
Don't you get it, Spinny?

330
00:20:35,442 --> 00:20:37,152
I'm never letting you go.

331
00:20:37,527 --> 00:20:41,323
Because, Spinny, you're my weakness.

332
00:20:43,158 --> 00:20:44,076
[screams]

333
00:20:57,756 --> 00:20:59,549
[Glimmer, Netossa &amp; Spinnerella appear]

334
00:20:59,633 --> 00:21:00,550
[Perfuma gasps]

335
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:04,096
I got her.

336
00:21:09,518 --> 00:21:10,978
[Melog mews]

337
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:16,984
So, I heard Scorpia dropped a beam on you.

338
00:21:18,318 --> 00:21:19,820
Scorpia missed.

339
00:21:20,362 --> 00:21:21,947
She missed on purpose.

340
00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:24,032
How do you know?

341
00:21:24,408 --> 00:21:27,536
I know because I believe in Scorpia.

342
00:21:29,913 --> 00:21:31,456
I hope you're right.

343
00:21:34,251 --> 00:21:36,962
Scorpia's really lucky
to have a friend like you.

344
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:43,093
It's hard keeping your heart open.

345
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:44,970
It makes you vulnerable.

346
00:21:45,053 --> 00:21:49,891
But it doesn't make you weak,
and I have to believe it's worth it.

347
00:21:57,065 --> 00:22:00,902
[giggles] If you want,
we can work through some guided meditation

348
00:22:00,986 --> 00:22:03,989
to begin to unblock your
abandonment issues and your negativity.

349
00:22:04,197 --> 00:22:06,825
Nah. Uh-uh. No, one thing at a time, okay?

350
00:22:09,244 --> 00:22:10,454
[Adora] A fail-safe.

351
00:22:10,746 --> 00:22:13,373
There's a fail-safe
for the Heart of Etheria.

352
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:15,625
Mara did it.

353
00:22:15,959 --> 00:22:17,044
This could work.

354
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:18,837
We can still save everyone.

355
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:23,633
We can stop the Heart of Etheria for good.
Do we know what it is? Or where it is?

356
00:22:23,717 --> 00:22:27,012
All we know is that it's supposed to be
in some place called Arxia.

357
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:29,723
Other than that... we've got nothing.

358
00:22:29,806 --> 00:22:31,975
[Shadow Weaver] We know where it is.

359
00:22:38,065 --> 00:22:40,150
We have to go to Mystacor.
