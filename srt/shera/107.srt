{\an8}[grunting]

00:00:28,903 --> 00:00:30,363
[Shadow Weaver] Adora.

00:00:30,447 --> 00:00:31,448
[gasps]

00:00:39,456 --> 00:00:40,749
{\an8}[yawning]

5
00:00:42,459 --> 00:00:44,461
Good morning, Glimmer.

6
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:45,795
[groaning]

7
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:49,883
{\an8}It's too early. Five more minutes.

8
00:00:49,966 --> 00:00:54,304
{\an8}-But it's a beautiful morning.
-Today's canceled.

9
00:00:54,387 --> 00:00:55,847
{\an8}Go back to bed.

10
00:00:57,807 --> 00:01:01,394
{\an8}[groans] I can feel you staring at me.

11
00:01:02,437 --> 00:01:06,733
Why is it the one who snores
is the first one to fall asleep?

12
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:09,069
What? I don't snore.

13
00:01:09,152 --> 00:01:10,695
Adora, do I snore--?

14
00:01:11,863 --> 00:01:12,822
Adora?

15
00:01:13,448 --> 00:01:14,616
[groans]

16
00:01:15,158 --> 00:01:16,117
[gasps]

17
00:01:16,201 --> 00:01:18,787
Sorry. Too early to teleport.

18
00:01:23,541 --> 00:01:26,086
-What are we looking at?
-I don't know.

19
00:01:26,169 --> 00:01:28,004
I heard a noise in the woods last night.

20
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:29,547
I thought I saw something.

21
00:01:29,631 --> 00:01:32,675
What? Like a bunny? Maybe a butterfly?

22
00:01:34,969 --> 00:01:39,265
-Adora, did you get any sleep at all?
-[gasps] Someone has to stand guard.

23
00:01:39,349 --> 00:01:41,893
Okay. I know you're on edge
because of what happened

24
00:01:41,976 --> 00:01:45,522
with Entrapta's infected robots,
but it's all over now!

25
00:01:45,605 --> 00:01:51,528
You've got to relax. You need a vacation.
Which is why we're going to Mystacor.

26
00:01:51,611 --> 00:01:53,905
[gasps] Mystacor? No way.

27
00:01:54,364 --> 00:01:55,573
Wait, what's Mystacor?

28
00:01:55,657 --> 00:01:59,661
It's a secret, floating kingdom
that's home to all of Etheria's sorcerers.

29
00:01:59,744 --> 00:02:03,456
It's got tranquil gardens,
beautiful beaches, and healing springs.

30
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:07,168
My Aunt Castaspella just happens
to be head sorceress there.

31
00:02:07,252 --> 00:02:08,419
You'll love it, Adora.

32
00:02:08,503 --> 00:02:11,047
Plus, you won't have to worry
about evil things in the woods.

33
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:13,883
Mystacor is protected
by an invisibility spell,

34
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:15,885
so evil can't find it!

35
00:02:16,261 --> 00:02:19,639
It's the safest and most peaceful place
in all of Etheria.

36
00:02:19,722 --> 00:02:21,683
We'll have you relaxing in no time.

37
00:02:21,766 --> 00:02:23,810
You know, I've never relaxed in my life.

38
00:02:23,893 --> 00:02:27,272
-It might--
-We're about to change that. Just wait.

39
00:02:28,857 --> 00:02:30,483

Shadow Weaver. You wanted to see me?

50
00:03:17,155 --> 00:03:22,035
Ah. Force Captain.
How kind of you to join me.

51
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:27,373
What's up with you?
You're being spookier than usual.

52
00:03:27,457 --> 00:03:29,626
My shadow spies have found Adora.

53
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:34,297
She's on her way to Mystacor
with her new friends. Mystacor.

54
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:36,758
This is going to be too easy.

55
00:03:36,841 --> 00:03:38,218
[groans]

56
00:03:38,301 --> 00:03:42,180
Another Adora mission.
Fine. When do I leave?

57
00:03:42,263 --> 00:03:45,099
[Shadow Weaver] The only place
you're headed is outside my door

58
00:03:45,183 --> 00:03:46,351
to stand guard.

59
00:03:46,434 --> 00:03:51,064
I'm going to use my magic
to go after Adora myself.

60
00:03:51,147 --> 00:03:53,900
You will see that I am not disturbed.

61
00:03:53,983 --> 00:03:57,946
Clearly, no one else can be trusted
to bring her back to the Horde,

62
00:03:58,029 --> 00:04:01,032
least of all you. Now go.

63
00:04:02,116 --> 00:04:03,952
I said, go!

64
00:04:04,035 --> 00:04:05,954
[grunts, then panting]

65
00:04:07,163 --> 00:04:08,081
[gasps]

66
00:04:13,044 --> 00:04:15,713
From the farthest regions of Etheria,

67
00:04:15,797 --> 00:04:20,468
I command you, be as one!

68
00:04:26,975 --> 00:04:28,393
[screeching]

69
00:04:36,567 --> 00:04:37,735
We're here.

70
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:41,030
Uh, we're on a cliff

71
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:45,618
-overlooking a thousand-foot drop.
-Yes, we are. But not for long.

72
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:48,788
-[Glimmer laughs] Woo-hoo!
-Woo-hoo!

73
00:04:48,871 --> 00:04:50,290
Uh, guys?

74
00:04:54,085 --> 00:04:56,087
Come on, Adora. Jump.

75
00:04:56,629 --> 00:04:57,922
[grunting]

76
00:04:59,924 --> 00:05:01,926
[shouting]

77
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:04,429
[gasps, then shouting]

78
00:05:04,512 --> 00:05:06,931
-[grunts]
-Ooh, ouch.

79
00:05:07,015 --> 00:05:08,308
Are you okay?

80
00:05:08,933 --> 00:05:13,479
I'm fine. I thought I saw--
[sighs] I'm just stressed.

81
00:05:13,563 --> 00:05:17,150
Hang in there, Adora. Next stop, Mystacor.

82
00:05:29,787 --> 00:05:31,706
[Glimmer laughing]

83
00:05:31,789 --> 00:05:36,502
We rode a flying mountain through clouds.
It never gets old.

84
00:05:39,255 --> 00:05:42,008
Uh, sure, yeah, heh. It was great.

85
00:05:42,091 --> 00:05:45,553
Just so you know,
my Aunt Casta can be a lot.

86
00:05:45,636 --> 00:05:47,388
But don't worry, I know how to handle her.

87
00:05:47,472 --> 00:05:49,265
Is that my Glimmer?

88
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:50,516
Hi, Aunt Casta.

89
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:54,020
It's been so long
since you've come to visit.

90
00:05:54,103 --> 00:05:55,813
And Bow.

91
00:05:55,897 --> 00:05:56,731
[Bow grunts]

92
00:05:57,106 --> 00:05:59,776
-And who's this?
-This is my friend Adora.

93
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:03,071
She's also sometimes
an eight-foot-tall warrior named She-Ra.

94
00:06:03,154 --> 00:06:05,782
-So don't freak out when it happens.
-Hi.

95
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:10,870
Adora. How nice Glimmer has finally
started making some new friends.

96
00:06:10,953 --> 00:06:14,123
We were all so pleased
when she started bringing Bow around.

97
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:17,251
I was sure she had made him up
at first. [laughing]

98
00:06:17,335 --> 00:06:18,836
-[clearing throat]
-Oh.

99
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:23,216
-You've done something to your hair?
-What? Yes. I cut it.

100
00:06:23,299 --> 00:06:24,425
I can see that.

101
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:28,096
I also see you're not wearing
the sweater I knitted for you.

102
00:06:28,179 --> 00:06:29,055
Don't you like it?

103
00:06:29,138 --> 00:06:31,682
Sure, I like it. It's great.

104
00:06:31,766 --> 00:06:34,644
It's just--
It's a little warm for sweaters right now.

105
00:06:34,727 --> 00:06:37,563
-But you'd tell me if you didn't like it?
-Yes, I'd tell you.

106
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:39,816
I'm wearing the socks you sent me.

107
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:42,151
Well, I've always been fond of this one.

108
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:45,780
So, what brings you all the way
out here to visit your aunt?

109
00:06:45,863 --> 00:06:48,741
Is it once in a blue moon already?
[laughs]

110
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:53,746
We're on a diplomatic mission, Auntie.
I'm rebuilding the Princess Alliance--

111
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:57,375
My goodness, then you must be starving.
I'll have a feast prepared.

112
00:06:57,458 --> 00:06:59,627
I'm sure your mother
hasn't been feeding you.

113
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:03,381
[people laughing]

114
00:07:04,215 --> 00:07:06,676
[gasps] Wow.

115
00:07:09,053 --> 00:07:12,557
You've come at the perfect time.
There's an eclipse this evening.

116
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:15,810
I'm headed right now
to inspect the Lunarium for the ceremony.

117
00:07:15,893 --> 00:07:17,520
And nothing would make me happier

118
00:07:17,603 --> 00:07:20,148
than to give my favorite niece
and her friends a tour.

119
00:07:20,231 --> 00:07:24,569
Uh... Bow and I have had the tour before.
And we don't wanna get in your way.

120
00:07:24,652 --> 00:07:28,364
It's all right, Glimmer.
Adora hasn't seen it. It'll be fun.

121
00:07:29,657 --> 00:07:33,995
Oh. Well, I guess it's up to Adora, then.
What do you say, my dear?

122
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:38,207
-Uh... Sure?
-Oh, I like her.

123
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:40,251
[grumbles]

124
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:44,505
[gasps] Wow.

125
00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:45,923
The lunar lenses.

126
00:07:46,007 --> 00:07:50,595
We use them in the monthly ceremonies
to renew Mystacor's magic defenses

127
00:07:50,678 --> 00:07:53,014
and keep us shielded
from the outside world.

128
00:07:53,097 --> 00:07:55,892
You will be coming to the Eclipse
Ceremony tonight, won't you?

129
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:58,978
Aunt Casta, I've seen
the ceremony dozens of times.

130
00:07:59,061 --> 00:08:01,898
And we're all really tired
from travelling.

131
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:04,484
-Maybe we'll skip it this time?
-Nonsense.

132
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:06,319
Your friend Adora hasn't seen it,

133
00:08:06,402 --> 00:08:08,863
and it's quite a sight to behold
for a newcomer.

134
00:08:08,946 --> 00:08:12,116
Besides, don't you want to spend
more time with your aunt?

135
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:16,454
Of course. But we also really wanted
to show Adora the beach.

136
00:08:16,537 --> 00:08:19,290
Well, if the beach
is the only reason you're here,

137
00:08:19,373 --> 00:08:21,209
I really shouldn't keep you, should I?

138
00:08:21,292 --> 00:08:23,794
I certainly don't want to waste your time.

139
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:25,880
[gasps]

140
00:08:27,298 --> 00:08:29,800
-Auntie, I didn't mean it that way.
-Adora?

141
00:08:31,552 --> 00:08:34,180
Well, someone is enthusiastic.

142
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:42,855
Ah, yes. The Hall of Sorcerers.

143
00:08:43,731 --> 00:08:47,693
These are the Great Ones
who led Mystacor through the ages.

144
00:08:48,319 --> 00:08:50,863
This is Micah, my brother.

145
00:08:50,947 --> 00:08:55,451
We trained in these very halls together.
Glimmer looks just like him, you know?

146
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:57,036
He had a beard.

147
00:08:57,119 --> 00:08:59,330
Wait, Glimmer's dad was your brother?

148
00:08:59,413 --> 00:09:01,666
Adora, do you know what aunt means?

149
00:09:01,749 --> 00:09:04,877
No. I was just hoping someone
would eventually explain.

150
00:09:06,295 --> 00:09:08,422
Auntie, we're going to avenge my dad

151
00:09:08,506 --> 00:09:10,967
and make sure that the Horde
never hurts anyone else.

152
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:13,261
Mom believes in us, and in She-Ra.

153
00:09:13,636 --> 00:09:16,806
Well, if your mother believes,
who am I not to?

154
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:20,518
She's an angelic being after all,
I'm just a common sorceress.

155
00:09:20,601 --> 00:09:23,271
Ugh. Please, not this again.

156
00:09:23,354 --> 00:09:27,441
She never writes to me, you know?
I send letters, but do I ever get a reply?

157
00:09:29,777 --> 00:09:32,154
-What happened to her?
-Light Spinner.

158
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:34,490
A scar on Mystacor's past.

159
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:39,412
She sought power and complete control
above all else, and she was cast out.

160
00:09:39,495 --> 00:09:42,373
Although some say she never really left.

161
00:09:42,456 --> 00:09:47,253
That she's only biding her time,
waiting to exact her revenge.

162
00:09:47,962 --> 00:09:52,300
But those are only children's tales,
of course.

163
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:54,760
Anyway, on with the tour. Are you hungry?

164
00:09:55,303 --> 00:09:59,098
I've had the dining room redone
since last time you were here, Glimmer.

165
00:10:02,184 --> 00:10:03,519
[gasps, then panting]

166
00:10:05,187 --> 00:10:06,439
-[shrieks]
-[Glimmer] Okay.

167
00:10:06,522 --> 00:10:11,193
Aunt Casta's gone to fix us a big dinner
and now it's finally beach time!

168
00:10:13,738 --> 00:10:14,739
You okay?

169
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:18,284
It's worse than we thought.

170
00:10:18,367 --> 00:10:20,953
You need warm sand
and calming waves. Stat.

171
00:10:28,878 --> 00:10:31,130
It's time for something more.

172
00:10:41,182 --> 00:10:43,184
So, we just, like, lie here?

173
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:46,687
Absolutely. Letting your cares melt away.

174
00:10:47,396 --> 00:10:49,607
Didn't you do something like this
to relax in the Horde?

175
00:10:49,982 --> 00:10:51,776
Uh, no. We hit things.

176
00:10:51,859 --> 00:10:54,779
Well, this is so much better. Right, Bow?

177
00:10:54,862 --> 00:10:56,030
[snoring]

178
00:10:56,113 --> 00:10:57,365
Just try it, okay?

179
00:10:57,782 --> 00:10:59,450
[sighs] Okay.

180
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:01,327
[grunts]

181
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,958
[mimicking bird noises]

182
00:11:13,547 --> 00:11:16,217
[grunts, then sighs] Okay.

183
00:11:17,593 --> 00:11:19,637
[humming and groaning]

184
00:11:23,724 --> 00:11:27,228
-This isn't working for you, is it?
-No. Can I move now?

185
00:11:27,311 --> 00:11:28,145
Yes.

186
00:11:28,229 --> 00:11:29,271
[sighs]

187
00:11:29,897 --> 00:11:33,818
Clearly, we're going to have to take
this relaxation thing to the next level.

188
00:11:33,901 --> 00:11:35,569
-Bow, wake up.
-What?

189
00:11:35,653 --> 00:11:38,864
Come on, we need to show Adora
the steam grotto.

190
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:41,909
Whoo! Steam grotto.

191
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:47,707
-Wow.
-Right?

192
00:11:50,668 --> 00:11:52,420
Ah. Ooh. Ah.

193
00:11:53,754 --> 00:11:55,172
Ah.

194
00:11:55,256 --> 00:11:58,676
The pools are full
of magic minerals.

195
00:11:58,759 --> 00:12:01,721
Sorcerers use them to cleanse themselves
of worry and fear

196
00:12:01,804 --> 00:12:03,514
before big ceremonies or spells.

197
00:12:03,597 --> 00:12:05,891
Now, just clear your mind.

198
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:07,685
Breathe deeply.

199
00:12:07,768 --> 00:12:10,646
Focus on the warmth on your skin.

200
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:13,899
Let your body go perfectly...

201
00:12:14,942 --> 00:12:15,901
[snoring]

202
00:12:16,527 --> 00:12:17,403
Ah.

203
00:12:21,031 --> 00:12:22,616
[Shadow Weaver] Adora.

204
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:24,243
[both shouting]

205
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:32,460
No, no, no! No.

206
00:12:32,543 --> 00:12:34,336
-Help!
-Adora!

207
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:38,174
-Shadow Weaver's here! I saw her!
-Adora, there's no one else here.

208
00:12:39,091 --> 00:12:42,344
You brought your sword in here?
Are you okay?

209
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:44,346
-What happened?
-Shadow Weaver was here.

210
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:46,766
In the grotto.
She was in the Sorceress Hall, too.

211
00:12:46,849 --> 00:12:49,685
-I saw her shadow on the floor.
-What are you talking about?

212
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:51,145
Who is Shadow Weaver?

213
00:12:51,228 --> 00:12:54,023
Shadow Weaver raised me in the Horde.

214
00:12:54,106 --> 00:12:56,484
She taught me how to read, tie my boots,

215
00:12:56,567 --> 00:12:59,069
and how to subvert the enemy
and be victorious in battle.

216
00:12:59,153 --> 00:13:03,491
-Okay, sure. Mom stuff.
-No. Commanding officer stuff.

217
00:13:04,366 --> 00:13:07,745
-And mom stuff.
-Adora, she isn't here.

218
00:13:07,828 --> 00:13:10,498
She was never here. It's not possible.

219
00:13:10,581 --> 00:13:12,792
But you don't know what she's capable of.

220
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:16,587
Sounds like this Shadow Weaver
really did a number on you growing up.

221
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:18,923
But you're okay. You got away from her.

222
00:13:19,006 --> 00:13:21,717
Do you wanna try something else?

223
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:25,596
We could get massages
or find you something to hit

224
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:29,225
-if that would work better.
-No. It's okay. I'm okay.

225
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:31,852
I think I need to be alone. Clear my head.

226
00:13:31,936 --> 00:13:33,479
-You sure?
-Yeah.

227
00:13:40,569 --> 00:13:42,905
[Glimmer] Adora has finally lost it.

228
00:13:43,447 --> 00:13:46,826
Did you see her in here?
I think she's going nuts.

229
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:49,620
I'm not crazy!

230
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:55,417
I'm-- I'm not crazy.

231
00:13:58,337 --> 00:13:59,171
[sighs]

232
00:13:59,755 --> 00:14:01,632
You're just a stupid statue.

233
00:14:01,966 --> 00:14:05,845
Pull it together, Adora.
There's no way Shadow Weaver can be here.

234
00:14:07,805 --> 00:14:09,139
[gasps]

235
00:14:10,391 --> 00:14:11,433
[shouts]

236
00:14:13,435 --> 00:14:15,104
For the honor of Grayskull!

237
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:21,360
-[Catra] Hey, Adora.
-[gasps]

238
00:14:22,152 --> 00:14:25,447
Catra? Where are you?
How did you find me here?

239
00:14:25,948 --> 00:14:28,409
[Catra laughing, footsteps nearby]

240
00:14:28,492 --> 00:14:29,326
[Catra] Nope.

241
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:31,328
Getting colder.

242
00:14:31,412 --> 00:14:33,914
Whatever you're doing,
I won't let you get away with it.

243
00:14:33,998 --> 00:14:36,584
-Did Shadow Weaver send you?
-[Catra] What do you think?

244
00:14:36,667 --> 00:14:39,920
Shadow Weaver controls us both.
She always has.

245
00:14:40,004 --> 00:14:41,338
Catra, wait.

246
00:14:41,422 --> 00:14:42,506
[Catra laughing]

247
00:14:45,509 --> 00:14:46,594
Catra?

248
00:14:47,511 --> 00:14:49,638
-[Hordak laughing]
-[gasps]

249
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:53,100
[Hordak] The Horde had
high hopes for you, Force Captain.

250
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:54,894
Disappointing.

251
00:14:54,977 --> 00:14:58,689
Does the Rebellion truly think
you can save them?

252
00:14:58,772 --> 00:15:01,942
Nothing can stop the Horde,
least of all you.

253
00:15:02,026 --> 00:15:04,403
-Show yourself!
-[Hordak] You will lead them all,

254
00:15:04,486 --> 00:15:05,779
every Etherian,

255
00:15:05,863 --> 00:15:08,616
to their complete and utter annihilation.

256
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:11,619
Nothing will be left but smoking ruins.

257
00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:14,872
Your new friends buried beneath.

258
00:15:14,955 --> 00:15:16,206
[yells]

259
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:19,418
[gasps]

260
00:15:21,045 --> 00:15:22,212
[gasps]

261
00:15:24,381 --> 00:15:26,300
What have you done?

262
00:15:26,383 --> 00:15:27,384
[pants] Uh...

263
00:15:27,968 --> 00:15:31,889
-Sorry. I didn't mean-- I thought I saw--
-Adora!

264
00:15:32,723 --> 00:15:34,808
Your friend has destroyed

265
00:15:34,892 --> 00:15:37,061
a thousand years' worth
of sacred writings.

266
00:15:37,144 --> 00:15:40,064
She could've destroyed the lenses
that protect Mystacor.

267
00:15:40,147 --> 00:15:42,816
She didn't mean to. Adora would never--

268
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:46,236
This is the kind of person
you hang around with?

269
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,488
Auntie, wait.

270
00:15:48,572 --> 00:15:50,950
-Glimmer.
-It's okay, I'll handle her.

271
00:15:51,033 --> 00:15:54,286
The Horde isn't here, Adora.
You need to sleep.

272
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:58,457
-Promise me you'll try.
-Okay. I'll try.

273
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:13,639
[knock on door]

274
00:16:15,182 --> 00:16:18,644
-Glimmer. Look, I'm really sorry--
-Save it, Adora.

275
00:16:18,727 --> 00:16:20,062
How could you do this?

276
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:22,731
I thought you were supposed
to be our friend.

277
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:23,899
I am your friend.

278
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:28,570
You've ruined everything I've worked for.
What kind of friend does that?

279
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:32,574
-Glimmer--
-You know what? Maybe you should just go.

280
00:16:49,258 --> 00:16:50,509
Is Adora coming?

281
00:16:50,592 --> 00:16:53,512
I didn't wanna wake her up.
She needs to sleep.

282
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:07,693
[gasps]

283
00:17:10,612 --> 00:17:12,197
[grunting]

284
00:17:21,123 --> 00:17:22,207
[both gasping]

285
00:17:30,591 --> 00:17:31,925
[people screaming]

286
00:17:33,594 --> 00:17:37,473
Adora! Come on,
we have to get out of here now!

287
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:38,557
What's happening?

288
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:41,560
The protection spell is failing!
We need to go!

289
00:17:41,643 --> 00:17:44,605
Wait, stop! What do you mean, failing?
Where's Glimmer?

290
00:17:46,273 --> 00:17:49,818
Everything that's about to happen
is your fault, Adora.

291
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:51,695
You're to blame.

292
00:17:51,987 --> 00:17:53,113
[gasps]

293
00:18:01,997 --> 00:18:03,207
[both groaning]

294
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:07,086
-[Shadow Weaver] Adora.
-Shadow Weaver!

295
00:18:07,169 --> 00:18:08,837
[Shadow Weaver laughing]

296
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:11,965
[grunts]

297
00:18:15,135 --> 00:18:16,553
[shouting]

298
00:18:17,513 --> 00:18:22,101
The eclipse is nearly over, Adora.
When it is, the shield will be down.

299
00:18:22,184 --> 00:18:27,481
The Horde will conquer Mystacor,
and bring you home to me.

300
00:18:27,564 --> 00:18:29,274
No. I'll stop you!

301
00:18:29,358 --> 00:18:32,528
[Shadow Weaver]
Why? To help these people?

302
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:36,156
Who are they to you?
They don't understand you.

303
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,700
Just as they did not understand me

304
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:42,204
when I walked among them as Light Spinner.

305
00:18:42,871 --> 00:18:46,625
-What?
-They feared my dark power.

306
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:49,128
They'll never accept you.

307
00:18:49,211 --> 00:18:52,756
-Not like I do.
-No, no! You're wrong!

308
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,383
For the honor of Grayskull!

309
00:18:57,594 --> 00:18:59,847
You know deep down what I say is true.

310
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:01,723
You are the ambitious,

311
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:05,727
cutthroat, ruthless warrior
I raised you to be.

312
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:06,937
No.

313
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:12,484
The princesses don't care about you.

314
00:19:12,568 --> 00:19:15,779
They want to use you for your strength.

315
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:20,993
Return now to the Fright Zone.
Rule by my side.

316
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:23,996
[grunts]

317
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:27,291
[Adora] These are my friends.
They've been kind to me.

318
00:19:27,374 --> 00:19:32,004
-Something you never were.
-I prepared you for greatness.

319
00:19:32,087 --> 00:19:36,175
But you never loved me.
You just played twisted mind games.

320
00:19:36,258 --> 00:19:39,511
I'm none of the things that you say I am.
I'm not like you.

321
00:19:39,595 --> 00:19:43,098
You are bitter and cruel,
and you're the one who used me!

322
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:44,641
This is who I am.

323
00:19:44,725 --> 00:19:47,603
You hurt my friends,
so now you're gonna pay.

324
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:49,605
[evil laugh]

325
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:52,191
[Shadow Weaver] It's too late.

326
00:19:52,274 --> 00:19:54,985
The eclipse will be over in moments.

327
00:19:55,068 --> 00:19:59,907
Mystacor will fall
and it will be your fault.

328
00:20:03,744 --> 00:20:05,871
[grunting and shouting]

329
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:10,292
[Shadow Weaver yells]

330
00:20:11,001 --> 00:20:12,419
[grunts] Huh?

331
00:20:17,799 --> 00:20:19,218
[Shadow Weaver laughing]

332
00:20:19,301 --> 00:20:20,636
[grunting]

333
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:24,723
I can give you Etheria.
We can rule together.

334
00:20:24,806 --> 00:20:27,351
You were nothing
before I took you in, Adora!

335
00:20:27,434 --> 00:20:30,062
And you will be nothing without me!

336
00:20:30,145 --> 00:20:31,563
You're weak.

337
00:20:37,194 --> 00:20:39,780
Adora, enough of this.

338
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:41,740
Come home.

339
00:20:45,327 --> 00:20:47,037
[groaning]

340
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:53,627
I'm not going back.
You have no power over me anymore.

341
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:54,544
[grunts]

342
00:20:57,965 --> 00:20:59,925
[Shadow Weaver] No!

343
00:21:06,515 --> 00:21:07,683
[all groaning]

344
00:21:19,444 --> 00:21:21,113
Adora! Are you okay?

345
00:21:21,822 --> 00:21:23,198
[Adora] I'm okay. [chuckles]

346
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:26,910
Yeah, I think I'm finally okay!
She's gone.

347
00:21:26,994 --> 00:21:31,915
I'm so sorry we didn't believe you!
We've been bad friends.

348
00:21:31,999 --> 00:21:35,335
No, you're not.
This is what Shadow Weaver does.

349
00:21:35,419 --> 00:21:38,005
She manipulates people,
she pushes them apart.

350
00:21:38,088 --> 00:21:42,718
But it's never gonna work on me again.
I'm sorry, it's my fault she was here.

351
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:44,344
I endangered Mystacor.

352
00:21:44,761 --> 00:21:47,556
Nonsense. You saved Mystacor.

353
00:21:47,639 --> 00:21:51,435
Glimmer has chosen her friends well.
I'll knit you a sweater.

354
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:53,478
What size are you in the shoulders?

355
00:21:55,522 --> 00:21:57,816
I'm, like, really tired.

356
00:22:09,244 --> 00:22:11,955
-Glimmer?
-Right here, Adora.

357
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:22,007
Hello? Shadow Weaver?

358
00:22:27,554 --> 00:22:28,513
[chuckles]

359
00:22:29,931 --> 00:22:33,226
You've been going about this
the wrong way, old woman.

360
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:37,898
If you wanna take down Adora,
you have to go for the heart.

361
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,362
