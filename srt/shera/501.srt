00:00:45,587 --> 00:00:47,213
{\an8}[panting and shouting]

2
00:00:57,891 --> 00:00:59,517
For Etheria!

3
00:01:05,482 --> 00:01:06,566
[both shouting]

4
00:01:08,693 --> 00:01:09,611
Two down!

5
00:01:15,408 --> 00:01:17,827
And a whole Galactic Horde to go.

6
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:22,916
I'll get the next one, I guess.

7
00:01:24,626 --> 00:01:26,628
It's okay, you can come out now.

8
00:01:38,056 --> 00:01:39,182
[all shouting]

9
00:01:39,265 --> 00:01:40,099
Run!

10
00:01:43,561 --> 00:01:44,813
My turn.

11
00:01:48,858 --> 00:01:51,194
-Come on, let's go, before they...
-[shouting]

12
00:01:51,444 --> 00:01:52,529
Adora!

13
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:07,127
For the honor of... Uh...

14
00:02:13,383 --> 00:02:16,386
-Adora!
-I'm okay, I'm okay. Ow.

15
00:02:19,472 --> 00:02:21,015
Adora, chill.

16
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:23,476
You're not She-Ra anymore, remember?

17
00:02:24,686 --> 00:02:25,895
I'm on it!

18
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:28,231
Ugh! I just said...

19
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:33,027
Gotcha.

20
00:02:39,325 --> 00:02:43,413
Well, who are you?

21
00:02:44,122 --> 00:02:46,583
<i>♪ We're on the edge of greatness ♪</i>

22
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,752
<i>♪ Turning darkness to light ♪</i>

23
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:54,507
<i>♪ We're right beside you ready to fight ♪</i>

24
00:02:55,341 --> 00:02:57,844

00:02:57,927 --> 00:03:01,055

28
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:11,316

[gasps]

30
00:03:24,078 --> 00:03:25,038
What is this?

31
00:03:39,135 --> 00:03:39,969
What?

32
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:04,786
[sighs]

33
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:17,090
[gasps]

34
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:33,606
Adora. Did you get any sleep?

35
00:04:35,233 --> 00:04:37,443
Have you finished the updates
to Mara's ship yet?

36
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:39,445
How soon can we take off
to rescue Glimmer?

37
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:42,156
-It's a little more complicated since--
-Space!

38
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:46,160
Sorry, I'm just so excited. In order
to achieve maximum velocity for lift-off,

39
00:04:46,244 --> 00:04:48,955
the repairs and upgrades
to the shields, the engines,

40
00:04:49,038 --> 00:04:51,374
and the life support
should take us approximately...

41
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:54,127
Oh. A very long time.

42
00:04:54,585 --> 00:04:55,712
We don't have time.

43
00:04:55,795 --> 00:04:58,464
Glimmer's up there, somewhere,
waiting for us.

44
00:04:58,881 --> 00:05:02,927
-We just have to figure out where.
-We'll find her. I know we will.

45
00:05:03,011 --> 00:05:04,512
This isn't just a little update.

46
00:05:04,595 --> 00:05:06,723
Space has a lot more dangers
and variables,

47
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:10,393
crushing pressure,
freezing temperatures, vaporization.

48
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,147
All it takes is one little hull breach,
and then, whoosh! That's it.

49
00:05:15,523 --> 00:05:17,817
Besides, there's no telling
where Glimmer could be.

50
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:20,111
Space is always expanding,

51
00:05:20,194 --> 00:05:23,197
always getting bigger and bigger.

52
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,243
[whimpering]

53
00:05:28,453 --> 00:05:33,166
But don't worry, I'm sure we'll determine
her precise location soon.

54
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:36,127
[Frosta] Are you kidding me?

55
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:39,589
[Shadow Weaver] The sorcerer's spells
will only keep us hidden for so long.

56
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:44,469
Then what? This is the only way.
Your daughter understood well enough.

57
00:05:44,552 --> 00:05:46,471
You don't talk to me about my daughter.

58
00:05:46,554 --> 00:05:49,432
[Shadow Weaver] She would have
never had us abandon Bright Moon.

59
00:05:49,515 --> 00:05:50,933
We couldn't hold Bright Moon

60
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:53,978
with the Galactic Horde attacking us
from overhead. We need cover.

61
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:58,107
Which is precisely why
we should use the Heart of Etheria.

62
00:05:58,191 --> 00:05:59,358
Come on!

63
00:05:59,442 --> 00:06:00,818
I can't. I just can't.

64
00:06:00,902 --> 00:06:03,571
Okay, so, we're not doing that,
because, A, without Glimmer

65
00:06:03,654 --> 00:06:07,033
and, more importantly, without She-Ra,
the Heart of Etheria won't work.

66
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:10,787
And, B, when it did "work,"
it nearly destroyed everyone.

67
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,288
So, no, thanks.

68
00:06:12,371 --> 00:06:15,666
Oh, and also, C, we don't like you
and we don't want your help.

69
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:18,211
Also, D, are you still our prisoner?

70
00:06:18,419 --> 00:06:21,547
Could we get a rundown of who is
and who is not our prisoner anymore?

71
00:06:21,631 --> 00:06:23,800
Arguing is not going to help us.

72
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:26,719
We need information on Horde Prime
to find Glimmer.

73
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:29,347
And we won't get any of that
sitting around here.

74
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:30,431
Adora's right.

75
00:06:30,723 --> 00:06:34,977
The best thing we can do now is focus
on evacuations, scouting missions,

76
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:38,898
and keeping everyone safe until we
can learn more of Horde Prime's plans.

77
00:06:39,023 --> 00:06:42,568
Our scouts report that another one of his
spires has been spotted near Thaymor.

78
00:06:42,652 --> 00:06:45,530
Wait, wait, wait,
didn't we just save Thaymor?

79
00:06:45,613 --> 00:06:47,824
-No, you're thinking of Elberon.
-Ugh.

80
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:51,577
Can everywhere stop getting invaded
for, like, five seconds?

81
00:06:51,661 --> 00:06:54,372
-I'll do it. I'll bring them back here.
-Alone?

82
00:06:54,455 --> 00:06:56,874
Adora, you really ought to bring backup.

83
00:06:56,958 --> 00:07:00,503
You're not you-know-who anymore.

84
00:07:01,212 --> 00:07:03,714
Fine. I'll take a team.

85
00:07:05,466 --> 00:07:07,260
I still believe in you, Adora.

86
00:07:07,718 --> 00:07:11,806
You saved me and I know
you're gonna save my little girl.

87
00:07:13,141 --> 00:07:15,309
I promise I'll find Glimmer, Your Majesty.

88
00:07:15,393 --> 00:07:17,770
Wherever she is, we'll get her back.

89
00:07:23,401 --> 00:07:24,360
[sighs]

90
00:07:30,074 --> 00:07:31,200
[grunting]

91
00:07:47,008 --> 00:07:48,092
[groans]

92
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:50,803
Come on. Please work.

93
00:07:54,265 --> 00:07:55,099
Hey!

94
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:57,435
Is anyone there?

95
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:01,606
Someone answer me!

96
00:08:05,443 --> 00:08:06,277
Hello?

97
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:23,461
No bots in sight.
I don't wanna jinx it or anything,

98
00:08:23,544 --> 00:08:26,506
but this is a pretty great
first mission together.

99
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:30,676
I am so happy you said that,
'cause I feel the same way.

100
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:33,471
We're kind of a great team.
Between your hooves...

101
00:08:33,554 --> 00:08:34,847
And your pincers...

102
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:38,184
And our positive attitude,
nothing can get in our way.

103
00:08:39,227 --> 00:08:43,523
Oh, uh, just so you know, I have
been known to sing from time to time.

104
00:08:43,606 --> 00:08:47,026
What? I love singing.
Catra always said it was annoying.

105
00:08:47,401 --> 00:08:49,487
Man, you guys are the best.

106
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:53,616
That's the last of them.
No bots, no drones. We're all clear.

107
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:55,451
[gasps]

108
00:09:03,668 --> 00:09:04,835
Wait!

109
00:09:07,505 --> 00:09:08,339
Here you go.

110
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:13,094
[device beeping]

111
00:09:14,595 --> 00:09:18,474
Uh-oh. Beeps and that look
are never a good combination.

112
00:09:21,352 --> 00:09:22,520
[Bow] We've got trouble.

113
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:26,649
[whispering] Is that Hordak?
Three Hordaks?

114
00:09:26,816 --> 00:09:28,651
That's not Hordak.

115
00:09:29,318 --> 00:09:31,195
[gasps] Clones.

116
00:09:31,946 --> 00:09:35,241
-We need to get out of here.
-I've got a better idea.

117
00:09:35,324 --> 00:09:37,368
-Wait! Adora!
-[Adora shouting]

118
00:09:50,214 --> 00:09:51,882
Excuse me, Lord Prime.

119
00:09:58,389 --> 00:09:59,807
You wanted to see me?

120
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:11,152
Huh.

121
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:13,988
-Catra.
-[hisses]

122
00:10:14,363 --> 00:10:17,116
That is your name, is it not?

123
00:10:18,117 --> 00:10:21,662
I have been reviewing the memories
of my defective brother.

124
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:26,250
It seems he had very little love
towards you at the end.

125
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:29,295
Hmm.

126
00:10:29,378 --> 00:10:33,507
The question is,
what do we do with you now?

127
00:10:34,216 --> 00:10:37,511
Remember that big,
planet-sized Etheria weapon?

128
00:10:37,595 --> 00:10:40,348
Well, I'm the only one
who can tell you how it works.

129
00:10:40,431 --> 00:10:42,058
You need me.

130
00:10:44,602 --> 00:10:47,897
You would pledge your loyalty
to me, Catra?

131
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:52,943
What do you say?

132
00:10:57,657 --> 00:10:58,491
I'm ready.

133
00:11:09,293 --> 00:11:10,127
Wait!

134
00:11:18,761 --> 00:11:19,595
No!

135
00:11:21,722 --> 00:11:23,599
You're awake. [laughs]

136
00:11:23,682 --> 00:11:24,892
Hello, Adora.

137
00:11:25,267 --> 00:11:26,185
[groans]

138
00:11:26,268 --> 00:11:27,228
What happened?

139
00:11:27,812 --> 00:11:30,231
Where are those clones? Did we get them?

140
00:11:30,731 --> 00:11:34,485
Okay, um, don't get mad,
but I may have had to sting you.

141
00:11:34,568 --> 00:11:35,403
Just a little.

142
00:11:35,486 --> 00:11:36,654
What?

143
00:11:36,737 --> 00:11:40,866
You were refusing to retreat,
and we really, really needed to run away.

144
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:42,785
Space clones!

145
00:11:42,868 --> 00:11:44,578
You stung me?

146
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:47,456
[Scorpia] I'm sorry, so sorry.

147
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:49,959
But I don't regret it,
and will do it again if needed.

148
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:51,627
Mm. Sorry, again.

149
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:54,422
Adora, you can't run
into battle like that.

150
00:11:54,713 --> 00:11:55,714
Not anymore.

151
00:11:55,798 --> 00:11:58,926
You have to stop acting
like you're invincible. You aren't--

152
00:11:59,009 --> 00:12:00,177
You don't need to say it.

153
00:12:00,469 --> 00:12:03,556
I know. I made that choice,
I'm living with the consequences.

154
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:05,724
What were you even trying to do?

155
00:12:05,808 --> 00:12:08,936
Maybe I could get those clones
to tell us where Glimmer is being held.

156
00:12:09,019 --> 00:12:11,897
Then at least I'd be one step closer
to saving her.

157
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:15,526
That's... not a bad idea.

158
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:17,403
Wait, what?

159
00:12:17,486 --> 00:12:21,073
Trying to fight a troop of clones
by yourself is reckless.

160
00:12:21,157 --> 00:12:24,827
Catching and questioning one clone
is also reckless,

161
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:27,037
but this time we do it together.

162
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:38,048
[Adora] Hey.

163
00:12:38,632 --> 00:12:39,967
Ready to go again?

164
00:13:00,821 --> 00:13:03,115
You can't hold me here forever!

165
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:13,626
Great. You.

166
00:13:13,709 --> 00:13:14,877
[chuckles]

167
00:13:15,002 --> 00:13:16,962
Pretty fancy accommodations, huh?

168
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:19,173
Well, for a prisoner, that is.

169
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:21,133
How's it going, princess?

170
00:13:21,926 --> 00:13:25,554
Don't pretend like you're any better off
than I am right now.

171
00:13:26,096 --> 00:13:30,267
You may be on the other side of this
force field, but you're as alone as I am.

172
00:13:31,393 --> 00:13:33,604
The Horde's the Horde, even in space.

173
00:13:33,812 --> 00:13:37,024
As long as I'm of value to Horde Prime,
I've got a place in this world.

174
00:13:37,274 --> 00:13:40,361
I can work my way up here,
just like I did before.

175
00:13:40,611 --> 00:13:41,570
[Glimmer chuckles]

176
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:46,075
Is that really what you want?
We both saw what happened to Hordak.

177
00:13:46,158 --> 00:13:48,827
Do you really think
you can come out on top?

178
00:13:49,745 --> 00:13:54,416
[both] Horde Prime requests your presence
as his guests for dinner this evening.

179
00:13:55,584 --> 00:13:56,460
Both of you.

180
00:14:06,845 --> 00:14:11,100
Horde Prime took my friend Glimmer,
and I want her back. Where is she?

181
00:14:11,725 --> 00:14:12,643
Fear not.

182
00:14:12,726 --> 00:14:15,896
Your friend is an honored guest
of Horde Prime,

183
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:19,775
emperor of the Galactic Horde,
ruler of the known universe,

184
00:14:19,858 --> 00:14:21,902
regent of the seven skies--

185
00:14:22,653 --> 00:14:24,738
I said, where?

186
00:14:24,822 --> 00:14:27,241
She is with Prime on his flagship,

187
00:14:27,449 --> 00:14:29,535
safe at the heart of his empire,

188
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:31,745
far from your paltry world.

189
00:14:31,954 --> 00:14:35,416
She is chosen,
basking in the light of Prime's favor,

190
00:14:35,499 --> 00:14:37,877
he who brings the day and the night.

191
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:40,379
-Okay, we get it.
-Glory be to Horde Prime,

192
00:14:40,462 --> 00:14:43,591
-[all groaning]
-revered one of the shining galaxies,

193
00:14:43,757 --> 00:14:45,843
promised one of a thousand suns--

194
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,804
Ugh. Did Hordak talk this much?

195
00:14:48,971 --> 00:14:53,225
No, he mainly growled
and yelled "get out" a lot.

196
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:54,351
[clone laughing]

197
00:14:55,185 --> 00:14:58,647
Your queen is safe.
Unlike your rebel friends.

198
00:14:58,731 --> 00:14:59,940
What do you mean?

199
00:15:00,316 --> 00:15:01,901
[clone] Horde Prime sees all.

200
00:15:01,984 --> 00:15:03,569
Horde Prime knows all.

201
00:15:03,944 --> 00:15:07,948
You can abandon Bright Moon,
cloak your rebel camp in illusions,

202
00:15:08,032 --> 00:15:10,492
but we will find you.

203
00:15:12,536 --> 00:15:14,622
That's from Micah. They're in trouble!

204
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:33,140
This is amazing!

205
00:15:33,223 --> 00:15:35,851
Alien tech from a distant world.

206
00:15:41,023 --> 00:15:42,524
[Shadow Weaver] Micah!

207
00:15:46,987 --> 00:15:47,821
Hmm.

208
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,325
You're welcome.

209
00:15:57,581 --> 00:15:59,667
This way. Excuse me, pardon me.

210
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:02,211
-Hi, hello. How are you? Watch out there.
-Come on.

211
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:03,629
Adora, wait.

212
00:16:03,712 --> 00:16:04,672
I can do this.

213
00:16:10,344 --> 00:16:11,178
Thanks.

214
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:24,608
[Horde Prime]
Are you comfortable, Your Majesty?

215
00:16:27,736 --> 00:16:29,822
I strive to treat my guests well.

216
00:16:29,905 --> 00:16:33,242
I believe we can learn a great deal
from one another.

217
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:43,377
Ah. Enjoyable, yes?

218
00:16:43,544 --> 00:16:47,798
It's a delicacy from a distant world,
light years away from here.

219
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:50,592
It was very much like Etheria.

220
00:16:51,135 --> 00:16:57,266
This dish is incredibly rare,
as that world no longer exists.

221
00:17:02,062 --> 00:17:03,105
Seconds?

222
00:17:04,064 --> 00:17:05,482
No. Thank you.

223
00:17:05,733 --> 00:17:09,486
Speaking of Etheria,
you must miss it terribly.

224
00:17:09,778 --> 00:17:12,281
Would you like to see your home world now?

225
00:17:13,073 --> 00:17:14,241
[crowd shouting]

226
00:17:18,328 --> 00:17:19,246
[Glimmer gasps]

227
00:17:21,165 --> 00:17:22,374
[Glimmer grunting]

228
00:17:28,922 --> 00:17:29,840
No.

229
00:17:35,429 --> 00:17:36,847
Why are you doing this?

230
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:41,018
Every rebellion forms around a leader,
a beacon of hope,

231
00:17:41,602 --> 00:17:43,562
that little note of discord.

232
00:17:44,938 --> 00:17:50,110
Ah. Here she is, your beacon of hope.

233
00:17:50,194 --> 00:17:51,403
Adora.

234
00:17:52,488 --> 00:17:53,322
She-Ra.

235
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:58,619
A nuisance that must be purged
in order to bring peace to Etheria.

236
00:18:15,719 --> 00:18:16,553
No!

237
00:18:16,804 --> 00:18:18,722
Stop! Don't hurt her!

238
00:18:21,225 --> 00:18:23,560
You wanna use the weapon, right?

239
00:18:23,644 --> 00:18:27,856
You need all the princesses,
and that includes She-Ra.

240
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:31,443
Without her,
the Heart of Etheria is useless.

241
00:18:32,027 --> 00:18:33,445
You can't hurt her.

242
00:18:35,864 --> 00:18:36,865
Very well.

243
00:18:38,242 --> 00:18:41,453
This has been most illuminating.
Thank you, Glimmer.

244
00:18:41,745 --> 00:18:45,165
I do look forward
to more of our conversations.

245
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:47,584
But for now, eat up.

246
00:19:00,055 --> 00:19:01,098
[grunts]

247
00:19:04,017 --> 00:19:05,269
[Scorpia shouting]

248
00:19:09,106 --> 00:19:10,482
Adora, are you okay?

249
00:19:10,566 --> 00:19:12,818
No. You were right, Bow.

250
00:19:12,901 --> 00:19:14,403
I can't fight them all.

251
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:16,864
I'm not strong enough, I'm not She-Ra.

252
00:19:16,947 --> 00:19:21,577
I'm not a hero anymore, I'm just me.
And I can't do this alone.

253
00:19:22,369 --> 00:19:24,246
But, Adora, you aren't alone.

254
00:19:25,205 --> 00:19:26,290
You've never been.

255
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:34,006
We've got this. Together.

256
00:19:36,925 --> 00:19:37,759
Together.

257
00:19:41,054 --> 00:19:42,097
Scorpia! Coming at you!

258
00:19:46,518 --> 00:19:48,020
Bow! The drone!

259
00:19:48,103 --> 00:19:49,188
Got it!

260
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:55,319
Frosta, ice catapult.

261
00:20:04,578 --> 00:20:07,080
We can't stay here. It isn't safe anymore.

262
00:20:07,164 --> 00:20:09,249
We're kind of running out
of places to hide.

263
00:20:10,584 --> 00:20:11,418
[gasps]

264
00:20:14,087 --> 00:20:16,965
I think I know where we can go.

265
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:20,469
And we better hurry. Come on.

266
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:30,020
Neat trick with all the footage
of her friends in danger.

267
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:33,023
These princesses are so predictable
with their feelings.

268
00:20:33,857 --> 00:20:35,108
As were you.

269
00:20:37,694 --> 00:20:41,281
-What?
-Elevated heart rate, dilated pupils.

270
00:20:41,698 --> 00:20:44,409
Adora means something to you.

271
00:20:44,993 --> 00:20:47,913
No. She doesn't.
She chose her side, I chose mine.

272
00:20:48,163 --> 00:20:49,581
She means nothing to me.

273
00:20:50,207 --> 00:20:52,334
You Etherians are all alike.

274
00:20:52,417 --> 00:20:55,295
Such strong connections to one another.

275
00:20:55,379 --> 00:20:57,756
It's what makes you weak.

276
00:20:59,216 --> 00:21:01,218
What are you going to do with me?

277
00:21:01,343 --> 00:21:03,971
Now that I know
about She-Ra and the weapon,

278
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:06,598
what purpose do I have for you?

279
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:10,602
Your little ploy of parsing out
information like a bargaining chip

280
00:21:10,686 --> 00:21:12,938
was never going to last long out here.

281
00:21:13,438 --> 00:21:14,940
I see all.

282
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:17,401
I know all.

283
00:21:19,236 --> 00:21:23,073
But fear not, I have great plans for you.

284
00:21:23,448 --> 00:21:26,159
Every part of the machine is of value.

285
00:21:27,035 --> 00:21:29,663
Even you, little sister.

286
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:35,168
Adora, where are we going?

287
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:39,339
It's around here somewhere.
A place where we'll be safe.

288
00:21:39,423 --> 00:21:42,467
Madame Razz brought me there,
and I saw it again in my dreams.

289
00:21:42,551 --> 00:21:44,428
I just have to hope it lets us in.

290
00:21:50,851 --> 00:21:51,685
There.

291
00:22:02,904 --> 00:22:03,739
Whoa.

292
00:22:04,531 --> 00:22:05,866
-[gasps]
-Whoa.

293
00:22:09,077 --> 00:22:09,995
Wow.

294
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:15,917
Where are we?

295
00:22:17,377 --> 00:22:19,296
The deepest part of the Whispering Woods.

296
00:22:19,755 --> 00:22:22,257
Horde Prime won't find us here.
We're safe.

297
00:22:22,883 --> 00:22:24,885
Now, we just need to set up camp and--

298
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:26,678
-[grunting]
-Adora!

299
00:22:35,896 --> 00:22:37,064
[shouts]

300
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:39,024
[Bow] Adora!

301
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:44,362
[closing theme playing]
