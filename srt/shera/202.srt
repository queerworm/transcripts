57 percent more effective

24

my own abilities first?

As She-Ra, your sacred connection
with your steed

28
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:19,013
is as important
as any of your physical abilities.

-Hi, Adora! I've been here a while,
-[shouts]

32
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:30,567
but there wasn't a good moment
to make my grand entrance, until now.

33
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:36,614
I requested his presence. The time has
come for the two of you to forge your--

34
00:02:39,075 --> 00:02:41,244
What do you mean? Entrapta's alive?

35
00:02:41,327 --> 00:02:45,957
I couldn't figure out how the Horde was
making such big technological advances.

36
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:50,461
But it all makes sense now.
They must be holding Entrapta prisoner.

37
00:02:50,545 --> 00:02:52,589
I found First Ones tech in this bot.

38
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:56,092
This is what Entrapta
was experimenting with before she--

39
00:02:56,175 --> 00:02:58,761
Before we left her in the Fright Zone.

40
00:03:02,181 --> 00:03:04,142
-We didn't know.
-It doesn't matter.

41
00:03:04,225 --> 00:03:07,312
We should've gone back for her.
We should've tried.

42
00:03:07,395 --> 00:03:10,148
She got captured trying to save us.

43
00:03:10,815 --> 00:03:14,235
Well, we're not leaving her there now.
We've got to rescue her.

44
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:16,988
How? We can't just walk
into the Fright Zone.

45
00:03:17,071 --> 00:03:19,782
That's how we got into this mess
in the first place.

46
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:22,410
Maybe we don't have to. Look.

47
00:03:22,493 --> 00:03:26,372
-No. The Horde took Dryl!
-We just got word.

48
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:29,167
The Horde has Entrapta,
and now they have Dryl.

49
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:32,420
-The timing can't be a coincidence.
-Of course.

50
00:03:32,503 --> 00:03:34,714
They're making her use her own lab.

51
00:03:34,797 --> 00:03:38,843
We're going to the Crypto Castle,
we'll find Entrapta and bring her back.

52
00:03:38,927 --> 00:03:43,932
-No princess left behind.
-Yes! Totally onboard. Let's get Adora.

53
00:03:44,015 --> 00:03:48,394
-Adora is out training with Light Hope.
-What about the other princesses?

54
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:51,773
Entrapta got taken trying to save us, Bow.

for losing anyone else.

00:04:12,794 --> 00:04:15,004
Forgive me. My system is overloading.

64
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:18,341
I may have to delay today's training
so that I can rest.

65
00:04:18,424 --> 00:04:21,135
-Is there anything I can do to help?
-Perhaps.

66
00:04:22,387 --> 00:04:24,055
This is the Watchtower.

67
00:04:24,138 --> 00:04:27,642
Once, it allowed me
to access my planetary mainframe.

68
00:04:27,725 --> 00:04:32,063
But it was destroyed by Mara when
she lost control and attacked Etheria.

69
00:04:32,146 --> 00:04:36,025
I have been functioning at only a fraction
of my power ever since.

70

If you can repair the Watchtower,

71
00:04:38,152 --> 00:04:41,447
my capabilities will improve,
and training can commence.

72
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:44,867
-Fix the Watchtower. Got it.
-Only then--

00:11:05,915 --> 00:11:08,709
-She's my best friend.
-Good to know.

168
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:10,628
-[gasps, then shouting]
-Bow!

169
00:11:12,755 --> 00:11:15,800
-Oh, hey, princess.
-How are you such a nightmare?

170
00:11:15,883 --> 00:11:18,761
-Ah. Years of practice.
-Can you please discuss this

171
00:11:18,844 --> 00:11:21,389
when we're not hurtling to our deaths?

172
00:11:21,472 --> 00:11:24,225
I'm ready to see if cats do land
on their feet.

173
00:11:24,308 --> 00:11:27,395
Please, don't do that!
She is attached to me!

174
00:11:28,062 --> 00:11:30,481
-Glimmer!
-[groans] Okay.

175
00:11:34,151 --> 00:11:35,861
-Not a fan of water, huh?
-[coughing]

176
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:39,240
-Get off of me!
-Glimmer! Help!

177
00:11:39,323 --> 00:11:40,199
[groans]

178
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:44,036
Okay, ready to be rescued from this
whenever you are.

179
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:46,122
Just need a minute to rest.

180
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:48,541
Um, what could you do with ten seconds?

181
00:11:50,793 --> 00:11:53,546
Ha! Seriously,
you guys are terrible at this.

182
00:11:53,629 --> 00:11:54,463
[groans]

183
00:12:00,261 --> 00:12:01,512
[laughing]

184
00:12:01,595 --> 00:12:04,974
At least we're in one piece.
Can't say the same for Entrapta.

185
00:12:05,057 --> 00:12:06,559
[shouts, then grunts]

186
00:12:07,101 --> 00:12:08,811
Glimmer. Are you okay?

187
00:12:08,894 --> 00:12:12,148
Aw, what's wrong?
Sleepy after all that magic?

188
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:13,816
[both grunting]

189
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:15,985
I'm fine. You're not worth my time.

190
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:18,904
Come on, it's a long walk to Bright Moon.

191
00:12:19,864 --> 00:12:20,739
Hmm.

192
00:12:21,282 --> 00:12:23,325
-[shouts]
-[laughing]

193
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:24,785
Put more ropes on her!

194
00:12:27,746 --> 00:12:31,876
What do you mean there's no sign of her?
Where could they have gone?

195
00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:34,003
Think, Scorpia. Do we tell Hordak?

196
00:12:34,086 --> 00:12:38,132
Send out a search party? Put up posters?
How are we gonna find Catra?

197
00:12:38,215 --> 00:12:42,595
If somebody has touched a hair
on her head, I don't know-- Huh?

198
00:12:42,678 --> 00:12:44,096
[tablet beeping]

199
00:12:45,389 --> 00:12:47,600
[gasps] Oh, she's signaling us!

200
00:12:47,683 --> 00:12:50,603
We can follow this right to her.
Catra, I'm coming!

201
00:12:57,693 --> 00:12:59,111
Try concentrating.

202
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:02,907
-Focus the She-Ra. She-Ra...
-I can't concentrate

203
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:06,952
when you're distracting me!
This worked in Salineas.

204
00:13:07,036 --> 00:13:11,290
You know what might help? Loop-de-loops.
With me. Get on my back.

205
00:13:11,373 --> 00:13:15,461
-You're not taking this seriously.
-Everything's better with loop-de-loops.

206
00:13:15,544 --> 00:13:18,130
[groans] It's fine. I got this.

207
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:24,345
[grunting]

208
00:13:32,102 --> 00:13:33,479
Still got this.

209
00:13:37,691 --> 00:13:41,028
[Catra] I don't know about you guys,
but I am beat.

210
00:13:41,111 --> 00:13:44,198
Getting held hostage is so much work.

211
00:13:44,782 --> 00:13:46,116
[yawning]

212
00:13:46,617 --> 00:13:50,454
Almost as exhausting
as torturing Entrapta every day.

213
00:13:50,538 --> 00:13:53,290
Ugh. Just ignore her.

214
00:13:53,374 --> 00:13:54,917
[giggling]

215
00:13:57,002 --> 00:13:59,964
You're looking pretty tired, too,
princess.

216
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:06,428
-Running out of glitter?
-Aah! Bow, can't you keep her mouth shut?

217
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:09,431
-I tried, but she bites.
-Mm.

218
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:13,561
[shouts] How did Adora take years of this?

219
00:14:13,644 --> 00:14:18,065
She didn't run away from the Horde,
she ran away from you.

220
00:14:18,148 --> 00:14:22,069
And where is she now, huh?
Off being She-Ra? Get used to it.

221
00:14:22,152 --> 00:14:25,406
You think she's not going
to leave you behind, too, Sparkles?

222
00:14:27,157 --> 00:14:28,409
[Scorpia] Don't move!

223
00:14:39,253 --> 00:14:40,254
[She-Ra grunting]

224
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:44,800
-How's that look?
-You know what?

225
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:46,886
I don't think that one goes there.

226
00:14:46,969 --> 00:14:51,974
In fact, it might be upside down.
You should take it apart and start again.

227
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:57,062
You seem stressed.
Why don't we list all our favorite things?

228
00:14:57,146 --> 00:15:01,650
I'll go first. Apples, hay,
toppling unjust hierarchies, apples...

229
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:03,319
Wait, I said that already.

230
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:04,528
[shouts]

231
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:08,699
-What are you doing?
-I'm helping!

232
00:15:08,782 --> 00:15:11,952
I'm She-Ra's steed and that's what I do!

233
00:15:13,203 --> 00:15:16,957
-This isn't helping! Can you just...?
-Adora!

234
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:21,337
Catra, are you okay? Did they hurt you?
I will crush them!

235
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:27,259
She's fine! We want to make a trade. We'll
release Catra if you release Entrapta.

236
00:15:27,343 --> 00:15:32,222
I have a better trade. You release me
right now or we finish Entrapta off

237
00:15:32,306 --> 00:15:33,307
once and for all.

238
00:15:33,974 --> 00:15:35,309
-What?
-She's bluffing.

239
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:38,562
Scorpia, get Kyle on the comm.

240
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:45,778
[Entrapta shouting]
<i>No, no, no! Wait! Wait! Oh, no!</i>

241
00:15:45,861 --> 00:15:49,073
[Kyle] <i>Force Captain, I knew you'd</i>
<i>call me back! What do I do?</i>

242
00:15:49,156 --> 00:15:53,702
If you don't hear from us in 30 seconds,
take Entrapta out.

243
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:55,287
What?

244
00:15:56,205 --> 00:16:00,626
Just relax. We're figuring this out.
Everything's okay.

245
00:16:02,086 --> 00:16:03,253
[shouting]

246
00:16:03,337 --> 00:16:07,508
-Two can play at that game.
-Catra! If you touch her again...

247
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:10,511
Easy there, big gal.
She's not gonna try anything.

248
00:16:10,594 --> 00:16:12,513
They're noble Rebels after all.

249
00:16:12,596 --> 00:16:14,431
They play by the rules.

250
00:16:14,515 --> 00:16:15,766
[shouting]

251
00:16:18,602 --> 00:16:19,853
Glimmer, stop!

252
00:16:21,355 --> 00:16:25,192
This isn't fair!
After everything she's done?

253
00:16:25,275 --> 00:16:29,363
After what she did to us?
We're supposed to just let her go?

254
00:16:30,948 --> 00:16:35,285
How do we know they'd really get rid
of Entrapta, Bow? They need her.

255
00:16:35,494 --> 00:16:39,331
We can't take that chance! We're not them.

256
00:16:44,962 --> 00:16:49,883
Oh! Oh, come here! Come on!
I'm just so glad this nightmare is over.

257
00:16:50,634 --> 00:16:52,136
[laughing]

258
00:16:52,219 --> 00:16:54,722
Wow. I didn't think
you'd actually buy that.

259
00:16:55,556 --> 00:17:00,060
We held up our end of the bargain.
Now, show us that Entrapta's alive.

260
00:17:00,144 --> 00:17:03,772
You and Adora are perfect for each other,
I'll give you that.

261
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:07,484
Earnest, naive, ridiculously easy
to manipulate.

262
00:17:07,568 --> 00:17:09,153
It's adorable.

263
00:17:09,611 --> 00:17:12,614
And it's why you're never going to win.

264
00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:16,535
Kyle, if you actually took me seriously
just then, call it off.

265
00:17:16,618 --> 00:17:18,912
[Entrapta]
<i>Kyle isn't available at the moment.</i>

266
00:17:18,996 --> 00:17:20,873
[Kyle shouting]

267
00:17:20,956 --> 00:17:23,292
But I've got it under control.

268
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:31,383
Don't worry. This was just the prototype.
The next model will be much, much bigger.

269
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:36,180
-Entrapta? What's going on?
-Oh, hey. You wanna talk to her?

270
00:17:36,263 --> 00:17:37,931
<i>Hi, Bow, what are you doing there?</i>

271
00:17:38,015 --> 00:17:40,851
Just hang on, Entrapta,
we're going to rescue you.

272
00:17:40,934 --> 00:17:43,812
<i>Oh, good. Rescue me from what?</i>

273
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:46,732
-From the Horde!
<i>-Oh. Well, that's nice of you.</i>

274
00:17:46,815 --> 00:17:50,819
<i>But all of my stuff is here now,</i>
<i>so probably I'll just stay.</i>

275
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:56,283
<i>-Thanks anyway, though.</i>
-Entrapta, are you on the Horde's side?

276
00:17:57,117 --> 00:18:01,830
<i>I'm on the side of science.</i>
<i>But I am living at the Fright Zone now</i>

277
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:06,210
<i>and the Horde is supplying me</i>
<i>with tools and materials for my work.</i>

278
00:18:06,293 --> 00:18:10,881
<i>-So, yes, I guess?</i>
-Did I forget to mention that? Ha. Oops.

279
00:18:10,964 --> 00:18:13,884
<i>But don't worry about me. I love it here.</i>

280
00:18:13,967 --> 00:18:16,762
<i>I've made unbelievable progress</i>
<i>in my research.</i>

281
00:18:16,845 --> 00:18:19,473
<i>And the Horde has been so supportive.</i>

282
00:18:19,556 --> 00:18:23,519
<i>I'm getting closer every day</i>
<i>to unraveling the mysteries of Etheria.</i>

283
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:26,480
<i>Hacking the Black Garnet</i>
<i>was just the first step.</i>

284
00:18:26,563 --> 00:18:30,776
-That was you?
-So much for the power of friendship.

285
00:18:30,859 --> 00:18:31,944
[sighs]

286
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:35,823
Come on, Glimmer. Let's go.

287
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:38,075
Glimmer?

288
00:18:38,283 --> 00:18:39,243
[grunts]

289
00:18:40,035 --> 00:18:40,953
[shouting]

290
00:18:41,829 --> 00:18:45,707
-Adora! Adora! Are you okay?
-I don't know what I'm doing.

291
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:48,377
I don't even know what this Watchtower
is supposed to do

292
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:50,045
or how it's supposed to help.

293
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:53,715
If that's the case,
then why are you doing all of this?

294
00:18:55,217 --> 00:18:58,137
I need to be a better She-Ra than Mara.

295
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:01,974
I need to control my powers
so I don't hurt people like she did.

296
00:19:02,057 --> 00:19:05,310
Light Hope is the only one
who can teach me, and she's broken.

297
00:19:06,103 --> 00:19:08,730
You're really freaking out
about this Mara thing.

298
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:11,817
How could I not? She ruined everything.

299
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:13,986
And I don't know how to fix it.

300
00:19:14,069 --> 00:19:16,864
Sorry I didn't take this mission
more seriously.

301
00:19:16,947 --> 00:19:19,950
Truth is,
I'm just so excited to be your steed.

302
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:21,994
I guess I just got carried away.

303
00:19:22,077 --> 00:19:24,746
And I'm sorry I dragged you
into this with me.

304
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:28,542
You were just a horse before I
accidentally zapped you with my sword.

305
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:32,504
If it weren't for me, you would've
been able to live out your days carefree

306
00:19:32,588 --> 00:19:34,548
in a nice pasture in Thaymor.

307
00:19:35,257 --> 00:19:38,719
Adora, I wouldn't trade my voice
and my wings for anything.

308
00:19:38,802 --> 00:19:41,346
I've got the chance
to change the world now.

309
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:46,268
To make it better than when I found it.
I can't imagine ever going back. Can you?

310
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:48,854
No, I don't think I can.

311
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:53,066
-[grunting and shouting]
-[laughs]

312
00:19:56,862 --> 00:19:57,696
Glimmer!

313
00:20:02,326 --> 00:20:05,454
Forget the princess, she's got no power!
Get him!

314
00:20:07,122 --> 00:20:09,249
I'm not as naive as you think.

315
00:20:11,084 --> 00:20:14,254
Turns out I saved a little magic,
just for you. [blows raspberry]

316
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:16,965
[shouts]

317
00:20:17,966 --> 00:20:19,384
[Catra] No!

318
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:29,937
-Is this...?
-Our Sacred Bond?

319
00:20:34,524 --> 00:20:37,277
This is it.
This is what I've been sensing.

320
00:20:37,361 --> 00:20:38,612
This is the epicenter.

321
00:20:38,695 --> 00:20:43,033
She-Ra destroyed this place,
now it's up to She-Ra to fix it.

322
00:20:43,116 --> 00:20:46,078
For the Honor of Grayskull!

323
00:21:30,914 --> 00:21:32,040
[groans]

324
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:35,502
Don't worry, I got this.

325
00:21:37,337 --> 00:21:40,674
-Loop-de-loops.
-Woo-hoo!

326
00:21:49,933 --> 00:21:51,601
[chuckles]

327
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:53,437
[She-Ra] Wow.

328
00:21:55,522 --> 00:21:59,067
Not a bad team.
Looks like we're getting the hang of this.

00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:06,908
Then I will be back to operation...

330
00:22:08,201 --> 00:22:10,829
My sensors indicate they fixed it.

331
00:22:11,079 --> 00:22:11,997
Good.

332
00:22:14,124 --> 00:22:17,085
At least we know for sure
that Entrapta's alive,

333
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:21,548
and working for the Horde,
making weapons to wipe us out.

-Guess what Swift Wind and I did today.

335
00:22:25,844 --> 00:22:29,848
We restored a First Ones' Watchtower
so Light Hope can balance the planet

336
00:22:29,931 --> 00:22:33,351
and we brought a field back to life and--
What happened to you?

337
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:38,774
Oh, Adora,
we've got a lot to catch you up on.
