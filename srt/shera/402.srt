1
00:00:18,101 --> 00:00:19,686
{\an8}[Adora] So, where's Glimmer again?

2
00:00:19,769 --> 00:00:21,187
{\an8}Didn't she call us here?

3
00:00:21,479 --> 00:00:23,940
{\an8}Uh, I'm sure she'll be here soon.

4
00:00:24,024 --> 00:00:24,858
{\an8}[both shouting]

5
00:00:24,941 --> 00:00:28,611
{\an8}-You're all here. Good. Just one second.
-Glimmer... [groans]

6
00:00:28,737 --> 00:00:32,574
{\an8}Oh, I see. She's really taking
this queen stuff seriously.

7
00:00:35,326 --> 00:00:39,581
{\an8}As part of my new anti-Horde strategy,
I'm sending you, Adora, Bow and Huntara

8
00:00:39,664 --> 00:00:42,625
to retrieve Mara's ship
from the Crimson Waste.

9
00:00:42,709 --> 00:00:45,754
Then, Bow will repair it
and then we'll have a spaceship.

10
00:00:45,837 --> 00:00:47,297
Take that, Horde.

11
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:49,257
-Uh, Glimmer?
-What?

12
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:51,760
The Crimson Waste is a desert.

13
00:00:51,843 --> 00:00:55,013
Doesn't Mermista need, like, water
to use her powers?

14
00:00:55,096 --> 00:00:56,639
[Mermista slurping straw]

15
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:01,311
Oh, good point.

16
00:01:01,394 --> 00:01:02,687
Be right back.

17
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:06,149
She gonna do that all the time now?

18
00:01:06,357 --> 00:01:08,234
-Oh, definitely.
-Did I hear the queen?

19
00:01:08,318 --> 00:01:11,279
She's needed
in the defense meeting immediately.

20
00:01:12,781 --> 00:01:14,866
Oh! Hello, everyone.

21
00:01:15,241 --> 00:01:17,077
What a wonderful...

22
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:18,536
[sneezes]

23
00:01:18,828 --> 00:01:21,039
interruption to my morning meditation

24
00:01:21,122 --> 00:01:24,751
and to see so much of our beautiful planet
before I've had my daily tea ceremony.

25
00:01:24,834 --> 00:01:28,379
Sorry, I may have gotten
a little lost on the way.

26
00:01:28,463 --> 00:01:31,800
But like I was saying,
the Waste has tons of plants

27
00:01:31,883 --> 00:01:35,303
-which you can use to bring the ship back.
-The Crimson Waste?

28
00:01:35,386 --> 00:01:36,429
That's the one.

29
00:01:36,513 --> 00:01:40,016
As my first act as queen,
I'm sending you all on the mission

30
00:01:40,099 --> 00:01:44,229
while I stay back
and do important queen duties.

31
00:01:44,312 --> 00:01:46,356
Hey, leave it all to us.

32
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:48,441
It'll probably be a boring mission anyway.

33
00:01:48,525 --> 00:01:49,400
[chuckles]

34
00:01:49,484 --> 00:01:52,195
Queen Glimmer, you are extremely late
for your next meeting.

35
00:01:52,737 --> 00:01:53,613

36
00:01:54,197 --> 00:01:56,199
-We'll go the fun way.

I'm not a princess.

Still, it must be nice to be home.

48
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:46,207
Do you miss it?

49
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:48,293
I left. Now I'm back.

-No need to make a big thing out of it.
-Mm-hm.

You, um, make flowers?

52
00:02:57,135 --> 00:02:58,595
I control all plants.

00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:22,452
Blessed.

62
00:03:23,786 --> 00:03:27,206
If we run into trouble, is flower girl
gonna be able to handle herself?

63
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:28,166
Oh, Perfuma?

64
00:03:28,249 --> 00:03:30,251
Oh, yeah, she's a demon in battle.

00:03:34,422 --> 00:03:36,215

-A bracelet?
-No.

This is how I'll carry my sword
from now on.

00:03:43,806 --> 00:03:45,308
It's pretty great, right?

71
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:48,394
I know you trained with the Horde, too,

72
00:03:48,478 --> 00:03:53,107
but I think all this time
with the princesses has made you soft.

73
00:03:53,191 --> 00:03:54,192

Are you serious? I'm as tough as ever.
I bet I can beat you to the ship.

[snorts] Never gonna happen.

78
00:04:15,838 --> 00:04:16,923
Ah.

79
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:18,925
Here, let me help.

80
00:04:20,218 --> 00:04:21,386
What are you...?

81
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:23,554
[shouting]

82
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:27,100
I'm trying to expand my arsenal
with new tech. What do you think?

83
00:04:27,183 --> 00:04:29,435
Why would you have an arrow for this?

84
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:31,938
It just seems like there are easier ways.

85
00:04:32,897 --> 00:04:35,108
Your intention was kind. Thank you.

86
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:36,901
Wanna talk about it?

87
00:04:36,985 --> 00:04:40,613
I'm trying to be zen about this,
but if I'm being honest,

88
00:04:40,697 --> 00:04:44,200
and I always try to speak my truth,
I just don't get cacti.

89
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:46,202
They're so rough and unfriendly.

90
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:49,956
Well, maybe if you give cacti a chance,

91
00:04:50,039 --> 00:04:52,625
you'll find that under that rough surface

92
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:54,419
she's a really great friend.

93
00:04:54,502 --> 00:04:55,420
Huh?

94
00:04:56,462 --> 00:04:59,966
Uh... This cacti thing
is about Huntara, right?

95
00:05:00,049 --> 00:05:03,052
What? No, I really mean cacti.

96
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:06,139
They're the one plant I can't control
or keep alive.

97
00:05:06,222 --> 00:05:09,934
Everyone says they're so easy,
but you still have to water them,

98
00:05:10,018 --> 00:05:13,354
and I always under water
and then over water. And I...

That's better. I'm-- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

102
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:23,448
I greet each dawn
with a centering morning ritual

103
00:05:23,531 --> 00:05:27,994
to make sure I am my best self,
but today my ritual was interrupted.

104
00:05:28,077 --> 00:05:30,997
And now I am here, surrounded by cacti.

105
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,249
Cacti that hate me. [sobbing]

106
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:36,085
How am I ever gonna use them
to move the ship?

107
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:38,129
Uh...

108
00:05:38,504 --> 00:05:41,090
That may not matter.

109
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:46,304
[panting]

110
00:05:46,637 --> 00:05:49,640
I can't--
I can't believe the Horde took the ship.

111
00:05:50,391 --> 00:05:52,060
Also, I could've run more.

112
00:05:53,061 --> 00:05:55,897
Or it could've been any number
of Crimson Waste scavengers,

113
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:57,607
and I could have run more.

114
00:05:57,690 --> 00:06:01,360
Gosh, well, I guess
we'll just have to come back another time.

115
00:06:01,903 --> 00:06:03,237
[device beeping]

116
00:06:03,946 --> 00:06:05,073
Yeah, I'm ready.

117
00:06:05,656 --> 00:06:06,991
Sorry, it's my pad.

118
00:06:07,075 --> 00:06:09,410
I souped it up so Glimmer can check in.

121
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:16,250
-[Adora] No. Hang up. Bow. Turn it off.
-Well, there's a small problem--

122
00:06:16,334 --> 00:06:18,169
No, Bow. Stop it.

123
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:19,837
<i>What's Adora doing?</i>

124
00:06:20,588 --> 00:06:21,589
Dancing.

125
00:06:21,672 --> 00:06:26,052
Because, uh, the mission
is going just so great.

126
00:06:26,135 --> 00:06:29,514
But we, um, have to go
do more mission stuff now.

127
00:06:29,597 --> 00:06:32,100
-Talk later, bye.
<i>-Wait, don't...</i>

128
00:06:33,184 --> 00:06:35,103
There's no reason to worry her.

129
00:06:35,186 --> 00:06:36,229
We'll find the ship.

130
00:06:36,312 --> 00:06:38,106
This is my home turf.

131
00:06:38,189 --> 00:06:41,067
Huntara can track anything in the Waste.

132
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:42,819
I'm an expert tracker, too.

133
00:06:43,444 --> 00:06:47,031
Then you know, it's all in the sand.

134
00:06:48,991 --> 00:06:51,452
Mm-hm. Rubber, mechanical.

135
00:06:52,203 --> 00:06:54,247
You may be right, it was the Horde.

136
00:06:55,289 --> 00:06:58,626
Uh-huh. Definitely,
definitely getting rubber.

137
00:06:58,709 --> 00:07:01,254
And, uh, sand.

138
00:07:02,505 --> 00:07:04,841
We could also,
you know, just follow these.

139
00:07:16,144 --> 00:07:18,062
Oh, of course.

140
00:07:18,354 --> 00:07:19,647
I should have known.

141
00:07:20,231 --> 00:07:21,441
Uh...

142
00:07:21,524 --> 00:07:24,777
Should you, though?
Because I don't see anything.

143
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:28,823
-Oh, well, we tried!
-Don't give up yet, flower girl.

The Valley of the Lost.

146

It's a smuggler's haven, and my home.

149
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:57,393
How are we supposed to find
anything in there?

150
00:07:57,477 --> 00:08:00,062
This has been
my gang's base since I arrived here.

151
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:02,565
Nothing can hide from me in this valley.

152
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:07,445
[laughs]

153
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:14,494
[woman] Come back here.

No.

159
00:08:35,223 --> 00:08:38,935
-Shh. Catra's goons are here.
-They're not her goons.

160
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:40,436
They're my goons.

161
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:43,356
I just never got a chance to fire them.
I'll fix that now.

162
00:08:43,439 --> 00:08:45,900
Maybe it's best to avoid confrontation?

163
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:48,319
You're afraid to fight, flower girl?

164
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:50,238
No, Perfuma's right.

165
00:08:50,613 --> 00:08:53,032
There's sure to be others.
We'll be outnumbered.

166
00:08:53,115 --> 00:08:54,784
I don't like not fighting.

167
00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:56,077
Understood.

168
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:58,204
But finding the ship is our mission.

169
00:08:58,287 --> 00:09:00,665
[woman] They went this way. Over here.

170
00:09:00,748 --> 00:09:02,458
[Horde soldiers grunting]

171
00:09:04,627 --> 00:09:07,213
The Valley is crawling
with Horde soldiers.

172
00:09:07,296 --> 00:09:09,340
And we still don't know where the ship is.

173
00:09:09,423 --> 00:09:11,050
This is still my home.

174
00:09:11,133 --> 00:09:12,969
And I know who can help.

175
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:17,390
Careful. We need this junk intact

176
00:09:17,473 --> 00:09:19,183
so Hordak can make new weapons.

177
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:22,186
[Scorpia] Oh, I am so sorry about that.

178
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:24,730
This isn't what I want
to be happening right now.

179
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:26,148
Okay. Sorry, sorry.

180
00:09:30,361 --> 00:09:32,572
-That was fast.
-What, did you miss me already?

181
00:09:33,197 --> 00:09:35,491
-Just don't drop anything else.
-No.

182
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:37,618
These guys look like
they've got it covered.

183
00:09:37,702 --> 00:09:40,371
[clicks] I'd rather hang out
in here with you.

184
00:09:41,289 --> 00:09:42,456
[groans]

185
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:44,292
What is going on?

186
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:47,795
Again, I am just so sorry about-- [shouts]

187
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,088
[Scorpia gasps]

188
00:09:49,171 --> 00:09:52,425
Okay. This is...
This is a thing that I'm seeing.

189
00:09:52,508 --> 00:09:54,552
Are you also seeing two of me?

190
00:09:54,635 --> 00:09:56,429
[gasps] Oh, I have a twin.

191
00:09:56,512 --> 00:10:00,558
I felt this emptiness and like there was
someone who would just understand.

192
00:10:00,641 --> 00:10:03,311
Oh, this is making so much sense to me.

193
00:10:03,477 --> 00:10:06,022
Ugh. Who am I kidding?
Hordak probably cloned me.

194
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:08,441
I signed a lot of paperwork at some point.

195
00:10:10,026 --> 00:10:11,485
Yeah, being quiet now.

196
00:10:11,569 --> 00:10:14,071
Who are you
and what exactly are you trying to pull?

197
00:10:16,741 --> 00:10:17,783
[screams]

198
00:10:18,701 --> 00:10:19,535
[gasps]

199
00:10:25,374 --> 00:10:28,002
Are you sure we can trust her contact?

200
00:10:28,085 --> 00:10:29,253
You scared?

201
00:10:29,337 --> 00:10:30,796
Of course not.

202
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,382
Good, because we're here.

203
00:10:35,801 --> 00:10:38,220
Ugh. Who would pay for this junk?

204
00:10:38,846 --> 00:10:41,682
Fools, just like you.

205
00:10:42,808 --> 00:10:43,893
You shouldn't be here.

206
00:10:44,852 --> 00:10:45,895
It's not safe.

207
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:46,937
Hurry.

208
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:50,191
Grox, what's going on? Where's the gang?

209
00:10:50,274 --> 00:10:51,400
Hiding.

210
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:54,904
The Waste has been infested
with Horde scum since you left.

211
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:58,866
Can't turn without running into them,
interfering with business.

212
00:10:59,867 --> 00:11:02,745
-[grunts]
-Things here haven't been easy.

213
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:05,748
You're a real sight for sore eyes.

214
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:06,791
You, too.

215
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:10,169
Grox, I need your help.
We're looking for a ship.

216
00:11:10,753 --> 00:11:12,797
And I got just the thing to help.

217
00:11:18,219 --> 00:11:19,220
Aha.

218
00:11:19,303 --> 00:11:20,262
Found it.

219
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:25,684
Now, before I do this, Huntara,
I need you to remember one thing.

220
00:11:25,768 --> 00:11:28,771
One very important thing you forgot.

221
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:31,440
This is the Crimson Waste.

222
00:11:31,607 --> 00:11:33,776
Trust no one.

223
00:11:33,943 --> 00:11:35,945
[blowing horn]

224
00:11:36,237 --> 00:11:38,239
I've got the Rebel intruders.

225
00:11:39,073 --> 00:11:40,324
You sold us out?

226
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:41,450
[laughing]

227
00:11:41,742 --> 00:11:42,827
Look at you.

228
00:11:43,327 --> 00:11:46,122
The Huntara I knew
would've seen this coming.

229
00:11:46,622 --> 00:11:49,250
You've gone soft.

230
00:11:50,876 --> 00:11:54,505
-[woman] They're in there. Come on.
-Leave her. We have to go.

231
00:11:54,797 --> 00:11:56,257
I'll be back for you.

232
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:57,925
Run along now.

233
00:11:58,008 --> 00:11:59,927
That's what you're good at.

234
00:12:03,931 --> 00:12:05,307
They went out the back.

235
00:12:08,644 --> 00:12:11,689
Looks like there's no
avoiding a fight now, Princess.

236
00:12:11,772 --> 00:12:13,816
For the honor of Grayskull.

237
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:19,238
Perfuma, cactus, block off this alley
so they can't surround us.

238
00:12:22,783 --> 00:12:23,951
You can do this.

239
00:12:24,034 --> 00:12:25,536
You can do this.

240
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:32,793
[shouting]

241
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,295
I can't do this.

242
00:12:38,549 --> 00:12:39,592
[Huntara] Run.

243
00:12:40,801 --> 00:12:42,178
[grunting]

244
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:53,814
[device beeping]

245
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:56,484
Bow, turn it off.

246
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:59,570
<i>Ugh. I'm in the middle</i>
<i>of the most boring meeting.</i>

247
00:12:59,653 --> 00:13:00,779
[whispering] Can't talk.

248
00:13:00,863 --> 00:13:03,073
We're being chased
through a smuggler's den.

249
00:13:03,157 --> 00:13:06,076
[gasps] <i>You are? That sounds so fun.</i>

250
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,244
Quiet that thing.

251
00:13:07,328 --> 00:13:09,997
-I'm gonna have to call you back.
<i>-Don't hang...</i>

252
00:13:11,332 --> 00:13:12,791
Pleasure to meet you.

253
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:14,793
The name's Double Trouble.

254
00:13:14,877 --> 00:13:17,630
And I'm about to become
your new best friend.

255
00:13:18,255 --> 00:13:22,051
-Oh, yeah? I'm done with best friends.
-Mm?

256
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:24,136
[scoffs]

257
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:25,638
Enough games.

258
00:13:26,805 --> 00:13:28,140
What do you want from me?

259
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:32,603
It's not what I want from you,
but what you want from me.

260
00:13:32,686 --> 00:13:36,190
All I want from you
is for you to stop being me.

261
00:13:36,273 --> 00:13:37,608
Oh, sorry.

262
00:13:37,691 --> 00:13:38,817
I plain forgot.

263
00:13:38,901 --> 00:13:41,946
Sometimes I just get so lost
in my character.

264
00:13:44,573 --> 00:13:45,741
Ta-da!

265
00:13:45,824 --> 00:13:47,785
Thank you, thank you.

266
00:13:47,868 --> 00:13:49,203
[gasps]

267
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:50,621
I gotta sit down.

268
00:13:51,997 --> 00:13:54,333
-This is what you really look like?
-More or less.

269
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,669
Of course, we all wear costumes.

270
00:13:56,752 --> 00:13:59,922
I just happen to be able to wear
other people as costumes.

271
00:14:00,005 --> 00:14:01,423
For a price.

272
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:03,342
Huh. So it's money you're after.

273
00:14:03,425 --> 00:14:04,760
[laughing]

274
00:14:04,843 --> 00:14:06,303
Aren't we all, darling?

275
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:09,890
But if you don't require
someone with my gifts,

276
00:14:10,307 --> 00:14:12,518
I'll just take my business
to the other side.

277
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:15,271
How exactly
are you planning on doing that?

278
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:18,941
I have a knack
for getting out of tight spots.

279
00:14:19,024 --> 00:14:22,611
-What?
-And you can change into anyone? Anytime?

280
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:24,572
Ugh. "Change"?

281
00:14:24,655 --> 00:14:27,616
What I do is so much more than changing.

282
00:14:28,158 --> 00:14:30,244
I prefer "transform."

283
00:14:30,327 --> 00:14:33,247
My real gift is committing to my roles.

284
00:14:33,497 --> 00:14:37,543
Sure, I can physically replicate anyone,
but that doesn't mean a thing

285
00:14:37,626 --> 00:14:39,795
if you can't be them emotionally.

286
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:41,255
It's an art.

287
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:44,341
[woman] Rebels. In the valley.

288
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:54,184
Perfuma, what happened back there?

289
00:14:54,268 --> 00:14:57,062
[grunting] I hate cacti.

290
00:14:57,146 --> 00:14:58,355
There, I said it.

291
00:14:58,439 --> 00:15:02,109
I love and honor all things, except cacti.

292
00:15:02,192 --> 00:15:04,445
And I don't like spitting
or Crimson Waste.

293
00:15:04,528 --> 00:15:06,655
It is full of negative energy.

294
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:08,866
Well, it wasn't always like this.

295
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:10,826
It used to be a great place,

296
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:13,245
where an honest criminal
could carve out a life.

297
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:15,122
Well, it's terrible now.

298
00:15:15,497 --> 00:15:16,665
I know.

299
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:18,250
Ouch.

300
00:15:19,793 --> 00:15:20,920
[device beeping]

301
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:23,881
<i>Did you seriously hang up on me?</i>

302
00:15:23,964 --> 00:15:26,967
Yeah, but just because
we were running from the Horde.

303
00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:30,429
And now we're hiding from the Horde.
Also, the Horde has Mara's ship.

304
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:32,598
-[grunts]
-Sorry.

305
00:15:32,681 --> 00:15:35,809
-We totally have it under--
<i>-Really? This is so cool.</i>

306
00:15:35,893 --> 00:15:37,186
<i>A dire situation.</i>

307
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:38,604
<i>Odds against us.</i>

308
00:15:38,687 --> 00:15:41,023
<i>I can't believe I'm missing this</i>
<i>for a dumb meeting.</i>

309
00:15:41,106 --> 00:15:42,858
<i>Okay, hang tight. I'm on my way.</i>

310
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:44,360
Wait, Glimmer, don't--

311
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:46,320
We can't wait for Glimmer.

312
00:15:46,403 --> 00:15:49,406
The Horde's probably going to take
the ship, whatever they can get,

313
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:50,783
back to the Fright Zone.

314
00:15:50,866 --> 00:15:53,786
I think I know how to find it.
We'll use this.

315
00:15:56,121 --> 00:15:58,832
Horde badges
have tracking devices built in.

316
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:02,294
That's how they found Catra
when we kidnapped her.

317
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:04,046
I can hack into their system

318
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:07,508
and see where all of the Horde soldiers
are in the valley.

319
00:16:07,591 --> 00:16:09,426
They're sure to be with the ship.

320
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:11,762
And there's our ship.

321
00:16:15,766 --> 00:16:19,478
I have a plan,
but it's gonna depend on you, Perfuma.

322
00:16:19,561 --> 00:16:22,147
We should come up
with a different plan then.

323
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:25,818
Come on, Perfuma,
you're one of the strongest people I know.

324
00:16:25,943 --> 00:16:28,570
If you hadn't rescued me
in the Battle of Bright Moon,

325
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:30,197
I wouldn't be here now.

326
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:32,783
Or me.
You rescued me from the Fright Zone.

327
00:16:32,866 --> 00:16:34,576
We're not in the Fright Zone.

328
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:38,080
We're here,
and I'm just a useless flower girl.

329
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:40,833
[Huntara] No, you're not.

330
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:45,004
I've been wrong about a lot.
I was wrong to leave my home.

331
00:16:45,087 --> 00:16:46,588
I was wrong about Grox.

332
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:51,051
And I hope I'm wrong about you
because we need your help.

333
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:53,595
You want my help?

334
00:16:56,765 --> 00:16:57,599
[chuckles]

335
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:02,438
For the honor of Grayskull.

336
00:17:22,332 --> 00:17:23,542
Hello.

337
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:26,295
[grunting and shouting]

338
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:42,561
[Catra] Hey.

339
00:17:42,644 --> 00:17:44,188
Careful with the goods.

340
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:11,882
[groaning]

341
00:18:17,846 --> 00:18:19,640
Focus. Um, uh...

342
00:18:20,349 --> 00:18:22,976
[humming] Right? Do it with me.

343
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:24,269
[both humming]

344
00:18:24,394 --> 00:18:25,479
You got it. All right.

345
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:27,606
Yeah, yeah.

346
00:18:31,568 --> 00:18:34,321
I'm not strong enough
to lift this by myself.

347
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:38,117
[gasps] I don't have to be.

348
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,952
We're underground.

349
00:18:40,035 --> 00:18:41,829
You're just noticing that now?

350
00:18:41,912 --> 00:18:43,914
You know what else is underground?

351
00:18:43,997 --> 00:18:45,207
Roots.

352
00:18:51,255 --> 00:18:52,339
[grunting]

353
00:19:00,722 --> 00:19:01,807
[gasps]

354
00:19:07,604 --> 00:19:11,859
These cacti have the most powerful
root system I've ever seen.

355
00:19:11,942 --> 00:19:14,653
I was so wrong about them.

356
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:18,365
[Huntara] And I was definitely wrong
about you, flower girl.

357
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:23,203
[grunting and shouting]

358
00:19:34,423 --> 00:19:35,257
[gasps]

359
00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:36,967
We have a problem.

360
00:19:55,402 --> 00:19:57,446
I got something more important to do.

361
00:19:57,529 --> 00:19:59,406
It was fun distracting you, though.

362
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:19,801
[shouting]

363
00:20:47,371 --> 00:20:49,081
-Oh.
-[laughing]

364
00:20:55,629 --> 00:20:57,589
How did she get out of that?

365
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:00,384
-Yeah.
-Yes. We did it.

366
00:21:01,176 --> 00:21:03,595
-I'm sorry I doubted you.
-It's all right.

367
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:06,265
We're all on a journey
of personal growth today.

368
00:21:06,348 --> 00:21:08,517
I was so wrong to insult your home.

369
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:12,521
It turns out cacti have flowers too.

370
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:20,195
[shouts]

371
00:21:21,446 --> 00:21:24,366
Hey, you didn't save any bad guys for me.

372
00:21:24,449 --> 00:21:28,161
I made it here as soon as I could.
I only got a little lost, in the ocean.

373
00:21:28,787 --> 00:21:29,663
Aw.

374
00:21:29,788 --> 00:21:33,417
-You should've waited for me.
-Sorry, but we did get the ship.

375
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:36,670
Your first mission as queen is a success.

376
00:21:38,088 --> 00:21:38,964
Hmm.

377
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:43,385
Queen Glimmer, I need to stay,
and take the Waste back for the Rebellion,

378
00:21:43,468 --> 00:21:44,845
and for my people.

379
00:21:44,928 --> 00:21:46,596
I won't abandon my home again.

380
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,515
Aw, say no, Glimmer.

381
00:21:48,932 --> 00:21:52,144
I've gotten fond of this desert rose.

382
00:21:52,227 --> 00:21:55,188
Let anyone hear you calling me that

383
00:21:55,272 --> 00:21:58,442
and I'll throw you
into another exploding cactus.

384
00:22:00,193 --> 00:22:01,945
[both laughing]

385
00:22:02,029 --> 00:22:03,113
[all laughing]

386
00:22:05,282 --> 00:22:06,241
I don't get it.

387
00:22:06,491 --> 00:22:07,909
You had to be there.

388
00:22:13,373 --> 00:22:14,750
Wow. [chuckles]

389
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:16,418
Bravo. Yes.

390
00:22:16,501 --> 00:22:17,878
Oh, stop.

391
00:22:20,881 --> 00:22:22,799
Did you really like my audition?

392
00:22:22,883 --> 00:22:24,885
Like doesn't cover it.

393
00:22:24,968 --> 00:22:27,512
Well, I could've used more time
to prepare.

394
00:22:28,055 --> 00:22:30,265
Really get into your skin.

395
00:22:30,348 --> 00:22:33,185
-I grew up with Adora and you fooled her.
-[gasps]

396
00:22:34,603 --> 00:22:37,355
If you can do that, we can do anything.

397
00:22:38,065 --> 00:22:39,357
This is gonna be fun.

398
00:22:42,527 --> 00:22:44,071
[closing theme playing]
