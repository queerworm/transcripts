{\an8}Yeah, I see her, Bow.

00:00:58,516 --> 00:01:02,187
{\an8}Okay. I wanted to make sure
it wasn't just me.

00:01:21,539 --> 00:01:23,833
What do you mean what did <i>I</i> do to you?

19
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:26,044
I didn't know
being a princess was contagious!

20
00:01:26,127 --> 00:01:28,880
Okay, okay, everyone, calm down!

21
00:01:29,589 --> 00:01:32,217
{\an8}-Wanna tell us how you did that?
-I didn't do anything.

22
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:35,470
{\an8}All I did was pick up the sword,
and then, woosh, I'm in a tiara!

{\an8}I don't care how she did it.

she never does it again!

Do it again!

Bow!

30
00:02:02,038 --> 00:02:03,206
Do what you did before.

31
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:06,292

-No time. We have to go.

What is this place?

35
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:29,357
No idea, but in there's gotta be better
than out here.

36
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:37,365
[grunting]

37
00:02:37,448 --> 00:02:39,617
Everyone, grab on, I can get us in there!

38
00:02:39,701 --> 00:02:42,579
Glimmer, no! You've never teleported
three people before.

39
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:44,622
-Do you have a better idea?
-[both gasp]

40
00:02:46,249 --> 00:02:49,419
What's written on this door?
It looks like some kind of password.

41
00:02:49,502 --> 00:02:51,129
You can read that?

42
00:02:51,212 --> 00:02:52,297
You can't?

43
00:02:54,507 --> 00:02:56,926
-What's it say?
-Uh, "Eternia."

44
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:02,223
Oh, come on!

45
00:03:11,149 --> 00:03:15,361
So, Horde soldier, have you always
been able to read First Ones writing?

46
00:03:16,362 --> 00:03:18,698
Wanna tell us what exactly
is going on here?

47
00:03:18,781 --> 00:03:22,285
I told you I don't know.
I just read the word on the door.

48
00:03:22,368 --> 00:03:23,995
Right...

49
00:03:24,078 --> 00:03:29,000
[chuckles] You read a word in a language
that no one's spoken for a thousand years,

50
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:33,379
and the door just opened
into a mysterious ancient ruin.

51
00:03:33,463 --> 00:03:34,547
Sure.

52
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:38,176
You think I did this on purpose?
You think I wanted to be a princess?

53
00:03:38,259 --> 00:03:40,345
Princesses are monsters!

54
00:03:40,428 --> 00:03:41,846
Monsters?

55
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:43,973
-You're the monster!
-Whoa, whoa.

56
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:46,643
-Glimmer, she did save us.
-I don't care!

57
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:48,561
We can't trust her, Bow.

58
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:51,898
Have you forgotten everything
the Horde's done to us?

59
00:03:51,981 --> 00:03:53,691
The people we've lost.

60
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:55,151
[Glimmer sobbing]

61
00:03:56,027 --> 00:03:59,322
We need to find another way out of here
and get her back to Bright Moon soon.

62
00:03:59,405 --> 00:04:01,866
My mother will know what to do with her.

63
00:04:02,408 --> 00:04:05,536
Hey, so, thanks for saving us
from that bug thing back there

64
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:09,582
-when you could've escaped instead.
-Okay, well, I didn't save you.

65
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:11,834
I wanted to get the sword, okay?

66
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:14,587
Are you sure it's not
because you secretly like us?

67
00:04:14,671 --> 00:04:18,091
[chuckles] Wh--? I don't like you.
You're my captors.

68
00:04:18,174 --> 00:04:19,342
Sure.

69
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:23,096
Thanks for saving us anyway.
I'm Bow, by the way.

70
00:04:24,013 --> 00:04:25,014
Adora.

71
00:04:25,473 --> 00:04:28,935
"Adora." Ah.
Weird name for a Horde soldier.

72
00:04:29,018 --> 00:04:29,852
Is it?

73
00:04:31,479 --> 00:04:33,731
[whispers] For the honor of Grayskull.

74
00:04:35,858 --> 00:04:38,945
-What are we doing?
-Nothing! I mean, uh...

75
00:04:39,028 --> 00:04:42,699
Look at these carvings.
I think this might be a First Ones ruin.

76
00:04:43,157 --> 00:04:44,492
What's a First One?

77
00:04:44,575 --> 00:04:47,245
You've never heard of the First Ones?

78
00:04:47,912 --> 00:04:51,165
The First Ones
are the original settlers of Etheria.

79
00:04:51,249 --> 00:04:53,209
They disappeared a thousand years ago,

80
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:56,879
but they left behind a lot of old ruins
and technology. Like this place.

81
00:04:57,422 --> 00:04:59,132
So, what happened to them?

82
00:04:59,215 --> 00:05:03,553
No one knows. They just disappeared.
The Horde didn't tell you about them?

83
00:05:03,636 --> 00:05:06,097
Seems like there's a lot
the Horde didn't tell me.

84
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:08,141
Ugh. How do we get out of here?

85
00:05:09,767 --> 00:05:13,187
[sighs] It'll take forever
to find a way out at this rate.

86
00:05:13,271 --> 00:05:15,690
[gasps] Hey, you wanna turn on
some lights, Adora?

87
00:05:16,065 --> 00:05:19,110
-I don't know how to do that.
-Maybe there's a magic word.

88
00:05:19,193 --> 00:05:21,696
Ooh, what's the First Ones' word
for "lights"?

89
00:05:21,779 --> 00:05:24,949
-I don't know. I'm not magic.
-[Glimmer] Obviously.

90
00:05:25,366 --> 00:05:26,993
Everyone, stand back.

91
00:05:27,076 --> 00:05:29,537
Uh, Glimmer?
Maybe you should take it easy.

92
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:33,249
We're a long way from Bright Moon.
It'll be a while until you can recharge.

93
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:35,501
-Bow!
-You have to recharge your powers?

94
00:05:35,585 --> 00:05:38,671
Can we not talk about this
in front of the Horde soldier?

95
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:39,881
Now, stand back.

96
00:05:45,094 --> 00:05:46,637
[grunting]

97
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:54,687
Whoa. [gasps]

98
00:05:55,063 --> 00:05:57,065
-[Glimmer groans]
-Wow, are you okay?

99
00:05:57,148 --> 00:05:59,067
I'm fine, Bow.

100
00:06:06,491 --> 00:06:08,993
Oh, hey! That's you!

101
00:06:09,077 --> 00:06:11,162
What?
That doesn't look anything like me.

102
00:06:11,245 --> 00:06:14,999
No, I mean, the other you.
The scary one in the cape.

103
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:17,168
That was me?

104
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:23,633
You can read that inscription, right?
What's it say?

105
00:06:23,716 --> 00:06:24,759
It says...

106
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:26,844
"She-Ra."

107
00:06:41,776 --> 00:06:44,153
-[Light Hope] <i>Greetings, administrator.</i>
-What is this thing?

108
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:45,696
<i>What is your query?</i>

109
00:06:46,114 --> 00:06:48,574
Think it's some kind of ancient hologram.

110
00:06:49,117 --> 00:06:50,159
<i>What is your query?</i>

111
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:51,536
Uh...

112
00:06:51,619 --> 00:06:53,996
Hi. What is this place?

113
00:06:56,082 --> 00:07:00,002
How do we get out of here?

114
00:07:00,795 --> 00:07:03,047
<i>-What is your query?</i>
-She's broken.

115
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:07,051
She's old. I'm surprised
any of this stuff still works at all.

116
00:07:07,135 --> 00:07:09,303
<i>Administrator not detected.</i>

117
00:07:09,387 --> 00:07:11,139
<i>Lockdown initiated.</i>

118
00:07:19,564 --> 00:07:22,942
-I didn't do it!
-No. No lockdown!

119
00:07:25,528 --> 00:07:28,698
-Adora, you gotta get it to stop!
-What makes you think I can?

120
00:07:28,781 --> 00:07:32,493
<i>-Query not recognized.</i>
-There's gotta be a password or something!

121
00:07:32,869 --> 00:07:34,370
Uh, stop it!

122
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:36,038
Uh, Eternia!

123
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:37,039
Eternia!

124
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:41,252
-Give me the sword.
-What? No!

125
00:07:41,335 --> 00:07:43,045
We need the scary lady in the cape.

126
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:45,381
I don't know how,
but she's the key to this place,

127
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:46,632
so maybe she can get us out.

128
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:51,053
You're a Horde soldier.
I'm not giving you the sword.

129
00:07:51,804 --> 00:07:52,805
[shouting]

130
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:54,056
Eternia!

131
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:55,391
Uh, cape!

132
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:57,435
Uh... She-Ra!

133
00:08:01,939 --> 00:08:04,275
-Hold on!
-Glimmer, no!

134
00:08:07,195 --> 00:08:08,446
[screaming]

135
00:08:10,031 --> 00:08:11,407
Glimmer!

136
00:08:17,455 --> 00:08:18,414
Glimmer?

137
00:08:19,248 --> 00:08:20,208
Glimmer?

138
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:21,584
[groans]

139
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:22,793
Did it work?

140
00:08:22,877 --> 00:08:23,836
[chuckles]

141
00:08:24,086 --> 00:08:26,547
Yeah, it worked. Barely.

142
00:08:26,631 --> 00:08:29,258
-Are you all right?
-I'm fine. [groans]

143
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:32,011
I think I used too much power
getting us out of there.

144
00:08:32,094 --> 00:08:35,806
I don't know who could've
predicted that... Oh, right. Me.

145
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:37,308
-Bow...
-Like an hour ago.

146
00:08:37,391 --> 00:08:38,226
Bow!

147
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:40,561
Sorry. I'm just glad you're okay.

148
00:08:40,645 --> 00:08:43,814
No more teleporting.
You could really hurt yourself.

149
00:08:43,898 --> 00:08:45,066
I'm fine, okay?

150
00:08:45,149 --> 00:08:48,277
Let's just get back to Bright Moon
so I can recharge already.

151
00:08:49,445 --> 00:08:51,280
-Why are you still here?
-What?

152
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:54,033
Bow and I are hardly
a crack security team.

153
00:08:54,116 --> 00:08:56,953
You could've escaped at any time.
Why didn't you?

154
00:08:57,662 --> 00:09:01,457
I just-- I wanna figure out
what's happening to me,

155
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:04,961
and if I go back to the Fright Zone,
then I'll never know.

156
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:08,381
I never knew where I came from
or who my family was.

157
00:09:08,464 --> 00:09:10,800
Shadow Weaver said it didn't matter
who I was before,

158
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:13,386
that I was nothing
before Hordak took me in.

159
00:09:13,469 --> 00:09:17,390
There's always been a part of me
that I don't know anything about.

160
00:09:17,473 --> 00:09:21,269
And all of this,
it feels familiar somehow.

161
00:09:21,811 --> 00:09:24,063
I don't know how else to explain it.

162
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:32,488
Glimmer's mom knows more
about First Ones' tech than anyone.

163
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:35,575
She'll know what's going on
with you and the sword for sure.

164
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:39,829
So, if you want your questions answered,
stick with us?

165
00:09:41,163 --> 00:09:44,500
Let's go. There should be a village
a few miles from here.

166
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:46,627
They'll be able to give us a ride
to Bright Moon.

167
00:09:46,711 --> 00:09:48,796
We've wasted too much time already.

168
00:09:54,844 --> 00:09:57,513
For the last time, where is Adora?

169
00:09:57,597 --> 00:10:01,642
For the last time, I don't know.
You think I keep her on a leash?

170
00:10:01,726 --> 00:10:02,977
I know you're lying.

171
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:06,230
You two are close. She would
never depart without telling you.

172
00:10:06,314 --> 00:10:09,483
-Then I guess she let us both down, huh?
-Have it your way.

173
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:11,902
I already know where she is.

174
00:10:11,986 --> 00:10:15,740
-We've been tracking her.
-Uh, then why did you ask me?

175
00:10:15,823 --> 00:10:18,909
Because you are going
to bring her back.

176
00:10:18,993 --> 00:10:20,995
I don't think so. [grunting]

177
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:27,376
Your insolence will not protect her.

178
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:29,754
You will do as I ask.

179
00:10:29,837 --> 00:10:31,422
Oh, yeah? Or what?

180
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:36,636
Or you will suffer the consequences
in her place.

181
00:10:38,721 --> 00:10:40,556
[chattering and laughing]

182
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:45,519
-Okay. The jacket comes off.
-That? Why?

183
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:49,690
Because if the villagers see
a Horde soldier, they'll freak out.

184
00:10:49,774 --> 00:10:52,818
So, we gotta fix... all this.

185
00:10:58,032 --> 00:10:59,575
I feel ridiculous.

186
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:02,411
That's because you need something
to tie it all together.

187
00:11:05,456 --> 00:11:06,666
I don't like it.

188
00:11:06,749 --> 00:11:09,502
The point is, you don't look
like a Horde soldier anymore.

189
00:11:09,585 --> 00:11:13,506
Just try and keep a low profile.
We'll be in and out.

190
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:18,177
-What is this?
-It's a festival.

191
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:19,929
You know, like a big party.

192
00:11:22,223 --> 00:11:24,934
You don't have parties
in the Fright Zone?

193
00:11:25,393 --> 00:11:28,229
Oh, right, parties.

194
00:11:28,312 --> 00:11:32,608
I mean, yeah, pfft, of course. I, uh--
I don't know what that is.

195
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:33,526
Ah!

196
00:11:33,609 --> 00:11:35,986
Did you even hear what I just said?
In and out, Bow!

197
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:38,614
She has never been
to a party before, Glimmer.

198
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:41,033
This is serious.

199
00:12:14,775 --> 00:12:16,152
[children cheering]

200
00:12:20,698 --> 00:12:21,782
[all gasp]

201
00:12:29,331 --> 00:12:30,624
[sighs]

202
00:12:31,792 --> 00:12:35,045
So, seriously? No parties ever?

203
00:12:35,379 --> 00:12:37,757
-What do you do on your birthday?
-Huh?

204
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,592
No birthdays?!

205
00:12:39,675 --> 00:12:43,387
How is your life this sad?

206
00:12:43,471 --> 00:12:44,638
[gasps]

207
00:12:44,722 --> 00:12:47,558
What is that?

208
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:51,854
That would be a horse.

209
00:12:52,396 --> 00:12:53,731
[neighs]

210
00:12:53,814 --> 00:12:55,399
It's majestic.

211
00:12:56,358 --> 00:12:58,819
-You wanna go meet it?
-What? No!

212
00:12:58,903 --> 00:13:00,237
[whining]

213
00:13:00,654 --> 00:13:03,657
Come on, it's okay. See, he likes you.

214
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:14,084
[gasps] This is the best day of my life.

215
00:13:15,336 --> 00:13:18,923
-Bow...
-Come on, I know you like her, too.

216
00:13:19,006 --> 00:13:20,424
[rumbling nearby]

217
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:22,635
[people screaming nearby]

218
00:13:23,427 --> 00:13:24,678
What's going on?

219
00:13:32,895 --> 00:13:34,313
It's the Horde!

220
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:40,778
Why are they here?
The people of Thaymor aren't a threat.

221
00:13:40,861 --> 00:13:44,406
Wait. Did you say Thaymor?
This can't be Thaymor.

222
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:47,827
-Did you know about this?
-No. I mean,

223
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:49,578
yes, but there's a mistake.

224
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:52,498
Thaymor's supposed to be
a heavily fortified rebel fortress,

225
00:13:52,581 --> 00:13:54,416
not a civilian town.

226
00:13:55,793 --> 00:13:57,837
Do you really think that matters to them?

227
00:13:59,922 --> 00:14:01,131
I can get them to stop.

228
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:04,093
This is a big mistake.
I just need to talk to them.

229
00:14:04,176 --> 00:14:07,096
Get as many people out as you can
and don't let them see you.

230
00:14:10,349 --> 00:14:11,517
I'm sorry.

231
00:14:12,101 --> 00:14:12,935
Adora!

232
00:14:24,154 --> 00:14:25,322
Stop!

233
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:31,036
-Adora!
-Catra?

234
00:14:32,288 --> 00:14:35,124
They let me drive a tank.
Can you believe it?

235
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:38,043
Catra, I don't understand.
Why are you here?

236
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:40,170
Uh, duh, we came to find you.

237
00:14:40,254 --> 00:14:43,549
"Cover for me, Catra.
No one will know I'm gone."

238
00:14:43,632 --> 00:14:45,718
Seriously, did you
just immediately get captured

239
00:14:45,801 --> 00:14:47,595
right after you snuck out or--?

240
00:14:48,012 --> 00:14:49,638
What are you wearing?

241
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:50,556
Uh...

242
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:04,320
Bow!

243
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:05,905
[shouting]

244
00:15:07,072 --> 00:15:07,907
Hey!

245
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:11,243
Look, there's no time.
We have to put a stop to this.

246
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:14,663
-What? Why?
-Because this is a civilian town.

247
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:18,459
Look around! These aren't insurgents,
they're innocent people!

248
00:15:18,542 --> 00:15:22,087
Yeah, sure. Innocent people
who kidnapped a Horde officer.

249
00:15:22,171 --> 00:15:24,423
Come on, let's get you back
to the Fright Zone.

250
00:15:24,506 --> 00:15:27,217
Shadow Weaver is freaking out.

251
00:15:27,301 --> 00:15:28,510
[laughing]

252
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:30,971
It'd be funny if she weren't
such a terrible person.

253
00:15:31,055 --> 00:15:32,097
Catra, no.

254
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:33,432
I can't go back.

255
00:15:33,515 --> 00:15:35,851
Not until the Horde
leaves this town alone.

256
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:37,227
You have to help me!

257
00:15:37,686 --> 00:15:39,104
What are you saying?

258
00:15:39,188 --> 00:15:40,856
I'm saying this is wrong.

259
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:43,359
They've been lying to us,
manipulating us.

260
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:45,736
Hordak, Shadow Weaver, all of them.

261
00:15:47,363 --> 00:15:49,657
Duh. You just figured that out?

262
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:52,076
Manipulation is
Shadow Weaver's whole thing.

263
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:55,120
She's been messing with our heads
since we were kids.

264
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:57,665
How could you be okay with that?

265
00:15:57,748 --> 00:16:01,502
Because. It doesn't matter what they do.
The two of us look out for each other.

266
00:16:01,585 --> 00:16:04,463
And soon we'll be the ones
calling the shots.

267
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:07,216
Now, can we go home already?

268
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:08,509
[gasps]

269
00:16:09,093 --> 00:16:13,430
I'm not going home, Catra. I can't.
Not after everything I've seen.

270
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:16,433
Come with me.
You don't have to go back there.

271
00:16:16,517 --> 00:16:17,935
We can fix this.

272
00:16:20,312 --> 00:16:21,563
Are you kidding?

273
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:24,650
You've known these people for,
what, a couple hours?

274
00:16:24,733 --> 00:16:28,070
And now you're gonna throw everything away
for them?

275
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:30,406
Ugh. What happened to you?

276
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:31,615
I don't know.

277
00:16:31,699 --> 00:16:35,202
But I have to do something.
I'm sorry, Catra.

278
00:16:35,494 --> 00:16:37,079
[yells]

279
00:16:43,043 --> 00:16:44,795
[Bow] I think that's all of them.

280
00:16:45,963 --> 00:16:47,172
Glimmer, let's go!

281
00:16:56,724 --> 00:16:59,852
-What are we gonna do?
-There's nothing we can do, Bow.

282
00:16:59,935 --> 00:17:02,855
You're almost out of arrows,
and I'm almost out of magic.

283
00:17:02,938 --> 00:17:05,190
You can't say that. You're Glimmer.

284
00:17:05,274 --> 00:17:08,027
You throw yourself into every fight,
no matter how hopeless.

285
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:10,404
Ugh. Every decision I've made
in the last day

286
00:17:10,487 --> 00:17:12,239
has almost gotten us killed.

287
00:17:12,322 --> 00:17:14,616
My mom's right,
I'm not ready for this yet.

288
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:17,411
No. You are not giving up now.

289
00:17:17,494 --> 00:17:21,081
I'm sorry your mom doesn't see
how strong you are, but that's her loss.

290
00:17:21,165 --> 00:17:24,835
You can do this, Glimmer.
And you don't have to do it alone.

291
00:17:26,462 --> 00:17:27,463
You're right.

292
00:17:28,172 --> 00:17:30,382
-We need Adora.
-We do?

293
00:17:30,466 --> 00:17:32,426
Didn't she just sell us out to the Horde?

294
00:17:32,509 --> 00:17:35,345
I don't think she did.
We need to find her.

295
00:17:35,429 --> 00:17:37,014
I think she can help us.

296
00:17:37,097 --> 00:17:38,348
Just trust me.

297
00:17:38,432 --> 00:17:39,349
Okay?

298
00:17:41,852 --> 00:17:43,270
[horse neighing]

299
00:17:48,317 --> 00:17:51,111
Oh, man.
That was a lot stronger than I thought.

300
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:52,780
Are you okay?

301
00:17:53,489 --> 00:17:54,782
Catra! [yells]

302
00:17:54,865 --> 00:17:56,617
I'm sorry! It was a reflex.

303
00:17:57,159 --> 00:17:59,453
Why are you doing this?

304
00:18:00,704 --> 00:18:02,206
Because you left me.

305
00:18:02,289 --> 00:18:05,209
And if I don't bring you back,
Shadow Weaver's gonna have my head.

306
00:18:05,292 --> 00:18:07,544
So enough
with your weird little identity crisis

307
00:18:07,628 --> 00:18:09,588
and let's go home already.

308
00:18:09,671 --> 00:18:11,840
Or do I need to zap you again? [shrieks]

309
00:18:16,053 --> 00:18:17,054
Glimmer?

310
00:18:17,846 --> 00:18:19,139
[growls]

311
00:18:20,724 --> 00:18:21,892
[grunting]

312
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:24,853
-Watch out!
-[shouting]

313
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:28,023
Adora!

314
00:18:28,649 --> 00:18:29,608
[yells]

315
00:18:36,573 --> 00:18:37,574
[groans]

316
00:18:40,452 --> 00:18:43,789
Glimmer? What are you doing?
Why did you save me?

317
00:18:44,206 --> 00:18:45,457
We need you.

318
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:49,962
We need She-Ra. I should've given
this back to you in the ruin.

319
00:18:50,587 --> 00:18:54,466
You could've saved us there
and I knew that. But I was stupid.

320
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:57,386
And a jerk, and I almost got us killed,
and I'm sorry.

321
00:18:57,469 --> 00:19:00,347
You're not. I'm the Horde soldier.

322
00:19:00,764 --> 00:19:02,307
How do you know you can trust me now?

323
00:19:03,308 --> 00:19:05,978
I don't. But I hope I can.

324
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:10,149
I feel like maybe you're here to help us.

325
00:19:21,869 --> 00:19:26,123
For the honor of Grayskull!

326
00:19:58,280 --> 00:19:59,865
[grunting]

327
00:20:10,167 --> 00:20:11,543
[neighing]

328
00:20:19,009 --> 00:20:21,845
It's been an honor
serving beside you, Horsey.

329
00:21:18,485 --> 00:21:20,570
Bow! Are you okay?

330
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:22,823
Is that Adora?

331
00:21:23,156 --> 00:21:24,491
It's She-Ra.

332
00:21:26,576 --> 00:21:27,619
[officer] Retreat!

333
00:21:27,703 --> 00:21:29,037
[all screaming]

334
00:21:50,267 --> 00:21:51,393
Catra.

335
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:01,320
You did it.

336
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:03,322
I did?

337
00:22:03,405 --> 00:22:06,491
You saved us. You saved everyone.

338
00:22:07,284 --> 00:22:08,952
[chuckles] I did it.

339
00:22:09,494 --> 00:22:13,248
I turned against the Horde!
I turned against the Horde.

340
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:16,835
Why did I do that? I can't go back now.
Where am I supposed to go?

341
00:22:16,918 --> 00:22:18,503
Hey, hey.

342
00:22:18,587 --> 00:22:21,214
It's okay. You're with us now.

343
00:22:22,299 --> 00:22:24,760
So, come on, let's go home.

344
