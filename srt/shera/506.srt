{\an8}[computer chimes]

3
00:00:23,106 --> 00:00:26,693
{\an8}Okay, I patched the shielding
on the aft starboard ancillary booster.

4
00:00:26,776 --> 00:00:27,694
Try it now.

5
00:00:27,777 --> 00:00:29,904
{\an8}I have no idea what that is.

6
00:00:30,238 --> 00:00:32,991
{\an8}I'm working on getting the autopilot up
and functional again.

7
00:00:33,158 --> 00:00:34,909
{\an8}Wrong Hordak, blowtorch.

8
00:00:36,911 --> 00:00:41,458
{\an8}What? We couldn't just leave him behind.
And he's harmless. You know, since I,

9
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:45,295
kind of, you know,
fried him and scrambled his brains.

10
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:49,549
How's Catra?

11
00:00:49,632 --> 00:00:53,011
Good, I think. I keep checking on her,
but she's been sleeping for a while.

12
00:00:53,094 --> 00:00:56,139
-Do you think I should check again?
-Adora, you should let her rest.

13
00:00:56,222 --> 00:00:57,265
Right, right.

14
00:00:58,641 --> 00:01:01,352
What if she needs something?
I'm just gonna go check on her.

15
00:01:02,353 --> 00:01:04,898
No, no, no, you're right.
Letting her rest.

16
00:01:05,023 --> 00:01:06,149
Come on, guys.

17
00:01:06,232 --> 00:01:08,860
We faced Horde Prime
and made it out alive.

18
00:01:08,943 --> 00:01:11,654
I honestly cannot believe it worked.

19
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:14,282
Plus, She-Ra's back.

20
00:01:14,491 --> 00:01:16,743
How did you do that without the sword?

21
00:01:16,826 --> 00:01:20,246
I don't know.
I just suddenly felt her again.

22
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:21,956
Like she'd never left.

23
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:25,585
Like she's been in there all along
just waiting to come out.

24
00:01:26,586 --> 00:01:29,422
-I just have no idea how to do it again.
-You'll figure it out.

25
00:01:29,672 --> 00:01:32,884
What's important is that she was there
when your friends needed her.

26
00:01:32,967 --> 00:01:36,679
Well, friends and one person
who threw me off a cliff, but sure.

27
00:01:37,096 --> 00:01:39,516
-I can't believe we're finally going home.
-[yelps]

28
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:42,435
Steering.

29
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:43,561
Sorry, sorry.

30
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:46,189
With Darla damaged,
our speed's at 30 percent.

31
00:01:46,272 --> 00:01:49,776
If Entrapta can't fix it,
it'll take a while to get there.

32
00:01:49,859 --> 00:01:54,614
As long as we're headed towards home,
and away from Horde Prime, I'm happy.

33
00:01:54,697 --> 00:01:59,077
We deserve to celebrate. I'm going
to make us a special dinner for tonight.

34
00:01:59,160 --> 00:01:59,994
You?

35
00:02:00,495 --> 00:02:02,622
I have never seen you cook before.

36
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:04,249
[chuckles]

37
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:07,502
You know what? Wrong Hordak can help.

38
00:02:07,919 --> 00:02:10,088
I bet he knows a lot about cooking.

39
00:02:10,296 --> 00:02:14,300
I am honored to provide nourishment
for my exalted brothers.

40
00:02:16,094 --> 00:02:18,346
-I'm gonna go check on Catra again.
-Adora.

41
00:02:20,265 --> 00:02:22,267
Okay, I can do this.

42
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:23,810

Hey. Hey, it's just me.

55
00:03:30,376 --> 00:03:32,378
Are you still getting the flashes?

56
00:03:32,837 --> 00:03:36,049
Yes, I keep having this horrible vision
of a blond girl

57
00:03:36,132 --> 00:03:39,177
who thinks she's better than everyone,
barging into my room all day.

58
00:03:40,094 --> 00:03:40,929
Oh, wait.

59
00:03:43,932 --> 00:03:45,642
We'll find a way to get the chip off.

60
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:48,686
If you'd just let Entrapta take a look
at it, I bet she could--

61
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:50,897
I don't wanna see anyone, okay?

62
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:55,193
Not you, not Arrow Boy, or Sparkles,
and definitely not Entrapta.

63
00:03:56,945 --> 00:03:59,447
So, you're just gonna hide
in here forever?

64
00:03:59,864 --> 00:04:02,951
-You'll have to face them sometime.
-No, I don't.

65
00:04:03,284 --> 00:04:06,162
Just drop me off on the closest planet.
I'll make my own way.

66
00:04:06,663 --> 00:04:09,165
What, so Horde Prime
can capture you again?

67
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:11,709
I can take care of myself.

68
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:18,591
I promised I'd take you home
and that's what I'm gonna do.

69
00:04:18,675 --> 00:04:21,844
Why are you acting like this?
We saved your life.

70
00:04:22,178 --> 00:04:23,846
I told you not to come back.

71
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:26,432
But you love
feeling like a hero, don't you?

72
00:04:26,516 --> 00:04:30,937
-You'd rather I left you there to die?
-What do you care? You all hate me.

73
00:04:31,354 --> 00:04:32,855
I never hated you.

74
00:04:35,817 --> 00:04:37,819
Then you're dumber than I thought.

75
00:04:39,237 --> 00:04:40,738
Just leave me alone.

76
00:04:42,448 --> 00:04:44,367
I'm such an idiot.

77
00:04:45,576 --> 00:04:49,706
I thought things would be different.
But clearly, nothing has changed.

78
00:05:01,592 --> 00:05:03,344
[Swift Wind] I'm telling you, I felt her.

79
00:05:03,428 --> 00:05:05,805
I did. She-Ra is back.

80
00:05:06,347 --> 00:05:07,432
Yeah.

81
00:05:08,474 --> 00:05:09,809
Oh, no, you don't.

82
00:05:14,397 --> 00:05:15,481
Yeah.

83
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:18,776
Weird winds today.

84
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:21,904
What do you think you're doing?
You're supposed to be on my team.

85
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:23,948
We're doing this to cheer her up.

86
00:05:25,742 --> 00:05:27,285
[whoops]

87
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:33,833
I am the undefeated champion of ice ball.

88
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:37,795
You know that doesn't count, right?

89
00:05:44,052 --> 00:05:45,470
Ready, kiddo?

90
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:47,138
"Kiddo"?

91
00:05:47,221 --> 00:05:50,933
I'm the ruler of my own kingdom,
got it, old man?

92
00:05:54,937 --> 00:05:57,940
Don't take it personally,
Frosta's been having a rough time lately.

93
00:05:58,024 --> 00:05:59,901
This invasion has her pretty freaked out.

94
00:06:00,234 --> 00:06:03,029
Do kids not like me?
How do I make kids like me?

95
00:06:03,112 --> 00:06:05,031
Will Glimmer not like me when she's home?

96
00:06:05,114 --> 00:06:09,535
Okay, see, now it looks like
you're taking it super personally.

97
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:15,333
I need your help. We got word
that the Horde was sighted near Elberon.

98
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:18,586
-We have to go check on them.
-Elberon needs help?

99
00:06:18,669 --> 00:06:19,504
Yes.

100
00:06:21,005 --> 00:06:22,924
I mean, boo for them.

101
00:06:23,174 --> 00:06:26,803
But they throw the best victory parties.
Dibs on this mission.

102
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:31,390
Parties? Maybe Frosta should come, too.
We could use some fun. Hey, Frosta.

103
00:06:37,313 --> 00:06:40,441
[groans] Catra is driving me crazy.

104
00:06:40,566 --> 00:06:43,486
I thought we actually stood a chance
at fixing things this time.

105
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:46,781
But after everything we've been through,
she's still a stubborn brat.

106
00:06:46,989 --> 00:06:49,492
This is Catra we're talking about.

107
00:06:49,742 --> 00:06:53,663
Did you think she was going to instantly
become a different person?

108
00:06:54,872 --> 00:06:55,957
No, I just--

109
00:06:57,041 --> 00:06:58,751
I thought she'd at least try.

110
00:06:59,043 --> 00:07:02,797
We all risked our lives to save her
and she can't say thank you?

111
00:07:03,047 --> 00:07:05,216
Can you believe that? [scoffs]

112
00:07:07,552 --> 00:07:09,387
I believe in Horde Prime.

113
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:13,724
-What's he doing here?
-He's helping me make dinner.

114
00:07:13,808 --> 00:07:17,395
True nourishment comes
from the favor of Horde Prime.

115
00:07:17,895 --> 00:07:20,273
Also from nutrient-rich amniotic fluid.

116
00:07:20,898 --> 00:07:23,734
Yeah, well, we're not eating that.

117
00:07:24,402 --> 00:07:25,945
I think these rations were Mara's.

118
00:07:26,404 --> 00:07:29,115
Does space food expire?
What does this one say?

119
00:07:30,533 --> 00:07:32,285
"Dehydrated protein slaw."

120
00:07:33,244 --> 00:07:34,120
Yum?

121
00:07:34,495 --> 00:07:36,372
<i>Guys? You'd better get in here.</i>

122
00:07:43,921 --> 00:07:44,881
What's going on?

123
00:07:44,964 --> 00:07:48,468
Sensors picked up Horde ships on our tail.
They're coming straight for us.

124
00:07:48,551 --> 00:07:51,345
It's gotta be a coincidence.
Prime can't track this ship.

125
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:53,723
Is there somewhere we can hide
until they're gone?

126
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:55,558
[shrieks] Look.

127
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:57,643
It's an asteroid field.

128
00:07:57,977 --> 00:08:00,438
It would be so fun--

129
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:02,648
I mean, a great hiding spot.

130
00:08:02,773 --> 00:08:04,901

Horde Prime may not be able
to track Darla,

-Once again, Catra is ruining our lives.
-Entrapta hasn't fixed the shields yet.

a game of ice ball?

171
00:11:01,827 --> 00:11:03,496
That should liven things up.

172
00:11:06,415 --> 00:11:08,084
My daughter's gonna hate me.

173
00:11:16,133 --> 00:11:17,343
[Netossa] Where have you been?

174
00:11:17,426 --> 00:11:20,513
You know I don't like
being alone at parties.

175
00:11:20,596 --> 00:11:22,848
Something really weird just happened.

176
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:25,017
I know. This whole place is weird.

177
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:28,187
We're going back. There might be
someone who actually needs help.

178
00:11:28,312 --> 00:11:31,565
I don't know what happened to these guys.
Their last party was great.

179
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:34,902
It's like they've been replaced
with totally different people.

180
00:11:37,905 --> 00:11:40,282
It's getting dark outside.

181
00:11:43,619 --> 00:11:45,830
You don't want to be out in the dark.

182
00:11:46,247 --> 00:11:48,666
We really should get back to camp.

183
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:51,669
But our guest of honor hasn't arrived.

184
00:11:52,211 --> 00:11:57,883
Stay, and join us
in the light of Horde Prime.

185
00:11:58,342 --> 00:11:59,802
[grunts]

186
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:11,772
What is she doing in here?
I told you, I want to be alone.

187
00:12:11,856 --> 00:12:14,024
Entrapta's going to remove your chip.

188
00:12:14,108 --> 00:12:16,902
You're going to let her operate on me?
She'll kill me.

189
00:12:16,986 --> 00:12:19,488
Me? Why would I wanna hurt you?

190
00:12:20,489 --> 00:12:23,325
Oh, you mean because
you sent me to Beast Island,

191
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:26,662
stole my work and used it to rip a hole
in the fabric of space and time.

192
00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:28,664
I get it. Hold still.

193
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:31,041
Stay away from me.

194
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:35,921
Catra, Horde Prime is tracking that chip.
He's coming for us, right now.

195
00:12:36,005 --> 00:12:39,008
So, grow up and let us remove it,
or we're all dead.

196
00:12:42,678 --> 00:12:43,679
We're doing this.

197
00:12:43,762 --> 00:12:46,974
If you think hiding from the people
you hurt will make you feel better,

198
00:12:47,057 --> 00:12:49,602
we'll drop you off
and you'll never have to see us again.

199
00:12:55,316 --> 00:12:56,984
You'll never have to see me again.

200
00:12:59,528 --> 00:13:00,362
Adora, wait.

201
00:13:04,867 --> 00:13:05,701
Please.

202
00:13:09,955 --> 00:13:10,789
Stay.

203
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:14,418
Come to Lord Prime's light

204
00:13:14,835 --> 00:13:16,879
and you will find peace.

205
00:13:34,438 --> 00:13:35,272
Wait.

206
00:13:35,356 --> 00:13:39,151
Stop treating me like a little kid.
You don't need to protect me.

207
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:41,862
I'm not protecting you,
I'm protecting them.

208
00:13:41,946 --> 00:13:45,991
Horde Prime's done something to them.
But they're innocent Etherians.

209
00:13:46,408 --> 00:13:47,535
We can't hurt them.

210
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:52,039
You're the strongest one here.
Use your power to defend the team.

211
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:57,503
To me.

212
00:14:14,103 --> 00:14:15,104
What's happening?

213
00:14:16,897 --> 00:14:19,525
Experiment number 982.

214
00:14:19,608 --> 00:14:21,860
Removal of embedded Horde chip.

215
00:14:21,944 --> 00:14:23,487
Let's begin.

216
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:30,077
[gasps] Wait. Not yet.

217
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:33,581
-Catra, we don't have time.
-I can help you, okay?

218
00:14:35,374 --> 00:14:36,750
When Horde Prime was...

219
00:14:37,626 --> 00:14:38,711
using me, I felt--

220
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:41,005
It's like--

221
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:44,967
It's like all his clones are connected
to some kind of hive mind

222
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:46,302
and I was part of it.

223
00:14:47,344 --> 00:14:49,847
-Those flashes you're getting?
-It's him.

224
00:14:51,015 --> 00:14:52,725
He's still in there. He can--

225
00:14:53,642 --> 00:14:54,476
He can see me.

226
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:59,231
But maybe I can see him, too.
I can find out what he's planning.

227
00:14:59,315 --> 00:15:01,609
No, you can't risk
letting him back into your head.

228
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:02,776
Adora,

229
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:04,320
you have to let me try.

230
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:07,573
Otherwise you're gonna do
something stupid and get yourself killed.

231
00:15:08,198 --> 00:15:09,033
Just...

232
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:12,494
Just stay with me while I do it, okay?

233
00:15:21,086 --> 00:15:22,004
I can feel him.

234
00:15:23,005 --> 00:15:23,839
<i>He's--</i>

235
00:15:24,715 --> 00:15:25,549
<i>He's angry.</i>

236
00:15:26,842 --> 00:15:28,093
[groans]

237
00:15:31,513 --> 00:15:32,514
He wants revenge.

238
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:35,351
He wants to make you hurt, he's...

239
00:15:36,226 --> 00:15:38,062
attacking Etheria.

240
00:15:38,729 --> 00:15:40,689
No. No, no, no, not attacking.

241
00:15:41,065 --> 00:15:44,193
Something new is happening.
There's so much noise.

242
00:15:45,861 --> 00:15:46,695
He's...

243
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:51,116
<i>He's chipping them.</i>
<i>He's going to chip them all.</i>

244
00:15:53,369 --> 00:15:55,371
Horde Prime is taking control of Etheria.

245
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:57,873
No. He can't.

246
00:15:57,998 --> 00:16:00,501
It's already happening.
You gotta stop him.

247
00:16:10,094 --> 00:16:11,387
I'm losing visuals.

248
00:16:13,305 --> 00:16:17,643
Where did that asteroid come from?
Glimmer. Get over there and be my eyes.

249
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:24,316
My children, why do you struggle?

250
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:29,780
I wish to bring peace to your planet,
yet you reject it.

251
00:16:30,447 --> 00:16:35,327
She-Ra, if you really are out there,
are you getting this?

252
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:38,998
Your She-Ra will not come to save you now.

253
00:16:43,627 --> 00:16:46,130
[Darla] <i>The hull has sustained</i>
<i>multiple fractures.</i>

254
00:16:46,213 --> 00:16:49,341
<i>We will be unable</i>
<i>to withstand another full-on strike.</i>

255
00:16:50,342 --> 00:16:51,427
Adora, please...

256
00:16:52,261 --> 00:16:53,095
I...

257
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:55,097
I want to go home.

258
00:16:57,725 --> 00:16:58,559
We will.

259
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,186
I'm getting us out of here.

260
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:13,615
Etheria needs us.

261
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:17,286
And I won't let him hurt anyone else.

262
00:17:18,203 --> 00:17:21,290
-Where are you going?
-To send Horde Prime a message.

263
00:17:24,126 --> 00:17:27,212
For the honor of Grayskull.

264
00:18:03,248 --> 00:18:04,708
[yells]

265
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:11,840
Welcome, my children.

266
00:18:12,382 --> 00:18:16,512
You will be reborn in Prime's image.

267
00:18:26,021 --> 00:18:29,942
-Whoa! Did you guys see that?
-We'll be impressed later. Let's go.

268
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:40,494
Chip appears to be fused
with the subject's nervous system,

269
00:18:40,577 --> 00:18:42,621
leeching energy in a parasitic exchange.

270
00:18:42,913 --> 00:18:45,541
Extraction is going
to be a delicate process.

271
00:18:46,667 --> 00:18:48,043
Careful, now.

272
00:18:49,044 --> 00:18:49,878
Sorry.

273
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:51,296
Just get it off.

274
00:19:01,056 --> 00:19:04,059
<i>Tell Horde Prime this is from me.</i>

275
00:19:08,689 --> 00:19:09,523
Veer left.

276
00:19:09,606 --> 00:19:10,691
Up, up.

277
00:19:13,026 --> 00:19:14,027
Wait, is that--?

278
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:59,448
-Yeah.
-What is going on out there?

279
00:20:18,008 --> 00:20:19,009
Almost.

280
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:22,930
Almost.

281
00:20:25,432 --> 00:20:28,018
I did it. With the chip removed
from its power source,

282
00:20:28,101 --> 00:20:29,770
it won't be able to signal anymore.

283
00:20:31,021 --> 00:20:33,315
Okay, gotta go check on Darla now.

284
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:34,983
Entrapta, wait.

285
00:20:38,946 --> 00:20:39,821
Thank you.

286
00:20:40,447 --> 00:20:42,199
And I'm sorry.

287
00:20:46,411 --> 00:20:47,246
I forgive you.

288
00:20:50,332 --> 00:20:52,584
Shields and autopilot are back online.

289
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:54,419
Darla just needs some time to reboot

290
00:20:54,503 --> 00:20:56,713
and then she'll be back
to full functionality.

291
00:20:58,006 --> 00:20:59,007
She-Ra.

292
00:20:59,216 --> 00:21:00,300
She's really back.

293
00:21:00,592 --> 00:21:01,802
Like, back for real.

294
00:21:02,219 --> 00:21:04,596
Good timing, too. We really need her.

295
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:08,684
-Brothers.
-Who wants dinner?

296
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,729
[Bow] Glimmer.

297
00:21:12,813 --> 00:21:15,023
-You made these?
-Wrong Hordak helped.

298
00:21:15,232 --> 00:21:18,527
Everyone, eat, eat.
I used to make these with my mom.

299
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:22,281
She wasn't that good a cook either,
so I figured it would be hard to mess up.

300
00:21:22,364 --> 00:21:25,242
-This is really good.
-Okay, hold up. Glimmer, this is amazing.

301
00:21:25,325 --> 00:21:28,745
-Wow, this is delicious.
-Dehydrated slaw? This is so good.

302
00:21:52,394 --> 00:21:54,438
How is it? It smells good, right?

303
00:21:54,521 --> 00:21:58,108
-Does this come in smaller sizes?
-It was coming right at us.

304
00:21:58,275 --> 00:22:00,777
Then Glimmer was like,
"Oh, no. Bow, stop."

305
00:22:00,861 --> 00:22:04,531
And then I was, like, "Okay, I'll stop."
And then I pulled up, then we missed it.

306
00:22:05,782 --> 00:22:07,701
[Spinnerella] We've gotta go back
for them.

307
00:22:07,784 --> 00:22:08,785
[Micah] We will.

308
00:22:08,869 --> 00:22:11,204
But first we need to figure out
what that was.

309
00:22:11,288 --> 00:22:13,332
-And how to stop it.
-She-Ra will know.

310
00:22:13,957 --> 00:22:17,753
She's coming home, I can feel it.
She's getting closer every day.

311
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:21,673
Sorry for calling you an old man.

312
00:22:21,757 --> 00:22:23,759
Glimmer's really lucky
to have you as a dad.

313
00:22:24,092 --> 00:22:25,427
Really? You think so?

314
00:22:25,719 --> 00:22:29,181
Yes, but you really
gotta stop trying so hard.

315
00:22:31,349 --> 00:22:32,934
We don't know who we can trust now.

316
00:22:33,018 --> 00:22:36,563
But as long as we all stick together,
we'll get through this.

317
00:22:41,359 --> 00:22:43,361
[closing theme playing]
