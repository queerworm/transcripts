1
00:00:21,563 --> 00:00:24,566
Okay, She-Ra, I know you're in there.

2
00:00:27,485 --> 00:00:29,738
-Oh, you almost had it.
-[gasps]

3
00:00:29,821 --> 00:00:31,614
Will you stop distracting me?!

4
00:00:31,906 --> 00:00:35,952
Sorry, but there was definitely
some glow-y action going on there.

5
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:39,789
Come on, Adora. You can't let
distractions keep you from transforming.

6
00:00:40,123 --> 00:00:41,291
[Catra] What's going on?

7
00:00:41,833 --> 00:00:43,793
Ooh! Are we messing with Adora? [grunts]

8
00:00:43,877 --> 00:00:45,628
Catra, do you have to sit right there?

9
00:00:45,712 --> 00:00:48,673
-What? I'm not doing anything.
-Adora, concentrate!

10
00:00:48,757 --> 00:00:50,800
Yeah, Adora, concentrate.

11
00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:51,718
You can do it.

12
00:00:51,801 --> 00:00:53,386
[Catra purring]

13
00:00:57,432 --> 00:00:58,475
[grunts]

14
00:01:03,772 --> 00:01:06,066
-[Entrapta] This way!
-[Adora groans]

15
00:01:06,149 --> 00:01:07,692
Oh, hi, Adora.

16
00:01:07,776 --> 00:01:08,651
Don't mind us.

17
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:11,946
-Entrapta, do you have to do that in here?
-Yes.

18
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:16,242
This is where the signal is strongest.
We're less than a day out from Etheria.

19
00:01:16,326 --> 00:01:19,329
We'll be in range to send a message
to the Rebellion soon.

20
00:01:20,371 --> 00:01:21,456
I can't believe...

21
00:01:22,248 --> 00:01:25,001
I'm a day away from meeting my dad.

22
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:28,588
It's been so long. I barely remember him.

23
00:01:35,011 --> 00:01:36,095
Ready to be home?

24
00:01:36,638 --> 00:01:37,680
Not really.

25
00:01:40,308 --> 00:01:42,685
Okay, fine. Maybe.

26
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:47,357
[Entrapta cackles]

27
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:49,692
What do you think's going on right now
on Etheria?

28
00:01:58,535 --> 00:02:02,997
Our friends have still not returned
from their perilous space mission.

29
00:02:03,081 --> 00:02:05,708
So, it's up to us to save Etheria.

30
00:02:06,417 --> 00:02:11,714
Onward, to a secret,
underwater party adventure.

31
00:02:12,715 --> 00:02:13,967
[Mermista groans]

32
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:16,636
<i>♪ We're on the edge of greatness ♪</i>

33
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:19,889

00:02:25,645 --> 00:02:28,064

41
00:02:45,081 --> 00:02:48,459
{\an8}[chuckles] Okay, so, it's not
that I didn't understand the plan,

42
00:02:48,543 --> 00:02:52,547
{\an8}but I didn't understand the plan.
Why are we dressed like this?

43
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:57,552
{\an8}Because it's a secret undercover mission
to find Prince Peekablue.

44
00:02:57,635 --> 00:02:59,387
{\an8}The reclusive Peekablue is a hermit.

45
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:03,808
{\an8}But he was spotted at the top-secret
Enchanted Grotto's underwater soiree.

46
00:03:03,892 --> 00:03:07,312
A gathering place
for all well-heeled criminals of Etheria.

47
00:03:07,395 --> 00:03:12,066
{\an8}Hmph! So, he'll show up to a criminal
enterprise, but won't so much as RSVP

48
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:15,194
{\an8}to my drum circle
so I know how many drums to have?

49
00:03:15,278 --> 00:03:16,863
{\an8}All right, yeah, I got it.

50
00:03:16,946 --> 00:03:19,365
{\an8}And, uh, why do we need him?

51
00:03:19,657 --> 00:03:22,577
Because Peekablue has
the power of Farsight.

52
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:24,913
He can magically see to the edges
of the universe.

53
00:03:24,996 --> 00:03:28,082
If we recruit him, he can tell us
where Adora and the others are.

54
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:31,586
We have to warn them
that Prime is chipping people on Etheria

55
00:03:31,669 --> 00:03:33,338
and get them back ASAP.

56
00:03:33,421 --> 00:03:35,548
No one at the soiree can know we're there.

57
00:03:35,632 --> 00:03:38,676
So, I've assigned everyone
undercover aliases.

58
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:41,804
-[gasps]
-Scorpia, you're Lynda D'Ream,

59
00:03:41,888 --> 00:03:44,766
a farmer and mother
to five little scorpions.

60
00:03:44,849 --> 00:03:46,601
[chuckles] "Lynda D'Ream"?

61
00:03:46,684 --> 00:03:49,646
I don't know if you've noticed,
but I'm not exactly great at lying

62
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:53,733
or pretending or blending in.
I mean, I'm just the muscle.

63
00:03:53,816 --> 00:03:55,777
-Not a spy.
-Nonsense, Lynda.

64
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:57,654
You were born for this role.

65
00:03:57,737 --> 00:04:00,448
Perfuma, you're Tara, a blacksmith.

66
00:04:00,823 --> 00:04:01,908
Ooh! I love it.

67
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:05,870
What if Tara has an unmatched skill
at cards and wears an eye patch

68
00:04:05,954 --> 00:04:08,498
and has a dark, checkered past
and an evil twin?

69
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:10,750
Ooh! I can play the evil twin.

70
00:04:11,042 --> 00:04:12,293
Keep it simple, Tara.

71
00:04:12,377 --> 00:04:13,253
[Perfuma giggles]

72
00:04:13,336 --> 00:04:16,130
[Mermista] Okay, the sooner we find
the prince, the sooner we figure out

73
00:04:16,214 --> 00:04:17,548
where our friends are.

74
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:27,100
[Spinnerella] There you are.

75
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:28,768
Hey, you.

76
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:31,271
Any chance I could steal you away
for a moment?

77
00:04:31,354 --> 00:04:32,522
[sighs] Not now, darling.

78
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:34,232
After what happened at Elberon,

79
00:04:34,315 --> 00:04:36,859
we need to focus on the next move
for the Rebellion.

80
00:04:37,235 --> 00:04:39,237
Please? It'd only take a second.

81
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:41,197
I don't have the time.

82
00:04:41,906 --> 00:04:44,492
Oh, yeah, sure. I understand.

83
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:52,542
Is it me, or is she... mad at me?

84
00:04:54,168 --> 00:04:56,838
I don't know.
It honestly doesn't seem like

85
00:04:56,921 --> 00:04:58,381
she's feeling much of anything.

86
00:04:58,464 --> 00:05:00,216
[gasps] It's our anniversary!

87
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:01,968
And I completely forgot.

88
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:04,387
Oh, I gotta fix this, Swifty.

89
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:06,472
[indistinct chatter]

90
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:15,189
The dolphins roll in the tide at dawn.

91
00:05:15,273 --> 00:05:16,441
[roars]

92
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:19,986
Secret, underwater party adventure!

93
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:29,537
Why are we in a broom closet?

94
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:31,205
Yeah, where's the soiree?

95
00:05:31,289 --> 00:05:33,207
Oh, this isn't the soiree.

96
00:05:38,129 --> 00:05:41,424
-This is the soiree.
-[Perfuma giggles]

97
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:54,437
This place is swimming
with bounty hunters, pirates and sirens

98
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:57,273
who would sell us out in a beat
of their cold-blooded hearts.

99
00:05:57,356 --> 00:06:01,235
We need to blend in,
and find the prince quickly and quietly.

100
00:06:01,569 --> 00:06:03,404
Do not ruin this for me.

101
00:06:03,821 --> 00:06:04,697
[chuckles]

102
00:06:04,781 --> 00:06:06,240
You don't have to tell me twice.

103
00:06:06,324 --> 00:06:07,909
These are my people.

104
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:10,661
I just have to work the room and--
[whimpers]

105
00:06:10,745 --> 00:06:12,205
Ugh! What is it?

106
00:06:12,288 --> 00:06:13,915
Oh, no, nothing, nothing, nothing.

107
00:06:13,998 --> 00:06:16,292
I just didn't know, uh, he'd be here.

108
00:06:18,294 --> 00:06:20,880
I thought these were your "people."

109
00:06:20,963 --> 00:06:23,299
They are my people.
Which means that most of them

110
00:06:23,382 --> 00:06:25,718
have sworn revenge against me
at some point.

111
00:06:28,805 --> 00:06:30,056
[grumbles]

112
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:34,393
Quick! Let's, uh, go mingle.

113
00:06:34,477 --> 00:06:36,020
[stammers] Over there.

114
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:41,526
Okay, it's game time.
Tara's gonna go chat up those fellas.

115
00:06:41,609 --> 00:06:44,112
You go mingle with those ruffians there.

116
00:06:44,445 --> 00:06:46,197
Good luck, Lynda D'Ream.

117
00:06:47,156 --> 00:06:48,616
Oh, gosh.

118
00:06:48,991 --> 00:06:52,078
What a lovely shindig, huh? [chuckles]

119
00:06:52,161 --> 00:06:55,456
My word, that sword is very pointy.

120
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:57,208
-[blow lands]
-[grunts]

121
00:06:57,291 --> 00:07:00,586
I really hope this doesn't get in the way
of rekindling...

122
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:05,258
I... [stammers] Wrong word.
Uh, relighting our friendship.

123
00:07:05,341 --> 00:07:09,971
Nope, that's-- That's bad, too.
Look, I'm sorry I set your boat on fire.

124
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:11,806
-Do you forgive me?
-[muffled grunting]

125
00:07:11,889 --> 00:07:14,100
Excellent, I'll take that as a "yes."

126
00:07:14,183 --> 00:07:15,393
Sea Hawk, focus.

127
00:07:15,476 --> 00:07:19,313
This cannot be like the time you ruined
the Cephalopods Literary Society.

128
00:07:19,397 --> 00:07:21,023
Aw, don't worry.

129
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:25,611
Now that he can't blow my cover,
it's smooth sailing from here. [exclaims]

130
00:07:27,697 --> 00:07:29,532
[roars]

131
00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:34,954
[all laughing]

132
00:07:35,037 --> 00:07:36,747
Yeah. Totally.

133
00:07:36,831 --> 00:07:40,209
[sighs] So, underwater, huh?

134
00:07:40,751 --> 00:07:43,463
Things? Yeah, yeah, yeah...

135
00:07:44,505 --> 00:07:47,300
Peekablue? Anybody? No? Nobody?

136
00:07:47,383 --> 00:07:48,759
Okay. Well, uh...

137
00:07:48,843 --> 00:07:50,720
never mind. Well, good night.

138
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:55,975
And that's when I told him,
I don't even know how to swim.

139
00:07:56,058 --> 00:07:57,894
[all laughing]

140
00:08:05,276 --> 00:08:09,363
Please tell me that's the last
of your disgruntled former cohorts.

141
00:08:09,447 --> 00:08:10,948
[chuckles nervously]

142
00:08:11,657 --> 00:08:14,452
Uh, perhaps we should just stay back here?

143
00:08:15,411 --> 00:08:16,412
[gasps]

144
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:22,835
[groans]

145
00:08:23,711 --> 00:08:26,130
-[Mermista grunting]
-[crashing noises]

146
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:31,594
How did it go? Did you find out anything?

147
00:08:31,677 --> 00:08:34,722
Yeah. I found out I'm really bad at this.

148
00:08:34,805 --> 00:08:35,681
[sighs]

149
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:37,266
Don't say that.

150
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:39,894
That-- That's just the old you talking,

151
00:08:39,977 --> 00:08:43,523
consumed with all that self-doubt
the Horde instilled in you.

152
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:46,776
I'm just--
I'm not really the leading-lady type.

153
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:49,612
That's nonsense.

154
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:53,282
You're amazing. You have the biggest heart
and you could do

155
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:55,159
whatever you put your mind to.

156
00:08:55,743 --> 00:09:00,164
-Really?
-Okay. What do you, Scorpia, like to do?

157
00:09:00,581 --> 00:09:02,583
Well, I always liked singing.

158
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,713
But I'm bad. Everyone said so.
Well, Catra said so, but it's fine.

159
00:09:07,797 --> 00:09:10,967
Scorpia, you should do things
not because you're good at them

160
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:12,969
but because they make you happy.

161
00:09:13,928 --> 00:09:14,929
Follow me, okay?

162
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:17,348
Repeat after me:

163
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:18,849
I can do this.

164
00:09:19,183 --> 00:09:20,434
I can do this.

165
00:09:20,935 --> 00:09:22,270
Perfuma can do this.

166
00:09:22,603 --> 00:09:25,523
-Perfuma can--
-No, no, no. You can do this. Heh.

167
00:09:25,606 --> 00:09:26,566
Say "I."

168
00:09:26,941 --> 00:09:29,193
I-- I can do this?

169
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:31,362
I can do this.

170
00:09:31,612 --> 00:09:32,822
I can do this.

171
00:09:33,531 --> 00:09:35,408
I can find Prince Peekablue!

172

[both yelling]

347
00:20:15,172 --> 00:20:16,673
Perfuma, go!

348
00:20:27,184 --> 00:20:30,145
-Scorpia, come on!
-[Scorpia] There's too many of them.

349
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:32,814
And this place is coming down
unless someone stops it.

350
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:37,236
You have to get out
and protect the others.

351
00:20:41,031 --> 00:20:42,157
Go. Now!

352
00:20:42,491 --> 00:20:43,742
What? No!

353
00:20:44,868 --> 00:20:46,286
You're coming, too!

354
00:20:47,162 --> 00:20:49,456
[Scorpia] Nah. This is why I'm here.

355
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:51,792
I'm the muscle, remember?

356
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:54,294
I can do this.

357
00:21:05,806 --> 00:21:08,100
[screaming]

358
00:21:23,198 --> 00:21:25,200
[Netossa grunting]

359
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:35,377
I'm sorry!

360
00:21:41,216 --> 00:21:42,426
Run, quick!

361
00:21:44,219 --> 00:21:45,721
[Swifty whinnies]

362
00:21:52,644 --> 00:21:53,854
Happy anniversary.

363

[chiming]

364
00:22:00,694 --> 00:22:02,696
Ha! A signal.

365
00:22:03,113 --> 00:22:07,451
We're in range. Patching us through
to the Rebellion's communication line.

366
00:22:09,369 --> 00:22:11,204
-<i>Adora?</i>
-Perfuma.

367
00:22:11,288 --> 00:22:12,247
What's going on?

368
00:22:12,914 --> 00:22:14,624
<i>I... I...</i>

369
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:17,210
We're on our way back.
Just hang on a little longer.

370
00:22:17,294 --> 00:22:19,713
-We're almost there.
-<i>No! Don't come back.</i>

371
00:22:19,796 --> 00:22:23,008
<i>Horde Prime knows you're coming.</i>
<i>There's a trap, a blockade.</i>

372
00:22:23,091 --> 00:22:25,677
<i>You'll never make it through.</i>
<i>You need to stay away.</i>

373
00:22:26,136 --> 00:22:28,180
<i>The Rebellion's been compromised.</i>

374
00:22:28,263 --> 00:22:29,765
<i>Horde Prime has them.</i>

375
00:22:30,307 --> 00:22:33,477
<i>We lost. I'm so sorry, we lost them.</i>
