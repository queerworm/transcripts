{\an8}Adora, I'm trying, but no one's answering.

00:00:28,653 --> 00:00:32,741
{\an8}Uh-oh. I think I found the blockade
Perfuma was talking about.

6
00:00:33,241 --> 00:00:34,909
{\an8}That's a lot of Horde ships.

7
00:00:34,993 --> 00:00:36,911
{\an8}How are we going to get through that?

8
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,497
{\an8}If I could use magic,
I'd teleport us past it.

9
00:00:39,581 --> 00:00:43,126
{\an8}I've never felt such a lack
of magical energy in my life.

10
00:00:43,418 --> 00:00:45,462
Why does space hate me so much?!

11
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:47,172
{\an8}Our friends need us.

12
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:49,507
{\an8}Magic or no magic, we're going home.

13
00:00:49,591 --> 00:00:52,469
So, your plan is to, what?
Ram through an armada of ships?

14
00:00:52,927 --> 00:00:53,970
No!

15
00:00:54,637 --> 00:00:56,556
Maybe! We have to try.

16
00:00:56,639 --> 00:00:58,850
You heard Perfuma. They're waiting for us.

17
00:00:58,933 --> 00:01:01,853
They're going to catch us.
And if they do...

18
00:01:04,939 --> 00:01:07,650
Take it from someone
who's defeated you guys, like, a lot.

19
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:12,363
-Charging in without a plan won't work.
-Okay, well, heh, you didn't defeat us.

20
00:01:12,447 --> 00:01:13,782
Adora, Catra's right.

21
00:01:14,532 --> 00:01:15,909
That felt weird to say.

22
00:01:15,992 --> 00:01:18,703
We barely made it out last time
we tangled with Prime.

23
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:21,748
We need to figure out another way
to help our friends.

24
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:23,583
Catra, you were with him.

25
00:01:23,708 --> 00:01:26,544
Does he have any kind of,
I don't know, weakness?

26
00:01:26,628 --> 00:01:28,046
What, you think he'd tell me?

27
00:01:28,129 --> 00:01:30,715
-[Wrong Hordak] You are correct, brother.
-[all scream]

28

We do not discuss Horde Prime's weakness.

Uh, heh,

30
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:38,723
so, that means
Horde Prime does have a weakness.

31
00:01:39,808 --> 00:01:42,811
No. Horde Prime is all-powerful.

-You just said--
-We do not discuss Horde Prime's weakness.

We do not discuss Krytis.

34
00:01:48,817 --> 00:01:49,651
What's Krytis?

35
00:01:49,734 --> 00:01:53,488
[Wrong Hordak] Krytis does not exist.
And if it did, we would not discuss it.

43
00:02:10,588 --> 00:02:14,634
A-ha! According to Darla's records,
it's located here. Not too far from us.

45
00:02:16,427 --> 00:02:18,847
It is located nowhere,

-because Lord Prime destroyed it.
-I know what I saw.

47
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:24,894
Prime's trying to hide something,
and it has to do with this planet.

48
00:02:25,353 --> 00:02:28,690
[Adora] There's something on Krytis
Prime doesn't want us to know about.

49
00:02:29,274 --> 00:02:30,733
And we're gonna find it.

We'll guide you through from here.

[Catra] So, wait.

87
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:14,897
The plan is to barge ahead
into the structurally unsound building

to find some mystery person
that we know nothing about,

89
00:05:17,525 --> 00:05:20,903
in hopes that they somehow know
how to defeat Horde Prime?

-That about sums it up.
-Yep, that's the plan. [giggles]

What--? What do you think you're doing?

103
00:06:19,462 --> 00:06:23,382
I don't understand how this happened.
Surely this can't be everyone who's left?

We-- We need to find another place
to make camp.

They know we're here.
They could be back at any time.

106
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:31,974
So, that's it? We're going to hide?

107
00:06:32,266 --> 00:06:34,435
Just until we figure out what to do.

108
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:38,231
Maybe we could go to Mystacor.
It has that invisibility spell.

109

[Shadow Weaver] That's not going to work.

With Micah controlled by Prime,
Mystacor is already compromised.

How did the Rebellion lose so many
of our finest members

112
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:53,329
and yet we're still stuck with you?

113
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:55,123
We're wasting time here.

114
00:06:55,289 --> 00:06:58,417
We need to seek out the Horde
and get my brother back.

115
00:06:58,501 --> 00:07:01,462
I lost him once.
I'm not gonna lose him again.

116

Oh, we need to get out of here.

117
00:07:03,381 --> 00:07:06,300
We need to make sure
the rest of the Rebellion is safe first.

If you want to help Micah, come with me.

I would ever go anywhere with you.

00:10:30,838 --> 00:10:32,423
I am not cute.

171
00:10:32,673 --> 00:10:35,301
The angrier you get, the cuter you are.

172
00:10:35,801 --> 00:10:36,761
[growls]

173
00:10:38,054 --> 00:10:39,930
-[screams]
-Catra!

174
00:10:40,348 --> 00:10:41,849
Get me out of this thing.

175
00:10:44,685 --> 00:10:45,853
[all scream]

176
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:46,854
Bow!

177
00:10:47,438 --> 00:10:50,483
I think the feeling I had about this place
is a bad feeling.

178
00:11:04,955 --> 00:11:08,459
Don't look at me like that.
You could slow down, you know.

179
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:12,380
-Where are we going?
-There's no time. You need to keep up.

180
00:11:12,713 --> 00:11:14,173
You said you had a plan.

181
00:11:14,382 --> 00:11:16,050
The only reason I'm following you

182
00:11:16,133 --> 00:11:19,678
is because if anyone would know
about mind control, it's you.

183
00:11:20,888 --> 00:11:21,722
[chuckles]

184
00:11:21,806 --> 00:11:24,683
Mind control? Is that what they told you?

185
00:11:25,142 --> 00:11:28,896
No, my gifts were always far subtler.

186
00:11:28,979 --> 00:11:31,524
Then you're wasting my time.
I'm going back.

187
00:11:31,607 --> 00:11:35,319
You never held a candle to Micah's power
as a sorcerer.

188
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:36,737
Neither did I.

189
00:11:37,238 --> 00:11:41,867
We both know how dangerous he is now
that his magic is controlled by the enemy.

190
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:43,869
We won't be able to stop him.

191
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:48,332
He could do irreparable damage to others,
and to himself.

192
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:52,378
So, what is your plan?

193
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:55,381
[Shadow Weaver]
We make ourselves stronger.

194
00:12:01,512 --> 00:12:04,223
What was that?
Why did that wall try to eat me?

195
00:12:08,686 --> 00:12:11,772
-Isn't this where we started?
-[growling in distance]

196
00:12:14,859 --> 00:12:16,694
You guys hear that, too, right?

197
00:12:16,777 --> 00:12:19,905
[Entrapta]
<i>The energy signature is just ahead of you.</i>

198
00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:21,949
<i>Go through the door on your left.</i>

199
00:12:22,032 --> 00:12:23,951
Door? What--? What door?

200
00:12:29,457 --> 00:12:32,042
We're not really going through that,
are we?

201
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:35,671
Well, Entrapta says this is the way,
so, let's go.

202
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:40,259
Seriously?
How have you guys stayed alive this long?

203
00:12:52,855 --> 00:12:54,773
[Entrapta] <i>Adora, are you there?</i>

204
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:56,942
<i>Wrong Hordak downloaded</i>
<i>the rest of the records</i>

205
00:12:57,026 --> 00:12:59,570
from Prime's occupation of Krytis,
and guess what.

206
00:12:59,778 --> 00:13:02,990
This planet was once a First One's colony
like Etheria.

207
00:13:03,073 --> 00:13:05,159
It looks like Horde Prime
and the First Ones

208
00:13:05,242 --> 00:13:08,162
were fighting for control of this planet,
and Horde Prime won.

209
00:13:08,245 --> 00:13:11,373
But something on the planet drove him away
before he could conquer it.

210
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:13,626
He tried to erase all records
of his failure.

211
00:13:13,709 --> 00:13:16,837
Horde Prime lied to us.

212
00:13:16,921 --> 00:13:19,590
He is not all-powerful.

213
00:13:19,882 --> 00:13:21,592
See? We're on the right path.

214
00:13:21,842 --> 00:13:23,677
But we have to get out of here first.

215
00:13:23,761 --> 00:13:26,388
And that door
still isn't getting any closer.

216
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:29,391
-[Entrapta] <i>Sorry, what door?</i>
-What do you mean "what door?"

217
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:32,603
-The one you told us to go through.
-[Entrapta] <i>That wasn't me.</i>

218
00:13:32,686 --> 00:13:35,231
<i>This is the first time we've talked</i>
<i>since the last floor.</i>

219
00:13:41,237 --> 00:13:43,948
I knew it!
I knew this was a terrible plan.

220
00:13:44,031 --> 00:13:47,201
This place is weird and unnatural.
We need to get out of here before--

221
00:13:47,284 --> 00:13:49,620
[Entrapta]
<i>By the way, who's your new friend?</i>

222
00:13:50,454 --> 00:13:52,164
What are you talking about?

223
00:13:52,248 --> 00:13:54,250
-It's just the four of us.
-Hate to disagree,

224
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:58,337
but there's a definite heat signature
right behind you.

225
00:14:03,717 --> 00:14:04,718
[all scream]

226
00:14:06,428 --> 00:14:07,429
[Catra screams]

227
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:09,974
[Catra screams]

228
00:14:10,933 --> 00:14:12,268
[Adora] <i>Catra! Catra!</i>

229
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:14,228
Adora, I'm down here.

230
00:14:20,943 --> 00:14:21,777
[roars]

231
00:14:22,069 --> 00:14:24,029
-[Adora] <i>I'm coming.</i>
-Hurry.

232
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:31,370
[yells]

233
00:14:32,454 --> 00:14:34,707
Adora, what do we do?

234
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:37,376
I don't know. Just-- Just nobody move.

235
00:14:41,338 --> 00:14:45,175
-Glimmer, what are you doing?
-Hang on. I have to try something.

236
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:50,222
Illusions. These are all illusions.

237
00:14:51,932 --> 00:14:53,183
Then that means...

238
00:15:00,316 --> 00:15:03,110
I knew I was feeling something
about this place.

239
00:15:03,193 --> 00:15:05,446
I thought it was bad, but it's not.

240
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:07,114
It's magic.

241
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:09,950
-[creature roaring in distance]
-Catra.

242
00:15:11,368 --> 00:15:13,370
[growling]

243
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:24,590
[growling]

244
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:28,636
Ah... ah... [sneezes]

245
00:15:36,477 --> 00:15:37,603
[sneezes]

246
00:15:38,687 --> 00:15:39,730
[purrs]

247
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:43,317
[all yelling]

248
00:15:45,819 --> 00:15:47,529
Catra, hold... on?

249
00:15:47,905 --> 00:15:48,906
[purring]

250
00:15:52,326 --> 00:15:55,704
Are you-- Are you petting the thing
that's been trying to kill us?

251
00:15:56,121 --> 00:15:59,083
I'm trying something here,
if you didn't notice.

252
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:02,252
It's just so cute.

253
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:03,754
It's not cute!

254
00:16:03,837 --> 00:16:05,714
-[creature growling]
-[yelps]

255
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:08,509
-Get away from her.
-No. Don't.

256
00:16:09,259 --> 00:16:12,388
I'm sorry. I got angry.
It's something I'm working on.

257
00:16:12,846 --> 00:16:14,473
Ohh. You are?

258
00:16:14,556 --> 00:16:16,350
Yes. Now can you please--?

259
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:22,523
Yes, I am.
I think this thing responds to emotions.

260
00:16:22,606 --> 00:16:25,275
So, can you not give me a hard time
right now?

261
00:16:25,359 --> 00:16:27,569
No. Sorry, sorry. Do-- Do your thing.

262
00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:30,155
[growling]

263
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:31,073
It's okay.

264
00:16:32,199 --> 00:16:33,617
We won't hurt you.

265
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:47,214
[sneezes]

266
00:16:50,092 --> 00:16:50,968
[sneezes]

267
00:16:52,136 --> 00:16:53,095
[growling]

268
00:16:53,721 --> 00:16:55,764
You're-- You're magic, aren't you?

269
00:16:57,725 --> 00:16:59,935
-[hisses]
-Me, too.

270
00:17:09,486 --> 00:17:10,612
[Adora chuckles]

271
00:17:11,321 --> 00:17:12,197
[mewling]

272
00:17:12,781 --> 00:17:14,491
Uh, what's it doing?

273
00:17:16,076 --> 00:17:16,910
Uh, guys?

274
00:17:17,786 --> 00:17:20,998
Can you hear it talking, too?
Please tell me you can hear it talking.

275
00:17:21,081 --> 00:17:23,167
-[continues mewling]
-Uh...

276
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:25,294
It must have imprinted on you.

277
00:17:25,753 --> 00:17:27,504
It... trusts you.

278
00:17:27,588 --> 00:17:30,924
Well, it shouldn't.
Why is everything with you guys so weird?

279
00:17:31,008 --> 00:17:32,676
[mewling]

280
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:35,679
It says its name is Melog.

281
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:37,723
It's been here...

282
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,225
by itself for a long time.

283
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:45,939
It thought we were enemies like, um, like
the ones that came to take its magic?

284
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:48,942
They dug into the ground, built machines.

285
00:17:49,026 --> 00:17:51,737
The First Ones.
That's what they were doing.

286
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:55,282
They were mining this planet's magic,
just like on Etheria.

287
00:17:55,657 --> 00:17:56,575
[mewling]

288
00:17:56,658 --> 00:17:58,077
[Catra] But they took too much.

289
00:17:59,119 --> 00:17:59,953
And then...

290
00:18:01,246 --> 00:18:02,998
"the one who destroys" came.

291
00:18:07,127 --> 00:18:08,003
[gasps]

292
00:18:08,796 --> 00:18:11,590
He tried to conquer this place
but couldn't.

293
00:18:11,965 --> 00:18:14,635
The magic of Krytis
was too wild for Prime.

294
00:18:14,718 --> 00:18:16,678
He didn't understand what it was.

295
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:19,014
He couldn't use it,
couldn't defend against it.

296
00:18:19,556 --> 00:18:21,934
Magic is Horde Prime's weakness.

297
00:18:23,393 --> 00:18:26,563
Melog drove Prime off
but couldn't defeat him.

298
00:18:26,855 --> 00:18:29,733
And now it's the last of its kind.

299
00:18:32,236 --> 00:18:33,862
I'm sorry for what happened to you,

300
00:18:34,071 --> 00:18:36,907
but we're gonna make sure
it never happens again.

301
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:39,243
Our planet has magic, too.

302
00:18:39,326 --> 00:18:42,412
It might be the last place in the universe
that does.

303
00:18:42,496 --> 00:18:46,125
If you wanna come with us,
I think you'd really like it there.

304
00:18:50,087 --> 00:18:53,924
Entrapta? We're on our way back down.
And we're bringing a friend.

305
00:18:54,007 --> 00:18:56,218
That's great. And I'm happy to report

306
00:18:56,301 --> 00:18:59,304
that Wrong Hordak's existential crisis
has resolved.

307
00:18:59,388 --> 00:19:01,890
Brothers, Horde Prime lied to us.

308
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:03,183
He is a false ruler.

309
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:06,478
We must rise up against him
and free the universe

310
00:19:06,562 --> 00:19:08,522
<i>from his unjust reign.</i>

311
00:19:08,605 --> 00:19:10,691
-That's the plan.
-[Bow] Uh, Adora?

312
00:19:11,066 --> 00:19:13,735
We still don't know
how we're gonna get back to Etheria.

313
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:15,571
Hmm. About that,

314
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:17,865
I think I might have an idea.

315
00:19:22,911 --> 00:19:25,247
I can't believe I fell for this.

316
00:19:25,622 --> 00:19:27,249
You don't care about Micah.

317
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:31,003
All you've ever cared about
is getting more power for yourself.

318
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:33,505
Well, I'm putting a stop to this
right now.

319
00:19:33,589 --> 00:19:35,591
[snoring softly]

320
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:45,601
Everything we were taught
in the Sorcerers' Guild was wrong.

321
00:19:46,226 --> 00:19:49,605
The First Ones didn't enhance
this planet's magic with their tech,

322
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:50,772
they weakened it.

323
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:52,900
Etheria isn't a weapon.

324
00:19:53,442 --> 00:19:58,906
It's a living creature, and its magic
has been here the whole time, slumbering,

325
00:19:58,989 --> 00:20:00,782
waiting to be awakened.

326
00:20:01,617 --> 00:20:04,077
Prime has taken our strongest fighters,

327
00:20:04,161 --> 00:20:08,832
but he does not yet know
what this planet really is.

328
00:20:09,249 --> 00:20:12,544
We can destroy the restraints
the First Ones built,

329
00:20:12,753 --> 00:20:18,217
set the magic of Etheria free
and use it against him.

330
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:19,718
[Castaspella scoffs]

331
00:20:21,178 --> 00:20:23,805
You just want to take the magic
for yourself.

332
00:20:24,139 --> 00:20:26,600
[Shadow Weaver] I want to save Micah.

333
00:20:26,808 --> 00:20:28,685
I owe him that much, at least.

334
00:20:29,478 --> 00:20:30,520
Come with me.

335
00:20:30,854 --> 00:20:34,775
Help me undo
what the First Ones did and...

336
00:20:35,651 --> 00:20:39,571
stop me if I try
to take the power for myself.

337
00:20:42,616 --> 00:20:44,743
You better believe I will.

338
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:55,504
Coming up on the blockade around Etheria.
They'll have visual on us soon.

339
00:20:55,837 --> 00:20:57,839
We sure this is gonna work?

340
00:20:57,923 --> 00:20:59,424
Only one way to find out.

341
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:00,926
Ready?

342
00:21:21,488 --> 00:21:22,322
Hmm.

343
00:21:22,656 --> 00:21:27,703
So, just to make sure I get it,
we're running through a Horde blockade

344
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:30,163
while relying on the magic
of a creature we just met?

345
00:21:30,956 --> 00:21:32,249
That about sums it up, yes.

346
00:21:34,334 --> 00:21:35,585
Punch it, Darla!

347
00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:41,466
[all screaming]

348
00:22:00,485 --> 00:22:01,486
[gasps]

349
00:22:06,408 --> 00:22:07,326
[grunts]

350
00:22:07,951 --> 00:22:09,328
It worked.

351
00:22:10,037 --> 00:22:11,413
It worked. Ah!

352
00:22:11,955 --> 00:22:12,831
Melog did it!

353
00:22:12,914 --> 00:22:14,166
[all cheer]

354
00:22:15,876 --> 00:22:16,752
[mewls]

355
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:19,588
-Mwah!
-[growls]

356
00:22:19,671 --> 00:22:21,340
Catra saved the day.

357
00:22:21,423 --> 00:22:26,428
-Aw, come here. Best Friend Squad hug.
-[grunts] No. No. Absolutely not.

358
00:22:30,098 --> 00:22:32,100
[door opening]

359
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:39,024
We made it.

360
00:22:39,858 --> 00:22:40,734
We're home.
