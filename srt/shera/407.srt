1
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:42,042
I called you here
to discuss what happened today.

2
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:45,628
The mission to retake Dryl
was a complete disaster.

3
00:00:46,171 --> 00:00:47,839
We barely made it out.

4
00:00:47,922 --> 00:00:48,923
I wanna know why.

5
00:00:49,507 --> 00:00:52,302
The Horde knew we were coming.
They were ready.

6
00:00:52,385 --> 00:00:53,762
How do they keep doing this?

7
00:00:53,845 --> 00:00:57,056
We thought they were tracking Adora,
but she wasn't even there today.

8
00:00:57,140 --> 00:01:01,895
Isn't it obvious? There's a Horde spy
somewhere in Bright Moon.

9
00:01:08,109 --> 00:01:12,238
And no one is going anywhere
until we figure out who it is.

00:01:14,783 --> 00:01:17,535

20
00:01:47,816 --> 00:01:50,652
Mermista, it's very unlikely
that there's a spy--

21
00:01:50,735 --> 00:01:52,237
We need to investigate.

22
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,030
I'll be the lead detective

23
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:57,033
since I've read
every single <i>Mer-Mystery</i> book.

24
00:01:57,117 --> 00:01:58,284
Mer-what?

25
00:01:58,368 --> 00:02:01,454
<i>Mer-Mystery.</i> It's only the best
undersea mystery novel series ever.

26
00:02:01,538 --> 00:02:05,333
There's 18 of them. It taught me
everything about solving mysteries.

27
00:02:05,917 --> 00:02:07,669
Murder mysteries.

28
00:02:07,752 --> 00:02:08,753
[Sea Hawk grunts]

29
00:02:08,837 --> 00:02:11,673
Um... But no one's been murdered.

30
00:02:11,756 --> 00:02:12,715
-Yet.
-[shouts]

31
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:15,176
First, we need to question the suspects.

32
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:16,553
Who are the suspects?

33
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:19,264
Everyone is a suspect.

34
00:02:20,223 --> 00:02:23,017
Everyone? Is anyone else sweating?

35
00:02:23,101 --> 00:02:24,018
I'm sweating.

36
00:02:24,394 --> 00:02:26,104
This is a waste of time.

37
00:02:26,187 --> 00:02:29,774
We know that the Horde is pulling
their troops back for something big.

38
00:02:29,858 --> 00:02:33,611
-That's what we should be investigating.
-[Adora] No, Mermista's right.

39
00:02:34,195 --> 00:02:36,030
And it can't be me the Horde's tracking

40
00:02:36,114 --> 00:02:39,242
since, once again, you used me
as a distraction today.

41
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:42,620
A spy is really the only thing
that makes sense.

42
00:02:42,704 --> 00:02:45,957
Maybe they didn't fall for the distraction
because you're a bad actress.

43
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,792
And who would the spy even be, anyway?

44
00:02:47,876 --> 00:02:50,962
Heh. How about the Horde officer
who's living at--

45
00:02:51,045 --> 00:02:54,382
I'm sorry, being held prisoner
at Bright Moon?

46
00:02:54,465 --> 00:02:57,635
Shadow Weaver has actual shadow spies.
We met them.

47
00:02:57,719 --> 00:03:00,555
[Mermista] Shadow Weaver does seem
like the obvious suspect.

48
00:03:00,638 --> 00:03:03,057
Which means it definitely isn't her.

49
00:03:06,644 --> 00:03:07,979
It's never the obvious one.

50
00:03:08,062 --> 00:03:10,690
Like in <i>Mer-Mystery:</i>
<i>The Pearl Who Knew Too Much.</i>

51
00:03:10,773 --> 00:03:13,234
You think it's the pearl, but it's not.

52
00:03:13,943 --> 00:03:15,111
Spoilers.

53
00:03:16,487 --> 00:03:18,656
It's time to interrogate the castle.

54
00:03:20,617 --> 00:03:22,076
How are you doing that?

55
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:24,287
I practice at home.

56
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:27,373
[sighs]

57
00:03:33,421 --> 00:03:34,631
[humming]

58
00:03:43,806 --> 00:03:46,726
<i>Move. Now. We don't have all night, Kyle.</i>

59
00:03:46,809 --> 00:03:49,229
Meow. You all right there, kitten?

60
00:03:49,437 --> 00:03:51,272
<i>About time you checked in.</i>

61
00:03:51,356 --> 00:03:54,400
<i>Are the Princesses</i>
<i>still moping around about Dryl?</i>

62
00:03:54,484 --> 00:03:55,735
[scoffs] No.

63
00:03:55,818 --> 00:03:57,904
Watching them mope was my favorite.

64
00:03:57,987 --> 00:03:59,781
Now they're playing detective,

65
00:03:59,864 --> 00:04:03,952
searching for the elusive Horde spy
who foiled their plans.

66
00:04:04,535 --> 00:04:06,788
<i>Wait. Spy? Is your cover blown?</i>

67
00:04:06,871 --> 00:04:10,833
Please. Who would suspect
a goody-two-shoes like Flutterina?

68
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:14,629
Besides, if they get suspicious,
I'll do a quick wardrobe change

69
00:04:14,712 --> 00:04:16,965
and throw the blame onto someone else.

70
00:04:18,341 --> 00:04:21,219
<i>They better not. Keep them in Bright Moon.</i>

71
00:04:21,302 --> 00:04:23,304
<i>If they catch on</i>
<i>before the plan is complete,</i>

72
00:04:23,388 --> 00:04:25,098
<i>before our big mission is done, I--</i>

73
00:04:25,181 --> 00:04:27,684
Darling, darling, don't worry.

74
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:29,769
I'll just tire them out a bit.

75
00:04:31,396 --> 00:04:34,190
Where were you when the murders happened?

76
00:04:35,149 --> 00:04:36,776
-The what?
-[Perfuma grunts]

77
00:04:37,402 --> 00:04:38,569
[grunting]

78
00:04:38,903 --> 00:04:41,114
Don't think you can get away with it.

79
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:44,993
Although there still
aren't any murders, Mermista.

80
00:04:45,076 --> 00:04:46,619
-Yet.
-[grunts]

81
00:04:47,203 --> 00:04:49,998
I sincerely do not have time for this.

82
00:04:50,081 --> 00:04:52,125
According to a bunch of other people...

83
00:04:52,208 --> 00:04:53,418
Witnesses.

84
00:04:53,501 --> 00:04:56,796
you weren't where you were supposed to be
at the battle for Dryl.

85
00:04:56,879 --> 00:04:58,631
I followed the plan exactly.

86
00:04:58,798 --> 00:05:00,300
[grunts] A likely--

87
00:05:00,883 --> 00:05:03,594
Sorry, a likely story.

88
00:05:03,678 --> 00:05:07,682
Admit it. You were slipping away
to warn the Horde of our plan.

89
00:05:07,765 --> 00:05:11,311
Just like in <i>Mer-Mystery:</i>
<i>Secret of the Abalone.</i>

90
00:05:11,394 --> 00:05:13,896
That one's really good.
You should read it.

91
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:19,610
Look, this is what happened.

92
00:05:19,944 --> 00:05:24,365
<i>On approach to Dryl, Glimmer filled me in.</i>
<i>She-Ra would lure away the Horde.</i>

93
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:27,660
<i>Team A, Frosta, Bow, and Flutterina,</i>
<i>would scout ahead.</i>

94
00:05:27,744 --> 00:05:30,955
<i>Team B, Sea Hawk and Mermista,</i>
<i>would guard the exits.</i>

95
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:35,251
<i>Team A indicated the coast was clear,</i>
<i>and we converged on their signal.</i>

96
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:46,804
<i>-That's when Frosta ran into us and said:</i>
-We haven't finished scouting.

97
00:05:47,555 --> 00:05:48,723
[Bow shouting]

98
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:53,686
Oh, my.

99
00:05:56,064 --> 00:05:57,607
Team A sent the all-clear.

100
00:05:57,690 --> 00:06:00,526
If you wanna know
what went wrong, ask Bow.

101
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:03,154
Okay, I confess, it was me.

102
00:06:03,738 --> 00:06:05,740
We're not even interrogating you.

103
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:10,536
I mean, if I am the spy, it's an accident.
I think. Can you be an accidental spy?

104
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:12,288
Do I have an evil alter-ego?

105
00:06:12,371 --> 00:06:15,333
Or was I brainwashed
and I'm just realizing it now?

106
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:18,544
So, like, are you guys
still questioning me or...?

107
00:06:20,004 --> 00:06:22,507
It all goes back to what happened in Dryl.

108
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:25,384
<i>Everyone was in position,</i>

109
00:06:25,468 --> 00:06:29,263
<i>and I was using my new tech</i>
<i>to look for remaining Horde soldiers.</i>

110
00:06:35,561 --> 00:06:38,397
<i>But then, my goggles glitched,</i>
<i>and I don't know what happened.</i>

111
00:06:38,481 --> 00:06:40,108
<i>I started to see double.</i>

112
00:06:40,191 --> 00:06:42,568
<i>That's when the other team</i>
<i>came in way too early.</i>

113
00:06:43,194 --> 00:06:46,447
<i>I tried to signal everyone to fall back,</i>
<i>but my tracker pad was missing.</i>

114
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:55,456
Whoa.

115
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:57,542
Don't you see what this means?

116
00:06:57,625 --> 00:06:59,585
Either I lost my tracker pad at Dryl,

117
00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:02,171
and that gave the Horde vital information,

118
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:05,299
or I did it on purpose
because I am the spy,

119
00:07:05,383 --> 00:07:08,052
and I gave the signal
and I didn't even know.

120
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:10,263
You're blowing my mind.

121
00:07:10,346 --> 00:07:12,890
Bow! You aren't the spy.

122
00:07:13,474 --> 00:07:14,725
You don't know that.

123
00:07:14,809 --> 00:07:16,310
It all makes sense.

124
00:07:16,394 --> 00:07:17,645
Who else could it be?

125
00:07:21,816 --> 00:07:23,025
So you're telling us

126
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:26,404
you really didn't know
about the plan to retake Dryl?

127
00:07:26,988 --> 00:07:28,197
-Really?
-Not a bit.

128
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:30,116
I've been busy with my garden.

129
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:32,785
She's always been paranoid
like this, you know.

130
00:07:33,619 --> 00:07:34,704
[chuckles]

131
00:07:34,787 --> 00:07:36,789
I am not being paranoid.

132
00:07:36,873 --> 00:07:39,917
You were spotted around the castle
without your guards this morning,

133
00:07:40,001 --> 00:07:41,502
and I wanna know why.

134
00:07:41,586 --> 00:07:43,254
Actually, Adora, that's--

135
00:07:43,337 --> 00:07:45,548
I was engaging in a ritual.

136
00:07:48,551 --> 00:07:51,179
Essence of echinacea.

137
00:07:51,762 --> 00:07:55,308
A dash of ginger root.

138
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:01,731
Ah. My daily morning ritual.

139
00:08:01,814 --> 00:08:03,107
[laughing]

140
00:08:03,441 --> 00:08:06,986
Okay, you expect us to believe
you were just having tea?

141
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:10,281
She's the spy. You're the spy.
Who else could it be?

142
00:08:10,364 --> 00:08:13,409
[Shadow Weaver]
I am not the villain of this story.

143
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:14,785
As to your question,

144
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:17,914
Glimmer saw fit to grant me
free rein of the castle.

145
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:20,208
My guards have been dismissed.

146
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:23,503
No guards, seriously?

147
00:08:23,586 --> 00:08:24,921
Yes, seriously.

148
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:28,466
-What has she done other than help us?
-Do you really want me to answer that?

149
00:08:28,549 --> 00:08:32,929
Girls, every moment you waste here,
the Horde gets that much further ahead.

150
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:37,183
In order to catch a rat,
you need to spring a trap.

151
00:08:37,266 --> 00:08:42,188
Well, in order to catch the spy,
we need you to admit that you're the spy.

152
00:08:42,271 --> 00:08:46,234
Let it go, Adora.
There's lots of other people it could be.

153
00:08:46,317 --> 00:08:47,318
Like who?

154
00:08:47,735 --> 00:08:48,778
[Sea Hawk] Ah.

155
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:52,532
I love recounting
the epic tales of my exploits.

156
00:08:52,615 --> 00:08:54,867
My heroic exploits.

157
00:08:54,951 --> 00:08:57,161
[groaning]

158
00:08:57,745 --> 00:09:01,249
It definitely isn't Sea Hawk.
Why did you even bring him in?

159
00:09:01,332 --> 00:09:03,251
You said everyone was a suspect.

160
00:09:03,334 --> 00:09:05,294
[Sea Hawk] Exploits for the ages.

161
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:06,963
Narration.

162
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:12,218
<i>I was supposed to be guarding the door.</i>

163
00:09:12,301 --> 00:09:16,347
<i>But Perfuma relieved me of duty,</i>
<i>so I could join the fight.</i>

164
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,603
<i>I advanced through the courtyard,</i>

165
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:24,397
<i>avoiding the booby traps,</i>

166
00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:30,486
<i>risking my very life, just like</i>
<i>in </i>Mer-Mystery: Serpent of the Sea.

167
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:34,824
Wait, is that where my book went?
Sea Hawk, I've been looking for it.

168
00:09:34,907 --> 00:09:36,951
That's when the clouds parted,

169
00:09:37,034 --> 00:09:42,290
<i>and the moonlight illuminated</i>

[Mermista] <i>Moonlight? The battle happened</i>
<i>this morning.</i>

172
00:09:50,715 --> 00:09:52,883
[Sea Hawk] <i>I made my way</i>
<i>over to her, when...</i>

173
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:53,926
[gasps]

174
00:09:54,802 --> 00:09:56,554
<i>we were ambushed.</i>

175
00:09:56,637 --> 00:10:00,433
<i>My sole aim was to protect Mermista</i>
<i>from the Horde.</i>

176
00:10:00,516 --> 00:10:06,188
<i>Thinking quick, I took on</i>
<i>the 40 to 50 Horde soldiers surrounding us</i>

177
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:08,691
<i>and saved Dryl.</i>

178
00:10:09,775 --> 00:10:14,155
We lost Dryl, and you punched,
like, one guy before Glimmer got us out.

179
00:10:14,238 --> 00:10:16,866
Exactly, 100 guys.

180
00:10:18,075 --> 00:10:21,162
Wait, wait, I was with the General
the whole time.

181
00:10:22,163 --> 00:10:25,541
And why weren't you
with Sea Hawk, Mermista?

182
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:29,170
Because Frosta waved me over,
but disappeared before I could reach her.

183
00:10:29,253 --> 00:10:30,713
But that doesn't make any sense.

184
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:33,591
She was with Bow, and then Glimmer,
and then the others were--

185
00:10:33,674 --> 00:10:36,135
Who wants to watch me do some squats?

186
00:10:41,265 --> 00:10:44,435
I bet Adora and Glimmer
don't shove suspects out the door.

187
00:10:52,443 --> 00:10:53,444
[groans]

188
00:10:54,028 --> 00:10:57,823
Okay, Flutterina, where were you
at the start of the battle?

189
00:10:58,407 --> 00:11:01,202
With Bow and Frosta, of course.
Like we planned.

190
00:11:02,036 --> 00:11:03,412
Is everything okay?

191
00:11:05,998 --> 00:11:07,541
Everything is fine. Now--

192
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:10,961
It's just that, everyone's so on edge
after what happened in Dryl.

193
00:11:11,045 --> 00:11:13,339
Have you tried interviewing
Shadow Weaver about it?

194
00:11:13,422 --> 00:11:15,508
She seems kind of untrustworthy.

195
00:11:15,591 --> 00:11:18,844
Oh, no, according to Glimmer,
she's totally trustworthy,

196
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:22,264
and it's fine to just let her walk
around the castle whenever she wants.

197
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:24,725
Can you please not start this up again?

198
00:11:24,809 --> 00:11:27,228
I'm just saying,
it would've been nice if you told me.

199
00:11:27,311 --> 00:11:30,064
I don't have to tell you
about every decision I make.

200
00:11:30,147 --> 00:11:31,107
[panting]

201
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:33,317
But you tell Shadow Weaver?

202
00:11:33,401 --> 00:11:35,778
Maybe it's because Shadow Weaver
actually listened

203
00:11:35,861 --> 00:11:38,656
when you and Bow kept leaving without me!

204
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,951
You two seem like you have
a lot to talk about.

205
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:43,786
Maybe I'll just come back later.

206
00:11:43,869 --> 00:11:45,955
I don't know
why I'm going along with this.

207
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:48,290
The Horde is obviously planning something.

208
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:52,378
We should be out there, looking for them,
not stuck here, playing around.

209
00:11:52,461 --> 00:11:56,090
No one's playing around, Glimmer.
There is a reason we've been losing.

210
00:11:56,173 --> 00:11:59,718
And we're going to keep losing
if we don't act soon.

211
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:01,971
-[shouts]
-There you are.

212
00:12:02,054 --> 00:12:03,722
Why are you just standing around?

213
00:12:03,806 --> 00:12:07,184
This isn't <i>Mer-Mystery: The Case Of People</i>
<i>Who Just Stood Around,</i>

214
00:12:07,268 --> 00:12:10,354
the sequel I wrote right now
about all of you.

215
00:12:10,438 --> 00:12:12,606
Who is even left to question?

216
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:15,443
I think I saw Mermista
with Bow's tracker pad.

217
00:12:15,526 --> 00:12:18,112
Wait, you guys have been here
the entire time?

218
00:12:19,488 --> 00:12:21,031
Tiny scone?

219
00:12:21,699 --> 00:12:23,325
I can't believe you read those too.

220
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:25,619
<i>Mer-Mystery: The Maltese Otter</i>
is my favorite.

221
00:12:25,703 --> 00:12:27,997
Ugh, that one's so predictable.

222
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,291
I saw that twist coming a mile away.

223
00:12:30,374 --> 00:12:31,959
[neighing]

224
00:12:32,042 --> 00:12:35,379
-Swift Wind, you weren't even there.
-I told you how I took out 100--

225
00:12:35,463 --> 00:12:39,383
-No, 150 guys, right?
-[Mermista groans]

226
00:12:39,467 --> 00:12:43,012
You have to arrest me
for everyone's safety.

227
00:12:43,095 --> 00:12:46,098
Otherwise, my evil alter-ego
might do it again.

228
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:47,266
Bow, knock it off.

229
00:12:47,558 --> 00:12:49,018
[neighing]

230
00:12:49,935 --> 00:12:51,645
Still no. And put that back.

231
00:12:51,729 --> 00:12:53,230
[Mermista] It's not them.

232
00:12:53,772 --> 00:12:55,983
-[Perfuma] No.
-[Glimmer] No.

233
00:12:56,066 --> 00:12:59,737
Okay, dude, I think,
like, maybe She-Ra did it.

234
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:01,947
[Frosta] Hey, we already questioned you.

235
00:13:02,031 --> 00:13:04,742
Oh, yeah, I came back for the tiny scones.

236
00:13:04,825 --> 00:13:06,160
I made a fresh batch.

237
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:07,870
Fizzy beverage?

238
00:13:07,953 --> 00:13:09,205
[chattering]

239
00:13:10,539 --> 00:13:13,292
If you just lent me the book,
then I'll show you who done it.

240
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:16,462
-We should interrogate him again.
-Happened in <i>Pearl in the Window.</i>

241
00:13:24,178 --> 00:13:26,472
Glimmer? Where are you going?

242
00:13:27,056 --> 00:13:28,432
This isn't working.

243
00:13:28,516 --> 00:13:30,559
Nothing we do is working.

244
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:31,852
The Horde is always ahead,

245
00:13:31,936 --> 00:13:35,231
and I can't just wait
for the next bad thing to happen.

246
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:37,650
So, what? You're gonna teleport
into the Fright Zone

247
00:13:37,733 --> 00:13:39,318
and try to solve this by yourself?

248
00:13:39,401 --> 00:13:41,278
Someone's gotta do something.

249
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:43,531
Glimmer, please.

250
00:13:43,614 --> 00:13:46,283
You can't leave in the middle of the night
without backup.

251
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:50,454
The less people involved, the better.
We don't know who to trust.

252
00:13:50,538 --> 00:13:54,041
And what about me?
Were you gonna tell me? Or Bow?

253
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:56,335
-Adora, I--
-Stay.

254
00:13:56,919 --> 00:13:58,128
Please.

255
00:13:58,212 --> 00:14:00,673
I know we can figure this out
if we work together.

256
00:14:00,756 --> 00:14:03,300
No more secrets
and doing things without us.

257
00:14:03,884 --> 00:14:05,219
We need you here.

258
00:14:06,053 --> 00:14:07,471
I need you here.

259
00:14:11,642 --> 00:14:13,936
Okay. I'm here.

260
00:14:15,813 --> 00:14:17,314
[Bow] Adora! Glimmer!

261
00:14:17,398 --> 00:14:19,316
Where have you guys been?

262
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:22,528
The communications panel
in the War Room has been severed.

263
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:26,949
When did this happen?

264
00:14:27,032 --> 00:14:29,702
I don't know. We were passing
by the room when we saw it.

265
00:14:29,785 --> 00:14:32,621
Wait, we saw you run out of here
two minutes ago.

266
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:35,416
Uh, what are you talking about?
I was with Perfuma.

267
00:14:35,499 --> 00:14:38,127
Could the storm have done something
to cause this?

268
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:39,336
This wasn't an accident.

269
00:14:41,922 --> 00:14:43,340
This was sabotage.

270
00:15:04,778 --> 00:15:07,948
The General is working
on restoring communications.

271
00:15:08,032 --> 00:15:12,786
In the meantime, there's a backup device
in the dining room, should we need it.

272
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:16,498
All of us here knew
we were trying to unmask the spy.

273
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:19,418
And we were the ones
who made the plan to take back Dryl.

274
00:15:19,501 --> 00:15:21,754
We've ruled out all other suspects.

275
00:15:21,837 --> 00:15:26,550
Which means the only person
the spy could be is one of us.

276
00:15:26,634 --> 00:15:27,635
[gasps]

277
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:34,391
Perfuma let the Horde take the doors.

278
00:15:34,475 --> 00:15:35,935
I wasn't there.

279
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:39,772
[gasps] Wait, your team was the one
who told us to come in,

280
00:15:39,855 --> 00:15:41,523
and you led Mermista away.

281
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:43,233
I did not.

282
00:15:43,817 --> 00:15:46,654
Trying to throw the blame
on someone else, huh, Frosta?

283
00:15:46,737 --> 00:15:49,281
If Mermista knows so much about mysteries,

284
00:15:49,365 --> 00:15:52,284
she'd probably know
how to plan the perfect crime.

285
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:54,703
And there was water by the tracker pad.

286
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:57,289
Water that could've been melted ice.

287
00:15:57,373 --> 00:15:58,499
It's probably me.

288
00:15:58,582 --> 00:16:00,626
It's not you, Bow!

289
00:16:00,709 --> 00:16:03,587
Or maybe it is,
like in <i>Mer-Mystery: Salt-er Ego.</i>

290
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:07,841
It couldn't be me. I was busy fighting
at least 200 soldiers.

291
00:16:07,925 --> 00:16:10,260
This is a waste of time, Glimmer.
Shouldn't we be--?

292
00:16:10,344 --> 00:16:11,428
Stop.

293
00:16:11,512 --> 00:16:13,180
Stop questioning my choices,

294
00:16:13,263 --> 00:16:16,350
stop whining
about being a decoy, just stop.

295
00:16:16,433 --> 00:16:18,602
-Okay?
-I'm not whining.

296
00:16:18,686 --> 00:16:22,481
[Glimmer] All you do is question me,
question my authority.

297
00:16:22,564 --> 00:16:24,066
It's exhausting.

298
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:25,359
[shouting]

299
00:16:27,277 --> 00:16:29,113
Okay, I lied.

300
00:16:29,196 --> 00:16:31,657
I didn't fight 300 soldiers.

301
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:34,410
Mermista, will you ever forgive me?

302
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:36,912
Sea Hawk, we all knew that.

303
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:40,541
I don't know who to believe anymore.
I can't trust my own eyes.

304
00:16:40,624 --> 00:16:42,668
-Who am I?
-[Adora] Look at what she's doing.

305
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:44,753
Look at what she's doing to you.

306
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:47,506
Shadow Weaver wants power,
and you are listening to her.

307
00:16:47,589 --> 00:16:52,177
Oh, what? Are you jealous because you
aren't Shadow Weaver's favorite anymore?

308
00:16:52,261 --> 00:16:56,515
Or are you just mad that I'm queen
and in charge and you're not?

309
00:16:56,598 --> 00:16:58,183
That's ridiculous.

310
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:01,311
You just run around
playing the perfect hero.

311
00:17:01,395 --> 00:17:04,023
You have no idea
how hard it's been for me.

312
00:17:04,106 --> 00:17:07,067
Because you stopped
including me in your decisions.

313
00:17:07,151 --> 00:17:11,321
We used to be a team. And now?
I don't know what we are.

314
00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:22,499
Come on, backup communicator,
where are you?

315
00:17:24,001 --> 00:17:24,960
Hey, Flutterina.

316
00:17:25,669 --> 00:17:27,212
Looking for something?

317
00:17:27,588 --> 00:17:29,339
Glimmer? Heh. Adora.

318
00:17:29,423 --> 00:17:32,259
Hi, hi. Uh, just looking for the bathroom.

319
00:17:34,803 --> 00:17:35,888
[chuckles]

320
00:17:36,972 --> 00:17:40,934
Okay. Okay. This looks bad,
but it isn't what it looks like.

321
00:17:41,018 --> 00:17:43,312
So let's all just...

322
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:45,272
[shouts]

323
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:53,697
Oh. [laughing]

324
00:17:54,281 --> 00:17:55,866
I see.

325
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:59,745
Give it up, Flutterina.
If that's really who you are.

326
00:17:59,828 --> 00:18:02,915
Magic. How very clever.

327
00:18:02,998 --> 00:18:05,417
Isn't it? Shadow Weaver helped.

328
00:18:05,501 --> 00:18:06,376
You see--

329
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:09,588
The reveal of how they caught
the murderer is my favorite part.

330
00:18:10,172 --> 00:18:11,048
[groans]

331
00:18:11,381 --> 00:18:14,343
[Adora] <i>In order to catch a rat,</i>
<i>you need to spring a trap.</i>

332
00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:16,595
<i>So we set one up of our own.</i>

333
00:18:16,678 --> 00:18:18,472
[Mermista] <i>Classic murder mystery move.</i>

334
00:18:18,555 --> 00:18:21,016
[Perfuma] <i>There's no murder-- Never mind.</i>

335
00:18:21,225 --> 00:18:23,936
[Glimmer]
<i>We knew a backup communication device</i>

336
00:18:24,019 --> 00:18:27,272
<i>would be irresistible</i>
<i>to whoever destroyed the original.</i>

337
00:18:30,025 --> 00:18:32,528
[Adora] <i>We wanted the spy to feel</i>
<i>safe enough to make a move,</i>

338
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:34,488
<i>so we created a diversion.</i>

339
00:18:35,072 --> 00:18:38,867
[Glimmer] <i>Adora managed to be</i>
<i>a really good actress, for once.</i>

340
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:41,703
[Adora] <i>It was really hard.</i>
<i>Do not ask me to do that again.</i>

341
00:18:43,705 --> 00:18:45,624
So that brings us back to you.

342
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:48,502
Who are you really, Flutterina?

343
00:18:50,921 --> 00:18:52,005
[shouting]

344
00:18:52,673 --> 00:18:53,507
[gasps]

345
00:18:59,763 --> 00:19:00,889
Please...

346
00:19:01,598 --> 00:19:03,392
call me Double Trouble.

347
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:05,144
You're a shape-shifter?

348
00:19:05,227 --> 00:19:06,353
[gasps]

349
00:19:06,687 --> 00:19:08,689
It wasn't my goggles glitching.

350
00:19:08,772 --> 00:19:11,817
It was you,
pretending to be Frosta at Dryl.

351
00:19:12,401 --> 00:19:15,904
And Perfuma.
Don't shortchange my credits, darling.

352
00:19:19,241 --> 00:19:20,367
[all gasping]

353
00:19:20,909 --> 00:19:26,665
May I say, as one actor to another,
that was truly a masterful performance.

354
00:19:26,748 --> 00:19:30,002
I really bought that you two
were furious at each other.

355
00:19:30,085 --> 00:19:31,211
If you would indulge me,

356
00:19:31,295 --> 00:19:35,090
were you inspired
from any real emotion or experience?

357
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:40,554
Enough. It's over, Double Trouble.
Now tell us what the Horde is planning.

358
00:19:40,637 --> 00:19:41,722
[Double Trouble] Over?

359
00:19:41,805 --> 00:19:45,642
Oh, love, it's just beginning.

360
00:19:45,726 --> 00:19:49,479
The Horde has been planning
a massive attack for some time now.

361
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:52,816
<i>I let Catra know</i>
<i>that you were going to Dryl.</i>

362
00:19:59,072 --> 00:20:02,159
<i>After that, all I had to do</i>
<i>was plant seeds of doubt.</i>

363
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:08,707
<i>Sowing chaos where I could.</i>

364
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:10,292
[groans]

365
00:20:13,503 --> 00:20:14,922
[both laughing]

366
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:30,604
Bow, seriously, you aren't the spy.

367
00:20:30,687 --> 00:20:31,897
Hey. Mermista?

368
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:33,482
[Double Trouble] <i>It wasn't hard.</i>

369
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:36,985
<i>I just had to keep you isolated</i>
<i>and at each other's throats</i>

370
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:40,113
<i>until the plan was underway.</i>

371
00:20:53,377 --> 00:20:54,795
<i>Salineas.</i>

372
00:20:54,878 --> 00:20:59,174
<i>If the Horde controls the seas,</i>
<i>they control Etheria.</i>

373
00:21:06,556 --> 00:21:08,934
That will never happen. We won't let it.

374
00:21:09,017 --> 00:21:11,353
Now that we know their plan,
we can stop it.

375
00:21:11,436 --> 00:21:12,437
No. Stop it?

376
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:16,692
Oh, this was a ruse, darling.
A distraction.

377
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:19,903
The Battle of Salineas is over.

378
00:21:20,487 --> 00:21:23,865
It happened earlier this very evening.
It's too late.

379
00:21:24,241 --> 00:21:25,742
Salineas is gone.

380
00:21:25,826 --> 00:21:27,077
-No.
-No.

381
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:29,538
No, it's not too late. It can't be.

382
00:21:39,172 --> 00:21:40,340
[sobs]

383
00:21:56,064 --> 00:21:57,482
We can fix this.

384
00:21:57,566 --> 00:22:00,485
We have to be able to fix this, right?

385
00:22:08,702 --> 00:22:10,912
[Glimmer] This won't happen again.

386
00:22:11,955 --> 00:22:13,290
I won't let it.

387
00:22:13,749 --> 00:22:15,334
We won't give up.

388
00:22:15,625 --> 00:22:18,211
We will take back Salineas.

389
00:22:18,295 --> 00:22:19,880
Take back all of Etheria.

390
00:22:20,714 --> 00:22:22,966
<i>No matter what it costs.</i>

391
00:22:25,969 --> 00:22:29,556
<i>No matter</i>
<i>what the Horde throws at us next.</i>

392
00:22:42,736 --> 00:22:44,154
[closing theme playing]
