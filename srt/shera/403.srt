This time I am going to win.
I don't care what it takes.

We are opening that portal. Now.

00:00:28,903 --> 00:00:32,449
No. I won't.
I need to tell Hordak. He'll understand.

00:00:38,872 --> 00:00:40,165

Hmm. Ouch.

26
00:02:08,628 --> 00:02:09,879
What happened here?

27
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:13,800
[groans] The rebels managed to capture
one of our bots

28
00:02:13,883 --> 00:02:16,970
and retrofit it
with some sort of surge device.

29
00:02:17,053 --> 00:02:20,265
It decimated an entire squadron
of our machines.

30
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:23,476
Not to speak ill of the dearly departed,

31
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:29,023
but exactly how many battles
have your bots lost us lately?

32
00:02:29,107 --> 00:02:31,776
You'd be wise to watch your tone.

33
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:34,529
Aren't you tired of losing?

34
00:02:34,612 --> 00:02:36,447
After all, clock's ticking.

35
00:02:36,531 --> 00:02:38,533
Big Brother Prime could show up
any moment.

36
00:02:38,616 --> 00:02:42,829
Even you, Catra, should fear
being this bold in my presence. I--

37
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:48,626
Cool trick, huh?

38
00:02:50,962 --> 00:02:54,549
Lord Hordak, I'd like to introduce you
to Double Trouble.

39
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:57,969
They're our newest asset
in taking down the Rebellion.

40
00:02:59,053 --> 00:03:02,599
Apologies for being rude.
I was getting into character.

41
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:04,350
Did it work? Be honest.

42
00:03:04,434 --> 00:03:06,936
I'm open to constructive criticism.

43
00:03:07,979 --> 00:03:09,606
A shape-shifter.

44
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:11,858
Impressive indeed.

45
00:03:11,941 --> 00:03:14,736
Do not attempt to deceive me again.

46
00:03:19,198 --> 00:03:20,033
[grunts]

47
00:03:24,078 --> 00:03:26,122
So, what's all this about?

48
00:03:26,789 --> 00:03:29,834
The bots were a part
of the occupation of Elberon.

49
00:03:29,918 --> 00:03:31,127
A failed operation.

50
00:03:31,544 --> 00:03:33,171
The rebels seized the town.

51
00:03:33,463 --> 00:03:37,175
It seems their technological capabilities
have increased since--

52
00:03:37,508 --> 00:03:39,469
Since Entrapta returned to them.

53
00:03:40,094 --> 00:03:42,055
It is of no consequence.

54
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:46,851
I will improve our machines
and we will seize Elberon back.

55
00:03:46,935 --> 00:03:48,603
Elberon? Why?

56
00:03:48,686 --> 00:03:51,856
It may have escaped your notice,
but we are trying to win a war.

57
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:54,359
See, you're thinking about this wrong.

58
00:03:54,609 --> 00:03:56,277
Elberon doesn't matter.

59
00:03:56,361 --> 00:03:59,280
It's what it can do for us that counts.

60
00:04:00,823 --> 00:04:03,117
And what do you propose?

61
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:13,378
[Bow] <i>That's when Adora turned her sword</i>
<i>into a giant spear,</i>

62
00:04:13,461 --> 00:04:17,924
<i>skewered a bot,</i>
<i>and then used the bot to hit more bots.</i>

63
00:04:18,007 --> 00:04:20,927
<i>Then Bow used his oil slick arrow</i>
<i>to slip them up,</i>

64
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:23,137
<i>and then right off a cliff. Bam!</i>

65
00:04:23,221 --> 00:04:24,472
<i>And I kicked them.</i>

66
00:04:24,555 --> 00:04:26,224
Yes! Get them.

67
00:04:26,307 --> 00:04:29,102
<i>But we were totally surrounded.</i>
<i>And then...</i>

68
00:04:29,185 --> 00:04:31,562
<i>My new surge device worked perfectly.</i>

69
00:04:31,646 --> 00:04:34,524
<i>Took out the rest of the bots in one go.</i>

70
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:35,900
<i>And I kicked them.</i>

71
00:04:35,984 --> 00:04:40,780
Amazing. Those bots didn't stand a chance
against the Best Friend Squad.

72
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:41,864
[gasps]

73
00:04:46,744 --> 00:04:48,871
I really wish I could've been there.

74
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:50,999
<i>At least you'll be back soon, right?</i>

75
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:52,875
Uh...

76
00:04:53,376 --> 00:04:57,547
Soon. Yeah. There's just
one more thing we have to take care of.

77
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:59,882
Just some really boring wrap-up stuff.

78
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:01,926
The people love us
because we saved Elberon,

79
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:04,554
so they're throwing us
a celebratory dinner.

80
00:05:04,637 --> 00:05:07,932
Heh. A dinner? That sounds fun.

81
00:05:08,016 --> 00:05:10,351
Oh, it's really not a big deal.

82
00:05:10,435 --> 00:05:12,937
Yeah, I bet they do this for everyone.

83
00:05:13,062 --> 00:05:15,773
<i>You guys, of course they wanna thank you.</i>

84
00:05:15,857 --> 00:05:18,109
<i>You freed a whole town from Horde control.</i>

85
00:05:18,192 --> 00:05:19,610
<i>I just...</i> [grunts]

86
00:05:20,778 --> 00:05:23,823
Well, if you need us, we can totally
skip out on this dinner thing.

87
00:05:23,906 --> 00:05:26,242
No way. Go enjoy your victory.

88
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:29,329
Great, because I am famished.
Are we going now?

89
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:32,582
[Bow] You really aren't missing anything.

90
00:05:32,665 --> 00:05:36,002
You know, we'll drop by to be polite
and then head home.

91
00:05:36,085 --> 00:05:38,504
Yep. I'm sure it'll be super boring.

92
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:39,922
[all shouting]

93
00:05:42,675 --> 00:05:44,343
<i>What is it? What's going on?</i>

94
00:05:44,427 --> 00:05:47,555
-Nothing. Super boring.
-Gotta go. Wish you were here.

95
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:03,905
[laughing]

96
00:06:07,075 --> 00:06:08,284
Ooh.

97
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:10,745
It's a party.

98
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:12,830
It's a big party.

99
00:06:12,914 --> 00:06:14,415
And it's for us.

100
00:06:14,499 --> 00:06:16,375
It's a big party for us.

101
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:19,670
As individuals? Is that normal?
Does this happen often?

102
00:06:19,754 --> 00:06:22,632
Ah, there you are. Our heroes.

103
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:26,469
Oh, we couldn't possibly thank you enough
for liberating our town.

104
00:06:27,261 --> 00:06:29,055
We sort of do this a lot.

105
00:06:29,138 --> 00:06:32,517
You really, really didn't
have to go to all this trouble.

106
00:06:33,142 --> 00:06:35,103
It was supposed to be a small dinner.

107
00:06:35,186 --> 00:06:40,108
You know, a quiet meal, but then word
got out and suddenly everyone's invited.

108
00:06:40,191 --> 00:06:41,442
So here we are.

109
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:46,447
Rowdy, calling attention to ourselves,
basically sitting targets.

110
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:47,949
-[explosion]
-What was that?

111
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:54,372
Okay, okay. Terrifying booming sounds
were probably a bad idea.

112
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:57,708
She-Ra. You saved us.

113
00:06:57,792 --> 00:06:59,460
[grunts, then laughing]

114
00:06:59,544 --> 00:07:02,255
I mean, it's my job.
It's what I do. It's...

115
00:07:02,338 --> 00:07:04,298
So it's not a big deal. At all.

116
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:07,468
And Tech Master Bow of the Rebellion.

117
00:07:07,635 --> 00:07:09,887
Oh, you have to show off
your arrows to the kids.

118
00:07:09,971 --> 00:07:12,098
-They're obsessed with them.
-Really?

119
00:07:14,976 --> 00:07:16,769
[gasps] Hey.

120
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,772
We've heard stories of your victories,

121
00:07:19,856 --> 00:07:22,942
but to see you destroy
those bots in person? Mm.

122
00:07:23,192 --> 00:07:24,193
Amazing.

123
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:26,028
That's nothing compared to when She-Ra

124
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:28,072
took on the monsters
of the Northern Reach.

125
00:07:28,156 --> 00:07:30,992
Or when she single-handedly
won the Battle of Bright Moon.

126
00:07:31,868 --> 00:07:35,621
Oh, I wouldn't say single-handedly.
I mean, I guess I--

127
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:38,541
I guess I played kind of
an important part.

128
00:07:38,624 --> 00:07:40,710
Kind of important? Try huge.

129
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:44,255
You fought off the Horde, you united
the Princesses, and you saved Etheria,

130
00:07:44,338 --> 00:07:46,799
and you are the coolest.

131
00:07:46,883 --> 00:07:50,511
Uh, yeah, I mean, that was pretty cool,
wasn't it? [laughs]

132
00:07:50,595 --> 00:07:53,347
One day, I'm gonna leave Elberon
and join the Rebellion,

133
00:07:53,431 --> 00:07:55,183
fighting side-by-side with you.

134
00:07:55,766 --> 00:07:57,393
I'm Flutterina, by the way.

135
00:07:58,227 --> 00:08:02,106
Oh! I'm shaking hands with She-Ra.

136
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:14,869
Can you believe this?
All of this is for us.

137
00:08:14,952 --> 00:08:16,454
People like us.

138
00:08:17,788 --> 00:08:20,500
But we told Glimmer we wouldn't stay long.

139
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:23,961
I mean, but we have to stay.

140
00:08:24,045 --> 00:08:27,173
It would be rude not to. Right?

141
00:08:27,256 --> 00:08:31,844
Right. We'll just stay for a minute
and then-- Me cake! There's a me cake!

142
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:33,930
[both gasping]

143
00:08:34,388 --> 00:08:36,599
This is the best party ever.

144
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:42,813
[all gasping]

145
00:08:46,734 --> 00:08:47,693
[shouting]

146
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:57,161
[crowd cheering]

147
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:58,829

148
00:09:17,932 --> 00:09:19,100

[both laughing]

151
00:09:32,363 --> 00:09:33,322
Whoo!

152
00:09:33,948 --> 00:09:35,283
Yeah.

153
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:41,122
This is so fun.

154
00:09:41,497 --> 00:09:43,207
They've got stories about me.

155
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:47,587
Not some long ago She-Ra of the past.
Me, and what I did.

156
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:49,005
I know, right?

157
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:52,508
This is awesome.
We should rescue Elberon more often.

158
00:09:53,384 --> 00:09:56,178
-It's the Horde.
-We must get the villagers to safety.

159
00:09:56,762 --> 00:09:58,598
Our scouts have reported a bot.

160
00:09:58,681 --> 00:10:01,392
It's bigger than anything we've seen.
It's on its way here.

161
00:10:01,475 --> 00:10:03,811
Oh, we need to evacuate the town. Now.

162
00:10:05,396 --> 00:10:07,231
Everyone, stay calm.

163
00:10:07,315 --> 00:10:11,569
You're under our protection.
Let She-Ra handle this.

164
00:10:11,652 --> 00:10:15,364
[all] She-Ra. She-Ra. She-Ra.

165
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:16,741
She-Ra!

166
00:10:17,825 --> 00:10:20,369
-Are you sure we shouldn't prepare?
-[woman] We love you.

167
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:23,164
As I always say, cautious today,
here tomorrow.

168
00:10:23,247 --> 00:10:27,251
Don't worry. After all,
it's my job and I'm pretty good at it.

169
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:29,670
Enjoy the festivities.

170
00:10:30,504 --> 00:10:32,632
[crowd] She-Ra. She-Ra.

171
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:36,093
Why do our parties have to end
with the Horde attacking?

172
00:10:36,177 --> 00:10:39,388
Bow, it's okay. Stay here
and watch the townspeople.

173
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:42,099
-There's no reason for the party to stop.
-Are you sure?

174
00:10:42,183 --> 00:10:46,896
Swift Wind and I can deal with this.
You heard the mayor, it's one bot.

175
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:50,191
How tough can it be for She-Ra?
Just stay and have fun.

176
00:10:50,274 --> 00:10:51,484
We'll be right back.

177
00:10:51,567 --> 00:10:53,736
[Swift Wind]
She-Ra and Swift Wind forever.

178
00:11:02,953 --> 00:11:03,954
Uh...

179
00:11:04,413 --> 00:11:06,165
That one's bigger than usual.

180
00:11:06,248 --> 00:11:07,667
Nothing we can't handle.

181
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:11,212
[shouting and grunting]

182
00:11:21,138 --> 00:11:22,264
Piece of cake, huh?

183
00:11:27,061 --> 00:11:30,606
Does cake normally grow back and turn into
more pieces of cake when you cut it?

184
00:11:34,318 --> 00:11:37,947
Looks like these can multiply. We need
to be careful about how we destroy them.

185
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:40,366
How do we carefully destroy something?

186
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:42,952
Is it magical sacred bond time?

187
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,328
[shouts]

188
00:11:54,588 --> 00:11:55,840
[laughing]

189
00:12:02,513 --> 00:12:04,974
Can't say I'm too impressed
with Hordak's new toys.

190
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:08,394
Did that feel a little too easy to you?

191
00:12:08,477 --> 00:12:11,272
No, like they said in Elberon.
We're awesome.

192
00:12:12,189 --> 00:12:13,899
Let's get back to the party.

193
00:12:14,483 --> 00:12:17,403
Hey, everyone.
Just wait until you hear about...

194
00:12:26,745 --> 00:12:28,289
Where did everyone go?

195
00:12:28,372 --> 00:12:32,501
Is this one of those parties where
people hide and shout "surprise"?

196
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:35,045
He said that happens
before the party starts.

197
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:36,380
Something's wrong.

198
00:12:36,464 --> 00:12:37,590
-[clanging]
-[both shout]

199
00:12:37,673 --> 00:12:39,967
-What was that?
-There.

200
00:12:44,388 --> 00:12:46,474
Huh? You're back.

201
00:12:46,974 --> 00:12:48,267
What happened here?

202
00:12:48,684 --> 00:12:52,229
The Horde, it was awful.
They attacked as soon as you left.

203
00:12:52,313 --> 00:12:56,901
Bow tried to fight, he's the only reason
some people were able to escape.

204
00:12:56,984 --> 00:12:59,111
But they took him and everyone else.

205
00:13:00,237 --> 00:13:01,572
That bot in the woods.

206
00:13:01,655 --> 00:13:05,618
It must have been a diversion
so that I'd leave Elberon defenseless.

207
00:13:05,951 --> 00:13:08,913
And I fell for it. This is my fault.

208
00:13:11,999 --> 00:13:13,250
We need to find them.

209
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:18,839
I know I'm small and I'm not
a Rebellion fighter, but I wanna help.

210
00:13:19,507 --> 00:13:21,300
So, can I come?

211
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:28,349
[grunting]

212
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:30,851
Are you okay?

213
00:13:31,894 --> 00:13:32,853
I'll be fine.

214
00:13:32,937 --> 00:13:33,771
[people crying]

215
00:13:41,237 --> 00:13:42,321
Where are we?

216
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:46,200
Where are my arrows?

217
00:13:46,283 --> 00:13:48,911
The soldiers took our weapons
when they tossed us in here.

218
00:13:48,994 --> 00:13:52,081
We're doomed. What good
is the Tech Master without his tech?

219
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:53,165
Bow without his bow?

220
00:13:53,582 --> 00:13:56,794
We should have evacuated the town
instead of listening to She-Ra.

221
00:13:56,877 --> 00:13:57,878
[chattering]

222
00:13:58,754 --> 00:14:02,174
She-Ra and Swift Wind
won't rest until they find us.

223
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:05,678
But that doesn't mean we can't work
on getting out of here.

224
00:14:05,761 --> 00:14:09,181
I'm still Bow the Tech Master,
even without my arrows.

225
00:14:09,807 --> 00:14:11,809
I can get us out of this.

226
00:14:16,146 --> 00:14:19,567
Look at us.
You and me in the field, side-by-side.

227
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:21,944
Taking a bunch of random prisoners
from a party,

228
00:14:22,027 --> 00:14:25,239
putting said prisoners in a big pit,
guarding said pit.

229
00:14:25,322 --> 00:14:28,492
Ugh, if that doesn't say friendship,
I don't know what does.

230
00:14:28,659 --> 00:14:30,786
The super pal duo is back.

231
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:34,123
-What about the weapons we confiscated?
-Oh, yeah, you gotta see this.

232
00:14:34,498 --> 00:14:35,374
[laughs]

233
00:14:38,836 --> 00:14:40,254
Huh? Huh?

234
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:45,009
I know it's just cut up pieces of paper,
but isn't it so much fun?

235
00:14:45,092 --> 00:14:46,093
We need to focus.

236
00:14:47,052 --> 00:14:49,638
She-Ra was in Elberon.
Which means she's nearby.

237
00:14:50,472 --> 00:14:52,474
Do you think she'll try
some secret attack?

238
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:53,934
Oh, I'm counting on it.

239
00:14:55,477 --> 00:14:59,148
Is that why you kidnapped everyone?
Some plot against the Princess Alliance?

240
00:14:59,231 --> 00:15:02,776
I could help if I knew what you were
up to. You know, like old times.

241
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:05,571
It's for a new strategy,
that's all you need to know.

242
00:15:05,654 --> 00:15:10,075
Oh, yeah, sure, sure, gotcha.
Uh, feeling a little left out is all.

243
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:13,329
You know, ever since
that whole portal thing.

244
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:14,788
Get over it then.

245
00:15:18,459 --> 00:15:19,501
There's the guard post.

246
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:23,380
If we can get inside, we can figure out
where Bow and the others are being held.

247
00:15:23,464 --> 00:15:26,175
How are we supposed to get in there
without being seen?

248
00:15:26,258 --> 00:15:28,761
I mean, you're She-Ra.
And I don't exactly blend in.

249
00:15:29,637 --> 00:15:34,141
-It's a side effect of being majestic.
-I think I have an idea.

250
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:37,436
-[groans]
-[Flutterina] Ahem.

251
00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:41,690
Oh, no. You've caught me.

252
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:43,609
How will I ever get away?

253
00:15:47,696 --> 00:15:48,614
Oh, no.

254
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:01,919
-This must be where they're keeping them.
-What do we do?

255
00:16:02,002 --> 00:16:02,878
We save them.

256
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:05,798
For the honor of Grayskull.

257
00:16:07,132 --> 00:16:08,092
[shouting]

258
00:16:22,564 --> 00:16:24,233
Awesome.

259
00:16:27,778 --> 00:16:31,073
Wait, this doesn't make sense.
The map said the pit would be here.

260
00:16:37,621 --> 00:16:40,416
-We'll handle this. Stay out of sight.
-Okay.

261
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:41,959
[grunting]

262
00:17:02,938 --> 00:17:06,316
-Oh, yeah, they regenerate.
-We forgot the bots regenerate.

263
00:17:09,445 --> 00:17:12,531
Ah. This isn't my first time
in a Horde cell.

264
00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:15,784
Luckily, they didn't search you
well enough.

265
00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:18,537
Can I borrow this?

266
00:17:25,252 --> 00:17:26,170
Yes.

267
00:17:29,965 --> 00:17:31,258
[Catra] Hey, Adora.

268
00:17:33,093 --> 00:17:34,928
Took you long enough to show.

269
00:17:35,804 --> 00:17:36,680
Catra.

270
00:17:36,764 --> 00:17:41,977
Seriously. I thought I'd have to kidnap
another town to get your attention.

271
00:17:42,436 --> 00:17:46,023
Oh, that's right, you were having a party.

272
00:17:46,106 --> 00:17:48,484
Must've thought you were pretty special.

273
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:52,071
Can we skip the speech?
I'm done playing your games, Catra.

274
00:17:52,154 --> 00:17:54,573
Too many people got hurt
when you set off that portal.

275
00:17:55,699 --> 00:17:57,159
I hope it was worth it.

276
00:17:57,242 --> 00:18:01,747
Because I won't let you hurt my friends
or anyone else ever again.

277
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:03,749
[laughing]

278
00:18:03,957 --> 00:18:07,002
You were the one who
left the villagers unprotected.

279
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:10,130
You're good enough at hurting your friends
without my help.

280
00:18:10,214 --> 00:18:12,883
But you're still terrible
at spotting traps.

281
00:18:14,134 --> 00:18:16,261
[gasps, then shouting]

282
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:20,015
Pretty good, huh?
I got the idea from Shadow Weaver.

283
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:22,434
At least she was good for something.

284
00:18:22,518 --> 00:18:25,604
If only your friends could see you now.

285
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:34,905
No guards? Weird.

286
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:39,201
All right, that's everyone.
Now let's get out of here.

287
00:18:40,661 --> 00:18:43,914
-Bow.
-Flutterina? What are you doing here?

288
00:18:43,997 --> 00:18:46,834
It's She-Ra.
She's in trouble and she needs help.

289
00:18:48,418 --> 00:18:49,461
[grunting]

290
00:18:52,339 --> 00:18:56,385
You know, Adora, your whole
self-righteous hero thing is getting old.

291
00:18:56,927 --> 00:18:59,888
At least I finally found a way
to shut you up. Ow!

292
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:01,974
Hey. Get away from She-Ra.

293
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:04,017
Adora.

294
00:19:05,269 --> 00:19:06,270
Aw.

295
00:19:06,395 --> 00:19:10,774
Looks like your friends came to watch.
Why don't we put on a show for them?

296
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:17,489
-We have to do something.
-Wait. Look.

297
00:19:40,387 --> 00:19:41,221
Swift Wind.

[crowd cheering]

303
00:20:21,929 --> 00:20:24,306
Three cheers for She-Ra.

304
00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:27,100
Thank you. We couldn't have
gotten out without you guys.

305
00:20:27,184 --> 00:20:30,604
Thank Flutterina.
It was her quick thinking that saved us.

306
00:20:30,687 --> 00:20:34,691
I know you think I'm just a kid,
but I'm ready to join the Rebellion.

307
00:20:34,775 --> 00:20:38,737
I wanna fight the Horde
and keep my people safe, like She-Ra.

308
00:20:39,446 --> 00:20:43,659
The Rebellion could use someone brave
and clever like you. We'd be honored.

309
00:20:45,369 --> 00:20:47,371
[Flutterina] Thank you. Thank you so much.

310
00:20:55,629 --> 00:20:57,339
Catra, there you are.

311
00:20:59,508 --> 00:21:02,552
Are you okay?
Don't worry about that Adora stuff.

312
00:21:02,636 --> 00:21:04,680
I'm here and there's nothing we can't fix,

313
00:21:04,763 --> 00:21:06,473
because that's what friends are for.

314
00:21:06,556 --> 00:21:08,475
I'm sure Hordak will understand.

315
00:21:08,558 --> 00:21:11,353
-Oh. If Entrapta was here maybe we could--
-Stop it.

316
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:16,441
Stop badgering me.
Stop hovering around me. Just back off.

317
00:21:16,817 --> 00:21:20,570
I don't need to explain myself to you.
We're not friends.

318
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:27,869
Oh, and Scorpia?

319
00:21:30,455 --> 00:21:33,834
Keep Emily out of my sight
or I'll sell her for scrap.

320
00:21:33,917 --> 00:21:34,751
Understand?

321
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:45,345
Sacred bond, saving the day.

322
00:21:45,429 --> 00:21:48,265
I'm joining the Rebellion.
Can you believe it?

323
00:21:48,348 --> 00:21:52,352
Me, Flutterina.
This is the most exciting day of my life.

324
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:55,981
You okay?

325
00:21:57,858 --> 00:22:02,279
Ugh. I put everyone in danger because
I thought I could handle everything.

326
00:22:02,904 --> 00:22:07,701
I was excited that everyone was treating
me like a hero, I forgot to act like one.

327
00:22:07,784 --> 00:22:11,830
Hey. Elberon's safe and we got
a new recruit for the Rebellion.

328
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:16,293
You're right.
I couldn't have done it without you.

329
00:22:16,585 --> 00:22:18,587
-Thanks, Bow.
-Anytime.

330
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:19,755
Now let's go home.

00:22:23,133 --> 00:22:24,134

[laughing]

334
00:22:27,888 --> 00:22:30,432
Like a charm. The plan is under way.
