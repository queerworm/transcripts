worked for will be destroyed.

178
00:14:05,594 --> 00:14:07,763
We're not in Despondos anymore.

179
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:11,350
We're in the wider universe.

180
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:14,186
I need to find Glimmer.

181
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:15,854
[grunting]

182
00:14:16,605 --> 00:14:17,690
Adora was right.

183
00:14:18,107 --> 00:14:19,942
Light Hope used me.

184
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:23,529
She activated the Heart.

185
00:14:23,612 --> 00:14:26,282
So? I thought you wanted to win.

186
00:14:26,574 --> 00:14:27,533
Use your weapon.

187
00:14:27,616 --> 00:14:28,659
I can't.

188
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:31,745
It would destroy everything.

189
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:35,082
I have to try and stop it.

190
00:14:57,396 --> 00:14:59,189
The Heart is primed and ready.

191
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,900
Commencing activation.

192
00:15:00,983 --> 00:15:02,526
[She-Ra shouting]

193
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:09,033
Look at all these stars, these worlds.

194
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:11,410
They will all be destroyed.

195
00:15:11,952 --> 00:15:15,247
Mara sacrificed her life
to stop this from happening.

196
00:15:15,539 --> 00:15:16,373
Mara.

197
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:18,375
Mara would not want me to--

198
00:15:18,834 --> 00:15:19,960
Mara was a traitor.

199
00:15:20,085 --> 00:15:21,879
She turned against her people.

200
00:15:21,962 --> 00:15:23,589
Mara was your friend.

201
00:15:24,715 --> 00:15:28,928
She knew you were more
than just a program, and so do I.

202
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:32,056
You can stop this.

203
00:15:32,514 --> 00:15:34,183
I am not as strong as Mara.

204
00:15:34,475 --> 00:15:36,352
I cannot change my programming.

205
00:15:36,435 --> 00:15:38,103
This is our destiny.

206
00:15:41,815 --> 00:15:42,900
No.

207
00:15:42,983 --> 00:15:45,194
This is not my destiny.

208
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:47,196
You will comply.

209
00:15:48,739 --> 00:15:50,240
No, no, no.

210
00:15:50,741 --> 00:15:52,284
[shouting]

211
00:16:24,358 --> 00:16:25,693
It is time.

212
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:28,946
I won't be controlled.

213
00:16:29,446 --> 00:16:31,615
I am not a piece of their machine.

214
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:33,742
I am not a weapon.

215
00:16:34,576 --> 00:16:37,955
And I'm going to end this now.

216
00:16:39,373 --> 00:16:40,624
No. Stop.

217
00:16:43,794 --> 00:16:45,004
Don't. Do it.

218
00:16:50,926 --> 00:16:51,760
Do it.

219
00:16:51,927 --> 00:16:52,761
Don't.

220
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:55,681
Don't.

221
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:02,521
Do it.

222
00:17:06,066 --> 00:17:07,192
[shouting]

223
00:17:20,622 --> 00:17:21,665
[grunting]

224
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:28,547
Adora?

225
00:17:32,801 --> 00:17:33,635
Thank you.

226
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:04,958
-Bow.
-Stay there, I'm coming.

227
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:14,093
Horde Prime, he's here.

228
00:18:16,512 --> 00:18:17,387
No.

229
00:18:43,372 --> 00:18:44,414
[grunting]

230
00:18:55,342 --> 00:18:57,719
[Horde Prime] Is that you, little brother?

231
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,642
I thought you had perished.

232
00:19:04,685 --> 00:19:06,895
I was pulled into a shadow dimension.

233
00:19:07,187 --> 00:19:10,440
All this time I have been trying
to return to your side.

234
00:19:10,524 --> 00:19:12,568
But it has not been in vain.

235
00:19:12,651 --> 00:19:16,572
I have built an empire in your name.

236
00:19:17,573 --> 00:19:22,327
I received your transmission,
but I could not determine its source.

237
00:19:22,911 --> 00:19:27,833
Until I detected an energy reading
like nothing I have ever seen before.

238
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:32,504
And when I arrived,
this curious planet had appeared.

239
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:35,716
I conquered this world for you.

240
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:40,637
To show you that I am worthy, so that
I may retake my place by your side.

241
00:19:41,054 --> 00:19:43,891
I have bent its people to my will.

242
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:48,228
To your will.

243
00:19:51,398 --> 00:19:53,734
Why can I not see your thoughts?

244
00:19:56,153 --> 00:19:57,154
I see now.

245
00:19:57,654 --> 00:19:59,781
You have given yourself a name.

246
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:02,451
You tried to create an empire of your own.

247
00:20:02,951 --> 00:20:07,623
There was even a time you wished
I would not come for you, is that so?

248
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:09,208
No, brother.

249
00:20:09,499 --> 00:20:12,461
I did it, all of it, for you.

250
00:20:17,132 --> 00:20:19,301
You have forgotten who you are.

251
00:20:19,635 --> 00:20:22,387
You truly think
you are worthy to stand beside me,

252
00:20:22,846 --> 00:20:24,306
could be equal to me?

253
00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:27,267
I made you in my image,

254
00:20:27,517 --> 00:20:29,686
but you have become an abomination.

255
00:20:29,811 --> 00:20:33,023
And so, you must be reborn.

256
00:20:33,857 --> 00:20:35,025
[shouts]

257
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:41,865
Take him to be reconditioned.

258
00:20:44,826 --> 00:20:47,037
But I have been rude.

259
00:20:47,329 --> 00:20:48,538
We have a guest.

260
00:20:48,622 --> 00:20:51,500
Royalty, unless I'm mistaken.

261
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:54,127
I apologize for my little brother.

262
00:20:54,211 --> 00:20:56,171
His actions are an embarrassment.

263
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:59,549
I desire only peace and order.

264
00:21:00,384 --> 00:21:02,302
Then you'll leave us alone?

265
00:21:04,054 --> 00:21:05,180
Oh, no, child.

266
00:21:05,722 --> 00:21:09,184
I cannot let words spread
of my brother's botched conquest.

267
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:13,981
For order to thrive,
this whole mess must be wiped away.

268
00:21:15,399 --> 00:21:16,817
Beginning with you.

269
00:21:17,859 --> 00:21:19,820
[Catra] I wouldn't do that if I were you.

270
00:21:21,613 --> 00:21:23,115
You don't wanna destroy Etheria.

271
00:21:23,198 --> 00:21:25,784
The whole planet
is some kind of ancient superweapon.

272
00:21:25,867 --> 00:21:28,829
A really, really big one.

273
00:21:28,912 --> 00:21:30,956
Sparkles, here, is a part of it.

274
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:34,001
And if you wanna learn how to use it,
you need me.

275
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:36,086
A weapon?

276
00:21:37,254 --> 00:21:39,423
That explains these readings.

277
00:21:39,923 --> 00:21:43,135
They are stronger than anything I've seen.

278
00:21:45,846 --> 00:21:50,309
Your Majesty, what an honor
to host a guest of your stature.

279
00:21:50,392 --> 00:21:55,480
Trust that your planet
will become the jewel of my empire,

280
00:21:55,939 --> 00:21:59,026
and it will allow me
to bring peace and order

281
00:21:59,109 --> 00:22:01,653
to the farthest reaches of the universe.

282
00:22:02,654 --> 00:22:04,865
Thank you for your allegiance, child.

283
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:10,871
All creatures, no matter how small,
have a place in service of Horde Prime.

284
00:22:20,088 --> 00:22:21,131
[Bow] Adora.

285
00:22:25,719 --> 00:22:27,888
They took her. They took Glimmer.

286
00:22:29,848 --> 00:22:30,807
She-Ra's gone.

287
00:22:31,475 --> 00:22:32,976
The Sword is broken.

288
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:34,770
So what are we gonna do?

289
00:22:35,687 --> 00:22:37,230
We're going to get Glimmer back...

290
00:22:37,981 --> 00:22:40,192
and we're going to save the universe.

291
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:43,737
[closing theme playing]
