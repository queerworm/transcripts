Boom, nets.

00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:54,637
Everyone, be ready.

8
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:57,807
Our scouts reported the Horde
is transporting a new prototype weapon.

9
00:00:57,891 --> 00:01:01,352
They wouldn't brave the Whispering Woods
unless it was something powerful.

10
00:01:01,436 --> 00:01:05,857
If I know Entrapta, this thing
is gonna be big, unpredictable and...

11
00:01:07,525 --> 00:01:08,860
invisible.

12
00:01:08,943 --> 00:01:10,070
Genius.

13
00:01:13,782 --> 00:01:15,867
Or it's just empty.

14
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:18,787
But our scouts said Catra
would be moving the weapon today.

15
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:20,371
It's supposed to be here.

[robots approaching]

17
00:01:27,462 --> 00:01:28,463
It's an ambush.

I don't understand how this happened.

29
00:02:05,583 --> 00:02:08,670
The Horde must have figured out
we were going after the transport

30
00:02:08,753 --> 00:02:10,338
and laid a trap.

31
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:14,092
Ooh.

32
00:02:15,093 --> 00:02:16,010
Uh--

33
00:02:16,427 --> 00:02:17,762
Are you all okay?

34
00:02:17,846 --> 00:02:19,472
Never been better.

[both shout]

36
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:24,060
Okay, we've been slightly better.

37
00:02:25,228 --> 00:02:28,481
How do they keep doing this?
No matter where I send you,

38
00:02:28,565 --> 00:02:31,401
the Horde always shows up
to ruin the mission.

39
00:02:31,484 --> 00:02:33,528
And I'm just sitting here, I--

40
00:02:33,611 --> 00:02:36,781
It's okay, Glimmer. Everyone knows
you're needed in Bright Moon.

41
00:02:36,865 --> 00:02:38,700
So, what's the plan now?

42
00:02:38,783 --> 00:02:41,286
Did someone say Swift Wind?

43
00:02:42,912 --> 00:02:44,289
Swift-- Hang on.

44
00:02:45,498 --> 00:02:48,042
-Did someone say--?
-No one said Swift Wind.

45
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:52,964
But you just did. Anyway, I backtracked
down the path the transport was on.

46
00:02:53,047 --> 00:02:55,717
It came from the mountains,
on the far side of Bright Moon.

47
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:59,470
That could be where they're keeping
the weapon. We have to investigate.

48
00:02:59,554 --> 00:03:02,181
A smaller team will avoid detection.

49
00:03:02,265 --> 00:03:04,809
Get in and out
before the Horde even knows you're there.

50
00:03:04,893 --> 00:03:07,228
I hate sending you guys back out.

51
00:03:07,312 --> 00:03:11,733
Whatever this is, we need to destroy it
before it's used on innocent people.

52
00:03:11,816 --> 00:03:13,735
-Right, guys?
-Count us in.

53
00:03:13,818 --> 00:03:15,069
Darling, your arm.

54
00:03:15,153 --> 00:03:16,779
Uh-huh? Nice try.

55
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:20,241
Spinnerella refuses to accept
that I busted two more bots than she did,

56
00:03:20,325 --> 00:03:21,284
so I'm winning.

57
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:23,453
-There is nothing to win--
-[clearing throat]

58
00:03:23,536 --> 00:03:27,081
So, uh, hey, how about we take
this conversation to the War Room?

59
00:03:27,165 --> 00:03:29,918
-We've got a mission to plan.
-Great. Let's go.

00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:34,380
[groans]

61
00:03:34,839 --> 00:03:36,507
Oh, sorry, Your Majesty.

62
00:03:36,591 --> 00:03:38,718
Sorry, Flutterina, I didn't see you.

63
00:03:38,801 --> 00:03:40,303
Oh, it's okay.

64
00:03:40,386 --> 00:03:43,431
Are you guys going on a mission?
Can I come?

65
00:03:43,514 --> 00:03:47,810
Not this time.
And not all of us are going.

66
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:48,978
Next time, then.

67
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:51,397
Rebellion Soldier Flutterina is ready.

68
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:52,315
Have fun.

69
00:04:09,832 --> 00:04:13,711
I can't get over
how ridiculous you look, "Flutterina."

70
00:04:13,795 --> 00:04:16,673
Right? I said to myself, "Double Trouble,

71
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:19,300
what sort of character
would the Princesses trust?"

72
00:04:19,384 --> 00:04:22,929
Someone tooth-achingly cute and pink.

73
00:04:27,392 --> 00:04:30,853
Then it came to me, Flutterina.
A role for the--

74
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:33,106
Yeah, great, whatever. Is there any news?

75
00:04:33,189 --> 00:04:35,233
Your team did quite a number
on the Rebels.

76
00:04:35,316 --> 00:04:40,238
They came limping back in,
so despondent, such emotion.

77
00:04:40,321 --> 00:04:42,407
Oh! It was breathtaking.

78
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:45,410
Your intel was good,
but they still got away.

79
00:04:46,661 --> 00:04:49,163
Espionage is a long game, kitten.

80
00:04:49,247 --> 00:04:52,041
The Rebels are tired, demoralized.

81
00:04:52,667 --> 00:04:53,626
[laughing]

82
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:55,962
And you should've seen Glimmer's face

83
00:04:56,045 --> 00:04:59,590
when she realized
she'd been outsmarted again.

84
00:04:59,674 --> 00:05:03,303
How is the Horde always two steps ahead?

85
00:05:03,386 --> 00:05:05,805
Angry sparkle, growl.

86
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:09,142
And any intel on She-Ra?
Or are we done here?

87
00:05:09,225 --> 00:05:11,311
So serious.

88
00:05:11,394 --> 00:05:14,230
Remember, this is supposed to be fun.

89
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:16,441
This is supposed to be war.

90
00:05:16,524 --> 00:05:18,151
No reason it can't be both.

91
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:19,444
[grunts]

92
00:05:20,695 --> 00:05:23,573
All business, no fun.

93
00:05:23,656 --> 00:05:27,201
She-Ra's putting together a team
to track down Hordak's new weapon.

94
00:05:27,285 --> 00:05:29,871
She-Ra's not going to find anything.

95
00:05:29,954 --> 00:05:33,249
But they'll all see the weapon
when the time comes.

96
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:34,417
Ooh.

97
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,169
Foreshadowing.

98
00:05:36,252 --> 00:05:37,837
Love this.

99
00:05:43,468 --> 00:05:44,510

102
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:09,535
-[Shadow Weaver] Impressive.
-Huh?

103
00:06:11,329 --> 00:06:12,663
What are you doing here?

104
00:06:13,289 --> 00:06:15,416
I've come to tend my garden.

105
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:19,253
You've got to be kidding me.
You're gardening?

106
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:21,214
You?

107
00:06:21,297 --> 00:06:23,925
One must keep oneself occupied.

108
00:06:25,468 --> 00:06:28,638
Your power is truly a sight to behold.

109
00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:31,933
It's no wonder,
you being Micah's daughter.

110
00:06:32,016 --> 00:06:35,019
I'd never seen a sorcerer like him.

111
00:06:35,103 --> 00:06:35,937
I get it.

112
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:38,898
I'm the daughter of an angelic being
and a powerful sorcerer,

113
00:06:38,981 --> 00:06:41,317
and I'll never be as good
as either of them.

114
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,610
That's true.

115
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:44,862
You'll be better.

116
00:06:45,696 --> 00:06:47,532
[Shadow Weaver chuckling]

117
00:06:47,615 --> 00:06:50,952
Don't you remember your raw magical energy

118
00:06:51,035 --> 00:06:53,955
when we invaded the Fright Zone together?

119
00:06:54,038 --> 00:06:55,540
I remember you draining me.

120
00:06:55,623 --> 00:06:57,083
[Shadow Weaver] Yes.

121
00:06:57,166 --> 00:07:00,211
But I did help you become more powerful.

122
00:07:00,294 --> 00:07:04,006
Well, luckily, I don't need your help
for that anymore.

123
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:06,467
No, I suppose not.

124
00:07:06,551 --> 00:07:10,972
Of course, it's all wasted
if you don't use it.

125
00:07:12,682 --> 00:07:14,183
I've been watching you.

126
00:07:15,059 --> 00:07:19,147
You're trying to be like your mother,
overseeing things from afar.

127
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:20,898
But you are not her.

128
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:24,694
You must decide for yourself

129
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:29,282
what kind of queen you will be.

130
00:07:29,824 --> 00:07:31,284
And I've decided.

131
00:07:31,909 --> 00:07:35,121
I'm a queen who doesn't take advice
from prisoners.

132
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:40,460
[Swift Wind neighing]

133
00:07:46,424 --> 00:07:48,468
Stay close, and stay quiet.

134
00:07:54,265 --> 00:07:56,893
Just for the record,
I'm being way quieter than you--

135
00:07:56,976 --> 00:07:59,187
Guys, do you hear something?

136
00:08:03,524 --> 00:08:04,400
[gasps]

137
00:08:09,447 --> 00:08:11,282
It's an ambush. Again.

138
00:08:11,365 --> 00:08:12,575
This one's mine.

139
00:08:18,289 --> 00:08:20,041
Ha! Two for one.

140
00:08:20,124 --> 00:08:21,334
Still winning.

141
00:08:21,417 --> 00:08:22,543
[laughs then gasps]

142
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:32,512
Is...

143
00:08:32,595 --> 00:08:33,679
Is that the new weapon?

144
00:08:34,722 --> 00:08:37,141
It's not very big.

145
00:08:37,225 --> 00:08:38,434
Or move-y.

146
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:45,858
It could be a surveillance bot.

147
00:08:47,276 --> 00:08:49,320
[gasps, then shouting]

148
00:08:51,739 --> 00:08:52,823
[all shouting]

149
00:08:57,203 --> 00:08:58,538
[panting]

150
00:09:12,677 --> 00:09:13,511
[She-Ra] Bow?

151
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:17,265
Bow!

152
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:26,566
[sighs]

153
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:44,875
[groaning]

154
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:47,878
-[Bow] Did we win?
-Bow.

155
00:09:47,962 --> 00:09:50,256
Thank goodness. I was so scared.

156
00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:53,050
I feel like we didn't win.

157
00:09:53,134 --> 00:09:54,552
Bow, are you okay?

158
00:09:54,635 --> 00:09:56,512
Don't worry about me.

159
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:58,347
I'm fine.

160
00:09:58,431 --> 00:10:01,392
I'm just, you know,
gonna lie here for a bit.

161
00:10:01,892 --> 00:10:02,727
[grunts]

162
00:10:04,228 --> 00:10:05,646
Why is he not okay?

163
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:06,939
Even with healing,

164
00:10:07,023 --> 00:10:09,066
he's still going to need some time
to recover.

165
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:12,069
I can't keep sending my friends
into ambushes.

166
00:10:12,153 --> 00:10:13,988
How does the Horde know our every move?

167
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:17,658
I'm sorry, Your Majesty.
I hate to suggest it,

168
00:10:17,742 --> 00:10:19,785
but could they be tracking She-Ra?

169
00:10:20,578 --> 00:10:23,039
That could explain
how they always know where you are.

170
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:26,000
Bow...

171
00:10:27,335 --> 00:10:30,296
I'm sorry. It's my fault you got hurt.

172
00:10:30,379 --> 00:10:31,422
[Glimmer] No.

173
00:10:31,505 --> 00:10:33,132
This is Catra's fault.

174
00:10:33,215 --> 00:10:35,801
Her, and her bots, and--

175
00:10:36,385 --> 00:10:37,219
And me.

176
00:10:37,928 --> 00:10:40,765
I sent you out, knowing it was dangerous,

177
00:10:40,848 --> 00:10:44,435
while I stayed here, safe and sound.

178
00:10:44,518 --> 00:10:47,772
Don't worry about me.
I'm the one who worries about you.

179
00:10:47,855 --> 00:10:49,357
Can we go back to that? Please?

180
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,526
I'm going back
to find that bot and destroy it.

181
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:56,572
No. If the Horde is tracking you,
they're gonna be ready. What if--?

182
00:10:56,656 --> 00:11:00,451
Glimmer, you said it yourself.
We can't risk more people getting hurt.

183
00:11:00,534 --> 00:11:01,369
General?

184
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:04,080
[groaning]

185
00:11:04,997 --> 00:11:07,875
Don't worry, Bow.
I'm gonna take care of this.

186
00:11:15,883 --> 00:11:18,719
<i>Catra. I knew you were behind this.</i>

187
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:22,807
-Ugh.
-Oh, no, the new weapon! It's firing.

188
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:24,058
[shouting]

189
00:11:24,141 --> 00:11:26,477
It got me in the abs.

190
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:29,438
The most vulnerable part of the body
that I refuse to cover,

191
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:31,440
because I don't own real shirts.

192
00:11:32,066 --> 00:11:32,900
[groaning]

193
00:11:33,275 --> 00:11:36,862
[crying]
If only I was there to sparkle at it.

194
00:11:37,696 --> 00:11:39,657
Oh, Bow!

195
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:40,991
Glimmer!

196
00:11:41,075 --> 00:11:42,952
She-Ra! [blows raspberry]

197
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:44,412
[laughing]

198
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:46,705
Show me She-Ra again.

199
00:11:46,789 --> 00:11:49,041
[She-Ra] <i>I'm She-Ra. </i>[blows raspberry]

200
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:50,334
[laughing]

201
00:11:51,001 --> 00:11:51,919
Ah.

202
00:11:52,294 --> 00:11:53,629
There it is.

203
00:11:53,712 --> 00:11:54,880
<i>There what is?</i>

204
00:11:54,964 --> 00:11:58,259
The thrill
of seeding destruction and chaos.

205
00:11:58,926 --> 00:12:02,430
Ahem. I'll be thrilled if the Pulsebot
really blew that dummy up.

206
00:12:02,513 --> 00:12:05,599
Sadly, Bow's been healed
by some glowy magic.

207
00:12:05,683 --> 00:12:07,726
-Very dramatic stuff.
-[growls]

208
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:09,270
Oh, cheer up.

209
00:12:09,353 --> 00:12:12,022
I'm sending coordinates
for She-Ra's position.

210
00:12:12,106 --> 00:12:15,901
She's going back out to destroy the bot
that hurt her friend.

211
00:12:15,985 --> 00:12:19,071
Ugh. Typical heroic Adora plan.

212
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:21,365
Too bad we'll be gone
by the time she gets there.

213
00:12:22,324 --> 00:12:27,163
But if it's to take down She-Ra,
I think we could stand a delay.

214
00:12:27,913 --> 00:12:30,916
<i>I knew there was a reason I liked you.</i>

215
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,334
<i>Having fun yet?</i>

216
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,712
You know, I think I am.

217
00:12:35,713 --> 00:12:37,173
[Shadow Weaver humming]

218
00:12:39,717 --> 00:12:41,010
Give us a minute.

219
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:43,137
That's an order.

220
00:12:47,641 --> 00:12:48,476
I need--

221
00:12:49,477 --> 00:12:51,353
The Queen demands your help.

222
00:12:51,979 --> 00:12:53,314
[Shadow Weaver] I see.

223
00:12:53,481 --> 00:12:55,566
And what is it I can do?

224
00:12:56,108 --> 00:12:57,526
You know Catra best.

225
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:00,154
She's been two steps ahead
this entire time.

226
00:13:00,237 --> 00:13:02,615
Show me how to think like she does,

227
00:13:02,698 --> 00:13:06,035
so I can figure out her next move
before anyone else gets hurt.

228
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:11,415
[Shadow Weaver]
You don't need to think like Catra.

229
00:13:11,499 --> 00:13:13,959
I told you you're more powerful
than you know.

230
00:13:14,502 --> 00:13:18,047
Are you willing to use your power?

231
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:23,844
And how, hypothetically, would I do that?

232
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:26,096
Magic, of course.

233
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:31,977
A location spell is a simple
but powerful tool for any young sorcerer.

234
00:13:32,061 --> 00:13:35,898
All it takes is a few ingredients...

235
00:13:36,982 --> 00:13:39,360
and the will to see it through.

236
00:13:43,113 --> 00:13:46,033
You've been growing magic plants
this whole time?

237
00:13:47,409 --> 00:13:48,327
What do these do?

238
00:13:49,828 --> 00:13:52,915
[Shadow Weaver]
Those are daisies. I find them cheerful.

239
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:58,212
Now, the final ingredient,
added by the spellcaster.

240
00:14:05,427 --> 00:14:06,720
Did I do that?

241
00:14:12,226 --> 00:14:13,185
[gasps]

242
00:14:14,311 --> 00:14:16,438
Think about what you're searching for.

243
00:14:17,064 --> 00:14:18,899
Keep it in your mind.

244
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:27,491
[Glimmer] A secret outpost.
The Horde has been operating

245
00:14:27,575 --> 00:14:30,411
out of the Whispering Woods
this whole time.

246
00:14:31,161 --> 00:14:32,329
Well done.

247
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:34,331
Oh, no.

248
00:14:34,415 --> 00:14:36,500
Adora's looking in the wrong place.

249
00:14:36,584 --> 00:14:38,377
If we can warn her in time,

250
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:42,172
we can send her to the outpost
and stop Catra once and for all.

251
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:45,050
But if Catra's tracking She-Ra,

252
00:14:45,134 --> 00:14:48,053
she'll know we're coming
and clear out before we get there.

253
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:53,225
Catra won't be expecting an attack.
Her attention will be focused on Adora.

254
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:55,853
It would be the perfect time to strike.

255
00:14:56,937 --> 00:14:59,398
Are you suggesting I use Adora as bait?

256
00:14:59,481 --> 00:15:01,442
[Shadow Weaver] As a distraction.

257
00:15:01,525 --> 00:15:04,737
But the decision is yours alone to make.

258
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:08,616
What will you do, Your Majesty?

259
00:15:18,292 --> 00:15:19,919
I don't see any sign of the Horde.

260
00:15:20,002 --> 00:15:21,503
I can take it from here.

261
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:24,214
I'm not leaving until I destroy this bot.

262
00:15:24,298 --> 00:15:27,217
No. Princesses stick together.
We'll find it.

263
00:15:27,343 --> 00:15:32,097
Ha. You wanna fight some bots. See, Adora?
She is just as competitive as I am.

264
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:34,934
See, this is why no one comes
to game night anymore.

265
00:15:35,017 --> 00:15:36,185
Adora, tell her.

266
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:39,647
-Oh, I don't--
-Maybe people don't come to game night

267
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:42,650
because you insist
on serving vegetable platters.

268
00:15:42,733 --> 00:15:45,486
No one likes vegetable platters.
Right, Adora?

269
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:49,949
[robot powering up]

270
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:57,247
Fall back!

271
00:16:01,126 --> 00:16:02,670
[panting]

272
00:16:03,754 --> 00:16:05,172
[robots powering up]

273
00:16:26,443 --> 00:16:27,820
[soldiers shouting]

274
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:35,327
-What are you doing back--?
-[shouts]

275
00:16:37,913 --> 00:16:38,998
It's you.

276
00:16:39,081 --> 00:16:40,332
Who else would it be?

277
00:16:50,926 --> 00:16:53,887
Didn't anyone ever teach you
to put away your toys?

278
00:16:53,971 --> 00:16:56,598
Otherwise, someone might come
and break them.

279
00:16:57,224 --> 00:16:58,684
You think I don't have more?

280
00:16:58,767 --> 00:17:03,105
I think most of your bots are busy
with She-Ra, leaving you defenseless.

281
00:17:03,731 --> 00:17:05,858
Using your own friend as a decoy?

282
00:17:05,941 --> 00:17:08,110
Wow, didn't know you had it in you.

283
00:17:08,193 --> 00:17:09,778
Guess you don't know everything.

284
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:11,572
[grunting and shouting]

285
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:38,223
You even taste like glitter.

286
00:17:47,149 --> 00:17:48,859
Where you going, Catra?

287
00:17:48,942 --> 00:17:51,320
Not scared of some sparkles, are you?

288
00:17:51,945 --> 00:17:54,156
The Pulsebots
are out vaporizing your friends,

289
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:56,325
but I bet you'd like to see our upgrade.

290
00:17:57,951 --> 00:18:01,997
We were saving it
for a special occasion, but this'll do.

291
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:03,082
[gasps]

292
00:18:12,966 --> 00:18:15,135
You're gonna bring the whole place down.

293
00:18:15,219 --> 00:18:18,222
Don't worry.
I'm not planning to stick around.

294
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:23,894
It's revving up to send out a pulse
strong enough to level half the woods.

295
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:28,065
So you'd better choose. Me, or the bot?

296
00:18:38,575 --> 00:18:39,493
[shouts]

297
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:43,872
Looks like I don't have to.

298
00:18:45,332 --> 00:18:46,917
[powering up]

299
00:19:03,684 --> 00:19:04,935
[grunting]

300
00:19:05,894 --> 00:19:09,773
Word around Bright Moon was that the Queen
had disappeared on a mission.

301
00:19:09,857 --> 00:19:11,900
I thought I'd come check on you.

302
00:19:12,526 --> 00:19:14,862
Double Trouble. About time.

303
00:19:15,737 --> 00:19:17,281
[grunting]

304
00:19:32,212 --> 00:19:35,799
I don't know how long I can do this.

305
00:19:36,758 --> 00:19:38,010
Glimmer?

306
00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:40,179
Thought you could use some help.

307
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:52,816
Whoa.

308
00:19:53,233 --> 00:19:54,651
-[gasps]
-[robot powering up]

309
00:19:59,406 --> 00:20:00,407
[shouting]

310
00:20:06,747 --> 00:20:07,748
Spinnerella!

311
00:20:08,373 --> 00:20:10,375
Spinnerella, please, talk to me.

312
00:20:11,793 --> 00:20:12,628
Fourteen.

313
00:20:14,004 --> 00:20:14,838
What?

314
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:18,717
That was 14 bots for me.

315
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:19,635
I win.

316
00:20:21,011 --> 00:20:21,887
[chuckles]

317
00:20:22,137 --> 00:20:24,348
That's my girl. You win.

318
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:28,685
Should I start counting too? Because...

319
00:20:30,187 --> 00:20:31,104
I got the rest.

320
00:20:33,106 --> 00:20:36,068
You should've seen me out there, Bow.
I was like...

321
00:20:36,151 --> 00:20:37,361
[shouting]

322
00:20:39,029 --> 00:20:43,158
Sounds really cool.
But also, really awful?

323
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:47,746
Ugh. Come on, guys.
Can't we just enjoy this victory?

324
00:20:47,829 --> 00:20:51,750
This isn't over. We need to figure out
how the Horde is tracking me.

325
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:55,170
But until we do,
at least we can use it to our advantage.

326
00:20:55,796 --> 00:20:57,089
By using me as a decoy?

327
00:20:57,923 --> 00:20:59,675
I know it was dangerous.

328
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:02,678
But it was the only chance I had
to take out the rest of the bots

329
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:04,846
before Catra could unleash them.

330
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:05,889
And it worked.

331
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:09,601
I'm not gonna stay behind anymore.

332
00:21:09,685 --> 00:21:11,937
That's not the kind of queen I am.

333
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:15,607
I wanna be out there,
fighting to protect my kingdom.

334
00:21:16,233 --> 00:21:18,652
Side by side with my best friends.

335
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:22,239
And now that Shadow Weaver's
teaching me magic,

336
00:21:22,322 --> 00:21:24,032
I'll be twice as effective.

337
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:25,742
What? Shadow Weaver's teaching you?

338
00:21:25,826 --> 00:21:29,579
Guys. We won today,
and no one else got hurt.

339
00:21:29,663 --> 00:21:31,665
-That's what counts.
-Glimmer, I don't know--

340
00:21:31,748 --> 00:21:34,001
Now, I'm gonna go raid the kitchen
in celebration.

341
00:21:34,084 --> 00:21:35,752
-Glimmer.
-I'll bring back some cake.

342
00:21:39,423 --> 00:21:41,341
[Double Trouble] Here's your stop, kitten.

343
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:44,886
What are you going to tell your boss
about all his shiny new bots

344
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:46,054
getting blown up?

345
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:49,141
I'm going to say,
"You're welcome for testing them

346
00:21:49,224 --> 00:21:51,977
before we moved ahead with our big plan.

347
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:53,395
Obviously they were garbage."

348
00:21:54,646 --> 00:21:59,109
Hey, thank you, by the way for saving me.

349
00:21:59,735 --> 00:22:02,487
I don't know what I would've done
if you hadn't shown up.

350
00:22:02,571 --> 00:22:04,489
Well, I live to serve.

351
00:22:05,365 --> 00:22:07,326
For a price, of course.

352
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:14,624
Marvelous. And don't worry, darling,
I'll keep a better eye on Glimmer.

353
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:16,585
Who knew she was so powerful?

354
00:22:16,668 --> 00:22:19,838
Heh. Whatever.
If she hadn't used Adora as bait.

355
00:22:19,921 --> 00:22:22,549
Oh, yes. How devious.

356
00:22:22,632 --> 00:22:25,635
I'd assumed she was all glitter, no grit.

357
00:22:25,719 --> 00:22:28,305
Yeah, that was unexpected.

358
00:22:29,056 --> 00:22:31,099
And then she showed up alone.

359
00:22:32,267 --> 00:22:35,771
Huh. Looks like the friendship
might have a few cracks, huh?

360
00:22:35,854 --> 00:22:38,982
Would be a shame if someone were there
to take advantage of them.

361
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:43,737
