00:00:25,025 --> 00:00:27,694
{\an8}Will you stop messing around
back there, Kyle?

4
00:00:28,194 --> 00:00:30,029
{\an8}We're almost out of these creepy woods.

00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:39,080
[She-Ra shouts]

[chuckles]

9
00:00:56,055 --> 00:00:57,265
This is kind of fun.

10
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:02,145
You are not taking
your training seriously.

11
00:01:02,228 --> 00:01:03,980
What? Me?

12
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:05,857
That doesn't sound like me.

13
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:06,816
Adora.

14
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:10,403
Ugh. Come on, Light Hope. It's not
like I'm learning anything new here.

15
00:01:10,487 --> 00:01:12,906
Then I must offer
more hands-on instruction.

16
00:01:12,989 --> 00:01:14,616
There is a bot behind--

17
00:01:20,997 --> 00:01:22,165
Am I done now?

18
00:01:22,999 --> 00:01:25,710
I sense resistance.

19
00:01:25,794 --> 00:01:28,671
Because this is useless.
I don't need more training.

20
00:01:28,755 --> 00:01:29,964
I need answers.

21
00:01:30,048 --> 00:01:34,385
We're fighting a war, and the Horde
has been one step ahead at every turn.

22
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:36,805
Glimmer thinks
that they're tracking She-Ra somehow.

23
00:01:36,888 --> 00:01:38,932
Is it because my sword is First Ones tech?

24
00:01:39,015 --> 00:01:41,559
Or because I'm a First One?
And what does that even mean?

25
00:01:41,643 --> 00:01:44,854
Who were they? When we found
Mara's ship, she left a recording behind--

26
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:45,897
Adora.

27
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:47,732
Mara was compromised.

28
00:01:47,816 --> 00:01:49,150
She became unhinged.

29
00:01:49,234 --> 00:01:50,735
She didn't seem unhinged.

30
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:51,945
She seemed scared.

31
00:01:52,028 --> 00:01:53,738
And she was talking about a weapon.

32
00:01:53,822 --> 00:01:57,534
If there's something that can protect us
from the Horde, I need to know about it.

33
00:01:57,617 --> 00:02:00,995
Once you balance the planet,
all will be clear.

34
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:02,956
It is your purpose as She--

35
00:02:03,039 --> 00:02:05,583
She-- She-- She-- She--

36
00:02:05,667 --> 00:02:08,586
-She-- She-- She-- She--
-Oh, wow.

37
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:11,005
Really? Way to avoid the subject.

38
00:02:14,092 --> 00:02:15,635
Catra better appreciate us

39
00:02:15,718 --> 00:02:18,638
going behind enemy lines
to get this armor plating stuff for her.

That is not the Sword of Protection's
intended purpose.

55
00:03:10,648 --> 00:03:14,736
[sighs] Yeah, well, if you're not gonna
tell me anything, I'm leaving. [grunting]

00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:15,987
You cannot leave.

57
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:18,656
My sensors have detected

59
00:03:20,491 --> 00:03:22,076
It is not safe outside.

60
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:24,412
Well, that's convenient.

61
00:03:24,495 --> 00:03:28,458
You want me to stay here, so you can
not answer more of my questions?

-Adora.

00:03:38,259 --> 00:03:40,386
Hello, my name is Light Hope.

66
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:41,804
How may I assist you?

67
00:03:42,513 --> 00:03:43,681
What's going on?

68
00:03:43,765 --> 00:03:45,600
My system is rebooting.

69
00:03:45,683 --> 00:03:50,438
I would like to answer your query,
but the information as to what is going on

00:03:57,028 --> 00:03:59,530
We shouldn't have come
through the Whispering Woods.

74
00:03:59,614 --> 00:04:00,531
It's not safe.

75
00:04:00,615 --> 00:04:05,328
Well, obviously Catra felt it was worth
risking us to get this cargo back sooner.

76
00:04:05,828 --> 00:04:06,746
[shouts]

77
00:04:06,955 --> 00:04:08,039
It's attacking!

78
00:04:08,122 --> 00:04:09,791
Stand back. I'll handle it.

79
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:12,293

It's hurting! I made a mistake!

Will you quit it, Kyle? [grunts]

00:04:31,688 --> 00:04:32,522
[roars]

90
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:34,274
Why didn't you say it hurts?

[roaring]

92
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:46,911
I know, Rogelio.

93
00:04:46,995 --> 00:04:50,373
One of us has gotta go back outside
and fix the transport.

94
00:04:50,665 --> 00:04:51,541
Uh, uh...

95
00:04:51,624 --> 00:04:53,418
But outside hurts.

96
00:04:53,501 --> 00:04:57,338
Then we'll just have to stay in here
and wait out whatever is happening.

97
00:04:57,422 --> 00:04:59,424
What? We'll be trapped here?

98
00:04:59,507 --> 00:05:02,885
Maybe for hours or days?
With only each other for company?

99
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:05,972
And we won't be able to get back
to the Fright Zone?

100
00:05:06,681 --> 00:05:08,057
This is great.

101
00:05:08,766 --> 00:05:09,851
[both groan]

102
00:05:09,934 --> 00:05:13,062
Seriously. The Fright Zone's been
so stressful lately.

103
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:16,357
Out here we don't have to worry
about Catra showing up and yelling at--

104
00:05:16,441 --> 00:05:19,694
<i>Where are you?</i>
<i>You were supposed to be back an hour ago.</i>

105
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:21,404
Uh... Uh...

106
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:24,824
Well, the woods are attacking us
with very painful snow.

107
00:05:26,075 --> 00:05:27,493
<i>Why is he talking?</i>

108
00:05:27,577 --> 00:05:30,288
There's some weird acid storm out there.

109
00:05:30,371 --> 00:05:32,957
-But we're assessing the situation.
<i>-Assess faster.</i>

110
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:36,586
<i>Hordak needs that armor plating</i>
<i>from the rebel mine, now.</i>

111
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:38,546
<i>The plan can't fall behind schedule.</i>

112
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:42,300
Maybe if you told us
what this big plan is, we could help you--

113
00:05:42,383 --> 00:05:46,345
<i>I doubt that, seeing how you failed</i>
<i>to do the one thing I asked.</i>

114
00:05:46,429 --> 00:05:48,097
Hey. It's not our fault.

115
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:51,100
The transport broke down,
and it's too dangerous to go out there.

116
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:53,644
<i>I don't care! I gave you an order.</i>

117
00:05:53,728 --> 00:05:56,272
<i>Pick someone,</i>
<i>send them outside, and fix it.</i>

118
00:05:56,355 --> 00:05:57,190
<i>Now.</i>

00:05:58,816 --> 00:05:59,650
[sighs]

120
00:05:59,901 --> 00:06:00,735
<i>Understand?</i>

121
00:06:03,613 --> 00:06:04,447
<i>Well?</i>

122
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:09,452
Yes, Force Captain Catra.

00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:12,121
[groans]

124
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:13,039

00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:18,586

128
00:06:20,004 --> 00:06:23,257
The Light Hope operating system
is attempting to reload.

129
00:06:23,341 --> 00:06:24,342
Please stand by.

00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:30,098
I am pleased to report
that my system is now at 22 percent.

how to move about the castle.

[shouts]

133
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:38,940
[chuckles] Okay there.

134
00:06:39,023 --> 00:06:40,942
You seem like you're having fun.

135
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:42,485
Uh...

136
00:06:42,735 --> 00:06:43,694
Light Hope?

137
00:06:43,778 --> 00:06:46,697

00:06:46,781 --> 00:06:48,991
Am I not usually fun?

139
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:53,162
Oh, no. No, no.
I've never seen you like this.

140
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:55,873
I have also never seen you like this.

141
00:06:56,415 --> 00:06:59,752
Because your identity has not yet loaded.
Who are you?

142
00:07:00,336 --> 00:07:01,671
Adora.

143
00:07:01,754 --> 00:07:02,964
But I'm, you know...

144
00:07:03,714 --> 00:07:05,216
[whooshing]

145
00:07:05,758 --> 00:07:06,592
She-Ra.

146
00:07:08,177 --> 00:07:12,473
My primary purpose is to train She-Ra.
How may I assist you?

147
00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:17,395
Well, just before rebooting,

148
00:07:17,478 --> 00:07:20,982
you were gonna tell me
all about this weapon Mara mentioned,

149
00:07:21,065 --> 00:07:22,483
and about where I come from,

150
00:07:22,567 --> 00:07:25,528
and about everything
I've ever wanted to know.

151
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:29,282
Of course.
I will answer all of your questions.

152
00:07:29,991 --> 00:07:31,951
But that information has not yet loaded.

153
00:07:32,827 --> 00:07:34,370
I did, however, just learn

154
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:36,539
how to control gravity
in the Crystal Castle.

155
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:37,457
[shouting]

156
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:41,210
That is not right.

157
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:43,337
Do not worry, I will fix it.

158
00:07:43,421 --> 00:07:44,255
No, no, no.

159
00:07:44,338 --> 00:07:45,715
[shouting]

160
00:07:46,382 --> 00:07:48,050
[Lonnie] Okay, here's the situation.

161
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:53,055
One of us has to brave the acid snow,
go out there, and fix the transport.

162
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:56,684
So we're gonna choose
who goes outside fair and square...

163
00:07:57,351 --> 00:07:59,729
with a game of bot-shield-laser.

164
00:08:00,521 --> 00:08:02,815
Wait, how come you get to decide
what game we play?

165
00:08:05,109 --> 00:08:06,569
Because I'm clearly the leader.

166
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:07,695
[roaring]

167
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:12,575
See? Rogelio agrees.

168
00:08:12,658 --> 00:08:13,701
[roaring]

169
00:08:14,785 --> 00:08:17,079
Oh, pipe down. We go on three.

170
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:22,835
One, two, three.

171
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:26,756
[groans] Let's try that again.

172
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:29,133
One, two, three.

173
00:08:29,217 --> 00:08:30,218
[shouting]

174
00:08:31,719 --> 00:08:32,887
Apologies.

175
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:34,889
You appear to be in pain.

176
00:08:34,972 --> 00:08:36,974
Should I adjust the gravity again?

177
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:40,937
No. Has your system loaded anything
about Mara's weapon yet?

178
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:42,438
Or, you know, anything useful?

179
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:47,026
Are spiders useful? Because I have
just learned how to make spiders.

180
00:08:48,611 --> 00:08:51,489
No, they're not. Get rid of them, please.

181
00:08:52,657 --> 00:08:53,741
[grunting]

182
00:08:54,742 --> 00:08:57,995
I am so sorry,
but that information has not yet loaded.

183
00:08:59,163 --> 00:09:00,289
[groans]

184
00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:03,084
For the honor of Grayskull!

185
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:08,297
[shouts]

186
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:10,716
[Kyle] Yes!

187
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:15,721
[chuckles] Shield beats bot. Uh, but,
Lonnie, your laser beats shield, so...

188
00:09:16,347 --> 00:09:18,224
-So you win?
-[laughs]

189
00:09:19,016 --> 00:09:21,477
Except Rogelio's bot beat laser...

190
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:25,940
Okay, so I beat Rogelio,
but you beat me, and Rogelio beat you.

191
00:09:26,023 --> 00:09:27,108
That means...

192
00:09:30,319 --> 00:09:31,779
we're all winners.

193
00:09:31,862 --> 00:09:33,739
That means this isn't working.

194
00:09:34,282 --> 00:09:35,992
[groans] We need a new game.

195
00:09:36,367 --> 00:09:37,451
[croaking]

196
00:09:41,914 --> 00:09:44,083
Ooh. I have an idea.

197
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:49,505
[roars]

198
00:09:51,132 --> 00:09:54,844
It would be really good
if your system could finish loading now.

199
00:09:54,927 --> 00:09:56,095
[Light Hope] I agree.

200
00:09:57,221 --> 00:10:00,057
However, my reboot
appears to have malfunctioned.

201
00:10:00,141 --> 00:10:02,602
Loading is frozen at 36 percent.

202
00:10:02,685 --> 00:10:07,064
We must manually override the system
to bring my programming fully online.

203
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:10,818
How do we do that?
And how can we do it fast?

204
00:10:12,653 --> 00:10:16,532
We must connect this data crystal
to the core processing unit.

205
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:20,036
I made a crystal.

206
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:27,543
So where is the core processing unit?
And please don't say--

207
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:29,962
It is on the other side of these spiders.

208
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:30,921
[She-Ra groans]

209
00:10:31,005 --> 00:10:31,922
Do not worry.

210
00:10:33,257 --> 00:10:34,675
I will assist you.

211
00:10:37,845 --> 00:10:40,181
Apologies. I made more spiders.

212
00:10:40,848 --> 00:10:42,850
Oh! I know what will help.

213
00:10:42,933 --> 00:10:43,768
No, don't--

214
00:10:47,021 --> 00:10:48,105
[coughing]

215
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:51,484
I simulated the ocean.
Spiders cannot swim.

216
00:10:51,567 --> 00:10:52,401
What the--?

217
00:10:54,278 --> 00:10:55,279
[grunts]

218
00:11:01,118 --> 00:11:01,952
[laughs]

219
00:11:02,036 --> 00:11:03,162
Perfect score.

220
00:11:03,788 --> 00:11:05,456
Ah? Ah?

221
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:07,458
Try to beat that.

222
00:11:08,084 --> 00:11:09,001
Okay, wait a minute.

223
00:11:09,085 --> 00:11:12,713
When Rogelio bounced it off of that thing,
you said it was minus five points.

224
00:11:13,005 --> 00:11:13,839
Mm-hm, mm-hm.

225
00:11:13,923 --> 00:11:17,176
Yes. He forgot the magic password,
and he's standing in the loser zone.

226
00:11:17,259 --> 00:11:20,304
You're not wearing the hat,
so another five-point deduction for you.

227
00:11:20,388 --> 00:11:23,182
What? These rules
don't even make any sense.

228
00:11:23,265 --> 00:11:24,433
You're just a sore loser.

229
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:26,936
Now, watch the master.

230
00:11:27,144 --> 00:11:28,312
[chuckles, then grunts]

231
00:11:30,564 --> 00:11:32,650
Hey! Watch out!

232
00:11:33,651 --> 00:11:34,652
[shouts]

233
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:44,286
Kyle, did you just lose the game
that you made up?

234
00:11:44,662 --> 00:11:46,163
Uh... [chuckles]

235
00:11:46,247 --> 00:11:50,418
No. No, that's a different move,
and I get all the points and I win.

236
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,962
Oh, uh-uh. No way. Not happening.

237
00:12:01,929 --> 00:12:03,180
[shouts]

238
00:12:03,722 --> 00:12:07,560
Apologies, She-Ra.
I did not know that humans cannot swim.

239
00:12:07,643 --> 00:12:11,063
However, you will note
that I did get rid of the spiders.

240
00:12:11,147 --> 00:12:13,399
I can swim.

241
00:12:13,482 --> 00:12:15,651
I just can't breathe under water.

242
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:19,989
Interesting. I shall make a note of this.

243
00:12:21,615 --> 00:12:22,533
[Adora grunts]

244
00:12:22,825 --> 00:12:25,369
It's not the ocean. I'll give you that.

245
00:12:28,664 --> 00:12:29,623
[grunting]

246
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:44,346
What's happening?

247
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:47,391
It seems that the spore storm outside
has worsened.

248
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:50,769
It is compromising the Crystal Castle.

249
00:12:51,854 --> 00:12:55,900
Don't tell me the information
for how to stop that hasn't loaded yet.

250
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:57,485
[shouts]

251
00:12:58,277 --> 00:13:00,779
We need to get
to the processing unit, now.

252
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:10,289
Place it in the left slot.

253
00:13:12,917 --> 00:13:14,210
Are you sure?

254
00:13:14,835 --> 00:13:15,920
Yes.

255
00:13:16,003 --> 00:13:21,383
Of course my system is only at 36 percent,
so I suppose I am 36 percent sure.

256
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:24,512
-Perfect.
-It is in fact far from perfect.

257
00:13:24,595 --> 00:13:26,096
I was being sarcastic.

258
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:28,057
What is "sarcastic"?

259
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:31,519
Trust me, that information
is never gonna load for you.

260
00:13:35,981 --> 00:13:37,024
Oh.

261
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:39,735
What?

262
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:45,449
So, is everything reset now?

263
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:47,910
Can you finish telling me
about the weapon and Mara?

264
00:13:47,993 --> 00:13:51,080
Hello, my name is Light Hope.
How may I assist you?

265
00:13:51,914 --> 00:13:53,123
[groans]

266
00:13:56,961 --> 00:14:00,005
Guys? Do you think anybody's
gonna come and save us?

267
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:03,092
Nobody is coming. We gotta save ourselves.

268
00:14:03,175 --> 00:14:05,511
And we better pick someone
to fix the transport soon

269
00:14:05,594 --> 00:14:07,221
or Catra is gonna kill us.

270
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:10,808
[grunts] I don't even know why we bother.

271
00:14:10,891 --> 00:14:14,562
She doesn't trust us.
She's obsessed with this big plan.

272
00:14:14,645 --> 00:14:16,480
It's the only thing that matters to her.

273
00:14:16,564 --> 00:14:17,690
[Kyle] Don't say that.

274
00:14:17,773 --> 00:14:19,108
Look, she may be mean,

275
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:22,403
but we've always had each other's backs
ever since we were kids.

276
00:14:22,486 --> 00:14:25,281
She probably sent us on this mission
for, like, team-building.

277
00:14:25,614 --> 00:14:26,490
[croaks]

278
00:14:26,574 --> 00:14:29,201
You guys are the only family
I've ever had.

279
00:14:29,285 --> 00:14:30,411
Even Catra.

280
00:14:30,494 --> 00:14:33,873
Remember when she used my ration bars
to make that cake for Adora?

281
00:14:33,956 --> 00:14:35,249
Uh, that never happened.

282
00:14:35,332 --> 00:14:37,668
That was the weird fake portal reality.

283
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:39,587
Wait, what?

284
00:14:41,005 --> 00:14:43,340
But we're a unit.

285
00:14:45,593 --> 00:14:46,552
[laughs]

286
00:14:47,011 --> 00:14:49,013
You wanna know what we really are?

287
00:14:49,638 --> 00:14:51,432
We're expendable.

288
00:14:51,515 --> 00:14:53,434
Catra doesn't care about us.

289
00:14:53,517 --> 00:14:55,227
Adora left us.

290
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:59,648
Everything they taught us in the Horde
about loyalty is meaningless.

291
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:01,734
It's everyone for themselves.

292
00:15:03,485 --> 00:15:05,696
Fine. Nothing matters, I guess.

293
00:15:05,779 --> 00:15:09,658
Then I'll do it. I'll fix the transport,
so I don't have to be stuck in here

294
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:11,952
with my non-friends anymore.

295
00:15:12,703 --> 00:15:13,704
[roaring]

296
00:15:14,455 --> 00:15:16,040
Oh, knock it off, Kyle.

297
00:15:16,123 --> 00:15:18,083
You knock it off, Kyle.

298
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:20,377
What? That doesn't even make any sense.

299
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:23,005
Nothing makes sense anymore.

300
00:15:23,088 --> 00:15:25,090
Kyle, quit fooling around.

301
00:15:25,174 --> 00:15:26,717
Will you help me out here?

302
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:27,801
[croaking]

303
00:15:28,802 --> 00:15:30,846
Me? This isn't my fault.

304
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:32,598
Rogelio.

305
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:42,524
Please tell me that this time
all your information has loaded.

306
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:44,360
I am back to full functionality.

307
00:15:47,071 --> 00:15:49,406
Disregard. That was incorrect.

308
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:52,785
My system reboot
is still at only 36 percent.

309
00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:55,579
Look. I made a bird.

310
00:15:55,663 --> 00:15:58,999
Of course, it was the wrong slot.
I don't know what I expected.

311
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:01,835
Even when you do know everything,
you don't tell me anything.

312
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:02,878
You are useless!

313
00:16:03,504 --> 00:16:04,421
[gasps]

314
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:09,969
Oh, Light Hope, I'm...

315
00:16:10,052 --> 00:16:11,637
I am a hologram.

316
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:14,598
My primary purpose is to train She-Ra.

317
00:16:14,682 --> 00:16:17,685
If I am not doing that,
then I have failed.

318
00:16:17,768 --> 00:16:19,144
I am sorry, Adora.

319
00:16:20,062 --> 00:16:21,605
Wait, Light Hope.

320
00:16:22,314 --> 00:16:23,273
Light Hope?

321
00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:30,155
[Mara] Light Hope.

322
00:16:33,784 --> 00:16:36,120
Light Hope. Look what I brought you.

323
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:37,496
[gasps]

324
00:16:38,122 --> 00:16:40,791
Flowers. They're blooming
all over the planet right now.

325
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:45,212
-Here, smell.
-I have no olfactory sensors.

326
00:16:45,295 --> 00:16:46,630
I cannot smell.

327
00:16:47,047 --> 00:16:48,966
[Mara] They're pretty, though, right?

328
00:16:49,049 --> 00:16:51,343
Pretty. Yes.

329
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:53,554
They are aesthetically pleasing.

330
00:16:53,637 --> 00:16:55,097
Thank you for bringing them.

331
00:16:55,889 --> 00:16:58,100
I thought they might liven the place up.

332
00:16:58,183 --> 00:17:00,936
I mean, it must be hard
being stuck in here all the time.

333
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:03,939
I do not mind.
Not when you come to visit me.

334
00:17:07,568 --> 00:17:08,444
[gasps]

335
00:17:09,069 --> 00:17:10,112
[laughing]

336
00:17:12,948 --> 00:17:17,453
I looked at my loaded data banks to see
if I could find the answers you seek.

337
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:21,457
All I have on Mara
is this memory and a sensation.

338
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:25,961
Warmth. Her memory brings me warmth.

339
00:17:27,379 --> 00:17:29,298
You and Mara were close?

340
00:17:29,381 --> 00:17:31,383
Yes. We were.

341
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:32,801
Are we not close?

342
00:17:33,635 --> 00:17:35,846
It's just that you keep things from me.

343
00:17:35,929 --> 00:17:39,141
I know it's in an everything-
will-make-sense-in-time kind of way,

344
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:41,018
but it's also pretty annoying.

345
00:17:41,435 --> 00:17:44,605
"Annoying." This word has not yet loaded.
Is it good?

346
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:46,231
No.

347
00:17:46,315 --> 00:17:47,775
I did not think so.

348
00:17:47,858 --> 00:17:51,153
It is my role to watch over She-Ra.

349
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:53,238
I want to serve She-Ra,

350
00:17:53,322 --> 00:17:56,200
to protect her
to the best of my abilities.

351
00:17:56,283 --> 00:17:59,369
But sometimes,
those abilities are not enough.

352
00:17:59,453 --> 00:18:01,663
Sometimes I feel that way too.

353
00:18:02,539 --> 00:18:05,542
I'm sorry about Mara, and I'm...

354
00:18:05,959 --> 00:18:07,503
I'm sorry I'm not her.

355
00:18:08,504 --> 00:18:11,423
But we could be friends too, if you want.

356
00:18:12,883 --> 00:18:14,051
Friends.

357
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:17,262
Yes. I would like that.

358
00:18:18,013 --> 00:18:19,807
Come on, let's get you fixed.

359
00:18:27,022 --> 00:18:27,940
[grunting]

360
00:18:32,277 --> 00:18:34,655
Okay, you made your point, Kyle.

361
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:37,574

363
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:48,127
[shouting]

364
00:19:01,181 --> 00:19:03,058
We shouldn't have let him go out alone.

365
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:08,313
The armor plating?
Oh, Catra will kill us if it's damaged.

366
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:13,277
[grunting]

367
00:19:19,741 --> 00:19:21,076

[Lonnie grunting]

369
00:19:43,265 --> 00:19:44,391
[groaning]

370
00:20:00,782 --> 00:20:03,410
You promise this other slot
is the right one?

371
00:20:04,119 --> 00:20:06,079
I am 36 percent sure.

372
00:20:07,122 --> 00:20:07,998
It'll have to do.

373
00:20:27,434 --> 00:20:28,268
Feeling better?

374
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:30,646
Reboot complete.

375
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:32,439
Hello, Adora.

376
00:20:33,357 --> 00:20:35,317
The spore cloud has dissipated.

377
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,236
It is safe for you to leave.

378
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:39,196
You don't wanna hang out with me anymore?

379
00:20:40,113 --> 00:20:41,657
What would we hang from?

380
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:45,452
Come on, we just saved the Crystal Castle.

381
00:20:45,535 --> 00:20:48,205
There is still the matter
of balancing the planet.

382
00:20:49,998 --> 00:20:52,125
I know that you're just trying
to protect me,

383
00:20:52,209 --> 00:20:55,337
but now that we're friends,
you know you can trust me

384
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:57,965
with the truth about everything, right?

385
00:20:58,465 --> 00:21:02,135
Once you balance the planet,
all will become clear.

386
00:21:03,178 --> 00:21:04,096
[sighs]

387
00:21:04,346 --> 00:21:05,555
We'll get there.

388
00:21:09,893 --> 00:21:10,852
[groaning]

389
00:21:15,315 --> 00:21:17,901
You came for me. You do care.

390
00:21:19,528 --> 00:21:23,240
We just knew you were gonna mess it up
like you always do. Okay?

391
00:21:24,408 --> 00:21:25,826
[growling]

392
00:21:48,223 --> 00:21:51,852
[chuckles] Hey, you too, buddy.

393
00:21:52,519 --> 00:21:53,687
Probably?

394
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:56,648
All right, we've gotta get back
to the Fright Zone.

395
00:21:57,607 --> 00:22:00,277
Just keep your leg elevated till then.

396
00:22:07,659 --> 00:22:09,369
[Mara] They're pretty, though, right?

397
00:22:09,453 --> 00:22:13,206
[Light Hope] Pretty. Yes.
They are aesthetically pleasing.

398
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:14,958
Thank you for bringing them.

399
00:22:15,042 --> 00:22:16,960
I thought they might liven the place up.

400
00:22:17,044 --> 00:22:19,546
It must be hard
being stuck in here all the time.

401
00:22:19,629 --> 00:22:22,549
I do not mind.
Not when you come to visit me.

402
00:22:22,632 --> 00:22:24,134
[laughing]

403
00:22:27,888 --> 00:22:29,973
This memory should have been purged

404
00:22:30,057 --> 00:22:33,435
per directive
of the Heart of Etheria Project.

405
00:22:33,518 --> 00:22:35,896
Permanently delete.
