1
00:00:17,809 --> 00:00:19,144
[Catra] Pull the switch.

2
00:00:19,227 --> 00:00:20,979
And let's end this.

3
00:00:21,062 --> 00:00:22,814
[Adora] Catra. Please, don't.

4
00:00:22,939 --> 00:00:23,773
No!

5
00:00:24,315 --> 00:00:25,650
[Catra] Adora.

6
00:00:26,067 --> 00:00:26,901
Adora.

7
00:00:27,569 --> 00:00:28,403
[grunting]

8
00:00:28,486 --> 00:00:30,697
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Adora.

9
00:00:31,072 --> 00:00:33,074
Heh. Since when do you sleep in?

10
00:00:34,576 --> 00:00:36,870
{\an8}Where am I? How did I get here?

11
00:00:37,495 --> 00:00:39,664
{\an8}Uh, you're in your room. Are you okay?

12
00:00:39,748 --> 00:00:44,169
{\an8}I... I'm fine.
I was just having a weird dream.

13
00:00:44,294 --> 00:00:45,962
{\an8}There was something I needed to fix.

14
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:48,548
Of course you dream about work.

15
00:00:48,631 --> 00:00:51,634
{\an8}There's nothing to fix, Adora.
Everything's perfect.

16
00:00:52,343 --> 00:00:53,178
Yeah.

17
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:54,804
It was just a dream.

18
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:57,182
{\an8}Come on, get up.

19
00:01:04,731 --> 00:01:05,565
Adora.

[Horde soldiers] Adora. It's really her.
It's her. It's Adora.

30
00:01:53,446 --> 00:01:54,989
-We love you, Adora.
-Yeah.

31
00:01:55,073 --> 00:01:56,407
-Yes.
-All right.

32
00:01:57,492 --> 00:01:59,577
-What are they all looking at?
-You.

33
00:01:59,661 --> 00:02:03,623
The Invasion of Thaymor went perfectly.
You're the hero of the hour.

34
00:02:03,873 --> 00:02:04,791
Thaymor?

35
00:02:07,043 --> 00:02:08,044
Oh.

36
00:02:08,461 --> 00:02:11,840
Yeah. I defeated the rebel insurgents
at Thaymor.

37
00:02:11,923 --> 00:02:13,133
Yeah. [chuckles]

38
00:02:13,424 --> 00:02:14,342
I did that.

39
00:02:14,551 --> 00:02:17,387
Oh, please,
you couldn't have done it without me.

40
00:02:17,512 --> 00:02:18,513
Right.

41
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:20,890
What would I ever do without you?

42
00:02:21,224 --> 00:02:22,642
[both laughing]

43
00:02:22,725 --> 00:02:25,353
[soldier] Hey.
Watch where you're going, twerp.

44
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:30,191
Force Captain. I didn't know you were--
I'm so sorry.

45
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,318
You'd better be. Dismissed.

46
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:37,073
[both laughing]

47
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:39,909
Oh, Force Captain, don't hurt me.

48
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:40,952
[groans]

49
00:02:41,035 --> 00:02:42,287
[both laughing]

50
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:44,497
-Too good.
-Where are we going again?

51
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:47,083
The locker room.
There's something I wanna show you.

52
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:50,044
Why are we going the long way?
Let's take the side door, right--

53
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:51,754
Huh.

54
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:55,466
What? It's always been this way.
Are you sure you're okay?

55
00:02:55,717 --> 00:02:57,468
Yeah, I'm okay.

56
00:02:57,844 --> 00:03:00,722
Do you have a concussion?
I know you get hit on the head a lot.

57
00:03:00,805 --> 00:03:03,683
But I figured your dumb little hair poof
would cushion the blow.

58
00:03:03,766 --> 00:03:06,394
I'm fine, okay?
Don't make me kick your butt.

59
00:03:06,477 --> 00:03:08,813
-Pfft. As if you could.
-[laughs]

60
00:03:10,398 --> 00:03:11,649
-[Lonnie] Surprise.
-Huh?

61
00:03:11,733 --> 00:03:13,151
Surprise.

62
00:03:13,234 --> 00:03:14,736
What is this?

63
00:03:15,403 --> 00:03:16,821
Are those ration bars?

64
00:03:16,905 --> 00:03:20,199
We wouldn't have been able to defeat
the rebels at Thaymor without you.

65
00:03:20,283 --> 00:03:23,369
Plus, you were the one who talked
Shadow Weaver into letting us come.

66
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:25,246
So, we all pitched in,

67
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:28,166
took Kyle's ration bars for a week
and made this.

68
00:03:28,249 --> 00:03:31,002
I'm hungry,
but celebrating your victory is worth it.

69
00:03:31,085 --> 00:03:32,295
You guys.

70
00:03:32,378 --> 00:03:34,005
You even got the gray kind.

71
00:03:34,088 --> 00:03:36,215
It's way better than the brown kind.

72
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:38,301
-Hey, it was Catra's idea.
-Oh, yeah?

73
00:03:38,384 --> 00:03:40,637
Eh, whatever,
don't make a big deal about it.

74
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,680
Wow, I can't believe you like me.

75
00:03:42,764 --> 00:03:44,891
-That is so embarrassing for you.
-Ow.

76
00:03:44,974 --> 00:03:48,978
Stop it. Get off.
This is not because I like you.

77
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:51,940
[grunts] No. No, no, no. [shouts]

78
00:03:52,482 --> 00:03:53,816
Oh, come on, Kyle.

79
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:54,734
Sorry.

80
00:03:54,817 --> 00:03:56,069
[both laughing]

81
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:00,490
-[Kyle] Dang it.
-Whatever.

82
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:03,493
-What?
-[Catra] Hang on.

83
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:06,412
You got something right there.

84
00:04:06,496 --> 00:04:07,830
[Catra laughing]

85
00:04:09,374 --> 00:04:12,085
-[Shadow Weaver] Adora. Get off the floor.
-[gasps]

86
00:04:12,168 --> 00:04:14,963
You are the Force Captain
who sacked Thaymor.

87
00:04:15,046 --> 00:04:16,339
Sorry, Shadow Weaver.

88
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:18,216
[Shadow Weaver] And you.

89
00:04:21,302 --> 00:04:24,973
Look at you. You're a mess.
Go get yourself cleaned up.

90
00:04:25,556 --> 00:04:27,392
You're no longer children.

91
00:04:27,725 --> 00:04:29,936
I have high hopes for you both.

92
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:32,939
Do not waste your time
on such foolish games.

93
00:04:33,022 --> 00:04:34,816
Yes, Shadow Weaver.

94
00:04:34,899 --> 00:04:36,859
[Shadow Weaver] Adora, come with me.

95
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:41,656
[grunts]

96
00:04:42,031 --> 00:04:46,995
I will admit, I did not think that Catra
and the others were ready to be deployed.

97
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,331
But under your command,
they performed admirably.

98
00:04:50,456 --> 00:04:54,419
You are becoming every bit the leader
I always knew you to be.

99
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:58,631
Thank you, Shadow Weaver.
I couldn't have done it without them.

100
00:04:58,715 --> 00:05:03,094
Suffice it to say,
Hordak is impressed with your performance.

101
00:05:03,469 --> 00:05:06,472
He is rewarding you with a new mission.

102
00:05:06,556 --> 00:05:07,390
Really?

103
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:10,893
You'll get the rest of the details
at briefing. Look at it.

104
00:05:11,477 --> 00:05:13,313
This is who you are.

105
00:05:13,396 --> 00:05:16,983
The Force Captain
who will lead the Horde to victory.

106
00:05:17,066 --> 00:05:19,319
-It's what you've always dreamed of.
-[gasps]

107
00:05:19,402 --> 00:05:21,988
Everything is perfect.

108
00:05:22,071 --> 00:05:23,573
[Razz] Mara, dearie.

109
00:05:25,241 --> 00:05:26,701
What did you just say?

110
00:05:26,784 --> 00:05:29,495
I said,
are you ready for the briefing, Adora?

111
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:32,665
Now run along.
Don't keep the sergeant waiting.

112
00:05:35,084 --> 00:05:36,502
[gasps]

113
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:37,712
[chattering]

114
00:05:40,923 --> 00:05:42,467
Hi. I'm Scorpia.

115
00:05:42,675 --> 00:05:44,052
Oh, hey. Adora.

116
00:05:47,555 --> 00:05:52,185
You know, I don't know what it is,
but I do not like you.

117
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:57,106
It's this gut feeling I have. Maybe it's
that poof thing you do with your hair.

118
00:05:57,190 --> 00:06:00,526
Or how much it draws attention
to your gigantic forehead.

119
00:06:01,152 --> 00:06:05,615
-Okay, can everyone lay off my hair today?
-What kind of a name is "Adora"?

120
00:06:05,698 --> 00:06:08,785
It's like,
okay, I get it, everyone loves you.

121
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:11,579
-But I do not.
-[man] Welcome, Force Captains.

122
00:06:11,662 --> 00:06:14,665
After the perfect execution
of our mission in Thaymor,

123
00:06:14,749 --> 00:06:15,583
[chuckles]

124
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:19,504
the Horde is now in a better position
than ever to take the rest of Etheria.

125
00:06:19,837 --> 00:06:21,130
And here is our next target.

126
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:24,717
The Salineas Sea Gate,
separating Horde territory

127
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:26,594
from rebel-controlled waters.

128
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:29,055
We have a week to plan,

129
00:06:29,597 --> 00:06:31,432
-then it's go-time, people.
-[gasps]

130
00:06:31,808 --> 00:06:36,145
Now, it's possible that you might have
to go face-to-face with a Princess.

131
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:37,230
[gasps]

132
00:06:37,313 --> 00:06:40,191
They're powerful
and completely devoid of conscience.

133
00:06:40,274 --> 00:06:42,485
But it's possible to take them out.

134
00:06:42,568 --> 00:06:43,986
[shouting]

135
00:06:45,321 --> 00:06:47,198
[Razz] What happened to the stars?

136
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:48,950
What's going on?

137
00:06:50,284 --> 00:06:53,246
Uh, Force Captain Adora?
You have something to say?

138
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:55,748
Where's the screen?

139
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:58,209
There's no screen.

140
00:06:58,459 --> 00:07:00,503
All the information
should be in your report.

141
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:02,588
[gasps]

142
00:07:03,798 --> 00:07:05,299
Force Captain.

143
00:07:20,857 --> 00:07:21,983
[shouts]

144
00:07:24,193 --> 00:07:25,027
[Catra] Adora?

145
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:28,030
Adora, what is wrong?

146
00:07:29,574 --> 00:07:30,700
Did you write this?

147
00:07:31,534 --> 00:07:34,871
Did I write a blank piece of paper?
I'm gonna go with no.

148
00:07:36,205 --> 00:07:39,917
No, there was something--
Something there, I-- I think.

149
00:07:40,168 --> 00:07:43,504
-And I was running. Why was I running?
-Okay, calm down.

150
00:07:43,588 --> 00:07:47,508
I can't. There's something I keep
forgetting, something I'm supposed to fix.

151
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:51,637
I remember a sword, a bright light,
and you were there-- [shouts]

152
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:55,766
Ow. What was that?

153
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:58,811
Sorry. You were freaking out
and it was freaking me out.

154
00:07:58,895 --> 00:08:00,396
Well, you didn't have to slap me.

155
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,732
Come on, let's get you outside.
You need some air.

156
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:06,277
No, Catra, I don't need air.

157
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:09,197
How did we get here?

158
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:13,743
We climbed up, like we always do.
Don't you remember?

159
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:17,413
I don't know what's happening to me.
It's like I'm losing my mind.

160
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:20,291
-You just need to relax.
-Yeah.

161
00:08:20,374 --> 00:08:23,336
You're probably right.
I'm fine. Everything's fine.

162
00:08:27,798 --> 00:08:30,301
Of course I'm right. Everything's perfect.

163
00:08:30,468 --> 00:08:33,513
Soon, the two of us
are gonna be ruling Etheria together,

164
00:08:33,596 --> 00:08:35,431
just like we always planned.

165
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:40,144
Is that what you really want?
To rule the world?

166
00:08:40,645 --> 00:08:44,732
I mean, yeah, obviously.
Isn't that what you want, too?

167
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:49,695
I don't know.

168
00:08:50,321 --> 00:08:53,282
Don't flake out on me now.
This is what we always wanted.

169
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:56,077
Everything'll be perfect
as long as we stay together.

170
00:08:57,036 --> 00:09:00,456
What if we don't stay together?
What if it all goes wrong?

171
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:03,834
Why can't you see that?

172
00:09:03,918 --> 00:09:04,919
Adora.

173
00:09:05,002 --> 00:09:06,963
Stay with me, okay?

174
00:09:07,171 --> 00:09:08,714
You're just seeing things.

175
00:09:10,508 --> 00:09:12,093
It's all in your head.

176
00:09:12,843 --> 00:09:13,844
[Lonnie] Adora.

177
00:09:13,928 --> 00:09:16,514
Catra. Thought we'd find you up there.

178
00:09:17,098 --> 00:09:19,100
Get down here. We got big news.

179
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:20,685
What?

180
00:09:21,602 --> 00:09:26,023
Okay, okay. We just got word,
we're being sent to Salineas tonight.

181
00:09:26,107 --> 00:09:29,360
But they said at the briefing
that's not for another week.

182
00:09:30,945 --> 00:09:33,781
Adora, it's been a week.

183
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:37,493
No.

184
00:09:39,036 --> 00:09:41,414
-Adora?
-[shouts] I know this is wrong.

185
00:09:41,497 --> 00:09:44,458
Can't you see it? My memories don't match.
We're jumping around.

186
00:09:44,542 --> 00:09:49,213
Things are disappearing. It's like time
and space aren't working right. And I--

187
00:09:49,297 --> 00:09:50,965
Adora, stop it. Stop.

188
00:09:52,967 --> 00:09:56,721
Mara. Portal. I think I remember.
None of this is right.

189
00:09:57,555 --> 00:10:00,975
-We're not supposed to be here.
-Adora. Everything's okay.

190
00:10:01,058 --> 00:10:03,352
Stop saying that. This isn't right.

191
00:10:04,061 --> 00:10:06,939
Everyone keeps telling me
everything is perfect, but it's not.

192
00:10:09,233 --> 00:10:10,818
Everyone except Scorpia.

193
00:10:11,652 --> 00:10:14,947
Adora. Adora, where are you going?

194
00:10:17,158 --> 00:10:18,868
You don't think things are perfect.

195
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:20,077
Whoa.

196
00:10:20,161 --> 00:10:23,956
Ever heard of personal space?
I happen to take it very seriously.

197
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:26,250
And also, what are you talking about?

198
00:10:26,334 --> 00:10:28,377
Things aren't right.
You must feel it, too.

199
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:30,755
I'm not sure why yet,
but I'm starting to remember.

200
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:33,799
I need to get into Hordak's sanctum
and you need to help me.

201
00:10:34,925 --> 00:10:36,052
Hordak's sanctum?

202
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:37,219
[laughing]

203
00:10:37,511 --> 00:10:38,679
I'm not sure if you know,

204
00:10:38,763 --> 00:10:41,599
but no one is allowed in there
without express permission.

205
00:10:41,682 --> 00:10:46,395
I mean, this is basic stuff. Are you sure
you're qualified to be a Force Captain?

206
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:48,898
All of my memories stop
in Hordak's sanctum.

207
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:51,776
There's something in there,
something powerful and dangerous.

208
00:10:51,859 --> 00:10:55,863
That's where it all started.
That's where I have to go to fix things.

209
00:10:55,946 --> 00:10:59,742
Okay, Adora, I totally hear you.
Everything's gonna be fine.

210
00:10:59,825 --> 00:11:03,746
In fact, I think I know some nice people
who can help if you just--

211
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:06,499
Scorpia, you have to remember something.

212
00:11:06,582 --> 00:11:07,875
Tell me you remember.

213
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:10,670
Everyone's acting like things are perfect,
except for you.

214
00:11:10,753 --> 00:11:12,630
-Even Catra is--
-Catra?

215
00:11:15,758 --> 00:11:16,967
You do remember.

216
00:11:17,051 --> 00:11:18,052
No, I--

217
00:11:20,763 --> 00:11:22,181
I mean, I don't know.

218
00:11:22,431 --> 00:11:23,516
And Catra,

219
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:26,811
she was just scared, she didn't mean to--

220
00:11:27,436 --> 00:11:30,147
What is going on?
I keep forgetting things.

221
00:11:30,981 --> 00:11:32,149
This is all wrong.

222
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,609
How did we get here?

223
00:11:33,692 --> 00:11:37,363
I don't know. I just know we have to go
to Hordak's sanctum.

224
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:42,201
-How did we get here?
-Just go with it, okay?

225
00:11:43,411 --> 00:11:45,246
We need to get past those guards.

226
00:11:47,123 --> 00:11:50,835
Oh, man, this is a bad plan.
What happens if we get caught?

227
00:11:50,918 --> 00:11:52,086
We are so fired.

228
00:11:52,169 --> 00:11:54,422
-Shh. Shh.
-Shh. Shh.

229
00:11:55,131 --> 00:11:56,090
Enough. Stop it.

230
00:11:56,173 --> 00:11:57,508
Don't. Don't.

231
00:11:57,591 --> 00:11:59,301
Don't. Just move. Move.

232
00:11:59,677 --> 00:12:02,054
[soldier] Hey.
What are you doing here? Hands up.

233
00:12:02,513 --> 00:12:04,348
[shouting, then gasps]

234
00:12:05,933 --> 00:12:06,934
[shouts]

235
00:12:07,017 --> 00:12:10,020
Did I just do that? I am so fired.

236
00:12:10,104 --> 00:12:12,440
Scorpia, you need to focus.

237
00:12:13,023 --> 00:12:16,277
-None of that matters.
-I don't like this.

238
00:12:18,863 --> 00:12:19,697
Uh...

239
00:12:20,156 --> 00:12:22,658
Wasn't there a door here
just a second ago?

240
00:12:23,325 --> 00:12:26,370
Things are disappearing.
It's getting worse.

241
00:12:26,537 --> 00:12:28,789
We have to hurry.
There's gotta be another way in.

242
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:31,417
There.

243
00:12:32,209 --> 00:12:33,836
-It's that lady.
-What lady?

244
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:35,838
The one who says "Mara." Come on.

245
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:37,506
Okay, that makes no sense.

246
00:12:37,673 --> 00:12:40,759
But I'm gonna follow you because
I don't see a lot of other options.

247
00:12:41,552 --> 00:12:42,386
Wait.

248
00:12:47,057 --> 00:12:49,518
[Scorpia] Oh, she's so fast. Okay.

249
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:52,313
[Razz humming]

250
00:13:05,993 --> 00:13:07,077
[grunting]

251
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:08,954
[Adora] What?

252
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:15,252
[panting] Why is everyone so fast?

253
00:13:16,086 --> 00:13:18,714
-Whoa.
-This is it. Come on.

254
00:13:19,673 --> 00:13:21,258
I hope this works.

255
00:13:21,342 --> 00:13:23,260
It will. And you can go back to hating me.

256
00:13:23,344 --> 00:13:26,847
Look, if you get us out of this,
I promise I won't hate you.

257
00:13:26,931 --> 00:13:28,974
I will just dislike you
a reasonable amount.

258
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:30,059
Deal.

259
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:34,772
No. No, no.

260
00:13:34,855 --> 00:13:37,858
This can't be right.
It was here, it was right here.

261
00:13:38,859 --> 00:13:39,735
Where is it?

262
00:13:39,985 --> 00:13:40,819
[groans]

263
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:42,488
No.

264
00:13:43,948 --> 00:13:45,783
Catra. It was Catra.

265
00:13:46,116 --> 00:13:48,661
Catra did this.
She captured me, she took...

266
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:52,039
the sword. She activated the portal.

267
00:13:52,122 --> 00:13:53,040
Sword?

268
00:13:53,123 --> 00:13:55,626
The sword. There's supposed to be a sword.

269
00:13:56,085 --> 00:13:57,586
My sword. But it's gone.

270
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,046
It's in the portal.

271
00:13:59,129 --> 00:14:01,048
That's why we're here. I need to find it.

272
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:02,800
[Imp chittering, then gasps]

273
00:14:02,883 --> 00:14:03,717
Quick. Hide.

274
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:30,703
Oh, that was close.

275
00:14:30,786 --> 00:14:31,954
[screeching]

276
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:33,247
-Run.
-[shouts]

277
00:14:38,961 --> 00:14:41,630
What is happening?
I don't understand what's going on.

278
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:42,965
Adora, wait. Wait up.

279
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:44,550
[gasps]

280
00:14:45,634 --> 00:14:46,468
Scorpia?

281
00:14:47,636 --> 00:14:48,637
Scorpia.

282
00:14:49,597 --> 00:14:50,931
[groaning]

283
00:15:05,654 --> 00:15:06,906
[gasps] Wait.

284
00:15:08,157 --> 00:15:10,492
Why, hello, Mara dearie.

285
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:14,288
Who are you? Why do I know you?
What are you doing in the Fright Zone?

286
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:16,498
Is this real?

287
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:18,417
I am afraid so, dearie.

288
00:15:18,709 --> 00:15:21,503
But you can still fix it.
There's still time.

289
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:29,219
Find me in the woods, dearie.

290
00:15:31,013 --> 00:15:35,225
-Adora. Adora, where have you been?
-Lonnie, we have to get out of here.

291
00:15:35,559 --> 00:15:37,728
-Where are Kyle and Rogelio?
-Who?

292
00:15:37,811 --> 00:15:41,315
Our teammates since we were kids.
Where are they?

293
00:15:41,398 --> 00:15:43,525
Uh... I don't remember.

294
00:15:43,901 --> 00:15:46,779
I think... I think they're gone?

295
00:15:50,324 --> 00:15:51,909
What is going on?

296
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:55,245
Come on.

297
00:15:58,082 --> 00:15:59,083
[Lonnie shouting]

298
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:10,302
Lonnie, we have to-- [gasps]

299
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:13,555
[shouting]

300
00:16:22,523 --> 00:16:23,732
Catra.

301
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:24,650
Adora.

302
00:16:27,569 --> 00:16:30,322
Hey.
You've officially lost it, haven't you?

303
00:16:30,406 --> 00:16:32,616
Listen, we have to go. Now.

304
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:35,577
Scorpia, Lonnie, Kyle, Rogelio,
they're all gone.

305
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:40,207
-What're you talking about? Who's gone?
-They're gone. There's nothing left.

306
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:42,835
And we'll be next
if we don't get out of here right now.

307
00:16:43,419 --> 00:16:47,172
[grunts] You're not making any sense.
Everything's fine, okay?

308
00:16:47,256 --> 00:16:50,884
Don't say it's perfect.
I know it's not perfect and so do you.

309
00:16:57,099 --> 00:16:59,601
You've gone crazy. I'm not going anywhere.

310
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:00,519
Catra.

311
00:17:03,063 --> 00:17:04,189
What are you--?

312
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:38,640
[grunting and shouting]

313
00:17:41,602 --> 00:17:42,603
Catra, no.

314
00:18:01,705 --> 00:18:03,540
Catra, you can't.

315
00:18:03,624 --> 00:18:06,251
We need to get as far
from the Fright Zone as possible

316
00:18:06,335 --> 00:18:09,046
or we'll be completely erased
along with everything else.

317
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:11,965
You think you can convince me
by kidnapping me?

318
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:13,467
What is wrong with you?

319
00:18:15,803 --> 00:18:17,638
I won't leave you behind again.

320
00:18:17,721 --> 00:18:19,807
Why can't you just stay?

321
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:21,892
We have everything we ever wanted.

322
00:18:22,184 --> 00:18:23,811
It's not real, Catra.

323
00:18:24,228 --> 00:18:27,898
As much as I wish that things
could be simple the way they used to be,

324
00:18:27,981 --> 00:18:30,067
-there's no going back.
-[shouts]

325
00:18:34,655 --> 00:18:36,240
Why did you do it?

326
00:18:36,323 --> 00:18:38,659
I don't know what you're talking about.

327
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:45,833
There's no time.

328
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:47,751
-We have to go.
-[grunts]

329
00:18:48,335 --> 00:18:50,838
You look out for me
and I look out for you.

330
00:18:50,921 --> 00:18:53,757
Nothing really bad can happen
as long as we have each other.

331
00:18:53,841 --> 00:18:55,008
You promise?

332
00:18:55,092 --> 00:18:55,968
I promise.

333
00:18:56,051 --> 00:18:59,054
Everything will be okay
if we just stay together.

334
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:03,350
Come with me. You don't have
to go back there. We can fix this.

335
00:19:03,892 --> 00:19:06,645
Help me fix this. Please.

336
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:08,897
This can't be what you wanted.

337
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:11,775
Don't you get it?
I am never going to go with you.

338
00:19:14,111 --> 00:19:15,529
[laughing]

339
00:19:18,532 --> 00:19:22,452
You always have to go and ruin it,
don't you?

340
00:19:23,787 --> 00:19:25,330
[grunting and shouting]

341
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:34,464
Catra, look what's happening.

342
00:19:34,548 --> 00:19:36,633
You're going to destroy everything.

343
00:19:36,717 --> 00:19:38,844
I don't care.

344
00:19:39,136 --> 00:19:41,013
I won't let you win.

345
00:19:41,096 --> 00:19:44,933
I'd rather see the whole world end
than let that happen.

346
00:19:50,314 --> 00:19:51,398
Catra, no.

347
00:19:54,776 --> 00:19:55,819
Catra.

348
00:20:12,127 --> 00:20:13,295
[sobbing]

349
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:24,973
Oh, is that you, Mara?

350
00:20:25,432 --> 00:20:26,975
You made it after all.

351
00:20:29,353 --> 00:20:30,562
Madame Razz.

352
00:20:30,646 --> 00:20:34,983
It's been such a long time
since we last saw each other, hasn't it?

353
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:37,110
That or it hasn't happened yet.

354
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:41,323
-I always get those two things mixed up.
-I couldn't save anyone else.

355
00:20:41,406 --> 00:20:42,950
It's not too late.

356
00:20:43,116 --> 00:20:46,161
You can still bring them back.
But you must act quickly.

357
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:48,080
How do you know all of this?

358
00:20:48,455 --> 00:20:51,041
Because this has all happened before.

359
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:53,710
I remember it like it was yesterday.

360
00:20:54,044 --> 00:20:56,046
For Madame Razz, it was yesterday.

361
00:20:57,172 --> 00:20:59,925
This happened before with Mara.

362
00:21:00,008 --> 00:21:01,301
Yes, dearie.

363
00:21:01,385 --> 00:21:04,346
When she moved Etheria
and took away the stars.

364
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:06,098
Heh. It was crazy.

365
00:21:06,598 --> 00:21:07,933
It's all my fault.

366
00:21:08,392 --> 00:21:11,103
I've been so afraid
of becoming another Mara.

367
00:21:11,478 --> 00:21:15,983
Destroying the world the way she did.
And now it's happening.

368
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:17,025
[grunts]

369
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:19,486
Destroy the world? No.

370
00:21:19,736 --> 00:21:22,614
Mara saved the world. And so will you.

371
00:21:22,739 --> 00:21:26,952
But you can't waste any more time.
You need to go back to the beginning.

372
00:21:27,035 --> 00:21:29,204
You need to find the sword.

373
00:21:29,371 --> 00:21:31,540
That is the only way this will stop.

374
00:21:31,623 --> 00:21:35,002
I did that, didn't I?
I went back to the Fright Zone.

375
00:21:35,085 --> 00:21:36,795
The portal wasn't there.

376
00:21:36,878 --> 00:21:39,047
No, that wasn't the beginning.

377
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:41,633
You need to go back to the very beginning.

378
00:21:41,717 --> 00:21:43,719
I don't understand.

379
00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:45,345
That's all right, dearie.

380
00:21:45,512 --> 00:21:49,182
You don't need to understand.
You just need to remember.

381
00:21:54,688 --> 00:21:56,148
I have to remember.

382
00:22:01,194 --> 00:22:02,154
Bow and Glimmer.

383
00:22:02,612 --> 00:22:03,822
I need to find them.

384
00:22:04,031 --> 00:22:06,241
Go on, dearie. Quickly.

385
00:22:25,093 --> 00:22:26,219
[groaning]

386
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:44,362
[closing theme playing]
