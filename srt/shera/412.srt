1
00:00:29,654 --> 00:00:33,950
{\an8}[Shadow Weaver] Please keep your bot
out of my flower beds.

2
00:00:34,325 --> 00:00:36,161
Oh! Oh, sorry about that.

3
00:00:36,411 --> 00:00:38,413
-Emily! Emily, come here.
-[crashing]

4
00:00:38,496 --> 00:00:40,790
No, no, not in the skull plant things.

5
00:00:41,332 --> 00:00:43,460
{\an8}Oh... [grunts] Um, uh...

6
00:00:44,002 --> 00:00:47,922
{\an8}So, uh, they just let you have
your own garden here?

7
00:00:48,131 --> 00:00:49,924
{\an8}Aren't you a prisoner? Am I a prisoner?

8
00:00:50,049 --> 00:00:51,634
Everyone's been so nice.

9
00:00:51,718 --> 00:00:53,845
How come we're not, you know, in a prison?

10
00:00:53,928 --> 00:00:55,388
Is this garden a prison?

11
00:00:55,555 --> 00:00:57,891
It wasn't until today.

12
00:00:58,099 --> 00:00:59,267
Oh.

13
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:01,686
Right, right, sorry.

14
00:01:01,978 --> 00:01:04,397
I-- I'm not even here. Just garden away.

15
00:01:06,191 --> 00:01:07,025
Emily!

16
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:09,319
Emily, what did I just say?

17
00:01:09,402 --> 00:01:12,363
-I said stay out of the skull plants.
-[groaning]

18
00:01:12,572 --> 00:01:14,115
Bad bot! Bad.

19
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,075
Hey, drop it.

20
00:01:15,158 --> 00:01:16,242
[Glimmer] Scorpia!

21
00:01:20,371 --> 00:01:22,290
[Shadow Weaver] Your Majesty, you're back.

22
00:01:22,373 --> 00:01:24,793
-Did you find what you were looking for?
-Yes.

23
00:01:24,876 --> 00:01:28,129
Light Hope told me everything
I need to know, and I have a plan.

24
00:01:28,296 --> 00:01:30,924
A plan? Excellent. We should discuss--

25
00:01:35,595 --> 00:01:37,430
Scorpia, I need your help.

26
00:01:37,514 --> 00:01:39,682
-Me?
-You're the only person

27
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:41,559
who can save Etheria.

28
00:01:41,643 --> 00:01:44,562
We need you to reconnect
to the Black Garnet.

29
00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:45,605
Huh?

30
00:01:45,688 --> 00:01:48,191
[Shadow Weaver]
What? Your Majesty, I don't understand.

31
00:01:48,274 --> 00:01:51,110
We should reconvene
with the other princesses and--

32
00:01:51,194 --> 00:01:52,570
The other princesses are gone.

33
00:01:52,654 --> 00:01:54,447
-But it's fine.
-[Shadow Weaver] Gone?

34
00:01:54,531 --> 00:01:56,574
I said, it's fine. I have a plan--

35
00:01:56,658 --> 00:01:57,992
Gone where?

36
00:01:58,284 --> 00:02:01,246
Okay, would anyone else
like to interrupt me?

37
00:02:01,329 --> 00:02:06,167
[clearing throat] I'm sorry, Your Majesty,
but Double Trouble has escaped.

49
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:48,918
-What an incredible coincidence.
-Uh...

50
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:50,962
It's not a coincidence.

51
00:02:51,045 --> 00:02:52,463
We came to find you.

52
00:02:52,547 --> 00:02:54,674
Beast Island Log, tide cycle 37.

53
00:02:54,757 --> 00:02:58,303
I have confirmed
that the outside world still exists.

54
00:02:58,386 --> 00:03:00,221
I found princesses.

55
00:03:00,305 --> 00:03:03,433
Well, one princess,
some sort of horse-bird hybrid,

56
00:03:03,516 --> 00:03:05,059
Bow, and...

57
00:03:06,728 --> 00:03:07,812
I don't know you.

58
00:03:07,896 --> 00:03:09,022
Yes, you do.

59
00:03:09,981 --> 00:03:11,107
You stole my food.

60
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:12,400
Oh, yeah.

61
00:03:12,483 --> 00:03:14,152
It was delicious.

62
00:03:15,236 --> 00:03:17,822
Wasn't there another one of you?

63
00:03:17,906 --> 00:03:19,741
Yes. Glimmer.

64
00:03:19,824 --> 00:03:21,075
You know her.

65
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:23,411
And she's not here.

66
00:03:23,494 --> 00:03:25,413
Can we talk about how I am not a bird?

67
00:03:25,496 --> 00:03:28,625
Entrapta, we have been looking
all over the this island for you.

68
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:30,960
-Are you okay?
-Of course I'm okay.

69
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:32,879
Have you seen this place?

70
00:03:32,962 --> 00:03:36,466
An island
full of technological monstrosities,

71
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:38,551
each more deadly than the next?

72
00:03:38,635 --> 00:03:40,303
It's paradise.

73
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:44,641
Yeah, um, glad you're having fun,
but we're kind of here to rescue you?

74
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:47,435
Rescue me? Did I not just rescue you?

75
00:03:47,518 --> 00:03:49,062
Yeah, that didn't go as planned.

76
00:03:49,145 --> 00:03:51,022
We came to bring you back.

77
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:54,192
We would've come sooner,
but we had no idea you were here.

78
00:03:54,275 --> 00:03:56,027
We thought you were still with Hordak.

79
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:58,988
Scorpia told us what happened.

80
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:02,283
She and the other princesses
are waiting for you at Bright Moon.

81
00:04:02,408 --> 00:04:03,660
[all shouting]

82
00:04:07,538 --> 00:04:09,123
Entrapta, please.

83
00:04:09,207 --> 00:04:10,333
We need your help.

84
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:13,002
We discovered what the First Ones
were doing to Etheria,

85
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:15,672
a terrible secret that no one else knows.

86
00:04:15,838 --> 00:04:17,257
You mean the Heart of Etheria?

87
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:18,883
Why didn't you say so?

88
00:04:44,033 --> 00:04:47,829
Sorry. We didn't know you were in here.
We'll just come back later.

89
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:49,706
Wait.

90
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:54,627
What's the report from the field?

91
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:58,131
We just got back
from conquering another Rebel town.

92
00:04:58,256 --> 00:05:01,050
The third one this week.
So, you're welcome.

93
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:03,553
Ah, you should've seen us. I was all:

94
00:05:03,636 --> 00:05:05,221
[mimicking gunshots]

95
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:06,681
And then Rogelio, he was like:

96
00:05:06,764 --> 00:05:08,016
[roaring]

97
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:10,351
-Woo-hoo!
-Watch it!

98
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:14,022
Calm down, Catra.

99
00:05:14,105 --> 00:05:16,482
It's not like Scorpia needs it anymore.

100
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:19,235
You don't get to talk to me like that.

101
00:05:19,777 --> 00:05:21,571
I'm your commander. Got it?

102
00:05:21,654 --> 00:05:24,073
What is wrong with you? We're winning.

103
00:05:24,282 --> 00:05:25,533
Even you should be happy.

104
00:05:26,117 --> 00:05:26,951
Happy?

105
00:05:28,453 --> 00:05:32,457
I'll be happy when the Rebellion
and She-Ra are gone for good.

106
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:34,125
But that's never going to happen

107
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:36,919
with the three of you goofing off
all the time.

108
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:38,171
You are pathetic!

109
00:05:44,052 --> 00:05:45,386
Stay away from her!

110
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:49,557
We used to be your friends.
Why are you treating us like this?

111
00:05:53,394 --> 00:05:54,687
Get out!

112
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:07,158
[Double Trouble] Ouch.

113
00:06:08,701 --> 00:06:11,287
It's worse than I thought. You're a mess.

114
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:13,956
Double Trouble? You came back.

115
00:06:14,332 --> 00:06:15,917
I mean, where were you?

116
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,461
-I thought, um--
-You thought I left you?

117
00:06:19,587 --> 00:06:23,716
Apologies for the delay, kitten.
I got held up in Bright Moon.

118
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:27,095
But don't worry, I brought something
that might cheer you up.

119
00:06:27,178 --> 00:06:29,430
Better be something good after all that.

120
00:06:29,514 --> 00:06:33,142
The time to strike the final blow
to the Rebellion is upon us.

121
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:36,646
The princesses aren't getting along,
and most deliciously,

122
00:06:37,188 --> 00:06:39,732
She-Ra is gone.

123
00:06:40,316 --> 00:06:42,819
-So...
-Bright Moon is unprotected.

124
00:06:43,486 --> 00:06:45,613
Told you it would cheer you up.

125
00:06:48,324 --> 00:06:51,119
We must find Double Trouble at once.
They know too much.

126
00:06:51,202 --> 00:06:53,454
We can't let them return
to the Fright Zone.

127
00:06:53,538 --> 00:06:56,541
Forget Double Trouble.
They don't matter anymore.

128
00:06:56,624 --> 00:06:58,876
The only person we need is right here.

129
00:06:59,001 --> 00:07:01,212
Scorpia is not a true princess.

130
00:07:01,295 --> 00:07:04,298
She has never shown any connection
to her Runestone.

131
00:07:04,465 --> 00:07:07,718
But she will.
As soon as we get her to the Black Garnet.

132
00:07:08,177 --> 00:07:10,513
Get her to the Black Garnet?

133
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:13,474
Your Majesty,
you're not thinking this through.

134
00:07:13,558 --> 00:07:15,518
You cannot go to the Fright Zone now.

135
00:07:15,601 --> 00:07:19,647
You are without allies,
without your prisoner, and without a plan.

136
00:07:20,022 --> 00:07:21,774
[scoffs] I have a plan.

137
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:24,527
My queen, listen to me.

138
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:28,030
Think. Have I not only tried to help you?

139
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:31,784
You are letting your emotions
get the better of you.

140
00:07:31,868 --> 00:07:34,328
This plan is too risky.

141
00:07:35,705 --> 00:07:38,791
What would your mother say
if she were here?

142
00:07:40,168 --> 00:07:43,212
You don't get to talk to me
about my mother.

143
00:07:43,754 --> 00:07:47,133
Besides, you were the one who told me
to decide what kind of queen I am,

144
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:48,551
and I've decided.

145
00:07:48,926 --> 00:07:51,846
I'm the queen who's going to save Etheria.

146
00:07:56,434 --> 00:07:57,477
My queen.

147
00:08:00,897 --> 00:08:02,482
[woman] All right. Move out.

148
00:08:02,565 --> 00:08:04,692
[man] You heard Catra. Head for the woods.

149
00:08:04,775 --> 00:08:06,569
-[woman] Let's go.
-[man] Go, go, go!

150
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:07,904
Move, people!

151
00:08:08,863 --> 00:08:10,573
[Hordak] What is the meaning of this?

152
00:08:10,656 --> 00:08:13,451
Oh, sorry. I thought you wanted to defeat
the Rebellion.

153
00:08:13,534 --> 00:08:16,245
Because this is what that looks like.

154
00:08:16,412 --> 00:08:20,333
We are already spread thin
from occupying so much territory.

155
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:22,168
We're occupying plenty.

156
00:08:22,251 --> 00:08:24,378
But not Bright Moon. Not yet.

157
00:08:24,545 --> 00:08:26,172
Double Trouble reported in.

158
00:08:26,255 --> 00:08:29,717
The princesses are in chaos,
She-Ra is gone,

159
00:08:29,884 --> 00:08:33,513
and without their precious hero
to protect the castle, well...

160
00:08:33,888 --> 00:08:36,599
We can strike the final blow
to the Rebellion.

161
00:08:37,683 --> 00:08:41,604
When Bright Moon falls,
we will control all of Etheria.

162
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:44,732
Big brother's gonna be so impressed.

163
00:08:44,815 --> 00:08:45,816
Yes.

164
00:08:46,067 --> 00:08:49,278
This will show him what I am capable of.

165
00:08:50,154 --> 00:08:52,406
What we are capable of.

166
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:54,951
Good work, Catra.

167
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:58,329
Victory is ours.

168
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:07,922
[Entrapta laughing]

169
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:11,968
[signal droning]

170
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:20,977
I don't like it here.
The signal, it's getting louder again.

171
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:22,311
I think we should go.

172
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:25,314
The talking horse is right.
We should stay away.

173
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:28,401
No one ever comes back
from this part of the island.

174
00:09:28,484 --> 00:09:30,820
Don't worry about the signal.
It's better inside.

175
00:09:30,903 --> 00:09:33,739
-Inside where? Wha...?
-[shouts]

176
00:09:33,823 --> 00:09:35,825
Somewhere.

177
00:09:37,118 --> 00:09:37,994
Aha!

178
00:09:39,036 --> 00:09:40,997
Ta-da!

179
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:47,295
Come on, you're gonna love it.

180
00:09:52,883 --> 00:09:55,845
Wow, this place is terrible.

181
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:57,096
I hate it.

182
00:09:57,179 --> 00:09:59,056
It's a First Ones Temple.

183
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:00,891
Isn't it amazing?

184
00:10:00,975 --> 00:10:05,354
The First Ones tried to hide their secrets
by dumping them on Beast Island.

185
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:08,816
The answers I've been looking for,
they're all here.

186
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:13,654
[machine powering up]

187
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:21,996
My theories were correct.
I knew the First Ones

188
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:25,249
had retrofitted the planet with tech,
I just didn't know why.

189
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:26,959
But it all makes sense now.

190
00:10:27,043 --> 00:10:30,379
They were mining the planet's magic,
using it to power their weapon,

191
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:32,340
the Heart of Etheria.

192
00:10:32,423 --> 00:10:35,801
But of course you know
all about the Heart of Etheria already,

193
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:39,305
-seeing as you're a part of it.
-Wait, wait, hang on. What?

194
00:10:39,388 --> 00:10:40,556
I'm a part of it?

195
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,351
All the princesses are.
Hang on, I'll show you.

196
00:10:48,522 --> 00:10:51,192
The Heart draws its power
from the magic of the princesses.

197
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:54,654
It needs all their Runestones engaged
for it to work.

198
00:10:54,737 --> 00:10:57,823
And She-Ra is the most important piece,
the key.

199
00:10:57,907 --> 00:11:00,618
She channels the weapon's power
and focuses it.

200
00:11:00,701 --> 00:11:01,744
What?

201
00:11:03,287 --> 00:11:05,873
[Entrapta]
She-Ra is the only being strong enough

202
00:11:05,956 --> 00:11:08,793
to withstand the destructive energy
of the Heart.

203
00:11:08,876 --> 00:11:12,838
So, the First Ones made the sword
to control her, to use her.

204
00:11:14,882 --> 00:11:19,345
When the Heart is deployed,
She-Ra will raise the sword and fire it!

205
00:11:19,929 --> 00:11:21,555
[Entrapta laughing]

206
00:11:22,973 --> 00:11:26,102
She-Ra is the key.

207
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:27,812
That means I can stop it, right?

208
00:11:27,895 --> 00:11:30,981
If She-Ra fires the weapon,
then I just won't do it.

209
00:11:31,065 --> 00:11:34,151
Please, Entrapta, tell me I can stop it.

210
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:37,154
Once the planet is balanced,
no one can stop it.

211
00:11:37,905 --> 00:11:41,117
Not even the First Ones could control it.
That's why they left.

212
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,453
When the weapon is activated
it will channel all its power into you.

213
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:46,372
You don't get to refuse.

214
00:11:58,592 --> 00:12:01,554
But Etheria isn't balanced yet. Look.

215
00:12:01,637 --> 00:12:05,558
There's still one Runestone offline.
We might still have a chance.

216
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:07,393
Wait.

217
00:12:08,477 --> 00:12:10,229
The Black Garnet.

218
00:12:10,312 --> 00:12:11,564
Scorpia.

219
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:15,067
Scorpia's with the Rebellion.
You think Glimmer would--?

220
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:18,863
There's no way she could know
that Scorpia's the final piece.

221
00:12:19,697 --> 00:12:21,615
We have to get back to Bright Moon.

222
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:26,620
Scorpia. We need to go
to the Black Garnet chamber now.

223
00:12:26,704 --> 00:12:28,205
My plan is going to work.

224
00:12:39,341 --> 00:12:43,137
What's wrong?
I thought you would want to be a princess.

225
00:12:44,972 --> 00:12:49,477
Okay, I have been considering,
and I really appreciate the offer,

226
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:52,271
but I only came here to help Entrapta.

227
00:12:52,521 --> 00:12:55,941
I left the Horde,
but I'm not gonna betray them.

228
00:12:56,025 --> 00:12:58,819
-Or Catra.
-This will save them.

229
00:12:59,069 --> 00:13:01,530
Horde Prime could be here at any moment.

230
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:04,366
If he shows up
and we're not ready to defend ourselves,

231
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:05,868
everyone loses.

232
00:13:05,951 --> 00:13:08,996
Do you really think
he'll need to keep Catra around?

233
00:13:14,335 --> 00:13:18,923
We both want to save the people we love.
But I can't do it without you.

234
00:13:19,757 --> 00:13:20,841
It's hopeless.

235
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:23,928
What if the Black Garnet doesn't want me?
I just...

236
00:13:24,887 --> 00:13:26,597
I kind of get rejected a lot.

237
00:13:27,306 --> 00:13:28,516
Tell me about it.

238
00:13:28,599 --> 00:13:30,267
My best friends left me.

239
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:34,772
Even before this, I was the weak princess,
the one who had to recharge.

240
00:13:34,855 --> 00:13:35,773
Who didn't fit.

241
00:13:36,857 --> 00:13:39,068
But that's changed now.

242
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:40,903
We've changed now.

243
00:13:40,986 --> 00:13:43,155
We're stronger than anyone knows.

244
00:13:43,239 --> 00:13:44,490
We can do this.

245
00:13:44,573 --> 00:13:46,659
We can save everyone.

246
00:13:47,076 --> 00:13:48,077
Everyone?

247
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:51,205
You're not hopeless.
You were born for this.

248
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:54,208
And I'll help you. We're in this together.

249
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:56,919
You're gonna make a great princess.

250
00:13:58,420 --> 00:13:59,338
[grunts]

251
00:14:01,549 --> 00:14:03,717
Sorry. That was probably too much.

252
00:14:04,426 --> 00:14:05,928
Oh, wow, still going.

253
00:14:08,138 --> 00:14:09,890
[clearing throat]

254
00:14:10,849 --> 00:14:13,102
I'm in. So, what now?

255
00:14:13,185 --> 00:14:15,896
Now, we go save the world.

256
00:14:19,149 --> 00:14:21,735
-What's going on? Is Glimmer in danger?
-She might be.

257
00:14:21,819 --> 00:14:23,737
We have to get back as soon as we can.

258
00:14:23,821 --> 00:14:27,616
We're going home now? That's great. Wait.
Should I bring something back for Glimmer?

259
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:30,703
-What does she like? Does she like bugs?
-Oh, Micah.

260
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:32,371
No one likes bugs.

261
00:14:32,454 --> 00:14:34,915
Have a good trip. Come again soon.

262
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:39,670
Entrapta, no. You're coming with us.

263
00:14:45,175 --> 00:14:48,762
[Entrapta]
This place, it's pure information.

264
00:14:50,347 --> 00:14:54,560
Everything I've ever dreamed of knowing
about the planet, it's all here.

265
00:14:54,643 --> 00:14:56,437
So, I'm staying.

266
00:14:56,520 --> 00:15:00,274
-We're not going to leave you.
-[signal droning]

267
00:15:02,651 --> 00:15:04,653
Oh, this is not good.

268
00:15:05,237 --> 00:15:10,492
Everything back there with the princesses
and then with Hordak

269
00:15:10,826 --> 00:15:13,621
was so confusing.

270
00:15:14,121 --> 00:15:16,790
I just wasn't suited for friendship.

271
00:15:16,874 --> 00:15:18,250
I belong here.

272
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:24,882
Entrapta, please! Fight it!

273
00:15:27,009 --> 00:15:27,843
[shouts]

274
00:15:33,265 --> 00:15:35,476
For the honor of Grayskull!

275
00:15:39,396 --> 00:15:40,940
Head for the ship!

276
00:15:45,694 --> 00:15:46,904
This way!

277
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:51,450
[both gasping]

278
00:15:51,575 --> 00:15:52,993
[chittering]

279
00:15:57,289 --> 00:15:59,041
Just leave me!

280
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:00,918
[roaring]

281
00:16:26,443 --> 00:16:27,695
Hey!

282
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:39,873
[roaring]

283
00:16:39,957 --> 00:16:41,500
[all shouting]

284
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:08,152
[Bow] Entrapta, no!

285
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:11,530
The island is affecting you.
You can't give in.

286
00:17:11,613 --> 00:17:14,950
You don't understand.
That's okay. No one understands me.

287
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:18,746
I tried to be a good friend.
I didn't understand that either.

288
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:21,373
What? Did you think friendship was easy?

289
00:17:21,457 --> 00:17:23,959
It takes work to be there
for other people.

290
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:25,669
It takes everything you've got.

291
00:17:25,753 --> 00:17:29,840
Everyone leaves me behind.
Why should it be any different now?

292
00:17:29,923 --> 00:17:33,260
Because we're not ever
going to leave you behind again!

293
00:17:33,343 --> 00:17:37,014
And we never gave up on you,
even when you were with the Horde.

294
00:17:37,097 --> 00:17:39,058
Because that's what friends do.

295
00:17:39,141 --> 00:17:41,602
You haven't given up on me?

296
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:46,482
We're out of time.

297
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:49,943
Entrapta, we flew here
on an ancient First Ones ship.

298
00:17:50,027 --> 00:17:51,653
Do you wanna see it or not?

299
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:54,573
A ship? You have a First Ones spacecraft?

300
00:17:54,656 --> 00:17:57,159
A First Ones spacecraft that works?
[shouts]

301
00:17:57,242 --> 00:17:58,452
I wanna see!

302
00:17:58,535 --> 00:18:02,456
Uh, hate to interrupt, but there's
more monsters coming. [chuckles]

303
00:18:02,539 --> 00:18:03,791
Like, a lot more!

304
00:18:03,874 --> 00:18:05,459
[monsters roaring]

305
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:07,586
[whistles]

306
00:18:13,717 --> 00:18:18,555
Did anything I said about friendship
work for you or was it all the ship?

307
00:18:18,639 --> 00:18:21,850
Oh, definitely the ship. But thank you.

308
00:18:22,267 --> 00:18:24,812
I'm-- I'm glad we're friends.

309
00:18:27,231 --> 00:18:29,191
Guys, we really gotta go.

310
00:18:29,274 --> 00:18:30,192
To the ship!

311
00:18:31,985 --> 00:18:32,986
Get them, girl!

312
00:18:33,153 --> 00:18:35,489
I'll be back for you, I promise.

313
00:18:36,698 --> 00:18:37,950
[droning]

314
00:18:48,627 --> 00:18:49,628
Hmm.

315
00:18:55,467 --> 00:18:56,552
[grunting]

316
00:18:56,635 --> 00:18:57,845
You got me.

317
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:04,935
Ugh. I know, I know.

318
00:19:05,018 --> 00:19:08,188
No one is welcome
in Hordak's super-secret sanctum.

319
00:19:08,272 --> 00:19:10,482
Not since you let that princess in.

320
00:19:12,442 --> 00:19:13,402
[groans]

321
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:17,990
What makes something a sanctum, anyway?

322
00:19:21,702 --> 00:19:22,619
No small talk?

323
00:19:23,036 --> 00:19:26,915
I thought I'd at least get
a pat on the back for my daring escape.

324
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:29,585
It's too bad, though.

325
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:32,337
I was looking forward
to meeting this Entrapta character

326
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:33,797
before I left Bright Moon.

327
00:19:33,881 --> 00:19:36,758
But of course, as you know,
she wasn't there.

328
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:39,511
What did you say?

329
00:19:39,595 --> 00:19:42,431
Oh, you don't need to keep up
the charade with me.

330
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:43,932
I figured out the truth.

331
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:46,560
You had Catra send Entrapta
to Beast Island,

332
00:19:46,643 --> 00:19:49,104
so She-Ra would run off to rescue her.

333
00:19:49,313 --> 00:19:50,522
A brilliant idea.

334
00:19:50,606 --> 00:19:52,441
The perfect distraction.

335
00:19:52,524 --> 00:19:55,903
I have to applaud your work,
you really had me going.

336
00:19:56,069 --> 00:19:58,822
So scorned by Entrapta's betrayal.

337
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:03,076
Even now you look like you had no idea.

338
00:20:05,329 --> 00:20:06,663
Brava.

339
00:20:06,747 --> 00:20:09,625
I mean, I did consider the alternative,

340
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:12,628
that Catra's been lying to you
this whole time.

341
00:20:13,295 --> 00:20:16,423
That she made you think
she was your partner in crime,

342
00:20:16,506 --> 00:20:19,134
while really she is the one
who betrayed you.

343
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:24,514
But between you and me,
there's no way she's that good an actor.

344
00:20:25,015 --> 00:20:26,391
Well, I'll leave you to it.

345
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:29,102
Congrats again. Great work all around.

346
00:20:36,193 --> 00:20:37,569
[shouting]

347
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:51,750
Hello!

348
00:20:52,376 --> 00:20:55,212
It's the most beautiful thing
I've ever seen. How does it work?

349
00:20:55,295 --> 00:20:57,839
What does this button do?
I'm gonna push it and find out!

350
00:20:57,923 --> 00:20:59,132
[shouts] Mm.

351
00:20:59,216 --> 00:21:00,968
Take us home to Bright Moon.

352
00:21:02,219 --> 00:21:05,264
Huh? This is actually real?

353
00:21:05,347 --> 00:21:08,225
Yes. Remember
we did the pinching thing already?

354
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:11,270
Well, still,
I couldn't let myself believe--

355
00:21:11,478 --> 00:21:12,396
It's all true?

356
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:14,731
We're really going home?

357
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:17,818
And this horse really talks?

358
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:25,867
Too easy.

359
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:27,703
As usual.

360
00:21:33,583 --> 00:21:34,751
Are you ready?

361
00:21:37,838 --> 00:21:39,047
Not really.

362
00:21:48,223 --> 00:21:49,224
Bright Moon.

363
00:21:49,933 --> 00:21:51,518
I'm really home.

364
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,521
Glimmer!

365
00:21:54,604 --> 00:21:56,440
Glimmer, where are you?

366
00:21:58,775 --> 00:22:00,402
[Shadow Weaver] She's gone.

367
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:03,113
Micah?

368
00:22:03,196 --> 00:22:05,365
Is it really you?

369
00:22:09,077 --> 00:22:12,039
-What is this traitor doing here?
-Where's Glimmer?

370
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:17,461
Hordak, you wanted to talk to me?

371
00:22:19,087 --> 00:22:23,467
Come on, I don't have time for this.
Our troops are moving out as we speak.

372
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:26,178
-If there's something you need, you can--

373
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:31,433
[shouts]

374
00:22:36,646 --> 00:22:39,858
Hello, Force Captain.

375
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:43,820
