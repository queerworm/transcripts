So, let me make sure I get this right.
Catra saved you from Horde Prime.

00:00:33,408 --> 00:00:34,951
Like "Catra" Catra?

5
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:38,413
Why would she do that?
It doesn't make any sense.

6
00:00:38,496 --> 00:00:41,583
She said she wanted to do
one good thing in her life.

7
00:00:42,292 --> 00:00:44,294

about what happened on Etheria.

11

About what I said.

12
00:00:58,641 --> 00:00:59,476
What I did.

13

Adora, I'm so sorry for everything I said.

You were right about everything.

21
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:31,800
I should have just listened to you.
I didn't know if I'd ever see you again

-Hey, hey, it's okay. We're here now.

33
00:01:57,117 --> 00:01:59,160
I mean, why are we lurching?

34
00:01:59,536 --> 00:02:01,704

35
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:04,290
<i>-We're running on empty.</i>
<i>-But not to worry.</i>

36
00:02:04,374 --> 00:02:06,709

{\an8}You know, so just, uh, protecting us
from any bots Horde Prime might send.

61
00:03:19,115 --> 00:03:22,368
Uh-huh. Like you were the night before,
the night before that,

62
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:25,079
and basically every night
since Adora left?

63
00:03:28,374 --> 00:03:30,877
I can take over if you want?
It's getting pretty late.

No. That's okay.

00:03:32,921 --> 00:03:35,715
Uh... I was kind of
in the middle of something.

66
00:03:35,798 --> 00:03:37,634
Ooh, what is it?

67
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:39,969
It's nothing. You'd laugh at me.

68
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:43,806
I would never.
You can tell me. I'm great with secrets.

69
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:46,351
Like, one time, Kyle told me
he had a crush on Rogel...

70
00:03:46,434 --> 00:03:49,312
Yeah, uh... Never mind.
I didn't say anything. What?

71
00:03:49,395 --> 00:03:51,314
Anyway, I'm a vault for secrets.

72
00:03:53,524 --> 00:03:56,903
I've had this connection to She-Ra.
Our sacred bond.

73
00:03:56,986 --> 00:03:59,489
And, yeah, I know She-Ra's gone,

74
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:02,533
but I thought maybe I could still connect
to Adora.

75
00:04:03,034 --> 00:04:05,245
Talk to her,
fill her in on what's been going on.

76
00:04:05,328 --> 00:04:06,871
Oh! Tell her I say hi.

77
00:04:06,955 --> 00:04:09,958
That's the problem.
I haven't been able to feel her.

78

hoping it might be Mara's ship,
and sending a daily report, but...

80
00:04:17,632 --> 00:04:19,592
I bet you just haven't picked
the right one.

81
00:04:19,676 --> 00:04:22,136
Do you think that's them?
Or wait. What about that one?

82
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:23,596
No, never mind, that's a moon.

83
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,807
How about that one? No. Also a moon.

84
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:28,935

how many moons we have here? It's weird.

00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:36,234

-With all the crystals?
-Correct.

88
00:04:39,362 --> 00:04:41,406
So, then where are the crystals?

89
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:47,453
Well, Darla's sensors say
the crystals are on this planet,

90
00:04:47,537 --> 00:04:51,749
and Darla would never lie to me.
So, they've gotta be here somewhere.

They're the first wave
of Horde Prime's invasion.

95

It's what he's doing to Etheria right now.

96
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:05,680
This planet, he destroyed it.

97
00:05:05,847 --> 00:05:07,890
That's what he's doing to Etheria?

98
00:05:08,016 --> 00:05:10,768
This is all my fault.
Horde Prime only found us because--

99
00:05:10,852 --> 00:05:13,771
Because you activated
the Heart of Etheria.

102
00:05:20,278 --> 00:05:22,947
Entrapta's right,
those crystals must be here somewhere.

103
00:05:23,197 --> 00:05:26,409
-We'll have to find them on foot.
-I'll get to work prepping Darla

104
00:05:26,492 --> 00:05:29,162
for new crystals, removing the old ones.
They're ancient.

105
00:05:29,245 --> 00:05:31,456
It's a miracle they lasted this long.

106
00:05:31,539 --> 00:05:33,791
They must've fused with her engines
by now.

107
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:37,295
Oh, it must be so painful for her.

108
00:05:37,462 --> 00:05:38,713
[Darla]<i> I do not feel pain.</i>

109
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:40,590
Okay, good luck finding the crystals.

110
00:05:40,673 --> 00:05:44,719

Or any colors.

119

That's okay. We'll find them.

Well, Bow missed you so much.

But he was really hurt by everything you--

127

By everything that happened.
I think he was so focused on finding you,

128

he never actually worked through
all his stuff.

00:06:28,304 --> 00:06:29,639
Well, what do I do?

130
00:06:30,014 --> 00:06:32,266
There has to be a way to fix it.

We'll have to find another way down.

171
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:32,887
[Swift Wind] <i>Everyone was pretty on edge.</i>
<i>That's when Sea Hawk got an idea.</i>

172
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:35,932
<i>"Morale-boosting adventure!"</i>

173
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:38,226
[Swift Wind] <i>It didn't go well.</i>

174
00:08:38,935 --> 00:08:40,394
<i>"Make it stop."</i>

175
00:08:40,728 --> 00:08:42,772
[Swift Wind] <i>At all. It was terrible.</i>

176
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:45,233
<i>It's one of the worst things</i>
<i>I've ever seen.</i>

177
00:08:45,316 --> 00:08:46,150
[laughs]

178
00:08:47,235 --> 00:08:48,236
[sighs]

179
00:08:48,319 --> 00:08:49,987
Anyway, hope space is fun.

180
00:08:50,071 --> 00:08:52,406
And that you're getting these.
It's just, uh...

181
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:55,785
[chuckles] I know the others think
this is useless.

182
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:58,663
I know.
They try to be supportive, but I see it.

183
00:08:58,746 --> 00:09:01,707
So, if you could just give me a sign
you're hearing this...

184
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:03,918
[sighs]

185
00:09:04,001 --> 00:09:05,336
Come home soon, Adora.

186
00:09:05,586 --> 00:09:06,420
We need you.

187
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:08,422
[♪♪♪]

188
00:09:13,344 --> 00:09:14,345
[gasps]

189
00:09:18,474 --> 00:09:19,308
Hello?

190
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:22,019
[whooshing]

191
00:09:24,105 --> 00:09:25,064
[grunts]

192
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:26,774
Haa!

193
00:09:27,275 --> 00:09:28,234
-Wait!
-Intruder!

194
00:09:28,526 --> 00:09:30,528
-Wait, wait, I just--
-Who are you?

195
00:09:30,611 --> 00:09:32,905
-Why are you following us?
-Why are you hitting me?

196
00:09:33,114 --> 00:09:35,408
-Answer the questions!
-You first!

197
00:09:36,033 --> 00:09:38,160
-Are you with the Horde?
-No way!

198
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:40,580
Whoa!

199
00:09:40,788 --> 00:09:42,498
We're only here for the fuel.

200
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:45,668
After that, we're getting as far away
from Horde Prime as possible.

201
00:09:46,294 --> 00:09:47,670
Are you with the Horde?

202
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:49,005
[Adora] No. I mean--

203
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:51,507
[grunts]

204
00:09:51,716 --> 00:09:54,302
I was, but I'm not anymore.
It's complicated, okay?

205
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:55,803
What's complicated?

206
00:09:56,012 --> 00:09:57,388
[whistling]

207
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:58,681
[gasps]

208
00:09:59,515 --> 00:10:02,393
-Do you serve Horde Prime or not?
-No! Do you?

209
00:10:02,643 --> 00:10:04,228
-No!
-[grunts]

210
00:10:04,312 --> 00:10:06,230
Then we're all on the same side.

211
00:10:06,314 --> 00:10:08,816
Can we please stop hitting each other now?

212
00:10:12,987 --> 00:10:13,946
-[yells]
-Glimmer!

213
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:16,198
[both panting]

214
00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:17,700
Sorry.

215
00:10:19,785 --> 00:10:22,246
You should be more careful
now that you can't teleport.

216
00:10:23,205 --> 00:10:24,749
I really miss teleporting.

217
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:28,753
Remember when I finally learned
how to use my powers?

218
00:10:28,919 --> 00:10:31,130
We teleported everywhere.

219
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:34,383
-Bright Moon, Mystacor...
-Castaspella hated it.

220
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:37,678
But we'd always teleport away
just when she was about to catch us.

221
00:10:37,762 --> 00:10:38,596
[laughs]

222
00:10:39,263 --> 00:10:40,306
[Glimmer sighs]

223
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:43,601
[Bow] That was forever ago.

224
00:10:43,851 --> 00:10:45,478
A lot's changed since then.

225
00:10:45,853 --> 00:10:47,021
Uh... um...

226
00:10:47,855 --> 00:10:48,689
Yeah.

227
00:10:49,857 --> 00:10:50,775
I guess it has.

228
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:55,029
[hoots then chirps]

229
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:08,084
Do you want any?

230
00:11:08,209 --> 00:11:09,585
I'm Starla, by the way.

231
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:12,838
This my bird, Glory,
my sister Tallstar, my brother--

232
00:11:12,922 --> 00:11:17,885
Starla, you can't just offer
every stranger that shows up our food.

233
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:19,553
It's one person.

234
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:22,056
Besides, we have plenty to share.

235
00:11:22,139 --> 00:11:23,974
-[gulping]
-[chuckles]

236
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:27,937
[clears throat]

237
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:28,854
Sorry.

238
00:11:28,979 --> 00:11:29,814
And thanks.

239
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:32,691
-I'm Adora.
-Jewelstar. And it doesn't matter.

240
00:11:32,775 --> 00:11:35,152
Once we get the thulite crystals,
we're blasting off,

241
00:11:35,236 --> 00:11:36,779
and rations won't be a problem.

242
00:11:36,987 --> 00:11:40,241
The pink crystals?
That's why my friends and I are here.

243
00:11:40,324 --> 00:11:42,660
Yeah, but they're impossible to get to.

244
00:11:42,743 --> 00:11:44,995
-Stashed away--
-In the center of this cave that--

245
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:47,206
-Is falling apart because of--
-Earthquakes?

246
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:50,751
We're stranded until we can get them.

247
00:11:51,001 --> 00:11:52,837
We can't be stuck here. There's no time.

248
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:56,841
Horde Prime invaded Etheria.
I have to stop him before he takes it.

249
00:11:56,924 --> 00:11:59,718
If he's on your planet, it's already over.

250
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:03,848
This place used to be a safe harbor
for travelers across the galaxy.

251
00:12:04,181 --> 00:12:05,975
<i>Then Horde Prime arrived.</i>

252
00:12:06,267 --> 00:12:10,479
Now we're just scavenging the remains.
Same as he did to our home world.

253
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:11,897
[sniffling]

254
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:15,484
If you're smart, you'll run away.
Far, far away.

255
00:12:15,609 --> 00:12:17,987
-Like we're trying to do.
-Well, I'm not.

256
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:20,406
Running away, that is. I am smart.

257
00:12:20,823 --> 00:12:21,657
Never mind.

258
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:24,994
Look, I'm a part of a rebellion,
fighting the Horde.

259
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:27,121
Once my friends find me and we get fuel,

260
00:12:27,288 --> 00:12:29,415
I'm gonna face Prime,
and I'm gonna stop him.

261
00:12:29,498 --> 00:12:30,916
Wow! Really?

262
00:12:32,793 --> 00:12:35,212
Really. Why don't you help us fight back?

263
00:12:35,337 --> 00:12:37,756
You've got the tech and the weapons, wh--

264
00:12:37,882 --> 00:12:40,009
You could do so much more
than just scavenge.

265
00:12:40,092 --> 00:12:41,218
-You could--
-Get killed?

266
00:12:41,469 --> 00:12:43,512
Prime has already taken our home.

267
00:12:43,721 --> 00:12:46,891
Do you think we'd be on this wreck
of a planet if we had a choice?

268
00:12:47,057 --> 00:12:49,226
Horde Prime always wins.

269
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:50,436
He's unstoppable.

270
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:53,481
And you're just one girl with a stick.
What could you possibly do?

271
00:12:53,898 --> 00:12:57,193
Well, I used to be stronger.
But that doesn't matter.

272
00:12:57,318 --> 00:13:00,571
If everyone works together,
I know we can take him down.

273
00:13:00,863 --> 00:13:03,199
He has to pay for what he did, and he--

274
00:13:04,742 --> 00:13:07,161
He has someone on his ship. Someone I--

275
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:10,247
We're stopping him. Period.

276
00:13:10,831 --> 00:13:13,834
If your friend is with Prime,
it's already too late.

277
00:13:13,918 --> 00:13:15,753
Oh, no. Catra is not my friend.

278
00:13:15,836 --> 00:13:19,173
I mean, she's--
Used to be, but that was a long time ago,

279
00:13:19,256 --> 00:13:21,717
and she's tried to kill me
a bunch of times since then,

280
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:23,219
but then she saved Glimmer.

281
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:25,387
And maybe that means
there's still good in her,

282
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:28,098
and now I don't know. It's... [sighs]

283
00:13:28,182 --> 00:13:29,183
It's complicated.

284
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:32,561
Everything seems
really complicated with you.

285
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:35,397
Whatever she is, friend or not,
she's gone.

286
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:40,110
There's no point in going back for her.
No one stands up to Prime and survives.

287
00:13:40,194 --> 00:13:41,028
I'm sorry.

288
00:13:41,779 --> 00:13:43,280
[Glimmer] Bow, wait up!

289
00:13:43,405 --> 00:13:45,574
Bow! Would you please slow down?

290
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:47,451
I just wanna get back to the ship.

291
00:13:47,535 --> 00:13:48,410
[gasps]

292
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:50,746
It's all right. They're my friends.

293
00:13:51,038 --> 00:13:53,249
They don't sound like friends.

294
00:13:53,457 --> 00:13:56,252
-Are you guys--?
-We're fine. Who are the space pirates?

295
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:57,336
[rumbling]

296
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:00,089
[crystals shatter]

297
00:14:03,133 --> 00:14:05,010
These are the Star Siblings.

298
00:14:05,094 --> 00:14:08,472
They're after the same thing we are,
and we should all be working together.

299
00:14:08,556 --> 00:14:12,768
You know where the fuel crystals are,
and we can help. What do you say?

300
00:14:12,935 --> 00:14:14,311
-[Entrapta] Hello!
-[all gasp]

301
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:19,066
Okay. How many of you are there?

302
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:22,611
Several. Adora, I came as fast as I could
to warn you.

303
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:25,573
Darla's sensors indicate
that this planet is apparently a hotbed

304
00:14:25,656 --> 00:14:26,866
of seismic activity.

305
00:14:27,032 --> 00:14:28,951
Yeah, we kind of learned that
the hard way.

306
00:14:29,285 --> 00:14:31,996
Darla and I figured out an algorithm
to predict the tremors.

307
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:36,000
We're sort of running out of time
before the really big one hits.

308
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:39,044
So, are we getting the thulite now or...?

309
00:14:39,128 --> 00:14:41,213
Fine. We need to hurry. Let's go.

310
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:47,219
-Once we get to the cavern, you'll--
-Be awesome and hold the--

311
00:14:47,303 --> 00:14:49,763
Then Jewel will cover Glory and me
while we wing fling.

312
00:14:50,264 --> 00:14:51,557
Just absolutely not.

313
00:14:51,682 --> 00:14:53,183
You're saying you won't cover me?

314
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:55,227
You kind of have to.
You're my big brother.

315
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:57,104
Yeah, ouch, Jewel. Cold.

316
00:14:57,396 --> 00:15:00,733
No, just-- Of course I'll--
Just don't do anything fancy.

317
00:15:00,816 --> 00:15:02,234
Get the crystals and get out.

318
00:15:02,318 --> 00:15:04,278
-We don't want another--
-Eridani.

319
00:15:04,445 --> 00:15:05,446
Or Aquarii.

320
00:15:05,613 --> 00:15:08,198
-We should not have gotten fancy there.
-[Glory chirps]

321
00:15:08,657 --> 00:15:09,909
Uh! Think fast.

322
00:15:11,201 --> 00:15:13,120
-[laughs]
-[Jewelstar grunts]

323
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:16,332
-You guys are pretty close, huh?
-Yeah.

324
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:19,585
Growing up under the threat of Horde Prime
does that to you.

325
00:15:20,377 --> 00:15:23,130
We've lost a lot,
but we still have each other.

326
00:15:28,093 --> 00:15:28,928
Uh...

327
00:15:30,346 --> 00:15:31,180
[sighs]

328
00:15:37,478 --> 00:15:39,396
There it is. That's the thulite.

329
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:42,149
We have to get over that?

330
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:44,443
The chasm is wider
than last time we tried.

331
00:15:44,735 --> 00:15:47,947
It's getting worse.
This whole planet is falling apart.

332
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:52,409
Uh-uh... According to these readings,
there's gonna be another quake soon.

333
00:15:53,702 --> 00:15:56,747
A bridge! If we knock this column over
during the next quake,

334
00:15:56,872 --> 00:16:01,335
-we could bridge the gap and get across.
-It's risky, but it might work.

335
00:16:01,502 --> 00:16:02,711
Everyone, get ready.

336
00:16:05,214 --> 00:16:07,925
Three, two, one!

337
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,804
[all groaning]

338
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:17,393
[crash]

339
00:16:18,185 --> 00:16:19,311
Let's do this.

340
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:24,984
[gasps]

341
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:26,944
No! That's our only way out.

342
00:16:27,027 --> 00:16:27,861
No.

343
00:16:29,071 --> 00:16:30,364

344
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:34,326
[crystal shatters]

345
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,954
[gasps] What's happening?

346
00:16:38,872 --> 00:16:39,915
-Glimmer!
-[screams]

347
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:42,292
[Glimmer] Bow!

348
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:45,462
It won't hold! We need to turn back!

349
00:16:46,046 --> 00:16:46,922
[gasps]

350
00:16:49,049 --> 00:16:50,551
Jump! I'll catch you!

351
00:16:56,056 --> 00:16:56,890
We can't!

352
00:16:56,974 --> 00:16:58,225
This is our one shot.

353
00:16:58,308 --> 00:16:59,768
It's too dangerous!

354
00:16:59,935 --> 00:17:00,853
Please, Bow.

355
00:17:01,061 --> 00:17:03,188
Just trust me, okay?

356
00:17:11,196 --> 00:17:12,031
Ahh...!

357
00:17:14,408 --> 00:17:15,826
[groans]

358
00:17:19,621 --> 00:17:21,749

[grunts]

361
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:30,132
Your friend better hurry.

362
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:32,134
-[bleeping]
-Uh-oh!

363
00:17:32,217 --> 00:17:34,511
Uh-oh. What do you mean "uh-oh"?

364
00:17:35,095 --> 00:17:37,097
Slight hiccup in my calculations.

365
00:17:37,181 --> 00:17:40,017
The seismic activity is increasing faster
than anticipated.

366
00:17:40,267 --> 00:17:42,895
-What does that mean?
-We're out of time.

367
00:17:42,978 --> 00:17:46,398
They need to come back now
before this whole place breaks apart!

368
00:17:46,648 --> 00:17:47,608
You can do this.

369
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:55,074
[gasps]

370
00:17:58,702 --> 00:18:00,621
We need to get out of here, now!

371
00:18:08,295 --> 00:18:09,379
[gasps]

372
00:18:09,838 --> 00:18:11,715
Go! We're right behind you!

373
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:17,054
Glimmer.

[groans]

375
00:18:20,974 --> 00:18:22,434
There's no time!

376
00:18:22,518 --> 00:18:24,895
[groans] I can't hold it anymore.

377
00:18:25,479 --> 00:18:26,980
No! Hang on!

378
00:18:30,484 --> 00:18:31,527
[grunts]

379
00:18:35,572 --> 00:18:40,077
My friends are on the other side.
I am not going anywhere.

380
00:18:41,703 --> 00:18:44,289
I'm not leaving anyone behind.

381
00:18:44,915 --> 00:18:46,959

[♪♪♪]

384
00:18:58,554 --> 00:19:00,139
Was that magic?

385
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:05,060
She-Ra.

386
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:07,855
I think that was She-Ra.

387
00:19:08,188 --> 00:19:09,523
[rumbling]

388
00:19:10,858 --> 00:19:12,192
[yells]

389
00:19:19,241 --> 00:19:20,284
No!

390
00:19:25,038 --> 00:19:25,998
Ready to do something

391
00:19:26,081 --> 00:19:28,083
-that probably won't work?
-Always.

392
00:19:35,924 --> 00:19:37,176
[Glimmer screams]

393
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:38,760
[grunts]

394
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:43,473
Bow.

395
00:19:50,355 --> 00:19:51,857
Glimmer, are you okay?

396
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:54,985
Yeah. I'm okay.

397
00:19:58,363 --> 00:19:59,198
Come on.

398
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:01,200
[rumbling]

399
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:14,713
Wow! Oh! We did it.

400
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,215
We actually did it.

401
00:20:16,423 --> 00:20:17,257
[sighs]

402
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:19,927
[sighs]

403
00:20:26,934 --> 00:20:28,435
Did you see what she did?

404
00:20:29,186 --> 00:20:31,021
[all murmuring]

405
00:20:31,605 --> 00:20:33,357
Thank you for helping us get the fuel.

406
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,234
You Etherians are so reckless.

407
00:20:35,317 --> 00:20:36,610
-Stubborn.
-And brave.

408
00:20:36,985 --> 00:20:39,988
Magic hasn't been seen in the universe
in centuries.

409
00:20:40,113 --> 00:20:44,076
But what I saw you do, you might
actually be able to take on Prime.

410
00:20:44,284 --> 00:20:47,704
-And we want in.
-We've spent our whole lives running away.

411
00:20:47,788 --> 00:20:48,747
But not anymore.

412
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:51,208
We're going to fight Prime
and take back our home.

413
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:53,752
Then welcome to the Rebellion.

414
00:20:56,964 --> 00:20:58,674
[Darla]<i> Two light stores replenished.</i>

415
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:00,175
<i>Ship refueled.</i>

416
00:21:05,514 --> 00:21:08,267
Look, I know you're still mad at me.

417
00:21:08,684 --> 00:21:11,603
Maybe you'll be mad at me
for a really long time.

418
00:21:11,979 --> 00:21:12,854
I deserve it.

419
00:21:13,021 --> 00:21:13,855
And maybe--

420
00:21:14,564 --> 00:21:15,399
Maybe we'll--

421
00:21:15,816 --> 00:21:18,610
Maybe we'll never be friends
like we used to be.

422
00:21:19,319 --> 00:21:22,281
But I'm not going to
stop trying to make it better.

423
00:21:22,489 --> 00:21:24,992
I made a mistake
with the Heart of Etheria.

424
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:27,452
I should have listened to you,
and I'm sorry.

425
00:21:27,869 --> 00:21:31,123
You get to be mad,
for as long as you need to be.

426
00:21:31,665 --> 00:21:33,292
But I'm not going anywhere.

427
00:21:33,834 --> 00:21:36,086
And when you're ready, I'll be here.

428
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:44,094
Okay.

429
00:21:52,436 --> 00:21:54,104
Adora? Are you okay?

430
00:21:54,646 --> 00:21:56,315
Yeah. I just--

431
00:21:58,358 --> 00:22:01,528
Look, I know this is gonna sound crazy
and dangerous,

432
00:22:01,611 --> 00:22:05,407
and I know Catra was our enemy
and she's done a lot of bad things

433
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:07,451
and hurt a lot of people, but--

434
00:22:07,534 --> 00:22:09,077
You wanna go back for her.

435
00:22:09,286 --> 00:22:10,162
Mm-hm.

436
00:22:11,455 --> 00:22:14,499
I can't just leave her there.
I have to try.

437
00:22:15,751 --> 00:22:18,086
Catra sacrificed herself to save me.

438
00:22:18,503 --> 00:22:20,797
Whatever you need to do, I'm with you.

439
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:22,716
Then let's do this.

440
00:22:22,924 --> 00:22:24,468
Best Friend Squad style.

441
00:22:26,094 --> 00:22:27,220
[Adora and Glimmer sigh]

-Oh!

443
00:22:35,562 --> 00:22:38,523
-Oh! What is it? What's going on?
-I felt her.

444
00:22:38,815 --> 00:22:40,317
She-Ra is back.
