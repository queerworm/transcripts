00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:24,315
[Scorpia] Catra. Hey, Catra.

2
00:00:24,399 --> 00:00:25,608
Catra?

3
00:00:26,401 --> 00:00:29,821
{\an8}Boy, you are just as fast on sand
as everywhere else.

4
00:00:29,904 --> 00:00:30,864
{\an8}Whoo! Ha.

5
00:00:30,947 --> 00:00:32,782
{\an8}Now, what are we looking at?

6
00:00:35,368 --> 00:00:37,829
{\an8}I'm looking at the Crimson Waste.

7
00:00:37,912 --> 00:00:40,540
{\an8}The place Hordak sent me to die.

8
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:42,709
{\an8}I have no idea what you're doing

9
00:00:42,792 --> 00:00:45,336
{\an8}as the last thing I told you
was to leave me alone.

10
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:48,423
{\an8}I know. It was so noble of you.

11
00:00:48,506 --> 00:00:50,842
{\an8}You pushed me away in order to save me.

12
00:00:50,925 --> 00:00:53,511
{\an8}It just brought us closer together.
[chuckles]

13
00:00:53,887 --> 00:00:55,555
I'm not-- [groans]

14
00:00:55,638 --> 00:00:58,641
You know what? It doesn't matter.
Nothing matters anymore.

15
00:00:58,725 --> 00:01:00,226
You know what I see here?

16
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:03,104
All my hard work ignored
because of one mistake.

17
00:01:03,188 --> 00:01:06,357
My dreams turning to dust
in front of my eyes.

18
00:01:06,691 --> 00:01:09,819
But mainly I'm looking at that?

19
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:15,033
[squeals]

20
00:01:15,116 --> 00:01:16,701
Huh. Must be abandoned.

21
00:01:16,785 --> 00:01:20,246
According to Force Captain orientation,
the Crimson Waste is deserted.

22
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:23,208
Yeah. It better be.
I'm not in the mood to deal with--

23
00:01:24,876 --> 00:01:26,044
people.

24
00:01:26,878 --> 00:01:29,547
Or that information
could be completely wrong.

25
00:01:29,631 --> 00:01:33,510
Maybe I should have skipped orientation,
ha, ha, you know what I mean?

26
00:01:33,593 --> 00:01:35,970

-Of course Hordak is wrong.
-[creature spits]

38
00:02:15,468 --> 00:02:18,763
He's a shut-in who lives in his lab
and doesn't know how to do anything.

39
00:02:18,847 --> 00:02:20,473
Why am I surprised at this?

[growling]

44
00:02:34,863 --> 00:02:37,740
Hey, Catra, I'm not questioning
your leadership here,

45
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:41,327
but maybe we shouldn't pick on
the heavily armed crowd?

46
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:46,040
Oh, yeah? And what are they going to do?
Send me to die in the Crimson Waste?

47
00:02:46,124 --> 00:02:46,958
[gasps]

48
00:02:47,041 --> 00:02:51,671
-Would you look at that, I'm already here.
-[goon] Good riddance to that She-Ra girl.

49
00:02:52,213 --> 00:02:53,965
Are you kidding me?

50
00:02:54,048 --> 00:02:56,885
If I ever see that boy
or his sparkly friend,

51
00:02:56,968 --> 00:02:59,637
or that angry blonde one again,
I swear, I'll--

52
00:02:59,721 --> 00:03:01,806
[Catra clearing throat]
Which way did they go?

53
00:03:03,641 --> 00:03:04,517
Who are you?

54
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:07,604
You said there was a sparkly girl,
a boy with arrows, and a blonde.

55
00:03:07,687 --> 00:03:10,565
-Which way did they go?
-Buzz off, Kitty Kitty.

56
00:03:10,648 --> 00:03:13,359
What, are you too dumb
to understand a simple question?

57
00:03:13,443 --> 00:03:15,445
Just point, genius,
and I'll figure it out.

58
00:03:15,528 --> 00:03:17,947
-[clearing throat] Hey, Catra?
-What?

59
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:24,203
Last thing I remember, Hordak sent us here
to track down First Ones Tech, not Adora.

60
00:03:24,287 --> 00:03:26,581
So, why do we need to know
which way they're going?

61
00:03:26,664 --> 00:03:30,668
Because Adora and her friends
are always after the same thing we are.

62
00:03:30,752 --> 00:03:32,754
Of course they're
in the middle of nowhere.

63
00:03:32,837 --> 00:03:36,382
-She had the nerve--
-So, spit it out. Where are they going?

64
00:03:36,925 --> 00:03:39,594
There are only two rules
in the Crimson Waste.

65
00:03:39,677 --> 00:03:42,597
One, the strong make the rules.

66
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:43,806
[Catra laughing]

67
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:49,520
So, here's the thing. I've done this.

68
00:03:49,604 --> 00:03:52,190
The whole "threatening people" bit,
the intimidation.

69
00:03:52,273 --> 00:03:56,444
I've been there.
And I just don't care anymore.

70
00:03:57,779 --> 00:04:00,031
-Some people have a bad day.
-[screeching]

71
00:04:00,114 --> 00:04:02,700
I've had a bad life.

00:04:02,784 --> 00:04:05,370
If I want something, it's taken from me.

73
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:06,663
[grunting]

74
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:10,124
If I win a fight, I lose the war.

75
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:14,754
Threats only work on someone
who has something to lose.

76
00:04:15,338 --> 00:04:16,172
But me?

77
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:17,924

78
00:04:18,341 --> 00:04:20,260
I've already lost it all.

00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:22,887
You can't be any good at this,

80
00:04:22,971 --> 00:04:25,682
because you just let yourself
get distracted.

83
00:04:30,436 --> 00:04:31,729
what'll it be?

84
00:04:36,734 --> 00:04:41,114
[grunts] Hey, you know, we don't think
of you as an outsider at all.

85
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:43,408
You are okay with us.

86
00:04:43,992 --> 00:04:46,577
We'll take you
anywhere you wanna go, boss.

87
00:04:47,537 --> 00:04:48,830
[whistling]

88
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:52,875
Good.

89
00:04:55,086 --> 00:04:58,172
I can't believe I'm standing
in front of Mara's ship.

90
00:04:58,256 --> 00:04:59,882
How do you know this is Mara's?

91
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:02,010
Light Hope showed me Mara's ship crashing.

92
00:05:02,093 --> 00:05:04,178
Right before the stars disappeared.

93
00:05:04,262 --> 00:05:08,516
I don't know who Mara is, but that's
definitely the ship that says your name.

94
00:05:08,599 --> 00:05:12,979
-Wait. Says my name?
-Not Adora. It says She-Ra.

95
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:17,817
This is incredible. A First Ones ship?

96
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:20,486
This thing used to travel through space.

97
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:21,988
[shouts]

98
00:05:22,655 --> 00:05:25,700
Think of all
the amazing things it contains.

99
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:31,205
Or it could be empty.
That's an option, too.

100
00:05:34,792 --> 00:05:38,004
This can't be it.
Where's the message coming from then?

101
00:05:38,087 --> 00:05:39,714
Has this ship always been here?

102
00:05:39,797 --> 00:05:42,633
The Crimson Waste got hit
with the mother of all dust storms.

103
00:05:42,717 --> 00:05:45,511
And when it cleared, this was unearthed.

104
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:49,724
And then people stole everything
they could pry up and take.

105
00:05:49,807 --> 00:05:53,561
If they didn't want things stolen,
they should have bolted everything down.

106
00:05:53,644 --> 00:05:56,606
-Besides, no one comes here anymore.
-[chuckles]

107
00:05:56,689 --> 00:05:59,692
-Because there's nothing left to steal?
-Well, that.

108
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:00,985
And it's haunted.

109
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:04,822
-[She-Ra Mara] <i>She-Ra. Etheria. Gone.</i>

111
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:08,910
Where is that voice coming from?
And where's the door?

112
00:06:08,993 --> 00:06:11,996
This ship is massive
but this room is tiny.

113
00:06:13,414 --> 00:06:15,917
There has to be a door around somewhere.

114
00:06:20,379 --> 00:06:21,297
Hold on.

115
00:06:29,514 --> 00:06:30,473

00:06:49,992 --> 00:06:52,245
Oh, boy, you really had them going.

120
00:06:53,204 --> 00:06:56,833
I've never seen a room of murderous toughs
look so freaked out before.

121
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:59,085
It was truly an honor to witness.

122
00:06:59,877 --> 00:07:01,671
What, those washed-up hacks?

123
00:07:01,754 --> 00:07:04,882
They needed to be taught what happens
when they try to threaten me.

124
00:07:04,966 --> 00:07:09,053
They won't be bothering us anymore,
that's for sure. [laughing]

125
00:07:11,347 --> 00:07:12,515
[grunting]

126
00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:17,311
Oh, oops, sorry. Can you carry her again?

127
00:07:17,395 --> 00:07:19,564
Scorpia, you don't have to ask.

128
00:07:19,647 --> 00:07:21,315
Carry her, idiot. Move.

129
00:07:23,067 --> 00:07:26,446
You know, I'm starting to think
this place gets a bad rap.

130
00:07:26,529 --> 00:07:28,239
-Oh, I'm with you.
-[groaning]

131
00:07:29,615 --> 00:07:30,867
It's nice and toasty.

132
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:33,786
If you look for the ground ripples
you can avoid the quicksand.

133
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:37,081
And my exoskeleton
is loving this dry climate.

134
00:07:37,165 --> 00:07:39,500
And you can take whatever you want.

135
00:07:39,584 --> 00:07:42,211
The meaner you are, the more they listen.

136
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:44,672
-Give me your dart gun.
-Oh! Uh...

137
00:07:44,755 --> 00:07:45,798
-Yeah, go.
-See?

138
00:07:45,882 --> 00:07:46,841
[laughing]

139
00:07:47,341 --> 00:07:49,469
I'm going to call you Kyle.

140
00:07:49,552 --> 00:07:52,722
-Uh... What?
-Shut up and keep walking, Kyle.

141
00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:54,640
Uh... Okay.

142
00:07:54,724 --> 00:07:55,933
[both laughing]

143
00:07:57,894 --> 00:07:59,729
So, this is fun.

144
00:08:01,397 --> 00:08:02,899
Yeah. It is.

145
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:03,816

[groans]

149
00:08:11,282 --> 00:08:14,827
You're doing that thing with your face
where it's obvious what you're thinking.

150
00:08:14,911 --> 00:08:16,287
Do you mean smiling?

151
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:17,288
[groans]

152
00:08:17,622 --> 00:08:20,458
Look, I'm just acknowledging-- [grunts]

153
00:08:27,548 --> 00:08:30,718
-We make a good team, that's it.
-Right. A good team.

154
00:08:30,801 --> 00:08:32,303
That's us.

155
00:08:32,386 --> 00:08:33,679
[chuckles]

156
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:35,806

[grunting]

159
00:08:51,948 --> 00:08:54,867
[Scorpia chuckles] This is crazy.

160
00:08:54,951 --> 00:08:57,453
Are there really animals this big?
Come on.

161
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,664
-Not anymore.
-[shrieking noise]

162
00:09:00,706 --> 00:09:01,541
What--?

163
00:09:04,502 --> 00:09:05,461
[groaning]

164
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:10,466
-What are you trying to pull?
-Nothing. What are you talking about?

165
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:12,969
-Catra, what's going on?
-I'll tell you what.

166
00:09:13,052 --> 00:09:17,598
Kyle here wasn't paying attention.
And led us right into an ambush.

[Huntara groans]

173
00:09:38,286 --> 00:09:41,163
[Glimmer] On three. One, two, three!

174
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:42,832
[both shouting]

175
00:09:46,335 --> 00:09:47,295
[Adora] Whoa.

176
00:09:48,546 --> 00:09:49,422
Whoa.

177
00:09:56,721 --> 00:09:57,805
[shouts]

178
00:09:59,348 --> 00:10:00,224
This is it.

179
00:10:00,308 --> 00:10:02,935
This is the same message
from my tracker pad.

180
00:10:05,146 --> 00:10:06,105
[shouting]

181
00:10:11,902 --> 00:10:14,322
<i>I am Mara, She-Ra of Etheria,</i>

182
00:10:14,405 --> 00:10:15,781
<i>and I am gone.</i>

183
00:10:15,865 --> 00:10:18,451
Mara. I have so many questions for you.

184
00:10:18,534 --> 00:10:20,578
I don't even know where to start.

185
00:10:22,413 --> 00:10:25,791
<i>I am Mara, She-Ra of Etheria,</i>
<i>and I am gone.</i>

186
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:28,377
Um... Hi? I'm Adora.

187
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:32,965
<i>I am Mara, </i>[distorted] <i>She-Ra of Etheria,</i>
<i>and I am gone.</i>

188
00:10:33,549 --> 00:10:35,676
-Well, that's unsettling.
-No.

189
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,803
No, no. This isn't it!

190
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:41,557
I've done this before.
There's usually a password or something.

191
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:44,226
-<i>I am Mara, She-Ra of Etheria,</i>
-Eternia.

192
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:47,229
<i>-and I am gone.</i>
-I have the sword. I am She-Ra.

193
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:50,650
Administrator detected! Speak to me!

194
00:10:50,733 --> 00:10:54,403
<i>I am Mara, She-Ra of Etheria,</i>
<i>and I am gone.</i>

195
00:10:56,405 --> 00:10:57,615
[Adora laughing]

196
00:11:01,243 --> 00:11:04,246
-Adora?
-Of course it's on a loop.

197
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:05,498
Of course it is.

198
00:11:05,581 --> 00:11:08,668
Because why would a hologram
ever give me a straight answer?

199
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:10,961
Solve a puzzle. Train. Let go.

200
00:11:11,045 --> 00:11:13,964
I do everything they tell me,
waiting for answers,

201
00:11:14,048 --> 00:11:16,342
and all I'm left with is...

202
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:22,098
Why was I taken from my family?
Why was I forced to become a soldier?

203
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:25,893
Why did I come here if this was nothing
but another dead end?

204
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:32,733
Adora, I'm sorry. Maybe we can--

205
00:11:48,082 --> 00:11:49,750
[She-Ra Mara crying]

206
00:11:54,463 --> 00:11:57,091
<i>I don't have much time.</i>
<i>I barely made it out.</i>

207
00:11:57,591 --> 00:12:00,719
<i>If you are seeing this,</i>
<i>it means you wield the Sword.</i>

208
00:12:00,803 --> 00:12:02,471
<i>You are the new She-Ra.</i>

209
00:12:03,472 --> 00:12:04,890
<i>It means I failed.</i>

210
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:07,351
<i>I was supposed to be the last.</i>

211
00:12:07,893 --> 00:12:09,770
<i>And I am so, so sorry.</i>

212
00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:12,606
[all shouting]

213
00:12:15,484 --> 00:12:17,945
Oh, no. It's Tung Lashor!

214
00:12:18,028 --> 00:12:19,113
[laughing]

215
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:21,782
I'm sorry, what?

216
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:25,077
Tung Lashor leads the number two gang
in the Crimson Waste.

217
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:28,622
He's been itching to push Huntara out
for years and become number one.

218
00:12:28,706 --> 00:12:30,958
With her gone, they'd run this place.

219
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:36,755
And it looks like today
is our lucky, lucky day.

220
00:12:43,804 --> 00:12:48,309
I never thought you'd be dumb enough
to step foot out here without Huntara.

221
00:12:48,392 --> 00:12:50,436
But here you are.

222
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:53,564
And now I'm gonna leave your bones
as a warning

223
00:12:53,647 --> 00:12:56,817
to all who cross Tung Lashor,

224
00:12:56,901 --> 00:12:59,862
strongest in the Crimson Waste.

225
00:13:01,947 --> 00:13:03,032
[laughing]

226
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:08,037
It sounds even stupider the second time.

227
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:11,457
Seriously, Tung Lashor? Pfft.

228
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:14,710
-Which one of you came up with that?
-[chuckles] Right?

229
00:13:14,793 --> 00:13:16,795
It's like, what, did you lose a bet?

230
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:18,547
[laughing]

231
00:13:20,424 --> 00:13:21,842
-[shouting]
-[groans]

232
00:13:22,593 --> 00:13:25,054
You done, outsider?

233
00:13:25,137 --> 00:13:26,347
[laughing]

234
00:13:27,431 --> 00:13:30,226
Are you kidding? I'm just getting started.

235
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:34,897
First, all that "leaving your bones" talk,
it's just too much.

236
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:39,902
But I'm sure around here
you're considered very scary.

237
00:13:39,985 --> 00:13:41,070
[growling]

238
00:13:41,153 --> 00:13:45,074
Second, they're not with Huntara anymore,
they're with me.

239
00:13:45,157 --> 00:13:46,242
And third...

240
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:50,663
I like that whip.
I think I'll be taking it.

241
00:13:50,746 --> 00:13:52,039
[laughing]

242
00:13:52,581 --> 00:13:57,419
-Is that so? Big talk for such a little--
-Hey, do you even know how to use a whip?

243
00:13:57,503 --> 00:14:00,256
-Can't be hard if this guy figured it out.
-Uh...

244
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:02,716
-I said--
-[Scorpia] I think it's all in the wrist.

245
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,844
Like wa-pow! Crack! Whip!

246
00:14:05,928 --> 00:14:08,806
I'm not going to say whip
when I use the whip. No one does that.

247
00:14:08,889 --> 00:14:11,934
Ooh. Maybe you can say a catchphrase then.
Like, uh...

248
00:14:12,101 --> 00:14:13,060
Like, "Whip."

249
00:14:13,143 --> 00:14:15,604
It's-- I mean, I'm just spitballing here.

250
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:18,399
-I like, I don't know, like...
-Enough!

251
00:14:18,482 --> 00:14:21,402
I'm gonna wipe that smirk
off your face, outsider!

252
00:14:21,485 --> 00:14:22,486
[Tung Lashor growls]

253
00:14:23,153 --> 00:14:26,824
Who's the strongest in the Crimson Waste?

254
00:14:26,907 --> 00:14:30,494
[all] Lashor! Lashor!

255
00:14:31,078 --> 00:14:33,581
And don't you forget it.

256
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,046
Whip!

257
00:14:41,422 --> 00:14:42,506
Catra!

258
00:14:47,094 --> 00:14:48,679
[grunting and shouting]

259
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:08,616
Where's all that big talk now, Kitty?

260
00:15:09,283 --> 00:15:11,660
-Catra!
-[laughing]

261
00:15:16,707 --> 00:15:17,875
[laughing]

262
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:20,794
[shouting]

263
00:15:24,882 --> 00:15:26,133
You cheating little--

264
00:15:26,842 --> 00:15:28,385
[shouting and grunting]

265
00:15:38,812 --> 00:15:40,981
-What? Oh, no.
-Oh, hold on.

266
00:15:47,821 --> 00:15:50,824
-Great. Thanks for the whip.
-Guys.

267
00:15:50,908 --> 00:15:54,536
-[Tung Lashor] Anybody! Help me, please!
-[laughs] That was too easy.

268
00:15:54,995 --> 00:15:58,832
Now, who's the strongest
in the Crimson Waste?

269
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:03,420
Catra. Catra. Catra.

270
00:16:03,504 --> 00:16:04,922
Catra!

271
00:16:05,005 --> 00:16:08,884
[all] Catra! Catra! Catra!

272
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:10,010
Catra!

273
00:16:10,094 --> 00:16:12,513
And don't you forget it.

274
00:16:12,596 --> 00:16:13,973
Yeah!

275
00:16:25,526 --> 00:16:28,404
<i>I don't know what they told you,</i>
<i>but it wasn't all bad at first.</i>

276
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:32,825
<i>We were the first ones to settle Etheria,</i>
<i>to study this planet's magic.</i>

277
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:35,077
<i>How could it go so wrong?</i>

278
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:38,372
<i>Light Hope use the-- Can't--</i>
<i>Weapon-- The weapon-- Weapon--</i>

279
00:16:38,455 --> 00:16:40,124
What weapon?

280
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:43,043
Bow, how's it going? Have you fixed it?

281
00:16:43,127 --> 00:16:47,506
[Bow] I'm trying, but I think the message
got damaged when the ship crashed.

282
00:16:47,589 --> 00:16:51,802
<i>I opened a portal to a completely empty</i>
<i>dimension and pulled Etheria in.</i>

283
00:16:51,885 --> 00:16:56,223
<i>I hid us from the rest of the universe</i>
<i>to keep everyone safe.</i>

284
00:16:56,306 --> 00:16:58,976
<i>This is the one place</i>
<i>they'll never find us.</i>

285
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:02,146
<i>I saw what they would do.</i>
<i>The deaths that would follow.</i>

286
00:17:02,229 --> 00:17:06,358
<i>I couldn't stop them before,</i>
<i>but I can now. Hiding is our only option.</i>

287
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:08,402
<i>Maybe it's been a week.</i>

288
00:17:08,986 --> 00:17:10,738
<i>Maybe it's been thousands of years.</i>

289
00:17:11,321 --> 00:17:13,407
<i>I never wanted to be a hero.</i>

290
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:15,951
<i>I won't be remembered as one.</i>

291
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:17,286
[alarm wailing]

292
00:17:18,328 --> 00:17:21,832
<i>You have the Sword now.</i>
<i>It is the Administrator Key to our planet.</i>

293
00:17:21,915 --> 00:17:25,335
<i>With it, you can activate a portal.</i>
<i>So I'm begging you.</i>

294
00:17:25,419 --> 00:17:27,838
<i>Don't do it. Leave us here.</i>

295
00:17:27,921 --> 00:17:31,175
<i>If you open a portal,</i>
<i>death and destruction will follow.</i>

296
00:17:31,258 --> 00:17:34,094
<i>For the good of the universe,</i>
<i>Etheria must stay in Despondos.</i>

297
00:17:34,178 --> 00:17:36,013
<i>If not, everyone will--</i>

298
00:17:39,016 --> 00:17:40,642
[clapping nearby]

299
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:44,521
Who's there? Come out and face Huntara!

300
00:17:44,605 --> 00:17:46,065
[both grunting]

301
00:17:59,244 --> 00:18:03,415
-You two joined Tung Lashor?
-[Catra] They haven't joined him.

302
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:06,585
They joined me.

303
00:18:07,169 --> 00:18:08,337
Hey, Adora.

304
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:11,048
[snaps]

305
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:17,346
For the honor of-- [grunting]

306
00:18:21,475 --> 00:18:23,727
This might be the quickest
I've ever won a fight.

307
00:18:23,811 --> 00:18:26,522
Always so dramatic with you,
isn't it, Adora?

308
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:27,815
[groaning]

309
00:18:28,357 --> 00:18:30,776
Huntara! Get them out!

310
00:18:31,068 --> 00:18:32,236
[grunting]

311
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:34,696
-Stop her.
-[gasps]

312
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:42,121
[all cheering]

313
00:18:43,413 --> 00:18:46,834
A toast to driving Huntara
out of the Waste!

314
00:18:46,917 --> 00:18:48,085
[all cheering]

315
00:18:48,627 --> 00:18:52,089
A toast to finding all this new loot, huh?

316
00:18:53,882 --> 00:18:58,720
And a toast to Boss Catra,
best leader we've ever had!

317
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:00,806
Yeah!

318
00:19:03,308 --> 00:19:08,605
-Scorpia! A toast to Scorpia!
-[woman] Oh, yes, Scorpia! Whoo!

319
00:19:09,606 --> 00:19:14,153
What? I can't.
You guys, I-- Thank you. Yes. Gosh.

320
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:17,322
[laughing]

321
00:19:25,747 --> 00:19:27,082
Can you believe this?

322
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:29,751
They said this was called a "party."

323
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:34,423
I like it. When we go back,
there's going to be a lot more parties.

324
00:19:35,924 --> 00:19:39,011
-Uh, the crazy desert lady got away.
-Let her.

325
00:19:39,094 --> 00:19:41,346
We've got the most important thing
right here.

326
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:42,931
You heard that hologram.

327
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:45,350
This is the key to the whole planet.

328
00:19:45,434 --> 00:19:47,769
When I bring this back to the Fright Zone,

329
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:49,855
Hordak will see me for what I'm worth

330
00:19:49,938 --> 00:19:51,440
and I'll be back on top.

331
00:19:52,399 --> 00:19:55,903
Or, you know, counterpoint,
we don't go back at all.

332
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,864
What? Why wouldn't we go back?

333
00:19:59,489 --> 00:20:01,867
Uh... Because you hate it there?

334
00:20:02,409 --> 00:20:04,119
I don't.

335
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:05,537
Hear me out, okay?

336
00:20:05,621 --> 00:20:09,374
Within a day, you've defeated the gangs
ruling the Crimson Waste

337
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:11,293
and made yourself their leader.

338
00:20:11,376 --> 00:20:14,588
This is the happiest I've ever seen you.
Scratch that.

339
00:20:14,671 --> 00:20:18,550
This is the first time
I've ever seen you happy, period.

340
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:22,221
So, why would we go back?

341
00:20:22,304 --> 00:20:24,973
Let's stay here. Forget Hordak.

342
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:27,392
Forget Adora. Forget all of them.

343
00:20:27,476 --> 00:20:31,480
We could rule the Crimson Waste together,
just the two of us.

344
00:20:31,563 --> 00:20:34,900
We could, you know, be happy.

345
00:20:35,484 --> 00:20:36,735
I-- I don't--

346
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:40,822
I have to go check on the prisoner.

347
00:20:43,825 --> 00:20:44,868
[grunting]

348
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:47,829
Catra, you can't do this.

349
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:50,165
Well, hello to you, too.

350
00:20:51,959 --> 00:20:53,669
What can't I do this time?

351
00:20:53,752 --> 00:20:56,088
Hordak is trying to open a portal.

352
00:20:56,171 --> 00:20:59,258
He wants to bring the rest
of the Horde army through to Etheria.

353
00:20:59,341 --> 00:21:01,009
We can't let that happen.

354
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:03,011
The rest of the Horde army?

355
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:07,015
Hordak is part of a gigantic evil army
from another world--

356
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:09,101
[laughs] Never a dull moment with you.

357
00:21:09,184 --> 00:21:12,688
Why would I be against more Horde?
That means we win and you lose.

358
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:16,108
We'll all lose if Hordak
uses his portal machine.

359
00:21:16,191 --> 00:21:20,696
Light Hope and Mara both said that
opening a portal will endanger everyone.

360
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:24,700
You'll listen to anything
weird old holograms tell you, won't you?

361
00:21:24,783 --> 00:21:27,119
You should really try to get over that.

362
00:21:27,202 --> 00:21:29,788
Besides, how do you know
about what Hordak's doing?

363
00:21:29,871 --> 00:21:31,957
Shadow Weaver told me.

364
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:36,211
-We know all about Hordak's plan.
-Shadow Weaver told you?

365
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:39,631
How exactly did Shadow Weaver
tell you this?

366
00:21:40,215 --> 00:21:42,384
-You didn't know?
-How?

367
00:21:43,051 --> 00:21:46,805
Catra, Shadow Weaver is in Bright Moon.

368
00:21:50,392 --> 00:21:53,437
Shadow Weaver left me for you.

369
00:21:54,479 --> 00:21:58,358
All of this happened because of you.

370
00:21:59,234 --> 00:22:00,068
Catra?

371
00:22:00,819 --> 00:22:03,196
Catra, please, you have to listen.

372
00:22:04,906 --> 00:22:06,325
[Catra grunting]

373
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:15,042
[Scorpia] Hey, Catra.

374
00:22:16,585 --> 00:22:18,837
Whoa, there. Gotta be careful, boss.

375
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,297
[all cheering]

376
00:22:24,301 --> 00:22:26,011
Catra? You okay?

377
00:22:27,137 --> 00:22:28,388
We are going back.

378
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:31,141
[gasps]

379
00:22:32,225 --> 00:22:35,020
We are going to open a portal.

380
00:22:35,729 --> 00:22:40,358
And we are going to crush them all.

381
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:44,362
[closing theme playing]
