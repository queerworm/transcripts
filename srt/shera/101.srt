[scoffs] Not again.

10
00:01:23,458 --> 00:01:28,254
At attention, cadets. Your simulation
is about to begin. Here's your scenario.

11
00:01:28,338 --> 00:01:31,007
You'll be passing through
the treacherous Whispering Woods

12
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:33,968
to reach the heart of rebel insurgency,
Bright Moon.

13
00:01:34,052 --> 00:01:36,471
Your mission is to defeat
the Queen of the Princesses

14
00:01:36,554 --> 00:01:38,932
and liberate Bright Moon
in Lord Hordak's name.

15
00:01:39,474 --> 00:01:42,102
-Where is Catra?
-She will be here. I promise.

16
00:01:42,685 --> 00:01:45,772
Mm-hmm. The Whispering Woods
is full of princesses.

17
00:01:46,272 --> 00:01:48,024
Vicious, violent instigators.

18
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:52,237
They will take you out if given
the chance. Don't give it to them.

19
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,072
Good luck, recruits.

20
00:01:58,618 --> 00:02:00,870

Catra.

36
00:03:25,121 --> 00:03:27,957
Did you really show up late
and let us do all the hard parts?

37
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:29,959
That is low, even for you.

38
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:31,336
Aw.

You should have seen your face.
You were like, "Aah, no! Betrayal."

45
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:55,568
Oh, come on, Catra.
We're senior cadets now.

46
00:03:55,652 --> 00:03:59,572
I can't believe you're still pulling
such childish, immature-- Is that a mouse?

00:03:59,656 --> 00:04:00,698
What? Where?

-Are you ever going to not fall for that?
-I don't know.

00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:08,081
Are you ever going to let it go?

51
00:04:08,164 --> 00:04:09,666
That was one time.

52
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:13,002
I know, but for some reason
it's always funny.

53
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:14,420
[Shadow Weaver] Adora.

54
00:04:16,297 --> 00:04:17,548
Shadow Weaver.

55
00:04:17,632 --> 00:04:19,217
[Shadow Weaver] You have done well.

56
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:22,553
You've completed your training course
in record time.

57
00:04:22,637 --> 00:04:25,556
Uh, well, that wasn't just me.
You know, Catra did, too.

58
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:29,227
[Shadow Weaver] Ah, yes.
How someone as unmotivated as you

59
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:32,730
completed the course
in that time, I'll never know.

60
00:04:32,814 --> 00:04:35,483
Always serving up those pep talks,
huh, Shadow Weaver?

61
00:04:35,566 --> 00:04:36,442
Silence!

62
00:04:36,526 --> 00:04:39,237
Do not be flippant with me, cadet.

63
00:04:40,363 --> 00:04:44,117
-Sorry, Shadow Weaver.
-[Shadow Weaver] Adora, walk with me.

64
00:04:46,911 --> 00:04:48,079
Adora.

65
00:04:50,248 --> 00:04:52,583
Lord Hordak has been watching you.

66
00:04:52,667 --> 00:04:56,671
He thinks you are a fine candidate
for Force Captain.

67
00:04:56,754 --> 00:05:00,508
Really? Force Captain?
Lord Hordak said that about me?

68
00:05:00,591 --> 00:05:03,636
[Shadow Weaver] Yes.
He sees great promise in you.

69
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:07,473
In fact, he has elected you
the honor of leading a squadron

70
00:05:07,557 --> 00:05:10,768
in the invasion
of the rebel Fortress of Thaymor.

71
00:05:10,852 --> 00:05:14,314
Thaymor?
You mean we're finally seeing active duty?

72
00:05:14,397 --> 00:05:16,858
You are seeing active duty.

73
00:05:16,941 --> 00:05:19,444
But I'll be able
to bring my team along, right?

74
00:05:19,527 --> 00:05:22,780
Your team is not ready.
They'll only slow you down.

75
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:27,327
Shadow Weaver, with respect,
they've been training hard for this, too.

76
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:30,330
And Catra, all she wants
is to get out there and prove herself.

77
00:05:30,413 --> 00:05:33,916
Then she should have worked harder
to prove herself to me.

78
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,420
This is what I raised you for, Adora.

79
00:05:38,421 --> 00:05:41,883
Now is your chance
to prove yourself.

80
00:05:43,217 --> 00:05:47,930
I saw talent in you the moment
I found you as an orphan child

81
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:49,265
and took you in.

82
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:54,062
Is this not what you've wanted since
you were old enough to want anything?

83
00:05:54,145 --> 00:05:56,814
-Yes.
-With you at the forefront,

84
00:05:56,898 --> 00:06:01,402
we will crush the Bright Moon Rebellion
once and for all.

85
00:06:01,486 --> 00:06:04,155
Do not disappoint me.

86
00:06:11,954 --> 00:06:13,247
[Angella] Send her in.

87
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:25,927
-Your Majesty.
-I'm told you disobeyed orders

88
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:29,013
and led the Rebellion into a dangerous
combat situation

89
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:30,807
after you were ordered to retreat.

90
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:34,602
I was trying to protect a village
from falling into the Horde's grasp.

91
00:06:34,685 --> 00:06:38,773
You were reckless and put yourself
and the other rebels in danger.

92
00:06:38,856 --> 00:06:41,192
Fighting is supposed to be dangerous!

93
00:06:41,275 --> 00:06:44,612
How are we going to hold our own
against the Horde if we keep retreating?

94
00:06:44,695 --> 00:06:47,448
Pretty soon, we won't have
anything left to defend.

95
00:06:47,532 --> 00:06:50,952
I'm growing tired of your back-talking,
Commander Glimmer.

96
00:06:51,035 --> 00:06:55,123
Why did you even make me a commander
if you won't let me fight?

97
00:06:55,206 --> 00:06:57,917
That's enough! You're grounded!

98
00:06:58,835 --> 00:07:00,795
-[scoffs] Mom!
-You heard me.

99
00:07:00,878 --> 00:07:05,216
-You never let me do anything!
-We're not having this discussion tonight.

100
00:07:05,299 --> 00:07:08,678
You are embarrassing me
in front of my royal court!

101
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:12,098
Oh, I'm embarrassing you?

102
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:14,600
Go to your room!

103
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:16,436
I'm going!

104
00:07:19,605 --> 00:07:20,648

105
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:34,454
-[grunts]
-What'd she say? Hey, what's this?

106
00:07:34,537 --> 00:07:36,122
Hey! Give it back.

107
00:07:37,665 --> 00:07:39,834
No way. You've been promoted?

108
00:07:39,917 --> 00:07:41,586
Well, kind of.

109
00:07:41,669 --> 00:07:44,172
I mean, yeah, I guess. Heh.

110
00:07:44,255 --> 00:07:48,092
-But it's not a big deal.
-Are you kidding? That is awesome.

111
00:07:48,176 --> 00:07:51,888
We're gonna see the world and conquer it.
Adora, I need to blow something up.

112
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:52,805
[purring]

113
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:54,265
-Um...
-What?

114
00:07:54,348 --> 00:07:57,143
Shadow Weaver says you're not coming.

115
00:07:57,226 --> 00:07:59,979
What? My time was just as good
as yours today.

116
00:08:00,062 --> 00:08:01,564
What is her problem with me?

117
00:08:01,647 --> 00:08:04,567
I mean, you are kind of disrespectful.

118
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:06,235
Why should I respect her?

119
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:08,279
She's bitter that she doesn't have
any real power

120
00:08:08,362 --> 00:08:10,531
that doesn't come from Hordak
and everyone knows it.

121
00:08:10,615 --> 00:08:13,993
I guess it sure must be easy being
a people pleaser like you.

122
00:08:14,076 --> 00:08:15,495
I am not a pe--

123
00:08:16,037 --> 00:08:17,121
Catra, wait!

124
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:19,373
[sighs]

125
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,722
Look, I'm sorry.

126
00:08:34,805 --> 00:08:37,350
I didn't even think you wanted
to be a Force Captain.

127
00:08:37,433 --> 00:08:40,353
I don't. Here, take your stupid badge.

128
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:42,980
Come on, Catra.

129
00:08:43,064 --> 00:08:46,984
This is what I have been working for
my entire life.

130
00:08:47,318 --> 00:08:51,072
I was hoping you could be,
I don't know, happy for me.

131
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:55,326
Ugh, whatever. It's not like I even care.

132
00:08:55,409 --> 00:08:59,664
I just wanna get out of this dump
at some point before I die of boredom.

133
00:09:00,414 --> 00:09:03,501
I wonder what's even outside
the Fright Zone anyway.

134
00:09:05,419 --> 00:09:07,338
Why don't we go find out?

135
00:09:08,756 --> 00:09:11,926
[Catra] I take it all back.
You're officially awesome.

136
00:09:12,009 --> 00:09:14,220
I can't believe
you actually stole a skiff.

137
00:09:14,303 --> 00:09:16,389
Borrowed.
Please don't make me regret this.

138
00:09:16,472 --> 00:09:20,142
I've always wanted to drive one
of these things. Here, give me.

139
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:22,311
Whoa, there.
Save us enough fuel to get back.

140
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:25,815
That is a problem
for future Adora and Catra.

141
00:09:26,816 --> 00:09:29,151
-I'm driving.
-I want it.

142
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:30,528
[Catra] Can't have it!

143
00:09:30,611 --> 00:09:31,904
[both shouting]

144
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:34,532
-Let me.
-Give me. I'm doing it.

145
00:09:34,615 --> 00:09:36,951
-I want it.
-No, I've got it.

146
00:09:37,868 --> 00:09:39,036
Catra!

147
00:09:42,873 --> 00:09:44,083
What is it?

148
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:46,586
I think this must be the Whispering Woods.

149
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:49,171
They say there are strange,
old monsters in there,

150
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:51,674
and the trees move
when you're not looking.

151
00:09:51,757 --> 00:09:55,720
Every Horde squadron they've sent in there
has never come out again.

152
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:57,430
Let's go in.

153
00:09:57,513 --> 00:09:59,390
Wait, what? [yells]

154
00:09:59,473 --> 00:10:01,225
[Catra] Woo-hoo!

155
00:10:01,309 --> 00:10:03,019
[shouting, then laughing]

156
00:10:08,065 --> 00:10:09,317
[both shouting]

157
00:10:10,985 --> 00:10:12,194
Catra, slow down!

158
00:10:13,654 --> 00:10:15,531
Catra, tree! Tree!

00:10:40,056 --> 00:10:41,057
Huh?

165
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:45,561
Whoa.

166
00:10:49,982 --> 00:10:50,816

-You fell out of the skiff

175
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:17,385
-after you drove it into a tree.
-No, you drove it into a tree.

176
00:11:17,468 --> 00:11:19,428
Ah, up for debate. Let's go.

177
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:21,722
-Wait. Where is it? Where'd it go?
-What?

178
00:11:21,806 --> 00:11:24,141
There was a sword. It was right here.

179
00:11:24,225 --> 00:11:26,894
I tried to touch it,
but it got really bright.

180
00:11:26,977 --> 00:11:29,188
Are you brain damaged?
Don't be brain damaged.

181
00:11:29,271 --> 00:11:30,773
Oh, Shadow Weaver's gonna kill me.

182
00:11:30,856 --> 00:11:34,026
I'm not brain damaged.
It was here, I saw it.

183
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:37,571
Well, there's nothing here now.
So, come on, let's go.

184
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:56,966
[Glimmer] "Dear Mom,
I know you'll never read this,

185
00:11:57,049 --> 00:12:01,929
but I have to say it somewhere.
I feel like you...

186
00:12:03,013 --> 00:12:05,975
don't respect me."

187
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:11,939
[shrieks]

188
00:12:15,025 --> 00:12:16,193
[groans]

189
00:12:17,528 --> 00:12:19,447
Watch it! You almost hit me!

190
00:12:20,865 --> 00:12:23,117
-Hey, Glimmer!
-Shh!

191
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:25,661
Bow, what are you doing here?

192
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:27,913
What did you say? Come down here!

193
00:12:27,997 --> 00:12:30,499
I can't, I'm grounded.

194
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:31,417
What?

195
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,669
[whispering] I'm grounded.

196
00:12:34,837 --> 00:12:35,671
What?

197
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:39,508
-I'm... grounded.
-[shouts]

198
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:45,598
-[groans] I'm so mad at my mom.
-Is this about the siege on Elberon?

199
00:12:45,681 --> 00:12:47,975
I was just trying to defend
another one of our villages

200
00:12:48,058 --> 00:12:49,810
from falling into the Horde's clutches!

201
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:51,771
She stationed me all the way out there

202
00:12:51,854 --> 00:12:53,939
because it's too remote
to ever get attacked,

203
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:57,860
but then it did, and it was my one chance
to prove that I can do this.

204
00:12:57,943 --> 00:13:01,781
But she acts like I can't do anything
because I'm just a princess.

205
00:13:01,864 --> 00:13:02,823
[grumbles]

206
00:13:03,991 --> 00:13:07,411
That doesn't make any sense.
Everyone here is a princess.

207
00:13:07,495 --> 00:13:10,039
I'm, like, the only one
who's not a princess.

208
00:13:10,122 --> 00:13:12,291
[groans] Tell that to my mom.

209
00:13:12,374 --> 00:13:15,544
-Hey, where does this go?
-Bottom drawer.

210
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:18,088
Anyway, your mom might have a point.

211
00:13:18,172 --> 00:13:21,467
Only reason you got out of there
is because of your teleportation powers,

212
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:24,136
and, let's face it,
they don't always work that well.

213
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:25,971
Looking for support here, Bow!

214
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:28,349
I'm just saying,
if you wanna prove yourself,

215
00:13:28,432 --> 00:13:31,727
it's gonna take more than running
recklessly into any old battle.

216
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:35,940
Luckily, I've got just the thing.
Check this out.

217
00:13:36,023 --> 00:13:39,401
I detected a piece of First Ones tech
in the Whispering Woods.

218
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:42,404
A pretty powerful one, too,
by the size of these readings.

219
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:46,534
If you find this one and bring it back,
your mom is bound to be impressed.

220
00:13:46,617 --> 00:13:48,577
Did you forget I'm grounded?

221
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:49,745
[knocking on door]

222
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:52,665
-[Angella] Glimmer? Are you in there?
-Uh...

223
00:13:53,749 --> 00:13:54,708
Ah!

224
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:56,001
Glimmer?

225
00:13:56,085 --> 00:13:57,503
Everything's fine, Mom.

226
00:13:57,586 --> 00:14:00,130
Is someone else in there? I heard voices.

227
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:03,676
No one else is in here.
Can you leave me alone?

228
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:06,679
I don't appreciate your tone right now,
young lady.

229
00:14:06,762 --> 00:14:09,515
-[Glimmer] What tone?
-That attitude is never gonna help you.

230
00:14:09,598 --> 00:14:12,226
-You can't act that way--
-[Glimmer] That's not fair!

231
00:14:12,309 --> 00:14:13,394
[door slams]

232
00:14:13,936 --> 00:14:14,770
I'm in.

233
00:14:15,604 --> 00:14:16,647
[all snoring]

234
00:14:21,735 --> 00:14:22,778
[grunts]

235
00:14:23,362 --> 00:14:24,780
[female voice] <i>Adora.</i>

236
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:26,448
<i>Adora.</i>

237
00:14:27,116 --> 00:14:29,034
-Adora!
-[gasps]

238
00:14:41,171 --> 00:14:44,049
-Hey, where are you going?
-Back to the woods.

239
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:47,761
-There's something I need to figure out.
-What? You're not--

240
00:14:47,845 --> 00:14:49,096
[robot beeping]

241
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:53,809
What is wrong with you? You've been
acting weird since we got back.

242
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:55,311
Sure you're not brain damaged?

243
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:57,771
Look, Catra,
I know I saw something out there.

244
00:14:57,855 --> 00:15:01,609
I just need to get another look.
It feels important somehow.

245
00:15:01,692 --> 00:15:03,485
-Sounds good. Let's go.
-No.

246
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:05,988
I don't want you getting in trouble
on my behalf.

247
00:15:06,071 --> 00:15:09,992
Just cover for me, okay? I'll be back
before anyone knows I'm gone.

248
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:10,993
Adora!

249
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:12,494
Adora!

250
00:15:14,371 --> 00:15:16,206
Come on, come on!

251
00:15:17,082 --> 00:15:19,126
Ah, please. Tell me we're not lost.

252
00:15:19,209 --> 00:15:21,378
No, this thing is acting up.

253
00:15:21,462 --> 00:15:24,465
Looks like it's being overloaded
by the tech's signal.

254
00:15:24,548 --> 00:15:25,966
We must be getting close!

255
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,053
Uh... I think it's that way.

256
00:15:29,136 --> 00:15:30,387
What makes you say that?

257
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:34,808
Oh, yeah. That'll do it.

258
00:15:35,893 --> 00:15:40,272
[Adora] What are you doing out here,
Adora? Catra's right, this is crazy.

259
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:43,150
There's no sword, you just got hit
on the head a little too hard.

260
00:15:43,233 --> 00:15:46,236
You should go back home
and forget about all of this.

261
00:15:57,331 --> 00:16:00,125
[Glimmer]
Bow, just let me lead the way, okay?

262
00:16:00,668 --> 00:16:03,003
[Bow] The light came
from the edge of the forest.

263
00:16:03,087 --> 00:16:06,882
-Yes, you saw the light. It's this way.
-The tracker pad says otherwise.

264
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:09,677
-It's this way-- [gasps]
-[gasps]

265
00:16:10,594 --> 00:16:12,304
-Horde soldier!
-I see her!

266
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:14,473
[both yelling]

267
00:16:18,435 --> 00:16:19,311
[gasps]

268
00:16:20,938 --> 00:16:21,939
[grunting]

269
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:24,108
Bow, catch.

270
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:28,362
Give me the sword.

271
00:16:28,445 --> 00:16:29,697
[yelling]

272
00:16:30,864 --> 00:16:32,074
Get off.

273
00:16:37,621 --> 00:16:40,290
Stand down. I don't wanna hurt you.

274
00:16:40,374 --> 00:16:43,877
Since when do Horde soldiers
not want to hurt anyone?

275
00:16:45,963 --> 00:16:47,840
[all grunting and shouting]

276
00:16:58,809 --> 00:17:00,060
[Adora] What?

277
00:17:00,811 --> 00:17:02,896
[female voice] Hello, Adora.

278
00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:06,150
Who are you? What's going on?

279
00:17:06,567 --> 00:17:10,487
My name is Light Hope.
I have been waiting a long time for you,

280
00:17:10,571 --> 00:17:14,575
but I could not reach you until you forged
your connection with the sword.

281
00:17:14,658 --> 00:17:17,870
-You sent the sword?
-The sword is meant for you.

282
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:20,622
Etheria has need of you, Adora.

283
00:17:21,206 --> 00:17:25,878
Will you answer its call?
Will you fight for the honor of Grayskull?

284
00:17:25,961 --> 00:17:29,214
What are you talking about?
What is-- What's Grayskull?

285
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:32,051
You're not making any sense!
I don't understand!

286
00:17:32,134 --> 00:17:33,802
-You will.
-Wait!

287
00:17:35,596 --> 00:17:36,680
[grunts]

288
00:17:39,349 --> 00:17:40,642
[groaning]

289
00:17:41,852 --> 00:17:43,145
Hey! She's awake.

290
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:48,067
-What happened?
-Quiet, Horde spy, I ask the questions.

291
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:50,652
How did you make it this far
into the Whispering Woods?

292
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:52,362
I just walked in.

293
00:17:52,446 --> 00:17:54,114
And I'm not a spy.

294
00:17:54,198 --> 00:17:58,452
Sure, sure. You just so happened
to find yourself in the Whispering Woods,

295
00:17:58,535 --> 00:18:01,789
like you just so happened
to try and steal our sword.

296
00:18:01,872 --> 00:18:04,291
It's not yours. I found it first.

297
00:18:04,374 --> 00:18:07,669
The Whispering Woods
is under the Rebellion's protection.

298
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:10,089
You were lucky to make it
as far as you did.

299
00:18:10,172 --> 00:18:11,006
Come on, Bow.

300
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:14,802
Let's get this spy back to Bright Moon
where she can be interrogated properly.

301
00:18:16,011 --> 00:18:17,221
This is perfect.

302
00:18:17,304 --> 00:18:19,640
Not only do we have First Ones tech
for the Rebellion,

303
00:18:19,723 --> 00:18:24,520
we've also captured a Horde spy.
My mom's gonna be so impressed.

304
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:26,855
Now come on, on your feet.

305
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:30,567
[Bow] You positive we're going
the right way, Glimmer?

306
00:18:30,651 --> 00:18:34,655
I know what I'm doing, Bow.
Can you please just trust me for once?

307
00:18:34,738 --> 00:18:36,490
You know I always trust you,

308
00:18:36,573 --> 00:18:38,784
but I'm starting to get
a little freaked out.

309
00:18:38,867 --> 00:18:40,994
I mean,
I pretty much grew up in these woods,

310
00:18:41,078 --> 00:18:43,330
and I've never even seen
this part of them.

311
00:18:43,413 --> 00:18:46,166
I've heard stories
about weird stuff out here.

312
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:49,378
It's fine, okay?
Just let me figure this out.

313
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:51,880
Okay! Touchy.

314
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:53,132
Sorry about her.

315
00:18:53,215 --> 00:18:55,092
Usually she's really nice.

316
00:18:56,468 --> 00:18:57,970
Not much for talking, huh?

317
00:18:58,053 --> 00:19:00,556
I prefer not to swap pleasantries
with my captors.

318
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:02,057
There. Suit yourself.

319
00:19:05,936 --> 00:19:08,939
You know she's a princess, right?
How can you follow her?

320
00:19:09,022 --> 00:19:11,984
Princesses are a dangerous threat
to everyone on Etheria.

321
00:19:12,568 --> 00:19:16,155
-Is that what Hordak told you?
-I thought it was just common knowledge.

322
00:19:16,238 --> 00:19:19,658
They're violent instigators who don't
even know how to control their powers.

323
00:19:19,741 --> 00:19:20,868
[shouting]

324
00:19:22,619 --> 00:19:25,747
You've never actually met a princess,
have you?

325
00:19:26,582 --> 00:19:29,918
-Well, maybe not in person, but...
-[Glimmer whimpering]

326
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:46,602
-What happened to this place?
-Don't play dumb with me.

327
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:49,104
I bet you were part of the raiding party
that did this.

328
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:52,191
What are you talking about?
The Horde didn't do this.

329
00:19:55,903 --> 00:19:56,820
Oh, yeah?

330
00:19:58,238 --> 00:20:01,533
You're a heartless destroyer,
just like all the rest of your people.

331
00:20:01,617 --> 00:20:03,535
I am not a destroyer.

332
00:20:03,619 --> 00:20:06,163
Hordak says we're doing
what's best for Etheria.

333
00:20:06,246 --> 00:20:09,666
We're trying to make things better.
More orderly.

334
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:12,127
This is what's best for Etheria?

335
00:20:12,502 --> 00:20:14,087
Ever since the Horde got here,

336
00:20:14,171 --> 00:20:16,590
they've been poisoning our land,
burning our cities,

337
00:20:16,673 --> 00:20:20,761
destroying everything in their path.
And you're a part of it!

338
00:20:20,844 --> 00:20:22,596
How's that for orderly?

339
00:20:26,683 --> 00:20:29,102
This doesn't make any sense.

340
00:20:29,186 --> 00:20:31,438
The Horde would never do
something like this.

341
00:20:31,521 --> 00:20:34,233
Did you really not know any of this?

342
00:20:34,316 --> 00:20:38,195
I mean, your army is called
the Evil Horde.

343
00:20:38,278 --> 00:20:39,363
Who calls us that?

344
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:41,073
Everybody.

345
00:20:41,782 --> 00:20:44,993
The Horde rescued me when I was a baby
and gave me a home.

346
00:20:45,619 --> 00:20:48,664
They're my family.
You-- you don't know them like I do.

347
00:20:48,956 --> 00:20:51,541
Maybe you don't know them
like you think you do.

348
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:53,335
[Glimmer shouting]

349
00:20:54,336 --> 00:20:56,672
There's something out there.
Something big.

350
00:20:56,755 --> 00:20:57,589
[Bow] How big?

351
00:20:57,673 --> 00:20:59,424
[ground rumbling]

352
00:21:02,344 --> 00:21:03,887
So, pretty big then.

353
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:05,722
[screeching]

354
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:08,308
Watch out!

355
00:21:10,811 --> 00:21:12,354
[grunting and shouting]

356
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:23,824
[yelling]

357
00:21:45,053 --> 00:21:46,555
[Glimmer yelling]

358
00:21:53,895 --> 00:21:55,230
[Adora] Hey, bug brain!

359
00:21:56,648 --> 00:21:58,191
Come on, Magic Sword.

360
00:21:58,525 --> 00:22:01,653
Oh, where's a blinding flash of light
when you need one? [screams]

361
00:22:11,371 --> 00:22:12,372
[Light Hope] <i>Adora.</i>

362
00:22:15,208 --> 00:22:16,376
<i>Adora.</i>

363
00:22:16,877 --> 00:22:17,919
Adora.

364
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:19,129
[baby crying]

365
00:22:20,714 --> 00:22:23,050
<i>Will you fight for the honor of Grayskull?</i>

366
00:22:23,133 --> 00:22:25,927
[echoing] <i>...honor of Grayskull?</i>

367
00:22:26,928 --> 00:22:30,265
For the honor of Grayskull!
