1
00:00:32,073 --> 00:00:35,702
{\an8}Glimmer, come at once.
We need you in the War Room right away!

2
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:40,832
{\an8}There's no time to waste.
You must make a decision.

3
00:00:41,249 --> 00:00:42,375
{\an8}We're here for you.

4
00:00:45,962 --> 00:00:47,630
-That one!
-[groans]

5
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:49,549
Hmm.

6
00:00:53,303 --> 00:00:56,639
{\an8}The Future Queen has spoken.
At Glimmer's coronation,

7
00:00:56,723 --> 00:00:58,558
{\an8}we will be serving...

8
00:00:58,641 --> 00:00:59,934
{\an8}ice cream cake!

9
00:01:02,228 --> 00:01:03,480
[all laughing]

10
00:01:06,232 --> 00:01:08,777
<i>♪ We're on the edge of greatness ♪</i>

11
00:01:09,903 --> 00:01:12,072
<i>♪ Turning darkness to light ♪</i>

12
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:16,868
<i>♪ We're right beside you ready to fight ♪</i>

13
00:01:17,869 --> 00:01:20,205

00:01:20,288 --> 00:01:21,664

15
00:01:21,748 --> 00:01:23,374
<i>♪ And we must be brave ♪</i>

16

18
00:01:31,883 --> 00:01:33,593
<i>♪ We must be strong ♪</i>

19
00:01:39,724 --> 00:01:44,646
People are starting to arrive. I can't
believe this is really my coronation day.

20
00:01:45,271 --> 00:01:46,397
Me...

21
00:01:46,731 --> 00:01:47,899
Queen Glimmer.

22
00:01:48,358 --> 00:01:50,777
Ugh. It sounds so weird.

23
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:51,986
Queen Glimmer.

24
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:54,322
Queen Glimmer.

25
00:01:54,906 --> 00:01:59,536
Queen Glimmer! Yeah,
that's going to take some getting used to.

26
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:03,665
I just... never thought
it would actually happen.

27
00:02:03,748 --> 00:02:05,291
Hey, don't worry!

28
00:02:05,667 --> 00:02:08,336
You've got me and Bow
beside you all the way.

29
00:02:08,711 --> 00:02:10,839
We'll make sure this day is perfect.

30
00:02:12,173 --> 00:02:14,259
Yeah, you're right. We've got this.

31
00:02:15,009 --> 00:02:17,053
-Do I look okay?
-Like a queen.

32
00:02:17,178 --> 00:02:20,181
[Casta] Here you all are!
What are you standing around for?

33
00:02:20,265 --> 00:02:22,851
The guests are starting to arrive!
Come on!

34
00:02:22,934 --> 00:02:24,394
There's so much to do!

35
00:02:25,436 --> 00:02:26,646
[groaning]

36
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:33,319
-I'm worried about Glimmer.
-Must be hard with Angella being gone.

37
00:02:33,778 --> 00:02:37,490
It's her coronation.
This should be a perfect day for Glimmer.

38
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:41,661
We'll make it perfect.
All we have to do is keep her mind off--

39
00:02:41,744 --> 00:02:43,163
Angella?

40
00:02:43,746 --> 00:02:45,999
Off everything, yes. Now come on!

41
00:02:46,082 --> 00:02:46,916
[shouts]

42
00:02:47,542 --> 00:02:50,545
So, the ceremony begins
with the Ritual Quest,

43
00:02:50,753 --> 00:02:52,589
followed by your first speech as queen,

44
00:02:52,755 --> 00:02:56,634
and most importantly,
the whole thing ends with a Grand Ball!

45
00:02:56,718 --> 00:02:59,804
[gasps] Oh, there's a quest!
We're great at quests.

46
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:05,810
The Quest of Queens, in which Glimmer will
forge her connection to the Moonstone.

47
00:03:05,894 --> 00:03:08,688
The Moonstone's power has been balanced

48
00:03:08,813 --> 00:03:12,775
between you and your mother
since you were born, but now, with her...

49
00:03:13,192 --> 00:03:15,862
-Her absent...
-So, about that quest!

50
00:03:16,154 --> 00:03:17,906
We're great at quests, right?

51
00:03:17,989 --> 00:03:23,077
Yes, it's in the scrolls. Secret ritual,
witnesses, light, etcetera, etcetera.

52
00:03:23,202 --> 00:03:24,704
Oh, and you'll need this.

53
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:28,249
Are those the flower arrangements?

54
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:33,254
-Glimmer, what do you think?
-Oh, uh, they're, uh, fine?

55
00:03:33,796 --> 00:03:37,717
You're right, they're awful!
Burn them at once. Also, you're fired.

56
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,093
[crying]

57
00:03:39,177 --> 00:03:42,180
-Aunt Casta, you...
-[Casta] Don't you worry about a thing.

58
00:03:42,263 --> 00:03:48,561
In addition to being a powerful sorceress,
I am also a legendary party-planner.

59
00:03:49,145 --> 00:03:53,858
This will be a coronation for the ages!
Glimmer, take us to the terrace!

60
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,360
[sighs]

61
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:58,655
Oh, we're-- We're walking, are we? Great.

62
00:03:58,947 --> 00:04:00,365
We can use the exercise.

63
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:04,452
[Frosta] What do you think?

64
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:10,375
-I wanted to do something special for you.
-This is going to be awful.

65
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,418
[Frosta] Awful inspiring, right?

66
00:04:12,502 --> 00:04:16,464
-I can make more!
-I appreciate the idea.

67
00:04:16,631 --> 00:04:21,594
But I need someone for a very important
job to, uh, greet the guests.

68
00:04:21,803 --> 00:04:23,429
Oh! You need a bouncer?

69
00:04:24,472 --> 00:04:25,431
I'm on it!

70
00:04:25,515 --> 00:04:28,601
-Bouncer!
-Wait, I didn't say bouncer. Okay.

71
00:04:28,685 --> 00:04:31,688
Glimmer! I need your opinion
on color schemes.

72
00:04:31,896 --> 00:04:32,730
Uh...

73
00:04:32,814 --> 00:04:33,856
Blue?

74
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:37,026
What about purple?

75
00:04:38,027 --> 00:04:39,988
Excellent choice. Isn't this fun?

76
00:04:40,071 --> 00:04:44,284
Soon you will have to make many decisions,
just like your mother...

77
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:49,038
That is, uh-- Chop, chop, everyone!
Adora, move the ice sculpture to the side!

78
00:04:49,163 --> 00:04:52,500
We still need flower arrangements!
Where is that florist?

79
00:04:52,583 --> 00:04:54,794
-You fired him.
-Oh, right.

80
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:58,089
Perhaps you'd like to do the flowers,
Glimmer?

81
00:04:58,172 --> 00:04:59,007
Uh...

82
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:00,550
[grunting]

83
00:05:01,676 --> 00:05:03,344
Hmm. [groans]

84
00:05:03,428 --> 00:05:04,846
[Mermista groaning]

85
00:05:07,098 --> 00:05:11,436
You know, I bet Mermista
would love to do the flowers!

86
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:14,188
-Right, Mermista?
-Wow, how did you know?

87
00:05:14,605 --> 00:05:18,151
-Flower arranging is my passion.
-Ah! Wonderful!

88
00:05:18,234 --> 00:05:22,196
-Now let's talk stem length.
-[crying] What? No! Why?

89
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:25,074
Is now a good time to talk
about my song for the coronation?

90
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:28,911
I will require a stage,
and oats for the backup horses.

91
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:30,747
Stop bothering Glimmer!

92
00:05:31,122 --> 00:05:32,373
-Bouncer!
-Hey!

93
00:05:33,207 --> 00:05:36,169
I think it's all really coming together,
don't you?

94
00:05:36,252 --> 00:05:37,378
[glass breaking]

95
00:05:38,212 --> 00:05:42,341
Yep, it's gonna be perfect!
What else do we need to do, Bow?

96
00:05:42,425 --> 00:05:46,971
Still don't know what the lantern is for!
This is so official and confusing.

97
00:05:47,055 --> 00:05:50,016
It says Glimmer needs to wear
some ceremonial robe.

98
00:05:50,391 --> 00:05:53,686
-I don't know where to get that!
-Maybe if we all looked together--

99
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:56,397
-Don't worry! We will find it!
-But--

100
00:05:56,481 --> 00:06:00,568
Glimmer, you're needed in the Dining Room
to choose the napkin folding technique!

101
00:06:00,651 --> 00:06:03,154
-I'm thinking swans, what do you think?
-Uh...

102
00:06:03,237 --> 00:06:04,864
You're right, it's a terrible idea.

103
00:06:04,947 --> 00:06:07,492
-I should just fire myself.
-Aunt Casta, no--

104
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,286
[both grunt]

105
00:06:10,369 --> 00:06:12,330
Mermista! Vases!

106
00:06:12,413 --> 00:06:14,582
Don't stifle my creativity!

107
00:06:14,665 --> 00:06:18,544
-Ugh. Please.
-It's okay, we will handle everything.

108
00:06:18,753 --> 00:06:20,213
You go have fun!

109
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:23,132
Fun. Right.

110
00:06:43,194 --> 00:06:47,031
Hordak. Our troops are just sitting
around. What are we waiting for?

111
00:06:47,115 --> 00:06:49,534
-We need to talk about plans for--
-Plans?

112
00:06:49,951 --> 00:06:50,952
[laughing]

113
00:06:51,202 --> 00:06:56,207
Your last plan was to set off
the portal machine before it was ready.

114
00:06:56,624 --> 00:06:59,127
Do you remember how that ended?

115
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:01,587
Whatever. It worked out for us, didn't it?

116
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:04,215
The Rebellion's a mess.
Their queen is gone.

117
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:06,425
Now's our chance to gain the upper hand.

118
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:11,222
And how are we going to do that when
you couldn't even prevent the Rebellion

119
00:07:11,305 --> 00:07:13,558
from infiltrating the Fright Zone?

120
00:07:13,641 --> 00:07:16,394
Yeah, like I said before,
it was Entrapta who--

121
00:07:16,477 --> 00:07:17,311
[shouting]

122
00:07:19,063 --> 00:07:23,860
I told you never to mention that name
in my presence!

123
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:27,864
If you are so desperate for a task,
redouble our defenses

124
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:32,952
so that no Princess can ever set foot
in the Fright Zone again.

125
00:07:33,035 --> 00:07:36,914
Fortunately for you,
my signal to Horde Prime went through.

126
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:38,291
Great, so--

127
00:07:38,374 --> 00:07:44,213
That's the only reason you're here instead
of facing punishment for your failure.

128
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:47,800
Now get out!

129
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:05,818
Well, it took some searching, but we
finally found the Royal Coronation Robe!

130
00:08:06,527 --> 00:08:08,362
[Adora] Wow, Glimmer!

131
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:10,156
You look...

132
00:08:10,823 --> 00:08:11,741
Um...

133
00:08:14,452 --> 00:08:16,412
Oh, my little Glimmer.

134
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:18,289
I'm so proud of you.

135
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:21,834
I know you're going to make
such a wonderful queen.

136
00:08:23,544 --> 00:08:28,174
Almost time for your quest! Give me a tick
and this robe will fit like a dream!

137
00:08:29,967 --> 00:08:33,012
Of course. The quest we still
don't know anything about.

138
00:08:33,095 --> 00:08:36,307
But it'll be fine. Castaspella will fix
the robe, Bow has the lantern,

139
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:38,976
and I'll have you guys by my side
the whole way. Right?

140
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:39,936
Um...

141
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:40,853
Right!

142
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:43,856
Hey, um, Adora,
can I talk to you real quick?

143
00:08:44,982 --> 00:08:47,235
I don't know where the lantern is!

144
00:08:47,318 --> 00:08:50,905
Glimmer can't do the quest without it,
and she can't be queen without the quest!

145
00:08:51,489 --> 00:08:55,201
-I've doomed the entire kingdom!
-Bow, calm down!

146
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:59,205
We just have to find the lantern,
and Glimmer will be none the wiser.

147
00:08:59,455 --> 00:09:02,041
It has to be around here somewhere, right?

148
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:04,752
This day is going to be perfect!

149
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:15,304
[Shadow Weaver]
There's no need to be alarmed.

150
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:16,722
I'm a guest now.

151
00:09:17,139 --> 00:09:18,057
Can't you tell?

152
00:09:18,849 --> 00:09:24,855
Please, convey my best wishes to our
new queen. I hope you two are still close.

153
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:27,275
Power changes people.

154
00:09:27,358 --> 00:09:30,861
Glimmer is a good friend.
She'll be a good queen, too.

155
00:09:31,862 --> 00:09:35,283
[Shadow Weaver]
Hmm. I hope for your sake, you're right.

156
00:09:38,202 --> 00:09:41,205
Adora, I've been freezing anyone
trying to sneak in,

157
00:09:41,455 --> 00:09:43,916
but I'm running out of space to put them.

158
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:46,961
Unfreeze him right now!

159
00:09:47,044 --> 00:09:48,337
[grunting]

160
00:09:49,005 --> 00:09:50,047
[humming]

161
00:09:52,633 --> 00:09:55,386
Mermista, um,
flowers are sort of my thing.

162
00:09:56,512 --> 00:09:59,599
Uh, it's art and it's what Glimmer wants.

163
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:01,225
New queen, new era.

164
00:10:01,517 --> 00:10:05,229
[grunting] Stop fighting!
You're ruining Glimmer's big day!

165
00:10:05,521 --> 00:10:09,066
-Bouncer!
-Okay, has anyone seen a sacred lantern?

166
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:11,027
[Mermista] Yeah. There.

167
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:12,361
[chuckles]

168
00:10:13,362 --> 00:10:14,989
-[sighs]
-Oh!

169
