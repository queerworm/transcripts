1
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:19,019
{\an8}Uh, hey, guys?

2
00:00:19,102 --> 00:00:24,274
{\an8}I got an invite for the All-Princess Ball,
Winter Wonderland.

3
00:00:24,357 --> 00:00:28,028
{\an8}-Do you know what this is?
-[both] Princess Prom!

4
00:00:28,361 --> 00:00:33,241
{\an8}Princess Prom! Princess Prom!
We are going to Princess Prom!

5
00:00:33,324 --> 00:00:36,536
{\an8}Okay, you've gone crazy, got it.
I'll just come back later.

6
00:00:36,619 --> 00:00:40,165
{\an8}The All-Princess Ball is a meeting
of all the princesses of Etheria.

7
00:00:40,248 --> 00:00:41,875
And a giant party!

8
00:00:42,459 --> 00:00:46,046
-Dancing, food, fancy dresses.
-Dancing?

9
00:00:46,129 --> 00:00:49,841
It only happens once a decade.
I've been waiting years for this!

10
00:00:49,924 --> 00:00:52,135
Uh... But you know, I'm--

11
00:00:52,218 --> 00:00:55,221
I'm only a princess sometimes.
Are you sure I should even go?

12
00:00:55,305 --> 00:01:00,185
Of course. Every princess is invited.
That includes you.

13
00:01:00,268 --> 00:01:02,312
Oh, yeah. It's all in the invite.

14
00:01:05,565 --> 00:01:07,400
Okay. "Rules for greeting the hostess.

15
00:01:07,484 --> 00:01:12,030
Expected curtsy depth.
Proper stair-descending etiquette"?

16
00:01:12,113 --> 00:01:14,282
The Ball has been going on for centuries.

17
00:01:14,365 --> 00:01:17,327
There's a lot of old etiquette stuff
you gotta do before you can party.

18
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:19,621
But it's gonna be so fun!

19
00:01:19,704 --> 00:01:23,500
And Princess Frosta is hosting this year
in the Kingdom of Snows.

20
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:29,297
Her magic is incredibly powerful.
She'd be a huge get for the Rebellion.

21
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:30,256
[whimpers]

22
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:32,675
Don't worry. I'll be right there with you,

23
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:35,178
and so will Bow,
since he's going as my plus one.

24
00:01:35,261 --> 00:01:36,888
Uh... Actually...

25
00:01:36,971 --> 00:01:39,516
Together, the three of us
can handle anything.

26
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:43,978
-About that...
-It's the best friend squad in action.

27
00:01:44,062 --> 00:01:46,731
-Right, Bow?
-I'm going with Perfuma.

28
00:01:46,815 --> 00:01:48,066
What?

29
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:51,778
<i>♪ We're on the edge of greatness ♪</i>

30
00:01:52,737 --> 00:01:55,156

00:02:14,717 --> 00:02:16,678

38
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:22,100
I'm sick of this.

39
00:02:22,183 --> 00:02:25,061
Shadow Weaver failed to get Adora,
and if Hordak finds out

40
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:27,647
she's disobeying him,
she'll take us down with her.

41
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:30,066
She's obsessed.
We need to think big picture.

42
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:33,278
It's time for someone new
to take over-- me.

43
00:02:33,361 --> 00:02:36,281
-So, you in?
-I'm hanging out in your room! [chuckles]

44
00:02:36,364 --> 00:02:38,700
Unfortunately, you're the only one
I can trust around here.

45
00:02:38,783 --> 00:02:40,285
Because we're best friends.

46
00:02:40,368 --> 00:02:43,037
Stop being so you and help me think.

47
00:02:43,121 --> 00:02:45,748
I have the beginning of a plan,
but it's not enough.

48
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:48,543
I need to capture Adora
so Shadow Weaver doesn't demote me.

49
00:02:48,626 --> 00:02:51,379
I need to impress Hordak
so he'll make me the new Shadow Weaver.

50
00:02:51,462 --> 00:02:52,714
How do I do both?

51
00:02:53,798 --> 00:02:56,009
Why don't you try something
at the All-Princess Ball?

52
00:02:56,092 --> 00:02:59,220
Every princess is gonna be there,
so Adora probably will be too.

53
00:02:59,304 --> 00:03:02,557
Ooh! This year's theme
is Winter Wonderland.

54
00:03:02,974 --> 00:03:06,269
-How did you get your claws on this?
-They sent it to me. I'm a princess.

55
00:03:06,352 --> 00:03:09,522
-You're a princess?
-Yeah, you know.

56
00:03:09,731 --> 00:03:12,233
The Horde crash-landed
in my family's kingdom.

57
00:03:12,317 --> 00:03:13,318
We let them stay.

58
00:03:13,401 --> 00:03:16,487
My family gave Hordak
our Runestone, the Black Garnet.

59
00:03:16,571 --> 00:03:18,448
You're a princess?

60
00:03:18,531 --> 00:03:20,325
Oh, man, I thought everyone knew.

61
00:03:20,408 --> 00:03:22,577
I mean, it's covered
in Force Captain orientation.

62
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:25,121
I'm beginning to think
I shouldn't have skipped that.

63
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:27,916
Okay, you're a princess
and you're going to a Princess Ball.

64
00:03:27,999 --> 00:03:29,751
Oh, no, I'm not going. No.

65
00:03:29,834 --> 00:03:32,337
No one liked my family,
even before we joined the Horde.

66
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:36,925
Ah... I never really fit
with the other princesses.

67
00:03:37,008 --> 00:03:40,136
I made them uncomfortable and...
Yeah, they don't like that.

68
00:03:40,595 --> 00:03:41,804
They don't like me.

69
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:44,807
And that's exactly why you have to go.

70
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:47,852
How dare those princesses pretend
they're better than you?

71
00:03:47,936 --> 00:03:49,354
Just because you're different?

72
00:03:49,437 --> 00:03:51,981
How dare they abandon people
just because they don't fit in

73
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:54,234
-with their perfect little lives?
-Yeah!

74
00:03:54,317 --> 00:03:59,197
How dare they take best friends
and turn them into giant sword ladies

75
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:02,242
who run off with people
clearly inferior to you?

76
00:04:02,325 --> 00:04:05,245
You're telling my whole life
with your words.

77
00:04:05,328 --> 00:04:08,581
Well, time to show those princesses
a thing or two.

78
00:04:08,665 --> 00:04:11,084
You're going, I'm coming as your plus one,

79
00:04:11,167 --> 00:04:15,088
and we are going to make this
a night no one will ever forget.

80
00:04:15,171 --> 00:04:17,715
Super Pal Duo is going to Prom!

81
00:04:18,633 --> 00:04:21,844
She asked and I said yes.
I didn't think it would be a big deal.

82
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:23,846
It's not. It's fine.

83
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:27,684
I'm just surprised.<i> </i>I mean,
when did you two even talk about it?

84
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:29,602
Oh. She was super slick.

85
00:04:30,395 --> 00:04:31,688
[grunting]

86
00:04:33,064 --> 00:04:35,817
-Wanna go to the Ball with me?
-Okay!

87
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:36,943
[grunting]

88
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:41,739
-That's super slick?
-I thought it'd be fun.

89
00:04:41,823 --> 00:04:44,701
-And Perfume's cool.
-Yeah, she's fine.

90
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:47,829
But we always go to events together.
We have all our routine,

91
00:04:47,912 --> 00:04:50,540
we wear matching outfits,
we share inside jokes.

92
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:53,835
And then we eat ice cream afterwards.
It's our thing.

93
00:04:53,918 --> 00:04:56,170
Well, there's nothing wrong
with a new thing.

94
00:04:56,254 --> 00:04:59,257
Look, I gotta get ready.
We'll hang out with you guys there.

95
00:05:00,883 --> 00:05:03,344
-But I liked our old thing.
-Glimmer!

96
00:05:03,428 --> 00:05:05,513
-Good. No time to waste.
-[shouts]

97
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:12,603
I've been studying the invite.
Advance prep will be key to success.

98
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:14,731
I've divided the rules into base parts.

99
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:17,525
Dance rules, etiquette rules,
rules for greeting the hostess.

100
00:05:17,608 --> 00:05:20,320
[clears throat] I then broke down
the ballroom into quadrants

101
00:05:20,403 --> 00:05:23,031
and I'm familiarizing myself
with targets. Ask me anything.

102
00:05:23,114 --> 00:05:25,867
-Princess Frosta.
-Ruler of the Kingdom of Snows.

103
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:27,285
First time hosting the ball,

104
00:05:27,368 --> 00:05:30,788
biggest kingdom outside Bright Moon,
neutral in the fight against the Horde.

105
00:05:30,872 --> 00:05:33,624
Allies with the Star Sisters,
who are friends with Mermista,

106
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:35,668
but not Sweet Bee,
who is dating Peekablue,

107
00:05:35,752 --> 00:05:37,045
as you can tell from the string.

108
00:05:37,128 --> 00:05:41,841
Up means friends, down means frenemies.
And also I made an obstacle course.

109
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:45,345
I'm feeling good! I've prepared
for any and all possible scenarios.

110
00:05:45,428 --> 00:05:49,390
-I am so ready for this Ball.
-Great! What are you wearing?

111
00:05:49,807 --> 00:05:53,144
I was gonna just go as She-Ra.
She has better hair.

112
00:05:53,227 --> 00:05:55,396
Well, you can't go as She-Ra.

113
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:59,525
They have a strict no weapons rule.
Neutral ground and all.

114
00:05:59,609 --> 00:06:01,611
You'll have to leave your sword
at the door.

115
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:04,405
Ugh. How are there
still more parts to this invite?

116
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:06,366
[gasps] You know what this means?

117
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:08,951
That clothes aren't important
and I should just keep studying?

118
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:11,913
It's makeover time!

119
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:13,414
Whoa.

120
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:14,791
[pop music playing]

121
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:29,680
[both laughing]

122
00:06:34,352 --> 00:06:35,520
[laughs]

123
00:06:37,688 --> 00:06:38,773
[shouts]

124
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:44,737
Yeah!

125
00:06:45,696 --> 00:06:46,697
Huh?

126
00:06:49,325 --> 00:06:50,284
[gasps]

127
00:07:10,471 --> 00:07:11,514
[gasps]

128
00:07:16,144 --> 00:07:17,311
[laughing]

129
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:23,651
Be careful with it.

130
00:07:23,734 --> 00:07:25,945
Don't just lean it somewhere
with the other swords,

131
00:07:26,028 --> 00:07:29,073
-or it might get confused!
-Adora, come on!

132
00:07:32,493 --> 00:07:33,578
Whoa, heh.

133
00:07:34,078 --> 00:07:36,581
-It's big.
-[pop music playing on speakers]

134
00:07:37,832 --> 00:07:40,543
[Glimmer] The Ball is one
of our most an ancient traditions.

135
00:07:40,626 --> 00:07:44,213
A princess's first Ball
is a huge rite of passage.

136
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:48,926
-Plus, the Kingdom of Snows is really big.
-Which is why we need Frosta.

137
00:07:49,385 --> 00:07:52,263
If she joins us, all the other princesses
are sure to follow.

138
00:07:53,514 --> 00:07:54,515
[sighs]

139
00:07:54,724 --> 00:07:55,600
Here we go.

140
00:07:57,935 --> 00:07:59,020
[music stops]

141
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:02,940
Hold for one, two, and three.

142
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:09,947
That's Frosta? But she's, like, ten.

143
00:08:10,031 --> 00:08:11,532
[crowd gasping]

144
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:14,619
I'm 11 and three quarters.

145
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:20,416
Revered hostess. We come into your hall
under the ancient rules of hospitality,

146
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:25,505
bringing greetings from Bright Moon.
And She-Ra, the legendary warrior.

147
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:26,589
[crowd chattering]

148
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:31,677
You are welcome in the Kingdom of Snows
under the ancient rules of hospitality.

149
00:08:31,969 --> 00:08:35,598
Leave conflict at the door.
And please enjoy the Ball.

150
00:08:35,681 --> 00:08:38,893
Thank you, Your-- [shouts] Majesty.

151
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:41,771
Couldn't have mentioned she was a kid?

152
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:44,440
You did all that research,
I assumed you knew!

153
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:46,484
You know what? It's fine.

154
00:08:46,567 --> 00:08:49,195
There's plenty of time still
to win her over.

155
00:08:49,278 --> 00:08:51,489
Come on, let's rock this Ball!

156
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:54,033
[pop music playing on speakers]

157
00:08:56,494 --> 00:08:58,454
Oh! There's Entrapta! Heh.

158
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:02,542
Adora! Glimmer!

159
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:05,211
Are you here to watch
the social experiment, too?

160
00:09:05,294 --> 00:09:06,546
Social experiment?

161
00:09:06,963 --> 00:09:11,425
Different groups are thrown together
and forced to mingle.

162
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:13,344
Hierarchies form and break.

163
00:09:13,427 --> 00:09:15,888
It's the perfect place
to observe behavior.

164
00:09:15,972 --> 00:09:18,307
And they have tiny food.

165
00:09:20,643 --> 00:09:22,728
Where's Bow? I wanna show him
my new recorder.

166
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:24,605
He's coming later.

167
00:09:24,689 --> 00:09:26,983
Why didn't he come with you?
Aren't you friends?

168
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:29,986
-Why would you think we're not?
-There he is! Bow!

169
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:40,204
They're matching.
That's <i>our</i> best friend thing!

170
00:09:40,288 --> 00:09:42,540
Feelings seem to be getting hurt.

171
00:09:42,623 --> 00:09:45,251
Hey, I'm here too.
Don't make a big thing out of it.

172
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:48,129
[both laughing]

173
00:09:50,756 --> 00:09:53,551
They're making up their own inside jokes?

174
00:09:53,634 --> 00:09:56,929
What? Is Perfuma his new best friend now?

175
00:09:57,013 --> 00:09:59,557
Not gonna get into
whatever's happening there.

176
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,350
[whispering]
People walk around in circles.

177
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:03,352
Or that. Look, have you seen--?

178
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:06,188
[singing]
♪ <i>She's a beauty, can't you see ♪</i>

179
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:08,983
<i>♪ She's attending this with me ♪</i>

180
00:10:09,066 --> 00:10:11,986
<i>♪ She's my Princess of the Sea ♪</i>

181
00:10:12,069 --> 00:10:13,988
<i>♪ Mermista ♪</i>

182
00:10:14,071 --> 00:10:15,531
Oh, hey, it's my crew.

183
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:19,118
So, Sea Hawk's your plus one?

184
00:10:19,535 --> 00:10:22,788
No. He is just my ride, okay?

185
00:10:22,872 --> 00:10:24,915
Just my ride.

186
00:10:24,999 --> 00:10:28,044
[laughs] Of course.
[whispers] I am her plus one.

187
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:31,088
This is the best social experiment
I've ever been to!

188
00:10:31,172 --> 00:10:35,217
-Whatever. Do they have a kelp bar?
-To the buffet!

189
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:36,969
-Advent-- Oh, hi, Bow.
-[gasps]

190
00:10:40,097 --> 00:10:44,143
-Hey--
-[laughs] That's so funny, Adora!

191
00:10:44,226 --> 00:10:48,731
What a funny inside joke
the two of us just came up with!

192
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:52,401
The She-Ra, Glimmer.
It's great to see you.

193
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:55,780
[chuckles] Perfuma was just telling me
about a winged horse

194
00:10:55,863 --> 00:10:59,075
that ate all the apples in Plumeria
and then flew away.

195
00:10:59,158 --> 00:11:01,702
-Sound familiar?
-Sure, whatever. Isn't this fun?

196
00:11:01,786 --> 00:11:04,955
Adora and I are having
such a great time here together.

197
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:07,166
Just the two of us. Right, Adora?

198
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:13,255
Okay. Uh, we're gonna say hi to people.
You wanna come?

199
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:16,509
No, you guys go on. We'll find you later.

200
00:11:16,592 --> 00:11:19,095
I wanna hear the rest
of this hilarious story

201
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:20,846
that Adora was just telling.

202
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:26,102
Oh, perfect. Frosta's alone.

203
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:29,105
I'm gonna try to smooth things over
with her. Coming?

204
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:30,314
[laughing]

205
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:33,234
Okay, never mind. I'll just be right back.

206
00:11:34,402 --> 00:11:35,861
Revered hostess.

207
00:11:37,613 --> 00:11:40,700
I've come to apologize for earlier.
I was so rude.

208
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:42,368
Yes, you were.

209
00:11:42,451 --> 00:11:44,954
But as you're only an honorary princess,

210
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:47,039
you can't be expected to know better.

211
00:11:47,998 --> 00:11:50,251
Your kingdom is truly beautiful,
Princess Frosta.

212
00:11:50,334 --> 00:11:53,170
-I'm honored to be here.
-[Frosta] Thank you.

213
00:11:53,254 --> 00:11:55,965
And now I expect you're going to ask me
to join your Rebellion?

214
00:11:56,424 --> 00:11:57,717
You know about that?

215
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:00,803
Of course I do. Princesses talk, you know?

216
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:05,850
The snow peas and the cookies
are touching. Do it right.

217
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:09,395
Princess Frosta, the Rebellion needs you.

218
00:12:09,478 --> 00:12:12,148
Your kingdom is the largest
and most powerful.

219
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:14,734
Your alliance could be the key
to defeating the Horde.

220
00:12:14,817 --> 00:12:16,861
The Horde hasn't threatened us here.

221
00:12:16,944 --> 00:12:18,571
Only because the Kingdom of Snows

222
00:12:18,654 --> 00:12:21,115
is so out of the way
it doesn't matter to Hordak right now.

223
00:12:21,198 --> 00:12:23,159
Joining the Rebellion
is obviously your best bet.

224
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:26,203
The Kingdom of Snows
has defended itself perfectly well

225
00:12:26,287 --> 00:12:28,122
for thousands of years.

226
00:12:28,497 --> 00:12:31,500
We do not need your help
or your Rebellion.

227
00:12:33,711 --> 00:12:35,921
Please continue to enjoy the Ball.

228
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:40,384
[all laughing]

229
00:12:40,468 --> 00:12:41,844
[Bow] Perfuma was just telling me

230
00:12:41,927 --> 00:12:45,139
about a winged horse
that ate all the apples in Plumeria!

231
00:12:45,222 --> 00:12:46,307
Where have you been?

232
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:48,559
[groans] I told you, winning over Frosta.

233
00:12:48,642 --> 00:12:51,437
Actually, scratch that.
Failing to win over Frosta.

234
00:12:53,689 --> 00:12:54,815
Are you okay?

235
00:12:56,984 --> 00:12:58,778
Why does it bother you so much?

236
00:12:58,861 --> 00:13:02,198
It doesn't! Bow can hang out
with whoever he wants. I just...

237
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:05,993
[groans] I never had
that many friends, okay?

238
00:13:06,076 --> 00:13:08,871
It's always just been me and Bow.

239
00:13:08,954 --> 00:13:12,833
But now, what if he likes
his new friends better than me?

240
00:13:12,917 --> 00:13:16,128
-What if everyone does?
-That's not gonna happen, Glimmer.

241
00:13:16,212 --> 00:13:20,216
Trust me, Bow isn't the type to just leave
his old friends behind, and neither am...

242
00:13:25,179 --> 00:13:26,138
I.

243
00:13:29,517 --> 00:13:32,770
Revered hostess, you can't let them in.
They're from the Horde.

244
00:13:32,853 --> 00:13:34,480
Revered Hostess,

245
00:13:34,563 --> 00:13:37,983
Princess Scorpia was invited,
as per the rules of this Ball.

246
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:41,237
Rules which I personally have
the utmost respect for.

247
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,656
-You do not!
-[Frosta] Princess Adora.

248
00:13:43,739 --> 00:13:46,075
The rules state clearly
that all princesses

249
00:13:46,158 --> 00:13:48,077
and their chosen guests are welcome.

250
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:51,163
They're up to something, I can feel it.
You have to--

251
00:13:51,247 --> 00:13:54,792
That's enough!
You look at me and see a child,

252
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:57,419
but I have worked
too hard to gain respect,

253
00:13:57,503 --> 00:14:01,674
only to throw it away
because you feel they're up to something.

254
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:05,094
For centuries, the All-Princess Ball
has been neutral ground.

255
00:14:05,177 --> 00:14:07,221
I will not dishonor that legacy.

256
00:14:07,304 --> 00:14:12,309
Scorpia is a princess.
Princesses get plus ones. They stay.

257
00:14:13,143 --> 00:14:14,019
[Adora] Hmm.

258
00:14:14,645 --> 00:14:15,521
[gasps]

259
00:14:16,438 --> 00:14:17,731
[both grunting]

260
00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:20,150
Teenagers.

261
00:14:20,234 --> 00:14:22,778
Really, Adora? I'm shocked.

262
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:25,948
We're not breaking any rules.
Didn't you read the invite?

263
00:14:26,031 --> 00:14:27,700
I know you're plotting something.

264
00:14:27,783 --> 00:14:31,036
From now to the second the ball ends,
I'll be watching.

265
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,706
Wherever the two of you go, I go.

266
00:14:34,957 --> 00:14:38,210
Suit yourself. Have fun with following us!

267
00:14:38,961 --> 00:14:43,173
[grumbles] Glimmer, you get Scorpia,
I'll take Catra.

268
00:14:43,257 --> 00:14:44,842
[pop music playing]

269
00:14:57,479 --> 00:14:58,439
[woman] Oh!

270
00:14:58,981 --> 00:15:00,357
[crowd gasping]

271
00:15:03,819 --> 00:15:04,695
[sighs]

272
00:15:07,823 --> 00:15:09,074
[chuckles]

273
00:15:15,164 --> 00:15:17,833
[Scorpia] Mm. Mm. Wow, that is good.

274
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:21,378
Oh, what is--?
I don't even know what's in this.

275
00:15:21,462 --> 00:15:24,131
What? Sir? <i>Garçon?</i> What's in this?

276
00:15:24,673 --> 00:15:25,883
Bow! Wait up!

277
00:15:25,966 --> 00:15:27,593
Glimmer. Hi.

278
00:15:27,676 --> 00:15:29,511
There's something I need to tell you.

279
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:32,765
I know things between us
have been weird all night.

280
00:15:32,848 --> 00:15:34,516
So, I just wanted to say--

281
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:37,311
-It's all right. I accept your--
-I forgive you.

282
00:15:37,895 --> 00:15:39,813
You forgive me?

283
00:15:39,897 --> 00:15:42,399
Glimmer, I'm allowed
to hang out with other people.

284
00:15:42,483 --> 00:15:45,402
Bow, don't you see? That's how it starts!

285
00:15:45,486 --> 00:15:49,114
Then suddenly everyone has new friends
and nobody needs me anymore,

286
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:52,493
-and then I'm all alone!
-What are you talking about?

287
00:15:52,576 --> 00:15:56,664
You have me, plus Adora,
and everyone who joined the Rebellion.

288
00:15:56,747 --> 00:15:58,582
That's what I'm talking about!

289
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:02,920
It used to be the two of us,
and now everything's changing!

290
00:16:03,003 --> 00:16:04,838
I don't want you to leave me behind.

291
00:16:04,922 --> 00:16:07,299
No one is leaving you behind.

292
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:10,928
I wanted to hang out with you and Adora
and Perfuma tonight,

293
00:16:11,011 --> 00:16:13,347
but you're the one who keeps
being weird and leaving.

294
00:16:13,764 --> 00:16:17,559
I know change is scary, Glimmer,
but you don't get to take it out on me.

295
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:20,437
Now, if you'll excuse me,

296
00:16:20,521 --> 00:16:23,899
I am going to get my cummerbund,
because it's freezing in here.

297
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:25,567
We'll talk later, okay?

298
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:29,029
[gasps]

299
00:16:36,704 --> 00:16:40,165
-Princess Prom. Hour two...
-Don't touch her!

300
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:41,667
[yells]

301
00:16:42,876 --> 00:16:46,463
You're right. This is a much better
vantage point for my observations.

302
00:16:46,547 --> 00:16:47,423
Hi, Adora.

303
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:49,925
Have you met my new assistant?
She brought snacks.

304
00:16:51,343 --> 00:16:54,430
She stole my food, and then asked me
to spy on people with her.

305
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:56,015
Is this what love feels like?

306
00:16:59,643 --> 00:17:01,937
Entrapta, she's from the Horde.

307
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:08,110
The people the Rebellion are fighting?
The Rebellion you're a part of.

308
00:17:08,193 --> 00:17:10,279
Oh. Well, in that case,

309
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:13,115
we should keep a better eye on her.
She just walked away.

310
00:17:14,616 --> 00:17:15,701
[groans]

311
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:29,381
Is that a...? [gasps] Oh, no!

312
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:33,552
Princess Scorpia is planting heat bombs!
We have to stop her!

313
00:17:34,803 --> 00:17:36,305
[footsteps approaching]

314
00:17:38,098 --> 00:17:41,060
What are you doing? Let me go! Let--

315
00:17:47,316 --> 00:17:50,277
It is my solemn duty as hostess
to now announce,

316
00:17:50,694 --> 00:17:53,238
it is time for the first dance
of the ball.

317
00:17:53,322 --> 00:17:54,823
-[all cheering]
-[shouts]

318
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:56,825
[pop music playing over speakers]

319
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:03,332
[groans]

320
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:11,882
I don't know about you,
but I am having a blast.

321
00:18:11,965 --> 00:18:14,593
Whatever it is you're planning,
it won't work.

322
00:18:14,676 --> 00:18:15,677
You sure?

323
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:20,766
[sobs] I got into a fight with Bow,

324
00:18:20,849 --> 00:18:22,810
and he won't wanna be friends
with me anymore

325
00:18:22,893 --> 00:18:24,353
and I don't know where Scorpia is!

326
00:18:24,436 --> 00:18:27,689
-What? Glimmer, don't--
-Have you seen Bow?

327
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:30,359
He went to get his cummerbund,
but that was a while ago.

328
00:18:30,442 --> 00:18:32,736
Right about the same time
that Horde Princess left.

329
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:36,615
Wait, do you mean Scorpia?
Glimmer, when did you last see Bow?

330
00:18:36,698 --> 00:18:39,243
A while ago. Isn't he with Perfuma?

331
00:18:39,326 --> 00:18:42,079
No. Perfuma says he's been gone
this entire time.

332
00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:46,458
Maybe my plan won't work.
But then again...

333
00:18:47,918 --> 00:18:49,545
maybe it already has.

334
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:54,716
Say, where's your friend Bow?

335
00:18:55,592 --> 00:18:57,636
[groaning then shouting]

336
00:18:59,221 --> 00:19:01,223
-[crowd gasping]
-Oh, no.

337
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:05,310
-What did you do to him?
-[laughs] Nothing permanent.

338
00:19:06,103 --> 00:19:09,606
-[woman] How dare she?
-Tell me what you did with him--

339
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:10,774
[grunting]

340
00:19:13,443 --> 00:19:14,778
Revered hostess, she's got--

341
00:19:14,862 --> 00:19:19,449
Princess Ball is a ceremony of unity.
Violence is strictly forbidden.

342
00:19:19,533 --> 00:19:23,287
-You don't understand.
-I understand perfectly.

343
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:27,374
As hostess, in accordance with the rules
set down over the centuries,

344
00:19:27,457 --> 00:19:30,794
I hereby revoke your invitation.

345
00:19:30,878 --> 00:19:33,672
You are to leave my kingdom
and never, ever--

346
00:19:33,755 --> 00:19:35,591
[all gasping and shouting]

347
00:19:41,305 --> 00:19:43,765
Remain calm! Stop!

348
00:19:45,893 --> 00:19:48,937
Glimmer! Catra has Bow.
You have to find him now!

349
00:19:52,065 --> 00:19:54,067
Catra. What did you do?

350
00:19:54,151 --> 00:19:59,114
I did nothing. Scorpia, Lonnie, and Kyle,
on the other hand, were very busy.

351
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:03,118
-It was fun distracting you, though.
-This isn't a game!

352
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:05,078
People are gonna get hurt.

353
00:20:05,162 --> 00:20:07,539
It's never been a game to me.

354
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:11,084
I'm after something bigger,
and no one is going to stop me.

355
00:20:11,752 --> 00:20:12,836
[grunting]

356
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:16,673
[grunting]

357
00:20:18,842 --> 00:20:20,594
Bow? Bow!

358
00:20:20,677 --> 00:20:22,429
Where are you? [gasps]

359
00:20:24,806 --> 00:20:26,391
Get away from him!

360
00:20:26,475 --> 00:20:27,559
[shouting]

361
00:20:32,314 --> 00:20:33,732
-No!
-[thud]

362
00:20:38,654 --> 00:20:39,613
[shouts]

363
00:20:49,706 --> 00:20:51,458
[shouting]

364
00:20:57,339 --> 00:20:58,590
[grunting]

365
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:04,846
[Sea Hawk] Ooh.

366
00:21:12,646 --> 00:21:14,147
Ha. Trapped.

367
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:16,275
You wish.

368
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:17,859
[grunting]

369
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:23,907
[grunts]

370
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:26,827
[grunting and shouting]

371
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:34,126
-Ha!
-[screams]

372
00:21:57,024 --> 00:21:58,108
[both screaming]

373
00:22:08,702 --> 00:22:10,996
Hang on! I can get us out of this.

374
00:22:11,079 --> 00:22:14,249
Oh, Adora, I don't want you to.

375
00:22:15,208 --> 00:22:17,044
[gasps] Catra!

376
00:22:26,636 --> 00:22:27,512
[gasps]

377
00:22:30,223 --> 00:22:31,808
[laughs]

378
00:22:32,142 --> 00:22:34,603
See you later, princess.

379
00:22:37,731 --> 00:22:39,024
[sobbing]
