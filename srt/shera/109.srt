[laughing]

2
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:23,606
{\an8}Check this thing out.

3
00:00:24,357 --> 00:00:27,485
{\an8}You've got to admit, Shadow Weaver,
in a single mission,

4
00:00:27,569 --> 00:00:30,822
{\an8}I inflicted more damage on the Rebellion
than anyone else.

5
00:00:30,905 --> 00:00:34,534
I succeeded where even you failed.

6
00:00:37,954 --> 00:00:40,749
-Shadow Weaver.
-[Shadow Weaver] My Lord.

7
00:00:40,832 --> 00:00:44,252
{\an8}I commend you on the capture
of the Princess of Bright Moon.

8
00:00:44,335 --> 00:00:47,922
{\an8}Queen Angella has been given
until the morning's moonrise

9
00:00:48,006 --> 00:00:50,050
{\an8}to surrender herself to our forces.

10
00:00:50,133 --> 00:00:51,885
{\an8}Thank you, Lord Hordak.

11
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:54,512
{\an8}I thought you would be pleased
with my work.

12
00:00:54,596 --> 00:00:57,599
You have proven your worth to me. Today.

13
00:00:58,933 --> 00:01:03,605
Your worth? I'm the one who brought back
the Princess of Bright Moon. Not you.

14
00:01:03,688 --> 00:01:05,857
[Shadow Weaver]
You're under my command, Force Captain.

15
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:09,736
Therefore, anything you manage to do right
is credited to me.

16
00:01:09,819 --> 00:01:15,408
-So I do the work and you get the glory?
-Sometimes that's just the way of things.

17
00:01:20,705 --> 00:01:21,915
[groaning]

18
00:01:24,584 --> 00:01:29,672

[Angella] I should've never let her
leave this castle.

30
00:02:09,379 --> 00:02:12,632
And now, I'm faced
with an impossible decision.

31
00:02:12,715 --> 00:02:16,845
As leader of the Rebellion,
how can I surrender myself to our enemy?

32
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:19,973
And yet, as a mother, how do I--?

33
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:21,474
[sighs]

34
00:02:23,017 --> 00:02:27,272
I'm going to accept Hordak's terms.
Glimmer is all I have.

35
00:02:27,355 --> 00:02:31,359
You can't. We have no guarantee the Horde
will hold up their end of the bargain.

36
00:02:31,442 --> 00:02:33,111
We could end up losing you, too.

37
00:02:33,194 --> 00:02:35,280
A rescue attempt is too risky.

38
00:02:35,363 --> 00:02:39,826
If we had She-Ra we might have a chance,
but without the Sword of Protection...

39
00:02:40,201 --> 00:02:44,706
[sighs] There has to be another way.
We can't just give up.

40
00:02:44,789 --> 00:02:49,002
I can rescue them. I know the Fright Zone.
I'll find a way to get them back.

41
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:54,048
-How are you going to do that?
-I... I don't know yet.

42
00:02:54,132 --> 00:02:57,385
But I'll think of something, I promise.
I'll bring them home.

43
00:03:07,228 --> 00:03:08,646
[sobbing]

44
00:03:10,815 --> 00:03:11,733
Huh?

45
00:03:14,652 --> 00:03:16,404
What are you all doing here?

46
00:03:16,487 --> 00:03:20,116
We're the Princess Alliance.
And the Horde took one of our own.

47
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:24,662
-We're ready for our first mission.
-Let's go get our friends back.

48
00:03:25,121 --> 00:03:26,497
[alarm buzzes]

49
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:35,381
Dinner rations, prisoner.

50
00:03:38,426 --> 00:03:39,385
Ow!

51
00:03:40,845 --> 00:03:44,724
-Hey. What's your name?
-Me? You're talking to me?

52
00:03:44,807 --> 00:03:46,559
Sure. Is that all right?

53
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:50,313
Uh, I guess, but no one ever talks to me.

54
00:03:50,396 --> 00:03:51,231
I'm Kyle.

55
00:03:51,314 --> 00:03:54,776
Hey, Kyle. I'm Bow.
Can you do me a favor?

56
00:03:54,859 --> 00:03:57,028
Can you tell me
where they're holding the princess?

57
00:03:57,111 --> 00:03:59,113
-Princess?
-She's my best friend.

58
00:03:59,197 --> 00:04:02,492
No one will let me talk to her
or even tell me if she's okay.

59
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:07,121
Ah, I'm sure she's fine. Maybe.
Or she's not. I don't know.

60
00:04:07,205 --> 00:04:08,456
Do you know where she is?

61
00:04:08,539 --> 00:04:11,084
No, that kind of information
is classified.

62
00:04:11,167 --> 00:04:14,003
-They wouldn't tell me.
-Help me get a message to her.

63
00:04:14,462 --> 00:04:16,214
Uh, uh...

64
00:04:16,422 --> 00:04:18,508
-I better be leaving now.
-No, wait.

65
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:20,343
-I like your shirt.
-Kyle!

66
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:29,060
[Adora] Okay. This is the Horde prison.
Glimmer and Bow are being held inside.

67
00:04:29,143 --> 00:04:32,647
Entrapta, this perfume bottle is you.
Perfuma, you're nail polish.

68
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:34,232
Mermista, lipstick.

69
00:04:34,315 --> 00:04:36,651
Ew, do you know
what that stuff is made of?

70
00:04:36,734 --> 00:04:37,568
I'll be this knife.

71
00:04:38,444 --> 00:04:40,655
I feel like Perfuma should be
the perfume bottle.

72
00:04:40,738 --> 00:04:42,907
That makes the most logical sense.

73
00:04:42,991 --> 00:04:44,742
Maybe I could be a flower.

74
00:04:44,826 --> 00:04:46,995
Could I be this miniature
painted model of Bow?

75
00:04:47,078 --> 00:04:49,998
No. Those represent Bow and Glimmer.
And this one's mine.

76
00:04:52,417 --> 00:04:55,086
Bow made them for us.
Okay, just... Everyone, focus!

77
00:04:55,169 --> 00:04:58,006
Our entry point will be here,
near the Horde's scrapyard.

78
00:04:58,089 --> 00:05:00,466
<i>It's close to the prison</i>
<i>and lightly guarded.</i>

79
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:02,969
<i>Perfuma and Entrapta</i>
<i>will access the security tower</i>

80
00:05:03,052 --> 00:05:05,763
<i>and wait for my signal</i>
<i>to disable the lights.</i>

81
00:05:07,098 --> 00:05:09,892
<i>Mermista will access the Fright Zone's</i>
<i>sewer system.</i>

82
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:12,603
<i>She'll swim through the pipes</i>
<i>into the building and open the door.</i>

83
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:14,981
I'm sorry, Mermista will what?

84
00:05:15,732 --> 00:05:18,484
I know it sounds bad, but you're the one
who can breathe underwater.

85
00:05:19,444 --> 00:05:20,403
[groaning]

86
00:05:23,281 --> 00:05:25,033
Super gross.

87
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:28,411
[Adora] Sea Hawk and I
will take up position by the entrance.

88
00:05:28,494 --> 00:05:31,080
The two of us will neutralize
any guards on patrol,

89
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:33,374
Entrapta and Perfuma will regroup
on our position

90
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:36,127
and the team will enter
when Mermista opens the door.

91
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:38,921
Excellent plan. Adventure!

92
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:41,549
[groaning]

93
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:43,259
[rat squeaking]

94
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:44,802
Hmm?

95
00:05:45,553 --> 00:05:46,387
[sighs]

96
00:05:50,475 --> 00:05:51,851
[grumbles]

97
00:05:54,645 --> 00:05:55,646
[shrieking]

98
00:06:02,487 --> 00:06:04,572
Mermista should be in place by now.

99
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:14,499
Adora's signal.

100
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:17,251
Fright Zone log, day one.

101
00:06:17,335 --> 00:06:20,713
I can barely contain
my excitement! Ha-ha.

102
00:06:21,172 --> 00:06:23,758
Hmm. The Horde's using
an outdated wiring system.

103
00:06:24,133 --> 00:06:27,637
It really would work so much better
if I just consolidated these conduits

104
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,431
-and rerouted the current here...
-Entrapta?

105
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:33,601
Now would be a good time for those lights.

106
00:06:33,684 --> 00:06:34,769
Oh, right.

107
00:06:34,852 --> 00:06:35,853
[grunting]

108
00:06:36,104 --> 00:06:37,146
[alarm wailing]

109
00:06:37,438 --> 00:06:40,441
-[guard gasps] What happened?
-We go on three.

110
00:06:40,775 --> 00:06:42,026
Ready? One--

111
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:43,820
Forward!

112
00:06:47,615 --> 00:06:49,075
[grunting and shouting]

113
00:06:50,326 --> 00:06:51,869
I said on three.

114
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:53,371
I got excited.

115
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,420
-Where's Mermista?
-She must've gotten held up.

116
00:07:00,503 --> 00:07:02,380
Come on. We need to secure the guards.

117
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:07,885
Entrapta? Entrapta?

118
00:07:09,137 --> 00:07:10,763
[sighs]

119
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:12,765
[beeping and whirring nearby]

120
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:19,981
The subject appears to be harvesting
scrap components, possibly for reuse.

121
00:07:22,817 --> 00:07:24,986
-Fascinating.
-Entrapta.

122
00:07:25,069 --> 00:07:28,906
-We're supposed to meet the others.
-I know. I was waiting for you.

123
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:32,326
Huh. How very considerate. Let's go.

124
00:07:33,911 --> 00:07:35,163
Oh, ha.

125
00:07:35,246 --> 00:07:36,414
[groans]

126
00:07:36,497 --> 00:07:37,915
So we don't get separated.

127
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:41,085
[groans]

128
00:07:47,592 --> 00:07:48,426
Psst.

129
00:07:54,932 --> 00:07:56,517
Halt. Who are you?

130
00:07:57,602 --> 00:08:01,063
Me? I'm the inspector.

131
00:08:01,355 --> 00:08:05,943
I'm here to inspect all the things.

132
00:08:06,027 --> 00:08:07,528
Inspector?

133
00:08:17,371 --> 00:08:20,124
Inspector! Oh, of course.

134
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:22,293
I must have forgotten you were coming.

135
00:08:22,376 --> 00:08:25,296
We're long overdue for an inspection,
I do have to admit it,

136
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:28,299
but I can assure you we are up to code.

137
00:08:32,303 --> 00:08:35,723
Wha...? How did this happen?
We had a plan.

138
00:08:35,806 --> 00:08:38,392
Actually, you kind of lost me
at that perfume bottle.

139
00:08:38,476 --> 00:08:40,061
Where have you two been?

140
00:08:40,144 --> 00:08:43,147
I tried to get here sooner,
but harmonious teamwork

141
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:46,192
with Entrapta can be a challenge.

142
00:08:46,651 --> 00:08:48,694
This isn't a game. It's the Horde.

143
00:08:48,778 --> 00:08:52,406
Glimmer and Bow are being held captive
in this building and now Sea Hawk is gone.

144
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:55,326
Okay. All right, everyone calm down.

145
00:08:55,409 --> 00:08:58,287
Maybe we could try
a simple breathing exercise.

146
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:00,665
[chuckles] Deep calming breaths. Hmm.

147
00:09:01,249 --> 00:09:02,667
[alarm wailing]

148
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,919
Come on. We're going in.

149
00:09:09,298 --> 00:09:10,466
Could you not?

150
00:09:10,841 --> 00:09:12,468
Huh? What happened to you?

151
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:15,471
Uh, the sewer happened to me.

152
00:09:15,763 --> 00:09:18,933
We can't waste any more time.
Bow and Glimmer need us.

153
00:09:19,016 --> 00:09:21,477
-Can I get a thank you?
-Thank you.

154
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:22,395
[shouts]

155
00:09:24,438 --> 00:09:25,773
[chattering nearby]

156
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:31,279
We need to get to an information port.

157
00:09:31,362 --> 00:09:33,531
I'll hack into the database
and identify the cell block

158
00:09:33,614 --> 00:09:35,283
Glimmer and Bow are being held in.

159
00:09:35,366 --> 00:09:37,868
Hey, where's the geeky princess?

160
00:09:38,786 --> 00:09:43,291
[chuckles nervously] Okay, she is really
putting a crimp in my harmony!

161
00:09:43,374 --> 00:09:44,250
Don't worry.

162
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:47,712
We'll find Entrapta and Sea Hawk,
and we'll recue Glimmer and Bow.

163
00:09:47,795 --> 00:09:50,172
I don't know. That sounds like a lot.

164
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:54,552
But you know me,
I'm totally up for anything.

165
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:59,807
Fright Zone Log, day one continued.
Keypads appear in every corridor

166
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:03,144
and are capable of giving status updates
on multiple systems.

167
00:10:03,227 --> 00:10:05,104
Wow. Hello there, little guy.

168
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:08,357

169
00:10:12,153 --> 00:10:14,947

00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:29,462
[yelling]

173
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:31,547
I should warn you, Princess.

174
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:35,051
Any attempt to teleport
through these restraints

175
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:36,552
will only cause you pain.

176
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:37,470
[groans]

177
00:10:37,553 --> 00:10:42,141
It seems my Black Garnet
and your powers don't mix.

178
00:10:42,224 --> 00:10:45,394
Besides, your mother will be here soon.

179
00:10:45,728 --> 00:10:49,065
I know all about you and your mind games,
Shadow Weaver.

180
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:53,319
Adora told me, so, save it.
And, by the way, she's not a fan.

181
00:10:53,402 --> 00:10:57,740
[Shadow Weaver] I'm not playing games.
What I said about Queen Angella is true.

182
00:10:57,823 --> 00:11:02,995
She's coming to surrender herself
in exchange for your safety.

183
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:07,583
Oh. It's a shame, the toll this Rebellion
has taken on your family.

184
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:10,586
First, you lose your father and now...

185
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:12,755
She-Ra will stop you.

186
00:11:12,838 --> 00:11:14,924
There is no She-Ra.

187
00:11:15,549 --> 00:11:17,843
We have the sword.

188
00:11:17,927 --> 00:11:22,098
Not Adora. There will be no one left
to stop the Horde.

189
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:25,851
In a few hours, Bright Moon will fall

190
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:29,313
and Etheria will be ours to rule.

191
00:11:30,231 --> 00:11:31,440
[grunting]

192
00:11:33,442 --> 00:11:35,027
[yelling]

193
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:40,032
Ooh. Tsk, tsk. Careful now.

194
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:45,413
It would be a shame if we had no princess
to exchange for the queen.

195
00:11:45,621 --> 00:11:46,997
[Glimmer groans]

196
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:53,212
Well, you Horde types run a tight ship,
I must say.

197
00:11:53,838 --> 00:11:56,549
Everything seems to be up to code.

198
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:03,848
Yes, indeed, entirely up to code.
You pass with flying colors.

199
00:12:04,181 --> 00:12:06,726
Now, unless you have something else
for me to inspect,

200
00:12:06,809 --> 00:12:09,270
I should get home
to my inspector children.

201
00:12:09,353 --> 00:12:11,605
-You know, you look familiar.
-[gulps]

202
00:12:12,106 --> 00:12:15,484
Perhaps you've seen me in your dreams?

203
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:19,780
No, that's not it. Princess Prom.
That's where I know you from.

204
00:12:19,864 --> 00:12:22,658
I knew it would come to me.
You were there with that mermaid.

205
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:26,454
She has a name!
I mean, no, that wasn't me.

206
00:12:26,537 --> 00:12:28,372
You're with the Rebellion.

207
00:12:28,789 --> 00:12:32,877
Now, as a scrupulous inspector,
threats... [clears throat]

208
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,754
normally wouldn't work on me.

209
00:12:34,837 --> 00:12:39,216
But in this case, uh,
perhaps we can reach a compromise?

210
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:41,302
"Duck"?

211
00:12:41,385 --> 00:12:42,470
Ooh, where?

212
00:12:43,053 --> 00:12:45,389
-Oh! Duck.
-[Scorpia screams]

213
00:12:46,223 --> 00:12:47,475
Hi.

214
00:12:48,809 --> 00:12:51,479
Oh! That was a top-notch rescue.

215
00:12:51,979 --> 00:12:54,565
To be honest, I wasn't sure
which one I was gonna hit.

216
00:12:54,982 --> 00:12:59,028
Okay, I found Bow's cell,
but I can't find Glimmer anywhere.

217
00:12:59,111 --> 00:13:02,615
They must be holding her somewhere else.
This isn't good. [gasps]

218
00:13:04,867 --> 00:13:08,245
-What should we do?
-I am not going back in the sewer.

219
00:13:09,246 --> 00:13:12,333
It's okay. This is my new friend, Emily.

220
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:14,251
I reprogrammed her.

221
00:13:15,044 --> 00:13:16,420
Where have you been?

222
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:19,757
-Where have you been?
-It doesn't matter.

223
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:22,009
We're all together. Let's finish this.

224
00:13:25,179 --> 00:13:27,598
Bow's cell is in section B, level 20.

225
00:13:27,681 --> 00:13:30,142
We'll get him out first
and then figure out where Glimmer is.

226
00:13:30,226 --> 00:13:31,811
Entrapta, can you get us up there?

227
00:13:31,894 --> 00:13:36,524
Yes, I can. I mean, maybe.
I don't know. I'm definitely gonna try.

228
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:38,651
[laughing]

229
00:13:38,734 --> 00:13:40,778
This is gonna be fun.

230
00:13:43,572 --> 00:13:45,449
Okay. Sea Hawk, Perfuma, you're with me.

231
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:48,327
I'll keep an eye on this one,
in case she tries

232
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:49,995
to befriend any more robots.

233
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:51,914
On to the rescue!

234
00:13:52,206 --> 00:13:53,290
[grunting]

235
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:57,628
-[Kyle] Bow. Bow!
-Kyle?

236
00:13:58,003 --> 00:14:01,215
I'm supposed to be in the barracks.
Lonnie made me cover her latrine duty.

237
00:14:01,298 --> 00:14:03,884
-What's going on?
-I found out where your friend is.

238
00:14:03,968 --> 00:14:06,428
Shadow Weaver has her
in the Black Garnet chamber.

239
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:07,972
Oh. That sounds bad.

240
00:14:08,055 --> 00:14:11,642
Uh, yeah. It's pretty bad.
But she's alive, at least.

241
00:14:11,725 --> 00:14:14,979
Shadow Weaver is planning to ransom her
in exchange for the Queen.

242
00:14:15,062 --> 00:14:18,315
-Why are you telling me all this?
-I don't know.

243
00:14:18,607 --> 00:14:22,528
I guess, because you're the first person
who's ever listened to me.

244
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:27,408
I mean, I'm being held prisoner, so...

245
00:14:27,491 --> 00:14:30,244
I don't know that I have a choice,
but sure!

246
00:14:35,749 --> 00:14:36,750
[all shouting]

247
00:14:38,836 --> 00:14:39,795
[gasps]

248
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:42,047
Whoops! That's not right.

249
00:14:43,465 --> 00:14:45,050
[grunting]

250
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:46,635
[grumbles]

251
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:50,806
Entrapta.

252
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:51,891
[shouting]

253
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:54,018
[all shout]

254
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:55,686
Perfuma.

255
00:14:57,021 --> 00:14:58,063
Hmm? [grunts]

256
00:14:59,064 --> 00:14:59,899
Hang on.

257
00:15:00,983 --> 00:15:03,819
You think you can just come back here?

258
00:15:04,486 --> 00:15:05,738
[grunting and shouting]

259
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:10,326
-I need to save my friends.
-We were your friends.

260
00:15:20,127 --> 00:15:21,211
[roars]

261
00:15:21,295 --> 00:15:23,380
[Entrapta laughs, Mermista screams]

262
00:15:23,464 --> 00:15:24,757
[grunting]

263
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,300
-[alarm buzzes]
-[Sea Hawk grunts]

264
00:15:28,052 --> 00:15:29,970
[all shouting and grunting]

265
00:15:36,894 --> 00:15:38,145
[grumbles]

266
00:15:39,396 --> 00:15:42,024
-Adora, are you all right?
-Thanks to you.

267
00:15:42,107 --> 00:15:43,817
Great hit, Perfuma.

268
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:48,656
No one's ever asked for my help before.

269
00:15:48,739 --> 00:15:50,574
People don't think
I can do anything right.

270
00:15:50,658 --> 00:15:54,078
-Mm-hmm. That seems tough.
-[thudding and clanging]

271
00:15:54,745 --> 00:15:56,872
Why am I telling you this?
I shouldn't be here.

272
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:59,291
I'm gonna get in so much trouble
if I get caught.

273
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:03,295
No, wait. Um... I mean,
we're just talking. [chuckles]

274
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:05,339
How much trouble could you get in
for talking?

275
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:09,510
Oh! You'd be surprised. I get in trouble
for everything around here.

276
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:12,346
Uh, that doesn't seem fair.

277
00:16:12,429 --> 00:16:14,598
I know! But then I thought
how brave you are

278
00:16:14,682 --> 00:16:16,016
for wanting to save your friend.

279
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:19,019
And maybe, if I helped you,
I could be your friend too.

280
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:22,314
Uh, friends, sure, definitely.

281
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:24,900
We can be friends. [chuckles]

282
00:16:28,696 --> 00:16:29,613
[grunting]

283
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:39,164
[roars]

284
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:41,917
[shouts]

285
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:44,503
Good team, geek Princess.

286
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:50,300
-Goodbye. Bow!
-[Kyle yelling]

287
00:16:50,384 --> 00:16:52,720
[laughs] We're here to save you.

288
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:57,975
-Adora.
-Bow. Bow, where's Glimmer?

289
00:16:58,058 --> 00:17:00,894
Shadow Weaver has her
in the Black Garnet chamber.

290
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:05,315
-Adora, what are we gonna do?
-[alarm wailing]

291
00:17:05,399 --> 00:17:06,567
Come on.

292
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:11,905
[soldiers shouting nearby]

293
00:17:22,207 --> 00:17:25,377
-Can you get it open?
-I just need a little more time.

294
00:17:25,461 --> 00:17:26,712
[soldiers shouting]

295
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:29,548
[Entrapta laughing]

296
00:17:29,631 --> 00:17:32,468
This vent system leads
to where you can steal a skiff.

297
00:17:32,843 --> 00:17:36,138
Each chamber needs to be sealed
and purged before you can move on.

298
00:17:36,221 --> 00:17:39,475
The doors will only stay open
for a few seconds, so keep up the pace.

299
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:44,646
-Adora, what are you doing?
-Don't worry about me.

300
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:48,150
I'm gonna buy you some time
and find Glimmer. Meet you there, okay?

301
00:17:48,817 --> 00:17:49,651
Adora!

302
00:17:51,153 --> 00:17:52,571
Adora!

303
00:17:55,991 --> 00:17:57,242
[Bow grunts]

304
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:07,753
I surrender. Take me to see Shadow Weaver.

305
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:13,175
[gasps] Glimmer. I'm here.

306
00:18:13,258 --> 00:18:15,928
Don't worry, everything will be okay.
I'll save you.

307
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:21,934
-What have you done to her?
-[Shadow Weaver] Leave us.

308
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:25,854
Report to the Force Captain barracks
and pack your things.

309
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:29,024
Now that Adora is back,
there's no need for you there.

310
00:18:29,358 --> 00:18:30,192
Seriously?

311
00:18:30,275 --> 00:18:34,196
After everything I've done for you,
it's still her you want?

312
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:35,739
I said, go!

313
00:18:44,832 --> 00:18:47,417
Shadow Weaver,
I'll stay here with you willingly,

314
00:18:47,501 --> 00:18:49,711
but you have to let Glimmer go first.

315
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:53,257
-Adora, no.
-Glimmer, are you okay?

316
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:54,633
You are correct, Adora.

317
00:18:54,716 --> 00:18:57,052
You shall stay willingly,

318
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:59,721
because I am going to wipe your mind.

319
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:02,307
You'll have no memory of She-Ra

320
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:04,476
or the time you spent with the Rebellion.

321
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:07,771
Everything will be as it once was.

322
00:19:08,063 --> 00:19:10,566
As for the princess, once I'm done,

323
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:13,443
you'll be happy to have her
as your prisoner.

324
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:16,822
-No. Adora!
-[Adora shouting]

325
00:19:23,495 --> 00:19:25,664
We need to go back for Glimmer and Adora.

326
00:19:25,747 --> 00:19:27,416
We need to do what Adora said.

327
00:19:27,499 --> 00:19:29,793
They'll make it out
and we'll be ready with the skiff.

328
00:19:29,877 --> 00:19:32,087
No princess will be left behind.

329
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:34,923
[Adora groaning]

330
00:19:38,385 --> 00:19:39,344
[screaming]

331
00:19:41,346 --> 00:19:42,848
[grunting and shouting]

332
00:19:55,444 --> 00:19:56,278
[shouts]

333
00:19:58,822 --> 00:20:00,157
[Shadow Weaver groans]

334
00:20:00,657 --> 00:20:02,159
[panting]

335
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:05,037
Adora? Are you okay?

336
00:20:05,954 --> 00:20:07,039
Do you know who I am?

337
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:08,749
[groans]

338
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:10,042
Glimmer.

339
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:11,585
[chuckles]

340
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:19,384
We made it. This way, to the vehicle bay.

341
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:24,056
[Emily beeping]

342
00:20:24,139 --> 00:20:26,225
-Wait. Emily.
-Entrapta.

343
00:20:26,308 --> 00:20:27,392
No!

344
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:34,483
[alarm wailing]

345
00:20:38,987 --> 00:20:40,656
[groaning]

346
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:45,452
-Glimmer, what's happening?
-I don't know.

347
00:20:45,535 --> 00:20:47,788
-I can't teleport.
-What?

348
00:20:58,090 --> 00:20:59,258
Catra.

349
00:21:10,644 --> 00:21:13,272
-What are you doing?
-Take it.

350
00:21:15,607 --> 00:21:17,734
This is not because I like you.

351
00:21:22,489 --> 00:21:24,908
-Catra.
-Just get out of here.

352
00:21:26,785 --> 00:21:29,538
[Adora] For the honor of Grayskull.

353
00:21:31,498 --> 00:21:32,582
[grunts]

354
00:21:43,427 --> 00:21:44,594
There they are.

355
00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:49,975
[grunting]

356
00:21:59,067 --> 00:22:00,402
[Glimmer laughing]

357
00:22:00,986 --> 00:22:02,154
Glimmer.

358
00:22:05,032 --> 00:22:06,575
Wait, where's Entrapta?

359
00:22:09,786 --> 00:22:11,538
Entrapta didn't make it.

360
00:22:14,458 --> 00:22:15,334
What do you mean?

361
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,130
She's gone.

362
00:22:25,302 --> 00:22:28,680
-Then, we have to go back for her.
-No, she's--

363
00:22:29,014 --> 00:22:30,432
She's really gone.

364
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:35,562
[sobs]
