00:00:28,445 --> 00:00:30,155
{\an8}It's coming from the Fright Zone.

2
00:00:30,238 --> 00:00:32,782
{\an8}Whatever's happening,
the Horde is causing it.

3
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:37,037
{\an8}The Whispering Woods
are freezing over. What do we do?

4
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,289
{\an8}[grunts] We have to get home.

5
00:00:39,372 --> 00:00:41,791
{\an8}We have to make sure
everyone at Bright Moon is okay.

[Scorpia] Catra, you gotta see this.

16
00:01:26,961 --> 00:01:30,799
Tidal waves, firestorms, earthquakes.

17
00:01:30,882 --> 00:01:33,510
Man, Etheria's really taking this hard.

18
00:01:33,593 --> 00:01:36,554
I mean, yay for us. But also, whoa.

19
00:01:36,638 --> 00:01:39,432
The experiment has been more effective
than I could ever have dreamed.

20
00:01:39,516 --> 00:01:41,017
This proves my hypothesis correct!

21
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:43,770
With the Black Garnet
at 200 percent power,

22
00:01:43,853 --> 00:01:46,773
the precarious equilibrium that governs
all of Etheria's nature functions

23
00:01:46,856 --> 00:01:48,441
has been thrown into complete chaos,

24
00:01:48,525 --> 00:01:51,027
no doubt, as a result
of the other elemental Runestones--

25
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:53,363
-Ah! Hey.
-Translate.

26
00:01:54,697 --> 00:01:57,325
By making the Black Garnet more powerful,

27
00:01:57,408 --> 00:02:00,703
we've sapped power
from the other Princesses' Runestones,

28
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:03,832
upsetting the balance
and making the weather go screw-y.

29
00:02:03,915 --> 00:02:05,416
It's in my notes, if you'd like--

30
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:07,418
Whoa, whoa.
What was that you just said

31
00:02:07,502 --> 00:02:09,838
about making the other princesses
less powerful?

32
00:02:09,921 --> 00:02:12,841
Well, the other Elemental Princesses,
that is.

33
00:02:12,924 --> 00:02:16,261
Don't worry about me and Scorpia.
I don't have a Runestone,

34
00:02:16,344 --> 00:02:19,264
and Scorpia doesn't have any connection
to the Black Garnet anymore--

35
00:02:19,347 --> 00:02:21,933
-If she ever did.
-Huh? Somebody say my name?

36
00:02:22,308 --> 00:02:26,146
And how would we make
an effect like that permanent?

37
00:02:26,229 --> 00:02:29,774
Well, I'd have to run more tests
to know for sure, but...

38
00:02:30,358 --> 00:02:31,401
Oh.

39
00:02:34,445 --> 00:02:36,990
-Yeah, that should work too.
-Get a strike team together.

40
00:02:37,073 --> 00:02:39,576
-We're going to Bright Moon.
-Bright Moon? Why?

41
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:42,871
Because we're going to take out
Bright Moon's Runestone.

42
00:02:43,246 --> 00:02:47,625
And with the Whispering Woods frozen over,
there's nothing stopping us.

43
00:02:57,135 --> 00:02:58,511
Hmm.

44
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:02,473
[grunts]

45
00:03:04,976 --> 00:03:06,436
[all shouting]

46
00:03:10,064 --> 00:03:11,399
-Look.
-[Glimmer gasps]

47
00:03:12,275 --> 00:03:13,818
[Glimmer] That's Bright Moon.

48
00:03:14,485 --> 00:03:16,738
-It's the distress beacon.
-Hang on.

49
00:03:21,242 --> 00:03:25,163
-Mom. What's going on?
-The elements are out of harmony.

50
00:03:25,246 --> 00:03:28,750
The Moonstone is using all its power
to counteract the cloud of darkness.

51
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:30,960
But it's not enough.

52
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:34,172
It's taking nearly all my strength
just to keep my connection with it.

53
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:37,008
That cloud is coming from the Fright Zone.

54
00:03:37,091 --> 00:03:39,969
So what's our plan?
We do have a plan, right?

55
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:41,721
Guys?

56
00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:50,355
The woods are frozen over.

57
00:03:50,438 --> 00:03:53,274
There's nothing left
to shield Bright Moon from the Horde.

58
00:03:53,358 --> 00:03:55,693
We have to prepare for an attack.

59
00:03:56,194 --> 00:03:59,864
[Bow] Our scouts reported sighting
the entire Horde army in the woods,

60
00:03:59,948 --> 00:04:01,950
moving towards us at top speed.

61
00:04:02,033 --> 00:04:04,744
We must protect Bright Moon at all costs.

62
00:04:04,827 --> 00:04:06,454
If the Moonstone is destroyed,

63
00:04:06,537 --> 00:04:08,831
there will be nothing left
to stop the darkness.

64
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:12,335
Someone must have seen the beacon.
Why hasn't anyone come?

65
00:04:12,418 --> 00:04:13,795
The Alliance is broken,

66
00:04:13,878 --> 00:04:16,589
and other princesses
have their own kingdoms to protect.

67
00:04:17,048 --> 00:04:19,217
-No one's coming, Bow.
-Someone's come!

68
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:20,426
Is it the princesses?

69
00:04:22,136 --> 00:04:22,971
Oh.

70
00:04:23,763 --> 00:04:28,017
Spinnerella and Netossa. [chuckles]
Thanks for coming, guys.

71
00:04:28,518 --> 00:04:30,770
You still don't know what we do, do you?

72
00:04:31,813 --> 00:04:33,189
Uh... No.

73
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:34,482
Seriously?

74
00:04:34,565 --> 00:04:37,026
It's in the name. Net-tossa.

75
00:04:38,027 --> 00:04:40,321
Nets. I toss nets, okay?

76
00:04:40,405 --> 00:04:42,865
Yes, darling, you have beautiful nets.

77
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:45,868
At least you have powers,
which is more than I've got.

78
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:48,871
But it doesn't matter.
I don't need magic to fight.

79
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:51,541
Glimmer, not only are you
without your powers,

80
00:04:51,624 --> 00:04:54,127
but you're still glitching.
It's dangerous.

81
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:56,379
-But mom...
-[Adora] Your mom is right.

82
00:04:56,462 --> 00:05:00,133
I don't want you risking yourselves.
She-Ra can do this alone.

83
00:05:00,216 --> 00:05:01,718
This is what she's for.

84
00:05:01,801 --> 00:05:06,055
Adora, not even She-Ra can take out
an army of Horde soldiers on her own.

85
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:07,348
Then what good is she?

86
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:22,864
Adora, are you okay?

87
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:27,410
Catra will be leading the Horde
when they attack. I have to face her.

88
00:05:27,493 --> 00:05:29,370
I can't let her hurt anyone else.

89
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:32,123
What happened to you
in that First Ones temple?

90
00:05:32,206 --> 00:05:35,543
I saw Catra in there.
I thought I could get through to her,

91
00:05:35,626 --> 00:05:38,296
but all I did was push her farther
to the side of evil.

92
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:41,174
Light Hope said
that I'd endanger my friends

93
00:05:41,257 --> 00:05:43,426
by coming back, and she was right.

94
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:46,554
Everything that's happening now
is my fault.

95
00:05:46,637 --> 00:05:47,889
You got this.

96
00:05:48,806 --> 00:05:50,350
And we got your back.

97
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:54,437
Now, come on. The Horde will be here soon.

98
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:55,730
We have to be ready.

99
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:00,276
Welcome to the Bright Moon armory!

100
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:03,738
Well, not really, but I've been
stashing weapons in here for months.

101
00:06:03,821 --> 00:06:06,199
[gasps] Dibs on arrows. [laughing]

102
00:06:06,282 --> 00:06:07,116

103
00:06:10,495 --> 00:06:11,371

[grunts]

105
00:06:14,415 --> 00:06:15,249
Hmm?

106
00:06:18,586 --> 00:06:20,671
-Uh, no.
-[groans]

107
00:06:21,756 --> 00:06:22,840
[Angella] Glimmer?

108
00:06:23,925 --> 00:06:26,803
Mom! How did you know
we'd be in here?

109
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:29,722
Did you really think I wouldn't notice
you hoarding weapons?

110
00:06:30,181 --> 00:06:31,224
I'm sorry, Mom.

111
00:06:31,307 --> 00:06:34,602
I can't just stand by while my friends
and my home are in danger.

112
00:06:34,685 --> 00:06:35,895
I have to do this.

113
00:06:36,437 --> 00:06:38,856
-I know.
-Mom, I... Wait, what?

114
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:41,025
I've been trying all these years
to mold you

115
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:42,735
into someone more like me.

116
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:48,408
But you're too stubborn and hotheaded,
and brave, like your father.

117
00:06:51,202 --> 00:06:55,206
This was your father's staff.
I think it's time it's time you had it.

118
00:07:01,504 --> 00:07:03,256
[loud crash, all grunting]

119
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:04,966
They're here.

120
00:07:06,217 --> 00:07:09,095
For the honor of Grayskull!

121
00:07:55,516 --> 00:07:57,185
We got this, right?

122
00:07:57,518 --> 00:07:59,395
Yeah. Definitely.

123
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:02,482
They're gonna be sorry they ever tried
to mess with Bright Moon.

124
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:10,323
Defend the castle. [grunts]

125

[grunts]

132
00:08:49,445 --> 00:08:51,489
-She-Ra needs our help.
-Go to her.

133
00:08:51,572 --> 00:08:55,826
I'll keep the Moonstone lit
and the darkness away as long as I can.

134
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:57,245
You heard the queen.

135
00:08:59,413 --> 00:09:00,998
For the Rebellion!

136
00:09:08,631 --> 00:09:09,465

-Yeah!

[panting]

145
00:10:25,249 --> 00:10:26,292
Hey, Adora.

146
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:29,795
Catra. Surprised to see me?

147
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:32,715
Not really. It wouldn't be that easy
to get rid of you.

148
00:10:32,798 --> 00:10:34,258
[yells]

149
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:41,766
You know, I'm actually glad
you did made it out of there alive.

150
00:10:42,266 --> 00:10:46,437
Because now, I can take you out myself.

154
00:10:59,116 --> 00:11:00,701
Isn't that nice?

155
00:11:01,786 --> 00:11:04,580
You've accessorized.
Not that it's going to help you.

156
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:07,667
[Scorpia yells]

157
00:11:13,047 --> 00:11:15,049
Boom. Nets.

160
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:31,649
Tired already?

161
00:11:31,732 --> 00:11:34,485
Punching was supposed to be
the one thing you're good at.

162
00:11:34,568 --> 00:11:35,403
[groans]

163
00:11:35,736 --> 00:11:38,030
And I thought you
were supposed to be quicker.

164
00:11:38,656 --> 00:11:40,282
[grunting and shouting]

165
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:55,214
Give it up, Catra.

166
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:58,175
There's no way you win this.

167
00:11:58,801 --> 00:12:01,220
I already made it a lot farther
than anyone thought.

168
00:12:07,852 --> 00:12:10,938
You, on the other hand,
you're not looking so good.

[Catra laughing]

170
00:12:20,865 --> 00:12:24,201

[shouts]

172
00:12:27,121 --> 00:12:31,542
It won't be over until Bright Moon
is destroyed and the Rebellion falls.

173
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:35,421
It won't be over
until darkness covers Etheria forever.

174
00:12:35,504 --> 00:12:39,633
And it won't be over until I see
the looks on your friends' faces

175
00:12:39,717 --> 00:12:42,136
when they find out that you failed,

176
00:12:42,219 --> 00:12:45,014
that you were too weak to save them.

177
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:46,682
[yelling]

178
00:12:58,027 --> 00:13:00,571
Enough! You've lost, Catra.

179
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:02,948
You sure about that?

180
00:13:03,699 --> 00:13:04,533
[gasps]

181
00:13:13,876 --> 00:13:15,377
[shouting]

182
00:13:16,378 --> 00:13:19,965
What? Did you really think
this was about you?

183
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:25,721
That Runestone is your last defense,
isn't it?

184
00:13:26,388 --> 00:13:27,765
[laughing]

185
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:29,308
Have fun.

186
00:13:29,391 --> 00:13:30,684
[grunting]

187
00:13:32,394 --> 00:13:33,646
[panting]

188
00:13:33,729 --> 00:13:34,980
No!

189
00:13:36,565 --> 00:13:38,234
[yelling]

190
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:48,410
[grunting]

191
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:57,044
So, where were we? Oh, yeah.

192
00:13:57,127 --> 00:13:59,380
I was about to punch you.

193
00:14:06,637 --> 00:14:07,638
Where's my shield?

194
00:14:11,809 --> 00:14:13,310
[screaming]

195
00:14:21,235 --> 00:14:22,403
[panting]

196
00:14:25,322 --> 00:14:26,448
Uh-oh.

197
00:14:27,074 --> 00:14:28,492
[She-Ra groaning]

198
00:14:41,505 --> 00:14:43,465
[grunting]

199
00:15:00,232 --> 00:15:01,400
[gasps]

200
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:03,652
[shouting]

201
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:04,904
Ah. Pretty.

202
00:15:11,118 --> 00:15:12,286
[grunting]

203
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:19,835
Now, it's over.

204
00:15:37,102 --> 00:15:38,354
Come on.

205
00:15:39,188 --> 00:15:40,064
Hyah!

206
00:15:43,817 --> 00:15:44,735
[gasps]

207
00:15:46,487 --> 00:15:47,613
[yelling]

208
00:15:52,493 --> 00:15:54,203
-Mom.
-Princess.

209
00:16:01,585 --> 00:16:02,628
Huh? [shouts]

210
00:16:06,006 --> 00:16:07,967
Adora? Adora.

211
00:16:11,095 --> 00:16:13,806
Come on, don't give up yet, please.

212
00:16:14,181 --> 00:16:16,642
We can still fix this, right?

213
00:16:18,185 --> 00:16:20,104
Please, tell me we can fix this.

214
00:16:29,947 --> 00:16:31,031
I...

215
00:16:31,448 --> 00:16:32,616
I'm sorry.

216
00:16:33,867 --> 00:16:34,868
It's okay.

217
00:16:50,217 --> 00:16:51,301
[shouts]

218
00:16:51,927 --> 00:16:53,929
Adventure!

219
00:16:54,263 --> 00:16:56,223
-[Mermista] Don't do that.
-Sorry.

220
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:07,651
Ta-da!

221
00:17:07,735 --> 00:17:11,155
-Mermista, Sea Hawk, you came.
-Yeah, sorry it took so long.

222
00:17:11,238 --> 00:17:13,657
The sea kind of sucked today.

223
00:17:14,408 --> 00:17:15,743
[coughing]

224
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:18,078
Come on, get up!

225
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:23,167
[grunting]

226
00:17:27,796 --> 00:17:30,424
I saw the distress beacon.
Are you all okay?

227
00:17:44,646 --> 00:17:45,481
Hmm.

228
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:50,986
Ha!

229
00:17:53,655 --> 00:17:54,698
[gasps]

230
00:17:59,536 --> 00:18:00,788
No!

231
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:03,624
Hmm?

232
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:16,970
I hope I'm not too late.

233
00:18:18,972 --> 00:18:21,016
No. You're right on time.

234
00:18:22,059 --> 00:18:23,060
[grumbles]

235
00:18:24,853 --> 00:18:26,063
For Etheria!

236
00:18:31,068 --> 00:18:32,152
[Angella] Glimmer?

237
00:18:33,487 --> 00:18:35,405
-Mom.
-[Angella chuckles]

238
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:38,408
[gasps]

00:18:59,555 --> 00:19:00,764

240
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:11,275
[laughing]

241
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:14,278
Go on, go get them.

242
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:19,908
-[shouts]
-[chuckles]

243
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:21,994
[neighing]

244
00:19:29,543 --> 00:19:30,544
Yes!

245
00:19:31,336 --> 00:19:34,715
-Glimmer, you're sparkling again!
-Yeah. What did I miss?

246
00:19:34,798 --> 00:19:38,719
The princesses are united.
This is how it's supposed to be.

247
00:19:38,802 --> 00:19:43,557
-What do you say? Ready to finish this?
-[chuckles] Thought you'd never ask.

248
00:19:43,974 --> 00:19:46,143
-We're in.
-Let's do this already.

249
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:47,895
[Sea Hawk] Battle cry!

250
00:19:51,315 --> 00:19:52,691
[yells]

251
00:19:56,778 --> 00:19:58,155
[grunting and shouting]

252
00:20:12,252 --> 00:20:13,253
[both laughing]

253
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:26,892
[shouts]

254
00:20:42,157 --> 00:20:43,075
[grumbles]

255
00:20:52,501 --> 00:20:53,502
[grunting]

256
00:20:59,174 --> 00:21:00,926
[all cheering]

257
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:04,346
Adventure!

258
00:21:05,305 --> 00:21:07,015
I've never seen nets like that.

259
00:21:10,435 --> 00:21:12,396
Adora, it's over.

260
00:21:12,479 --> 00:21:16,441
-Bright Moon is saved.
-And the princesses are finally united!

261
00:21:17,025 --> 00:21:17,943
We did it.

262
00:21:18,026 --> 00:21:21,655
That is how it's done in the sea.

263
00:21:22,197 --> 00:21:25,367
-Really good job.
-Good job, girls. Onto the next.

264
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:28,287
-Yeah! We did things together.
-Isn't this wonderful?

265
00:21:35,627 --> 00:21:36,545
[gasps]

266
00:21:36,628 --> 00:21:37,963
[both laughing]

267
00:21:41,341 --> 00:21:43,302
-[Adora shouts]
-[Bow chuckles]

268
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:46,471
Thank you.

269
00:21:58,358 --> 00:22:03,864
[Hordak] Force Captain,
it seems your experiment has failed.

270
00:22:04,197 --> 00:22:07,492
On the contrary,
the experiment was a huge success.

271
00:22:07,576 --> 00:22:12,289
I know more about First Ones tech
than ever. This is just the beginning.

272
00:22:12,372 --> 00:22:16,460
I got us closer to conquering Bright Moon
than anyone ever has.

273
00:22:16,543 --> 00:22:19,129
Not to mention the Whispering Woods
is still in ruins.

274
00:22:19,212 --> 00:22:22,049
Etheria is ours for the taking.

275
00:22:26,887 --> 00:22:29,681
Very well, Force Captain Catra.

276
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:33,560
You will have other chances
to prove your worth to me

277
00:22:33,643 --> 00:22:35,937
as my second-in-command.
