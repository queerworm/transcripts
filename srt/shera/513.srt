{\an8}Hey, Adora.

{\an8}Catra! You can't be here.
It's too dangerous.

Shadow Weaver?

8
00:00:57,265 --> 00:00:59,726
Get Adora to the Heart.
I'll take care of this thing.

[Adora] It's Prime's virus.
It's keeping me from becoming She-Ra.

114

What does that mean? Is the Failsafe
not going to work without her?

No. It'll work.

116

Get as far away from here as you can.
I have to do this next part on my own.

Ah. I can feel it.

135
00:12:22,032 --> 00:12:24,660
The Heart is mine!

136
00:12:24,743 --> 00:12:28,247
You can't do this!
The Heart's power is too unstable.

137
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:31,167
It will take you and the whole universe
with it!

138
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:33,586
I have had enough
of this chatty little rebel.

139
00:12:33,669 --> 00:12:35,171
Dispose of her now.

140
00:12:37,339 --> 00:12:39,884
My dominion was perfect.

141
00:12:40,551 --> 00:12:43,053
Everything was as it should be.

142
00:12:43,888 --> 00:12:46,891
And so it shall be again.

I am not your brother.

148
00:13:04,658 --> 00:13:08,162
You made me in your image,
but I am more than that.

149
00:13:08,537 --> 00:13:11,415
I gave myself a name,
I made a life of my own.

150
00:13:11,499 --> 00:13:12,374
I made...

151
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:14,668
a friend.

152
00:13:16,378 --> 00:13:22,092
I am Hordak, and I defy your will.

157
00:13:34,605 --> 00:13:36,565
[Horde Prime] Ah, little brother.

158
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:38,025
So, it's true.

159
00:13:38,108 --> 00:13:40,986
You have been thoroughly corrupted.

160
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:42,780
-So be it!
-No!

161
00:13:42,863 --> 00:13:45,032
[Horde Prime] You have forced my hand.

162
00:13:45,115 --> 00:13:47,076
I will unleash the Heart,

163
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:52,164
and so we shall die
in cleansing flame together!

00:13:52,248 --> 00:13:53,082

[crash]

169
00:14:14,812 --> 00:14:17,314
Rejoice, Etheria,

170
00:14:17,398 --> 00:14:21,735
for your end has finally come!

171
00:14:22,403 --> 00:14:25,573
You have chosen darkness,

172
00:14:25,656 --> 00:14:29,076
and so,
into darkness you shall be plunged.

173
00:14:29,577 --> 00:14:32,997
The world will end in fire.

174
00:14:34,415 --> 00:14:36,542
-Adora!
-The Failsafe.

175
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:37,793
It didn't work.

176
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:40,296
[Horde Prime] And when the ashes scatter,

177
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:41,964
at last

178
00:14:42,047 --> 00:14:47,469
there will be peace!

179
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:53,726
Adora. Adora, stay awake!

180
00:14:59,398 --> 00:15:00,608
I'm sorry.

181
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:05,237
Adora!

182
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:08,699
Adora!

183
00:15:12,536 --> 00:15:13,412
[gasps]

184
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:22,338
-[door opens]
-Just let me brush it!

185
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:24,131
-No!
-[Glimmer laughs]

186
00:15:24,214 --> 00:15:26,926
Don't let her touch me.
She's gonna torture me.

187
00:15:27,009 --> 00:15:29,637
Do you always have to be this dramatic?

188
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,055
[Bow] Come on, guys.

189
00:15:31,138 --> 00:15:34,058
If we're late to Scorpia's first ball,
she's gonna kill us.

190
00:15:34,308 --> 00:15:36,310
Fine! You're off the hook.

191
00:15:36,685 --> 00:15:37,686
This time.

192
00:15:46,862 --> 00:15:47,738
You coming?

193
00:15:58,082 --> 00:15:59,833
A beautiful wish.

194
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:02,419
But there will be no future.

195
00:16:03,003 --> 00:16:04,380
Not for you.

196
00:16:05,756 --> 00:16:07,549
[screams]

197
00:16:14,848 --> 00:16:19,144
Adora! Please! You have to wake up!

198
00:16:20,604 --> 00:16:21,855
You can't give up.

199
00:16:21,939 --> 00:16:24,775
You have never given up
on anything in your life.

200
00:16:25,401 --> 00:16:26,652
Not even on me.

201
00:16:27,236 --> 00:16:29,947
So, don't you dare start now!

202
00:16:34,785 --> 00:16:36,120
It's too late.

203
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:37,788
I've failed.

204
00:16:37,871 --> 00:16:39,039
No! No!

205
00:16:39,415 --> 00:16:41,834
I've got you. I'm not letting go.

206
00:16:43,293 --> 00:16:46,213
Don't you get it? I love you.

207
00:16:46,296 --> 00:16:47,923
I always have.

208
00:16:48,257 --> 00:16:50,384
So, please, just this once...

209
00:16:51,218 --> 00:16:52,302
stay.

210
00:16:57,558 --> 00:16:58,600
Stay.

211
00:17:14,658 --> 00:17:15,826
You love me?

212
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:18,162
You're such an idiot.

213
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:23,333
I love you, too.

214
00:17:42,478 --> 00:17:44,313
Cry, Etheria!

215
00:17:44,396 --> 00:17:47,149
Cry for Prime's mercy!

216
00:17:47,232 --> 00:17:50,235
There will be no comfort for you!

217
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:55,741
All the universe will be consumed
in undying flame!

218
00:18:01,205 --> 00:18:02,247
[both gasp]

219
00:18:07,461 --> 00:18:08,504
[grunts]

220
00:18:10,464 --> 00:18:11,673
[growls]

221
00:18:15,594 --> 00:18:16,428
[gasps]

222
00:18:47,751 --> 00:18:49,128
[yells]

223
00:19:18,615 --> 00:19:19,616
[grunting]

224
00:19:27,457 --> 00:19:28,292
[growls]

225
00:19:34,798 --> 00:19:38,969
Though all is reduced to rubble,
Prime shall rise again.

226
00:19:39,052 --> 00:19:42,931
So it has been, and so it always shall be.

227
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:43,849
No.

228
00:19:44,224 --> 00:19:45,100
You're wrong.

229
00:19:45,475 --> 00:19:47,269
It's time for you to go.

230
00:19:47,352 --> 00:19:48,979
[gasping]

231
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:58,530
[gasping]

232
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:01,783
[screaming]

233
00:20:16,924 --> 00:20:18,717
[gasping]

234
00:20:21,511 --> 00:20:23,472
[Hordak] I remember you.

235
00:20:28,518 --> 00:20:30,062
Hordak!

236
00:20:31,104 --> 00:20:34,608
I'm so glad you're back!
Oh, we have so much to talk about!

237
00:20:36,276 --> 00:20:37,110
Glimmer?

238
00:20:37,986 --> 00:20:38,946
Hi, Dad.

239
00:20:39,947 --> 00:20:41,490
I... You...

240
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:43,450
Hello. I'm your dad!

241
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:45,118
Dad!

242
00:20:45,452 --> 00:20:46,578
[Spinerella laughs]

243
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:48,288
[neighs]

244
00:20:48,372 --> 00:20:50,040
[all laughing]

245
00:20:50,123 --> 00:20:53,502
Perfuma! Hi. Wow, you look...
You look great.

246
00:20:55,921 --> 00:20:57,047
Hey, Scorpia.

247
00:20:58,257 --> 00:20:59,383
Look, I...

248
00:20:59,466 --> 00:21:00,634
Ohh. There it is.

249
00:21:00,717 --> 00:21:01,927
You know I'm a hugger.

250
00:21:02,469 --> 00:21:04,137
Princess hug!

251
00:21:04,221 --> 00:21:05,472
[all laughing]

252
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:09,184
[Entrapta] I'm so glad you're here! Oh...

253
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:11,937
So, are we all just, like, okay with this?

254
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:15,190
[Bow] Look at us now. From capturing you
to us now being buddies.

255
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:17,276
-[Catra] We did it!
-[Bow] This is so dope!

256
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:47,264
Ah. You would be proud, Mara dearie.

257
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:51,059
[Catra] Adora?

258
00:21:57,774 --> 00:21:58,817
It's over.

259
00:21:59,651 --> 00:22:00,736
He's gone.

260
00:22:01,528 --> 00:22:02,612
Good riddance.

261
00:22:07,659 --> 00:22:08,827
-[both yelling]
-Whoa!

262
00:22:14,499 --> 00:22:16,585
So, what are we gonna do now?

263
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:18,837
[sighs]

264
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:21,381
[Adora] We can bring magic back
to the universe.

265
00:22:22,883 --> 00:22:26,470
What do you guys say to one more
Best Friend Squad road trip?

266
00:22:26,553 --> 00:22:28,138
-[Glimmer] I'm in!
-[Bow] Obviously!

267
00:22:28,221 --> 00:22:30,182
[Catra] Of course I'm going with you,
dummy.

268
00:22:30,265 --> 00:22:32,768
[Adora] Then let's do this. Together.
