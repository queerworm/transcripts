[shouts] Catra, come out.
I know you didn't mean to hit Lonnie.

13

It's okay, I'll tell them.
They won't be mad.

14

But first, you gotta come out
and tell her you're sorry.

I am here to attend to your needs,
little sister.

22
00:02:04,916 --> 00:02:06,251
It is Prime's command.

23

he might as well make it official.

You called me Catra.

Hordak.

35
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:48,126
It is wrong to have a name.

36
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:50,962
Prime's chosen servants
are but parts of the whole.

37
00:02:51,629 --> 00:02:54,549
Look, it's okay. The name thing
can be our secret. It's just--

38
00:02:55,466 --> 00:02:57,719
It's good to see a familiar face.

39

Nope!

46
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:33,254
You can't take apart the ship
while we're inside the ship.

47
00:03:33,421 --> 00:03:37,133
Did you forget about the, I don't know,
crushing void of space?

48
00:03:37,216 --> 00:03:40,845
I love thinking
about the crushing void of space!

49
00:03:41,346 --> 00:03:43,848
But there's always improvements
to be made.

50

-I could boost this baby's speed.
-[drill whirring]

51
00:03:46,434 --> 00:03:50,772
No! We have to keep the ship intact
until we can reach Glimmer.

How's the escape attempt going?

66

[scoffs] You again.
Why do you keep coming back here?

67

Just bored, I guess.

68
00:04:36,067 --> 00:04:39,696
No, I mean,
Horde Prime told you not to talk to me.

69
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:41,447
He's gonna catch you eventually.

70
00:04:41,739 --> 00:04:42,573
Why risk it?

71
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:46,536
You're lonely, aren't you?

You're the prisoner here.

73
00:04:48,913 --> 00:04:51,791
I can go where I want.
So, stay here by yourself for all I care.

74
00:04:51,874 --> 00:04:52,709
Okay, okay.

75
00:04:53,001 --> 00:04:56,045
You're right.
It helps having someone to talk to.

76
00:04:56,337 --> 00:04:59,257
Even if you're the last person
I'd ever wanna be stuck here with.

77
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:02,802
[chuckles] Trust me, Sparkles,
the feeling is mutual.

78
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:15,857
So, what would you be doing
if you were back on Etheria right now

79
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:18,693
and not, you know,
a prisoner on an alien ship?

80
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:20,570
I guess maybe...

81
00:05:22,613 --> 00:05:25,366
Maybe I'd go teleporting
all around Etheria,

82
00:05:25,742 --> 00:05:27,910
visiting the other princesses
in their kingdoms.

83

If it were a really perfect day,

84
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:32,874
Bow, Adora and I
would be having a sleepover. [chuckles]

85
00:05:33,082 --> 00:05:35,835
We'd raid Bright Moon's kitchen for cake
and then we'd eat it

86
00:05:35,918 --> 00:05:37,795
with our hands right off the platter.

87
00:05:38,421 --> 00:05:39,422
We used to have those.

-What?
-Sleepovers.

89
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:43,968
Me and Adora,
when we were cadets in the Horde.

90
00:05:45,219 --> 00:05:48,890
We'd play tricks on Kyle,
stay up all night whispering about...

91
00:05:49,682 --> 00:05:50,558
You know, whatever.

92
00:05:51,517 --> 00:05:55,354
Did Adora still thrash around all night
and, like, sleep-fight?

93
00:05:55,438 --> 00:05:56,689
What was that about?

94
00:05:58,066 --> 00:06:01,694
She always did that.
Adora can't even relax when she's asleep.

95
00:06:04,989 --> 00:06:05,948
I miss them.

96
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:09,327
I was so awful to them
the last time we saw each other.

97
00:06:09,952 --> 00:06:13,164
I'd do anything to go back
and make it right.

98
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:15,708
What about you?

99
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:18,127

if you were back on Etheria?

00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:22,048
Uh, nothing.

102
00:06:22,757 --> 00:06:24,759
There's nothing for me on Etheria.

103
00:06:31,974 --> 00:06:34,393
It's okay! I'll fix Darla.

104
00:06:34,852 --> 00:06:37,188
-Darla?
-I named the ship Darla.

105

It just felt right.

106
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:42,151
Uh... Okay, you can fix Darla.

107
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:44,403
-But we have to be careful.
-[Entrapta] Great!

-Entrapta!
-[laughing]

109
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:51,035
I promise not to move or touch
or break anything.

110
00:06:53,329 --> 00:06:55,123
Okay, I'll be right back.

Sister, thank you for joining us.

125

I have been scouring,
searching for She-Ra,

126
00:08:21,542 --> 00:08:24,962
but what I seek is not yet to be found.

127
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:29,634
My drones recorded a ship
leaving the planet.

128
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,594
A ship of such ancient design

129
00:08:31,677 --> 00:08:34,222
that it is not detectable
by my instruments.

130
00:08:34,889 --> 00:08:36,307
How can this be?

131
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:38,017
I don't know.

132
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:39,852
Hmm...

133
00:08:40,102 --> 00:08:40,937
I don't.

134
00:08:41,145 --> 00:08:44,565
Me and Adora, we're not friends.
I don't know anything about her plans.

135
00:08:46,234 --> 00:08:48,486
And yet you seek to protect her.

136
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:54,450
You have been speaking to our guest,
Queen Glimmer,

137
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:55,660
against my command.

138
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:57,787
Have you not, sister?

139
00:08:58,955 --> 00:09:00,665
You have pity for her.

140
00:09:01,415 --> 00:09:04,085
You will speak to her,
and learn what you can.

141
00:09:04,168 --> 00:09:07,547
She must have some knowledge
of this mysterious ship.

142
00:09:08,256 --> 00:09:09,090
That won't work.

143
00:09:09,298 --> 00:09:11,759
She doesn't trust me.
She's not gonna give me anything.

144
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:16,889
Believe me, if I could tell you
where Adora is I would.

145
00:09:16,973 --> 00:09:17,890
She's my enemy.

146
00:09:18,182 --> 00:09:19,141
I want her gone.

147
00:09:20,142 --> 00:09:23,437
Oh, look at you, poor sister.

148
00:09:23,896 --> 00:09:27,149
Your Adora causes you nothing
but suffering.

You spoke with our little sister
this morning, did you not, brother?

What was it she said to you?

156
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:49,755
She gave me a name.

157
00:09:50,298 --> 00:09:51,507
Forgive me, brother.

<i>All beings must suffer to become pure.</i>

178
00:10:36,093 --> 00:10:38,512
<i>All beings must suffer to become pure.</i>

179
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:40,973
<i>All beings must suffer to become pure.</i>

180
00:10:41,182 --> 00:10:43,517
<i>All beings must suffer to become pure.</i>

181
00:10:43,684 --> 00:10:46,020
<i>All beings must suffer to become pure.</i>

182
00:10:50,107 --> 00:10:52,735
Behold the purest among you.

183
00:10:55,404 --> 00:10:57,448
One to be honored.

184
00:10:58,032 --> 00:10:59,241
[clones] Yes!

185
00:10:59,617 --> 00:11:00,910
Yes!

186
00:11:01,535 --> 00:11:02,787
Yes!

187
00:11:05,581 --> 00:11:09,043
Do what I ask of you.

188
00:11:15,883 --> 00:11:17,510
[gasps] Yes.

189
00:11:21,931 --> 00:11:24,683
-Give us some privacy?
-Of course, sister.

190
00:11:25,059 --> 00:11:26,477
Prime sees all.

191
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:32,108
-What's with the babysitter?
-Here.

192
00:11:32,817 --> 00:11:34,777
It's the dumb food you wanted.

193
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:38,197
You know,
from your perfect day or whatever.

194
00:11:39,698 --> 00:11:41,075
I remember. I just--

195
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:42,993
Thanks.

196
00:11:43,452 --> 00:11:45,413
Don't go thinking
I actually care about you.

197
00:11:45,496 --> 00:11:47,832
I'm supposed to talk to you.
So, eat the stupid cake

198
00:11:47,915 --> 00:11:49,250
and then answer my questions.

199
00:11:52,294 --> 00:11:55,506
-What's going on?
-Don't say anything, just look at me.

200
00:11:55,756 --> 00:11:58,884
An old First Ones ship
left Etheria's atmosphere a few days ago.

201
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:01,804
Prime cannot track it.
What do you know about it?

202
00:12:01,887 --> 00:12:02,847
[gasps]

203
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:06,183
Adora's on that ship, isn't she?

204
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:10,104
You can't tell him. You know
what he'll do to her if he catches her.

205
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:13,232
Adora's on her way here.
She's coming for you.

206
00:12:13,607 --> 00:12:16,527
I don't have to do anything.
I just have to let it happen.

207
00:12:16,861 --> 00:12:18,529
And you think Prime will reward you?

208
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:22,366
As soon as you're no longer useful to him,
he'll get rid of you in a second.

209
00:12:22,616 --> 00:12:24,034
I always find a way out.

210
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,661
So, you'll just run away?

211
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:26,787
To what?

212
00:12:26,912 --> 00:12:28,330
If Prime captures Adora,

213
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:31,667
he can use the Heart of Etheria
to wipe out the whole universe.

214
00:12:31,792 --> 00:12:33,377
Is that what you want?

215
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:36,046
Please, Catra.

216
00:12:36,797 --> 00:12:38,757
Do one good thing in your life.

217
00:12:40,509 --> 00:12:41,343
[shouts]

218
00:12:41,802 --> 00:12:43,387
Don't talk to me like you know me.

219
00:12:43,512 --> 00:12:45,973
You don't know anything about me! Hey!

220
00:12:46,557 --> 00:12:47,391
Let me out!

221
00:12:51,061 --> 00:12:52,771
[crying]

222
00:12:53,772 --> 00:12:54,857
[door beeps]

223
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:57,359
Adora, have you seen Entrapta--? [shouts]

224
00:12:58,152 --> 00:12:59,612
What are you doing?

225
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:01,864
I have everything under control.

226
00:13:02,072 --> 00:13:03,908
That's not what I asked.

227
00:13:04,074 --> 00:13:06,452
I told you not to touch anything.

228
00:13:06,785 --> 00:13:09,413
It's bad enough
that Entrapta has disappeared somewhere.

229
00:13:09,538 --> 00:13:10,372
Oh, yeah.

230
00:13:10,664 --> 00:13:13,751
She was just in here.
She said she was looking for...

231
00:13:14,126 --> 00:13:15,586
Uh...

232
00:13:15,669 --> 00:13:18,547
a blowtorch
and a really long piece of rope.

233
00:13:19,173 --> 00:13:20,758
Why didn't you stop her?

234
00:13:21,425 --> 00:13:23,844
I kind of had my hands full here.

235
00:13:24,178 --> 00:13:27,681
Adora, we are so far out of our depth
right now.

236
00:13:28,057 --> 00:13:32,394
We're about to fly
into the heart of an evil alien empire,

237
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:35,147
and all we've got between us
and certain death

238
00:13:35,231 --> 00:13:37,066
is this falling-apart old ship.

239
00:13:37,358 --> 00:13:39,902
But now the ship's broken,
and we haven't got Glimmer,

240
00:13:39,985 --> 00:13:42,530
and who knows where Entrapta... is.

241
00:13:43,989 --> 00:13:44,823
Hi.

242
00:13:45,157 --> 00:13:47,076
[shouts] What are you doing out there?

243
00:13:47,368 --> 00:13:51,622
I made space suits for us
and then I fixed the ship from space!

244
00:13:51,997 --> 00:13:53,749
Where I am!

245
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:56,877
[Adora]
Oh, so that's what the rope was for.

246
00:14:03,926 --> 00:14:06,220
Is this a good laugh or a bad laugh?

247
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:10,558
Well, the longer it goes on
the more I think it's a bad laugh.

248
00:14:12,726 --> 00:14:15,604
Entrapta, get inside.

249
00:14:15,729 --> 00:14:17,481
Adora, put down the tape.

250
00:14:17,815 --> 00:14:23,237
We're just going to get back on mission,
and nothing is going to derail us again!

251
00:14:23,654 --> 00:14:25,281
[ship powering down]

252
00:14:27,616 --> 00:14:28,659
I got it.

253
00:14:28,742 --> 00:14:29,785
[shouts]

254
00:14:30,786 --> 00:14:32,288
It is as our sister said.

255
00:14:32,496 --> 00:14:34,915
We have done a sweep of all quadrants
in our vicinity,

256
00:14:35,124 --> 00:14:37,126
and we have located the Etherian ship.

257
00:14:37,418 --> 00:14:38,544
It is almost here.

258
00:14:38,836 --> 00:14:41,422
You have done well, little sister.

259
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:44,675
Soon, She-Ra will be mine.

260
00:14:45,092 --> 00:14:46,927
And with her, Etheria.

261
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:48,637
All because of you.

262
00:14:51,265 --> 00:14:53,267
You made the right choice.

263
00:14:53,684 --> 00:14:56,270
You will be exalted, raised up

264
00:14:56,353 --> 00:14:59,899
above the other wretched creatures
of your home world.

265
00:15:00,274 --> 00:15:02,067
Is that not what you wanted?

266
00:15:07,323 --> 00:15:08,490
Yes, Lord Prime.

267
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:11,243
Go now in peace.

268
00:15:16,165 --> 00:15:17,374
[Catra sobbing]

269
00:15:21,003 --> 00:15:21,837
[Adora] Catra?

270
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:25,049
It's dinnertime, and you're missing it.

271
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:30,930
It's the gray kind tonight.

272
00:15:31,513 --> 00:15:33,057
I know it's your favorite.

273
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:39,313
What are you doing?

274
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:43,192
Well, if you're missing dinner,
then I am, too.

275
00:15:43,734 --> 00:15:46,654
Just go!
Eat with your new best friend, Lonnie!

276
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:48,614
Is that why you hit her?

277
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:51,241
I know you like her better than me.

278
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:54,578
You're supposed to be my friend.

279
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:57,331
I am your friend, Catra.

280
00:15:57,706 --> 00:15:59,917
I'm always gonna be your friend.

281
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:06,632
You should say sorry to Lonnie.

282
00:16:06,757 --> 00:16:08,801
And then we can all be friends.

283
00:16:09,259 --> 00:16:10,386
[grunting]

284
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:11,303
No.

285
00:16:14,223 --> 00:16:16,266
Come on, Catra.

286
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:19,395
[Catra]
I'll never say sorry to anybody, ever.

287
00:16:25,901 --> 00:16:27,194
[kids giggling]

288
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:42,209
I'm always gonna be your friend.

289
00:16:56,265 --> 00:16:57,141
[shouting]

290
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:01,937
It's nothing personal, Hordak.

291
00:17:06,316 --> 00:17:07,151
I'm coming in.

292
00:17:15,492 --> 00:17:16,368
What are you doing?

293
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:20,372
I wanna do that one good thing in my life.
Like you said.

294
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,708
So, come with me.

295
00:17:32,468 --> 00:17:33,469
Where are we going?

296
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:36,555
What's the plan?
How do I know I can trust you?

297
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:37,765
You don't.

298
00:17:38,766 --> 00:17:39,600
[gasps]

299
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:48,358
Little sister,
why is our guest out of her quarters?

300
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:50,527
She wanted to get some fresh air.

301
00:17:50,778 --> 00:17:52,571
Didn't you, princess?

302
00:18:02,873 --> 00:18:05,459
Hit the back of the neck.
That should take them down.

303
00:18:08,462 --> 00:18:10,631
-[chuckles] Not bad, Sparkles.
-[alarm wailing]

304
00:18:11,423 --> 00:18:12,257
Let's go.

305
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:21,934
-What are you doing?
-What does it look like?

306
00:18:22,017 --> 00:18:23,185
Getting you out of here.

307
00:18:27,147 --> 00:18:28,440
Good. That should hold them.

308
00:18:29,024 --> 00:18:31,819
Wait, are you--? Are you saving me?

309
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:33,779
Not you. Adora.

310
00:18:33,987 --> 00:18:37,032
Even if I sent her a message to stay away,
she'd still come for you.

311
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:38,826
That's just how she is.

312
00:18:39,159 --> 00:18:40,369
[banging on door]

313
00:18:40,452 --> 00:18:42,037
[clones grunting]

314
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:43,997
What about you?

315
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:47,501
Me? All I do is hurt people.

316
00:18:48,043 --> 00:18:50,838
There's no one left in the entire universe
who cares about me.

317
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:53,382
Is it working now?

318
00:18:53,715 --> 00:18:54,967
Are you there, Darla?

319
00:18:56,593 --> 00:19:01,056
-[computer] <i>Yes. Welcome back, Entrapta.</i>
-[shouts] I missed you.

320
00:19:02,224 --> 00:19:04,268
<i>There is a transmission being received.</i>

321
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:08,188
-<i>Would you like to open communication?</i>
-Patch it through.

322
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:09,690
[Catra] <i>Adora?</i>

323
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:10,649
Catra?

324
00:19:10,899 --> 00:19:13,694
Don't sound so happy to hear me.
I'm sending Glimmer to you.

325
00:19:13,944 --> 00:19:16,780
I don't know your location,
but I can get her to your quadrant.

326
00:19:17,197 --> 00:19:20,117
-You have to be there to catch her.
-Wait, wait, wait, what?

327
00:19:20,367 --> 00:19:22,911
What's going on? Glimmer is with you?

328
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:29,084
We don't have time.
You need to get to these coordinates now.

329
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:31,336
Don't come here, no matter what.

330
00:19:32,254 --> 00:19:33,964
Horde Prime is ready for you.

331
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:37,092
Catra, I don't understand, what is--?

332
00:19:37,426 --> 00:19:38,260
<i>Just listen!</i>

333
00:19:39,344 --> 00:19:40,179
Adora...

334
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:41,346
I'm sorry.

335
00:19:43,098 --> 00:19:44,266
For everything.

336
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:52,024
Catra!

337
00:19:52,524 --> 00:19:55,611
-[radio static]
-No. No, no, no!

338
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:57,029
Catra! Come back!

339
00:19:57,112 --> 00:19:59,406
[computer]
<i>The communication channel is closed.</i>

340
00:19:59,698 --> 00:20:03,702
Entrapta, do whatever it takes
to get us to those coordinates.

341
00:20:15,589 --> 00:20:17,674
[Entrapta] <i>We are arriving</i>
<i>at the coordinates.</i>

342
00:20:17,758 --> 00:20:19,134
Copy that. We're ready.

343
00:20:31,271 --> 00:20:32,314
There!

344
00:20:36,568 --> 00:20:37,402
Glimmer!

346
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:11,103
-Glimmer.
-Glimmer.

Bow?

348
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:14,106
Adora?

349
00:21:16,358 --> 00:21:18,652
-What happened back there?
-I think--

350
00:21:19,403 --> 00:21:21,154
I think Catra saved me.

351
00:21:22,197 --> 00:21:23,740
I think she saved us all.

352
00:21:36,753 --> 00:21:40,173
The Etherian ship has changed course...

353
00:21:41,591 --> 00:21:44,511
but your treachery will not save them.

354
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:48,724
There is no darkness
that my light cannot pierce,

355
00:21:48,932 --> 00:21:51,727
no distance that my hand cannot reach.

356
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:55,647
[clones] <i>Prime casts out all shadows.</i>
<i>Prime casts out all shadows.</i>

357
00:21:56,106 --> 00:21:59,234
They will not be able
to hide from me forever!

358
00:22:01,403 --> 00:22:07,576
You were beloved in my sight
and this is how you repay me.

359
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:14,750
What did you expect?

360
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:20,088
After all,
us Etherians are so very emotional.

361
00:22:20,881 --> 00:22:23,008
It doesn't matter what you do to me.

362
00:22:23,091 --> 00:22:24,176
Glimmer is gone

363
00:22:24,259 --> 00:22:26,887
and you will never
get your hands on Adora.

364
00:22:27,554 --> 00:22:31,725
Oh, my child, you're wrong.

365
00:22:32,184 --> 00:22:35,145
Everyone has a place in my empire.

366
00:22:36,438 --> 00:22:40,442
You will be of use to me yet.

367
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:44,946
