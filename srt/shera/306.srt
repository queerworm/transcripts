1
00:00:21,354 --> 00:00:22,397
Woo-hoo!

2
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:24,733
[both laughing]

3
00:00:35,326 --> 00:00:38,705
{\an8}That was awesome.
Can we do it one more time?

4
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:42,667
Oh, that's quite enough for today.
Besides--

5
00:00:42,751 --> 00:00:44,711
[Micah] Did you two go flying without me?

6
00:00:46,755 --> 00:00:47,714
[laughs]

7
00:00:47,797 --> 00:00:50,717
[gasps] Dad. You're back.

8
00:00:51,843 --> 00:00:52,719
Think fast.

9
00:00:54,679 --> 00:00:55,764
[laughs]

10
00:00:56,264 --> 00:00:58,558
{\an8}[laughs] You're getting good at that.

11
00:00:58,641 --> 00:01:00,518
{\an8}-I've been practicing.
-[Angella] Yes.

12
00:01:00,602 --> 00:01:02,979
She only blew up my flower garden twice.

13
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:06,024
{\an8}Welcome home, love.

14
00:01:06,775 --> 00:01:10,945
{\an8}You were having so much fun without me,
you can't have missed me much.

15
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:12,280
[all laughing]

16
00:01:12,363 --> 00:01:13,531
Dad.

17
00:01:13,823 --> 00:01:14,908
Your Majesties.

18
00:01:15,867 --> 00:01:19,954
We caught a girl sneaking into Bright Moon
from the Whispering Woods,

19
00:01:20,038 --> 00:01:22,040
{\an8}trying to break
into the princess' chambers.

20
00:01:22,123 --> 00:01:25,627
{\an8}What? Please, escort the princess safely
to her room

21
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:28,421
until we determine
the trespasser's intentions.

22
00:01:36,387 --> 00:01:37,764
[gasps] Glimmer.

00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:20,974
[sighs]

34
00:02:24,352 --> 00:02:25,353
[shouts]

35
00:02:26,271 --> 00:02:29,607
Glimmer. What is going on?
Everyone's really freaked out.

36
00:02:29,691 --> 00:02:33,945
There's a trespasser in Bright Moon.
We need to figure out who she is.

37
00:02:35,613 --> 00:02:37,991
Why do we need to figure out who she is?

38
00:02:38,074 --> 00:02:38,908
Because...

39
00:02:39,576 --> 00:02:40,702
I don't know.

40
00:02:40,785 --> 00:02:45,790
I just feel like I know her somehow,
so, we're gonna sneak in and spy

41
00:02:45,874 --> 00:02:48,376
-while my parents interrogate her.
-What?

42
00:02:48,459 --> 00:02:53,256
I know it sounds crazy. But she came here
for a reason, and I need to know why.

43
00:02:53,339 --> 00:02:55,550
If you wanna stay behind, just tell me.

44
00:02:55,633 --> 00:02:57,510
-[mumbling] I want to stay behind.
-Hmm.

45
00:02:57,594 --> 00:02:59,429
Didn't hear anything. Let's go.

46
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:05,351
Bring in the prisoner.

47
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:14,569
King Micah? You're here?
Oh, you look different than your mural.

48
00:03:22,744 --> 00:03:23,620
[shouts]

49
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:28,124
This is a truth spell.
You will be compelled to answer honestly.

50
00:03:28,207 --> 00:03:32,211
Now tell us, who are you,
and why did you break into Bright Moon?

51
00:03:32,795 --> 00:03:36,841
Okay. Wow, this is gonna be
a lot to explain. Um, ahem...

52
00:03:37,425 --> 00:03:41,638
And it's gonna sound a little weird,
but I swear, it's all true. [sighs]

53
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:45,225
Reality is collapsing in on itself
because of the portal

54
00:03:45,308 --> 00:03:47,727
that Hordak and Catra set off.
They're from the Horde,

55
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:51,105
except you don't remember the Horde,
because the Fright Zone disappeared,

56
00:03:51,189 --> 00:03:52,899
like, just now. It was pretty crazy.

57
00:03:52,982 --> 00:03:56,110
It got erased by the portal.
But I promise it used to exist,

58
00:03:56,194 --> 00:03:58,571
and we were fighting them
with the Princess Alliance.

59
00:03:58,655 --> 00:04:01,574
I had a sword that could turn me
into an 8-foot-tall warrior lady

60
00:04:01,658 --> 00:04:02,992
with great hair named She-Ra,

61
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:05,370
but the Horde used the sword
to set off the portal,

62
00:04:05,453 --> 00:04:08,206
and I need Glimmer and Bow
to help stop it and save Etheria.

63
00:04:08,289 --> 00:04:09,415
[panting]

64
00:04:09,999 --> 00:04:12,710
I... Uh...

65
00:04:13,294 --> 00:04:14,128
Who are you?

66
00:04:14,212 --> 00:04:17,131
How do you know my daughter
and the royal apprentice historian?

67
00:04:17,215 --> 00:04:18,549
He's a historian here?

68
00:04:19,008 --> 00:04:21,386
That doesn't matter. We're best friends.

69
00:04:21,469 --> 00:04:23,388
I've never seen you before.

70
00:04:24,222 --> 00:04:26,849
Well, that's because normally you're dead.

71
00:04:27,392 --> 00:04:28,768
[gasps]

72
00:04:29,227 --> 00:04:30,979
Are you threatening the king?

73
00:04:31,062 --> 00:04:33,231
How dare you say such a thing?

74
00:04:33,314 --> 00:04:36,067
I'm sorry, but none of this is right.

75
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:37,735
You must have noticed it.

76
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:41,656
What did you do yesterday?
There's a reason you can't remember.

77
00:04:41,739 --> 00:04:43,658
This world is not real.

78
00:04:44,367 --> 00:04:46,452
I have heard quite enough.

79
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:49,289
Angella, it's all right.

80
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:54,794
I need to talk to Bow and Glimmer.
They're the strongest people I know.

81
00:04:54,877 --> 00:04:57,964
I need their help
to stop reality from falling apart.

82
00:04:58,756 --> 00:05:00,883
Guards, escort this woman
to our holding cell.

83
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:05,388
The spare room.

84
00:05:08,433 --> 00:05:11,269
Wait. You have to believe me.

85
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:13,604
Don't listen to her. She's lying.

86
00:05:13,688 --> 00:05:16,691
-But your truth spell...
-I must have done it wrong.

87
00:05:16,774 --> 00:05:20,069
There's no way anything she said
could be true. It's-- It's not possible.

88
00:05:35,793 --> 00:05:36,794
[groans]

89
00:05:38,379 --> 00:05:40,131
Bow. Glimmer.

90
00:05:40,715 --> 00:05:42,091
I knew you guys would--

91
00:05:43,468 --> 00:05:45,470
Do you remember me at all?

92
00:05:45,553 --> 00:05:50,433
Listen, crazy lady.
My dad has never messed up a spell.

93
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:53,811
You were telling the truth in there.
How can that be?

94
00:05:53,895 --> 00:05:57,065
Of course you were listening in.
I should've known.

95
00:05:57,148 --> 00:06:00,610
Okay, will you stop acting
like you know us? We've never met you.

96
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:02,070
[Adora] Yes, you have.

97
00:06:02,153 --> 00:06:05,490
Bow, you saved our lives
more times than I can count.

98
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:08,576
You're a great fighter, a genius inventor,

99
00:06:08,659 --> 00:06:10,953
and you shouldn't worry
about what your dads think.

100
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:13,456
They're proud of you, just like I am.

101
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:18,044
And, Glimmer, you never give up,
and you never admit defeat.

102
00:06:18,127 --> 00:06:19,879
I know making friends is hard for you,

103
00:06:19,962 --> 00:06:22,173
yet you're the one
who pulled us all together.

104
00:06:22,256 --> 00:06:24,217
I've never met anyone like you.

105
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:29,180
None of that is true. I'm just a princess.

106
00:06:29,263 --> 00:06:32,016
-And Bow isn't a fighter. He's Bow.
-[gasps]

107
00:06:34,936 --> 00:06:37,730
This-- This isn't right?

108
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:40,399
I mean, everything is perfect.

109
00:06:40,483 --> 00:06:43,277
Everyone keeps saying
everything is perfect.

110
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:48,741
My dad...

111
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:52,787
He's gone, isn't he?

112
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:55,915
Yes.

113
00:06:57,208 --> 00:06:58,334
I'm sorry, Glimmer.

114
00:06:58,793 --> 00:06:59,627
[explosion nearby]

115
00:07:01,629 --> 00:07:03,089
Uh... What's that?

116
00:07:03,172 --> 00:07:05,508
[Adora] It's starting to happen here, too.

117
00:07:05,591 --> 00:07:07,009
We don't have much time.

118
00:07:08,553 --> 00:07:12,765
-So, what do we do now?
-We fix reality, uh, somehow.

119
00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:16,060
Look, Razz told me to go back
to the beginning,

120
00:07:16,144 --> 00:07:18,104
but I don't know what that means.

121
00:07:18,187 --> 00:07:21,274
Okay, well,
you said a portal did all of this.

122
00:07:21,357 --> 00:07:23,901
Can you think of anyone
who'd know how to make a--?

123
00:07:25,778 --> 00:07:26,821
Entrapta.

124
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:29,157
Of course. Entrapta.

125
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,159
Glimmer, can you teleport us to Dryl?

126
00:07:31,242 --> 00:07:34,328
What? I barely managed
to teleport me and Bow in here.

127
00:07:34,412 --> 00:07:37,248
Then we'll just have to do this
the Best Friend Squad way.

128
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:41,252
Run! Go. Go. Go.

129
00:07:41,335 --> 00:07:43,546
This is how we normally do things?

130
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:44,755
Yeah. We improvise.

131
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:47,508
I really don't like improvising.

132
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:52,138
We have to get out of Bright Moon
before it disappears like the Fright Zone.

133
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:55,850
[grunting]

134
00:07:56,934 --> 00:07:58,644
Princess, you shouldn't be--

135
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:01,105
Is that the prisoner?

136
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:02,023
[shouting]

137
00:08:03,524 --> 00:08:04,525
Sorry.

138
00:08:08,196 --> 00:08:09,447
There was a door here.

139
00:08:10,364 --> 00:08:11,616
Uh, guys?

140
00:08:13,868 --> 00:08:15,495
Step away from my daughter.

141
00:08:15,578 --> 00:08:17,038
Now.

142
00:08:17,622 --> 00:08:20,541
Mom, stop. Can't you see what's happening?

143
00:08:30,927 --> 00:08:31,761
Angie?

144
00:08:32,803 --> 00:08:33,804
[gasps]

145
00:08:34,388 --> 00:08:35,389
What's wrong?

146
00:08:35,473 --> 00:08:38,726
I'm sorry, for everything.

147
00:08:38,809 --> 00:08:40,770
But we have to make this right. [shouts]

148
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:42,396
[all shouting]

149
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,356
Glimmer.

150
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:53,574
[Entrapta] Hello.

151
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:57,745
Do I know you?

152
00:09:06,837 --> 00:09:07,922
Angie?

153
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,551
We'll get her back, Angie.

154
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:15,137
And then everything will be perfect again.

155
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:21,477
This is perfect, my love,
but it's not real.

156
00:09:23,145 --> 00:09:24,647
I remember now.

157
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:31,529
I miss you so much.

158
00:09:32,905 --> 00:09:35,157
But Glimmer needs my help,

159
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:38,411
and I can't stay
with nothing but memories.

160
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:40,746
Angella? I--

161
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:42,081
Goodbye, Micah.

162
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:52,341
Angie. Angella, wait. I'm not--

163
00:10:07,189 --> 00:10:09,066
This is fascinating.

164
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:13,988
I've never had non-robots visit me before.
Usually it's just me and all my friends.

165
00:10:15,948 --> 00:10:16,782
Friends?

166
00:10:20,703 --> 00:10:22,371
Aren't they amazing?

167
00:10:22,872 --> 00:10:26,208
And if they break,
I can just make new friends. [laughs]

168
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:27,460
Tiny snacks?

169
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:37,261
Oh, sorry about that.

170
00:10:37,345 --> 00:10:40,348
They're still getting the hang
of people food.

171
00:10:40,431 --> 00:10:42,141
Unless this is what you eat.

172
00:10:42,224 --> 00:10:44,644
I have so many questions.
Tell me everything.

173
00:10:44,727 --> 00:10:48,356
Entrapta, I know
what I'm about to say sounds crazy--

174
00:10:48,439 --> 00:10:52,026
Is this about the unstable portal
slowly consuming and warping our reality?

175
00:10:52,109 --> 00:10:54,403
You're not gonna believe--
What did you just say?

176
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:56,656
Oh, I figured it out a while ago.

177
00:10:56,739 --> 00:11:00,326
An unstable portal is the only thing
that would account for all the anomalies

178
00:11:00,409 --> 00:11:02,078
I've been picking up in my research.

179
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:05,081
The portal exists somewhere in our world,

180
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:08,584
and as long as it's still open,
it's gonna keep destabilizing reality,

181
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:13,089
making things disappear faster and faster,
until, bam, there's nothing left.

182
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:14,256
[laughing]

183
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:16,759
Which is a bad thing.

184
00:11:16,842 --> 00:11:19,512
-How do we stop it?
-Portals are gateways,

185
00:11:19,595 --> 00:11:23,182
wormholes that connect one area
of space to another.

186
00:11:23,265 --> 00:11:25,768
The only way to turn it off
is from the inside.

187
00:11:25,851 --> 00:11:29,021
But whoever shuts
the portal down can't leave.

188
00:11:29,105 --> 00:11:31,982
They'll be trapped between realities,
possibly forever.

189
00:11:32,066 --> 00:11:35,277
Oh, imagine the data they could collect.

190
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:39,782
Wait, so, whoever turns it off
will be trapped inside it forever?

191
00:11:39,865 --> 00:11:42,993
-Exactly.
-There must be another way.

192
00:11:43,077 --> 00:11:47,081
Try to remember, Entrapta, when you
and Hordak built the Portal Machine.

193
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:50,501
Remember.

194
00:11:51,335 --> 00:11:53,629
I remember.

195
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:57,383
I had a lab partner, Hordak.

196
00:11:57,842 --> 00:12:01,512
Mm... We were friends, and then Catra...

197
00:12:02,513 --> 00:12:05,683
Oh. I remember everything now.

198
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:08,894
I'm not really here.

199
00:12:08,978 --> 00:12:09,895
[gasps]

200
00:12:12,064 --> 00:12:15,901
No. No, this can't be happening already.
We should have more time.

201
00:12:15,985 --> 00:12:17,820
There is no more time.

202
00:12:18,446 --> 00:12:21,490
It all makes sense now. It's your sword.

203
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:23,409
That portal is centered on you.

204
00:12:23,492 --> 00:12:24,910
It's following you.

205
00:12:25,661 --> 00:12:26,495
What?

206
00:12:28,164 --> 00:12:29,248
No!

207
00:12:29,331 --> 00:12:32,084
You need to remove the sword
from the inside.

208
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:33,878
It's powering the portal.

209
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:37,798
As soon as it's gone,
everything will be right again.

210
00:12:37,882 --> 00:12:40,176
It was nice being friends with you.

211
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:41,927
Entrapta.

212
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:43,387
[both groaning]

213
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:53,230
-Where are we?
-We're at the Beacon.

214
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:55,441
[gasps]

215
00:12:57,485 --> 00:12:58,360
Stars?

216
00:13:05,117 --> 00:13:07,745
Adora, what is happening?

217
00:13:07,828 --> 00:13:11,916
It's what Entrapta said.
Reality is unraveling faster now. I--

218
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:15,794
I think we might be too late. [gasps]

219
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:20,216
Mara?

220
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:24,512
[gasps]

221
00:13:35,064 --> 00:13:36,190
Stay here.

222
00:13:36,273 --> 00:13:38,359
Entrapta said the portal
is centered on me.

223
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:42,780
You're at risk as long as we're together.
If I draw it away--

224
00:13:42,863 --> 00:13:46,367
No. I know what you're thinking, Adora.

225
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:49,119
You said you knew us? Well, we know you.

226
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,417
You can't relax to save your life.

227
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:57,127
You're terrible at acting.

228
00:13:57,711 --> 00:14:01,632
You're stubborn and headstrong,
and you're our best friend.

229
00:14:07,054 --> 00:14:08,305
Wait. No.

230
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:09,223
No.

231
00:14:09,306 --> 00:14:12,226
You got this, Adora. We believe in you.

232
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:16,438
[sobbing]

233
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:28,993
[in distorted voice] Hey, Adora.

234
00:14:32,246 --> 00:14:33,289
[grunts]

235
00:14:37,293 --> 00:14:38,419
Oh...

236
00:14:39,044 --> 00:14:40,880
Where are your friends?

237
00:14:42,923 --> 00:14:47,052
-Catra, stop. You have to--
-It's always the same with you, Adora.

238
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:50,139
"I have to do this.
Oh, we have to do that."

239
00:14:50,222 --> 00:14:54,560
Let's be honest,
all of this is your fault.

240
00:14:57,104 --> 00:14:58,814
If you hadn't gotten captured,

241
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:01,650
your sword wouldn't have opened
the portal.

242
00:15:02,818 --> 00:15:04,194
[grunting]

243
00:15:12,328 --> 00:15:16,832
If you hadn't gotten the sword
and been the world's worst She-Ra,

244
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:18,834
none of this would've happened.

245
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:20,085
[shouting]

246
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:27,927
Admit it, Adora,
the world would still be standing

247
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:31,430
if you had never come through that portal
in the first place.

248
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:36,435
You made me this.

249
00:15:39,563 --> 00:15:42,191
You took everything from me.

250
00:15:45,194 --> 00:15:49,823
You broke the world,
and it is all your fault.

251
00:15:51,992 --> 00:15:53,160
No, it's not.

252
00:15:54,244 --> 00:15:56,163
I didn't make you pull the switch.

253
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:01,835
I didn't make you do anything.

254
00:16:03,587 --> 00:16:05,089
I didn't break the world,

255
00:16:05,673 --> 00:16:07,383
but I am gonna fix it.

256
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:08,342
And you?

257
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:10,511
You made your choice.

258
00:16:12,513 --> 00:16:13,847
Now live with it.

259
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:26,860
[shouting]

260
00:16:45,379 --> 00:16:46,672
-[Angella] Adora.
-[gasps]

261
00:16:47,423 --> 00:16:48,507
Hold on.

262
00:16:56,724 --> 00:17:00,102
I remember, Adora.
I know this world isn't our own.

263
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:01,478
How do we fix this?

264
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:16,785
[Adora] Go back to the beginning.

265
00:17:17,327 --> 00:17:18,787
Razz meant my beginning.

266
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:22,750
To the place I came through as a baby.
I can fix everything.

267
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:26,253
I just need to go into the portal
and pull out the sword.

268
00:17:26,336 --> 00:17:29,965
That'll turn it off and everyone
will come back safe and sound.

269
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:31,550
And you'll come back safe, too?

270
00:17:34,344 --> 00:17:36,680
Adora, you'll come back, too, right?

271
00:17:36,764 --> 00:17:38,015
I have to do this.

272
00:17:38,098 --> 00:17:39,850
This is my destiny.

273
00:17:40,684 --> 00:17:41,977
Oh, Adora, no.

274
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:43,937
This is not it.

275
00:17:45,022 --> 00:17:48,650
But... this is the only way to fix things.

276
00:17:49,777 --> 00:17:51,487
Do you want to know a secret?

277
00:17:52,321 --> 00:17:54,448
I am a coward.

278
00:17:55,032 --> 00:17:57,159
What? No.

279
00:17:57,701 --> 00:18:00,245
I've always been the queen
who stays behind.

280
00:18:00,788 --> 00:18:02,664
Micah was the brave one.

281
00:18:03,123 --> 00:18:04,124
And then Glimmer...

282
00:18:05,459 --> 00:18:06,335
Oh, Glimmer.

283
00:18:06,877 --> 00:18:08,837
So much like her father.

284
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:11,298
And once again I stayed behind,

285
00:18:11,882 --> 00:18:16,011
letting her make the hard choices,
letting her be brave for me.

286
00:18:17,054 --> 00:18:19,389
I told myself I was being responsible,

287
00:18:19,473 --> 00:18:22,810
but, Adora, I was just scared.

288
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:25,604
And then I met you.

289
00:18:25,687 --> 00:18:30,400
You inspired us. You inspired me.

290
00:18:30,484 --> 00:18:34,863
Not because it was your destiny,
but because you never let fear stop you.

291
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:39,159
And now I choose to be brave.

292
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:40,619
[gasps]

293
00:18:42,454 --> 00:18:44,123
No. Your Majesty.

294
00:18:44,206 --> 00:18:45,332
Angella.

295
00:18:59,763 --> 00:19:00,806
[grunting]

296
00:19:09,022 --> 00:19:10,816
Take care of each other.

297
00:19:33,922 --> 00:19:38,051
For the honor of Grayskull.

298
00:19:53,901 --> 00:19:55,027
Huh?

299
00:20:08,332 --> 00:20:09,458
[shouting]

300
00:20:14,338 --> 00:20:16,381
We have to go now.

301
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:35,567
[Bow &amp; Glimmer] Adora.

302
00:20:35,651 --> 00:20:36,693
[Glimmer chuckles]

303
00:20:37,152 --> 00:20:39,238
See? We told you, you could do it.

304
00:20:39,321 --> 00:20:42,491
[Frosta] Woo-hoo! Yes, we did it.
We did it.

305
00:20:42,574 --> 00:20:45,244
[Shadow Weaver]
Touching as this is, we need to go.

306
00:20:46,161 --> 00:20:47,120
Now.

307
00:20:58,715 --> 00:20:59,549
[groaning]

308
00:21:21,863 --> 00:21:23,740
[all laughing and shouting]

309
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:26,076
[Bow] We did it.

310
00:21:27,202 --> 00:21:29,246
Did we do it? We did it.

311
00:21:29,329 --> 00:21:32,040
I'm probably going to be grounded
for the rest of my life,

312
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:35,252
but reality is back to normal.

313
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:39,423
Speaking of which,
I guess I should go find my mom.

314
00:21:39,923 --> 00:21:43,302
Maybe she'll be so happy to see me
that she'll forget about grounding me.

315
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:45,637
Adora, what is it?

316
00:21:51,685 --> 00:21:52,644
Angella,

317
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:55,105
she stayed behind. She--

318
00:21:56,106 --> 00:21:56,940
She--

319
00:21:58,984 --> 00:22:00,068
She saved us.

320
00:22:19,379 --> 00:22:20,589
[beeping]

321
00:22:23,467 --> 00:22:28,055
[Horde Prime] So, that's where
you've been, little brother.

322
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:44,362
[closing theme playing]
