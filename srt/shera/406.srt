{\an8}Good morning, world.
Force Captain Scorpia, reporting for duty.

00:00:33,116 --> 00:00:33,950
Ah.

00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:35,410
{\an8}Wake up, check.

{\an8}Looking sharp, check.

00:00:41,291 --> 00:00:42,459
{\an8}Breathe in new day.

{\an8}Check.

Make bed, check.

10
00:00:50,341 --> 00:00:53,928
Feed Emily, although
I'm still not sure that you eat, check.

00:00:55,388 --> 00:00:57,098
Hey, careful there.

12
00:01:01,853 --> 00:01:04,981
Cool, right?
Catra gave it to me in the Crimson Waste.

13
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:08,151
She's got a matching one.
It's, like, our thing, you know?

14
00:01:10,403 --> 00:01:13,656
I know, I know,
she said we're not friends anymore,

15
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:15,241
but she didn't mean it.

16
00:01:15,325 --> 00:01:17,827
And maybe I misheard her,
there was a lot going on.

17
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:19,037
There was a cannon.

I had that one!

52
00:03:21,743 --> 00:03:25,204
You are the queen.
I can't let anything happen to you.

53
00:03:25,288 --> 00:03:27,665
Besides, whatever dark magic
Shadow Weaver taught you

54
00:03:27,749 --> 00:03:29,918
obviously didn't seem to be doing the job.

55
00:03:30,001 --> 00:03:31,794
It's not dark magic.

56
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:35,506
And it would've been really cool
if it had worked.

57
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:40,678
Aw, you guys. Look at us.

Thank you so much for letting me come!

Where's the rest?

00:03:54,734 --> 00:03:56,361
There aren't even any bots.

63
00:03:56,444 --> 00:03:59,697
I didn't see any others.
They probably ran away scared.

64
00:03:59,781 --> 00:04:01,783
All right, we should head out.

65
00:04:01,866 --> 00:04:03,826
We've still got another outpost
to shut down

66
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:06,537
before we can re-open supply lines
to the Kingdom of Snows.

[Flutterina] Wasn't She-Ra amazing
in that battle?

You are so lucky she saved you
before that Horde soldier reached you.

70
00:04:16,172 --> 00:04:20,093
She didn't save me. I was doing a thing.

71
00:04:20,176 --> 00:04:21,594
Oh, right.

72
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:24,722
I mean, your little magic trick
would've been cool if it had worked.

73
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:27,350
Anyway, your real strength is in teamwork.

74
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:31,020
And the way you let Adora give you orders
even though you're the queen, I--

75
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:33,856
She wasn't giving me orders. We're a team.

76
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,358
The greatest team!

77
00:04:35,441 --> 00:04:39,279
That's why she can talk to you like that,
all, "I'm She-Ra, I know best."

78
00:04:39,362 --> 00:04:41,948
But you stay friends. What a bond.

00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:58,881
The Rebellion is dismantling
our Northern Perimeter.

84
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:02,343
Why are our outposts
unprepared for an attack?

85
00:05:02,427 --> 00:05:06,389
Because they're skeleton crews.
I called back the main defenses.

86
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:08,599
What? Why?

88
00:05:10,935 --> 00:05:11,853
Okay.

Let them waste their time
on some useless outposts.

We are saving our resources
for the big mission.

The final part of our plan, remember?
It's almost time.

93
00:05:29,037 --> 00:05:32,915
We're not ready.
I need more time to complete the weapon.

94
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:36,836
We've put everything into this plan.
We don't have more time.

95
00:05:36,919 --> 00:05:40,757
This technology
is based on Entrapta's research,

96
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,925
but I've reached a dead end.

97
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:45,845
I need her notes, her recordings.

98
00:05:46,471 --> 00:05:49,682
They must hold the key
to making this work.

99
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:52,226
Entrapta is a traitor.

100
00:05:53,478 --> 00:05:55,396
You think I don't know that?

101
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:57,607
This is what she left behind.

102
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:02,779
And this is what I will use
to defeat every last Princess on Etheria.

103
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:05,198
Horde Prime will be here soon.

104
00:06:05,281 --> 00:06:08,951
And when he arrives,
he will see what I am capable of.

105
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:13,915
I will return to his side,
victorious, worthy.

106
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:19,295
But first, I need those recordings.

107
00:06:25,468 --> 00:06:26,969

you're supposed to stay in my room.

111
00:06:36,604 --> 00:06:37,605
You little scamp.

112
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:42,610
Come on, no guilt-trip.
It's for your own good.

113
00:06:42,693 --> 00:06:44,028
We can't let Catra see you.

114
00:06:44,112 --> 00:06:47,824
And right now I'm bringing her a cup
of my famous soothing tea.

115
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:49,200
Old family recipe.

116
00:06:49,283 --> 00:06:52,203
If anyone could use a pick-me-up,
it's Catra.

117
00:06:56,457 --> 00:06:57,291
Go on.

118
00:07:04,382 --> 00:07:08,386
Okay, you can come.
Can't say no to that cute little face.

119
00:07:09,178 --> 00:07:11,889
-Hey, where are you--?
-[Catra] Who are you talking to?

120
00:07:11,973 --> 00:07:14,100
Catra! Oh! Hot!

121
00:07:14,183 --> 00:07:18,104
Okay. Boy, wow, you can really,
ha, ha, sneak up on a gal. Ahem.

122
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:24,068
Are you okay? You don't look so good.
Have you been getting enough sleep?

123
00:07:24,152 --> 00:07:26,696
-Here, I made you some--
-I didn't ask for your opinion.

124
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:29,615
I have a job for you.
I need you to find Entrapta's recordings.

125
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:31,909
That thingy she was always babbling into.

126
00:07:31,993 --> 00:07:34,829
You want Entrapta's recordings?
Does this mean--?

127
00:07:34,912 --> 00:07:37,540
It means that Hordak needs them.

128
00:07:38,499 --> 00:07:39,459
I'm so close.

129
00:07:40,042 --> 00:07:44,005
If I can pull this off, everything,
everything will have been worth it.

130
00:07:44,088 --> 00:07:46,466
Find me those recordings
so I can finish this.

131
00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:48,676
Yes! Yes, I'll find them, I promise.

132
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:50,720
Did you want any of the tea?

133
00:07:51,387 --> 00:07:53,014
You know what, it's not a--

134
00:07:56,767 --> 00:07:59,103
What are you still doing here? [growls]

135
00:08:06,194 --> 00:08:10,031
See, Emily, what did I tell you?
Catra just needed a loyal friend.

136
00:08:10,114 --> 00:08:12,366
I'll find those recordings
and then she can relax

137
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:14,118
and things will go back to normal.

138
00:08:14,452 --> 00:08:16,412
Scorpia! A little help?

139
00:08:18,915 --> 00:08:20,708
Hey, guys. Can't stay long.

140
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:24,378
I'm on a super important
top-secret mission for Catra.

141
00:08:24,462 --> 00:08:25,296
[chuckles]

142
00:08:27,048 --> 00:08:30,968
Good luck with that.
I'm sure Catra will be super grateful.

143
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:34,055
Uh, yeah. Of course she'll be grateful.

144
00:08:34,138 --> 00:08:36,432
Everything Catra's done
has been to help the Horde.

145
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:39,936
And if we stick with her,
keep doing our jobs, I know she'll notice.

146
00:08:40,478 --> 00:08:41,896
You know, eventually.

147
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:43,356
Yeah, right.

148
00:08:43,731 --> 00:08:47,235
Our guys are getting attacked
on the Northern Perimeter,

149
00:08:47,318 --> 00:08:49,153
and Catra's letting it happen.

150
00:08:49,237 --> 00:08:51,489
She doesn't care about any of us.

151
00:08:52,615 --> 00:08:54,283
No. No, you're wrong.

152
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:58,454
Catra's under a lot of pressure,
and maybe she just...

153
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:00,540
When are you gonna wake up?

154
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:05,836
Hey! We were supposed
to be loading these onto the transport.

155
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:10,841
Scorpia... Ugh. Just get out of here.
We've got real work to do.

156
00:09:11,342 --> 00:09:14,178
Good idea.
You do your job, I'll go do mine.

157
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:16,847
Just a well-oiled machine.

158
00:09:19,433 --> 00:09:21,602
[Bow] I don't see defensive bots here.

159
00:09:21,686 --> 00:09:24,355
It doesn't look like
there's anyone on watch.

160
00:09:24,438 --> 00:09:27,567
But we don't know what they've got
inside the outpost.

161
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:30,778
Let's go in nice and slow.
Here's what we're gonna do.

162
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:32,196
Glimmer!

163
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,698
[shouting and grunting]

164
00:09:37,785 --> 00:09:39,662
Glimmer, what are you doing?

165
00:09:39,996 --> 00:09:42,415
You can't just rush into battle
on your own like that.

166
00:09:42,498 --> 00:09:44,750
You're the queen. You're too valuable.

167
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:49,380
Am I the queen? Because it seems like
you're the one giving all the orders.

168
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:53,551
-And what's your plan? More dark magic?
-It's not dark magic!

169
00:09:53,634 --> 00:09:58,180
And I don't know. Ugh, maybe,
if it helps me do what needs to be done.

170
00:09:58,389 --> 00:10:01,434
-Magic won't fix everything, you know.
-What good is magic if--?

171
00:10:01,517 --> 00:10:04,604
Double Trouble, sometimes you're too good.

172
00:10:04,687 --> 00:10:08,399
-[She-Ra] ...you have us for.
-I don't need you guys to save me.

173
00:10:08,482 --> 00:10:12,236
Stop treating me like I'm weak
and let me make my own decisions!

174
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,322
We're just looking out for you!

175
00:10:14,405 --> 00:10:16,407
Hey, what's going on with you two?

176
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:17,408
-Nothing!
-Nothing!

177
00:10:17,491 --> 00:10:19,035
Okay, we're talking this out.

178
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:21,871
Adora, is there something
you need to say to Glimmer?

179
00:10:21,954 --> 00:10:23,372
No. I don't know.

180
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:24,624
What? It's fine.

181
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:26,125
Come on, you can do it.

182
00:10:26,584 --> 00:10:29,253
Communication is the key
to a good friendship.

183
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:31,631
I don't know why Glimmer is suddenly okay

184
00:10:31,714 --> 00:10:34,508
with trusting Shadow Weaver
after everything she's done to us.

185
00:10:34,592 --> 00:10:38,012
I'm just-- I'm worried about her.
It's too dangerous.

186
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:41,182
You really think
I'm naive enough to trust her?

187
00:10:41,682 --> 00:10:45,519
Glimmer, would you try phrasing that
a little more constructively?

188
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:46,479
[sighs]

189
00:10:46,562 --> 00:10:51,317
Everything I'm doing is to protect people,
is to protect you.

190
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:57,573
I'm not asking you to trust Shadow Weaver,
but can't you at least trust me?

191
00:10:58,574 --> 00:10:59,659
[grunting]

192
00:11:00,576 --> 00:11:04,121
-Of course, I trust you, Glimmer.
-There you go.

193
00:11:04,205 --> 00:11:06,624
That's how the Best Friend Squad does it.

194
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:09,919
Ugh. I have to do everything around here.

195
00:11:14,882 --> 00:11:16,509
[both shouting]

196
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:20,638
Help! Help!

197
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:23,849
-She-Ra, help!
-Flutterina!

198
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:25,351
Help! Help!

199
00:11:25,434 --> 00:11:27,103
Put me down!

200
00:11:29,105 --> 00:11:31,565
I'm on your side. Now, follow my lead.

201
00:11:31,732 --> 00:11:33,526
[clearing throat] Help!

202
00:11:33,609 --> 00:11:34,735
[groaning]

203
00:11:39,448 --> 00:11:40,282
Anything yet?

204
00:11:43,744 --> 00:11:47,581
I know we've looked everywhere,
but it's got to be here somewhere.

205
00:11:50,418 --> 00:11:54,004
Super Pal Trio.
Man, those were good times, huh?

206
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,299
Focus! Scorpia, you can't let Catra down.

207
00:11:57,758 --> 00:12:01,178
Think like Entrapta. Think like Entrapta.

208
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:02,555
[groans]

209
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:04,181
[as Entrapta] Bots!

210
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:06,058
Hordak.

211
00:12:08,185 --> 00:12:09,520
Tiny food.

212
00:12:10,062 --> 00:12:13,357
Uh, First Ones tech. Runestones.

213
00:12:13,441 --> 00:12:15,609
[in normal voice]
The Black Garnet Chamber!

214
00:12:21,323 --> 00:12:24,326
[groans] Yeah, this place
also gives me the creeps.

215
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:26,454
But some of Entrapta's stuff
is still in here,

216
00:12:26,537 --> 00:12:28,622
so, the recordings might be, too.

217
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:30,749
[laughs] Wow.

218
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:32,751
So many good times in here, huh?

219
00:12:32,835 --> 00:12:34,753
That time Entrapta hacked
the Black Garnet.

220
00:12:34,837 --> 00:12:38,340
That time Shadow Weaver tried to kill us.
And before that...

221
00:12:41,469 --> 00:12:45,473
You're not gonna believe this, Emily,
but I'm actually a Princess.

222
00:12:46,849 --> 00:12:49,393
I know, right? That's what they all say.

223
00:12:49,477 --> 00:12:52,980
[laughs] It's ridiculous, I know,
but it's true.

224
00:12:53,397 --> 00:12:55,524
The Fright Zone
used to be my family's kingdom.

225
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:59,570
But then Hordak showed up,
and, well, you know, the rest is history.

226
00:13:00,362 --> 00:13:02,990
It's not like the Black Garnet
ever worked for me anyway.

227
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:07,119
[whooshing noise]

228
00:13:16,504 --> 00:13:18,214
Ah, it's for the best.

229
00:13:18,589 --> 00:13:21,550
I mean, can you imagine? Me, a princess?

230
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:26,680
I just need to find those recordings,
and then--

231
00:13:29,016 --> 00:13:32,019
<i>Commencing experiment number 703.</i>
<i>Ready, Emily?</i>

232
00:13:32,102 --> 00:13:32,937
Entrapta?

233
00:13:33,395 --> 00:13:34,897
[laughing]

234
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:35,940
<i>Success!</i>

235
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:39,443
<i>In addition to uploading back-ups</i>
<i>of my logs into Emily's hard drive,</i>

236
00:13:39,527 --> 00:13:43,697
<i>I've upgraded her to record visual data.</i>
<i>Hi!</i>

237
00:13:43,781 --> 00:13:47,368
<i>Now when an experiment blows up</i>
<i>and I lose all memory of that day,</i>

238
00:13:47,451 --> 00:13:50,287
<i>I'll still have record of the research.</i>

239
00:13:50,829 --> 00:13:52,122
<i>Everyone smile!</i>

240
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:55,417
<i>I told you to be ready to leave.</i>
<i>Have you even started packing?</i>

241
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:57,336
<i>I'm a scientist.</i>

242
00:13:57,419 --> 00:14:00,839
<i>The only thing I'll need</i>
<i>in the Northern Reach is my mind!</i>

243
00:14:01,423 --> 00:14:02,675
<i>Also my giant drill.</i>

244
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:05,886
<i>Also... everything in this room.</i>

245
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:07,888
<i>Super Pal Trio field trip!</i>

246
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:09,348
<i>I can't wait.</i>

247
00:14:09,431 --> 00:14:12,101
<i>We can watch the snow fall,</i>
<i>drink hot cocoa...</i>

248
00:14:12,184 --> 00:14:14,436
[Entrapta] <i>Can the hot cocoas be tiny?</i>

249
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:15,396
[Catra groans]

250
00:14:15,479 --> 00:14:19,108
<i>We're there to dig up First Ones tech.</i>
<i>We're not making cocoa.</i>

251
00:14:19,483 --> 00:14:22,069
<i>That's my wildcat, always on goal.</i>

252
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:24,905
<i>What do you think</i>
<i>is buried out there, anyway?</i>

253
00:14:24,989 --> 00:14:27,825
<i>Oh... Something big.</i>

254
00:14:28,158 --> 00:14:30,703
<i>Who cares?</i>
<i>Pack your stuff and let's go already.</i>

255
00:14:30,786 --> 00:14:33,372
<i>I'll bring the cocoa</i>
<i>if you bring the tiny mugs.</i>

256
00:14:33,455 --> 00:14:34,373
<i>It's a date.</i>

257
00:14:34,456 --> 00:14:35,499
[giggling]

258
00:14:35,624 --> 00:14:36,458
<i>Yeah!</i>

259
00:14:39,962 --> 00:14:42,631
I miss her.

260
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:47,303
Wait, Entrapta's recordings?
She stored them inside you?

261
00:14:48,178 --> 00:14:50,723
We did it, you beautiful bot!
We found them!

262
00:14:50,806 --> 00:14:54,810
We've got to go tell Catra that--
Well, can't you just take them out?

263
00:14:55,102 --> 00:14:56,103
Not possible?

264
00:14:57,479 --> 00:14:59,440
They're deeply ingrained in your processor

265
00:14:59,523 --> 00:15:02,484
and can't be accessed
without dismantling you?

266
00:15:04,194 --> 00:15:07,865
Catra needs these recordings,
and I wanna be there for her.

267
00:15:07,948 --> 00:15:10,075
I'm loyal, that's my whole thing.

268
00:15:11,118 --> 00:15:12,912
I'm sure it'll be fine.

269
00:15:13,287 --> 00:15:17,917
She wouldn't hurt you. She wouldn't.
Even though the recordings are inside you,

270
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,338
and she's kind of said the words
"scrap metal" and "Emily" together a lot.

271
00:15:23,881 --> 00:15:27,676
Come on, I know a great place to hide.
I mean, think, not hide.

272
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,304
We're not hiding.
We're thinking, that's it.

273
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:37,269
[shouting]

274
00:15:37,353 --> 00:15:41,607
-Bow, can you take them out?
-I can't risk hitting Flutterina.

275
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:44,652
Come on, work with me here.

276
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:48,572
[man] Drop your weapons
or the girl gets it.

277
00:15:49,156 --> 00:15:50,491
Ugh, it'll do.

278
00:15:50,574 --> 00:15:53,953
Let her go, now,
or it's not gonna be pretty.

279
00:15:54,036 --> 00:15:58,207
-Glimmer, no. They could hurt Flutterina.
-Someone has to do something.

280
00:15:58,290 --> 00:15:59,458
[grunts]

281
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:01,585
[both shouting]

282
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:13,722
Why isn't anyone guarding these outposts?
Where is everyone?

283
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:15,015
[man] I don't know.

284
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:20,479
I haven't practiced this one as much.
I'm still getting the hang of it.

285
00:16:20,562 --> 00:16:22,564
It's a truth spell if it works.

286
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:27,403
But if it fails,
it can be extremely painful.

287
00:16:28,237 --> 00:16:32,074
[man] Okay, okay! Catra called back
our bots and most of our team.

288
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:33,826
I don't know why, I swear.

289
00:16:34,952 --> 00:16:38,122
-I don't, I really don't!
-I think you do.

290
00:16:38,789 --> 00:16:39,915
Glimmer, stop!

291
00:16:41,709 --> 00:16:44,294
Catra pulled her forces
from the Northern Perimeter.

292
00:16:44,378 --> 00:16:49,174
We've been wasting our time all day.
And this guy is wasting mine.

293
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:52,845
Bow, put him back
with the others and let's go.

294
00:16:52,928 --> 00:16:56,640
Glimmer, what are you doing?
You took things way too far.

295
00:16:57,099 --> 00:16:59,852
I wasn't going to hurt him.
Did you think I would really--?

296
00:16:59,935 --> 00:17:02,938
Look, maybe we should get some rest,
and talk about this when--

297
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:06,525
The Kingdom of Snows' supply line is open.
We're done here.

298
00:17:06,608 --> 00:17:07,443
Fine by me.

299
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,740
And scene.

300
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:24,960
Welcome to Horror Hall. It was part
of the Royal Scorpion Family's kingdom,

301
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:27,296
but nobody comes here anymore. [chuckles]

302
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:31,175
I would sneak down here
to hide when I was a kid. Yeah.

303
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:36,180
Oh! Check out these guys! That's Pointy.
Over there is Captain Pointy.

304
00:17:36,263 --> 00:17:39,099
And this here is the widow,
Madame Pointessa.

305
00:17:39,767 --> 00:17:42,644
Okay, fine, I made those up.
I don't know their names. [laughs]

306
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:47,066
But this, this guy,
this is my granddad, the king.

307
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:49,443
He was the greatest.

308
00:17:49,526 --> 00:17:53,030
That's what the Horde told me, anyway.
I don't remember him. I was too young.

309
00:17:53,989 --> 00:17:56,450
I have Granddad to thank
for my opportunities in life.

310
00:17:56,742 --> 00:17:58,327
He made the alliance with Hordak.

311
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:03,040
As part of it, our kingdom gave up
our Runestone, and Princess.

312
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:07,628
My granddad must've known
I'd be happier as a soldier.

313
00:18:08,337 --> 00:18:10,923
And I made friends in the Horde, like you.

314
00:18:16,512 --> 00:18:17,387
Ah.

315
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:20,849
Okay, well, things didn't
exactly work out for my kingdom.

316
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:24,895
But Granddad stayed loyal to the end.
That's what scorpions do best.

317
00:18:24,978 --> 00:18:28,148
Brave, loyal, great hugs.

318
00:18:31,819 --> 00:18:34,947
I need to be there for Catra.
I'll just tell her about the recordings.

319
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:38,742
She is my friend, and she will
not hurt you if I ask her not to.

320
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:44,164
[Catra] <i>I don't care what it takes.</i>
<i>We are opening that portal now!</i>

321
00:18:44,248 --> 00:18:45,916
<i>No! I won't!</i>

322
00:18:45,999 --> 00:18:48,502
<i>I need to tell Hordak. He'll understand.</i>

323
00:18:48,585 --> 00:18:49,878
[Entrapta shouting]

324
00:18:51,713 --> 00:18:53,632
[Catra] <i>Get her out of here! I don't care!</i>

325
00:18:53,715 --> 00:18:57,469
-She was threatened. She didn't mean it.
<i>-Put her on the transport to Beast Island.</i>

326
00:18:57,553 --> 00:18:59,888
[Scorpia] <i>Beast Island? You can't!</i>

327
00:19:00,889 --> 00:19:02,224
<i>You wanna be next?</i>

328
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:03,559
[gasps]

329
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:08,856
Catra betrayed her.

330
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:13,193
She betrayed me
and I just let her take Entrapta away.

331
00:19:14,695 --> 00:19:18,198
Catra doesn't care.
She'll hurt people to get her way.

332
00:19:18,574 --> 00:19:20,951
If she knew the recordings
were inside of you...

333
00:19:22,077 --> 00:19:25,205
But I still have time.
I can still be a good friend.

334
00:19:28,292 --> 00:19:29,459
[grunting]

335
00:19:30,752 --> 00:19:32,296
You better have something for me.

336
00:19:33,338 --> 00:19:36,842
Entrapta's recordings.
She stored them all in Emily.

337
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:44,892
The chip got damaged when I extracted it,
but hopefully that won't matter.

338
00:19:44,975 --> 00:19:47,352
It was just so small
and, you know, pincers.

339
00:19:47,436 --> 00:19:51,607
-You broke the recordings?
-I didn't mean to.

340
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:53,400
I asked you to do one thing.

341
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:56,612
One simple thing
and you completely ruined it!

342
00:19:56,695 --> 00:20:00,490
But of course you ruined it. Yeah.
You're Scorpia. That's just what you do.

343
00:20:00,574 --> 00:20:03,202
You couldn't handle Emily,
you never know when to shut up.

344
00:20:03,285 --> 00:20:06,163
The only thing you've ever done
is get in my way!

345
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:07,706
What did I expect?

346
00:20:07,789 --> 00:20:11,043
I mean, how can you possibly
be this useless?

347
00:20:13,086 --> 00:20:14,379
What?

348
00:20:15,589 --> 00:20:16,798
You're a bad friend.

349
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:34,316
The recordings?

350
00:20:37,486 --> 00:20:41,281
Entrapta must have taken them
with her before leaving. There's nothing.

351
00:20:42,616 --> 00:20:43,617
[shouts]

352
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:49,998
I gave you an order.

353
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:54,002
Get over it.

354
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:58,507
You don't need Entrapta. You never did.

355
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:01,551
You don't need a Princess in your life
telling you what to do.

356
00:21:01,635 --> 00:21:06,807
Look at what you've done without her.
You built an army. An empire.

357
00:21:08,642 --> 00:21:11,186
You and me, we don't need anyone.

358
00:21:11,478 --> 00:21:15,857
Forget them all. No one matters,
nothing matters but this mission.

359
00:21:18,443 --> 00:21:22,155
You want to prove yourself,
prove your worth? Then do it.

360
00:21:22,239 --> 00:21:26,618
You and I are going to conquer Etheria.
And then, they'll all see.

361
00:21:39,172 --> 00:21:40,465
Of course.

362
00:21:41,883 --> 00:21:47,639
Yes. We will prevail.
Give me another day, and I will be ready.

363
00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:51,560
Does that mean I can give the command?

364
00:21:51,643 --> 00:21:54,313
It is time.

365
00:22:11,496 --> 00:22:12,789
Okay, I bought us some time.

366
00:22:12,873 --> 00:22:16,126
Catra didn't know that was just old junk
or that I was lying to her.

367
00:22:17,377 --> 00:22:21,590
There's nothing I can do for her,
but maybe I can still help Entrapta.

368
00:22:26,678 --> 00:22:28,930
Ready for a Super Pal Duo field trip?

369
00:22:29,473 --> 00:22:32,225
We're getting out of here, Emily,
for good.

370
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:44,112
