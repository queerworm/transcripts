Any clue where the server room is yet?

179
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:12,653
Forgive me, brother.

180
00:10:12,778 --> 00:10:15,865
The ship is designed
so that it may only be navigated

181
00:10:15,948 --> 00:10:18,784
by one who has access to the hive-mind.

182
00:10:19,827 --> 00:10:22,663
And I have been cut off.

183
00:10:22,747 --> 00:10:25,625
There's something in here,
a big energy signal.

184
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:26,834
This has to be it.

Adora?

189
00:10:41,557 --> 00:10:42,600
What did you do to her?

190
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:48,230
I have made her anew.

191
00:10:48,773 --> 00:10:50,274
I saw her mind,

192
00:10:50,608 --> 00:10:54,654
so ensnared in rage, and grief, and pain,

193
00:10:55,237 --> 00:10:57,657
and I brought her to the light.

194
00:10:58,407 --> 00:11:00,910
Isn't that right, little sister?

195
00:11:01,786 --> 00:11:03,704
Catra, you have to fight it.

196
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,207
My place is with Horde Prime, Adora.

197
00:11:06,457 --> 00:11:07,458
I don't want to leave.

198
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:09,835
Tell her what I've done for you.

199
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:12,213
Prime has given me peace.

200
00:11:12,713 --> 00:11:14,090
Something you could never do.

201
00:11:15,132 --> 00:11:16,342
You broke my heart.

202
00:11:16,592 --> 00:11:18,427
But he has made it whole again.

203
00:11:18,844 --> 00:11:20,971
Don't you see? This is for the best.

204

I'm happy here.

205
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:24,141
You could be happy, too.

206
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:27,937

209
00:11:32,316 --> 00:11:35,236
I will give her to you, if you want her.

210
00:11:36,862 --> 00:11:40,491
But first, you must do something for me.

211
00:11:41,158 --> 00:11:43,911
You will give me She-Ra.

212
00:11:44,912 --> 00:11:45,746
Never.

213
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:47,665

You thought yourself worthy
to challenge me,

221

but you are nothing but a false hero,

222
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:20,239

Bring out She-Ra and strike me down.

Ah... But you two
must have a lot of catching up to do.

228

Prime has set me free of that pain.

265

It's like a neural network,

in a three-dimensional configuration.
