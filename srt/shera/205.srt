1
00:00:28,862 --> 00:00:31,197
Hi, Catra. Did you have a nice nap?

2
00:00:31,281 --> 00:00:36,327
[groans] Why is this taking so long? You
said there was a First Ones weapon here.

3
00:00:36,411 --> 00:00:37,412
Where is it?

4
00:00:37,495 --> 00:00:38,830
I never said "weapon."

5
00:00:38,913 --> 00:00:42,292
I said there's a piece of First Ones tech
buried deep under the ice,

6
00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:44,461
and a really powerful one at that.

7
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:47,756
The energy levels, it must be part of
the First Ones' supercomputer.

8
00:00:47,839 --> 00:00:49,215
Just keep digging.

9
00:00:49,299 --> 00:00:52,051
Hordak is not going to be happy
if we waste his time

10
00:00:52,135 --> 00:00:53,928
and come back empty-handed.

11
00:00:54,012 --> 00:00:57,682
A scientist never returns empty-handed.

12
00:00:57,766 --> 00:00:59,434
There's always data.

13
00:00:59,517 --> 00:01:02,520
I'm not here freezing my tail off
for data.

14
00:01:02,604 --> 00:01:05,398
Find me something useful
or we're packing up and heading home.

15
00:01:05,648 --> 00:01:07,067
This place gives me the creeps.

16
00:01:13,031 --> 00:01:14,240

{\an8}The Dragon's Daughter Five. She cuts
a fine line on the sea, does she not?

28
00:01:56,783 --> 00:01:59,577
{\an8}Wait. What happened
to the Dragon's Daughter Four?

29
00:01:59,661 --> 00:02:03,373
{\an8}Oh, oh, oh, was it adventure?

30
00:02:03,456 --> 00:02:06,793
{\an8}No. Termites.
I couldn't save the old girl.

31
00:02:07,085 --> 00:02:11,214
{\an8}Anyway, I'm honored to be a part of
another daring mission for the Rebellion.

32
00:02:11,297 --> 00:02:14,968
{\an8}Well, you know, we needed a boat
to get up here, and you have a boat.

33
00:02:15,051 --> 00:02:19,681
Yes, I do. Heh. Truth be told,
I was glad to have something to do.

34
00:02:19,764 --> 00:02:23,226
Mermista canceled our plans this week,
and she's hanging out with her friends

35
00:02:23,309 --> 00:02:25,436
and didn't invite me to join. I...

36
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,523
Well, let this mission
distract you from all that.

37
00:02:28,857 --> 00:02:30,942
We've received reports of Horde activity

38
00:02:31,025 --> 00:02:35,488
in the Northern Reach. They've set up some
kind of outpost, but we have no idea why.

39
00:02:35,572 --> 00:02:39,909
The Northern Reach is nothing but snow and
ice. What could they possibly be doing?

40
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:42,120
I don't know, but it can't be good.

41
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:48,042
[Catra grunting]

42
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:52,255
Okay, Scorpia, get your head in the game.
You've got this.

43
00:02:52,797 --> 00:02:54,799
You and Catra have a special bond,

44
00:02:54,883 --> 00:02:57,385
and deep down in her heart,
she knows that.

45
00:02:58,553 --> 00:02:59,470
[sighs]

46
00:03:01,556 --> 00:03:04,559
-Scorpia, good. You're here.
-Yes, I am.

47
00:03:04,642 --> 00:03:07,186
Entrapta brought all this junk
from her lab.

48
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:11,274
Help me find a space heater or something
since apparently we live here now.

49
00:03:11,357 --> 00:03:16,487
So, I've been thinking,
and I know you've been really busy

50
00:03:16,571 --> 00:03:21,910
and focused on your career lately,
but would you ever want to...

51
00:03:21,993 --> 00:03:25,914
you know, like, hang out sometime with me?

52
00:03:25,997 --> 00:03:28,750
What are you talking about?
We are hanging out. Right now.

53
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:31,252
Yes, totally, totes.

54
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:36,382
But, uh, what I meant was, like, outside
of office hours. You know, we could, pfft,

55
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:42,555
I don't know, um, play a board game or do
some other type of bonding activity.

56
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:43,765
[laughs, then shouts]

57
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:56,236
[shouts] Careful with that.
It's a rare First Ones artifact.

58
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:59,113
I've been meaning to study it
but haven't gotten a chance.

59
00:03:59,197 --> 00:04:02,200
The last time I deployed it,
it ended up infecting all of my robots

60
00:04:02,283 --> 00:04:04,410
with some kind of murder-virus.

61
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:08,748
You brought along a murder-virus
and not a blanket?

62
00:04:08,831 --> 00:04:10,291
It does other things, too.

63
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:13,544
For example, when it infected She-Ra, she
lost her powers.

64
00:04:13,628 --> 00:04:16,422
Also, she got very floppy.

65
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:20,385
A She-Ra off-switch, huh? Why didn't
you say something sooner?

66
00:04:20,468 --> 00:04:24,055
So, anyway,
in non-She-Ra business, [chuckles]

67
00:04:24,138 --> 00:04:26,057
when I said we could do something--

68
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:27,392
-[alarm wailing]
-[gasps]

69
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:30,395
-[Entrapta] Uh-oh.
-What?

70
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:33,773
[chuckles] It's just a small bump.
I'm sure its fine.

71
00:04:33,856 --> 00:04:36,276
But our drilling bots have gone offline.

72
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:38,152
All of them. At once.

73
00:04:39,153 --> 00:04:42,991
-Come on. We should go check this out.
-[groans] I hate this place.

74
00:04:46,828 --> 00:04:49,414
[Sea Hawk] Come to think of it,
Mermista never invites me

75
00:04:49,497 --> 00:04:51,457
to hang out with her other friends.

76
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:56,129
I mean, heh, am I not cool enough
for them?

77
00:04:56,212 --> 00:04:58,464
I'm so cool. I'm Sea Hawk.

78
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:05,680
[grunts]

79
00:05:07,056 --> 00:05:09,100
What's wrong? Did you see something?

80
00:05:09,183 --> 00:05:12,020
No. I think there's something else
out here.

81
00:05:12,103 --> 00:05:16,774
You know, they say all sorts of strange
things happen in the Northern Reach.

82
00:05:16,858 --> 00:05:20,611
Voices on the wind. Monsters in the snow.

83
00:05:20,695 --> 00:05:22,530
Machines break down.

84
00:05:22,613 --> 00:05:26,826
Sailors disappear without a trace.
We could be next!

85
00:05:27,952 --> 00:05:30,288
I am cool, right? I am. Right?

86
00:05:31,205 --> 00:05:33,333
[sighs] My tracker pad's been on the fritz

87
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:36,335
ever since that rogue communications hub
messed with it.

88
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:38,880
I'm having trouble pinpointing
the Horde's location.

89
00:05:38,963 --> 00:05:42,467
Worry not. We'll follow our instincts!

90
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:43,676
This way!

91
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:49,640
Or there's this new signal. It's big.
It looks like a First Ones tech signature.

92
00:05:49,724 --> 00:05:51,601
That's where the Horde will be.

93
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:53,644
Hmm. Hmm, hmm.

94
00:05:55,396 --> 00:05:59,984
[echoing] Ah. Here we go.
Well, the drilling bots are gone.

95
00:06:03,112 --> 00:06:05,907
What? They just disappeared into thin air?

96
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:08,493
Maybe there's scientific truth
to the rumors

97
00:06:08,576 --> 00:06:10,745
about strange happenings in this region.

98
00:06:10,828 --> 00:06:13,122
We weren't sent here to chase rumors.

99
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:15,792
Hordak wants tech.
If your bots can't dig it out,

100
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:18,461
-then maybe I'll send you down there to--
-[She-Ra] Catra.

101
00:06:21,672 --> 00:06:23,174
It's been a while.

102
00:06:24,675 --> 00:06:28,096
-Hey, Adora.
-You're pretty far from the front line.

103
00:06:28,179 --> 00:06:31,557
I guess Shadow Weaver's keeping you
away from the action since you lost

104
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:33,184
the battle of Bright Moon.

105
00:06:33,267 --> 00:06:37,939
Shadow Weaver? Wow.
I always forget how clueless you are.

106
00:06:38,022 --> 00:06:42,860
We're here to take back this land. Time
for you to go back to the Fright Zone.

107
00:06:42,944 --> 00:06:46,197
-You want us to go? Try and make us.
-My pleasure.

108
00:06:46,906 --> 00:06:48,116
[grunting]

109
00:06:51,285 --> 00:06:55,289
-Adventure!
-This is not how this was supposed to go.

110
00:06:55,623 --> 00:06:57,041
[grunting and shouting]

111
00:07:16,227 --> 00:07:19,897
Hey, while we're here, would you describe
me as "cool"? Be honest now.

112
00:07:20,773 --> 00:07:21,732
Potentially.

113
00:07:23,901 --> 00:07:27,572
Entrapta, whatever you're doing here
has to stop!

114
00:07:27,655 --> 00:07:30,158
You don't understand
the forces you're messing with!

115
00:07:30,241 --> 00:07:32,410
I know! That's the fun of it!

116
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:49,469
-Don't move.
-Oh, please. You'd never have the guts.

117
00:07:51,721 --> 00:07:56,225
You know, as much as I love our fights,
it's way too cold for this.

118
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:58,728
Why don't we try something new?

119
00:07:59,645 --> 00:08:00,563
[screaming]

120
00:08:05,526 --> 00:08:07,487
Catra, what did you do?

121
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:17,121
-You said she'd be powerless.
-She will be.

122
00:08:17,205 --> 00:08:21,209
-Eventually. I think.
-Actually, this is pretty cool.

123
00:08:21,292 --> 00:08:25,379
I know you're still in there, Adora.
You've got to snap out of it.

124
00:08:25,671 --> 00:08:26,923
Let go of the sword.

125
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:29,342
You're gonna be okay, promise.

126
00:08:30,259 --> 00:08:31,928
[grunting]

127
00:08:32,011 --> 00:08:33,095
Glimmer!

128
00:08:36,557 --> 00:08:37,725
What is happening?

129
00:08:50,112 --> 00:08:51,030
[all shouting]

130
00:08:55,993 --> 00:08:59,956
This is the greatest thing
that's ever happened.

131
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,375
[grunting and shouting]

132
00:09:19,183 --> 00:09:20,685
[laughing]

133
00:09:20,768 --> 00:09:22,019
Adora, wait.

134
00:09:22,103 --> 00:09:24,355
[Scorpia] Stay away from her.

135
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:36,784
Oh, I get it now. The sword got infected,
not Adora herself.

136
00:09:36,867 --> 00:09:39,787
Huh. I guess she really is organic matter.

137
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:41,956
Catra, are you okay?

138
00:09:42,039 --> 00:09:43,874
[laughing]

139
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:48,212
That went so much better
than I could've ever hoped.

140
00:09:48,296 --> 00:09:53,217
Looks like you're mine now, Adora.
Come on, get her inside.

141
00:09:59,015 --> 00:10:00,349
Is everyone okay?

142
00:10:01,892 --> 00:10:03,394
[Sea Hawk shouts]

143
00:10:03,686 --> 00:10:08,983
Well, I for one am shocked and terrified.
What happened up there?

144
00:10:09,525 --> 00:10:12,862
It's Entrapta's disc.
It infected She-Ra once before.

145
00:10:12,945 --> 00:10:15,865
We've got to get to Catra and destroy it
for good.

146
00:10:15,948 --> 00:10:20,536
Okay, let's go, Glimmer.
Teleport us up there. Adventure!

147
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:24,373
[groans] I can't.
I exhausted my magic in the fight.

148
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:27,084
Until I can recharge, we're climbing.

149
00:10:27,168 --> 00:10:28,628
That's terribly inconvenient.

150
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:31,047
Shouldn't you keep better count
or something?

151
00:10:31,505 --> 00:10:32,381
[Glimmer groans]

152
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:37,637
[Glimmer] I hope Catra survives She-Ra so
I can wipe that smirk off her face myself.

153
00:10:38,554 --> 00:10:42,266
Always so perfect. Look at you now.

154
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:45,686
You're coming back to the Horde
under my command.

155
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:47,813
So we're, uh, keeping her?

156
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:49,106
You saw her out there.

157
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:52,818
As long as we have this sword,
we have the power to make her go berserk.

158
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:56,989
We can turn the Rebellion's own hero
against them. That's good.

159
00:10:57,073 --> 00:11:01,452
I wonder which of your friends
I'll have you annihilate first.

160
00:11:01,535 --> 00:11:02,912
[chuckling]

161
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:05,373
[laughing]

162
00:11:06,624 --> 00:11:09,919
It looks like the bots pinpointed
the location of the First Ones' tech

163
00:11:10,002 --> 00:11:12,922
before they disappeared.
If you just give me a little more time.

164
00:11:13,005 --> 00:11:15,216
Ugh. Hey. This dumb mission is over.

165
00:11:15,299 --> 00:11:18,594
We have what we need right here,
the ultimate weapon.

166
00:11:18,677 --> 00:11:21,138
Pack up.
We're taking her back to the Fright Zone.

00:11:21,222 --> 00:11:24,850
-But Hordak wanted us to--
-Oh, wanted us to dig a useless hole?

168
00:11:24,934 --> 00:11:27,103
Forget it. I'm bringing She-Ra back.

[alarm wailing]

170
00:11:29,647 --> 00:11:32,441
I'll go. It's probably
just more Rebel idiots.

00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:35,111
-Scorpia, keep an eye on Adora.
-Oh, yeah. Yeah.

172
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:38,364
I will absolutely look after
this sleeping, non-moving person.

173
00:11:39,448 --> 00:11:40,699
Uh...

174
00:11:41,742 --> 00:11:43,119
[Entrapta] She went that way.

175
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:47,623
[Sea Hawk] I'm a pirate!
Pirates are the definition of cool.

176
00:11:47,706 --> 00:11:50,876
Although, you would think
I'd get invited to more parties.

177
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:53,129
I mean, you think I'm cool, right?

Now, come on, I'm taking you to the lab.

Don't. Don't. Stop.

Why are you making this
so much harder for me?

197

Please. Please. I'm a woman on the edge.

How did you do that?

201
00:13:11,373 --> 00:13:14,251
I put in Catra's favorite number.
[chuckles]

202
00:13:14,877 --> 00:13:20,382
[groans] I get it. You know
Catra's favorite number, and I don't.

Any sign of She-Ra? Preferably the
version that won't throw us off a cliff?

211
00:13:55,584 --> 00:13:58,254
No. No She-Ra.

212
00:13:58,337 --> 00:14:00,756

[groans] Can't believe I'm stuck
in a closet here with you.

217
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:12,977
I should be by Catra's side,
protecting her.

00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:15,104
Why can't you just stay out of our way?

-Is she all right?
-I don't know.

She is getting on my last nerve.
And she's not going anywhere.

00:14:41,338 --> 00:14:43,674
We'll see about that. En garde.

What's happening?
Why is the power going out?

237
00:15:11,452 --> 00:15:14,038
By drilling into the ice,
we've unleashed these creatures.

238
00:15:14,121 --> 00:15:17,958
Now they're obsessively trying to
destroy us. What an unexpected twist!

239
00:15:20,377 --> 00:15:22,963
Where did these things come from?

240
00:15:23,047 --> 00:15:26,508
I'm guessing it's something to do
with that giant pit Entrapta dug.

241
00:15:30,346 --> 00:15:33,807
Bow, their eyes,
they're red like She-Ra's.

infected, too? Ugh! Catra is the worst!

Ow.

248
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:01,001
Fascinating.

249
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:04,004
Hand her over.

250
00:16:04,421 --> 00:16:08,634
Let go! Catra entrusted me
with watching her. I can't let her down.

251
00:16:09,093 --> 00:16:12,554
Catra. [chuckles] She's mean.

252
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:17,184
She's misunderstood!
You of all people should know that.

253
00:16:17,267 --> 00:16:21,021
I mean, you grew up together.
I can't compete with that.

254
00:16:21,105 --> 00:16:24,692
No matter what I do,
I can't seem to break down her walls.

255
00:16:25,442 --> 00:16:29,697
But you two, even when you're trying
to kill each other,

256
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:33,242
you can tell there's a real bond.
I just...

257
00:16:33,575 --> 00:16:36,537
I wish she would see me
as worth her time, too.

258
00:16:39,623 --> 00:16:42,710
I-- I know how you feel.

259
00:16:44,586 --> 00:16:47,464
Always great to see you, Sparkles,
but we're a little busy here.

260
00:16:47,548 --> 00:16:49,216
Where's the disc, Catra?

261
00:16:49,299 --> 00:16:52,219
What? You didn't like my new,
improved version of She-Ra?

262
00:16:52,302 --> 00:16:55,556
Entrapta, please,
look who you're working with.

263
00:16:55,639 --> 00:16:59,309
Whatever the Horde is giving you,
it's not worth the damage you're doing.

264
00:16:59,393 --> 00:17:03,272
Those monsters outside are infected
by the same virus that's infecting She-Ra.

-[thud]
-[grunts]

266
00:17:05,149 --> 00:17:09,570
Infected? That can't be right. The disc
only infects First Ones tech. Unless...

267
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:13,407
[gasps] the bugs are First Ones tech.

269
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:20,497
I mean, just once I'd like to hang out
with Mermista and her friends.

270
00:17:20,581 --> 00:17:25,085
I'm good at groups.
I have excellent stories of derring-do.

271
00:17:25,169 --> 00:17:28,088
-Why don't they want me around?
-[Scorpia] I hear you.

272
00:17:28,172 --> 00:17:30,132
Catra's been so busy
since she got promoted.

273
00:17:30,215 --> 00:17:32,634
But she still always expects me
to make time for her.

274
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:35,012
Does she even understand
how much I do for her?

275
00:17:35,095 --> 00:17:39,433
Exactly. It seems like the only time
anyone wants to hang

276
00:17:39,516 --> 00:17:42,519
is when they need me give them a ride
or do something for them.

277
00:17:42,603 --> 00:17:44,104
Ugh. Tell me about it.

278
00:17:44,188 --> 00:17:48,692
Catra once used my rock hard exoskeleton
as a nail file. I even had to buff.

279
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:51,028
[laughing]

280
00:17:51,111 --> 00:17:52,613

281
00:17:56,658 --> 00:17:58,869
Is there something wrong with us?

282
00:18:00,245 --> 00:18:03,832
You know, you guys, you're really great.

283
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:06,293
You're just, like, the best.

284
00:18:06,376 --> 00:18:10,881
You're good friends and good people.

285
00:18:11,381 --> 00:18:13,717
And I like you.

286
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:17,137
You are so pointy.

287
00:18:17,221 --> 00:18:20,641
You know what?
She's right. We are really great.

288
00:18:20,724 --> 00:18:24,478
I'm clever, roguishly good-looking,
and a top-notch sailor.

289
00:18:24,561 --> 00:18:26,855
I don't care if anyone thinks I'm cool.

290
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:30,818
I don't need their opinions
to validate me. I'm Sea Hawk.

291
00:18:30,901 --> 00:18:35,739
And me, I am brave, strong,
give great hugs, and I'm loyal.

292
00:18:35,823 --> 00:18:39,493
You may have left Catra,
but someday she's gonna see that I won't.

293
00:18:39,576 --> 00:18:43,497
I'll always be there for her,
because that's who I am.

294
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:44,832
Yay!

295
00:18:44,915 --> 00:18:47,751
I'm also someone who's about
to kick some bug butt.

296
00:18:47,835 --> 00:18:51,004
Let's show them what we're made of.

297
00:18:51,088 --> 00:18:52,047
[rumbling]

298
00:18:52,172 --> 00:18:55,676
We have to destroy the disc,
or none of us are getting out.

299
00:18:55,759 --> 00:19:00,597
-Huh. Guess I must've lost it.
-Catra, it's in your pocket, remember?

00:19:09,857 --> 00:19:11,191
For the Horde!

304
00:19:11,275 --> 00:19:14,194
I don't agree with that sentiment,
but I'm also here.

305
00:19:14,278 --> 00:19:16,155
Pew-pew!

306
00:19:16,947 --> 00:19:19,575
Hey, I know you.

307
00:19:19,658 --> 00:19:22,202
Adora, I'm so glad you're okay.

308
00:19:26,957 --> 00:19:31,461
-Catra, are you all right?
-Just find the sword. I've got Adora.

00:19:51,773 --> 00:19:53,442
-No, you don't.
-Hi.

00:19:55,611 --> 00:19:56,862
En garde.

312
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:01,325
Just give us the disc!

313
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:06,205
Are you kidding? I've got control
of Adora. I am not giving that up.

314
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:07,789

317
00:20:25,933 --> 00:20:29,686
Catra, you have to destroy the disc.
It's the only way to stop them.

318
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:30,854
Catra!

319
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:41,782
Scorpia, you can end this.
You've got to break the disc now.

320
00:20:41,865 --> 00:20:44,201
Don't you dare.

321
00:20:44,743 --> 00:20:45,619
Uh...

322
00:20:45,953 --> 00:20:52,876
It seems to me that caring about someone
is the greatest adventure of them all.

323
00:20:54,836 --> 00:20:57,714
Sorry, wildcat. This is for your own good.

324
00:20:57,798 --> 00:20:59,132
No!

325
00:21:12,229 --> 00:21:14,648
-Oh. What happened?
-[Catra groaning]

326
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,989
Hey, put me down.

327
00:21:31,206 --> 00:21:32,249
[Catra sneezes]

328
00:21:33,583 --> 00:21:39,006
What're you so happy about? She-Ra won.
And we didn't get what we came for.

329
00:21:39,089 --> 00:21:43,302
The mission was a failure. How are we
going to explain this one to Hordak?

330
00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:46,930
Failure? This mission
was a resounding success.

331
00:21:47,514 --> 00:21:48,724
Ta-da!

332
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:50,976
I got the First Ones tech.

333
00:21:51,059 --> 00:21:53,562
What? When did you even--
How long have you had that?

334
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:56,982
A while. But we were having so much fun,
I didn't wanna say anything.

335
00:21:57,065 --> 00:21:58,734
Isn't it amazing?

336
00:21:58,817 --> 00:22:02,779
This puppy'll power Hordak's portal
technology and then some.

337
00:22:02,863 --> 00:22:04,031
[laughing]

338
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:06,908
Hordak is gonna be so thrilled.

339
00:22:12,664 --> 00:22:14,833
Hey. Thanks for getting us out.

340
00:22:15,459 --> 00:22:16,293
Anytime.

341
00:22:16,543 --> 00:22:17,627
[chattering]

342
00:22:17,878 --> 00:22:20,422
[groans] All right, come on.

343
00:22:20,797 --> 00:22:22,924
Really? Yes. Oh!

344
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:23,842
Thank you.

345
00:22:25,552 --> 00:22:27,345
Oh, gosh. Look at us.

346
00:22:27,721 --> 00:22:29,848
Just two peas in a pod.

347
00:22:29,931 --> 00:22:33,602
So when I brought it up before, I said
board games, but it doesn't have to be.

348
00:22:33,685 --> 00:22:35,312
We could do anything. I'm open.

349
00:22:35,395 --> 00:22:40,275
I like bowling. It's difficult for me
with my claws, but...

350
00:22:40,984 --> 00:22:42,986
