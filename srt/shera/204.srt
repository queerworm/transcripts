[gasps]

3
00:00:32,907 --> 00:00:34,242
{\an8}Ooh. Okay.

4
00:00:34,325 --> 00:00:38,204
{\an8}We need to reclaim the Horde-occupied
fortress for the Rebellion.

5
00:00:38,288 --> 00:00:42,709
{\an8}-How are we gonna do this?
-I'll teleport ahead to scout a path.

6
00:00:42,792 --> 00:00:45,920
{\an8}And I'll quietly shoot the turrets
with my trick arrows.

7
00:00:46,004 --> 00:00:48,840
You'll have the advantage
in a sneak attack. Go!

8
00:00:49,424 --> 00:00:50,341
[chirping]

00:00:52,135 --> 00:00:53,511

10
00:00:56,931 --> 00:00:58,558
[grunting and shouting]

11
00:01:01,603 --> 00:01:03,563
Yes! And now-- [grunts]

12
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:05,356
[both gasping]

13
00:01:07,525 --> 00:01:08,860
[crying]

14
00:01:10,361 --> 00:01:11,988
He's dead.

15
00:01:13,364 --> 00:01:15,200
[Bow] Oh, what?

16
00:01:15,283 --> 00:01:19,120
Tiny Bow, you will be avenged!

17
00:01:19,204 --> 00:01:21,456
[crying, then grunts]

18
00:01:22,749 --> 00:01:23,666
[groans]

19
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:26,544
That clearly isn't gonna work.
Let's try this again.

I shouldn't be dead.

30
00:02:03,873 --> 00:02:08,670
-That turret came out of nowhere.
-You failed to make an observation check.

31
00:02:08,753 --> 00:02:13,007
If we're gonna retake the pass,
we have to be prepared for anything.

32
00:02:13,091 --> 00:02:15,802
The pass is the only way
in or out of this region.

33
00:02:15,885 --> 00:02:19,222
The Horde seized it
while we were defending Bright Moon.

34
00:02:19,305 --> 00:02:23,393
-So it's crucial we get it back.
-Why does that mean I have to die?

35
00:02:23,476 --> 00:02:26,062
And after I made these for you!

36
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:30,191
Look. Our plans always fall apart. Always!

37
00:02:30,275 --> 00:02:34,404
-It'd be impressive if not terrifying.
-We've gotten good at improvising, though.

38
00:02:34,487 --> 00:02:35,530
[sighs]

39
00:02:35,613 --> 00:02:39,909
If we're gonna pull this off,
we need a plan that won't fall apart,

40
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:43,788
that takes into account everything
the Horde could throw at us,

41
00:02:43,872 --> 00:02:48,418
-including surprise attacks.
-But you're breaking Tiny Bow's heart.

42
00:02:49,085 --> 00:02:52,171
-I mean, look at his face.
-He's smiling.

43
00:02:52,255 --> 00:02:55,717
Through his pain, Glimmer.
Through his pain.

44
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:59,929
Guys, this pass is important. The Horde
won't give it up without a fight.

45
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:04,350
It's obviously gonna be guarded
by their very best and brightest.

46
00:03:04,434 --> 00:03:08,021
Move those big weapon-y things!
Flap those banners! Uh...

47
00:03:08,104 --> 00:03:10,815
Keep doing whatever it is you're doing,
guy I'm pointing at.

48
00:03:10,899 --> 00:03:14,944
Now do a different thing!
And look sharp, Force Captain's orders!

49
00:03:17,196 --> 00:03:20,033
Catra left me in charge.
Me. Can you believe it?

50
00:03:20,408 --> 00:03:23,494
-Uh, no. I really can't.
-Ah, me neither.

51
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:27,123
She must trust me. I can't let her down.

52
00:03:27,206 --> 00:03:31,294
-Kyle, man the parapets!
-I don't know what those are.

53
00:03:31,377 --> 00:03:32,837
[Scorpia] Then find out.

54
00:03:33,296 --> 00:03:34,964
[panting]

55
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:40,762
[groans] "Scorpia, you're in charge
of the fortress," she said.

56
00:03:40,845 --> 00:03:43,348
"Even you can't mess this up," she said.

57
00:03:43,431 --> 00:03:45,975
Even me. She's thinking about me.

58
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:49,812
Ah. Should I get her a thank-you gift?
What's her favorite color?

59
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:52,690
-Kyle, what are you doing?
-Uh, you said-- I--

60
00:03:52,774 --> 00:03:54,692
Go find out Catra's favorite color!

61
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,195
[panting]

62
00:03:59,697 --> 00:04:04,285
You guys know Catra. What would she like?
I need it to be something that says,

63
00:04:04,369 --> 00:04:08,706
"Thank you," but also, "We are soulmates
tied together by the threads of fate."

64
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:11,459
We should spend less time
talking about Catra,

65
00:04:11,542 --> 00:04:13,544
and more time checking the defenses.

66
00:04:17,715 --> 00:04:20,051
-The reason we're here!
-[laughs]

67
00:04:20,551 --> 00:04:23,429
Okay. You don't need to remind me.

68
00:04:23,513 --> 00:04:27,684
My wildcat is counting on me,
and I won't let her down.

69
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:31,938
For Catra, I will defend this pass
with my very life!

70
00:04:32,021 --> 00:04:33,481
[coughs] Wrong pass.

71
00:04:35,233 --> 00:04:39,237
Yes, this is the pass
I'll defend with my very life.

72
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,738
No reason to worry at all!

73
00:04:43,992 --> 00:04:45,827
Clearly that plan won't work.

74
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:49,956
So maybe if we try sneaking
past the turrets from a different side--

75
00:04:50,039 --> 00:04:52,417
[Glimmer] You're going about this wrong.

76
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:58,047
We're not going to win by sneaking.
We gotta take the action to them!

77
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:04,178
[chuckles] Just let Glimmer handle this.

78
00:05:04,762 --> 00:05:09,976
<i>Using my awesome powers of teleportation,</i>
<i>I take out their first line of defense.</i>

79
00:05:10,059 --> 00:05:11,602
[imitating explosion]

80
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:14,230
<i>Then I teleport onto the wall</i>

81
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:17,817
<i>and take out a line of soldiers</i>
<i>with one critical strike!</i>

82
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:19,902
[Glimmer imitating explosion]

83
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:24,490
I backflip, front flip,
backflip into a teleport, poof!

84
00:05:24,574 --> 00:05:28,286
Then I take out a Super Bot,
and it explodes!

85
00:05:29,287 --> 00:05:31,622
<i>Yeah, and I'm past the wall!</i>

86
00:05:31,706 --> 00:05:34,459
<i>I'm unstoppable! I'm--</i>

87
00:05:34,542 --> 00:05:37,670
You ran out of teleports,
like, 12 teleports ago.

88
00:05:38,254 --> 00:05:39,756
Then I land on you!

89
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:41,466
[both shouting]

90
00:05:42,216 --> 00:05:43,634
Tiny Bow!

91
00:05:43,718 --> 00:05:45,470
No!

92
00:05:46,512 --> 00:05:49,724
Glimmer, we need to come up
with a plan based on reality.

93
00:05:49,807 --> 00:05:54,103
Yes. And in that moment,
I really would land on Bow.

94
00:05:54,645 --> 00:05:55,688
Hmm.

95
00:05:55,938 --> 00:05:59,400
Using a limited number of teleports
isn't a bad idea.

96
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:01,569
So, Glimmer will take Bow

97
00:06:01,652 --> 00:06:05,156
<i>and, using her powers, teleport him</i>
<i>into the turrets' blind spot.</i>

98
00:06:05,239 --> 00:06:09,786
<i>Bow shall act as backup, while you</i>
<i>and I breach the less-patrolled area.</i>

99
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:11,120
[rumbling, then both shout]

100
00:06:13,372 --> 00:06:17,960
-Uh... Why are you playing with dolls?
-We're not playing with dolls!

101
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:20,755
Yeah. They're war-table, battle figures.

102
00:06:20,838 --> 00:06:24,300
And I don't know if I have one for you.
Hold on.

103
00:06:24,383 --> 00:06:30,014
-Wait, aren't you supposed to be on watch?
-Oh, look, the fortress is still there,

104
00:06:30,098 --> 00:06:33,059
like it was an hour ago. Watch complete.

105
00:06:33,142 --> 00:06:34,060
[groans]

106
00:06:34,143 --> 00:06:38,356
-Relax, I switched with Perfuma.
-We're still coming up with a plan.

107
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:40,274
-Am I in the plan?
-We're getting to--

108
00:06:40,358 --> 00:06:45,113
I don't have you, but I do have a seashell
and a happy otter.

109
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:48,616
Uh... Googly eyes? Pass.

110
00:06:48,699 --> 00:06:50,660
-What?
-Can we get back--?

111
00:06:50,743 --> 00:06:52,203
[Mermista] I'll be She-Ra.

112
00:06:52,286 --> 00:06:56,874
-You can't be She-Ra. I'm She-Ra.
-Not anymore. You snooze, you--

113
00:06:56,958 --> 00:06:57,875
[both grunt]

114
00:07:01,796 --> 00:07:03,965
Uh, wow, rude much?

115
00:07:06,384 --> 00:07:07,385
[tablet beeping]

116
00:07:10,346 --> 00:07:14,142
Alert Force Captain Scorpia.
We've got a princess problem.

117
00:07:17,562 --> 00:07:21,732
I admit I got carried away.
But the rest of my plan could work.

118
00:07:21,816 --> 00:07:26,070
Except you're not taking the biggest
variable into account: Catra.

119
00:07:26,154 --> 00:07:28,239
She's been behind every Horde plan,

120
00:07:28,322 --> 00:07:31,117
led the attack on Bright Moon.
She's devious--

121
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:34,078
And I've already thought of that.

122
00:07:34,162 --> 00:07:37,248
I knew destroying the bots
would lure her out.

123
00:07:37,331 --> 00:07:40,668
[chuckles] And so it has, Glimmer.

124
00:07:41,878 --> 00:07:43,045
[purring]

125
00:07:43,838 --> 00:07:46,299
[snorts] This is how you see Catra?

126
00:07:46,382 --> 00:07:50,344
-[laughs] Yeah, this seems a little off.
-[laughs] A little?

127
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:55,141
You fell into my trap.
I've armed the tower with a bomb

128
00:07:55,224 --> 00:07:58,728
capable of taking out
my greatest enemy, you.

129
00:07:58,811 --> 00:08:01,731
Do you expect us to just sit here?

130
00:08:01,814 --> 00:08:07,028
-No, princess, I expect you to--
-I cast Giant Flytrap on Catra!

131
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:09,280
[all shouting]

132
00:08:11,115 --> 00:08:14,952
-Oops. Sorry, Bow.
-Ugh! What are you doing here?

133
00:08:15,036 --> 00:08:17,371
Mermista said you were playing.
We wanna join.

134
00:08:17,455 --> 00:08:21,250
Ugh. We're in the middle
of a very serious planning session.

135
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:25,379
-We have lots of ideas for plans.
-Aren't you on watch right now?

136
00:08:25,463 --> 00:08:31,052
-[groans] But only if you're serious--
-[Frosta] I'm sitting next to Glimmer!

137
00:08:31,135 --> 00:08:33,846
-What does that eat?
-[Frosta] I have ideas,

138
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:36,140
starting with we punch them!

139
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:42,897
Spy Bot, the mission is simple.
Spy on the princesses so I can stop them,

140
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:47,109
and impress Catra so much,
she'll finally admit we're best friends,

141
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:50,863
or at the very least have a bond
that can never be broken. Got that?

142
00:08:51,572 --> 00:08:55,076
Uh, it's not turned on,
and, um, that's not how it works.

143
00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:06,337
Good, yeah. I was just testing you
on whether you knew how to do that.

144
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:09,090
And you passed. So, kudos.

145
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:12,677
Now, let's go spy!

146
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:13,761
[clearing throat]

147
00:09:16,013 --> 00:09:17,598
[Spy Bot powering up]

148
00:09:23,729 --> 00:09:26,983
<i>Oh, aren't you the cutest little fella.</i>

149
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:30,528
Look at you with your little legs
and your antenna.

150
00:09:30,611 --> 00:09:33,322
-You're just the cutest thing I've ever--
-Ahem.

151
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:38,327
Spying, yes.
That is the thing that we are doing.

152
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:40,538
[grunting]

153
00:09:50,548 --> 00:09:52,883
[sighs] Second test.

154
00:09:52,967 --> 00:09:55,886
-Do you want me to drive the Spy Bot?
-Yes, please.

155
00:09:58,014 --> 00:10:01,892
Okay, everyone has a figure,
except Perfuma who's using her plant,

156
00:10:01,976 --> 00:10:04,520
and Mermista who has that for some reason.

157
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:08,899
-Says the guy with a bag of dolls.
-They're war-table, battle figures!

158
00:10:08,983 --> 00:10:11,402
-Okay, so I'm thinking--
-Hold on.

159
00:10:11,485 --> 00:10:15,114
So far I have been shot,
eaten and squashed.

160
00:10:15,197 --> 00:10:19,327
We're doing my plan.
And there will be no death, no dying,

161
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:21,621
just heroic good times.

162
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:23,205
<i>I am Bow.</i>

163
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:27,376
<i>She-Ra's best friend</i>
<i>and defender of Etheria.</i>

164
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:31,589
<i>When the evil Horde strikes,</i>
<i>I strike back.</i>

165
00:10:32,256 --> 00:10:33,466
Ooh!

166
00:10:33,549 --> 00:10:35,551
-We all get hats.
-[groans]

167
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:38,763
After I destroy the turrets
with my trick arrows,

168
00:10:38,846 --> 00:10:40,431
Glimmer teleports us to the tower.

169
00:10:40,514 --> 00:10:44,935
-There, someone waits in the shadows.
-[Catra meows, then laughs]

170
00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:46,103
Catra.

171
00:10:46,187 --> 00:10:53,194
[meows] Fools. I won't let you destroy
my purrfect plan!

172
00:10:53,277 --> 00:10:54,528
What?

173
00:10:54,612 --> 00:10:57,198
[laughing] This is kind of amazing.

174
00:10:57,531 --> 00:11:01,202
It looks like I've got you meow,
evil doer!

175
00:11:01,285 --> 00:11:06,290
I'd paws to reflect on your upcoming death
if I were mew.

176
00:11:06,374 --> 00:11:11,629
-I don't know. I'm feline pretty good now.
-Oh, stop. You gotta stop.

177
00:11:11,712 --> 00:11:17,760
-Now we're all hoping this plan kills us.
-Then purr-pare to meet your end!

178
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:19,720
[caterwauling]

179
00:11:19,804 --> 00:11:22,306
Wait, she can do that?

180
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:27,144
No. But I ran out of figures
and only have this left, so she can now.

181
00:11:27,228 --> 00:11:30,731
Also, the Horde has dragons,
as I did not make enough robots.

182
00:11:32,316 --> 00:11:35,611
Not to worry.
I'll shoot her with my net arrow.

183
00:11:40,741 --> 00:11:44,328
-Oh, come on!
-She would obviously duck.

184
00:11:44,412 --> 00:11:46,914
You can't underestimate Catra
or the Horde.

185
00:11:46,997 --> 00:11:50,251
-We can exploit a weakness in the wall.
-Is it my turn?

186
00:11:50,334 --> 00:11:51,752
This isn't a game.

187
00:11:51,836 --> 00:11:55,756
I use my magic to grow a Plant Golem
to take down the tower.

188
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:56,924
[thud]

189
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:59,135
[shouting]

190
00:12:00,302 --> 00:12:02,096
[both screaming]

191
00:12:03,097 --> 00:12:05,516
If it's made out of plants,
how does it roar?

192
00:12:05,599 --> 00:12:08,519
[chuckles] It's plant magic.

193
00:12:10,521 --> 00:12:11,355
[sighs]

194
00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:14,900
Perfuma, we're not just making up
whatever we want.

195
00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:18,446
-Plus, your idea is dumb.
-[scoffs] And what would you do?

196
00:12:18,529 --> 00:12:21,073
Uh... I step forward, and I say...

197
00:12:22,825 --> 00:12:23,742
[both gasping]

198
00:12:24,201 --> 00:12:28,080
I am Mermista.
Fabulous secrets were revealed to me

199
00:12:28,164 --> 00:12:33,294
the day I held aloft my trident and said,
"For the honor of Gray Whales!"

200
00:12:36,213 --> 00:12:37,673
[squeaking]

201
00:12:38,048 --> 00:12:41,886
Then it's like, sparkle, sparkle,
dolphin, sparkle.

202
00:12:41,969 --> 00:12:45,055
-Mermista...
-I get shoes that are slightly better

203
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:47,975
than my normal shoes.
There's probably another dolphin.

204
00:12:48,058 --> 00:12:51,145
-Mermista!
-Then I twirl, and my hair does this thing

205
00:12:51,228 --> 00:12:55,483
where it looks all messy,
but it's actually, like, super-beautiful.

206
00:12:55,566 --> 00:12:58,068
You can't transform into She-Ra!

207
00:12:58,152 --> 00:13:03,240
Uh, duh, I'm Sea-Ra,
Princess of the Oceans, obviously.

208
00:13:03,324 --> 00:13:08,078
No. If she gets to be Sea-Ra,
I get to have a Plant Golem.

209
00:13:08,162 --> 00:13:11,582
The Winter's Bane needs no help
from a plant.

210
00:13:11,665 --> 00:13:12,750
The what?

211
00:13:19,507 --> 00:13:23,010
[Frosta] <i>My enemies know me</i>
<i>as Frostbite Winter's Bane.</i>

212
00:13:23,093 --> 00:13:24,970
<i>My friends call me Bane.</i>

213
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:27,264
<i>That is, if I had any.</i>

214
00:13:27,348 --> 00:13:30,768
But no one comes close
to the Winter's Bane!

215
00:13:32,269 --> 00:13:35,606
She's got a broadsword
that enhances strength plus three.

216
00:13:35,689 --> 00:13:40,528
-Her finishing move is the Snowstrike.
-[Mermista] What's that pink blob?

217
00:13:40,611 --> 00:13:42,947
-Her sidekick. Glimmer.
-What?

218
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:46,909
We're getting so far from the real plan.
Can we please focus?

219
00:13:46,992 --> 00:13:49,912
Yeah. Focus on how I'm not a sidekick!

220
00:13:49,995 --> 00:13:50,955
[chattering]

221
00:13:57,461 --> 00:13:59,880
We've got visual. Turning on the audio.

222
00:14:00,548 --> 00:14:03,759
<i>My army of Plant Golems</i>
<i>will take down the tower instantly.</i>

223
00:14:03,842 --> 00:14:09,014
<i>Frostbite uses Snowstrike to encase</i>
<i>the tower in ice, then crack it, kapow!</i>

224
00:14:09,098 --> 00:14:12,560
<i>You mean Sea-Ra will use</i>
<i>the Trident of Power to blow it up.</i>

225
00:14:12,643 --> 00:14:15,563
[Glimmer]<i> You don't have</i>
<i>a Trident of Power.</i>

226
00:14:15,646 --> 00:14:17,773
[Mermista]<i> Bow, make me</i>
<i>a Trident of Power.</i>

227
00:14:17,856 --> 00:14:19,692
[Bow] <i>I don't wanna die again.</i>

228
00:14:19,775 --> 00:14:21,861
-I can't believe it.
-Me either.

229
00:14:21,944 --> 00:14:27,324
[laughs] They're gonna give us frostbite,
then attack us with a plant golem

230
00:14:27,408 --> 00:14:31,370
and a woman named Sea-Ra,
and Bow's got a Trident of Power?

231
00:14:31,453 --> 00:14:34,415
Who knows what that does?
Oh, we're doomed!

232
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:39,795
Ugh, they're obviously just coming up
with ideas. Terrible ideas.

233
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:41,213
We cannot risk it.

234
00:14:42,047 --> 00:14:44,466
-Get in closer.
-Hey! Get off of me!

235
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:46,719
[Mermista] We should throw Bow
over the wall.

236
00:14:46,802 --> 00:14:48,637
[Bow] Or everyone else over the wall!

237
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:51,056
[Adora] There goes taking this seriously.

238
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:06,989
No! Kyle, go grab one
of the other Spy Bots you packed.

239
00:15:07,072 --> 00:15:08,407
Mm-hm, mm-hm.

240
00:15:08,532 --> 00:15:09,491
Was that my job?

241
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:12,995
Really, Kyle?
I don't know how you haven't been fired.

242
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:17,917
-[Glimmer] I teleport in...
-And run out of teleports.

243
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,254
-My Plant Golem tears down the wall.
-The Horde will set it on fire.

244
00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:24,340
Frostbite smashes the wall.

245
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:28,177
The ice armor cracks as you hit stone.

246
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:32,264
-Sea-Ra destroys the Horde Bots.
-There is no Sea-Ra,

247
00:15:32,348 --> 00:15:36,852
-and you aren't taking Catra into account!
-Oh, sure we are. See?

248
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:41,273
I have a lot of negative things to say.
And I hate flowers.

249
00:15:41,357 --> 00:15:45,444
No, no, no, she's more like,
I love ruining parties.

250
00:15:45,527 --> 00:15:46,737
[laughing mockingly]

251
00:15:47,738 --> 00:15:49,406
I'm a monster!

252
00:15:49,865 --> 00:15:53,535
-[meows] What a...
-Purrfectly evil group.

253
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:54,912
[Catra laughing]

254
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:57,748
No. None of this is right!

255
00:15:58,582 --> 00:15:59,625
[all groaning]

256
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:03,796
We've been here for hours.
It's time we attack.

257
00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:07,675
The Horde will counter
whatever we throw at them. We'll go again.

258
00:16:07,758 --> 00:16:10,302
We won't leave
until we have a perfect plan.

259
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:14,723
Adora, isn't this all going
a little overboard?

260
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:18,811
We've faced the Horde before.
What's the worst that could happen?

261
00:16:19,436 --> 00:16:22,564
You wanna know the worst
that can happen? Fine.

262
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:25,651
I'm the heaviest hitter,
so Catra will separate me,

263
00:16:25,734 --> 00:16:29,989
trap me, take my sword, so something
so I'm helpless when she turns on you.

264
00:16:30,072 --> 00:16:33,826
She knows everything about me,
what I'll do, how to take me out.

265
00:16:33,909 --> 00:16:37,413
They'll overwhelm Frosta and Mermista
with bots, fire on Perfuma.

266
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:42,001
Use her to draw Bow out, pinning him
between the bots and Horde soldiers.

267
00:16:42,084 --> 00:16:46,922
Glimmer will teleport in, she won't have
enough magic to get out, trapping them.

268
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:50,217
Catra will make me watch
before she finishes me off.

269
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:54,763
Everyone is gone, the Horde wins,
Etheria crumbles. It's my fault!

270
00:16:57,433 --> 00:17:01,437
The Horde nearly destroyed Etheria.
We were barely able to stop it.

271
00:17:02,146 --> 00:17:07,192
If this plan isn't perfect,
if I'm not perfect, everyone will--

272
00:17:07,818 --> 00:17:08,861
[Adora sighs]

273
00:17:10,988 --> 00:17:13,782
Adora, I was captured by Shadow Weaver,

274
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:17,202
taken to the Fright Zone
and lost my powers.

275
00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:19,788
Glimmer, not helping.

276
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:24,501
But you know what? We escaped.
I fought without my powers, and we won!

277
00:17:24,585 --> 00:17:27,421
Bad things are going to happen.
That's life.

278
00:17:27,504 --> 00:17:31,300
You can let it paralyze you
or you can roll with it.

279
00:17:31,383 --> 00:17:33,052
Figure out the things you can,

280
00:17:33,135 --> 00:17:37,056
and trust that your friends
have your back for the rest.

281
00:17:41,351 --> 00:17:46,023
-You've got this, Adora.
-I cast friendship and support on my turn.

282
00:17:46,106 --> 00:17:48,734
Here. This is my Trident of Power.

283
00:17:48,817 --> 00:17:52,071
I want you to have it, since Bow
is making me a new one.

284
00:17:52,154 --> 00:17:53,697
-I didn't agree to that.
-You will.

285
00:17:53,781 --> 00:17:58,952
The Winter's Bane stands with you.
Also, me, Frosta stands with you.

286
00:17:59,036 --> 00:18:03,165
-I can't tell if we're still in character.
-Thank you.

287
00:18:03,707 --> 00:18:05,793
So, what do we do now?

288
00:18:05,876 --> 00:18:08,921
We do what we do best. We improvise.

289
00:18:09,546 --> 00:18:11,256
For the honor of Grayskull!

290
00:18:36,156 --> 00:18:37,449
Let's go.

291
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:41,787
[Lonnie] We've added more bots
to the tower's weak points.

292
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:46,208
Kyle is hiding somewhere.
Rogelio is commanding the extra turrets.

293
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:50,712
And if there are plant monsters
or warriors in ice armor or Sea-Ra?

294
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:54,550
[groans] For the last time,
none of that stuff was real.

295
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:57,136
We've reinforced our defenses.
We got this.

296
00:18:57,219 --> 00:18:58,637
Okay. Good.

297
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,389
And thanks, Lonnie.

298
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:05,310
-Who's Rogelio?
-Rogelio, the lizard guy.

299
00:19:05,394 --> 00:19:08,438
-Oh, right. I wondered what his deal was.
-[groans]

300
00:19:08,522 --> 00:19:09,481
[both gasping]

301
00:19:10,315 --> 00:19:11,900
-[Plant Golem roaring]
-No.

302
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:14,403
-No, it can't be!
-[Kyle shouting]

303
00:19:18,448 --> 00:19:19,366
[both shouting]

304
00:19:23,203 --> 00:19:25,122
For the She-Ra!

305
00:19:27,082 --> 00:19:29,501
[stammering] Fire!

306
00:19:30,335 --> 00:19:31,170
[grunting]

307
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:38,677
-Yay, Frosta!
-This is colder than I thought,

308
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,429
but not a problem.

309
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:45,017
Snowstrike!

310
00:19:50,814 --> 00:19:52,149
[grunts]

311
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:54,193
Huh?

312
00:19:56,445 --> 00:20:01,783
-Thanks, Mermista.
-You mean Sea-Ra, Princess of the Oceans.

313
00:20:10,751 --> 00:20:12,878
-Charge!
-I am Sea-Ra!

314
00:20:12,961 --> 00:20:16,006
-Plant magic!
-The Winter's Bane!

315
00:20:16,089 --> 00:20:17,758
-[all shouting]
-[gasps]

316
00:20:18,175 --> 00:20:19,009
[shouts]

317
00:20:25,682 --> 00:20:29,770
-It's over, Catra. You've lost.
-[Scorpia] Catra's not here.

318
00:20:32,439 --> 00:20:34,858
But I'm happy to take you down for her.

319
00:20:34,942 --> 00:20:36,526
[grunting and shouting]

320
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:47,120
[laughs] Whoo!

321
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:49,248
Yeah! Got you!

322
00:20:50,874 --> 00:20:52,251
Bow!

323
00:20:56,922 --> 00:20:58,048
[squealing]

324
00:21:00,467 --> 00:21:01,551
[groans, then panting]

325
00:21:02,636 --> 00:21:04,388
[grunting and shouting]

326
00:21:06,556 --> 00:21:09,726
Catra's really not here
and she left you in charge?

327
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:12,396
Yes. Why do people
keep acting surprised about that?

328
00:21:17,734 --> 00:21:18,902

-[gasps]
-[Scorpia] Bup, bup, bup!

330
00:21:36,461 --> 00:21:39,339
Stay where you are,
or we'll find out if Sparkles

331
00:21:39,423 --> 00:21:41,883
has enough magic to land on her feet.

332
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:45,804
Like I was saying, Catra trusts--
[grunts] Ow!

333
00:21:45,887 --> 00:21:50,058
Hey, you don't hit the person
dangling you over the edge. Stop!

334
00:21:50,726 --> 00:21:51,727
[grunting]

335
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:56,565
-Glimmer, are you okay?
-How was that for improvising?

336
00:21:57,190 --> 00:22:01,820
-Also, it's your turn. I'm out of magic.
-Catra trusts--

Catra-- [shouts]

338
00:22:04,948 --> 00:22:06,450
Catra trusts-- Huh?

339
00:22:07,075 --> 00:22:09,995
Okay, seriously,
how many of you are there?

340
00:22:12,414 --> 00:22:14,833
Oh, too many.

341
00:22:16,126 --> 00:22:17,502
Whoa. [shouting]

342
00:22:21,923 --> 00:22:23,216
[all cheering]

343
00:22:24,843 --> 00:22:28,430
-That was awesome!
-Good planning session.

344
00:22:28,513 --> 00:22:29,598
Thanks, guys.

345
00:22:33,268 --> 00:22:36,104
-All in favor of blaming this on Kyle?
-Oh, yeah.

346
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:39,066
-[Scorpia] Yep. Yeah, that's unanimous.
-Oh, man.
