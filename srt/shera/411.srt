Glimmer will know
we made the right decision.

00:09:45,209 --> 00:09:48,087
Yes. Your friend headed straight
for the center of the island

181
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:49,297
before I could stop her.

182
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:50,631
Sounds like Entrapta.

183
00:09:50,715 --> 00:09:53,426
-Could you point us in the direction--?
-You can't go there.

184
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:55,261
You'd never come back.

185
00:09:55,344 --> 00:09:57,680
It's where the signal is the strongest.

186
00:09:57,763 --> 00:09:58,723
The signal.

187
00:09:58,806 --> 00:10:00,808
That must be the noise I've been hearing.

188
00:10:00,891 --> 00:10:03,144
-What is it?
-You've heard it?

189
00:10:03,728 --> 00:10:05,062
Then we have to hurry.

190
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:09,317
This place is a mass of ancient tech,
mostly degraded,

191
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,651
but some of it still works.

192
00:10:10,735 --> 00:10:14,780
And something at the center of that island
never stopped signaling.

193
00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:16,657
The signal dulls your resolve,

194
00:10:16,741 --> 00:10:19,994
exposes your vulnerabilities,
it pulls you in.

195
00:10:20,161 --> 00:10:23,456
Everything that stays on Beast Island
becomes a part of it eventually.

196
00:10:24,373 --> 00:10:26,250
Why can't Adora and I hear it?

197
00:10:26,334 --> 00:10:28,669
Stay here long enough, and you will.

198
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:32,840
I've heard it every day,
for months, years.

199
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:35,176
I have no sense of time here.

200
00:10:35,384 --> 00:10:36,302
But I fight it.

201
00:10:36,427 --> 00:10:38,638
Nothing will stop me
from getting off this island

202
00:10:38,721 --> 00:10:40,431
and reuniting with my family.

203
00:10:41,932 --> 00:10:44,935
But enough about me. Tell me news
of the Rebellion and Bright Moon.

204
00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:46,937
And my baby girl. You know her?

205
00:10:47,021 --> 00:10:48,648
Glimmer? Sure.

206
00:10:49,106 --> 00:10:49,940
She's...

207
00:10:50,524 --> 00:10:52,234
-Well, she's--
-She's our best friend.

208
00:10:52,568 --> 00:10:54,445
We're the Best Friend Squad.

209
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:56,864
Sounds like my baby girl. Heh.

210
00:10:56,947 --> 00:11:00,660
Always in a hurry to grow up
and be friends with the older kids.

211
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:03,245
What about Angella? Have you seen her?

212
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:06,415
-Your Majesty, I--
-[creature screeching]

213
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:08,417
-What is that?
-We should keep moving.

214
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:10,711
I'll help you find your friend, and then,

215
00:11:10,795 --> 00:11:12,588
can you help me escape this place?

216
00:11:13,297 --> 00:11:14,131
Of course.

217
00:11:14,256 --> 00:11:16,342
We'll all get out of here together.

218
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:18,844
Then why are we waiting? Follow me!

219
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,905
[gasps, then screams]

220
00:11:37,988 --> 00:11:39,115
[panting]

221
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:40,199
[groans]

222
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:43,869
[chuckles]

223
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:45,121
[groans]

224
00:11:45,287 --> 00:11:48,249
So, you're telling me that horses
are now allowed in the War Room,

225
00:11:48,332 --> 00:11:52,211
-and they all get chairs?
-Big important chairs, yep.

226
00:11:52,503 --> 00:11:54,463
And also, unlimited sugar cubes.

227
00:11:56,465 --> 00:11:58,092
Ehh. Sounds good to me.

228
00:12:01,929 --> 00:12:03,472
[grunts]

229
00:12:05,641 --> 00:12:08,644
I can't believe Glimmer's dad
has been alive this whole time.

230
00:12:08,853 --> 00:12:10,062
And he's so cool.

231
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:13,149
[retching]

232
00:12:13,274 --> 00:12:15,359
Little weird,
but I guess that's to be expected

233
00:12:15,443 --> 00:12:16,652
after all this time alone.

234
00:12:16,735 --> 00:12:19,447
Glimmer will be so happy
to see her dad again.

235
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:22,199
She'll have to forgive us
for going against her orders,

236
00:12:22,283 --> 00:12:24,827
escaping Bright Moon
and taking Mara's ship.

237
00:12:25,327 --> 00:12:27,621
Not that we technically did
anything wrong,

238
00:12:27,705 --> 00:12:29,457
or need to be forgiven.

239
00:12:29,832 --> 00:12:31,584
I mean, Glimmer kept us in the dark.

240
00:12:31,709 --> 00:12:33,627
The truth is
she hasn't been a good friend.

241
00:12:34,211 --> 00:12:35,045
But have we been?

242
00:12:35,129 --> 00:12:37,381
Can you even have a fight
with a best friend

243
00:12:37,465 --> 00:12:39,008
and still be best friends?

244
00:12:39,091 --> 00:12:41,594
And don't get me started on Shadow Weaver.

245
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:44,054
Are you okay?

246
00:12:45,389 --> 00:12:47,141
[sighs] Yeah. It's just--

247
00:12:47,975 --> 00:12:49,852
Why can't I be She-Ra here?

248
00:12:50,102 --> 00:12:52,438
What if something on this island
infected the sword,

249
00:12:52,521 --> 00:12:56,984
or what if Glimmer is right
and all I do is ruin everything? I...

250
00:12:57,067 --> 00:12:59,612
I just feel useless.

251
00:13:00,237 --> 00:13:02,406
Hey, you aren't useless.

252
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:03,824
We'll figure this out.

253
00:13:03,908 --> 00:13:07,077
You're still a hero,
I'm still a tech master,

254
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:09,997
-Swift Wind's still--
-[neighing] Woo-hoo!

255
00:13:10,706 --> 00:13:12,625
[shouts] That's not food!

256
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:13,626
[grunting]

257
00:13:14,126 --> 00:13:15,503
[chuckling]

258
00:13:16,337 --> 00:13:17,546
He's still a horse.

259
00:13:17,713 --> 00:13:20,424
But now we've got Cool Sorcerer Dad
helping us.

260
00:13:23,594 --> 00:13:24,428
You're right.

261
00:13:38,108 --> 00:13:39,109
[grunts]

262
00:13:40,528 --> 00:13:43,113
Are you gonna send more spiders
for me to destroy,

263
00:13:43,197 --> 00:13:44,865
or are you gonna talk to me?

264
00:13:45,616 --> 00:13:50,955
The First Ones stole the magic of Etheria,
the magic of my people.

265
00:13:52,414 --> 00:13:54,625
Please, talk to me!

266
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:59,964
That magic is how I stop this war.
It's how I save everyone.

267
00:14:00,589 --> 00:14:04,051
That magic,
the magic at the Heart of Etheria...

268
00:14:07,012 --> 00:14:08,847
I want to use it.

269
00:14:14,228 --> 00:14:17,189
[Light Hope] <i>Temporary</i>
<i>administrator access granted</i>

270
00:14:17,273 --> 00:14:20,067
<i>to Queen Glimmer of Bright Moon.</i>

271
00:14:21,068 --> 00:14:23,404
<i>Queen Glimmer, proceed.</i>

272
00:14:27,992 --> 00:14:29,076
[droning noise]

273
00:14:31,245 --> 00:14:35,416
The signal, it's getting stronger.

274
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:39,169
We're getting closer.
Don't let it distract you.

275
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:42,214
Tell me, what is she like, my Glimmer?

276
00:14:42,464 --> 00:14:43,340
Stubborn.

277
00:14:43,757 --> 00:14:45,134
Real stubborn.

278
00:14:45,843 --> 00:14:47,386
-[scoffs] Bow.
-What?

279
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:48,971
She's also brave.

280
00:14:49,054 --> 00:14:51,473
She's one of the bravest people I know.

281
00:14:52,016 --> 00:14:56,770
I just-- I wanna be the hero she deserves,
and I don't know if I have been.

282
00:14:57,229 --> 00:14:59,106
Great, great.

283
00:14:59,315 --> 00:15:01,984
Oh, and does she still have
her favorite stuffed animal?

284
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:04,820
-The one I made for her, Kowl?
-Oh, yeah.

285
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:07,740
She's even started to use
your sorcerer staff.

286
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:11,410
Isn't that kind of dangerous
for a little kid?

287
00:15:11,535 --> 00:15:12,369
Pfft.

288
00:15:12,453 --> 00:15:13,787
Try telling her that.

289
00:15:13,871 --> 00:15:17,833
Not like she listens to anyone these days,
that is, except for Sha--

290
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:19,001
[chittering]

291
00:15:20,669 --> 00:15:21,503
What is that?

292
00:15:22,671 --> 00:15:23,797
It's the pookas.

293
00:15:23,881 --> 00:15:24,840
[gasps]

294
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:25,925
Pookas?

295
00:15:26,008 --> 00:15:28,344
That sounds adorable.

296
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:32,765
Let me guess,
more razor-sharp scary things?

297
00:15:33,474 --> 00:15:36,727
Pookas travel in packs,
hunting their prey across the island,

298
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:39,313
luring them in and surrounding them
until it's too late.

299
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:42,107
And right now, they're hunting us.

300
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:44,234
[groans]

301
00:15:46,987 --> 00:15:47,988
Run!

302
00:15:49,907 --> 00:15:52,242
We never should've come here
without Glimmer!

303
00:15:52,326 --> 00:15:55,245
She could've teleported us
out in a second.

304
00:15:55,329 --> 00:15:57,539
Why couldn't she just trust us?

305
00:15:57,748 --> 00:15:59,416
Why couldn't she trust me?

306
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:00,584
Glimmer's in the field?

307
00:16:00,668 --> 00:16:02,127
She's fighting? She's too young.

308
00:16:02,211 --> 00:16:03,796
Angella shouldn't have let her--

309
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:09,677
[grunts] Tell me the truth.

310
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,720
Glimmer's not a little girl anymore,
is she?

311
00:16:12,262 --> 00:16:13,806
How long have I been gone?

312
00:16:13,889 --> 00:16:15,140
[chittering stops]

313
00:16:16,058 --> 00:16:19,269
No, no, no,
silence is always for a bad reason.

314
00:16:19,353 --> 00:16:20,813
Where did they go?

315
00:16:25,859 --> 00:16:27,444
It's kind of cute.

316
00:16:27,945 --> 00:16:29,238
-[roaring]
-[shouting]

317
00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:30,155
But mainly scary!

318
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:31,824
I told you!

319
00:16:35,619 --> 00:16:36,620
Swift Wind!

320
00:16:40,249 --> 00:16:41,500
[grunting]

321
00:16:45,713 --> 00:16:48,132
Swift Wind! Wait!

322
00:16:48,215 --> 00:16:50,467
-[droning noise amplifies]
-[grunting]

323
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:55,472
I--

324
00:16:57,808 --> 00:16:58,642
Hang on.

325
00:16:59,727 --> 00:17:03,188
[Swift Wind] The signal.
You hear it, too, now, don't you?

326
00:17:04,148 --> 00:17:05,649
It's so loud.

327
00:17:07,067 --> 00:17:09,528
I can't think straight.

328
00:17:12,531 --> 00:17:13,365
No!

329
00:17:14,908 --> 00:17:18,328
Swift Wind, we have to keep going.
They're right behind us.

330
00:17:18,412 --> 00:17:20,748
We can't stay. The signal's too strong.

331
00:17:20,914 --> 00:17:24,126
The pookas lured us right into a trap.
We have to move!

332
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:25,127
[groaning]

333
00:17:26,003 --> 00:17:28,005
-Bow!
-Bow.

334
00:17:29,506 --> 00:17:31,091
No, not you, too.

335
00:17:31,175 --> 00:17:32,426
You have to fight it.

336
00:17:32,593 --> 00:17:34,011
[Bow] It's too late, isn't it?

337
00:17:36,972 --> 00:17:38,098
We couldn't fix it.

338
00:17:40,142 --> 00:17:42,352
No. We can still get out of here.

339
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:43,645
Micah, help him.

340
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:44,730
[grunting]

341
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:51,653
King Micah!

342
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:58,327
Don't give in now,
not after all this time.

343
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:00,496
We'll get you back to Bright Moon.

344
00:18:00,579 --> 00:18:03,582
Glimmer needs you to come home
and help her be queen and--

345
00:18:03,665 --> 00:18:04,500
[Micah] Queen?

346
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,504
If she's queen, then that means...

347
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:11,590
[grunting]

348
00:18:15,677 --> 00:18:16,678
[Adora] No. No!

349
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:17,721
King Micah.

350
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:19,807
Bow.

351
00:18:20,474 --> 00:18:21,683
Swifty.

352
00:18:23,268 --> 00:18:25,395
Please. I can't do this alone.

353
00:18:25,479 --> 00:18:27,231
I can't-- I can't...

354
00:18:27,314 --> 00:18:29,942
I can't do this.

355
00:18:31,151 --> 00:18:32,569
Glimmer was right.

356
00:18:42,496 --> 00:18:43,914
Take care of each other.

357
00:18:45,624 --> 00:18:46,875
[inaudible dialogue]

358
00:18:54,758 --> 00:18:55,801
Glimmer?

359
00:18:56,552 --> 00:18:57,594
[gasps]

360
00:18:57,928 --> 00:18:59,096
[shouting]

361
00:18:59,596 --> 00:19:01,515
I won't give up!

362
00:19:01,598 --> 00:19:04,351
Not on my friends, not on Etheria,

363
00:19:04,935 --> 00:19:07,020
not on myself!

364
00:19:07,104 --> 00:19:10,357
For the honor of Grayskull!

365
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:25,539
[shouting]

366
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:28,208
[grunting]

367
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:32,713
[groaning]

368
00:19:34,381 --> 00:19:35,215
Huh?

369
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:36,842
You did it.

370
00:19:37,426 --> 00:19:38,635
You're She-Ra again!

371
00:19:39,303 --> 00:19:40,470
[Micah] She-Ra.

372
00:19:42,306 --> 00:19:45,809
It wasn't the signal that was blocking me
from being She-Ra.

373
00:19:45,893 --> 00:19:46,894
It was me.

374
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:49,062
I was afraid of what Glimmer said,

375
00:19:49,438 --> 00:19:52,107
that all I've ever done
was make things worse.

376
00:19:52,274 --> 00:19:54,401
But I promised I'd take care of her,

377
00:19:55,485 --> 00:19:56,737
-[neighs]
-[gasps]

378
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:59,781
take care of everyone, and I will.

379
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:05,245
So, you're the legendary warrior She-Ra,
and my daughter is queen?

380
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:09,208
There's a lot we need to catch you up on,
Your Majesty.

381
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:12,294
But first, let's go save our friends.

382
00:20:12,961 --> 00:20:14,213
[pookas chittering]

383
00:20:19,176 --> 00:20:20,302
[growling]

384
00:20:22,804 --> 00:20:23,680
[grunts]

385
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:36,985
Woo-hoo!

386
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:38,362
Yeah!

387
00:20:38,654 --> 00:20:39,488
We did it!

388
00:20:39,571 --> 00:20:42,950
Take that, you terrifying
yet adorably named creatures!

389
00:20:44,826 --> 00:20:45,744
[whines]

390
00:20:49,456 --> 00:20:50,415
Get behind me.

391
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:56,088
[all gasping]

392
00:20:58,882 --> 00:21:01,426
Princesses! I saved you!

393
00:21:04,554 --> 00:21:05,806
[Glimmer] Light Hope?

394
00:21:06,515 --> 00:21:07,516
Is that you?

395
00:21:08,558 --> 00:21:12,729
The Crystal Castle is intended only
for She-Ra and her steed.

396
00:21:12,813 --> 00:21:14,481
You are trespassing.

397
00:21:14,856 --> 00:21:15,691
[gasps]

398
00:21:16,024 --> 00:21:18,652
Well, She-Ra's not here right now.

399
00:21:19,486 --> 00:21:23,282
She took Bow and ran off
on a stupid mission

400
00:21:23,365 --> 00:21:24,324
and left me.

401
00:21:25,659 --> 00:21:27,327
Left us all behind.

402
00:21:27,411 --> 00:21:31,373
She's too afraid
to use the magic at the Heart of Etheria,

403
00:21:32,165 --> 00:21:33,041
but I'm not.

404
00:21:36,169 --> 00:21:39,548
Perhaps entrusting She-Ra
with this mission was a mistake.

405
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:41,758
Adora is compromised.

406
00:21:41,842 --> 00:21:45,762
She is not willing to do what is necessary
to protect Etheria,

407
00:21:46,513 --> 00:21:47,764
but you are.

408
00:21:48,849 --> 00:21:49,933
Yes.

409
00:21:50,684 --> 00:21:52,769
Adora has made much progress,

410
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:56,398
but she still has not succeeded
in balancing Etheria.

411
00:21:56,857 --> 00:22:02,195
If the planet is not balanced,
the Heart of Etheria cannot be accessed.

412
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:04,114
Balance the planet?

413
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:06,908
What does that mean? And how do I do that?

414
00:22:07,492 --> 00:22:09,911
There is only one piece still missing.

415
00:22:10,954 --> 00:22:13,915
The princesses are conduits
for the Heart's power.

416
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:17,919
They must all be connected
to their Runestones

417
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:20,213
for the Heart of Etheria to function.

418
00:22:20,297 --> 00:22:21,965
And that will make us stronger?

419
00:22:22,674 --> 00:22:26,178
It will give you power
like you've never known.

420
00:22:27,054 --> 00:22:32,476
The final piece is a princess
who has not yet accepted her destiny.

421
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:36,396
<i>A princess robbed of her power</i>
<i>by the Horde's meddling.</i>
