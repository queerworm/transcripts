1
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:32,741
-[sighs] Thanks for coming with me, guys.
-Of course.

2
00:00:33,408 --> 00:00:36,786
And the queen is okay with us taking off?
I would've thought a mission

3
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:39,247
to the Crimson Waste
would've been too risky for her.

4
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:42,584
{\an8}Oh, she hates this idea,
which is why I didn't tell her.

5
00:00:43,126 --> 00:00:47,213
{\an8}It's not like anyone else has a plan
to stop Hordak from opening a portal.

6
00:00:47,297 --> 00:00:51,634
You're right. Tracking Mara's message
to the source is the best lead we have.

7
00:00:51,718 --> 00:00:55,555
{\an8}Plus, for an inhospitable desert,
this place is kind of beautiful.

8
00:00:56,097 --> 00:00:58,391
{\an8}Oh, there's even a cute little bird.

9
00:00:59,184 --> 00:01:01,227
{\an8}-[tweeting]
-[all shouting]

10
00:01:01,311 --> 00:01:03,521
{\an8}Never mind, this place is terrifying.

11
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:06,983
{\an8}Okay, I know it's scary and dangerous,

12
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:09,986
{\an8}but if there is something to do
with portals here,

13
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:12,405
we have to find it for the Rebellion.

14
00:01:12,489 --> 00:01:14,282
And... for me.

15
00:01:16,284 --> 00:01:17,410
Which way now, Bow?

16
00:01:17,494 --> 00:01:18,828
Uh... [laughs]

17
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:21,790
So, uh, slight problem.

18
00:01:21,873 --> 00:01:24,959
Uh, my tracker pad, it's dead.

19
00:01:25,043 --> 00:01:27,879
So, we're without a map,
and the plants are evil. Heh.

20
00:01:27,962 --> 00:01:30,465
But it's okay.
We're coming from the north.

21
00:01:30,548 --> 00:01:33,259
If we keep going south,
we'll cross the center.

22
00:01:33,927 --> 00:01:36,429
And, uh,
I'm something of an expert tracker,

23
00:01:36,513 --> 00:01:39,265
thanks to the Horde's
survival skills training.

24
00:01:39,349 --> 00:01:42,018
We just have to keep going... that way.

25
00:01:42,101 --> 00:01:45,605
Problem solved.
I've got this under control. [laughs]

[Entrapta] Day 135,
this could finally be it.

36
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:35,321
Initiating first test. Here we go. Aha.

37
00:02:50,503 --> 00:02:51,337
[gasps]

38
00:02:53,339 --> 00:02:57,176
-Something's wrong. I'm turning it off.
-No, you fool. It'll blow.

39
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:04,934
[grunting]

40
00:03:05,602 --> 00:03:08,187
This doesn't make any sense.
It should work.

41
00:03:08,271 --> 00:03:12,108
The machine didn't have enough power,
so we added First Ones Tech.

42
00:03:12,191 --> 00:03:15,069
Then it was blowing out the power grid,
so we rerouted it.

43
00:03:15,153 --> 00:03:19,240
Now it's powered, it's functioning,
but it won't activate a portal.

44
00:03:19,782 --> 00:03:21,576
It's like there's a key.

45
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:24,537
Maybe when Catra brings that tech back
from the Crimson Waste--

46
00:03:24,621 --> 00:03:29,334
[laughs] Catra is never coming back
from that fool's errand.

47
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:32,837
The machine is a failure.
We're done here. Get out.

48
00:03:32,921 --> 00:03:36,758
-That was just our first test. If we try--
-I said, we're done.

49
00:03:47,977 --> 00:03:50,188
[all shouting]

50
00:03:55,318 --> 00:03:58,571
Okay, to review, the plants are evil,
tech doesn't work,

51
00:03:58,655 --> 00:04:02,867
and sometimes, a sand dune is
a pile of very angry, sand-colored snakes.

52
00:04:02,951 --> 00:04:05,536
So, I think we're getting
the hang of this.

53
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:09,874
[groans] Why can't I just teleport us
to the center of the Waste?

54
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:14,337
You don't know where it is and would
run out of power before we made it.

55
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:18,007
Oh, thank you for reminding me
that my powers are limited.

56
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:20,218
-You think I don't know--?
-Glimmer.

57
00:04:22,887 --> 00:04:24,347
I'm fine. [chuckles]

58
00:04:24,722 --> 00:04:25,556
Where's Adora?

59
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:27,267
[groans]

60
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:28,768
[rumbling]

61
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:33,856
And quicksand. That is now on our list
of things to avoid.

62
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:36,609
Wow, I'm learning so much today.

63
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:39,529
Adora, you know we support you
all the way,

64
00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:43,574
-but maybe we're not prepared for this.
-We just need a little rest.

65
00:04:43,658 --> 00:04:47,370
-I'll figure out how to build a shelter--
-Or we could go there?

66
00:04:55,586 --> 00:04:57,964
Okay. Problem solved.

67
00:04:58,047 --> 00:05:01,968
We'll get out of the heat,
and maybe there's a map or water inside.

68
00:05:02,051 --> 00:05:04,721
Adora, I doubt
there's anything useful here.

69
00:05:05,221 --> 00:05:08,391
The Crimson Waste's been abandoned
for hundreds of-- [shouts]

70
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:24,324
Just act tough. Try to blend in.

71
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:26,659
[Glimmer] Ha!

72
00:05:27,035 --> 00:05:28,161
[sighs]

73
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:32,081
Good afternoon, fellow patrons.

74
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:35,543
Except, I don't even care
if you do have a good afternoon,

75
00:05:35,626 --> 00:05:37,253
-because I'm bad.
-Bow.

76
00:05:38,546 --> 00:05:41,174
Hi. Is this the center of the Crimson--?

77
00:05:42,091 --> 00:05:44,385
Excuse me? Hello? We--

78
00:05:44,802 --> 00:05:46,179
Okay, that didn't work.

79
00:05:46,262 --> 00:05:50,099
[chuckles] Adora, I'm not so sure
these are the kind of people

80
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:52,185
we should be asking for help.

81
00:05:53,352 --> 00:05:56,731
Hello. Sorry to interrupt, uh,
but we're not from around here,

82
00:05:56,814 --> 00:05:59,734
and we're hoping
someone would give us directions?

83
00:05:59,817 --> 00:06:01,611
You're outsiders.

84
00:06:02,111 --> 00:06:04,113
Uh, yeah, I guess we are.

85
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:07,658
We don't like outsiders here.

86
00:06:07,742 --> 00:06:11,204
And since the Crimson Waste
didn't take care of you...

87
00:06:11,287 --> 00:06:12,163
we will.

88
00:06:12,246 --> 00:06:13,122
[glass breaks]

89
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:21,923
We didn't mean to disturb you.

90
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:23,800
[grunts]

91
00:06:24,926 --> 00:06:27,929
[Huntara] There's only two rules
in the Crimson Waste.

92
00:06:28,012 --> 00:06:30,807
One, the strong make the rules.

93
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:34,685
And two, don't annoy me when I eat.

94
00:06:34,769 --> 00:06:37,647
I made rule one. They broke rule two.

95
00:06:38,189 --> 00:06:40,608
-[all gasp]
-Are you all staring at something?

96
00:06:41,692 --> 00:06:42,777
[whimpering]

97
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:46,531
Kids, what are you doing,
asking these lowlifes for help?

98
00:06:46,614 --> 00:06:50,952
Don't you know you can't trust anyone
in the Crimson Waste?

99
00:06:51,035 --> 00:06:53,830
[chuckles] Up until two minutes ago,

100
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:56,290
we didn't know there was anyone
in the Crimson Waste.

101
00:06:56,374 --> 00:07:00,545
Scoundrels, criminals, outlaws,
all of them. Be careful, kids.

102
00:07:00,628 --> 00:07:03,047
Next time,
I might not be around to save you.

103
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:04,632
Oh, wow.

104
00:07:05,133 --> 00:07:06,342
-We need her.
-What?

105
00:07:06,968 --> 00:07:09,720
Excuse me? Hi, can we join you? Great.

106
00:07:10,179 --> 00:07:11,806
-[giggles]
-[scoffs]

107
00:07:13,307 --> 00:07:16,310
I'm Adora. This is Bow and Glimmer.
And we came to--

108
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:20,731
Blondie, Boy, Glitter, got it. Huntara.
Now what do you want?

109
00:07:22,483 --> 00:07:28,364
-It's Glimmer. Actually, Princess Glimmer.
-Oh, a Princess. Me, too.

110
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:31,659
I'm the Princess of Crimson Waste.
Can you tell?

111
00:07:31,742 --> 00:07:34,036
Or am I not sparkly enough for you?

112
00:07:34,745 --> 00:07:37,832
We're looking for something
in the center of the Crimson Waste.

113
00:07:37,915 --> 00:07:41,878
It's important we find it.
You seem like you know this place well.

114
00:07:42,378 --> 00:07:43,463
Can you take us?

115
00:07:43,546 --> 00:07:47,300
Did you not hear what I just said
about trusting people?

116
00:07:47,383 --> 00:07:50,720
Well, yeah,
but you said that while saving us.

117
00:07:50,803 --> 00:07:53,598
So, you can't be all bad. What do you say?

118
00:07:53,681 --> 00:07:55,016
[laughing]

119
00:07:55,099 --> 00:07:56,767
Excuse us for one moment.

120
00:07:58,311 --> 00:07:59,937
You sure about this, Adora?

121
00:08:00,021 --> 00:08:02,356
All the scary people
are scared of Huntara,

122
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,150
which is not usually a great sign.

123
00:08:07,028 --> 00:08:09,405
We can just ask for a map or--

124
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:12,700
A map won't get us past the scary plants
or quicksand

125
00:08:12,783 --> 00:08:15,495
or whatever else is out there.
We need a guide.

126
00:08:15,578 --> 00:08:20,291
If I say no, you'll go out there
by yourselves and get killed, is that it?

127
00:08:20,374 --> 00:08:22,960
I mean, not ideally, but yeah.

128
00:08:27,298 --> 00:08:28,466
[all groaning]

129
00:08:28,549 --> 00:08:31,135
Looks like you've got yourselves a guide.

130
00:08:31,219 --> 00:08:34,555
Great. See, guys, problem solved.

131
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:37,475
I know Hordak told me to go away,

132
00:08:37,558 --> 00:08:40,311
but I have some ideas
for the portal machine.

133
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:43,481
Emily, will you cut that--? [shouting]

134
00:08:45,942 --> 00:08:46,776
Curious.

135
00:08:51,113 --> 00:08:52,240
[Hordak grunting]

136
00:08:53,824 --> 00:08:55,952
Okay, Emily, you might have a point.

137
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:56,953
[beeping]

138
00:08:57,036 --> 00:09:00,498
Quietly, quietly.

139
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:03,834
[metal clanging]

140
00:09:07,755 --> 00:09:08,631
[shouts]

141
00:09:11,926 --> 00:09:12,885
Hi.

142
00:09:14,095 --> 00:09:16,264
Get out.

143
00:09:16,847 --> 00:09:17,974
Get out right--

144
00:09:18,057 --> 00:09:19,225
[groaning]

145
00:09:27,942 --> 00:09:31,153
So, heh, for a place that's
supposed to be uninhabitable,

146
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:33,698
the Crimson Waste sure is habited.

147
00:09:33,781 --> 00:09:37,034
Crimson Waste takes in all sorts.
They come running from the law,

148
00:09:37,118 --> 00:09:39,662
from their enemies,
from different kingdoms.

149
00:09:40,162 --> 00:09:41,706
-From the Horde?
-[growls]

150
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:45,668
The war will destroy all those idiots
caught up in it.

151
00:09:47,545 --> 00:09:49,130
What are you running from?

152
00:09:49,547 --> 00:09:50,548
[shouting]

153
00:09:54,176 --> 00:09:57,054
Huntara doesn't run from anything.
You got that?

154
00:09:57,138 --> 00:09:58,264
I want to be here.

155
00:10:01,517 --> 00:10:02,560
Wait.

156
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:10,651
Huh. Not bad, Blondie.

157
00:10:10,735 --> 00:10:13,195
What can I say? I'm a fast learner.

158
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,573
Cocky. Heh. I like that.

159
00:10:15,656 --> 00:10:17,992
Give it some time, you'll do well here.

160
00:10:18,075 --> 00:10:19,493
No, thanks.

161
00:10:19,577 --> 00:10:22,496
This has been a really terrible,
snake-filled day.

162
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:25,499
Honestly, I don't know
what we would've done without you.

163
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:27,335
[groans]

164
00:10:33,007 --> 00:10:38,012
-[whispering] We should say something.
-No, we are supporting her. Now, shh.

165
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:40,431
-You shush. Shh.
-Shh.

166
00:10:41,015 --> 00:10:43,100
[both shushing]

167
00:10:43,184 --> 00:10:45,645
-No, you. Quiet.
-What? You.

168
00:10:45,728 --> 00:10:48,939
Your travel companions are loud.

169
00:10:49,023 --> 00:10:52,526
Ha. Well, it's been a long trip
from Bright Moon.

170
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:53,861
Bright Moon? [grunts]

171
00:10:55,404 --> 00:10:57,948
Listen, I know my tracker pad
isn't working,

172
00:10:58,032 --> 00:11:02,662
but I'm sure we're going the wrong way,
a different way than we'd been going.

173
00:11:02,745 --> 00:11:05,456
We wouldn't be going anywhere
without Huntara.

174
00:11:05,539 --> 00:11:08,084
-This is probably just a shortcut.
-[Huntara] We're here.

175
00:11:12,129 --> 00:11:13,047
[gasps]

176
00:11:20,137 --> 00:11:20,971
[gasps]

177
00:11:23,724 --> 00:11:24,767
[Glimmer] Uh...

178
00:11:25,142 --> 00:11:26,060
We're where?

179
00:11:28,312 --> 00:11:30,981
This can't be the center
of the Crimson Waste.

180
00:11:31,065 --> 00:11:33,442
There's nothing here.
There has to be something here.

181
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:35,820
I was so sure. The message said-- [grunts]

182
00:11:36,737 --> 00:11:37,571
What?

183
00:11:37,655 --> 00:11:38,739
[groaning]

184
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:40,991
-[both shouting]
-Adora.

185
00:11:41,575 --> 00:11:42,576
[grunts]

186
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:50,751
[grunting]

187
00:11:53,087 --> 00:11:54,380
For the honor of...

188
00:11:56,882 --> 00:11:58,592
Paralyzing darts.

189
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:03,639
But you probably figured that out,
being a fast learner and all.

190
00:12:05,349 --> 00:12:06,934
[all grunting]

191
00:12:10,062 --> 00:12:12,481
Outsiders are a risk to all of us.

192
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:15,109
I did tell you
not to trust anyone, Blondie.

193
00:12:17,903 --> 00:12:18,779
[gasps]

194
00:12:21,365 --> 00:12:25,953
Ta-da! I made you soup.
Soup always makes me feel better.

195
00:12:26,454 --> 00:12:27,621
[grunting]

196
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:33,544
Okay, I know one big soup
is probably better,

197
00:12:33,627 --> 00:12:35,671
-but they're so cute.
-[sniffs then shouts]

198
00:12:37,465 --> 00:12:39,842
I am not discussing this.

199
00:12:40,551 --> 00:12:42,511
[grunting]

200
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:45,514
[Entrapta] Your armor,

201
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:50,436
-it's holding you together.
-It is none of your concern.

202
00:12:51,187 --> 00:12:55,191
You're from another planet.
That thing in the vitrine looks like you.

203
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:57,526
You've got tech
compensating for your body.

204
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:02,072
As a scientist, I'm not going to stop
until I figure out what's going on.

205
00:13:02,156 --> 00:13:03,866
Now, tell me everything.

206
00:13:04,325 --> 00:13:05,201
[groans]

207
00:13:06,702 --> 00:13:08,204
You wanna know what I am?

208
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:09,580
I am a clone.

209
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:15,294
A clone of the Emperor
of the Known Universe.

210
00:13:16,086 --> 00:13:17,254
<i>Horde Prime.</i>

211
00:13:17,963 --> 00:13:22,343
<i>Horde Prime cloned himself,</i>
<i>building an army to conquer all he saw.</i>

212
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:27,932
<i>Planets, worlds, galaxies fell before us.</i>

213
00:13:28,057 --> 00:13:30,351
<i>I was his top general.</i>

214
00:13:30,809 --> 00:13:33,229
<i>But there was a defect in my cloning,</i>

215
00:13:33,812 --> 00:13:36,232
<i>and defects are worthless to Prime.</i>

216
00:13:40,945 --> 00:13:42,655
<i>I was sent to die on the front lines.</i>

217
00:13:42,738 --> 00:13:47,117
<i>But during battle, a portal opened</i>
<i>and sent me crashing to Etheria.</i>

218
00:13:51,622 --> 00:13:53,165
<i>Stranding me here.</i>

219
00:13:53,624 --> 00:13:58,128
<i>With nothing but a broken ship,</i>
<i>I built an empire.</i>

220
00:13:58,212 --> 00:14:02,132
<i>When my portal opens,</i>
<i>I shall bring forth my brothers' armies</i>

221
00:14:02,216 --> 00:14:03,634
<i>to crush the Rebellion.</i>

222
00:14:04,426 --> 00:14:07,638
<i>And Horde Prime will see</i>
<i>that he was wrong.</i>

223
00:14:07,721 --> 00:14:09,682
<i>I am not a defect.</i>

224
00:14:09,765 --> 00:14:11,684
<i>I am worth something.</i>

225
00:14:11,767 --> 00:14:12,935
[groans]

226
00:14:13,018 --> 00:14:15,479
But my portal machine does not work.

227
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:17,398
I haven't conquered the planet.

228
00:14:17,481 --> 00:14:20,609
I could not even clone
a new body for myself.

229
00:14:21,277 --> 00:14:22,111
Perhaps--

230
00:14:22,778 --> 00:14:24,196
Perhaps Prime was right.

231
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:26,991
-I am a failure.
-[Entrapta shouts]

232
00:14:28,826 --> 00:14:31,328
Oh, no, no, no. I'm listening.
I heard you.

233
00:14:31,412 --> 00:14:34,665
I've got an idea, but I need my tools.
Be right back.

234
00:14:37,084 --> 00:14:40,379
[Glimmer pants]
Okay, ninth time's the charm.

235
00:14:40,462 --> 00:14:43,048
Everyone, hold on. One, two...

236
00:14:43,757 --> 00:14:46,010
[all grunting, then thud]

237
00:14:46,093 --> 00:14:47,344
[Adora] Bow, are you okay?

238
00:14:47,428 --> 00:14:52,892
[Bow] Luckily, everyone landing on my ribs
distracts from the other bruises.

239
00:14:52,975 --> 00:14:56,020
[Glimmer] I'll get it this time. Hold on.

240
00:14:56,854 --> 00:14:57,855
[all grunting]

241
00:14:58,397 --> 00:14:59,857
I'm sick of this.

242
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:03,110
We've been tricked, robbed,
temporarily paralyzed.

243
00:15:03,193 --> 00:15:06,113
-Now we're stuck here in the middle of--
-[Bow] Glimmer.

244
00:15:07,364 --> 00:15:10,868
I mean, I'm so glad
we finally got out of there.

245
00:15:11,952 --> 00:15:12,786
Adora?

246
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:19,752
Having this mission
made me feel in control.

247
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:21,754
After the last few days,

248
00:15:22,546 --> 00:15:25,382
I really needed it. I needed answers.

249
00:15:25,466 --> 00:15:29,011
I thought if I found out more about Mara,
I'd find out more about myself,

250
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:31,472
where I came from and why.

251
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:36,894
And we'll still get those answers.
We're not beat yet.

252
00:15:36,977 --> 00:15:40,064
Sure, this road trip
has been kind of a disaster.

253
00:15:40,481 --> 00:15:42,441
[Glimmer] Pretty standard for us.

254
00:15:42,524 --> 00:15:46,278
But we know you're going through a lot,
and we've got your back,

255
00:15:46,362 --> 00:15:47,780
whatever you need to do.

256
00:15:47,863 --> 00:15:51,742
Besides, it's not like you stole
our weapons and left us stranded.

257
00:15:51,825 --> 00:15:54,662
-[Adora] It's Huntara.
-Exactly. It's Huntara's fault.

258
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:57,456
No. It's Huntara.

259
00:16:02,127 --> 00:16:04,964
Ooh, this is gonna be so much fun.

260
00:16:05,047 --> 00:16:07,424
I do not need your help in this.

261
00:16:07,508 --> 00:16:09,843
[Entrapta] Everybody needs help sometimes.

262
00:16:09,927 --> 00:16:12,930
And you shouldn't be upset
that you're not perfect. Take Emily.

263
00:16:13,013 --> 00:16:16,809
Her programming is glitchy,
the left leg sticks, and she's loud.

264
00:16:17,726 --> 00:16:20,604
Emily's got quirks,
but that's why I like her.

265
00:16:20,688 --> 00:16:24,358
Imperfection is what makes
scientific experimentation possible.

266
00:16:24,441 --> 00:16:26,860
Imperfection is beautiful.

267
00:16:27,611 --> 00:16:29,196
At least to me.

268
00:16:32,449 --> 00:16:33,283
Stand here.

269
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:38,038
And you're really way too obsessed
with this whole failure thing.

270
00:16:38,122 --> 00:16:41,041
-I mean, I'm a failure. Shh.
-You are not a--

271
00:16:41,542 --> 00:16:42,876
I don't fit in.

272
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:45,879
I became friends with Adora,
but she abandoned me.

273
00:16:45,963 --> 00:16:50,009
Then I became friends with Catra,
but she doesn't talk to me anymore.

274
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:53,804
[alarm buzzes]
But that doesn't mean I give up.

275
00:16:53,887 --> 00:16:56,557
I scrounged up more pieces
of First Ones Tech,

276
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:59,601
and I can't think of
a better use for it than this.

277
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:01,061
[grunting]

278
00:17:03,397 --> 00:17:04,481
Ta-da!

279
00:17:06,817 --> 00:17:10,320
Your armor is more of an exoskeleton now.

280
00:17:10,404 --> 00:17:13,991
The tech compensating
for your organic body.

281
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:16,618
What does it feel like?

282
00:17:17,745 --> 00:17:18,746
Powerful.

283
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:19,872
[chuckles]

284
00:17:21,081 --> 00:17:21,915
I--

285
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:26,795
I acknowledge the work you put into this.

286
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:28,630
It is very

287
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:30,674
technologically sound.

288
00:17:31,008 --> 00:17:31,842
[screeches]

289
00:17:31,925 --> 00:17:36,513
Uh... No matter what you say,
you are not a failure.

290
00:17:36,597 --> 00:17:42,352
-Any who discount you are utter fools.
-Thanks.

291
00:17:42,436 --> 00:17:44,938
I like being friends with you, too.

292
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:52,571
What do you think this one does?

293
00:17:52,654 --> 00:17:53,614
[shouts]

294
00:17:56,283 --> 00:17:57,493
Stop messing around.

295
00:17:57,576 --> 00:17:59,828
Come on, we're just having fun.

296
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:03,499
Didn't you see the shock
on those outsiders' faces?

297
00:18:03,999 --> 00:18:05,959
Oh, look at this.

298
00:18:06,043 --> 00:18:08,253
I think Huntara liked them.

299
00:18:08,337 --> 00:18:10,255
Are you feeling guilty?

300
00:18:12,216 --> 00:18:13,092
[grunts]

301
00:18:13,175 --> 00:18:15,594
I did what I had to to keep us all safe.

302
00:18:16,053 --> 00:18:17,096
[laughing]

303
00:18:17,888 --> 00:18:20,682
You mean, keep yourself safe.

304
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:22,434
You act so tough,

305
00:18:22,518 --> 00:18:26,438
but you're running scared from something,
just like the rest of us.

306
00:18:26,522 --> 00:18:27,689
[growls]

307
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:32,569
I don't run away from anything.
I am Huntara of the Crimson Waste.

308
00:18:33,487 --> 00:18:37,783
Nice. I'm Princess Glimmer of Bright Moon,
and I sparkle.

309
00:18:38,826 --> 00:18:39,868
[grunting]

310
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:41,745
[groaning]

311
00:18:42,996 --> 00:18:44,248
[shouting and grunting]

312
00:18:56,844 --> 00:18:58,303
[Adora] That's mine.

313
00:18:58,387 --> 00:19:00,097
Then come and take it.

314
00:19:11,608 --> 00:19:13,152
That's mine.

315
00:19:13,235 --> 00:19:14,736
Then come and take it.

316
00:19:17,531 --> 00:19:18,615
[growls]

317
00:19:21,869 --> 00:19:23,453
[grunts]

318
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:39,428
Ha!

319
00:19:56,278 --> 00:19:57,446
[Adora grunting]

320
00:20:23,013 --> 00:20:24,890
Quick, time for She-Ra.

321
00:20:26,767 --> 00:20:29,019
Wait. You know about She-Ra?

322
00:20:29,102 --> 00:20:30,479
Know about She-Ra?

323
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:31,772
[laughing]

324
00:20:32,147 --> 00:20:33,523
I am She-Ra.

325
00:20:34,566 --> 00:20:36,443
For the honor of Grayskull.

326
00:20:39,738 --> 00:20:42,449
She-Ra is a person?

327
00:20:47,704 --> 00:20:49,623
Where did you hear about She-Ra?

328
00:20:49,706 --> 00:20:54,211
After all, it's not like it's something
they teach you in the Horde.

329
00:20:55,212 --> 00:20:57,172
I was a Horde soldier.

330
00:20:57,631 --> 00:21:01,802
They told us we were heroes
freeing Etheria from the evil Princesses.

331
00:21:02,427 --> 00:21:07,224
But when I saw what we were doing,
how Hordak just threw soldiers away.

332
00:21:08,517 --> 00:21:11,603
Well, you know what we saw.
You were one of us.

333
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:14,690
That's where you learned to fight,
isn't it?

334
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:18,860
-I'd recognize that training anywhere.
-You deserted. I did, too.

335
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:21,780
-And I joined the Rebellion.
-Then you're a fool.

336
00:21:21,863 --> 00:21:24,992
One girl can't make a difference
against the Horde,

337
00:21:25,075 --> 00:21:27,077
even a tall shiny girl like you.

338
00:21:27,577 --> 00:21:31,290
-It's useless to try.
-Maybe, but I'm not alone.

339
00:21:31,873 --> 00:21:34,710
I won't stand by
and watch people get hurt.

340
00:21:34,793 --> 00:21:36,545
And I won't run away.

341
00:21:38,046 --> 00:21:40,048
Huntara, I need your help.

342
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:42,968
I need you to help us find
what we came for.

343
00:21:43,051 --> 00:21:45,887
Together, we can all bring this war
to an end.

344
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:48,557
You need to drop your weapons.

345
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:49,725
[groaning]

346
00:21:49,808 --> 00:21:53,228
Come on, Huntara,
let's grab our loot and go.

347
00:21:57,024 --> 00:21:58,400
[grunting]

348
00:22:04,031 --> 00:22:08,118
You're right. What I saw in the Horde
scared me, and I ran.

349
00:22:08,368 --> 00:22:10,495
But I'm not gonna run anymore.

350
00:22:10,579 --> 00:22:12,831
I face my problems head-on.

351
00:22:12,914 --> 00:22:15,000
And if you're trying to stop the war,

352
00:22:15,834 --> 00:22:19,087
then I will do what I can to help you.

353
00:22:20,255 --> 00:22:23,675
Come on. We've got lots of ground to cover
before we reach the ship.

354
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:24,593
What ship?

355
00:22:32,976 --> 00:22:33,810
Adora...

356
00:22:35,103 --> 00:22:36,188
what is that?

357
00:22:37,397 --> 00:22:38,231
It's--

358
00:22:38,899 --> 00:22:40,233
It's Mara's ship.

359
00:22:42,152 --> 00:22:44,154
