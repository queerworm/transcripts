00:00:17,517 --> 00:00:18,560
[Razz humming]

2
00:00:21,646 --> 00:00:22,480
{\an8}Broom!

3
00:00:22,564 --> 00:00:23,481
Where are you?

4
00:00:23,565 --> 00:00:24,816
{\an8}Broom!

5
00:00:25,734 --> 00:00:27,193
{\an8}Ah. There you are.

6
00:00:27,277 --> 00:00:29,571
{\an8}What are you just sitting around for?

7
00:00:29,654 --> 00:00:31,614
{\an8}Today is an important day!

8
00:00:31,781 --> 00:00:34,284
We have to get ready for our guest.

9
00:00:39,164 --> 00:00:40,081
Perfect.

10
00:00:43,334 --> 00:00:44,919
{\an8}Oh, Adora.

11
00:00:45,003 --> 00:00:46,629
{\an8}You're just in time.

12
00:00:47,213 --> 00:00:49,466
Heh. Razz, I told you before.

13
00:00:49,591 --> 00:00:51,259
My name isn't Adora.

14
00:00:51,843 --> 00:00:52,927
It's Mara.

15
00:00:54,345 --> 00:00:57,474
<i>♪ We're on the edge of greatness ♪</i>

16
00:00:57,557 --> 00:01:00,226
<i>♪ Turning darkness to light ♪</i>

17
00:01:01,436 --> 00:01:05,106
<i>♪ We're right beside you ready to fight ♪</i>

18
00:01:05,815 --> 00:01:08,234
<i>♪ We're gonna win in the end ♪</i>

19
00:01:08,318 --> 00:01:11,654
<i>♪ We must be strong</i>
<i>And we must be brave ♪</i>

20
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:13,448
<i>♪ We must be brave ♪</i>

21
00:01:13,531 --> 00:01:19,162
<i>♪ We gotta find every bit of strength</i>
<i>That we have and never let it go ♪</i>

22
00:01:19,954 --> 00:01:21,831
<i>♪ We must be strong ♪</i>

23
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:28,171
[Razz] Yes, yes, of course you're Mara.

24
00:01:28,254 --> 00:01:29,714
Who else would you be?

25
00:01:29,798 --> 00:01:31,007
Now, come on, silly.

26
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:34,928
We don't have much time.
Today is a very important day.

27
00:01:35,553 --> 00:01:37,472
Why is today important, Razz?

28
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:39,432
Uh, because--

29
00:01:39,516 --> 00:01:41,643
Because it's important-- [gasps]

30
00:01:41,726 --> 00:01:44,354
Because today we are making a pie.

31
00:01:44,562 --> 00:01:45,730
Don't you remember?

32
00:01:45,814 --> 00:01:47,232
You promised!

33
00:01:47,315 --> 00:01:48,441
That sounds great, Razz.

34
00:01:48,525 --> 00:01:50,193
But I can't stay long today.

35
00:01:50,276 --> 00:01:52,320
[Razz] Ah, nonsense, dearie.

36
00:01:52,403 --> 00:01:55,573
Now, will you help Madame Razz
find her rolling pin?

37
00:01:55,698 --> 00:01:57,367
It must be around here somewhere.

38
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:59,202
-It's a rolling--
-[Adora] Madame Razz?

39
00:01:59,285 --> 00:02:00,161
Mara?

40
00:02:00,578 --> 00:02:03,623
Oh, Razz! It's you! I finally found you.

41
00:02:05,708 --> 00:02:07,377
Mm. If you say so, Mara.

42
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:09,212
Now, come on, it's getting so late.

43
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:12,132
I'm not Mara. Ugh! It doesn't matter.

44
00:02:12,215 --> 00:02:15,885
Razz, you have to help me.
Everything's falling apart.

45
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:19,097
The Rebellion is losing worse than ever,
and Glimmer--

46
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:23,810
I need to find another way to help
the Rebellion. We can still win this.

47
00:02:23,893 --> 00:02:25,979
There was something Mara said
in her message.

48
00:02:26,062 --> 00:02:28,398
She talked about some kind of weapon?

49
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:29,566
[gasps]

50
00:02:30,024 --> 00:02:31,693
You do know something.

51
00:02:32,068 --> 00:02:35,405
If there's some kind of First Ones weapon
out there, you need to tell me.

52
00:02:35,488 --> 00:02:38,324
We could use it to defeat the Horde,
and free Etheria,

53
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:41,161
and then Glimmer would finally see
that she was wrong about--

54
00:02:42,078 --> 00:02:43,163
What was that for?

55
00:02:43,538 --> 00:02:46,457
Ah, you need to stop being so forgetful,
Mara.

56
00:02:46,749 --> 00:02:49,294
We're making pie today with Swift Wind.

57
00:02:49,961 --> 00:02:53,381
Once again, I am Adora,
and Swift Wind isn't even--

58
00:02:53,464 --> 00:02:55,091
-[Swift Wind] Hello!
-[shouts]

59
00:02:55,174 --> 00:02:56,885
Swift Wind? What are you doing here?

60
00:02:56,968 --> 00:02:58,970
Oh, I visit Razz all the time.

61
00:02:59,137 --> 00:03:01,723
You gotta check up on old ladies
alone in the woods.

62
00:03:01,806 --> 00:03:03,808
Come on, Adora, have a heart.

63
00:03:04,767 --> 00:03:06,436
Okay. Maybe you can help.

64
00:03:06,603 --> 00:03:09,105
I need Razz to tell me
about Mara's weapon.

65
00:03:09,188 --> 00:03:11,691
Mara's weapon? Like, the sword?

66
00:03:11,774 --> 00:03:13,067
She-Ra's sword?

67
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:16,154
Ooh, did I solve it?
Did I solve the mystery?

68
00:03:16,237 --> 00:03:19,490
No! The weapon Mara talked about
in her last message on the ship.

69
00:03:19,574 --> 00:03:23,328
Bow's with the ship trying to clean it up,
but it's still too glitchy to make out.

70
00:03:23,411 --> 00:03:24,245
This...

71
00:03:25,288 --> 00:03:26,664
-Razz.
-Those.

72
00:03:26,748 --> 00:03:28,082
You knew Mara.

73
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:30,501
Did she ever tell you--?
What are you looking for?

74
00:03:31,127 --> 00:03:34,797
Sugar for the pie!
I must have some around here somewhere.

75
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:37,967
Never mind, I know where we can get more.

76
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:41,137
Come, dearie.
Not a moment to waste, let's go!

77
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:44,766
Apparently, we're making pie.

78
00:03:52,398 --> 00:03:53,775
-Oh, yes.
-[Adora] Wait!

79
00:03:53,858 --> 00:03:56,361
Why are we following a wacky old lady
through the woods?

80
00:03:56,444 --> 00:03:58,655
Because she knows something
about the weapon.

81
00:03:58,821 --> 00:04:00,615
Razz is leading us somewhere important.

82
00:04:00,698 --> 00:04:03,284
Somewhere where I can get answers.
I'm sure of it.

83
00:04:04,369 --> 00:04:07,497
Adora, as your noble steed,
I'd be remiss if I didn't point out

84
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:09,624
that Razz is kind of...

85
00:04:09,832 --> 00:04:14,128
Ha! Have to get up earlier than that
to trick me, Loo-Kee!

86
00:04:14,796 --> 00:04:15,672
[grunting]

87
00:04:17,048 --> 00:04:19,884
Well, you know, she's, uh-- She's Razz.

88
00:04:19,968 --> 00:04:22,303
Do you really think she knows anything?

89
00:04:22,387 --> 00:04:25,014
Madame Razz always shows up
exactly when I need her most.

90
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:28,101
She helped save you,
and she helped stop the portal.

91
00:04:28,184 --> 00:04:29,686
She knows more than she lets on.

92
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:32,689
There is a method to this,
I just have to figure it out.

93
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:35,024
Is losing her part of the method?

94
00:04:36,192 --> 00:04:37,026
Razz?

95
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:39,904
Razz?

96
00:04:41,239 --> 00:04:42,073
Razz?

97
00:04:42,156 --> 00:04:44,701
Adora, come! There's not much time.

98
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:47,245
You need to keep up. Where are you?

99
00:04:48,162 --> 00:04:49,289
[Mara] Who are you?

100
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:51,791
How did you find this place?

101
00:04:52,917 --> 00:04:57,422
Ah, Mara, dearie, there you are.
Madame Razz wondered where you went.

102
00:04:58,089 --> 00:05:00,300
H--? How do you know my name?

103
00:05:00,842 --> 00:05:03,970
Oh, is this the first time?

104
00:05:04,053 --> 00:05:08,641
[gasps] It's been so long
since it was the first time.

105
00:05:08,725 --> 00:05:09,684
[chuckles]

106
00:05:10,101 --> 00:05:13,146
Never mind,
Razz is only here to borrow some sugar.

107
00:05:13,229 --> 00:05:14,063
What--? Hey!

108
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:17,400
This location is highly classified,
you can't just--

109
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:20,153
[Razz]
How can you find anything in here, Adora?

110
00:05:20,236 --> 00:05:21,696
-This place is a mess!
-Give it--

111
00:05:23,114 --> 00:05:24,198
[grunting]

112
00:05:30,872 --> 00:05:32,290
Magic.

113
00:05:32,373 --> 00:05:34,667
You know how to use magic.

114
00:05:35,084 --> 00:05:36,210
[laughs]

115
00:05:37,128 --> 00:05:38,171
Hey, stop that!

116
00:05:39,964 --> 00:05:40,882
Wow.

117
00:05:44,052 --> 00:05:45,136
No-- Don't--

118
00:05:45,219 --> 00:05:47,680
-Mine! It's mine! I--
-[grunting]

119
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:49,974
-Intruder detected.
-[both shout]

120
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:52,935
Razzle Dazzle!

121
00:05:53,936 --> 00:05:56,147
Mara, who is this person?

122
00:05:56,731 --> 00:05:57,982
I don't know.

123
00:05:58,066 --> 00:05:59,358
She just wandered in.

124
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:01,569
Do you see the ghost, too?

125
00:06:01,819 --> 00:06:03,071
[laughing]

126
00:06:03,154 --> 00:06:07,075
Her presence is unauthorized.
You must remove her from the premises

127
00:06:07,158 --> 00:06:09,160
or I will be forced
to alert your superiors.

128
00:06:09,243 --> 00:06:11,996
Your ghost is mean. Ah.

129
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,791
-What are you looking for?
-[Razz] Sugar!

130
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:18,753
How can Madame Razz make a pie
without sugar? Ah.

131
00:06:19,378 --> 00:06:21,130
Don't ask such silly questions, Adora.

132
00:06:21,923 --> 00:06:22,882
Adora?

133
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:28,054
[Razz] I need to get up.

134
00:06:28,137 --> 00:06:30,056
-Why do I put it so high?
-Razz, is it?

135
00:06:31,432 --> 00:06:33,226
All right, here you go. Sugar.

136
00:06:33,309 --> 00:06:35,478
Ah! Thank you, dearie.

137
00:06:38,022 --> 00:06:40,441
You cannot let her take things and leave.

138
00:06:40,608 --> 00:06:43,152
She could've been exposed
to classified data

139
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:45,071
about the Heart of Etheria Project.

140
00:06:45,154 --> 00:06:47,865
We need to detain and interrogate her.

141
00:06:48,366 --> 00:06:50,660
You really think
she's somehow found information

142
00:06:50,743 --> 00:06:54,455
about a project so classified
even I don't know all the details?

143
00:06:54,664 --> 00:06:57,625
Come on, Hope, look at her,
she's clearly harmless.

144
00:06:57,708 --> 00:07:01,754
Besides, we're here
to study this planet's magic, aren't we?

145
00:07:01,838 --> 00:07:05,508
Who'd know more about Etheria's magic
than the Etherians?

146
00:07:05,842 --> 00:07:07,802
You know I have to report this.

147
00:07:08,427 --> 00:07:09,846
It is in my programming.

148
00:07:10,513 --> 00:07:13,224
Can't you let it slide? Please, Hope?

149
00:07:13,808 --> 00:07:14,642
For me?

150
00:07:17,854 --> 00:07:22,150
Unauthorized presence, not detected.

151
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:26,446
Any reports to the contrary are incorrect.

152
00:07:27,238 --> 00:07:29,949
Thanks, Hope.
Couldn't ask for a better friend!

153
00:07:31,784 --> 00:07:32,618
Friend.

154
00:07:34,412 --> 00:07:37,540
[Mara] Okay, Razz, promise you'll stay
away from the ship from now on.

155
00:07:37,623 --> 00:07:39,125
Sure thing, Adora.

156
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:40,209
See you tomorrow.

157
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:42,253
No, you can't come back tomorrow.

158
00:07:42,336 --> 00:07:45,256
And why do you keep calling me Adora?
Who's Adora?

159
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:46,966
Razz, wait!

160
00:07:48,259 --> 00:07:49,093
There you are.

161
00:07:54,098 --> 00:07:58,311
Oh, it's a First Ones' ruin.
I told you Razz was taking me somewhere.

162
00:08:07,528 --> 00:08:09,614
These marks were made with a sword.

163
00:08:12,575 --> 00:08:13,618
Mara's sword.

164
00:08:14,744 --> 00:08:15,912
She was here.

165
00:08:16,954 --> 00:08:18,206
She did this.

166
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:29,258
[Swift Wind] Wow. Mara did this?

167
00:08:30,301 --> 00:08:31,552
She really was crazy.

168
00:08:36,265 --> 00:08:37,183
[Razz] Aha!

169
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:38,976
You found it.

170
00:08:39,435 --> 00:08:41,229
Found what? What does it mean?

171
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:42,939
Sugar!

172
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:44,941
Now we just need the berries.

173
00:08:49,612 --> 00:08:50,780
[Razz humming]

174
00:08:53,741 --> 00:08:56,536
Razz, this was left deliberately.

175
00:08:56,702 --> 00:08:58,037
Did it belong to Mara?

176
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:01,207
Oh, yes, dearie. She left it for you.

177
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:03,209
-She wants to talk to you.
-What?

178
00:09:03,292 --> 00:09:06,420
Come on, slowpoke.
Help an old lady pick some berries.

179
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:08,506
Razz, Mara's gone.

180
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:11,300
She's been gone for a thousand years.

181
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:15,555
Hmm? No, that doesn't sound right.
She's helping me make a pie today.

182
00:09:15,638 --> 00:09:17,223
She promised, you know.

183
00:09:17,306 --> 00:09:19,642
No, I'm helping you make a pie.

184
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:21,519
Yes, that's what I said.

185
00:09:22,186 --> 00:09:23,020
[sighs]

186
00:09:26,315 --> 00:09:30,528
Razz, why is today
the day we have to make pie?

187
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:32,697
Because today is important.

188
00:09:33,322 --> 00:09:35,116
But why is it important?

189
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:36,242
Uh...

190
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:40,037
It's important because, uh-- Because--

191
00:09:40,496 --> 00:09:42,748
Oh, because I have to duck! [shouts]

192
00:09:49,463 --> 00:09:50,631
[roaring]

193
00:09:51,132 --> 00:09:52,133
Watch out!

194
00:09:52,633 --> 00:09:55,136
For the honor of Grayskull!

195
00:10:14,572 --> 00:10:16,198
[grunting and shouting]

196
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:30,713
Razz, run!

197
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:32,048
Mara, no!

198
00:10:32,757 --> 00:10:33,883
[shouts]

199
00:10:40,931 --> 00:10:42,266
Stop!

200
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:49,523
It's all right.

201
00:10:49,607 --> 00:10:51,817
No one here will hurt you.

202
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:53,277
[roars]

203
00:10:53,819 --> 00:10:55,404
[stammering]

204
00:11:23,808 --> 00:11:24,934
Go now.

205
00:11:25,226 --> 00:11:26,602
Be at peace.

206
00:11:32,691 --> 00:11:33,526
Razz?

207
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:38,531
I'm sorry,
I thought it was gonna hurt you. I--

208
00:11:38,614 --> 00:11:41,534
That's all right, dearie. Come here.

209
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:43,702
Wha--? What are you do--?

210
00:11:46,872 --> 00:11:47,957
[gasps]

211
00:11:53,462 --> 00:11:55,214
How am I doing this?

212
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:58,384
How is it possible without the sword?

213
00:11:58,467 --> 00:11:59,427
[laughs]

214
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:02,304
She-Ra is not a sword.

215
00:12:02,721 --> 00:12:04,723
She-Ra is you.

216
00:12:07,685 --> 00:12:10,146
Etheria chose you.

217
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:16,277
But my people chose me to be She-Ra.

218
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:18,863
I need the sword
to control She-Ra's magic.

219
00:12:18,946 --> 00:12:21,115
That's what my superiors always told me.

220
00:12:21,198 --> 00:12:22,074
[Razz laughs]

221
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:26,162
She-Ra was here
long before your people arrived.

222
00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:28,414
You cannot control magic.

223
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:31,167
Magic simply is.

224
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:35,379
I love Etheria.

225
00:12:36,046 --> 00:12:39,258
I love how old, and weird,
and beautiful it is.

226
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:43,971
I'm sworn to protect it as She-Ra
just as I'm sworn to serve my people.

227
00:12:44,054 --> 00:12:47,850
But I know we're doing something
to the planet.

228
00:12:48,392 --> 00:12:50,102
The Heart of Etheria Project,

229
00:12:50,561 --> 00:12:53,189
I don't know all the details,
but I know it's big.

230
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:57,401
They say we're the heroes,
but I don't know if it's right.

231
00:12:58,277 --> 00:13:00,488
She-Ra protects Etheria.

232
00:13:00,779 --> 00:13:04,742
Your people made the sword,
but they did not make She-Ra.

233
00:13:05,659 --> 00:13:06,869
[Adora] What people?

234
00:13:06,952 --> 00:13:09,497
Are you talking about the First Ones?

235
00:13:10,331 --> 00:13:11,290
The Sword...

236
00:13:12,124 --> 00:13:13,417
Mara...

237
00:13:14,543 --> 00:13:16,420
She said she would come back.

238
00:13:17,046 --> 00:13:18,297
She promised.

239
00:13:18,881 --> 00:13:20,758
We were going to make the pie.

240
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:23,928
I've been waiting for so long.

241
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:27,389
Mara? She was here, too, wasn't she?

242
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:31,977
Everything we're doing,
the berries, the sugar, making the pie,

243
00:13:32,937 --> 00:13:34,271
it helps you remember.

244
00:13:34,522 --> 00:13:35,814
[Razz] Oh, Mara.

245
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:39,276
You were never supposed to succeed.

246
00:13:40,027 --> 00:13:41,779
They made a plan for you.

247
00:13:42,446 --> 00:13:44,823
Razz could not do anything to help.

248
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:46,909
I am sorry.

249
00:13:47,868 --> 00:13:48,911
Then help me.

250
00:13:49,286 --> 00:13:50,704
Adora, not Mara.

251
00:13:51,705 --> 00:13:52,748
Adora?

252
00:13:53,207 --> 00:13:56,001
Yes. Mara wanted me to warn Adora.

253
00:13:56,418 --> 00:13:59,964
There is a great evil
at the Heart of Etheria, Adora,

254
00:14:00,256 --> 00:14:01,924
and it is waking up again.

255
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:04,218
You need to talk to Mara.

256
00:14:04,718 --> 00:14:07,429
[gasps] It's getting late.
We have to hurry.

257
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:09,056
We have to put the pie in.

258
00:14:10,015 --> 00:14:11,183
What?

259
00:14:12,101 --> 00:14:14,270
Not much time, not much time...

260
00:14:16,647 --> 00:14:18,023
Okay. Razz.

261
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:21,986
What was it that you were just saying
about the evil at the Heart of Etheria?

262
00:14:22,069 --> 00:14:22,903
Huh?

263
00:14:22,987 --> 00:14:25,447
-Doesn't ring a bell.
-What's at the Heart of Etheria?

264
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:30,160
Light Hope said Mara snapped,
but there's gotta be more to it than that.

265
00:14:30,244 --> 00:14:33,873
There was a reason why she broke
everything, why she put us in Despondos.

266
00:14:34,456 --> 00:14:38,294
She was afraid of something.

267
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:42,131
Was-- Was she afraid of the sword somehow?

268
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,091
Of being She-Ra?

269
00:14:44,633 --> 00:14:47,052
No, no time, there's no time.

270
00:14:47,845 --> 00:14:50,681
Please, Razz.
You have to remember something.

271
00:14:51,932 --> 00:14:54,018
Remember, remember.

272
00:14:54,435 --> 00:14:57,396
I try to remember,
but it gets all muddled up.

273
00:14:57,479 --> 00:14:59,356
Adora, Mara...

274
00:14:59,648 --> 00:15:01,233
It always ends the same.

275
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,485
The present, the future...

276
00:15:04,612 --> 00:15:05,446
[Mara] Razz?

277
00:15:05,654 --> 00:15:06,822
The past.

278
00:15:09,116 --> 00:15:13,287
Mara, dearie, you're just in time,
the pie is almost...

279
00:15:15,998 --> 00:15:17,249
I can't stay long, Razz.

280
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:21,003
Nonsense, we're making pie today.
Or have you forgotten?

281
00:15:21,086 --> 00:15:22,004
Ah-ah-ah.

282
00:15:22,254 --> 00:15:24,089
And they say my memory is bad.

283
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:25,090
[laughs]

284
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:26,258
Razz, listen.

285
00:15:26,342 --> 00:15:29,678
I figured out what my people are doing
with the Heart of Etheria.

286
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:31,388
What they've done to the planet.

287
00:15:31,472 --> 00:15:34,099
It's going to activate soon,
there's no time.

288
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:35,768
I have to get to my ship.

289
00:15:36,393 --> 00:15:37,311
[grunts]

290
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:38,687
It's starting.

291
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,440
But the pie?

292
00:15:42,733 --> 00:15:46,487
Tomorrow, Razz,
we'll make a pie tomorrow, I promise.

293
00:15:47,738 --> 00:15:48,656
[Mara grunting]

294
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:54,161
I can't stop it.

295
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:57,790
But I can keep them
from hurting anyone else.

296
00:15:58,666 --> 00:15:59,750
Mara!

297
00:16:09,593 --> 00:16:10,803
[grunting]

298
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:15,140
[screaming]

299
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:35,494
[bell dings]

300
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:37,496
It's time.

301
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:40,874
[snoring]

302
00:16:47,464 --> 00:16:48,382
Razz?

303
00:16:49,967 --> 00:16:51,468
-Razz!
-What?

304
00:16:51,552 --> 00:16:53,971
-Come on, Swifty.
-Where are we going?

305
00:16:55,347 --> 00:16:56,306
The pie's done.

306
00:17:05,232 --> 00:17:06,233
[Mara grunting]

307
00:17:25,377 --> 00:17:26,253
[gasps]

308
00:17:26,336 --> 00:17:27,671
You're not Mara!

309
00:17:27,755 --> 00:17:29,214
[shouting] Ow.

310
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:30,591
Madame Razz?

311
00:17:30,674 --> 00:17:34,011
Adora, help me find Mara,
you know where she is.

312
00:17:35,846 --> 00:17:37,389
Adora, who's that lady?

313
00:17:37,473 --> 00:17:39,391
It's okay, it's just Razz.

314
00:17:39,975 --> 00:17:41,810
-Madame Razz?
-[Razz] Adora!

315
00:17:43,437 --> 00:17:45,773
You need to talk to Mara.

316
00:17:45,856 --> 00:17:48,317
You have everything you need.

317
00:17:48,859 --> 00:17:50,194
I have everything I--

318
00:17:56,366 --> 00:17:57,493
What are you doing?

319
00:17:59,036 --> 00:17:59,912
[gasps]

320
00:17:59,995 --> 00:18:01,580
Wait, I know this.

321
00:18:03,624 --> 00:18:04,792
She-Ra!

322
00:18:08,796 --> 00:18:09,922
[grunting]

323
00:18:15,052 --> 00:18:17,304
[Light Hope] What are you doing, Mara?

324
00:18:19,264 --> 00:18:24,103
You have de-- De--
Destroyed my intraplanetary systems.

325
00:18:24,728 --> 00:18:28,315
You are behave-- Be--
Behaving erratically.

326
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:31,026
Where is the sword, Mara?

327
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:32,903
The sword is gone.

328
00:18:33,278 --> 00:18:35,781
There's not going to be a She-Ra anymore.

329
00:18:36,573 --> 00:18:38,867
It is your destiny to be She-Ra.

330
00:18:39,243 --> 00:18:42,871
She-Ra's destiny
was to be a part of your machine.

331
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:46,208
But I won't ever let you use her again.

332
00:18:48,836 --> 00:18:51,755
The Heart of Etheria has been activated.

333
00:18:51,922 --> 00:18:53,757
Your mission will be fulfilled.

334
00:18:54,424 --> 00:18:57,136
There will be peace throughout the galaxy.

335
00:18:57,719 --> 00:18:59,304
You will be a hero.

336
00:19:00,597 --> 00:19:02,891
How will destroying worlds bring peace?

337
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:06,478
You're trying to di-- Disable me.

338
00:19:07,521 --> 00:19:08,647
It will not work.

339
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:12,901
The Heart of Etheria
will achieve its function, as will you.

340
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:15,654
You are She-Ra.

341
00:19:16,446 --> 00:19:18,282
This is your destiny.

342
00:19:19,867 --> 00:19:21,535
You're not Light Hope.

343
00:19:21,618 --> 00:19:24,288
I am the same basic operating system.

344
00:19:24,371 --> 00:19:25,414
You're not her.

345
00:19:25,747 --> 00:19:28,167
And you don't get to tell me
what my destiny is.

346
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:29,459
[powering down]

347
00:19:31,753 --> 00:19:38,135
Activating portal into the Dimension
of Despondos in three, two, one.

348
00:19:52,816 --> 00:19:53,734
[Mara] Adora...

349
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:59,948
I know you're there.
Razz said you would be there.

350
00:20:00,532 --> 00:20:01,450
Mara?

351
00:20:08,415 --> 00:20:09,583
[Mara grunting]

352
00:20:12,461 --> 00:20:15,297
I don't have much time.
I barely made it out.

353
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:18,050
If you are seeing this,
it means you are the new She-Ra.

354
00:20:18,133 --> 00:20:19,468
It means I failed.

355
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:22,638
I don't know what they told you,
it wasn't all bad at first.

356
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:26,934
We were the first ones to settle Etheria,
to really study this planet's magic.

357
00:20:28,936 --> 00:20:30,604
How could it go so wrong?

358
00:20:31,521 --> 00:20:33,148
You can't trust Light Hope.

359
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:36,401
She's been reprogrammed
to set off the weapon at any cost.

360
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:39,821
-The weapon...
-The weapon. What is it?

361
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:42,199
Didn't know what they were doing
until too late.

362
00:20:42,282 --> 00:20:45,369
I knew they were rerouting Etheria's magic
for their own purposes.

363
00:20:45,452 --> 00:20:47,663
Siphoning it,
collecting it in the planet's core.

364
00:20:48,538 --> 00:20:49,915
The Heart of Etheria.

365
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:52,668
The Heart of Etheria Project.

366
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:56,171
It was supposed to be an energy source,
capable of so much good.

367
00:20:56,546 --> 00:20:57,923
But that's not what they made.

368
00:20:58,006 --> 00:21:01,260
My people turned our planet,
all of Etheria, into a weapon.

369
00:21:01,343 --> 00:21:03,303
And She-Ra is the key.

370
00:21:03,512 --> 00:21:04,721
What?

371
00:21:04,805 --> 00:21:08,475
I opened a portal to a completely empty
dimension and pulled Etheria in.

372
00:21:08,558 --> 00:21:12,104
I hid us from the rest of the universe
to keep everyone safe.

373
00:21:12,187 --> 00:21:14,731
This is the one place
they'll never find us.

374
00:21:14,815 --> 00:21:16,775
The weapon can't hurt anyone else here.

375
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:20,487
I saw what they would do.
The deaths that would follow.

376
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:22,990
I couldn't stop them before,
but I can now.

377
00:21:23,073 --> 00:21:24,825
Hiding is our only option.

378
00:21:28,787 --> 00:21:31,248
Adora, this isn't over.

379
00:21:31,581 --> 00:21:34,960
The Heart of Etheria
is still siphoning magic, storing it.

380
00:21:35,043 --> 00:21:38,171
It's unstable. It will tear Etheria apart
if it goes off again.

381
00:21:45,053 --> 00:21:46,471
So, it's up to you now.

382
00:21:46,555 --> 00:21:49,308
I couldn't stop it.
In the end, I wasn't strong enough.

383
00:21:49,391 --> 00:21:53,520
But you, Adora, you will be more powerful
than they ever planned.

384
00:21:59,943 --> 00:22:00,944
[grunting]

385
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:08,827
Adora, I believe in you.

386
00:22:09,453 --> 00:22:11,455
You can save the world we love.

387
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:19,171
The weapon...

388
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:21,631
The weapon is Etheria.

389
00:22:22,883 --> 00:22:23,759
And Mara...

390
00:22:24,676 --> 00:22:27,512
sacrificed herself to save everyone.

391
00:22:30,849 --> 00:22:32,100
[laughs]

392
00:22:32,184 --> 00:22:34,561
She was brave, my Mara.

393
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:38,398
For you, Mara, dearie.

394
00:22:43,862 --> 00:22:45,322
[closing theme playing]
