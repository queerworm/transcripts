{\an8}-This is where we're holding the prisoner.
-This is your prison?

20
00:01:32,175 --> 00:01:35,720
{\an8}Well, technically it's the spare room,
but it is more than adequate

21
00:01:35,804 --> 00:01:36,888
{\an8}as a holding cell.

22
00:01:37,472 --> 00:01:39,057
{\an8}We removed the cushions.

23
00:01:40,308 --> 00:01:42,560
-Most of the cushions.
-This is the prison?

24
00:01:42,644 --> 00:01:44,312
Yes, it's the prison.

{\an8}Your Majesty, I know Shadow Weaver.

26
00:01:46,856 --> 00:01:49,901
{\an8}I know her tricks.
I need to be there for the interrogation,

-I'm the only one who--
-Shadow Weaver is dangerous.

28
00:01:52,487 --> 00:01:54,280
I will not let that woman near you.

29
00:01:54,364 --> 00:01:57,492
Near any of you.
You are to stay away from this room.

-That is final.

Shadow Weaver could have gone anywhere,
but she came here.

34
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,299
I need to know why.

35
00:02:13,383 --> 00:02:17,846
-If the queen would just listen to me--
-Adora, maybe this is for the best.

36
00:02:17,929 --> 00:02:21,432
Shadow Weaver raised you.
She knows how to get in your head.

37
00:02:21,516 --> 00:02:23,726
We can't risk her manipulating you.

38
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:25,145
That won't happen.

head back to bed, get some sleep, heh,

00:02:34,863 --> 00:02:38,199

Bright Moon Guards handle this.

00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:03,474
You're in the Bright Moon prison.

[Shadow Weaver] This is a prison?

51
00:03:07,061 --> 00:03:10,815
Why does everyone keep--?
Of course, this is a prison. [groans]

You must be Glimmer's mother.

I can tell by the way your voice
grows shrill when you scream.

-How dare you?
-Shadow Weaver.

55
00:03:19,908 --> 00:03:22,327
You will answer
for the crimes you committed

00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:26,205
-during your time as my brother's teacher.
-[Shadow Weaver] Oh, yes.

Sweet, talented Micah.

58
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:32,211
You will not speak his name.

59
00:03:32,295 --> 00:03:35,131

to defeat the Horde,

63
00:03:48,394 --> 00:03:51,856

Very high-level, dangerous stuff.

Now come on, I'm busting you out.
We don't have time before--

77
00:04:31,437 --> 00:04:32,438
Before what?

78
00:04:32,522 --> 00:04:36,901
Uh... Hordak. He's called an assembly
to witness your punishment.

79
00:04:37,902 --> 00:04:39,862
But I'm sure it's--

80
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:43,741
It's probably nothing,
but whatever it is, I won't let it happen.

81
00:04:43,825 --> 00:04:46,953
I'm gonna get you out of here.
Gosh, these buttons are tiny.

82
00:04:47,036 --> 00:04:50,081
Just so small. Ah, hit the wrong one.
[laughs]

83
00:04:50,164 --> 00:04:52,792
Okay, just a second.
Oh, shoot, not that one.

84
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:53,710
Stop it.

85
00:04:54,043 --> 00:04:57,213

I did everything right.

I don't get to win.

88

Shadow Weaver was right.

89
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:08,308
She's not right.

90
00:05:08,391 --> 00:05:11,060
Don't give up yet. I can save you.

91

You really care, don't you?

92
00:05:13,229 --> 00:05:15,815
Of course, I care. You're Catra.

I just need to talk to her.

Ugh, Adora, Shadow Weaver will try
to hurt you again.

112
00:06:55,456 --> 00:06:56,791
You don't know that.

113
00:06:56,874 --> 00:06:59,544
Yes, I do. She's from the Horde.

114
00:06:59,752 --> 00:07:03,256
She's evil. Evil people don't change.

115
00:07:03,339 --> 00:07:07,176
-I'm from the Horde. I changed.
-That's different. You're not like them.

116
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:09,428
You're good, and kind, and--

117
00:07:09,512 --> 00:07:10,388
And She-Ra?

118
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:15,601
I was just like the rest of them,
and then I left.

119
00:07:15,893 --> 00:07:19,897
Not because I picked up this Sword,
but because it was the right thing to do.

120
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:23,568
I have to believe that the others
can change, too. Even Shadow Weaver.

121
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:26,571
Just-- Just trust me, okay?

122
00:07:27,029 --> 00:07:28,698
I'm strong enough to face her now.

123
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:32,076
I need to know if she's truly changed.

124
00:07:32,368 --> 00:07:36,956
If the woman who raised me
still has some good deep down inside her.

125
00:07:37,665 --> 00:07:39,709
Deep, deep down inside her.

126
00:07:41,419 --> 00:07:44,630
We trust you,
but we won't let you face her alone.

127
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:46,632
Now, what do you need us to do?

128
00:07:48,509 --> 00:07:51,846
For the last time, tell us what you know.

129
00:07:51,929 --> 00:07:54,932
[Shadow Weaver]
I know that when you cast a truth spell,

130
00:07:55,016 --> 00:07:59,729
you should make sure
you've drawn it correctly. Sloppy work.

131
00:08:00,271 --> 00:08:02,940
Are you sure you're Micah's sister?

133
00:08:05,193 --> 00:08:09,238
-She's trying to get under our skin.
-You could spare yourself the trouble

134
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:11,991
if you would just let me talk to Adora.

135
00:08:12,617 --> 00:08:16,746
No, you've put that girl through enough.
Now tell us the truth.

136
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:19,081
Why did the Horde send you here?

137
00:08:19,248 --> 00:08:21,501
-What are you planning?
-[Shadow Weaver laughing]

138
00:08:22,293 --> 00:08:24,420
You think Hordak sent me?

139
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:29,467
I escaped from Hordak
and paid the price for it.

140

[coughing]

141
00:08:32,011 --> 00:08:34,305
You're dying, aren't you?

142
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:41,854
Angella, can I speak with you
for a moment?

143
00:08:43,814 --> 00:08:45,274
This isn't working.

144
00:08:45,608 --> 00:08:48,903
We've tried everything,
and her condition is growing worse.

145
00:08:48,986 --> 00:08:52,114
-Perhaps we should let Adora--
-[Angella] That is not going to happen.

146
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:54,283
You guys go in. I'll distract them.

147
00:08:55,076 --> 00:08:57,036
We should consult
with the Princess Alliance

148
00:08:57,119 --> 00:09:01,499
-before we go further.
-Your Majesties. Hey.

149
00:09:01,582 --> 00:09:04,293
So, who wants to see a magic trick?

[Shadow Weaver coughing]

151
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:13,052
[Shadow Weaver] Adora.

152
00:09:13,135 --> 00:09:15,179
Listen up, lady.

153
00:09:15,805 --> 00:09:18,849
After all your kidnapping and mind-wiping,

154
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:22,853
I am just looking for a reason
to serve up a little payback.

155
00:09:22,937 --> 00:09:27,191
-So, if you do anything to hurt Adora--
-Glimmer.

156
00:09:27,942 --> 00:09:29,068
I've got this.

157
00:09:32,488 --> 00:09:35,449
Look at you, my Adora.

158
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:40,538
You snuck into Bright Moon. Why?
That's the only reason we're speaking.

159
00:09:40,621 --> 00:09:42,248
[Shadow Weaver] To see you.

160
00:09:42,331 --> 00:09:44,542
You are the only one I can trust.

161
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:47,044
I've missed you, my child.

162
00:09:47,128 --> 00:09:48,921
We're past that. Try again.

163
00:09:49,463 --> 00:09:52,008
[Shadow Weaver] Clever. You always were.

164
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:56,637
From the moment I laid eyes on you,
I knew you were different.

165
00:09:56,721 --> 00:09:58,723
-You were--
-Special?

166
00:09:58,806 --> 00:10:02,310
No, what you always told me
was that I didn't matter.

167
00:10:02,393 --> 00:10:05,187
I was special only
as long as I obeyed you.

168
00:10:05,396 --> 00:10:06,397
Why are you here?

169
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:09,442
[coughing]

170
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:14,989
What--? What's happening to you?

171
00:10:15,656 --> 00:10:18,492
[Shadow Weaver] It took all
of my magical power to come to you.

172
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:21,120
I am dying, Adora.

173
00:10:21,996 --> 00:10:24,040
-You're lying.
-[Glimmer] Adora.

174
00:10:24,582 --> 00:10:25,833
I don't think she is.

175
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:29,920
[coughing continues]

176
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:38,929
For the Honor of Grayskull.

177
00:10:40,097 --> 00:10:41,098
[Shadow Weaver gasps]

178
00:10:41,182 --> 00:10:45,102
I don't know why you're here,
but I won't let you suffer like this.

179
00:10:45,186 --> 00:10:50,107
I'm going to heal you, Shadow Weaver,
and then you will answer our questions.

180
00:10:50,191 --> 00:10:52,443
Do we have a deal?

181
00:10:52,526 --> 00:10:55,321
Adora, you don't know how to heal.

182
00:10:55,404 --> 00:10:57,990
I can figure it out.
She'll die if I don't.

183
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:00,785
Maybe I can help.

184
00:11:01,702 --> 00:11:05,039
I was once a teacher of magic in Mystacor.

185
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:08,626
I trained your father, Princess.

186
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:10,002
[coughs]

187
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:13,172
I can help you control your magic, Adora,

188
00:11:13,255 --> 00:11:16,634
but first... you must trust me.

189
00:11:20,638 --> 00:11:23,808
Fine, but in return, you trust me.

190
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:26,185
Trust that I'm not stupid.

191
00:11:26,268 --> 00:11:29,271
Trust that I'll see
right through your mind games.

192
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:33,526
Stop lying for once
and trust me with the truth.

193
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:41,325
[grunts]

194
00:11:42,326 --> 00:11:45,538
Hordak, great.
I've got a lot to cover with you today.

195
00:11:45,746 --> 00:11:48,374
I've integrated the First Ones tech
from the Northern Reach

196
00:11:48,457 --> 00:11:51,043
to our portal machine,
but we're still missing something.

197
00:11:51,127 --> 00:11:55,965
Luckily, I just picked up a signal.
It's some sort of First Ones message.

198
00:11:56,048 --> 00:11:59,802
I don't know what these other words are,
but this one's easy. It means "portal."

199
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:02,888
It could be the missing something
we're looking for.

200
00:12:04,181 --> 00:12:05,057
Where's Catra?

201
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:06,809
We should send her out ASAP.

202
00:12:06,934 --> 00:12:09,687
Catra is no longer a concern of yours.

203
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:12,064
She's being sent to Beast Island.

204
00:12:12,148 --> 00:12:14,108
I'm confused.

205
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:19,155
As you can see the overall productivity
of the Horde has increased by 400 percent

206
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:22,616
since Catra has been your
second-in-command. And look at this chart.

207
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:23,576
[grunts]

208
00:12:23,659 --> 00:12:27,788
The evidence shows that First Ones tech
has gotten us closer than ever

209
00:12:27,872 --> 00:12:29,331
to creating a working portal.

210
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:33,002
Catra has been incredibly successful
at getting new tech for us.

211
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:35,379
And this latest signal is coming
from here.

212
00:12:35,671 --> 00:12:36,505
The Crimson Waste.

213
00:12:36,755 --> 00:12:38,966
We don't have a moment to spare.
We need Catra.

214
00:12:39,049 --> 00:12:41,677
[grunts] It is meaningless.

215
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:45,764
I'm not going to squander troops
on a lifeless wasteland.

216
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:47,975
This discussion is over.

217
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:49,727
[sighs]

218
00:12:55,149 --> 00:12:59,904
[Shadow Weaver] You are a Princess,
so, you have a Runestone.

219
00:12:59,987 --> 00:13:02,490
Yours dwells there, within your sword.

220
00:13:02,573 --> 00:13:06,535
With it, you channel the elemental magic
of Etheria.

221
00:13:08,037 --> 00:13:11,415
Let it flow through the sword
and into you.

222
00:13:15,085 --> 00:13:18,631
You must learn to concentrate.
Focus your power.

223
00:13:19,882 --> 00:13:22,760
[grunts] I've tried this before.
I can't get it to work.

224
00:13:22,885 --> 00:13:25,804
What do I do?
Point the sword at you, or what?

225
00:13:25,888 --> 00:13:27,181
[coughing]

226
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:29,141
[Shadow Weaver] Calm down.

227
00:13:29,266 --> 00:13:33,187
Your frustration will cause the energy
you produce to become destructive

228
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:34,522
if you're not careful.

229
00:13:34,605 --> 00:13:38,609
There must be peace in your mind
if you are to heal.

230
00:13:39,443 --> 00:13:43,072
Come closer and allow me to help you.

231
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:52,706
[gasps]

232
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:58,504
You are afraid, but refuse to admit it.

233
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:03,342
Afraid of your power,
of it spiraling out of control.

234
00:14:04,093 --> 00:14:08,097
Let yourself feel it, then move past it.

235
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:09,515
[coughing]

236
00:14:09,598 --> 00:14:12,351
You are greater than your fear.

237
00:14:23,862 --> 00:14:24,822
[gasps]

238
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:26,198
Wow.

239
00:14:31,245 --> 00:14:33,163
What are you doing?

240
00:14:33,247 --> 00:14:35,082
I'm sorry. I tried.

241
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:42,298
[Shadow Weaver gasps]

242
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:46,260
[grunts]

243
00:14:51,056 --> 00:14:51,891
Adora.

244
00:14:54,143 --> 00:14:55,436
[Shadow Weaver sighs]

245
00:14:58,355 --> 00:15:00,649
I told you both to stay out of here.

246
00:15:00,858 --> 00:15:03,736
She's She-Ra, Mom.
What do you expect me to do?

247
00:15:03,819 --> 00:15:07,573
I held up my end. Now you hold up yours.
Why are you here?

248
00:15:08,073 --> 00:15:10,075
[laughing]

249
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:12,703
[Shadow Weaver] You want the truth?

250
00:15:12,786 --> 00:15:14,455
I have nowhere left to go.

251
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:17,082
Catra betrayed me.

252
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:19,710
Hordak cast me aside.

253
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:21,795
I wanna take them down.

254
00:15:22,129 --> 00:15:24,965
And helping you is the best way to do it.

255
00:15:25,549 --> 00:15:30,721
Hordak has been working for years to build
a machine capable of opening a portal

256
00:15:30,804 --> 00:15:32,932
through the fabric of space.

257
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:37,811
He intends to bring the rest
of the Horde's armies through this portal

258
00:15:37,895 --> 00:15:43,150
and use them to conquer Etheria,
once and for all.

259
00:15:43,233 --> 00:15:45,402
Armies? There's more of the Horde?

260
00:15:45,486 --> 00:15:48,656
[Shadow Weaver] A force so large,
you cannot even comprehend it.

261
00:15:48,739 --> 00:15:52,660
You have struggled to hold off
Hordak's paltry troops for years.

262
00:15:52,826 --> 00:15:57,373
You will stand no chance
against the full might of the Horde.

263
00:15:57,456 --> 00:16:00,793
What makes you think he's close
to finishing this portal machine now?

264
00:16:00,876 --> 00:16:03,545
Because he has something
he didn't have before.

265
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:08,550
A Princess who knows
how to combine First Ones technology

266
00:16:08,842 --> 00:16:11,011
with the Horde's machines.

267
00:16:11,261 --> 00:16:15,057
Entrapta. That's why she's been after
all that First Ones tech.

268
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:17,351
How stupid do you think we are?

269
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:20,938
She knows the Horde is losing,
and she's trying to scare us.

270
00:16:21,063 --> 00:16:24,066
Portals to other worlds? It's ridiculous.

271
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:26,068
[Shadow Weaver]
I know how this must sound.

272
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:29,113
We on Etheria have no concept

273
00:16:29,405 --> 00:16:31,824
of a universe beyond our reach.

274
00:16:31,907 --> 00:16:32,950
And yet,

275
00:16:33,033 --> 00:16:36,328
the evidence stands before us.

276
00:16:39,373 --> 00:16:40,332
Me?

277
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:43,127
[Shadow Weaver]
Hordak succeeded once before.

278
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:46,463
Years ago, he opened a portal.

279
00:16:46,547 --> 00:16:48,549
It was only for a moment.

280
00:16:48,632 --> 00:16:52,261
-And in that, a child came through.
-[crying]

281
00:16:52,928 --> 00:16:56,056
That child was you, Adora.

282
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:59,852
You were brought through a portal
from another world.

283
00:16:59,977 --> 00:17:00,811
What?

284
00:17:00,894 --> 00:17:03,856
Leave her alone.
You're lying, we all know it.

285
00:17:03,981 --> 00:17:05,524
You lie about everything.

286
00:17:05,607 --> 00:17:08,777
[Shadow Weaver] I gain nothing from lying.

287
00:17:08,944 --> 00:17:11,697
Adora is different from us.

288
00:17:12,322 --> 00:17:17,202
Do you think just anyone could bring
a dying woman back to life?

289
00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:19,955
Not quite the reunion you pictured, is it?

290
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:23,125
Perhaps you would have preferred
the comfort of lies.

291
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:24,877
I think that's quite enough.

292
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,587
Don't listen to her, Adora.

293
00:17:30,007 --> 00:17:32,217
Where are you going? Adora?

294
00:17:45,147 --> 00:17:46,231
Light Hope.

295
00:17:47,983 --> 00:17:49,443
I know you're here.

296
00:17:50,444 --> 00:17:53,697
Greetings, Adora. I was not expecting you
for training today.

297
00:17:53,781 --> 00:17:56,116
But this shows an uptick
in your dedication.

298
00:17:56,658 --> 00:17:59,119
You said you've been watching me
since I was an infant.

299
00:17:59,203 --> 00:18:00,871
So, you must know what I really am.

300
00:18:00,954 --> 00:18:02,331
Where I came from.

301
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,293
Answer me.

302
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:10,255
It is true. You are not of Etheria.

303
00:18:11,465 --> 00:18:13,217
Why didn't you tell me?

304
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:14,384
Explain.

305
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:18,305
Why are you asking about events
in your own memory bank?

306
00:18:18,388 --> 00:18:19,890
My what?

307
00:18:19,973 --> 00:18:24,228
Why are you asking for the clarification
of events you witnessed?

308
00:18:24,311 --> 00:18:25,729
I was a baby.

309
00:18:25,896 --> 00:18:28,107
Babies don't remember things.

310
00:18:28,816 --> 00:18:31,485
Interesting. I shall make a note of this.

311
00:18:31,568 --> 00:18:34,279
Light Hope, where did I come from?

312
00:18:36,657 --> 00:18:37,783
[gasps]

313
00:18:42,037 --> 00:18:45,082
[Light Hope] This is the portal
that you came through, Adora.

314
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:50,087
[baby crying]

315
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:55,509
The Horde stole you,
turned you into a soldier for their war.

316
00:18:55,592 --> 00:18:56,927
I could not stop them.

317
00:18:58,637 --> 00:19:02,891
So, I watched and waited for the day
I could unite you with the Sword.

318
00:19:04,852 --> 00:19:05,686
The Sword.

319
00:19:06,687 --> 00:19:08,063
These powers.

320
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:11,066
The First Ones came from beyond the stars.

321
00:19:11,608 --> 00:19:16,280
They made the sword so that it would only
respond to one of their own kind.

322
00:19:16,697 --> 00:19:17,531
I'm...

323
00:19:18,031 --> 00:19:19,408
I'm a First One?

324
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:22,035
You are upset. I do not understand.

325
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:23,996
Did I have a family? Could I go back?

326
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:26,373
A portal brought me here,
could a portal take me...

327
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:28,250
home?

328
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:31,211
When Mara cut us off
from the rest of the universe,

329
00:19:31,295 --> 00:19:33,755
she destroyed our portal capabilities.

330
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:38,093
Attempting to open one now
would have devastating consequences.

331
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:41,346
Mara. She must have come
from the same place I did.

332
00:19:41,972 --> 00:19:44,266
-Why did she do it?
-It is irrelevant.

333
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:46,727
This is your home now. As She-Ra, you--

334
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:48,645
You aren't listening to me.

335
00:19:48,729 --> 00:19:52,191
You are behaving erratically.
To bear the power of She-Ra is an honor.

336
00:19:52,274 --> 00:19:54,943
Don't I get a say in what happens to me?

337
00:19:55,485 --> 00:19:57,154
Don't I get a choice?

338
00:19:57,237 --> 00:19:59,156
No. This is your destiny.

339
00:19:59,406 --> 00:20:00,574
You do not choose.

340
00:20:00,657 --> 00:20:02,034
You were chosen.

341
00:20:03,911 --> 00:20:05,162
Adora.

342
00:20:05,579 --> 00:20:06,413
Adora.

343
00:20:06,788 --> 00:20:07,998
Where are you going?

344
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:11,001
It is happening again.

345
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:14,171
[Glimmer] We shouldn't
have let her talk to Adora.

346
00:20:14,254 --> 00:20:16,924
I can't even imagine
what she must be feeling.

347
00:20:17,507 --> 00:20:20,135
-Ah. Adora.
-[Bow] Are you okay?

348
00:20:21,178 --> 00:20:24,640
I'm not sure yet.
But I think I know what I have to do.

349
00:20:24,806 --> 00:20:27,517
My whole life,
people have been hiding the truth from me.

350
00:20:27,601 --> 00:20:29,937
So, I'm gonna look for answers myself.

351
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:33,106
Mara started all of this
when she stranded Etheria.

352
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:36,026
She's the only clue we have
about portals, and...

353
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:37,694
And me.

354
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:42,324
I'm going to the Crimson Waste.
I'm going to follow the message from Mara.

355
00:20:42,407 --> 00:20:45,244
I know it's incredibly dangerous,
but this is my choice.

356
00:20:45,619 --> 00:20:49,373
-You don't have to come with me.
-Adora. Of course we're going with you.

357
00:20:49,539 --> 00:20:52,751
You think you could get us to stay behind
if you tried?

358
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:55,545
[all chuckling]

359
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:14,940
I want you all to watch and learn.

360
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:18,026
There is nothing I do not know.

361
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:23,198
Nothing I am not willing to do
to punish those who betray my trust.

362
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:27,452
Your former Force Captain has proven
to be compromised,

363
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:30,872
ineffective, and worthless.

364
00:21:31,164 --> 00:21:32,165
[Hordak groans]

365
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:35,669
To the rest of you,
take a lesson from this.

366
00:21:36,003 --> 00:21:39,214
This is what happens to failures.

367
00:21:40,674 --> 00:21:41,800
You're the failure.

368
00:21:41,883 --> 00:21:42,968
[all gasping]

369
00:21:43,635 --> 00:21:45,512
[Catra laughing]

370
00:21:46,013 --> 00:21:49,474
You need me,
just like you needed Shadow Weaver,

371
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:52,728
because you have no idea
how to run this place.

372
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:56,023
All you know how to do
is hide in your lab.

373
00:21:56,690 --> 00:22:00,152
Maybe that's why you can't
defeat a group of teenagers.

374
00:22:00,235 --> 00:22:01,111
[gasps]

375
00:22:01,528 --> 00:22:02,696
Catra.

376
00:22:02,821 --> 00:22:03,697
[grunts]

377
00:22:05,198 --> 00:22:07,284
Save your little speech.

378
00:22:07,659 --> 00:22:10,329
There has been a change of plan.

379
00:22:10,871 --> 00:22:14,541
Hi, Catra.
I saved your life. You're welcome.

380
00:22:14,624 --> 00:22:16,335
-[chuckles]
-I don't understand.

381
00:22:16,418 --> 00:22:19,212
Entrapta has interceded on your behalf.

382
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:20,964
You should be thanking her.

383
00:22:21,048 --> 00:22:23,884
Instead
of the many punishments I intended,

384
00:22:24,301 --> 00:22:28,013
you are being sent
to retrieve First Ones tech for us

385
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:30,098
in the Crimson Waste.

386
00:22:30,891 --> 00:22:32,225
The Crimson Waste?

387
00:22:32,726 --> 00:22:35,353
It's a total dead zone.
Nothing survives out there.

388
00:22:35,896 --> 00:22:36,897
[laughs]

389
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:38,690
Exactly.

390
00:22:39,066 --> 00:22:40,025
[gasps]
