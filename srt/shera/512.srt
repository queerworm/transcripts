Bow, could you stop playing that thing?

00:01:04,397 --> 00:01:05,815
Hey, I'm still learning.

-Well, I like it.
-Hey...

11
00:01:10,945 --> 00:01:12,947
Prime is getting closer every day

12
00:01:13,031 --> 00:01:15,325
to figuring out how to access
the Heart of Etheria.

13
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:20,747
<i>If he succeeds, he can use it</i>

15

16
00:01:26,586 --> 00:01:28,546

17
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:31,591

18
00:01:31,674 --> 00:01:34,803
<i>If we don't free them now,</i>
<i>we might lose them forever.</i>

19
00:01:35,345 --> 00:01:37,847
Prime holds every advantage in this fight.

20
00:01:38,389 --> 00:01:42,101
He'll be ready for us.
But we have a plan. Entrapta?

21
00:01:42,352 --> 00:01:45,563
I finally succeeded
in cracking Prime's signal pattern.

22
00:01:45,647 --> 00:01:49,984
If I get access to his Spire network,
I can broadcast a jamming frequency

23
00:01:50,068 --> 00:01:53,822
that will disable all of the chips
on Etheria, freeing everyone at once!

24
00:01:53,905 --> 00:01:55,907
I need you all
to get Entrapta to the Spire

25
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:59,285
and keep Prime's forces distracted
while she jams the signal.

26
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:04,541
I'm gonna take the Failsafe to the Heart
and destroy it, once and for all.

27
00:02:04,624 --> 00:02:08,378
We're going to make sure that Prime
can never hurt anyone again.

28
00:02:08,711 --> 00:02:11,214
We're ending this today. For good.

You weren't trying to sneak out
without us, were you?

-Any sign of Catra?
-She's not coming back.

Are you sure you should come?

38
00:02:44,289 --> 00:02:48,209
We don't know what to expect from the
Heart of Etheria. It could be dangerous.

39
00:02:48,293 --> 00:02:50,712
There's no way
we're letting you do this on your own.

-Where's Adora?
-She... She left us.

176
00:15:02,192 --> 00:15:04,403
She's headed to the Heart on her own.

Of course she's gone!

Catra, what is going on?

180
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:15,205
Horde Prime is onto you.
He's hacking into the planet.

181
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:17,791
All of this is from him.

182
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:21,712
-He's gonna take the Heart.
-That's not all. He's got Entrapta.

183
00:15:22,087 --> 00:15:26,216
If Prime has Entrapta, that means
the other princesses are still chipped.

-We have to get back up there.
-We can't just leave Adora!

-Catra...
-[Catra] I can't lose her again, okay?

187

I promised her a long time ago
that I'd look out for her.

188
00:15:39,688 --> 00:15:41,482
It's time I made good on that.

Take care of her, Horde scum.

That's the plan, Sparkles.

And good luck.

I never wanted to die.

I sacrificed myself
so you would never have to.

Why are you doing this, Adora?

This is what I'm supposed to do.

You're worth more than what you can give
