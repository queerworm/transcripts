1
00:00:17,392 --> 00:00:18,977
Council, we're looking for plans

2
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:21,312
to strengthen our defenses
against the Horde.

3
00:00:21,896 --> 00:00:26,067
{\an8}-Who would like to go first?
-Me, me, me. Me. Me, me.

4
00:00:26,234 --> 00:00:28,570
{\an8}Who besides Glimmer
would like to go first?

5
00:00:28,987 --> 00:00:31,531
{\an8}Mom-- Uh, Your Majesty.

6
00:00:31,614 --> 00:00:36,202
{\an8}You should let me, Bow and Adora continue
our princess recruitment mission.

7
00:00:36,286 --> 00:00:38,204
{\an8}If we can form a new Princess Alliance,

8
00:00:38,288 --> 00:00:40,874
{\an8}the Rebellion would actually
stand a chance for once.

9
00:00:40,957 --> 00:00:43,168
{\an8}The princesses withdrew
from the last alliance.

10
00:00:43,251 --> 00:00:45,795
{\an8}They chose to focus
on protecting their lands.

11
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:50,050
{\an8}So, are we supposed to just give up?
Please, let me try.

12
00:00:50,133 --> 00:00:53,178
{\an8}All I'm proposing is a diplomatic mission.

13
00:00:53,678 --> 00:00:55,263
{\an8}So, what do you propose?

14
00:00:55,972 --> 00:00:57,640
Anyone approaching Bright Moon by sea

15
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:59,726
needs to pass
through the Salineas Sea Gate.

16
00:00:59,809 --> 00:01:02,687
{\an8}It's controlled by Princess Mermista
now that her father's retired.

17
00:01:02,771 --> 00:01:05,315
{\an8}With her on our side,
the Rebellion could control the seas.

18
00:01:05,398 --> 00:01:07,525
We need this alliance with her, Mom.

19
00:01:08,485 --> 00:01:11,112
The journey is treacherous, Glimmer.
I'm not sure.

20
00:01:11,196 --> 00:01:15,450
Don't worry, Mom.
With She-Ra, we can conquer anything.

21
00:01:15,533 --> 00:01:17,368
Uh, we're also gonna need a boat.

22
00:01:17,452 --> 00:01:21,081
With She-Ra and a boat,
we can conquer anything.

23
00:01:21,164 --> 00:01:24,793
-And an experienced sea captain.
-[grumbles]

24
00:01:24,876 --> 00:01:28,963
With She-Ra, a boat,
and an experienced sea captain,

25
00:01:29,047 --> 00:01:31,174
we can conquer anything.

26
00:01:31,257 --> 00:01:32,509
[Angella] Very well.

27
00:01:32,592 --> 00:01:34,260
[gasps] Yes.

28
00:01:35,428 --> 00:01:39,099
I mean it, Glimmer.
No violence, and no collateral damage.

29
00:01:39,182 --> 00:01:40,850
Thanks, Mom, you won't regret it.

30
00:01:41,851 --> 00:01:43,019

[laughing]

42
00:02:25,186 --> 00:02:26,020
Go fish.

43
00:02:27,605 --> 00:02:31,693
This is so cool.
Seaworthy is just like I imagined it.

44
00:02:31,776 --> 00:02:35,029
-Everyone here looks like a pirate.
-Focus, Bow.

45
00:02:35,113 --> 00:02:38,491
-We're here to find a sea captain.
-No pirates?

46
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:40,660
-No pirates.
-Arr.

47
00:02:40,743 --> 00:02:43,538
None of these people look qualified
to sail a ship.

48
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:46,499
Excuse me. [chuckles]

49
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:52,422
Uh, we're looking for a sea captain
to take us to Salineas.

50
00:02:53,423 --> 00:02:55,008
[grunting]

51
00:02:56,551 --> 00:03:00,972
[Sea Hawk] I won. Drinks all around.
Put it on my friend here's tab.

52
00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:02,765
Uh, hi.

53
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:07,979
-We were told you're a sea captain?
-I am the one and only Sea Hawk.

54
00:03:08,813 --> 00:03:13,193
-Has my reputation preceded me?
-Your name is Sea Hawk?

55
00:03:13,276 --> 00:03:15,778
That's the coolest name I've ever heard!

56
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:17,280
Captain Sea Hawk,

57
00:03:17,363 --> 00:03:20,158
we're interviewing potential captains
to take us to Salineas.

58
00:03:20,241 --> 00:03:22,660
-Would you like to apply for the position?
-[laughing]

59
00:03:24,537 --> 00:03:28,416
Apply for the position?
I am the one and only Sea Hawk.

60
00:03:28,499 --> 00:03:30,668
-I'm offer only.
-Okay.

61
00:03:30,752 --> 00:03:32,170
Just because "Sea" is in your name,

62
00:03:32,253 --> 00:03:35,006
it doesn't tell us anything
about your actual qualifications.

63
00:03:35,089 --> 00:03:39,636
Qualifications? I once ran
the 50-klick Galebreath Gauntlet

64
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:41,512
in less than 20 klicks.

65
00:03:41,596 --> 00:03:45,683
I maneuvered the Serpentine
with nary a chip in the paint of my bow.

66
00:03:45,767 --> 00:03:48,144
My shanties are considered so desirable,

67
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:51,773
that sirens fling themselves
into sea at the sound of them.

68
00:03:51,856 --> 00:03:53,524
And because I can tell you're wondering,

69
00:03:53,608 --> 00:03:56,903
my mustache is naturally shiny.

70
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,780
It is shiny.

71
00:03:59,113 --> 00:04:00,823
You're hired. Ow.

72
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:05,161
Whoa there, kids.
What makes you think you can afford me?

73
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:09,249
I assure you, Captain Sea Hawk,
money is no object.

74
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:11,584
Behold my fee.

75
00:04:13,962 --> 00:04:15,004
[gasps]

76
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:16,589
Money might be an object.

77
00:04:16,673 --> 00:04:19,759
You know what? Fine.
We'll just find another sea captain.

78
00:04:19,842 --> 00:04:21,010
Good luck with that.

79
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:22,387
You won't find another soul

80
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:25,265
who knows the treacherous route
to Salineas as well as I do.

81
00:04:25,348 --> 00:04:30,937
I brave it often to visit my close
personal friend, Princess Mermista.

82
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:33,690
-[gasps] You know her?
-Do I?

83
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:34,774
[Adora laughing]

84
00:04:35,316 --> 00:04:39,195
Okay. Well, here's the deal.
We go one round, winner takes all.

85
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:44,867
You win, we leave you alone. I win,
you take us to Salineas. At no cost.

86
00:04:46,244 --> 00:04:50,373
That's a terrible deal.
But I am undefeated at arm wrestling.

87
00:04:50,456 --> 00:04:52,417
Let me show you how it's done, lassie.

88
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:53,668
[both grunting]

89
00:04:53,751 --> 00:04:57,422
-Go, Adora. Put him in the dirt.
-This is so dumb.

90
00:04:57,505 --> 00:04:59,632
Ha! This is the best you've got?

91
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:03,094
I once beat a Tyrosaur
with biceps the size of my head

92
00:05:03,177 --> 00:05:06,264
in an arm-wrestling match
that lasted two weeks.

93
00:05:06,931 --> 00:05:09,100
-Ha!
-Yeah! [chuckles]

94
00:05:10,018 --> 00:05:15,273
Well, truth be told, I let you win
so as to, ahem, boost your confidence.

95
00:05:15,356 --> 00:05:17,400
I've been wanting
to go to Salineas anyway.

96
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:20,653
Come on, kids, with me!
Forward to adventure!

97
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:27,827
[Shadow Weaver] Adora is in Seaworthy.

98
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:31,122
I'll give you one more chance
to bring her back.

99
00:05:31,205 --> 00:05:35,418
Uh, didn't Hordak just order you
to stop going after Adora?

100
00:05:35,501 --> 00:05:38,129
And who is going to tell him? You?

101
00:05:39,255 --> 00:05:41,382
Fine. About time you start treating me

102
00:05:41,466 --> 00:05:44,469
like a Force Captain anyway.
I'll bring her back.

103
00:05:44,552 --> 00:05:46,012
Not so fast.

104
00:05:46,095 --> 00:05:48,014
You won't be going alone.

105
00:05:48,097 --> 00:05:50,725
You'll be joined by Force Captain Scorpia.

106
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:56,731
-Kitty. Just so you know, I'm a hugger.
-Huh? What?

107
00:05:56,814 --> 00:05:57,982
[grunting]

108
00:05:58,691 --> 00:06:00,485
Is this some kind of joke?

109
00:06:00,568 --> 00:06:04,030
[Shadow Weaver] Scorpia will see
that you are kept in line.

110
00:06:04,113 --> 00:06:06,407
Ugh. Okay, whatever.

111
00:06:06,491 --> 00:06:08,201
You're at least
giving me a vehicle, right?

112
00:06:08,701 --> 00:06:10,036
Something like that.

113
00:06:12,121 --> 00:06:13,122
No.

114
00:06:13,664 --> 00:06:15,083
Not boats.

115
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:20,713
Oh, I just love boats. Don't you?
Wind in your hair, ocean on every side,

116
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:23,966
miles and miles
from the nearest dry land,

117
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:27,136
watery death awaiting
at the slightest mishap.

118
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:29,514
-Man, that's what I call living.
-[shrieks]

119
00:06:29,597 --> 00:06:31,641
Yeah, I'm really gonna need you
to shut up.

120
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:32,892
Aw. You're seasick?

121
00:06:32,975 --> 00:06:34,602
[groaning]

122
00:06:34,685 --> 00:06:38,898
-Just focus on me, okay? It'll help.
-Put me down!

123
00:06:39,273 --> 00:06:40,650
What is wrong with you?

124
00:06:42,693 --> 00:06:45,988
What are you looking at?
Get back to doing boat things.

125
00:06:47,824 --> 00:06:52,203
Welcome aboard
the <i>Dragon's Daughter, Three.</i>

126
00:06:52,286 --> 00:06:54,705
[scoffs] What happened
to the <i>Dragon's Daughters One </i>and <i>Two?</i>

127
00:06:54,789 --> 00:06:57,542
Tragically, they went down in flames.

128
00:06:57,625 --> 00:07:01,129
-How did that happen?
-I set them on fire.

129
00:07:01,212 --> 00:07:04,424
-Adventure!
-Are we sure about this guy?

130
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:06,259
He just needs to get us there.

131
00:07:06,342 --> 00:07:08,845
You'll of course  be expected
to earn your keep

132
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:10,513
by helping out around the ship.

133
00:07:10,596 --> 00:07:14,183
Never fear, I'll teach you
everything you need to know

134
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:15,685
in shanty form.

135
00:07:15,768 --> 00:07:17,520
Oh!

136
00:07:17,603 --> 00:07:18,771
-What are you doing?
-Oh.

137
00:07:18,855 --> 00:07:21,941
I noticed your mainsail wasn't secured,
so I fixed it.

138
00:07:22,024 --> 00:07:25,653
Tying proper knots is a task
that takes years to master.

139
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:28,406
-You did these just now?
-Yes.

140
00:07:28,489 --> 00:07:32,660
<i>Sea Hawk is impressed with my knots.</i>
<i>This is the best day of my life.</i>

141
00:07:32,743 --> 00:07:36,330
Excellent work,
even if it is just beginner's luck.

142
00:07:36,414 --> 00:07:37,832
We'll also need to set a lookout.

143
00:07:38,207 --> 00:07:40,501
Come on, Sparkle, we'll sing a shanty duet

144
00:07:40,585 --> 00:07:43,588
and I'll show you
how to climb the ratlines.

145
00:07:43,671 --> 00:07:46,007
Oh! [gasps]

146
00:07:46,924 --> 00:07:49,302
-Wait, how did she--?
-[Adora] I unfurled the jib.

147
00:07:49,385 --> 00:07:54,682
By yourself? Not even a sailor
as experienced as me could do that.

148
00:07:54,765 --> 00:07:58,769
Oh, so what you're saying is,
I'm better at this than you are?

149
00:07:58,853 --> 00:08:00,855
And the name is Glimmer.

150
00:08:00,938 --> 00:08:05,485
Well, you are a strangely
overqualified crew.

151
00:08:06,068 --> 00:08:08,946
-What do you even need old Sea Hawk for?
-Your map?

152
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,994
Can we focus
on our super important mission here?

153
00:08:15,077 --> 00:08:17,038
More sailing, less shanty-ing.

154
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:19,749
Of course, Shimmer.

155
00:08:19,832 --> 00:08:23,878
A top secret mission from the queen.
I'll get you there straight away.

156
00:08:23,961 --> 00:08:28,549
I'm as excited to see my dearest Mermista
as I know she is to see me.

157
00:08:28,633 --> 00:08:30,343
My name is Glimmer!

158
00:08:30,426 --> 00:08:32,220

00:09:04,627 --> 00:09:05,878
Something's wrong.

169
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:08,506
According to the map,
we're way off-course.

170
00:09:08,589 --> 00:09:10,049
[Bow] Yeah!

171
00:09:11,175 --> 00:09:12,218
-[grunting]
-Whoo!

172
00:09:12,301 --> 00:09:15,429
-Let's go. Go, Adora.
-Yes.

173
00:09:15,513 --> 00:09:17,848
-Yeah!
-Best three out of five.

174
00:09:17,932 --> 00:09:21,936
No. No more arm wrestling.
I spotted a ship graveyard in the distance

175
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:25,273
and we're heading straight for it.
Is anyone worried about this?

176
00:09:25,356 --> 00:09:26,399
[crashing]

177
00:09:26,482 --> 00:09:27,567
What was that?

178
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:30,236
Aha! We're here.

179
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:35,449
[gasps, then yells]

180
00:09:37,618 --> 00:09:42,415
The Serpent of the Sea.
I knew he'd be lurking in these waters.

181
00:09:42,498 --> 00:09:45,001
Wait, you brought us here on purpose?

182
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:51,799
See, I don't just provide transport.
I give you a tale to tell your friends.

183
00:09:51,882 --> 00:09:55,678
Come on, crew,
we're in for a harrowing adventure.

184
00:09:55,761 --> 00:09:57,763
[roaring]

185
00:09:57,847 --> 00:09:59,640
[Adora] For the Honor of Grayskull.

186
00:10:01,225 --> 00:10:02,560
Watch this!

187
00:10:03,894 --> 00:10:05,229
[yelling]

188
00:10:09,984 --> 00:10:12,653
-Is that a normal thing she does?
-Yeah.

189
00:10:12,737 --> 00:10:16,407
-It takes some getting used to.
-Got it. Wait, no.

190
00:10:17,074 --> 00:10:18,242
Let me get this straight.

191
00:10:18,326 --> 00:10:22,580
You steered us into a giant sea serpent
so you could, what, show off?

192
00:10:22,663 --> 00:10:27,209
That was the plan before
your tall friend there stole my thunder!

193
00:10:27,501 --> 00:10:28,794
Unbelievable.

194
00:10:28,878 --> 00:10:31,380
We're trying to save Etheria
and all you care about

195
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:33,174
is whether or not
we're impressed with you?

196
00:10:33,257 --> 00:10:38,054
I need this mission to go right,
or my mom will never give me another!

197
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:42,892
[grunts] Just get us to Salineas.
You've wasted enough of our time.

198
00:10:43,434 --> 00:10:47,980
-Okay. Now I got it. We're all good.
-Adora, get in the boat!

199
00:10:50,775 --> 00:10:54,111
-Why have we stopped?
-Sea Gate is blocking our path.

200
00:10:54,195 --> 00:10:57,156
-There's no way past, Force Captain Catra.
-What?

201
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:59,033
[grunts]

202
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:04,622
Shadow Weaver didn't bother to mention
that there was a massive gate

203
00:11:04,705 --> 00:11:06,374
blocking the way to Seaworthy?

204
00:11:06,457 --> 00:11:08,209
Didn't you learn
about the Salineas Sea Gate

205
00:11:08,292 --> 00:11:10,044
in Force Captain Orientation?

206
00:11:10,127 --> 00:11:14,048
-There's a Force Captain Orientation?
-[Scorpia] Oh, yes, there is.

207
00:11:14,131 --> 00:11:16,133
-[groans]
-[laughing]

208
00:11:16,217 --> 00:11:17,927
All hands on deck!

209
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:19,845
We're finding a way through that gate.

210
00:11:19,929 --> 00:11:22,181
Ooh, impressive captain yell.

211
00:11:28,729 --> 00:11:30,147
Where is everyone?

212
00:11:33,651 --> 00:11:37,822
Hmm. Very odd indeed.
If I know the Princess Mermista,

213
00:11:37,905 --> 00:11:42,576
-and I do, something's amiss.
-Halt! Halt! Halt, I say.

214
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:46,914
Halt.

215
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:50,501
What's your business in Salineas?

216
00:11:50,584 --> 00:11:53,045
We've come to speak
with Princess Mermista.

217
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:57,007
Tell her Sea Hawk is with them.
She'll be excited to see me.

218
00:11:57,091 --> 00:12:01,011
-Ew, who let him back in here?
-[Sea Hawk] Princess.

219
00:12:01,637 --> 00:12:03,305
Oh, it's been too long.

220
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:06,517
I've dreamed of you
night and day since we parted.

221
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,978
Uh-huh. And who are you?

222
00:12:09,645 --> 00:12:12,189
My name is Glimmer of Bright Moon.

223
00:12:12,273 --> 00:12:15,067
We've never met, but our parents
fought in the Rebellion together.

224
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:16,360
Oh, yeah.

225
00:12:16,444 --> 00:12:19,155
I remember hearing
about the old Princess Alliance.

226
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:22,575
My dad said it was a total disaster.

227
00:12:23,534 --> 00:12:25,161
I didn't think it was possible,

228
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:29,081
but your beauty grows greater
with each passing day.

229
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:32,877
Will you quit it? I'm trying
to talk to my new friend Twinkle.

230
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:37,840
-Butler, bring us some <i>hors d'oeuvres.</i>
-Ooh, <i>hors d'oeuvres!</i>

231
00:12:37,923 --> 00:12:41,719
-For everyone but Sea Hawk.
-Your guard is also your butler?

232
00:12:41,802 --> 00:12:44,096
I'm a little understaffed right now.

233
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:46,766
Everybody fled because the gate
is falling apart or whatever.

234
00:12:46,849 --> 00:12:47,683
[all] What?

235
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:52,396
Yeah, I know, right? It figures
I'd inherit a kingdom that's crumbling,

236
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,732
but it's totally fine. I'm handling it.

237
00:12:54,815 --> 00:12:58,903
It's just kind of inconvenient,
because the Horde won't stop attacking us.

238
00:12:58,986 --> 00:13:00,780
Why is the gate falling apart?

239
00:13:00,863 --> 00:13:03,699
I mean, who knows?
But it's getting weaker every day.

240
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:06,577
And if the Horde tries to attack us again,
we're pretty much dead.

241
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:09,038
The Horde is the reason we're here.

242
00:13:09,121 --> 00:13:11,332
We want to rebuild the Princess Alliance.

243
00:13:11,415 --> 00:13:12,958
None of us stand a chance on our own,

244
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:14,752
but we might be able
to stop them together.

245
00:13:14,835 --> 00:13:18,380
[chuckles] Sure, because that
went so great the first time.

246
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:19,924
Why should I help Bright Moon?

247
00:13:20,007 --> 00:13:22,968
It's not like they've ever done
anything to help us.

248
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:24,887
Mermista, if I may.

249
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:27,306
No. No more shanties.

250
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:31,435
Why did you bring him here?
He is so annoying!

251
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:36,065
-I thought you'd said she liked you.
-We have a rich, complicated past.

252
00:13:36,148 --> 00:13:39,235
If by that you mean you got us
kicked out of the Dolphin Social

253
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:42,363
for challenging the doorman
to a duel, then sure.

254
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:44,657
I don't recall doing that.

255
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:48,619
And that time you set our gondola on fire
in the Tunnel of Love.

256
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:50,538
[chuckling]

257
00:13:51,121 --> 00:13:52,623
That I do recall.

258
00:13:56,293 --> 00:13:58,295
This is First Ones' writing.

259
00:13:58,754 --> 00:14:01,465
And who is she again? What is she doing?

260
00:14:01,549 --> 00:14:03,926
That's Adora. She has a magic sword.

261
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:06,554
What does it say?

262
00:14:07,763 --> 00:14:09,890
Uh, it's something about the gate.

263
00:14:09,974 --> 00:14:13,185
The First Ones must've built it.
Looks like the gate gets its power

264
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:14,854
from the Salinean Runestone.

265
00:14:14,937 --> 00:14:16,480
It could be that the gate is failing

266
00:14:16,564 --> 00:14:19,066
because It's losing its connection
to the power source.

267
00:14:19,149 --> 00:14:21,777
-You think you can fix it?
-I can try.

268
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:25,197
Look, Mermista.
You need our help and we need yours.

269
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:29,535
If Adora can repair your gate,
will you consider joining us? Please?

270
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:33,789
[groans] I don't know. I guess.

271
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:35,916
But he has to leave.

272
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,210
But where am I supposed to go?

273
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:41,714
Maybe wait with the boat, okay, buddy?
We'll take care of the gate.

274
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:53,893
[Mermista] I really hope
you know what you're doing.

275
00:14:53,976 --> 00:14:58,063
Uh... Yeah, totally. [chuckles]
I got this.

276
00:14:58,397 --> 00:15:01,317
For the Honor of Grayskull!

277
00:15:04,111 --> 00:15:07,448
Wow. Okay. That's different.

278
00:15:23,547 --> 00:15:25,049
-Is it working?
-[gasps]

279
00:15:26,634 --> 00:15:30,888
Don't distract me.
This is a lot harder than it looks.

280
00:15:30,971 --> 00:15:32,056
[She-Ra grunting]

281
00:15:37,353 --> 00:15:39,563
[yawns] This might take a while.

282
00:15:46,028 --> 00:15:47,738
[groans] Hang on.

283
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:51,825
-Where are you going?
-[gasps]

284
00:15:51,909 --> 00:15:55,287
I'd really appreciate it
if you'd stop doing <i>that.</i>

285
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:58,415
-Are you leaving without us?
-It's for the best.

286
00:15:58,499 --> 00:16:00,167
I'm only getting in your way.

287
00:16:00,584 --> 00:16:04,588
It's time for old Sea Hawk
to be where he belongs, alone.

288
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:10,844
It wasn't always like this.
Where I'm from, I had friends, a crew.

289
00:16:10,928 --> 00:16:14,640
Every day an adventure more daring
than the last.

290
00:16:14,932 --> 00:16:19,019
The fact I kept setting my boats on fire
was considered charming.

291
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:23,399
But here, I can't even get anyone
to take me seriously.

292
00:16:23,941 --> 00:16:28,028
Yeah. I know a little about that.
I can't get anyone

293
00:16:28,112 --> 00:16:30,114
to take me seriously either.

294
00:16:30,531 --> 00:16:32,908
You? But you're a princess.

295
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:34,994
Try being the daughter
of an immortal queen

296
00:16:35,077 --> 00:16:37,121
when your powers are sparkles.

297
00:16:37,204 --> 00:16:38,372
-Glitter...
-Glimmer.

298
00:16:38,455 --> 00:16:43,210
...we've just met, but I can tell
you are a brave and powerful soul.

299
00:16:43,293 --> 00:16:47,214
Anyone who'd underestimate you
would live to sorely regret it.

300
00:16:47,631 --> 00:16:51,969
Thanks, Sea Hawk. And you know what?
You still have friends and a crew.

301
00:16:52,052 --> 00:16:54,138
Reporting for duty, captain.

302
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:03,272
Uh... Adora?

303
00:17:06,066 --> 00:17:08,652
-It's the Horde.
-What?

304
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:16,118
[shouts]

305
00:17:20,998 --> 00:17:24,835
Keep us going full speed.
I've got something more important to do.

306
00:17:25,502 --> 00:17:28,422
-They're coming right for the gate.
-[groaning]

307
00:17:29,006 --> 00:17:31,800
I just need a little more time.
Keep them busy.

308
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:37,848
[grunting]

309
00:17:52,988 --> 00:17:54,406
Oh, come on.

310
00:17:55,657 --> 00:17:57,117
[grunting and shouting]

311
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:13,175
Oh. You're big.

312
00:18:14,009 --> 00:18:14,843
See you.

313
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:16,011
[yelling]

314
00:18:18,889 --> 00:18:19,973
Gotcha.

315
00:18:20,057 --> 00:18:21,308
Sea Hawk.

316
00:18:24,812 --> 00:18:26,605
Bow, are you all right?

317
00:18:27,022 --> 00:18:29,525
That was amazing!

318
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:32,861
Thank you for noticing, Bow.
It was amazing.

319
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:36,698
Nothing's slowing them down.
What do we do?

320
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:37,950
I think I have a plan.

321
00:18:38,033 --> 00:18:40,661
But no one is allowed to tell my mom
about this.

322
00:18:40,744 --> 00:18:42,204
Sea Hawk, I need your help.

323
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:44,957
-I need you to do what you do best.
-What?

324
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:49,378
Set your ship on fire.

325
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:51,088
Yes.

326
00:18:55,592 --> 00:18:56,468
[grunting]

327
00:18:59,388 --> 00:19:01,807
[Catra laughs] Wow.

328
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:05,352
You know, the tiara actually gets stupider
the more I look at it.

329
00:19:05,435 --> 00:19:07,521
Catra, how did you find me?

330
00:19:08,021 --> 00:19:11,400
Did you think it'd be that easy
to escape the Horde?

331
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:14,862
I mean, I always knew you were dumb,
but come on.

332
00:19:14,945 --> 00:19:18,448
What's your plan, insult me
until I decide to rejoin the Horde?

333
00:19:18,532 --> 00:19:21,326
I don't think Shadow Weaver is planning
to give you much of a choice,

334
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:23,745
but, yeah, something like that.

335
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:32,838
Check it out. Looks like with you gone,
I got your promotion.

336
00:19:33,255 --> 00:19:34,590
Congratulations.

337
00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:40,637
Seems like only yesterday this was
the thing you wanted most in the world.

338
00:19:40,721 --> 00:19:42,097
And now you're--

339
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:46,977
[groans] Come on, Adora,
hasn't this all gone on long enough?

340
00:19:47,978 --> 00:19:52,065
I told you before, Catra,
I'm not going back.

341
00:19:53,483 --> 00:19:55,277
[grunting and shouting]

342
00:20:04,786 --> 00:20:09,499
This is what you left me for?
Dress-up games and a light show?

343
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:15,130
And your new best friends are nowhere
to be seen. When did you get so weak?

344
00:20:18,967 --> 00:20:20,010
Whoo!

345
00:20:24,306 --> 00:20:27,559
-Thanks.
-Yeah, whatever, don't mention it.

346
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:33,273
[Sea Hawk] Ha-ha!

347
00:20:37,194 --> 00:20:39,154
[both] Adventure!

348
00:20:40,614 --> 00:20:41,698
What the heck?

349
00:20:44,534 --> 00:20:45,369
[all yelling]

350
00:20:49,873 --> 00:20:51,041
Yeah!

351
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:00,425
[grunting]

352
00:21:15,357 --> 00:21:18,610
[Mermista] Yay, that was cool.
I'm over it, though.

353
00:21:18,694 --> 00:21:19,861
[sighs]

354
00:21:25,909 --> 00:21:29,538
-What do you know? You actually fixed it.
-It's beautiful.

355
00:21:29,621 --> 00:21:32,582
I guess
you're gonna be needing a new ship.

356
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:36,586
[groans] I suppose
you can have one of mine.

357
00:21:38,046 --> 00:21:39,589
[gasping]

358
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:43,385
-She's gorgeous.
-Don't set it on fire.

359
00:21:43,468 --> 00:21:47,556
No promises. But, Princess,
if I might ask for one more favor.

360
00:21:47,639 --> 00:21:50,309
[groans] You're always ruining it.

361
00:21:50,726 --> 00:21:53,729
You should think about joining
Glimmer's Princess Alliance.

362
00:21:53,812 --> 00:21:56,732
She is a brave and strong captain.

363
00:21:56,815 --> 00:22:00,652
With her at the helm, she is sure
to lead the Rebellion to victory.

364
00:22:00,736 --> 00:22:04,281
Aw, Sea Hawk. You even got my name right.

365
00:22:04,531 --> 00:22:06,908
-Okay, I'm in.
-Really?

366
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:10,996
Yeah. The Horde almost destroyed my home.
I wanna help fight them.

367
00:22:11,079 --> 00:22:14,541
Plus, your friend over there can turn
into a 8-foot tall lady with a sword

368
00:22:14,624 --> 00:22:15,834
and I want her on my side.

369
00:22:16,626 --> 00:22:18,920
-Yes, huzzah!
-Yeah! Oh, yes!

370
00:22:19,004 --> 00:22:23,759
-Wow, okay, calm down.
-You won't regret this, I promise.

371
00:22:23,842 --> 00:22:26,720
