I can't believe Entrapta's working
for the Horde.

18
00:01:23,291 --> 00:01:26,461
{\an8}Shadow Weaver messed with her mind.
She must have. Right?

19
00:01:26,544 --> 00:01:29,839
{\an8}I don't know.
She seemed normal when we talked to her.

20
00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:31,549
{\an8}Entrapta-normal, but still,

21
00:01:31,633 --> 00:01:35,428
{\an8}she wants to be with the Horde,
they do have better tech than us.

22
00:01:35,512 --> 00:01:40,016
{\an8}-But we have magic on our side.
-Magic and tech aren't separate things.

23
00:01:40,099 --> 00:01:43,770
{\an8}Entrapta is one of the only people
who really understands that.

24
00:01:43,853 --> 00:01:46,856
{\an8}She got closer to combining them
than anyone else.

25
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:48,650
{\an8}And now she's with the Horde.

26
00:01:51,277 --> 00:01:52,779
Well, who needs Entrapta?

27
00:01:52,862 --> 00:01:57,492
You've got Bow, tech master and premier
member of the Etherian Maker Community.

28
00:01:58,284 --> 00:01:59,994
Ah. [clearing throat]

29
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:01,996
Yeah, uh, meant to do that.

30
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:05,375
[neighing] Ahoy. Ha, ha.
Be there in a sec.

31
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:09,712
Comrades, I spotted buildings ahead.
The outpost is close.

32
00:02:11,923 --> 00:02:15,802
Entrapta made her decision.
We can't change that.

33
00:02:15,885 --> 00:02:18,930
But we can focus on our mission
and help our people.

34
00:02:19,013 --> 00:02:22,433
We lost all contact with the farming
outpost of Alwyn a week ago.

35
00:02:22,517 --> 00:02:26,104
The Horde hasn't been reported
in the area, but we can't be too careful.

36
00:02:26,187 --> 00:02:28,731
They're definitely involved.
They always are.

37
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:30,608
We can handle the Horde.

38
00:02:30,692 --> 00:02:34,946
I don't care if they have Entrapta's
inventions. They're no match for us.

39
00:02:35,029 --> 00:02:37,657
We'll handle this the way we always do.

40
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:39,576
-Brute strength?
-Almost dying?

41
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:43,830
No. And no.
By sticking together and never giving up.

42
00:02:43,913 --> 00:02:47,500
Yeah! Best Friend Quad to the rescue!

43
00:02:48,376 --> 00:02:53,464
Because there's four of us?
Okay, taking that one off the list.

44
00:03:04,183 --> 00:03:05,685
[Entrapta scatting]

45
00:03:10,899 --> 00:03:11,983
Hmm.

46
00:03:25,246 --> 00:03:28,207
Emily, hand me a six-sided hex driver.

47
00:03:36,007 --> 00:03:37,050
[Emily beeps]

48
00:03:38,009 --> 00:03:41,930
[groans] You're right, Emily,
how can we possibly work like this?

49
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:45,725
Uh, hello?

50
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:48,978
Lord Hordak?

51
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:54,192
[Hordak] State your purpose,
Force Captain Catra.

52
00:03:55,985 --> 00:03:58,780
Lord Hordak, I just thought we should, uh,

53
00:03:58,863 --> 00:04:01,324
touch base like you used to
with Shadow Weaver.

54
00:04:01,407 --> 00:04:05,578
-Figured we could establish a check-in--
-So, I'm to understand

55
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:07,997
you've disturbed me for no reason.

56
00:04:08,456 --> 00:04:12,961
Uh, not for no reason. We need to plan
our next move against the Rebellion.

57
00:04:13,044 --> 00:04:16,673
-The Horde's in a better spot than ever--
-Was squandering our advantage

58
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:19,550
while the Whispering Woods regrew
part of your plan?

59
00:04:22,428 --> 00:04:25,431
Was letting yourself get captured?

60
00:04:25,515 --> 00:04:31,980
Etheria's atmosphere has proved to be a
complicating variable in my experiments.

61
00:04:32,063 --> 00:04:33,773
I-- [coughing]

62
00:04:33,856 --> 00:04:36,859
I just removed that variable.

63
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:42,198
Tell me, Force Captain,
how is your breathing?

64
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:43,783
[wheezing]

65
00:04:47,704 --> 00:04:52,166
Pathetic. Just like everything
on this backwards planet.

66
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:56,004
Do you know what the definition
of failure is, Force Captain?

67
00:04:57,672 --> 00:04:59,173
[panting]

68
00:04:59,257 --> 00:05:03,011
Failure is when something
ceases to serve a purpose.

69
00:05:03,094 --> 00:05:06,764
When that happens,
it becomes worthless to me.

70
00:05:06,848 --> 00:05:10,977
Thus far, your performance
has been lacking.

71
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:17,650
I haven't failed yet. No one knows how to
take the princesses down better than me.

72
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:19,277
Trust me and let me do that.

73
00:05:24,407 --> 00:05:29,912
You say you can defeat the Rebellion?
Prove it. You are dismissed.

74
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:34,834
[as Hordak] <i>Pathetic. Pathetic. Pathetic.</i>

75
00:05:37,253 --> 00:05:39,797
Uh, hello? I thought you should know,

76
00:05:39,881 --> 00:05:43,593
I'm sensing something weird
the closer we get to the outpost.

77
00:05:43,676 --> 00:05:47,680
-Weird? Like what?
-I can't describe it. Just weird.

78
00:05:47,764 --> 00:05:48,681
What is this place?

79
00:05:48,765 --> 00:05:53,853
Alwyn is the Rebellion's biggest
supplier of-- Uh, well, supplies.

80
00:05:53,936 --> 00:05:56,856
It's basically one big orchard.
One big, happy--

81
00:05:58,483 --> 00:06:01,110
Incredibly creepy orchard.

82
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:02,528
[Swift Wind bites apple]

83
00:06:03,321 --> 00:06:07,116
What? Creepy apples taste just as good
as normal apples.

84
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,452
The outpost must be up ahead.

85
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:15,958
I don't see any Horde soldiers.
I actually don't see anyone.

86
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:19,879
-Where are they?
-Maybe they're all inside?

87
00:06:19,962 --> 00:06:23,966
Let me take a look. I've upgraded
my tracker pad to detect Horde signals.

88
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:26,636
If they're here,
we'll find them with this.

89
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:29,180
-[tracker humming]
-[Swift Wind shouting]

90
00:06:31,182 --> 00:06:34,977
Oh, man. I must've broken something
during the upgrade.

91
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:37,313
Not to worry. I can fix this.

92
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:42,944
I don't know how to fix this.

93
00:06:43,027 --> 00:06:46,322
It's okay. Whatever's going on here,
we'll solve it.

94
00:06:46,405 --> 00:06:48,157
Nothing gets past us.

95
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:49,242
[grunting]

96
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:55,706
-Even stories about Alwyn being haunted.
-Haunted? Like with ghosts?

97
00:06:55,790 --> 00:07:00,711
It's just stories. And even if it wasn't,
we'd handle them.

98
00:07:00,795 --> 00:07:02,588
No reason to be scared.

99
00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:05,466
Huh. Well, Shadow Weaver
used to tell me about ghosts

100
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:09,512
when I was a kid in the Horde.
Like the story of the Weeping Princess.

101
00:07:09,595 --> 00:07:13,433
A vengeful spirit who roams Etheria
looking for victims.

102
00:07:13,516 --> 00:07:17,603
You know she's coming for you by the
sound of weeping right before she strikes.

103
00:07:17,687 --> 00:07:20,648
-[shouts] What was that?
-What?

104
00:07:20,731 --> 00:07:24,110
I'm not sure, I heard someone. A voice.

105
00:07:24,527 --> 00:07:26,529
-The Weeping Princess?
-No.

106
00:07:26,612 --> 00:07:30,616
Someone's here, I'm sure of it.
We have to find them.

107
00:07:36,372 --> 00:07:37,999
Third Battalion is closest.

108
00:07:38,082 --> 00:07:41,586
If they move on Erelandia,
the Rebellion will have to answer.

109
00:07:41,669 --> 00:07:45,631
Yeah, small problem. Um,
the Third Battalion is refusing to fight.

110
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:49,510
Because they don't have armor.
They put in... Where is it?

111
00:07:49,594 --> 00:07:52,763
Um, six requests for resupply.
Didn't you see these?

112
00:07:52,847 --> 00:07:55,933
I've been a little busy
almost toppling Bright Moon

113
00:07:56,017 --> 00:07:59,061
and coming closer than anyone
to conquering the planet.

114
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:01,689
-Not that anybody seems to care.
-I care.

115
00:08:02,773 --> 00:08:05,818
-Fine. Give them the armor.
-Ah. Okay. Um...

116
00:08:06,235 --> 00:08:10,823
Boy, I'd sure like to do that.
Uh, but the armory is out of armor.

117
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:15,995
-So, have them make more.
-Okay, just gotta find that file.

118
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:21,751
[chuckles] They're just,
they're so slidey, and slippery.

119
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:26,255
How do I defeat the Rebellion
when all I do is this stupid busy work?

120
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:28,674
I bet Shadow Weaver
didn't have to deal with this.

121
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:33,971
These are her files, so, she probably did?
Just saying. That's a guess on my part.

122
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:36,766
-[groans]
-[Entrapta shouts]

00:08:38,476 --> 00:08:40,561
-Hi.
-You're not a prisoner anymore.

125
00:08:40,645 --> 00:08:43,773
-You don't have to sneak around.
-The ducts are faster.

126
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:47,610
I don't have time to waste.
I need a six-sided hex driver right now.

127
00:08:47,693 --> 00:08:50,196
I'm the one who doesn't have time
to waste.

128
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:53,449
Aren't you some kind of genius?
Make do with what you have.

129
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:57,995
Of course I could, but it's the principle.
Use the proper tool for the job.

130
00:08:58,079 --> 00:09:01,332
If you can't help me, it's fine.
I saw one in Hordak's lab.

131
00:09:01,415 --> 00:09:03,251
[hisses, then grunts]

132
00:09:03,334 --> 00:09:05,503
I know you're new to the Fright Zone

133
00:09:05,586 --> 00:09:08,214
and possibly to being around people
in general,

134
00:09:08,297 --> 00:09:11,509
but Hordak isn't somebody to mess with.

135
00:09:11,592 --> 00:09:17,723
Under no circumstances will you go
anywhere near Hordak's sanctum.

136
00:09:18,599 --> 00:09:21,811
Ooh. He calls his lab a sanctum.

137
00:09:21,894 --> 00:09:25,147
-Oh, that is so classy!
-Focus!

138
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:29,652
I need you to promise
that you will stay away from Hordak.

139
00:09:29,735 --> 00:09:32,822
-Promise!
-Okay, okay! I promise.

140
00:09:33,114 --> 00:09:34,615
[Scorpia] Catra. [laughs]

141
00:09:35,199 --> 00:09:36,075
Here it is.

142
00:09:36,158 --> 00:09:41,414
Oh, okay, so the armory can't make
more armor because they are out of irid--

143
00:09:41,497 --> 00:09:43,666
Do-iridul-Ium?

144
00:09:43,749 --> 00:09:45,543
Irideli-- The point is,

145
00:09:45,626 --> 00:09:48,129
they're out of the stuff
they need to make armor.

146
00:09:48,212 --> 00:09:49,088
[sighs]

147
00:09:49,171 --> 00:09:54,010
-So, where do we get more?
-Oh, uh, I don't have a file for that.

148
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:55,803
I'll handle it myself.

149
00:09:55,886 --> 00:10:00,683
But keep an eye on Entrapta,
and make sure she doesn't go near Hordak.

150
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:04,270
Got it, boss.
I won't let her out of my sight.

151
00:10:05,396 --> 00:10:08,816
Now, you didn't happen to see
which way she went, did you?

152
00:10:08,899 --> 00:10:12,570
You know what? I'll figure it out.
I'll figure it out. [laughs]

153
00:10:12,903 --> 00:10:14,405
[sighs]

154
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:23,748
-Hello?
-[yelps]

155
00:10:23,831 --> 00:10:26,334
Uh, I mean, uh, who did that?

156
00:10:26,417 --> 00:10:29,003
Bow, man,
you gotta pull yourself together.

157
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:37,261
I'll wait out here in case
anyone tries to sneak up on you.

158
00:10:37,345 --> 00:10:40,723
Also, this door is too small for horses,
which is rude.

159
00:10:41,515 --> 00:10:43,392
Okay. On three.

160
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:46,604
One, two, three!

161
00:10:46,687 --> 00:10:48,230
[all grunting]

162
00:10:50,733 --> 00:10:51,651
Huh?

163
00:10:53,944 --> 00:10:57,073
The food is cold.
Whoever lives here left in a hurry.

164
00:10:57,156 --> 00:10:59,659
-A while ago.
-There's No sign of the Horde.

165
00:10:59,742 --> 00:11:03,871
There's no sign of a struggle at all.
They just left.

166
00:11:03,954 --> 00:11:07,041
This is just like the story
of the Headless Princess.

167
00:11:07,124 --> 00:11:11,212
She stalks the night, pulling people
out of their beds.

168
00:11:11,295 --> 00:11:14,256
Leaving nothing but bloody footprints.

169
00:11:17,218 --> 00:11:19,345
-[Swift Wind] What'd you find?
-[all shout]

170
00:11:19,428 --> 00:11:22,181
Sorry, I don't like being out here
by myself.

171
00:11:22,973 --> 00:11:25,017
We should check out the other buildings.

172
00:11:35,903 --> 00:11:37,988
-Hey, guys!
-[shouts] Sorry.

173
00:11:38,614 --> 00:11:39,949
What did you say?

174
00:11:41,909 --> 00:11:45,454
-Does that look familiar to you?
-I'm not sure. Maybe--

175
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:47,373
-[banging]
-[all shouting]

176
00:11:51,335 --> 00:11:52,420
Huh.

177
00:11:52,503 --> 00:11:54,338
Uh, Glimmer?

178
00:11:54,422 --> 00:11:55,923
[panting]

179
00:11:56,006 --> 00:12:00,344
-I'm so sorry. No idea why I did that.
-This place is weird.

180
00:12:00,428 --> 00:12:02,763
Like the lair of the Undead Princess.

181
00:12:02,847 --> 00:12:06,600
-Where she lures soldiers to their doom.
-Undead Princess?

182
00:12:06,684 --> 00:12:08,853
The Horde really had a theme, huh?

183
00:12:09,186 --> 00:12:13,023
Oh. You're right. Wow. I can't believe
I'm just realizing this now.

184
00:12:13,107 --> 00:12:14,942
Weird or not, we have a mission.

185
00:12:15,025 --> 00:12:18,404
Something happened here that
forced these people to flee their home.

186
00:12:18,487 --> 00:12:20,364
We have to get to the bottom of this.

187
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:26,245
Ethical dilemma number, uh...

188
00:12:26,328 --> 00:12:27,288
sixty-three.

189
00:12:27,788 --> 00:12:31,208
I told Catra I wouldn't go
into Hordak's lab.

190
00:12:31,292 --> 00:12:34,837
But if she never finds out, does it count?

191
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:38,924
I could just pop in, grab the tool
and pop out.

192
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:41,886
No one would ever know. But I would know.

193
00:12:41,969 --> 00:12:45,389
I shouldn't do it. Or should I?
No, I shouldn't.

194
00:12:46,515 --> 00:12:48,851
A six-sided hex driver.

195
00:12:55,149 --> 00:12:57,359
This is amazing.

196
00:13:02,406 --> 00:13:03,532
Oh.

197
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:05,034
[Hordak shouting]

198
00:13:08,954 --> 00:13:12,917
Well, there's no reason to get huffy
because an experiment failed.

199
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,879
Failure is a vital part
of all scientific endeavor.

200
00:13:16,962 --> 00:13:21,383
What if I had given up on you
after the first explosion? Or the 50th?

201
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:24,720
I know.
I should leave, but I have to stay.

202
00:13:24,803 --> 00:13:26,222
For science.

203
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,603
Huh?

204
00:13:35,356 --> 00:13:37,149
It's totally abandoned.

205
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:38,526
-[shrieking noise]
-Whoa.

206
00:13:38,609 --> 00:13:39,902
Do you guys hear that?

207
00:13:39,985 --> 00:13:43,405
Yes. Finally. I told you.
It's a weird sound.

208
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:47,076
It's like something-- Someone is singing.

209
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:50,663
I don't hear anything.
It's probably just the wind.

210
00:13:50,746 --> 00:13:51,914
[voices whispering]

211
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:54,917
Okay. I'm hearing something, too.

212
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:59,171
There. Someone's there.

213
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:02,299
For the Honor of Grayskull!

214
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:07,054
-Adora!
-Wait!

215
00:14:17,481 --> 00:14:19,233
[groans]

216
00:14:21,068 --> 00:14:26,031
Hello. You're blocking my light.
If you could just step aside...

217
00:14:26,115 --> 00:14:28,117
Get out!

218
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,119
Well, just a sec. I'm almost finished.

219
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:37,418
-All done. Okay, bye.
-There will be dire consequences

220
00:14:37,501 --> 00:14:40,546
for this flagrant breach of conduct.

221
00:14:40,629 --> 00:14:42,339
You were using uninsulated cables.

222
00:14:42,423 --> 00:14:44,508
I, uh, replaced them for you.
Try it again.

223
00:14:44,592 --> 00:14:46,385
It should hold the charge now.

224
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:55,019
Hmm.

225
00:14:57,146 --> 00:14:58,355
Huh?

226
00:14:59,815 --> 00:15:02,818
-She was right.
-[Entrapta] Of course I was right.

227
00:15:04,987 --> 00:15:06,155
[hisses, then laughing]

228
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:09,992
It's beautiful.
It's a power source, isn't it?

229
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:13,287
What are you building
that needs so much power?

230
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:14,705
[grunts]

231
00:15:15,372 --> 00:15:18,125
[gasps] I recognize these formulas!

232
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:20,878
You're experimenting with portals?
But that's--

233
00:15:20,961 --> 00:15:25,716
I mean, I'm familiar with the concept, but
multi-dimensional gates are theoretical.

234
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:29,803
No one's come close
to actually achieving one. Right?

235
00:15:30,387 --> 00:15:34,183
Obviously someone from a backwater planet
such as yours

236
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:36,268
couldn't possibly comprehend it.

237
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:39,772
Hey. All right. I'm the one
who got your power source working,

238
00:15:39,855 --> 00:15:45,069
-so tell me everything.
-Portals aren't theoretical, they're real.

239
00:15:45,152 --> 00:15:46,904
And I'm going to open one.

240
00:15:46,987 --> 00:15:50,324
You are? Ah! Can I help you?

241
00:15:51,033 --> 00:15:56,538
Just think of the possibilities!
You could transport troops, and weapons,

242
00:15:56,622 --> 00:16:00,125
whatever you need,
from one side of the planet to the other!

243
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:02,753
You think too small. Unsurprising.

244
00:16:02,836 --> 00:16:05,422
You can't begin to understand
the potential

245
00:16:05,506 --> 00:16:08,008
a device of this nature will possess.

246
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:16,600
Wait! If Etheria is a backwater planet,
does that mean that there are others?

247
00:16:16,684 --> 00:16:17,935
Of course there are.

248
00:16:18,018 --> 00:16:21,563
There are countless galaxies
filled with countless other worlds.

249
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:24,525
Etheria is the only planet
I've ever encountered

250
00:16:24,608 --> 00:16:28,821
-that does not seem to understand that.
-Other planets?

251
00:16:28,904 --> 00:16:31,198
And you've been there?

252
00:16:32,199 --> 00:16:33,575
Ah...

253
00:16:35,077 --> 00:16:38,080
[Catra] I've contacted every mine
under Horde control.

254
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:42,584
None have the material to make armor.
Without armor, I can't attack Erelandia.

255
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:45,587
You're trying to sabotage me!
Where's the missing file?

256
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:51,719
The material you seek comes from
the foundry right here in the Fright Zone.

257
00:16:53,095 --> 00:16:53,929
Fine.

258
00:16:54,471 --> 00:16:58,767
Being me isn't quite
what you imagined, is it?

259
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:03,647
I suppose you thought Hordak
would let you run things now?

260
00:17:03,731 --> 00:17:06,316
He does. I can do what I want.

261
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:09,903
But he'll never trust you
with his real plans.

262
00:17:09,987 --> 00:17:13,949
Don't take it personally,
he never did with me either.

263
00:17:14,616 --> 00:17:16,952
I don't know what you're talking about.

264
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:20,789
Maybe Hordak didn't trust you,
but he trusts me plenty.

265
00:17:27,463 --> 00:17:29,757
[voices whispering]

266
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:30,966
[all grunting]

267
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:42,978
-The light came from around here.
-[voices laughing]

268
00:17:45,606 --> 00:17:47,399
There! It's over--

269
00:17:48,025 --> 00:17:49,902
[all screaming]

270
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:54,281
-Where'd it go? Did I get it?
-No.

271
00:17:55,491 --> 00:17:56,492
Run!

272
00:17:58,869 --> 00:18:01,121
Ah, run the other way!

273
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:08,295
-She-Ra, do something.
-Like what? Flail at them again?

274
00:18:08,378 --> 00:18:11,757
I can handle the Horde,
I can't handle this! This is like--

275
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:15,761
Stop telling ghost stories!
I've been terrified since we got here!

276
00:18:15,844 --> 00:18:18,806
Catra was right, I'm terrible at this!

277
00:18:18,889 --> 00:18:22,518
I can't replace Entrapta!
I can't even make my tracker pad work!

278
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:26,688
And I'm still hearing stuff coming
from the big, stone pointy thing.

279
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:28,524
From the pointy-- Hold on.

280
00:18:31,985 --> 00:18:34,321
What are you doing? Bow!

281
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:35,823
[grunts]

282
00:18:35,906 --> 00:18:36,949
[shouting]

283
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:45,457
Of course.
This place, it's a First Ones ruin.

284
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:48,544
These aren't ghosts, they're holograms.

285
00:18:48,627 --> 00:18:51,630
I'm sure holograms can't walk
around on their own.

286
00:18:51,713 --> 00:18:53,757
Look at them. Really look at them.

287
00:18:53,841 --> 00:18:56,468
-No, thanks, I'm good!
-They're running in some loop.

288
00:18:56,552 --> 00:18:58,804
[She-Ra] It's-- It's like a recording.

289
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:06,228
[gasps]

290
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:09,398
Aw, she's waving.

291
00:19:11,733 --> 00:19:14,528
Actually, you know what,
it's still creepy.

292
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:18,866
I think I know where they're coming from.
Come on.

293
00:19:19,908 --> 00:19:22,744
Catra. Catra. Hey, Catra.

294
00:19:22,953 --> 00:19:24,329
-[groans]
-Oh, wow.

295
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:28,500
You are fast. Anyway, I found the file.
And guess what?

296
00:19:28,584 --> 00:19:31,461
The material is produced
here in the Fright Zone?

297
00:19:31,545 --> 00:19:33,213
Beautiful and brilliant.

298
00:19:34,631 --> 00:19:36,925
Where's Entrapta?
You're supposed to watch her!

299
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:38,802
You know, she is--

300
00:19:38,886 --> 00:19:41,513
She's-- I don't know where she is.

301
00:19:41,597 --> 00:19:43,432
Truthfully. But I'm gonna fix that,

302
00:19:43,515 --> 00:19:47,019
because that's the kind of friend I am.
So, you're welcome.

303
00:19:55,777 --> 00:19:59,239
This is probably the max with what
you've got to work with here.

304
00:19:59,323 --> 00:20:03,118
If we had some First Ones tech,
we could generate even more voltage.

305
00:20:05,245 --> 00:20:10,667
I'm sorry, Lord Hordak! Entrapta is new.
I promise she will never bother you again.

306
00:20:10,751 --> 00:20:13,712
You are the one bothering me,
Force Captain,

307
00:20:13,795 --> 00:20:15,881
with your unwelcome intrusion.

308
00:20:15,964 --> 00:20:18,967
I am working.

309
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:21,386
With Entrapta's assistance.

310
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:26,183
Did you hear that, Emily?
I've never had a lab partner before.

311
00:20:29,811 --> 00:20:31,063
[hisses]

312
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:34,149
[groans]

313
00:20:40,989 --> 00:20:43,533
This is it. The noise is coming from here.

314
00:20:43,617 --> 00:20:45,535
It looks like Light Hope's Beacon.

315
00:20:45,619 --> 00:20:46,954
It's an antenna.

316
00:20:47,037 --> 00:20:51,708
I'm guessing this outpost is built on
some kind of First Ones communication hub.

317
00:20:51,792 --> 00:20:54,044
When the Black Garnet
disrupted the planet,

318
00:20:54,127 --> 00:20:58,799
it must've caused the hub to power up,
it's trying to send old stored messages.

319
00:20:58,882 --> 00:21:02,177
With you translating,
we should be able to turn it off.

320
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:03,178
[grunting]

321
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:05,639
So, these are First Ones?

322
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:09,226
Yeah. Why?

323
00:21:09,309 --> 00:21:14,731
It's just I've been thinking of them
as these big, epic figures.

324
00:21:14,815 --> 00:21:19,194
But they're regular people,
sending messages to their loved ones.

325
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:23,699
Messages that were never received
because of what Mara did to the planet.

326
00:21:35,502 --> 00:21:36,962
Be at rest now.

327
00:21:38,422 --> 00:21:42,759
The farmers must've fled from the
ghosts when this thing turned itself on.

328
00:21:42,843 --> 00:21:46,013
We should get them a message
that it's safe to return.

329
00:21:46,096 --> 00:21:50,892
Way to go. The Rebellion is going to do
just fine with you, Master Maker Bow.

330
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:54,187
Thanks, Glimmer. Now that the antenna
is powered down,

331
00:21:54,271 --> 00:21:56,189
everything should be back to normal.

332
00:21:57,649 --> 00:21:59,526
