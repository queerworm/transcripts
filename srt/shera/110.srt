{\an8}-Adora, it's not your fault.
-It is my fault.

{\an8}Entrapta's gone because of my plan.

5
00:00:33,491 --> 00:00:36,119
{\an8}This only happened
because we were all together.

6
00:00:36,202 --> 00:00:39,622
{\an8}Mermista's right, being together
makes us vulnerable.

7
00:00:40,081 --> 00:00:43,334
{\an8}Maybe there's a reason
the Princess Alliance fell apart before.

8
00:00:43,418 --> 00:00:46,046
{\an8}Maybe this whole thing was a bad idea.

00:00:46,129 --> 00:00:48,173
Mermista, no, you can't say that.

-She'll know what to do.
-No.

Glimmer, Shadow Weaver did something
to your powers. You can't teleport and,

I don't want my mom freaking out
any more than she already is. Okay?

56
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:04,786
Besides, I always feel better
after I recharge, so...

Then it's agreed.
I'll recharge, stop glitching.

[Hordak] Not only did you lose
the princess known as Glimmer,

60

but I learned that you've known
Adora was She-Ra all along.

it was so important to bring her back.

[Hordak] All you did

63
00:04:28,142 --> 00:04:33,481
was invite attack from an enemy combatant

Shadow Weaver made with the black garnet.

118
00:07:45,214 --> 00:07:49,469

She-Ra healed the trees in Plumeria.

Uh... Sort of, not really.

Well, She-Ra definitely fixed
the Sea Gate.

Glimmer's not machinery.

No offense.

This is a great idea.

125
00:08:06,194 --> 00:08:09,155
She-Ra will fix me, and then everything
will be back to normal.

I know her name, I was just...

132
00:08:31,093 --> 00:08:35,431
Ugh, never mind. Lord Hordak himself
tasked me with your interrogation.

133
00:08:35,765 --> 00:08:37,808
So, there's no use resisting.

134
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:44,565
I don't care what it takes.

135
00:08:44,815 --> 00:08:48,861
I'm going to drag

138
00:08:54,158 --> 00:08:55,952
Fascinating.

139
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:57,286
Give it back.

140
00:08:57,787 --> 00:09:02,833
-Oh, I like that thing. Can I have it?
-No. And stop. I'm interrogating you.

141
00:09:02,917 --> 00:09:04,752
Okay, then. What do you want to know?

142
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:07,755
Why were you hiding out
in the Fright Zone?

143
00:09:07,838 --> 00:09:11,634
I was waiting for my friends to get back.
They had trouble finding me before.

144
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:15,388
So, I figured I'd make it easier for them
and just stay put right here.

145
00:09:15,596 --> 00:09:16,430
They left you.

146
00:09:16,806 --> 00:09:19,350
No, no, they're my friends,
they'll be back.

147
00:09:19,433 --> 00:09:23,729
Say, your tail secretes some kind
of paralyzing agent, right?

148
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:26,440
Do you think
I could have a sample, to study?

149
00:09:26,524 --> 00:09:29,652
Hey, you can't touch
another woman's tail without asking!

150
00:09:31,445 --> 00:09:34,949
Some friends. They left you,
and they're not coming back.

151
00:09:35,449 --> 00:09:36,951
Isn't that just like Adora?

152
00:09:37,493 --> 00:09:40,162
She left me behind, too.
Like I was nothing.

153
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:43,874
And me. I mean, I didn't want to go,
but she could've at least asked.

154
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:46,711
Adora got her precious Bow
and Glimmer back.

155
00:09:46,794 --> 00:09:50,631
All these princesses care about
is people who are just like them.

156

00:09:58,514 --> 00:09:59,473
Is that right?

159
00:09:59,557 --> 00:10:02,768
I don't know if that's right,
it was hard to tell in the walls.

160

Hour 45, that's--

161
00:10:04,645 --> 00:10:06,147
That's too many hours.

162
00:10:06,731 --> 00:10:09,400
This angry feline person
seems to be correct.

163
00:10:10,526 --> 00:10:12,320
They're not coming back for me.

164
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:18,200
You wouldn't have to be pretend
to be something you're not with the Horde.

165
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:23,080
Think of what you could accomplish here.
What we could accomplish, together.

166
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:28,544
I've made more progress
on my work in secret here

167
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:31,464
than I did in a whole non-secret life
out there.

168
00:10:31,714 --> 00:10:35,176
They should see. Horde technology
gives me so much to work with.

I've ever built.

170
00:10:37,553 --> 00:10:38,554
Wait, who's Emily?

171
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:41,390
Oh! How rude, allow me to introduce you.

172
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:45,853
[Scorpia grunts]
I gotcha, I gotcha, I gotcha.

173
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:55,071
Those princesses have no idea
who they've left behind.

174
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:01,952
Ooh!

175
00:11:04,872 --> 00:11:08,042
The... Eternia... heal!

176
00:11:08,876 --> 00:11:11,087
Heal...

177
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:12,755
Glimmer.

178
00:11:12,838 --> 00:11:16,008
Who's ready to stop messing around
with sharp objects? Hey, look, I am!

179
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:19,887
-Maybe if you point it at me?
-Or, unpopular opinion,

180
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:22,264
don't point a sword
directly at our friend.

181
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:24,100
It's fine, I got this.

182
00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:28,354
Maybe it's like a motion.
Like a jabbing motion? Or a strike.

183
00:11:28,437 --> 00:11:30,606
Do you want to get hit with a sword?

184
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:33,275
Can everyone please be quiet? I have it!

185
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:34,652
[grunts]

186
00:11:36,612 --> 00:11:40,282
Am I the only one who cares
about sword safety around here?

187
00:11:41,325 --> 00:11:43,452
[gasps] I think it's working.

188
00:11:45,496 --> 00:11:49,291
Yup, definitely working.
I'm pretty sure I feel something.

189
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:50,209
[shouting]

190
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:53,963
[grunts]

191
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:56,465
[Bow] Sword safety!

192
00:12:08,602 --> 00:12:11,230
Honestly, I don't think
anybody's gonna notice. Oh.

193
00:12:11,313 --> 00:12:13,482
Sorry again. About the wall.

194
00:12:14,275 --> 00:12:18,112
-Don't worry about it.
-You're not mad? People usually get mad.

195
00:12:18,487 --> 00:12:20,990
Are you kidding? I'm impressed.

196
00:12:21,157 --> 00:12:24,201
You rebuilt that robot, I mean Emily,

197
00:12:24,285 --> 00:12:27,413
all on your own?
While living in the vents?

198
00:12:27,496 --> 00:12:31,250
Sure did. Not only that,
but she's better than ever.

199
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:36,255
Stronger, increased weapons capabilities,
and affectionate, too.

200
00:12:37,673 --> 00:12:40,926
Who knows how much more powerful
she could be if I just had access

201
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:45,181
to a little First Ones tech.
You don't have any here, do you?

202
00:12:45,556 --> 00:12:47,475
-First what?
-First Ones tech.

203
00:12:47,558 --> 00:12:50,603
You know, advanced technology
left behind by a lost civilization?

204
00:12:50,686 --> 00:12:53,272
Makes our modern innovations
look like children's toys?

205
00:12:53,355 --> 00:12:55,858
I've been attempting to integrate
First Ones tech

206
00:12:55,941 --> 00:12:57,443
into my experiments for years,

207
00:12:57,526 --> 00:13:00,613
but my understanding
of their code is still rudimentary.

208
00:13:00,696 --> 00:13:02,907
If I could just find the key
to their language,

209
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:04,909
there's no telling what I could build.

210
00:13:04,992 --> 00:13:09,455
Such a find could yield
almost unlimited power. [laughing]

211
00:13:09,872 --> 00:13:12,124
And where would one find this tech?

212
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:16,545
It's buried all over the planet.
It gives off a signal that can be traced.

213
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:21,050
Lately, I've been tracking
the strongest signal I've ever seen.

214
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:23,719
It must be a massive stash.

215
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:25,387
-Where?
-[Scorpia] Ugh.

216
00:13:26,972 --> 00:13:28,808
Huh. [chuckles]

217
00:13:29,391 --> 00:13:30,976
I mean, uh, where?

218
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:34,772
I've triangulated the signal
to somewhere in the Whispering Woods.

219
00:13:34,855 --> 00:13:38,859
The whole shifting landscape thing
makes for a complicated variable,

220
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:42,530
but I've created a map
that's accurate within two quadrants.

221
00:13:42,613 --> 00:13:44,240
How do I get my hands on this map?

222
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:48,077
Like any good scientist,
I carry everything I need on my person.

223
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,411
[Catra grunting]

224
00:14:00,464 --> 00:14:03,843
I'm not sure if we can trust her yet.
But if she's telling the truth,

225
00:14:03,926 --> 00:14:06,804
this could give us a huge advantage
over the Rebellion.

226
00:14:07,137 --> 00:14:09,431
Hordak will finally see
how much more valuable I am

227
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:10,432
than Shadow Weaver.

228
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:14,228
I bet he'll promote you to...
What comes after Force Captain?

229
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:17,231
Keep an eye on Entrapta
while I go see if this pans out.

230
00:14:17,314 --> 00:14:20,985
I hope it does,
I wanna build something big.

231
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:26,407
Oh, sorry, my bad.

232
00:14:28,576 --> 00:14:31,954
Which hair part was in which thingy?

233
00:14:32,997 --> 00:14:35,833
What good am I
if I can't even heal one princess?

234
00:14:37,459 --> 00:14:39,503
[grunts] Why even carry a sword?

235
00:14:39,587 --> 00:14:41,255
-[knocking on door]
-[gasps]

236
00:14:42,923 --> 00:14:45,301
Everybody, just act normal.

237
00:14:47,678 --> 00:14:49,096
Mom, we're busy.

238
00:14:49,179 --> 00:14:53,100
I won't be long. You are requested
for dinner with me tonight. Alone.

239
00:14:53,517 --> 00:14:55,060
But Mom!

240
00:14:55,603 --> 00:14:58,939
I'm really tired.
Can't I just stay in my room and rest?

241
00:14:59,023 --> 00:15:01,942
I'm sorry,
I don't know why I said request.

242
00:15:02,026 --> 00:15:05,571
It's not a request.
You are required to have dinner with me

243
00:15:05,654 --> 00:15:07,531
because I'm your mother and...

244
00:15:07,615 --> 00:15:09,617
I'm also the queen, so I can make you.

245
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:12,745
Yikes. She's playing the queen card.

246
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,915
No need to answer.
I'll see you in an hour.

247
00:15:16,248 --> 00:15:17,791
[shouting]

248
00:15:21,462 --> 00:15:24,673
That's it. I can't stay here
and be useless. Bow is right.

249
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:29,803
-I don't know how to use my powers.
-I didn't say that. Or not that exactly.

250
00:15:29,887 --> 00:15:33,182
The Horde has a lot of things wrong.
Okay, pretty much everything.

251
00:15:33,265 --> 00:15:35,684
But one thing they are right about
is training.

252
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:38,771
And how can I train
if I don't know anything about She-Ra?

253
00:15:38,854 --> 00:15:43,108
I'm going to go somewhere I can learn.
And then I'm gonna fix you, Glimmer.

254
00:15:43,192 --> 00:15:45,194
[gasps] How? Can you do it in an hour?

255
00:15:45,277 --> 00:15:47,738
Probably not,
since I'm not sure where I'm going.

256
00:15:47,821 --> 00:15:50,032
I need to find the place
Madame Razz took me.

257
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:51,700
It's some sort of beacon.

258
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:54,453
I can't explain it,
but I know I can get answers there.

259
00:15:54,536 --> 00:15:58,207
Running away. Great idea.
I won't have to go to dinner with my mom.

260
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:01,460
-I'll get my things.
-No, I have to do this on my own.

261
00:16:02,419 --> 00:16:03,295
[shouts]

262
00:16:03,837 --> 00:16:06,465
-[Adora crashes] Ow.
-She's okay.

263
00:16:06,882 --> 00:16:08,884
I hope she stays that way.

264
00:16:13,931 --> 00:16:16,642
-Going somewhere?
-Like I'd tell you.

265
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:18,477
I've got a lead on something big,

266
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,896
and I'm not about to let you
take all the credit again.

267
00:16:21,146 --> 00:16:23,649
Not that it worked out
so great for you last time.

268
00:16:24,358 --> 00:16:25,651
[breathing heavily]

269
00:16:26,902 --> 00:16:28,779
Don't worry about that thing with Hordak.

270
00:16:28,862 --> 00:16:31,323
I've got loads of experience
being yelled at.

271
00:16:31,407 --> 00:16:34,576
Mostly by you, actually.
You get used to it.

272
00:16:35,703 --> 00:16:39,164
I will not get used
to mediocrity like you.

273
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:41,583
And I certainly don't need your pity.

274
00:16:44,795 --> 00:16:49,133
I was hard on you, I won't deny it.
And I won't apologize.

275
00:16:49,216 --> 00:16:52,553
I just wanted to prepare you
for the world.

276
00:16:52,636 --> 00:16:55,264
I wanted you to be strong.

277
00:16:56,974 --> 00:17:00,644
Yeah, well, congratulations,
I'm plenty strong now.

278
00:17:00,728 --> 00:17:02,021
And I don't need you.

279
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:06,942
[Bow] <i>Listen, Glimmer,</i>

280
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:10,487
I appreciate you trying,
but you can't protect me anymore.

281
00:17:10,571 --> 00:17:12,114
We have to tell your mom.

282
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:16,535
We're not telling anybody's mom!
And what do you mean, protect you?

283
00:17:16,618 --> 00:17:19,329
Isn't it obvious? This is all my fault!

284
00:17:19,663 --> 00:17:23,333
If I hadn't gone to prom with Perfuma,
we wouldn't have been separated.

285
00:17:23,417 --> 00:17:25,878
I wouldn't have gotten kidnapped,
and you wouldn't be sick.

286
00:17:25,961 --> 00:17:27,755
See? All my fault!

287
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:31,300
That's crazy! It's obviously my fault!

288
00:17:31,383 --> 00:17:33,177
I let myself get distracted.

289
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:36,430
I shouldn't have been so weird
about you hanging out with someone else.

290
00:17:36,513 --> 00:17:37,848
I'm sorry, Bow.

291
00:17:38,849 --> 00:17:41,602
You can't be sorry
when I'm trying to be sorry.

292
00:17:42,603 --> 00:17:44,938
But your sorry is wrong
and mine is right.

293
00:17:45,522 --> 00:17:47,024
You know what? Let's just hug.

294
00:17:50,277 --> 00:17:51,570
[grunting]

295
00:17:52,821 --> 00:17:56,825
-I'm glitching, aren't I?
-It hurts so much.

296
00:17:58,452 --> 00:18:01,538
How am I gonna get through dinner
without my mom noticing?

297
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:05,292
Ah. Ooh. We start a fire,
then she'll have to cancel.

298
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:08,587
Just a small one?

299
00:18:10,464 --> 00:18:12,257
It was definitely this way.

300
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:13,967
I think.

301
00:18:15,677 --> 00:18:17,012
[grunting]

302
00:18:19,973 --> 00:18:20,808
Oh!

303
00:18:22,059 --> 00:18:23,560
That rock looks familiar.

304
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:27,731
[sighs] Because I passed it an hour ago.

305
00:18:35,739 --> 00:18:38,492
I gave the staff the night off
so it could be just us.

306
00:18:38,575 --> 00:18:40,285
And I made your favorite.

307
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:44,331
Well, I didn't make it,
but I had the kitchen make it

308
00:18:44,414 --> 00:18:45,749
before I gave them the night off.

309
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:47,334
Thanks.

310
00:18:47,417 --> 00:18:50,170
We've hardly had a chance to talk
since you returned.

311
00:18:50,254 --> 00:18:52,548
Well, you know, not much to talk about.

312
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:55,425
Not much to talk about?
You were kidnapped!

313
00:18:55,884 --> 00:18:58,387
And you lost a friend
during the escape and--

314
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:00,514
I get it, Mom. I failed.

315
00:19:00,597 --> 00:19:02,307
-That's not what I--
-[shouting]

316
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:05,769
Stop! Make it stop!

317
00:19:05,853 --> 00:19:09,189
Glimmer, what's happening to you?
What aren't you telling me?

318
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:12,651
Don't yell at me!
I know I messed everything up, okay?

319
00:19:12,734 --> 00:19:16,446
-I know I'm a big disappointment.
-What are you talking about?

320
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:19,783
Entrapta died trying to rescue me,
the Princess Alliance is over,

321
00:19:19,867 --> 00:19:22,536
and Shadow Weaver did something
to my powers!

322
00:19:22,619 --> 00:19:25,080
I'm sorry I couldn't be perfect like you.

323
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:28,625
You have no idea
what it feels like to be such a screwup!

324
00:19:28,709 --> 00:19:31,753
I don't know how you feel?
I got your father killed!

325
00:19:35,215 --> 00:19:37,885
I ordered the battle
your father perished in.

326
00:19:38,802 --> 00:19:42,181
-I've never forgiven myself.
-I-- I didn't know that.

327
00:19:42,389 --> 00:19:44,808
Yes, well, you never talk to me.

328
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:49,146
-Why didn't you tell me you were sick?
-Because I was ashamed.

329
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:50,981
I acted without thinking,

330
00:19:51,064 --> 00:19:54,109
the exact thing
you're always telling me not to do.

331
00:19:54,443 --> 00:19:57,362
I teleported right into their trap.

332
00:19:58,155 --> 00:20:01,325
The Alliance is over, and I'm to blame.

333
00:20:01,783 --> 00:20:05,370
Oh, Glimmer, I'm the one who failed.

334
00:20:05,954 --> 00:20:09,666
If I hadn't let the first Alliance
fall apart after your father died,

335
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:11,543
none of this would be happening.

336
00:20:11,627 --> 00:20:13,754
You feel like a failure?

337
00:20:14,004 --> 00:20:16,048
Don't make the same mistake I did.

338
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:19,801
I should have kept fighting.
And you should, too.

339
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:22,971
But the other princesses, they all quit.

340
00:20:23,639 --> 00:20:27,726
-You don't think the Rebellion is done?
-With my daughter leading it?

341
00:20:27,809 --> 00:20:29,436
Not a chance.

342
00:20:29,811 --> 00:20:31,730
Even if my powers are gone?

343
00:20:31,813 --> 00:20:34,316
We'll figure it out. Together.

344
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:45,994
[voices whispering]

345
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:52,167
[grumbles]

346
00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:05,847
[grunts] This thing is useless.

347
00:21:12,813 --> 00:21:16,066
No. But I've been walking
in a straight line!

348
00:21:16,149 --> 00:21:17,276
[grunts]

349
00:21:17,776 --> 00:21:20,362
I'm trying to help!
Why are you stopping me?

350
00:21:24,241 --> 00:21:25,367
[grunting]

351
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:26,827
[gasps]

352
00:21:27,744 --> 00:21:28,870
[grumbles, then yells]

353
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:32,624
I should've known better
than to trust a princess.

354
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:35,043
[voices whispering]

355
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:37,713
Hmm?

356
00:21:38,422 --> 00:21:39,298
[shudders]

357
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:41,717
[whining]

358
00:21:43,093 --> 00:21:47,639
Just let me fix this. Please, I--
I can't let anyone else get hurt.

359
00:21:52,227 --> 00:21:54,187
Fine. You win.

360
00:21:55,689 --> 00:22:00,944
You want me to be weak?
Well, I am. And I'm afraid.

361
00:22:01,403 --> 00:22:03,655
Because I'm no good at any of this.

362
00:22:06,908 --> 00:22:07,909
[gasps]

363
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:18,086
[grunting and shouting]

364
00:22:21,923 --> 00:22:26,219
I'll never find this magical tech.
If it even existed in the first place.

365
00:22:29,931 --> 00:22:31,475
On second thought.

366
00:22:36,229 --> 00:22:37,564
[Catra chuckles]

367
00:22:38,523 --> 00:22:39,649
Hey, Adora.
