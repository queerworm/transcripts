00:00:19,394 --> 00:00:21,771
[Shadow Weaver] Maintain the connection.

2
00:00:21,855 --> 00:00:23,106
That's right.

3
00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:24,065
Stay focused.

4
00:00:24,149 --> 00:00:26,234
Does this usually take so long?

5
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:29,362
{\an8}I never require this much rehearsal.

6
00:00:29,446 --> 00:00:31,781
{\an8}Maybe sorcery just isn't your calling.

7
00:00:33,074 --> 00:00:36,327
{\an8}[Shadow Weaver]
Do not allow them to distract you.

8
00:00:36,411 --> 00:00:37,579
[grunting]

9
00:00:41,791 --> 00:00:42,625
{\an8}I did it.

10
00:00:43,626 --> 00:00:45,045
{\an8}I mean, of course I did.

11
00:00:45,545 --> 00:00:48,339
{\an8}It's a truth spell.
Don't bother fighting it.

12
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:51,968
{\an8}Just tell me everything you know
about the Horde's plans.

13
00:00:52,051 --> 00:00:53,011
[groaning]

14
00:00:54,429 --> 00:00:55,263
Yes.

15
00:00:55,513 --> 00:00:57,182
I can resist no longer.

16
00:00:57,807 --> 00:01:00,226
I shall tell you the truth.

17
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:01,436
The truth is...

18
00:01:03,188 --> 00:01:05,607
that outfit really isn't working for you.

19
00:01:05,982 --> 00:01:08,526
Oh, and magic isn't either.

20
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:09,694
[groans]

21
00:01:10,111 --> 00:01:12,447
Aw. Your little spell failed.

22
00:01:12,614 --> 00:01:15,033
You believed my performance, though.
I can tell.

23
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,451
It's called acting.

24
00:01:16,743 --> 00:01:18,411
That's the real magic here.

25
00:01:18,495 --> 00:01:19,913
-Ugh.
-Your Majesty.

26
00:01:19,996 --> 00:01:23,083
Adora has returned and called a meeting
of the Princess Alliance.

27
00:01:23,166 --> 00:01:25,919
-Adora's back?
-Adora called a meeting?

28
00:01:26,002 --> 00:01:27,087
Can she do that?

29
00:01:27,212 --> 00:01:28,922
I thought you were the queen.

30
00:01:29,798 --> 00:01:32,759
I guess I should be working
on my Adora impression.

31
00:01:32,884 --> 00:01:34,677
She's clearly the leader here.

32
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:35,804
Hmm.

33
00:01:36,304 --> 00:01:37,764
Is the hair poof high enough?

34
00:01:37,847 --> 00:01:39,015
[groaning]

35
00:01:43,895 --> 00:01:46,648
<i>♪ We're on the edge of greatness ♪</i>

36
00:01:47,524 --> 00:01:49,818

00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:11,256
<i>♪ We must be strong ♪</i>

45
00:02:25,353 --> 00:02:27,188
That's really going to happen?

46
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:28,481
To Etheria?

47
00:02:28,773 --> 00:02:29,983
To-- To us?

48
00:02:31,317 --> 00:02:34,737
The Heart of Etheria
nearly destroyed everyone in Mara's time.

49
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:38,408
And it's gotten stronger,
more volatile over the centuries.

50
00:02:38,491 --> 00:02:40,535
If it goes off now...

51
00:02:41,327 --> 00:02:43,955
We have to make sure
it never goes off again.

52
00:02:44,539 --> 00:02:45,790
[groaning]

53
00:02:46,958 --> 00:02:48,543
So, how do we stop it?

54
00:02:48,626 --> 00:02:50,044
[Shadow Weaver] Stop it?

55
00:02:52,589 --> 00:02:56,801
The real question
is how do you intend to use this

56
00:02:56,885 --> 00:02:58,678
to your advantage?

57
00:02:58,761 --> 00:03:01,347
Uh, we're not. You saw the simulation.

58
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:02,849
We have to disable it.

59
00:03:02,932 --> 00:03:05,018
[Shadow Weaver] And throw away such power?

60
00:03:05,101 --> 00:03:07,478
Perhaps the First Ones were fools

61
00:03:07,562 --> 00:03:11,608
for storing so much raw energy
at the heart of the planet.

62
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:13,484
But now that it's there...

63
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:16,696
What if there was a way
to channel that magic ourselves?

64
00:03:16,779 --> 00:03:20,909
[Shadow Weaver] The princesses
are powerful, but with that magic

65
00:03:20,992 --> 00:03:22,911
they would be unstoppable.

66
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:25,330
We'd be supercharged.

67
00:03:25,496 --> 00:03:27,332
We could take down the Horde.

68
00:03:27,415 --> 00:03:29,834
Are you seriously considering this?

69
00:03:29,918 --> 00:03:30,835
You heard Bow.

70
00:03:31,002 --> 00:03:32,712
It's an unstable superweapon.

71
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,797
Tampering with it is way too dangerous.

72
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:36,215
Dangerous?

73
00:03:36,424 --> 00:03:39,093
Every day,
the Horde claims more territory.

74
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:43,681
We're running out of options.

75
00:03:44,557 --> 00:03:48,061
So I say we get Light Hope to tell us
how it works,

76
00:03:48,144 --> 00:03:49,687
and take our power back.

77
00:03:50,271 --> 00:03:52,732
All she wants is to set the weapon off.

78
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:56,903
-Are you even listening to us?
-Okay. Five-minute break.

79
00:04:14,128 --> 00:04:15,713
[gasps] Scorpia?

80
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:20,343
[groans]

81
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:22,095
[door opens]

82
00:04:22,178 --> 00:04:23,221
Finally.

83
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:28,935
What are you doing?

84
00:04:29,018 --> 00:04:30,311
We just got back.

85
00:04:30,395 --> 00:04:33,356
The Eastern Quadrant is secured.
No rebel activity.

86
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:36,609
While you were out in the field,
did you see anyone?

87
00:04:36,818 --> 00:04:38,361
Anything else?

88
00:04:38,444 --> 00:04:40,363
Just lots of tired soldiers.

89
00:04:40,446 --> 00:04:44,450
-Get back out there, then.
-Catra, we already worked a double.

90
00:04:44,534 --> 00:04:47,287
We've been going
without R and R for days now.

91
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:48,371
We need sleep.

92
00:04:48,454 --> 00:04:51,249
Oh, I'm sorry, are you tired?

93
00:04:53,501 --> 00:04:55,545
We're all tired,
but we're not going to rest

94
00:04:55,628 --> 00:04:58,006
until we have all of Etheria
under our control.

95
00:04:58,089 --> 00:05:01,259
Everything is finally coming together.
We're winning.

96
00:05:01,384 --> 00:05:03,136
So, get back out there.

97
00:05:05,638 --> 00:05:06,973
Problem?

98
00:05:19,694 --> 00:05:20,945
[yawning]

99
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:23,906
[grunts]

100
00:05:29,954 --> 00:05:33,291
-I know we've lost a lot, but we can't--
-Lost a lot?

101
00:05:33,374 --> 00:05:36,878
Elberon, Thaymor, Alwyn, Salineas.

102
00:05:37,128 --> 00:05:39,130
We've lost almost everything.

103
00:05:39,213 --> 00:05:43,051
This magic is the only thing
that can help us save everyone.

104
00:05:46,637 --> 00:05:48,598
Use the scary magical energy.

105
00:05:48,723 --> 00:05:51,184
Don't use the scary magical energy.

106
00:05:53,686 --> 00:05:54,896
[shouting]

107
00:05:55,396 --> 00:05:58,024
Maybe we should continue this
in the morning?

108
00:05:58,357 --> 00:06:00,276
Not that I'm up past my bedtime.

109
00:06:00,359 --> 00:06:03,696
I don't have a bedtime.
I can go to bed whenever I want.

110
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:05,698
Or we can just decide right now.

111
00:06:06,324 --> 00:06:09,243
I'll do whatever it takes
to get my kingdom back.

112
00:06:09,327 --> 00:06:11,120
I say we use the magic.

113
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:15,750
Oh, it's so dangerous. What if it goes off
in the process? Oh, I don't know.

114
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:19,212
Just come back to me. Use the scary
magic or don't use the scary magic.

115
00:06:19,295 --> 00:06:22,465
How come I still don't have a chair
even though the new person does?

116
00:06:22,548 --> 00:06:24,425
Oh, no. I'm sitting on Emily.

117
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:27,678
Swift Wind, is this really the time to...?

118
00:06:28,096 --> 00:06:28,930
Uh...

119
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:34,811
Hey, everybody. How are you?

120
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:37,480
Gosh, I am so sorry
for popping in unannounced.

121
00:06:37,563 --> 00:06:38,856
I didn't wanna interrupt.

122
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:42,068
You all seemed really busy,
so I snuck past the guards

123
00:06:42,151 --> 00:06:44,695
and was just waiting for you guys
to notice I was here--

124
00:06:44,779 --> 00:06:45,863
Horde soldier!

125
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,200
For the honor of Grayskull!

126
00:06:52,203 --> 00:06:54,163
No. Do-- Hold on! Hold on!

127
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:55,832
I don't wanna fight you.

128
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:57,875
She's got a bot!

129
00:06:57,959 --> 00:06:59,877
For Salineas!

130
00:07:00,628 --> 00:07:01,879
[Scorpia] Wait!

131
00:07:03,422 --> 00:07:05,299
You ruined Princess Prom!

132
00:07:06,634 --> 00:07:07,802
[gasps]

133
00:07:13,641 --> 00:07:14,600
[shouting]

134
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:21,941
No, wait! Wait, wait, wait! No.

135
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:33,703
Please! I don't wanna hurt you.

136
00:07:33,786 --> 00:07:35,621
I think she's telling the tru--

137
00:07:35,705 --> 00:07:37,123
[groaning]

138
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:40,001
[all gasp and shout]

139
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,087
I am so sorry.
I did not to mean to do that.

140
00:07:43,254 --> 00:07:44,797
It's instinct. It--

141
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:45,840
Uh-oh.

142
00:07:47,175 --> 00:07:49,927
Please! I need your help to save Entrapta!

143
00:08:07,403 --> 00:08:08,571
[laughing nearby]

144
00:08:08,654 --> 00:08:10,865
Scorpia? I knew you'd come--

145
00:08:14,619 --> 00:08:16,496
[groans] Get it together!

146
00:08:26,464 --> 00:08:27,381
[hisses]

147
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:32,178
Okay, no.
There's no way we're working a fourth--

148
00:08:32,261 --> 00:08:33,137
[grunts]

149
00:08:35,389 --> 00:08:36,641
[grunts]

150
00:08:36,724 --> 00:08:39,310
-What are they saying?
-What? Who?

151
00:08:39,393 --> 00:08:41,896
Don't pretend like you don't know.

152
00:08:41,979 --> 00:08:43,481
Are they laughing at me?

153
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:47,151
Mostly people are just tired.

154
00:08:47,235 --> 00:08:50,780
I think if you let them sleep,
everything will be fine.

155
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:52,532
Everything isn't fine.

156
00:08:52,615 --> 00:08:54,659
Scorpia would be here
if everything was fine.

157
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:59,205
-[growls]
-[gasps]

158
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:03,793
[laughing]

159
00:09:04,335 --> 00:09:06,420
Just leave. Like everybody else.

160
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:09,715
Go!

161
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:18,015
Double Trouble. Are you there?

162
00:09:20,601 --> 00:09:21,852
Come on.

163
00:09:22,436 --> 00:09:23,479
Answer me!

164
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:26,983
[shouts]

165
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:32,947
Again, I am so sorry
about the whole stinging thing.

166
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,074
[grunts]

167
00:09:37,743 --> 00:09:39,453
-All right, Horde soldier.
-Hmm?

168
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:40,705
Why are you here?

169
00:09:43,124 --> 00:09:45,585
Heh. Are you listening to me?

170
00:09:45,668 --> 00:09:48,588
Well... Yeah, but just-- Shadow Weaver.

171
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:51,382
And at Bright Moon.
Everything is making so much sense

172
00:09:51,465 --> 00:09:53,676
about why Catra's been acting
the way she has.

173
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:56,304
And now I left.
Oh, that's gonna do a real number on her.

174
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:58,598
Hey. Answer the question.

175
00:09:58,681 --> 00:09:59,682
Right. Sorry.

176
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:02,143
The thing is you all seem really good
at friendship.

177
00:10:02,226 --> 00:10:05,146
You're here to learn
how to be a good friend?

178
00:10:05,229 --> 00:10:06,397
Yes. That's it.

179
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,733
See, I thought I was being a good friend
to Catra,

180
00:10:08,816 --> 00:10:11,319
but it turns out
Catra wasn't being a good friend to me,

181
00:10:11,402 --> 00:10:13,738
and also that I have no idea
what friendship is.

182
00:10:13,821 --> 00:10:16,449
Man, I think Entrapta's
the only real friend I've ever had.

183
00:10:17,074 --> 00:10:18,284
[Emily beeping]

184
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:19,994
And Emily.

185
00:10:20,828 --> 00:10:22,079
-[giggles]
-[groans]

186
00:10:22,163 --> 00:10:24,248
Say things that make sense.

187
00:10:24,332 --> 00:10:26,709
Right. Okay.
Entrapta wanted to warn Hordak

188
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:29,795
about the whole, you know,
portal weirdness thing,

189
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:32,673
so Catra sent her to Beast Island,
and I...

190
00:10:33,758 --> 00:10:34,717
I let it happen.

191
00:10:35,259 --> 00:10:37,845
-Now I have to save her.
-[Adora gasps]

192
00:10:38,095 --> 00:10:39,347
Beast Island?

193
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:40,723
With the blood beetles?

194
00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:43,643
And trees with razor-sharp blades
instead of leaves? It's real?

195
00:10:43,726 --> 00:10:46,395
[Shadow Weaver]
Oh, yes. But it's much worse than that.

196
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:50,316
We told you those children's stories
so you wouldn't be scared.

197
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:51,567
It's worse?

198
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:53,486
Oh, what have I done?

199
00:10:53,569 --> 00:10:55,154
We can't leave her there.

200
00:10:55,237 --> 00:10:59,158
If we wanna safely disable the weapon,
Entrapta's our best bet.

201
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:01,494
-She'd know more about that than anyone.
-Wait--

202
00:11:01,577 --> 00:11:04,497
We have to get to Beast Island right away,
save Entrapta,

203
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:07,124
-shut down the Heart of Etheria for good.
-Hold on.

204
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:08,751
-I'm in.
-No, you're not-- What?

205
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:11,754
Me, too.
Obviously, I mean, I brought this to you.

206
00:11:11,837 --> 00:11:16,676
-Great, then it's decided. We're going--
-Will everyone just stop for one second?

207
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:19,762
You aren't going anywhere.

208
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:21,430
You're our prisoner.

209
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:24,266
And you! We need to talk about this.

210
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:25,684
Now!

211
00:11:28,312 --> 00:11:29,146
Stop it.

212
00:11:29,313 --> 00:11:32,650
Stop just trying to barrel ahead
with your own plans.

213
00:11:32,733 --> 00:11:34,485
We have to talk about this.

214
00:11:34,568 --> 00:11:35,986
What's there to talk about?

215
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:38,322
Entrapta needs our help,
and we need Entrapta.

216
00:11:38,406 --> 00:11:42,660
Adora, have you ever heard of anyone
coming back from Beast Island?

217
00:11:42,743 --> 00:11:46,288
-Do you even know where it is?
-No. But we have to try.

218
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:49,166
Oh, great plan.
The Horde's on our doorstep

219
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:52,795
and we'll just drop everything to run off
on a harebrained rescue mission.

220
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:55,923
Glimmer, you do want to save Entrapta,
right?

221
00:11:56,006 --> 00:11:58,551
Of course I do. We'll save her.

222
00:11:59,009 --> 00:12:01,137
But we need to stop the Horde first.

223
00:12:01,303 --> 00:12:04,557
I won't risk the whole Alliance
for one princess who betrayed us.

224
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:08,769
There's an unstable mass of magic
in the middle of the planet.

225
00:12:08,978 --> 00:12:10,104
Everyone's at risk

226
00:12:10,187 --> 00:12:12,398
unless we can get Entrapta
to shut it down.

227
00:12:12,481 --> 00:12:16,902
Entrapta has a habit of exploding
everything she touches.

228
00:12:16,986 --> 00:12:19,321
You really wanna let her near this thing?

229
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:21,157
Just go to Light Hope and ask her.

230
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:24,493
If we can get some
of that stored power back, we could use it

231
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:26,454
to defeat the Horde and save Entrapta.

232
00:12:26,537 --> 00:12:28,122
What? No.

233
00:12:28,205 --> 00:12:31,709
I told you, we can't trust her.
She betrayed Mara.

234
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:33,002
She lied to me.

235
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:34,545
She's the bad guy!

236
00:12:34,628 --> 00:12:38,799
The Horde are the bad guys.
And you don't have to tell her everything.

237
00:12:38,883 --> 00:12:41,051
Just find out how it works
and how to access it.

238
00:12:41,135 --> 00:12:43,554
And if it goes wrong?
People could get hurt.

239
00:12:43,637 --> 00:12:45,139
Bow.

240
00:12:45,222 --> 00:12:48,476
You understand what I'm trying to say,
tell her.

241
00:12:51,979 --> 00:12:54,023
No. You weren't there.

242
00:12:54,106 --> 00:12:55,566
We need Entrapta.

243
00:12:55,816 --> 00:12:57,610
We need to disable the weapon.

244
00:12:57,693 --> 00:12:59,612
Why can't you trust me in this?

245
00:12:59,695 --> 00:13:01,197
Because you're wrong!

246
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:08,329
[Glimmer] You think I'm wrong?

247
00:13:09,413 --> 00:13:10,372
Fine.

248
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:12,666
But I am still queen.

249
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,711
And as queen I am ordering you.

250
00:13:15,794 --> 00:13:18,088
No one is going to Beast Island.

251
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:22,301
You're not to set foot outside the castle
unless I say so.

252
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:24,720
End of discussion.

253
00:13:29,016 --> 00:13:30,309
[gasps] Oh.

254
00:13:30,726 --> 00:13:32,520
-[grunting]
-[laughs]

255
00:13:34,605 --> 00:13:35,606
[gasps]

256
00:13:42,947 --> 00:13:46,158
Ha, ha. Hang-- Hang on.
I get to stay here?

257
00:13:46,242 --> 00:13:48,744
This is the only other spare room we have.

258
00:13:48,827 --> 00:13:52,206
But don't go thinking it's a sleepover.
We're guarding you.

259
00:13:52,289 --> 00:13:54,250
I brought snacks.

260
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:57,336
Thought you might be hungry
after your journey.

261
00:13:57,962 --> 00:13:59,046
[Scorpia chuckles]

262
00:13:59,129 --> 00:14:01,674
Okay. What is that?
Why is it green and not bar-shaped?

263
00:14:01,757 --> 00:14:05,344
Are you trying to poison me?
And if not, why are you being so nice?

264
00:14:05,427 --> 00:14:08,681
It's green
because it's a vegetable, silly.

265
00:14:09,139 --> 00:14:11,767
Do they not have those in the Horde?

266
00:14:13,769 --> 00:14:17,273
Oh. Well, okay,
you should definitely be eating them.

267
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:19,650
And we're being nice
because you're our guest.

268
00:14:19,733 --> 00:14:20,568
[Frosta] Prisoner.

269
00:14:20,651 --> 00:14:23,028
I said it's not a sleepo--

270
00:14:23,112 --> 00:14:25,447
I'll get pillows. Be right back. Aah!

271
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:26,407
[groans]

272
00:14:34,748 --> 00:14:35,916
Oh. Mm-mm.

273
00:14:38,627 --> 00:14:40,754
Blah, blah, blah.

274
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:43,257
[Emily beeping]

275
00:14:48,012 --> 00:14:49,430
Wh-- What?

276
00:14:49,513 --> 00:14:51,599
Wh-- What?

277
00:14:52,474 --> 00:14:54,143
How strong are your pincers?

278
00:14:54,226 --> 00:14:56,353
Can you crush things or just cut?

279
00:14:56,437 --> 00:14:59,231
Oh, you know,
they're good for general pincing.

280
00:14:59,315 --> 00:15:01,734
And cutting through basically everything.

281
00:15:02,359 --> 00:15:03,235
Really?

282
00:15:03,694 --> 00:15:04,862
I gotta try that.

283
00:15:07,031 --> 00:15:08,198
[shouts]

284
00:15:08,824 --> 00:15:10,367
[crying]

285
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:13,746
Oh.

286
00:15:13,829 --> 00:15:14,663
Are you--?

287
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:17,958
Are you crying?
Is it because I made ice pincers?

288
00:15:18,042 --> 00:15:20,419
I'm sorry. They're your thing. I get it.

289
00:15:20,502 --> 00:15:22,880
No, it's not that.

290
00:15:23,797 --> 00:15:27,468
The Horde always told me I was different,
that I wouldn't fit in with you all,

291
00:15:27,551 --> 00:15:30,054
but you're making me feel
the opposite of not belonging,

292
00:15:30,137 --> 00:15:32,389
which I guess is belonging?

293
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:35,768
I used to feel that way, too.

294
00:15:36,185 --> 00:15:42,399
And then I met Glimmer and the others,
and I realized that none of us fit in.

295
00:15:42,483 --> 00:15:44,944
We're all different, but that's okay.

296
00:15:45,569 --> 00:15:49,073
That might be the nicest thing
anyone's ever said to me.

297
00:15:49,156 --> 00:15:51,158
Well, don't get used to it.

298
00:15:51,408 --> 00:15:52,952
You're still our prisoner.

299
00:15:54,662 --> 00:15:59,667
But I've got first watch,
so I'll be up, if you wanna talk more.

300
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:05,839
[Hordak] <i>I've taken the last</i>
<i>of the coastal towns.</i>

301
00:16:05,923 --> 00:16:07,508
<i>What is the status in the Woods?</i>

302
00:16:07,591 --> 00:16:09,760
Our raiding parties
have crushed the villages

303
00:16:09,843 --> 00:16:11,345
near our current outpost.

304
00:16:11,553 --> 00:16:13,639
Tomorrow, we move farther inland.

305
00:16:14,014 --> 00:16:16,100
Everything is under control.

306
00:16:16,183 --> 00:16:17,184
<i>Excellent.</i>

307
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:20,562
<i>Etheria will be ours yet.</i>

308
00:16:26,026 --> 00:16:27,027
[sighs]

309
00:16:29,947 --> 00:16:30,906
[crying]

310
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:44,336
I've never lied to Glimmer before.
I mean, it's not "lying" lying.

311
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:45,462
I left a note.

312
00:16:45,546 --> 00:16:47,631
Three, actually. But still.

313
00:16:47,715 --> 00:16:49,216
We're doing the right thing.

314
00:16:49,299 --> 00:16:52,011
We can't let what happened in Mara's time
ever happen again.

315
00:16:52,094 --> 00:16:55,639
And Glimmer's gonna be angry at us,
but at least she'll be around to be angry.

316
00:17:00,102 --> 00:17:02,021
Do you think I should leave another note?

317
00:17:02,146 --> 00:17:05,524
We're kind of sneaking out here.
You think you could keep it down a little?

318
00:17:05,607 --> 00:17:07,443
-Sorry.
-[Swift Wind] Hey, Adora!

319
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:11,447
I kicked open the last barn door I could
and I am now ready to go!

320
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:12,489
Shh.

321
00:17:12,614 --> 00:17:14,450
Swifty, you gotta keep it down.

322
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,827
What's happening?

323
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:19,288
Uh... You're asleep?

324
00:17:19,747 --> 00:17:21,498
Yeah, you're asleep.

325
00:17:21,665 --> 00:17:22,750
This is a dream.

326
00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:24,918
A dream.

327
00:17:25,085 --> 00:17:28,172
Yes. The flying unicorn dream.

328
00:17:28,422 --> 00:17:29,715
Classic.

329
00:17:29,798 --> 00:17:31,467
I know what you're doing.

330
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:32,885
[both gasp]

331
00:17:34,595 --> 00:17:35,804
And you better hurry.

332
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:38,265
You're--? You're not gonna stop us?

333
00:17:38,348 --> 00:17:41,685
I didn't join the Princess Alliance
just to fight.

334
00:17:42,102 --> 00:17:44,104
I joined to save people.

335
00:17:44,188 --> 00:17:46,857
And the Horde,
even after everything they did...

336
00:17:48,108 --> 00:17:50,527
they're people, just like us.

337
00:17:50,611 --> 00:17:53,572
I'll cover for you,
but you have to go now.

338
00:17:53,655 --> 00:17:55,407
Everyone will be up soon.

339
00:18:21,892 --> 00:18:22,851
[neighs]

340
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:32,486
Should I be doing anything or...?

341
00:18:32,569 --> 00:18:33,737
Um...

342
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:34,780
Not sure.

343
00:18:34,988 --> 00:18:37,491
Gonna be honest,
I've never flown a spaceship.

344
00:18:37,574 --> 00:18:38,826
I know how to fly.

345
00:18:38,909 --> 00:18:42,704
Just have this thing flap its wings.
There's gotta be a flapping wings button.

346
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:44,957
-[Bow] No, no, no!
-Wait, Swifty, don't--

347
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:06,019
[all shouting]

348
00:19:11,775 --> 00:19:13,402
Never mind, that wasn't it.

349
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:27,833
Down's the opposite
of the direction we want!

350
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:29,501
We know that, Swift Wind!

351
00:19:29,585 --> 00:19:31,420
[grunts] Bow! Do something!

352
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:32,546
[groaning]

353
00:19:35,424 --> 00:19:36,758
[all shouting]

354
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:41,805
Loop the loops! How could you betray me?

355
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:45,142
[computer] <i>Administrator detected.</i>

356
00:19:45,225 --> 00:19:46,560
<i>What is your query?</i>

357
00:19:46,643 --> 00:19:47,936
Fly ship!

358
00:19:48,103 --> 00:19:49,229
How to fly ship.

359
00:19:49,313 --> 00:19:51,982
Just take us back down gently!

360
00:19:52,232 --> 00:19:53,150
<i>Acknowledged.</i>

361
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:54,902
<i>Going in reverse.</i>

362
00:19:54,985 --> 00:19:56,195
No, no, no!

363
00:20:06,121 --> 00:20:07,247
[all groaning]

364
00:20:08,415 --> 00:20:09,666
Stop!

365
00:20:16,423 --> 00:20:18,508
-<i>Please state navigational course.</i>
-[shouts]

366
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:23,263
Uh... Beast Island?

367
00:20:23,347 --> 00:20:27,351
<i>Setting coordinates</i>
<i>for Hazardous Materials Disposal Site.</i>

368
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:29,895
<i>Designation, Beast Island.</i>

369
00:20:30,187 --> 00:20:31,605
<i>Coordinates set.</i>

370
00:20:31,688 --> 00:20:34,024
<i>Is any additional assistance required?</i>

371
00:20:34,358 --> 00:20:36,610
Can you maybe fly us there?

372
00:20:36,777 --> 00:20:37,653
<i>Affirmative.</i>

373
00:20:37,945 --> 00:20:39,404
<i>Setting autopilot.</i>

374
00:20:39,821 --> 00:20:40,697
Wow.

375
00:20:40,822 --> 00:20:42,824
That was a lot easier
than I thought it'd be.

376
00:20:43,533 --> 00:20:45,118
[retching]

377
00:20:47,829 --> 00:20:49,289
[Double Trouble] Oh, back again?

378
00:20:49,373 --> 00:20:52,042
You know what they say,
if at first you don't succeed,

379
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:53,627
try, try, try.

380
00:20:54,378 --> 00:20:56,964
How many times have you tried again?

381
00:21:01,385 --> 00:21:03,011
Tell me everything.

382
00:21:04,012 --> 00:21:04,846
I--

383
00:21:05,722 --> 00:21:06,556
I--

384
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,267
I can't cry on cue.

385
00:21:08,475 --> 00:21:09,977
Whenever a role calls for tears,

386
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:12,980
the only thing that works
is thinking about children falling.

387
00:21:13,146 --> 00:21:16,191
They're tears of laughter,
but no one can tell the difference.

388
00:21:17,651 --> 00:21:19,528
I've never told anyone that before.

389
00:21:19,611 --> 00:21:22,281
Tell me the Horde's plans.

390
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:26,618
Oh, is that all?
Why didn't you just say so?

391
00:21:26,702 --> 00:21:28,704
Catra and Hordak are worked up

392
00:21:28,787 --> 00:21:32,207
because Horde Prime is on his way
with his armada.

393
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:35,085
-To conquer all of Etheria.
-[gasps] When?

394
00:21:35,168 --> 00:21:36,503
Any day now, darling.

395
00:21:36,586 --> 00:21:39,673
I'd say it's curtains
for your little rebellion here.

396
00:21:39,756 --> 00:21:42,676
But, hey,
while this truth spell is still working,

397
00:21:42,759 --> 00:21:44,177
here's one more for you.

398
00:21:44,261 --> 00:21:46,430
If you're already losing to Hordak,

399
00:21:46,513 --> 00:21:49,850
you poor lambs don't stand a chance
against Horde Prime.

400
00:21:49,933 --> 00:21:51,101
No.

401
00:21:51,852 --> 00:21:53,603
Adora! Bow!

402
00:21:55,605 --> 00:21:56,606
[gasps]

403
00:22:02,946 --> 00:22:05,032
[Shadow Weaver] You can still stop them.

404
00:22:05,449 --> 00:22:06,325
Let them go.

405
00:22:06,658 --> 00:22:09,453
If they don't trust me,
I don't trust them.

406
00:22:09,995 --> 00:22:13,081
Horde Prime is coming.
We need to be ready for him.

407
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:16,543
I'm gonna figure out how to access
the magic at the Heart of Etheria,

408
00:22:16,626 --> 00:22:17,753
and how to use it.

409
00:22:18,628 --> 00:22:20,630
And I'll do it alone if I have to.

410
00:22:42,694 --> 00:22:44,112
