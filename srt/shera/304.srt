00:00:23,356 --> 00:00:24,941
-[shouts]
-Oh.

2
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:29,571
{\an8}-You're already here. Perfect.
-Yeah. Where have you been?

3
00:00:29,904 --> 00:00:31,740
{\an8}Is this some new She-Ra form?

4
00:00:31,823 --> 00:00:36,077
{\an8}No. This is Huntara. She's the leader
of the Crimson Waste. Or was.

5
00:00:36,161 --> 00:00:40,373
{\an8}Uh, we don't have time to get into it.
We need to get to the Fright Zone.

6
00:00:40,457 --> 00:00:43,043
The world doesn't stop
just because you aren't here.

7
00:00:43,126 --> 00:00:45,587
{\an8}We have been planning our attack
on the Horde.

8
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:48,465
{\an8}That's a relief,
because Catra kidnapped Adora.

9
00:00:48,548 --> 00:00:49,382
[all gasping]

10
00:00:49,466 --> 00:00:51,843
The Horde has Adora?

11
00:00:51,926 --> 00:00:55,930
{\an8}Which also means they can open a portal
because they have her Sword.

12
00:00:56,014 --> 00:00:58,850
-What? I don't understand.
-There's no time.

13
00:00:58,933 --> 00:01:02,103
-Glimmer, slow down.
-We need to go to the Fright Zone now.

14
00:01:02,854 --> 00:01:06,691
We? You are not going anywhere
until you explain.

15
00:01:06,775 --> 00:01:08,902
Glimmer, outside. Now.

27
00:01:45,814 --> 00:01:48,233
This suit may be my best work yet.

28
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:52,904
[shouting]

29
00:01:52,987 --> 00:01:54,989
No reason to get in a tizzy.

30
00:01:55,073 --> 00:01:57,742
I have never been in a tizzy.

31
00:01:57,826 --> 00:02:01,204
You can't expect everything
to work perfectly overnight.

32
00:02:01,663 --> 00:02:02,831
Like our machine.

33
00:02:02,914 --> 00:02:04,999
We still haven't figured out
the missing piece

34
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:07,544
that'll let us cut through
the planetary interference.

35
00:02:07,627 --> 00:02:11,756
If we try now, the portal might not be
stable long enough to get anyone through.

36
00:02:12,215 --> 00:02:13,133
[sighs]

37
00:02:13,591 --> 00:02:17,262
We only need to open a portal
for a short time.

38
00:02:17,345 --> 00:02:20,390
Long enough to send a signal
through to Horde Prime.

39
00:02:20,473 --> 00:02:24,435
Once he receives it, he should have
no trouble opening a portal from his side.

40
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:27,021
And then you'll have to go with them.

41
00:02:29,732 --> 00:02:33,528
But there's still so much data
we could collect. What's the rush?

42
00:02:33,611 --> 00:02:38,199
We'll just keep working on it
until it's perfect.

43
00:02:43,204 --> 00:02:44,497
[grunting]

44
00:02:45,206 --> 00:02:46,457
[gasps]

45
00:02:59,929 --> 00:03:00,763
[Catra] What?

46
00:03:01,306 --> 00:03:03,766
Heh. Didn't expect to see me again?

47
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:06,519
[Entrapta] Oh, you have a whip now?

48
00:03:06,603 --> 00:03:09,105
Focus. I got what you needed.

49
00:03:09,188 --> 00:03:12,734
This sword is the key to the whole planet.

50
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:15,403
I suppose it makes sense.

51
00:03:15,486 --> 00:03:19,866
She-Ra's sword is First Ones tech,
maybe the most powerful I've ever seen.

52
00:03:19,949 --> 00:03:23,369
All this time,
this was the key that we needed.

53
00:03:25,288 --> 00:03:29,417
I guess I should figure out how it works.

54
00:03:30,209 --> 00:03:31,044
[snapping]

55
00:03:31,127 --> 00:03:34,631
I brought you everything you need
to open a portal

56
00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:38,176
and finish the Princesses off for good.
What are we waiting for?

57
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:39,719
Hmm.

58
00:03:40,595 --> 00:03:42,138
[continues grunting]

59
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:48,186
We're wasting too much time.

60
00:03:48,269 --> 00:03:49,437
We need to act.

61
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,773
The Horde has Adora and the Sword.

62
00:03:51,856 --> 00:03:54,067
And then what?
How are you going to get in?

63
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:57,320
You have no plan. We are not rushing in.

64
00:03:57,612 --> 00:03:59,614
I won't lose anyone else.

65
00:03:59,697 --> 00:04:02,158
Before I started "rushing in,"

66
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:05,453
the Rebellion hadn't made a move in years.
You need me.

67
00:04:05,536 --> 00:04:09,958
I need you to be a leader, and that means
not running off whenever you like.

68
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:14,963
What's the point? You'll always be around,
telling me what I can't do.

69
00:04:15,046 --> 00:04:18,967
You never listen.
I try and try to reach you, to trust you.

70
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:20,260
[laughing]

71
00:04:20,385 --> 00:04:22,679
You wanna talk about trust?

72
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:27,058
How come you never told me
that Shadow Weaver was Dad's old teacher?

73
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:28,851
I...

74
00:04:30,353 --> 00:04:32,355
It was a long time ago.

75
00:04:33,398 --> 00:04:36,567
You know what? We should be talking
to her. She knows the Horde.

76
00:04:36,651 --> 00:04:38,236
She can't be trusted.

77
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:40,697
We have to do something.

78
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:45,034
You would see that
if you weren't totally paralyzed by fear.

79
00:04:49,247 --> 00:04:51,332
I am your queen,

80
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:55,295
and I say
we cannot afford to lose anyone else.

81
00:04:55,378 --> 00:04:58,715
Either come up with a reasonable plan,
Commander Glimmer,

82
00:04:58,798 --> 00:05:00,550
or stay out of the way.

83
00:05:01,509 --> 00:05:02,719
[sighs]

84
00:05:03,845 --> 00:05:05,096
[whistling]

85
00:05:05,179 --> 00:05:06,097
Uh...

86
00:05:13,396 --> 00:05:16,107
With the sword connected
to the portal machine,

87
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:19,485
we should finally be able to bypass
the planetary interference.

88
00:05:21,612 --> 00:05:24,073
I just have no idea how it works. Heh.

89
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:25,450
[Adora grunting]

90
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:27,577
Must she be here?

91
00:05:28,619 --> 00:05:29,912
Good question.

92
00:05:30,413 --> 00:05:34,334
I'm not sure if we just need the sword
or if we need She-Ra, too.

93
00:05:35,209 --> 00:05:37,545
You wouldn't happen to know, would you?

94
00:05:37,628 --> 00:05:40,381
No. Even if I did,
I wouldn't tell the Horde.

95
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:43,134
[Entrapta] That's okay.
I like figuring stuff out.

96
00:05:43,217 --> 00:05:45,636
Please, Entrapta, you don't wanna do this.

97
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:49,015
Silence. Entrapta, begin.

98
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:52,060
You...

99
00:05:52,143 --> 00:05:55,313
You took me away from my family
when I was a baby.

100
00:05:55,396 --> 00:05:58,775
You lied to me my whole life,
about the Princesses,

101
00:05:58,858 --> 00:06:01,360
about Etheria, about who I am.

102
00:06:01,861 --> 00:06:04,697
I could not have lied to you
about who you are.

103
00:06:04,781 --> 00:06:09,243
I have never known nor cared
about someone as inconsequential as you.

104
00:06:09,744 --> 00:06:11,079
[Adora shouting]

105
00:06:15,917 --> 00:06:20,630
You should care, because I'm the one
who's gonna make sure you fail.

106
00:06:20,713 --> 00:06:22,423
I will not fail.

107
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:24,634
You have no power to stop me.

108
00:06:25,134 --> 00:06:27,136
I am opening that portal.

109
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:29,388
And I am going to use your own sword

110
00:06:29,472 --> 00:06:33,726
to wipe out the rest of your pathetic
Rebellion once and for-- [grunting]

111
00:06:42,735 --> 00:06:46,489
[growls] Get it to work.

112
00:06:50,451 --> 00:06:51,285
[gasps]

113
00:07:03,422 --> 00:07:04,632
[gasps]

114
00:07:04,882 --> 00:07:06,425
Wow.

115
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:07,677
[grunting]

116
00:07:09,011 --> 00:07:10,680
[Bow] This is a bad idea.

117
00:07:10,763 --> 00:07:12,056
It's a great idea.

118
00:07:13,182 --> 00:07:16,185
Okay, it's terrible.
But what choice do we have?

119
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:19,272
I wanna help as much as you do,
but Shadow Weaver?

120
00:07:19,355 --> 00:07:21,107
Adora needs us now.

121
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:24,569
And Shadow Weaver would know
all about the Fright Zone's weak points.

122
00:07:24,652 --> 00:07:26,279
Let's at least talk to her.

123
00:07:26,737 --> 00:07:27,780
[shouts]

124
00:07:28,656 --> 00:07:29,907
[Shadow Weaver] Princess.

125
00:07:30,658 --> 00:07:31,826
It's about time.

126
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:34,036
You knew we were coming?

127
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:37,457
Him, I had no idea about. But you...

128
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:40,293
You are smart, you want to stop the Horde,

129
00:07:40,376 --> 00:07:43,379
and you know I'm the only one
who can help you.

130
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:47,383
I must admit, I thought it would
take you longer to speak with me.

131
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:50,136
Catra kidnapped Adora
in the Crimson Waste.

132
00:07:50,219 --> 00:07:53,890
We need to get her back, before the Horde
uses her and her sword to open a portal.

133
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:58,478
[Shadow Weaver] His machine is complete?
And they have Adora? We must hurry.

134
00:07:58,561 --> 00:08:01,564
If Hordak has the opportunity
to open a portal,

135
00:08:01,647 --> 00:08:03,232
he will do so immediately.

136
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:05,860
The Alliance will never get there
in time--

137
00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:07,403
But perhaps...

138
00:08:08,654 --> 00:08:10,740
What? What is it?

139
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:14,785
Let me out and I can help you teleport

140
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:17,663
right into the heart of the Fright Zone.

141
00:08:17,747 --> 00:08:19,248
[chuckles] Me?

142
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:23,169
I couldn't even get to the edge of the
Fright Zone without running out of power.

143
00:08:23,461 --> 00:08:27,381
-I'm nowhere near strong enough.
-But I can make you stronger.

144
00:08:27,465 --> 00:08:32,386
I'm still the only sorceress who has ever
been able to tap into a Runestone.

145
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:36,682
If you allow me to access your connection
to the Moonstone,

146
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:39,560
I can enhance your powers.

147
00:08:40,061 --> 00:08:43,564
You could teleport us all the way there.

148
00:08:45,107 --> 00:08:47,151
Uh, us?

149
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:52,031
I suppose you could come.
We'll teleport into Hordak's sanctum,

150
00:08:52,114 --> 00:08:55,326
disable the portal machine,
and find Adora.

151
00:08:57,912 --> 00:09:00,331
You can really make me that powerful?

152
00:09:00,414 --> 00:09:04,168
You think of yourself only as a Princess,

153
00:09:04,877 --> 00:09:08,172
but you're the child of a great sorcerer.

154
00:09:08,256 --> 00:09:14,178
You have a more powerful connection
to magic than you've ever realized.

155
00:09:14,762 --> 00:09:16,347
Let me show you.

156
00:09:17,723 --> 00:09:20,518
You just wanna use Glimmer's power
to escape.

157
00:09:20,601 --> 00:09:23,729
I want to destroy Hordak.

158
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:26,148
We must strike now.

159
00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:29,068
Hordak can't be allowed to open a portal.

160
00:09:29,151 --> 00:09:32,321
We'll never have another opportunity.
You know that.

161
00:09:41,497 --> 00:09:42,498
[gasps]

162
00:09:49,463 --> 00:09:50,756
[Bow groaning]

163
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:56,012
-Hey, would you look at this?
-You can't take that.

164
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:59,348
-[laughs] Let's make this thing official.
-It doesn't even fit.

165
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:06,814
[groaning]

166
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:10,943
Not bad. You look good in a uniform.

167
00:10:13,988 --> 00:10:15,781
Catra. Catra, there you are.

168
00:10:15,865 --> 00:10:20,077
-I have been looking everywhere for you.
-I've had my hands full.

169
00:10:20,161 --> 00:10:22,955
Any minute now,
Hordak's going to open a portal

170
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:27,084
and I'll be the reason
the Horde defeats the Princesses.

171
00:10:27,877 --> 00:10:30,796
But hey, I couldn't have done any of it
without you. Thanks.

172
00:10:31,714 --> 00:10:33,382
[laughing]

173
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:34,675
[shouts]

174
00:10:40,389 --> 00:10:42,725
You're right. Just look away.

175
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:47,730
-I can't. What's taking Hordak so long?
-Entrapta...

176
00:10:48,606 --> 00:10:52,151
we never meant to leave you behind.
We thought you were dead.

177
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:55,488
But Catra said you abandoned me.

178
00:10:55,571 --> 00:10:59,367
Catra would say anything
that helps her get what she wants.

179
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:02,328
Catra is my friend. I think.

180
00:11:03,037 --> 00:11:05,247
Yes, the data says she is.

181
00:11:05,956 --> 00:11:08,042
Look, I understand.

182
00:11:08,417 --> 00:11:09,960
Catra was my friend, too.

183
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:13,506
But she makes bad decisions.
This is one of them.

184
00:11:13,589 --> 00:11:18,010
The Horde's armies will come through,
and then it's all over for Etheria.

185
00:11:18,094 --> 00:11:19,887
You can't open a portal.

186
00:11:31,774 --> 00:11:32,983
Oh, but I can.

187
00:11:33,067 --> 00:11:35,986
Did you miss the whole sword
makes the portal machine work thing?

188
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:38,989
-I really don't have time to explain it.
-It's too dangerous.

189
00:11:39,073 --> 00:11:41,909
All exploration has an element of danger.

190
00:11:42,451 --> 00:11:44,495
But think of what we could find.

191
00:11:44,578 --> 00:11:48,374
Whole worlds, galaxies,
things we can't even imagine.

192
00:11:48,457 --> 00:11:51,961
Entrapta, please listen.
It isn't going to work.

193
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:55,673
The last She-Ra made it
so we could never open another portal.

194
00:11:55,756 --> 00:11:57,883
Trying could destroy everything.

195
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:02,471
I have noticed some anomalies
in my portal trials.

196
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:05,558
They could potentially pose a problem.

197
00:12:06,809 --> 00:12:08,686
Maybe I should run more tests.

198
00:12:10,813 --> 00:12:14,775
You won't try to escape if I just pop out
for a quick sec, will you?

199
00:12:15,192 --> 00:12:16,235
Uh...

200
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:18,237
No?

201
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:23,033
Okay, great, really appreciate it.
Come on, Emily.

202
00:12:24,493 --> 00:12:26,078
[grunting]

203
00:12:34,295 --> 00:12:35,129
[all gasping]

204
00:12:37,548 --> 00:12:39,216
What do you think you're doing?

205
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:42,845
Don't try to stop us.
This is the only way to save Adora.

206
00:12:42,928 --> 00:12:46,223
We're not trying to stop you.
We wanna come with you.

207
00:12:46,307 --> 00:12:50,519
We could do the whole "You can't
come with us, it's too risky" thing.

208
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:53,272
Or you could just accept
that we're coming. Because we are.

209
00:12:53,856 --> 00:12:57,443
A larger group
will be a disadvantage. I won't--

210
00:12:57,526 --> 00:12:59,361
[Mermista] We're calling the shots.

211
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:03,449
You're gonna have to make that thing
bigger, weird scary lady.

212
00:13:06,368 --> 00:13:07,203
Glimmer?

213
00:13:20,257 --> 00:13:21,675
Quickly now.

214
00:13:30,935 --> 00:13:31,894
[gasps]

215
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:00,381
[grunting]

216
00:14:04,385 --> 00:14:05,427
No.

217
00:14:11,308 --> 00:14:12,268
[shouts]

218
00:14:12,893 --> 00:14:13,769
[gasps]

219
00:14:22,069 --> 00:14:25,281
We did it. I did it. Oh, that was amazing.

220
00:14:26,115 --> 00:14:31,287
Hmm. Kind of figured Hordak's sanctum
would be way scarier and not so empty.

221
00:14:31,579 --> 00:14:35,583
Yeah, no,
decorating is not their strongest suit.

222
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:39,545
We aimed for
Hordak's sanctum, but obviously we missed.

223
00:14:39,628 --> 00:14:43,382
We're not far. Stay behind me.
And try to be quiet.

224
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:45,217
[door opens]

225
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:50,973
We have to go.

226
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:52,892
I'll hold her off.

227
00:14:55,436 --> 00:14:56,520
[squealing]

228
00:14:58,063 --> 00:14:59,773
[grunting and shouting]

229
00:15:10,951 --> 00:15:12,328
[alarm blaring]

230
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:15,414
My turn.

231
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:20,252
I didn't almost drown
in these sewers for nothing.

232
00:15:22,296 --> 00:15:23,589
I want in.

233
00:15:25,841 --> 00:15:26,842
[thud]

234
00:15:32,681 --> 00:15:34,558
We'll keep them busy. Go.

235
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:42,691
Lonnie, why did you pull--? Shadow Weaver?

236
00:15:46,028 --> 00:15:47,488
[grunting]

237
00:15:48,489 --> 00:15:53,202
Heh. I heard you were with the enemy,
but are you actually holding hands

238
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:55,120
with a princess right now?

239
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:59,416
There's no sense in trying
to fight us. You don't stand a chance.

240
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:02,461
Join us, or stand aside.

241
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:05,631
[shouts]

242
00:16:07,549 --> 00:16:08,884

[Bow shouting]

244
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:18,394
-Bow.
-Don't lose your focus.

245
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:20,813
Concentrate.

246
00:16:21,188 --> 00:16:22,022

[shouts]

249
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:44,628
Catra, there's no need for us
to be enemies.

250
00:16:44,712 --> 00:16:46,088
I can help you.

251
00:16:46,588 --> 00:16:48,674
I can offer you a way out.

252
00:16:49,216 --> 00:16:52,428
So, what? You're on the side of good now?

253
00:16:52,886 --> 00:16:57,307
You made me this way,
and you get to be the good guy?

254
00:16:57,433 --> 00:16:59,018
[shouting]

255
00:17:02,896 --> 00:17:06,150
Do you know what happened to me
after you escaped?

256
00:17:06,233 --> 00:17:07,359
Do you even care?

257
00:17:07,735 --> 00:17:10,571
You couldn't wait to get away from here,
from me.

258
00:17:12,823 --> 00:17:14,992
But you came back for Adora.

259
00:17:15,826 --> 00:17:18,579
I came back to stop Hordak.

260
00:17:18,662 --> 00:17:20,664
I will make sure he's destroyed.

261
00:17:21,165 --> 00:17:23,625
Don't make me destroy you, too.

262
00:17:24,001 --> 00:17:26,670
Oh, I'm going to make sure we win.

263
00:17:27,171 --> 00:17:29,506
We're going to open that portal,

264
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:33,260
and then there will be nothing left of you
or the Princesses.

265
00:17:34,636 --> 00:17:36,013
[groaning]

266
00:17:37,639 --> 00:17:38,807
[grunting]

267
00:17:45,481 --> 00:17:47,775
Stop it. You're taking too much.

268
00:17:59,661 --> 00:18:02,289
No. You can't fight them,
they're too strong.

269
00:18:09,171 --> 00:18:13,967
Ah, boy, I really appreciate you
letting me assist you. I miss hanging out.

270
00:18:14,384 --> 00:18:16,929
Yeah, you've been so busy
with Hordak lately and Catra--

271
00:18:17,387 --> 00:18:19,389
I mean, she's got her new friends.

272
00:18:32,152 --> 00:18:34,446
Oh, this is not good.

273
00:18:35,656 --> 00:18:37,741
Oh, you want me to go, too?

274
00:18:37,825 --> 00:18:40,786
I understand. I'm probably in your way.
I'll just--

275
00:18:40,869 --> 00:18:41,912
No, not that.

276
00:18:41,995 --> 00:18:45,374
I've been running diagnostics
on the portal. Watch.

277
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:49,419
[explosions playing on screen]

278
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:55,134
You are right. That is not good.

279
00:18:55,926 --> 00:18:59,012
Is that gonna happen?
I mean, to the actual planet?

280
00:18:59,096 --> 00:19:00,973
This is just an illustration.

281
00:19:01,056 --> 00:19:03,851
What will actually happen
will be much worse.

282
00:19:04,351 --> 00:19:06,770
If my numbers are right, and they are,

283
00:19:06,854 --> 00:19:10,399
if we open a portal,
the anomalies will be catastrophic.

284
00:19:10,732 --> 00:19:12,693
It'll unhinge time and space,

285
00:19:12,776 --> 00:19:16,488
creating a warped reality
that will collapse in on itself,

286
00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:18,532
erasing us from existence.

287
00:19:19,032 --> 00:19:21,827
I never thought I'd say this,
but we can't go through with it.

288
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:22,911
[door opens]

289
00:19:23,871 --> 00:19:25,038
[Scorpia] Catra.

[grunts]

291
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:29,835
Why aren't you in Hordak's lab?

292
00:19:29,918 --> 00:19:31,295
Uh, mm...

293
00:19:31,378 --> 00:19:32,337
There's no time.

294
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:35,382
-We need to fire up the portal machine.
-[Entrapta] We can't.

295
00:19:35,465 --> 00:19:38,051
Opening a portal right now
will be disastrous.

296
00:19:38,135 --> 00:19:41,471
It's going to collapse
and take us all with it. Adora was right.

297
00:19:41,555 --> 00:19:43,599
[Catra] Adora is right.

298
00:19:43,974 --> 00:19:45,142
[chuckling]

299
00:19:47,811 --> 00:19:50,939
Adora gets everything she wants.

[sighs]

301
00:19:54,776 --> 00:19:58,447
But not this time.
This time, I am going to win.

302
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:02,618
I don't care what it takes.
We are opening that portal now.

303
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:06,538
No. I won't. I need to tell Hordak.
He'll understand--

00:20:06,955 --> 00:20:08,290
[shouting]

305
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:12,961
[panting]

306
00:20:14,421 --> 00:20:17,883
-Get her out of here.
-What do you want me to do with her?

307
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:20,344
I don't care. Just get rid of her.

308
00:20:21,345 --> 00:20:25,390
-Put her on the transport to Beast Island.
-Beast Island? You can't.

309
00:20:27,267 --> 00:20:28,477
You wanna be next?

310

00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:57,923
-Glimmer, no.
-There's no choice. Do it.

312
00:21:01,843 --> 00:21:02,886
[Hordak] Oh...

313
00:21:03,011 --> 00:21:04,638
She did it.

314
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:06,515
The Princesses are here.

315
00:21:06,598 --> 00:21:09,601
There's no time,
we need to open the portal.

316
00:21:09,685 --> 00:21:11,853
Where's Entrapta? I need her.

317
00:21:13,647 --> 00:21:15,816
Who do you think let the Princesses in?

But she--

322
00:21:24,324 --> 00:21:25,158
She wouldn't.

323
00:21:25,242 --> 00:21:26,285
[laughing]

324
00:21:26,576 --> 00:21:29,621
-Did you really think she was on our side?
-[shouts]

325
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:32,165
Oh, you can't trust anyone,

326
00:21:32,249 --> 00:21:34,793
especially a Princess.

327
00:21:35,335 --> 00:21:37,838
They'll just use you
to get what they want.

328
00:21:39,006 --> 00:21:42,634
Open the portal and let's end this.

Bow.

No!
