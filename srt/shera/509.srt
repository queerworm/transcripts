[Glimmer cheers]

00:00:20,395 --> 00:00:23,648
{\an8}Oh! I missed this.

3
00:00:23,732 --> 00:00:26,192
{\an8}Really? 'Cause I could stand
to never do it again.

4
00:00:28,236 --> 00:00:32,741
{\an8}[gasps] This place is a true blessing.

5
00:00:33,283 --> 00:00:35,201
{\an8}What is this tingling sensation?

6
00:00:35,702 --> 00:00:36,953
{\an8}That's warmth, buddy.

7
00:00:37,078 --> 00:00:39,122
{\an8}Welcome to a living planet.

8
00:00:39,205 --> 00:00:42,042
{\an8}Hey, I think you guys
should take a look at this.

00:00:46,504 --> 00:00:47,505
{\an8}[gasps]

10
00:00:49,632 --> 00:00:50,467
[Glimmer] No.

11
00:00:51,301 --> 00:00:52,552
Where is everyone?

12
00:00:53,428 --> 00:00:55,180
-There was a fight.
-Makes sense.

13
00:00:55,263 --> 00:00:57,182
Perfuma said
the Rebellion was compromised.

14
00:00:57,265 --> 00:00:59,726
If someone in camp got chipped
and went after the rest,

15
00:00:59,809 --> 00:01:01,186
it would've been chaos.

16
00:01:07,817 --> 00:01:11,154
Adora, what if--?
What if there's no one left?

17
00:01:11,279 --> 00:01:14,282
We don't know that.
They might have just moved camp.

18
00:01:14,449 --> 00:01:16,826
Wherever they are, we need to find them.

19
00:01:17,327 --> 00:01:19,454
Maybe they went back to Bright Moon?

20
00:01:19,829 --> 00:01:22,791
Or maybe my dad took them to hide out
in Mystacor?

21
00:01:22,874 --> 00:01:25,251
We can't just traipse
into your old hangouts

22
00:01:25,335 --> 00:01:28,088
and play nice with your pals.
We don't know who's chipped.

23
00:01:28,171 --> 00:01:30,840
Wow, you don't trust the Princesses?

24
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:32,258
I am shocked.

25
00:01:32,342 --> 00:01:35,345
Really?
Huh, it seems very in character for her.

26
00:01:35,637 --> 00:01:36,721
Catra's right.

27
00:01:36,805 --> 00:01:39,682
We should gather intel first
so we don't fall into a trap.

28
00:01:40,016 --> 00:01:44,646
Erelandia is the closest village to camp.
Maybe someone there knows what happened.

29
00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:46,606
-I'm on it.
-[Bow &amp; Adora yelp]

30
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:51,194
How about a warning next time?

31
00:01:51,277 --> 00:01:53,071
[chuckles] Sorry.

How many now?

43
00:02:44,539 --> 00:02:46,583
At least a dozen occupied planets.

44
00:02:46,916 --> 00:02:50,003
We are stamping out the dissidents,
but their message is spreading.

45
00:02:50,295 --> 00:02:53,172
They say they are revolting
against the Horde in the name of...

46
00:02:53,798 --> 00:02:55,508
the Rebellion... and...

47
00:02:56,426 --> 00:02:57,260
of She-Ra.

48
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:02,640
My heart aches
for these misguided children.

49
00:03:03,057 --> 00:03:04,309
Now more than ever,

50
00:03:04,392 --> 00:03:08,438
I am assured of my plan
to use the Heart of Etheria

51
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:11,149
to bring peace to all the universe.

52
00:03:11,774 --> 00:03:18,781
But without She-Ra,
we must find another way to activate it.

53
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:22,660
Find the dissenters
and make an example of them.

54
00:03:22,744 --> 00:03:26,205
It is time to crush
this spark of rebellion for good.

55
00:03:26,915 --> 00:03:30,877
Send word to our dear sister on Etheria.

56
00:03:34,672 --> 00:03:37,467
The townspeople might be able to tell us
what happened,

57
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:39,677
but we need to keep a low profile.

58
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:43,598
We should be able to avoid detection
as long as we stick with Wrong Hordak.

59
00:03:43,973 --> 00:03:45,058
Let's go.

60
00:03:57,612 --> 00:04:01,658
Brother, uh, I hope you, too,
are full only of love for Horde Prime

61
00:04:01,991 --> 00:04:04,160
and have no crippling doubt
eating at your soul.

62
00:04:08,414 --> 00:04:09,916
Glory be to Horde Prime.

63
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:11,876
Ah...

64
00:04:13,795 --> 00:04:15,838
Nice job, Wrong Hordak.

65
00:04:16,214 --> 00:04:17,674
You blend right in.

66
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:20,218
You appear to have a facial tic.

67
00:04:20,468 --> 00:04:21,761
Is it cause for concern?

68
00:04:21,844 --> 00:04:24,138
Huh? Oh, I'm winking.

69
00:04:24,305 --> 00:04:26,266
It signals unspoken intent
behind my words.

70
00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:28,601
In this case,
our mutual deception of the Horde.

71
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:30,144
Now you try.

72
00:04:30,728 --> 00:04:35,900
Oh, expressing facial emotion
is a privilege reserved only for Prime.

73
00:04:35,984 --> 00:04:38,653
Which is exactly why you should do it.

74
00:04:40,196 --> 00:04:42,198
[grunting]

75
00:04:43,908 --> 00:04:46,077
Oh. [giggles]

76
00:04:46,452 --> 00:04:47,662
Now you've got it.

[yelps]

78
00:04:54,877 --> 00:04:57,630
Oh, there's a local.
I'm gonna go talk to him.

79
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:00,091
Um, hi there. I was just wondering if--

80
00:05:00,174 --> 00:05:01,759
I don't know anything.

81
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:03,511
Please, just let me go.

82
00:05:03,678 --> 00:05:05,555
I was just trying to get home.

83
00:05:05,638 --> 00:05:07,390
We're not going to hurt you. We just--

00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:11,144

Glory be to Horde Prime.

87
00:05:16,774 --> 00:05:17,942
Hmm. No chip.

88
00:05:18,234 --> 00:05:20,528
But something is making the locals
real skittish.

89
00:05:20,611 --> 00:05:21,446
You think?

90
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:24,282
[Catra] If these people are scared,
they're more likely

91
00:05:24,365 --> 00:05:26,951
to sell us out to Prime
than tell us anything useful.

92
00:05:27,035 --> 00:05:28,036
[locals whispering]

93
00:05:28,119 --> 00:05:29,412
We should just go.

94
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:32,415
Not until we find out if there's any sign
of the Princesses here.

95
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:33,666
Leave this to me.

96
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:37,920
You may all have magical powers
and alien pets,

97
00:05:38,129 --> 00:05:42,175
but what we need now
is the team's resident regular guy.

98
00:05:42,467 --> 00:05:43,509
They'll talk to me.

99
00:05:46,721 --> 00:05:47,638
Hey there.

100
00:05:47,722 --> 00:05:50,475
I'm just your average traveler
passing through.

101
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:53,853
Would you mind if I asked you
a few questions about your lovely town?

102
00:05:56,397 --> 00:05:59,150
Uh... what is it you want to know?

103
00:05:59,233 --> 00:06:02,028
Have you seen any Princesses
around these parts?

104
00:06:02,111 --> 00:06:03,446
Princesses? Where?!

105
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:04,822
[yelps, then grunts]

106
00:06:07,075 --> 00:06:10,203
So, obviously, at least some
of our friends were here recently

107
00:06:10,286 --> 00:06:13,206
and made an... impression.

108
00:06:13,289 --> 00:06:16,000
A town that hates Princesses?

109
00:06:16,084 --> 00:06:17,752
Should I buy property here?

110
00:06:19,754 --> 00:06:22,465
Is what I would have said,
before I joined you.

111
00:06:22,673 --> 00:06:23,508
Go, team.

112
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:25,593
We should split up and look around.

113
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:27,470
Whoever it was could still be close.

114
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:29,889
Catra, you take Entrapta and Melog.

115
00:06:30,515 --> 00:06:31,933
Keep them safe, okay?

116
00:06:32,016 --> 00:06:33,184
[purrs]

117
00:06:33,601 --> 00:06:34,560
Let's move out.

118
00:06:38,731 --> 00:06:41,734
[Bow] After everything
the Rebellion's done for Etheria,

119
00:06:41,943 --> 00:06:44,445
how can people
be afraid of the Princesses?

120
00:06:44,529 --> 00:06:47,949
We've been gone a while, Bow.
Things are worse here than when we left.

121
00:06:48,032 --> 00:06:50,118
You can't blame people
for being scared of...

122
00:06:50,201 --> 00:06:52,870
[whispers] ...suspicious dissenters.
They're over there.

123
00:06:55,623 --> 00:06:56,457
...them.

124
00:06:57,041 --> 00:06:58,167
Cover for us, okay?

125
00:06:58,793 --> 00:06:59,794
Yes, brother.

126
00:07:01,337 --> 00:07:03,714
Did you just--? Did you just wink at me?

127
00:07:05,508 --> 00:07:06,551
Brothers!

128
00:07:06,884 --> 00:07:09,262
There is nothing to see here.

129
00:07:09,595 --> 00:07:10,888
Please move along.

130
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:13,933
[clones] Glory be to Horde Prime.

131
00:07:15,726 --> 00:07:17,687
Oh, no. I don't want any part of this.

132
00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:20,481
You're wearing hooded cloaks.
It's highly suspicious.

133
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:23,276
Are you hiding from the Horde?
I'll call for help.

134
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:29,365
No need for that.
We're just, uh... browsing.

135
00:07:36,497 --> 00:07:42,545
So... it's seems like things have been
pretty bad around here lately.

136
00:07:42,628 --> 00:07:44,964
Things are bad everywhere.
We're all just trying

137
00:07:45,047 --> 00:07:46,966
to get through the day
without any trouble.

138
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:51,137
So, what, you're all just giving up
and letting Prime take over?

139
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:53,723
-Well, what else are we supposed to do?
-Bow, be cool.

140
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:55,057
Undercover, remember?

141
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:59,562
Well, I'm just a completely objective
third-party observer.

142
00:07:59,645 --> 00:08:02,899
But Erelandia should join the Rebellion
and fight back.

143
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:03,983
Oh, yeah. That's nice.

144
00:08:04,066 --> 00:08:05,693
[scoffs] The Rebellion?

145
00:08:05,776 --> 00:08:07,737
The Rebellion is on the Horde's side now.

146
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:10,656
If it's not clones attacking us,
it's Princesses.

147
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:13,242
No. No, it's not their fault.

148
00:08:13,618 --> 00:08:17,246
-It's Prime's chips controlling them--
-Do you think it makes a difference to us?

149
00:08:18,206 --> 00:08:22,168
Well, there are still some Princesses
fighting for Etheria.

150
00:08:22,251 --> 00:08:23,419
Okay, well, there she is.

151
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:26,506
[gasps] Queen Glimmer, I-- I-- I'm sorry.

152
00:08:26,714 --> 00:08:29,592
-Please, I don't want any trouble.
-We're not with the Horde.

153
00:08:29,675 --> 00:08:31,469
Someone is coming, brothers.

154
00:08:31,844 --> 00:08:32,678
Ah?

155
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:35,765
That's not how winking works.
Is someone coming or not?

156
00:08:36,307 --> 00:08:37,350
[Adora screams]

157
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:50,279
Once I get these samples analyzed,
we'll know if Princesses were here

158
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:52,406
in approximately four to six weeks.

159
00:08:53,241 --> 00:08:54,575
-[Spinnerella grunts]
-[gasps]

160
00:08:56,452 --> 00:08:57,537
Found them.

[Bow, Glimmer &amp; Adora yelling]

162
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:10,466
That's the windy one, right?

163
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,385
Isn't she with us?

164
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:13,928
Not anymore.

165
00:09:14,303 --> 00:09:16,681
Spinnerella, this isn't you.

166
00:09:17,098 --> 00:09:18,766
You have to fight the chip.

167
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:20,810
My fight is over.

168
00:09:21,102 --> 00:09:23,604
Lord Prime has given me peace.

169
00:09:24,021 --> 00:09:26,107
It's time for you to join us.

170
00:09:28,609 --> 00:09:30,903
Not... today.

171
00:09:35,157 --> 00:09:35,992
[grunts]

172
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:37,785
[all scream]

173
00:09:39,954 --> 00:09:41,205
Prime really did it.

174
00:09:41,747 --> 00:09:44,750
How--? How are we supposed to fight
our own friends?

175
00:09:45,126 --> 00:09:46,794
It never stopped you before.

176
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:57,346
Hey, guys, welcome back.

177
00:10:02,643 --> 00:10:04,020
Hello, beloved.

178
00:10:04,562 --> 00:10:05,813
[growls]

179
00:10:15,239 --> 00:10:16,490
[screams]

180
00:10:18,701 --> 00:10:19,869
[yelps]

181
00:10:31,797 --> 00:10:33,174
Spinny, don't.

182
00:10:33,257 --> 00:10:34,800
-We've gotta go.
-No. Wait.

183
00:10:52,443 --> 00:10:53,277
Brother?

184
00:10:54,362 --> 00:10:55,488
Yes, Lord Prime?

185
00:10:56,113 --> 00:10:57,448
Come with me.

186
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:00,576
[Horde Prime sighs]

187
00:11:01,118 --> 00:11:03,454
There is something I am forgetting.

188
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,248
It plays at the edges of my mind.

189
00:11:07,124 --> 00:11:08,459
Etheria.

190
00:11:09,126 --> 00:11:13,964
Long ago, I heard that name before,
though it fell on different ears.

191
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:15,633
Prepare the vessel.

192
00:11:15,841 --> 00:11:18,969
I must access the memories
stored in this version.

193
00:11:33,275 --> 00:11:36,904
The First Ones sought
a new source of power on ancient worlds.

194
00:11:37,488 --> 00:11:38,322
Why?

195
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:42,284
Why bend themselves
to the whims of magic and myth?

196
00:11:58,467 --> 00:12:00,970
The fools took their secrets
with them when they died.

197
00:12:01,303 --> 00:12:04,140
But I will find another way.

198
00:12:05,724 --> 00:12:08,310
Is there something wrong, little brother?

199
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:13,524
It is an honor to bask in the glory
of your former selves, Lord Prime.

200
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,619
What were you thinking?

201
00:12:25,744 --> 00:12:28,164
Netossa, I'm so glad you're okay.

202
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:29,457
Why'd you do that?

203
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:31,625
I've been tracking Spinny for days.

204
00:12:31,792 --> 00:12:33,169
I almost had her.

205
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:35,045
Looked more like she almost had you.

206
00:12:35,337 --> 00:12:37,715
Catra? Stand back. I'll handle this one.

207
00:12:37,798 --> 00:12:39,216
What one? [yelps]

208
00:12:41,135 --> 00:12:42,344
[roars]

209
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:45,431
Netossa, it's a long story,
but she's with us now.

210
00:12:46,307 --> 00:12:47,183
Really?

211
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:48,100
[Catra hisses]

212
00:12:48,642 --> 00:12:49,477
Yeah.

213
00:12:54,315 --> 00:12:55,149
[grunts]

214
00:12:57,026 --> 00:12:59,153
-Watch out, a clone.
-Uh...

215
00:12:59,862 --> 00:13:02,656
He's, uh-- He's actually on our side, too.

216
00:13:02,948 --> 00:13:07,786
So, the only person
I'm fighting here is... my own wife?

217
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:11,832
Netossa, what happened to everyone else?

218
00:13:14,335 --> 00:13:15,711
They got Spinny first.

219
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,171
And she got to the others.

220
00:13:17,546 --> 00:13:19,423
She chipped them.

221
00:13:19,882 --> 00:13:24,094
Mermista, Scorpia... King Micah.

222
00:13:26,138 --> 00:13:30,518
Prime is forcing them to attack
the people of Etheria, to attack us.

223
00:13:30,809 --> 00:13:34,271
The other Princesses are in hiding,
trying to figure out what to do next,

224
00:13:34,939 --> 00:13:37,066
but I can't wait for them.

225
00:13:37,441 --> 00:13:40,236
All I know is,
I have to get Spinnerella back.

226
00:13:40,444 --> 00:13:41,987
Whatever it takes.

227
00:13:43,906 --> 00:13:44,990
We were gone.

228
00:13:45,241 --> 00:13:47,368
We weren't here to help our friends.

229
00:13:47,451 --> 00:13:49,870
And the people
we were supposed to be fighting for

230
00:13:49,954 --> 00:13:51,830
have lost all hope in us.

231
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:56,460
Horde Prime tore our home apart.

232
00:13:56,544 --> 00:13:57,878
He took our friends.

233
00:13:57,962 --> 00:14:01,215
He's not gonna stop
until he's taken everything from us.

234
00:14:15,771 --> 00:14:18,607
Netossa... I'm sorry.

235
00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:20,359
We should've been there.

236
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:24,238
But we're here now
and we're not giving up.

237
00:14:25,573 --> 00:14:27,700
We've never faced greater odds than this.

238
00:14:28,075 --> 00:14:30,160
But for everything Prime has thrown at us,

239
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:33,080
he still hasn't managed to stop us.

240
00:14:37,835 --> 00:14:41,672
We're going back for Spinnerella
and for the people of Erelandia

241
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:45,092
and to show Prime
that Etheria's not done fighting yet.

242
00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:47,553
We'll need everyone's help
to pull this off.

243
00:14:47,636 --> 00:14:50,639
-So?
-We won't let Prime win this one.

244
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:51,640
I'm in.

245
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:53,809
I am honored to fight beside you,
brothers.

246
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:55,060
Sure. Why not?

247
00:14:55,144 --> 00:14:57,771
I have some experience
taking out Princesses.

248
00:15:03,485 --> 00:15:04,403
Thank you.

249
00:15:10,659 --> 00:15:14,038
I swear I wasn't helping She-Ra.
I didn't even know it was her.

250
00:15:14,455 --> 00:15:16,916
Prime rewards honesty from his children.

251
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:20,085
Tell us where she is
and you will be absolved.

252
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:23,923
[Wrong Hordak] The rebels have been
sighted in the outskirts of the woods.

253
00:15:24,006 --> 00:15:24,840
Come at once.

254
00:15:32,264 --> 00:15:33,515
Where are the rebels?

255
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:37,353
Right beside you. Ah?

256
00:15:38,145 --> 00:15:38,979
[both gasp]

257
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:40,940
[yells]

258
00:15:51,033 --> 00:15:51,867
Gotcha.

259
00:15:53,035 --> 00:15:53,869
You're clear.

260
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:05,005
You go deal with Spinnerella.
We'll take care of the bots.

261
00:16:05,589 --> 00:16:06,423
Be careful.

262
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:08,425
Always am.

263
00:16:09,927 --> 00:16:13,597
Please, I have nothing to do with her.
You have to believe me.

264
00:16:14,264 --> 00:16:15,432
The shopkeeper.

265
00:16:15,516 --> 00:16:17,309
No wonder she didn't trust us.

266
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:26,026
Adora, what if...
she can't come back from this?

267
00:16:26,527 --> 00:16:27,861
She's still in there.

268
00:16:28,112 --> 00:16:30,447
She needs you to remind her who she is.

269
00:16:30,948 --> 00:16:33,325
And we need to remind Prime who we are.

270
00:16:34,243 --> 00:16:36,996
For the honor of Grayskull!

271
00:16:59,476 --> 00:17:00,561
[whistles]

272
00:17:00,644 --> 00:17:01,729
New look?

273
00:17:06,108 --> 00:17:06,984
Spinnerella!

274
00:17:09,111 --> 00:17:10,821
Welcome back, beloved.

Queen Glimmer?

278
00:17:17,411 --> 00:17:19,663
We won't abandon Erelandia.

279
00:17:21,957 --> 00:17:23,167

[gasps]

281
00:17:46,523 --> 00:17:47,983
What are you doing?

282
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:50,319
I'm trying not to hurt her.

283
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:52,571
Stop holding back. She won't.

284
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:14,134
[yells]

285
00:18:22,184 --> 00:18:23,393
That's more like it.

286
00:18:32,069 --> 00:18:33,237
Spinny, stop.

287
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:35,155
It's me, Netossa.

288
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:39,660
Please. I love you.

289
00:18:40,035 --> 00:18:41,495
Come back to me.

290
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:48,085
Netossa?

291
00:18:49,211 --> 00:18:50,129
Spinny?

292
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:51,505
Is that you?

293
00:18:53,173 --> 00:18:54,091
Darling.

294
00:18:56,426 --> 00:18:57,511
No.

00:19:14,903 --> 00:19:17,239
She's still in there. I saw her.

298
00:19:17,489 --> 00:19:19,408
We can get her back, I know it.

299
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,869
[screams] Huh?

00:19:26,415 --> 00:19:28,041

301
00:19:29,459 --> 00:19:31,503
It's good to have you guys back.

302
00:19:32,212 --> 00:19:35,424
She'll, um... She'll be okay.

303
00:19:35,507 --> 00:19:37,676
Spinnerella. After the chip, I mean.

304
00:19:38,051 --> 00:19:39,720
I, uh, have some experience.

305
00:19:41,221 --> 00:19:42,514
[shopkeeper] Princesses.

306
00:19:43,265 --> 00:19:47,644
-Well, technically, I'm not actually--
-I still think you sort are trouble,

307
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:50,314
but thank you for freeing our town.

308
00:19:50,814 --> 00:19:54,568
I don't know what we can do,
but if the Rebellion ever needs it,

309
00:19:54,651 --> 00:19:57,905
you can always find a friendly face
in Erelandia.

310
00:19:59,072 --> 00:20:01,200
Oh! Ah.

311
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:12,586
I think Horde Prime is going to know
She-Ra's back.

312
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:14,213
Good.

313
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:17,674
[growls]

314
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:22,930
Set coordinates for Etheria.

315
00:20:23,597 --> 00:20:27,851
Clearly, I am going to have to
handle this embarrassment myself.

[gasps]

317
00:20:45,869 --> 00:20:48,372
This is where the Rebellion is hiding out?

318
00:20:48,872 --> 00:20:50,791
Yep. Why? Have you been here?

319
00:20:52,292 --> 00:20:53,252
[Bow laughs]

00:21:01,426 --> 00:21:02,636
Show us your necks!

323
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:04,596
Perfuma, they're good.

324
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,014
Your necks!

-Ah, Glimmer!
-Frosta!

329
00:21:21,655 --> 00:21:23,156
It's so nice to see you guys.

330
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,866
And we're so sorry we took so long.

331
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:26,994
But we're back
and we're gonna help you fight.

00:21:27,077 --> 00:21:28,036

-[sobbing]
-All right, let-- Let it out.

340
00:21:48,473 --> 00:21:51,393
I don't wanna be in charge anymore!

341
00:21:51,476 --> 00:21:53,353
I think he'll never let me go back there.

342
00:21:57,607 --> 00:21:58,859
Hey, come here.

343
00:21:58,942 --> 00:22:00,986
It's time for you
to officially meet everyone.

344
00:22:01,862 --> 00:22:02,738
You sure?

345
00:22:07,534 --> 00:22:08,660
Are you serious?

346
00:22:09,077 --> 00:22:11,246
Deadly serious, Horde scum.

347
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:15,083
Frosta! It's-- It's a long story,
but Catra's with us now.

348
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:16,001
Okay?

349
00:22:16,251 --> 00:22:19,504
[grunts] Fine.
But I still don't like her face.

350
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:21,631
She can live with that.

351
00:22:22,924 --> 00:22:24,801
Did you find her?

352
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:27,220
I did, but...

353
00:22:27,304 --> 00:22:30,098
Spinnerella got away,
but we'll get her back.

354
00:22:30,724 --> 00:22:32,768
