1
00:00:18,268 --> 00:00:19,686
[Bow] So, wait, hold on.

2
00:00:19,769 --> 00:00:22,439
Where have you two been
this whole time again?

3
00:00:22,522 --> 00:00:25,275
{\an8}[Shadow Weaver] While you were traipsing
around in space,

4
00:00:25,358 --> 00:00:28,361
{\an8}some of us have been working to stop
the Heart of Etheria

5
00:00:28,445 --> 00:00:30,697
{\an8}from falling into Prime's hands.

6
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:34,659
{\an8}We discovered the same thing you did.
Rumors of a Failsafe

7
00:00:34,743 --> 00:00:37,829
that will break the restraints
the First Ones built

8
00:00:37,912 --> 00:00:40,206
{\an8}and set the stolen magic free.

9
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:42,417
{\an8}Are you kidding?

10
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:44,711
After everything that happened last time,

11
00:00:44,794 --> 00:00:47,213
{\an8}you're still going after
the Heart of Etheria?

12
00:00:47,297 --> 00:00:49,048
{\an8}And you're helping her?

13
00:00:49,132 --> 00:00:52,051
{\an8}We're trying to free the magic
for all of Etheria

14
00:00:52,135 --> 00:00:54,471
{\an8}so we can be strong enough to fight Prime.

15
00:00:54,554 --> 00:00:57,348
I'm doing this for your father
and for you.

16
00:00:57,766 --> 00:01:00,393
Shadow Weaver is the lesser of two evils.

17
00:01:00,477 --> 00:01:03,104
-At least you admit she's evil.
-[growls]

18
00:01:03,188 --> 00:01:05,690
[Shadow Weaver] You're one to talk,
aren't you?

19
00:01:06,149 --> 00:01:07,525
[both growl]

20
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:12,614
Tell us what you know about the Failsafe.
What makes you think it's in Mystacor?

21
00:01:12,697 --> 00:01:14,324
As any good sorcerer knows,

22
00:01:14,407 --> 00:01:18,411
Mystacor was built on the ruins
of an ancient First Ones citadel.

23
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:20,163
And beneath Mystacor--

24
00:01:20,246 --> 00:01:22,082
Ooh, ooh. Can I tell this part?

25
00:01:22,624 --> 00:01:23,875
Go ahead.

26
00:01:24,542 --> 00:01:27,962
Beneath Mystacor,
there are many secret tunnels and rooms,

27
00:01:28,046 --> 00:01:30,048
forgotten and sealed off.

28
00:01:30,131 --> 00:01:32,967
No one has been able
to access them in centuries,

29
00:01:33,051 --> 00:01:35,678
but there are whispers
of what they contain.

30
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:37,806
An artifact known as the Crystal of Arxia,

31
00:01:37,889 --> 00:01:40,767
hidden there by a group
of traitorous First Ones.

32
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:42,227
You said I could do it!

33
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:43,812
You were taking too long.

34
00:01:44,145 --> 00:01:48,817
Arxia. That must be the outpost
that Mara's rebels were talking about!

35
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:50,902
The Failsafe might be underneath Mystacor!

36
00:01:50,985 --> 00:01:52,946
[Shadow Weaver] Reaching it won't be easy.

37
00:01:53,029 --> 00:01:56,741
But I have spent my whole life
studying the secrets of Mystacor.

38
00:01:56,825 --> 00:01:57,784
I can get us in.

39
00:01:57,867 --> 00:02:00,370
If you figured it out on your own,
why come back here?

40
00:02:00,453 --> 00:02:01,704
Why do you need us at all?

41
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:04,624
[Shadow Weaver] Because Mystacor
is controlled by Micah,

42
00:02:04,707 --> 00:02:09,212
who, you may recall,
is controlled by Horde Prime.

43
00:02:09,671 --> 00:02:12,423
You have allowed Prime
to take too much ground.

44
00:02:12,507 --> 00:02:15,343
If he seizes the Heart,
it will all be over.

45
00:02:15,426 --> 00:02:18,138
There is no more time
for half measures, Adora.

46
00:02:18,221 --> 00:02:20,056
You must act now.

47
00:02:23,434 --> 00:02:26,187
It's the only lead we have.
We have to try.

48
00:02:26,271 --> 00:02:29,774
It'll have to be a stealth mission.
Catra, do you think you and Melog can--?

49
00:02:30,859 --> 00:02:34,445
Oh, leave her to sulk.
We can't let her slow us down.

50
00:02:34,529 --> 00:02:36,573
You guys get ready. I'll find her.

Catra. Are you coming with us to Mystacor?

62
00:03:12,734 --> 00:03:13,735
Why would I do that?

63
00:03:13,818 --> 00:03:16,154
Seems like you and Shadow Weaver
have it handled.

64
00:03:17,655 --> 00:03:22,619
[sighs] After everything she's done to us,
you're really going to follow her?

65
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:26,122
I don't like it either,
but this is the only plan we have.

66
00:03:26,205 --> 00:03:28,875
The Failsafe could finally save Etheria.

67
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:33,755
Shadow Weaver hurt us.
I haven't forgotten that.

68
00:03:34,756 --> 00:03:37,383
But Prime is hurting so many more people.

69
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:39,260
I need to stop him, Catra.

70
00:03:39,844 --> 00:03:41,179
I know, I know.

71
00:03:41,262 --> 00:03:43,723
You have to go save the world.
Spare me the speech.

72
00:03:44,641 --> 00:03:47,185
Hey, she can't do anything to us anymore.

73
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:49,520
Please, come. We--

74
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,190
I could really use your help.

75
00:03:54,984 --> 00:03:58,863
Fine. But I'm only doing this to make sure
Shadow Weaver doesn't try anything.

76
00:03:58,947 --> 00:04:00,323
Not because I like you.

77
00:04:00,406 --> 00:04:01,449
[Melog purrs]

78
00:04:01,532 --> 00:04:02,408
[Adora yelps]

79
00:04:09,624 --> 00:04:11,793
-Bow! I need to talk to you!
-[yelps]

80
00:04:11,876 --> 00:04:15,046
I was finally able to remove
Spinnerella's chip,

81
00:04:15,129 --> 00:04:18,383
but it was a lot more difficult
than removing Catra's.

82
00:04:18,466 --> 00:04:22,095
The chip had almost entirely fused
to her nervous system.

83
00:04:22,178 --> 00:04:23,972
If we'd waited any longer,

84
00:04:24,055 --> 00:04:26,557
I'm not sure we would've been able
to get it off at all.

85
00:04:26,641 --> 00:04:29,602
The chip would've become a part of her.

86
00:04:29,686 --> 00:04:32,480
That means we're running out of time
to save everyone else.

87
00:04:32,563 --> 00:04:35,316
Yes. Luckily, I've got an idea.

88
00:04:35,817 --> 00:04:40,238
This is the network that connects
all the chips to Prime's hivemind.

89
00:04:40,321 --> 00:04:42,949
If I can just figure out how to crack
his signal pattern,

90
00:04:43,032 --> 00:04:46,035
I could disrupt it,
severing his connection to the chips

91
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:47,829
and taking them all off-line at once!

92
00:04:47,912 --> 00:04:50,915
That's amazing!
We could free everyone on Etheria!

93
00:04:50,999 --> 00:04:54,377
You're a genius, Entrapta.
Just keep working on it until you get it.

94
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:55,878
We'll be back later tonight.

95
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:56,921
You got it!

96
00:05:14,063 --> 00:05:16,065
[voices whispering indistinctly]

97
00:05:32,665 --> 00:05:33,499
[gasps]

98
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:41,090
[voices whispering indistinctly]

99
00:05:41,424 --> 00:05:42,258
[gasps]

100
00:06:11,496 --> 00:06:13,164
No sorcerers here. Looks like--

101
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:15,583
-Keep your voice down.
-Don't touch me!

102
00:06:15,917 --> 00:06:16,959
[gasps]

103
00:06:20,338 --> 00:06:22,715
For the Honor of Grayskull!

104
00:06:23,925 --> 00:06:25,635
[gasps, then yelps]

105
00:06:31,849 --> 00:06:32,934
We have to hurry!

106
00:06:38,773 --> 00:06:39,816
Hmm.

107
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:42,068
Uh, hey there, where you going?

108
00:06:42,151 --> 00:06:45,446
I'm so close to cracking
Prime's signal pattern!

109
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:47,448
But Spinnerella's chip's not enough.

110
00:06:47,532 --> 00:06:50,243
I need to find a place
with a high concentration of clones

111
00:06:50,326 --> 00:06:52,662
so I can analyze their connection
to the hivemind!

112
00:06:52,745 --> 00:06:54,163
Whoa. Wait, wait, wait.

113
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:57,166
You're just gonna walk into a place
that's crawling with clones?

114
00:06:57,583 --> 00:06:58,543
Yep!

115
00:06:58,835 --> 00:07:02,004
Ugh, there's no way I'm going to stop you
from doing this, is there?

116
00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:03,506
Nope!

117
00:07:04,882 --> 00:07:06,884
Oh, this is a terrible idea.

118
00:07:06,968 --> 00:07:10,304
Hop on. I can get you there faster,
and get you out if there's trouble.

119
00:07:10,388 --> 00:07:11,389
Works for me!

120
00:07:11,472 --> 00:07:12,723
Thanks, Bird Horse!

121
00:07:12,807 --> 00:07:16,102
For the last time, I'm not--
Just get this over with.

122
00:07:24,527 --> 00:07:26,779
[Shadow Weaver] We're here.
Follow my lead.

123
00:07:26,863 --> 00:07:29,031
Would a "please" kill you?

124
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:58,269
[Glimmer] Whoa.

125
00:07:59,937 --> 00:08:01,147
Hey, are you--?

126
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:02,064
I'm fine.

127
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:04,734
Catra, it'll be okay.

128
00:08:05,359 --> 00:08:06,194
Trust me.

129
00:08:07,778 --> 00:08:09,906
There's no time to waste.

130
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:13,242
News of our presence will have
reached the others by now after that...

131
00:08:14,035 --> 00:08:15,495
disturbance.

132
00:08:16,662 --> 00:08:18,664
Come on. We have to keep moving.

133
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,463
[Bow] What is all of this?

134
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,632
[Castaspella] We're on the right path.

135
00:08:27,715 --> 00:08:31,093
The Crystal of Arxia
was rumored to be the key

136
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:34,013
to reaching deep magic within Etheria.

137
00:08:34,096 --> 00:08:37,099
Many have tried, and failed, to find it.

138
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:39,852
But those who hungered for more power

139
00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:43,272
have long sought other ways
to obtain the deep magic...

140
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,442
with disastrous results.

141
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:51,280
The Spell of Obtainment was a mistake,
one for which I've paid the price.

142
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:53,908
I don't see why you keep bringing it up.

143
00:08:53,991 --> 00:08:57,954
You roped my brother into your twisted
dark magic when he was only a child.

144
00:08:58,037 --> 00:08:59,163
You could've killed him.

145
00:08:59,247 --> 00:09:02,500
It would've worked
had he not broken the connection.

146
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:06,170
Micah was an exceptional sorcerer,
even then.

147
00:09:06,254 --> 00:09:09,632
It's a shame it didn't run in the family.

148
00:09:22,353 --> 00:09:24,021
What is going on over there?

149
00:09:29,318 --> 00:09:31,988
The pattern is incredibly complex.

150
00:09:32,947 --> 00:09:34,490
I need more connections.

151
00:09:34,824 --> 00:09:38,286
No way! Whatever's going on here,
it's not good.

152
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:42,623
No tech is worth you
getting captured by Prime!

153
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:45,543
This isn't about tech.
It's about our chipped friends.

154
00:09:45,626 --> 00:09:49,130
If I can get this to work,
I can save them.

155
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:50,715
[groans]

156
00:09:50,798 --> 00:09:52,967
Oh, okay, but be quick.

157
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:55,720
I'll cover you from behind.
Please be careful.

158
00:10:05,563 --> 00:10:07,064
Yes! I've got it!

159
00:10:08,524 --> 00:10:09,692
Ahh.

160
00:10:10,484 --> 00:10:12,111
Uh-oh.

161
00:10:19,785 --> 00:10:22,288
-[Shadow Weaver] Wait!
-[gasps]

162
00:10:22,371 --> 00:10:23,539
Adora!

163
00:10:27,001 --> 00:10:28,711
I'm okay. I'm okay.

164
00:10:30,546 --> 00:10:32,632
Did you just jump into fire for me?

165
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:33,799
[Catra] What? No!

166
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:36,010
-[Adora laughing]
-Shut up!

167
00:10:36,093 --> 00:10:37,303
[Adora] You did.

168
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:39,847
Oh, that's good.

169
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,224
It's an illusion!

170
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:46,854
[Shadow Weaver] Some of the fire
is illusory, and some is real.

171
00:10:46,937 --> 00:10:48,689
Everyone, be careful.

172
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:17,593
[Shadow Weaver] I see you and Catra
are close again.

173
00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:23,099
Do you really think that's wise?

174
00:11:23,391 --> 00:11:25,017
It's none of your business.

175
00:11:25,101 --> 00:11:26,310
But it is.

176
00:11:26,394 --> 00:11:29,855
If your emotions are blocking you
from becoming She-Ra,

177
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:32,233
it's all of Etheria's business.

178
00:11:33,567 --> 00:11:36,862
How long has it been
since you were able to transform?

179
00:11:39,156 --> 00:11:41,951
It's been happening
ever since the Fright Zone.

180
00:11:42,284 --> 00:11:43,202
What if...?

181
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:45,579
What if I'm losing her?

182
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:50,042
She-Ra is a being of pure magic.

183
00:11:50,126 --> 00:11:54,380
To unleash her full strength,
you must be focused, clearheaded.

184
00:11:54,713 --> 00:11:57,675
But you are letting your emotions
pull you in too many directions.

185
00:11:57,758 --> 00:12:03,055
Catra, she distracts you, confuses you.

186
00:12:03,806 --> 00:12:06,058
Haven't you hurt each other enough?

187
00:12:07,268 --> 00:12:11,397
If you care about her,
focus on protecting her.

188
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:16,110
The world needs you as She-Ra right now,
not Adora.

189
00:12:16,193 --> 00:12:21,198
And if She-Ra can't stop Prime,
then we are all doomed.

190
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:25,453
I will stop Prime.

191
00:12:26,162 --> 00:12:27,538
No matter what.

192
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:32,626
[growls] Who are you?
What are you doing here?

193
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:39,133
Why do I know your face?

194
00:12:40,134 --> 00:12:41,343
Hordak?

195
00:12:42,219 --> 00:12:44,555
No, do not say that name to me.

196
00:12:44,638 --> 00:12:45,973
I have no name.

197
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:53,230
What have you done to me?

198
00:12:54,773 --> 00:12:56,817
You do remember me.

199
00:12:57,234 --> 00:12:59,028
I knew you would.

200
00:12:59,987 --> 00:13:01,322
[Swift Wind neighs]

201
00:13:01,405 --> 00:13:02,781
Get away from her!

202
00:13:03,657 --> 00:13:04,867
Entrapta, let's go!

203
00:13:09,538 --> 00:13:10,372
Go.

204
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:14,543
Maybe then these memories,
these imperfections, will leave me.

205
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:15,794
Remember!

206
00:13:15,878 --> 00:13:18,797
Your imperfections are beautiful!

207
00:13:24,178 --> 00:13:26,055
-[Castaspella gasps]
-Whoa.

208
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:27,806
[Bow] Whoa.

209
00:13:29,517 --> 00:13:31,435
[Glimmer] That is the Failsafe?

210
00:13:31,894 --> 00:13:36,524
It's bigger than I thought it'd be.
How are we gonna get that to the Heart?

211
00:13:36,607 --> 00:13:38,692
[Shadow Weaver] The Failsafe is a code.

212
00:13:38,776 --> 00:13:41,612
It's stored inside the Crystal.

213
00:13:41,695 --> 00:13:43,364
So, what do we--?

214
00:13:43,447 --> 00:13:44,782
It needs a password.

215
00:13:47,117 --> 00:13:49,495
I think you already know what it is.

216
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:51,914
We're friends of Mara.

217
00:14:02,383 --> 00:14:03,509
What does it say?

218
00:14:03,926 --> 00:14:08,180
"Someone needs to go inside
and accept the Failsafe"?

219
00:14:08,264 --> 00:14:09,473
What does that mean?

220
00:14:09,557 --> 00:14:12,810
It means the Failsafe must be bonded
to a willing soul

221
00:14:12,893 --> 00:14:17,856
and carried to the Heart of Etheria
in their body in order to be deployed.

222
00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:22,278
And we're sure that's safe?

223
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:25,990
We can't turn back now.
The Failsafe is within our grasp.

224
00:14:32,454 --> 00:14:33,956
[Catra] Adora, don't go in there.

225
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:36,709
[Shadow Weaver]
Catra, this is not the time.

226
00:14:36,792 --> 00:14:38,544
Someone must take the Failsafe.

227
00:14:38,627 --> 00:14:40,212
So, you do it, then.

228
00:14:41,964 --> 00:14:44,550
I've been watching you the whole way in.

229
00:14:44,633 --> 00:14:46,802
You've been in here before, haven't you?

230
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:48,888
You could've taken the Failsafe yourself

231
00:14:48,971 --> 00:14:50,973
and gotten all the power
you've ever wanted.

232
00:14:51,265 --> 00:14:53,142
But you didn't. Why?

233
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:54,894
You're being paranoid.

234
00:14:54,977 --> 00:14:57,229
This is the only way to stop Prime.

235
00:14:57,313 --> 00:14:59,648
Adora understands that well enough.

236
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:01,233
Why does it have to be Adora?

237
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:04,153
What is going to happen to her?
What aren't you telling us?

238
00:15:10,826 --> 00:15:12,244
Answer the question.

239
00:15:12,328 --> 00:15:13,245
[growling]

240
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:20,085
Whoever uses the Failsafe must absorb
the full magic of the Heart

241
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:21,712
when it is destroyed.

242
00:15:22,087 --> 00:15:27,593
That much raw magical power
would burn any mere mortal apart.

243
00:15:28,135 --> 00:15:29,929
None of us are strong enough.

244
00:15:30,471 --> 00:15:31,847
But She-Ra is.

245
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:35,809
Only She-Ra can hope to survive
the process.

246
00:15:35,893 --> 00:15:37,561
No one else can do it.

247
00:15:40,648 --> 00:15:42,274
And if I don't survive it?

248
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:48,322
Then the magic will be restored to Etheria
through your sacrifice.

249
00:15:49,156 --> 00:15:52,493
You will give us the power
to bring us to victory.

250
00:15:52,576 --> 00:15:54,745
Prime will be defeated.

251
00:15:55,329 --> 00:15:57,122
Your friends will be free.

252
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:02,836
-You were planning this all along!
-Why are you surprised by this?

253
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,296
It's not going to work!

254
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:06,507
There is no way
we're risking Adora like that!

255
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:09,468
[Castaspella] You're using Adora
to get the magic for yourself.

256
00:16:09,551 --> 00:16:10,928
[all shouting indistinctly]

257
00:16:11,011 --> 00:16:12,096
[Adora] Stop it!

258
00:16:14,848 --> 00:16:15,683
I'll do it.

259
00:16:16,934 --> 00:16:18,852
No. What? What's wrong with you?

260
00:16:18,936 --> 00:16:22,439
Shadow Weaver is sacrificing you.
Why can't you see that?

261
00:16:22,523 --> 00:16:25,401
Because even if she is,
it's better than Prime getting the Heart

262
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:27,236
and destroying the universe!

263
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:29,321
We're out of options.

264
00:16:30,322 --> 00:16:31,657
This is the only way.

265
00:16:32,449 --> 00:16:33,993
[voices whispering indistinctly]

266
00:16:34,785 --> 00:16:38,664
Well, look who it is.

267
00:16:44,712 --> 00:16:45,921
[Catra] Adora!

268
00:16:53,971 --> 00:16:54,805
Whoa!

269
00:16:56,557 --> 00:16:57,558
Dad!

270
00:16:57,641 --> 00:17:00,894
Hello, daughter.
I'm so pleased to see you.

271
00:17:00,978 --> 00:17:02,062
[gasps]

272
00:17:02,146 --> 00:17:03,689
And you, sister.

273
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:08,986
Her, not so much.

274
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:17,870
Glimmer!

275
00:17:18,328 --> 00:17:20,080
For the Honor of Grayskull!

276
00:17:21,206 --> 00:17:22,207
No.

277
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:37,723
We have to get out of here!

278
00:17:39,141 --> 00:17:41,435
The Failsafe! We can't!

279
00:17:46,356 --> 00:17:47,691
Adora, no!

280
00:17:47,983 --> 00:17:50,778
Please. It doesn't always have to be you!

281
00:17:53,781 --> 00:17:55,616
Adora! [yells]

282
00:18:02,289 --> 00:18:04,374
[yelling]

283
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:11,465
Ahh.

284
00:18:19,056 --> 00:18:20,057
What's happening?

285
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:21,767
[Micah laughs]

286
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:24,186
-[Glimmer] Is that--?
-Dark magic.

287
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:27,856
After all, I learned from the best.

288
00:18:28,023 --> 00:18:30,192
[gasps] Micah, no!

289
00:18:36,156 --> 00:18:38,033
[yelling]

290
00:18:42,579 --> 00:18:44,456
-[gasps]
-[groans]

291
00:18:57,761 --> 00:19:01,181
For the Honor of Grayskull!

292
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:02,891
[Micah yells]

293
00:19:11,733 --> 00:19:14,653
I've got it. I've got the Failsafe.
Let's get out of here.

294
00:19:27,499 --> 00:19:29,501
[Micah grunting]

295
00:19:39,553 --> 00:19:41,138
[voices whispering indistinctly]

296
00:20:11,251 --> 00:20:12,419
[mewing]

297
00:20:28,685 --> 00:20:29,811
Catra.

298
00:20:33,982 --> 00:20:36,026
[mewing]

299
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,074
Catra?

300
00:20:45,118 --> 00:20:46,495
Catra, stop!

301
00:20:54,294 --> 00:20:55,837
You were just gonna leave?

302
00:20:55,921 --> 00:20:57,756
I'm doing you a favor.

303
00:20:57,839 --> 00:20:59,341
I'm a distraction, right?

304
00:20:59,424 --> 00:21:03,512
Now you can go save the world without
having to worry about me confusing you.

305
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:06,098
No, that's not true.

306
00:21:06,181 --> 00:21:09,268
Don't listen to Shadow Weaver.
This isn't about her.

307
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:11,937
Why?

308
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:13,522
Why are you like this?

309
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:17,276
Why do you always have to sacrifice
everything for everyone else?

310
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:19,194
When do you get to choose?

311
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:22,155
What do you want, Adora?

312
00:21:23,573 --> 00:21:24,408
I...

313
00:21:25,492 --> 00:21:27,452
I have to do this, Catra.

314
00:21:28,036 --> 00:21:29,705
I'm the only one who can.

315
00:21:31,415 --> 00:21:32,249
Then do it.

316
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:34,084
That's what you want.

317
00:21:34,543 --> 00:21:36,044
That's what you'll always choose.

318
00:21:37,379 --> 00:21:39,256
I don't have to stay and watch it happen.

319
00:21:40,215 --> 00:21:43,093
Catra, please, stay.

320
00:21:44,011 --> 00:21:44,970
I need you.

321
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:46,680
No, you don't.

322
00:21:47,514 --> 00:21:48,515
You never have.

323
00:21:54,563 --> 00:21:56,189
Catra!

324
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:07,492
Adora, you made the right choice.

325
00:22:07,576 --> 00:22:10,871
Don't let Catra convince you otherwise.
She's never understood.

326
00:22:10,954 --> 00:22:11,788
Stop!

327
00:22:12,372 --> 00:22:14,207
I will never forgive you.

328
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:15,625
You ruin people.

329
00:22:16,043 --> 00:22:19,129
You ruin any chance
they could ever be happy.

330
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:21,715
Haven't you done enough?

331
00:22:22,674 --> 00:22:25,010
I did what I had to do.

332
00:22:25,761 --> 00:22:27,387
Keep telling yourself that.

333
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:29,639
I'm going to take the Failsafe
to the Heart,

334
00:22:29,723 --> 00:22:33,268
and I'm going to save Etheria.
But I am not doing it for you.

335
00:22:33,351 --> 00:22:37,230
I'll do everything I can to make sure
you never get your hands on the magic.
