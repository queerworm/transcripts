353
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:14,742
Sea-Ra is back in action!

354
00:17:14,825 --> 00:17:16,160
-Let's go!
-[shouts]

355
00:17:21,415 --> 00:17:22,374
[Sea Hawk] So...

356
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,501
what happened to the eye?

357
00:17:24,626 --> 00:17:26,086
[chuckles] Oh, this?

358
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:28,964
Catra scratched it out when she was 6.

359
00:17:29,339 --> 00:17:30,466
And now...

360
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:35,804
I bet she's gonna do the exact same thing
to all of you!

361
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:37,473
I don't care.

362
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:39,516
Hey! I'm threatening you!

363
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,601
I don't care!

364
00:17:41,769 --> 00:17:42,770
You know what?

365
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:46,440
It's not easy being the friendly
and upbeat guy all the time.

366
00:17:46,607 --> 00:17:48,984
And I get that it's hard
being friends sometimes.

367
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:50,486
You gotta work at it.

368
00:17:51,987 --> 00:17:55,741
So, why am I always the only one
who's willing to work at it?

369
00:17:56,116 --> 00:17:59,078
I mean, they didn't even notice I'm gone.

370
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:02,790
Do whatever you want. I don't care.

371
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:05,542
It's terrible being friends with friends.

372
00:18:05,626 --> 00:18:06,877
[scoffs] Yeesh.

373
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:09,546
-Ready at the rendezvous point.
-[radio static]

374
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:13,300
You guys gotta get this kid off my ship.
He's bringing me down.

375
00:18:14,343 --> 00:18:15,177
Scorpia?

376
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:17,930
-Scorpia. Come in.
-Force Captain Octavia!

377
00:18:18,013 --> 00:18:20,265
-We got magic incoming!
-What?

378
00:18:22,476 --> 00:18:23,352
[grunting]

379
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:27,481

386
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:55,342
Mermista! You're back in the game!

387
00:18:55,425 --> 00:18:56,635
Never felt better.

388
00:18:57,010 --> 00:18:59,221
Rescuing people is my jam.

389
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:00,597
I knew it.

390
00:19:00,681 --> 00:19:03,934
Never doubted my brilliant plan
for a moment.

391
00:19:04,017 --> 00:19:05,394
Oh, how fun--

392
00:19:06,311 --> 00:19:08,230

-No shanties!

393
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:10,649
Hit it!

394
00:19:10,732 --> 00:19:13,527
[gasps] I thought you said no shanties?

395
00:19:13,694 --> 00:19:17,406
This isn't a shanty.
It's like a rock remix. So, it's cool.

-Whatever, you goober.

Your plan was terrible.
But I'm done moping in a bathtub.

427
00:21:27,619 --> 00:21:31,790
I'm ready to fight, to destroy the Horde
and get my kingdom back.

I'm going to look for Mara's weapon.
The one she mentioned in the message.

437
00:22:01,069 --> 00:22:04,448
Maybe it can turn the tide of the war
for us. It has to.

439

Glimmer doesn't need a weapon.
She needs her friends.

No, she doesn't.
