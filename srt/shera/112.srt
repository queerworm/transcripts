00:00:16,266 --> 00:00:17,600
[yelling]

00:00:18,268 --> 00:00:21,438
-[Light Hope] <i>Hello, Adora.</i>
-[Hordak] <i>Adora.</i>

3
00:00:21,563 --> 00:00:22,856
[all laughing]

4
00:00:22,981 --> 00:00:25,442
[Catra] <i>Every hero needs a sidekick.</i>

5
00:00:25,525 --> 00:00:28,862
-[Adora] <i>For the honor of Grayskull!</i>
-[Entrapta] <i>I need a little more time.</i>

6
00:00:28,945 --> 00:00:30,655
[screams]

7
00:00:31,448 --> 00:00:32,574
[screams]

8
00:00:36,786 --> 00:00:39,456
<i>-Hello, Adora, you've come at last.</i>
-[shrieks]

9
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:42,417
{\an8}Light Hope,
I can't believe I'm really seeing you.

10
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:45,253
{\an8}I mean, I've seen you... [chuckles]
In my brain, I think.

11
00:00:45,336 --> 00:00:49,215
{\an8}But this is real! [chuckles]
Is this real? Wait, am I dead?

12
00:00:49,299 --> 00:00:51,885
{\an8}I fell... I'm sorry. I'm freaking out.

13
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:55,180
{\an8}-[clears throat] I'm Adora.
<i>-Yes, I know.</i>

14
00:00:55,263 --> 00:00:57,891
{\an8}<i>I have been waiting for you</i>
<i>since you were an infant,</i>

15
00:00:57,974 --> 00:00:59,559
{\an8}<i>but I could not reach you.</i>

16
00:00:59,642 --> 00:01:02,228
{\an8}<i>And I could not protect you</i>
<i>from the Horde.</i>

17
00:01:02,645 --> 00:01:04,898
{\an8}<i>I watched you grow up from afar.</i>

18
00:01:05,231 --> 00:01:07,901
Wow, that's--
That's kinda creepy, honestly.

19
00:01:07,984 --> 00:01:11,237
<i>Creepy? Yes.</i>
<i>I have been called this before.</i>

20
00:01:11,321 --> 00:01:14,491
<i>I chose this form so as not to alarm you.</i>

21
00:01:14,574 --> 00:01:18,244
<i>But if it doesn't suit you,</i>
<i>I will choose another.</i>

22
00:01:18,828 --> 00:01:20,121
<i>-Is this better?</i>
-[shrieks]

23
00:01:20,789 --> 00:01:24,042
Oh, no. That's, um--
That's actually way worse.

24
00:01:24,125 --> 00:01:28,379
<i>Forgive me. My human protocol</i>
<i>is many years out of date.</i>

25
00:01:28,463 --> 00:01:32,717
<i>Allow me to select a new form</i>
<i>that you will find appealing.</i>

26
00:01:32,801 --> 00:01:35,011
Oh, no. Thank you. That's enough.

27
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:38,473
No, that's totally okay.
Please stop. [groans]

But shouldn't she be... [grunting]
back by now?

38
00:02:15,927 --> 00:02:19,514
She said she was... [groans]
going to get training to... [groans]

39
00:02:19,597 --> 00:02:20,515
fix me!

40
00:02:20,598 --> 00:02:23,351
How long is that going to take? Ow!

41
00:02:24,018 --> 00:02:26,896
And what kind of monster
puts a chair here?

42
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:28,606
Okay. I'm worried, too, Glimmer,

43
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:31,609
but taking it out on the furniture
isn't going to help.

44
00:02:31,693 --> 00:02:35,280
We can't sit here
and hope that she comes back eventually.

45
00:02:35,363 --> 00:02:37,782
-We have to do something.
-Like what?

46
00:02:37,866 --> 00:02:39,367
[knocking on door]

47
00:02:40,743 --> 00:02:44,289
Princess, there's, uh,
something here to see you.

48
00:02:44,372 --> 00:02:48,168
-Don't you mean someone?
-No, I mean something.

49
00:02:50,712 --> 00:02:51,671
[whinnies]

50
00:02:53,047 --> 00:02:54,549
Our horse!

51
00:02:55,049 --> 00:02:57,260
I am my own horse.

52
00:02:57,343 --> 00:02:59,888
Call me Swift Wind.

53
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:03,057
[both scream]

54
00:03:03,141 --> 00:03:05,101
Our horse can talk!

55
00:03:06,102 --> 00:03:09,355
I can speak my mind now, pretty crazy.
So, I'm thinking...

56
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:12,942
-He's a talking horse!
-As we've established now.

57
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:14,861
He has wings!

58
00:03:14,944 --> 00:03:17,780
Okay, I'll give you a moment to freak out,
and then we need to talk.

59
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:18,865
[both gasping]

60
00:03:19,324 --> 00:03:20,366
[blusters] Great.

61
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:23,411
I think Adora needs our help.
Since Adora transformed me,

62
00:03:23,494 --> 00:03:27,123
I've been able to feel where she is
at all times. It's like instinct.

63
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:30,793
But now I feel a pull,
as if I'm being summoned to her side.

64
00:03:31,085 --> 00:03:34,255
As part of Adora's herd, I need your help.
Will you come?

65
00:03:36,424 --> 00:03:39,427
-Of course. Lead the way.
-But Glimmer, your glitching.

66
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:43,306
Is what got us into this.
Adora left to save me.

67
00:03:43,556 --> 00:03:46,517
Now it's time for us to save her. You in?

68
00:03:46,601 --> 00:03:50,271
Always. But I don't think
your mom is going to like us

69
00:03:50,355 --> 00:03:52,815
leaving so soon after our mission.

70
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:55,401
She doesn't need to know.
We'll sneak out and be back

71
00:03:55,485 --> 00:03:58,112
before my mom even realizes we're gone.

72
00:03:58,196 --> 00:03:59,530
[shouts] Mom!

73
00:03:59,614 --> 00:04:01,449
-[clearing throat]
-What are you doing here?

74
00:04:01,532 --> 00:04:05,078
Coming to see why my guard
was escorting a horse into your room.

75
00:04:05,161 --> 00:04:09,123
I like to think of myself
more as a role model for all horse kind.

76
00:04:09,874 --> 00:04:14,045
I mean, uh, what talking horse?
What's happening?

77
00:04:14,128 --> 00:04:17,048
You should get going
if you want to track down Adora.

78
00:04:17,131 --> 00:04:18,716
You are not gonna stop us?

79
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:22,804
Glimmer, I told you I regretted giving up
after your father died.

80
00:04:22,887 --> 00:04:25,556
I will not consign you
to the same regrets.

81
00:04:28,851 --> 00:04:32,605
Commander Glimmer, I order you
to continue your mission to find Adora

82
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:34,524
and bring her back home.

83
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:36,276
Right away, Your Majesty.

84
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:37,235
Come on.

85
00:04:43,032 --> 00:04:43,950
Uh, when we're back,

86
00:04:44,033 --> 00:04:46,703
I'd like to talk about freeing
all the horses in your stables.

87
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:48,913
-I think that's--
-[grunting] Later.

88
00:04:48,997 --> 00:04:51,457
Hey, I'm still talking
to the Queen! [neighs]

89
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:52,834
Please be careful.

90
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:58,631
Okay, I-- What is going on here?

91
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:02,135
Catra, you got my note.

92
00:05:02,218 --> 00:05:04,679
The one you dropped on my head
from the air vent that says,

93
00:05:04,762 --> 00:05:05,888
"Come to my lab"?

94
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:06,973
Yes, that's the one.

95
00:05:07,056 --> 00:05:09,892
I've made great strides
in analyzing the data

96
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:13,229
from the First Ones data crystal
you brought me. Look.

97
00:05:14,647 --> 00:05:18,818
-Where did this come from?
-Oh, you know, here and there, rooms.

98
00:05:18,901 --> 00:05:20,737
Were there people in these rooms?

99
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:23,740
Well, not when I went back
to take the stuff.

100
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:26,909
[chuckles] You belong here with us.

101
00:05:27,785 --> 00:05:29,912
So, the data... [squeals]

102
00:05:30,872 --> 00:05:32,832
[whirring and chiming]

103
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:37,462
Ha! [laughing] Wow. Whoa.

104
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:40,465
[Entrapta]
Look at these readings. Incredible.

105
00:05:40,548 --> 00:05:42,008
This seems to confirm my theories

106
00:05:42,091 --> 00:05:44,510
about the techno-organic nature
of First Ones machinery,

107
00:05:44,594 --> 00:05:47,472
resulting in thaumaturlogical
compatibility between magic and science!

108
00:05:47,555 --> 00:05:49,057
[laughing]

109
00:05:49,432 --> 00:05:53,853
I'm going to need you to try again.
But this time, talk like a normal person.

110
00:05:54,228 --> 00:05:56,356
Scorpia seems like she understands.

111
00:05:57,273 --> 00:06:00,276
Scorpia is drawing stick figures
holding hands.

112
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,779
I call it Super Pal Trio.

113
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:04,697
This is me, this is Catra,

114
00:06:04,781 --> 00:06:07,909
and I think it's clear.
Come on. I'm a bit of an artist.

115
00:06:08,826 --> 00:06:10,953
I looked at the rock,

116
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:15,833
which is a crystal, and used math.

117
00:06:15,917 --> 00:06:18,920
-Wait, do I have to explain math to you?
-[groans]

118
00:06:19,003 --> 00:06:24,717
Yes or no, did that crystal give you
enough data to upgrade our weapons?

119
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:26,552
Weapons? Ha!

120
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:29,222
This is so much bigger than weapons.

121
00:06:29,305 --> 00:06:31,641
This could change everything.

122
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:34,394
Etheria's not just a planet.

123
00:06:34,477 --> 00:06:38,439
Whatever the First Ones did to it,
it went deep.

124
00:06:38,523 --> 00:06:40,233
And what does that mean?

125
00:06:40,316 --> 00:06:43,027
You're asking me about my theories?

126
00:06:43,111 --> 00:06:46,572
I've waited years for someone to ask me
about my theories.

127
00:06:46,656 --> 00:06:49,200
-Hang on. I made a model.
-[Catra grunts]

128
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:55,164
I don't wanna be rude, but, um,
who are you?

129
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:58,584
<i>I am Light Hope, Etheria's facilitator.</i>

130
00:06:58,668 --> 00:07:02,672
<i>I was created by the First Ones,</i>
<i>as you call them.</i>

131
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:06,676
Okay, quick follow-up,
who are the First Ones?

132
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:08,845
<i>The First Ones were explorers</i>

133
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:12,265
<i>who journeyed from beyond the stars</i>
<i>to settle Etheria.</i>

134
00:07:12,348 --> 00:07:16,227
<i>They built this place for you,</i>
<i>the Crystal Castle.</i>

135
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:19,897
-[shouts]
-<i>Adora, I have waited so long for you.</i>

136
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:23,818
<i>Now the time has come</i>
<i>to show you your destiny.</i>

137
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:28,656
-Great. I actually had a quest--
<i>-You are She-Ra, Etheria's champion,</i>

138
00:07:28,739 --> 00:07:32,243
<i>appointed by the First Ones</i>
<i>to protect and unite our planet.</i>

139
00:07:32,326 --> 00:07:35,997
<i>There have been many before you.</i>
<i>But the line was broken.</i>

140
00:07:36,247 --> 00:07:39,625
<i>You are the first She-Ra</i>
<i>in a thousand years.</i>

141
00:07:40,084 --> 00:07:42,753
Behold, Etheria.

142
00:07:43,337 --> 00:07:46,340
The First Ones didn't just settle
on the surface of Etheria.

143
00:07:46,757 --> 00:07:49,844
Their technology runs
throughout the planets core.

144
00:07:49,927 --> 00:07:54,974
This whole planet,
it's all First Ones tech.

145
00:07:55,057 --> 00:07:58,060
<i>Everything on Etheria is connected.</i>

146
00:07:58,144 --> 00:08:01,481
<i>The princesses are granted power</i>
<i>over the elements</i>

147
00:08:01,564 --> 00:08:02,815
<i>through their Runestones.</i>

148
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:06,736
<i>As She-Ra, it is your duty</i>
<i>to bring the princesses together.</i>

149
00:08:07,111 --> 00:08:11,073
<i>Only then can balance</i>
<i>be restored to Etheria.</i>

150
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:17,079
-That sounds great, but the thing is--
<i>-You're correct. It is great.</i>

151
00:08:17,747 --> 00:08:20,291
-And what are these supposed to be?
-Runestones.

152
00:08:20,374 --> 00:08:21,959
From the data I've managed to extract,

153
00:08:22,043 --> 00:08:24,128
they regulate the planet
through the princesses.

154
00:08:24,212 --> 00:08:27,381
They're directly connected to each other
and to the planet's power grid

155
00:08:27,465 --> 00:08:30,760
-in a delicate balance.
-Which means?

156
00:08:31,385 --> 00:08:37,433
Which means, they're our best
access point to hack the planet.

157
00:08:37,808 --> 00:08:41,020
[Light Hope] <i>When the princesses</i>
<i>and their elements are in balance,</i>

158
00:08:41,103 --> 00:08:43,272
<i>Etheria functions as it should.</i>

159
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:46,692
<i>But the Horde is destroying us</i>
<i>in their quest for power.</i>

160
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:52,240
<i>There is no predicting</i>
<i>what they will do next.</i>

161
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:56,202
-Hack the planet?
-Hypothetically. But it's not so simple.

162
00:08:56,285 --> 00:08:59,038
There's only a handful of Runestones
in the whole world.

163
00:08:59,121 --> 00:09:01,791
Runestone?
You mean, like the Black Garnet?

164
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:04,544
'Cause... [chuckles]
we have the Black Garnet.

165
00:09:04,627 --> 00:09:07,171
The Black Garnet? You have a Runestone?

166
00:09:07,255 --> 00:09:09,549
The Fright Zone has a Runestone?

167
00:09:09,632 --> 00:09:11,801
Uh, duh. It was my family's.

168
00:09:11,884 --> 00:09:13,970
But when the Horde landed,
we gave it to Hordak,

169
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:15,721
who then gave it to Shadow Weaver, who--

170
00:09:15,805 --> 00:09:18,683
You tell a friend, he tells a friend,
it's one of those things.

171
00:09:18,766 --> 00:09:21,978
Where is it? Can I see it, touch it?

172
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:23,229
Okay, calm down.

173
00:09:23,312 --> 00:09:25,898
What exactly are you planning
on doing to the Black Garnet?

174
00:09:25,982 --> 00:09:27,608
If we hack the Runestone grid,

175
00:09:27,692 --> 00:09:31,070
we could boost the Garnet's power
and use it for... Well, anything.

176
00:09:31,153 --> 00:09:33,281
-As power source, as--
-A weapon?

177
00:09:33,364 --> 00:09:34,323
Potentially.

178
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:37,910
But if it's like my other experiments,
the results will be explosive.

179
00:09:38,327 --> 00:09:40,246
I don't think Shadow Weaver
will like that.

180
00:09:40,788 --> 00:09:43,416
Scorpia's right.
Shadow Weaver won't like it.

181
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:47,753
So, I will absolutely get you
the Black Garnet.

182
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:49,088
Leave it all to me.

183
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:57,638
What do you have for me, little spy?

184
00:09:58,139 --> 00:10:01,434
[Entrapta on recording] <i>Catra, I've made</i>
<i>great strides in analyzing the data</i>

185
00:10:01,517 --> 00:10:04,145
<i>from the First Ones data crystal. Look.</i>

186
00:10:05,146 --> 00:10:08,399
This is all super good information, um,
and I can't wait to hear more. [chuckles]

187
00:10:08,482 --> 00:10:11,569
-Just one thing, though--
-<i>Is there something you do not understand?</i>

188
00:10:11,652 --> 00:10:14,155
<i>I can start again</i>
<i>from the beginning if you would like.</i>

189
00:10:14,238 --> 00:10:15,615
[groans]

190
00:10:15,698 --> 00:10:18,659
<i>-I am Light Hope, Etheria's facilitator.</i>
-Ugh.

191
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:21,329
[shouts] No, no. I got it.

192
00:10:21,412 --> 00:10:23,205
<i>Have I mentioned that you are chosen?</i>

193
00:10:24,415 --> 00:10:28,169
Can we skip to the part about my powers?
I need to learn how to heal my friend.

194
00:10:28,252 --> 00:10:30,171
<i>Your friend?</i>

195
00:10:30,254 --> 00:10:33,966
Yes. Shadow Weaver did something
to Glimmer and took her powers away.

196
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:36,093
I need to figure out how to heal her.

197
00:10:36,177 --> 00:10:39,013
<i>Her connection with her Runestone</i>
<i>was disrupted.</i>

198
00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:40,598
Can I fix it?

199
00:10:40,681 --> 00:10:45,102
<i>You will be able to do</i>
<i>many incredible things with training.</i>

200
00:10:45,186 --> 00:10:48,606
Great. So, uh, how long will this take?
Like a day or--?

201
00:10:48,689 --> 00:10:49,774
Years.

202
00:10:49,857 --> 00:10:52,401
Years? Glimmer doesn't have years.

203
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:54,570
She's hurt because of me. I messed up.

204
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:58,908
I got Glimmer and Bow captured,
and Entrapta-- It's my fault.

205
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:01,369
I have to fix it.

206
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:05,623
<i>Yes. Your mission is to fix the planet.</i>

207
00:11:05,706 --> 00:11:09,293
My mission is to help my friends.
That's why I came here.

208
00:11:09,377 --> 00:11:13,464
<i>You are She-Ra.</i>
<i>Your purpose is to protect all of Etheria.</i>

209
00:11:13,547 --> 00:11:17,009
<i>-You cannot help only your friends.</i>
-Why can't I do both?

210
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:20,429
<i>Adora, you do not yet realize</i>
<i>the power you have.</i>

211
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:22,765
<i>You are distracted by your attachments.</i>

212
00:11:22,848 --> 00:11:27,978
<i>There was one before you</i>
<i>who could not let go. Her name was Mara.</i>

213
00:11:30,064 --> 00:11:33,734
Mara? Madame Razz's Mara?
What happened to her?

214
00:11:33,818 --> 00:11:36,654
[Light Hope] <i>Mara was</i>
<i>the last She-Ra before you.</i>

215
00:11:36,737 --> 00:11:39,865
<i>She struggled with a power</i>
<i>that she could not control</i>

216
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:43,285
<i>until it became too much for her mind.</i>

217
00:11:44,578 --> 00:11:47,456
-She snapped?
<i>-She was compromised.</i>

218
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:50,167
<i>She gave in to fear and faulty reasoning.</i>

219
00:11:50,251 --> 00:11:53,087
<i>Her desperate actions led to devastation.</i>

220
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:57,216
<i>Mara stranded us in the empty dimension</i>
<i>of Despandos.</i>

221
00:11:57,758 --> 00:11:59,635
<i>She broke the She-Ra line.</i>

222
00:11:59,927 --> 00:12:01,345
<i>She nearly destroyed us.</i>

223
00:12:01,804 --> 00:12:06,183
<i>Adora, I have waited here</i>
<i>for a thousand years alone.</i>

224
00:12:06,267 --> 00:12:09,395
<i>I did not know if I would ever see</i>
<i>another She-Ra.</i>

225
00:12:09,478 --> 00:12:11,355
<i>You must stay here and train,</i>

226
00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:14,775
<i>learn to be the She-Ra</i>
<i>that Mara could not be.</i>

227
00:12:14,859 --> 00:12:17,278
I will. I will do whatever you want.

228
00:12:17,361 --> 00:12:20,030
I'll come back and train,
and learn about everything.

229
00:12:20,114 --> 00:12:24,368
But I have to heal Glimmer first.
I can save the planet and save her.

230
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:27,830
[gasps]

231
00:12:28,914 --> 00:12:30,458
[shouting]

232
00:12:31,709 --> 00:12:32,543
[Catra] <i>Adora?</i>

233
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:39,049
<i>I just need a little more time.</i>

234
00:12:39,467 --> 00:12:42,136
[Light Hope]
<i>You feel guilt at these memories.</i>

235
00:12:43,888 --> 00:12:47,308
<i>As you said, your friends are endangered</i>
<i>by your presence.</i>

236
00:12:47,391 --> 00:12:49,226
<i>It is better to let go now.</i>

237
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:52,271
But I can't just leave my friends.

238
00:12:58,986 --> 00:13:02,406
Alright, hurry it up. Those machines
aren't going to hook up themselves.

239
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:05,159
[Shadow Weaver]
They won't be hooked up at all.

240
00:13:05,242 --> 00:13:07,578
Shadow Weaver. We just-- Uh--

241
00:13:07,661 --> 00:13:08,746
Silence!

242
00:13:08,829 --> 00:13:13,209
Did you really think you could invade
my inner sanctum without me noticing?

243
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:15,961
I never thought you were so bold
as to openly rebel,

244
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:20,341
but it'll be my pleasure
to put you back in your place.

245
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:24,303
[both groaning]

246
00:13:24,386 --> 00:13:25,596
[robot chimes]

247
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:27,515
Oh, Shadow Weaver,

248
00:13:27,598 --> 00:13:30,017
I can do whatever I want
with this hunk of rock.

249
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:31,602
[chuckles] Absurd.

250
00:13:31,685 --> 00:13:34,688
-By whose authority?
-[Hordak] <i>By mine.</i>

251
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:40,152
Lord Hordak, I don't understand.

252
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:42,154
<i>Catra and Entrapta have been working</i>

253
00:13:42,238 --> 00:13:45,449
<i>on a way to meld</i>
<i>this strange First Ones tech</i>

254
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:47,993
<i>with our machines, to weaponize it.</i>

255
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:50,746
<i>I found out and was intrigued.</i>

256
00:13:50,996 --> 00:13:55,292
<i>I gave Force Captain Catra</i>
<i>and her team my blessing to go ahead.</i>

257
00:13:55,751 --> 00:13:58,420
<i>So, understand, Shadow Weaver.</i>

258
00:13:58,504 --> 00:14:01,340
<i>I'm displeased with your interruption.</i>

259
00:14:01,423 --> 00:14:07,763
My Lord, you're really going to let this--
this princess tinker with my Runestone?

260
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:11,892
<i>Her tinkering has boosted the firepower</i>
<i>of every weapon she's touched.</i>

261
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:15,521
<i>So yes, she gets to tinker</i>
<i>with whatever she wants.</i>

262
00:14:15,604 --> 00:14:19,567
<i>Including the Black Garnet,</i>
<i>which is mine to give or take</i>

263
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:20,776
<i>as I see fit.</i>

264
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:23,070
You can't. You can't do this!

265
00:14:23,153 --> 00:14:25,489
I alone have learned
how to draw power from it,

266
00:14:25,573 --> 00:14:28,367
a feat no sorceress has done before.

267
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:30,703
I have unlocked its potential!

268
00:14:30,786 --> 00:14:33,330
<i>And you wasted it on parlor tricks.</i>

269
00:14:33,414 --> 00:14:37,751
<i>Force Captain Catra, proceed.</i>
<i>The Garnet is yours.</i>

270
00:14:37,835 --> 00:14:40,212
-Yes, Lord Hordak.
-No!

271
00:14:45,676 --> 00:14:50,097
-Stop her! Don't let her--
-You won't take what is mine!

272
00:14:54,643 --> 00:14:55,561
[grunts]

273
00:14:55,644 --> 00:14:57,021
[yelling]

274
00:15:05,195 --> 00:15:06,739
That's right, run away.

275
00:15:06,822 --> 00:15:09,533
It's the only thing
you've ever been good at.

276
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:14,788
You've always been a disappointment.
You've learned nothing from me.

277
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:18,417
Oh, no. I've learned everything from you.

278
00:15:19,168 --> 00:15:24,423
How to predict when you'll strike,
how to dodge, how to resist.

279
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:28,469
You thought you were punishing me
all these years? Wrong.

280
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:32,222
You were training me for this day!

281
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:37,436
[Shadow Weaver] No!

282
00:15:41,231 --> 00:15:42,232
[groans]

283
00:15:45,402 --> 00:15:46,487
Come back.

284
00:15:46,904 --> 00:15:49,740
Come back to me. Come back to me.

285
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:54,119
Scorpia, restrain the sorceress.

286
00:15:55,162 --> 00:15:58,123
We won't have to worry
about her any longer.

287
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:03,170
Entrapta, if you would.

288
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:06,590
[robot whirring]

289
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:12,429
All right, everyone, let's get weird.

290
00:16:21,146 --> 00:16:22,773
[gasps] Look.

291
00:16:36,954 --> 00:16:40,499
And then I realized I'm free,
but the other horses aren't.

292
00:16:40,582 --> 00:16:44,420
So I named myself Swift Wind
after the swift winds of revolution

293
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:47,256
and left to go kick down stable doors.

294
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:50,175
-Freedom, equality and hay for all.
-[rustling]

295
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:51,510
Do you hear that?

296
00:16:57,516 --> 00:16:58,600
[grunting]

297
00:17:03,188 --> 00:17:04,189
[shrieks]

298
00:17:04,481 --> 00:17:05,315
Get behind me.

299
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:11,947
What was that about?

300
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:14,825
I feel something.

301
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:16,452
We should run.

302
00:17:16,827 --> 00:17:20,164
No. We have to get Adora.
Adora, then run.

303
00:17:20,247 --> 00:17:21,832
Swift Wind, what is it?

304
00:17:21,915 --> 00:17:24,585
A bad thing. Hurry. [whimpers]

305
00:17:29,798 --> 00:17:32,634
Amazing. The garnet is siphoning energy

306
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:34,887
at a near exponential rate.

307
00:17:35,429 --> 00:17:38,474
Yet the output is still building.

308
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:39,808
What does that mean?

309
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:43,479
It means things are getting interesting.

310
00:17:44,521 --> 00:17:47,232
Is it just me or is it really cold?

311
00:17:47,316 --> 00:17:48,817
[wind blowing]

312
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:52,821
-It's snowing?
-That's impossible.

313
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:55,074
It never snows in the Whispering Woods.

314
00:17:55,157 --> 00:17:56,158
[explosion]

315
00:17:56,241 --> 00:17:57,785
[grunting]

316
00:17:57,868 --> 00:17:59,828
-What's happening?
-The bad thing.

317
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:03,749
We can't stay here.

318
00:18:03,832 --> 00:18:06,251
Swift Wind, do you sense Adora?

319
00:18:06,877 --> 00:18:07,836
[grunts]

320
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:10,923
There! She's over there.

321
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:23,018
[grunting]

322
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:26,355
This would be a great time
for my powers to come back.

323
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:30,109
Wait, wait. I know this.
Hang on. I think I can...

324
00:18:43,914 --> 00:18:45,332
[neighing]

325
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:49,545
What is that?

326
00:18:50,671 --> 00:18:52,339
Uh... This way.

327
00:18:54,842 --> 00:18:56,844
-Adora!
-Adora, we're here.

328
00:18:56,927 --> 00:18:58,011
Wake up.

329
00:19:01,014 --> 00:19:03,433
I think I can reach her. Hold on.

330
00:19:03,892 --> 00:19:04,768
Swift Wind?

331
00:19:05,102 --> 00:19:06,854
Uh... Glimmer?

332
00:19:08,772 --> 00:19:10,107
[both scream]

333
00:19:12,943 --> 00:19:14,194
[gasps]

334
00:19:14,278 --> 00:19:19,116
[distorted]<i> The Horde is hurting us.</i>
<i>Balance Etheria.</i>

335
00:19:19,199 --> 00:19:21,368
Light Hope? Light Hope, come back.

336
00:19:21,869 --> 00:19:25,664
-I don't know what to do.
-[Swift Wind] <i>Adora?</i>

337
00:19:26,123 --> 00:19:27,457
<i>Adora?</i>

338
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:31,128
Our horse?

339
00:19:31,211 --> 00:19:33,630
Once again, I'm no one's horse.

340
00:19:33,714 --> 00:19:34,882
I'm Swift Wind.

341
00:19:34,965 --> 00:19:37,593
-You can talk?
-Yes, I can talk.

342
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:38,635
You can talk?

343
00:19:39,761 --> 00:19:42,014
I can see why you're friends
with Bow and Glimmer.

344
00:19:42,431 --> 00:19:44,516
They need your help,
which is why I'm here.

345
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:47,227
-So, which way's the exit?
-I don't know.

346
00:19:47,311 --> 00:19:50,856
Light Hope disappeared and I--
I don't know if I should go.

347
00:19:50,939 --> 00:19:51,899
What do you mean?

348
00:19:51,982 --> 00:19:54,651
Light Hope said if I leave here,
I'll make things worse.

349
00:19:54,735 --> 00:19:58,947
She's right. Everyone will be better off
if I just stay far away from them.

350
00:19:59,239 --> 00:20:00,282
It's for the greater good.

351
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:02,159
Well, that's stupid.

352
00:20:02,242 --> 00:20:03,744
What? No, it's not.

353
00:20:03,827 --> 00:20:07,748
Adora, I've had the ability to form
complex thought for like a week,

354
00:20:07,831 --> 00:20:09,875
and even I know you can't help by hiding.

355
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:13,795
Where would all the horses I freed be
if I just sat in a pasture and moped?

356
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:16,465
[scoffs] I'm not moping.

357
00:20:17,257 --> 00:20:18,300
[blusters]

358
00:20:19,134 --> 00:20:22,804
I'm not. I hurt people,
I ruined my friends' lives.

359
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:26,058
If that's true, then why are Bow
and Glimmer here trying to rescue you?

360
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:30,604
Bow and Glimmer are risking their lives.

361
00:20:30,687 --> 00:20:33,649
Not because you're She-Ra,
but because you're their friend.

362
00:20:34,483 --> 00:20:35,734
What good is all your power

363
00:20:35,817 --> 00:20:38,195
if you don't use it
to help the people that you love?

364
00:20:40,948 --> 00:20:44,451
I'm not Mara.
I'm not the She-Ras of the past.

365
00:20:44,534 --> 00:20:46,912
I didn't do this to fulfill some destiny.

366
00:20:46,995 --> 00:20:49,164
I became She-Ra to help others.

367
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:53,919
My attachments,
my friends are a part of who I am.

368
00:20:54,002 --> 00:20:56,588
So, are you staying or going?

369
00:20:59,132 --> 00:21:00,217
Let's go.

370
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:12,396
Adora, you're back.

371
00:21:13,063 --> 00:21:15,232
Adora, spiders!

372
00:21:17,401 --> 00:21:19,903
For the honor of Grayskull!

373
00:21:19,987 --> 00:21:21,154
[echoing]

374
00:21:33,667 --> 00:21:35,460
[shouting and grunting]

375
00:21:44,261 --> 00:21:45,929
[both laughing]

376
00:21:46,013 --> 00:21:46,888
[neighs]

377
00:22:04,364 --> 00:22:06,283
-Now, Swifty.
-Hold on.

378
00:22:06,742 --> 00:22:07,784
[all shouting]

379
00:22:09,745 --> 00:22:11,079
Guys, look.

380
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:19,046
-It's not just the woods, it's...
-It's the entire world.

381
00:22:19,546 --> 00:22:22,466
Bright Moon. Swift Wind, hurry.

382
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:32,934
Wow. [gasps]

383
00:22:34,269 --> 00:22:36,855
-What do you think it's doing?
-I don't know.

384
00:22:37,773 --> 00:22:39,316
But I can work with this.
