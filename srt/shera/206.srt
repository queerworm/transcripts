00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:42,751
[bleating]

2
00:00:49,132 --> 00:00:50,592
[groaning]

3
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,265
[all laughing]

4
00:00:58,725 --> 00:01:00,643
{\an8}[Light Spinner] Impressive casting, Micah.

5
00:01:00,727 --> 00:01:03,688
{\an8}But you allowed yourself
to become distracted.

6
00:01:03,772 --> 00:01:04,981
{\an8}[both] Ooh.

7
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:08,234
You can't expect me
to out-cast Light Spinner,

8
00:01:08,318 --> 00:01:10,987
{\an8}the greatest sorcerer to ever walk
the halls Mystacor.

9
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:13,448
{\an8}[Light Spinner]
I've no time for your flattery.

10
00:01:13,531 --> 00:01:18,036
{\an8}If you're going to interrupt my lessons,
you might at least apply yourself.

11
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:22,165
I want focus
as you conjure your own illusions.

12
00:01:22,248 --> 00:01:25,293
{\an8}-Light Spinner, wait.
-[Light Spinner] What is it?

13
00:01:25,376 --> 00:01:30,507
{\an8}I'm bored. I've been doing light illusions
since before I can even remember.

14
00:01:32,175 --> 00:01:36,095
Teach me something real. I wanna
levitate, and travel through mirrors,

15
00:01:36,179 --> 00:01:38,598
and shapeshift. You know, the cool stuff.

16
00:01:38,681 --> 00:01:42,352
The Guild forbids third-years
from learning such things.

17
00:01:42,435 --> 00:01:44,103
You know that, Micah.

18
00:01:44,187 --> 00:01:48,691
The Guild of Sorcerers prides itself
on being out-of-touch geezers.

19
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:52,320
We wouldn't want anyone to learn
actual magic

20
00:01:52,403 --> 00:01:53,655
or anything fun.

21
00:01:53,738 --> 00:01:58,743
-That's a poor likeness of Master Norwyn.
-Then teach me shapeshifting.

22
00:01:58,827 --> 00:02:02,622
[Light Spinner] Patience, Micah.
You must start at the beginning.

23
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:12,423
Why do you bother?
You're never getting out of this cell.

[shouts]

34
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:14,068
[sighs]

35
00:03:15,945 --> 00:03:17,322
Lord Hordak? [gasps]

36
00:03:19,073 --> 00:03:21,868
[Hordak] Why is Shadow Weaver
still in the Fright Zone?

37
00:03:21,951 --> 00:03:24,120
She's-- She's my prisoner.

38
00:03:24,203 --> 00:03:28,374
[Hordak] A dangerous one.
I want her banished to Beast Island.

39
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:29,542
What?

40
00:03:30,418 --> 00:03:31,544
[groans]

41
00:03:31,836 --> 00:03:35,715
Lord Hordak, Shadow Weaver is still useful
to us if we can get her to talk.

42
00:03:35,798 --> 00:03:37,926
She knows about Etheria than anyone else.

43
00:03:38,009 --> 00:03:40,303
And also about the Fright Zone.

44
00:03:40,386 --> 00:03:42,055
Have you considered the consequences

45
00:03:42,138 --> 00:03:44,807
if that information
were to fall into the wrong hands?

46
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:46,309
That won't happen.

47
00:03:46,392 --> 00:03:51,064
Without the Black Garnet, she's completely
powerless. I can handle her. [gasps]

48
00:03:53,816 --> 00:03:54,734
[shouts]

49
00:03:55,401 --> 00:03:58,112
Oh. Hi, Catra. What are you doing here?

50
00:03:58,196 --> 00:04:01,074
I'm a Force Captain.
What are you doing here?

51
00:04:01,157 --> 00:04:04,452
I've been integrating the First Ones' tech
we got from the Northern Reach

52
00:04:04,535 --> 00:04:06,120
into Hordak's portal mainframe.

53
00:04:06,204 --> 00:04:10,250
But it maybe slightly, completely
overloaded the Fright Zone energy grid.

54
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:14,212
We're gonna have to redesign that.

55
00:04:14,295 --> 00:04:18,800
What Entrapta is doing
does not concern you, Force Captain.

56
00:04:25,056 --> 00:04:29,852
Oh. Were you having a meeting?
Sorry, again. I guess I should be going.

57
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:31,229
No, you stay.

58
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:37,360
You have two days to extract whatever
information you can from your prisoner.

59
00:04:37,443 --> 00:04:40,697
Then you will banish her to Beast Island.

60
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:42,782
-But--
-Do you understand?

61
00:04:42,865 --> 00:04:46,411
Or do I have to make myself understood?

62
00:04:48,496 --> 00:04:51,124
No, Lord Hordak. I understand.

63
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:53,751
Good. Dismissed.

64
00:04:56,462 --> 00:04:59,632
We should be able to initiate
our first test of the portal machine

65
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:02,343
as soon as I rebuild the electrical grid.

66
00:05:03,469 --> 00:05:05,221
[door alarm buzzing]

67
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:10,310
[grunting]

68
00:05:15,481 --> 00:05:16,357
[groans]

69
00:05:21,571 --> 00:05:24,073
[gasps] You actually moved it. How?

70
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:26,326
There's magic everywhere.

71
00:05:26,409 --> 00:05:30,663
The Princesses channel powerful elemental
magic through their Runestones.

72
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:35,126
But sorcerers can learn to channel
lesser power

73
00:05:35,209 --> 00:05:37,837
through spells and incantation

74
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:41,966
after many years
of serious study and discipline.

75
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:43,676
Oh. [chuckles]

76
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:47,013
[Light Spinner] The Guild brings
those who have a talent for magic

77
00:05:47,096 --> 00:05:52,060
to study here in Mystacor.
But I only train the truly gifted.

78
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:57,857
You're one of the most talented students
I've ever seen. But you lack dedication.

79
00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:01,861
I'll prove to you that I'm worthy.
Here, I'll show you. [grunts]

80
00:06:02,236 --> 00:06:08,201
Not yet. First, you must promise
to do exactly as I say.

81
00:06:26,969 --> 00:06:28,221
Huh? [laughs]

82
00:06:43,111 --> 00:06:44,195
[laughing]

83
00:06:54,455 --> 00:06:55,414
[grunts]

84
00:07:10,179 --> 00:07:13,099
Impossible. Who else
has been teaching you?

85
00:07:13,182 --> 00:07:17,103
No one. I just did what you taught me.
Did I do something wrong?

86
00:07:17,687 --> 00:07:22,316
No. I knew you were gifted,
I just didn't realize how gifted.

87
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,653
You have incredible power.

88
00:07:26,362 --> 00:07:30,116
And I'm the one who will mold that power.

89
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:34,078
-So, you'll keep teaching me?
-Of course.

90
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:38,666
-We're going to do great things together.
-Yes.

91
00:07:38,749 --> 00:07:41,586
I mean, ahem, thank you, Light Spinner.

92
00:07:41,669 --> 00:07:45,965
The Guild needs talents like ours
more than ever before.

93
00:07:46,215 --> 00:07:49,552
Perhaps-- No, you're not ready.

94
00:07:49,844 --> 00:07:55,099
I-- I know I have a lot to learn,
but I'm ready for anything. What is it?

95
00:07:56,934 --> 00:07:58,060
[Light Spinner] Show me.

96
00:08:05,776 --> 00:08:08,613
It's awful. Why would you conjure this?

97
00:08:08,696 --> 00:08:11,491
It's no illusion.
This is really happening.

98
00:08:11,574 --> 00:08:16,954
An army has invaded our lands.
They call themselves the Horde.

99
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:20,666
The Princesses have proved ineffective
against their strength.

100
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:24,962
They've accomplished much in a short time,
more than our so-called leaders have.

101
00:08:25,046 --> 00:08:28,299
-We have to do something.
-Easy, Micah.

102
00:08:28,382 --> 00:08:31,511
The Sorcerers' Guild meets tomorrow
to decide a course of action.

103
00:08:31,594 --> 00:08:36,641
I have a plan to give us
the power needed to stop the Horde.

104
00:08:37,099 --> 00:08:41,771
I only hope that Norwyn and his followers
can see the threat as clearly as you do.

105
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:45,816
You'll make them see.
If anyone can do it, it's you.

106
00:08:53,908 --> 00:08:54,867
[grunts]

107
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:57,453
-[groans]
-[laughs]

108
00:08:57,787 --> 00:09:00,873
-How'd you find me?
-You always come here when you're upset.

109
00:09:01,165 --> 00:09:05,253
Also, I looked everywhere.
Now, what's troubling my bestie?

110
00:09:05,336 --> 00:09:09,632
-I'm not your bestie and I'm fine.
-Oh, I don't accept any of that.

111
00:09:09,715 --> 00:09:12,677
Yeah, well, get used
to not getting what you want in life.

112
00:09:13,344 --> 00:09:16,013
[sighs] Hordak is making me
send Shadow Weaver

113
00:09:16,097 --> 00:09:19,100
-to Beast Island.
-Wait. Beast Island is real?

114
00:09:19,183 --> 00:09:23,813
Oops. That's not good. Oh, shoot.
Okay, let me just fix that.

115
00:09:24,855 --> 00:09:26,482
Uh, Catra, can I get a hand?

116
00:09:27,358 --> 00:09:28,192
Catra?

117
00:09:32,697 --> 00:09:35,866
I thought Beast Island was just a story
they told to keep us in line.

118
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:39,412
Being sent there is supposed
to be a fate worse than death.

119
00:09:40,204 --> 00:09:45,710
I bet there's some nice stuff, too. Maybe
Shadow Weaver will write and tell us.

120
00:09:45,793 --> 00:09:49,005
What is wrong with you? People
don't send letters from Beast Island.

121
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:50,881
They go and never come back.

122
00:09:50,965 --> 00:09:55,052
It doesn't matter how hard I work
or what I do, Hordak doesn't trust me.

123
00:09:55,136 --> 00:09:59,473
He never listens to me. Shadow Weaver
is useful and she can help us.

124
00:09:59,557 --> 00:10:04,895
Seriously? Because she hasn't
exactly given us any information.

125
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:07,189
Why do you really wanna keep her around?

126
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:10,276
She's never been very nice to you.
I kind of thought you hated her.

127
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:13,904
You-- You wouldn't understand.

128
00:10:15,781 --> 00:10:16,741
[sighs]

129
00:10:22,538 --> 00:10:24,790
[Light Spinner] We can no longer stand by

130
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:28,753
while the Horde conquers
more and more territory.

131
00:10:28,836 --> 00:10:32,381
The Princesses have been unable
to stop them,

132
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:36,552
and now they have taken a Runestone,
the Black Garnet.

133
00:10:43,017 --> 00:10:45,728
-No.
-No. It can't be.

134
00:10:45,811 --> 00:10:48,314
[Light Spinner]
We may not have Runestones,

135
00:10:48,397 --> 00:10:52,902
but there is a way we can make ourselves
strong enough to stand against the Horde.

136
00:10:56,656 --> 00:11:01,702
Cast the Spell of Obtainment
and take power for ourselves!

137
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:05,706
What you propose is forbidden,
Light Spinner.

138
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:08,626
The Spell of Obtainment leeches power,

139
00:11:08,709 --> 00:11:11,545
turning the caster
into a magical parasite.

140
00:11:11,629 --> 00:11:17,093
-If it does not kill the caster outright.
-But I've modified the spell.

141
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:20,346
Tonight the three Moons of Enchantment
come into alignment.

142
00:11:20,429 --> 00:11:26,102
This will make all the magic of Etheria
stronger. Think of the good we'll do!

143
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:28,687
There can be no good from this.

144
00:11:28,771 --> 00:11:33,067
-So we do nothing?
-The Princesses will settle the problem.

145
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:36,487
Etheria will take care of itself
as it always done,

146
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:39,573
without resorting to twisted spells.

147
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:46,205
You know I'm right. If we don't fight,

148
00:11:46,288 --> 00:11:50,626
if we don't become stronger,
we won't have a planet to protect!

149
00:11:52,211 --> 00:11:55,756
Be satisfied with what you have,
Light Spinner.

150
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:58,551
Some power is not meant for you.

151
00:11:59,051 --> 00:12:01,053
You're all blind.

152
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:03,139
[laughing]

153
00:12:06,642 --> 00:12:07,810
What did they say?

154
00:12:07,893 --> 00:12:11,397
[Light Spinner] They refuse to lend me
their strength to do what must be done.

155
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,399
They never listen to me.

156
00:12:13,482 --> 00:12:17,486
After everything I've done,
I still haven't earned their trust.

157
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:20,322
Norwyn and those fools
don't care about magic,

158
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:22,992
they just wanna hold the rest of us back.

159
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:25,369
Then go back and make them understand.

160
00:12:25,786 --> 00:12:29,039
The Horde will destroy Etheria
if we don't stop them.

161
00:12:29,373 --> 00:12:33,419
If you want to help Etheria,
there is another way.

162
00:12:36,046 --> 00:12:38,549
Pack your bags.
You're going to Beast Island.

163
00:12:38,632 --> 00:12:41,469
Oh, that's right, heh,
you don't have anything.

164
00:12:42,303 --> 00:12:44,013
-When?
-Don't you care?

165
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:46,599
It's a death sentence.
What don't you get about that?

166
00:12:46,682 --> 00:12:49,351
You're a goner unless you can give me
a reason good enough

167
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:54,940
to convince Hordak you're worth keeping
around. Don't you have anything to say?

168
00:12:55,024 --> 00:12:56,901
Just give me something!

169
00:12:56,984 --> 00:13:00,070
I've given everything I have to the Horde.

170
00:13:00,154 --> 00:13:04,575
You really are useless.
You are getting what you deserve.

171
00:13:04,658 --> 00:13:10,247
Wait. Take pity on an old, powerless
woman. I know my days here are numbered.

172
00:13:10,331 --> 00:13:14,835
I want to see my old Sorcerer's Guild
badge one last time.

173
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:18,172
It must be among my things.
Bring it to me.

174
00:13:18,714 --> 00:13:21,967
It's the last thing
I will ever ask of you.

175
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:25,721
[Catra] You don't get
to ask things of me anymore.

176
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:37,191
The Spell of Obtainment is difficult.
You must stay focused, though.

177
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:42,571
-Once we begin casting, we cannot stop.
-Are you sure about this?

178
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:47,660
We need this power.
It's the only way to protect our people.

179
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:56,335
Do exactly as we practiced.

180
00:14:11,934 --> 00:14:13,102
[gasps]

181
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:25,906
Light Spinner, what's happening?
What is that?

182
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:27,032
[gasps]

183
00:14:29,326 --> 00:14:32,246
Hold it steady. Do not stop now.

184
00:14:43,632 --> 00:14:44,675
[grunting]

185
00:14:49,305 --> 00:14:52,433
-This-- This isn't right!
-No!

186
00:14:52,516 --> 00:14:54,143
[roaring]

187
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:56,854
[grunting and gasping]

188
00:14:59,857 --> 00:15:00,941
Light Spinner!

189
00:15:06,113 --> 00:15:06,947
[grunts]

190
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:11,619
[Light Spinner groaning]

191
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:12,828
Light Spinner!

192
00:15:14,038 --> 00:15:15,080
[grunting]

193
00:15:16,206 --> 00:15:18,918
Micah, what is the meaning of this?

194
00:15:24,298 --> 00:15:25,507
Light Spinner?

195
00:15:26,383 --> 00:15:30,596
[Light Spinner] Micah, how could you?
After everything I've taught you.

196
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:34,016
-The spell was working.
-The spell was evil.

197
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:36,769
You saw what it was doing
to the room, to us.

198
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:39,480
You've always hungered after power.

199
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:43,442
Bringing you into our ranks
was a grave mistake. [grunts]

200
00:15:43,817 --> 00:15:48,155
[Light Spinner] The only mistake was
seeking the approval of a fool like you.

201
00:15:48,238 --> 00:15:49,490
You're all weak!

202
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:51,867
None of you deserve my help.

203
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:53,452
[grunting and shouting]

204
00:16:11,887 --> 00:16:16,725
The spell worked.
I am stronger than all of you.

205
00:16:17,434 --> 00:16:18,852
[grunting]

206
00:16:18,936 --> 00:16:21,647
Light Spinner, please, don't.

207
00:16:29,947 --> 00:16:31,198
[grunting]

208
00:16:36,286 --> 00:16:37,663
[glass breaking]

209
00:16:47,965 --> 00:16:51,218
[woman] Halt. What business
do you have in the Fright Zone?

210
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:55,347
[shouting]

211
00:16:57,057 --> 00:16:59,643
[Shadow Weaver]
Tell Hordak there is someone here

212
00:16:59,727 --> 00:17:01,353
who can help take him to victory.

213
00:17:04,064 --> 00:17:06,942
So, have you come up
with anything to save your skin?

214
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:08,569
You know I haven't.

215
00:17:11,613 --> 00:17:15,200
Why do you insist
on delivering my meals yourself?

216
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:17,870
Surely, you have more
important things to do.

217
00:17:17,953 --> 00:17:22,499
-I like seeing you in shackles.
-We both know that's not the only reason.

218
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,210
What do you want, Catra?

219
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:27,504
Why...?

220
00:17:28,088 --> 00:17:29,006
[sighs]

221
00:17:29,465 --> 00:17:33,343
Why did you treat me the way you did?
Why was I never good enough?

222
00:17:33,427 --> 00:17:34,720
Really, I wanna know.

223
00:17:35,971 --> 00:17:38,557
Because you remind me of myself.

224
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:43,312
You always have.
Nothing was ever easy for me either.

225
00:17:43,395 --> 00:17:48,192
I wasn't born to power
like Adora and others.

226
00:17:48,525 --> 00:17:54,406
I had to earn my power. Fight for it.
Why should it be any different for you?

227
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:56,950
I was a child when you took me in.

228
00:17:57,034 --> 00:18:00,037
What could I have possibly done
to deserve the way you treated me?

229
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:04,208
I am nothing like you.
You are old, and bitter, and weak.

230
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:07,044
Ah. But you are like me.

231
00:18:07,294 --> 00:18:11,423
And just like me,
you're losing your position with Hordak.

232
00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:13,634
I can see that even from my cell.

233
00:18:13,717 --> 00:18:17,763
-You don't know what you're talking about.
-You're being pushed out.

234
00:18:17,846 --> 00:18:21,600
I am not. It's just Entrapta
understands all that tech stuff.

235
00:18:23,143 --> 00:18:23,977
Come here.

236
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:35,739
She's earned his trust. How did you
let this happen? Don't you see?

237
00:18:35,823 --> 00:18:40,828
I want you to go further than I did,
but you need to be smarter than me.

238
00:18:40,911 --> 00:18:43,831
-Stronger than me.
-Then help me.

239
00:18:44,248 --> 00:18:48,252
-Come up with something so you can stay.
-I will try.

240
00:18:49,253 --> 00:18:52,840
But I'm tired now.
Come back later. Please.

241
00:19:07,312 --> 00:19:08,480
[sighs]

242
00:19:13,277 --> 00:19:14,611
[baby crying]

243
00:19:25,747 --> 00:19:29,376
[Shadow Weaver] Was your excursion
successful, Lord Hordak?

244
00:19:29,918 --> 00:19:31,545
I arrived too late.

245
00:19:31,879 --> 00:19:37,509
I found something but it's useless. Put it
with the other orphans in the infirmary.

246
00:19:43,432 --> 00:19:47,978
This one is different. Can't you feel it?
She has power.

247
00:19:48,478 --> 00:19:51,481
Fine, take it. Just get it out of here.

248
00:19:59,489 --> 00:20:01,200
[Shadow Weaver] Oh. [gasps]

249
00:20:01,658 --> 00:20:07,122
Oh, don't worry, little one.
We're going to do great things together.

250
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:11,335
It's time.

251
00:20:19,927 --> 00:20:20,928
[grunting]

252
00:20:38,654 --> 00:20:39,571
[sighs]

253
00:20:40,447 --> 00:20:42,866
Uh, okay. I know it hasn't been that long,

254
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:45,744
but I figured
we could brainstorm together.

255
00:20:47,829 --> 00:20:51,333
Come on, two devious minds
such as ours are...

256
00:20:52,501 --> 00:20:53,460
Huh?

257
00:20:56,505 --> 00:20:57,381
[sighs]

258
00:20:58,257 --> 00:21:00,801
You were just using me all along.

259
00:21:01,551 --> 00:21:03,095
[grunting and shouting]

260
00:21:15,482 --> 00:21:16,608
[crying]

261
00:21:17,901 --> 00:21:18,819
[shouting]

262
00:21:24,616 --> 00:21:26,243
A little to the left.

263
00:21:26,326 --> 00:21:27,911
[grunting]

264
00:21:27,995 --> 00:21:28,829
This good?

265
00:21:28,912 --> 00:21:32,833
Better. Okay, now, Glimmer,
move yours more to the right.

266
00:21:36,461 --> 00:21:37,629
My right.

267
00:21:37,713 --> 00:21:38,672
[groans]

268
00:21:40,382 --> 00:21:41,758
Why are we...

269
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:44,594
up on the roof...

270
00:21:45,887 --> 00:21:48,390
[yawning] in the middle
of the night again?

271
00:21:48,473 --> 00:21:51,351
You know how I thought my Tracker Pad
had broken back in Alwyn?

272
00:21:51,435 --> 00:21:53,020
Well, I've been studying it,

273
00:21:53,103 --> 00:21:57,065
and I realized the garbled static
I keep getting on my screen isn't a bug.

274
00:21:57,524 --> 00:21:59,609
It's picking up some kind of transmission.

275
00:21:59,693 --> 00:22:04,031
With these three moons in alignment,
all transmissions should be stronger.

276
00:22:04,114 --> 00:22:07,284
Adora, higher and more out-ish!

277
00:22:09,619 --> 00:22:10,954
[grunting]

278
00:22:13,206 --> 00:22:14,624
-Guys?
-[Bow] Hold still!

279
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:18,545
It's working! We did it!
Guys, you gotta see this.

280
00:22:21,715 --> 00:22:24,968
-Please tell me you got the message.
-Some of it's degraded.

281
00:22:25,052 --> 00:22:28,013
-Can you read the rest?
-"Serenia.

282
00:22:28,722 --> 00:22:31,349
Portal. Mara."

283
00:22:31,933 --> 00:22:34,019
-What's a Serenia?
-I don't know.

284
00:22:34,102 --> 00:22:37,439
But if it has to do with Mara,
it can't be good.

285
00:22:41,359 --> 00:22:43,361
[closing theme playing]
