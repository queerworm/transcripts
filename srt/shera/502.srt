00:00:30,447 --> 00:00:35,243
{\an8}Rejoice, Etheria,
for Prime has come to you.

3
00:00:35,326 --> 00:00:39,706
{\an8}Do not fear,
for you have been given the opportunity

4
00:00:39,956 --> 00:00:45,045
{\an8}to share in a world
soon to be remade in my image.

5
00:00:46,171 --> 00:00:50,341
But first,
you must prove yourselves worthy.

6
00:00:51,468 --> 00:00:54,429
Your leader, your She-Ra,

7
00:00:54,971 --> 00:00:58,975
she would see you suffer in darkness
for her sake.

8
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:04,189
Cast aside this false hero
and deliver her to me.

9
00:01:05,231 --> 00:01:07,859
Prime sees all.

10
00:01:08,151 --> 00:01:10,779
Prime knows all.

11
00:01:11,362 --> 00:01:14,449
They will not escape my judgment.

12
00:01:15,408 --> 00:01:19,287
Wow... this is amazing.

13
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:23,458
Mm... And bad.

14
00:01:23,541 --> 00:01:24,834
Very bad.

[screams]

26
00:02:03,581 --> 00:02:05,041
What happened? Are you okay?

27
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:08,461
I gotta go save Glimmer.

00:02:08,628 --> 00:02:09,796
[groans]

29
00:02:10,421 --> 00:02:13,049
My body is betraying me.

30
00:02:13,675 --> 00:02:15,510
No, you're exhausted.

31
00:02:15,593 --> 00:02:17,387
That happens to regular people

32
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:20,723
when they keep throwing themselves
into battle and refusing to sleep.

33
00:02:21,474 --> 00:02:22,684
I hate it.

34
00:02:22,767 --> 00:02:25,103
Come on, you just need to rest.

35
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:27,105
[sighs]

36
00:02:27,188 --> 00:02:28,982
Now, close your eyes and--

37
00:02:29,065 --> 00:02:30,525
Is she dead?

38
00:02:30,608 --> 00:02:32,110
What? No.

39
00:02:32,193 --> 00:02:34,863
Okay, good,
'cause Adora does the planning,

40
00:02:34,946 --> 00:02:36,781
and we're wondering if there's a plan--

41
00:02:36,865 --> 00:02:39,868
Listen, the upgrades to Mara's ship
are done,

42
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:43,830
but we can't go anywhere
until Adora's back on her feet.

43
00:02:43,913 --> 00:02:45,999
So, go to sleep and everyone will--

44
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:49,002
Did someone say "Swift Wind"?

45
00:02:49,586 --> 00:02:52,672
Is Adora feeling better?
Did you tell her Horde Prime's message?

46
00:02:52,755 --> 00:02:54,674
-Does she know he's looking for her?
-What?

47
00:02:54,757 --> 00:02:56,509
Okay, that's enough.

48
00:02:56,593 --> 00:02:57,886
[Bow] Adora, rest!

49
00:02:57,969 --> 00:02:59,596
Swift Wind, head!

50
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:00,555
[grunts]

51
00:03:01,097 --> 00:03:03,016
Everyone, shh!

52
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:06,269
She will be fine soon, right?

53
00:03:06,352 --> 00:03:10,106
Yes. She just needs sleep.

54
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:16,070
[snoring softly]

55
00:03:19,157 --> 00:03:22,076
-Adora sick log, day three.
-Nope!

56
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,494
[wails]

57
00:03:24,162 --> 00:03:26,456
Wait! But it's for science!

58
00:03:26,915 --> 00:03:30,418
Look, we have to do something. We don't
know when Adora is gonna get better,

59
00:03:30,501 --> 00:03:34,422
and even when she does we have no plan
for how to get Glimmer back.

60
00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:36,382
We know she's on Horde Prime's ship,

61
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:38,968
but we don't know where that is,
like, in space.

62
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:42,305
Well, then it's up to us
to make a plan to find Glimmer.

63
00:03:42,388 --> 00:03:43,223
With these.

64
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:46,476
We don't need dolls.

65
00:03:46,684 --> 00:03:48,645
We just need these!

66
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:50,939
What are you gonna do with those?

67
00:03:51,648 --> 00:03:53,441
Punch Horde Prime.

68
00:03:54,442 --> 00:03:55,318
[clears throat]

69
00:03:55,401 --> 00:03:57,320
Perhaps if we meditate

70
00:03:57,403 --> 00:04:03,284
we can access our princess connection
to find Glimmer's spirit out in space.

71
00:04:03,368 --> 00:04:06,537
Hello. Oh, hi.
Were you guys talking about space?

72
00:04:07,121 --> 00:04:08,039
[whirs]

73
00:04:10,124 --> 00:04:14,587
Yes. We were talking
about how to get Glimmer back from spa--

74
00:04:14,671 --> 00:04:17,382
I'd do anything to go to space.

75
00:04:17,465 --> 00:04:20,718
An infinite universe of information
at our fingertips,

76
00:04:20,802 --> 00:04:26,057
full of countless planets and stars
and civilizations--

77
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:27,058
[muffled grunt]

78
00:04:27,141 --> 00:04:29,102
This isn't like a fun field trip

79
00:04:29,185 --> 00:04:31,479
for you to run more of your messed up
experiments.

80
00:04:31,562 --> 00:04:34,232
Our friend's out there. Remember?

81
00:04:35,566 --> 00:04:36,401
Glimmer?

82
00:04:38,236 --> 00:04:39,070
[groans]

83
00:04:39,153 --> 00:04:40,613
The sparkly one?

84
00:04:40,697 --> 00:04:44,075
You've met her multiple times.

85
00:04:45,618 --> 00:04:47,787
Oh, right.

86
00:04:48,663 --> 00:04:49,664
[whimpers]

87
00:04:50,081 --> 00:04:53,418
Wow... Hey, Entrapta. Look over there!

88
00:04:53,543 --> 00:04:54,669
Is that a robot?

89
00:04:54,752 --> 00:04:56,004
A robot? Where?

90
00:04:56,754 --> 00:04:58,756
[crash]

91
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:02,510
Look, I know that she can be kind of,
"Whoa, science!"

92
00:05:02,593 --> 00:05:04,762
[make explosion sound and laughs]

93
00:05:04,846 --> 00:05:07,265
But I promise, Entrapta has a good heart.

94
00:05:07,348 --> 00:05:08,933
She's betrayed us before.

95
00:05:09,017 --> 00:05:12,395
For all we know, as soon as she sees
Horde Prime's ship up close,

96
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:14,731
she'll ditch us to join his army.

97
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:18,901
She did use her inventions
to attack us a lot.

98
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:21,904
I'm just saying, none of us know
how to track a spaceship,

99
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:23,156
but Entrapta might.

100
00:05:23,239 --> 00:05:24,741
If you just give her a chance.

101
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:28,661
[clattering and groaning]

102
00:05:29,037 --> 00:05:29,912
Aah!

103
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:33,666
[groans] Fine.

104
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:37,920
Okay, Geek Princess,
are you gonna help us or not?

105
00:05:40,465 --> 00:05:41,424
[groans]

106
00:05:41,507 --> 00:05:44,761
If you help us find Glimmer,
you can go to space.

107
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:45,678
Great!

108
00:05:49,474 --> 00:05:50,516
[zing]

109
00:05:51,642 --> 00:05:53,061
Hello? Who's there?

110
00:05:57,857 --> 00:05:58,691
[grunts]

111
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:01,152
Hey! I know you're watching me!

112
00:06:07,241 --> 00:06:09,577
-[gasps]
-You should not be here.

113
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:11,287
I-- I wasn't--

114
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:14,832
Prime has decreed
that none shall speak to the queen.

115
00:06:14,999 --> 00:06:16,292
You have disobeyed.

116
00:06:16,375 --> 00:06:17,585
What does it matter?

117
00:06:17,668 --> 00:06:19,879
Prime has more important things
to worry about.

118
00:06:19,962 --> 00:06:21,756
-It's not like I--
-You unworthy wretch!

119
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:24,967
It is not for you to decide
what matters to Prime.

120
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:28,554
You are a parasite,
nothing more than the dirt beneath his--

121
00:06:28,638 --> 00:06:29,806
[chokes]

122
00:06:30,389 --> 00:06:31,891
[neck cracking]

123
00:06:35,812 --> 00:06:40,233
Little sister, why do you rebel
against my commands?

124
00:06:40,316 --> 00:06:41,150
[gasps]

125
00:06:42,276 --> 00:06:43,111
Lord Prime?

126
00:06:43,694 --> 00:06:45,696
Prime sees all, little sister.

127
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:48,366
Do not disturb the queen.

128
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:50,618
Now, run along.

129
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:14,851
[gasps]

130
00:07:17,353 --> 00:07:18,563
What?

131
00:07:34,579 --> 00:07:35,746
You again.

132
00:07:37,623 --> 00:07:39,292
Wa-- Wait!

133
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:45,381
The message from Horde Prime
was transmitted through that spire.

134
00:07:45,506 --> 00:07:47,008
Which means it's got a wavelength

135
00:07:47,091 --> 00:07:49,427
connecting it
to his main base of operation,

136
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:51,637
one that we can track.

137
00:07:51,721 --> 00:07:55,975
-Great. So, track it.
-Well, hypothetically we can track it.

138
00:07:56,058 --> 00:07:58,978
Horde Prime's astral communication network
is incredibly complex,

139
00:07:59,061 --> 00:08:00,980
and I've only been able
to intercept parts.

140
00:08:01,063 --> 00:08:03,107
I'd need to gain as much proximity
as possible

141
00:08:03,191 --> 00:08:06,110
to the receptor
before I can triangulate their origin.

142
00:08:06,194 --> 00:08:07,111
-Mm.
-Mm.

143
00:08:07,195 --> 00:08:08,029
Hm...

144
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:12,992
I need to get close to the spire

145
00:08:13,075 --> 00:08:15,828
to track the signal.

146
00:08:17,121 --> 00:08:19,624
-Got it, got it.
-If we follow that signal,

147
00:08:19,707 --> 00:08:22,960
we'll find a ship
of impossibly sophisticated design,

148
00:08:23,044 --> 00:08:26,255
the center of a super
technologically advanced empire--

149
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:30,593
I think mostly we're just hoping
to find our kidnapped friend.

150
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:35,473
That spire is crawling
with surveillance bots.

151
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:38,976
We need to find a way to sneak past them

152
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:42,146
so we can get Geek Princess
close enough to track the signal.

153
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:45,274
So, what's the plan?

154
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:47,610
Uh... that's the whole plan.

155
00:08:47,693 --> 00:08:50,154
We sneak past the surveillance bots.

156
00:08:50,446 --> 00:08:54,158
[groans] I don't know, Adora usually
handles the being-in-charge stuff.

157
00:08:54,242 --> 00:08:58,955
Okay, we sneak past the bots,
and then if any of them see us, we--

158
00:08:59,038 --> 00:09:00,414
Punch the bots!

159
00:09:00,498 --> 00:09:02,792
Sure, sounds like enough of a plan for me.

160
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:04,835
And someone needs to keep an eye on--

161
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:05,753
[humming]

162
00:09:05,836 --> 00:09:10,383
What? Did she seriously
just immediately run off?

163
00:09:10,466 --> 00:09:11,425
[groans]

164
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:14,887
[gasps]

165
00:09:15,513 --> 00:09:16,472
Your Majesty.

166
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:18,599
Thank you for joining me.

167
00:09:18,683 --> 00:09:21,018
I thought you might enjoy a diversion.

168
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:27,066
Do you like them?

169
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,402
Tokens from many worlds.

170
00:09:29,652 --> 00:09:33,239
Worlds that I brought
into my eternal light.

171
00:09:33,322 --> 00:09:35,825
Worlds you destroyed.

172
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:39,203
I take no joy in destruction,

173
00:09:39,287 --> 00:09:43,916
but the weeds must be burned away
so that new life may flourish.

174
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:47,044
This is my favorite.

175
00:09:47,128 --> 00:09:49,547
A treasure
from the first world I conquered.

176
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:52,049
It was highly prized by its people.

177
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:55,511
And now it is all that is left of them.

178
00:09:56,137 --> 00:09:58,431
You know I am searching for She-Ra.

179
00:09:58,973 --> 00:10:00,725
You seem reluctant to help me.

180
00:10:01,309 --> 00:10:03,311
But I only wish to use your weapon

181
00:10:03,394 --> 00:10:06,897
to bring peace to the darkest corners
of the universe.

182
00:10:06,981 --> 00:10:08,065
Peace?

183
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:11,902
If you activate the Heart of Etheria,
there will be no one left.

184
00:10:11,986 --> 00:10:15,197
Yes. No war, no pain.

185
00:10:15,531 --> 00:10:20,786
Old worlds swept aside,
a new beginning for the universe.

186
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:23,456
I know you understand.

187
00:10:23,664 --> 00:10:27,752
All I want to do
is what you've already done.

188
00:10:28,794 --> 00:10:30,588
No. No, that wasn't--

00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:32,632
[man grunts]

191
00:10:37,511 --> 00:10:39,096
What--? How--?

192
00:10:39,597 --> 00:10:41,849
-How?
-Do you recognize him?

193
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:45,978
Dad?

194
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:49,357
[Prime] Let me be clear, Your Majesty.

195
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,985
Your world belongs to me.

196
00:10:53,527 --> 00:10:55,946
But I am still merciful.

197
00:10:56,447 --> 00:11:00,034
Would you be reunited with your father
in my good graces?

198
00:11:00,117 --> 00:11:02,620
Would you deliver me She-Ra?

199
00:11:03,287 --> 00:11:04,121
I--

200
00:11:04,205 --> 00:11:05,915
I wanted to use the Heart of Etheria.

201
00:11:06,874 --> 00:11:11,420
I thought I could save the world,
but all I did was bring you here.

202
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:13,714
[glass shatters]

203
00:11:13,798 --> 00:11:16,550
I will never help you.

204
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:18,928
And you will never win.

205
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:27,269
Those who cling to the darkness
have made their choice.

206

00:12:00,636 --> 00:12:03,180
Well, no signal here.
We need to get closer.

212
00:12:03,264 --> 00:12:05,724
[groans] I hate the desert.

213
00:12:08,018 --> 00:12:09,895
All clear. Let's go.

214
00:12:15,484 --> 00:12:17,194
Wait. I think I'm getting something.

215
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:18,237
[bleeping]

216
00:12:19,363 --> 00:12:22,575
Entrapta, we really need
to get out of the open.

217
00:12:23,492 --> 00:12:25,786
Hang on. I've almost got it.

218
00:12:26,203 --> 00:12:27,955
I need to get up higher.

219
00:12:28,956 --> 00:12:31,500
So close, almost got it.

00:12:32,001 --> 00:12:32,835

221
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:34,795
Nope. False alarm. We need to get closer.

00:12:47,224 --> 00:12:48,893
What do we do?

226
00:12:53,355 --> 00:12:55,065
I should run?

227
00:12:58,110 --> 00:12:59,111
Don't run?

228
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:00,321
Do run?

229
00:13:03,032 --> 00:13:03,866
What?

230
00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:05,868
Entrapta.

Oh, hello.

236
00:13:31,352 --> 00:13:34,480
You're very technologically advanced.

238
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:38,108
[screams] Bad robot!

00:13:42,196 --> 00:13:43,405
Come on!

[bleeping]

241
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:55,793
What do we do?

242
00:13:57,628 --> 00:14:00,839
[groans] I don't know. This plan
was obviously doomed from the start.

243
00:14:00,923 --> 00:14:03,300
I'm not Adora.
Why did I think I could be the leader?

244
00:14:03,384 --> 00:14:04,802
[Entrapta] Well, still nothing.

245
00:14:04,885 --> 00:14:07,555
This transmission pattern is fascinating.

246
00:14:07,638 --> 00:14:09,848
-We should get closer.
-We can't.

247
00:14:09,932 --> 00:14:12,851
Thanks to you, this place
is about to be swarming with bots.

248
00:14:12,935 --> 00:14:14,520
We have to retreat.

249
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:17,523
[groans] I should've known better
than to trust you.

250
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:21,235
You don't care about Glimmer or any of us.
You only care about tech.

251
00:14:22,778 --> 00:14:25,155
Are you all mad at me?

252
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:30,035
You're seriously just realizing that?
Yeah, we're mad.

253
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:32,788
You don't consider how your actions
affect other people.

254
00:14:32,913 --> 00:14:34,957
People who are supposed
to be your friends.

255
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:39,086
Like us. The ones who were getting
beat up by your dumb bots.

256
00:14:39,169 --> 00:14:41,839
And whose kingdoms you almost destroyed.

257
00:14:44,425 --> 00:14:48,012
I'm not good at people,
but I am good at tech.

258
00:14:48,095 --> 00:14:53,267
I thought maybe if I could use tech
to help you, you'd like me.

259
00:14:53,851 --> 00:14:55,644
But I messed that up, too.

260
00:14:57,062 --> 00:14:58,606
Entrapta, no!

261
00:15:01,442 --> 00:15:02,735

00:15:04,528 --> 00:15:08,616
I said we have to leave!
Can you listen for once in your life?

264
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:11,035
I'm sorry I'm bad at listening!

265
00:15:11,118 --> 00:15:13,120
I'm sorry I mess everything up!

266
00:15:13,203 --> 00:15:15,956
But you need this signal,
and I'm gonna get it for you.

267
00:15:16,874 --> 00:15:18,626
You're still trying to get the signal?

268
00:15:18,709 --> 00:15:20,294
Of course.

269
00:15:20,377 --> 00:15:21,921
Glimmer needs us.

00:15:27,843 --> 00:15:29,261
[heavy footsteps]

271
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:34,683
Okay, Geek Princess, get that signal.
We'll cover you.

272
00:15:38,395 --> 00:15:40,648
Frosta, Scorpia, on Entrapta!

273
00:15:40,731 --> 00:15:42,691

-Nice job.
-Thanks.

00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:44,628
I wish there was water here for you,
though.

[whirring]

287
00:16:46,755 --> 00:16:48,132
But there is.

288
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:53,095
If there's one thing I know
in the Fright Zone, it's the sewer system.

[gags]

292
00:17:12,614 --> 00:17:14,241
That was so gross!

293
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:15,868
Almost.

294
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:18,579
Got it! Okay, good news and bad news.

295
00:17:18,662 --> 00:17:20,664
The good news,
I've successfully triangulated

296
00:17:20,748 --> 00:17:22,916
-Horde Prime's flagship.
-Hooray!

297
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,711
Bad news,
I intercepted the last message he sent.

298
00:17:25,794 --> 00:17:28,005
He's sending reinforcement ships
to Etheria.

299
00:17:28,088 --> 00:17:30,799
-They'll be here any minute.
-I take back my "hooray."

00:17:48,692 --> 00:17:51,028
Who are you? Are you She-Ra?

303
00:17:55,282 --> 00:17:57,868
She-Ra's gone. The sword is broken.

304
00:17:58,577 --> 00:18:00,120
So, what do I do now?

305
00:18:04,374 --> 00:18:06,168
I'm not sorry I did it.

306
00:18:07,169 --> 00:18:09,088
I just didn't know how much I'd miss her.

307
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:11,215
Not just her strength, but I--

308
00:18:12,132 --> 00:18:14,760
I guess I liked knowing
that I had a destiny.

309
00:18:15,677 --> 00:18:18,472
But it wasn't my destiny
to be She-Ra, was it?

310
00:18:18,555 --> 00:18:19,723
It was random.

311
00:18:19,973 --> 00:18:23,560
Light Hope brought me through the portal
because she needed to use the weapon.

312
00:18:23,644 --> 00:18:25,854
That's the only reason I'm here.

313
00:18:30,484 --> 00:18:32,778
I don't know what my destiny is anymore.

314
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:35,405
But I know my friends need my help.

315
00:18:36,156 --> 00:18:38,158
I guess I'll just figure it out
from there.

316
00:18:40,577 --> 00:18:41,829
Thanks for everything.

00:18:43,997 --> 00:18:44,957

00:18:55,676 --> 00:18:58,762
-Adora!
-Bow, wow, you were right.

319
00:18:59,096 --> 00:19:00,597
I just needed some sleep.

320
00:19:00,722 --> 00:19:02,099
I feel great.

321
00:19:02,683 --> 00:19:05,435
Good. Because I'm on a call
with Mermista and she's saying--

322
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:07,729
<i>-Get to the ship!</i>
<i>-We found her!</i>

323
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:09,022
<i>We found Glimmer!</i>

324
00:19:09,106 --> 00:19:13,026
<i>But also, we found out that Horde Prime</i>
<i>is sending more ships to Etheria today.</i>

325
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:15,863
[Mermista]<i> If you don't leave now,</i>
<i>you can't leave, period.</i>

326
00:19:15,946 --> 00:19:17,698
<i>So, uh... run!</i>

327
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:25,330
We're exposed here.
We need to make these goodbyes quick.

328
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:31,545
We'll be back as soon as we can.

329
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:36,049
The Rebellion is in good hands.

330
00:19:36,633 --> 00:19:40,429
Yeah, it turns out I'm an awesome leader,
so we're gonna be fine.

331
00:19:40,512 --> 00:19:42,139
And Entrapta helped.

332
00:19:42,222 --> 00:19:44,725
You're still a weirdo,
but you did good today.

333
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:46,560
We've got your back any time.

334
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:47,978
-Mm-hm.
-Mm-hm.

00:19:57,821 --> 00:19:59,907
Oh! I don't know how to say this.

338
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:01,533
You're staying here.

339
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:03,702
I don't belong on a ship.

340
00:20:03,952 --> 00:20:06,955
I belong on Etheria, protecting it.

341
00:20:07,164 --> 00:20:08,624
And with you gone,

342
00:20:08,999 --> 00:20:12,085
someone's gotta bring
the glorious flowing hair.

343
00:20:12,294 --> 00:20:14,254
[laughs then sobs]

344
00:20:14,338 --> 00:20:16,548
I hope you're not disappointed in me.

345
00:20:16,632 --> 00:20:19,134
Are you kidding? I'm proud.

346
00:20:19,593 --> 00:20:21,720
You're exactly where you need to be.

347
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:23,430
I'm not She-Ra anymore.

348
00:20:24,014 --> 00:20:26,600
But I'll always be your loyal steed.

[whirring]

350
00:20:31,647 --> 00:20:36,235
Surveillance bots. If they see the ship,
they'll alert the armada and stop us.

351
00:20:36,318 --> 00:20:38,862
What're we gonna do?
Are we gonna have to stay here?

352
00:20:39,613 --> 00:20:40,489
No.

353
00:20:40,572 --> 00:20:43,283
We're getting this ship off Etheria,
no matter what.

354
00:20:43,367 --> 00:20:44,701
I've got an idea.

00:20:59,508 --> 00:21:01,051
You want She-Ra?

358
00:21:01,301 --> 00:21:02,552
Come and get her!

359
00:21:08,016 --> 00:21:09,810
[robotic voices]

360
00:21:13,146 --> 00:21:16,233
What do you think, Micah?
Have we wasted enough of their time?

361
00:21:17,401 --> 00:21:18,860
Get my good side.

362
00:21:23,824 --> 00:21:25,242

[engine roaring]

364
00:21:35,711 --> 00:21:36,670
Whoo!

365
00:21:36,753 --> 00:21:37,713
-Yes!
-Yes!

366
00:21:37,796 --> 00:21:38,839
Go get our girl!

367
00:21:38,922 --> 00:21:40,382
-Go, Adora! Go, go, go!
-Hooray!

368
00:21:40,465 --> 00:21:43,260
-Go save my best friend!
-I reinstate my hooray!

369
00:21:44,928 --> 00:21:45,762
You okay?

370
00:21:46,054 --> 00:21:47,514
I know you wanted to go.

371
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:51,685
But if I hadn't stayed, they wouldn't
have been able to take off at all.

372
00:21:51,768 --> 00:21:53,854
[Micah] <i>I trust my daughter's friends.</i>

373
00:21:53,937 --> 00:21:54,855
<i>They saved me.</i>

374
00:21:55,522 --> 00:21:57,524
<i>Now they'll save her.</i>

375
00:21:57,607 --> 00:21:59,318
See you soon, baby girl.

[whir]

378
00:22:10,829 --> 00:22:13,248
What, come to mock me some more?

379
00:22:13,415 --> 00:22:16,668
You heard Horde Prime.
I'm supposed to be alone.

380
00:22:17,252 --> 00:22:18,420
So, leave me alone.

381
00:22:18,503 --> 00:22:19,713
[crash]

382
00:22:22,883 --> 00:22:23,842
Wait.

383
00:22:25,135 --> 00:22:26,511
I'm sorry. Can--?

384
00:22:27,304 --> 00:22:28,221
Can you stay?

385
00:22:29,056 --> 00:22:30,474
Just for a little.

386
00:22:32,809 --> 00:22:33,643
Okay.
