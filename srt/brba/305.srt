if I may ask?

854
00:42:31,924 --> 00:42:36,929

What was our deal before?

860
00:42:42,101 --> 00:42:44,354
Seventeen percent.

861
00:42:42,101 --> 00:42:44,354
That's a shade high.

862
00:42:44,354 --> 00:42:47,606
Let's settle on an even 15.

863
00:42:44,354 --> 00:42:47,606
That's a nice round number.

864
00:42:47,606 --> 00:42:48,858
