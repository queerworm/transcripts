00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:40,654
I'd leave you in.

582
00:29:42,072 --> 00:29:45,618
Yeah, that's an argument.

583
00:29:45,618 --> 00:29:47,745
Saul,

584
00:29:47,745 --> 00:29:52,082
don't make me beat you

585
00:29:47,745 --> 00:29:52,082
till your legs don't work.

586
00:29:52,082 --> 00:29:56,629
Now tell me where to find him.

587
00:29:52,082 --> 00:29:56,629
You know it's the right thing.

588
00:30:01,007 --> 00:30:03,969
I can't tell you, Mike,

589
00:30:01,007 --> 00:30:03,969
all right? I...

590
00:30:06,012 --> 00:30:07,473
Look, if I was to tell you,

591
00:30:07,473 --> 00:30:11,268
well, I just--

592
00:30:07,473 --> 00:30:11,268
I couldn't live with myself.

593
00:30:11,268 --> 00:30:13,061
I'm sorry.

594
00:30:15,314 --> 00:30:16,690
But who's to say I didn't write

595
00:30:16,690 --> 00:30:19,025
the address down

596
00:30:16,690 --> 00:30:19,025
in my day planner?

597
00:30:19,025 --> 00:30:22,780
Or on a scratch piece of paper

598
00:30:19,025 --> 00:30:22,780
somewhere?

599
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:25,865
Who's to say

600
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:25,865
I didn't write down a location

601
00:30:25,865 --> 00:30:29,369
strictly for

602
00:30:25,865 --> 00:30:29,369
my own professional use?

603
00:30:30,704 --> 00:30:34,667
Do not touch anything

604
00:30:30,704 --> 00:30:34,667
on my desk.

605
00:30:34,667 --> 00:30:38,962
I'm gonna leave the room,

606
00:30:34,667 --> 00:30:38,962
make myself a Nescafé.

607
00:30:55,437 --> 00:30:59,107
SAUL:

608
00:30:55,437 --> 00:30:59,107
I'm just looking out for you,

609
00:30:55,437 --> 00:30:59,107
that's all. Like a mother hen.

610
00:31:00,734 --> 00:31:03,445
Believe me, money-laundering

611
00:31:00,734 --> 00:31:03,445
ain't what it used to be.

612
00:31:03,445 --> 00:31:05,113
God, do I miss the '80s.

613
00:31:05,113 --> 00:31:07,825
You're wasting your time.

614
00:31:05,113 --> 00:31:07,825
I'm buying the car wash,

615
00:31:07,825 --> 00:31:09,660
end of story.

616
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:13,497
Well, one look at this place,

617
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:13,497
you're gonna fall in love, so...

618
00:31:27,511 --> 00:31:29,221
Heh, heh. Huh?

619
00:31:29,221 --> 00:31:30,806
Was I right?

620
00:31:30,806 --> 00:31:33,058
Where else you gonna find

621
00:31:30,806 --> 00:31:33,058
a cash-only business

622
00:31:33,058 --> 00:31:34,476
that's this fun?

623
00:31:34,476 --> 00:31:36,895
Unless we're talking massage

624
00:31:34,476 --> 00:31:36,895
parlors, and, uh,

625
00:31:36,895 --> 00:31:40,524
I don't see it.

626
00:31:36,895 --> 00:31:40,524
Shall we?

627
00:31:46,530 --> 00:31:48,574
SAUL:

628
00:31:46,530 --> 00:31:48,574
You ever actually play

629
00:31:46,530 --> 00:31:48,574
laser tag?

630
00:31:49,949 --> 00:31:51,577
You know, it's good cardio.

631
00:31:51,577 --> 00:31:53,912
Plus, you get to shoot at kids.

632
00:31:51,577 --> 00:31:53,912
Heh.

633
00:32:02,254 --> 00:32:05,298
SAUL:

634
00:32:02,254 --> 00:32:05,298
You got your bumper cars

635
00:32:02,254 --> 00:32:05,298
over there down that way.

636
00:32:05,298 --> 00:32:08,093
Got your arcade here,

637
00:32:05,298 --> 00:32:08,093
all the latest video games.

638
00:32:08,093 --> 00:32:10,470
Snack bar's there.

639
00:32:08,093 --> 00:32:10,470
Nothing stopping you

640
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:12,264
from selling beer

641
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:12,264
to the parents.

642
00:32:12,264 --> 00:32:14,057
That's a whole new

643
00:32:12,264 --> 00:32:14,057
revenue stream--

644
00:32:14,057 --> 00:32:17,561
WALT:

645
00:32:14,057 --> 00:32:17,561
All right, already.

646
00:32:14,057 --> 00:32:17,561
We're good.

647
00:32:18,771 --> 00:32:20,522
Holy Christ.

648
00:32:20,522 --> 00:32:23,776
We're good? This constitutes

649
00:32:20,522 --> 00:32:23,776
good where you're from?

650
00:32:23,776 --> 00:32:26,695
My car is bugged?

651
00:32:23,776 --> 00:32:26,695
I said, maybe. Maybe bugged.

652
00:32:26,695 --> 00:32:30,073
I'm being followed? What the

653
00:32:26,695 --> 00:32:30,073
hell have you gotten me into?

654
00:32:30,073 --> 00:32:33,034
My own PI is threatening

655
00:32:30,073 --> 00:32:33,034
to break my legs.

656
00:32:33,034 --> 00:32:34,745
That's like Thomas Magnum

657
00:32:34,745 --> 00:32:37,539
threatening that little prissy

658
00:32:34,745 --> 00:32:37,539
guy with the mustache.

659
00:32:37,539 --> 00:32:41,126
Over and above. Service-wise,

660
00:32:37,539 --> 00:32:41,126
this is over and above.

661
00:32:41,126 --> 00:32:43,211
You and I survive this,

662
00:32:43,211 --> 00:32:45,923
oh, I'm seriously rethinking

663
00:32:43,211 --> 00:32:45,923
my pricing, yeah.

664
00:32:45,923 --> 00:32:47,633
And that goes double for you,

665
00:32:45,923 --> 00:32:47,633
Hip-Hop.

666
00:32:49,384 --> 00:32:51,344
Okay, my guy's no dummy,

667
00:32:49,384 --> 00:32:51,344
right?

668
00:32:51,344 --> 00:32:53,096
So I give us maybe 24 hours

669
00:32:53,096 --> 00:32:55,808
before he figures out

670
00:32:53,096 --> 00:32:55,808
that address goes nowhere.

671
00:32:55,808 --> 00:32:58,727
You guys do your thing,

672
00:32:55,808 --> 00:32:58,727
make it snappy.

673
00:32:58,727 --> 00:33:02,230
I'll go see if they have

674
00:32:58,727 --> 00:33:02,230
"Tetris" or something.

675
00:33:09,696 --> 00:33:11,907
So how you holding up?

676
00:33:11,907 --> 00:33:13,283
Hm.

677
00:33:14,701 --> 00:33:16,995
You?

678
00:33:16,995 --> 00:33:19,080
I got my old job back.

679
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:22,584
At least until they kill me

680
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:22,584
and Gale takes over.

681
00:33:22,584 --> 00:33:27,297
So he's their boy, huh?

682
00:33:22,584 --> 00:33:27,297
He's their boy.

683
00:33:27,297 --> 00:33:31,092
How long you think

684
00:33:27,297 --> 00:33:31,092
you've got?

685
00:33:31,092 --> 00:33:33,679
Well, he asks a lot of questions

686
00:33:31,092 --> 00:33:33,679
about the cooking process.

687
00:33:35,347 --> 00:33:37,015
I try to be as vague

688
00:33:35,347 --> 00:33:37,015
as possible,

689
00:33:37,015 --> 00:33:38,684
but I got that guy Victor

690
00:33:37,015 --> 00:33:38,684
watching me,

691
00:33:39,726 --> 00:33:42,771
listening to every word I say.

692
00:33:42,771 --> 00:33:45,148
You know, maybe that

693
00:33:42,771 --> 00:33:45,148
the only thing saving me

694
00:33:45,148 --> 00:33:47,985
is Gale's fastidiousness.

695
00:33:47,985 --> 00:33:53,031
And once he feels confident that

696
00:33:47,985 --> 00:33:53,031
he knows my entire method...

697
00:33:58,495 --> 00:34:00,455
So, what do we do?

698
00:34:04,209 --> 00:34:06,461
You know what we do.

699
00:34:14,678 --> 00:34:17,556
There's got to be

700
00:34:14,678 --> 00:34:17,556
some other way.

701
00:34:19,098 --> 00:34:22,978
Maybe it's better for you

702
00:34:19,098 --> 00:34:22,978
to just go to the cops.

703
00:34:22,978 --> 00:34:27,024
All right? I mean, I can't

704
00:34:22,978 --> 00:34:27,024
believe I'm saying that and all,

705
00:34:27,024 --> 00:34:30,527
but for your family.

706
00:34:30,527 --> 00:34:32,738
Hey,

707
00:34:30,527 --> 00:34:32,738
the DEA would love you,

708
00:34:32,738 --> 00:34:34,823
all the shit you could

709
00:34:32,738 --> 00:34:34,823
tell them.

710
00:34:34,823 --> 00:34:38,035
Federal witness protection,

711
00:34:34,823 --> 00:34:38,035
that's a good deal.

712
00:34:38,035 --> 00:34:43,122
As for me, I'll hit the road,

713
00:34:38,035 --> 00:34:43,122
yo. I mean, I'll make it.

714
00:34:44,583 --> 00:34:47,794
We had a good run.

715
00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:51,130
But it's over.

716
00:34:53,717 --> 00:34:56,219
Never the DEA.

717
00:34:58,555 --> 00:35:00,348
The cook can't stop.

718
00:35:00,348 --> 00:35:02,350
That's the one thing

719
00:35:00,348 --> 00:35:02,350
I'm certain of,

720
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:04,937
production cannot stop.

721
00:35:04,937 --> 00:35:07,564
Gus can't afford to.

722
00:35:07,564 --> 00:35:10,859
So if I'm the only chemist

723
00:35:07,564 --> 00:35:10,859
that he's got,

724
00:35:12,444 --> 00:35:15,572
then I've got leverage,

725
00:35:12,444 --> 00:35:15,572
and leverage keeps me alive.

726
00:35:15,572 --> 00:35:19,034
It keeps you alive too.

727
00:35:15,572 --> 00:35:19,034
I think I can see to that.

728
00:35:20,368 --> 00:35:24,831
If I'm the only chemist

729
00:35:20,368 --> 00:35:24,831
that he's got.

730
00:35:32,589 --> 00:35:38,344
I can't do it, Mr. White.

731
00:35:39,721 --> 00:35:41,932
Like you said, I'm...

732
00:35:42,891 --> 00:35:45,018
I'm not a...

733
00:35:46,436 --> 00:35:48,688
I can't do it.

734
00:35:54,277 --> 00:35:56,237
I'll do it.

735
00:35:58,949 --> 00:36:02,452
I'm gonna need your help.

736
00:36:02,452 --> 00:36:04,871
I mean, they're watching me

737
00:36:02,452 --> 00:36:04,871
day and night.

738
00:36:04,871 --> 00:36:07,749
They never leave me alone

739
00:36:04,871 --> 00:36:07,749
with Gale, not for a moment.

740
00:36:07,749 --> 00:36:11,419
Hell, I don't even know

741
00:36:07,749 --> 00:36:11,419
where the man lives.

742
00:36:11,419 --> 00:36:12,754
He's not in the phone book,

743
00:36:12,754 --> 00:36:14,547
I can't find him

744
00:36:12,754 --> 00:36:14,547
on the Internet,

745
00:36:14,547 --> 00:36:18,885
and I can't do it in the lab,

746
00:36:14,547 --> 00:36:18,885
Victor's always there.

747
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:23,181
But if I could just

748
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:26,309
shake Victor,

749
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:26,309
for even an hour one night,

750
00:36:26,309 --> 00:36:29,146
I think then that

751
00:36:29,146 --> 00:36:31,564
I may be able to...

752
00:36:34,359 --> 00:36:36,945
make it look like

753
00:36:34,359 --> 00:36:36,945
an accident.

754
00:36:39,156 --> 00:36:43,368
There's got to be

755
00:36:39,156 --> 00:36:43,368
some other way.

756
00:36:43,368 --> 00:36:45,829
I'm all ears.

757
00:36:45,829 --> 00:36:50,750
But when it comes down to you

758
00:36:45,829 --> 00:36:50,750
and me versus him, I'm sorry.

759
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:54,295
I'm truly sorry,

760
00:36:54,295 --> 00:36:56,255
but it's gonna be him.

761
00:36:57,674 --> 00:37:01,344
Now, you are the only edge

762
00:36:57,674 --> 00:37:01,344
that I've got,

763
00:37:01,344 --> 00:37:03,680
as long as they don't know

764
00:37:01,344 --> 00:37:03,680
that you're in town.

765
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:08,060
But I need you to track him,

766
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:08,060
get me his address.

767
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:10,269
And I'll do the rest.

768
00:37:16,776 --> 00:37:21,114
Look, I saved your life, Jesse.

769
00:37:25,493 --> 00:37:27,954
Are you gonna save mine?
