3
00:00:12,429 --> 00:00:15,390
Yes.

4

Do you see it?

5
00:00:20,354 --> 00:00:25,400
Basically, any lawman worth his

6
00:00:20,354 --> 00:00:25,400
salt is gonna spot that, yeah.

7
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:27,569
Assuming that's a deal breaker?

8
00:00:27,569 --> 00:00:30,155
Yes,

9
00:00:27,569 --> 00:00:30,155
it's a deal breaker.

10
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:37,162
Well, if stealth

11
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:37,162
is what you're aspiring to,

12
00:00:37,162 --> 00:00:42,125
you best go with

13
00:00:37,162 --> 00:00:42,125
something more compact.

14
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:43,669
Thirty-eight Special.

15
00:00:43,669 --> 00:00:45,044
Snub nose.

16
00:00:45,044 --> 00:00:47,006
Got a concealed hammer

17
00:00:47,006 --> 00:00:49,591
so it don't catch on your belt

18
00:00:47,006 --> 00:00:49,591
when you draw.

19
00:00:49,591 --> 00:00:53,428
Tried and true.

20
00:00:49,591 --> 00:00:53,428
No nonsense about it.

21
00:00:55,096 --> 00:00:56,598
Five shots.

22
00:00:55,096 --> 00:00:56,598
Yeah.

23
00:00:56,598 --> 00:00:58,642
Automatic has how many?

24
00:00:58,642 --> 00:01:01,102
Ten in the mag,

25
00:00:58,642 --> 00:01:01,102
one in the chamber.

26
00:01:01,102 --> 00:01:03,104
If you can't get it done

00:01:01,102 --> 00:01:03,104
with five,

28
00:01:03,104 --> 00:01:04,857
you're into spray and pray,

29
00:01:04,857 --> 00:01:09,277

158-grain hollow points

33
00:01:11,906 --> 00:01:13,615
instead of standard wadcutters,

34
00:01:13,615 --> 00:01:15,450
it's got plenty

35
00:01:13,615 --> 00:01:15,450

Try it on with this.

39
00:01:29,423 --> 00:01:34,135
That snubbie will conceal up

40
00:01:29,423 --> 00:01:34,135
real nice if you carry it IWB.

41
00:01:34,135 --> 00:01:37,264
Little harder to draw from,

42
00:01:34,135 --> 00:01:37,264

Yes, absolutely.

847
