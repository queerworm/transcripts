so we're pretty much screwed,

48
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:26,045
because he can just push

578
00:21:39,090 --> 00:21:40,800
<i>on a ride-along</i>

579
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,468
<i>and showed me</i>

580
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,468
<i>just how much money</i>

581
00:21:42,468 --> 00:21:45,387
<i>even a small meth operation</i>

582
00:21:42,468 --> 00:21:45,387
<i>could make.</i>

583
00:21:45,387 --> 00:21:48,307
<i>And I was weak.</i>

584
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:53,104
<i>I didn't want my family</i>

585
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:53,104
<i>to go into financial ruin,</i>

586
00:21:53,104 --> 00:21:54,939
<i>so I agreed.</i>

587
00:21:54,939 --> 00:21:56,690
<i>Hank had a partner,</i>

588
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:59,401
<i>a businessman named</i>

589
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:59,401
<i>Gustavo Fring.</i>

590
00:21:59,401 --> 00:22:02,738
<i>Hank sold me into servitude</i>

591
00:21:59,401 --> 00:22:02,738
<i>to this man,</i>

592
00:22:02,738 --> 00:22:06,450
<i>and when I tried to quit,</i>

593
00:22:02,738 --> 00:22:06,450
<i>Fring threatened my family.</i>

594
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:08,327
<i>I didn't know where to turn.</i>

595
00:22:09,787 --> 00:22:13,666
<i>Eventually, Hank and Fring</i>

596
00:22:09,787 --> 00:22:13,666
<i>had a falling out,</i>

597
00:22:13,666 --> 00:22:15,960
<i>and things escalated.</i>

598
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:19,964
<i>Fring was able to arrange...</i>

599
00:22:19,964 --> 00:22:21,340
<i>Uh, I guess--</i>

600
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:24,051
<i>I guess you call it</i>

601
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:24,051
<i>a hit on Hank.</i>

602
00:22:24,051 --> 00:22:27,013
<i>It failed, but Hank</i>

603
00:22:24,051 --> 00:22:27,013
<i>was seriously injured</i>

604
00:22:27,013 --> 00:22:29,515
<i>and I wound up</i>

605
00:22:27,013 --> 00:22:29,515
<i>paying his medical bills,</i>

606
00:22:29,515 --> 00:22:33,769
<i>which amounted</i>

607
00:22:29,515 --> 00:22:33,769
<i>to a little over $177,000.</i>

608
00:22:33,769 --> 00:22:38,899
<i>Upon recovery,</i>

609
00:22:33,769 --> 00:22:38,899
<i>Hank was bent on revenge.</i>

610
00:22:38,899 --> 00:22:43,321
<i>Working with a man</i>

611
00:22:38,899 --> 00:22:43,321
<i>named Hector Salamanca,</i>

612
00:22:43,321 --> 00:22:45,363
<i>he plotted to kill Fring.</i>

613
00:22:45,363 --> 00:22:50,744
<i>The bomb that he used</i>

614
00:22:45,363 --> 00:22:50,744
<i>was built by me.</i>

615
00:22:50,744 --> 00:22:53,831
<i>He gave me no option in that.</i>

616
00:22:53,831 --> 00:22:57,459
<i>I have often contemplated</i>

617
00:22:53,831 --> 00:22:57,459
<i>suicide,</i>

618
00:22:57,459 --> 00:22:59,879
<i>but I'm a coward.</i>

619
00:23:02,173 --> 00:23:04,633
<i>I wanted to go to the police,</i>

620
00:23:06,052 --> 00:23:07,720
<i>but I was frightened.</i>

621
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:10,639
<i>Hank had risen</i>

622
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:10,639
<i>to become the head</i>

623
00:23:10,639 --> 00:23:12,725
<i>of the Albuquerque DEA.</i>

624
00:23:12,725 --> 00:23:16,062
<i>To keep me in line,</i>

625
00:23:12,725 --> 00:23:16,062
<i>he took my children.</i>

626
00:23:16,062 --> 00:23:18,981
<i>For three months</i>

627
00:23:16,062 --> 00:23:18,981
<i>he kept them.</i>

628
00:23:20,691 --> 00:23:25,529
<i>My wife had no idea</i>

629
00:23:20,691 --> 00:23:25,529
<i>of my criminal activities,</i>

630
00:23:25,529 --> 00:23:28,824
<i>was horrified to learn</i>

631
00:23:25,529 --> 00:23:28,824
<i>what I had done.</i>

632
00:23:31,493 --> 00:23:33,913
<i>I was in hell.</i>

633
00:23:33,913 --> 00:23:38,000
<i>I hated myself for what</i>

634
00:23:33,913 --> 00:23:38,000
<i>I had brought upon my family.</i>

635
00:23:39,793 --> 00:23:43,381
<i>Recently, I tried</i>

636
00:23:39,793 --> 00:23:43,381
<i>once again to quit,</i>

637
00:23:43,381 --> 00:23:47,843
<i>and in response,</i>

638
00:23:43,381 --> 00:23:47,843
<i>he gave me this.</i>

639
00:23:57,103 --> 00:23:59,897
<i>I can't take this anymore.</i>

640
00:23:59,897 --> 00:24:04,902
<i>I live in fear every day</i>

641
00:23:59,897 --> 00:24:04,902
<i>that Hank will kill me,</i>

642
00:24:06,237 --> 00:24:09,198
<i>or worse, hurt my family.</i>

643
00:24:11,951 --> 00:24:16,496
<i>All I could think to do</i>

644
00:24:11,951 --> 00:24:16,496
<i>was to make this video</i>

645
00:24:16,496 --> 00:24:22,920
<i>and hope that the world</i>

646
00:24:16,496 --> 00:24:22,920
<i>will finally see this man</i>

647
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:25,672
<i>for what he really is.</i>

648
00:24:36,058 --> 00:24:38,144
Who do you think

649
00:24:36,058 --> 00:24:38,144
he's shown this to?

650
00:24:39,979 --> 00:24:43,065
No one.

651
00:24:39,979 --> 00:24:43,065
It's a threat.

652
00:24:45,025 --> 00:24:48,570
It's what he will do

653
00:24:45,025 --> 00:24:48,570
if I don't back off.

654
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:50,864
I think you should

655
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:50,864
show this to Ramey.

656
00:24:50,864 --> 00:24:53,075
Just get ahead of it.

657
00:24:53,075 --> 00:24:55,119
That video is

658
00:24:53,075 --> 00:24:55,119
a bunch of lies, Hank.

659
00:24:55,119 --> 00:24:57,121
Anybody who knows you

660
00:24:55,119 --> 00:24:57,121
will know.

661
00:24:57,121 --> 00:25:00,540
A hundred and seventy-seven

662
00:24:57,121 --> 00:25:00,540
thousand dollars?

663
00:25:04,337 --> 00:25:06,588
Hell is he talking about?

664
00:25:10,926 --> 00:25:12,845
Marie?

665
00:25:15,722 --> 00:25:18,684
They told me

666
00:25:15,722 --> 00:25:18,684
it was gambling money.

667
00:25:20,644 --> 00:25:23,105
What was gambling money?

668
00:25:26,359 --> 00:25:29,945
Oh, Jesus Christ, Marie.

669
00:25:29,945 --> 00:25:33,073
Oh, God, no.

670
00:25:29,945 --> 00:25:33,073
How was I supposed to know?

671
00:25:33,073 --> 00:25:34,741
How was I to know

672
00:25:33,073 --> 00:25:34,741
where it came from?

673
00:25:34,741 --> 00:25:37,870
Why were they paying my bills?

674
00:25:34,741 --> 00:25:37,870
What about my insurance?

675
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:40,414
Insurance wouldn't have covered

676
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:40,414
the treatment you needed,

677
00:25:40,414 --> 00:25:43,334
and I... I just wanted

678
00:25:40,414 --> 00:25:43,334
the best for you.

679
00:25:43,334 --> 00:25:44,710
Why didn't you tell me?

680
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:47,171
Because I knew

681
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:47,171
that you would refuse it,

682
00:25:47,171 --> 00:25:49,715
and without it, you may never

683
00:25:47,171 --> 00:25:49,715
have been able to walk again.

684
00:25:49,715 --> 00:25:52,426
Oh, Christ, Marie.

685
00:25:56,472 --> 00:25:58,682
You killed me here.

686
00:25:58,682 --> 00:26:01,559
I mean, it's the--

687
00:25:58,682 --> 00:26:01,559
It's the last nail.

688
00:26:01,559 --> 00:26:04,938
That's the last nail

689
00:26:01,559 --> 00:26:04,938
in the coffin.

690
00:26:07,233 --> 00:26:09,068
What do we do?

691
00:26:30,005 --> 00:26:33,842
If I were you,

692
00:26:30,005 --> 00:26:33,842
I'd be more nervous.

693
00:26:33,842 --> 00:26:36,220
Ugh. Jesus.

694
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:37,930
It's always the desert.

695
00:26:40,724 --> 00:26:42,809
[SIGHS]

696
00:27:36,238 --> 00:27:38,491
Uh, I already checked it.

697
00:27:36,238 --> 00:27:38,491
It's clean.

698
00:27:38,491 --> 00:27:41,827
I wouldn't have driven it here

699
00:27:38,491 --> 00:27:41,827
if it wasn't.

700
00:27:41,827 --> 00:27:44,288
Get one of these,

701
00:27:41,827 --> 00:27:44,288
by the way.

702
00:27:44,288 --> 00:27:47,791
Reads radio signals.

703
00:27:44,288 --> 00:27:47,791
Much easier.

704
00:27:53,964 --> 00:27:55,508
What does he know?

705
00:27:55,508 --> 00:27:57,551
[SIGHS]

706
00:27:57,551 --> 00:28:00,471
I mean, he knows

707
00:27:57,551 --> 00:28:00,471
you're Heisenberg.

708
00:28:00,471 --> 00:28:02,556
But I figure not much else,

709
00:28:02,556 --> 00:28:04,933
otherwise, you know,

710
00:28:02,556 --> 00:28:04,933
you'd be locked up.

711
00:28:07,269 --> 00:28:10,397
What did he say exactly?

712
00:28:10,397 --> 00:28:14,151
He wants me

713
00:28:10,397 --> 00:28:14,151
to inform on you for him.

714
00:28:14,151 --> 00:28:17,029
Tell him everything we did.

715
00:28:18,238 --> 00:28:19,657
Anything else?

716
00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:25,245
I don't think he's told

717
00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:25,245
the rest of the DEA.

718
00:28:25,245 --> 00:28:27,623
Why do you say that?

719
00:28:27,623 --> 00:28:30,584
Just him being there

720
00:28:27,623 --> 00:28:30,584
all by himself,

721
00:28:30,584 --> 00:28:34,296
and, plus, he was acting

722
00:28:30,584 --> 00:28:34,296
kind of shady.

723
00:28:34,296 --> 00:28:37,007
Seemed like he didn't

724
00:28:34,296 --> 00:28:37,007
want the other cops

725
00:28:37,007 --> 00:28:39,801
hearing what he had to say.

726
00:28:37,007 --> 00:28:39,801
Mm.

727
00:28:39,801 --> 00:28:42,012
Are we gonna talk

728
00:28:39,801 --> 00:28:42,012
about the rain of caca

729
00:28:42,012 --> 00:28:43,847
the kid brought down

730
00:28:42,012 --> 00:28:43,847
upon us?

731
00:28:43,847 --> 00:28:46,766
Want to hazard a guess what his

732
00:28:43,847 --> 00:28:46,766
little charity drive cost you?

733
00:28:46,766 --> 00:28:49,478
Why don't you go

734
00:28:46,766 --> 00:28:49,478
take a walk, Saul?

735
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:01,948
Jesse, will you let me

736
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:01,948
help you?

737
00:29:01,948 --> 00:29:06,119
I don't like to see you

738
00:29:01,948 --> 00:29:06,119
hurting like this.

739
00:29:08,872 --> 00:29:11,875
Maybe it's time for a change.

740
00:29:13,835 --> 00:29:15,671
What kind of change?

741
00:29:16,922 --> 00:29:19,633
I don't know.

742
00:29:22,678 --> 00:29:25,222
I don't know, maybe...

743
00:29:26,432 --> 00:29:29,768
Maybe it's time

744
00:29:26,432 --> 00:29:29,768
for you to just...

745
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:33,564
leave all of this behind.

746
00:29:33,564 --> 00:29:35,482
Just get out of town.

747
00:29:35,482 --> 00:29:37,651
Don't look back.

748
00:29:43,407 --> 00:29:45,618
Saul knows a man.

749
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:52,832
He specializes in giving

750
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:52,832
people new identities.

751
00:29:52,832 --> 00:29:56,712
He would move you

752
00:29:52,832 --> 00:29:56,712
someplace far away

753
00:29:56,712 --> 00:29:59,632
and set you up

754
00:29:56,712 --> 00:29:59,632
with a whole new life.

755
00:30:00,924 --> 00:30:06,430
Yeah, I know,

756
00:30:00,924 --> 00:30:06,430
sounds a little extreme.

757
00:30:09,015 --> 00:30:11,935
But maybe it's exactly

758
00:30:09,015 --> 00:30:11,935
what you need.

759
00:30:13,562 --> 00:30:16,523
You know, I really think

760
00:30:13,562 --> 00:30:16,523
that would be good for you.

761
00:30:16,523 --> 00:30:19,401
A clean slate.

762
00:30:19,401 --> 00:30:22,237
All right,

763
00:30:19,401 --> 00:30:22,237
just think about it.

764
00:30:22,237 --> 00:30:23,739
You get a job,

765
00:30:23,739 --> 00:30:27,909
something legitimate,

766
00:30:23,739 --> 00:30:27,909
