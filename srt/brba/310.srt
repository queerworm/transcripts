198
00:12:17,195 --> 00:12:19,364
Like, uh, one fly?

199
00:12:19,364 --> 00:12:21,074
Singular?

200
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,118
What did it do?

201
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,118
It got into the lab.

202
00:12:24,118 --> 00:12:26,496
I'm trying to get it out.

203
00:12:24,118 --> 00:12:26,496
Okay? Understand?

204
00:12:26,496 --> 00:12:28,789
No, man, not really.

205
00:12:28,789 --> 00:12:33,587
I can't say that I'm really

206
00:12:28,789 --> 00:12:33,587
following you here.

207
00:12:33,587 --> 00:12:36,631
Dude, you scared

208
00:12:33,587 --> 00:12:36,631
the shit out of me!

209
00:12:36,631 --> 00:12:38,883
When you say it's

210
00:12:36,631 --> 00:12:38,883
contamination, I mean,

211
00:12:38,883 --> 00:12:41,177
I'm thinking like an Ebola

212
00:12:38,883 --> 00:12:41,177
leak or something.

213
00:12:41,177 --> 00:12:42,803
Ebola.

214
00:12:42,803 --> 00:12:45,223
Yeah, it's a disease

215
00:12:42,803 --> 00:12:45,223
on The Discovery Channel

216
00:12:45,223 --> 00:12:46,600
where all your intestines

217
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,309
sort of just slip out

218
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,309
of your butt.

219
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:49,977
Thank you.

220
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:49,977
I know what Ebola is.

221
00:12:49,977 --> 00:12:51,187
Uh-huh.

222
00:12:49,977 --> 00:12:51,187
Now, tell me.

223
00:12:51,187 --> 00:12:54,274
What would a

224
00:12:51,187 --> 00:12:54,274
West African virus

225
00:12:54,274 --> 00:12:56,484
be doing in our lab?

226
00:12:54,274 --> 00:12:56,484
Hm?

227
00:12:56,484 --> 00:13:00,029
So you're chasing

228
00:12:56,484 --> 00:13:00,029
around a fly,

229
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:03,866
and in your world,

230
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:03,866
I'm the idiot.

231
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:07,203
Jesse, listen.

232
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:08,413
This fly--

233
00:13:08,413 --> 00:13:11,666
No, any fly cannot be

234
00:13:08,413 --> 00:13:11,666
in our lab.

235
00:13:11,666 --> 00:13:14,001
It's a problem.

236
00:13:11,666 --> 00:13:14,001
It's a contamination.

237
00:13:14,001 --> 00:13:17,547
And that is in no way

238
00:13:14,001 --> 00:13:17,547
a misuse of the word. Okay?

239
00:13:17,547 --> 00:13:21,800
So in terms of keeping

240
00:13:17,547 --> 00:13:21,800
our cook clean

241
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,762
and our product

242
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,762
unadulterated,

243
00:13:23,762 --> 00:13:26,347
we need to take this

244
00:13:23,762 --> 00:13:26,347
very seriously.

245
00:13:26,347 --> 00:13:28,266
Now do you understand?

246
00:13:31,352 --> 00:13:33,605
So is that

247
00:13:31,352 --> 00:13:33,605
your fly-saber?

248
00:13:35,774 --> 00:13:37,191
This is a swatter.

249
00:13:37,191 --> 00:13:39,653
And it happens to work

250
00:13:37,191 --> 00:13:39,653
quite well, thank you.

251
00:13:39,653 --> 00:13:41,070
Uh-huh. Hey,

252
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:43,782
what happened

253
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:43,782
to your head?

254
00:13:43,782 --> 00:13:45,408
Nothing. I'm fine.

255
00:13:45,408 --> 00:13:48,620
You didn't hit it,

256
00:13:45,408 --> 00:13:48,620
like really, really hard?

257
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:50,747
My head is not

258
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:50,747
the problem, Jesse.

259
00:13:50,747 --> 00:13:54,375
The fly is the problem.

260
00:13:54,375 --> 00:14:00,839
You didn't happen to maybe

261
00:13:54,375 --> 00:14:00,839
try our product, did you?

262
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:04,678
Jesse, I know this seems

263
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:04,678
unusual to you, a layman.

264
00:14:04,678 --> 00:14:08,515
A fly. I get it.

265
00:14:04,678 --> 00:14:08,515
It seems insignificant, right?

266
00:14:08,515 --> 00:14:10,016
But trust me,

267
00:14:10,016 --> 00:14:12,851
in a highly controlled

268
00:14:10,016 --> 00:14:12,851
environment such as this...

269
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:17,774
any pollutant...

270
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,778
no matter how small...

271
00:14:25,239 --> 00:14:27,659
could completely...

272
00:14:41,464 --> 00:14:42,799
Hello?

273
00:14:45,218 --> 00:14:46,678
What?

274
00:14:49,806 --> 00:14:53,017
Were you here all night?

275
00:14:53,017 --> 00:14:54,769
Have you even slept?

276
00:14:54,769 --> 00:14:57,480
No. Jesse, look.

277
00:14:54,769 --> 00:14:57,480
I'm fine, okay?

278
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,940
Will you just please

279
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,940
focus on--?

280
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:03,444
[BEEPING]

281
00:15:03,444 --> 00:15:04,654
[BEEPING STOPS]

282
00:15:04,654 --> 00:15:06,406
Okay, look,

283
00:15:04,654 --> 00:15:06,406
we're running late,

284
00:15:06,406 --> 00:15:07,907
so let's just get started.

285
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:10,326
The sooner we do it,

286
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:10,326
the sooner we're done.

287
00:15:10,326 --> 00:15:13,120
Fricking finally.

288
00:15:16,165 --> 00:15:18,042
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

289
00:15:18,042 --> 00:15:19,669
What are you doing?

290
00:15:19,669 --> 00:15:21,880
It's time to alkaline.

291
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:25,174
Have you not heard

292
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:25,174
a word I said?

293
00:15:25,174 --> 00:15:28,595
No cooking until this fly

294
00:15:25,174 --> 00:15:28,595
is dealt with.

295
00:15:28,595 --> 00:15:31,180
Have I been

296
00:15:28,595 --> 00:15:31,180
speaking to myself?

297
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:33,224
The timer went off, yo.

298
00:15:33,224 --> 00:15:35,309
How long is this batch

299
00:15:33,224 --> 00:15:35,309
gonna be good for?

300
00:15:35,309 --> 00:15:36,853
An hour? Two?

301
00:15:36,853 --> 00:15:38,813
The batch will be

302
00:15:36,853 --> 00:15:38,813
good for nothing

303
00:15:38,813 --> 00:15:40,899
if we don't clear

304
00:15:38,813 --> 00:15:40,899
the contaminant.

305
00:15:40,899 --> 00:15:43,109
"Clear the

306
00:15:40,899 --> 00:15:43,109
contaminant."

307
00:15:43,109 --> 00:15:45,820
We're making meth here,

308
00:15:43,109 --> 00:15:45,820
all right? Not space shuttles.

309
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:49,741
We're making nothing

310
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:49,741
until we catch this fly.

311
00:15:49,741 --> 00:15:51,367
What fly? All right?

312
00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:54,829
Where the hell is this fly?

313
00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:54,829
Not like I even seen the thing.

314
00:15:54,829 --> 00:15:56,456
Maybe your

315
00:15:54,829 --> 00:15:56,456
positive pressure

316
00:15:56,456 --> 00:15:58,374
blew it out the door

317
00:15:56,456 --> 00:15:58,374
or something.

318
00:15:58,374 --> 00:16:01,419
No, no, it is here.

319
00:15:58,374 --> 00:16:01,419
It is around, okay?

320
00:16:01,419 --> 00:16:02,879
He's around,

321
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:05,298
and I am not going

322
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:05,298
to expose this batch

323
00:16:05,298 --> 00:16:07,717
to the open air

324
00:16:05,298 --> 00:16:07,717
and contamination, period.

325
00:16:07,717 --> 00:16:10,094
Now, you can leave me

326
00:16:07,717 --> 00:16:10,094
to deal with this myself

327
00:16:10,094 --> 00:16:11,930
or you can help me.

328
00:16:10,094 --> 00:16:11,930
But you are right.

329
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:13,681
We are running

330
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:13,681
out of time.

331
00:16:13,681 --> 00:16:17,184
So I need your answer

332
00:16:13,681 --> 00:16:17,184
right now.

333
00:16:23,357 --> 00:16:24,984
Okay.

334
00:16:34,494 --> 00:16:38,873
Hey, tick-tock, yo.

335
00:16:45,463 --> 00:16:47,340
Look, I like making

336
00:16:45,463 --> 00:16:47,340
cherry product,

337
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:49,216
but let's keep it real,

338
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:49,216
all right?

339
00:16:49,216 --> 00:16:53,095
We make poison for

340
00:16:49,216 --> 00:16:53,095
people who don't care.

341
00:16:53,095 --> 00:16:54,681
We probably have

342
00:16:53,095 --> 00:16:54,681
the most

343
00:16:54,681 --> 00:16:56,683
un-picky customers

344
00:16:54,681 --> 00:16:56,683
in the world.

345
00:16:56,683 --> 00:16:59,268
No, no, no.

346
00:16:56,683 --> 00:16:59,268
No rationalizing.

347
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:02,522
We'll find it any minute.

348
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:02,522
Don't give up.

349
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:20,289
Did you know that there's

350
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:20,289
an acceptable level of rat turds

351
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:24,168
that can go into candy bars?

352
00:17:24,168 --> 00:17:27,129
That's the government,

353
00:17:24,168 --> 00:17:27,129
Jack.

354
00:17:27,129 --> 00:17:29,549
Even the government

355
00:17:29,549 --> 00:17:34,345
doesn't care that

356
00:17:29,549 --> 00:17:34,345
much about quality.

357
00:17:34,345 --> 00:17:41,143
You know what is okay

358
00:17:34,345 --> 00:17:41,143
to put in hotdogs, huh?

359
00:17:41,143 --> 00:17:44,146
Pig lips and assholes.

360
00:17:44,146 --> 00:17:47,984
But I say, hey,

361
00:17:44,146 --> 00:17:47,984
have at it, bitches,

362
00:17:47,984 --> 00:17:50,653
because I love hotdogs.

363
00:17:50,653 --> 00:17:53,322
And, you know,

364
00:17:50,653 --> 00:17:53,322
see what I'm try--?

365
00:17:53,322 --> 00:17:54,908
What are you doing?

366
00:17:54,908 --> 00:17:57,785
Oh, hey.

367
00:17:59,245 --> 00:18:01,873
Look, let me just top it off,

368
00:17:59,245 --> 00:18:01,873
all right, really quick.

369
00:18:01,873 --> 00:18:04,667
You know,

370
00:18:01,873 --> 00:18:04,667
a little sodium hydroxide,

371
00:18:04,667 --> 00:18:07,670
shut the lid. No harm done.

372
00:18:04,667 --> 00:18:07,670
Then we're golden.

373
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:15,011
It stays closed.

374
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:15,011
That's an order.

375
00:18:15,011 --> 00:18:18,347
You can't order shit,

376
00:18:15,011 --> 00:18:18,347
Adolf, all right?

377
00:18:18,347 --> 00:18:21,601
We're 50-50

378
00:18:18,347 --> 00:18:21,601
partners, remember?

379
00:18:26,022 --> 00:18:27,899
Ow!

380
00:18:27,899 --> 00:18:29,901
God, what is your problem?

381
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:35,949
Freaking psycho. Oh!

382
00:18:35,949 --> 00:18:38,242
Jesse.

383
00:18:35,949 --> 00:18:38,242
Oh, God.

384
00:18:38,242 --> 00:18:41,370
It, like, hit bone.

385
00:18:38,242 --> 00:18:41,370
Jesse.

386
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:42,997
Jesse.

387
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:49,295
You see it, right?

388
00:18:49,295 --> 00:18:51,089
You see it?

389
00:18:51,089 --> 00:18:52,757
Yeah.

390
00:18:55,217 --> 00:18:57,095
Get it.

391

00:27:05,458 --> 00:27:07,834
not looking right

586
00:27:05,458 --> 00:27:07,834
at it, right?

587
00:27:07,834 --> 00:27:10,921
I mean, it thinks

588
00:27:07,834 --> 00:27:10,921
it's fooling you.

589
00:27:10,921 --> 00:27:12,214
That's what

590
00:27:10,921 --> 00:27:12,214
they do.

591
00:27:12,214 --> 00:27:14,632
I mean, they play

592
00:27:12,214 --> 00:27:14,632
dead or whatever.

593
00:27:14,632 --> 00:27:17,386
It's just so lame.

594
00:27:17,386 --> 00:27:22,475
Is there a discernible

595
00:27:17,386 --> 00:27:22,475
point to this story?

596
00:27:22,475 --> 00:27:25,561
A point that

597
00:27:22,475 --> 00:27:25,561
you'll be arriving at

598
00:27:25,561 --> 00:27:28,564
sometime in

599
00:27:25,561 --> 00:27:28,564
the near future?

600
00:27:28,564 --> 00:27:30,774
It was just a total

601
00:27:28,564 --> 00:27:30,774
bitch to get out.

602
00:27:30,774 --> 00:27:32,485
You know,

603
00:27:30,774 --> 00:27:32,485
it took forever.

604
00:27:32,485 --> 00:27:39,199
Guy came, set all these traps

605
00:27:32,485 --> 00:27:39,199
and all and he finally got it.

606
00:27:39,199 --> 00:27:44,830
But my aunt, you know,

607
00:27:39,199 --> 00:27:44,830
she didn't believe it.

608
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:49,376
I mean, she kept insisting

609
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:49,376
she could still hear the thing.

610
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:52,421
I mean, you could not

611
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:52,421
tell her any different.

612
00:27:52,421 --> 00:27:54,756
She started keeping

613
00:27:52,421 --> 00:27:54,756
an old umbrella,

614
00:27:54,756 --> 00:27:56,842
you know,

615
00:27:54,756 --> 00:27:56,842
by her chair.

616
00:27:56,842 --> 00:28:00,053
Man, she would just bang

617
00:27:56,842 --> 00:28:00,053
on the floor and yell at it.

618
00:28:00,053 --> 00:28:02,598
Even gave it a name.

619
00:28:02,598 --> 00:28:06,393
It was Scrabble.

620
00:28:06,393 --> 00:28:07,727
Yeah, that was it.

621
00:28:07,727 --> 00:28:10,022
You know, "Scrabble,

622
00:28:07,727 --> 00:28:10,022
just knock it off."

623
00:28:10,022 --> 00:28:11,857
Bang, bang, bang.

624
00:28:14,234 --> 00:28:18,364
She got like that

625
00:28:14,234 --> 00:28:18,364
toward the end.

626
00:28:19,865 --> 00:28:26,163
Got obsessive about stuff.

627
00:28:19,865 --> 00:28:26,163
Just got mad about stuff.

628
00:28:26,163 --> 00:28:29,041
We didn't know

629
00:28:26,163 --> 00:28:29,041
what was up.

630
00:28:29,041 --> 00:28:33,504
It wasn't like her

631
00:28:29,041 --> 00:28:33,504
to be that way.

632
00:28:36,298 --> 00:28:41,220
But it turned out

633
00:28:36,298 --> 00:28:41,220
that the cancer

634
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:45,474
had spread to her brain

635
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:45,474
and that was why.

636
00:28:45,474 --> 00:28:49,353
It, um, metastasized.

637
00:28:50,979 --> 00:28:54,233
But it was good that

638
00:28:50,979 --> 00:28:54,233
that was when we decided

639
00:28:54,233 --> 00:28:57,152
to take her to the doctor,

640
00:28:57,152 --> 00:29:00,322
because then we knew

641
00:28:57,152 --> 00:29:00,322
what was up.

642
00:29:00,322 --> 00:29:03,116
You know,

643
00:29:00,322 --> 00:29:03,116
got her some treatment.

644
00:29:03,116 --> 00:29:06,704
Meds, so she wasn't

645
00:29:03,116 --> 00:29:06,704
stressing all the time.

646
00:29:10,457 --> 00:29:14,503
It was a lot better after that.

647
00:29:14,503 --> 00:29:18,131
You know, she was a lot happier.

648
00:29:25,805 --> 00:29:27,933
Where the hell is he?

649
00:29:36,525 --> 00:29:40,070
I've been to my

650
00:29:36,525 --> 00:29:40,070
oncologist, Jesse,

651
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:41,947
just last week.

652
00:29:44,074 --> 00:29:46,660
I'm still in remission.

653
00:29:47,661 --> 00:29:49,496
I'm healthy.

654
00:29:49,496 --> 00:29:54,501
Okay, so good.

655
00:29:49,496 --> 00:29:54,501
Great.

656
00:29:56,378 --> 00:29:57,671
Well...

657
00:29:58,756 --> 00:30:01,841
no end in sight.

658
00:30:01,841 --> 00:30:04,303
That's great.

659
00:30:06,388 --> 00:30:08,807
Well...

660
00:30:08,807 --> 00:30:10,850
I missed it.

661
00:30:16,022 --> 00:30:23,280
There was some perfect moment

662
00:30:16,022 --> 00:30:23,280
and it passed me right by.

663
00:30:24,906 --> 00:30:29,911
I had to have enough

664
00:30:24,906 --> 00:30:29,911
to leave them.

665
00:30:29,911 --> 00:30:33,039
That was the whole point.

666
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:35,917
I mean, none of this--

667
00:30:35,917 --> 00:30:40,631
None of this makes any sense

668
00:30:35,917 --> 00:30:40,631
if I didn't have enough.

669
00:30:41,965 --> 00:30:46,637
But it had to be

670
00:30:41,965 --> 00:30:46,637
before she found out. Skyler.

671
00:30:46,637 --> 00:30:49,306
It had to be before that.

672
00:30:49,306 --> 00:30:53,977
Perfect moment for what?

673
00:30:55,187 --> 00:30:57,439
To drop dead?

674
00:30:57,439 --> 00:31:00,776
What, you saying

675
00:30:57,439 --> 00:31:00,776
you wanna die?

676
00:31:03,195 --> 00:31:07,991
I'm saying

677
00:31:03,195 --> 00:31:07,991
I've lived too long.

678
00:31:09,702 --> 00:31:11,161
I mean,

679
00:31:11,161 --> 00:31:16,500
you want them to actually

680
00:31:11,161 --> 00:31:16,500
miss you, you know?

681
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:21,129
You want their memories

682
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:21,129
of you to be...

683
00:31:23,799 --> 00:31:26,009
But she just won't--

684
00:31:26,009 --> 00:31:29,095
She just won't understand.

685
00:31:29,095 --> 00:31:33,933
I mean, no matter how well

686
00:31:29,095 --> 00:31:33,933
I explain it,

687
00:31:33,933 --> 00:31:37,229
these days,

688
00:31:33,933 --> 00:31:37,229
she just has this--

689
00:31:37,229 --> 00:31:38,897
This--

690
00:31:40,691 --> 00:31:43,819
I mean, I truly

691
00:31:40,691 --> 00:31:43,819
believe there exists

692
00:31:43,819 --> 00:31:46,196
some combination

693
00:31:43,819 --> 00:31:46,196
of words.

694
00:31:46,196 --> 00:31:52,077
There must exist certain words

695
00:31:46,196 --> 00:31:52,077
in a certain specific order

696
00:31:52,077 --> 00:31:53,995
that would explain

697
00:31:52,077 --> 00:31:53,995
all of this,

698
00:31:53,995 --> 00:31:57,624
but with her, I just--

699
00:31:57,624 --> 00:32:00,627
I just can't ever

700
00:31:57,624 --> 00:32:00,627
seem to find them.

701
00:32:00,627 --> 00:32:03,004
Mr. White, how about

702
00:32:00,627 --> 00:32:03,004
you just sit down?

703
00:32:03,004 --> 00:32:06,049
You know, I was thinking maybe

704
00:32:03,004 --> 00:32:06,049
before the fugue state,

705
00:32:06,049 --> 00:32:09,678
but before the fugue state,

706
00:32:06,049 --> 00:32:09,678
I didn't have enough money.

707
00:32:09,678 --> 00:32:13,223
So no, not then.

708
00:32:21,064 --> 00:32:26,069
And plus, my daughter

709
00:32:21,064 --> 00:32:26,069
wasn't born yet.

710
00:32:26,069 --> 00:32:28,988
It had to be after

711
00:32:26,069 --> 00:32:28,988
Holly was born.

712
00:32:28,988 --> 00:32:30,699
Mr. White--

713
00:32:30,699 --> 00:32:33,660
Definitely

714
00:32:30,699 --> 00:32:33,660
before the surgery.

715
00:32:35,287 --> 00:32:37,915
Oh, Christ.

716
00:32:37,915 --> 00:32:40,083
That damn second cell phone.

717
00:32:40,083 --> 00:32:42,836
I mean, how could

718
00:32:40,083 --> 00:32:42,836
I possibly...?

719
00:32:53,138 --> 00:32:55,766
Ah, I know the moment.

720
00:32:59,770 --> 00:33:02,731
It was the night Jane died.

721
00:33:07,903 --> 00:33:10,155
Yeah, I--

722
00:33:11,406 --> 00:33:16,453
I was at home and

723
00:33:11,406 --> 00:33:16,453
we needed diapers,

724
00:33:16,453 --> 00:33:21,374
and so I said I'd go,

725
00:33:16,453 --> 00:33:21,374
but it was just an excuse.

726
00:33:21,374 --> 00:33:23,376
Actually,

727
00:33:21,374 --> 00:33:23,376
that was the night

728
00:33:23,376 --> 00:33:26,004
I brought you your

729
00:33:23,376 --> 00:33:26,004
money, remember?

730
00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:29,508
Yeah, I remember.

731
00:33:29,508 --> 00:33:33,804
But afterward,

732
00:33:29,508 --> 00:33:33,804
I stopped at a bar.

733
00:33:33,804 --> 00:33:36,598
It was odd.

734
00:33:33,804 --> 00:33:36,598
I never do that,

735
00:33:36,598 --> 00:33:38,892
go to a bar alone.

736
00:33:38,892 --> 00:33:42,688
I just walked in,

737
00:33:38,892 --> 00:33:42,688
sat down.

738
00:33:46,984 --> 00:33:49,778
I never told you.

739
00:33:49,778 --> 00:33:52,030
That you went to a bar?

740
00:33:53,239 --> 00:33:54,700
No, I...

741
00:33:56,576 --> 00:34:01,874
I sit down and this man,

742
00:33:56,576 --> 00:34:01,874
this stranger,

743
00:34:01,874 --> 00:34:04,417
he engages me

744
00:34:01,874 --> 00:34:04,417
in conversation.

745
00:34:04,417 --> 00:34:06,586
He's a complete stranger.

746
00:34:08,213 --> 00:34:10,632
But he turns out to be

747
00:34:10,632 --> 00:34:15,261
Jane's father,

748
00:34:10,632 --> 00:34:15,261
Donald Margolis.

749
00:34:15,261 --> 00:34:17,263
What are you

750
00:34:15,261 --> 00:34:17,263
talking about?

751
00:34:17,263 --> 00:34:19,265
Of course, I didn't

752
00:34:17,263 --> 00:34:19,265
know it at the time.

753
00:34:19,265 --> 00:34:23,186
I mean, he was just

754
00:34:19,265 --> 00:34:23,186
some guy in a bar.

755
00:34:23,186 --> 00:34:25,856
I didn't put it together

756
00:34:23,186 --> 00:34:25,856
until after the crash

757
00:34:25,856 --> 00:34:27,607
when he was

758
00:34:25,856 --> 00:34:27,607
all over the news.

759
00:34:27,607 --> 00:34:29,735
Jane's dad.

760
00:34:29,735 --> 00:34:33,530
I mean,

761
00:34:29,735 --> 00:34:33,530
think of the odds.

762
00:34:33,530 --> 00:34:35,532
Once I tried

763
00:34:33,530 --> 00:34:35,532
to calculate them,

764
00:34:35,532 --> 00:34:37,617
but they're astronomical.

765
00:34:37,617 --> 00:34:42,539
I mean, think of the odds

766
00:34:37,617 --> 00:34:42,539
of me going in, sitting down,

767
00:34:42,539 --> 00:34:46,793
that night in that bar

768
00:34:42,539 --> 00:34:46,793
next to that man.

769
00:34:49,421 --> 00:34:51,464
What did you talk about?

770
00:34:54,259 --> 00:34:56,261
Oh...

771
00:34:56,261 --> 00:34:58,680
Water on Mars.

772
00:35:01,892 --> 00:35:03,769
Family.

773
00:35:05,645 --> 00:35:08,857
What about family?

774
00:35:11,276 --> 00:35:14,446
I told him that

775
00:35:11,276 --> 00:35:14,446
I had a daughter

776
00:35:14,446 --> 00:35:17,407
and he told me

777
00:35:14,446 --> 00:35:17,407
he had one too.

778
00:35:17,407 --> 00:35:19,451
Then he said,
