00:07:17,145 --> 00:07:19,564

00:08:07,362 --> 00:08:08,822

184
00:08:21,376 --> 00:08:23,586
still a factor.

185
00:08:27,924 --> 00:08:30,469
Yeah.

186
00:08:27,924 --> 00:08:30,469
That's what I thought.

187
00:08:33,554 --> 00:08:36,724
What do you want, exactly?

188
00:08:36,724 --> 00:08:40,228
Because if you don't want

189
00:08:36,724 --> 00:08:40,228
to give me that list,

190
00:08:40,228 --> 00:08:42,563

200
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:56,370
marketplace.

201
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:59,122
What do you know

202
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:59,122
about the Czech Republic?

203
00:09:00,499 --> 00:09:02,167
The Czech Republic?

204
00:09:02,167 --> 00:09:04,044
Did you know

205
00:09:02,167 --> 00:09:04,044
there's a higher

206
00:09:02,167 --> 00:09:04,044
demand for meth there

207
00:09:04,044 --> 00:09:05,962
than anywhere else

208
00:09:04,044 --> 00:09:05,962
in Europe?

209
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:08,340
Five percent

210
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:08,340
of its 10 million people,

211
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:10,591
which is roughly

212
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:10,591
the population

213
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:10,591
of the southwest

214
00:09:10,591 --> 00:09:13,136
from Western Texas

215
00:09:10,591 --> 00:09:13,136
to Phoenix,

216
00:09:13,136 --> 00:09:14,637
are using meth.

217
00:09:14,637 --> 00:09:16,348
You keep

218
00:09:14,637 --> 00:09:16,348
your market here,

219
00:09:16,348 --> 00:09:18,308
but by adding

220
00:09:16,348 --> 00:09:18,308
overseas sales,

221
00:09:18,308 --> 00:09:20,394
you can more than double

222
00:09:18,308 --> 00:09:20,394
your current profits.

223
00:09:20,394 --> 00:09:22,020
And I checked.

224
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:24,398
The average purity

225
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:24,398
is only about 60 percent.

226
00:09:24,398 --> 00:09:27,859
They've never seen

227
00:09:24,398 --> 00:09:27,859
anything like your product.

228
00:09:27,859 --> 00:09:30,820
You'll blow

229
00:09:27,859 --> 00:09:30,820
their hair back.

230
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:34,782
Shipping internationally

231
00:09:34,782 --> 00:09:36,159
seems like

232
00:09:34,782 --> 00:09:36,159
courting disaster.

233
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:37,911
Not if you're madrigal.

234
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:37,911
Madrigal

235
00:09:37,911 --> 00:09:41,540
is under investigation

236
00:09:37,911 --> 00:09:41,540
by the DEA.

237
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:43,542
The restaurant division,

238
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:43,542
mostly.

239
00:09:43,542 --> 00:09:45,293
We've got

240
00:09:43,542 --> 00:09:45,293
46,000 employees

241
00:09:45,293 --> 00:09:47,962
spread across

242
00:09:45,293 --> 00:09:47,962
14 divisions.

243
00:09:47,962 --> 00:09:51,049
And once Mike's people

244
00:09:47,962 --> 00:09:51,049
are no longer a factor,

245
00:09:51,049 --> 00:09:52,426
things should

246
00:09:51,049 --> 00:09:52,426
tidy up nicely.

247
00:09:52,426 --> 00:09:54,302
This is what I do,

248
00:09:52,426 --> 00:09:54,302
you understand?

249
00:09:54,302 --> 00:09:56,721
I move things

250
00:09:54,302 --> 00:09:56,721
from point A to point B

251
00:09:54,302 --> 00:09:56,721
all over the globe.

252
00:09:56,721 --> 00:09:59,474
1.2 million metric tons

253
00:09:56,721 --> 00:09:59,474
a month,

254
00:09:59,474 --> 00:10:02,561
and all of it

255
00:09:59,474 --> 00:10:02,561
right at my fingertips,

256
00:10:02,561 --> 00:10:04,645
a laptop click away.

257
00:10:05,897 --> 00:10:07,732
The Czech Republic...

258
00:10:08,816 --> 00:10:10,235
Who's there

259
00:10:08,816 --> 00:10:10,235
on the other end?

260
00:10:10,235 --> 00:10:11,652
People I ship to regularly.

261
00:10:11,652 --> 00:10:13,363
People I've worked

262
00:10:11,652 --> 00:10:13,363
with for years.

263
00:10:13,363 --> 00:10:14,655
They're professional

264
00:10:13,363 --> 00:10:14,655
and very amenable.

265
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:16,699
I'm very careful

266
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:16,699
who I work with.

267
00:10:23,957 --> 00:10:26,418
And if this is

268
00:10:23,957 --> 00:10:26,418
such a slam dunk,

269
00:10:26,418 --> 00:10:28,503
then why didn't you

270
00:10:26,418 --> 00:10:28,503
pitch it to Fring?

271
00:10:28,503 --> 00:10:29,963
I did.

272
00:10:28,503 --> 00:10:29,963
He said yes.

273
00:10:29,963 --> 00:10:32,673
We were in the final stages

274
00:10:29,963 --> 00:10:32,673
of working it out

275
00:10:32,673 --> 00:10:34,301
when somebody killed him.

276
00:10:39,013 --> 00:10:41,224
You don't think Gus Fring

277
00:10:41,224 --> 00:10:44,769
built his

278
00:10:41,224 --> 00:10:44,769
distribution network

279
00:10:41,224 --> 00:10:44,769
all by himself?

280
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:46,938
There are

281
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:46,938
considerable advantages

282
00:10:46,938 --> 00:10:49,483
to diversification

283
00:10:46,938 --> 00:10:49,483
of distribution,

284
00:10:49,483 --> 00:10:52,026
like putting

285
00:10:49,483 --> 00:10:52,026
6,000 miles

286
00:10:52,026 --> 00:10:54,070
between you

287
00:10:52,026 --> 00:10:54,070
and your product.

288
00:10:56,739 --> 00:10:58,533
At 25 pounds a week,

289
00:10:58,533 --> 00:11:00,868
I'm estimating you'll gross

290
00:10:58,533 --> 00:11:00,868
about two million.

291
00:11:02,579 --> 00:11:05,248
Give me ten pounds to start,

292
00:11:02,579 --> 00:11:05,248
and we'll see how it goes.

293
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:10,711
All right.

294
00:11:10,711 --> 00:11:12,130
Now, with Fring,

295
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:13,714
my end was gonna

296
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:13,714
be 30 percent,

297
00:11:13,714 --> 00:11:16,759
which I believe

298
00:11:13,714 --> 00:11:16,759
is more than fair.

299
00:11:13,714 --> 00:11:16,759
Okay.

300
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:18,886
Trust me,

301
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:18,886
if you do this...

302
00:11:18,886 --> 00:11:21,181
Lydia,

303
00:11:18,886 --> 00:11:21,181
learn to take yes

304
00:11:18,886 --> 00:11:21,181
for an answer.

305
00:11:23,183 --> 00:11:25,726
Now, first things first.

306
00:12:00,094 --> 00:12:01,638
Shake on it?

307
00:12:05,517 --> 00:12:08,061
We're going to make

308
00:12:05,517 --> 00:12:08,061
a lot of money together.

00:13:36,107 --> 00:13:40,654
Todd, I think it's time

313
00:13:36,107 --> 00:13:40,654
I meet your uncle.

314
00:13:40,654 --> 00:13:43,072

315
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:45,450
There's too

316
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:45,450
many muscle-heads

317
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:45,450
flexing their shit.

318
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:46,785
Too many eyes.

319
00:13:46,785 --> 00:13:49,454
MAN 2: Okay,

320
00:13:46,785 --> 00:13:49,454
so no chow line, no yard.

321
00:13:50,747 --> 00:13:52,624
Gonna keep it simple.

322
00:13:52,624 --> 00:13:53,874
Pass-byes.

323
00:13:53,874 --> 00:13:57,295
Yeah. Hallways,

327
00:13:59,005 --> 00:14:01,132
we go with a riot.

328
00:14:01,132 --> 00:14:02,467
Our boys get it done

329
00:14:01,132 --> 00:14:02,467
in a riot.

330
00:14:02,467 --> 00:14:04,969
No, no, no.

331
00:14:02,467 --> 00:14:04,969
No chaos.

332
00:14:04,969 --> 00:14:08,807
I don't want

333
00:14:04,969 --> 00:14:08,807
the goon squad rolling in

334
00:14:04,969 --> 00:14:08,807
and stealing our shot,

335
00:14:08,807 --> 00:14:10,891
you know?

336
00:14:10,891 --> 00:14:13,812
This has gotta be

337
00:14:10,891 --> 00:14:13,812
fast and quiet.

338
00:14:13,812 --> 00:14:15,980
Just boom, boom, boom.

339
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:18,191
You know

340
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:18,191
what I'm saying?

341
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:18,191
Yeah.

Surgical.

344
00:14:20,485 --> 00:14:23,279
That's what it's gotta be.

345
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:28,075
So how many guys

346
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:28,075
we got at MDC?

347
00:14:28,075 --> 00:14:31,579
Three,

348
00:14:28,075 --> 00:14:31,579
counting Shaddock.

349
00:14:31,579 --> 00:14:33,122
And he makes

350
00:14:31,579 --> 00:14:33,122
the schedule now,

351
00:14:33,122 --> 00:14:36,125
so we can put who we need

352
00:14:33,122 --> 00:14:36,125
where we need them.

353
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:39,003
All right.

354
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:39,003
So MDC's covered.

355
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:39,003
What about the rest?

356
00:14:39,003 --> 00:14:41,130
We need G block

357
00:14:39,003 --> 00:14:41,130
in Valencia, right?

358
00:14:42,382 --> 00:14:43,800
Our guy's

359
00:14:42,382 --> 00:14:43,800
on the night shift.

360
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,510
Have him pull a double.

361
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,510
Nah.

362
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:48,137
His supervisor's got

363
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:48,137
some hard-on about OT.

364
00:14:48,137 --> 00:14:51,015
Have him switch with somebody.

365
00:14:48,137 --> 00:14:51,015
I don't know.

366
00:14:48,137 --> 00:14:51,015
Just get it done.

367
00:14:51,015 --> 00:14:53,893
Regardless, you know,

368
00:14:51,015 --> 00:14:53,893
we got enough guys

369
00:14:51,015 --> 00:14:53,893
in Valencia right now?

370
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:55,729
Might have to hire out.

371
00:14:55,729 --> 00:14:57,980
You high?

00:14:55,729 --> 00:14:57,980
Mix blood with<i> chuntaros?</i>

373
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:00,107
No way.

374
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:00,107
Well...

375
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:05,864
There's no need.

376
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:05,864
We got enough.

377
00:15:05,864 --> 00:15:07,907
Hitters ain't the problem.

378
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:10,451
It's that short

379
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:10,451
walking window after lunch.

380
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:10,451
Mmm-hmm.

381
00:15:10,451 --> 00:15:11,661
Yeah.

382
00:15:11,661 --> 00:15:13,872
It's gonna be tight.

383
00:15:13,872 --> 00:15:15,665
Real tight.

384
00:15:21,003 --> 00:15:22,881
You know,

385
00:15:21,003 --> 00:15:22,881
I gotta be straight

386
00:15:21,003 --> 00:15:22,881
with you, man.

387
00:15:22,881 --> 00:15:26,593
Taking out

388
00:15:22,881 --> 00:15:26,593
all these guys is doable.

389
00:15:26,593 --> 00:15:29,679
But hitting them

390
00:15:26,593 --> 00:15:29,679
in three separate jails

391
00:15:26,593 --> 00:15:29,679
all within two minutes?

392
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:32,473
Whacking Bin Laden

393
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:32,473
wasn't this complicated.

00:28:44,306 --> 00:28:46,892
I mean, you seem good.

592
00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:49,978
Yeah.

593
00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:49,978
I'm hanging in there.

594
00:28:52,272 --> 00:28:55,817
To see you laugh

595
00:28:52,272 --> 00:28:55,817
like that just now...

596
00:28:55,817 --> 00:28:58,237
It's such an improvement,

597
00:28:55,817 --> 00:28:58,237
don't you think?

598
00:29:00,239 --> 00:29:02,408

Hank and I, that

603
00:29:14,253 --> 00:29:17,172
it may be time

604
00:29:14,253 --> 00:29:17,172
to take the kids home.

605
00:29:21,176 --> 00:29:23,970
It's been almost

606
00:29:21,176 --> 00:29:23,970
three months, right?

607
00:29:23,970 --> 00:29:25,389
Almost three?

608
00:29:27,015 --> 00:29:28,392
Um...

609
00:29:30,227 --> 00:29:32,438
Does Hank not want...

610
00:29:32,438 --> 00:29:35,357
Oh, no, no, no.

611
00:29:32,438 --> 00:29:35,357
Oh, god. No. No.

612
00:29:35,357 --> 00:29:38,277
Hank's crazy for these kids.

613
00:29:35,357 --> 00:29:38,277
You know that.

614
00:29:38,277 --> 00:29:40,946
It goes without saying,

615
00:29:38,277 --> 00:29:40,946
we love having them.

616
00:29:40,946 --> 00:29:42,698
And we're always

617
00:29:40,946 --> 00:29:42,698
here for you

618
00:29:42,698 --> 00:29:45,576
and wanna help you

619
00:29:42,698 --> 00:29:45,576
any way that we can.

620
00:29:47,077 --> 00:29:48,454
But...

621
00:29:51,206 --> 00:29:53,751
We're starting to worry

622
00:29:53,751 --> 00:29:55,753
that maybe...

623
00:29:59,256 --> 00:30:01,717
Maybe we're

624
00:29:59,256 --> 00:30:01,717

625
00:30:05,721 --> 00:30:08,223

626
00:30:05,721 --> 00:30:08,223
a lot on your plate,

627
00:30:08,223 --> 00:30:12,311
and you and Walt

628
00:30:08,223 --> 00:30:12,311
have had a lot...

629
00:30:12,311 --> 00:30:16,649
So much

630
00:30:12,311 --> 00:30:16,649
to contend with.

631
00:30:16,649 --> 00:30:19,859
And I'm so proud of you for

632
00:30:16,649 --> 00:30:19,859
going to therapy, by the way.

633
00:30:16,649 --> 00:30:19,859
You know that, right?

634
00:30:19,859 --> 00:30:22,321
It can be so helpful,

635
00:30:19,859 --> 00:30:22,321
such a good tool.

636
00:30:22,321 --> 00:30:26,784
And I'm very,

637
00:30:22,321 --> 00:30:26,784
very proud of you,

638
00:30:26,784 --> 00:30:28,410
but I...

We...

640
00:30:32,998 --> 00:30:34,500
Maybe at this point,

the best way

This is what

653
00:32:49,134 --> 00:32:51,344
you've been working for.

654
00:32:54,473 --> 00:32:57,559
I rented this place,

655
00:32:54,473 --> 00:32:57,559
and I started

656
00:32:54,473 --> 00:32:57,559
bringing it here,

657
00:32:57,559 --> 00:32:58,977
because...

658
00:33:00,103 --> 00:33:03,356
I didn't know

659
00:33:00,103 --> 00:33:03,356
what else to do.

660
00:33:03,356 --> 00:33:05,776
I gave up counting it.

661
00:33:03,356 --> 00:33:05,776
I mean, I had to.

662
00:33:05,776 --> 00:33:09,488
It was just so much,

00:33:05,776 --> 00:33:09,488
so fast.

664
00:33:09,488 --> 00:33:11,907
I tried weighing it.

665
00:33:11,907 --> 00:33:14,576
I figured one bill

666
00:33:14,576 --> 00:33:16,829
of any denomination

667
00:33:14,576 --> 00:33:16,829
weighs a gram.

668
00:33:16,829 --> 00:33:19,414
There are 454 grams

669
00:33:16,829 --> 00:33:19,414

00:33:19,414 --> 00:33:20,999

672
00:33:23,376 --> 00:33:28,841
of denominations, so...

673
00:33:31,426 --> 00:33:32,970
How much is this?

674
00:33:35,347 --> 00:33:37,182
I have no earthly idea.

675
00:33:39,351 --> 00:33:40,894
I truly don't.

676
00:33:41,979 --> 00:33:44,857
I just stack it up,

677
00:33:41,979 --> 00:33:44,857
keep it dry,

715

in the neighborhood,

724
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:55,964

the other day.

00:38:22,383 --> 00:38:24,302

Oh. Oh.

760
00:38:29,515 --> 00:38:32,644
Oh, you saw

761
00:38:29,515 --> 00:38:32,644
the same one as ours?

762
00:38:32,644 --> 00:38:36,106
Yeah. Well,

763
00:38:32,644 --> 00:38:36,106
within a couple years,

764
00:38:32,644 --> 00:38:36,106
I guess.

Early '80s.

766
00:38:37,482 --> 00:38:39,234
It was certainly in

767
00:38:37,482 --> 00:38:39,234
a lot better shape

768
00:38:39,234 --> 00:38:41,069

Yeah. That thing

774
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:50,620
was a nightmare, huh?

775
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:54,249
Oh, it was primitive.

776
00:38:54,249 --> 00:38:56,417
You know, whenever

777
00:38:54,249 --> 00:38:56,417
I hit a red light,

778
00:38:56,417 --> 00:38:58,920
I used to pray

779
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:01,256
it wouldn't

780
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:01,256
crap out on me.

781
00:39:01,256 --> 00:39:03,300
Yeah.

782
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:06,594
And then, suddenly,

783
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:06,594
it would sometimes

784
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:06,594
have that...

785
00:39:06,594 --> 00:39:09,222
That screeching sound

786
00:39:06,594 --> 00:39:09,222

00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:23,653
we ran out of gas

798
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:23,653

00:39:23,653 --> 00:39:26,948
Ah, the gauge.

801
00:39:23,653 --> 00:39:26,948
said half-full, so...

802
00:39:26,948 --> 00:39:29,617
Yeah, you had to

803
00:39:26,948 --> 00:39:29,617
walk three miles

00:39:26,948 --> 00:39:29,617

00:39:38,668 --> 00:39:40,337
We had money.

812
00:39:40,337 --> 00:39:42,255
Why'd we keep it?

813
00:39:42,255 --> 00:39:45,424
