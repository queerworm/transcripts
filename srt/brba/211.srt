00:24:31,887 --> 00:24:34,181
Shot at and missed.

575
00:24:31,887 --> 00:24:34,181
Shit on and hit.

576
00:24:34,181 --> 00:24:35,808
Wa-Wait a minute.

577
00:24:35,808 --> 00:24:38,227
How can he make that decision

578
00:24:35,808 --> 00:24:38,227
without even meeting me?

579
00:24:38,227 --> 00:24:39,937
<i>I told you,</i>

580
00:24:38,227 --> 00:24:39,937

00:24:39,937 --> 00:24:41,688
<i>all right?</i>

583
00:24:41,688 --> 00:24:46,444
He's skittish, like a deer.

584
00:24:48,028 --> 00:24:49,487
Call him back.

585
00:24:49,487 --> 00:24:51,907
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

586
00:24:49,487 --> 00:24:51,907
<i>I can't do that.</i>

587
00:24:51,907 --> 00:24:54,701
Yes, you can. Call him, Saul.

588
00:24:54,701 --> 00:24:57,163
Hey, first of all,

589
00:24:54,701 --> 00:24:57,163
I never called him, all right?

590
00:24:57,163 --> 00:24:59,665
I called a guy who called a guy

591
00:24:57,163 --> 00:24:59,665
who called a guy.

592
00:24:59,665 --> 00:25:01,375
Second of all, it's over.

593
00:25:01,375 --> 00:25:04,170

Look, I'll see if I can scrape

598

something else together,

599
00:25:12,136 --> 00:25:13,846

00:25:13,846 --> 00:25:16,098

Ah! Damn it.

[♪♪♪]

604
00:26:58,616 --> 00:27:00,077
Lucy, you must

605
00:26:58,616 --> 00:27:00,077
remember to have

606
00:27:00,077 --> 00:27:02,288
the salt and pepper

607
00:27:00,077 --> 00:27:02,288
shakers wiped.

608
00:27:09,086 --> 00:27:11,422
Can I help you, sir?

609
00:27:12,714 --> 00:27:15,050
Diet Coke, please.

610
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:19,763
And five minutes of your time.

611
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:33,777
What can I do for you?

612
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:33,777
Have a seat.

613
00:27:34,736 --> 00:27:36,363
Please.

614
00:27:47,707 --> 00:27:52,087
I would like to know why you

615
00:27:47,707 --> 00:27:52,087
wouldn't meet with me yesterday.

616
00:27:53,339 --> 00:27:56,758
I'm sorry.

617
00:27:53,339 --> 00:27:56,758
I'm not following.

618
00:27:56,758 --> 00:28:02,139
I sat here yesterday,

619
00:27:56,758 --> 00:28:02,139
waiting to meet with someone.

620
00:28:02,139 --> 00:28:05,017
I believe that person was you.

621
00:28:05,017 --> 00:28:08,604
I think that you're

622
00:28:05,017 --> 00:28:08,604
confusing me for someone else.

623
00:28:09,687 --> 00:28:11,357
I don't think I am.

624
00:28:15,277 --> 00:28:17,237
Sir, if you have a complaint,

625
00:28:17,237 --> 00:28:19,657
I suggest you submit it

626
00:28:17,237 --> 00:28:19,657
through our e-mail system.

627
00:28:19,657 --> 00:28:22,451
I would be happy to refer you

628
00:28:19,657 --> 00:28:22,451
to our website.

629
00:28:24,036 --> 00:28:25,454
I was told that the man

630
00:28:25,454 --> 00:28:29,416
I would be meeting with

631
00:28:25,454 --> 00:28:29,416
is very careful.

632
00:28:29,416 --> 00:28:32,211
A cautious man.

633
00:28:32,211 --> 00:28:35,255
I believe we're

634
00:28:32,211 --> 00:28:35,255
alike in that way.

635
00:28:37,174 --> 00:28:41,387
If you are who

636
00:28:37,174 --> 00:28:41,387
I think you are,

637
00:28:41,387 --> 00:28:43,722
you should give me

638
00:28:41,387 --> 00:28:43,722
another chance.

639
00:28:48,644 --> 00:28:51,689
I don't think we're

640
00:28:48,644 --> 00:28:51,689
alike at all, Mr. White.

641
00:28:53,315 --> 00:28:56,193
You are not

642
00:28:53,315 --> 00:28:56,193
a cautious man at all.

643
00:28:56,193 --> 00:28:59,488
Your partner was late,

644
00:28:56,193 --> 00:28:59,488
and he was high.

645
00:28:59,488 --> 00:29:03,409
Yes. Yes, he was.

646
00:29:03,409 --> 00:29:07,413
He's high often, isn't he?

647
00:29:10,957 --> 00:29:12,792
You have poor judgment.

648
00:29:14,378 --> 00:29:16,380
I can't work with someone

649
00:29:14,378 --> 00:29:16,380
with poor judgment.

650
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:19,550
Are you familiar

651
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:19,550
with my product?

652
00:29:19,550 --> 00:29:23,803
I've been told it's excellent.

653
00:29:19,550 --> 00:29:23,803
It is impeccable.

654
00:29:24,722 --> 00:29:26,348
It is the purest,

655
00:29:26,348 --> 00:29:30,143
most chemically sound product

656
00:29:26,348 --> 00:29:30,143
on the market anywhere.

657
00:29:30,143 --> 00:29:33,230
That is not the only factor.

658
00:29:33,230 --> 00:29:35,649
You could charge twice

659
00:29:33,230 --> 00:29:35,649
the current rate

660
00:29:35,649 --> 00:29:36,858
for what I provide,

661
00:29:36,858 --> 00:29:39,486
and your customers

662
00:29:36,858 --> 00:29:39,486
would pay it.

663
00:29:39,486 --> 00:29:42,281
Hands down.

664
00:29:42,281 --> 00:29:46,535
Now, who I choose to do

665
00:29:42,281 --> 00:29:46,535
business with on my end

666
00:29:46,535 --> 00:29:49,663
is not your problem.

667
00:29:49,663 --> 00:29:51,248
You won't see him.

668
00:29:51,248 --> 00:29:54,585
You won't interact with him.

669
00:29:54,585 --> 00:29:56,378
Forget he exists.

670
00:29:57,630 --> 00:30:00,132
I have to ask.

671
00:30:01,759 --> 00:30:03,093
Why?

672
00:30:03,093 --> 00:30:04,970
Why him?

673
00:30:07,222 --> 00:30:10,183
Because he does what I say.

674
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:14,146
Because I can trust him.

675
00:30:15,606 --> 00:30:17,941
How much product

676
00:30:15,606 --> 00:30:17,941
do you have on hand?

677
00:30:17,941 --> 00:30:20,527
Thirty-eight pounds.

678
00:30:20,527 --> 00:30:23,405
Ready to go

679
00:30:20,527 --> 00:30:23,405
at a moment's notice.

680
00:30:29,161 --> 00:30:31,497
Will I hear from you?

681
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,542
I have your numbers.

682
00:30:39,463 --> 00:30:43,425
You can never trust

683
00:30:39,463 --> 00:30:43,425
a drug addict.

684
00:30:58,398 --> 00:31:00,693
<i>Look, I mean,</i>

685
00:30:58,398 --> 00:31:00,693
<i>it's all kind of little</i>

686
00:31:00,693 --> 00:31:02,027
dribs and drabs,

687
00:31:02,027 --> 00:31:04,697
but right here,

688
00:31:02,027 --> 00:31:04,697
take Keller, for instance.

689
00:31:04,697 --> 00:31:08,575
A couple hundred dollars here,

690
00:31:04,697 --> 00:31:08,575
a few thousand there.

691
00:31:08,575 --> 00:31:10,577
Dribs and drabs. Huh.

692
00:31:10,577 --> 00:31:12,454
Once you add it all up,

693
00:31:10,577 --> 00:31:12,454
though, with Keller,

694
00:31:12,454 --> 00:31:14,373
the revenues are almost

695
00:31:12,454 --> 00:31:14,373
10 percent less

696
00:31:14,373 --> 00:31:16,166
than was actually received.

697
00:31:16,166 --> 00:31:21,463
And this is every quarter

698
00:31:16,166 --> 00:31:21,463
for the last two years.

699
00:31:22,589 --> 00:31:24,257
I, um...

700
00:31:24,257 --> 00:31:25,467
When I saw that,

701
00:31:24,257 --> 00:31:25,467
I got worried

702
00:31:25,467 --> 00:31:27,219
so I checked

703
00:31:25,467 --> 00:31:27,219
Accounts Receivable

704
00:31:27,219 --> 00:31:28,261
and their customers.

705
00:31:28,261 --> 00:31:31,306
I found six other instances.

706
00:31:32,474 --> 00:31:35,811
Revenues being

707
00:31:32,474 --> 00:31:35,811
under-reported.

708
00:31:35,811 --> 00:31:38,856
And I've only just started

709
00:31:35,811 --> 00:31:38,856
to look into it.

710
00:31:38,856 --> 00:31:42,359
We have requirement contracts

711
00:31:38,856 --> 00:31:42,359
with a lot of these companies.

712
00:31:42,359 --> 00:31:44,737
They have to anticipate their

713
00:31:42,359 --> 00:31:44,737
needs for the next quarter.

714
00:31:44,737 --> 00:31:46,946
Now, most of the time,

715
00:31:44,737 --> 00:31:46,946
they overestimate.

716
00:31:46,946 --> 00:31:49,575
I let them roll their overages

717
00:31:46,946 --> 00:31:49,575
into the next order,

718
00:31:49,575 --> 00:31:51,910
and if I don't,

719
00:31:49,575 --> 00:31:51,910
they'll go elsewhere.

720
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:53,746
Obviously, we forgot,

721
00:31:53,746 --> 00:31:57,791
or didn't go back and adjust

722
00:31:53,746 --> 00:31:57,791
the revenue entries.

723
00:31:57,791 --> 00:32:00,919
I-I know it's wrong from

724
00:31:57,791 --> 00:32:00,919
an accounting standpoint,

725
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:02,421
but as you can see,

726
00:32:02,421 --> 00:32:05,215
the money's coming

727
00:32:02,421 --> 00:32:05,215
in eventually, as you can see.

728
00:32:06,174 --> 00:32:07,885
Right.

729
00:32:07,885 --> 00:32:09,595
Right, but, um,

730
00:32:09,595 --> 00:32:11,388
I got the old bills of sale

731
00:32:11,388 --> 00:32:13,181
and order forms

732
00:32:11,388 --> 00:32:13,181
out of storage, you know,

733
00:32:13,181 --> 00:32:17,310
to try and sort

734
00:32:13,181 --> 00:32:17,310
this out and, um--

735
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:18,978
Most of the time,

736
00:32:18,978 --> 00:32:22,065
there's no backup for

737
00:32:18,978 --> 00:32:22,065
the reported revenues at all.

738
00:32:23,483 --> 00:32:25,569
In a few cases...

739
00:32:26,945 --> 00:32:30,783
I found xeroxed copies

740
00:32:26,945 --> 00:32:30,783
with the dates changed.

741
00:32:33,201 --> 00:32:34,994
Ted.

742
00:32:38,624 --> 00:32:40,125
Hm.

743
00:32:45,046 --> 00:32:47,382
All right.

744
00:32:47,382 --> 00:32:50,218
Heh. You got me.

745
00:32:50,218 --> 00:32:55,891
We're talking nearly a million

746
00:32:50,218 --> 00:32:55,891
dollars of undocumented revenue.

747
00:32:55,891 --> 00:32:59,311
What are you thinking?

748
00:32:55,891 --> 00:32:59,311
I'm thinking

749
00:32:59,311 --> 00:33:01,605
about saving a company.

750
00:33:01,605 --> 00:33:03,649
I'm thinking about

751
00:33:01,605 --> 00:33:03,649
people's jobs,

752
00:33:03,649 --> 00:33:05,651
about their mortgages

753
00:33:03,649 --> 00:33:05,651
and pensions,

754
00:33:05,651 --> 00:33:09,195
and their college funds

755
00:33:05,651 --> 00:33:09,195
for their kids.

756
00:33:09,195 --> 00:33:11,156
Not to mention my own.

757
00:33:11,156 --> 00:33:13,992
It doesn't mean that you

758
00:33:11,156 --> 00:33:13,992
have to break the law.

759
00:33:13,992 --> 00:33:15,702
Yes, it does, Skyler.

760
00:33:15,702 --> 00:33:17,996
It's right there in the books.

761
00:33:15,702 --> 00:33:17,996
Business is terrible.

762
00:33:17,996 --> 00:33:19,205
The bank is on my back,

763
00:33:19,205 --> 00:33:21,458
the IRS is grinding

764
00:33:19,205 --> 00:33:21,458
me down to a nub.

765
00:33:21,458 --> 00:33:23,168
