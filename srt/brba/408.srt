199

Oh, well, I can't see

200
00:07:34,579 --> 00:07:37,958
how that would be necessary.

out what this is all about.

206
00:07:46,883 --> 00:07:49,677
Sir, your fingerprints

207
00:07:46,883 --> 00:07:49,677
were found at a crime scene.

208
00:07:50,971 --> 00:07:54,224
Really?

209
00:07:50,971 --> 00:07:54,224
That's surprising.

213
00:08:02,523 --> 00:08:05,444
Gale Boetticher's apartment.

214
00:08:09,406 --> 00:08:11,283
So you knew the victim?

215
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:20,500
Fifteen years ago, I established

216
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:20,500
a chemistry scholarship at UNM.

217
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:23,378
I named it

218
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:23,378
after Maximino Arciniega,

219
00:08:23,378 --> 00:08:25,797
a dear friend of mine

220
00:08:23,378 --> 00:08:25,797
who died too young.

221
00:08:25,797 --> 00:08:28,508
Gale was a recipient

222
00:08:25,797 --> 00:08:28,508
of this scholarship.

223
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:32,846
He was perhaps

224
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:32,846
one of three dozen.

225
00:08:32,846 --> 00:08:35,182
I see.

226
00:08:35,182 --> 00:08:39,519
And Mr. Boetticher

227
00:08:35,182 --> 00:08:39,519
graduated in...

228
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,646
1999.

229
00:08:41,646 --> 00:08:43,231
That sounds right.

230
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:45,566
And you kept in contact with him

231
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:45,566
over all this time?

232
00:08:45,566 --> 00:08:47,319
Oh, no. I hadn't

233
00:08:45,566 --> 00:08:47,319
seen Gale for years

234
00:08:47,319 --> 00:08:50,280
until I ran into him

235
00:08:47,319 --> 00:08:50,280
a few weeks ago.

236
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,615
Ran into him where?

237
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,615
At the restaurant.

238
00:08:53,992 --> 00:08:56,995
Uh, well, "ran into"

239
00:08:53,992 --> 00:08:56,995
isn't quite accurate,

240
00:08:56,995 --> 00:08:59,914

241
00:08:56,995 --> 00:08:59,914
to re-establish contact with me.

We caught up briefly.

243
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:05,253
He invited me to dinner the

244
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:05,253
following night and I accepted.

245
00:09:06,921 --> 00:09:11,259
It was perhaps a week later when

246
00:09:06,921 --> 00:09:11,259
I read about him in the paper.

247
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:12,593

00:09:12,593 --> 00:09:14,137
It's a good possibility.

250
00:09:14,137 --> 00:09:16,597
The paper made

251
00:09:14,137 --> 00:09:16,597
no mention of that.

252
00:09:16,597 --> 00:09:19,518
I assumed

253
00:09:16,597 --> 00:09:19,518

00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:23,813
he shows up

257
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:23,813
in your restaurant,

He wanted money.

262
00:09:27,942 --> 00:09:29,528

264
00:09:29,528 --> 00:09:31,279
He didn't come out and say that.

265
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:35,742
He spoke in terms of a vague

investment opportunity.

267
00:09:35,742 --> 00:09:37,411
But it was my suspicion, yes,

268
00:09:37,411 --> 00:09:39,829
as to why he invited me

269
00:09:37,411 --> 00:09:39,829
into his home.

270
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:42,249

I never understood,

274
00:09:45,293 --> 00:09:48,629
he was more interested

275
00:09:45,293 --> 00:09:48,629
in taking shortcuts

276
00:09:48,629 --> 00:09:52,592

notwithstanding,

he was a warm, gentle person,

00:09:57,347 --> 00:09:59,974
and I thought a lot of him.

282
00:10:01,726 --> 00:10:06,064
At any rate, I, uh,

283
00:10:01,726 --> 00:10:06,064
declined his business offer.

were human rights abuses.
