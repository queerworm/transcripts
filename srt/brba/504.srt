00:33:24,085 --> 00:33:27,172
on the phone,

946
00:33:27,172 --> 00:33:29,466
and after much discussion,

947
00:33:29,466 --> 00:33:31,927

00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:24,437
Now I'm running things.

979
00:34:24,437 --> 00:34:27,357
So wait.

980
00:34:24,437 --> 00:34:27,357
Now that you're in charge,

981
00:34:27,357 --> 00:34:30,318
it's what...

982
00:34:27,357 --> 00:34:30,318
It's gonna be smooth sailing

983
00:34:27,357 --> 00:34:30,318
from here on out?

984
00:34:30,318 --> 00:34:32,111
I don't see why not.

985
00:34:32,111 --> 00:34:36,742
I keep the work

986
00:34:32,111 --> 00:34:36,742
at work, Skyler,

987
00:34:36,742 --> 00:34:39,036
and nothing will ever

988
00:34:36,742 --> 00:34:39,036
impact you or the kids.

989
00:34:39,036 --> 00:34:41,955
You don't know that.

990
00:34:39,036 --> 00:34:41,955
You can't make

991
00:34:39,036 --> 00:34:41,955
that promise, Walt.

992
00:34:41,955 --> 00:34:44,875
I can promise you

993
00:34:41,955 --> 00:34:44,875
that Gus Fring is dead.

994
00:34:44,875 --> 00:34:47,293
And he was the threat.

995
00:34:44,875 --> 00:34:47,293
He was the danger.

996
00:34:47,293 --> 00:34:50,005
I thought you

997
00:34:47,293 --> 00:34:50,005
were the danger.

998
00:34:57,345 --> 00:34:59,848
Is that what

999
00:34:57,345 --> 00:34:59,848
your pool stunt

1000
00:34:57,345 --> 00:34:59,848
was about?

1001
00:34:59,848 --> 00:35:02,183
Trying to protect

1002
00:34:59,848 --> 00:35:02,183
my children from me?

1003
00:35:02,183 --> 00:35:03,643
Not just...

1004
00:35:04,853 --> 00:35:06,772
There's blood

1005
00:35:04,853 --> 00:35:06,772
on my hands too.

1006
00:35:06,772 --> 00:35:09,858
What blood? Beneke?

1007
00:35:09,858 --> 00:35:12,193
He's in the hospital

1008
00:35:09,858 --> 00:35:12,193
because of me.

1009
00:35:12,193 --> 00:35:13,946
No.

1010
00:35:12,193 --> 00:35:13,946
Because of what I did.

1011
00:35:13,946 --> 00:35:16,573
Skyler, you can't

1012
00:35:13,946 --> 00:35:16,573
beat yourself up

1013
00:35:13,946 --> 00:35:16,573
over this thing.

1014
00:35:16,573 --> 00:35:19,659
Please. You didn't set out

1015
00:35:16,573 --> 00:35:19,659
to hurt anybody.

1016
00:35:19,659 --> 00:35:21,995
You made a mistake,

1017
00:35:19,659 --> 00:35:21,995
and things got out

1018
00:35:19,659 --> 00:35:21,995
of control,

1019
00:35:21,995 --> 00:35:24,372
but you did

1020
00:35:21,995 --> 00:35:24,372
what you had to do

1021
00:35:21,995 --> 00:35:24,372
to protect your family.

1022
00:35:24,372 --> 00:35:27,042
And I'm sorry.

1023
00:35:24,372 --> 00:35:27,042
That doesn't make you

1024
00:35:24,372 --> 00:35:27,042
a bad person,

1025
00:35:27,042 --> 00:35:28,376
it makes you

1026
00:35:27,042 --> 00:35:28,376
a human being.

1027
00:35:28,376 --> 00:35:32,338
Stop it, Walt.

1028
00:35:28,376 --> 00:35:32,338
Just stop.

1029
00:35:32,338 --> 00:35:35,174
I don't need to hear any

1030
00:35:32,338 --> 00:35:35,174
of your bullshit rationales.

1031
00:35:35,174 --> 00:35:36,718
I'm in it now.

1032
00:35:36,718 --> 00:35:38,887
I'm compromised.

1033
00:35:36,718 --> 00:35:38,887
But I won't...

1034
00:35:38,887 --> 00:35:42,140
I will not have my children

1035
00:35:38,887 --> 00:35:42,140
living in a house

1036
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:46,144
where dealing drugs

1037
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:46,144
and hurting people

1038
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:46,144
and killing people

1039
00:35:46,144 --> 00:35:49,230
is shrugged off

1040
00:35:46,144 --> 00:35:49,230
as "shit happens."

1041
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:51,316
We're back at it?

1042
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:51,316
Fine.

1043
00:35:51,316 --> 00:35:54,694
But the kids stay away,

1044
00:35:51,316 --> 00:35:54,694
and that's that.

1045
00:35:54,694 --> 00:35:56,029
"That's that"?

1046
00:35:54,694 --> 00:35:56,029
That's what?

1047
00:35:56,029 --> 00:35:58,073
I got them

1048
00:35:56,029 --> 00:35:58,073
out of this house.

1049
00:35:58,073 --> 00:36:00,993
To a sleepover

1050
00:35:58,073 --> 00:36:00,993
at their aunt and uncle's?

1051
00:36:00,993 --> 00:36:02,786
They spend a day or two,

1052
00:36:02,786 --> 00:36:05,705
Junior stays up late

1053
00:36:02,786 --> 00:36:05,705
watching movies,

1054
00:36:02,786 --> 00:36:05,705
and then what happens?

1055
00:36:05,705 --> 00:36:06,915
We'll see.

1056
00:36:06,915 --> 00:36:08,249
No, I'll tell you

1057
00:36:06,915 --> 00:36:08,249
what happens.

1058
00:36:08,249 --> 00:36:10,627
They come home

1059
00:36:08,249 --> 00:36:10,627
to this house,

1060
00:36:10,627 --> 00:36:12,087
to their parents

1061
00:36:10,627 --> 00:36:12,087
who love them.

1062
00:36:12,087 --> 00:36:14,589
No. I will not let

1063
00:36:12,087 --> 00:36:14,589
our business endanger them.

1064
00:36:14,589 --> 00:36:17,050
How many times

1065
00:36:14,589 --> 00:36:17,050
do I have to say

1066
00:36:14,589 --> 00:36:17,050
that they are not in...

1067
00:36:17,050 --> 00:36:18,426
I said no.

1068
00:36:18,426 --> 00:36:22,388
I swear to God,

1069
00:36:18,426 --> 00:36:22,388
I won't have them back here.

1070
00:36:28,227 --> 00:36:30,396
What are you gonna do

1071
00:36:28,227 --> 00:36:30,396
to stop it?

1072
00:36:32,398 --> 00:36:36,820
Whatever it takes.

1073
00:36:32,398 --> 00:36:36,820
Everything in my power.

1074
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:39,156
Like what?

1075
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:39,156
I mean, specifically.

1076
00:36:39,156 --> 00:36:40,824
What is your next move?

1077
00:36:40,824 --> 00:36:43,409
My next move

1078
00:36:40,824 --> 00:36:43,409
is maybe I hurt myself.

1079
00:36:43,409 --> 00:36:45,537
Make it clear

1080
00:36:43,409 --> 00:36:45,537
we need more time.

1081
00:36:45,537 --> 00:36:47,873
Let Hank and Marie see

1082
00:36:45,537 --> 00:36:47,873
we're still struggling.

1083
00:36:47,873 --> 00:36:49,708
No, more like

1084
00:36:47,873 --> 00:36:49,708
you're still struggling.

1085
00:36:49,708 --> 00:36:52,127
So maybe next time,

1086
00:36:49,708 --> 00:36:52,127
I have you committed.

1087
00:36:52,127 --> 00:36:54,379
Put you in some

1088
00:36:52,127 --> 00:36:54,379
inpatient facility

1089
00:36:54,379 --> 00:36:55,964
while I take care

1090
00:36:54,379 --> 00:36:55,964
of the kids myself.

1091
00:36:55,964 --> 00:36:58,257
Is that what

1092
00:36:55,964 --> 00:36:58,257
you want?

1093
00:36:58,257 --> 00:37:02,012
So then maybe I show up

1094
00:36:58,257 --> 00:37:02,012
with bruises on my neck,

1095
00:37:02,012 --> 00:37:03,680
give myself a black eye,

1096
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:05,849
say that you beat me

1097
00:37:05,849 --> 00:37:08,060
when you found out

1098
00:37:05,849 --> 00:37:08,060
about my lover.

1099
00:37:10,103 --> 00:37:11,646
I see.

1100
00:37:13,190 --> 00:37:15,025
So you want

1101
00:37:13,190 --> 00:37:15,025
to involve Ted?

1102
00:37:15,025 --> 00:37:16,609
Oh, well,

1103
00:37:15,025 --> 00:37:16,609
that'll be fun,

1104
00:37:16,609 --> 00:37:18,904
bringing the police

1105
00:37:16,609 --> 00:37:18,904
up to speed on all of that.

1106
00:37:18,904 --> 00:37:22,240
But not as much fun

1107
00:37:18,904 --> 00:37:22,240
as telling your

1108
00:37:18,904 --> 00:37:22,240
16-year-old son

1109
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:25,451
that his father

1110
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:25,451
is a wife-beater.

1111
00:37:25,451 --> 00:37:27,913
Also not a very good plan.

1112
00:37:25,451 --> 00:37:27,913
What else you got?

1113
00:37:27,913 --> 00:37:30,665
I could send Junior

1114
00:37:27,913 --> 00:37:30,665
away to school.

1115
00:37:30,665 --> 00:37:32,584
Oh. Now here's

1116
00:37:30,665 --> 00:37:32,584
the conversation...

1117
00:37:32,584 --> 00:37:35,837
"So, honey,

1118
00:37:32,584 --> 00:37:35,837
I know you've only got

1119
00:37:32,584 --> 00:37:35,837
one year left in high school,

1120
00:37:35,837 --> 00:37:38,423
"but I would love it so much

1121
00:37:35,837 --> 00:37:38,423
if you would drop everything,

1122
00:37:38,423 --> 00:37:39,841
"leave all

1123
00:37:38,423 --> 00:37:39,841
your friends behind,

1124
00:37:39,841 --> 00:37:41,843
"and go to boarding school

1125
00:37:39,841 --> 00:37:41,843
in Arizona."

1126
00:37:41,843 --> 00:37:44,554
You have any other ideas?

1127
00:37:41,843 --> 00:37:44,554
Because I'm not hearing

1128
00:37:44,554 --> 00:37:46,181
a solution

1129
00:37:44,554 --> 00:37:46,181
to your problem.

1130
00:37:46,181 --> 00:37:49,101
How are you going

1131
00:37:46,181 --> 00:37:49,101
to save our kids

1132
00:37:49,101 --> 00:37:51,686
from this

1133
00:37:49,101 --> 00:37:51,686
terrible environment?

1134
00:37:51,686 --> 00:37:53,105
I don't...

1135
00:37:51,686 --> 00:37:53,105
What are you gonna do?

1136
00:37:53,105 --> 00:37:54,731
Are you gonna run off

1137
00:37:53,105 --> 00:37:54,731
to France?

1138
00:37:54,731 --> 00:37:57,067
Are you gonna

1139
00:37:54,731 --> 00:37:57,067
close the curtains,

1140
00:37:54,731 --> 00:37:57,067
change the locks?

1141
00:37:57,067 --> 00:37:58,777
This is a joke.

1142
00:37:57,067 --> 00:37:58,777
Come on, Skyler.

1143
00:37:58,777 --> 00:38:03,406
You wanna take me on?

1144
00:37:58,777 --> 00:38:03,406
You wanna take away

1145
00:37:58,777 --> 00:38:03,406
my children?

1146
00:38:03,406 --> 00:38:06,576
What's the plan?

1147
00:38:03,406 --> 00:38:06,576
I don't know!

1148
00:38:06,576 --> 00:38:08,620
This is the best

1149
00:38:06,576 --> 00:38:08,620
I could come up with, okay?

1150
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:12,124
I... I will count

1151
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:12,124
every minute

1152
00:38:12,124 --> 00:38:13,708
that the kids

1153
00:38:12,124 --> 00:38:13,708
are away from here,

1154
00:38:13,708 --> 00:38:16,253
away from you,

1155
00:38:13,708 --> 00:38:16,253
as a victory.

1156
00:38:16,253 --> 00:38:19,214
But you're right.

1157
00:38:19,214 --> 00:38:20,715
It's a bad plan.

1158
00:38:22,259 --> 00:38:26,387
I don't have any

1159
00:38:22,259 --> 00:38:26,387
of your magic, Walt.

1160
00:38:26,387 --> 00:38:27,889
I don't know

1161
00:38:26,387 --> 00:38:27,889
what to do.

1162
00:38:27,889 --> 00:38:30,433
I'm a coward.

1163
00:38:30,433 --> 00:38:32,811
I... I can't go

1164
00:38:30,433 --> 00:38:32,811
to the police.

1165
00:38:32,811 --> 00:38:34,437
I can't stop

1166
00:38:32,811 --> 00:38:34,437
laundering your money.

1167
00:38:34,437 --> 00:38:36,397
I can't keep you

1168
00:38:34,437 --> 00:38:36,397
out of this house.

1169
00:38:36,397 --> 00:38:39,776
I can't even keep you

1170
00:38:36,397 --> 00:38:39,776
out of my bed.

1171
00:38:39,776 --> 00:38:43,696
All I can do is wait.

1172
00:38:43,696 --> 00:38:45,740
That's it.

1173
00:38:43,696 --> 00:38:45,740
That's the only good option.

1174
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:47,575
Hold on,

1175
00:38:47,575 --> 00:38:49,619
bide my time,

1176
00:38:49,619 --> 00:38:51,746
and wait.

1177
00:38:53,498 --> 00:38:55,959
Wait for what?

1178
00:38:53,498 --> 00:38:55,959
What are you waiting for?

1179
00:38:57,669 --> 00:39:00,755
For the cancer

1180
00:38:57,669 --> 00:39:00,755
to come back.

1181
00:39:37,042 --> 00:39:38,877
[BUZZING]

1182
00:39:48,845 --> 00:39:50,388
Yeah?

1183
00:39:52,182 --> 00:39:54,392
Okay. Okay.

1184
00:39:54,392 --> 00:39:56,311
Just relax.

1185
00:39:54,392 --> 00:39:56,311
I'm coming.

1186
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:11,784
JESSE:

1187
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:11,784
You tell me

1188
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:11,784
what that looks like.

1189
00:40:11,784 --> 00:40:13,370
If the D.E.A.'s tracking

1190
00:40:11,784 --> 00:40:13,370
her barrels,

1191
00:40:13,370 --> 00:40:15,163
there goes

1192
00:40:13,370 --> 00:40:15,163
our precursor connection.

1193
00:40:15,163 --> 00:40:17,874
That's done.

1194
00:40:15,163 --> 00:40:17,874
And I'm telling you,

1195
00:40:15,163 --> 00:40:17,874
these days,

1196
00:40:17,874 --> 00:40:20,668

1197
00:40:17,874 --> 00:40:20,668
a new methylamine hook-up

1198
00:40:17,874 --> 00:40:20,668
is rare, man.

1199
00:40:20,668 --> 00:40:22,545
It's like Bigfoot.

1200
00:40:20,668 --> 00:40:22,545
Like unicorn-rare.

1201
00:40:22,545 --> 00:40:27,675
Kid, it's just...

1202
00:40:22,545 --> 00:40:27,675
You're giving me

1203
00:40:22,545 --> 00:40:27,675
heartburn here.

1204
00:40:27,675 --> 00:40:30,262
G.P.S. on the bottom

1205
00:40:27,675 --> 00:40:30,262
of the barrel.

1206
00:40:30,262 --> 00:40:32,680
Why didn't they put it inside

1207
00:40:30,262 --> 00:40:32,680
where nobody would see it?

1208
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:34,599
Look, it's inside,

1209
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:34,599
it gets wet.

1210
00:40:34,599 --> 00:40:36,976
They made these things

1211
00:40:34,599 --> 00:40:36,976
to put under cars.

1212
00:40:36,976 --> 00:40:38,603
They can get wet.

1213
00:40:38,603 --> 00:40:40,146
Huh.

1214
00:40:40,146 --> 00:40:42,815
Even by cop standards

1215
00:40:40,146 --> 00:40:42,815
this is sloppy.

1216
00:40:42,815 --> 00:40:44,317
And the other barrels...

1217
00:40:44,317 --> 00:40:47,195
They have trackers

1218
00:40:44,317 --> 00:40:47,195
on the outside too?

1219
00:40:47,195 --> 00:40:48,821
I don't know.

1220
00:40:47,195 --> 00:40:48,821
Probably.

1221
00:40:50,323 --> 00:40:53,326
You didn't check any of

1222
00:40:50,323 --> 00:40:53,326
the other barrels?

1223
00:40:50,323 --> 00:40:53,326
No.

1224
00:40:53,326 --> 00:40:55,954
But that's the only one

1225
00:40:53,326 --> 00:40:55,954
we could've taken,

1226
00:40:53,326 --> 00:40:55,954
according to her.

1227
00:40:55,954 --> 00:40:57,830
Once we spotted it,

1228
00:40:55,954 --> 00:40:57,830
she freaked out,

1229
00:40:57,830 --> 00:41:00,333
I put the barrel back,

1230
00:40:57,830 --> 00:41:00,333
and we F.O.'d.

1231
00:41:00,333 --> 00:41:02,294
Let me

1232
00:41:00,333 --> 00:41:02,294
ask you something.

1233
00:41:02,294 --> 00:41:04,963
The person

1234
00:41:02,294 --> 00:41:04,963
who spotted this...

1235
00:41:04,963 --> 00:41:06,965
Was it you

1236
00:41:04,963 --> 00:41:06,965
or was it her?

1237
00:41:06,965 --> 00:41:09,634
Lydia.

1238
00:41:06,965 --> 00:41:09,634
She saw it first.

1239
00:41:09,634 --> 00:41:12,345
Okay.

1240
00:41:12,345 --> 00:41:13,972
She's dead.

1241
00:41:13,972 --> 00:41:15,890
Wait, wait, wait.

1242
00:41:13,972 --> 00:41:15,890
What?

1243
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:19,018
Lydia planted this thing,

1244
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:19,018
not the cops.

1245
00:41:19,018 --> 00:41:20,561
She's thinking

1246
00:41:19,018 --> 00:41:20,561
if she makes it look

1247
00:41:20,561 --> 00:41:22,439
like her inventory's

1248
00:41:20,561 --> 00:41:22,439
being watched

1249
00:41:22,439 --> 00:41:25,233
that we'll leave her alone

1250
00:41:22,439 --> 00:41:25,233
and take our business

1251
00:41:22,439 --> 00:41:25,233
elsewhere.

1252
00:41:25,233 --> 00:41:26,818
And she's right.

1253
00:41:26,818 --> 00:41:29,570
We will be taking

1254
00:41:26,818 --> 00:41:29,570
our business elsewhere,

1255
00:41:29,570 --> 00:41:32,031
right after I leave her

1256
00:41:29,570 --> 00:41:32,031
alone in a ditch.

1257
00:41:32,031 --> 00:41:34,409
But wait, hey,

1258
00:41:32,031 --> 00:41:34,409
if the D.E.A.'s not

1259
00:41:32,031 --> 00:41:34,409
tracking her stuff,

1260
00:41:34,409 --> 00:41:36,411
that's a good thing,

1261
00:41:34,409 --> 00:41:36,411
right?

1262
00:41:36,411 --> 00:41:38,288
I mean, all we gotta do

1263
00:41:36,411 --> 00:41:38,288
is tell her to,

1264
00:41:38,288 --> 00:41:40,915
you know, cut the crap

1265
00:41:38,288 --> 00:41:40,915
and keep the methylamine

1266
00:41:38,288 --> 00:41:40,915
coming.

1267
00:41:40,915 --> 00:41:43,084
You don't know

1268
00:41:40,915 --> 00:41:43,084
this woman like I do.

1269
00:41:43,084 --> 00:41:45,878
I had a chance

1270
00:41:43,084 --> 00:41:45,878
to deal with this before,

1271
00:41:43,084 --> 00:41:45,878
and I gave her a pass.

1272
00:41:45,878 --> 00:41:47,922
That's what I get

1273
00:41:45,878 --> 00:41:47,922
for being sexist.

1274
00:41:47,922 --> 00:41:49,424
Now, if you'll excuse me...

1275
00:41:49,424 --> 00:41:51,843
Mike, you can't just...

1276
00:41:51,843 --> 00:41:54,012
Look, that's our precursor.

1277
00:41:51,843 --> 00:41:54,012
We need her.

1278
00:41:54,012 --> 00:41:57,474
Kid, if we have to ramp down

1279
00:41:54,012 --> 00:41:57,474
for a while, so be it.

1280
00:41:57,474 --> 00:41:59,767
It beats working

1281
00:41:57,474 --> 00:41:59,767
with a lunatic

1282
00:41:59,767 --> 00:42:01,560
who's gonna get us arrested

1283
00:41:59,767 --> 00:42:01,560
or killed.

1284
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:03,604
Look, she didn't seem crazy

1285
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:03,604
to me, you know?

1286
00:42:03,604 --> 00:42:06,191
She just seemed,

1287
00:42:03,604 --> 00:42:06,191
like, uptight.

1288
00:42:06,191 --> 00:42:08,109
And now

1289
00:42:06,191 --> 00:42:08,109
you're being sexist.

1290
00:42:08,109 --> 00:42:11,070
Trust me,

1291
00:42:08,109 --> 00:42:11,070
this woman deserves to die

1292
00:42:11,070 --> 00:42:13,656
as much as any man

1293
00:42:11,070 --> 00:42:13,656
I've ever met.

1294
00:42:13,656 --> 00:42:14,907
No. Wait!

1295
00:42:14,907 --> 00:42:17,452
Just wait.

1296
00:42:17,452 --> 00:42:19,620
What if this really was

1297
00:42:17,452 --> 00:42:19,620
the cops, you know?

1298
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:21,247
And what if

1299
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:21,247
you're wrong about her?

1300
00:42:21,247 --> 00:42:22,499
I'm not wrong.

1301
00:42:22,499 --> 00:42:25,043
But what if you are?

1302
00:42:25,043 --> 00:42:29,172
Jesse, your misgivings

1303
00:42:25,043 --> 00:42:29,172
have been duly noted.

1304
00:42:29,172 --> 00:42:31,424
Now move away from me.

1305
00:42:31,424 --> 00:42:34,010
No. This is

1306
00:42:31,424 --> 00:42:34,010
a voting thing.

1307
00:42:34,010 --> 00:42:36,929
I don't think so.

1308
00:42:34,010 --> 00:42:36,929
I vote it's a voting thing.

1309
00:42:36,929 --> 00:42:39,265
Mr. White,

1310
00:42:36,929 --> 00:42:39,265
weigh in here,

1311
00:42:36,929 --> 00:42:39,265
would you?

1312
00:42:39,265 --> 00:42:42,310
What do you think?

1313
00:42:42,310 --> 00:42:44,020
Mr. White?

1314
00:42:52,695 --> 00:42:56,574
The methylamine keeps flowing,

1315
00:42:52,695 --> 00:42:56,574
no matter what.

1316
00:42:56,574 --> 00:42:59,244
We are not ramping down.

1317
00:42:59,244 --> 00:43:02,330
We're just getting started.

1318
00:43:02,330 --> 00:43:06,000
Nothing stops this train.

1319
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,668
Nothing.

1320
00:43:09,962 --> 00:43:12,715
Hey, yo, Mr. White.

1321
00:43:09,962 --> 00:43:12,715
Hold up.

1322
00:43:14,633 --> 00:43:18,054
I just wanted to say

1323
00:43:14,633 --> 00:43:18,054
I liked your idea.

1324
00:43:18,054 --> 00:43:20,139
You know,

1325
00:43:18,054 --> 00:43:20,139
it's pretty, uh...

1326
00:43:21,224 --> 00:43:23,351
I think it's

1327
00:43:21,224 --> 00:43:23,351
the way to go.

1328
00:43:26,271 --> 00:43:28,940
Oh, hey, um,

1329
00:43:28,940 --> 00:43:32,068
you said it was your...

1330
00:43:28,940 --> 00:43:32,068
your birthday, so...

1331
00:43:35,071 --> 00:43:36,739
I left the receipt

1332
00:43:35,071 --> 00:43:36,739
in the box

1333
00:43:36,739 --> 00:43:38,533
in case you

1334
00:43:36,739 --> 00:43:38,533
wanna exchange it.

1335
00:43:40,659 --> 00:43:43,955
Anyway, hey,

1336
00:43:40,659 --> 00:43:43,955
happy birthday.

1337
00:43:59,095 --> 00:44:01,055
Hi.

1338
00:44:07,937 --> 00:44:11,608
I, uh, stopped by

1339
00:44:07,937 --> 00:44:11,608
Hank and Marie's.

1340
00:44:11,608 --> 00:44:15,570
Junior is still asking,

1341
00:44:11,608 --> 00:44:15,570
"What is going on?"

1342
00:44:15,570 --> 00:44:17,780
Nonstop, very insistently.

1343
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:19,031
[CHUCKLES]

1344
00:44:19,031 --> 00:44:20,992
But everything's okay.

1345
00:44:20,992 --> 00:44:24,036
They're watching

1346
00:44:20,992 --> 00:44:24,036
<i>Ratatouille.</i>

1347
00:44:24,036 --> 00:44:25,580
It's very sweet.

1348
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:29,375
How are you?

1349
00:44:37,342 --> 00:44:40,303
There's gonna be

1350
00:44:37,342 --> 00:44:40,303
some more money

1351
00:44:37,342 --> 00:44:40,303
coming in soon.

1352
00:44:40,303 --> 00:44:41,679
Is that okay?

1353
00:44:44,015 --> 00:44:45,350
Fine.

1354
00:44:45,350 --> 00:44:47,185
Good.

1355
00:44:50,062 --> 00:44:52,565
So...

1356
00:44:52,565 --> 00:44:54,192
Coming to bed?

1357
00:45:19,676 --> 00:45:21,678
I wanna

1358
00:45:19,676 --> 00:45:21,678
show you something.

See that watch?

00:45:26,432 --> 00:45:28,476
It's a birthday present.

1361
00:45:30,019 --> 00:45:32,647
The person who gave me

1362
00:45:30,019 --> 00:45:32,647
this present

1363
00:45:32,647 --> 00:45:35,732
wanted me dead too.

1364
00:45:35,732 --> 00:45:37,610
Not that long ago,

1365
00:45:37,610 --> 00:45:40,196
he pointed a gun

1366
00:45:37,610 --> 00:45:40,196
right between my eyes,

1367
00:45:40,196 --> 00:45:42,240
right here,

1368
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:44,534
and he threatened

1369
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:44,534
to kill me.

1370
00:45:46,202 --> 00:45:50,248
He changed his mind

1371
00:45:46,202 --> 00:45:50,248
about me, Skyler,

1372
00:45:50,248 --> 00:45:52,083
and so will you.

1373
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:14,188
[TICKING]

1374
00:46:31,456 --> 00:46:32,873
[TICKING LOUDLY]

1375
00:46:32,873 --> 00:46:34,709
[CLICKS]

1376
00:46:41,549 --> 00:46:43,760
