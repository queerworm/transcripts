And that's not the point.

1153
00:43:05,917 --> 00:43:08,794
The point is we're broke,

remember?

1155
00:43:08,794 --> 00:43:11,089
I'm waiting for your

unemployment check

1157
00:43:11,089 --> 00:43:13,132
so I can pay

1158
00:43:11,089 --> 00:43:13,132
the phone bill.

1159
00:43:13,132 --> 00:43:15,801
I asked for an extension

1160
00:43:13,132 --> 00:43:15,801
from the power company. Why?

1161
00:43:15,801 --> 00:43:17,803
Because on paper,

1162
00:43:15,801 --> 00:43:17,803
we have no money.

1163
00:43:17,803 --> 00:43:20,557
You are

1164
00:43:17,803 --> 00:43:20,557
completely overreacting.

1165
00:43:20,557 --> 00:43:24,936

1166
00:43:20,557 --> 00:43:24,936
to celebrate in some small way.

1168

to apologize, Walt.

1169
00:43:27,355 --> 00:43:29,315
I'm asking you to be smart.

1170
00:43:29,315 --> 00:43:32,318
I bought one bottle

1171
00:43:29,315 --> 00:43:32,318
of champagne.

1172
00:43:32,318 --> 00:43:35,654
One single bottle, Skyler.

1173
00:43:35,654 --> 00:43:38,032
I paid cash. That's it.

1174
00:43:38,032 --> 00:43:40,743
That's all it takes, okay?

1175
00:43:38,032 --> 00:43:40,743
I mean, look at Watergate.

No.

00:43:48,126 --> 00:43:51,296
the devil is in the details.
