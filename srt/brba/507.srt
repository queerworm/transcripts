1
00:00:24,107 --> 00:00:25,818
JESSE: There.

2
00:00:26,861 --> 00:00:28,988
That's them.

3
00:00:40,165 --> 00:00:42,501
(SIGHS)

4
00:00:40,165 --> 00:00:42,501
Your play, Walter.

5
00:00:42,501 --> 00:00:44,043
You're on your own.

6
00:00:58,851 --> 00:01:02,312
Looks like you're

7
00:00:58,851 --> 00:01:02,312
about 1,000 gallons

8
00:00:58,851 --> 00:01:02,312
light here, Mike.

9
00:01:02,312 --> 00:01:03,898
Where's the juice?

10
00:01:03,898 --> 00:01:06,692
The methylamine

11
00:01:03,898 --> 00:01:06,692
isn't coming.

12
00:01:08,652 --> 00:01:10,278
Why is that?

13
00:01:11,321 --> 00:01:12,990
And who the hell

14
00:01:11,321 --> 00:01:12,990
are you?

15
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:14,616
I'm the man

16
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:14,616
who's keeping it.

17
00:01:15,951 --> 00:01:17,411
What the hell's this?

18
00:01:17,411 --> 00:01:20,163
We had an agreement, right?

19
00:01:17,411 --> 00:01:20,163
We got our deal.

20
00:01:20,163 --> 00:01:21,456
So where's the tank, Mike?

21
00:01:21,456 --> 00:01:23,667
Mike doesn't know

22
00:01:21,456 --> 00:01:23,667
where it is.

23
00:01:23,667 --> 00:01:26,420
Only I do.

24
00:01:23,667 --> 00:01:26,420
And you're dealing

25
00:01:23,667 --> 00:01:26,420
with me now, not him.

26
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:28,380
Why don't you just cut

27
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:28,380
to what it is you want,

28
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:30,507
or what you think

29
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:30,507
is gonna happen here,

30
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:30,507
all right?

31
00:01:30,507 --> 00:01:33,510
'Cause we're gonna get

32
00:01:30,507 --> 00:01:33,510
what we came for.

33
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:36,764
That 1,000 gallons

34
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:36,764
of methylamine

35
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:36,764
is worth more in my hands

36
00:01:36,764 --> 00:01:39,725
than it is in yours

37
00:01:36,764 --> 00:01:39,725
or anyone else's,

38
00:01:36,764 --> 00:01:39,725
for that matter.

39
00:01:39,725 --> 00:01:42,603
But I need

40
00:01:39,725 --> 00:01:42,603
distribution.

41
00:01:42,603 --> 00:01:44,855
(CHUCKLES)

42
00:01:42,603 --> 00:01:44,855
Distribution.

43
00:01:44,855 --> 00:01:47,190
That's right.

44
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:50,778
So if you agree

45
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:50,778
to give up your cook

46
00:01:50,778 --> 00:01:53,655
and sell

47
00:01:50,778 --> 00:01:53,655
my product instead,

48
00:01:53,655 --> 00:01:55,908
I'll give you 35 percent

49
00:01:53,655 --> 00:01:55,908
of the take.

50
00:01:55,908 --> 00:01:58,535
35 percent? Wow.

51
00:01:58,535 --> 00:02:03,082
Are you kidding me?

52
00:01:58,535 --> 00:02:03,082
35... Mike, please

53
00:01:58,535 --> 00:02:03,082
tell me this is a joke.

54
00:02:03,082 --> 00:02:06,543
You know how far

55
00:02:03,082 --> 00:02:06,543
we had to stick our necks out

56
00:02:03,082 --> 00:02:06,543
to get our hands on this cash?

57
00:02:06,543 --> 00:02:08,420
And why the hell

58
00:02:06,543 --> 00:02:08,420
would we want you?

59
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:10,255
You realize we have

60
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:10,255
our own operation, right?

61
00:02:10,255 --> 00:02:13,216
I know all about

62
00:02:10,255 --> 00:02:13,216
your operation.

63
00:02:13,216 --> 00:02:16,428
My partners here tell me

64
00:02:13,216 --> 00:02:16,428
that you produce a meth

65
00:02:16,428 --> 00:02:19,807
that's 70 percent pure,

66
00:02:16,428 --> 00:02:19,807
if you're lucky.

67
00:02:19,807 --> 00:02:23,936
What I produce

68
00:02:19,807 --> 00:02:23,936
is 99.1 percent pure.

69
00:02:23,936 --> 00:02:25,729
So?

70
00:02:28,356 --> 00:02:32,903
So...it's grade school t-ball

71
00:02:32,903 --> 00:02:35,405
versus the New York Yankees.

72
00:02:35,405 --> 00:02:38,867
Yours is, uh,

73
00:02:35,405 --> 00:02:38,867
just some tepid,

74
00:02:38,867 --> 00:02:42,412
off-brand,

75
00:02:38,867 --> 00:02:42,412
generic cola.

76
00:02:42,412 --> 00:02:46,541
What I'm making

77
00:02:42,412 --> 00:02:46,541
is classic coke.

78
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:49,086
All right. Okay.

79
00:02:49,086 --> 00:02:50,963
So, um...

80
00:02:49,086 --> 00:02:50,963
(CLEARS THROAT)

81
00:02:50,963 --> 00:02:54,633
If we just waste you

82
00:02:50,963 --> 00:02:54,633
right here, right now,

83
00:02:54,633 --> 00:02:56,093
and leave you

84
00:02:54,633 --> 00:02:56,093
in the desert,

85
00:02:56,093 --> 00:02:58,428
then there is no more coke

86
00:02:56,093 --> 00:02:58,428
on the market, right?

87
00:02:58,428 --> 00:03:02,141
See how that works?

88
00:02:58,428 --> 00:03:02,141
There's only us.

89
00:03:02,141 --> 00:03:05,060
Do you really wanna live

90
00:03:02,141 --> 00:03:05,060
in a world without coca cola?

91
00:03:16,195 --> 00:03:18,323
My partner tells me

92
00:03:16,195 --> 00:03:18,323
that your crew

93
00:03:18,323 --> 00:03:21,451
switched to a P2Pcook

94
00:03:18,323 --> 00:03:21,451
because of our success.

95
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:24,038
You dye your meth

96
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:24,038
with food coloring

97
00:03:24,038 --> 00:03:25,622
to make it look like mine.

98
00:03:25,622 --> 00:03:29,084
You already ape my product

99
00:03:25,622 --> 00:03:29,084
at every turn.

100
00:03:30,169 --> 00:03:31,920
But now...

101
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,255
You have the opportunity

102
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,255
to sell it yourself.

103
00:03:34,255 --> 00:03:36,257
I need you

104
00:03:34,255 --> 00:03:36,257
to listen to me.

105
00:03:36,257 --> 00:03:38,259
We're not gonna

106
00:03:36,257 --> 00:03:38,259
give up this deal

107
00:03:38,259 --> 00:03:41,972
to be your errand boys,

108
00:03:38,259 --> 00:03:41,972
do you understand?

109
00:03:41,972 --> 00:03:43,849
For what?

110
00:03:43,849 --> 00:03:45,767
To watch a bunch of junkies

111
00:03:43,849 --> 00:03:45,767
get a better high?

112
00:03:45,767 --> 00:03:50,522
A better high

113
00:03:45,767 --> 00:03:50,522
means customers pay more.

114
00:03:50,522 --> 00:03:54,860
A higher purity

115
00:03:50,522 --> 00:03:54,860
means a greater yield.

116
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:57,946
That's 130 million dollars

117
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:57,946
of profit

118
00:03:57,946 --> 00:04:02,283
that isn't being pissed away

119
00:03:57,946 --> 00:04:02,283
by some substandard cook.

120
00:04:02,283 --> 00:04:04,953
Now you listen to me.

121
00:04:04,953 --> 00:04:06,997
You've got the greatest

122
00:04:04,953 --> 00:04:06,997
meth cook in a,

123
00:04:06,997 --> 00:04:08,373
no, the two

124
00:04:08,373 --> 00:04:11,585
greatest meth cooks

125
00:04:08,373 --> 00:04:11,585
in America right here,

126
00:04:11,585 --> 00:04:13,628
and with our skills,

127
00:04:13,628 --> 00:04:17,007
you'll earn more

128
00:04:13,628 --> 00:04:17,007
from that 35 percent

129
00:04:17,007 --> 00:04:18,967
than you ever would

130
00:04:17,007 --> 00:04:18,967
on your own.

131
00:04:18,967 --> 00:04:21,136
Yeah. So you say.

132
00:04:21,136 --> 00:04:23,972
Just wondering why

133
00:04:21,136 --> 00:04:23,972
we're so lucky.

134
00:04:23,972 --> 00:04:25,515
Why cut us in?

135
00:04:25,515 --> 00:04:28,351
Mike is retiring

136
00:04:25,515 --> 00:04:28,351
from our crew,

137
00:04:28,351 --> 00:04:31,354
so his share of

138
00:04:28,351 --> 00:04:31,354
the partnership

139
00:04:28,351 --> 00:04:31,354
is available,

140
00:04:31,354 --> 00:04:36,401
if you can handle

141
00:04:31,354 --> 00:04:36,401
his end... Distribution.

142
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:39,113
And if you give him

143
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:39,113
five million dollars

144
00:04:39,113 --> 00:04:40,781
of the 15 million

145
00:04:39,113 --> 00:04:40,781
that you brought today.

146
00:04:40,781 --> 00:04:42,991
Just think of it

147
00:04:40,781 --> 00:04:42,991
as a finder's fee

148
00:04:42,991 --> 00:04:45,119
for bringing us

149
00:04:42,991 --> 00:04:45,119
together.

150
00:04:45,119 --> 00:04:48,789
We have 40 pounds

151
00:04:45,119 --> 00:04:48,789
of product ready to ship,

152
00:04:48,789 --> 00:04:51,499
ready to go.

153
00:04:51,499 --> 00:04:53,210
Are you ready?

154
00:05:10,727 --> 00:05:13,230
(CHUCKLES)

155
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:16,024
Who the hell are ya?

156
00:05:16,024 --> 00:05:17,192
You know.

157
00:05:17,192 --> 00:05:21,071
You all know

158
00:05:17,192 --> 00:05:21,071
exactly who I am.

159
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:25,909
Say my name.

160
00:05:25,909 --> 00:05:28,078
Do what? I don't...

161
00:05:28,078 --> 00:05:29,704
I don't have a damn clue

162
00:05:28,078 --> 00:05:29,704
who the hell you are.

163
00:05:29,704 --> 00:05:32,791
Yeah, you do.

164
00:05:29,704 --> 00:05:32,791
I'm the cook.

165
00:05:34,584 --> 00:05:37,504
I'm the man

166
00:05:34,584 --> 00:05:37,504
who killed Gus Fring.

167
00:05:37,504 --> 00:05:40,715
Bullshit.

168
00:05:37,504 --> 00:05:40,715
Cartel got Fring.

169
00:05:40,715 --> 00:05:42,550
Are you sure?

170
00:05:52,144 --> 00:05:54,062
That's right.

171
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:58,025
Now, say my name.

172
00:06:03,613 --> 00:06:05,364
Heisenberg.

173
00:06:06,992 --> 00:06:09,368
You're goddamn right.

174
00:06:09,368 --> 00:06:11,621
(♪♪♪)

175
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:46,323
I gotta hand it to you,

176
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:46,323
Walter.

177
00:06:50,244 --> 00:06:52,079
Hey.

178
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:54,956
I appreciate

179
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:54,956
the kind words,

180
00:06:54,956 --> 00:06:58,877
but I'm out too,

181
00:06:54,956 --> 00:06:58,877
remember?

182
00:06:58,877 --> 00:07:01,296
I know.

183
00:06:58,877 --> 00:07:01,296
We'll talk.

184
00:07:03,882 --> 00:07:06,425
Maybe we should talk

185
00:07:03,882 --> 00:07:06,425
about how and when

186
00:07:06,425 --> 00:07:08,762
I'm gonna get

187
00:07:06,425 --> 00:07:08,762
my five million dollars.

188
00:07:08,762 --> 00:07:11,056
And we will do that.

189
00:07:11,056 --> 00:07:13,350
Absolutely.

190
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:14,642
It's just, you know...

191
00:07:14,642 --> 00:07:17,771
Jesse, just give me

192
00:07:14,642 --> 00:07:17,771
some time here, okay?

193
00:07:17,771 --> 00:07:20,690
I'll need a little help

194
00:07:17,771 --> 00:07:20,690
getting things up and running

195
00:07:17,771 --> 00:07:20,690
during this transition.

196
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:22,483
You can at least

197
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:22,483
do that for me, right?

198

squander that potential?

505
00:20:27,351 --> 00:20:30,813

516
00:20:41,782 --> 00:20:44,911
what then? Huh?

517
00:20:44,911 --> 00:20:47,621

00:21:06,348 --> 00:21:09,435
to me? Jesus!

529
00:21:09,435 --> 00:21:11,938

530
00:21:09,435 --> 00:21:11,938
who's the father here.

531
00:21:11,938 --> 00:21:15,315

in a ball in tears

533
00:21:11,938 --> 00:21:15,315

534
00:21:15,315 --> 00:21:17,317
Do I have to lock myself

535
00:21:15,315 --> 00:21:17,317
away in a room

536
00:21:17,317 --> 00:21:19,237
and get high

537
00:21:17,317 --> 00:21:19,237
to prove it to you?

538
00:21:19,237 --> 00:21:22,073
What happened to that boy

539
00:21:19,237 --> 00:21:22,073
is a tragedy,

540
00:21:22,073 --> 00:21:24,324
and it tears me up inside!

541
00:21:24,324 --> 00:21:26,452
But because

542
00:21:24,324 --> 00:21:26,452
it happened, what,

543
00:21:26,452 --> 00:21:30,664
am I supposed

544
00:21:26,452 --> 00:21:30,664
to just lie down

545
00:21:26,452 --> 00:21:30,664
and die with him?

00:21:30,664 --> 00:21:32,041

547
00:21:32,041 --> 00:21:33,584

that it happened,

549
00:21:33,584 --> 00:21:36,879

Yeah.

555
00:21:43,761 --> 00:21:45,638
All the people

556
00:21:43,761 --> 00:21:45,638
that we've killed...

00:21:45,638 --> 00:21:49,308
Gale and the rest...

559
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:51,185
that there's a hell...

560
00:21:51,185 --> 00:21:54,188

561
00:21:51,185 --> 00:21:54,188
if you're into that.

562
00:21:51,185 --> 00:21:54,188
But we're...

563
00:21:54,188 --> 00:21:57,066
We're already pretty much

564
00:21:54,188 --> 00:21:57,066
going there, right?

565
00:21:57,066 --> 00:22:00,027
But I'm not gonna lie down

566
00:21:57,066 --> 00:22:00,027
until I get there.

567
00:22:00,027 --> 00:22:03,281
What, just because

568
00:22:00,027 --> 00:22:03,281
I don't wanna cook

569
00:22:00,027 --> 00:22:03,281

570
00:22:03,281 --> 00:22:05,158

571
00:22:05,158 --> 00:22:07,160

572
00:22:05,158 --> 00:22:07,160

573
00:22:05,158 --> 00:22:07,160

574
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:09,996
No one. None.

575
00:22:09,996 --> 00:22:12,248
Now that we're in control,

576
00:22:09,996 --> 00:22:12,248
no one else gets hurt.

577
00:22:12,248 --> 00:22:15,835
You keep saying that,

578
00:22:12,248 --> 00:22:15,835
and it's bullshit every time!

579
00:22:15,835 --> 00:22:18,420
No.

580
00:22:15,835 --> 00:22:18,420
Always! You know what?

581
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:21,799
I'm done, okay?

582
00:22:21,799 --> 00:22:26,304
You just

583
00:22:21,799 --> 00:22:26,304
give me my money,

584
00:22:21,799 --> 00:22:26,304
and you and I,

585
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:27,763
we're done.

586
00:22:30,474 --> 00:22:33,686
Hmm. Okay.

587
00:22:35,353 --> 00:22:36,689
Why?

588
00:22:38,316 --> 00:22:42,153
Why do you want

589
00:22:38,316 --> 00:22:42,153
this money?

590
00:22:42,153 --> 00:22:46,240
Because it's mine.

591
00:22:42,153 --> 00:22:46,240
It's my cut.

592
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,701
But isn't it filthy

593
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,701
blood money?

594
00:22:48,701 --> 00:22:52,330
I mean, you're so pure.

595
00:22:48,701 --> 00:22:52,330
You have such emotional depth.

596
00:22:52,330 --> 00:22:55,124
No, no, no, no.

597
00:22:52,330 --> 00:22:55,124
You shouldn't touch

598
00:22:52,330 --> 00:22:55,124
that dirty money.

599
00:22:55,124 --> 00:22:57,668
I'll save you

600
00:22:55,124 --> 00:22:57,668
from that, Jesse.

601
00:22:58,836 --> 00:23:01,005
Come on.

602
00:23:01,005 --> 00:23:02,298
You want it.

603
00:23:02,298 --> 00:23:04,800
You want it just as much

604
00:23:02,298 --> 00:23:04,800
as I want it.

605
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:09,305
And it's not wrong

606
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:09,305
to want it. Okay?

607
00:23:09,305 --> 00:23:13,184
So stay

608
00:23:09,305 --> 00:23:13,184
and work with me,

609
00:23:13,184 --> 00:23:16,478
and you can make ten,

610
00:23:13,184 --> 00:23:16,478
20 times as much.

611
00:23:20,607 --> 00:23:23,652
Whatever, man.

612
00:23:23,652 --> 00:23:26,906
You don't wanna pay me,

613
00:23:23,652 --> 00:23:26,906
I don't care.

614
00:23:26,906 --> 00:23:28,199
Yes, you do.

615
00:23:28,199 --> 00:23:30,868
It's on you,

616
00:23:28,199 --> 00:23:30,868
all right?

617
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:34,121
I'm done.

618
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:34,121
No, you're not.

619
00:23:34,121 --> 00:23:36,665
You're not done.

620
00:23:34,121 --> 00:23:36,665
You're not leaving,

621
00:23:36,665 --> 00:23:39,085
because if you leave,

622
00:23:36,665 --> 00:23:39,085
you get nothing!

623
00:23:39,085 --> 00:23:42,713
Do you understand me?

624
00:23:39,085 --> 00:23:42,713
Nothing!

625
00:23:42,713 --> 00:23:44,882
Jesse!

626
00:23:47,718 --> 00:23:51,055

661

662
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:52,116
Yes, sir.

663
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:52,116
<i>I know how good you are.</i>

664
00:24:52,116 --> 00:24:54,994

00:24:59,915 --> 00:25:01,834
<i>with responsibilities.</i>

673
00:25:01,834 --> 00:25:04,128
<i>I mean, Hank,</i>

674
00:25:01,834 --> 00:25:04,128
<i>basic reports</i>

<i>in a timely manner.</i>

677
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:08,757
I'll work on it.

678
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:08,757
It'll get better.

679
00:25:08,757 --> 00:25:11,218
<i>Yeah, it will,</i>

680
00:25:08,757 --> 00:25:11,218
<i>because way too much</i>

681
00:25:08,757 --> 00:25:11,218
<i>time and money</i>

682
00:25:11,218 --> 00:25:12,761
<i>is being spent</i>

<i>on the Fring case,</i>

684
00:25:12,761 --> 00:25:15,097
<i>a case which is</i>

685
00:25:12,761 --> 00:25:15,097
<i>essentially over.</i>

686
00:25:15,097 --> 00:25:18,516
<i>All this overtime</i>

687
00:25:15,097 --> 00:25:18,516
<i>to surveil</i>

688
00:25:15,097 --> 00:25:18,516
<i>Michael Ehrmantraut?</i>

689
00:25:18,516 --> 00:25:21,061
<i>That's just money that could</i>

690
00:25:18,516 --> 00:25:21,061
<i>be better spent elsewhere.</i>

691
00:25:21,061 --> 00:25:22,480
I understand,

692
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,398
but I'm not making

693
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,398
these choices lightly.

694
00:25:24,398 --> 00:25:26,817
We've got increased reports

695
00:25:24,398 --> 00:25:26,817
of blue meth on the street,

696
00:25:26,817 --> 00:25:29,736
Fring's gang

697
00:25:26,817 --> 00:25:29,736
is still operational,

698
00:25:26,817 --> 00:25:29,736
and Ehrmantraut is involved.

699
00:25:29,736 --> 00:25:30,904
It's that simple.

700
00:25:30,904 --> 00:25:32,781
<i>I believe you.</i>

701
00:25:30,904 --> 00:25:32,781
<i>But so what?</i>

702
00:25:32,781 --> 00:25:35,159
<i>It's one case</i>

703
00:25:32,781 --> 00:25:35,159
<i>out of dozens,</i>

704
00:25:35,159 --> 00:25:37,828
<i>and you don't play favorites</i>

705
00:25:35,159 --> 00:25:37,828
<i>with it just because</i>

706
00:25:35,159 --> 00:25:37,828
<i>it used to be yours.</i>

707
00:25:37,828 --> 00:25:39,705
I really think that...

708
00:25:37,828 --> 00:25:39,705
<i>Don't play favorites</i>

709
00:25:37,828 --> 00:25:39,705
<i>with it, Hank.</i>

710
00:25:39,705 --> 00:25:41,165
<i>You got a bigger</i>

711
00:25:39,705 --> 00:25:41,165
<i>job than that.</i>

712
00:25:41,165 --> 00:25:43,667
<i>I mean,</i>

713
00:25:41,165 --> 00:25:43,667
<i>forget the financial cost.</i>

714
00:25:43,667 --> 00:25:47,004
<i>I hear you're personally</i>

715
00:25:43,667 --> 00:25:47,004
<i>serving search warrants</i>

716
00:25:43,667 --> 00:25:47,004
<i>out in the field?</i>

717
00:25:47,004 --> 00:25:48,881
That was an error

718
00:25:47,004 --> 00:25:48,881
in judgment.

719
00:25:48,881 --> 00:25:50,590
Won't happen again.

720
00:25:48,881 --> 00:25:50,590
<i>You're damn right it won't.</i>

721
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:52,592
<i>I'm just gonna bottom line</i>

722
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:52,592
<i>this for you.</i>

723
00:25:52,592 --> 00:25:55,179
<i>The surveillance budget</i>

724
00:25:52,592 --> 00:25:55,179
<i>for Ehrmantraut is now zero.</i>

725
00:25:55,179 --> 00:25:56,554
<i>We clear?</i>

726
00:25:57,848 --> 00:26:00,518
Sure. Thank you.

727
00:26:00,518 --> 00:26:02,811
Clear.

728
00:26:00,518 --> 00:26:02,811
<i>Good.</i>

729
00:26:02,811 --> 00:26:04,480
<i>We'll be in touch.</i>

730
00:26:14,156 --> 00:26:17,117
(KNOCKING)

731
00:26:14,156 --> 00:26:17,117
Yeah?

732
00:26:18,327 --> 00:26:19,745
Hey.

733
00:26:25,792 --> 00:26:28,586
So, Ramey wanted

734
00:26:25,792 --> 00:26:28,586
to catch up with you?

735
00:26:28,586 --> 00:26:31,173
Talk sports and stuff,

736
00:26:28,586 --> 00:26:31,173
I guess?

737
00:26:31,173 --> 00:26:32,508
Yeah.

738
00:26:31,173 --> 00:26:32,508
Something like that.

739
00:26:32,508 --> 00:26:35,593
No more

740
00:26:32,508 --> 00:26:35,593
following Ehrmantraut.

741
00:26:35,593 --> 00:26:39,014
Not worth

742
00:26:35,593 --> 00:26:39,014
the financial investment.

743
00:26:39,014 --> 00:26:41,141
Well, it's not like

744
00:26:39,014 --> 00:26:41,141
the guy's going anywhere.

745
00:26:41,141 --> 00:26:43,769
He's not even bothering

746
00:26:41,141 --> 00:26:43,769
to throw our tails anymore.

747
00:26:43,769 --> 00:26:45,645
He's just living

748
00:26:43,769 --> 00:26:45,645
a boring old-man life

749
00:26:45,645 --> 00:26:48,690
like he has nothing left

750
00:26:45,645 --> 00:26:48,690
to hide.

751
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:50,526
And none of Fring's crew

752
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:50,526
is talking?

753
00:26:50,526 --> 00:26:52,111
Not giving an inch.

754
00:26:52,111 --> 00:26:54,321
You sweeten

755
00:26:52,111 --> 00:26:54,321
the pot enough?

756
00:26:54,321 --> 00:26:57,324
Zero jail time

757
00:26:54,321 --> 00:26:57,324
and an all-expense-paid

758
00:26:54,321 --> 00:26:57,324
trip to Maui?

759
00:26:57,324 --> 00:27:00,869
(CHUCKLES)

760
00:26:57,324 --> 00:27:00,869
Not that, but close.

761
00:26:57,324 --> 00:27:00,869
Nobody wants to bite.

762
00:27:00,869 --> 00:27:02,413
Christ!

763
00:27:02,413 --> 00:27:04,706
They're either the most

764
00:27:02,413 --> 00:27:04,706
loyal crew in history,

765
00:27:04,706 --> 00:27:06,166
or someone's

766
00:27:04,706 --> 00:27:06,166
still paying them off.

767
00:27:06,166 --> 00:27:07,501
You still checking

768
00:27:06,166 --> 00:27:07,501
bank records?

769
00:27:07,501 --> 00:27:09,211
No one living

770
00:27:07,501 --> 00:27:09,211
beyond their means.

771
00:27:09,211 --> 00:27:11,547
Nine perps...

772
00:27:11,547 --> 00:27:13,340
All being represented

773
00:27:11,547 --> 00:27:13,340
by one lawyer.

774
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:15,593
Not unusual

775
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:15,593
in a case like this.

776
00:27:15,593 --> 00:27:16,927

All of this,

1161
00:42:39,391 --> 00:42:43,811
falling apart like this,

1162
00:42:39,391 --> 00:42:43,811
is on you.

1163
00:42:43,811 --> 00:42:45,271
Wow.

1164
00:42:45,271 --> 00:42:47,065
(LAUGHS) Wow!

1165
00:42:47,065 --> 00:42:50,693
Oh, that's some

1166
00:42:47,065 --> 00:42:50,693
kind of logic

1167
00:42:47,065 --> 00:42:50,693
right there, Mike.

1168
00:42:50,693 --> 00:42:53,738
You screw up,

1169
00:42:50,693 --> 00:42:53,738
get yourself followed

1170
00:42:50,693 --> 00:42:53,738
by the DEA,

1171
00:42:53,738 --> 00:42:55,823
and now, suddenly,

1172
00:42:53,738 --> 00:42:55,823
this is all my fault?

1173
00:42:55,823 --> 00:42:57,867
Why don't you walk me

1174
00:42:55,823 --> 00:42:57,867
through this, Mike?

1175
00:42:57,867 --> 00:43:00,703
We had a good thing,

1176
00:42:57,867 --> 00:43:00,703
you stupid son of a bitch!

1177
00:43:00,703 --> 00:43:03,039
We had Fring.

1178
00:43:00,703 --> 00:43:03,039
We had a lab.

1179
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:05,791
We had everything we needed,

1180
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:05,791
and it all ran

1181
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:05,791
like clockwork.

1182
00:43:05,791 --> 00:43:08,086
Oh, my God.

1183
00:43:05,791 --> 00:43:08,086
You could've

1184
00:43:05,791 --> 00:43:08,086
shut your mouth,

1185
00:43:08,086 --> 00:43:11,214
cooked, and made

1186
00:43:08,086 --> 00:43:11,214
as much money

1187
00:43:08,086 --> 00:43:11,214
as you ever needed.

1188
00:43:11,214 --> 00:43:14,967
It was perfect.

1189
00:43:11,214 --> 00:43:14,967
But, no, you just

1190
00:43:11,214 --> 00:43:14,967
had to blow it up.

1191
00:43:14,967 --> 00:43:17,554
You and your pride

1192
00:43:14,967 --> 00:43:17,554
and your ego!

1193
00:43:17,554 --> 00:43:19,764
You just had to be the man.

1194
00:43:19,764 --> 00:43:22,517
If you'd done your job,

1195
00:43:19,764 --> 00:43:22,517
known your place,

1196
00:43:22,517 --> 00:43:24,769
we'd all be fine

1197
00:43:22,517 --> 00:43:24,769
right now!

I just...

1203
00:45:41,322 --> 00:45:43,366
I just realized

1204
00:45:41,322 --> 00:45:43,366
that Lydia has the names.

1205
00:45:43,366 --> 00:45:45,326
I can get them

1206
00:45:43,366 --> 00:45:45,326
from her.

1207
00:45:50,248 --> 00:45:52,500
I'm sorry, Mike.

1208
00:45:53,959 --> 00:45:57,338
This... This whole thing

1209
00:45:53,959 --> 00:45:57,338
could've been avoided.

1210
00:45:57,338 --> 00:45:59,382
Shut the fuck up.

1211
00:46:02,427 --> 00:46:04,303
Let me die in peace.
