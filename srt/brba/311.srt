Yeah.

772
00:29:47,536 --> 00:29:49,913
Thanks.

773
00:29:49,913 --> 00:29:51,915
What time is it?

774
00:29:53,459 --> 00:29:55,461
Early still.

775
00:29:58,838 --> 00:30:00,633

What?

778
00:30:05,845 --> 00:30:09,308
Thought maybe if you're holding,

779
00:30:09,308 --> 00:30:11,560
we can do something.

780
00:30:12,645 --> 00:30:14,605

781
00:30:14,605 --> 00:30:18,776
You know, that blue stuff

782
00:30:14,605 --> 00:30:18,776
you were talking about.

783
00:30:18,776 --> 00:30:20,444
Maybe you had a line on some?

784
00:30:20,444 --> 00:30:21,737
Wait.

785
00:30:21,737 --> 00:30:25,991
Whoa. What?

786
00:30:25,991 --> 00:30:28,619

00:30:25,991 --> 00:30:28,619

788
00:30:28,619 --> 00:30:31,830

You're the one who

You heard me.

you've been through.

This whole neighborhood's

835
00:32:09,678 --> 00:32:13,265
run by gangs.

836
00:32:13,265 --> 00:32:16,935
They run the drugs,

00:32:13,265 --> 00:32:16,935
control the streets.

838
00:32:19,229 --> 00:32:22,608
They sort of took Tomas in.

839
00:32:24,025 --> 00:32:25,360
No dad around.

840
00:32:26,486 --> 00:32:29,281
Eight years old,

841
00:32:29,281 --> 00:32:32,200
they got Tomas slinging.

842
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:34,327
Part of some crew.

843
00:32:36,037 --> 00:32:39,416
Then when he was 10,

844
00:32:39,416 --> 00:32:43,462
for some initiation

845
00:32:39,416 --> 00:32:43,462
or something,

846
00:32:45,130 --> 00:32:47,048
they made him kill somebody.

847
00:32:49,802 --> 00:32:53,972
I heard the rumors.

848
00:32:49,802 --> 00:32:53,972
I didn't believe it at first.

849
00:32:56,224 --> 00:32:58,936
But then I saw him

850
00:32:56,224 --> 00:32:58,936
like a week later.

851
00:33:02,188 --> 00:33:05,818
And he told me,

852
00:33:02,188 --> 00:33:05,818
yeah, he did it.

853
00:33:07,611 --> 00:33:10,739
They gave Tomas a gun.

854
00:33:10,739 --> 00:33:13,283
Gave him a choice.

855
00:33:13,283 --> 00:33:15,953
Him or some dude.

856
00:33:17,287 --> 00:33:19,247
So he did it.

857
00:33:20,791 --> 00:33:23,669
Told me all about it

858
00:33:20,791 --> 00:33:23,669
like it was nothing.

859
00:33:24,795 --> 00:33:28,173
Who did he say he killed?

00:33:28,173 --> 00:33:30,258

861
00:33:32,636 --> 00:33:34,721

00:33:34,721 --> 00:33:39,559
from here, over off of Central.

864
00:33:41,979 --> 00:33:45,565
Just rode up on his bike

865
00:33:41,979 --> 00:33:45,565
and shot him.

866
00:33:49,277 --> 00:33:51,488
Off of Central?

867
00:33:52,698 --> 00:33:55,701
Like over by

868
00:33:52,698 --> 00:33:55,701

00:33:57,536 --> 00:33:59,538

Few months back.

00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:09,381
What else did he tell you?

872
00:34:14,302 --> 00:34:17,096
He shot the guy

873
00:34:14,302 --> 00:34:17,096
right through the neck.

874
00:34:18,223 --> 00:34:20,392
Shot him dead.

875
00:34:23,478 --> 00:34:26,732
Just because he was working

00:34:23,478 --> 00:34:26,732

880
00:34:57,303 --> 00:34:58,597
People who say "guess what"

881
00:34:58,597 --> 00:35:01,349
and then actually expect you

882
00:34:58,597 --> 00:35:01,349
to guess,

883
00:35:01,349 --> 00:35:03,309
I hate those people.

884
00:35:03,309 --> 00:35:05,144
Well, I just heard

885
00:35:05,144 --> 00:35:10,108
about a certain patient

886
00:35:05,144 --> 00:35:10,108

Isn't that fantastic?

890
00:35:17,574 --> 00:35:20,201
They plan on rolling me

891
00:35:17,574 --> 00:35:20,201
out the front door?

892
00:35:20,201 --> 00:35:23,538
Or put me on a greased plank

893
00:35:20,201 --> 00:35:23,538
and slide me out the window?

894
00:35:23,538 --> 00:35:25,290
Hey.

895
00:35:25,290 --> 00:35:27,459
Because I don't care

896
00:35:25,290 --> 00:35:27,459
what any damned

897
00:35:27,459 --> 00:35:29,168

898
00:35:29,168 --> 00:35:31,337
I'm not leaving here

00:35:31,337 --> 00:35:33,882
Hank, this isn't

901
00:35:31,337 --> 00:35:33,882
about insurance.

902
00:35:33,882 --> 00:35:35,383
I've talked to everybody,

903
00:35:35,383 --> 00:35:38,553
and they all say you are

904
00:35:35,383 --> 00:35:38,553
healthy enough to go home.

905
00:35:38,553 --> 00:35:40,472
Oh, I'm healthy enough, huh?

906
00:35:38,553 --> 00:35:40,472
Yeah.

907
00:35:40,472 --> 00:35:42,432
Hank, you get

908
00:35:40,472 --> 00:35:42,432
stronger every day.

909
00:35:42,432 --> 00:35:44,559
You don't need

910
00:35:42,432 --> 00:35:44,559
to be in a hospital.

911
00:35:44,559 --> 00:35:47,896
In this condition,

912
00:35:44,559 --> 00:35:47,896
yeah, I do.

913
00:35:47,896 --> 00:35:50,983
You'll be just as comfortable

914
00:35:47,896 --> 00:35:50,983
at home as you are here.

915
00:35:50,983 --> 00:35:52,943
You'll have

916
00:35:50,983 --> 00:35:52,943
all the same equipment.

917
00:35:52,943 --> 00:35:54,987
Same equipment?

918
00:35:52,943 --> 00:35:54,987
What's that mean?

919
00:35:54,987 --> 00:35:56,947
The equipment

920
00:35:54,987 --> 00:35:56,947
that you have here,

921
00:35:56,947 --> 00:35:58,991
that you need.

922
00:35:56,947 --> 00:35:58,991
Short-term.

923
00:35:58,991 --> 00:36:02,452
You'll do your PT at home,

00:35:58,991 --> 00:36:02,452
and it'll be great

00:36:02,452 --> 00:36:05,330

00:36:08,959 --> 00:36:11,169
you always wanted it.

00:36:11,169 --> 00:36:13,880

shot to get it, right?

932
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:15,799
I got you a new bed--

00:36:15,799 --> 00:36:17,550

00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:19,427
Well--

935
00:36:19,427 --> 00:36:22,555
You put a hospital bed

936
00:36:19,427 --> 00:36:22,555
in my bedroom?

937
00:36:22,555 --> 00:36:24,516
Hank,

938
00:36:24,516 --> 00:36:26,101
you'll be home.

939
00:36:26,101 --> 00:36:29,270
You get that out of my house.

00:36:29,270 --> 00:36:31,523

941
00:36:31,523 --> 00:36:33,066

Hank--

943
00:36:34,151 --> 00:36:36,611
I leave this hospital,

944
00:36:36,611 --> 00:36:40,615
when I walk out of here.

945
00:36:36,611 --> 00:36:40,615
You understand?

946
00:36:41,783 --> 00:36:44,452
And not before.

Wha--? What's a Danny?

949
00:36:49,041 --> 00:36:50,959
Danny's an accomplice.

950
00:36:50,959 --> 00:36:55,922
Someone who's in on the scheme,

951
00:36:50,959 --> 00:36:55,922
who knows about laundering,

Now, while I agree with you

955
00:36:59,759 --> 00:37:03,722
that laser tag is a hard sell,
