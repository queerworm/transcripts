July 18th, 1992.

600
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:52,124
I was high on cocaine

601
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:52,124
and I was drunk.

602
00:29:52,124 --> 00:29:54,834
Cocaine wasn't an issue

603
00:29:52,124 --> 00:29:54,834
because I had bought myself

604
00:29:54,834 --> 00:29:58,213
two grams as a birthday present.

605
00:29:54,834 --> 00:29:58,213
I had plenty left.

606
00:29:58,213 --> 00:30:01,007
But I was out of vodka.

in the supermarkets,

611
00:30:06,597 --> 00:30:08,557
they have these ABC stores,

612
00:30:08,557 --> 00:30:15,105
which close at 5 p.m.,

613
00:30:08,557 --> 00:30:15,105

00:30:15,105 --> 00:30:18,776

615

00:30:18,776 --> 00:30:22,780

00:30:33,499 --> 00:30:37,043
so I jump in my truck.
