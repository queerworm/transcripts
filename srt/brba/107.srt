206

211
00:06:16,375 --> 00:06:20,588
I mean, the whole damn house

212
00:06:16,375 --> 00:06:20,588
has gotta be haunted by now.

215
00:06:28,555 --> 00:06:33,143
That is 17,500.

216
00:06:28,555 --> 00:06:33,143
Your half of the 35,000.

217

It's all yours.

Yeah.

So Tuco gave you this,

225
00:06:43,402 --> 00:06:44,821

You see what he did to me?

231
00:06:51,786 --> 00:06:54,206
Because I think

232
00:06:54,206 --> 00:06:55,832
that we can do

233
00:06:54,206 --> 00:06:55,832
