keeps an eye on her

100
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:31,855
when I'm not, so...

101
00:04:31,855 --> 00:04:33,774

392
00:12:18,446 --> 00:12:21,908
<i>All right. Thanks.</i>

393
00:12:21,908 --> 00:12:24,285
I know what you're thinking,

394
00:12:21,908 --> 00:12:24,285
but I didn't do it.

395
00:12:24,285 --> 00:12:26,329
I'm telling you,

396
00:12:24,285 --> 00:12:26,329
I didn't plant that thing.

397
00:12:26,329 --> 00:12:28,164
Shut up.

398
00:12:28,164 --> 00:12:29,957
And there you have it,

399
00:12:28,164 --> 00:12:29,957
like I said.

400
00:12:29,957 --> 00:12:32,001
All right.

401
00:12:29,957 --> 00:12:32,001
So now what?

402
00:12:32,001 --> 00:12:33,794
It's not the DEA's,

403
00:12:33,794 --> 00:12:36,089
so Schrader's

404
00:12:33,794 --> 00:12:36,089
probably thinking

405
00:12:33,794 --> 00:12:36,089
some crew planted it,

406
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:38,425
looking for

407
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:38,425
a weak spot

408
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:38,425
to pull a heist.

409
00:12:38,425 --> 00:12:41,094
He's gonna send a team

410
00:12:38,425 --> 00:12:41,094
over to that warehouse.

411
00:12:41,094 --> 00:12:42,596
He's gonna wire it

412
00:12:41,094 --> 00:12:42,596
out the wazoo.

413
00:12:42,596 --> 00:12:44,347
Bugs, cameras,

414
00:12:42,596 --> 00:12:44,347
the whole nine yards.

415
00:12:44,347 --> 00:12:46,683
So the warehouse

416
00:12:44,347 --> 00:12:46,683
is too hot.

417
00:12:46,683 --> 00:12:49,060
Her supply

418
00:12:46,683 --> 00:12:49,060
is useless to us now.

419
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:52,564
It depends on

420
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:52,564
how fast Schrader can

421
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:52,564
get his guys there.

422
00:12:52,564 --> 00:12:54,857
We're 900 miles closer,

423
00:12:52,564 --> 00:12:54,857
after all.

424
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:58,236
I say we keep listening,

425
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:58,236
suss out how much

426
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:58,236
time we have.

427
00:12:58,236 --> 00:13:00,863
If it's at least 12 hours,

428
00:12:58,236 --> 00:13:00,863
then we head down there,

429
00:13:00,863 --> 00:13:02,823
use her security code

430
00:13:00,863 --> 00:13:02,823
to gain access,

431
00:13:02,823 --> 00:13:04,825
and we take every barrel

432
00:13:02,823 --> 00:13:04,825
we can get our hands on.

433
00:13:04,825 --> 00:13:06,953
U-haul can only take

434
00:13:04,825 --> 00:13:06,953
six or seven

435
00:13:06,953 --> 00:13:08,663
before the suspension

436
00:13:06,953 --> 00:13:08,663
gives out.

437
00:13:08,663 --> 00:13:10,123
It's a stopgap.

438
00:13:10,123 --> 00:13:11,958
But right now,

439
00:13:10,123 --> 00:13:11,958
it's the best we can do.

440
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:16,463
(WHISPERING)

441
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:16,463
Well, what about her?

442
00:13:16,463 --> 00:13:19,798
MIKE: (SIGHS)

443
00:13:16,463 --> 00:13:19,798
You two drive

444
00:13:19,798 --> 00:13:21,800
the barrels

445
00:13:19,798 --> 00:13:21,800
back tonight.

446
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:24,471
I'll deal with her.

447
00:13:24,471 --> 00:13:27,474
No! No, no, no.

448
00:13:24,471 --> 00:13:27,474
You're making a mistake.

449
00:13:27,474 --> 00:13:30,477
This... This was not me!

450
00:13:27,474 --> 00:13:30,477
I swear to god I didn't do it!

451
00:13:30,477 --> 00:13:32,895
I don't know, man.

452
00:13:30,477 --> 00:13:32,895
It sounds like she's

453
00:13:30,477 --> 00:13:32,895
telling the truth to me.

454
00:13:32,895 --> 00:13:36,274
She has a gun

455
00:13:32,895 --> 00:13:36,274
to her head, kid.

456
00:13:36,274 --> 00:13:38,985
Everyone sounds

457
00:13:36,274 --> 00:13:38,985
like Meryl Streep

458
00:13:36,274 --> 00:13:38,985
with a gun to their head.

459
00:13:38,985 --> 00:13:41,321
I'm sorry, Jesse.

460
00:13:41,321 --> 00:13:44,491
You're the one who wanted

461
00:13:41,321 --> 00:13:44,491
to put it up to a vote.

462
00:13:44,491 --> 00:13:46,576
It's two against one.

463
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:50,705
No. No!

464
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:50,705
You can't kill me!

465
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:50,705
Come on!

466
00:13:50,705 --> 00:13:52,957
I swear

467
00:13:50,705 --> 00:13:52,957
I didn't do anything!

468
00:13:52,957 --> 00:13:56,210
HANK:<i> Hey, Janice,</i>

469
00:13:52,957 --> 00:13:56,210
<i>give me Doughty in the</i>

470
00:13:52,957 --> 00:13:56,210
<i>Houston office, will you?</i>

471
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:57,920
JANICE:<i> You got it.</i>

472
00:14:05,928 --> 00:14:07,681
<i>He's on the line.</i>

473
00:14:07,681 --> 00:14:09,265
HANK:<i> Hey, Erol.</i>

474
00:14:07,681 --> 00:14:09,265
<i>Please tell me you guys</i>

475
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:11,392
<i>didn't do something</i>

476
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:11,392

477
00:14:11,392 --> 00:14:13,144
<i>as put a GPS tracker</i>

478
00:14:11,392 --> 00:14:13,144
<i>on the outside</i>

479
00:14:13,144 --> 00:14:15,021
<i>of a barrel</i>

480
00:14:13,144 --> 00:14:15,021
<i>of methylamine.</i>

481
00:14:15,021 --> 00:14:18,316
<i>One earmarked</i>

482
00:14:15,021 --> 00:14:18,316
<i>for the Madrigal warehouse</i>

483
00:14:15,021 --> 00:14:18,316
<i>in Houston?</i>

484
00:14:18,316 --> 00:14:20,568
EROL:<i> Uh, who's asking?</i>

485
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:21,778
<i>Did someone find them?</i>

486
00:14:21,778 --> 00:14:23,904
<i>Jesus.</i>

487
00:14:21,778 --> 00:14:23,904
<i>Are you shitting me?</i>

488
00:14:23,904 --> 00:14:26,491
<i>Since when do you</i>

489
00:14:23,904 --> 00:14:26,491
<i>put a GPS tracker</i>

490
00:14:23,904 --> 00:14:26,491
<i>on the outside of a barrel?</i>

491
00:14:26,491 --> 00:14:28,743
<i>We didn't have</i>

492
00:14:26,491 --> 00:14:28,743
<i>time to go in there</i>

493
00:14:26,491 --> 00:14:28,743
<i>with hazard suits, Hank.</i>

494
00:14:28,743 --> 00:14:30,411
<i>They were about to ship.</i>

495
00:14:30,411 --> 00:14:32,831
<i>We epoxied them</i>

496
00:14:30,411 --> 00:14:32,831
<i>to the bottom.</i>

497
00:14:30,411 --> 00:14:32,831
<i>They were well-hidden.</i>

498
00:14:32,831 --> 00:14:35,583
<i>Oh, really? Well,</i>

499
00:14:32,831 --> 00:14:35,583
<i>not well-hidden enough.</i>

500
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:37,669
<i>How many barrels you tag?</i>

501
00:14:37,669 --> 00:14:41,088
<i>All of them.</i>

502
00:14:37,669 --> 00:14:41,088
<i>All the ones that were headed</i>

503
00:14:37,669 --> 00:14:41,088
<i>to the warehouse, anyway.</i>

504
00:14:41,088 --> 00:14:43,090
<i>Christ. All right.</i>

505
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:45,009
<i>Well, sit tight.</i>

506
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:45,009
<i>Let me figure out</i>

507
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:45,009
<i>how to play this.</i>

508
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:47,887
<i>Next time, a little</i>

509
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:47,887
<i>communication first,</i>

510
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:47,887
<i>all right?</i>

511
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:49,430
<i>Yeah, I...</i>

512
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:49,430
<i>I'm sorry about that.</i>

513
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:50,931
Asshole.

514
00:14:54,227 --> 00:14:57,731
(WHISPERING) Aside...

515
00:14:54,227 --> 00:14:57,731
Aside from the fact

516
00:14:57,731 --> 00:14:59,440
that we almost

517
00:14:57,731 --> 00:14:59,440
killed this woman,

518
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:02,443
all of those barrels

519
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:02,443
are already marked.

520
00:15:02,443 --> 00:15:04,362
We solve

521
00:15:02,443 --> 00:15:04,362
the problem we can.

522
00:15:04,362 --> 00:15:07,323
This has not

523
00:15:04,362 --> 00:15:07,323
changed the equation

524
00:15:04,362 --> 00:15:07,323
one iota for her.

525
00:15:07,323 --> 00:15:09,701
Oh, come on!

526
00:15:07,323 --> 00:15:09,701
You are not seriously

527
00:15:09,701 --> 00:15:11,786
still considering

528
00:15:09,701 --> 00:15:11,786
killing me?

529
00:15:11,786 --> 00:15:14,873
I saved you!

530
00:15:11,786 --> 00:15:14,873
If it weren't for me,

531
00:15:11,786 --> 00:15:14,873
we'd all be in jail right now!

532
00:15:14,873 --> 00:15:18,334
I hate to say it,

533
00:15:14,873 --> 00:15:18,334
but she's...

534
00:15:14,873 --> 00:15:18,334
She's right, Mike.

535
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:21,504
She saved our asses

536
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:21,504
by finding that thing.

537
00:15:21,504 --> 00:15:24,799
She was saving herself.

538
00:15:21,504 --> 00:15:24,799
She's a loose cannon.

539
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:27,468
I am telling you,

540
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:27,468
she will turn a gun

541
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:27,468
or a badge on us

542
00:15:27,468 --> 00:15:29,846
the first chance

543
00:15:27,468 --> 00:15:29,846
she gets.

544
00:15:29,846 --> 00:15:31,514
The woman

545
00:15:31,514 --> 00:15:33,933
put a hit out on me.

546
00:15:35,101 --> 00:15:37,103
Seriously?

547
00:15:38,104 --> 00:15:39,272
Wait. A hit?

548
00:15:39,272 --> 00:15:42,275
What?

549
00:15:39,272 --> 00:15:42,275
Like the mafia?

550
00:15:42,275 --> 00:15:45,570
Yeah, like the mafia.

551
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:48,698
Hey!

552
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:48,698
You still need methylamine,

553
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:48,698
don't you? Right?

554
00:15:48,698 --> 00:15:50,199
You wanna

555
00:15:48,698 --> 00:15:50,199
talk methylamine?

556
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:52,535
Then tell your partner

557
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:52,535
to stop threatening me,

558
00:15:52,535 --> 00:15:53,912
and let's talk.

559
00:15:53,912 --> 00:15:56,539
Talk about what?

560
00:15:53,912 --> 00:15:56,539
You heard.

561
00:15:56,539 --> 00:15:58,792
You can't even

562
00:15:56,539 --> 00:15:58,792
get us a single barrel.

563
00:15:58,792 --> 00:16:00,835
Who said anything

564
00:15:58,792 --> 00:16:00,835
about barrels?

565
00:16:00,835 --> 00:16:05,047
I'm talking about

566
00:16:00,835 --> 00:16:05,047
an ocean of the stuff.

567
00:16:10,845 --> 00:16:13,514
Just give him a minute,

568
00:16:10,845 --> 00:16:13,514
would you?

569
00:16:13,514 --> 00:16:15,475
Trust him.

570
00:16:15,475 --> 00:16:17,017
"Trust him."

571
00:16:17,017 --> 00:16:18,519
(LAUGHS)

572
00:16:21,773 --> 00:16:24,776
Okay.

573
00:16:21,773 --> 00:16:24,776
So, let's hear it.

574
00:16:24,776 --> 00:16:27,946
Not without a guarantee

575
00:16:24,776 --> 00:16:27,946
that once I tell you

576
00:16:24,776 --> 00:16:27,946
how to get what you want,

577
00:16:27,946 --> 00:16:29,447
I won't be killed anyway.

578
00:16:29,447 --> 00:16:32,826
Fine. You have my word.

579
00:16:29,447 --> 00:16:32,826
Not good enough.

580
00:16:32,826 --> 00:16:34,076
(CHUCKLES)

581
00:16:32,826 --> 00:16:34,076
Look, lady...

582
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:35,995
Do you have children?

583
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:37,997
That has nothing

584
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:37,997
to do with this.

585
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:41,668
It's not a trick question.

586
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:41,668
Why don't you just answer it?

587
00:16:41,668 --> 00:16:44,963
Yes, I have children.

588
00:16:41,668 --> 00:16:44,963
So what?

589
00:16:44,963 --> 00:16:47,173
You think that somehow

590
00:16:44,963 --> 00:16:47,173
because we're both parents

591
00:16:47,173 --> 00:16:49,342
that I won't let my partner

592
00:16:47,173 --> 00:16:49,342
do what's necessary?

593
00:16:49,342 --> 00:16:51,385
Swear on their lives.

594
00:16:49,342 --> 00:16:51,385
Oh, what?

595
00:16:51,385 --> 00:16:53,972
Swear on your

596
00:16:51,385 --> 00:16:53,972
children's lives that

597
00:16:51,385 --> 00:16:53,972
I won't be harmed.

598
00:16:53,972 --> 00:16:56,307
Otherwise,

599
00:16:53,972 --> 00:16:56,307
how can I trust you?

600
00:16:56,307 --> 00:16:59,978
Look, you're

601
00:16:56,307 --> 00:16:59,978
a smart businesswoman.

602
00:16:59,978 --> 00:17:01,896
You understand

603
00:16:59,978 --> 00:17:01,896
the concept of leverage.

604
00:17:01,896 --> 00:17:03,690
Please don't patronize me.

605
00:17:01,896 --> 00:17:03,690
I hate that.

606
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:06,150
You have none.

607
00:17:09,236 --> 00:17:14,116
But trust has to work

608
00:17:09,236 --> 00:17:14,116
both ways, Lydia.

609
00:17:14,116 --> 00:17:17,077
Is it true that you put

610
00:17:14,116 --> 00:17:17,077
a hit out on Mike?

611
00:17:20,206 --> 00:17:21,374
Yes.

612
00:17:21,374 --> 00:17:23,918
Why?

613
00:17:21,374 --> 00:17:23,918
I was scared.

614
00:17:24,961 --> 00:17:26,253
Of Mike?

615
00:17:26,253 --> 00:17:28,339
Not at first.

616
00:17:28,339 --> 00:17:30,967
There are men who used

617
00:17:28,339 --> 00:17:30,967
to work with Gus Fring

618
00:17:28,339 --> 00:17:30,967
in custody right now.

619
00:17:30,967 --> 00:17:34,094
Nine of them.

620
00:17:30,967 --> 00:17:34,094
They know everything

621
00:17:30,967 --> 00:17:34,094
about me. Everything.

622
00:17:34,094 --> 00:17:35,596
Some of them

623
00:17:34,094 --> 00:17:35,596
even know about you,

624
00:17:35,596 --> 00:17:36,931
assuming you're

625
00:17:35,596 --> 00:17:36,931
the master chemist

626
00:17:36,931 --> 00:17:40,351
they're always

627
00:17:36,931 --> 00:17:40,351
talking about.

628
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:44,313
And if it's these nine

629
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:44,313
that you're worried about,

630
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:45,940
why put the hit on Mike?

631
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:47,775
I had no choice.

632
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:47,775
I'm not going to prison

633
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:49,819
and have my daughter raised

634
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:49,819
in some horrible group home.

635
00:17:49,819 --> 00:17:52,739
Do you have any idea

636
00:17:49,819 --> 00:17:52,739
what those places are like?

637
00:17:52,739 --> 00:17:54,574
I gave him

638
00:17:52,739 --> 00:17:54,574
a list of names,

639
00:17:54,574 --> 00:17:57,035
but instead of handling it,

640
00:17:54,574 --> 00:17:57,035
he's protecting them.

641
00:17:57,035 --> 00:17:58,995
So I hired someone else.

642
00:17:57,035 --> 00:17:58,995
At that point,

643
00:17:58,995 --> 00:18:02,289
there was no option

644
00:17:58,995 --> 00:18:02,289
but to add Mike to the list.

645
00:18:06,753 --> 00:18:10,256
This ocean of methylamine

646
00:18:10,256 --> 00:18:14,176
that you claim

647
00:18:10,256 --> 00:18:14,176
you can get your hands on,

648
00:18:14,176 --> 00:18:17,346
how much are we

649
00:18:14,176 --> 00:18:17,346
talking about, literally?

650
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:20,641
How does

651
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:20,641
24,000 gallons sound?

652
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:25,563
Once a week,

653
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:25,563
on a Wednesday,

654
00:18:25,563 --> 00:18:27,565
a freight train leaves

655
00:18:25,563 --> 00:18:27,565
the Port of Long Beach

656
00:18:27,565 --> 00:18:30,150
loaded with

657
00:18:27,565 --> 00:18:30,150
industrial chemicals.

658
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:32,737
There's always at least

659
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:32,737
one tanker car

660
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:32,737
full of methylamine,

661
00:18:32,737 --> 00:18:35,406
which we import from

662
00:18:32,737 --> 00:18:35,406
a manufacturer in Guangzhou.

663
00:18:35,406 --> 00:18:38,076
The train travels east

664
00:18:35,406 --> 00:18:38,076
through Arizona,

665
00:18:38,076 --> 00:18:40,578
stops at a rail yard

666
00:18:38,076 --> 00:18:40,578
outside Flagstaff

667
00:18:40,578 --> 00:18:42,162
where it gets broken down

668
00:18:40,578 --> 00:18:42,162
and rebuilt.

669
00:18:42,162 --> 00:18:43,915
But the methylamine

670
00:18:42,162 --> 00:18:43,915
always moves on,

671
00:18:43,915 --> 00:18:46,960
destined for

672
00:18:43,915 --> 00:18:46,960
our pesticide concerns

673
00:18:43,915 --> 00:18:46,960
in Texas and Oklahoma.

674
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:49,629
Which means that

675
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:49,629
it passes right through

676
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:49,629
your home state.

677
00:18:49,629 --> 00:18:53,215
There's a remote

678
00:18:49,629 --> 00:18:53,215
three-mile stretch here,

679
00:18:53,215 --> 00:18:55,342
in McKinley county.

680
00:18:55,342 --> 00:18:57,344
That's where you do it.

681
00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:01,140
That's where

682
00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:01,140
we do what, exactly?

683
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:02,433
Get your methylamine.

684
00:19:02,433 --> 00:19:05,603
Like, rob it?

685
00:19:02,433 --> 00:19:05,603
Like Jesse James?

686
00:19:05,603 --> 00:19:08,314
You want the stuff?

687
00:19:05,603 --> 00:19:08,314
I'm offering you enough

688
00:19:05,603 --> 00:19:08,314
to fill a swimming pool.

689
00:19:08,314 --> 00:19:12,359
You are offering us

690
00:19:08,314 --> 00:19:12,359
a quick trip to prison.

691
00:19:08,314 --> 00:19:12,359
That's what I'm hearing.

692
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:14,654
Stopping a train,

693
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:14,654
post 9/11?

694
00:19:14,654 --> 00:19:16,781
You have any idea

695
00:19:14,654 --> 00:19:16,781
how many alarms

696
00:19:16,781 --> 00:19:19,199
that's gonna set off

697
00:19:16,781 --> 00:19:19,199
between here and DC?

698
00:19:19,199 --> 00:19:21,285
None, if you do it

699
00:19:19,199 --> 00:19:21,285
right here.

700
00:19:21,285 --> 00:19:23,370
If a freight train

701
00:19:21,285 --> 00:19:23,370
is stopped in transit

702
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:25,456
anywhere other than

703
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:25,456
the usual yards or depots,

704
00:19:25,456 --> 00:19:27,500
absolutely, a signal

705
00:19:25,456 --> 00:19:27,500
will automatically alarm

706
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,919
the FRA and the

707
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,919
TSA surface division

708
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:31,504
at the Department

709
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:31,504
of Homeland Security.

710
00:19:31,504 --> 00:19:33,506
But what you

711
00:19:31,504 --> 00:19:33,506
don't know, and I do,

712
00:19:33,506 --> 00:19:36,676
because my job

713
00:19:33,506 --> 00:19:36,676
requires me to keep track

714
00:19:33,506 --> 00:19:36,676
of my buyers' shipments,

715
00:19:36,676 --> 00:19:39,219
this is dark territory.

716
00:19:39,219 --> 00:19:42,015
What's that?

717
00:19:39,219 --> 00:19:42,015
Train-speak for an area

718
00:19:39,219 --> 00:19:42,015
of no contact.

719
00:19:42,015 --> 00:19:43,891
It's a dead zone.

720
00:19:43,891 --> 00:19:45,685
No automated

721
00:19:43,891 --> 00:19:45,685
supervision system,

722
00:19:45,685 --> 00:19:48,270
no alarms,

723
00:19:45,685 --> 00:19:48,270
no contact with control.

724
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:49,939
What about

725
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:49,939
cell phones?

726
00:19:49,939 --> 00:19:52,566
Crew could just

727
00:19:49,939 --> 00:19:52,566
call the cops.

728
00:19:49,939 --> 00:19:52,566
No cellular either.

729
00:19:52,566 --> 00:19:55,528
I'm telling you,

730
00:19:52,566 --> 00:19:55,528
it's the perfect place.

731
00:19:55,528 --> 00:19:57,613
You'd have time enough

732
00:19:55,528 --> 00:19:57,613
to stop the train,

733
00:19:57,613 --> 00:20:00,324
siphon off

734
00:19:57,613 --> 00:20:00,324
as much methylamine

735
00:19:57,613 --> 00:20:00,324
as you can carry,

736
00:20:00,324 --> 00:20:01,617
and get away

737
00:20:00,324 --> 00:20:01,617
before the police...

738
00:20:01,617 --> 00:20:03,536
Wait a minute.

739
00:20:01,617 --> 00:20:03,536
Wait a minute.

740
00:20:03,536 --> 00:20:06,831
Assuming we can stop

741
00:20:03,536 --> 00:20:06,831
a moving train,

742
00:20:06,831 --> 00:20:08,624
how do we know

743
00:20:06,831 --> 00:20:08,624
we have the right one?

744
00:20:08,624 --> 00:20:10,710
And which tanker car

745
00:20:08,624 --> 00:20:10,710
is which?

746
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:13,171
I can't believe

747
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:13,171
that they would

748
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:13,171
advertise their contents.

749
00:20:13,171 --> 00:20:15,631
Once the train

750
00:20:13,171 --> 00:20:15,631
gets rebuilt in Flagstaff,

751
00:20:15,631 --> 00:20:18,509
a final manifest

752
00:20:15,631 --> 00:20:18,509
gets uploaded

753
00:20:15,631 --> 00:20:18,509
to my company's server.

754
00:20:18,509 --> 00:20:21,804
I'll have it for you

755
00:20:18,509 --> 00:20:21,804
sometime between midnight

756
00:20:18,509 --> 00:20:21,804
and 2:00 AM.

757
00:20:21,804 --> 00:20:24,765
That'll give you at least

758
00:20:21,804 --> 00:20:24,765
six hours of lead time.

759
00:20:24,765 --> 00:20:26,475
Keep in mind,

760
00:20:26,475 --> 00:20:28,602
I'm taking a huge risk

761
00:20:26,475 --> 00:20:28,602
supplying this information.

762
00:20:28,602 --> 00:20:31,355
I expect to be paid.

763
00:20:28,602 --> 00:20:31,355
(SCOFFS)

764
00:20:33,315 --> 00:20:35,401
We can talk

765
00:20:33,315 --> 00:20:35,401
percentages later.

766
00:20:35,401 --> 00:20:37,611
You know what this means,

767
00:20:35,401 --> 00:20:37,611
don't you?

768
00:20:37,611 --> 00:20:39,446
We've gotta

769
00:20:37,611 --> 00:20:39,446
off the crew.

770
00:20:39,446 --> 00:20:41,365
How do you figure?

771
00:20:41,365 --> 00:20:43,534
Well, if we don't,

772
00:20:41,365 --> 00:20:43,534
the engineer's gonna

773
00:20:41,365 --> 00:20:43,534
call the cops

774
00:20:43,534 --> 00:20:45,661
as soon as he

775
00:20:43,534 --> 00:20:45,661
gets out of the dead zone.

776
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:48,330
It's only three miles long.

777
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:48,330
But we're way out

778
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:48,330
in the boonies.

779
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:50,208
I don't care

780
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:50,208
if it's in the Gobi desert.

781
00:20:50,208 --> 00:20:53,460
Once they get word,

782
00:20:50,208 --> 00:20:53,460
the FBI and Homeland Security

783
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:55,379
are gonna swoop down

784
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:55,379
with choppers on us

785
00:20:55,379 --> 00:20:57,131
so fast it'll make

786
00:20:55,379 --> 00:20:57,131
our heads spin.

787
00:20:57,131 --> 00:20:59,675
And there is no hiding

788
00:20:57,131 --> 00:20:59,675
in that open country.

789
00:20:59,675 --> 00:21:01,886
How many in the crew?

790
00:20:59,675 --> 00:21:01,886
LYDIA: Just two.

791
00:21:01,886 --> 00:21:03,179
An engineer

792
00:21:01,886 --> 00:21:03,179
and a conductor.

793
00:21:03,179 --> 00:21:05,181
Assuming there are

794
00:21:03,179 --> 00:21:05,181
no security guards.

795
00:21:05,181 --> 00:21:08,226
No guards.

796
00:21:05,181 --> 00:21:08,226
It's not like we're

797
00:21:05,181 --> 00:21:08,226
carrying nuclear warheads.

798
00:21:08,226 --> 00:21:10,269
Wait. Two guys.

799
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:12,479
Can't we just

800
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:12,479
tie them up or something?

801
00:21:12,479 --> 00:21:15,108
And then what?

802
00:21:12,479 --> 00:21:15,108
Even if we wear a mask,

803
00:21:15,108 --> 00:21:17,902
we're leaving

804
00:21:15,108 --> 00:21:17,902
two witnesses behind.

805
00:21:17,902 --> 00:21:19,528
Bottom line,

806
00:21:19,528 --> 00:21:21,321
I have done this

807
00:21:19,528 --> 00:21:21,321
long enough to know

808
00:21:21,321 --> 00:21:24,324
that there are

809
00:21:21,321 --> 00:21:24,324
two kinds of heists:

810
00:21:24,324 --> 00:21:27,369
Those where the guys

811
00:21:24,324 --> 00:21:27,369
get away with it

812
00:21:27,369 --> 00:21:29,956
and those that

813
00:21:27,369 --> 00:21:29,956
leave witnesses.

814
00:21:29,956 --> 00:21:31,749
(SCOFFS) Give me a break.

815
00:21:31,749 --> 00:21:33,751
You guys

816
00:21:31,749 --> 00:21:33,751
were gonna murder me.

817
00:21:33,751 --> 00:21:36,796
I thought

818
00:21:33,751 --> 00:21:36,796
you were professionals.

819
00:21:36,796 --> 00:21:38,923
(GIBBERISH)

820
00:21:38,923 --> 00:21:42,301
Can you say "ASAC"?

821
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:44,804
"Aaay-sac."

822
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:44,804
Can you say that?

823
00:21:44,804 --> 00:21:47,681
Say, (SINGSONG VOICE)

824
00:21:44,804 --> 00:21:47,681
"ASAC Schrader."

825
00:21:47,681 --> 00:21:49,349
If those turn out

826
00:21:47,681 --> 00:21:49,349
to be her first words,

827
00:21:49,349 --> 00:21:51,269
I will beat you

828
00:21:49,349 --> 00:21:51,269
with my shoe.

829
00:21:51,269 --> 00:21:52,937
Don't listen to him, Holly.

830
00:21:52,937 --> 00:21:55,689
Aw, I'm just telling it

831
00:21:52,937 --> 00:21:55,689
like it is, babe.

832
00:21:55,689 --> 00:21:57,984
Boss man.

833
00:21:55,689 --> 00:21:57,984
I'm the boss man.

834
00:21:57,984 --> 00:22:00,069
Say, "Boss man."

835
00:22:00,069 --> 00:22:02,613
Am I the boss man?

836
00:22:00,069 --> 00:22:02,613
I'm the boss.

837
00:22:02,613 --> 00:22:04,782
Hey, that better be

838
00:22:02,613 --> 00:22:04,782
something from a boob

839
00:22:04,782 --> 00:22:06,533
instead of some

840
00:22:04,782 --> 00:22:06,533
fake soy crap.

841
00:22:06,533 --> 00:22:08,911
Yeah, yeah.

842
00:22:06,533 --> 00:22:08,911
My little girl...

843
00:22:08,911 --> 00:22:11,330
Your little girl. Oh.

844
00:22:08,911 --> 00:22:11,330
...deserves the real McCoy.

(FUSSING)

846
00:22:12,498 --> 00:22:13,958
Oh, no. See?

847
00:22:12,498 --> 00:22:13,958
Okay.

848
00:22:13,958 --> 00:22:16,752
She doesn't want it.

849
00:22:13,958 --> 00:22:16,752
No, she wants me.

850
00:22:16,752 --> 00:22:18,754
She wants me.

851
00:22:18,754 --> 00:22:20,506
(SIGHS)

852
00:22:20,506 --> 00:22:24,218
Yeah, my little girl,

853
00:22:20,506 --> 00:22:24,218
'cause I'm not

854
00:22:20,506 --> 00:22:24,218
giving her back.

855
00:22:24,218 --> 00:22:26,386
Yeah, I know.

856
00:22:26,386 --> 00:22:27,805
What about Emo McGee?

857
00:22:27,805 --> 00:22:29,932
Has he come out

858
00:22:27,805 --> 00:22:29,932
of his room today?

859
00:22:29,932 --> 00:22:31,309
Barely.

860
00:22:31,309 --> 00:22:32,935
When he does,

861
00:22:31,309 --> 00:22:32,935
he barely talks.

862
00:22:32,935 --> 00:22:35,353
Yeah, well,

863
00:22:32,935 --> 00:22:35,353
what do you expect,

864
00:22:32,935 --> 00:22:35,353
you know?

865
00:22:35,353 --> 00:22:38,482
His parents treat him

866
00:22:35,353 --> 00:22:38,482
like he's a baby there.

867
00:22:39,942 --> 00:22:41,944
(BABBLING)

868
00:22:46,157 --> 00:22:49,660
Flynn,

869
00:22:46,157 --> 00:22:49,660
do you want me to heat up

870
00:22:46,157 --> 00:22:49,660
some of that lasagna

871
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:51,662
to hold you over

872
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:51,662
till dinner?

873
00:22:51,662 --> 00:22:52,913
No.

874
00:22:52,913 --> 00:22:54,915
Hey, I picked up<i> Heat</i>

875
00:22:52,913 --> 00:22:54,915
on blu-ray.

876
00:22:54,915 --> 00:22:56,750
Wanna watch it

877
00:22:54,915 --> 00:22:56,750
with me later?

878
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:58,336
No.

879
00:22:58,336 --> 00:23:01,839
And you can keep

880
00:22:58,336 --> 00:23:01,839
talking about me now.

881
00:23:05,634 --> 00:23:08,762
Well, if no one else

882
00:23:05,634 --> 00:23:08,762
is gonna offer an opinion,

883
00:23:05,634 --> 00:23:08,762
I will.

884
00:23:08,762 --> 00:23:10,681
We do it

885
00:23:08,762 --> 00:23:10,681
the old-fashioned way.

886
00:23:10,681 --> 00:23:12,808
We hit skid row,

887
00:23:10,681 --> 00:23:12,808
the crystal palace,

888
00:23:12,808 --> 00:23:14,352
all the halfway houses,

889
00:23:14,352 --> 00:23:16,062
scrounge up about

890
00:23:14,352 --> 00:23:16,062
a dozen skells,

891
00:23:16,062 --> 00:23:17,938
and put them to work

892
00:23:16,062 --> 00:23:17,938
smurfing cold pills.

893
00:23:17,938 --> 00:23:20,066
You mean switch back

894
00:23:17,938 --> 00:23:20,066
to a pseudo cook.

895
00:23:20,066 --> 00:23:22,026
You're the chemist.

896
00:23:20,066 --> 00:23:22,026
Admittedly,

897
00:23:22,026 --> 00:23:24,028
it's gonna

898
00:23:22,026 --> 00:23:24,028
cut down on our output.

899
00:23:24,028 --> 00:23:26,530
Like a factor

900
00:23:24,028 --> 00:23:26,530
of four or five.

901
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:29,783
It also means that

902
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:29,783
we will eat $80,000

903
00:23:29,783 --> 00:23:32,536
we just invested

904
00:23:29,783 --> 00:23:32,536
in our new lab equipment,

905
00:23:32,536 --> 00:23:34,914
which is only good

906
00:23:32,536 --> 00:23:34,914
for a p2p cook.

907
00:23:34,914 --> 00:23:37,624
You know, I don't have

908
00:23:34,914 --> 00:23:37,624
to do the math to know

909
00:23:37,624 --> 00:23:39,877
that we'd be making

910
00:23:37,624 --> 00:23:39,877
a fraction of the profit.

911
00:23:39,877 --> 00:23:44,631
And making less money

912
00:23:39,877 --> 00:23:44,631
is better than making nothing.

913
00:23:44,631 --> 00:23:47,801
Oh, yeah, Mike?

914
00:23:44,631 --> 00:23:47,801
Well, why don't you

915
00:23:44,631 --> 00:23:47,801
tell us why?

916
00:23:47,801 --> 00:23:51,055
Why is making nothing

917
00:23:47,801 --> 00:23:51,055
not an option?

918
00:23:51,055 --> 00:23:52,973
Walter...

919
00:23:51,055 --> 00:23:52,973
Let me tell you why.

920
00:23:52,973 --> 00:23:55,517
It's because

921
00:23:52,973 --> 00:23:55,517
of your nine guys

922
00:23:52,973 --> 00:23:55,517
in lockup, right?

923
00:23:55,517 --> 00:23:57,603
You broke it,

924
00:23:55,517 --> 00:23:57,603
you pay for it.

925
00:23:57,603 --> 00:23:59,272
And we've talked about

926
00:23:57,603 --> 00:23:59,272
this plenty already.

927
00:23:59,272 --> 00:24:01,399
Well, maybe we better

928
00:23:59,272 --> 00:24:01,399
talk about it a little more,

929
00:24:01,399 --> 00:24:03,692
because what it sounds like

930
00:24:01,399 --> 00:24:03,692
you're telling me, Mike,

931
00:24:03,692 --> 00:24:05,319
is that from now on,

932
00:24:05,319 --> 00:24:08,072
we have no choice but to do

933
00:24:05,319 --> 00:24:08,072
this piddling pseudo cook

934
00:24:08,072 --> 00:24:10,408
so that we can

935
00:24:08,072 --> 00:24:10,408
pay back your guys.

936
00:24:10,408 --> 00:24:13,493
Or else what? Or else

937
00:24:10,408 --> 00:24:13,493
they're gonna rat on us,

938
00:24:10,408 --> 00:24:13,493
and we end up in prison.

939
00:24:13,493 --> 00:24:17,331
Yeah?

940
00:24:13,493 --> 00:24:17,331
And it sounds like what

941
00:24:13,493 --> 00:24:17,331
you're telling me, Walter,

942
00:24:17,331 --> 00:24:19,917
is that you

943
00:24:17,331 --> 00:24:19,917
wanna do this heist,

944
00:24:19,917 --> 00:24:23,087
even if it means killing

945
00:24:19,917 --> 00:24:23,087
a couple of innocent men.

946
00:24:23,087 --> 00:24:25,631
That what you want?

947
00:24:25,631 --> 00:24:27,341
You know,

948
00:24:25,631 --> 00:24:27,341
I don't know why

949
00:24:27,341 --> 00:24:28,926
you insist on putting

950
00:24:27,341 --> 00:24:28,926
words in my mouth here.

951
00:24:28,926 --> 00:24:31,469
What if we can

952
00:24:28,926 --> 00:24:31,469
rip off that train,

953
00:24:31,469 --> 00:24:34,514
and no one ever knows

954
00:24:31,469 --> 00:24:34,514
it got robbed?

955
00:24:44,442 --> 00:24:46,735
(WIND HOWLING)

00:24:48,279 --> 00:24:50,156

00:24:54,701 --> 00:24:57,704
Just maybe.

958
00:25:08,007 --> 00:25:10,176
It'll come

959
00:25:08,007 --> 00:25:10,176
from that direction.

Todd, on the day,

986
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:25,852
are you gonna be able

987
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:25,852
to make this climb?

988
00:27:25,852 --> 00:27:28,688
Yes, sir.

989
00:27:25,852 --> 00:27:28,688
I'll be ready.

990
00:27:28,688 --> 00:27:30,648

ask you a question?

No. Go ahead.

00:27:34,111 --> 00:27:36,489
Well, I get why we want

995
00:27:34,111 --> 00:27:36,489
the tank for the methylamine.

996
00:27:36,489 --> 00:27:38,240
But why this other one

997
00:27:36,489 --> 00:27:38,240
for the water?

998
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:41,535
Well...

Jesse, it's your idea.

You wanna fill him in?

1001
00:27:45,456 --> 00:27:47,416
It's all about

1002
00:27:45,456 --> 00:27:47,416
the weight, yo.

1003
00:27:47,416 --> 00:27:49,168
The tanker

1004
00:27:47,416 --> 00:27:49,168
we're gonna hit,

when it's unloaded

1011
00:27:54,714 --> 00:27:56,674
If the weights

1012
00:27:54,714 --> 00:27:56,674
don't match,

1013
00:27:56,674 --> 00:27:58,594

gonna know it got robbed.

1015
00:27:58,594 --> 00:28:00,387
Okay.

1016
00:28:00,387 --> 00:28:03,432
Boosting methylamine

1017
00:28:00,387 --> 00:28:03,432
from a train is,

1018
00:28:00,387 --> 00:28:03,432
like, a major rap.

1019
00:28:03,432 --> 00:28:06,726
The point is,

1020
00:28:03,432 --> 00:28:06,726
no one other than us

1021
00:28:06,726 --> 00:28:09,813
can ever know that

1022
00:28:06,726 --> 00:28:09,813
this robbery went down.

1023
00:28:09,813 --> 00:28:12,690
Nobody.

1024
00:28:09,813 --> 00:28:12,690
You got it?

1025
00:28:15,194 --> 00:28:16,987
Yeah. Absolutely.

1026
00:28:18,405 --> 00:28:19,739
Are you sure?

1027
00:28:19,739 --> 00:28:21,575
Yes, sir.

1028
00:28:21,575 --> 00:28:23,327
With all that said,

1029
00:28:23,327 --> 00:28:25,871
the whole thing

1030
00:28:23,327 --> 00:28:25,871
relies on us

1031
00:28:25,871 --> 00:28:27,331
replacing the weight

1032
00:28:25,871 --> 00:28:27,331
of methylamine we steal

1033
00:28:27,331 --> 00:28:29,124
with the same weight

1034
00:28:27,331 --> 00:28:29,124
in water.

1035
00:28:29,124 --> 00:28:31,585
Right on.

1036
00:28:29,124 --> 00:28:31,585
So they'll never know

1037
00:28:29,124 --> 00:28:31,585
we hit them. Cool.

1038
00:28:31,585 --> 00:28:33,879
Aqueous methylamine

1039
00:28:31,585 --> 00:28:33,879
is water-based,

1040
00:28:33,879 --> 00:28:36,048
yet it weighs

1041
00:28:33,879 --> 00:28:36,048
slightly less than water.

1042
00:28:36,048 --> 00:28:38,384
So, we will be removing

1043
00:28:38,384 --> 00:28:41,428
a thousand gallons

1044
00:28:38,384 --> 00:28:41,428
of methylamine

1045
00:28:38,384 --> 00:28:41,428
from the tanker car,

1046
00:28:41,428 --> 00:28:42,971
but replacing it

1047
00:28:42,971 --> 00:28:46,016
with about nine-tenths

1048
00:28:42,971 --> 00:28:46,016
of that volume in water,

1049
00:28:46,016 --> 00:28:50,020
which comes to

1050
00:28:46,016 --> 00:28:50,020
900.24 gallons.

1051
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:51,897
Actually, Jesse,

1052
00:28:51,897 --> 00:28:53,899
let's make that

1053
00:28:51,897 --> 00:28:53,899
an even 920

1054
00:28:53,899 --> 00:28:56,985
to account for spillage

1055
00:28:53,899 --> 00:28:56,985
and whatever will remain

1056
00:28:53,899 --> 00:28:56,985
in the hose.

1057
00:28:56,985 --> 00:28:58,654
How we doing,

1058
00:28:56,985 --> 00:28:58,654
by the way?

1059
00:28:58,654 --> 00:29:00,864
Uh, 850.

1060
00:29:00,864 --> 00:29:02,866
We're almost there.

1061
00:29:00,864 --> 00:29:02,866
All right.

1062
00:29:02,866 --> 00:29:04,826
But won't they figure out

1063
00:29:02,866 --> 00:29:04,826
they got robbed anyway

1064
00:29:04,826 --> 00:29:06,495
on account of getting

1065
00:29:04,826 --> 00:29:06,495
watered-down methylamine?

1066
00:29:06,495 --> 00:29:09,122
Well,

1067
00:29:06,495 --> 00:29:09,122
out of 24,000 gallons,

1068
00:29:09,122 --> 00:29:14,044
it'll only amount to about

1069
00:29:09,122 --> 00:29:14,044
four percent dilution, so...

1070
00:29:14,044 --> 00:29:17,047
But, yes, you're right.

1071
00:29:14,044 --> 00:29:17,047
They will notice.

1072
00:29:17,047 --> 00:29:20,884
At which point,

1073
00:29:17,047 --> 00:29:20,884
they will blame China

1074
00:29:20,884 --> 00:29:24,555
for sending

1075
00:29:20,884 --> 00:29:24,555

I'm not your wife,

I'm your hostage.

1142

1143
00:31:31,598 --> 00:31:35,519
on keeping me imprisoned,

1144
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:37,187

of days ago,

1157
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:00,960
you told me that a man

1158
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:00,960
held a gun to your head.

1159
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:04,381
You said it like

1160
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:04,381
it was a point of pride.

1161
00:32:04,381 --> 00:32:06,466

00:32:04,381 --> 00:32:06,466
