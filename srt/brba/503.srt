00:07:14,184 --> 00:07:15,435
Yes.

199
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:17,437
He handles the business,

200
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:19,981
and I handle him.

201
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:27,739
SAUL:

202
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:27,739
Clearly, we're talking

203
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:27,739
about renting, not buying.

204
00:07:27,739 --> 00:07:29,616
You need

205
00:07:27,739 --> 00:07:29,616
an ongoing business,

206
00:07:29,616 --> 00:07:32,577
someplace you can

207
00:07:29,616 --> 00:07:32,577
slide in, do your thing,

208
00:07:29,616 --> 00:07:32,577
and remain anonymous.

209
00:07:32,577 --> 00:07:34,246
I'm not gonna

210
00:07:32,577 --> 00:07:34,246
mince words.

211
00:07:34,246 --> 00:07:36,497
This is your best bet.

212
00:07:36,497 --> 00:07:38,250
Got machines running,

213
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:41,169
forklifts,

214
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:41,169
people coming and going.

215
00:07:41,169 --> 00:07:43,671
You're gonna stay

216
00:07:41,169 --> 00:07:43,671
way under the radar.

217
00:07:43,671 --> 00:07:45,257
And the owner's solid.

218
00:07:45,257 --> 00:07:47,801
He can't wait to

219
00:07:45,257 --> 00:07:47,801
throw up a curtain wall,

220
00:07:47,801 --> 00:07:50,637
stack some boxes

221
00:07:47,801 --> 00:07:50,637
in front of it, give you

222
00:07:47,801 --> 00:07:50,637
all the space you need.

223
00:07:50,637 --> 00:07:53,598
After that,

224
00:07:50,637 --> 00:07:53,598
he's got his business,

225
00:07:50,637 --> 00:07:53,598
you've got yours,

226
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:55,434
and never the twain

227
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:55,434
shall meet.

228
00:07:55,434 --> 00:07:57,852
It's outstanding.

229
00:07:55,434 --> 00:07:57,852
Am I right?

230
00:07:57,852 --> 00:08:00,939
Machines like this,

231
00:07:57,852 --> 00:08:00,939
gotta be plenty of power.

232
00:08:00,939 --> 00:08:02,190
What about the smell?

233
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:03,817
Ah. More good news.

234
00:08:03,817 --> 00:08:05,568
I've been here

235
00:08:03,817 --> 00:08:05,568
when it's up and running.

236
00:08:05,568 --> 00:08:08,029
This place stinks already.

237
00:08:05,568 --> 00:08:08,029
You'll blend right in.

238
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:09,614
How many employees?

239
00:08:09,614 --> 00:08:10,865
Ha. I knew you'd ask.

240
00:08:10,865 --> 00:08:13,368
Sixteen illegals,

241
00:08:13,368 --> 00:08:16,579
all highly motivated

242
00:08:13,368 --> 00:08:16,579
to stay deaf,

243
00:08:13,368 --> 00:08:16,579
blind, and dumb.

244
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:18,623
You'll want to

245
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:18,623
vet them, I'm sure.

246
00:08:18,623 --> 00:08:20,917
Yes, indeed.

247
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:22,710
So what do you say,

248
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:22,710
maestro?

249
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:25,172
Huh?

250
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:25,172
Is it unanimous?

251
00:08:25,172 --> 00:08:27,882
You know,

252
00:08:25,172 --> 00:08:27,882
I worked in a box factory

253
00:08:25,172 --> 00:08:27,882
one summer in high school,

254
00:08:27,882 --> 00:08:31,719
and I haven't seen

255
00:08:27,882 --> 00:08:31,719
one of these in years.

256
00:08:31,719 --> 00:08:33,888
Trip down memory lane.

257
00:08:31,719 --> 00:08:33,888
That's perfect.

258
00:08:33,888 --> 00:08:35,223
You know what this is?

259
00:08:35,223 --> 00:08:37,476
It's a corrugator.

260
00:08:37,476 --> 00:08:41,521
It uses steam and salt

261
00:08:37,476 --> 00:08:41,521
to crimp kraft paper

262
00:08:37,476 --> 00:08:41,521
for cardboard.

263
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:44,149
And it makes

264
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:44,149
a hell of a racket doing it,

265
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:44,149
which is great.

266
00:08:44,149 --> 00:08:46,943
Right?

267
00:08:44,149 --> 00:08:46,943
No.

268
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:48,695
Steam and salt.

269
00:08:48,695 --> 00:08:52,115
When this thing is running,

270
00:08:48,695 --> 00:08:52,115
it's like a jungle in here.

271
00:08:52,115 --> 00:08:55,994
Shit.

272
00:08:52,115 --> 00:08:55,994
It'll ruin the product.

273
00:08:55,994 --> 00:08:58,872
You can't just

274
00:08:55,994 --> 00:08:58,872
pop down to Costco

275
00:08:58,872 --> 00:09:00,957
and get

276
00:08:58,872 --> 00:09:00,957
a couple dehumidifiers?

277
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:05,253
What... Fine. Fine.

278
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:05,253
Moving on.

279
00:09:09,883 --> 00:09:12,802
Spacious,

280
00:09:09,883 --> 00:09:12,802
isolated location,

281
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:14,595
no humidity,

282
00:09:14,595 --> 00:09:16,348
and you get all the

283
00:09:14,595 --> 00:09:16,348
free tortillas you want.

284
00:09:16,348 --> 00:09:20,060
That's the special feature

285
00:09:16,348 --> 00:09:20,060
of this place.

286
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:21,811
I don't know.

287
00:09:21,811 --> 00:09:24,231
It'll make the tortillas

288
00:09:21,811 --> 00:09:24,231
smell like cat piss.

289
00:09:24,231 --> 00:09:26,774
Somebody's bound

290
00:09:24,231 --> 00:09:26,774
to notice that.

291
00:09:26,774 --> 00:09:30,320
All right. Well,

292
00:09:26,774 --> 00:09:30,320
there's gotta be some kind

293
00:09:26,774 --> 00:09:30,320
of workaround, right?

294
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,697
It's a technical problem.

295
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,697
You guys are technical guys.

296
00:09:32,697 --> 00:09:35,158
You know, be creative.

297
00:09:32,697 --> 00:09:35,158
Put your heads together.

298
00:09:35,158 --> 00:09:39,496
Anything food-related

299
00:09:35,158 --> 00:09:39,496
is gonna have unannounced

300
00:09:35,158 --> 00:09:39,496
government inspections.

301
00:09:48,547 --> 00:09:51,174
All I'm asking is that

302
00:09:48,547 --> 00:09:51,174
you keep an open mind.

303
00:09:51,174 --> 00:09:54,677
Danny's already

304
00:09:51,174 --> 00:09:54,677
set some space aside

305
00:09:51,174 --> 00:09:54,677
behind the skee ball games.

306
00:09:54,677 --> 00:09:56,721
[SCOFFS]

307
00:09:54,677 --> 00:09:56,721
No.

308
00:09:56,721 --> 00:09:58,932
Hell, no.

309
00:10:06,898 --> 00:10:08,316
I know it's a long shot.

310
00:10:09,817 --> 00:10:11,986
All I can say

311
00:10:09,817 --> 00:10:11,986
to recommend this one

312
00:10:11,986 --> 00:10:14,155
is we're talking about

313
00:10:11,986 --> 00:10:14,155
an owner here who is,

314
00:10:14,155 --> 00:10:17,075
how should I put it,

315
00:10:14,155 --> 00:10:17,075
highly amenable.

316
00:10:21,204 --> 00:10:24,665
Look, I get it.

317
00:10:21,204 --> 00:10:24,665
Just say no,

318
00:10:21,204 --> 00:10:24,665
and we'll go get dinner.

319
00:10:24,665 --> 00:10:27,001
All right.

320
00:10:24,665 --> 00:10:27,001
So I'll start.

321
00:10:27,001 --> 00:10:28,836
No way we're

322
00:10:27,001 --> 00:10:28,836
cooking in here.

323
00:10:28,836 --> 00:10:31,965
No space,

324
00:10:28,836 --> 00:10:31,965
nowhere for the smell to go.

325
00:10:31,965 --> 00:10:33,508
Look at that door.

326
00:10:33,508 --> 00:10:35,469
That thing rolls up,

327
00:10:33,508 --> 00:10:35,469
and we're open to the world.

328
00:10:35,469 --> 00:10:37,304
MIKE:

329
00:10:35,469 --> 00:10:37,304
I don't know

330
00:10:35,469 --> 00:10:37,304
if anybody noticed,

331
00:10:37,304 --> 00:10:40,056
but there's a cop shop

332
00:10:37,304 --> 00:10:40,056
a quarter of a mile away.

333
00:10:40,056 --> 00:10:44,227
The hammer comes down,

334
00:10:40,056 --> 00:10:44,227
it's gonna be

335
00:10:40,056 --> 00:10:44,227
Custer's Last Stand.

336
00:10:47,772 --> 00:10:49,316
It's perfect.

337
00:10:49,316 --> 00:10:50,691
What?

338
00:10:50,691 --> 00:10:52,235
How are we gonna

339
00:10:50,691 --> 00:10:52,235
fit a lab in here?

340
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:56,156
Who said here?

341
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:11,921
WALT:

342
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:11,921
A house is infested.

343
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:15,008
Termites,

344
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:15,008
cockroaches, whatever.

345
00:11:15,008 --> 00:11:18,512
Homeowners hire

346
00:11:15,008 --> 00:11:18,512
a pest control company.

347
00:11:18,512 --> 00:11:21,389
Truck rolls up,

348
00:11:18,512 --> 00:11:21,389
homeowners leave.

349
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:23,099
The crew

350
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:23,099
tents the house.

351
00:11:23,099 --> 00:11:25,852
They bomb the place

352
00:11:23,099 --> 00:11:25,852
with poison.

353
00:11:25,852 --> 00:11:27,854
The house stays

354
00:11:25,852 --> 00:11:27,854
like that for days.

355
00:11:27,854 --> 00:11:30,231
No one looks twice

356
00:11:27,854 --> 00:11:30,231
at a tented house.

357
00:11:30,231 --> 00:11:32,859
Now, maybe there's

358
00:11:30,231 --> 00:11:32,859
a strange smell

359
00:11:30,231 --> 00:11:32,859
coming out of it.

360
00:11:32,859 --> 00:11:35,195
Does someone think

361
00:11:32,859 --> 00:11:35,195
to investigate? No.

362
00:11:35,195 --> 00:11:38,781
Does anyone go inside?

363
00:11:35,195 --> 00:11:38,781
Hell, no.

364
00:11:41,326 --> 00:11:44,120
And that's

365
00:11:41,326 --> 00:11:44,120
where we'll cook.

366
00:11:45,664 --> 00:11:49,459
They tent, what,

367
00:11:45,664 --> 00:11:49,459
three, four houses a week?

368
00:11:49,459 --> 00:11:51,919
So we pick the one

369
00:11:49,459 --> 00:11:51,919
that's best for us.

370
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:54,130
Enough floor space,

371
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:54,130
easy access.

372
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:55,798
Once the tent is up,

373
00:11:55,798 --> 00:11:57,800
we go in,

374
00:11:55,798 --> 00:11:57,800
we cook a batch,

375
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:01,304
we bomb the place,

376
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:01,304
and leave.

377
00:12:01,304 --> 00:12:04,683
So we gotta move

378
00:12:01,304 --> 00:12:04,683
in and out for every cook?

379
00:12:04,683 --> 00:12:08,520
Set up the lab, cook,

380
00:12:04,683 --> 00:12:08,520
and then take everything down?

381
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:11,814
It's challenging

382
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:11,814
but doable.

383
00:12:11,814 --> 00:12:15,776
Tell me

384
00:12:11,814 --> 00:12:15,776
about these guys.

385
00:12:15,776 --> 00:12:17,820
Uh, Mr. Ponytail

386
00:12:15,776 --> 00:12:17,820
on the sidewalk, that's Ira.

387
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:20,781
He's the owner.

388
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:20,781
On the roof is Sandor.

389
00:12:20,781 --> 00:12:23,826
The ladder's Fernando,

390
00:12:20,781 --> 00:12:23,826
and down below, that's Todd.

391
00:12:23,826 --> 00:12:25,744
The pest control operation

392
00:12:23,826 --> 00:12:25,744
