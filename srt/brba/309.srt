Marie.

391
00:15:18,209 --> 00:15:22,672
Is the health plan's way

392
00:15:18,209 --> 00:15:22,672
medically justifiable? Sure.

393
00:15:22,672 --> 00:15:25,216
Is it absolutely optimal?

your frustration. Really, I do.

00:15:35,268 --> 00:15:38,438
But my best advice

401
00:15:35,268 --> 00:15:38,438
is stay in the network.

411
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:53,703
So what?

412
00:15:53,703 --> 00:15:56,247
We're just supposed

00:18:52,715 --> 00:18:55,009
They take every penny,

522
00:18:55,009 --> 00:18:58,512
and you go in the can

523
00:18:55,009 --> 00:18:58,512

00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:39,219
in a thriving business.

547
00:19:39,219 --> 00:19:43,599
So you want me to buy this place

548
00:19:39,219 --> 00:19:43,599

stay a criminal

552
00:19:48,062 --> 00:19:50,773

say, a convict,

554
00:19:50,773 --> 00:19:53,567

and listen to your lawyer.

556
00:19:53,567 --> 00:19:56,863
Right, so you can

557
00:19:53,567 --> 00:19:56,863

558
00:19:56,863 --> 00:19:59,032
No, that's 17 percent.

559
00:19:59,032 --> 00:20:02,118
I heard you say 5. You said

560
00:19:59,032 --> 00:20:02,118
it right in front of me.

561
00:20:02,118 --> 00:20:03,911
Yeah, that was for your partner.

562
00:20:03,911 --> 00:20:05,913

564
00:20:05,913 --> 00:20:07,707
But for you,

565
00:20:05,913 --> 00:20:07,707

566
00:20:07,707 --> 00:20:09,792
17 percent

567
00:20:07,707 --> 00:20:09,792

00:37:31,166 --> 00:37:35,212
it's just one thing.

964
00:37:35,212 --> 00:37:37,296
It's meth.

965
00:37:39,174 --> 00:37:42,177
It's bad.

966
00:37:42,177 --> 00:37:44,930
Thought I had it kicked

967
00:37:42,177 --> 00:37:44,930
a couple times, you know.

968
00:37:44,930 --> 00:37:49,184
But then, Jesus,

969
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:52,812
this new version of it

970
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:52,812
hit the streets,

971
00:37:52,812 --> 00:37:54,231
and, wow.

972
00:37:54,231 --> 00:37:57,150
Not that blue stuff.

973
00:37:57,150 --> 00:37:59,819
Oh, sorry.

974
00:37:57,150 --> 00:37:59,819
I didn't raise my hand.

975
00:37:59,819 --> 00:38:01,863
No, go ahead.

976
00:37:59,819 --> 00:38:01,863
This is what we do.

977
00:38:01,863 --> 00:38:05,408
Yeah, exactly, the blue stuff.

978
00:38:05,408 --> 00:38:08,245
You had it too?

979
00:38:05,408 --> 00:38:08,245
Yeah, bro.

980
00:38:08,245 --> 00:38:10,580
I wish I never even heard of it.

981
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:13,625
It was like lighting

982
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:13,625
my whole head on fire.

983
00:38:13,625 --> 00:38:16,253
BADGER:

984
00:38:13,625 --> 00:38:16,253
Yeah. That stuff

985
00:38:13,625 --> 00:38:16,253
will burn you down.

986
00:38:16,253 --> 00:38:19,297
Only reason I have

987
00:38:16,253 --> 00:38:19,297
a hope in hell

988
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:21,883
is because it's long gone.

989
00:38:21,883 --> 00:38:23,593
That's the shame of it.

990
00:38:23,593 --> 00:38:26,638
BADGER:

991
00:38:23,593 --> 00:38:26,638
No, no, man. Don't tell me that.

992
00:38:26,638 --> 00:38:28,974
PETE:

993
00:38:26,638 --> 00:38:28,974
I hear it's back in town.

994
00:38:32,936 --> 00:38:35,521

995
00:38:32,936 --> 00:38:35,521
Stay strong.

996

997
00:38:35,521 --> 00:38:38,275
It's gonna be okay.

998
00:38:51,204 --> 00:38:55,416
MARIE:

999
00:38:51,204 --> 00:38:55,416
<i>I swear to God, I'll do it.</i>

1000
00:38:51,204 --> 00:38:55,416

I'll go to<i> Nightline.</i>

1003

I don't know if there's

1004
00:38:58,003 --> 00:39:00,088
<i>Nightline</i> anymore.

1005
00:39:00,088 --> 00:39:02,215
Doesn't matter.

1006
00:39:00,088 --> 00:39:02,215
They will all take it

1007
00:39:02,215 --> 00:39:05,010
and they will run with it,

1008
00:39:02,215 --> 00:39:05,010
because he is a hero

1009
00:39:05,010 --> 00:39:09,181
and he is not going to be

1010
00:39:05,010 --> 00:39:09,181
in a wheelchair at 43.

1011
00:39:11,141 --> 00:39:13,392
Jesus.

1012
00:39:15,228 --> 00:39:18,106
Listen, Marie.

1013
00:39:18,106 --> 00:39:20,399
I know Skyler's

1014
00:39:18,106 --> 00:39:20,399
already told you this,

1015
00:39:20,399 --> 00:39:24,154
but if there's ever

1016
00:39:20,399 --> 00:39:24,154
anything that you need,

1017
00:39:24,154 --> 00:39:25,780
anything at all...

1018
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:29,159
It's good to have you here.

1019
00:39:29,159 --> 00:39:32,162
Both of you.

1020
00:39:32,162 --> 00:39:36,875
I just wish there was

1021
00:39:32,162 --> 00:39:36,875
something more that we could do.

1022
00:39:43,381 --> 00:39:45,342
Walt.

1023
00:39:47,468 --> 00:39:51,181
We can always pay their bills.

1024
00:39:51,181 --> 00:39:54,433
MARIE:

1025
00:39:51,181 --> 00:39:54,433
Please, it's tens of thousands

1026
00:39:51,181 --> 00:39:54,433
of dollars.

1027
00:39:54,433 --> 00:39:55,977
We have the money,

1028
00:39:55,977 --> 00:39:58,313
more than enough.

1029
00:39:55,977 --> 00:39:58,313
Walt earned it.

1030
00:39:58,313 --> 00:40:00,523
Skyler.

1031
00:39:58,313 --> 00:40:00,523
SKYLER: I think Marie

1032
00:40:00,523 --> 00:40:02,150
should know the truth.

1033
00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:05,904
Skyler, I really don't think

1034
00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:05,904
this is a good idea.

1035
00:40:05,904 --> 00:40:08,948
I think that--

1036
00:40:05,904 --> 00:40:08,948
He earned it gambling.

1037
00:40:12,327 --> 00:40:16,206
Walt and I, uh...

1038
00:40:16,206 --> 00:40:18,750
we've had our problems lately.

1039
00:40:16,206 --> 00:40:18,750
You know that.

1040
00:40:20,752 --> 00:40:26,465
And, uh, what it all

1041
00:40:20,752 --> 00:40:26,465
came down to really

1042
00:40:26,465 --> 00:40:30,262
was money.

1043
00:40:30,262 --> 00:40:32,347
Pure and simple.

1044
00:40:32,347 --> 00:40:35,308
When Walt was diagnosed, it,

1045
00:40:32,347 --> 00:40:35,308
um...

1046
00:40:36,559 --> 00:40:39,729
it changed him.

1047
00:40:39,729 --> 00:40:43,149
And looking back, I don't think

1048
00:40:39,729 --> 00:40:43,149
I ever really understood

1049
00:40:43,149 --> 00:40:46,027
what it was

1050
00:40:43,149 --> 00:40:46,027
that he was going through.

1051
00:40:46,027 --> 00:40:48,863
It was more

1052
00:40:46,027 --> 00:40:48,863
than facing death.

1053
00:40:48,863 --> 00:40:52,325
It was knowing that he was gonna

1054
00:40:48,863 --> 00:40:52,325
leave behind...

1055
00:40:53,910 --> 00:40:57,080
...nothing.

1056
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:59,165
And so that's how

1057
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:59,165
this all started.

1058
00:40:59,165 --> 00:41:01,918
For better or worse,

1059
00:41:01,918 --> 00:41:04,296
he wanted to provide.

1060
00:41:04,296 --> 00:41:08,883
And so he paid his medical bills

1061
00:41:08,883 --> 00:41:12,720
the only way he knew how.

1062
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:15,265
I thought that Elliot

1063
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:15,265
and Gretchen

1064
00:41:15,265 --> 00:41:16,724
paid for your treatment.

1065
00:41:16,724 --> 00:41:19,018
Yeah, I thought so too.

1066
00:41:19,018 --> 00:41:22,521
The truth is he never took

1067
00:41:19,018 --> 00:41:22,521
their money. Not a dime.

1068
00:41:22,521 --> 00:41:27,860
He was too proud to take what

1069
00:41:22,521 --> 00:41:27,860
he considered to be charity.

1070
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:29,362
Isn't that right?

1071
00:41:32,907 --> 00:41:37,578
So he put his mind

1072
00:41:32,907 --> 00:41:37,578
to it and...

1073
00:41:39,414 --> 00:41:43,835
Well, you know how Walt is.

1074
00:41:43,835 --> 00:41:45,878
He's a problem-solver.

1075
00:41:45,878 --> 00:41:51,259
And he read books and he did

1076
00:41:45,878 --> 00:41:51,259
a whole bunch of research,

1077
00:41:51,259 --> 00:41:56,306
and he came up

1078
00:41:51,259 --> 00:41:56,306
with this system.

1079
00:41:56,306 --> 00:41:58,599
A system?

1080
00:41:58,599 --> 00:42:02,354
A system for counting cards

1081
00:41:58,599 --> 00:42:02,354
in blackjack.

1082
00:42:02,354 --> 00:42:06,149
W-What do you mean,

1083
00:42:02,354 --> 00:42:06,149
like<i> Rain Man?</i>

1084
00:42:06,149 --> 00:42:09,152
Well, I don't pretend

1085
00:42:06,149 --> 00:42:09,152
to understand,

1086
00:42:09,152 --> 00:42:10,445
you know, all the details,

1087
00:42:10,445 --> 00:42:12,197
but he was convinced

1088
00:42:12,197 --> 00:42:16,242
that if he put enough money

1089
00:42:12,197 --> 00:42:16,242
into it, he'd have a--

1090
00:42:16,242 --> 00:42:18,244
God, what is it?

1091
00:42:18,244 --> 00:42:20,913
A statistical edge?

1092
00:42:22,790 --> 00:42:25,335
Yes, statistical--

1093
00:42:25,335 --> 00:42:27,170
So--

1094
00:42:25,335 --> 00:42:27,170
Um, yeah.

1095
00:42:27,170 --> 00:42:29,088
So he,

1096
00:42:27,170 --> 00:42:29,088
every spare minute,

1097
00:42:29,088 --> 00:42:31,883
Walt was at some

1098
00:42:29,088 --> 00:42:31,883
card table somewhere.

1099
00:42:31,883 --> 00:42:34,010
And at first he went

1100
00:42:31,883 --> 00:42:34,010
to the casinos,

1101
00:42:34,010 --> 00:42:35,594
but then he realized that--

But then he realized

1105
00:42:41,309 --> 00:42:44,354
that the casinos report

1140
00:43:58,677 --> 00:44:01,514
that as soon as he got

1141
00:43:58,677 --> 00:44:01,514

00:44:23,911 --> 00:44:26,747
we have the money.

1153
00:44:26,747 --> 00:44:30,209
No more gambling.

1154
00:44:31,419 --> 00:44:33,712
But we have the money.

1155
00:44:35,214 --> 00:44:40,178
How much money?

1156
00:44:40,178 --> 00:44:41,638
Walt?

1157
00:44:44,223 --> 00:44:46,851
Uh...

1158
00:44:46,851 --> 00:44:48,811
Well...

1159
00:44:53,941 --> 00:44:55,943
it's into seven figures.

1160
00:44:55,943 --> 00:44:58,029
Oh.

1161
00:44:58,029 --> 00:45:00,323
MARIE:

1162
00:44:58,029 --> 00:45:00,323
Holy Mary, mother of God.

1163
00:45:00,323 --> 00:45:03,826
What can I say?

1164
00:45:03,826 --> 00:45:07,205
I did very well.

1165
00:45:07,205 --> 00:45:09,790
Marie,

1166
00:45:09,790 --> 00:45:13,378
you will take our money.

1167
00:45:14,337 --> 00:45:17,965
Use it to take care of Hank.

1168
00:45:17,965 --> 00:45:22,428
Please.

1169
00:45:17,965 --> 00:45:22,428
Marie, let us help.

1170
00:45:24,347 --> 00:45:28,017
Does Walt, Jr. know about this?

1171
00:45:24,347 --> 00:45:28,017
Absolutely not.

1172
00:45:28,017 --> 00:45:30,186
And I need to keep it that way.

1173
00:45:30,186 --> 00:45:33,356
And Hank, okay? Hank's got

1174
00:45:30,186 --> 00:45:33,356
enough on his mind right now.

1175
00:45:33,356 --> 00:45:35,316
Can we please keep

1176
00:45:33,356 --> 00:45:35,316
this between us?

1177
00:45:35,316 --> 00:45:36,942
Yeah. Yeah, I--

1178
00:45:36,942 --> 00:45:39,945
Yeah, I just--

1179
00:45:36,942 --> 00:45:39,945
I need to--

1180
00:45:39,945 --> 00:45:44,325
Yeah, okay. We'll talk

1181
00:45:39,945 --> 00:45:44,325
about it later.

1182
00:45:44,325 --> 00:45:47,870
How did you

1183
00:45:44,325 --> 00:45:47,870
come up with that?

1184
00:45:47,870 --> 00:45:51,040
I mean, where did

1185
00:45:47,870 --> 00:45:51,040
you possibly--?

1186
00:45:52,584 --> 00:45:55,127
I learned from the best.

1187
00:46:00,425 --> 00:46:03,386
Somehow,

1188
00:46:03,386 --> 00:46:08,224
something tells me that Hank

1189
00:46:03,386 --> 00:46:08,224
is here because of you.

1190
00:46:08,224 --> 00:46:12,937
And I'm not forgetting that.

1191
00:46:18,192 --> 00:46:19,902
