00:16:40,207 --> 00:16:42,836
You know damn well we're gonna

386
00:16:40,207 --> 00:16:42,836
throw you a big party.

387
00:16:42,836 --> 00:16:45,004
Damn straight.

388
00:16:42,836 --> 00:16:45,004
We're talking a blowout.

389
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:54,221
Outstanding

390
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:54,221
police work, Hank.

391
00:16:54,221 --> 00:16:56,557
If only I'd listened.

392
00:16:56,557 --> 00:16:59,435
But I guess

393
00:16:56,557 --> 00:16:59,435
the damage was done.

394
00:17:01,228 --> 00:17:03,898
It's not right,

395
00:17:01,228 --> 00:17:03,898
them putting this on you.

396
00:17:06,275 --> 00:17:09,612
Somebody's gotta

397
00:17:06,275 --> 00:17:09,612
go under the bus.

398
00:17:09,612 --> 00:17:11,781
Ramey's a good man.

399
00:17:11,781 --> 00:17:14,200
He'll do right by you.

400
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:17,244
Besides, this office

401
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:17,244
practically runs itself.

402
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:20,331
Bullshit it does.

403
00:17:21,415 --> 00:17:23,376
Sir.

404
00:17:26,754 --> 00:17:29,924
What's with that APD thing?

405
00:17:26,754 --> 00:17:29,924
The electromagnets?

406
00:17:29,924 --> 00:17:31,592
They're thinking

407
00:17:29,924 --> 00:17:31,592
it's about Fring's laptop.

408
00:17:31,592 --> 00:17:33,636
Turns out a couple of days

409
00:17:31,592 --> 00:17:33,636
before it happened,

410
00:17:33,636 --> 00:17:36,806
desk sergeant gets this phone

411
00:17:33,636 --> 00:17:36,806
call from a "postal inspector,"

412
00:17:36,806 --> 00:17:38,265
quote, unquote,

413
00:17:38,265 --> 00:17:39,809
wanting to know

414
00:17:38,265 --> 00:17:39,809
where they keep the thing.

415
00:17:39,809 --> 00:17:43,270
And he told them?

416
00:17:39,809 --> 00:17:43,270
Jesus.

417
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:45,314
Anything left

418
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:45,314
of the laptop?

419
00:17:45,314 --> 00:17:48,026
(SCOFFS)

420
00:17:45,314 --> 00:17:48,026
Do we look that lucky?

421
00:17:48,026 --> 00:17:51,362
You know, I sneaked a peek

422
00:17:48,026 --> 00:17:51,362
before APD took it out of

423
00:17:48,026 --> 00:17:51,362
Fring's office.

424
00:17:51,362 --> 00:17:53,280
The whole thing

425
00:17:51,362 --> 00:17:53,280
was encrypted.

426
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,950
They wouldn't have got

427
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,950
anything anyway, but...

428
00:17:58,369 --> 00:18:01,330
So Hector Salamanca

429
00:17:58,369 --> 00:18:01,330
killed Fring.

430
00:18:02,415 --> 00:18:04,584
But who gave Salamanca

431
00:18:02,415 --> 00:18:04,584
the bomb?

432
00:18:04,584 --> 00:18:07,253
(SIGHS) Whole lot

433
00:18:04,584 --> 00:18:07,253
of questions

434
00:18:07,253 --> 00:18:09,463
and not much

435
00:18:07,253 --> 00:18:09,463
in the way of answers.

436
00:18:09,463 --> 00:18:10,840
Yet.

437
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:13,885
The APD did find

438
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:13,885
some of Fring's financials.

439
00:18:15,219 --> 00:18:17,388
That just might

440
00:18:15,219 --> 00:18:17,388
lead to something.

441
00:18:21,475 --> 00:18:23,310
I had him out

442
00:18:21,475 --> 00:18:23,310
to my house.

443
00:18:24,687 --> 00:18:26,064
4th of July.

444
00:18:26,064 --> 00:18:28,524
We cooked

445
00:18:26,064 --> 00:18:28,524
out in the backyard.

446
00:18:28,524 --> 00:18:32,737
My son shucked the corn.

447
00:18:28,524 --> 00:18:32,737
My daughter cut up potatoes.

448
00:18:32,737 --> 00:18:34,781
Fring brought sea bass.

449
00:18:34,781 --> 00:18:36,449
Every time

450
00:18:34,781 --> 00:18:36,449
I grill it now,

451
00:18:36,449 --> 00:18:40,036
I make a little foil pouch,

452
00:18:36,449 --> 00:18:40,036
just like he showed me.

453
00:18:40,036 --> 00:18:42,789
That whole night,

454
00:18:40,036 --> 00:18:42,789
we were laughing,

455
00:18:42,789 --> 00:18:45,124
telling stories,

456
00:18:42,789 --> 00:18:45,124
drinking wine.

457
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:50,337
And he's somebody else

458
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:50,337
completely.

459
00:18:51,505 --> 00:18:53,967
Right in front of me.

460
00:18:55,718 --> 00:18:58,262
Right under my nose.

461
00:19:29,127 --> 00:19:31,545
Hi.

462
00:19:29,127 --> 00:19:31,545
What can I get you?

463
00:19:31,545 --> 00:19:33,380
Just tea, please.

464
00:19:31,545 --> 00:19:33,380
Chamomile.

465
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:35,133
Oh, sorry.

466
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:35,133
We don't have chamomile tea.

467
00:19:35,133 --> 00:19:38,302
Then some sort of bergamot,

468
00:19:35,133 --> 00:19:38,302
provided it's not Earl Grey.

469
00:19:38,302 --> 00:19:39,929
I like soy milk

470
00:19:38,302 --> 00:19:39,929
instead of dairy.

471
00:19:39,929 --> 00:19:43,182
We don't have soy milk

472
00:19:39,929 --> 00:19:43,182
or any sort of bergamot.

473
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:45,935
Wow. You're really running me

474
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:45,935
through my paces here.

475
00:19:45,935 --> 00:19:47,145
Uh-huh.

476
00:19:47,145 --> 00:19:49,563
Well, English Breakfast,

477
00:19:47,145 --> 00:19:49,563
I guess.

478
00:19:49,563 --> 00:19:50,940
We have Lipton's.

479
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:53,985
That's pretty much

480
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:53,985
all we have.

481
00:19:55,653 --> 00:19:57,905
I would like a cup of

482
00:19:55,653 --> 00:19:57,905
hot water, filtered,

483
00:19:57,905 --> 00:19:59,365
if possible,

484
00:19:57,905 --> 00:19:59,365
and a single slice of lemon.

485
00:19:59,365 --> 00:20:01,575
And I'm assuming

486
00:19:59,365 --> 00:20:01,575
you don't have Stevia?

487
00:20:01,575 --> 00:20:04,453
Never mind.

488
00:20:01,575 --> 00:20:04,453
I brought my own.

489
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:10,710
You coming to me,

490
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:10,710
or am I coming to you?

491
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:13,754
Face forward.

492
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:13,754
We'll talk like this.

493
00:20:15,506 --> 00:20:17,633
I guess

494
00:20:15,506 --> 00:20:17,633
I'm coming to you.

495
00:20:18,592 --> 00:20:20,178
Ohh.

496
00:20:21,554 --> 00:20:22,889
Mmm.

497
00:20:28,853 --> 00:20:31,105
Take a breath,

498
00:20:28,853 --> 00:20:31,105
will you?

499
00:20:31,105 --> 00:20:34,067
This place is safe.

500
00:20:31,105 --> 00:20:34,067
No one's gonna see you here.

501
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:37,195
My God!

502
00:20:37,195 --> 00:20:39,655
Duane, this is so...

503
00:20:37,195 --> 00:20:39,655
Thank you.

504
00:20:39,655 --> 00:20:41,615
How did I not see you

505
00:20:39,655 --> 00:20:41,615
sitting back there?

506
00:20:41,615 --> 00:20:43,242
So weird.

507
00:20:41,615 --> 00:20:43,242
(CHUCKLES)

508
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:45,995
You want anything else,

509
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:45,995
Mike?

510
00:20:45,995 --> 00:20:47,872
No.

511
00:20:47,872 --> 00:20:50,332
I'm good, Fran.

512
00:20:47,872 --> 00:20:50,332
Thanks.

513
00:20:53,878 --> 00:20:56,463
Now,

514
00:20:56,463 --> 00:20:58,925
how about

515
00:20:56,463 --> 00:20:58,925
we lose the sunglasses?

516
00:20:58,925 --> 00:21:01,594
I feel like I'm talking

517
00:20:58,925 --> 00:21:01,594
to Jackie Onassis here.

518
00:21:05,389 --> 00:21:07,141
There you go.

519
00:21:08,517 --> 00:21:11,979
Breathe in,

520
00:21:08,517 --> 00:21:11,979
breathe out.

521
00:21:11,979 --> 00:21:15,233
Drink your whatever.

522
00:21:24,617 --> 00:21:26,619
Who killed Gus?

523
00:21:26,619 --> 00:21:29,872
Haven't I told you

524
00:21:26,619 --> 00:21:29,872
not to worry about that?

525
00:21:29,872 --> 00:21:33,417
Now, what do you want from me,

526
00:21:29,872 --> 00:21:33,417
and why is it so important?

527
00:21:36,587 --> 00:21:38,172
What's this?

528
00:21:38,172 --> 00:21:39,924
A list of 11 names.

529
00:21:39,924 --> 00:21:41,508
Okay.

530
00:21:41,508 --> 00:21:43,302
You know them all.

531
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:47,140
I do.

532
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:49,475
Those 11 men... And I

533
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:49,475
think you know this, Mike.

534
00:21:49,475 --> 00:21:51,978
Those 11 could sink us,

535
00:21:49,475 --> 00:21:51,978
you and me both.

536
00:21:51,978 --> 00:21:53,938
Where are we going

537
00:21:51,978 --> 00:21:53,938
with this, Lydia?

538
00:21:53,938 --> 00:21:56,190
No specific.

539
00:21:53,938 --> 00:21:56,190
I'm just pointing out facts.

540
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:58,442
These men... Your men...

541
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:58,442
Yours and Gus's...

542
00:21:58,442 --> 00:22:00,319
These men were on

543
00:21:58,442 --> 00:22:00,319
the payroll, very publicly.

544
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:02,529
They trace back to Pollos

545
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:02,529
and the laundry.

546
00:22:02,529 --> 00:22:04,531
They trace back to Madrigal,

547
00:22:02,529 --> 00:22:04,531
and they're gonna get

548
00:22:02,529 --> 00:22:04,531
picked up by the police.

549
00:22:04,531 --> 00:22:05,825
And when they do,

550
00:22:04,531 --> 00:22:05,825
when they get picked up

551
00:22:05,825 --> 00:22:07,785
and threatened

552
00:22:05,825 --> 00:22:07,785
with prosecution,

553
00:22:07,785 --> 00:22:09,536
and there's only one way out

554
00:22:07,785 --> 00:22:09,536
for them, they're gonna...

555
00:22:09,536 --> 00:22:12,039
And I'm not saying

556
00:22:09,536 --> 00:22:12,039
all of them, okay?

557
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:14,041
All it's gonna take is

558
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:14,041
two or three, or even one.

559
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:16,460
But there's always

560
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:16,460
a weak link somewhere.

561
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:19,130
But they're gonna talk.

562
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:19,130
At least one of them's

563
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:19,130
gonna talk about you,

564
00:22:19,130 --> 00:22:21,340
about me, and that's all

565
00:22:19,130 --> 00:22:21,340
it's gonna take.

566
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:24,677
These are the 11 I know of,

567
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:24,677
but I'd love your input.

568
00:22:24,677 --> 00:22:26,971
I never met your chemist,

569
00:22:24,677 --> 00:22:26,971
for instance.

570
00:22:26,971 --> 00:22:29,765
I'd love your input.

571
00:22:33,311 --> 00:22:36,354
You want me to kill

572
00:22:33,311 --> 00:22:36,354
every man on that list?

573
00:22:36,354 --> 00:22:39,066
Wow. That's a leap,

574
00:22:39,066 --> 00:22:41,235
what you just, uh...

575
00:22:41,235 --> 00:22:44,488
No, I didn't say that.

576
00:22:44,488 --> 00:22:48,201
But if you think

577
00:22:44,488 --> 00:22:48,201
that'd be wise...

578
00:22:48,201 --> 00:22:49,952
(SIGHS)

579
00:22:51,871 --> 00:22:53,580
You're scared,

580
00:22:51,871 --> 00:22:53,580
aren't you?

581
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:55,499
Yeah.

582
00:22:55,499 --> 00:22:56,917
You're very upset,

583
00:22:56,917 --> 00:23:00,462
which I'm gonna factor

584
00:22:56,917 --> 00:23:00,462
into my response here.

585
00:23:00,462 --> 00:23:04,591
These are my guys,

586
00:23:00,462 --> 00:23:04,591
and they are solid.

587
00:23:04,591 --> 00:23:07,220
Understand?

588
00:23:04,591 --> 00:23:07,220
What about Chow

589
00:23:04,591 --> 00:23:07,220
at the warehouse?

590
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:09,555
Didn't one time you have

591
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:09,555
to shoot him through the hand?

592
00:23:09,555 --> 00:23:11,557
You think that didn't

593
00:23:09,555 --> 00:23:11,557
stick in his memory?

594
00:23:11,557 --> 00:23:13,059
What about Dennis

595
00:23:11,557 --> 00:23:13,059
at the laundry?

596
00:23:13,059 --> 00:23:15,061
They're sure

597
00:23:13,059 --> 00:23:15,061
to pick him up.

598
00:23:15,061 --> 00:23:17,646
They already have.

599
00:23:15,061 --> 00:23:17,646
They picked him up last night.

600
00:23:18,814 --> 00:23:21,359
My guys are solid.

601
00:23:21,359 --> 00:23:23,903
I vetted them

602
00:23:21,359 --> 00:23:23,903
with great care,

603
00:23:23,903 --> 00:23:26,322
and Fring made sure

604
00:23:23,903 --> 00:23:26,322
they were well compensated

605
00:23:26,322 --> 00:23:28,574
in the event

606
00:23:26,322 --> 00:23:28,574
of a situation such as this.

607
00:23:28,574 --> 00:23:30,701
They're paid

608
00:23:28,574 --> 00:23:30,701
to stand up to the heat,

609
00:23:30,701 --> 00:23:34,538
keep their mouths shut,

610
00:23:30,701 --> 00:23:34,538
no matter what.

611
00:23:34,538 --> 00:23:37,791
And they will.

612
00:23:37,791 --> 00:23:40,418
Now, I don't know

613
00:23:37,791 --> 00:23:40,418
what kind of movies

614
00:23:37,791 --> 00:23:40,418
you've been watching,

615
00:23:40,418 --> 00:23:43,297
but here in the real world,

616
00:23:40,418 --> 00:23:43,297
we don't kill 11 people

617
00:23:43,297 --> 00:23:45,841
as some kind of

618
00:23:43,297 --> 00:23:45,841
prophylactic measure.

619
00:23:47,176 --> 00:23:48,928
Look at me

620
00:23:48,928 --> 00:23:51,305
and say you understand.

621
00:23:52,139 --> 00:23:53,933
I understand.

622
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:56,434
I get it.

623
00:23:56,434 --> 00:23:58,645
So we're off

624
00:23:56,434 --> 00:23:58,645
that very silly idea?

625
00:24:00,773 --> 00:24:02,733
Good.

626
00:24:11,409 --> 00:24:13,744
Drink your hot water.

627
00:24:24,462 --> 00:24:27,007
I gotta go.

628
00:24:27,007 --> 00:24:28,466
Did you have enough?

629
00:24:28,466 --> 00:24:30,261
Yeah. I'm good.

630
00:24:30,261 --> 00:24:31,762
Okay.

00:24:31,762 --> 00:24:33,180
(QUIETLY)

632
00:24:31,762 --> 00:24:33,180
Bye-bye.

633
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:34,432
Bye.

634
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:34,432
Bye.

635
00:24:34,432 --> 00:24:36,516
Bye, big brother.

636
00:24:34,432 --> 00:24:36,516
(CHUCKLES)

637
00:24:36,516 --> 00:24:38,269
Say bye to Mom for me.

638
00:24:39,477 --> 00:24:41,981
I will.

639
00:24:39,477 --> 00:24:41,981
Have a good day.

640
00:24:41,981 --> 00:24:43,441
You, too.

Hey.

00:25:01,334 --> 00:25:04,253
The car wash opens

648

in 15 minutes.

649
00:25:04,253 --> 00:25:07,340
Mariano can open

650
00:25:04,253 --> 00:25:07,340
for me today.

651
00:25:11,385 --> 00:25:14,847
Hey, how about

652
00:25:11,385 --> 00:25:14,847
you get up, huh?

653
00:25:18,184 --> 00:25:20,644
Come on.

654
00:25:20,644 --> 00:25:22,980
A shower

655
00:25:20,644 --> 00:25:22,980
will feel good.

656
00:25:39,413 --> 00:25:41,539
Hey, Chow.

657
00:25:43,334 --> 00:25:45,336
How you holding up?

658
00:25:45,336 --> 00:25:47,505
Okay.

659
00:25:47,505 --> 00:25:50,799
You know, they...

660
00:25:47,505 --> 00:25:50,799
They...

661
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:52,468
They talked to me.

662
00:25:52,468 --> 00:25:55,179
You can't smoke

663
00:25:52,468 --> 00:25:55,179
in here, Chow.

664
00:26:15,949 --> 00:26:17,617
HANK:

665
00:26:15,949 --> 00:26:17,617
<i>Thanks for coming down.</i>

666
00:26:17,617 --> 00:26:20,371
Have a seat, Mr., uh,

667
00:26:17,617 --> 00:26:20,371
Ehrmantraut.

668
00:26:20,371 --> 00:26:23,123
Am I, uh,

669
00:26:20,371 --> 00:26:23,123
saying that right?

670
00:26:23,123 --> 00:26:25,418
Close enough.

671
00:26:25,418 --> 00:26:28,586
So, once more,

672
00:26:25,418 --> 00:26:28,586
you're waiving your right

673
00:26:25,418 --> 00:26:28,586
to have an attorney present?

674
00:26:28,586 --> 00:26:30,381
Correct.

675
00:26:30,381 --> 00:26:32,632
Could you state that

676
00:26:30,381 --> 00:26:32,632
to the camera, please?

677
00:26:32,632 --> 00:26:35,719
I'm waiving my right

678
00:26:32,632 --> 00:26:35,719
to have an attorney present.

679
00:26:35,719 --> 00:26:39,098
Uh, okay, then.

680
00:26:35,719 --> 00:26:39,098
We just have a few questions.

681
00:26:39,098 --> 00:26:42,435
You're currently employed

682
00:26:39,098 --> 00:26:42,435
by the Pollos Hermanos chain.

683
00:26:42,435 --> 00:26:44,019
Is that correct?

684
00:26:42,435 --> 00:26:44,019
Yes, I am.

685
00:26:44,019 --> 00:26:45,271
And what do

686
00:26:44,019 --> 00:26:45,271
you do there?

687
00:26:45,271 --> 00:26:46,522
Corporate security.

688
00:26:46,522 --> 00:26:48,941
Corporate security.

689
00:26:46,522 --> 00:26:48,941
Yeah.

690
00:26:48,941 --> 00:26:52,445
What's that? Like, uh,

691
00:26:48,941 --> 00:26:52,445
guarding the special sauce?

692
00:26:52,445 --> 00:26:55,030
I conduct employee

693
00:26:52,445 --> 00:26:55,030
background checks.

694
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:57,657
I oversee

695
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:57,657
loss prevention.

696
00:26:57,657 --> 00:27:01,495
At a fast-food restaurant,

697
00:26:57,657 --> 00:27:01,495
that's a full-time job?

698
00:27:01,495 --> 00:27:04,622
We have 14 locations.

699
00:27:01,495 --> 00:27:04,622
So, yes, it's a full-time job.

700
00:27:04,622 --> 00:27:06,333
Yeah, well,

701
00:27:04,622 --> 00:27:06,333
(CHUCKLES)

702
00:27:06,333 --> 00:27:08,626
If I were you, I'd start

703
00:27:06,333 --> 00:27:08,626
sending out those resumes.

704
00:27:08,626 --> 00:27:12,047
It says here you're

705
00:27:08,626 --> 00:27:12,047
a private investigator?

706
00:27:12,047 --> 00:27:13,215
Where you licensed?

707
00:27:13,215 --> 00:27:15,175
New Mexico,

708
00:27:13,215 --> 00:27:15,175
Arizona, Utah.

709
00:27:15,175 --> 00:27:17,094
Every state

710
00:27:15,175 --> 00:27:17,094
where we operate.

711
00:27:17,094 --> 00:27:20,306
Colorado? You have some

712
00:27:17,094 --> 00:27:20,306
restaurants there, right?

713
00:27:20,306 --> 00:27:22,182
Colorado doesn't

714
00:27:20,306 --> 00:27:22,182
require licensure.

715
00:27:22,182 --> 00:27:24,101
You licensed

716
00:27:22,182 --> 00:27:24,101
to carry a firearm?

717
00:27:24,101 --> 00:27:25,685
Concealed carry?

718
00:27:24,101 --> 00:27:25,685
Yes, I am.

719
00:27:25,685 --> 00:27:27,480
Which states?

720
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:30,232
It'd be quicker to mention

721
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:30,232
the states in which I'm not.

722
00:27:30,232 --> 00:27:31,984
And if we pulled

723
00:27:30,232 --> 00:27:31,984
your C.C.P.'s,

724
00:27:31,984 --> 00:27:33,902
everything would be

725
00:27:31,984 --> 00:27:33,902
in order?

726
00:27:33,902 --> 00:27:36,489
I'm guessing

727
00:27:33,902 --> 00:27:36,489
you've already done that,

728
00:27:33,902 --> 00:27:36,489
so you tell me.

729
00:27:39,032 --> 00:27:41,743
You strike me

730
00:27:39,032 --> 00:27:41,743
as a former cop.

731
00:27:41,743 --> 00:27:43,287
Am I right?

732
00:27:44,662 --> 00:27:46,373
Where at?

733
00:27:49,335 --> 00:27:50,794
Philadelphia.

734
00:27:50,794 --> 00:27:53,339
Philly.

735
00:27:50,794 --> 00:27:53,339
(CHUCKLES)

736
00:27:53,339 --> 00:27:54,798
The city of brotherly love.

737
00:27:54,798 --> 00:27:58,511
Turns out we, uh,

738
00:27:54,798 --> 00:27:58,511
we know some folks there,

739
00:27:58,511 --> 00:28:01,472
and they told us

740
00:27:58,511 --> 00:28:01,472
that your tenure

741
00:27:58,511 --> 00:28:01,472
as a police officer

742
00:28:01,472 --> 00:28:05,683
ended somewhat,

743
00:28:01,472 --> 00:28:05,683
uh, dramatically?

744
00:28:05,683 --> 00:28:07,685
You wanna talk

745
00:28:05,683 --> 00:28:07,685
about that?

746
00:28:07,685 --> 00:28:09,146
Not particularly.

747
00:28:09,146 --> 00:28:11,273
Yeah, me neither.

748
00:28:12,608 --> 00:28:14,860
See, I'm more interested

749
00:28:12,608 --> 00:28:14,860
in why Gus Fring

750
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:17,321
decided to put

751
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:17,321
a guy like you

752
00:28:17,321 --> 00:28:19,615
in charge of

753
00:28:17,321 --> 00:28:19,615
his corporate security.

754
00:28:19,615 --> 00:28:23,994
I mean,

755
00:28:19,615 --> 00:28:23,994
given your history

756
00:28:23,994 --> 00:28:27,540
doing background checks

757
00:28:23,994 --> 00:28:27,540
on pimple-faced fry cooks.

758
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:29,375
Seems like overkill.

759
00:28:29,375 --> 00:28:31,793
What else you do

760
00:28:29,375 --> 00:28:31,793
for Fring?

761
00:28:31,793 --> 00:28:36,340
He must've needed help running

762
00:28:31,793 --> 00:28:36,340
that drug empire of his, no?

763
00:28:37,466 --> 00:28:38,884
Drug empire?

764
00:28:38,884 --> 00:28:41,595
First I'm hearing

765
00:28:38,884 --> 00:28:41,595
about that.

766
00:28:41,595 --> 00:28:43,597
I don't know anything

767
00:28:41,595 --> 00:28:43,597
about that.

768
00:28:43,597 --> 00:28:46,517
Hey, man, we have a guy that

769
00:28:43,597 --> 00:28:46,517
could put you in that

770
00:28:43,597 --> 00:28:46,517
underground lab,

771
00:28:46,517 --> 00:28:47,976
and he'll testify to it.

772
00:28:47,976 --> 00:28:51,230
So from here on out,

773
00:28:47,976 --> 00:28:51,230
this can go hard or easy.

774
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:53,065
So what's it gonna be?

775
00:29:03,325 --> 00:29:06,036
Forget your handcuffs?

776
00:29:06,036 --> 00:29:07,371
I'm confused.

777
00:29:07,371 --> 00:29:09,873
Am I under arrest here,

778
00:29:07,371 --> 00:29:09,873
or am I not?

779
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:18,757
You wanna state that

780
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:18,757
for the camera?

781
00:29:22,553 --> 00:29:26,932
You are not under arrest,

782
00:29:22,553 --> 00:29:26,932
currently.

783
00:29:26,932 --> 00:29:29,809
Agents, do you have

784
00:29:26,932 --> 00:29:29,809
any more questions for me?

785
00:29:29,809 --> 00:29:32,854
Because you've got me

786
00:29:29,809 --> 00:29:32,854
very stirred up

787
00:29:32,854 --> 00:29:34,732
with all these

788
00:29:32,854 --> 00:29:34,732
false accusations.

789
00:29:34,732 --> 00:29:37,776
If I'm not under arrest,

790
00:29:34,732 --> 00:29:37,776
I'd prefer to leave.

791
00:29:37,776 --> 00:29:40,028
Oh, well...

792
00:29:40,028 --> 00:29:41,530
Uh-huh.

793
00:29:44,283 --> 00:29:48,036
And I suppose

794
00:29:44,283 --> 00:29:48,036
we could talk about

795
00:29:44,283 --> 00:29:48,036
the two million dollars

796
00:29:48,036 --> 00:29:50,956
in your

797
00:29:48,036 --> 00:29:50,956
granddaughter's name.

798
00:29:54,042 --> 00:29:56,128
Yeah. It seems, uh,

799
00:29:56,128 --> 00:29:58,672
Fring had all these

800
00:29:56,128 --> 00:29:58,672
secret offshore accounts

801
00:29:58,672 --> 00:30:00,006
that he would

802
00:29:58,672 --> 00:30:00,006
deposit money into.

803
00:30:00,006 --> 00:30:01,967
Like, uh, well,

804
00:30:00,006 --> 00:30:01,967
an even dozen of them.

805
00:30:01,967 --> 00:30:03,260
And they're all

806
00:30:01,967 --> 00:30:03,260
in the names

807
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:04,720
of certain people

808
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:04,720
on his payroll.

809
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:08,014
There was the, uh,

810
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:08,014
the manager of the laundry,

811
00:30:08,014 --> 00:30:12,185
um, a couple guys from the

812
00:30:08,014 --> 00:30:12,185
Pollos distribution center.

813
00:30:12,185 --> 00:30:16,982
There was the owner

814
00:30:12,185 --> 00:30:16,982
of a chemical warehouse,

815
00:30:12,185 --> 00:30:16,982
a bunch of others.

816
00:30:16,982 --> 00:30:19,693
You know, guys that must've been

817
00:30:16,982 --> 00:30:19,693
getting paid off the books.

818
00:30:19,693 --> 00:30:25,783
Anyway, one of the names

819
00:30:19,693 --> 00:30:25,783
was Kaylee Ehrmantraut.

820
00:30:27,284 --> 00:30:31,622
Ten years old

821
00:30:27,284 --> 00:30:31,622
and just cute as a button.

822
00:30:31,622 --> 00:30:36,001
Yeah. Two million and change

823
00:30:31,622 --> 00:30:36,001
we found on deposit for her.

824
00:30:36,001 --> 00:30:37,419
Way more

825
00:30:36,001 --> 00:30:37,419
than anybody else.

826
00:30:37,419 --> 00:30:39,672
Now, my partner here,

827
00:30:39,672 --> 00:30:41,965
he took one look at that

828
00:30:39,672 --> 00:30:41,965
and said, "Shit, man.

829
00:30:41,965 --> 00:30:45,344
"This fifth-grade girl

830
00:30:41,965 --> 00:30:45,344
is the muscle behind

831
00:30:41,965 --> 00:30:45,344
Fring's entire operation."

832
00:30:45,344 --> 00:30:48,388
I said, "Whoa, whoa.

833
00:30:45,344 --> 00:30:48,388
Hey, partner, slow down there.

834
00:30:48,388 --> 00:30:49,807
"Maybe it was actually

835
00:30:49,807 --> 00:30:52,434
"her dear old granddaddy."

836
00:30:54,353 --> 00:30:57,439
Impressive, no?

837
00:30:54,353 --> 00:30:57,439
That... (CLICKS TONGUE)

838
00:30:57,439 --> 00:30:59,107
level of insight?

839
00:31:00,317 --> 00:31:02,110
He's not impressed,

840
00:31:00,317 --> 00:31:02,110
Gomie.

841
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:05,781
Perhaps he's picturing

842
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:05,781
all that money going bye-bye.

843
00:31:05,781 --> 00:31:07,741
Yeah, well, I mean,

844
00:31:07,741 --> 00:31:11,745
the government's gonna take

845
00:31:07,741 --> 00:31:11,745
every last dollar, unless...

846
00:31:13,246 --> 00:31:16,333
Well, here's the thing,

847
00:31:13,246 --> 00:31:16,333
Mike... Or Michael?

848
00:31:16,333 --> 00:31:18,544
Mr. Ehrmantraut.

849
00:31:16,333 --> 00:31:18,544
Here's the thing, Mike.

850
00:31:18,544 --> 00:31:20,420
Lucky for you,

851
00:31:18,544 --> 00:31:20,420
you didn't touch that money.

852
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:23,507
I cannot say the same

853
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:23,507
for the other 11 on the list.

854
00:31:23,507 --> 00:31:25,759
One of your guys

855
00:31:23,507 --> 00:31:25,759
is gonna roll on you,

856
00:31:25,759 --> 00:31:28,053
and then we'll definitely

857
00:31:25,759 --> 00:31:28,053
remember the handcuffs.

858
00:31:28,053 --> 00:31:33,308
Now, before that day comes,

859
00:31:28,053 --> 00:31:33,308
you can do yourself a solid.

860
00:31:33,308 --> 00:31:36,061
You can tell us

861
00:31:33,308 --> 00:31:36,061
what you know,

862
00:31:36,061 --> 00:31:39,147
you can tell us

863
00:31:36,061 --> 00:31:39,147
who's still out there,

864
00:31:39,147 --> 00:31:41,316
and if we like your story,

865
00:31:43,026 --> 00:31:44,486
good things can happen.

866
00:31:44,486 --> 00:31:47,239
Kaylee might be able

867
00:31:44,486 --> 00:31:47,239
to keep some of that money.

868
00:31:47,239 --> 00:31:49,658
Maybe.

869
00:31:49,658 --> 00:31:51,284
HANK: So what do you say?

870
00:31:56,039 --> 00:31:58,291
I don't know anything

871
00:31:56,039 --> 00:31:58,291
about any money.

872
00:32:00,043 --> 00:32:02,962
I don't know

873
00:32:00,043 --> 00:32:02,962
what you're talking about.

874
00:32:13,139 --> 00:32:14,892
WALTER:

875
00:32:13,139 --> 00:32:14,892
First order of business

876
00:32:14,892 --> 00:32:17,060
is to find

877
00:32:14,892 --> 00:32:17,060
a new place to cook.

878
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:19,855
Before anyone says it,

879
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:19,855
no more RV's.

880
00:32:19,855 --> 00:32:23,149
I don't know. The crystal ship

881
00:32:19,855 --> 00:32:23,149
did pretty good for us.

882
00:32:23,149 --> 00:32:24,568
The "crystal ship"?

883
00:32:24,568 --> 00:32:27,070
Yeah.

884
00:32:24,568 --> 00:32:27,070
That's what I called it.

885
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:30,616
Well, I'll admit, it held

886
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:30,616
its own as a starter lab,

887
00:32:30,616 --> 00:32:33,076
but it was too dark,

888
00:32:30,616 --> 00:32:33,076
too small,

889
00:32:33,076 --> 00:32:36,329
not to mention it could've

890
00:32:33,076 --> 00:32:36,329
broken down at any moment.

891
00:32:36,329 --> 00:32:39,625
Saul, find us someplace

892
00:32:36,329 --> 00:32:39,625
safe from prying eyes.

893
00:32:39,625 --> 00:32:41,668
Security against detection

894
00:32:39,625 --> 00:32:41,668
is paramount.

895
00:32:41,668 --> 00:32:43,503
But I don't wanna

896
00:32:41,668 --> 00:32:43,503
drive too far.

897
00:32:43,503 --> 00:32:46,590
No more 50-mile treks

898
00:32:43,503 --> 00:32:46,590
to some Indian reservation.

899
00:32:46,590 --> 00:32:48,216
In town is trickier.

900
00:32:48,216 --> 00:32:51,261
I mean, you got a lot more

901
00:32:48,216 --> 00:32:51,261
of your prying eyes.

902
00:32:51,261 --> 00:32:55,265
If Gus can manage it,

903
00:32:51,261 --> 00:32:55,265
then so can we.

904
00:32:58,143 --> 00:33:00,938
Precursor.

905
00:32:58,143 --> 00:33:00,938
Where are we with that?

906
00:33:02,105 --> 00:33:04,107
Uh, we're good

907
00:33:02,105 --> 00:33:04,107
on everything

908
00:33:04,107 --> 00:33:07,861
except, uh,

909
00:33:04,107 --> 00:33:07,861
methylamine.

910
00:33:07,861 --> 00:33:09,738
No surprise.

911
00:33:09,738 --> 00:33:11,990
It's dry as hell

912
00:33:09,738 --> 00:33:11,990
out there.

913
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:14,284
What if we switched back

914
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:14,284
to a pseudo cook?

915
00:33:14,284 --> 00:33:16,536
Absolutely

916
00:33:14,284 --> 00:33:16,536
out of the question.

917
00:33:16,536 --> 00:33:19,331
Jesse, there is methylamine

918
00:33:16,536 --> 00:33:19,331
out there. I know it.

919
00:33:19,331 --> 00:33:21,416
Yeah, but what if

920
00:33:19,331 --> 00:33:21,416
there's not?

921
00:33:21,416 --> 00:33:23,251
Because there isn't.

922
00:33:23,251 --> 00:33:25,044
I mean, really.

923
00:33:25,044 --> 00:33:26,922
There is.

924
00:33:26,922 --> 00:33:29,633
Have faith.

925
00:33:29,633 --> 00:33:31,802
Can I...

926
00:33:29,633 --> 00:33:31,802
Can I offer a thought?

927
00:33:31,802 --> 00:33:32,970
Uh...

928
00:33:32,970 --> 00:33:36,055
Say a guy

929
00:33:32,970 --> 00:33:36,055
wins the lottery.

930
00:33:36,055 --> 00:33:37,850
Ten million bucks.

931
00:33:37,850 --> 00:33:40,853
The very next day, what's

932
00:33:37,850 --> 00:33:40,853
the one thing he does not do?

933
00:33:40,853 --> 00:33:43,647
He does not go buy another

934
00:33:40,853 --> 00:33:43,647
lottery ticket, right?

935
00:33:43,647 --> 00:33:47,734
He counts his lucky stars, and

936
00:33:43,647 --> 00:33:47,734
he sails off into the sunset,

937
00:33:47,734 --> 00:33:51,446
which, seems to me,

938
00:33:47,734 --> 00:33:51,446
and all due respect,

939
00:33:51,446 --> 00:33:54,449
some advice you two

940
00:33:51,446 --> 00:33:54,449
might take.

941
00:33:54,449 --> 00:33:57,452
What lottery

942
00:33:54,449 --> 00:33:57,452
did I win exactly?

943
00:33:57,452 --> 00:33:59,621
Hey, you're alive.

944
00:33:59,621 --> 00:34:02,290
I mean, as far as I'm concerned,

945
00:33:59,621 --> 00:34:02,290
that's the Irish sweepstakes.

946
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:04,501
I'm alive, and I'm broke.

947
00:34:04,501 --> 00:34:06,294
Counting the money

948
00:34:04,501 --> 00:34:06,294
that I owe Jesse,

949
00:34:06,294 --> 00:34:08,630
I'm about 40 grand

950
00:34:06,294 --> 00:34:08,630
in the hole.

951
00:34:08,630 --> 00:34:10,382
Does that seem like

952
00:34:08,630 --> 00:34:10,382
an acceptable

953
00:34:10,382 --> 00:34:12,551
stopping point to you?

954
00:34:10,382 --> 00:34:12,551
(SIGHS)

955
00:34:14,386 --> 00:34:16,763
There is gold

956
00:34:14,386 --> 00:34:16,763
in the streets,

957
00:34:16,763 --> 00:34:20,225
just waiting for someone

958
00:34:16,763 --> 00:34:20,225
to come and scoop it up.

959
00:34:20,225 --> 00:34:21,643
But me,

960
00:34:20,225 --> 00:34:21,643
I should quit now.

961
00:34:21,643 --> 00:34:23,645
Jesse, too,

962
00:34:21,643 --> 00:34:23,645
I suppose, huh?

963
00:34:25,271 --> 00:34:26,857
Wow.

964
00:34:26,857 --> 00:34:30,027
I got you

965
00:34:26,857 --> 00:34:30,027
this time, kid.

966
00:34:30,027 --> 00:34:33,405
And how come you get two,

967
00:34:30,027 --> 00:34:33,405
