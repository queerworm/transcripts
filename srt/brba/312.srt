Chrissakes, Marie, you don't say

385
00:15:15,498 --> 00:15:19,377
"knock, knock," you...like that.

386
00:15:19,377 --> 00:15:23,089
Well, I like saying it.

387
00:15:19,377 --> 00:15:23,089
Well, that's not the rules.

388
00:15:23,089 --> 00:15:25,007
Okay?

389
00:15:23,089 --> 00:15:25,007
You knock your way, groucho,

390
00:15:25,007 --> 00:15:26,217
I'll knock mine.

391
00:15:26,217 --> 00:15:28,219

394
00:15:31,013 --> 00:15:33,516
That's three in a row.

Hey,

408

409

412
00:15:57,916 --> 00:16:00,167
Oh, yeah? That's great.

413
00:16:00,167 --> 00:16:02,086
Yeah, I'm not so sure

414
00:16:00,167 --> 00:16:02,086
about that.

415
00:16:02,086 --> 00:16:04,464

416
00:16:02,086 --> 00:16:04,464
Why not?

417
00:16:04,464 --> 00:16:06,173
What? That's what they said.

418
00:16:06,173 --> 00:16:08,134
Because they want the room.

419
00:16:08,134 --> 00:16:10,970
They hit the sheets with Lysol,

420
00:16:08,134 --> 00:16:10,970
reset the meter,

421
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:12,597
and wheel the next slob in here.

422
00:16:12,597 --> 00:16:14,808
We went over this,

423
00:16:12,597 --> 00:16:14,808

426

Do I look well enough?

I can't move my legs. Got it?

430
00:16:29,363 --> 00:16:32,909
So people in wheelchairs

431
00:16:29,363 --> 00:16:32,909
should be in hospitals?

432
00:16:32,909 --> 00:16:38,205
What about people on crutches?

433
00:16:32,909 --> 00:16:38,205
Maybe I should be in here too.

434
00:16:38,205 --> 00:16:41,250
That what you're trying to say?

435
00:16:38,205 --> 00:16:41,250
That's exactly what I'm saying.

Deal, you little prick.

Oh, he promised.

Why didn't you tell me?

00:17:13,491 --> 00:17:16,202
Let's wait then.

Well, let's brainstorm.

You really think he's serious?

452
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:31,133
That's why I'm here, Saul.

Or try, at least.

456
00:17:35,304 --> 00:17:38,432
Okay, so, well, we pay him off.

457
00:17:38,432 --> 00:17:40,100
No, no, it's not about money.

458
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:42,311
It's about getting

459
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:42,311
him off the streets.

What if we, maybe--?

463
00:17:56,409 --> 00:17:58,786

You--?

465
00:18:01,455 --> 00:18:04,834
You want your criminal associate

466
00:18:01,455 --> 00:18:04,834
taken into police custody?

467
00:18:04,834 --> 00:18:07,503
No, now listen. I know--

468
00:18:04,834 --> 00:18:07,503
I know it sounds risky.

469
00:18:07,503 --> 00:18:08,796
It wouldn't be anything

470
00:18:08,796 --> 00:18:11,007
that would get him

471
00:18:08,796 --> 00:18:11,007
into real trouble,

472
00:18:11,007 --> 00:18:13,843

lead back to our business.

You're talking about

Then by the time he gets out,

492
00:18:42,038 --> 00:18:45,083
tempers have cooled

493
00:18:42,038 --> 00:18:45,083
