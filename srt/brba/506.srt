1
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:27,041
You guys didn't tell me this

2
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:27,041
stuff smells like cat piss.

3
00:03:42,973 --> 00:03:45,266
Man.

4
00:03:42,973 --> 00:03:45,266
Shit happens, huh?

5
00:03:45,266 --> 00:03:47,268
(GRUNTS)

6
00:03:50,355 --> 00:03:52,524
(♪♪♪)

7
00:04:08,415 --> 00:04:11,793
TODD:

8
00:04:08,415 --> 00:04:11,793
I mean, I'm sorry,

9
00:04:08,415 --> 00:04:11,793
but I had to do it.

10
00:04:11,793 --> 00:04:14,254
Obviously, I guess

11
00:04:11,793 --> 00:04:14,254
you see it different.

12
00:04:16,131 --> 00:04:18,133
Some of you.

13
00:04:16,131 --> 00:04:18,133
But I didn't see

14
00:04:16,131 --> 00:04:18,133
any other choice.

15
00:04:18,133 --> 00:04:19,718
I've been thinking

16
00:04:18,133 --> 00:04:19,718
about this all day,

17
00:04:19,718 --> 00:04:21,511
going over and over

18
00:04:19,718 --> 00:04:21,511
it in my head,

19
00:04:21,511 --> 00:04:23,513
and it was the only way.

20
00:04:21,511 --> 00:04:23,513
(SCOFFS)

21
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:27,893
Well, it's not like

22
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:27,893
I wanted to.

23
00:04:27,893 --> 00:04:29,811
The kid was on a dirt bike.

24
00:04:27,893 --> 00:04:29,811
I mean, he could've just...

25
00:04:29,811 --> 00:04:31,688
He could've just gunned it

26
00:04:29,811 --> 00:04:31,688
and been gone

27
00:04:31,688 --> 00:04:33,398
before we even

28
00:04:31,688 --> 00:04:33,398
had a chance to blink.

29
00:04:33,398 --> 00:04:34,942
We never would've been able

30
00:04:33,398 --> 00:04:34,942
to catch him.

31
00:04:34,942 --> 00:04:36,902
I was thinking on my feet.

32
00:04:34,942 --> 00:04:36,902
I saw a threat,

33
00:04:36,902 --> 00:04:38,820
and I took care of it

34
00:04:36,902 --> 00:04:38,820
the only way that I could.

35
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,572
A threat?

36
00:04:40,572 --> 00:04:43,075
The kid was waving at us.

37
00:04:43,075 --> 00:04:45,452
He wasn't going anywhere.

38
00:04:43,075 --> 00:04:45,452
He was saying hi.

39
00:04:45,452 --> 00:04:46,745
Yeah, but you

40
00:04:45,452 --> 00:04:46,745
don't know that.

41
00:04:46,745 --> 00:04:47,996
Yeah, I do.

42
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:49,664
He didn't know

43
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:49,664
what he'd seen.

44
00:04:49,664 --> 00:04:51,166
Well, I didn't want

45
00:04:49,664 --> 00:04:51,166
to take that chance.

46
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:53,376
I... The whole point

47
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:53,376
of this thing was

48
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:53,376
that no one

49
00:04:53,376 --> 00:04:55,503
was supposed know

50
00:04:53,376 --> 00:04:55,503
that we were even there,

51
00:04:53,376 --> 00:04:55,503
right?

52
00:04:55,503 --> 00:04:58,298
People weren't

53
00:04:55,503 --> 00:04:58,298
ever supposed to know

54
00:04:55,503 --> 00:04:58,298
that anything got robbed.

55
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:00,508
How could we have let

56
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:00,508
the kid go?

57
00:05:00,508 --> 00:05:02,094
He made us. If I hadn't

58
00:05:00,508 --> 00:05:02,094
done what I did,

59
00:05:02,094 --> 00:05:03,762
the whole mission

60
00:05:02,094 --> 00:05:03,762
would've failed.

61
00:05:03,762 --> 00:05:05,847
I'm... I'm real sorry.

62
00:05:07,099 --> 00:05:09,517
I really am, but I...

63
00:05:09,517 --> 00:05:11,019
But did I make

64
00:05:09,517 --> 00:05:11,019
a mistake?

65
00:05:11,019 --> 00:05:14,564
Mr. White? 'Cause to me,

66
00:05:11,019 --> 00:05:14,564
you know, respectfully,

67
00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:15,899
I was looking out

68
00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:15,899
for the team.

69
00:05:15,899 --> 00:05:17,192
I didn't want

70
00:05:15,899 --> 00:05:17,192
to kill him.

71
00:05:17,192 --> 00:05:18,986
You gotta believe that.

72
00:05:18,986 --> 00:05:23,531
At the end of the day,

73
00:05:18,986 --> 00:05:23,531
it was him or us,

74
00:05:18,986 --> 00:05:23,531
and I chose us.

75
00:05:23,531 --> 00:05:26,409
And I would do it again.

76
00:05:26,409 --> 00:05:29,997
Okay, look. Uh...

77
00:05:29,997 --> 00:05:34,209
Todd, why don't you step

78
00:05:29,997 --> 00:05:34,209
outside for a few minutes

79
00:05:34,209 --> 00:05:36,295
so we can

80
00:05:34,209 --> 00:05:36,295
talk this through?

81
00:05:36,295 --> 00:05:38,213
Of course.

82
00:05:36,295 --> 00:05:38,213
Yeah, you guys talk.

83
00:05:38,213 --> 00:05:39,798
But I just want

84
00:05:38,213 --> 00:05:39,798
to make sure

85
00:05:39,798 --> 00:05:41,925
that you know

86
00:05:39,798 --> 00:05:41,925
that my priority

87
00:05:39,798 --> 00:05:41,925
is this business.

88
00:05:41,925 --> 00:05:44,219
Okay. That's...

89
00:05:41,925 --> 00:05:44,219
That's fine, Todd.

90
00:05:41,925 --> 00:05:44,219
Thank you.

91
00:05:44,219 --> 00:05:46,847
I want to be

92
00:05:44,219 --> 00:05:46,847
a real part of this.

93
00:05:46,847 --> 00:05:48,890
All right? If you

94
00:05:46,847 --> 00:05:48,890
could just see that.

95
00:05:46,847 --> 00:05:48,890
I'm motivated.

96
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:50,684
And I've got connections.

97
00:05:50,684 --> 00:05:53,061
Yeah. My uncle's got

98
00:05:50,684 --> 00:05:53,061
his hookups in prison

99
00:05:53,061 --> 00:05:55,480
who I think could be

100
00:05:53,061 --> 00:05:55,480
a real help to us if...

101
00:06:04,281 --> 00:06:07,868
Okay. That dude?

102
00:06:04,281 --> 00:06:07,868
Whack-job.

103
00:06:07,868 --> 00:06:09,410
Let's just stick

104
00:06:07,868 --> 00:06:09,410
to the facts here.

105
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:11,913
Facts?

106
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:11,913
Oh, okay. uh...

107
00:06:11,913 --> 00:06:14,124
How about the fact

108
00:06:11,913 --> 00:06:14,124
that he shot a kid?

109
00:06:14,124 --> 00:06:16,459
A kid that he didn't

110
00:06:14,124 --> 00:06:16,459
need to shoot.

111
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:18,419
The boy had seen us.

112
00:06:18,419 --> 00:06:22,257
And, no, it didn't

113
00:06:18,419 --> 00:06:22,257
look like he knew

114
00:06:18,419 --> 00:06:22,257
what he was seeing.

115
00:06:23,342 --> 00:06:26,345
But what if

116
00:06:23,342 --> 00:06:26,345
he told somebody?

117
00:06:26,345 --> 00:06:29,264
What if he

118
00:06:26,345 --> 00:06:29,264
just mentioned it

119
00:06:26,345 --> 00:06:29,264
in passing?

120
00:06:29,264 --> 00:06:31,266
We can't know

121
00:06:29,264 --> 00:06:31,266
what someone...

122
00:06:31,266 --> 00:06:35,312
Exactly. We can't know,

123
00:06:31,266 --> 00:06:35,312
because Ricky Hitler there

124
00:06:31,266 --> 00:06:35,312
shot him.

125
00:06:35,312 --> 00:06:38,732
We, us three, should've had

126
00:06:35,312 --> 00:06:38,732
a discussion about it.

127
00:06:38,732 --> 00:06:40,692
We would've

128
00:06:38,732 --> 00:06:40,692
figured it out.

129
00:06:40,692 --> 00:06:44,112
But that dickhead

130
00:06:40,692 --> 00:06:44,112
just went ahead and

131
00:06:40,692 --> 00:06:44,112
made the choice for us.

132
00:06:44,112 --> 00:06:45,572
Is that how

133
00:06:44,112 --> 00:06:45,572
we do business now?

134
00:06:45,572 --> 00:06:46,990
Look, I understand

135
00:06:45,572 --> 00:06:46,990
you're upset.

136
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:48,825
And what was that crap

137
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:48,825
about his uncle

138
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:50,702
with the...with the prison

139
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:50,702
connections?

140
00:06:50,702 --> 00:06:53,663
It's just some bullshit

141
00:06:50,702 --> 00:06:53,663
intimidation move.

142
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:55,249
Come on.

143
00:06:55,249 --> 00:06:58,168
It's true, though.

144
00:06:55,249 --> 00:06:58,168
He does have

145
00:06:55,249 --> 00:06:58,168
some connections.

146
00:06:58,168 --> 00:06:59,753
Is this a problem?

147
00:06:59,753 --> 00:07:02,089
No. It's nothing

148
00:06:59,753 --> 00:07:02,089
to be concerned about.

149
00:07:02,089 --> 00:07:04,341
It came up

150
00:07:02,089 --> 00:07:04,341
in the background

151
00:07:02,089 --> 00:07:04,341
I did on him.

152
00:07:04,341 --> 00:07:07,302
Didn't worry me then.

153
00:07:04,341 --> 00:07:07,302
He's just flexing.

154
00:07:08,803 --> 00:07:10,222
(SIGHS)

155
00:07:10,222 --> 00:07:12,766
All right.

156
00:07:12,766 --> 00:07:15,185
It seems to me that we have

157
00:07:12,766 --> 00:07:15,185
three options here,

158
00:07:15,185 --> 00:07:17,187
and none of which

159
00:07:15,185 --> 00:07:17,187
are ideal.

160
00:07:17,187 --> 00:07:20,190
One, we fire Todd.

161
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:23,651
Yeah.

162
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:23,651
I'm not a fan

163
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:23,651
of this option,

164
00:07:23,651 --> 00:07:27,739
seeing that he knows

165
00:07:23,651 --> 00:07:27,739
way too much about

166
00:07:23,651 --> 00:07:27,739
this business at this point.

167
00:07:27,739 --> 00:07:31,326
And we'd most likely

168
00:07:27,739 --> 00:07:31,326
have to pay him

169
00:07:27,739 --> 00:07:31,326
to keep quiet.

170
00:07:31,326 --> 00:07:33,412
And God only knows we've got

171
00:07:31,326 --> 00:07:33,412
enough of that going on.

172
00:07:36,206 --> 00:07:37,707
Two...

173
00:07:39,167 --> 00:07:40,794
We dispose of him.

174
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:50,804
Which leaves us

175
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:50,804
option three.

176
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:52,722
We keep him on payroll.

177
00:07:52,722 --> 00:07:54,641
Put him back

178
00:07:52,722 --> 00:07:54,641
on tenting houses,

179
00:07:54,641 --> 00:07:56,476
setting up the lab

180
00:07:54,641 --> 00:07:56,476
and so forth.

181
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:59,980
We keep him close.

182
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:59,980
Under our control.

183
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:04,151
Now, option three

184
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:04,151
would be my choice.

185
00:08:05,152 --> 00:08:07,321
Shall we vote?

186
00:08:09,406 --> 00:08:11,908
MIKE:

187
00:08:09,406 --> 00:08:11,908
I vote three, kid.

188
00:08:27,548 --> 00:08:30,510
You're still in.

189
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:33,805
(SIGHS) Right on.

190
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:33,805
Thank you so much.

191
00:08:33,805 --> 00:08:36,599
You guys totally made

192
00:08:33,805 --> 00:08:36,599
the right...

193
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:39,227
The next time you bring

194
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:39,227
a gun to a job

195
00:08:39,227 --> 00:08:41,355
without telling me,

196
00:08:41,355 --> 00:08:45,066
I will stick it

197
00:08:41,355 --> 00:08:45,066
up your ass sideways.

198
00:08:46,485 --> 00:08:48,862
You understand?

199
00:08:46,485 --> 00:08:48,862
Yes, sir.

200
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:46,211
Hey, boss. What's up?

201
00:09:46,211 --> 00:09:48,629
I was just

202
00:09:46,211 --> 00:09:48,629
in the neighborhood.

203
00:09:46,211 --> 00:09:48,629
Anything going on?

204
00:09:48,629 --> 00:09:51,299
No. He's just hanging out

205
00:09:48,629 --> 00:09:51,299
with his granddaughter.

206
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:53,468
Well, isn't that sweet?

207
00:09:53,468 --> 00:09:55,262
Here, let me see.

208
00:10:35,843 --> 00:10:37,971
It's a dead drop.

209
00:10:37,971 --> 00:10:39,806
What?

210
00:10:37,971 --> 00:10:39,806
A dead drop.

211
00:10:39,806 --> 00:10:41,975
He just stashed something

212
00:10:39,806 --> 00:10:41,975
underneath that trash can.

213
00:10:41,975 --> 00:10:44,436
Write the time down.

214
00:10:41,975 --> 00:10:44,436
Roll on it.

215
00:10:48,607 --> 00:10:50,984
Looks like

216
00:10:48,607 --> 00:10:50,984
he's leaving now.

217
00:10:52,319 --> 00:10:53,987
Anybody coming for it?

218
00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:55,863
Nope,

219
00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:55,863
not that I can see.

220
00:10:55,863 --> 00:10:58,408
Nobody in sight.

221
00:10:55,863 --> 00:10:58,408
Could be hours.

222
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:00,785
Could be.

223
00:11:01,828 --> 00:11:03,413

This little munchkin,

272
00:12:46,474 --> 00:12:49,436
I could just keep

273
00:12:46,474 --> 00:12:49,436
her forever.

00:12:49,436 --> 00:12:52,689

Yes, she is.

Oh.

him pretty busy.

282
00:13:00,572 --> 00:13:02,031
Yeah.

283
00:13:03,617 --> 00:13:06,578
More importantly,

284
00:13:03,617 --> 00:13:06,578
how are you doing?

285
00:13:06,578 --> 00:13:07,828

00:13:09,788 --> 00:13:13,960
helped me so much

00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:16,588

00:13:22,009 --> 00:13:25,305

298
00:13:25,305 --> 00:13:26,765

00:13:26,765 --> 00:13:31,686

300
00:13:26,765 --> 00:13:31,686

301
00:13:35,607 --> 00:13:38,234
Whoa.

302
00:13:35,607 --> 00:13:38,234
Whoa, whoa, honey.

303
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:40,361
Babe, what is it?

304
00:13:41,613 --> 00:13:44,157
It's okay.

305
00:13:41,613 --> 00:13:44,157
It's all right.

306
00:13:44,157 --> 00:13:46,409
Just... Why don't you

307
00:13:44,157 --> 00:13:46,409
let me take Holly, and then

308
00:13:44,157 --> 00:13:46,409
we'll talk about this?

309
00:13:46,409 --> 00:13:47,661
No. No, no, no.

310
00:13:47,661 --> 00:13:48,869
Okay.

311
00:13:47,661 --> 00:13:48,869
All right, that's fine.

312
00:13:48,869 --> 00:13:51,372
Then how about you

313
00:13:48,869 --> 00:13:51,372
just talk to me?

314
00:13:51,372 --> 00:13:53,500
Just tell me

315
00:13:51,372 --> 00:13:53,500
what's going on.

316
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,876
I just...

317
00:13:55,876 --> 00:13:58,963
I need to make

318
00:13:55,876 --> 00:13:58,963
the right decision.

319
00:13:58,963 --> 00:14:01,382
I need them to be safe.

320
00:14:01,382 --> 00:14:03,426
The kids?

321
00:14:03,426 --> 00:14:07,096
They're safe.

322
00:14:03,426 --> 00:14:07,096
Of course they are.

323
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:09,474
I just miss them so much.

324
00:14:09,474 --> 00:14:11,559
I just want

325
00:14:09,474 --> 00:14:11,559
to be with them.

326
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:13,687
Hey, you know we can

327
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:13,687
bring them back home

328
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:13,687
anytime you want.

329
00:14:13,687 --> 00:14:15,605
No.

330
00:14:15,605 --> 00:14:16,939
They need to stay.

331
00:14:16,939 --> 00:14:18,316
But I just...

332
00:14:20,943 --> 00:14:22,945
I don't know what

333
00:14:20,943 --> 00:14:22,945
to do here. I...

334
00:14:24,447 --> 00:14:27,325
Like, whatever I choose

335
00:14:24,447 --> 00:14:27,325
is wrong.

336
00:14:29,577 --> 00:14:32,664
Skyler,

337
00:14:29,577 --> 00:14:32,664
you have to tell me

338
00:14:29,577 --> 00:14:32,664
what's going on.

339
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:36,584
I... I know

340
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:36,584
sometimes you...

341
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:41,589
I know you think I have

342
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:41,589
a big mouth sometimes. I...

343
00:14:43,383 --> 00:14:45,468
But if you felt like you

344
00:14:43,383 --> 00:14:45,468
couldn't talk to me,

345
00:14:45,468 --> 00:14:48,638
I don't know what I'd do.

346
00:14:48,638 --> 00:14:50,056
Okay. So...

347
00:14:50,056 --> 00:14:53,393
So what's this about

348
00:14:50,056 --> 00:14:53,393
the kids not being safe?

349
00:14:53,393 --> 00:14:56,145
Safe from what?

350
00:14:57,438 --> 00:14:59,190
From us.

351
00:15:00,191 --> 00:15:02,777
From Walt and me.

352
00:15:02,777 --> 00:15:05,613
Like what?

353
00:15:02,777 --> 00:15:05,613
Like you're bad parents?

354
00:15:06,865 --> 00:15:10,034
Because you're not.

355
00:15:06,865 --> 00:15:10,034
Not even close.

356
00:15:11,077 --> 00:15:13,079
Marie,

357
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:16,708
there are things you

358
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:16,708
just don't know.

359
00:15:16,708 --> 00:15:19,460
That if you knew,

360
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:22,380
you'd never speak

361
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:22,380
to me again.

362
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:24,924
(FUSSING)

363
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:26,384
Try me.

364
00:15:34,058 --> 00:15:37,687
Okay. If you're

365
00:15:34,058 --> 00:15:37,687
not gonna say it,

366
00:15:34,058 --> 00:15:37,687
I will.

367
00:15:37,687 --> 00:15:40,648
Skyler, you have to

368
00:15:37,687 --> 00:15:40,648
forgive yourself for Ted.

369
00:15:40,648 --> 00:15:41,900
What?

370
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:44,985
You can't keep

371
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:44,985
beating yourself up

372
00:15:44,985 --> 00:15:48,155
over some

373
00:15:44,985 --> 00:15:48,155
stupid little affair.

374
00:15:49,449 --> 00:15:51,117
Uh...

375
00:15:51,117 --> 00:15:53,327
Walt told you.

376
00:15:51,117 --> 00:15:53,327
Please don't blame him.

377
00:15:53,327 --> 00:15:56,581
I practically forced him to,

378
00:15:53,327 --> 00:15:56,581
and I wasn't gonna

379
00:15:53,327 --> 00:15:56,581
say anything.

380
00:15:56,581 --> 00:16:00,460
But I cannot stand

381
00:15:56,581 --> 00:16:00,460
to watch you torture

382
00:15:56,581 --> 00:16:00,460
yourself like this.

383
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:02,336
You have to forgive

384
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:02,336
yourself, Skyler.

385
00:16:02,336 --> 00:16:04,714
You were having

386
00:16:02,336 --> 00:16:04,714
all these problems

387
00:16:02,336 --> 00:16:04,714
with Walt.

388
00:16:04,714 --> 00:16:07,508
And Ted is

389
00:16:04,714 --> 00:16:07,508
a really good-looking man.

390
00:16:07,508 --> 00:16:12,388

go on, right?

562
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:53,020
Yeah, I know.

00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:55,064

569

any other way.

00:22:17,628 --> 00:22:19,463
Obviously, Jesse,

572
00:22:19,463 --> 00:22:22,967
you'll have to take over

do this anymore.

586
00:22:47,491 --> 00:22:49,618
So, um...

587
00:22:49,618 --> 00:22:51,996
I'm retiring, I guess.

588
00:22:51,996 --> 00:22:53,747
That methylamine

589
00:22:51,996 --> 00:22:53,747
that we stole,

590
00:22:53,747 --> 00:22:56,959
that we nearly

591
00:22:53,747 --> 00:22:56,959
killed ourselves

592
00:22:53,747 --> 00:22:56,959
trying to steal,

593
00:22:56,959 --> 00:23:01,964
that methylamine, when cooked,

594
00:22:56,959 --> 00:23:01,964
is worth nearly $300 million.

595
00:23:01,964 --> 00:23:05,383
And you're telling me

596
00:23:01,964 --> 00:23:05,383
that you're willing

597
00:23:01,964 --> 00:23:05,383
to walk away from that?

598
00:23:05,383 --> 00:23:07,511
We're walking away

599
00:23:05,383 --> 00:23:07,511
from the meth.

600
00:23:07,511 --> 00:23:09,763
Not the methylamine.

601
00:23:09,763 --> 00:23:12,892
Jesse and I will be

602
00:23:09,763 --> 00:23:12,892
taking our two-thirds

603
00:23:09,763 --> 00:23:12,892
and we're selling it.

604
00:23:12,892 --> 00:23:16,103
I've got a connection,

605
00:23:12,892 --> 00:23:16,103
a guy I knew from my time

606
00:23:12,892 --> 00:23:16,103
with Fring.

607
00:23:16,103 --> 00:23:19,773
This guy has the capital,

608
00:23:16,103 --> 00:23:19,773
and he's motivated. Highly.

609
00:23:19,773 --> 00:23:22,943
Mike's thinking we'll clear,

610
00:23:19,773 --> 00:23:22,943
like, five million. Each.

611
00:23:22,943 --> 00:23:26,404
I'll pay off

612
00:23:22,943 --> 00:23:26,404
my guys in lock-up

613
00:23:22,943 --> 00:23:26,404
out of my share.

614
00:23:26,404 --> 00:23:28,866
And those legacy costs

615
00:23:26,404 --> 00:23:28,866
that you're so fond of,

616
00:23:28,866 --> 00:23:30,868
you won't have

617
00:23:28,866 --> 00:23:30,868
to worry about anymore.

618
00:23:30,868 --> 00:23:33,746
And then I will be

619
00:23:30,868 --> 00:23:33,746
going on my way.

620
00:23:33,746 --> 00:23:35,789
Jesse too.

621
00:23:35,789 --> 00:23:38,542
It's a solid plan.

622
00:23:38,542 --> 00:23:41,295
You can come in on this

623
00:23:38,542 --> 00:23:41,295
with us.

624
00:23:42,338 --> 00:23:44,257
That'd be cool.

625
00:23:44,257 --> 00:23:49,011
'Course, you know,

626
00:23:44,257 --> 00:23:49,011
you are free to hold

627
00:23:44,257 --> 00:23:49,011
onto your third

628
00:23:49,011 --> 00:23:50,763
and keep cooking.

629
00:23:55,475 --> 00:23:58,520
You'll be selling

630
00:23:55,475 --> 00:23:58,520
to my competitors.

631
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:01,274
This guy and his crew

632
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:01,274
are way out in Phoenix.

633
00:24:01,274 --> 00:24:03,984
It's a big country,

634
00:24:01,274 --> 00:24:03,984
Walter.

635
00:24:03,984 --> 00:24:06,404
Whole lot of meth-heads.

636
00:24:06,404 --> 00:24:09,282
Pennies on the dollar,

637
00:24:06,404 --> 00:24:09,282
Jesse.

638
00:24:09,282 --> 00:24:11,700
And that's what you're

639
00:24:09,282 --> 00:24:11,700
gonna sell out for?

640
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:14,661
Pennies? Why?

641
00:24:14,661 --> 00:24:17,581
Five million

642
00:24:14,661 --> 00:24:17,581
isn't pennies.

643
00:24:17,581 --> 00:24:19,583
It's more money

644
00:24:17,581 --> 00:24:19,583
than I've ever seen.

645
00:24:19,583 --> 00:24:22,586
And when it

646
00:24:19,583 --> 00:24:22,586
comes down to it,

647
00:24:22,586 --> 00:24:25,298
are we in

648
00:24:22,586 --> 00:24:25,298
the meth business?

649
00:24:25,298 --> 00:24:27,549
Or the money business?

650
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:35,182
(SIGHS)

651
00:24:39,145 --> 00:24:41,730
Relax, kid.

652
00:24:39,145 --> 00:24:41,730
There's no one there.

653
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:43,816
You sure?

654
00:24:43,816 --> 00:24:46,026
I wouldn't be here

655
00:24:43,816 --> 00:24:46,026
if I wasn't.

656
00:25:16,182 --> 00:25:17,808
Glad to see

657
00:25:16,182 --> 00:25:17,808
you could make it out.

658
00:25:17,808 --> 00:25:20,394
I was surprised

659
00:25:17,808 --> 00:25:20,394
to get your call.

660
00:25:20,394 --> 00:25:22,021
Good surprise, I hope.

661
00:25:23,314 --> 00:25:25,858
There's one gallon,

662
00:25:23,314 --> 00:25:25,858
as discussed.

663
00:25:25,858 --> 00:25:28,486
You take that back home

664
00:25:25,858 --> 00:25:28,486
to your people, test it.

665
00:25:28,486 --> 00:25:32,156
If you're satisfied,

666
00:25:28,486 --> 00:25:32,156
I can get the other 665.

667
00:25:32,156 --> 00:25:33,782
All right.

668
00:25:32,156 --> 00:25:33,782
That's fair enough.

669
00:25:33,782 --> 00:25:35,493
Shall we talk money?

670
00:25:36,576 --> 00:25:38,287
That one's free.

671
00:25:38,287 --> 00:25:41,165
The price for the rest

672
00:25:38,287 --> 00:25:41,165
is 15,000 per...

673
00:25:41,165 --> 00:25:46,837
665 gallons,

674
00:25:41,165 --> 00:25:46,837
that's 9,975,000.

675
00:25:46,837 --> 00:25:49,465
Although I would prefer

676
00:25:46,837 --> 00:25:49,465
you round it up to ten.

677
00:25:49,465 --> 00:25:52,759
Makes it easier

678
00:25:49,465 --> 00:25:52,759
for my partner

679
00:25:49,465 --> 00:25:52,759
and I to split.

680
00:25:52,759 --> 00:25:54,094
Steep.

681
00:25:54,094 --> 00:25:57,264
Mmm. We good?

682
00:25:58,932 --> 00:26:00,434
Yeah. I'll talk to my guys,

683
00:25:58,932 --> 00:26:00,434
but I should be able

684
00:26:00,434 --> 00:26:02,311
to put together

685
00:26:00,434 --> 00:26:02,311
that cash, yeah.

686
00:26:02,311 --> 00:26:04,230
Good.

687
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:06,106
I gotta tell you,

688
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:06,106
this is worth it

689
00:26:06,106 --> 00:26:08,442
just to get that blue stuff

690
00:26:06,106 --> 00:26:08,442
of yours off the market.

691
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:15,991
The blue stuff will be

692
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:15,991
off the market, right?

693
00:26:19,661 --> 00:26:24,208
Now, this whole time,

694
00:26:19,661 --> 00:26:24,208
I was thinking 666,

695
00:26:24,208 --> 00:26:27,336
that seems

696
00:26:24,208 --> 00:26:27,336
like an odd number.

697
00:26:27,336 --> 00:26:29,088
Two-thirds of an even

698
00:26:27,336 --> 00:26:29,088
thousand, though.

699
00:26:29,088 --> 00:26:33,675
When I look at it that way,

700
00:26:29,088 --> 00:26:33,675
it starts to make sense to me.

701
00:26:33,675 --> 00:26:36,429
That's not all

702
00:26:33,675 --> 00:26:36,429
the methylamine, is it?

703
00:26:38,305 --> 00:26:42,059
You two have a partner

704
00:26:38,305 --> 00:26:42,059
you haven't mentioned?

705
00:26:42,059 --> 00:26:45,979
This other party wouldn't be

706
00:26:42,059 --> 00:26:45,979
a problem for you.

707
00:26:45,979 --> 00:26:47,898
His territory

708
00:26:45,979 --> 00:26:47,898
won't impact yours.

709
00:26:47,898 --> 00:26:49,607
You see, that doesn't

710
00:26:47,898 --> 00:26:49,607
work for me.

711
00:26:49,607 --> 00:26:50,943
I'm not just buying this

712
00:26:49,607 --> 00:26:50,943
for the supply.

713
00:26:50,943 --> 00:26:52,528
I'm buying this

714
00:26:50,943 --> 00:26:52,528
for the demand.

715
00:26:52,528 --> 00:26:55,155
I'm looking to increase

716
00:26:52,528 --> 00:26:55,155
my market share here, Mike.

717
00:26:55,155 --> 00:26:57,116
Well, I don't know

718
00:26:55,155 --> 00:26:57,116
what to tell you.

719
00:26:57,116 --> 00:26:59,910
I want you to tell me

720
00:26:57,116 --> 00:26:59,910
that Fring's blue

721
00:26:59,910 --> 00:27:01,412
will be off the streets.

722
00:27:05,958 --> 00:27:10,421
All right. Here's

723
00:27:05,958 --> 00:27:10,421
a new deal for you then.

724
00:27:10,421 --> 00:27:15,342
I'll pay you 15K a gallon

725
00:27:10,421 --> 00:27:15,342
for the full thousand gallons.

726
00:27:15,342 --> 00:27:17,177
Not a drop less.

727
00:27:19,388 --> 00:27:22,182
It's not mine to sell,

728
00:27:19,388 --> 00:27:22,182
Declan.

729
00:27:22,182 --> 00:27:24,310
Well then, no deal, Mike.

730
00:27:29,106 --> 00:27:30,732
(PHONE BUZZES)

731
00:27:43,745 --> 00:27:45,331
(PHONE BUZZES)

732
00:27:48,125 --> 00:27:49,918
Yes?

733
00:27:51,295 --> 00:27:54,548
Yes. I guess.

734
00:27:56,758 --> 00:27:58,718
I don't know.

735
00:27:58,718 --> 00:28:00,887
Why don't you

736
00:27:58,718 --> 00:28:00,887
come over here?

737
00:28:01,888 --> 00:28:03,516
To my house.

738
00:28:05,309 --> 00:28:07,811
Yes, seriously.

739
00:28:14,568 --> 00:28:16,278
Hey.

740
00:28:21,992 --> 00:28:24,744
Yo, you sure

741
00:28:21,992 --> 00:28:24,744
this is okay?

742
00:28:24,744 --> 00:28:27,373
She's not here.

743
00:28:24,744 --> 00:28:27,373
Nobody's here.

744
00:28:28,874 --> 00:28:31,001
All right.

745
00:28:28,874 --> 00:28:31,001
So, uh...

746
00:28:32,503 --> 00:28:34,046
Something's come up.

747
00:28:34,046 --> 00:28:36,423
Mike wanted to come here

748
00:28:34,046 --> 00:28:36,423
to give you the hard sell,

749
00:28:36,423 --> 00:28:41,136
but I figured

750
00:28:36,423 --> 00:28:41,136
it'd be better

751
00:28:36,423 --> 00:28:41,136
coming from me.

752
00:28:41,136 --> 00:28:43,972
Mike's connection

753
00:28:41,136 --> 00:28:43,972
won't buy mine

754
00:28:41,136 --> 00:28:43,972
and Mike's shares

755
00:28:43,972 --> 00:28:46,975
of the methylamine

756
00:28:43,972 --> 00:28:46,975
unless he gets

757
00:28:43,972 --> 00:28:46,975
your share, too.

758
00:28:46,975 --> 00:28:50,229
He wants the entire

759
00:28:46,975 --> 00:28:50,229
thousand gallons.

760
00:28:50,229 --> 00:28:52,898
Absolutely not.

761
00:28:52,898 --> 00:28:55,568
Yeah, I figured

762
00:28:52,898 --> 00:28:55,568
you'd say that.

763
00:28:55,568 --> 00:28:57,944
But I've been thinking

764
00:28:55,568 --> 00:28:57,944
about it,

765
00:28:57,944 --> 00:29:01,240
and it really

766
00:28:57,944 --> 00:29:01,240
makes sense.

767
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:03,909
Kinda.

768
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:03,909
It does, does it?

769
00:29:03,909 --> 00:29:07,663
Look, when you, uh,

770
00:29:03,909 --> 00:29:07,663
when you started this thing,

771
00:29:07,663 --> 00:29:10,249
did you ever dream

772
00:29:07,663 --> 00:29:10,249
of having $5 million?

773
00:29:10,249 --> 00:29:12,459
I know for a fact

774
00:29:10,249 --> 00:29:12,459
that you didn't.

775
00:29:12,459 --> 00:29:16,880
I know for a fact all you

776
00:29:12,459 --> 00:29:16,880
needed was was 737,000,

777
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:20,008

like, mathematically.

779
00:29:20,008 --> 00:29:24,513
Look, if selling

780
00:29:20,008 --> 00:29:24,513
the methylamine now means that

781
00:29:20,008 --> 00:29:24,513
no one else ever gets killed,

782
00:29:24,513 --> 00:29:27,433
then I vote for that, man.

783
00:29:24,513 --> 00:29:27,433
Hands down.

784
00:29:27,433 --> 00:29:29,184
And we could

785
00:29:27,433 --> 00:29:29,184
have it tomorrow.

786
00:29:29,184 --> 00:29:30,728
We would be out.

787
00:29:30,728 --> 00:29:32,438
You could spend time

788
00:29:30,728 --> 00:29:32,438
with your family.

789
00:29:32,438 --> 00:29:34,064
No more worrying

790
00:29:32,438 --> 00:29:34,064

791
00:29:34,064 --> 00:29:35,733
or finding out

792
00:29:34,064 --> 00:29:35,733
about everything.

793
00:29:35,733 --> 00:29:37,693
Isn't this what you've

794
00:29:35,733 --> 00:29:37,693
been working for?

795
00:29:37,693 --> 00:29:40,237
I have not been working

796
00:29:37,693 --> 00:29:40,237
this hard just to sell out.

797
00:29:40,237 --> 00:29:44,783
It's not selling out.

798
00:29:40,237 --> 00:29:44,783
Yes, it is, Jesse.

799
00:29:44,783 --> 00:29:49,538
I ha...we have suffered

800
00:29:44,783 --> 00:29:49,538
and bled, literally,

801
00:29:44,783 --> 00:29:49,538
for this business.

802
00:29:49,538 --> 00:29:52,958
And I will not

803
00:29:49,538 --> 00:29:52,958
throw it away for nothing.

804
00:29:52,958 --> 00:29:56,420

805
00:29:52,958 --> 00:29:56,420

806

807
00:29:56,420 --> 00:29:59,757
$5 million

808
00:29:56,420 --> 00:29:59,757
isn't nothing.

809
00:30:02,092 --> 00:30:06,346
Jesse, have you heard

810
00:30:02,092 --> 00:30:06,346
of a company called

811
00:30:02,092 --> 00:30:06,346
"Gray Matter"?

812
00:30:06,346 --> 00:30:07,640
No.

813
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:09,683
Well, I co-founded it

814
00:30:09,683 --> 00:30:12,519
in grad school

815
00:30:09,683 --> 00:30:12,519
with a couple

816
00:30:09,683 --> 00:30:12,519
of friends of mine.

817
00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:14,980
Actually, I was

818
00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:14,980
the one who named it.

819
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:17,608
And back then, it was just...

820
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:17,608
Oh, it was just small-time.

821
00:30:17,608 --> 00:30:20,026
We had a couple

822
00:30:17,608 --> 00:30:20,026
patents pending.

823
00:30:20,026 --> 00:30:22,321
But nothing

824
00:30:20,026 --> 00:30:22,321
earth-shattering.

825
00:30:22,321 --> 00:30:26,158
'Course, we all knew

826
00:30:22,321 --> 00:30:26,158
the potential.

827
00:30:26,158 --> 00:30:29,369
Yeah. We were gonna take

828
00:30:26,158 --> 00:30:29,369
the world by storm.

829
00:30:31,622 --> 00:30:34,166
And then...

830
00:30:34,166 --> 00:30:38,086
This, uh... Well,

831
00:30:34,166 --> 00:30:38,086
something happened

832
00:30:34,166 --> 00:30:38,086
between the three of us.

833
00:30:38,086 --> 00:30:41,381
And I'm not gonna go

834
00:30:38,086 --> 00:30:41,381

835
00:30:41,381 --> 00:30:43,717
But for personal reasons,

836
00:30:43,717 --> 00:30:45,511
I decided to leave

837
00:30:43,717 --> 00:30:45,511
the company.

838
00:30:45,511 --> 00:30:48,722
And I sold my share

839
00:30:45,511 --> 00:30:48,722
to my two partners.

840
00:30:48,722 --> 00:30:52,601
I took a buyout

841
00:30:48,722 --> 00:30:52,601
for $5,000.

842
00:30:52,601 --> 00:30:56,188
Now, at the time, that was

843
00:30:52,601 --> 00:30:56,188
a lot of money for me.

844
00:30:57,690 --> 00:31:00,567

845
00:30:57,690 --> 00:31:00,567
what that company

846
00:30:57,690 --> 00:31:00,567
is worth now?

847
00:31:00,567 --> 00:31:03,862
Millions?

848
00:31:03,862 --> 00:31:06,865

849
00:31:06,865 --> 00:31:11,161
2.16 billion

850
00:31:06,865 --> 00:31:11,161
as of last Friday.

851
00:31:11,161 --> 00:31:13,706
I look it up every week.

852
00:31:13,706 --> 00:31:16,792

854
00:31:18,877 --> 00:31:21,087
for $5,000.

855
00:31:22,798 --> 00:31:26,926
I sold my kids' birthright

856
00:31:22,798 --> 00:31:26,926
for a few months' rent.

859
00:31:35,101 --> 00:31:39,189
if I was in the meth business

860
00:31:35,101 --> 00:31:39,189

00:31:39,189 --> 00:31:40,899
Neither.

00:36:21,596 --> 00:36:24,641
of the house.

973
00:36:30,313 --> 00:36:33,108
She told me

974
00:36:33,108 --> 00:36:35,652
that she was

975
00:36:33,108 --> 00:36:35,652
counting the days

976
00:36:35,652 --> 00:36:38,196
until my cancer

977
00:36:35,652 --> 00:36:38,196
came back.

978
00:36:41,867 --> 00:36:45,037
My wife is waiting

979
00:36:41,867 --> 00:36:45,037
for me to die.

980
00:36:47,664 --> 00:36:50,959
This business is all

981
00:36:47,664 --> 00:36:50,959
I have left now.

982
00:36:55,714 --> 00:36:57,716
It's all I have.

983
00:37:02,012 --> 00:37:04,556
And you want to

984
00:37:02,012 --> 00:37:04,556
take it away from me.

985
00:37:26,912 --> 00:37:29,831
I thought you might

986
00:37:26,912 --> 00:37:29,831
try something stupid.

987
00:37:29,831 --> 00:37:32,709
Look, Mike...

988
00:37:29,831 --> 00:37:32,709
Don't bother, Walter.

989
00:37:32,709 --> 00:37:35,170
Come join me

990
00:37:32,709 --> 00:37:35,170
in the office.

991
00:37:37,338 --> 00:37:39,925
I don't think so.

992
00:37:39,925 --> 00:37:41,968
That's not a request.

993
00:37:46,389 --> 00:37:49,434
Might as well

994
00:37:46,389 --> 00:37:49,434
get comfortable.

995
00:37:49,434 --> 00:37:51,477
This deal's going down

996
00:37:49,434 --> 00:37:51,477
tomorrow. It's happening,

997
00:37:51,477 --> 00:37:53,105
and there's nothing

998
00:37:51,477 --> 00:37:53,105
you can do to stop it.

999
00:37:53,105 --> 00:37:55,857
Got it?

1000
00:37:53,105 --> 00:37:55,857
Oh, so it's okay for you

1001
00:37:53,105 --> 00:37:55,857
to steal my...

1002
00:37:55,857 --> 00:37:58,902
And to ensure that,

1003
00:37:55,857 --> 00:37:58,902
you and I are gonna spend

1004
00:37:58,902 --> 00:38:01,696
the rest of the night

1005
00:37:58,902 --> 00:38:01,696
together in this office.

1006
00:38:01,696 --> 00:38:04,116
Like it's my birthday.

1007
00:38:01,696 --> 00:38:04,116
Mike...

1008
00:38:04,116 --> 00:38:07,326
When the deal is done,

1009
00:38:04,116 --> 00:38:07,326
you'll get your money.

1010
00:38:04,116 --> 00:38:07,326
I guarantee that.

1011
00:38:07,326 --> 00:38:11,206
Let me cook it.

1012
00:38:07,326 --> 00:38:11,206
I'll double your five

1013
00:38:07,326 --> 00:38:11,206
and you still walk.

1014
00:38:11,206 --> 00:38:15,210
You know, I have never seen

1015
00:38:11,206 --> 00:38:15,210
anybody work so hard

1016
00:38:11,206 --> 00:38:15,210
not to get $5 million.

1017
00:38:15,210 --> 00:38:17,670
Mike, you need

1018
00:38:15,210 --> 00:38:17,670
to listen to me.

1019
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:20,257
No, Walter.

1020
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:20,257
The last thing

1021
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:20,257
I need to do

1022
00:38:20,257 --> 00:38:22,467
is listen to you.

1023
00:38:20,257 --> 00:38:22,467
Now, sit down.

1024
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:56,584
All right.

1025
00:38:56,584 --> 00:38:59,045
Walter, I've got

1026
00:38:56,584 --> 00:38:59,045
a bit of a quandary here.

1027
00:38:59,045 --> 00:39:02,966
I've got something

1028
00:38:59,045 --> 00:39:02,966
I need to attend to

1029
00:38:59,045 --> 00:39:02,966
before this deal happens.

1030
00:39:02,966 --> 00:39:07,345
But for some reason,

1031
00:39:02,966 --> 00:39:07,345
I don't trust you alone

1032
00:39:02,966 --> 00:39:07,345
with the methylamine.

1033
00:39:07,345 --> 00:39:11,141
I'm gonna have to

1034
00:39:07,345 --> 00:39:11,141
restrain you.

1035
00:39:11,141 --> 00:39:13,101
You gotta be kidding.

1036
00:39:13,101 --> 00:39:16,062
Stand up for me,

1037
00:39:13,101 --> 00:39:16,062

1038
00:39:16,062 --> 00:39:17,897
Stand up.

1039
00:39:19,316 --> 00:39:21,901
Turn around for me.

Arms out to the side.

1041
00:39:23,195 --> 00:39:25,363
Up.

1042
00:39:39,294 --> 00:39:42,130
Oh, man.

1043
00:39:39,294 --> 00:39:42,130
Sit down.

1044
00:39:43,298 --> 00:39:45,133
Sit down.

1045
00:39:48,594 --> 00:39:50,055
Give me your wrist.

1046
00:39:58,104 --> 00:39:59,522
Sorry.

Mr. Ehrmantraut

1062
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:00,870
has become the subject

1063
00:43:00,870 --> 00:43:02,747

00:43:07,502 --> 00:43:09,921
that sound right to you?

1068
00:43:09,921 --> 00:43:12,173
I have no idea what

1069
00:43:09,921 --> 00:43:12,173
he's talking about.

as you like, Fonzie.

1072
00:43:14,133 --> 00:43:17,387
But we all know you've

1073
00:43:14,133 --> 00:43:17,387
been following my client

1074
00:43:14,133 --> 00:43:17,387
day and night.

1075
00:43:17,387 --> 00:43:20,473
The poor man can't even

1076
00:43:17,387 --> 00:43:20,473
spend a few minutes

1077

1083
00:43:25,103 --> 00:43:28,356
Well, it's disturbing.

1084
00:43:28,356 --> 00:43:33,528
And it's taken a toll

1085
00:43:28,356 --> 00:43:33,528
on his mental and

1086
00:43:28,356 --> 00:43:33,528
physical well-being.

1087
00:43:33,528 --> 00:43:36,322
Your client

1088
00:43:33,528 --> 00:43:36,322
looks fine to me.

1089
00:43:36,322 --> 00:43:40,452
Well, some hurts only show

1090
00:43:36,322 --> 00:43:40,452
on the inside.

1091
00:43:40,452 --> 00:43:43,913
Now, you guys don't even

1092
00:43:40,452 --> 00:43:43,913
have warrants for

1093
00:43:40,452 --> 00:43:43,913
these tails, do you?

1094
00:43:43,913 --> 00:43:47,584
Theoretically, these tails

1095
00:43:43,913 --> 00:43:47,584
you refer to would be

1096
00:43:47,584 --> 00:43:49,168
completely within

1097
00:43:47,584 --> 00:43:49,168
the bounds of the law.

1098
00:43:49,168 --> 00:43:51,129
We don't need a warrant

1099
00:43:49,168 --> 00:43:51,129

1100
00:43:51,129 --> 00:43:52,547
through a public place.

1101
00:43:51,129 --> 00:43:52,547
Theoretically.

1102
00:43:52,547 --> 00:43:55,633
Yeah, that is, uh,

1103
00:43:52,547 --> 00:43:55,633
theoretically correct.

1104
00:43:55,633 --> 00:44:00,096
However, I would counter

1105
00:43:55,633 --> 00:44:00,096
that an open-ended,

1106
00:43:55,633 --> 00:44:00,096
unrestricted surveillance

1107
00:44:00,096 --> 00:44:03,516
like this amounts

1108
00:44:00,096 --> 00:44:03,516
to stalking.

1109
00:44:03,516 --> 00:44:05,851
(LAUGHS)

1110
00:44:03,516 --> 00:44:05,851
Which is illegal.

1111
00:44:05,851 --> 00:44:08,354
Now, I don't know what it is

1112
00:44:05,851 --> 00:44:08,354
you find so interesting

1113
00:44:08,354 --> 00:44:11,316
about my client,

1114
00:44:08,354 --> 00:44:11,316
and I'm not here to judge.

1115
00:44:11,316 --> 00:44:15,778

00:44:11,316 --> 00:44:15,778

00:44:11,316 --> 00:44:15,778
not that into you.

<i>he's gonna get one.</i>

1163
00:45:22,094 --> 00:45:23,513
That was a hell

1164
00:45:22,094 --> 00:45:23,513
of a gamble.

1165
00:45:23,513 --> 00:45:24,763
Worked.

1166
00:45:24,763 --> 00:45:27,892
Yeah, well, not for long.

1167
00:45:27,892 --> 00:45:31,437
He's right about that T.R.O.

1168
00:45:27,892 --> 00:45:31,437
It's gonna get tossed

1169
00:45:27,892 --> 00:45:31,437
toute suite.

1170
00:45:31,437 --> 00:45:34,940

So have fun with that.

1174
00:45:36,775 --> 00:45:39,487
How much time I got?

1175
00:45:39,487 --> 00:45:41,989
Maybe 24 hours.

1176
00:45:41,989 --> 00:45:43,575
It's enough.

1177
00:45:43,575 --> 00:45:45,535
It better be.

1178
00:45:43,575 --> 00:45:45,535
Whatever you got planned,

1179
00:45:45,535 --> 00:45:48,496
you best pull the ripcord

1180
00:45:45,535 --> 00:45:48,496
while you still

1181
00:45:45,535 --> 00:45:48,496

(GARAGE DOOR OPENS)

1183
00:46:02,343 --> 00:46:03,928
Where is it?

1184
00:46:02,343 --> 00:46:03,928
Mike...

1185
00:46:03,928 --> 00:46:05,555
Mike!

1186
00:46:03,928 --> 00:46:05,555
Get out of my way.

1187
00:46:05,555 --> 00:46:06,972
You, sit down.

1188
00:46:06,972 --> 00:46:08,765
Mike! Mike!

1189
00:46:06,972 --> 00:46:08,765
Hold on, okay?

1190
00:46:08,765 --> 00:46:11,143
I am gonna

1191
00:46:08,765 --> 00:46:11,143
count to three.

1192
00:46:08,765 --> 00:46:11,143
Mr. White's got an idea.

1193
00:46:11,143 --> 00:46:12,437
Mike, I'm serious.

1194
00:46:11,143 --> 00:46:12,437
One.

1195
00:46:12,437 --> 00:46:14,105
Two.

1196
00:46:12,437 --> 00:46:14,105
It's a great idea.

1197
00:46:14,105 --> 00:46:16,274
Look, you get

1198
00:46:14,105 --> 00:46:16,274
your five million,

1199
00:46:14,105 --> 00:46:16,274
we both do,

1200
00:46:16,274 --> 00:46:17,567
and he gets

1201
00:46:16,274 --> 00:46:17,567
his methylamine,

1202
00:46:16,274 --> 00:46:17,567
all right?

1203
00:46:17,567 --> 00:46:19,485
Just hear him out.

1204
00:46:24,657 --> 00:46:26,409
Is that true, Walter?

1205
00:46:30,329 --> 00:46:32,540
Everybody wins.
