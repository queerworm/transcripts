It was an M name though.

579
00:26:31,048 --> 00:26:33,551
Yeah.

580
00:26:33,551 --> 00:26:36,512
I remember the "muh" sound.

581
00:26:36,512 --> 00:26:42,351
All right, well, we'll go

582
00:26:36,512 --> 00:26:42,351
with the "muh" sound.

583
00:26:42,351 --> 00:26:44,437
Thanks a lot. Appreciate it.

584
00:26:42,351 --> 00:26:44,437
Yeah.

585
00:26:44,437 --> 00:26:46,604
He definitely had tan pants.

586
00:26:49,816 --> 00:26:51,735
Remind me to get a vasectomy.

587
00:26:51,735 --> 00:26:54,696
Okay, it's after 9, so this bar

588
00:26:51,735 --> 00:26:54,696
that Girl George is at,

589
00:26:54,696 --> 00:26:57,032
probably wall-to-wall dirtbags

590
00:26:54,696 --> 00:26:57,032
by now.

591
00:26:57,032 --> 00:26:59,243
Let's go have a little

592
00:26:57,032 --> 00:26:59,243
looky-loo,

593
00:26:59,243 --> 00:27:02,371
see if we can't find

594
00:26:59,243 --> 00:27:02,371
this M-named clown.

595
00:27:05,832 --> 00:27:08,419
What? It's a lead.

596
00:27:08,419 --> 00:27:11,338
Lead to what?

597
00:27:08,419 --> 00:27:11,338
To Heisenberg.

598
00:27:11,338 --> 00:27:13,424
I told you it was

599
00:27:11,338 --> 00:27:13,424
only a matter of time

600
00:27:13,424 --> 00:27:15,301
before this guy booted

601
00:27:13,424 --> 00:27:15,301
up again.

602
00:27:15,301 --> 00:27:16,927
Here we go, my friend.

603
00:27:16,927 --> 00:27:19,346
Don't hate me because

604
00:27:16,927 --> 00:27:19,346
I'm beautiful, Gomey.

605
00:27:19,346 --> 00:27:22,224
Just apologize and

606
00:27:19,346 --> 00:27:22,224
buy me a beer.

607
00:27:23,225 --> 00:27:25,603
Man, you're

608
00:27:23,225 --> 00:27:25,603
reaching.

609
00:27:25,603 --> 00:27:29,898
This stuff could be a knockoff

610
00:27:25,603 --> 00:27:29,898
or left over from an older cook.

611
00:27:29,898 --> 00:27:33,360
How do you know Heisenberg's

612
00:27:29,898 --> 00:27:33,360
gearing up again?

613
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,821
How do I know?

614
00:27:35,821 --> 00:27:38,240
Because I know.

615
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,075
I don't get it.

616
00:27:40,075 --> 00:27:43,370
This is the reason why you're

617
00:27:40,075 --> 00:27:43,370
blowing off the task force?

618
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:46,039
Chase down teeners?

619
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:49,460
I'm getting tired

620
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:49,460
of all the second-guessing.

621
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:51,669

622
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:51,669
stimulated

623
00:27:51,669 --> 00:27:53,088
by this investigation,

624
00:27:53,088 --> 00:27:55,633
do us both a favor

625
00:27:53,088 --> 00:27:55,633
and ask for a transfer.

626
00:27:55,633 --> 00:27:58,093
What is up with you lately?

627
00:27:58,093 --> 00:28:02,097
Starting bar fights,

628
00:27:58,093 --> 00:28:02,097
turning down El Paso,

629
00:28:02,097 --> 00:28:03,557
and now this bullshit?

630
00:28:03,557 --> 00:28:07,227
Do you need to talk

631
00:28:03,557 --> 00:28:07,227
to someone or what?

632
00:28:07,227 --> 00:28:09,687
Talk to someone?

633
00:28:09,687 --> 00:28:11,565
Talk to who?

634
00:28:15,027 --> 00:28:19,281
I'm not trying to step

635
00:28:15,027 --> 00:28:19,281
on your toes, bro. Okay?

636
00:28:19,281 --> 00:28:21,908
I'm just worried about you.

637
00:28:19,281 --> 00:28:21,908
That's all.

638
00:28:21,908 --> 00:28:25,037
Appreciate that, bro.

639
00:28:26,163 --> 00:28:28,706
Now take your hand off

640
00:28:26,163 --> 00:28:28,706
my shoulder.

641
00:28:43,305 --> 00:28:45,182
Yeah, yeah,

642
00:28:43,305 --> 00:28:45,182
the one that was on TV.

643
00:28:45,182 --> 00:28:48,352
Did any little piece

644
00:28:45,182 --> 00:28:48,352
fall on your property?

645
00:28:48,352 --> 00:28:51,480
I'm not looking for

646
00:28:48,352 --> 00:28:51,480
an entire wing here, Mr. Linkas.

647
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:54,692
It could be a nut or a bolt.

648
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:54,692
It could be a bag of peanuts,

649
00:28:54,692 --> 00:28:58,111
just so long as it caused you

650
00:28:54,692 --> 00:28:58,111
pain and suffering.

651
00:28:58,111 --> 00:29:01,073
Oh, no, no, no. Closed.

652
00:28:58,111 --> 00:29:01,073
Calling you back.

653
00:29:01,073 --> 00:29:04,159
You had your chance. I told you

654
00:29:01,073 --> 00:29:04,159
to get him cooking again.

655
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:06,286
You blew it off

656
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:06,286
and now it's too late.

657
00:29:06,286 --> 00:29:08,205

658
00:29:06,286 --> 00:29:08,205

you two your potential.

661
00:29:10,832 --> 00:29:13,335
And what do I get in return?

662
00:29:10,832 --> 00:29:13,335
A bone contusion.

663
00:29:13,335 --> 00:29:16,880
You wanna see the scar?

664
00:29:13,335 --> 00:29:16,880
I wish you two had--

665
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,798
Hi, there.

666
00:29:20,133 --> 00:29:22,261
How in the hell did you

667
00:29:20,133 --> 00:29:22,261
get Walt to--?

668
00:29:22,261 --> 00:29:23,596
I made it.

669
00:29:23,596 --> 00:29:26,848
You know the guy

670
00:29:23,596 --> 00:29:26,848
who knows the guy, right?

671
00:29:59,965 --> 00:30:01,800
Well, good news is

672
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:06,305
for a stage-three cancer,

673
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:06,305
the guy's doing well physically.

674
00:30:06,305 --> 00:30:08,557
Mentally, the guy's a disaster.

675
00:30:08,557 --> 00:30:12,269
He's gone off the rails

676
00:30:08,557 --> 00:30:12,269
over this thing with his wife.

677
00:30:12,269 --> 00:30:17,357
My opinion, he's not coming

678
00:30:12,269 --> 00:30:17,357
back. Not on his own.

679
00:30:20,736 --> 00:30:24,156
Your friends were at his place

680
00:30:20,736 --> 00:30:24,156
again, by the way.

681
00:30:24,156 --> 00:30:27,534
They drew something on the

682
00:30:24,156 --> 00:30:27,534
street outside his house.

683
00:30:27,534 --> 00:30:29,536
The scythe.

685
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:33,582
Does the lawyer know?

686
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:33,582
Should he?

687
00:30:33,582 --> 00:30:35,250
No.

688
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:41,423
If you want this guy to produce

689
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:41,423
again, why not just tell him?

690
00:30:41,423 --> 00:30:43,883
You stand between him

691
00:30:41,423 --> 00:30:43,883
and an ax in the head.

692
00:30:43,883 --> 00:30:46,804
I don't believe fear to be

693
00:30:43,883 --> 00:30:46,804
an effective motivator.

694
00:30:46,804 --> 00:30:49,097
I want investment.

695
00:30:49,097 --> 00:30:52,643
For now, I'm simply interested

barring acts of God

702
00:30:58,064 --> 00:31:01,360

703
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:02,820
Oh.

00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:05,322
From the lawyer,

705
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:05,322

the Pinkman kid

707
00:31:05,322 --> 00:31:08,241

Probably for the best.

Mm.
