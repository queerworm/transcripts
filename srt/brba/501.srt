00:19:40,387 --> 00:19:43,223
because guess what.

395
00:19:43,223 --> 00:19:46,477
Lunatics like you

396
00:19:43,223 --> 00:19:46,477
want to break into them.

397
00:19:46,477 --> 00:19:48,729
But unlike a bank vault,

398
00:19:48,729 --> 00:19:52,191
this is a place that is guarded

399
00:19:48,729 --> 00:19:52,191
24 hours a day

400
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:54,110
by the police.

401
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:56,529
There's no way

402
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:56,529
you're getting it out of there.

403
00:19:56,529 --> 00:20:00,074
Who said that we have to

404
00:19:56,529 --> 00:20:00,074
get it out of there?

405
00:20:03,369 --> 00:20:06,455
We just need to destroy

406
00:20:03,369 --> 00:20:06,455
what's on it.

407
00:20:06,455 --> 00:20:08,958
Oh, so now you want

408
00:20:06,455 --> 00:20:08,958
to blow up a police station.

409
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:10,877
I don't believe

410
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:10,877
I said that, no.

411
00:20:10,877 --> 00:20:13,796
Nursing home full of old folks

412
00:20:10,877 --> 00:20:13,796
just whet your appetite.

413
00:20:13,796 --> 00:20:15,506
Now you want to kill

414
00:20:13,796 --> 00:20:15,506
a bunch of cops.

415
00:20:15,506 --> 00:20:17,800
I never said anything

416
00:20:15,506 --> 00:20:17,800
about killing anybody.

417
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:20,761
I am, however, considering

418
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:20,761
the possibility of a device.

419
00:20:20,761 --> 00:20:23,305
A device.

420
00:20:20,761 --> 00:20:23,305
Yes, a small device.

421
00:20:23,305 --> 00:20:26,266
Say this device

422
00:20:23,305 --> 00:20:26,266
gets filed into evidence.

423
00:20:26,266 --> 00:20:28,061
Now, it is inside

424
00:20:26,266 --> 00:20:28,061
that room.

425
00:20:28,061 --> 00:20:29,395
What about a magnet?

426
00:20:29,395 --> 00:20:30,938
You want to commit

427
00:20:29,395 --> 00:20:30,938
a whole other crime

428
00:20:30,938 --> 00:20:33,024
just to get this bomb of yours

429
00:20:30,938 --> 00:20:33,024
into evidence.

430
00:20:33,024 --> 00:20:34,984
Who said bomb?

431
00:20:33,024 --> 00:20:34,984
I said a device.

432
00:20:34,984 --> 00:20:37,070
Yo, what about, like, a magnet?

433
00:20:34,984 --> 00:20:37,070
An incendiary device.

434
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:38,696
One quick fire

435
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:38,696
is all it would take.

436
00:20:38,696 --> 00:20:40,322
You don't think they have

437
00:20:38,696 --> 00:20:40,322
fire suppression?

438
00:20:40,322 --> 00:20:41,866
I'm not talking

439
00:20:40,322 --> 00:20:41,866
about sprinklers.

440
00:20:41,866 --> 00:20:43,242
I'm talking about Halon,

441
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:45,036
because Halon doesn't

442
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:45,036
destroy evidence.

443
00:20:45,036 --> 00:20:47,080
A magnet, though, maybe like...

444
00:20:45,036 --> 00:20:47,080
All right, so a bomb, then.

445
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:49,331
Maybe we plant

446
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:49,331
a bomb outside.

447
00:20:49,331 --> 00:20:51,375
Oh, actually I knew

448
00:20:49,331 --> 00:20:51,375
a crew out of Fort Worth

449
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:53,961
that tried to blow up

450
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:53,961
an evidence room from outside.

451
00:20:53,961 --> 00:20:56,380
About all they did

452
00:20:53,961 --> 00:20:56,380
was take out a couple of hedges.

453
00:20:56,380 --> 00:21:00,300
You are probably talking about 2

454
00:20:56,380 --> 00:21:00,300
feet of reinforced concrete.

455
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:01,886
Or what about

456
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:01,886
a magnet?

457
00:21:01,886 --> 00:21:04,304
What magnet?

458
00:21:01,886 --> 00:21:04,304
What about it?

459
00:21:04,304 --> 00:21:06,099
You know, just a...

460
00:21:04,304 --> 00:21:06,099
(WHOOSHES)

461
00:21:06,099 --> 00:21:07,349
(SMACKS)

462
00:21:07,349 --> 00:21:08,809
(POPS)

463
00:21:21,781 --> 00:21:24,784
WALTER:

464
00:21:21,781 --> 00:21:24,784
So what do you think?

465
00:21:24,784 --> 00:21:26,368
Expensive.

466
00:21:26,368 --> 00:21:28,579
Leaving aside engineering,

467
00:21:28,579 --> 00:21:31,331
rigging some kind of

468
00:21:28,579 --> 00:21:31,331
alternate power source,

469
00:21:31,331 --> 00:21:35,669
my primary sticking point

470
00:21:31,331 --> 00:21:35,669
is I actually need the thing.

471
00:21:35,669 --> 00:21:38,547
As you gentlemen can see,

472
00:21:35,669 --> 00:21:38,547
it's paying the bills.

473
00:21:38,547 --> 00:21:41,801
But I mean it's

474
00:21:38,547 --> 00:21:41,801
feasible, doable?

475
00:21:41,801 --> 00:21:43,469
Hey, we're living

476
00:21:41,801 --> 00:21:43,469
in a time

477
00:21:43,469 --> 00:21:46,305
of, uh, string theories

478
00:21:43,469 --> 00:21:46,305
and God particles.

479
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:49,516
Feasible, doable?

480
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:49,516
Yeah, sure, why not?

481
00:21:49,516 --> 00:21:52,436
Expensive.

482
00:21:52,436 --> 00:21:54,688
What would you

483
00:21:52,436 --> 00:21:54,688
put it in?

484
00:21:59,193 --> 00:22:02,780
What about that?

485
00:21:59,193 --> 00:22:02,780
Does it run?

486
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:04,657
We can get it running.

487
00:22:04,657 --> 00:22:06,993
What's the box

488
00:22:04,657 --> 00:22:06,993
made of?

489
00:22:06,993 --> 00:22:09,078
Plywood and aluminum,

490
00:22:06,993 --> 00:22:09,078
just what you need.

491
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:14,041
All right, so you want

492
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:14,041
to talk money?

493
00:22:15,417 --> 00:22:17,336
Step into my office.

494
00:22:21,507 --> 00:22:23,592
WALTER:

495
00:22:21,507 --> 00:22:23,592
Hey, listen. Um...

496
00:22:24,927 --> 00:22:28,388
I don't actually have

497
00:22:24,927 --> 00:22:28,388
any money right now.

498
00:22:28,388 --> 00:22:32,559
My wife... There's

499
00:22:28,388 --> 00:22:32,559
an IRS issue anyway.

500
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:34,854
I'd appreciate it if you could

501
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:34,854
spot me my share.

502
00:22:34,854 --> 00:22:36,939
I'll pay you back.

503
00:22:36,939 --> 00:22:38,858
Yeah. Whatever.

504
00:22:38,858 --> 00:22:40,526
Right.

505
00:22:42,611 --> 00:22:44,947
You coming?

506
00:22:44,947 --> 00:22:46,324
If you have any brains,

507
00:22:46,324 --> 00:22:48,408
you'll take that money

508
00:22:46,324 --> 00:22:48,408
you saved

509
00:22:48,408 --> 00:22:50,286
and you'll skip town...

510
00:22:50,286 --> 00:22:53,331
Today. Right now.

511
00:22:53,331 --> 00:22:55,291
You don't think

512
00:22:53,331 --> 00:22:55,291
this can work?

513
00:22:55,291 --> 00:22:57,877
Is that

514
00:22:55,291 --> 00:22:57,877
a serious question?

515
00:22:57,877 --> 00:22:59,962
Mike, this is

516
00:22:57,877 --> 00:22:59,962
a three-man job.

517
00:22:59,962 --> 00:23:01,755
The only way I know

518
00:22:59,962 --> 00:23:01,755
it won't work for sure

519
00:23:01,755 --> 00:23:03,841
is if we don't have you.

520
00:23:35,455 --> 00:23:36,916

(WHISPERING) Oh. Get in.

524
00:23:42,546 --> 00:23:44,298
Close the door.

(NORMAL VOICE)

526
00:23:44,298 --> 00:23:47,093
What did we say

527
00:23:44,298 --> 00:23:47,093
about you coming here?

528
00:23:47,093 --> 00:23:49,970
Yeah, speaking of things

529
00:23:47,093 --> 00:23:49,970
that tend to rile you up,

530
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:52,973
uh, the police,

531
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:52,973
they may call.

532
00:23:52,973 --> 00:23:54,558
Let me...

533
00:23:52,973 --> 00:23:54,558
Let me back up a little.

534
00:23:54,558 --> 00:23:57,061
Can I... Can I sit down?

535
00:23:54,558 --> 00:23:57,061
I'm going to sit down.

536
00:23:57,061 --> 00:23:59,688
Okay, why are

537
00:23:57,061 --> 00:23:59,688
the police going to call?

538
00:23:59,688 --> 00:24:02,983
May call you. Distant,

539
00:23:59,688 --> 00:24:02,983
outside possibility,

540
00:24:02,983 --> 00:24:06,070
but on the off-chance, I want

541
00:24:02,983 --> 00:24:06,070
you thinking one thought...

542
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:08,114
<i>Hogan's Heroes.</i>

543
00:24:08,114 --> 00:24:10,116
Sergeant Schultz. Do you

544
00:24:08,114 --> 00:24:10,116
remember Sergeant Schultz?

545
00:24:10,116 --> 00:24:12,368
"I know nothing.

546
00:24:10,116 --> 00:24:12,368
I see nothing."

547
00:24:12,368 --> 00:24:14,954
Do you remember how he...

548
00:24:12,368 --> 00:24:14,954
I want you like that.

549
00:24:14,954 --> 00:24:16,538
Okay, Saul,

550
00:24:14,954 --> 00:24:16,538
why are the police...

551
00:24:16,538 --> 00:24:18,707
There was an incident with

552
00:24:16,538 --> 00:24:18,707

553
00:24:18,707 --> 00:24:20,418
Oh, God.

555
00:24:20,418 --> 00:24:23,003
Oh, Jesus. What incident?

556
00:24:23,003 --> 00:24:24,588
An act of God.

557

(CHUCKLES)

558
00:24:24,588 --> 00:24:26,299
There's no right.

559
00:24:24,588 --> 00:24:26,299
There's no wrong.

560
00:24:26,299 --> 00:24:29,176
I mean, it just...

561
00:24:26,299 --> 00:24:29,176
That's the best phrase.

562
00:24:29,176 --> 00:24:33,722
It fits,

563
00:24:29,176 --> 00:24:33,722
but we got a problem.

564
00:24:38,102 --> 00:24:40,396

565
00:24:40,396 --> 00:24:42,106
Sorry?

566
00:24:42,106 --> 00:24:44,358
Ted is dead?

567
00:24:44,358 --> 00:24:46,986
No. No, no.

568
00:24:46,986 --> 00:24:49,487
He just woke up.

569

OLD JOE: Right-o,

570
00:24:54,243 --> 00:24:57,037
that should do 'er.

571
00:24:57,037 --> 00:24:59,123
All right,

572
00:24:57,037 --> 00:24:59,123
watches off.

573
00:24:59,123 --> 00:25:02,793
Necklaces, earrings,

574
00:24:59,123 --> 00:25:02,793
rings, bracelets...

00:25:02,793 --> 00:25:04,628
Gold.

576
00:25:02,793 --> 00:25:04,628
These are non-ferrous.

577
00:25:04,628 --> 00:25:06,088
Better hope.

578
00:25:06,088 --> 00:25:07,547
What about that stuff

579
00:25:06,088 --> 00:25:07,547
you young guys wear

580
00:25:07,547 --> 00:25:09,175
on the end

581
00:25:07,547 --> 00:25:09,175
or your pricks?

582
00:25:09,175 --> 00:25:12,261
Speak now

583
00:25:09,175 --> 00:25:12,261
or forever sing soprano.

584
00:25:12,261 --> 00:25:13,846
What's up with that,

585
00:25:12,261 --> 00:25:13,846
by the way?

586
00:25:13,846 --> 00:25:15,806
Why would anybody

587
00:25:13,846 --> 00:25:15,806

00:35:43,349 --> 00:35:45,310
the magnet,

784
00:35:43,349 --> 00:35:45,310
or the batteries.

785
00:35:45,310 --> 00:35:48,271
Untraceable salvage,

786
00:35:45,310 --> 00:35:48,271
all of it.

787
00:35:48,271 --> 00:35:50,356
I made sure of that, too.

788
00:35:50,356 --> 00:35:52,109
Well, you got

789
00:35:50,356 --> 00:35:52,109
all the answers,

790
00:35:52,109 --> 00:35:53,610
so you tell me,

791
00:35:52,109 --> 00:35:53,610
Answer Man,

792
00:35:53,610 --> 00:35:55,862
did all that

793
00:35:53,610 --> 00:35:55,862
even work just now?

794
00:35:55,862 --> 00:35:58,531
Yes. It worked.

795
00:35:58,531 --> 00:36:01,284
I'm supposed to

796
00:35:58,531 --> 00:36:01,284
take that on faith?

797
00:36:01,284 --> 00:36:03,120
Yeah?

798
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:04,370
Why?

799
00:36:04,370 --> 00:36:05,831
How do we know?

800
00:36:07,499 --> 00:36:09,584
Because I say so.

801

805
00:36:44,995 --> 00:36:47,497
Undamaged.

810
00:37:00,385 --> 00:37:03,513
Damaged. Glass screen

811
00:37:00,385 --> 00:37:03,513
is broken and in pieces.

812
00:37:03,513 --> 00:37:05,306

814
00:37:17,194 --> 00:37:18,444

(GLASS RATTLES)

818
00:37:20,321 --> 00:37:21,698
Damaged.

819
00:37:21,698 --> 00:37:23,700
The glass is broken,

820
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:25,827
and photo has slipped

821
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:25,827
out of its frame.

822
00:37:25,827 --> 00:37:29,748
Bag appears to be slightly

823
00:37:25,827 --> 00:37:29,748
punctured by broken glass.

824
00:37:30,749 --> 00:37:33,459
Hmm. Check it out.

825
00:37:35,087 --> 00:37:37,005
That's not on the manifest.

826
00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:40,008
SAUL:

827
00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:40,008
All right, so first off,

828
00:37:40,008 --> 00:37:41,467
I'm not

829
00:37:40,008 --> 00:37:41,467
a marriage counselor.

830
00:37:41,467 --> 00:37:43,428
Nor do I take sides

831
00:37:41,467 --> 00:37:43,428
in this thing.

832
00:37:43,428 --> 00:37:45,555
And, not taking sides,

833
00:37:43,428 --> 00:37:45,555
mind you,

834
00:37:45,555 --> 00:37:47,807
but you did put her

835
00:37:45,555 --> 00:37:47,807
in charge of your money,

836
00:37:47,807 --> 00:37:50,810
which I advised against,

837
00:37:47,807 --> 00:37:50,810
if you'll recall,

838
00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:53,813
all of which is not to be

839
00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:53,813
construed as an "I told you so."

840
00:37:53,813 --> 00:37:56,482
I'm just walking you

841
00:37:53,813 --> 00:37:56,482
through my mental process,

842
00:37:56,482 --> 00:37:58,026
so to speak.

843
00:38:01,905 --> 00:38:04,116
So, she comes to me

844
00:38:01,905 --> 00:38:04,116
with a problem.

845
00:38:04,116 --> 00:38:05,700
She's been cooking

846
00:38:04,116 --> 00:38:05,700
Beneke's books,

847
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:07,577
he's in Dutch

848
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:07,577
with the IRS,

849
00:38:07,577 --> 00:38:09,079
and once they audit,

850
00:38:09,079 --> 00:38:11,039
it's<i> rio de caca</i>

851
00:38:09,079 --> 00:38:11,039
for the both of them,

852
00:38:11,039 --> 00:38:15,127
to which I say,

853
00:38:11,039 --> 00:38:15,127
"Hey, let's involve Walt

854
00:38:11,039 --> 00:38:15,127
in this discussion,"

855
00:38:15,127 --> 00:38:18,255
to which she says, "No,

856
00:38:15,127 --> 00:38:18,255
let's cut Beneke a check

857
00:38:18,255 --> 00:38:20,632
"so's he can

858
00:38:18,255 --> 00:38:20,632
pay off the IRS."

859
00:38:20,632 --> 00:38:22,050
Again, not taking sides,

860
00:38:22,050 --> 00:38:25,095
but she really was

861
00:38:22,050 --> 00:38:25,095
trying to protect you.

862
00:38:27,847 --> 00:38:30,391
A little feedback here

863
00:38:27,847 --> 00:38:30,391
might be nice.

864
00:38:32,185 --> 00:38:35,480
"Let's involve Walt

865
00:38:32,185 --> 00:38:35,480
in this discussion."

866
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:37,107
Yeah,

867
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:37,107
that's what I told her.

868
00:38:37,107 --> 00:38:38,650
She said no.

869
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:40,944
And you didn't

870
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:40,944
argue the point.

871
00:38:40,944 --> 00:38:43,196
You didn't think

872
00:38:40,944 --> 00:38:43,196
to contact me.

873
00:38:45,073 --> 00:38:46,699
You were a tad

874
00:38:45,073 --> 00:38:46,699
preoccupied

875
00:38:46,699 --> 00:38:49,161
at the time,

876
00:38:46,699 --> 00:38:49,161
if you'll recall.

877
00:38:49,161 --> 00:38:54,040
Okay. So, you took it

878
00:38:49,161 --> 00:38:54,040
upon yourself

879
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:58,962
to give away $622,000

880
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:58,962
of my money

881
00:38:58,962 --> 00:39:02,174
to a man who had been

882
00:38:58,962 --> 00:39:02,174
sleeping with my wife.

883
00:39:02,174 --> 00:39:06,511
(SIGHS)

884
00:39:02,174 --> 00:39:06,511
She's my client,

885
00:39:02,174 --> 00:39:06,511
same as you.

886
00:39:06,511 --> 00:39:09,514
Does this arrangement get

887
00:39:06,511 --> 00:39:09,514
a little tricky at times?

888
00:39:09,514 --> 00:39:11,224
Absolutely.

889
00:39:11,224 --> 00:39:13,852
But I try my best, you know,

890
00:39:11,224 --> 00:39:13,852
ethically, in my duty...

891
00:39:13,852 --> 00:39:16,021
Ethically?

892
00:39:16,021 --> 00:39:19,024
I'm sorry.

893
00:39:16,021 --> 00:39:19,024
I must be hearing things.

894
00:39:19,024 --> 00:39:23,987
Did you actually just use the

895
00:39:19,024 --> 00:39:23,987
word "ethically" in a sentence?

896
00:39:23,987 --> 00:39:26,614
You're not Clarence Darrow,

897
00:39:23,987 --> 00:39:26,614
Saul.

898
00:39:26,614 --> 00:39:29,034
You're a two-bit

899
00:39:26,614 --> 00:39:29,034
bus-bench lawyer,

900
00:39:29,034 --> 00:39:30,994
and you work for me.

901
00:39:30,994 --> 00:39:33,579
Yeah, well, Clarence Darrow

902
00:39:30,994 --> 00:39:33,579
never had a client like you

903
00:39:33,579 --> 00:39:35,707
ask him for something...

904
00:39:36,958 --> 00:39:38,376
Like this.

905
00:39:38,376 --> 00:39:41,713
Okay? Yeah, I put my ass

906
00:39:38,376 --> 00:39:41,713
on the line for you.

907
00:39:41,713 --> 00:39:43,464
Huell, too. Huh?

908
00:39:43,464 --> 00:39:44,924
He's got fingers

909
00:39:43,464 --> 00:39:44,924
like hotdogs.

910
00:39:44,924 --> 00:39:46,718
He could've easily

911
00:39:44,924 --> 00:39:46,718
busted this in two

912
00:39:46,718 --> 00:39:50,222
and killed everyone

913
00:39:46,718 --> 00:39:50,222
in the office,

914
00:39:46,718 --> 00:39:50,222
but do I complain?

915
00:39:50,222 --> 00:39:52,932
No. Beg, borrow, or steal,

916
00:39:50,222 --> 00:39:52,932
I'm your huckleberry.

917
00:39:52,932 --> 00:39:55,643
I go the extra mile.

918
00:39:55,643 --> 00:40:00,190
Only you never told me

919
00:39:55,643 --> 00:40:00,190
that kid would wind up

920
00:39:55,643 --> 00:40:00,190
in the hospital.

921
00:40:00,190 --> 00:40:02,317
You know...

922
00:40:02,317 --> 00:40:04,903
Take that thing and get

923
00:40:02,317 --> 00:40:04,903
the hell out of here.

924
00:40:04,903 --> 00:40:07,030
You and me, we're done.

925
00:40:22,545 --> 00:40:24,005
What are you...

926
00:40:24,005 --> 00:40:25,924
Come on. Hey.

927
00:40:25,924 --> 00:40:27,259
Hey.

928
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:36,268
We're done

929
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:36,268
when I say we're done.

930

SKYLER: (CHUCKLING)

931
00:41:09,926 --> 00:41:12,511
Yes, you are...

932
00:41:16,515 --> 00:41:19,060
(HOLLY SQUEAKS)

933
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:20,728
Hey.

934
00:41:26,692 --> 00:41:29,195
I heard

935
00:41:26,692 --> 00:41:29,195
what happened to Ted.

936
00:41:30,989 --> 00:41:33,116
He's not going to talk.

937
00:41:33,116 --> 00:41:34,659
Yeah.

938
00:41:59,934 --> 00:42:02,187
I forgive you.
