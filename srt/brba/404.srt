00:09:38,328 --> 00:09:40,539
And at least we'll have laid

197
00:09:38,328 --> 00:09:40,539
the groundwork.

198
00:09:40,539 --> 00:09:43,624
And coming clean

199
00:09:40,539 --> 00:09:43,624
with Hank and Juni--

200
00:09:45,335 --> 00:09:51,299
Appearing to come clean will be

201
00:09:45,335 --> 00:09:51,299
the best thing for everyone.

202
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:54,553
We talked about this.

203
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:54,553
Okay? We agreed about this.

204
00:09:54,553 --> 00:09:58,223
Yes, we did. It's just...

205
00:09:58,223 --> 00:10:00,517
What?

206
00:10:00,517 --> 00:10:03,437
Never mind. Just--

207
00:10:03,437 --> 00:10:05,564
Okay. So...

208
00:10:05,564 --> 00:10:09,150
I really think we should

209
00:10:05,564 --> 00:10:09,150
tag team the narrative, okay?

210
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:11,445
We'll each be responsible

211
00:10:11,445 --> 00:10:14,030
for certain portions

212
00:10:11,445 --> 00:10:14,030
of the story and then we can--

213
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:16,491
We can hand off

214
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:16,491
so we don't leave anything out,

215
00:10:16,491 --> 00:10:18,285
and it'll seem natural.

216
00:10:18,285 --> 00:10:21,455
Okay. So I'm gonna launch

217
00:10:18,285 --> 00:10:21,455
with the exciting news

218
00:10:21,455 --> 00:10:24,458
that we are buying

219
00:10:21,455 --> 00:10:24,458
a car wash.

220
00:10:24,458 --> 00:10:26,126
Yay.

221
00:10:26,126 --> 00:10:29,045
The next logical question

222
00:10:26,126 --> 00:10:29,045
Hank will probably ask is:

223
00:10:29,045 --> 00:10:30,922
"Where are you

224
00:10:29,045 --> 00:10:30,922
getting the money?"

225
00:10:30,922 --> 00:10:32,673
To which I'll say:

226
00:10:32,673 --> 00:10:34,717
We wanna tell you

227
00:10:32,673 --> 00:10:34,717
the whole story.

228
00:10:34,717 --> 00:10:39,139
It's a doozy,

229
00:10:34,717 --> 00:10:39,139
so hold onto your hats.

230
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:40,640
Do you like that?

231
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:44,436
Sure.

232
00:10:44,436 --> 00:10:47,564
It accomplishes two things.

233
00:10:44,436 --> 00:10:47,564
It keeps it light

234
00:10:47,564 --> 00:10:50,150
while letting them know

235
00:10:47,564 --> 00:10:50,150
to expect something big.

236
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:51,610
WALT:

237
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:51,610
Uh-huh.

238
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:55,363
Yeah. No. It's a doozy.

239
00:10:55,363 --> 00:10:58,450
Okay. Anyway, that's where

240
00:10:55,363 --> 00:10:58,450
you will take over,

241
00:10:58,450 --> 00:11:00,118
starting

242
00:10:58,450 --> 00:11:00,118
with your diagnosis.

243
00:11:00,118 --> 00:11:02,579
Pages one and two.

244
00:11:00,118 --> 00:11:02,579
Okay. And it's--

245
00:11:02,579 --> 00:11:04,789
It's gonna run parallel

246
00:11:02,579 --> 00:11:04,789
to the truth,

247
00:11:04,789 --> 00:11:07,375
which makes it easier,

248
00:11:04,789 --> 00:11:07,375
but, um...

249
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:10,003
Just make sure

250
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:10,003
to really hit the cancer.

251
00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:12,297
Really touch on

252
00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:12,297
the fear and despair.

253
00:11:12,297 --> 00:11:15,383
It's good to remind them

254
00:11:12,297 --> 00:11:15,383
and to get their sympathy.

255
00:11:15,383 --> 00:11:18,470
We want them to understand why

256
00:11:15,383 --> 00:11:18,470
you'd do something so stupid.

257
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:25,143
Now, after that, per pages

258
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:25,143
three and four, after you say:

259
00:11:25,143 --> 00:11:28,687
"Gambling became an addiction,

260
00:11:25,143 --> 00:11:28,687
and I just couldn't control it."

261
00:11:28,687 --> 00:11:30,190
Do you see that?

262
00:11:28,687 --> 00:11:30,190
Yes.

263
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:31,774
In the middle. Okay.

264
00:11:31,774 --> 00:11:34,569
I put in that line about

265
00:11:31,774 --> 00:11:34,569
robbery, from the GA meeting.

266
00:11:34,569 --> 00:11:36,321
That was good.

267
00:11:36,321 --> 00:11:39,491
So next, I'll chime in about

268
00:11:36,321 --> 00:11:39,491
how it affected our marriage,

269
00:11:39,491 --> 00:11:42,869
starting with the confusion,

270
00:11:39,491 --> 00:11:42,869
the deceit,

271
00:11:42,869 --> 00:11:44,538
why we couldn't

272
00:11:42,869 --> 00:11:44,538
tell anyone--

273
00:11:44,538 --> 00:11:47,832
I'm terribly, terribly ashamed

274
00:11:44,538 --> 00:11:47,832
of my actions.

275
00:11:47,832 --> 00:11:50,377
Yeah.

276
00:11:47,832 --> 00:11:50,377
Two "terribly"s?

277
00:11:50,377 --> 00:11:53,921
It's to show contrition.

278
00:11:50,377 --> 00:11:53,921
I just wouldn't use that word.

279
00:11:53,921 --> 00:11:56,966
I would never say the word

280
00:11:53,921 --> 00:11:56,966
"terribly."

281
00:11:56,966 --> 00:12:00,970
Phrase it however you want.

282
00:11:56,966 --> 00:12:00,970
You're jumping ahead. Now--

283
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:04,432
And why--?

284
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:04,432
And why am I so ashamed?

285
00:12:04,432 --> 00:12:07,686
Do I really need

286
00:12:04,432 --> 00:12:07,686
to answer that?

287
00:12:08,895 --> 00:12:13,858
I was, and am,

288
00:12:08,895 --> 00:12:13,858
providing for our family.

289
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:18,238
Let's just pick up

290
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:18,238
where we left off.

291
00:12:18,238 --> 00:12:22,116
I'm weak, I'm out of control.

292
00:12:18,238 --> 00:12:22,116
This makes me look like crap.

293
00:12:22,116 --> 00:12:24,994
This has to be

294
00:12:22,116 --> 00:12:24,994
a warts-and-all story.

295
00:12:24,994 --> 00:12:27,414
That's how we'll sell it.

296
00:12:24,994 --> 00:12:27,414
We both look bad.

297
00:12:27,414 --> 00:12:29,790
How do you look bad exactly?

298
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:32,919
Where is the "I slept

299
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:32,919
with my boss" bullet point?

300
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:35,088
I can't seem to find that

301
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:35,088
anywhere.

302
00:12:35,088 --> 00:12:38,508
For a fired schoolteacher

303
00:12:35,088 --> 00:12:38,508
who cooks crystal meth,

304
00:12:38,508 --> 00:12:41,302
I'd say you're coming out

305
00:12:38,508 --> 00:12:41,302
pretty much ahead.

306
00:12:41,302 --> 00:12:44,805
I don't like it. I don't want

307
00:12:41,302 --> 00:12:44,805
Junior thinking less of me.

308
00:12:44,805 --> 00:12:46,516
At least you won

309
00:12:44,805 --> 00:12:46,516
at gambling.

310
00:12:46,516 --> 00:12:50,144
I'm the bitch mom

311
00:12:46,516 --> 00:12:50,144
who wouldn't cut you slack.

312
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:58,528
I'm sorry.

313
00:13:00,321 --> 00:13:02,990
I'm sorry that

314
00:13:00,321 --> 00:13:02,990
I put you through all of this.

315
00:13:06,119 --> 00:13:08,829
How's that sound? Hm?

316
00:13:08,829 --> 00:13:10,331
Here.

317
00:13:13,668 --> 00:13:15,670
Two "sorry"s.

318
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:19,549
I believe

319
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:19,549
we were on page five.

320
00:13:19,549 --> 00:13:22,719
So after you say

321
00:13:19,549 --> 00:13:22,719
how very sorry you are,

322
00:13:22,719 --> 00:13:25,263
in your own words,

323
00:13:22,719 --> 00:13:25,263
of course,

324
00:13:25,263 --> 00:13:26,805
we're almost to the end.

325
00:13:26,805 --> 00:13:29,392
And then I say

326
00:13:26,805 --> 00:13:29,392
how proud I am of you

327
00:13:29,392 --> 00:13:31,352
for joining

328
00:13:29,392 --> 00:13:31,352
a 12-step program.

329
00:13:31,352 --> 00:13:34,939
And this is where

330
00:13:31,352 --> 00:13:34,939
I think we should enact

331
00:13:34,939 --> 00:13:37,066
how we're feeling,

332
00:13:34,939 --> 00:13:37,066
you know?

333
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:39,026
Just a suggestion.

334
00:13:39,026 --> 00:13:44,991
You might look down at the floor

335
00:13:39,026 --> 00:13:44,991
with remorse. Hm?

336
00:13:47,076 --> 00:13:50,705
What?

337
00:13:47,076 --> 00:13:50,705
You don't have to mean it.

338
00:13:50,705 --> 00:13:53,040
You just stare down

339
00:13:50,705 --> 00:13:53,040
at your feet, Walt, okay?

340
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,794
Then I'm gonna...

341
00:13:55,794 --> 00:13:57,754
I was thinking

342
00:13:55,794 --> 00:13:57,754
of taking Marie's hand

343
00:13:57,754 --> 00:14:01,215
and saying something

344
00:13:57,754 --> 00:14:01,215
emotional like:

345
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:03,176
It's such a relief

346
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:03,176
to tell you.

347
00:14:03,176 --> 00:14:06,137
We're glad we have

348
00:14:03,176 --> 00:14:06,137
a strong family to help us.

349
00:14:06,137 --> 00:14:07,930
That we can all

350
00:14:06,137 --> 00:14:07,930
support each other.

351
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:12,018
And then maybe

352
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:12,018
I'll tear up a little.

353
00:14:12,018 --> 00:14:13,770
I don't know.

354
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:15,772
We'll see what happens

355
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:15,772
in the moment.

356
00:14:17,231 --> 00:14:19,233
You're gonna cry on cue?

357
00:14:19,233 --> 00:14:22,111
I said, I don't know.

358
00:14:19,233 --> 00:14:22,111
Maybe.

359
00:14:22,111 --> 00:14:25,072
When you dab your eyes,

360
00:14:22,111 --> 00:14:25,072
with your right hand or left?

361
00:14:25,072 --> 00:14:28,618
One tear? Two tears? How many?

362
00:14:25,072 --> 00:14:28,618
This has to be convincing.

363
00:14:28,618 --> 00:14:31,996
Especially to Hank. I'm doing

364
00:14:28,618 --> 00:14:31,996
the best I can here, Walt.

365
00:14:31,996 --> 00:14:33,914
And yes, I'm thorough.

366
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:40,797
Maybe lying doesn't come

367
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:40,797
as easily to me as you.

[DOORBELL RINGS]

369
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:56,771
Hey.

00:14:56,771 --> 00:14:58,939
Guys! Come on in! Hi!

371
00:14:56,771 --> 00:14:58,939
Hey.

Good to see you!

Hey.

Hey.

00:15:03,444 --> 00:15:05,405
Great to see you.

377
00:15:03,444 --> 00:15:05,405
How you doing?

378
00:15:05,405 --> 00:15:08,074
Look at my little princess.

379
00:15:05,405 --> 00:15:08,074
She's getting big.

380
00:15:08,074 --> 00:15:11,285
Yeah. And heavy too.

381
00:15:08,074 --> 00:15:11,285
Is that food I'm smelling?

382
00:15:11,285 --> 00:15:13,580
I might get

383
00:15:11,285 --> 00:15:13,580
an honest-to-God meal here?

384
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:15,874

Thank you, sweetheart.

386
00:15:15,874 --> 00:15:19,126
Your Aunt Marie, she's cute,

387
00:15:15,874 --> 00:15:19,126

Its most stable state

is plus-two, which is pale pink.
