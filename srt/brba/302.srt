How about if I just push

573
00:26:09,026 --> 00:26:14,365
28,800, um,

574
00:26:14,365 --> 00:26:19,245
out of this into next quarter?

575
00:26:14,365 --> 00:26:19,245
Would you sign it then?

576
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:23,665
Um...

577
00:26:23,665 --> 00:26:30,297
I'm just saying I can't sign it

578
00:26:23,665 --> 00:26:30,297
as it currently exists.

579
00:26:30,297 --> 00:26:32,466
Fair enough.

580
00:26:32,466 --> 00:26:34,343
I'll take care of it.

581
00:26:34,343 --> 00:26:36,845
Thank you for the heads-up.

582
00:26:36,845 --> 00:26:39,681
You won't have to deal

583
00:26:36,845 --> 00:26:39,681
with this again, I swear.

584
00:26:42,101 --> 00:26:44,061
What if your kids found out?

585
00:26:47,356 --> 00:26:49,649
If my kids found out?

586
00:26:49,649 --> 00:26:52,403
This. What you're doing.

588
00:26:52,403 --> 00:26:54,654
be old enough.

589
00:26:54,654 --> 00:26:57,283
How would you explain

590
00:26:54,654 --> 00:26:57,283
it to them?

591
00:27:00,702 --> 00:27:04,123
Well, put me on the spot,

592
00:27:00,702 --> 00:27:04,123
why don't you?

593
00:27:05,665 --> 00:27:08,710
I guess maybe I'd, um...

594
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:12,172
I'd say that, uh,

595
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:12,172
I might have feet of clay,

596
00:27:12,172 --> 00:27:14,967
but that whatever I did,

597
00:27:12,172 --> 00:27:14,967
I did thinking of them.

598
00:27:14,967 --> 00:27:18,636
You know, trying to provide.

599
00:27:18,636 --> 00:27:23,976
And I'd ask them to try to take

600
00:27:18,636 --> 00:27:23,976
the time to understand...

You know what? Truth is,

603
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:29,898
I haven't thought

604
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:29,898
that far ahead, Skyler.

605
00:27:29,898 --> 00:27:33,777
I'm just trying to keep

606
00:27:29,898 --> 00:27:33,777
my head above water, so...

607
00:27:33,777 --> 00:27:35,988
I'd better get back to it.

Oh, God.

610
00:27:48,959 --> 00:27:50,544
Hi, Walt.

611
00:27:50,544 --> 00:27:54,381
Listen, I can't tal--

612
00:27:50,544 --> 00:27:54,381
I'm at work right now--

613
00:27:54,381 --> 00:27:55,924
What?

614
00:27:55,924 --> 00:27:59,094
Louis dropped him off.

615
00:27:55,924 --> 00:27:59,094
He was here when I got home.

616
00:27:59,094 --> 00:28:00,513
No, no, no, of course.

617
00:28:00,513 --> 00:28:03,015
No, he's not staying.

618
00:28:00,513 --> 00:28:03,015
He understands that.

619
00:28:03,015 --> 00:28:05,392
I'll bring him anywhere

620
00:28:03,015 --> 00:28:05,392

Well, yeah. It is rush hour.

to Beneke now.

00:28:13,942 --> 00:28:17,196

00:28:13,942 --> 00:28:17,196
it be easier if we--?

00:28:17,196 --> 00:28:21,033
Right, okay, good.

Okay, bye.

Why are you doing this?

She's just trying to keep me

634
00:28:25,703 --> 00:28:29,667
from seeing you

635
00:28:29,667 --> 00:28:31,585
and you're helping her.

Well, son, I mean, your mother,

637
00:28:31,585 --> 00:28:37,757
she has her reasons.

638
00:28:37,757 --> 00:28:39,968
What reasons?

639
00:28:42,054 --> 00:28:44,598
They're, uh...

00:28:44,598 --> 00:28:47,142
Well, they're...

00:28:48,686 --> 00:28:52,189
Well, they're just a little

642
00:28:48,686 --> 00:28:52,189
difficult to delineate.

643
00:28:52,189 --> 00:28:56,068

00:28:52,189 --> 00:28:56,068
there are two sides

to every story, always.

646
00:28:59,779 --> 00:29:01,740
But she, uh...

647
00:29:03,701 --> 00:29:05,327
Yeah.

00:29:06,953 --> 00:29:12,084

is your home

and that is where

00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:17,005
you belong, okay?

00:29:17,005 --> 00:29:21,510

661
00:29:34,523 --> 00:29:40,070
taking sides, though.

How can you let her

663
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:43,490
treat you like this?

Come on.

00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:47,035
How can you just take it?

668
00:29:50,163 --> 00:29:51,707

with how we feel

00:30:17,483 --> 00:30:20,152
And I'll take you home.

683
00:30:23,947 --> 00:30:28,910
Let me first just

684
00:30:23,947 --> 00:30:28,910
hit the old bathroom here.

685
00:30:46,762 --> 00:30:49,181
Hello. Good afternoon.

00:30:49,181 --> 00:30:52,017
Nice to meet you. Saul Goodman.

00:30:49,181 --> 00:30:52,017
MR. PINKMAN: Nice to meet you.

00:30:52,017 --> 00:30:55,312

690
00:30:55,312 --> 00:30:59,024
Better call Saul! Ha, ha, ha.

691
00:30:55,312 --> 00:30:59,024
Ha, ha.

692
00:30:59,024 --> 00:31:00,818
I get it all the time.

00:31:00,818 --> 00:31:05,572
of the property at 9809 Margo.

00:31:05,572 --> 00:31:09,034
I get it. Flat-fee clients,

696
00:31:05,572 --> 00:31:09,034
am I right?

697
00:31:09,034 --> 00:31:11,995
Well, folks,

698
00:31:09,034 --> 00:31:11,995
today's your lucky day.

699
00:31:11,995 --> 00:31:15,833
I represent a client

700
00:31:11,995 --> 00:31:15,833
who shall remain nameless.

701
00:31:15,833 --> 00:31:17,501
However, for our purposes,

702
00:31:17,501 --> 00:31:21,046
you might just as well visualize

703
00:31:17,501 --> 00:31:21,046
a large bag of money.

704

706
00:31:25,509 --> 00:31:28,512
Cash?

707
00:31:25,509 --> 00:31:28,512
Cash. I know, in this economy.

708
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:30,972
In fact, the money

709
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:30,972
is already burning a hole

710
00:31:30,972 --> 00:31:33,767
in my client's account.

711
00:31:30,972 --> 00:31:33,767
You can ask Mr. Gardiner.

712
00:31:33,767 --> 00:31:36,102
I've shown him

713
00:31:33,767 --> 00:31:36,102
the pertinent financials.

714
00:31:36,102 --> 00:31:38,522
It's the only reason

715
00:31:36,102 --> 00:31:38,522
we're sitting here.

716
00:31:38,522 --> 00:31:41,983
Fair enough. We get a few papers

717
00:31:38,522 --> 00:31:41,983
signed and notarized,

718
00:31:41,983 --> 00:31:43,985
we can take care

719
00:31:41,983 --> 00:31:43,985
of this right now.

720
00:31:43,985 --> 00:31:47,072
In fact, I could wire you

721
00:31:43,985 --> 00:31:47,072
your money this very afternoon.

722
00:31:47,072 --> 00:31:50,909
There's just one

723
00:31:47,072 --> 00:31:50,909
little hair in the soup.

724
00:31:50,909 --> 00:31:52,994
The price.

725
00:31:55,914 --> 00:31:59,835
We feel 875 is very fair.

726
00:31:59,835 --> 00:32:03,255
But I suppose there's always

727
00:31:59,835 --> 00:32:03,255
a little, uh, wiggle room.

728
00:32:03,255 --> 00:32:07,426
Well, why don't you wiggle

729
00:32:03,255 --> 00:32:07,426
us on down to 400

730
00:32:07,426 --> 00:32:09,595
and you got yourselves a deal?

731
00:32:09,595 --> 00:32:13,515
Four hundred thousand?

732
00:32:09,595 --> 00:32:13,515
What is that, a joke?

733
00:32:13,515 --> 00:32:15,768
No, that's my offer.

734
00:32:15,768 --> 00:32:17,728
That's less than half-price.

735
00:32:17,728 --> 00:32:20,522
We put almost that much

736
00:32:17,728 --> 00:32:20,522
into the renovations alone.

737
00:32:20,522 --> 00:32:22,982
Why don't we just cut

738
00:32:20,522 --> 00:32:22,982
the clown act

739
00:32:22,982 --> 00:32:25,527
and you tell us what you're

740
00:32:22,982 --> 00:32:25,527
willing to come up to?

741
00:32:25,527 --> 00:32:28,405
Four hundred thousand.

742
00:32:25,527 --> 00:32:28,405
That's my final offer.

743
00:32:28,405 --> 00:32:30,490
This is a waste of time.

744
00:32:28,405 --> 00:32:30,490
Ridiculous.

745
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:32,826
How could you imagine

746
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:32,826
we'd entertain this?

747
00:32:32,826 --> 00:32:34,077
Come on.

748
00:32:34,077 --> 00:32:35,537
I thought some allowance

749
00:32:34,077 --> 00:32:35,537
was in order

750
00:32:35,537 --> 00:32:37,997
once I heard about the meth lab.

751
00:32:37,997 --> 00:32:40,166
The one that used

752
00:32:37,997 --> 00:32:40,166
to be in the basement.

753
00:32:40,166 --> 00:32:42,961
I looked over your signed

754
00:32:40,166 --> 00:32:42,961
disclosure statements

755
00:32:42,961 --> 00:32:45,631
and I don't see any mention

756
00:32:42,961 --> 00:32:45,631
of a meth lab. Nope.

757
00:32:45,631 --> 00:32:48,717
Oh, you got your termite

758
00:32:45,631 --> 00:32:48,717
inspection. That's good.

759
00:32:48,717 --> 00:32:50,343
But no meth lab.

760
00:32:50,343 --> 00:32:53,388
Now, some would call that fraud

761
00:32:53,388 --> 00:32:55,933
in service of concealing

762
00:32:53,388 --> 00:32:55,933
a felony.

763
