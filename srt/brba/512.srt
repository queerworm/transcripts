00:12:05,559 --> 00:12:07,644
in the best interest

198
00:12:07,644 --> 00:12:10,480
of all of our continued

199
00:12:07,644 --> 00:12:10,480
good health,

200
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,190
I don't think

201
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,190
we can stay here.

202
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:14,526
I mean,

203
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:14,526
not until we get new carpet.

204
00:12:14,526 --> 00:12:16,695
Yeah.

205
00:12:16,695 --> 00:12:20,865
Uncle Hank and Aunt Marie,

206
00:12:16,695 --> 00:12:20,865
they got plenty of space.

207
00:12:20,865 --> 00:12:22,283
Hey, what about a hotel?

208
00:12:22,283 --> 00:12:25,036
A hotel.

209
00:12:22,283 --> 00:12:25,036
That could be sweet.

210
00:12:25,036 --> 00:12:26,705
A good one.

211
00:12:26,705 --> 00:12:29,290
I like the way

212
00:12:26,705 --> 00:12:29,290
you're thinking. Yes.

213
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:31,292
Could be

214
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:31,292
a little family vacation.

215
00:12:31,292 --> 00:12:33,002
Might be fun. What do you say?

216
00:12:33,002 --> 00:12:35,088
Why don't you put

217
00:12:33,002 --> 00:12:35,088
some clothes together?

218
00:12:35,088 --> 00:12:37,424
Yeah. All right.

219
00:12:39,259 --> 00:12:42,679
I'm sorry.

220
00:12:39,259 --> 00:12:42,679
It's not my finest hour.

221
00:12:43,971 --> 00:12:45,348
I'll go pack a bag.

222
00:12:45,348 --> 00:12:46,933
Okay.

223
00:12:45,348 --> 00:12:46,933
Okay.

224
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:52,272
Think this'll leave a scar?

225
00:12:56,443 --> 00:13:00,280
I never should have let

226
00:12:56,443 --> 00:13:00,280
my dojo membership run out.

227
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:07,704
Jesus.

228
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:07,704
Jesse did that?

229
00:13:07,704 --> 00:13:11,583
Yeah, but you gotta understand,

230
00:13:07,704 --> 00:13:11,583
deep down he loves me.

231
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:14,961
So, where is he?

232
00:13:14,961 --> 00:13:18,005
Still looking.

233
00:13:14,961 --> 00:13:18,005
WALT: Where have you looked?

234
00:13:18,005 --> 00:13:22,469
His place, his folk's place,

235
00:13:18,005 --> 00:13:22,469
this Brock kid's place.

236
00:13:22,469 --> 00:13:27,474
Crack shacks at Siesta Hills,

237
00:13:22,469 --> 00:13:27,474
the Indigo, the Crystal Palace,

238
00:13:27,474 --> 00:13:30,435
go-kart joint on Copper Ave,

239
00:13:30,435 --> 00:13:32,103
AA meeting off the 40.

240
00:13:32,103 --> 00:13:34,606
His buddies,

241
00:13:32,103 --> 00:13:34,606
Beaver and what's-his-name?

242
00:13:34,606 --> 00:13:37,942
Badger and Skinny Pete.

243
00:13:34,606 --> 00:13:37,942
Yeah, no, he's not with them.

244
00:13:37,942 --> 00:13:39,736
WALT:

245
00:13:37,942 --> 00:13:39,736
They could be

246
00:13:37,942 --> 00:13:39,736
covering for him.

247
00:13:39,736 --> 00:13:41,321
I posed as a meter reader.

248
00:13:41,321 --> 00:13:43,364
I put a bug

249
00:13:41,321 --> 00:13:43,364
on the tall kid's mom's place.

250
00:13:43,364 --> 00:13:45,032
For three hours straight,

251
00:13:45,032 --> 00:13:47,786
all he talked about was

252
00:13:45,032 --> 00:13:47,786
something called<i> Babylon 5.</i>

253
00:13:47,786 --> 00:13:50,079
I checked with

254
00:13:47,786 --> 00:13:50,079
my gal at A.P.D.

255
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:51,748
She said Pinkman's

256
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:51,748
not in their system

257
00:13:51,748 --> 00:13:53,708
so the cops don't have him.

258
00:13:51,748 --> 00:13:53,708
Yet.

259
00:13:53,708 --> 00:13:56,252
Maybe he changed his mind

260
00:13:53,708 --> 00:13:56,252
about leaving,

261
00:13:56,252 --> 00:13:57,712
called your guy back.

262
00:13:57,712 --> 00:14:00,381
Somebody misses

263
00:13:57,712 --> 00:14:00,381
their first chance with my guy,

264
00:14:00,381 --> 00:14:01,716
there's no second.

265
00:14:01,716 --> 00:14:04,511
Well, keep looking.

266
00:14:04,511 --> 00:14:07,138
What then?

267
00:14:07,138 --> 00:14:08,389
What do you mean?

268
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:10,475
I mean, Pinkman's

269
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:10,475
like a bad penny.

270
00:14:10,475 --> 00:14:12,143
Sooner or later,

271
00:14:10,475 --> 00:14:12,143
he'll turn up.

272
00:14:12,143 --> 00:14:15,854
I'm wondering what you

273
00:14:12,143 --> 00:14:15,854
wanna do when he does.

274
00:14:15,854 --> 00:14:18,024
Jesse is upset about the boy.

275
00:14:18,024 --> 00:14:21,778
I just need to explain to him

276
00:14:18,024 --> 00:14:21,778
why that had to happen.

277
00:14:24,947 --> 00:14:28,409
Okay, but say, you know,

278
00:14:24,947 --> 00:14:28,409
just for the sake of argument,

279
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:31,746
the kid's not in the mood

280
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:31,746
for a nuanced discussion

281
00:14:31,746 --> 00:14:33,832
of the virtues

282
00:14:31,746 --> 00:14:33,832
of child poisoning.

283
00:14:33,832 --> 00:14:37,126
His plans are running more

284
00:14:33,832 --> 00:14:37,126
towards stabbing you to death

285
00:14:37,126 --> 00:14:40,880
with a pointed stick.

286
00:14:37,126 --> 00:14:40,880
In that scenario, then what?

287
00:14:42,215 --> 00:14:43,758
You have a suggestion?

288
00:14:43,758 --> 00:14:46,636
We were wondering if maybe

289
00:14:46,636 --> 00:14:50,139
this isn't an Old Yeller

290
00:14:46,636 --> 00:14:50,139
type situation.

291
00:14:51,474 --> 00:14:53,518
Old Yeller?

292
00:14:53,518 --> 00:14:57,230
Yeah, Old Yeller was the best,

293
00:14:53,518 --> 00:14:57,230
most loyal dog there ever was.

294
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:59,357
I mean,

295
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:59,357
everybody loved that mutt

296
00:14:59,357 --> 00:15:02,193
but one day,

297
00:14:59,357 --> 00:15:02,193
he showed up rabid,

298
00:15:02,193 --> 00:15:06,239
and little Timmy,

299
00:15:02,193 --> 00:15:06,239
for Old Yeller's own sake,

300
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:08,032
had to, uh...

301
00:15:09,075 --> 00:15:10,827
Oh, you--

302
00:15:09,075 --> 00:15:10,827
You saw the movie.

303
00:15:12,495 --> 00:15:16,082
You're full of colorful

304
00:15:12,495 --> 00:15:16,082
metaphors, aren't you, Saul?

305
00:15:16,082 --> 00:15:18,752
Belize, Old Yeller...

306
00:15:18,752 --> 00:15:20,795
Just brimming with advice.

307
00:15:26,634 --> 00:15:29,846
Do not float that idea again.

308
00:15:32,348 --> 00:15:34,058
Find him.

309
00:15:47,864 --> 00:15:50,533
WALT:

310
00:15:47,864 --> 00:15:50,533
Sorry. Ah. Sorry.

311
00:15:50,533 --> 00:15:52,827
Room key wouldn't

312
00:15:50,533 --> 00:15:52,827
let me into the ice room

313
00:15:52,827 --> 00:15:56,330
so I had to go down

314
00:15:52,827 --> 00:15:56,330
to the front desk.

315
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:58,374
But here we are.

316
00:15:58,374 --> 00:16:00,251
Checked in on Junior.

317
00:16:00,251 --> 00:16:02,295
Heh. Pay-per-view

318
00:16:00,251 --> 00:16:02,295
and room service.

319
00:16:02,295 --> 00:16:03,880
He's in heaven.

320
00:16:06,006 --> 00:16:08,342
Hey, I thought you

321
00:16:06,006 --> 00:16:08,342
were gonna take a bath.

322
00:16:08,342 --> 00:16:10,595
How's Saul doing?

323
00:16:11,554 --> 00:16:15,141
Saul? Goodman?

324
00:16:17,894 --> 00:16:19,103
No idea.

325
00:16:19,103 --> 00:16:21,355
No?

326
00:16:21,355 --> 00:16:24,400
You were just out talking to him

327
00:16:21,355 --> 00:16:24,400
in the parking lot.

328
00:16:27,027 --> 00:16:30,573
I'm sorry.

329
00:16:27,027 --> 00:16:30,573
Were you spying on me?

330
00:16:31,616 --> 00:16:32,992
Yes.

331
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:35,995
And I feel just awful

332
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:35,995
about it too.

333
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:37,747
You know, I played along

334
00:16:37,747 --> 00:16:39,874
with your pump malfunction

335
00:16:37,747 --> 00:16:39,874
bullshit

336
00:16:39,874 --> 00:16:42,209
because Junior

337
00:16:39,874 --> 00:16:42,209
was standing right there,

338
00:16:42,209 --> 00:16:46,422
but now I would like to know

339
00:16:42,209 --> 00:16:46,422
what's going on.

340
00:16:51,845 --> 00:16:54,764
First of all,

341
00:16:51,845 --> 00:16:54,764
it's no big deal.

342
00:16:54,764 --> 00:16:57,934
Coming here is just me

343
00:16:54,764 --> 00:16:57,934
being overly cautious.

344
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:06,066
Jesse Pinkman, remember?

345
00:17:06,066 --> 00:17:11,405
He came over to our house

346
00:17:06,066 --> 00:17:11,405
that time for dinner, remember?

347
00:17:11,405 --> 00:17:15,785
Well, he...

348
00:17:11,405 --> 00:17:15,785
He got upset over this...

349
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:19,956
Something he thinks I did.

350
00:17:20,999 --> 00:17:22,249
I did do it.

351
00:17:22,249 --> 00:17:24,168
But I did it

352
00:17:22,249 --> 00:17:24,168
for very good reasons.

353
00:17:24,168 --> 00:17:26,420
And it's just--

354
00:17:24,168 --> 00:17:26,420
It's complicated.

355
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:28,589
Wait, are you...?

356
00:17:29,757 --> 00:17:33,219
Are you telling me

357
00:17:29,757 --> 00:17:33,219
that he tried to

358
00:17:33,219 --> 00:17:34,595
burn our house down?

359
00:17:34,595 --> 00:17:36,973
That was...

360
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:42,353
probably, for a brief moment,

361
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:42,353
his intention,

362
00:17:42,353 --> 00:17:45,439
but, obviously,

363
00:17:42,353 --> 00:17:45,439
he changed his mind.

364
00:17:45,439 --> 00:17:48,943
And how does that work?

365
00:17:48,943 --> 00:17:51,738
Him--?

366
00:17:48,943 --> 00:17:51,738
Him changing his mind?

367
00:17:51,738 --> 00:17:53,614
Ah, God.

368
00:17:54,949 --> 00:17:56,450
Look...

369
00:17:59,871 --> 00:18:02,289
You've got to understand

370
00:17:59,871 --> 00:18:02,289
that with Jesse,

371
00:18:02,289 --> 00:18:07,086
there are emotional issues,

372
00:18:02,289 --> 00:18:07,086
personal issues,

373
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:09,171
some drug abuse. But he has

374
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:09,171
always been

375
00:18:09,171 --> 00:18:12,299
more of a danger to himself

376
00:18:09,171 --> 00:18:12,299
than anyone else.

377
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:18,472
He has a tendency to

378
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:18,472
fly off the handle, that's all.

379
00:18:18,472 --> 00:18:22,518
So he has never hurt anybody?

380
00:18:25,897 --> 00:18:27,398
No.

381
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:32,070
I can't believe

382
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:32,070
you got her down so fast.

383
00:18:38,451 --> 00:18:40,036
So...

384
00:18:41,245 --> 00:18:44,206
what's your course of action

385
00:18:41,245 --> 00:18:44,206
here?

386
00:18:46,834 --> 00:18:49,378
Saul's guy, Kuby,

387
00:18:46,834 --> 00:18:49,378
tracks him down,

388
00:18:49,378 --> 00:18:51,422
which shouldn't take long,

389
00:18:51,422 --> 00:18:54,050
