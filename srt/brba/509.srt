00:44:15,403 --> 00:44:17,530
about family!

962
00:44:23,869 --> 00:44:26,831
Hank, my cancer is back.

963
00:44:26,831 --> 00:44:29,834
Good.

964
00:44:29,834 --> 00:44:33,171
Rot, you son of a bitch.

965
00:44:33,171 --> 00:44:35,423
I'm sorry

966
00:44:33,171 --> 00:44:35,423
you feel that way.

967
00:44:36,466 --> 00:44:38,968
I wanna beat this thing,

968
00:44:36,466 --> 00:44:38,968
I do.

969
00:44:38,968 --> 00:44:42,388
I'm back on chemo,

970
00:44:38,968 --> 00:44:42,388
and I am fighting like hell.

971
00:44:44,474 --> 00:44:47,185
But the truth is,

972
00:44:44,474 --> 00:44:47,185
in six months,

973
00:44:47,185 --> 00:44:50,647
you won't have someone

974
00:44:47,185 --> 00:44:50,647
to prosecute.

975
00:44:52,023 --> 00:44:54,233
But even--

976
00:44:54,233 --> 00:44:59,572
Even if somehow you were

977
00:44:54,233 --> 00:44:59,572
able to convince anyone

978
00:45:00,823 --> 00:45:03,909
that I was capable

979
00:45:00,823 --> 00:45:03,909
of doing these things,

980
00:45:03,909 --> 00:45:06,703
you and I both know

981
00:45:06,703 --> 00:45:10,041
I would never see

982
00:45:06,703 --> 00:45:10,041
the inside of a jail cell.

983
00:45:14,546 --> 00:45:17,048
I'm a dying man

984
00:45:17,048 --> 00:45:18,841
who runs a car wash.

985
00:45:18,841 --> 00:45:23,680
My right hand to God,

986
00:45:18,841 --> 00:45:23,680
that is all that I am.

987
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:30,186
What's the point?

988
00:45:35,024 --> 00:45:38,319
Have Skyler

989
00:45:35,024 --> 00:45:38,319
bring the kids here.

990
00:45:38,319 --> 00:45:41,197
And then we'll talk.

991
00:45:44,450 --> 00:45:47,245
That is not going to happen.

992
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,211
I don't know who you are.

993
00:45:57,213 --> 00:46:00,299
I don't even know

994
00:45:57,213 --> 00:46:00,299
who I'm talking to.

995
00:46:03,469 --> 00:46:06,180
If that's true...

996
00:46:07,306 --> 00:46:11,018
if you don't know who I am...

997
00:46:13,104 --> 00:46:18,234
then maybe your best course...

998
00:46:19,527 --> 00:46:22,572
would be to tread lightly.

999
00:46:42,550 --> 00:46:44,761
