No, it's there.

00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:10,207
No. Revenue most definitely

00:35:05,645 --> 00:35:07,647
Walter's formula.

777
00:35:07,647 --> 00:35:13,111
Can you produce his product

778
00:35:07,647 --> 00:35:13,111
without any help? Alone.

779
00:35:13,111 --> 00:35:14,821
No.

780
00:35:17,824 --> 00:35:19,618
Why?

781
00:35:19,618 --> 00:35:23,872
You're asking me if I can cook

782
00:35:19,618 --> 00:35:23,872
Mr. White's crystal?

783
00:35:23,872 --> 00:35:26,374

00:35:28,627 --> 00:35:30,963

787
00:35:30,963 --> 00:35:33,673
and dump in the desert

788
00:35:30,963 --> 00:35:33,673
a month ago?

789
00:35:33,673 --> 00:35:36,051
This your plan? Huh?

790
00:35:36,051 --> 00:35:37,469
Invite me in your house,

791
00:35:37,469 --> 00:35:40,221
make whatever this is...

792
00:35:41,514 --> 00:35:48,146
be my buddy, and make me

793

feel important.

794
00:35:48,146 --> 00:35:51,858

00:35:51,858 --> 00:35:54,611

You wanna--

798
00:35:56,404 --> 00:35:59,116
You wanna talk like men?

799
00:35:59,116 --> 00:36:00,826
Let's talk like men.

800
00:36:00,826 --> 00:36:05,455
You kill Mr. White, you're gonna

801
00:36:00,826 --> 00:36:05,455
have to kill me too.

that dude we brought to the lab.

852
00:39:21,609 --> 00:39:24,237
I mean, they shot him

853
00:39:21,609 --> 00:39:24,237
right in front of me.

854
00:39:24,237 --> 00:39:26,572
I mean, just

855
00:39:24,237 --> 00:39:26,572
blew his head open.

856
00:39:26,572 --> 00:39:30,076
I mean, some sniper nailed him

857
00:39:26,572 --> 00:39:30,076
from like a mile away.

858
00:39:31,494 --> 00:39:34,580

868
00:39:45,342 --> 00:39:49,679
So, Gus is gonna cave.

869
00:39:49,679 --> 00:39:53,766
So the cartel wants half

870
00:39:49,679 --> 00:39:53,766
of Gus' entire operation,

871
00:39:53,766 --> 00:39:56,144

872
00:39:53,766 --> 00:39:56,144
your formula.

873
00:39:56,144 --> 00:39:57,645
And he's gonna

874
00:39:56,144 --> 00:39:57,645
give it to them.

875
00:39:57,645 --> 00:39:59,981
Well, I-- I gotta

876
00:39:57,645 --> 00:39:59,981
give it to them.

877
00:39:59,981 --> 00:40:02,775
I mean, I'm supposed

878
00:39:59,981 --> 00:40:02,775
to go to Mexico and--

879
00:40:02,775 --> 00:40:05,320
And teach a bunch

880
00:40:02,775 --> 00:40:05,320
of cartel chemists

881

You know,

884
00:40:08,531 --> 00:40:10,449
and Gus doesn't trust you,

885
00:40:10,449 --> 00:40:11,701
so I gotta go.

886
00:40:11,701 --> 00:40:13,995
I mean,

887
00:40:11,701 --> 00:40:13,995
you're the chemist, man.

888
00:40:13,995 --> 00:40:17,790
You know, not-- Not me.

889
00:40:13,995 --> 00:40:17,790
I mean, let's say I go down to--

890
00:40:17,790 --> 00:40:22,045
You know, go over there-- Go--

891
00:40:17,790 --> 00:40:22,045
Go to the jungle or whatever,

892
00:40:22,045 --> 00:40:24,630
you know, and they got

893
00:40:22,045 --> 00:40:24,630
like actual chemists,

894
00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:27,926
like cartel chemists

895
00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:27,926
asking me chemistry stuff

896
00:40:27,926 --> 00:40:31,096
that I don't know how

897
00:40:27,926 --> 00:40:31,096
to answer because I'm not you.

898
00:40:31,096 --> 00:40:33,014
And what if, like,

899
00:40:31,096 --> 00:40:33,014
all the equipment

900
00:40:33,014 --> 00:40:36,226
is in Mexican

901
00:40:33,014 --> 00:40:36,226
instead of English?

902
00:40:36,226 --> 00:40:38,561
You know? Oh!

903
00:40:38,561 --> 00:40:40,146
I don't know.

904
00:40:38,561 --> 00:40:40,146
I don't know.

905
00:40:40,146 --> 00:40:43,649
I mean, if--

906
00:40:40,146 --> 00:40:43,649
If I mess this up,

907
00:40:43,649 --> 00:40:47,404
I am dead, you know?

908
00:40:43,649 --> 00:40:47,404
All of us.

909
00:40:50,198 --> 00:40:52,491

910
00:40:50,198 --> 00:40:52,491

911
00:40:52,491 --> 00:40:54,369
I need your help.

912
00:40:54,369 --> 00:40:56,413
Okay, maybe you could--

913
00:40:56,413 --> 00:41:00,333
Maybe you could, like, coach me

914
00:40:56,413 --> 00:41:00,333
or something, you know.

915
00:41:00,333 --> 00:41:03,920
Or you can, like,

916
00:41:00,333 --> 00:41:03,920
give me some notes.

917
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:06,005
Mr. White?

918
00:41:07,006 --> 00:41:08,967
So you saw Gus?

919
00:41:10,385 --> 00:41:11,970
What? No.

920
00:41:11,970 --> 00:41:14,055
You didn't see Gus.

921
00:41:14,055 --> 00:41:15,848
No.

922
00:41:15,848 --> 00:41:19,269
Then who told you

923
00:41:15,848 --> 00:41:19,269
all of that?

924
00:41:19,269 --> 00:41:22,188
It was-- It was passed down,

925
00:41:19,269 --> 00:41:22,188
like I said.

926
00:41:23,481 --> 00:41:26,651
"Passed down." By whom?

927
00:41:26,651 --> 00:41:28,987
By, uh--

928
00:41:26,651 --> 00:41:28,987
By Mike and them.

929
00:41:28,987 --> 00:41:30,405
I mean, they did. They--

930
00:41:30,405 --> 00:41:33,741
So "they"

931
00:41:30,405 --> 00:41:33,741
doesn't include Gus.

932
00:41:33,741 --> 00:41:35,327
You haven't been with Gus.

933
00:41:35,327 --> 00:41:38,413
You haven't seen Gus.

934
00:41:35,327 --> 00:41:38,413
You haven't spoken to Gus.

935
00:41:38,413 --> 00:41:39,831
Why are you--?

936
00:41:39,831 --> 00:41:42,125
You weren't at Gus' house

937
00:41:39,831 --> 00:41:42,125
last night.

938
00:41:42,125 --> 00:41:43,960
What?

939
00:41:45,462 --> 00:41:48,547
What the hell? Jesus.

940
00:41:50,049 --> 00:41:52,969
Still here.

941
00:41:52,969 --> 00:41:54,387
It's still here.

942

Jesus.

943
00:42:00,352 --> 00:42:03,271
You look me in the eye

944
00:42:00,352 --> 00:42:03,271
and you tell me

945
00:42:03,271 --> 00:42:05,898
that you weren't at his house

946
00:42:03,271 --> 00:42:05,898
last night.

947
00:42:07,317 --> 00:42:10,111
I, um...

948
00:42:10,111 --> 00:42:14,240
Look, I didn't have a chance,

949
00:42:10,111 --> 00:42:14,240
all right?

950
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:16,409
Okay? I knew you would

951
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:16,409
react this way.

952
00:42:16,409 --> 00:42:19,496
I knew you would freak out

953
00:42:16,409 --> 00:42:19,496
and wouldn't believe me.

954
00:42:19,496 --> 00:42:22,915
That's-- That's why I didn't

955
00:42:19,496 --> 00:42:22,915
say anything.

956
00:42:22,915 --> 00:42:26,419
Look, there was just this one

957
00:42:22,915 --> 00:42:26,419
big pot of stew, okay?

958
00:42:26,419 --> 00:42:29,088
He just made this one big pot

959
00:42:26,419 --> 00:42:29,088
and we both ate from it.

960
00:42:29,088 --> 00:42:32,050
What was I supposed to do, huh?

961
00:42:29,088 --> 00:42:32,050
Poison myself?

962
00:42:32,050 --> 00:42:33,801
Two hours and 18 minutes,

963
00:42:33,801 --> 00:42:36,179
and you couldn't figure out

964
00:42:33,801 --> 00:42:36,179
a way to give it to him?

965
00:42:36,179 --> 00:42:38,639
He never left the room.

966
00:42:36,179 --> 00:42:38,639
You lying little shit!

967
00:42:38,639 --> 00:42:42,143
You had one thing to do,

968
00:42:38,639 --> 00:42:42,143
one thing.

That is the only thing,

970
00:42:42,143 --> 00:42:44,103
I might add,

971
00:42:44,103 --> 00:42:45,938
that would save our lives.

972
00:42:45,938 --> 00:42:49,108
And you were right there.

973
00:42:45,938 --> 00:42:49,108
You were in his house.

974
00:42:49,108 --> 00:42:51,569
And you didn't have

975
00:42:49,108 --> 00:42:51,569
the guts to do it.

978
00:42:58,493 --> 00:43:01,787
of killing him, did you?

How did you know

980
00:43:01,787 --> 00:43:05,333
I was at his house last night?

981
00:43:05,333 --> 00:43:07,126
Were you following me?

982
00:43:10,463 --> 00:43:11,923
This.

00:43:11,923 --> 00:43:14,050

984

did you?
