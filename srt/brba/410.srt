But that's upwards of 6300

388
00:20:53,377 --> 00:20:57,464
that won't be going to the IRS.

389
00:20:57,464 --> 00:20:59,341
I just thought

390
00:20:57,464 --> 00:20:59,341
you might like to know,

391
00:20:59,341 --> 00:21:02,845
loath as I am to say,

392
00:20:59,341 --> 00:21:02,845
I told you so.

393
00:21:08,601 --> 00:21:10,561
Where is he now?

396
00:22:08,494 --> 00:22:10,288
Hey.

397
00:22:13,666 --> 00:22:15,542
How you doing?

398
00:22:17,795 --> 00:22:19,672
Good.

399
00:22:27,345 --> 00:22:30,683
Um, how are you?

400
00:22:30,683 --> 00:22:34,520
I'm fine, but your mother

401
00:22:30,683 --> 00:22:34,520
is going to be worried sick.

402
00:22:36,354 --> 00:22:37,857
I called her last night.

403
00:22:39,025 --> 00:22:40,860
Oh, God.

404
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:45,072
I told her I was

405
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:45,072
spending the night at Louis'.

406
00:22:45,072 --> 00:22:48,951
It's cool. So...

407
00:22:48,951 --> 00:22:51,745
Uh, how are you?

408
00:22:53,122 --> 00:22:54,456
[SIGHS]

409
00:22:54,456 --> 00:22:57,710
I'm fine, son. I...

410
00:23:00,796 --> 00:23:02,589
I...

411
00:23:03,674 --> 00:23:05,801
Well, I...

412
00:23:05,801 --> 00:23:10,139
I took these painkillers that

413
00:23:05,801 --> 00:23:10,139
I had left over from my surgery,

414
00:23:10,139 --> 00:23:13,017
and I made

415
00:23:10,139 --> 00:23:13,017
the brilliant decision

416
00:23:13,017 --> 00:23:16,478
to wash them down

417
00:23:13,017 --> 00:23:16,478
with a couple of beers.

418
00:23:17,813 --> 00:23:21,650
Not my most sterling moment,

419
00:23:17,813 --> 00:23:21,650
I admit, but...

420
00:23:23,194 --> 00:23:24,611
I'm fine.

421
00:23:24,611 --> 00:23:27,489
I wish I could take back

422
00:23:24,611 --> 00:23:27,489
last night.

423
00:23:27,489 --> 00:23:30,243
It was your birthday.

424
00:23:27,489 --> 00:23:30,243
This shouldn't be on your mind.

425
00:23:30,243 --> 00:23:33,204
It's okay.

426
00:23:30,243 --> 00:23:33,204
No, it's not okay.

427
00:23:33,204 --> 00:23:34,621
I'm your father,

428
00:23:34,621 --> 00:23:39,001
and I don't want

429
00:23:34,621 --> 00:23:39,001
last night to be...

430
00:23:39,001 --> 00:23:43,256
I mean, you really...

431
00:23:44,215 --> 00:23:48,386
can't think of me like...

432
00:23:48,386 --> 00:23:50,971
Like what?

433
00:23:53,766 --> 00:23:57,686
I-- I don't understand.

434
00:24:09,156 --> 00:24:11,325
My father died when I was 6.

435
00:24:11,325 --> 00:24:14,328
You knew that, right?

436
00:24:11,325 --> 00:24:14,328
Yeah.

437
00:24:16,705 --> 00:24:19,959
He had Huntington's disease.

438
00:24:16,705 --> 00:24:19,959
It's...

439
00:24:21,585 --> 00:24:25,298
It destroys

leads to dementia,

00:24:27,258 --> 00:24:30,970
it's just a nasty disease.

444
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:32,972
It's genetic.

445
00:24:32,972 --> 00:24:35,182
Terrified my mother

446
00:24:32,972 --> 00:24:35,182
that I might have it,

447
00:24:35,182 --> 00:24:38,894
so they ran tests on me

448
00:24:35,182 --> 00:24:38,894
when I was a kid,

449
00:24:38,894 --> 00:24:40,687
but I came up clean.

450
00:24:42,106 --> 00:24:46,484
My father fell very ill

451
00:24:42,106 --> 00:24:46,484
when I was...

452
00:24:46,484 --> 00:24:48,195
four or 5.

453
00:24:48,195 --> 00:24:51,782
He spent a lot of time

454
00:24:48,195 --> 00:24:51,782
in the hospital.

455
00:24:51,782 --> 00:24:53,742
My...

456
00:24:55,328 --> 00:24:56,912
[LAUGHS]

457
00:24:56,912 --> 00:25:00,458
My mother would tell me

458
00:24:56,912 --> 00:25:00,458
so many stories about my father.

459
00:25:01,708 --> 00:25:05,129
She would talk about him

460
00:25:01,708 --> 00:25:05,129
all the time.

461
00:25:05,129 --> 00:25:07,798
I knew about his personality,

462
00:25:07,798 --> 00:25:09,675
how he treated people.

463
00:25:09,675 --> 00:25:12,011
I even knew

464
00:25:09,675 --> 00:25:12,011
how he liked his steaks cooked.

465
00:25:12,011 --> 00:25:13,304
Medium rare.

466
00:25:13,304 --> 00:25:15,555
Just like you.

467
00:25:17,099 --> 00:25:21,103
I knew things about my father.

468
00:25:21,103 --> 00:25:22,729
I had a lot of information.

469
00:25:22,729 --> 00:25:26,484
It's because people

470
00:25:22,729 --> 00:25:26,484
would tell me these things.

471
00:25:26,484 --> 00:25:29,903
They would paint this picture

472
00:25:29,903 --> 00:25:33,199
of my father for me.

473
00:25:33,199 --> 00:25:38,162
And I always pretended

474
00:25:33,199 --> 00:25:38,162
that was who I saw too.

475
00:25:38,162 --> 00:25:41,957
Who I remembered.

476
00:25:38,162 --> 00:25:41,957
But it was a lie.

477
00:25:41,957 --> 00:25:46,753
In truth, I only have one real

478
00:25:46,753 --> 00:25:50,090
actual memory of my father.

479
00:25:52,301 --> 00:25:55,304
It must have been

480
00:25:52,301 --> 00:25:55,304
right before he died.

481
00:25:55,304 --> 00:25:58,307
My mother would take me

482
00:25:55,304 --> 00:25:58,307
to the hospital to visit him.

483
00:25:58,307 --> 00:26:02,269
And I remember the smell

484
00:25:58,307 --> 00:26:02,269
in there, the chemicals.

485
00:26:02,269 --> 00:26:05,105
It was as if they used up

486
00:26:05,105 --> 00:26:07,941
every single cleaning product

487
00:26:05,105 --> 00:26:07,941
they could find

488
00:26:07,941 --> 00:26:10,861
in a 50-mile radius.

489
00:26:10,861 --> 00:26:14,823
Like they didn't want you

490
00:26:10,861 --> 00:26:14,823
smelling the sick people.

491
00:26:14,823 --> 00:26:18,576
There was this stench

492
00:26:14,823 --> 00:26:18,576
of Lysol and bleach.

493
00:26:18,576 --> 00:26:21,579
I mean, you could just feel it

494
00:26:18,576 --> 00:26:21,579
coating your lungs.

495
00:26:21,579 --> 00:26:26,419
Anyway, there lying on the bed

496
00:26:26,419 --> 00:26:28,586
is my father.

497
00:26:30,548 --> 00:26:32,758
He's all...

498
00:26:32,758 --> 00:26:35,219
He's all twisted up.

499
00:26:37,179 --> 00:26:39,432
And my mom, she...

500
00:26:40,682 --> 00:26:42,809
puts me on her lap.

501
00:26:42,809 --> 00:26:44,770
She's sitting on the bed

502
00:26:42,809 --> 00:26:44,770
next to him

503
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:47,731
so I can get

504
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:47,731
a good look at him.

505
00:26:48,732 --> 00:26:52,069
But really, he just scares me.

506
00:26:54,530 --> 00:26:58,033
And he's looking

507
00:26:54,530 --> 00:26:58,033
right at me,

508
00:26:59,493 --> 00:27:03,956
but I can't even be sure

509
00:26:59,493 --> 00:27:03,956
that he knows who I am.

510
00:27:08,419 --> 00:27:12,381
And your grandmother

511
00:27:08,419 --> 00:27:12,381
is talking,

512
00:27:12,381 --> 00:27:16,469
trying to be cheerful,

513
00:27:12,381 --> 00:27:16,469
you know, as she does,

514
00:27:16,469 --> 00:27:19,846
but the only thing

515
00:27:16,469 --> 00:27:19,846
I could remember

516
00:27:19,846 --> 00:27:23,683
is him breathing.

517
00:27:25,227 --> 00:27:28,021
Ah. This...

518
00:27:29,189 --> 00:27:33,068
This rattling sound.

519
00:27:33,068 --> 00:27:37,490
Like if you were shaking

520
00:27:33,068 --> 00:27:37,490
an empty spray paint can.

521
00:27:42,995 --> 00:27:46,123
Like there was nothing in him.

522
00:27:50,628 --> 00:27:52,338
Anyway...

523
00:27:55,174 --> 00:28:00,220
that is the only real memory

524
00:27:55,174 --> 00:28:00,220
that I have of my father.

525
00:28:03,849 --> 00:28:06,185
I don't want you to think of me

526
00:28:06,185 --> 00:28:08,937
the way I was

527
00:28:06,185 --> 00:28:08,937
last night.

528
00:28:10,772 --> 00:28:12,732
I don't want that

529
00:28:12,732 --> 00:28:17,237
to be the memory

530
00:28:12,732 --> 00:28:17,237
you have of me when I'm gone.

531
00:28:17,237 --> 00:28:20,698
Remembering you

532
00:28:17,237 --> 00:28:20,698
that way...

533
00:28:22,951 --> 00:28:25,787
wouldn't be so bad.

534
00:28:27,498 --> 00:28:31,960
The bad way to remember you

535
00:28:27,498 --> 00:28:31,960
would be the way...

536
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:35,255
The way you've been

537
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:35,255
this whole last year.

538
00:28:36,590 --> 00:28:39,718
At least last night

539
00:28:36,590 --> 00:28:39,718
you were...

540
00:28:39,718 --> 00:28:43,722
You were real, you know?

541
00:28:50,604 --> 00:28:53,566
Bye.

542
00:28:50,604 --> 00:28:53,566
Bye.

543
00:29:21,801 --> 00:29:24,638
Somewhere you should be?

544
00:29:27,391 --> 00:29:30,102
Well, basically

545
00:29:27,391 --> 00:29:30,102
it was a temporary hiatus.

546
00:29:30,102 --> 00:29:34,314
Give us two weeks, we will

547
00:29:30,102 --> 00:29:34,314
be up and running 100 percent.

548
00:29:34,314 --> 00:29:37,901
All right, talk to your people

549
00:29:34,314 --> 00:29:37,901
and get back to me, okay?

550
00:29:39,486 --> 00:29:41,405
Hi.

551
00:29:39,486 --> 00:29:41,405
Yeah, thanks, Tanya.

552
00:29:41,405 --> 00:29:44,366
Okay. You bet.

553
00:29:41,405 --> 00:29:44,366
Say hi to the kids for me.

554
00:29:44,366 --> 00:29:47,327
Hey.

555
00:29:44,366 --> 00:29:47,327
Hi.

556
00:29:47,327 --> 00:29:49,955
Nice surprise. What's up?

557
00:29:49,955 --> 00:29:52,499
Just thought I'd swing by,

558
00:29:49,955 --> 00:29:52,499
see how things are going.

559
00:29:52,499 --> 00:29:56,002
Well, things are...

560
00:29:52,499 --> 00:29:56,002
Things took a turn.

561
00:29:56,002 --> 00:29:58,380
It's kind of crazy.

562
00:29:56,002 --> 00:29:58,380
Oh, yeah?

563
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:01,383
The universe is telling me

564
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:01,383
something. I got good news.

565
00:30:01,383 --> 00:30:04,553
Some very good news,

566
00:30:01,383 --> 00:30:04,553
and, um...

567
00:30:04,553 --> 00:30:07,055
I'm getting the business

568
00:30:04,553 --> 00:30:07,055
going again.

569
00:30:08,098 --> 00:30:09,391
Wow.

570
00:30:09,391 --> 00:30:11,518
I figure

571
00:30:09,391 --> 00:30:11,518
we haven't been down long,

572
00:30:11,518 --> 00:30:14,896
so we should be able to get

573
00:30:11,518 --> 00:30:14,896
most of our contracts back. Sit.

574
00:30:14,896 --> 00:30:17,399
Oh, thank you.

575
00:30:14,896 --> 00:30:17,399
That's--

576
00:30:17,399 --> 00:30:20,902
Um, gosh, that's...

577
00:30:20,902 --> 00:30:22,529
That's-- Wow.

578
00:30:22,529 --> 00:30:24,948
How is that even possible?

579
00:30:24,948 --> 00:30:28,910

601
00:31:09,117 --> 00:31:12,746

602
00:31:09,117 --> 00:31:12,746
I should hire someone good

603
00:31:12,746 --> 00:31:14,790

604
00:31:12,746 --> 00:31:14,790

00:31:14,790 --> 00:31:17,793

00:31:14,790 --> 00:31:17,793

00:31:17,793 --> 00:31:20,295
The deal is

608
00:31:17,793 --> 00:31:20,295
you pay your back taxes,

609
00:31:20,295 --> 00:31:23,382
you pay your penalty,

610
00:31:20,295 --> 00:31:23,382

611

00:31:33,559 --> 00:31:35,435

619
00:31:35,435 --> 00:31:38,271

621
00:31:38,271 --> 00:31:41,650

625
00:31:45,111 --> 00:31:46,405

I'm just saying that,

629

00:31:55,789 --> 00:31:57,833
