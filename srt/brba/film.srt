I'm out.

8

So, what are you gonna do
with all that money?

9
00:01:14,125 --> 00:01:16,250
Same thing I do with all the other money.

10

Whatever that means.

53
00:03:57,333 --> 00:04:00,041
You couldn't drive a short bus
full of slow kids to the zoo.

54
00:04:00,333 --> 00:04:02,458
Yeah, because I'd be
too distracted by you.

55
00:04:02,541 --> 00:04:04,541
You'd be sitting up front,
in your special helmet,

56

trying to hump my leg.

57
00:04:06,625 --> 00:04:10,500
On account you couldn't drive
Thelma and Louise off of that cliff. Apex!

58

I can't apex more
than I'm already apexing.

You drive like a blind guy with no legs.

you drive like my dead grandmoms.

176
00:13:08,833 --> 00:13:10,833

[brakes squeal]

178
00:13:20,958 --> 00:13:21,833
Hey.

179
00:13:23,416 --> 00:13:25,541
-Where's the victim?
-It's in the back.

180
00:13:25,875 --> 00:13:29,041
Look, thank you so much
for doing this, Joe.

181
00:13:29,625 --> 00:13:31,125
About the money, if we can maybe--

182
00:13:31,208 --> 00:13:32,458
It's on the house.

183
00:13:35,708 --> 00:13:36,708
Good kid.

184
00:13:37,208 --> 00:13:38,333
Least I can do.

185
00:13:44,416 --> 00:13:45,625
[Skinny Pete] Watch it, bitch!

186
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:48,291
[Joe] You gentlemen threw me
plenty of business back in the day.

187
00:13:48,375 --> 00:13:50,666
-[beeps]
-I got no complaints in that department. 

188
00:13:51,375 --> 00:13:53,083
"Magnets!"

189
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:54,041
Yeah.

190
00:13:54,666 --> 00:13:56,375
That was a good one. So...

191
00:13:57,166 --> 00:13:59,583
Frankly, you know, I can tell you now,

192
00:14:01,083 --> 00:14:02,750
I had zero confidence that
that would work.

193
00:14:02,833 --> 00:14:06,375
None whatsoever, but hey, live and learn.

194
00:14:06,458 --> 00:14:07,666
Joe, what are you doing?

195
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:09,791
Writing myself a little insurance policy. 

196
00:14:10,208 --> 00:14:11,875
You know, strictly precautionary.

197
00:14:12,875 --> 00:14:14,250
Belt and suspenders. 

198
00:14:15,333 --> 00:14:16,208
Okay.

199
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:20,666
All right, mind at ease, think we're good.

200
00:14:21,125 --> 00:14:22,875
-[rapid beeping]
-Whoa.

201
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:28,541
Joe! Joe!

202
00:14:31,208 --> 00:14:32,166
[panting] Wait.

205

LoJack. The company just activated it,
just this minute.

206
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:44,250
Talk about timing.

-Just--
-Look, Johnny Law is on his way, 

208
00:14:47,291 --> 00:14:48,791
as in here, as in now.

209
00:14:48,875 --> 00:14:51,083
So farewell, goodbye, regrets,

211
00:14:53,291 --> 00:14:54,208
[Jesse] Joe!

212
00:15:05,666 --> 00:15:06,541
Skinny...

[sighs]

214
00:15:11,083 --> 00:15:12,041
Sorry.

215
00:15:12,375 --> 00:15:13,833
Who's got the keys to that car?

216
00:15:14,791 --> 00:15:15,708
Keys!

217
00:15:29,083 --> 00:15:32,000
Yo. Yo! What are you doing?
We gotta get this thing outta here.

218
00:15:32,083 --> 00:15:34,208
[snapping]
Badger, give me the keys to your Fiero.

219
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:35,208
[Badger] Why?

220
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:37,375
[Badger sighs]

221
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:38,375
You take my car.

222
00:15:38,458 --> 00:15:39,833
I don't even like your car.

223
00:15:40,541 --> 00:15:41,708
Drives like a dick.

224
00:15:41,791 --> 00:15:45,041
Badger drives my T-bird
200, 300 miles away and ditches it.

225
00:15:45,125 --> 00:15:46,750
Think you'll be heading to Mexico?

226
00:15:46,833 --> 00:15:48,208
[Jesse] No, not Mexico.

227
00:15:48,666 --> 00:15:49,916
Right on, even better.

228
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,125
Leave it near the border.

229
00:15:51,208 --> 00:15:52,166
Hide it, kind of,

230
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:55,000
but, yo, don't hide it so good
the cops can't find it.

231
00:15:55,083 --> 00:15:57,250
Wipe it down for prints,
then hitchhike back.

232
00:15:57,333 --> 00:15:59,333
Do not let nobody see you in that car.

233
00:15:59,666 --> 00:16:01,958
-You, take Badger's Fiero.
-What about this car?

234
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:03,833
It stays right here.

235
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:06,666
Ain't like the cops
don't already know where it is. 

236
00:16:06,916 --> 00:16:10,125
I'll tell 'em you dropped by,
the two of us smoked a fat bowl,

237
00:16:10,208 --> 00:16:12,041
traded pink slips, then you split.

238
00:16:13,333 --> 00:16:15,333
I always wanted me an El Camino.

239
00:16:15,416 --> 00:16:16,916
And that's church, yo.

240
00:16:17,458 --> 00:16:19,375
I'll pass any lie detector they give me.

241
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:21,916
It's what's happening.

242
00:16:24,291 --> 00:16:25,458
You got any cash?

243
00:16:34,083 --> 00:16:35,458
Yo. Kick in, bitch.

244
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:37,541
I'm doing it. Jesus!

245
00:16:42,375 --> 00:16:44,250
Guys, I don't know what to say.

246
00:16:44,708 --> 00:16:46,708
Don't say nothing. Just go.

Seat belt. Speed limit.

249
00:17:06,833 --> 00:17:09,666
You got about three hours
to get this thing down south.

250
00:17:10,625 --> 00:17:12,625
I'll keep my mouth shut till then,
but after that,

251
00:17:12,708 --> 00:17:14,500
they gonna be putting a APB out
on this bitch.

252
00:17:14,583 --> 00:17:15,708
I'll get her there.

253
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:18,791
Take care of her, Jesse.

254
00:17:18,916 --> 00:17:20,208
She's a special lady.

255
00:17:21,333 --> 00:17:23,083
That right there is a clown car.

256
00:17:23,166 --> 00:17:26,541
No self-respecting outlaw
would ever get caught dead in that thing. 

257

Hold up.

263
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:06,916
Just might keep you from getting spotted.

264
00:18:07,833 --> 00:18:08,916
Can't hurt, right?

265
00:18:13,583 --> 00:18:14,625
[Jesse] Yo, Skinny.

266
00:18:17,166 --> 00:18:18,333
Why you doing all this?

267
00:18:23,458 --> 00:18:24,416

Sixty percent today. 

296
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,291

00:23:16,375 --> 00:23:20,250
Yeah. Uncle Jack took everybody down
to Elephant Butte,

314
00:23:20,333 --> 00:23:23,625
on account of he got this new Chaparral.

It's pretty bad-ass,

316
00:23:25,416 --> 00:23:26,666
but I told him...

317
00:23:27,291 --> 00:23:29,750
I'm not really big into waterskiing,

318
00:23:29,833 --> 00:23:31,208

gotta take care of you.

I'd really like your help with something.

00:23:56,583 --> 00:23:58,583
I-- I hate to be all like...

327
00:23:59,291 --> 00:24:01,875
But we gotta talk ground rules.

328
00:24:02,291 --> 00:24:05,416
Uh, if you tried to, you know, escape,

00:24:06,416 --> 00:24:08,375
I'm gonna have to visit the little boy.

331
00:24:10,208 --> 00:24:12,416
out of my hands at that point.

332
00:24:12,916 --> 00:24:15,791
Uncle Jack made you that promise,

333
00:24:16,583 --> 00:24:18,666
and he's gonna want to stick to it.

334
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:20,166

00:24:20,791 --> 00:24:22,583

00:24:24,833 --> 00:24:25,750

a couple years ago 'cause of...

00:26:24,625 --> 00:26:25,708

You picked up a couple of windbreakers
at the Army & Navy store,

710
01:00:03,125 --> 01:00:06,375
came strolling in, all clever and shit. 

711
01:00:07,833 --> 01:00:09,208
Well, I know where it is.

712
01:00:09,583 --> 01:00:12,375
And I guaran-fucking-tee
you won't find it on your own.

713
01:00:13,041 --> 01:00:14,000
[exhales]

714
01:00:15,625 --> 01:00:17,208
[knocking]

715
01:00:17,833 --> 01:00:21,250
[Lou] Detectives? Louis Schanzer, unit 11.

716
01:00:21,333 --> 01:00:23,458
I got somethin' that might be helpful. 

717
01:00:24,916 --> 01:00:25,750
Hello?

718
01:00:28,750 --> 01:00:30,916
Detectives? Everything okay?

719
01:00:31,666 --> 01:00:33,166
[door opens]

720
01:00:33,958 --> 01:00:36,333
Uh, sorry about that, sir. We're...

721
01:00:37,500 --> 01:00:40,791
dusting for fingerprints, you know?
It's a delicate process.

722
01:00:40,875 --> 01:00:42,750
I thought your CSI boys do that. 

723
01:00:42,833 --> 01:00:44,625
Didn't they get 'em all yesterday?

724
01:00:44,916 --> 01:00:48,625
Yeah, well, you know, sometimes,
you want something done right--

725
01:00:48,708 --> 01:00:50,291
Oh, God, tell me about it. 

726
01:00:50,375 --> 01:00:53,125
My line was restaurant 
and hospitality supplies, 

727
01:00:53,208 --> 01:00:54,708
so I completely get it.

728
01:00:55,166 --> 01:00:59,375
Hey, listen, I just came across
an old note Todd Alquist wrote me.

729
01:00:59,458 --> 01:01:01,458
-Figured it may be of interest.
-Oh, really?

730
01:01:01,541 --> 01:01:02,375
Yeah.

731
01:01:02,583 --> 01:01:05,750
Sort of a half-assed apology
he slipped under my door.

732
01:01:06,041 --> 01:01:09,041
I'd gone to our landlord
about this stupid truck cap of his

733
01:01:09,125 --> 01:01:11,083
everybody kept tripping over, and--

734
01:01:11,791 --> 01:01:15,916
Well, anyway, if you need
a handwriting sample for analysis.

735
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,208
That's-- Yeah, yeah, that could be...

736
01:01:18,500 --> 01:01:20,125
-Yeah, sure.
-Left it inside.

737
01:01:20,208 --> 01:01:23,083
Didn't want to touch it,
speaking of fingerprints.

738
01:01:23,666 --> 01:01:25,416
You're welcome to come examine it. 

739
01:01:27,750 --> 01:01:29,750
Oh, it's no trouble. I got time.

740
01:01:41,166 --> 01:01:43,250
Show me the money, I let you go.

741
01:01:46,208 --> 01:01:47,041
Hey.

742
01:01:47,583 --> 01:01:49,000
What do you say, huh?

743
01:01:49,625 --> 01:01:50,875
Seems pretty fair to me.

744
01:01:52,416 --> 01:01:53,625
[thuds]

745
01:02:06,500 --> 01:02:08,500
[quietly grunting]

746
01:02:17,166 --> 01:02:19,125
Oh, shit!

747
01:02:19,875 --> 01:02:22,291
-Holy shit!
-Keep your voice down.

748
01:02:22,375 --> 01:02:24,458
[groans] God, there's gotta be...

749
01:02:25,208 --> 01:02:27,750
there's gotta be a million here. Yeah.

750
01:02:32,083 --> 01:02:32,958
[grunts]

751
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:38,208
What are you doing?

752
01:02:40,541 --> 01:02:42,583
-Taking my half.
-[Neil] Wow.

753
01:02:42,666 --> 01:02:44,333
[chuckling] Yeah?

754
01:02:45,083 --> 01:02:47,541
A little man with big dreams? Yeah?

755
01:02:47,958 --> 01:02:49,666
Hey, if I were you,

756
01:02:50,333 --> 01:02:52,166
I'd walk the hell outta here right now.

757
01:02:56,708 --> 01:02:58,458
I'll shoot you, you son of a bitch.

758
01:03:02,166 --> 01:03:03,916
I will shoot you.

759
01:03:04,500 --> 01:03:05,625
Then do it already.

760
01:03:08,625 --> 01:03:10,500
If I don't get this money, 

761
01:03:10,916 --> 01:03:12,416
I am dead anyway.

762
01:03:12,791 --> 01:03:14,708
All right? If you pull that trigger, 

763
01:03:14,958 --> 01:03:19,000
then you are gonna have to kill
that loudmouth down the hall

764
01:03:19,083 --> 01:03:21,416
and every other witness in the place.

765
01:03:21,708 --> 01:03:25,208
Then you will be as fucked as I am. 

766
01:03:27,375 --> 01:03:28,333
So...

767
01:03:30,250 --> 01:03:31,458
what's it gonna be?

768
01:03:44,916 --> 01:03:48,291
Three-way split. And you got your third. 

769
01:03:50,083 --> 01:03:50,958
Don't push it.

770
01:04:14,541 --> 01:04:15,958
[beeps]

771
01:04:16,541 --> 01:04:18,083
[ringing]

772
01:04:18,291 --> 01:04:20,416
-[Casey] <i>Yep?</i>
-Don't react, just listen. 

773
01:04:21,375 --> 01:04:23,375
<i>I got the money.</i>

774
01:04:23,833 --> 01:04:25,833
<i>You gotta keep him talking</i>
<i>for the next five minutes.</i>

775
01:04:25,916 --> 01:04:27,375
Since I got the Brita,

776
01:04:27,666 --> 01:04:30,500
I find the tea tastes noticeably better.

777
01:04:31,166 --> 01:04:32,458
Not a problem.

778
01:05:17,166 --> 01:05:19,166
You got balls, I'll give you that.

779
01:05:20,875 --> 01:05:22,291
Can I get my gun back?

780
01:05:23,041 --> 01:05:25,458
Fuck you. Go buy one.

781
01:05:53,625 --> 01:05:56,000
I was wondering
when you were gonna remember me.

782
01:06:03,333 --> 01:06:04,333
[keys jangling]

783
01:06:07,166 --> 01:06:08,958
[engine starts]

784
01:06:32,083 --> 01:06:33,791
[brakes squeal]

785
01:07:31,750 --> 01:07:33,041
[tires screech]

786
01:07:53,708 --> 01:07:56,208
[panting]

787
01:08:03,458 --> 01:08:06,250
[woman]<i> It's colorful, I'll say that much.</i>

788
01:08:07,083 --> 01:08:08,250
[man] Yes, it is.

789
01:08:08,416 --> 01:08:11,208
Uh, I don't expect
you'd ever lose it in your closet.

790
01:08:11,833 --> 01:08:14,750
Mm. And no dirt bag to replace?

791
01:08:14,833 --> 01:08:15,916
[man] That's correct.

792
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,916
A lot of our customers find that handy
and practical.

793
01:08:19,583 --> 01:08:22,208
But they want an arm and a leg
to pay for it.

794
01:08:22,291 --> 01:08:24,333
And I ain't paying for no paint job.

795
01:08:24,458 --> 01:08:26,666
Yes, I agree. It's very expensive. 

796
01:08:26,750 --> 01:08:28,250
But it's a fine product. 

797
01:08:28,750 --> 01:08:31,291
However, if you are in love
with your Kirby,

798
01:08:31,375 --> 01:08:33,666
I'll bet I could get it
working for you again.

799
01:08:34,416 --> 01:08:36,291
Uh, be with you in a minute.

800
01:08:37,125 --> 01:08:39,833
Fixing my Kirby,
how much would that cost?

801
01:08:40,333 --> 01:08:44,000
Well, I won't know
until I take a good look at it, and it...

802
01:08:44,541 --> 01:08:47,625
and if it needed a new motor,
it'd be a little bit expensive,

803
01:08:47,750 --> 01:08:50,916
but certainly not as expensive
as a new Dyson. 

804
01:08:51,333 --> 01:08:53,750
The estimate's free, and...

805
01:08:53,916 --> 01:08:55,625
all you gotta do is bring it in here.

806
01:08:55,875 --> 01:08:57,791
-I may take you up on that.
-Excellent.

807
01:08:57,875 --> 01:09:01,041
If I can get my niece to help me.
They make 'em so heavy.

808
01:09:01,125 --> 01:09:02,166
Yes, they do, 

809
01:09:02,250 --> 01:09:04,958
and I want you to promise
you won't try to bring it in by yourself.

810
01:09:05,041 --> 01:09:06,833
-Get that help.
-[woman] Hm.

811
01:09:07,916 --> 01:09:11,291
I just don't know why they can't
make things to last anymore.

812
01:09:11,416 --> 01:09:13,416
Oh! You're singing my song.

813
01:09:13,500 --> 01:09:14,666
[woman chuckles]

814
01:09:15,166 --> 01:09:16,708
[man] I want you to have a great day now.

815
01:09:16,791 --> 01:09:19,250
Thank you, thanks for your help.
I'll be back with my Kirby.

816
01:09:19,333 --> 01:09:21,333
[man] Excellent. Drive carefully.

817
01:09:23,833 --> 01:09:26,583
If there's any questions I can answer,
just let me know.

818
01:09:45,083 --> 01:09:47,041
I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't do that.

819
01:09:48,041 --> 01:09:49,375
I'm open for business.

820
01:09:54,416 --> 01:09:56,000
Um, I'm looking for a...

821
01:09:56,958 --> 01:09:58,041
Hoover Max.

822
01:09:59,083 --> 01:10:00,833
Pressure Max, Max Pressure. 

823
01:10:00,916 --> 01:10:02,541
Hoover, or maybe it's a Pro Max.

824
01:10:02,625 --> 01:10:04,333
Got like a-- like a filter.

825
01:10:05,875 --> 01:10:08,541
Hoover products are right over there
on the wall behind you.

826
01:10:08,625 --> 01:10:10,958
Look, I don't remember
the exact, like, password. 

827
01:10:11,416 --> 01:10:13,083
All right? But it was a vacuum thing.

828
01:10:16,583 --> 01:10:17,666
Okay, fine.

829
01:10:18,666 --> 01:10:19,625
Here you go.

830
01:10:24,500 --> 01:10:25,416
Four...

831
01:10:26,041 --> 01:10:26,916
six...

832
01:10:28,916 --> 01:10:29,750
ten...

833
01:10:33,125 --> 01:10:34,291
fourteen,

834
01:10:34,791 --> 01:10:36,791
sixteen, eighteen,

835
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:39,250
twenty, twenty-two...

836
01:10:41,250 --> 01:10:43,041
twenty-four, twenty-five.

837
01:10:43,375 --> 01:10:44,416
There you go.

838
01:10:44,750 --> 01:10:46,000
$125,000.

839
01:10:47,791 --> 01:10:49,500
Come on, man, you know why I'm here.

840
01:10:50,791 --> 01:10:52,708
I can't say I do, no.

841
01:10:52,791 --> 01:10:55,000
Yeah, you do. You're the guy. 

842
01:10:56,708 --> 01:10:58,125
Yeah, you do. 

843
01:10:58,458 --> 01:10:59,791
You're the guy.

844
01:11:02,041 --> 01:11:04,583
Look, I am 96 percent sure
that you are the guy,

845
01:11:04,666 --> 01:11:06,500
so why don't you just, like, admit it?

846
01:11:08,500 --> 01:11:09,458
[slams hand]

847
01:11:09,583 --> 01:11:11,708
Look, all right, no wire.

848
01:11:12,041 --> 01:11:13,833
Okay? No wire.

849
01:11:14,125 --> 01:11:15,208
And no gun.

850
01:11:15,291 --> 01:11:17,208
Okay? And nobody knows I'm here. 

851
01:11:17,666 --> 01:11:18,583
I just need...

852
01:11:19,291 --> 01:11:20,833
just need your services.

853
01:11:21,625 --> 01:11:24,541
The day at the pickup spot,
you pulled up in a minivan,

854
01:11:24,625 --> 01:11:26,458
a red Toyota minivan.

855
01:11:26,541 --> 01:11:27,958
Looks like a kidney bean.

856
01:11:28,041 --> 01:11:30,833
Same exact minivan
you got parked out back.

857
01:11:30,916 --> 01:11:32,458
All right? I saw it.

858
01:11:34,333 --> 01:11:36,000
[sighs] All right.

859
01:11:36,833 --> 01:11:38,833
You got rules. All right.

860
01:11:40,041 --> 01:11:43,250
I get that, and I apologize, seriously. 

861
01:11:43,500 --> 01:11:46,000
I didn't go with you that day,
and I am sorry.

862
01:11:47,458 --> 01:11:50,583
Look, you will never know how sorry,

863
01:11:50,875 --> 01:11:53,083
but I am here now.

864
01:11:53,833 --> 01:11:55,333
All right? And I have cash.

865
01:11:56,333 --> 01:11:57,583
So, please?

866
01:11:58,083 --> 01:11:58,916
Okay?

867
01:11:59,291 --> 01:12:00,333
Please?

868
01:12:08,708 --> 01:12:11,791
-You owe me for that first pickup.
-Yes! [exclaims]

869
01:12:11,875 --> 01:12:13,000
You're the gu--

870
01:12:13,375 --> 01:12:15,583
-Wait, what?
-This...

871
01:12:17,833 --> 01:12:19,750
is previously-owed.

872
01:12:21,875 --> 01:12:23,125
Going forward,

873
01:12:24,583 --> 01:12:25,791
were we to,

874
01:12:27,166 --> 01:12:30,541
would require an additional 125.

875
01:12:36,166 --> 01:12:37,041
All right.

876
01:12:37,333 --> 01:12:38,375
Fair is fair.

877
01:12:39,958 --> 01:12:41,041
A deal's a deal.

878
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:43,583
All right. Look...

879
01:12:44,041 --> 01:12:45,083
Four...

880
01:12:48,875 --> 01:12:49,916
eight...

881
01:12:51,166 --> 01:12:52,000
ten,

882
01:12:52,666 --> 01:12:54,416
fourteen, eighteen...

883
01:12:55,750 --> 01:12:56,708
twenty...

884
01:12:59,000 --> 01:12:59,958
twenty--

885
01:13:06,458 --> 01:13:07,416
Twenty-two.

886
01:13:10,708 --> 01:13:11,625
Twenty-two.

887
01:13:12,833 --> 01:13:13,750
Yeah.

888
01:13:15,041 --> 01:13:16,166
[muttering]

889
01:13:16,541 --> 01:13:17,625
Twenty-three.

890
01:13:17,916 --> 01:13:21,375
By my arithmetic, you're $10,000 shy.

891
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:27,250
[sighs]

892
01:13:29,625 --> 01:13:31,541
[rustling in pockets]

893
01:13:31,666 --> 01:13:32,958
[mutters]

894
01:13:33,125 --> 01:13:35,375
[panting]

895
01:13:51,291 --> 01:13:52,333
Eighty-two hundred.

896
01:13:54,833 --> 01:13:56,000
Eighty-two hundred.

897
01:14:00,791 --> 01:14:02,000
May I borrow this?

898
01:14:09,250 --> 01:14:10,791
[Jesse] What are you doing?

899
01:14:11,291 --> 01:14:14,000
[man] I'm gathering your belongings.

900
01:14:14,083 --> 01:14:15,791
[Jesse] No, no no. No, no. Stop.

901
01:14:15,875 --> 01:14:18,166
I'm not gonna try to collect
what you owe me.

902
01:14:19,083 --> 01:14:21,208
I don't think it would end well
for either one of us. 

903
01:14:21,666 --> 01:14:23,958
This is not an inconsequential
amount of money.

904
01:14:24,041 --> 01:14:25,041
Hey, listen to me.

905
01:14:25,125 --> 01:14:27,791
Spend it wisely,
it will last you for years.

906
01:14:27,875 --> 01:14:29,625
Please, you don't understand.

907
01:14:29,708 --> 01:14:32,583
Keep a low profile, travel by night.

908
01:14:32,666 --> 01:14:33,875
[under breath] Oh, God.

909
01:14:34,625 --> 01:14:36,000
With a little luck, 

910
01:14:36,625 --> 01:14:40,166
you will soon find yourself
many miles from here.

911
01:14:41,833 --> 01:14:43,250
Godspeed to you.

912
01:14:46,291 --> 01:14:47,125
So that's it?

913
01:14:47,208 --> 01:14:48,208
That's it. 

914
01:14:49,333 --> 01:14:50,458
Now, please leave.

915
01:14:51,333 --> 01:14:53,750
You are going to jack me up

916
01:14:54,291 --> 01:14:56,875
over a measly $1,800?

917
01:14:59,125 --> 01:15:00,500
I've got to reopen. 

918
01:15:01,500 --> 01:15:03,208
The longer you stick around here,

919
01:15:03,291 --> 01:15:05,208
the more you jeopardize yourself.

920
01:15:05,291 --> 01:15:06,708
[Jesse] No, hey...

921
01:15:08,291 --> 01:15:09,500
[lock clicks, door dings]

922
01:15:09,583 --> 01:15:10,791
No. Hey...

923
01:15:12,583 --> 01:15:14,208
Have you been watching the news?

924
01:15:14,291 --> 01:15:16,000
I have. Very much so.

925
01:15:16,125 --> 01:15:18,166
So you hear
what they've been saying about me.

926
01:15:19,875 --> 01:15:21,333
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

927
01:15:21,416 --> 01:15:23,625
Look, these people,

928
01:15:24,500 --> 01:15:27,500
they have kept me in a concrete hole.

929
01:15:28,500 --> 01:15:30,291
Look, I don't even know what month it is. 

930
01:15:31,083 --> 01:15:35,000
They made me watch when they...
when they shot someone--

931
01:15:35,083 --> 01:15:38,041
If you believe that you can
pull on people's heartstrings,

932
01:15:38,125 --> 01:15:40,333
you should take your chances
with the police.

933
01:15:41,250 --> 01:15:43,541
From where I sit, you made your own luck. 

934
01:15:44,333 --> 01:15:46,083
As did your former partner.

935
01:15:46,583 --> 01:15:47,916
As did your lawyer.

936
01:15:49,375 --> 01:15:51,833
You said it yourself, a deal's a deal.

937
01:15:53,791 --> 01:15:54,666
No.

938
01:15:56,875 --> 01:15:58,041
[clicks lock]

939
01:15:58,166 --> 01:16:00,625
I am not going anywhere.

940
01:16:02,083 --> 01:16:04,083
I am staying right here 

941
01:16:04,666 --> 01:16:06,333
until you help me.

942
01:16:07,916 --> 01:16:10,875
[panting]

943
01:16:15,750 --> 01:16:17,083
[buttons beeping]

944
01:16:17,250 --> 01:16:18,500
[Jesse] What are you doing?

945
01:16:22,500 --> 01:16:23,541
Hi, yes.

946
01:16:23,916 --> 01:16:26,375
There's a young man in my store,

947
01:16:26,708 --> 01:16:28,000
and he refuses to leave.

948
01:16:28,083 --> 01:16:29,541
[whispering] Hey, stop.

949
01:16:29,625 --> 01:16:30,583
I...

950
01:16:31,375 --> 01:16:33,750
-Yeah, he might be armed.
-Stop it.

951
01:16:34,541 --> 01:16:35,916
Uh, not overtly.

952
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:38,541
But, yes,
I'm beginning to feel threatened.

953
01:16:38,625 --> 01:16:40,625
-[Jesse] Are you serious?
-Sure.

954
01:16:40,708 --> 01:16:42,541
My name is Ed Galbraith.

955
01:16:42,625 --> 01:16:45,250
I own Best Quality Vacuum,

956
01:16:45,333 --> 01:16:48,458
2714, 4th Street. 

957
01:16:49,208 --> 01:16:50,625
Northwest. That's correct.

958
01:16:51,375 --> 01:16:55,125
I would appreciate it very much
if you'd send someone immediately.

959
01:16:58,083 --> 01:16:58,916
[beeps]

960
01:17:02,250 --> 01:17:03,416
[Ed sighs]

961
01:17:12,583 --> 01:17:15,625
You are so full of crap. 

962
01:17:16,583 --> 01:17:18,041
You didn't call anybody just now.

963
01:17:18,625 --> 01:17:19,500
You faked it. 

964
01:17:19,791 --> 01:17:21,375
And you wanna know how I know? 

965
01:17:22,125 --> 01:17:24,458
You got as much to lose as I do.

966
01:17:25,250 --> 01:17:27,083
More. Way more.

967
01:17:27,166 --> 01:17:30,708
When your "cops" get here
and they bust me, 

968
01:17:31,250 --> 01:17:34,416
first question they're gonna ask 
is what am I doing here,

969
01:17:34,500 --> 01:17:36,875
trying to hand over
a Hefty bag full of cash

970
01:17:36,958 --> 01:17:40,166
to a dude who runs
a vacuum cleaner store.

971
01:17:40,583 --> 01:17:42,791
What comes out then? Huh?

972
01:17:43,625 --> 01:17:44,625
[chuckles]

973
01:17:44,708 --> 01:17:47,208
Oh, and you, uh, wanna know 
what else is bullshit?

974
01:17:47,291 --> 01:17:49,291
You know, like, word to the wise:

975
01:17:49,375 --> 01:17:52,416
next time to try to pull this shit
on someone, 

976
01:17:53,125 --> 01:17:56,416
you don't just hang up on a 9-1-1 call.

977
01:17:57,208 --> 01:17:58,333
They won't let you.

978
01:17:58,416 --> 01:18:03,208
Because the lady, or dude, or whoever
is like, "Stay on the line with me, sir.

979
01:18:03,291 --> 01:18:06,500
Stay on the line
until the officers arrive."

980
01:18:06,958 --> 01:18:10,500
And if you did hang up,
they'd call you back immediately. 

981
01:18:10,666 --> 01:18:12,791
But, hey, guess what? 

982
01:18:12,875 --> 01:18:15,791
Seriously, yo. Pathetic.

983
01:18:18,125 --> 01:18:20,791
Wow, you gotta love that response time.

984
01:18:23,875 --> 01:18:24,791
[Ed] Take your money.

985
01:18:33,458 --> 01:18:35,583
[door opens and closes at distance]

986
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:41,916
Officers, thank you very much
for getting here so fast.

987
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,375
-He obviously heard my call and--
-Is he still here?

988
01:18:44,458 --> 01:18:46,833
No, he's not, he's gone. I, uh...

989
01:18:47,125 --> 01:18:49,916
Uh, he was spooked by my phone call 

990
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:52,333
and he headed up northbound, uh...

991
01:18:53,458 --> 01:18:55,458
on foot maybe 30 seconds ago.

992
01:18:55,541 --> 01:18:57,583
-Can you describe him?
-Uh, sure I can.

993
01:18:57,666 --> 01:18:58,625
He was, uh...

994
01:18:59,333 --> 01:19:01,291
young, uh, he's white, 

995
01:19:01,375 --> 01:19:03,250
skinny, very tall guy.

996
01:19:03,333 --> 01:19:04,916
Six-five, six-six.<i> </i>

997
01:19:05,083 --> 01:19:07,333
Had a tattoo over his right eyebrow. 

998
01:19:07,416 --> 01:19:12,000
-Interesting. A large insect.

01:19:35,666 --> 01:19:37,958
Best Quality Vacuum, how may I help you?

[Jesse]
<i>A deal's a deal? Your word is your bond?</i>

1003
01:19:45,208 --> 01:19:46,208
It is.

1004
01:19:47,708 --> 01:19:49,250
I'll get you your money.

1006
01:20:23,333 --> 01:20:24,291
Hello?

[Jesse]<i> Hey, Mom.</i>

1008
01:20:27,875 --> 01:20:28,791
Jesse?

1009
01:20:29,375 --> 01:20:30,541
It's Jesse.

1010
01:20:32,166 --> 01:20:33,625
Give me-- Give me the phone.

1011
01:20:34,708 --> 01:20:36,166
Jesse, is that you?

1012
01:20:36,916 --> 01:20:38,625
[Jesse] <i>Hey, Dad. Yeah, it's me.</i>

1013
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:41,333
<i>How the both of you doing?</i>

1014
01:20:42,125 --> 01:20:43,166
We've been better.

1015
01:20:43,833 --> 01:20:44,708
Yeah.

1016
01:20:45,833 --> 01:20:48,291
How's Jake? Can I say hi to him?

1017
01:20:48,875 --> 01:20:50,875
[Adam]<i> Jake's on a band trip to London,</i>

[both] <i>Jesse, where are you?</i>

1019
01:20:53,666 --> 01:20:56,458
I heard you saying
that I should turn myself in.

1020
01:20:56,541 --> 01:20:59,250
[Diane] Yes. It's the right thing to do.

1021
01:20:59,625 --> 01:21:01,666
[voice breaking]
Quit running and get some help.

1022
01:21:01,750 --> 01:21:03,541
[Adam] No one is trying to hurt you, son.<i> </i>

1023
01:21:03,625 --> 01:21:07,750
Better you come forward on your own,
it'll be safer for you, better all around.

[Jesse] <i>You remember where</i>

1034

I'm Catholic and it's Friday?

1119
01:30:08,375 --> 01:30:12,708
You sure you couldn't just
put a few more gussets up there, Neil?

1120
01:30:13,083 --> 01:30:14,708
I mean, what could it hurt, right?

Yeah, I don't see jack shit flexing.

You could hang an F150 from it

1138

like a beach ball.

Okay, you and your big four inches.
It's just this little bastard's wiry.

1141

Have him knock himself out.

Wanna put your money
where your mouth is?

What'd you call 'em, gussets?

No charge.

01:36:08,500 --> 01:36:11,500
That three-way split
didn't quite cover it for me.

1229
01:36:12,333 --> 01:36:14,666
I'd appreciate you helping me out.

1230
01:36:15,041 --> 01:36:17,666
Well, what's he talking about?
Three-way split?

1231
01:36:17,750 --> 01:36:20,000
You mean there was a third more? 

1232
01:36:20,083 --> 01:36:21,250
And you gave it to him?

1233
01:36:22,291 --> 01:36:23,958
It's a long story.

1234
01:36:24,833 --> 01:36:25,916
Well... [scoffs]

1235
01:36:26,041 --> 01:36:27,250
What long story?

1236
01:36:27,333 --> 01:36:29,833
When I left,
he didn't even have a fucking gun.

1237
01:36:29,916 --> 01:36:31,625
Well, he's got one now, doesn't he?

1238
01:36:32,208 --> 01:36:34,750
So, you know, shut up. Let me handle this.

1239
01:36:34,958 --> 01:36:36,541
Neil, who the hell is this guy?

1240
01:36:36,625 --> 01:36:38,958
Yeah, I can't believe you just
let him walk in here with--

1241
01:36:39,041 --> 01:36:40,958
"Shut up" means everybody.

1242
01:36:45,333 --> 01:36:46,250
Now,

1243
01:36:46,791 --> 01:36:49,750
how exactly do you plan
on pulling this off?

1244
01:36:50,666 --> 01:36:53,375
I mean, being that there's five of us
and one of you.

1245
01:36:55,541 --> 01:36:57,291
I'm not here to rob you.

1246
01:36:57,791 --> 01:36:59,041
[Neil] Oh, you're not?

1247
01:37:00,458 --> 01:37:01,666
Then how's this work?

1248
01:37:04,375 --> 01:37:05,833
All I need is $1,800. 

1249
01:37:06,875 --> 01:37:08,208
I'm asking as a...

1250
01:37:08,875 --> 01:37:09,708
a favor.

1251
01:37:10,083 --> 01:37:11,583
Oh, what, like charity?

1252
01:37:11,666 --> 01:37:15,291
Seems to me this silly son of a bitch
already forked over, big time.

1253
01:37:15,375 --> 01:37:17,250
Casey, seriously, shut up. 

1254
01:37:18,625 --> 01:37:20,250
$1,800, huh?

1255
01:37:21,458 --> 01:37:23,166
Why not an even two grand?

1256
01:37:23,250 --> 01:37:24,875
You know, nice round number.

1257
01:37:24,958 --> 01:37:26,375
$1,800 is all I need.

1258
01:37:27,500 --> 01:37:30,166
So, what's the gun for?
It's like personal protection?

1259
01:37:31,458 --> 01:37:33,458
I mean, is that a...

1260
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:37,541
What is that? Let me see that thing.
Show me.

1261
01:37:39,916 --> 01:37:43,000
Oh, my God, is that a .22? 

1262
01:37:43,833 --> 01:37:45,583
You brought a .22?

1263
01:37:45,875 --> 01:37:46,875
Jesus!

1264
01:37:46,958 --> 01:37:49,041
-[laughing]
-[Neil] Where'd you get that thing?

1265
01:37:49,125 --> 01:37:50,875
I think it was my grandfather's.

1266
01:37:50,958 --> 01:37:52,625
[Neil] Oh, well, it's adorable.

1267
01:37:52,708 --> 01:37:54,708
I know we got empty beer cans around here

1268
01:37:54,916 --> 01:37:56,291
if you wanna do some plinking?

1269
01:37:56,375 --> 01:37:59,833
[laughing]

1270
01:38:00,500 --> 01:38:01,583
Eighteen hundred.

1271
01:38:02,208 --> 01:38:03,458
I'm gone forever. 

1272
01:38:04,166 --> 01:38:05,333
Simple as that.

1273
01:38:05,583 --> 01:38:09,500
Neil, I swear to God, if you give
this piece of shit one more dollar--

1274
01:38:35,708 --> 01:38:36,916
Cold out here.

1275
01:38:40,958 --> 01:38:41,958
Tell you what. 

1276
01:38:44,333 --> 01:38:48,125
My third is in a duffel bag
in the top drawer of that file cabinet.

1277
01:38:50,583 --> 01:38:51,750
Where's yours?

1278
01:38:54,583 --> 01:38:55,625
In my car. 

1279
01:38:56,416 --> 01:38:57,625
Parked up the street.

1280
01:38:58,041 --> 01:38:59,083
What do you say...

1281
01:39:02,125 --> 01:39:03,291
your .22...

1282
01:39:03,958 --> 01:39:05,458
against my .45? 

1283
01:39:07,250 --> 01:39:08,416
Winner takes all.

1284
01:39:08,916 --> 01:39:11,583
-Like the Wild West?
-[Neil] Yeah.

1285
01:39:12,375 --> 01:39:13,833
Like the Wild West.

1286
01:39:14,666 --> 01:39:16,833
[chuckling] What? Come on.

1287
01:39:22,958 --> 01:39:24,375
Jesus! Neil?

1288
01:39:24,875 --> 01:39:27,250
-Come on, man, I didn't mean this--
-Casey.

1289
01:39:27,833 --> 01:39:30,333
Shut the fuck up.

1290
01:39:32,083 --> 01:39:35,041
-[man 1] I'm not gonna get in another--
-[man 2] No, wait, you go-- Oh!

1291
01:39:36,041 --> 01:39:36,916
Shoot!

1292
01:39:41,583 --> 01:39:42,625
You ready?

1293
01:39:45,583 --> 01:39:46,541
Yeah.

1294
01:40:21,375 --> 01:40:23,125
[gunshots]

1295
01:40:26,791 --> 01:40:27,791
[thuds]

1296
01:40:32,416 --> 01:40:33,500
[gunshots]

1297
01:40:37,666 --> 01:40:39,083
[glass shatters]

1298
01:40:50,791 --> 01:40:52,791
[panting]

1299
01:40:54,333 --> 01:40:55,208
Hey, don't shoot.

1300
01:40:55,791 --> 01:40:57,041
All right. Get over here.

1301
01:40:57,541 --> 01:40:59,541
-Please.
-All right, get up!

1302
01:41:00,625 --> 01:41:01,541
[sighs]

1303
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:04,833
All right.

1304
01:41:05,666 --> 01:41:06,791
Give me your license.

1305
01:41:06,875 --> 01:41:08,166
[glass shatters]

1306
01:41:08,416 --> 01:41:10,583
-[shouting] Driver's license, do it!
-[man 1] Yes.

1307
01:41:17,041 --> 01:41:18,250
I got kids.

1308
01:41:18,500 --> 01:41:19,958
Like I give a shit. 

1309
01:41:21,208 --> 01:41:22,083
All right.

1310
01:41:22,708 --> 01:41:23,875
Sean,

1311
01:41:24,333 --> 01:41:25,291
Kyle,

1312
01:41:26,333 --> 01:41:27,291
Colin.

1313
01:41:27,833 --> 01:41:29,208
I know where you live.

1314
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:31,625
You tell the cops about me,

1315
01:41:31,958 --> 01:41:35,416
and I am coming
for every goddamn one of you.

1316
01:41:36,541 --> 01:41:38,291
-You understand?
-[all] Yeah.

1317
01:41:42,208 --> 01:41:43,041
Go.

1318
01:41:43,916 --> 01:41:44,916
Go!

1319
01:41:51,416 --> 01:41:52,708
Dude, you're on fire.

1320
01:42:05,750 --> 01:42:06,666
[glass shatters]

1321
01:42:41,666 --> 01:42:44,666
[hissing]

1322
01:43:02,125 --> 01:43:04,458
[debris clattering]

1323
01:43:04,791 --> 01:43:06,541
[engine starts]

1324
01:43:16,708 --> 01:43:17,833
[water splashes]

1325
01:43:20,291 --> 01:43:22,291
[sighing]

1326
01:43:23,291 --> 01:43:24,666
Ah.

1327
01:43:27,375 --> 01:43:29,375
[exhales]

1328
01:43:41,500 --> 01:43:42,916
[Jesse] <i>Of course I miss you.</i> 

1329
01:43:46,125 --> 01:43:48,500
Yeah? Well...

1330
01:43:49,250 --> 01:43:50,750
do you miss me?

1331
01:43:55,375 --> 01:43:56,208
I don't know.

1332
01:43:57,791 --> 01:44:00,250
How you--
How are you gonna convince me? 

1333
01:44:13,791 --> 01:44:15,791
[lock clicks, door opens]

1334
01:44:51,083 --> 01:44:53,083
[indistinct chatter]

1335
01:45:02,041 --> 01:45:03,583
Yeah, bitch.

1336
01:45:04,541 --> 01:45:06,875
[coughing]

1337
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:18,666
-Ah.
-Thank you.

1338
01:45:19,416 --> 01:45:20,750
Leave the pitcher, would ya?

1339
01:45:21,166 --> 01:45:23,375
-Sorry, can't really do that.
-W-- wait.

1340
01:45:28,083 --> 01:45:28,916
Sure you can.

1341
01:45:34,833 --> 01:45:35,916
Wow.

1342
01:45:36,333 --> 01:45:39,166
-It's like I'm here with Sinatra.
-I know, right?

1343
01:45:39,750 --> 01:45:40,583
[chuckles]

1344
01:45:42,041 --> 01:45:44,083
Certainly went big with the pineapple.

1345
01:45:44,416 --> 01:45:46,458
[Jesse]
Only an asshole doesn't like pineapple.

1346
01:45:47,250 --> 01:45:48,375
Guessing you don't?

1347
01:45:49,041 --> 01:45:50,583
[Walter] I can take it or leave it.

1348
01:45:51,416 --> 01:45:53,875
Pineapple's good for you.
It's got bromide.

1349
01:45:53,958 --> 01:45:55,041
Bromelain.

1350
01:45:55,625 --> 01:45:56,833
But, close. 

1351
01:45:58,208 --> 01:46:00,041
Actually, it's not close at all.

1352
01:46:00,208 --> 01:46:02,291
Are you gonna eat?
You should really eat something.

1353
01:46:02,375 --> 01:46:03,875
No, I'm eating. I'll eat.

1354
01:46:03,958 --> 01:46:05,458
Gotta eat, gotta hydrate.

1355
01:46:05,541 --> 01:46:07,541
Get those electrolytes
you were talking about. 

1356
01:46:07,625 --> 01:46:09,833
-Your sodium, you know, all that shit.
-Good, yeah.

1357
01:46:11,750 --> 01:46:12,750
Yeah.

1358
01:46:12,916 --> 01:46:14,916
[coughing]

1359
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:19,833
[Jesse] Hey.

1360
01:46:20,750 --> 01:46:23,041
-He's all right.
-[Walter] I'm fine, thank you.

1361
01:46:23,541 --> 01:46:24,958
-You all right?
-I'm fine. Good.

1362
01:46:25,041 --> 01:46:26,166
-Sit down.
-All right.

1363
01:46:42,541 --> 01:46:44,625
How long will it take to sell this batch?

1364
01:46:47,833 --> 01:46:49,250
-Six months.
-[Walter] Jeez...

1365
01:46:49,333 --> 01:46:50,458
Easy. Maybe more.

1366
01:46:51,000 --> 01:46:53,541
There's no one that you can think of
who might...

1367
01:46:53,958 --> 01:46:55,125
buy the entire amount?

1368
01:46:55,208 --> 01:46:58,666
Uh, someone with a spare $1.3 million
lying around? No.

1369
01:46:59,208 --> 01:47:00,500
Can't say that I do.

1370
01:47:06,041 --> 01:47:10,291
Your family is gonna get every dime
they got coming to them, Mr. White.

1371
01:47:11,291 --> 01:47:12,916
No matter how long it takes.

1372
01:47:19,583 --> 01:47:21,916
-Hydrate. Seriously.
-Yeah.

1373
01:47:30,875 --> 01:47:32,916
[Walter] What about you, Jesse? Hm?

1374
01:47:33,708 --> 01:47:36,208
-[Jesse] Huh?
-After this. What then?

1375
01:47:37,333 --> 01:47:38,458
[Jesse grunts]

1376
01:47:39,291 --> 01:47:41,333
Nothing? What about college?

1377
01:47:41,750 --> 01:47:42,833
[laughs]

1378
01:47:42,958 --> 01:47:46,458
No, what is stopping you
from going to college?

1379
01:47:47,000 --> 01:47:47,958
Um...

1380
01:47:49,250 --> 01:47:51,500
-Nothing, I guess.
-Yeah, nothing at all.

1381
01:47:52,250 --> 01:47:54,958
-Say you went to college.
-[Jesse] Uh-huh...

1382
01:47:55,250 --> 01:47:57,666
What would you study, you think, eh?

1383
01:47:58,208 --> 01:47:59,166
What interests you?

1384
01:48:02,250 --> 01:48:03,416
Sports Medicine?

1385
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:06,166
Sports Medicine.

1386
01:48:06,583 --> 01:48:07,416
Yeah.

1387
01:48:08,666 --> 01:48:11,000
That's-- Yeah, sure. That's...

1388
01:48:11,583 --> 01:48:12,875
-[Jesse] Yeah.
-...could...

1389
01:48:13,625 --> 01:48:16,416
Or... Business. Hm?

1390
01:48:16,625 --> 01:48:18,083
Business and Marketing.

1391
01:48:19,083 --> 01:48:21,666
You could practically teach that class.

1392
01:48:21,916 --> 01:48:24,375
-Well, yeah.
-I mean, you'd be a natural.

1393
01:48:25,708 --> 01:48:29,375
And with a Business degree,
I mean, that's handy anywhere.

1394
01:48:30,791 --> 01:48:31,750
[Jesse] Yeah.

1395
01:48:32,125 --> 01:48:34,625
-Yeah, I guess that could be cool.
-[Walter] Yeah.

1396
01:48:34,708 --> 01:48:36,000
You could do it too.

1397
01:48:37,500 --> 01:48:38,541
First step,

1398
01:48:39,500 --> 01:48:41,750
get your GED, that's no problem.

1399
01:48:42,708 --> 01:48:44,291
What do I need a GED for? 

1400
01:48:44,625 --> 01:48:45,750
I got my diploma.

1401
01:48:47,791 --> 01:48:48,875
Oh.

1402
01:48:49,583 --> 01:48:51,875
Of course, yeah, right. 
Right, right, right.

1403
01:48:51,958 --> 01:48:54,750
Yo, you were standing right on stage
when they handed it to me.

1404
01:48:54,833 --> 01:48:56,500
I know, it just slipped my mind.

1405
01:48:56,583 --> 01:48:59,500
I totally graduated high school, dick. 

1406
01:48:59,583 --> 01:49:02,208
-Which is no thanks to you, all right?
-Just stay on the subject here.

1407
01:49:02,291 --> 01:49:03,166
All right?

1408
01:49:03,375 --> 01:49:05,583
The larger point being...

1409
01:49:08,583 --> 01:49:11,625
You know, look, forget it.
I-- I don't have a larger point.

1410
01:49:11,708 --> 01:49:14,125
-I'm just making conversation.
-[Jesse] Yeah.

1411
01:49:18,333 --> 01:49:19,333
Hm.

1412
01:49:22,458 --> 01:49:24,375
You're really lucky, you know that? 

1413
01:49:29,083 --> 01:49:32,291
You didn't have to wait your whole life
to do something special.

This is Alaska.

1420

This is Alaska. 

1421
01:51:34,750 --> 01:51:38,041
Forty miles in that direction
gets you to Haines.

1422
01:51:41,458 --> 01:51:42,625
It's quiet.

1423
01:51:44,166 --> 01:51:45,083
[Ed] Yeah.

1424
01:51:45,500 --> 01:51:47,333
Figured you could use some of that.

1425
01:51:54,166 --> 01:51:55,166
All right.

1426
01:51:55,833 --> 01:51:56,833
Date of birth?

1427
01:51:58,208 --> 01:51:59,625
[Jesse] 06/10/84.

1428
01:52:00,125 --> 01:52:01,833
-Mother's maiden name.
-Stackhouse.

1429
01:52:02,375 --> 01:52:03,500
Where was she born?

1430
01:52:03,916 --> 01:52:06,500
Kadena Air Force Base, Okinawa, Japan.

1431
01:52:06,833 --> 01:52:08,000
Father's date of birth.

02/07/51.

1433
01:52:10,375 --> 01:52:12,916
Your father's second to the last job.

1434
01:52:14,375 --> 01:52:17,958
Claims adjuster, Dairyland Insurance,
Appleton, Wisconsin.

1435
01:52:18,041 --> 01:52:19,833
What's your social security number?

1436
01:52:19,916 --> 01:52:22,958
[Jesse] 141-18-6941.

1437
01:52:23,208 --> 01:52:24,083
Backward.

1438
01:52:27,041 --> 01:52:31,791
1496-81-141.

1439
01:52:33,250 --> 01:52:34,166
[Ed] All right.

1440
01:52:35,083 --> 01:52:37,500
Daylight's burning,
you know where you're going. 

1441
01:52:37,625 --> 01:52:38,708
Anything else?

1442
01:52:44,583 --> 01:52:45,875
Hold on a sec.

1443
01:53:18,458 --> 01:53:19,791
[sighs]

1444
01:53:34,583 --> 01:53:35,875
Seal this up, please.

1445
01:53:41,541 --> 01:53:43,666
I'm going to Mexico City in about a month.

1446
01:53:43,750 --> 01:53:45,750
I'll mail it from there.

1447
01:53:46,833 --> 01:53:49,125
Anyone else you wanna say goodbye to?

1448
01:53:51,708 --> 01:53:54,458
Not many of us
get a chance to start fresh.

1449
01:53:55,916 --> 01:53:57,916
Good luck, Mr. Driscoll.

1451
01:54:50,833 --> 01:54:55,041
[Jesse] <i>I was thinking about that thing </i>
<i>you said about the universe.</i>

1452
01:54:56,875 --> 01:54:58,875
Going where the universe takes you?

1453
01:54:59,833 --> 01:55:00,875
Right on.

1454
01:55:01,875 --> 01:55:03,666
I think it's a cool philosophy.

1455
01:55:05,291 --> 01:55:08,000
I was being metaphorical.
It's a terrible philosophy.

1456
01:55:12,916 --> 01:55:15,541
I've gone where the universe takes me
my whole life.

1457
01:55:18,208 --> 01:55:20,625
It's better to make those decisions
for yourself.
