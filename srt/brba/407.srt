00:16:09,427 --> 00:16:11,679

Next stop: Washington, D.C.

965
00:40:57,872 --> 00:41:00,833
Sitting behind a desk,

966
00:41:00,833 --> 00:41:03,128
papers piled so high

967
00:41:00,833 --> 00:41:03,128
you can't see over them.

968
00:41:03,128 --> 00:41:05,546
Hey, better you than me,

969
00:41:03,128 --> 00:41:05,546
buddy.

970
00:41:05,546 --> 00:41:07,840
Seriously, congratulations,

971
00:41:05,546 --> 00:41:07,840
buddy.

972
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,301
Thanks.

973
00:41:09,301 --> 00:41:11,886
Steve said you might

974
00:41:09,301 --> 00:41:11,886
have something for us.

975
00:41:11,886 --> 00:41:14,931
Yeah, maybe. You guys are gonna

976
00:41:11,886 --> 00:41:14,931
have to tell me.

977
00:41:15,974 --> 00:41:18,310
You remember my pal

978
00:41:15,974 --> 00:41:18,310
Tim Roberts?

979
00:41:18,310 --> 00:41:19,685
APD detective?

980
00:41:19,685 --> 00:41:22,147
Yeah, well, he's working

981
00:41:19,685 --> 00:41:22,147
on a murder case.

982
00:41:22,147 --> 00:41:24,816
The victim's a 34-year-old

983
00:41:22,147 --> 00:41:24,816
male Caucasian

984
00:41:24,816 --> 00:41:27,026
by the name

985
00:41:24,816 --> 00:41:27,026
of Gale Boetticher.

986
00:41:27,026 --> 00:41:29,446
One night last month,

987
00:41:27,026 --> 00:41:29,446
Boetticher opens the door

988
00:41:29,446 --> 00:41:31,239
and, bam,

989
00:41:31,239 --> 00:41:35,160
takes a bullet to the face from

990
00:41:31,239 --> 00:41:35,160
a person or persons unknown.

991
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:39,205
Now, this Gale Boetticher

992
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:39,205
is a bona fide chemistry genius.

993
00:41:39,205 --> 00:41:42,459
I mean, he's got degrees

994
00:41:39,205 --> 00:41:42,459
up the wazoo, right?

995
00:41:42,459 --> 00:41:46,921
And, well, as you might expect,

996
00:41:42,459 --> 00:41:46,921
he's a nerd's nerd.

997
00:41:46,921 --> 00:41:49,966
Vegan, sandals and socks

998
00:41:46,921 --> 00:41:49,966
kind of guy.

999
00:41:49,966 --> 00:41:55,347
As it turns out, he's also

1000
00:41:49,966 --> 00:41:55,347
an A-number-one meth cook.

1001
00:41:55,347 --> 00:42:00,685
And what caught my eye is

1002
00:41:55,347 --> 00:42:00,685
his specialty product's blue.

1003
00:42:00,685 --> 00:42:02,979
So, what are you thinking?

1004
00:42:02,979 --> 00:42:04,439
This is your Heisenberg?

1005
00:42:04,439 --> 00:42:08,109
No. What I think

1006
00:42:04,439 --> 00:42:08,109
we got here is, ahem,

1007
00:42:08,109 --> 00:42:10,362
Heisenberg's former cook,

1008
00:42:10,362 --> 00:42:14,282
and maybe a line

1009
00:42:10,362 --> 00:42:14,282
on Heisenberg himself.

1010
00:42:15,741 --> 00:42:17,035
Anyway, lo and behold,

1011
00:42:17,035 --> 00:42:21,080
amidst all the hippie-dippy

1012
00:42:17,035 --> 00:42:21,080
nonsense,

1013
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:22,915
I find this.

1014
00:42:22,915 --> 00:42:27,003
Now, this here,

1015
00:42:22,915 --> 00:42:27,003
I do a little Google-fu,

1016
00:42:27,003 --> 00:42:29,839
and I realize

1017
00:42:27,003 --> 00:42:29,839
it's a parts number

1018
00:42:29,839 --> 00:42:33,468
specifically for this baby.

1019
00:42:33,468 --> 00:42:35,011
Now that there

1020
00:42:33,468 --> 00:42:35,011
is a high-volume

1021
00:42:35,011 --> 00:42:39,598
HEPA industrial

1022
00:42:35,011 --> 00:42:39,598
air filtration system.

1023
00:42:39,598 --> 00:42:41,476
That's a $300,000 gadget.

1024
00:42:41,476 --> 00:42:45,897
Perfect for a pharmaceutical

1025
00:42:41,476 --> 00:42:45,897
plant or microchip factory,

1026
00:42:45,897 --> 00:42:50,818
or maybe the biggest meth lab

1027
00:42:45,897 --> 00:42:50,818
north of the border.

1028
00:42:52,862 --> 00:42:54,822
Okay.

1029
00:42:54,822 --> 00:42:57,492
So this little dingus here

1030
00:42:54,822 --> 00:42:57,492
is manufactured

1031
00:42:57,492 --> 00:43:02,705
by a big international concern:

1032
00:42:57,492 --> 00:43:02,705
Madrigal Electromotive.

1033
00:43:02,705 --> 00:43:05,542
I call their Houston office,

1034
00:43:02,705 --> 00:43:05,542
and eventually I get through

1035
00:43:05,542 --> 00:43:07,585
to the nicest little

1036
00:43:05,542 --> 00:43:07,585
20-year-old temp.

1037
00:43:07,585 --> 00:43:09,795
I use some of the Schrader

1038
00:43:07,585 --> 00:43:09,795
sweet-talk on her,

1039
00:43:09,795 --> 00:43:11,381
before you know it,

1040
00:43:09,795 --> 00:43:11,381
she's pulling files.

1041
00:43:11,381 --> 00:43:13,174
Turns out

1042
00:43:11,381 --> 00:43:13,174
six months ago,

1043
00:43:13,174 --> 00:43:17,429
one of these systems was shipped

1044
00:43:13,174 --> 00:43:17,429
to a depot right here in ABQ.

1045
00:43:17,429 --> 00:43:19,722
Who signed for it?

1046
00:43:19,722 --> 00:43:21,182
Gale Boetticher.

1047
00:43:21,182 --> 00:43:24,227
So I asked my new girlfriend,

1048
00:43:21,182 --> 00:43:24,227
"Who paid for it?"

1049
00:43:24,227 --> 00:43:26,854
And she says, "Nobody."

1050

[SCOFFS]

1051
00:43:28,647 --> 00:43:32,360
They have no record that anybody

1052
00:43:28,647 --> 00:43:32,360
actually paid for this thing.

1053
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:35,947
So I go back and push more

1054
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:35,947
and before you know it,

1055
00:43:35,947 --> 00:43:38,450
the temp's gone,

1056
00:43:35,947 --> 00:43:38,450
there's no forwarding address.

1057
00:43:38,450 --> 00:43:40,535
and I'm talking to some

1058
00:43:38,450 --> 00:43:40,535
snot-nose lawyer

1059
00:43:40,535 --> 00:43:42,495
who's asking me

1060
00:43:40,535 --> 00:43:42,495
for my badge number.

1061
00:43:42,495 --> 00:43:45,164
Brick wall.

1062
00:43:45,164 --> 00:43:49,461
So I take a peek

1063
00:43:45,164 --> 00:43:49,461
into Madrigal Electromotive.

1064
00:43:49,461 --> 00:43:52,171
Now, Madrigal is based

1065
00:43:49,461 --> 00:43:52,171
in Hanover, Germany,

1066
00:43:52,171 --> 00:43:55,091
but they're what they call

1067
00:43:52,171 --> 00:43:55,091
"highly diversified."

1068
00:43:55,091 --> 00:43:57,718
Industrial equipment,

1069
00:43:55,091 --> 00:43:57,718
global shipping,

1070
00:43:57,718 --> 00:43:59,262
major construction,

1071
00:43:59,262 --> 00:44:03,516
and a tiny little foothold

1072
00:43:59,262 --> 00:44:03,516
in American fast food,

1073
00:44:03,516 --> 00:44:06,478
specifically

1074
00:44:03,516 --> 00:44:06,478
a local chain.

1075
00:44:06,478 --> 00:44:08,438
Pollos Hermanos.

1076
00:44:11,357 --> 00:44:13,985
Okay. So what, right?

1077
00:44:11,357 --> 00:44:13,985
Boetticher's dead.

1078
00:44:13,985 --> 00:44:17,238
I got no line on who's

1079
00:44:13,985 --> 00:44:17,238
been bankrolling him

1080
00:44:17,238 --> 00:44:19,198
or where his lab was.

1081
00:44:19,198 --> 00:44:21,784
The whole thing's

1082
00:44:19,198 --> 00:44:21,784
a snipe hunt, right?

1083
00:44:21,784 --> 00:44:26,372
But now I get this crazy idea,

1084
00:44:26,372 --> 00:44:28,749
and I can't shake it.

1085
00:44:28,749 --> 00:44:32,003
I mean, I-- I stay up nights

1086
00:44:28,749 --> 00:44:32,003
staring at the ceiling

1087
00:44:32,003 --> 00:44:33,671
trying to make sense of it.

1088
00:44:33,671 --> 00:44:36,382
That napkin. Remember, I told

1089
00:44:33,671 --> 00:44:36,382
you Boetticher's a vegan.

1090
00:44:36,382 --> 00:44:38,551
I mean, we're talking

1093
00:44:38,551 --> 00:44:42,680
or whatever the hell that is.

1094
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:47,977
What's a vegan doing

1095
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:47,977
in a fried chicken joint?

1096
00:44:50,938 --> 00:44:53,024
Maybe he's meeting somebody.

1097
00:44:53,024 --> 00:44:55,401
Like who?

1098
00:44:55,401 --> 00:44:57,778
Well, like, maybe...

"keep your friends close

1106

but your enemies closer."

1107

1109
00:45:17,298 --> 00:45:21,219
