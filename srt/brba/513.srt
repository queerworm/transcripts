196
00:08:06,445 --> 00:08:09,448
Safe house off Rio Bravo.

197
00:08:09,448 --> 00:08:11,908
We've got Van Oster

198
00:08:09,448 --> 00:08:11,908
babysitting him.

199
00:08:11,908 --> 00:08:15,078
Yeah. What about Van Oster?

200
00:08:11,908 --> 00:08:15,078
Did he have any questions?

201
00:08:15,078 --> 00:08:17,538
Probably, but he knows better

202
00:08:15,078 --> 00:08:17,538
than to ask.

203
00:08:17,538 --> 00:08:18,957
Good job.

204
00:08:18,957 --> 00:08:21,126
I gotta tell you this up front,

205
00:08:18,957 --> 00:08:21,126
Hank.

206
00:08:21,126 --> 00:08:23,462
If this guy decides

207
00:08:21,126 --> 00:08:23,462
he wants to lawyer up

208
00:08:23,462 --> 00:08:24,879
I don't care

209
00:08:23,462 --> 00:08:24,879
if you are my boss,

210
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:27,215
I'm gonna put

211
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:27,215
a stop to this.

212
00:08:27,215 --> 00:08:29,426
He won't lawyer up.

213
00:08:44,565 --> 00:08:46,067
What the hell, man?

214
00:09:07,381 --> 00:09:08,965
You're up.

215
00:09:08,965 --> 00:09:11,551
[KNOCKING ON DOOR]

216
00:09:18,392 --> 00:09:20,852
Hey there. You mind

217
00:09:18,392 --> 00:09:20,852
taking it outside for a minute?

218
00:09:20,852 --> 00:09:23,397
No, sir. You got it.

219
00:09:20,852 --> 00:09:23,397
All right, thanks.

220
00:09:23,397 --> 00:09:26,024
Huell Babineaux.

221
00:09:27,526 --> 00:09:29,528
Know who I am?

222
00:09:31,238 --> 00:09:33,407
I'll take that as a yes.

223
00:09:33,407 --> 00:09:35,492
Thanks for your patience.

224
00:09:35,492 --> 00:09:40,830
As Agent Gomez said,

225
00:09:35,492 --> 00:09:40,830
you're not under arrest.

226
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:42,416
Why am I here?

227
00:09:42,416 --> 00:09:45,835
Well, you're here

228
00:09:42,416 --> 00:09:45,835
for your own protection, sir.

229
00:09:45,835 --> 00:09:47,504
How you figure that?

230
00:09:47,504 --> 00:09:51,091
Well, we both know how dangerous

231
00:09:47,504 --> 00:09:51,091
my brother-in-law can be.

232
00:09:55,262 --> 00:09:57,097
Nice poker face.

233
00:09:57,097 --> 00:09:59,057
Look, relax.

234
00:09:59,057 --> 00:10:02,018
There's not much new you can

235
00:09:59,057 --> 00:10:02,018
tell me about Walter White.

236
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:03,811
Multiple murders,

237
00:10:03,811 --> 00:10:06,106
ties to a white-power

238
00:10:03,811 --> 00:10:06,106
prison gang,

239
00:10:06,106 --> 00:10:08,983
ran the largest meth racket

240
00:10:06,106 --> 00:10:08,983
in the entire Southwest.

241
00:10:08,983 --> 00:10:11,445
I'm not asking,

242
00:10:08,983 --> 00:10:11,445
you're not answering,

243
00:10:11,445 --> 00:10:13,613
whoop-de-do.

244
00:10:11,445 --> 00:10:13,613
Let's cut to the chase.

245
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:15,907
We have a wire on Walt's phone.

246
00:10:15,907 --> 00:10:18,118
We intercepted a call

247
00:10:15,907 --> 00:10:18,118
between him

248
00:10:18,118 --> 00:10:20,620
and a certain Saul Goodman,

249
00:10:18,118 --> 00:10:20,620
Esq.

250
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:23,373
You know, your employer?

251
00:10:23,373 --> 00:10:26,543
Anyway, in the call, Walt said

252
00:10:23,373 --> 00:10:26,543
that he was going to, quote:

253
00:10:26,543 --> 00:10:29,129
"Take care of one

254
00:10:26,543 --> 00:10:29,129
Jesse Pinkman," unquote,

255
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:31,172
and that you were next

256
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:31,172
on the hit list.

257
00:10:31,172 --> 00:10:32,507
That's why you're here.

258
00:10:32,507 --> 00:10:34,801
Bullshit.

259
00:10:32,507 --> 00:10:34,801
That don't make no sense.

260
00:10:34,801 --> 00:10:37,262
I got the recording.

261
00:10:34,801 --> 00:10:37,262
I can-- I can let you hear it.

262
00:10:37,262 --> 00:10:39,931
Your associate, Goodman's

263
00:10:37,262 --> 00:10:39,931
fixer-- What's his name?

264
00:10:39,931 --> 00:10:42,267
Some carrottop

265
00:10:39,931 --> 00:10:42,267
named Patrick Kuby.

266
00:10:42,267 --> 00:10:44,894
Boston P.D. ran him out

267
00:10:42,267 --> 00:10:44,894
of Beantown a few years back.

268
00:10:44,894 --> 00:10:46,480
Came out here

269
00:10:44,894 --> 00:10:46,480
for the sunshine.

270
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,273
Walt said he was gonna do

271
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,273
this Kuby guy

272
00:10:48,273 --> 00:10:49,566
the same way he does you.

273
00:10:49,566 --> 00:10:51,985
In fact,

274
00:10:49,566 --> 00:10:51,985
Kuby's already missing.

275
00:10:51,985 --> 00:10:54,362
Sorry to say, things are looking

276
00:10:51,985 --> 00:10:54,362
grim for your--

277
00:10:54,362 --> 00:10:55,863
Your redheaded buddy.

278
00:10:55,863 --> 00:10:59,159
Believe us, don't believe us.

279
00:10:55,863 --> 00:10:59,159
Suit yourself.

280
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:01,578
Whatever you do,

281
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:01,578
I would not call Goodman.

282
00:11:01,578 --> 00:11:03,830
He sold you down the river

283
00:11:01,578 --> 00:11:03,830
bigtime.

284
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:06,416
The hell you talking about?

285
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:06,416
Don't take it personally.

286
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:07,917
Goodman's next

287
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:07,917
on the chopping block

288
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:09,628
if he doesn't do

289
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:09,628
what White says.

290
00:11:09,628 --> 00:11:11,630
To be fair,

291
00:11:09,628 --> 00:11:11,630
your circus clown of a boss

292
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:13,507
did try to spare you for all of,

293
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:13,507
what,

294
00:11:13,507 --> 00:11:15,592
about 15 seconds

295
00:11:15,592 --> 00:11:18,052
before he decided

296
00:11:15,592 --> 00:11:18,052
to help Walt track you down.

297
00:11:18,052 --> 00:11:20,888
You see, Goodman's got

298
00:11:18,052 --> 00:11:20,888
a trace on your phone

299
00:11:20,888 --> 00:11:22,557
and as soon as you call him

300
00:11:22,557 --> 00:11:24,725
Walt will find out

301
00:11:22,557 --> 00:11:24,725
where you're hiding.

302
00:11:24,725 --> 00:11:28,229
Then it's just a matter of time

303
00:11:24,725 --> 00:11:28,229
before you end up like this.

304
00:11:30,148 --> 00:11:32,150
Oh, man. Oh, man.

305
00:11:30,148 --> 00:11:32,150
I swear to God,

306
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:33,776
I didn't know he was gonna

307
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:33,776
kill the man.

308
00:11:33,776 --> 00:11:35,362
I didn't know

309
00:11:33,776 --> 00:11:35,362
he was gonna kill him.

310
00:11:35,362 --> 00:11:36,988
Relax.

311
00:11:36,988 --> 00:11:39,449
If we thought you did,

312
00:11:36,988 --> 00:11:39,449
you'd be in lockup

313
00:11:39,449 --> 00:11:40,867
for conspiracy

314
00:11:39,449 --> 00:11:40,867
to commit murder

315
00:11:40,867 --> 00:11:42,452
instead of here

316
00:11:40,867 --> 00:11:42,452
under our protection.

317
00:11:42,452 --> 00:11:44,120
Tell us everything you know

318
00:11:42,452 --> 00:11:44,120
about White

319
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:46,080
so we can get him

320
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:46,080
before he gets you.

321
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,915
Why would he wanna kill me?

322
00:11:47,915 --> 00:11:50,377
I ain't do nothing.

323
00:11:47,915 --> 00:11:50,377
HANK: Who knows with this guy?

324
00:11:50,377 --> 00:11:52,546
From what he said,

325
00:11:50,377 --> 00:11:52,546
it may have to do

326
00:11:52,546 --> 00:11:54,088
with him tying up loose ends

327
00:11:54,088 --> 00:11:56,550
regarding poisoning

328
00:11:54,088 --> 00:11:56,550
some kid named Brock.

329
00:11:58,134 --> 00:12:01,179
Or maybe it's because

330
00:11:58,134 --> 00:12:01,179
you know where his money is.

331
00:12:01,179 --> 00:12:03,097
I don't know where his money is.

332
00:12:03,097 --> 00:12:04,723
That ain't what we heard.

333
00:12:04,723 --> 00:12:06,725
You ain't listening

334
00:12:04,723 --> 00:12:06,725
to the people in the know.

335
00:12:06,725 --> 00:12:08,978
Me and Kuby rented a van

336
00:12:06,725 --> 00:12:08,978
for the dude,

337
00:12:08,978 --> 00:12:11,856
loaded his cash up

338
00:12:08,978 --> 00:12:11,856
in a self-storage unit

339
00:12:11,856 --> 00:12:14,568
handed over the keys to him

340
00:12:11,856 --> 00:12:14,568
at Goodman's.

341
00:12:14,568 --> 00:12:16,861
Who knows where he took it

342
00:12:14,568 --> 00:12:16,861
from there?

343
00:12:16,861 --> 00:12:19,822
A van, huh?

344
00:12:16,861 --> 00:12:19,822
How much money we talking?

345
00:12:19,822 --> 00:12:21,991
Seven barrels' worth.

346
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:23,577
Seven barrels?

347
00:12:25,245 --> 00:12:29,082
When you say "barrels,"

348
00:12:25,245 --> 00:12:29,082
you mean "barrels" barrels?

349
00:12:29,082 --> 00:12:34,462
Barrels, man. You know,

350
00:12:29,082 --> 00:12:34,462
plastic, black, 55-gallon type.

351
00:12:34,462 --> 00:12:35,963
I got them at Home Depot.

352
00:12:35,963 --> 00:12:39,509
Filled up every last damn

353
00:12:35,963 --> 00:12:39,509
one of them too.

354
00:12:39,509 --> 00:12:42,011
And where did you rent the van?

355
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:46,015
Lariat. The one

356
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:46,015
on Candelaria and Monroe.

357
00:12:47,601 --> 00:12:50,604
Lariat on Candelaria?

358
00:12:47,601 --> 00:12:50,604
Yeah.

359
00:12:50,604 --> 00:12:54,148
Kuby rented the van.

360
00:12:50,604 --> 00:12:54,148
Mr. White dropped it off.

361
00:12:54,148 --> 00:12:57,068
He had us wash it good

362
00:12:54,148 --> 00:12:57,068
before Kuby took it back.

363
00:12:57,068 --> 00:12:58,612
Wash the rental? Why?

364
00:12:58,612 --> 00:13:01,448
It was filthy, man,

365
00:12:58,612 --> 00:13:01,448
like he went off-road with it.

366
00:13:01,448 --> 00:13:02,616
After we had hosed it down,

367
00:13:02,616 --> 00:13:04,451
he grabbed a shovel

368
00:13:02,616 --> 00:13:04,451
out the back

369
00:13:04,451 --> 00:13:07,370
handed over the key,

370
00:13:04,451 --> 00:13:07,370
and that was it.

371
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:08,871
That's all I know.

372
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:15,503
All right, Mr. Babineaux.

373
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:20,091
Agent Gomez and I are going

374
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:20,091
to do everything we can

375
00:13:20,091 --> 00:13:21,593
to find this son of a bitch.

376
00:13:21,593 --> 00:13:23,344
Like I said, you're free to go.

377
00:13:23,344 --> 00:13:26,514
But if I were you, I wouldn't

378
00:13:23,344 --> 00:13:26,514
take one step out that door.

379
00:13:26,514 --> 00:13:29,267
GOMEZ:

380
00:13:26,514 --> 00:13:29,267
And remember, no phone calls.

381
00:13:29,267 --> 00:13:30,935
Oh, actually, I almost forgot.

382
00:13:30,935 --> 00:13:33,062
Uh, I took the liberty

383
00:13:30,935 --> 00:13:33,062
of removing the battery

384
00:13:33,062 --> 00:13:35,649
so Walt can't track you

385
00:13:33,062 --> 00:13:35,649

386
00:13:35,649 --> 00:13:38,526
So don't put that back in.

Agent Van Oster

388
00:13:38,526 --> 00:13:40,819
will stay here with you.

00:13:40,819 --> 00:13:43,281
You're in good hands.

He's our best man with a gun.

391
00:13:43,281 --> 00:13:45,283
Don't discuss the case with him

392
00:13:45,283 --> 00:13:48,035
because the less

393
00:13:45,283 --> 00:13:48,035
you distract him

394
00:13:48,035 --> 00:13:50,955
the better

395
00:13:48,035 --> 00:13:50,955
he can protect you.

396
00:13:50,955 --> 00:13:53,583
How long you gonna be?

397
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:56,461
As long as it takes

398
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:56,461

00:14:08,348 --> 00:14:11,017
So just one guy this time.

401
00:14:11,017 --> 00:14:13,436
Not even in lockup.

402
00:14:16,272 --> 00:14:19,317
Some former partner, Todd says?

403
00:14:21,486 --> 00:14:22,737
Yeah.

404
00:14:22,737 --> 00:14:25,072
So, what are we talking,

405
00:14:22,737 --> 00:14:25,072
rat patrol?

406
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:29,619
Rat p--?

407
00:14:29,619 --> 00:14:31,329
No, no.

408
00:14:31,329 --> 00:14:35,834
Rat patrol?

409
00:14:31,329 --> 00:14:35,834
No. No, he's not a rat.

410
00:14:35,834 --> 00:14:38,252
He's just...

411
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:44,300
He just won't listen to reason.

412
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:46,636
Okay.

413
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:46,636
He's just angry.

414
00:14:46,636 --> 00:14:48,346
He's not a rat.

00:14:48,346 --> 00:14:51,349
All right.

Angry non-rat. Got it.

418
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:55,645
How angry we talking,

419
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:55,645
by the way?

420
00:14:55,645 --> 00:14:57,564
Like, Hulk angry?

421
00:14:57,564 --> 00:15:02,610
Like, Rambo-James Bond

422
00:14:57,564 --> 00:15:02,610
badass individual?

423
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:08,700
Not something you'd do yourself,

424
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:08,700
huh?

425
00:15:10,618 --> 00:15:12,746
Jesse is like family to me.

426
00:15:14,205 --> 00:15:18,793
Look, I want what you do

427
00:15:14,205 --> 00:15:18,793

I respect that.

00:15:25,966 --> 00:15:27,552
There's too many savages

00:15:25,966 --> 00:15:27,552
out there.

434
00:15:27,552 --> 00:15:29,470

435
00:15:27,552 --> 00:15:29,470

436
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:31,890
No, we don't want your money.

00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:47,781
I'm out of the business.

441
00:15:47,781 --> 00:15:50,533
Just a couple times to tutor

Get the color right too.

446
00:15:56,289 --> 00:15:59,292
Apparently that blue touch

447
00:15:56,289 --> 00:15:59,292
you put on it,

450
00:16:01,795 --> 00:16:04,046
So I'm told.

451
00:16:01,795 --> 00:16:04,046
No.

452
00:16:04,046 --> 00:16:06,006
Absolutely not.

457
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:13,598
from the blue stuff.

after the job is done.

on you like this,

have a moment to talk with you.

00:18:23,937 --> 00:18:26,522
to reach him for days.

512
00:18:26,522 --> 00:18:28,148
I've stopped at his house,

513
00:18:28,148 --> 00:18:30,985
I've left all kinds of

514
00:18:28,148 --> 00:18:30,985
messages on his voicemail

515
00:18:30,985 --> 00:18:34,238
and he won't return my calls.

00:18:30,985 --> 00:18:34,238

No, not since the last time

00:18:35,865 --> 00:18:38,826
he called to check on Brock.

I have a bad feeling

526
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:52,757
about this.

527
00:18:54,174 --> 00:18:56,594
Have you tried

528
00:18:54,174 --> 00:18:56,594
calling the police?

529
00:18:59,263 --> 00:19:00,974
Or a better idea.

530
00:19:00,974 --> 00:19:03,183
Jesse's lawyer's name

531
00:19:00,974 --> 00:19:03,183
is Saul Goodman.

532
00:19:03,183 --> 00:19:04,477
I have his card somewhere.

533
00:19:04,477 --> 00:19:06,145
I mean, he may have ways

534
00:19:04,477 --> 00:19:06,145
of finding Jesse

535
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:08,022
without getting him

536
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:08,022

00:19:08,022 --> 00:19:11,358
"Better call Saul."

538
00:19:08,022 --> 00:19:11,358
Yeah. I-- I did that.

539
00:19:11,358 --> 00:19:13,736
He was able to verify

540
00:19:11,358 --> 00:19:13,736
that Jesse's not locked up,

541
00:19:13,736 --> 00:19:18,282
but, otherwise,

542
00:19:13,736 --> 00:19:18,282
very little help.

543
00:19:19,742 --> 00:19:21,368
You see, the thing is,

544
00:19:21,368 --> 00:19:24,664
is that Jesse and I

545
00:19:21,368 --> 00:19:24,664
had this argument recently.

546
00:19:24,664 --> 00:19:30,044
And I won't bore you

547
00:19:24,664 --> 00:19:30,044
with the details, but he's...

548
00:19:30,044 --> 00:19:34,924
He's-- He's pretty upset

549
00:19:30,044 --> 00:19:34,924
with me and...

550
00:19:34,924 --> 00:19:37,844
And I'm hoping that's the reason

551
00:19:34,924 --> 00:19:37,844
he hasn't called me back

552
00:19:37,844 --> 00:19:42,431
instead of him being...

553
00:19:42,431 --> 00:19:44,809
Well...

554
00:19:47,145 --> 00:19:49,229
Well,

555
00:19:47,145 --> 00:19:49,229
I'll try him right now.

556
00:19:49,229 --> 00:19:52,399
I mean, if that's it,

557
00:19:49,229 --> 00:19:52,399
he's mad at you,

558
00:19:52,399 --> 00:19:56,362
maybe I'll have better luck.

559
00:19:52,399 --> 00:19:56,362
That would be such a help. Yes.

560
00:19:56,362 --> 00:19:59,281

561
00:19:56,362 --> 00:19:59,281
are you calling him on?

562
00:19:59,281 --> 00:20:00,658
Um, his cell.

00:20:00,658 --> 00:20:03,577

00:20:00,658 --> 00:20:03,577
he recently got a new one.

565
00:20:03,577 --> 00:20:05,454
And there. That--

566
00:20:05,454 --> 00:20:08,916
That's his new number there,

567
00:20:05,454 --> 00:20:08,916
