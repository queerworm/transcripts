Dad made sure.

773
00:42:22,123 --> 00:42:25,710
And I promise to always go

774
00:42:22,123 --> 00:42:25,710
the speed limit. Or below.

775
00:42:25,710 --> 00:42:27,170
Way below.

776
00:42:27,170 --> 00:42:31,424
And it gets great gas mileage.

777
00:42:32,967 --> 00:42:36,762
So Dad said I can take it around

778
00:42:32,967 --> 00:42:36,762
the block a few times.

779
00:42:36,762 --> 00:42:40,475
That okay?

780
00:42:36,762 --> 00:42:40,475
Just around the block.

781
00:42:40,475 --> 00:42:44,145
Yeah.

782
00:42:40,475 --> 00:42:44,145
Just around the block.

783
00:42:44,145 --> 00:42:46,064
And be careful, okay?

784
00:42:46,064 --> 00:42:48,525
I will.

785
00:42:48,525 --> 00:42:50,193
Bye.

786
00:42:52,153 --> 00:42:54,364
It's really--

787
00:42:54,364 --> 00:42:56,657
It's really great

788
00:42:54,364 --> 00:42:56,657
to have you home, Mom.

789
00:43:03,581 --> 00:43:06,543
WALT:

790
00:43:03,581 --> 00:43:06,543
Hey, seriously,

791
00:43:03,581 --> 00:43:06,543
be careful. Okay?

792
00:43:06,543 --> 00:43:08,753
I will.

793
00:43:06,543 --> 00:43:08,753
Okay.

794
00:43:26,396 --> 00:43:29,107
I guess we should talk.

795
00:43:29,107 --> 00:43:32,026
Well, I think you said plenty

796
00:43:29,107 --> 00:43:32,026
the other day.

797
00:43:32,026 --> 00:43:36,573
Look, about that,

798
00:43:32,026 --> 00:43:36,573
it just...

799
00:43:36,573 --> 00:43:40,201
Did you get

800
00:43:36,573 --> 00:43:40,201
the car wash keys?

801
00:43:40,201 --> 00:43:44,289
Yes. Yes. Here.

802
00:43:50,378 --> 00:43:56,884
Skyler, I may have

803
00:43:50,378 --> 00:43:56,884
overstated things earlier,

804
00:43:56,884 --> 00:44:01,764
and I'm sorry

805
00:43:56,884 --> 00:44:01,764
to be so forward.

806
00:44:01,764 --> 00:44:05,726
But I just--

807
00:44:01,764 --> 00:44:05,726
I want you to know something.

808
00:44:05,726 --> 00:44:07,812
I want you to--

809
00:44:07,812 --> 00:44:10,731
I need you to understand

810
00:44:10,731 --> 00:44:12,858
that you are safe.

811
00:44:12,858 --> 00:44:15,778
You, Junior, Holly.

812
00:44:15,778 --> 00:44:19,491
You are completely safe.

813
00:44:19,491 --> 00:44:23,369
Everything that I do,

814
00:44:19,491 --> 00:44:23,369
everything...

815
00:44:23,369 --> 00:44:26,623
I do it

816
00:44:23,369 --> 00:44:26,623
to protect this family.

817
00:44:28,124 --> 00:44:32,795
So buying that car,

818
00:44:28,124 --> 00:44:32,795
that was protecting your family?

819
00:44:35,089 --> 00:44:38,343
Okay. I...

820
00:44:38,343 --> 00:44:42,138
Maybe it's a little flashy,

821
00:44:38,343 --> 00:44:42,138
but he needed a car.

822
00:44:43,889 --> 00:44:48,353
And I'm his father, and I should

823
00:44:43,889 --> 00:44:48,353
be able to get what he wants.

824
00:44:50,938 --> 00:44:53,941
It goes back.

825
00:44:53,941 --> 00:44:55,276
Tomorrow.

826
00:44:55,276 --> 00:44:58,821
Skyler, it will crush him.

827
00:45:00,072 --> 00:45:04,035
That car directly contradicts

828
00:45:00,072 --> 00:45:04,035
our story.

829
00:45:04,035 --> 00:45:07,830
And if you're so invested

830
00:45:04,035 --> 00:45:07,830
in protecting this family,

831
00:45:07,830 --> 00:45:10,791
it means protecting the story.

832
00:45:10,791 --> 00:45:13,961
What do you think the neighbors

833
00:45:10,791 --> 00:45:13,961
are going to say, Walt?

834
00:45:13,961 --> 00:45:15,547
What about Hank and Marie?

835
00:45:15,547 --> 00:45:19,676
How about the IRS?

836
00:45:15,547 --> 00:45:19,676
What were you thinking, Walt?

837
00:45:19,676 --> 00:45:24,805
I was thinking I wanted

838
00:45:19,676 --> 00:45:24,805
to do something nice for my son.

839
00:45:33,231 --> 00:45:35,191
Look.

840
00:45:36,942 --> 00:45:40,697
I just worry

841
00:45:36,942 --> 00:45:40,697
that he'll blame you for this.

842
00:45:44,075 --> 00:45:46,411
Oh, he will.

843
00:45:46,411 --> 00:45:49,080
Once again,

844
00:45:46,411 --> 00:45:49,080
he'll blame his bitch mother

845
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:51,790
for taking away what

846
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:51,790
his loving father has given him,

847
00:45:51,790 --> 00:45:55,503
so thanks for that.

848
00:45:56,879 --> 00:45:58,214
[SIGHS]

849
00:45:58,214 --> 00:46:01,092
But you know what, Walt?

850
00:46:01,092 --> 00:46:03,302
Someone has to protect

851
00:46:01,092 --> 00:46:03,302
this family

852
00:46:03,302 --> 00:46:06,847
from the man

853
00:46:03,302 --> 00:46:06,847
who protects this family.

854
00:46:31,122 --> 00:46:33,332
