OF SULIBAN HERE.
WHY NOT ASK THEM?

GRAT: WE BOTH KNOW
THEY WOULDN'T BE VERY HELPFUL.

350

THEN WHY ARE THEY IN PRISON?

351
00:22:06,242 --> 00:22:08,286

FOR ANOTHER TIME.

GRAT: THE LAST THING
WE WANTED TO DO

359
00:22:24,677 --> 00:22:26,470
WAS BUILD
THESE DETENTION CENTERS.

360
00:22:26,512 --> 00:22:28,681
BUT WE HAD NO CHOICE.

361
00:22:28,722 --> 00:22:31,100
WHEN THE CABAL
BEGAN THEIR ACTIVITIES,

362
00:22:31,142 --> 00:22:33,936
THERE WAS A GREAT DEAL OF FEAR
AMONG THE TANDARANS.

363
00:22:33,978 --> 00:22:36,230
THERE WERE INSTANCES
OF VIOLENCE.

364

14 INNOCENT SULIBAN WERE KILLED
IN ONE DAY ALONE.

365
00:22:39,608 --> 00:22:42,653
WE HAD TO FIND A WAY
TO KEEP THEM OUT OF DANGER.

366
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:48,284
ARCHER: THEN WHY NOT JUST LET
THEM FIND ANOTHER PLACE TO LIVE?

367
00:22:48,326 --> 00:22:50,203
GRAT: THEY WOULDN'T
GET VERY FAR.

368
00:22:50,244 --> 00:22:53,164
IT'S IRONIC, BUT ONCE THEY'RE
OUT OF TANDARAN TERRITORY,

369
00:22:53,206 --> 00:22:56,500
THE CABAL WILL HUNT THEM DOWN
AND TURN THEM ALL INTO SOLDIERS.
