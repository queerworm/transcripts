YOU WON'T HAVE
TO ANSWER TO HIM ANY LONGER.

WHERE YOU STAND.

YOU HELPED ME BEFORE.

348
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:39,159

THIS IS OUR FATHER.

349
00:18:40,369 --> 00:18:41,662
HE MAY HAVE RAISED US,

350
00:18:41,662 --> 00:18:43,372
BUT THAT DOESN'T
MAKE HIM OUR FATHER.

351
00:18:43,372 --> 00:18:45,041
HE'LL NEVER BE ONE OF US.

00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:48,669
-DON'T DO THIS TO HIM.
-HE'S GIVEN ME NO CHOICE.

TALK TO HIM YOURSELF.
