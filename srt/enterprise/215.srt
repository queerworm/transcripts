TO MEET YOU,

667
00:37:14,399 --> 00:37:18,195
AND WE DAMN NEAR GOT KILLED
GETTING HIM HERE.

668
00:37:18,236 --> 00:37:20,655
I CAME BECAUSE YOU ASKED ME,

669
00:37:20,697 --> 00:37:23,366
BECAUSE YOU THOUGHT
I COULD BE TRUSTED.

670
00:37:23,408 --> 00:37:25,577
CHECK SOVAL'S WOUND.

671
00:37:25,618 --> 00:37:27,079
CHECK OUR SHUTTLE.

672
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:29,122
YOU'LL FIND
ANDORIAN WEAPONS SIGNATURES.

673
00:37:38,924 --> 00:37:40,217
ALIEN: IS THIS TRUE?

674
00:37:42,969 --> 00:37:45,388
ANSWER ME!

675
00:37:45,430 --> 00:37:47,306
TARAH: WHAT DID YOU
EXPECT ME TO DO?

676
00:37:47,348 --> 00:37:49,935
ALIEN: FOLLOW MY ORDERS!

677
00:37:49,976 --> 00:37:54,397
TARAH: ORDERS TO DO NOTHING
WHILE YOU BETRAY US?

678
00:37:54,439 --> 00:37:56,942
IT'S NOT TOO LATE
TO REDEEM YOURSELF,

679
00:37:56,983 --> 00:37:59,444
TO MAKE A STAND.

680
00:37:59,485 --> 00:38:00,695
ALIEN: I INTEND TO.

681
00:38:04,323 --> 00:38:05,366
TAKE HER.

682
00:38:07,244 --> 00:38:10,455
TARAH: THERE ARE OTHERS
WHO FEEL THIS WAY.

683
00:38:10,496 --> 00:38:11,581
YOU'LL SEE.

684
00:38:19,881 --> 00:38:21,549
ALIEN:
SEE TO THE AMBASSADOR'S WOUNDS.

685
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:25,303
WE HAVE A LOT TO DISCUSS.

686
00:38:31,977 --> 00:38:33,561
THE VULCAN SHIPS
ARE BREAKING FORMATION.

687
00:38:33,603 --> 00:38:35,438
THEY'RE HEADING
FOR THE PLANET.

688
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:37,149
TRAVIS: THE ANDORIANS
ARE FOLLOWING, SIR.

689
00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:38,817
TUCKER: ARM THE FORWARD
PHASE CANNONS.

690
00:38:38,858 --> 00:38:40,526
SEE IF YOU CAN TARGET
THEIR WEAPONS.

691
00:38:40,568 --> 00:38:42,361
WE'RE BEING HAILED
FROM THE SURFACE.

692
00:38:42,403 --> 00:38:43,613
IT'S THE CAPTAIN.

693
00:38:43,655 --> 00:38:45,406
TUCKER: HOLD OFF, MALCOLM.

694
00:38:45,448 --> 00:38:46,491
PUT HIM THROUGH.

695
00:38:47,659 --> 00:38:48,785
CAPTAIN.

696
00:38:48,827 --> 00:38:50,703
ARCHER: NICE TO HEAR
YOUR VOICE, TRIP.

697
00:38:50,745 --> 00:38:53,957
TUCKER: WHAT'S GOING ON
DOWN THERE?
ARE YOU OKAY?

698
00:38:53,999 --> 00:38:55,333
ARCHER: T'POL AND I ARE FINE.

699
00:38:55,374 --> 00:38:57,210
WE'RE AT THE ANDORIAN
COMMAND POST.

700
00:38:57,252 --> 00:38:58,878
AMBASSADOR SOVAL'S BEEN INJURED,

701
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:01,131
BUT SHRAN'S MEDICS
ARE TREATING HIM.

702
00:39:01,173 --> 00:39:02,841
DID YOU SAY SHRAN'S MEDICS?

703
00:39:02,882 --> 00:39:04,801
ARCHER: HE'S JUST
BEING A GOOD HOST.

704
00:39:04,843 --> 00:39:06,803
THE ANDORIANS ARE ALLOWING
THE VULCAN SHIPS

705
00:39:06,845 --> 00:39:09,055
TO MOVE IN AND PICK UP
THEIR PEOPLE.

706
00:39:09,097 --> 00:39:10,431
GLAD YOU LET US KNOW.

707
00:39:10,473 --> 00:39:14,393
ARCHER: DID YOU RUN INTO
ANY PROBLEMS UP THERE?

708
00:39:14,435 --> 00:39:17,647
NOTHING WE COULDN'T HANDLE.
I'LL FILL YOU IN LATER.

709
00:39:17,689 --> 00:39:19,274
ARCHER: WE HAD
A PRETTY ROUGH LANDING.

710
00:39:19,316 --> 00:39:20,859
WE'LL NEED A RIDE
BACK TO THE SHIP.

711
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:22,861
I'LL SEND TRAVIS DOWN
IN<i> SHUTTLEPOD 2.</i>

712
00:39:22,902 --> 00:39:26,405
ARCHER: ACKNOWLEDGED.
ARCHER OUT.

713
00:39:26,447 --> 00:39:30,409
TUCKER:
PUT US BACK IN ORBIT, TRAVIS,
AND CANCEL THE TACTICAL ALERT.

714
00:39:33,163 --> 00:39:35,665
ARCHER: CAPTAIN'S STARLOG,
SUPPLEMENTAL.

715
00:39:35,707 --> 00:39:38,918
AMBASSADOR SOVAL HAS BEGUN
TALKS WITH THE ANDORIANS.

716
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:42,672
THEY'VE BEEN DIFFICULT,
BUT PRODUCTIVE.

717
00:39:42,714 --> 00:39:45,800
THE IMPERIAL COUNCIL
WILL NOT BE SATISFIED

718
00:39:45,842 --> 00:39:50,805
UNTIL VULCAN RECOGNIZES
OUR CLAIM TO WEYTAHN.

719
00:39:50,847 --> 00:39:53,016
ARCHER: I BELIEVE SOMEONE
ONCE DEFINED A COMPROMISE

720
00:39:53,058 --> 00:39:57,436
AS A SOLUTION THAT NEITHER SIDE
IS HAPPY WITH.

721
00:39:57,478 --> 00:40:01,024
ALIEN: IN THAT CASE, THESE TALKS
HAVE BEEN EXTREMELY SUCCESSFUL.

722
00:40:01,066 --> 00:40:04,694
SOVAL:
I CONSIDER ANY NEGOTIATION
THAT AVERTS WAR TO BE A SUCCESS.

723
00:40:11,034 --> 00:40:14,537
ALIEN: JOIN ME...IN A DRINK...

724
00:40:14,579 --> 00:40:16,581
TO CELEBRATE...

725
00:40:16,622 --> 00:40:19,709
OUR MUTUAL DISSATISFACTION.

726
00:40:19,751 --> 00:40:21,127
SOVAL: VULCANS DON'T DRINK.

727
00:40:26,174 --> 00:40:28,634
BUT THIS OCCASION
MERITS AN EXCEPTION.

728
00:40:38,311 --> 00:40:39,979
TO THE CEASE-FIRE.

729
00:40:40,021 --> 00:40:41,273
IT WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE

730
00:40:41,314 --> 00:40:43,942
WITHOUT THE HELP
OF OUR HUMAN FRIENDS.

731
00:40:43,983 --> 00:40:47,112
SOVAL: AND TO THE SUCCESSFUL
CONTINUATION OF THESE TALKS

732
00:40:47,153 --> 00:40:49,030
ON ANDORIA.

733
00:40:49,072 --> 00:40:52,491
I TRUST THERE'LL BE MORE
ACCOMPLISHED THAN JUST TALK.

734
00:41:06,965 --> 00:41:08,466
T'POL: WITH YOUR PERMISSION,

735
00:41:08,507 --> 00:41:10,969
I'LL ESCORT AMBASSADOR SOVAL
TO THE AIRLOCK.

736
00:41:11,010 --> 00:41:12,053
OF COURSE.

737
00:41:19,018 --> 00:41:21,271
SOVAL: CAPTAIN.

738
00:41:21,313 --> 00:41:25,524
YOUR PRESENCE HERE
HAS NOT BEEN...

739
00:41:25,566 --> 00:41:26,651
OVERLY MEDDLESOME.

740
00:41:41,374 --> 00:41:43,418
ALIEN: I THINK HE LIKES YOU,
PINK-SKIN.

741
00:41:45,962 --> 00:41:47,255
ARCHER: I WOULDN'T GO THAT FAR.
