00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:23,644
THAT SILIK KILLED YOU.

340
00:18:23,686 --> 00:18:27,440
HE DID.
IN A MANNER OF SPEAKING.

341
00:18:27,481 --> 00:18:29,108
WE HAVE TO TALK, CAPTAIN,
AND IT'S ESSENTIAL

342
00:18:29,149 --> 00:18:31,277
THAT NONE OF THE OTHER FACTIONS
KNOW ABOUT IT.

343
00:18:31,318 --> 00:18:33,738
I DOUBT ANY OF THEM WOULD THINK
I'D BRING YOU HERE.

344
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:37,700
ARCHER: SO YOU'RE
TELLING ME YOU...

345
00:18:37,742 --> 00:18:42,956
BROUGHT ME BACK, WHAT,
10 MONTHS AGO?

346
00:18:42,997 --> 00:18:46,793
HOW ABOUT JONATHAN ARCHER
10 MONTHS AGO? WHERE'S HE?

347
00:18:46,834 --> 00:18:48,795
HE'S YOU.

348
00:18:51,422 --> 00:18:54,300
THEN WHO JUST CLIMBED INTO BED
ABOARD "ENTERPRISE"?

349
00:18:54,341 --> 00:18:56,886
THAT HASN'T HAPPENED YET.

350
00:18:56,928 --> 00:18:58,972
THAT'S A LOAD OF CRAP,
AND YOU KNOW IT.

351
00:18:59,013 --> 00:19:01,015
I'VE HAD THIS CONVERSATION

352
00:19:01,057 --> 00:19:02,600
WITH HALF A DOZEN PEOPLE.

353
00:19:02,642 --> 00:19:04,018
IT ALWAYS ENDS UP THE SAME WAY.

354
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:06,228
ARCHER: CAN'T YOU EVER
GIVE A STRAIGHT ANSWER?

355
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,107
IT DEPENDS ON THE QUESTION.

356
00:19:11,442 --> 00:19:16,155
ARCHER: ALL RIGHT.
TRY THIS ONE.

357
00:19:16,196 --> 00:19:18,407
WHY AM I HERE?

358
00:19:18,449 --> 00:19:20,868
I THOUGHT YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO
PROTECT THE TIMELINE,

359
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:22,453
NOT SCREW WITH IT.

360
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:25,915
IT'S ALREADY BEEN
"SCREWED WITH," CAPTAIN.

361
00:19:25,957 --> 00:19:27,291
THAT EXPLOSION
AT THE PARAAGAN COLONY,

362
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:28,960
IT WASN'T SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN.

363
00:19:29,002 --> 00:19:30,503
ARCHER: OF COURSE IT WASN'T.
IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.

364
00:19:30,544 --> 00:19:31,879
DANIELS: THAT'S NOT WHAT I MEAN.

365
00:19:31,921 --> 00:19:35,341
HISTORY NEVER RECORDED
THE DISASTER.

366
00:19:35,382 --> 00:19:38,218
SOMEONE
VIOLATED THE TEMPORAL ACCORD--

367
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:40,554
SOMEONE WHO DOESN'T WANT
YOUR MISSION TO SUCCEED.

368
00:19:42,473 --> 00:19:43,891
ARE YOU TELLING ME
THAT "ENTERPRISE"

369
00:19:43,933 --> 00:19:46,393
DIDN'T CAUSE THAT EXPLOSION?

370
00:19:46,435 --> 00:19:48,104
DANIELS: DO YOU REMEMBER THE
TEMPORAL COLD WAR I SPOKE OF?

371
00:19:48,146 --> 00:19:49,772
ARCHER:
IT'S KIND OF HARD TO FORGET.

372
00:19:49,814 --> 00:19:51,273
DANIELS:
THEN LISTEN TO ME CAREFULLY.

373
00:19:51,315 --> 00:19:53,400
WE DON'T HAVE MUCH TIME.

374
00:20:01,117 --> 00:20:04,203
ALL SENIOR STAFF REPORT TO THE
SITUATION ROOM IN 15 MINUTES.

375
00:20:04,244 --> 00:20:06,580
MR. REED, I'D LIKE YOU
IN MY QUARTERS IMMEDIATELY.

376
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:19,635
REED: IT WAS JUST WHERE
WE DETECTED THE E.M. SIGNATURE.

377
00:20:19,677 --> 00:20:22,596
BUT I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
IT WAS COMPLETELY INVISIBLE.

378
00:20:22,638 --> 00:20:24,515
HOW ON EARTH DID YOU KNOW
THAT A PHASE DISCRIMINATOR

379
00:20:24,557 --> 00:20:26,184
WOULD EXPOSE IT?

380
00:20:30,437 --> 00:20:32,065
ARCHER: IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN,
YOU'LL FIND

381
00:20:32,106 --> 00:20:35,484
THIS THING WAS DESIGNED
TO GENERATE A PLASMA STREAM.

382
00:20:35,526 --> 00:20:37,277
PUT A TEAM TOGETHER, TRIP.

383
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:39,030
I'LL NEED TWO QUANTUM BEACONS.

384
00:20:39,072 --> 00:20:40,907
THEY'LL HAVE TO BE
POSITRON-BASED

385
00:20:40,948 --> 00:20:42,742
AND HAVE AN OUTPUT
OF 200 GIGAWATTS APIECE.

386
00:20:42,783 --> 00:20:44,660
TUCKER: POSITRON-BASED, SIR?
ARCHER: JUST GET STARTED.

387
00:20:44,702 --> 00:20:46,662
I'LL BRING YOU THE SPECS
IN A FEW MINUTES.

388
00:20:46,704 --> 00:20:48,288
WE'RE GONNA NEED
OUR COM FREQUENCIES

389
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:49,749
ON THE FRITZ FOR A DAY OR SO.

390
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:51,458
ARCHER: SEE TO IT.
HOSHI: AYE, SIR.

391
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:54,545
ARCHER: PUT THE ARMORY
ON FULL ALERT.

392
00:20:54,587 --> 00:20:56,756
TURN THE SHIP AROUND, TRAVIS.

393
00:20:56,797 --> 00:20:59,050
WE'RE GOING BACK TO
THE PARAAGAN COLONY.

394
00:21:03,387 --> 00:21:05,264
WHAT ARE YOU ALL WAITING FOR?

395
00:21:07,641 --> 00:21:10,644
TUCKER: SIR?
ARCHER: IT WASN'T US, TRIP.

396
00:21:11,854 --> 00:21:14,690
WE DIDN'T DO IT.

397
00:21:14,732 --> 00:21:16,234
[TUCKER SIGHS]

398
00:21:22,782 --> 00:21:26,452
ARCHER: TAKE A LOOK AT THE
DISPERSAL CURVE HERE AND HERE.

399
00:21:26,493 --> 00:21:28,913
YOU'LL HAVE TO ISOLATE
THE SUBASSEMBLY TOLERANCES

400
00:21:28,955 --> 00:21:30,539
FROM THE EMITTER ALGORITHMS.

401
00:21:30,581 --> 00:21:33,167
TUCKER: WHOA. HOLD ON A MINUTE.

402
00:21:33,209 --> 00:21:36,045
YOU'RE SAYING THE ASSEMBLY'S
INDEPENDENT OF THE EMITTERS?

403
00:21:36,087 --> 00:21:37,671
EXACTLY.

404
00:21:37,713 --> 00:21:39,506
TUCKER: THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

405
00:21:39,548 --> 00:21:41,092
ARCHER: NOT IF YOU
GENERATE A STABLE FLUX

406
00:21:41,134 --> 00:21:43,010
BETWEEN THE POSITRON CONDUCTORS.

407
00:21:43,052 --> 00:21:44,804
THEN ALL YOU'LL HAVE TO DO

408
00:21:44,845 --> 00:21:48,224
IS RENORMALIZE
THE TERTIARY WAVE FUNCTIONS.

409
00:21:48,266 --> 00:21:50,143
TUCKER: WITH ALL
DUE RESPECT, SIR,

410
00:21:50,184 --> 00:21:51,769
THIS IS A LEVEL
OF QUANTUM ENGINEERING

411
00:21:51,811 --> 00:21:54,563
THAT'S BEYOND ANYTHING
I EVER LEARNED.

412
00:21:54,605 --> 00:21:56,565
HOW THE HELL DO YOU KNOW THIS?

413
00:21:56,607 --> 00:21:58,192
ARCHER: REMEMBER
CREWMAN DANIELS?

414
00:21:58,234 --> 00:21:59,986
TUCKER: YEAH.

415
00:22:00,027 --> 00:22:02,155
I SAW HIM GET VAPORIZED
BY OUR FRIEND SILIK.

416
00:22:02,196 --> 00:22:03,990
ARCHER: WELL, FOR
A CLOUD OF VAPOR,

417
00:22:04,031 --> 00:22:05,908
HE'S ONE WEALTH OF INFORMATION.

418
00:22:07,243 --> 00:22:09,996
I JUST SPENT TWO HOURS WITH HIM.

419
00:22:10,037 --> 00:22:11,371
TUCKER: HE'S ON "ENTERPRISE"?

420
00:22:12,665 --> 00:22:15,001
NOT EXACTLY.

421
00:22:15,042 --> 00:22:16,752
LISTEN, I'LL EXPLAIN LATER.

422
00:22:16,794 --> 00:22:20,214
RIGHT NOW WE'VE GOT TO GET BACK
TO BUILDING THESE BEACONS.

423
00:22:20,256 --> 00:22:22,300
TUCKER: WHATEVER YOU SAY.

424
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:23,968
ARCHER:
THE CIRCUITRY IN THERE

425
00:22:24,010 --> 00:22:26,137
ISN'T COMPATIBLE
WITH OUR TECHNOLOGY.

426
00:22:26,179 --> 00:22:28,055
WE'LL HAVE TO CREATE
AN INTERFACE.

427
00:22:28,097 --> 00:22:29,974
HOSHI: WHAT FOR?

428
00:22:30,016 --> 00:22:31,642
ARCHER: WE'RE GOING
TO BE RETRIEVING

429
00:22:31,684 --> 00:22:33,351
SOME SULIBAN DATA DISCS.

430
00:22:33,393 --> 00:22:35,646
I HAVE NO DOUBT YOU'LL BE ABLE
TO HANDLE THE CONTENT.

431
00:22:35,688 --> 00:22:37,564
BUT BEFORE YOU CAN DO THAT,

432
00:22:37,606 --> 00:22:40,109
WE'LL HAVE TO FIND A WAY
TO ACCESS THE DATA.

433
00:22:40,151 --> 00:22:42,987
T'POL: AND DANIELS CLAIMS
THIS IS SULIBAN TECHNOLOGY?

434
00:22:43,029 --> 00:22:45,447
ARCHER: EVERYTHING HE'S TOLD ME
HAS CHECKED OUT SO FAR.

435
00:22:45,489 --> 00:22:47,033
I HAVE NO REASON
TO DOUBT HIM ON THIS.

436
00:22:47,074 --> 00:22:48,951
HOSHI: WE'LL DO
OUR BEST, CAPTAIN.

437
00:22:50,203 --> 00:22:52,412
T'POL: CAPTAIN.

438
00:22:52,454 --> 00:22:54,332
THE VULCAN SHIP
WE WERE HEADED FOR--

439
00:22:54,372 --> 00:22:57,668
IT'S NO DOUBT DETECTED
WE'VE ALTERED COURSE.

440
00:22:57,710 --> 00:22:59,837
HAVE THEY TRIED TO HAIL US?

441
00:22:59,879 --> 00:23:02,840
HOSHI: I WOULDN'T KNOW, SIR.
OUR COM IS ON THE FRITZ.

442
00:23:07,887 --> 00:23:10,681
REED: WHY DID DANIELS LEAVE IT
IN HIS QUARTERS?

443
00:23:10,723 --> 00:23:12,183
ARCHER: I DON'T RECALL
HIM HAVING MUCH TIME TO PACK

444
00:23:12,225 --> 00:23:13,433
BEFORE HE LEFT.

445
00:23:13,475 --> 00:23:15,644
REED: NO.
WELL, IF IT IS THERE

446
00:23:15,686 --> 00:23:17,355
AND IT CONTAINS
WHAT HE SAID IT DOES,

447
00:23:17,395 --> 00:23:20,233
IT COULD BE INVALUABLE
TO STARFLEET.

448
00:23:20,274 --> 00:23:22,068
ARCHER: I GAVE DANIELS
MY WORD, MALCOLM.

449
00:23:22,109 --> 00:23:24,486
WE DOWNLOAD THE SCHEMATICS
FOR THE SULIBAN STEALTH CRUISER,

450
00:23:24,528 --> 00:23:26,239
NOTHING ELSE.

451
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:28,032
REED: PITY.

452
00:23:28,074 --> 00:23:30,159
ASSUMING HE'S RIGHT AND
WE MANAGE TO FIND THE CRUISER,

453
00:23:30,201 --> 00:23:32,619
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK
THE SULIBAN WON'T COME AFTER US?

454
00:23:32,661 --> 00:23:34,788
ARCHER: JUST LIKE THOSE
OLD BIBLE MOVIES, MALCOLM--

455
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:36,582
"IT WASN'T WRITTEN."

456
00:24:00,564 --> 00:24:03,234
ARCHER: SO FAR, DANIELS
IS BATTING 1.000.

457
00:24:16,163 --> 00:24:18,749
REED: WAIT A MINUTE.
YOU SEE THAT?

458
00:24:18,791 --> 00:24:20,584
THEY'VE GOT SCHEMATICS

459
00:24:20,626 --> 00:24:22,502
ON HALF A DOZEN
DIFFERENT KLINGON SHIPS.

460
00:24:22,544 --> 00:24:24,838
ARCHER: THE STEALTH CRUISER,
LIEUTENANT. NOTHING ELSE.

461
00:24:30,219 --> 00:24:33,264
REED: THERE. THERE IT IS.

462
00:24:43,023 --> 00:24:45,359
ARCHER: TRIP?

463
00:24:45,401 --> 00:24:47,485
TUCKER: I FEEL LIKE A CHEF
WHO'S JUST MADE A MEAL

464
00:24:47,527 --> 00:24:49,071
WITH INGREDIENTS
HE'S NEVER TASTED.

465
00:24:49,113 --> 00:24:50,614
ARCHER: YOU FOLLOW
THE INSTRUCTIONS?

466
00:24:50,656 --> 00:24:52,116
TUCKER: TO THE LETTER.

467
00:24:52,158 --> 00:24:55,202
T'POL: BRIDGE TO CAPTAIN ARCHER.
ARCHER: GO AHEAD.

468
00:24:55,244 --> 00:24:57,163
T'POL: WE'RE
APPROACHING THE COLONY.

469
00:24:57,204 --> 00:24:59,539
ARCHER: HAVE MR. MAYWEATHER
LOCATE A BINARY SYSTEM

470
00:24:59,581 --> 00:25:01,959
2.5 LIGHT-YEARS AWAY
AND SET A COURSE.

471
00:25:02,001 --> 00:25:03,710
T'POL: UNDERSTOOD.

472
00:25:03,752 --> 00:25:06,588
ARCHER: LET'S GET THESE MOUNTED

473
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:12,886
ARCHER:
HEAD FOR THE SMALLER STAR,

474
00:25:12,928 --> 00:25:14,805
THEN THE INNER MOON
OF THE SECOND PLANET.

475
00:25:14,847 --> 00:25:16,390
BRIDGE TO ARMORY.

476
00:25:16,432 --> 00:25:18,017
REED HERE.

477
00:25:18,058 --> 00:25:20,019

00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:22,146
REED: AYE, SIR.
ARCHER: STAND BY.

480
00:25:30,946 --> 00:25:33,991
IF THIS GOES WELL,
I SHOULDN'T BE LONG.

481
00:25:34,033 --> 00:25:35,909
LOWER THE BEACONS.

482
00:25:45,336 --> 00:25:49,840
MODIFY THE VIEWSCREEN.
BRING UP THESE COORDINATES.

483
00:25:49,882 --> 00:25:52,426
FULL MAGNIFICATION.

484
00:25:52,468 --> 00:25:54,720
ACTIVATE THE BEACONS.

485
00:26:01,727 --> 00:26:04,188
ARCHER: RIGHT WHERE
THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE.

486
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:05,981
HOSHI: AREN'T WE IN RANGE
OF THEIR SENSORS, SIR?

487
00:26:06,023 --> 00:26:07,858
ARCHER: THEY CAN SEE US.

488
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:10,152
BUT THEY HAVE NO IDEA
WE CAN SEE THROUGH THEIR CLOAK.

489
00:26:12,071 --> 00:26:14,365
JUST KEEP ON
THE SAME COURSE, TRAVIS.

490
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:19,286
MALCOLM.

THE CLOSER, THE BETTER, SIR.

492
00:26:28,421 --> 00:26:30,297

ARCHER: NOW, MR. REED!

494
00:26:39,765 --> 00:26:41,641

REED: SHE'S ALL YOURS,
CAPTAIN. GOOD LUCK.

501
00:27:03,122 --> 00:27:05,124

SHOULD HAVE SEALED OFF

502
00:27:05,165 --> 00:27:06,708
THE TWO LOWER DECKS.

503
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:08,626

00:40:11,243 --> 00:40:13,078
GAME?

674
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:16,455
<i>HE HAS 30 SECONDS LEFT.</i>
<i>DID HE THINK I WASN'T SERIOUS?</i>

675
00:40:21,669 --> 00:40:24,630
THE TURBOLIFT'S ON "E" DECK.
IT'S EMPTY.

676
00:40:24,672 --> 00:40:26,258
T'POL: WHERE IS HE?

677
00:40:26,299 --> 00:40:29,427
I'M NOT READING HIS BIO-SIGNS.

678
00:40:29,468 --> 00:40:31,012
HE MUST BE ON THE SULIBAN SHIP.

679
00:40:38,436 --> 00:40:41,689
T'POL: CAPTAIN ARCHER IS
NO LONGER ABOARD "ENTERPRISE."

680
00:40:41,731 --> 00:40:44,192
PERHAPS YOU SHOULD CHECK WITH
THE VESSEL YOU SENT FOR HIM.

681
00:40:44,234 --> 00:40:47,779
<i>I THOUGHT HE WAS SMARTER</i>
<i>THAN THIS.</i>

682
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:49,614
<i>HE COULD HAVE SAVED</i>
<i>ALL YOUR LIVES.</i>

683
00:40:49,655 --> 00:40:51,366
<i>WHAT A WASTE.</i>

684
00:40:53,034 --> 00:40:55,120
THE DOCKED SHIP IS MOVING AWAY.

685
00:40:56,413 --> 00:40:58,039
IT'S TARGETING OUR WARP CORE.

686
00:41:00,292 --> 00:41:02,252
THEY'RE ALL TARGETING
THE WARP CORE.

687
00:41:36,202 --> 00:41:38,579
DANIELS: 10 MINUTES AGO,
THAT VISTA WAS MORE BEAUTIFUL

688
00:41:38,621 --> 00:41:40,290
THAN ANYTHING YOU COULD IMAGINE.

689
00:41:43,668 --> 00:41:45,211
ARCHER: WHERE AM I?

690
00:41:46,963 --> 00:41:52,760
I-I HAD BREAKFAST IN THAT ROOM
LESS THAN HALF AN HOUR AGO.

691
00:41:52,802 --> 00:41:55,930
THEN I WAS INSTRUCTED
TO BRING YOU HERE.

692
00:41:55,972 --> 00:41:58,308
THEY TOLD ME THAT THE TIMELINE
WOULDN'T BE SAFE

693
00:41:58,350 --> 00:42:00,185
IF YOU BOARDED
THAT SULIBAN SHIP.

694
00:42:00,226 --> 00:42:03,146
SOMEONE WAS VERY MISTAKEN.

695
00:42:03,188 --> 00:42:05,357
ARCHER: WHERE IS HERE?

696
00:42:05,398 --> 00:42:07,359
YOU'RE IN THE 31st CENTURY,
CAPTAIN.

697
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:09,486
OR WHAT'S LEFT OF IT.

698
00:42:12,113 --> 00:42:14,157
YOU SAID THE SULIBAN
WOULDN'T FOLLOW US,

699
00:42:14,199 --> 00:42:16,617
THAT WE'D MAKE IT SAFELY
TO THE VULCAN SHIP.

700
00:42:16,659 --> 00:42:18,370
DANIELS: AS FAR AS I WAS TOLD,

701
00:42:18,411 --> 00:42:20,205
THAT WAS EXACTLY WHAT
WAS SUPPOSED TO OCCUR.

702
00:42:20,246 --> 00:42:22,748
ARCHER: SO YOU'RE TELLING ME
THIS JUST HAPPENED?

703
00:42:22,790 --> 00:42:24,959
IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE
IT JUST HAPPENED.

704
00:42:26,461 --> 00:42:28,213
NO.

705
00:42:28,254 --> 00:42:32,133
IT LOOKS LIKE IT HAPPENED
A LONG TIME AGO.

706
00:42:32,175 --> 00:42:37,222
ARCHER: IF BRINGING ME HERE
CAUSED THIS, THEN SEND ME BACK.

707
00:42:37,263 --> 00:42:40,016
I'LL TAKE MY CHANCES WITH SILIK.

708
00:42:40,058 --> 00:42:42,060
DANIELS: Y-YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

709
00:42:42,101 --> 00:42:47,065
ALL OUR EQUIPMENT--
THE TIME PORTALS--

710
00:42:47,106 --> 00:42:49,401
HAVE BEEN DESTROYED.

711
00:42:49,442 --> 00:42:51,819
EVERYTHING'S BEEN DESTROYED.

712
00:42:51,861 --> 00:42:54,155
THERE'S NO WAY TO SEND YOU BACK.
