INCAPACITATED FOR SEVEN DAYS.

348
00:20:14,088 --> 00:20:15,589
AND DURING THAT TIME,

349
00:20:15,589 --> 00:20:18,425
SIM HAS PRACTICALLY BECOME
A MEMBER OF THE CREW.

350
00:20:18,425 --> 00:20:20,011
I'VE ASSIGNED HIM
TO ENGINEERING,

351
00:20:20,011 --> 00:20:21,512
WHERE HE'S BEEN ASSISTING T'POL

352
00:20:21,512 --> 00:20:24,264
IN THE ONGOING EFFORT
TO REPAIR THE ENGINES.

353
00:20:34,525 --> 00:20:35,860

354
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:37,361
FOR THE PRIMARY PORT BYPASS.

355
00:20:37,361 --> 00:20:40,531
THINK I MADE SOME PROGRESS.

356
00:20:40,531 --> 00:20:42,491
THIS LOOKS PROMISING.

357
00:20:44,326 --> 00:20:46,537
THEY'RE SHOWING
"A NIGHT AT THE OPERA" TONIGHT.

358
00:20:46,537 --> 00:20:47,955
MARX BROTHERS.

359
00:20:47,955 --> 00:20:49,582
I WAS WONDERING
IF YOU'RE PLANNING TO GO.

360
00:20:49,582 --> 00:20:52,292
I'LL BE REVIEWING
THE FIELD-COIL EQUATIONS.

361
00:20:52,292 --> 00:20:56,047
THEY NEED TO BE FINISHED IN TIME
FOR TOMORROW'S REACTOR TEST.

362
00:20:56,047 --> 00:20:58,257
OH.

363
00:20:58,257 --> 00:20:59,383
WELL, WHAT ABOUT DINNER?

364
00:20:59,383 --> 00:21:01,010
YOU WANT TO GRAB A BITE?

365
00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:02,636
I APPRECIATE THE OFFER,

366
00:21:02,636 --> 00:21:05,472
BUT I'M AFRAID I HAVE TO WORK
LATE INTO THE EVENING.

368

00:21:09,435 --> 00:21:11,187
I'D LIKE YOU TO ASSIST HER.

370
00:21:11,187 --> 00:21:12,646
YES, MA'AM.

371
00:21:14,523 --> 00:21:17,944
IT'S BECAUSE I'M DIFFERENT,
ISN'T IT?

372
00:21:17,944 --> 00:21:20,196
THE REASON YOU DON'T WANT TO DO
ANYTHING WITH ME.

373
00:21:21,697 --> 00:21:25,325
I GUESS IT MUST BE WEIRD
BEING WITH SOMEONE LIKE ME.

374
00:21:26,535 --> 00:21:28,788
FIVE DAYS AGO
I WAS WEARING DIAPERS.

375
00:21:28,788 --> 00:21:32,416
I SIMPLY BELIEVE THAT
OUR ATTENTION SHOULD BE FOCUSED

376
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:34,585
ON THE SHIP'S ENGINES.

377
00:21:34,585 --> 00:21:38,338
AT LEAST UNTIL THE CURRENT
SITUATION IS RESOLVED.

378
00:21:38,338 --> 00:21:39,715
I PROBABLY WON'T BE AROUND

379
00:21:39,715 --> 00:21:42,384
AFTER THE CURRENT SITUATION
IS RESOLVED.

TO MY READY ROOM?

383
00:21:54,897 --> 00:21:56,398
ON MY WAY.

384
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:04,073

IN TWO WEEKS.

385
00:22:04,073 --> 00:22:07,118
I'M AFRAID
THAT WON'T BE SOON ENOUGH.

386
00:22:07,118 --> 00:22:09,578
-SIR, I --
-ACCORDING TO MALCOLM...

387
00:22:09,578 --> 00:22:11,038
THE ACCUMULATION ON THE HULL

388
00:22:11,038 --> 00:22:14,167
IS GENERATING
A DIAMAGNETIC FIELD.

389
00:22:14,167 --> 00:22:16,919
IT'S HAVING A DAMPENING EFFECT.

390
00:22:16,919 --> 00:22:19,297
THE MORE
THE PARTICULATE BUILDS UP,

391
00:22:19,297 --> 00:22:21,090
THE MORE POWERFUL
THE FIELD BECOMES.

392
00:22:21,090 --> 00:22:23,926
IN ANOTHER FOUR DAYS,
EVERY SYSTEM ON THE SHIP

393
00:22:23,926 --> 00:22:26,386
WILL BE OFF-LINE.

394
00:22:26,386 --> 00:22:31,100
IF WE DON'T MAKE IT OUT OF HERE
BY THEN, WE NEVER WILL.

395

KEY LIME PIE.

396
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:42,320
I SUDDENLY REALIZED
IT WAS MY FAVORITE DESSERT.

397
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:43,654
NOW I KNOW WHY.

398
00:22:45,239 --> 00:22:48,075
DO THESE MEMORIES
JUST COME TO YOU?

399
00:22:48,075 --> 00:22:51,996
WELL, THE OLDER I GET,
THE MORE I REMEMBER.

400
00:22:51,996 --> 00:22:55,373
IT'S LIKE I'VE LIVED
THIS WHOLE OTHER LIFE.

401
00:22:55,373 --> 00:22:57,168
CAN'T EXPLAIN IT.

402
00:22:57,168 --> 00:22:59,795
I CAN'T IMAGINE IT.

403
00:22:59,795 --> 00:23:01,214
YOU WANTED TO ASK ME
ABOUT SOMETHING.

404
00:23:01,214 --> 00:23:04,050
MM.
YEAH, I DID.

405
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:06,260
DO YOU THINK IT'S POSSIBLE
TO REDIRECT THE PHASE CANNONS

406
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:08,512
SO THEY CAN FIRE BACK
ONTO THE HULL?

407
00:23:08,512 --> 00:23:10,348
I SUPPOSE SO.
WHY?

408
00:23:10,348 --> 00:23:12,808
WELL, I WANT TO TRY AND BLAST
OFF ENOUGH OF THAT PARTICULATE

409
00:23:12,808 --> 00:23:14,518
SO WE CAN OPEN UP
THE LAUNCH BAY DOORS.

410
00:23:14,518 --> 00:23:16,937
IS SOMEONE PLANNING
ON GOING SOMEWHERE?

411
00:23:16,937 --> 00:23:19,439
ALL WE NEED TO DO
IS BUILD UP ENOUGH MOMENTUM

412
00:23:19,439 --> 00:23:20,900
TO GET THE SHIP
OUT OF HERE, RIGHT?

413
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:22,318
RIGHT.

414
00:23:22,318 --> 00:23:24,362
WELL, WE'VE GOT

IF WE STRING
A COUPLE OF GRAPPLER LINES

417
00:23:28,032 --> 00:23:30,243
BETWEEN THE SHUTTLEPODS
AND THE SHIP,

418
00:23:30,243 --> 00:23:32,578
WE CAN TOW OURSELVES CLEAR.

419
00:23:32,578 --> 00:23:35,455
THE SHUTTLEPODS DON'T GENERATE
THAT KIND OF THRUST.

420
00:23:35,455 --> 00:23:36,916
WE'D NEVER BUILD UP
ENOUGH MOMENTUM

421
00:23:36,916 --> 00:23:38,751
TO GET CLEAR
OF THE FIELD IN TIME.

422
00:23:38,751 --> 00:23:40,711
LEAVE THAT TO ME.

423
00:23:44,548 --> 00:23:46,508
[ DOOR CHIMES ]

424
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:57,895
CAN I COME IN?

425
00:24:01,023 --> 00:24:04,693
DID YOU HAVE A CHANCE
TO LOOK AT MY CALCULATIONS?

426
00:24:04,693 --> 00:24:06,653
I REVIEWED THEM THOROUGHLY.

427
00:24:06,653 --> 00:24:08,072
AND?

428
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:11,784
A FUSION OVERBURN
HAS NEVER BEEN ATTEMPTED

429
00:24:11,784 --> 00:24:13,660
WITH A SHUTTLEPOD ENGINE.

430
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:15,246
THAT DOESN'T MEAN IT WON'T WORK.

431
00:24:15,246 --> 00:24:17,415
I AGREE.

432
00:24:17,415 --> 00:24:19,959
DESPITE THE RISKS, I BELIEVE
IT'S OUR BEST OPTION.

433
00:24:19,959 --> 00:24:24,088
SO YOU'RE GONNA RECOMMEND
THE PLAN TO THE CAPTAIN?

434
00:24:24,088 --> 00:24:25,839
I ALREADY HAVE.

435
00:24:28,342 --> 00:24:29,885
WAS THERE SOMETHING ELSE?

436
00:24:33,097 --> 00:24:36,225
YOU AND TRIP USED TO SPEND
A LOT OF TIME HERE TOGETHER.

437
00:24:36,225 --> 00:24:37,977
I WAS INSTRUCTING HIM
IN THE PRACTICE

438
00:24:37,977 --> 00:24:39,561
OF VULCAN NEUROPRESSURE.

439
00:24:39,561 --> 00:24:41,981
I REMEMBER.

440
00:24:43,441 --> 00:24:45,901
WE WERE LYING RIGHT THERE,

441
00:24:45,901 --> 00:24:48,862
WORKING THE NEURAL NODES
ON EACH OTHER'S FEET,

442
00:24:48,862 --> 00:24:51,282
TALKING ABOUT THE WARP ENGINES.

443
00:24:51,282 --> 00:24:53,491
HOW I WAS HOPING TO MODIFY THEM.

444
00:24:53,491 --> 00:24:56,703
HOW COMMANDER TUCKER
WAS HOPING TO MODIFY THEM.

445
00:24:56,703 --> 00:24:58,580
RIGHT.

446
00:24:58,580 --> 00:24:59,832
COMMANDER TUCKER.

447
00:25:01,083 --> 00:25:02,626
YOU KNOW, HE WAS REALLY
STARTING TO ENJOY

448
00:25:02,626 --> 00:25:03,752
THOSE SESSIONS WITH YOU.

449
00:25:03,752 --> 00:25:06,255
THEY WERE HELPING HIM SLEEP.

450
00:25:06,255 --> 00:25:08,632
I'M NOT SURE
THAT'S THE ONLY REASON.

451
00:25:09,633 --> 00:25:10,759
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

452
00:25:14,096 --> 00:25:17,475
WAS THERE EVER ANYTHING
BETWEEN YOU AND TRIP?

453
00:25:19,018 --> 00:25:23,397
IF YOU'RE REFERRING TO
A ROMANTIC RELATIONSHIP, NO.

454
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:26,650
THE REASON I ASK IS...

455
00:25:29,069 --> 00:25:30,612
WELL...

456
00:25:33,157 --> 00:25:36,494
YOU'RE ALL I THINK ABOUT,
IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

457
00:25:36,494 --> 00:25:38,078
AND I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT
AN ADOLESCENT CRUSH.

458
00:25:38,078 --> 00:25:42,208
THAT WAS...
WELL, THAT WAS TWO DAYS AGO.

459
00:25:44,502 --> 00:25:47,629
THIS IS MUCH MORE SERIOUS,
THE WAY I FEEL ABOUT YOU.

460
00:25:49,465 --> 00:25:51,509
ANYWAY...

461
00:25:51,509 --> 00:25:53,052
WHAT'S DRIVING ME CRAZY

462
00:25:53,052 --> 00:25:57,014
IS I DON'T KNOW
IF THESE FEELINGS ARE MINE...

463
00:25:57,014 --> 00:25:58,182
OR HIS.

464
00:25:59,599 --> 00:26:01,185
I CAN'T ANSWER THAT.

465
00:26:03,437 --> 00:26:05,772
I DIDN'T MEAN TO MAKE YOU
FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE.

466
00:26:05,772 --> 00:26:07,816
I'M NOT UNCOMFORTABLE.

467
00:26:09,276 --> 00:26:12,530
I JUST THOUGHT
I SHOULD TELL YOU THIS.

468
00:26:12,530 --> 00:26:14,407
WHILE I STILL HAD THE CHANCE.

469
00:26:17,284 --> 00:26:18,660

I WANT TO PILOT

472
00:26:23,499 --> 00:26:25,918
-THAT'S OUT OF THE QUESTION.
-IT'S<i> MY</i> PLAN.

473
00:26:25,918 --> 00:26:27,711
I THINK I SHOULD HAVE A SAY
IN HOW IT'S IMPLEMENTED.

474
00:26:27,711 --> 00:26:30,464
THIS IS A DANGEROUS PROCEDURE.

475
00:26:30,464 --> 00:26:31,965
YOU'VE NEVER FLOWN
A SHUTTLEPOD BEFORE.

476
00:26:31,965 --> 00:26:33,384
YES, I HAVE.

477
00:26:33,384 --> 00:26:35,677
TRIP HAS THOUSANDS OF HOURS
OF FLYING TIME,

478
00:26:35,677 --> 00:26:36,845
AND I HAVE HIS MEMORIES.

479
00:26:36,845 --> 00:26:38,305
I CAN'T JEOPARDIZE THIS SHIP

480
00:26:38,305 --> 00:26:40,766
ON THE STRENGTH
OF THOSE MEMORIES.

481
00:26:42,268 --> 00:26:46,813

482
00:26:48,023 --> 00:26:49,483

T'POL WILL ASSIST YOU.

484
00:26:51,193 --> 00:26:54,447
YOU'RE WORRIED SOMETHING
WILL HAPPEN TO ME, AREN'T YOU?

485
00:26:56,990 --> 00:26:58,200
YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE I'M AROUND

486
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:00,494
BECAUSE YOU NEED
PART OF MY BRAIN.

487
00:27:00,494 --> 00:27:02,413
YEAH.

488
00:27:02,413 --> 00:27:04,164

IS THAT THIS PLAN WORK.

491

WHETHER TRIP SURVIVES OR NOT.
