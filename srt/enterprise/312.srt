1
00:00:10,301 --> 00:00:12,512
It's identical to the other two.

2
00:00:12,595 --> 00:00:15,015
Even the smallest features
are exactly the same.

3
00:00:15,098 --> 00:00:17,642
Like they came off an assembly line.

4
00:00:17,726 --> 00:00:19,853
I'd love to see the factory
that made these.

5
00:00:21,896 --> 00:00:24,149
Well, that's the last sensor sweep.

6
00:00:24,232 --> 00:00:27,152
Should give T'Pol
plenty to chew on for a while.

7
00:00:34,868 --> 00:00:37,037
-( beeping )
-Power fluctuations.

8
00:00:45,628 --> 00:00:47,464
I think we're getting the hang of this.

9
00:00:47,547 --> 00:00:50,258
We're coming up on the outer edge
of the cloaking barrier.

10
00:00:55,346 --> 00:00:57,265
They're emerging.

11
00:00:57,348 --> 00:00:59,934
Heading back to their ship.

12
00:01:00,018 --> 00:01:01,519
Visual.

13
00:01:06,191 --> 00:01:08,985
I want to know
what kind of armaments they're carrying.

14
00:01:10,487 --> 00:01:12,322
We may have found what we're looking for.

00:01:19,829 --> 00:01:22,373

35
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:42,620
This new data should help us map
the anomalies more accurately.

36
00:02:42,704 --> 00:02:44,247
I should also be able to calculate

37
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:46,666
the exact number of spheres
in the expanse.

38
00:02:46,749 --> 00:02:49,752
-Any new theories on their purpose?
-Not yet.

39
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:51,754
-( beeps )
-MALCOLM: <i>Bridge to Captain Archer.</i>

40
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,383
{\an8}-( beep )
-Archer here.

41
00:02:55,466 --> 00:02:57,719
{\an8}<i>We've picked up a vessel </i>
<i>approaching at impulse.</i>

42
00:02:57,802 --> 00:02:59,762
{\an8}<i>They're transmitting a distress signal.</i>

43
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,682
{\an8}( beeping )

44
00:03:02,765 --> 00:03:04,601
{\an8}They're trapped in a cluster of anomalies.

45
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:06,436
{\an8}They've taken engine damage.

46
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:07,770
{\an8}Let's see them.

47
00:03:11,149 --> 00:03:12,650
{\an8}Twenty-three bio-signs.

48
00:03:12,734 --> 00:03:13,735
{\an8}Hail them.

49
00:03:15,987 --> 00:03:19,115
{\an8}This is captain Jonathan Archer
of the starship <i>Enterprise.</i>

50
00:03:19,198 --> 00:03:20,825
{\an8}Can we assist you?

51
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:23,661
{\an8}MAN: Enterprise,
<i>we've suffered heavy damage.</i>

52
00:03:23,745 --> 00:03:26,623
{\an8}<i>Our engines are inoperative.</i>
<i>Our life-support system is failing.</i>

53
00:03:26,706 --> 00:03:28,875
{\an8}<i>Please assist us.</i>

54
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:30,501
{\an8}What kind of weapons do they have?

55
00:03:30,585 --> 00:03:32,128
{\an8}Minimal.

56
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:36,299
{\an8}Can you get us through the anomalies?

57
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:38,760
{\an8}I believe I can plot a safe course.

58
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,388
{\an8}Full impulse.

59
00:03:49,354 --> 00:03:51,814
{\an8}-( beeping )
-Their life-support system has failed.

60
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:54,359
{\an8}Take full security precautions.

61
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:57,987
{\an8}Make sure none of them are armed.

62
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:05,161
{\an8}You'll be fine. Excuse me for one moment.

63
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:07,080
{\an8}Thank you, Doctor.

64
00:04:07,163 --> 00:04:08,998
{\an8}How are they?

65
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:11,626
{\an8}I'm unable to perform detailed bio-scans.

66
00:04:11,709 --> 00:04:12,752
{\an8}Why?

67
00:04:12,835 --> 00:04:15,463
{\an8}They have an aversion
to any kind of invasive medical care.

68
00:04:15,546 --> 00:04:18,174
{\an8}For religious reasons.

69
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:21,844
{\an8}However, I have managed to ascertain
that aside from some minor injuries

70
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:24,430
{\an8}and one slight case of malnutrition,

71
00:04:24,514 --> 00:04:26,557
{\an8}they appear to be fine.

72
00:04:26,641 --> 00:04:28,268
{\an8}ARCHER: They're no strangers to anomalies.

73
00:04:28,351 --> 00:04:30,311
{\an8}That looks like an old scar.

74
00:04:30,395 --> 00:04:32,814
{\an8}I found similar injuries on four others.

75
00:04:32,897 --> 00:04:36,567
{\an8}Apparently they've been in the vicinity
of the sphere for several months.

76
00:04:36,651 --> 00:04:38,653
{\an8}Which one's the captain?

77
00:04:38,736 --> 00:04:41,322
{\an8}He prefers the term Pri'Nam.

78
00:04:41,406 --> 00:04:43,741
A religious designation.

79
00:04:49,372 --> 00:04:50,707
I'm Captain Archer.

80
00:04:51,499 --> 00:04:53,209
Welcome aboard.

81
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:55,336
My name is D'Jamat.

82
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:57,755
I can't express how grateful we are.

83
00:04:57,839 --> 00:04:59,299
You saved our lives.

84
00:04:59,382 --> 00:05:01,968
I understand you've been in
this region for quite some time.

85
00:05:02,051 --> 00:05:05,013
Yes, we're on a pilgrimage
to the 12th sphere.

86
00:05:05,096 --> 00:05:07,223
It's taken us a year to make the journey.

87
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:10,435
Your ship's in pretty rough shape.
My engineer's taking a look at it.

88
00:05:10,727 --> 00:05:13,313
Well, it's an old vessel, but sturdy.

89
00:05:13,396 --> 00:05:17,817
Unfortunately we are better at prayer
than we are at space travel.

90
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:20,945
Maybe there's some information
about the spheres we can share.

91
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:22,739
If you're feeling up to it,

92
00:05:22,822 --> 00:05:25,783
I'd like you to have dinner with me
and my science officer tonight.

93
00:05:26,534 --> 00:05:29,537
I'd be honored to accept
your hospitality, Captain.

94
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:35,376
Our homeworld is called Triannon.

95
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:39,047
It's 6.3 light-years from here,
in the Muratas star cluster.

96
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:43,092
-Have you heard of it?
-Doesn't ring a bell.

97
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:45,344
We're new to the expanse.

98
00:05:45,928 --> 00:05:47,305
The expanse?

99
00:05:48,598 --> 00:05:50,725
You mean the Chosen Realm.

100
00:05:51,976 --> 00:05:54,520
I think we're talking
about the same thing.

101
00:05:54,604 --> 00:05:58,107
We're here to learn everything we can
about a species you may have run into.

102
00:05:58,191 --> 00:05:59,192
The Xindi.

103
00:06:00,651 --> 00:06:02,361
I'm not familiar with them.

104
00:06:02,445 --> 00:06:07,283
We place very little emphasis
on meeting other life-forms.

105
00:06:07,366 --> 00:06:12,455
Space travel for us is merely a means
to bring us closer to the spheres.

106
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:14,665
You've studied them for some time?

107
00:06:14,749 --> 00:06:18,252
We're not here to study the spheres.
We're here to venerate them.

108
00:06:19,003 --> 00:06:21,923
We believe that it is
through prayer and meditation

109
00:06:22,006 --> 00:06:24,133
that the Makers become manifest.

110
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:27,303
-The Makers?
-The creator of the spheres.

111
00:06:27,929 --> 00:06:30,056
I've felt their presence here.

112
00:06:35,686 --> 00:06:37,688
You're referring to spatial anomalies.

113
00:06:38,272 --> 00:06:39,732
The Maker's Breath.

114
00:06:39,816 --> 00:06:42,110
It reshapes reality,

115
00:06:42,193 --> 00:06:46,030
allows ordinary men
a glimpse of the divine.

116
00:06:46,114 --> 00:06:48,366
That "Breath" nearly destroyed your ship.

117
00:06:48,449 --> 00:06:50,743
Well, we became careless.

118
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:54,372
It's easy to do when you're
in the presence of a sphere.

119
00:06:54,455 --> 00:06:57,416
They're certainly impressive.

120
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,127
We've found three of them so far.

121
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:02,588
Oh, you're fortunate
to have such a fast ship.

122
00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:06,634
I regret that I'll die having seen
only one of the many thousands of spheres.

123
00:07:07,051 --> 00:07:11,431
Actually, we've determined
that there are 59 spheres in the expanse.

124
00:07:11,514 --> 00:07:13,349
I think your estimates are a bit low.

125
00:07:13,724 --> 00:07:15,143
That's doubtful.

126
00:07:15,893 --> 00:07:17,645
With the Makers, there is no doubt.

127
00:07:18,229 --> 00:07:20,982
Doubt is the basis
of all scientific progress.

128
00:07:21,065 --> 00:07:24,527
Scientific progress
has led many people astray.

129
00:07:24,986 --> 00:07:29,407
Perhaps this is a subject
we should discuss some other time.

130
00:07:32,243 --> 00:07:33,744
I agree, Captain.

131
00:07:34,537 --> 00:07:36,622
You'll be glad to know
my engineer believes

132
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:38,624
that he can repair
the damage to your vessel.

133
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:41,544
He thinks it shouldn't take
more than a couple of days.

134
00:07:41,627 --> 00:07:43,838
That is good news.

135
00:07:43,921 --> 00:07:49,177
I certainly hope that we'll have
the opportunity to repay your kindness.

136
00:07:57,226 --> 00:08:01,105
-May I help you?
-I'd like to speak with you.

137
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:03,691
What is it?

138
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:06,903
Are you feeling ill?

139
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:11,115
I wanted to ask you
about a certain procedure.

140
00:08:11,949 --> 00:08:13,409
I'm sorry.

141
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:16,120
It's very difficult for me to talk about.

142
00:08:16,204 --> 00:08:18,581
Why don't you, uh, have a seat, hmm?

143
00:08:20,249 --> 00:08:22,126
I was about to make some Janaran tea.

144
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:25,838
-Would you like some?
-Yes. Thank you.

145
00:08:33,221 --> 00:08:35,515
-Is everyone in place?
-Yes.

146
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:37,725
They're just waiting for your signal.

147
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:41,896
You sound hesitant.

148
00:08:43,648 --> 00:08:45,525
I am sorry, Pri'Nam, but...

149
00:08:45,608 --> 00:08:48,194
Are you certain
this is the right thing to do?

150
00:08:50,863 --> 00:08:54,116
Do you think this ship
just came to us by coincidence?

151
00:08:55,076 --> 00:08:58,287
This encounter was clearly
ordained by the Makers.

152
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:00,873
But these people
risked their lives to save us.

153
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:03,543
They desecrated a sphere.

154
00:09:06,754 --> 00:09:08,381
What we are about to do

155
00:09:08,464 --> 00:09:11,342
is not just for our salvation
but for theirs as well.

156
00:09:12,969 --> 00:09:14,637
I know it can be difficult.

157
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,723
We've been away from home for a long time.

158
00:09:18,099 --> 00:09:22,520
But we have been given the means
to end the bloodshed once and for all.

159
00:09:22,603 --> 00:09:25,106
Don't lose your faith now, Yarrick.

160
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:27,441
Never, Pri'Nam.

161
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:35,992
They believe that godlike beings
they call the Makers

162
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:38,703
created the spheres a thousand years ago.

163
00:09:38,786 --> 00:09:42,123
We have determined that the spheres
are nearly a thousand years old.

164
00:09:42,206 --> 00:09:45,626
Well, they also believe that
the Makers are using the spheres

165
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:48,087
to reshape the expanse,

166
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:51,299
creating a paradise for when they return.

167
00:09:51,382 --> 00:09:53,384
Mythology often has a basis in fact.

168
00:09:53,467 --> 00:09:55,011
( door chimes )

169
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:56,345
Come in.

170
00:09:58,347 --> 00:10:00,641
-Am I disturbing you?
-Not at all.

171
00:10:00,725 --> 00:10:02,101
Excuse me.

172
00:10:06,397 --> 00:10:09,400
I said before that I hoped
to be able to repay your kindness.

173
00:10:09,483 --> 00:10:12,111
-That isn't necessary.
-It's already under way.

174
00:10:13,654 --> 00:10:15,948
Captain Archer...

175
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:19,619
You, your crew, this vessel,

176
00:10:19,702 --> 00:10:22,455
are all about to embark
on a glorious mission.

177
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:28,461
At this moment a number of my people
have taken positions around your vessel.

178
00:10:28,544 --> 00:10:32,548
Their bodies have been equipped
with powerful organic explosives.

179
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:35,343
With a single command,
I can order any one of them

180
00:10:35,426 --> 00:10:37,428
to sacrifice their lives.

181
00:10:37,511 --> 00:10:38,512
( communicator beeps )

182
00:10:38,596 --> 00:10:41,682
( speaks native language )

183
00:10:41,766 --> 00:10:44,185
( speaking native language )

184
00:10:53,277 --> 00:10:54,779
( groans )

185
00:11:07,249 --> 00:11:08,626
There's been an explosion on "C" deck.

186
00:11:08,709 --> 00:11:09,877
We've got a hull breach.

187
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:13,172
-Seal off the area. Get security teams--
-Stop.

188
00:11:13,255 --> 00:11:16,300
Two of my men are positioned
next to your warp reactor.

189
00:11:16,384 --> 00:11:20,471
Unless you turn this ship over to me,
I'll destroy it.

190
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:57,216
He has severe burns!

191
00:11:57,299 --> 00:11:59,927
The other two are suffering
from the effects of rapid decompression!

192
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:01,804
They need immediate medical attention!

193
00:12:01,887 --> 00:12:05,683
My orders are to escort everyone
to their quarters.

194
00:12:05,766 --> 00:12:08,352
I will not leave
without treating these people.

195
00:12:09,812 --> 00:12:11,272
Watch him.

196
00:12:18,737 --> 00:12:20,364
ARCHER:
They say they'll destroy <i>Enterprise.</i>

197
00:12:20,448 --> 00:12:21,866
I have to believe them.

198
00:12:21,949 --> 00:12:23,284
I can't believe
you're going along with this.

199
00:12:23,367 --> 00:12:25,244
Remember what's at stake,
why we're out here.

200
00:12:25,327 --> 00:12:26,912
Right now we don't have a choice.

201
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:29,457
Don't take any action against them.

202
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:31,417
Is that clear?

203
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:32,793
Aye, Captain.

204
00:12:34,837 --> 00:12:36,255
This isn't over.

205
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,302
Make yourself at home.

206
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:56,192
You made the right decision.

207
00:12:56,275 --> 00:12:59,653
I promise you,
your people won't be harmed.

208
00:13:00,946 --> 00:13:03,782
You just murdered one of my people.

209
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:08,829
I had to erase any doubts
you might have about our resolve.

210
00:13:10,247 --> 00:13:12,666
What do you want with my ship?

211
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:15,211
When I'm satisfied
the situation is secure,

212
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:17,213
I'll answer your questions.

213
00:13:23,969 --> 00:13:27,014
I also lost a crewman
in that explosion, Captain.

214
00:13:28,807 --> 00:13:31,018
I'll say a prayer for them both.

215
00:13:32,978 --> 00:13:34,980
Save your breath.

216
00:13:43,113 --> 00:13:45,658
Were you given the coordinates
for Triannon?

217
00:13:46,742 --> 00:13:48,202
Set a course.

218
00:13:48,285 --> 00:13:50,079
Your highest warp factor.

219
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:56,627
Prepare to fire two of your torpedoes.

220
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:58,712
Target my ship's reactor.

221
00:14:02,591 --> 00:14:03,968
You heard me.

222
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:10,015
Release the docking clamps.

223
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:27,575
( door opens )

224
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:39,211
I promised you an explanation.

225
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:40,880
I owe you that.

226
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:42,882
Where are you taking this ship?

227
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:45,593
To my homeworld.

228
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:48,220
We'll be there in three days.

229
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:51,807
For the last century,
a violent group of heretics

230
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:53,601
have tried to undermine our way of life.

231
00:14:54,184 --> 00:14:57,271
With your ship, I can deliver
a final decisive attack.

232
00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:00,524
I can end this conflict forever.

233
00:15:00,608 --> 00:15:01,775
War.

234
00:15:03,652 --> 00:15:06,906
That was the "glorious mission"
you were talking about?

235
00:15:06,989 --> 00:15:08,616
I'm trying to save my people.

236
00:15:08,991 --> 00:15:11,827
Why do I have the feeling
these heretics would say the same thing?

237
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:13,412
They might very well.

238
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:16,540
But it doesn't change what they are.

239
00:15:16,624 --> 00:15:18,208
Enemies of the truth.

240
00:15:18,292 --> 00:15:19,752
Your truth.

241
00:15:19,835 --> 00:15:21,503
There's only one.

242
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:26,300
How many people do you intend
to kill with my ship?

243
00:15:26,383 --> 00:15:27,593
( laughs )

244
00:15:27,676 --> 00:15:31,847
Your species is obsessed with numbers.

245
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:33,933
A characteristic of your misguided belief

246
00:15:34,016 --> 00:15:38,646
that the secrets of the universe
can be revealed through science.

247
00:15:38,729 --> 00:15:40,439
This may sound barbaric to you,

248
00:15:40,522 --> 00:15:43,067
but it doesn't matter
how many heretics die.

249
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:47,655
When the Makers return,
only the faithful will survive.

250
00:15:47,738 --> 00:15:50,032
Nonbelievers will be swept away.

251
00:15:50,115 --> 00:15:54,495
Not only Triannons
but every race within the Chosen Realm.

252
00:15:54,578 --> 00:15:57,998
Doctrines like that make it real easy

253
00:15:58,082 --> 00:15:59,959
to wipe out everyone
who doesn't agree with you.

254
00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:03,963
You're wrong. It's not easy.

255
00:16:04,046 --> 00:16:07,216
If it were, I wouldn't be dreading
what I have to do next.

256
00:16:12,304 --> 00:16:14,098
I've been reviewing your records.

257
00:16:15,099 --> 00:16:18,560
You've committed
terrible acts of desecration.

258
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:22,439
Not only have you flown within
the cloaking barrier of three spheres,

259
00:16:22,523 --> 00:16:25,776
you've landed on one and entered another.

260
00:16:26,902 --> 00:16:29,071
For crimes of this magnitude,

261
00:16:29,154 --> 00:16:33,909
my faith obligates me to destroy your ship
and put your crew to death.

262
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:35,285
However...

263
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:40,332
I cannot ignore the fact

264
00:16:40,749 --> 00:16:44,253
that you put yourselves at risk
to save us.

265
00:16:45,713 --> 00:16:47,715
And that I like you, Captain.

266
00:16:47,798 --> 00:16:50,592
-( scoffs )
-I believe you're an honorable man.

267
00:16:52,761 --> 00:16:56,181
So I am going against
what my faith dictates.

268
00:16:56,265 --> 00:16:58,517
I'm going to temper the punishment.

269
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:01,520
As commander of this ship,

270
00:17:01,603 --> 00:17:04,565
you may choose one member
of your crew to give up their life.

271
00:17:04,648 --> 00:17:06,150
You're out of your mind.

272
00:17:06,233 --> 00:17:08,193
If you won't choose, I'll choose for you.

273
00:17:10,446 --> 00:17:12,865
I take no pleasure in this, Captain,
believe me.

274
00:17:14,658 --> 00:17:16,285
I need time to think about this.

275
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:19,830
You have six hours.

276
00:17:19,913 --> 00:17:23,584
I urge you to use this time
to search within yourself

277
00:17:23,667 --> 00:17:26,795
and put these lies out of your mind.

278
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:29,256
All of this data that you've collected...

279
00:17:30,924 --> 00:17:34,762
-( beeping )
-Must be erased from existence.

280
00:17:34,845 --> 00:17:35,846
( beeping )

281
00:17:43,771 --> 00:17:45,230
Six hours, Captain.

282
00:18:03,332 --> 00:18:05,042
( door opens )

283
00:18:07,795 --> 00:18:09,838
An update on the repairs to your ship.

284
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:12,091
D'Jamat felt you should be kept apprised.

285
00:18:12,174 --> 00:18:14,301
ARCHER: That's very considerate of him.

286
00:18:15,052 --> 00:18:16,053
Wait a minute.

287
00:18:19,389 --> 00:18:22,267
-Your name's Yarrick, isn't it?
-It is.

288
00:18:23,811 --> 00:18:26,605
I understand your wife
paid a visit to sick bay.

289
00:18:27,397 --> 00:18:29,608
She had a long talk with my doctor.

290
00:18:29,691 --> 00:18:31,235
She's pregnant.

291
00:18:32,236 --> 00:18:33,237
Yes.

292
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:37,032
I guess you also know that
she wants to end the pregnancy.

293
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:38,867
That's between her and me.

294
00:18:40,202 --> 00:18:44,665
My doctor got the impression
that she doesn't exactly agree

295
00:18:44,748 --> 00:18:46,750
with D'Jamat's interpretation
of your faith.

296
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:48,919
As a matter of fact,

297
00:18:49,002 --> 00:18:52,631
Phlox said she's grown
to hate everything about it.

298
00:18:52,714 --> 00:18:53,632
That's not true.

299
00:18:53,715 --> 00:18:54,925
He also got the impression

300
00:18:55,008 --> 00:18:57,594
that you're not happy with
the way things are going either.

301
00:18:58,262 --> 00:19:02,015
D'Jamat is my spiritual leader.
I will follow him to my death.

302
00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:03,225
From what I've seen,

303
00:19:03,308 --> 00:19:06,353
I'm pretty sure you're
gonna have that opportunity.

304
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:17,823
You went to their doctor?

305
00:19:17,906 --> 00:19:20,826
You put us at risk. He told his captain.

306
00:19:20,909 --> 00:19:23,120
-Does D'Jamat know?
-I don't think so.

307
00:19:25,122 --> 00:19:27,166
-Did you have the procedure?
-No.

308
00:19:27,249 --> 00:19:30,127
The doctor said he needed time
to review our physiology.

309
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:32,421
He's under guard now. It's too late.

310
00:19:32,504 --> 00:19:34,256
It's just as well.

311
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:35,924
Have you changed your mind?

312
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:37,885
I'm not certain
it's the right thing to do.

313
00:19:37,968 --> 00:19:41,305
I won't watch my son or daughter
fight in D'Jamat's war.

314
00:19:41,388 --> 00:19:44,725
We have the ship now.
We'll end the war once and for all.

315
00:19:44,808 --> 00:19:47,728
You don't believe that any more than I do.

316
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:54,735
-( door chimes )
-Enter.

317
00:19:56,445 --> 00:19:58,864
Ah. I'm glad you've come.

318
00:20:04,411 --> 00:20:07,456
I was just looking at your captain's logs.

319
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:10,542
I had no idea
we were such kindred spirits.

320
00:20:10,626 --> 00:20:12,502
What makes you think that?

321
00:20:12,586 --> 00:20:14,546
I know why you're here.

322
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:17,090
In the... expanse?

323
00:20:18,175 --> 00:20:20,761
It turns out we're both fighting
to save our people.

324
00:20:20,844 --> 00:20:23,263
I'm trying to stop my world
from being destroyed.

325
00:20:23,347 --> 00:20:26,725
You're trying to wipe out everyone
who doesn't share your beliefs.

326
00:20:27,309 --> 00:20:30,187
Our situations aren't
as different as you think.

327
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:33,482
I draw the line
at murdering innocent people.

328
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:35,692
And not torture?

329
00:20:36,568 --> 00:20:39,196
In your log,
there is an incident with a prisoner,

330
00:20:39,279 --> 00:20:41,782
an interrogation
that made use of an airlock.

331
00:20:41,865 --> 00:20:44,785
I needed information
critical to my mission.

332
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:47,162
He wasn't hurt.

333
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:49,706
I sympathize with you, Captain.

334
00:20:50,374 --> 00:20:52,960
I've had to make hard choices as well.

335
00:20:53,585 --> 00:20:56,672
When I was young,
I fought with the holy regiments.

336
00:20:56,755 --> 00:20:59,341
I was commanding a mission.

337
00:20:59,424 --> 00:21:03,512
We'd infiltrated a village known
to be a heretic stronghold.

338
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:06,515
We were instructed to stay concealed

339
00:21:06,598 --> 00:21:09,768
and relay intelligence
about enemy movements.

340
00:21:11,728 --> 00:21:14,523
But one of the villagers discovered us.

341
00:21:15,482 --> 00:21:17,317
It was a small boy.

342
00:21:17,818 --> 00:21:20,279
No more than six years old.

343
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:25,534
We knew if we let him go,
he would alert the village.

344
00:21:27,077 --> 00:21:30,914
And if we tried to hold him,
he might give us away.

345
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:35,377
There was only one action to take.

346
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:40,340
So I took it.

347
00:21:41,842 --> 00:21:43,552
You're proud of that.

348
00:21:47,055 --> 00:21:51,935
In the service of the Makers,
all actions are blessed ones.

349
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:53,437
There are no Makers.

350
00:21:53,937 --> 00:21:55,689
At least not how you perceive them.

351
00:21:55,772 --> 00:21:57,232
The spheres are machines

352
00:21:57,316 --> 00:22:00,777
built for a reason
you and I don't understand.

353
00:22:00,861 --> 00:22:02,863
I was once like you.

354
00:22:03,864 --> 00:22:05,240
But then I felt the Breath.

355
00:22:07,826 --> 00:22:09,703
I prayed for you, Captain.

356
00:22:09,786 --> 00:22:12,748
I had hoped that the Makers
would open your eyes to the truth.

357
00:22:13,373 --> 00:22:15,959
But it seems that they've turned away.

358
00:22:22,132 --> 00:22:23,717
You had a choice to make.

359
00:22:24,926 --> 00:22:25,927
I've made it.

360
00:22:26,928 --> 00:22:29,097
And which crew member have you selected?

361
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:31,808
I've chosen myself.

362
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:37,189
You wanted to kill someone.

363
00:22:37,272 --> 00:22:38,940
Kill me.

364
00:22:42,652 --> 00:22:44,362
I urge you to reconsider.

365
00:22:44,446 --> 00:22:47,449
I won't make someone else pay for
something that happened under my command.

366
00:22:47,532 --> 00:22:49,409
But what about your mission?

367
00:22:49,493 --> 00:22:52,621
When I'm through with your ship,
your crew will need their captain.

368
00:22:53,163 --> 00:22:54,664
T'Pol is a fine commander.

369
00:22:55,624 --> 00:22:58,001
We are more alike than you think, Captain.

370
00:23:01,296 --> 00:23:03,048
I would make the same choice.

371
00:23:03,757 --> 00:23:06,051
I respect your decision.

372
00:23:06,134 --> 00:23:08,220
Then maybe you'll grant a request.

373
00:23:08,303 --> 00:23:10,138
What is it?

374
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:13,058
My people have certain customs
regarding death.

375
00:23:13,725 --> 00:23:15,936
There's a device on board.

376
00:23:16,019 --> 00:23:18,647
We use it to dispose
of hazardous materials.

377
00:23:19,898 --> 00:23:23,235
But on rare occasions,
when the situation arises,

378
00:23:23,902 --> 00:23:25,737
we've also used it for executions.

379
00:23:27,948 --> 00:23:29,783
It's considered humane.

380
00:23:39,167 --> 00:23:40,836
Where is this device?

381
00:23:47,551 --> 00:23:50,011
The molecules have been disassembled.

382
00:23:51,471 --> 00:23:52,848
Quick and painless.

383
00:23:56,226 --> 00:23:58,645
I can't change your mind?

384
00:23:59,771 --> 00:24:01,940
No more than I can change yours.

385
00:24:02,607 --> 00:24:05,026
Very well. Proceed.

386
00:24:08,822 --> 00:24:09,990
Captain...

387
00:24:10,073 --> 00:24:12,868
Ask Phlox to keep an eye on Porthos.

388
00:24:17,831 --> 00:24:19,457
Take care of <i>Enterprise.</i>

389
00:24:29,634 --> 00:24:30,886
This won't end here.

390
00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:45,984
( inaudible )

391
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:55,285
You have my sympathies.

392
00:24:56,328 --> 00:24:59,247
You should inform your crew.
They deserve to know.

393
00:25:14,804 --> 00:25:15,972
You've been quiet.

394
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:19,893
I'm just thinking
about what's ahead, Pri'Nam.

395
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:24,272
I know you too well.

396
00:25:25,899 --> 00:25:27,484
Tell me what's wrong.

397
00:25:30,195 --> 00:25:33,573
We've just begun this mission
and already three people are dead.

398
00:25:34,074 --> 00:25:36,243
-And that bothers you.
-Shouldn't it?

399
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:39,162
These people are not our enemy.

400
00:25:39,246 --> 00:25:43,959
They are nonbelievers.
That makes them our enemy.

401
00:25:45,001 --> 00:25:46,002
Why?

402
00:25:49,005 --> 00:25:53,260
Do you believe the Makers
speak through me?

403
00:25:54,177 --> 00:25:55,345
Yes.

404
00:25:55,428 --> 00:25:58,473
Then when you question me,
you question the Makers.

405
00:25:59,516 --> 00:26:02,102
And there's a word for that.

406
00:26:02,185 --> 00:26:03,478
Heresy.

407
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:07,065
Yarrick...

408
00:26:07,857 --> 00:26:10,860
When you begin to sympathize
with the enemy,

409
00:26:10,944 --> 00:26:13,947
you risk becoming the enemy.

410
00:26:16,992 --> 00:26:18,451
( beeping )

411
00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:00,618
Can I help you?

412
00:27:10,962 --> 00:27:12,547
( both grunting )

413
00:27:25,226 --> 00:27:26,561
I know.

414
00:27:26,644 --> 00:27:28,938
Medical scans are against your beliefs.

415
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:32,609
I don't think the Makers will mind.

416
00:27:35,111 --> 00:27:36,404
( beeping )

417
00:27:52,796 --> 00:27:54,422
-( door chimes )
-Enter.

418
00:27:55,465 --> 00:27:57,801
Lyaal is missing. He's not at his station.

419
00:27:57,884 --> 00:27:59,552
Lyaal.

420
00:28:01,137 --> 00:28:02,680
Lyaal.

421
00:28:03,848 --> 00:28:06,101
We'll use the ship's internal sensors
to find him.

422
00:28:06,184 --> 00:28:08,144
I need to locate one of my men.

423
00:28:10,647 --> 00:28:13,525
-We're dropping out of warp.
-Main power is being disrupted.

424
00:28:13,608 --> 00:28:14,901
From where?

425
00:28:16,861 --> 00:28:18,863
I can't identify the location.

426
00:28:26,871 --> 00:28:28,289
TUCKER: I'm telling you,
I didn't do anything.

427
00:28:28,373 --> 00:28:30,041
Ask your flunky over here.

428
00:28:30,125 --> 00:28:32,544
He's been looking over my shoulder
the whole time.

429
00:28:32,627 --> 00:28:35,296
It's true. He never left my sight.

430
00:28:37,632 --> 00:28:39,676
This did not happen by accident.

431
00:28:39,759 --> 00:28:41,845
Pri'Nam, there's something wrong

432
00:28:41,928 --> 00:28:45,181
with the EPS manifolds on deck "D,"
section J-15.

433
00:28:45,265 --> 00:28:47,600
Yarrick, go with him.

434
00:28:54,566 --> 00:28:56,025
It's on the left.

435
00:28:57,485 --> 00:28:58,945
You passed it.

436
00:28:59,028 --> 00:29:00,947
You don't want to do that.

437
00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:04,701
You can't win. They'll destroy the ship.

438
00:29:04,784 --> 00:29:06,536
Not if you help me.

439
00:29:06,619 --> 00:29:08,079
No.

440
00:29:08,538 --> 00:29:10,457
You know this is wrong.

441
00:29:10,957 --> 00:29:12,667
Everything he's doing.

442
00:29:13,168 --> 00:29:15,170
We can put a stop to it, all of it.

443
00:29:15,253 --> 00:29:18,840
-I won't betray my faith.
-Your faith betrayed you.

444
00:29:18,923 --> 00:29:20,925
Is this really what the Makers want?

445
00:29:21,009 --> 00:29:23,762
To kill people
by the thousands in their name?

446
00:29:23,845 --> 00:29:26,139
Is that the faith you were raised in?

447
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:29,142
-No.
-Then do what's right!

448
00:29:30,477 --> 00:29:32,228
If you don't help me,

449
00:29:32,729 --> 00:29:35,815
you'll be condemning
your wife and child to death

450
00:29:35,899 --> 00:29:38,443
because that's how this is going to end.

451
00:29:38,526 --> 00:29:43,615
As long as people like D'Jamat
dictate what's true and what isn't...

452
00:29:46,075 --> 00:29:47,786
all you'll ever have is war.

453
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:55,335
Have you located Lyaal?

454
00:29:55,418 --> 00:29:57,128
Internal sensors aren't functioning.

455
00:29:57,212 --> 00:29:59,172
Systems are down all over the ship.

456
00:29:59,255 --> 00:30:00,840
( beeping )

457
00:30:01,591 --> 00:30:02,967
What is it?

458
00:30:03,051 --> 00:30:05,512
There's a convoy of ships approaching.

459
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:08,598
Let me see them.

460
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:16,064
These people you're fighting...
what makes them heretics?

461
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:21,069
We believe the Makers created
the Chosen Realm in nine days.

462
00:30:21,152 --> 00:30:22,487
They believe it took 10.

463
00:30:23,446 --> 00:30:25,031
( scoffs )

464
00:30:25,114 --> 00:30:27,075
For that you've been at war
for over a century?

465
00:30:29,661 --> 00:30:31,955
-Found it.
-What is it?

466
00:30:32,038 --> 00:30:34,749
The environmental controls
need to be rerouted to sick bay.

467
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:36,167
That can only be done from the bridge.

468
00:30:36,251 --> 00:30:37,418
I'm gonna show you how to do it.

469
00:30:38,002 --> 00:30:39,045
Why?

470
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:42,131
Dr. Phlox has synthesized
an airborne agent.

471
00:30:42,215 --> 00:30:44,259
It neutralizes one of the enzymes used

472
00:30:44,342 --> 00:30:47,846
in the organic explosives,
renders it inert.

473
00:30:47,929 --> 00:30:49,806
-( beeping )
-They're hailing us.

474
00:30:52,684 --> 00:30:53,977
D'JAMAT: Surrender now.

475
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:55,895
<i>I have four ships.</i>

476
00:30:55,979 --> 00:30:58,857
If you had 10 ships,
you wouldn't survive against this vessel.

477
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:02,443
Run your scans.
You'll see that I'm telling the truth.

478
00:31:02,527 --> 00:31:05,280
Surrender, and you'll be treated fairly.

479
00:31:05,363 --> 00:31:07,365
<i>You consider us heretics.</i>

480
00:31:07,448 --> 00:31:10,076
<i>We know what you do to them, D'Jamat.</i>

481
00:31:12,996 --> 00:31:15,164
Target the lead vessel.

482
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:16,541
Do what I say!

483
00:31:17,125 --> 00:31:18,209
No.

484
00:31:24,465 --> 00:31:26,426
Prepare to fire torpedoes.

485
00:31:43,693 --> 00:31:45,445
One of the ships has lost engines.

486
00:31:45,528 --> 00:31:46,821
Target their main reactor.

487
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:52,201
( grunting )

488
00:32:03,338 --> 00:32:04,839
( screeching )

489
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:12,931
Don't worry. It's harmless.

490
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:17,518
Unless it's agitated.

491
00:32:28,237 --> 00:32:29,906
Captain.

492
00:32:29,989 --> 00:32:33,409
We have to get to the armory.
We're retaking the ship.

493
00:32:33,493 --> 00:32:34,953
We need the macos.

494
00:32:37,664 --> 00:32:38,748
Pri'Nam.

495
00:32:38,831 --> 00:32:40,166
It's begun.

496
00:32:40,249 --> 00:32:41,960
What's the status of the engines?

497
00:32:42,043 --> 00:32:44,379
We've located the problem.
It's under repair.

498
00:32:44,462 --> 00:32:45,505
( explosion )

499
00:32:45,588 --> 00:32:48,091
The warp reactor should be functioning
in a few hours.

500
00:32:48,174 --> 00:32:49,258
They're retreating.

501
00:32:49,342 --> 00:32:51,010
Stay with them.

502
00:32:54,305 --> 00:32:55,932
Do what I say.

503
00:33:05,441 --> 00:33:07,485
Bring us within firing distance.

504
00:33:07,568 --> 00:33:09,404
Prepare to lock weapons.

505
00:33:11,322 --> 00:33:12,615
PHLOX: Careful!

506
00:33:12,699 --> 00:33:14,158
There's no antidote for the venom.

507
00:33:14,242 --> 00:33:15,284
( screeching )

508
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,621
( clicks )

509
00:33:22,583 --> 00:33:24,502
There'll be an extra helping
of snow beetles

510
00:33:24,585 --> 00:33:26,879
for you tonight, young lady.

511
00:33:46,524 --> 00:33:48,526
MAN: Their engines are at maximum.

512
00:33:48,609 --> 00:33:49,944
We're still gaining.

513
00:33:50,028 --> 00:33:53,322
D'JAMAT: Good.
We'll eliminate them one by one.

514
00:33:54,741 --> 00:33:55,908
( beeping )

515
00:34:24,062 --> 00:34:25,938
MAN: Hold your fire!

516
00:34:46,667 --> 00:34:47,794
Don't move.

517
00:34:54,634 --> 00:34:55,885
( grunts )

518
00:34:58,554 --> 00:35:00,139
They're coming into range.

519
00:35:01,557 --> 00:35:02,892
Lock weapons.

520
00:35:59,448 --> 00:36:00,867
( crackles )

521
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:02,994
( grunting )

522
00:36:36,986 --> 00:36:38,029
( beeps )

523
00:36:41,574 --> 00:36:44,660
They're sending a transmission.
They want to surrender.

524
00:36:44,744 --> 00:36:45,953
Continue firing.

525
00:36:47,538 --> 00:36:49,916
-( buzzes )
-Weapons aren't functioning.

526
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:53,377
-( beeps )
<i>-Archer to the bridge.</i>

527
00:36:53,461 --> 00:36:55,880
<i>We've rerouted command functions</i>
<i>to engineering.</i>

528
00:36:55,963 --> 00:36:57,757
<i>I've taken weapons off-line.</i>

529
00:36:58,883 --> 00:36:59,967
Find him.

530
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:04,055
We've also neutralized
your organic explosives.

531
00:37:04,138 --> 00:37:05,348
D'JAMAT: <i>You're lying.</i>

532
00:37:05,431 --> 00:37:07,516
Go ahead. Try to blow yourself up.

533
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:08,893
<i>I'll wait.</i>

534
00:37:11,062 --> 00:37:13,481
Stand down before anyone else gets hurt.

535
00:37:13,981 --> 00:37:15,441
You know I won't do that.

536
00:37:15,524 --> 00:37:16,859
MAN: Pri'Nam!

537
00:37:18,194 --> 00:37:19,528
They're coming about.

538
00:37:22,156 --> 00:37:24,492
They're firing again, Captain!

539
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:28,955
I suggest you bring
your weapons back online!

540
00:37:35,962 --> 00:37:39,215
Are you willing to sacrifice
the lives of your crew?

541
00:37:49,642 --> 00:37:50,726
( grunts )

542
00:38:00,569 --> 00:38:01,779
( yells )

543
00:38:12,206 --> 00:38:15,584
Captain, it's Reed. We have the bridge.

544
00:38:17,128 --> 00:38:19,297
This would be a lot easier
if I had weapons back.

545
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:20,881
ARCHER:<i> Stand by.</i>

546
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:35,730
( explosion )

547
00:38:40,067 --> 00:38:41,402
Hail them.

548
00:38:46,574 --> 00:38:47,783
( beeps )

549
00:38:49,035 --> 00:38:50,786
This is Captain Archer.

550
00:38:52,038 --> 00:38:54,999
D'Jamat is no longer in control
of this vessel.

551
00:38:55,791 --> 00:38:57,209
Please respond.

552
00:39:01,422 --> 00:39:03,507
We've retaken the ship.

553
00:39:03,591 --> 00:39:05,176
I'm in command again.

554
00:39:05,259 --> 00:39:07,553
<i>Why should I believe you?</i>

555
00:39:07,636 --> 00:39:09,722
I'm powering down my weapons.

556
00:39:14,393 --> 00:39:15,644
See for yourself.

557
00:39:16,729 --> 00:39:18,022
( beeping )

558
00:39:26,489 --> 00:39:28,240
( beeping )

559
00:39:28,324 --> 00:39:29,700
They're moving off.

560
00:39:31,786 --> 00:39:33,120
( sighs )

561
00:39:47,843 --> 00:39:50,429
We just entered orbit around Triannon.

562
00:39:50,513 --> 00:39:51,847
Let's go.

563
00:39:53,516 --> 00:39:56,018
You've done a terrible thing, Captain.

564
00:39:56,894 --> 00:39:59,980
You've interfered with something
that was ordained.

565
00:40:00,064 --> 00:40:02,066
After centuries of fighting,

566
00:40:02,149 --> 00:40:04,276
I was going to bring an end to the war.

567
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:05,528
We would have had peace.

568
00:40:05,611 --> 00:40:06,821
Peace?

569
00:40:06,904 --> 00:40:09,115
One of my crewmen is dead.
Six others are wounded.

570
00:40:09,198 --> 00:40:11,909
-My ship is damaged--
-None of that is important!

571
00:40:11,992 --> 00:40:14,787
All that matters is the sacred truth.

572
00:40:15,329 --> 00:40:16,414
( scoffs )

573
00:40:16,497 --> 00:40:17,915
You want truth?

574
00:40:19,834 --> 00:40:21,460
I'll show you some truth.

575
00:41:19,268 --> 00:41:22,438
From what we've been able to learn,
this happened eight months ago.

576
00:41:23,105 --> 00:41:25,441
Both sides have been decimated.

577
00:41:25,524 --> 00:41:27,818
There are no major cities left.

578
00:41:28,486 --> 00:41:31,071
Millions are dead.

579
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:36,702
Your faith was going to bring peace.

580
00:41:39,497 --> 00:41:40,706
Here it is.
