1
00:00:02,127 --> 00:00:05,005
( rumbling )

2
00:00:05,088 --> 00:00:06,840
( alarm beeping )

3
00:00:19,144 --> 00:00:20,145
Who are you?

4
00:00:22,105 --> 00:00:24,065
They're targeting our engines!

5
00:00:24,149 --> 00:00:26,109
What do you want with me?

6
00:00:27,694 --> 00:00:29,070
ARCHER: You're the weapons expert.

7
00:00:29,154 --> 00:00:31,197
See if you can get
those shields back online.

8
00:00:31,281 --> 00:00:32,574
( grunting )

9
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:35,744
If we don't raise the shields,

10
00:00:35,827 --> 00:00:36,828
the only thing that's gonna
be left of this ship

11
00:00:36,911 --> 00:00:38,455
is a cloud of vapor!

12
00:00:38,538 --> 00:00:40,373
( beeping continues )

13
00:00:49,674 --> 00:00:51,009
Insectoids!

14
00:00:51,092 --> 00:00:53,428
ARCHER: These could be shield emitters.

15
00:00:58,516 --> 00:01:00,435
They're not gonna last for long.

16
00:01:02,145 --> 00:01:04,105
Open a channel to those ships.

17
00:01:04,189 --> 00:01:05,523
-What?
-They're Xindi!

18
00:01:05,607 --> 00:01:07,442
I'll order them to hold their fire.

19
00:01:07,525 --> 00:01:10,070
It's been a long time since
any Xindi took orders from you.

20
00:01:10,612 --> 00:01:12,530
( ammunition firing )

21
00:01:19,621 --> 00:01:23,166
ARCHER: We're carrying 500 liters
of warp plasma in the starboard tanks.

22
00:01:23,249 --> 00:01:25,418
We'll have to vent it.

23
00:01:25,502 --> 00:01:27,003
Turn these down on my mark.

24
00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:31,299
They're gonna destroy us!

25
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:36,638
Now!

26
00:01:41,726 --> 00:01:43,061
( beeping stops )

27
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:46,731
( sighs )

28
00:01:46,815 --> 00:01:48,233
What happened?

29
00:01:48,316 --> 00:01:50,693
The plasma got into
their intake manifolds.

30
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:53,238
Their engines are overheating.

31
00:01:54,656 --> 00:01:56,324
I want to know who you are.

32
00:01:56,741 --> 00:01:58,535
Why you've abducted me.

33
00:01:59,577 --> 00:02:00,995
You really don't remember.

34
00:02:02,747 --> 00:02:04,541
( sighs )

35
00:02:04,624 --> 00:02:06,334
I was afraid this might happen.

36
00:02:06,417 --> 00:02:08,753
It's me... Archer.

37
00:02:09,337 --> 00:02:10,880
What species are you?

38
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:14,175
You've been through a lot
in the last two days.

39
00:02:14,259 --> 00:02:16,761
-Just let me figure out--
-What species?

40
00:02:20,056 --> 00:02:21,432
I'm human.

41
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:29,107
You're from the Earth vessel.

42
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:32,318
Degra, you have to listen to me.

43
00:02:32,402 --> 00:02:34,320
I'm not your enemy anymore.

44
00:02:34,404 --> 00:02:37,991
You've spent the last two days
in an interrogation chamber.

45
00:02:38,074 --> 00:02:39,742
Whatever the Insectoids
did to you in there

46
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:41,870
must have affected your memory.

47
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:48,751
My name is Jonathan Archer.

48
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:51,629
The two of us just escaped
from an Insectoid prison colony.

49
00:02:51,713 --> 00:02:53,423
Prison?

50
00:02:53,506 --> 00:02:56,634
We've shared a cell
for almost three years.

51
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,305
That's not possible.

52
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:03,725
Roll up your sleeve.

53
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:18,031
The conflict between our people is over.

54
00:03:19,198 --> 00:03:20,241
We both lost.

55
00:03:22,327 --> 00:03:24,787
I promise I'll explain everything.

56
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:26,414
But right now we have to get out of here,

57
00:03:26,497 --> 00:03:28,583
before our friends out there
repair their engines.

58
00:03:28,666 --> 00:03:31,878
-What are you doin'?
-There's a system about a week from here.

59
00:03:31,961 --> 00:03:33,630
It's isolated.

60
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:35,924
I doubt they'll look for us there.

61
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:38,885

( chuckles )

84
00:05:23,698 --> 00:05:25,658
You think that's amusing?

85
00:05:25,742 --> 00:05:27,160
It's been a while
since you referred to those

86
00:05:27,243 --> 00:05:30,204
overgrown grasshoppers
as your "own people."

87
00:05:30,288 --> 00:05:33,041
{\an8}Why don't I remember you?

88
00:05:33,124 --> 00:05:35,376
{\an8}Probably because of the bloodworms.

89
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:36,794
{\an8}Bloodworms?

90
00:05:36,878 --> 00:05:38,504
{\an8}They're used during interrogations.

91
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:40,298
{\an8}Their secretions act as a truth serum.

92
00:05:40,381 --> 00:05:43,509
{\an8}Makes the prisoners more cooperative.

93
00:05:43,593 --> 00:05:45,344
But there's a side effect.

94
00:05:45,428 --> 00:05:47,847
Sometimes they can suppress memories.

95
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:50,099
The same thing happened
when they questioned me.

96
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:53,144
I forgot everything that
happened since flight school.

97
00:05:53,227 --> 00:05:55,813
{\an8}It'll start to come back to you.
Give it a few days.

98
00:05:55,897 --> 00:05:57,982
{\an8}You claim that I've been
a prisoner for three years.

99
00:05:58,066 --> 00:05:59,317
{\an8}Three years.

100
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:02,737
{\an8}It that's true,
why would they question me now?

101
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:05,531
{\an8}They wanted information about the weapon.

102
00:06:06,949 --> 00:06:08,618
{\an8}What kind of information?

103
00:06:13,289 --> 00:06:15,458
{\an8}This is gonna take some time.

104
00:06:18,127 --> 00:06:19,712
{\an8}What's the last thing you remember?

105
00:06:20,505 --> 00:06:23,508
{\an8}I was on my vessel,

106
00:06:23,591 --> 00:06:25,510
{\an8}approaching a planet
in the Calindra system.

107
00:06:25,593 --> 00:06:27,678
{\an8}The weapon test.

108
00:06:27,762 --> 00:06:30,264
{\an8}It failed because
your prototype was sabotaged.

109
00:06:30,348 --> 00:06:31,724
{\an8}How would you know that?

110
00:06:32,558 --> 00:06:35,478
{\an8}Because I'm responsible for it.

111
00:06:35,561 --> 00:06:37,939
{\an8}Your Kemocite shipment was tampered with.

112
00:06:39,565 --> 00:06:40,775
{\an8}Gralik.

113
00:06:42,276 --> 00:06:43,736
{\an8}He wasn't too happy when I told him

114
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:45,696
{\an8}what you were planning to do
with his Kemocite.

115
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:48,282
{\an8}He'll be executed for this.

116
00:06:49,951 --> 00:06:51,119
{\an8}He was.

117
00:06:55,706 --> 00:06:58,000
In the end,
it didn't make much of a difference.

118
00:06:59,585 --> 00:07:02,922
We didn't stop your program.
We only slowed it down.

119
00:07:05,424 --> 00:07:08,219
A few weeks later,
the weapon was launched.

120
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:11,556
It destroyed my planet.

121
00:07:15,184 --> 00:07:17,019
We were successful?

122
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:20,815
I don't know if you'd call it a success.

123
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:29,449
After Earth was destroyed,
the old Xindi rivalries surfaced again.

124
00:07:30,158 --> 00:07:33,411
The Insectoids started attacking
other Xindi colonies.

125
00:07:33,494 --> 00:07:35,538
They killed thousands of your people.

126
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:40,126
The Reptilians and Aquatics
would never allow that.

127
00:07:41,043 --> 00:07:43,004
There wasn't a lot they could do.

128
00:07:44,422 --> 00:07:47,258
While you were busy
constructing the weapon,

129
00:07:47,341 --> 00:07:51,846
the Insectoids were secretly
building hundreds of new ships.

130
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:54,891
They used Earth as a diversion.

131
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:58,311
Their real goal was to dominate
the other Xindi species.

132
00:08:00,938 --> 00:08:02,565
Are you all right?

133
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:05,818
It's just a bloodworm.

134
00:08:05,902 --> 00:08:07,862
It'll work its way out.

135
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:11,782
Can you remove it?

136
00:08:35,806 --> 00:08:37,016
Hold still.

137
00:09:33,781 --> 00:09:35,700
I think you need this more than I do.

138
00:09:39,328 --> 00:09:40,746
Suit yourself.

139
00:09:43,499 --> 00:09:47,795
I don't understand how a Xindi and a human

140
00:09:47,878 --> 00:09:50,548
could put aside
their differences so quickly.

141
00:09:50,631 --> 00:09:53,301
( chuckles ) Trust me,
it didn't happen overnight.

142
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:58,014
You gave me this the first day
we were locked up together.

143
00:09:58,097 --> 00:09:59,473
The guards thought
it would be entertaining

144
00:09:59,557 --> 00:10:01,225
to put us in the same cell.

145
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:04,312
They even placed wagers on
who would survive the longest.

146
00:10:04,395 --> 00:10:08,816
I was in pretty bad shape at the time,
so you were the odds-on favorite.

147
00:10:12,403 --> 00:10:14,864
Your people killed everyone
I ever cared about.

148
00:10:17,575 --> 00:10:20,202
I was gonna make sure you never
walked out of that cell.

149
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:23,581
For weeks, we tried to kill each other.

150
00:10:25,499 --> 00:10:30,338
I was lying in the infirmary
when I finally asked myself,

151
00:10:30,421 --> 00:10:33,382
what was the point?

152
00:10:35,593 --> 00:10:39,930
My world was gone, but so was yours.

153
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:44,060
So I made a proposal.

154
00:10:46,103 --> 00:10:49,148
The two of us would work together
to get out of that place.

155
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:52,693
It took us longer than
either one of us thought.

156
00:10:52,777 --> 00:10:54,362
( chuckles )

157
00:10:54,445 --> 00:10:55,946
Here we are.

158
00:10:59,241 --> 00:11:01,827
I don't recognize this type of ship.

159
00:11:02,536 --> 00:11:04,288
It's a Malosian cargo shuttle.

160
00:11:04,705 --> 00:11:06,874
-Malosian?
-They're traders.

161
00:11:06,957 --> 00:11:11,253
They bring supplies to the prison
a few times a month.

162
00:11:13,255 --> 00:11:17,635
No weapons, but she's sturdy enough
to get us where we're going.

163
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:22,098
Perhaps we should set a course
to your vessel.

164
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:24,683
Is it still in the expanse?

165
00:11:26,394 --> 00:11:27,770
Not exactly.

166
00:11:31,774 --> 00:11:34,860
When we were getting close
to finding your weapon,

167
00:11:34,944 --> 00:11:37,405
the Insectoids sent their ships after us.

168
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:40,908
They boarded <i>Enterprise</i>
and took me prisoner.

169
00:11:42,952 --> 00:11:46,288
Then they planted spatial charges
around our warp reactor.

170
00:11:47,998 --> 00:11:50,626
My crew was still aboard
when they detonated them.

171
00:11:56,507 --> 00:11:59,760
The Insectoids were always
an aggressive species,

172
00:11:59,844 --> 00:12:01,971
but I never thought them capable of this.

173
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:05,766
They destroyed everything
the Council worked for.

174
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:07,268
The Council?

175
00:12:07,351 --> 00:12:09,019
It was formed
when our planet was destroyed.

176
00:12:09,103 --> 00:12:13,315
It was created to find a new homeworld
for all Xindi.

177
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:16,986
After years of searching,
we found a few suitable locations,

178
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:20,614
but, as usual,
couldn't agree on a final choice.

179
00:12:20,698 --> 00:12:26,495
Our plan for reunification was put aside
when we learned of the threat from Earth.

180
00:12:27,788 --> 00:12:31,500
I was ordered
to begin designing the weapon.

181
00:12:32,376 --> 00:12:34,295
I devoted years to it.

182
00:12:34,378 --> 00:12:36,505
I made so many sacrifices.

183
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:38,174
So did my wife.

184
00:12:40,176 --> 00:12:42,970
Do I know...

185
00:12:44,638 --> 00:12:46,265
What happened to my family?

186
00:12:46,682 --> 00:12:51,228
You told me you'd heard from Naara
before you were sent to prison.

187
00:12:52,813 --> 00:12:54,315
She and the children were safe.

188
00:13:02,406 --> 00:13:03,866
We have a ship now.

189
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:06,785
We can look for them.

190
00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:10,623
They were on a colony near a Red Giant.

191
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:14,835
( computer beeping )

192
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:17,338
There's nothing in range.
Do you remember the coordinates?

193
00:13:17,421 --> 00:13:18,547
I doubt if there's anything left.

194
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:20,925
It would've been one of the first colonies
to have been attacked.

195
00:13:21,008 --> 00:13:22,468
There may have been survivors.

196
00:13:23,844 --> 00:13:25,137
It's too dangerous.

197
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:28,349
The patrol ships are still looking for us.

198
00:13:29,433 --> 00:13:30,809
We should find a refuge in case--

199
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:32,728
( hissing )

200
00:13:34,104 --> 00:13:35,564
Reactor coolant.

201
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:37,274
The conduit must have
ruptured in the attack.

202
00:13:37,358 --> 00:13:39,777
( both coughing )

203
00:13:52,373 --> 00:13:53,999
-Take it.
-What about you?

204
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:55,543
You're the one with a family.

205
00:13:56,835 --> 00:13:58,045
You want to see them again?

206
00:14:01,882 --> 00:14:04,385
Try to seal the rupture.

207
00:14:04,468 --> 00:14:08,973
I'll see if I can... ( coughs )
close off the coolant tanks.

208
00:14:09,056 --> 00:14:10,933
( coughing )

209
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:45,050
( gasps )

210
00:14:45,134 --> 00:14:46,844
( coughing )

211
00:15:44,193 --> 00:15:45,861
( hisses )

212
00:15:55,871 --> 00:15:57,289
<i>T'Pol.</i>

213
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:09,635
He should remain unconscious
for at least two hours.

214
00:16:09,718 --> 00:16:11,720
The son of a bitch designed the weapon.

215
00:16:13,889 --> 00:16:15,808
Keep an eye on him.

216
00:16:15,891 --> 00:16:17,226
Trip.

217
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:27,528
-What have we got?
-There are seven Red Giants in this region

218
00:16:27,611 --> 00:16:30,239
but they're spread over
approximately 40 light-years.

219
00:16:30,322 --> 00:16:32,199
Can we scan them for a weapons facility?

220
00:16:32,282 --> 00:16:34,243
( sighs ) Not at this distance.

221
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:36,829
This Red Giant might be a red herring.

222
00:16:36,912 --> 00:16:39,707
He only told you his family was
living near one of these stars.

223
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:41,417
We don't know that the weapon's there.

224
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:42,960
Degra's a senior official.

225
00:16:43,043 --> 00:16:44,628
We know he's designing the weapon.

226
00:16:44,712 --> 00:16:47,214
There's a chance
he'd keep his family close by.

227
00:16:47,297 --> 00:16:49,299
For a moment I thought he was
gonna give you the coordinates.

228
00:16:49,383 --> 00:16:51,468
Too bad he didn't go for the Andorian ale.

229
00:16:51,552 --> 00:16:53,345
That would've loosened him up.

230
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:55,681
You appear to have gained his trust.

231
00:16:55,764 --> 00:16:58,600
Perhaps you should try
a more direct approach.

232
00:16:58,684 --> 00:17:00,060
What do you mean?

233
00:17:00,144 --> 00:17:02,730
Ask him where the weapon
is being constructed.

234
00:17:02,813 --> 00:17:04,565
It's too risky.

235
00:17:04,648 --> 00:17:08,610
If he suspects something,
we'll end up right back where we started.

236
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:11,947
He'll tell me.

237
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:16,994
I just need a little more time.

238
00:17:20,622 --> 00:17:24,293
{\an8}ARCHER: <i>Captain's starlog, </i>
<i>December 12, 2153.</i>

239
00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:26,003
<i>We've returned to the site</i>
<i>where the Xindi</i>

240
00:17:26,086 --> 00:17:28,422
<i>were testing the prototype weapon.</i>

241
00:17:28,505 --> 00:17:31,050
<i>An analysis of the debris</i>
<i>may tell us more about it.</i>

242
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:32,718
( sensors beeping )

243
00:17:32,801 --> 00:17:35,596
I'm picking up a ship
at the edge of the system.

244
00:17:37,848 --> 00:17:38,849
It's Xindi.

245
00:17:40,809 --> 00:17:42,853
-Why didn't we see it before?
-It may have been traveling

246
00:17:42,936 --> 00:17:45,564
through one of the subspace
vortices they use.

247
00:17:45,647 --> 00:17:49,443
Its hull signature matches the Xindi ships
that were here two days ago.

248
00:17:49,526 --> 00:17:52,321
Captain,
I'm reading three bio-signs on board.

249
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:54,406
Have they seen us yet?

250
00:17:54,782 --> 00:17:55,991
I don't believe so.

251
00:18:02,206 --> 00:18:03,665
Set course for the inner moon.

252
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:06,543
Stand by to deploy the sensor drones.

253
00:18:06,627 --> 00:18:07,878
( rumbling )

254
00:18:07,961 --> 00:18:09,463
-( alarm beeping )
-What's that?

255
00:18:09,546 --> 00:18:11,006
Weapons fire.

256
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:12,674
From where?

257
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:15,177
There's a ship closing.
It's the human vessel.

258
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:17,721
You said there was no one in the system!

259
00:18:17,805 --> 00:18:19,306
They must have been hiding in the debris.

260
00:18:22,309 --> 00:18:24,812
-Contact the Council!
-( beeping )

261
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:27,147
They've disabled our subspace transceiver!

262
00:18:27,231 --> 00:18:28,857
They're making a run for it.

263
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:30,818
See what you can do about their engines.

264
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:39,451
They're not going anywhere, sir.

265
00:18:40,828 --> 00:18:41,954
Hail them.

266
00:18:43,705 --> 00:18:45,749
Stand down and prepare to be boarded.

267
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:47,668
Thalen.

268
00:19:00,889 --> 00:19:02,349
Anything?

269
00:19:03,016 --> 00:19:04,935
They were attempting
to erase the computer core

270
00:19:05,018 --> 00:19:06,687
when we boarded the ship.

271
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:08,063
There's very little data left.

272
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:10,149
What about navigational logs?

273
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:13,485
They've been deleted.

274
00:19:13,569 --> 00:19:15,154
I may have something here, sir.

275
00:19:16,905 --> 00:19:19,741
I think these are fragments
from a personal file.

276
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:24,037
There are parts of a letter
from someone named "Degra."

277
00:19:25,289 --> 00:19:27,708
-Does it mention the weapon?
-No.

278
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:32,504
There's a reference to a planet
he visited recently.

279
00:19:32,588 --> 00:19:34,339
Azati Prime.

280
00:19:34,423 --> 00:19:36,008
Let me know what else you find.

281
00:19:38,552 --> 00:19:41,513
I'd love to spend an afternoon
taking this engine apart.

282
00:19:41,597 --> 00:19:43,640
Not your typical Nacelle configuration?

283
00:19:43,724 --> 00:19:47,394
Uh-uh. Look how everything's tied in
through their main deflector.

284
00:19:47,477 --> 00:19:49,980
Learn everything you can.

285
00:19:50,063 --> 00:19:52,024
( engines humming )

286
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:11,585
I want to know where
you're building the weapon.

287
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:13,879
I don't know what you're talking about.

288
00:20:13,962 --> 00:20:15,505
The hell you don't.

289
00:20:17,799 --> 00:20:19,009
Your name is Degra.

290
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:21,053
I was at the Xindi colony

291
00:20:21,136 --> 00:20:23,513
when you picked up
your shipment of Kemocite.

292
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:30,854
Your people are planning another attack.

293
00:20:30,938 --> 00:20:33,273
I'm not gonna let that happen.

294
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:38,362
By capturing us,
you've accomplished nothing.

295
00:20:39,863 --> 00:20:41,323
Where's the weapon?

296
00:20:45,369 --> 00:20:46,745
Archer to the bridge, report.

297
00:20:46,828 --> 00:20:48,789
There's a surge in the plasma network.

298
00:20:48,872 --> 00:20:50,540
ARCHER: <i>What's causing it?</i>

299
00:20:50,624 --> 00:20:54,378
Radiation from the debris field.
It's starting to affect our systems.

300
00:20:54,461 --> 00:20:57,673
Sir, I recommend putting a safe distance
between us and the test site.

301
00:20:57,756 --> 00:20:58,924
ARCHER:<i> All right.</i>

302
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:01,468
<i>Take the ship out of the field</i>
<i>but keep us close by.</i>

303
00:21:01,551 --> 00:21:02,719
Understood.

304
00:21:10,143 --> 00:21:14,147
If you won't tell me what I need to know,
perhaps one of your men will.

305
00:21:16,858 --> 00:21:21,113
When my superiors learn we're missing,
they'll find your ship and destroy it.

306
00:21:23,991 --> 00:21:25,450
We could try a truth serum,

307
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:30,080
but it could take weeks
to synthesize the correct formula.

308
00:21:30,163 --> 00:21:33,709
I've been studying Xindi neurophysiology.

309
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:37,421
It may be possible to erase
his most recent memory engrams.

310
00:21:37,504 --> 00:21:40,090
That way,
Degra will never know that he came aboard

311
00:21:40,173 --> 00:21:42,217
or that he met any of us.

312
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:44,845
But this is a Xindi-Reptilian.

313
00:21:44,928 --> 00:21:46,430
Would it work on a primate?

314
00:21:48,056 --> 00:21:50,809
Their neural pathways
are virtually identical.

315
00:21:50,892 --> 00:21:52,436
I'll need to perform a few tests,

316
00:21:52,519 --> 00:21:54,688
but, uh, I don't expect
it will be a problem.

317
00:21:54,771 --> 00:21:58,108
How selective could this memory wipe be?

318
00:21:58,191 --> 00:22:00,110
I've built flight simulators
for Starfleet training.

319
00:22:00,193 --> 00:22:02,029
This wouldn't be that different.

320
00:22:02,112 --> 00:22:04,239
It's not simply a matter
of constructing a shuttle.

321
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:05,824
It has to be designed.

322
00:22:05,907 --> 00:22:07,326
What species built it?

323
00:22:07,409 --> 00:22:09,202
What language will
the control interface use?

324
00:22:09,286 --> 00:22:10,954
Hoshi can help with that.

325
00:22:11,038 --> 00:22:14,041
I've recovered a letter Degra wrote
to his wife a few months ago.

326
00:22:14,124 --> 00:22:16,877
Her name's Naara. They have two children.

327
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,837
It may be necessary
to communicate with you

328
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,464
while you're inside the simulator.

329
00:22:20,547 --> 00:22:23,633
The Macos use subdermal transceivers.

330
00:22:23,717 --> 00:22:25,719
They're relatively easy to implant.

331
00:22:27,054 --> 00:22:29,097
Let's get started.

332
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:31,850
T'Pol, I could use your help
with some of the details.

333
00:22:31,933 --> 00:22:33,518
Details?

334
00:22:33,602 --> 00:22:35,145
If he buys into this,
Degra's gonna want to know

335
00:22:35,228 --> 00:22:37,481
everything that's happened
in the last three years.

336
00:22:37,564 --> 00:22:40,233
I can't make up the whole story
on the spot.

337
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:50,452
Nice work.

338
00:22:50,535 --> 00:22:51,912
Thank you.

339
00:22:51,995 --> 00:22:54,498
Dermal art used to be
very common on Denobula.

340
00:22:54,581 --> 00:22:57,751
Fortunately,
my parents insisted I study it.

341
00:22:57,834 --> 00:23:01,421
Ah...
I've also stimulated his hair follicles.

342
00:23:02,714 --> 00:23:05,342
I'm not sure about the gray.

343
00:23:05,425 --> 00:23:07,719
This is only supposed to be
three years from now.

344
00:23:07,803 --> 00:23:09,262
Ah, but you're forgetting about

345
00:23:09,346 --> 00:23:12,140
the stress of imprisonment,
hmm, and torture!

346
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:15,435
It could very well have
an effect on hair pigmentation.

347
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:25,821
-You're sure these are safe?
-Oh, yes.

348
00:23:25,904 --> 00:23:30,951
I've treated patients with
Regulan bloodworms for years.

349
00:23:31,034 --> 00:23:32,410
There should be no side effects

350
00:23:32,494 --> 00:23:36,289
aside from a thoroughly cleansed
lymphatic system.

351
00:23:36,373 --> 00:23:39,376
Please try not to injure it.
They're difficult to replace.

352
00:23:39,459 --> 00:23:41,336
I'll do my best.

353
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:52,389
( rumbling, alarm beeping )

354
00:23:54,516 --> 00:23:55,892
What is it?

355
00:23:55,976 --> 00:23:57,352
Spatial anomalies.

356
00:23:57,435 --> 00:23:59,437
We're passing through a field of them.

357
00:24:01,148 --> 00:24:02,149
Hold on!

358
00:24:05,485 --> 00:24:06,987
T'Pol to cargo bay 2.

359
00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:09,948
<i>Increase hydraulics to level 6.</i>

360
00:24:13,326 --> 00:24:16,329
-Is the hull lined with trellium?
-Obviously not.

361
00:24:18,456 --> 00:24:19,666
Increase to level 7.

362
00:24:20,959 --> 00:24:24,171
<i>On my mark,</i>
<i>initiate a sharp jolt to starboard.</i>

363
00:24:24,254 --> 00:24:26,965
How sharp do you want it?

364
00:24:27,048 --> 00:24:28,258
Sharp.

365
00:24:29,885 --> 00:24:31,386
You heard the lady.

366
00:24:31,469 --> 00:24:32,971
T'POL: Let the Captain know.

367
00:24:34,264 --> 00:24:36,766
This is gonna be a rough one, sir.

368
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:40,270
-( rumbling continues )
-( groaning )

369
00:24:44,274 --> 00:24:46,818
We're losing structural integrity!

370
00:24:46,902 --> 00:24:48,737
I'm taking us out of warp.

371
00:24:54,326 --> 00:24:55,368
( breathing heavily )

372
00:24:57,537 --> 00:24:59,581
We'll never make it through
this field in one piece.

373
00:25:03,335 --> 00:25:05,128
Can we go around?

374
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:08,590
We don't have enough fuel.

375
00:25:12,469 --> 00:25:14,429
We should send a distress call.

376
00:25:15,972 --> 00:25:18,725
One of your ships might be
close enough to hear it.

377
00:25:18,808 --> 00:25:20,435
What if the Insectoids pick it up?

378
00:25:22,395 --> 00:25:24,147
We don't have a lot of choices.

379
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:29,778
There's a com channel used by
high-ranking primate officials.

380
00:25:29,861 --> 00:25:32,280
I doubt the Insectoids know it.

381
00:25:33,531 --> 00:25:35,367
What's the frequency?

382
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:37,953
It would be easier for me
to enter it directly.

383
00:25:49,339 --> 00:25:50,590
Ensign?

384
00:25:55,428 --> 00:25:57,681
-I've got it.
-Stand by to respond.

385
00:25:57,764 --> 00:26:00,267
-( communicator beeps )
-MALCOLM: <i>Bridge to command center.</i>

386
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:03,144
-Go ahead.
-I'm picking up a distortion in subspace.

387
00:26:03,228 --> 00:26:04,688
I believe it's a Xindi ship.

388
00:26:04,771 --> 00:26:07,357
-How long until they arrive?
-About six hours.

389
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:10,819
Their sensors are pretty sophisticated.
They might see us long before then.

390
00:26:12,237 --> 00:26:15,615
Lieutenant,
take us back into the debris field.

391
00:26:15,699 --> 00:26:18,076
MALCOLM: <i>The radiation could overload</i>
<i>our systems again.</i>

392
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:19,577
I'm aware of the risks.

393
00:26:21,288 --> 00:26:22,580
Carry out my orders.

394
00:26:22,664 --> 00:26:24,165
<i>Acknowledged.</i>

395
00:26:28,169 --> 00:26:30,297
( exhales )

396
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:34,718
One of the inmates told me
all about Maarek III.

397
00:26:35,802 --> 00:26:39,180
He used it as a staging area
when he was smuggling dilithium.

398
00:26:39,264 --> 00:26:41,016
What did he say it was like?

399
00:26:41,099 --> 00:26:42,726
( sighs )

400
00:26:42,809 --> 00:26:44,352
Beautiful.

401
00:26:45,145 --> 00:26:48,148
With beaches that go on
for thousands of kilometers.

402
00:26:51,109 --> 00:26:55,363
First thing I'm gonna do
is find a cold lake

403
00:26:55,447 --> 00:26:58,158
and take the longest bath of my life.

404
00:27:01,244 --> 00:27:04,539
<i>It sounded a lot like Earth,</i>
<i>the way he described it.</i>

405
00:27:09,711 --> 00:27:11,838
The Captain's certainly drinking a lot.

406
00:27:11,921 --> 00:27:15,133
The doctor gave him an anti-intoxicant.

407
00:27:15,216 --> 00:27:19,054
<i>This colony of yours,</i>
<i>you never told me about it.</i>

408
00:27:19,137 --> 00:27:20,722
<i>It was bleak, desolate.</i>

409
00:27:20,805 --> 00:27:22,557
The planet was barely habitable.

410
00:27:22,891 --> 00:27:24,768
Why'd you live there?

411
00:27:24,851 --> 00:27:27,020
It wasn't by choice.

412
00:27:28,104 --> 00:27:29,606
Naara was desperate to leave.

413
00:27:29,689 --> 00:27:31,358
She didn't think a military habitat

414
00:27:31,441 --> 00:27:34,486
was the right environment
for the children.

415
00:27:34,569 --> 00:27:38,823
Do you have a family, Captain?

416
00:27:42,035 --> 00:27:44,954
It's been a long time since
anyone called me "Captain."

417
00:27:45,038 --> 00:27:48,124
It's Jonathan, remember?

418
00:27:48,208 --> 00:27:51,086
I never really had an opportunity
to start one.

419
00:27:53,254 --> 00:27:54,964
I was away from home a lot.

420
00:27:56,508 --> 00:27:58,551
You should make the time.

421
00:27:59,719 --> 00:28:03,223
I've learned that our work,
in the end, means very little.

422
00:28:04,474 --> 00:28:06,643
Our real legacy is the children.

423
00:28:10,271 --> 00:28:13,441
I would do anything to protect mine.

424
00:28:15,819 --> 00:28:21,282
After I was told of the threat
from humanity...

425
00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:26,287
I left my theoretical studies
and agreed to design the prototype weapon.

426
00:28:27,205 --> 00:28:29,707
When it arrived in your star system,

427
00:28:30,792 --> 00:28:34,129
I watched the incoming telemetry
with the other members of the Council.

428
00:28:35,922 --> 00:28:38,174
Seven million lives...

429
00:28:40,051 --> 00:28:42,554
Were extinguished in front of my eyes.

430
00:28:43,513 --> 00:28:49,436
I asked myself,
how many of those were children?

431
00:28:53,857 --> 00:28:55,775
I suppose I've told you this before.

432
00:28:59,529 --> 00:29:00,947
Actually, you haven't.

433
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:03,241
Three years!

434
00:29:03,324 --> 00:29:06,536
My children may not even
recognize me after so much.

435
00:29:06,619 --> 00:29:08,496
( beeping )

436
00:29:16,337 --> 00:29:18,089
We're being hailed.

437
00:29:18,173 --> 00:29:20,341
( static )

438
00:29:20,425 --> 00:29:24,095
Whoever it is,
they must be pretty far away.

439
00:29:24,179 --> 00:29:26,306
I'll try to clear it up.

440
00:29:26,389 --> 00:29:28,767
HOSHI (AS THALEN):<i> </i>
<i>Are you receiving this transmission?</i>

441
00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:31,394
<i>This is Thalen,</i>
<i>responding to your distress call.</i>

442
00:29:31,478 --> 00:29:32,645
<i>Please acknowledge.</i>

443
00:29:32,729 --> 00:29:35,148
It's one of my colleagues.

444
00:29:35,231 --> 00:29:38,651
Thalen! Can you hear me? It's Degra!

445
00:29:38,735 --> 00:29:41,404
<i>Degra? It's good to hear your voice.</i>

446
00:29:41,488 --> 00:29:42,906
<i>I'd... I'd heard from my sources</i>

447
00:29:42,989 --> 00:29:45,992
that you'd been captured
by the Insectoids.

448
00:29:46,075 --> 00:29:48,661
There were reports
that you had been executed.

449
00:29:48,745 --> 00:29:51,289
DEGRA: <i>They haven't killed me yet.</i>
<i>I need your help.</i>

450
00:29:51,372 --> 00:29:53,917
My friend and I have escaped
from an Insectoid prison.

451
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,169
Their patrols are looking for us.

452
00:29:56,252 --> 00:29:59,547
HOSHI:<i> Uh, I'm losing your signal. </i>
<i>Please repeat.</i>

453
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:00,882
ARCHER: Better make it fast!

454
00:30:02,091 --> 00:30:05,011
Thalen, where are you?

455
00:30:05,094 --> 00:30:08,348
<i>I'm on Azati Prime.</i>
<i>It... It... It's safe here.</i>

456
00:30:08,431 --> 00:30:10,850
Is my family still there? Are they safe?

457
00:30:10,934 --> 00:30:12,060
( static )

458
00:30:12,143 --> 00:30:13,520
Thalen!

459
00:30:13,603 --> 00:30:16,648
<i>Naara is here and the children.</i>

460
00:30:16,731 --> 00:30:18,983
<i>I'll... I'll tell them to expect you.</i>

461
00:30:19,067 --> 00:30:20,777
( static )

462
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:23,404
( line disconnects )

463
00:30:25,573 --> 00:30:27,075
At least you know they're all right.

464
00:30:27,158 --> 00:30:31,287
There were more than 1,000 primates
and Arboreals at that colony.

465
00:30:31,371 --> 00:30:33,540
I don't understand
why it wasn't destroyed.

466
00:30:33,623 --> 00:30:38,044
<i>We should still change course.</i>
<i>Do you know the coordinates?</i>

467
00:30:42,549 --> 00:30:44,092
What's wrong?

468
00:30:44,175 --> 00:30:45,885
You must forgive me.

469
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:49,931
To me, it's been only a day
since we were enemies.

470
00:30:50,014 --> 00:30:52,475
Giving you the coordinates
to a classified installation

471
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:55,228
is... difficult.

472
00:30:56,104 --> 00:30:57,856
Be my guest.

473
00:31:03,027 --> 00:31:04,153
They're coming in.

474
00:31:04,237 --> 00:31:08,449
1127.4 by 4052...

475
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:11,870
by 3901.1.

476
00:31:11,953 --> 00:31:13,037
( beeping )

477
00:31:14,247 --> 00:31:15,790
A Red Giant.

478
00:31:15,874 --> 00:31:17,375
Open a com line to the Captain.

479
00:31:22,213 --> 00:31:25,341
You encrypted the navigation controls.

480
00:31:25,425 --> 00:31:26,593
Yes.

481
00:31:26,676 --> 00:31:31,180
T'POL: <i>Captain, the coordinates match</i>
<i>the location of one of the Red Giants.</i>

482
00:31:31,264 --> 00:31:34,183
Do you mind if I ask how long
it will take to get there?

483
00:31:34,267 --> 00:31:36,477
( sighs ) Not long.

484
00:31:36,561 --> 00:31:38,855
T'POL: <i>Approximately three weeks </i>
<i>at maximum warp.</i>

485
00:31:38,938 --> 00:31:41,608
A considerable detour
if the weapon isn't there.

486
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:54,996
What will your people think
when you show up with me?

487
00:31:56,706 --> 00:31:59,834
Humans probably aren't
their favorite species.

488
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:02,420
I'll tell them everything
you did to help me.

489
00:32:02,503 --> 00:32:05,381
I'm a senior official.
There won't be any problems.

490
00:32:08,384 --> 00:32:09,552
I appreciate that.

491
00:32:09,636 --> 00:32:11,638
It's a diverse community.

492
00:32:11,721 --> 00:32:14,098
Far more pleasant than most military--

493
00:32:14,182 --> 00:32:16,476
( rumbling )

494
00:32:18,728 --> 00:32:22,190
-Travis?
-The port hydraulics are acting up.

495
00:32:28,404 --> 00:32:29,864
Shut them down.

496
00:32:32,784 --> 00:32:34,202
They're not responding.

497
00:32:34,285 --> 00:32:36,537
( over communicator )
<i>T'Pol to cargo bay 2. Report.</i>

498
00:32:36,621 --> 00:32:40,375
The radiation from the debris
is overloading the hydraulic system.

499
00:32:40,458 --> 00:32:42,001
Can you stabilize the simulator?

500
00:32:42,085 --> 00:32:43,086
TUCKER: <i>I'm working on it.</i>

501
00:32:43,169 --> 00:32:45,797
-More anomalies?
-I'm not sure.

502
00:32:46,297 --> 00:32:48,591
Captain, we're having some problems.
Stand by.

503
00:32:50,969 --> 00:32:53,930
T'Pol to the bridge.
Take us out of the debris field.

504
00:32:54,013 --> 00:32:55,014
MALCOLM: <i>Understood.</i>

505
00:33:11,781 --> 00:33:14,033
-( beep )
-MALCOLM: <i>Bridge to the command center.</i>

506
00:33:14,117 --> 00:33:16,285
<i>We're clear of the debris field.</i>

507
00:33:16,369 --> 00:33:17,537
Acknowledged.

508
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:19,706
What was the problem?

509
00:33:19,789 --> 00:33:21,499
Subspace turbulence.

510
00:33:22,208 --> 00:33:23,209
Really?

511
00:33:29,298 --> 00:33:32,927
I'm curious... Jonathan.

512
00:33:35,471 --> 00:33:38,891
If we've been friends
for as long as you say,

513
00:33:38,975 --> 00:33:41,769
I must have told you
the names of my children.

514
00:33:41,853 --> 00:33:44,063
<i>You still don't believe me, do you?</i>

515
00:33:44,147 --> 00:33:45,732
There's something in his hand.

516
00:33:45,815 --> 00:33:47,525
Magnify.

517
00:33:47,608 --> 00:33:49,944
<i>It's been years </i>
<i>since you've said anything.</i>

518
00:33:50,028 --> 00:33:51,654
Captain, he has a weapon.

519
00:33:51,738 --> 00:33:55,533
I just need you to tell me
what their names are.

520
00:33:55,616 --> 00:33:56,909
We're coming in.

521
00:33:56,993 --> 00:33:59,662
<i>This isn't necessary.</i>

522
00:33:59,746 --> 00:34:00,997
Piral and Jaina.

523
00:34:02,707 --> 00:34:04,000
Piral and Jaina.

524
00:34:06,544 --> 00:34:07,795
Which one is older?

525
00:34:12,091 --> 00:34:13,217
It's not in here, sir.

526
00:34:13,301 --> 00:34:14,260
( scoffs )

527
00:34:16,763 --> 00:34:18,306
( both grunting )

528
00:34:21,184 --> 00:34:22,727
( grunts )

529
00:34:35,656 --> 00:34:38,076
You'll never find the weapon.

530
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:39,952
Take him to the brig.

531
00:34:45,666 --> 00:34:47,710
( panting )

532
00:34:56,052 --> 00:34:57,929
( door opens )

533
00:35:00,556 --> 00:35:03,392
We were told humans were ruthless.

534
00:35:03,476 --> 00:35:07,563
But I didn't know you were
also skilled at deception.

535
00:35:07,647 --> 00:35:09,315
When did you realize?

536
00:35:09,398 --> 00:35:12,527
I had my suspicions from the beginning,

537
00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:16,656
but it was the com signal
from my colleague on Azati Prime

538
00:35:16,739 --> 00:35:18,074
that confirmed them.

539
00:35:18,157 --> 00:35:20,743
We know your ship has been there...

540
00:35:20,827 --> 00:35:21,828
Recently.

541
00:35:22,537 --> 00:35:26,958
There's an insectoid deuterium
facility on Azati Prime.

542
00:35:27,041 --> 00:35:29,377
That's the last place
my people would have gone

543
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:30,837
to hide from them.

544
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:35,299
If it weren't for that one mistake,
your plan might have succeeded.

545
00:35:35,383 --> 00:35:37,927
You gave us the coordinates
of a Red Giant.

546
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:41,848
I gave you...

547
00:35:41,931 --> 00:35:45,935
what you thought you wanted.

548
00:35:49,605 --> 00:35:52,441
I guess I'll just have
to wipe your memory clean again.

549
00:35:52,525 --> 00:35:55,903
Go back into the simulator
and start this whole thing over.

550
00:35:56,154 --> 00:35:58,156
I doubt there's time for that.

551
00:35:58,239 --> 00:36:00,616
We both know my people
are searching for me.

552
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:03,870
I think you didn't figure it out
until after the malfunction.

553
00:36:05,121 --> 00:36:08,666
I'd be willing to bet
those coordinates are real.

554
00:36:09,208 --> 00:36:14,130
Then I suggest you proceed there
at maximum warp!

555
00:36:14,213 --> 00:36:17,091
Why would he encrypt the coordinates
if they weren't accurate?

556
00:36:17,175 --> 00:36:19,760
Perhaps he thought it would make
them appear more convincing.

557
00:36:19,844 --> 00:36:21,804
He's got to be lyin', sir.

558
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:23,681
Something must have happened
during the radiation surge

559
00:36:23,764 --> 00:36:25,725
that tipped him off.

560
00:36:26,601 --> 00:36:29,729
We can't afford to lose three weeks
if the weapon isn't there.

561
00:36:32,565 --> 00:36:36,235
Have you learned anything more
about how they open the subspace vortices?

562
00:36:36,319 --> 00:36:39,238
They use some kind of
phase deflector pulses.

563
00:36:39,322 --> 00:36:42,742
Once they're in, their ships can travel
half a dozen light-years

564
00:36:42,825 --> 00:36:44,327
in a couple of minutes.

565
00:36:46,704 --> 00:36:49,290
I want to see all the data
you've collected.

566
00:37:00,843 --> 00:37:02,428
-( beep )
-Archer to the bridge.

567
00:37:02,511 --> 00:37:03,512
<i>We're ready.</i>

568
00:37:04,722 --> 00:37:06,140
Tactical alert.

569
00:37:08,684 --> 00:37:09,894
Engage.

570
00:37:14,023 --> 00:37:15,358
( rumbling )

571
00:37:33,042 --> 00:37:34,168
Open it.

572
00:37:34,252 --> 00:37:35,253
Sir.

573
00:37:39,215 --> 00:37:41,050
You two, come with me.

574
00:37:41,133 --> 00:37:42,885
I said move!

575
00:37:46,806 --> 00:37:49,475
We'll fracture the hull
if this goes on any longer.

576
00:37:53,646 --> 00:37:55,648
FEMALE: <i>Hull breaches </i>
<i>on decks "D" and "E."</i>

577
00:37:55,731 --> 00:37:57,275
Emergency bulkheads!

578
00:37:57,358 --> 00:37:59,151
-You're the engineer?
-Yes.

579
00:37:59,235 --> 00:38:00,319
You're gonna help us.

580
00:38:00,403 --> 00:38:02,238
We adapted your technology,

581
00:38:02,321 --> 00:38:04,282
used our main deflector
to open a subspace vortex.

582
00:38:04,365 --> 00:38:05,950
That's impossible.

583
00:38:07,451 --> 00:38:11,664
The vortex is starting to collapse.
I need you to stabilize it.

584
00:38:11,747 --> 00:38:14,500
If you don't do what he says,
this ship will break apart.

585
00:38:19,505 --> 00:38:20,840
Lieutenant!

586
00:38:22,341 --> 00:38:24,302
Tell him to do what he's told.

587
00:38:24,385 --> 00:38:26,470
Do nothing to help them!

588
00:38:28,889 --> 00:38:30,224
The pylons are buckling!

589
00:38:33,227 --> 00:38:36,188
HOSHI: <i>Engineering, </i>
<i>we're losing hull integrity.</i>

590
00:38:36,272 --> 00:38:39,191
( alarm beeping )

591
00:38:49,452 --> 00:38:51,162
( panting )

592
00:38:51,245 --> 00:38:53,039
Trip!

593
00:38:53,122 --> 00:38:54,582
It wasn't me, Captain.

594
00:38:55,458 --> 00:38:57,418
-( beeping )
-I'll be damned.

595
00:38:58,544 --> 00:39:00,588
Travis inverted the warp field.

596
00:39:01,339 --> 00:39:03,466
It dropped us back into normal space.

597
00:39:03,549 --> 00:39:05,634
( over communicator )
<i>T'Pol to Captain Archer.</i>

598
00:39:05,718 --> 00:39:06,886
Go ahead.

599
00:39:06,969 --> 00:39:08,637
<i>Please report to the bridge.</i>

600
00:39:12,141 --> 00:39:14,101
Take him back to the brig.

601
00:39:24,403 --> 00:39:25,488
Report.

602
00:39:25,571 --> 00:39:28,866
We've reached the coordinates.
Ensign, magnify.

603
00:39:33,245 --> 00:39:35,748
I'm picking up several Xindi vessels.

604
00:39:35,831 --> 00:39:38,334
I'm also reading significant quantities
of Kemocite.

605
00:39:38,417 --> 00:39:40,586
What's our status?

606
00:39:40,669 --> 00:39:42,296
Minimal damage.

607
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:44,757
The hull plating is coming back online.

608
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:46,008
Arm all weapons.

609
00:39:47,009 --> 00:39:49,762
Lay in a course
for those Kemocite signatures.

610
00:39:49,845 --> 00:39:51,430
Full impulse.

611
00:39:54,392 --> 00:39:56,477
Get him out of here.

612
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:58,646
You'll never get close to the weapon!

613
00:39:58,729 --> 00:40:01,607
Our defense perimeter will destroy you!

614
00:40:16,789 --> 00:40:17,832
Show him.

615
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:29,510
Thanks for your help.

616
00:40:29,593 --> 00:40:31,595
Take him to sick bay.

617
00:40:47,278 --> 00:40:48,446
( sighs )

618
00:40:49,864 --> 00:40:52,616
I think you overdid the turbulence
just a little, Ensign.

619
00:40:53,701 --> 00:40:55,744
I'll try to do better next time, sir.

620
00:41:08,007 --> 00:41:09,842
How's it coming?

621
00:41:09,925 --> 00:41:12,887
We've made it appear as if
a plasma conduit ruptured,

622
00:41:13,762 --> 00:41:15,514
rendering them unconscious.

623
00:41:15,598 --> 00:41:18,434
I'm injecting them with
trace amounts of the plasma.

624
00:41:18,517 --> 00:41:20,144
It won't be harmful.

625
00:41:21,687 --> 00:41:25,191
This accident won't explain how
their computer core was deleted.

626
00:41:25,274 --> 00:41:29,487
As long as they don't know we were here,
we can leave them with a mystery.

627
00:41:29,570 --> 00:41:31,655
-( communicator beeps )
-Go ahead.

628
00:41:31,739 --> 00:41:34,450
MALCOLM: <i>The Xindi vessel</i>
<i>is less than an hour away, sir.</i>

629
00:41:37,578 --> 00:41:40,080
ARCHER: <i>Captain's starlog, supplemental.</i>

630
00:41:40,164 --> 00:41:42,249
<i>Hopefully the journey to Azati Prime</i>

631
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:45,169
<i>will be the final leg in our search</i>
<i>for the Xindi weapon.</i>
