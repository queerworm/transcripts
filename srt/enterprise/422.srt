00:00:01,501 --> 00:00:03,128
When are they expecting you in Brazil?

2
00:00:03,586 --> 00:00:05,672
I told them a couple weeks
after the ceremony.

3
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:08,842
With all the receptions,
and then I'll need at least a week

4
00:00:08,925 --> 00:00:10,510
to clear up the linguistic database.

5
00:00:10,844 --> 00:00:12,387
After 10 years on this ship,

6
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:15,473
I bet it'll take a while getting
used to the humidity again.

7
00:00:15,557 --> 00:00:16,391
And the bugs.

8
00:00:17,434 --> 00:00:19,269
Does the captain have to give a speech?

9
00:00:19,477 --> 00:00:20,854
He's working on it now.

10
00:00:21,312 --> 00:00:23,064
He hates giving speeches.

11
00:00:23,148 --> 00:00:26,276
He'll undoubtedly make every
effort to take no credit.

12
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:27,527
Undoubtedly.

13
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:30,530
That'd be like zefram cochrane
not taking credit for warp drive.

14
00:00:31,239 --> 00:00:34,242
How do you pronounce the name
of the second tellarite liberator?

15
00:00:34,617 --> 00:00:36,870
-Challash?
-Shallash.

16
00:00:37,328 --> 00:00:38,913
Shallash. Thanks.

17
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:40,040
How's it going, sir?

18
00:00:40,165 --> 00:00:40,999
Whatever I write,

19
00:00:41,082 --> 00:00:42,542
it sounds like I'm trying
to take credit for this.

20
00:00:43,084 --> 00:00:47,213
Captain, Admiral Douglas is asking you
to approve the decommission protocols.

21
00:00:47,422 --> 00:00:49,758
One thing at a time.
After the charter's signed,

22
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:52,635
I'll give him whatever he needs
to put <i>Enterprise </i>in mothballs.

55
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:07,729
{\an8}If it's a question
of breaking a promise...

56
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:09,856
{\an8}Not a promise. An order.

57
00:03:10,148 --> 00:03:12,775
{\an8}Have you learned anything
on the holodeck about breaking orders?

58
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:14,027
{\an8}Not yet.

59
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:16,279
{\an8}I've gone back a couple of days
earlier to get a perspective.

how this is gonna help.

{\an8}Maybe the program's off.

64
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:29,125
{\an8}No, I'm sure it's fine.

65
00:03:29,208 --> 00:03:30,960
{\an8}It's just, you expect

-Not yet.

68

{\an8}You might want to leap ahead
to that point.

69
00:03:36,925 --> 00:03:38,426
{\an8}It's where things start really happening.

70
00:03:38,509 --> 00:03:40,887
{\an8}And you should consider
taking over the galley.

71
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:41,888
{\an8}Why?

72
00:03:42,013 --> 00:03:44,641
{\an8}Well, Starfleet ships didn't
have counselors in those days,

73
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:47,977
{\an8}But the chef on the first
<i>Enterprise </i>came pretty close.

74
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:50,688
{\an8}I read almost everybody confided in him.

75
00:03:50,772 --> 00:03:52,106
{\an8}I'll keep that in mind.

I still don't understand why you left.
You were a hero.

A hero with a family.

112
00:05:42,258 --> 00:05:46,012
I always believed
that change was a good thing.

00:05:46,095 --> 00:05:47,221

They think I took something
that belonged to them.

118
00:06:01,444 --> 00:06:04,405
With the help of some old
colleagues from the guard,

119
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:06,783
I managed to make myself disappear.

120
00:06:07,116 --> 00:06:10,620

-Six months ago.

00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:33,684
They say if I don't return
what's theirs, they'll kill her.

128
00:06:34,268 --> 00:06:35,937
Then give them what they want.

129
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:38,564
I don't have it! I never did.

130
00:06:39,357 --> 00:06:40,858
But you have a plan.

131
00:06:41,776 --> 00:06:44,112
[Shran] It cost me everything I had,

132
00:06:44,195 --> 00:06:47,115
but I managed to find out
where they've taken her.

133
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:50,034
They're on a trading outpost, Rigel X.

134
00:06:50,535 --> 00:06:53,746
-I'm familiar with it.
-I know these men quite well, Captain.

135
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:57,917
I can outwit them. I've done it before.
But I'll need at least seven men.

136
00:06:58,543 --> 00:07:03,422
You have to help me. It's my little girl.

137
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:06,259
He's an admitted criminal.
You said so yourself.

138
00:07:06,634 --> 00:07:08,845
He said he fell in
with some disreputable people.

139
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:10,346
That doesn't make him a criminal.

140
00:07:10,471 --> 00:07:13,224
If we're late for the ceremony,
it'll have far-reaching consequences.

141
00:07:13,307 --> 00:07:14,767
If Shran hadn't helped us,

142
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:16,602
I never would have gotten aboard
the Xindi weapon.

143
00:07:16,686 --> 00:07:17,854
Have you forgotten that?

144
00:07:18,062 --> 00:07:20,731
This alliance is based
on friendship and loyalty,

145
00:07:20,898 --> 00:07:22,817
exactly what Shran is
looking for right now.

146
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:23,734
I don't trust him.

147
00:07:23,901 --> 00:07:25,653
You don't trust Andorians. You never have.

148
00:07:25,987 --> 00:07:29,198
Thank god the Vulcan council
is a little more enlightened than you are.

149
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:31,033
If they're willing to forge
an alliance with Andoria,

150
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:33,494
the least you can do is give
Shran the benefit of the doubt.

151
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:38,082
When we met 10 years ago,
I didn't trust you.

152
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,461
For that matter,
I didn't trust any Vulcans.

153
00:07:41,544 --> 00:07:44,172
You helped me get past that, remember?

154
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:47,967
I listened to you.
Now it's your turn to listen to me.

155
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:50,470
I can't turn my back on him, T'pol.

-Try to understand.
-I'll try.

Drop by the galley when you get a moment.

Chef's trying to come up with a menu
for our last dinner together.

160
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:06,986
He wants to know
everybody's favorite dish.

161
00:08:07,361 --> 00:08:09,655
[T'pol] There are 83 crew members aboard.

162
00:08:09,864 --> 00:08:11,240

164
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:17,663
[Archer] Don't worry.

165
00:08:18,206 --> 00:08:20,917
Chef's promised
at least six kinds of cheese.

166
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:24,128
[T'pol] I appreciate the gesture,

167
00:08:24,253 --> 00:08:27,340
but it's not necessary to
prepare a special dish for me.

168
00:08:27,632 --> 00:08:28,466
Come on.

169
00:08:29,217 --> 00:08:31,260
I've already started to reduce
the plomeek broth.

170
00:08:31,928 --> 00:08:34,388
All I need to know is
which roots you prefer.

171
00:08:34,722 --> 00:08:37,141
In that case, I prefer to be surprised.

172
00:08:37,391 --> 00:08:39,769
Pull up a chair. I could use the company.

173
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:45,525
I heard a rumor I may be whipping up
some Andorian cabbage soup tonight.

174
00:08:45,858 --> 00:08:49,237
We have already lost five hours
picking up Shran's shuttle.

175
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,072
Now we're going to lose
at least another day

176
00:08:51,155 --> 00:08:53,115
diverting our course to Rigel.

177
00:08:53,282 --> 00:08:54,659
His child's in danger.

178
00:08:55,785 --> 00:08:58,120
Is there anything aboard
this ship you don't know?

179
00:08:58,663 --> 00:09:01,749
Jonathan is a compassionate man.
You should know that by now.

180
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:05,836
His compassion has gotten us
into trouble on many occasions.

181
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:08,214
We could miss this ceremony.

182
00:09:08,297 --> 00:09:10,925
Don't worry. I've got a hunch
you're gonna make it.

183
00:09:11,008 --> 00:09:12,927
-Tea?
-Thank you.

184
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:17,181
Phlox has given me his largest
Edosian suckerfish.

185
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:18,891
Excuse me?

186
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:22,562
Looks like a catfish.
I'm hoping it tastes like one.

187
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:25,648
Commander Tucker's crazy for catfish.

188
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,608
Do you ever miss him?

189
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:31,070
I spent the morning with him,
recalibrating the plasma array.

190
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:32,113
That's not what I mean.

191
00:09:32,947 --> 00:09:36,158
If you're referring
to our intimate relationship,

192
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:37,994
that's been over for six years.

193
00:09:38,119 --> 00:09:40,454
But the question remains, do you miss him?

194
00:09:40,538 --> 00:09:43,291
I'm Vulcan. I don't miss people.

195
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:45,501
Sorry. I forgot.

196
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:48,212
Is he as concerned as you
about making this ceremony?

197
00:09:48,296 --> 00:09:50,506
Trip rarely questions
the Captain's decisions.

198
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:53,676
He doesn't strike me as someone
who follows orders blindly.

199
00:09:54,343 --> 00:09:55,177
He's not.

200
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:58,097
He simply tends to agree with
the Captain most of the time.

201
00:09:58,180 --> 00:09:59,140
He trusts him.

202
00:10:01,517 --> 00:10:02,560
Would you peel these for me?

203
00:10:07,773 --> 00:10:09,066
Before I joined this crew,

204
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:12,278
I never could have imagined anything
more important than following orders.

205
00:10:12,361 --> 00:10:13,195
And now?

206
00:10:14,989 --> 00:10:18,909
Humans believe that sometimes
you have to follow your instincts.

207
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:23,789
Very illogical approach,
but one I've come to embrace.

208
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:28,294
-Computer, freeze program.
-[computer beeps]

209
00:10:29,587 --> 00:10:30,588
Thanks.

210
00:10:42,016 --> 00:10:43,559
[beeping]

211
00:10:52,777 --> 00:10:53,778
[door opens]

212
00:10:54,278 --> 00:10:55,488
There you are.

213
00:10:57,073 --> 00:10:58,199
Someone you know?

214
00:10:58,491 --> 00:10:59,450
Someone I knew.

215
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:01,535
<i>Pegasus?</i>

216
00:11:01,827 --> 00:11:05,164
Phil Wallace. Hell of a handball player.

217
00:11:05,247 --> 00:11:07,124
Pressman was getting ready to promote him.

218
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:09,001
How many died?

219
00:11:09,877 --> 00:11:12,505
Seventy one. All but nine of us.

220
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,716
How do you feel about learning
the ship wasn't destroyed?

221
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:18,594
What difference does it make?
71 people died.

222
00:11:20,471 --> 00:11:22,014
You're feeling guilty.

223
00:11:23,224 --> 00:11:25,810
You think, in some way,
you were responsible?

224
00:11:25,893 --> 00:11:28,062
You're the empath. Why don't you tell me?

225
00:11:30,064 --> 00:11:33,859
I think it's something else,
something about seeing that ship again.

226
00:11:34,402 --> 00:11:37,321
-Why don't we change the subject? OK?
-OK.

227
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:40,783
How did things go on the holodeck?

228
00:11:41,409 --> 00:11:43,869
They picked up the Andorian.
They're on their way to Rigel X.

229
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:46,580
I was referring to any insight
you may have gained.

230
00:11:46,914 --> 00:11:50,376
I took your advice about the chef.
You were right. T'pol opened up to me.

231
00:11:50,626 --> 00:11:54,422
-Have you met with Commander Tucker?
-No, I haven't made it to Engineering yet.

232
00:11:54,505 --> 00:11:57,758
-Have you spent any time on the NX-01?
-I've never run the program.

233
00:11:57,883 --> 00:11:59,009
What about the ship itself?

234
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:03,639
I think I went when I was a little girl,
but I get all those museum ships mixed up.

235
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:06,308
Now's your chance. Come on down with me.

236
00:12:06,475 --> 00:12:08,018
I have an appointment in an hour.

237
00:12:08,102 --> 00:12:10,354
I'll get you back in plenty of time.
Come on.

238
00:12:12,022 --> 00:12:13,399
Our Brig is bigger than this.

239
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:16,527
A lot of things change in 200 years.
Watch yourself!

240
00:12:16,986 --> 00:12:17,862
No fish tank.

241
00:12:17,945 --> 00:12:20,489
How could archer survive
without a fish tank?

242
00:12:23,117 --> 00:12:24,118
Allow me.

243
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:30,791
He does have a dog, though.

244
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:33,502
Right, I remember. One of the musketeers.

245
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:34,420
Porthos.

246
00:12:35,463 --> 00:12:36,797
Oh, comfy.

247
00:12:36,922 --> 00:12:38,591
No seat for the first officer?

248
00:12:39,049 --> 00:12:42,178
Perhaps, Archer wasn't as fussy
as Captain Picard,

249
00:12:42,303 --> 00:12:44,638
when it came to people
sitting in his chair.

250
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:48,017
[beeping]

251
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:50,478
I remember seeing one of these
in a photograph.

252
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:54,148
Kirk's ship had them, I think.
Engineering's down this way.

253
00:12:54,565 --> 00:12:57,401
There's something lonely about
a ship without its crew.

254
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:00,571
Computer, add an appropriate
crew complement, objective mode.

255
00:13:00,696 --> 00:13:02,072
[beeping]

256
00:13:02,406 --> 00:13:03,657
That's better.

257
00:13:04,825 --> 00:13:09,038
If you recall, Rigel X is filled
with a very unsavory element.

258
00:13:09,246 --> 00:13:12,500
And I rather doubt Shran's scheme
will be quite as simple as he claims.

259
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:14,502
I can't imagine the Captain would put us

260
00:13:14,585 --> 00:13:16,337
in jeopardy this close
to signing the charter.

261
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:18,631
-I don't like it.
-[electronic humming]

262
00:13:19,215 --> 00:13:20,841
What exactly are you doing?

263
00:13:21,258 --> 00:13:24,136
These injectors need to be
purged every six months.

264
00:13:25,137 --> 00:13:27,014
Are the deuterium filters clear?

265
00:13:27,556 --> 00:13:29,475
-We've done all but three.
-All right.

266
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,435
-Make it quick.
-Aye, sir.

267
00:13:32,019 --> 00:13:33,312
Well, what's the point?

268
00:13:33,437 --> 00:13:36,065
This ship will be joining
the mothball fleet next week.

269
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:37,858
I pretty much built this engine.

270
00:13:38,609 --> 00:13:40,819
Plan to take care of it as long as I can.

271
00:13:43,239 --> 00:13:44,448
[sighs]

272
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:48,369
Been a hell of a run, Malcolm.

273
00:13:50,621 --> 00:13:52,665
I never thought it would come to an end.

274
00:13:56,168 --> 00:13:57,628
All good things...

275
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:03,175
Captain thinks there'll be
another <i>Enterprise</i> before too long.

276
00:14:04,134 --> 00:14:05,219
I imagine.

277
00:14:06,136 --> 00:14:07,346
It won't be the same.

278
00:14:11,058 --> 00:14:12,226
That's OK.

279
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:16,230
Come on.

280
00:14:22,778 --> 00:14:24,196
It's sad.

281
00:14:24,488 --> 00:14:27,408
Commander Tucker had no idea
he wouldn't make it back.

282
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:31,579
How reliable are your sources?

283
00:14:31,996 --> 00:14:34,248
[Shran] They're criminals,
but honorable ones.

284
00:14:34,623 --> 00:14:38,419
They promise me that Talla's
being held here. At upper level 4.

285
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:40,462
Have you fashioned the amethyst?

286
00:14:40,588 --> 00:14:43,424
The photograph you gave us
had poor resolution,

287
00:14:43,591 --> 00:14:46,093
but I'm confident our
replication will look authentic.

288
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:49,221
The Teneebian amethyst
they think I stole was flawless.

289
00:14:49,305 --> 00:14:51,515
They'll undoubtedly have
magnifying equipment with them.

290
00:14:51,807 --> 00:14:54,643
They'll need a spectral micrometer
to see it's a fabrication.

291
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:57,521
How many do you expect to show up?

292
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:59,857
-Computer, freeze program.
-[beeping]

293
00:15:02,443 --> 00:15:05,321
-He's cute.
-Don't get any ideas.

294
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:07,323
Reg will be furious if I'm late.

295
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:08,908
-Are you gonna stay?
-[Riker] Yeah, for a little while.

296
00:15:09,116 --> 00:15:11,118
Good luck. Computer, arch.

297
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:18,208
Computer, how long
before they reach Rigel X?

298
00:15:18,292 --> 00:15:20,544
[computer] <i>Sixteen hours, 22 minutes.</i>

299
00:15:20,669 --> 00:15:23,172
Advance to that point.
Stay in objective mode.

300
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:26,050
Move into a stationary orbit.

301
00:15:26,258 --> 00:15:27,176
[Travis] Aye, sir.

302
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:29,219
Put a team together.
Meet us in the launch bay.

303
00:15:29,803 --> 00:15:32,139
[Tucker] Captain,
can I have a word with you?

304
00:15:35,351 --> 00:15:36,894
We can handle this without you.

305
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:39,772
-Well, that's flattering.
-You know what I mean.

306
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:42,524
You've got the biggest day
of your life coming up.

307
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:44,568
A lot of people are counting
on you being there.

308
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:46,320
I appreciate you worrying
about me, but I'll be fine.

309
00:15:46,403 --> 00:15:48,822
You don't need to be putting
yourself in harm's way.

310
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:51,241
I'm telling you, we can take care of it.

311
00:15:51,492 --> 00:15:53,535
Rigel was the first place
we visited, remember?

312
00:15:53,661 --> 00:15:55,079
Now it's gonna be the last.

313
00:15:55,663 --> 00:15:56,872
Poetic justice.

314
00:15:57,581 --> 00:15:59,166
Why should you have all the fun?

315
00:16:05,172 --> 00:16:06,799
We're going through the troposphere.

316
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:08,884
Might get a little bumpy.

317
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:10,844
Have you been down to see chef yet?

318
00:16:11,595 --> 00:16:13,722
First thing this morning. You?

319
00:16:15,182 --> 00:16:16,475
He talked about you.

320
00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:19,269
-Me?
-Us.

321
00:16:19,895 --> 00:16:20,896
[Tucker] What about us?

322
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:24,692
It's not important.

323
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:28,570
[chuckles] Why'd you bring it up, then?

324
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:29,822
[rumbling]

325
00:16:33,534 --> 00:16:34,994
Do you ever miss me?

326
00:16:37,705 --> 00:16:38,998
-You mean...
-Yes.

327
00:16:40,249 --> 00:16:41,959
You know how long it's been?

328
00:16:42,251 --> 00:16:43,669
That's not what I asked you.

329
00:16:45,963 --> 00:16:47,297
Well, um...

330
00:16:49,216 --> 00:16:50,718
Yeah, I guess, sometimes.

331
00:16:54,763 --> 00:16:57,224
I haven't thought about
those days in a long time.

332
00:16:57,307 --> 00:16:58,767
Benefit of being a Vulcan.

333
00:17:00,978 --> 00:17:02,438
After speaking with chef,

334
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:04,314
I realized we may never
see each other again.

335
00:17:04,732 --> 00:17:08,027
-What are you talking about?
-We're taking different assignments.

336
00:17:08,235 --> 00:17:10,696
-There's no way of knowing--
-There's every way of knowing.

337
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:15,993
I can guarantee you
we're not gonna lose touch.

338
00:17:17,786 --> 00:17:18,996
Stop thinking like that.

339
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:27,921
However long it may be,
I believe I'm going to miss you.

340
00:17:30,507 --> 00:17:32,051
[Archer] <i>Archer to Shuttlepod 2.</i>

341
00:17:32,342 --> 00:17:33,218
Go ahead, sir.

342
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:35,512
[Archer] <i>Shran's made contact.</i>
<i>Everything's set.</i>

343
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:37,639
<i>-I'll lead you in.</i>
-Understood.

344
00:17:56,492 --> 00:17:57,534
[Alien] Stop there.

345
00:18:00,662 --> 00:18:01,872
Unless I'm mistaken,

346
00:18:01,955 --> 00:18:05,167
I thought you had no idea
where the amethyst was.

347
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:06,877
Where's my daughter?

348
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,379
Funny how a missing child is
a way to jog the memory,

349
00:18:09,505 --> 00:18:10,339
eh, Shran?

350
00:18:10,422 --> 00:18:11,632
Where is she?

351
00:18:12,007 --> 00:18:13,801
I thought you were happily married.

352
00:18:14,218 --> 00:18:15,677
Who's the Vulcan?

353
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:18,680
I'm not interested in your associates,
so don't question mine.

354
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:20,808
Put the case down and open it.

355
00:18:21,016 --> 00:18:22,768
We want the child first.

356
00:18:23,143 --> 00:18:24,603
I could shoot you both.

357
00:18:24,686 --> 00:18:27,481
You'll never get this case open,
I promise you.

358
00:18:28,524 --> 00:18:31,110
You let a female
negotiate for you, eh, Shran?

359
00:18:31,235 --> 00:18:32,236
You heard her.

360
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:46,166
-Are you all right?
-I'm hungry.

361
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:47,793
Now open the case.

362
00:18:52,589 --> 00:18:54,591
[beeping]

363
00:19:07,563 --> 00:19:08,397
Set it down.

364
00:19:16,405 --> 00:19:17,698
Now back up.

365
00:19:21,577 --> 00:19:23,078
Let her take the girl.

366
00:19:23,453 --> 00:19:25,664
Fine, but you stay.

367
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:29,877
One step, and this little blue beauty
won't have a father to come home to.

368
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:41,096
I want you to go with T'pol.
You'll be safe with her.

369
00:19:42,055 --> 00:19:43,724
She'll find you something to eat.

370
00:19:48,395 --> 00:19:49,771
Obey your father.

371
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:03,619
Now step back.

372
00:20:16,298 --> 00:20:17,382
[beeping]

373
00:20:25,349 --> 00:20:26,433
[beeping]

374
00:20:27,643 --> 00:20:29,603
-What are you doing?
-[beeping]

375
00:20:42,199 --> 00:20:43,283
[screams]

376
00:20:44,952 --> 00:20:47,287
Stand still, and you won't be harmed!

377
00:20:47,371 --> 00:20:48,413
[shouts indistinctly]

378
00:21:12,521 --> 00:21:14,314
Ugh!

379
00:21:22,489 --> 00:21:24,241
Aah!

380
00:21:34,751 --> 00:21:35,669
Hold on!

381
00:21:39,256 --> 00:21:40,132
[grunting]

382
00:21:42,551 --> 00:21:43,635
Thanks, boss.

383
00:21:46,388 --> 00:21:47,431
Anytime.

384
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:59,693
You're certain that it won't be a problem?

385
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:01,194
[Archer] I'll feel more comfortable

386
00:22:01,278 --> 00:22:04,364
getting you away
from your friends at warp 4.

387
00:22:04,698 --> 00:22:06,533
[Shran] My shuttle may be slow,

388
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:08,452
but their ships can barely make warp 2.

389
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:09,786
All the same,

390
00:22:09,911 --> 00:22:11,455
you'll be under your own power
by tomorrow night.

391
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:12,539
We'll contact your wife

392
00:22:12,622 --> 00:22:13,999
and tell her to expect you
the next morning.

393
00:22:14,082 --> 00:22:16,710
I told you my plan would
only take a few hours.

394
00:22:16,793 --> 00:22:17,878
You're welcome.

395
00:22:18,045 --> 00:22:19,338
[chuckles]

396
00:22:19,421 --> 00:22:22,257
You should let phlox take a look at her
before you go to your quarters.

397
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:24,343
Whatever you say, captain.

398
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,219
Thanks, pink-skin.

399
00:22:26,595 --> 00:22:27,596
[chuckles]

400
00:22:30,515 --> 00:22:32,934
You must be getting tired
of saving my life.

401
00:22:33,101 --> 00:22:35,228
I'm glad I didn't take your
advice about not coming along.

402
00:22:35,437 --> 00:22:36,772
Yeah, you and me both.

403
00:22:36,855 --> 00:22:39,232
Then again, you almost got
yourself killed down there.

404
00:22:39,566 --> 00:22:41,735
Wouldn't have gone over
too big at the ceremony.

405
00:22:41,818 --> 00:22:45,030
Signing documents are easy.
Training a new engineer...

406
00:22:45,572 --> 00:22:47,282
that can be a real pain in the ass.

407
00:22:59,836 --> 00:23:01,963
-[communicator beeps]
-[Data]<i> Data to counselor Troi.</i>

408
00:23:02,089 --> 00:23:03,215
Yes, Data?

409
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:05,550
[Data] <i>I was wondering if this might be</i>
<i>an appropriate time</i>

410
00:23:05,717 --> 00:23:08,637
<i>to continue our discussion</i>
<i>on the long-term effects of space travel</i>

411
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,180
<i>on my positronic net.</i>

412
00:23:10,639 --> 00:23:12,390
Can I give you a rain check?

413
00:23:12,599 --> 00:23:15,435
[Data]<i> You may, check me for rain</i>
<i>if you wish, counselor,</i>

414
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:17,062
<i>but I assure you, I have no water in my--</i>

415
00:23:17,145 --> 00:23:18,855
-[door chimes]
-Data, I'll get back to you.

416
00:23:19,106 --> 00:23:20,065
Come in.

417
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:23,568
I know it's past office hours.

418
00:23:23,652 --> 00:23:24,820
What is it?

419
00:23:27,155 --> 00:23:29,116
It won't be long before
they find the <i>Pegasus.</i>

420
00:23:29,324 --> 00:23:31,118
You haven't made your decision.

421
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:33,954
[Troi] The holodeck?

422
00:23:34,037 --> 00:23:35,789
They rescued the Andorian's daughter.

423
00:23:35,872 --> 00:23:38,834
So, you're coming to the moment
of truth in there, as well.

424
00:23:39,167 --> 00:23:41,628
I need you to promise
you'll keep this confidential.

425
00:23:42,587 --> 00:23:43,630
You know I will.

426
00:23:43,713 --> 00:23:45,423
What do you know
about the treaty of Algeron?

427
00:23:45,882 --> 00:23:49,553
2311. It redefined
the Romulan neutral zone.

428
00:23:49,678 --> 00:23:51,721
It also outlawed the use
of cloaking technology

429
00:23:51,805 --> 00:23:53,140
on Starfleet vessels.

430
00:23:54,307 --> 00:23:55,350
The <i>Pegasus?</i>

431
00:23:56,184 --> 00:23:58,854
A secret group in Starfleet
security developed a prototype.

432
00:23:59,521 --> 00:24:01,189
Pressman was put in charge of testing it.

433
00:24:01,982 --> 00:24:04,860
That's why they're so eager to
find it before the Romulans do.

434
00:24:05,026 --> 00:24:07,195
The accident, the 71 people who died...

435
00:24:08,113 --> 00:24:12,159
-We were testing the cloaking device.
-It was covered up.

436
00:24:12,325 --> 00:24:14,953
The nine of us who made it back
alive were sworn to secrecy.

437
00:24:15,704 --> 00:24:17,539
And you've lived with that for 12 years?

438
00:24:17,706 --> 00:24:20,083
And they want to pick the experiment up
where they left off.

439
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:21,626
Are you sure?

440
00:24:22,002 --> 00:24:23,461
Pressman told me himself.

441
00:24:24,754 --> 00:24:26,965
What they're doing is wrong.

442
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:29,176
It could jeopardize the treaty.

443
00:24:31,011 --> 00:24:33,305
And you want to tell that
to Captain Picard.

444
00:24:33,722 --> 00:24:37,309
I took an oath of secrecy.
Pressman still outranks the Captain.

445
00:24:38,727 --> 00:24:39,811
Will...

446
00:24:41,521 --> 00:24:45,650
You didn't get this far in your
career making easy decisions.

447
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:49,196
I'm confident you'll
make the right one now.

448
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:51,865
I wish I was.

449
00:24:53,325 --> 00:24:55,785
[Reed] He was anything but tactful.

450
00:24:56,119 --> 00:24:58,413
What his countrymen
might refer to as a hick.

451
00:24:58,830 --> 00:24:59,664
For the life of me,

452
00:24:59,748 --> 00:25:01,458
I couldn't understand
what captain archer saw in him.

453
00:25:01,541 --> 00:25:03,543
Thinner. Roll it a little bit thinner,
like this.

454
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:05,420
Oh, yeah, right.

455
00:25:05,629 --> 00:25:06,463
[Riker] Go on.

456
00:25:06,755 --> 00:25:08,465
[Reed sighs] That's about it, really.

457
00:25:08,882 --> 00:25:11,218
I used to think that first
impressions meant something.

458
00:25:11,885 --> 00:25:15,222
I guess it's not always true.
You know, to be honest,

459
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,390
I didn't think he was
gonna last a month.

460
00:25:17,724 --> 00:25:19,267
Old friend of the captain's or not.

461
00:25:20,769 --> 00:25:23,772
And now, I can't imagine
what these last 10 years

462
00:25:23,855 --> 00:25:24,814
would have been like without him.

463
00:25:25,148 --> 00:25:26,942
Did you ever find yourself
attracted to him?

464
00:25:28,318 --> 00:25:30,028
-Maybe a little.
-Hmm.

465
00:25:30,195 --> 00:25:32,030
-I never really thought he was my type.
-Hmm.

466
00:25:32,113 --> 00:25:33,490
Didn't even graduate college,

467
00:25:33,573 --> 00:25:37,244
he learned about engineering
working on boat engines, I think.

468
00:25:38,828 --> 00:25:40,747
Never cared much about languages.

469
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:43,416
[snickers] Could barely speak English.

470
00:25:45,293 --> 00:25:46,836
But he did have his moments.

471
00:25:49,005 --> 00:25:50,966
I still find him kind of cute.

472
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:54,761
-Keep that to yourself.
-Always do.

473
00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:57,180
Captain said they've known
each other a long time.

474
00:25:57,389 --> 00:25:58,848
Close to 20 years.

475
00:25:59,015 --> 00:26:02,269
He taught the captain how to scuba dive
somewhere off the coast of Florida.

476
00:26:02,352 --> 00:26:04,688
You're pressing too hard.
Just slow, steady movement.

477
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:06,648
-Oh, sorry.
-No need to apologize.

478
00:26:06,898 --> 00:26:08,817
They've got a shorthand
they use sometimes.

479
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:10,902
Comes from spending so much time together.

480
00:26:11,069 --> 00:26:12,696
Did Trip ever take a swing at Picard?

481
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:17,200
-At who?
-Archer, Captain Archer?

482
00:26:17,284 --> 00:26:20,495
Not that I know of.
When push comes to shove,

483
00:26:20,578 --> 00:26:22,706
Commander Tucker usually ends up
doing the right thing.

484
00:26:23,498 --> 00:26:24,332
[Travis] How am I doing?

485
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:26,209
Well, don't let it get too big.
Now fold it over.

486
00:26:26,793 --> 00:26:27,752
There you go.

487
00:26:27,836 --> 00:26:29,879
[laughing]

488
00:26:30,005 --> 00:26:33,174
And he's always pushing himself,
Often to the point of exhaustion.

489
00:26:33,258 --> 00:26:35,885
He's forced me to order him to
relax on more than one occasion.

490
00:26:36,261 --> 00:26:37,095
To relax?

491
00:26:37,178 --> 00:26:41,057
Yeah. Wasn't very keen on getting
neuropressure treatments from T'pol.

492
00:26:41,641 --> 00:26:44,311
But it was that or become
addicted to sedatives.

493
00:26:44,436 --> 00:26:46,521
If I remember correctly, that's when...

494
00:26:46,896 --> 00:26:49,274
Their romance began? Mm. Precisely.

495
00:26:49,649 --> 00:26:53,528
One time, he became so exhausted,
I had to demand he get six hours sleep.

496
00:26:53,611 --> 00:26:57,991
He negotiated it down to four.
A very stubborn young man.

497
00:26:58,199 --> 00:27:01,619
Ah! [chuckles] I quite enjoy this.

498
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:03,371
So did he follow your orders?

499
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:04,706
Didn't have a choice.

500
00:27:06,916 --> 00:27:08,209
You've always got a choice.

501
00:27:10,337 --> 00:27:12,005
So, you think this alliance is gonna hold?

502
00:27:12,213 --> 00:27:13,048
We better hope so.

503
00:27:13,131 --> 00:27:14,591
There are thousands
of planets within reach.

504
00:27:15,508 --> 00:27:16,676
Got to start somewhere.

505
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:18,261
Who would have guessed?

506
00:27:18,803 --> 00:27:20,847
Vulcans and Andorians in the same bed.

507
00:27:22,432 --> 00:27:24,976
The Tellarites were never big
fans of the Andorians, either.

508
00:27:26,728 --> 00:27:28,396
This is a special bottle of whiskey.

509
00:27:29,105 --> 00:27:31,066
Zefram Cochrane gave it to my father

510
00:27:31,149 --> 00:27:33,360
the day they broke ground
at the warp 5 complex.

511
00:27:33,818 --> 00:27:37,155
And here we are... toasting to warp 7.

512
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:40,408
Here's to the next generation.

513
00:27:46,081 --> 00:27:47,290
Written your speech yet?

514
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:50,377
I always cram before exams.
I've got three days left.

515
00:27:51,002 --> 00:27:52,003
The biggest day of your life,

516
00:27:52,087 --> 00:27:53,630
and you're gonna wait
until the night before.

517
00:27:53,963 --> 00:27:55,215
It's the biggest day of our lives.

518
00:27:55,382 --> 00:27:57,467
Oh, I hate to contradict you, Captain.

519
00:27:57,842 --> 00:27:59,677
You're the man they're waiting to see.

520
00:27:59,928 --> 00:28:01,888
[rumbling]

521
00:28:04,808 --> 00:28:07,185
-[beeps]
-Archer to the Bridge. What's going on?

522
00:28:07,268 --> 00:28:09,687
[T'pol] <i>We're under attack, sir.</i>
<i>A small vessel.</i>

523
00:28:09,771 --> 00:28:10,605
[Archer] Who are they?

524
00:28:10,688 --> 00:28:12,023
[T'pol] <i>We don't know yet.</i>

525
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:14,109
-[rumbling]
-[alarm ringing]

526
00:28:14,192 --> 00:28:15,443
[T'pol] <i>Intruder alert.</i>

527
00:28:19,364 --> 00:28:21,366
We've come for Shran and the child.

528
00:28:21,616 --> 00:28:23,159
I thought you said their ship
couldn't catch up to us.

529
00:28:23,243 --> 00:28:24,661
Remind me to mention that to Shran.

530
00:28:26,704 --> 00:28:28,540
You're leaving me very little choice.

531
00:28:28,706 --> 00:28:31,292
Shran left six hours ago. You're too late.

532
00:28:31,459 --> 00:28:33,920
You're lying.
His shuttle is still in your launch bay.

533
00:28:34,921 --> 00:28:36,756
-Kill him.
-[Tucker] Hold on! W-wait a minute!

534
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:38,341
-Trip, I'll take care of this.
-The hell you will.

535
00:28:38,425 --> 00:28:39,801
I'll bring you to Shran.
I know where he is.

536
00:28:39,884 --> 00:28:41,177
-I gave you an order, Commander.
-You heard me.

537
00:28:41,261 --> 00:28:42,512
-I said I'd bring you to Shran.
-Trip!

538
00:28:42,595 --> 00:28:44,139
Very well. Turn around, both of you!

539
00:28:44,222 --> 00:28:45,807
-[Tucker] Hey, this guy's the Captain.
-That's enough.

540
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:46,850
[Tucker] He's my boss.

541
00:28:46,933 --> 00:28:48,643
If I'm gonna disobey his order,
I don't want him coming along.

542
00:28:48,727 --> 00:28:49,561
Trip, that's enough!

543
00:28:49,644 --> 00:28:52,355
Listen, I won't do this if you kill him,
but could you please shut him up!

544
00:28:57,068 --> 00:28:58,069
Stop.

545
00:28:58,611 --> 00:29:00,613
You can't expect me
to just leave him here alive.

546
00:29:00,739 --> 00:29:03,283
He's out cold. He's not
gonna cause any trouble.

547
00:29:03,742 --> 00:29:04,576
Stay here.

548
00:29:04,659 --> 00:29:06,661
If we're not back in 10 minutes, kill him.

549
00:29:06,828 --> 00:29:07,954
Didn't you hear what I just said?

550
00:29:08,413 --> 00:29:11,499
I won't help you if you kill him.
This might take longer than 10 minutes!

551
00:29:11,666 --> 00:29:14,127
Take me to Shran,
or I'll kill him right now!

552
00:29:14,210 --> 00:29:15,253
OK, OK!

553
00:29:16,379 --> 00:29:17,714
I've got a better idea.

554
00:29:18,757 --> 00:29:21,593
I'll bring Shran to us.
We don't have to go anywhere.

555
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,219
[grunts]

556
00:29:24,095 --> 00:29:25,430
Be very careful.

557
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:29,350
You can all come see for yourselves.

558
00:29:30,185 --> 00:29:32,103
This is just a comm station.

559
00:29:36,524 --> 00:29:39,778
I'm gonna need to open this
so I can bypass the security protocols.

560
00:29:39,944 --> 00:29:40,904
Is that OK?

561
00:29:40,987 --> 00:29:42,906
As long as you keep your hands
where we can see them.

562
00:29:42,989 --> 00:29:43,907
No problem.

563
00:29:44,866 --> 00:29:46,534
[beeps]

564
00:29:57,253 --> 00:30:01,257
All I need to do is connect this
to the relay inside that panel.

565
00:30:01,341 --> 00:30:03,718
Stop. Open it for him.

566
00:30:05,178 --> 00:30:08,515
If there's a weapon in there,
you're going to die before your Captain.

567
00:30:13,186 --> 00:30:14,229
Satisfied?

568
00:30:16,397 --> 00:30:17,440
Proceed.

569
00:30:23,571 --> 00:30:25,698
Hurry up. You're running out of time.

570
00:30:26,449 --> 00:30:28,409
There's just one other thing
I need to tell you.

571
00:30:30,036 --> 00:30:31,371
You can all go straight to hell.

572
00:30:32,038 --> 00:30:34,457
[screaming]

573
00:30:37,001 --> 00:30:39,462
[groaning]

574
00:30:57,146 --> 00:30:58,064
Trip?

575
00:31:15,331 --> 00:31:16,416
[medic] He's not responding.

576
00:31:16,499 --> 00:31:17,375
[Phlox] Add two percent syntho-surfactant!

577
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:18,501
[Archer] Doctor.

578
00:31:18,585 --> 00:31:20,587
[Phlox] The plasma was super-heated.
It thermalized his lungs.

579
00:31:20,670 --> 00:31:22,297
Initialize a hyperbaric chamber.

580
00:31:24,591 --> 00:31:29,512
S-sorry about the r-rifle butt.

581
00:31:29,637 --> 00:31:31,014
[breathing heavily]

582
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:33,933
-I was just trying to...
-I know, Trip.

583
00:31:34,517 --> 00:31:36,227
Just take it easy. Everything's all right.

584
00:31:36,436 --> 00:31:37,896
We gonna be late?

585
00:31:37,979 --> 00:31:40,773
[Archer] No.
We're gonna be right on schedule.

586
00:31:40,857 --> 00:31:42,692
I'll even have time to write my speech.

587
00:31:43,735 --> 00:31:44,903
Great news.

588
00:31:46,029 --> 00:31:47,322
Wait till they...

589
00:31:47,822 --> 00:31:48,865
[gasps]

590
00:31:49,032 --> 00:31:49,908
[beeping]

591
00:31:50,158 --> 00:31:51,367
We need to get him into the chamber now!

592
00:31:59,709 --> 00:32:00,627
Clear!

593
00:32:50,426 --> 00:32:51,386
Need any help?

594
00:32:53,763 --> 00:32:55,014
No, thank you.

595
00:32:56,349 --> 00:32:57,183
For his parents?

596
00:33:00,061 --> 00:33:01,896
Will they still be coming to the ceremony?

597
00:33:02,021 --> 00:33:04,899
I told them I thought Trip
wouldn't want it any other way.

598
00:33:14,242 --> 00:33:15,410
Don't forget this.

599
00:33:19,455 --> 00:33:22,333
-I'd like to meet them.
-His parents?

600
00:33:23,251 --> 00:33:24,752
Yes, I'd like to meet them.

601
00:33:25,753 --> 00:33:26,879
They're a little eccentric.

602
00:33:29,007 --> 00:33:32,051
I think you'll see where Trip
got his sense of humor.

603
00:33:33,761 --> 00:33:36,514
My mother was somewhat eccentric, as well.

604
00:33:36,597 --> 00:33:37,557
[Archer] I remember.

605
00:33:42,437 --> 00:33:46,357
Trip told me, as the years went by,
that I would miss her less.

606
00:33:46,941 --> 00:33:51,863
But he was wrong,
because I find myself missing her more.

607
00:33:54,532 --> 00:33:56,409
[sighs] Why would he tell me that?

608
00:33:57,660 --> 00:33:59,078
[sighs]

609
00:33:59,162 --> 00:34:01,914
Time heals all wounds.

610
00:34:01,998 --> 00:34:05,251
But absence makes the heart grow fonder.

611
00:34:05,543 --> 00:34:07,462
I guess it's a little tricky.

612
00:34:10,715 --> 00:34:14,552
Emotions have a way
of contradicting themselves.

613
00:34:15,970 --> 00:34:18,056
And you wonder why we suppress them?

614
00:34:21,893 --> 00:34:24,228
When I took command 10 years ago,

615
00:34:24,771 --> 00:34:26,856
I saw myself as an explorer.

616
00:34:27,732 --> 00:34:30,943
I thought all the risks would be worth it.

617
00:34:31,486 --> 00:34:34,697
Because just beyond the next planet,
just beyond the next star,

618
00:34:34,781 --> 00:34:38,326
there would be something magnificent,

619
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:39,702
something noble.

620
00:34:45,416 --> 00:34:49,462
And now Trip is dead,
and I have to give a speech

621
00:34:49,545 --> 00:34:53,508
about how worthwhile it's all been.

622
00:34:55,093 --> 00:34:58,679
Trip would be the first to say
it was worthwhile.

623
00:35:12,485 --> 00:35:14,654
Fried catfish with hush puppies.

624
00:35:15,154 --> 00:35:17,156
Obviously, the captain mentioned
why I wanted to see you.

625
00:35:17,365 --> 00:35:18,658
[chuckles]

626
00:35:18,741 --> 00:35:21,119
Keep in mind, within a week,
I'll be eating the real thing.

627
00:35:21,202 --> 00:35:22,662
Taking my folks down to mobile.

628
00:35:22,745 --> 00:35:24,163
Nothing like a challenge.

629
00:35:24,247 --> 00:35:25,832
Captain asked for meatloaf, didn't he?

630
00:35:25,915 --> 00:35:26,916
I haven't spoken to him yet.

631
00:35:27,166 --> 00:35:30,253
How about T'pol?
She won't be very cooperative.

632
00:35:30,336 --> 00:35:31,170
You wait and see.

633
00:35:32,171 --> 00:35:34,090
I've already started her plomeek broth.

634
00:35:34,173 --> 00:35:36,968
All she has to do is choose
a few final ingredients.

635
00:35:37,051 --> 00:35:38,594
She'll be down here in about an hour.

636
00:35:39,762 --> 00:35:41,764
I hear we're on our way to pick up Shran.

637
00:35:41,889 --> 00:35:43,141
Can you believe it?

638
00:35:43,850 --> 00:35:45,226
We all thought he was dead and gone.

639
00:35:45,309 --> 00:35:47,436
Well, don't you think the Captain's
cutting it a little close?

640
00:35:47,687 --> 00:35:50,314
You mean, getting back to San Francisco?

641
00:35:51,023 --> 00:35:53,276
Nah, he won't let anything
get in the way of that.

642
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:54,235
Trust me.

643
00:35:56,112 --> 00:35:57,822
Can you spare one of those carrots?

644
00:35:57,905 --> 00:35:59,866
-They're not peeled yet.
-That's OK.

645
00:36:03,578 --> 00:36:06,330
You know, he'd never admit it,

646
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:09,250
but this thing means
a hell of a lot to him.

647
00:36:10,334 --> 00:36:13,045
He's real proud to be one of
the people signing this charter.

648
00:36:13,296 --> 00:36:15,214
And he ought to be.

649
00:36:15,506 --> 00:36:18,050
You sound like a lifetime member
of the Jonathan Archer fan club.

650
00:36:21,012 --> 00:36:24,140
I can count on one hand
the number of people I trust.

651
00:36:25,683 --> 00:36:27,351
I don't mean trust like,

652
00:36:28,477 --> 00:36:32,273
"I trust you aren't lying to me,"
or "i trust you won't steal my money."

653
00:36:32,899 --> 00:36:34,901
I'm talking about
the kind of trust where...

654
00:36:36,068 --> 00:36:39,363
You know someone's not gonna
hurt you, no matter what,

655
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:42,450
where you know they'll always
be there for you,

656
00:36:42,533 --> 00:36:44,035
no matter how bad things get.

657
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:47,121
You ever know anybody like that?

658
00:36:48,497 --> 00:36:49,498
Yeah.

659
00:36:50,583 --> 00:36:51,584
One or two.

660
00:36:54,754 --> 00:36:58,090
Well, I've got some packing
to do before I go back on duty.

661
00:37:00,176 --> 00:37:01,594
You figured out what you're gonna do?

662
00:37:03,137 --> 00:37:03,971
Do?

663
00:37:04,096 --> 00:37:05,097
You gonna sign onto another ship,

664
00:37:05,264 --> 00:37:07,016
or are you gonna open up
that little restaurant

665
00:37:07,099 --> 00:37:08,476
in the Berkshires you told me about?

666
00:37:08,684 --> 00:37:11,270
You know, I haven't decided yet.
You got any advice?

667
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:13,147
[chuckles] Nope.

668
00:37:13,231 --> 00:37:14,315
[laughs]

669
00:37:17,485 --> 00:37:19,695
But I'm sure you'll make the right choice.

670
00:37:30,331 --> 00:37:32,583
Are you certain these are the right seats?

671
00:37:32,667 --> 00:37:33,501
[Travis] Yep.

672
00:37:34,585 --> 00:37:36,837
They don't seem very V.I.P. to me.

673
00:37:37,004 --> 00:37:39,090
I'm sure the admiral
wanted us to have a view

674
00:37:39,215 --> 00:37:41,050
that took in the scope of the occasion.

675
00:37:41,884 --> 00:37:43,678
From this distance,
you can't tell an Andorian

676
00:37:43,761 --> 00:37:45,054
from a Tellarite.

677
00:37:46,097 --> 00:37:48,557
Oh, have you given an answer
to Captain still well yet?

678
00:37:48,641 --> 00:37:50,393
I've asked him for a little more time,

679
00:37:50,476 --> 00:37:52,687
until captain archer decides
what he's going to be doing.

680
00:37:53,062 --> 00:37:56,065
I'll bet you a month's pay
he'll be on the bridge of a new ship.

681
00:37:56,148 --> 00:37:58,901
He won't be able to resist one
of those warp 7 beauties.

682
00:37:59,527 --> 00:38:01,570
I've heard he's already
been tapped for Admiral.

683
00:38:02,071 --> 00:38:05,074
Malcolm's right.
They'll never keep him behind a desk.

684
00:38:05,616 --> 00:38:08,119
It's very wise of you to stick with him.

685
00:38:08,286 --> 00:38:10,121
That's exactly what I plan to do.

686
00:38:12,456 --> 00:38:13,624
[beeping]

687
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:20,965
Please, stand still.

688
00:38:21,924 --> 00:38:23,718
If you hadn't waited
until the last minute,

689
00:38:23,884 --> 00:38:26,262
you would have had time
to memorize your speech.

690
00:38:26,887 --> 00:38:28,514
You sound like my 9th-grade teacher.

691
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:32,393
There are dignitaries here
from 18 different worlds.

692
00:38:32,476 --> 00:38:34,729
[chuckles] It's a good sign.

693
00:38:34,937 --> 00:38:39,191
I wouldn't be surprised if this alliance
begins to expand before we know it.

694
00:38:39,984 --> 00:38:41,736
You should be very proud
of yourself, Captain.

695
00:38:41,861 --> 00:38:44,613
I'll be proud of myself
if I get this speech out in one piece.

696
00:38:45,823 --> 00:38:47,199
That's not what I meant.

697
00:38:48,909 --> 00:38:51,787
I know what you meant, Phlox,
and I appreciate it.

698
00:38:52,955 --> 00:38:54,332
But this is not about me.

699
00:38:54,832 --> 00:38:57,126
Why do so many humans
refuse to take credit

700
00:38:57,251 --> 00:38:58,502
where credit is due?

701
00:38:58,794 --> 00:39:02,423
There are times when modesty
and humility are quite illogical.

702
00:39:03,591 --> 00:39:04,884
Whenever you're ready, sir.

703
00:39:06,177 --> 00:39:09,221
Well, I've got three wives waiting.
I'd better go and join them.

704
00:39:11,474 --> 00:39:13,684
I'd wish you good luck, Captain,

705
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:18,356
but you've always had an ample supply.

706
00:39:18,439 --> 00:39:19,565
Thank you, doctor.

707
00:39:26,322 --> 00:39:27,615
[Archer] You'd better get out there.

708
00:39:29,325 --> 00:39:31,535
You don't want to miss me
screwing this thing up.

709
00:39:31,744 --> 00:39:34,497
I'm going to remain down here,
if you don't mind.

710
00:39:35,331 --> 00:39:36,624
You never did like crowds, did you?

711
00:39:42,671 --> 00:39:43,631
You look...

712
00:39:45,299 --> 00:39:46,425
very heroic.

713
00:40:14,745 --> 00:40:16,330
[applause]

714
00:40:31,095 --> 00:40:32,596
Is he nervous?

715
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:33,931
Wouldn't you be?

716
00:40:34,056 --> 00:40:35,558
Oh, he'll be fine.

717
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:38,602
I had to memorize this speech
in grammar school.

718
00:40:40,187 --> 00:40:41,647
You wish you could tell them all

719
00:40:41,730 --> 00:40:44,400
that this alliance will
give birth to the Federation.

720
00:40:46,485 --> 00:40:48,404
I think I'm ready to talk
to Captain Picard.

721
00:40:48,487 --> 00:40:50,406
I should have done it a long time ago.

722
00:40:51,282 --> 00:40:52,908
So, I guess we're through here.

723
00:40:53,576 --> 00:40:54,869
-[applause]
-I guess we are.

724
00:40:55,578 --> 00:40:56,412
Computer...

725
00:40:56,495 --> 00:40:57,329
[beeps]

726
00:40:59,206 --> 00:41:00,541
...End program.

727
00:41:00,624 --> 00:41:01,667
[beeps]

728
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:17,600
[Picard] <i>Space, the final frontier.</i>

729
00:41:18,058 --> 00:41:21,562
<i>These are the voyages</i>
<i>of the Starship </i>Enterprise.

730
00:41:21,645 --> 00:41:23,564
<i>Its continuing mission...</i>

731
00:41:24,523 --> 00:41:26,984
[Kirk] <i>To explore strange new worlds,</i>

732
00:41:27,485 --> 00:41:30,696
<i>to seek out new life</i>
<i>and new civilizations...</i>

733
00:41:32,156 --> 00:41:35,826
[Archer] <i>To boldly go</i>
<i>where no man has gone before.</i>
