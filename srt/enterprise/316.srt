1
00:00:37,579 --> 00:00:40,081
Porthos! No, come back here!

2
00:00:41,207 --> 00:00:44,127
Porthos! Stop! Return!

3
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:47,505
Well, uh, heel! That's it. Heel!

4
00:00:47,589 --> 00:00:48,715
Oh, Porthos.

5
00:00:48,798 --> 00:00:50,341
( sighs )

6
00:00:51,009 --> 00:00:52,177
( whimpering )

7
00:00:53,344 --> 00:00:54,554
( sighs )

8
00:00:56,347 --> 00:00:58,141
( barking )

9
00:00:58,224 --> 00:01:00,977
All right, but just for a moment.

10
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:07,650
( whimpering )

11
00:01:13,782 --> 00:01:15,283
That's enough.

12
00:01:15,366 --> 00:01:17,619
You can come and see him again tomorrow.

13
00:01:17,702 --> 00:01:19,954

00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:57,969
Is that why you keep returning
to the Captain's quarters?

36
00:02:58,052 --> 00:03:00,805
{\an8}( chuckles )

37
00:03:00,889 --> 00:03:02,140
{\an8}Hmm...

38
00:03:02,223 --> 00:03:07,645
{\an8}On Earth, a dog called Scruffers
traveled 3,000 kilometers

39
00:03:07,729 --> 00:03:11,399
{\an8}attempting to reunite
with its human keeper.

40
00:03:11,482 --> 00:03:14,611
{\an8}( exclaims ) I heard of a Pycan space moth

41
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:19,240
{\an8}that drifted half a light-year
trying to return to its homeworld.

42
00:03:19,324 --> 00:03:22,493
{\an8}But I don't believe it had a name.

43
00:03:22,577 --> 00:03:24,120
{\an8}( sighs )

44
00:03:24,203 --> 00:03:27,123
{\an8}I could use a walk. How about you?

45
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:34,923
{\an8}( computer beeps )

46
00:03:35,006 --> 00:03:39,510
{\an8}Dear Dr. Lucas, I apologize for the delay
in responding to your last letter.

47
00:03:39,594 --> 00:03:42,138
{\an8}As you can imagine,
the crew and I have been quite busy.

48
00:03:43,765 --> 00:03:45,308
{\an8}In we go.

49
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:50,521
{\an8}I was deeply saddened to hear

50
00:03:50,605 --> 00:03:54,067
{\an8}about your colleagues
lost in the Xindi attack.

51
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:56,569
{\an8}You have my condolences.

52
00:03:56,653 --> 00:03:59,697
{\an8}It's unfortunate you were forced
to cut your time on Denobula short,

53
00:03:59,781 --> 00:04:02,617
{\an8}but, uh, obviously you're needed on Earth.

54
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:04,869
Perhaps when our mission
is successfully completed,

55
00:04:04,953 --> 00:04:08,831
I'll see you back in San Francisco.

56
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:12,710
The Expanse... an extremely curious place.

57
00:04:14,295 --> 00:04:18,549
For example, we've recently encountered
a phenomenon that--

58
00:04:18,633 --> 00:04:19,968
( barking )

59
00:04:20,051 --> 00:04:20,969
Do you want one of these?

60
00:04:21,052 --> 00:04:22,345
( barking )

61
00:04:22,428 --> 00:04:24,347
( chuckles ) I doubt you'd like it.

62
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:26,057
It's a leech, you know.

63
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:28,226
It will clean out your intestinal tract.

64
00:04:28,309 --> 00:04:30,061
Don't tell the Captain.

65
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:34,565
( chuckles )

66
00:04:34,649 --> 00:04:36,985
I currently find myself

67
00:04:37,068 --> 00:04:41,114
in somewhat unsettling circumstances,
Dr. Lucas,

68
00:04:41,197 --> 00:04:47,245
although they have allowed me the luxury
of catching up on my correspondence.

69
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:52,959
<i>We first encountered the phenomenon</i>

70
00:04:53,042 --> 00:04:56,212
<i>responsible for this situation </i>
<i>two days ago.</i>

71
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:58,673
T'POL: It's directly on our route
to Azati Prime.

72
00:04:58,756 --> 00:05:01,092
Why didn't sensors pick it up before now?

73
00:05:01,175 --> 00:05:03,678
Because it wasn't there before now.

74
00:05:03,761 --> 00:05:07,807
It's similar to the phenomenon
we encountered several weeks ago.

75
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:10,310
A trans-dimensional disturbance?

76
00:05:10,393 --> 00:05:13,771
This region is being rapidly
reconfigured as we speak.

77
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:15,481
How long would it take to go around it?

78
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:17,859
Two weeks.

79
00:05:17,942 --> 00:05:20,236
-Another detour.
-T'POL: Perhaps not.

80
00:05:20,903 --> 00:05:23,364
Since this region was formed
only recently,

81
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:26,200
it hasn't been completely reconfigured.

82
00:05:26,284 --> 00:05:28,786
We should still be able
to cross it safely.

83
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:32,165
You said nothing from our universe
could survive inside these things.

84
00:05:32,957 --> 00:05:34,792
-Doctor.
-PHLOX: That's true,

85
00:05:34,876 --> 00:05:37,545
unless we take
the appropriate precautions.

86
00:05:37,628 --> 00:05:40,590
The reconfigured space
disrupts the human neocortex.

87
00:05:40,673 --> 00:05:42,800
But I can counteract the effects

88
00:05:42,884 --> 00:05:45,094
by dampening the crew's
neurological activity.

89
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:48,139
It would be like, uh, oh,
shutting down the main computer

90
00:05:48,222 --> 00:05:50,266
to protect it from an ion storm.

91
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:55,063
How do you plan to shut down
our neocortexes?

92
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:58,066
Quite simply, I can place each of you
in a comatose state

93
00:05:58,149 --> 00:06:00,651
until we've passed through
the affected region.

94
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:04,238
How quickly can we get across it?

95
00:06:04,322 --> 00:06:06,532
Less than an hour at warp 4.

96
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:08,951
I don't want to risk
going to warp in there.

97
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:10,870
Who knows what kind of effect
this disturbance will have

98
00:06:10,953 --> 00:06:12,413
on our warp field?

99
00:06:12,497 --> 00:06:14,749
We'll be safer sticking to impulse.

100
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:18,753
You'll have to keep us in comas for...

101
00:06:18,836 --> 00:06:21,297
( sighs ) At least four days.

102
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:24,926
That's still less time than
it would take to go around it.

103
00:06:25,009 --> 00:06:27,178
Can you keep us under that long?

104
00:06:27,261 --> 00:06:28,721
Shouldn't cause any problems.

105
00:06:30,723 --> 00:06:33,142
PHLOX: <i>Commander Tucker </i>
<i>was not too keen on my plan.</i>

106
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:36,354
<i>However, I was able</i>
<i>to convince Captain Archer.</i>

107
00:06:36,437 --> 00:06:37,522
( grunts )

108
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:44,612
<i>Since my Denobulan physiology is immune</i>
<i>to the effects of the disturbance,</i>

109
00:06:44,695 --> 00:06:48,783
<i>I volunteered to watch over the crew.</i>

110
00:06:48,866 --> 00:06:52,703
<i>So far... Ah...</i>

111
00:06:52,787 --> 00:06:55,623
<i>They've been no trouble at all.</i>

112
00:06:55,706 --> 00:06:58,626
<i>While the computer is controlling</i>
<i>most of the ship's systems,</i>

113
00:06:58,709 --> 00:07:01,671
<i>I was given a quick tutorial, </i>
<i>just in case.</i>

114
00:07:01,754 --> 00:07:03,589
<i>Despite the dire circumstances,</i>

115
00:07:03,673 --> 00:07:06,592
<i>I must say I relished the challenge...</i>

116
00:07:06,676 --> 00:07:10,555
<i>And soon developed a newfound respect </i>
<i>for Ensign Mayweather.</i>

117
00:07:10,638 --> 00:07:12,265
( inaudible )

118
00:07:15,726 --> 00:07:18,604
TUCKER: You need to check this
every two hours, minimum.

119
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:19,981
Every two hours.

120
00:07:20,064 --> 00:07:23,025
If the impulse manifolds get clogged,
the engines will overload.

121
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:25,153
That would be very bad.

122
00:07:25,236 --> 00:07:26,571
I imagine it would.

123
00:07:26,654 --> 00:07:27,738
No offense, Doc,

124
00:07:27,822 --> 00:07:30,116
but under normal circumstances,

125
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:32,076
I wouldn't even let you in here
without four years

126
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,370
of Starfleet training under your belt.

127
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:36,581
These are hardly normal circumstances.

128
00:07:37,373 --> 00:07:39,250
Listen.

129
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:42,920
If something happens,
something you can't handle,

130
00:07:43,004 --> 00:07:45,465
-I want you to wake me up.
-I can't do that.

131
00:07:45,548 --> 00:07:48,384
Even a few minutes of exposure
would cause permanent damage.

132
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:50,720
If it comes down to saving me or the ship?

133
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:56,017
Look. I'm making it easy for you, OK?

134
00:08:07,778 --> 00:08:09,322
ARCHER: How's the rest of the crew doing?

135
00:08:09,405 --> 00:08:12,158
Sleeping peacefully, except for you.

136
00:08:12,241 --> 00:08:13,910
Now, lie back.

137
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:15,119
-Doctor--
-Ah!

138
00:08:15,203 --> 00:08:18,623
Please, Captain, I've told you
the procedure is completely safe.

139
00:08:18,706 --> 00:08:20,124
I'm sure it is, but I--

140
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:22,627
Captain,
I have already had this discussion

141
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:24,086
with Commander Tucker, Lieutenant Reed,

142
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:26,547
and virtually
every other officer on the ship.

143
00:08:26,631 --> 00:08:28,591
"I'm not comfortable being incapacitated."

144
00:08:28,674 --> 00:08:29,759
"I really should be at my post."

145
00:08:29,842 --> 00:08:31,677
"I'm willing to risk staying awake."

146
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:33,304
Well, you can't, nor do you need to.

147
00:08:33,387 --> 00:08:36,140
I assure you,
I have everything well in hand.

148
00:08:36,224 --> 00:08:39,018
I know, Doctor. As captain of this ship,

149
00:08:39,101 --> 00:08:42,480
I'm the one who's responsible
for everyone aboard.

150
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:44,607
There's aren't many people

151
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:47,485
I'd willingly turn
that responsibility over to.

152
00:08:48,986 --> 00:08:50,196
You're one of them.

153
00:08:52,573 --> 00:08:54,659
Ah. ( chuckles )

154
00:08:54,742 --> 00:08:57,328
Well, uh, thank you, Captain.

155
00:08:57,411 --> 00:09:01,499
I just wanted to say that
before you put me under.

156
00:09:19,016 --> 00:09:20,643
PHLOX: <i>I must say, Dr. Lucas,</i>

157
00:09:20,726 --> 00:09:23,104
<i>that I appreciated the Captain's</i>
<i>vote of confidence.</i>

158
00:09:23,187 --> 00:09:26,148
<i>I had, in fact, </i>
<i>been feeling some trepidation</i>

159
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:27,942
<i>over the responsibility I'd been handed.</i>

160
00:09:28,025 --> 00:09:33,573
<i>But after two days at the helm,</i>
<i>the ship is running perfectly.</i>

161
00:09:33,656 --> 00:09:34,657
( clatter )

162
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:38,911
Hello?

163
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:46,294
Hello?

164
00:09:53,301 --> 00:09:56,429
<i>Nonetheless, I'm not ashamed to admit</i>

165
00:09:56,512 --> 00:10:01,559
<i>I'll be relieved when</i>
<i>I can wake up the crew in, uh...</i>

166
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:09,525
<i>Two days, 16 hours, and 43 minutes.</i>

167
00:10:11,902 --> 00:10:14,572
( singing in Denobulan )

168
00:10:22,413 --> 00:10:24,332
( animals chattering )

169
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:28,628
I know, I know. I'm sorry I'm late.

170
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:45,853
<i>I don't want the vessel with a pestle.</i>
<i>I want the chalice from the what?</i>

171
00:10:45,936 --> 00:10:47,104
<i>-The chalice from the palace.</i>
<i>-Hmm?</i>

172
00:10:47,188 --> 00:10:49,148
<i>It's a little crystal chalice</i>
<i>with a figure of a palace.</i>

173
00:10:49,231 --> 00:10:51,150
<i>Does the chalice from the palace</i>
<i>have the pellet with the poison?</i>

174
00:10:51,233 --> 00:10:53,152
<i>No, the pellet with the poison</i>
<i>is in the vessel with a pestle.</i>

175
00:10:53,235 --> 00:10:55,154
-MAN: <i>Oh, the pestle with the vessel.</i>
-WOMAN: <i>The vessel with a pestle.</i>

176
00:10:55,237 --> 00:10:56,405
MAN: <i>What about the palace </i>
<i>from the chalice?</i>

177
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:58,866
WOMAN 2: <i>Not the palace from the chalice.</i>
<i>The chalice from the palace.</i>

178
00:10:58,949 --> 00:11:01,160
-MAN: <i>Where's the pellet with the poison?</i>
-WOMAN 2: <i>In the vessel with a pestle.</i>

179
00:11:01,243 --> 00:11:02,244
-WOMAN: <i>Don't you see?</i>
-( Porthos whimpers )

180
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:03,829
<i>The pellet with the poison's</i>
<i>in the vessel with a pestle.</i>

181
00:11:03,913 --> 00:11:05,831
<i>The chalice from the palace</i>
<i>has the brew that is true.</i>

182
00:11:05,915 --> 00:11:08,042
<i>-So easy, I can say it.</i>
<i>-Well, then, you find it.</i>

183
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:09,627
<i>Listen carefully.</i>

184
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:10,878
-( clang )
<i>-The pellet with the poison's</i>

185
00:11:10,961 --> 00:11:11,837
<i>in the vessel with a pestle.</i>

186
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:14,298
<i>The chalice from the palace</i>
<i>has the brew that is true.</i>

187
00:11:14,382 --> 00:11:16,300
MAN: <i>Where the pellet with the poison's</i>
<i>in the vessel with a pestle...</i>

188
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:18,386
Did you hear that?

189
00:11:18,469 --> 00:11:19,929
-WOMAN: <i>Good man!</i>
-WOMAN 2: <i>Just remember that.</i>

190
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:22,515
MAN: <i>Sir Giacomo</i>
<i>Sir Giacomo, into your armor.</i>

191
00:11:22,598 --> 00:11:24,433
<i>And you to your place in the pavilion.</i>

192
00:11:27,603 --> 00:11:30,356
-( clang )
<i>-The pellet with the poison...</i>

193
00:11:30,439 --> 00:11:32,525
<i>-The pellet with the poison--</i>
-Computer, mute sound.

194
00:11:32,608 --> 00:11:33,984
( inaudible )

195
00:11:37,405 --> 00:11:38,697
( clang )

196
00:11:41,617 --> 00:11:44,286
That doesn't sound normal, does it?

197
00:11:46,789 --> 00:11:49,792
I suppose we should investigate, hmm?

198
00:11:58,592 --> 00:11:59,844
I'm not going alone.

199
00:12:00,928 --> 00:12:03,556
Come, Porthos. Come!

200
00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:05,182
( sighs )

201
00:12:06,434 --> 00:12:10,396
Oh, I'd be better off
talking to my Pyrithian bat.

202
00:12:25,703 --> 00:12:29,457
Perhaps we were letting our imaginations
run away with us, hmm?

203
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:34,378
I should never have let Mr. Tucker talk me
into watching <i>The Exorcist </i>last week.

204
00:12:37,756 --> 00:12:39,675
( clang )

205
00:12:50,978 --> 00:12:52,021
Hello?

206
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:55,566
It's Dr. Phlox.

207
00:12:58,736 --> 00:13:00,488
-( Porthos barking )
-Porthos!

208
00:13:02,698 --> 00:13:04,366
Porthos, come back here!

209
00:13:05,701 --> 00:13:06,702
Porthos!

210
00:13:06,785 --> 00:13:08,662
( gas hissing )

211
00:13:17,338 --> 00:13:18,839
( scoffs )

212
00:13:21,175 --> 00:13:23,802
Well, now don't you feel foolish?

213
00:13:26,013 --> 00:13:27,306
( clatter )

214
00:13:29,391 --> 00:13:30,809
( sighs )

215
00:13:32,353 --> 00:13:35,481
I called out. Didn't you hear me?

216
00:13:35,564 --> 00:13:37,983
I was running a diagnostic.

217
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:39,818
Do you require my assistance?

218
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:42,321
( sighs )

219
00:13:42,821 --> 00:13:45,324
What are you doing here?
I thought it was movie night.

220
00:13:45,407 --> 00:13:47,284
I could hear that all the way
from the mess hall.

221
00:13:47,368 --> 00:13:49,620
I'll make a note of it
in the maintenance log.

222
00:13:50,746 --> 00:13:51,789
Hmm.

223
00:13:51,872 --> 00:13:56,377
Bangs, squeaks, rattling chains.

224
00:13:58,587 --> 00:14:00,548
Is this a starship or a haunted house?

225
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:04,134
Are you all right, Doctor?
You seem somewhat agitated.

226
00:14:04,218 --> 00:14:06,887
Well, considering you nearly
sent me into cardiac shock...

227
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:08,806
I apologize if I startled you.

228
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,183
You're certain that's all?

229
00:14:12,434 --> 00:14:16,272
Oh, I have had a slight headache
since we entered this region.

230
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:18,274
Perhaps Vulcans and Earth canines

231
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:21,527
are better able to adapt to it
than Denobulans.

232
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:25,030
How are you, hmm?
I've barely seen you the last two days.

233
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:27,241
I've had my duties to attend to.

234
00:14:27,324 --> 00:14:31,287
The rest of the time I've spent
in my quarters reading, meditating.

235
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:32,663
Then you're due for a night out.

236
00:14:32,746 --> 00:14:34,665
Why don't you join Porthos and me?

237
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:37,501
I'd like to complete the diagnostic.

238
00:14:38,502 --> 00:14:41,046
The movie's quite amusing.

239
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:42,339
No, thank you.

240
00:14:43,507 --> 00:14:45,092
T'Pol.

241
00:14:45,175 --> 00:14:47,970
I, um, uh...

242
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:51,098
Perhaps you'll share a meal with me later.

243
00:14:52,766 --> 00:14:54,059
If you like.

244
00:14:55,352 --> 00:14:56,645
Ah...

245
00:15:04,528 --> 00:15:07,448
( humming )

246
00:15:09,033 --> 00:15:11,952
( computer beeping )

247
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:15,247
( clattering )

248
00:15:16,457 --> 00:15:17,708
Hello?

249
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:26,091
-( humming )
-( clatter )

250
00:15:27,885 --> 00:15:29,178
T'Pol?

251
00:15:30,721 --> 00:15:32,056
Is that you?

252
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:46,946
( clatter )

253
00:15:47,029 --> 00:15:48,530
Stop!

254
00:15:51,283 --> 00:15:53,619
-Phlox to T'Pol.
<i>-Go ahead.</i>

255
00:15:53,702 --> 00:15:55,204
Would you mind
not creeping around the ship

256
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:57,998
like a Draxxan cloud viper?

257
00:15:58,082 --> 00:15:59,208
T'POL: <i>Doctor?</i>

258
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:03,545
Please. I wouldn't have imagined
that Vulcans engaged in childish games.

259
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:05,339
T'POL: <i>I don't understand.</i>

260
00:16:05,422 --> 00:16:08,509
What were you doing
in engineering just now?

261
00:16:08,592 --> 00:16:11,011
T'POL: <i>Doctor, I'm on the bridge.</i>

262
00:16:23,232 --> 00:16:25,192
Ah!

263
00:16:25,275 --> 00:16:29,405
I hope you don't, uh,
mind eating here in the galley.

264
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:33,701
The mess hall seems a bit, oh, melancholy.

265
00:16:33,784 --> 00:16:35,869
All the empty chairs.

266
00:16:35,953 --> 00:16:37,538
T'POL: This is fine.

267
00:16:37,621 --> 00:16:39,164
Fine.

268
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:43,377
My fifth grandmother made this
for each of my weddings.

269
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:48,298
Chef's tried to prepare it,
but he never gets it quite right.

270
00:16:48,382 --> 00:16:51,552
( exclaiming )

271
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:56,265
Yes, his Plomeek broth
leaves something to be desired as well.

272
00:16:56,348 --> 00:16:59,309
I always thought so,
but, uh, I was afraid to mention it.

273
00:16:59,393 --> 00:17:01,186
( sighs )

274
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:05,607
Mmm. ( chuckles )

275
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:09,987
T'Pol, um, you're sure you
weren't in engineering today?

276
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:11,238
Quite sure.

277
00:17:12,906 --> 00:17:14,408
What were you doing there?

278
00:17:14,491 --> 00:17:17,286
I'm responsible for
monitoring the engines.

279
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:19,872
We're supposed to be assisting each other.

280
00:17:19,955 --> 00:17:23,167
It's a large ship
for two people to maintain.

281
00:17:24,626 --> 00:17:26,211
Do you have anything to report?

282
00:17:29,381 --> 00:17:30,382
Doctor?

283
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:33,677
I could have sworn there was
someone in that room with me.

284
00:17:33,761 --> 00:17:35,971
-A member of the crew?
-No.

285
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:39,308
Everyone except us
is in deep neuro-sedation.

286
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:44,229
Then obviously you were mistaken.

287
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:46,940
Obviously. ( chuckles )

288
00:17:47,024 --> 00:17:49,443
You've never been to Denobula, have you?

289
00:17:49,526 --> 00:17:51,695
No.

290
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:55,908
The cities are quite crowded...
by choice, not by necessity.

291
00:17:55,991 --> 00:17:58,786
The atmosphere is vibrant, communal.

292
00:17:58,869 --> 00:18:00,162
It sounds fascinating.

293
00:18:00,245 --> 00:18:03,665
What I'm saying is that
we're a sociable people.

294
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:08,504
Being alone on <i>Enterprise, </i>
just the two of us,

295
00:18:08,587 --> 00:18:11,465
has proven more stressful than I imagined.

296
00:18:11,548 --> 00:18:14,301
Two people aren't even enough
for a Denobulan marriage--

297
00:18:14,384 --> 00:18:16,845
A proper one, anyway.

298
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:19,640
I'm sorry I haven't been better company.

299
00:18:19,723 --> 00:18:21,225
That isn't what I meant.

300
00:18:21,308 --> 00:18:22,810
I know.

301
00:18:24,436 --> 00:18:28,065
It is ironic, however,
that I should be your sole companion.

302
00:18:29,066 --> 00:18:33,821
Unlike your people, most Vulcans
will go to great lengths to find solitude.

303
00:18:34,488 --> 00:18:39,576
At times, it has been trying for me
to coexist with 80 humans,

304
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:42,913
especially the more irrational ones.

305
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:46,458
Mm, such as, uh, Commander Tucker.

306
00:18:47,501 --> 00:18:50,504
I've found the last two days
to be a welcome respite.

307
00:18:51,755 --> 00:18:54,258
I understand, but I, for one,
will never complain again

308
00:18:54,341 --> 00:18:57,177
when I can't get a good seat
on movie night.

309
00:19:02,057 --> 00:19:05,519
Despite the tragic circumstances
surrounding your homecoming, Dr. Lucas,

310
00:19:05,602 --> 00:19:07,354
you must be happy to return to Earth.

311
00:19:07,437 --> 00:19:08,480
( chuckles )

312
00:19:10,899 --> 00:19:12,151
As I've mentioned before,

313
00:19:12,234 --> 00:19:16,071
I have no regrets
about accepting my position on <i>Enterprise.</i>

314
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:17,531
However, it has struck me recently

315
00:19:17,614 --> 00:19:20,993
how much I miss
the familiar pleasures of my home.

316
00:19:21,076 --> 00:19:22,327
( chuckles )

317
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:29,501
You've experienced the nightclubs
in our Kaybin district,

318
00:19:29,585 --> 00:19:34,131
so you know the excitement of meeting
a new companion or two,

319
00:19:34,214 --> 00:19:38,677
the intimacy that can develop so quickly
when all parties are receptive.

320
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:41,805
You humans are a truly
remarkable species, Dr. Lucas,

321
00:19:41,889 --> 00:19:43,849
but when <i>Enterprise</i>
has accomplished its mission,

322
00:19:43,932 --> 00:19:49,104
I look forward to being
among Denobulans again...

323
00:19:50,647 --> 00:19:52,524
The more of them, the better.

324
00:19:59,781 --> 00:20:02,034
Good afternoon, Captain.

325
00:20:02,117 --> 00:20:04,203
How are we feeling today?

326
00:20:05,913 --> 00:20:09,166
Ah. Neurochemistry looks excellent.

327
00:20:09,249 --> 00:20:11,001
Theta waves are good.

328
00:20:11,084 --> 00:20:13,587
You should wake up extremely well rested.

329
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:15,214
( creaking )

330
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:22,596
( creaking continues )

331
00:20:37,444 --> 00:20:39,321
( gasping )

332
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:42,658
Phlox to T'Pol.

333
00:20:44,743 --> 00:20:47,955
Internal sensors don't show
any additional bio-signs.

334
00:20:48,038 --> 00:20:50,624
I told you, it was outside of the ship,
on the hull.

335
00:20:50,707 --> 00:20:53,210
There are no life-forms
anywhere in this vicinity.

336
00:20:53,293 --> 00:20:54,795
What about alien vessels?

337
00:20:54,878 --> 00:20:57,589
You can see for yourself
there's nothing there.

338
00:20:59,675 --> 00:21:02,052
You said this reconfigured space
could be affecting our systems.

339
00:21:02,135 --> 00:21:03,679
What if it's interfering with our sensors?

340
00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:05,138
That's possible,

341
00:21:05,222 --> 00:21:07,557
but we should consider
another explanation.

342
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,060
You mentioned you were having difficulty

343
00:21:10,143 --> 00:21:12,688
adjusting to the solitude
of the past few days.

344
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:15,691
I didn't imagine it! I saw something.

345
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:18,443
Outside the ship, crawling on the hull.

346
00:21:20,529 --> 00:21:22,239
What about what I saw in engineering?

347
00:21:22,322 --> 00:21:24,408
You ran the scans yourself.

348
00:21:24,491 --> 00:21:26,410
There is nothing unusual onboard.

349
00:21:32,374 --> 00:21:36,211
You said you haven't slept much
since we entered this disturbance.

350
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:39,673
Perhaps you should return
to your quarters, try to rest.

351
00:21:43,593 --> 00:21:45,637
I need to finish my rounds.

352
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:51,310
( humming )

353
00:22:04,656 --> 00:22:05,949
Get away from her!

354
00:22:06,033 --> 00:22:07,617
( screeching )

355
00:22:17,753 --> 00:22:18,962
( gasps )

356
00:22:41,568 --> 00:22:42,694
( clattering )

357
00:22:42,778 --> 00:22:43,695
( screeching )

358
00:23:00,712 --> 00:23:03,256
-Phlox to T'Pol.
<i>-Go ahead, Doctor.</i>

359
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:06,134
It's the Xindi. They're onboard.

360
00:23:08,637 --> 00:23:10,680
We'll need to arm ourselves. I saw two.

361
00:23:10,764 --> 00:23:12,015
There could be more of them.

362
00:23:12,099 --> 00:23:13,266
There's nothing on the sensors.

363
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:16,103
Then the sensors must be wrong!

364
00:23:16,186 --> 00:23:17,562
Doctor.

365
00:23:18,438 --> 00:23:19,606
Phlox!

366
00:23:20,357 --> 00:23:22,234
I thought you were going to get some rest.

367
00:23:22,317 --> 00:23:24,569
They were real! I saw them!

368
00:23:24,653 --> 00:23:27,572
If that's true,
then how did they get on the ship?

369
00:23:27,656 --> 00:23:28,740
Ah!

370
00:23:28,824 --> 00:23:31,368
All external hatches
and docking ports are sealed.

371
00:23:31,451 --> 00:23:32,953
They could have transporter technology.

372
00:23:33,036 --> 00:23:34,955
There were no transporter signatures.

373
00:23:35,038 --> 00:23:37,290
What difference does it make
how they got onboard?

374
00:23:39,209 --> 00:23:40,919
If we wake up
Lieutenant Reed or the Macos,

375
00:23:41,002 --> 00:23:43,046
they will be incapacitated within minutes,

376
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:44,339
dead within hours.

377
00:23:44,422 --> 00:23:46,883
It is up to us
to deal with this situation.

378
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:52,139
I plan to start on "G" deck
and work my way up.

379
00:23:52,222 --> 00:23:54,850
I'm going to stop them
whether you help me or not.

380
00:24:16,538 --> 00:24:18,415
( sighs )

381
00:25:06,004 --> 00:25:07,756
We've searched four decks.

382
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:09,841
That leaves three to go.

383
00:25:09,925 --> 00:25:13,803
If there are Xindi aboard,
why are they concealing themselves?

384
00:25:13,887 --> 00:25:16,056
They could be trying
to destroy <i>Enterprise.</i>

385
00:25:16,139 --> 00:25:18,016
What better time than while
the crew is incapacitated?

386
00:25:18,099 --> 00:25:20,310
( beeping )

387
00:25:20,393 --> 00:25:21,603
A bio-sign.

388
00:25:21,686 --> 00:25:25,398
There are over 80 bio-signs aboard,
not counting your pets in sick bay.

389
00:25:25,482 --> 00:25:27,067
This isn't human.

390
00:25:27,150 --> 00:25:28,902
Neither are your pets.

391
00:25:28,985 --> 00:25:31,071
Ah. I can't lock onto it.

392
00:25:31,154 --> 00:25:35,242
There must be some interference,
possibly from the reconfigured space.

393
00:25:35,325 --> 00:25:36,910
You said it wasn't affecting our sensors.

394
00:25:36,993 --> 00:25:38,912
I said it wasn't affecting main sensors.

395
00:25:38,995 --> 00:25:41,915
That hand scanner is far less powerful.
You know that.

396
00:25:41,998 --> 00:25:44,000
I have it.

397
00:25:56,054 --> 00:25:57,180
It's just ahead.

398
00:26:00,517 --> 00:26:03,436
( clicking )

399
00:26:11,987 --> 00:26:13,321
Doctor!

400
00:26:17,951 --> 00:26:19,577
( whimpers )

401
00:26:19,661 --> 00:26:20,912
It's all right.

402
00:26:21,788 --> 00:26:25,041
Fortunately, I'm not very proficient
with hand weapons.

403
00:26:25,125 --> 00:26:27,210
How did he get out?

404
00:26:27,294 --> 00:26:30,005
I... I believe I, um...

405
00:26:30,088 --> 00:26:31,298
We went for a walk earlier.

406
00:26:31,381 --> 00:26:34,759
I might have neglected to put him back
in my quarters.

407
00:26:34,843 --> 00:26:36,511
And you simply forgot?

408
00:26:36,594 --> 00:26:38,305
I've been distracted!

409
00:26:38,388 --> 00:26:39,681
I would've thought this
could tell the difference

410
00:26:39,764 --> 00:26:41,808
between a giant insect and a beagle!

411
00:26:41,891 --> 00:26:45,395
-It can, if you use it properly.
-You're the science officer!

412
00:26:45,478 --> 00:26:47,230
You might have offered
some assistance in that area.

413
00:26:47,314 --> 00:26:49,899
You feel I haven't been helpful?

414
00:26:49,983 --> 00:26:52,027
How would you characterize
the two hours I wasted

415
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:54,279
searching for a figment
of your imagination?

416
00:26:54,362 --> 00:26:56,823
-I'm not delusional!
-Are you certain?

417
00:26:56,906 --> 00:26:58,950
As I recall, you once told Ensign Sato

418
00:26:59,034 --> 00:27:02,829
that it's considered healthy
for Denobulans to hallucinate.

419
00:27:02,912 --> 00:27:04,331
It's how you release stress.

420
00:27:04,414 --> 00:27:07,625
You've been under a lot of stress lately,
haven't you, Doctor?

421
00:27:08,626 --> 00:27:09,961
It's not unheard of, but I--

422
00:27:10,045 --> 00:27:11,838
You said you've been having headaches.

423
00:27:12,714 --> 00:27:15,050
Is there anything else
you care to tell me?

424
00:27:15,133 --> 00:27:16,134
I'm fine!

425
00:27:16,217 --> 00:27:17,761
You nearly shot the Captain's dog!

426
00:27:17,844 --> 00:27:21,056
I'm going to recalibrate this
to exclude canine bio-signs,

427
00:27:21,139 --> 00:27:23,558
and then I'm going to finish
searching this ship.

428
00:27:23,641 --> 00:27:26,686
I am not seeing things,
and I intend to prove it!

429
00:27:34,069 --> 00:27:35,070
( computer beeps )

430
00:27:35,153 --> 00:27:37,280
Ensign Sato to the doctor!

431
00:27:41,242 --> 00:27:42,577
Hoshi?

432
00:27:43,787 --> 00:27:45,121
Hoshi?

433
00:27:49,834 --> 00:27:51,336
( water running )

434
00:27:54,255 --> 00:27:55,590
Ensign?

435
00:28:04,682 --> 00:28:06,059
Hoshi?

436
00:28:08,645 --> 00:28:10,397
What are you doing?

437
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,315
I have to put you back
under sedation immediately!

438
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:14,234
You'll suffer permanent damage.

439
00:28:16,736 --> 00:28:18,071
Hoshi.

440
00:28:19,155 --> 00:28:20,281
You did this.

441
00:28:21,116 --> 00:28:22,033
What?

442
00:28:22,826 --> 00:28:24,327
You said we'd be safe.

443
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:26,830
Let me get you to sick bay.

444
00:28:26,913 --> 00:28:28,123
You promised us!

445
00:29:00,196 --> 00:29:01,614
T'Pol...

446
00:29:03,032 --> 00:29:05,660
Please meet me in sick bay immediately.

447
00:29:19,215 --> 00:29:20,800
Where have you been? I was calling you.

448
00:29:20,884 --> 00:29:22,218
( gasps )

449
00:29:22,302 --> 00:29:25,388
Captain... W-what are you doing up?

450
00:29:25,472 --> 00:29:26,890
T'Pol woke me.

451
00:29:26,973 --> 00:29:29,309
She said something was wrong.

452
00:29:29,392 --> 00:29:30,727
I don't know what's happening.

453
00:29:31,227 --> 00:29:33,021
She said you've been seeing things,

454
00:29:33,104 --> 00:29:35,607
something about Xindi onboard the ship.

455
00:29:38,026 --> 00:29:39,277
You're not concerned about that?

456
00:29:40,653 --> 00:29:42,071
I'm more concerned about you.

457
00:29:42,155 --> 00:29:44,282
I obviously expected too much from you.

458
00:29:44,365 --> 00:29:45,909
You're not real.

459
00:29:45,992 --> 00:29:47,494
Why don't you go to your quarters?

460
00:29:47,577 --> 00:29:50,163
Lie down. I'll take over.

461
00:29:50,246 --> 00:29:51,414
You did the best you could.

462
00:29:51,498 --> 00:29:53,291
-You are not real!
-Doctor?

463
00:29:53,374 --> 00:29:55,001
( gasping )

464
00:30:07,555 --> 00:30:09,140
I was so busy monitoring the crew,

465
00:30:09,224 --> 00:30:12,727
I never thought to run
another neural scan on myself.

466
00:30:15,355 --> 00:30:17,941
The effects are subtle
and difficult to detect,

467
00:30:18,024 --> 00:30:22,028
but there are disruptions
deep within my neocortex.

468
00:30:24,823 --> 00:30:26,241
You were right.

469
00:30:27,116 --> 00:30:29,536
I was hallucinating.

470
00:30:32,539 --> 00:30:34,040
Are you in danger?

471
00:30:35,041 --> 00:30:37,794
I don't believe there'll be
any permanent damage.

472
00:30:39,087 --> 00:30:40,797
However, it's obviously
affecting my judgment.

473
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:44,884
I have no choice but to put myself
under neuro-sedation

474
00:30:44,968 --> 00:30:48,137
and ask you to look after the crew.

475
00:30:50,223 --> 00:30:52,392
I don't have the medical expertise.

476
00:30:52,475 --> 00:30:54,561
With your scientific background,
you should have no problems.

477
00:30:54,644 --> 00:30:55,895
I have my own duties.

478
00:30:55,979 --> 00:30:58,940
I can't possibly monitor the entire crew.

479
00:30:59,023 --> 00:30:59,941
It won't be for long.

480
00:31:00,024 --> 00:31:02,569
We'll be coming out
of the disturbance in less than six hours.

481
00:31:03,486 --> 00:31:05,238
T'Pol, I'm asking for your help.

482
00:31:05,321 --> 00:31:06,573
I can't.

483
00:31:06,656 --> 00:31:07,991
Why not?

484
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:14,163
When we were searching the ship,
I... became irritated with you.

485
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:15,999
Apparently I deserved it.

486
00:31:16,082 --> 00:31:17,625
You don't understand.

487
00:31:19,002 --> 00:31:22,046
I was on the verge
of losing control of my emotions.

488
00:31:24,674 --> 00:31:27,719
This reconfigured space
is affecting me as well.

489
00:31:28,678 --> 00:31:30,221
Why didn't you tell me?

490
00:31:30,305 --> 00:31:32,015
I'd hoped to control it,

491
00:31:32,098 --> 00:31:34,684
but it's proven more difficult
than I thought.

492
00:31:34,767 --> 00:31:37,687
The crew is better off in your hands.

493
00:31:39,522 --> 00:31:41,441
I doubt that.

494
00:31:41,524 --> 00:31:43,526
I nearly killed Porthos, remember?

495
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:45,028
What if one of these delusions causes me

496
00:31:45,111 --> 00:31:47,322
to open an airlock
or shut down life support?

497
00:31:47,405 --> 00:31:50,617
-You won't do that.
-How do you know?

498
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:55,455
Because your duty is to look out
for the welfare of this crew.

499
00:31:55,538 --> 00:31:57,999
Why do you think the Captain
allowed you to sedate him

500
00:31:58,082 --> 00:32:00,877
over Commander Tucker's objections?

501
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:04,672
Because he trusts you, as do I.

502
00:32:06,507 --> 00:32:08,509
I'm not sure I trust myself.

503
00:32:08,593 --> 00:32:11,262
Just a few more hours, Doctor.

504
00:32:15,475 --> 00:32:16,601
PHLOX: <i>So, Dr. Lucas, </i>

505
00:32:16,684 --> 00:32:18,895
<i>while the past few days </i>
<i>have proven challenging,</i>

506
00:32:18,978 --> 00:32:24,233
<i>both T'Pol and I are relieved </i>
<i>that our adventure is nearly over. </i>

507
00:32:24,317 --> 00:32:26,611
Once we've confirmed
we're out of the disturbance,

508
00:32:26,694 --> 00:32:29,405
I can begin waking the senior officers.

509
00:32:29,489 --> 00:32:32,033
My medical staff should be next.

510
00:32:32,116 --> 00:32:34,619
They can assist me
with the rest of the, uh...

511
00:32:36,037 --> 00:32:38,289
Well, we should have been
out of the disturbance half an hour ago.

512
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:44,087
There could have been some slight
navigational discrepancies.

513
00:32:44,170 --> 00:32:46,673
I thought space travel
was supposed to be precise.

514
00:32:46,756 --> 00:32:48,591
Not always. Check long-range sensors.

515
00:32:48,675 --> 00:32:50,176
What do you think I'm doing?

516
00:32:53,221 --> 00:32:54,806
There's more than a slight discrepancy.

517
00:32:54,889 --> 00:32:56,224
This can't be correct.

518
00:32:57,266 --> 00:32:59,310
We're nearly a quarter of
a light-year from the far edge.

519
00:32:59,394 --> 00:33:00,728
At our current rate of speed,

520
00:33:00,812 --> 00:33:03,815
we won't be out of this for another...
10 weeks!

521
00:33:14,575 --> 00:33:16,077
Auto-navigation is still engaged.

522
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:18,037
Engines are online. Why aren't we through?

523
00:33:18,121 --> 00:33:19,747
The reconfigured space has expanded.

524
00:33:19,831 --> 00:33:21,082
But we knew it would!

525
00:33:21,165 --> 00:33:23,835
Travis said our course
and speed would compensate.

526
00:33:25,336 --> 00:33:26,254
T'Pol?

527
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:29,882
Obviously the rate
of expansion has accelerated.

528
00:33:29,966 --> 00:33:31,718
We need to increase speed.

529
00:33:31,801 --> 00:33:33,302
We're already at full impulse.

530
00:33:33,386 --> 00:33:34,595
As you can see, that's insufficient.

531
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:35,763
We need to go to warp.

532
00:33:36,389 --> 00:33:37,682
Commander Tucker said
it would be too dangerous.

533
00:33:37,765 --> 00:33:39,017
We don't know what might happen.

534
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:40,518
What do you propose?

535
00:33:40,601 --> 00:33:43,646
Keeping the crew comatose
for the next 10 weeks?

536
00:33:46,065 --> 00:33:48,651
PHLOX: All right. What do we do first?

537
00:33:48,735 --> 00:33:51,446
( voice breaking ) I'm afraid
I may not be of much assistance.

538
00:33:51,529 --> 00:33:53,781
Do I need to keep reminding you
you are the science officer?

539
00:33:53,865 --> 00:33:56,409
I already told you
I'm finding it difficult to focus.

540
00:33:56,492 --> 00:34:00,038
On your worst day, you're more qualified
to operate the warp engines than I am.

541
00:34:00,121 --> 00:34:03,458
Unfortunately, this is by far
one of my worst days.

542
00:34:03,541 --> 00:34:05,710
I'm a physician, not an engineer!

543
00:34:05,793 --> 00:34:07,795
You hold a dozen scientific degrees.

544
00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:09,422
None of them are in warp theory!

545
00:34:09,505 --> 00:34:11,841
( sighs )

546
00:34:11,924 --> 00:34:15,219
The procedures for restarting
the reactor are in the database.

547
00:34:16,512 --> 00:34:19,265
Are you suggesting I read the manual?

548
00:34:23,936 --> 00:34:28,816
"Output must be confined
to within 300 and 312 millicochranes

549
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:31,736
to prevent fusion
of the dilithium matrix."

550
00:34:31,819 --> 00:34:33,905
That seems simple enough.

551
00:34:36,032 --> 00:34:40,453
"Unless the spatial-compression index
is greater than 5.62%

552
00:34:40,536 --> 00:34:43,247
or the ship is within two parsecs

553
00:34:43,331 --> 00:34:47,126
of a class-C
gravimetric field distortion"?

554
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:49,337
I realize this is a complex procedure.

555
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:51,506
Complex? This is utterly baffling.

556
00:34:51,589 --> 00:34:53,299
It might as well be written
in ancient Klingon,

557
00:34:53,382 --> 00:34:56,052
for all the sense I can make of it.

558
00:34:56,135 --> 00:34:57,595
( sighs )

559
00:34:58,763 --> 00:35:00,139
I'm sorry.

560
00:35:00,223 --> 00:35:04,268
I understand.
I just wish I could be more helpful.

561
00:35:04,352 --> 00:35:06,479
You're doing fine.

562
00:35:06,562 --> 00:35:09,690
We have to close the plasma relays
before we can begin the startup sequence.

563
00:35:09,774 --> 00:35:11,442
Would you mind?

564
00:35:13,653 --> 00:35:15,822
What the hell are you doing?

565
00:35:15,905 --> 00:35:18,574
I told you not to mess
with the warp engines.

566
00:35:18,658 --> 00:35:20,076
I don't have time for this.

567
00:35:20,159 --> 00:35:21,953
You better make time, Doc.

568
00:35:22,036 --> 00:35:26,040
I told you, you can't start
the warp reactor inside this disturbance.

569
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:28,292
Actually, you told me
it would be difficult, not impossible.

570
00:35:28,376 --> 00:35:30,753
That machine was designed
to manipulate space,

571
00:35:30,837 --> 00:35:32,964
to violate the laws of motion.

572
00:35:33,047 --> 00:35:35,007
You make the tiniest mistake,

573
00:35:35,091 --> 00:35:37,260
you'll collapse the warp field,
you'll crush this ship.

574
00:35:37,343 --> 00:35:38,636
Thank you for the warning.

575
00:35:38,719 --> 00:35:40,054
You're gonna screw this up, Phlox.

576
00:35:40,138 --> 00:35:41,722
-Go away!
-You're gonna kill everybody!

577
00:35:41,806 --> 00:35:42,932
Can't you see I'm busy?

578
00:35:43,015 --> 00:35:45,685
Doctor! Are you all right?

579
00:35:48,604 --> 00:35:50,064
Fine.

580
00:35:50,148 --> 00:35:51,274
Doctor?

581
00:35:51,983 --> 00:35:54,235
I can't find the plasma relays.

582
00:35:56,195 --> 00:35:57,697
I'll do it myself.

583
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,870
Deuterium pressure is nominal.

584
00:36:03,953 --> 00:36:07,039
Antimatter constrictor coils are online.

585
00:36:07,123 --> 00:36:09,041
Warp 2, hmm, should be sufficient?

586
00:36:09,125 --> 00:36:10,751
Shall we try?

587
00:36:16,674 --> 00:36:18,259
The intermix is stable.

588
00:36:20,469 --> 00:36:22,638
A warp field is forming. ( laughing )

589
00:36:22,722 --> 00:36:25,266
-( computer beeping )
-What's wrong?

590
00:36:25,349 --> 00:36:27,393
I-I-I don't know.

591
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:39,739
I followed the procedures exactly.

592
00:36:39,822 --> 00:36:41,908
-What did I do wrong?
-You need to--

593
00:36:41,991 --> 00:36:43,409
What?

594
00:36:43,492 --> 00:36:45,119
What, T'Pol? Help me!

595
00:36:45,203 --> 00:36:48,164
( stammering )
Is it... The particle confinement?

596
00:36:48,247 --> 00:36:49,707
Perhaps you should increase it.

597
00:36:49,790 --> 00:36:51,000
Well, how do I do that?

598
00:36:52,543 --> 00:36:54,045
Oh!

599
00:36:57,006 --> 00:36:59,091
Particle confinement.

600
00:36:59,175 --> 00:37:01,052
Particle confinement!

601
00:37:03,429 --> 00:37:06,891
Doctor... Perhaps we should
wake Commander Tucker.

602
00:37:06,974 --> 00:37:08,392
He'll die.

603
00:37:08,476 --> 00:37:10,311
If we destroy the ship, we'll all die.

604
00:37:10,394 --> 00:37:12,063
I know.

605
00:37:13,731 --> 00:37:18,277
If we can't accomplish our mission,
billions of people on Earth could die.

606
00:37:18,361 --> 00:37:22,573
Isn't it logical to sacrifice one life
to save so many?

607
00:37:22,657 --> 00:37:24,533
I'm not willing
to make that sacrifice yet!

608
00:37:27,328 --> 00:37:28,955
Particle confinement!

609
00:37:30,873 --> 00:37:33,459
Increase power to magnetic
constriction coils!

610
00:37:41,092 --> 00:37:42,426
T'Pol!

611
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:43,928
Oh, here!

612
00:37:50,559 --> 00:37:52,019
( rumbling stops )

613
00:37:52,103 --> 00:37:53,729
The field is stabilizing.

614
00:37:55,898 --> 00:37:57,275
It's holding.

615
00:37:57,358 --> 00:37:58,901
Then I suggest we go to warp.

616
00:38:00,027 --> 00:38:01,612
Engaging warp engines.

617
00:38:12,748 --> 00:38:13,874
{\an8}Warp 1.1.

618
00:38:15,876 --> 00:38:17,461
1.2.

619
00:38:17,545 --> 00:38:20,089
( whooshing )

620
00:38:20,172 --> 00:38:22,508
Pressure on the hull's increasing.

621
00:38:24,176 --> 00:38:25,303
What are you doing?

622
00:38:25,386 --> 00:38:27,471
Lieutenant Reed insisted
on showing me how to transfer

623
00:38:27,555 --> 00:38:29,265
power to the hull plating...

624
00:38:29,348 --> 00:38:31,142
Just in case.

625
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:38,190
It seems to be working.

626
00:38:38,274 --> 00:38:40,192
{\an8}Warp 1.8.

627
00:38:40,276 --> 00:38:41,360
{\an8}1.9.

628
00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:45,990
Warp 2! ( laughing )

629
00:39:08,554 --> 00:39:10,639
Doctor.

630
00:39:10,723 --> 00:39:13,059
Ah, ah, ah! Lie still.

631
00:39:13,142 --> 00:39:15,936
Your neocortex may need
a few moments to warm up.

632
00:39:18,773 --> 00:39:21,359
Are we th-through the disturbance?

633
00:39:21,442 --> 00:39:25,154
Yes. I'll begin waking
the rest of the crew shortly.

634
00:39:25,821 --> 00:39:27,907
Any...problems?

635
00:39:29,158 --> 00:39:33,537
Oh, a few minor glitches.
It will all be in my log.

636
00:39:33,621 --> 00:39:34,622
( sighs )

637
00:39:34,705 --> 00:39:37,541
If you're feeling up to it,
you have a visitor.

638
00:39:39,668 --> 00:39:41,545
Oh, hey.

639
00:39:44,799 --> 00:39:46,425
Thanks, Doctor.

640
00:39:48,511 --> 00:39:50,012
How are you feeling?

641
00:39:50,096 --> 00:39:52,223
-A little woozy.
-I'm not surprised.

642
00:39:52,306 --> 00:39:54,642
You haven't eaten anything in four days.

643
00:39:54,725 --> 00:39:56,268
Get to the mess hall.

644
00:39:56,352 --> 00:39:58,187
Aye, aye, Doc.

645
00:40:03,192 --> 00:40:05,945
-I'll assist you in waking the others.
-Oh, that won't be necessary.

646
00:40:06,028 --> 00:40:09,281
I appreciate the offer,
but, uh, you need some rest.

647
00:40:09,365 --> 00:40:11,450
Let me walk you to your quarters.

648
00:40:11,534 --> 00:40:14,078
-Doctor's orders?
-Mm-hmm.

649
00:40:21,419 --> 00:40:22,878
-Thank you.
-Mm-hmm.

650
00:40:24,088 --> 00:40:27,675
I'll stop by and check on you
in a few hours.

651
00:40:49,238 --> 00:40:51,198
PHLOX: <i>As you might guess, Dr. Lucas,</i>

652
00:40:51,282 --> 00:40:54,577
<i>I had considered deleting this letter </i>
<i>and starting over,</i>

653
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:57,413
<i>since large sections of it</i>
<i>are now obviously fictitious.</i>

654
00:40:57,496 --> 00:41:00,166
<i>However, I decided that </i>
<i>my delusional account</i>

655
00:41:00,249 --> 00:41:02,001
<i>would probably prove entertaining.</i>

656
00:41:02,084 --> 00:41:04,587
<i>As always, you have my best wishes.</i>

657
00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:08,382
<i>Your friend and colleague, Phlox.</i>

658
00:41:08,466 --> 00:41:10,342
May I join you?

659
00:41:10,426 --> 00:41:11,552
Of course.

660
00:41:13,012 --> 00:41:14,472
( sighs )

661
00:41:15,514 --> 00:41:16,640
Commander Tucker was complaining

662
00:41:16,724 --> 00:41:19,310
that it will take him days
to realign the warp coils.

663
00:41:19,852 --> 00:41:21,604
( laughs )

664
00:41:21,687 --> 00:41:23,731
Yes, he gave me quite a talking to.

665
00:41:24,273 --> 00:41:26,817
He also said, and I quote,

666
00:41:26,901 --> 00:41:28,694
"Phlox did one hell of a job."

667
00:41:30,446 --> 00:41:32,406
MAN: Oh. Excuse me, Doctor.

668
00:41:35,117 --> 00:41:37,161
You must have enjoyed
having the ship to yourself.

669
00:41:38,871 --> 00:41:41,624
It wasn't nearly as empty
as I anticipated.
