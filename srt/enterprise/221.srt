MY GRANDMOTHER LIVED
THROUGH THE LAST WAR.

515
00:30:24,948 --> 00:30:27,493

517
00:30:29,202 --> 00:30:30,788

523
00:30:42,549 --> 00:30:46,679

ABOUT THE ANTARANS,

I TOLD THEM THE TRUTH,

I TOLD THEM
ABOUT OUR MILITARY CAMPAIGNS

ABOUT HOW WE HAD DEMONIZED YOU,

528

540
00:31:28,721 --> 00:31:31,724

WAS SEDUCED BY THOSE PEOPLE.

541

I DID MY BEST
TO CONVINCE HIM HE WAS MISTAKEN.

542

I TOLD HIM I WOULDN'T TOLERATE

THE VALUES HE WAS EMBRACING.

544
00:31:37,062 --> 00:31:39,773
IT CREATED A RIFT BETWEEN US.

TO REACH HIM.

ONE OF MY CREWMEN

678
00:39:53,725 --> 00:39:55,185
WHO WAS INJURED ON THE SURFACE.

679
00:39:55,227 --> 00:39:57,145
HUDAK:
THAT'S ALL RIGHT, CAPTAIN.

680
00:39:57,187 --> 00:40:00,023
THE DOCTOR AND I SPENT MORE
THAN ENOUGH TIME TOGETHER.

681
00:40:00,065 --> 00:40:02,108
ARCHER:
IT'S TOO BAD YOUR RESEARCH

682
00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:04,236
ON XANTORAS WAS CUT SHORT.

683
00:40:04,277 --> 00:40:07,239
HUDAK: THE TIME I SPENT ON YOUR
SHIP WAS AN EDUCATION IN ITSELF.

684
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:09,366
THANK YOU FOR YOUR HELP.

685
00:40:11,951 --> 00:40:13,661
ARCHER: YOU DO KNOW WE CAME HERE

686
00:40:13,703 --> 00:40:16,039
TO RESCUE THREE DENOBULAN
GEOLOGISTS?

687
00:40:16,081 --> 00:40:18,250
HUDAK: PHLOX TOLD ME.

688
00:40:18,291 --> 00:40:21,460
ARCHER: I UNDERSTAND THEY'LL BE
HEADING HOME ON YOUR TRANSPORT.

689
00:40:21,502 --> 00:40:23,213
I HOPE THAT WON'T BE A PROBLEM.

690
00:40:23,255 --> 00:40:25,048
HUDAK: HAVE THEY BEEN INFORMED

691
00:40:25,090 --> 00:40:26,883
THAT I'LL BE TRAVELING
WITH THEM?

692
00:40:26,925 --> 00:40:29,677
ARCHER: I HAD A TALK WITH THEM.

693
00:40:29,719 --> 00:40:31,179
HUDAK:
AND WHAT WAS THEIR RESPONSE?

694
00:40:31,221 --> 00:40:34,682
ARCHER: THEY'RE WILLING
IF YOU ARE.

695
00:41:05,755 --> 00:41:08,049
PHLOX:
COMPUTER, BEGIN RECORDING.

696
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:15,265
DEAR METTUS, I KNOW IT'S BEEN
SOME TIME SINCE I'VE WRITTEN,

697
00:41:15,307 --> 00:41:19,394
AND I KNOW CHANCES ARE SLIM THAT
YOU'LL RESPOND TO THIS LETTER.

698
00:41:19,436 --> 00:41:22,939
HOWEVER, SOMETHING HAS HAPPENED

699
00:41:22,981 --> 00:41:27,110
THAT COMPELS ME TO TRY
TO REACH YOU AGAIN.

700
00:41:27,152 --> 00:41:33,158
I'VE HAD AN EXPERIENCE
THAT HAS OPENED MANY OLD WOUNDS.

701
00:41:33,199 --> 00:41:36,244
AS PAINFUL AS IT'S BEEN,

702
00:41:36,286 --> 00:41:39,205
IT'S ALSO CHANGED
SOMETHING IN ME.

703
00:41:40,957 --> 00:41:44,543
I HOPE, IF YOU'RE
WILLING TO LISTEN,

704
00:41:44,585 --> 00:41:47,297
IT MIGHT BEGIN TO CHANGE
SOMETHING IN YOU.
