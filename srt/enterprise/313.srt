KNOW EARTH HAD BEEN ATTACKED?

174
00:09:16,515 --> 00:09:19,559
SEVEN MILLION KILLED?
NOT EXACTLY A STATE SECRET.

175
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:21,769
ESPECIALLY IF YOU'RE
MONITORING COMMUNICATIONS

176
00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:24,147
BETWEEN STARFLEET
AND THE VULCAN HIGH COMMAND.

177
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:29,319
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR UNIFORM,
SUBCOMMANDER?

178
00:09:30,862 --> 00:09:34,574
NOT THAT I DON'T FIND
YOUR NEW LOOK BECOMING, BUT...

179
00:09:35,909 --> 00:09:39,913
...IT'S NOT EXACTLY REGULATION,
IS IT?

180
00:09:39,913 --> 00:09:41,915
I RESIGNED MY COMMISSION.

181
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:44,918
YES, I BELIEVE I HEARD
SOMETHING ABOUT THAT.

182
00:09:44,918 --> 00:09:47,087
WHY ARE YOU HERE?

183
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:51,674
YOUR WORLD IS IN JEOPARDY,

184
00:09:51,674 --> 00:09:56,054
AND WHERE ARE YOUR FRIENDS,
THE VULCANS?

185
00:09:56,054 --> 00:09:58,806
WHERE IS THEIR MIGHTY FLEET?

186
00:09:58,806 --> 00:10:02,102
THEY COULDN'T EVEN SPARE
ONE OFFICER.

187
00:10:02,102 --> 00:10:06,523
SHE WAS FORCED TO ABANDON HER
CAREER TO REMAIN ON YOUR SHIP.

188
00:10:06,523 --> 00:10:09,609
A REMARKABLY SELFLESS ACT.

189
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:12,070
FOR A VULCAN.

190
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:13,905
BUT WE'VE COME TO YOUR AID.

191
00:10:13,905 --> 00:10:17,409
WE'VE COME INTO THE EXPANSE
WHEN THEY REFUSED.

192
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:21,162
WE'RE HERE TO HELP YOU.

193
00:10:21,162 --> 00:10:23,415
IF YOU DON'T
WANT OUR ASSISTANCE,

194
00:10:23,415 --> 00:10:27,210
THEN WE'LL LEAVE YOU TO DEAL
WITH THE XINDI ON YOUR OWN.

195
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:29,254
JUST LIKE THE VULCANS HAVE DONE.

197

WE'RE DAMN LUCKY THE TORPEDOES
WERE ALL IN SAFE MODE.

198

200
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:42,309
THEY HAVEN'T EVEN GOT ENOUGH
POWER TO LIGHT A CAMPFIRE.

201
00:10:42,309 --> 00:10:44,018
HOW LONG TO FIX THEM?

202
00:10:44,018 --> 00:10:46,605
I COULDN'T EVEN GUESS WITHOUT
A CHANCE TO SORT THIS OUT.

203
00:10:47,522 --> 00:10:49,274
COMMANDER SHRAN OFFERED TO

204
00:10:49,274 --> 00:10:52,611
SEND HIS TACTICAL OFFICER OVER
TO HELP.

205
00:10:52,611 --> 00:10:54,529
WE'D BE GIVING THEM ACCESS
TO CRITICAL SYSTEMS, SIR.

206
00:10:54,529 --> 00:10:56,364
THE KEMOCITE SIGNAL
HOSHI PICKED UP

207
00:10:56,364 --> 00:10:58,158
COULD LEAD US
TO THE XINDI WEAPON.

208
00:10:58,158 --> 00:11:00,452
WE'RE GOING TO NEED
OUR DEFENSES.

209
00:11:03,538 --> 00:11:05,832
I DON'T LIKE THE IDEA OF HAVING
THE ANDORIANS DOWN HERE

210
00:11:05,832 --> 00:11:08,251
ANY MORE THAN YOU DO.

211
00:11:08,251 --> 00:11:09,961
BUT WE COULD USE THEIR HELP.

212
00:11:12,671 --> 00:11:14,007

213
00:11:29,189 --> 00:11:30,649

HAS DOCKED.

214
00:11:30,649 --> 00:11:32,442
GOOD.
LET'S PUT THEM TO WORK.

215
00:11:32,442 --> 00:11:35,903
I RECOMMEND WE ASSIGN A SECURITY
DETAIL TO EACH REPAIR CREW.

216
00:11:35,903 --> 00:11:38,198
YOU'VE BEEN TALKING
TO LIEUTENANT REED?

THEY'RE HERE TO HELP, T'POL.

218
00:11:41,368 --> 00:11:43,744
THAT DOESN'T MEAN
WE SHOULDN'T EXERCISE CAUTION.

219
00:11:43,744 --> 00:11:46,831
I'M NOT GONNA ASK THEM TO WORK
WITH GUNS AT THEIR HEADS

220
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:49,125
JUST BECAUSE
YOU DON'T LIKE THEM.

221
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:52,128
I NEITHER LIKE
NOR DISLIKE ANDORIANS.

222
00:11:52,128 --> 00:11:54,506
I'VE SIMPLY HAD A GREAT DEAL
OF EXPERIENCE WITH THEM.

I APPRECIATE THAT.

224
00:11:56,257 --> 00:11:58,968
BUT WHATEVER PROBLEMS
EXIST BETWEEN VULCAN AND ANDORIA

225
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:00,303
DON'T INVOLVE US.

226

SO ANTAGONISTIC, CAPTAIN.

IN FACT, DESPITE THEIR
HEIGHTENED EMOTIONS,

00:12:07,477 --> 00:12:12,023
OUR FIRST CONTACT WITH ANDORIANS
SEEMED PROMISING.

230
00:12:12,023 --> 00:12:13,900
WHAT HAPPENED?

231
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:15,734
THEY WERE DUPLICITOUS.

232
00:12:15,734 --> 00:12:17,153
THEY ONLY HONORED AGREEMENTS

233
00:12:17,153 --> 00:12:19,822
THAT DIDN'T CONFLICT
WITH THEIR INTERESTS.

234
00:12:19,822 --> 00:12:22,659
IS THAT YOUR ASSESSMENT,
OR THE HIGH COMMAND'S?

235
00:12:22,659 --> 00:12:24,703
CONSIDERING THE IMPORTANCE
OF THIS MISSION,

236
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:26,246
I FEEL COMPELLED
TO POINT OUT

237
00:12:26,246 --> 00:12:29,249
THAT THEY'VE PROVEN
UNTRUSTWORTHY IN THE PAST.

238

I DON'T TRUST THEM EITHER,
T'POL.

00:12:36,964 --> 00:12:39,384
