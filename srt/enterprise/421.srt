I also understand Paxton's tapped

No one can get within 1,000 kilometers

00:08:24,712 --> 00:08:26,714
-And you're going to tell me how.
-What makes you think

00:08:26,797 --> 00:08:28,341
I even have that information?

146
00:08:28,966 --> 00:08:31,802
Because your section routinely
thinks about the unthinkable,

147
00:08:32,303 --> 00:08:35,097
And because you'd never miss
a chance to put me in your debt.

148
00:08:35,389 --> 00:08:36,641
You're a good judge of character.

149
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:41,103
The grid was designed to function
in the planet's original atmosphere,

150
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:43,105
But terra forming's made the air
much thicker.

151
00:08:43,439 --> 00:08:44,649
How does that help us?

152
00:08:46,817 --> 00:08:49,737
Sections of the grid
continually need recalibration

153
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:51,322
And are prone to false signals.

154
00:08:51,405 --> 00:08:53,324
You can exploit that weakness.

155
00:08:53,407 --> 00:08:55,243
The good news is, with terraforming,

156
00:08:55,326 --> 00:08:57,703
There's no more need for pressure suits
in the lowland.

157
00:08:57,787 --> 00:09:00,039
Oxygen, yes.
Thermal garments.

158
00:09:00,122 --> 00:09:02,291
According to this, if we keep our altitude

159
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:05,169
Less than 10 meters above the surface,
Paxton won't see us.

160
00:09:05,253 --> 00:09:07,672
You'll still need
to reach the surface undetected.

161
00:09:07,755 --> 00:09:11,425
That part's taken care of,
without your help.

162
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:16,472
So, the student has surpassed the teacher.

163
00:09:18,474 --> 00:09:21,185
When you're finished with Mars,
why don't you come work for me?

164
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:23,813
I've got quite enough to keep me busy
on <i>Enterprise.</i>

"Postpone" is a diplomatic way

When you invited me to join this crew,

Fellow delegates, this last week,

00:36:24,724 --> 00:36:28,186

can be at their worst.

But we cannot, we must not

the dream that began here.

For then the demons
of our past will have won.

571

Instead, I want to look to the future

572
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:47,496

Up until about 100 years ago,

576
00:37:04,805 --> 00:37:07,225
There was one question
that burned in every human

577
00:37:08,434 --> 00:37:11,938
That made us study the stars
and dream of traveling to them.

Are we alone?
