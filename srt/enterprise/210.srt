<i>IT'S AS EASY AS ONE, TWO...</i>

684
00:39:17,689 --> 00:39:20,775
REED: THREE.

685
00:39:20,817 --> 00:39:22,485
TUCKER: NICE WORK, MALCOLM.

686
00:39:22,527 --> 00:39:24,946
SEE, I TOLD YOU,
PIECE OF CAKE.

687
00:39:24,988 --> 00:39:26,489
HOSHI: WHERE ARE THEY?
WE'VE GOT TO STOP THEM.

688
00:39:26,531 --> 00:39:28,158
TUCKER: WHO?

689
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:29,575
HOSHI: YOU HEARD ME?
YOU CAN HEAR ME?

690
00:39:29,617 --> 00:39:30,910
DO YOU SEE ME?

691
00:39:30,952 --> 00:39:32,745
-EVERYTHING'S FINE, HOSHI.
-IT'S NOT FINE.

692
00:39:32,787 --> 00:39:34,289
THEY PUT BOMB
ON THE WARP REACTOR!

693
00:39:34,331 --> 00:39:36,166
-WHO?
-THE ALIENS FROM THE SURFACE.

694
00:39:36,208 --> 00:39:38,501
THERE'S NO ONE ON THE SURFACE.
IT'S UNINHABITED.

695
00:39:38,543 --> 00:39:40,128
HOSHI: WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

696
00:39:40,170 --> 00:39:43,298
THEY KIDNAPPED YOU AND TRAVIS!
WE'VE GOT TO STOP THEM!

697
00:39:43,340 --> 00:39:46,051
REED: HOSHI, THE TRANSPORTER
WAS AFFECTED BY THE STORMS.

698
00:39:46,092 --> 00:39:48,803
I HAD SOME TROUBLE REINTEGRATING
YOUR MATTER STREAM.

699
00:39:48,845 --> 00:39:51,348
HOSHI: TROUBLE?

700
00:39:51,389 --> 00:39:55,018
TUCKER: YOU WERE SORT OF...
TRAPPED IN THE PATTERN BUFFER,

701
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:56,728
BUT ONLY FOR A FEW SECONDS.

702
00:39:56,769 --> 00:39:59,564
8.3 SECONDS, TO BE PRECISE.

703
00:39:59,605 --> 00:40:03,902
HOSHI: ARE YOU SAYING THAT I
WAS JUST ON THE SURFACE?

704
00:40:03,943 --> 00:40:07,072
TUCKER: YOU INSISTED ON
GOING SECOND.

705
00:40:10,449 --> 00:40:11,743
DO YOU HAVE A MIRROR?

706
00:40:11,784 --> 00:40:13,411
WHAT?

707
00:40:16,373 --> 00:40:18,666
FORGET IT.

708
00:40:18,708 --> 00:40:22,212
AND I WAS SURE I WAS GOING
TO BE THE NEXT CYRUS RAMSEY.

709
00:40:22,921 --> 00:40:24,589
CYRUS WHO?

710
00:40:34,099 --> 00:40:37,936
SO YOU'RE SAYING ALL OF THAT
HAPPENED IN EIGHT SECONDS?

711
00:40:37,977 --> 00:40:39,938
PHLOX: ACTUALLY, IT PROBABLY
HAPPENED IN THE LAST

712
00:40:39,979 --> 00:40:43,900
ONE OR TWO SECONDS...AS YOUR
MATTER STREAM WAS COALESCING.

713
00:40:43,942 --> 00:40:46,111
SHE SEEMS FINE.

714
00:40:48,654 --> 00:40:51,116
ARCHER: MALCOLM IS RECOMMENDING
SOME NEW TRANSPORT PROTOCOLS

715
00:40:51,157 --> 00:40:53,910
TO STARFLEET.

716
00:40:53,952 --> 00:40:58,081
HE'S SUGGESTING WE START
COMPRESSING THE TRANSPORT BEAM.

717
00:40:58,123 --> 00:41:01,542
HOSHI: WELL, I HOPE YOU DON'T
PLAN ON BEAMING ME ANYWHERE

718
00:41:01,584 --> 00:41:03,544
FOR A LONG TIME.

719
00:41:03,586 --> 00:41:06,547
ARCHER: BUT YOU SAID YOU STEPPED
ONTO THE ALIENS' TRANSPORTER

720
00:41:06,589 --> 00:41:07,799
BY CHOICE.

721
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:10,760
HOSHI: I WAS TRYING
TO SAVE<i> ENTERPRISE.</i>

722
00:41:10,802 --> 00:41:12,887
ARCHER: SOUNDS LIKE
YOU OVERCAME YOUR FEAR.

723
00:41:12,929 --> 00:41:15,348
HOSHI: IT'S ALL IN MY HEAD,
REMEMBER?

724
00:41:15,390 --> 00:41:17,100
ARCHER: DOES IT MATTER?

725
00:41:17,142 --> 00:41:20,686
YOU WERE AFRAID OF GETTING LOST,
AFRAID OF DISAPPEARING...

726
00:41:20,728 --> 00:41:23,189
BUT YOU STILL CLIMBED
ONTO THAT PLATFORM,

727
00:41:23,231 --> 00:41:25,066
REAL OR NOT.

728
00:41:25,108 --> 00:41:27,402
HOSHI: IF IT'S ALL THE SAME
TO YOU, SIR,

729
00:41:27,444 --> 00:41:30,905
I'D LIKE TO STICK TO SHUTTLEPODS
FOR THE TIME BEING.

730
00:41:30,947 --> 00:41:33,450
ARCHER: COME ON.

731
00:41:33,491 --> 00:41:35,994
LET'S GO TO THE BRIDGE.

732
00:41:36,035 --> 00:41:40,081
HOSHI: CAPTAIN--AHEM--
IF YOU DON'T MIND...

733
00:41:44,294 --> 00:41:47,088
[ DOOR OPENS ]
