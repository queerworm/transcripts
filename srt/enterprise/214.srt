THEY'RE KIND OF LIKE

BACK AND FORTH.

T'POL: THAT WAS TO BE EXPECTED.

835
00:40:27,425 --> 00:40:30,803
ARCHER: THEY OFFERED HIM
A HEARING, BUT HE REFUSED.

836
00:40:32,389 --> 00:40:34,391
ORATT SAID
HE'LL LOSE HIS STANDING

837
00:40:34,432 --> 00:40:36,184
WITH THE MEDICAL EXCHANGE

838
00:40:36,226 --> 00:40:38,019
WHEN THEY GET BACK TO VULCAN.

839
00:40:38,061 --> 00:40:40,688
T'POL: ALSO TO BE EXPECTED.

840
00:40:40,730 --> 00:40:45,777
ARCHER: ONE GOOD THING
DID COME OUT OF THIS.

841
00:40:48,738 --> 00:40:53,201
THEY BELIEVED HIM WHEN
HE SAID YOU WERE FORCED.

842
00:40:58,539 --> 00:41:00,625
YOU'RE NOT GONNA BE RECALLED.

843
00:41:05,422 --> 00:41:07,465
T'POL: WITH YOUR PERMISSION,

844
00:41:07,506 --> 00:41:09,550
I'LL BE CONTACTING
THE HIGH COMMAND.

845
00:41:09,592 --> 00:41:14,264
I DON'T INTEND TO LET YURIS BE
DISMISSED WITHOUT A FIGHT.

846
00:41:14,306 --> 00:41:16,266
ARCHER: PERMISSION GRANTED.

847
00:41:18,101 --> 00:41:20,728
I KNOW YOU MUST
BE VERY DISAPPOINTED

848
00:41:20,770 --> 00:41:23,273
THAT HE BROKE
HIS PROMISE TO YOU.

849
00:41:23,315 --> 00:41:27,068
BUT ON A SELFISH NOTE,
I'M GLAD HE DID.

850
00:41:29,404 --> 00:41:31,614
I DIDN'T WANT TO LOSE YOU.

851
00:41:34,326 --> 00:41:37,203
T'POL: MAYBE THIS INCIDENT
WILL ENCOURAGE OTHERS

852
00:41:37,245 --> 00:41:39,414
TO SPEAK OUT.

853
00:41:42,792 --> 00:41:44,877
ARCHER: WELL, LET'S HOPE SO.
