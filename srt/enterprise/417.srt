TO THIS INCIDENT.

691
00:39:03,133 --> 00:39:04,968
AT LEAST WE'VE LEARNED
SOMETHING ABOUT THE ORIONS.

692
00:39:04,968 --> 00:39:06,678
YEAH, THE WOMEN ARE IN CHARGE.

693
00:39:06,678 --> 00:39:09,430
IT PROVES THAT EVEN
THE MOST DISAGREEABLE SPECIES

694
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:12,851
HAVE SOME POSITIVE ATTRIBUTES.

695
00:39:14,352 --> 00:39:16,813
WAS THAT MY IMAGINATION?

696
00:39:16,813 --> 00:39:19,565
I DON'T THINK SO.

697
00:39:19,565 --> 00:39:21,943
IT ALMOST SOUNDED LIKE
YOU WERE MAKING A JOKE.

698
00:39:21,943 --> 00:39:23,611
AT LEAST TRYING TO MAKE ONE.

699
00:39:23,611 --> 00:39:27,073
I ASSURE YOU, IF I EVER
DECIDE TO MAKE A JOKE,

700
00:39:27,073 --> 00:39:29,326
YOU'LL KNOW ABOUT IT.

701
00:39:29,326 --> 00:39:30,994
THERE IT IS AGAIN.

702
00:39:30,994 --> 00:39:33,246
T'POL, IF
I DIDN'T KNOW BETTER,

703
00:39:33,246 --> 00:39:35,957
I'D THINK YOU WERE PICKING UP
SOME OF TRIP'S BAD HABITS.

704
00:39:40,003 --> 00:39:42,214
I GUESS WE PROVED IT AGAIN.

705
00:39:42,214 --> 00:39:43,840
PROVED WHAT?

706
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:46,592
THAT YOU AND I
MAKE A HELL OF A TEAM.

707
00:39:46,592 --> 00:39:48,803
WE DO SEEM
TO WORK WELL TOGETHER.

708
00:39:48,803 --> 00:39:52,682
EVEN MORE NOW THAT WE'RE
IN EACH OTHER'S HEADS.

709
00:39:54,142 --> 00:39:56,102
YOU'RE RETURNING TO<i> COLUMBIA?</i>

710
00:39:56,102 --> 00:39:58,104
I IMAGINE CAPTAIN HERNANDEZ

711
00:39:58,104 --> 00:40:00,023
IS GETTING PRETTY ANTSY
TO HAVE HER CHIEF ENGINEER BACK.

712
00:40:00,023 --> 00:40:03,026
THERE ARE STILL NUMEROUS REPAIRS
TO BE CARRIED OUT HERE.

713
00:40:03,026 --> 00:40:04,443
I THINK KELBY CAN HANDLE THEM.

714
00:40:04,443 --> 00:40:07,030
HE'D BEEN OBSERVING MY WORK
PRETTY CAREFULLY

715
00:40:07,030 --> 00:40:09,407
WHEN HE WASN'T TRYING
TO BLOW UP THE SHIP.

716
00:40:09,407 --> 00:40:12,077
KELBY IS A FINE ENGINEER,
BUT HE LACKS EXPERIENCE.

717
00:40:12,077 --> 00:40:14,037
WHY DON'T YOU JUST SAY IT?

718
00:40:14,037 --> 00:40:16,164
SAY WHAT?

719
00:40:16,164 --> 00:40:17,999
THAT YOU WANT ME TO COME BACK.

720
00:40:17,999 --> 00:40:20,043
I BELIEVE I DID.

721
00:40:21,544 --> 00:40:23,504
I THINK YOUR PRESENCE HERE

722
00:40:23,504 --> 00:40:25,965
WOULD BE EXTREMELY BENEFICIAL
TO OUR OPERATIONS.

723
00:40:25,965 --> 00:40:30,303
NO.
THAT YOU WANT ME BACK.

724
00:40:31,596 --> 00:40:33,348
I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN.

725
00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:38,811
MY MISTAKE.
SEE YOU AROUND.

726
00:40:38,811 --> 00:40:41,522
WAIT. TRIP.

727
00:40:46,903 --> 00:40:48,529
I WANT YOU TO COME BACK.

728
00:40:52,033 --> 00:40:54,077
THEN I'LL THINK ABOUT IT.

729
00:40:54,077 --> 00:40:55,995
TRIP!

730
00:41:07,632 --> 00:41:12,262
THREE DAYS AGO,
I TOLD CAPTAIN HERNANDEZ

731
00:41:12,262 --> 00:41:15,098
I WANTED A TRANSFER
BACK TO<i> ENTERPRISE.</i>

732
00:41:15,098 --> 00:41:16,849
THREE DAYS AGO?

733
00:41:16,849 --> 00:41:19,185
I REALIZED THIS IS
WHERE I WAS MEANT TO BE

734
00:41:19,185 --> 00:41:23,148
AND THAT, UH,
THIS THING BETWEEN US

735
00:41:23,148 --> 00:41:26,192
ISN'T THAT BIG OF A DEAL.

736
00:41:26,192 --> 00:41:28,653
AGREED.

737
00:41:28,653 --> 00:41:32,490
GUESS WE GOT
A LOT OF WORK TO DO.
