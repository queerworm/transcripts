WE JUST STUCK OUR HANDS

507
00:27:53,964 --> 00:27:56,300

LETS YOU READ
EACH OTHER'S MINDS.

510
00:27:59,386 --> 00:28:01,013

BUT THEY COULD HAVE SERVED
AS THE TRANSFERAL MEDIUM.

516

T'POL: ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS
A DIPLOMAT LEARNS

517
00:28:14,692 --> 00:28:18,780
IS NOT TO STICK HIS FINGERS
WHERE THEY DON'T BELONG.

IT'LL TAKE YOUR FINGERS
RIGHT OFF.

548
00:29:55,877 --> 00:29:58,547
DILLARD: WHY WOULD SOMEONE
PUT THEIR HANDS THERE, SIR?

549
00:30:00,507 --> 00:30:02,092
TUCKER: OH.

00:30:05,095 --> 00:30:07,347
