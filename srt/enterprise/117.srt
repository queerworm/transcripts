TOLARIS: I UNDERSTAND.

706
00:37:54,313 --> 00:37:57,067
WELL, IF THERE'S NOTHING MORE,
CAPTAIN,

707
00:37:57,109 --> 00:37:59,111
I'M EAGER TO GET BACK TO WORK.

708

IN SICK BAY.

FROM WHAT THE DOCTOR TELLS ME,

714
00:38:16,586 --> 00:38:18,671
SHE'S IN PRETTY BAD SHAPE.

715

TOLARIS: THAT'S UNFORTUNATE.

716
00:38:20,465 --> 00:38:22,008
WHAT HAPPENED?

717
00:38:22,050 --> 00:38:24,594
ARCHER: YOU KNOW DAMN WELL
WHAT HAPPENED.

718
00:38:24,636 --> 00:38:27,139
SHE TOLD ME ABOUT YOUR--

719
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:30,558
WHAT DID SHE CALL IT?--
MIND-MELD.

720
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:34,771
SHE SAID WHEN SHE ASKED YOU
TO STOP, YOU GOT ANGRY.

721
00:38:34,813 --> 00:38:37,983
SHE SAID SHE HAD TO
FORCE YOU AWAY.

722
00:38:38,024 --> 00:38:41,360
TOLARIS: WHAT HAPPENED BETWEEN
US IS PERSONAL.

723
00:38:41,402 --> 00:38:43,196
IT'S NOT YOUR CONCERN.

724
00:38:43,238 --> 00:38:44,990
ARCHER: YOU ASSAULTED
A MEMBER OF MY CREW.

725
00:38:45,031 --> 00:38:46,532
TOLARIS: I DID NO SUCH THING.

726
00:38:46,574 --> 00:38:49,661
MIND-MELDS CAN BE
EMOTIONALLY TURBULENT.

727
00:38:49,702 --> 00:38:51,454
SHE SIMPLY PANICKED.

728
00:38:51,496 --> 00:38:54,166
ARCHER: PANIC DOESN'T LAND YOU
IN SICK BAY.

729
00:38:54,207 --> 00:38:56,168
OUR DOCTOR SAID
SHE COULD HAVE SUFFERED

730
00:38:56,209 --> 00:38:58,878
NEUROLOGICAL DAMAGE
THANKS TO YOU.

731
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:00,630
TOLARIS: NO ONE FORCED HER
TO TRY THE MELD.

732
00:39:00,672 --> 00:39:02,299
SHE DID IT WILLINGLY.

733
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:03,883
ARCHER:
YOU'VE BEEN MANIPULATING HER

734
00:39:03,925 --> 00:39:05,593
EVER SINCE YOU CAME ABOARD.

735
00:39:05,635 --> 00:39:07,095
TOLARIS: I AM HELPING HER SHED

736
00:39:07,137 --> 00:39:08,554
A LIFETIME OF REPRESSION.

737

AND YOU, OF ALL PEOPLE,

738
00:39:10,015 --> 00:39:11,808

WHAT I'M TRYING TO DO.

742
00:39:17,563 --> 00:39:19,191
STAY AWAY FROM HER.

743
00:39:19,232 --> 00:39:21,442
TOLARIS: SHE IS IN A CRUCIAL
STAGE OF HER AWAKENING.

744
00:39:21,484 --> 00:39:22,902
SHE NEEDS GUIDANCE.

745
00:39:22,944 --> 00:39:24,362
I TOLD YOU, IT'S OVER.

746
00:39:24,403 --> 00:39:26,990
TOLARIS: I THINK THAT'S FOR HER
TO DECIDE.

747
00:39:27,032 --> 00:39:29,284

MAKING MYSELF CLEAR.

IN MY WAY, CAPTAIN.

00:39:32,871 --> 00:39:35,248
YOU'D BE WISE TO LET ME LEAVE.

ARCHER: WHAT'S WRONG, TOLARIS?

752
00:39:36,791 --> 00:39:38,210
GETTING ANGRY?

753
00:39:38,251 --> 00:39:41,213

UNDER CONTROL.

00:39:41,254 --> 00:39:42,588
TOLARIS: MOVE ASIDE.

YOU'VE GOT A TEMPER.

00:40:08,365 --> 00:40:10,658
I WAS GONNA GET THROWN
ACROSS THE ROOM THAT HARD,

761
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:13,494

A DIFFERENT APPROACH.
