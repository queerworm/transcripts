1
00:00:02,002 --> 00:00:03,170
<i>PREVIOUSLY ON "ENTERPRISE"...</i>

2
00:00:03,211 --> 00:00:04,588
WE'RE 400 YEARS IN THE FUTURE.

3
00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:06,674
YOU KNOW ABOUT
THE ALIEN WE FOUND?

4
00:00:06,715 --> 00:00:08,300
<i>THE TEST SUBJECT?</i>

5
00:00:08,342 --> 00:00:10,260
HE BELONGS TO THE SAME RACE
THAT BUILT THE SPHERES.

6
00:00:10,302 --> 00:00:11,553
THEY'RE ALTERING THIS SPACE

7
00:00:11,595 --> 00:00:13,054
TO MAKE IT HABITABLE
FOR THEIR SPECIES.

8
00:00:13,096 --> 00:00:14,348
YOU HAVE TO
MAKE THE XINDI UNDERSTAND

9
00:00:14,389 --> 00:00:16,183
THAT HUMANITY ISN'T THE ENEMY.

10
00:00:16,224 --> 00:00:18,268
THE WEAPON WON'T BE LAUNCHED
FOR SEVERAL DAYS.

11
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:20,312
SHOW US YOUR PROOF.

12
00:00:20,354 --> 00:00:23,732
YOU'RE SAYING THE EXPANSE WILL
NO LONGER BE COMPATIBLE FOR US.

13
00:00:23,774 --> 00:00:25,400
FOR ANY OF US.

14
00:00:25,442 --> 00:00:27,862
WE'RE DESTINED TO FORM
AN ALLIANCE TO STOP THEM.

15
00:00:27,903 --> 00:00:29,237
YOU NEED TO
SPEAK TO THE COUNCIL.

16
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:30,906
WITH THE EVIDENCE
YOU'VE SHOWN ME,

17
00:00:30,948 --> 00:00:34,075
THEY'LL HAVE NO CHOICE
BUT TO TAKE US SERIOUSLY.

18
00:00:34,117 --> 00:00:35,577
IF IT WEREN'T FOR MY ASSISTANCE,

19
00:00:35,619 --> 00:00:39,373
YOUR SPECIES WOULD BE
FACING DESTRUCTION.

20
00:00:39,414 --> 00:00:41,792
IS IT TRUE YOUR SPECIES
BUILT THE SPHERES?

21
00:00:41,834 --> 00:00:43,126
WHERE IS DEGRA?

22
00:00:43,502 --> 00:00:44,962
WHAT KIND OF WEAPONS
DO YOU HAVE?

23
00:00:45,004 --> 00:00:48,007
YOU EXPECT ME TO ATTACK
A REPTILIAN WARSHIP?

24
00:00:50,467 --> 00:00:52,260
THE REPTILIAN VESSEL'S
BEEN DESTROYED.

25
00:00:52,302 --> 00:00:54,262
<i>THEY WOULD HAVE CONTACTED</i>
<i>THE COUNCIL</i>

26
00:00:54,304 --> 00:00:56,473
<i>AND EXPOSED OUR ALLIANCE.</i>

27
00:00:56,515 --> 00:00:59,434
HE'LL BE KILLED THE MOMENT
HE STEPS INTO THE COUNCIL
CHAMBER.

28
00:00:59,476 --> 00:01:01,896
IF ARCHER<i> IS</i> TELLING THE TRUTH,

29
00:01:01,937 --> 00:01:06,191
THEN ALL THE COUNCIL'S EFFORTS
WILL BE FOR NOTHING.

30
00:01:08,235 --> 00:01:09,653
WE'VE BEEN SUCCESSFUL.

31
00:01:09,695 --> 00:01:12,489
THE XINDI WEAPON IS
DAYS AWAY FROM COMPLETION.

32
00:01:12,531 --> 00:01:15,242
THE TIMELINES DON'T SUPPORT
THAT ASSESSMENT.

33
00:01:15,283 --> 00:01:16,785
WHAT HAVE YOU SEEN?

34
00:01:16,827 --> 00:01:19,079
THE NUMBER OF LINES
WITH FAVORABLE OUTCOMES

35
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:20,622
HAS DIMINISHED.

36
00:01:20,664 --> 00:01:23,124
THERE IS NOW AN INCREASED CHANCE
THAT THE EARTH SHIP

37
00:01:23,166 --> 00:01:25,961
WILL PREVENT THE WEAPON
FROM BEING LAUNCHED.

38
00:01:26,003 --> 00:01:27,588
NOT NECESSARILY.

39
00:01:27,629 --> 00:01:29,172
TIMELINES ARE SENSITIVE.

40
00:01:29,214 --> 00:01:31,550
THEY'RE PRONE TO
TEMPORARY FLUCTUATIONS.

41
00:01:31,592 --> 00:01:33,218
THIS IS NO FLUCTUATION.

42
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:36,179
THIS IS A TRAJECTORY AWAY
FROM OUR DESIRED OUTCOME.

43
00:01:36,221 --> 00:01:39,098
SEE THAT YOU TAKE DEFINITIVE
ACTIONS
TO CORRECT THIS.

44
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:40,684
THE WEAPON MUST BE LAUNCHED.

45
00:01:40,726 --> 00:01:43,020
EARTH MUST BE DESTROYED.

HOW ARE YOU FEELING?

68
00:03:17,364 --> 00:03:21,160
THE EMOTIONS ARE STILL
DIFFICULT TO CONTROL.

69
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,703
MEDITATION ISN'T HELPING?

70
00:03:22,744 --> 00:03:25,372
SOMEWHAT, BUT I'M STILL
EXPERIENCING FREQUENT --

71
00:03:27,166 --> 00:03:28,667
YOU OKAY?

72
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:30,669
JUST A MILD HEADACHE.

73
00:03:30,711 --> 00:03:33,172
I THOUGHT VULCANS
DIDN'T GET HEADACHES.

74
00:03:34,882 --> 00:03:36,591
I'M NEEDED
IN THE COMMAND CENTER.

75
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:42,305
YOU NOTICE ANYTHING STRANGE
ABOUT THE WAY SHE'S BEEN ACTING?

76
00:03:43,098 --> 00:03:44,558
THERE ISN'T ANYONE ON THE SHIP

77
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:47,310
WHO HASN'T BEEN AFFECTED
BY RECENT EVENTS.

78
00:03:47,853 --> 00:03:49,104
WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU?

79
00:03:49,146 --> 00:03:51,314
I THINK I PULLED A MUSCLE.

80
00:03:52,399 --> 00:03:53,692
PAIN'S PRETTY BAD.

81
00:03:53,734 --> 00:03:55,027
HAVE A SEAT.

82
00:03:56,195 --> 00:03:58,072
WE'VE BEEN RUNNING DOUBLE SHIFTS
IN ENGINEERING.

83
00:03:58,113 --> 00:04:00,991
CAPTAIN'S IN A HELL OF A RUSH
TO GET TO THIS DAMN COUNCIL.

84
00:04:01,867 --> 00:04:03,243
HE BELIEVES HE CAN GET THE XINDI

85
00:04:03,284 --> 00:04:05,037
TO RECONSIDER
THEIR ATTACK ON EARTH.

86
00:04:05,079 --> 00:04:07,039
WE OWE HIM A LITTLE FAITH.

87
00:04:07,081 --> 00:04:09,332
OH, I HAVE FAITH IN THE CAPTAIN,

88
00:04:09,374 --> 00:04:11,168
BUT NOT IN THE PEOPLE
HE'S TRYING TO CONVINCE.

89
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:13,587
DEGRA SEEMS TO BE
A REASONABLE MAN.

90
00:04:13,628 --> 00:04:15,172
REASONABLE?

91
00:04:15,214 --> 00:04:17,340
I DON'T THINK MANY PEOPLE
BACK IN MY HOMETOWN

92
00:04:17,382 --> 00:04:18,633
WOULD GO ALONG WITH THAT.

93
00:04:24,598 --> 00:04:25,807
THANKS, DOC.

94
00:04:30,854 --> 00:04:32,189
THE SPHERES ARE CONTROLLED

95
00:04:32,231 --> 00:04:35,400
BY A NETWORK
OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE.

96
00:04:35,442 --> 00:04:38,486
THIS SECTION HOUSES
THE REDUNDANT MEMORY CORE.

97
00:04:38,528 --> 00:04:41,364
IT SHOULD CONTAIN A SIGNIFICANT
AMOUNT OF INFORMATION.

98
00:04:41,406 --> 00:04:44,284
WE'RE HOPING THAT'LL INCLUDE
DATA ON THE SPHERE BUILDERS.

99
00:04:44,325 --> 00:04:46,954
THAT COULD HELP US
WITH THE COUNCIL.

100
00:04:46,995 --> 00:04:50,290
OUR PRESENT COURSE WILL TAKE US
CLOSE TO ANOTHER SPHERE.

101
00:04:50,331 --> 00:04:52,167
I'M SENDING A CREW
IN A SHUTTLEPOD.

102
00:04:52,209 --> 00:04:53,961
THEY'LL JOIN UP WITH US LATER.

103
00:04:54,002 --> 00:04:57,047
HOW DO YOU PLAN
TO GET INSIDE IT?

104
00:04:57,089 --> 00:04:59,591
WE'RE PRETTY SURE
WE'VE FOUND A WAY IN.

105
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:02,552
YOU'VE MENTIONED
THE XINDI HAVE BEEN

106
00:05:02,594 --> 00:05:05,346
STUDYING THE SPHERES
FOR DECADES.

107
00:05:05,806 --> 00:05:07,641
WE'RE INTERESTED
IN ANY INFORMATION

108
00:05:07,682 --> 00:05:10,185
YOU HAVE ON THE CONSTRUCTION
OF THEIR OUTER SHELLS.

109
00:05:10,227 --> 00:05:13,272
I'LL SEND OVER WHATEVER'S
IN MY DATABASE.

110
00:05:14,689 --> 00:05:15,941
SIR.

111
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:20,320
I'VE BEEN REVIEWING
SERVICE TRANSCRIPTS.

112
00:05:20,361 --> 00:05:23,073
YOU'VE GOT OVER 1,000 HOURS
IN AN E.V. SUIT.

113
00:05:23,115 --> 00:05:25,533
I DID SIX MONTHS
ON THE JANUS LOOP.

114
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:27,869
YOU INTERESTED IN RUNNING
THIS MISSION WITH US?

115
00:05:27,911 --> 00:05:30,247
I'M ALWAYS READY
TO STRETCH MY LEGS, SIR.

116
00:05:30,289 --> 00:05:32,457
GET PREPPED.

117
00:05:32,499 --> 00:05:36,544
THE JANUS, THAT INCLUDES
E.V. COMBAT TRAINING?

118
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:37,712
YES, SIR.

119
00:05:37,754 --> 00:05:40,048
ARE WE EXPECTING A FIREFIGHT?

120
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:42,884
DON'T KNOW WHAT TO EXPECT.

121
00:05:52,311 --> 00:05:56,106
WHEN IT'S FINISHED COMPILING,
SEND IT TO<i> ENTERPRISE.</i>

122
00:05:56,148 --> 00:05:58,692
IT'S NOT TOO LATE.

123
00:06:04,531 --> 00:06:05,949
DISMISSED.

124
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:09,703
DISMISSED!

125
00:06:19,504 --> 00:06:22,799
NOT EVERYONE HAS FORGOTTEN
WHAT WE'VE DONE FOR YOUR PEOPLE.

126
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:24,968
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

127
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:27,721
YOU'VE TURNED AWAY FROM US.

128
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:31,308
COME BACK.

129
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:32,976
I CAN'T.

130
00:06:33,018 --> 00:06:34,686
I HEAR IT IN YOUR VOICE.

131
00:06:34,728 --> 00:06:37,105
YOU'VE BETRAYED
EVERYTHING YOU BELIEVE IN,

132
00:06:37,147 --> 00:06:39,191
AND NOW YOU'RE IN TURMOIL.

133
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,902
I DON'T REGRET WHAT I'M DOING.

134
00:06:41,943 --> 00:06:44,363
AT ONE TIME OR ANOTHER,
YOU MUST HAVE ASKED YOURSELF

135
00:06:44,403 --> 00:06:48,283
WHY WE'VE PROTECTED THE XINDI
FOR SO LONG.

136
00:06:48,325 --> 00:06:50,702
MANY OF US HAVE WONDERED THAT.

137
00:06:50,744 --> 00:06:53,454
IT'S BECAUSE WE CAN SEE A FUTURE

138
00:06:53,496 --> 00:06:55,916
WHERE THE XINDI
ARE NO LONGER FRAGMENTED,

139
00:06:55,957 --> 00:07:00,128
NO LONGER
STRUGGLING FOR EXISTENCE.

140
00:07:01,504 --> 00:07:07,052
YOU ARE DESTINED TO BECOME
A GREAT CIVILIZATION.

141
00:07:07,802 --> 00:07:11,348
AND NOW IT'S ALL IN JEOPARDY...

142
00:07:12,099 --> 00:07:14,017
BECAUSE OF YOU.

143
00:07:15,227 --> 00:07:16,937
NO.

144
00:07:16,978 --> 00:07:20,274
YOU CREATED A DEVICE THAT WILL
PREVENT A DEVASTATING ATTACK.

145
00:07:20,315 --> 00:07:23,902
YOUR NAME WAS TO BE SPOKEN
WITH REVERENCE

146
00:07:23,944 --> 00:07:26,571
FOR GENERATIONS TO COME.

147
00:07:27,822 --> 00:07:33,453
AND INSTEAD, YOU'VE CHOSEN
THE ROLE OF BETRAYER.

148
00:07:34,246 --> 00:07:37,958
HOW I'M REMEMBERED
ISN'T FOR YOU TO DECIDE.

149
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:42,754
WHAT HAVE WE DONE
TO LOSE YOUR FAITH?

150
00:07:44,423 --> 00:07:48,427
YOU NEVER DESERVED MY FAITH.

151
00:07:55,642 --> 00:07:58,186
THE SPHERE BUILDERS
HAVE LIED TO THE XINDI.

152
00:07:58,228 --> 00:08:00,355
THEY'VE MANIPULATED US
FOR DECADES.

153
00:08:00,397 --> 00:08:01,898
I SEE THAT.

154
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:04,401
PERHAPS THE ARBOREALS WILL,
BUT THE OTHERS...

155
00:08:04,443 --> 00:08:07,487
WE HAVE THE EVIDENCE
TO BACK IT UP.

156
00:08:07,528 --> 00:08:09,948
THE EVIDENCE MAY NOT BE ENOUGH.

157
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:15,662
THE SPHERE BUILDERS SAVED
THE XINDI FROM EXTINCTION.

158
00:08:15,703 --> 00:08:17,956
WHEN OUR HOMEWORLD
WAS DESTROYED,

159
00:08:18,748 --> 00:08:20,292
THEY BEGAN APPEARING
TO THE SURVIVORS.

160
00:08:20,334 --> 00:08:22,461
THEY'D GUIDE THEM
TO HABITABLE PLANETS,

161
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:25,546
SHOW THEM THE LOCATION
OF VALUABLE RESOURCES.

162
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:27,299
THEY'RE PRACTICALLY WORSHIPED.

163
00:08:27,799 --> 00:08:30,844
WE CALL THEM "THE GUARDIANS."

164
00:08:30,885 --> 00:08:33,472
IT'S NO WONDER YOU HAD
A HARD TIME ACCEPTING THIS.

165
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:36,891
I WAS BROUGHT UP TO REVERE THEM.

166
00:08:36,933 --> 00:08:39,811
I TAUGHT MY OWN CHILDREN
TO GIVE THANKS TO THEM

167
00:08:39,853 --> 00:08:41,480
AT THE END OF EACH DAY.

168
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:44,399
THAT IS WHAT WE'RE FACING.

169
00:08:44,441 --> 00:08:47,861
I'VE STOOD BEFORE
A KLINGON TRIBUNAL.

170
00:08:47,902 --> 00:08:49,696
I CAN HANDLE A TOUGH ROOM.

171
00:08:49,737 --> 00:08:53,283
KLINGONS WEREN'T DETERMINED
TO DESTROY YOUR WORLD.

172
00:08:53,325 --> 00:08:55,410
BUT THE EVIDENCE IS STRONG.

173
