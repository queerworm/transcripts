00:42:31,924 --> 00:42:35,470
TO THE HIGH COMMAND
ABOUT THAT TRANSFER ORDER.

690
00:42:35,512 --> 00:42:37,430
I'D SAY THE ODDS ARE PRETTY GOOD

691
00:42:37,472 --> 00:42:40,141
YOU'RE GOING TO BE WITH US
FOR A WHILE LONGER.

692
00:42:42,435 --> 00:42:45,271
YOU SHOULD HAVE
CONSULTED ME FIRST.

693
00:42:46,689 --> 00:42:48,607
[ SIGHS ]

694
00:42:48,649 --> 00:42:52,904
IT'S PROBABLY NOT TOO LATE
IF YOU WANT TO CATCH UP TO HIM.

695
00:42:58,451 --> 00:43:01,162
THAT WON'T BE POSSIBLE.

696
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:06,709
LEAVING SICK BAY WOULD VIOLATE
MY DOCTOR'S ORDERS.
