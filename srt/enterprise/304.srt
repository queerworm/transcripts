1
00:00:01,710 --> 00:00:03,586
How much of the lab was destroyed?

2
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:04,879
Nearly all of it.

3
00:00:05,505 --> 00:00:08,591
Three of my researchers were killed.

4
00:00:08,675 --> 00:00:10,677
And what of your work, Degra?

5
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:13,555
I haven't been able to assess
how much data was lost.

6
00:00:13,638 --> 00:00:15,640
This will obviously delay us.

7
00:00:15,724 --> 00:00:17,350
{\an8}( clicking )

8
00:00:17,434 --> 00:00:19,269
{\an8}Months, perhaps. I'm not certain.

9
00:00:19,352 --> 00:00:22,856
{\an8}( clicking )

10
00:00:22,939 --> 00:00:26,484
They attacked a trellium mine.
We cannot wait any longer.

11
00:00:26,568 --> 00:00:29,863
Think what you're asking me to do!

12
00:00:30,363 --> 00:00:34,826
Build a weapon to destroy an entire world.

13
00:00:34,909 --> 00:00:39,539
Do you understand how difficult,
how dangerous, this project is?

14
00:00:39,622 --> 00:00:43,126
Are you saying you're not up to the task?

15
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:48,173
{\an8}( screeching )

16
00:00:51,301 --> 00:00:55,680
I agree. We are too far along
to change our plan.

17
00:00:55,764 --> 00:00:57,932
Besides, we have no alternative.

18
00:00:58,016 --> 00:01:00,727
You know that isn't true.

19
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:03,605
That option has been
discussed and rejected.

20
00:01:03,688 --> 00:01:05,106
{\an8}( clicking )

21
00:01:05,523 --> 00:01:09,778
{\an8}Perhaps it is time to reconsider
our colleagues' proposal.

22
00:01:09,861 --> 00:01:12,572
We do not have enough information
about the humans.

23
00:01:12,655 --> 00:01:14,824
That can be remedied.

24
00:01:15,158 --> 00:01:17,202
{\an8}( screeching )

25
00:01:17,952 --> 00:01:19,162
I agree.

26
00:01:19,245 --> 00:01:20,205
( scoffs )

27
00:01:20,288 --> 00:01:22,540
Degra deserves more time.

28
00:01:23,374 --> 00:01:25,126
{\an8}( screeching )

29
00:03:00,305 --> 00:03:03,099
Is that sufficient pressure?

30
00:03:03,182 --> 00:03:05,184
You could go a little harder.

31
00:03:07,478 --> 00:03:10,106
{\an8}Mmm, perfect.

32
00:03:15,194 --> 00:03:17,447
{\an8}Try that neck thing. What do you call it?

33
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:19,991
{\an8}-The Khavorta posture?
-Yeah. That one.

34
00:03:20,074 --> 00:03:21,492
{\an8}Are you certain?

35
00:03:21,576 --> 00:03:24,120
{\an8}Don't worry.
I've been practicing my breathing.

36
00:03:25,663 --> 00:03:28,124
{\an8}( inhaling deeply )

37
00:03:31,252 --> 00:03:33,463
{\an8}You have been practicing.

38
00:03:37,342 --> 00:03:38,468
{\an8}T'Pol...

39
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:40,053
{\an8}Don't speak.

40
00:03:41,262 --> 00:03:43,014
{\an8}Relax your jaw.

41
00:03:45,266 --> 00:03:46,768
{\an8}Excellent.

42
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:51,731
{\an8}Now the Surah'than.

43
00:03:52,774 --> 00:03:55,610
{\an8}You know, I really need
to talk to you about something.

44
00:03:56,611 --> 00:03:58,071
{\an8}Is there a problem?

45
00:03:58,154 --> 00:04:00,949
{\an8}No. No, no. I mean, this feels great

46
00:04:01,032 --> 00:04:02,617
{\an8}And I really appreciate you
taking the time.

47
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:04,327
{\an8}It's just...

48
00:04:05,536 --> 00:04:08,373
{\an8}I'm not sure we should be
doin' it anymore.

49
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:10,708
{\an8}You said this was helping you sleep.

50
00:04:10,792 --> 00:04:11,876
{\an8}It has.

51
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:14,963
{\an8}Then why do you want to stop?

52
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:16,798
{\an8}People are talking.

53
00:04:17,382 --> 00:04:18,591
About us.

54
00:04:18,675 --> 00:04:21,386
About me coming to your quarters at night.

55
00:04:22,887 --> 00:04:25,807
They think there's more going on
than neuro-pressure.

56
00:04:28,351 --> 00:04:29,894
And that disturbs you?

57
00:04:29,978 --> 00:04:32,397
It shouldn't, I know, but...

58
00:04:33,856 --> 00:04:37,068
Malcolm and I were purging
a clogged injector assembly last week,

59
00:04:37,151 --> 00:04:38,736
and he asked me why

60
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:41,155
I didn't just massage it
with my magic fingers.

61
00:04:42,323 --> 00:04:45,201
I see no reason to be
concerned with idle gossip.

62
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:46,911
It doesn't bother you?

63
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:49,122
We're both senior officers.

64
00:04:49,205 --> 00:04:51,457
If we were pursuing
a romantic relationship,

65
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:54,585
it wouldn't be Lieutenant Reed's concern,
would it?

66
00:04:56,671 --> 00:04:58,006
I suppose not.

67
00:04:58,339 --> 00:04:59,966
Shall we continue?

68
00:05:00,049 --> 00:05:01,301
( chuckles )

69
00:05:08,766 --> 00:05:11,728
( Archer murmuring )

70
00:05:22,071 --> 00:05:24,449
( grunting )

71
00:05:28,745 --> 00:05:30,538
( sighing )

72
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,341
( sighing )

73
00:05:51,934 --> 00:05:53,394
PHLOX: <i>You've been scratching again.</i>

74
00:05:53,978 --> 00:05:57,190
The itching kept me up all night.

75
00:05:57,273 --> 00:05:59,233
Have you been using the ointment
I gave you?

76
00:05:59,317 --> 00:06:03,571
I tried, but the smell is...
is a little strong.

77
00:06:03,654 --> 00:06:06,949
The more you scratch,
the longer it will take to heal.

78
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:14,082
I understand you may have
found a source of trellium-D?

79
00:06:14,165 --> 00:06:16,542
A V'radian chemist we met
at the deuterium station

80
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:19,378
claims he knows a way to synthesize it.

81
00:06:19,462 --> 00:06:20,963
I hope he's correct.

82
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:22,381
Crewman Cutler broke her arm

83
00:06:22,465 --> 00:06:26,761
when one of those spatial anomalies
went through the exobiology lab.

84
00:06:26,844 --> 00:06:28,805
The sooner the ship is insulated
against these phenomena,

85
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:30,473
the happier I will be.

86
00:06:30,556 --> 00:06:33,601
-We're working on it, Doctor.
-Of course.

87
00:06:39,148 --> 00:06:41,484
Have you, uh, had any other symptoms?

88
00:06:42,318 --> 00:06:43,945
Just, um...

89
00:06:44,028 --> 00:06:45,279
( groaning )

90
00:06:45,363 --> 00:06:46,656
Dreams.

91
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:50,368
I keep...

92
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:55,873
seeing myself back at that alien city.

93
00:06:58,084 --> 00:07:01,045
You were transformed
into a different species.

94
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:03,214
Don't expect to recover overnight.

95
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:35,705
( indistinct talking )

96
00:07:45,882 --> 00:07:48,676
The chemist said his shop
is on barge 12.

97
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:56,017
( creatures squawking )

98
00:08:09,864 --> 00:08:12,200
Phlox would have a field day here.

99
00:08:12,283 --> 00:08:15,536
I'm afraid we'll have to save
the souvenir hunting for another time.

100
00:08:21,292 --> 00:08:23,920
I don't recognize your species.
You must be newcomers.

101
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:25,546
-Welcome.
-Thank you.

102
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:28,549
We're looking for barge 12,
a chemist named B'Rat Ud.

103
00:08:28,633 --> 00:08:30,843
It would be a shame
if I let you leave our world

104
00:08:30,927 --> 00:08:33,596
without introducing you
to the local wildlife.

105
00:08:34,096 --> 00:08:35,640
T-that's not necessary.

106
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:38,476
Xanthan marmots make wonderful pets

107
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:41,604
and their flesh is quite succulent
when prepared properly.

108
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:43,272
No, thank you.

109
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:47,068
Can you dire-- direct us to the chemist?

110
00:08:48,319 --> 00:08:50,947
Barge 12 is that way. Tier 2.

111
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:53,449
( Xanthan marmot chirping )

112
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:03,042
( door opens )

113
00:09:04,669 --> 00:09:06,212
I'm closed.

114
00:09:07,505 --> 00:09:08,756
I have an appointment.

115
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:14,929
We met at the deuterium station
on Norellus.

116
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:17,598
You'll have to come back later.

117
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:22,228
You said you could sell us the formula
to synthesize trellium-D.

118
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:25,815
I hope you didn't bring us
all this way for nothing.

119
00:09:26,482 --> 00:09:29,610
Captain Archer. I remember now.

120
00:09:29,694 --> 00:09:30,945
How are you?

121
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:34,031
-A little pressed for time.
-Of course.

122
00:09:35,449 --> 00:09:40,329
Trellium-A is extremely common,
easy to synthesize,

123
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:45,751
but trellium-D is rare,
difficult to process.

124
00:09:45,835 --> 00:09:47,211
And expensive?

125
00:09:48,129 --> 00:09:51,799
I'm confident we can agree
on a fair price.

126
00:09:52,633 --> 00:09:54,760
I was thinking about you recently,
Captain.

127
00:09:54,844 --> 00:09:58,347
You were very eager to learn
about the Xindi, as I recall.

128
00:09:58,431 --> 00:10:01,225
What is your interest in them?

129
00:10:02,351 --> 00:10:04,312
We're on a diplomatic mission.

130
00:10:04,395 --> 00:10:06,689
A diplomatic mission.

131
00:10:06,772 --> 00:10:08,024
( chuckles )

132
00:10:08,107 --> 00:10:11,068
Some Xindi arrived here last week.

133
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:13,863
I thought you might be interested.

134
00:10:13,946 --> 00:10:15,281
Where can we find them?

135
00:10:15,364 --> 00:10:17,658
They had business with another merchant.

136
00:10:17,742 --> 00:10:19,076
Who?

137
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:22,997
I'd be happy to direct you
for a small fee.

138
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:28,711
Commander Tucker has the list
of supplies and equipment

139
00:10:28,794 --> 00:10:30,087
we'd be willing to barter.

140
00:10:30,171 --> 00:10:31,922
As a gesture of good faith,

141
00:10:32,006 --> 00:10:34,216
why don't you tell me where
we can find this merchant,

142
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:38,220
then you and Mr. Tucker
can work out the details.

143
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:42,725
I'm confident we can agree
on a fair price.

144
00:10:42,808 --> 00:10:45,019
( aliens chattering )

145
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:50,399
FEMALE: Do you like what you see?

146
00:11:01,243 --> 00:11:07,708
To answer your first question,
I regret I cannot offer free samples.

147
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:10,294
B'Rat Ud said
you might be able to help us.

148
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:12,797
I always welcome referrals.

149
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,548
What is your pleasure?

150
00:11:14,632 --> 00:11:17,676
We were told you've recently
done business with some Xindi.

151
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,470
Excellent customers.

152
00:11:20,137 --> 00:11:23,099
They purchased two U'tani serpent women.

153
00:11:23,557 --> 00:11:25,101
I'm afraid I don't have any more,

154
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:29,772
but perhaps I could interest you
in a nuvian concubine.

155
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:33,526
She's quite skilled.

156
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:36,570
We're not interested.

157
00:11:37,405 --> 00:11:40,032
I want to know
where I can find these Xindi.

158
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:43,411
I believe they left orbit two days ago.

159
00:11:44,745 --> 00:11:46,247
Where were they heading?

160
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:48,582
I wouldn't stay in business for very long

161
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:51,752
if I revealed
confidential information about my clients.

162
00:11:52,503 --> 00:11:55,631
But I have females here from many worlds.

163
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:57,758
Who knows?

164
00:11:58,551 --> 00:12:03,264
Perhaps one of them can tell you
what you want to know about the Xindi.

165
00:12:26,454 --> 00:12:29,248
You have an excellent eye, my friend.

166
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:33,878
She can be very accommodating.

167
00:12:36,922 --> 00:12:38,841
( communicator beeps )

168
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:42,136
Archer.

169
00:12:42,219 --> 00:12:44,430
TUCKER: <i>Captain, B'Rat and I</i>
<i>have agreed on a price.</i>

170
00:12:44,513 --> 00:12:46,682
<i>I'll need to go back</i>
<i>to the ship for his payment.</i>

171
00:12:46,765 --> 00:12:49,185
Understood. We'll meet you
back at the shuttlepod.

172
00:12:50,769 --> 00:12:53,272
How can you walk away from such beauty?

173
00:12:58,319 --> 00:12:59,737
Thanks for your time.

174
00:13:06,702 --> 00:13:10,080
After an hour in this place,
I can't wait to get back to decon.

175
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:15,920
-( crashing )
-MALE: Stop her!

176
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:24,762
MALE 2: Watch yourself!

177
00:13:27,306 --> 00:13:29,099
Take me with you, please!

178
00:13:29,183 --> 00:13:30,851
( panting )

179
00:13:30,935 --> 00:13:32,811
She seems determined to be sold today.

180
00:13:33,395 --> 00:13:35,689
Let's go back to my shop
and arrange for payment.

181
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:38,484
I don't think so.

182
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:40,945
Then I'll take my merchandise.

183
00:13:41,028 --> 00:13:43,113
Looks like she doesn't want
to go with you.

184
00:13:43,697 --> 00:13:46,700
If you're so concerned
about what she wants, buy her.

185
00:13:46,784 --> 00:13:49,286
Otherwise, stay out of my business!

186
00:13:57,169 --> 00:13:59,255
( grunting )

187
00:14:24,196 --> 00:14:27,324
-Let's get out of here.
-Gladly.

188
00:14:40,504 --> 00:14:42,464
You have the most intriguing eyes.

189
00:14:44,091 --> 00:14:46,927
I've never seen a retinal structure
this complex.

190
00:14:47,011 --> 00:14:48,637
( door opens )

191
00:14:51,932 --> 00:14:53,434
How's our guest?

192
00:14:53,517 --> 00:14:55,311
I'm not familiar with her species

193
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:58,606
but, uh, she appears to be
in perfect health.

194
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:07,948
I'm afraid I don't even know your name.

195
00:15:09,825 --> 00:15:11,535
I'm called Rajiin.

196
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,581
Very grateful for what
you've done, Captain.

197
00:15:15,664 --> 00:15:17,875
I'll serve you well, I promise.

198
00:15:20,669 --> 00:15:22,630
Let's get something straight.

199
00:15:24,298 --> 00:15:27,968
We don't believe one person
can own another person.

200
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:30,346
You're free to go wherever you'd like.

201
00:15:32,389 --> 00:15:34,808
How far is your homeworld?

202
00:15:34,892 --> 00:15:36,226
I don't know.

203
00:15:36,852 --> 00:15:38,646
I'm told it's called Oran'taku,

204
00:15:38,729 --> 00:15:41,231
but I don't remember it.

205
00:15:42,691 --> 00:15:45,694
-Do you have any family?
-I've had many owners.

206
00:15:49,031 --> 00:15:52,117
We have some data on this region of space.

207
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:56,121
I'll see if I can locate Oran'taku.

208
00:15:56,622 --> 00:15:58,874
If it's possible, we'll take you there.

209
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:01,293
Set her up in quarters.
Get her whatever she needs.

210
00:16:01,377 --> 00:16:02,294
Of course.

211
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:03,545
Captain.

212
00:16:05,673 --> 00:16:06,674
Thank you.

213
00:16:13,722 --> 00:16:15,391
On our planet,

214
00:16:16,767 --> 00:16:19,311
wars were fought over these.

215
00:16:19,395 --> 00:16:21,063
Mmm.

216
00:16:21,146 --> 00:16:23,148
( chuckling )

217
00:16:27,403 --> 00:16:29,822
Careful.

218
00:16:29,905 --> 00:16:32,741
( snorting )

219
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:35,244
( sneezes )

220
00:16:36,453 --> 00:16:38,330
( laughing )

221
00:16:38,414 --> 00:16:39,832
What's this one called?

222
00:16:39,915 --> 00:16:41,667
-Black pepper.
-Ooh!

223
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:44,128
There's paprika, mustard seed.

224
00:16:44,211 --> 00:16:46,046
I'm partial to the cayenne myself.

225
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:49,466
I'm sure you'll find these all
very exotic.

226
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:51,510
I believe you have something for us?

227
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:53,595
Of course.

228
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:59,268
I've reviewed
your engineering specifications.

229
00:16:59,351 --> 00:17:04,231
You appear to have the necessary equipment
to produce liquid trellium-D.

230
00:17:04,314 --> 00:17:05,441
Liquid?

231
00:17:05,524 --> 00:17:09,695
Trellium can only be synthesized
in a liquid state.

232
00:17:09,778 --> 00:17:13,157
It's just as effective as the natural ore.

233
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:15,075
Then all we need is the recipe.

234
00:17:15,159 --> 00:17:17,286
Uh, there is one thing.

235
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:22,583
Be sure to follow the protocols precisely.

236
00:17:23,792 --> 00:17:25,002
Or?

237
00:17:25,085 --> 00:17:28,839
Let's just say that in its liquid form,

238
00:17:28,922 --> 00:17:33,510
trellium-D is extremely unstable.

239
00:17:40,517 --> 00:17:43,228
( Zjod snorting, sneezing )

240
00:17:43,312 --> 00:17:45,147
( laughing )

241
00:17:46,273 --> 00:17:47,566
Ooh!

242
00:17:57,284 --> 00:17:59,453
How are your accommodations?

243
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:02,456
Much better than I'm used to.

244
00:18:03,373 --> 00:18:06,460
The last ship I was on,
I never left the cargo hold.

245
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:10,130
Except for a few visits
to the captain's quarters.

246
00:18:14,301 --> 00:18:17,721
There are some restricted areas
on <i>Enterprise.</i>

247
00:18:18,263 --> 00:18:20,432
Otherwise, feel free to look around.

248
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,476
Your crew won't mind?

249
00:18:24,728 --> 00:18:26,146
I seriously doubt it.

250
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:32,027
-Are they all from Earth?
-Nearly all.

251
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:34,571
You met Dr. Phlox. He's from Denobula.

252
00:18:34,655 --> 00:18:36,698
And my First Officer's a Vulcan.

253
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:42,412
Dr. Phlox mentioned you were
on an important mission.

254
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:46,041
We're trying to make contact
with a species called Xindi.

255
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:48,752
I don't suppose you know
anything about them?

256
00:18:48,836 --> 00:18:50,295
Very little.

257
00:18:51,004 --> 00:18:55,843
The two I saw looked reptilian,
and they weren't very pleasant.

258
00:18:55,926 --> 00:18:59,012
At the time, I was just relieved
they weren't interested in me.

259
00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:01,849
Why are you looking for them?

260
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:05,227
We're hoping to resolve a disagreement.

261
00:19:05,769 --> 00:19:08,147
-( intercom beeps )
<i>-Tucker to Captain Archer.</i>

262
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:10,566
Archer.

263
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:12,192
<i>We're in business, sir.</i>

264
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:14,194
I'll be right there.

265
00:19:15,904 --> 00:19:16,989
Excuse me.

266
00:19:19,074 --> 00:19:20,742
( door closing )

267
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:22,578
ARCHER: How unstable?

268
00:19:23,036 --> 00:19:25,789
Enough to do some serious damage
if we screw this up.

269
00:19:25,873 --> 00:19:28,500
And we're supposed to insulate
the entire ship with it?

270
00:19:28,584 --> 00:19:30,335
It's only volatile in its liquid form.

271
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:34,006
Once we apply it to the inner hull
and it sets, it's completely safe.

272
00:19:34,089 --> 00:19:36,550
The tricky part's cookin' it up
in the first place.

273
00:19:36,633 --> 00:19:38,802
It'll require extremely precise
calculations,

274
00:19:38,886 --> 00:19:42,097
But I believe Mr. Tucker and I
can synthesize the compound safely.

275
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:44,057
Get started.

276
00:19:44,141 --> 00:19:46,059
I recommend we set up
a lab on E-deck

277
00:19:46,143 --> 00:19:49,479
within the emergency bulkheads,
as a precaution.

278
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:58,822
( sighing )

279
00:19:59,489 --> 00:20:01,116
( door chimes )

280
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,951
Come in.

281
00:20:14,504 --> 00:20:16,256
Good evening, Captain.

282
00:20:16,548 --> 00:20:17,758
Is everything all right?

283
00:20:17,841 --> 00:20:19,509
I'm sorry to disturb you.

284
00:20:19,593 --> 00:20:21,803
I hoped you might have time to talk.

285
00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:24,181
Um...

286
00:20:24,264 --> 00:20:27,100
I'm, uh, not quite, uh...

287
00:20:28,477 --> 00:20:29,645
Please.

288
00:20:36,276 --> 00:20:38,070
I meant to speak with you earlier.

289
00:20:38,153 --> 00:20:40,030
We have some good news.

290
00:20:40,113 --> 00:20:44,201
T'Pol was able to locate your home planet
in a database we acquired.

291
00:20:44,284 --> 00:20:45,744
It's only two days away.

292
00:20:49,289 --> 00:20:51,250
You don't seem very pleased.

293
00:20:52,334 --> 00:20:55,837
I was taken away when I was very young.

294
00:20:55,921 --> 00:20:59,049
I don't remember much about it.

295
00:20:59,132 --> 00:21:01,385
And I doubt anyone there
would remember me.

296
00:21:03,428 --> 00:21:05,722
You never know.

297
00:21:05,806 --> 00:21:08,600
You seem very memorable to me.

298
00:21:11,019 --> 00:21:13,981
I'm very grateful for what you've done,
Captain.

299
00:21:16,024 --> 00:21:18,902
I want to repay you for your kindness.

300
00:21:19,319 --> 00:21:20,988
That isn't necessary.

301
00:21:21,071 --> 00:21:22,322
I know.

302
00:21:23,448 --> 00:21:24,658
Rajiin, you--

303
00:21:25,492 --> 00:21:28,620
There's a reason I was taken from my home.

304
00:21:29,496 --> 00:21:32,332
I have certain gifts.

305
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:35,669
Would you like me to show you?

306
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:42,259
That... really isn't something that--

307
00:21:46,346 --> 00:21:48,223
It's all right.

308
00:21:51,727 --> 00:21:54,438
( faint hissing )

309
00:22:22,716 --> 00:22:24,051
Captain.

310
00:22:25,052 --> 00:22:26,470
Is something wrong?

311
00:22:28,346 --> 00:22:29,431
No.

312
00:22:30,807 --> 00:22:33,852
Well, I just wanted to say
thank you again.

313
00:22:35,437 --> 00:22:37,481
We'll be leaving orbit soon.

314
00:22:39,149 --> 00:22:40,233
Good night.

315
00:22:40,317 --> 00:22:41,443
( door chimes )

316
00:22:41,526 --> 00:22:43,028
Good night.

317
00:22:54,706 --> 00:22:56,041
What's the molecular pressure?

318
00:22:56,124 --> 00:22:57,834
Up to 1,100 units.

319
00:22:57,918 --> 00:22:59,169
Boy, this stuff is tricky.

320
00:22:59,252 --> 00:23:00,837
( beeping )

321
00:23:00,921 --> 00:23:04,925
Decrease the theta bombardment
by 6%... No, 7%.

322
00:23:06,551 --> 00:23:09,346
The pressure's still rising, 1,400 units.

323
00:23:09,763 --> 00:23:11,431
1,430.

324
00:23:11,515 --> 00:23:13,600
Damn it! ( sighs )

325
00:23:13,683 --> 00:23:15,894
Kill the theta radiation altogether.

326
00:23:15,977 --> 00:23:17,270
( beeping continues )

327
00:23:18,647 --> 00:23:19,815
No effect.

328
00:23:20,398 --> 00:23:22,818
We should seal off this section and leave.

329
00:23:22,901 --> 00:23:25,403
A sustained burst of delta radiation
might do the trick.

330
00:23:25,487 --> 00:23:27,781
And it might not. We should evacuate.

331
00:23:27,864 --> 00:23:30,075
I'm going to ramp the delta to 80%.

332
00:23:32,744 --> 00:23:33,995
It's not working.

333
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:35,580
You're welcome to leave.

334
00:23:35,664 --> 00:23:37,290
The pressure is up to 2,000 units.

335
00:23:37,374 --> 00:23:39,376
-( warning alarm beeping )
-Commander!

336
00:23:50,303 --> 00:23:51,304
( coughs )

337
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:58,353
Some of our calculations
may have been slightly off.

338
00:23:58,895 --> 00:24:00,897
We're back to square one.

339
00:24:02,399 --> 00:24:03,692
( sighs )

340
00:24:04,025 --> 00:24:05,610
We've been working for six hours.

341
00:24:05,694 --> 00:24:07,070
I suggest we take a break.

342
00:24:07,821 --> 00:24:09,156
I can't argue with that.

343
00:24:09,239 --> 00:24:11,449
Come to my quarters in half an hour.

344
00:24:11,533 --> 00:24:13,493
We'll resume your neuro-pressure regimen.

345
00:24:13,577 --> 00:24:14,953
I'll be fine.

346
00:24:15,036 --> 00:24:17,664
I'd prefer you were rested
before we make another attempt.

347
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:43,106
Can I help you?

348
00:24:45,358 --> 00:24:47,861
The captain said it was all right
if I left my quarters.

349
00:24:47,944 --> 00:24:50,155
-I'm Rajiin.
-I know.

350
00:24:50,947 --> 00:24:52,824
News travels fast on a starship.

351
00:24:52,908 --> 00:24:54,534
I'm Ensign Hoshi Sato.

352
00:24:56,119 --> 00:24:57,370
It's a pleasure to meet you.

353
00:25:00,498 --> 00:25:03,585
I was looking for the mess hall.

354
00:25:04,753 --> 00:25:07,255
I just happen to be going that way.

355
00:25:12,427 --> 00:25:14,804
What's your job here?

356
00:25:14,888 --> 00:25:17,766
I'm the ship's communications officer.

357
00:25:17,849 --> 00:25:19,351
I see.

358
00:25:21,811 --> 00:25:23,939
I'd love to hear your language.

359
00:25:29,277 --> 00:25:32,197
Actually, I speak quite a few.

360
00:25:53,134 --> 00:25:54,469
You must be T'Pol.

361
00:26:03,979 --> 00:26:07,524
I didn't mean to startle you.
My name is Rajiin.

362
00:26:07,983 --> 00:26:09,359
I know who you are.

363
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:12,112
What are you doing here?

364
00:26:12,779 --> 00:26:14,406
Your door was unlocked.

365
00:26:15,407 --> 00:26:16,741
That's not likely.

366
00:26:17,534 --> 00:26:20,370
I was hoping we'd have a chance to talk.

367
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:24,082
Perhaps you are unfamiliar
with our protocols,

368
00:26:24,165 --> 00:26:28,336
but it is unacceptable
for you to be in my quarters uninvited.

369
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:30,839
I didn't think you'd mind.

370
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:34,551
-I'm afraid--
-You're a Vulcan.

371
00:26:34,634 --> 00:26:36,928
On a ship filled with humans.

372
00:26:37,012 --> 00:26:38,305
Why?

373
00:26:40,181 --> 00:26:42,600
Vulcans and humans are allies.

374
00:26:45,145 --> 00:26:46,688
Now please leave.

375
00:26:49,399 --> 00:26:52,068
-What are you doing?
-Don't resist.

376
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:55,905
I need you to leave.

377
00:26:58,033 --> 00:27:00,076
You have a disciplined mind.

378
00:27:00,577 --> 00:27:03,330
You're in such control of your emotions.

379
00:27:04,247 --> 00:27:05,665
( whispers ) Try to let go.

380
00:27:06,583 --> 00:27:08,501
( sighing deeply )

381
00:27:09,127 --> 00:27:10,295
Better.

382
00:27:16,926 --> 00:27:19,095
( breathes deeply )

383
00:27:26,686 --> 00:27:28,104
Stop.

384
00:27:28,938 --> 00:27:30,273
Let go.

385
00:27:37,655 --> 00:27:38,948
( door chimes )

386
00:27:45,205 --> 00:27:46,581
( chimes )

387
00:27:47,957 --> 00:27:49,125
( gasps )

388
00:27:49,209 --> 00:27:51,503
( grunts )

389
00:27:53,088 --> 00:27:55,840
( both grunting )

390
00:27:59,594 --> 00:28:01,054
No!

391
00:28:01,137 --> 00:28:02,680
-( door chimes )
-No!

392
00:28:03,932 --> 00:28:05,600
-( communicator beeps )
-Tucker to the bridge.

393
00:28:05,683 --> 00:28:06,810
FEMALE: <i>Go ahead.</i>

394
00:28:06,893 --> 00:28:09,187
Could you tell me where T'Pol is?

395
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:11,064
<i>She's in her quarters, sir.</i>

396
00:28:14,401 --> 00:28:16,277
( beeping )

397
00:28:25,662 --> 00:28:26,704
( grunts )

398
00:28:36,297 --> 00:28:39,008
-( communicator beeps )
-Tucker to Security.

399
00:28:41,136 --> 00:28:43,388
-I need assistance.
-MALE REPTILIAN: <i>Were you successful?</i>

400
00:28:43,471 --> 00:28:46,558
I have what you want.
I can use their transporter device,

401
00:28:46,641 --> 00:28:49,018
but you'll need to be
within 10,000 kilometers.

402
00:28:49,102 --> 00:28:50,854
MALE REPTILIAN: 
<i>Signal us when you're ready.</i>

403
00:28:55,316 --> 00:28:57,402
Is there something wrong?

404
00:28:57,485 --> 00:28:59,279
The captain would like to see you.

405
00:28:59,904 --> 00:29:03,158
There's no need to bother the captain.

406
00:29:03,825 --> 00:29:05,660
I have my orders.

407
00:29:05,744 --> 00:29:06,870
So do I.

408
00:29:06,953 --> 00:29:08,580
Shh.

409
00:29:41,654 --> 00:29:43,531
( sighs )

410
00:29:50,914 --> 00:29:52,123
( grunts )

411
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:25,573
Are you in range?

412
00:30:26,366 --> 00:30:27,742
Respond!

413
00:30:29,452 --> 00:30:31,663
Leaving so soon?

414
00:30:38,294 --> 00:30:40,046
We jammed your signal.

415
00:30:40,129 --> 00:30:41,923
Your friends can't hear you.

416
00:30:43,424 --> 00:30:45,093
Who are they?

417
00:30:54,269 --> 00:30:55,687
Take her to the brig.

418
00:31:02,193 --> 00:31:04,112
You should let me run a neuro-scan.

419
00:31:04,195 --> 00:31:05,989
I'll be fine.

420
00:31:06,072 --> 00:31:07,657
What happened to her?

421
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:09,701
I can't even begin to speculate.

422
00:31:09,784 --> 00:31:12,078
She's suffered disruptions
throughout her neocortex.

423
00:31:12,161 --> 00:31:14,455
If she were human,
or Denobulan for that matter,

424
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:15,832
she'd probably be dead.

425
00:31:15,915 --> 00:31:20,545
But Vulcan neurophysiology
is a great deal more resilient than ours.

426
00:31:20,628 --> 00:31:22,088
I want to talk to her.

427
00:31:22,171 --> 00:31:24,674
I have to finish
treating her injuries first.

428
00:31:24,757 --> 00:31:27,427
-How long?
-A few hours.

429
00:31:36,728 --> 00:31:38,938
Have Phlox take a look at your head.

430
00:31:51,534 --> 00:31:52,744
( beep )

431
00:31:54,996 --> 00:31:57,248
Who were you trying to contact?

432
00:31:57,332 --> 00:31:58,625
I'm sorry.

433
00:31:58,708 --> 00:32:01,085
-I asked you a question.
-I can't answer it.

434
00:32:05,173 --> 00:32:06,716
What did you do to T'Pol?

435
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:08,635
She shouldn't have resisted.

436
00:32:10,970 --> 00:32:12,388
Who are you?

437
00:32:12,472 --> 00:32:15,433
I told you. My name is Rajiin.

438
00:32:15,516 --> 00:32:17,352
That's right.

439
00:32:17,435 --> 00:32:20,897
Kidnapped when you were a child,
sold into a life of slavery.

440
00:32:21,898 --> 00:32:24,567
And it was just a coincidence
that you happened to escape

441
00:32:24,651 --> 00:32:26,903
when I was at that market.

442
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:30,823
The chemist knew I was
looking for information about the Xindi.

443
00:32:30,907 --> 00:32:33,493
Is that why you showed up so conveniently?

444
00:32:34,577 --> 00:32:38,039
The only thing I can tell you
is that you're in danger.

445
00:32:38,122 --> 00:32:40,583
Care to be a little more specific?

446
00:32:41,209 --> 00:32:44,420
If I say anything else, they'll kill me.

447
00:32:46,005 --> 00:32:48,883
Who? The Xindi?

448
00:32:51,552 --> 00:32:53,638
How do you know I won't do the same?

449
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:01,771
It's true that I deceived you.

450
00:33:02,981 --> 00:33:06,484
But that didn't make your decision
to help me any less admirable.

451
00:33:07,276 --> 00:33:09,612
I don't want to see you harmed, Captain.

452
00:33:11,072 --> 00:33:14,659
The best thing for you to do is let me go.

453
00:33:16,285 --> 00:33:18,538
Tell me who you contacted.

454
00:33:19,956 --> 00:33:20,999
Who?

455
00:33:22,333 --> 00:33:24,419
-( intercom beeping )
-MALCOLM: <i>Bridge to Captain Archer.</i>

456
00:33:32,218 --> 00:33:33,469
ARCHER: Go ahead.

457
00:33:33,553 --> 00:33:36,347
MALCOLM: <i>Two vessels </i>
<i>are approaching from aft.</i>

458
00:33:36,431 --> 00:33:38,224
Sir, the bio-signs
match the genetic profile

459
00:33:38,307 --> 00:33:40,143
of the Xindi pilot who attacked Earth.

460
00:33:40,977 --> 00:33:43,855
Hull plating to full power,
stand by weapons.

461
00:33:46,607 --> 00:33:48,109
The reptilian species.

462
00:33:49,235 --> 00:33:51,154
They're the ones who sent you.

463
00:33:54,282 --> 00:33:56,200
I had no choice.

464
00:34:08,296 --> 00:34:09,589
( rumbling )

465
00:34:09,672 --> 00:34:11,966
We're dropping out of warp.

466
00:34:22,810 --> 00:34:25,146
I assume they're here for you.

467
00:34:27,857 --> 00:34:31,277
They won't harm anyone
if you let me go.

468
00:34:31,527 --> 00:34:33,946
Forgive me if I don't
take your word on that,

469
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:37,283
but they murdered
seven million people on my planet.

470
00:34:37,366 --> 00:34:39,410
-( intercom beeps )
-MALCOLM: <i>Bridge to the captain.</i>

471
00:34:40,828 --> 00:34:42,413
Go ahead.

472
00:34:42,497 --> 00:34:44,957
The smaller ship is approaching
the starboard docking port.

473
00:34:45,041 --> 00:34:47,001
Seal that airlock and post security teams.

474
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:48,294
I'm on my way.

475
00:34:52,882 --> 00:34:54,342
What was your mission?

476
00:35:00,973 --> 00:35:04,227
-They wanted information.
-About what?

477
00:35:06,145 --> 00:35:07,313
About you.

478
00:35:09,315 --> 00:35:10,900
They're building a weapon.

479
00:35:10,983 --> 00:35:12,110
We know that.

480
00:35:13,653 --> 00:35:15,363
This is different.

481
00:35:15,446 --> 00:35:16,948
A bio-weapon.

482
00:35:18,908 --> 00:35:20,159
Go on.

483
00:35:21,285 --> 00:35:25,123
They need data about your species
before they can begin.

484
00:35:25,957 --> 00:35:27,792
Where are they building the weapon?

485
00:35:27,875 --> 00:35:29,544
I don't know.

486
00:35:29,627 --> 00:35:32,213
-When will it be ready?
-I don't know.

487
00:35:37,301 --> 00:35:39,095
They didn't tell me anything else.

488
00:35:41,556 --> 00:35:43,641
Get a security detail down here.

489
00:35:44,642 --> 00:35:46,394
No one's taking her anywhere.

490
00:36:16,007 --> 00:36:17,341
Fall back!

491
00:36:23,723 --> 00:36:25,766
( grunts )

492
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:27,310
( groaning )

493
00:36:45,536 --> 00:36:48,331
Three boarding parties,
at least five men each.

494
00:36:48,414 --> 00:36:49,749
They're headin' for the brig.

495
00:36:49,832 --> 00:36:51,626
Try to cut 'em off.

496
00:36:52,543 --> 00:36:54,003
You're with me.

497
00:37:09,227 --> 00:37:11,187
( grunts )

498
00:37:38,464 --> 00:37:40,758
( all groaning )

499
00:37:47,807 --> 00:37:48,849
( rattling )

500
00:37:48,933 --> 00:37:50,393
( weapon fires )

501
00:37:52,853 --> 00:37:55,189
( high-pitched beeping )

502
00:38:18,838 --> 00:38:20,131
( grunting )

503
00:38:35,187 --> 00:38:36,689
( grunts )

504
00:38:43,821 --> 00:38:45,323
( grunts )

505
00:38:47,199 --> 00:38:48,743
( panting )

506
00:38:48,826 --> 00:38:51,370
( beeping )

507
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:54,707
-Archer to the bridge.
-TRAVIS: <i>Go ahead.</i>

508
00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:57,084
Don't let those ships get away!
Lay in a pursuit course.

509
00:38:57,168 --> 00:38:58,586
Aye, sir.

510
00:39:10,806 --> 00:39:12,475
He's dead, sir.

511
00:39:12,558 --> 00:39:14,018
-( intercom beeps )
-Captain.

512
00:39:14,101 --> 00:39:17,146
Those ships just entered
some kind of vortex.

513
00:39:17,229 --> 00:39:18,230
( beeping )

514
00:39:18,314 --> 00:39:19,523
They're gone.

515
00:39:19,607 --> 00:39:21,776
( panting )

516
00:39:29,283 --> 00:39:32,286
This gland released
a fatal dose of neuro-toxin

517
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:34,121
into his bloodstream.

518
00:39:34,205 --> 00:39:36,916
What kind of species is born
with a suicide gland?

519
00:39:36,999 --> 00:39:42,046
Not this one. He was surgically enhanced,
if you can call it an enhancement.

520
00:39:42,129 --> 00:39:44,882
I want a complete autopsy, Doctor.

521
00:39:44,965 --> 00:39:48,094
And have Malcolm take this weapon apart.

522
00:39:48,177 --> 00:39:50,471
I want to find out
its range, power output,

523
00:39:50,554 --> 00:39:52,515
and how we can defend against it.

524
00:39:52,598 --> 00:39:53,891
Aye, sir.

525
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:58,771
Are you OK?

526
00:39:59,647 --> 00:40:00,981
Yes.

527
00:40:01,065 --> 00:40:02,024
Good.

528
00:40:02,108 --> 00:40:05,903
Because I want an analysis
of the scans we took of those Xindi ships

529
00:40:05,986 --> 00:40:08,364
and find out what you can
about that vortex they went through.

530
00:40:08,447 --> 00:40:11,242
I don't want them dropping in
unannounced again.

531
00:40:11,325 --> 00:40:12,910
Dismissed.

532
00:40:21,877 --> 00:40:24,672
You've put all of our work at risk.

533
00:40:24,755 --> 00:40:27,133
And exposed us to the humans.

534
00:40:27,216 --> 00:40:29,427
Allowed one of your soldiers
to be captured.

535
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:31,387
Ah! He wasn't taken alive.

536
00:40:31,470 --> 00:40:33,722
You agreed to give me more time.

537
00:40:34,432 --> 00:40:37,685
You don't have enough data
to construct the bio-weapon.

538
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:39,311
Don't we?

539
00:40:41,981 --> 00:40:43,232
Bring her!

540
00:40:43,315 --> 00:40:44,525
( footsteps approaching )

541
00:40:51,907 --> 00:40:53,159
Show them.

542
00:40:57,204 --> 00:40:58,330
Show them!

543
00:41:12,803 --> 00:41:15,139
We couldn't pursue the bio-weapon

544
00:41:15,222 --> 00:41:20,019
because we didn't have enough information
about the humans.

545
00:41:22,813 --> 00:41:24,482
Now we do.

546
00:41:24,690 --> 00:41:27,443
{\an8}( screeching )

547
00:41:28,027 --> 00:41:32,239
Do you expect us to reward you
for this act of insubordination?

548
00:41:34,074 --> 00:41:37,328
This has left us more vulnerable
than we were before.

549
00:41:37,411 --> 00:41:38,913
There's more to these humans

550
00:41:38,996 --> 00:41:41,165
than you can learn
from a set of biometric scans.

551
00:41:41,248 --> 00:41:42,583
That's enough!

552
00:41:43,792 --> 00:41:44,919
Take her.
