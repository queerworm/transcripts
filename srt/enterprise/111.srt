00:17:25,252 --> 00:17:26,546
-IT'S IMPORTANT.
-I'M SORRY, DANIELS.

351
00:17:26,587 --> 00:17:27,755
I'VE GOT MY HANDS FULL.

352
00:17:27,797 --> 00:17:29,215
DANIELS: IT'S ABOUT
THE SULIBAN.

353
00:17:29,256 --> 00:17:30,591
WHAT ABOUT THEM?

354
00:17:30,633 --> 00:17:32,218
DANIELS: I HAVE
REASON TO BELIEVE

355
00:17:32,259 --> 00:17:33,887
THAT ONE OF THE PILGRIMS
WHO CAME ABOARD TODAY

356
00:17:33,928 --> 00:17:35,471
IS A SULIBAN SOLDIER.

357
00:17:35,513 --> 00:17:37,849
HIS NAME IS SILIK.

358
00:17:37,891 --> 00:17:40,643
HE'S THE MAN YOU FOUGHT WITH
ON THE HELIX.

359
00:17:43,103 --> 00:17:45,815
HOW THE HELL DO YOU KNOW
WHAT I DID ON THE HELIX?

360
00:17:47,901 --> 00:17:49,819
IT MIGHT BE BEST
IF WE DISCUSSED THIS

361
00:17:49,861 --> 00:17:51,445
IN PRIVATE.

362
00:17:51,487 --> 00:17:52,906
MY READY ROOM.

363
00:17:52,947 --> 00:17:54,574
I THINK IT WOULD BE BETTER
IF WE WENT TO MY QUARTERS.

364
00:17:54,615 --> 00:17:55,867
WHAT?

365
00:17:55,909 --> 00:17:58,369
YOU'LL UNDERSTAND
WHEN WE GET THERE, SIR.

366
00:18:06,961 --> 00:18:09,296
OH, PLEASE, HAVE A SEAT.

367
00:18:09,338 --> 00:18:10,924
I'M SORRY ABOUT THE MESS.

368
00:18:10,965 --> 00:18:14,677
SOMETIMES I THINK MY BUNK-MATE
MAJORED IN CHAOS THEORY.

369
00:18:17,221 --> 00:18:19,098
WHAT IS THAT?

370
00:18:19,139 --> 00:18:21,684
ARCHER: THAT DOESN'T LOOK
LIKE STARFLEET ISSUE.

371
00:18:21,726 --> 00:18:23,728
DANIELS: IT'S BECAUSE I'M NOT
A MEMBER OF STARFLEET.

372
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:26,397
NOT THAT I WOULDN'T
BE HONORED TO BE ONE, SIR,

373
00:18:26,439 --> 00:18:27,690
ESPECIALLY AFTER
SPENDING TIME--

374
00:18:27,732 --> 00:18:29,067
WHO ARE YOU?

375
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:31,611
HOW DO YOU KNOW WHAT
HAPPENED ON THE HELIX?

376
00:18:31,652 --> 00:18:33,571
DID SILIK TELL YOU WHO
HE WAS WORKING FOR?

377
00:18:33,613 --> 00:18:36,866
ARCHER: I'M THE ONE ASKING
QUESTIONS, CREWMAN.

378
00:18:36,908 --> 00:18:40,244
DID HE MENTION
THE TEMPORAL COLD WAR?

379
00:18:41,913 --> 00:18:43,831
WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT THAT?

380
00:18:43,873 --> 00:18:46,960
A GREAT DEAL MORE
THAN YOU DO, SIR.

381
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:50,671
IF YOU'RE NOT A MEMBER
OF STARFLEET,

382
00:18:50,713 --> 00:18:52,632
THEN WHO ARE YOU?

383
00:18:52,673 --> 00:18:56,176
I WORK FOR A DIFFERENT KIND
OF ORGANIZATION.

384
00:18:56,218 --> 00:18:58,220
WE MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE
LIKE SILIK DON'T

385
00:18:58,262 --> 00:19:00,180
INTERFERE WITH
HISTORICAL EVENTS.

386
00:19:00,222 --> 00:19:02,934
I'VE NEVER HEARD OF
A GROUP LIKE THAT.

387
00:19:02,976 --> 00:19:05,478
THAT'S BECAUSE
IT DOESN'T EXIST YET.

388
00:19:08,815 --> 00:19:11,317
SO YOU'RE...TELLING ME

389
00:19:11,358 --> 00:19:13,987
YOU'RE SOME KIND
OF A TIME TRAVELER?

390
00:19:14,028 --> 00:19:16,238
THAT'S ONE WAY OF PUTTING IT.

391
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:19,617
MAYBE THIS WILL HELP
CLEAR THINGS UP.

392
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:25,623
THIS IS HOW WE KEEP AN EYE
ON WHAT'S GOING ON.

393
00:19:25,665 --> 00:19:28,501
YOU MIGHT CALL IT
A TEMPORAL OBSERVATORY.

394
00:19:30,753 --> 00:19:34,841
I KNOW THIS MUST SEEM
A LITTLE OVERWHELMING.

395
00:19:34,882 --> 00:19:36,717
OVERWHELMING...

396
00:19:36,759 --> 00:19:39,386
DOESN'T QUITE COVER IT.

397
00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:43,016
I COME FROM RIGHT ABOUT,
UH...RIGHT ABOUT HERE,

398
00:19:43,057 --> 00:19:45,768
APPROXIMATELY 900 YEARS
FROM NOW.

399
00:19:47,645 --> 00:19:49,605
ARE YOU HUMAN?

400
00:19:49,647 --> 00:19:51,273
MORE OR LESS.

401
00:19:54,986 --> 00:19:57,571
AND THE PEOPLE GIVING
SILIK ORDERS?

402
00:19:57,613 --> 00:19:59,615
THEY'RE FROM AN EARLIER CENTURY,

403
00:19:59,657 --> 00:20:02,284
FROM ABOUT...HERE.

404
00:20:02,326 --> 00:20:05,538
THEY CAN'T MANIFEST THEMSELVES
PHYSICALLY IN THE PAST.

405
00:20:05,579 --> 00:20:07,498
THEY CAN ONLY
PARTIALLY MATERIALIZE

406
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:09,458
TO DELIVER INFORMATION.

407
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:12,461
-BUT NOT YOU?
-IN THE YEARS THAT FOLLOWED,

408
00:20:12,503 --> 00:20:14,630
WE EVENTUALLY PERFECTED
THE PROCESS.

409
00:20:14,672 --> 00:20:16,883
SOUNDS DANGEROUS.

410
00:20:16,924 --> 00:20:18,467
WHEN TIME TRAVEL WAS
FIRST DEVELOPED,

411
00:20:18,509 --> 00:20:19,802
IT WASN'T LONG
BEFORE PEOPLE REALIZED

412
00:20:19,844 --> 00:20:21,428
THAT LAWS HAD TO BE MADE.

413
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:23,430
ALL THE SPECIES WHO HAD
THE TECHNOLOGY AGREED

414
00:20:23,472 --> 00:20:25,725
THAT IT WOULD ONLY
BE USED FOR RESEARCH.

415
00:20:25,766 --> 00:20:27,685
BUT IT WASN'T.

416
00:20:27,727 --> 00:20:31,189
THAT'S WHAT THE TEMPORAL
COLD WAR IS ALL ABOUT.

417
00:20:32,815 --> 00:20:34,734
LOOK AT THIS.

418
00:20:34,775 --> 00:20:38,738
THIS IS A GROUP
OF ANTHROPOLOGISTS FROM 2769

419
00:20:38,779 --> 00:20:42,116
OBSERVING THE CONSTRUCTION
OF THE GREAT PYRAMID AT GIZA.

420
00:20:42,158 --> 00:20:44,618
THEY'RE DOING IT USING
THE PROPER PROCEDURES

421
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:47,246
SET FORTH
IN THE TEMPORAL ACCORD.

422
00:20:47,287 --> 00:20:50,875
BUT THERE ARE FACTIONS
THAT IGNORE THOSE PROCEDURES.

423
00:20:50,917 --> 00:20:53,377
WHY ARE YOU TELLING ME
ALL THIS?

424
00:20:59,133 --> 00:21:01,844
SILIK IS THE ONE WHO
PREVENTED THE REACTOR BREACH.

425
00:21:04,764 --> 00:21:08,935
ARE YOU IMPLYING SILIK WAS
SENT HERE TO SAVE MY SHIP?

426
00:21:08,976 --> 00:21:10,937
AND IF HE HADN'T,

427
00:21:10,978 --> 00:21:13,189
WE WOULD HAVE BEEN
DESTROYED TODAY?

428
00:21:13,231 --> 00:21:15,149
I AM NOT IMPLYING ANYTHING.

429
00:21:15,191 --> 00:21:17,610
ALL I'M SAYING IS THAT
I WAS ASSIGNED HERE

430
00:21:17,651 --> 00:21:20,071
TO CAPTURE SILIK
WHEN HE CAME ABOARD.

431
00:21:20,113 --> 00:21:23,908
HE IS A THREAT, AND I NEED YOU
TO HELP ME CAPTURE HIM.

432
00:21:25,576 --> 00:21:27,578
YOU'RE FROM...

433
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:30,206
900 YEARS IN THE FUTURE,

434
00:21:30,248 --> 00:21:32,166
AND YOU NEED MY HELP?

435
00:21:32,208 --> 00:21:34,627
THE SULIBAN HAVE BEEN GIVEN
GENETIC ENHANCEMENTS

436
00:21:34,668 --> 00:21:36,295
THAT ALLOW THEM
TO EVADE MOST SENSORS.

437
00:21:36,336 --> 00:21:38,965
THEY'RE NEARLY
IMPOSSIBLE TO DETECT.

438
00:21:39,006 --> 00:21:40,591
I'VE NOTICED.

439
00:21:40,633 --> 00:21:43,761
I HAVE SPECIAL EQUIPMENT
THAT CAN HELP TRACK SILIK,

440
00:21:43,803 --> 00:21:46,472
BUT IT'LL BE FAR MORE EFFECTIVE
IF I CAN TIE IT IN

441
00:21:46,513 --> 00:21:48,015
TO YOUR INTERNAL SENSOR GRID.

442
00:21:48,057 --> 00:21:50,101
I'LL NEED ACCESS
TO MAIN ENGINEERING

443
00:21:50,143 --> 00:21:52,436
AND YOUR COMMAND CODES.

444
00:21:52,478 --> 00:21:56,107
WE HAVE REASON TO BELIEVE
THAT THE 22nd CENTURY

445
00:21:56,149 --> 00:21:57,900
IS A FRONT IN THIS COLD WAR.

446
00:21:57,942 --> 00:22:01,654
WHAT HAPPENS HERE COULD AFFECT
MILLENNIA TO COME.

447
00:22:01,695 --> 00:22:03,281
IT'S IMPERATIVE
THAT WE FIND OUT

448
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:06,993
WHO SILIK IS WORKING FOR
AND WHAT THEY'RE TRYING TO DO.

449
00:22:09,954 --> 00:22:13,415
IF I DECIDE TO HELP YOU,

450
00:22:13,457 --> 00:22:15,584
I CAN'T DO IT ALONE.

451
00:22:15,626 --> 00:22:18,504
I NEED TO INFORM
SOME OF MY CREW.

452
00:22:18,545 --> 00:22:20,923
THE FEWER THE BETTER.

453
00:22:26,595 --> 00:22:29,640
YOU'RE ASKING ME
TO CAPTURE SOMEONE

454
00:22:29,682 --> 00:22:32,350
WHO JUST SAVED MY SHIP.

455
00:22:33,853 --> 00:22:35,771
WHY SHOULD I TRUST YOU?

456
00:22:35,813 --> 00:22:39,192
YOU LIKE
YOUR SCRAMBLED EGGS SOFT.

457
00:22:39,233 --> 00:22:42,569
HAVE I EVER BROUGHT THEM
TO YOU ANY OTHER WAY?

458
00:22:46,032 --> 00:22:47,867
YOU SURE
YOU DON'T WANT A GLASS?

459
00:22:47,908 --> 00:22:50,286
I'M SURE.

460
00:22:50,328 --> 00:22:53,331
THE VULCAN SCIENCE DIRECTORATE
HAS STUDIED THE QUESTION

461
00:22:53,371 --> 00:22:56,167
OF TIME TRAVEL IN GREAT DETAIL.

462
00:22:56,209 --> 00:22:58,836
THEY FOUND NO EVIDENCE
THAT IT EXISTS

463
00:22:58,878 --> 00:23:01,047
OR THAT IT CAN EXIST.

464
00:23:01,088 --> 00:23:04,050
THE SULIBAN WOMAN
I SPOKE WITH -- SARIN --

465
00:23:04,091 --> 00:23:07,469
SHE ALSO USED THE PHRASE
"TEMPORAL COLD WAR."

466
00:23:07,511 --> 00:23:09,847
-THAT'S WHAT DANIELS CALLED IT?
-THE SAME WORDS.

467
00:23:09,889 --> 00:23:12,141
THAT PROVES NOTHING.

468
00:23:12,183 --> 00:23:15,561
WHAT ABOUT THE SULIBAN'S
GENETIC ENGINEERING?

469
00:23:15,602 --> 00:23:18,731
PHLOX SAYS IT'S FAR
BEYOND THEIR ABILITIES.

470
00:23:18,772 --> 00:23:20,316
THAT DOESN'T MEAN
THAT IT WAS GIVEN TO THEM

471
00:23:20,358 --> 00:23:22,484
BY VISITORS FROM THE FUTURE.

472
00:23:22,526 --> 00:23:26,113
UNTIL DANIELS CAN OFFER YOU
CONCRETE PROOF,

473
00:23:26,155 --> 00:23:28,949
I'D REMAIN EXTREMELY SKEPTICAL.

474
00:23:28,991 --> 00:23:32,245
I'M TELLING YOU, HE PUSHED
A BUTTON ON THIS DEVICE

475
00:23:32,286 --> 00:23:34,205
AND THE WHOLE ROOM CHANGED.

476
00:23:34,247 --> 00:23:36,582
ON THE XYRILLIAN SHIP,
I WAS IN A HOLOGRAPHIC CHAMBER

477
00:23:36,623 --> 00:23:39,293
WHERE I COULD'VE SWORN
I WAS IN A BOAT AT SEA.

478
00:23:39,335 --> 00:23:42,255
IF WHAT DANIELS SAYS IS TRUE,

479
00:23:42,296 --> 00:23:44,840
THEN SILIK SAVED<i> ENTERPRISE.</i>

480
00:23:44,882 --> 00:23:47,843
MAYBE WE SHOULDN'T LOOK
A GIFT HORSE IN THE MOUTH.

481
00:23:47,885 --> 00:23:50,263
IF THERE'S EVEN A POSSIBILITY
THAT THIS COLD WAR EXISTS,

482
00:23:50,304 --> 00:23:52,598
WE CAN'T IGNORE
DANIELS' REQUEST.

483
00:23:52,639 --> 00:23:55,309
Bridge to Captain Archer.

484
00:23:57,270 --> 00:23:58,520
YES, HOSHI?

485
00:23:58,562 --> 00:24:00,898
We're approaching
the protostar, sir, and

486
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:03,859
THE TRANSPORT SHIP IS REQUESTING
PERMISSION TO DOCK.

487
00:24:03,901 --> 00:24:05,485
SOME OF THE PASSENGERS
WOULD LIKE TO TAKE YOU UP

488
00:24:05,527 --> 00:24:08,281
ON YOUR OFFER AND OBSERVE IT
FROM THE MESS HALL.

489
00:24:08,322 --> 00:24:10,866
INITIATE DOCKING PROCEDURES.

490
00:24:10,908 --> 00:24:13,911
I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.

491
00:24:13,953 --> 00:24:16,122
ONE OF THEM MIGHT BE SILIK.

492
00:24:16,163 --> 00:24:20,209
WE DON'T HAVE TIME
TO DEBATE THIS ANY LONGER.

493
00:24:20,251 --> 00:24:22,920
I WANT YOU TO HELP DANIELS.

494
00:24:32,888 --> 00:24:35,057
I ALWAYS KNEW WE'D
BE MEETING PEOPLE

495
00:24:35,099 --> 00:24:37,059
FROM OTHER PLANETS, BUT...

496
00:24:37,101 --> 00:24:39,145
OTHER CENTURIES?

497
00:24:40,938 --> 00:24:43,649
YOU'RE NOT BUYING ANY
OF THIS, ARE YOU?

498
00:24:43,690 --> 00:24:46,652
IF DANIELS COULD TRAVEL
THROUGH TIME,

499
00:24:46,693 --> 00:24:49,947
WHY NOT SIMPLY GO BACK ONE MORE
DAY INTO THE PAST AND PREVENT

500
00:24:49,989 --> 00:24:52,325
SILIK FROM BOARDING THIS SHIP
IN THE FIRST PLACE?

501
00:24:52,366 --> 00:24:54,243
MAYBE THAT'S PLAN "B."

502
00:24:54,285 --> 00:24:57,121
OR MAYBE HE'S REALLY
NOT FROM THE FUTURE.

503
00:24:57,163 --> 00:25:00,333
THEN WHY MAKE UP SUCH
A CRAZY STORY?

504
00:25:00,374 --> 00:25:03,210
HE COULD BE TRYING TO CONCEAL
HIS TRUE INTENTIONS.

505
00:25:03,252 --> 00:25:04,837
I THOUGHT YOU SCIENTISTS

506
00:25:04,878 --> 00:25:06,422
WERE SUPPOSED
TO KEEP AN OPEN MIND.

507
00:25:06,464 --> 00:25:09,467
THERE'S A DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN KEEPING AN OPEN MIND

508
00:25:09,507 --> 00:25:13,053
AND BELIEVING SOMETHING
BECAUSE YOU WANT IT TO BE TRUE.

509
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:18,017
WHAT THE HELL'S THAT
SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

510
00:25:27,609 --> 00:25:31,155
[ PHLOX SPEAKING
FOREIGN LANGUAGE ] ...CAPTAIN.

511
00:25:31,197 --> 00:25:33,573
THAT IS A TRADITIONAL GREETING
ON THE MORNING OF AGOSORIA.

512
00:25:33,615 --> 00:25:36,576
IT MEANS, "MAY THE PLUME
LIGHT YOUR WAY." HEH HEH!

513
00:25:36,618 --> 00:25:37,870
TAKE IT
YOU ENJOYED YOUR VISIT.

514
00:25:37,911 --> 00:25:39,288
OH, IT WAS MESMERIZING.

515
00:25:39,330 --> 00:25:40,998
FOUR HOURS OF RITUAL PRAYER,

516
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:44,502
FOLLOWED BY THE<i> KAANA-SAH,</i> 
A SERIES OF EXERCISES

517
00:25:44,542 --> 00:25:47,046
DESIGNED TO PURIFY
THE BODY. HEH HEH!

518
00:25:47,087 --> 00:25:50,007
I THINK I STRAINED A LEG MUSCLE,
