523
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,757
STAY BACK.

524
00:38:22,508 --> 00:38:23,885
I'LL KILL HER.

525
00:38:39,067 --> 00:38:42,654
SECURE THE AREA!
FIND THE CAPTAIN!

526
00:38:46,116 --> 00:38:48,409
[ HORSE NEIGHS ]

527
00:39:19,149 --> 00:39:20,942
[ GRUNTS ]

528
00:39:36,499 --> 00:39:39,878
WE'RE UP TOO HIGH TO SEE IT,
BUT YOUR TOWN IS DOWN THERE.

529
00:39:42,088 --> 00:39:44,590
TOWARD THE RIGHT EDGE
OF THAT MOUNTAIN RANGE.

530
00:39:47,468 --> 00:39:49,512
HOW ARE YOU FEELING?

531
00:39:49,512 --> 00:39:52,224
I FEEL FINE.

532
00:39:52,224 --> 00:39:54,017
NOT EVEN A SCAR.

533
00:39:54,017 --> 00:39:56,561
DR. PHLOX DOES EXCELLENT WORK.

534
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:02,192
YOU MUST THINK WE'RE BARBARIC.

535
00:40:04,736 --> 00:40:07,530
ALL THE THINGS
HUMANITY HAS ACCOMPLISHED --

536
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:12,202
BUILDING SHIPS LIKE THIS,
TRAVELING TO OTHER WORLDS.

537
00:40:12,202 --> 00:40:14,871
AND WE'RE STILL DOWN THERE
SHOOTING EACH OTHER.

538
00:40:17,123 --> 00:40:19,709
THE PROGRESS ON EARTH,

539
00:40:19,709 --> 00:40:21,544
IT DIDN'T HAPPEN OVERNIGHT.

540
00:40:21,544 --> 00:40:24,089
BUT IT WAS PROGRESS
ALL THE SAME.

541
00:40:24,089 --> 00:40:28,385
YOU'VE MANAGED TO CHANGE.
WE HAVEN'T.

542
00:40:28,385 --> 00:40:30,970
EVEN IF YOU COULD TAKE US BACK,
I DON'T THINK WE'RE READY.

543
00:40:33,556 --> 00:40:35,350
IT MAY BE AWHILE
BEFORE WE'RE ABLE

544
00:40:35,350 --> 00:40:37,018
TO START SENDING SHIPS HERE.

545
00:40:38,686 --> 00:40:41,814
MY GUESS IS,
BY THE TIME THEY ARRIVE,

546
00:40:41,814 --> 00:40:44,025
THEY'LL FIND
THINGS HAVE CHANGED.

547
00:40:45,902 --> 00:40:47,570
I THINK YOU'RE GIVING US
TOO MUCH CREDIT.

548
00:40:47,570 --> 00:40:50,489
IT'S HAPPENING ALREADY.
I SPOKE WITH MACREADY.

549
00:40:50,489 --> 00:40:55,036
HE AGREES THAT,
IN LIGHT OF RECENT EVENTS,

550
00:40:55,036 --> 00:40:57,872
SOME OF YOUR LAWS
MIGHT BE A LITTLE OUTDATED.

551
00:41:09,634 --> 00:41:12,637
BEFORE PEOPLE COULD TRAVEL
THROUGH SPACE TO OTHER PLANETS,

552
00:41:12,637 --> 00:41:15,390
THEY HAD TO
GET OFF THE GROUND FIRST.

553
00:41:15,390 --> 00:41:19,518
ALMOST 40 YEARS AFTER
MY HUMAN ANCESTORS LEFT EARTH,

554
00:41:19,518 --> 00:41:22,939
TWO BROTHERS FROM OHIO
BECAME THE FIRST HUMAN BEINGS

555
00:41:22,939 --> 00:41:26,401
TO BUILD
A SUCCESSFUL FLYING MACHINE.

556
00:41:26,401 --> 00:41:30,363
THEIR NAMES WERE
ORVILLE AND WILBUR WRIGHT.

557
00:41:32,365 --> 00:41:34,367
WOULD ANYONE LIKE TO SEE
A PICTURE OF THEIR AIRPLANE?

558
00:41:34,367 --> 00:41:35,994
-ME!
-YES'M.

559
00:41:35,994 --> 00:41:39,038
OH, YOU ALL WOULD.
WELL, HERE IT IS, RIGHT HERE.

560
00:41:39,038 --> 00:41:41,249
AND YOU CAN SEE,
HERE'S ORVILLE WRIGHT,

561
00:41:41,249 --> 00:41:43,835
AND HIS BROTHER, WILBUR,
IS FLYING THE PLANE.

562
00:41:43,835 --> 00:41:46,212
NOW, THIS IS A MACHINE
THAT ACTUALLY...
