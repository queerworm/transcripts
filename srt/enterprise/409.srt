1
00:00:01,626 --> 00:00:03,336
T'POL: <i>Previously on </i>Enterprise...

2
00:00:04,254 --> 00:00:06,005
ARCHER: <i>Admiral Forrest has been killed.</i>

3
00:00:06,297 --> 00:00:10,093
Syrrannites were responsible,
and they'll be dealt with accordingly.

4
00:00:10,176 --> 00:00:12,846
Your position is terminated immediately.

5
00:00:12,929 --> 00:00:15,640
-( explosion )
-ARCHER: Surak.

6
00:00:15,724 --> 00:00:19,561
You're seeing the past through my eyes.

7
00:00:19,644 --> 00:00:22,105
The culture you've come to know
isn't the one I helped to create.

8
00:00:22,188 --> 00:00:24,941
ARCHER: <i>Syrran did something to me</i>
<i>before he died.</i>

9
00:00:25,024 --> 00:00:26,359
MAN: <i>He chose you.</i>

10
00:00:26,943 --> 00:00:28,028
( gasps )

11
00:00:28,695 --> 00:00:30,780
He has Surak's Katra.

12
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:33,742
We can't reach them,
and they can't reach us.

13
00:00:33,825 --> 00:00:35,827
They may be in grave danger.

14
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:40,915
Find what my people have lost.
Find the Kir'Shara.

15
00:00:43,334 --> 00:00:46,463
Blanket the area. Use all necessary force.

16
00:00:46,546 --> 00:00:48,548
<i>Make sure there are no survivors.</i>

17
00:00:48,631 --> 00:00:50,300
You're presiding over a massacre.

18
00:00:50,383 --> 00:00:53,344
The High Command is planning
to attack Andoria.

19
00:00:53,428 --> 00:00:55,638
He's gonna start an interstellar war.

20
00:00:55,722 --> 00:00:58,641
Set a course for Andoria. Maximum warp.

21
00:00:58,725 --> 00:01:00,977
T'POL: <i>And now the conclusion...</i>

22
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:03,730
MALE: The Andorians have deployed
most of their fleet

23
00:01:03,813 --> 00:01:06,149
in defensive positions around Paan Mokar.

24
00:01:06,232 --> 00:01:09,486
We gave them that planet
when we signed the treaty.

25
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:11,654
Why would they move their forces there?

26
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:13,698
They believe we're preparing to retake it.

27
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:15,784
We've been using unmanned probes

28
00:01:15,867 --> 00:01:18,745
to generate false warp signatures
in that system.

29
00:01:18,828 --> 00:01:20,914
Why weren't we informed of this?

30
00:01:20,997 --> 00:01:25,710
It's possible that Andorian agents
have penetrated the High Command.

31
00:01:25,794 --> 00:01:29,088
It's necessary to limit access
to this information.

32
00:01:30,548 --> 00:01:33,510
Our forces are actually stationed here,

33
00:01:33,593 --> 00:01:36,262
preparing to launch
an invasion of Andoria.

34
00:01:36,346 --> 00:01:39,182
There are members of the Council
who are not convinced

35
00:01:39,265 --> 00:01:42,018
an invasion is necessary at this time.

36
00:01:42,101 --> 00:01:45,855
We know they have the Xindi technology.
You've all seen the data.

37
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:47,982
Data can be falsified.

38
00:01:49,901 --> 00:01:53,113
We received this sensor telemetry
two days ago.

39
00:01:53,196 --> 00:01:57,408
It was recorded by the Andorian ship
that stole the Xindi prototype.

40
00:02:03,748 --> 00:02:06,751
Our operatives tell us
the prototype was taken back

41
00:02:06,835 --> 00:02:09,212
to Andoria where it was disassembled.

42
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:12,340
We have reason to believe
the imperial guard

43
00:02:12,423 --> 00:02:15,718
plans to equip their vessels
with similar weaponry.

44
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:18,138
Do you have evidence of this?

45
00:02:18,221 --> 00:02:22,433
They didn't steal the prototype
because they were merely curious.

46
00:02:22,517 --> 00:02:24,310
I'm certain of one thing.

47
00:02:24,394 --> 00:02:25,603
Sooner or later,

48
00:02:25,687 --> 00:02:29,065
the Andorians will make use
of this technology.

49
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:33,444
Is it logical for us to wait for that day?

They'll care for the wounded.

72
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:09,415
-How far to the capital?
-Two days.

73
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:12,001
We need to get back to <i>Enterprise.</i>

74
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:14,170
Tell Starfleet what we've learned about
the embassy bombing.

75
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:16,172
We have a more important mission.

76
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:18,174
We've got to get this to the capital.

77
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:20,009
I don't understand.

78
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:22,345
{\an8}The Kir'Shara contains
Surak's original writings.

79
00:04:22,428 --> 00:04:25,473
{\an8}It's the only surviving record
of his true teachings.

80
00:04:25,556 --> 00:04:28,768
{\an8}It would have an enormous impact
on the High Command

81
00:04:28,851 --> 00:04:30,979
{\an8}and all of Vulcan.

82
00:04:32,146 --> 00:04:33,898
{\an8}( sighs )

83
00:04:39,696 --> 00:04:41,572
{\an8}MALCOLM: I've got two teams working on it.

84
00:04:41,656 --> 00:04:43,491
{\an8}Both launchers should be online
in a few hours.

85
00:04:43,574 --> 00:04:44,826
{\an8}Anything else?

86
00:04:46,202 --> 00:04:47,954
{\an8}Permission to speak freely?

87
00:04:51,249 --> 00:04:54,627
{\an8}Admiral Gardner ordered us
to return to Earth.

88
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:57,422
{\an8}Yet we've set a course
for Andorian territory.

89
00:04:57,505 --> 00:04:58,881
{\an8}We are going back.

90
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:01,301
{\an8}We're just taking a small detour first.

91
00:05:02,593 --> 00:05:05,680
{\an8}Have you told Starfleet
you're planning to warn the Andorians?

92
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:07,765
{\an8}No.

93
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:12,103
{\an8}Have you any idea what the Admiral
will do when he finds out?

94
00:05:12,186 --> 00:05:14,522
{\an8}I'll save you a seat at my court-martial.

95
00:05:14,605 --> 00:05:15,898
{\an8}Is there anything else?

96
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:19,444
{\an8}The Vulcans have legitimate reasons
for launching this strike.

97
00:05:19,527 --> 00:05:22,989
{\an8}If we alert the Andorians,
we will be betraying our closest ally.

98
00:05:23,072 --> 00:05:25,199
{\an8}I'm trying to prevent a war, Malcolm...

99
00:05:25,283 --> 00:05:26,909
{\an8}A war that Earth could get drawn into.

100
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:30,872
{\an8}With all due respect, sir,
we shouldn't get involved.

101
00:05:30,955 --> 00:05:33,041
{\an8}We're already involved!

102
00:05:33,124 --> 00:05:34,667
{\an8}( door chimes )

103
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:36,335
{\an8}Come in.

104
00:05:37,754 --> 00:05:39,464
{\an8}That'll be all, Lieutenant.

105
00:05:39,547 --> 00:05:41,090
{\an8}-Sir?
-Dismissed.

106
00:05:51,225 --> 00:05:53,770
{\an8}-You asked for me, Commander?
-I've been thinking.

107
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:57,648
{\an8}There's no guarantee
the Imperial Guard's gonna believe us.

108
00:05:57,732 --> 00:06:00,526
{\an8}We've got no evidence
your people are planning this attack.

109
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:03,863
{\an8}But there is one Andorian
who might trust us.

110
00:06:03,946 --> 00:06:06,032
{\an8}At least he does some of the time.

111
00:06:06,115 --> 00:06:07,492
{\an8}Commander Shran.

112
00:06:07,575 --> 00:06:09,660
{\an8}Problem is,
I have no idea how to find him.

113
00:06:10,995 --> 00:06:13,247
{\an8}I may be able to help.

114
00:06:14,457 --> 00:06:15,541
Good.

115
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:20,797
Lieutenant Reed appeared unsettled.

116
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:25,051
Some of the crew are wondering
if I'm doing the right thing.

117
00:06:26,135 --> 00:06:29,764
Can't say I blame them.
I'm not so sure myself.

118
00:06:29,847 --> 00:06:34,102
I have no doubt Captain Archer
would pursue this same course of action.

119
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:37,772
That's what I keep telling myself.

120
00:06:45,571 --> 00:06:48,783
<i>Enterprise </i>will be scanning for us
at the transport coordinates.

121
00:06:48,866 --> 00:06:50,243
One of us should go there.

122
00:06:50,326 --> 00:06:52,411
It's too dangerous.
We're staying together.

123
00:06:52,495 --> 00:06:55,540
Taking the artifact to the High Command
will accomplish nothing.

124
00:06:55,623 --> 00:06:57,625
It might be the only thing
that can stop the war.

125
00:06:57,708 --> 00:06:58,835
What war?

126
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:00,711
Between Vulcan and Andoria.

127
00:07:00,795 --> 00:07:04,298
We settled our dispute
with the Andorians nearly two years ago.

128
00:07:04,382 --> 00:07:06,592
V'Las was just stalling for time.

129
00:07:06,676 --> 00:07:09,470
He's been preparing
a large-scale attack ever since.

130
00:07:09,554 --> 00:07:11,931
Where did you get this information?

131
00:07:12,765 --> 00:07:13,850
Where do you think?

132
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:21,232
Assuming for the moment
you possess Surak's Katra,

133
00:07:21,315 --> 00:07:23,192
he's been dead for centuries.

134
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:25,862
How could he be aware of plans for a war?

135
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:29,323
Some of Syrran's memories
must have been transferred in the meld.

136
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:33,077
Captain.

137
00:07:34,078 --> 00:07:35,371
You think I've lost my mind?

138
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:38,541
I'm not certain your mind
is the one making these decisions.

139
00:07:41,836 --> 00:07:43,671
We should return to the ship.

140
00:07:43,754 --> 00:07:45,756
T'Pau can take the artifact
to the capital.

141
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,176
I was chosen for this.

142
00:07:48,259 --> 00:07:49,510
Chosen?

143
00:07:49,594 --> 00:07:52,305
Interesting choice of words.

144
00:07:52,388 --> 00:07:54,599
If I were in your shoes,
I'd be just as skeptical.

145
00:07:54,682 --> 00:07:56,392
( sighs )

146
00:07:56,476 --> 00:08:00,188
I'm not possessed and I'm not delusional.

147
00:08:00,271 --> 00:08:02,815
There are forces at work
on your world right now,

148
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:06,152
trying to undo everything
Surak taught your people.

149
00:08:06,235 --> 00:08:09,822
If we fail,
Vulcan will be consumed by them.

150
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:12,450
That's why we have to get
this thing to the capital.

151
00:08:12,533 --> 00:08:14,911
And I'm gonna need
all three of us to try and find--

152
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:17,079
Archer! Don't move.

153
00:08:18,873 --> 00:08:20,374
Gallicite deposits.

154
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:23,002
Are you in possession
of anything metallic?

155
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:26,923
Just this.

156
00:08:30,051 --> 00:08:32,970
( electricity buzzing )

157
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:37,016
Thanks for the warning.

158
00:08:42,813 --> 00:08:44,649
Our patrol has returned.

159
00:08:44,732 --> 00:08:46,776
They captured eight Syrrannites
from the sanctuary.

160
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:48,569
Was Syrran among them?

161
00:08:48,653 --> 00:08:50,321
No. He is dead.

162
00:08:50,988 --> 00:08:55,910
The Syrrannites say that there were
three other survivors, including a human.

163
00:08:56,827 --> 00:08:57,912
Archer.

164
00:08:57,995 --> 00:09:00,957
They say that
he is carrying the Kir'Shara.

165
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,334
The Kir'Shara never existed.

166
00:09:03,668 --> 00:09:08,631
There are scholars who believe it does
and that it was hidden in the forge.

167
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:09,966
The Syrrannites claim

168
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:12,927
that they are following
the true path of Surak.

169
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:16,264
If the Kir'Shara is real,
it could prove them right.

170
00:09:16,347 --> 00:09:18,349
It doesn't exist!

171
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:22,645
You've been listening
to Syrrannite propaganda.

172
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:25,773
That will be all, Minister.

173
00:09:41,372 --> 00:09:44,834
Sublieutenant, order Major Talok

174
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:47,378
to find the remaining Syrrannites.

175
00:09:47,461 --> 00:09:50,715
We're dealing with radical insurgents.

176
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:54,969
They're to be eradicated.

177
00:09:55,636 --> 00:09:57,847
Do I make myself clear?

178
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,983
Open a channel.

179
00:10:09,066 --> 00:10:11,277
-To who?
-The Nebula.

180
00:10:15,865 --> 00:10:17,908
-( beep )
-This is Ambassador Soval.

181
00:10:17,992 --> 00:10:19,869
I've come on an urgent mission.

182
00:10:19,952 --> 00:10:22,997
I must speak with Commander Shran.

183
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:28,836
The High Command has decrypted
your security protocols.

184
00:10:28,919 --> 00:10:33,007
We're well aware that your task force
has been hiding in this nebula.

185
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:37,845
Maybe your information's out of date.

186
00:10:37,928 --> 00:10:39,305
He's in there.

187
00:10:42,224 --> 00:10:44,894
This is Commander Tucker of <i>Enterprise.</i>

188
00:10:44,977 --> 00:10:49,023
We've got some information
you're gonna want to hear.

189
00:10:49,106 --> 00:10:51,484
( computer beeping )

190
00:10:51,567 --> 00:10:52,902
Sir.

191
00:10:58,824 --> 00:11:00,159
-( beep )
-We're being hailed.

192
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:07,583
<i>Commander Tucker,</i>
<i>you have a poor choice of friends.</i>

193
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:11,921
An invasion?

194
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:13,297
That's correct.

195
00:11:13,381 --> 00:11:15,466
We keep a very close eye on your fleet.

196
00:11:15,549 --> 00:11:17,927
We would know if the High Command
were preparing to attack.

197
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:20,554
V'Las has been assembling ships
near Regulus,

198
00:11:20,638 --> 00:11:22,890
beyond the range
of your listening stations.

199
00:11:22,973 --> 00:11:26,060
Your leaders may be fools,
but they're not suicidal.

200
00:11:26,143 --> 00:11:28,354
They know we will respond.

201
00:11:28,437 --> 00:11:30,606
They were told
you're adapting Xindi weaponry

202
00:11:30,689 --> 00:11:32,858
and that you're planning
to use it against Vulcan.

203
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:34,151
That's absurd!

204
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:35,778
Captain Archer
destroyed the Xindi prototype

205
00:11:35,861 --> 00:11:37,363
before we could examine it.

206
00:11:37,446 --> 00:11:40,449
That fact was conveniently omitted.

207
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:43,244
You people are so used to lying,

208
00:11:43,327 --> 00:11:45,663
you don't even tell
the truth to each other!

209
00:11:45,746 --> 00:11:48,290
How do I know you weren't
sent here as a diversion?

210
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:49,917
You don't.

211
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:56,090
Do you have any idea what will happen
when the Imperial Guard retaliates?

212
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:59,510
It will be a disaster for both our worlds!

213
00:11:59,593 --> 00:12:03,514
Which is why you must convince them
to intercept our fleet.

214
00:12:05,182 --> 00:12:08,769
You're betraying your own people
by telling me this.

215
00:12:08,853 --> 00:12:11,605
-I'm aware of that.
-Why are you doing it?

216
00:12:12,606 --> 00:12:15,651
The High Command is counting
on the element of surprise.

217
00:12:15,734 --> 00:12:17,027
If they meet resistance,

218
00:12:17,111 --> 00:12:20,656
I believe V'Las will be forced
to call off the invasion.

219
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:28,289
When does this invasion begin?

220
00:12:28,747 --> 00:12:30,040
Soon.

221
00:12:30,124 --> 00:12:32,877
That's the best you can give me... Soon?

222
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:34,628
Yes.

223
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:38,382
Do you believe him, pink-skin?

224
00:12:38,466 --> 00:12:40,009
I wouldn't be here if I didn't.

225
00:12:49,768 --> 00:12:52,438
I'll need to consult with my superiors.

226
00:12:52,521 --> 00:12:54,982
I suggest you do it fast.

227
00:13:09,246 --> 00:13:11,165
T'POL: That's the fourth patrol today.

228
00:13:11,248 --> 00:13:13,876
There's an extensive security grid
around the capital.

229
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:16,086
It's unlikely we'll get past it.

230
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:18,047
We'll find a way.

231
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:19,965
Surak will help us.

232
00:13:23,177 --> 00:13:25,012
You don't believe in the Katra?

233
00:13:26,347 --> 00:13:28,098
It's irrelevant what I believe.

234
00:13:28,974 --> 00:13:32,811
The Captain could be permanently injured
if we don't get him to a doctor soon.

235
00:13:32,895 --> 00:13:35,147
He doesn't need a physician.
He needs a priest...

236
00:13:35,231 --> 00:13:37,733
One experienced with Katras.

237
00:13:41,862 --> 00:13:45,407
It's irrational that we're following
someone in his state of mind.

238
00:13:46,825 --> 00:13:49,578
What if he dies before we can get help?

239
00:13:53,123 --> 00:13:54,542
I apologize.

240
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:59,255
My mother's death has affected me
more than I realized.

241
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:02,049
It was a great loss.

242
00:14:02,132 --> 00:14:05,511
We disagreed frequently,
but I valued her counsel.

243
00:14:07,471 --> 00:14:11,183
I could allow you to experience
what she shared with me.

244
00:14:13,727 --> 00:14:15,271
You melded with her?

245
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:21,026
I cannot meld.

246
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:22,528
I would initiate it.

247
00:14:23,988 --> 00:14:25,573
That's not what I mean.

248
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:30,035
I was forced...

249
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:33,289
To participate in a meld
several years ago.

250
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:36,500
I was infected with a neural disease.

251
00:14:36,584 --> 00:14:38,335
Pa'Nar Syndrome.

252
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:41,088
Do you still suffer from it?

253
00:14:41,922 --> 00:14:43,716
There's no cure.

254
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:47,428
Another lie perpetrated
by the High Command.

255
00:14:47,511 --> 00:14:50,472
Pa'Nar has been known since Surak's time.

256
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:54,518
It's caused by melders who have
been improperly trained.

257
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:58,480
One with great experience
can correct the neurological imbalance.

258
00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:00,024
Is this something you can do?

259
00:15:10,451 --> 00:15:13,120
My mind to your mind.

260
00:15:13,203 --> 00:15:15,623
My thoughts to your thoughts.

261
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:19,376
Our minds are merging.

262
00:15:23,005 --> 00:15:24,715
Our minds are one.

263
00:15:30,638 --> 00:15:33,766
-FEMALE: <i>Bridge to Commander Shran.</i>
-This is Shran.

264
00:15:33,849 --> 00:15:37,686
<i>We've isolated the Vulcan's</i>
<i>bio-signature.</i>
<i>He's alone.</i>

265
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:40,314
You're certain <i>Enterprise</i>
won't detect the transport?

266
00:15:40,397 --> 00:15:42,316
<i>All they'll see is a brief energy surge.</i>

267
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:45,235
<i>They'll think it came from the nebula.</i>

268
00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:46,862
<i>Commander?</i>

269
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:50,240
Energize when ready.

270
00:15:50,324 --> 00:15:51,408
MALE: <i>Yes, sir.</i>

271
00:15:53,243 --> 00:15:54,453
( gasps )

272
00:15:57,289 --> 00:15:59,500
Welcome aboard, Ambassador.

273
00:16:05,422 --> 00:16:08,926
If you're expecting me to plead for mercy,
you'll be waiting a long time.

274
00:16:09,009 --> 00:16:12,012
I simply want to know
your fleet's actual location.

275
00:16:12,096 --> 00:16:13,889
I've already given it to you.

276
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:17,101
Then consider this our way of
confirming what you've told us.

277
00:16:17,893 --> 00:16:19,770
You didn't expect the Imperial Guard

278
00:16:19,853 --> 00:16:22,398
to mobilize its entire fleet
based on nothing more

279
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:25,776
than the word
of one loyal Vulcan diplomat?

280
00:16:25,859 --> 00:16:30,364
We spent weeks arguing over details
in our treaty negotiations.

281
00:16:30,447 --> 00:16:34,159
-Did I ever mislead you?
-No.

282
00:16:35,494 --> 00:16:40,124
You must know that torture
is rarely effective against Vulcans.

283
00:16:40,207 --> 00:16:43,168
Our mental disciplines
allow us to suppress pain.

284
00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:46,046
Our security division has had
a great deal of experience

285
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:49,550
extracting information
from Vulcan operatives.

286
00:16:49,633 --> 00:16:53,012
This machine doesn't
cause physical discomfort.

287
00:16:53,095 --> 00:16:58,267
It uses a neuro-synaptic field
to lower your emotional threshold.

288
00:17:04,648 --> 00:17:05,941
( groans )

289
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:07,609
How do you feel?

290
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:09,319
( gasping )

291
00:17:13,407 --> 00:17:17,870
I've seen Vulcans who were
broken by this device.

292
00:17:17,953 --> 00:17:19,788
They were never the same again.

293
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:23,167
I have no desire
to see that happen to you.

294
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:26,211
-Where is your fleet?
-I told you.

295
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:28,130
Our ships are assembling near Regulus.

296
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:32,843
( electronic whining )

297
00:17:32,926 --> 00:17:34,720
( whimpers ) Release me!

298
00:17:34,803 --> 00:17:38,182
I can't... Not until I'm certain
you've told us the truth.

299
00:17:38,265 --> 00:17:42,853
Then I suggest you increase the setting
and get this over with!

300
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:47,066
( electronic whining )

301
00:17:47,357 --> 00:17:49,318
( screaming )

302
00:17:50,527 --> 00:17:51,862
What is it?

303
00:17:51,945 --> 00:17:53,781
The Ambassador seems to be missing.

304
00:17:53,864 --> 00:17:57,534
He's not in his quarters
or anywhere on "D" deck.

305
00:17:57,618 --> 00:18:00,162
-( computer beeps )
-Tucker to Soval.

306
00:18:01,413 --> 00:18:03,540
Ambassador, please respond.

307
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:07,878
Internal sensors...
Scan for his bio-signs.

308
00:18:09,546 --> 00:18:10,881
He's not onboard.

309
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:16,720
Scan the Andorian ships.

310
00:18:18,555 --> 00:18:22,184
There's a Vulcan signature
on their lead ship.

311
00:18:22,267 --> 00:18:24,770
Go to tactical alert. Open a channel.

312
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:27,648
This is Commander Tucker.

313
00:18:27,731 --> 00:18:30,484
We know Ambassador Soval's
aboard your ship.

314
00:18:30,567 --> 00:18:33,070
I want to speak with him now.

315
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:38,909
Sir, the Andorians
are moving toward the nebula.

316
00:18:38,992 --> 00:18:41,120
Target Shran's ship. Disable the engines.

317
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:50,963
( computer beeping )

318
00:18:51,547 --> 00:18:53,006
Navigation just went offline.

319
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:55,008
It's the particle flux in the nebula.

320
00:18:55,092 --> 00:18:57,761
-It's overloading the sensors.
-I've lost them.

321
00:18:57,845 --> 00:19:00,722
Can we compensate for the flux?

322
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:02,683
It'll take a few hours.

323
00:19:02,766 --> 00:19:04,852
You have the bridge.

324
00:19:08,605 --> 00:19:10,440
( sighs )

325
00:19:11,441 --> 00:19:13,527
Captain, you need to rest.

326
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:15,154
Thanks, but I'll be fine.

327
00:19:15,237 --> 00:19:17,865
The atmosphere is thinner
than you're used to.

328
00:19:17,948 --> 00:19:20,409
If you don't stop soon, you'll collapse.

329
00:19:20,492 --> 00:19:24,163
If you need a break, T'Pol,
you should say so.

330
00:19:24,246 --> 00:19:25,581
I'm going to scout ahead.

331
00:19:34,464 --> 00:19:36,925
Have you had any more
conversations with Surak?

332
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:38,677
Not in a couple of hours.

333
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,429
( grunts )

334
00:19:40,512 --> 00:19:41,638
( chuckles )

335
00:19:41,722 --> 00:19:43,724
Something's amusing?

336
00:19:43,807 --> 00:19:47,269
Of all the people who could have
carried this Katra.

337
00:19:47,352 --> 00:19:49,521
I doubt you were Syrran's first choice.

338
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:55,444
Ever since the meld,
I've felt more... centered.

339
00:19:56,486 --> 00:19:58,614
It's hard to explain.

340
00:19:59,573 --> 00:20:01,200
My whole life,

341
00:20:01,283 --> 00:20:04,703
I've never really understood Vulcans...

342
00:20:05,537 --> 00:20:08,207
Why they work so hard
to suppress their emotions.

343
00:20:10,292 --> 00:20:12,336
Now it all seems to make sense.

344
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:15,464
Next thing you know,
I'll be taking up meditation.

345
00:20:16,089 --> 00:20:18,217
You might find it beneficial.

346
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:19,635
( chuckles )

347
00:20:20,552 --> 00:20:24,181
After we get back,
maybe you'll want to take a closer look

348
00:20:24,264 --> 00:20:25,724
at the Syrrannites' philosophy.

349
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:27,935
Why?

350
00:20:28,018 --> 00:20:30,395
( sighs ) It was important to your mother.

351
00:20:30,854 --> 00:20:32,898
There might be something to it.

352
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:38,654
There are many groups who claim to follow
the true path of Surak.

353
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:41,657
I find no evidence
that this one's any different.

354
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:44,576
I would've thought you'd be more
sympathetic to their cause.

355
00:20:45,369 --> 00:20:48,664
You never seemed too happy
with the status quo around here.

356
00:20:48,747 --> 00:20:50,958
I may have had disagreements
with the High Command,

357
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:53,919
but that doesn't mean
I'm going to join a radical faction.

358
00:20:55,128 --> 00:20:57,965
You signed up with Starfleet.

359
00:20:58,507 --> 00:21:01,718
A lot of Vulcans I've met
consider us a radical faction.

360
00:21:03,387 --> 00:21:05,847
As a scientist,

361
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:07,683
I just thought you might want
to keep an open mind about it.

362
00:21:07,766 --> 00:21:09,518
This has nothing to do with science!

363
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:11,311
Am I interrupting?

364
00:21:15,232 --> 00:21:16,358
No.

365
00:21:29,746 --> 00:21:32,082
-Let me out of here!
-I can't.

366
00:21:32,165 --> 00:21:33,959
I'm sorry. Not yet.

367
00:21:34,042 --> 00:21:36,003
I'll tear the antennae from your skull!

368
00:21:36,086 --> 00:21:39,006
If this interrogation continues,

369
00:21:39,089 --> 00:21:42,384
your suppression system
could be permanently damaged.

370
00:21:42,467 --> 00:21:43,885
Tell me what I want to know!

371
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:46,847
Aren't you enjoying this, Commander?

372
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:50,934
Have you imagined having me
in this chair many times?

373
00:21:51,018 --> 00:21:53,770
That's not far from the truth.

374
00:21:53,854 --> 00:21:58,734
But after our rather lengthy peace talks,
I came to trust you.

375
00:21:58,817 --> 00:22:00,485
Then trust me now!

376
00:22:01,111 --> 00:22:03,697
You would never betray your people!

377
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:05,699
I'm trying to save them!

378
00:22:05,782 --> 00:22:07,951
( grunting )

379
00:22:09,911 --> 00:22:12,122
Where is your fleet?

380
00:22:12,205 --> 00:22:14,583
( panting )

381
00:22:16,251 --> 00:22:18,545
Do you know the story of Nirak?

382
00:22:20,047 --> 00:22:21,173
What?

383
00:22:21,256 --> 00:22:24,843
He was a soldier
who lived a long time ago.

384
00:22:24,926 --> 00:22:29,139
He was standing watch over
the gates of the city of Gol,

385
00:22:29,598 --> 00:22:33,560
and he saw a cloud on the horizon
moving toward him.

386
00:22:33,977 --> 00:22:37,647
He thought it was a sandstorm,
so he told no one.

387
00:22:37,731 --> 00:22:40,108
It was an army.

388
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:44,863
They destroyed the city,
but they let Nirak live.

389
00:22:44,946 --> 00:22:50,994
His name now means "Fool" in our language,
just as yours will in Andorian!

390
00:22:54,581 --> 00:22:56,291
( electronic whining )

391
00:22:56,374 --> 00:22:58,794
( screaming )

392
00:23:05,425 --> 00:23:07,677
Give the Kir'Shara to us.

393
00:23:07,761 --> 00:23:09,304
You won't be injured.

394
00:23:12,182 --> 00:23:14,851
This isn't your world, human.

395
00:23:14,935 --> 00:23:16,937
( grunting )

396
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:15,662
Archer!

397
00:24:15,745 --> 00:24:18,456
Surrender and you won't be harmed.

398
00:24:19,166 --> 00:24:20,458
I'm not leaving her.

399
00:24:52,616 --> 00:24:53,742
( coughing )

400
00:24:53,825 --> 00:24:55,660
Oh.

401
00:24:55,744 --> 00:24:57,579
( panting )

402
00:25:00,332 --> 00:25:02,083
What the hell were you doing?

403
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:04,252
Protecting the Kir'Shara.

404
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:17,057
( gasps )

405
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:19,476
Where are they taking the Kir'Shara?

406
00:25:24,189 --> 00:25:27,108
-Mount Seleya.
-Why?

407
00:25:27,192 --> 00:25:31,404
Because the artifact contains
Surak's original writings.

408
00:25:31,488 --> 00:25:34,616
Only the priests on Seleya
can translate them.

409
00:25:35,533 --> 00:25:37,786
If you are deceiving me...

410
00:25:37,869 --> 00:25:40,205
I am a Syrrannite. We don't lie.

411
00:25:54,552 --> 00:25:55,845
( moans )

412
00:25:55,929 --> 00:25:58,556
( panting ) I need to rest.

413
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,767
If you're attempting to delay us,
it won't work.

414
00:26:00,850 --> 00:26:02,310
We'll find your friends.

415
00:26:11,111 --> 00:26:13,947
You've changed.

416
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:17,242
I served under you
during the Tomed mission.

417
00:26:17,325 --> 00:26:18,618
You don't remember me.

418
00:26:18,702 --> 00:26:20,370
That's a very long time ago.

419
00:26:21,329 --> 00:26:23,957
You were a fine officer then.

420
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:27,085
Why did you betray us?

421
00:26:27,669 --> 00:26:29,796
They must have offered you something.

422
00:26:30,463 --> 00:26:32,841
Or perhaps you enjoy
hiding bombs in embassies.

423
00:26:32,924 --> 00:26:34,551
We weren't responsible.

424
00:26:34,634 --> 00:26:36,970
Two of my men were killed
in the embassy explosion.

425
00:26:37,053 --> 00:26:38,930
You have been misled.

426
00:26:39,472 --> 00:26:40,932
Syrrannites are peaceful.

427
00:26:41,599 --> 00:26:44,686
I have spared your life
because you were once my superior.

428
00:26:44,769 --> 00:26:47,230
Your companions won't be so fortunate.

429
00:26:49,065 --> 00:26:52,360
-FEMALE: <i>Bridge to Commander Shran.</i>
-What is it?

430
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:54,696
<i>The general is asking for</i>
<i>an update on the interrogation.</i>

431
00:26:54,779 --> 00:26:56,614
Tell him I'll contact him when I'm ready.

432
00:26:56,698 --> 00:26:58,074
<i>Acknowledged.</i>

433
00:26:58,158 --> 00:27:00,869
( laughing )

434
00:27:01,953 --> 00:27:04,456
You find this amusing?

435
00:27:05,081 --> 00:27:09,794
Ordinarily I wouldn't,
but because of this device...

436
00:27:09,878 --> 00:27:14,132
There are three higher settings
on that panel.

437
00:27:14,716 --> 00:27:17,052
If I use them...

438
00:27:18,178 --> 00:27:20,889
You're afraid to injure me.

439
00:27:21,473 --> 00:27:25,018
If I were you, I'd leave that detail out
in your report to the general.

440
00:27:26,227 --> 00:27:28,688
Where is your fleet?

441
00:27:29,064 --> 00:27:31,441
I was a fool to think you'd listen.

442
00:27:31,983 --> 00:27:33,943
Perhaps the High Command was right.

443
00:27:34,402 --> 00:27:37,072
We'll be better off when Andoria falls.

444
00:27:37,155 --> 00:27:38,865
( explosion )

445
00:27:38,948 --> 00:27:40,158
Report!

446
00:27:40,241 --> 00:27:42,369
FEMALE: <i>It's the Starfleet ship.</i>

447
00:27:42,452 --> 00:27:43,787
Direct hit to their shield generator.

448
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:45,914
See if you can get a lock on Soval.

449
00:27:47,415 --> 00:27:49,000
FEMALE: <i>Should we return fire?</i>

450
00:27:49,084 --> 00:27:52,587
Are you going to make enemies
of the humans as well?

451
00:27:58,343 --> 00:28:01,429
Lieutenant,
order our ships out of the nebula.

452
00:28:01,513 --> 00:28:03,264
-FEMALE: <i>Commander?</i>
-And tell <i>Enterprise</i>

453
00:28:03,348 --> 00:28:05,809
we'll be returning the ambassador shortly.

454
00:28:05,892 --> 00:28:07,018
<i>Understood.</i>

455
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:09,354
Get that thing off of him.

456
00:28:17,695 --> 00:28:21,241
They're heading east,
away from the capital.

457
00:28:23,535 --> 00:28:25,161
She's with them.

458
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:30,875
-Where are you going?
-To find my science officer.

459
00:28:30,959 --> 00:28:33,545
And I don't want to hear any lectures
about the needs of the many.

460
00:28:33,628 --> 00:28:35,755
I get enough of that crap from...

461
00:28:36,631 --> 00:28:38,383
From T'Pol.

462
00:28:38,466 --> 00:28:40,635
There's no logic to your plan.

463
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:42,095
We have no weapons.

464
00:28:42,178 --> 00:28:44,806
If they take the Kir'Shara from you,
they'll destroy it.

465
00:28:44,889 --> 00:28:46,307
I'm gonna find her.

466
00:29:04,117 --> 00:29:05,243
How is he?

467
00:29:05,326 --> 00:29:07,454
You've got a lot of nerve
pretending you give a damn.

468
00:29:07,537 --> 00:29:09,831
I did what was necessary.

469
00:29:10,999 --> 00:29:12,667
Soval would understand.

470
00:29:13,334 --> 00:29:15,587
He should be fine in another day or so.

471
00:29:15,670 --> 00:29:17,589
He risked his life coming here.

472
00:29:17,672 --> 00:29:19,799
And you paid him back
by scrambling his neurons.

473
00:29:19,883 --> 00:29:22,552
He is not the only one taking a risk.

474
00:29:22,635 --> 00:29:25,388
I just spoke with the Imperial Guard.

475
00:29:25,472 --> 00:29:28,099
They're redeploying our forces.

476
00:29:29,058 --> 00:29:30,852
Now you believe him.

477
00:29:30,935 --> 00:29:32,312
What changed your mind?

478
00:29:34,105 --> 00:29:36,149
A lesser man would have told me

479
00:29:36,232 --> 00:29:38,526
what I wanted to hear,
even if it wasn't true.

480
00:29:39,402 --> 00:29:45,366
There's been too much suspicion,
too many lies, on both sides.

481
00:29:48,369 --> 00:29:52,081
Our fleet will intercept the Vulcans
at these coordinates.

482
00:29:52,165 --> 00:29:58,421
My superiors believe it may be...
helpful if <i>Enterprise </i>were to join us.

483
00:30:04,135 --> 00:30:06,054
( screeching )

484
00:30:06,137 --> 00:30:07,680
Sehlat.

485
00:30:11,267 --> 00:30:14,020
( imitating screeching )

486
00:30:18,066 --> 00:30:19,442
( groaning )

487
00:30:36,125 --> 00:30:38,920
My First Officer... Where is she?

488
00:30:43,174 --> 00:30:44,551
What have you done with her?

489
00:30:45,593 --> 00:30:49,013
She's been taken to the High Command.

490
00:30:59,232 --> 00:31:01,568
Your technique has improved.

491
00:31:08,575 --> 00:31:12,036
Welcome home, Subcommander.

492
00:31:13,705 --> 00:31:15,498
I no longer hold that rank.

493
00:31:15,582 --> 00:31:17,208
Well, you may have joined Starfleet,

494
00:31:17,292 --> 00:31:21,254
but you're still Vulcan
and subject to our laws.

495
00:31:22,338 --> 00:31:26,050
There are few crimes
still punishable by execution,

496
00:31:26,134 --> 00:31:28,469
but treason is one of them.

497
00:31:28,553 --> 00:31:30,722
( computer beeping )

498
00:31:30,805 --> 00:31:32,140
What is it?

499
00:31:32,223 --> 00:31:36,603
Seven alien ships have taken position
outside the Andorian system.

500
00:31:36,686 --> 00:31:39,314
They're directly in the path of our fleet.

501
00:31:46,154 --> 00:31:49,157
Are you sure this is wise?
If the Vulcans find us here,

502
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:50,825
they might think we're siding
with the Andorians.

503
00:31:50,909 --> 00:31:53,077
There's no guarantee
they won't fire on us.

504
00:31:53,161 --> 00:31:56,456
Sir, I'm reading a massive
subspace distortion.

505
00:31:56,539 --> 00:31:57,749
Hoshi?

506
00:31:57,832 --> 00:31:59,876
It's the Vulcans.
They'll be here in two hours.

507
00:31:59,959 --> 00:32:01,127
( computer beeping )

508
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:02,295
He's hailing us again.

509
00:32:02,378 --> 00:32:03,588
On screen.

510
00:32:05,089 --> 00:32:08,635
<i>Our sensors show</i>
<i>12 Vulcan cruisers approaching.</i>

511
00:32:08,718 --> 00:32:10,428
When will the rest of your fleet get here?

512
00:32:10,511 --> 00:32:13,556
<i>They won't arrive in time.</i>
<i>We're on our own.</i>

513
00:32:20,855 --> 00:32:24,943
ARCHER: I'm still not clear
how the Kir'Shara is gonna stop a war.

514
00:32:25,026 --> 00:32:27,737
V'Las can't govern without
approval from the Council.

515
00:32:28,321 --> 00:32:29,989
The existence of the Kir'Shara

516
00:32:30,073 --> 00:32:33,201
will persuade them
to reconsider their support.

517
00:32:37,497 --> 00:32:41,542
I don't suppose they'll let us
just walk into the High Command.

518
00:32:41,626 --> 00:32:44,671
We can transport in,
but we'll need access codes.

519
00:32:46,923 --> 00:32:48,633
I know someone who might have them.

520
00:33:00,103 --> 00:33:01,437
The Vulcans are powering weapons.

521
00:33:01,521 --> 00:33:03,022
The Andorians are doing the same.

522
00:33:03,106 --> 00:33:05,358
Travis, put us between both fleets.

523
00:33:05,441 --> 00:33:07,485
If the Vulcans want to start a war,

524
00:33:07,568 --> 00:33:10,446
they're gonna
have to get through us first.

525
00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:13,074
-( computer beeps )
-It's Shran.

526
00:33:14,993 --> 00:33:16,703
SHRAN: <i>Commander,</i>
<i>what do you think you're doing?</i>

527
00:33:16,786 --> 00:33:19,288
In case you hadn't noticed,
they outnumber us two to one!

528
00:33:19,372 --> 00:33:22,417
<i>-Get back in formation.</i>
-I'm trying to buy us some time!

529
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:30,883
The Andorians have more ships on the way.

530
00:33:30,967 --> 00:33:32,802
They won't arrive for several hours.

531
00:33:32,885 --> 00:33:36,097
You told us this strike
would be a surprise,

532
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:39,517
that there would be minimal
casualties on both sides.

533
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:43,271
The Andorians are armed
with standard particle cannons.

534
00:33:43,354 --> 00:33:47,608
There is no evidence of Xindi technology.

535
00:33:47,692 --> 00:33:51,320
Administrator,
we have to call off this attack.

536
00:33:53,197 --> 00:33:55,241
Our forces are committed.

537
00:33:55,324 --> 00:33:57,452
-We can't turn back.
-( computer beeps )

538
00:33:57,535 --> 00:33:59,537
MALE: <i>We're being hailed</i>
<i>by the Starfleet ship.</i>

539
00:34:01,456 --> 00:34:04,500
<i>This is Commander Tucker.</i>
<i>Sorry to spoil your surprise,</i>

540
00:34:04,584 --> 00:34:06,836
<i>but the Andorians know</i>
<i>what you're planning.</i>

541
00:34:06,919 --> 00:34:09,338
I suggest you turn your ships around now.

542
00:34:09,422 --> 00:34:13,384
This doesn't concern Starfleet.
Leave the area immediately.

543
00:34:13,468 --> 00:34:14,969
I can't do that.

544
00:34:15,053 --> 00:34:16,929
The Andorians helped us
when Earth was under attack.

545
00:34:17,013 --> 00:34:18,723
We're just here to return the favor.

546
00:34:19,015 --> 00:34:21,934
If you side with the Andorians,
you'll be fired upon.

547
00:34:22,018 --> 00:34:24,353
<i>I've already sent word</i>
<i>to Admiral Gardner.</i>

548
00:34:24,437 --> 00:34:28,649
<i>If </i>Enterprise <i>is destroyed,</i>
<i>Starfleet's gonna know who is responsible.</i>

549
00:34:30,234 --> 00:34:34,280
Order our ships to engage the enemy fleet.

550
00:34:34,363 --> 00:34:37,617
Administrator, I can't allow this.

551
00:34:38,326 --> 00:34:40,495
Sublieutenant.

552
00:34:40,578 --> 00:34:43,748
If you attempt to interfere again...

553
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:46,793
I'll have you arrested.

554
00:34:50,254 --> 00:34:51,589
( computer beeping )

555
00:34:51,672 --> 00:34:53,800
The Vulcans... They're locking weapons.

556
00:34:53,883 --> 00:34:55,093
On us?

557
00:34:55,176 --> 00:34:58,387
-No. Just the Andorians.
-Stand by phase cannons.

558
00:34:58,471 --> 00:35:00,098
Don't fire until I give the order.

559
00:35:13,402 --> 00:35:14,946
We're in the crossfire!

560
00:35:15,029 --> 00:35:17,156
Hard about.
Get us out of their weapons range.

561
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:20,201
One of the Andorian ships is in trouble.
Their reactor's been hit.

562
00:35:20,284 --> 00:35:21,786
A Vulcan cruiser's heading towards them.

563
00:35:21,869 --> 00:35:23,538
See if you can get their attention.

564
00:35:25,414 --> 00:35:28,042
MALE: <i>The Earth vessel's opened fire</i>
<i>on one of our ships.</i>

565
00:35:28,126 --> 00:35:29,836
Destroy them.

566
00:35:29,919 --> 00:35:31,879
The cruiser's breaking off its attack.

567
00:35:31,963 --> 00:35:33,506
-We're being targeted.
-( explosion )

568
00:35:33,589 --> 00:35:36,384
Evasive starboard. Full impulse.

569
00:35:36,467 --> 00:35:37,426
Malcolm!

570
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:39,679
We're not making a dent in their shields.

571
00:35:48,604 --> 00:35:50,898
-( computer beeps )
-Shran's hailing.

572
00:35:54,735 --> 00:35:57,363
<i>Tell Archer that's two he owes me!</i>

573
00:36:13,504 --> 00:36:14,839
Contact security!

574
00:36:14,922 --> 00:36:18,593
Stay where you are.
We need to have a talk.

575
00:36:18,676 --> 00:36:22,013
Administrator,
it is agreeable to see you again.

576
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:26,726
This woman is an anarchist, Captain.

577
00:36:27,727 --> 00:36:30,438
Whatever she's told you isn't the truth.

578
00:36:30,521 --> 00:36:33,357
T'Pau didn't bomb our embassy.

579
00:36:34,984 --> 00:36:36,194
You did.

580
00:36:37,111 --> 00:36:39,405
The evidence is conclusive.

581
00:36:39,488 --> 00:36:41,824
Evidence your people gave us.

582
00:36:41,908 --> 00:36:46,245
The bombing was an excuse
to round up the Syrrannites,

583
00:36:46,329 --> 00:36:49,540
to make certain they'd never find this.

584
00:36:57,089 --> 00:36:58,633
Is that...

585
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:01,093
The Kir'Shara is a myth!

586
00:37:27,787 --> 00:37:29,747
-Hull plating's gone!
-Torpedoes!

587
00:37:29,830 --> 00:37:31,374
The launchers aren't responding.

588
00:37:31,457 --> 00:37:33,000
Where the hell is Shran?

589
00:37:33,084 --> 00:37:34,543
The Vulcans are keeping him busy.

590
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:38,172
Looks like we really are on our own.

591
00:37:38,673 --> 00:37:42,176
Holographic trickery. This proves nothing.

592
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:45,012
The artifact must be examined in detail.

593
00:37:45,638 --> 00:37:46,722
No.

594
00:37:46,806 --> 00:37:49,600
Quantum dating will confirm that
it's from the time of Surak.

595
00:37:49,934 --> 00:37:51,477
You can't trust her!

596
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:54,355
She'd do anything
to spread her deviant beliefs.

597
00:37:54,438 --> 00:37:56,399
You've spent years trying to subvert me.

598
00:37:56,482 --> 00:37:58,734
The Kir'Shara will show us our true path.

599
00:37:58,818 --> 00:38:01,904
They'd kill us all if they had the chance!

600
00:38:01,988 --> 00:38:03,990
It must be destroyed!

601
00:38:09,537 --> 00:38:11,539
This is Minister Kuvak.

602
00:38:11,622 --> 00:38:14,083
Get me the Fleet Commander immediately.

603
00:38:14,166 --> 00:38:17,003
( alarm blares )

604
00:38:17,086 --> 00:38:19,130
I've lost helm control.

605
00:38:19,213 --> 00:38:22,508
Hull breach on "G" deck.
We're venting atmosphere.

606
00:38:30,474 --> 00:38:33,311
The Vulcan ships... They're withdrawing.

607
00:38:33,394 --> 00:38:35,271
( computer beeps )

608
00:38:35,354 --> 00:38:38,024
We're being hailed. It's the High Command.

609
00:38:40,609 --> 00:38:43,863
ARCHER: <i>Trip, is everything all right?</i>

610
00:38:43,946 --> 00:38:46,032
More or less.

611
00:38:46,115 --> 00:38:48,117
What's going on, Captain?

612
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:50,244
<i>There have been a few changes here.</i>

613
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:52,371
<i>Get back to Vulcan as soon as you can.</i>

614
00:38:54,707 --> 00:38:56,959
ARCHER: <i>Captain's starlog, supplemental.</i>

615
00:38:57,043 --> 00:39:00,296
<i>Administrator V'Las has been</i>
<i>relieved of his position.</i>

616
00:39:00,379 --> 00:39:03,466
<i>His role in the embassy bombing</i>
<i>is being investigated.</i>

617
00:39:03,549 --> 00:39:06,969
<i>For the moment,</i>
<i>the conflict between Vulcan and Andoria</i>

618
00:39:07,053 --> 00:39:08,846
<i>appears to have been averted.</i>

619
00:39:09,930 --> 00:39:11,265
T'POL: <i>Enter.</i>

620
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:17,396
Captain Archer asked me
to express his gratitude.

621
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:20,483
He wouldn't have succeeded
without your transporter codes.

622
00:39:20,566 --> 00:39:23,611
The Captain told me you were in danger.

623
00:39:23,694 --> 00:39:26,155
I wouldn't have been
a very good husband if I didn't help.

624
00:39:26,906 --> 00:39:29,700
I'm not certain
when I'll be able to return.

625
00:39:30,326 --> 00:39:33,913
I'm aware that I promised your family
that we would eventually live together.

626
00:39:33,996 --> 00:39:35,748
That's not why I've come.

627
00:39:35,831 --> 00:39:38,876
I'm releasing you from our marriage.

628
00:39:38,959 --> 00:39:42,588
I know you only bonded with me
to help your mother.

629
00:39:43,214 --> 00:39:44,757
She's gone now.

630
00:39:45,549 --> 00:39:47,343
There's no reason for us to continue.

631
00:39:48,844 --> 00:39:50,471
You don't have to do this.

632
00:39:50,554 --> 00:39:51,597
I know.

633
00:39:56,394 --> 00:39:57,353
Koss.

634
00:40:00,856 --> 00:40:01,941
Goodbye, T'Pol.

635
00:40:22,086 --> 00:40:24,213
The Katra is with me now.

636
00:40:26,382 --> 00:40:27,675
How do you feel, Captain?

637
00:40:32,138 --> 00:40:33,889
Like a giant weight's been lifted.

638
00:40:34,265 --> 00:40:37,017
Word has already spread of the discovery.

639
00:40:37,101 --> 00:40:40,396
It may take years
to translate all of the writings.

640
00:40:40,479 --> 00:40:43,315
The people of Vulcan are in your debt.

641
00:40:44,775 --> 00:40:47,987
Peace and long life.

642
00:40:53,117 --> 00:40:55,578
You may be witnessing
the start of a new era,

643
00:40:55,661 --> 00:40:58,706
Not only for Vulcan,
but for Earth as well.

644
00:40:58,789 --> 00:41:00,583
The Minister intends to pursue

645
00:41:00,666 --> 00:41:03,002
a less aggressive policy
toward your people.

646
00:41:03,085 --> 00:41:05,588
The High Command will be dissolved.

647
00:41:05,671 --> 00:41:07,798
You'll no longer have us
looking over your shoulder.

648
00:41:07,882 --> 00:41:10,718
It's time for Earth to stand on its own.

649
00:41:11,302 --> 00:41:12,595
We're ready.

650
00:41:19,727 --> 00:41:21,395
You've failed!

651
00:41:21,479 --> 00:41:23,564
Decades of work have been lost.

652
00:41:23,647 --> 00:41:25,941
MALE: Am I to be blamed
for your incompetence?

653
00:41:26,025 --> 00:41:27,401
Archer should have been killed!

654
00:41:27,485 --> 00:41:29,904
You brought the humans into this.

655
00:41:29,987 --> 00:41:31,155
I must leave Vulcan.

656
00:41:31,238 --> 00:41:33,115
My position here has been compromised.

657
00:41:33,199 --> 00:41:34,366
What about me?

658
00:41:34,450 --> 00:41:35,951
Not now.

659
00:41:36,035 --> 00:41:38,704
Your disappearance would cause suspicion.

660
00:41:39,163 --> 00:41:41,373
This is simply a minor delay.

661
00:41:41,457 --> 00:41:44,960
The reunification of our people
is only a matter of time.
