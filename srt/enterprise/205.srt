00:38:41,278 --> 00:38:43,905
DID HE TELL YOU
THEY GAVE US TWO SPARES

694
00:38:43,947 --> 00:38:46,532
OUT OF THE KINDNESS
OF THEIR HEARTS?

695
00:38:46,574 --> 00:38:48,827
EVIDENTLY,
THE FINESSE YOU EXHIBITED

696
00:38:48,868 --> 00:38:51,871
OUTSIDE THE HALL OF DIPLOMACY
WAS APPRECIATED.

697
00:38:51,913 --> 00:38:53,706
SINCE I'VE BEEN GETTING

698
00:38:53,748 --> 00:38:58,377
SO MUCH PRACTICE
GIVING APOLOGIES, I...

699
00:38:58,419 --> 00:39:00,338
THOUGHT I MIGHT GIVE YOU ONE.

700
00:39:00,379 --> 00:39:02,299
THAT'S NOT NECESSARY.

701
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:04,383
YEAH, IT IS.

702
00:39:05,802 --> 00:39:08,763
I'VE BEEN UNDER
A LOT OF STRESS...LATELY.

703
00:39:08,805 --> 00:39:11,057
I HAVEN'T GOTTEN MUCH SLEEP.

704
00:39:11,099 --> 00:39:12,433
MY DOG...

705
00:39:12,475 --> 00:39:15,561
THERE'S NO NEED TO APOLOGIZE.

706
00:39:15,603 --> 00:39:19,983
WHATEVER FRICTION
THERE'S BEEN BETWEEN US,

707
00:39:20,025 --> 00:39:21,901
I'D LIKE TO TRY TO MINIMIZE IT.

708
00:39:21,943 --> 00:39:23,653
FRICTION IS TO BE EXPECTED

709
00:39:23,695 --> 00:39:26,364
WHENEVER PEOPLE WORK
IN CLOSE QUARTERS

710
00:39:26,405 --> 00:39:28,658
FOR EXTENDED PERIODS OF TIME.

711
00:39:30,368 --> 00:39:32,829
I GUESS THAT'S ALWAYS BEEN TRUE.

712
00:39:32,871 --> 00:39:36,374
ESPECIALLY WHEN THE PEOPLE...

713
00:39:36,415 --> 00:39:38,751
ARE OF THE OPPOSITE SEX.

714
00:39:38,793 --> 00:39:42,088
THEN IT'S GOOD
THAT YOU'RE MY SUPERIOR OFFICER,

715
00:39:42,130 --> 00:39:45,008
THAT WE'RE NOT IN A POSITION
TO ALLOW OURSELVES

716
00:39:45,050 --> 00:39:50,055
TO BECOME ATTRACTED TO ONE
ANOTHER...HYPOTHETICALLY.

717
00:39:50,096 --> 00:39:54,517
IF WE WERE, THE FRICTION
THAT YOU SPEAK OF

718
00:39:54,559 --> 00:39:58,396
COULD BE MUCH MORE...
PROBLEMATIC.

719
00:40:21,586 --> 00:40:24,422
NO APOLOGIES, CAPTAIN.

720
00:40:24,463 --> 00:40:26,216
ARCHER: I PROMISE.

721
00:40:26,258 --> 00:40:30,678
I HEAR THINGS WENT VERY WELL
ON THE SURFACE.

722
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:33,014
I DOUBT I WOULD HAVE
EVEN GONE DOWN THERE

723
00:40:33,056 --> 00:40:34,807
IF IT HADN'T BEEN FOR YOU, DOC.

724
00:40:37,185 --> 00:40:39,354
I OWE YOU ONE.

725
00:40:40,897 --> 00:40:43,149
YOU'LL BE PLEASED TO KNOW THAT,
WHILE YOU WERE GONE,

726
00:40:43,191 --> 00:40:44,776
THINGS WENT VERY WELL
UP HERE, TOO.

727
00:40:44,817 --> 00:40:45,902
THE TRANSPLANT?

728
00:40:45,944 --> 00:40:48,446
NOT THE SLIGHTEST SIGN
OF REJECTION.

729
00:40:48,487 --> 00:40:49,447
CAN I SEE HIM?

730
00:40:49,488 --> 00:40:51,408
BY ALL MEANS.

731
00:40:57,496 --> 00:40:59,207
HEY.

732
00:41:02,377 --> 00:41:05,297
IT'S BEEN ONE HELL
OF A NIGHT, HASN'T IT?

733
00:41:07,424 --> 00:41:08,967
HOW SOON CAN HE LEAVE?

734
00:41:09,008 --> 00:41:10,802
NOW'S AS GOOD A TIME AS ANY.

735
00:41:10,843 --> 00:41:12,845
ARCHER: BUT HE'S --
PHLOX: UNCONSCIOUS?

736
00:41:12,887 --> 00:41:16,308
NONSENSE.
HE'S JUST ASLEEP.

737
00:41:16,349 --> 00:41:19,102
PHLOX: PORTHOS.
[ TAPPING ]

738
00:41:21,604 --> 00:41:23,481
COME ON, BOY.

739
00:41:23,522 --> 00:41:24,857
YEAH.

740
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:29,737
WE'RE GOING HOME.

741
00:41:39,497 --> 00:41:41,624
SICK BAY'S ALL YOURS.

742
00:41:41,666 --> 00:41:46,379
YOU'RE WELCOME BACK ANYTIME,
CAPTAIN.
