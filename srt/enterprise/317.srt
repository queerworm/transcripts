00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:01,149
I PROBABLY WOULD HAVE.

689
00:40:01,149 --> 00:40:02,567

00:40:13,661 --> 00:40:14,913
UGH.

693
00:40:17,498 --> 00:40:19,376
DIDN'T MEAN TO WAKE YOU, SIR.

694
00:40:19,376 --> 00:40:22,087
IT'S ALL RIGHT.
I WAS GETTING UP ANYWAY.

695
00:40:22,087 --> 00:40:23,880
HOW ARE YOU FEELING?

696
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:26,674
OH, I'VE BEEN BETTER.

697
00:40:26,674 --> 00:40:28,968
YOU SURE YOU HAD THAT PISTOL
SET TO STUN?

[ SIGHS ] CAPTAIN.

699

I HOPE YOU UNDERSTAND IF THERE'D
BEEN ANY OTHER WAY --

700
00:40:37,018 --> 00:40:39,687
YOU WERE PROTECTING
OUR MISSION, TRIP.

701
00:40:39,687 --> 00:40:41,731
I WOULD HAVE DONE
THE SAME THING.

702
00:40:41,731 --> 00:40:45,777
STILL, I NEVER THOUGHT I'D FIND
MYSELF POINTING A WEAPON AT YOU,

703
00:40:45,777 --> 00:40:48,238
NO MATTER
WHAT THE CIRCUMSTANCES.

LET'S PUT THIS BEHIND US, OKAY?

705
00:40:51,991 --> 00:40:53,201
YES, SIR.

706
00:40:55,078 --> 00:40:56,871
WHAT'S OUR STATUS?

707
00:40:56,871 --> 00:40:59,457
WE JUST RECOVERED THE LAST
OF OUR ANTIMATTER RESERVES.

708
00:41:01,084 --> 00:41:02,961
THE HATCHLINGS?

709
00:41:02,961 --> 00:41:07,132

IT'S TIME WE GOT BACK
ON THE ROAD.

713
00:41:14,722 --> 00:41:16,391
I WANT YOU AT YOUR POST.

714
00:41:16,391 --> 00:41:19,144
WE'RE GONNA BE PUSHING
THE ENGINES PRETTY HARD.

AREN'T YOU SUPPOSED
TO GET SOME REST?

00:41:25,108 --> 00:41:28,403
I'M SORRY, SIR, BUT THE DOCTOR
WAS INSISTENT.
