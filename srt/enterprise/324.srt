1
00:00:01,835 --> 00:00:03,586
T'POL: <i>Previously on </i>Enterprise...

2
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:05,005
I've located Ensign Sato.

3
00:00:05,088 --> 00:00:07,215
<i>She's onboard one</i>
<i>of the Reptilian vessels.</i>

4
00:00:07,298 --> 00:00:08,466
( screaming )

5
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:10,135
The third launch code.

6
00:00:10,218 --> 00:00:12,095
We have complete access.

7
00:00:14,597 --> 00:00:15,807
( groans )

8
00:00:19,686 --> 00:00:22,605
The guardians will not let us fail.

9
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:24,607
The power readings from
the weapon are increasing.

10
00:00:24,691 --> 00:00:25,984
They're preparing to launch.

11
00:00:26,067 --> 00:00:29,404
Open a vortex. Set a course for Earth.

12
00:00:31,281 --> 00:00:33,867
The Captain wants
to take a team aboard to destroy it.

13
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:35,493
I need three volunteers.

14
00:00:35,577 --> 00:00:37,370
She's undergone a severe neural trauma.

15
00:00:37,454 --> 00:00:39,622
She's been inside the weapon.
I have to know what she saw.

16
00:00:39,706 --> 00:00:41,750
Have her taken aboard
Degra's ship right away.

17
00:00:43,418 --> 00:00:44,919
MAN: <i>The Aquatics joined us</i>

18
00:00:45,003 --> 00:00:48,173
only because you promised
to neutralize the spheres.

19
00:00:48,256 --> 00:00:51,009
We have a plan to disable Sphere 41.

20
00:00:51,092 --> 00:00:53,553
If we're right,
it should disrupt the entire network.

21
00:00:53,636 --> 00:00:59,017
Reptilians will preside
over a stronger, unified Xindi empire

22
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:02,145
if humankind is eradicated.

23
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:14,032
If they had made us
the dominant species before the wars,

24
00:01:14,115 --> 00:01:16,326
our homeworld would still exist.

25
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:19,245
And our avian brothers
would still fill the skies.

26
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:25,251
We should be grateful that the guardians
have finally come to their senses.

27
00:01:25,335 --> 00:01:27,337
Once Earth is destroyed,

28
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:30,673
the reptilians
will take their rightful place

29
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:34,302
at the head of a new Xindi empire.

30
00:01:34,385 --> 00:01:36,471

They're nearly three hours ahead of us,
but this vessel is faster.

00:03:08,438 --> 00:03:09,772
We're closing the gap.

53
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:11,858
It may be faster, but it's not well-armed.

54
00:03:11,941 --> 00:03:13,693
How many ships are escorting the weapon?

55
00:03:13,776 --> 00:03:16,029
I can't tell.

56
00:03:16,112 --> 00:03:18,406
{\an8}The only way we're going to be
able to destroy this thing

57
00:03:18,489 --> 00:03:19,991
{\an8}is from inside.

58
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:26,581
{\an8}Any luck?

59
00:03:26,664 --> 00:03:29,667
{\an8}All of Degra's schematics are encrypted.

60
00:03:29,751 --> 00:03:31,794
We're gonna need Hoshi to help us.

61
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:33,338
She's in no condition to come up here.

62
00:03:33,421 --> 00:03:34,839
I wish I had a choice, Malcolm.

63
00:03:34,923 --> 00:03:36,341
Sir, she's barely conscious.

64
00:03:40,345 --> 00:03:42,597
{\an8}Can you transfer that to a PADD?

65
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,057
{\an8}Something portable?

66
00:03:46,476 --> 00:03:49,854
The favorable timelines
continue to diminish.

67
00:03:49,938 --> 00:03:52,899
They should be increasing.

68
00:03:52,982 --> 00:03:55,985
The weapon has almost reached its target.

69
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:59,364
But the Earth ship is on course
for our primary sphere.

70
00:03:59,447 --> 00:04:02,200
Accelerate the transformation
around that sphere.

71
00:04:02,283 --> 00:04:04,369
They mustn't be allowed to intervene.

72
00:04:08,831 --> 00:04:10,166
Report.

73
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,918
We've realigned the main power grid.

74
00:04:12,001 --> 00:04:15,463
{\an8}It should increase the deflector
pulse threefold, maybe four.

75
00:04:15,546 --> 00:04:19,467
{\an8}But it's gonna fry just about
every system onboard.

76
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:22,262
{\an8}Be prepared to initiate
the pulse within two hours.

77
00:04:22,345 --> 00:04:24,722
{\an8}I don't think you heard what I just said.

78
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:27,642
{\an8}We try this, and the ship's
gonna come apart at the seams.

79
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:32,689
{\an8}Two hours, Mr. Tucker.

80
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:36,359
{\an8}The Captain told the Xindi
we'd try to knock these things out.

81
00:04:36,442 --> 00:04:38,778
{\an8}He didn't say anything about
demolishing <i>Enterprise </i>in the process.

82
00:04:38,861 --> 00:04:40,238
{\an8}Has it occurred to you
what's going to happen

83
00:04:40,321 --> 00:04:43,241
{\an8}if Captain Archer fails,
if Earth is destroyed?

84
00:04:43,324 --> 00:04:45,410
-Every day.
-Good.

85
00:04:45,493 --> 00:04:48,705
Then you've already come to the conclusion
that without humanity,

86
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:51,457
there's no one to combat
these sphere builders.

87
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:53,543
Their expanse will continue to grow,

88
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:58,464
encompassing one system after another,
including Vulcan.

89
00:04:58,548 --> 00:05:01,342
Your world is no longer
the only one in jeopardy.

90
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:04,554
Two hours.

91
00:05:08,933 --> 00:05:10,768
( sighs )

92
00:05:10,852 --> 00:05:13,187
( computer beeping )

93
00:05:13,271 --> 00:05:14,605
I think we've got a problem.

94
00:05:14,689 --> 00:05:15,773
What is it?

95
00:05:15,857 --> 00:05:18,109
Sphere 41.

96
00:05:18,192 --> 00:05:19,736
Are you certain these are the coordinates?

97
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:21,237
Yep.

98
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:24,574
There shouldn't be anything on sensors,
not with the cloaking barrier.

99
00:05:24,657 --> 00:05:26,909
But there it is and it's getting bigger.

100
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:28,911
Have you analyzed it?

101
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:30,371
Could be spatial anomalies,

102
00:05:30,455 --> 00:05:33,207
but they're clustered much tighter
than we've ever seen them.

103
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:38,212
{\an8}PHLOX: They're transforming the space
surrounding that sphere,

104
00:05:38,296 --> 00:05:39,672
{\an8}not unlike the disturbance

105
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:41,340
{\an8}where we found
the trans-dimensional being.

106
00:05:41,424 --> 00:05:43,009
{\an8}They're obviously expecting us.

107
00:05:43,092 --> 00:05:44,719
{\an8}If we're going to disable the network,

108
00:05:44,802 --> 00:05:46,846
{\an8}we'll need to get within
a kilometer of the surface.

109
00:05:46,929 --> 00:05:48,264
{\an8}If the ship were to enter
that disturbance,

110
00:05:48,347 --> 00:05:51,559
{\an8}the entire crew would be dead
within minutes.

111
00:05:51,642 --> 00:05:55,188
{\an8}I could synthesize a neuroleptic compound

112
00:05:55,271 --> 00:05:58,357
{\an8}that would keep us conscious
for approximately 12 minutes.

113
00:05:58,441 --> 00:06:02,528
{\an8}I'm afraid there's nothing I can do
to prevent epidermal decay.

114
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:05,281
{\an8}Twelve minutes won't be enough.

115
00:06:05,364 --> 00:06:07,366
{\an8}Perhaps I can extend it, but not by much.

116
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:09,535
{\an8}I encourage you and Mr. Tucker
to consider alternatives.

117
00:06:09,619 --> 00:06:13,331
{\an8}There must be something
you can do to abbreviate your plan.

118
00:06:19,378 --> 00:06:20,755
Any luck?

119
00:06:22,757 --> 00:06:24,092
Ensign?

120
00:06:28,096 --> 00:06:30,181
I'm not feeling very well.

121
00:06:31,265 --> 00:06:34,227
Do you think you can get Phlox
to come down here?

122
00:06:35,937 --> 00:06:38,272
We're on Degra's ship, Hoshi.

123
00:06:38,356 --> 00:06:39,690
Phlox isn't here.

124
00:06:39,774 --> 00:06:42,151
I'm not sure what
I'm supposed to be doing.

125
00:06:45,196 --> 00:06:47,740
The schematics for the weapon.

126
00:06:47,824 --> 00:06:49,951
Degra encrypted them before he was killed.

127
00:06:50,034 --> 00:06:52,036
You've been trying to decipher them.

128
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:55,039
I gave them the third code.

129
00:06:55,123 --> 00:06:57,208
They wouldn't have
been able to arm the weapon

130
00:06:57,291 --> 00:06:59,043
if I hadn't given them the third code.

131
00:06:59,127 --> 00:07:01,212
You were drugged, Hoshi.
You had no choice.

132
00:07:01,295 --> 00:07:03,673
I did. I should have fought harder.

133
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:11,180
You need to finish what you're doing.

134
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:12,765
You're almost there.

135
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:20,022
We're gonna board the weapon,
try to overload the power systems.

136
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:23,025
But we can't do that
until we can read these schematics.

137
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:24,986
I tried to jump but I wasn't fast enough.

138
00:07:25,069 --> 00:07:26,737
You need to finish this.

139
00:07:26,821 --> 00:07:29,490
You got the three codes,
so why don't you just kill me?

140
00:07:29,574 --> 00:07:31,492
Didn't you say you were gonna kill me?

141
00:07:31,576 --> 00:07:35,830
You got to pull yourself together
just for a little while longer.

142
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:45,089
You need to complete the decryption.

143
00:07:47,758 --> 00:07:50,678
Everything hinges on it.

144
00:07:50,761 --> 00:07:52,013
Do you understand?

145
00:07:55,099 --> 00:07:56,517
I understand.

146
00:08:03,065 --> 00:08:06,068
When we exit the vortex,
how close will we be?

147
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:08,237
Approximately two million kilometers
from Earth.

148
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:09,405
Two million?

149
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:10,990
If we had all five codes,

150
00:08:11,073 --> 00:08:12,950
we could begin that
firing sequence immediately.

151
00:08:13,034 --> 00:08:15,786
But with three,
we'll need additional time.

152
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:17,330
We'd be vulnerable if we dropped

153
00:08:17,413 --> 00:08:19,540
into normal space
any closer to the target.

154
00:08:19,624 --> 00:08:23,753
Do whatever it takes
to fire the weapon as quickly as possible.

155
00:08:30,801 --> 00:08:32,345
You wanted to see me, sir?

156
00:08:32,428 --> 00:08:34,013
I think I found a way to boost
the deflector pulse

157
00:08:34,096 --> 00:08:36,015
without tearing the ship apart.

158
00:08:36,098 --> 00:08:39,685
But it's gonna mean transferring
all impulse power to the array.

159
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:40,770
When?

160
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:42,146
As soon as we reach the sphere.

161
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:43,147
Sir.

162
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:44,732
Sorry, Travis.

163
00:08:44,815 --> 00:08:47,276
You're gonna have to get us
to the manifold on thrusters only.

164
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,530
That's tying my hands, Commander,
especially with a ticking clock.

165
00:08:50,613 --> 00:08:52,782
You can do it.

166
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:54,700
Look over these schematics.

167
00:08:54,784 --> 00:08:57,286
Familiarize yourself with
the surface features of the sphere.

168
00:08:58,329 --> 00:09:01,582
We won't be out to transport directly
onto the control platform.

169
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:03,793
It's too heavily shielded.

170
00:09:03,876 --> 00:09:07,672
We'll have to beam in and out
no deeper than this peripheral framework.

171
00:09:07,755 --> 00:09:09,257
What if you need to board the weapon

172
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:12,552
before your crewman
completes her decryptions?

173
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:16,806
I'm taking her with me.

174
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:20,393
-Sir, she's hardly in any shape--
-She's been there, Malcolm.

175
00:09:20,476 --> 00:09:22,478
That's where she deciphered
the third launch code.

176
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:23,980
She was drugged.

177
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:25,731
There's no reason to believe that
she'll remember anything--

178
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:27,358
ARCHER: She's coming with me.

179
00:09:28,484 --> 00:09:31,445
I want you and your team
to beam in right before we do.

180
00:09:31,529 --> 00:09:35,241
Secure the closest route to the platform.

181
00:09:35,324 --> 00:09:37,868
If you succeed in creating the overload,

182
00:09:37,952 --> 00:09:40,580
what makes you think you'll be
able to get out in time?

183
00:09:40,663 --> 00:09:44,166
I'll give everyone a chance
to get to the outer framework.

184
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,669
You'll be in charge of helping Hoshi.

185
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:47,962
And you, sir?

186
00:09:49,672 --> 00:09:52,049
I have no plans of dying
on that weapon, Malcolm.

187
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:55,803
I'm gonna see
what else she's come up with.

188
00:10:03,477 --> 00:10:05,521
DANIELS:
This is a very important day, Jonathan.

189
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:08,524
-I don't have time for this.
-It'll only take a minute.

190
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:12,612
You see the fellow in the blue jacket,
near the left end of the dais?

191
00:10:12,695 --> 00:10:15,823
That's you,
a little more than seven years from now.

192
00:10:15,906 --> 00:10:18,034
You and the others
are about to make history.

193
00:10:24,999 --> 00:10:27,752
Do you remember I told you
about a federation?

194
00:10:28,502 --> 00:10:30,254
What about it?

195
00:10:30,338 --> 00:10:31,922
I work with some people
who are going to be

196
00:10:32,006 --> 00:10:33,591
pretty angry at me for telling you this,

197
00:10:33,674 --> 00:10:37,803
but you're going to be an integral part
of forming that federation.

198
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:39,805
You're down there right now,

199
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:42,099
with Vulcans, Andorians, and Tellarites,

200
00:10:42,183 --> 00:10:44,143
getting ready to sign the charter.

201
00:10:44,226 --> 00:10:45,936
The membership is going to grow...

202
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:48,606
dozens, eventually hundreds of species.

203
00:10:48,689 --> 00:10:51,067
A united federation of planets.

204
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:53,736
I have a team preparing
to board the weapon.

205
00:10:53,819 --> 00:10:55,529
I've got other things
to think about right now.

206
00:10:55,613 --> 00:10:58,115
Let Reed or one of the others
go to the control platform.

207
00:10:58,199 --> 00:11:00,409
-What are you talking about?
-It's too great a risk.

208
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:02,495
If you're killed,
none of this will happen...

209
00:11:02,578 --> 00:11:04,205
At least,
not the way it's supposed to happen.

210
00:11:04,288 --> 00:11:06,540
Then it'll happen some other way.

211
00:11:06,624 --> 00:11:09,251
Who's to say whether
it'll be better or worse?

212
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:12,004
It's essential you be a part of this.

213
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:14,256
Where are we?

214
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:17,176
-What planet?
-Earth.

215
00:11:17,259 --> 00:11:20,763
Seems to me it's just as essential
that Earth be around for this, too.

216
00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:22,723
Lieutenant Reed can work with Sato.

217
00:11:22,807 --> 00:11:24,183
( applause )

218
00:11:24,266 --> 00:11:26,811
They are not crucial
to the future of mankind.

219
00:11:26,894 --> 00:11:28,145
You are.

220
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:34,527
My mission is to save Earth,
not your federation.

221
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:37,029
You can't ignore your place in history.

222
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:42,618
My place is on that control platform.

223
00:11:42,701 --> 00:11:44,995
Now get me the hell back to Degra's ship.

224
00:11:47,665 --> 00:11:49,583
And if it's not too much
of an inconvenience,

225
00:11:49,667 --> 00:11:55,423
I'd appreciate it if you'd contact
my first wife's third husband, Groznik.

226
00:11:57,383 --> 00:12:02,012
Uh, tell him that he's welcome to keep
the Aldebaran drum set I loaned him.

227
00:12:02,096 --> 00:12:05,724
Oh, they have a child named Indaura.

228
00:12:06,517 --> 00:12:10,229
Sweet little girl...
She must be, uh, 8 or 9 by now.

229
00:12:10,312 --> 00:12:11,939
( laughs )

230
00:12:12,022 --> 00:12:16,694
Well, I would like to leave her
my botanical library.

231
00:12:16,777 --> 00:12:18,821
She always had a flair for plants.

232
00:12:18,904 --> 00:12:20,406
Computer, pause recording.

233
00:12:22,533 --> 00:12:23,784
Everything's ready here.

234
00:12:23,868 --> 00:12:25,161
( clears throat )

235
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:29,165
Commander Tucker has completed
his modifications to the deflector.

236
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:32,334
I apologize if I interrupted you.

237
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:34,587
Oh, no, no, don't be silly.

238
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:38,466
I was simply dictating a letter
to my colleague, Dr. Lucas.

239
00:12:38,549 --> 00:12:42,511
He offered to make sure my affairs
were in order in the event that, uh...

240
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:45,806
Well, you know. ( chuckles )

241
00:12:46,765 --> 00:12:49,101
I've always found it distracting
to think of death,

242
00:12:49,185 --> 00:12:51,937
especially when entering
a dangerous situation.

243
00:12:52,021 --> 00:12:55,274
Hmm. Hope for the best,
prepare for the worst.

244
00:12:55,357 --> 00:12:57,610
I don't know about Vulcans,
but Denobulans take great pleasure

245
00:12:57,693 --> 00:13:00,696
in bequeathing their belongings
to far-flung relatives.

246
00:13:00,779 --> 00:13:01,989
We're not dead yet.

247
00:13:02,072 --> 00:13:04,283
-( computer beeps )
-MAN: <i>Bridge to T'Pol.</i>

248
00:13:07,828 --> 00:13:08,954
Go ahead.

249
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:10,331
<i>We're approaching the coordinates.</i>

250
00:13:10,414 --> 00:13:11,916
Take us out of warp.

251
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:16,420
Hope for the best, Doctor.

252
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:33,896
-( computer beeping )
-TRAVIS: It's grown.

253
00:13:33,979 --> 00:13:37,024
It's 100,000 kilometers deeper
than when we first detected it.

254
00:13:37,107 --> 00:13:39,818
I've enhanced the neuroleptic
compound as much as I can.

255
00:13:39,902 --> 00:13:41,529
I strongly advise we remain

256
00:13:41,612 --> 00:13:44,573
in the disturbance
no longer than 15 minutes.

257
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:46,617
Are you ready to release the compound?

258
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:49,620
Then proceed.

259
00:13:49,703 --> 00:13:51,997
Stand by to charge the deflector.

260
00:13:52,081 --> 00:13:53,707
Set a course, Ensign.

261
00:13:56,293 --> 00:13:58,379
ARCHER: <i>Captain's starlog, supplemental.</i>

262
00:13:58,462 --> 00:14:01,215
<i>We've begun to formulate a plan,</i>
<i>thanks to Hoshi,</i>

263
00:14:01,298 --> 00:14:04,927
<i>who's made some progress</i>
<i>in decrypting the schematics.</i>

264
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:07,221
What have you guys figured out?

265
00:14:07,304 --> 00:14:10,015
ARCHER: We've got to disable
the reactor at a specific point

266
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:12,017
during the inversion sequence,

267
00:14:12,101 --> 00:14:14,562
but we don't know the sequence.

268
00:14:14,645 --> 00:14:16,564
If it's not done in the right order,

269
00:14:16,647 --> 00:14:18,440
the internal safeguards will kick in,

270
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:20,609
and it'll be impossible
to create an overload.

271
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:24,071
I found the sequence,
but decrypting it is another story.

272
00:14:24,154 --> 00:14:27,116
Your friend Degra didn't make this easy.

273
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:29,451
I wish I could tell you to take your time.

274
00:14:31,787 --> 00:14:34,039
The first time you came
to visit me in Brazil...

275
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:35,708
It didn't stop raining for a week.

276
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:37,835
I had a bug then too.

277
00:14:37,918 --> 00:14:42,006
A tropical bacteria,
not a reptilian parasite.

278
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:46,343
I was sick as a dog,

279
00:14:46,427 --> 00:14:49,096
but I wanted to make a good impression.

280
00:14:49,179 --> 00:14:50,931
When we get back home,

281
00:14:51,015 --> 00:14:56,020
I'll see to it you get some R&amp;R
in Norway or Canada...

282
00:14:56,103 --> 00:14:58,606
someplace where there's not
a tropical bug in sight.

283
00:14:58,689 --> 00:15:01,692
-Or reptiles.
-Or reptiles.

284
00:15:01,775 --> 00:15:03,819
Keep at it.

285
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:05,571
I'll get these to the bridge.

286
00:15:10,951 --> 00:15:13,746
We've gotten close enough
to isolate their signatures.

287
00:15:13,829 --> 00:15:17,666
The Insectoid ship is no longer with them.

288
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:19,376
Why would they leave the vortex?

289
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:20,878
We have no idea.

290
00:15:20,961 --> 00:15:23,255
All we know is that the weapon
is being escorted

291
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:26,467
by a single Reptilian vessel... Dolim's.

292
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:30,763
At least we'll only have
one ship to contend with.

293
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:40,147
Here we go.

294
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:44,109
-Doctor?
-Fifteen minutes and counting.

295
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:49,657
Any sign of the sphere?

296
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:51,158
It's too soon.

297
00:15:52,993 --> 00:15:54,286
Hold your course.

298
00:15:57,456 --> 00:16:00,793
Degra's vessel is less than
20 minutes behind us.

299
00:16:00,876 --> 00:16:03,712
Lieutenant, we're about
to drop into normal space.

300
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:06,840
<i>Stand by to initiate the firing sequence.</i>

301
00:16:06,924 --> 00:16:08,676
We're ready.

302
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:11,303
Are you detecting any Earth vessels
near the coordinates?

303
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:15,140
No vessels,
but there is one small orbital station.

304
00:16:17,768 --> 00:16:18,978
Unarmed.

305
00:16:27,027 --> 00:16:28,654
Let me see Earth.

306
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:33,200
Enlarge.

307
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:41,583
It's a shame.

308
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:44,044
All that water.

309
00:16:44,128 --> 00:16:47,548
The Aquatics would feel at home here.

310
00:16:49,633 --> 00:16:51,010
I've got it.

311
00:16:51,093 --> 00:16:52,094
How far?

312
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:53,220
20,000 kilometers.

313
00:16:53,303 --> 00:16:54,722
Thirteen minutes left.

314
00:16:54,805 --> 00:16:57,266
As soon as we make visual contact,
go to thrusters.

315
00:16:57,349 --> 00:17:00,602
Set a heading
to latitude 15 degrees north.

316
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:03,022
-Deflector?
-Standing by.

317
00:17:13,741 --> 00:17:16,452
They're 800,000 kilometers ahead.

318
00:17:18,328 --> 00:17:19,455
Get your team ready to go.

319
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:21,165
Aye, sir.

320
00:17:21,248 --> 00:17:23,792
Dolim's changing course.

321
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:26,170
They're heading for a space station.

322
00:17:26,253 --> 00:17:27,838
Are we in visual range?

323
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:33,886
Yosemite Three?

324
00:17:33,969 --> 00:17:35,429
A military installation?

325
00:17:35,512 --> 00:17:37,556
A research post.

326
00:17:37,639 --> 00:17:40,100
Usually 30 to 40 civilians aboard.

327
00:17:44,605 --> 00:17:47,566
Hail them on this frequency.

328
00:17:47,649 --> 00:17:48,984
( computer beeps )

329
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:50,986
The weapon's emitting disruption waves.

330
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:52,946
I can't get anything through.

331
00:17:59,286 --> 00:18:00,829
Fifteen degrees north.

332
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:03,165
Drop to 2,000 meters.

333
00:18:03,248 --> 00:18:06,210
Track starboard, 82 mark zero.

334
00:18:06,293 --> 00:18:07,461
Aye.

335
00:18:08,462 --> 00:18:10,964
Doc, there's something weird
happening to my skin.

336
00:18:11,048 --> 00:18:12,758
-Me too!
-It was expected.

337
00:18:12,841 --> 00:18:15,177
Try not to scratch it.
Eleven minutes remaining.

338
00:18:18,555 --> 00:18:21,517
The guardians said
that once Earth is gone,

339
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,937
we're to destroy all human colonies.

340
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:28,565
I see no reason not to begin
with this station.

341
00:18:28,649 --> 00:18:31,401
Target. Fire when ready.

342
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:51,130
They're heading back toward the weapon.

343
00:18:58,011 --> 00:18:59,638
Ten degrees port.

344
00:18:59,721 --> 00:19:01,765
Slow to 30 kph.

345
00:19:01,849 --> 00:19:05,102
I'm transferring the target point
to the deflector array.

346
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:08,438
Got it.

347
00:19:08,522 --> 00:19:09,940
Begin.

348
00:19:15,904 --> 00:19:17,489
Fish in a barrel.

349
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:21,660
Less than 10 minutes to go.

350
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:32,212
( indistinct conversations )

351
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:51,190
( groans )

352
00:19:59,573 --> 00:20:00,908
( rumbling )

353
00:20:00,991 --> 00:20:02,451
What the hell's going on?

354
00:20:02,534 --> 00:20:04,036
Power just fell 10%.

355
00:20:04,119 --> 00:20:06,830
I'm picking up explosions on "E" deck.

356
00:20:06,914 --> 00:20:09,583
Bridge to engineering. Report.

357
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:11,543
-( computer beeps )
-I'm losing the beam.

358
00:20:11,627 --> 00:20:13,629
There are nine alien life-signs aboard.

359
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:15,631
They appear to be
trans-dimensional beings.

360
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:17,841
-How is that possible?
-This disturbance we're in,

361
00:20:17,925 --> 00:20:20,385
it's obviously been altered
enough to sustain them.

362
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:23,347
Who's on Degra's ship?

363
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:28,268
Eight primates, three Arboreals...
and seven humans.

364
00:20:29,353 --> 00:20:32,522
-Have their weapons been upgraded?
-No, sir.

365
00:20:32,606 --> 00:20:35,901
Pathetic. Prepare to intercept.

366
00:20:38,362 --> 00:20:41,114
They're arming their torpedoes.

367
00:20:41,198 --> 00:20:42,324
Sir.

368
00:20:44,034 --> 00:20:46,703
-How's Hoshi doing?
-She's holding up.

369
00:20:46,787 --> 00:20:49,164
She and the Macos
are at the transporter device.

370
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:54,169
Remember, no heroics.

371
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:56,588
Just get us in
and then keep them off your ass.

372
00:20:56,672 --> 00:20:59,424
( computer beeping )

373
00:20:59,508 --> 00:21:02,010
There's another vessel
approaching at high warp.

374
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:03,345
They're asking for you.

375
00:21:06,974 --> 00:21:09,393
<i>You're not using your head, pink-skin.</i>

376
00:21:09,476 --> 00:21:12,104
<i>That ship you're on</i>
<i>is no match for the Reptilian.</i>

377
00:21:12,187 --> 00:21:14,273
I'm busy, Shran. What are you doing here?

378
00:21:14,356 --> 00:21:17,943
<i>You should be impressed we managed</i>
<i>to track you through the vortex.</i>

379
00:21:18,026 --> 00:21:21,196
<i>I anticipated that you'd need some help.</i>

380
00:21:29,746 --> 00:21:32,082
( all groan )

381
00:21:32,165 --> 00:21:34,126
TUCKER: Corporal Kelly to the bridge.

382
00:21:34,209 --> 00:21:35,627
Go ahead.

383
00:21:35,711 --> 00:21:37,629
Our weapons are passing
right through them.

384
00:21:37,713 --> 00:21:40,132
You got to stop this.
If I don't get full power back,

385
00:21:40,215 --> 00:21:42,175
this is gonna take three, four minutes
longer than we thought.

386
00:21:42,259 --> 00:21:43,635
We can't afford three or four minutes.

387
00:21:43,719 --> 00:21:45,679
Corporal Kelly, listen to me very closely.

388
00:21:45,762 --> 00:21:47,973
Modulate your weapons
to a rotating frequency

389
00:21:48,056 --> 00:21:50,309
of 32.6 teracycles.

390
00:21:50,392 --> 00:21:52,311
-Doctor?
-Our trans-dimensional friend,

391
00:21:52,394 --> 00:21:53,812
the one we found in the pod...

392
00:21:53,895 --> 00:21:56,398
I had quite a few hours
to study his physiology.

393
00:21:56,481 --> 00:21:59,318
Let's hope my memory serves me well.

394
00:21:59,401 --> 00:22:01,570
I'll be right in front of you, gentlemen.

395
00:22:01,653 --> 00:22:03,947
<i>Keep a low profile.</i>

396
00:22:04,031 --> 00:22:05,782
We're matching speed.

397
00:22:05,866 --> 00:22:09,036
You said there were
no human vessels in the vicinity.

398
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:10,287
They're not human.

399
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:13,040
Destroy them both.

400
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:23,258
That third torpedo almost got you.
Be careful!

401
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:24,676
Prepare to come about to port.

402
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,386
<i>Stay below me.</i>

403
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:29,264
We'll need to get
within a kilometer of the weapon.

404
00:22:29,347 --> 00:22:31,558
<i>Just stay below me.</i>

405
00:22:35,937 --> 00:22:38,690
Let's fight back this time, shall we?

406
00:22:38,774 --> 00:22:41,610
Bring the forward cannons online.

407
00:22:52,746 --> 00:22:54,331
SHRAN: Go!

408
00:22:54,414 --> 00:22:57,751
And tell Archer we're not even anymore.

409
00:22:57,834 --> 00:22:59,795
He owes me!

410
00:23:10,972 --> 00:23:12,808
( all groan )

411
00:23:24,945 --> 00:23:26,446
It's coming back.

412
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:28,907
Tell them to keep doing
what they're doing.

413
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:40,001
-( beep )
<i>-Walker to the bridge.</i>

414
00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:41,920
-Go ahead.
<i>-We've secured engineering,</i>

415
00:23:42,003 --> 00:23:43,922
<i>but I don't think</i>
<i>we've seen the last of them.</i>

416
00:23:45,048 --> 00:23:47,008
It's time for you to work your magic,
Mr. Tucker.

417
00:23:47,092 --> 00:23:49,886
Within five minutes, everyone in this ship
is going to start dying.

418
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:51,263
No pressure.

419
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:56,268
OK, bring up the inversion sequence.

420
00:23:56,351 --> 00:23:59,604
Start with the third one from the left.

421
00:24:11,324 --> 00:24:12,325
Got it.

422
00:24:12,409 --> 00:24:14,035
The second from the right.

423
00:24:25,881 --> 00:24:27,090
( gasps )

424
00:24:27,174 --> 00:24:28,383
Hoshi?

425
00:24:30,385 --> 00:24:31,803
I'm all right!

426
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:36,391
The first one on the left is next.

427
00:24:40,937 --> 00:24:44,482
Commander, sensors show the humans
are no longer aboard Degra's vessel.

428
00:24:44,566 --> 00:24:47,694
These ships are drawing us away
from the weapon.

429
00:24:47,777 --> 00:24:49,321
Get us back!

430
00:25:00,999 --> 00:25:02,250
( rumbling )

431
00:25:02,334 --> 00:25:04,002
-( computer beeps )
-What's going on?

432
00:25:04,085 --> 00:25:06,046
Ignore it, Commander.
You've got less than two minutes.

433
00:25:10,884 --> 00:25:12,886
Got it. Two to go.

434
00:25:17,891 --> 00:25:19,017
( groans )

435
00:25:20,602 --> 00:25:23,480
( screaming )

436
00:25:45,043 --> 00:25:46,294
( groaning )

437
00:25:54,219 --> 00:25:55,303
( gasps )

438
00:26:01,059 --> 00:26:02,310
Hoshi?

439
00:26:17,492 --> 00:26:19,327
( grunting )

440
00:26:20,495 --> 00:26:21,496
( communicator beeps )

441
00:26:21,579 --> 00:26:23,456
-Reed to Archer.
<i>-Go ahead.</i>

442
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:25,250
I'm pretty certain that was
the last of them, sir.

443
00:26:25,333 --> 00:26:27,419
<i>Good work. Now get back here.</i>

444
00:26:32,674 --> 00:26:35,051
-( computer beeping )
-T'Pol.

445
00:26:35,135 --> 00:26:36,761
-T'Pol!
-All right!

446
00:26:38,513 --> 00:26:41,308
Take us to full impulse.
Get us out of here.

447
00:26:41,391 --> 00:26:42,600
Wait a minute. I'm almost there!

448
00:26:42,684 --> 00:26:44,394
You don't have a minute, Commander!

449
00:26:44,477 --> 00:26:46,563
Then give me 10 seconds.
I'm telling you, I've got it.

450
00:26:52,527 --> 00:26:54,571
-( computer beeping )
-That's it! Time's up!

451
00:26:54,654 --> 00:26:56,281
It sure is.

452
00:27:05,165 --> 00:27:06,583
Now, Mr. Mayweather!

453
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:26,811
( choking )

454
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:34,611
( computer beeps )

455
00:27:34,694 --> 00:27:36,780
The network is being destroyed.

456
00:27:36,863 --> 00:27:39,366
Looks like we're getting out of this soup
faster than we thought.

457
00:27:39,449 --> 00:27:40,992
Without the sphere,
their transformed space

458
00:27:41,076 --> 00:27:42,744
must be collapsing in on itself.

459
00:27:48,083 --> 00:27:49,501
Which one, Hoshi?

460
00:27:49,584 --> 00:27:51,961
Number four, the fourth one from the left.

461
00:27:52,045 --> 00:27:53,922
-Are you sure?
-Yes, yes.

462
00:27:54,005 --> 00:27:58,343
Number five is the last one
after you disable the reactor.

463
00:28:05,475 --> 00:28:07,811
But if we knock the reactor out,
won't that be enough?

464
00:28:07,894 --> 00:28:10,397
We didn't come here
to disable this weapon.

465
00:28:11,564 --> 00:28:13,149
We're here to destroy it.

466
00:28:13,233 --> 00:28:14,442
Give me the charges.

467
00:28:14,526 --> 00:28:16,111
I'll take care of it, sir.

468
00:28:16,194 --> 00:28:18,988
I want the four of you
to get to the outer framework.

469
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:20,323
Beam back to Degra's ship.

470
00:28:20,407 --> 00:28:21,825
As Chief Tactical Officer, sir--

471
00:28:21,908 --> 00:28:23,451
This isn't open for debate, Lieutenant.

472
00:28:43,888 --> 00:28:45,515
Don't worry, I'll be right behind you.

473
00:29:08,955 --> 00:29:10,206
( beeping )

474
00:29:28,558 --> 00:29:30,518
( alarm blaring )

475
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:36,775
Ugh!

476
00:29:36,858 --> 00:29:39,986
What have you done?

477
00:29:40,069 --> 00:29:41,237
( groans )

478
00:30:18,316 --> 00:30:21,820
One Reptilian transported to the weapon.

479
00:30:21,903 --> 00:30:24,948
Let's make sure
he has nowhere to go back to.

480
00:30:25,031 --> 00:30:27,784
They have no shielding
on their starboard engines.

481
00:30:27,867 --> 00:30:29,452
Target all weapons.

482
00:30:36,376 --> 00:30:37,585
Can you get a lock on him?

483
00:30:37,669 --> 00:30:38,962
Not yet.

484
00:30:39,045 --> 00:30:42,340
Your captain is too deep
within the weapon.

485
00:31:01,109 --> 00:31:02,610
( groaning )

486
00:31:18,668 --> 00:31:20,044
( beeping )

487
00:31:58,082 --> 00:32:02,503
T'POL: <i>Acting Captain's starlog,</i>
<i>February 14, 2152.</i>

488
00:32:02,587 --> 00:32:04,213
<i>We're holding position at the coordinates</i>

489
00:32:04,297 --> 00:32:06,507
<i>where we were told to meet</i>
<i>Degra's vessel.</i>

490
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:09,177
<i>So far, there's been no word from them.</i>

491
00:32:09,761 --> 00:32:14,390
Long-range sensors are detecting
no evidence of the spheres.

492
00:32:14,474 --> 00:32:15,892
TUCKER: None of them?

493
00:32:15,975 --> 00:32:17,060
None.

494
00:32:20,355 --> 00:32:24,400
And all the spatial anomalies
within our scanning range have vanished.

495
00:32:24,484 --> 00:32:27,070
What about the thermobaric cloud barrier?

496
00:32:28,571 --> 00:32:31,824
I can only detect a small section
from our present location,

497
00:32:31,908 --> 00:32:35,453
but it appears to be dissipating.

498
00:32:35,536 --> 00:32:37,538
Looks like we kept our end of the bargain.

499
00:32:37,622 --> 00:32:41,376
It would appear that the Expanse
is returning to normal space.

500
00:32:44,587 --> 00:32:46,714
We should've heard something by now.

501
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:48,091
What if they failed?

502
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:51,219
Earth could be--

503
00:32:51,302 --> 00:32:52,679
Be patient.

504
00:32:54,389 --> 00:32:56,224
( sighs )

505
00:32:57,308 --> 00:33:00,645
And my skin's healing faster than yours.

506
00:33:01,312 --> 00:33:03,940
I guess you Vulcans
aren't so tough after all.

507
00:33:04,023 --> 00:33:06,192
Dr. Phlox says we should all
be back to normal

508
00:33:06,275 --> 00:33:07,568
within two to three days.

509
00:33:07,652 --> 00:33:09,404
I'm only kidding.

510
00:33:11,531 --> 00:33:14,575
You look nice like this,

511
00:33:14,659 --> 00:33:16,828
kind of like an old oil painting.

512
00:33:19,789 --> 00:33:21,916
I am not old.

513
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,253
I will only be 66 years old
on my next birthday.

514
00:33:28,172 --> 00:33:30,591
I can't believe you told me that.

515
00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:32,552
You accused me of looking old.

516
00:33:32,635 --> 00:33:33,928
That's not what I mean.

517
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:35,972
I've been trying to get you
to tell me your age

518
00:33:36,055 --> 00:33:37,765
since we left spacedock.

519
00:33:38,891 --> 00:33:40,518
Why now?

520
00:33:40,601 --> 00:33:45,314
To Vulcans, certain information
is considered intimate.

521
00:33:47,650 --> 00:33:49,777
Intimate? Hmm...

522
00:33:49,861 --> 00:33:52,739
-( computer beeps )
-TRAVIS: <i>Bridge to T'Pol.</i>

523
00:33:52,822 --> 00:33:54,365
Go ahead.

524
00:33:54,449 --> 00:33:56,993
<i>A vortex just opened. It's Degra's ship.</i>

525
00:33:58,995 --> 00:34:01,706
( static )

526
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:05,084
This is <i>Enterprise. </i>Please repeat.

527
00:34:08,337 --> 00:34:11,340
-Captain, did you stop the weapon?
-( static )

528
00:34:11,424 --> 00:34:13,051
Captain?

529
00:34:13,134 --> 00:34:16,304
( computer beeps )

530
00:34:16,387 --> 00:34:18,306
Set an intercept course.

531
00:34:34,363 --> 00:34:36,449
It's done.

532
00:34:36,532 --> 00:34:37,825
Done?

533
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:40,995
Captain Archer destroyed the weapon.

534
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:42,789
Where is he? Is he OK?

535
00:34:48,086 --> 00:34:50,004
Captain didn't make it, Trip.

536
00:34:52,673 --> 00:34:54,550
What do you mean, he didn't make it?

537
00:34:54,634 --> 00:34:59,305
The weapon exploded
before he could transport to Degra's ship.

538
00:35:20,451 --> 00:35:22,578
( computer beeps )

539
00:35:22,662 --> 00:35:24,122
Come in.

540
00:35:28,668 --> 00:35:30,962
Thank you.

541
00:35:31,045 --> 00:35:34,882
The Aquatic vessel should
have you home in less than a day.

542
00:35:36,926 --> 00:35:40,388
I was pleased to hear that
the Council has agreed to reconvene.

543
00:35:40,471 --> 00:35:45,601
It was difficult for the Insectoids
to ignore recent events.

544
00:35:45,685 --> 00:35:47,520
And the Reptilians?

545
00:35:47,603 --> 00:35:50,022
They will join us eventually.

546
00:35:50,106 --> 00:35:55,528
They have no choice but to accept
that the guardians' promises were empty.

547
00:35:59,115 --> 00:36:02,952
Your captain's sacrifice
will not be forgotten.

548
00:36:05,329 --> 00:36:06,998
Safe journey.

549
00:36:09,125 --> 00:36:10,710
Thank you.

550
00:36:18,801 --> 00:36:21,012
-( animals squeaking )
-It's all right.

551
00:36:21,095 --> 00:36:24,473
It's all right.
It won't be much longer, I promise.

552
00:36:24,557 --> 00:36:26,184
( sighs )

553
00:36:27,852 --> 00:36:29,312
Is something wrong?

554
00:36:29,395 --> 00:36:32,440
Oh, I think they sense
that we are traveling

555
00:36:32,523 --> 00:36:34,192
in an unusual manner...

556
00:36:34,275 --> 00:36:37,653
In the, uh, belly of the beast,
so to speak.

557
00:36:37,737 --> 00:36:39,363
There are no windows here.

558
00:36:39,447 --> 00:36:41,741
How would they know we're inside
the Aquatic vessel?

559
00:36:41,824 --> 00:36:43,868
I don't have the slightest idea.

560
00:36:43,951 --> 00:36:46,495
But I doubt I'll get much
peace and quiet around here

561
00:36:46,579 --> 00:36:48,623
until we are flying under our own power.

562
00:36:48,706 --> 00:36:50,499
It'll only be a few more hours.

563
00:36:50,583 --> 00:36:51,918
Hmm...

564
00:36:52,418 --> 00:36:54,378
Is there something I can do for you?

565
00:36:56,464 --> 00:36:58,674
My skin hasn't fully healed yet.

566
00:37:01,093 --> 00:37:03,221
Oh, you're doing fine.

567
00:37:03,304 --> 00:37:08,309
Vulcans are obviously more sensitive
to the effects of mysterious realms.

568
00:37:08,392 --> 00:37:10,853
I guess we're not so tough after all.

569
00:37:11,395 --> 00:37:13,105
Excuse me?

570
00:37:13,189 --> 00:37:15,358
Is there anything I'll need to treat this?

571
00:37:16,859 --> 00:37:18,069
Only time.

572
00:37:20,446 --> 00:37:21,697
How's morale?

573
00:37:24,659 --> 00:37:27,203
It isn't easy for a crew
to lose its captain.

574
00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:32,541
I suppose we'll all need time to heal.

575
00:37:37,171 --> 00:37:38,673
Will he be all right?

576
00:37:41,217 --> 00:37:42,718
Not for a while.

577
00:37:45,721 --> 00:37:47,473
He lost his best friend.

578
00:37:49,517 --> 00:37:52,728
But it's just a matter of time.

579
00:37:52,812 --> 00:37:54,522
He'll be fine again.

580
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:57,400
Did you hear that?

581
00:37:58,234 --> 00:38:00,111
The doctor says you'll be fine.

582
00:38:02,655 --> 00:38:04,490
It's just a matter of time.

583
00:38:20,131 --> 00:38:21,173
T'POL: Distance?

584
00:38:21,799 --> 00:38:23,926
800,000 kilometers.

585
00:38:24,385 --> 00:38:26,220
Set a course, Ensign.

586
00:38:28,347 --> 00:38:29,890
You should be in your quarters.

587
00:38:29,974 --> 00:38:31,684
With all due respect to Phlox,

588
00:38:31,767 --> 00:38:33,936
I wouldn't miss this for the world.

589
00:38:38,691 --> 00:38:39,984
Mind if we take a look?

590
00:38:52,455 --> 00:38:55,458
Prettiest sight I ever saw.

591
00:38:55,541 --> 00:38:57,335
It's all in one piece.

592
00:38:58,002 --> 00:38:59,670
The Captain would be proud.

593
00:39:00,921 --> 00:39:03,257
Open a channel to Starfleet headquarters.

594
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:04,633
( computer beeping )

595
00:39:09,972 --> 00:39:11,515
Strange.

596
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:13,017
What?

597
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:14,852
They're not responding.

598
00:39:17,063 --> 00:39:19,690
You'd think they'd be waiting
with bated breath.

599
00:39:19,774 --> 00:39:21,150
Try another frequency.

600
00:39:23,110 --> 00:39:25,363
I'm not picking up the orbital platforms.

601
00:39:26,447 --> 00:39:29,325
The Reptilians destroyed Yosemite station.

602
00:39:29,408 --> 00:39:31,118
It's not just Yosemite.

603
00:39:31,952 --> 00:39:35,289
There's nothing coming from any of them.

604
00:39:35,956 --> 00:39:38,000
I've rotated through all the frequencies.

605
00:39:39,752 --> 00:39:42,046
Contact the Lunar One colony.

606
00:39:42,129 --> 00:39:43,798
I already tried.

607
00:39:48,135 --> 00:39:49,887
Prepare a shuttlepod.

608
00:39:49,970 --> 00:39:52,640
I want you and Ensign Mayweather
to get down to San Francisco.

609
00:39:52,723 --> 00:39:54,100
Find out what's wrong.

610
00:40:11,992 --> 00:40:14,745
Looks pretty normal to me.

611
00:40:15,246 --> 00:40:17,873
Then why the hell doesn't anyone
want to talk to us?

612
00:40:18,707 --> 00:40:20,084
( sighs )

613
00:40:20,167 --> 00:40:23,587
Land at the pad behind the command center.

614
00:40:23,671 --> 00:40:26,215
Finally!
We've got three vessels approaching.

615
00:40:26,298 --> 00:40:27,675
It's about time.

616
00:40:27,758 --> 00:40:29,510
( computer beeps )

617
00:40:29,593 --> 00:40:32,471
This is Commander Charles Tucker
of the starship <i>Enterprise.</i>

618
00:40:32,555 --> 00:40:34,598
-You guys gave us quite a--
-( machine-gun fire )

619
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:37,977
What the hell?

620
00:40:38,769 --> 00:40:39,854
Sir.

621
00:40:53,617 --> 00:40:56,412
( conversations in German )
