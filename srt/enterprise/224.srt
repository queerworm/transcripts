I'LL HAVE A BEER, MR. TUCKER.

343
00:19:18,992 --> 00:19:21,786
IT'S BEEN AWHILE
SINCE I'VE BEEN IN HERE.

344
00:19:23,037 --> 00:19:26,749

ON YOUR MIND, SIR?

346
00:19:31,253 --> 00:19:33,422
FORREST:
I CAME HERE TO TELL YOU...

347
00:19:35,341 --> 00:19:39,595
AT THE URGING OF
THE VULCAN ADVISORY COUNCIL,

348
00:19:39,637 --> 00:19:42,056
THAT STARFLEET COMMAND
HAS DECIDED

349
00:19:42,098 --> 00:19:44,142
TO PUT THE NX PROGRAM ON HOLD.

350
00:19:45,601 --> 00:19:47,854
ARCHER: FOR HOW LONG?

351
00:19:47,895 --> 00:19:49,563
FORREST: INDEFINITELY.

352
00:19:51,107 --> 00:19:54,152

TUCKER: ONE BEER.

353
00:19:55,486 --> 00:19:58,322
ARCHER: WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
INDEFINITELY?

354
00:19:58,364 --> 00:20:00,449
FORREST: THEY WANT TO GO
BACK TO THE DRAWING BOARD, JON,

355
00:20:00,491 --> 00:20:03,161
DEVELOP A NEW ENGINE
FROM SCRATCH.

356
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:05,412
ARCHER: WE HAVE AN ENGINE
THAT WORKS NOW.

357
00:20:05,454 --> 00:20:07,081
IF WE START OVER,
IT'LL BE DECADES

358
00:20:07,123 --> 00:20:08,541

TUCKER: PERMISSION
TO SPEAK FREELY, SIR?

IT'S YOUR FATHER'S
ENGINE, HIS LIFE'S WORK.

GOING TO THROW A WRENCH

366
00:21:00,593 --> 00:21:02,344
IN MY CAREER PLANS.

00:21:20,404 --> 00:21:22,322
ROBINSON: DEBRIEFING.

372
00:21:22,364 --> 00:21:24,117
AFTER THE FLIGHT SURGEONS
WERE DONE WITH ME,

373
00:21:24,158 --> 00:21:26,160
I GOT HAULED IN FRONT
OF THE STARFLEET SENIOR STAFF

374
00:21:26,202 --> 00:21:27,828
AND THE VULCANS.

375
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:29,997
TUCKER: WHAT DID YOU TELL THEM?

376
00:21:30,039 --> 00:21:31,749
ROBINSON: WHAT DO YOU THINK?

377
00:21:31,791 --> 00:21:35,294
THE SUBSPACE FIELD DESTABILIZED
AT WARP 2.2.

378
00:21:35,335 --> 00:21:36,921
PRIMARY FLIGHT CONTROLS FAILED,

379
00:21:36,963 --> 00:21:38,464
RESULTING IN THE LOSS
OF THE VEHICLE.

380
00:21:38,505 --> 00:21:40,758
TUCKER:
AREN'T YOU FORGETTING SOMETHING?

381
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,760
ROBINSON: WHAT?

382
00:21:42,802 --> 00:21:45,096
TUCKER:
THE POSSIBILITY OF PILOT ERROR.

383
00:21:45,138 --> 00:21:48,432
ROBINSON: I'M NOT INTERESTED
IN YOUR OPINION, LIEUTENANT.

384
00:21:48,474 --> 00:21:50,143
ARCHER: YOU SHOULD BE.

385
00:21:50,184 --> 00:21:52,019
THE VULCANS HAVE BEEN
LEANING ON STARFLEET FOR YEARS

386
00:21:52,061 --> 00:21:53,938
TO REIN IN THIS PROGRAM.

387
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:56,149
YOU WALKED IN THERE TODAY,
RULED OUT PILOT ERROR,

388
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:58,067
AND TOLD THEM
JUST WHAT THEY WANTED TO HEAR--

389
00:21:58,109 --> 00:21:59,986
"OUR ENGINE DOESN'T WORK."

390
00:22:00,027 --> 00:22:01,737
ROBINSON: SORRY TO BE
THE BEARER OF BAD NEWS, ARCHER,

391
00:22:01,779 --> 00:22:03,322
BUT IT DOESN'T WORK.

392

TUCKER: THE ENGINE'S SOUND.

393
00:22:04,824 --> 00:22:06,993
WE JUST NEED MORE TIME
TO BALANCE THE INTERMIX.

394
00:22:07,034 --> 00:22:08,828

WE NEED MORE THAN TIME.

395
00:22:08,869 --> 00:22:10,329
ARCHER: I AGREE.

396
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:12,290
WE NEED A PILOT
WHO LISTENS TO ORDERS.

397
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:15,209
IF YOU'D ABORTED,
WE'D STILL HAVE A SHIP

398
00:22:15,251 --> 00:22:16,919
AND PROBABLY ANOTHER CHANCE.

399
00:22:16,961 --> 00:22:18,504

CHANCE TO WHAT, GET KILLED?

00:22:18,545 --> 00:22:20,131
ARCHER:
AT THE FIRST SIGN OF TROUBLE,

401
00:22:20,173 --> 00:22:21,757
YOU SHOULD'VE THROTTLED DOWN.

402
00:22:21,799 --> 00:22:23,176

MADE A DAMN BIT OF DIFFERENCE.

I GUESS WE'LL NEVER FIND OUT.

WITH THAT SHIP!

A PROBLEM WITH THIS PROJECT,

OR GRAVITATIONAL ANOMALIES

TO FACE THE TRUTH THIS TIME

BECAUSE THERE'S NOTHING LEFT
TO POINT A FINGER AT.

HE WAS RIGHT.

PROBABLY NOTHING MORE

FOR THE NX-02.
