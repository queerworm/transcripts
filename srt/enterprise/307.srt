1
00:00:02,127 --> 00:00:03,044
TARQUIN: <i>Hoshi.</i>

2
00:00:03,128 --> 00:00:05,422
ARCHER: <i>Previously on </i>
Star Trek Enterprise...

3
00:00:05,505 --> 00:00:07,090
TARQUIN:
I know you're on an urgent mission.

4
00:00:07,173 --> 00:00:08,299
Who are you?

5
00:00:08,383 --> 00:00:09,467
TARQUIN: Don't be frightened.

6
00:00:09,551 --> 00:00:11,052
What do you want?

7
00:00:11,136 --> 00:00:13,805
TARQUIN: You're searching for something.
I can help.

8
00:00:16,224 --> 00:00:18,852
HOSHI: <i>He was horrified that </i>
<i>seven million of us were killed.</i>

9
00:00:19,561 --> 00:00:22,939
<i>He says he's willing to use his abilities</i>
<i>to help us find the Xindi.</i>

10
00:00:24,149 --> 00:00:25,608
What's this?

11
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:28,278
It helps me extend
the range of my telepathy.

12
00:00:28,361 --> 00:00:30,113
He gave me these coordinates.

13
00:00:30,196 --> 00:00:32,198
-What are they for?
-A Xindi colony.

14
00:00:32,282 --> 00:00:34,367
He said they're building
part of the weapon there.

15
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:39,497
We're preparing to test the weapon

16
00:00:39,581 --> 00:00:42,917
on an uninhabited planet
in the Calindra system.

17
00:00:43,001 --> 00:00:46,004
But we're going to need
another shipment of Kemocite,

18
00:00:46,963 --> 00:00:49,674
at least 100 kilograms.

19
00:00:50,425 --> 00:00:52,719
I'll contact Gralik.

20
00:00:52,802 --> 00:00:57,599
If the test is successful,
how long before we can deploy the weapon?

21
00:00:59,684 --> 00:01:01,061
A matter of weeks.

22
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:35,238
There are no defensive systems.

23
00:02:35,321 --> 00:02:38,491
{\an8}No active sensor sweeps
or artificial satellites.

24
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:40,994
{\an8}No vessels anywhere in the vicinity.

25
00:02:41,744 --> 00:02:45,081
{\an8}We've seen how different
Xindi technology is.

26
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:47,458
{\an8}They could have defenses we can't detect.

27
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:53,339
{\an8}It's also possible that what we were told
about this colony isn't accurate.

28
00:02:54,257 --> 00:02:57,385
{\an8}We're putting a lot of faith
in Hoshi's telepathic friend.

29
00:03:04,142 --> 00:03:06,269
{\an8}What about these energy readings?

30
00:03:06,436 --> 00:03:08,605
They could be coming
from a weapons complex.

31
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:12,692
They could also be electrical storms,
deposits of diamagnetic ore...

32
00:03:12,775 --> 00:03:14,611
Or a glitch in our sensors, I know.

33
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:16,779
But if there's any chance
that something on that planet

34
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:19,866
could lead us to the Xindi weapon,
we have to investigate it.

35
00:03:23,119 --> 00:03:25,496
{\an8}After we enter the system,
we'll stay on the far side of that moon.

36
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:27,206
It should keep us out of view.

37
00:03:27,582 --> 00:03:30,877
Tell Major Hayes he'll be
joining us on a reconnaissance mission.

38
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,420
We launch in two hours.

39
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:41,346
{\an8}-Archer to <i>Enterprise.</i>
-T'POL: <i>Go ahead.</i>

40
00:03:41,429 --> 00:03:42,847
{\an8}I've found a landing site

41
00:03:42,931 --> 00:03:45,391
{\an8}12 kilometers north
of the energy readings.

42
00:03:45,475 --> 00:03:48,645
{\an8}-Any sign they've detected us?
-T'POL: <i>Scans are still negative.</i>

43
00:03:49,312 --> 00:03:50,772
{\an8}<i>Your signal's breaking up.</i>

44
00:03:51,522 --> 00:03:53,441
{\an8}I've set a steep approach vector,

45
00:03:54,484 --> 00:03:55,818
{\an8}and we've ionized the hull.

46
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:58,279
{\an8}It'll help disperse any scanning beams.

47
00:03:58,363 --> 00:03:59,572
{\an8}T'POL: <i>Acknowledged.</i>

48
00:03:59,656 --> 00:04:02,075
{\an8}If anyone sees us,
they'll think we're a meteor.

49
00:04:14,003 --> 00:04:17,382
{\an8}-ARCHER: How much farther?
-MALCOLM: 800 meters.

50
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:21,427
{\an8}Just over that rise.

51
00:04:39,654 --> 00:04:41,698
That's definitely the source
of the energy readings.

52
00:04:51,499 --> 00:04:53,459
-ARCHER: They're Xindi.
-HAYES: Reptilian?

53
00:04:53,543 --> 00:04:54,460
No.

54
00:04:54,544 --> 00:04:57,088
One of the other species
we saw in the database.

55
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:03,970
ARCHER: <i>We've picked up readings</i>
<i>across the spectrum...</i>

56
00:05:04,053 --> 00:05:06,431
<i>Positron emissions, antiproton bursts.</i>

57
00:05:06,514 --> 00:05:09,017
<i>Whatever they're doing in there,</i>
<i>it's using a lot of power.</i>

58
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:11,686
Corporal Hawkins is standing by
with an assault team.

59
00:05:11,769 --> 00:05:13,730
<i>Tell him to keep standing by.</i>

60
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:16,232
<i>I'm not ready </i>
<i>to send in the troops just yet.</i>

61
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:18,568
<i>We've checked out</i>
<i>the perimeter of the complex.</i>

62
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:20,570
<i>I think we can get inside</i>
<i>without being detected.</i>

63
00:05:20,903 --> 00:05:23,823
We'll maintain communications silence
inside the complex.

64
00:05:23,906 --> 00:05:26,576
I'll contact you at 0400. Archer out.

65
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:43,593
I'm not picking up any security devices.

66
00:05:43,676 --> 00:05:44,886
What about people?

67
00:05:44,969 --> 00:05:49,057
Approximately 80 inside the complex,
but not within 100 meters.

68
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:22,882
Captain.

69
00:06:24,467 --> 00:06:26,677
Some kind of radiolytic compound.

70
00:06:26,761 --> 00:06:28,846
It doesn't match anything in our database.

71
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:30,807
There's several hundred kilograms
in this room.

72
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:32,308
( clinking )

73
00:06:35,269 --> 00:06:36,646
( door opens )

74
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:40,108
There were impurities
in the last three production cycles.

75
00:06:40,191 --> 00:06:43,361
We found a ruptured seal
in the tertiary processing chamber.

76
00:06:43,444 --> 00:06:44,612
It's been repaired.

77
00:06:44,695 --> 00:06:47,657
We'll have to increase the production rate
by at least 60%.

78
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:49,075
Assign two additional teams.

79
00:06:49,158 --> 00:06:51,035
Degra isn't being realistic.

80
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:54,038
This facility wasn't designed
to manufacture such large quantities.

81
00:06:57,708 --> 00:07:00,294
Your job is to synthesize Kemocite.

82
00:07:00,378 --> 00:07:02,463
I suggest you get back to it.

83
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:06,509
Have these canisters retested.

84
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:09,512
Salvage what you can,
then destroy the rest.

85
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:53,431
We have it, Captain.

86
00:07:53,514 --> 00:07:55,766
ARCHER: <i>I need an analysis </i>
<i>as soon as possible.</i>

87
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:57,226
T'POL: Acknowledged.

88
00:07:59,353 --> 00:08:04,817
Captain, this place obviously has
something to do with the weapon.

89
00:08:04,901 --> 00:08:07,153
It seems to me the sooner
we put it out of commission, the better.

90
00:08:07,236 --> 00:08:08,529
Two spatial charges...

91
00:08:08,613 --> 00:08:11,616
That's all it would take
to destroy the complex from orbit.

92
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:14,410
That might set them back for a while,

93
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:17,121
but we can't lose sight
of our main objective.

94
00:08:17,955 --> 00:08:20,541
I want to know where they're
shipping this Kemocite.

95
00:08:21,542 --> 00:08:23,252
It could lead us to the weapon.

96
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:13,010
I have some questions for you.

97
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,856
GRALIK: Who are you?

98
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:32,071
What do you want from me?

99
00:09:32,154 --> 00:09:33,281
Sit down!

100
00:09:34,615 --> 00:09:36,075
There's nobody else here, sir.

101
00:09:36,158 --> 00:09:37,868
Apparently he lives alone.

102
00:09:41,497 --> 00:09:42,957
Stand watch outside.

103
00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:51,340
What's your name?

104
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:54,760
Gralik Durr.

105
00:09:54,844 --> 00:09:57,430
My name's Jonathan Archer.

106
00:09:58,014 --> 00:09:59,223
I'm from Earth.

107
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:04,687
Is that supposed to explain
why you forced your way into my home?

108
00:10:08,899 --> 00:10:10,610
Tell me about Kemocite.

109
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:14,405
It's a multi-phasic isotope.

110
00:10:14,488 --> 00:10:18,159
-Used for what?
-There are numerous applications.

111
00:10:18,242 --> 00:10:20,453
It depends on the level of refinement.

112
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:28,127
You're working with someone named Degra.

113
00:10:30,212 --> 00:10:34,008
-Who is he?
-That's none of your concern.

114
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:45,353
What's he using it for?

115
00:10:46,062 --> 00:10:49,231
Kemocite can be used
for any number of purposes.

116
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:51,025
I don't make a habit
of asking our clients

117
00:10:51,108 --> 00:10:52,735
what they plan to do with it.

118
00:10:52,818 --> 00:10:55,279
Maybe you should,
because this batch is being used

119
00:10:55,363 --> 00:10:57,490
to create a weapon
to exterminate my people!

120
00:10:58,282 --> 00:10:59,283
What?

121
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:00,910
I want to know where
the weapon is being built

122
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:02,536
and when it's going to be ready.

123
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:05,039
I don't know what you're talking about.

124
00:11:05,122 --> 00:11:07,625
I'm not leaving here
until I get the answers I need.

125
00:11:15,591 --> 00:11:19,011
I managed to identify
a sub-quantum imprint.

126
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:21,597
It matches the signature
of the Xindi probe.

127
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,349
TUCKER:
There's no doubt about it, Captain.

128
00:11:23,432 --> 00:11:26,352
This isotope was used in
the weapon that attacked Earth.

129
00:11:26,435 --> 00:11:28,729
T'POL: <i>Have you learned anything</i>
<i>from the interrogation?</i>

130
00:11:28,813 --> 00:11:30,856
Not yet, but this should help.

131
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:32,525
TUCKER: <i>Something else, Captain.</i>

132
00:11:32,608 --> 00:11:34,318
I ran a scan on that rifle we picked up.

133
00:11:34,402 --> 00:11:37,029
There it was again,
the same quantum imprint.

134
00:11:37,113 --> 00:11:38,906
I'd like permission to take it apart.

135
00:11:40,658 --> 00:11:41,700
Go ahead.

136
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:44,412
We'll contact you in a couple of hours.

137
00:11:44,495 --> 00:11:45,579
T'POL: <i>Understood.</i>

138
00:11:47,915 --> 00:11:49,500
Congratulations, sir.

139
00:11:50,835 --> 00:11:54,672
Three months ago, we entered the expanse
with no idea who these Xindi were,

140
00:11:54,755 --> 00:11:56,340
or how to find them.

141
00:11:56,424 --> 00:11:59,385
And now we're about to destroy
one of their weapons facilities.

142
00:12:08,102 --> 00:12:12,106
ARCHER: I thought we were here
to try and stop a war, not start one.

143
00:12:12,189 --> 00:12:13,816
MALCOLM: They struck first.

144
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:16,735
Because they were told
we're going to attack them.

145
00:12:16,819 --> 00:12:19,238
They think they're acting in self-defense.

146
00:12:19,321 --> 00:12:20,990
By destroying this complex,

147
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:23,951
we'll be confirming their worst fears
about humanity.

148
00:12:24,034 --> 00:12:27,413
Let's not forget the seven million people
that were killed.

149
00:12:40,301 --> 00:12:43,554
Have Major Hayes lay down
blast suppressors.

150
00:12:45,222 --> 00:12:47,641
When this facility goes,

151
00:12:47,725 --> 00:12:50,352
I don't want to take the rest
of the settlement with it.

152
00:12:56,275 --> 00:12:58,319
What about Gralik, sir?

153
00:12:58,402 --> 00:13:00,362
He'll tell them about <i>Enterprise.</i>

154
00:13:03,407 --> 00:13:06,035
I'll deal with Gralik when the time comes.

155
00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:10,998
I don't intend to let anyone know
we were here.

156
00:13:14,043 --> 00:13:16,337
I can't imagine what
the captain wants this for.

157
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:18,005
He was quite insistent.

158
00:13:18,088 --> 00:13:21,675
We ran the quantum analysis three times.

159
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:23,636
Doesn't he trust us?

160
00:13:23,719 --> 00:13:26,388
He said he needed it
to help prove a point.

161
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:35,356
How long are you going to keep me here?

162
00:13:35,439 --> 00:13:36,941
That's up to Captain Archer.

163
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:40,861
Well, you can tell him
that I'll be in my study.

164
00:13:40,945 --> 00:13:42,988
I'm afraid you're going
to have to stay right here.

165
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:45,741
-I have work to do.
-And I'm under orders.

166
00:13:46,033 --> 00:13:47,243
Please sit down.

167
00:13:49,286 --> 00:13:51,455
I've already told you everything I know.

168
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:54,625
( door opens )

169
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:56,293
Ah, Captain Archer.

170
00:13:56,377 --> 00:13:58,295
I was beginning to think
you'd forgotten about me.

171
00:14:06,136 --> 00:14:08,472
You said you weren't involved
in building weapons.

172
00:14:08,931 --> 00:14:10,182
That's correct.

173
00:14:10,975 --> 00:14:12,309
Explain this.

174
00:14:19,817 --> 00:14:21,277
I don't know what this is.

175
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:24,321
It's a fragment of a probe
that murdered seven million people.

176
00:14:25,072 --> 00:14:26,156
( clatters )

177
00:14:29,076 --> 00:14:31,745
The dead pilot was Xindi.

178
00:14:31,829 --> 00:14:33,664
The alloy is Xindi.

179
00:14:33,747 --> 00:14:35,583
And it's imprinted
with the quantum signature

180
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:37,668
of the compound you produce here!

181
00:14:37,751 --> 00:14:40,880
We know you're constructing
a larger version of the weapon

182
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:42,506
big enough to destroy a planet.

183
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:44,550
I want to know where it's being built!

184
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:48,888
You burst into my home,

185
00:14:49,346 --> 00:14:54,143
show me some twisted piece of metal,

186
00:14:54,226 --> 00:14:58,314
and tell me it proves I'm a mass murderer?

187
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,734
I've never seen your species before.

188
00:15:01,817 --> 00:15:03,861
I've never heard of a planet called Earth,

189
00:15:03,944 --> 00:15:05,571
and whether you believe me or not,

190
00:15:05,654 --> 00:15:08,824
I had nothing to do
with killing millions of its inhabitants.

191
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:19,209
I'm flattered you requested
my assistance, Commander,

192
00:15:19,293 --> 00:15:22,671
but, uh, weaponry isn't exactly
my area of expertise.

193
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:25,633
Well, my scans of this thing
showed organic components.

194
00:15:25,716 --> 00:15:28,969
And I figured anything biological
is more your turf than mine.

195
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:37,561
What do you think?

196
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:42,483
They appear to be generating
synaptic impulses.

197
00:15:50,157 --> 00:15:51,492
Is it alive?

198
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:59,083
Wouldn't make a very good pet, but...
( sniffs ) Definitely organic.

199
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:00,960
( squishing )

200
00:16:05,047 --> 00:16:07,967
And it seems to have
reproductive capabilities.

201
00:16:12,179 --> 00:16:15,099
The Kemocite is extremely refined.

202
00:16:15,182 --> 00:16:18,435
-Did it come from this facility?
-It did.

203
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:23,190
We supply many species with Kemocite,
not just Xindi.

204
00:16:23,273 --> 00:16:25,776
It has countless applications.

205
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:29,321
When Degra requested shipments
so highly refined,

206
00:16:29,405 --> 00:16:30,948
we celebrated,

207
00:16:31,031 --> 00:16:34,284
realizing the wealth it would bring
to our colony.

208
00:16:34,368 --> 00:16:37,788
We never considered why he
wanted such pure Kemocite.

209
00:16:37,871 --> 00:16:41,208
Perhaps our greed blinded us
from the possibility

210
00:16:41,291 --> 00:16:43,961
that it would be used
in constructing a weapon.

211
00:16:44,044 --> 00:16:48,924
-Is Degra a reptilian?
-No. He's a Xindi-primate.

212
00:16:50,426 --> 00:16:53,470
I met one at a mining complex.

213
00:16:53,554 --> 00:16:56,432
They're similar to you, apelike.

214
00:16:56,515 --> 00:17:00,728
Degra and his people have
always been fair, truthful.

215
00:17:00,811 --> 00:17:02,604
That may have been why I believed him

216
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:04,982
when he said the shipment
was for research.

217
00:17:05,065 --> 00:17:10,946
Perhaps they've become
as untrustworthy as the reptilians.

218
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:13,449
We've run into a few of them too.

219
00:17:14,783 --> 00:17:20,164
It's hard to imagine five sentient species
evolving on the same planet.

220
00:17:20,247 --> 00:17:21,790
Five?

221
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:24,793
Hmm... I suppose there are now.

222
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:30,049
-No, thanks.
-Do you mind?

223
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:31,592
No, go ahead.

224
00:17:36,847 --> 00:17:38,098
Mmm.

225
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:43,145
There was a sixth species, the avians.

226
00:17:43,228 --> 00:17:44,980
They've been gone since the war.

227
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:47,274
-Gone?
-Extinct.

228
00:17:47,357 --> 00:17:53,447
As far as I'm told, none of them fled
before our homeworld was destroyed.

229
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:56,784
We found some debris. How did it happen?

230
00:17:57,367 --> 00:17:59,661
The war went on for nearly 100 years.

231
00:18:00,245 --> 00:18:01,747
The sides changed.

232
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:04,249
Alliances were forged and then broken.

233
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:05,417
By the time it ended,

234
00:18:05,501 --> 00:18:09,129
I doubt any of the six species
remembered what started it.

235
00:18:09,546 --> 00:18:11,715
But everyone remembered what ended it.

236
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:16,261
As well as being unstable politically,

237
00:18:16,345 --> 00:18:20,724
our planet was even more
unstable geologically.

238
00:18:22,893 --> 00:18:26,271
In a final desperate act,

239
00:18:26,355 --> 00:18:30,609
the insectoids and reptilians
detonated massive explosions

240
00:18:30,692 --> 00:18:33,779
beneath the eight largest
seismic fissures.

241
00:18:36,615 --> 00:18:41,495
I'd like to think they didn't realize
how devastating the result would be.

242
00:18:47,835 --> 00:18:50,170
My grandfather lived there.

243
00:18:50,254 --> 00:18:51,755
He told me of places

244
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:56,051
where the sky was sometimes
filled with avians.

245
00:18:58,512 --> 00:19:00,055
Now they're gone.

246
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:07,604
The other five species did survive.

247
00:19:07,688 --> 00:19:11,942
From what I can tell, they don't all live
on remote colonies like this one.

248
00:19:12,025 --> 00:19:17,114
The descendants of those that escaped
are scattered across the expanse.

249
00:19:18,907 --> 00:19:23,328
Many live peaceful lives,
but obviously not all.

250
00:19:23,412 --> 00:19:25,205
-( door opens )
-HAYES: Captain.

251
00:19:25,956 --> 00:19:27,457
I'll be right back.

252
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:28,709
Sir.

253
00:19:32,504 --> 00:19:33,881
It's OK.

254
00:19:36,466 --> 00:19:38,093
The suppressors are in place.

255
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:41,096
The blast wave should be mostly
confined to the facility.

256
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:43,432
Sir, I noticed a lot of activity
down there.

257
00:19:43,515 --> 00:19:45,475
It seemed like something is going on.

258
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:47,269
( communicator beeps )

259
00:19:49,271 --> 00:19:50,647
Archer.

260
00:19:50,731 --> 00:19:53,609
T'POL: <i>Captain, we've detected a ship</i>
<i>approaching the planet.</i>

261
00:19:53,901 --> 00:19:57,613
<i>The hull configuration matches </i>
<i>the Xindi vessel that attacked us. </i>

262
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:01,450
Reptilians.

263
00:20:24,431 --> 00:20:26,058
Recognize anyone?

264
00:20:27,309 --> 00:20:29,144
( inaudible )

265
00:20:32,314 --> 00:20:35,734
The reptilians seem
rather upset about something.

266
00:20:52,793 --> 00:20:54,336
You got something?

267
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:57,673
I've been running scans
of the weapon's organic component.

268
00:20:57,756 --> 00:21:02,010
Its neural pathways appear to help
modulate the rifle's power output.

269
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:03,553
It's the most sophisticated example

270
00:21:03,637 --> 00:21:05,514
of biomechanical engineering
I've ever seen.

271
00:21:05,597 --> 00:21:07,891
-You said you had good news, Doc.
-Ah, yes.

272
00:21:08,392 --> 00:21:11,478
I've been attempting to break down
this creature's immune system.

273
00:21:12,229 --> 00:21:14,064
You're trying to make it sick?

274
00:21:14,147 --> 00:21:16,650
Mmm-hmm. However, it's proving
to be quite resilient.

275
00:21:16,733 --> 00:21:19,319
I've tried an array
of viruses and pathogens,

276
00:21:19,403 --> 00:21:20,779
but it's immune to all of them.

277
00:21:20,862 --> 00:21:24,992
Then I began exposing it
to various radioactive spectra.

278
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:28,912
A sustained burst of delta radiation.

279
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:36,378
If we rig up portable E.M. emitters,

280
00:21:36,461 --> 00:21:37,838
we could knock out reptilian weapons

281
00:21:37,921 --> 00:21:39,881
before any of them get a chance
to pull the trigger.

282
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:41,216
In theory.

283
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,510
Unfortunately, the amount
of radiation required

284
00:21:43,593 --> 00:21:46,596
would be extremely hazardous
to any humans in the area.

285
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,432
-It's still a place to start.
-Hmm...

286
00:21:48,515 --> 00:21:50,392
Great work, Doc. Keep at it.

287
00:21:50,475 --> 00:21:52,853
Oh, and, uh, Commander...

288
00:21:52,936 --> 00:21:56,398
I'd avoid exposing
any of the Xindi technology

289
00:21:56,481 --> 00:21:58,358
to omicron radiation.

290
00:21:59,067 --> 00:22:02,154
It seems to thrive on it, as you can see.

291
00:22:02,654 --> 00:22:05,073
-I'll keep that in mind.
-Hmm...

292
00:22:06,116 --> 00:22:07,617
They're ahead of schedule.

293
00:22:07,701 --> 00:22:10,495
We weren't expecting them
for another three days.

294
00:22:10,579 --> 00:22:13,790
You might not have much time left
to accomplish your mission.

295
00:22:13,874 --> 00:22:15,542
What makes you say that?

296
00:22:15,625 --> 00:22:19,588
We've been processing Kemocite for them
for nearly six months.

297
00:22:19,671 --> 00:22:23,133
They're here for their final shipment.

298
00:22:23,216 --> 00:22:27,220
Captain, I'm the primary technician
at this facility.

299
00:22:27,304 --> 00:22:30,140
They'll want to talk to me
before accepting delivery,

300
00:22:30,223 --> 00:22:33,769
to confirm that all of their
technical requirements have been met.

301
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:40,484
I may be able to obtain
some information for you

302
00:22:40,567 --> 00:22:42,486
about this weapon.

303
00:22:44,071 --> 00:22:47,199
That could be dangerous.

304
00:22:47,282 --> 00:22:49,076
I'm willing to take that risk.

305
00:22:54,289 --> 00:22:58,251
How do I know you won't expose us,
tell them about <i>Enterprise?</i>

306
00:22:58,335 --> 00:23:02,130
I'm proud of my craft, Captain.

307
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:05,258
I've practiced it for many years.

308
00:23:05,342 --> 00:23:09,721
I won't let my work be corrupted
in this way.

309
00:23:09,805 --> 00:23:13,767
Seven million people.

310
00:23:15,185 --> 00:23:19,064
If I'd chosen my clients more carefully,

311
00:23:19,147 --> 00:23:21,942
that tragedy might not have happened.

312
00:23:23,026 --> 00:23:26,321
I don't intend to let it happen again.

313
00:23:27,739 --> 00:23:29,116
( communicator beeps )

314
00:23:32,452 --> 00:23:33,578
Archer.

315
00:23:33,662 --> 00:23:36,456
MALCOLM: <i>Captain, there are two </i>
<i>Xindi bio-signs heading this way.</i>

316
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:55,934
XINDI MALE: Gralik, are you there?

317
00:23:58,436 --> 00:23:59,646
Gralik?

318
00:24:00,981 --> 00:24:02,357
( door chimes )

319
00:24:22,794 --> 00:24:24,921
Degra's probably wondering where I am.

320
00:24:25,005 --> 00:24:27,799
His companions don't like
to be kept waiting.

321
00:24:27,883 --> 00:24:28,884
( knock on door )

322
00:24:31,344 --> 00:24:32,804
MALCOLM: Captain.

323
00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:36,808
They've gone.

324
00:24:36,892 --> 00:24:39,936
They'll return,
probably with armed reptilians.

325
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:42,272
Just because you didn't show up for work?

326
00:24:42,355 --> 00:24:45,025
There are fewer than 100 people
on this planet.

327
00:24:45,108 --> 00:24:48,069
It doesn't go unnoticed
when one of them is missing.

328
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:51,072
Degra won't leave until he sees

329
00:24:51,156 --> 00:24:54,409
the results
of the final isotopic analysis.

330
00:24:54,492 --> 00:24:56,745
You should reconsider my offer.

331
00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:01,875
TUCKER: That's good, right there.

332
00:25:02,584 --> 00:25:04,002
Are you sure this is wise?

333
00:25:04,085 --> 00:25:05,921
That's four inches of solid duranium.

334
00:25:06,004 --> 00:25:07,797
If this thing can blast a hole through it,

335
00:25:07,881 --> 00:25:09,716
then we're in even worse trouble
than we thought.

336
00:25:09,799 --> 00:25:13,803
Still, it might be prudent to find
a more suitable environment to test it.

337
00:25:13,887 --> 00:25:16,264
We don't have time to go looking
for some deserted asteroid,

338
00:25:16,348 --> 00:25:17,515
if that's what you mean.

339
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:20,018
If I may, Commander Tucker and I
have learned all we can

340
00:25:20,101 --> 00:25:21,811
from examining the workings of the device.

341
00:25:21,895 --> 00:25:24,731
A practical test is the next logical step.

342
00:25:25,523 --> 00:25:28,276
I've rigged up four of Malcolm's
force-field emitters.

343
00:25:30,695 --> 00:25:32,614
They'll contain any blast debris.

344
00:25:32,697 --> 00:25:35,659
What about radiation
or particle disbursement?

345
00:25:35,742 --> 00:25:38,495
-You know nothing about this device.
-That's the point.

346
00:25:38,578 --> 00:25:40,538
Those Xindi took out
half of our security force

347
00:25:40,622 --> 00:25:41,957
when they came aboard.

348
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:43,375
Now, if we don't start
making some progress

349
00:25:43,458 --> 00:25:44,793
understanding their weapons,

350
00:25:44,876 --> 00:25:48,171
we won't stand a chance in hell
of beating them when the time comes.

351
00:25:53,343 --> 00:25:55,345
Let me know when you're ready.

352
00:25:55,428 --> 00:25:56,930
Give us an hour.

353
00:26:09,609 --> 00:26:11,319
More delays?

354
00:26:11,403 --> 00:26:13,571
We did surprise them by arriving early.

355
00:26:13,655 --> 00:26:15,282
That's no excuse.

356
00:26:15,365 --> 00:26:18,326
They should have been ready by now.

357
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:20,370
Such lethargic creatures.

358
00:26:21,538 --> 00:26:23,999
You could learn something from them...

359
00:26:24,082 --> 00:26:25,709
Patience, for example.

360
00:26:25,792 --> 00:26:27,210
( hisses )

361
00:26:28,044 --> 00:26:29,629
Where's Gralik?

362
00:26:29,713 --> 00:26:31,256
We can't find him.

363
00:26:31,548 --> 00:26:34,551
In a complex this size,
how difficult could it be?

364
00:26:34,634 --> 00:26:37,304
We've searched everywhere.
No one's seen him.

365
00:26:37,387 --> 00:26:39,514
He often takes walks
outside the settlement.

366
00:26:39,597 --> 00:26:40,890
Walks?

367
00:26:41,141 --> 00:26:43,351
Without his analysis, I can't proceed.

368
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:45,103
We've organized search teams.

369
00:26:45,186 --> 00:26:49,107
We don't have time for you to go
foraging through the forest.

370
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:51,234
We'll find him ourselves.

371
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:08,418
( scanner beeping )

372
00:27:08,501 --> 00:27:09,836
What is it?

373
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:12,172
Someone's closing on our position, sir.

374
00:27:12,255 --> 00:27:13,340
400 meters.

375
00:27:13,423 --> 00:27:16,301
-Reptilians?
-I'm not certain.

376
00:27:16,384 --> 00:27:18,970
-350 meters.
-Stay with him.

377
00:27:24,351 --> 00:27:25,977
Still closing, sir.

378
00:27:26,895 --> 00:27:29,689
200 meters. 150.

379
00:27:29,773 --> 00:27:31,358
They're bloody fast, whoever they are.

380
00:27:36,154 --> 00:27:37,155
Take cover!

381
00:28:13,483 --> 00:28:15,318
( electricity buzzing )

382
00:28:17,112 --> 00:28:21,199
It's a seeker. The reptilians
built them for reconnaissance.

383
00:28:21,282 --> 00:28:24,786
They were used to great effect
during the war.

384
00:28:24,869 --> 00:28:27,789
It seems as though you may have
been exposed after all.

385
00:28:30,792 --> 00:28:32,502
Let's hope they didn't get
a very good look at us.

386
00:28:32,585 --> 00:28:34,838
There are some caves not far ahead.

387
00:28:34,921 --> 00:28:39,718
They should provide us with cover
in case we encounter any more of those.

388
00:28:54,482 --> 00:28:57,152
-Ready, Doc?
-Ready.

389
00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:03,074
( weapon clicks )

390
00:29:07,912 --> 00:29:10,373
-What's wrong?
-It won't fire.

391
00:29:10,457 --> 00:29:11,750
I don't understand.

392
00:29:11,833 --> 00:29:13,460
Perhaps it has a safety device.

393
00:29:13,543 --> 00:29:14,627
( beeping )

394
00:29:14,711 --> 00:29:17,297
-What's that?
-It's coming from the weapon.

395
00:29:19,883 --> 00:29:21,426
Looks like some kind of countdown.

396
00:29:23,344 --> 00:29:25,513
The energy levels are increasing.

397
00:29:26,723 --> 00:29:27,891
It's overloading.

398
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:30,977
I can't shut it down.
Damn thing's booby-trapped.

399
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:33,646
-If you remove the power cell...
-It'll just grow back.

400
00:29:44,491 --> 00:29:46,326
( groans )

401
00:30:01,966 --> 00:30:03,218
( sighs )

402
00:30:06,304 --> 00:30:07,847
Quick thinking, Commander.

403
00:30:07,931 --> 00:30:09,390
You were right.

404
00:30:09,474 --> 00:30:13,478
We probably should have found a nice,
empty asteroid to test it on.

405
00:30:20,735 --> 00:30:24,239
The Xindi ship is still in orbit.
We haven't detected any other vessels.

406
00:30:24,322 --> 00:30:25,865
Understood.

407
00:30:25,949 --> 00:30:28,743
<i>Captain, if the Xindi </i>
<i>have detected your presence,</i>

408
00:30:28,827 --> 00:30:31,162
I strongly urge you to return to the ship.

409
00:30:31,246 --> 00:30:32,705
ARCHER: <i>I appreciate your concern.</i>

410
00:30:32,789 --> 00:30:36,000
But we still have a few loose ends
to tie up down here.

411
00:30:36,084 --> 00:30:37,460
Archer out.

412
00:30:39,546 --> 00:30:42,590
-Anything?
-No, sir.

413
00:30:42,674 --> 00:30:44,342
We just might have stopped
those bloodhounds

414
00:30:44,425 --> 00:30:46,511
before they transmitted our position.

415
00:30:48,137 --> 00:30:49,430
Let's hope so.

416
00:30:54,936 --> 00:30:56,855
No sign of the reptilians.

417
00:30:56,938 --> 00:30:59,399
I doubt they'll find us.

418
00:30:59,482 --> 00:31:02,110
That's topaline ore.

419
00:31:02,193 --> 00:31:04,445
It should disrupt their scanners.

420
00:31:04,529 --> 00:31:07,365
Even their seekers won't locate us here.

421
00:31:12,036 --> 00:31:14,706
What do you intend to do now, Captain?

422
00:31:16,207 --> 00:31:18,626
Destroy our facility?

423
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:21,546
Do you plan to wait until I'm back inside,

424
00:31:21,629 --> 00:31:25,800
or will you simply dispose of me
here in the forest?

425
00:31:27,594 --> 00:31:32,724
-I've been considering another option.
-I'd certainly like to hear it.

426
00:31:34,809 --> 00:31:36,728
The people on this colony
had nothing to do

427
00:31:36,811 --> 00:31:38,938
with the attack on my planet.

428
00:31:41,065 --> 00:31:43,192
I'll be damned if I'm gonna
make them pay for it.

429
00:31:46,029 --> 00:31:49,407
You offered to help us.
Are you still willing?

430
00:31:52,035 --> 00:31:54,287
If you're prepared to trust me.

431
00:31:59,876 --> 00:32:04,130
Then we'll give them their Kemocite,

432
00:32:04,213 --> 00:32:07,216
but it won't be exactly what they ordered.

433
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:16,809
-Make sure he gets home safely.
-Yes, sir.

434
00:32:20,855 --> 00:32:23,274
It would be better if I went alone.

435
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:34,911
Good luck.

436
00:32:38,206 --> 00:32:39,374
And you.

437
00:32:44,295 --> 00:32:47,173
-MALCOLM: Permission to speak freely.
-Go ahead.

438
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:51,886
I'm not sure it was wise to let him go.

439
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:53,972
He could lead the reptilians back here.

440
00:32:54,055 --> 00:32:56,057
Are you speaking freely as well, Major?

441
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:59,268
-Just offering a tactical assessment, sir.
-Noted.

442
00:33:01,896 --> 00:33:03,439
He said he'd help us.

443
00:33:05,066 --> 00:33:06,317
I believe him.

444
00:33:07,276 --> 00:33:08,277
( computer beeps )

445
00:33:08,361 --> 00:33:10,571
It's the captain.

446
00:33:10,655 --> 00:33:12,073
Go ahead, sir.

447
00:33:12,156 --> 00:33:14,617
ARCHER: <i>Tell the armory </i>
<i>to hold off on those spatial charges.</i>

448
00:33:14,701 --> 00:33:16,119
<i>There's been a change of plans.</i>

449
00:33:16,202 --> 00:33:20,164
-Is everything all right?
-I'll let you know in a couple of hours.

450
00:33:20,248 --> 00:33:22,834
Right now,
I have an assignment for you and Hoshi.

451
00:33:37,056 --> 00:33:38,474
They're looking for you.

452
00:33:38,558 --> 00:33:40,560
Have you started loading the shipment?

453
00:33:40,643 --> 00:33:42,437
-Not yet.
-Good.

454
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:45,606
I want to run another refinement test.

455
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:47,400
We've completed three already.

456
00:33:47,483 --> 00:33:49,402
The impurities were
less than six parts per million.

457
00:33:49,485 --> 00:33:53,406
We have to be absolutely certain
that we've met their specifications.

458
00:33:53,489 --> 00:33:56,868
You know how important this is
to all of us.

459
00:33:56,951 --> 00:33:58,286
We should get started.

460
00:33:58,369 --> 00:34:02,749
You two perform the isotopic analysis.
I'll run the submolecular scans.

461
00:34:16,137 --> 00:34:17,847
We've got it.

462
00:34:17,930 --> 00:34:20,016
We've modified the radiolytic signature.

463
00:34:20,099 --> 00:34:22,643
If you can get it on board their ship,
I'll be able to track it.

464
00:34:22,727 --> 00:34:23,978
Understood.

465
00:34:40,495 --> 00:34:41,996
Where were you?

466
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:44,665
My personal activities
aren't your concern.

467
00:34:44,749 --> 00:34:48,628
And do your personal activities
involve destroying one of our seekers?

468
00:34:48,711 --> 00:34:50,963
I was hunting tree scarabs.

469
00:34:51,047 --> 00:34:52,965
Your drone was frightening them.

470
00:34:53,049 --> 00:34:54,634
Who was with you?

471
00:34:54,717 --> 00:34:57,512
I prefer to spend my time
in the forest alone.

472
00:34:57,595 --> 00:35:00,765
Our scans detected other bio-signs.

473
00:35:00,848 --> 00:35:01,974
I was alone.

474
00:35:02,058 --> 00:35:04,519
If you saw the drone,
you knew we were here.

475
00:35:04,602 --> 00:35:06,312
Why didn't you return?

476
00:35:06,395 --> 00:35:08,022
You're two days early.

477
00:35:09,357 --> 00:35:11,901
-What are you doing?
-Running some final tests.

478
00:35:11,984 --> 00:35:13,361
What kind of tests?

479
00:35:13,444 --> 00:35:14,987
We were told the shipment was ready.

480
00:35:16,781 --> 00:35:20,701
42 years. That's how long
I've been running this facility.

481
00:35:20,785 --> 00:35:24,122
And never once have I allowed
a single gram of Kemocite

482
00:35:24,205 --> 00:35:27,208
to leave the premises
unless it was perfectly calibrated.

483
00:35:27,291 --> 00:35:28,751
I take pride in my work,

484
00:35:28,835 --> 00:35:32,839
but if you're so eager to get underway,
then go ahead, take your shipment!

485
00:35:32,922 --> 00:35:34,340
But if it doesn't meet your requirements,

486
00:35:34,423 --> 00:35:37,552
don't expect me to produce
another 100 kilograms overnight,

487
00:35:37,635 --> 00:35:40,763
because we do have
other clients besides you.

488
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:45,393
Finish quickly.

489
00:36:10,126 --> 00:36:12,587
MALCOLM: There are two of them,
loading containers.

490
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:14,088
Stand by, Captain.

491
00:36:14,172 --> 00:36:15,631
Acknowledged.

492
00:36:19,635 --> 00:36:22,054
-MALCOLM: They're heading back.
-You're clear, sir.

493
00:36:56,881 --> 00:36:58,591
-( beep )
<i>-Reed to </i>Enterprise.

494
00:37:00,218 --> 00:37:01,552
Go ahead.

495
00:37:01,636 --> 00:37:04,347
MALCOLM:
<i>The Captain's inside the Xindi shuttle.</i>

496
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:05,765
Acknowledged.

497
00:37:40,299 --> 00:37:43,719
Captain, three Xindi have
just come out of the complex.

498
00:37:45,346 --> 00:37:46,639
Understood.

499
00:37:47,765 --> 00:37:49,392
Lieutenant Reed, report.

500
00:37:49,475 --> 00:37:52,937
MALCOLM: <i>We've run into a small problem. </i>
<i>Stand by.</i>

501
00:37:59,568 --> 00:38:01,112
We appreciate your efforts.

502
00:38:01,195 --> 00:38:03,447
Perhaps you'll need our services
in the future.

503
00:38:04,407 --> 00:38:05,408
Perhaps.

504
00:38:24,135 --> 00:38:26,721
I'll miss the pleasure of your company.

505
00:38:26,804 --> 00:38:28,681
We should go, Degra.

506
00:38:28,764 --> 00:38:30,474
We're behind schedule already.

507
00:38:30,725 --> 00:38:33,769
We've invested a great deal
in this project.

508
00:38:33,853 --> 00:38:35,479
And you've been well paid for it.

509
00:38:35,771 --> 00:38:37,315
Yes, you've been more than generous,

510
00:38:37,398 --> 00:38:42,695
but I'd appreciate if you could tell me
what this shipment is being used for.

511
00:38:50,161 --> 00:38:52,079
I don't think
it's an unreasonable request.

512
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:53,372
It doesn't concern you.

513
00:38:53,456 --> 00:38:55,666
It concerns all of us.

514
00:38:56,625 --> 00:38:59,086
We've learned
there's a threat to our people.

515
00:39:00,212 --> 00:39:01,589
What kind of threat?

516
00:39:01,964 --> 00:39:04,383
A ruthless alien species.

517
00:39:04,467 --> 00:39:06,635
If we don't act, they'll destroy us.

518
00:39:17,438 --> 00:39:19,273
I'm glad we could contribute.

519
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:21,525
Take pride in what you've done here.

520
00:39:35,373 --> 00:39:37,249
-( beep )
<i>-Archer to </i>Enterprise.

521
00:39:38,793 --> 00:39:40,086
Go ahead.

522
00:39:40,169 --> 00:39:42,129
<i>What's the status of that Xindi ship?</i>

523
00:39:42,213 --> 00:39:44,548
It broke orbit five minutes ago, Captain.

524
00:39:44,632 --> 00:39:46,342
<i>Are you picking up the tracking signal?</i>

525
00:39:46,425 --> 00:39:47,927
-( beeping )
-Loud and clear.

526
00:39:48,010 --> 00:39:51,263
<i>Keep an eye on it. </i>
<i>We'll be back as soon as we can.</i>

527
00:39:51,347 --> 00:39:52,890
Acknowledged.

528
00:40:01,816 --> 00:40:04,110
-Thank you.
-Mmm...

529
00:40:06,529 --> 00:40:08,364
Is something wrong?

530
00:40:13,744 --> 00:40:18,582
I may have just betrayed my people
to a ruthless alien species.

531
00:40:21,168 --> 00:40:23,295
I promise you, you haven't.

532
00:40:24,755 --> 00:40:26,173
Please trust me.

533
00:40:29,051 --> 00:40:30,094
To trust.

534
00:40:37,435 --> 00:40:42,398
Eventually, Degra's going to discover
that you sabotaged his Kemocite.

535
00:40:42,481 --> 00:40:45,693
( chuckles ) It should delay
their progress considerably.

536
00:40:45,776 --> 00:40:47,778
-They'll come back here.
-Don't worry.

537
00:40:47,862 --> 00:40:49,947
I can deal with Degra and his friends.

538
00:40:50,030 --> 00:40:52,825
You should just be concerned
with finding this weapon.

539
00:40:55,828 --> 00:40:59,832
Their ship entered an energy portal
after it left orbit.

540
00:41:00,791 --> 00:41:02,793
We've lost our tracking signal.

541
00:41:02,877 --> 00:41:06,714
The portal's range
is only a few light-years. Keep searching.

542
00:41:12,595 --> 00:41:14,388
I better get back to <i>Enterprise.</i>

543
00:41:16,515 --> 00:41:22,104
If everything you've told me is true
about the attack on your world,

544
00:41:23,105 --> 00:41:27,359
I hope you remember that
all Xindi are not your enemy.

545
00:41:28,819 --> 00:41:29,862
I will.
