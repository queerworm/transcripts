IN DANGER.

675
00:37:39,216 --> 00:37:41,384
RELEASE THAT HOSTAGE.

676
00:37:44,554 --> 00:37:47,140
RYAN: HE'S MY PRISONER,

677
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:48,767
AND I'M GOING TO HANDLE THIS
MY WAY.

678
00:37:48,767 --> 00:37:50,227
MAYWEATHER: WHAT ARE YOU GOING
TO DO, KILL HIM?

679
00:37:50,227 --> 00:37:52,395
RYAN: UGH. YOU AGAIN.

680
00:37:52,395 --> 00:37:55,190
MAYWEATHER: SIR,
WITH YOUR PERMISSION?

681
00:37:57,025 --> 00:37:59,903
YOU THINK KILLING ONE OF THEM
IS GOING TO ACCOMPLISH ANYTHING?

682
00:37:59,903 --> 00:38:01,571
RYAN: WHAT, DID
YOUR CAPTAIN DECIDE

683
00:38:01,571 --> 00:38:04,199
A LITTLE BOOMER-TO-BOOMER TALK
WOULD PERSUADE ME?

684
00:38:04,199 --> 00:38:05,784
MAYWEATHER:
JUST SHUT UP AND LISTEN TO ME.

685
00:38:05,784 --> 00:38:08,161
I DON'T GIVE A DAMN
ABOUT YOU ANYMORE.

686
00:38:08,161 --> 00:38:09,996
I'M JUST THINKING
ABOUT MY FAMILY.

687
00:38:09,996 --> 00:38:11,998
RYAN: WHAT HAVE THEY GOT TO DO
WITH THIS?

688
00:38:11,998 --> 00:38:15,627
MAYWEATHER: WHAT'S GOING TO
HAPPEN TO THE NEXT FREIGHTER

689
00:38:15,627 --> 00:38:18,296
THAT RUNS INTO THE NAUSICAANS?

690
00:38:18,296 --> 00:38:19,839
WHAT IF IT'S THE<i> HORIZON</i>

691
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:22,592
AND THEY HAVE TO PAY THE PRICE
FOR YOUR...

692
00:38:22,592 --> 00:38:24,219
STUBBORN STUPIDITY?

693
00:38:24,219 --> 00:38:25,344
RYAN: I'M DOING THIS FOR THEM.

694
00:38:25,344 --> 00:38:27,180
MAYWEATHER: THE HELL YOU ARE!

695
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:30,475
THIS ISN'T ABOUT PROTECTING
CARGO SHIPS.

696
00:38:30,475 --> 00:38:31,935
RYAN:
THAT IS JUST WHAT IT'S ABOUT.

697
00:38:31,935 --> 00:38:34,146
MAYWEATHER:
DON'T KID YOURSELF INTO THINKING

698
00:38:34,146 --> 00:38:36,689
YOU'RE DOING THIS
FOR SOME GREATER GOOD.

699
00:38:36,689 --> 00:38:40,652
THIS IS ABOUT REVENGE,
NOTHING ELSE.

700
00:38:40,652 --> 00:38:42,403
REED: THE NAUSICAAN SHIPS
ARE FIRING, SIR.

701
00:38:42,403 --> 00:38:44,239
[ IMPACT ]

702
00:38:44,239 --> 00:38:49,077
ARCHER: RETURN FIRE,
STARBOARD TUBES THREE AND FOUR.

703
00:38:49,077 --> 00:38:53,581
MAYWEATHER:
YOU DON'T LIKE ME BECAUSE I LEFT
THE<i> HORIZON</i> TO JOIN STARFLEET.

704
00:38:53,581 --> 00:38:55,875
YOU'RE AFRAID
THAT IF MORE PEOPLE DO THAT,

705
00:38:55,875 --> 00:38:58,711
THERE WON'T BE ANYONE LEFT
TO RUN THE FREIGHTERS.

706
00:38:58,711 --> 00:39:00,255
MAYBE YOU'RE RIGHT,

707
00:39:00,255 --> 00:39:01,464
MAYBE NOT,

708
00:39:01,464 --> 00:39:03,258
BUT IF YOU DON'T LET
YOUR HOSTAGE GO,

709
00:39:03,258 --> 00:39:07,345
THE NAUSICAANS ARE GOING
TO KILL YOU AND YOUR CREW...

710
00:39:10,307 --> 00:39:11,766
[ IMPACT ]

711
00:39:11,766 --> 00:39:14,978
ARCHER: PORT TUBES ONE AND TWO.
FIRE.

712
00:39:14,978 --> 00:39:18,315
MAYWEATHER: AND THEN THERE'LL BE
23 FEWER PEOPLE OUT HERE

713
00:39:18,315 --> 00:39:19,649
TO RUN THOSE FREIGHTERS.

714
00:39:19,649 --> 00:39:22,610
NO MAYBES.

715
00:39:29,408 --> 00:39:33,454
RYAN: HOLD YOUR FIRE!

716
00:39:33,454 --> 00:39:34,998
TAKE HIM!

717
00:40:12,077 --> 00:40:14,579
REED: THE NAUSICAANS ARE
POWERING DOWN THEIR WEAPONS.

718
00:40:14,579 --> 00:40:16,873
THEY'RE MOVING OFF, SIR.

719
00:40:45,318 --> 00:40:47,153
ARCHER: NEED A HAND?

720
00:40:47,153 --> 00:40:48,571
KEENE: [ CHUCKLES ]

721
00:40:48,571 --> 00:40:50,448
JUST A LITTLE STIFF.

722
00:40:50,448 --> 00:40:53,326
THANK YOUR DOCTOR FOR ME.

723
00:40:53,326 --> 00:40:57,038
I'VE GOT SOME DRAYLAXIAN WHISKEY
STASHED AWAY...

724
00:40:57,038 --> 00:40:58,373
IF YOU'D LIKE TO JOIN ME.

725
00:40:58,373 --> 00:41:00,666
ARCHER: I'M ON DUTY.

726
00:41:02,127 --> 00:41:03,711
KEENE: TOO BAD.

727
00:41:03,711 --> 00:41:05,797
IF YOU'VE NEVER HAD IT,

728
00:41:05,797 --> 00:41:09,301
YOU'RE MISSING ONE OF
THE GALAXY'S REAL PLEASURES.

729
00:41:09,301 --> 00:41:13,763
I'M REDUCING MR. RYAN'S RANK
TO ABLE CREWMAN.

730
00:41:13,763 --> 00:41:16,682
HE GETS TO SPEND THE REST
OF THE TRIP

731
00:41:16,682 --> 00:41:18,977
PURGING HYDRAULIC PUMPS.

732
00:41:18,977 --> 00:41:21,438
ARCHER: IF YOU THINK HE'S GOING
TO BE A PROBLEM,

733
00:41:21,438 --> 00:41:22,939
WE COULD TAKE HIM BACK TO EARTH.

734
00:41:22,939 --> 00:41:25,483
KEENE: NO. WE TAKE CARE
OF OUR OWN.

735
00:41:25,483 --> 00:41:29,446
BESIDES, THAT WOULD LEAVE ME
A MAN SHORT.

736
00:41:29,446 --> 00:41:32,365
ARCHER: UNDERSTOOD.

737
00:41:32,365 --> 00:41:34,742
KEENE:
I MADE HIM MY FIRST OFFICER

738
00:41:34,742 --> 00:41:37,329
BECAUSE I TRUSTED HIM
WITH MY SHIP.

739
00:41:37,329 --> 00:41:40,498
IT'S GOING TO TAKE HIM
QUITE A WHILE TO EARN THAT BACK.

740
00:41:40,498 --> 00:41:42,334
ARCHER:
HIS INTENTIONS WERE GOOD,

741
00:41:42,334 --> 00:41:47,255
BUT SOMEONE SHOULD TEACH HIM TO
ACCEPT HELP WHEN IT'S OFFERED.

742
00:41:49,048 --> 00:41:51,592
KEENE:
THE ONES THAT GREW UP OUT HERE

743
00:41:51,592 --> 00:41:54,679
FEEL THEY HAVE
SOME SPECIAL CLAIM,

744
00:41:54,679 --> 00:41:57,349
THAT THIS PARTICULAR STRETCH
OF SPACE IS THEIRS.

745
00:41:57,349 --> 00:41:58,557
IF THEY SEE ANOTHER SHIP

746
00:41:58,557 --> 00:42:02,270
WITHIN 10 LIGHT-YEARS,
THEY GET JUMPY.

747
00:42:02,270 --> 00:42:05,523
ARCHER: THEY'RE GOING TO BE
SEEING A LOT MORE SHIPS
THAN THEY'RE USED TO.

748
00:42:07,484 --> 00:42:09,610
KEENE: THE SHIPS GET FASTER.

749
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:11,946
THAT'S PROGRESS, I SUPPOSE.

750
00:42:11,946 --> 00:42:14,491
MY FAMILY'S BEEN
ON THE<i> FORTUNATE</i>

751
00:42:14,491 --> 00:42:16,034
FOR THREE GENERATIONS.

752
00:42:16,034 --> 00:42:18,870
NOW I'M GOING TO NEED
AT LEAST A WARP 3 ENGINE

753
00:42:18,870 --> 00:42:20,413
TO STAY IN BUSINESS.

754
00:42:20,413 --> 00:42:22,707
ARCHER:
MAYBE THAT'S NOT SO BAD.

755
00:42:22,707 --> 00:42:26,461
AT WARP 3, HELP'S A LOT CLOSER
THAN BEFORE.

756
00:42:26,461 --> 00:42:28,129
YOU WON'T HAVE TO GO IT ALONE.

757
00:42:28,129 --> 00:42:30,882
KEENE: GOING IT ALONE'S
ALL WE'VE EVER DONE.

758
00:42:30,882 --> 00:42:32,633
FOR SOME OF US...

759
00:42:32,633 --> 00:42:35,470
IT'S THE REASON
WE'RE OUT HERE --

760
00:42:35,470 --> 00:42:38,097
A CHANCE TO PROVE OURSELVES.

761
00:42:38,097 --> 00:42:40,599
ARCHER: I THINK
YOU'VE ALREADY DONE THAT.

762
00:42:40,599 --> 00:42:44,437
KEENE: WELL...WE'LL ADAPT.

763
00:42:44,437 --> 00:42:45,813
WE ALWAYS HAVE.

764
00:42:45,813 --> 00:42:49,359
BUT THINGS JUST...
WON'T BE THE SAME.

765
00:42:51,652 --> 00:42:53,321
ARCHER: GOOD LUCK.

766
00:42:57,116 --> 00:42:59,536
KEENE: SURE YOU WON'T
JOIN ME FOR THAT DRINK?

767
00:42:59,536 --> 00:43:01,079
ARCHER: [ CHUCKLES ]

768
00:43:01,079 --> 00:43:04,665
THANKS, BUT...MY CREW'S ANXIOUS
TO GET UNDER WAY.

769
00:43:04,665 --> 00:43:06,584
NEXT TIME.
