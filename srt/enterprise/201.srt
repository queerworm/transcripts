[EXPLOSIONS]

00:00:04,254 --> 00:00:06,465
ARCHER:<i> LAST TIME</i>
<i>ON</i> "ENTERPRISE"...

3
00:00:06,465 --> 00:00:08,216
HOSHI: THERE'S NOTHING LEFT.

4
00:00:08,216 --> 00:00:10,260
NO BUILDINGS, NO TREES,
NO PEOPLE.

5
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:11,971
ARCHER: THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

6
00:00:11,971 --> 00:00:13,764
THERE WERE 3,600 COLONISTS.

7
00:00:13,764 --> 00:00:15,766
THE MISSION'S BEEN CANCELED.

8
00:00:15,766 --> 00:00:17,810
TUCKER: I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'RE
LETTING THEM DO THIS TO US.

9
00:00:17,810 --> 00:00:20,813
YOU'VE WAITED ALL YOUR LIFE
TO COMMAND THIS SHIP.

10
00:00:20,813 --> 00:00:23,983
DANIELS: HISTORY NEVER
RECORDED THE DISASTER.

11
00:00:23,983 --> 00:00:26,151
SOMEONE
VIOLATED THE TEMPORAL ACCORD,

12
00:00:26,151 --> 00:00:28,278
SOMEONE WHO DOESN'T
WANT YOUR MISSION TO SUCCEED.

13
00:00:28,278 --> 00:00:29,905
ARE YOU TELLING ME
THAT "ENTERPRISE"

14
00:00:29,905 --> 00:00:31,532
DIDN'T CAUSE THAT EXPLOSION?

15
00:00:31,532 --> 00:00:34,075
HE BROUGHT ME BACK 10 MONTHS.

16
00:00:34,075 --> 00:00:35,327
BUT I KNEW EVERYTHING
I KNOW NOW.

17
00:00:35,327 --> 00:00:37,037
HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE?

18
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:38,998
THE SULIBAN DESTROYED
THAT COLONY.

19
00:00:38,998 --> 00:00:40,875
WE'RE GOING BACK TO GET PROOF.

20
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:51,844
FUTURE MAN:<i> HAVE YOUR</i>
<i>SHIPS BRING ME ARCHER.</i>

21
00:00:54,555 --> 00:00:57,766
T'POL: CAPTAIN ARCHER
IS NO LONGER ABOARD<i> ENTERPRISE.</i>

22
00:00:57,766 --> 00:01:00,227
<i>I THOUGHT HE WAS SMARTER</i>
<i>THAN THIS.</i>

23
00:01:00,227 --> 00:01:02,229
<i>HE COULD HAVE SAVED</i>
<i>ALL YOUR LIVES.</i>

24
00:01:02,229 --> 00:01:04,439
IT'S TARGETING OUR WARP CORE.

25
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:07,442
DANIELS: YOU'RE IN THE 31st
CENTURY, CAPTAIN.

26
00:01:07,442 --> 00:01:10,905
ARCHER: IF BRINGING ME HERE
CAUSED THIS, THEN SEND ME BACK.

27
00:01:10,905 --> 00:01:14,115
I'LL TAKE MY CHANCES WITH SILIK.

28
00:01:14,115 --> 00:01:16,201
DANIELS: Y-YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

29
00:01:16,201 --> 00:01:18,913
THE TIME PORTALS--

30
00:01:18,913 --> 00:01:21,081
THEY'VE BEEN DESTROYED.

31
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:23,208
EVERYTHING'S BEEN DESTROYED.

32
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:26,211
THERE'S NO WAY
TO SEND YOU BACK.

33
00:01:26,211 --> 00:01:28,380
<i>ARCHER: AND NOW THE CONCLUSION.</i>

34
00:01:36,388 --> 00:01:39,808
HE'S NOT ONBOARD.

35
00:01:39,808 --> 00:01:42,686
YOU MUST HAVE SENSORS
THAT CAN CONFIRM THAT.

36
00:01:42,686 --> 00:01:44,479
<i>YOU'VE LIED TO ME BEFORE.</i>

37
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:45,940
<i>IF YOU DON'T TELL ME</i>
<i>WHERE HE IS,</i>

38
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:47,733
<i>I'LL HAVE NO ALTERNATIVE</i>
<i>BUT TO--</i>

39
00:01:47,733 --> 00:01:50,611
COME SEE FOR YOURSELF
OR SEND YOUR SOLDIERS.

40
00:01:50,611 --> 00:01:53,739
YOU'LL REALIZE
I'M TELLING THE TRUTH.

41
00:01:53,739 --> 00:01:57,743
<i>DROP OUT OF WARP</i>
<i>AND PREPARE TO BE BOARDED.</i>

T'POL:
THIS IS SUBCOMMANDER T'POL.

44
00:02:02,581 --> 00:02:05,375
ALL SECURITY TEAMS REMAIN
WHERE YOU ARE.

45
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:06,919
TUCKER: ARE YOU CRAZY?

46
00:02:06,919 --> 00:02:09,212
HOW DO WE KNOW HOW MANY SULIBAN
ARE COMING ABOARD?

47
00:02:09,212 --> 00:02:10,965
THEY COULD TRY
TO TAKE OVER THE SHIP.

48
00:02:10,965 --> 00:02:12,841
THERE ARE 30 ARMED VESSELS
SURROUNDING US.

49
00:02:12,841 --> 00:02:14,468
UNLESS I'M MISTAKEN,

50
00:02:14,468 --> 00:02:17,054
THEIR WEAPONS ARE STILL
TARGETING OUR WARP CORE.

51
00:02:17,054 --> 00:02:18,305

00:04:05,412 --> 00:04:08,289
AS LONG AGO
AS IT SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN,

75
00:04:08,289 --> 00:04:10,125
THEN WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

76
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:12,460
YOU AND YOUR WATCHDOG BUDDIES

77
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:14,046
DON'T EXACTLY
FIT IN WITH ALL THIS.

78
00:04:14,046 --> 00:04:15,463
DANIELS: YOU'RE THINKING
OF TIME TRAVEL

79
00:04:15,463 --> 00:04:17,049
LIKE WE'RE IN SOME
H.G. WELLS NOVEL.

80
00:04:17,049 --> 00:04:19,300
WE'RE NOT.
IT'S FAR MORE COMPLICATED.

81
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:21,011
THERE'S NO WAY FOR YOU
TO UNDERSTAND.

82
00:04:21,011 --> 00:04:22,637
ARCHER: TRY ME.

83
00:04:24,305 --> 00:04:27,475
LISTEN, I REALIZE
YOUR LITTLE UTOPIA IS GONE,

84
00:04:27,475 --> 00:04:29,686
AND I SYMPATHIZE,

85
00:04:29,686 --> 00:04:32,022
BUT IF YOU'RE TELLING ME
THE TRUTH,

86
00:04:32,022 --> 00:04:34,399
IF YOU'VE BROUGHT ME 800 YEARS
INTO THE FUTURE--

87
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:37,527
INTO THIS FUTURE--
I THINK I DESERVE SOME ANSWERS.

88
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:40,155
DANIELS: I DON'T
HAVE ANY ANSWERS.

89
00:04:40,155 --> 00:04:41,364
AND YOU'RE RIGHT.

90
00:04:41,364 --> 00:04:42,783
I SHOULDN'T BE HERE,

91
00:04:42,783 --> 00:04:44,201
WHICH MEANS YOU SHOULDN'T
BE HERE, EITHER,

92
00:04:44,201 --> 00:04:46,494
BUT YOU ARE.

93
00:04:46,494 --> 00:04:48,329
WE ARE.

94
00:04:48,329 --> 00:04:49,790
[LAUGHS]

95
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:53,168
WE BROUGHT YOU HERE
TO PROTECT THE TIMELINE.

96
00:04:53,168 --> 00:04:54,377
[LAUGHS]

97
00:04:54,377 --> 00:04:56,296
WE DID QUITE A JOB.

98
00:05:00,634 --> 00:05:02,552
ARCHER: WHAT'S WRONG?

99
00:05:02,552 --> 00:05:05,430
DANIELS: IT'S GONE.

100
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:07,057
ARCHER: WHAT'S GONE?

101
00:05:07,057 --> 00:05:08,892
DANIELS: THE MONUMENT.

102
00:05:08,892 --> 00:05:10,560
IT WAS RIGHT HERE,

103
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,773
ON THE SAME STREET
AS THE LIBRARY.

104
00:05:14,773 --> 00:05:16,733
IT WAS OBVIOUSLY
NEVER BUILT.

105
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:18,526
ARCHER: WHY IS THAT A PROBLEM?

106
00:05:24,074 --> 00:05:25,659
WHO DID IT COMMEMORATE?

107
00:05:25,659 --> 00:05:27,661
DANIELS: NOT WHO.
ARCHER: THEN WHAT?

108
00:05:27,661 --> 00:05:29,454
DANIELS: AN ORGANIZATION.

109
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:31,165
A FEDERATION.

110
00:05:31,165 --> 00:05:33,625
IT DOESN'T EXIST FOR YOU,
NOT--NOT YET.

111
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:35,502
ARCHER: BUT IT WILL?

112
00:05:40,257 --> 00:05:41,842
FINE.

113
00:05:41,842 --> 00:05:44,928
KEEP YOUR MISSING
MONUMENT TO YOURSELF.

114
00:05:44,928 --> 00:05:47,681
WHERE'S THIS LIBRARY
YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT?

115
00:05:47,681 --> 00:05:49,891
DANIELS: UH, IT SHOULD
BE RIGHT DOWN THERE,

116
00:05:49,891 --> 00:05:51,434
IF IT WAS EVER BUILT.

117
00:05:51,434 --> 00:05:53,478
AND EVEN IF IT WAS,
IT WILL BE OF NO HELP.

118
00:05:53,478 --> 00:05:55,189
ALL THE DATA IS STORED
ELECTRONICALLY.

119
00:06:12,956 --> 00:06:16,751
DANIELS: BOOKS
MADE WITH PAPER.

120
00:06:16,751 --> 00:06:20,839
THERE AREN'T SUPPOSED
TO BE BOOKS HERE.

121
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:22,549
ARCHER: WELL, THERE ARE.

122
00:06:22,549 --> 00:06:24,259
SO I SUGGEST
WE USE SOME OF THEM

123
00:06:24,259 --> 00:06:26,803
TO FIGURE OUT WHAT YOU DID
TO THE LAST THOUSAND YEARS

124
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:28,555
WHEN YOU BROUGHT ME HERE
THIS MORNING.

125
00:07:06,968 --> 00:07:08,970
THEY HAVEN'T
BEEN DUPLICATED.

126
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:10,471
SILIK: IS HE CORRECT?

127
00:07:10,471 --> 00:07:12,515
T'POL: DON'T YOU BELIEVE
YOUR SCANNERS?

128
00:07:12,515 --> 00:07:14,101
SILIK: IS HE CORRECT?

129
00:07:14,101 --> 00:07:16,395
HOSHI: WE DIDN'T HAVE
TIME TO MAKE A COPY.

130
00:07:16,395 --> 00:07:17,812
TUCKER: LEAVE HER ALONE!

131
00:07:20,565 --> 00:07:23,318
SILIK: LOWER YOUR WEAPON.

132
00:07:23,318 --> 00:07:27,406
IF WE FIND CAPTAIN ARCHER
ABOARD THIS VESSEL,

133
00:07:27,406 --> 00:07:31,410
YOU'LL ALL BE...
PUNISHED FOR LYING TO ME.

134
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:34,579
ALIEN: HE'S NOT HERE
UNLESS HE'S DEAD.

135
00:07:34,579 --> 00:07:36,039
BUT WE DID FIND THIS.

136
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:42,503
SILIK: WHERE?
ALIEN: IN THAT LIFT.

137
00:07:42,503 --> 00:07:44,172
IT'S AN HOUR OLD, MAYBE TWO.

138
00:07:46,758 --> 00:07:50,345
SILIK: WHEN I SAW HIM LAST,
YOUR CAPTAIN SPOKE

139
00:07:50,345 --> 00:07:53,223
OF A TEMPORAL COLD WAR.

140
00:07:53,223 --> 00:07:54,975
WHAT WAS HE TALKING ABOUT?

141
00:07:54,975 --> 00:07:56,684
T'POL: CAPTAIN ARCHER BELIEVED

142
00:07:56,684 --> 00:07:58,312
CREWMAN DANIELS WAS
FROM THE FUTURE.

143
00:07:58,312 --> 00:08:01,022
BUT IF I RECALL,
YOU KILLED HIM.

144
00:08:01,022 --> 00:08:02,565
SILIK: WHAT ELSE?

145
00:08:02,565 --> 00:08:05,735
T'POL: NOTHING ELSE.

146
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:09,030
SILIK: THERE'S A TEMPORAL
SIGNATURE IN YOUR TURBOLIFT.

147
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:10,907
WHAT DO YOU KNOW OF THAT?

148
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:12,617
T'POL: THE LAST TIME
WE SAW CAPTAIN ARCHER,

149
00:08:12,617 --> 00:08:14,453
HE WAS ENTERING THAT TURBOLIFT.

150
00:08:16,537 --> 00:08:20,208
SILIK: PERHAPS YOU HAVEN'T
BEEN LYING TO ME.

151
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:23,462
YOU, SHUT DOWN ALL COM SYSTEMS
AND COMPUTER TERMINALS

152
00:08:23,462 --> 00:08:26,506
WITH THE EXCEPTION
OF ENGINEERING AND THE BRIDGE.

153
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:28,133
CONFINE ALL OF THEM
TO THEIR QUARTERS.

154
00:08:28,133 --> 00:08:31,052
SILIK: IF ANYONE RESISTS--
ALIEN: UNDERSTOOD.

155
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:36,224
TUCKER: HEY!

156
00:08:36,224 --> 00:08:38,435
T'POL: UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES,

157
00:08:38,435 --> 00:08:40,687
IT WOULD BE BEST
TO DO WHAT HE SAYS, COMMANDER.

158
00:08:59,706 --> 00:09:01,333
THEY'RE 3 DAYS OVERDUE.

159
00:09:01,333 --> 00:09:02,876
FORREST: I TOLD YOU, AMBASSADOR,

160
00:09:02,876 --> 00:09:05,170
ARCHER SAID
HE WAS RETURNING WITH PROOF

161
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:07,422
THAT THEY WEREN'T RESPONSIBLE
FOR THE TRAGEDY ON PARAAGAN II.

162
00:09:07,422 --> 00:09:09,841
YOU ALSO TOLD ME
STARFLEET HAD ORDERED HIM

163
00:09:09,841 --> 00:09:13,428
TO DELIVER SUBCOMMANDER T'POL
AND HIS MEDICAL OFFICER

164
00:09:13,428 --> 00:09:15,138
TO THE VULCAN SHIP "D'KYR."

165
00:09:15,138 --> 00:09:17,474
THEY'RE 3 DAYS OVERDUE.

166
00:09:17,474 --> 00:09:19,893
WILLIAMS: THE "D'KYR" HAS
LONG-RANGE SENSORS.

167
00:09:19,893 --> 00:09:22,145
HAVE THEY DETECTED "ENTERPRISE"?

168
00:09:22,145 --> 00:09:25,899
SOVAL: CAPTAIN ARCHER'S
NEGLIGENCE CAUSED THE DEATH

169
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:28,109
OF 3,000 COLONISTS.

170
00:09:28,109 --> 00:09:31,112
YOUR SUPERIORS INSTRUCTED THEM
TO RETURN TO EARTH.

171
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:32,780
THEIR MISSION IS OVER.

172
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:34,408
THEY HAVEN'T FOLLOWED
THOSE INSTRUCTIONS.

173
00:09:34,408 --> 00:09:36,368
FORREST: YOU DIDN'T ANSWER
THE COMMANDER'S QUESTION.

174
00:09:38,286 --> 00:09:40,163
HAS YOUR SHIP
DETECTED "ENTERPRISE"?

175
00:09:41,998 --> 00:09:43,917
SOVAL: THE "D'KYR" SAID
THEY WERE JOINED

176
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:45,668
BY A NUMBER OF OTHER VESSELS.

177
00:09:45,668 --> 00:09:47,254
THEY'RE NO LONGER
WITHIN SENSOR RANGE.

178
00:09:47,254 --> 00:09:49,297
MAN: WHAT KIND OF VESSELS?

179
00:09:49,297 --> 00:09:52,675
SOVAL: THEY WERE AT TOO
GREAT A DISTANCE TO IDENTIFY.

180
00:09:52,675 --> 00:09:54,635
"ENTERPRISE" HAS
IGNORED OUR HAILS

181
00:09:54,635 --> 00:09:56,346
AND DEFIED STARFLEET'S ORDERS.

182
00:09:56,346 --> 00:10:00,225
I HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO SEND
THE "D'KYR" IN PURSUIT.

183
00:10:00,225 --> 00:10:02,310
FORREST: JONATHAN ARCHER
DOESN'T REPORT TO YOU.

184
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:03,978
SOVAL: NO, HE DOESN'T.

185
00:10:03,978 --> 00:10:06,064
BUT SUBCOMMANDER T'POL DOES.

186
00:10:06,064 --> 00:10:08,358
AND SINCE SHE WOULD NEVER COMPLY
WITH HIS PRESENT ACTIONS,

187
00:10:08,358 --> 00:10:11,194
I HAVE TO CONCLUDE THAT SHE'S
BEING HELD AGAINST HER WILL.

188
00:10:11,194 --> 00:10:14,114
MAN: I KNOW YOU DON'T THINK MUCH
OF ARCHER, AMBASSADOR,

189
00:10:14,114 --> 00:10:17,117
BUT HE IS NOT IN THE HABIT
OF KIDNAPPING VULCANS.

190
00:10:17,117 --> 00:10:21,121
FORREST: FINE.
YOU SEND YOUR SHIP.

191
00:10:21,121 --> 00:10:24,499
WHATEVER ARCHER'S UP TO, I'M
SURE HE'S GOT A GOOD REASON.

192
00:10:24,499 --> 00:10:26,960
HE KNOWS WHAT HE'S DOING.

193
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,587
SOVAL: DOES HE REALLY?

194
00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:42,683
ALIEN: HAVE YOU CYCLED THROUGH
THE SUB-TEMPORAL HARMONICS?

195
00:10:42,683 --> 00:10:45,353
SILIK: HE'S NEVER FAILED
TO RESPOND BEFORE.

196
00:10:45,353 --> 00:10:47,897
ALIEN: PERHAPS HE'S ANGRY THAT
WE DIDN'T RETURN WITH ARCHER.

197
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:49,774
SILIK: ARCHER WASN'T
ON "ENTERPRISE."

198
00:10:49,774 --> 00:10:53,194
WHY ISN'T HE RESPONDING?
I NEED INSTRUCTIONS.

199
00:10:53,194 --> 00:10:55,196
ALIEN: HE SAID TO
DESTROY "ENTERPRISE"

200
00:10:55,196 --> 00:10:58,199
IF WE COULDN'T
BRING HIM ARCHER.

201
00:10:58,199 --> 00:11:00,827
WE SHOULD TOW THEM OUT
OF THE NEBULA AND DO IT NOW.

202
00:11:00,827 --> 00:11:03,121
SILIK: THAT TEMPORAL SIGNATURE,
IT CHANGES EVERYTHING.

203
00:11:03,121 --> 00:11:04,789
IF ARCHER WAS PULLED
THROUGH TIME,

204
00:11:04,789 --> 00:11:06,541
WE NEED NEW INSTRUCTIONS.

205
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:08,376
WHERE IS HE?

206
00:11:08,376 --> 00:11:12,589
ALIEN: IF HE'S ANGRY WITH YOU,
YOU'LL BE PUNISHED AGAIN.

207
00:11:12,589 --> 00:11:14,633
WE SHOULD DESTROY "ENTERPRISE."

208

THE SURGEONS PREPARE.

209
00:11:19,596 --> 00:11:21,473
THEN BRING ME THE VULCAN.

210
00:11:31,732 --> 00:11:33,692

A SINGLE REFERENCE

211
00:11:33,692 --> 00:11:36,196

YOU TALKED ABOUT.

212

DANIELS: I DOUBT YOU WILL.

213
00:11:37,738 --> 00:11:40,283

WASN'T THERE?

214

DANIELS: BECAUSE
YOU WEREN'T THERE.

215
00:11:42,619 --> 00:11:46,206
ARCHER: SO I DISAPPEAR ONE DAY
AND ALL HISTORY CHANGES?

216
00:11:46,206 --> 00:11:49,584
DANIELS: I'VE LOOKED THROUGH
THE 21st AND 22nd CENTURIES.

217
00:11:49,584 --> 00:11:53,838
EVERYTHING LOOKS RIGHT,
UP UNTIL THE WARP 5 PROGRAM.

218
00:11:53,838 --> 00:11:56,383
AFTER THAT, NOTHING LOOKS RIGHT.

219
00:11:56,383 --> 00:11:57,967
ARCHER: THERE WERE
A LOT OF PEOPLE INVOLVED

220
00:11:57,967 --> 00:11:59,844
IN THE WARP 5 PROGRAM.

221
00:11:59,844 --> 00:12:01,638
DANIELS: WE DIDN'T BRING A LOT
OF PEOPLE HERE THIS MORNING.

222
00:12:01,638 --> 00:12:03,306
WE JUST BROUGHT YOU.

223
00:12:10,397 --> 00:12:13,983
ARCHER: THE ROMULAN STAR EMPIRE.
WHAT'S THAT?

224
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:16,110

BE READING THAT.

225
00:12:19,239 --> 00:12:21,115

226
00:12:21,115 --> 00:12:22,783
WHAT COULD I HAVE DONE

227
00:12:22,783 --> 00:12:24,369
THAT COULD HAVE BEEN
SO IMPORTANT?

228
00:12:24,369 --> 00:12:26,079

HELPED SET IN MOTION.

THE ONE YOU SAY
NO LONGER EXISTS--

232
00:12:34,629 --> 00:12:36,297
WHAT CAN YOU TELL ME
ABOUT IT

233
00:12:36,297 --> 00:12:38,341
IF MY MISSION HAD CONTINUED?

234
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:41,553
DANIELS: IT WOULD HAVE
LED TO OTHERS.

235
00:12:43,346 --> 00:12:45,014
ARCHER: AND?

236
00:12:48,101 --> 00:12:50,270
OK.

237
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:52,063
WHAT ABOUT
THIS FEDERATION?

238
00:12:52,063 --> 00:12:54,857
WAS EARTH PART OF IT?
WAS I PART OF IT?

239
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:59,529
DANIELS: SILIK WANTED YOU,
NOT THE DATA DISKS.

240
00:12:59,529 --> 00:13:01,656
THE PEOPLE HE ANSWERED TO
WERE MORE INTERESTED

241
00:13:01,656 --> 00:13:04,867
IN CAPTURING JONATHAN ARCHER
THAN IN BLAMING "ENTERPRISE"

242
00:13:04,867 --> 00:13:07,454
FOR THE DESTRUCTION
OF THE COLONY.

243
00:13:07,454 --> 00:13:10,290

WHAT ROLE YOU WERE GOING TO PLAY

OR YEARS TO COME.

FROM THE 22nd CENTURY,

I CAUSED EXACTLY
WHAT I WAS TRYING TO PREVENT.

247

ARCHER: YOU'VE LOST ME.

248
00:13:21,593 --> 00:13:24,554
DANIELS: THE ONLY CHANCE I HAVE
OF RESTORING MY CENTURY

249
00:13:24,554 --> 00:13:26,973
IS BY GETTING YOU
BACK TO YOURS.

250

A CHICKEN OR THE EGG PROBLEM.

ELECTRICITY HERE.

YOU GONNA FIND A BICYCLE,
TURN IT INTO A TIME MACHINE?

A TIME MACHINE.

257

WERE WORKING FOR

00:14:06,554 --> 00:14:09,182

WITH THOSE.

MORE COMPLICATED BUT NOT MUCH.

TRY TO STOP YOU?

IT SEEMS THAT STARFLEET

571
00:36:35,234 --> 00:36:38,822
ARE EAGER TO DISCUSS
THE FUTURE OF OUR MISSION.

BETWEEN MY PEOPLE
AND THE ANDORIANS,

583
00:37:06,975 --> 00:37:08,894
WHICH INCLUDED THE DESTRUCTION

584
00:37:08,894 --> 00:37:11,855

SACRED MONASTERIES.

REGARDLESS OF THE EVIDENCE

590
00:37:27,913 --> 00:37:29,998
I PLAN TO ADVISE
THE VULCAN HIGH COMMAND

591
00:37:29,998 --> 00:37:34,002
NOT TO CHANGE ITS RECOMMENDATION
TO STARFLEET.

592
00:37:34,002 --> 00:37:37,547

593
00:37:37,547 --> 00:37:39,591
TUCKER: YOU GUYS HAVE
WANTED TO SCRUB THIS MISSION

594
00:37:39,591 --> 00:37:41,259
FROM DAY ONE!

595
00:37:41,259 --> 00:37:44,387
WE PROVED TO YOU THAT WE DIDN'T
KILL THOSE 3,600 PEOPLE,

596
00:37:44,387 --> 00:37:46,139
BUT YOU DON'T WANT TO HEAR IT!

597
00:37:46,139 --> 00:37:47,432
YOU'RE PATHETIC!

598
00:37:47,432 --> 00:37:49,642

<i>THAT'S ENOUGH, COMMANDER.</i>

599
00:37:51,103 --> 00:37:53,396
FORREST: NO ONE'S
MORE PLEASED THAN I AM

600
00:37:53,396 --> 00:37:56,775
THAT "ENTERPRISE" WASN'T
RESPONSIBLE FOR THE TRAGEDY.

601
00:37:56,775 --> 00:38:00,946
BUT AMBASSADOR SOVAL'S
ARGUMENT MAY BE VALID.

602
00:38:00,946 --> 00:38:02,781
STARFLEET COMMAND HAS

603
00:38:02,781 --> 00:38:04,699
A DIFFICULT DECISION
TO MAKE HERE.

604
00:38:07,577 --> 00:38:11,330
WHEN I WAS IN MY EARLY 20s,
ON A TRIP TO EAST AFRICA,

605
00:38:11,330 --> 00:38:13,792
I SAW A GAZELLE GIVING BIRTH.

606
00:38:13,792 --> 00:38:15,710
IT WAS TRULY AMAZING.

607
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:17,921
WITHIN MINUTES, THE BABY
WAS STANDING UP--

608
00:38:17,921 --> 00:38:20,090
STANDING UP ON ITS OWN.

609
00:38:20,090 --> 00:38:22,259
A FEW MORE MINUTES,
AND IT WAS WALKING,

610
00:38:22,259 --> 00:38:23,676
AND BEFORE I KNEW IT,

611
00:38:23,676 --> 00:38:26,012
IT WAS RUNNING ALONGSIDE
ITS MOTHER,

612
00:38:26,012 --> 00:38:28,890
MOVING AWAY WITH THE HERD.

613
00:38:28,890 --> 00:38:31,601
HUMANS AREN'T LIKE THAT,
AMBASSADOR.

614
00:38:31,601 --> 00:38:34,562
WE MAY COME FROM THE SAME PLANET
AS THOSE GAZELLES,

615
00:38:34,562 --> 00:38:38,108
BUT WE'RE PRETTY MUCH
HELPLESS WHEN WE'RE BORN.

616
00:38:38,108 --> 00:38:41,778
IT TAKES US MONTHS
BEFORE WE'RE ABLE TO CRAWL,

617
00:38:41,778 --> 00:38:44,614
ALMOST A FULL YEAR
BEFORE WE CAN WALK.

618
00:38:44,614 --> 00:38:48,076
OUR DEEP-SPACE MISSION
ISN'T MUCH DIFFERENT.

619
00:38:48,076 --> 00:38:50,495
WE'RE GOING TO STUMBLE,
MAKE MISTAKES--

620
00:38:50,495 --> 00:38:54,916
I'M SURE MORE THAN A FEW
BEFORE WE FIND OUR FOOTING.

621
00:38:54,916 --> 00:38:59,504
BUT WE'RE GOING TO LEARN
FROM THOSE MISTAKES.

622
00:38:59,504 --> 00:39:01,422
THAT'S WHAT BEING HUMAN
IS ALL ABOUT.

623

HAVE LEARNED FROM THOSE EVENTS

THAT USING A SACRED SANCTUARY
TO SPY ON OTHERS

638
00:39:45,217 --> 00:39:48,636
