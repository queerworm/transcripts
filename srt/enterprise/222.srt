00:23:26,739 --> 00:23:28,241
VEYLO: NOT AT ALL.

510
00:23:28,282 --> 00:23:30,576
WE CHARGE OUR WEAPONS
THE SAME WAY.

511
00:23:32,286 --> 00:23:33,913
REED: MAYBE YOU'D LIKE TO SEE

512
00:23:33,954 --> 00:23:35,664
THE PHASE CANNON ASSEMBLY.

513
00:23:35,706 --> 00:23:37,499
VEYLO: PLEASE.

514
00:23:44,548 --> 00:23:46,550
REED: AFTER YOU.

515
00:23:52,098 --> 00:23:55,475
IT HAS
MULTIPHASIC EMITTERS...

516
00:23:55,517 --> 00:23:58,520
AND A MAXIMUM YIELD
OF 80 GIGAJOULES.

517
00:23:58,562 --> 00:23:59,897
VEYLO: IMPRESSIVE.

518
00:23:59,939 --> 00:24:01,565

IT'S SO CRAMPED IN HERE.

519
00:24:01,607 --> 00:24:03,276
VEYLO: DON'T BE.

520
00:24:03,317 --> 00:24:05,319
I WANTED TO GET A LITTLE
CLOSER TO YOU ALL DAY.

521
00:24:05,361 --> 00:24:06,987
REED: REALLY?

522
00:24:07,029 --> 00:24:09,782
VEYLO: I WAS HOPING TO SPEND
SOME INTIMATE TIME WITH YOU.

523
00:24:09,823 --> 00:24:12,534
MAYBE WE COULD
SLEEP TOGETHER TONIGHT.

524
00:24:12,576 --> 00:24:14,745
REED: OH!

525
00:24:14,787 --> 00:24:17,039
ON EARTH...

526
00:24:17,081 --> 00:24:20,960
IT'S CUSTOMARY TO ASK
A WOMAN TO DINNER FIRST

527
00:24:21,001 --> 00:24:23,670
BEFORE SPENDING
THE NIGHT WITH HER.

528
00:24:23,712 --> 00:24:25,631
VEYLO:
IT'S VERY DIFFERENT ON VISSIA.

529
00:24:25,672 --> 00:24:27,549
IT'S ONLY WHEN A WOMAN ENJOYS

530
00:24:27,591 --> 00:24:29,302
HER INTIMATE TIME WITH A MAN

531
00:24:29,343 --> 00:24:32,012
THAT SHE'LL JOIN HIM FOR DINNER.

532
00:24:32,054 --> 00:24:33,931
COGENITOR: "THE DIDIRON MOUNTAIN
RANGE RUNS THROUGH

533
00:24:33,973 --> 00:24:36,183
THE UPPER PLAINS
OF THE GREAT CONTINENT."

534
00:24:36,225 --> 00:24:37,393
TUCKER: AMAZING.

535
00:24:37,435 --> 00:24:38,894
COGENITOR: THE TEXT DESCRIBES

536
00:24:38,936 --> 00:24:40,229
FAR MORE IMPRESSIVE PEAKS.

537
00:24:40,271 --> 00:24:41,772
TUCKER: I DON'T MEAN
THE MOUNTAINS.

538
00:24:41,814 --> 00:24:43,732
I MEAN YOUR READING.

539
00:24:43,774 --> 00:24:45,985
COGENITOR: "THE FAUNA AND FLORA
VARY GREATLY

540
00:24:46,026 --> 00:24:48,486

OF THE CENTRAL PLATEAU."

541
00:24:48,528 --> 00:24:50,072
TUCKER: LOOK HOW
MUCH YOU'VE ACCOMPLISHED

542
00:24:50,114 --> 00:24:51,907
IN A SINGLE DAY.

543
00:24:51,949 --> 00:24:53,742
AND READING'S JUST
THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG.

544
00:24:53,784 --> 00:24:55,577
YOU COULD STUDY
ALL SORTS OF THINGS.

545
00:24:55,619 --> 00:24:57,955
HISTORY, SCIENCE.

546
00:24:57,997 --> 00:24:59,915
ENGINEERING'S NOT BAD.

547
00:24:59,957 --> 00:25:02,335
YOU DON'T HAVE TO SIT
IN THIS ROOM ALL DAY.

548
00:25:02,376 --> 00:25:04,586
COGENITOR: THEY WOULD NEVER
LET ME LEARN THOSE THINGS.

549
00:25:04,628 --> 00:25:06,922
TUCKER: THEN YOU'VE GOT
TO CONVINCE THEM.

550
00:25:06,964 --> 00:25:10,009
IT'S NOT JUST LEARNING.
IT'S--IT'S EXPERIENCING THINGS.

551
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:12,552
MUSIC, SWIMMING IN THE OCEAN.

552
00:25:12,594 --> 00:25:14,596
YOU DO HAVE OCEANS
ON YOUR PLANET?

553
00:25:14,638 --> 00:25:16,432
COGENITOR: YES.

554
00:25:16,474 --> 00:25:18,142
TUCKER: AND HOW ABOUT
THOSE DIDIRON MOUNTAINS?

555
00:25:18,184 --> 00:25:19,768
READING ABOUT THEM IS ONE THING.

556
00:25:19,810 --> 00:25:21,770
CLIMBING THEM IS ANOTHER.

557
00:25:21,812 --> 00:25:23,605
COGENITOR:
I'D LIKE TO CLIMB A MOUNTAIN.

558
00:25:23,647 --> 00:25:25,732
TUCKER: THERE YOU GO. THAT--

559
00:25:25,774 --> 00:25:28,027
THAT'S THE RIGHT ATTITUDE.

560
00:25:29,862 --> 00:25:31,697
YOU KEEP AT IT.

561
00:25:31,738 --> 00:25:33,032
I'VE GOT TO GET BACK.

562
00:25:33,073 --> 00:25:35,533
THEY THINK I'M AT
THE ASTROMETRICS LAB.

563
00:25:35,575 --> 00:25:37,495
BUT I'LL SEE YOU
AS SOON AS I CAN.

564
00:25:42,082 --> 00:25:43,625
COGENITOR: TRIP?

565
00:25:43,667 --> 00:25:45,543
TUCKER: YEAH?

566
00:25:45,585 --> 00:25:48,464
COGENITOR: I'D LIKE MY NAME
TO BE TRIP, JUST LIKE YOURS.

567
00:25:50,216 --> 00:25:52,343
TUCKER:
ACTUALLY, MY NAME IS CHARLES.

568
00:25:52,385 --> 00:25:56,347
COGENITOR: THEN I WOULD LIKE
MY NAME TO BE CHARLES.

569
00:25:56,389 --> 00:25:58,932
TUCKER: I'M FLATTERED.

570
00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:12,196
DRENNIK:
THERE'S A FLARE FORMING AHEAD.

571
00:26:12,238 --> 00:26:13,739
ARCHER: I DON'T SEE IT.

572
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:14,948
DRENNIK: YOU WILL.

573
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:17,284
TURN THE AXIS
40 DEGREES TO PORT.

574
00:26:17,326 --> 00:26:19,745
I THINK WE CAN BANK AROUND IT.

575
00:26:26,668 --> 00:26:28,170
ARCHER: IT'S TOO BIG.

576
00:26:28,212 --> 00:26:30,339
DRENNIK: TAKE US UP.
TRY TO GET OVER IT.

577
00:26:35,219 --> 00:26:36,887
ARCHER:
WE'RE NOT GONNA MAKE IT.

578
00:26:36,929 --> 00:26:38,638
DRENNIK: INCREASE SPEED.

579
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:40,974
ARCHER: IT WON'T BE ENOUGH.

580
00:26:45,104 --> 00:26:46,604
DRENNIK: WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

581
00:26:46,646 --> 00:26:48,482
ARCHER:
IF YOU CAN'T GET OVER A WAVE,

582
00:26:48,524 --> 00:26:50,401
YOU GOT TO DIVE THROUGH IT.

583
00:27:02,996 --> 00:27:05,541
DRENNIK:
WHERE DID YOU LEARN TO DO THAT?

584
00:27:05,583 --> 00:27:09,378
ARCHER: NORTH SHORE OF OAHU.
BODY SURFING.

585
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:13,006
DRENNIK: I THINK IT'S TIME
YOU TOOK THE HELM BACK.

586
00:27:23,392 --> 00:27:25,311
CHARLES: WOULD YOU BE PUNISHED
IF THEY FIND OUT

587
00:27:25,352 --> 00:27:26,937
YOU'VE BROUGHT ME HERE?

588
00:27:26,979 --> 00:27:28,481
TUCKER: PUNISHED? NO.

589
00:27:28,522 --> 00:27:30,732
BUT THEY MIGHT GET
A LITTLE ANGRY.

590
00:27:30,774 --> 00:27:32,318
CHARLES: I WOULD BE PUNISHED.

591
00:27:32,359 --> 00:27:34,278
TUCKER:
MAYBE I SHOULD TAKE YOU BACK.

592
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:36,489
CHARLES:
NO, NO, I WANT TO SEE MORE.

593
00:27:36,530 --> 00:27:40,200
TUCKER: OK. WE'LL JUST HAVE
TO BE SURE NO ONE SPOTS US.

594
00:27:42,786 --> 00:27:45,205
THIS IS OUR TRANSPORTER.

595
00:27:48,167 --> 00:27:50,336
IT TURNS THINGS
INTO A MATTER STREAM

596
00:27:50,377 --> 00:27:52,171
THAT CAN BE SENT
JUST ABOUT ANYWHERE,

597
00:27:52,212 --> 00:27:54,340
WITHIN 2,000 KILOMETERS OR SO.

598
00:27:54,381 --> 00:27:56,925
THEN IT GETS REASSEMBLED.

599
00:27:56,967 --> 00:27:58,511
CHARLES:
COULD IT SEND A VISSIAN?

600
00:27:58,552 --> 00:28:00,095
TUCKER: I DON'T SEE WHY NOT.

601
00:28:00,137 --> 00:28:01,679
CHARLES: I'D LIKE TO TRY.

602
00:28:01,721 --> 00:28:03,681
TUCKER: I DON'T THINK THAT
WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA.

603
00:28:05,392 --> 00:28:07,019
CHARLES:
COULD I SEE WHERE YOU WORK?

604
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:09,271
TUCKER: SURE. FOLLOW ME.

605
00:28:18,905 --> 00:28:21,158
COAST IS CLEAR.

606
00:28:32,336 --> 00:28:34,380
THAT'S OUR MAIN ENGINE--

607
00:28:34,421 --> 00:28:36,923
FASTEST ONE IN STARFLEET.

608
00:28:36,965 --> 00:28:38,842
I'VE HAD IT UP TO WARP 5.1.

609
00:28:38,884 --> 00:28:40,553
CHARLES: I THINK MY SHIP
HAS SOMETHING LIKE THIS,

610
00:28:40,594 --> 00:28:42,221
BUT I'VE NEVER SEEN IT.

611
00:28:42,262 --> 00:28:44,348
TUCKER: HA HA!
YOUR SHIP HAS AN ENGINE

612
00:28:44,390 --> 00:28:47,059
THAT'S A LOT MORE SOPHISTICATED
THAN THIS ONE.

613
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:49,186
CHARLES: DO YOU LIVE HERE?

614
00:28:49,228 --> 00:28:52,481
TUCKER: UH, NO.
MY QUARTERS ARE ON "B" DECK.

615
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:59,321
HAVE YOU EVER SEEN A MOVIE?

616
00:28:59,363 --> 00:29:01,073
IT'S NOT EASY PICKING A MOVIE

617
00:29:01,114 --> 00:29:04,243
FOR SOMEBODY WHO'S
NEVER SEEN ONE BEFORE.

618
00:29:05,827 --> 00:29:08,830
WHAT WOULD YOU THINK
ABOUT A WESTERN?

619
00:29:08,872 --> 00:29:11,542
NO, NOT A WESTERN.

620
00:29:11,584 --> 00:29:14,336
I DON'T THINK A MUSICAL
WOULD BE RIGHT, EITHER.

621
00:29:16,422 --> 00:29:19,466
GOT IT.
"THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL."

622
00:29:19,508 --> 00:29:22,553
NOTHING LIKE A LITTLE
SCIENCE FICTION TO BREAK YOU IN.

623
00:29:22,595 --> 00:29:24,804
CHARLES:
IT'S A STORY ABOUT YOUR PLANET?

624
00:29:24,846 --> 00:29:26,640
TUCKER: YEAH, BUT IT'S FICTION.

625
00:29:26,682 --> 00:29:28,642
THE EARTH NEVER
REALLY STOOD STILL.

626
00:29:28,684 --> 00:29:30,352
SIT DOWN.

627
00:29:31,853 --> 00:29:34,147
YOU'RE GONNA LOVE THIS.

628
00:29:46,285 --> 00:29:48,078
CHARLES:
WHY WERE THE HUMANS SO AFRAID

629
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:49,829
OF KLAATU AND HIS ANDROID?

630
00:29:49,871 --> 00:29:51,498
TUCKER: WELL,
BEFORE WE MADE FIRST CONTACT

631
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:53,041
WITH THE VULCANS,

632
00:29:53,083 --> 00:29:54,668
THE PEOPLE OF EARTH
WERE PRETTY VIOLENT.

633
00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:56,253
THEY HAD A HARD TIME
TRUSTING THINGS

634
00:29:56,295 --> 00:29:57,796
THEY DIDN'T UNDERSTAND.

635
00:29:57,837 --> 00:30:00,507
THE CHARACTERS IN THE FILM
KNEW NOTHING ABOUT KLAATU--

636
00:30:00,549 --> 00:30:02,884
WHO HE WAS,
WHERE HE CAME FROM--

637
00:30:02,926 --> 00:30:05,596
SO THEY TRIED TO KILL HIM.

638
00:30:05,638 --> 00:30:07,931
CHARLES: I UNDERSTAND.

639
00:30:14,104 --> 00:30:15,648
DOES THIS MEAN I'VE WON?

640
00:30:18,858 --> 00:30:22,362
TUCKER: NO ONE'S BEATEN ME
AT THIS IN THE LAST 2 YEARS.

641
00:30:22,404 --> 00:30:24,490
CHARLES:
TELL ME ABOUT WESTERNS.

642
00:30:24,531 --> 00:30:27,367
MAYBE I COULD
WATCH A WESTERN NEXT.

643
00:30:27,409 --> 00:30:29,244
TUCKER: IT'S GETTING LATE.

644
00:30:29,286 --> 00:30:31,789
WE BETTER GET YOU BACK
BEFORE THEY REALIZE YOU'RE GONE.

645
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:35,917
T'POL: I HAVE BEEN TOLD
YOU'RE NO LONGER WELCOME

646
00:30:35,959 --> 00:30:37,628
ABOARD THE VISSIAN SHIP.

647
00:30:37,670 --> 00:30:39,296
WHY?

648
00:30:39,338 --> 00:30:40,839
TUCKER: I WASN'T EXACTLY
WHERE I WAS SUPPOSED TO BE.

649
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,508
T'POL: NO, YOU WEREN'T.

650
00:30:42,549 --> 00:30:44,677
YOU TOLD THEM YOU WERE GOING
TO THE ASTROMETRICS LAB.

651
00:30:44,718 --> 00:30:47,387
THEY TRIED TO CONTACT YOU,
BUT YOU WEREN'T THERE.

652
00:30:47,429 --> 00:30:49,682
THEN THEY TRIED THEIR MESS HALL.
YOU WEREN'T THERE EITHER.

653
00:30:49,723 --> 00:30:51,141
TUCKER:
I WAS WITH THE COGENITOR.

654
00:30:51,183 --> 00:30:52,643
T'POL: WHERE?

655
00:30:52,685 --> 00:30:54,478
TUCKER:
AT FIRST IN HER QUARTERS.

656
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:56,855
ACTUALLY, THEY'RE
NOT HER QUARTERS.

657
00:30:56,896 --> 00:30:58,982
THEY BELONG TO
THE CHIEF ENGINEER AND HIS WIFE.

658
00:30:59,024 --> 00:31:00,651
SHE GETS A ROOM TO SLEEP IN,

659
00:31:00,693 --> 00:31:04,154
AND IF SHE'S REAL GOOD,
SHE CAN USE THEIR LIVING SPACE.

660
00:31:04,196 --> 00:31:05,989
T'POL: WHY WERE YOU THERE?

661
00:31:06,031 --> 00:31:08,033
TUCKER:
I'M TEACHING HER HOW TO READ.

662
00:31:08,074 --> 00:31:10,994
T'POL: HER EDUCATION
IS NOT YOUR CONCERN.

663
00:31:11,036 --> 00:31:12,830
TUCKER: WHAT EDUCATION?

664
00:31:12,871 --> 00:31:15,165
T'POL: WHERE ELSE DID YOU GO?

665
00:31:15,207 --> 00:31:16,834
TUCKER: I BROUGHT HER HERE,

666
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:20,379
GAVE HER A LITTLE TOUR,
SHOWED HER A MOVIE.

667
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:23,131
T'POL: IT APPEARS YOU'RE
DOING EVERYTHING YOU CAN

668
00:31:23,173 --> 00:31:25,091
TO UNDERMINE
THE CAPTAIN'S WISHES.

669
00:31:25,133 --> 00:31:27,260
TUCKER: ONE DAY.
THAT'S ALL IT TOOK HER.

670
00:31:27,302 --> 00:31:29,929
IN ONE DAY, SHE WAS READING
A GEOGRAPHY TEXT.

671
00:31:29,971 --> 00:31:34,059
T'POL: FIRST CONTACTS
ARE IMPORTANT TO THE CAPTAIN.

672
00:31:35,561 --> 00:31:39,648
YOU MAY VERY WELL HAVE
DAMAGED THIS ONE IRREPARABLY.

673
00:31:39,690 --> 00:31:42,901
TUCKER: YOU'RE NOT LISTENING
TO A WORD I'M SAYING.

00:31:58,041 --> 00:32:00,001
[CHARLES CLEARS THROAT]

675
00:32:00,043 --> 00:32:02,629
TUCKER: OH, I DIDN'T SEE YOU.

676
00:32:02,671 --> 00:32:04,172
HOW YOU DOING?

677
00:32:04,214 --> 00:32:05,549
YOU ALL RIGHT?
