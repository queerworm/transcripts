00:08:58,955 --> 00:09:02,959
I PREFER NOT TO INCONVENIENCE
ANYONE IF POSSIBLE.

171
00:09:03,001 --> 00:09:07,839
THAT PHILOSOPHY HAS SERVED ME
WELL IN THE DIPLOMATIC SERVICE.

172
00:09:07,881 --> 00:09:10,717
T'POL TELLS ME YOU NEGOTIATED
THE FIRST TERRITORIAL ACCORDS

173
00:09:10,758 --> 00:09:13,303
BETWEEN VULCAN AND ANDORIA.

174
00:09:13,345 --> 00:09:17,765
THE ANDORIANS REQUIRED
A SOMEWHAT FIRMER HAND

175
00:09:17,807 --> 00:09:20,143
AT THE NEGOTIATING TABLE.

176
00:09:20,185 --> 00:09:23,146
BUT I WAS YOUNGER THEN.

177
00:09:23,188 --> 00:09:26,358
THAT WAS BEFORE WE EVEN
MADE CONTACT WITH EARTH.

178
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,609
THAT WAS OVER 90 YEARS AGO.

179
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:30,445
HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN
A DIPLOMAT?

180
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:33,532
COMMANDER TUCKER.

181
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:35,534
I UNDERSTOOD THAT ON YOUR WORLD

182
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:39,413
IT IS CONSIDERED BAD MANNERS
TO ASK A LADY HER AGE.

183
00:09:39,454 --> 00:09:41,081
WELL, I-I WASN'T, UM...

184
00:09:41,122 --> 00:09:42,874
I, UH...

185
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:45,252
DIDN'T MEAN TO IMPLY
THAT YOU WERE...

186
00:09:45,293 --> 00:09:47,295
V'LAR: FORGIVE ME, COMMANDER.

187
00:09:47,337 --> 00:09:48,922
MY ATTEMPT AT HUMOR.

188
00:09:51,466 --> 00:09:55,887
V'LAR: SUFFICE IT TO SAY,
THAT WITH T'POL AND MYSELF HERE,

189
00:09:55,929 --> 00:09:57,264
YOU'RE ALMOST CERTAINLY DINING

190
00:09:57,305 --> 00:10:00,016
WITH THE TWO OLDEST PEOPLE
ON THIS SHIP.

191
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:07,732
I HOPE, AMBASSADOR,

192
00:10:07,774 --> 00:10:12,195
THAT YOU REGARD THE CHARGES
AGAINST YOU WITH LESS LEVITY.

193
00:10:12,237 --> 00:10:14,114
OF COURSE I DO.

194
00:10:14,155 --> 00:10:17,451
HOW DO YOU INTEND
TO DEFEND YOURSELF?

195
00:10:17,492 --> 00:10:19,202
THERE IS NO DEFENSE.

196
00:10:21,288 --> 00:10:22,956
ARE YOU SAYING YOU'RE GUILTY?

197
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:28,002
ARCHER: T'POL.
V'LAR: IT'S ALL RIGHT, CAPTAIN.

198
00:10:28,044 --> 00:10:32,966
A PERSON IN MY POSITION CARRIES
THE TRUST OF ALL VULCANS.

199
00:10:33,007 --> 00:10:35,427
THE FACT THAT THE MAZARITES

200
00:10:35,469 --> 00:10:37,471
BELIEVE THAT TRUST
HAS BEEN COMPROMISED

201
00:10:37,512 --> 00:10:40,557
JUSTIFIES T'POL'S CONCERN.

202
00:10:47,147 --> 00:10:50,567
I'M AFRAID MY AGE
IS BETRAYING ME, CAPTAIN.

203
00:10:50,609 --> 00:10:53,861
WOULD YOU MIND IF I RETIRED?

204
00:10:53,903 --> 00:10:55,530
ARCHER: OF COURSE NOT.

205
00:11:07,334 --> 00:11:09,503
I'VE NEVER BEEN TO EARTH.

206
00:11:09,544 --> 00:11:15,425
BUT I FIND THE HUMANS I HAVE
ENCOUNTERED QUITE UNPREDICTABLE.

207
00:11:15,467 --> 00:11:19,262
I'D BE INTERESTED IN HEARING
ABOUT YOUR EXPERIENCES THERE.

208
00:11:19,304 --> 00:11:23,682
T'POL: ANOTHER TIME PERHAPS.
V'LAR: I UNDERSTAND.

209
00:11:23,724 --> 00:11:27,312
T'POL: THIS IS YOUR CABIN.
I'LL SAY GOOD NIGHT.

210
00:11:27,354 --> 00:11:29,063
V'LAR: T'POL.

211
00:11:34,068 --> 00:11:36,446
I SENSE YOUR ANGER.

212
00:11:36,488 --> 00:11:38,532
T'POL: YOU PRESUME
THAT MY TIME WITH HUMANS

213
00:11:38,573 --> 00:11:41,451
HAS LEFT ME SUSCEPTIBLE
TO THEIR EMOTIONS.

214
00:11:41,493 --> 00:11:44,745
V'LAR: THEY'RE OUR
EMOTIONS AS WELL.

215
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:47,290
WE SIMPLY HIDE THEM BETTER.

216
00:11:47,332 --> 00:11:49,000
T'POL: IF YOU'RE
SENSING ANYTHING FROM ME,

217
00:11:49,042 --> 00:11:50,669
IT ISN'T ANGER.

218
00:11:56,591 --> 00:11:58,092
V'LAR: NO.

219
00:12:00,637 --> 00:12:02,972
DISAPPOINTMENT.

220
00:12:04,474 --> 00:12:06,267
T'POL: GOOD NIGHT, AMBASSADOR.

221
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:16,903
ARCHER: T'POL.
T'POL: CAPTAIN.

222
00:12:16,944 --> 00:12:19,656
ARCHER: IS THERE A PROBLEM
I SHOULD BE AWARE OF?

223
00:12:19,698 --> 00:12:22,200
T'POL: I ASSUME YOU'RE TALKING
ABOUT AMBASSADOR V'LAR.

224
00:12:22,242 --> 00:12:24,869
ARCHER: YOU WERE A BIT
ABRUPT WITH HER.

225
00:12:24,911 --> 00:12:29,123
T'POL: IF YOU BELIEVE I WAS
RUDE, I'LL CONVEY MY APOLOGIES.

226
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:31,626
ARCHER: I DON'T PRETEND
TO UNDERSTAND VULCANS.

227
00:12:31,668 --> 00:12:33,545
I NEVER HAVE.

228
00:12:33,587 --> 00:12:35,630
BUT I WOULDN'T BE A VERY GOOD
CAPTAIN IF I DIDN'T KNOW

229
00:12:35,672 --> 00:12:39,426
WHEN SOMETHING WAS BOTHERING
MY SCIENCE OFFICER.

230
00:12:39,467 --> 00:12:43,179
T'POL: IT'S UNCOMMON FOR
A VULCAN TO COMMIT A CRIME.

231
00:12:43,221 --> 00:12:45,682
ARCHER: UNCOMMON,
BUT NOT UNHEARD OF.

232
00:12:45,724 --> 00:12:49,436
T'POL: UNHEARD OF FOR A PERSON
IN AMBASSADOR V'LAR'S POSITION.

233
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:54,608
ARCHER: WE DON'T
KNOW WHAT SHE'S DONE.

234
00:12:54,649 --> 00:12:56,484
T'POL: IT DOESN'T MATTER.

235
00:12:56,526 --> 00:12:58,570
IF SHE WERE INNOCENT,

236
00:12:58,612 --> 00:13:01,989
SHE WOULD HAVE INSISTED
ON STAYING TO DEFEND HERSELF.

237
00:13:02,031 --> 00:13:03,491
ARCHER: YOU SEEM TO KNOW
A LOT ABOUT HER.

238
00:13:09,788 --> 00:13:11,666
T'POL: I'VE MET
THE AMBASSADOR BEFORE,

239
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:14,793
THOUGH SHE CLEARLY
DOESN'T RECALL.

240
00:13:14,835 --> 00:13:18,797
IT WAS MANY YEARS AGO ON VULCAN
DURING MY EARLY SCHOOLING.

241
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:21,760
SHE HAD JUST NEGOTIATED
THE TREATY OF KA'TANN

242
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:24,471
AND I TRAVELED
A GREAT DISTANCE TO SEE HER.

243
00:13:24,512 --> 00:13:25,846
ARCHER: WAS IT WORTH THE TRIP?

244
00:13:25,888 --> 00:13:27,932
T'POL: THE AMBASSADOR
INSPIRED ME

245
00:13:27,974 --> 00:13:30,935
TO CHOOSE A DIRECTION
IN MY OWN LIFE,

246
00:13:30,977 --> 00:13:33,647
A PATH THAT LED ME
TO THE SCIENCE COUNCIL

247
00:13:33,688 --> 00:13:35,356
AND EVENTUALLY HERE.

248
00:13:38,025 --> 00:13:41,904
ARCHER: I'VE HAD A FEW
HEROES IN MY LIFE.

249
00:13:41,946 --> 00:13:44,240
IT'S NEVER EASY
WHEN ONE OF THEM LETS YOU DOWN.

250
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:48,202
T'POL: VULCANS
DON'T HAVE HEROES.

251
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:50,997
ARCHER: NO.
I'M SURE THEY DON'T.

252
00:13:52,415 --> 00:13:53,916

00:13:59,046 --> 00:14:00,799

259
00:14:16,939 --> 00:14:18,149
WHAT CAN WE DO FOR YOU?

260
00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:20,485
<i>MY APOLOGIES, CAPTAIN.</i>

261
00:14:20,527 --> 00:14:23,904

00:14:30,077 --> 00:14:31,538

<i>THE MAGISTRATE FEELS THAT</i>

267
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:35,291

268
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:39,754
<i>SHE'S NEEDED</i>
<i>FOR ADDITIONAL QUESTIONING.</i>

269
00:14:39,796 --> 00:14:42,549
<i>WE DON'T WANT TO CAUSE YOU</i>

270
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:44,967

<i>WE CAN DOCK WITH YOU</i>

271
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:47,762

272
00:14:47,804 --> 00:14:52,726

273
00:14:52,767 --> 00:14:53,934

YOU DON'T THINK THEY'D TRUST ME

282
00:15:10,076 --> 00:15:12,161

ON MY OWN?

283

WE'VE TAKEN DAMAGE.

299
00:16:14,014 --> 00:16:16,309

WE CAN'T FIRE THEM AT WARP?

TO A VULCAN SHIP.

319
00:17:17,662 --> 00:17:19,622

SENT BY THE COUNCIL ON MAZAR.

WE'RE HERE AT THE REQUEST
OF THE VULCAN HIGH COMMAND.

326
00:17:42,812 --> 00:17:46,649
IT WOULD BE ILLOGICAL FOR YOU
TO WITHHOLD INFORMATION FROM US.

THERE ARE DIPLOMATIC MATTERS
AT STAKE HERE

HOW MUCH GREATER COULD IT GET?

A FEW MORE VOLLEYS
FROM THAT SHIP

333
00:17:58,452 --> 00:18:00,079

TRAVIS: WARP 4.9.

501
00:27:02,204 --> 00:27:04,540
THEY'RE HOLDING AT 4.9, SIR.

502
00:27:04,582 --> 00:27:07,084
ARCHER: HOW FAR TO
THE RENDEZVOUS POINT?

503
00:27:07,126 --> 00:27:09,836
TRAVIS: AT THIS SPEED,
A LITTLE OVER TWO HOURS.

504
00:27:09,878 --> 00:27:11,547
BUT I DON'T THINK WE CAN
HOLD IT THAT LONG.

505
00:27:13,757 --> 00:27:16,009
ARCHER: CAN WE GET A MESSAGE
THROUGH TO THE VULCANS?

506
00:27:16,051 --> 00:27:18,137
THE MAZARITES
ARE STILL JAMMING US.

507
00:27:18,178 --> 00:27:20,931
KEEP TRYING.

508
00:27:20,973 --> 00:27:23,683
THAT VULCAN SHIP
BETTER NOT BE LATE.

509
00:27:23,725 --> 00:27:25,144
V'LAR: CAPTAIN.

510
00:27:26,728 --> 00:27:28,564
WHAT'S OUR SITUATION?

511
00:27:32,650 --> 00:27:34,987
WE'RE BEING CHASED
BY 3 MAZARITE SHIPS.

512
00:27:36,489 --> 00:27:37,990
WILL WE REACH THE SH'RAAN

513
00:27:38,031 --> 00:27:39,408
BEFORE THEY CAN DO
ANY MORE DAMAGE?

514
00:27:43,496 --> 00:27:45,205
ARCHER: I'M NOT SURE.

515
00:27:50,752 --> 00:27:52,879
IN THAT CASE,
I NEED TO SPEAK WITH YOU.

516
00:28:00,971 --> 00:28:02,680
I HAVE TO CONSIDER
THE POSSIBILITY

517
00:28:02,722 --> 00:28:04,766
THAT THIS MISSION WILL FAIL.

518
00:28:04,808 --> 00:28:08,395
YOU STILL HAVEN'T TOLD ME
WHAT THIS MISSION IS.

519
00:28:08,437 --> 00:28:11,565
I'VE BEEN UNDER ORDERS TO TELL
YOU ONLY WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW.

520
00:28:11,607 --> 00:28:14,318
BUT THAT WASN'T THE ONLY REASON
I KEPT THINGS FROM YOU.

521
00:28:15,819 --> 00:28:18,572
I DIDN'T TRUST YOU.

522
00:28:18,614 --> 00:28:23,577
AS YOUR MR. TUCKER POINTED OUT,
I HAVE BEEN AROUND A LONG TIME.

523
00:28:23,619 --> 00:28:27,747
I REMEMBER WHEN NEWS OF YOUR
PEOPLE FIRST REACHED VULCAN.

524
00:28:27,789 --> 00:28:31,418
I WAS FASCINATED BY HUMANITY

525
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:33,546
BUT WORRIED AS WELL.

526
00:28:33,587 --> 00:28:35,047
ARCHER: YOU HADN'T EVEN MET US.

527
00:28:35,088 --> 00:28:38,551
V'LAR: YOU HAD JUST EMERGED
FROM A GLOBAL WAR.

528
00:28:38,592 --> 00:28:40,760
THE IDEA THAT YOU
DEEMED YOURSELVES READY

529
00:28:40,802 --> 00:28:44,598
TO JOIN THE INTERSTELLAR
COMMUNITY SEEMED...

530
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,475
PREMATURE.

531
00:28:46,517 --> 00:28:50,145
AND A CENTURY OF GOOD BEHAVIOR
HASN'T CHANGED YOUR MIND?

532
00:29:00,614 --> 00:29:04,284
THE MAZARITES PURSUING US
ARE CRIMINALS.

533
00:29:04,326 --> 00:29:06,119
THEY ARE
MEMBERS OF AN ORGANIZATION

534
00:29:06,161 --> 00:29:08,788
THAT'S INFILTRATED
ALL LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT,

535
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:11,875
MAKING THEMSELVES
WEALTHY AND POWERFUL

536
00:29:11,917 --> 00:29:14,753
AT THE EXPENSE
OF MANY INNOCENT VICTIMS.

537
00:29:17,464 --> 00:29:21,719
THEIR METHODS INCLUDE
ELIMINATING ANYONE

538
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,679
WHO STANDS IN THEIR WAY.

539
00:29:23,721 --> 00:29:25,847
ARCHER:
AND THAT WOULD INCLUDE YOU.

540
00:29:27,558 --> 00:29:30,185
MANY MAZARITES
WANT THEIR GOVERNMENT

541
00:29:30,227 --> 00:29:32,396
PURGED OF THIS CORRUPTION.

542
00:29:32,438 --> 00:29:34,189
THEY ASKED THE VULCAN CONSULATE

543
00:29:34,231 --> 00:29:37,109
TO HELP THEM EXPOSE
THESE CRIMINALS.

544
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:40,195
AND THAT JOB FELL TO YOU?

545
00:29:40,237 --> 00:29:43,657
I HAVE BEEN GATHERING EVIDENCE
AGAINST THEM.

546
00:29:43,699 --> 00:29:47,369
IN 3 MONTHS,
I WILL BE CALLED TO TESTIFY.

547
00:29:47,411 --> 00:29:51,790
IT WAS DECIDED THAT UNTIL THEN
I WOULD BE SAFER ON VULCAN.

548
00:29:51,831 --> 00:29:54,042
WHY COULDN'T YOU TELL US?

549
00:29:54,084 --> 00:29:57,713
THE INVESTIGATION WAS
CONSIDERED TOO SENSITIVE.

550
00:29:57,755 --> 00:30:00,882
AND THE STORY OF YOU
BEING RECALLED IN DISGRACE?

551
00:30:00,924 --> 00:30:06,513
IT WAS HOPED THAT
IF MY REPUTATION WERE SULLIED,

552
00:30:06,555 --> 00:30:09,224
THEY WOULD NOT CONSIDER ME
A CREDIBLE WITNESS

553
00:30:09,266 --> 00:30:11,851
AND THEY MIGHT NOT
COME AFTER ME.

554
00:30:11,893 --> 00:30:14,813
OBVIOUSLY, IT DIDN'T WORK.

555
00:30:14,854 --> 00:30:16,898
THE CORRUPTION RAN
DEEPER THAN I THOUGHT.

556
00:30:19,943 --> 00:30:21,236
I APPRECIATE...

557
00:30:23,196 --> 00:30:26,825
YOU TELLING ME THE TRUTH.

558
00:30:26,866 --> 00:30:30,954
I CAN NO LONGER PUT YOU AND
YOUR CREW IN DANGER, CAPTAIN.

559
00:30:30,996 --> 00:30:32,998
PLEASE DROP OUT OF WARP.

560
00:30:35,041 --> 00:30:37,127
I PLAN TO SURRENDER MYSELF
TO THEM.

561
00:30:41,923 --> 00:30:43,216
IT HASN'T GOTTEN TO THAT YET.

562
00:30:48,764 --> 00:30:50,683
V'LAR: IT'S THE MOST LOGICAL
COURSE OF ACTION.

T'POL: HOLDING AT WARP 4.9.

570
