00:18:05,001 --> 00:18:07,086
AS WELL AS WE CAN
IN THE PLANET'S ATMOSPHERE.

335
00:18:16,721 --> 00:18:18,305
SKALAAR:
THIS SHIP WASN'T DESIGNED

336
00:18:18,347 --> 00:18:20,058
FOR THESE MANEUVERS.

337
00:18:22,977 --> 00:18:24,604
WE'VE LOST THE AFT CANNONS.

338
00:18:24,645 --> 00:18:26,230
ARCHER:
WHAT ABOUT FORWARD CANNONS?

339
00:18:26,272 --> 00:18:28,066
SKALAAR: STILL ONLINE.

340
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:31,277
ARCHER: WHAT ARE THESE?

341
00:18:31,318 --> 00:18:33,153
SKALAAR: SUBSPACE BEACONS.

342
00:18:33,195 --> 00:18:35,489
THEY GENERATE
A FALSE WARP SIGNATURE.

343
00:18:35,531 --> 00:18:37,784
I USED ONE OF THEM
TO EVADE YOUR VESSEL.

344
00:18:37,825 --> 00:18:39,285
ARCHER: GET READY
TO LAUNCH THEM.

345
00:18:39,326 --> 00:18:40,828
SKALAAR: WHAT GOOD WILL THAT DO?

346
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:42,789
ARCHER: HE'S FLYING ON SENSORS
JUST LIKE WE ARE.

347
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:46,793
HE'LL ONLY HAVE A 1 IN 3 CHANCE
OF TARGETING US.

348
00:18:46,834 --> 00:18:48,002
SKALAAR: READY.

349
00:18:48,044 --> 00:18:50,088
ARCHER: NOW.

350
00:19:06,938 --> 00:19:09,231
WE KNOCKED OUT HIS ENGINE.

351
00:19:09,273 --> 00:19:11,191
HE'S MAKING
AN EMERGENCY LANDING.

352
00:19:11,233 --> 00:19:13,945
SKALAAR: DON'T CELEBRATE YET.
OUR REACTOR'S LEAKING.

353
00:19:13,987 --> 00:19:15,529
THE WARP DRIVE'S OFF-LINE.

354
00:19:15,571 --> 00:19:18,992
I'M NEVER GOING TO MAKE
THE RENDEZVOUS.

355
00:19:19,033 --> 00:19:20,785
ARCHER: ISN'T THAT A SHAME?

356
00:19:20,827 --> 00:19:23,537
SKALAAR: THE REACTOR
ALSO POWERS LIFE SUPPORT.

357
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:25,581
ARCHER:
THEN YOU'D BETTER GET TO WORK.

358
00:19:25,623 --> 00:19:29,209
SKALAAR: IT CAN ONLY BE
ACCESSED FROM THE OUTER HULL.

359
00:19:29,251 --> 00:19:30,753
ARCHER:
THEN WE SHOULD SET DOWN HERE.

360
00:19:30,795 --> 00:19:32,964
SKALAAR:
BUT KAGO'S ON THE SURFACE.

361
00:19:33,006 --> 00:19:35,716
ARCHER: WE'LL LAND
A THOUSAND KILOMETERS AWAY.

362
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:47,227
PHLOX: WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

363
00:19:47,269 --> 00:19:51,065
T'POL: YOU SAID WE'D NEED
ANOTHER TREATMENT.

364
00:19:51,107 --> 00:19:52,608
PHLOX: NOT FOR THREE HOURS.

365
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:54,527
T'POL: IS THERE ANY HARM
IN STARTING NOW?

366
00:19:54,568 --> 00:19:56,904
PHLOX: I CAN APPLY IT MYSELF.

367
00:19:56,946 --> 00:19:58,572
THANK YOU.

368
00:19:59,866 --> 00:20:01,742
PERHAPS YOU NEED
ANOTHER SEDATIVE.

369
00:20:01,784 --> 00:20:03,285
T'POL: REST IS NOT WHAT I NEED.

370
00:20:03,327 --> 00:20:04,954
PHLOX: SUB-COMMANDER,
THIS BEHAVIOR

371
00:20:04,996 --> 00:20:06,372
IS HARDLY APPROPRIATE.

372
00:20:06,413 --> 00:20:08,457
T'POL: MY NAME IS T'POL.

373
00:20:08,499 --> 00:20:10,043
YOU DON'T FIND ME ATTRACTIVE?

374
00:20:10,084 --> 00:20:12,920
PHLOX: OF COURSE I DO,
BUT THAT IS NOT THE ISSUE.

375
00:20:12,962 --> 00:20:16,298
T'POL: I'M FAMILIAR WITH
DENOBULAN SEXUALITY.

376
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:18,384
I KNOW THAT YOUR MARRIAGES
AREN'T EXCLUSIVE.

377
00:20:18,425 --> 00:20:20,553
PHLOX: YOU AND I ARE COLLEAGUES.

378
00:20:20,594 --> 00:20:22,221
IT'S AGAINST REGULATIONS.

379
00:20:22,262 --> 00:20:23,848
T'POL: STARFLEET REGULATIONS.

380
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:26,642
THERE'S NO REASON TO BE
RESTRAINED BY HUMAN MORALITY.

381
00:20:26,684 --> 00:20:29,687
PHLOX: IT'S OBVIOUS
YOU'RE NOT WELL. PLEASE.

382
00:20:32,023 --> 00:20:35,526
T'POL: YOU HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT YOU'RE DENYING YOURSELF.

383
00:20:35,568 --> 00:20:37,319
YOUR ENDORPHIN
AND HORMONAL LEVELS

384
00:20:37,361 --> 00:20:39,072
ARE DANGEROUSLY HIGH.

385
00:20:39,113 --> 00:20:41,115
T'POL: YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.
I'M NOT ILL.

386
00:20:41,157 --> 00:20:42,950
PHLOX: THESE ARE HARDLY
NORMAL READINGS.

387
00:20:42,992 --> 00:20:46,037
T'POL: THEY'RE NORMAL
FOR A VULCAN IN MY CONDITION.

388
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:48,039
PHLOX:
YOU KNOW WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?

389
00:20:50,083 --> 00:20:52,752
T'POL: IT'S NOT SOMETHING
WE DISCUSS WITH OTHERS.

390
00:20:54,962 --> 00:20:56,547
PHLOX: I BELIEVE IT'S TIME

391
00:20:56,589 --> 00:20:59,092
FOR YOU TO AMEND THAT POLICY.

392
00:20:59,133 --> 00:21:01,928
YOU HAVE MY ASSURANCE
IT WILL REMAIN BETWEEN US.

393
00:21:04,597 --> 00:21:06,807
T'POL: WE CALL IT THE PON FARR--

394
00:21:06,849 --> 00:21:09,018
THE CYCLE OF MATING.

395
00:21:10,603 --> 00:21:13,480
PHLOX: HAVE YOU GONE
THROUGH THIS BEFORE?

396
00:21:15,315 --> 00:21:16,859
T'POL: IT'S NOT TIME.

397
00:21:16,901 --> 00:21:18,569
PHLOX:
IT'S POSSIBLE THE INFECTION

398
00:21:18,611 --> 00:21:20,029
ACTED AS A CATALYST.

399
00:21:20,071 --> 00:21:22,364
T'POL:
WHAT CAUSED IT DOESN'T MATTER.

400
00:21:22,406 --> 00:21:24,867
IF I DON'T MATE WITH A MALE--
VULCAN OR OTHERWISE--

401
00:21:24,909 --> 00:21:26,869
I'LL DIE.

402
00:21:37,171 --> 00:21:41,508
ARCHER: THAT SHIP YOU MENTIONED,
THE "TEZRA"...

403
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:43,427
SOUNDS PRETTY IMPORTANT TO YOU.

404
00:21:43,469 --> 00:21:45,679
SKALAAR: MORE THAN YOU KNOW.

405
00:21:45,721 --> 00:21:48,390
IF KAGO COLLECTS THE REWARD,

406
00:21:48,432 --> 00:21:53,020
HE'LL PROBABLY WASTE IT
ON ORION SLAVE GIRLS.

407
00:21:53,062 --> 00:21:54,647
NOT ME.

408
00:21:54,688 --> 00:21:57,066
I'M GOING TO DO SOMETHING USEFUL
WITH IT.

409
00:21:57,108 --> 00:21:59,735
ARCHER: I DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHY YOU WANT A CARGO SHIP.

410
00:21:59,777 --> 00:22:02,321
DOESN'T SEEM PRACTICAL
IN YOUR LINE OF WORK.

411
00:22:02,362 --> 00:22:04,157
SKALAAR: YOU THINK
I'VE BEEN CHASING

412
00:22:04,198 --> 00:22:06,826
FUGITIVES MY ENTIRE LIFE?

413
00:22:06,867 --> 00:22:08,953
NO, ONCE I GET THE MONEY,

414
00:22:08,995 --> 00:22:12,581
I'LL HAVE ENOUGH TO PAY OFF
THE IMPOUND FEES.

415
00:22:12,623 --> 00:22:15,001
I'LL BE A FREIGHTER CAPTAIN
AGAIN.

416
00:22:15,042 --> 00:22:17,377
ARCHER:
MY HELMSMAN USED TO RUN FREIGHT.

417
00:22:17,419 --> 00:22:19,046
THE TWO OF YOU
WOULD PROBABLY HAVE

418
00:22:19,088 --> 00:22:20,756
A LOT TO TALK ABOUT.

419
00:22:20,798 --> 00:22:23,383
SKALAAR: NO, THE "TEZRA"
ISN'T LIKE ANY OTHER CARGO SHIP.

420
00:22:23,425 --> 00:22:28,181
SHE WAS THE FIRST OF HER CLASS,
THE FASTEST EVER BUILT.

421
00:22:28,222 --> 00:22:30,348
NOW, SHE COULD HAUL
A MILLION METRIC TONS

422
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:31,976
AT WARP 4.5.

423
00:22:32,018 --> 00:22:34,478
EVEN YOUR STARSHIP
ISN'T CAPABLE OF THAT.

424
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:36,856
I RETROFITTED
HER ENGINES MYSELF.

425
00:22:36,897 --> 00:22:40,276
ARCHER: YOU NEVER TOLD ME
WHY IT WAS IMPOUNDED.

426
00:22:40,318 --> 00:22:42,111
SKALAAR:
MY BROTHER AND I WERE HAULING

427
00:22:42,153 --> 00:22:44,155
A SHIPMENT OF FIRE SALT.

428
00:22:45,865 --> 00:22:48,784
I THOUGHT I COULD TRIM
2 OR 3 DAYS OFF OUR JOURNEY

429
00:22:48,826 --> 00:22:51,453
BY CUTTING ACROSS
THE MOST INSIGNIFICANT CORNER

430
00:22:51,495 --> 00:22:53,580
OF KLINGON SPACE.

431
00:22:53,622 --> 00:22:56,125
I LEARNED VERY QUICKLY
THERE'S NO SUCH THING

432
00:22:56,167 --> 00:22:59,212
AS AN INSIGNIFICANT CORNER
OF KLINGON SPACE.

433
00:22:59,253 --> 00:23:02,589
WE WERE LUCKY TO ESCAPE
WITH OUR LIVES,

434
00:23:02,631 --> 00:23:05,259
THOUGH WE DID PAY A PRICE.

435
00:23:05,301 --> 00:23:06,969
ARCHER: THEY TOOK YOUR SHIP.

436
00:23:07,011 --> 00:23:08,846
SKALAAR: AND ITS CARGO, TOO.

437
00:23:08,888 --> 00:23:11,140
MY BROTHER NEVER FORGAVE ME.

438
00:23:11,182 --> 00:23:12,599
I'VE BEEN TRYING TO FIND A WAY

439
00:23:12,641 --> 00:23:14,560
TO GET THE "TEZRA" BACK
EVER SINCE.

440
00:23:14,601 --> 00:23:16,520
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!

441
00:23:20,024 --> 00:23:22,860
ARCHER: DID YOU REALLY THINK
I WANTED THIS ENGINE FIXED?

442
00:23:22,902 --> 00:23:25,071
YOU'RE TAKING ME TO BE EXECUTED.

443
00:23:33,746 --> 00:23:37,791
SKALAAR: DON'T WORRY.
WE'LL MEET GOROTH ON TIME.

444
00:23:49,053 --> 00:23:51,055
PHLOX: FEELING ANY BETTER?

445
00:23:54,725 --> 00:23:57,561
T'POL: I'M HUNGRY.

446
00:23:57,603 --> 00:24:00,147
PHLOX: OUR MEALS
WILL BE HERE SOON.

447
00:24:00,189 --> 00:24:02,400
T'POL: I WASN'T REFERRING
TO FOOD.

448
00:24:03,901 --> 00:24:05,986
PHLOX:
I'M WORKING AS QUICKLY AS I CAN.

449
00:24:06,028 --> 00:24:09,447
THIS SERUM SHOULD HELP ALLEVIATE
MOST OF YOUR SYMPTOMS.

450
00:24:11,325 --> 00:24:14,287
T'POL:
THERE'S A FAR SIMPLER TREATMENT.

451
00:24:14,328 --> 00:24:15,955
PHLOX: I'D PREFER TO EXPLORE

452
00:24:15,996 --> 00:24:17,831
A MORE CONVENTIONAL APPROACH.

453
00:24:19,708 --> 00:24:22,544
T'POL: YOU HAVE THE CURE.

454
00:24:22,586 --> 00:24:24,964
IT'S UNETHICAL FOR YOU
TO WITHHOLD IT, DOCTOR.

455
00:24:25,005 --> 00:24:26,506
PHLOX: THIS MATING
CYCLE OF YOURS WAS

456
00:24:26,548 --> 00:24:28,175
ARTIFICIALLY INDUCED.

457
00:24:28,217 --> 00:24:30,344
WE CAN'T BE CERTAIN THAT A--

458
00:24:30,386 --> 00:24:31,887
PHYSICAL ENCOUNTER WOULD HELP.

459
00:24:31,929 --> 00:24:33,471
T'POL: I'M WILLING TO TRY.

460
00:24:33,513 --> 00:24:36,392
PHLOX: SUB-COMMANDER.

461
00:24:36,434 --> 00:24:39,061
T'POL: DON'T BE FRIGHTENED.
I WON'T HURT YOU.

462
00:24:39,103 --> 00:24:40,854
PHLOX: YOU'RE DISTURBING
MY SERUM!

463
00:24:40,896 --> 00:24:42,440
OBVIOUSLY YOU NEED
TO BE SEDATED AGAIN.

464
00:24:42,522 --> 00:24:44,442
T'POL: NO MORE HYPOSPRAYS!

465
00:24:44,482 --> 00:24:45,734
[BEEPS]

466
00:24:45,776 --> 00:24:48,528
PHLOX: ONE OF US
SHOULD PROBABLY ANSWER THAT.

467
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:51,657
I--IT COULD BE NEWS
ABOUT THE CAPTAIN.

468
00:24:51,698 --> 00:24:55,035
[BEEPS]

469
00:24:55,077 --> 00:24:56,912
THIS IS PHLOX.

470
00:24:56,954 --> 00:24:58,496
TUCKER: Anyone hungry in there?

471
00:24:58,538 --> 00:25:00,291
I brought you some supper.

472
00:25:02,376 --> 00:25:05,296
PHLOX: JUST IN THE NICK OF TIME,
COMMANDER.

473
00:25:08,382 --> 00:25:11,177
IT WOULD BE BEST
IF YOU REMAINED HERE.

474
00:25:17,683 --> 00:25:19,768
TUCKER: HOW ARE YOU
TWO HOLDING UP?

475
00:25:19,810 --> 00:25:22,188
PHLOX: WELL ENOUGH.

476
00:25:24,648 --> 00:25:26,859
HAVE YOU BEEN ABLE
TO LOCATE CAPTAIN ARCHER?

477
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:28,819
TUCKER: WE'RE TRACKING ANOTHER
WARP SIGNATURE.

478
00:25:28,861 --> 00:25:31,238
HOPEFULLY THIS ONE'S
THE REAL THING.

479
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:33,949
ARE THOSE THE ONES YOU WANTED?

480
00:25:33,991 --> 00:25:36,369
PHLOX: YES. THANK YOU.

481
00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:37,744
T'POL: IS THAT FOOD?

482
00:25:37,786 --> 00:25:40,414
TUCKER: YEAH.

483
00:25:40,456 --> 00:25:43,376
I HAD CHEF MAKE YOU SOME...

484
00:25:46,879 --> 00:25:48,630
IS SHE ALL RIGHT?

485
00:25:48,672 --> 00:25:51,050
PHLOX:
SHE'S DEVELOPED A SLIGHT FEVER.

486
00:25:51,091 --> 00:25:52,759
NOTHING TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT.

487
00:25:57,473 --> 00:25:58,598
[BEEPS]

488
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,267
REED:
Bridge to Commander Tucker.

489
00:26:00,309 --> 00:26:01,519
TUCKER: GO AHEAD.

490
00:26:01,559 --> 00:26:03,354
REED: We're approaching
the coordinates.

491
00:26:03,396 --> 00:26:04,730
TUCKER: ON MY WAY.

492
00:26:06,065 --> 00:26:08,442
CALL IF YOU NEED ANYTHING.

493
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:22,498
WHAT HAVE YOU GOT?

494
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:24,041
REED: TWO MATCHING
WARP SIGNATURES,

495
00:26:24,083 --> 00:26:25,459
BOTH IN THE UPPER ATMOSPHERE.

496
00:26:25,501 --> 00:26:27,127
MORE SUBSPACE BEACONS.

497
00:26:27,169 --> 00:26:28,628
THERE IS A SHIP ON THE SURFACE.

498
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:30,381
IT SEEMS TO HAVE SUFFERED
ENGINE DAMAGE.

499
00:26:30,423 --> 00:26:32,258
BUT IT'S NOT TELLARITE.

500
00:26:32,299 --> 00:26:34,176
TUCKER: BIO-SIGNS?
REED: ONE.

501
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:38,013
