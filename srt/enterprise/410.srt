693
00:39:20,525 --> 00:39:22,152
SURE.

694
00:39:26,531 --> 00:39:29,534
SOMETHING TELLS ME YOU'RE NOT
HERE TO TALK ABOUT MOVIE NIGHT.

695
00:39:31,410 --> 00:39:36,708
I'M GOING THROUGH SOMETHING
THAT'S VERY COMPLICATED.

696
00:39:36,708 --> 00:39:38,710
I KNOW.

697
00:39:40,879 --> 00:39:43,673
I'M LEARNING,
IT SEEMS FOR THE FIRST TIME

698
00:39:43,673 --> 00:39:46,718
WHAT IT TRULY
MEANS TO BE VULCAN.

699
00:39:47,802 --> 00:39:49,637
WELL, MAYBE YOU CAN FILL ME IN.

700
00:39:49,637 --> 00:39:52,349
NOT UNTIL I UNDERSTAND IT
MYSELF.

701
00:39:56,602 --> 00:39:59,564
I DON'T THINK
THERE'LL BE TIME FOR...

702
00:40:01,566 --> 00:40:03,860
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO SAY?

703
00:40:03,860 --> 00:40:06,696
THAT YOU UNDERSTAND.

704
00:40:06,696 --> 00:40:09,074
I DO.

705
00:40:10,658 --> 00:40:13,161
IT'S NOT LIKE I DIDN'T
KNOW THIS WAS COMING.

706
00:40:22,212 --> 00:40:24,630
AT LEAST MY WARP ENGINES
STILL NEED ME.

707
00:40:32,138 --> 00:40:33,765
CAPTAIN'S STARLOG,
SUPPLEMENTAL.

708
00:40:33,765 --> 00:40:35,934
WE'VE RENDEZVOUSED
WITH THE<i> SARAJEVO,</i>

709
00:40:35,934 --> 00:40:39,854
WHICH WILL BE RETURNING
EMORY AND DANICA TO EARTH.

710
00:40:39,854 --> 00:40:41,689
SAFE JOURNEY.

711
00:40:41,689 --> 00:40:44,859
AND YOU, JONATHAN.

712
00:40:47,528 --> 00:40:49,114
COMMANDER.

713
00:40:53,701 --> 00:40:56,704
AN HONOR WORKING WITH YOU.

714
00:40:56,704 --> 00:40:59,332
SOME SUGGESTIONS.

715
00:40:59,332 --> 00:41:02,043
MIGHT BOOST
YOUR TRANSPORTER RANGE

716
00:41:02,043 --> 00:41:04,796
A FEW HUNDRED KILOMETERS.

717
00:41:04,796 --> 00:41:07,382
COULDN'T RESIST.

718
00:41:09,467 --> 00:41:11,428
I'LL CHECK IT OUT.

719
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,680
SAY GOODBYE TO PORTHOS.

720
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:17,683
GOOD LUCK.

721
00:41:17,683 --> 00:41:19,352
MAYBE I'LL SEE YOU AROUND.
