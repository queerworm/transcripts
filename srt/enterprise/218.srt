YOU HEARD HIM.

345
00:21:12,021 --> 00:21:13,647
LET'S TRY TO PRIME
THE DEUTERIUM PUMPS

346
00:21:13,689 --> 00:21:15,024
AND FIRE UP THE INJECTORS.

347
00:21:15,066 --> 00:21:17,068
TUCKER: TUCKER TO ENSIGN COOK.
COOK: Yes, sir.

348
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:19,319
TUCKER: I NEED YOU AND TWO OTHER
ENGINEERS DOWN HERE RIGHT AWAY.

349
00:21:19,361 --> 00:21:20,905
COOK: I'll see who I can find.

350
00:21:20,947 --> 00:21:22,489
ROSTOV: COMMANDER!

351
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:24,575
TUCKER:
QUICKLY, PLEASE. TUCKER OUT.

352
00:21:24,617 --> 00:21:26,953
SOMETHING WRONG?

353
00:21:34,127 --> 00:21:36,129
RUN INTO A PROBLEM?

354
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:38,547
ROSTOV: PROBLEM?

355
00:21:38,589 --> 00:21:41,842
NO, EVERYTHING'S FINE.

356
00:21:41,884 --> 00:21:45,763
TUCKER: DID YOU HAVE ANY LUCK
PRIMING THE PUMPS?

357
00:21:45,805 --> 00:21:48,682
ROSTOV:
I HAVE NO IDEA HOW TO DO THAT.

358
00:21:48,724 --> 00:21:50,810
THIS ENGINE IS VERY COMPLEX.

359
00:21:52,895 --> 00:21:55,689
TUCKER:
STAY HERE. I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

360
00:21:57,441 --> 00:21:59,110
TUCKER TO THE CAPTAIN.

361
00:21:59,152 --> 00:22:02,613
ARCHER: GO AHEAD, TRIP.
TUCKER: It's Rostov, sir.

362
00:22:02,655 --> 00:22:04,240
I think you need
to get Malcolm--

363
00:22:04,282 --> 00:22:06,117
I MEAN WHOEVER'S
RUNNING SECURITY

364
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:07,868
DOWN HERE RIGHT AWAY.

365
00:22:10,412 --> 00:22:13,791
ARCHER: HOSHI, GET A SECURITY
TEAM TO ENGINEERING.

366
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:15,626
HAVE THEM PUT CREWMAN ROSTOV
IN HIS QUARTERS.

367
00:22:15,668 --> 00:22:17,170
HOSHI: AYE, SIR.

368
00:22:17,211 --> 00:22:18,921
CAPTAIN, WE'VE BEEN
GETTING REPORTS

369
00:22:18,963 --> 00:22:20,589
FROM ALL OVER THE SHIP.

370
00:22:20,631 --> 00:22:22,800
SOME OF THE CREW
ARE ACTING VERY STRANGE.

371
00:22:22,842 --> 00:22:24,635
ARCHER: THEN WE'RE GOING TO NEED

372
00:22:24,677 --> 00:22:26,553
MORE THAN ONE SECURITY TEAM.

373
00:22:26,595 --> 00:22:28,388
FIND OUT WHO'S ACTING STRANGE

374
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:30,516
AND HAVE THEM CONFINED
TO THEIR QUARTERS.

375
00:22:30,557 --> 00:22:33,936
TRAVIS: HOW DO WE KNOW
THE SECURITY OFFICERS ARE OK?

376
00:22:33,978 --> 00:22:37,231
ARCHER: FOR THE MOMENT, WE'RE
GOING TO HAVE TO HOPE THEY ARE.

377
00:22:37,273 --> 00:22:39,650
START WORKING ON A WAY
TO FIGURE OUT

378
00:22:39,692 --> 00:22:42,236
WHO'S THEMSELVES AND WHO'S NOT.

379
00:22:42,278 --> 00:22:44,947
MAYBE PHLOX CAN HELP YOU.

380
00:22:50,786 --> 00:22:52,997
COOK: COMMANDER.

381
00:22:57,751 --> 00:22:59,212
TUCKER: RUN INTO A PROBLEM?

382
00:22:59,253 --> 00:23:01,130
COOK: NO, SIR.

383
00:23:01,172 --> 00:23:02,715
JUST READY TO CALIBRATE
THE DILITHIUM MATRIX.

384
00:23:02,756 --> 00:23:05,968
TUCKER: GREAT. WAIT
TILL I GIVE YOU THE SIGNAL.

385
00:23:10,639 --> 00:23:12,641
HOSHI:
WE POLARIZED THE HULL PLATING

386
00:23:12,683 --> 00:23:14,727
AS SOON AS WE DETECTED
THAT SHIP.

387
00:23:14,768 --> 00:23:16,979
OBVIOUSLY IT DIDN'T DO ANY GOOD.

388
00:23:17,021 --> 00:23:19,106
WHAT'S KEEPING THEM
FROM TAKING ALL OF US?

389
00:23:19,148 --> 00:23:20,649
[COMPUTER BEEPS]

390
00:23:20,691 --> 00:23:22,735
ARCHER: ARCHER.

391
00:23:22,776 --> 00:23:24,362
TUCKER: YOU'VE GOT
IMPULSE ENGINES BACK, CAPTAIN.

392
00:23:24,402 --> 00:23:25,988
ARCHER: Thanks, Trip.

393
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:27,990
HOLD OUR POSITION.

394
00:23:28,032 --> 00:23:30,159
HOSHI: I THOUGHT YOU SAID
WE NEEDED TO GET OUT OF HERE.

395
00:23:30,201 --> 00:23:32,661
ARCHER: THEY'VE GOT MALCOLM
AND GOD KNOWS HOW MANY OTHERS.

396
00:23:32,703 --> 00:23:34,663
UNTIL WE FIND A WAY
TO GET THEM BACK,

397
00:23:34,705 --> 00:23:36,582
WE'RE NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

398
00:23:42,713 --> 00:23:44,673
ARCHER: WHAT'S THE BIG SECRET?

399
00:23:44,715 --> 00:23:46,842
T'POL: WE THOUGHT IT BEST NOT
TO DISCUSS THIS OVER THE COMM.

400
00:23:46,884 --> 00:23:48,719
WE DON'T KNOW WHO'S BEEN TAKEN.

401
00:23:48,761 --> 00:23:50,179
ARCHER: WHAT HAVE YOU GOT?

402
00:23:50,221 --> 00:23:52,098
PHLOX: IT WAS SIMPLER
THAN I THOUGHT.

403
00:23:52,139 --> 00:23:54,225
ELEVATED ACETYLCHOLINE LEVELS
IN THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS--

404
00:23:54,267 --> 00:23:58,104
ARCHER: DOCTOR, WHATEVER YOU'VE
GOT, WE NEED TO PUT IT TO WORK.

405
00:23:58,145 --> 00:24:00,898
PHLOX: THE SUB-COMMANDER
PROGRAMMED THE MEDICAL COMPUTER.

406
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:03,609
IT'S MODIFYING
THIS HAND-SCANNER AS WE SPEAK.

407
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:05,819
ARCHER: GET TO WORK
AS SOON AS YOU'RE READY.

408
00:24:09,907 --> 00:24:11,575
TUCKER:
Tucker to Ensign Mayweather.

409
00:24:11,617 --> 00:24:12,868
TRAVIS: GO AHEAD, SIR.

410
00:24:12,910 --> 00:24:14,787
TUCKER: I'm a little
short-handed, Travis.

411
00:24:14,828 --> 00:24:16,622
THINK I COULD GET YOU TO GO BACK
TO THE STARBOARD NACELLE

412
00:24:16,663 --> 00:24:18,165
AND REPOLARIZE THE WARP COILS?

413
00:24:18,207 --> 00:24:19,666
TRAVIS: NO PROBLEM, SIR.

414
00:24:19,708 --> 00:24:21,210
TUCKER: Call me when you get
to the catwalk.

415
00:24:21,252 --> 00:24:23,129
TRAVIS: I'M ON MY WAY.

416
00:24:31,137 --> 00:24:33,055
T'POL: THERE ARE TWO HERE.

417
00:24:36,516 --> 00:24:40,271
PHLOX:
ENSIGN COLE AND CREWMAN ROSSI.

418
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:19,185
TRAVIS: MAYWEATHER
TO THE BRIDGE.

419
00:25:19,226 --> 00:25:20,727
ARCHER: Go ahead.

420
00:25:20,769 --> 00:25:22,313
TRAVIS: ONE OF THOSE THINGS
JUST FOLLOWED ME

421
00:25:22,355 --> 00:25:24,148
UP THE STARBOARD STRUT,

422
00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:25,941
BUT WHEN I GOT INTO THE CATWALK,
IT DIDN'T COME THROUGH.

423
00:25:25,983 --> 00:25:27,734
THERE MUST BE SOMETHING KEEPING
IT FROM GETTING IN HERE.

424
00:25:27,776 --> 00:25:29,445
ARCHER: THEN YOU BETTER STAY
WHERE YOU ARE.

425
00:25:29,487 --> 00:25:30,988
TRAVIS: Aye, sir.

426
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:33,073
ARCHER:
ARCHER TO COMMANDER TUCKER.

427
00:25:33,115 --> 00:25:34,867
TUCKER: YES, CAPTAIN?

428
00:25:34,908 --> 00:25:36,869
ARCHER:
Is there some kind of shielding

429
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:39,955
IN THE NACELLES THAT MIGHT KEEP
THESE ALIENS FROM GETTING IN?

430
00:25:39,997 --> 00:25:42,333
TUCKER: THE CATWALK'S
REINFORCED WITH OSMIUM ALLOY,

431
00:25:42,375 --> 00:25:44,043
BUT IT'S HARD TO SAY
IF THAT WOULD DO IT.

432
00:25:44,084 --> 00:25:45,752
ARCHER: Travis thinks it will.

433
00:25:45,794 --> 00:25:47,338
I NEED YOU TO STOP
WHATEVER YOU'RE DOING

434
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:49,131
AND TRANSFER
ALL COMMAND FUNCTIONS

435
00:25:49,173 --> 00:25:50,841
to the starboard catwalk.

436
00:25:50,883 --> 00:25:52,592
We're going to have to get
everybody in there.

437
00:25:52,634 --> 00:25:54,428
TUCKER: I'M ON IT.

438
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:56,554
ARCHER: I WANT YOU AND T'POL
TO GET THE CREW UP THERE

439
00:25:56,596 --> 00:25:59,141
AS QUICKLY AS YOU CAN.

440
00:25:59,183 --> 00:26:01,894
HOSHI.

441
00:26:01,935 --> 00:26:04,980
HOSHI: IT WOULD BE BEST
IF THEY STAYED WHERE THEY WERE.

442
00:26:05,022 --> 00:26:07,066
ARCHER: WHAT?

443
00:26:07,107 --> 00:26:09,193
HOSHI: WE'RE OFFERING THEM
A GREAT OPPORTUNITY.

444
00:26:09,235 --> 00:26:11,404
THEY MAY NEVER
GET ANOTHER CHANCE

445
00:26:11,445 --> 00:26:14,698
TO EXPERIENCE EXISTENCE
AS WE DO.

446
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:17,451
ARCHER: SECURITY TO THE BRIDGE.

447
00:26:19,953 --> 00:26:23,082
YOU'RE TAKING OVER MY CREW. WHY?

448
00:26:23,123 --> 00:26:26,377
HOSHI: I UNDERSTAND HOW YOU
MAY BE FRIGHTENED BY ALL THIS--

449
00:26:26,419 --> 00:26:30,756
LOSING YOUR SUBSTANCE,
EXISTING AS PERCEPTIVE ENERGY--

450
00:26:30,797 --> 00:26:32,799
BUT YOU'LL BE GRATEFUL

451
00:26:32,841 --> 00:26:35,177
ONCE YOU'VE MADE THE CROSSING,
I PROMISE YOU.

452
00:26:35,219 --> 00:26:38,389
ARCHER: WE'RE KIND OF FOND
OF OUR SUBSTANCE.

453
00:26:38,431 --> 00:26:41,183
WE'RE NOT VERY ANXIOUS
TO GIVE IT UP.

454
00:26:41,225 --> 00:26:44,644
HOSHI: THOSE WHO'VE
PRECEDED YOU ARE SAFE AND HAPPY.

455
00:26:44,686 --> 00:26:46,522
YOU'LL UNDERSTAND.

456
00:26:46,564 --> 00:26:49,233
ARCHER: ARE YOU DOING THIS
FOR OUR BENEFIT OR FOR YOURS?

457
00:26:54,947 --> 00:26:58,492
ESCORT ENSIGN SATO
TO HER QUARTERS.

458
00:27:00,453 --> 00:27:02,538
HOSHI: YOU'LL UNDERSTAND.

459
00:27:08,168 --> 00:27:09,669
ARCHER: HOW MANY?

460
00:27:09,711 --> 00:27:12,923
T'POL: 58, INCLUDING US.
ARCHER: AND OUTSIDE?

461
00:27:12,965 --> 00:27:15,801
T'POL: 24 LOCKED IN
THEIR QUARTERS, AND DR. PHLOX.

462
00:27:15,842 --> 00:27:17,470
ARCHER: YOU OK, TRAVIS?

463
00:27:17,511 --> 00:27:19,263
TUCKER: I'M FINE, SIR.
THANK YOU.

464
00:27:19,305 --> 00:27:21,098
ARCHER: TRIP?

465
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:23,016
TRAVIS: I SAW HIM DOWN NEAR
THE COMMAND COMPARTMENT.

466
00:27:23,058 --> 00:27:25,436
ARCHER: THANKS.

467
00:27:25,478 --> 00:27:27,896
T'POL: WE NEED TO LEARN MORE
ABOUT THESE LIFE-FORMS.

468
00:27:27,938 --> 00:27:30,316
ARCHER: WHAT WE NEED IS TO GET
OUR PEOPLE BACK.

469
00:27:30,357 --> 00:27:32,485
T'POL: IT'S ILLOGICAL
TO BELIEVE WE CAN DO THAT

470
00:27:32,526 --> 00:27:35,321
WITHOUT LEARNING MORE
ABOUT THE ALIENS' INTENTIONS.

471
00:27:35,362 --> 00:27:37,364
ARCHER:
DO YOU HAVE SOMETHING IN MIND?

472
00:27:37,406 --> 00:27:39,116
T'POL: I'D LIKE YOUR PERMISSION
TO LEAVE THE CATWALK.

473
00:27:39,158 --> 00:27:41,076
ARCHER:
YOU WOULDN'T HAVE A CHANCE.

474
00:27:41,118 --> 00:27:42,911
ONE OF THOSE THINGS
WOULD TAKE YOU

475
00:27:42,953 --> 00:27:44,662
BEFORE YOU GOT BACK
TO THE SAUCER SECTION.

476
00:27:44,704 --> 00:27:46,290
T'POL: NOT NECESSARILY.

477
00:27:46,332 --> 00:27:47,874
IF A LIFE-FORM ATTEMPTS

478
00:27:47,916 --> 00:27:49,543
TO EXCHANGE ITS CONSCIOUSNESS
WITH MINE,

479
00:27:49,585 --> 00:27:51,003
I BELIEVE I CAN PREVENT IT.

480
00:27:51,044 --> 00:27:53,046
ARCHER:
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK THAT?

481
00:27:53,088 --> 00:27:55,007
NO OFFENSE, CAPTAIN,
BUT THE VULCAN MIND

482
00:27:55,048 --> 00:27:57,176
IS FAR MORE DISCIPLINED
THAN YOURS.

483
00:27:57,217 --> 00:28:00,513
IT CAN RESIST TEMPTATIONS,
EMOTIONS,

484
00:28:00,554 --> 00:28:03,140
AND, I BELIEVE,
INVASIONS BY THESE LIFE-FORMS.

485
00:28:05,725 --> 00:28:07,478
ARCHER: EVEN IF YOU'RE RIGHT,

486
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:09,313
WHAT WOULD YOU ACCOMPLISH?

487
00:28:09,355 --> 00:28:11,649
T'POL: IF AN ALIEN ATTEMPTS
THIS TRANSFER,

488
00:28:11,731 --> 00:28:14,692
THERE MAY BE A BRIEF PERIOD WHEN
OUR MINDS ARE CONJOINED.

489
00:28:14,734 --> 00:28:17,112
IT'S POSSIBLE I COULD
ASCERTAIN THEIR MOTIVES.

490
00:28:17,154 --> 00:28:19,114
ARCHER: IT'S TOO DANGEROUS.
I WON'T LET YOU DO IT.

491
00:28:19,156 --> 00:28:20,698
T'POL: THERE'S NO OTHER CHOICE.

492
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:22,201
ARCHER: AND IF YOU'RE WRONG?

493
00:28:22,242 --> 00:28:24,370
T'POL: IT'S A RISK
I'M WILLING TO TAKE.

494
00:28:24,411 --> 00:28:27,498
ARCHER: WELL, I'M NOT.
THEY'VE ALREADY TAKEN 24 PEOPLE.

495
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:30,125
I'M NOT GONNA GIVE THEM
ANOTHER ONE.

496
00:28:30,167 --> 00:28:33,546
T'POL: YOU'VE TOLD ME
YOU TRUST MY JUDGMENT.

497
00:28:33,587 --> 00:28:36,423
TRUST IT NOW UNLESS YOU
HAVE ANOTHER SUGGESTION.

498
00:28:38,258 --> 00:28:40,469
[COMPUTER BEEPS]

499
00:28:42,471 --> 00:28:43,889
PHLOX: SICK BAY.

500
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:47,142
HOSHI: There's been an accident.
PHLOX: HOSHI?

501
00:28:47,184 --> 00:28:49,144
HOSHI:
Hoshi Sato's been injured.

502
00:28:49,186 --> 00:28:51,230
I don't know how to repair
the damage to her body.

503
00:28:51,271 --> 00:28:52,898
PHLOX: WHAT HAPPENED?

504
00:28:52,939 --> 00:28:54,733
HOSHI: Her leg is fractured.

505
00:28:54,774 --> 00:28:57,528
She's in considerable pain.
She needs assistance.

506
00:29:08,914 --> 00:29:11,124
PHLOX: I'M ARMED.

507
00:29:11,166 --> 00:29:13,043
IF YOU'RE NEAR THE DOOR,
STEP AWAY.

508
00:29:13,085 --> 00:29:17,089
HOSHI: She's on the floor.
She can't move.

509
00:29:47,327 --> 00:29:49,996
PHLOX: THERE'S NOTHING
