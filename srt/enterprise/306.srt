MAN: <i>Hoshi.</i>

4
00:00:11,594 --> 00:00:12,804
Hello?

5
00:00:18,935 --> 00:00:20,770
MAN: <i>Do you understand me?</i>

6
00:00:27,694 --> 00:00:29,612
<i>I think you do.</i>

7
00:00:33,491 --> 00:00:35,035
Can you see me?

8
00:00:37,871 --> 00:00:39,539
Ensign Sato to Security.

9
00:00:39,622 --> 00:00:41,332
MAN:<i> Go ahead.</i>

10
00:00:41,416 --> 00:00:43,418
<i>Hoshi?</i>

11
00:00:43,501 --> 00:00:45,003
<i>Is everything all right?</i>

12
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:47,213
<i>Hoshi?</i>

13
00:02:16,177 --> 00:02:19,055
ARCHER: I thought I was the only one
who lived here during my off hours.

14
00:02:20,557 --> 00:02:21,683
I'd like you to see this.

15
00:02:21,766 --> 00:02:23,059
( beeping )

16
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:27,188
{\an8}These are the locations
where we've encountered spatial anomalies.

17
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:31,651
{\an8}I analyzed the sensor logs
from the Xindi database.

18
00:02:31,734 --> 00:02:35,196
{\an8}These are the coordinates
where that vessel was affected.

19
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,656
{\an8}Seems pretty random.

20
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:38,366
{\an8}That's what I thought...

21
00:02:38,449 --> 00:02:41,077
{\an8}Until I ran a vector analysis
of the gravimetric waves

22
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:43,246
{\an8}coming from the sphere we discovered.

23
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:47,041
{\an8}The interference patterns
implied another wave source.

24
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:53,131
{\an8}A second sphere?

25
00:02:53,214 --> 00:02:55,675
{\an8}It appears so.

26
00:02:55,758 --> 00:02:57,719
{\an8}The simulation suggests

27
00:02:57,802 --> 00:03:01,097
{\an8}that the anomalies occur
where the waves intersect.

28
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:04,267
{\an8}If you're right, then we should
be able to start predicting

29
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:05,935
{\an8}where we're going to run into trouble.

30
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:08,187
{\an8}If we're going to create an accurate map,

31
00:03:08,271 --> 00:03:11,316
{\an8}we'll need precise measurements
of the sphere's gravimetric fields.

32
00:03:11,399 --> 00:03:16,613
{\an8}Assuming there is a second sphere,
how far away is it?

33
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:18,573
{\an8}Less than four light-years.

34
00:03:19,824 --> 00:03:21,242
{\an8}Set a course.

35
00:03:30,793 --> 00:03:32,170
{\an8}Nothing?

36
00:03:32,253 --> 00:03:34,255
{\an8}MALCOLM: I ran every scan in the book.

37
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:36,966
{\an8}There's no sign of any intruder
anywhere on the ship.

38
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:39,427
{\an8}Maybe our sensors missed something.

39
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:41,971
{\an8}I went through all the logs
for the past 24 hours.

40
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:44,891
{\an8}To say they were uneventful
would be an understatement.

41
00:03:44,974 --> 00:03:46,392
{\an8}This is good news.

42
00:03:46,476 --> 00:03:48,811
{\an8}That I'm imagining things?

43
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:50,230
{\an8}Well, you're a little on edge.

44
00:03:50,313 --> 00:03:53,900
It's not uncommon to see the enemy
out of the corner of your eye.

45
00:03:53,983 --> 00:03:56,110
I thought that was called paranoia.

46
00:03:56,194 --> 00:03:59,948
Whatever it is, it's not uncommon.

47
00:04:00,031 --> 00:04:01,574
Just the other night,

48
00:04:01,658 --> 00:04:04,702
I thought I heard clicking sounds
in my quarters.

49
00:04:04,786 --> 00:04:07,330
For a moment, I could have sworn

50
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:09,457
there was a Xindi-insectoid
lurking in the shadows.

51
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:12,460
What I saw wasn't a shadow.

52
00:04:13,378 --> 00:04:17,298
All right. I'll keep an eye out.

53
00:04:17,382 --> 00:04:19,050
( footsteps receding )

54
00:04:21,469 --> 00:04:25,139
There's a mild vasodilation
in the prefrontal cortex.

55
00:04:25,223 --> 00:04:26,849
That would account for your headaches.

56
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:29,060
Other than that, you're in perfect health.

57
00:04:29,143 --> 00:04:32,105
Are there any more tests that you can run?

58
00:04:32,188 --> 00:04:33,940
What do you expect me to find?

59
00:04:34,023 --> 00:04:35,400
The last few days,

60
00:04:35,483 --> 00:04:39,153
I've had the strangest feeling
that I'm being watched.

61
00:04:40,446 --> 00:04:45,034
I've heard whispering down corridors,
in my quarters.

62
00:04:46,577 --> 00:04:49,622
Could I have been exposed to something
that's making me hallucinate?

63
00:04:50,331 --> 00:04:53,418
There's no evidence
of any mind-altering substances on board.

64
00:04:53,876 --> 00:04:55,837
So basically, this is all in my head.

65
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,588
It appears to be.

66
00:04:57,964 --> 00:04:59,007
Great.

67
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:02,302
I suppose you believe
you're dealing badly with stress.

68
00:05:03,219 --> 00:05:06,556
It's not a good sign when you start
to see things that aren't there.

69
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:07,724
( chuckles )

70
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:10,184
Well, that's a matter of opinion.

71
00:05:10,268 --> 00:05:13,479
On Denobula, when a person
under stress hallucinates,

72
00:05:13,563 --> 00:05:15,064
it's considered healthy...

73
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:19,736
a harmless way for the subconscious
to release nervous energy.

74
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:21,529
I've always envied those
who had that facility.

75
00:05:21,612 --> 00:05:24,365
I tend to keep too much bottled up inside.

76
00:05:25,742 --> 00:05:27,201
I should get going.

77
00:05:27,285 --> 00:05:30,496
T'Pol's asked me to translate
a section of the Xindi database.

78
00:05:36,085 --> 00:05:37,837
( beeping )

79
00:05:42,133 --> 00:05:43,593
MAN: <i>Hoshi.</i>

80
00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:49,432

81
00:05:51,142 --> 00:05:53,144
( whispering )
<i>That's where I'm waiting for you.</i>

82
00:05:53,227 --> 00:05:56,981
<i>That's where I'm waiting for you.</i>

83
00:05:57,065 --> 00:05:58,066
( beeps )

84
00:05:58,149 --> 00:06:00,026
Ensign Sato to Lieutenant Reed.

85
00:06:00,109 --> 00:06:01,652
I need help in the command center.

86
00:06:01,736 --> 00:06:03,071
MAN: Hoshi.

87
00:06:04,781 --> 00:06:05,990
Who are you?

88
00:06:06,074 --> 00:06:07,992
Don't be frightened.

89
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:09,911
( static crackles )

90
00:06:25,718 --> 00:06:27,136
Hoshi.

91
00:06:28,096 --> 00:06:29,514
( echoing ) How did you get on board?

92
00:06:29,597 --> 00:06:31,641
I'm nowhere near your ship.

93
00:06:33,142 --> 00:06:34,811
What do you want?

94
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:37,814
You're searching for something.
I can help.

95
00:06:52,453 --> 00:06:53,830
( gasps )

96
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:57,834
( grunts )

97
00:07:16,352 --> 00:07:19,397
Hoshi... Are you all right?

98
00:07:21,732 --> 00:07:24,735
I'm not picking up
anything out of the ordinary.

99
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:29,574
We still haven't found any ships nearby
or any uninvited guests on board.

100
00:07:29,657 --> 00:07:31,451
I'm not imagining it, Captain.

101
00:07:31,534 --> 00:07:33,202
You have to admit it's a possibility.

102
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:34,454
With respect, sir,

103
00:07:34,537 --> 00:07:36,873
I know that my mind
can be overactive sometimes,

104
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:38,791
but that is not what's happening.

105
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:40,334
This is real.

106
00:07:41,586 --> 00:07:46,007
I want you to keep Hoshi under observation
until we can sort this out.

107
00:07:47,758 --> 00:07:49,594
Post a security detail outside.

108
00:07:49,677 --> 00:07:52,680
And assign teams to engineering
and the armory until further notice.

109
00:07:52,763 --> 00:07:54,515
Are you expecting an attack, sir?

110
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:57,268
Around here, you never know.

111
00:07:59,395 --> 00:08:01,022
I'll see you both in the morning.

112
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:07,069
( sighs ) Isn't it about feeding time?

113
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:09,280
I'll take care of it
after I get you settled.

114
00:08:09,363 --> 00:08:12,033
Would you mind? I'm really not that tired.

115
00:08:12,116 --> 00:08:13,367
Be my guest.

116
00:08:13,451 --> 00:08:16,078
The Vulcan root leaf's in that container.

117
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:22,418
That's strange.

118
00:08:24,712 --> 00:08:26,130
It's...

119
00:08:27,882 --> 00:08:32,553
When the alien communicates
with me, it's...

120
00:08:32,637 --> 00:08:34,722
It's almost like he's inside my head,

121
00:08:34,805 --> 00:08:37,642
looking at things through my eyes,

122
00:08:37,725 --> 00:08:40,269
experiencing what I'm experiencing.

123
00:08:42,104 --> 00:08:44,774
And talking to him is...
is like talking to myself.

124
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:46,526
Does that make any sense?

125
00:08:46,609 --> 00:08:48,569
It makes perfect sense.

126
00:08:49,654 --> 00:08:52,281
Listening to your thoughts
has been very pleasurable.

127
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:53,741
What?

128
00:08:53,824 --> 00:08:56,327
I've been with you for several days...

129
00:08:56,410 --> 00:09:01,707
studying your mind, your memories,
learning so many things about you.

130
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:03,167
Why me?

131
00:09:03,251 --> 00:09:06,420
My telepathy only works in rare instances.

132
00:09:06,504 --> 00:09:09,048
It takes a unique mind to process it.

133
00:09:09,131 --> 00:09:12,301
Yours is the first I've found
in many years.

134
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:14,720
What do you want?

135
00:09:16,347 --> 00:09:18,933
I'm only three light-years away.

136
00:09:19,016 --> 00:09:21,686
My home is what you're seeing right now.

137
00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:24,564
All I want is to meet you.

138
00:09:24,647 --> 00:09:26,857
I don't think that'll be possible.

139
00:09:26,941 --> 00:09:29,360
I know you're on an urgent mission.

140
00:09:29,443 --> 00:09:31,445
That's what I want to talk to you about.

141
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:35,449
What did he tell you about the Xindi?

142
00:09:35,533 --> 00:09:37,243
He's saving that for my visit.

143
00:09:39,954 --> 00:09:43,541
He could have given you something
as a show of good faith.

144
00:09:43,624 --> 00:09:46,794
This could be another attempt by the Xindi
to infiltrate <i>Enterprise.</i>

145
00:09:46,877 --> 00:09:48,546
I think he wants to help.

146
00:09:48,629 --> 00:09:50,840
He was horrified that
seven million of us were killed.

147
00:09:50,923 --> 00:09:55,094
He says he's willing to use his abilities
to help us find the Xindi.

148
00:09:55,177 --> 00:09:57,388
I think that's reason enough
to meet with him.

149
00:10:04,103 --> 00:10:05,229
( beeps )

150
00:10:05,313 --> 00:10:06,439
Archer to Mayweather.

151
00:10:06,522 --> 00:10:07,940
MAYWEATHER: <i>Go ahead, sir.</i>

152
00:10:11,402 --> 00:10:13,237
We're taking a slight detour.

153
00:10:43,851 --> 00:10:45,895
( wind rushing )

154
00:11:09,794 --> 00:11:11,337
( doors creak shut )

155
00:11:15,424 --> 00:11:17,343
( doors creak )

156
00:11:23,724 --> 00:11:26,310
MAN: I asked Hoshi to come alone.

157
00:11:29,146 --> 00:11:32,650
The Captain's always a part
of first contact missions...

158
00:11:32,733 --> 00:11:34,693
Starfleet regulations.

159
00:11:34,777 --> 00:11:36,862
I hope that's not a problem.

160
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:39,198
Not at all, Captain.

161
00:11:39,281 --> 00:11:42,701
I'm pleased all three of you could come.

162
00:11:51,669 --> 00:11:54,839
My name is Tarquin.

163
00:11:54,922 --> 00:11:58,717
I'm obviously not what you expected.

164
00:11:58,801 --> 00:12:00,678
I didn't want to frighten you,

165
00:12:00,761 --> 00:12:04,473
so I created a human image
when I contacted you on <i>Enterprise.</i>

166
00:12:05,266 --> 00:12:08,144
Thank you for coming to me.

167
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:10,354
You said you could help us
with our mission.

168
00:12:11,355 --> 00:12:15,067
You're searching for a weapon
that could annihilate your planet.

169
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:17,486
I may be able to find it.

170
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:20,614
But I'll need an object
that's associated with the Xindi.

171
00:12:20,698 --> 00:12:21,824
Why?

172
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:27,079
Every artifact retains an imprint
of the people who made it, who used it.

173
00:12:28,038 --> 00:12:30,583
I have the ability to sense
those imprints.

174
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:34,044
I could arrange
to have something sent down.

175
00:12:34,128 --> 00:12:36,213
How much time would you need with it?

176
00:12:36,297 --> 00:12:37,715
No more than a few days.

177
00:12:38,466 --> 00:12:40,342
We didn't pick up any other bio-signs.

178
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:41,927
I take it you live here alone.

179
00:12:43,804 --> 00:12:45,055
Alone.

180
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:47,475
It's an awfully big planet for one person.

181
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:52,771
I've lived here for a very long time,
Mr. Reed.

182
00:12:52,855 --> 00:12:56,734
My only contact with the outside world
has been through telepathy.

183
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:01,489
Bring me the artifact.
I'd like to get started.

184
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:05,117
We'll be back as soon as we can.

185
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:08,746
Captain... One small request.

186
00:13:09,997 --> 00:13:12,625
I'd like Hoshi to stay with me
while I'm working.

187
00:13:15,586 --> 00:13:17,546
I'm afraid that's not appropriate.

188
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:21,550
Nonetheless,
it's a condition of my helping you.

189
00:13:27,348 --> 00:13:29,892
If I'm comfortable with this...

190
00:13:31,685 --> 00:13:33,729
I don't get the sense
that he would harm me.

191
00:13:33,812 --> 00:13:37,399
My instincts tell me otherwise.
He's hiding something.

192
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:41,237
If he's insistent,
we could put off looking for the sphere,

193
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,404
stay in orbit.

194
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:43,572
It's only for a few days.

195
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:45,074
We don't have the luxury

196
00:13:45,157 --> 00:13:48,118
of dealing with one problem
at a time anymore, sir.

197
00:13:48,202 --> 00:13:50,579
If he can tell us something
about the Xindi weapon,

198
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:52,456
it's worth the risk.

199
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:57,002
I can take care of myself, Captain.

200
00:14:04,385 --> 00:14:07,471
This is from the weapon
that attacked your planet.

201
00:14:07,555 --> 00:14:11,767
We think it was a prototype...
from a much larger weapon.

202
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:14,478
This will be very useful.

203
00:14:14,562 --> 00:14:15,813
May I?

204
00:14:16,605 --> 00:14:17,648
Thanks.

205
00:14:21,443 --> 00:14:22,695
I need a minute.

206
00:14:22,778 --> 00:14:25,489
( breathes deeply ) Take your time.

207
00:14:29,827 --> 00:14:31,704
Do I have to tell you
to stay on your toes?

208
00:14:31,787 --> 00:14:33,455
-( door closes )
-I think that falls

209
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:35,332
under the "goes without saying"
category, sir.

210
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:38,836
Did you bring a phase-pistol?

211
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:40,754
I'll keep it under my pillow.

212
00:14:44,925 --> 00:14:46,385
You know how to reach me.

213
00:14:47,261 --> 00:14:48,721
( footsteps receding )

214
00:15:01,817 --> 00:15:04,361
Do you always eat like this?

215
00:15:04,445 --> 00:15:06,614
Only when I have company.

216
00:15:09,992 --> 00:15:11,577
Thank you.

217
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:15,247
I thought you might enjoy
something familiar.

218
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:19,335
( lid clatters )

219
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:21,420
Programming these dishes was a challenge.

220
00:15:21,503 --> 00:15:25,341
I had to re-create their tastes
and textures from your memory.

221
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:27,843
Please.

222
00:15:32,848 --> 00:15:36,185
It should approximate
the recipe from Fiorella's

223
00:15:36,268 --> 00:15:39,313
on Fountain Street in San Francisco.

224
00:15:41,899 --> 00:15:44,193
You have certainly done your homework.

225
00:15:44,276 --> 00:15:46,278
I've enjoyed it.

226
00:15:46,362 --> 00:15:47,821
Mmm, what's this?

227
00:15:47,905 --> 00:15:49,323
Dessert.

228
00:15:49,406 --> 00:15:51,867
It's a delicacy from the Arakon system.

229
00:15:53,077 --> 00:15:55,120
I think you'll like it.

230
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:57,873
You know,
my stomach is a little unsettled.

231
00:15:57,957 --> 00:15:59,416
You told your grandmother that

232
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,752
every time she tried
to serve you soba noodles.

233
00:16:01,835 --> 00:16:04,880
Now it's one of your favorite foods.

234
00:16:05,589 --> 00:16:08,425
Since you seem to know
so much about my past,

235
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:10,928
I think it's only fair that
I know a little about yours.

236
00:16:11,595 --> 00:16:13,138
Where are you from?

237
00:16:13,222 --> 00:16:17,101
My homeworld
is 30 light-years from here...

238
00:16:17,184 --> 00:16:21,313
a wonderful place to live,
provided you're not born telepathic.

239
00:16:21,397 --> 00:16:25,442
( scoffs ) The odds are 1 in 50 million.

240
00:16:25,526 --> 00:16:28,821
I was among the unlucky few.

241
00:16:28,904 --> 00:16:32,116
We're considered a threat
to the rest of the population.

242
00:16:32,199 --> 00:16:34,952
There's only one solution
for people like me...

243
00:16:35,035 --> 00:16:37,997
To live out our lives in exile.

244
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:40,958
So we're sent to places like this...

245
00:16:42,126 --> 00:16:43,419
To solitude.

246
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:46,088
I think you're familiar with it.

247
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:47,464
What do you mean?

248
00:16:47,548 --> 00:16:51,760
Your parents learned you were gifted,

249
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:54,805
so you spent your childhood
with private tutors,

250
00:16:54,888 --> 00:16:57,057
studying languages.

251
00:16:57,141 --> 00:16:59,893
You thought it was normal
to go through your days alone.

252
00:17:03,897 --> 00:17:05,607
I'm sorry.

253
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:08,819
I forget you're unaware
of how much I know about you.

254
00:17:09,903 --> 00:17:12,990
Are you reading my mind continuously?

255
00:17:13,073 --> 00:17:15,159
Not since you've arrived.

256
00:17:15,242 --> 00:17:16,660
Now that you're here with me,

257
00:17:16,744 --> 00:17:19,872
I would rather get to know you
the way other humans do.

258
00:17:21,498 --> 00:17:24,209
This is great, but I'm pretty tired.

259
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:28,005
Of course

260
00:17:28,088 --> 00:17:29,757
( door opens )

261
00:17:32,509 --> 00:17:36,388
If you need anything else,
let me know at supper tomorrow.

262
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:38,974
I'll be working most of the day.

263
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:41,435
Uh, feel free to wander.

264
00:17:41,518 --> 00:17:45,022
There are a lot
of interesting things here,

265
00:17:45,105 --> 00:17:48,984
but I strongly suggest
that you stay inside.

266
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:51,653
The winds can be treacherous.

267
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:54,823
I'm sure there's enough
to keep me occupied.

268
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:58,869
If you'd like, y-y-you could
spend some time looking at this.

269
00:17:58,952 --> 00:18:02,122
It's written in a dead language,
over 1,000 years old.

270
00:18:02,206 --> 00:18:04,666
Everything about these people,
their homeworld,

271
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:07,377
their culture, has vanished into time.

272
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:10,255
Thank you.

273
00:18:14,384 --> 00:18:17,346
You don't have to feel alone.

274
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:20,432
I won't. I'll be busy with this.

275
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:22,601
That's not what I meant.

276
00:18:22,684 --> 00:18:27,106
You often feel isolated,
even around other people.

277
00:18:27,189 --> 00:18:29,983
You don't have to.

278
00:18:32,861 --> 00:18:34,530
( door opens, closes )

279
00:18:57,302 --> 00:18:58,762
-( communicator beeps )
-Archer to the bridge.

280
00:18:58,846 --> 00:19:00,514
T'POL: <i>Yes, Captain.</i>

281
00:19:00,597 --> 00:19:02,266
I assume we're getting close.

282
00:19:02,349 --> 00:19:04,476
<i>You assume correctly.</i>

283
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,562
Take us out of warp. I'm on my way.

284
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:07,771
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

285
00:19:13,902 --> 00:19:15,821
( indistinct conversations )

286
00:19:23,412 --> 00:19:25,164
( beeping )

287
00:19:26,415 --> 00:19:28,000
Status.

288
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:29,793
We're getting reports
of anomalies on all decks.

289
00:19:29,877 --> 00:19:31,378
-( electricity crackles )
-( man screams )

290
00:19:36,466 --> 00:19:37,467
( yells )

291
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:43,932
( electricity crackling )

292
00:19:50,147 --> 00:19:52,274
I got you.

293
00:19:52,357 --> 00:19:54,234
There are breaches
on decks "B", "C", and "E".

294
00:19:54,318 --> 00:19:55,652
Emergency bulkheads are in place,

295
00:19:55,736 --> 00:19:58,322
but three subsections have decompressed.

296
00:19:58,405 --> 00:20:00,574
( rumbling )

297
00:20:06,079 --> 00:20:08,373
We're losing structural integrity
in the forward hull.

298
00:20:08,457 --> 00:20:09,666
All stop!

299
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:13,045
The anomalies are stronger here.

300
00:20:13,128 --> 00:20:15,005
If there is another sphere in the region,

301
00:20:15,088 --> 00:20:18,133
it's emitting a lot more
gravimetric energy than the first one.

302
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:19,885
Which means, if we continue,

303
00:20:19,968 --> 00:20:23,013
there's a good chance this ship
is gonna get torn apart.

304
00:20:24,014 --> 00:20:25,682
If it is there, how far?

305
00:20:25,766 --> 00:20:28,143
Approximately 75,000 kilometers.

306
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:30,729
Might as well be 75,000 light-years.

307
00:20:32,606 --> 00:20:34,316
-( communicator beeps )
-Bridge to Commander Tucker.

308
00:20:34,483 --> 00:20:35,359
TUCKER: <i>Go ahead.</i>

309
00:20:35,442 --> 00:20:40,030
-How are your engines holding up?
-So far, so good.

310
00:20:40,113 --> 00:20:42,407
But I wouldn't recommend putting them
through a lot more of this.

311
00:20:42,491 --> 00:20:45,827
How long would it take you
to insulate a shuttlepod with trellium-D?

312
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:47,913
I'd need a day to refine enough ore

313
00:20:47,996 --> 00:20:51,124
and, uh, at least 12 hours
to reconfigure the hull.

314
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:52,292
Get started.

315
00:20:52,376 --> 00:20:53,502
<i>Aye, sir.</i>

316
00:20:53,585 --> 00:20:55,837
Hold our position.

317
00:20:55,921 --> 00:20:57,589
You might want to steer clear
of the launch bay

318
00:20:57,673 --> 00:20:59,007
for the next couple of days.

319
00:20:59,716 --> 00:21:00,842
Indeed.

320
00:21:27,828 --> 00:21:30,080
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to disturb you.

321
00:21:30,163 --> 00:21:31,456
Not at all.

322
00:21:32,582 --> 00:21:33,750
Please.

323
00:21:39,423 --> 00:21:41,466
( doors creaking )

324
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:48,056
Have you had a chance to look
at the book I gave you?

325
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:49,725
I'm about halfway through.

326
00:21:49,808 --> 00:21:52,936
I didn't expect you
to translate it so quickly.

327
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:54,980
Aren't you supposed to know me
better than that?

328
00:21:55,063 --> 00:21:57,899
( chuckles ) What did you think of it?

329
00:21:59,026 --> 00:22:03,238
It's an interesting language...
reminds me of medieval Klingon.

330
00:22:04,281 --> 00:22:05,490
Any progress?

331
00:22:05,949 --> 00:22:09,745
A few images, impressions.

332
00:22:09,828 --> 00:22:12,706
Did you know that
there are five Xindi species?

333
00:22:12,789 --> 00:22:14,166
That's what we've heard.

334
00:22:14,249 --> 00:22:16,460
A great deal of conflict among them.

335
00:22:16,543 --> 00:22:18,253
They don't trust one another.

336
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:20,630
Do you know where
they're building the weapon?

337
00:22:21,673 --> 00:22:24,885
Not yet. I'm going to need more time.

338
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:28,889
What's this?

339
00:22:31,099 --> 00:22:34,102
It helps me extend
the range of my telepathy.

340
00:22:34,186 --> 00:22:36,980
My family gave it to me when I was exiled.

341
00:22:37,481 --> 00:22:40,150
Without it, I never would have found you.

342
00:22:44,154 --> 00:22:45,947
Would you like to try?

343
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:47,365
Is that possible?

344
00:22:47,991 --> 00:22:49,534
With guidance.

345
00:23:06,593 --> 00:23:11,681
If you close your eyes,
you'll begin to sense light and color.

346
00:23:12,182 --> 00:23:18,105
Let the images take shape,
and let the shapes become more distinct.

347
00:23:19,064 --> 00:23:23,735
-Can you see them?
-I think so.

348
00:23:23,819 --> 00:23:26,947
You're trying too hard to find them.

349
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:29,282
Let the images come to you.

350
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:58,436
How do you make sense of all that?

351
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:01,982
It takes practice. Try again.

352
00:24:04,943 --> 00:24:06,444
Maybe later.

353
00:24:06,987 --> 00:24:09,322
I should let you get back to your work.

354
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:16,246
Uh, feel free to return...
If you'd like some company.

355
00:24:16,997 --> 00:24:18,290
Thanks.

356
00:24:59,998 --> 00:25:02,125
( wind rushing )

357
00:25:14,554 --> 00:25:17,390
I asked you to stay inside!

358
00:25:17,474 --> 00:25:19,893
Is this why you didn't want me out here?

359
00:25:19,976 --> 00:25:21,144
Who are they?

360
00:25:21,228 --> 00:25:22,437
They're people I knew.

361
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:25,065
The last one died over a century ago.

362
00:25:25,148 --> 00:25:26,149
We should go inside.

363
00:25:26,233 --> 00:25:27,776
How did they die?

364
00:25:27,859 --> 00:25:32,030
Very few lifespans are as long as mine.

365
00:25:32,113 --> 00:25:33,323
How old are you?

366
00:25:33,406 --> 00:25:36,868
I was born over 400 years ago.

367
00:25:36,952 --> 00:25:38,203
Who were they?

368
00:25:38,995 --> 00:25:41,957
The first one was Morianna Taal.

369
00:25:43,041 --> 00:25:45,669
She was my first companion.

370
00:25:45,752 --> 00:25:49,130
Like you, she had a unique mind.

371
00:25:51,007 --> 00:25:52,425
And the other three?

372
00:25:52,509 --> 00:25:54,761
Companions as well.

373
00:25:54,844 --> 00:25:56,304
When I lost Morianna,

374
00:25:56,388 --> 00:26:00,600
I-I began to search for another...
And another.

375
00:26:00,684 --> 00:26:02,352
( sighs )

376
00:26:02,435 --> 00:26:05,313
Sometimes, I don't know what is worse...

377
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:10,402
being alone or having to bury the people
I've come to care about.

378
00:26:10,485 --> 00:26:13,446
It's been many years
since I found someone like you.

379
00:26:13,947 --> 00:26:16,324
You're right. We should go back inside.

380
00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:19,494
All I'm asking is that
you consider the possibility.

381
00:26:19,577 --> 00:26:22,163
You know that <i>Enterprise</i>
is on an important mission.

382
00:26:22,247 --> 00:26:24,374
I just can't abandon my duties.

383
00:26:24,457 --> 00:26:27,669
It's possible that, with my help,
your mission will be over soon.

384
00:26:27,752 --> 00:26:30,463
Do you really expect me
to spend the rest of my life

385
00:26:30,547 --> 00:26:31,881
on a desolate world

386
00:26:31,965 --> 00:26:34,718
with someone that I have known
for less than two days?

387
00:26:34,801 --> 00:26:36,219
The others had similar doubts.

388
00:26:36,303 --> 00:26:37,762
But over time,

389
00:26:37,846 --> 00:26:40,557
they came to appreciate
what I had to offer them.

390
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:44,477
No one will ever understand you
the way I can.

391
00:26:44,561 --> 00:26:46,062
I am grateful for your help,

392
00:26:46,146 --> 00:26:48,106
and I'm happy to stay here while you work,

393
00:26:48,189 --> 00:26:51,234
but I have no intention
of becoming your next companion.

394
00:26:59,034 --> 00:27:01,911
( breathing deeply )

395
00:27:01,995 --> 00:27:03,997
If you think projecting yourself as human

396
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:06,791
is going to make me change my mind,
you're mistaken.

397
00:27:06,875 --> 00:27:10,462
You've let your fear of the unknown
stand in your way far too many times.

398
00:27:10,545 --> 00:27:12,714
You almost left <i>Enterprise</i>
early in its mission

399
00:27:12,797 --> 00:27:15,216
because you didn't think
you could control your fears.

400
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:17,761
But in spite of that, you stayed.

401
00:27:17,844 --> 00:27:19,846
It strengthened you.

402
00:27:19,929 --> 00:27:22,766
This situation is no different.

403
00:27:22,849 --> 00:27:25,810
You obviously misinterpreted
a few memories,

404
00:27:25,894 --> 00:27:28,146
because this situation is very different.

405
00:27:28,229 --> 00:27:29,939
I'm giving you the chance
to experience something

406
00:27:30,023 --> 00:27:32,484
you've searched for your entire life.

407
00:27:32,567 --> 00:27:37,280
It's the reason you study languages,
to make unique connections with people.

408
00:27:37,364 --> 00:27:40,200
I don't need you to help me do that.

409
00:27:40,283 --> 00:27:43,620
Then why do you seem so isolated?

410
00:27:43,703 --> 00:27:46,956
You live on a ship
filled with your own people,

411
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:50,794
and yet there are many times
when you feel alone.

412
00:27:50,877 --> 00:27:52,962
Stay with me.

413
00:27:53,046 --> 00:27:58,093
I'll teach you ways of sharing
thoughts and emotions no human can.

414
00:28:00,428 --> 00:28:03,598
I already told you, I'm not interested.

415
00:28:03,681 --> 00:28:05,892
You're lying, Hoshi.

416
00:28:05,975 --> 00:28:08,520
I can hear everything you're thinking.

417
00:28:08,603 --> 00:28:10,980
What I'm thinking
is none of your business!

418
00:28:11,064 --> 00:28:12,399
Michio.

419
00:28:13,691 --> 00:28:15,610
Your grandfather...

420
00:28:15,693 --> 00:28:18,613
He's the last person
you were truly close to.

421
00:28:18,696 --> 00:28:20,490
But he died a long time ago.

422
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:22,158
Leave me alone.

423
00:28:22,242 --> 00:28:24,536
You can have
that kind of connection again.

424
00:28:24,619 --> 00:28:26,079
Leave me alone!

425
00:28:27,831 --> 00:28:29,165
I'm sorry.

426
00:28:29,249 --> 00:28:32,627
I know this must seem overwhelming.

427
00:28:32,710 --> 00:28:34,671
Think about what I've said.

428
00:28:34,754 --> 00:28:36,965
You're going to have a great deal of time.

429
00:28:50,145 --> 00:28:51,271
( beeping )

430
00:28:51,354 --> 00:28:55,316
Sensors say we're passing through
a gravimetric distortion.

431
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:57,485
( beeping )

432
00:29:00,447 --> 00:29:02,240
No anomalies.

433
00:29:02,949 --> 00:29:05,702
Trellium seems to be doing its job.

434
00:29:05,785 --> 00:29:08,121
-( communicator beeps )
-Archer to <i>Enterprise.</i>

435
00:29:08,204 --> 00:29:09,789
T'POL: <i>Go ahead.</i>

436
00:29:09,873 --> 00:29:13,793
We're approaching 79,000 kilometers.

437
00:29:13,877 --> 00:29:16,087
Still no sign of the cloaking barrier.

438
00:29:16,171 --> 00:29:19,174
Adjust your heading to 016 mark 2.

439
00:29:19,883 --> 00:29:20,925
ARCHER: <i>Stand by.</i>

440
00:29:26,264 --> 00:29:27,474
( rumbling )

441
00:29:27,557 --> 00:29:29,976
( beeping )

442
00:29:30,059 --> 00:29:32,353
That felt promising.

443
00:29:32,437 --> 00:29:34,481
I believe you just grazed the perimeter.

444
00:29:34,564 --> 00:29:36,691
Turn starboard, 3.6 degrees.

445
00:29:39,861 --> 00:29:41,029
( beeping )

446
00:29:41,112 --> 00:29:42,447
I think we've found it.

447
00:29:42,530 --> 00:29:44,240
T'POL:<i> Maintain course.</i>

448
00:29:44,324 --> 00:29:46,993
<i>You should be heading directly</i>
<i>toward the cloaking barrier.</i>

449
00:29:48,369 --> 00:29:49,621
Power's fluctuating!

450
00:29:49,704 --> 00:29:51,122
( beeping )

451
00:29:56,961 --> 00:29:58,421
Hull integrity?

452
00:29:58,505 --> 00:30:00,924
Some micro-fractures,
but nothing we can't handle.

453
00:30:04,594 --> 00:30:06,429
TUCKER: Switching to backup!

454
00:30:10,683 --> 00:30:12,519
( beeping )

455
00:30:13,937 --> 00:30:15,313
Trip.

456
00:30:23,446 --> 00:30:25,573
Let's get going with the scans.

457
00:30:27,784 --> 00:30:29,452
( buzzing )

458
00:30:29,536 --> 00:30:30,787
TUCKER: Ah, hell!

459
00:30:30,870 --> 00:30:32,288
Is there a problem?

460
00:30:32,372 --> 00:30:34,415
The sensor relays were damaged.

461
00:30:35,583 --> 00:30:37,335
How much time do you need?

462
00:30:37,418 --> 00:30:39,921
Not long,
but we'll have to get back to <i>Enterprise.</i>

463
00:30:40,004 --> 00:30:42,090
I need to open up the circuit
housings on the undercarriage--

464
00:30:42,173 --> 00:30:44,092
No way to get to them from the inside.

465
00:30:47,178 --> 00:30:49,514
Bring the descent thrusters online.

466
00:30:52,016 --> 00:30:54,352
You're not planning to land on that thing?

467
00:30:54,435 --> 00:30:58,106
Thrusters, Trip,
and get the E.V. suits ready.

468
00:31:09,284 --> 00:31:10,618
( grunts )

469
00:31:13,162 --> 00:31:15,832
TUCKER:
Not exactly my idea of shore leave.

470
00:31:17,041 --> 00:31:20,837
ARCHER: Get to work.
I'm gonna take a look around.

471
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:21,921
TUCKER: Don't get lost.

472
00:31:22,005 --> 00:31:23,548
( chuckles )

473
00:31:36,185 --> 00:31:37,937
ARCHER: How's it coming, Trip?

474
00:31:38,021 --> 00:31:41,107
Almost there, sir. Just two more relays.

475
00:31:42,942 --> 00:31:44,986
-( electricity crackles )
-( yells )

476
00:31:45,069 --> 00:31:46,738
Captain!

477
00:31:47,614 --> 00:31:48,823
( hissing )

478
00:31:54,871 --> 00:31:56,331
What happened?

479
00:31:56,414 --> 00:31:57,790
The port thruster ignited.

480
00:31:57,874 --> 00:31:59,167
I can see that.

481
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:00,835
When I was bypassing the last relay,

482
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:03,046
I must have triggered a surge
in the propulsion system.

483
00:32:03,129 --> 00:32:04,672
Son of a bitch!

484
00:32:07,008 --> 00:32:08,593
It's going to be a long time

485
00:32:08,676 --> 00:32:11,220
before <i>Enterprise </i>decides
to come looking for us.

486
00:32:11,304 --> 00:32:13,056
Can we launch without a port thruster?

487
00:32:13,139 --> 00:32:14,641
We can sure as hell try.

488
00:32:17,435 --> 00:32:19,437
ARCHER: Whoever gets the first clear shot.

489
00:32:22,482 --> 00:32:25,652
Careful, sir. That was awfully
close to the O2 recycler.

490
00:32:29,948 --> 00:32:32,325
I need to spend more time in the armory.

491
00:32:46,589 --> 00:32:48,007
( metal screeching )

492
00:33:02,063 --> 00:33:03,147
( communicator beeps )

493
00:33:03,231 --> 00:33:05,316
<i>Archer to </i>Enterprise.

494
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:06,859
We're here, Captain.

495
00:33:06,943 --> 00:33:08,945
<i>It was right where you said it was, T'Pol.</i>

496
00:33:09,028 --> 00:33:11,280
<i>We got all the scans you asked for.</i>

497
00:33:13,449 --> 00:33:15,535
ARCHER: <i>Captain's starlog, supplemental.</i>

498
00:33:15,618 --> 00:33:18,162
<i>While T'Pol analyzes the data</i>
<i>from the sphere,</i>

499
00:33:18,246 --> 00:33:20,456
<i>we've set a course to pick up Ensign Sato</i>

500
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:23,751
<i>and find out if the alien </i>
<i>learned anything about the Xindi.</i>

501
00:33:26,796 --> 00:33:28,089
( knocking on door )

502
00:33:28,172 --> 00:33:29,465
( door opens )

503
00:33:30,967 --> 00:33:34,178
May I come in? I won't be long.

504
00:33:34,262 --> 00:33:35,805
I just heard from your captain.

505
00:33:36,389 --> 00:33:39,350
<i>Enterprise </i>will be here in a few minutes.

506
00:33:39,434 --> 00:33:42,437
I have learned a great deal
about the Xindi weapon.

507
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:45,398
I'm sure he'll find
the information useful.

508
00:33:45,481 --> 00:33:47,650
Thank you for all your help.

509
00:33:49,277 --> 00:33:51,821
Have you given any more
thought to my offer?

510
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:55,199
I can't stay here. You know that.

511
00:33:56,242 --> 00:33:57,535
I understand.

512
00:33:58,619 --> 00:34:01,122
I was foolish to think
it was even a possibility.

513
00:34:02,373 --> 00:34:05,209
The next time you invite
someone for a visit,

514
00:34:05,293 --> 00:34:06,794
you might want to let them know

515
00:34:06,878 --> 00:34:08,880
that you're looking
for a lifelong companion.

516
00:34:10,423 --> 00:34:11,758
I won't forget.

517
00:34:12,633 --> 00:34:13,885
Uh...

518
00:34:13,968 --> 00:34:19,182
Please keep the book
as a reminder of your time here.

519
00:34:20,141 --> 00:34:21,726
I was hoping you'd say that.

520
00:34:21,809 --> 00:34:24,979
I'm nearly done,
and I'm anxious to see how it ends.

521
00:34:25,855 --> 00:34:29,317
After I've briefed Captain Archer,
I'll send him to you.

522
00:34:30,359 --> 00:34:32,904
It was a privilege knowing you.

523
00:34:51,672 --> 00:34:53,091
How was your stay?

524
00:34:53,174 --> 00:34:55,426
I'm eager to get back to <i>Enterprise.</i>

525
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:57,261
I'm sure.

526
00:34:57,345 --> 00:35:00,473
If it's any consolation,
your time here was well spent.

527
00:35:01,682 --> 00:35:04,268
We've learned more about
the Xindi than I expected.

528
00:35:05,186 --> 00:35:08,356
And he's offered to keep
supplying us with information

529
00:35:08,439 --> 00:35:11,400
for as long as we're in range,
thanks to you.

530
00:35:11,484 --> 00:35:13,319
Glad I could help, sir.

531
00:35:14,946 --> 00:35:17,073
There is one condition.

532
00:35:18,241 --> 00:35:21,786
He wants you to stay with him
while he continues his work.

533
00:35:21,869 --> 00:35:24,288
I assume you told him
that wouldn't be possible.

534
00:35:25,373 --> 00:35:28,251
I won't order you to do this, Hoshi,

535
00:35:29,001 --> 00:35:31,879
but it may be our best chance
of finding the weapon

536
00:35:31,963 --> 00:35:33,965
before it's too late.

537
00:35:34,048 --> 00:35:38,344
With any luck, it'll only take
a few weeks, maybe a month.

538
00:35:40,012 --> 00:35:43,141
We'd come back for you
as soon as the mission's over.

539
00:35:44,517 --> 00:35:47,270
I don't need to tell you
what's at stake, Ensign.

540
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:55,945
I'll go back to my quarters
and pick up a few things.

541
00:35:56,028 --> 00:35:57,321
Thank you, Hoshi.

542
00:35:57,405 --> 00:35:59,866
There's no reason for you to leave.

543
00:35:59,949 --> 00:36:02,743
Just give me a list of what you need,
and I'll have it sent down.

544
00:36:03,202 --> 00:36:06,122
I should brief my replacement
on the U.T. upgrades.

545
00:36:06,205 --> 00:36:08,166
We'll take care of it. Don't worry.

546
00:36:08,249 --> 00:36:10,626
At least give me a chance
to say goodbye to the crew.

547
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:12,253
I wish there was time.

548
00:36:12,336 --> 00:36:15,548
It won't take long, sir.
I might not see my friends again.

549
00:36:15,631 --> 00:36:17,466
I'm sure Travis will understand.

550
00:36:19,468 --> 00:36:20,595
Travis?

551
00:36:21,012 --> 00:36:22,722
Travis and the others.

552
00:36:22,805 --> 00:36:24,473
They realize how important this is.

553
00:36:25,391 --> 00:36:27,560
I was just thinking about Travis.

554
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,355
You're a regular mind reader.

555
00:36:31,814 --> 00:36:33,691
We've known each other a long time.

556
00:36:34,442 --> 00:36:36,319
Where is Captain Archer?

557
00:36:36,819 --> 00:36:40,823
We'll be back for you as soon as we can.

558
00:36:40,907 --> 00:36:42,074
Where is he?

559
00:36:42,158 --> 00:36:43,159
Hoshi.

560
00:36:43,242 --> 00:36:45,870
-Where is Captain Archer?
-Hoshi.

561
00:36:45,953 --> 00:36:48,039
Open a channel to Ensign Sato.

562
00:36:48,623 --> 00:36:50,499
( beeping )

563
00:36:50,583 --> 00:36:52,835
Our signal's not getting through, sir.

564
00:36:52,919 --> 00:36:55,046
There's some kind of disruption field.

565
00:36:56,214 --> 00:36:57,423
MALCOLM: Sir.

566
00:36:57,506 --> 00:36:58,925
ARCHER: What's going on?

567
00:36:59,008 --> 00:37:00,718
My station's down.

568
00:37:02,011 --> 00:37:03,721
Everything's going off-line...

569
00:37:03,804 --> 00:37:08,851
Main and auxiliary power,
warp engines, life support.

570
00:37:08,935 --> 00:37:10,728
( electricity humming )

571
00:37:11,771 --> 00:37:13,022
Nice try.

572
00:37:13,105 --> 00:37:16,025
What were you planning to tell
my captain when he got back?

573
00:37:16,108 --> 00:37:18,653
Were you gonna appear as me
and beg him to let you stay?

574
00:37:18,736 --> 00:37:20,571
No, you can't do that, can you?

575
00:37:20,655 --> 00:37:23,908
I'm the only one on board
that you can play your tricks with.

576
00:37:23,991 --> 00:37:26,953
<i>Enterprise</i> has already returned.

577
00:37:27,036 --> 00:37:28,829
Their fate is in your hands.

578
00:37:28,913 --> 00:37:30,539
What is that supposed to mean?

579
00:37:30,623 --> 00:37:32,833
I can't let you leave, Hoshi.

580
00:37:32,917 --> 00:37:34,877
I've waited too long to find you.

581
00:37:35,294 --> 00:37:37,213
What's happened to <i>Enterprise?</i>

582
00:37:37,296 --> 00:37:40,716
If you agree to stay,
they won't be harmed.

583
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:43,094
They'll be free to leave orbit.

584
00:37:43,177 --> 00:37:45,304
Let me speak to Captain Archer.

585
00:37:45,388 --> 00:37:46,722
That's not possible.

586
00:37:46,806 --> 00:37:48,182
Why the hell not?

587
00:37:49,225 --> 00:37:52,228
You'll be happy here, I promise you.

588
00:37:52,311 --> 00:37:54,897
Why can't I speak to Captain Archer?

589
00:37:54,981 --> 00:37:57,817
There's no power on your vessel,

590
00:37:57,900 --> 00:38:01,153
and there won't be until
you agree to remain with me.

591
00:38:02,321 --> 00:38:06,367
You would kill over 80 people
to keep me here?

592
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:09,287
I don't want to kill anyone.

593
00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:12,498
That's why it's essential
that you agree to stay.

594
00:38:18,129 --> 00:38:19,338
You mustn't do that.

595
00:38:19,422 --> 00:38:20,589
( breathing heavily )

596
00:38:20,673 --> 00:38:21,924
It's very fragile.

597
00:38:22,258 --> 00:38:24,051
I'm counting on that.

598
00:38:24,135 --> 00:38:26,512
Now undo whatever you've done to my ship,

599
00:38:26,595 --> 00:38:29,307
or you will never contact
anyone again with this thing.

600
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:31,017
An empty threat, Hoshi.

601
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:34,145
As long as you're with me,
I won't need to contact anyone else.

602
00:38:34,228 --> 00:38:37,356
As long as I'm with you...
another 60, 70 years?

603
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:38,607
Then what?

604
00:38:38,691 --> 00:38:41,193
What'll you do when
I'm grave number five out there?

605
00:38:41,277 --> 00:38:44,405
Without this,
you will never find another companion.

606
00:38:44,905 --> 00:38:47,783
You will be alone
for the rest of your life.

607
00:38:47,867 --> 00:38:51,203
Please, think of what I can offer you.

608
00:38:51,287 --> 00:38:53,122
This is your last chance.

609
00:38:59,086 --> 00:39:00,963
( electricity humming )

610
00:39:06,052 --> 00:39:07,345
ARCHER: Report.

611
00:39:07,428 --> 00:39:08,929
Power's returning to all systems.

612
00:39:09,013 --> 00:39:10,056
Malcolm?

613
00:39:10,139 --> 00:39:11,932
Weapons are coming back online.

614
00:39:12,016 --> 00:39:13,225
Tactical alert.

615
00:39:13,309 --> 00:39:14,310
Aye, sir.

616
00:39:14,393 --> 00:39:15,644
( beeping )

617
00:39:15,728 --> 00:39:16,937
It's Ensign Sato.

618
00:39:17,021 --> 00:39:18,397
Put her through.

619
00:39:18,481 --> 00:39:20,566
HOSHI: <i>Captain, are you all right?</i>

620
00:39:20,649 --> 00:39:22,693
We are now. What the hell's going on?

621
00:39:22,777 --> 00:39:25,154
<i>I think it's time to come get me.</i>

622
00:39:25,988 --> 00:39:27,907
ARCHER: <i>Captain's starlog, supplemental.</i>

623
00:39:27,990 --> 00:39:30,242
<i>Ensign Sato has returned to </i>Enterprise,

624
00:39:30,326 --> 00:39:32,661
<i>but without any new information</i>
<i>on the Xindi.</i>

625
00:39:32,745 --> 00:39:36,415
<i>I'm hoping T'Pol's analysis of</i>
<i>the second sphere will bring better news.</i>

626
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:38,751
What have you got?

627
00:39:38,834 --> 00:39:40,628
The data you collected
allowed me to create

628
00:39:40,711 --> 00:39:43,130
a nearly accurate map of the anomalies.

629
00:39:43,214 --> 00:39:44,423
Nearly?

630
00:39:44,507 --> 00:39:48,469
These are the coordinates
where we've encountered strong anomalies.

631
00:39:49,053 --> 00:39:51,055
The waves aren't intersecting
where they're supposed to.

632
00:39:51,138 --> 00:39:54,016
Exactly.
The locations are being influenced

633
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:56,102
by more than two gravimetric sources.

634
00:39:57,269 --> 00:39:58,646
A third sphere?

635
00:39:58,729 --> 00:40:00,731
A third sphere would correct
some of the error,

636
00:40:00,815 --> 00:40:02,024
but not all of it.

637
00:40:02,108 --> 00:40:05,111
So I had the computer run
a covariant extrapolation.

638
00:40:16,455 --> 00:40:17,832
How many?

639
00:40:17,915 --> 00:40:20,835
We'll need to get farther
into the expanse to be certain, but...

640
00:40:22,211 --> 00:40:23,504
At least 50.

641
00:40:25,923 --> 00:40:30,261
Fifty man-made spheres,
each one the size of a small moon.

642
00:40:30,344 --> 00:40:34,932
And each one generating massive
amounts of gravimetric energy.

643
00:40:35,015 --> 00:40:40,354
Did it ever occur to you
that whoever built these things

644
00:40:40,438 --> 00:40:43,190
may have done it to create the expanse?

645
00:40:44,108 --> 00:40:48,946
Why would someone want to create
a web of crippling anomalies?

646
00:40:58,414 --> 00:40:59,623
What are you doing here?

647
00:40:59,707 --> 00:41:01,417
Did you enjoy the ending?

648
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:04,753
You can't do this.
I don't want you watching me.

649
00:41:05,379 --> 00:41:08,048
This is the last time... I promise.

650
00:41:09,467 --> 00:41:13,137
I've brought you information
to give to your captain.

651
00:41:13,679 --> 00:41:15,055
Why now?

652
00:41:15,139 --> 00:41:19,310
You're on a dangerous mission.
I don't want to see you harmed.

653
00:41:19,977 --> 00:41:22,188
( chuckles ) Who knows?

654
00:41:22,271 --> 00:41:24,899
You may change your mind about me someday.

655
00:41:28,861 --> 00:41:30,821
-( door chimes )
-Come in.

656
00:41:33,616 --> 00:41:35,242
I thought I told you to get some rest.

657
00:41:35,326 --> 00:41:36,577
He came to my quarters.

658
00:41:37,328 --> 00:41:38,954
I was afraid that might happen.

659
00:41:39,038 --> 00:41:40,664
He gave me these coordinates.

660
00:41:42,166 --> 00:41:44,919
-What are they for?
-A Xindi colony.

661
00:41:45,628 --> 00:41:47,963
He said they're building part
of the weapon there.
