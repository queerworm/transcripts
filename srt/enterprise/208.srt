OF THE ALLIANCE.

522
00:40:19,334 --> 00:40:21,127
THEY NOW BELIEVE THEIR ENEMY

523
00:40:21,169 --> 00:40:23,796
IS CAPABLE OF CREATING
GENETICALLY ENHANCED SOLDIERS,

524
00:40:23,838 --> 00:40:26,549
NOT TO MENTION PARTICLE WEAPONS.

525
00:40:26,591 --> 00:40:31,054
AND THANKS TO THAT SULIBAN SHIP,
THEY ALSO THINK THE ALLIANCE

526
00:40:31,096 --> 00:40:34,724
HAS DEVELOPED
INVISIBLE AIRCRAFT.

527
00:40:34,766 --> 00:40:36,517
YOU DON'T HAVE TO LEAVE
TECHNOLOGY BEHIND

528
00:40:36,559 --> 00:40:38,395
TO CONTAMINATE A CULTURE.

529
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:55,245
YOU WERE WILLING TO SACRIFICE
YOUR LIFE TO PROTECT THEM.

530
00:40:56,996 --> 00:40:59,958
I WOULD NOT HAVE EXPECTED THAT.

531
00:41:12,095 --> 00:41:14,472
AH, YOU ARE MAKING
EXCELLENT PROGRESS.

532
00:41:14,513 --> 00:41:16,182
YEAH? WHAT ABOUT THIS?

533
00:41:16,224 --> 00:41:17,850
OH, THAT'S NOTHING.

534
00:41:17,892 --> 00:41:19,311
MAYBE NOTHING TO YOU.

535
00:41:19,352 --> 00:41:22,647
GIVE IT TIME, HMM?
GIVE IT TIME.

536
00:41:22,688 --> 00:41:25,317
[ SIGHS ]

537
00:41:25,358 --> 00:41:27,485
THANKS, DOC.
