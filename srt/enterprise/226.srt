307
00:17:53,406 --> 00:17:54,615
ARCHER: I KNOW.

308
00:17:54,657 --> 00:17:57,117

00:17:59,871 --> 00:18:02,749
TELL ME,
THIS TIME TRAVELER YOU MET,

311
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:05,209
WAS HE HUMANOID?

00:18:05,251 --> 00:18:07,086
ARCHER:
HOW DO YOU KNOW ABOUT THAT?

313
00:18:07,127 --> 00:18:08,755
FER'AT: I WAS BRIEFED
BEFORE COMING HERE.

314
00:18:08,796 --> 00:18:10,423
ARCHER: HE SEEMED HUMANOID,

315
00:18:10,464 --> 00:18:12,132
BUT I COULDN'T SEE HIM
THAT WELL.

316

PEOPLE FROM THE FUTURE BEFORE?

00:18:14,176 --> 00:18:15,762
ARCHER: A NUMBER OF TIMES.

318
00:18:15,803 --> 00:18:18,014
DOES THIS HAVE ANYTHING TO DO
WITH THE RADIATION?

319
00:18:18,056 --> 00:18:19,807
FER'AT: I WAS JUST CURIOUS.

320
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:23,644
IT MUST BE VERY DIFFICULT

321
00:18:23,686 --> 00:18:26,397
TO HAVE SO MANY PEOPLE
QUESTION YOUR STORY.

322
00:18:26,439 --> 00:18:27,607
DOES IT UPSET YOU?

323
00:18:27,648 --> 00:18:28,983
ARCHER: DOESN'T HELP.

324
00:18:29,025 --> 00:18:30,526
FER'AT:
BUT HOW DOES IT MAKE YOU FEEL?

325
00:18:30,568 --> 00:18:32,904
ARCHER:
I TOLD YOU, IT DOESN'T HELP.

326
00:18:32,946 --> 00:18:37,533
FER'AT: I CAN SENSE SOME
ANGER WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THIS.

327
00:18:37,575 --> 00:18:38,993
ARCHER: IT'S KIND OF STRANGE
THAT A VULCAN

328
00:18:39,035 --> 00:18:42,038
WOULD BE SO INTERESTED
IN MY FEELINGS.

329
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,915
FER'AT: JUST CURIOUS.

330
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:46,709
YOUR EXPOSURE SEEMS MINIMAL.

331
00:18:46,751 --> 00:18:48,795
YOU'LL REQUIRE
VERY LITTLE TREATMENT.

332
00:18:48,836 --> 00:18:51,380
I IMAGINE YOU MUST HAVE FELT
VERY ANXIOUS

333
00:18:51,422 --> 00:18:53,340
AFTER MEETING SOMEONE
FROM THE FUTURE.

334
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:55,009

IMAGINE THAT?

338
00:19:00,098 --> 00:19:01,348
I JUST CHECKED
THE VULCAN DATABASE.
