OUT OF THE EXPANSE,

-TO OUR ADVANTAGE.
-HOW?

00:11:25,977 --> 00:11:29,189

A GENERATIONAL SHIP.

HOW TO OPERATE

AND MAINTAIN ITS SYSTEMS,

212
00:11:35,153 --> 00:11:37,405

FOR THEIR CHILDREN.

215
00:11:43,786 --> 00:11:45,580

FOR FOOD AND SUPPLIES.

222

A FEW ALIEN CREW MEMBERS.

00:12:04,849 --> 00:12:07,810
THE MISSION YOU GAVE US,

THE FIRST XINDI PROBE.

226

BUT YOU FAILED.

00:12:15,026 --> 00:12:17,070
WE HAD YEARS TO PREPARE,

228
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:20,156
BUT IN THE END,
WE WERE ONLY ONE STARSHIP.

229
00:12:20,156 --> 00:12:21,658

FOR THE XINDI.

WITH DEGRA THIS TIME.

DOZENS OF SPECIES.

SOME OF THEM SHARED THEIR
PROPULSION TECHNOLOGY WITH US.

237

WE GOT THESE SCHEMATICS
FROM HARADIN TRADERS.

238
00:12:42,053 --> 00:12:44,514

YOUR INJECTOR ASSEMBLY.

YOU'RE STILL NOT CONVINCED.

BEEN ABLE TO REPRODUCE.
