COMMANDER TUCKER AND I
WILL BE LONG DEAD.

179
00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:34,115
IT'S MY INTENTION TO RECOUNT
THE EVENTS THAT LED TO

180
00:09:34,157 --> 00:09:36,784
THE DESTRUCTION
OF THE STARSHIP<i> ENTERPRISE</i>

181
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:39,787
AND TO EXPRESS
MY DEEPEST FEELINGS

182
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:42,749
REGARDING MY SHORT BUT MEMORABLE
SERVICE WITH STARFLEET.

183
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:44,959
TELL THEM I'D LOVE
TO ADD MY TWO CENTS,

184
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:47,754

A LITTLE WORK DONE.

188

COMMANDER TUCKER
AND I HAD TO GET

189
00:10:00,183 --> 00:10:03,644
AT LEAST 20,000 KILOMETERS
FROM<i> ENTERPRISE.</i>

190
00:10:03,686 --> 00:10:06,314
DURING OUR THIRD TRIAL,
WE EXPERIENCED

191
00:10:06,356 --> 00:10:09,901
A BRIEF BUT SIZABLE JOLT
AND, SHORTLY THEREAFTER,

192
00:10:09,943 --> 00:10:12,112
REALIZED THAT OUR SENSOR ARRAY
HAD GONE OFFLINE.

193
00:10:12,153 --> 00:10:13,905
TUCKER: THIS SENSOR ARRAY IS
MORE THAN OFFLINE.

194
00:10:13,947 --> 00:10:15,574
IT'S TOTALLY FRIED.

<i>...THAT OUR SENSOR ARRAY</i>
<i>HAD GONE OFFLINE.</i>

197
00:10:22,747 --> 00:10:25,625
WE HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO HEAD
BACK TO THE ASTEROID FIELD

198
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:28,753
WHERE<i> ENTERPRISE</i> WAS INVOLVED
IN A MAPPING PROJECT.

199
00:10:28,795 --> 00:10:33,049
WE FOUND THE SHIP...DESTROYED,

200
00:10:33,091 --> 00:10:35,760
ITS DEBRIS STREWN
ACROSS A SQUARE KILOMETER

201
00:10:35,802 --> 00:10:37,971
OF ONE OF THE LARGER ASTEROIDS.

202
00:10:38,012 --> 00:10:40,765
HAD OUR SENSORS BEEN WORKING,
WE CERTAINLY WOULD HAVE DONE

203
00:10:40,807 --> 00:10:45,395
EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO DETERMINE
THE CAUSE OF THE DISASTER...

204
00:10:45,437 --> 00:10:48,440
BUT AS IT WAS, WITH ONLY
A SHORT-RANGE DISTRESS BEACON

205
00:10:48,482 --> 00:10:50,275
AND LIMITED AIR,

206
00:10:50,317 --> 00:10:54,028
WE HAD NO ALTERNATIVE BUT
TO SET A COURSE FOR ECHO III,

207
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:55,989
WHERE, SOMEDAY, THIS VESSEL --

208
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:59,117

WILL BE FOUND.

00:11:00,368 --> 00:11:02,662
MAY GOD HAVE MERCY ON OUR SOULS.

210
00:11:02,703 --> 00:11:05,665
WHY DON'T YOU CUT THE CRAP
AND GET BACK HERE AND HELP ME?

211
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:11,087
WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO DO?

212
00:11:11,129 --> 00:11:12,380
I DON'T KNOW.

213
00:11:12,422 --> 00:11:13,965
YOU COULD HOLD THIS FLASHLIGHT

214
00:11:14,007 --> 00:11:16,176

TO ALL YOUR PESSIMISM.

IF THERE'S SOMETHING
YOU NEED ME TO DO,

218
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:23,016
I WOULD BE MORE
THAN HAPPY TO COMPLY,

219
00:11:23,057 --> 00:11:24,892

IS SIMPLY NOT

TO BE RUNNING INTO ANY PLANETS,

CAN RUN INTO US.

TWICE IN THE WEEKS

NEVER RECEIVED THOSE LETTERS.

YOU WERE, I BELIEVE,
IN THE PROCESS OF MOVING

265

SHARE MY BELIEF

TO SAY WHAT MUST BE SAID,

277
00:14:38,753 --> 00:14:41,756

TIE UP LOOSE ENDS.

AND THAT I'LL NEVER GET
AN ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION,

GOING TO TELL ME WHAT HAPPENED,

320

I SUPPOSE A SIMPLE "GOOD NIGHT"
WILL HAVE TO DO.

IGNORE COURAGE...

AND THIS VULCAN...

323
00:17:20,915 --> 00:17:24,168
WILL NEVER IGNORE

00:17:27,672 --> 00:17:30,216
IGNORED YOU, T'POL.

326
00:17:30,257 --> 00:17:33,302

BUT, IF THE TRUTH BE KNOWN,

331
00:17:41,561 --> 00:17:45,231
I'VE...NEVER MUCH CARED
FOR THE NAME MALCOLM.

332
00:17:45,272 --> 00:17:49,235
ALWAYS SEEMED A BIT
TOO...STUFFY.

333
00:17:49,276 --> 00:17:52,822
I THINK IT'S A LOVELY NAME.

334
00:17:52,864 --> 00:17:56,617
<i>MOL-KOM</i> IS THE VULCAN WORD
