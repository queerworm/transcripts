I NEED TO LEAVE BEHIND --

1368
01:23:42,392 --> 01:23:48,148
THINGS LIKE PRECONCEPTIONS,
HOLDING GRUDGES.

1369
01:23:49,608 --> 01:23:53,111
THIS MISSION WOULD'VE FAILED
WITHOUT YOUR HELP.

1370
01:23:53,111 --> 01:23:55,614
I WON'T DISPUTE THAT.

1371
01:23:57,491 --> 01:24:00,327
I WAS THINKING.

1372
01:24:00,327 --> 01:24:04,581
A VULCAN SCIENCE OFFICER
COULD COME IN HANDY.

1373
01:24:04,581 --> 01:24:06,166
BUT IF I ASK YOU TO STAY,

1374
01:24:06,166 --> 01:24:09,419
IT MIGHT LOOK LIKE I WASN'T
READY TO DO THIS ON MY OWN.

1375
01:24:09,419 --> 01:24:12,631
PERHAPS YOU SHOULD
ADD PRIDE TO YOUR LIST.

1376
01:24:12,631 --> 01:24:15,050
PERHAPS I SHOULD.

1377
01:24:15,050 --> 01:24:20,472
IT MIGHT BE BEST IF
I WERE TO CONTACT MY SUPERIORS

1378
01:24:20,472 --> 01:24:23,183
AND MAKE THE REQUEST MYSELF...

1379
01:24:23,183 --> 01:24:25,060
WITH YOUR PERMISSION.

1380
01:24:26,436 --> 01:24:28,856
PERMISSION GRANTED.

1381
01:24:39,950 --> 01:24:45,288
I HOPE NOBODY IS
IN A BIG HURRY TO GET HOME.

1382
01:24:45,288 --> 01:24:46,707
STARFLEET SEEMS TO THINK

1383
01:24:46,707 --> 01:24:48,959
THAT WE'RE READY
TO BEGIN OUR MISSION.

1384
01:24:51,127 --> 01:24:54,214
I UNDERSTAND THERE'S
AN INHABITED PLANET

1385
01:24:54,214 --> 01:24:56,174
A FEW LIGHT-YEARS FROM HERE.

1386
01:24:56,174 --> 01:24:57,593
REED: WE'VE DETECTED IT, SIR.

1387
01:24:57,593 --> 01:25:00,220
SENSORS SHOW
A NITROGEN-SULFIDE ATMOSPHERE.

1388
01:25:00,220 --> 01:25:02,264
PROBABLY NOT HUMANOIDS.

1389
01:25:02,264 --> 01:25:03,933
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE HERE
TO FIND OUT.

1390
01:25:03,933 --> 01:25:07,477
PREPARE TO BREAK ORBIT
AND LAY IN A COURSE.

1391
01:25:09,145 --> 01:25:13,233
I'M READING AN ION STORM
ON THAT TRAJECTORY, SIR.

1392
01:25:13,233 --> 01:25:16,403
SHOULD I GO AROUND IT?

1393
01:25:16,403 --> 01:25:20,407
WE CAN'T BE AFRAID
OF THE WIND, ENSIGN.

1394
01:25:20,407 --> 01:25:23,201
TAKE US TO WARP 4.
