00:01:09,027 --> 00:01:11,696
( telephone rings )

2
00:01:27,086 --> 00:01:28,254
Hello?

3
00:01:28,338 --> 00:01:30,215
MALE XINDI: <i>Have you made your selection?</i>

4
00:01:30,298 --> 00:01:33,802
Y-yeah, yeah. It's all set.
Just like we discussed.

5
00:01:33,885 --> 00:01:35,678
<i>We'll be expecting you.</i>

6
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:38,389
And, um... And the money?
Same as last time, right?

7
00:01:38,473 --> 00:01:42,185
MALE XINDI: The same.
Be careful with the sedative.

8
00:01:42,268 --> 00:01:44,187
You nearly killed the last one.

9
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:46,481
MAN: <i>100 milligrams.</i>
<i>Don't worry. I'll get it right.</i>

10
00:01:46,564 --> 00:01:48,525
MALE XINDI: We'll be expecting you.

31
00:03:30,793 --> 00:03:32,503
You looking for a date, honey?

32
00:03:33,004 --> 00:03:34,130
Maybe with your friend.

33
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:39,135
{\an8}You don't know what you're missing.

34
00:03:41,888 --> 00:03:43,389
{\an8}He's all yours.

35
00:03:47,602 --> 00:03:48,811
{\an8}Ooh!

36
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:51,272
{\an8}What can I do for you, sweetheart?

37
00:03:51,773 --> 00:03:54,776
{\an8}Hey, I know you. From this morning.

38
00:03:54,859 --> 00:03:56,277
{\an8}You brought me the apple juice.

39
00:03:56,361 --> 00:03:58,571
{\an8}-What?
-At the clinic.

40
00:03:59,364 --> 00:04:02,200
{\an8}Oh, yeah. Now I remember.

41
00:04:02,283 --> 00:04:03,326
{\an8}( chuckles )

42
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:04,786
{\an8}Small world, huh?

43
00:04:05,536 --> 00:04:08,122
{\an8}-Want me to get in?
-Sure. Yeah.

44
00:04:11,626 --> 00:04:14,170
{\an8}-Bye, girl.
-Have fun.

45
00:04:21,135 --> 00:04:24,222
{\an8}There's a nice place to park
right in the neighborhood.

46
00:04:24,305 --> 00:04:26,224
{\an8}Turn left at the next light.

47
00:04:32,897 --> 00:04:35,275
{\an8}Georgia Tandy. "O" negative.

48
00:04:35,358 --> 00:04:37,360
{\an8}How the hell would you remember that?

49
00:04:41,906 --> 00:04:43,658
Uh, it's another two blocks.

50
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:48,871
If that's drugs, I am not interested.

51
00:04:51,624 --> 00:04:52,959
What you got in there?

52
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:54,752
Come here.

53
00:04:54,836 --> 00:04:56,629
( muffled screaming )

54
00:05:00,008 --> 00:05:01,259
( screaming stops )

55
00:05:01,342 --> 00:05:04,387
There you go. There you go.

56
00:05:24,866 --> 00:05:26,784
It's OK.

57
00:05:26,868 --> 00:05:29,662
They said they won't hurt you.

58
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:44,886
( buzzes )

59
00:05:44,969 --> 00:05:46,054
MALE XINDI: <i>Yes?</i>

60
00:05:46,137 --> 00:05:47,430
Loomis.

61
00:05:48,514 --> 00:05:49,891
( buzzes )

62
00:06:47,573 --> 00:06:50,535
There you go. Nice and comfy.

63
00:07:55,558 --> 00:07:57,143
( Porthos barks )

64
00:07:57,226 --> 00:07:58,686
Good boy.

65
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:05,234
Cheese?

66
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:13,075
( barks )

67
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:14,452
This is your last piece.

68
00:08:14,535 --> 00:08:15,745
It's OK.

69
00:08:17,455 --> 00:08:19,207
How have you been, Jonathan?

70
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:23,336
It's about time you showed up.

71
00:08:24,253 --> 00:08:26,797
Our mission has changed quite a bit
since the last time I saw you,

72
00:08:26,881 --> 00:08:28,174
but I suppose you're aware of it.

73
00:08:28,633 --> 00:08:30,510
I am.

74
00:08:30,593 --> 00:08:33,387
Maybe you could fill in
a few of the blanks for me.

75
00:08:34,222 --> 00:08:37,391
The Xindi weapon would be
a good place to start.

76
00:08:37,475 --> 00:08:39,018
We don't know any more than you do.

77
00:08:39,435 --> 00:08:41,687
I thought you and your colleagues

78
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:44,565
were supposed to be
keeping an eye on the timeline.

79
00:08:44,649 --> 00:08:46,692
You're from the 30th century.

80
00:08:46,776 --> 00:08:48,194
Hasn't all this happened already?

81
00:08:48,277 --> 00:08:52,573
History doesn't mention anything
about a conflict between humans and Xindi.

82
00:08:52,657 --> 00:08:53,783
How could that be?

83
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:56,661
The events that are taking place
are the result of temporal incursions.

84
00:08:56,744 --> 00:08:58,287
They are not supposed to be happening.

85
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:00,289
-But they are happening.
-Yes, they are.

86
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:02,750
But the outcome hasn't reached us yet.

87
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:05,419
It takes a while for changes
to ripple through the timeline.

88
00:09:05,503 --> 00:09:08,839
The time traveler...
the man the Suliban work for...

89
00:09:08,923 --> 00:09:10,633
What about him?

90
00:09:10,716 --> 00:09:13,970
He's the one who told us
about the weapon being built.

91
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:16,764
-Should I believe him?
-You have no reason not to.

92
00:09:16,847 --> 00:09:20,434
You said I'm supposed to play
some crucial part in history.

93
00:09:20,518 --> 00:09:22,311
Does this have something to do with it?

94
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:24,605
I wish I could say that it does,
but I don't know.

95
00:09:24,689 --> 00:09:27,441
I told you,
none of this was supposed to happen.

96
00:09:27,525 --> 00:09:29,443
You're not being very helpful!

97
00:09:32,655 --> 00:09:34,532
Why are you here?

98
00:09:34,615 --> 00:09:37,493
We've detected three Xindi
where they're not supposed to be.

99
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:40,121
This expanse is filled with Xindi.

100
00:09:40,204 --> 00:09:42,081
I'm not talking about the expanse.

101
00:09:42,164 --> 00:09:44,333
I'm talking about Detroit, Michigan.

102
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:46,711
150 years ago.

103
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:48,504
( door chimes )

104
00:09:54,885 --> 00:09:56,304
( door chimes )

105
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:02,059
Sorry to get you up,
but this couldn't wait.

106
00:10:02,143 --> 00:10:03,144
Come in.

107
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:15,531
I just had a visit from Daniels.

108
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:21,287
I think all your doubts about time travel
are about to go out the window.

109
00:10:21,996 --> 00:10:23,164
Meaning?

110
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:29,045
Daniels and his team
have discovered three reptilians on Earth.

111
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:31,213
In the early 21st century.

112
00:10:31,672 --> 00:10:34,550
He wants to send us back
to find out what they're doing.

113
00:10:35,009 --> 00:10:36,052
Us?

114
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:38,638
He told me I could bring one person,
no more.

115
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:41,766
If Daniels is the time traveler
he claims to be,

116
00:10:41,849 --> 00:10:43,893
why doesn't he find out for himself?

117
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:47,980
It took him a long while
to get permission to interact with me.

118
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:49,690
There are clearances.

119
00:10:49,774 --> 00:10:51,651
He said it would take too much time.

120
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:55,237
I would think he would have
all the time in the world.

121
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:59,742
He said the three Xindi traveled
to Earth from our century.

122
00:10:59,825 --> 00:11:01,786
They've been there for two months.

123
00:11:03,746 --> 00:11:06,123
They're not sightseeing, T'Pol.

124
00:11:06,207 --> 00:11:08,417
We have to find out what they're up to.

125
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:10,294
How are we supposed to accomplish this?

126
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:13,672
He wants us to meet him in
the command center at 0800 tomorrow.

127
00:11:18,594 --> 00:11:19,595
Come on, boy.

128
00:11:21,305 --> 00:11:23,182
Check the database.

129
00:11:23,265 --> 00:11:25,976
Find something to wear
that won't stand out in 2004.

130
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:27,561
( door opens )

131
00:11:33,567 --> 00:11:35,694
Last time Daniels
sent you to another century,

132
00:11:35,778 --> 00:11:36,946
you had one hell of a time getting back.

133
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:38,364
He gave me this.

134
00:11:38,447 --> 00:11:40,616
Said he'd return us
whenever we signaled him.

135
00:11:40,699 --> 00:11:42,827
These are temporal tags.

136
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:45,871
We can use them to bring back anything
that doesn't belong there.

137
00:11:46,414 --> 00:11:48,290
If anybody asks where you went,
what should I tell them?

138
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:51,377
With two shuttlepods in the bay,
it'll be hard to explain.

139
00:11:52,711 --> 00:11:54,380
I'm sure you'll think of something.

140
00:11:55,005 --> 00:11:57,508
-Try to stay out of trouble.
-You too.

141
00:11:57,591 --> 00:11:59,176
Here's the duty roster.

142
00:12:11,063 --> 00:12:13,232
We just traveled 90 light-years
back to Earth.

143
00:12:13,315 --> 00:12:16,152
And 150 years into the past.

144
00:12:17,862 --> 00:12:20,489
Forgive me if I'm not entirely convinced.

145
00:12:22,283 --> 00:12:24,118
You will be.

146
00:12:24,201 --> 00:12:25,786
Come on.

147
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:35,337
( beeping )

148
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:38,257
This one has a motion-activated
security system.

149
00:12:39,341 --> 00:12:40,551
( beeping )

150
00:12:41,677 --> 00:12:43,721
This one too.

151
00:12:43,804 --> 00:12:45,764
( chirping )

152
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:56,066
We're in.

153
00:12:57,735 --> 00:12:59,069
This apparatus...

154
00:13:01,155 --> 00:13:04,366
It appears to have been designed
to incapacitate the vehicle.

155
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:15,419
( beeping, chirping )

156
00:13:25,554 --> 00:13:26,889
( barking )

157
00:13:45,741 --> 00:13:47,076
( door unlocks )

158
00:13:56,752 --> 00:13:59,755
MAN ON RADIO: <i>Sunday! Sunday! Sunday!</i>
<i>At the tri-city speedway!</i>

159
00:13:59,838 --> 00:14:03,509
<i>An all-star lineup of all your</i>
<i>favorite monster mayhem...</i>

160
00:14:03,592 --> 00:14:04,718
( radio turns off )

161
00:14:07,137 --> 00:14:10,224
Have you ever operated a vehicle
from this period?

162
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:12,518
I can pilot a starship.

163
00:14:19,066 --> 00:14:21,360
"R," "N," "D," 2, 3, 4...

164
00:14:21,443 --> 00:14:24,029
I suggest you begin with 2.

165
00:14:29,493 --> 00:14:31,287
Foot controls.

166
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:32,705
( beeping )

167
00:14:46,468 --> 00:14:49,513
I don't believe you've activated
your external lighting.

168
00:14:57,563 --> 00:15:00,774
-What year is that map from?
-2002.

169
00:15:00,858 --> 00:15:03,986
It was the closest I could find
in the Starfleet database.

170
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:07,656
The layout shouldn't have
changed a lot in two years.

171
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:10,117
Turn starboard on 24th street.

172
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:13,871
If that thing has a scanning radius
of three kilometers,

173
00:15:13,954 --> 00:15:16,957
how far are we gonna have
to drive to cover the entire city?

174
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:21,879
I've created a search grid that requires
a journey of approximately 80 kilometers.

175
00:15:21,962 --> 00:15:25,090
But it's probable we'll find them
before we complete it.

176
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:38,395
What's that icon?

177
00:15:38,479 --> 00:15:41,315
It's a gasoline pump. We need to get fuel.

178
00:15:41,398 --> 00:15:44,360
-Where?
-Where isn't the problem.

179
00:15:45,402 --> 00:15:47,863
We're going to need money. U.S. currency.

180
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:50,157
That's going to be difficult
at this time of night.

181
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:53,994
Not necessarily.

182
00:15:55,496 --> 00:15:57,122
( beeping )

183
00:16:00,084 --> 00:16:02,461
( teller machine whirs, beeps )

184
00:16:05,005 --> 00:16:07,549
People used to go to jail for this.

185
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:10,094
We'll return what we don't use.

186
00:16:17,518 --> 00:16:19,269
( indistinct conversations )

187
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:34,618
( doorbell rings )

188
00:16:42,209 --> 00:16:44,086
-Yeah?
-Are you Lawrence Strode?

189
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:46,672
-Who are you?
-I'm from the blood bank.

190
00:16:46,755 --> 00:16:47,965
We had a screw-up this afternoon.

191
00:16:48,048 --> 00:16:49,258
We gave you the wrong papers to sign.

192
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:50,843
I'm not giving the money back.

193
00:16:50,926 --> 00:16:53,012
No, no, no, no, no.
They don't want the money back.

194
00:16:53,262 --> 00:16:54,763
In fact, they're gonna pay you again.

195
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:56,432
25 bucks.

196
00:16:56,765 --> 00:16:58,726
They just need you
to sign the right papers.

197
00:16:58,809 --> 00:17:01,061
-Did you bring them?
-No, they wouldn't let me.

198
00:17:01,145 --> 00:17:02,896
You got to do it
in front of the supervisor.

199
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:04,982
You know, the fat broad who paid you?

200
00:17:05,065 --> 00:17:06,442
They sent me to drive you down.

201
00:17:07,192 --> 00:17:08,944
-It's 11:00 at night.
-Yeah, I know.

202
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:10,988
They want to send your blood work out
first thing in the morning,

203
00:17:11,071 --> 00:17:13,574
and they can't do it
without the right paperwork.

204
00:17:15,909 --> 00:17:17,578
You want the 25 bucks or not?

205
00:17:17,661 --> 00:17:19,413
( indistinct talking on television )

206
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:23,584
( chain unlatches )

207
00:17:28,213 --> 00:17:31,550
Is this gonna take long?
I don't want to miss <i>Conan.</i>

208
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,344
Were they aware at this time

209
00:17:34,428 --> 00:17:37,639
that Earth's supply of fossil fuel
was nearing depletion?

210
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:40,350
They had been for 30 years.

211
00:17:40,434 --> 00:17:42,936
But it wasn't until 2061
that they finally--

212
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,396
( beeping )

213
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,939
One kilometer, straight ahead.

214
00:18:10,714 --> 00:18:14,343
Second structure from the left.
Three Xindi bio-signs.

215
00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:16,095
Any humans?

216
00:18:16,178 --> 00:18:18,806
Five. In another part of the building.

217
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:22,476
ARCHER:
This doesn't look very residential.

218
00:18:26,146 --> 00:18:27,815
Set your phase pistol to kill.

219
00:18:28,857 --> 00:18:31,735
When the reptilians boarded <i>Enterprise,</i>
stun had no effect.

220
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:39,284
See what you can find out.
I'll look over there.

221
00:18:40,244 --> 00:18:43,080
( communicator beeps )

222
00:18:43,163 --> 00:18:44,248
Go ahead.

223
00:18:44,331 --> 00:18:47,167
There's a neutronic power source
coming from the first floor.

224
00:18:47,251 --> 00:18:50,170
I found a gate
with an electric locking mechanism.

225
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:53,674
We shouldn't have a problem.

226
00:18:59,054 --> 00:19:00,681
Do you see the vehicle?

227
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:10,983
I see it.

228
00:19:13,318 --> 00:19:14,695
( buzzes )

229
00:19:14,778 --> 00:19:15,863
MALE XINDI: <i>Yes?</i>

230
00:19:15,946 --> 00:19:17,239
-Loomis.
-( buzzes )

231
00:19:38,218 --> 00:19:40,888
MALE XINDI: Did you disinfect your hands?

232
00:19:41,638 --> 00:19:43,932
I insert IVs all day. I told you that.

233
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:47,060
If there are any infections here,
it won't be because of me.

234
00:19:49,479 --> 00:19:50,772
You forget something?

235
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:52,816
We've decided to compensate you

236
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:56,236
for the final three patients
in one payment.

237
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,530
That's not what we agreed.

238
00:19:58,614 --> 00:20:00,324
You said I'd get paid for each one.

239
00:20:00,407 --> 00:20:04,494
Bring us the last two blood types,
and you will be compensated.

240
00:20:05,287 --> 00:20:08,790
We should wait a while.
A few more days at least.

241
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:10,626
There was something on the news.

242
00:20:10,709 --> 00:20:13,587
Cops are starting to get complaints
that people have gone missing.

243
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:16,131
We can't wait a few more days.

244
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:18,133
We need the last two.

245
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:19,676
Look, as soon as they figure out

246
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,220
that all these people here
have been to the clinic,

247
00:20:21,303 --> 00:20:23,722
it won't take a rocket scientist
to point the finger at me.

248
00:20:23,805 --> 00:20:26,308
Then I suggest
you finish your work quickly.

249
00:20:26,391 --> 00:20:28,769
Look, I don't know
what you guys are up to,

250
00:20:28,852 --> 00:20:30,020
and I don't want to know.

251
00:20:30,103 --> 00:20:32,147
It's not my business.

252
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:35,484
But the cops don't take kindly
to people who help terrorists.

253
00:20:35,567 --> 00:20:36,902
I got to be real careful.

254
00:20:36,985 --> 00:20:39,571
We will double your fee
for the final three.

255
00:20:39,655 --> 00:20:43,116
But the last two must be here by tomorrow.

256
00:20:43,617 --> 00:20:44,785
Double?

257
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:49,039
Tomorrow?

258
00:20:49,665 --> 00:20:52,209
Yeah. All right.

259
00:20:52,292 --> 00:20:53,585
I'll have them here by tomorrow.

260
00:21:04,471 --> 00:21:05,806
Here he comes.

261
00:22:06,658 --> 00:22:07,951
Ninth floor.

262
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:12,164
280 pounds.

263
00:22:16,209 --> 00:22:18,420
William Myers.

264
00:22:19,379 --> 00:22:20,839
Second floor.

265
00:22:21,757 --> 00:22:22,924
( knock on door )

266
00:23:06,551 --> 00:23:08,095
( grunts, gasps )

267
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:18,688
And the man in the wheelchair?

268
00:23:19,314 --> 00:23:21,399
Why were you bringing him
to an abandoned factory

269
00:23:21,483 --> 00:23:22,734
in the middle of the night?

270
00:23:22,818 --> 00:23:24,611
I swear, I don't know
what you're talking about.

271
00:23:25,821 --> 00:23:26,988
What's this?

272
00:23:28,865 --> 00:23:30,033
Oh.

273
00:23:30,117 --> 00:23:32,369
Oh, I took that from the clinic.

274
00:23:32,452 --> 00:23:35,288
I work at the blood bank on Porter Street.

275
00:23:35,372 --> 00:23:37,499
Check with them. They'll tell you.
I've been there for over a year.

276
00:23:37,582 --> 00:23:40,836
-Why would you take it?
-Make a few extra bucks.

277
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:43,046
There's plenty of people on the street
looking for that stuff.

278
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:44,256
Really?

279
00:23:45,173 --> 00:23:49,678
Why would anyone on the street
be interested in acquiring methohexital?

280
00:23:49,761 --> 00:23:51,888
You make it a habit
of climbing out your window

281
00:23:51,972 --> 00:23:53,306
when someone knocks on the door?

282
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:54,558
I don't like cops.

283
00:23:57,769 --> 00:23:59,855
Tell us about your friends
on Carpenter Street.

284
00:23:59,938 --> 00:24:02,482
I've never been to Carpenter Street.

285
00:24:02,566 --> 00:24:05,485
You were there an hour ago
with a man in a wheelchair.

286
00:24:05,569 --> 00:24:07,612
Now tell me who's inside that factory.

287
00:24:07,696 --> 00:24:10,031
I told you,
I don't know what you're talking about.

288
00:24:10,115 --> 00:24:12,242
I think it's time you find me a lawyer.

289
00:24:15,328 --> 00:24:16,788
Untie him.

290
00:24:18,123 --> 00:24:19,332
You heard him.

291
00:24:19,916 --> 00:24:21,001
Untie me.

292
00:24:29,676 --> 00:24:30,635
( Loomis grunts )

293
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:32,888
That's better.

294
00:24:33,847 --> 00:24:35,015
( groans )

295
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:41,229
( panting )

296
00:24:42,939 --> 00:24:45,567
I didn't feel right doing that
with you tied up.

297
00:24:46,526 --> 00:24:47,819
Carpenter Street.

298
00:24:48,862 --> 00:24:51,281
-You're not allowed to hit me.
-Untie him again.

299
00:24:51,364 --> 00:24:52,782
No, no, no, no!

300
00:24:52,866 --> 00:24:54,409
Wait a minute!
Wait a minute! Wait a minute!

301
00:24:54,492 --> 00:24:55,827
I don't know who he is, I swear to god.

302
00:24:55,911 --> 00:24:57,454
A doctor, maybe.

303
00:24:57,537 --> 00:24:59,247
Says he's working on a vaccine,
experimental.

304
00:24:59,331 --> 00:25:01,374
He says he doesn't have approval
or something like that.

305
00:25:01,458 --> 00:25:03,460
So he needed me to bring him people.

306
00:25:03,543 --> 00:25:06,421
Does it seem logical to you
that legitimate medical research

307
00:25:06,504 --> 00:25:08,673
is being conducted
in an abandoned factory?

308
00:25:09,216 --> 00:25:11,176
I thought about that.

309
00:25:11,259 --> 00:25:13,970
Just tonight I thought maybe
he's some kind of a terrorist.

310
00:25:14,054 --> 00:25:17,849
But I swear, if I knew that for a fact,
I never would have agreed to help him.

311
00:25:19,059 --> 00:25:23,188
In one individual, we've managed to find
the worst qualities of this era.

312
00:25:23,688 --> 00:25:28,443
Greed. Violence. Moral corruption.

313
00:25:28,526 --> 00:25:30,946
But he said
he wasn't going to hurt anybody.

314
00:25:31,571 --> 00:25:34,115
I just saw them an hour ago.
They were all OK.

315
00:25:34,449 --> 00:25:36,451
-How many?
-Five.

316
00:25:36,534 --> 00:25:37,953
No, no, six.

317
00:25:38,036 --> 00:25:39,955
The wheelchair guy was number six.

318
00:25:40,038 --> 00:25:41,998
How did this "doctor" find you?

319
00:25:42,082 --> 00:25:44,501
I told you I work at the blood bank.

320
00:25:44,584 --> 00:25:46,461
He wanted someone from every blood type.

321
00:25:46,544 --> 00:25:48,672
Eight blood types, eight people.

322
00:25:48,755 --> 00:25:51,591
He figured I had access
to that kind of information.

323
00:25:54,678 --> 00:25:56,554
Did he also figure

324
00:25:56,638 --> 00:26:00,517
that you'd have no compunctions
about abducting people?

325
00:26:01,851 --> 00:26:03,144
What's he paying you?

326
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:07,274
$5,000 apiece. Double for the last three.

327
00:26:07,357 --> 00:26:10,568
Is that what human life is worth
in the 21st century?

328
00:26:11,903 --> 00:26:14,906
I told you, he said he wasn't
going to hurt any of them.

329
00:26:15,615 --> 00:26:16,700
What does he look like?

330
00:26:17,826 --> 00:26:20,829
He only calls me on the phone.
I saw him a couple of times,

331
00:26:20,912 --> 00:26:22,789
but he stays in the shadows.

332
00:26:22,872 --> 00:26:25,542
You know, he's kind of tall.
That's all I can tell you.

333
00:26:26,209 --> 00:26:28,253
Why don't you let me go?

334
00:26:28,336 --> 00:26:30,547
I swear to you, I will never do it again.

335
00:26:31,298 --> 00:26:33,341
You are going to do it again.

336
00:26:34,217 --> 00:26:36,803
That is, if you have any hope
of staying out of prison.

337
00:26:36,886 --> 00:26:38,763
-What are you talking about?
-These two files...

338
00:26:38,847 --> 00:26:40,056
"AB" positive and "B" negative.

339
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:42,142
-They're the final two?
-Yeah.

340
00:26:42,225 --> 00:26:43,852
Well...

341
00:26:45,061 --> 00:26:47,063
Then you're looking at your next victim.

342
00:26:47,731 --> 00:26:49,816
A healthy male with "B" negative blood.

343
00:26:56,156 --> 00:26:58,533
If you think you're gonna
be in there a long time,

344
00:26:58,616 --> 00:27:00,994
-we should get something to eat first.
-Be quiet.

345
00:27:01,077 --> 00:27:03,872
Come on, I'm not...
I'm not talking about anything fancy.

346
00:27:03,955 --> 00:27:05,540
A burger?

347
00:27:05,623 --> 00:27:07,167
A taco?

348
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:11,296
There's a drive-through
less than a mile from here.

349
00:27:12,297 --> 00:27:14,174
Cops have to eat, don't they?

350
00:27:14,924 --> 00:27:17,052
What is the matter with you two? I'll pay.

351
00:27:17,135 --> 00:27:18,762
I told you to be quiet.

352
00:27:22,849 --> 00:27:24,809
What side of the street is it on?

353
00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:29,898
FEMALE: <i>Welcome to Burgerland.</i>
<i>How may I serve you today?</i>

354
00:27:29,981 --> 00:27:32,275
I'll have the double superbeef,
no lettuce.

355
00:27:34,277 --> 00:27:37,489
One double superbeef without lettuce,
please.

356
00:27:37,572 --> 00:27:39,991
FEMALE: <i>You can make that a triple</i>
<i>for only 40 cents extra.</i>

357
00:27:40,075 --> 00:27:41,368
Do it.

358
00:27:43,119 --> 00:27:45,038
A double will be fine.

359
00:27:45,121 --> 00:27:46,581
FEMALE: <i>Would you like </i>
<i>to make that a combo?</i>

360
00:27:46,664 --> 00:27:48,583
Yeah. Fries and a medium root beer.

361
00:27:48,666 --> 00:27:51,169
FEMALE: <i>Will there be anything else today?</i>

362
00:27:53,922 --> 00:27:56,007
A hamburger, ketchup only.

363
00:27:56,091 --> 00:27:58,968
FEMALE: <i>You can make that a double</i>
<i>for only 40 cents extra. </i>

364
00:27:59,052 --> 00:28:00,178
No, thank you.

365
00:28:00,261 --> 00:28:01,805
<i>Would you like to make that a combo?</i>

366
00:28:01,888 --> 00:28:03,723
No. No combo.

367
00:28:03,807 --> 00:28:05,975
FEMALE: <i>Will there be anything else today?</i>

368
00:28:09,646 --> 00:28:12,732
Does the fiesta salad
contain animal products?

369
00:28:12,816 --> 00:28:16,736
FEMALE: <i>No, but we can add three strips </i>
<i>of bacon for only 75 cents more.</i>

370
00:28:18,071 --> 00:28:19,739
Nothing for me, thank you.

371
00:28:19,823 --> 00:28:21,908
-ARCHER: You sure?
-Quite.

372
00:28:33,378 --> 00:28:36,214
You guys don't mind, do you? I'm starving.

373
00:28:37,298 --> 00:28:39,718
You know, it'd make it a lot easier
if you'd untie my hands.

374
00:28:39,801 --> 00:28:41,970
It's not like I'm going anywhere.

375
00:28:42,053 --> 00:28:43,471
Do the best you can.

376
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:48,768
Uh-oh. I told you.

377
00:28:50,186 --> 00:28:51,771
Let me get that for you.

378
00:28:51,855 --> 00:28:53,606
Oh, boy.

379
00:29:00,989 --> 00:29:02,741
You're a veggie. I forgot.

380
00:29:02,824 --> 00:29:05,034
Why don't you take a fry?
They're probably OK.

381
00:29:09,414 --> 00:29:10,957
Have it your way.

382
00:30:04,219 --> 00:30:07,430
( whispers ) They'll come in to take
fresh blood samples every hour.

383
00:30:08,348 --> 00:30:12,018
They readminister the sedative
every six hours.

384
00:30:12,685 --> 00:30:15,480
I recommend you do whatever
you're gonna do before then.

385
00:30:15,563 --> 00:30:16,564
( door opens )

386
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:22,028
Number seven.

387
00:30:22,111 --> 00:30:23,530
Which one is it?

388
00:30:24,322 --> 00:30:25,824
"B"... "B" negative.

389
00:30:25,907 --> 00:30:28,159
You'll have AB positive
by tomorrow night, I swear.

390
00:30:28,243 --> 00:30:29,911
Make certain I do.

391
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:54,477
Engage the engine and proceed
to the second location.

392
00:30:54,561 --> 00:30:56,062
Nice ray gun.

393
00:30:56,145 --> 00:30:58,273
Am I supposed to believe that thing's
for real?

394
00:31:00,859 --> 00:31:01,901
Drive.

395
00:31:09,742 --> 00:31:13,538
Ten grand apiece for the last three,
and I'm not gonna see a penny of it.

396
00:31:13,621 --> 00:31:16,499
Don't speak until
we're out of visual range.

397
00:31:21,421 --> 00:31:24,173
MALE XINDI:
15 milliliters from the new arrival.

398
00:31:54,412 --> 00:31:56,873
LOOMIS: You catch these guys
and I get immunity, right?

399
00:31:56,956 --> 00:31:59,000
We're not talking about
copping to a lesser charge.

400
00:31:59,083 --> 00:32:01,753
T'POL: When my associate returns,
we'll discuss the details.

401
00:32:01,836 --> 00:32:03,588
Hey, I'm taking a big chance here, OK?

402
00:32:03,671 --> 00:32:07,133
If your associate doesn't catch them,
they're gonna come looking for me, OK?

403
00:32:07,216 --> 00:32:09,093
You two better keep your word.

404
00:32:09,177 --> 00:32:12,931
You've been abducting people for money,
and you're questioning our honesty?

405
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:42,043
Sit back.

406
00:32:42,126 --> 00:32:44,545
Relax. I'm just getting a smoke.

407
00:32:47,924 --> 00:32:49,050
What are you doing?

408
00:32:50,426 --> 00:32:53,346
I don't know about you, honey,
but I'm a little tense, know what I mean?

409
00:32:53,429 --> 00:32:55,181
Extinguish that now.

410
00:32:55,264 --> 00:32:57,809
If you want some air, open your window.

411
00:32:59,602 --> 00:33:01,145
Now.

412
00:33:03,523 --> 00:33:05,066
( whirring )

413
00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:42,645
( communicator beeps )

414
00:33:43,646 --> 00:33:45,231
( keys jingling )

415
00:33:45,314 --> 00:33:47,233
Stay exactly where you are.

416
00:33:57,410 --> 00:33:58,578
T'Pol.

417
00:33:58,661 --> 00:34:00,580
ARCHER: <i>They brought </i>
<i>a bio-reactor with them.</i>

418
00:34:00,663 --> 00:34:02,665
<i>They're synthesizing </i>
<i>some kind of viral agent.</i>

419
00:34:02,749 --> 00:34:04,625
Rajiin warned us about a bio-weapon.

420
00:34:04,709 --> 00:34:06,044
This could be it.

421
00:34:06,127 --> 00:34:07,795
Why would they travel back through time?

422
00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:10,298
ARCHER: <i>Daniels said they might be </i>
<i>hiding from someone.</i>

423
00:34:10,381 --> 00:34:12,508
The past seems like
a pretty good place to hide.

424
00:34:12,842 --> 00:34:16,304
<i>We've got to keep them </i>
<i>from getting it back to our time.</i>

425
00:34:16,387 --> 00:34:18,931
Are you in a position
to disable all three of them?

426
00:34:19,015 --> 00:34:20,850
I don't know.

427
00:34:20,933 --> 00:34:22,685
I was thinking about trying
to take out the bio-reactor,

428
00:34:22,769 --> 00:34:25,104
but I could end up spreading
whatever's in there across half the city.

429
00:34:25,188 --> 00:34:27,440
They must have some kind of
temporal beacon.

430
00:34:27,523 --> 00:34:29,942
If you can destroy it,
they'll have no way of getting back.

431
00:34:30,026 --> 00:34:32,153
I've got to find it first.

432
00:34:32,236 --> 00:34:34,614
Modify your scanner
to a delta band frequency.

433
00:34:34,697 --> 00:34:36,157
That should...

434
00:35:15,696 --> 00:35:16,906
( yells )

435
00:35:50,106 --> 00:35:51,941
They've gone out the west door.

436
00:35:53,151 --> 00:35:54,485
They could be headed for the street.

437
00:35:56,737 --> 00:35:58,156
They have the virus.

438
00:36:08,708 --> 00:36:10,126
-T'Pol.
<i>-Yes, Captain.</i>

439
00:36:10,209 --> 00:36:11,878
They're in the west alleyway,
north of the main building.

440
00:36:11,961 --> 00:36:14,380
<i>-I could use some help.</i>
-Acknowledged.

441
00:36:17,842 --> 00:36:18,968
Drive.

442
00:36:19,677 --> 00:36:20,720
Trouble?

443
00:36:21,596 --> 00:36:22,722
Drive.

444
00:36:42,742 --> 00:36:45,161
Pull over and stop. Here.

445
00:36:48,539 --> 00:36:51,459
Give you all that fancy equipment,
and what good does it do you?

446
00:36:51,542 --> 00:36:52,585
Lower your window.

447
00:36:53,586 --> 00:36:55,546
I knew your partner's plan wouldn't work.

448
00:36:56,589 --> 00:36:57,757
Be quiet.

449
00:36:59,217 --> 00:37:00,301
They're coming.

450
00:37:09,018 --> 00:37:10,603
-( honking )
-Stop!

451
00:37:31,374 --> 00:37:32,917
( beeps )

452
00:37:38,506 --> 00:37:39,799
Come on.

453
00:38:06,117 --> 00:38:07,743
ARCHER: He's trying to release the toxin.

454
00:38:10,288 --> 00:38:13,749
We've eliminated his only means
of returning to his own century.

455
00:38:13,833 --> 00:38:15,459
Perhaps he has no other choice.

456
00:38:17,795 --> 00:38:19,255
ARCHER: If he's trying
to destroy humanity,

457
00:38:19,338 --> 00:38:21,007
he's not gonna be able to do it with that.

458
00:38:21,090 --> 00:38:23,426
They only modified the virus
for six blood types.

459
00:38:23,509 --> 00:38:26,887
If they can infect
three-quarters of Earth's population,

460
00:38:26,971 --> 00:38:29,432
it's unlikely humans would pose
a threat to them in the future.

461
00:38:31,559 --> 00:38:33,352
Let's hope he can't see in the dark.

462
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:36,022
Keep laying down fire.

463
00:38:41,235 --> 00:38:43,446
( guns firing )

464
00:39:23,319 --> 00:39:25,696
-Don't move a muscle.
-( hisses )

465
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:27,490
Drop it.

466
00:39:32,912 --> 00:39:34,288
Why a second weapon?

467
00:39:35,873 --> 00:39:37,792
Where were you going to take it?

468
00:39:38,334 --> 00:39:42,213
We won't allow you to destroy us.

469
00:39:43,381 --> 00:39:45,966
Your species is doomed.

470
00:40:12,159 --> 00:40:13,202
Let's go.

471
00:40:19,458 --> 00:40:20,501
Problem, sir?

472
00:40:22,878 --> 00:40:24,338
It's done.

473
00:40:24,422 --> 00:40:25,673
Sir?

474
00:40:26,298 --> 00:40:28,300
-Archer to Lieutenant Reed.
-MALCOLM: <i>Go ahead.</i>

475
00:40:28,384 --> 00:40:30,386
Get a team down
to the command center on the double.

476
00:40:30,469 --> 00:40:31,470
<i>Aye, sir.</i>

477
00:40:31,554 --> 00:40:33,013
Wait here for Malcolm.

478
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:34,598
Have everything brought to cargo bay 2.

479
00:40:34,682 --> 00:40:37,184
I've got to get this to Phlox.

480
00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:39,854
-What's going on?
-Come with me.

481
00:41:00,916 --> 00:41:02,877
( sirens wailing )

482
00:41:07,089 --> 00:41:09,758
-Get out of the car!
-He's on something.

483
00:41:09,842 --> 00:41:11,802
Get out of the car!
Keep your hands where we can see them.

484
00:41:11,886 --> 00:41:13,262
Come on. Come on.

485
00:41:13,345 --> 00:41:14,638
What's going on?

486
00:41:15,806 --> 00:41:17,766
Hey, hey, hey, hey. I didn't do anything.

487
00:41:17,850 --> 00:41:19,310
OFFICER: We got a tip says you did.

488
00:41:19,393 --> 00:41:21,395
You're just lucky
all six of them are still alive.

489
00:41:21,479 --> 00:41:24,398
Those two cops that came to my place,
they offered me a deal.

490
00:41:24,482 --> 00:41:25,900
That's the only reason I helped them.

491
00:41:25,983 --> 00:41:27,401
I don't know what you're talking about.

492
00:41:27,485 --> 00:41:28,819
Get him out of here.

493
00:41:28,903 --> 00:41:31,572
Those creatures... The lizard people...

494
00:41:31,655 --> 00:41:33,949
They're around here somewhere.
You got to find them.

495
00:41:34,033 --> 00:41:35,618
No problem. We'll get right on that.

496
00:41:35,701 --> 00:41:37,912
Be careful. Be careful. They got ray guns.

497
00:41:37,995 --> 00:41:40,164
Yeah, ray guns. Got it. Watch your head.
