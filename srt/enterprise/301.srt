YOU HEARD ME, TRAVIS.

685
00:41:08,258 --> 00:41:11,594
THEY SCANNED THE DEBRIS AND LEFT
NEARLY THREE HOURS AGO.

686
00:41:11,594 --> 00:41:12,929
THEIR HEADING?

687
00:41:12,929 --> 00:41:15,640
TOWARD THE ORASSIN
DISTORTION FIELDS.

688
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:18,393
THEN IT'S UNLIKELY
THEY'LL SURVIVE.

689
00:41:22,730 --> 00:41:25,900
IF THEY ARE
THE FIRST WAVE OF AN INVASION,

690
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:29,112
IT WOULD BE BEST
FOR US TO REMAIN HIDDEN.

691
00:41:29,112 --> 00:41:30,822
LET THEM KEEP SEARCHING.
