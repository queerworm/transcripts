{\an8}Please.

58
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:14,003
{\an8}You programmed a PADD to unlock
every security door in the building.

59
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:16,673
{\an8}I was particularly proud of that.

60
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:19,133
{\an8}I made it all the way to Sausalito.

61
00:04:20,385 --> 00:04:23,012
{\an8}On the rare occasion
I get stuck on a problem,

62
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:27,767
{\an8}I find a vigorous escape attempt
helps to clear the head.

63
00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:32,480
{\an8}Go ahead.

64
00:04:34,065 --> 00:04:35,942
{\an8}They're DNA sequences.

65
00:04:36,859 --> 00:04:40,405
{\an8}That one's for a modification
of the human T-cell.

66
00:04:40,488 --> 00:04:43,866
{\an8}It would render Sharat Syndrome
a thing of the past.

67
00:04:44,742 --> 00:04:46,286
That one...

68
00:04:46,369 --> 00:04:49,998
Increases the visual spectrum by 5%.

69
00:04:50,081 --> 00:04:52,792
Of course,
none of this will ever be tested.

70
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:55,295
{\an8}They clear out my room every few months.

71
00:04:55,378 --> 00:04:59,257
{\an8}I'm told it all gets-- Poof-- Vaporized.

72
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:02,969
{\an8}Why invest so much time and energy
on things no one will ever use?

73
00:05:03,052 --> 00:05:08,766
{\an8}How can a supposedly intelligent species
reject technology

74
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:12,145
{\an8}that would enhance ability,
relieve suffering?

75
00:05:13,771 --> 00:05:17,900
{\an8}Genetic engineering has caused
a lot of suffering.

76
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:19,610
So did splitting the atom,

77
00:05:19,694 --> 00:05:22,280
yet the first ships
to colonize the solar system

78
00:05:22,363 --> 00:05:23,614
were nuclear-powered.

79
00:05:23,698 --> 00:05:26,951
But you're not here to discuss that.

80
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:30,705
Someone attacked a Klingon bird-of-prey.

81
00:05:30,788 --> 00:05:32,957
The entire crew was massacred.
The ship is missing.

82
00:05:33,624 --> 00:05:35,960
I read the reports.

83
00:05:36,044 --> 00:05:38,921
I understand the Klingons
are quite annoyed.

84
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:41,299
Looks like you might have
saved Earth for nothing.

85
00:05:41,382 --> 00:05:45,511
Whoever's responsible
jettisoned the Klingon crew into space.

86
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:48,097
DNA was recovered from the bodies.

87
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:50,767
Let me guess... human.

88
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:52,268
Not quite.

89
00:05:56,481 --> 00:05:57,690
I see.

90
00:05:57,774 --> 00:06:00,109
They were Augments.

91
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:03,571
Their genetically-enhanced DNA
matched embryos

92
00:06:03,654 --> 00:06:07,200
stolen from a medical facility
over 20 years ago.

93
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:09,535
Stolen by you.

94
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:20,421
Soong used to work at Cold Station 12,

95
00:06:20,505 --> 00:06:23,091
a top-secret medical research station.

96
00:06:23,174 --> 00:06:26,594
Isn't that where Starfleet
keeps a stockpile of infectious diseases?

97
00:06:26,677 --> 00:06:32,558
Along with genetically engineered embryos
left over from the Eugenics Wars.

98
00:06:32,642 --> 00:06:35,478
It's been kept from the public
for obvious reasons.

99
00:06:35,561 --> 00:06:37,396
I remember Soong's trial.

100
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:40,483
He wouldn't say what he did
with the embryos he stole.

101
00:06:40,566 --> 00:06:42,819
Now he claims that
he took them to a planet

102
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:46,030
in the Trialas system and raised them.

103
00:06:46,114 --> 00:06:49,117
They were around 10 years old
when he was captured...

104
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,952
A decade ago.

105
00:06:51,035 --> 00:06:53,121
So there could be a bunch of Augments
from the Eugenics Wars

106
00:06:53,204 --> 00:06:54,247
running around loose.

107
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:56,165
Not a pretty thought.

108
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:58,459
What would they want
with a Klingon bird-of-prey?

109
00:06:58,543 --> 00:07:01,420
We don't know. Neither does Soong.

110
00:07:01,504 --> 00:07:04,090
At least, he claims he doesn't.

111
00:07:04,173 --> 00:07:08,511
But he does think he can convince them
to surrender without a fight.

112
00:07:08,594 --> 00:07:10,721
You're bringing him along.

113
00:07:10,805 --> 00:07:13,724
There's also the fact that
he spent time in the Borderland.

114
00:07:13,808 --> 00:07:15,560
The Borderland?

115
00:07:15,643 --> 00:07:18,146
It's the area where
the Klingon ship was attacked.

116
00:07:18,229 --> 00:07:20,940
It's a volatile region
between the Klingon empire

117
00:07:21,023 --> 00:07:23,276
and the Orion Syndicate.

118
00:07:23,359 --> 00:07:26,279
It attracts the most dangerous
elements from both.

119
00:07:26,362 --> 00:07:27,822
Sorry I asked.

120
00:07:27,905 --> 00:07:31,325
The Klingons have threatened to retaliate
with everything they've got.

121
00:07:31,409 --> 00:07:35,329
We're the fastest ship
and the most experienced crew.

122
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:39,417
We have to find the Augments
and bring them back.

123
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:43,713
It's the only way to avert a war.

124
00:07:45,756 --> 00:07:47,383
We launch in six hours.

125
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:53,973
We've mastered their engine controls.

126
00:07:54,056 --> 00:07:57,268
Wing-mounted disruptor cannons,
photon torpedo launchers.

127
00:07:57,351 --> 00:07:59,395
This ship's an arsenal.

128
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:01,397
We're finally free.

129
00:08:08,696 --> 00:08:10,072
A fine ship.

130
00:08:13,075 --> 00:08:14,994
( grunts )

131
00:08:21,709 --> 00:08:23,419
I thought you'd be pleased.

132
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:25,421
I didn't sanction this attack.

133
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:27,757
If you'd failed,
they would have come after all of us.

134
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,050
I didn't fail.

135
00:08:29,133 --> 00:08:30,676
Their government knows what we did.

136
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,678
They have ships hunting for us right now.

137
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:34,680
They won't find us.

138
00:08:40,102 --> 00:08:43,189
It was time for us to leave
this godforsaken planet.

139
00:08:43,272 --> 00:08:45,691
That was my decision, not yours!

140
00:08:47,109 --> 00:08:49,695
Have you forgotten who I am?

141
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:50,905
Have you?

142
00:08:53,115 --> 00:08:54,867
No, Raakin.

143
00:08:54,951 --> 00:08:56,202
Say it.

144
00:08:57,745 --> 00:08:59,413
You're our leader.

145
00:09:05,127 --> 00:09:08,214
Don't ever make me ask you again.

146
00:09:08,297 --> 00:09:10,925
Notify me when the rest
of our supplies are on board.

147
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:13,094
We're leaving orbit.

148
00:09:26,315 --> 00:09:28,317
Permission to come aboard, sir?

149
00:09:30,695 --> 00:09:32,572
This is my science officer, T'Pol.

150
00:09:32,655 --> 00:09:34,115
No need for an introduction.

151
00:09:34,198 --> 00:09:37,034
I admire your people very much.

152
00:09:37,118 --> 00:09:39,078
We share a similar view of humanity.

153
00:09:39,161 --> 00:09:40,413
What view is that?

154
00:09:40,496 --> 00:09:42,540
That it could stand some improvement.

155
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:46,711
I believe that's true of most species,
if not all.

156
00:09:46,794 --> 00:09:47,962
( chuckles )

157
00:09:48,045 --> 00:09:50,131
My tactical officer, Lieutenant Reed.

158
00:09:50,214 --> 00:09:51,257
Doctor.

159
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:54,343
I've heard of you,
but I don't recognize your face.

160
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:56,887
You're not getting
your fair share of publicity.

161
00:09:57,471 --> 00:09:59,181
I think I've had all I can stand.

162
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:01,726
We've prepared some quarters.

163
00:10:01,809 --> 00:10:04,520
You'll be under guard at all times.

164
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:06,981
If you should decide
you need to "clear your head."

165
00:10:07,064 --> 00:10:08,232
( scoffs )

166
00:10:08,316 --> 00:10:10,735
We're on a starship
soon to be at high warp.

167
00:10:10,818 --> 00:10:12,737
Where exactly would I go?

168
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:14,739
It's this way.

169
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:19,452
If I could examine the DNA samples
the Klingons recovered,

170
00:10:19,535 --> 00:10:22,580
I could tell you something
about the current state of the Augments.

171
00:10:22,663 --> 00:10:25,082
I'll have the information
sent to your quarters.

172
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:28,377
A laboratory would be preferable,
your sickbay.

173
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:31,213
Dr. Phlox's reputation rivals my own...

174
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:32,923
Before I was imprisoned, of course.

175
00:10:33,007 --> 00:10:34,550
I'd enjoy trading notes with him.

176
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:36,302
I'll consider it.

177
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:39,138

00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:46,979
So, how was the honeymoon?

179
00:10:47,063 --> 00:10:49,148
Honeymoon?

180
00:10:49,231 --> 00:10:51,942
You were on Vulcan another
two weeks after I left. I figured...

181
00:10:52,026 --> 00:10:53,569
( door opens )

182
00:10:56,405 --> 00:10:57,907
( sighs )

183
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:00,660
It comes with everything
but its own protein resequencer.

184
00:11:00,743 --> 00:11:03,287
For that, I'll need another day.

185
00:11:10,086 --> 00:11:11,504
( sighs )

186
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:18,260
I like it.

187
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:20,304
We don't have time
to go over all the details.

188
00:11:20,388 --> 00:11:22,681
Just, uh, try not to hit that button.

189
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:25,351
We're cleared for launch.

190
00:11:32,733 --> 00:11:34,110
Here we are again.

191
00:11:41,659 --> 00:11:43,369
Wouldn't have it any other way.

192
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:51,127
Travis.

193
00:11:55,673 --> 00:11:57,800
( energy humming )

194
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:27,371
I just received an intelligence report.

195
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:30,666
A Klingon warship was spotted
near Proxima Colony.

196
00:12:30,749 --> 00:12:32,251
Admiral Forrest thinks they could be

197
00:12:32,334 --> 00:12:35,671
conducting reconnaissance
for a future strike.

198
00:12:36,088 --> 00:12:37,673
I wanted to keep you up to date.

199
00:12:38,215 --> 00:12:41,469
My government is trying
to work out a diplomatic solution.

200
00:12:41,552 --> 00:12:43,846
There's still a chance
they'll be successful.

201
00:12:44,472 --> 00:12:45,806
Small chance.

202
00:12:47,516 --> 00:12:48,809
One other thing.

203
00:12:53,689 --> 00:12:57,776
It's your first official day of duty,
Commander T'Pol.

204
00:13:00,196 --> 00:13:01,238
A present.

205
00:13:06,577 --> 00:13:08,496
It's from the early 20th century.

206
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:14,752
Should help keep you pointed
in the right direction.

207
00:13:17,171 --> 00:13:18,881
I'm glad you're with us.

208
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:25,054
Thank you, Captain.

209
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:31,977
ARCHER: <i>Captain's starlog, May 17, 2154.</i>

210
00:13:32,061 --> 00:13:33,979
<i>We've crossed into the Borderland,</i>

211
00:13:34,063 --> 00:13:37,233
<i>three light-years from where</i>
<i>the Klingons were attacked.</i>

212
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:39,527
<i>Still no sign of their ship.</i>

213
00:13:40,277 --> 00:13:43,030
Malik. ( laughing )

214
00:13:43,989 --> 00:13:44,990
( sighs )

215
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:47,826
He was the rebellious one.

216
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:50,663
Reminded me of myself when I was his age.

217
00:13:53,207 --> 00:13:56,502
I came to think of them
as my own children.

218
00:13:56,585 --> 00:14:00,631
Must have been difficult
for you to leave them behind.

219
00:14:00,714 --> 00:14:02,883
I knew they'd survive.

220
00:14:05,177 --> 00:14:08,806
This is extremely sophisticated
work for 20th-century Earth.

221
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:12,935
Well, I made some modifications of my own.

222
00:14:13,018 --> 00:14:15,646
Oh, really? What kind of modifications?

223
00:14:16,021 --> 00:14:17,273
Um...

224
00:14:17,856 --> 00:14:20,192
I prefer to let my work speak for itself.

225
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:22,987
I think it already has.

226
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:27,741
I didn't realize you shared humanity's

227
00:14:27,825 --> 00:14:31,537
reactionary attitude
toward this field of medicine.

228
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:34,415
On the contrary.

229
00:14:34,498 --> 00:14:36,584
We've used genetic engineering on Denobula

230
00:14:36,667 --> 00:14:39,211
for over two centuries,
to generally positive effect.

231
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:41,463
But you don't approve of what I've done.

232
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:44,008
You tried to redesign your species.

233
00:14:44,091 --> 00:14:45,634
The first time
that was attempted on Earth,

234
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:48,304
the result was 30 million deaths.

235
00:14:48,387 --> 00:14:51,724
We can't let past mistakes hold us back.

236
00:14:51,807 --> 00:14:55,978
It's your responsibility as a scientist
to learn from past mistakes.

237
00:14:56,061 --> 00:14:58,397
Well, what makes you think I haven't?

238
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,232
I can read.

239
00:15:07,031 --> 00:15:08,282
( rumbling )

240
00:15:08,365 --> 00:15:09,825
Two vessels are coming up behind us.

241
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:11,744
Orion interceptors.

242
00:15:11,827 --> 00:15:15,789
Interesting way of saying hello. Hoshi?

243
00:15:15,873 --> 00:15:16,874
No response.

244
00:15:16,957 --> 00:15:18,083
( rumbling )

245
00:15:33,724 --> 00:15:36,226
We're getting hammered down here!

246
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:38,270
Keep firing.

247
00:15:38,354 --> 00:15:40,189
( beeping )

248
00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:42,733
I'm picking up an energy surge
from one of the interceptors.

249
00:15:42,816 --> 00:15:44,860
-A weapon?
-No.

250
00:15:51,158 --> 00:15:52,576
Tucker to the bridge.

251
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:54,370
Two of my people just disappeared.

252
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:56,830
The interceptors have jumped to warp.

253
00:15:58,999 --> 00:16:00,584
They're gone.

254
00:16:01,835 --> 00:16:04,421
They took nine people, including T'Pol.

255
00:16:04,505 --> 00:16:05,923
Hmm...

256
00:16:06,006 --> 00:16:08,926
There never used to be
Orions in this area.

257
00:16:09,009 --> 00:16:12,096
They must have expanded
their range of operations.

258
00:16:12,179 --> 00:16:13,514
( clicks tongue )

259
00:16:13,597 --> 00:16:15,057
It's a shame.

260
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:17,142
I really liked your science officer.

261
00:16:17,226 --> 00:16:18,519
How do I get them back?

262
00:16:18,602 --> 00:16:20,771
( sighs ) It's not going to be easy.

263
00:16:20,854 --> 00:16:22,523
That's not what I asked you.

264
00:16:23,232 --> 00:16:26,318
They've most likely been taken
to a processing station.

265
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:28,278
The nearest one's on Verex III.

266
00:16:28,362 --> 00:16:29,405
( communicator beeps )

267
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:31,198
-Archer to bridge.
<i>-Reed.</i>

268
00:16:31,281 --> 00:16:33,867
Set a course for Verex III,
best possible speed.

269
00:16:33,951 --> 00:16:36,161
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

270
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:37,830
What'll happen to them there?

271
00:16:37,913 --> 00:16:40,249
They'll be ushered
into their new profession...

272
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:41,458
As slaves.

273
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:44,712
These stations are heavily guarded.

274
00:16:44,795 --> 00:16:47,423
Only legitimate traders
are permitted to enter.

275
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:49,508
I have the feeling you found your way in.

276
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:53,303
I had to establish
a relationship with the Orions.

277
00:16:53,387 --> 00:16:56,598
They helped me acquire
certain goods and equipment

278
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:59,476
I needed to survive.

279
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:04,773
I can get you inside,
but I can't get your people out.

280
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:06,734
One step at a time.

281
00:17:16,243 --> 00:17:22,082
Raakin is taking us to another system
where we can live out our lives in peace.

282
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:26,503
But I'm sure he's already told you that.

283
00:17:26,587 --> 00:17:28,464
He doesn't tell me everything.

284
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:30,924
This isn't what our father
would have wanted.

285
00:17:31,008 --> 00:17:33,552
He didn't raise us to run away and hide.

286
00:17:33,635 --> 00:17:36,180
Well, what do you propose?

287
00:17:36,263 --> 00:17:39,850
You could try
to convince Raakin to reconsider.

288
00:17:39,933 --> 00:17:43,687
He only wants one thing from me,
and it isn't advice.

289
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:47,649
It doesn't suit you.

290
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:49,193
What?

291
00:17:49,276 --> 00:17:50,861
Playing the victim.

292
00:17:58,327 --> 00:18:00,412
You chose Raakin.

293
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:02,873
You wanted the strongest for yourself.

294
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:06,418
I still do.

295
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:08,003
( sighs )

296
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:10,255
What is it you want?

297
00:18:13,634 --> 00:18:14,718
( gasps )

298
00:18:16,386 --> 00:18:18,847
There's plenty of time for that.

299
00:18:24,144 --> 00:18:27,022
-( electronic humming )
-( groaning )

300
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:30,150
You are now the property
of the Orion syndicate.

301
00:18:30,234 --> 00:18:32,945
Break the rules and you will suffer.

302
00:18:33,028 --> 00:18:35,531
Follow the rules and you will suffer less.

303
00:18:35,614 --> 00:18:36,865
Take her.

304
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:40,035
( indistinct shouting )

305
00:18:56,426 --> 00:18:58,887
-Ensign.
-Commander!

306
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:00,347
Are you all right?

307
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:02,224
This thing, it hurts.

308
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:04,101
Don't touch it.

309
00:19:04,184 --> 00:19:05,769
Have you seen anyone else from the ship?

310
00:19:05,853 --> 00:19:07,312
-Just you.
-( man screaming )

311
00:19:07,396 --> 00:19:10,232
-Where are we?
-An Orion slave market.

312
00:19:10,315 --> 00:19:11,733
Slave market?

313
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:14,611
The Orions traffic in forced labor.

314
00:19:14,695 --> 00:19:16,780
We're being processed for auction.

315
00:19:16,864 --> 00:19:18,282
This can't be happening.

316
00:19:18,365 --> 00:19:20,742
They're gonna come for us, right?
The ship?

317
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:21,743
Ensign--

318
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:23,036
The Captain's gonna get us out of here!

319
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,329
Ensign!

320
00:19:26,707 --> 00:19:28,125
I don't know your name.

321
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:31,170
Pierce. Jeffrey Pierce. I just signed on.

322
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:33,463
Jeffrey...

323
00:19:33,547 --> 00:19:36,508
<i>Enterprise </i>will come.

324
00:19:36,592 --> 00:19:39,178
It may take some time.

325
00:19:39,261 --> 00:19:42,139
We should try to stay together
until they get here.

326
00:19:42,222 --> 00:19:43,807
( sobs )

327
00:19:49,646 --> 00:19:51,565
MALE: <i>Transmit your identification code.</i>

328
00:19:51,648 --> 00:19:53,901
( beeping )

329
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:57,404
Soong hasn't used this code in years.

330
00:19:57,988 --> 00:20:00,115
Give it time.

331
00:20:02,242 --> 00:20:03,994
MALE: <i>You're cleared to proceed.</i>

332
00:20:07,289 --> 00:20:08,707
ARCHER: Phlox.

333
00:20:10,626 --> 00:20:13,712
Transponder.
It has a range of 10 kilometers.

334
00:20:13,795 --> 00:20:17,257
You wander off more than a step or two,
we bring you right back here.

335
00:20:19,009 --> 00:20:22,471
You don't like me, do you,
Commander Tucker?

336
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:24,056
No, I don't.

337
00:20:24,139 --> 00:20:28,602
You probably blame me for
what happened to your Vulcan... friend.

338
00:20:29,186 --> 00:20:30,979
That's enough.

339
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:33,607
Your crew could use a sense of humor.

340
00:20:34,858 --> 00:20:36,610
Make the engines a priority.

341
00:20:36,693 --> 00:20:39,905
When it's time to leave, I have a feeling
we're gonna need all the speed we can get.

342
00:20:41,573 --> 00:20:43,492
( transporter humming )

343
00:20:43,575 --> 00:20:46,411
I read every transcript of every mission.

344
00:20:46,495 --> 00:20:49,081
I thought I was prepared,
that I knew what to expect.

345
00:20:49,164 --> 00:20:50,123
( metal clanks )

346
00:20:50,207 --> 00:20:52,501
-( prisoners clamoring )
-Boy, was I wrong.

347
00:20:52,584 --> 00:20:55,545
If you wish, I can teach you
how to minimize your anxiety.

348
00:20:55,629 --> 00:20:58,173
Yeah, I'd like that.

349
00:20:58,257 --> 00:21:00,217
( sniffs ) I'd like that a lot.

350
00:21:04,221 --> 00:21:06,807
-Leave her alone!
-( exclaims )

351
00:21:07,641 --> 00:21:08,934
-Ensign, don't!

352
00:21:09,017 --> 00:21:10,644
( screaming )

353
00:21:12,145 --> 00:21:14,273
( loud beeping )

354
00:21:17,901 --> 00:21:19,528
( laughing )

355
00:21:19,611 --> 00:21:21,822
( beeping )

356
00:21:27,202 --> 00:21:28,745
( laughing )

357
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,425
You're doing well.

358
00:21:47,723 --> 00:21:49,349
( beeping )

359
00:21:52,853 --> 00:21:54,104
( laughs )

360
00:21:54,187 --> 00:21:55,897
( laughs )

361
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:57,983
Three million six!

362
00:21:58,066 --> 00:22:01,194
Not even my last wife sold for that much.

363
00:22:01,278 --> 00:22:03,155
( laughing )

364
00:22:07,117 --> 00:22:08,368
MALE: Stand up!

365
00:22:10,787 --> 00:22:12,539
Bring that woman.

366
00:22:15,709 --> 00:22:17,336
Over here.

367
00:22:19,671 --> 00:22:21,173
You, come with me.

368
00:22:26,762 --> 00:22:29,056
At least we know four
of your people are still here.

369
00:22:29,139 --> 00:22:31,933
Doesn't seem to be
much demand for humans.

370
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:34,102
ARCHER: Those devices on their necks...

371
00:22:34,186 --> 00:22:37,606
Neurolytic restraints. Ingenious, really.

372
00:22:37,689 --> 00:22:41,526
They induce convulsive seizures
in disobedient slaves.

373
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:44,237
If a slave attempts
to leave the premises...

374
00:22:45,864 --> 00:22:47,532
So if you try to beam them out...

375
00:22:47,616 --> 00:22:49,785
Wouldn't recommend it,
not if you want them alive.

376
00:22:49,868 --> 00:22:51,244
( beeping )

377
00:22:57,501 --> 00:23:00,003
( loud beeping )

378
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:05,300
( beeping )

379
00:23:05,383 --> 00:23:07,010
( buzzing )

380
00:23:19,439 --> 00:23:20,899
They sell their own people?

381
00:23:20,982 --> 00:23:23,443
Only the women.

382
00:23:23,527 --> 00:23:27,072
Orion females are known
for their extreme appetites,

383
00:23:27,155 --> 00:23:29,658
their innate skills.

384
00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:32,786
Come on.

385
00:23:32,869 --> 00:23:34,329
( buzzing )

386
00:23:34,412 --> 00:23:36,623
( indistinct conversations )

387
00:23:36,706 --> 00:23:37,999
( beeping )

388
00:23:44,339 --> 00:23:45,841
T'Pol.

389
00:23:48,385 --> 00:23:49,469
You all right?

390
00:23:49,845 --> 00:23:51,138
How many were taken?

391
00:23:51,221 --> 00:23:53,306
Nine. We've located five so far.

392
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:55,058
We're working on a way to try and--

393
00:23:55,642 --> 00:23:59,771
She's sold. Buyers are over there.

394
00:23:59,855 --> 00:24:02,691
Uh, we-- we-- we made a wrong turn.

395
00:24:02,774 --> 00:24:03,817
( chuckling )

396
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:05,819
Thank you so much, though.
Thank you for your help.

397
00:24:05,902 --> 00:24:08,864
Really. Thank you. Let's go.

398
00:24:15,078 --> 00:24:19,082
He argues with every command I give,
defies me in front of the others.

399
00:24:19,166 --> 00:24:22,085
Some of them agree with what he did,
taking this ship.

400
00:24:22,169 --> 00:24:23,795
They've forgotten how we've
stayed alive all these years.

401
00:24:23,879 --> 00:24:27,382
My resolve was what kept us
from starving to death on that rock.

402
00:24:27,465 --> 00:24:31,011
They believe it's Malik
who liberated us from that rock.

403
00:24:32,137 --> 00:24:34,139
You agree with them.

404
00:24:34,222 --> 00:24:36,183
How can you say that?

405
00:24:36,266 --> 00:24:38,185
I hear it in your voice.

406
00:24:40,228 --> 00:24:43,356
Malik's doing more than arguing
with your commands.

407
00:24:44,733 --> 00:24:46,651
He's plotting against you.

408
00:24:47,444 --> 00:24:49,738
He wants to take your place.

409
00:24:50,322 --> 00:24:52,657
How do you know that?

410
00:24:54,117 --> 00:24:56,036
He told me.

411
00:24:56,953 --> 00:24:59,080
Malik's always wanted me.

412
00:24:59,623 --> 00:25:04,544
I knew he was planning something,
so I let him think I wanted him as well.

413
00:25:06,463 --> 00:25:08,757
He said that you're weak,

414
00:25:10,508 --> 00:25:12,886
that you're making all of us weak,

415
00:25:14,137 --> 00:25:16,723
that you're betraying Father's principles,

416
00:25:16,806 --> 00:25:19,226
that if Father were here,

417
00:25:19,309 --> 00:25:21,978
he'd choose Malik to lead us.

418
00:25:23,355 --> 00:25:26,608
I will betray Father's principles.

419
00:25:29,027 --> 00:25:31,780
I'm going to kill my own brother.

420
00:25:38,912 --> 00:25:40,997
( loud beeping )

421
00:25:46,211 --> 00:25:51,216
If you don't sell as a slave,
I will sell you as food.

422
00:25:58,598 --> 00:26:00,183
( buzzing )

423
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:11,987
( beeping )

424
00:26:13,822 --> 00:26:18,118
( groans ) That's barely enough
to cover the expense of processing you.

425
00:26:19,744 --> 00:26:21,037
Archer to <i>Enterprise.</i>

426
00:26:21,121 --> 00:26:22,539
<i>Tucker here.</i>

427
00:26:22,622 --> 00:26:24,541
We've located everyone, including T'Pol.

428
00:26:24,624 --> 00:26:27,377
I'm gonna need six kilos
of tritanium cobalt.

429
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:29,296
-Nine.
<i>-Make that nine.</i>

430
00:26:29,379 --> 00:26:30,755
That's half our supply.

431
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:32,799
I'll explain later. Just get it ready.

432
00:26:32,882 --> 00:26:34,050
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

433
00:26:37,637 --> 00:26:40,974
ARCHER: They normally remove
the restraint after a sale.

434
00:26:41,057 --> 00:26:43,518
We used the extra tritanium
to bribe one of the guards

435
00:26:43,601 --> 00:26:45,520
to deactivate it but leave it on.

436
00:26:45,603 --> 00:26:47,355
Why can't we just buy
the rest of our people?

437
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:48,940
T'Pol's already been sold.

438
00:26:49,024 --> 00:26:51,067
We don't have time
to try and buy them all.

439
00:26:51,151 --> 00:26:52,902
We're almost there. Try to hold still.

440
00:26:52,986 --> 00:26:54,738
What kind of people are these?

441
00:26:54,821 --> 00:26:57,532
I'd say they're not unlike
some of your ancestors,

442
00:26:57,615 --> 00:26:58,908
judging from your accent.

443
00:26:58,992 --> 00:27:00,618
If I remember my history,

444
00:27:00,702 --> 00:27:03,038
these Augments you love so much
had plenty of slaves.

445
00:27:03,121 --> 00:27:05,540
( chuckles ) They were more like subjects.

446
00:27:05,623 --> 00:27:08,501
Oh. They were just treated like slaves.

447
00:27:09,502 --> 00:27:11,713
( groaning )

448
00:27:11,796 --> 00:27:14,424
T'Pol could be shipped out any second.

449
00:27:14,507 --> 00:27:15,925
Work fast.

450
00:27:17,802 --> 00:27:20,555
I told him everything.

451
00:27:20,638 --> 00:27:23,099
He thinks
you're planning an attack against him.

452
00:27:23,183 --> 00:27:24,601
Is he going to move against me?

453
00:27:24,684 --> 00:27:25,935
See for yourself.

454
00:27:27,604 --> 00:27:29,272
Is this the move you expected?

455
00:27:30,982 --> 00:27:32,442
It's between us.

456
00:27:33,526 --> 00:27:36,404
I saved your life once
when we were children,

457
00:27:36,488 --> 00:27:38,406
pulled you from the river
when you fell in.

458
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:39,783
I remember.

459
00:27:39,866 --> 00:27:42,577
Now, 10 years later,
you're plotting against me.

460
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:45,622
I'm the strongest... and the smartest.

461
00:27:45,705 --> 00:27:48,416
Doesn't look that way from here.

462
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:51,378
You would never have trapped me like this.

463
00:27:51,461 --> 00:27:52,962
( gun clicks )

464
00:27:53,046 --> 00:27:54,506
But I have.

465
00:27:58,885 --> 00:28:00,470
I'm sorry, Raakin.

466
00:28:00,553 --> 00:28:02,430
( grunts )

467
00:28:03,348 --> 00:28:05,475
It's between us.

468
00:28:05,558 --> 00:28:06,810
Saul...

469
00:28:08,853 --> 00:28:11,106
Jaya, listen to me.

470
00:28:11,189 --> 00:28:14,025
They only listen to me now.

471
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:33,294
There was a time when I looked up to you,

472
00:28:35,296 --> 00:28:37,549
when I called you my brother.

473
00:28:38,341 --> 00:28:40,093
I am your brother.

474
00:28:40,176 --> 00:28:45,306
When you rejected our father's wishes,
you stopped being one of us.

475
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:48,601
And when that happened...

476
00:28:48,685 --> 00:28:50,854
You ceased to exist.

477
00:28:52,147 --> 00:28:54,232
-( blade plunges )
-( gasps )

478
00:28:54,315 --> 00:28:56,401
( groans )

479
00:28:58,069 --> 00:29:00,488
Which makes this an act of mercy.

480
00:29:04,659 --> 00:29:06,035
Get rid of him.

481
00:29:12,792 --> 00:29:13,877
Don't.

482
00:29:16,504 --> 00:29:18,131
Not for him.

483
00:29:21,092 --> 00:29:22,927
TUCKER: <i>We're sending the code now.</i>

484
00:29:23,011 --> 00:29:24,429
( beeps )

485
00:29:24,512 --> 00:29:25,764
Got it.

486
00:29:37,442 --> 00:29:38,485
( hypospray hisses )

487
00:29:38,568 --> 00:29:40,069
( gasping )

488
00:29:58,880 --> 00:29:59,964
( beeping )

489
00:30:04,093 --> 00:30:06,095
( indistinct conversations )

490
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:11,810
Outside.

491
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:16,564
Outside.

492
00:30:24,072 --> 00:30:27,033
( speaking indistinctly )

493
00:30:27,116 --> 00:30:29,118
( beeping )

494
00:30:29,202 --> 00:30:30,703
( device deactivates )

495
00:30:34,457 --> 00:30:36,209
( grunts )

496
00:30:36,292 --> 00:30:37,335
( beeping )

497
00:30:37,418 --> 00:30:40,296
The restraints are off!

498
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:42,632
( indistinct shouting )

499
00:30:45,218 --> 00:30:48,972
Slaves are loose! Slaves are loose!

500
00:30:49,055 --> 00:30:51,808
( alarm blaring )

501
00:31:02,485 --> 00:31:03,778
( groans )

502
00:31:03,862 --> 00:31:06,155
Trip, start beaming them, five at a time.

503
00:31:06,239 --> 00:31:07,407
( zaps )

504
00:31:10,827 --> 00:31:13,371
Sorry, Captain. Hope you find your people.

505
00:31:13,454 --> 00:31:14,747
Thanks for the ride.

506
00:31:22,255 --> 00:31:23,339
( gasps )

507
00:31:24,883 --> 00:31:26,175
You've got spirit.

508
00:31:26,259 --> 00:31:28,261
I might just keep you for myself.

509
00:31:29,137 --> 00:31:30,638
( groaning )

510
00:31:30,722 --> 00:31:32,140
I'm not for sale.

511
00:31:36,811 --> 00:31:38,813
Trip, have you got everyone?

512
00:31:38,897 --> 00:31:40,732
You and Soong are the only ones left.

513
00:31:40,815 --> 00:31:43,651
Soong got away.
Locate him and beam him up.

514
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:47,363
( grunts )

515
00:31:47,447 --> 00:31:48,448
( zaps )

516
00:31:48,531 --> 00:31:51,451
( grunts )

517
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,953
( screaming )

518
00:31:59,792 --> 00:32:02,045
Soong's transponder signal, it's dead.

519
00:32:02,128 --> 00:32:04,172
Can you scan for his bio-sign?

520
00:32:04,255 --> 00:32:06,341
We're trying,
but there's too many people down there.

521
00:32:06,424 --> 00:32:08,468
( indistinct shouting )

522
00:32:38,414 --> 00:32:39,791
( beeping )

523
00:32:39,874 --> 00:32:42,001
( grunting )

524
00:32:46,089 --> 00:32:47,757
( grunting )

525
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:49,425
MALE: Help me!

526
00:32:49,509 --> 00:32:51,719
( grunts )

527
00:32:51,803 --> 00:32:53,638
Don't let them take me!

528
00:33:07,026 --> 00:33:08,111
( grunts )

529
00:33:14,450 --> 00:33:15,868
( beeping )

530
00:33:15,952 --> 00:33:17,161
( exclaims )

531
00:33:19,664 --> 00:33:20,915
( communicator beeps )

532
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:23,710
Trip, two to beam up.

533
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:36,723
ARCHER: You knew exactly where
the Orions were operating.

534
00:33:36,806 --> 00:33:38,766
You knew they'd abduct members of my crew.

535
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:42,353
Maybe you were even hoping they'd get you.

536
00:33:42,437 --> 00:33:44,063
There was an outside chance.

537
00:33:44,147 --> 00:33:47,025
You were determined to escape,
no matter who got hurt.

538
00:33:47,108 --> 00:33:48,317
No one was injured.

539
00:33:48,401 --> 00:33:51,362
Nine of my people were
nearly sold into slavery.

540
00:33:51,446 --> 00:33:53,823
Two of them may have
permanent physical damage

541
00:33:53,906 --> 00:33:55,033
because of the restraints.

542
00:33:55,116 --> 00:33:57,160
I didn't take this action lightly.

543
00:33:57,243 --> 00:33:59,120
Is that supposed to justify what you did?

544
00:33:59,203 --> 00:34:04,625
I'm simply saying it wasn't easy for me
to place you and your crew in jeopardy.

545
00:34:06,335 --> 00:34:08,171
I respect you, Captain.

546
00:34:08,921 --> 00:34:10,715
Then tell me how to find the Augments.

547
00:34:12,592 --> 00:34:14,719
You know where they're going.

548
00:34:14,802 --> 00:34:18,347
They didn't steal a Klingon ship
to go sightseeing.

549
00:34:18,431 --> 00:34:19,515
They're dangerous.

550
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:21,267
They're the future.

551
00:34:21,350 --> 00:34:25,521
They're stronger, smarter,
free from sickness,

552
00:34:25,605 --> 00:34:28,691
with lifespans twice as long as our own.

553
00:34:28,775 --> 00:34:30,485
( sighs )

554
00:34:30,568 --> 00:34:33,196
You, more than anyone,
should appreciate what this means.

555
00:34:33,821 --> 00:34:34,822
Why me?

556
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:36,866
Your father...

557
00:34:36,949 --> 00:34:39,243
suffered from Clarke's Disease.

558
00:34:39,327 --> 00:34:43,039
His final years were marked
with extreme pain.

559
00:34:43,122 --> 00:34:45,083
My father has nothing to do with this.

560
00:34:45,166 --> 00:34:47,293
He didn't need to suffer.

561
00:34:47,376 --> 00:34:49,837
Genetic engineering could have cured him.

562
00:34:49,921 --> 00:34:51,881
Those who want to suppress my Augments

563
00:34:51,964 --> 00:34:56,302
are the same ones who condemned
your father to death.

564
00:34:56,385 --> 00:35:00,389
Turn the ship around, Captain. Go home.

565
00:35:00,473 --> 00:35:02,642
Leave them alone.

566
00:35:05,394 --> 00:35:08,022
I'm gonna find them, Doctor...

567
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:09,941
Whether you help me or not.

568
00:35:11,901 --> 00:35:14,403
( door opens )

569
00:35:28,417 --> 00:35:30,628
You're supposed to be resting.

570
00:35:30,711 --> 00:35:33,464
Dr. Phlox says I can resume
my duties this afternoon.

571
00:35:33,548 --> 00:35:35,716
I'm glad they got that thing off
with no problem.

572
00:35:36,342 --> 00:35:39,053
There's a slight ringing in my left ear,

573
00:35:39,137 --> 00:35:41,514
but it should dissipate over time.

574
00:35:41,597 --> 00:35:43,307
Good.

575
00:35:45,268 --> 00:35:47,228
Well, I'll let you get back to that.

576
00:35:49,021 --> 00:35:52,567
Vulcans don't have honeymoons.

577
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:57,155
After the ceremony,
I went to Mount Seleya to meditate...

578
00:35:57,238 --> 00:35:58,239
( clears throat )

579
00:35:58,322 --> 00:35:59,407
Alone.

580
00:36:00,908 --> 00:36:03,369
It's none of my business, anyway.

581
00:36:03,452 --> 00:36:05,621
( explosions )

582
00:36:05,705 --> 00:36:08,416
Orion interceptors, two of them,
coming up fast.

583
00:36:08,499 --> 00:36:10,585
-( beeping )
-They're hailing us.

584
00:36:10,668 --> 00:36:12,044
This is Captain Archer of the starship--

585
00:36:12,128 --> 00:36:13,754
MALE: <i>You've stolen our property.</i>

586
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:16,799
They were members of my crew.
You kidnapped them.

587
00:36:16,883 --> 00:36:20,386
<i>Disengage your warp drive</i>
<i>and deactivate your weapons.</i>

588
00:36:20,469 --> 00:36:22,221
That isn't going to happen.

589
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:25,766
Malcolm.

590
00:36:33,482 --> 00:36:35,401
They're targeting our Nacelles.

591
00:36:35,484 --> 00:36:37,236
We're dropping out of warp.

592
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:38,571
Torpedoes.

593
00:36:41,449 --> 00:36:42,700
There's another ship.

594
00:36:55,296 --> 00:36:57,840
The second Orion's veering off.
They're retreating.

595
00:36:57,924 --> 00:36:59,091
( beeping )

596
00:36:59,175 --> 00:37:00,885
The Klingons are requesting to dock.

597
00:37:13,439 --> 00:37:16,025
I know he's on this ship.

598
00:37:16,108 --> 00:37:18,194
We received his signal.

599
00:37:18,277 --> 00:37:22,240
When he tried to escape,
I saw him access a console.

600
00:37:22,323 --> 00:37:24,867
You were expecting us.

601
00:37:24,951 --> 00:37:26,494
Where is he?

602
00:37:26,577 --> 00:37:27,870
In the brig.

603
00:37:27,954 --> 00:37:31,165
In a prison cell.
I want to speak with him.

604
00:37:31,249 --> 00:37:32,458
I can't allow that.

605
00:37:32,541 --> 00:37:33,960
We saved your ship.

606
00:37:34,043 --> 00:37:37,755
My ship wouldn't have been in danger
if we hadn't come looking for you.

607
00:37:40,549 --> 00:37:42,218
What is it you want with us?

608
00:37:42,301 --> 00:37:44,303
My orders are to take you back to Earth.

609
00:37:45,263 --> 00:37:46,847
Earth...

610
00:37:46,931 --> 00:37:49,141
Considers my father a criminal.

611
00:37:49,225 --> 00:37:50,476
Why?

612
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:52,478
Because he brought us to life.

613
00:37:52,561 --> 00:37:56,399
You want to take us back to a world
that opposes our very existence.

614
00:37:56,482 --> 00:37:58,609
You attacked a Klingon vessel.

615
00:37:58,693 --> 00:38:00,194
They're threatening war.

616
00:38:00,278 --> 00:38:01,988
That's not our problem.

617
00:38:03,739 --> 00:38:07,326
We don't care what happens to you.

618
00:38:08,786 --> 00:38:10,746
Humanity is no longer relevant.

619
00:38:11,205 --> 00:38:15,001
To quote one of your philosophers...
Nietzsche...

620
00:38:17,044 --> 00:38:20,423
"Mankind is something to be surpassed."

621
00:38:23,092 --> 00:38:25,761
You think he was talking about you?

622
00:38:30,433 --> 00:38:32,143
I'm about to attack you.

623
00:38:33,477 --> 00:38:34,979
You see?

624
00:38:35,062 --> 00:38:38,107
Even with a warning,
you're not fast enough.

625
00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:39,358
Let him go.

626
00:38:39,442 --> 00:38:42,778
We have five times your strength,
double your intelligence.

627
00:38:42,862 --> 00:38:43,863
Let him go!

628
00:38:43,946 --> 00:38:45,990
I'll tear out his throat!

629
00:38:47,658 --> 00:38:49,201
Lower your weapons.

630
00:38:52,288 --> 00:38:53,372
Now.

631
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:04,008
Persis.

632
00:39:04,091 --> 00:39:06,510
I've broken their security code,
we're ready.

633
00:39:09,055 --> 00:39:10,181
( door opens )

634
00:39:20,775 --> 00:39:22,234
I'll kill him!

635
00:39:31,869 --> 00:39:33,621
( door opens )

636
00:39:33,704 --> 00:39:35,289
( grunts )

637
00:39:48,511 --> 00:39:49,678
Persis.

638
00:39:50,471 --> 00:39:51,639
Persis?

639
00:39:53,974 --> 00:39:55,976
I can't believe it.

640
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:57,478
( sighs )

641
00:40:03,818 --> 00:40:05,528
Father, here's Malik.

642
00:40:07,738 --> 00:40:08,823
Malik.

643
00:40:10,074 --> 00:40:11,325
( grunts )

644
00:40:17,748 --> 00:40:19,834
I knew we'd see each other again.

645
00:40:20,292 --> 00:40:22,044
I'm proud of you.

646
00:40:23,295 --> 00:40:24,797
Of all of you.

647
00:40:25,214 --> 00:40:27,591
Soong, listen to me.

648
00:40:28,008 --> 00:40:29,552
There's nothing to say, Captain.

649
00:40:29,635 --> 00:40:31,846
What should we do with them?

650
00:40:31,929 --> 00:40:33,431
Let them go.

651
00:40:33,514 --> 00:40:35,391
But they'll just come after us.

652
00:40:35,474 --> 00:40:37,184
Their ship's disabled.

653
00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:41,105
By the time it's repaired,
we'll be far away.

654
00:40:41,188 --> 00:40:42,690
It's been a pleasure, Captain.

655
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:47,736
Take my advice.

656
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:50,573
Go home and start learning
how to speak Klingon.

657
00:41:11,927 --> 00:41:15,556
There were times, back on Earth,

658
00:41:15,639 --> 00:41:18,559
when I doubted myself,

659
00:41:18,642 --> 00:41:20,060
my work.

660
00:41:21,562 --> 00:41:24,648
But seeing you all,

661
00:41:24,732 --> 00:41:27,359
I know that everything
I've fought for was worth it.

662
00:41:28,819 --> 00:41:31,405
We're going to build a new world.

663
00:41:31,489 --> 00:41:35,075
But we can't begin that task just yet.

664
00:41:35,159 --> 00:41:38,996
Thousands of your brothers and sisters
are waiting to be born.

665
00:41:42,833 --> 00:41:44,752
Let's go get them.
