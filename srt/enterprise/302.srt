1
00:00:14,139 --> 00:00:15,181
( whines )

2
00:00:20,812 --> 00:00:21,688
( barks )

3
00:00:23,022 --> 00:00:23,857
( barks )

4
00:00:25,608 --> 00:00:27,110
Come here.

5
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:30,363
What's the problem?

6
00:00:30,447 --> 00:00:32,032
( thud )

7
00:00:52,135 --> 00:00:53,845
Commander.

8
00:00:58,224 --> 00:01:01,394
This can't be right.
Did you run a diagnostic?

9
00:01:01,478 --> 00:01:02,854
Twice.

10
00:01:02,937 --> 00:01:04,439
Let's check those relays.

11
00:01:05,356 --> 00:01:07,192
( chirping )

12
00:01:15,575 --> 00:01:17,660
( indistinct talking )

13
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:18,953
Oh!

14
00:01:40,892 --> 00:01:43,478
-( beeps )
<i>-Captain to the bridge.</i>

15
00:01:46,231 --> 00:01:48,316
-( beeping )
-We're getting reports of anomalies

16
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:50,860
from all over the ship.

17
00:01:51,361 --> 00:01:53,488
The warp field's fluctuating.

18
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:58,034
<i>Bridge to engineering. Report.</i>

19
00:01:58,118 --> 00:01:59,494
I don't get it, Captain.

20
00:01:59,577 --> 00:02:02,163
Half the plasma relays
have reversed polarity.

21
00:02:02,247 --> 00:02:03,498
<i>Shut down the reactor.</i>

22
00:02:03,581 --> 00:02:06,543
I'm trying. But it's not cooperating.

23
00:02:07,085 --> 00:02:09,045
We're losing main power.

24
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:13,675
Now.

25
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:49,270
I've restored emergency power,

26
00:03:49,354 --> 00:03:51,773
but most of our primary systems
are still off-line.

27
00:03:51,856 --> 00:03:53,483
Including weapons.

28
00:03:54,317 --> 00:03:55,735
Trip, what's your status?

29
00:03:56,027 --> 00:03:58,279
We've got a hell of a mess
down here, Captain.

30
00:03:58,363 --> 00:04:00,240
It's gonna be a while before
I can even figure out

31
00:04:00,323 --> 00:04:01,407
what just happened.

32
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:03,076
<i>Keep me posted.</i>

33
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:06,162
Sir, I'm picking up a vessel.

34
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:07,705
Eight million kilometers off port.

35
00:04:07,789 --> 00:04:09,415
What's their heading?

36
00:04:09,707 --> 00:04:11,668
Looks like they're holding position.

37
00:04:11,751 --> 00:04:13,670
Or they could be adrift.

38
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:14,796
Hail them.

39
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:16,881
Our transceiver's off-line.

40
00:04:18,466 --> 00:04:19,676
What's our best speed?

41
00:04:19,968 --> 00:04:21,678
One-quarter impulse.

42
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,888
Set a course.

43
00:04:33,982 --> 00:04:34,899
{\an8}Bio-signs?

44
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:37,485
{\an8}-( beeping )
-None.

45
00:04:37,568 --> 00:04:39,696
{\an8}And there's no atmosphere aboard.

46
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:42,073
{\an8}Artificial gravity's down as well.

47
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:48,538
{\an8}Any sign of what happened to them?

48
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:50,790
{\an8}No, sir.

49
00:04:56,587 --> 00:04:58,715
{\an8}Have you spent much time
in gravity boots, Corporal?

50
00:04:58,798 --> 00:05:00,675
{\an8}I did a six-week tour on Jupiter station.

51
00:05:00,758 --> 00:05:02,677
{\an8}The grav-plating went down a few times.

52
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:05,680
{\an8}-Only in simulations, sir.
-Same here, Captain.

53
00:05:05,763 --> 00:05:07,640
{\an8}ARCHER:
This is an alien ship we're boarding.

54
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:09,600
{\an8}We could run into magnetic variances.

55
00:05:09,684 --> 00:05:10,643
{\an8}Watch your step.

56
00:05:10,727 --> 00:05:11,728
{\an8}-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

57
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:14,981
{\an8}ARCHER: We're looking for anything
that could tell us what happened to them.

58
00:05:15,064 --> 00:05:16,941
{\an8}And don't forget...

59
00:05:17,025 --> 00:05:19,152
{\an8}Just because sensors didn't pick up
any bio-signs

60
00:05:19,235 --> 00:05:21,654
{\an8}doesn't mean we won't encounter anyone.

61
00:05:21,738 --> 00:05:24,282
{\an8}-Set weapons to stun.
-Aye, sir.

62
00:06:05,656 --> 00:06:06,783
( beeping )

63
00:06:08,701 --> 00:06:10,078
Weapons fire.

64
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:17,543
( grunting )

65
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:21,881
( gasps )

66
00:06:23,591 --> 00:06:24,842
Captain.

67
00:06:30,723 --> 00:06:32,809
No external injuries.

68
00:06:36,813 --> 00:06:38,439
Let's find the bridge.

69
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:06,843
Try to access that station.

70
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:08,594
Download what you can.

71
00:07:17,895 --> 00:07:20,148
We counted 17 bodies.

72
00:07:20,231 --> 00:07:22,567
Most of them died
when their life support ran out.

73
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:25,069
The others were killed
by particle weapons.

74
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:27,113
What's our status?

75
00:07:27,196 --> 00:07:29,949
Ensign Sato managed to bring
the transceiver online.

76
00:07:30,032 --> 00:07:31,200
But other than that...

77
00:07:35,037 --> 00:07:37,498
-Archer to Mayweather.
<i>-Go ahead, Captain.</i>

78
00:07:37,582 --> 00:07:39,459
Resume our previous course,
one-quarter impulse.

79
00:07:39,542 --> 00:07:41,043
<i>Understood.</i>

80
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:44,964
It might be best to complete repairs
before we head deeper into the expanse.

81
00:07:45,047 --> 00:07:46,841
If we encounter any more anomalies...

82
00:07:46,924 --> 00:07:49,385
Those people have been dead
for less than two days.

83
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:51,512
Whoever attacked them
could still be nearby.

84
00:07:51,596 --> 00:07:53,264
We'll have to make repairs on the move.

85
00:07:53,347 --> 00:07:55,433
Mr. Reed recovered some data
from their bridge.

86
00:07:55,516 --> 00:07:56,893
See what you can make of it.

87
00:07:56,976 --> 00:07:59,061
Let's try it again.

88
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:01,397
Watch that intermix ratio.

89
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:03,941
( whirring )

90
00:08:04,025 --> 00:08:05,318
Looking good.

91
00:08:06,611 --> 00:08:08,696
Bring her up to 40%.

92
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:13,826
Shut it down! Shut it down!

93
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:15,786
( indistinct talking )

94
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:19,165
-How's it coming?
-Could be better.

95
00:08:19,248 --> 00:08:24,128
Creating a stable warp field isn't easy
when the laws of physics won't cooperate.

96
00:08:24,212 --> 00:08:27,673
The Cochrane equation...
It's not constant here.

97
00:08:27,757 --> 00:08:29,800
The problem's in the quantum variables.

98
00:08:29,884 --> 00:08:31,886
Every time I try to compensate,

99
00:08:31,969 --> 00:08:34,722
the spatial gradients
get thrown out of whack.

100
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:37,558
Either we get away from these anomalies,

101
00:08:37,642 --> 00:08:40,228
or we're gonna have to rewrite
the book on warp theory.

102
00:08:40,311 --> 00:08:41,771
And I don't have to tell you how long

103
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:44,148
it took Zefram Cochrane
the first time around.

104
00:08:44,232 --> 00:08:46,150
What about tactical systems?

105
00:08:46,234 --> 00:08:48,277
Weapons should be up and running
within an hour or two.

106
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:49,820
Make it a priority.

107
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:52,990
-You worried about something?
-Weapons, Trip.

108
00:08:53,074 --> 00:08:54,909
As quickly as you can.

109
00:08:57,161 --> 00:08:59,038
Where's Isaac Newton when you need him?

110
00:09:35,032 --> 00:09:36,284
Distance?

111
00:09:36,367 --> 00:09:38,703
3,000 meters and closing.

112
00:09:38,786 --> 00:09:40,955
They're charging weapons.

113
00:09:41,038 --> 00:09:42,873
Can you give me hull plating?

114
00:09:42,957 --> 00:09:44,458
I'm sorry, sir.

115
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:46,043
Hail them.

116
00:09:47,128 --> 00:09:48,546
( beeping )

117
00:09:50,131 --> 00:09:52,216
2,000 meters.

118
00:10:02,226 --> 00:10:03,311
( yells )

119
00:10:24,498 --> 00:10:25,750
( grunts )

120
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:50,149
( gun fires )

121
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,700
Hold your fire.

122
00:11:01,786 --> 00:11:03,996
-Are those warheads armed?
-Yeah.

123
00:11:05,998 --> 00:11:07,249
Stun grenade.

124
00:11:13,255 --> 00:11:14,173
Go!

125
00:11:24,392 --> 00:11:25,601
How many more?

126
00:11:26,894 --> 00:11:29,814
Two in cargo bay 1.
Four more in engineering.

127
00:11:29,897 --> 00:11:31,315
Get down there and help Trip.

128
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:34,318
Corporal.

129
00:11:34,402 --> 00:11:36,320
Woods, you're with me.

130
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:56,424
( beeping )

131
00:11:56,841 --> 00:11:58,592
They're trying to download our database.

132
00:12:00,261 --> 00:12:01,470
Lock them out.

133
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:40,945
Increase his inaprovaline
by 50 milligrams.

134
00:13:41,028 --> 00:13:42,780
How are they?

135
00:13:42,863 --> 00:13:44,532
Stable.

136
00:13:44,615 --> 00:13:46,742
However, they've suffered
extensive disruptor burns.

137
00:13:46,825 --> 00:13:48,702
I'd like to start them
on regeneration therapy,

138
00:13:48,786 --> 00:13:50,538
but the imaging chamber
was damaged in the attack.

139
00:13:50,621 --> 00:13:53,082
I'll need a repair team
as soon as possible.

140
00:13:53,165 --> 00:13:54,625
Understood.

141
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:10,140
Crewman Fuller. I did everything I could.

142
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:14,478
-What about him?
-A few internal injuries.

143
00:14:14,562 --> 00:14:16,188
I'll need to keep him under observation.

144
00:14:16,272 --> 00:14:18,148
You can observe him in the brig.

145
00:14:18,232 --> 00:14:20,025
-See to it.
-Aye, sir.

146
00:14:20,109 --> 00:14:22,987
You might be interested to know
that I recognize his species.

147
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:25,948
-He's Osaarian.
-He's not from the expanse?

148
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:27,825
Not originally.

149
00:14:32,454 --> 00:14:33,914
How bad is it?

150
00:14:33,998 --> 00:14:35,833
They made off
with three photonic torpedoes,

151
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:38,752
a case of plasma rifles,
two dozen stun grenades.

152
00:14:38,836 --> 00:14:41,881
Chef says they cleaned out
half the food stores.

153
00:14:41,964 --> 00:14:44,383
And cargo bay 2 has been
stripped to the bulkheads.

154
00:14:44,466 --> 00:14:46,343
But that's not the worst of it.

155
00:14:46,427 --> 00:14:48,846
They took every one of our
antimatter storage pods.

156
00:14:48,929 --> 00:14:51,640
All we've got left
is what's in the main reactor.

157
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:54,101
How long will that last? A month?

158
00:14:54,184 --> 00:14:55,227
Tops.

159
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:57,521
After that, we're out of gas.

160
00:15:05,362 --> 00:15:07,239
This is all you've got?

161
00:15:07,323 --> 00:15:10,492
The high command hasn't had
much contact with the Osaarians.

162
00:15:11,493 --> 00:15:13,913
They have a large merchant fleet,

163
00:15:13,996 --> 00:15:16,832
but there's no record of piracy.

164
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:19,835
-Any luck tracking their ship?
-Not yet.

165
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:22,004
They've found a way
to mask their ion trail.

166
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:26,508
For people with no history of piracy,
they've gotten pretty good at it.

167
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:29,511
Keep looking.

168
00:15:30,471 --> 00:15:32,932
It appears they've adapted
their weapons and engines

169
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:34,725
to compensate for the anomalies.

170
00:15:35,017 --> 00:15:36,769
Pursuing them will be dangerous.

171
00:15:36,852 --> 00:15:38,687
We should consider other alternatives.

172
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:40,230
Such as what?

173
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:42,733
Waiting for our antimatter to run dry?

174
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:47,363
I'm only suggesting that we may be able
to replenish our supplies elsewhere.

175
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:49,198
Keep looking.

176
00:15:57,206 --> 00:15:58,457
Open it.

177
00:16:11,512 --> 00:16:13,055
( beeps )

178
00:16:13,138 --> 00:16:15,432
Dr. Phlox said your injuries were minor.

179
00:16:21,021 --> 00:16:22,439
Please get up.

180
00:16:23,357 --> 00:16:24,817
Why?

181
00:16:25,734 --> 00:16:27,569
I have a dead crewman.

182
00:16:28,737 --> 00:16:30,364
I didn't kill him.

183
00:16:30,447 --> 00:16:34,076
No. One of your friends did.

184
00:16:35,744 --> 00:16:38,372
But I don't have one of your friends,
I have you.

185
00:16:38,455 --> 00:16:40,958
So get up and look at me.

186
00:16:45,295 --> 00:16:46,213
Thank you.

187
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:50,217
You're going to help me find your ship.

188
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:51,885
( chuckles )

189
00:16:51,969 --> 00:16:54,388
And after I've taken back
what they stole from me,

190
00:16:54,471 --> 00:16:58,517
you and your colleagues... are free to go.

191
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:02,563
If you went anywhere near that ship,
you'd have more than one dead crewman.

192
00:17:03,188 --> 00:17:04,523
I can't help you.

193
00:17:04,606 --> 00:17:07,067
Even if I could,
my captain wouldn't be very interested

194
00:17:07,151 --> 00:17:10,320
in having me back, would he?

195
00:17:10,404 --> 00:17:12,531
Not after I told you where to find him.

196
00:17:12,614 --> 00:17:15,159
That's a risk you'll have to take.

197
00:17:15,242 --> 00:17:19,121
Because the alternative
is going to be a lot less pleasant.

198
00:17:20,664 --> 00:17:23,792
( chuckles ) I don't think
you'd be very comfortable

199
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:25,461
torturing another man.

200
00:17:26,128 --> 00:17:29,423
You and your crewmates
are far too civilized for that.

201
00:17:30,132 --> 00:17:31,425
Too moral.

202
00:17:31,508 --> 00:17:33,510
I need what was stolen from me.

203
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:37,014
There's too much at stake to let my...

204
00:17:37,765 --> 00:17:40,642
morality get in the way.

205
00:17:41,226 --> 00:17:44,354
You're obviously new to this expanse.

206
00:17:44,438 --> 00:17:47,483
If you weren't, your ship's hull
would be insulated with trellium-d.

207
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:49,985
Do you have any idea
what a spatial distortion

208
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:53,447
can do to a ship
that is not insulated with trellium-d?

209
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:56,033
What it can do...

210
00:17:56,116 --> 00:17:58,660
to the people inside that ship?

211
00:18:00,621 --> 00:18:02,790
You masked your ion trail. How?

212
00:18:03,123 --> 00:18:04,541
( scoffs )

213
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:05,959
Well...

214
00:18:06,668 --> 00:18:08,962
My captain's a very clever man.

215
00:18:10,464 --> 00:18:12,049
He has to be.

216
00:18:12,132 --> 00:18:15,177
When you're forced to resort to
desperate measures in order to survive,

217
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:17,262
you have to be clever.

218
00:18:18,806 --> 00:18:21,058
You need to know how to hide.

219
00:18:21,141 --> 00:18:23,852
So you were forced into piracy.

220
00:18:29,274 --> 00:18:32,903
When we entered this expanse,
we were no different than you.

221
00:18:32,986 --> 00:18:35,823
Two merchant ships
looking for trade routes.

222
00:18:36,657 --> 00:18:38,992
Then the first distortion hit us.

223
00:18:39,993 --> 00:18:42,037
We decided to return home.

224
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:45,666
But the perimeter,
the thermobaric clouds,

225
00:18:45,749 --> 00:18:49,169
they let you in,
but they don't let you out.

226
00:18:51,171 --> 00:18:53,340
One of our ships was destroyed trying.

227
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:56,718
After a few more encounters
with the anomalies,`

228
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:59,638
it wasn't long before we became predators.

229
00:18:59,721 --> 00:19:03,475
This section of the expanse
proved to be ideal for hunting.

230
00:19:05,435 --> 00:19:09,565
When a ship runs aground
due to spatial distortions,

231
00:19:09,648 --> 00:19:12,109
it becomes an easy target.

232
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:19,408
Our captain told us
we wouldn't harm anyone.

233
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:20,993
And we didn't.

234
00:19:21,785 --> 00:19:23,203
Not at first.

235
00:19:25,247 --> 00:19:27,958
It takes time to learn to kill
without remorse.

236
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:31,420
You're not prepared to kill.

237
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:32,754
Or torture.

238
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:35,591
( scoffs ) Not yet.

239
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:40,470
I'm prepared to do whatever
it takes to find your ship.

240
00:19:40,554 --> 00:19:43,223
And if that ends up causing me remorse...

241
00:19:46,268 --> 00:19:49,438
Then it's something
I'm willing to live with.

242
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:50,898
Think about it.

243
00:20:11,335 --> 00:20:13,587
I've been studying the data
recovered from the derelict.

244
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:17,299
Apparently they decided to look
for the Osaarians as well.

245
00:20:18,842 --> 00:20:23,055
They found a way to modify their sensors
to detect the ion trail,

246
00:20:23,138 --> 00:20:26,725
but their life support failed
before they had a chance to start.

247
00:20:26,808 --> 00:20:28,894
Did they leave a record
of the modifications?

248
00:20:28,977 --> 00:20:31,188
I've already given it
to Ensign Mayweather.

249
00:20:31,271 --> 00:20:33,440
-What's our tactical situation?
-Hull plating's back online.

250
00:20:33,523 --> 00:20:35,609
We should have phase cannons
within the hour.

251
00:20:35,692 --> 00:20:36,860
Torpedoes?

252
00:20:36,944 --> 00:20:38,654
Lieutenant Reed is still having difficulty

253
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:41,949
modifying the guidance systems
to compensate for the anomalies.

254
00:20:42,616 --> 00:20:43,825
I'll be in the armory.

255
00:20:57,422 --> 00:20:58,924
( beeping )

256
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:00,592
Black tea, hot.

257
00:21:02,803 --> 00:21:05,138
You finished rewriting the physics books?

258
00:21:05,222 --> 00:21:09,559
I don't think I'll be taking home
the Nobel Prize any time soon.

259
00:21:09,643 --> 00:21:12,604
A few hours rest
might do you a world of good.

260
00:21:12,688 --> 00:21:14,606
No kidding.

261
00:21:15,232 --> 00:21:16,525
You still can't sleep?

262
00:21:17,776 --> 00:21:19,528
T'Pol's been trying to help,

263
00:21:19,611 --> 00:21:22,572
showing me how to
stimulate my neural nodes.

264
00:21:24,491 --> 00:21:26,076
It's not what you think.

265
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:27,703
Oh, I wasn't thinking anything.

266
00:21:29,496 --> 00:21:31,373
How are the weapons coming?

267
00:21:31,456 --> 00:21:34,710
The Captain and I managed to bring
the guidance systems online,

268
00:21:34,793 --> 00:21:38,422
but I'm gonna need more time
for the aft launchers.

269
00:21:39,381 --> 00:21:43,510
Fuller knew those torpedo systems
better than anyone.

270
00:21:45,345 --> 00:21:47,014
He won't be easy to replace.

271
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,350
Considering all the hostile aliens
we've met,

272
00:21:50,434 --> 00:21:54,771
I suppose it's fortunate
we haven't lost more people.

273
00:21:55,814 --> 00:21:57,399
I doubt he'll be the last.

274
00:21:58,775 --> 00:22:00,569
There's no reason to get cynical.

275
00:22:01,194 --> 00:22:04,072
Every species we run into
seems to be gunning for us.

276
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:07,200
We might as well paint
a giant bull's-eye on the hull.

277
00:22:07,284 --> 00:22:09,119
What do you suggest we do?

278
00:22:09,202 --> 00:22:11,038
Turn around and go back to Earth?

279
00:22:12,622 --> 00:22:13,999
All I'm saying is that this mission,

280
00:22:14,082 --> 00:22:15,834
whether it succeeds or not,

281
00:22:15,917 --> 00:22:18,378
is looking like
a one-way ticket all the time.

282
00:22:21,131 --> 00:22:23,342
<i>Captain's starlog, supplemental.</i>

283
00:22:23,425 --> 00:22:25,761
<i>We've been tracking </i>
<i>the Osaarians' ion trail</i>

284
00:22:25,844 --> 00:22:27,095
<i>for the past four hours.</i>

285
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:29,931
<i>There's still no sign of them.</i>

286
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:33,769
The trail ends
about 20,000 kilometers ahead.

287
00:22:34,853 --> 00:22:36,229
Any sign of a ship?

288
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:39,441
Nothing.

289
00:22:39,524 --> 00:22:40,776
T'Pol?

290
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:42,944
Curious.

291
00:22:43,779 --> 00:22:46,740
The trail resumes after
another 70,000 kilometers.

292
00:22:48,742 --> 00:22:49,910
Let's see it.

293
00:22:53,163 --> 00:22:54,414
Should I alter course?

294
00:22:54,498 --> 00:22:55,874
Not yet.

295
00:22:57,834 --> 00:23:00,462
Why would there be such a large gap?

296
00:23:01,588 --> 00:23:04,925
The ions may have been dispersed
by stellar winds.

297
00:23:05,008 --> 00:23:07,177
There would still be
some residual particles.

298
00:23:07,803 --> 00:23:09,137
Captain.

299
00:23:09,596 --> 00:23:12,349
The particle decay rates don't match.

300
00:23:12,432 --> 00:23:15,227
This one is at least nine hours old.

301
00:23:16,228 --> 00:23:18,897
This one was left less than an hour ago.

302
00:23:21,525 --> 00:23:23,318
Bring weapons online.

303
00:23:24,277 --> 00:23:26,696
Take us to where the first trail ends.

304
00:23:31,493 --> 00:23:32,828
( rumbling )

305
00:23:34,913 --> 00:23:36,206
Travis?

306
00:23:37,082 --> 00:23:38,416
I'm not reading anything.

307
00:23:48,135 --> 00:23:49,469
Power's fluctuating.

308
00:23:51,138 --> 00:23:52,681
Forward plating's down.

309
00:23:52,764 --> 00:23:54,933
Microfractures are forming
on the outer hull.

310
00:23:55,016 --> 00:23:56,143
We should come about.

311
00:23:56,226 --> 00:23:57,602
Keep going.

312
00:24:10,198 --> 00:24:11,408
T'Pol.

313
00:24:11,741 --> 00:24:14,202
It's approximately
19 kilometers in diameter.

314
00:24:15,579 --> 00:24:17,164
Ever seen anything like it?

315
00:24:17,998 --> 00:24:19,249
No.

316
00:24:19,958 --> 00:24:22,794
It's constructed entirely
of a single alloy.

317
00:24:22,878 --> 00:24:24,838
Who could build something that big?

318
00:24:25,964 --> 00:24:27,340
Take us in closer.

319
00:24:37,893 --> 00:24:39,644
That cloaking field is enormous.

320
00:24:40,103 --> 00:24:41,271
Whoever built this thing

321
00:24:41,354 --> 00:24:43,398
went to a great deal of trouble
to conceal it.

322
00:24:43,481 --> 00:24:45,775
Judging from those ion trails,

323
00:24:45,859 --> 00:24:47,569
the Osaarians spent over eight hours here.

324
00:24:47,652 --> 00:24:48,737
I want to find out why.

325
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:50,739
Any luck scanning the interior?

326
00:24:50,822 --> 00:24:52,866
Our sensors are being deflected.

327
00:24:53,533 --> 00:24:56,745
See if you can find something
that looks like a way in.

328
00:24:56,828 --> 00:24:58,330
Take us into orbit.

329
00:25:10,842 --> 00:25:13,428
I'm detecting what appears to be a portal.

330
00:25:13,511 --> 00:25:15,680
22 degrees north of our current position.

331
00:25:15,764 --> 00:25:17,098
Put it up.

332
00:25:20,644 --> 00:25:22,646
Can you tell what the door's made of?

333
00:25:22,729 --> 00:25:24,898
Polyduranium.

334
00:25:24,981 --> 00:25:27,400
The same metal as the Osaarian's hull.

335
00:25:29,444 --> 00:25:30,737
Can we fit through?

336
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:32,197
Not with <i>Enterprise.</i>

337
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,910
Then get a pod ready.

338
00:25:50,882 --> 00:25:52,133
( beeping )

339
00:25:52,217 --> 00:25:53,843
I've cycled through
the standard frequencies.

340
00:25:53,927 --> 00:25:55,553
Did you find the locking mechanism?

341
00:25:55,637 --> 00:25:56,930
On the lower right side.

342
00:25:57,681 --> 00:25:58,765
Hold our position.

343
00:26:07,816 --> 00:26:08,900
Try it now.

344
00:26:18,743 --> 00:26:21,454
There's no indication of any ships, sir.

345
00:26:21,538 --> 00:26:23,748
-( beeps )
-Archer to <i>Enterprise.</i>

346
00:26:24,291 --> 00:26:25,583
<i>Go ahead.</i>

347
00:26:26,918 --> 00:26:29,546
-We're heading in.
<i>-Understood.</i>

348
00:26:47,605 --> 00:26:50,775
There's enough energy running through here
to power a dozen cities.

349
00:26:51,943 --> 00:26:52,861
( rumbling )

350
00:26:56,364 --> 00:26:58,908
What's that? Down there.

351
00:27:05,707 --> 00:27:07,000
( beeping )

352
00:27:09,002 --> 00:27:11,588
Those modules
have a breathable atmosphere.

353
00:27:14,132 --> 00:27:15,967
Let's hope there's no one home.

354
00:27:16,051 --> 00:27:17,969
Do you see that docking port, Ensign?

355
00:27:18,345 --> 00:27:19,929
Yes, sir.

356
00:27:38,448 --> 00:27:39,866
( beeps )

357
00:27:39,949 --> 00:27:41,368
We're all clear, sir.

358
00:27:51,127 --> 00:27:52,462
They've been busy.

359
00:27:54,089 --> 00:27:56,591
There are a lot of modules to search.

360
00:27:56,674 --> 00:27:59,219
Fan out. Keep open com links.

361
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:12,941
They're not going to run out of
stem bolts any time soon.

362
00:28:15,735 --> 00:28:17,070
This way.

363
00:28:27,205 --> 00:28:28,957
Starfleet ration packs.

364
00:28:39,843 --> 00:28:41,344
( communicator beeps )

365
00:28:41,428 --> 00:28:43,972
-Archer.
<i>-I've found something, Captain.</i>

366
00:28:48,435 --> 00:28:50,603
-Travis?
-Over here, sir.

367
00:28:55,817 --> 00:28:58,319
I'm pretty sure it's a cargo manifest.

368
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:00,530
How's your Osaarian?

369
00:29:00,613 --> 00:29:02,991
Not very good, sir.

370
00:29:03,074 --> 00:29:05,076
Download what you can. Get it to Hoshi.

371
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:07,203
Tell T'Pol we're gonna need
another search team.

372
00:29:07,287 --> 00:29:09,247
-Aye, sir.
-( rumbling )

373
00:29:12,333 --> 00:29:14,377
Check behind those canisters.

374
00:29:20,592 --> 00:29:23,011
( indistinct talking )

375
00:29:23,094 --> 00:29:24,471
I need help here.

376
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:42,447
Look at this.

377
00:30:03,259 --> 00:30:05,345
( indistinct talking )

378
00:30:12,727 --> 00:30:14,270
( breathing heavily )

379
00:30:17,023 --> 00:30:19,734
-Commander?
-I had a little accident, doc.

380
00:30:20,151 --> 00:30:22,487
I was reinstalling
the deuterium injectors.

381
00:30:22,570 --> 00:30:24,948
One of them must have had
a little juice left in it.

382
00:30:25,031 --> 00:30:26,658
Second-degree burn.

383
00:30:26,741 --> 00:30:29,035
Hmm. Why don't you have a seat?

384
00:30:30,411 --> 00:30:31,788
( groans )

385
00:30:32,372 --> 00:30:34,958
I could have sworn that injector
was depolarized.

386
00:30:35,792 --> 00:30:38,628
I guess I'm getting a little punchy.

387
00:30:38,711 --> 00:30:41,339
When's the last time you've slept?

388
00:30:41,422 --> 00:30:43,174
I got a full hour last night.

389
00:30:43,258 --> 00:30:45,885
I'm surprised the neuropressure
isn't helping.

390
00:30:45,969 --> 00:30:48,638
T'Pol told me
your first treatment went well.

391
00:30:48,721 --> 00:30:51,057
Well, we only had the one session.

392
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:53,268
Haven't had a lot of free time lately.

393
00:30:53,351 --> 00:30:55,061
Are you certain that's the reason?

394
00:30:55,645 --> 00:30:56,980
What do you mean?

395
00:30:57,063 --> 00:30:59,691
Vulcan neuropressure requires
a certain degree of intimacy.

396
00:30:59,774 --> 00:31:02,694
I can understand that it might
make you, uh, uncomfortable.

397
00:31:03,278 --> 00:31:05,321
It doesn't make me uncomfortable.

398
00:31:05,405 --> 00:31:09,325
I just can't afford to spend
an hour every night in T'Pol's quarters.

399
00:31:09,409 --> 00:31:11,369
Can't you just give me
another one of those injections?

400
00:31:11,452 --> 00:31:12,871
They put me out like a light.

401
00:31:13,329 --> 00:31:17,292
They're not meant to be taken
for extended periods.

402
00:31:17,375 --> 00:31:20,628
There is another treatment
that might be helpful.

403
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:22,422
All right. What have you got?

404
00:31:22,964 --> 00:31:24,632
Aldebaran mud leeches.

405
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:26,467
What am I supposed to do with them?

406
00:31:26,551 --> 00:31:29,053
Place one on your chest
and one on your abdomen

407
00:31:29,137 --> 00:31:30,597
an hour before going to bed.

408
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:33,224
Their secretions act
as a natural sedative.

409
00:31:33,308 --> 00:31:35,894
Oh, uh, please...
Be careful to sleep on your back.

410
00:31:36,311 --> 00:31:39,272
If you roll over, you might anger them.

411
00:31:39,355 --> 00:31:42,191
Maybe an hour a night with T'Pol
isn't so bad.

412
00:31:42,275 --> 00:31:46,154
The search teams have found
nearly 80% of our antimatter.

413
00:31:46,237 --> 00:31:47,614
They're looking for the rest.

414
00:31:47,697 --> 00:31:51,075
Probably running through
the reactor of that Osaarian ship.

415
00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:53,536
We've also recovered most of our weapons.

416
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:55,079
How's Trip doing?

417
00:31:55,163 --> 00:31:57,874
He'll have warp drive online
within the next 30 minutes.

418
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:00,335
Have the away team speed it up.

419
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:04,339
I want to go to warp
as soon as they're back.

420
00:32:06,215 --> 00:32:09,302
Quantum scans indicate
it's nearly 1,000 years old.

421
00:32:09,385 --> 00:32:10,720
What else?

422
00:32:10,803 --> 00:32:13,181
The structure contains
seven fusion reactors.

423
00:32:13,264 --> 00:32:15,892
Each one is almost 12 kilometers long.

424
00:32:15,975 --> 00:32:17,852
Only three are still operational.

425
00:32:17,936 --> 00:32:20,021
Any idea what they were designed for?

426
00:32:20,104 --> 00:32:23,858
The sphere is emitting massive
amounts of gravimetric energy.

427
00:32:23,942 --> 00:32:27,236
It may have something to do
with the spatial anomalies.

428
00:32:30,323 --> 00:32:31,783
Take as many scans as you can.

429
00:32:31,866 --> 00:32:34,494
-( beeps )
<i>-Bridge to Captain Archer.</i>

430
00:32:34,577 --> 00:32:36,162
Go ahead.

431
00:32:36,245 --> 00:32:38,331
<i>Sir, could you come</i>
<i>to the situation room?</i>

432
00:32:41,292 --> 00:32:43,670
While I was translating
the cargo manifest,

433
00:32:43,753 --> 00:32:45,630
something caught my eye.

434
00:32:45,713 --> 00:32:47,715
Look at these markings.

435
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:51,135
I had to double-check,
but I was pretty sure

436
00:32:51,219 --> 00:32:53,930
that I had seen this ideography before.

437
00:32:54,764 --> 00:32:58,101
This is a piece of the Xindi probe
that crashed on Earth.

438
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:02,355
At least three of the symbols
are an exact match.

439
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:11,114
( beeps )

440
00:33:11,197 --> 00:33:13,741
Your ship attacked a Xindi vessel.

441
00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:16,369
I want to know everything
you can tell me about them.

442
00:33:16,452 --> 00:33:17,412
Xindi?

443
00:33:20,248 --> 00:33:21,374
You heard me.

444
00:33:22,792 --> 00:33:24,836
I don't remember a species with that name.

445
00:33:24,919 --> 00:33:26,546
You're lying!

446
00:33:26,629 --> 00:33:29,340
The manifest said you took their ship
less than two weeks ago!

447
00:33:29,424 --> 00:33:32,093
-What manifest?
-Tell me what you know.

448
00:33:34,178 --> 00:33:36,931
It was a small ship.
They were no match for us.

449
00:33:37,432 --> 00:33:38,933
Where are they now?

450
00:33:41,227 --> 00:33:42,270
( snorts )

451
00:33:43,771 --> 00:33:45,314
You destroyed them?

452
00:33:45,398 --> 00:33:48,693
They resisted. We had no choice.

453
00:33:48,776 --> 00:33:49,944
Where did they come from?

454
00:33:50,319 --> 00:33:54,407
I have better things to do
than familiarize myself with our victims.

455
00:33:54,490 --> 00:33:56,576
Which species of Xindi were they?

456
00:33:56,659 --> 00:33:59,829
-What did they look like?
-I don't remember.

457
00:33:59,912 --> 00:34:01,122
( beeps )

458
00:34:04,625 --> 00:34:06,294
Are you sure?

459
00:34:06,377 --> 00:34:08,129
Your threats aren't very convincing.

460
00:34:08,212 --> 00:34:10,131
I told you, you're too civilized.

461
00:34:10,214 --> 00:34:11,758
We'll see about that.

462
00:34:14,302 --> 00:34:16,888
-Sir?
-As you were.

463
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:18,848
Ensign.

464
00:34:18,931 --> 00:34:21,225
Are you taking me to your torture chamber?

465
00:34:21,309 --> 00:34:22,477
Shut up.

466
00:34:23,686 --> 00:34:24,979
Get in.

467
00:34:30,443 --> 00:34:31,986
( beeps )

468
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,405
The Xindi.

469
00:34:34,989 --> 00:34:37,033
This tactic doesn't suit you, Captain.

470
00:34:37,742 --> 00:34:41,621
This airlock has a decompression rate
of 0.5 atmospheres per minute.

471
00:34:49,754 --> 00:34:50,922
( beeps )

472
00:34:52,173 --> 00:34:53,800
You'd better start talking now.

473
00:34:53,883 --> 00:34:57,386
Because in about 40 seconds
you won't be able to.

474
00:34:57,470 --> 00:34:59,180
( gasping )

475
00:34:59,263 --> 00:35:00,681
The Xindi.

476
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:03,601
Captain?

477
00:35:03,684 --> 00:35:05,812
Everything's under control, Lieutenant.

478
00:35:05,895 --> 00:35:07,522
The airlock's decompressing, sir.

479
00:35:07,605 --> 00:35:10,650
-( gasping )
-He'll die.

480
00:35:10,733 --> 00:35:13,319
Not for another 20 seconds, he won't.

481
00:35:13,903 --> 00:35:15,071
The Xindi.

482
00:35:18,699 --> 00:35:20,910
-Sir?
-Your memory getting any better?

483
00:35:20,993 --> 00:35:23,788
-( gasping )
-Say again?

484
00:35:25,414 --> 00:35:26,666
Captain.

485
00:35:28,918 --> 00:35:31,921
-( beeping )
-( gasping )

486
00:35:35,174 --> 00:35:36,968
Take him back to the brig.

487
00:35:38,678 --> 00:35:39,971
Let's go.

488
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:50,356
Was he cooperative?

489
00:35:51,607 --> 00:35:52,900
Eventually.

490
00:35:53,985 --> 00:35:55,611
When they attacked the Xindi ship,

491
00:35:55,695 --> 00:35:57,822
they took more than fuel and supplies.

492
00:35:57,905 --> 00:36:00,116
They downloaded their database.

493
00:36:00,741 --> 00:36:03,828
How close would we have to get
to tap into their main computer?

494
00:36:03,911 --> 00:36:06,247
Pretty close. Less than a kilometer.

495
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:07,999
But we need to have the access codes.

496
00:36:08,082 --> 00:36:10,418
He gave them to me. Here.

497
00:36:11,043 --> 00:36:12,712
They are heavily armed.

498
00:36:12,795 --> 00:36:14,547
Are you sure it's wise to engage them?

499
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:17,175
I want that database.
Go to tactical alert.

500
00:36:17,258 --> 00:36:19,343
Tell Trip we're gonna need
all the power he can spare

501
00:36:19,427 --> 00:36:21,053
for weapons and hull plating.

502
00:36:21,137 --> 00:36:23,055
Their ion trail's
already started to decay.

503
00:36:23,139 --> 00:36:24,932
They're going to be hard to find.

504
00:36:26,893 --> 00:36:29,103
We're gonna wait for them to find us,
Travis.

505
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:42,033
( beeping )

506
00:36:42,617 --> 00:36:44,660
Something's passing
through the cloaking field.

507
00:36:44,744 --> 00:36:47,622
Move us into position. Stand by.

508
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:52,877
Have they detected us?

509
00:36:53,211 --> 00:36:54,420
Not yet.

510
00:37:08,184 --> 00:37:09,685
Open a channel.

511
00:37:09,769 --> 00:37:11,354
-( beeps )
-Go ahead.

512
00:37:11,437 --> 00:37:14,023
This is Captain Archer. Remember us?

513
00:37:14,482 --> 00:37:17,026
You've probably noticed that
our weapons are back online.

514
00:37:17,109 --> 00:37:19,654
You're out-gunned. So stand down.

515
00:37:19,737 --> 00:37:21,280
( explosion )

516
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:23,908
They're moving off.

517
00:37:23,991 --> 00:37:26,911
One kilometer, Travis. Get ready.

518
00:37:27,578 --> 00:37:29,830
-( explosion )
-Hull plating's holding.

519
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:31,832
They're heading back
into the cloaking field.

520
00:37:32,625 --> 00:37:33,668
Stay with them.

521
00:37:47,139 --> 00:37:47,974
Hoshi?

522
00:37:48,057 --> 00:37:49,350
We're not close enough.

523
00:37:49,433 --> 00:37:50,768
Stand by.

524
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:53,604
Another 50 meters.

525
00:37:56,190 --> 00:37:57,608
I'm into the computer.

526
00:38:00,653 --> 00:38:02,697
( beeping )

527
00:38:03,281 --> 00:38:04,365
Anything?

528
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:06,450
I haven't found the Xindi database.

529
00:38:07,451 --> 00:38:08,536
( rumbling )

530
00:38:10,705 --> 00:38:11,998
I'm losing them.

531
00:38:12,081 --> 00:38:13,082
Travis!

532
00:38:21,090 --> 00:38:22,925
Forward hull plating is off-line.

533
00:38:23,592 --> 00:38:24,802
I found it, Captain.

534
00:38:24,885 --> 00:38:26,721
-How long do you need?
-A few minutes.

535
00:38:29,473 --> 00:38:31,559
Hull fracture on "E" deck, section 14.

536
00:38:31,642 --> 00:38:33,144
We're venting atmosphere.

537
00:38:33,227 --> 00:38:35,021
Emergency bulkheads.

538
00:38:36,105 --> 00:38:38,816
They're getting too far away.
I'm losing the com link again.

539
00:38:38,899 --> 00:38:41,319
Our impulse drive's destabilizing.

540
00:38:41,402 --> 00:38:43,988
We've got to get out
of the cloaking field, sir.

541
00:38:46,991 --> 00:38:48,326
Head back to the sphere.

542
00:38:55,916 --> 00:38:58,419
-Where are they?
-Still inside the field.

543
00:38:58,502 --> 00:39:00,504
How much did you get?

544
00:39:00,588 --> 00:39:02,423
About a third of it.

545
00:39:03,132 --> 00:39:04,675
Take us closer to that portal.

546
00:39:05,343 --> 00:39:07,845
Let's see if we can
lure them back in here.

547
00:39:07,928 --> 00:39:09,722
Use our forward phase cannon.

548
00:39:09,805 --> 00:39:11,724
Fire a single burst, minimum yield.

549
00:39:16,354 --> 00:39:18,564
-Travis?
-No sign of them.

550
00:39:20,524 --> 00:39:21,442
Again.

551
00:39:28,532 --> 00:39:29,909
That got their attention.

552
00:39:30,493 --> 00:39:32,036
They're coming through.

553
00:39:42,463 --> 00:39:45,591
Stay within a kilometer. Return fire.

554
00:39:46,133 --> 00:39:47,510
I'm back in.

555
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:51,430
Can you take out their engines?

556
00:39:51,514 --> 00:39:53,391
Not without risking damage
to their main computer.

557
00:39:55,726 --> 00:39:57,103
Ensign.

558
00:39:57,186 --> 00:39:58,354
I've got 80%.

559
00:39:58,938 --> 00:40:00,022
85%.

560
00:40:03,442 --> 00:40:06,070
Hull plating's off-line.
They're targeting our reactor.

561
00:40:06,654 --> 00:40:07,738
I've got 90%.

562
00:40:07,822 --> 00:40:09,407
Good enough. Mr. Reed.

563
00:40:21,627 --> 00:40:23,045
Their engines are down.

564
00:40:23,671 --> 00:40:25,631
Keep our weapons locked on them.

565
00:40:40,229 --> 00:40:41,564
Your codes worked.

566
00:40:42,356 --> 00:40:43,983
Get him out of there.

567
00:40:49,113 --> 00:40:52,074
Now that I've served my purpose,
you're taking me back to the airlock?

568
00:40:52,616 --> 00:40:54,535
Escort him to the launch bay.

569
00:40:58,664 --> 00:41:00,916
We're taking you back to the sphere.

570
00:41:02,877 --> 00:41:06,088
So you have let your morality
get in the way after all.

571
00:41:07,673 --> 00:41:09,341
( chuckles )

572
00:41:10,134 --> 00:41:12,636
Mercy is not a quality
that will serve you well

573
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,847
in the expanse, Captain.

574
00:41:33,574 --> 00:41:35,326
-Computer...
-( beeps )

575
00:41:37,661 --> 00:41:39,288
Load the Xindi database.

576
00:41:39,371 --> 00:41:40,664
( beeping )
