00:33:09,237 --> 00:33:12,574
I'M GETTING A SIGNAL
FROM ONE OF OUR SENTRY PROBES.

520
00:33:12,574 --> 00:33:14,868
SIX XINDI SHIPS
HAVE ENTERED THE SYSTEM.

522
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:30,258
IS EVERYONE IN POSITION?

523
00:33:31,593 --> 00:33:33,386
AYE, SIR.

524
00:33:33,386 --> 00:33:34,805
THE XINDI SHIPS ARE IN RANGE.

525
00:33:34,805 --> 00:33:35,973
FIRE!

526
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:42,312
OUR SHIELDS ARE HOLDING.

527
00:33:42,312 --> 00:33:43,981
NICE TO KNOW
THEY WORK IN COMBAT.

528
00:33:43,981 --> 00:33:46,566
REMIND ME TO SEND A THANK-YOU
NOTE TO GENERAL SHRAN.

TWO OF THEIR SHIPS
ARE BREAKING OFF.

532
00:33:55,325 --> 00:33:56,451
THEY'RE FOLLOWING US.

533
00:33:56,451 --> 00:33:57,619
WHAT ABOUT THE OTHERS?

00:33:57,619 --> 00:33:59,412

-TARGET THE SECOND ONE.

00:34:19,808 --> 00:34:22,185
THEIR ENGINE'S DISABLED.

538
00:34:22,185 --> 00:34:24,270
THE OTHER XINDI SHIPS
HAVE CHANGED THEIR HEADING.

539
00:34:28,984 --> 00:34:30,610
I THINK WE'RE GONNA FIND OUT
HOW MUCH OF A BEATING

00:34:40,037 --> 00:34:41,955
JONATHAN, YOU NEED TO REST.

544
00:34:43,498 --> 00:34:45,333
-WHERE ARE YOU GOING?
-TO THE BRIDGE.

545
00:34:45,333 --> 00:34:46,793
I'M NOT GONNA JUST LIE HERE

546
00:34:46,793 --> 00:34:48,962
WHILE THEY DESTROY
WHAT'S LEFT OF HUMANITY.

547
00:34:50,714 --> 00:34:52,298
YOU SHOULD REMAIN HERE.

565
00:36:30,939 --> 00:36:32,983
WE DON'T HAVE TIME TO WORRY
ABOUT PARASITES RIGHT NOW.

566
00:36:32,983 --> 00:36:35,276
THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY TRUE.

I'LL EXPLAIN.

568
00:36:55,755 --> 00:36:58,424
I'M SORRY, CAPTAIN,
THE CHAMBER'S BEEN DAMAGED.

569
00:37:01,803 --> 00:37:03,805
DIDN'T YOU SAY WE COULD
DESTROY THE PARASITES

570
00:37:03,805 --> 00:37:05,223
WITH A SUBSPACE IMPLOSION?

571
00:37:05,223 --> 00:37:07,642
-YES, BUT THAT WOULD --
-CAN WE CREATE ONE?

572
00:37:07,642 --> 00:37:10,228
WE WOULD HAVE TO OVERLOAD
THREE PLASMA INJECTORS.

573
00:37:10,228 --> 00:37:12,105
THAT WOULD SEND A FEEDBACK PULSE
THROUGH THE REACTOR.

574
00:37:12,105 --> 00:37:13,690
YOU'LL DESTROY THE SHIP!

575
00:37:13,690 --> 00:37:16,317
AT THIS POINT, IT WON'T MAKE
MUCH OF A DIFFERENCE.

THEY'RE ONLY AFTER HUMANS.
