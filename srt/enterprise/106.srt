THE EARLY 20th CENTURY.

682
00:42:27,045 --> 00:42:29,172
HOW ABOUT AMELIA EARHART?

683
00:42:29,214 --> 00:42:30,631
T'POL: NO.

684
00:42:30,673 --> 00:42:32,591
1937.

685
00:42:32,633 --> 00:42:35,261
NEVER FOUND A TRACE OF HER.

686
00:42:35,303 --> 00:42:37,389
A LOT OF PEOPLE
SPENT YEARS -- DECADES --

687
00:42:37,430 --> 00:42:40,475
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT
WHAT HAPPENED TO THEM.

688
00:42:40,517 --> 00:42:41,684
BUT NEITHER
OF THOSE MYSTERIES

689
00:42:41,726 --> 00:42:44,812
HOLDS A CANDLE
TO TERRA NOVA.

690
00:42:44,854 --> 00:42:46,105
AND WE SOLVED IT.

691
00:42:46,147 --> 00:42:47,690
DID MORE THAN THAT.

692
00:42:47,732 --> 00:42:50,109
THOSE PEOPLE WERE A YEAR OR TWO
AWAY FROM EXTINCTION.

693
00:42:50,151 --> 00:42:53,863
WE DIDN'T JUST FIND THEM.
WE SAVED THEIR LIVES.

694
00:42:53,905 --> 00:42:58,659
ALL THESE YEARS WONDERING
ABOUT THAT COLONY.

695
00:42:58,701 --> 00:43:00,953
I NEVER THOUGHT I'D BECOME
A PART OF THEIR HISTORY.

696
00:43:03,248 --> 00:43:05,250
TELL YOU WHAT, TRAVIS.

697
00:43:05,291 --> 00:43:07,919
WHY DON'T YOU PUT TOGETHER
THE REPORT FOR STARFLEET?

698
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:09,087
IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN,

699
00:43:09,128 --> 00:43:11,672
IT'LL BE HEADLINE NEWS
BACK HOME.

700
00:43:11,714 --> 00:43:14,633
TUCKER: THE TERRA NOVA PUZZLE
SOLVED AT LAST,

701
00:43:14,675 --> 00:43:17,929
AS TOLD
BY ENSIGN TRAVIS MAYWEATHER.
