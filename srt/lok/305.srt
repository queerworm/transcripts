1
00:00:01,419 --> 00:00:03,004
- Tenzin: EARTH.

2
00:00:03,087 --> 00:00:04,672
FIRE.

3
00:00:04,839 --> 00:00:06,424
AIR.

4
00:00:06,591 --> 00:00:08,593
WATER.

5
00:00:08,968 --> 00:00:12,430
ONLY THE AVATAR CAN MASTER
ALL FOUR ELEMENTS

6
00:00:12,597 --> 00:00:15,725
AND BRING BALANCE
TO THE WORLD.

7
00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:23,358
IS THERE ANY PLACE SAFE
FOR THE AVATAR?

8
00:00:23,566 --> 00:00:26,319
FIRST, PRESIDENT RAIKO
BANISHED HER FROM REPUBLIC CITY.

9
00:00:26,402 --> 00:00:28,488
THEN THE EARTH QUEEN DECLARED
HER AN ENEMY OF THE KINGDOM

10
00:00:28,571 --> 00:00:31,533
AFTER KORRA RESCUED A GROUP
OF AIRBENDERS FROM BA SING SE.

11
00:00:31,616 --> 00:00:33,368
AND NOW KORRA
HAS LEARNED THAT ZAHEER

12
00:00:33,451 --> 00:00:35,036
AND HIS FELLOW CRIMINALS
ARE AFTER HER.

13
00:00:35,119 --> 00:00:37,163
WITH TENZIN BUSY BRINGING
THE NEW RECRUITS

14
00:00:37,247 --> 00:00:38,248
TO THE NORTHERN AIR TEMPLE,

15
00:00:38,331 --> 00:00:40,959
KORRA'S PROTECTION NOW RESTS
IN BEIFONG'S HANDS.

16
00:00:58,810 --> 00:01:00,061
- WHILE YOU'RE PLAYING FETCH,

17
00:01:00,144 --> 00:01:02,063
FOUR OF THE MOST DANGEROUS
CRIMINALS IN THE WORLD

18
00:01:02,146 --> 00:01:04,232
ARE HUNTING YOU DOWN.
WE SHOULD GET MOVING.

19
00:01:04,315 --> 00:01:05,900
RELAX.
WE JUST GOT HERE.

20
00:01:05,984 --> 00:01:09,112
BESIDES, NO ONE KNOWS
WHERE I AM RIGHT NOW EXCEPT US.

21
00:01:11,781 --> 00:01:14,158
I THINK SHE WANTS YOU
TO THROW IT FOR HER.

22
00:01:16,494 --> 00:01:18,121
I'LL PASS.
THANKS.

23
00:01:18,329 --> 00:01:20,665
WE JUST GOT A CALL ON THE
RADIO ABOUT ANOTHER AIRBENDER.

24
00:01:20,748 --> 00:01:22,250
FINALLY.
WHERE ARE THEY?

25
00:01:22,333 --> 00:01:24,794
A CITY CALLED ZAOFU,
THE HOME OF THE METAL CLAN.

26
00:01:25,336 --> 00:01:26,337
- YOU KNOW THE PLACE?

27
00:01:26,462 --> 00:01:29,424
UH, NEVER BEEN, BUT
I DON'T WANT YOU GOING THERE.

28
00:01:29,507 --> 00:01:32,635
I'D REST A LOT EASIER
IF YOU WERE BACK SAFE IN REPUBLIC CITY.

29
00:01:32,802 --> 00:01:35,096
SORRY, BUT IF THERE'S
AN AIRBENDER IN ZAOFU,

30
00:01:35,179 --> 00:01:37,056
THEN THAT'S WHERE
WE'RE GOING NEXT.

31
00:01:55,533 --> 00:01:57,118
Bclin: WOW, WOW, WOW!

32
00:01:57,201 --> 00:01:59,829
AN ENTIRE CITY MADE OF METAL,
WHOO!

33
00:01:59,912 --> 00:02:01,706
YOU SHOULD BE
RIGHT AT HOME, BEIFONG.

34
00:02:02,206 --> 00:02:04,375
HMM.

35
00:02:23,645 --> 00:02:25,980
- YEAH!

36
00:02:26,981 --> 00:02:29,067
- AREN'T YOU COMING?
- WHAT'S THERE TO SEE?

37
00:02:29,275 --> 00:02:30,860
IT'S METAL.
BIG WHOOP.

38
00:02:30,985 --> 00:02:32,945
JUST FIND THE AIRBENDER,
AND LET'S GET MOVING.

39
00:02:33,071 --> 00:02:34,781
AND DON'T TELL ANYONE
I'M HERE.

40
00:02:34,864 --> 00:02:36,032
- WHY NOT?

41
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,909
I DON'T NEED
TO EXPLAIN MYSELF TO YOU.

42
00:02:37,992 --> 00:02:39,452
JUST DO WHAT I SAY.

43
00:02:39,535 --> 00:02:42,205
FINE.
YOU GOT IT, CHIEF CRANKY PANTS.

44
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:51,089
AVATAR KORRA,
IT IS AN HONOR TO MEET YOU.

45
00:02:51,172 --> 00:02:53,007
MY NAME IS AIWEI.

46
00:02:53,091 --> 00:02:55,968
- THANKS FOR HAVING US.
- IS THIS EVERYONE?

47
00:02:56,094 --> 00:03:00,014
YEP, JUST US.
SO CAN I MEET THE NEW AIRBENDER?

48
00:03:00,098 --> 00:03:02,517
OF COURSE.
RIGHT THIS WAY.

49
00:03:16,322 --> 00:03:17,865
AND THIS IS
THE AIR ACOLYTE DINING HALL,

50
00:03:17,949 --> 00:03:20,034
WHERE EVERYONE EATS,
AND THIS IS DAW.

51
00:03:20,326 --> 00:03:22,662
HE'S A NEW AIRBENDER TOO,
LIKE YOU GUYS.

52
00:03:22,787 --> 00:03:24,539
IT'S SO NICE TO MEET YOU.

53
00:03:24,622 --> 00:03:26,624
HOW EXCITING.
NEW FRIENDS.

54
00:03:26,749 --> 00:03:28,376
- EXCUSE ME, HELLO?

55
00:03:28,459 --> 00:03:30,086
MY NAME IS YORRU.

56
00:03:30,169 --> 00:03:32,755
I HEARD THIS WAS THE PLACE TO
COME IF YOU'RE A NEW AIRBENDER.

57
00:03:32,964 --> 00:03:35,299
YOU GOT THAT RIGHT,
STRANGER.

58
00:03:35,383 --> 00:03:36,718
- WELL, A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO,

59
00:03:36,801 --> 00:03:39,262
I WOKE UP, AND SUDDENLY,
I COULD DO THIS.

60
00:03:41,806 --> 00:03:44,767
MOM, AUNT KYA,
WE GOT ANOTHER ONE!

61
00:04:05,246 --> 00:04:07,957
THAT STATUE HONORS
THE FIRST METALBENDER,

62
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:10,501
TOPH BEIFONG,
WHO EXPANDED

63
00:04:10,585 --> 00:04:13,546
THE POSSIBILITIES
OF WHAT BENDERS WERE CAPABLE OF.

64
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:16,174
HERE, EVERYONE IS ENCOURAGED

65
00:04:16,257 --> 00:04:19,135
TO REACH
HIS OR HER HIGHEST POTENTIAL.

66
00:04:19,927 --> 00:04:21,429
- DOES TOPH LIVE HERE?

67
00:04:21,512 --> 00:04:24,432
ARE WE GOING TO GET TO MEET HER?
- I'M AFRAID NOT.

68
00:04:24,515 --> 00:04:26,642
SHE USED TO VISIT
FROM TIME TO TIME,

69
00:04:26,726 --> 00:04:29,353
BUT YEARS AGO,
SHE LEFT TO WANDER THE WORLD

70
00:04:29,437 --> 00:04:31,063
IN SEARCH OF ENLIGHTENMENT.

71
00:04:31,647 --> 00:04:34,150
NO ONE HAS SEEN HER SINCE.

72
00:04:51,042 --> 00:04:53,544
Korra: WOW, IS THIS
WHERE THE AIRBENDER LIVES?

73
00:04:53,628 --> 00:04:57,089
YES, BUT FIRST,
HER MOTHER WANTS TO MEET YOU.

74
00:05:09,227 --> 00:05:11,437
IS THIS SOME KIND
OF COMBAT TRAINING?

75
00:05:11,562 --> 00:05:12,814
- NOT EXACTLY.

76
00:05:12,897 --> 00:05:16,067
THEY ARE REHEARSING
FOR A DANCE PREMIERE NEXT MONTH.

77
00:05:25,201 --> 00:05:27,119
THAT'S IT FOR TODAY,
EVERYONE.

78
00:05:28,496 --> 00:05:29,705
- ALLOW ME TO INTRODUCE

79
00:05:29,789 --> 00:05:32,542
THE MATRIARCH
OF THE METAL CLAN, SUYIN.

80
00:05:32,625 --> 00:05:34,210
- PLEASE, CALL ME SU.

81
00:05:34,502 --> 00:05:36,546
GREAT TO FINALLY MEET YOU,
AVATAR KORRA.

82
00:05:37,463 --> 00:05:39,757
AND THIS MUST BE
MAKO, BOLIN, AND ASAMI.

83
00:05:39,841 --> 00:05:41,217
- YOU'VE DONE YOUR RESEARCH.

84
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:44,011
I MAKE IT MY BUSINESS
TO KNOW WHO'S VISITING MY CITY.

85
00:05:44,095 --> 00:05:45,388
- SO YOU'RE A DANCER?

86
00:05:45,638 --> 00:05:47,890
DANCER, LEADER,
WIFE, MOTHER,

87
00:05:48,015 --> 00:05:49,767
COLLECTOR OF RARE METEORITES.

88
00:05:49,892 --> 00:05:52,854
YOU'LL FIND PEOPLE HERE
HAVE MANY SKILLS AND INTERESTS.

89
00:05:55,565 --> 00:05:57,024
- KORRA, WHY DID YOU LIE

90
00:05:57,108 --> 00:05:59,235
WHEN AIWEI ASKED IF THERE WAS
ANYONE ELSE WITH YOU?

91
00:05:59,318 --> 00:06:01,279
WHAT?
I-I DIDN'T.

92
00:06:01,362 --> 00:06:03,030
I MEAN...

93
00:06:03,114 --> 00:06:04,282
HOW DID YOU KNOW
I WAS LYING?

94
00:06:04,407 --> 00:06:06,033
- I AM A TRUTH SEER.

95
00:06:06,117 --> 00:06:07,285
WHEN PEOPLE LIE,

96
00:06:07,368 --> 00:06:10,162
THEIR HEART RATE
AND BREATHING INCREASE.

97
00:06:10,329 --> 00:06:13,624
I CAN SENSE
THE MOST SUBTLE OF CHANGES.

98
00:06:13,708 --> 00:06:17,211
Suyin: THANKS TO AIWEI,
THERE ARE NO SECRETS IN OUR CITY.

99
00:06:17,295 --> 00:06:20,006
WE CAME WITH
REPUBLIC CITY'S CHIEF OF POLICE.

100
00:06:20,089 --> 00:06:22,174
SHE DIDN'T WANT ANYONE
TO KNOW SHE WAS HERE.

101
00:06:22,508 --> 00:06:23,968
I'M SORRY I DIDN'T TELL YOU.

102
00:06:24,051 --> 00:06:27,388
LIN'S HERE?
WELL, I WOULD LOVE TO SAY HELLO.

103
00:06:27,638 --> 00:06:29,307
WAIT, YOU TWO
KNOW EACH OTHER?

104
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:31,767
- YOU'RE JOKING, RIGHT?

105
00:06:32,643 --> 00:06:35,313
OH, LIN NEVER TOLD YOU
ABOUT ME.

106
00:06:35,438 --> 00:06:37,148
NO.
WHY WOULD SHE?

107
00:06:37,273 --> 00:06:39,066
- I'M LIN'S SISTER.

108
00:06:44,363 --> 00:06:46,574
Korra: I FOUND OUT
WHY YOU WERE SO AGAINST COMING HERE.

109
00:06:46,657 --> 00:06:48,409
WHY DIDN'T YOU EVER TELL ME
YOU HAD A SISTER?

110
00:06:48,492 --> 00:06:49,827
- HALF-SISTER.

111
00:06:49,911 --> 00:06:51,621
- SAME MOM, DIFFERENT DADS.

112
00:06:51,704 --> 00:06:53,331
SO WHAT?
WE'RE BLOOD, LIN.

113
00:06:53,414 --> 00:06:56,918
AND AFTER 30 YEARS, THE LEAST
YOU COULD DO IS SAY HELLO.

114
00:06:57,001 --> 00:06:59,545
I HAVE NOTHING
TO SAY TO YOU.

115
00:07:04,383 --> 00:07:07,595
Korra: YOU TWO HAVEN'T SPOKEN
IN 30 YEARS...HOW COME?

116
00:07:07,678 --> 00:07:09,639
ASK HER.
I'VE TRIED.

117
00:07:09,722 --> 00:07:11,140
- OH, DON'T PUT THAT ON ME.

118
00:07:11,223 --> 00:07:12,934
YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO TORE OUR FAMILY APART.

119
00:07:13,017 --> 00:07:15,686
AND YOU'VE DONE
A BANG-UP JOB KEEPING IT THAT WAY.

120
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:17,939
YOU HAVEN'T CHANGED ONE BIT,
HAVE YOU?

121
00:07:18,022 --> 00:07:20,483
LOOK, WE CAN STAND HERE
ARGUING ABOUT THE PAST ALL DAY,

122
00:07:20,566 --> 00:07:22,610
BUT THAT'S NOT THE REASON
THE AVATAR CAME HERE.

123
00:07:23,152 --> 00:07:25,363
MY DAUGHTER IS THRILLED
TO MEET YOU.

124
00:07:25,529 --> 00:07:28,199
LIN, YOUR NIECE
IS THE NEW AIRBENDER.

125
00:07:28,282 --> 00:07:29,742
ISN'T THAT AMAZING?

126
00:07:30,201 --> 00:07:31,869
- YEAH. TERRIFIC.

127
00:07:33,704 --> 00:07:36,290
THOSE ARE MY TWO YOUNGEST,
WEI AND WING.

128
00:07:36,374 --> 00:07:38,084
THEY'RE PLAYING A GAME CALLED
POWER DISK.

129
00:07:38,209 --> 00:07:40,211
THEY INVENTED IT
ALL ON THEIR OWN.

130
00:07:40,836 --> 00:07:42,672
YAH!

131
00:07:47,051 --> 00:07:48,719
- OH, NICE POWER, WEI.

132
00:07:50,054 --> 00:07:51,597
HA!
WING GOES DOWN.

133
00:07:51,681 --> 00:07:53,641
- I'M SO PROUD OF THOSE TWO.

134
00:08:10,783 --> 00:08:13,577
HUAN, I WANT YOU TO MEET
THE AVATAR AND HER FRIENDS

135
00:08:13,661 --> 00:08:14,912
AND YOUR AUNT LIN.

136
00:08:14,996 --> 00:08:17,456
- NICE TO MEET YOU.
- HEY.

137
00:08:18,082 --> 00:08:21,627
WOW,
THAT'S A REALLY NICE...BANANA?

138
00:08:21,711 --> 00:08:23,587
YES, VERY, VERY LIFELIKE.

139
00:08:24,171 --> 00:08:26,799
IT'S NOT A BANANA!

140
00:08:26,882 --> 00:08:28,884
I WAS INSPIRED
BY HARMONIC CONVERGENCE.

141
00:08:28,968 --> 00:08:32,763
IT REPRESENTS THE DAWNING
OF A NEW AGE, OBVIOUSLY.

142
00:08:32,847 --> 00:08:35,349
OH, YEAH, NO, I C...
I CAN TOTALLY SEE THAT.

143
00:08:35,433 --> 00:08:37,768
I...WAIT, LET ME STAND HERE.
YES, I CAN SEE THAT NOW.

144
00:08:37,852 --> 00:08:38,978
YES. THANK YOU.

145
00:08:39,061 --> 00:08:41,605
BANANA.
I MEAN, THAT'S A BANANA, RIGHT?

146
00:08:45,359 --> 00:08:47,570
AND THIS IS
MY DAUGHTER OPAL.

147
00:08:48,404 --> 00:08:50,031
- WOW, AVATAR KORRA.

148
00:08:50,156 --> 00:08:51,741
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU'RE REALLY HERE.

149
00:08:51,824 --> 00:08:53,367
YOU ARE SO AMAZING.

150
00:08:53,451 --> 00:08:55,119
IT'S GREAT
TO MEET YOU, OPAL.

151
00:08:55,202 --> 00:08:57,288
OPAL?
THAT'S A BEAUTIFUL NAME.

152
00:08:57,371 --> 00:08:59,498
- THANKS.
- I'M BOLIN.

153
00:08:59,623 --> 00:09:02,626
OPAL, BUT, UH,
YOU ALREADY KNEW THAT.

154
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:07,339
GREAT.
WE FOUND THE AIRBENDER.

155
00:09:07,423 --> 00:09:09,258
LET'S TAKE HER BACK TO THE
AIRSHIP AND GET OUT OF HERE.

156
00:09:09,341 --> 00:09:11,719
AND THE WOMAN APPARENTLY
TRYING TO ABDUCT YOU

157
00:09:11,802 --> 00:09:12,970
IS YOUR AUNT LIN.

158
00:09:13,054 --> 00:09:15,514
REALLY?
I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO MEET YOU.

159
00:09:15,598 --> 00:09:18,184
MY MOM HAS TOLD ME
SO MANY STORIES ABOUT YOU.

160
00:09:18,267 --> 00:09:19,769
- I'M SURE SHE HAS.

161
00:09:19,852 --> 00:09:21,979
SO I'VE SET ALL OF YOU UP
IN THE GUESTHOUSES

162
00:09:22,063 --> 00:09:23,230
WHILE KORRA TRAINS OPAL.

163
00:09:23,314 --> 00:09:25,191
OH, I'M SORRY,
BUT I WAS HOPING

164
00:09:25,274 --> 00:09:27,068
SHE COULD TRAIN
WITH THE REST OF THE AIRBENDERS

165
00:09:27,151 --> 00:09:28,235
AT THE NORTHERN TEMPLE.

166
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:30,404
- THAT SOUNDS AMAZING.
- NONSENSE.

167
00:09:30,488 --> 00:09:32,198
THIS IS WHERE OPAL'S HOME
AND FAMILY ARE.

168
00:09:32,281 --> 00:09:33,449
YOU CAN TRAIN HER HERE.

169
00:09:33,532 --> 00:09:35,201
I GUESS
I COULD HELP HER GET STARTED.

170
00:09:35,326 --> 00:09:37,244
ABSOLUTELY NOT.
WE'RE LEAVING.

171
00:09:37,328 --> 00:09:38,579
- SHE'S JUST A LITTLE WORRIED

172
00:09:38,662 --> 00:09:41,082
BECAUSE THERE ARE A BUNCH
OF CRAZY CRIMINALS AFTER ME.

173
00:09:41,165 --> 00:09:43,250
IF YOU'RE CONCERNED
ABOUT SECURITY, DON'T BE.

174
00:09:43,334 --> 00:09:45,419
THIS IS THE SAFEST CITY
IN THE WORLD.

175
00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:48,130
NOW, I'LL SEE YOU
ALL AT DINNER, AND COME HUNGRY.

176
00:09:48,214 --> 00:09:50,841
MY CHEF WILL BLOW THE TASTE
BUDS RIGHT OUT OF YOUR MOUTH.

177
00:09:53,385 --> 00:09:55,262
WHY DO YOU HAVE
SUCH A PROBLEM WITH YOUR SISTER?

178
00:09:55,346 --> 00:09:56,847
SHE SEEMS NICE.

179
00:09:57,348 --> 00:09:59,350
COME ON,
WE CAN STAY A LITTLE WHILE.

180
00:10:03,729 --> 00:10:05,564
Korra: OKAY, LET'S SEE
WHAT YOU GOT.

181
00:10:05,648 --> 00:10:08,234
- I'M NOT VERY GOOD.
- THAT'S OKAY.

182
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,069
I'VE NEVER BEEN
A TEACHER BEFORE,

183
00:10:10,152 --> 00:10:11,904
SO WE'RE IN THE SAME BOAT.

184
00:10:12,363 --> 00:10:13,823
YOU WANT
TO KEEP YOUR ELBOWS IN,

185
00:10:13,948 --> 00:10:17,576
TORSO STRAIGHT,
FEET JUST SKIMMING THE GROUND.

186
00:10:18,911 --> 00:10:20,663
WHY DON'T YOU
TRY IT WITH ME?

187
00:10:37,138 --> 00:10:39,056
WOW,
YOU'RE A NATURAL.

188
00:10:39,431 --> 00:10:40,808
- YOU REALLY THINK SO?

189
00:10:40,891 --> 00:10:42,601
THANKS.

190
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:55,239
YOU CALL YOURSELF
AN AIRBENDER?

191
00:10:55,531 --> 00:10:57,241
DISGRACEFUL!

192
00:11:03,372 --> 00:11:04,999
- BE THE LEAF!

193
00:11:05,082 --> 00:11:07,877
BUT I DON'T KNOW
WHAT THAT MEANS!

194
00:11:22,641 --> 00:11:24,602
- NOW THAT MAN'S A LEAF.

195
00:11:24,685 --> 00:11:27,813
THE STUDENT IS
ONLY AS GOOD AS HIS MASTER.

196
00:11:30,107 --> 00:11:31,192
- GREAT NEWS.

197
00:11:31,275 --> 00:11:32,693
I JUST GOT A MESSAGE
FROM TENZIN.

198
00:11:32,776 --> 00:11:34,361
HE'S WITH A WHOLE GROUP
OF OTHER AIRBENDERS

199
00:11:34,445 --> 00:11:36,822
AT THE NORTHERN TEMPLE, AND HE
WANTS ALL OF YOU TO JOIN THEM.

200
00:11:36,989 --> 00:11:38,449
WE LEAVE FIRST THING
IN THE MORNING.

201
00:11:38,532 --> 00:11:40,284
- AND THE AVATAR IS WITH THEM?

202
00:11:40,993 --> 00:11:43,954
NO, APPARENTLY SHE HAD
TO SPLIT OFF FROM TENZIN.

203
00:11:44,413 --> 00:11:46,081
- THAT'S UNFORTUNATE.

204
00:11:46,207 --> 00:11:49,293
I WAS REALLY LOOKING FORWARD
TO MEETING HER.

205
00:11:58,469 --> 00:12:00,346
TONIGHT,
FOR YOUR DINING PLEASURE,

206
00:12:00,471 --> 00:12:03,557
I PRESENT A SEARED WILD KYOSHI
ELEPHANT KOI,

207
00:12:03,641 --> 00:12:06,477
PAIRED WITH A GINGER-INFUSED
PEA TENDRIL

208
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,938
AND HIBISCUS ROOT SALAD.

209
00:12:09,146 --> 00:12:11,190
- STUNNING.

210
00:12:14,318 --> 00:12:17,029
SORRY, DEAR, I'M GOING TO HAVE
TO TAKE DINNER IN MY OFFICE.

211
00:12:17,112 --> 00:12:20,199
I JUST HAD A MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH
ON THE TRAM STATION REMODEL.

212
00:12:20,324 --> 00:12:22,910
WELL, DON'T LET ME
STAND IN THE WAY OF INSPIRATION.

213
00:12:22,993 --> 00:12:24,453
- YOU'RE THE BEST.

214
00:12:24,536 --> 00:12:26,914
THAT WAS MY BRILLIANT
ARCHITECT OF A HUSBAND, BAATAR,

215
00:12:26,997 --> 00:12:28,207
AND OUR OLDEST SON.

216
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:30,501
HE ENGINEERS
ALL MY HUSBAND'S PROJECTS.

217
00:12:30,626 --> 00:12:32,544
FIVE KIDS.
WHAT A NIGHTMARE.

218
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:34,797
NO, NO,
MY CHILDREN ARE A BLESSING.

219
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,215
YEAH,
MOM USED TO SAY THAT TOO,

220
00:12:36,298 --> 00:12:37,758
BUT SHE NEVER MEANT IT.

221
00:12:39,969 --> 00:12:41,262
- MMM.

222
00:12:41,345 --> 00:12:43,138
I HAVE TO ADMIT,
I WAS PRETTY SKEPTICAL

223
00:12:43,222 --> 00:12:45,307
WHEN HE SAID "PEA TENDRIL..."

224
00:12:45,516 --> 00:12:46,767
BUT THIS IS DELICIOUS!

225
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:48,811
I KNOW, RIGHT?

226
00:12:48,894 --> 00:12:51,272
I DON'T THINK I'VE EVER HAD
A BAD MEAL IN MY LIFE.

227
00:12:51,355 --> 00:12:52,690
- OH, I HAD PLENTY

228
00:12:52,773 --> 00:12:54,358
WHEN MAKO AND I
WERE LIVING ON THE STREETS.

229
00:12:54,525 --> 00:12:58,362
I MEAN, YOU'D BE SURPRISED
HOW BAD FOOD FROM A DUMPSTER CAN BE.

230
00:12:58,445 --> 00:13:00,281
I'M SORRY.
I DIDN'T KNOW.

231
00:13:00,364 --> 00:13:02,157
NO, IT'S OKAY, IT'S OKAY.
THAT'S ALL IN THE PAST.

232
00:13:02,241 --> 00:13:03,450
THINGS ARE GREAT NOW.

233
00:13:03,534 --> 00:13:04,660
I GOT TO BE A PRO BENDER,

234
00:13:04,868 --> 00:13:06,578
FOUGHT AGAINST
A DANGEROUS REVOLUTION,

235
00:13:06,704 --> 00:13:08,747
BECAME A MOVER STAR,

236
00:13:08,831 --> 00:13:11,792
AND NOW I'M HELPING THE AVATAR
REBUILD A WHOLE NATION.

237
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:15,379
WOW, YOUR LIFE
SOUNDS SO EXCITING.

238
00:13:15,462 --> 00:13:17,506
HOW'S YOUR SEARCH
FOR THE NEW AIRBENDERS GOING?

239
00:13:17,589 --> 00:13:19,675
- HONESTLY, NOT GREAT.

240
00:13:19,758 --> 00:13:22,386
WE HAD TO RESCUE A WHOLE GROUP
OF THEM FROM THE EARTH QUEEN.

241
00:13:22,511 --> 00:13:23,637
- OH, SHE'S HORRIBLE.

242
00:13:23,721 --> 00:13:25,889
SHE THINKS SHE CAN
JUST DO WHATEVER SHE WANTS.

243
00:13:26,015 --> 00:13:27,808
- SOUNDS FAMILIAR.
- WHAT?

244
00:13:27,891 --> 00:13:28,851
- NOTHING.

245
00:13:28,934 --> 00:13:30,477
I MEAN, THE IDEA
OF EVEN HAVING A QUEEN

246
00:13:30,561 --> 00:13:33,147
IS SO OUTDATED...
DON'T YOU AGREE, KORRA?

247
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:35,941
I HAVEN'T REALLY THOUGHT
ABOUT IT TOO MUCH.

248
00:13:36,108 --> 00:13:37,401
- WELL, YOU SHOULD START.

249
00:13:37,901 --> 00:13:39,445
THE WORLD IS EVOLVING,
AND THE EARTH QUEEN

250
00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:41,989
CAN EVOLVE WITH IT
OR STEP ASIDE.

251
00:13:42,072 --> 00:13:43,157
- HEY, EVERYONE,

252
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:45,659
MY LITTLE SISTER IS AN EXPERT
ON WORLD AFFAIRS NOW.

253
00:13:45,868 --> 00:13:47,745
YOU WANT TO TALK
ABOUT WHAT'S REALLY BUGGING YOU?

254
00:13:47,828 --> 00:13:49,580
BECAUSE I'M RIGHT HERE.

255
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:54,752
- SORRY WE'RE LATE, EVERYONE.

256
00:13:54,918 --> 00:13:57,296
VARRICK!

257
00:13:58,047 --> 00:14:01,091
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
- GREAT QUESTION, ASAMI.

258
00:14:01,258 --> 00:14:04,178
I MEAN,
WHAT ARE ANY OF US DOING HERE?

259
00:14:04,386 --> 00:14:06,263
WOW.
FOOD FOR THOUGHT.

260
00:14:06,388 --> 00:14:07,931
ANYHOO,
HOW'S OUR COMPANY DOING?

261
00:14:08,015 --> 00:14:09,475
- YOU MEAN MY COMPANY?

262
00:14:09,558 --> 00:14:11,393
FUTURE INDUSTRIES
REVERTED BACK TO ME

263
00:14:11,477 --> 00:14:13,645
AFTER YOU PLOTTED
TO ABDUCT THE PRESIDENT.

264
00:14:13,896 --> 00:14:16,774
ALLEGEDLY PLOTTED
TO ABDUCT THE PRESIDENT.

265
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:18,025
NEVER CONVICTED.

266
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:20,319
UH, THAT'S BECAUSE
YOU ESCAPED PRISON.

267
00:14:20,402 --> 00:14:23,530
NO, THE UNIVERSE
DECIDED TO SET ME FREE.

268
00:14:24,114 --> 00:14:26,408
SO I LOOKED UP
MY OLD FRIEND SUYIN HERE,

269
00:14:26,492 --> 00:14:28,410
PITCHED HER A FEW IDEAS,
AND BAM!

270
00:14:28,494 --> 00:14:29,953
WE'RE IN BUSINESS TOGETHER.

271
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:32,539
VARRICK'S HEADING UP
MY NEW TECHNOLOGY DIVISION.

272
00:14:32,623 --> 00:14:37,211
I'VE SEEN THE FUTURE,
AND THE FUTURE IS MAGNETS!

273
00:14:37,294 --> 00:14:38,629
I'M WORKING
ON A HIGH-SPEED RAIL

274
00:14:38,712 --> 00:14:40,130
THAT'LL REVOLUTIONIZE
TRANSPORTATION

275
00:14:40,255 --> 00:14:41,924
AND SHIPPING AS WE KNOW IT.

276
00:14:42,007 --> 00:14:43,425
BUT THAT'S NOT ALL!
I'M...

277
00:14:43,509 --> 00:14:44,593
- ALL RIGHT, ENOUGH!

278
00:14:44,802 --> 00:14:46,053
I'M TRYING TO KEEP
THE AVATAR SAFE,

279
00:14:46,136 --> 00:14:47,513
AND YOU'RE HARBORING
A CRIMINAL?

280
00:14:47,638 --> 00:14:48,722
- EASE UP, LIN.

281
00:14:48,806 --> 00:14:51,266
SURE, VARRICK'S MADE
A FEW MISTAKES IN HIS PAST,

282
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:54,019
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN HE SHOULD PAY
FOR IT THE REST OF HIS LIFE.

283
00:14:54,311 --> 00:14:57,481
MY CHEF WAS A PIRATE,
BUT NOW HE'S A CULINARY MASTER.

284
00:14:57,815 --> 00:14:58,899
PEOPLE CHANGE.

285
00:14:59,066 --> 00:15:01,652
- YOU HAVEN'T.

286
00:15:01,735 --> 00:15:03,404
- LIN!

287
00:15:10,327 --> 00:15:13,330
SO YOU AND OPAL
SEEMED TO HIT IT OFF AT DINNER.

288
00:15:13,455 --> 00:15:14,873
I THINK
SHE'S REALLY INTO YOU.

289
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:18,669
YEAH, YOU KNOW, SHE'S SWEET
AND PRETTY AND SUPER NICE.

290
00:15:18,877 --> 00:15:20,087
TOO BAD SHE'S NOT MY TYPE.

291
00:15:20,254 --> 00:15:21,672
- RIGHT, I FORGOT.

292
00:15:21,797 --> 00:15:25,426
YOUR TYPE IS DUMB MOVER STAR
OR PSYCHO ICE PRINCESS.

293
00:15:27,052 --> 00:15:29,805
YOU KNOW,
THAT HURTS A LITTLE BIT.

294
00:15:29,888 --> 00:15:32,015
RIGHT...HERE.

295
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:38,522
BUT MAYBE YOU'RE RIGHT, BRO.

296
00:15:39,773 --> 00:15:41,775
MAYBE OPAL
IS BOLIN MATERIAL.

297
00:15:42,109 --> 00:15:44,695
THANKS.
YEAH!

298
00:15:49,032 --> 00:15:50,742
YOU KNOW,
BEFORE I BUILT THIS CITY,

299
00:15:50,826 --> 00:15:52,244
THERE WAS NOTHING HERE.

300
00:15:52,327 --> 00:15:54,705
I WANTED TO MAKE MY MARK
ON THE WORLD.

301
00:15:54,872 --> 00:15:56,373
- IT'S AMAZING.

302
00:15:56,623 --> 00:15:58,167
THANK YOU FOR BEING
SO WELCOMING,

303
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:01,295
AND I'M SORRY
FOR HOW LIN'S BEEN ACTING.

304
00:16:01,378 --> 00:16:04,381
CAN I ASK,
WHAT HAPPENED WITH YOU TWO?

305
00:16:04,506 --> 00:16:05,799
- IT'S COMPLICATED.

306
00:16:06,383 --> 00:16:08,427
WE DIDN'T HAVE
A NORMAL CHILDHOOD.

307
00:16:08,802 --> 00:16:10,137
NEITHER OF US
KNEW OUR FATHERS,

308
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:13,515
AND TOPH WAS ALWAYS BUSY BEING
CHIEF OF POLICE.

309
00:16:13,599 --> 00:16:16,059
BECAUSE MOM GREW UP
IN SUCH A STRICT HOUSE,

310
00:16:16,393 --> 00:16:18,270
SHE GAVE US
ALL THE FREEDOM IN THE WORLD,

311
00:16:18,353 --> 00:16:20,814
HOPING WE'D FIGURE OUT
OUR OWN PATHS.

312
00:16:20,898 --> 00:16:22,274
THAT SOUNDS LIKE
A GOOD THING.

313
00:16:22,357 --> 00:16:24,067
- AND IN A WAY, IT WAS.

314
00:16:24,276 --> 00:16:27,237
BUT WE BOTH ENDED UP FIGHTING
FOR MOM'S ATTENTION.

315
00:16:27,613 --> 00:16:30,782
LIN FOLLOWED IN HER FOOTSTEPS
AND BECAME A COP.

316
00:16:30,908 --> 00:16:32,993
I WAS MORE OF A REBEL.

317
00:16:33,076 --> 00:16:35,996
MOM WASN'T TOO HAPPY WITH
HOW EITHER OF US TURNED OUT.

318
00:16:36,371 --> 00:16:39,875
WHEN I WAS 16, I LEFT HOME
TO EXPLORE THE WORLD.

319
00:16:39,958 --> 00:16:42,252
I SAILED THE SEAS
ON A PIRATE SHIP,

320
00:16:42,336 --> 00:16:44,588
JOINED A TRAVELING CIRCUS
FOR A WHILE,

321
00:16:44,671 --> 00:16:47,508
AND LIVED IN A SANDBENDER
COMMUNE IN THE DESERT.

322
00:16:47,591 --> 00:16:50,844
IT TOOK ME A WHILE,
BUT I FINALLY REALIZED

323
00:16:50,928 --> 00:16:53,180
WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR
WAS A FAMILY.

324
00:16:53,263 --> 00:16:55,098
SO I BOUGHT
THIS PLOT OF LAND,

325
00:16:55,182 --> 00:16:58,143
FOUND A BRILLIANT ARCHITECT
WHO LATER BECAME MY HUSBAND,

326
00:16:58,227 --> 00:17:01,021
AND CREATED A PLACE
I COULD TRULY CALL HOME.

327
00:17:01,104 --> 00:17:03,357
IT SOUNDS LIKE
YOU'VE CREATED THE PERFECT LIFE HERE.

328
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,525
- ALMOST.

329
00:17:04,608 --> 00:17:06,360
I'VE ALWAYS WANTED LIN
TO BE A PART OF IT,

330
00:17:06,443 --> 00:17:09,738
BUT I GAVE UP HOPE LONG AGO
OF HER EVER COMING AROUND.

331
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:23,210
- HEY, LITTLE LADY.

332
00:17:23,544 --> 00:17:28,674
WOW, YOU'RE REALLY BLOWING ME
AWAY WITH YOUR AIRBENDING.

333
00:17:32,928 --> 00:17:35,013
- WHY ARE YOU ACTING WEIRD?

334
00:17:35,097 --> 00:17:36,682
WHY ARE YOU
ACTING WEIRD?

335
00:17:36,765 --> 00:17:39,977
I DON'T LIKE
HOW YOU'RE TALKING TO ME.

336
00:17:40,811 --> 00:17:42,020
- LOOK, I'M SORRY.

337
00:17:42,104 --> 00:17:44,606
I JUST GET REALLY SELF-CONSCIOUS WHEN
I KNOW A GIRL LIKES ME,

338
00:17:44,690 --> 00:17:46,608
AND I END UP ACTING STUPID.

339
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:48,569
- WHO SAID I LIKED YOU?

340
00:17:48,652 --> 00:17:51,822
OH, NO!
BUT I THOUGHT...MAKO SAID...

341
00:17:52,114 --> 00:17:53,657
- JUST KIDDING.

342
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:56,451
BUT DO ME A FAVOR
AND STOP TRYING.

343
00:17:56,535 --> 00:17:58,537
LOOK, DON'T STOP TRYING.

344
00:17:58,745 --> 00:18:02,165
JUST STOP TRYING SO MUCH.
JUST BE YOURSELF.

345
00:18:02,291 --> 00:18:04,751
- HUH, BE MYSELF.

346
00:18:04,835 --> 00:18:07,838
YEAH, I GUESS
I COULD GIVE THAT A SHOT.

347
00:18:12,259 --> 00:18:13,510
- OH, HEY, KORRA.

348
00:18:13,594 --> 00:18:16,013
CAN I STEAL YOU AWAY
FROM BOLIN FOR A MINUTE?

349
00:18:16,138 --> 00:18:18,223
I NEED YOUR HELP
WITH SOMETHING.

350
00:18:39,036 --> 00:18:41,413
- "LET GO YOUR EARTHLY TETHER.

351
00:18:41,496 --> 00:18:43,040
"ENTER THE VOID.

352
00:18:43,123 --> 00:18:45,375
"EMPTY AND BECOME WIND."

353
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:46,835
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

354
00:18:46,918 --> 00:18:49,588
NO ONE'S ALLOWED
IN DADDY'S STUDY EXCEPT DADDY.

355
00:18:50,047 --> 00:18:53,508
I'M SORRY.
I COULDN'T SLEEP.

356
00:18:53,592 --> 00:18:55,469
- WHAT WERE YOU READING?

357
00:18:55,552 --> 00:18:57,763
- A POEM BY GURU LAGHIMA,

358
00:18:57,846 --> 00:19:00,974
THE WISEST AIRBENDER
WHO EVER LIVED.

359
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:06,063
- IKKI, YOU SHOULD BE IN BED.

360
00:19:06,146 --> 00:19:07,397
COME ON.

361
00:19:07,481 --> 00:19:11,234
- NIGHT.
- GOOD NIGHT.

362
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:14,029
YOU SEEM TO KNOW A LOT
ABOUT AIRBENDER HISTORY

363
00:19:14,112 --> 00:19:16,198
FOR SOMEONE
WHO JUST GOT AIRBENDING.

364
00:19:16,281 --> 00:19:18,408
I'VE ALWAYS ADMIRED
THE CULTURE.

365
00:19:18,492 --> 00:19:20,869
AND YOU MOVED THROUGH
THOSE GATES LIKE A NATURAL.

366
00:19:20,952 --> 00:19:22,579
WHERE DID YOU SAY
YOU WERE FROM?

367
00:19:22,663 --> 00:19:24,331
- A SMALL VILLAGE UP NORTH.

368
00:19:24,414 --> 00:19:26,875
YOU'VE PROBABLY
NEVER HEARD OF IT.

369
00:19:28,835 --> 00:19:29,836
- WAIT.

370
00:19:29,961 --> 00:19:32,005
ZAHEER!

371
00:19:43,225 --> 00:19:44,893
I NEED SOME HELP!

372
00:20:04,121 --> 00:20:06,248
- HOLD IT RIGHT THERE!

373
00:20:29,938 --> 00:20:32,733
SORRY I WON'T BE JOINING YOU
AT THE NORTHERN AIR TEMPLE.

374
00:20:32,899 --> 00:20:36,069
I'M AFRAID
I HAVE OTHER PLANS.

375
00:20:44,661 --> 00:20:47,497
WHO IS IT?

376
00:20:47,581 --> 00:20:48,999
- HEY, IT'S ME.

377
00:20:49,332 --> 00:20:52,586
I BROUGHT SOMEONE
WHO WANTS TO TALK TO YOU.

378
00:20:53,670 --> 00:20:56,631
YOU WANT TO TALK,
THEN TALK.

379
00:20:57,174 --> 00:20:59,926
I'M SORRY BEING HERE
HAS BEEN SO HARD FOR YOU.

380
00:21:00,010 --> 00:21:03,597
WHEN YOU SHOWED UP, I WAS
SO EXCITED TO GET TO KNOW YOU.

381
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:05,807
I'D HEARD
SO MANY GREAT THINGS ABOUT YOU

382
00:21:05,891 --> 00:21:07,726
FROM MOM AND GRANDMA TOPH.

383
00:21:07,809 --> 00:21:10,437
SO I GUESS
I WAS KIND OF SAD

384
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:13,982
THAT YOU DIDN'T
WANT TO GET TO KNOW ME.

385
00:21:15,233 --> 00:21:18,278
BELIEVE ME, I KNOW MY FAMILY
CAN BE A LITTLE CRAZY

386
00:21:18,361 --> 00:21:20,280
AND OVERWHELMING SOMETIMES,

387
00:21:20,363 --> 00:21:25,452
BUT I WOULD LOVE IT SO MUCH
IF YOU WOULD BE A PART OF IT.

388
00:21:25,535 --> 00:21:27,746
- GET OUT.

389
00:21:27,996 --> 00:21:30,957
SORRY.
DID I SAY SOMETHING WRONG?

390
00:21:31,082 --> 00:21:33,335
- GET OUT!

391
00:21:38,215 --> 00:21:39,466
- WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM?

392
00:21:39,633 --> 00:21:40,967
DON'T GET MAD AT OPAL.

393
00:21:41,051 --> 00:21:42,302
I ASKED HER TO TALK TO YOU

394
00:21:42,385 --> 00:21:43,637
BECAUSE I THOUGHT
IT WOULD HELP YOU

395
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:45,764
SNAP OUT OF WHATEVER FUNK
YOU'RE IN,

396
00:21:45,847 --> 00:21:46,973
BUT I GUESS I WAS WRONG.

397
00:21:47,057 --> 00:21:48,767
WHY DON'T YOU FOCUS
ON FIXING THE WORLD

398
00:21:48,850 --> 00:21:50,977
AND STOP TRYING
TO FIX MY FAMILY?

399
00:21:51,061 --> 00:21:54,272
SU'S RIGHT.
YOU'RE NEVER GOING TO CHANGE.

400
00:21:54,356 --> 00:21:57,400
YOU'RE ALWAYS GOING TO BE
A BITTER, LONELY WOMAN.
