1
00:00:07,583 --> 00:00:08,542
- EARTH.

2
00:00:08,583 --> 00:00:10,583
FIRE.

3
00:00:10,625 --> 00:00:12,417
AIR.

4
00:00:12,458 --> 00:00:14,625
WATER.

5
00:00:14,667 --> 00:00:18,333
ONLY THE AVATAR CAN MASTER
ALL FOUR ELEMENTS

6
00:00:18,375 --> 00:00:21,041
AND BRING BALANCE
TO THE WORLD.

7
00:00:27,166 --> 00:00:29,083
- IS THERE ANY PLACE SAFE
FOR THE AVATAR?

8
00:00:29,125 --> 00:00:31,917
FIRST, PRESIDENT RAIKO
BANISHED HER FROM REPUBLIC CITY.

9
00:00:31,959 --> 00:00:34,333
THEN THE EARTH QUEEN DECLARED
HER AN ENEMY OF THE KINGDOM

10
00:00:34,375 --> 00:00:37,333
AFTER KORRA RESCUED A GROUP
OF AIRBENDERS FROM BA SING SE.

11
00:00:37,375 --> 00:00:39,166
AND NOW KORRA
HAS LEARNED THAT ZAHEER

12
00:00:39,208 --> 00:00:40,542
AND HIS FELLOW CRIMINALS
ARE AFTER HER.

13
00:00:40,583 --> 00:00:42,625
WITH TENZIN BUSY BRINGING
THE NEW RECRUITS

14
00:00:42,667 --> 00:00:44,291
TO THE NORTHERN AIR TEMPLE,

15
00:00:44,333 --> 00:00:46,291
KORRA'S PROTECTION NOW RESTS
IN BEIFONG'S HANDS.

16
00:00:51,709 --> 00:00:52,834
[Naga growls]

17
00:00:52,875 --> 00:00:55,792
[Naga panting]

18
00:01:03,875 --> 00:01:06,125
- WHILE YOU'RE PLAYING FETCH,

19
00:01:06,166 --> 00:01:07,875
FOUR OF THE MOST DANGEROUS
CRIMINALS IN THE WORLD

20
00:01:07,917 --> 00:01:09,834
ARE HUNTING YOU DOWN.
WE SHOULD GET MOVING.

21
00:01:09,875 --> 00:01:11,750
- RELAX.
WE JUST GOT HERE.

22
00:01:11,792 --> 00:01:14,709
BESIDES, NO ONE KNOWS
WHERE I AM RIGHT NOW EXCEPT US.

23
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:20,125
I THINK SHE WANTS YOU
TO THROW IT FOR HER.

24
00:01:20,166 --> 00:01:21,750
[Naga whimpering]

25
00:01:21,792 --> 00:01:23,959
- I'LL PASS.
THANKS.

26
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,333
- WE JUST GOT A CALL ON THE
RADIO ABOUT ANOTHER AIRBENDER.

27
00:01:26,375 --> 00:01:28,166
- FINALLY.
WHERE ARE THEY?

28
00:01:28,208 --> 00:01:31,625
- A CITY CALLED ZAOFU,
THE HOME OF THE METAL CLAN.

29
00:01:31,667 --> 00:01:35,333
- YOU KNOW THE PLACE?
- UH, NEVER BEEN, BUT
I DON'T WANT YOU GOING THERE.

30
00:01:35,375 --> 00:01:38,291
I'D REST A LOT EASIER IF YOU
WERE BACK SAFE IN REPUBLIC CITY.

31
00:01:38,333 --> 00:01:41,083
- SORRY, BUT IF THERE'S
AN AIRBENDER IN ZAOFU,

32
00:01:41,125 --> 00:01:43,625
THEN THAT'S WHERE
WE'RE GOING NEXT.

33
00:01:43,667 --> 00:01:45,333
[Naga panting]

34
00:01:50,875 --> 00:01:54,542
[Naga whimpering]

35
00:02:00,917 --> 00:02:02,875
- WOW, WOW, WOW!

36
00:02:02,917 --> 00:02:05,583
AN ENTIRE CITY MADE OF METAL,
WHOO!

37
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:07,041
YOU SHOULD BE
RIGHT AT HOME, BEIFONG.

38
00:02:07,083 --> 00:02:09,041
- HMM.
[Pabu chirps]

39
00:02:28,709 --> 00:02:32,375
- YEAH!

40
00:02:32,417 --> 00:02:35,208
- AREN'T YOU COMING?
- WHAT'S THERE TO SEE?

41
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:36,709
IT'S METAL.
BIG WHOOP.

42
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:38,667
JUST FIND THE AIRBENDER,
AND LET'S GET MOVING.

43
00:02:38,709 --> 00:02:40,458
AND DON'T TELL ANYONE
I'M HERE.

44
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:41,792
- WHY NOT?

45
00:02:41,834 --> 00:02:43,583
- I DON'T NEED TO EXPLAIN MYSELF
TO YOU.

46
00:02:43,625 --> 00:02:45,291
JUST DO WHAT I SAY.

47
00:02:45,333 --> 00:02:49,000
- FINE.
YOU GOT IT, CHIEF CRANKY PANTS.

48
00:02:53,375 --> 00:02:56,917
- AVATAR KORRA,
IT IS AN HONOR TO MEET YOU.

49
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:58,667
MY NAME IS AIWEI.

50
00:02:58,709 --> 00:03:02,417
- THANKS FOR HAVING US.
- IS THIS EVERYONE?

51
00:03:02,458 --> 00:03:06,041
- YEP, JUST US.
SO CAN I MEET THE NEW AIRBENDER?

52
00:03:06,083 --> 00:03:08,125
- OF COURSE.
RIGHT THIS WAY.

53
00:03:21,709 --> 00:03:23,917
- AND THIS IS
THE AIR ACOLYTE DINING HALL,

54
00:03:23,959 --> 00:03:26,250
WHERE EVERYONE EATS,
AND THIS IS DAW.

55
00:03:26,291 --> 00:03:28,083
HE'S A NEW AIRBENDER TOO,
LIKE YOU GUYS.

56
00:03:28,125 --> 00:03:30,291
- [gasps]
IT'S SO NICE TO MEET YOU.

57
00:03:30,333 --> 00:03:32,375
HOW EXCITING.
NEW FRIENDS.

58
00:03:32,417 --> 00:03:34,083
- EXCUSE ME, HELLO?

59
00:03:34,125 --> 00:03:36,041
MY NAME IS YORRU.

60
00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:38,542
I HEARD THIS WAS THE PLACE TO
COME IF YOU'RE A NEW AIRBENDER.

61
00:03:38,583 --> 00:03:41,250
- YOU GOT THAT RIGHT,
STRANGER.

62
00:03:41,291 --> 00:03:42,667
- WELL, A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO,

63
00:03:42,709 --> 00:03:46,417
I WOKE UP, AND SUDDENLY,
I COULD DO THIS.

64
00:03:47,834 --> 00:03:50,792
- MOM, AUNT KYA,
WE GOT ANOTHER ONE!

65
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:14,333
- THAT STATUE HONORS
THE FIRST METALBENDER,

66
00:04:14,375 --> 00:04:16,917
TOPH BEIFONG,
WHO EXPANDED

67
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:19,250
THE POSSIBILITIES
OF WHAT BENDERS WERE CAPABLE OF.

68
00:04:19,291 --> 00:04:22,375
HERE, EVERYONE IS ENCOURAGED

69
00:04:22,417 --> 00:04:25,250
TO REACH
HIS OR HER HIGHEST POTENTIAL.

70
00:04:25,291 --> 00:04:27,875
- DOES TOPH LIVE HERE?

71
00:04:27,917 --> 00:04:30,667
ARE WE GONNA GET TO MEET HER?
- I'M AFRAID NOT.

72
00:04:30,709 --> 00:04:32,834
SHE USED TO VISIT
FROM TIME TO TIME,

73
00:04:32,875 --> 00:04:35,583
BUT YEARS AGO,
SHE LEFT TO WANDER THE WORLD

74
00:04:35,625 --> 00:04:37,458
IN SEARCH OF ENLIGHTENMENT.

75
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:39,750
NO ONE HAS SEEN HER SINCE.

76
00:04:56,333 --> 00:04:59,083
- WOW, IS THIS
WHERE THE AIRBENDER LIVES?

77
00:04:59,125 --> 00:05:03,166
- YES, BUT FIRST,
HER MOTHER WANTS TO MEET YOU.

78
00:05:14,875 --> 00:05:16,667
- IS THIS SOME KIND
OF COMBAT TRAINING?

79
00:05:16,709 --> 00:05:18,959
- NOT EXACTLY.

80
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,709
THEY ARE REHEARSING
FOR A DANCE PREMIERE NEXT MONTH.

81
00:05:31,125 --> 00:05:34,291
- THAT'S IT FOR TODAY,
EVERYONE.

82
00:05:34,333 --> 00:05:36,166
- ALLOW ME TO INTRODUCE

83
00:05:36,208 --> 00:05:38,667
THE MATRIARCH OF THE METAL CLAN,
SUYIN.

84
00:05:38,709 --> 00:05:40,375
- PLEASE, CALL ME SU.

85
00:05:40,417 --> 00:05:42,583
GREAT TO FINALLY MEET YOU,
AVATAR KORRA.

86
00:05:42,625 --> 00:05:46,000
AND THIS MUST BE
MAKO, BOLIN, AND ASAMI.

87
00:05:46,041 --> 00:05:47,583
- YOU'VE DONE YOUR RESEARCH.

88
00:05:47,625 --> 00:05:50,166
- I MAKE IT MY BUSINESS TO KNOW
WHO'S VISITING MY CITY.

89
00:05:50,208 --> 00:05:51,417
- SO YOU'RE A DANCER?

90
00:05:51,458 --> 00:05:54,166
- DANCER, LEADER,
WIFE, MOTHER,

91
00:05:54,208 --> 00:05:56,000
COLLECTOR OF RARE METEORITES.

92
00:05:56,041 --> 00:05:59,875
YOU'LL FIND PEOPLE HERE
HAVE MANY SKILLS AND INTERESTS.

93
00:05:59,917 --> 00:06:01,667
- [whispering]

94
00:06:01,709 --> 00:06:03,291
- KORRA, WHY DID YOU LIE

95
00:06:03,333 --> 00:06:05,000
WHEN AIWEI ASKED IF THERE WAS
ANYONE ELSE WITH YOU?

96
00:06:05,041 --> 00:06:07,458
- WHAT?
I-I DIDN'T.

97
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,166
I MEAN...
- [whimpers]

98
00:06:09,208 --> 00:06:10,375
- HOW DID YOU KNOW
I WAS LYING?

99
00:06:10,417 --> 00:06:12,041
- I AM A TRUTH SEER.

100
00:06:12,083 --> 00:06:13,625
WHEN PEOPLE LIE,

101
00:06:13,667 --> 00:06:16,208
THEIR HEART RATE
AND BREATHING INCREASE.

102
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:19,875
I CAN SENSE
THE MOST SUBTLE OF CHANGES.

103
00:06:19,917 --> 00:06:23,375
- THANKS TO AIWEI, THERE ARE
NO SECRETS IN OUR CITY.

104
00:06:23,417 --> 00:06:26,083
- WE CAME WITH
REPUBLIC CITY'S CHIEF OF POLICE.

105
00:06:26,125 --> 00:06:28,542
SHE DIDN'T WANT ANYONE
TO KNOW SHE WAS HERE.

106
00:06:28,583 --> 00:06:29,875
I'M SORRY I DIDN'T TELL YOU.

107
00:06:29,917 --> 00:06:33,500
- LIN'S HERE?
WELL, I WOULD LOVE TO SAY HELLO.

108
00:06:33,542 --> 00:06:35,375
- WAIT, YOU TWO
KNOW EACH OTHER?

109
00:06:35,417 --> 00:06:38,792
- YOU'RE JOKING, RIGHT?

110
00:06:38,834 --> 00:06:41,375
OH, LIN NEVER TOLD YOU
ABOUT ME.

111
00:06:41,417 --> 00:06:43,125
- NO.
WHY WOULD SHE?

112
00:06:43,166 --> 00:06:46,667
- I'M LIN'S SISTER.

113
00:06:50,333 --> 00:06:52,458
- I FOUND OUT WHY
YOU WERE SO AGAINST COMING HERE.

114
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,208
WHY DIDN'T YOU EVER TELL ME
YOU HAD A SISTER?

115
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:56,041
- HALF-SISTER.

116
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:57,458
- SAME MOM, DIFFERENT DADS.

117
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,667
SO WHAT?
WE'RE BLOOD, LIN.

118
00:06:59,709 --> 00:07:02,542
AND AFTER 30 YEARS, THE LEAST
YOU COULD DO IS SAY HELLO.

119
00:07:02,583 --> 00:07:05,500
- I HAVE NOTHING
TO SAY TO YOU.

120
00:07:10,583 --> 00:07:13,417
- YOU TWO HAVEN'T SPOKEN
IN 30 YEARS--HOW COME?

121
00:07:13,458 --> 00:07:15,834
- ASK HER.
I'VE TRIED.

122
00:07:15,875 --> 00:07:17,375
- OH, DON'T PUT THAT ON ME.

123
00:07:17,417 --> 00:07:19,041
YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO TORE OUR FAMILY APART.

124
00:07:19,083 --> 00:07:21,834
- AND YOU'VE DONE A BANG-UP JOB
KEEPING IT THAT WAY.

125
00:07:21,875 --> 00:07:23,959
- YOU HAVEN'T CHANGED ONE BIT,
HAVE YOU?

126
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,625
- LOOK, WE CAN STAND HERE
ARGUING ABOUT THE PAST ALL DAY,

127
00:07:26,667 --> 00:07:28,750
BUT THAT'S NOT THE REASON
THE AVATAR CAME HERE.

128
00:07:28,792 --> 00:07:31,709
MY DAUGHTER IS THRILLED
TO MEET YOU.

129
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:34,458
- LIN, YOUR NIECE
IS THE NEW AIRBENDER.

130
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:35,834
ISN'T THAT AMAZING?

131
00:07:35,875 --> 00:07:39,083
- YEAH. TERRIFIC.

132
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:42,208
- THOSE ARE MY TWO YOUNGEST,
WEI AND WING.

133
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:44,000
THEY'RE PLAYING A GAME CALLED
POWER DISC.

134
00:07:44,041 --> 00:07:46,083
THEY INVENTED IT
ALL ON THEIR OWN.

135
00:07:46,125 --> 00:07:49,000
- YAH!
[metal clangs]

136
00:07:49,041 --> 00:07:50,750
- [grunts]
[metal clangs]

137
00:07:50,792 --> 00:07:52,667
- [groans]
[buzzer]

138
00:07:52,709 --> 00:07:54,500
- OH, NICE POWER, WEI.

139
00:07:54,542 --> 00:07:55,709
- [groans]

140
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:57,500
- HA!
WING GOES DOWN.

141
00:07:57,542 --> 00:08:00,542
- I'M SO PROUD OF THOSE TWO.

142
00:08:07,792 --> 00:08:10,500
[metal creaks]

143
00:08:16,709 --> 00:08:19,542
HUAN, I WANT YOU TO MEET
THE AVATAR AND HER FRIENDS

144
00:08:19,583 --> 00:08:21,041
AND YOUR AUNT LIN.

145
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:23,792
- NICE TO MEET YOU.
- HEY.

146
00:08:23,834 --> 00:08:27,583
- WOW,
THAT'S A REALLY NICE...BANANA?

147
00:08:27,625 --> 00:08:29,750
YES, VERY, VERY LIFELIKE.

148
00:08:29,792 --> 00:08:32,834
- [sighs]
IT'S NOT A BANANA!

149
00:08:32,875 --> 00:08:34,834
I WAS INSPIRED
BY HARMONIC CONVERGENCE.

150
00:08:34,875 --> 00:08:38,875
IT REPRESENTS THE DAWNING
OF A NEW AGE, OBVIOUSLY.

151
00:08:38,917 --> 00:08:41,417
- OH, YEAH, NO, I C--
I CAN TOTALLY SEE THAT.

152
00:08:41,458 --> 00:08:43,750
I--WAIT, LET ME STAND HERE.
YES, I CAN SEE THAT NOW.

153
00:08:43,792 --> 00:08:45,291
YES. THANK YOU.

154
00:08:45,333 --> 00:08:48,500
[murmurs] BANANA.
I MEAN, THAT'S A BANANA, RIGHT?

155
00:08:51,041 --> 00:08:53,000
- AND THIS IS
MY DAUGHTER OPAL.

156
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:55,917
- WOW, AVATAR KORRA.

157
00:08:55,959 --> 00:08:57,875
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU'RE REALLY HERE.

158
00:08:57,917 --> 00:08:59,667
YOU ARE SO AMAZING.

159
00:08:59,709 --> 00:09:01,166
- IT'S GREAT
TO MEET YOU, OPAL.

160
00:09:01,208 --> 00:09:03,625
- OPAL?
THAT'S A BEAUTIFUL NAME.

161
00:09:03,667 --> 00:09:05,750
- THANKS.
- I'M BOLIN.

162
00:09:05,792 --> 00:09:08,333
- OPAL, BUT, UH,
YOU ALREADY KNEW THAT.

163
00:09:12,041 --> 00:09:13,542
- GREAT.
WE FOUND THE AIRBENDER.

164
00:09:13,583 --> 00:09:15,375
LET'S TAKE HER BACK TO
THE AIRSHIP AND GET OUT OF HERE.

165
00:09:15,417 --> 00:09:17,583
- AND THE WOMAN APPARENTLY
TRYING TO ABDUCT YOU

166
00:09:17,625 --> 00:09:19,083
IS YOUR AUNT LIN.

167
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:21,750
- REALLY?
I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO MEET YOU.

168
00:09:21,792 --> 00:09:24,500
MY MOM HAS TOLD ME
SO MANY STORIES ABOUT YOU.

169
00:09:24,542 --> 00:09:26,166
- I'M SURE SHE HAS.

170
00:09:26,208 --> 00:09:27,917
- SO I'VE SET ALL OF YOU UP
IN THE GUESTHOUSES

171
00:09:27,959 --> 00:09:29,291
WHILE KORRA TRAINS OPAL.

172
00:09:29,333 --> 00:09:31,500
- OH, I'M SORRY,
BUT I WAS HOPING

173
00:09:31,542 --> 00:09:33,083
SHE COULD TRAIN
WITH THE REST OF THE AIRBENDERS

174
00:09:33,125 --> 00:09:34,458
AT THE NORTHERN TEMPLE.

175
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,583
- THAT SOUNDS AMAZING.
- NONSENSE.

176
00:09:36,625 --> 00:09:38,458
THIS IS WHERE OPAL'S HOME
AND FAMILY ARE.

177
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:39,875
YOU CAN TRAIN HER HERE.

178
00:09:39,917 --> 00:09:41,458
- I GUESS
I COULD HELP HER GET STARTED.

179
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:43,333
- ABSOLUTELY NOT.
WE'RE LEAVING.

180
00:09:43,375 --> 00:09:44,959
- SHE'S JUST A LITTLE WORRIED

181
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,333
BECAUSE THERE ARE A BUNCH
OF CRAZY CRIMINALS AFTER ME.

182
00:09:47,375 --> 00:09:49,417
- IF YOU'RE CONCERNED
ABOUT SECURITY, DON'T BE.

183
00:09:49,458 --> 00:09:52,208
THIS IS THE SAFEST CITY
IN THE WORLD.

184
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:54,500
NOW, I'LL SEE YOU ALL AT DINNER,
AND COME HUNGRY.

185
00:09:54,542 --> 00:09:57,625
MY CHEF WILL BLOW THE TASTE BUDS
RIGHT OUT OF YOUR MOUTH.

186
00:09:59,375 --> 00:10:01,291
- WHY DO YOU HAVE SUCH A PROBLEM
WITH YOUR SISTER?

187
00:10:01,333 --> 00:10:03,583
SHE SEEMS NICE.

188
00:10:03,625 --> 00:10:05,583
COME ON,
WE CAN STAY A LITTLE WHILE.

189
00:10:05,625 --> 00:10:06,834
- [grumbles]

190
00:10:09,583 --> 00:10:11,500
- OKAY, LET'S SEE
WHAT YOU GOT.

191
00:10:11,542 --> 00:10:14,959
- I'M NOT VERY GOOD.
- THAT'S OKAY.

192
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,333
I'VE NEVER BEEN
A TEACHER BEFORE,

193
00:10:16,375 --> 00:10:18,250
SO WE'RE IN THE SAME BOAT.

194
00:10:18,291 --> 00:10:20,166
YOU WANNA KEEP YOUR ELBOWS IN,

195
00:10:20,208 --> 00:10:24,917
TORSO STRAIGHT,
FEET JUST SKIMMING THE GROUND.

196
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:28,291
WHY DON'T YOU
TRY IT WITH ME?

197
00:10:42,417 --> 00:10:45,500
WOW,
YOU'RE A NATURAL.

198
00:10:45,542 --> 00:10:46,583
- YOU REALLY THINK SO?

199
00:10:46,625 --> 00:10:48,542
THANKS.

200
00:10:55,458 --> 00:10:59,000
- [grunts]

201
00:10:59,041 --> 00:11:01,333
- YOU CALL YOURSELF
AN AIRBENDER?

202
00:11:01,375 --> 00:11:05,166
DISGRACEFUL!

203
00:11:05,208 --> 00:11:08,750
- [groans]

204
00:11:08,792 --> 00:11:11,083
- BE THE LEAF!

205
00:11:11,125 --> 00:11:13,792
- BUT I DON'T KNOW
WHAT THAT MEANS!

206
00:11:27,709 --> 00:11:30,542
- NOW THAT MAN'S A LEAF.

207
00:11:30,583 --> 00:11:33,792
- THE STUDENT IS
ONLY AS GOOD AS HIS MASTER.

208
00:11:33,834 --> 00:11:36,083
[Poki grumbles]

209
00:11:36,125 --> 00:11:37,083
- GREAT NEWS.

210
00:11:37,125 --> 00:11:38,709
I JUST GOT A MESSAGE
FROM TENZIN.

211
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:40,417
HE'S WITH A WHOLE GROUP
OF OTHER AIRBENDERS

212
00:11:40,458 --> 00:11:42,875
AT THE NORTHERN TEMPLE, AND HE
WANTS ALL OF YOU TO JOIN THEM.

213
00:11:42,917 --> 00:11:44,083
WE LEAVE FIRST THING
IN THE MORNING.

214
00:11:44,125 --> 00:11:47,000
- AND THE AVATAR IS WITH THEM?

215
00:11:47,041 --> 00:11:49,417
- NO, APPARENTLY SHE HAD
TO SPLIT OFF FROM TENZIN.

216
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:52,166
- THAT'S UNFORTUNATE.

217
00:11:52,208 --> 00:11:55,250
I WAS REALLY LOOKING FORWARD
TO MEETING HER.

218
00:11:55,291 --> 00:11:57,959
[metal creaks]

219
00:12:03,875 --> 00:12:06,542
- TONIGHT,
FOR YOUR DINING PLEASURE,

220
00:12:06,583 --> 00:12:09,583
I PRESENT A SEARED WILD KYOSHI
ELEPHANT KOI,

221
00:12:09,625 --> 00:12:12,709
PAIRED WITH A GINGER-INFUSED
PEA TENDRIL

222
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:14,834
AND HIBISCUS ROOT SALAD.

223
00:12:14,875 --> 00:12:16,542
- STUNNING.

224
00:12:20,333 --> 00:12:23,333
- SORRY, DEAR, I'M GOING TO HAVE
TO TAKE DINNER IN MY OFFICE.

225
00:12:23,375 --> 00:12:26,166
I JUST HAD A MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH
ON THE TRAM STATION REMODEL.

226
00:12:26,208 --> 00:12:28,667
- WELL, DON'T LET ME
STAND IN THE WAY OF INSPIRATION.

227
00:12:28,709 --> 00:12:30,333
- YOU'RE THE BEST.

228
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:32,834
- THAT WAS MY BRILLIANT
ARCHITECT OF A HUSBAND, BAATAR,

229
00:12:32,875 --> 00:12:34,250
AND OUR OLDEST SON.

230
00:12:34,291 --> 00:12:36,375
HE ENGINEERS
ALL MY HUSBAND'S PROJECTS.

231
00:12:36,417 --> 00:12:38,583
- FIVE KIDS.
WHAT A NIGHTMARE.

232
00:12:38,625 --> 00:12:40,792
- NO, NO,
MY CHILDREN ARE A BLESSING.

233
00:12:40,834 --> 00:12:42,250
- YEAH,
MOM USED TO SAY THAT TOO,

234
00:12:42,291 --> 00:12:45,583
BUT SHE NEVER MEANT IT.

235
00:12:45,625 --> 00:12:47,166
- MMM.

236
00:12:47,208 --> 00:12:49,166
I HAVE TO ADMIT,
I WAS PRETTY SKEPTICAL

237
00:12:49,208 --> 00:12:51,333
WHEN HE SAID "PEA TENDRIL..."
[laughs]

238
00:12:51,375 --> 00:12:52,583
BUT THIS IS DELICIOUS!

239
00:12:52,625 --> 00:12:54,959
- [giggles]
I KNOW, RIGHT?

240
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,125
I DON'T THINK I'VE EVER HAD
A BAD MEAL IN MY LIFE.

241
00:12:57,166 --> 00:12:58,750
- OH, I HAD PLENTY

242
00:12:58,792 --> 00:13:00,458
WHEN MAKO AND I
WERE LIVING ON THE STREETS.

243
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:04,250
I MEAN, YOU'D BE SURPRISED HOW
BAD FOOD FROM A DUMPSTER CAN BE.

244
00:13:04,291 --> 00:13:06,417
- I'M SORRY.
I DIDN'T KNOW.

245
00:13:06,458 --> 00:13:08,333
- NO, IT'S OKAY, IT'S OKAY.
THAT'S ALL IN THE PAST.

246
00:13:08,375 --> 00:13:09,417
THINGS ARE GREAT NOW.

247
00:13:09,458 --> 00:13:10,959
I GOT TO BE A PRO BENDER,

248
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,375
FOUGHT AGAINST
A DANGEROUS REVOLUTION,

249
00:13:12,417 --> 00:13:14,750
BECAME A MOVER STAR,

250
00:13:14,792 --> 00:13:17,750
AND NOW I'M HELPING THE AVATAR
REBUILD A WHOLE NATION.

251
00:13:17,792 --> 00:13:21,333
- WOW, YOUR LIFE
SOUNDS SO EXCITING.

252
00:13:21,375 --> 00:13:23,417
- HOW'S YOUR SEARCH
FOR THE NEW AIRBENDERS GOING?

253
00:13:23,458 --> 00:13:26,041
- HONESTLY, NOT GREAT.

254
00:13:26,083 --> 00:13:28,291
WE HAD TO RESCUE A WHOLE GROUP
OF THEM FROM THE EARTH QUEEN.

255
00:13:28,333 --> 00:13:30,125
- OH, SHE'S HORRIBLE.

256
00:13:30,166 --> 00:13:31,709
SHE THINKS SHE CAN
JUST DO WHATEVER SHE WANTS.

257
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:33,667
- SOUNDS FAMILIAR.
- WHAT?

258
00:13:33,709 --> 00:13:35,000
- NOTHING.

259
00:13:35,041 --> 00:13:36,750
- I MEAN, THE IDEA
OF EVEN HAVING A QUEEN

260
00:13:36,792 --> 00:13:39,291
IS SO OUTDATED--
DON'T YOU AGREE, KORRA?

261
00:13:39,333 --> 00:13:41,792
- I HAVEN'T REALLY THOUGHT
ABOUT IT TOO MUCH.

262
00:13:41,834 --> 00:13:44,166
- WELL, YOU SHOULD START.

263
00:13:44,208 --> 00:13:45,625
THE WORLD IS EVOLVING,
AND THE EARTH QUEEN

264
00:13:45,667 --> 00:13:47,333
CAN EVOLVE WITH IT
OR STEP ASIDE.

265
00:13:47,375 --> 00:13:49,333
- HEY, EVERYONE,

266
00:13:49,375 --> 00:13:51,750
MY LITTLE SISTER IS AN EXPERT
ON WORLD AFFAIRS NOW.

267
00:13:51,792 --> 00:13:53,458
- YOU WANNA TALK
ABOUT WHAT'S REALLY BUGGING YOU?

268
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,625
BECAUSE I'M RIGHT HERE.

269
00:13:58,709 --> 00:14:00,667
- SORRY WE'RE LATE, EVERYONE.

270
00:14:00,709 --> 00:14:04,125
- [gasps]
VARRICK!

271
00:14:04,166 --> 00:14:07,208
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
- GREAT QUESTION, ASAMI.

272
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:10,250
I MEAN,
WHAT ARE ANY OF US DOING HERE?

273
00:14:10,291 --> 00:14:12,250
WOW.
FOOD FOR THOUGHT.

274
00:14:12,291 --> 00:14:13,834
ANYHOO,
HOW'S OUR COMPANY DOING?

275
00:14:13,875 --> 00:14:15,583
- YOU MEAN MY COMPANY?

276
00:14:15,625 --> 00:14:17,583
FUTURE INDUSTRIES
REVERTED BACK TO ME

277
00:14:17,625 --> 00:14:20,000
AFTER YOU PLOTTED
TO ABDUCT THE PRESIDENT.

278
00:14:20,041 --> 00:14:22,583
- ALLEGEDLY PLOTTED
TO ABDUCT THE PRESIDENT.

279
00:14:22,625 --> 00:14:24,291
NEVER CONVICTED.

280
00:14:24,333 --> 00:14:26,166
- UH, THAT'S BECAUSE
YOU ESCAPED PRISON.

281
00:14:26,208 --> 00:14:30,000
- NO, THE UNIVERSE
DECIDED TO SET ME FREE.

282
00:14:30,041 --> 00:14:32,542
SO I LOOKED UP
MY OLD FRIEND SUYIN HERE,

283
00:14:32,583 --> 00:14:34,583
PITCHED HER A FEW IDEAS,
AND BAM!

284
00:14:34,625 --> 00:14:36,208
WE'RE IN BUSINESS TOGETHER.

285
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:38,458
- VARRICK'S HEADING UP
MY NEW TECHNOLOGY DIVISION.

286
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:43,333
- I'VE SEEN THE FUTURE,
AND THE FUTURE IS MAGNETS!

287
00:14:43,375 --> 00:14:44,959
I'M WORKING
ON A HIGH-SPEED RAIL

288
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,417
THAT'LL REVOLUTIONIZE
TRANSPORTATION

289
00:14:46,458 --> 00:14:48,125
AND SHIPPING AS WE KNOW IT.

290
00:14:48,166 --> 00:14:49,375
BUT THAT'S NOT ALL!
I'M--

291
00:14:49,417 --> 00:14:50,834
- ALL RIGHT, ENOUGH!

292
00:14:50,875 --> 00:14:52,291
I'M TRYING TO KEEP
THE AVATAR SAFE,

293
00:14:52,333 --> 00:14:53,333
AND YOU'RE HARBORING
A CRIMINAL?

294
00:14:53,375 --> 00:14:54,959
- EASE UP, LIN.

295
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,500
SURE, VARRICK'S MADE
A FEW MISTAKES IN HIS PAST,

296
00:14:57,542 --> 00:15:00,417
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN HE SHOULD
PAY FOR IT THE REST OF HIS LIFE.

297
00:15:00,458 --> 00:15:03,583
MY CHEF WAS A PIRATE,
BUT NOW HE'S A CULINARY MASTER.

298
00:15:03,625 --> 00:15:04,834
PEOPLE CHANGE.

299
00:15:04,875 --> 00:15:07,667
- YOU HAVEN'T.

300
00:15:07,709 --> 00:15:09,125
- LIN!

301
00:15:15,959 --> 00:15:19,291
- SO YOU AND OPAL
SEEMED TO HIT IT OFF AT DINNER.

302
00:15:19,333 --> 00:15:21,041
I THINK
SHE'S REALLY INTO YOU.

303
00:15:21,083 --> 00:15:24,625
- YEAH, YOU KNOW, SHE'S SWEET
AND PRETTY AND SUPER NICE.

304
00:15:24,667 --> 00:15:25,917
TOO BAD SHE'S NOT MY TYPE.

305
00:15:25,959 --> 00:15:28,125
- RIGHT, I FORGOT.

306
00:15:28,166 --> 00:15:31,208
YOUR TYPE IS DUMB MOVER STAR
OR PSYCHO ICE PRINCESS.

307
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:32,834
- [spits]

308
00:15:32,875 --> 00:15:35,583
YOU KNOW,
THAT HURTS A LITTLE BIT.

309
00:15:35,625 --> 00:15:38,542
RIGHT...HERE.

310
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:45,792
BUT MAYBE YOU'RE RIGHT, BRO.

311
00:15:45,834 --> 00:15:47,792
MAYBE OPAL
IS BOLIN MATERIAL.

312
00:15:47,834 --> 00:15:50,583
THANKS.
YEAH!

313
00:15:55,208 --> 00:15:56,834
- YOU KNOW,
BEFORE I BUILT THIS CITY,

314
00:15:56,875 --> 00:15:58,041
THERE WAS NOTHING HERE.

315
00:15:58,083 --> 00:16:00,500
I WANTED TO MAKE MY MARK
ON THE WORLD.

316
00:16:00,542 --> 00:16:02,667
- IT'S AMAZING.

317
00:16:02,709 --> 00:16:04,458
THANK YOU FOR BEING
SO WELCOMING,

318
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:07,125
AND I'M SORRY
FOR HOW LIN'S BEEN ACTING.

319
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:10,625
CAN I ASK,
WHAT HAPPENED WITH YOU TWO?

320
00:16:10,667 --> 00:16:12,166
- IT'S COMPLICATED.

321
00:16:12,208 --> 00:16:14,625
WE DIDN'T HAVE
A NORMAL CHILDHOOD.

322
00:16:14,667 --> 00:16:16,000
NEITHER OF US
KNEW OUR FATHERS,

323
00:16:16,041 --> 00:16:19,458
AND TOPH WAS ALWAYS BUSY BEING
CHIEF OF POLICE.

324
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:21,875
BECAUSE MOM GREW UP
IN SUCH A STRICT HOUSE,

325
00:16:21,917 --> 00:16:24,000
SHE GAVE US
ALL THE FREEDOM IN THE WORLD,

326
00:16:24,041 --> 00:16:26,709
HOPING WE'D FIGURE OUT
OUR OWN PATHS.

327
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:28,041
- THAT SOUNDS LIKE
A GOOD THING.

328
00:16:28,083 --> 00:16:30,250
- AND IN A WAY, IT WAS.

329
00:16:30,291 --> 00:16:33,166
BUT WE BOTH ENDED UP FIGHTING
FOR MOM'S ATTENTION.

330
00:16:33,208 --> 00:16:36,625
LIN FOLLOWED IN HER FOOTSTEPS
AND BECAME A COP.

331
00:16:36,667 --> 00:16:39,166
I WAS MORE OF A REBEL.

332
00:16:39,208 --> 00:16:42,166
MOM WASN'T TOO HAPPY WITH
HOW EITHER OF US TURNED OUT.

333
00:16:42,208 --> 00:16:45,750
WHEN I WAS 16, I LEFT HOME
TO EXPLORE THE WORLD.

334
00:16:45,792 --> 00:16:48,125
I SAILED THE SEAS
ON A PIRATE SHIP,

335
00:16:48,166 --> 00:16:50,333
JOINED A TRAVELING CIRCUS
FOR A WHILE,

336
00:16:50,375 --> 00:16:53,166
AND LIVED IN A SANDBENDER
COMMUNE IN THE DESERT.

337
00:16:53,208 --> 00:16:56,834
IT TOOK ME A WHILE,
BUT I FINALLY REALIZED

338
00:16:56,875 --> 00:16:59,041
WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR
WAS A FAMILY.

339
00:16:59,083 --> 00:17:01,291
SO I BOUGHT
THIS PLOT OF LAND,

340
00:17:01,333 --> 00:17:03,917
FOUND A BRILLIANT ARCHITECT
WHO LATER BECAME MY HUSBAND,

341
00:17:03,959 --> 00:17:06,792
AND CREATED A PLACE
I COULD TRULY CALL HOME.

342
00:17:06,834 --> 00:17:09,041
- IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU'VE CREATED
THE PERFECT LIFE HERE.

343
00:17:09,083 --> 00:17:10,667
- ALMOST.

344
00:17:10,709 --> 00:17:12,250
I'VE ALWAYS WANTED LIN
TO BE A PART OF IT,

345
00:17:12,291 --> 00:17:15,750
BUT I GAVE UP HOPE LONG AGO
OF HER EVER COMING AROUND.

346
00:17:27,083 --> 00:17:29,458
- HEY, LITTLE LADY.

347
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:34,291
WOW, YOU'RE REALLY BLOWING ME
AWAY WITH YOUR AIRBENDING.

348
00:17:34,333 --> 00:17:38,375
[imitates whooshing]

349
00:17:38,417 --> 00:17:40,750
- WHY ARE YOU ACTING WEIRD?

350
00:17:40,792 --> 00:17:42,750
- WHY ARE YOU
ACTING WEIRD?

351
00:17:42,792 --> 00:17:46,542
- I DON'T LIKE
HOW YOU'RE TALKING TO ME.

352
00:17:46,583 --> 00:17:48,208
- LOOK, I'M SORRY.

353
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:50,583
I JUST GET REALLY SELF-CONSCIOUS
WHEN I KNOW A GIRL LIKES ME,

354
00:17:50,625 --> 00:17:52,500
AND I END UP ACTING STUPID.

355
00:17:52,542 --> 00:17:54,542
- WHO SAID I LIKED YOU?

356
00:17:54,583 --> 00:17:57,709
- OH, NO!
BUT I THOUGHT--MAKO SAID--

357
00:17:57,750 --> 00:17:59,667
- JUST KIDDING.

358
00:17:59,709 --> 00:18:02,542
BUT DO ME A FAVOR
AND STOP TRYING.

359
00:18:02,583 --> 00:18:04,709
WELL, DON'T STOP TRYING.

360
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:07,750
JUST STOP TRYING SO MUCH.
JUST BE YOURSELF.

361
00:18:07,792 --> 00:18:10,834
- HUH, BE MYSELF.

362
00:18:10,875 --> 00:18:13,333
YEAH, I GUESS
I COULD GIVE THAT A SHOT.

363
00:18:17,041 --> 00:18:18,333
- [clears throat]

364
00:18:18,375 --> 00:18:20,000
- OH, HEY, KORRA.

365
00:18:20,041 --> 00:18:22,125
- CAN I STEAL YOU AWAY
FROM BOLIN FOR A MINUTE?

366
00:18:22,166 --> 00:18:24,750
I NEED YOUR HELP
WITH SOMETHING.

367
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:47,166
- "LET GO YOUR EARTHLY TETHER.

368
00:18:47,208 --> 00:18:48,500
"ENTER THE VOID.

369
00:18:48,542 --> 00:18:51,291
EMPTY AND BECOME WIND."

370
00:18:51,333 --> 00:18:53,208
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

371
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:55,417
NO ONE'S ALLOWED
IN DADDY'S STUDY EXCEPT DADDY.

372
00:18:55,458 --> 00:18:58,667
- I'M SORRY.
I COULDN'T SLEEP.

373
00:18:58,709 --> 00:19:01,083
- WHAT WERE YOU READING?

374
00:19:01,125 --> 00:19:03,875
- A POEM BY GURU LAGHIMA,

375
00:19:03,917 --> 00:19:07,041
THE WISEST AIRBENDER
WHO EVER LIVED.

376
00:19:07,083 --> 00:19:09,000
[footsteps approaching]

377
00:19:09,041 --> 00:19:12,083
- IKKI, YOU SHOULD BE IN BED.

378
00:19:12,125 --> 00:19:13,583
COME ON.

379
00:19:13,625 --> 00:19:17,000
- NIGHT.
- GOOD NIGHT.

380
00:19:17,041 --> 00:19:20,083
- YOU SEEM TO KNOW A LOT
ABOUT AIRBENDER HISTORY

381
00:19:20,125 --> 00:19:22,166
FOR SOMEONE
WHO JUST GOT AIRBENDING.

382
00:19:22,208 --> 00:19:24,458
- I'VE ALWAYS ADMIRED
THE CULTURE.

383
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:26,959
- AND YOU MOVED THROUGH
THOSE GATES LIKE A NATURAL.

384
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,458
WHERE DID YOU SAY
YOU WERE FROM?

385
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,500
- A SMALL VILLAGE UP NORTH.

386
00:19:30,542 --> 00:19:34,333
YOU'VE PROBABLY
NEVER HEARD OF IT.

387
00:19:34,375 --> 00:19:35,333
- WAIT.

388
00:19:35,375 --> 00:19:37,291
ZAHEER!

389
00:19:48,667 --> 00:19:50,417
I NEED SOME HELP!

390
00:19:50,458 --> 00:19:52,375
- [grunts]

391
00:19:53,583 --> 00:19:55,834
[groans]

392
00:20:05,625 --> 00:20:07,542
- [grunts]

393
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:12,917
- HOLD IT RIGHT THERE!

394
00:20:20,417 --> 00:20:23,083
[both grunt]

395
00:20:31,834 --> 00:20:35,667
- [groans]

396
00:20:35,709 --> 00:20:38,542
- SORRY I WON'T BE JOINING YOU
AT THE NORTHERN AIR TEMPLE.

397
00:20:38,583 --> 00:20:41,250
I'M AFRAID
I HAVE OTHER PLANS.

398
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:53,000
[knocks on door]
- WHO IS IT?

399
00:20:53,041 --> 00:20:54,667
- HEY, IT'S ME.

400
00:20:54,709 --> 00:20:58,000
I BROUGHT SOMEONE
WHO WANTS TO TALK TO YOU.

401
00:20:59,417 --> 00:21:02,500
- YOU WANNA TALK,
THEN TALK.

402
00:21:02,542 --> 00:21:05,750
- I'M SORRY BEING HERE
HAS BEEN SO HARD FOR YOU.

403
00:21:05,792 --> 00:21:09,250
WHEN YOU SHOWED UP, I WAS
SO EXCITED TO GET TO KNOW YOU.

404
00:21:09,291 --> 00:21:11,166
I'D HEARD
SO MANY GREAT THINGS ABOUT YOU

405
00:21:11,208 --> 00:21:13,166
FROM MOM AND GRANDMA TOPH.

406
00:21:13,208 --> 00:21:16,000
SO I GUESS
I WAS KIND OF SAD

407
00:21:16,041 --> 00:21:19,125
THAT YOU DIDN'T
WANNA GET TO KNOW ME.

408
00:21:20,959 --> 00:21:23,625
BELIEVE ME, I KNOW MY FAMILY
CAN BE A LITTLE CRAZY

409
00:21:23,667 --> 00:21:25,875
AND OVERWHELMING SOMETIMES,

410
00:21:25,917 --> 00:21:30,875
BUT I WOULD LOVE IT SO MUCH
IF YOU WOULD BE A PART OF IT.

411
00:21:30,917 --> 00:21:33,291
- GET OUT.

412
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:35,875
- SORRY.
DID I SAY SOMETHING WRONG?

413
00:21:35,917 --> 00:21:38,041
- GET OUT!

414
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:45,125
- WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM?

415
00:21:45,166 --> 00:21:46,458
DON'T GET MAD AT OPAL.

416
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:48,000
I ASKED HER TO TALK TO YOU

417
00:21:48,041 --> 00:21:49,333
BECAUSE I THOUGHT
IT WOULD HELP YOU

418
00:21:49,375 --> 00:21:51,041
SNAP OUT OF WHATEVER FUNK
YOU'RE IN,

419
00:21:51,083 --> 00:21:52,750
BUT I GUESS I WAS WRONG.

420
00:21:52,792 --> 00:21:54,375
- WHY DON'T YOU FOCUS
ON FIXING THE WORLD

421
00:21:54,417 --> 00:21:56,375
AND STOP TRYING
TO FIX MY FAMILY?

422
00:21:56,417 --> 00:21:59,875
- SU'S RIGHT.
YOU'RE NEVER GONNA CHANGE.

423
00:21:59,917 --> 00:22:02,709
YOU'RE ALWAYS GONNA BE
A BITTER, LONELY WOMAN.

424
00:22:06,208 --> 00:22:07,917
[door closes]
