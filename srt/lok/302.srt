1
00:00:07,625 --> 00:00:08,750
- EARTH.

2
00:00:08,792 --> 00:00:10,250
FIRE.

3
00:00:10,291 --> 00:00:12,542
AIR.

4
00:00:12,583 --> 00:00:14,500
WATER.

5
00:00:14,542 --> 00:00:18,667
ONLY THE AVATAR CAN MASTER
ALL FOUR ELEMENTS

6
00:00:18,709 --> 00:00:21,667
AND BRING BALANCE
TO THE WORLD.

7
00:00:21,709 --> 00:00:23,542
[dramatic music]

8
00:00:27,375 --> 00:00:29,291
- AFTER 170 YEARS,

9
00:00:29,333 --> 00:00:31,000
THERE ARE NEW AIRBENDERS
IN THE WORLD,

10
00:00:31,041 --> 00:00:32,333
AND BUMI IS ONE OF THEM.

11
00:00:32,375 --> 00:00:34,917
SO TOO IS
THE MYSTERIOUS ZAHEER,

12
00:00:34,959 --> 00:00:36,083
WHO ESCAPED FROM
HIS REMOTE PRISON

13
00:00:36,125 --> 00:00:38,125
THANKS TO HIS NEW ABILITY.

14
00:00:38,166 --> 00:00:40,333
NOW EXILED FROM REPUBLIC CITY,

15
00:00:40,375 --> 00:00:41,417
KORRA HAS MADE IT
HER MISSION

16
00:00:41,458 --> 00:00:43,417
TO FIND
ALL THE NEW AIRBENDERS.

17
00:00:43,458 --> 00:00:45,709
BUT WILL SHE AND TENZIN
BE ABLE TO BRING BACK

18
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:46,750
THE AIR NATION?

19
00:01:09,875 --> 00:01:11,625
- DID SOMEONE ORDER
A FULLY-EQUIPPED

20
00:01:11,667 --> 00:01:13,291
FUTURE INDUSTRIES AIRSHIP?

21
00:01:13,333 --> 00:01:15,875
- IT'S PERFECT.
THANKS, ASAMI.

22
00:01:15,917 --> 00:01:17,542
- I FIGURED IF WE'RE GOING
TO BA SING SE

23
00:01:17,583 --> 00:01:18,959
TO SEARCH FOR AIRBENDERS,

24
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,250
WE SHOULD DO IT IN STYLE.

25
00:01:20,291 --> 00:01:21,750
- YAY! AIRSHIP!

26
00:01:21,792 --> 00:01:22,917
- I WANNA SEE.

27
00:01:22,959 --> 00:01:24,834
- COME ON, POKI.

28
00:01:26,333 --> 00:01:27,583
- WHILE YOU GUYS ARE GONE,

29
00:01:27,625 --> 00:01:29,709
PEMA AND I WILL HOLD DOWN
THE FORT.

30
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:31,041
WHO'S EXCITED TO SPEND
SOME TIME

31
00:01:31,083 --> 00:01:34,166
WITH YOUR AUNTIE KYA?

32
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:35,333
OH.

33
00:01:35,375 --> 00:01:38,041
- AWW. HE LIKES YOU.

34
00:01:44,333 --> 00:01:45,750
- MAKO,
I'M SO GLAD YOU'RE HERE.

35
00:01:45,792 --> 00:01:48,250
- OF COURSE, KORRA.
AVATAR--

36
00:01:48,291 --> 00:01:50,250
AVATAR KORRA.

37
00:01:50,291 --> 00:01:51,667
ONCE I RECEIVED YOUR MESSAGE,

38
00:01:51,709 --> 00:01:53,583
I PROCEEDED TO CONTACT
VARIOUS LOCATIONS

39
00:01:53,625 --> 00:01:55,417
WITHIN THE EARTH KINGDOM
AS ORDERED BY YOU,

40
00:01:55,458 --> 00:01:57,333
THE AVATAR.

41
00:01:57,375 --> 00:01:58,917
- RIGHT.

42
00:01:58,959 --> 00:02:02,709
THE AVATAR THANKS YOU
FOR YOUR LOYAL SERVICE.

43
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:04,542
DID YOU FIND ANY MORE LEADS?

44
00:02:04,583 --> 00:02:06,417
- THERE ARE REPORTS
OF AIRBENDERS

45
00:02:06,458 --> 00:02:08,291
POPPING UP ALL OVER
THE EARTH KINGDOM.

46
00:02:08,333 --> 00:02:10,333
I MARKED THE VILLAGES
ON THIS MAP.

47
00:02:10,375 --> 00:02:13,709
YOU GUYS CAN TAKE IT WITH YOU.

48
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:17,041
- ACTUALLY, I WAS KIND OF HOPING
YOU COULD COME TOO.

49
00:02:17,083 --> 00:02:18,625
- REALLY?

50
00:02:18,667 --> 00:02:21,458
UM, IT'S PROBABLY BETTER
IF I SIT THIS ONE OUT.

51
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:23,709
- I KNOW THINGS HAVE BEEN WEIRD
BETWEEN US

52
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:26,417
SINCE WE BROKE UP, BUT
YOU'RE A PART OF TEAM AVATAR

53
00:02:26,458 --> 00:02:28,458
AND WE CAN'T DO THIS
WITHOUT YOU.

54
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:31,250
- I'M SORRY, I CAN'T.

55
00:02:33,333 --> 00:02:34,750
- I'LL MISS YOU, SWEETIE.

56
00:02:34,792 --> 00:02:36,166
[kisses]

57
00:02:36,208 --> 00:02:37,417
- I'LL MISS YOU TOO.

58
00:02:37,458 --> 00:02:39,875
ONCE WE FIND THE AIRBENDERS,
I'LL SEND WORD.

59
00:02:39,917 --> 00:02:42,542
YOU CAN JOIN US
AT THE NORTHERN AIR TEMPLE THEN.

60
00:02:42,583 --> 00:02:45,375
- HEY! HOW COME JINORA GETS
TO GO WITH YOU BUT WE DON'T?

61
00:02:45,417 --> 00:02:47,000
THAT'S SO NOT FAIR.

62
00:02:47,041 --> 00:02:49,458
- YEAH, WHAT THIS GIRL SAID.
NOT FAIR.

63
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:53,041
- BECAUSE IF AIRBENDERS
SHOW UP HERE,

64
00:02:53,083 --> 00:02:55,041
THEY'RE GOING TO NEED
SOME GUIDANCE FROM YOU TWO.

65
00:02:55,083 --> 00:02:56,667
IT'S A VERY IMPORTANT JOB.

66
00:02:56,709 --> 00:02:57,750
- REALLY?

67
00:02:57,792 --> 00:03:00,458
ME, A TEACHER?

68
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:01,625
YAY!

69
00:03:01,667 --> 00:03:03,959
- THOSE MAGGOTS WILL BOW TO ME.

70
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,333
- GO EASY ON THEM, SON.

71
00:03:06,375 --> 00:03:08,542
- MAKO, WAIT A SEC.

72
00:03:08,583 --> 00:03:11,000
- KORRA ALREADY ASKED, BRO.

73
00:03:11,041 --> 00:03:13,458
I CAN'T JUST LEAVE
REPUBLIC CITY.

74
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:15,333
I HAVE A LIFE HERE
AND A JOB.

75
00:03:15,375 --> 00:03:18,208
- A LIFE? YOU SLEEP UNDER
YOUR DESK.

76
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:20,333
AND WHAT'S
A MORE IMPORTANT JOB

77
00:03:20,375 --> 00:03:23,750
THAN HELPING THE AVATAR REBUILD
AN ENTIRE CIVILIZATION?

78
00:03:23,792 --> 00:03:25,834
- IT'S NOT JUST THAT.

79
00:03:25,875 --> 00:03:28,291
I FEEL LIKE I'VE BEEN
DRIFTING APART FROM EVERYONE.

80
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:31,125
- WELL, DRIFT BACK.
WE NEED YOU!

81
00:03:31,166 --> 00:03:33,959
COME ON, MAKO,
WE'RE GOING TO BA SING SE

82
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,458
WHERE DAD GREW UP.

83
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:38,834
WHAT IF I MEET OUR GRANDMA
FOR THE VERY FIRST TIME?

84
00:03:38,875 --> 00:03:42,375
AND SHE ASKS ME,
"WHERE'S YOUR SWEET BROTHER?"

85
00:03:42,417 --> 00:03:44,834
AND I HAVE TO SAY,
"I'M SORRY, GRANDMA.

86
00:03:44,875 --> 00:03:48,083
HE HAD SOME REALLY IMPORTANT
POLICE PAPERWORK TO FILE."

87
00:03:48,125 --> 00:03:50,208
AND SHE STARTS TO CRY
THOSE GRANDMA TEARS

88
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:52,625
AND IS LIKE, "MAKO! WHY?

89
00:03:52,667 --> 00:03:55,333
WHY, MAKO?
I CAN'T GO ON.

90
00:03:55,375 --> 00:03:57,500
I CAN'T--"
AND THEN SHE DIES.

91
00:03:57,542 --> 00:03:59,875
- OKAY, ALL RIGHT.
I'LL COME WITH YOU.

92
00:03:59,917 --> 00:04:03,125
[sighs]
I GUESS I GOTTA CALL BEIFONG.

93
00:04:03,166 --> 00:04:06,291
SHE'S NOT GOING
TO BE HAPPY.

94
00:04:06,333 --> 00:04:08,417
- BYE.
WE'LL MISS YOU.

95
00:04:11,875 --> 00:04:13,500
[Naga pants]

96
00:04:25,208 --> 00:04:26,166
- AS OF NOW,

97
00:04:26,208 --> 00:04:27,667
THESE ARE
THE TOWNS WHERE

98
00:04:27,709 --> 00:04:29,583
WE'VE GOTTEN REPORTS
ABOUT AIRBENDERS.

99
00:04:29,625 --> 00:04:31,250
IT LOOKS LIKE WE CAN HIT UP
MOST OF THEM

100
00:04:31,291 --> 00:04:33,375
BEFORE WE GET TO BA SING SE.

101
00:04:33,417 --> 00:04:35,083
- WE'RE GOING TO BRING
THE AIR NATION

102
00:04:35,125 --> 00:04:36,667
BACK FROM THE BRINK
OF EXTINCTION

103
00:04:36,709 --> 00:04:39,041
AFTER NEARLY 200 YEARS.

104
00:04:39,083 --> 00:04:42,041
- AND IT'S ALL
BECAUSE OF YOU, KORRA.

105
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:55,125
[wood creaks]

106
00:05:01,208 --> 00:05:04,083
- FINALLY, OUR SHIFT CHANGE
IS HERE.

107
00:05:10,959 --> 00:05:12,667
- HEY, WHERE ARE
THE OTHER GUARDS?

108
00:05:14,041 --> 00:05:15,917
ZAHEER?

109
00:05:17,709 --> 00:05:19,333
[men groaning]

110
00:05:37,917 --> 00:05:39,250
- [groans]

111
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:55,417
[men groan]

112
00:05:57,333 --> 00:05:58,208
- AAH!

113
00:06:00,792 --> 00:06:03,083
- IT'S NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN,
GHAZAN.

114
00:06:03,125 --> 00:06:05,166
- THANKS FOR BUSTING ME OUT.

115
00:06:05,208 --> 00:06:07,542
WHERE'D YOU PICK UP
THE NEW SKILLS?

116
00:06:07,583 --> 00:06:09,750
- I HAVE HARMONIC CONVERGENCE
TO THANK FOR THAT.

117
00:06:09,792 --> 00:06:11,625
I WAS GIVEN A GIFT.

118
00:06:11,667 --> 00:06:14,959
I BELIEVE IT'S A SIGN THAT
OUR PATH IS A RIGHTEOUS ONE.

119
00:06:18,542 --> 00:06:21,208
- AVATAR KORRA,
OH, IT IS SUCH AN HONOR

120
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:23,458
TO HAVE YOU COME
TO OUR HUMBLE VILLAGE.

121
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:25,166
- THANKS.

122
00:06:25,208 --> 00:06:28,250
- I HATE TO GET DOWN TO
BUSINESS, BUT IS THE AIRBENDER
HERE NOW?

123
00:06:28,291 --> 00:06:30,583
- KUON AND HIS FAMILY WILL BE
JOINING US SHORTLY

124
00:06:30,625 --> 00:06:32,041
FOR A SPECIAL DINNER.

125
00:06:32,083 --> 00:06:33,542
PLEASE, RIGHT THIS WAY.

126
00:06:35,417 --> 00:06:37,291
KUON HAS BEEN THE TALK
OF THE TOWN

127
00:06:37,333 --> 00:06:39,166
EVER SINCE HE GOT AIRBENDING.

128
00:06:39,208 --> 00:06:40,875
HE'S LIKE A LOCAL CELEBRITY.

129
00:06:40,917 --> 00:06:42,917
- I JUST WANT TO SAY
THAT IT'S AN HONOR

130
00:06:42,959 --> 00:06:45,208
TO MEET
A FELLOW AIRBENDER.

131
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:47,250
- OH, I STILL JUST THINK
OF MYSELF

132
00:06:47,291 --> 00:06:51,667
AS A SIMPLE FARMER...
WHO CAN AIRBEND.

133
00:06:51,709 --> 00:06:53,291
OH, I'M SO SORRY.

134
00:06:53,333 --> 00:06:54,875
I STILL DON'T HAVE
ANY CONTROL.

135
00:06:54,917 --> 00:06:57,917
- NO WORRIES.
I LOVE PIE.

136
00:06:57,959 --> 00:06:59,917
AND SO DOES PABU.

137
00:06:59,959 --> 00:07:02,750
- WELL, YOU'RE SO MUCH MORE
THAN JUST A FARMER NOW.

138
00:07:02,792 --> 00:07:05,417
HARMONIC CONVERGENCE
CHANGED EVERYTHING.

139
00:07:05,458 --> 00:07:07,625
YOU REPRESENT THE FUTURE
OF A CULTURE

140
00:07:07,667 --> 00:07:09,542
THAT IS BEING REBORN.

141
00:07:09,583 --> 00:07:12,083
YOU'RE GOING TO HELP US
REBUILD THE AIR NATION.

142
00:07:12,125 --> 00:07:14,208
- I'M GONNA DO WHAT NOW?

143
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:17,625
THE ONLY THING I'M PLANNING
TO REBUILD IS MY BARN.

144
00:07:17,667 --> 00:07:20,291
- BUT YOU MUST COME WITH US
TO THE NORTHERN AIR TEMPLE.

145
00:07:20,333 --> 00:07:21,709
- WELL, I CAN'T DO THAT.

146
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:23,875
I HAVE A FAMILY AND A FARM.

147
00:07:23,917 --> 00:07:25,208
- OF COURSE YOU CAN COME.

148
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:27,041
THIS IS OF
THE UTMOST IMPORTANCE!

149
00:07:27,083 --> 00:07:28,417
YOUR WIFE WILL UNDERSTAND.

150
00:07:28,458 --> 00:07:29,583
- WAIT, WHAT?

151
00:07:29,625 --> 00:07:31,834
NO, I DO NOT UNDERSTAND.

152
00:07:31,875 --> 00:07:33,625
- DADDY, WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

153
00:07:33,667 --> 00:07:36,000
WHY DOES THE BALD MAN
WANT TO TAKE YOU AWAY?

154
00:07:36,041 --> 00:07:38,291
- NO ONE'S GOING TO TAKE
DADDY AWAY, SWEETHEART.

155
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:41,208
- ACTUALLY, THIS BALD MAN
DOES WANT TO TAKE HIM,

156
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:42,750
BUT IT'S FOR
AN IMPORTANT CAUSE.

157
00:07:42,792 --> 00:07:44,542
YOUR DAD IS AN AIRBENDER,

158
00:07:44,583 --> 00:07:46,417
AND HE SHOULD LEARN
ABOUT HIS CULTURE.

159
00:07:46,458 --> 00:07:49,000
- I THINK THERE'S BEEN
SOME SORT OF MISUNDERSTANDING.

160
00:07:49,041 --> 00:07:50,500
I'M NOT GOING WITH YOU.

161
00:07:50,542 --> 00:07:52,667
I MIGHT BE ABLE TO AIRBEND,
BUT I'M NO AIR NOMAD!

162
00:07:52,709 --> 00:07:54,166
I'M NO MONK!

163
00:07:54,208 --> 00:07:57,000
- OKAY, UH, MAYBE WE SHOULD
JUST HAVE SOME DESSERT, HUH?

164
00:07:57,041 --> 00:07:58,291
WHO'S UP FOR DESSERT?

165
00:07:58,333 --> 00:08:00,500
- SIR, YOU MUST UNDERSTAND,

166
00:08:00,542 --> 00:08:02,166
YOU'RE AN AIRBENDER NOW,

167
00:08:02,208 --> 00:08:03,750
AND THERE ARE THOUSANDS
OF YEARS OF CULTURE

168
00:08:03,792 --> 00:08:04,750
YOU MUST LEARN ABOUT.

169
00:08:04,792 --> 00:08:06,542
SKILLS YOU MUST MASTER.

170
00:08:06,583 --> 00:08:10,333
- YOU EXPECT ME TO ABANDON
MY ENTIRE LIFE? MY FAMILY?

171
00:08:10,375 --> 00:08:12,125
NO! NO, SIR!

172
00:08:12,166 --> 00:08:13,625
I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE
WITH YOU

173
00:08:13,667 --> 00:08:15,375
AND I THINK IT'S BEST
THAT YOU LEAVE!

174
00:08:21,625 --> 00:08:25,208
- IN MY HEAD I SAW THAT
PLAYING OUT VERY DIFFERENTLY.

175
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:27,000
- MAYBE WE SHOULD HAVE STAYED
AND TRIED HARDER

176
00:08:27,041 --> 00:08:28,542
TO CONVINCE HIM TO JOIN US.

177
00:08:28,583 --> 00:08:30,208
- OR WE COULD'VE THROWN HIM
INTO A POTATO SACK

178
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:31,750
AND FORCED HIM INTO THE SHIP.

179
00:08:31,792 --> 00:08:34,709
- THAT'S HOW THEY GOT ME
TO JOIN THE UNITED FORCES.

180
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:36,458
- NO, WE CAN'T COERCE PEOPLE

181
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:38,542
OR THROW THEM IN POTATO SACKS.

182
00:08:38,583 --> 00:08:39,875
THEY MUST COME FREELY.

183
00:08:39,917 --> 00:08:41,333
BUT NOT TO WORRY,

184
00:08:41,375 --> 00:08:43,041
THERE ARE PLENTY
OF OTHER AIRBENDERS OUT THERE

185
00:08:43,083 --> 00:08:44,458
WHO WILL BE HAPPY TO COME
WITH US

186
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:46,542
ONCE THEY FIND OUT WHAT
THE AIR NATION'S ALL ABOUT.

187
00:08:49,291 --> 00:08:51,125
WHEN YOUR SON BECOMES
A MASTER,

188
00:08:51,166 --> 00:08:55,792
HE'LL GET TATTOOS ALL
OVER HIS BODY, JUST LIKE ME.

189
00:08:57,875 --> 00:09:02,417
THERE'S NOTHING MORE NUTRITIOUS
THAN OUR VEGETARIAN DIET.

190
00:09:04,291 --> 00:09:06,208
I CAN TELL THAT YOU'RE GOING
TO LOVE

191
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:08,792
WEARING
OUR ANCIENT AIRBENDER ROBES.

192
00:09:08,834 --> 00:09:11,291
THEY'RE VERY BREATHABLE.

193
00:09:13,375 --> 00:09:14,667
YOU'LL NEVER HAVE TO WORRY

194
00:09:14,709 --> 00:09:16,500
ABOUT YOUR
WORLDLY POSSESSIONS AGAIN

195
00:09:16,542 --> 00:09:18,542
BECAUSE YOU WON'T HAVE ANY.

196
00:09:18,583 --> 00:09:21,000
YOU'LL GET TO
SHAVE YOUR HEAD!

197
00:09:21,041 --> 00:09:23,417
YOUR BEST FRIEND
WILL BE A GIANT BISON!

198
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,458
[Pabu chirps]

199
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:29,917
- [groans]

200
00:09:29,959 --> 00:09:31,792
I REALLY THOUGHT
I HAD THAT LAST GUY.

201
00:09:31,834 --> 00:09:34,458
WHO DOESN'T WANT A BISON
AS THEIR BEST FRIEND?

202
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:35,959
- IT'S OKAY, TENZIN.

203
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,875
I STILL WANT TO BE
AN AIRBENDER.

204
00:09:37,917 --> 00:09:40,083
- OKAY, WE'VE TRIED IT YOUR WAY,

205
00:09:40,125 --> 00:09:42,000
AND PEOPLE JUST DON'T
SEEM TO BE RESPONDING.

206
00:09:42,041 --> 00:09:44,208
IT'S TIME FOR
A LITTLE TOUGH LOVE.

207
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:47,041
[knock on door]

208
00:09:47,083 --> 00:09:49,792
- OH, ARE YOU THE AVATAR?

209
00:09:49,834 --> 00:09:52,041
WHEN MY SON GOT AIRBENDING,

210
00:09:52,083 --> 00:09:54,000
MY HUSBAND AND I
WERE SO HAPPY.

211
00:09:54,041 --> 00:09:56,959
WE THOUGHT THIS COULD OPEN
A LOT OF DOORS FOR HIM.

212
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,375
AND MAYBE HE COULD FINALLY
MOVE OUT OF THE BASEMENT.

213
00:09:59,417 --> 00:10:01,917
[both laugh]

214
00:10:01,959 --> 00:10:03,000
- HOW OLD IS HE?

215
00:10:03,041 --> 00:10:05,291
- HE'S 22,
AND, YOU KNOW,

216
00:10:05,333 --> 00:10:07,583
STILL JUST FIGURING
HIS LIFE OUT.

217
00:10:07,625 --> 00:10:10,542
- WELL, I HAVE
A GREAT OPPORTUNITY FOR HIM.

218
00:10:10,583 --> 00:10:12,500
WE'RE LOOKING FOR AIRBENDERS
TO JOIN US

219
00:10:12,542 --> 00:10:13,792
AT THE NORTHERN AIR TEMPLE.

220
00:10:13,834 --> 00:10:15,458
- [squeals]

221
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:18,166
THAT SOUNDS WONDERFUL!
I'LL GET HIM.

222
00:10:18,208 --> 00:10:20,875
RYU, GET UP HERE!

223
00:10:27,834 --> 00:10:30,458
- HI, I'M KORRA.

224
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:33,917
- SO, YOU'RE LIKE THE AVATAR
OR SOMETHING? BIG DEAL.

225
00:10:33,959 --> 00:10:37,041
- AH, I JUST WANTED TO TALK
TO YOU

226
00:10:37,083 --> 00:10:38,333
ABOUT AN OPPORTUNITY--

227
00:10:38,375 --> 00:10:40,667
- YEAH, I HEARD YOU TALKING
TO MY MOM,

228
00:10:40,709 --> 00:10:41,917
AND I'M NOT INTERESTED.

229
00:10:41,959 --> 00:10:44,250
- WELL, YOU'RE GONNA BE
INTERESTED!

230
00:10:49,375 --> 00:10:51,417
YOU'RE AN AIRBENDER NOW,
AND YOU HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY

231
00:10:51,458 --> 00:10:53,000
AS A CITIZEN OF
THE WORLD.

232
00:10:53,041 --> 00:10:54,709
- WHATEVER.

233
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:56,917
I DIDN'T ASK TO BECOME
AN AIRBENDER, YOU KNOW.

234
00:10:56,959 --> 00:10:59,917
- WELL, I DIDN'T ASK
TO BE THE AVATAR,

235
00:10:59,959 --> 00:11:02,667
BUT I AM, AND I'M FULFILLING
MY DUTIES.

236
00:11:02,709 --> 00:11:04,709
- SO?
YOU DON'T HAVE TO.

237
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:06,625
- YES, I DO HAVE TO.

238
00:11:06,667 --> 00:11:07,834
- NO, YOU DON'T.

239
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:08,917
- YES, I DO.

240
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:11,291
- NO, YOU DON'T.

241
00:11:11,333 --> 00:11:14,000
- WELL, IF I DIDN'T EMBRACE
MY ROLE,

242
00:11:14,041 --> 00:11:16,542
THEN OUR ENTIRE WORLD
COULD BE THROWN INTO CHAOS.

243
00:11:16,583 --> 00:11:18,500
THINK ABOUT THAT.
IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT?

244
00:11:18,542 --> 00:11:21,083
- MAYBE.
- NO, IT'S NOT!

245
00:11:21,125 --> 00:11:22,291
- SO WHAT? WHO CARES?

246
00:11:22,333 --> 00:11:24,083
- EVERYONE CARES!

247
00:11:24,125 --> 00:11:25,125
- I DON'T CARE.

248
00:11:25,166 --> 00:11:27,166
- YES, YOU DO!

249
00:11:27,208 --> 00:11:28,583
- NO, I DON'T.

250
00:11:28,625 --> 00:11:29,834
- WELL, YOU'RE ABOUT TO CARE,
YOU LITTLE SLACKER,

251
00:11:29,875 --> 00:11:32,875
BECAUSE YOU'RE COMING
WITH ME!

252
00:11:32,917 --> 00:11:35,750
- STOP PULLING ON MY COLLAR,
YOU'RE STRETCHING IT OUT.

253
00:11:35,792 --> 00:11:38,250
MOM, ARE YOU JUST
GONNA JUST LET HER TAKE ME?

254
00:11:38,291 --> 00:11:40,750
- I THINK IT'S
A GREAT OPPORTUNITY.

255
00:11:40,792 --> 00:11:44,041
[laughs] JUST TRY IT FOR
A WEEK AND SEE HOW IT GOES.

256
00:11:44,083 --> 00:11:45,625
- NO! LET ME GO!

257
00:11:45,667 --> 00:11:46,834
- AAH!

258
00:11:46,875 --> 00:11:48,750
[groans]

259
00:11:48,792 --> 00:11:50,917
- THAT'S IT!

260
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:51,917
- KORRA, ENOUGH!

261
00:11:51,959 --> 00:11:53,458
LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.

262
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:56,667
- SO NICE TO MEET YOU.
GOOD LUCK WITH YOUR SON.

263
00:11:56,709 --> 00:11:58,542
- [groans]

264
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:18,041
- WE'RE UNDER ATTACK!

265
00:12:18,083 --> 00:12:19,500
- LOOK OUT!

266
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:24,875
- AAH!

267
00:12:26,625 --> 00:12:28,583
- AAH!

268
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:41,959
[men groan]

269
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:48,375
- OH!

270
00:12:55,417 --> 00:12:56,750
- WHOA!

271
00:12:56,792 --> 00:12:58,709
- [groans]

272
00:13:05,959 --> 00:13:08,083
- I NEVER THOUGHT
I'D BE SO HAPPY

273
00:13:08,125 --> 00:13:10,291
TO SEE YOUR UGLY MUGS AGAIN.

274
00:13:10,333 --> 00:13:12,792
- GREAT TO SEE YOU TOO,
MING-HUA.

275
00:13:12,834 --> 00:13:15,125
- I'M FLATTERED,
YOU BUSTED ME OUT

276
00:13:15,166 --> 00:13:17,041
BEFORE THAT GIRLFRIEND OF YOURS.

277
00:13:17,083 --> 00:13:19,458
- WE'RE GETTING HER NEXT.

278
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:22,208
- WELL, I GUESS WE SHOULD
JUST GO TO BA SING SE

279
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:23,917
AND TRY OUR LUCK THERE.

280
00:13:23,959 --> 00:13:25,083
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.

281
00:13:25,125 --> 00:13:26,959
I JUST THOUGHT MORE PEOPLE
WOULD BE EXCITED

282
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,333
ABOUT COMING WITH US.

283
00:13:28,375 --> 00:13:31,083
- WELL, MAYBE YOU GOTTA
DO MORE TO GET THEM EXCITED.

284
00:13:31,125 --> 00:13:33,583
YOU NEED TO ADD
A LITTLE RAZZLE DAZZLE.

285
00:13:33,625 --> 00:13:35,750
- YEAH, RAZZLE DAZZLE.

286
00:13:35,792 --> 00:13:39,000
WE COULD PUT ON SOME SORT OF
AIRBENDING STREET PERFORMANCE.

287
00:13:39,041 --> 00:13:42,000
- I WAS GOING TO SAY WE COULD
COVER TENZIN'S ROBE IN SEQUINS,

288
00:13:42,041 --> 00:13:44,500
BUT THAT'S EVEN BETTER.

289
00:13:44,542 --> 00:13:48,250
- IT SOUNDS RIDICULOUS,
BUT IT MIGHT WORK.

290
00:13:48,291 --> 00:13:50,792
- I'M WILLING TO TRY ANYTHING
AT THIS POINT.

291
00:13:50,834 --> 00:13:54,333
- YES! THAT IS THE KIND
OF ENTHUSIASM I LIKE TO HEAR.

00:14:14,041 --> 00:14:15,959
EVERY SINGLE DAY.

00:15:00,792 --> 00:15:04,291
WITH MY AIRBENDING SKILLS.

317
00:15:05,583 --> 00:15:06,750

EVEN THIS BEAST CAN FLOAT

326
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,750
LOOK WHAT CAN BE DONE IN ONLY
A FEW SHORT WEEKS OF PRACTICE.

327
00:15:28,792 --> 00:15:30,041
NO, NO, DON'T WORRY,
FOLKS,

328
00:15:30,083 --> 00:15:31,000
SHE MIGHT BE YOUNG,

349
00:16:21,917 --> 00:16:23,125
LET'S GO RIGHT NOW.

350
00:16:23,166 --> 00:16:25,083
- THIS IS GOING TO BE SO GREAT.

351
00:16:25,125 --> 00:16:27,625
YOU ARE GONNA LOVE IT--
UH, AH--

352
00:16:27,667 --> 00:16:28,625
REAL QUICK,
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

353
00:16:28,667 --> 00:16:31,625
- KAI. SO WHEN DO WE HIT
THE ROAD?

354
00:16:31,667 --> 00:16:34,500
- HANG ON A SECOND, KAI.
WHERE ARE YOUR PARENTS?

355
00:16:34,542 --> 00:16:36,583
WE CAN'T HAVE YOU COME WITH US
WITHOUT THEIR PERMISSION.

356
00:16:36,625 --> 00:16:39,917
- MY PARENTS ARE...GONE.

357
00:16:39,959 --> 00:16:42,375
- YOU'RE AN ORPHAN?

358
00:16:42,417 --> 00:16:44,875
- IT HAPPENED
ABOUT A YEAR AGO.

359
00:16:44,917 --> 00:16:47,500
MY HOMETOWN WAS RAIDED
BY OUTLAWS,

360
00:16:47,542 --> 00:16:49,625
BUT MY PARENTS
FOUGHT BACK AGAINST THEM.

361
00:16:49,667 --> 00:16:53,083
I WAS SO SCARED, BUT THEY
TOLD ME NOT TO WORRY.

362
00:16:53,125 --> 00:16:54,625
THEY WOULD PROTECT ME.

363
00:16:54,667 --> 00:16:56,542
AND THEY DID.

364
00:16:56,583 --> 00:16:59,208
MY PARENTS SAVED ME
AND THE ENTIRE VILLAGE.

365
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:01,375
BUT THEY DIED IN THE FIGHT.

366
00:17:01,417 --> 00:17:03,375
MOM AND POP MEANT
EVERYTHING TO ME.

367
00:17:03,417 --> 00:17:05,333
THEY WERE MY WHOLE LIFE.

368
00:17:05,375 --> 00:17:06,792
- [sniffles]

369
00:17:06,834 --> 00:17:08,750
- EVER SINCE THEN,
I'VE BEEN ON MY OWN

370
00:17:08,792 --> 00:17:10,166
AND ON THE RUN.

371
00:17:10,208 --> 00:17:12,583
THOSE SAME OUTLAWS
ARE STILL AFTER ME.

372
00:17:12,625 --> 00:17:15,000
- WELL, YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE
ON THE RUN ANYMORE.

373
00:17:15,041 --> 00:17:17,125
RIGHT, GUYS?
TELL HIM.

374
00:17:17,166 --> 00:17:19,917
- I'M SO SORRY
ABOUT YOUR PARENTS.

375
00:17:19,959 --> 00:17:22,542
I KNOW WE COULD NEVER
REPLACE THEM,

376
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:24,083
BUT WE'RE HERE FOR YOU.

377
00:17:24,125 --> 00:17:27,375
- WE'LL KEEP YOU SAFE.
COME ON.

378
00:17:27,417 --> 00:17:28,875
- WHEN YOU BOARD
THIS AIRSHIP,

379
00:17:28,917 --> 00:17:30,291
YOU'RE GONNA LEAVE
YOUR OLD LIFE BEHIND

380
00:17:30,333 --> 00:17:31,417
AND START A NEW PATH.

381
00:17:31,458 --> 00:17:33,417
THAT'S
SOME BIG BROTHER ADVICE.

382
00:17:33,458 --> 00:17:35,250
JUST THINK OF ME
AS YOUR BIG BROTHER.

383
00:17:44,417 --> 00:17:46,333
- GUYS, I THINK WE GOT TROUBLE.

384
00:17:48,208 --> 00:17:49,083
[wheels screech]

385
00:17:53,834 --> 00:17:56,875
- RELEASE THE BOY
OR WE'LL TAKE HIM BY FORCE.

386
00:18:00,375 --> 00:18:02,333
- THE OUTLAWS--
THEY'RE AFTER ME.

387
00:18:02,375 --> 00:18:03,417
LET'S GET OUT OF HERE!

388
00:18:03,458 --> 00:18:06,333
- WE'RE NOT RUNNING FROM ANYONE.

389
00:18:08,041 --> 00:18:10,709
IF YOU WANT KAI,
YOU'LL HAVE TO GO THROUGH ME!

390
00:18:15,917 --> 00:18:18,458
[men groan]

391
00:18:20,417 --> 00:18:23,166
- [grunts]

392
00:18:23,208 --> 00:18:24,291
[rock shatters]

393
00:18:26,458 --> 00:18:27,291
[groans]

394
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:32,166
- YOUR DAYS OF HARASSING
AN INNOCENT BOY ARE OVER.

395
00:18:32,208 --> 00:18:33,625
YOU OUTLAWS ARE GOING TO PRISON.

396
00:18:33,667 --> 00:18:34,750
- OUTLAWS?

397
00:18:34,792 --> 00:18:36,375
INNOCENT BOY?

398
00:18:36,417 --> 00:18:38,875
I'M A SHERIFF
AND THESE ARE MY DEPUTIES.

399
00:18:38,917 --> 00:18:40,500
AND THIS KID IS A THIEF.

400
00:18:40,542 --> 00:18:42,333
WHATEVER HE TOLD YOU IS A LIE.

401
00:18:42,375 --> 00:18:44,291
WE'VE BEEN CHASING HIM
FOR MONTHS.

402
00:18:44,333 --> 00:18:47,959
- WHERE'S KAI?

403
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,834
- RIGHT HERE.

404
00:18:49,875 --> 00:18:51,583
I FOUND HIM SLIPPING AWAY.

405
00:18:51,625 --> 00:18:53,583
- I WAS GOING TO THE BATHROOM.

406
00:18:53,625 --> 00:18:57,625
- WITH YOUR SACK OF GOLD?

407
00:18:57,667 --> 00:18:59,792
- I TOLD YOU,
I FOUND THAT ON THE ROAD!

408
00:18:59,834 --> 00:19:02,917
- ENOUGH WITH THE LIES, KID.
I WANT THE TRUTH.

409
00:19:02,959 --> 00:19:05,291
- THE TRUTH IS, HE'S THE OUTLAW.

410
00:19:05,333 --> 00:19:07,583
HE SPENT HIS ENTIRE LIFE
AS AN ORPHAN

411
00:19:07,625 --> 00:19:09,792
UNTIL HE GOT ADOPTED BY
A REAL NICE FAMILY

412
00:19:09,834 --> 00:19:11,083
ABOUT SIX MONTHS AGO.

413
00:19:11,125 --> 00:19:12,583
AND HOW DID HE REPAY THEM?

414
00:19:12,625 --> 00:19:15,166
BY TAKING THEIR ENTIRE
LIFE SAVINGS.

415
00:19:15,208 --> 00:19:16,417
WE'VE BEEN AFTER HIM
EVER SINCE.

416
00:19:16,458 --> 00:19:17,792
- IS THAT TRUE?

417
00:19:17,834 --> 00:19:20,375
- THE PERSON WHO STOLE
THAT STUFF WAS THE OLD ME.

418
00:19:20,417 --> 00:19:23,250
ONCE I GOT AIRBENDING,
I CHANGED.

419
00:19:23,291 --> 00:19:25,083
I DON'T KNOW
HOW TO EXPLAIN IT,

420
00:19:25,125 --> 00:19:27,917
BUT I FEEL LIKE AIRBENDING
CHOSE ME FOR A REASON.

421
00:19:27,959 --> 00:19:29,875
LIKE I'M A NEW PERSON.

422
00:19:29,917 --> 00:19:31,417
I'M SORRY! PLEASE!

423
00:19:31,458 --> 00:19:34,083
YOU HAVE TO LISTEN TO ME.

424
00:19:36,709 --> 00:19:39,083
- ARE YOU TAKING HIM BACK
TO THE ORPHANAGE?

425
00:19:39,125 --> 00:19:41,417
- NO. HE'S HEADED TO JAIL.

426
00:19:43,375 --> 00:19:44,792
- WAIT!

427
00:19:44,834 --> 00:19:47,583
YOU GUYS GOT
THE FAMILY'S LIFE SAVINGS BACK.

428
00:19:47,625 --> 00:19:49,333
NOW LET US TAKE KAI.

429
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:51,375
- DO YOU REALLY WANT
OUR FIRST NEW MEMBER

430
00:19:51,417 --> 00:19:54,291
OF THE AIR NATION
TO BE A LIAR AND A THIEF?

431
00:19:54,333 --> 00:19:56,667
- HE JUST NEEDS SOME GUIDANCE,
TENZIN.

432
00:19:56,709 --> 00:19:58,750
AND WHO BETTER TO GIVE IT
TO HIM THAN US?

433
00:19:58,792 --> 00:20:02,250
- DO YOU WANT THIS KID OR NOT?

434
00:20:02,291 --> 00:20:05,500
- YES. YOU CAN RELEASE
THE BOY INTO OUR CUSTODY.

435
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:10,291
- THANK YOU.

436
00:20:10,333 --> 00:20:12,208
- DON'T MAKE ME REGRET IT.

437
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:15,542
- WELCOME TO THE FAMILY,
LITTLE BRO.

438
00:20:22,166 --> 00:20:24,166
- I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW,

439
00:20:24,208 --> 00:20:25,375
I'M GOING TO BE
WATCHING YOU, KID.

440
00:20:25,417 --> 00:20:27,792
I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT
YOU'RE ALL ABOUT

441
00:20:27,834 --> 00:20:29,500
BECAUSE I'VE BEEN THERE BEFORE.

442
00:20:29,542 --> 00:20:30,875
YOU DON'T HAVE ME FOOLED.

443
00:20:30,917 --> 00:20:33,583
- WHOA, HEY, LIGHTEN UP.

444
00:20:33,625 --> 00:20:35,375
I'M TURNING OVER A NEW LEAF.

445
00:20:35,417 --> 00:20:37,000
MAKING A CHANGE.

446
00:20:37,041 --> 00:20:39,667
DON'T YOU WORRY ABOUT ME.

447
00:20:39,709 --> 00:20:41,750
- HI, I'M JINORA.

448
00:20:41,792 --> 00:20:43,417
IF YOU NEED ANY HELP
WITH AIRBENDING

449
00:20:43,458 --> 00:20:44,917
I COULD SHOW YOU WHAT I KNOW.

450
00:20:44,959 --> 00:20:47,375
- THANKS.
THAT'S REAL NICE OF YOU.

451
00:20:47,417 --> 00:20:50,291
- JINORA!
WE'RE LEAVING NOW.

452
00:21:06,709 --> 00:21:09,750
- THEY CAME OUT OF NOWHERE.
I'M SO SORRY, LORD ZUKO.

453
00:21:09,792 --> 00:21:12,125
- HOW COULD YOU LET THIS HAPPEN?

454
00:21:12,166 --> 00:21:14,291
- THEY CAUGHT US BY SURPRISE.

455
00:21:14,333 --> 00:21:16,834
AND ZAHEER IS
AN AIRBENDER NOW.

456
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:19,083
- NO!
THIS CAN'T BE.

457
00:21:19,125 --> 00:21:22,959
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA THE POWER
THESE CRIMINALS POSSESS?

458
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,458
INDIVIDUALLY, THEY CAN TAKE
DOWN ANY BENDER.

459
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:27,000
PUT THEM ALL TOGETHER,

460
00:21:27,041 --> 00:21:29,709
THEY COULD TAKE DOWN
THE ENTIRE WORLD.

461
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:32,959
AND NOW YOU'RE TELLING ME
THEIR LEADER IS AN AIRBENDER?

462
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,875
- WE CAN TRACK THEM...

463
00:21:34,917 --> 00:21:37,208
- WE DON'T NEED TO TRACK THEM.
I KNOW EXACTLY WHERE
THEY'RE GOING.

464
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:42,709
NOTIFY THE NEW CHIEFS OF
THE NORTHERN WATER TRIBE
THAT AN ATTACK ON THEIR PRISON
IS IMMINENT.

465
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:45,750
AND SEND WORD TO LIN BEIFONG
IN REPUBLIC CITY.

466
00:21:45,792 --> 00:21:50,458
THE AVATAR MUST BE PROTECTED.

467
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:52,333
- WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

468
00:21:52,375 --> 00:21:54,333
- TO STOP THEM.
