1
00:00:01,586 --> 00:00:02,795
- Tenzin: EARTH.

2
00:00:03,463 --> 00:00:04,589
FIRE.

3
00:00:05,215 --> 00:00:06,257
AIR.

4
00:00:06,925 --> 00:00:08,092
WATER.

5
00:00:09,093 --> 00:00:12,931
ONLY THE AVATAR
CAN MASTER ALL FOUR ELEMENTS

6
00:00:13,097 --> 00:00:15,266
AND BRING BALANCE
TO THE WORLD.

7
00:00:20,688 --> 00:00:23,233
- Man: AFTER 170 YEARS,

8
00:00:23,316 --> 00:00:25,151
THERE ARE NEW AIRBENDERS
IN THE WORLD,

9
00:00:25,235 --> 00:00:26,778
AND BUMI IS ONE OF THEM.

10
00:00:26,903 --> 00:00:29,072
SO TOO IS
THE MYSTERIOUS ZAHEER,

11
00:00:29,155 --> 00:00:30,740
WHO ESCAPED FROM
HIS REMOTE PRISON

12
00:00:30,823 --> 00:00:32,283
THANKS TO HIS NEW ABILITY.

13
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:34,369
NOW EXILED FROM REPUBLIC CITY,

14
00:00:34,452 --> 00:00:35,870
KORRA HAS MADE IT
HER MISSION

15
00:00:35,954 --> 00:00:37,747
TO FIND
ALL THE NEW AIRBENDERS.

16
00:00:37,997 --> 00:00:40,500
BUT WILL SHE AND TENZIN
BE ABLE TO BRING BACK THE AIR NATION?

17
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:05,817
DID SOMEONE ORDER
A FULLY-EQUIPPED

18
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:07,819
FUTURE INDUSTRIES AIRSHIP?

19
00:01:07,902 --> 00:01:09,821
IT'S PERFECT.
THANKS, ASAMI.

20
00:01:09,904 --> 00:01:11,864
I FIGURED IF WE'RE GOING
TO BA SING SE

21
00:01:11,948 --> 00:01:12,991
TO SEARCH FOR AIRBENDERS,

22
00:01:13,074 --> 00:01:14,617
WE SHOULD DO IT IN STYLE.

23
00:01:14,701 --> 00:01:16,244
- YAY! AIRSHIP!

24
00:01:16,452 --> 00:01:17,495
- I WANNA SEE.

25
00:01:17,579 --> 00:01:19,163
- COME ON, POKI.

26
00:01:20,915 --> 00:01:22,083
- WHILE YOU GUYS ARE GONE,

27
00:01:22,166 --> 00:01:23,960
PEMA AND I WILL HOLD DOWN
THE FORT.

28
00:01:24,043 --> 00:01:25,461
WHO'S EXCITED TO SPEND
SOME TIME

29
00:01:25,545 --> 00:01:26,588
WITH YOUR AUNTIE KYA?

30
00:01:28,089 --> 00:01:29,173
OH.

31
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:31,509
AWW. HE LIKES YOU.

32
00:01:38,057 --> 00:01:39,851
MAKO,
I'M SO GLAD YOU'RE HERE.

33
00:01:40,226 --> 00:01:41,978
OF COURSE, KORRA.
AVATAR...

34
00:01:42,729 --> 00:01:44,188
AVATAR KORRA.

35
00:01:44,689 --> 00:01:45,898
ONCE I RECEIVED YOUR MESSAGE,

36
00:01:45,982 --> 00:01:47,984
I PROCEEDED TO CONTACT
VARIOUS LOCATIONS

37
00:01:48,067 --> 00:01:50,028
WITHIN THE EARTH KINGDOM
AS ORDERED BY YOU,

38
00:01:50,194 --> 00:01:51,529
THE AVATAR.

39
00:01:52,363 --> 00:01:53,448
- RIGHT.

40
00:01:53,531 --> 00:01:56,451
THE AVATAR THANKS YOU
FOR YOUR LOYAL SERVICE.

41
00:01:57,493 --> 00:01:59,203
DID YOU FIND ANY MORE LEADS?

42
00:01:59,454 --> 00:02:00,663
THERE ARE REPORTS
OF AIRBENDERS

43
00:02:00,747 --> 00:02:02,707
POPPING UP ALL OVER
THE EARTH KINGDOM.

44
00:02:02,874 --> 00:02:04,667
I MARKED THE VILLAGES
ON THIS MAP.

45
00:02:04,751 --> 00:02:06,711
YOU GUYS CAN TAKE IT WITH YOU.

46
00:02:08,212 --> 00:02:11,132
ACTUALLY, I WAS KIND
OF HOPING YOU COULD COME, TOO.

47
00:02:11,799 --> 00:02:13,051
- REALLY?

48
00:02:13,426 --> 00:02:15,637
UM, IT'S PROBABLY BETTER
IF I SIT THIS ONE OUT.

49
00:02:16,346 --> 00:02:19,182
I KNOW THINGS HAVE BEEN WEIRD
BETWEEN US SINCE WE BROKE UP,

50
00:02:19,265 --> 00:02:20,642
BUT YOU'RE A PART
OF TEAM AVATAR

51
00:02:20,767 --> 00:02:22,560
AND WE CAN'T DO THIS
WITHOUT YOU.

52
00:02:22,894 --> 00:02:24,729
- I'M SORRY, I CAN'T.

53
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:29,400
- I'LL MISS YOU, SWEETIE.

54
00:02:30,735 --> 00:02:31,903
- I'LL MISS YOU, TOO.

55
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:34,238
ONCE WE FIND THE AIRBENDERS,
I'LL SEND WORD.

56
00:02:34,364 --> 00:02:36,449
YOU CAN JOIN US
AT THE NORTHERN AIR TEMPLE THEN.

57
00:02:36,824 --> 00:02:39,619
HEY! HOW COME JINORA GETS
TO GO WITH YOU BUT WE DON'T?

58
00:02:39,702 --> 00:02:41,245
THAT'S SO NOT FAIR.

59
00:02:41,329 --> 00:02:43,623
YEAH, WHAT THIS GIRL SAID.
NOT FAIR.

60
00:02:45,249 --> 00:02:47,210
BECAUSE IF AIRBENDERS
SHOW UP HERE,

61
00:02:47,293 --> 00:02:49,087
THEY'RE GOING TO NEED
SOME GUIDANCE FROM YOU TWO.

62
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:50,880
IT'S A VERY IMPORTANT JOB.

63
00:02:51,214 --> 00:02:52,340
- REALLY?

64
00:02:52,507 --> 00:02:54,008
ME, A TEACHER?

65
00:02:54,926 --> 00:02:55,968
YAY!

66
00:02:56,219 --> 00:02:58,137
THOSE MAGGOTS
WILL BOW TO ME.

67
00:02:58,763 --> 00:03:00,431
- GO EASY ON THEM, SON.

68
00:03:01,641 --> 00:03:03,059
- MAKO, WAIT A SEC.

69
00:03:03,142 --> 00:03:05,186
- KORRA ALREADY ASKED, BRO.

70
00:03:05,269 --> 00:03:07,105
I CAN'T JUST LEAVE
REPUBLIC CITY.

71
00:03:07,772 --> 00:03:09,982
I HAVE A LIFE HERE
AND A JOB.

72
00:03:10,066 --> 00:03:12,110
A LIFE? YOU SLEEP
UNDER YOUR DESK.

73
00:03:12,944 --> 00:03:14,320
AND WHAT'S
A MORE IMPORTANT JOB

74
00:03:14,404 --> 00:03:17,615
THAN HELPING THE AVATAR
REBUILD AN ENTIRE CIVILIZATION?

75
00:03:18,282 --> 00:03:19,659
- IT'S NOT JUST THAT.

76
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:22,537
I FEEL LIKE I'VE BEEN
DRIFTING APART FROM EVERYONE.

77
00:03:22,787 --> 00:03:25,206
WELL, DRIFT BACK.
WE NEED YOU!

78
00:03:25,832 --> 00:03:29,293
COME ON, MAKO, WE'RE GOING TO BA SING
SE WHERE DAD GREW UP.

79
00:03:29,711 --> 00:03:32,922
WHAT IF I MEET OUR GRANDMA
FOR THE VERY FIRST TIME?

80
00:03:33,131 --> 00:03:36,634
AND SHE ASKS ME,
"WHERE'S YOUR SWEET BROTHER?"

81
00:03:36,884 --> 00:03:38,970
AND I HAVE TO SAY,
"I'M SORRY, GRANDMA.

82
00:03:39,053 --> 00:03:42,181
"HE HAD SOME REALLY IMPORTANT
POLICE PAPERWORK TO FILE."

83
00:03:42,348 --> 00:03:44,559
AND SHE STARTS TO CRY
THOSE GRANDMA TEARS

84
00:03:44,642 --> 00:03:46,769
AND IS LIKE, "MAKO! WHY?

85
00:03:46,853 --> 00:03:49,772
"WHY, MAKO?
I CAN'T GO ON.

86
00:03:49,856 --> 00:03:51,190
"I CAN'T..."
AND THEN SHE DIES.

87
00:03:51,566 --> 00:03:53,860
OKAY, ALL RIGHT.
I'LL COME WITH YOU.

88
00:03:54,652 --> 00:03:57,155
I GUESS I GOTTA CALL BEIFONG.

89
00:03:57,613 --> 00:03:59,490
SHE'S NOT GOING
TO BE HAPPY.

90
00:04:00,491 --> 00:04:02,785
BYE.
WE'LL MISS YOU.

91
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:20,845
- AS OF NOW,

92
00:04:20,928 --> 00:04:22,180
THESE ARE
THE TOWNS WHERE

93
00:04:22,263 --> 00:04:23,931
WE'VE GOTTEN REPORTS
ABOUT AIRBENDERS.

94
00:04:24,015 --> 00:04:25,683
IT LOOKS LIKE WE CAN HIT UP
MOST OF THEM

95
00:04:25,767 --> 00:04:27,143
BEFORE WE GET TO BA SING SE.

96
00:04:27,685 --> 00:04:29,270
WE'RE GOING TO BRING
THE AIR NATION

97
00:04:29,353 --> 00:04:31,105
BACK FROM THE BRINK
OF EXTINCTION

98
00:04:31,189 --> 00:04:32,940
AFTER NEARLY 200 YEARS.

99
00:04:33,274 --> 00:04:35,526
AND IT'S ALL
BECAUSE OF YOU, KORRA.

100
00:04:55,671 --> 00:04:57,757
FINALLY, OUR SHIFT CHANGE
IS HERE.

101
00:05:04,722 --> 00:05:06,516
HEY, WHERE ARE
THE OTHER GUARDS?

102
00:05:08,392 --> 00:05:09,727
ZAHEER?

103
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:52,770
- AAH!

104
00:05:54,981 --> 00:05:57,066
IT'S NICE TO
SEE YOU AGAIN, GHAZAN.

105
00:05:57,441 --> 00:05:59,068
- THANKS FOR BUSTING ME OUT.

106
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:01,362
WHERE'D YOU PICK UP
THE NEW SKILLS?

107
00:06:01,571 --> 00:06:03,865
I HAVE HARMONIC CONVERGENCE
TO THANK FOR THAT.

108
00:06:04,323 --> 00:06:05,616
I WAS GIVEN A GIFT.

109
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:08,411
I BELIEVE IT'S A SIGN THAT
OUR PATH IS A RIGHTEOUS ONE.

110
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:15,126
AVATAR KORRA,
OH, IT IS SUCH AN HONOR

111
00:06:15,209 --> 00:06:17,587
TO HAVE YOU COME
TO OUR HUMBLE VILLAGE.

112
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:18,754
- THANKS.

113
00:06:18,838 --> 00:06:20,631
I HATE TO GET DOWN
TO BUSINESS,

114
00:06:20,756 --> 00:06:22,383
BUT IS
THE AIRBENDER HERE NOW?

115
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,802
KUON AND HIS FAMILY
WILL BE JOINING US SHORTLY

116
00:06:24,886 --> 00:06:26,220
FOR A SPECIAL DINNER.

117
00:06:26,304 --> 00:06:28,222
PLEASE, RIGHT THIS WAY.

118
00:06:30,016 --> 00:06:31,726
KUON HAS BEEN THE TALK
OF THE TOWN

119
00:06:31,809 --> 00:06:33,227
EVER SINCE
HE GOT AIRBENDING.

120
00:06:33,311 --> 00:06:35,062
HE'S LIKE A LOCAL CELEBRITY.

121
00:06:35,479 --> 00:06:37,565
I JUST WANT TO SAY
THAT IT'S AN HONOR

122
00:06:37,648 --> 00:06:39,150
TO MEET
A FELLOW AIRBENDER.

123
00:06:39,775 --> 00:06:41,569
OH, I STILL JUST THINK
OF MYSELF

124
00:06:41,652 --> 00:06:44,614
AS A SIMPLE FARMER...
WHO CAN AIRBEND.

125
00:06:45,656 --> 00:06:47,283
OH, I'M SO SORRY.

126
00:06:47,491 --> 00:06:48,951
I STILL DON'T HAVE
ANY CONTROL.

127
00:06:49,285 --> 00:06:50,870
NO WORRIES.
I LOVE PIE.

128
00:06:52,413 --> 00:06:54,040
AND SO DOES PABU.

129
00:06:54,415 --> 00:06:56,667
WELL, YOU'RE SO MUCH MORE
THAN JUST A FARMER NOW.

130
00:06:57,168 --> 00:06:59,295
HARMONIC CONVERGENCE
CHANGED EVERYTHING.

131
00:06:59,837 --> 00:07:01,797
YOU REPRESENT THE FUTURE
OF A CULTURE

132
00:07:01,881 --> 00:07:03,591
THAT IS BEING REBORN.

133
00:07:03,674 --> 00:07:06,010
YOU'RE GOING TO HELP US
REBUILD THE AIR NATION.

134
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:08,763
- I'M GONNA DO WHAT NOW?

135
00:07:08,846 --> 00:07:11,766
THE ONLY THING I'M PLANNING
TO REBUILD IS MY BARN.

136
00:07:11,849 --> 00:07:14,226
BUT YOU MUST COME WITH US
TO THE NORTHERN AIR TEMPLE.

137
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,937
- WELL, I CAN'T DO THAT.

138
00:07:16,103 --> 00:07:17,939
I HAVE A FAMILY AND A FARM.

139
00:07:18,022 --> 00:07:19,565
- OF COURSE YOU CAN COME.

140
00:07:19,649 --> 00:07:21,525
THIS IS OF
THE UTMOST IMPORTANCE!

141
00:07:21,651 --> 00:07:22,944
YOUR WIFE WILL UNDERSTAND.

142
00:07:23,027 --> 00:07:25,696
WAIT, WHAT?
NO, I DO NOT UNDERSTAND.

143
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,698
- DADDY, WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

144
00:07:28,032 --> 00:07:30,201
WHY DOES THE BALD MAN
WANT TO TAKE YOU AWAY?

145
00:07:30,451 --> 00:07:32,578
NO ONE'S GOING TO TAKE
DADDY AWAY, SWEETHEART.

146
00:07:32,703 --> 00:07:35,539
ACTUALLY, THIS BALD MAN
DOES WANT TO TAKE HIM,

147
00:07:35,623 --> 00:07:36,874
BUT IT'S FOR
AN IMPORTANT CAUSE.

148
00:07:37,541 --> 00:07:38,793
YOUR DAD IS AN AIRBENDER,

149
00:07:38,876 --> 00:07:40,962
AND HE SHOULD LEARN
ABOUT HIS CULTURE.

150
00:07:41,045 --> 00:07:43,130
I THINK THERE'S BEEN
SOME SORT OF MISUNDERSTANDING.

151
00:07:43,214 --> 00:07:44,632
I'M NOT GOING WITH YOU.

152
00:07:44,715 --> 00:07:46,926
I MIGHT BE ABLE TO AIRBEND,
BUT I'M NO AIR NOMAD!

153
00:07:47,051 --> 00:07:48,427
I'M NO MONK!

154
00:07:48,594 --> 00:07:51,180
OKAY, UH, MAYBE WE SHOULD JUST
HAVE SOME DESSERT, HUH?

155
00:07:51,263 --> 00:07:53,057
WHO'S UP FOR DESSERT?

156
00:07:53,265 --> 00:07:54,850
- SIR, YOU MUST UNDERSTAND,

157
00:07:55,101 --> 00:07:56,102
YOU'RE AN AIRBENDER NOW,

158
00:07:56,185 --> 00:07:58,938
AND THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF YEARS OF
CULTURE YOU MUST LEARN ABOUT.

159
00:07:59,021 --> 00:08:00,398
SKILLS YOU MUST MASTER.

160
00:08:00,815 --> 00:08:04,110
YOU EXPECT ME TO ABANDON
MY ENTIRE LIFE? MY FAMILY?

161
00:08:04,777 --> 00:08:06,153
NO! NO, SIR!

162
00:08:06,237 --> 00:08:08,030
I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE
WITH YOU

163
00:08:08,114 --> 00:08:10,449
AND I THINK IT'S BEST
THAT YOU LEAVE!

164
00:08:16,038 --> 00:08:19,208
IN MY HEAD I SAW THAT
PLAYING OUT VERY DIFFERENTLY.

165
00:08:19,375 --> 00:08:21,335
MAYBE WE SHOULD
HAVE STAYED AND TRIED HARDER

166
00:08:21,419 --> 00:08:22,670
TO CONVINCE HIM TO JOIN US.

167
00:08:22,753 --> 00:08:24,547
OR WE COULD'VE THROWN HIM
INTO A POTATO SACK

168
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:25,881
AND FORCED HIM INTO THE SHIP.

169
00:08:26,132 --> 00:08:28,843
THAT'S HOW THEY GOT ME
TO JOIN THE UNITED FORCES.

170
00:08:29,051 --> 00:08:30,594
- NO, WE CAN'T COERCE PEOPLE

171
00:08:30,928 --> 00:08:32,930
OR THROW THEM
IN POTATO SACKS.

172
00:08:33,055 --> 00:08:34,390
THEY MUST COME FREELY.

173
00:08:34,515 --> 00:08:35,558
BUT NOT TO WORRY,

174
00:08:35,641 --> 00:08:37,184
THERE ARE PLENTY
OF OTHER AIRBENDERS OUT THERE

175
00:08:37,268 --> 00:08:38,519
WHO WILL BE HAPPY
TO COME WITH US

176
00:08:38,602 --> 00:08:40,938
ONCE THEY FIND OUT WHAT
THE AIR NATION'S ALL ABOUT.

177
00:08:43,774 --> 00:08:45,192
WHEN YOUR SON
BECOMES A MASTER,

178
00:08:45,276 --> 00:08:48,237
HE'LL GET TATTOOS ALL
OVER HIS BODY, JUST LIKE ME.

179
00:08:52,324 --> 00:08:55,286
THERE'S NOTHING MORE
NUTRITIOUS THAN OUR VEGETARIAN DIET.

180
00:08:58,414 --> 00:09:00,416
I CAN TELL THAT
YOU'RE GOING TO LOVE

181
00:09:00,499 --> 00:09:02,960
WEARING
OUR ANCIENT AIRBENDER ROBES.

182
00:09:03,085 --> 00:09:04,462
THEY'RE VERY BREATHABLE.

183
00:09:07,798 --> 00:09:09,008
YOU'LL NEVER
HAVE TO WORRY

184
00:09:09,091 --> 00:09:10,885
ABOUT YOUR
WORLDLY POSSESSIONS AGAIN

185
00:09:11,052 --> 00:09:12,678
BECAUSE YOU WON'T HAVE ANY.

186
00:09:13,054 --> 00:09:14,638
YOU'LL GET TO
SHAVE YOUR HEAD!

187
00:09:15,181 --> 00:09:16,974
YOUR BEST FRIEND
WILL BE A GIANT BISON!

188
00:09:24,482 --> 00:09:26,525
I REALLY THOUGHT
I HAD THAT LAST GUY.

189
00:09:26,609 --> 00:09:28,569
WHO DOESN'T WANT A BISON
AS THEIR BEST FRIEND?

190
00:09:28,778 --> 00:09:30,071
- IT'S OKAY, TENZIN.

191
00:09:30,237 --> 00:09:31,989
I STILL WANT TO BE
AN AIRBENDER.

192
00:09:32,281 --> 00:09:34,241
OKAY, WE'VE
TRIED IT YOUR WAY,

193
00:09:34,325 --> 00:09:36,035
AND PEOPLE JUST DON'T
SEEM TO BE RESPONDING.

194
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:38,370
IT'S TIME FOR
A LITTLE TOUGH LOVE.

195
00:09:41,624 --> 00:09:43,709
- OH, ARE YOU THE AVATAR?

196
00:09:44,502 --> 00:09:46,212
WHEN MY SON GOT AIRBENDING,

197
00:09:46,295 --> 00:09:48,172
MY HUSBAND AND I
WERE SO HAPPY.

198
00:09:48,255 --> 00:09:51,467
WE THOUGHT THIS COULD OPEN
A LOT OF DOORS FOR HIM.

199
00:09:51,634 --> 00:09:53,761
AND MAYBE HE COULD FINALLY
MOVE OUT OF THE BASEMENT.

200
00:09:56,305 --> 00:09:57,515
- HOW OLD IS HE?

201
00:09:57,598 --> 00:09:59,391
HE'S 22,
AND, YOU KNOW,

202
00:09:59,517 --> 00:10:01,519
STILL JUST FIGURING
HIS LIFE OUT.

203
00:10:01,852 --> 00:10:04,730
WELL, I HAVE
A GREAT OPPORTUNITY FOR HIM.

204
00:10:04,897 --> 00:10:06,899
WE'RE LOOKING FOR AIRBENDERS
TO JOIN US

205
00:10:06,982 --> 00:10:08,859
AT THE NORTHERN AIR TEMPLE.

206
00:10:10,069 --> 00:10:12,446
THAT SOUNDS WONDERFUL!
I'LL GET HIM.

207
00:10:12,571 --> 00:10:14,281
RYU, GET UP HERE!

208
00:10:22,665 --> 00:10:24,250
- HI, I'M KORRA.

209
00:10:25,042 --> 00:10:27,837
SO, YOU'RE LIKE THE AVATAR
OR SOMETHING? BIG DEAL.

210
00:10:28,379 --> 00:10:31,298
AH, I JUST
WANTED TO TALK TO YOU

211
00:10:31,382 --> 00:10:32,967
ABOUT AN OPPORTUNITY...

212
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:34,927
YEAH, I HEARD YOU
TALKING TO MY MOM,

213
00:10:35,052 --> 00:10:36,679
AND I'M NOT INTERESTED.

214
00:10:37,513 --> 00:10:39,390
WELL, YOU'RE
GONNA BE INTERESTED!

215
00:10:43,435 --> 00:10:45,563
YOU'RE AN AIRBENDER NOW,
AND YOU HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY

216
00:10:45,646 --> 00:10:47,189
AS A CITIZEN OF
THE WORLD.

217
00:10:47,731 --> 00:10:48,732
- WHATEVER.

218
00:10:48,816 --> 00:10:50,901
I DIDN'T ASK TO BECOME
AN AIRBENDER, YOU KNOW.

219
00:10:51,318 --> 00:10:53,946
WELL, I DIDN'T ASK
TO BE THE AVATAR,

220
00:10:54,029 --> 00:10:56,782
BUT I AM, AND
I'M FULFILLING MY DUTIES.

221
00:10:57,283 --> 00:10:59,034
SO?
YOU DON'T HAVE TO.

222
00:10:59,118 --> 00:11:00,661
- YES, I DO HAVE TO.

223
00:11:01,245 --> 00:11:02,246
- NO, YOU DON'T.

224
00:11:02,329 --> 00:11:03,747
- YES, I DO.

225
00:11:04,415 --> 00:11:05,916
- NO, YOU DON'T.

226
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,085
WELL, IF I DIDN'T EMBRACE
MY ROLE,

227
00:11:08,169 --> 00:11:10,337
THEN OUR ENTIRE WORLD
COULD BE THROWN INTO CHAOS.

228
00:11:10,421 --> 00:11:12,590
THINK ABOUT THAT.
IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT?

229
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:14,967
- MAYBE.
- NO, IT'S NOT!

230
00:11:15,593 --> 00:11:16,927
- SO WHAT? WHO CARES?

231
00:11:17,052 --> 00:11:18,345
- EVERYONE CARES!

232
00:11:18,846 --> 00:11:21,056
- I DON'T CARE.
- YES, YOU DO!

233
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:22,433
- NO, I DON'T.

234
00:11:22,725 --> 00:11:24,351
WELL, YOU'RE ABOUT TO CARE,
YOU LITTLE SLACKER,

235
00:11:24,435 --> 00:11:26,228
BECAUSE YOU'RE
COMING WITH ME!

236
00:11:27,438 --> 00:11:30,107
STOP PULLING ON MY COLLAR,
YOU'RE STRETCHING IT OUT.

237
00:11:30,232 --> 00:11:32,401
MOM, ARE YOU JUST
GONNA LET HER TAKE ME?

238
00:11:32,610 --> 00:11:34,904
I THINK IT'S
A GREAT OPPORTUNITY.

239
00:11:35,321 --> 00:11:37,907
JUST TRY IT FOR
A WEEK AND SEE HOW IT GOES.

240
00:11:38,449 --> 00:11:40,034
- NO! LET ME GO!

241
00:11:40,117 --> 00:11:41,368
- AAH!

242
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:44,747
- THAT'S IT!

243
00:11:44,830 --> 00:11:45,998
- KORRA, ENOUGH!

244
00:11:46,498 --> 00:11:47,833
LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.

245
00:11:47,917 --> 00:11:50,002
SO NICE TO MEET YOU.
GOOD LUCK WITH YOUR SON.

246
00:12:11,357 --> 00:12:13,150
- WE'RE UNDER ATTACK!
- LOOK OUT!

247
00:12:17,446 --> 00:12:18,656
- AAH!

248
00:12:21,575 --> 00:12:22,826
- AAH!

249
00:12:41,804 --> 00:12:43,222
- OH!

250
00:12:50,229 --> 00:12:51,230
- WHOA!

251
00:13:01,115 --> 00:13:02,324
I NEVER THOUGHT
I'D BE SO HAPPY

252
00:13:02,449 --> 00:13:04,285
TO SEE YOUR
UGLY MUGS AGAIN.

253
00:13:04,368 --> 00:13:06,704
GREAT TO SEE YOU TOO,
MING-HUA.

254
00:13:07,538 --> 00:13:09,331
I'M FLATTERED,
YOU BUSTED ME OUT

255
00:13:09,415 --> 00:13:11,208
BEFORE THAT
GIRLFRIEND OF YOURS.

256
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:13,168
- WE'RE GETTING HER NEXT.

257
00:13:14,253 --> 00:13:16,505
WELL, I GUESS WE SHOULD
JUST GO TO BA SING SE

258
00:13:16,588 --> 00:13:18,048
AND TRY OUR LUCK THERE.

259
00:13:18,132 --> 00:13:19,591
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO DO.

260
00:13:19,675 --> 00:13:21,260
I JUST THOUGHT
MORE PEOPLE WOULD BE EXCITED

261
00:13:21,343 --> 00:13:22,803
ABOUT COMING WITH US.

262
00:13:22,886 --> 00:13:25,431
WELL, MAYBE YOU GOTTA
DO MORE TO GET THEM EXCITED.

263
00:13:25,514 --> 00:13:27,766
YOU NEED TO ADD
A LITTLE RAZZLE DAZZLE.

264
00:13:28,058 --> 00:13:29,810
- YEAH, RAZZLE DAZZLE.

265
00:13:29,935 --> 00:13:33,022
WE COULD PUT ON SOME SORT OF
AIRBENDING STREET PERFORMANCE.

266
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:34,481
I WAS GOING TO
SAY WE COULD

267
00:13:34,565 --> 00:13:36,150
COVER TENZIN'S ROBE
IN SEQUINS,

268
00:13:36,233 --> 00:13:37,818
BUT THAT'S EVEN BETTER.

269
00:13:39,236 --> 00:13:42,197
IT SOUNDS RIDICULOUS,
BUT IT MIGHT WORK.

270
00:13:42,781 --> 00:13:44,658
I'M WILLING TO TRY ANYTHING
AT THIS POINT.

271
00:13:45,117 --> 00:13:48,329
YES! THAT IS THE KIND
OF ENTHUSIASM I LIKE TO HEAR.

272
00:13:51,081 --> 00:13:55,502
COME ONE, COME ALL
AND WITNESS THE AMAZING AIRBENDERS!

273
00:13:56,086 --> 00:14:00,341
AN AIRBENDING SHOW THAT WILL LEAVE
YOU BREATHLESS WITH WIND!

274
00:14:00,841 --> 00:14:03,844
FIRST UP,
THE TATTOOED MASTER HIMSELF.

275
00:14:04,053 --> 00:14:06,555
YOU KNOW HIM AS THE SON
OF AVATAR AANG.

276
00:14:06,764 --> 00:14:08,515
HE SHAVES EVERY HAIR
ON HIS HEAD

277
00:14:08,599 --> 00:14:10,017
EVERY SINGLE DAY.

278
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:11,810
IT'S THE ONE,
THE ONLY GUY

279
00:14:12,436 --> 00:14:14,605
WITH AN ARROW POINTING
TO HIS NOSE...

280
00:14:14,813 --> 00:14:16,148
TENZIN!

281
00:14:26,241 --> 00:14:27,451
NOW, NOW,
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,

282
00:14:27,534 --> 00:14:28,786
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
PLEASE BE QUIET.

283
00:14:28,869 --> 00:14:30,329
I HAVE SOME SERIOUS NEWS.

284
00:14:30,579 --> 00:14:33,040
WE'VE HEARD THAT
AN ESCAPED FIREBENDING CONVICT

285
00:14:33,123 --> 00:14:34,666
HAS BEEN SPOTTED NEAR HERE.

286
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:36,251
NOW, I DON'T WANT
TO PANIC ANYONE,

287
00:14:36,335 --> 00:14:40,756
BUT IF YOU SEE A FIREBENDER
WITH A RED SCARF...

288
00:14:41,048 --> 00:14:42,549
I SEE HIM.
HE'S RIGHT THERE!

289
00:14:43,801 --> 00:14:45,427
I AM THE ESCAPED CONVICT,

290
00:14:45,511 --> 00:14:48,263
AND YOU WILL ALL REAP MY FIRE.

291
00:14:51,558 --> 00:14:53,727
OH, NO,
WHO WILL HELP US?

292
00:14:54,019 --> 00:14:55,187
- I WILL!

293
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:57,064
WITH MY AIRBENDING SKILLS.

294
00:15:00,025 --> 00:15:01,318
- WHOA! AAH!

295
00:15:01,402 --> 00:15:03,320
OH! AAH! AAH!

296
00:15:03,529 --> 00:15:05,239
HEY! LET ME GO!

297
00:15:05,364 --> 00:15:07,491
THIS IS NOT WHAT
WE REHEARSED!

298
00:15:07,699 --> 00:15:08,659
KORRA!

299
00:15:11,703 --> 00:15:13,455
WITH THE POWER
OF AIRBENDING,

300
00:15:13,539 --> 00:15:16,500
EVEN THIS BEAST CAN FLOAT
LIKE A FEATHER!

301
00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:21,422
LOOK WHAT CAN BE DONE IN ONLY
A FEW SHORT WEEKS OF PRACTICE.

302
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:24,341
NO, NO,
DON'T WORRY, FOLKS,

303
00:15:24,425 --> 00:15:25,342
SHE MIGHT BE YOUNG,

304
00:15:25,426 --> 00:15:27,302
BUT SHE IS IN FULL CONTROL.

305
00:15:29,638 --> 00:15:31,014
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,

306
00:15:31,098 --> 00:15:33,434
IF YOU OR ANYONE
YOU KNOW IS AN AIRBENDER,

307
00:15:33,517 --> 00:15:35,185
PLEASE SEND THEM OUR WAY.

308
00:15:35,269 --> 00:15:37,938
MASTER TENZIN AND AVATAR KORRA
WOULD LOVE TO TEACH THEM

309
00:15:38,021 --> 00:15:39,273
ALL THEY KNOW.

310
00:15:45,154 --> 00:15:46,697
HEY.
HELLO.

311
00:15:46,905 --> 00:15:48,323
IF YOU'RE LOOKING
FOR AIRBENDERS,

312
00:15:48,407 --> 00:15:49,700
YOU JUST FOUND ONE.

313
00:15:52,828 --> 00:15:54,204
I WANT TO JOIN YOU GUYS.

314
00:15:55,330 --> 00:15:56,457
- GET OUTTA TOWN!

315
00:15:57,332 --> 00:15:59,293
- WE GOT OUR FIRST RECRUIT.

316
00:16:02,588 --> 00:16:04,298
JUST TO BE
TOTALLY CLEAR,

317
00:16:04,381 --> 00:16:05,966
WE'RE GOING TO BE HEADING
TO BA SING SE,

318
00:16:06,049 --> 00:16:08,302
THEN THE NORTHERN AIR TEMPLE
TO LIVE AS NOMADS

319
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:10,304
AND REBUILD THE AIR NATION.

320
00:16:10,387 --> 00:16:11,972
ALL THAT SOUND GOOD TO YOU?

321
00:16:12,181 --> 00:16:13,765
YEAH, BA SING SE,
REBUILD THE TEMPLE,

322
00:16:13,849 --> 00:16:15,893
AIR NOMAD
WHADDYADO... I'M IN.

323
00:16:16,226 --> 00:16:17,394
LET'S GO RIGHT NOW.

324
00:16:17,936 --> 00:16:19,438
THIS IS GOING
TO BE SO GREAT.

325
00:16:19,563 --> 00:16:21,815
YOU ARE GONNA LOVE IT...
UH, AH...

326
00:16:21,899 --> 00:16:23,150
REAL QUICK,
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

327
00:16:23,233 --> 00:16:25,569
KAI. SO WHEN DO WE HIT
THE ROAD?

328
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:28,238
HANG ON A SECOND, KAI.
WHERE ARE YOUR PARENTS?

329
00:16:28,864 --> 00:16:30,949
WE CAN'T HAVE YOU COME WITH US
WITHOUT THEIR PERMISSION.

330
00:16:31,074 --> 00:16:33,744
- MY PARENTS ARE...GONE.

331
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,997
- YOU'RE AN ORPHAN?

332
00:16:37,706 --> 00:16:39,166
IT HAPPENED
ABOUT A YEAR AGO.

333
00:16:39,708 --> 00:16:41,668
MY HOMETOWN WAS RAIDED
BY OUTLAWS,

334
00:16:42,085 --> 00:16:43,754
BUT MY PARENTS
FOUGHT BACK AGAINST THEM.

335
00:16:44,213 --> 00:16:47,090
I WAS SO SCARED,
BUT THEY TOLD ME NOT TO WORRY.

336
00:16:47,674 --> 00:16:49,259
THEY WOULD PROTECT ME.

337
00:16:49,551 --> 00:16:50,552
AND THEY DID.

338
00:16:50,928 --> 00:16:53,430
MY PARENTS SAVED ME
AND THE ENTIRE VILLAGE.

339
00:16:53,597 --> 00:16:55,390
BUT THEY DIED IN THE FIGHT.

340
00:16:55,933 --> 00:16:57,559
MOM AND POP MEANT
EVERYTHING TO ME.

341
00:16:58,018 --> 00:16:59,436
THEY WERE MY WHOLE LIFE.

342
00:17:01,396 --> 00:17:04,107
EVER SINCE THEN,
I'VE BEEN ON MY OWN AND ON THE RUN.

343
00:17:04,441 --> 00:17:06,443
THOSE SAME OUTLAWS
ARE STILL AFTER ME.

344
00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:09,530
WELL, YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE
ON THE RUN ANYMORE.

345
00:17:09,613 --> 00:17:11,198
RIGHT, GUYS?
TELL HIM.

346
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:13,909
I'M SO SORRY
ABOUT YOUR PARENTS.

347
00:17:14,618 --> 00:17:16,453
I KNOW WE COULD NEVER
REPLACE THEM,

348
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:18,247
BUT WE'RE HERE FOR YOU.

349
00:17:18,330 --> 00:17:20,082
WE'LL KEEP YOU SAFE.
COME ON.

350
00:17:21,625 --> 00:17:23,210
WHEN YOU BOARD
THIS AIRSHIP,

351
00:17:23,293 --> 00:17:25,796
YOU'RE GONNA LEAVE YOUR OLD LIFE
BEHIND AND START A NEW PATH.

352
00:17:26,213 --> 00:17:28,048
THAT'S SOME
BIG BROTHER ADVICE.

353
00:17:28,131 --> 00:17:30,133
JUST THINK OF ME
AS YOUR BIG BROTHER.

354
00:17:38,809 --> 00:17:40,811
GUYS, I THINK
WE GOT TROUBLE.

355
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:51,196
RELEASE THE BOY
OR WE'LL TAKE HIM BY FORCE.

356
00:17:54,575 --> 00:17:56,451
THE OUTLAWS...
THEY'RE AFTER ME.

357
00:17:56,535 --> 00:17:57,869
LET'S GET OUT OF HERE!

358
00:17:57,953 --> 00:17:59,621
WE'RE NOT RUNNING
FROM ANYONE.

359
00:18:02,249 --> 00:18:04,668
IF YOU WANT KAI,
YOU'LL HAVE TO GO THROUGH ME!

360
00:18:24,021 --> 00:18:26,440
YOUR DAYS OF HARASSING
AN INNOCENT BOY ARE OVER.

361
00:18:26,523 --> 00:18:28,108
YOU OUTLAWS
ARE GOING TO PRISON.

362
00:18:28,191 --> 00:18:29,526
- OUTLAWS?

363
00:18:29,693 --> 00:18:30,902
INNOCENT BOY?

364
00:18:30,986 --> 00:18:33,322
I'M A SHERIFF
AND THESE ARE MY DEPUTIES.

365
00:18:33,405 --> 00:18:34,990
AND THIS KID IS A THIEF.

366
00:18:35,073 --> 00:18:36,783
WHATEVER HE TOLD YOU IS A LIE.

367
00:18:36,867 --> 00:18:39,036
WE'VE BEEN CHASING HIM
FOR MONTHS.

368
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:41,872
- WHERE'S KAI?

369
00:18:42,289 --> 00:18:43,749
- RIGHT HERE.

370
00:18:44,374 --> 00:18:46,251
I FOUND HIM SLIPPING AWAY.

371
00:18:46,335 --> 00:18:47,878
- I WAS GOING TO THE BATHROOM.

372
00:18:48,003 --> 00:18:49,588
- WITH YOUR SACK OF GOLD?

373
00:18:52,049 --> 00:18:54,301
I TOLD YOU,
I FOUND THAT ON THE ROAD!

374
00:18:54,384 --> 00:18:56,887
ENOUGH WITH THE LIES, KID.
I WANT THE TRUTH.

375
00:18:57,220 --> 00:18:59,556
THE TRUTH IS,
HE'S THE OUTLAW.

376
00:18:59,723 --> 00:19:01,642
HE SPENT HIS ENTIRE LIFE
AS AN ORPHAN

377
00:19:01,725 --> 00:19:05,062
UNTIL HE GOT ADOPTED BY A REAL NICE
FAMILY ABOUT SIX MONTHS AGO.

378
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,022
AND HOW DID HE REPAY THEM?

379
00:19:07,105 --> 00:19:09,399
BY TAKING THEIR
ENTIRE LIFE SAVINGS.

380
00:19:09,524 --> 00:19:11,068
WE'VE BEEN
AFTER HIM EVER SINCE.

381
00:19:11,193 --> 00:19:12,319
- IS THAT TRUE?

382
00:19:12,402 --> 00:19:14,821
THE PERSON WHO STOLE
THAT STUFF WAS THE OLD ME.

383
00:19:15,072 --> 00:19:17,282
ONCE I GOT
AIRBENDING, I CHANGED.

384
00:19:17,741 --> 00:19:19,159
I DON'T KNOW
HOW TO EXPLAIN IT,

385
00:19:19,368 --> 00:19:22,162
BUT I FEEL LIKE AIRBENDING
CHOSE ME FOR A REASON.

386
00:19:22,245 --> 00:19:23,914
LIKE I'M A NEW PERSON.

387
00:19:24,498 --> 00:19:25,749
I'M SORRY! PLEASE!

388
00:19:25,832 --> 00:19:27,417
YOU HAVE TO LISTEN TO ME.

389
00:19:31,213 --> 00:19:33,715
ARE YOU TAKING HIM
BACK TO THE ORPHANAGE?

390
00:19:33,799 --> 00:19:35,676
- NO. HE'S HEADED TO JAIL.

391
00:19:37,803 --> 00:19:38,929
- WAIT!

392
00:19:39,721 --> 00:19:41,723
YOU GUYS GOT
THE FAMILY'S LIFE SAVINGS BACK.

393
00:19:42,182 --> 00:19:43,475
NOW LET US TAKE KAI.

394
00:19:43,725 --> 00:19:45,519
DO YOU REALLY WANT
OUR FIRST NEW MEMBER

395
00:19:45,602 --> 00:19:48,355
OF THE AIR NATION
TO BE A LIAR AND A THIEF?

396
00:19:48,814 --> 00:19:50,857
HE JUST NEEDS
SOME GUIDANCE, TENZIN.

397
00:19:50,941 --> 00:19:51,942
AND WHO BETTER
TO GIVE IT

398
00:19:52,025 --> 00:19:53,193
TO HIM THAN US?

399
00:19:53,276 --> 00:19:54,903
- DO YOU WANT THIS KID OR NOT?

400
00:19:56,613 --> 00:19:59,491
YES. YOU CAN RELEASE
THE BOY INTO OUR CUSTODY.

401
00:20:03,078 --> 00:20:04,454
- THANK YOU.

402
00:20:04,996 --> 00:20:06,415
- DON'T MAKE ME REGRET IT.

403
00:20:06,665 --> 00:20:08,834
WELCOME TO
THE FAMILY, LITTLE BRO.

404
00:20:16,842 --> 00:20:18,135
- I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW,

405
00:20:18,301 --> 00:20:19,845
I'M GOING TO BE
WATCHING YOU, KID.

406
00:20:20,178 --> 00:20:22,013
I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT
YOU'RE ALL ABOUT

407
00:20:22,097 --> 00:20:23,640
BECAUSE I'VE BEEN
THERE BEFORE.

408
00:20:23,807 --> 00:20:25,350
YOU DON'T HAVE ME FOOLED.

409
00:20:25,642 --> 00:20:27,769
- WHOA, HEY, LIGHTEN UP.

410
00:20:28,228 --> 00:20:29,730
I'M TURNING OVER A NEW LEAF.

411
00:20:29,938 --> 00:20:31,523
MAKING A CHANGE.

412
00:20:31,815 --> 00:20:33,275
DON'T YOU WORRY ABOUT ME.

413
00:20:33,734 --> 00:20:35,819
- HI, I'M JINORA.

414
00:20:36,111 --> 00:20:37,904
IF YOU NEED ANY HELP
WITH AIRBENDING

415
00:20:37,988 --> 00:20:39,239
I COULD SHOW YOU
WHAT I KNOW.

416
00:20:39,489 --> 00:20:41,491
THANKS.
THAT'S REAL NICE OF YOU.

417
00:20:41,825 --> 00:20:44,035
JINORA!
WE'RE LEAVING NOW.

418
00:21:01,344 --> 00:21:03,889
THEY CAME OUT
OF NOWHERE. I'M SO SORRY, LORD ZUKO.

419
00:21:04,556 --> 00:21:06,433
HOW COULD YOU
LET THIS HAPPEN?

420
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,435
THEY CAUGHT US
BY SURPRISE.

421
00:21:08,602 --> 00:21:10,604
AND ZAHEER IS
AN AIRBENDER NOW.

422
00:21:10,687 --> 00:21:13,023
NO!
THIS CAN'T BE.

423
00:21:13,356 --> 00:21:16,860
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
THE POWER THESE CRIMINALS POSSESS?

424
00:21:17,194 --> 00:21:19,696
INDIVIDUALLY, THEY CAN TAKE
DOWN ANY BENDER.

425
00:21:20,113 --> 00:21:21,448
PUT THEM ALL TOGETHER,

426
00:21:21,531 --> 00:21:23,658
THEY COULD TAKE DOWN
THE ENTIRE WORLD.

427
00:21:23,867 --> 00:21:26,953
AND NOW YOU'RE TELLING ME
THEIR LEADER IS AN AIRBENDER?

428
00:21:27,245 --> 00:21:28,246
- WE CAN TRACK THEM...

429
00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:29,706
- WE DON'T NEED TO TRACK THEM.

430
00:21:29,790 --> 00:21:31,666
I KNOW EXACTLY WHERE
THEY'RE GOING.

431
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:34,294
NOTIFY THE NEW CHIEFS OF
THE NORTHERN WATER TRIBE

432
00:21:34,377 --> 00:21:36,755
THAT AN ATTACK ON
THEIR PRISON IS IMMINENT.

433
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:39,758
AND SEND WORD TO LIN BEIFONG
IN REPUBLIC CITY.

434
00:21:40,217 --> 00:21:42,385
THE AVATAR MUST BE PROTECTED.

435
00:21:44,930 --> 00:21:46,473
- WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

436
00:21:46,556 --> 00:21:48,016
- TO STOP THEM.
