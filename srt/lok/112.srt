1
00:00:01,459 --> 00:00:03,335
Earth.

2
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:04,920
Fire.

3
00:00:05,005 --> 00:00:06,755
Air.

4
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:08,882
Water.

5
00:00:08,967 --> 00:00:12,970
Only the Avatar can master
all four elements

6
00:00:12,971 --> 00:00:15,764
and bring baIance to the world.

7
00:00:20,979 --> 00:00:24,606
Korra and Mako have discovered
the truth about Amon's identity.

8
00:00:24,691 --> 00:00:28,110
He's a Waterbender, a Bloodbender
and brother to Tarrlok.

9
00:00:28,194 --> 00:00:31,739
Now, Korra and Mako pIan
to infiItrate the EquaIist victory raIIy

10
00:00:31,823 --> 00:00:33,407
and expose Amon as a fraud.

11
00:00:33,491 --> 00:00:35,909
Meanwhile,
Asami, Bolin and General lroh

12
00:00:35,994 --> 00:00:37,995
head towards Hiroshi's secret airfield,

13
00:00:37,996 --> 00:00:41,040
where Asami
intends to take down her father.

14
00:00:57,307 --> 00:00:59,600
l think we found our secret airfield.

15
00:00:59,684 --> 00:01:03,979
Bolin, once we get down there,
l need you to tear up those runways.

16
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:07,024
-We can't let those aircraft take off.
-Aye-aye, Captain.

17
00:01:07,025 --> 00:01:09,026
General. General.

18
00:01:11,029 --> 00:01:14,114
All right, you guys wait here
until we get back, okay?

19
00:01:15,533 --> 00:01:16,658
Stay.

20
00:01:22,749 --> 00:01:25,709
Why would there be fence posts
but no fence?

21
00:02:01,663 --> 00:02:06,375
Thank you all
forjoining me on this historic occasion.

22
00:02:08,711 --> 00:02:10,671
When l was a boy,

23
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:15,592
a Firebender struck down
my entire family and left me scarred.

24
00:02:16,177 --> 00:02:21,640
That tragic event
began my quest to equalize the world.

25
00:02:21,724 --> 00:02:23,100
That's a lie, Amon.

26
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,688
Or should l call you Noatak?

27
00:02:30,608 --> 00:02:32,985
-You want her taken out?
-No.

28
00:02:33,069 --> 00:02:34,862
Everyone, calm down.

29
00:02:35,071 --> 00:02:37,447
We have nothing to fear
from the Avatar.

30
00:02:37,532 --> 00:02:39,700
Let's hear what she has to say.

31
00:02:39,784 --> 00:02:42,035
Amon has been lying to you.

32
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:45,372
The Spirits didn't give him the power
to take people's bending away.

33
00:02:45,456 --> 00:02:47,749
He uses bloodbending to do it.

34
00:02:47,876 --> 00:02:49,960
Amon is a Waterbender.

35
00:02:52,797 --> 00:02:54,089
What is this nonsense?

36
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:56,008
You're desperate, Avatar.

37
00:02:56,092 --> 00:02:59,553
Making up stories about me
is a pathetic last resort.

38
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:02,139
Your family
wasn't killed by a Firebender.

39
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:06,935
His father was Yakone,
and his brother is Councilman Tarrlok.

40
00:03:09,147 --> 00:03:13,525
An amusing tale.
But l will show you the truth.

41
00:03:26,831 --> 00:03:30,167
This is what a Firebender did to me.

42
00:03:30,168 --> 00:03:31,376
What?

43
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:34,004
The Avatar is lying.

44
00:03:34,088 --> 00:03:36,215
l'm telling you, he's a Waterbender.

45
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:40,010
They don't believe me. lt didn't work.

46
00:03:40,094 --> 00:03:42,554
We said what we had to.
Let's get out of here.

47
00:03:45,183 --> 00:03:49,978
l wouldn't leave yet, Avatar.
You'll miss the main event.

48
00:04:00,198 --> 00:04:02,699
No. They got away.

49
00:04:03,618 --> 00:04:05,577
We saw them get away.

50
00:04:08,164 --> 00:04:10,207
Asami.

51
00:04:11,042 --> 00:04:14,920
Asami, l know l have hurt you,
and l am sorry.

52
00:04:15,004 --> 00:04:16,213
But l believe that one day,

53
00:04:16,214 --> 00:04:19,424
you will come to your senses
and we can be a family again.

54
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:21,218
Are you insane?

55
00:04:21,219 --> 00:04:24,054
How can we be a family
after everything you've done?

56
00:04:24,138 --> 00:04:26,223
Mom would hate you
for what you've become.

57
00:04:26,224 --> 00:04:30,018
How dare you! l am avenging her death!

58
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:34,564
-The airplanes are ready for takeoff, sir.
-Good. Annihilate the fleet.

59
00:04:36,234 --> 00:04:38,110
That's right, General.

60
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:41,613
l intercepted
your message to Commander Bumi.

61
00:04:41,698 --> 00:04:44,866
l know exactly where they're hiding.

62
00:04:47,495 --> 00:04:49,496
How are we going to get out of here?

63
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:51,540
l don't suppose
you know how to metalbend?

64
00:04:51,624 --> 00:04:53,583
That is a negative, sir.

65
00:05:00,258 --> 00:05:02,426
Naga, over here.

66
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:15,897
Who needs a Metalbender?
We got Naga. Yeah!

67
00:05:19,277 --> 00:05:23,405
-l'm going after those airplanes.
-No! No, Naga!

68
00:05:32,874 --> 00:05:36,585
What do you know?
Just like a Future lndustries forklift.

69
00:05:58,941 --> 00:06:02,235
Tonight, l rid the world of airbending.

70
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,403
Forever.

71
00:06:03,488 --> 00:06:05,322
Amon, let them go.

72
00:06:05,323 --> 00:06:08,367
You're welcome to
come down here and try to stop me.

73
00:06:08,451 --> 00:06:12,245
-He's trying to bait you.
-l don't care. We have to save them.

74
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:16,666
The Avatar needs to be reminded of
the power l possess.

75
00:06:35,436 --> 00:06:37,354
-Where are Pema and the baby?
-ln prison.

76
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,688
-Beifong?
-l don't know.

77
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:54,371
Follow me, kids.

78
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:02,587
Get them out of here.
We'll create a diversion.

79
00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:06,091
-Let's go get your mother and the baby.
-Prison break!

80
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:09,446
Let her go!

81
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:26,713
No!

82
00:08:26,797 --> 00:08:27,839
Korra!

83
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:42,479
l told you l would destroy you.

84
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:20,577
Thanks for looking out for me, Aang.

85
00:10:44,852 --> 00:10:46,770
Thanks, Naga.

86
00:10:53,611 --> 00:10:55,236
Asami.

87
00:10:56,238 --> 00:10:57,989
What do you think you're doing?

88
00:10:58,074 --> 00:11:01,117
You are aiding the very people
who took your mother away.

89
00:11:01,369 --> 00:11:05,580
You don't feel love for Mom anymore.
You're too full of hatred.

90
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:09,626
You ungratefuI, insoIent chiId!

91
00:11:29,647 --> 00:11:32,524
l now see
there is no chance to save you.

92
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:43,284
Mr. Sato, you are a horrible father.

93
00:12:05,474 --> 00:12:07,726
You really are a horrible father.

94
00:12:23,617 --> 00:12:26,786
Finally, you are powerless.

95
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:36,337
Amon.

96
00:12:37,381 --> 00:12:40,592
Everything the Avatar said is true,
isn't it?

97
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:43,011
l just saw you bloodbend her.

98
00:12:50,728 --> 00:12:53,938
You traitor. l dedicated my life to you.

99
00:13:03,741 --> 00:13:06,409
You served me well, Lieutenant.

100
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:47,700
Mako. My bending...

101
00:13:47,785 --> 00:13:50,745
Everything will be all right.
We just need to get out of here.

102
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:01,714
l'm impressed.

103
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:04,676
No one has ever
gotten the better of me like that.

104
00:14:07,429 --> 00:14:11,766
lt is almost a shame to take the bending
of someone so talented.

105
00:14:12,059 --> 00:14:13,935
Almost.

106
00:14:17,731 --> 00:14:18,731
No!

107
00:14:26,156 --> 00:14:27,740
lmpossible!

108
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:31,160
l... l can airbend?

109
00:14:31,787 --> 00:14:33,413
l can airbend!

110
00:14:49,305 --> 00:14:52,348
No, you don't!

111
00:14:59,106 --> 00:15:01,149
Did you see what happened?
Who was that?

112
00:15:09,617 --> 00:15:10,617
Could that be...

113
00:15:11,076 --> 00:15:14,412
-You bending tyrant.
-Evil Avatar.

114
00:15:14,496 --> 00:15:15,997
What did you do to our leader?

115
00:15:30,888 --> 00:15:32,305
-He's waterbending!
-What?

116
00:15:32,389 --> 00:15:34,015
-He is a bender.
-The scar is fake.

117
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:36,059
The Avatar was telling the truth.

118
00:16:08,258 --> 00:16:09,592
Noatak.

119
00:16:10,719 --> 00:16:12,679
lt's over, brother.

120
00:16:12,763 --> 00:16:15,723
l'm sorry for what l had to do to you.

121
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:20,770
Our father set us on this path.
Fate caused us to collide.

122
00:16:20,854 --> 00:16:23,481
l should have left with you
when we were boys.

123
00:16:24,942 --> 00:16:26,859
Leave with me now.

124
00:16:27,403 --> 00:16:30,947
We have a second chance.
We can start over together.

125
00:16:31,115 --> 00:16:34,242
Please.
You're all l have left in the world.

126
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:45,294
l can't believe Amon got you, too.

127
00:16:45,379 --> 00:16:47,964
Hey, at least
you unlocked your airbending.

128
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:51,342
Bro, not the time.

129
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:56,806
Right. Right. l'll just stand over here.
Quietly. ln silence.

130
00:17:03,731 --> 00:17:07,442
-You saved Republic City.
-But Amon got away.

131
00:17:09,987 --> 00:17:11,988
Uncle Bumi's here!

132
00:17:17,077 --> 00:17:20,997
Great.
Now l have to entertain my brother.

133
00:17:31,341 --> 00:17:36,012
The two of us together again,
there's nothing we can't do.

134
00:17:36,013 --> 00:17:37,430
Yes, Noatak.

135
00:17:38,015 --> 00:17:39,932
"Noatak."

136
00:17:40,017 --> 00:17:43,519
l had almost forgotten
the sound of my own name.

137
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:03,247
lt will be just like the good old days.

138
00:18:37,074 --> 00:18:42,787
l've tried everything in my power,
but l cannot restore Korra's bending.

139
00:18:45,165 --> 00:18:48,376
But you're the best healer in the world.
You have to keep trying.

140
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:53,089
l'm sorry, there's nothing else l can do.
Korra can still airbend,

141
00:18:53,173 --> 00:18:56,092
but her connection to the other elements
has been severed.

142
00:19:05,102 --> 00:19:07,478
lt's going to be all right, Korra.

143
00:19:07,729 --> 00:19:09,981
No, it's not.

144
00:19:24,705 --> 00:19:26,414
Korra, wait.

145
00:19:28,792 --> 00:19:30,376
Go away.

146
00:19:30,586 --> 00:19:34,130
l will, but l just want you to know
l'm here for you.

147
00:19:34,882 --> 00:19:38,551
No, l mean go away,
back to Republic City.

148
00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:40,553
Get on with your life.

149
00:19:40,721 --> 00:19:42,096
What are you talking about?

150
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:46,142
l'm not the Avatar anymore.
You don't need to do me any favors.

151
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:50,146
l don't care if you're the Avatar or not.

152
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:53,482
Listen, when Tarrlok took you,

153
00:19:53,567 --> 00:19:57,153
l was losing my mind at the thought of
never seeing you again.

154
00:19:57,154 --> 00:20:00,781
l realized l love you, Korra.

155
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:03,326
l...

156
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:05,536
-l can't.
-Korra!

157
00:20:15,172 --> 00:20:17,256
We need to be patient with her.

158
00:20:17,341 --> 00:20:20,301
lt will take time for her to accept
what has happened.

159
00:21:02,219 --> 00:21:05,554
Not now, Tenzin.
l just want to be left alone.

160
00:21:05,639 --> 00:21:07,515
But you called me here.

161
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:11,018
Aang.

162
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:14,230
You have finally connected
with your spiritual self.

163
00:21:14,314 --> 00:21:15,564
How?

164
00:21:15,649 --> 00:21:19,819
When we hit our lowest point,
we are open to the greatest change.

165
00:22:19,296 --> 00:22:21,380
l love you, too.

166
00:23:05,342 --> 00:23:06,467
Thank you.

167
00:23:08,845 --> 00:23:12,556
l am so proud of you, Avatar Korra.
