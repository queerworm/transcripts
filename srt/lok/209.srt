1
00:00:07,815 --> 00:00:09,483
Earth.

2
00:00:09,485 --> 00:00:11,351
Fire.

3
00:00:11,353 --> 00:00:13,070
Air.

4
00:00:13,072 --> 00:00:15,222
Water.

5
00:00:15,224 --> 00:00:19,243
Only the Avatar can master
all four elements

6
00:00:19,245 --> 00:00:21,328
and bring balance to the world.

7
00:00:27,252 --> 00:00:29,086
Male narrator:
Korra has regained her memory!

8
00:00:29,088 --> 00:00:31,404
By connecting
with the original Avatar,

9
00:00:31,406 --> 00:00:33,040
Korra learned
that to stop Unalaq

10
00:00:33,042 --> 00:00:36,076
she must close the spirit portal
before harmonic convergence,

11
00:00:36,078 --> 00:00:37,744
which is only weeks away!

12
00:00:37,746 --> 00:00:40,514
Meanwhile, Varrick
has made Bolin into a mover star

13
00:00:40,516 --> 00:00:42,216
and saved Asami's company.

14
00:00:42,218 --> 00:00:43,383
Mako is the only one

15
00:00:43,385 --> 00:00:45,135
who suspects
that Varrick is up to no good,

16
00:00:45,137 --> 00:00:46,803
but can he prove it?

17
00:00:56,564 --> 00:00:58,649
Gotcha!

18
00:00:58,651 --> 00:01:00,033
Furry-foot, come back.

19
00:01:00,035 --> 00:01:01,434
[Laughs]

20
00:01:01,436 --> 00:01:04,705
[Purring]

21
00:01:04,707 --> 00:01:06,540
[Laughs]

22
00:01:06,542 --> 00:01:08,325
Jinora, there you are.

23
00:01:08,327 --> 00:01:10,744
Come on, everyone's waiting.

24
00:01:10,746 --> 00:01:12,612
Were you playing with someone?

25
00:01:12,614 --> 00:01:15,632
Oh, just some
imaginary friends.

26
00:01:17,385 --> 00:01:20,304
[Laughs]

27
00:01:22,056 --> 00:01:23,590
Stop telling lies.

28
00:01:23,592 --> 00:01:24,958
It's true!

29
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,678
I once beat an earthbender
in a rock-throwing contest!

30
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,680
I have the trophy to prove it.

31
00:01:29,682 --> 00:01:31,815
All right, who's ready
for an exciting tour

32
00:01:31,817 --> 00:01:33,350
of the eastern air temple?

33
00:01:33,352 --> 00:01:34,901
We've got a lot to see today

34
00:01:34,903 --> 00:01:38,155
including ancient statues,
ancient gardens,

35
00:01:38,157 --> 00:01:41,825
and the meditation hall
used by ancient airbenders.

36
00:01:41,827 --> 00:01:42,859
Yay.

37
00:01:42,861 --> 00:01:44,111
Old things.

38
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:49,950
Korra?

39
00:01:49,952 --> 00:01:50,984
All: Korra!

40
00:01:50,986 --> 00:01:52,336
Yay, Korra.

41
00:01:52,338 --> 00:01:53,337
Korra's back.

42
00:01:53,339 --> 00:01:54,538
What are you doing here?

43
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:56,290
And how did you know
where to find us?

44
00:01:56,292 --> 00:01:57,791
Tenzin's itinerary.

45
00:01:57,793 --> 00:01:59,209
We went over it
like a hundred times

46
00:01:59,211 --> 00:02:00,761
before we left Republic City.

47
00:02:00,763 --> 00:02:01,762
See?

48
00:02:01,764 --> 00:02:03,997
This is why
schedules are important.

49
00:02:03,999 --> 00:02:06,666
It's so great
to see you all again.

50
00:02:06,668 --> 00:02:08,852
It's great to see you too,

51
00:02:08,854 --> 00:02:10,687
but why aren't you training
at the South pole?

52
00:02:10,689 --> 00:02:13,190
Wait, you don't know
about the civil war?

53
00:02:13,192 --> 00:02:14,191
What?

54
00:02:14,193 --> 00:02:15,442
No.

55
00:02:15,444 --> 00:02:17,227
We've been out of touch
with the outside world

56
00:02:17,229 --> 00:02:18,445
since we started our vacation.

57
00:02:18,447 --> 00:02:19,730
Tenzin's idea.

58
00:02:19,732 --> 00:02:21,064
What happened?

59
00:02:21,066 --> 00:02:22,232
So much.

60
00:02:22,234 --> 00:02:23,850
I don't know where to start.

61
00:02:23,852 --> 00:02:25,068
Just tell us everything!

62
00:02:25,070 --> 00:02:26,737
Everything?

63
00:02:26,739 --> 00:02:28,521
Okay.

64
00:02:28,523 --> 00:02:30,407
I opened a spirit portal
at the South pole,

65
00:02:30,409 --> 00:02:32,292
but then Unalaq
turned out to be a bad guy

66
00:02:32,294 --> 00:02:33,860
and wanted to take control
of the South,

67
00:02:33,862 --> 00:02:35,379
so I sort of started
a civil war,

68
00:02:35,381 --> 00:02:36,830
but when I went to
find some help,

69
00:02:36,832 --> 00:02:38,248
I was attacked by my cousins

70
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:39,716
and then by
a giant, dark spirit,

71
00:02:39,718 --> 00:02:41,168
and then I forgot who I was,

72
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:42,469
and then I met the first Avatar,

73
00:02:42,471 --> 00:02:43,837
and then I realized

74
00:02:43,839 --> 00:02:45,639
I shouldn't have opened
the portal in the first place,

75
00:02:45,641 --> 00:02:46,921
and now I need to
close it again!

76
00:02:48,393 --> 00:02:49,976
I knew this would happen.

77
00:02:51,979 --> 00:02:56,817
So Avatar Wan imprisoned
this dark spirit Vaatu

78
00:02:56,819 --> 00:02:58,385
in the spirit world?

79
00:02:58,387 --> 00:03:01,355
Yes, and now I think my Uncle
is trying to free him.

80
00:03:01,357 --> 00:03:03,407
I knew Unalaq
was hungry for power

81
00:03:03,409 --> 00:03:06,026
but never realized
how far he would go to get it.

82
00:03:06,028 --> 00:03:07,444
This is all my fault.

83
00:03:07,446 --> 00:03:09,229
No, don't blame yourself.

84
00:03:09,231 --> 00:03:10,914
This is Unalaq's doing.

85
00:03:10,916 --> 00:03:12,866
Now, we must focus
on setting things right

86
00:03:12,868 --> 00:03:14,868
before he can do
any more damage.

87
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:16,036
Thank you.

88
00:03:16,038 --> 00:03:20,090
So you need to close
the Southern portal,

89
00:03:20,092 --> 00:03:22,376
but if Unalaq's army
controls the South,

90
00:03:22,378 --> 00:03:23,510
how are we going to get to it?

91
00:03:23,512 --> 00:03:25,178
I thought about that.

92
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:28,181
My best chance to close
the portal is from the inside.

93
00:03:28,183 --> 00:03:30,717
I have to enter
the spirit world.

94
00:03:30,719 --> 00:03:32,936
A journey to the spirit world.

95
00:03:32,938 --> 00:03:35,255
All my years
of spiritual training

96
00:03:35,257 --> 00:03:37,858
have prepared me
for this moment.

97
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:39,109
I will help you.

98
00:03:39,111 --> 00:03:42,646
Today, we enter
the spirit world.

99
00:03:45,733 --> 00:03:47,600
Father, what are we doing here?

100
00:03:47,602 --> 00:03:50,036
You're here to straighten out
the mess you caused

101
00:03:50,038 --> 00:03:52,272
when you failed
to capture the Avatar.

102
00:03:52,274 --> 00:03:54,607
I told you,
it wasn't our fault.

103
00:03:54,609 --> 00:03:55,709
You're right.

104
00:03:55,711 --> 00:03:57,944
It was my fault
for trusting you.

105
00:03:57,946 --> 00:04:00,380
Harmonic convergence
is almost upon us.

106
00:04:00,382 --> 00:04:03,300
This is my opportunity
to change the world.

107
00:04:03,302 --> 00:04:05,952
We'll make it up to you,
father.

108
00:04:05,954 --> 00:04:08,171
Good,
because I'll need your help

109
00:04:08,173 --> 00:04:10,623
to open the northern portal.

110
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:12,792
I thought only
the Avatar could do it.

111
00:04:12,794 --> 00:04:15,228
I believe there is another way.

112
00:04:22,803 --> 00:04:24,738
This way.

113
00:04:28,192 --> 00:04:29,826
There it is:

114
00:04:29,828 --> 00:04:31,828
The northern portal.

115
00:04:36,918 --> 00:04:39,836
[Screams]

116
00:04:43,257 --> 00:04:45,091
Cut!

117
00:04:45,093 --> 00:04:47,043
Okay, that's lunch, everyone.

118
00:04:47,045 --> 00:04:49,596
[Bell rings]

119
00:04:49,598 --> 00:04:52,382
Hello?
Anyone?

120
00:04:52,384 --> 00:04:55,385
Nuktuk's still up here,
all alone.

121
00:04:55,387 --> 00:04:56,937
[Door slams]

122
00:04:56,939 --> 00:04:58,104
[Footsteps]

123
00:04:58,106 --> 00:04:59,105
Asami!

124
00:04:59,107 --> 00:05:00,507
Hey, what are you doing here?

125
00:05:00,509 --> 00:05:03,009
Varrick invited me
to watch some of the filming.

126
00:05:03,011 --> 00:05:05,612
Are you filming right now?

127
00:05:05,614 --> 00:05:06,613
Right now?
Nope.

128
00:05:06,615 --> 00:05:07,614
We're, uh...

129
00:05:07,616 --> 00:05:08,815
We're at lunch.

130
00:05:08,817 --> 00:05:10,700
Asami, there you are.

131
00:05:10,702 --> 00:05:11,701
Is Bolin around?

132
00:05:11,703 --> 00:05:12,702
Up here.

133
00:05:12,704 --> 00:05:13,853
Good.

134
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:15,071
I've got something
to tell you both.

135
00:05:15,073 --> 00:05:16,072
[Screams]

136
00:05:16,074 --> 00:05:17,073
[Grunts]

137
00:05:17,075 --> 00:05:18,124
Ow.

138
00:05:18,126 --> 00:05:20,210
I got to stop doing
my own stunts.

139
00:05:20,212 --> 00:05:23,547
I found out who's been
stealing from future industries:

140
00:05:23,549 --> 00:05:25,165
Varrick.

141
00:05:25,167 --> 00:05:26,166
What?

142
00:05:26,168 --> 00:05:27,167
No.

143
00:05:27,169 --> 00:05:28,635
He attacked his own ship?

144
00:05:28,637 --> 00:05:29,636
Yes!

145
00:05:29,638 --> 00:05:31,087
It was a ploy.

146
00:05:31,089 --> 00:05:32,923
He wants Republic City
to go to war,

147
00:05:32,925 --> 00:05:34,474
and he wants control
of the businesses

148
00:05:34,476 --> 00:05:36,376
that stand to profit
the most from it.

149
00:05:36,378 --> 00:05:37,811
He already had all the shipping.

150
00:05:37,813 --> 00:05:39,980
All he needed
was future industries.

151
00:05:39,982 --> 00:05:42,816
Varrick helped save
Future Industries.

152
00:05:42,818 --> 00:05:45,902
He's my business partner now,
not an evil mastermind.

153
00:05:45,904 --> 00:05:48,355
Mako, you seem stressed.

154
00:05:48,357 --> 00:05:49,889
I am stressed!

155
00:05:49,891 --> 00:05:51,775
See, this is why
I had to move out.

156
00:05:51,777 --> 00:05:53,660
You guys aren't
living together anymore?

157
00:05:53,662 --> 00:05:54,661
Nope.

158
00:05:54,663 --> 00:05:56,029
It was time for this eagle-hawk

159
00:05:56,031 --> 00:05:59,366
to spread his wings and fly.

160
00:05:59,368 --> 00:06:01,868
Sounds like you've had
a pretty busy week.

161
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:03,787
Maybe you just need to relax.

162
00:06:06,507 --> 00:06:08,575
Wait a minute.

163
00:06:08,577 --> 00:06:10,794
Are you two...

164
00:06:10,796 --> 00:06:11,878
you're dating again!

165
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:12,879
What?

166
00:06:12,881 --> 00:06:13,880
Dating?
No!

167
00:06:13,882 --> 00:06:14,881
That's crazy!

168
00:06:14,883 --> 00:06:17,017
Korra just left a week ago!

169
00:06:17,019 --> 00:06:19,436
Guys, listen to me.

170
00:06:19,438 --> 00:06:22,088
Varrick is up to no good,
and I have proof.

171
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:24,024
The detonators
he uses in his movers

172
00:06:24,026 --> 00:06:25,525
are exactly like
the one I found

173
00:06:25,527 --> 00:06:26,926
at the cultural center attack.

174
00:06:26,928 --> 00:06:29,262
And those explosions
were exactly like the ones

175
00:06:29,264 --> 00:06:32,198
the Captain reported when
Asami's shipment was hijacked.

176
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,283
Don't you see?

177
00:06:33,285 --> 00:06:34,818
Anyone could have
gotten their hands

178
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:36,036
on one of those detonators.

179
00:06:36,038 --> 00:06:37,037
Yeah.

180
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:38,038
Let it go, Mako.

181
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,573
Let it go.

182
00:06:39,575 --> 00:06:40,574
No!

183
00:06:40,576 --> 00:06:42,075
I'm not going to let it go!

184
00:06:47,448 --> 00:06:49,215
Varrick's been looking for you.

185
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:54,137
You're lucky.

186
00:06:54,139 --> 00:06:56,056
This temple

00:14:49,817 --> 00:14:52,234
I couldn't figure out
what it was until now.

371
00:14:52,236 --> 00:14:54,120
It was the first Avatar.

372
00:14:54,122 --> 00:14:55,488
When did this happen?

373
00:14:55,490 --> 00:14:56,906
It was on the solstice.

374
00:14:56,908 --> 00:14:59,742
That's the day
I opened the Southern portal.

375
00:14:59,744 --> 00:15:00,743
Both: Whoa.

376
00:15:00,745 --> 00:15:01,911
[Oogi groans]

377
00:15:01,913 --> 00:15:02,912
We're here!

378
00:15:06,633 --> 00:15:07,833
Are you sure these spirits

379
00:15:07,835 --> 00:15:09,552
are leading us
to the right place?

380
00:15:09,554 --> 00:15:10,619
Of course!

381
00:15:10,621 --> 00:15:12,755
I trust Bum-Ju with my life.

382
00:15:19,813 --> 00:15:22,264
Look.

383
00:15:22,266 --> 00:15:24,400
There are carvings on them.

384
00:15:24,402 --> 00:15:28,904
This is an ancient airbender
meditation circle.

385
00:15:31,491 --> 00:15:34,860
There's a lot of
spiritual energy in this place,

386
00:15:34,862 --> 00:15:37,496
but it feels really strange.

387
00:15:37,498 --> 00:15:40,282
We'll have to perform
a spiritual cleansing ceremony.

388
00:15:40,284 --> 00:15:41,617
What are you talking about?

389
00:15:41,619 --> 00:15:42,835
Dad taught it to me.

390
00:15:42,837 --> 00:15:45,337
This site has been neglected
for many years.

391
00:15:45,339 --> 00:15:48,007
A cleansing ceremony will help
strengthen its connection

392
00:15:48,009 --> 00:15:49,341
to the spirit world.

393
00:16:03,723 --> 00:16:05,975
Good job, you cleansed the area

394
00:16:05,977 --> 00:16:07,977
of the only spirits
that want to help us,

395
00:16:07,979 --> 00:16:09,778
and you scared away Bum-Ju.

396
00:16:16,453 --> 00:16:17,686
It's working.

397
00:16:17,688 --> 00:16:20,623
[Low rumbling]

398
00:16:25,495 --> 00:16:26,495
Boom!

399
00:16:26,497 --> 00:16:27,496
[Screaming]

400
00:16:27,498 --> 00:16:30,416
[Bats shrieking]

401
00:16:37,094 --> 00:16:40,029
[Bats shrieking]

402
00:16:42,483 --> 00:16:44,200
Ah!
Bats!

403
00:16:44,202 --> 00:16:45,768
Evil bats!

404
00:16:45,770 --> 00:16:47,203
Not bats.

405
00:16:47,205 --> 00:16:48,121
Dark spirits!

406
00:16:59,583 --> 00:17:00,800
What are we supposed to do?

407
00:17:32,316 --> 00:17:34,000
Amazing.

408
00:17:51,385 --> 00:17:54,137
Your spiritual training
has come a long way.

409
00:17:54,139 --> 00:17:55,805
Unalaq may be
a horrible person,

410
00:17:55,807 --> 00:17:57,857
but his spirit powers
are no joke.

411
00:17:57,859 --> 00:18:01,227
He taught you how to
transform dark spirits.

412
00:18:01,229 --> 00:18:03,479
I can't even get you
into the spirit world.

413
00:18:03,481 --> 00:18:06,733
Everything Unalaq taught me
was to help himself.

414
00:18:06,735 --> 00:18:08,985
Everything you've done
was meant to help me.

415
00:18:08,987 --> 00:18:13,873
I am so sorry for turning
my back on you as my mentor.

416
00:18:13,875 --> 00:18:15,742
I need you now more than ever.

417
00:18:16,827 --> 00:18:18,378
I won't let you down.

418
00:18:27,704 --> 00:18:30,173
The ancient airbenders
must have built this site.

419
00:18:31,759 --> 00:18:33,393
If we meditate here,

420
00:18:33,395 --> 00:18:35,978
we'll be able
to enter the spirit world.

421
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:38,547
Why don't you go first?

422
00:18:38,549 --> 00:18:40,383
After all these years,

423
00:18:40,385 --> 00:18:43,736
my father's dream for me
will finally come true.

424
00:18:47,524 --> 00:18:49,108
[Knocks on door]

425
00:18:51,745 --> 00:18:52,895
Hi.

426
00:18:52,897 --> 00:18:54,113
Did you come by to tell me

427
00:18:54,115 --> 00:18:55,498
how paranoid I am?

428
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:56,783
No.

429
00:18:56,785 --> 00:18:58,701
I just wanted to come by
to make sure you're okay.

430
00:18:58,703 --> 00:19:00,253
You seemed so agitated earlier.

431
00:19:00,255 --> 00:19:01,570
I'm fine.

432
00:19:01,572 --> 00:19:03,172
Maybe you need a night off.

433
00:19:03,174 --> 00:19:04,707
Why don't we go get some dinner?

434
00:19:04,709 --> 00:19:06,376
No, thanks.

435
00:19:06,378 --> 00:19:07,410
I'm a little busy.

436
00:19:07,412 --> 00:19:09,629
Too busy for Kwong's cuisine?

437
00:19:09,631 --> 00:19:10,797
Remember?

438
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:12,465
We had our first date there.

439
00:19:12,467 --> 00:19:14,417
Maybe I do need to
get my mind off things.

440
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:17,303
[Knocks on door]

441
00:19:17,305 --> 00:19:18,254
Police!

442
00:19:20,224 --> 00:19:21,524
Hey, Mako.

443
00:19:21,526 --> 00:19:23,426
Hope we didn't interrupt
you two lovebirds.

444
00:19:24,728 --> 00:19:25,812
What's going on?

445
00:19:25,814 --> 00:19:27,263
We busted some triple threats

446
00:19:27,265 --> 00:19:28,698
who said you hired them
for a job.

447
00:19:30,401 --> 00:19:31,401
All right.

448
00:19:31,403 --> 00:19:32,735
It's true.

449
00:19:32,737 --> 00:19:35,238
We were trying to figure out
who stole Asami's stuff,

450
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:38,040
so we hired them
for a sting operation.

451
00:19:38,042 --> 00:19:39,742
I'm sorry for
going behind your back.

452
00:19:41,495 --> 00:19:43,079
According to
the triple threats,

453
00:19:43,081 --> 00:19:44,247
you did more than that.

454
00:19:44,249 --> 00:19:45,498
They said you helped them steal

455
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:47,450
a warehouse full of
future industries property.

456
00:19:47,452 --> 00:19:48,784
That's crazy!

457
00:19:48,786 --> 00:19:50,636
You're gonna believe
a bunch of criminals?

458
00:19:50,638 --> 00:19:52,388
I have to follow up on a lead.

459
00:19:54,291 --> 00:19:56,959
Well, looky what I found:

460
00:19:56,961 --> 00:19:58,561
Cash...

461
00:19:58,563 --> 00:19:59,762
And these.

462
00:20:00,981 --> 00:20:03,065
What are you doing
with explosives, Mako?

463
00:20:03,067 --> 00:20:04,851
I don't know
where those came from.

464
00:20:04,853 --> 00:20:06,486
You're under arrest.

465
00:20:06,488 --> 00:20:08,438
None of that is mine.

466
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:11,140
Should've known you'd hook up
with your old pals.

467
00:20:11,142 --> 00:20:14,327
Once a triple threat,
always a triple threat.

468
00:20:14,329 --> 00:20:16,145
This has to be a mistake.

469
00:20:16,147 --> 00:20:17,997
Sorry to break the news
to you, sweetie,

470
00:20:17,999 --> 00:20:20,533
but your boyfriend's
just a crooked cop.

471
00:20:20,535 --> 00:20:23,035
That sting operation
was just a way

472
00:20:23,037 --> 00:20:24,820
to lure you away
from your warehouse.

473
00:20:24,822 --> 00:20:25,988
[Laughs]

474
00:20:25,990 --> 00:20:28,824
He was using you
the whole time.

475
00:20:28,826 --> 00:20:30,009
That's not true, Asami.

476
00:20:30,011 --> 00:20:32,328
I would never do anything
to hurt you.

477
00:20:32,330 --> 00:20:33,329
It's Varrick.

478
00:20:33,331 --> 00:20:34,514
This is all Varrick.

479
00:20:34,516 --> 00:20:36,132
He set me up!

480
00:20:36,134 --> 00:20:38,601
Yeah, it's Varrick's fault.

481
00:20:38,603 --> 00:20:39,936
Varrick.

You in the spirit world yet?

485
00:20:52,850 --> 00:20:54,700
No, I am not,

486
00:20:54,702 --> 00:20:56,685
and stop bugging me.

487

[Wood clattering]

488
00:20:57,956 --> 00:20:59,906
It's okay, Tenzin.

489
00:20:59,908 --> 00:21:01,657
Maybe you weren't meant to
guide Korra

490
00:21:01,659 --> 00:21:02,992
into the spirit world.

491
00:21:02,994 --> 00:21:04,460
No!
Just give me some time.

492
00:21:04,462 --> 00:21:06,829
Stop being so stubborn.

493
00:21:06,831 --> 00:21:08,531
It's not your destiny.

494
00:21:08,533 --> 00:21:11,133
I think Jinora was meant to
guide the Avatar.

495
00:21:11,135 --> 00:21:13,669
Jinora will not enter
the spirit world!

496
00:21:13,671 --> 00:21:16,138
She's not ready for the dangers
of the other side,

497
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:17,807
but I am.

498
00:21:17,809 --> 00:21:19,642
I've spent years training,
studying,

499
00:21:19,644 --> 00:21:21,427
and mastering
everything there is to know

500
00:21:21,429 --> 00:21:22,512
about the spirit world.

501
00:21:22,514 --> 00:21:24,380
Tenzin, we're running
out of time.

502
00:21:24,382 --> 00:21:26,048
If everyone could just be quiet

503
00:21:26,050 --> 00:21:27,383
and let me focus.

504
00:21:28,902 --> 00:21:30,219
Aunt Kya is right.

505
00:21:30,221 --> 00:21:33,055
I can guide Korra
into the spirit world.

506
00:21:33,057 --> 00:21:34,323
I'll be all right.

507
00:21:41,198 --> 00:21:43,416
Perhaps I will never have
the connection with spirits

508
00:21:43,418 --> 00:21:45,251
like I always wanted...

509
00:21:45,253 --> 00:21:48,538
Like my father
wanted me to have.

510
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:50,540
It's okay, daddy.

511
00:21:50,542 --> 00:21:52,758
I'm proud of you.

512
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:53,759
Go.

513
00:21:53,761 --> 00:21:55,044
Close the portal.

514
00:21:55,046 --> 00:21:56,712

and we cannot open

I have failed you, Vaatu.

521

You have not failed me...

522

Yet.

523
00:22:43,561 --> 00:22:47,296
The Avatar still lives.

524
00:22:47,298 --> 00:22:48,931
How do you know?

525
00:22:48,933 --> 00:22:53,790
Even though my connection
to Raava was severed,

526
00:22:53,835 --> 00:22:56,953
I can still feel her
presence.

527

- I'll find her.
- The Avatar will find you.

528

She has just entered the
spirit world.
