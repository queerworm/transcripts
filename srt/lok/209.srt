1
00:00:07,458 --> 00:00:09,250
- EARTH.

2
00:00:09,291 --> 00:00:11,083
FIRE.

3
00:00:11,125 --> 00:00:12,750
AIR.

4
00:00:12,792 --> 00:00:15,166
WATER.

5
00:00:15,208 --> 00:00:18,959
ONLY THE AVATAR CAN MASTER
ALL FOUR ELEMENTS

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,083
AND BRING BALANCE TO THE WORLD.

7
00:00:27,583 --> 00:00:29,041
male narrator:
KORRA HAS REGAINED HER MEMORY!

8
00:00:29,083 --> 00:00:31,417
BY CONNECTING
WITH THE ORIGINAL AVATAR,

9
00:00:31,458 --> 00:00:32,959
KORRA LEARNED
THAT TO STOP UNALAQ

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
SHE MUST CLOSE THE SPIRIT PORTAL
BEFORE HARMONIC CONVERGENCE,

11
00:00:36,041 --> 00:00:37,583
WHICH IS ONLY WEEKS AWAY!

12
00:00:37,625 --> 00:00:40,291
MEANWHILE, VARRICK
HAS MADE BOLIN INTO A MOVER STAR

13
00:00:40,333 --> 00:00:41,917
AND SAVED ASAMI'S COMPANY.

14
00:00:41,959 --> 00:00:43,458
MAKO IS THE ONLY ONE

15
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:44,834
WHO SUSPECTS
THAT VARRICK IS UP TO NO GOOD,

16
00:00:44,875 --> 00:00:46,458
BUT CAN HE PROVE IT?

17
00:00:56,375 --> 00:00:58,458
- GOTCHA!

18
00:00:58,500 --> 00:00:59,750
FURRY-FOOT, COME BACK.

19
00:00:59,792 --> 00:01:01,250
[laughs]

20
00:01:01,291 --> 00:01:04,583
- [purring]

21
00:01:04,625 --> 00:01:06,375
- [laughs]

22
00:01:06,417 --> 00:01:08,125
- JINORA, THERE YOU ARE.

23
00:01:08,166 --> 00:01:10,667
COME ON, EVERYONE'S WAITING.

24
00:01:10,709 --> 00:01:12,500
WERE YOU PLAYING WITH SOMEONE?

25
00:01:12,542 --> 00:01:15,333
- OH, JUST SOME
IMAGINARY FRIENDS.

26
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:20,166
[laughs]

27
00:01:22,083 --> 00:01:23,458
- STOP TELLING LIES.

28
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:25,083
- IT'S TRUE!

29
00:01:25,125 --> 00:01:27,583
I ONCE BEAT AN EARTHBENDER
IN A ROCK-THROWING CONTEST!

30
00:01:27,625 --> 00:01:29,583
I HAVE THE TROPHY TO PROVE IT.

31
00:01:29,625 --> 00:01:31,750
- ALL RIGHT, WHO'S READY
FOR AN EXCITING TOUR

32
00:01:31,792 --> 00:01:33,166
OF THE EASTERN AIR TEMPLE?

33
00:01:33,208 --> 00:01:34,792
WE'VE GOT A LOT TO SEE TODAY

34
00:01:34,834 --> 00:01:38,125
INCLUDING ANCIENT STATUES,
ANCIENT GARDENS,

35
00:01:38,166 --> 00:01:41,709
AND THE MEDITATION HALL
USED BY ANCIENT AIRBENDERS.

36
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:42,750
- YAY.

37
00:01:42,792 --> 00:01:43,834
OLD THINGS.

38
00:01:48,625 --> 00:01:49,834
- KORRA?

39
00:01:49,875 --> 00:01:50,625
all: KORRA!

40
00:01:50,667 --> 00:01:52,125
YAY, KORRA.

41
00:01:52,166 --> 00:01:53,125
- KORRA'S BACK.

42
00:01:53,166 --> 00:01:54,458
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

43
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:56,041
- AND HOW DID YOU KNOW
WHERE TO FIND US?

44
00:01:56,083 --> 00:01:57,667
- TENZIN'S ITINERARY.

45
00:01:57,709 --> 00:01:59,208
WE WENT OVER IT
LIKE A HUNDRED TIMES

46
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:00,709
BEFORE WE LEFT REPUBLIC CITY.

47
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:01,875
- SEE?

48
00:02:01,917 --> 00:02:04,000
THIS IS WHY
SCHEDULES ARE IMPORTANT.

49
00:02:04,041 --> 00:02:06,583
- IT'S SO GREAT
TO SEE YOU ALL AGAIN.

50
00:02:06,625 --> 00:02:08,834
- IT'S GREAT TO SEE YOU TOO,

51
00:02:08,875 --> 00:02:10,625
BUT WHY AREN'T YOU TRAINING
AT THE SOUTH POLE?

52
00:02:10,667 --> 00:02:13,000
- WAIT, YOU DON'T KNOW
ABOUT THE CIVIL WAR?

53
00:02:13,041 --> 00:02:14,000
- WHAT?

54
00:02:14,041 --> 00:02:15,667
NO.

55
00:02:15,709 --> 00:02:17,041
WE'VE BEEN OUT OF TOUCH
WITH THE OUTSIDE WORLD

56
00:02:17,083 --> 00:02:18,291
SINCE WE STARTED OUR VACATION.

57
00:02:18,333 --> 00:02:19,667
- TENZIN'S IDEA.

58
00:02:19,709 --> 00:02:20,834
WHAT HAPPENED?

59
00:02:20,875 --> 00:02:22,291
- SO MUCH.

60
00:02:22,333 --> 00:02:23,792
I DON'T KNOW WHERE TO START.

61
00:02:23,834 --> 00:02:24,834
- JUST TELL US EVERYTHING!

62
00:02:24,875 --> 00:02:26,667
- EVERYTHING?

63
00:02:26,709 --> 00:02:28,375
OKAY.

64
00:02:28,417 --> 00:02:30,500
I OPENED A SPIRIT PORTAL
AT THE SOUTH POLE,

65
00:02:30,542 --> 00:02:32,333
BUT THEN UNALAQ
TURNED OUT TO BE A BAD GUY

66
00:02:32,375 --> 00:02:33,834
AND WANTED TO TAKE CONTROL
OF THE SOUTH,

67
00:02:33,875 --> 00:02:35,250
SO I SORT OF STARTED
A CIVIL WAR,

68
00:02:35,291 --> 00:02:36,792
BUT WHEN I WENT TO
FIND SOME HELP,

69
00:02:36,834 --> 00:02:38,333
I WAS ATTACKED BY MY COUSINS

70
00:02:38,375 --> 00:02:39,667
AND THEN BY
A GIANT, DARK SPIRIT,

71
00:02:39,709 --> 00:02:41,208
AND THEN I FORGOT WHO I WAS,

72
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:42,333
AND THEN I MET THE FIRST AVATAR,

73
00:02:42,375 --> 00:02:43,792
AND THEN I REALIZED

74
00:02:43,834 --> 00:02:45,291
I SHOULDN'T HAVE OPENED
THE PORTAL IN THE FIRST PLACE,

75
00:02:45,333 --> 00:02:46,542
AND NOW I NEED TO
CLOSE IT AGAIN!

76
00:02:48,291 --> 00:02:49,750
- I KNEW THIS WOULD HAPPEN.

77
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,750
SO AVATAR WAN IMPRISONED
THIS DARK SPIRIT VAATU

78
00:02:56,792 --> 00:02:58,458
IN THE SPIRIT WORLD?

79
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:01,500
- YES, AND NOW I THINK MY UNCLE
IS TRYING TO FREE HIM.

80
00:03:01,542 --> 00:03:03,583
- I KNEW UNALAQ
WAS HUNGRY FOR POWER

81
00:03:03,625 --> 00:03:06,083
BUT NEVER REALIZED
HOW FAR HE WOULD GO TO GET IT.

82
00:03:06,125 --> 00:03:07,375
- THIS IS ALL MY FAULT.

83
00:03:07,417 --> 00:03:09,083
- NO, DON'T BLAME YOURSELF.

84
00:03:09,125 --> 00:03:10,959
THIS IS UNALAQ'S DOING.

85
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,875
NOW, WE MUST FOCUS
ON SETTING THINGS RIGHT

86
00:03:12,917 --> 00:03:14,875
BEFORE HE CAN DO
ANY MORE DAMAGE.

87
00:03:14,917 --> 00:03:16,291
- THANK YOU.

88
00:03:16,333 --> 00:03:20,208
- SO YOU NEED TO CLOSE
THE SOUTHERN PORTAL,

89
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:22,250
BUT IF UNALAQ'S ARMY
CONTROLS THE SOUTH,

90
00:03:22,291 --> 00:03:23,458
HOW ARE WE GOING TO GET TO IT?

91
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:25,291
- I THOUGHT ABOUT THAT.

92
00:03:25,333 --> 00:03:28,291
MY BEST CHANCE TO CLOSE
THE PORTAL IS FROM THE INSIDE.

93
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:30,709
I HAVE TO ENTER
THE SPIRIT WORLD.

94
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:33,000
- A JOURNEY TO THE SPIRIT WORLD.

95
00:03:33,041 --> 00:03:35,375
ALL MY YEARS
OF SPIRITUAL TRAINING

96
00:03:35,417 --> 00:03:37,875
HAVE PREPARED ME
FOR THIS MOMENT.

97
00:03:37,917 --> 00:03:39,208
I WILL HELP YOU.

98
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:42,417
TODAY, WE ENTER
THE SPIRIT WORLD.

99
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:47,792
- FATHER,
WHAT ARE WE DOING HERE?

100
00:03:47,834 --> 00:03:50,083
- YOU'RE HERE TO STRAIGHTEN OUT
THE MESS YOU CAUSED

101
00:03:50,125 --> 00:03:52,375
WHEN YOU FAILED
TO CAPTURE THE AVATAR.

102
00:03:52,417 --> 00:03:54,542
- I TOLD YOU,
IT WASN'T OUR FAULT.

103
00:03:54,583 --> 00:03:55,667
- YOU'RE RIGHT.

104
00:03:55,709 --> 00:03:58,000
IT WAS MY FAULT
FOR TRUSTING YOU.

105
00:03:58,041 --> 00:04:00,625
HARMONIC CONVERGENCE
IS ALMOST UPON US.

106
00:04:00,667 --> 00:04:03,542
THIS IS MY OPPORTUNITY
TO CHANGE THE WORLD.

107
00:04:03,583 --> 00:04:06,083
- WE'LL MAKE IT UP TO YOU,
FATHER.

108
00:04:06,125 --> 00:04:08,125
- GOOD,
BECAUSE I'LL NEED YOUR HELP

109
00:04:08,166 --> 00:04:10,667
TO OPEN THE NORTHERN PORTAL.

110
00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:12,875
- I THOUGHT ONLY
THE AVATAR COULD DO IT.

111
00:04:12,917 --> 00:04:15,208
- I BELIEVE
THERE IS ANOTHER WAY.

112
00:04:22,917 --> 00:04:24,583
THIS WAY.

113
00:04:28,125 --> 00:04:29,875
THERE IT IS:

114
00:04:29,917 --> 00:04:31,667
THE NORTHERN PORTAL.

115
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,667
- [screams]

116
00:04:43,208 --> 00:04:45,208
- CUT!

117
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:46,917
OKAY, THAT'S LUNCH, EVERYONE.

118
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:49,583
[bell rings]

119
00:04:49,625 --> 00:04:52,583
- HELLO?
ANYONE?

120
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:55,333
NUKTUK'S STILL UP HERE,
ALL ALONE.

121
00:04:55,375 --> 00:04:57,000
[door slams]

122
00:04:57,041 --> 00:04:57,959
[footsteps]

123
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,208
ASAMI!

124
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:00,834
HEY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

125
00:05:00,875 --> 00:05:03,166
- VARRICK INVITED ME
TO WATCH SOME OF THE FILMING.

126
00:05:03,208 --> 00:05:05,667
ARE YOU FILMING RIGHT NOW?

127
00:05:05,709 --> 00:05:06,667
- RIGHT NOW?
NOPE.

128
00:05:06,709 --> 00:05:07,667
WE'RE, UH...

129
00:05:07,709 --> 00:05:08,917
WE'RE AT LUNCH.

130
00:05:08,959 --> 00:05:10,792
- ASAMI, THERE YOU ARE.

131
00:05:10,834 --> 00:05:11,792
IS BOLIN AROUND?

132
00:05:11,834 --> 00:05:12,792
- UP HERE.

133
00:05:12,834 --> 00:05:13,959
- GOOD.

134
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I'VE GOT SOMETHING
TO TELL YOU BOTH.

135
00:05:15,041 --> 00:05:16,000
[screams]

136
00:05:16,041 --> 00:05:17,000
[grunts]

137
00:05:17,041 --> 00:05:18,458
OW.

138
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,458
I GOT TO STOP DOING
MY OWN STUNTS.

139
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:23,625
- I FOUND OUT WHO'S BEEN
STEALING FROM FUTURE INDUSTRIES:

140
00:05:23,667 --> 00:05:25,125
VARRICK.

141
00:05:25,166 --> 00:05:26,125
- WHAT?

142
00:05:26,166 --> 00:05:27,375
NO.

143
00:05:27,417 --> 00:05:28,709
- HE ATTACKED HIS OWN SHIP?

144
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:29,709
- YES!

145
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:31,291
IT WAS A PLOY.

146
00:05:31,333 --> 00:05:33,083
HE WANTS REPUBLIC CITY
TO GO TO WAR,

147
00:05:33,125 --> 00:05:34,750
AND HE WANTS CONTROL
OF THE BUSINESSES

148
00:05:34,792 --> 00:05:36,375
THAT STAND TO PROFIT
THE MOST FROM IT.

149
00:05:36,417 --> 00:05:37,917
HE ALREADY HAD ALL THE SHIPPING.

150
00:05:37,959 --> 00:05:40,125
ALL HE NEEDED
WAS FUTURE INDUSTRIES.

151
00:05:40,166 --> 00:05:42,917
- VARRICK HELPED SAVE
FUTURE INDUSTRIES.

152
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:46,041
HE'S MY BUSINESS PARTNER NOW,
NOT AN EVIL MASTERMIND.

153
00:05:46,083 --> 00:05:48,333
MAKO, YOU SEEM STRESSED.

154
00:05:48,375 --> 00:05:50,000
- I AM STRESSED!

155
00:05:50,041 --> 00:05:51,875
- SEE, THIS IS WHY
I HAD TO MOVE OUT.

156
00:05:51,917 --> 00:05:53,709
- YOU GUYS AREN'T
LIVING TOGETHER ANYMORE?

157
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:54,709
- NOPE.

158
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:56,166
IT WAS TIME FOR THIS EAGLE-HAWK

159
00:05:56,208 --> 00:05:59,583
TO SPREAD HIS WINGS
AND FLY.

160
00:05:59,625 --> 00:06:02,083
- SOUNDS LIKE YOU'VE HAD
A PRETTY BUSY WEEK.

161
00:06:02,125 --> 00:06:03,792
MAYBE YOU JUST NEED TO RELAX.

162
00:06:06,667 --> 00:06:08,709
- WAIT A MINUTE.

163
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:11,000
ARE YOU TWO--

164
00:06:11,041 --> 00:06:11,834
YOU'RE DATING AGAIN!

165
00:06:11,875 --> 00:06:13,083
WHAT?

166
00:06:13,125 --> 00:06:14,083
- DATING?
NO!

167
00:06:14,125 --> 00:06:15,083
- THAT'S CRAZY!

168
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:17,250
- KORRA JUST LEFT A WEEK AGO!

169
00:06:17,291 --> 00:06:19,792
- GUYS, LISTEN TO ME.

170
00:06:19,834 --> 00:06:22,333
VARRICK IS UP TO NO GOOD,
AND I HAVE PROOF.

171
00:06:22,375 --> 00:06:24,250
THE DETONATORS
HE USES IN HIS MOVERS

172
00:06:24,291 --> 00:06:25,625
ARE EXACTLY LIKE
THE ONE I FOUND

173
00:06:25,667 --> 00:06:27,125
AT THE CULTURAL
CENTER ATTACK.

174
00:06:27,166 --> 00:06:29,542
AND THOSE EXPLOSIONS
WERE EXACTLY LIKE THE ONES

175
00:06:29,583 --> 00:06:32,208
THE CAPTAIN REPORTED WHEN
ASAMI'S SHIPMENT WAS HIJACKED.

176
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:33,750
DON'T YOU SEE?

177
00:06:33,792 --> 00:06:35,000
- ANYONE COULD HAVE
GOTTEN THEIR HANDS

178
00:06:35,041 --> 00:06:36,000
ON ONE OF THOSE
DETONATORS.

179
00:06:36,041 --> 00:06:37,041
- YEAH.

180
00:06:37,083 --> 00:06:38,000
LET IT GO, MAKO.

181
00:06:38,041 --> 00:06:39,667

- IT'S A HIM,
AVATAR WAN.

361
00:14:33,041 --> 00:14:34,834
HE WAS AMAZING.

362
00:14:34,875 --> 00:14:37,083
I SAW HOW HE BECAME
THE FIRST AVATAR

363
00:14:37,125 --> 00:14:39,792
BY FUSING WITH RAAVA,
THE SPIRIT OF LIGHT.

364
00:14:39,834 --> 00:14:42,208
- THE AVATAR IS PART SPIRIT?

365
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:43,500
OF COURSE!

366
00:14:43,542 --> 00:14:45,041
JUST LIKE THE STATUE!

367
00:14:45,083 --> 00:14:46,667
- WHAT STATUE?

368
00:14:46,709 --> 00:14:48,333
- WHEN WE WERE
AT THE SOUTHERN AIR TEMPLE,

369
00:14:48,375 --> 00:14:50,792
I WAS DRAWN TO THIS OLD CARVING.

370
00:14:50,834 --> 00:14:53,041
I COULDN'T FIGURE OUT
WHAT IT WAS UNTIL NOW.

371
00:14:53,083 --> 00:14:54,917
IT WAS THE FIRST AVATAR.

372
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:56,375
- WHEN DID THIS HAPPEN?

373
00:14:56,417 --> 00:14:57,875
- IT WAS ON THE SOLSTICE.

374
00:14:57,917 --> 00:15:00,500
- THAT'S THE DAY
I OPENED THE SOUTHERN PORTAL.

375
00:15:00,542 --> 00:15:01,500
both: WHOA.

376
00:15:01,542 --> 00:15:02,709
[Oogi groans]

377
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:03,500
- WE'RE HERE!

378
00:15:07,458 --> 00:15:08,667
- ARE YOU SURE THESE SPIRITS

379
00:15:08,709 --> 00:15:10,291
ARE LEADING US
TO THE RIGHT PLACE?

380
00:15:10,333 --> 00:15:11,375
- OF COURSE!

381
00:15:11,417 --> 00:15:13,583
I TRUST BUM-JU WITH MY LIFE.

382
00:15:20,667 --> 00:15:23,166
- LOOK.

383
00:15:23,208 --> 00:15:25,333
- THERE ARE CARVINGS ON THEM.

384
00:15:25,375 --> 00:15:29,500
- THIS IS AN ANCIENT AIRBENDER
MEDITATION CIRCLE.

385
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:35,667
- THERE'S A LOT OF
SPIRITUAL ENERGY IN THIS PLACE,

386
00:15:35,709 --> 00:15:38,458
BUT IT FEELS REALLY STRANGE.

387
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:41,166
- WE'LL HAVE TO PERFORM
A SPIRITUAL CLEANSING CEREMONY.

388
00:15:41,208 --> 00:15:42,333
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

389
00:15:42,375 --> 00:15:43,917
- DAD TAUGHT IT TO ME.

390
00:15:43,959 --> 00:15:46,291
THIS SITE HAS BEEN NEGLECTED
FOR MANY YEARS.

391
00:15:46,333 --> 00:15:48,875
A CLEANSING CEREMONY WILL HELP
STRENGTHEN ITS CONNECTION

392
00:15:48,917 --> 00:15:50,083
TO THE SPIRIT WORLD.

393
00:16:04,834 --> 00:16:06,834
- GOOD JOB,
YOU CLEANSED THE AREA

394
00:16:06,875 --> 00:16:08,834
OF THE ONLY SPIRITS
THAT WANT TO HELP US,

395
00:16:08,875 --> 00:16:10,625
AND YOU SCARED AWAY BUM-JU.

396
00:16:17,208 --> 00:16:18,458
- IT'S WORKING.

397
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:21,417
[low rumbling]

398
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:27,250
boom!

399
00:16:27,291 --> 00:16:28,250
[screaming]

400
00:16:28,291 --> 00:16:31,208
[bats shrieking]

401
00:16:38,458 --> 00:16:41,375
[bats shrieking]

402
00:16:43,959 --> 00:16:45,542
- AH!
BATS!

403
00:16:45,583 --> 00:16:47,250
EVIL BATS!

404
00:16:47,291 --> 00:16:48,542
- NOT BATS.

405
00:16:48,583 --> 00:16:49,500
DARK SPIRITS!

406
00:17:01,083 --> 00:17:02,166
- WHAT ARE WE SUPPOSED TO DO?

407
00:17:33,792 --> 00:17:35,417
- AMAZING.

408
00:17:53,166 --> 00:17:55,792
- YOUR SPIRITUAL TRAINING
HAS COME A LONG WAY.

409
00:17:55,834 --> 00:17:57,375
- UNALAQ MAY BE
A HORRIBLE PERSON,

410
00:17:57,417 --> 00:17:59,458
BUT HIS SPIRIT POWERS
ARE NO JOKE.

411
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:02,750
- HE TAUGHT YOU HOW TO
TRANSFORM DARK SPIRITS.

412
00:18:02,792 --> 00:18:04,417
I CAN'T EVEN GET YOU
INTO THE SPIRIT WORLD.

413
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:07,500
- EVERYTHING UNALAQ TAUGHT ME
WAS TO HELP HIMSELF.

414
00:18:07,542 --> 00:18:10,417
EVERYTHING YOU'VE DONE
WAS MEANT TO HELP ME.

415
00:18:10,458 --> 00:18:15,291
I AM SO SORRY FOR TURNING
MY BACK ON YOU AS MY MENTOR.

416
00:18:15,333 --> 00:18:16,917
I NEED YOU NOW MORE THAN EVER.

417
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:19,458
- I WON'T LET YOU DOWN.

418
00:18:29,083 --> 00:18:31,417
THE ANCIENT AIRBENDERS
MUST HAVE BUILT THIS SITE.

419
00:18:33,208 --> 00:18:34,959
IF WE MEDITATE HERE,

420
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,417
WE'LL BE ABLE
TO ENTER THE SPIRIT WORLD.

421
00:18:37,458 --> 00:18:39,875
- WHY DON'T YOU GO FIRST?

422
00:18:39,917 --> 00:18:41,917
- AFTER ALL THESE YEARS,

423
00:18:41,959 --> 00:18:44,917
MY FATHER'S DREAM FOR ME
WILL FINALLY COME TRUE.

424
00:18:48,834 --> 00:18:50,333
[knocks on door]

425
00:18:52,875 --> 00:18:54,083
- HI.

426
00:18:54,125 --> 00:18:55,291
- DID YOU COME BY TO TELL ME

427
00:18:55,333 --> 00:18:56,750
HOW PARANOID I AM?

428
00:18:56,792 --> 00:18:58,291
- NO.

429
00:18:58,333 --> 00:19:00,083
I JUST WANTED TO COME BY
TO MAKE SURE YOU'RE OKAY.

430
00:19:00,125 --> 00:19:01,542
YOU SEEMED SO AGITATED EARLIER.

431
00:19:01,583 --> 00:19:02,917
- I'M FINE.

432
00:19:02,959 --> 00:19:04,417
- MAYBE YOU NEED A NIGHT OFF.

433
00:19:04,458 --> 00:19:06,083
WHY DON'T WE GO GET SOME DINNER?

434
00:19:06,125 --> 00:19:07,667
- NO, THANKS.

435
00:19:07,709 --> 00:19:08,709
I'M A LITTLE BUSY.

436
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:11,000
- TOO BUSY FOR KWONG'S CUISINE?

437
00:19:11,041 --> 00:19:12,208
REMEMBER?

438
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:13,834
WE HAD OUR FIRST DATE THERE.

439
00:19:13,875 --> 00:19:15,542
- MAYBE I DO NEED TO
GET MY MIND OFF THINGS.

440
00:19:17,166 --> 00:19:18,625
[knocks on door]

441
00:19:18,667 --> 00:19:19,583
- POLICE!

442
00:19:21,542 --> 00:19:22,917
HEY, MAKO.

443
00:19:22,959 --> 00:19:24,542
HOPE WE DIDN'T INTERRUPT
YOU TWO LOVEBIRDS.

444
00:19:26,166 --> 00:19:27,250
- WHAT'S GOING ON?

445
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:28,542
- WE BUSTED SOME TRIPLE THREATS

446
00:19:28,583 --> 00:19:29,875
WHO SAID YOU HIRED THEM
FOR A JOB.

447
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:32,709
- ALL RIGHT.

448
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:34,291
IT'S TRUE.

449
00:19:34,333 --> 00:19:36,750
WE WERE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT
WHO STOLE ASAMI'S STUFF,

450
00:19:36,792 --> 00:19:39,500
SO WE HIRED THEM
FOR A STING OPERATION.

451
00:19:39,542 --> 00:19:40,917
I'M SORRY FOR
GOING BEHIND YOUR BACK.

452
00:19:42,875 --> 00:19:44,291
- ACCORDING TO
THE TRIPLE THREATS,

453
00:19:44,333 --> 00:19:45,500
YOU DID MORE THAN THAT.

454
00:19:45,542 --> 00:19:47,000
THEY SAID YOU HELPED THEM STEAL

455
00:19:47,041 --> 00:19:48,750
A WAREHOUSE FULL OF
FUTURE INDUSTRIES PROPERTY.

456
00:19:48,792 --> 00:19:50,250
- THAT'S CRAZY!

457
00:19:50,291 --> 00:19:52,000
- YOU'RE GONNA BELIEVE
A BUNCH OF CRIMINALS?

458
00:19:52,041 --> 00:19:53,458
- I HAVE TO FOLLOW UP ON A LEAD.

459
00:19:55,625 --> 00:19:58,166
- WELL, LOOKY WHAT I FOUND:

460
00:19:58,208 --> 00:19:59,917
CASH...

461
00:19:59,959 --> 00:20:00,959
AND THESE.

462
00:20:02,583 --> 00:20:04,542
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING
WITH EXPLOSIVES, MAKO?

463
00:20:04,583 --> 00:20:06,291
- I DON'T KNOW
WHERE THOSE CAME FROM.

464
00:20:06,333 --> 00:20:07,834
- YOU'RE UNDER ARREST.

465
00:20:07,875 --> 00:20:10,000
- NONE OF THAT IS MINE.

466
00:20:10,041 --> 00:20:12,625
- SHOULD'VE KNOWN YOU'D HOOK UP
WITH YOUR OLD PALS.

467
00:20:12,667 --> 00:20:15,625
ONCE A TRIPLE THREAT,
ALWAYS A TRIPLE THREAT.

468
00:20:15,667 --> 00:20:17,625
- THIS HAS TO BE A MISTAKE.

469
00:20:17,667 --> 00:20:19,458
- SORRY TO BREAK THE NEWS
TO YOU, SWEETIE,

470
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:21,875
BUT YOUR BOYFRIEND'S
JUST A CROOKED COP.

471
00:20:21,917 --> 00:20:24,500
THAT STING OPERATION
WAS JUST A WAY

472
00:20:24,542 --> 00:20:25,959
TO LURE YOU AWAY
FROM YOUR WAREHOUSE.

473
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,417
[laughs]

474
00:20:27,458 --> 00:20:30,208
HE WAS USING YOU
THE WHOLE TIME.

475
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:31,500
- THAT'S NOT TRUE, ASAMI.

476
00:20:31,542 --> 00:20:33,583
I WOULD NEVER DO ANYTHING
TO HURT YOU.

477
00:20:33,625 --> 00:20:34,583
IT'S VARRICK.

478
00:20:34,625 --> 00:20:35,834
THIS IS ALL VARRICK.

479
00:20:35,875 --> 00:20:37,625
HE SET ME UP!

480
00:20:37,667 --> 00:20:39,959
- YEAH, IT'S VARRICK'S FAULT.

481
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,125
VARRICK.

482
00:20:41,166 --> 00:20:42,125
[laughs]

483
00:20:42,166 --> 00:20:43,709
VARRICK.

484
00:20:52,166 --> 00:20:54,250
- YOU IN THE SPIRIT WORLD YET?

485
00:20:54,291 --> 00:20:56,083
- NO, I AM NOT,

486
00:20:56,125 --> 00:20:58,041
AND STOP BUGGING ME.

487
00:20:58,083 --> 00:20:59,375
[wood clattering]

488
00:20:59,417 --> 00:21:01,417
- IT'S OKAY, TENZIN.

489
00:21:01,458 --> 00:21:03,083
MAYBE YOU WEREN'T MEANT TO
GUIDE KORRA

490
00:21:03,125 --> 00:21:04,625
INTO THE SPIRIT WORLD.

491
00:21:04,667 --> 00:21:07,667
- NO!
JUST GIVE ME SOME TIME.
- STOP BEING SO STUBBORN.

492
00:21:07,709 --> 00:21:09,917
IT'S NOT YOUR DESTINY.

493
00:21:09,959 --> 00:21:12,667
I THINK JINORA WAS MEANT TO
GUIDE THE AVATAR.

494
00:21:12,709 --> 00:21:15,083
- JINORA WILL NOT ENTER
THE SPIRIT WORLD!

495
00:21:15,125 --> 00:21:17,417
SHE'S NOT READY FOR THE DANGERS
OF THE OTHER SIDE,

496
00:21:17,458 --> 00:21:18,667
BUT I AM.

497
00:21:18,709 --> 00:21:20,458
I'VE SPENT YEARS TRAINING,
STUDYING,

498
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:22,208
AND MASTERING
EVERYTHING THERE IS TO KNOW

499
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:23,458
ABOUT THE SPIRIT WORLD.

500
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:25,750
- TENZIN, WE'RE RUNNING
OUT OF TIME.

501
00:21:25,792 --> 00:21:27,333
- IF EVERYONE
COULD JUST BE QUIET

502
00:21:27,375 --> 00:21:28,542
AND LET ME FOCUS.

503
00:21:30,458 --> 00:21:31,792
- AUNT KYA IS RIGHT.

504
00:21:31,834 --> 00:21:34,333
I CAN GUIDE KORRA
INTO THE SPIRIT WORLD.

505
00:21:34,375 --> 00:21:35,709
I'LL BE ALL RIGHT.

506
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:44,750
- PERHAPS I WILL NEVER HAVE
THE CONNECTION WITH SPIRITS

507
00:21:44,792 --> 00:21:46,792
LIKE I ALWAYS WANTED...

508
00:21:46,834 --> 00:21:49,875
LIKE MY FATHER
WANTED ME TO HAVE.

509
00:21:49,917 --> 00:21:51,875
- IT'S OKAY, DADDY.

510
00:21:51,917 --> 00:21:53,917
- I'M PROUD OF YOU.

511
00:21:53,959 --> 00:21:55,166
GO.

512
00:21:55,208 --> 00:21:56,542
CLOSE THE PORTAL.

513
00:21:56,583 --> 00:21:58,083
WE'LL WAIT HERE
AND KEEP YOUR BODIES SAFE

514
00:21:58,125 --> 00:21:59,542
TILL YOU RETURN.

515
00:21:59,583 --> 00:22:00,709
- WE'LL BE ALL RIGHT.

516
00:22:30,375 --> 00:22:31,750
THE SPIRIT WORLD.

517
00:22:33,875 --> 00:22:35,959
- THE AVATAR IS DEAD,

518
00:22:36,041 --> 00:22:38,542
AND WE CANNOT OPEN
THE NORTHERN PORTAL.

519
00:22:38,583 --> 00:22:40,625
I HAVE FAILED YOU, VAATU.

520
00:22:40,667 --> 00:22:43,625
- YOU HAVE NOT FAILED ME...

521
00:22:43,667 --> 00:22:45,000
YET.

522
00:22:45,041 --> 00:22:48,667
THE AVATAR STILL LIVES.

523
00:22:48,709 --> 00:22:50,458
- HOW DO YOU KNOW?

524
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:55,250
- EVEN THOUGH MY CONNECTION
TO RAAVA WAS SEVERED,

525
00:22:55,291 --> 00:22:58,083
I CAN STILL FEEL HER PRESENCE.

526
00:22:58,125 --> 00:23:02,959
- I'LL FIND HER.
- THE AVATAR WILL FIND YOU.

527
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,542
SHE HAS JUST ENTERED
THE SPIRIT WORLD.
