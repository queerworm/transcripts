1
00:00:06,841 --> 00:00:08,092
EARTH.

2
00:00:08,634 --> 00:00:09,844
FIRE.

3
00:00:10,511 --> 00:00:11,804
AIR.

4
00:00:12,096 --> 00:00:13,180
WATER.

5
00:00:14,348 --> 00:00:18,102
ONLY THE AVATAR CAN MASTER
ALL FOUR ELEMENTS

6
00:00:18,394 --> 00:00:20,438
AND BRING BALANCE
TO THE WORLD.

7
00:00:26,235 --> 00:00:28,529
AFTER KUVIRA HARVESTED
SPIRIT VINES FROM THE SWAMP,

8
00:00:28,612 --> 00:00:31,365
THE VINES IN REPUBLIC CITY
REACTED BY ABDUCTING PEOPLE.

9
00:00:31,449 --> 00:00:33,826
KORRA SAVED EVERYONE,
BUT ALL IS NOT WELL.

10
00:00:33,909 --> 00:00:35,661
VARRICK AND BOLIN RETURNED
TO WARN EVERYONE

11
00:00:35,745 --> 00:00:37,580
ABOUT KUVIRA'S
SPIRIT VINE SUPER WEAPON.

12
00:00:37,663 --> 00:00:38,873
NOW RAIKO WANTS TO MOUNT
A DEFENSE

13
00:00:38,956 --> 00:00:40,499
AGAINST THE EARTH EMPIRE.

14
00:00:40,583 --> 00:00:42,376
MEANWHILE, BOLIN, OPAL,
AND LIN ARE ON A MISSION

15
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:44,086
TO RESCUE SU BEIFONG
AND HER FAMILY,

16
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:46,047
WHO ARE BEING HELD CAPTIVE
BY KUVIRA.

17
00:00:56,807 --> 00:00:58,517
ALL RIGHT, LET'S DO THIS.

18
00:00:58,893 --> 00:01:01,395
SAVING THE BEIFONGS
AND SAVING OUR LOVE

19
00:01:01,562 --> 00:01:04,607
BECAUSE I VOW TO REPAIR
THE RIFT THAT HAS GROWN BETWIXT US

20
00:01:04,815 --> 00:01:06,317
AND MAKE US WHOLE AGAIN!

21
00:01:07,193 --> 00:01:08,694
YOU, ZIP IT NOW.

22
00:01:09,028 --> 00:01:10,905
I HAD ENOUGH OF YOUR BABBLE
ON THE RIDE IN.

23
00:01:10,988 --> 00:01:12,239
YES, MA'AM.

24
00:01:14,033 --> 00:01:16,952
KUVIRA TORE DOWN
ALL THE DOMES.

25
00:01:17,036 --> 00:01:18,871
WHY WOULD SHE DO THAT?

26
00:01:20,289 --> 00:01:22,416
SHE'S GOT A WHOLE BATTALION
OF TROOPS STATIONED THERE.

27
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,669
THERE'S NO WAY WE'LL BE ABLE TO SPOT
ANYTHING USEFUL FROM HERE.

28
00:01:25,753 --> 00:01:27,671
WE'LL HAVE TO GO IN
FOR A CLOSER LOOK.

29
00:01:27,963 --> 00:01:29,173
DON'T BOTHER.

30
00:01:29,256 --> 00:01:31,425
ALL THE PRISONERS
HAVE BEEN MOVED.

31
00:01:32,551 --> 00:01:33,928
UH, HEY, CHIEF.

32
00:01:34,011 --> 00:01:35,179
HEY, CHIEF.

33
00:01:35,763 --> 00:01:37,223
GRANDMA TOPH!

34
00:01:37,598 --> 00:01:39,600
YOU WERE ONLY UP TO MY WAIST

35
00:01:39,683 --> 00:01:41,769
THE LAST TIME
WE WERE TOGETHER.

36
00:01:42,311 --> 00:01:45,022
OH, MAN!
OH, I CAN'T!

37
00:01:45,189 --> 00:01:46,899
THIS CAN'T BE HAPPENING!

38
00:01:47,274 --> 00:01:49,193
WHAT?
DO YOU HAVE TO PEE OR SOMETHING?

39
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:51,612
NO, WELL, NOW MAYBE.

40
00:01:51,862 --> 00:01:53,614
YOU'RE MY HERO!
MY NAME IS BOLIN.

41
00:01:53,697 --> 00:01:55,699
I'M DATING YOUR GRANDDAUGHTER,
I MEAN, KIND OF.

42
00:01:56,158 --> 00:01:58,077
I MAY HAVE SCREWED THAT UP,
BUT THAT'S WHY I'M HERE,

43
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,161
AND YOU'RE MY HERO!

44
00:01:59,245 --> 00:02:00,746
OH, I SAID THAT.

45
00:02:00,955 --> 00:02:02,123
CAN I HAVE A HUG TOO?

46
00:02:02,206 --> 00:02:03,499
WHAT'S UP WITH HIM?

47
00:02:03,749 --> 00:02:04,917
HE'S AN ACTOR.

48
00:02:05,126 --> 00:02:07,086
SO YOU ALREADY CHECKED
THE CITY FOR SU?

49
00:02:07,628 --> 00:02:08,796
HOW DID YOU KNOW
SHE WAS CAPTURED?

50
00:02:09,213 --> 00:02:10,756
I'VE BEEN LIVING IN THE SWAMP

51
00:02:10,881 --> 00:02:13,717
AND KEEPING WATCH ON ZAOFU
THROUGH THE VINES.

52
00:02:14,135 --> 00:02:15,469
SURE, OKAY, MAKES SENSE.

53
00:02:15,636 --> 00:02:17,972
BY THE TIME I GOT HERE,
THEY WERE GONE.

54
00:02:18,305 --> 00:02:21,016
I SNOOPED AROUND TOWN
AND HEARD THAT THEY WERE TAKEN AWAY

55
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:23,185
TO SOME NEARBY PRISON CAMP.

56
00:02:23,519 --> 00:02:24,812
WHERE WOULD THAT BE?

57
00:02:25,271 --> 00:02:27,231
THERE'S A FACTORY
AND REEDUCATION FACILITY

58
00:02:27,314 --> 00:02:28,357
NOT TOO FAR AWAY.

59
00:02:28,649 --> 00:02:29,900
HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT?

60
00:02:30,109 --> 00:02:32,278
BOLIN USED TO WORK FOR KUVIRA.

61
00:02:32,361 --> 00:02:34,029
HOW DID YOU END UP DATING

62
00:02:34,113 --> 00:02:36,574
THE KIND OF DIPSTICK
WHO WORKS FOR KUVIRA?

63
00:02:36,991 --> 00:02:38,075
USED TO!

64
00:02:38,492 --> 00:02:41,120
IT'S NOT HIS SILVER TONGUE,
I CAN TELL YOU THAT.

65
00:02:41,745 --> 00:02:44,039
PLEASE TELL ME THIS ATTITUDE
ISN'T HEREDITARY.

66
00:02:47,418 --> 00:02:49,336
GRANDMA, THIS IS JUICY.

67
00:02:49,628 --> 00:02:51,881
AND I THOUGHT
APPA WAS SMELLY.

68
00:02:51,964 --> 00:02:54,758
WHY WOULD YOU CHOOSE
THIS LEAKY, NASTY THING?

69
00:02:55,176 --> 00:02:57,761
YOU DON'T CHOOSE YOUR BISON.
HE CHOOSES YOU.

70
00:02:58,012 --> 00:03:00,639
AND ONCE HE CHOOSES YOU,
YOU CAN'T CHANGE.

71
00:03:00,931 --> 00:03:02,766
BELIEVE ME.
I CHECKED.

72
00:03:04,101 --> 00:03:05,769
THE BORDERS ARE SECURE,
AND TROOPS ARE GUARDING

73
00:03:05,853 --> 00:03:07,146
THE RAIL LINES INTO THE CITY.

74
00:03:07,813 --> 00:03:09,940
SO WHAT HAVE YOU TWO GENIUSES
COME UP WITH

75
00:03:10,024 --> 00:03:11,066
TO FEND OFF KUVIRA?

76
00:03:11,483 --> 00:03:13,110
IT'S A FLYING MECHA-SUIT.

77
00:03:13,194 --> 00:03:16,071
ASAMI GOT THE IDEA FROM
WATCHING DRAGONFLY-HUMMINGBIRDS.

78
00:03:16,155 --> 00:03:19,200
YOU CAN TAKE OFF STRAIGHT UP,
FLY IN ANY DIRECTION.

79
00:03:19,283 --> 00:03:20,618
WHERE DOES THE SPIRIT RAY
COME OUT?

80
00:03:20,951 --> 00:03:22,661
IT DOESN'T HAVE A SPIRIT RAY.

81
00:03:22,953 --> 00:03:24,580
I'M TELLING YOU
WHAT I TOLD KUVIRA:

82
00:03:24,663 --> 00:03:26,832
THAT TECHNOLOGY
SHOULD NOT BE USED.

83
00:03:27,124 --> 00:03:29,585
IT'S ALREADY BEING USED
BY KUVIRA!

84
00:03:29,668 --> 00:03:32,671
I NEED SPIRIT VINE WEAPONS,
AND I NEED THEM NOW!

85
00:03:32,755 --> 00:03:35,841
NO. IT WAS KUVIRA'S HARVESTING
OF THE VINES IN THE SWAMP

86
00:03:35,925 --> 00:03:37,259
THAT CAUSED
THE REPUBLIC CITY VINES

87
00:03:37,343 --> 00:03:39,720
TO GO CRAZY
AND GRAB ALL THOSE PEOPLE.

88
00:03:39,803 --> 00:03:41,889
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE THE
BRIDGE BETWEEN THE TWO WORLDS.

89
00:03:41,972 --> 00:03:43,474
WHY CAN'T YOU HARVEST
THE VINES?

90
00:03:43,557 --> 00:03:45,059
I WON'T DO THAT,

91
00:03:45,142 --> 00:03:47,519
BUT MAYBE SINCE THE SPIRITS
LOVE REPUBLIC CITY SO MUCH,

92
00:03:47,603 --> 00:03:50,231
I CAN CONVINCE THEM TO HELP US
DEFEND IT SOMEHOW.

93
00:03:50,314 --> 00:03:51,565
HMM.

94
00:03:51,649 --> 00:03:53,817
OKAY, MAYBE WHILE THE
WEAPON GENIUSES

95
00:03:53,901 --> 00:03:56,403
AND THE SPIRIT BRIDGE
ARE GETTING READY FOR BATTLE,

96
00:03:56,487 --> 00:03:59,114
WE SHOULD BE EVACUATING
THE ORDINARY CITIZENS

97
00:03:59,198 --> 00:04:02,284
SO THAT IF KUVIRA ATTACKS,
THEY WON'T BE HURT.

98
00:04:02,868 --> 00:04:05,120
THAT'S ACTUALLY A GOOD IDEA.

99
00:04:05,704 --> 00:04:07,248
PRINCE WU, YOU WORK
WITH THE POLICE TO COORDINATE

100
00:04:07,331 --> 00:04:08,832
GETTING PEOPLE
OUT OF THE CITY.

101
00:04:08,999 --> 00:04:11,835
NOW EVERYONE GET TO IT.
I WANT DAILY UPDATES.

102
00:04:15,005 --> 00:04:17,341
NICE JOB IN THERE.
I'M PROUD OF YOU.

103
00:04:17,424 --> 00:04:18,801
YOU'RE STARTING TO ACT LIKE
THE KIND OF KING

104
00:04:18,884 --> 00:04:20,886
- I'D LIKE TO WORK FOR.
- THANKS.

105
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:23,472
AND IF KORRA BUYS
THIS "MAN OF THE PEOPLE" THING,

106
00:04:23,555 --> 00:04:24,974
I STILL MIGHT GET
TO DATE HER.

107
00:04:25,391 --> 00:04:26,934
YOU ALWAYS
HAVE TO RUIN IT.

108
00:04:27,101 --> 00:04:28,352
WHAT? COME ON!

109
00:04:28,644 --> 00:04:30,813
WHY DO YOU THINK
GUYS DO ANYTHING GREAT?

110
00:04:30,896 --> 00:04:32,356
TO PICK UP GIRLS.

111
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:33,607
EVERY WORK OF ART,

112
00:04:33,691 --> 00:04:36,610
EVERY SONG,
EVERY CITY EVACUATION...

113
00:04:36,694 --> 00:04:38,195
ALL FOR THE LADIES.

114
00:04:42,366 --> 00:04:45,703
ALL RIGHT, EVERYBODY,
LET'S TEST THE POWER CORE.

115
00:04:45,786 --> 00:04:47,955
I WANT EVERYTHING IN ORDER
FOR THE FULL DEMONSTRATION

116
00:04:48,038 --> 00:04:49,540
FOR KUVIRA TOMORROW.

117
00:04:49,707 --> 00:04:51,500
LOAD THE ENERGY CAPSULE.

118
00:04:55,254 --> 00:04:57,589
ZHU LI, INITIALIZE PHASE ONE.

119
00:05:08,684 --> 00:05:10,019
THERE'S A PROBLEM
WITH THE CONDENSER.

120
00:05:10,102 --> 00:05:11,603
IT'S BACKING UP.

121
00:05:12,062 --> 00:05:13,272
SHUT IT DOWN.

122
00:05:14,565 --> 00:05:17,026
I CAN'T.
THE OVERRIDE ISN'T WORKING.

123
00:05:17,109 --> 00:05:18,694
EVERYONE NEEDS TO EVACUATE.

124
00:05:18,777 --> 00:05:20,195
THIS THING IS GOING TO BLOW!

125
00:05:20,279 --> 00:05:22,406
EVERYONE GET OUT! NOW!

126
00:05:24,616 --> 00:05:26,910
COME ON, BAATAR!
IT'S TOO LATE!

127
00:05:39,965 --> 00:05:41,592
THIS CHANNELING RING
WAS CRACKED.

128
00:05:41,675 --> 00:05:43,761
THAT'S WHAT CAUSED THE
REACTION TO OVERLOAD.

129
00:05:44,094 --> 00:05:46,430
NOW WE'RE TAKING
THIS WHOLE THING APART TONIGHT

130
00:05:46,513 --> 00:05:47,806
AND CHECKING EVERYTHING.

131
00:05:48,098 --> 00:05:49,266
NOTHING IS TOO SMALL.

132
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:52,186
THIS HAS TO BE READY
BY TOMORROW.

133
00:05:56,815 --> 00:05:59,109
SO HOW LONG HAS IT BEEN SINCE
YOU TWO HAVE SEEN EACH OTHER?

134
00:05:59,401 --> 00:06:02,112
LITTLE WHILE NOW.
COUPLE OF YEARS.

135
00:06:02,196 --> 00:06:03,364
TRY 20.

136
00:06:03,447 --> 00:06:06,950
AH, TIME FLIES
WHEN YOU GET TO BE MY AGE.

137
00:06:07,034 --> 00:06:09,536
I'M SURPRISED
YOU CAME TO SAVE SU.

138
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:11,538
I THOUGHT YOU GUYS
DIDN'T GET ALONG.

139
00:06:11,622 --> 00:06:14,291
SU AND I FINALLY WORKED OUT
OUR OLD GRIEVANCES.

140
00:06:14,375 --> 00:06:17,586
GOOD, GLAD WE CAN PUT ALL THAT
BEHIND US.

141
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,922
RIGHT. "WE."

142
00:06:22,966 --> 00:06:25,260
OKAY, THERE'S THE FACTORY.

143
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:41,193
WHOA, THAT'S ONE BIG...

144
00:06:42,361 --> 00:06:43,362
THING.

145
00:06:47,074 --> 00:06:49,118
I THINK I KNOW WHERE THEY ARE.

146
00:06:49,201 --> 00:06:52,246
FEEL THAT CAVERN
A FEW STORIES DOWN?

147
00:06:52,329 --> 00:06:56,500
IT SEEMS EMPTY, BUT IT'S GUARDED
BY AN AWFUL LOT OF MECH.

148
00:06:57,459 --> 00:06:58,627
RIGHT.

149
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:01,755
WHY WOULD YOU NEED SOLDIERS
GUARDING AN EMPTY CAVERN?

150
00:07:01,839 --> 00:07:04,675
THEY MUST HAVE THEM IN SOME
KIND OF SUSPENDED PRISON,

151
00:07:04,758 --> 00:07:06,760
SO THEY CAN'T USE
THEIR EARTHBENDING.

152
00:07:08,137 --> 00:07:09,888
SOMEONE'S COMING.
HIDE!

153
00:07:20,774 --> 00:07:23,235
I DIDN'T EXPECT YOU
UNTIL TOMORROW.

154
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:25,028
I JUST WANTED TO CHECK IN

155
00:07:25,112 --> 00:07:27,114
TO MAKE SURE
EVERYTHING WAS ON TRACK.

156
00:07:27,197 --> 00:07:28,365
IT LOOKS WONDERFUL.

157
00:07:28,449 --> 00:07:30,826
WE'VE HAD
A FEW MINOR MALFUNCTIONS,

158
00:07:31,201 --> 00:07:33,954
BUT WE SHOULD BE READY
FOR THE TEST TOMORROW.

159
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:37,708
YOU'VE BEEN WORKING ON THIS
THE ENTIRE TIME, ZHU LI.

160
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:39,710
WHAT DO YOU THINK
THE PROBLEM IS?

161
00:07:39,877 --> 00:07:41,712
IT'S A VERY COMPLEX MACHINE.

162
00:07:41,795 --> 00:07:43,839
THERE ARE BOUND TO BE
SOME BUGS TO WORK OUT.

163
00:07:44,089 --> 00:07:46,800
BUT YOU'RE DOING EVERYTHING
YOU CAN TO FIX THOSE, CORRECT?

164
00:07:47,134 --> 00:07:48,760
OF COURSE, YOUR EMINENCE.

165
00:07:49,052 --> 00:07:50,471
SHE'S LYING.

166
00:07:52,264 --> 00:07:53,849
TELL THE TROOPS
AND FACTORY WORKERS

167
00:07:53,932 --> 00:07:55,726
TO ATTEND
TOMORROW'S DEMONSTRATION.

168
00:07:56,226 --> 00:07:59,605
I WANT THEM ALL TO WITNESS
THIS INCREDIBLE NEW WEAPON IN ACTION.

169
00:08:03,358 --> 00:08:04,693
WE SHOULD BE
THINKING OF A WAY

170
00:08:04,776 --> 00:08:07,029
TO TAKE OUT KUVIRA
WHILE WE HAVE THE CHANCE.

171
00:08:07,237 --> 00:08:09,114
OR AT LEAST DESTROY
THE CANNON.

172
00:08:09,239 --> 00:08:10,616
IF SHE TAKES THAT
TO REPUBLIC CITY,

173
00:08:10,699 --> 00:08:12,367
IT COULD OBLITERATE
EVERYTHING.

174
00:08:12,534 --> 00:08:16,371
I DIDN'T COME TO FIGHT
WITH KUVIRA OR DESTROY A CANNON.

175
00:08:16,538 --> 00:08:18,624
I'M HERE TO SAVE MY FAMILY.

176
00:08:19,249 --> 00:08:23,212
IT WILL TAKE EVERYTHING
WE HAVE JUST TO GET OUT ALIVE.

177
00:08:23,962 --> 00:08:25,047
HMM.

178
00:08:25,422 --> 00:08:27,674
KUVIRA WANTS
EVERY SINGLE ONE OF HER PEOPLE

179
00:08:27,758 --> 00:08:29,134
TO SEE THE WEAPON
TEST TOMORROW,

180
00:08:29,218 --> 00:08:32,095
SO THE FACTORY WILL BE
MOSTLY EMPTY THEN.

181
00:08:32,387 --> 00:08:34,139
THAT'S OUR BEST CHANCE
TO SNEAK IN

182
00:08:34,264 --> 00:08:36,058
AND FREE SU
WITHOUT BEING SPOTTED.

183
00:08:36,642 --> 00:08:38,018
GOOD THINKING, BOLIN.

184
00:08:38,101 --> 00:08:40,687
THANKS. I KIND OF
HAVE A HEADACHE NOW.

185
00:08:49,613 --> 00:08:51,281
EXCUSE ME, SPIRIT?

186
00:08:51,615 --> 00:08:52,908
CAN I TALK TO...

187
00:08:53,075 --> 00:08:54,451
AND YOU'RE GONE.

188
00:08:57,246 --> 00:08:59,248
JUST LIKE ALL
THE OTHER SPIRITS.

189
00:09:00,082 --> 00:09:01,875
THEY'RE ABANDONING THE CITY.

190
00:09:02,793 --> 00:09:04,461
SO LET ME ASK YOU
ABOUT METALBENDING.

191
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:06,964
SU TRIED TO TEACH ME, BUT
I COULDN'T GET THE HANG OF IT.

192
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:10,300
I USED TO HAVE AN ACADEMY
TO TRAIN METALBENDING.

193
00:09:10,425 --> 00:09:13,011
EVEN BLOCKHEADS LIKE YOU
CAN FIGURE IT OUT

194
00:09:13,136 --> 00:09:14,555
WITH THE RIGHT INSTRUCTION.

195
00:09:14,638 --> 00:09:17,349
YEAH, YOU'RE
A REAL SENSITIVE INSTRUCTOR.

196
00:09:17,432 --> 00:09:19,059
I DID LEARN HOW TO LAVABEND.

197
00:09:19,142 --> 00:09:20,477
REALLY?

198
00:09:20,644 --> 00:09:22,646
IT'S A VERY RARE ABILITY.

199
00:09:22,854 --> 00:09:25,065
MAYBE YOU DO HAVE SOME TALENT.

200
00:09:25,357 --> 00:09:28,151
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU THINK I'M TALENTED.

201
00:09:28,485 --> 00:09:30,654
THAT MEANS SO MUCH TO ME
COMING FROM MY HERO.

202
00:09:30,988 --> 00:09:32,823
YEAH, SHE'S REAL ENCOURAGING.

203
00:09:33,198 --> 00:09:35,701
HEY, I'M BLIND, NOT DEAF.

204
00:09:35,993 --> 00:09:38,453
SO HERE'S SOMETHING
I'VE ALWAYS BEEN CURIOUS ABOUT.

205
00:09:38,579 --> 00:09:39,663
WHO'S LIN'S DAD?

206
00:09:42,499 --> 00:09:44,251
HE WAS A GUY NAMED KANTO.

207
00:09:44,793 --> 00:09:47,546
NICE MAN, BUT IT DIDN'T REALLY
WORK OUT BETWEEN US.

208
00:09:50,465 --> 00:09:51,842
AND...

209
00:09:51,925 --> 00:09:53,093
OKAY.

210
00:09:54,011 --> 00:09:56,930
LIN, I CAN FEEL YOUR ENRAGED
BREATHING FROM HERE.

211
00:09:57,014 --> 00:09:59,766
JUST SAY WHAT YOU HAVE TO SAY,
AND LET'S GET IT OVER WITH.

212
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:01,393
JUST GET IT OVER WITH?

213
00:10:01,518 --> 00:10:02,853
YEAH, LET'S NOT LINGER
ON THE FACT

214
00:10:02,936 --> 00:10:04,396
THAT I GREW UP WITHOUT A DAD.

215
00:10:04,479 --> 00:10:06,607
NO NEED TO GET
ALL TOUCHY-FEELY ABOUT IT.

216
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:07,983
JUST ONE OF
THOSE THINGS, RIGHT?

217
00:10:08,066 --> 00:10:11,278
HEY, I FORGAVE YOU
FOR ALL YOUR GARBAGE

218
00:10:11,361 --> 00:10:14,489
A LONG TIME AGO,
AND SU AND I WORKED THINGS OUT.

219
00:10:14,865 --> 00:10:17,075
YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE
WHO WANTS TO HOLD ON

220
00:10:17,159 --> 00:10:20,662
TO THIS FAMILY DRAMA NONSENSE
FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE.

221
00:10:20,871 --> 00:10:22,122
FORGAVE ME FOR WHAT?

222
00:10:22,372 --> 00:10:24,541
AND NOT KNOWING MY DAD
IS NONSENSE TO YOU?

223
00:10:24,875 --> 00:10:26,209
IT WAS PRETTY IMPORTANT TO ME.

224
00:10:26,293 --> 00:10:29,046
AND UNTIL NOW,
YOU WOULD NEVER EVEN DISCUSS IT.

225
00:10:29,171 --> 00:10:31,381
YOU KNOW, AFTER SU AND I
PATCHED THINGS UP,

226
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:34,593
I THOUGHT, "MAYBE I SHOULD TRY
TO REACH OUT TO MOM."

227
00:10:34,885 --> 00:10:36,303
BUT NOW THAT
WE'RE TOGETHER AGAIN,

228
00:10:36,386 --> 00:10:38,555
I REMEMBER
WHY WE STOPPED TALKING.

229
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:39,973
YOU MAKE ME FURIOUS,

230
00:10:40,182 --> 00:10:41,433
AND YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW WHY.

231
00:10:41,516 --> 00:10:43,518
AND WHEN I TELL YOU,
YOU DON'T CARE.

232
00:10:43,894 --> 00:10:46,605
ONCE WE SAVE SU,
YOU AND I ARE FINISHED.

233
00:10:49,066 --> 00:10:51,485
IF THAT'S YOUR DECISION
AND IT MAKES YOU HAPPY,

234
00:10:51,568 --> 00:10:52,903
THEN FINE.

235
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,259
THE TEST IS ABOUT TO START.

236
00:11:16,343 --> 00:11:17,928
THEY'RE GOING TO BLOW UP
THAT EMPTY TOWN

237
00:11:18,011 --> 00:11:19,346
WE FLEW OVER YESTERDAY.

238
00:11:19,471 --> 00:11:20,639
YOU'RE CLEAR TO GO.

239
00:11:20,931 --> 00:11:22,891
COPY THAT.
WE'RE GOING IN.

240
00:11:33,402 --> 00:11:36,071
THE GUARDS ARE
ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THAT DOOR.

241
00:11:36,279 --> 00:11:38,031
WE'LL HAVE TO BE QUIET.

242
00:11:38,782 --> 00:11:40,158
SHOOT ME OVER
TO THE CAGE,

243
00:11:40,242 --> 00:11:41,576
AND I CAN SWING THEM BACK
ON MY CABLE.

244
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:43,537
BOLIN, YOU'LL HAVE
TO CATCH THEM

245
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:45,580
SINCE MOM WON'T BE ABLE
TO SEE THEM.

246
00:11:46,665 --> 00:11:47,791
READY?

247
00:12:17,654 --> 00:12:19,197
WE'LL GET YOU OUT
ONE AT A TIME.

248
00:12:19,281 --> 00:12:20,282
COME ON.

249
00:12:25,787 --> 00:12:26,830
I GOT YOU!

250
00:12:33,503 --> 00:12:36,047
CONGRATULATIONS
ON ALL OF YOUR HARD WORK.

251
00:12:36,339 --> 00:12:38,759
THIS WEAPON IS PROOF
THAT THE EARTH EMPIRE

252
00:12:38,842 --> 00:12:40,844
IS THE STRONGEST NATION
IN THE WORLD.

253
00:12:41,136 --> 00:12:44,556
AND BELIEVE ME,
THIS IS ONLY THE BEGINNING!

254
00:12:46,308 --> 00:12:47,934
FIRE THE WEAPON.

255
00:12:54,483 --> 00:12:55,484
WHAT'S WRONG?

256
00:12:55,734 --> 00:12:57,152
PROBABLY SOMETHING MINOR.

257
00:12:57,235 --> 00:12:59,279
I SHOULD BE ABLE
TO FIND THE PROBLEM.

258
00:13:02,324 --> 00:13:04,117
THE DISTRIBUTOR PIN IS GONE.

259
00:13:05,619 --> 00:13:07,621
I SWEAR I LOCKED IT IN PLACE
YESTERDAY.

260
00:13:07,746 --> 00:13:09,706
THERE'S NO WAY
IT COULD HAVE JUST FALLEN OUT.

261
00:13:09,956 --> 00:13:12,334
AND THIS COULD CAUSE
THE ENTIRE WEAPON TO FAIL?

262
00:13:12,417 --> 00:13:14,044
IT COULD CAUSE IT TO EXPLODE.

263
00:13:16,922 --> 00:13:18,548
WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT THIS?

264
00:13:18,673 --> 00:13:19,841
NOTHING.

265
00:13:30,268 --> 00:13:32,312
YOU SWORE YOUR LOYALTY TO ME,

266
00:13:32,395 --> 00:13:34,689
AND I GAVE YOU
A CHANCE AT GREATNESS.

267
00:13:34,773 --> 00:13:36,358
THIS IS HOW YOU REPAY ME?

268
00:13:37,609 --> 00:13:38,819
YOU'RE A MONSTER.

269
00:13:38,902 --> 00:13:40,153
I REGRET NOTHING.

270
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:43,990
CHAIN HER UP
IN THE TARGET TOWN.

271
00:13:44,074 --> 00:13:45,784
SHE CAN SEE
HOW THE WEAPON WORKS

272
00:13:45,951 --> 00:13:47,786
UP CLOSE AND PERSONAL.

273
00:13:48,745 --> 00:13:50,205
OH, NO.

274
00:13:54,751 --> 00:13:56,586
SWEETIE, IT'LL BE FINE.

275
00:13:56,753 --> 00:13:59,339
LIN WON'T DROP YOU,
AND BOLIN WILL CATCH YOU.

276
00:13:59,422 --> 00:14:01,383
NO, NO.
JUST GO.

277
00:14:01,633 --> 00:14:03,343
JUST LEAVE ME.
I'LL STAY HERE.

278
00:14:05,804 --> 00:14:07,597
SORRY, BUT I HAVE TO DO THIS.

279
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:11,434
AAH!

280
00:14:15,355 --> 00:14:16,523
HUH?

281
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:25,532
THE PRISON.
GET THERE NOW.

282
00:14:26,366 --> 00:14:27,617
SHOULD WE POSTPONE THE TEST?

283
00:14:27,784 --> 00:14:29,953
I DIDN'T COME ALL THIS WAY
TO STOP NOW.

284
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:31,454
FIRE WHEN READY.

285
00:14:31,538 --> 00:14:33,665
I WANT TO SEE
THAT TOWN DESTROYED.

286
00:14:50,682 --> 00:14:52,017
WE GOT 'EM.
WE'RE COMING OUT.

287
00:15:11,661 --> 00:15:12,746
MOM!

288
00:15:12,871 --> 00:15:14,164
DAD!

289
00:15:15,999 --> 00:15:17,000
THANK YOU.

290
00:15:18,335 --> 00:15:19,419
LET'S MOVE.

291
00:15:19,502 --> 00:15:21,504
KUVIRA CAUGHT ZHU LI
AND THREW HER IN THE TOWN.

292
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:23,673
WHAT? NO,
I HAVE TO GO SAVE HER.

293
00:15:23,924 --> 00:15:25,091
YOU CAN'T GO IN THERE, KID.

294
00:15:25,175 --> 00:15:26,968
IT'S SUICIDE.
KUVIRA'S ONTO US.

295
00:15:27,177 --> 00:15:28,428
WE'VE BEEN THROUGH
TOO MUCH TOGETHER.

296
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:29,930
I CAN'T LEAVE HER.

297
00:15:30,013 --> 00:15:33,016
TOPH, YOU SAID ZHU LI WAS
LYING ABOUT FIXING THE CANNON.

298
00:15:33,266 --> 00:15:34,935
SHE MUST HAVE BEEN
TRYING TO STOP IT.

299
00:15:35,018 --> 00:15:36,937
FOR ALL YOU KNOW,
SHE COULD JUST HAVE BEEN

300
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:39,439
COVERING HER BUTT
BECAUSE SHE MADE A MISTAKE.

301
00:15:39,689 --> 00:15:41,900
NO. ZHU LI DOESN'T
MAKE MISTAKES.

302
00:15:42,108 --> 00:15:43,151
YOU GUYS LEAVE.

303
00:15:43,234 --> 00:15:45,111
IF WE MAKE IT OUT,
WE'LL GET TO THE CITY SOMEHOW.

304
00:15:45,195 --> 00:15:46,404
BOLIN, NO!

305
00:15:52,827 --> 00:15:53,912
YOU GUYS GET OUT OF HERE.

306
00:15:54,037 --> 00:15:55,413
I HAVE TO GO WITH BOLIN.

307
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:01,044
COULD BE OUR BEST CHANCE
TO STOP KUVIRA.

308
00:16:01,127 --> 00:16:02,629
MAYBE TAKE OUT THAT WEAPON.

309
00:16:02,712 --> 00:16:04,339
WE CAN'T LET OPAL BE
THE COOLEST.

310
00:16:04,422 --> 00:16:06,925
IF YOU ALL WANT TO GET
YOURSELVES CAPTURED AGAIN

311
00:16:07,008 --> 00:16:09,052
OR WORSE,
THAT'S YOUR BUSINESS.

312
00:16:09,302 --> 00:16:10,762
I'M THROUGH.

313
00:16:10,887 --> 00:16:13,431
WATCH OUT FOR BAATAR SR.
AND HUAN.

314
00:16:16,768 --> 00:16:18,520
SO HOW HAVE YOU BEEN, MOTHER?

315
00:16:18,645 --> 00:16:21,064
I TOLD YOU
NEVER TO CALL ME THAT.

316
00:16:38,665 --> 00:16:41,167
SPIRITS, THIS IS THE AVATAR.

317
00:16:41,501 --> 00:16:43,503
PLEASE LISTEN TO ME.

318
00:16:43,586 --> 00:16:45,171
SINCE I OPENED THE PORTALS,

319
00:16:45,255 --> 00:16:47,590
SPIRITS AND HUMANS
HAVE LIVED HAPPILY TOGETHER

320
00:16:47,674 --> 00:16:49,134
IN REPUBLIC CITY.

321
00:16:49,384 --> 00:16:51,094
IT'S ALL I COULD
HAVE HOPED FOR.

322
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:53,054
I KNOW YOU FELT THE EFFECTS

323
00:16:53,138 --> 00:16:55,181
OF KUVIRA CUTTING DOWN
SPIRIT VINES.

324
00:16:55,265 --> 00:16:57,976
BUT NOW ISN'T THE TIME
FOR YOU TO FLEE THE CITY.

325
00:16:58,059 --> 00:17:00,395
IT'S TIME FOR YOU TO HELP ME
SAVE IT FROM KUVIRA,

326
00:17:00,478 --> 00:17:03,148
WHO WAS PERVERTING SPIRIT
POWER TO USE AS A WEAPON

327
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:04,941
AGAINST OTHER HUMANS.

328
00:17:05,025 --> 00:17:07,777
WE DON'T GET INVOLVED
WITH HUMAN WARS.

329
00:17:08,445 --> 00:17:10,030
SPIRITS WORKED WITH UNALAQ.

330
00:17:10,113 --> 00:17:13,950
HE WAS MISUSING VAATU'S POWER
DURING HARMONIC CONVERGENCE

331
00:17:14,159 --> 00:17:15,869
TO FORCE SPIRITS TO FIGHT YOU.

332
00:17:16,327 --> 00:17:17,871
IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT?

333
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:20,415
NO,
BUT AS THE AVATAR,

334
00:17:20,498 --> 00:17:22,208
I'M HOPING THAT
YOU WILL COME TO MY AID

335
00:17:22,292 --> 00:17:24,419
TO SAVE THE NEW WORLD
WE ALL SHARE.

336
00:17:24,669 --> 00:17:27,839
WHAT YOU WANT IS
EXACTLY WHAT KUVIRA WANTS,

337
00:17:27,964 --> 00:17:31,051
TO USE SPIRITS AS A WEAPON
IN A HUMAN WAR.

338
00:17:31,426 --> 00:17:33,094
THE ANSWER IS NO.

339
00:17:33,803 --> 00:17:34,804
WAIT!

340
00:17:34,888 --> 00:17:35,930
PLEASE, LISTEN.

341
00:17:36,014 --> 00:17:37,974
IF SPIRITS AND HUMANS
ARE GONNA LIVE TOGETHER,

342
00:17:38,058 --> 00:17:40,060
WE HAVE TO WORK
WITH EACH OTHER.

343
00:18:04,125 --> 00:18:05,168
OPAL?

344
00:18:05,335 --> 00:18:07,629
NO. WE HAVE
TO STOP THE TEST.

345
00:18:21,101 --> 00:18:22,602
WHOA.

346
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:41,704
AAH!

347
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:26,643
YOU GIVE METALBENDERS
A BAD NAME!

348
00:20:39,989 --> 00:20:41,866
THANKS FOR COMING TO SAVE US,
MOM.

349
00:20:41,991 --> 00:20:43,451
YEAH, THANKS, CHIEF.

350
00:20:44,327 --> 00:20:46,162
I'M SORRY
FOR WHAT I SAID LAST NIGHT.

351
00:20:46,371 --> 00:20:48,539
I WAS JUST...
YOU KNOW.

352
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:52,168
LOOK, I KNOW
I WASN'T A GREAT MOTHER,

353
00:20:52,293 --> 00:20:56,506
BUT ONE WAY OR ANOTHER,
I ENDED UP WITH TWO GREAT KIDS.

354
00:20:56,965 --> 00:21:00,218
GOOD ENOUGH TO RISK
MY BONY OLD BUTT FOR, ANYWAY.

355
00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:04,097
IF YOU CAN JUST FIND SOME WAY
NOT TO HATE ME,

356
00:21:04,347 --> 00:21:07,642
MAYBE THAT'S ENOUGH,
AT LEAST FOR ME.

357
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:10,645
ME TOO.

358
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:13,940
YOU KNOW, I NEVER HAD
ANY FAMILY EXCEPT FOR MY BROTHER

359
00:21:14,023 --> 00:21:15,358
UNTIL A FEW YEARS AGO,

360
00:21:15,441 --> 00:21:18,695
AND REUNITING WITH THEM
MADE ME REALIZE HOW SPECIAL IT IS...

361
00:21:18,778 --> 00:21:20,363
ARGH, ENOUGH.

362
00:21:20,571 --> 00:21:23,866
ENJOY THE RIDE BACK
TO THE CITY WITH THE GUM FLAPPER HERE.

363
00:21:24,158 --> 00:21:26,536
AREN'T YOU COMING BACK
TO REPUBLIC CITY WITH US, GRANDMA?

364
00:21:26,619 --> 00:21:29,706
NO, MY FIGHTING DAYS
ARE OVER.

365
00:21:30,206 --> 00:21:33,251
DON'T TELL KORRA,
BUT MY BACK IS KILLING ME NOW.

366
00:21:33,418 --> 00:21:35,378
THIS IS WHY
YOU DIDN'T SEE KATARA

367
00:21:35,503 --> 00:21:37,839
MESSING WITH
THAT CIVIL WAR NONSENSE.

368
00:21:38,089 --> 00:21:41,551
AT SOME POINT,
YOU GOTTA LEAVE IT TO THE KIDS.

369
00:21:42,343 --> 00:21:44,554
I WANT TO THANK YOU
FOR COMING BACK TO SAVE ME.

370
00:21:44,887 --> 00:21:47,390
AND DON'T BE TOO HARD ON BOLIN
FOR WORKING WITH KUVIRA.

371
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:49,100
HIS HEART WAS
IN THE RIGHT PLACE.

372
00:21:49,892 --> 00:21:51,811
I THINK
BOLIN HAS WORKED HIS WAY

373
00:21:51,894 --> 00:21:53,604
OUT OF THE POLAR
BEAR-DOGHOUSE.

374
00:21:53,730 --> 00:21:54,731
MWAH.

375
00:21:54,814 --> 00:21:56,733
YES!
HA-HA!

376
00:21:57,066 --> 00:21:58,443
WE SHOULD GET GOING.

377
00:21:58,526 --> 00:22:01,362
I'M AFRAID I HAVE BAD NEWS
TO DELIVER TO REPUBLIC CITY.

378
00:22:02,196 --> 00:22:04,907
KUVIRA IS GOING TO ATTACK
IN TWO WEEKS.
