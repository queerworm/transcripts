1
00:00:07,208 --> 00:00:09,291
- EARTH.

2
00:00:09,333 --> 00:00:11,125
FIRE.

3
00:00:11,166 --> 00:00:12,875
AIR.

4
00:00:12,917 --> 00:00:15,083
WATER.

5
00:00:15,125 --> 00:00:19,125
ONLY THE AVATAR CAN MASTER
ALL FOUR ELEMENTS

6
00:00:19,166 --> 00:00:22,083
AND BRING BALANCE
TO THE WORLD.

7
00:00:27,208 --> 00:00:29,417
- AFTER KUVIRA HARVESTED
SPIRIT VINES FROM THE SWAMP,

8
00:00:29,458 --> 00:00:32,208
THE VINES IN REPUBLIC CITY
REACTED BY ABDUCTING PEOPLE.

9
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:34,417
KORRA SAVED EVERYONE,
BUT ALL IS NOT WELL.

10
00:00:34,458 --> 00:00:36,333
VARRICK AND BOLIN RETURNED
TO WARN EVERYONE

11
00:00:36,375 --> 00:00:38,166
ABOUT KUVIRA'S
SPIRIT VINE SUPER WEAPON.

12
00:00:38,208 --> 00:00:39,500
NOW RAIKO WANTS TO MOUNT
A DEFENSE

13
00:00:39,542 --> 00:00:40,917
AGAINST THE EARTH EMPIRE.

14
00:00:40,959 --> 00:00:43,333
MEANWHILE, BOLIN, OPAL, AND LIN
ARE ON A MISSION

15
00:00:43,375 --> 00:00:44,959
TO RESCUE SU BEIFONG
AND HER FAMILY,

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,917
WHO ARE BEING HELD CAPTIVE
BY KUVIRA.

17
00:00:51,625 --> 00:00:53,583
[Juicy groans]

18
00:00:56,417 --> 00:00:57,625
[Juicy panting]

19
00:00:57,667 --> 00:00:59,583
- ALL RIGHT, LET'S DO THIS.

20
00:00:59,625 --> 00:01:02,250
SAVING THE BEIFONGS
AND SAVING OUR LOVE

21
00:01:02,291 --> 00:01:05,417
BECAUSE I VOW TO REPAIR THE RIFT
THAT HAS GROWN BETWIXT US

22
00:01:05,458 --> 00:01:08,083
AND MAKE US WHOLE AGAIN!

23
00:01:08,125 --> 00:01:09,834
- YOU, ZIP IT NOW.

24
00:01:09,875 --> 00:01:11,875
I HAD ENOUGH OF YOUR BABBLE
ON THE RIDE IN.
- YES, MA'AM.

25
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,875
- KUVIRA TORE DOWN
ALL THE DOMES.

26
00:01:17,917 --> 00:01:19,834
WHY WOULD SHE DO THAT?

27
00:01:20,959 --> 00:01:23,750
- SHE'S GOT A WHOLE BATTALION
OF TROOPS STATIONED THERE.

28
00:01:23,792 --> 00:01:26,875
THERE'S NO WAY WE'LL BE ABLE TO
SPOT ANYTHING USEFUL FROM HERE.

29
00:01:26,917 --> 00:01:28,500
WE'LL HAVE TO GO IN
FOR A CLOSER LOOK.

30
00:01:28,542 --> 00:01:29,709
- DON'T BOTHER.

31
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:32,417
ALL THE PRISONERS
HAVE BEEN MOVED.

32
00:01:32,458 --> 00:01:34,834
- UH, HEY, CHIEF.

33
00:01:34,875 --> 00:01:36,083
- HEY, CHIEF.

34
00:01:36,125 --> 00:01:38,166
- GRANDMA TOPH!

35
00:01:38,208 --> 00:01:40,458
- YOU WERE ONLY UP TO MY WAIST

36
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:42,667
THE LAST TIME
WE WERE TOGETHER.

37
00:01:42,709 --> 00:01:46,041
- OH, MAN!
OH, I CAN'T!

38
00:01:46,083 --> 00:01:48,000
THIS CAN'T BE HAPPENING!

39
00:01:48,041 --> 00:01:50,083
- WHAT?
DO YOU HAVE TO PEE OR SOMETHING?

40
00:01:50,125 --> 00:01:52,709
- NO, WELL, NOW MAYBE.

41
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:54,250
YOU'RE MY HERO!
MY NAME IS BOLIN.

42
00:01:54,291 --> 00:01:56,875
I'M DATING YOUR GRANDDAUGHTER,
I MEAN, KIND OF.

43
00:01:56,917 --> 00:01:59,000
I MAY HAVE SCREWED THAT UP,
BUT THAT'S WHY I'M HERE,

44
00:01:59,041 --> 00:02:00,083
AND YOU'RE MY HERO!

45
00:02:00,125 --> 00:02:01,750
OH, I SAID THAT.

46
00:02:01,792 --> 00:02:03,041
CAN I HAVE A HUG TOO?

47
00:02:03,083 --> 00:02:04,458
- WHAT'S UP WITH HIM?

48
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,000
- HE'S AN ACTOR.

49
00:02:06,041 --> 00:02:08,000
SO YOU ALREADY CHECKED THE CITY
FOR SU?

50
00:02:08,041 --> 00:02:09,834
HOW DID YOU KNOW
SHE WAS CAPTURED?

51
00:02:09,875 --> 00:02:11,667
- I'VE BEEN LIVING IN THE SWAMP

52
00:02:11,709 --> 00:02:14,500
AND KEEPING WATCH ON ZAOFU
THROUGH THE VINES.

53
00:02:14,542 --> 00:02:16,041
- SURE, OKAY, MAKES SENSE.

54
00:02:16,083 --> 00:02:19,083
- BY THE TIME I GOT HERE,
THEY WERE GONE.

55
00:02:19,125 --> 00:02:21,875
I SNOOPED AROUND TOWN AND HEARD
THAT THEY WERE TAKEN AWAY

56
00:02:21,917 --> 00:02:24,041
TO SOME NEARBY PRISON CAMP.

57
00:02:24,083 --> 00:02:25,667
- WHERE WOULD THAT BE?

58
00:02:25,709 --> 00:02:28,125
- THERE'S A FACTORY
AND REEDUCATION FACILITY

59
00:02:28,166 --> 00:02:29,125
NOT TOO FAR AWAY.

60
00:02:29,166 --> 00:02:30,667
- HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT?

61
00:02:30,709 --> 00:02:33,166
- BOLIN USED TO WORK FOR KUVIRA.

62
00:02:33,208 --> 00:02:34,834
- HOW DID YOU END UP DATING

63
00:02:34,875 --> 00:02:37,291
THE KIND OF DIPSTICK
WHO WORKS FOR KUVIRA?

64
00:02:37,333 --> 00:02:39,291
- USED TO!

65
00:02:39,333 --> 00:02:42,333
- IT'S NOT HIS SILVER TONGUE,
I CAN TELL YOU THAT.

66
00:02:42,375 --> 00:02:44,792
- PLEASE TELL ME THIS ATTITUDE
ISN'T HEREDITARY.

67
00:02:44,834 --> 00:02:48,208
[Juicy panting]

68
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:50,166
- GRANDMA, THIS IS JUICY.

69
00:02:50,208 --> 00:02:52,959
- AND I THOUGHT APPA WAS SMELLY.

70
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,834
WHY WOULD YOU CHOOSE
THIS LEAKY, NASTY THING?

71
00:02:55,875 --> 00:02:58,792
- YOU DON'T CHOOSE YOUR BISON.
HE CHOOSES YOU.

72
00:02:58,834 --> 00:03:01,750
AND ONCE HE CHOOSES YOU,
YOU CAN'T CHANGE.

73
00:03:01,792 --> 00:03:04,250
BELIEVE ME.
I CHECKED.

74
00:03:04,291 --> 00:03:06,750
- THE BORDERS ARE SECURE,
AND TROOPS ARE GUARDING

75
00:03:06,792 --> 00:03:08,291
THE RAIL LINES INTO THE CITY.

76
00:03:08,333 --> 00:03:10,709
SO WHAT HAVE YOU TWO GENIUSES
COME UP WITH

77
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:11,792
TO FEND OFF KUVIRA?

78
00:03:11,834 --> 00:03:14,166
- IT'S A FLYING MECHA-SUIT.

79
00:03:14,208 --> 00:03:17,208
ASAMI GOT THE IDEA FROM WATCHING
DRAGONFLY-HUMMINGBIRDS.

80
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:20,083
YOU CAN TAKE OFF STRAIGHT UP,
FLY IN ANY DIRECTION.

81
00:03:20,125 --> 00:03:21,542
- WHERE DOES THE SPIRIT RAY
COME OUT?

82
00:03:21,583 --> 00:03:23,917
- IT DOESN'T HAVE A SPIRIT RAY.

83
00:03:23,959 --> 00:03:25,542
I'M TELLING YOU
WHAT I TOLD KUVIRA:

84
00:03:25,583 --> 00:03:27,917
THAT TECHNOLOGY
SHOULD NOT BE USED.

85
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:30,375
- IT'S ALREADY BEING USED
BY KUVIRA!

86
00:03:30,417 --> 00:03:33,458
I NEED SPIRIT VINE WEAPONS,
AND I NEED THEM NOW!

87
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:36,834
- NO. IT WAS KUVIRA'S HARVESTING
OF THE VINES IN THE SWAMP

88
00:03:36,875 --> 00:03:38,166
THAT CAUSED
THE REPUBLIC CITY VINES

89
00:03:38,208 --> 00:03:40,542
TO GO CRAZY
AND GRAB ALL THOSE PEOPLE.

90
00:03:40,583 --> 00:03:42,875
- YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE THE
BRIDGE BETWEEN THE TWO WORLDS.

91
00:03:42,917 --> 00:03:44,375
WHY CAN'T YOU HARVEST THE VINES?

92
00:03:44,417 --> 00:03:46,125
- I WON'T DO THAT,

93
00:03:46,166 --> 00:03:48,458
BUT MAYBE SINCE THE SPIRITS
LOVE REPUBLIC CITY SO MUCH,

94
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:51,041
I CAN CONVINCE THEM TO HELP US
DEFEND IT SOMEHOW.

95
00:03:51,083 --> 00:03:52,458
- HMM.

96
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,542
- OKAY,
MAYBE WHILE THE WEAPON GENIUSES

97
00:03:54,583 --> 00:03:57,291
AND THE SPIRIT BRIDGE
ARE GETTING READY FOR BATTLE,

98
00:03:57,333 --> 00:04:00,250
WE SHOULD BE EVACUATING
THE ORDINARY CITIZENS

99
00:04:00,291 --> 00:04:03,083
SO THAT IF KUVIRA ATTACKS,
THEY WON'T BE HURT.

100
00:04:03,125 --> 00:04:06,291
- THAT'S ACTUALLY A GOOD IDEA.

101
00:04:06,333 --> 00:04:07,959
PRINCE WU, YOU WORK
WITH THE POLICE TO COORDINATE

102
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,750
GETTING PEOPLE OUT OF THE CITY.

103
00:04:09,792 --> 00:04:12,709
NOW EVERYONE GET TO IT.
I WANT DAILY UPDATES.

104
00:04:15,834 --> 00:04:18,208
- NICE JOB IN THERE.
I'M PROUD OF YOU.

105
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:19,834
YOU'RE STARTING TO ACT LIKE
THE KIND OF KING

106
00:04:19,875 --> 00:04:21,834
I'D LIKE TO WORK FOR.
- THANKS.

107
00:04:21,875 --> 00:04:24,291
AND IF KORRA BUYS
THIS "MAN OF THE PEOPLE" THING,

108
00:04:24,333 --> 00:04:25,875
I STILL MIGHT GET TO DATE HER.

109
00:04:25,917 --> 00:04:27,542
- YOU ALWAYS HAVE TO RUIN IT.

110
00:04:27,583 --> 00:04:29,083
- WHAT? COME ON!

111
00:04:29,125 --> 00:04:31,458
WHY DO YOU THINK
GUYS DO ANYTHING GREAT?

112
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:33,125
TO PICK UP GIRLS.

113
00:04:33,166 --> 00:04:34,333
EVERY WORK OF ART,

114
00:04:34,375 --> 00:04:37,417
EVERY SONG,
EVERY CITY EVACUATION

115
00:04:37,458 --> 00:04:39,875
ALL FOR THE LADIES.

116
00:04:43,417 --> 00:04:46,166
- ALL RIGHT, EVERYBODY,
LET'S TEST THE POWER CORE.

117
00:04:46,208 --> 00:04:48,583
I WANT EVERYTHING IN ORDER
FOR THE FULL DEMONSTRATION

118
00:04:48,625 --> 00:04:50,375
FOR KUVIRA TOMORROW.

119
00:04:50,417 --> 00:04:52,000
LOAD THE ENERGY CAPSULE.

120
00:04:55,709 --> 00:04:58,917
ZHU LI, INITIALIZE PHASE ONE.

121
00:05:09,166 --> 00:05:10,667
- THERE'S A PROBLEM
WITH THE CONDENSER.

122
00:05:10,709 --> 00:05:12,583
IT'S BACKING UP.

123
00:05:12,625 --> 00:05:15,375
- SHUT IT DOWN.

124
00:05:15,417 --> 00:05:17,667
- I CAN'T.
THE OVERRIDE ISN'T WORKING.

125
00:05:17,709 --> 00:05:19,500
EVERYONE NEEDS TO EVACUATE.

126
00:05:19,542 --> 00:05:20,834
THIS THING IS GOING TO BLOW!

127
00:05:20,875 --> 00:05:23,083
- EVERYONE GET OUT! NOW!

128
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:28,875
- COME ON, BAATAR!
IT'S TOO LATE!

129
00:05:40,834 --> 00:05:42,417
- THIS CHANNELING RING
WAS CRACKED.

130
00:05:42,458 --> 00:05:44,583
THAT'S WHAT CAUSED THE REACTION
TO OVERLOAD.

131
00:05:44,625 --> 00:05:47,375
NOW WE'RE TAKING
THIS WHOLE THING APART TONIGHT

132
00:05:47,417 --> 00:05:48,625
AND CHECKING EVERYTHING.

133
00:05:48,667 --> 00:05:50,000
NOTHING IS TOO SMALL.

134
00:05:50,041 --> 00:05:53,375
THIS HAS TO BE READY
BY TOMORROW.

135
00:05:53,417 --> 00:05:57,208
[Juicy groaning]

136
00:05:57,250 --> 00:06:00,000
- SO HOW LONG HAS IT BEEN SINCE
YOU TWO HAVE SEEN EACH OTHER?

137
00:06:00,041 --> 00:06:02,709
- LITTLE WHILE NOW.
COUPLE OF YEARS.

138
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:04,083
- TRY 20.

139
00:06:04,125 --> 00:06:07,875
- AH, TIME FLIES
WHEN YOU GET TO BE MY AGE.

140
00:06:07,917 --> 00:06:10,333
I'M SURPRISED
YOU CAME TO SAVE SU.

141
00:06:10,375 --> 00:06:12,291
I THOUGHT YOU GUYS
DIDN'T GET ALONG.

142
00:06:12,333 --> 00:06:15,208
- SU AND I FINALLY WORKED OUT
OUR OLD GRIEVANCES.

143
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:18,583
- GOOD, GLAD WE CAN PUT ALL THAT
BEHIND US.

144
00:06:18,625 --> 00:06:20,709
- RIGHT. "WE."

145
00:06:23,709 --> 00:06:25,625
- OKAY, THERE'S THE FACTORY.

146
00:06:39,125 --> 00:06:44,709
- WHOA, THAT'S ONE BIG...
THING.

147
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:49,959
- I THINK I KNOW WHERE THEY ARE.

148
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,125
FEEL THAT CAVERN
A FEW STORIES DOWN?

149
00:06:53,166 --> 00:06:57,166
IT SEEMS EMPTY, BUT IT'S GUARDED
BY AN AWFUL LOT OF MECH.

150
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:00,166
- RIGHT.

151
00:07:00,208 --> 00:07:02,500
WHY WOULD YOU NEED SOLDIERS
GUARDING AN EMPTY CAVERN?

152
00:07:02,542 --> 00:07:05,458
THEY MUST HAVE THEM IN SOME KIND
OF SUSPENDED PRISON,

153
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:07,458
SO THEY CAN'T USE
THEIR EARTHBENDING.

154
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:08,917
[door opens]

155
00:07:08,959 --> 00:07:10,875
- SOMEONE'S COMING.
HIDE!

156
00:07:21,208 --> 00:07:23,709
- I DIDN'T EXPECT YOU
UNTIL TOMORROW.

157
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:25,458
- I JUST WANTED TO CHECK IN

158
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:27,542
TO MAKE SURE
EVERYTHING WAS ON TRACK.

159
00:07:27,583 --> 00:07:29,250
IT LOOKS WONDERFUL.

160
00:07:29,291 --> 00:07:31,500
- WE'VE HAD
A FEW MINOR MALFUNCTIONS,

161
00:07:31,542 --> 00:07:35,417
BUT WE SHOULD BE READY
FOR THE TEST TOMORROW.

162
00:07:35,458 --> 00:07:38,208
- YOU'VE BEEN WORKING ON THIS
THE ENTIRE TIME, ZHU LI.

163
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:40,208
WHAT DO YOU THINK
THE PROBLEM IS?

164
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:42,166
- IT'S A VERY COMPLEX MACHINE.

165
00:07:42,208 --> 00:07:44,291
THERE ARE BOUND TO BE
SOME BUGS TO WORK OUT.

166
00:07:44,333 --> 00:07:47,375
- BUT YOU'RE DOING EVERYTHING
YOU CAN TO FIX THOSE, CORRECT?

167
00:07:47,417 --> 00:07:49,500
- OF COURSE, YOUR EMINENCE.

168
00:07:49,542 --> 00:07:52,500
- SHE'S LYING.

169
00:07:52,542 --> 00:07:54,250
- TELL THE TROOPS
AND FACTORY WORKERS

170
00:07:54,291 --> 00:07:56,417
TO ATTEND
TOMORROW'S DEMONSTRATION.

171
00:07:56,458 --> 00:08:00,041
I WANT THEM ALL TO WITNESS THIS
INCREDIBLE NEW WEAPON IN ACTION.

172
00:08:03,709 --> 00:08:05,166
- WE SHOULD BE THINKING OF A WAY

173
00:08:05,208 --> 00:08:07,542
TO TAKE OUT KUVIRA
WHILE WE HAVE THE CHANCE.

174
00:08:07,583 --> 00:08:09,583
- OR AT LEAST DESTROY
THE CANNON.

175
00:08:09,625 --> 00:08:10,750
IF SHE TAKES THAT
TO REPUBLIC CITY,

176
00:08:10,792 --> 00:08:12,458
IT COULD OBLITERATE EVERYTHING.

177
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:16,875
- I DIDN'T COME TO FIGHT
WITH KUVIRA OR DESTROY A CANNON.

178
00:08:16,917 --> 00:08:19,458
I'M HERE TO SAVE MY FAMILY.

179
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:23,917
IT WILL TAKE EVERYTHING WE HAVE
JUST TO GET OUT ALIVE.

180
00:08:23,959 --> 00:08:25,792
- HMM.

181
00:08:25,834 --> 00:08:27,792
KUVIRA WANTS
EVERY SINGLE ONE OF HER PEOPLE

182
00:08:27,834 --> 00:08:29,500
TO SEE THE WEAPON TEST TOMORROW,

183
00:08:29,542 --> 00:08:32,709
SO THE FACTORY WILL BE
MOSTLY EMPTY THEN.

184
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:34,583
THAT'S OUR BEST CHANCE
TO SNEAK IN

185
00:08:34,625 --> 00:08:36,667
AND FREE SU
WITHOUT BEING SPOTTED.

186
00:08:36,709 --> 00:08:38,375
- GOOD THINKING, BOLIN.

187
00:08:38,417 --> 00:08:41,333
- THANKS.
I KIND OF HAVE A HEADACHE NOW.

188
00:08:49,583 --> 00:08:51,875
- EXCUSE ME, SPIRIT?

189
00:08:51,917 --> 00:08:53,417
CAN I TALK TO--

190
00:08:53,458 --> 00:08:56,000
AND YOU'RE GONE.

191
00:08:57,875 --> 00:09:00,375
JUST LIKE ALL THE OTHER SPIRITS.

192
00:09:00,417 --> 00:09:02,750
THEY'RE ABANDONING THE CITY.

193
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:05,083
- SO LET ME ASK YOU
ABOUT METALBENDING.

194
00:09:05,125 --> 00:09:07,458
SU TRIED TO TEACH ME, BUT
I COULDN'T GET THE HANG OF IT.

195
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:10,750
- I USED TO HAVE AN ACADEMY
TO TRAIN METALBENDING.

196
00:09:10,792 --> 00:09:13,291
EVEN BLOCKHEADS LIKE YOU
CAN FIGURE IT OUT

197
00:09:13,333 --> 00:09:15,041
WITH THE RIGHT INSTRUCTION.

198
00:09:15,083 --> 00:09:17,792
- YEAH, YOU'RE
A REAL SENSITIVE INSTRUCTOR.

199
00:09:17,834 --> 00:09:19,458
- I DID LEARN HOW TO LAVABEND.

200
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,000
- REALLY?

201
00:09:21,041 --> 00:09:23,208
IT'S A VERY RARE ABILITY.

202
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:25,667
MAYBE YOU DO HAVE SOME TALENT.

203
00:09:25,709 --> 00:09:28,792
- I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU THINK I'M TALENTED.

204
00:09:28,834 --> 00:09:31,125
THAT MEANS SO MUCH TO ME
COMING FROM MY HERO.

205
00:09:31,166 --> 00:09:33,375
- YEAH, SHE'S REAL ENCOURAGING.

206
00:09:33,417 --> 00:09:36,166
- HEY, I'M BLIND, NOT DEAF.

207
00:09:36,208 --> 00:09:38,834
- SO HERE'S SOMETHING
I'VE ALWAYS BEEN CURIOUS ABOUT.

208
00:09:38,875 --> 00:09:41,250
WHO'S LIN'S DAD?

209
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:44,875
- HE WAS A GUY NAMED KANTO.

210
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:48,083
NICE MAN, BUT IT DIDN'T REALLY
WORK OUT BETWEEN US.

211
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:52,041
- AND...

212
00:09:52,083 --> 00:09:54,500
OKAY.

213
00:09:54,542 --> 00:09:57,333
- LIN, I CAN FEEL YOUR ENRAGED
BREATHING FROM HERE.

214
00:09:57,375 --> 00:10:00,250
JUST SAY WHAT YOU HAVE TO SAY,
AND LET'S GET IT OVER WITH.

215
00:10:00,291 --> 00:10:01,625
- JUST GET IT OVER WITH?

216
00:10:01,667 --> 00:10:03,291
YEAH, LET'S NOT LINGER
ON THE FACT

217
00:10:03,333 --> 00:10:04,709
THAT I GREW UP WITHOUT A DAD.

218
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:06,875
NO NEED TO GET
ALL TOUCHY-FEELY ABOUT IT.

219
00:10:06,917 --> 00:10:08,208
JUST ONE OF THOSE THINGS, RIGHT?

220
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:11,458
- HEY, I FORGAVE YOU
FOR ALL YOUR GARBAGE

221
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:15,333
A LONG TIME AGO,
AND SU AND I WORKED THINGS OUT.

222
00:10:15,375 --> 00:10:17,417
YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE
WHO WANTS TO HOLD ON

223
00:10:17,458 --> 00:10:21,083
TO THIS FAMILY DRAMA NONSENSE
FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE.

224
00:10:21,125 --> 00:10:22,542
- FORGAVE ME FOR WHAT?

225
00:10:22,583 --> 00:10:24,959
AND NOT KNOWING MY DAD
IS NONSENSE TO YOU?

226
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,709
IT WAS PRETTY IMPORTANT TO ME.

227
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:29,458
AND UNTIL NOW,
YOU WOULD NEVER EVEN DISCUSS IT.

228
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:31,625
YOU KNOW, AFTER SU AND I
PATCHED THINGS UP,

229
00:10:31,667 --> 00:10:35,208
I THOUGHT, "MAYBE I SHOULD TRY
TO REACH OUT TO MOM."

230
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:36,542
BUT NOW THAT
WE'RE TOGETHER AGAIN,

231
00:10:36,583 --> 00:10:38,709
I REMEMBER
WHY WE STOPPED TALKING.

232
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:40,250
YOU MAKE ME FURIOUS,

233
00:10:40,291 --> 00:10:41,709
AND YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW WHY.

234
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:44,250
AND WHEN I TELL YOU,
YOU DON'T CARE.

235
00:10:44,291 --> 00:10:47,500
ONCE WE SAVE SU,
YOU AND I ARE FINISHED.

236
00:10:47,542 --> 00:10:49,208
- [sighs]

237
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:51,583
IF THAT'S YOUR DECISION
AND IT MAKES YOU HAPPY,

238
00:10:51,625 --> 00:10:53,166
THEN FINE.

239
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:16,458
- THE TEST IS ABOUT TO START.

240
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,000
THEY'RE GOING TO BLOW UP
THAT EMPTY TOWN

241
00:11:18,041 --> 00:11:19,667
WE FLEW OVER YESTERDAY.

242
00:11:19,709 --> 00:11:21,000
YOU'RE CLEAR TO GO.

243
00:11:21,041 --> 00:11:22,959
- COPY THAT.
WE'RE GOING IN.

244
00:11:33,458 --> 00:11:36,417
- THE GUARDS ARE
ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THAT DOOR.

245
00:11:36,458 --> 00:11:38,667
WE'LL HAVE TO BE QUIET.

246
00:11:38,709 --> 00:11:40,583
- SHOOT ME OVER TO THE CAGE,

247
00:11:40,625 --> 00:11:41,959
AND I CAN SWING THEM BACK
ON MY CABLE.

248
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,792
BOLIN, YOU'LL HAVE TO CATCH THEM

249
00:11:43,834 --> 00:11:46,792
SINCE MOM WON'T BE ABLE
TO SEE THEM.

250
00:11:46,834 --> 00:11:48,166
READY?

251
00:11:55,959 --> 00:11:58,583
[all grunting]

252
00:12:15,166 --> 00:12:17,834
[metallic clang]

253
00:12:17,875 --> 00:12:19,834
- WE'LL GET YOU OUT
ONE AT A TIME.

254
00:12:19,875 --> 00:12:20,792
COME ON.

255
00:12:25,458 --> 00:12:26,417
- I GOT YOU!

256
00:12:26,458 --> 00:12:29,208
[grunts]

257
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:36,542
- CONGRATULATIONS
ON ALL OF YOUR HARD WORK.

258
00:12:36,583 --> 00:12:39,041
THIS WEAPON IS PROOF
THAT THE EARTH EMPIRE

259
00:12:39,083 --> 00:12:41,125
IS THE STRONGEST NATION
IN THE WORLD.

260
00:12:41,166 --> 00:12:45,083
AND BELIEVE ME,
THIS IS ONLY THE BEGINNING!

261
00:12:45,125 --> 00:12:46,083
[crowd cheering]

262
00:12:46,125 --> 00:12:48,083
FIRE THE WEAPON.

263
00:12:53,291 --> 00:12:54,417
[alarm beeping]

264
00:12:54,458 --> 00:12:55,583
WHAT'S WRONG?

265
00:12:55,625 --> 00:12:57,083
- PROBABLY SOMETHING MINOR.

266
00:12:57,125 --> 00:12:59,291
I SHOULD BE ABLE
TO FIND THE PROBLEM.

267
00:12:59,333 --> 00:13:02,583
[machine powers down]

268
00:13:02,625 --> 00:13:05,667
THE DISTRIBUTOR PIN IS GONE.

269
00:13:05,709 --> 00:13:08,125
I SWEAR I LOCKED IT IN PLACE
YESTERDAY.

270
00:13:08,166 --> 00:13:10,083
THERE'S NO WAY
IT COULD HAVE JUST FALLEN OUT.

271
00:13:10,125 --> 00:13:12,709
- AND THIS COULD CAUSE
THE ENTIRE WEAPON TO FAIL?

272
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:14,625
- IT COULD CAUSE IT TO EXPLODE.

273
00:13:17,375 --> 00:13:18,959
- WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT THIS?

274
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,250
- NOTHING.

275
00:13:30,417 --> 00:13:32,667
- YOU SWORE YOUR LOYALTY TO ME,

276
00:13:32,709 --> 00:13:35,083
AND I GAVE YOU
A CHANCE AT GREATNESS.

277
00:13:35,125 --> 00:13:37,667
THIS IS HOW YOU REPAY ME?

278
00:13:37,709 --> 00:13:38,959
- YOU'RE A MONSTER.

279
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,834
I REGRET NOTHING.

280
00:13:41,875 --> 00:13:44,250
- CHAIN HER UP
IN THE TARGET TOWN.

281
00:13:44,291 --> 00:13:46,333
SHE CAN SEE
HOW THE WEAPON WORKS

282
00:13:46,375 --> 00:13:48,625
UP CLOSE AND PERSONAL.

283
00:13:48,667 --> 00:13:50,375
- OH, NO.

284
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:56,667
- SWEETIE, IT'LL BE FINE.

285
00:13:56,709 --> 00:13:59,291
LIN WON'T DROP YOU,
AND BOLIN WILL CATCH YOU.

286
00:13:59,333 --> 00:14:01,709
- NO, NO.
JUST GO.

287
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:05,709
JUST LEAVE ME.
I'LL STAY HERE.

288
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:09,875
- SORRY, BUT I HAVE TO DO THIS.

289
00:14:09,917 --> 00:14:11,875
- AAH!

290
00:14:11,917 --> 00:14:15,166
[shouts]

291
00:14:15,208 --> 00:14:16,417
- HUH?

292
00:14:16,458 --> 00:14:20,875
[alarm blaring]

293
00:14:20,917 --> 00:14:22,792
- [whimpering]

294
00:14:22,834 --> 00:14:26,250
- THE PRISON.
GET THERE NOW.

295
00:14:26,291 --> 00:14:27,792
- SHOULD WE POSTPONE THE TEST?

296
00:14:27,834 --> 00:14:30,125
- I DIDN'T COME ALL THIS WAY
TO STOP NOW.

297
00:14:30,166 --> 00:14:31,458
FIRE WHEN READY.

298
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:34,333
I WANT TO SEE
THAT TOWN DESTROYED.

299
00:14:45,333 --> 00:14:47,917
[cage crashes]

300
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:52,500
- WE GOT 'EM.
WE'RE COMING OUT.

301
00:15:07,834 --> 00:15:09,125
- [blows]

302
00:15:09,166 --> 00:15:11,250
[Juicy grumbles]

303
00:15:11,291 --> 00:15:13,208
- MOM!

304
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:16,917
DAD!

305
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:18,917
THANK YOU.

306
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:20,625
- LET'S MOVE.

307
00:15:20,667 --> 00:15:22,417
- KUVIRA CAUGHT ZHU LI
AND THREW HER IN THE TOWN.

308
00:15:22,458 --> 00:15:24,500
- WHAT?
NO, I HAVE TO GO SAVE HER.

309
00:15:24,542 --> 00:15:25,917
- YOU CAN'T GO IN THERE, KID.

310
00:15:25,959 --> 00:15:27,834
IT'S SUICIDE.
KUVIRA'S ONTO US.

311
00:15:27,875 --> 00:15:29,166
- WE'VE BEEN THROUGH
TOO MUCH TOGETHER.

312
00:15:29,208 --> 00:15:30,750
I CAN'T LEAVE HER.

313
00:15:30,792 --> 00:15:33,667
TOPH, YOU SAID ZHU LI WAS LYING
ABOUT FIXING THE CANNON.

314
00:15:33,709 --> 00:15:35,583
SHE MUST HAVE BEEN
TRYING TO STOP IT.

315
00:15:35,625 --> 00:15:37,583
- FOR ALL YOU KNOW,
SHE COULD JUST HAVE BEEN

316
00:15:37,625 --> 00:15:40,333
COVERING HER BUTT
BECAUSE SHE MADE A MISTAKE.

317
00:15:40,375 --> 00:15:42,417
- NO.
ZHU LI DOESN'T MAKE MISTAKES.

318
00:15:42,458 --> 00:15:44,041
YOU GUYS LEAVE.

319
00:15:44,083 --> 00:15:45,792
IF WE MAKE IT OUT,
WE'LL GET TO THE CITY SOMEHOW.

320
00:15:45,834 --> 00:15:47,125
- BOLIN, NO!

321
00:15:53,333 --> 00:15:54,542
- YOU GUYS GET OUT OF HERE.

322
00:15:54,583 --> 00:15:57,333
I HAVE TO GO WITH BOLIN.

323
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,458
- COULD BE OUR BEST CHANCE
TO STOP KUVIRA.

324
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:03,250
- MAYBE TAKE OUT THAT WEAPON.

325
00:16:03,291 --> 00:16:05,041
- WE CAN'T LET OPAL BE
THE COOLEST.

326
00:16:05,083 --> 00:16:07,583
- IF YOU ALL WANT TO GET
YOURSELVES CAPTURED AGAIN

327
00:16:07,625 --> 00:16:09,709
OR WORSE,
THAT'S YOUR BUSINESS.

328
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:11,417
I'M THROUGH.

329
00:16:11,458 --> 00:16:14,041
- WATCH OUT FOR BAATAR SR.
AND HUAN.

330
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:19,291
- SO HOW HAVE YOU BEEN, MOTHER?

331
00:16:19,333 --> 00:16:21,583
- I TOLD YOU
NEVER TO CALL ME THAT.

332
00:16:39,041 --> 00:16:42,083
- SPIRITS, THIS IS THE AVATAR.

333
00:16:42,125 --> 00:16:44,166
PLEASE LISTEN TO ME.

334
00:16:44,208 --> 00:16:45,542
SINCE I OPENED THE PORTALS,

335
00:16:45,583 --> 00:16:47,959
SPIRITS AND HUMANS
HAVE LIVED HAPPILY TOGETHER

336
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,375
IN REPUBLIC CITY.

337
00:16:49,417 --> 00:16:51,792
IT'S ALL I COULD HAVE HOPED FOR.

338
00:16:51,834 --> 00:16:53,417
I KNOW YOU FELT THE EFFECTS

339
00:16:53,458 --> 00:16:55,583
OF KUVIRA CUTTING DOWN
SPIRIT VINES.

340
00:16:55,625 --> 00:16:58,333
BUT NOW ISN'T THE TIME
FOR YOU TO FLEE THE CITY.

341
00:16:58,375 --> 00:17:00,792
IT'S TIME FOR YOU TO HELP ME
SAVE IT FROM KUVIRA,

342
00:17:00,834 --> 00:17:03,166
WHO WAS PERVERTING SPIRIT POWER
TO USE AS A WEAPON

343
00:17:03,208 --> 00:17:05,458
AGAINST OTHER HUMANS.

344
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:08,667
- WE DON'T GET INVOLVED
WITH HUMAN WARS.

345
00:17:08,709 --> 00:17:10,333
- SPIRITS WORKED WITH UNALAQ.

346
00:17:10,375 --> 00:17:14,125
- HE WAS MISUSING VAATU'S POWER
DURING HARMONIC CONVERGENCE

347
00:17:14,166 --> 00:17:15,750
TO FORCE SPIRITS TO FIGHT YOU.

348
00:17:15,792 --> 00:17:18,166
IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT?

349
00:17:18,208 --> 00:17:20,709
- NO,
BUT AS THE AVATAR,

350
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:22,125
I'M HOPING THAT
YOU WILL COME TO MY AID

351
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:24,542
TO SAVE THE NEW WORLD
WE ALL SHARE.

352
00:17:24,583 --> 00:17:28,083
- WHAT YOU WANT IS
EXACTLY WHAT KUVIRA WANTS:

353
00:17:28,125 --> 00:17:31,500
TO USE SPIRITS AS A WEAPON
IN A HUMAN WAR.

354
00:17:31,542 --> 00:17:34,041
THE ANSWER IS NO.

355
00:17:34,083 --> 00:17:35,208
- WAIT!

356
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:36,458
PLEASE, LISTEN.

357
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:39,000
IF SPIRITS AND HUMANS
ARE GONNA LIVE TOGETHER,

358
00:17:39,041 --> 00:17:40,542
WE HAVE TO WORK WITH EACH OTHER.

359
00:17:40,583 --> 00:17:43,083
[sighs]

360
00:17:51,875 --> 00:17:54,959
[machinery slides into place]

361
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:05,709
- OPAL?

362
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:08,125
NO.
WE HAVE TO STOP THE TEST.

363
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:13,667
[all grunt]

364
00:18:21,041 --> 00:18:22,917
- [gasps]
- WHOA.

365
00:18:25,667 --> 00:18:27,917
[rocks clattering]

366
00:18:40,041 --> 00:18:41,000
- AAH!

367
00:18:52,542 --> 00:18:54,291
[all scream]

368
00:19:23,458 --> 00:19:25,667
- [grunts]

369
00:19:33,834 --> 00:19:36,375
- [grunting]

370
00:19:45,792 --> 00:19:46,959
[all shout]

371
00:20:08,583 --> 00:20:11,125
[rumbling]

372
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:15,166
[all shouting]

373
00:20:20,583 --> 00:20:23,208
[Juicy grunting]

374
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:27,041
- YOU GIVE METALBENDERS
A BAD NAME!

375
00:20:28,583 --> 00:20:30,542
[whoosh]

376
00:20:30,583 --> 00:20:33,333
[Juicy grumbling]

377
00:20:40,166 --> 00:20:42,125
- THANKS FOR COMING TO SAVE US,
MOM.

378
00:20:42,166 --> 00:20:44,375
- YEAH, THANKS, CHIEF.

379
00:20:44,417 --> 00:20:45,917
I'M SORRY
FOR WHAT I SAID LAST NIGHT.

380
00:20:45,959 --> 00:20:49,291
I WAS JUST...
YOU KNOW.

381
00:20:49,333 --> 00:20:52,417
- LOOK, I KNOW
I WASN'T A GREAT MOTHER,

382
00:20:52,458 --> 00:20:56,625
BUT ONE WAY OR ANOTHER,
I ENDED UP WITH TWO GREAT KIDS.

383
00:20:56,667 --> 00:21:00,417
GOOD ENOUGH TO RISK
MY BONY OLD BUTT FOR, ANYWAY.

384
00:21:00,458 --> 00:21:04,250
IF YOU CAN JUST FIND SOME WAY
NOT TO HATE ME,

385
00:21:04,291 --> 00:21:08,500
MAYBE THAT'S ENOUGH,
AT LEAST FOR ME.

386
00:21:08,542 --> 00:21:11,208
- ME TOO.

387
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:13,709
- YOU KNOW, I NEVER HAD
ANY FAMILY EXCEPT FOR MY BROTHER

388
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:15,709
UNTIL A FEW YEARS AGO,

389
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:18,625
AND REUNITING WITH THEM MADE ME
REALIZE HOW SPECIAL IT IS--

390
00:21:18,667 --> 00:21:20,542
- ARGH, ENOUGH.

391
00:21:20,583 --> 00:21:24,000
ENJOY THE RIDE BACK TO THE CITY
WITH THE GUM FLAPPER HERE.

392
00:21:24,041 --> 00:21:26,500
- AREN'T YOU COMING BACK TO
REPUBLIC CITY WITH US, GRANDMA?

393
00:21:26,542 --> 00:21:29,917
- NO, MY FIGHTING DAYS
ARE OVER.

394
00:21:29,959 --> 00:21:33,291
DON'T TELL KORRA,
BUT MY BACK IS KILLING ME NOW.

395
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:35,208
THIS IS WHY
YOU DIDN'T SEE KATARA

396
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:37,709
MESSING WITH
THAT CIVIL WAR NONSENSE.

397
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:42,458
AT SOME POINT,
YOU GOTTA LEAVE IT TO THE KIDS.

398
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:44,583
- I WANT TO THANK YOU
FOR COMING BACK TO SAVE ME.

399
00:21:44,625 --> 00:21:47,959
AND DON'T BE TOO HARD ON BOLIN
FOR WORKING WITH KUVIRA.

400
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,333
HIS HEART WAS
IN THE RIGHT PLACE.

401
00:21:49,375 --> 00:21:52,000
- I THINK
BOLIN HAS WORKED HIS WAY

402
00:21:52,041 --> 00:21:53,500
OUT OF THE POLAR BEAR-DOGHOUSE.

403
00:21:53,542 --> 00:21:54,709
MWAH.

404
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:57,000
- YES!
HA-HA!

405
00:21:57,041 --> 00:21:58,792
- WE SHOULD GET GOING.

406
00:21:58,834 --> 00:22:01,709
I'M AFRAID I HAVE BAD NEWS
TO DELIVER TO REPUBLIC CITY.

407
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:05,125
KUVIRA IS GOING TO ATTACK
IN TWO WEEKS.
