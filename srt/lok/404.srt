1
00:00:06,736 --> 00:00:07,736
Earth.

2
00:00:08,475 --> 00:00:09,491
Fire.

3
00:00:10,377 --> 00:00:11,377
Air.

4
00:00:12,145 --> 00:00:13,145
Water.

5
00:00:14,283 --> 00:00:17,940
Only the Avatar can master
all four elements

6
00:00:18,338 --> 00:00:20,412
and bring balance to the world.

7
00:00:26,108 --> 00:00:28,405
After Korra failed
to return to Republic city,

8
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:30,452
everyone's been worried
about her fate.

9
00:00:30,478 --> 00:00:34,432
So Tenzin tasked Jinora, Ikki, and
Meelo with finding the Avatar.

10
00:00:34,534 --> 00:00:37,787
Unbeknownst to the kids, Korra found
refuge in the swamp with Toph,

11
00:00:37,813 --> 00:00:40,506
who discovered there was still
metal poison in her body.

12
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:42,779
But when Toph tried removing it,
Korra resisted.

13
00:00:42,805 --> 00:00:46,246
Will the airbender kids find the
Avatar and help her return to action?

14
00:00:54,219 --> 00:00:56,890
Tenzin, are you sure
you can't go with them?

15
00:00:57,195 --> 00:01:01,000
Raiko asked me to stay here and help
figure out a diplomatic solution

16
00:01:01,026 --> 00:01:02,542
to this Kuvira problem.

17
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:04,716
Mom, we'll be fine.

18
00:01:04,997 --> 00:01:08,286
Grandpa Aang and his friends were around
our age when they traveled the world.

19
00:01:08,602 --> 00:01:11,971
Well, at least I won't have to worry
about you starving out there.

20
00:01:12,066 --> 00:01:13,922
Mom, we're going
to be in the wild,

21
00:01:14,141 --> 00:01:15,799
living off the land.

22
00:01:15,891 --> 00:01:18,018
We don't need your food.

23
00:01:19,997 --> 00:01:21,981
But I made your favorite treat.

24
00:01:22,139 --> 00:01:24,551
Sweet buns
with happy faces on them?

25
00:01:25,639 --> 00:01:29,300
Well, I guess we're not
officially on the road yet.

26
00:01:33,675 --> 00:01:35,800
Aw, this one is smudged.

27
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:37,499
I can't eat this.

28
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:41,184
You know, sometimes,
things get smudged in the wild.

29
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:50,657
Were you able to get
a read on Korra yet?

30
00:01:50,683 --> 00:01:54,845
No, but once we're further out, I'll be
able to hone in on her spiritual energy.

31
00:01:55,214 --> 00:01:57,518
We should be able to find her
within a few days.

32
00:01:58,233 --> 00:02:00,123
Good luck, and be careful.

33
00:02:00,149 --> 00:02:02,007
Remember, Jinora's in charge.

34
00:02:02,265 --> 00:02:03,831
I answer to no man

35
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:08,039
or girl,
even if she does have tattoos.

36
00:02:08,515 --> 00:02:09,515
Meelo.

37
00:02:09,677 --> 00:02:11,410
Now, let's move out, soldiers.

38
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:13,704
Pepper, yip yip.

39
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:35,401
Finally!

40
00:02:35,427 --> 00:02:37,573
I've been holding my pee
for an hour.

41
00:02:45,769 --> 00:02:48,037
If you get through to Korra,
tell her I said hi.

42
00:02:49,769 --> 00:02:50,839
Do you feel anything yet?

43
00:02:53,406 --> 00:02:54,625
What's taking so long?

44
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:58,242
Ikki, I can't concentrate
if you keep talking.

45
00:02:58,585 --> 00:03:00,465
Why don't you go play
with one of those spirits?

46
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:06,468
Jinora's spirity powers
are broken,

47
00:03:06,485 --> 00:03:07,911
and she doesn't know
where Korra is.

48
00:03:08,008 --> 00:03:10,101
My powers are not broken.

49
00:03:10,127 --> 00:03:12,213
I just need
more than two seconds

50
00:03:12,337 --> 00:03:13,605
and some quiet.

51
00:03:13,993 --> 00:03:15,895
While you try to pull
yourself together,

52
00:03:15,921 --> 00:03:19,588
Poki and I are going to go into town
and find out if anyone's seen Korra.

53
00:03:19,657 --> 00:03:21,063
Sounds like a good plan to me.

54
00:03:21,314 --> 00:03:22,486
Enough chitchat.

55
00:03:22,509 --> 00:03:24,694
You can hold
the picture of Korra I drew.

56
00:03:24,824 --> 00:03:25,824
Wow.

57
00:03:26,045 --> 00:03:27,270
I didn't know you could draw.

58
00:03:27,456 --> 00:03:30,150
You don't know a lot of things
about me, sister.

59
00:03:30,457 --> 00:03:31,547
Let's roll.

60
00:03:40,974 --> 00:03:42,417
Have you seen this woman?

61
00:03:42,555 --> 00:03:45,791
Well, aren't you
an adorable little thing?

62
00:03:45,868 --> 00:03:47,185
I'm not adorable.

63
00:03:47,211 --> 00:03:48,414
I'm dangerous.

64
00:03:48,974 --> 00:03:51,977
Dangerously cute
with those cheeks.

65
00:03:52,506 --> 00:03:53,990
Aww.

66
00:03:54,017 --> 00:03:55,784
This never happened.

67
00:03:56,079 --> 00:03:57,079
Let's split.

68
00:04:02,406 --> 00:04:03,410
The Avatar?

69
00:04:03,629 --> 00:04:05,135
We still have one of those?

70
00:04:05,472 --> 00:04:07,790
Haven't seen her, kid. Sorry.

71
00:04:09,189 --> 00:04:10,308
Man!

72
00:04:22,561 --> 00:04:25,045
- Can I trust you?
- I guess so.

73
00:04:25,709 --> 00:04:28,508
I'm on a top secret mission
to find the Avatar.

74
00:04:28,606 --> 00:04:29,619
Have you seen her?

75
00:04:29,718 --> 00:04:31,028
I haven't, sorry.

76
00:04:31,256 --> 00:04:32,769
Top secret mission, huh?

77
00:04:32,897 --> 00:04:36,286
Yeah, it's been pretty dangerous.

78
00:04:36,449 --> 00:04:38,603
I've seen some things.

79
00:04:38,845 --> 00:04:41,324
Really? What kind of things?

80
00:04:41,557 --> 00:04:43,991
Crazy things.

81
00:04:44,038 --> 00:04:44,770
Cool.

82
00:04:44,929 --> 00:04:49,343
I'm Meelo. What should I call
you, other than beautiful?

83
00:04:49,369 --> 00:04:51,452
I'm Tuyen. Nice to meet you.

84
00:04:51,533 --> 00:04:54,756
Ooh! Meelo found a girlfriend.

85
00:04:54,834 --> 00:04:56,050
Go away, Ikki!

86
00:04:56,719 --> 00:04:58,180
Jinora's been looking for you.

87
00:04:58,206 --> 00:04:59,004
We're moving on.

88
00:04:59,205 --> 00:05:01,161
Looks like you got to get back
to your mission.

89
00:05:01,975 --> 00:05:03,189
Good luck, Meelo.

90
00:05:10,907 --> 00:05:12,375
Thanks a lot, Ikki.

91
00:05:12,401 --> 00:05:14,883
You drove away
the love of my life!

92
00:05:21,243 --> 00:05:22,443
Jinora, Ikki!

93
00:05:22,578 --> 00:05:23,600
It's Korra!

94
00:05:23,777 --> 00:05:25,657
Where, where, where, where,
where, where, where?

95
00:05:27,488 --> 00:05:29,720
It's just a photo of Korra.

96
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:31,334
At least it's something.

97
00:05:31,449 --> 00:05:32,714
Pretty neat, huh?

98
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:35,732
She came by here
about six months ago.

99
00:05:36,102 --> 00:05:41,022
Looks like someone just drummed
up a good old-fashioned lead.

100
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:42,809
Then where did she go?

101
00:05:42,835 --> 00:05:46,153
Oh, I don't know, but she
wasn't looking too good.

102
00:05:47,149 --> 00:05:49,223
Ikki, this is all your fault.

103
00:05:49,347 --> 00:05:51,222
What? I didn't do anything.

104
00:05:51,488 --> 00:05:54,085
Exactly, you need to start
pulling your weight.

105
00:05:54,111 --> 00:05:57,447
That goes for you too,
so-called leader.

106
00:05:58,524 --> 00:06:01,631
Remember when he used to be
so nice and sweet?

107
00:06:01,802 --> 00:06:02,802
No.

108
00:06:06,117 --> 00:06:07,117
So...

109
00:06:07,603 --> 00:06:08,851
What's the plan for today?

110
00:06:08,943 --> 00:06:10,592
You're looking at it.

111
00:06:10,736 --> 00:06:13,641
But we didn't do anything
yesterday or the day before that.

112
00:06:17,156 --> 00:06:17,805
I know!

113
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:20,484
Tell me the story about how
you taught Aang to earthbend.

114
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:22,028
What's there to tell?

115
00:06:22,204 --> 00:06:26,413
I threw some rocks at the Avatar, he got
all whiny, and Sokka fell in a hole.

116
00:06:26,652 --> 00:06:28,579
I thought
there'd be more to it than that.

117
00:06:29,285 --> 00:06:32,808
What about the time you guys took down
the Firelord? That must have been epic.

118
00:06:33,029 --> 00:06:35,046
Oh, yeah.

119
00:06:35,208 --> 00:06:37,358
It was hot, I was on a blimp,

120
00:06:37,594 --> 00:06:39,599
and I think a giant turtle showed up.

121
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:41,240
Wow, what a day.

122
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:43,688
Okay, you're terrible
at telling stories.

123
00:06:43,943 --> 00:06:46,417
You're terrible
at listening to them.

124
00:06:51,166 --> 00:06:53,214
Quit making all that racket.

125
00:06:53,352 --> 00:06:55,055
If you're so antsy
to do something,

126
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:57,829
why don't you go and collect
some mushrooms for dinner?

127
00:06:57,984 --> 00:06:58,984
You got it.

128
00:06:59,695 --> 00:07:02,593
Take the path till you see
the boulder with a hole in it.

129
00:07:02,619 --> 00:07:03,813
Then go to your left.

130
00:07:03,856 --> 00:07:06,909
Oh, and make sure you get
the big, slimy ones.

131
00:07:07,522 --> 00:07:09,414
They're the tastiest.

132
00:07:13,998 --> 00:07:16,590
Hey, where's all the food
mom gave us?

133
00:07:17,049 --> 00:07:18,360
I threw it in the river.

134
00:07:18,386 --> 00:07:20,158
You did what?

135
00:07:20,453 --> 00:07:22,972
That food was
supposed to last us two weeks.

136
00:07:23,254 --> 00:07:24,961
Hey, keep it down!

137
00:07:25,122 --> 00:07:26,912
I'm trying to meditate.

138
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:29,441
Yeah, keep it down, Ikki.

139
00:07:29,467 --> 00:07:31,391
Meelo threw away all our food!

140
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:34,597
From now on,
we hunt for our meals.

141
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:36,682
Meelo, we're vegetarians.

142
00:07:37,055 --> 00:07:38,448
We don't hunt.

143
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:39,656
Enough whining.

144
00:07:39,811 --> 00:07:41,925
Poki and I will go
find some grub.

145
00:07:51,985 --> 00:07:53,398
My name's Meelo.

146
00:07:53,424 --> 00:07:57,120
I like to throw away food and
fart at inappropriate moments.

147
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:03,768
I'm Jinora. I'm so above it all
because I'm meditating all the time.

148
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:09,788
Oh, I'm sorry.

149
00:08:10,146 --> 00:08:11,369
I didn't see you there.

150
00:08:15,404 --> 00:08:16,173
Wait!

151
00:08:16,321 --> 00:08:17,859
You dropped your breakfast!

152
00:08:29,434 --> 00:08:30,434
Hey.

153
00:08:33,756 --> 00:08:35,121
Does this mean we're friends?

154
00:08:40,253 --> 00:08:43,127
You're trespassing.
Hold it right there.

155
00:08:58,118 --> 00:09:00,092
All right, little airbender.

156
00:09:00,347 --> 00:09:02,613
Tell us what you're doing
in the Earth Empire.

157
00:09:02,639 --> 00:09:04,012
Are you spying?

158
00:09:04,038 --> 00:09:06,651
No. I swear I'm not a spy.

159
00:09:06,677 --> 00:09:08,457
I've been traveling
with my brother and sister.

160
00:09:08,481 --> 00:09:11,376
It's our first big mission, and my
dad, Tenzin, is counting on us.

161
00:09:11,402 --> 00:09:14,916
But if we don't find the Avatar, he's
going to be really disappointed.

162
00:09:16,933 --> 00:09:18,807
Can I talk to you for a second?

163
00:09:21,582 --> 00:09:23,802
This girl is Tenzin's kid,

164
00:09:23,828 --> 00:09:25,437
and she's looking
for the Avatar.

165
00:09:25,463 --> 00:09:27,475
Do you know what that means?

166
00:09:27,694 --> 00:09:29,710
No, but try this macaroon.

167
00:09:31,534 --> 00:09:32,915
Get that out of my face!

168
00:09:33,275 --> 00:09:36,263
Look, if we capture
these three airbender kids

169
00:09:36,289 --> 00:09:37,775
and bring them to Kuvira,

170
00:09:38,248 --> 00:09:41,073
I bet we'd get
a big-time promotion.

171
00:09:41,099 --> 00:09:43,113
You mean
we'd get out of this dump?

172
00:09:45,769 --> 00:09:47,203
Sorry, little lady.

173
00:09:47,229 --> 00:09:49,639
It looks like we got off
on the wrong foot.

174
00:09:49,742 --> 00:09:52,277
So you're out here
with your brother and sister.

175
00:09:52,492 --> 00:09:53,884
Where's your campsite?

176
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:54,910
Why do you want to know?

177
00:09:55,115 --> 00:09:58,145
We just want to get
the family back together again.

178
00:09:58,171 --> 00:10:02,948
Maybe we could sit everybody down
and have a nice plate of macaroons.

179
00:10:03,202 --> 00:10:04,941
Where did you get those?

180
00:10:04,967 --> 00:10:07,620
I found a whole sack of food
down by the river,

181
00:10:07,653 --> 00:10:09,336
and with each delicious snack

182
00:10:09,362 --> 00:10:11,494
comes a lovely,
handwritten note.

183
00:10:11,878 --> 00:10:15,350
This one says,
"you're my handsome little man."

184
00:10:15,486 --> 00:10:17,228
That is so touching.

185
00:10:17,355 --> 00:10:20,616
My mom wrote those notes.
That's our sack of food!

186
00:10:20,848 --> 00:10:22,390
Enough with the cute notes!

187
00:10:22,632 --> 00:10:24,312
Where are your brother
and sister?

188
00:10:24,338 --> 00:10:25,897
Who cares?

189
00:10:26,189 --> 00:10:27,696
I don't want to see them.

190
00:10:28,122 --> 00:10:30,420
I'd rather hang out here
with you guys.

191
00:10:30,813 --> 00:10:32,379
Hit me with one
of those macaroons.

192
00:11:37,155 --> 00:11:38,353
Are you okay?

193
00:11:38,538 --> 00:11:40,323
Yup, totally fine.

194
00:11:40,813 --> 00:11:43,568
I hope you're hungry,
'cause we found some...

195
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:47,798
We found some berries.

196
00:11:56,733 --> 00:11:57,733
Ugh.

197
00:11:57,775 --> 00:11:59,847
Looks like you got
some bad berries.

198
00:11:59,873 --> 00:12:01,760
So much for living off the land.

199
00:12:02,165 --> 00:12:03,103
They're fine.

200
00:12:03,129 --> 00:12:06,010
I just ate too many of
them because they're so...

201
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:07,761
so delicious.

202
00:12:09,863 --> 00:12:12,945
Did you run into Ikki while you were
picking your poisonous berries?

203
00:12:13,043 --> 00:12:14,348
Uh, no.

204
00:12:14,374 --> 00:12:16,481
What, did she run off
or something?

205
00:12:16,646 --> 00:12:17,646
I think so.

206
00:12:17,764 --> 00:12:20,811
Great, now I got to go
find the Avatar and her.

207
00:12:20,837 --> 00:12:23,443
This mission is getting worse
by the day.

208
00:12:23,574 --> 00:12:25,793
This isn't only
your mission, Meelo.

209
00:12:25,819 --> 00:12:28,139
I thought we were doing this
as a family.

210
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:31,867
It seems pretty lonely out here.

211
00:12:32,128 --> 00:12:33,361
Where is everybody else?

212
00:12:33,551 --> 00:12:35,520
I don't want to talk about it.

213
00:12:35,655 --> 00:12:39,522
Aww, he's just upset because Kuvira's
taking all the troops to Zaofu,

214
00:12:39,548 --> 00:12:40,972
and we had to stay here.

215
00:12:41,376 --> 00:12:44,872
Well, it's the last city left, and
then the whole empire will be united.

216
00:12:44,898 --> 00:12:47,634
And you know there's gonna be
a huge party afterwards.

217
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:49,499
It's tough to be left out, huh?

218
00:12:49,832 --> 00:12:52,256
I know exactly
what you're going through.

219
00:12:52,417 --> 00:12:54,285
- You do?
- Yeah.

220
00:12:54,618 --> 00:12:58,199
My brother and sister are always
leaving me out of fun stuff.

221
00:12:58,381 --> 00:13:01,871
I mean, we're supposed to be
looking for the Avatar together,

222
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,821
but they won't even let me help.

223
00:13:03,847 --> 00:13:05,622
Well, that's not fair.

224
00:13:06,046 --> 00:13:07,657
Maybe we can help you out.

225
00:13:11,376 --> 00:13:13,613
So where have you
looked for her?

226
00:13:14,056 --> 00:13:15,689
We've been traveling
down the west coast,

227
00:13:15,715 --> 00:13:19,797
and the only lead we have is some guy
who said he saw her six months ago.

228
00:13:19,823 --> 00:13:22,128
Well, we have troops
pretty much everywhere.

229
00:13:22,154 --> 00:13:24,933
If anyone saw her,
they would have reported it.

230
00:13:25,625 --> 00:13:26,991
What about this place?

231
00:13:27,267 --> 00:13:28,514
Oh, that's the swamp.

232
00:13:28,807 --> 00:13:29,999
No one goes there.

233
00:13:30,025 --> 00:13:31,613
Don't get discouraged, Ikki.

234
00:13:31,948 --> 00:13:35,758
You're a valuable member of the
team, and you have a big heart.

235
00:13:36,126 --> 00:13:37,518
I know you're gonna find her.

236
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:39,558
Now, let's get you
out of those ropes.

237
00:13:47,132 --> 00:13:48,677
You're welcome, Ikki.

238
00:13:49,065 --> 00:13:50,327
Why did you do that?

239
00:13:50,555 --> 00:13:52,213
We're saving you. Let's go.

240
00:13:52,566 --> 00:13:54,216
I had everything under control.

241
00:13:54,421 --> 00:13:57,294
I just found our food, and I
have an idea where Korra is.

242
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:59,213
You do? Then let's get going.

243
00:13:59,471 --> 00:14:00,471
Hold on.

244
00:14:02,086 --> 00:14:04,045
Sorry my brother and sister
knocked you out.

245
00:14:04,242 --> 00:14:05,505
Nice chatting with you.

246
00:14:07,178 --> 00:14:08,987
Macaroon.

247
00:14:17,832 --> 00:14:18,937
There you are.

248
00:14:18,963 --> 00:14:20,285
You got my dinner yet?

249
00:14:20,311 --> 00:14:21,938
No, this swamp,

250
00:14:22,404 --> 00:14:24,555
it did crazy things to my mind.

251
00:14:25,083 --> 00:14:28,780
I had visions of all the
times my enemies hurt me.

252
00:14:28,806 --> 00:14:31,344
Yeah, I figured something
like that might happen.

253
00:14:31,432 --> 00:14:32,104
What?

254
00:14:32,222 --> 00:14:34,045
You wanted me
to see those visions?

255
00:14:34,477 --> 00:14:37,057
You are one twisted old lady,
you know that?

256
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:40,194
Look, I know you want
to get better,

257
00:14:40,405 --> 00:14:42,682
and so does the swamp.

258
00:14:42,821 --> 00:14:44,761
It can sense
you're out of balance.

259
00:14:45,022 --> 00:14:47,919
It'll teach you
what you need to learn,

260
00:14:48,215 --> 00:14:50,943
if you're open to listening.

261
00:14:52,647 --> 00:14:54,881
Okay, swamp. I'm all ears.

262
00:14:55,166 --> 00:14:57,763
You said you saw
your past enemies.

263
00:14:58,029 --> 00:14:59,980
Now, why do you think that is?

264
00:15:00,110 --> 00:15:01,110
I don't know,

265
00:15:01,491 --> 00:15:04,330
because they've made me and a
lot of other people suffer.

266
00:15:04,796 --> 00:15:07,861
Sounds like you're carrying
around your former enemies,

267
00:15:07,886 --> 00:15:11,530
the same way you're still carrying
around that metal poison.

268
00:15:11,844 --> 00:15:15,665
You ever consider maybe you
could learn something from them?

269
00:15:16,446 --> 00:15:18,935
Sounds like the swamp's
messing with your mind too.

270
00:15:18,961 --> 00:15:21,884
My mind is just fine, thank you.

271
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:25,814
Listen, what did Amon want?

272
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:27,893
Equality for all.

273
00:15:28,189 --> 00:15:31,290
Unalaq?
He brought back the spirits.

274
00:15:31,495 --> 00:15:34,064
And Zaheer believed in freedom.

275
00:15:34,978 --> 00:15:35,978
I guess.

276
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:40,061
The problem was, those guys
were totally out of balance,

277
00:15:40,087 --> 00:15:42,541
and they took their ideologies too far.

278
00:15:42,617 --> 00:15:43,892
Okay, fine.

279
00:15:44,323 --> 00:15:46,733
But that doesn't explain
why they keep haunting me.

280
00:15:46,916 --> 00:15:49,427
Because you need to face
your fears.

281
00:15:49,970 --> 00:15:52,778
You can't expect to deal
with future enemies

282
00:15:52,779 --> 00:15:55,450
if you're still fighting
the old ones.

283
00:15:56,306 --> 00:15:58,660
Maybe you're right, but how
am I supposed to move on?

284
00:15:58,897 --> 00:16:01,831
Boy, you avatars sure need
a lot of hand-holding.

285
00:16:02,006 --> 00:16:02,571
Get up.

286
00:16:02,939 --> 00:16:05,264
We're going
to the Banyangrove tree.

287
00:16:12,128 --> 00:16:14,251
Those soldiers said
there weren't any troops here,

288
00:16:14,277 --> 00:16:16,548
and I figure
if Korra's not feeling good,

289
00:16:16,582 --> 00:16:19,566
she might come to a spiritual
place like this to get better.

290
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:33,881
There is an enormous amount of spiritual
activity here, but I don't feel Korra.

291
00:16:33,983 --> 00:16:36,843
Well, that's what we get
for listening to Ikki.

292
00:16:36,869 --> 00:16:40,463
Guys, we just got here.
Let's at least look around.

293
00:16:40,664 --> 00:16:43,560
I'm sorry, Ikki,
but I'm with Meelo on this.

294
00:16:43,828 --> 00:16:45,654
I don't think
we're going to find her here.

295
00:16:46,164 --> 00:16:47,397
Let's go, pepper.

296
00:16:51,313 --> 00:16:53,261
Aah!

297
00:17:12,454 --> 00:17:15,113
Why did those stupid vines
pull us in here anyway?

298
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:16,608
Because they want us here.

299
00:17:16,756 --> 00:17:19,095
I'm telling you,
Korra's got to be close.

300
00:17:19,357 --> 00:17:22,502
I don't know, Ikki.
I still don't sense Korra.

301
00:17:22,612 --> 00:17:26,781
Well, you haven't sensed her the entire
time we've been looking for her.

302
00:17:26,944 --> 00:17:30,249
Next time I go on a mission,
it's going to be boys only,

303
00:17:30,275 --> 00:17:32,542
just Poki and me.

304
00:17:41,559 --> 00:17:42,877
It's beautiful.

305
00:17:43,517 --> 00:17:48,452
The roots of the Banyangrove tree spread
out for miles in every direction,

306
00:17:48,616 --> 00:17:50,890
connecting this whole swamp.

307
00:17:51,165 --> 00:17:55,078
Your problem is you've been
disconnected for too long,

308
00:17:55,646 --> 00:17:58,490
disconnected from the people
who love you

309
00:17:58,643 --> 00:18:01,839
and disconnected from yourself.

310
00:18:21,229 --> 00:18:23,361
I'm tired of listening to you!

311
00:18:23,699 --> 00:18:26,587
Korra. I know where Korra is!

312
00:18:26,893 --> 00:18:28,048
Yeah!

313
00:18:28,733 --> 00:18:29,905
I can't believe it!

314
00:18:30,191 --> 00:18:32,851
I saw Jinora, Ikki, and Meelo.
They're here!

315
00:18:33,133 --> 00:18:33,783
Good.

316
00:18:33,809 --> 00:18:35,928
Hopefully, they're here
to take you home.

317
00:18:41,128 --> 00:18:42,505
Korra!

318
00:18:58,113 --> 00:19:00,536
Oh, we missed you so much, Korra.

319
00:19:00,562 --> 00:19:02,141
I missed you so much too.

320
00:19:02,678 --> 00:19:04,671
How did you find me
all the way out here?

321
00:19:05,097 --> 00:19:06,651
Jinora sensed your energy.

322
00:19:06,677 --> 00:19:09,184
But we never would've been
here if it weren't for Ikki.

323
00:19:09,458 --> 00:19:12,747
I never would've stormed off and found
those soldiers if it weren't for Meelo.

324
00:19:12,941 --> 00:19:15,208
I was trying
to toughen up these ladies,

325
00:19:15,234 --> 00:19:17,812
but I guess
it was a team effort.

326
00:19:18,183 --> 00:19:19,457
I love your hair.

327
00:19:19,803 --> 00:19:21,893
It's so you.

328
00:19:24,357 --> 00:19:25,722
I-I'm so sorry.

329
00:19:25,748 --> 00:19:28,124
This is Meelo, Jinora, and Ikki,

330
00:19:28,150 --> 00:19:29,928
Aang and Katara's grandchildren.

331
00:19:30,188 --> 00:19:33,260
Your grandpa was
a real pain in my butt.

332
00:19:33,447 --> 00:19:38,825
Wait a minute,
cranky, old, blind...

333
00:19:38,964 --> 00:19:40,494
You must be Toph!

334
00:19:40,629 --> 00:19:42,718
Oh, I like this one.

335
00:19:43,335 --> 00:19:44,954
You need to come home, Korra.

336
00:19:45,247 --> 00:19:47,508
Kuvira is taking over
the Earth kingdom.

337
00:19:47,534 --> 00:19:48,888
You have to stop her.

338
00:19:49,179 --> 00:19:50,207
I don't know.

339
00:19:51,137 --> 00:19:52,932
I'm not the Avatar I used to be.

340
00:19:52,958 --> 00:19:55,206
I can't even go into the Avatar state.

341
00:19:55,442 --> 00:19:56,593
Please, Korra.

342
00:19:57,058 --> 00:19:58,807
The world needs you back.

343
00:20:07,306 --> 00:20:09,348
All right, I'm ready.

344
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:11,285
I'm not bending it out of you.

345
00:20:11,526 --> 00:20:13,323
You got to do this on your own.

346
00:20:22,228 --> 00:20:23,724
Close your eyes.

347
00:20:24,411 --> 00:20:26,262
Clear your mind.

348
00:20:26,588 --> 00:20:28,462
And don't freak out
like last time.

349
00:20:28,958 --> 00:20:31,482
Now, focus your energy.

350
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:34,206
Find the metal.

351
00:20:34,368 --> 00:20:37,794
Let it move through your body.

352
00:20:50,374 --> 00:20:52,657
That fight is over.

353
00:20:53,014 --> 00:20:54,983
Release the fear.

354
00:21:27,889 --> 00:21:30,044
Well done, Korra.

355
00:21:34,658 --> 00:21:37,413
The Avatar is back in business!

356
00:21:42,219 --> 00:21:43,987
I feel so much lighter.

357
00:21:44,266 --> 00:21:46,381
Thank you so much
for helping me.

358
00:21:46,923 --> 00:21:49,867
I'd like to give you a hug now
if that's okay with you.

359
00:21:49,893 --> 00:21:52,864
All right. You earned it.

360
00:22:01,050 --> 00:22:02,650
- Bye, Toph!
- Bye, see you later.

361
00:22:02,683 --> 00:22:04,724
- It was so nice to meet you!
- We're gonna miss you!

362
00:22:04,748 --> 00:22:07,074
Finally, some peace and quiet.
