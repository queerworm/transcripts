1
00:00:07,667 --> 00:00:09,291
- EARTH.

2
00:00:09,333 --> 00:00:11,125
FIRE.

3
00:00:11,166 --> 00:00:12,875
AIR.

4
00:00:12,917 --> 00:00:15,083
WATER.

5
00:00:15,125 --> 00:00:18,875
ONLY THE AVATAR CAN MASTER
ALL FOUR ELEMENTS

6
00:00:18,917 --> 00:00:22,083
AND BRING BALANCE
TO THE WORLD.

7
00:00:26,625 --> 00:00:28,875
- AFTER KORRA FAILED
TO RETURN TO REPUBLIC CITY,

8
00:00:28,917 --> 00:00:31,083
EVERYONE'S BEEN WORRIED
ABOUT HER FATE.

9
00:00:31,125 --> 00:00:33,542
SO TENZIN TASKED
JINORA, IKKI, AND MEELO

10
00:00:33,583 --> 00:00:35,083
WITH FINDING THE AVATAR.

11
00:00:35,125 --> 00:00:36,458
UNBEKNOWNST TO THE KIDS,

12
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:38,834
KORRA FOUND REFUGE
IN THE SWAMP WITH TOPH,

13
00:00:38,875 --> 00:00:41,291
WHO DISCOVERED THERE WAS STILL
METAL POISON IN HER BODY.

14
00:00:41,333 --> 00:00:43,834
BUT WHEN TOPH TRIED REMOVING IT,
KORRA RESISTED.

15
00:00:43,875 --> 00:00:45,208
WILL THE AIRBENDER KIDS
FIND THE AVATAR

16
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:46,834
AND HELP HER RETURN
TO ACTION?

17
00:00:55,166 --> 00:00:58,000
- TENZIN, ARE YOU SURE
YOU CAN'T GO WITH THEM?
- MEELO!

18
00:00:58,041 --> 00:00:59,458
- RAIKO ASKED ME TO STAY HERE

19
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:01,750
AND HELP FIGURE OUT
A DIPLOMATIC SOLUTION

20
00:01:01,792 --> 00:01:03,375
TO THIS KUVIRA PROBLEM.

21
00:01:03,417 --> 00:01:05,709
- MOM, WE'LL BE FINE.

22
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:07,542
GRANDPA AANG AND HIS FRIENDS
WERE AROUND OUR AGE

23
00:01:07,583 --> 00:01:08,834
WHEN THEY TRAVELED
THE WORLD.

24
00:01:08,875 --> 00:01:10,750
- WELL, AT LEAST
I WON'T HAVE TO WORRY

25
00:01:10,792 --> 00:01:12,959
ABOUT YOU STARVING
OUT THERE.

26
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,959
- MOM, WE'RE GOING
TO BE IN THE WILD,

27
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,500
LIVING OFF THE LAND.

28
00:01:16,542 --> 00:01:19,250
WE DON'T NEED YOUR FOOD.

29
00:01:19,291 --> 00:01:20,750
[Poki chirps]

30
00:01:20,792 --> 00:01:22,959
- BUT I MADE
YOUR FAVORITE TREAT.

31
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,208
- SWEET BUNS
WITH HAPPY FACES ON THEM?

32
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:30,208
WELL, I GUESS WE'RE NOT
OFFICIALLY ON THE ROAD YET.

33
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:31,667
[Poki coos]

34
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:36,542
AW, THIS ONE IS SMUDGED.

35
00:01:36,583 --> 00:01:38,583
I CAN'T EAT THIS.

36
00:01:38,625 --> 00:01:42,250
- YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES,
THINGS GET SMUDGED IN THE WILD.

37
00:01:49,041 --> 00:01:51,417
- WERE YOU ABLE TO GET
A READ ON KORRA YET?

38
00:01:51,458 --> 00:01:53,250
- NO, BUT ONCE
WE'RE FURTHER OUT,

39
00:01:53,291 --> 00:01:56,000
I'LL BE ABLE TO HONE IN
ON HER SPIRITUAL ENERGY.

40
00:01:56,041 --> 00:01:58,667
WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO FIND HER
WITHIN A FEW DAYS.

41
00:01:58,709 --> 00:02:00,750
- GOOD LUCK,
AND BE CAREFUL.

42
00:02:00,792 --> 00:02:03,041
REMEMBER,
JINORA'S IN CHARGE.

43
00:02:03,083 --> 00:02:04,917
- I ANSWER TO NO MAN

44
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:09,250
OR GIRL,
EVEN IF SHE DOES HAVE TATTOOS.

45
00:02:09,291 --> 00:02:10,625
- MEELO.

46
00:02:10,667 --> 00:02:12,041
- NOW, LET'S MOVE OUT,
SOLDIERS.

47
00:02:12,083 --> 00:02:13,291
- [sighs]

48
00:02:13,333 --> 00:02:14,583
- PEPPER, YIP YIP.

00:02:14,625 --> 00:02:16,792
[Pepper groaning]

50
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,041
- FINALLY!

51
00:02:36,083 --> 00:02:39,041
I'VE BEEN HOLDING MY PEE
FOR AN HOUR.

52
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:50,542
- IF YOU GET THROUGH TO KORRA,
TELL HER I SAID HI.

53
00:02:50,583 --> 00:02:51,792
DO YOU FEEL ANYTHING YET?

54
00:02:51,834 --> 00:02:53,792
- [groans]

55
00:02:53,834 --> 00:02:55,458
- WHAT'S TAKING SO LONG?

56
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:59,083
- IKKI, I CAN'T CONCENTRATE
IF YOU KEEP TALKING.

57
00:02:59,125 --> 00:03:01,208
WHY DON'T YOU GO PLAY
WITH ONE OF THOSE SPIRITS?

58
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:03,834
- [sighs]

59
00:03:05,667 --> 00:03:06,959
JINORA'S SPIRITY POWERS
ARE BROKEN,

60
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,667
AND SHE DOESN'T KNOW
WHERE KORRA IS.

61
00:03:08,709 --> 00:03:10,834
- MY POWERS ARE NOT BROKEN.

62
00:03:10,875 --> 00:03:13,166
I JUST NEED
MORE THAN TWO SECONDS

63
00:03:13,208 --> 00:03:14,750
AND SOME QUIET.

64
00:03:14,792 --> 00:03:16,959
- WHILE YOU TRY
TO PULL YOURSELF TOGETHER,

65
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,333
POKI AND I ARE
GOING TO GO INTO TOWN

66
00:03:18,375 --> 00:03:20,583
AND FIND OUT
IF ANYONE'S SEEN KORRA.

67
00:03:20,625 --> 00:03:21,792
- SOUNDS LIKE
A GOOD PLAN TO ME.

68
00:03:21,834 --> 00:03:23,083
- ENOUGH CHITCHAT.

69
00:03:23,125 --> 00:03:25,291
YOU CAN HOLD
THE PICTURE OF KORRA I DREW.

70
00:03:25,333 --> 00:03:26,750
- WOW.

71
00:03:26,792 --> 00:03:28,291
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU COULD DRAW.

72
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:31,250
- YOU DON'T KNOW A LOT OF THINGS
ABOUT ME, SISTER.

73
00:03:31,291 --> 00:03:33,667
LET'S ROLL.

74
00:03:41,834 --> 00:03:43,166
HAVE YOU SEEN THIS WOMAN?

75
00:03:43,208 --> 00:03:46,583
- WELL, AREN'T YOU
AN ADORABLE LITTLE THING?

76
00:03:46,625 --> 00:03:48,208
- I'M NOT ADORABLE.

77
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:49,959
I'M DANGEROUS.

78
00:03:50,041 --> 00:03:53,208
- DANGEROUSLY CUTE
WITH THOSE CHEEKS.

79
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:54,667
- AWW.

80
00:03:54,709 --> 00:03:56,709
- THIS NEVER HAPPENED.

81
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:59,000
LET'S SPLIT.

82
00:04:03,375 --> 00:04:04,500
- THE AVATAR?

83
00:04:04,542 --> 00:04:06,083
WE STILL HAVE ONE OF THOSE?

84
00:04:06,125 --> 00:04:08,667
HAVEN'T SEEN HER, KID.
SORRY.

85
00:04:08,709 --> 00:04:11,500
- [groans]
MAN!

86
00:04:23,166 --> 00:04:26,291
CAN I TRUST YOU?
- I GUESS SO.

87
00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:29,583
- I'M ON A TOP SECRET MISSION
TO FIND THE AVATAR.

88
00:04:29,625 --> 00:04:30,667
HAVE YOU SEEN HER?

89
00:04:30,709 --> 00:04:32,208
- I HAVEN'T, SORRY.

90
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:33,917
TOP SECRET MISSION, HUH?

91
00:04:33,959 --> 00:04:37,375
- YEAH, IT'S BEEN
PRETTY DANGEROUS.

92
00:04:37,417 --> 00:04:39,959
I'VE SEEN SOME THINGS.

93
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,458
- REALLY?
WHAT KIND OF THINGS?

94
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:45,000
- CRAZY THINGS.

95
00:04:45,041 --> 00:04:45,750
- COOL.

96
00:04:45,792 --> 00:04:47,208
- I'M MEELO.

97
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:50,041
WHAT SHOULD I CALL YOU,
OTHER THAN BEAUTIFUL?

98
00:04:50,083 --> 00:04:52,291
- I'M TUYEN.
NICE TO MEET YOU.

99
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:55,583
- OOH!
MEELO FOUND A GIRLFRIEND.

100
00:04:55,625 --> 00:04:57,166
- GO AWAY, IKKI!

101
00:04:57,208 --> 00:04:58,542
- JINORA'S BEEN LOOKING
FOR YOU.

102
00:04:58,583 --> 00:05:00,250
WE'RE MOVING ON.

103
00:05:00,291 --> 00:05:02,750
- LOOKS LIKE YOU GOT TO GET BACK
TO YOUR MISSION.

104
00:05:02,792 --> 00:05:05,625
GOOD LUCK, MEELO.

105
00:05:11,792 --> 00:05:13,208
- THANKS A LOT, IKKI.

106
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:17,041
YOU DROVE AWAY
THE LOVE OF MY LIFE!

107
00:05:22,375 --> 00:05:23,542
JINORA, IKKI!

108
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:25,166
IT'S KORRA!

109
00:05:25,208 --> 00:05:28,333
- WHERE, WHERE, WHERE, WHERE,
WHERE, WHERE, WHERE?

110
00:05:28,375 --> 00:05:30,875
- IT'S JUST A PHOTO
OF KORRA.

111
00:05:30,917 --> 00:05:32,625
- AT LEAST IT'S SOMETHING.

112
00:05:32,667 --> 00:05:33,917
- PRETTY NEAT, HUH?

113
00:05:33,959 --> 00:05:36,875
SHE CAME BY HERE
ABOUT SIX MONTHS AGO.

114
00:05:36,917 --> 00:05:39,542
- LOOKS LIKE
SOMEONE JUST DRUMMED UP

115
00:05:39,583 --> 00:05:41,792
A GOOD OLD-FASHIONED LEAD.

116
00:05:41,834 --> 00:05:43,625
THEN WHERE DID SHE GO?

117
00:05:43,667 --> 00:05:45,041
- OH, I DON'T KNOW,

118
00:05:45,083 --> 00:05:47,959
BUT SHE WASN'T LOOKING
TOO GOOD.

119
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,250
- IKKI, THIS IS
ALL YOUR FAULT.

120
00:05:50,291 --> 00:05:52,417
- WHAT?
I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.

121
00:05:52,458 --> 00:05:55,166
- EXACTLY, YOU NEED TO START
PULLING YOUR WEIGHT.

122
00:05:55,208 --> 00:05:59,417
THAT GOES FOR YOU TOO,
SO-CALLED LEADER.

123
00:05:59,458 --> 00:06:02,583
- REMEMBER WHEN HE USED TO BE
SO NICE AND SWEET?

124
00:06:02,625 --> 00:06:04,792
- NO.

125
00:06:06,709 --> 00:06:08,458
- [whistling]
- SO...

126
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:09,959
WHAT'S THE PLAN
FOR TODAY?

127
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,500
- YOU'RE LOOKING AT IT.

128
00:06:11,542 --> 00:06:13,542
- BUT WE DIDN'T DO ANYTHING
YESTERDAY

129
00:06:13,583 --> 00:06:15,792
OR THE DAY BEFORE THAT.

130
00:06:17,667 --> 00:06:19,166
I KNOW!

131
00:06:19,208 --> 00:06:21,709
TELL ME THE STORY ABOUT HOW
YOU TAUGHT AANG TO EARTHBEND.

132
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:23,166
- WHAT'S THERE TO TELL?

133
00:06:23,208 --> 00:06:24,709
I THREW SOME ROCKS
AT THE AVATAR,

134
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:27,500
HE GOT ALL WHINY,
AND SOKKA FELL IN A HOLE.

135
00:06:27,542 --> 00:06:29,709
- I THOUGHT
THERE'D BE MORE TO IT THAN THAT.

136
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:32,792
WHAT ABOUT THE TIME YOU GUYS
TOOK DOWN THE FIRELORD?

137
00:06:32,834 --> 00:06:33,542
THAT MUST HAVE BEEN EPIC.

138
00:06:33,583 --> 00:06:36,208
- OH, YEAH.

139
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:38,417
IT WAS HOT,
I WAS ON A BLIMP,

140
00:06:38,458 --> 00:06:40,625
AND I THINK
A GIANT TURTLE SHOWED UP.

141
00:06:40,667 --> 00:06:42,417
WOW, WHAT A DAY.

142
00:06:42,458 --> 00:06:44,583
- OKAY, YOU'RE TERRIBLE
AT TELLING STORIES.

143
00:06:44,625 --> 00:06:48,583
- YOU'RE TERRIBLE
AT LISTENING TO THEM.

144
00:06:48,625 --> 00:06:49,667
- [sighs]

145
00:06:49,709 --> 00:06:52,208
[tapping foot]

146
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:54,208
- QUIT MAKING
ALL THAT RACKET.

147
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:56,000
IF YOU'RE SO ANTSY
TO DO SOMETHING,

148
00:06:56,041 --> 00:06:58,792
WHY DON'T YOU GO AND COLLECT
SOME MUSHROOMS FOR DINNER?

149
00:06:58,834 --> 00:07:00,709
- YOU GOT IT.

150
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:03,333
- TAKE THE PATH TILL YOU SEE
THE BOULDER WITH A HOLE IN IT.

151
00:07:03,375 --> 00:07:04,875
THEN GO TO YOUR LEFT.

152
00:07:04,917 --> 00:07:07,792
OH, AND MAKE SURE YOU GET
THE BIG, SLIMY ONES.

153
00:07:07,834 --> 00:07:11,041
[chuckles]
THEY'RE THE TASTIEST.

154
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,959
- HEY, WHERE'S ALL THE FOOD
MOM GAVE US?

155
00:07:18,041 --> 00:07:19,792
- I THREW IT IN THE RIVER.

156
00:07:19,834 --> 00:07:21,500
- YOU DID WHAT?

157
00:07:21,542 --> 00:07:24,250
THAT FOOD WAS
SUPPOSED TO LAST US TWO WEEKS.

158
00:07:24,291 --> 00:07:26,166
- HEY, KEEP IT DOWN!

159
00:07:26,208 --> 00:07:28,083
I'M TRYING TO MEDITATE.

160
00:07:28,125 --> 00:07:30,625
- YEAH, KEEP IT DOWN, IKKI.

161
00:07:30,667 --> 00:07:32,417
- MEELO THREW AWAY
ALL OUR FOOD!

162
00:07:32,458 --> 00:07:35,959
- FROM NOW ON,
WE HUNT FOR OUR MEALS.

163
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,083
- MEELO, WE'RE VEGETARIANS.

164
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:39,834
WE DON'T HUNT.

165
00:07:39,875 --> 00:07:41,125
- ENOUGH WHINING.

166
00:07:41,166 --> 00:07:44,583
POKI AND I WILL GO
FIND SOME GRUB.

167
00:07:44,625 --> 00:07:47,625
- [screams]

168
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,333
MY NAME'S MEELO.

169
00:07:54,375 --> 00:07:55,709
I LIKE TO THROW AWAY FOOD

170
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:58,125
AND FART
AT INAPPROPRIATE MOMENTS.

171
00:07:58,166 --> 00:07:59,834
I'M JINORA.

172
00:07:59,875 --> 00:08:01,250
I'M SO ABOVE IT ALL

173
00:08:01,291 --> 00:08:05,083
BECAUSE I'M MEDITATING
ALL THE TIME.

174
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:09,000
- [squeaking]

175
00:08:09,041 --> 00:08:11,166

00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:03,125
- BOY, YOU AVATARS SURE NEED
A LOT OF HAND-HOLDING.

351
00:16:03,166 --> 00:16:04,458
GET UP.

352
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:07,834
WE'RE GOING
TO THE BANYANGROVE TREE.

353
00:16:10,375 --> 00:16:13,083
[Pepper groans]

354
00:16:13,125 --> 00:16:15,709
- THOSE SOLDIERS SAID
THERE WEREN'T ANY TROOPS HERE,

355
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:17,959
AND I FIGURE
IF KORRA'S NOT FEELING GOOD,

356
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,750
SHE MIGHT COME TO A SPIRITUAL
PLACE LIKE THIS TO GET BETTER.

357
00:16:20,792 --> 00:16:22,959
[Pepper groans]

358
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:33,875
- THERE IS AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT
OF SPIRITUAL ACTIVITY HERE,

359
00:16:33,917 --> 00:16:35,583
BUT I DON'T FEEL KORRA.

360
00:16:35,625 --> 00:16:37,959
- WELL, THAT'S WHAT WE GET
FOR LISTENING TO IKKI.

361
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,750
- GUYS, WE JUST GOT HERE.
LET'S AT LEAST LOOK AROUND.

362
00:16:41,792 --> 00:16:45,000
- I'M SORRY, IKKI,
BUT I'M WITH MEELO ON THIS.

363
00:16:45,041 --> 00:16:46,959
I DON'T THINK
WE'RE GOING TO FIND HER HERE.

364
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,125
LET'S GO, PEPPER.

365
00:16:49,166 --> 00:16:50,458
[Pepper groans]

366
00:16:51,458 --> 00:16:54,500
[Pepper grunts]
all: AAH!

367
00:16:57,834 --> 00:17:00,625
[all scream]

368
00:17:00,667 --> 00:17:02,500
[all grunt]

369
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:09,583
- [grunts]

370
00:17:09,625 --> 00:17:13,208
[Pepper grunts]

371
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:15,834
- WHY DID THOSE STUPID VINES
PULL US IN HERE ANYWAY?

372
00:17:15,875 --> 00:17:17,750
- BECAUSE THEY WANT US HERE.

373
00:17:17,792 --> 00:17:20,250
I'M TELLING YOU,
KORRA'S GOT TO BE CLOSE.

374
00:17:20,291 --> 00:17:23,500
- I DON'T KNOW, IKKI.
I STILL DON'T SENSE KORRA.

375
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:25,333
- WELL, YOU HAVEN'T SENSED HER

376
00:17:25,375 --> 00:17:27,709
THE ENTIRE TIME
WE'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR HER.

377
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:31,125
- NEXT TIME I GO ON A MISSION,
IT'S GOING TO BE BOYS ONLY,

378
00:17:31,166 --> 00:17:33,333
JUST POKI AND ME.

379
00:17:33,375 --> 00:17:34,083
- [groans]

380
00:17:41,458 --> 00:17:43,959
- IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

381
00:17:44,041 --> 00:17:46,375
- THE ROOTS
OF THE BANYANGROVE TREE

382
00:17:46,417 --> 00:17:49,542
SPREAD OUT FOR MILES
IN EVERY DIRECTION,

383
00:17:49,583 --> 00:17:51,834
CONNECTING THIS WHOLE SWAMP.

384
00:17:51,875 --> 00:17:56,250
YOUR PROBLEM IS YOU'VE BEEN
DISCONNECTED FOR TOO LONG,

385
00:17:56,291 --> 00:17:59,583
DISCONNECTED FROM THE PEOPLE
WHO LOVE YOU

386
00:17:59,625 --> 00:18:02,959
AND DISCONNECTED
FROM YOURSELF.

387
00:18:21,959 --> 00:18:24,291
- I'M TIRED
OF LISTENING TO YOU!

388
00:18:24,333 --> 00:18:27,458
- KORRA.
I KNOW WHERE KORRA IS!

389
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:29,667
both: YEAH!

390
00:18:29,709 --> 00:18:31,291
- I CAN'T BELIEVE IT!

391
00:18:31,333 --> 00:18:33,375
I SAW JINORA, IKKI, AND MEELO.
THEY'RE HERE!

392
00:18:33,417 --> 00:18:35,083
- GOOD.

393
00:18:35,125 --> 00:18:37,250
HOPEFULLY, THEY'RE HERE
TO TAKE YOU HOME.

394
00:18:38,583 --> 00:18:41,667
[Pepper groans]

395
00:18:41,709 --> 00:18:43,959
all: KORRA!

396
00:18:59,041 --> 00:19:01,291
- OH, WE MISSED YOU SO MUCH,
KORRA.

397
00:19:01,333 --> 00:19:03,458
- I MISSED YOU SO MUCH TOO.

398
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:05,959
HOW DID YOU FIND ME
ALL THE WAY OUT HERE?

399
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,959
- JINORA SENSED YOUR ENERGY.

400
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,458
- BUT WE NEVER WOULD'VE BEEN
HERE IF IT WEREN'T FOR IKKI.

401
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:12,667
- I NEVER WOULD'VE STORMED OFF
AND FOUND THOSE SOLDIERS

402
00:19:12,709 --> 00:19:14,125
IF IT WEREN'T FOR MEELO.

403
00:19:14,166 --> 00:19:16,041
- I WAS TRYING
TO TOUGHEN UP THESE LADIES,

404
00:19:16,083 --> 00:19:18,709
BUT I GUESS
IT WAS A TEAM EFFORT.

405
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:20,458
- I LOVE YOUR HAIR.

406
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:22,792
- IT'S SO YOU.

407
00:19:22,834 --> 00:19:25,000
- [clears throat]

408
00:19:25,041 --> 00:19:26,250
- I-I'M SO SORRY.

409
00:19:26,291 --> 00:19:28,959
THIS IS MEELO, JINORA, AND IKKI,

410
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,208
AANG AND KATARA'S GRANDCHILDREN.

411
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:34,250
- YOUR GRANDPA WAS
A REAL PAIN IN MY BUTT.

412
00:19:34,291 --> 00:19:39,667
- WAIT A MINUTE,
CRANKY, OLD, BLIND...

413
00:19:39,709 --> 00:19:41,750
YOU MUST BE TOPH!

414
00:19:41,792 --> 00:19:43,959
- OH, I LIKE THIS ONE.

415
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,291
- YOU NEED TO COME HOME, KORRA.

416
00:19:46,333 --> 00:19:48,125
KUVIRA IS TAKING OVER
THE EARTH KINGDOM.

417
00:19:48,166 --> 00:19:49,792
- YOU HAVE TO STOP HER.

418
00:19:49,834 --> 00:19:53,709
- I DON'T KNOW.
I'M NOT THE AVATAR I USED TO BE.

419
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:56,291
I CAN'T EVEN
GO INTO THE AVATAR STATE.

420
00:19:56,333 --> 00:19:58,000
- PLEASE, KORRA.

421
00:19:58,041 --> 00:20:00,959
- THE WORLD NEEDS YOU BACK.

422
00:20:07,792 --> 00:20:10,125
- ALL RIGHT, I'M READY.

423
00:20:10,166 --> 00:20:12,041
- I'M NOT BENDING IT OUT OF YOU.

424
00:20:12,083 --> 00:20:14,750
YOU GOT TO DO THIS
ON YOUR OWN.

425
00:20:18,792 --> 00:20:23,125
- [breathes deeply]

426
00:20:23,166 --> 00:20:25,542
- CLOSE YOUR EYES.

427
00:20:25,583 --> 00:20:27,542
CLEAR YOUR MIND.

428
00:20:27,583 --> 00:20:29,667
AND DON'T FREAK OUT
LIKE LAST TIME.

429
00:20:29,709 --> 00:20:33,333
NOW, FOCUS YOUR ENERGY.

430
00:20:33,375 --> 00:20:35,083
FIND THE METAL.

431
00:20:35,125 --> 00:20:38,792
LET IT MOVE
THROUGH YOUR BODY.

432
00:20:48,417 --> 00:20:51,083
- [panting]

433
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:53,667
- THAT FIGHT IS OVER.

434
00:20:53,709 --> 00:20:55,667
RELEASE THE FEAR.

435
00:20:55,709 --> 00:20:57,250
- [sighs]
[grunts]

436
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,458
[exhales]

437
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:10,083
[grunts]

438
00:21:10,125 --> 00:21:12,291
[exhales]

439
00:21:28,709 --> 00:21:30,959
- WELL DONE, KORRA.

440
00:21:35,375 --> 00:21:39,083
- THE AVATAR IS
BACK IN BUSINESS!

441
00:21:43,083 --> 00:21:45,208
- I FEEL SO MUCH LIGHTER.

442
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:47,667
THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR HELPING ME.

443
00:21:47,709 --> 00:21:50,291
I'D LIKE TO GIVE YOU A HUG NOW
IF THAT'S OKAY WITH YOU.

444
00:21:50,333 --> 00:21:53,291
- ALL RIGHT.
YOU EARNED IT.

445
00:22:01,125 --> 00:22:03,125
- BYE, TOPH!
- BYE, SEE YOU LATER.

446
00:22:03,166 --> 00:22:05,125
- IT WAS SO NICE TO MEET YOU!
- WE'RE GONNA MISS YOU!

447
00:22:05,166 --> 00:22:08,959
- FINALLY,
SOME PEACE AND QUIET.
