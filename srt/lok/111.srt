- I WILL.

179
00:11:51,417 --> 00:11:53,417
GOOD LUCK.

180
00:11:53,458 --> 00:11:55,000
IF YOU'RE GOING
INTO THE MOUNTAINS,

181
00:11:55,041 --> 00:11:57,250
YOU SHOULD BRING NAGA.

182
00:11:57,291 --> 00:11:58,542
- [grunts]
- TAKE GOOD CARE OF BOLIN

183
00:11:58,583 --> 00:12:00,417
FOR ME.

184
00:12:01,834 --> 00:12:03,917
- ASAMI.

185
00:12:03,959 --> 00:12:06,834
I'M SORRY THINGS GOT
SO MESSED UP BETWEEN US.

186
00:12:06,875 --> 00:12:09,208
BUT WHATEVER HAPPENS TODAY,
I WANT YOU TO KNOW

187
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:11,500
HOW MUCH
I CARE ABOUT YOU.

188
00:12:11,542 --> 00:12:13,417
- I CARE ABOUT YOU TOO.

189
00:12:29,834 --> 00:12:34,333
- GOOD FORTUNE AND SUCCESS
TO YOU, VALIANT HEROES.

190
00:12:57,875 --> 00:12:59,333
- THERE'S AMON!

191
00:13:01,041 --> 00:13:02,750
- WE NEED TO GET
INTO THE TEMPLE.

192
00:13:02,792 --> 00:13:04,834
THEN, WHEN HE RETURNS...

193
00:13:04,875 --> 00:13:06,000
- WE AMBUSH HIM.

194
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:14,542
- WHAT ARE YOU
TWO DOING HERE?

195
00:13:14,583 --> 00:13:16,625
- UH,
WE WERE JUST TRANSFERRED.

196
00:13:16,667 --> 00:13:18,792
- WELL, YOU'RE GETTING
TRANSFERRED AGAIN.

197
00:13:18,834 --> 00:13:21,709
AMON WANTS EXTRA SECURITY
AT THE ARENA TODAY.

198
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:24,917
- THE ARENA? FOR WHAT?
- THE RALLY.

199
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:27,417
YOU SHOULD HAVE
BEEN BRIEFED ABOUT THIS.

200
00:13:27,458 --> 00:13:29,208
- WE'LL BE THERE, SIR!

201
00:13:30,291 --> 00:13:33,166
I KNOW ANOTHER WAY IN.

202
00:13:43,333 --> 00:13:45,208
LET'S HIDE IN THE ATTIC.

203
00:13:49,041 --> 00:13:51,792
- UH, WE'RE NOT ALONE UP HERE.

204
00:13:53,959 --> 00:13:56,750
- TARRLOK?

205
00:13:56,792 --> 00:13:59,583
- I DON'T SUPPOSE
YOU'RE HERE TO RESCUE ME?

206
00:13:59,625 --> 00:14:02,583
- WE HAD NO IDEA
YOU WERE HERE.

207
00:14:02,625 --> 00:14:04,291
ARE THERE OTHER PRISONERS
ON THE ISLAND?

208
00:14:04,333 --> 00:14:06,834
- NO, I'M THE ONLY ONE.

209
00:14:06,875 --> 00:14:10,291
- AND WHAT MAKES YOU
SO SPECIAL?

210
00:14:10,333 --> 00:14:12,166
- I'M AMON'S BROTHER.

211
00:14:12,208 --> 00:14:13,458
both: [gasp]

212
00:14:21,625 --> 00:14:23,875
- AMON IS FROM
THE NORTHERN WATER TRIBE.

213
00:14:23,917 --> 00:14:27,458
HE IS A WATERBENDER AND
A BLOODBENDER, JUST LIKE I WAS.

214
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:29,333
- WHAT?!

215
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:30,834
- DID YOU KNOW
THIS ALL ALONG?

216
00:14:30,875 --> 00:14:34,458
- NO, NOT UNTIL
AFTER HE CAPTURED ME.

217
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:37,458
- HOW DID YOUR BROTHER
END UP BECOMING AMON?

218
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:41,583
- IT ALL BEGAN
WITH MY FATHER, YAKONE...

219
00:14:41,625 --> 00:14:43,250
WITH THE HELP
OF HIS FORMER GANG,

220
00:14:43,291 --> 00:14:45,792
HE ESCAPED PRISON
AND UNDERWENT SURGERY

221
00:14:45,834 --> 00:14:48,917
TO CHANGE HIS APPEARANCE.

222
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:51,208
HE ASSUMED A NEW IDENTITY
AND SETTLED DOWN

223
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:54,041
IN THE NORTHERN WATER TRIBE.

224
00:14:54,083 --> 00:14:58,375
THAT'S WHERE HE MET MY MOTHER.
A WARM, CARING WOMAN.

225
00:15:02,667 --> 00:15:05,417
BEFORE LONG, THEY STARTED
A FAMILY TOGETHER.

226
00:15:05,458 --> 00:15:06,959
- [laughs]

227
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,875
- AMON WAS THE FIRSTBORN,
UNDER THE NAME NOATAK.

228
00:15:09,917 --> 00:15:13,000
I WAS BORN
THREE YEARS LATER...

229
00:15:13,041 --> 00:15:17,667
NOATAK WAS A GOOD-NATURED KID,
ALWAYS LOOKING OUT FOR ME.

230
00:15:17,709 --> 00:15:20,583
THOSE WERE THE GOOD YEARS,
BEFORE MY BROTHER AND I

231
00:15:20,625 --> 00:15:23,667
DISCOVERED WE WERE WATERBENDERS.

232
00:15:23,709 --> 00:15:26,625
AT FIRST WE WERE EXCITED
BY OUR NEW ABILITIES,

233
00:15:26,667 --> 00:15:29,625
BUT OUR TRAINING BROUGHT OUT
A DIFFERENT SIDE OF MY FATHER.

234
00:15:29,667 --> 00:15:32,083
- TARRLOK,
YOU BETTER SHAPE UP

235
00:15:32,125 --> 00:15:34,208
OR YOU'LL BE OUT HERE
IN THE COLD ALL NIGHT

236
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:35,500
UNTIL YOU GET IT RIGHT.

237
00:15:35,542 --> 00:15:37,875
- I'M TRYING, BUT--
- TRY HARDER!

238
00:15:37,917 --> 00:15:40,000
YOUR BROTHER
WAS NEVER THIS SLOPPY.

239
00:15:40,041 --> 00:15:43,709
- DAD, HE'LL GET IT.
HE JUST NEEDS TIME.

240
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:47,000
- DON'T TALK BACK TO ME, SON.
EVER!

241
00:15:47,041 --> 00:15:49,458
- EVEN BACK THEN,
MY BROTHER WANTED EVERYONE

242
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:52,875
TO BE TREATED
FAIRLY AND EQUALLY.

243
00:15:52,917 --> 00:15:55,667
WHEN I WAS SEVEN,
MY FATHER TOOK ME AND NOATAK

244
00:15:55,709 --> 00:15:59,166
ON A HUNTING TRIP,
FAR AWAY FROM OUR HOME.

245
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:03,125
HE TOLD US HIS TRUE IDENTITY
WAS YAKONE,

246
00:16:03,166 --> 00:16:06,375
REPUBLIC CITY'S
MOST NOTORIOUS CRIME BOSS.

247
00:16:06,417 --> 00:16:10,208
AND THAT HE WAS ONCE
A BLOODBENDER OF RARE SKILL.

248
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:12,542
- WHAT'S BLOODBENDING?

249
00:16:12,583 --> 00:16:17,500
- THE MOST POWERFUL AND FEARED
FORM OF BENDING IN THE WORLD.

250
00:16:17,542 --> 00:16:21,875
IT WAS DECLARED ILLEGAL,
THANKS TO THAT COWARD KATARA.

251
00:16:21,917 --> 00:16:25,875
OUR FAMILY HAS THE STRONGEST
LINE OF BLOODBENDERS IN HISTORY.

252
00:16:25,917 --> 00:16:28,333
YOU BOYS HAVE THIS POWER
INSIDE OF YOU.

253
00:16:28,375 --> 00:16:31,375
AND I WILL TEACH YOU
TO MASTER IT.

254
00:16:31,417 --> 00:16:33,834
- WHAT HAPPENED
TO YOUR BENDING, DAD?

255
00:16:33,875 --> 00:16:37,417
- THE AVATAR
STOLE IT FROM ME.

256
00:16:37,458 --> 00:16:41,125
THAT'S WHY I BROUGHT YOU
OUT HERE--TO LEARN YOUR DESTINY.

257
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:44,792
YOU TWO WILL BECOME BLOODBENDERS
OF THE HIGHEST ORDER.

258
00:16:44,834 --> 00:16:48,333
WHEN THE TIME IS RIGHT,
YOU WILL CLAIM REPUBLIC CITY--

259
00:16:48,375 --> 00:16:50,834
AND YOU WILL
DESTROY THE AVATAR.

260
00:16:50,875 --> 00:16:53,125
YOU MUST AVENGE ME.

261
00:16:53,166 --> 00:16:56,166
THAT IS YOUR PURPOSE IN LIFE.

262
00:16:56,208 --> 00:16:59,208
- THE GOOD DAYS
WERE BEHIND US.

263
00:17:01,542 --> 00:17:03,792
EVERY FULL MOON,
OUR FATHER TOOK US ON

264
00:17:03,834 --> 00:17:07,166
ANOTHER SUPPOSED "HUNTING" TRIP,
WHERE HE SECRETLY TRAINED US

265
00:17:07,208 --> 00:17:09,291
IN BLOODBENDING.

266
00:17:09,333 --> 00:17:12,208
WE KEPT THE TRUTH
FROM OUR MOTHER.

267
00:17:16,583 --> 00:17:19,583
[animal groans]

268
00:17:19,625 --> 00:17:20,542
[groaning]

269
00:17:20,583 --> 00:17:22,291
- STOP! YOU'RE HURTING IT!

270
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:24,291
- TOUGHEN UP, TARRLOK.

271
00:17:24,333 --> 00:17:27,000
YOU'LL NEED
A THICKER SKIN FOR THIS.

272
00:17:27,041 --> 00:17:29,709
[animal groans]

273
00:17:32,417 --> 00:17:35,208
VERY GOOD, SON.
VERY GOOD.

274
00:17:39,041 --> 00:17:41,000
- A FEW YEARS LATER,
MY FATHER TAUGHT US

275
00:17:41,041 --> 00:17:42,417
TO BLOODBEND ANYTIME,

276
00:17:42,458 --> 00:17:44,959
WITHOUT THE NEED
OF THE FULL MOON.

277
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,208
WE PRACTICED CONSTANTLY,

278
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:51,125
AND I HATED
EVERY MINUTE OF IT.

279
00:17:51,166 --> 00:17:54,417
[growling, barking]

280
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:59,583
[whining]

281
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:07,375
I HAD NO STOMACH FOR
MANIPULATING HELPLESS ANIMALS.

282
00:18:07,417 --> 00:18:11,709
MY BROTHER, HOWEVER, SEEMED
TO REVEL IN HIS NEWFOUND POWER.

283
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:13,583
- [inhales]

284
00:18:14,834 --> 00:18:16,583
[whining]

285
00:18:16,625 --> 00:18:19,166
- HE WAS A PRODIGY,
MASTERING MY FATHER'S

286
00:18:19,208 --> 00:18:22,417
PSYCHIC BLOODBENDING TECHNIQUE
BY THE TIME HE WAS 14.

287
00:18:22,458 --> 00:18:25,291
[whining]

288
00:18:29,166 --> 00:18:31,458
- [gasps]

289
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:42,417
- THAT'S THE WAY IT'S DONE.

290
00:18:42,458 --> 00:18:46,709
THAT'S WHAT YOU NEED
TO STRIVE FOR.

291
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:48,875
- EVEN THOUGH NOATAK
WAS MY FATHER'S FAVORITE,

292
00:18:48,917 --> 00:18:51,542
IT WASN'T ANY EASIER
FOR HIM.

293
00:18:51,583 --> 00:18:53,667
HE CARRIED THE BURDEN
OF ALL YAKONE'S

294
00:18:53,709 --> 00:18:56,333
EXPECTATIONS AND DEMANDS.

295
00:18:59,166 --> 00:19:02,375
SOMETHING CHANGED
IN NOATAK OVER THE YEARS.

296
00:19:02,417 --> 00:19:07,041
THE LOVING BROTHER I ONCE KNEW
BECAME COLD AND DETACHED.

297
00:19:07,083 --> 00:19:10,291
[thunder rumbling]

298
00:19:10,333 --> 00:19:12,625
OUR FATHER PUSHED US
TO EXTREMES.

299
00:19:12,667 --> 00:19:16,417
AND ONE DAY, HE MADE US
BLOODBEND EACH OTHER.

300
00:19:17,875 --> 00:19:19,750
- NOATAK, GO.

301
00:19:19,792 --> 00:19:22,208
- [inhales]

302
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:25,875
- [groans]

303
00:19:27,792 --> 00:19:32,417
[screams]

304
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:37,625
- EXCELLENT.

305
00:19:39,333 --> 00:19:43,542
- UHH!
[panting]

306
00:19:43,583 --> 00:19:44,792
- TARRLOK!

307
00:19:44,834 --> 00:19:46,000
YOUR TURN.

308
00:19:46,041 --> 00:19:48,709
- NO, I WON'T DO IT.

309
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:50,875
- BLOODBEND YOUR BROTHER,
TARRLOK!

310
00:19:50,917 --> 00:19:52,625
- THAT FELT AWFUL!

311
00:19:52,667 --> 00:19:54,375
I DON'T WANT
TO DO THAT TO ANYONE!

312
00:19:54,417 --> 00:19:56,625
I NEVER WANT TO
BLOODBEND AGAIN!

313
00:19:56,667 --> 00:20:00,667
- YOU'RE A DISGRACE,
A WEAKLING.

314
00:20:00,709 --> 00:20:03,166
I'LL TEACH YOU A LESSON,
YOU INSUBORDINATE--

315
00:20:03,208 --> 00:20:05,834
UNH!

316
00:20:05,875 --> 00:20:11,500
- STAY AWAY FROM HIM.
- HOW DARE YOU BLOODBEND ME!

317
00:20:11,542 --> 00:20:13,375
- WHAT ARE YOU GOING
TO DO ABOUT IT?

318
00:20:13,417 --> 00:20:14,959
YOU'RE THE WEAK ONE.

319
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,917
- UNH! AAH!

320
00:20:17,959 --> 00:20:20,208
- YOU ALWAYS SAY BLOODBENDING
IS THE MOST POWERFUL THING

321
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:25,125
IN THE WORLD, BUT IT ISN'T--
THE AVATAR IS.

322
00:20:25,166 --> 00:20:27,208
HE TOOK YOUR BENDING AWAY.

323
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:29,166
WHAT COULD BE MORE
POWERFUL THAN THAT?

324
00:20:29,208 --> 00:20:32,917
- I MADE YOU WHAT YOU ARE!

325
00:20:32,959 --> 00:20:34,917
YOU'RE MINE!

326
00:20:34,959 --> 00:20:39,083
- WE'RE YOUR SONS,
NOT YOUR TOOLS OF REVENGE!

327
00:20:39,125 --> 00:20:40,583
LET'S GO.

328
00:20:40,625 --> 00:20:43,000
WE CAN RUN AWAY
FROM HIM, FOREVER.

329
00:20:43,041 --> 00:20:45,375
- RUN AWAY?
BUT WHAT ABOUT MOM?

330
00:20:45,417 --> 00:20:47,333
WE CAN'T JUST LEAVE HER.

331
00:20:47,375 --> 00:20:52,208
- HE WAS RIGHT ABOUT YOU.
YOU ARE A WEAKLING.

332
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:56,208
HUNH!
- AAH!

333
00:20:58,458 --> 00:21:01,041
- NOATAK! DON'T LEAVE, PLEASE!

334
00:21:01,083 --> 00:21:03,291
NOATAK!

335
00:21:09,166 --> 00:21:11,417
MY FATHER AND I SEARCHED
FOR DAYS,

336
00:21:11,458 --> 00:21:13,709
BUT WE NEVER FOUND
A SIGN OF NOATAK.

337
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:16,834
WE THOUGHT HE PERISHED
IN THAT STORM.

338
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:20,792
MY MOTHER WAS NEVER THE SAME
AFTER THE LOSS OF MY BROTHER.

339
00:21:23,375 --> 00:21:25,208
MY FATHER STOPPED TRAINING ME.

340
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:29,375
WITH NOATAK GONE,
HIS HOPES FOR REVENGE WITHERED,

341
00:21:29,417 --> 00:21:32,792
AND HE PASSED AWAY
A FEW YEARS LATER.

342
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:42,625
- THAT'S ONE OF THE SADDEST
STORIES I'VE EVER HEARD.

343
00:21:42,667 --> 00:21:45,333
- AVATAR KORRA,
I AM TRULY SORRY

344
00:21:45,375 --> 00:21:47,125
FOR ALL THAT
I DID TO YOU.

345
00:21:47,166 --> 00:21:49,333
I THOUGHT I WAS BETTER
THAN MY FATHER,

346
00:21:49,375 --> 00:21:51,792
BUT HIS GHOST
STILL SHAPED ME.

347
00:21:51,834 --> 00:21:53,959
I BECAME A SOLDIER
OF REVENGE,

348
00:21:54,041 --> 00:21:56,333
JUST LIKE HE WANTED ME
TO BE.

349
00:21:56,375 --> 00:21:59,125
AND SO DID MY BROTHER.

350
00:21:59,166 --> 00:22:02,375
THE REVOLUTION
MAY BE BUILT ON A LIE,

351
00:22:02,417 --> 00:22:06,000
BUT I THINK AMON TRULY BELIEVES
BENDING IS THE SOURCE

352
00:22:06,041 --> 00:22:08,583
OF ALL EVIL IN THE WORLD.

353
00:22:08,625 --> 00:22:10,458
- HOW DID YOU FIGURE OUT
AMON IS YOUR BROTHER?

354
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:12,583
- WHEN HE TOOK MY BENDING,

355
00:22:12,625 --> 00:22:15,709
THE SENSATION
WAS SOMEHOW FAMILIAR.

356
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:19,500
I LATER RECOGNIZED IT AS MY
BROTHER'S BLOODBENDING GRIP.

357
00:22:19,542 --> 00:22:22,125
- SO HE SOMEHOW
USES BLOODBENDING

358
00:22:22,166 --> 00:22:23,959
TO TAKE PEOPLE'S BENDING?

359
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,834
- I DON'T KNOW HOW
HE DOES IT, BUT THEN AGAIN,

360
00:22:26,875 --> 00:22:29,792
I'VE NEVER ENCOUNTERED A BENDER
AS STRONG AS NOATAK.

361
00:22:29,834 --> 00:22:31,709
- HOW IN THE WORLD
DO WE BEAT HIM?

362
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:33,583
- WE CAN'T.

363
00:22:33,625 --> 00:22:36,917
ANY ATTACK WE THROW AT HIM
HE'LL REDIRECT WITH HIS MIND.

364
00:22:36,959 --> 00:22:39,041
THAT'S HOW HE'S BEEN ABLE
TO CHALLENGE ANY BENDER.

365
00:22:39,083 --> 00:22:43,333
- SO MUCH FOR OUR AMBUSH.
IF WE STAY HERE, WE'RE TOAST.

366
00:22:43,375 --> 00:22:44,542
BUT THERE'S ANOTHER WAY
TO BEAT HIM.

367
00:22:44,583 --> 00:22:45,792
- HOW?

368
00:22:45,834 --> 00:22:47,583
- THIS WHOLE TIME,
AMON HAS BEEN

369
00:22:47,625 --> 00:22:49,333
ONE STEP AHEAD OF US.

370
00:22:49,375 --> 00:22:52,000
BUT FINALLY WE HAVE
THE ADVANTAGE--

371
00:22:52,041 --> 00:22:53,333
WE KNOW THE TRUTH ABOUT HIM.

372
00:22:53,375 --> 00:22:55,166
IF WE EXPOSE HIM
AS A BENDER

373
00:22:55,208 --> 00:22:56,750
IN FRONT OF ALL
HIS SUPPORTERS...

374
00:22:56,792 --> 00:22:58,041
- AT THE RALLY...

375
00:22:58,083 --> 00:23:00,041
- WE COULD TAKE AWAY
HIS TRUE POWER.

376
00:23:00,083 --> 00:23:04,000
AND UNDERMINE
THIS WHOLE REVOLUTION!

377
00:23:04,041 --> 00:23:05,291
- THANK YOU FOR YOUR HELP.

378
00:23:09,333 --> 00:23:10,792
WE CAN'T JUST
LEAVE HIM HERE.

379
00:23:10,834 --> 00:23:14,667
- GO. AMON CAN'T KNOW
ANYONE SPOKE WITH ME.

380
00:23:14,709 --> 00:23:18,792
DEFEAT HIM.
PUT AN END TO THIS SAD STORY.
