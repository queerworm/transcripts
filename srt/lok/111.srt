178

180

<i>but our training</i>
<i>brought out a different side of my father.</i>

181
00:15:16,138 --> 00:15:18,678
Tarrlok, you better shape up,

182
00:15:18,766 --> 00:15:22,136
or you'll be out here in the cold
all night, until you get it right.

- Try harder.

00:15:30,486 --> 00:15:33,236
Don't talk back to me, son. Ever.

TARRLOK: Even back then,

188
00:15:35,115 --> 00:15:38,155
<i>my brother wanted everyone</i>
<i>to be treated fairly and equally.</i>

189
00:15:39,161 --> 00:15:43,581

<i>took me and Noatak on a hunting trip,</i>

191

<i>Republic City's</i>
<i>most notorious crime boss,</i>

193

<i>a Bloodbender of rare skill.</i>

194
00:15:56,804 --> 00:15:59,184
What's bloodbending?

195
00:15:59,181 --> 00:16:03,851
The most powerful and feared form
of bending in the world.

196
00:16:03,936 --> 00:16:08,106
It was declared illegal,
thanks to that coward, Katara.

197
00:16:08,190 --> 00:16:12,280
Our family has the strongest line
of Bloodbenders in history.

What happened to your bending, Dad?

200
00:16:20,494 --> 00:16:23,664
The Avatar stole it from me.

201
00:16:23,747 --> 00:16:27,787
That's why I brought you out here,
to learn your destiny.

202
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:31,210
You two will become
Bloodbenders of the highest order.

203
00:16:31,213 --> 00:16:34,973
When the time is right,
you will claim Republic City,

204
00:16:35,050 --> 00:16:37,220
and you will destroy the Avatar.

205
00:16:37,594 --> 00:16:39,684

I am truly sorry for all that I did to you.

274
00:21:33,682 --> 00:21:38,522
I thought I was better than my father,
but his ghost still shaped me.

275
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:42,360
I became a soldier of revenge,
just like he wanted me to be.

276
00:21:42,691 --> 00:21:45,071
And so did my brother.

277
00:21:45,652 --> 00:21:48,902
The revolution may be built on a lie,

278
00:21:48,989 --> 00:21:54,739
but I think Amon truly believes bending
is the source of all evil in the world.

279
00:21:54,828 --> 00:21:57,198
How did you figure out
Amon is your brother?

280
00:21:57,289 --> 00:22:02,039
When he took my bending,
the sensation was somehow familiar.

281
00:22:02,127 --> 00:22:05,417
I later recognized it as
my brother's bloodbending grip.

282
00:22:06,256 --> 00:22:10,546
So he somehow uses bloodbending
to take people's bending?

283
00:22:10,635 --> 00:22:12,795
I don't know how he does it,

284
00:22:12,888 --> 00:22:16,468
but then again, I've never encountered
a bender as strong as Noatak.

285
00:22:16,558 --> 00:22:19,558
- How in the world do we beat him?
- We can't.

286
00:22:20,103 --> 00:22:23,273
Any attack we throw at him,
he'll redirect with his mind.

287
00:22:23,356 --> 00:22:25,436
That's how he's been able
to challenge any bender.

288
00:22:25,525 --> 00:22:28,775
So much for our ambush.
If we stay here, we're toast.

289
00:22:29,613 --> 00:22:31,993
- But there's another way to beat him.
- How?

290
00:22:32,073 --> 00:22:35,663
This whole time,
Amon has been one step ahead of us.

291
00:22:35,827 --> 00:22:39,657
But finally we have the advantage.
We know the truth about him.

292
00:22:39,748 --> 00:22:43,578
If we expose him as a bender
in front of all his supporters...

293
00:22:43,585 --> 00:22:44,585
At the rally.

294
00:22:44,586 --> 00:22:46,586
We could take away his true power.

295
00:22:46,588 --> 00:22:48,588
And undermine this whole revolution.

296
00:22:50,008 --> 00:22:51,628
Thank you for your help.

297
00:22:55,847 --> 00:22:58,097
- We can't just leave him here.
- TARRLOK: Go.

298
00:22:58,225 --> 00:23:00,975
Amon can't know anyone spoke with me.

299
00:23:01,061 --> 00:23:04,771
Defeat him. Put an end to this sad story.
