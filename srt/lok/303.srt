00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:39,583
NO.
KAI WOULDN'T--

172
00:09:39,625 --> 00:09:42,125
AW, MAN!

173
00:09:42,166 --> 00:09:44,125
- ALL RIGHT,
BEAT IT, YOU TWO,

174
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:46,834
BEFORE THINGS GET UGLY.
- AH, HEY!

175
00:09:56,875 --> 00:10:00,250
THE BAD NEWS IS,
WE'RE STUCK HERE.

176
00:10:00,291 --> 00:10:02,291
THE GOOD NEWS IS,
YOU CAN GO THE BATHROOM

177
00:10:02,333 --> 00:10:04,250
WHEREVER YOU WANT.

178
00:10:14,458 --> 00:10:16,291
- ARE YOU SURE WE SHOULDN'T HAVE
BROUGHT MORE PEOPLE

179
00:10:16,333 --> 00:10:17,959
TO COLLECT THE TAX MONEY?

180
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,709
- THERE ARE ROYAL GUARDS
WAITING AT THE VAULT.

181
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:21,542
I DOUBT ANYTHING WILL HAPPEN.

182
00:10:21,583 --> 00:10:24,083
I THINK HER MAJESTY JUST LIKES
ORDERING ME AROUND.

183
00:10:26,875 --> 00:10:29,041
- [groans]

184
00:10:29,083 --> 00:10:31,500
[yawns] MAN.

185
00:10:31,542 --> 00:10:34,083
OH, I THINK I SLIPPED A DISC
SLEEPING HERE.

186
00:10:34,125 --> 00:10:37,875
IT'S BEEN A WHILE SINCE WE
SPENT THE NIGHT ON A TRASH PILE.

187
00:10:37,917 --> 00:10:40,000
IT'S ABOUT HOW I REMEMBERED.

188
00:10:40,041 --> 00:10:42,792
- I BET EVERYONE'S FREAKING OUT
THAT WE'VE BEEN GONE ALL NIGHT.

189
00:10:42,834 --> 00:10:44,875
- I'M WORRIED ABOUT KAI.

190
00:10:44,917 --> 00:10:47,750
HE'S JUST A LITTLE KID
OUT THERE ON HIS OWN.

191
00:10:47,792 --> 00:10:50,041
HE'S PROBABLY REALLY SCARED.

192
00:10:55,959 --> 00:10:58,875
- YOUR BREAKFAST,
MASTER FUNG.

193
00:10:58,917 --> 00:11:02,500
- KEEP THE CHANGE.

194
00:11:02,542 --> 00:11:05,625
I LOVE BA SING SE.

195
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,250
- WHEW, I'M GETTING HUNGRY.

196
00:11:12,291 --> 00:11:15,083
[gasps] WE MIGHT HAVE TO
HUSTLE UP A LITTLE BREAKFAST

197
00:11:15,125 --> 00:11:18,291
WITH THE OLD FRUIT STAND SCAM.

198
00:11:18,333 --> 00:11:21,208
COME ON.

199
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:23,000
YOU REMEMBER HOW IT GOES.

200
00:11:23,041 --> 00:11:27,333
I PUSH YOU INTO THE STAND,
YOU SCREAM, I PRETEND TO FAINT.

201
00:11:27,375 --> 00:11:30,333
- I DON'T WANT ANY PART OF THIS.
BESIDES, LOOK AT THIS FRUIT.

202
00:11:30,375 --> 00:11:33,792
IT'S DISGUSTING.
WE DON'T WANT TO STEAL THIS.

203
00:11:33,834 --> 00:11:36,792
- HEY, YOU TRYING
TO STEAL MY FRUIT?

204
00:11:36,834 --> 00:11:40,000
- NO, I JUST SAID I DON'T WANT
ANY OF THIS ROTTEN FRUIT.

205
00:11:40,041 --> 00:11:42,458
- OH, YOU TOO GOOD
FOR MY FRUIT?

206
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:44,417
THIS IS THE BEST FRUIT
ON THE BLOCK.

207
00:11:44,458 --> 00:11:47,583
- SO YOU WANT ME TO STEAL IT?

208
00:11:47,625 --> 00:11:52,041
- JUST TRY IT, BUDDY.
[smooch] GO AHEAD.

209
00:11:52,083 --> 00:11:53,500
- I'M CONFUSED.

210
00:11:53,542 --> 00:11:55,500
ARE WE STEALING THE FRUIT
OR NOT?

211
00:11:55,542 --> 00:11:58,333
- I KNEW IT, THIEVES!

212
00:11:58,375 --> 00:11:59,500
[yells]

213
00:11:59,542 --> 00:12:00,959
[grunts]

214
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,291
- WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

215
00:12:03,333 --> 00:12:06,083
- DAD, THESE FRUIT THIEVES
ARE INSULTING OUR FRUIT.

216
00:12:09,291 --> 00:12:11,458
- BOLIN? MAKO?

217
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:14,542
- HOW DO YOU KNOW OUR NAMES?
- YEAH, I MEAN,

218
00:12:14,583 --> 00:12:18,208
I'M FAMOUS, SO I GET THAT,
BUT HOW DO YOU KNOW HIS NAME?

219
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:20,792
- YOU LOOK JUST LIKE SAN.

220
00:12:20,834 --> 00:12:24,291
TU, YOU'LL NEVER BELIEVE
WHO THESE GUYS ARE.

221
00:12:24,333 --> 00:12:26,792
THEY'RE YOUR COUSINS,
MY BROTHER SAN'S KIDS.

222
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:33,834
[dragon screeches]

223
00:12:38,125 --> 00:12:41,375
- LORD ZUKO, UNCLE.

224
00:12:41,417 --> 00:12:43,208
THIS IS A SURPRISE.

225
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:46,458
- FINALLY SOMETHING INTERESTING
HAPPENS.

226
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,667
RULING THE TRIBE
IS SO TEDIOUS.

227
00:12:48,709 --> 00:12:50,417
- THEN YOU SHOULD ENJOY THIS.

228
00:12:50,458 --> 00:12:53,000
WE NEED TO CHECK
ON A SECRET ICE PRISON

229
00:12:53,041 --> 00:12:55,959
IN THE WESTERN TUNDRA.

230
00:12:59,667 --> 00:13:02,709
- YOUR FATHER SENT US A LETTER
YEARS AGO WITH YOUR NAMES,

231
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:04,875
BUT THAT WAS THE LAST
WE HEARD FROM HIM.

232
00:13:04,917 --> 00:13:06,834
THEN WE SAW YOUR PICTURES
IN THE SPORTS PAGES

233
00:13:06,875 --> 00:13:09,166
WITH YOUR BENDING TEAM,
AND BOLIN,

234
00:13:09,208 --> 00:13:11,083
WE LOVE THOSE NUKTUK MOVERS.

235
00:13:11,125 --> 00:13:12,667
THEY'RE HILARIOUS.

236
00:13:12,709 --> 00:13:15,625
- YEAH, THEY'RE NOT REALLY
COMEDIES, BUT, UH--

237
00:13:15,667 --> 00:13:18,417
- YEAH, I COULD PROBABLY
BE A PRO-BENDER,

238
00:13:18,458 --> 00:13:20,166
OR AN ACTOR, OR SOMETHING

239
00:13:20,208 --> 00:13:23,709
IF I LIVED IN A MANSION
IN REPUBLIC CITY LIKE YOU GUYS.

240
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:25,542
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE
HERE ON THE STREETS.

241
00:13:25,583 --> 00:13:27,417
YOU GOTTA BE TOUGH.

242
00:13:27,458 --> 00:13:29,875
- OH, MAKO AND I GREW UP
ON THE STREETS.

243
00:13:29,917 --> 00:13:32,709
WE WERE HOMELESS,
THEN WE WERE KIND OF IN A GANG,

244
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:36,417
THEN WE LIVED IN A GYM.

245
00:13:36,458 --> 00:13:38,375
- HEY, EVERYBODY!
LOOK WHO'S HERE!

246
00:13:38,417 --> 00:13:40,792
SAN'S KIDS,
MAKO AND BOLIN!

247
00:13:40,834 --> 00:13:42,417
- NO WAY.
- COME IN.

248
00:13:42,458 --> 00:13:44,667
- WELCOME.

249
00:13:44,709 --> 00:13:49,166
- IS IT TRUE?
AFTER ALL THESE YEARS?

250
00:13:49,208 --> 00:13:52,417
- BOYS, THIS IS
YOUR GRANDMOTHER, YIN.

251
00:13:52,458 --> 00:13:55,959
- OH, IT IS SO WONDERFUL
TO FINALLY MEET

252
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,917
MY LONG-LOST GRANDCHILDREN.

253
00:14:01,917 --> 00:14:06,125
WHERE IS SAN AND YOUR MOTHER?

254
00:14:06,166 --> 00:14:11,041
- WAIT, YOU MEAN,
YOU DON'T KNOW?

255
00:14:11,083 --> 00:14:13,458
- I'M SORRY.

256
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:14,959
THEY WERE KILLED
WHEN WE WERE LITTLE.

257
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:37,000
- I DON'T LIKE
THE LOOKS OF THIS.

258
00:14:37,041 --> 00:14:38,709
LET'S HURRY UP
AND GET OUT OF HERE.

259
00:14:41,542 --> 00:14:43,792
- YOU HERE TO PICK UP
THE TAX SHIPMENT?

260
00:14:43,834 --> 00:14:45,208
- GO AHEAD AND LOAD IT
ON THE AIRSHIP.

261
00:14:50,709 --> 00:14:52,625
[distant boom]

262
00:15:00,625 --> 00:15:03,000
[engines revving
in the distance]

263
00:15:06,875 --> 00:15:11,709
[bikers yelling and laughing]

264
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:15,291
[men whimpering]

265
00:15:15,333 --> 00:15:17,291
- SO MUCH FOR OUR ESCORTS.

266
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:19,500
- MAYBE WE SHOULD'VE BROUGHT
EVERYBODY ELSE.

267
00:15:22,875 --> 00:15:24,750
[bikers yelling and laughing]

268
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,041
[cheering]

269
00:15:31,083 --> 00:15:35,417
- STEP AWAY FROM THE GOLD,
LADIES, AND YOU WON'T GET HURT.

270
00:15:35,458 --> 00:15:37,583
- SORRY TO DISAPPOINT YOU,
BUT WE'RE TAKING THIS GOLD

271
00:15:37,625 --> 00:15:38,875
BACK TO BA SING SE.

272
00:15:38,917 --> 00:15:41,750
- AW, WE LOVE GALS WITH SPIRIT.

273
00:15:41,792 --> 00:15:44,291
SUIT YOURSELF.

274
00:15:44,333 --> 00:15:46,709
[grunts]

275
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:48,667
[men yelling]

276
00:16:03,083 --> 00:16:04,208
- [screams]

277
00:16:05,583 --> 00:16:07,583
- AAH!

278
00:16:09,875 --> 00:16:12,125
[screams, grunts]

279
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:18,000
- [grunts]
OH!

280
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:25,083
RETREAT! RETREAT!

281
00:16:25,125 --> 00:16:27,792
YOU'RE ON THE WRONG SIDE
OF THIS FIGHT, AVATAR!

282
00:16:27,834 --> 00:16:30,709
THAT GOLD BELONGS TO THE PEOPLE,
NOT THE QUEEN!

283
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:33,750
- WHY DO I GET THE FEELING
HE'S RIGHT?

284
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,917
- WHY DIDN'T ANYONE TELL US
WE HAVE A SECRET PRISON

285
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:45,041
WE COULD HAVE BEEN
THROWING PEOPLE IN?

286
00:16:45,083 --> 00:16:47,542
- I'D LIKE TO PUT MY TAILOR
IN HERE.

287
00:16:47,583 --> 00:16:49,583
HE NEVER GETS MY CUFFS RIGHT.

288
00:16:49,625 --> 00:16:51,083
THEY'RE SO CREASY.

289
00:16:59,041 --> 00:17:01,542
- WE BUILT THIS PLACE SECRETLY
WITH YOUR FATHER

290
00:17:01,583 --> 00:17:04,917
TO HOLD
A VERY SPECIAL PRISONER.

291
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:07,750
SHE'S A POWERFUL FIREBENDER
NAMED P'LI

292
00:17:07,792 --> 00:17:10,667
WHO CAN CREATE EXPLOSIONS
WITH HER MIND.

293
00:17:10,709 --> 00:17:13,625
IRONICALLY, I HIRED A GUY
WITH A SIMILAR ABILITY

294
00:17:13,667 --> 00:17:16,333
TO KILL THE AVATAR
MYSELF ONCE.

295
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,834
DIDN'T WORK.

296
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:23,208
- DON'T FEEL BAD.

297
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:26,583
I TRIED TO KILL KORRA
AFTER SHE RUINED MY WEDDING.

298
00:17:26,625 --> 00:17:28,000
IT HAPPENS.

299
00:17:28,041 --> 00:17:30,625
- LET'S JUST FOCUS
ON KEEPING THIS WOMAN IN PRISON.

300
00:17:40,333 --> 00:17:44,208
- THE INTENSE COLD
PREVENTS HER FROM FIREBENDING.

301
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:47,583
- THERE'S CERTAINLY NO WAY
ANYONE'S BREAKING OUT OF HERE.

302
00:17:47,625 --> 00:17:51,458
- THAT'S WHAT WE THOUGHT
ABOUT THE OTHER THREE PRISONS.

303
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:53,208
- [shivering]

304
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:55,834
MUST BE SOMETHING EXCITING
GOING ON.

305
00:17:55,875 --> 00:17:59,375
NO ONE INTERESTING
HAS VISITED ME IN 13 YEARS.

306
00:17:59,417 --> 00:18:00,959
- DON'T GET USED TO IT.

307
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,625
- HE'S OUT, ISN'T HE?

308
00:18:04,667 --> 00:18:08,333
MMM,
I'M FEELING WARMER ALREADY.

309
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,041
- THIS IS SO GREAT.
WE'VE NEVER HAD A FAMILY BEFORE.

310
00:18:16,083 --> 00:18:20,667
NOW WE'VE GOT...
1, 2, 5, 11...

311
00:18:20,709 --> 00:18:23,333
A BIG FAMILY!
YEAH!

312
00:18:23,375 --> 00:18:25,875
- SO WHY DID DAD LEAVE
BA SING SE?

313
00:18:25,917 --> 00:18:28,375
- OH, HE ALWAYS HAD
BIG DREAMS.

314
00:18:28,417 --> 00:18:30,500
HE COULDN'T WAIT TO GET OUT
AND SEE THE WORLD.

315
00:18:30,542 --> 00:18:32,667
YOUR GRANDFATHER THOUGHT
IT WAS RIDICULOUS.

316
00:18:32,709 --> 00:18:35,875
HE WANTED SAN TO STAY HOME
AND WORK THE FRUIT STAND,

317
00:18:35,917 --> 00:18:40,250
BUT SAN WAS DETERMINED TO LEAVE,
AND THEY HAD A HUGE FIGHT.

318
00:18:40,291 --> 00:18:42,417
AND THAT WAS THE LAST TIME
THEY EVER SPOKE.

319
00:18:42,458 --> 00:18:47,250
OH, UM, SORRY, MOM.

320
00:18:47,291 --> 00:18:49,959
- COME WITH ME.

321
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,500
I HAVE SOMETHING TO SHOW YOU.

322
00:18:56,750 --> 00:19:00,750
THIS IS THE ONLY LETTER
WE EVER GOT FROM SAN.

323
00:19:00,792 --> 00:19:03,291
IT SAYS HE MARRIED
A BEAUTIFUL GIRL

324
00:19:03,333 --> 00:19:08,041
FROM THE FIRE NATION
AND HAD TWO WONDERFUL SONS.

325
00:19:08,083 --> 00:19:11,500
HE SENT THIS PICTURE OF YOU ALL
ON HIS BIRTHDAY.

326
00:19:11,542 --> 00:19:14,875
- LOOK, MAKO.
DAD'S WEARING YOUR SCARF.

327
00:19:14,917 --> 00:19:18,083
- I'M SO SAD THAT I NEVER
GOT TO MEET YOUR MOTHER,

328
00:19:18,125 --> 00:19:20,792
BUT YOU HAVE HER EYES.

329
00:19:20,834 --> 00:19:23,667
I KNOW FROM LOOKING AT YOU TWO
THAT SHE MUST HAVE BEEN

330
00:19:23,709 --> 00:19:26,250
A WONDERFUL BRIDE
FOR MY BOY.

331
00:19:32,875 --> 00:19:35,542
- I'M SURE THEY WOULD WANT YOU
TO HAVE THIS.

332
00:19:47,083 --> 00:19:51,875
- YOUR MAJESTY, THE AVATAR HAS
RETURNED WITH THE TAX PAYMENTS.

333
00:19:51,917 --> 00:19:54,667
- FINALLY.
SECURE IT IN THE VAULT.

334
00:19:54,709 --> 00:19:56,625
- IT'S BEING DONE
AS WE SPEAK.

335
00:19:56,667 --> 00:19:59,208
- SO NOW, YOUR MAJESTY,
IF I COULD START MEETING

336
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:01,333
SOME OF THE AIRBENDERS
HERE IN THE CITY.

337
00:20:01,375 --> 00:20:03,333
- THE DAI LI THOROUGHLY
SEARCHED THE CITY,

338
00:20:03,375 --> 00:20:05,375
BUT IT SEEMS YOUR REPORTS
WERE INCORRECT.

339
00:20:05,417 --> 00:20:08,000
THERE ARE NO AIRBENDERS
IN BA SING SE.

340
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:10,250
SO YOU CAN GATHER
YOUR LITTLE BAND

341
00:20:10,291 --> 00:20:12,625
AND BE ON YOUR WAY
TOMORROW.

342
00:20:12,667 --> 00:20:15,834
- YOU MAKE ME DO YOUR DIRTY WORK
EXTORTING YOUR OWN CITIZENS

343
00:20:15,875 --> 00:20:18,375
FOR YOUR STUPID PALACES
AND TOPIARIES,

344
00:20:18,417 --> 00:20:20,375
AND THEN YOU JUST WANT
TO SEND ME AWAY?

345
00:20:20,417 --> 00:20:23,291
WE'RE NOT GOING ANYWHERE
UNTIL WE FIND SOME AIRBENDERS!

346
00:20:23,333 --> 00:20:25,834
WE KNOW THERE ARE SOME HERE!

347
00:20:25,875 --> 00:20:28,542
- GET HER OUT OF MY SIGHT!

348
00:20:30,041 --> 00:20:31,375
- [whimpers]
- THIS ISN'T OVER!

349
00:20:31,417 --> 00:20:34,083
I'M GOING TO FIND
THE AIRBENDERS!

350
00:20:36,625 --> 00:20:39,792
- YOU KNOW, SAN WOULD HAVE BEEN
SO PROUD OF YOU GUYS.

351
00:20:39,834 --> 00:20:41,750
TRAVELING THE WORLD
WITH THE AVATAR,

352
00:20:41,792 --> 00:20:43,458
HE WOULD HAVE LOVED THAT.

353
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:46,375
- WE ACTUALLY NEED TO GET BACK
TO THE AVATAR IN THE UPPER RING.

354
00:20:46,417 --> 00:20:48,166
- WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE
HELPING HER FIND AIRBENDERS

355
00:20:48,208 --> 00:20:50,583
IN BA SING SE.

356
00:20:50,625 --> 00:20:52,083
[all gasp]

357
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:54,083
- WHAT?
WHAT HAPPENED?

358
00:20:54,125 --> 00:20:57,291
- ONE OF OUR NEIGHBORS STARTED
AIRBENDING ABOUT A WEEK AGO.

359
00:20:57,333 --> 00:21:00,083
A COUPLE DAYS LATER,
TWO DAI LI AGENTS

360
00:21:00,125 --> 00:21:02,166
COME OUT OF NOWHERE
AND SNATCH HIM UP.

361
00:21:02,208 --> 00:21:04,875
NO ONE'S SEEN HIM SINCE.

362
00:21:04,917 --> 00:21:07,583
- THEY SAY THE EARTH QUEEN'S
LOCKING ALL THE AIRBENDERS UP

363
00:21:07,625 --> 00:21:10,917
SOMEWHERE AND USING THEM
FOR EXPERIMENTS.

364
00:21:10,959 --> 00:21:15,458
- TU! DON'T TALK LIKE THAT
ABOUT HER MAJESTY.

365
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:17,917
LONG MAY SHE REIGN.

366
00:21:17,959 --> 00:21:21,166
- WE HAVE TO GET BACK TO
THE UPPER RING AND TELL KORRA.

367
00:21:21,208 --> 00:21:23,959
- I HOPE KAI IS OKAY.

368
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,291
- [whimpering]

369
00:21:27,333 --> 00:21:29,834
- HERE SIR, LET ME HELP YOU.

370
00:21:45,542 --> 00:21:47,542
HEY!
WHAT'S GOING ON?

371
00:21:47,583 --> 00:21:50,375
I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING!
I'M WITH THE AVATAR!

372
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:56,542
[grunts]

373
00:21:56,583 --> 00:22:01,667
- WELCOME TO HER MAJESTY'S ARMY,
FIRST AIRBENDING REGIMENT.

374
00:22:01,709 --> 00:22:06,375
FROM NOW ON, YOU LIVE
TO FIGHT FOR THE EARTH QUEEN.
