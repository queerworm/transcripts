1
00:00:07,547 --> 00:00:09,548
Earth.

2
00:00:09,549 --> 00:00:11,049
Fire.

3
00:00:11,050 --> 00:00:13,051
Air.

4
00:00:13,052 --> 00:00:15,153
Water.

5
00:00:15,154 --> 00:00:18,957
Only the Avatar can master
all four elements

6
00:00:18,958 --> 00:00:21,259
and bring balance to the world.

7
00:00:27,233 --> 00:00:28,834
Unalaq has forced Korra

8
00:00:28,835 --> 00:00:30,368
into opening the northern portal

9
00:00:30,369 --> 00:00:31,970
and trapped Jinora in the spirit world.

10
00:00:31,971 --> 00:00:33,705
Back in Republic City,

11
00:00:33,706 --> 00:00:35,540
everybody loves
Varrick's Nuktuk movers.

12
00:00:35,541 --> 00:00:37,642
Everybody, that is, except Mako,

13
00:00:37,643 --> 00:00:40,178
whose pursuit of Varrick
has landed him in the slammer.

14
00:00:40,179 --> 00:00:41,980
And in the Southern Water Tribe,

15
00:00:41,981 --> 00:00:44,349
Unalaq's army is nearing victory
in the civil war,

16
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:49,350
but Tonraq isn't about
to give up without a fight.

17
00:00:59,899 --> 00:01:01,366
- Dad's back!

18
00:01:06,839 --> 00:01:11,839
- Where's Jinora?

19
00:01:13,646 --> 00:01:17,582
No!

20
00:01:17,583 --> 00:01:20,218
- Her spirit is trapped
in the spirit world,

21
00:01:20,219 --> 00:01:23,021
but she's going to be all right.

22
00:01:23,022 --> 00:01:26,191
- How could this happen?
- It was all my fault.

23
00:01:26,192 --> 00:01:27,626
I should have never let Jinora

24
00:01:27,627 --> 00:01:29,094
enter the spirit world without me.

25
00:01:29,095 --> 00:01:30,395
I couldn't protect her.

26
00:01:30,396 --> 00:01:32,130
- I'm so sorry, Pema.

27
00:01:32,131 --> 00:01:34,633
I tried to save her,
but Unalaq tricked me.

28
00:01:34,634 --> 00:01:37,102
- Don't worry, honey,
I'm not going to stop

29
00:01:37,103 --> 00:01:42,103
until our little girl
is back safe with us.

30
00:01:46,913 --> 00:01:49,281
- You've got a visitor.

31
00:01:49,282 --> 00:01:51,449
- Hey, Mako.
- Hey.

32
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:53,051
What's with the fancy duds?

33
00:01:53,052 --> 00:01:54,452
- I'm on my way to the big finale

34
00:01:54,453 --> 00:01:56,321
for "Nuktuk: Hero of the South."

35
00:01:56,322 --> 00:01:58,223
Yeah, everyone's gonna be there,

36
00:01:58,224 --> 00:02:01,760
except for, you know, you...

37
00:02:01,761 --> 00:02:03,562
because you're in jail and stuff.

38
00:02:03,563 --> 00:02:04,963
- Thanks for the reminder.

39
00:02:04,964 --> 00:02:06,464
- Hey, I brought you something.

40
00:02:06,465 --> 00:02:08,333
I thought this would
brighten up your new place.

41
00:02:08,334 --> 00:02:09,734
Read the inscription.

42
00:02:09,735 --> 00:02:14,735
- "Dear Mako,
Nuktuk says, 'Keep smiling.'"

43
00:02:15,007 --> 00:02:18,210
Did you come by
just to give me a poster?

44
00:02:18,211 --> 00:02:22,047
- No, I came by to give you my sincere,

45
00:02:22,048 --> 00:02:24,082
heartfelt words of encouragement.

46
00:02:24,083 --> 00:02:25,684
I know our lives have been moving

47
00:02:25,685 --> 00:02:28,119
in two different directions,
but I want you to know

48
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,888
that I will always be there for you.

49
00:02:29,889 --> 00:02:31,656
We are brothers, after all,

50
00:02:31,657 --> 00:02:33,525
even if one of us is
a member of high society

51
00:02:33,526 --> 00:02:35,861
and the other one is a criminal.
- I am not a criminal!

52
00:02:35,862 --> 00:02:37,662
- Of course I know that,

53
00:02:37,663 --> 00:02:39,764
but you do kinda look like one,

54
00:02:39,765 --> 00:02:42,534
'cause you're in a jail,
and that's where criminals live.

55
00:02:42,535 --> 00:02:43,869
- I was set up!

56
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:46,504
Varrick knew I had figured out
he was hiring gangsters

57
00:02:46,505 --> 00:02:48,840
to pose as Northern soldiers
to get Republic City

58
00:02:48,841 --> 00:02:50,408
to join the war.

59
00:02:50,409 --> 00:02:52,143
That's why he had me arrested.

60
00:02:52,144 --> 00:02:54,246
- Ah, I see what you're doing.

61
00:02:54,247 --> 00:02:56,448
You're going for the insanity defense.

62
00:02:56,449 --> 00:02:58,250
Smart.
- No!

63
00:02:58,251 --> 00:03:01,119
I'm trying to tell you that
Varrick isn't what he seems.

64
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,054
Where's Asami?
She'll listen to me.

65
00:03:03,055 --> 00:03:04,122
- I asked her to come,

66
00:03:04,123 --> 00:03:05,724
but she said it was too hard for her.

67
00:03:05,725 --> 00:03:07,993
You being in jail like this

68
00:03:07,994 --> 00:03:10,762
reminds her of her dad.

69
00:03:10,763 --> 00:03:12,831
Okay, gotta run,
but I'll be back tomorrow.

70
00:03:12,832 --> 00:03:14,900
And I am gonna get you
the best attorney

71
00:03:14,901 --> 00:03:17,135
fame and fortune can buy.

72
00:03:17,136 --> 00:03:18,503
- Bolin, wait.

73
00:03:18,504 --> 00:03:20,605
If my theory about Varrick is right,

74
00:03:20,606 --> 00:03:23,041
something might go down tonight
at your premiere.

75
00:03:23,042 --> 00:03:24,676
Promise me
you'll keep your eyes peeled.

76
00:03:24,677 --> 00:03:26,444
Yeah, okay, big brother.

77
00:03:26,445 --> 00:03:29,114
I promise.

78
00:03:29,115 --> 00:03:31,950
Whew! That insanity defense
is definitely gonna work.

79
00:03:37,256 --> 00:03:38,823
- Should we wait another day?

80
00:03:38,824 --> 00:03:41,192
Korra still might come
with reinforcements.

81
00:03:41,193 --> 00:03:43,061
- We can't wait any longer.

82
00:03:43,062 --> 00:03:45,830
It's time we take back what is ours!

83
00:03:45,831 --> 00:03:48,066
It's time to take back our city!

84
00:04:11,524 --> 00:04:13,925
- Say "Nuktuk."

85
00:04:16,362 --> 00:04:17,829
- There they are, folks,

86
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:19,764
the sweethearts of the big screen,

87
00:04:19,765 --> 00:04:22,767
and Republic City's most famous couple,

88
00:04:22,768 --> 00:04:25,270
Bolin and Ginger.

89
00:04:25,271 --> 00:04:29,040
- Let me get a picture.

90
00:04:29,041 --> 00:04:30,075
- Wow, that was fun.

91
00:04:30,076 --> 00:04:31,409
And did you hear what Shiro said?

92
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:34,012
We're Republic City's
most famous couple.

93
00:04:34,013 --> 00:04:35,513
- Bolin, you're a doll,

94
00:04:35,514 --> 00:04:38,650
but you're as dumb
as the rocks you bend.

95
00:04:38,651 --> 00:04:40,585
We are not a couple.

96
00:04:40,586 --> 00:04:45,586
- That's not what Shiro said.

97
00:04:46,125 --> 00:04:48,460
- Stop stuffing your mustaches
with Varri-cakes

98
00:04:48,461 --> 00:04:49,728
and get to your post!

99
00:04:49,729 --> 00:04:51,162
- You got it, Boss.

100
00:04:51,163 --> 00:04:53,331
- You two are the pinnacle
of refinement.

101
00:04:53,332 --> 00:04:55,567
- This star-studded event
just keeps getting

102
00:04:55,568 --> 00:04:57,302
star-studdier, folks.

103
00:04:57,303 --> 00:04:58,937
President Raiko
and the First Lady,

104
00:04:58,938 --> 00:05:00,972
Buttercup Raiko,
just arrived.

105
00:05:00,973 --> 00:05:03,375
And they're being greeted
by entrepreneur extraordinaire,

106
00:05:03,376 --> 00:05:04,609
Varrick.

107
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:08,246
- There they are,
my two most honored guests.

108
00:05:08,247 --> 00:05:10,448
Mwah!
What do you think?

109
00:05:10,449 --> 00:05:12,851
No expense has been spared.

110
00:05:12,852 --> 00:05:15,320
I brought in the finest
entertainers from Ba Sing Se

111
00:05:15,321 --> 00:05:17,255
and the best food
from around the world.

112
00:05:17,256 --> 00:05:18,790
Heck, I even had this red carpet

113
00:05:18,791 --> 00:05:20,558
imported from the Fire Nation.

114
00:05:20,559 --> 00:05:23,628
They make the best red stuff
over there.

115
00:05:23,629 --> 00:05:28,166
Fact!
All right, picture time!

116
00:05:28,167 --> 00:05:30,268
- Varrick, you didn't
have to do all this for us.

117
00:05:30,269 --> 00:05:32,037
- I wanted to.

118
00:05:32,038 --> 00:05:34,873
Mr. President,
I took one look at your wife,

119
00:05:34,874 --> 00:05:38,977
and I knew that you
were a man of exquisite taste.

120
00:05:38,978 --> 00:05:41,946
And that's why I know
you're gonna love this mover!

121
00:05:41,947 --> 00:05:43,782
- Varrick,
I know what you're doing,

122
00:05:43,783 --> 00:05:46,584
and I doubt your propaganda
is going to change my mind

123
00:05:46,585 --> 00:05:48,920
about going to war
with the Northern Water Tribe.

124
00:05:48,921 --> 00:05:51,122
- Oh, I think you'll be surprised

125
00:05:51,123 --> 00:05:56,123
how persuasive I can be.

126
00:06:07,339 --> 00:06:09,607
Thank you all for coming to the finale

127
00:06:09,608 --> 00:06:12,911
of "Nuktuk: Hero of the South."

128
00:06:12,912 --> 00:06:15,046
You know,
when I first started this project,

129
00:06:15,047 --> 00:06:17,549
there were a lot
of naysayers out there.

130
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:19,884
"You can't make pictures move,"
they said.

131
00:06:19,885 --> 00:06:21,986
"You can't take
some knucklehead Earthbender

132
00:06:21,987 --> 00:06:24,522
and make him a star,"
they said.

133
00:06:24,523 --> 00:06:27,759
"You can't teach
a polar bear dog to speak," they said.

134
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:30,395
Well, they're wrong.

135
00:06:30,396 --> 00:06:32,397
Thanks to the magic
of the movers,

136
00:06:32,398 --> 00:06:34,599
our furry friends
have found their voices.

137
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:38,970
And you'll be shocked to hear
what they have to say.

138
00:06:38,971 --> 00:06:41,439
They speak of the injustice
that's happening

139
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:44,375
in the Southern Water Tribe right now.

140
00:06:44,376 --> 00:06:48,713
My hope is that their words
and this epic mover

141
00:06:48,714 --> 00:06:51,316
will inspire a real-life hero

142
00:06:51,317 --> 00:06:55,520
to rise up and help.

143
00:06:55,521 --> 00:06:58,456
Thank you again.
Enjoy the show.

144
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:02,961
- When last we left our hero,

145
00:07:02,962 --> 00:07:05,063
he was captured by the evil Unalaq's

146
00:07:05,064 --> 00:07:06,598
dastardly pet bird.

147
00:07:06,599 --> 00:07:09,267
Amazingly, with the power
of his whistling,

148
00:07:09,268 --> 00:07:10,368
Nuktuk escaped...

149
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:17,542
- And decided to seek out counsel.

150
00:07:20,112 --> 00:07:21,546
- Thank you, wise sage.

151
00:07:21,547 --> 00:07:23,748
I will travel to Republic City
and seek help.

152
00:07:27,953 --> 00:07:29,053
- Have a seat.

153
00:07:29,054 --> 00:07:32,123
I'm just working on a cure
for the common cold.

154
00:07:32,124 --> 00:07:35,193
No longer will my citizens
suffer from the sniffles.

155
00:07:35,194 --> 00:07:37,295
- Mr. President,
there's something more important

156
00:07:37,296 --> 00:07:38,696
than the sniffles right now.

157
00:07:38,697 --> 00:07:41,633
I need your help
to stop the evil Unalaq.

158
00:07:41,634 --> 00:07:43,635
- Did you say "help"?

159
00:07:43,636 --> 00:07:45,870
If there is one thing I love doing,

160
00:07:45,871 --> 00:07:47,639
it's helping people-

161
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:50,108
- The seal-lion
seemed a bit far-fetched,

162
00:07:50,109 --> 00:07:51,743
but the portrayal of this president

163
00:07:51,744 --> 00:07:56,581
is right on the money.

164
00:07:56,582 --> 00:07:59,651
- I think this is your best mover yet.

165
00:07:59,652 --> 00:08:04,652
- I just wish Mako was here to see it.

166
00:08:18,804 --> 00:08:22,574
- Mmm. I like to eat the top
off the Varri-cake first.

167
00:08:22,575 --> 00:08:24,409
- I just try to shove the whole thing

168
00:08:24,410 --> 00:08:29,410
in my mouth at once.

169
00:08:30,282 --> 00:08:32,784
I love our job.

170
00:08:32,785 --> 00:08:35,119
- Huh?

171
00:08:48,234 --> 00:08:51,135
- Northern Water Tribe automatons!

172
00:08:51,136 --> 00:08:53,037
Nooo!

173
00:08:53,038 --> 00:08:57,175
- Bee bo bop,
Nuktuk cannot stop Unalaq.

174
00:08:57,176 --> 00:08:59,344
Must destroy Nuktuk.

175
00:09:08,621 --> 00:09:10,021
- Ha ha!

176
00:09:10,022 --> 00:09:13,057
Aah!

177
00:09:13,058 --> 00:09:15,827
- Looks like you forgot
that water and automatons

178
00:09:15,828 --> 00:09:17,328
don't mix.

179
00:09:17,329 --> 00:09:19,130
- Beep bop boo.

180
00:09:19,131 --> 00:09:23,801
Oh, no, circuits not working.

181
00:09:23,802 --> 00:09:26,070
We did it!

182
00:09:26,071 --> 00:09:28,740
But wait.
Where's Juji?

183
00:09:30,609 --> 00:09:33,278
- Nuk-no!

184
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:35,647
- You can't die, Juji.

185
00:09:35,648 --> 00:09:37,448
Not on my watch.

186
00:09:39,084 --> 00:09:41,352
It's okay, Nuktuk.

187
00:09:41,353 --> 00:09:45,490
At least I got to be...

188
00:09:45,491 --> 00:09:49,827
Your friend.

189
00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:56,730
" Juji!

190
00:10:05,344 --> 00:10:06,577
- Are you okay?

191
00:10:06,578 --> 00:10:09,647
It seems like this mover
is really getting to you.

192
00:10:09,648 --> 00:10:11,749
You do know Juji's not really dead?

193
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:14,519
- Of course I know.
Juji's fine.

194
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:16,020
He comes back to life in the end

195
00:10:16,021 --> 00:10:18,523
when the doomsday device shifts
the polarity of the Earth.

196
00:10:18,524 --> 00:10:21,826
Oops. Spoiler.
Sorry.

197
00:10:21,827 --> 00:10:23,294
- Then what's wrong?

198
00:10:23,295 --> 00:10:26,397
- I guess I just miss my friends.

199
00:10:26,398 --> 00:10:28,366
Everything is going so well for me,

200
00:10:28,367 --> 00:10:31,736
but it feels empty
without everyone around.

201
00:10:31,737 --> 00:10:35,606
Korra's gone, Mako's in jail,
you're doing...

202
00:10:35,607 --> 00:10:37,508
business lady stuff.

203
00:10:37,509 --> 00:10:39,777
Team Avatar's fallen apart.

204
00:10:39,778 --> 00:10:41,512
- I know.

205
00:10:41,513 --> 00:10:46,284
Things have changed so much
since we first met.

206
00:10:46,285 --> 00:10:47,485
Why don't you come back in

207
00:10:47,486 --> 00:10:49,053
and finish watching
the mover with me?

208
00:10:49,054 --> 00:10:54,054
- You go ahead.
I need another minute.

209
00:10:59,865 --> 00:11:04,865
That's weird.

210
00:11:07,539 --> 00:11:10,742
Whoa--ahh!

211
00:11:10,743 --> 00:11:14,145
Ugh!

212
00:11:23,989 --> 00:11:25,623
- They're after the president!

213
00:11:30,629 --> 00:11:33,097
- You're too late, Nuktuk.

214
00:11:33,098 --> 00:11:36,701
Soon, my doomsday device
will shoot this block of ice

215
00:11:36,702 --> 00:11:40,471
into the earth's core,
freezing the entire planet.

216
00:11:40,472 --> 00:11:44,575
And I will be the ruler of Ice Earth!

217
00:11:48,414 --> 00:11:53,414
- I don't think so.

218
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:56,554
I don't think so!

219
00:11:58,390 --> 00:12:00,057
- Huh! Ha!

220
00:12:12,638 --> 00:12:17,608
- Mr. President, get back!
I'm here to help.

221
00:12:27,386 --> 00:12:32,156
Looks like there's nowhere to go.

222
00:12:36,128 --> 00:12:41,128
- Secure the president
and call for backup immediately!

223
00:12:56,448 --> 00:13:01,448
- Nuktuk, look out!
- Bolin, look out!

224
00:13:10,796 --> 00:13:13,931
- Hyah!

225
00:13:13,932 --> 00:13:15,766
- This is unbelievable!

226
00:13:15,767 --> 00:13:17,502
Bolin is bending two full stacks

227
00:13:17,503 --> 00:13:20,571
of earth discs at once,
which would normally be illegal.

228
00:13:20,572 --> 00:13:23,174
But then again, he's fighting
three Waterbenders,

229
00:13:23,175 --> 00:13:28,175
so all rules are out the window.

230
00:13:41,226 --> 00:13:42,593
- Tell me who sent you!

231
00:13:42,594 --> 00:13:46,731
- It was Varrick.
Please don't hurt me, Nuktuk!

232
00:13:50,469 --> 00:13:53,771
- I think this is our cue to exit.

233
00:13:53,772 --> 00:13:58,772
- Where do you think you're going?

234
00:14:03,515 --> 00:14:05,416
- It's a knockout!

235
00:14:22,834 --> 00:14:27,834
- They're falling back.

236
00:14:45,057 --> 00:14:46,757
- Varrick's plan was to kidnap you

237
00:14:46,758 --> 00:14:48,059
and blame it on the North.

238
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:50,127
Then Republic City would have no choice

239
00:14:50,128 --> 00:14:52,363
but to join the war
on the side of the South.

240
00:14:52,364 --> 00:14:54,832
- I can't believe Varrick
would do something like this,

241
00:14:54,833 --> 00:14:56,000
and no one saw it coming.

242
00:14:56,001 --> 00:15:00,605
- Actually, someone did.
Remember Mako?

243
00:15:00,606 --> 00:15:02,440
- You've got a great officer
on your hands.

244
00:15:02,441 --> 00:15:03,808
- He's one of the best.

245
00:15:07,112 --> 00:15:08,512
- Mwah!

246
00:15:08,513 --> 00:15:12,683
I can't believe my boyfriend
is a real-life hero.

247
00:15:12,684 --> 00:15:14,852
- Boyfriend?
Wait, stop.

248
00:15:14,853 --> 00:15:17,188
I thought you said
we weren't a couple.

249
00:15:17,189 --> 00:15:19,991
- You really are as dumb
as those rocks.

250
00:15:19,992 --> 00:15:22,360
Of course we're a couple.

251
00:15:22,361 --> 00:15:24,362
- Bolin, you saved the president.

252
00:15:24,363 --> 00:15:26,597
And you proved Mako was right all along.

253
00:15:26,598 --> 00:15:27,765
We have to go tell him what happened.

254
00:15:27,766 --> 00:15:30,501
- Yeah.

255
00:15:30,502 --> 00:15:32,436
- Oh, you meant right now.

256
00:15:36,375 --> 00:15:40,144
- President Raiko...
- Avatar Korra, what's wrong?

257
00:15:40,145 --> 00:15:42,380
- Sir, I know I've asked
for your help before,

258
00:15:42,381 --> 00:15:43,914
but things have changed.

259
00:15:43,915 --> 00:15:47,284
Unalaq doesn't just want
to take over the South anymore.

260
00:15:47,285 --> 00:15:52,285
He wants to destroy the whole world.

261
00:15:56,261 --> 00:15:58,295
- Unalaq is gonna destroy the world?

262
00:15:58,296 --> 00:16:00,798
He really does have a doomsday device?

263
00:16:00,799 --> 00:16:02,700
- He's trying to release
a powerful dark spirit

264
00:16:02,701 --> 00:16:04,001
during harmonic convergence,

265
00:16:04,002 --> 00:16:06,003
which is only a few days away.

266
00:16:06,004 --> 00:16:10,141
If he succeeds,
the world as we know it is over.

267
00:16:10,142 --> 00:16:14,612
Sir, we desperately need your help.

268
00:16:14,613 --> 00:16:18,249
- I'm sorry, Korra,
but my answer is still no.

269
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:19,583
- There are lives on the line!

270
00:16:19,584 --> 00:16:21,118
And my daughter is one of them.

271
00:16:21,119 --> 00:16:23,587
Raiko, you must reconsider.

272
00:16:23,588 --> 00:16:25,623
- I'm aware that lives are on the line,

273
00:16:25,624 --> 00:16:28,225
and that's precisely why
my troops are staying here.

274
00:16:28,226 --> 00:16:30,227
If the world is going
to be thrown into chaos,

275
00:16:30,228 --> 00:16:32,963
like you claim,
I need to protect my citizens.

276
00:16:32,964 --> 00:16:34,765
I'm sorry.
- Sir...

277
00:16:34,766 --> 00:16:36,434
Nuktuk needs your help.

278
00:16:36,435 --> 00:16:39,270
I know you love helping people.

279
00:16:39,271 --> 00:16:41,739
- Son, I appreciate you saving my life,

280
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:43,107
and I'm a big fan of your work,

281
00:16:43,108 --> 00:16:48,108
but my decision is final.

282
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:49,714
- I never should have saved that guy.

283
00:16:49,715 --> 00:16:51,816
- If you guys need help,
I'm here for you.

284
00:16:51,817 --> 00:16:52,950
- Yeah, me too.

285
00:16:52,951 --> 00:16:54,218
- Thank you.

286
00:16:54,219 --> 00:16:57,088
It's so good to see you guys again.

287
00:16:57,089 --> 00:17:02,089
Wait, where's Mako?

288
00:17:03,428 --> 00:17:05,496
- So how was the big premiere?

289
00:17:05,497 --> 00:17:08,799
- I saved the president!
In real life!

290
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,267
- Wait, what?

291
00:17:10,268 --> 00:17:11,736
- You were right about Varrick.

292
00:17:11,737 --> 00:17:13,404
He tried to kidnap Raiko!

293
00:17:13,405 --> 00:17:14,839
- I knew it.

294
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:16,307
- But it didn't work, because of you.

295
00:17:16,308 --> 00:17:17,608
And because of me.

296
00:17:17,609 --> 00:17:19,443
Let's just say we both did good.

297
00:17:19,444 --> 00:17:23,481
Beifong says you're free to go.

298
00:17:23,482 --> 00:17:25,182
Sorry for ever doubting you, Mako.

299
00:17:25,183 --> 00:17:29,420
- Don't worry about it, bro.

300
00:17:37,896 --> 00:17:39,430
- Nice job, Mako.

301
00:17:39,431 --> 00:17:41,565
You're going to make a great detective.

302
00:17:41,566 --> 00:17:44,468
- But, Chief, there aren't any
detective openings right now.

303
00:17:44,469 --> 00:17:49,469
- Actually, we have two openings.

304
00:17:54,279 --> 00:17:55,579
- Mwah.

305
00:17:55,580 --> 00:18:00,580
Mako, I missed you so much.

306
00:18:02,053 --> 00:18:03,254
- Oh, yeah, did I forget to tell you?

307
00:18:03,255 --> 00:18:04,455
Korra's back.

308
00:18:04,456 --> 00:18:08,159
- Korra, hey,
I missed you too.

309
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,693
So you're not still mad at me?

310
00:18:09,694 --> 00:18:12,329
- Why would I be mad?

311
00:18:12,330 --> 00:18:15,533
- We had that fight
before you left, remember?

312
00:18:15,534 --> 00:18:18,135
- No, not really.

313
00:18:18,136 --> 00:18:20,204
I got attacked by a dark spirit,

314
00:18:20,205 --> 00:18:22,106
and I lost my memory for a little while.

315
00:18:22,107 --> 00:18:24,809
Maybe it hasn't all come back yet.

316
00:18:24,810 --> 00:18:28,012
Was it a bad fight?

317
00:18:28,013 --> 00:18:31,649
- Uh...

318
00:18:31,650 --> 00:18:33,050
mm...no.

319
00:18:33,051 --> 00:18:38,051
No, it-- it wasn't that bad.

320
00:18:40,425 --> 00:18:42,626
- Korra, we don't have much time.

321
00:18:42,627 --> 00:18:45,396
We need to figure out
how to deal with Unalaq.

322
00:18:45,397 --> 00:18:48,666
- I think I know
just the man to talk to.

323
00:18:50,535 --> 00:18:53,537
- Guys, hey!
What do you think?

324
00:18:53,538 --> 00:18:55,206
Varrick Industries built this prison,

325
00:18:55,207 --> 00:18:57,408
and I had this cell made special.

326
00:18:57,409 --> 00:19:00,244
I had a feeling I'd end up here one day.

327
00:19:00,245 --> 00:19:02,847
Zhu Li, come on!
We got guests.

328
00:19:02,848 --> 00:19:05,316
Whip up a pot
of that green tea I love.

329
00:19:05,317 --> 00:19:06,750
- Yes, sir.

330
00:19:06,751 --> 00:19:08,452
- Zhu Li's in prison with you?

331
00:19:08,453 --> 00:19:10,187
- Of course.
I don't go anywhere

332
00:19:10,188 --> 00:19:11,956
without my assistant.
Do you?

333
00:19:11,957 --> 00:19:13,357
- We're not interested in your tea,

334
00:19:13,358 --> 00:19:14,558
and this isn't a friendly visit.

335
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:16,427
- Don't tell me you guys are still mad

336
00:19:16,428 --> 00:19:18,095
about everything that happened.

337
00:19:18,096 --> 00:19:20,231
I did some good things too.

338
00:19:20,232 --> 00:19:22,867
Korra, who warned you
about Unalaq?

339
00:19:22,868 --> 00:19:24,134
I did.

340
00:19:24,135 --> 00:19:26,537
Bolin, who got you into the movers?

341
00:19:26,538 --> 00:19:27,638
I did.

342
00:19:27,639 --> 00:19:29,607
Asami, who saved your company?

343
00:19:29,608 --> 00:19:31,075
I did.

344
00:19:31,076 --> 00:19:33,210
Mako, who got you thrown in jail?

345
00:19:33,211 --> 00:19:34,345
I did!

346
00:19:34,346 --> 00:19:35,913
Oh, yeah,
I guess that was a bad thing.

347
00:19:35,914 --> 00:19:37,748
- You stole everything from me,

348
00:19:37,749 --> 00:19:39,416
and you tried to kidnap the president.

349
00:19:39,417 --> 00:19:40,584
Those are pretty bad too.

350
00:19:40,585 --> 00:19:42,353
- I wasn't going to hurt him.

351
00:19:42,354 --> 00:19:44,521
I just needed to start a war.

352
00:19:44,522 --> 00:19:45,723
Well, a bigger war.

353
00:19:45,724 --> 00:19:46,991
- Well, we're gonna end it.

354
00:19:46,992 --> 00:19:48,859
Where's all the stuff
you stole from Asami?

355
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:51,395
- The Future Industries stuff?
It's on my battleship.

356
00:19:51,396 --> 00:19:53,197
- You have a battleship?

357
00:19:53,198 --> 00:19:54,632
- Of course I do!

358
00:19:54,633 --> 00:19:57,134
I bought the first one they made,

359
00:19:57,135 --> 00:19:59,169
named her the Zhu Li.

360
00:19:59,170 --> 00:20:02,606
- You named your battleship
after your assistant?

361
00:20:02,607 --> 00:20:06,377
- Yep. They're both cold,
heartless war machines.

362
00:20:06,378 --> 00:20:09,313
- Your tea, sir.

363
00:20:09,314 --> 00:20:12,049
- Look, I am truly sorry
for the mess I caused.

364
00:20:12,050 --> 00:20:16,620
Let me make it up to you.
Take Zhu Li.

365
00:20:16,621 --> 00:20:19,924
My battleship,
it's yours, and everything on it.

366
00:20:19,925 --> 00:20:22,059
- It's not the fleet
we were looking for,

367
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:23,661
but it's the next best thing.

368
00:20:23,662 --> 00:20:24,962
- All right!

369
00:20:24,963 --> 00:20:26,764
Team Avatar is back in business!

370
00:20:35,941 --> 00:20:39,109
- It's okay.
We're going to stop Unalaq

371
00:20:39,110 --> 00:20:40,744
and get Jinora back.

372
00:20:40,745 --> 00:20:44,581
- I hope my dad's all right.

373
00:20:44,582 --> 00:20:49,186
- I'm sure he's fine.

374
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:07,600
Get the men and fall back.
- What about you?

375
00:21:11,176 --> 00:21:13,978
- I'm going to end this right now.

376
00:21:13,979 --> 00:21:16,080
Go!

377
00:21:26,725 --> 00:21:31,725
- Hello, Tonraq.
Looking for me?

378
00:21:40,338 --> 00:21:42,940
- Brother,
I'm too strong for you.

379
00:21:42,941 --> 00:21:45,676
- You're no brother of mine.
You betrayed me.

380
00:21:45,677 --> 00:21:47,277
You had me banished.

381
00:21:47,278 --> 00:21:50,948
- Yes, I did.

382
00:21:55,487 --> 00:21:59,757
- Stop!
He's mine.

383
00:21:59,758 --> 00:22:01,725
- You are not the true chief.

384
00:22:01,726 --> 00:22:06,726
- I am.
And you will bow to me.

385
00:23:07,759 --> 00:23:10,494
- Now that I've defeated you,

386
00:23:10,495 --> 00:23:15,495
your daughter is next.
