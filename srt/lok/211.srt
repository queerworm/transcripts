00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:08,583
- EARTH...

00:00:08,625 --> 00:00:10,500
FIRE...

00:00:10,542 --> 00:00:11,834
AIR...

00:00:11,875 --> 00:00:14,917
WATER.

5
00:00:14,959 --> 00:00:18,500
ONLY THE AVATAR
CAN MASTER ALL FOUR ELEMENTS

6
00:00:18,542 --> 00:00:21,709
AND BRING BALANCE
TO THE WORLD.

7
00:00:27,333 --> 00:00:28,834
- UNALAQ HAS FORCED KORRA

8
00:00:28,875 --> 00:00:30,291
INTO OPENING
THE NORTHERN PORTAL

9
00:00:30,333 --> 00:00:31,792
AND TRAPPED JINORA
IN THE SPIRIT WORLD.

10
00:00:31,834 --> 00:00:32,959
BACK IN REPUBLIC CITY,

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,750
EVERYBODY LOVES VARRICK'S
NUKTUK MOVERS.

12
00:00:34,792 --> 00:00:36,875
EVERYBODY, THAT IS,
EXCEPT MAKO,

13
00:00:36,917 --> 00:00:39,291
WHOSE PURSUIT OF VARRICK
HAS LANDED HIM IN THE SLAMMER.

14
00:00:39,333 --> 00:00:41,291
AND IN THE SOUTHERN
WATER TRIBE,

15
00:00:41,333 --> 00:00:44,375
UNALAQ'S ARMY IS NEARING VICTORY
IN THE CIVIL WAR.

16
00:00:44,417 --> 00:00:46,417
BUT TONRAQ ISN'T ABOUT
TO GIVE UP WITHOUT A FIGHT.

17

[Oogi bellows]

18
00:00:54,166 --> 00:00:57,291

[Oogi bellows]

20
00:00:59,959 --> 00:01:00,583
- DAD'S BACK!

21

[Oogi bellows]

22
00:01:06,583 --> 00:01:08,583
- WHERE'S JINORA?

23
00:01:13,125 --> 00:01:14,417
NO!

24
00:01:16,917 --> 00:01:20,083
- HER SPIRIT IS TRAPPED
IN THE SPIRIT WORLD,

25
00:01:20,125 --> 00:01:21,959
BUT SHE'S GOING
TO BE ALL RIGHT.

26
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,583
- HOW COULD THIS HAPPEN?
- IT WAS ALL MY FAULT.

27
00:01:25,625 --> 00:01:27,834
I SHOULD HAVE NEVER LET JINORA

28
00:01:27,875 --> 00:01:29,166
ENTER THE SPIRIT WORLD
WITHOUT ME.

29
00:01:29,208 --> 00:01:30,542
I COULDN'T PROTECT HER.

30
00:01:30,583 --> 00:01:31,959
- I'M SO SORRY, PEMA.

31
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,583
I TRIED TO SAVE HER,
BUT UNALAQ TRICKED ME.

32
00:01:34,625 --> 00:01:36,917
- DON'T WORRY, HONEY,
I'M NOT GOING TO STOP

33
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:40,792
UNTIL OUR LITTLE GIRL
IS BACK SAFE WITH US.

34
00:01:45,083 --> 00:01:46,291
[door rattles open]

35
00:01:46,333 --> 00:01:49,083
- YOU'VE GOT A VISITOR.

36
00:01:49,125 --> 00:01:51,291
- HEY, MAKO.
- HEY.

37
00:01:51,333 --> 00:01:52,792
WHAT'S WITH THE FANCY DUDS?

38
00:01:52,834 --> 00:01:54,333
- I'M ON MY WAY
TO THE BIG FINALE

39
00:01:54,375 --> 00:01:56,166
FOR<i> NUKTUK: HERO OF THE SOUTH.</i>

40
00:01:56,208 --> 00:01:58,041
YEAH, EVERYONE'S
GONNA BE THERE,

41
00:01:58,083 --> 00:02:01,792
EXCEPT FOR, YOU KNOW, YOU...

42
00:02:01,834 --> 00:02:03,542
BECAUSE YOU'RE IN JAIL
AND STUFF.

43
00:02:03,583 --> 00:02:04,792
- THANKS FOR THE REMINDER.

44
00:02:04,834 --> 00:02:06,417
- HEY, I BROUGHT YOU
SOMETHING.

45
00:02:06,458 --> 00:02:08,333
I THOUGHT THIS WOULD
BRIGHTEN UP YOUR NEW PLACE.

46
00:02:08,375 --> 00:02:09,834
READ THE INSCRIPTION.

47
00:02:09,875 --> 00:02:14,917
- "DEAR MAKO, NUKTUK SAYS,
'KEEP SMILING.'"

48
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:16,959
DID YOU COME BY
JUST TO GIVE ME A POSTER?

49
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,959
- NO, I CAME BY
TO GIVE YOU MY SINCERE,

50
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
HEARTFELT WORDS
OF ENCOURAGEMENT.

51
00:02:24,041 --> 00:02:25,750
I KNOW OUR LIVES
HAVE BEEN MOVING

52
00:02:25,792 --> 00:02:28,000
IN TWO DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS,
BUT I WANT YOU TO KNOW

53
00:02:28,041 --> 00:02:29,709
THAT I WILL ALWAYS
BE THERE FOR YOU.

54
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:31,667
WE ARE BROTHERS,
AFTER ALL,

55
00:02:31,709 --> 00:02:33,417
EVEN IF ONE OF US IS A MEMBER
OF HIGH SOCIETY

56
00:02:33,458 --> 00:02:34,500
AND THE OTHER ONE
IS A CRIMINAL.

57
00:02:34,542 --> 00:02:35,709
- I AM NOT A CRIMINAL!

58
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:37,709
- OF COURSE<i> I</i> KNOW THAT,

59
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:39,834
BUT YOU DO KINDA
LOOK LIKE ONE,

60
00:02:39,875 --> 00:02:42,291
'CAUSE YOU'RE IN A JAIL,
AND THAT'S WHERE CRIMINALS LIVE.

61
00:02:42,333 --> 00:02:43,959
- I WAS SET UP!

62
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,500
VARRICK KNEW I HAD FIGURED OUT
HE WAS HIRING GANGSTERS

63
00:02:46,542 --> 00:02:48,667
TO POSE AS NORTHERN SOLDIERS
TO GET REPUBLIC CITY

64
00:02:48,709 --> 00:02:50,375
TO JOIN THE WAR.

65
00:02:50,417 --> 00:02:52,041
THAT'S WHY HE HAD ME ARRESTED.

66
00:02:52,083 --> 00:02:54,166
- AH, I SEE
WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

67
00:02:54,208 --> 00:02:56,417
YOU'RE GOING FOR
THE INSANITY DEFENSE.

68
00:02:56,458 --> 00:02:58,166
SMART.
- NO!

69
00:02:58,208 --> 00:03:01,083
I'M TRYING TO TELL YOU THAT
VARRICK ISN'T WHAT HE SEEMS.

70
00:03:01,125 --> 00:03:03,041
WHERE'S ASAMI?
SHE'LL LISTEN TO ME.

71
00:03:03,083 --> 00:03:04,083
- I ASKED HER TO COME,

72
00:03:04,125 --> 00:03:05,583
BUT SHE SAID
IT WAS TOO HARD FOR HER.

73
00:03:05,625 --> 00:03:07,458
YOU BEING IN JAIL LIKE THIS

74
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:10,917
REMINDS HER OF HER DAD.

75
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:12,750
OKAY, GOTTA RUN,
BUT I'LL BE BACK TOMORROW.

76
00:03:12,792 --> 00:03:14,834
AND I AM GONNA GET YOU
THE BEST ATTORNEY

77
00:03:14,875 --> 00:03:17,166
FAME AND FORTUNE CAN BUY.

78
00:03:17,208 --> 00:03:18,625
- BOLIN, WAIT.

79
00:03:18,667 --> 00:03:20,750
IF MY THEORY ABOUT VARRICK
IS RIGHT,

80
00:03:20,792 --> 00:03:23,041
SOMETHING MIGHT GO DOWN TONIGHT
AT YOUR PREMIERE.

81
00:03:23,083 --> 00:03:24,834
PROMISE ME YOU'LL
KEEP YOUR EYES PEELED.

82
00:03:24,875 --> 00:03:26,291
- [chuckles]
YEAH, OKAY, BIG BROTHER.

83
00:03:26,333 --> 00:03:28,250
I PROMISE.

84
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:31,917
WHEW! THAT INSANITY DEFENSE
IS DEFINITELY GONNA WORK.

85
00:03:31,959 --> 00:03:32,917
[door slams]

86
00:03:36,667 --> 00:03:39,000
- SHOULD WE WAIT ANOTHER DAY?

87
00:03:39,041 --> 00:03:41,208
KORRA STILL MIGHT COME
WITH REINFORCEMENTS.

88
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:43,041
- WE CAN'T WAIT ANY LONGER.

89
00:03:43,083 --> 00:03:45,709
IT'S TIME WE TAKE BACK
WHAT IS OURS!

90
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:48,000
IT'S TIME TO TAKE BACK
OUR CITY!

91
00:03:48,041 --> 00:03:49,500
[all cheer]

92
00:03:59,917 --> 00:04:01,375

[indistinct chatter]

95
00:04:11,542 --> 00:04:14,000
- SAY "NUKTUK."

[cheers and applause]

97
00:04:16,208 --> 00:04:17,875

THE SWEETHEARTS
OF THE BIG SCREEN,

99
00:04:19,834 --> 00:04:22,792
AND REPUBLIC CITY'S
MOST FAMOUS COUPLE,

100
00:04:22,834 --> 00:04:25,375
BOLIN AND GINGER.

101
00:04:25,417 --> 00:04:27,709
[cheers and applause]
- LET ME GET A PICTURE.

102
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:30,125
- WOW, THAT WAS FUN.

103
00:04:30,166 --> 00:04:31,542
AND DID YOU HEAR
WHAT SHIRO SAID?

104
00:04:31,583 --> 00:04:34,041
WE'RE REPUBLIC CITY'S
MOST FAMOUS COUPLE.

105
00:04:34,083 --> 00:04:35,667
- BOLIN, YOU'RE A DOLL,

106
00:04:35,709 --> 00:04:38,583
BUT YOU'RE AS DUMB
AS THE ROCKS YOU BEND.

107
00:04:38,625 --> 00:04:40,542
WE ARE NOT A COUPLE.

108
00:04:40,583 --> 00:04:42,458
- THAT'S NOT WHAT SHIRO SAID.

109
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:48,375
- STOP STUFFING YOUR MOUSTACHES
WITH VARRI-CAKES

110
00:04:48,417 --> 00:04:49,709
AND GET TO YOUR POST!

111
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:51,250
- YOU GOT IT, BOSS.

112
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:53,458
- YOU TWO ARE THE PINNACLE
OF REFINEMENT.

113
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,500
- THIS STAR-STUDDED EVENT
JUST KEEPS GETTING

114
00:04:55,542 --> 00:04:57,417
STAR-STUDDIER, FOLKS.

MWAH!
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

121
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:13,208
NO EXPENSE HAS BEEN SPARED.

122
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:15,542
I BROUGHT IN THE FINEST
ENTERTAINERS FROM BA SING SE

123
00:05:15,583 --> 00:05:17,000
AND THE BEST FOOD
FROM AROUND THE WORLD.

124
00:05:17,041 --> 00:05:18,875
HECK, I EVEN
HAD THIS RED CARPET

125
00:05:18,917 --> 00:05:20,625
IMPORTED
FROM THE FIRE NATION.

126
00:05:20,667 --> 00:05:23,709
THEY MAKE THE BEST RED STUFF
OVER THERE.

127
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:25,750
FACT! ALL RIGHT, PICTURE TIME!

128
00:05:28,417 --> 00:05:30,250
- VARRICK, YOU DIDN'T
HAVE TO DO ALL THIS FOR US.

129
00:05:30,291 --> 00:05:32,208
- I WANTED TO.

130
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:35,000
MR. PRESIDENT,
I TOOK ONE LOOK AT YOUR WIFE,

131
00:05:35,041 --> 00:05:39,125
AND I KNEW THAT YOU
WERE A MAN OF EXQUISITE TASTE.

00:05:39,166 --> 00:05:42,083
AND THAT'S WHY I KNOW
YOU'RE GONNA LOVE THIS MOVER!

133
00:05:42,125 --> 00:05:44,083
- VARRICK,
I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING,

134
00:05:44,125 --> 00:05:46,834
AND I DOUBT YOUR PROPAGANDA
IS GOING TO CHANGE MY MIND

135
00:05:46,875 --> 00:05:49,000
ABOUT GOING TO WAR
WITH THE NORTHERN WATER TRIBE.

136
00:05:49,041 --> 00:05:51,250
- OH, I THINK
YOU'LL BE SURPRISED

137
00:05:51,291 --> 00:05:52,917
HOW PERSUASIVE I CAN BE.

138
00:06:07,667 --> 00:06:09,792
THANK YOU ALL
FOR COMING TO THE FINALE

OF<i> NUKTUK:</i>
<i>HERO OF THE SOUTH.</i>

140
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:15,083
YOU KNOW, WHEN I FIRST
STARTED THIS PROJECT,

141
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:17,709
THERE WERE A LOT
OF NAYSAYERS OUT THERE.

142
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:19,875
"YOU CAN'T MAKE PICTURES MOVE,"
THEY SAID.

143
00:06:19,917 --> 00:06:21,375
"YOU CAN'T TAKE
SOME KNUCKLEHEAD EARTHBENDER

144
00:06:21,417 --> 00:06:24,000
AND MAKE HIM A STAR,"
THEY SAID.

145
00:06:24,041 --> 00:06:27,041
"YOU CAN'T TEACH A POLAR BEAR
DOG TO SPEAK," THEY SAID.

146
00:06:27,083 --> 00:06:29,834
WELL, THEY'RE WRONG.

147
00:06:29,875 --> 00:06:32,458
THANKS TO THE MAGIC
OF THE MOVERS,

148
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:34,709

AND YOU'LL BE SHOCKED TO HEAR
WHAT THEY HAVE TO SAY.

150
00:06:38,959 --> 00:06:41,500
THEY SPEAK OF THE INJUSTICE
THAT'S HAPPENING

151
00:06:41,542 --> 00:06:43,792
IN THE SOUTHERN WATER TRIBE
RIGHT NOW.

152
00:06:43,834 --> 00:06:48,625
MY HOPE IS THAT THEIR WORDS
AND THIS EPIC MOVER

153
00:06:48,667 --> 00:06:51,125
WILL INSPIRE
A REAL-LIFE HERO

154
00:06:51,166 --> 00:06:55,375

172
00:07:35,375 --> 00:07:37,458
- MR. PRESIDENT, THERE'S
SOMETHING MORE IMPORTANT

173
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:38,709
THAN THE SNIFFLES

348
00:17:52,834 --> 00:17:54,166
- MWAH.

349
00:17:54,208 --> 00:17:56,417
MAKO,
I MISSED YOU SO MUCH.

350
00:17:59,417 --> 00:18:01,875
- OH, YEAH, DID I FORGET
TO TELL YOU?

351
00:18:01,917 --> 00:18:03,375
KORRA'S BACK.

352
00:18:03,417 --> 00:18:07,000
- KORRA, HEY,
I MISSED YOU TOO.

353
00:18:07,041 --> 00:18:08,417
SO YOU'RE NOT
STILL MAD AT ME?

354
00:18:08,458 --> 00:18:11,250
- WHY WOULD I BE MAD?

355
00:18:11,291 --> 00:18:14,250
- WE HAD THAT FIGHT
BEFORE YOU LEFT, REMEMBER?

356
00:18:14,291 --> 00:18:17,000
- NO, NOT REALLY.

357
00:18:17,041 --> 00:18:19,083
I GOT ATTACKED
BY A DARK SPIRIT,

358
00:18:19,125 --> 00:18:20,959
AND I LOST MY MEMORY
FOR A LITTLE WHILE.

359
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,583
MAYBE IT HASN'T
ALL COME BACK YET.

360
00:18:23,625 --> 00:18:24,959
WAS IT A BAD FIGHT?

361
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,917
- UH...

362
00:18:30,417 --> 00:18:31,875
MM...NO.

363
00:18:31,917 --> 00:18:34,709
NO, IT--
IT WASN'T THAT BAD.

364
00:18:37,083 --> 00:18:39,375
- [sucks air through teeth]

365
00:18:39,417 --> 00:18:41,625
- KORRA, WE DON'T
HAVE MUCH TIME.

366
00:18:41,667 --> 00:18:44,333
WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT
HOW TO DEAL WITH UNALAQ.

367
00:18:44,375 --> 00:18:47,417
- I THINK I KNOW
JUST THE MAN TO TALK TO.

368
00:18:47,458 --> 00:18:49,250
[festive music playing]

369
00:18:49,291 --> 00:18:52,500
- GUYS, HEY!
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

370
00:18:52,542 --> 00:18:54,041
VARRICK INDUSTRIES
BUILT THIS PRISON,

371
00:18:54,083 --> 00:18:56,291
AND I HAD THIS CELL
MADE SPECIAL.

372
00:18:56,333 --> 00:18:59,166
I HAD A FEELING
I'D END UP HERE ONE DAY.

373
00:18:59,208 --> 00:19:01,667
ZHU LI, COME ON!
WE GOT GUESTS.

374
00:19:01,709 --> 00:19:04,000
WHIP UP A POT
OF THAT GREEN TEA I LOVE.

375
00:19:04,041 --> 00:19:05,542
- YES, SIR.

376
00:19:05,583 --> 00:19:07,166
- ZHU LI'S IN PRISON
WITH YOU?

377
00:19:07,208 --> 00:19:09,083
- OF COURSE.
I DON'T GO ANYWHERE

378
00:19:09,125 --> 00:19:10,792
WITHOUT MY ASSISTANT.
DO YOU?

379
00:19:10,834 --> 00:19:12,291
- WE'RE NOT INTERESTED
IN YOUR TEA,

380
00:19:12,333 --> 00:19:13,375
AND THIS ISN'T
A FRIENDLY VISIT.

381
00:19:13,417 --> 00:19:15,125
- DON'T TELL ME YOU GUYS
ARE STILL MAD

382
00:19:15,166 --> 00:19:16,959
ABOUT EVERYTHING
THAT HAPPENED.

383
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,166
I DID SOME GOOD THINGS TOO.

384
00:19:19,208 --> 00:19:21,709
KORRA, WHO WARNED YOU
ABOUT UNALAQ?

385
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:23,041
I DID.

386
00:19:23,083 --> 00:19:25,291
BOLIN, WHO GOT YOU
INTO THE MOVERS?

387
00:19:25,333 --> 00:19:26,417
I DID.

388
00:19:26,458 --> 00:19:28,375
ASAMI, WHO SAVED
YOUR COMPANY?

389
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:29,959
I DID.

390
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,875
MAKO, WHO GOT YOU
THROWN IN JAIL?

391
00:19:31,917 --> 00:19:33,250
I DID!

392
00:19:33,291 --> 00:19:34,709
OH, YEAH, I GUESS
THAT WAS A BAD THING.

393
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:36,500
- YOU STOLE EVERYTHING
FROM ME,

394
00:19:36,542 --> 00:19:38,083
AND YOU TRIED TO KIDNAP
THE PRESIDENT.

395
00:19:38,125 --> 00:19:39,291
THOSE ARE PRETTY BAD TOO.

396
00:19:39,333 --> 00:19:41,250
- I WASN'T GOING TO HURT HIM.

397
00:19:41,291 --> 00:19:43,208
I JUST NEEDED
TO START A WAR.

398
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:44,458
WELL, A BIGGER WAR.

399
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:45,792
- WELL, WE'RE GONNA END IT.

400
00:19:45,834 --> 00:19:47,625
WHERE'S ALL THE STUFF
YOU STOLE FROM ASAMI?

401
00:19:47,667 --> 00:19:50,041
- THE FUTURE INDUSTRIES STUFF?
IT'S ON MY BATTLESHIP.

402
00:19:50,083 --> 00:19:51,792
- YOU HAVE A BATTLESHIP?

403
00:19:51,834 --> 00:19:53,333
- OF COURSE I DO!

404
00:19:53,375 --> 00:19:56,041
I BOUGHT THE FIRST ONE
THEY MADE,

405
00:19:56,083 --> 00:19:58,000
NAMED HER THE<i> ZHU LI.</i>

406
00:19:58,041 --> 00:20:01,583
- YOU NAMED YOUR BATTLESHIP
AFTER YOUR ASSISTANT?

407
00:20:01,625 --> 00:20:05,041
- YEP. THEY'RE BOTH COLD,
HEARTLESS WAR MACHINES.

408
00:20:05,083 --> 00:20:08,208
- YOUR TEA, SIR.

409
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:10,959
- LOOK, I AM TRULY SORRY
FOR THE MESS I CAUSED.

410
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:15,625
LET ME MAKE IT UP TO YOU.
TAKE<i> ZHU LI.</i>

411
00:20:15,667 --> 00:20:18,750
MY BATTLESHIP, IT'S YOURS,
AND EVERYTHING ON IT.

412
00:20:18,792 --> 00:20:20,917
- IT'S NOT THE FLEET
WE WERE LOOKING FOR,

413
00:20:20,959 --> 00:20:22,417
BUT IT'S THE NEXT BEST THING.

414
00:20:22,458 --> 00:20:23,792
- ALL RIGHT!

415
00:20:23,834 --> 00:20:25,542
TEAM AVATAR IS BACK
IN BUSINESS!

416
00:20:25,583 --> 00:20:26,500
[all laugh]

417
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:37,959
- IT'S OKAY.
WE'RE GONNA STOP UNALAQ

418
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,500
AND GET JINORA BACK.

419
00:20:39,542 --> 00:20:43,333
- I HOPE MY DAD'S ALL RIGHT.

420
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:44,542
- I'M SURE HE'S FINE.

421
00:20:47,875 --> 00:20:49,333
- [straining]

422
00:21:01,417 --> 00:21:02,917
GET THE MEN AND FALL BACK.

423
00:21:02,959 --> 00:21:05,834
- WHAT ABOUT YOU?

424
00:21:10,208 --> 00:21:12,667
- I'M GOING TO END THIS
RIGHT NOW.

425
00:21:12,709 --> 00:21:14,792
GO!

426
00:21:14,834 --> 00:21:18,125
[cries out]

427
00:21:25,291 --> 00:21:28,250
- HELLO, TONRAQ.
LOOKING FOR ME?

428
00:21:32,125 --> 00:21:34,375
- [groans]

429
00:21:38,959 --> 00:21:41,834
- BROTHER,
I'M TOO STRONG FOR YOU.

430
00:21:41,875 --> 00:21:44,500
- YOU'RE NO BROTHER OF MINE.
YOU BETRAYED ME.

431
00:21:44,542 --> 00:21:46,000
YOU HAD ME BANISHED.

432
00:21:46,041 --> 00:21:49,834
- YES, I DID.

433
00:21:49,875 --> 00:21:51,625
- [crying out]

434
00:21:51,667 --> 00:21:54,250
[groans]

435
00:21:54,291 --> 00:21:57,083
- STOP!
HE'S MINE.

436
00:21:58,709 --> 00:22:00,625
- YOU ARE NOT
THE TRUE CHIEF.

437
00:22:00,667 --> 00:22:04,083
- I AM.
AND YOU WILL BOW TO ME.

438
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:10,333
- [groans]

439
00:22:37,625 --> 00:22:39,542
[grunts]

440
00:23:06,792 --> 00:23:07,750
[groans]

441
00:23:07,792 --> 00:23:09,417
- NOW THAT I'VE DEFEATED YOU,

442
00:23:09,458 --> 00:23:13,166
YOUR DAUGHTER IS NEXT.
