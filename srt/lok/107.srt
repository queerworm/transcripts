1
00:00:01,334 --> 00:00:02,584
Earth.

2
00:00:03,211 --> 00:00:04,294
Fire.

3
00:00:04,963 --> 00:00:06,213
Air.

4
00:00:06,715 --> 00:00:08,132
Water.

5
00:00:08,967 --> 00:00:12,970
Only the Avatar can master
all four elements

6
00:00:12,971 --> 00:00:14,972
and bring baIance to the world.

7
00:00:21,855 --> 00:00:24,314
Although the Hundred Year War
has long passed,

8
00:00:24,399 --> 00:00:26,734
we are not living in a time of peace.

9
00:00:27,068 --> 00:00:30,320
These revolutionaries,
who caII themseIves EquaIists,

10
00:00:30,864 --> 00:00:33,490
are not interested in equaIity at aII.

11
00:00:33,825 --> 00:00:36,702
Theyjust want to wage war
against benders.

12
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:39,997
Chief Beifong was supposed
to protect Republic City,

13
00:00:39,998 --> 00:00:43,208
but she was powerless to stop
Amon's attack on the arena.

14
00:00:44,002 --> 00:00:45,627
She has failed us all.

15
00:00:45,712 --> 00:00:48,172
lf we are to survive these dire times,

16
00:00:48,256 --> 00:00:51,133
our law enforcement
needs new leadership.

17
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:09,568
l still can't believe
they're shutting this place down.

18
00:01:09,652 --> 00:01:12,780
Yeah, we had some good memories
here, didn't we?

19
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:14,406
Guys, great news!

20
00:01:14,491 --> 00:01:16,033
You don't have to go back
on the streets.

21
00:01:16,117 --> 00:01:18,660
l talked to Tenzin
and made all the arrangements.

22
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:21,038
You can come live
on Air Temple lsland with me.

23
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:23,290
We'd love to, but...

24
00:01:23,374 --> 00:01:27,044
Asami already invited us
to live in her dad's giant mansion!

25
00:01:28,046 --> 00:01:32,424
From here on out,
it's gonna be the lap of luxury for us!

26
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:34,468
Hey, Korra!

27
00:01:34,552 --> 00:01:36,178
l was hoping you'd stop by.

28
00:01:36,471 --> 00:01:37,930
l was just leaving.

29
00:01:38,014 --> 00:01:41,433
So, l guess l'll see you guys around...
Sometime.

30
00:01:41,518 --> 00:01:42,684
Why not tomorrow?

31
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:44,561
l'd love to have you
come visit the estate.

32
00:01:44,646 --> 00:01:48,065
l don't know.
l have some Avatar stuff to do.

33
00:01:48,358 --> 00:01:49,691
Come on, Korra!

34
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:54,071
We all deserve a little rest
and relaxation after all this craziness.

35
00:01:54,072 --> 00:01:57,324
We can swim in Asami's pool.
lt'll be fun.

36
00:01:59,244 --> 00:02:00,786
All right, Pabu.

37
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:03,080
Great, we'll see you tomorrow.

38
00:02:24,561 --> 00:02:26,436
Looks like our intel was good.

39
00:02:26,521 --> 00:02:27,521
There's enough evidence here

40
00:02:27,605 --> 00:02:30,107
to bury Cabbage Corp for an eternity.

41
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:42,995
This is an outrage!

42
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:44,288
l'm innocent!

43
00:02:44,372 --> 00:02:46,290
Yeah, yeah, that's what they all say.

44
00:02:46,374 --> 00:02:49,751
ls it true that Cabbage Corp
is conspiring with the Equalists?

45
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:53,881
The evidence points in that direction,
but the investigation is ongoing.

46
00:02:53,965 --> 00:02:55,132
For the time being,

47
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:59,887
we have frozen Mr. Gan-Lan's assets
and are closing Cabbage Corp.

48
00:03:00,054 --> 00:03:03,348
No! Not my Cabbage Corp!

49
00:03:10,815 --> 00:03:12,232
Hey, Korra.

50
00:03:14,152 --> 00:03:15,152
Tahno?

51
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:22,159
Listen,
l know we're not exactly best friends,

52
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:24,161
but l'm sorry Amon took your bending.

53
00:03:24,245 --> 00:03:27,080
l've been to the best healers in the city.

54
00:03:27,165 --> 00:03:30,334
Whatever Amon did to me,
it's permanent.

55
00:03:33,796 --> 00:03:35,464
You gotta get him for me.

56
00:03:36,758 --> 00:03:38,091
Mr. Sato,

57
00:03:38,176 --> 00:03:41,845
if you remember anything else about
what you saw during Amon's attack,

58
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:43,138
be sure to let us know.

59
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:45,349
l'm happy to help any way l can.

60
00:03:45,433 --> 00:03:48,143
l want these Equalists to pay
for what they've done.

61
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:52,189
We're ready for you now.

62
00:03:57,195 --> 00:04:00,197
See you around, Avatar.

63
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:17,214
Earthbending bomb!

64
00:04:19,008 --> 00:04:21,718
Avatar Korra has arrived.

65
00:04:21,803 --> 00:04:23,470
-Hey, Korra!
-Glad you made it!

66
00:04:23,554 --> 00:04:25,847
Welcome to paradise.

67
00:04:26,724 --> 00:04:28,850
Looks like you guys settled right in.

68
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:33,230
Pretty much. Except someone forgot
to ask her father if we could stay here.

69
00:04:33,231 --> 00:04:35,732
Yeah, but l smoothed it over with him.

70
00:04:35,817 --> 00:04:38,652
lt's easier to ask for forgiveness
than permission.

71
00:04:39,404 --> 00:04:42,531
This is the greatest place in the world!
Watch this, watch this.

72
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:44,366
Fetch me my towel, good sir!

73
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:47,077
Yes, Master Bolin.

74
00:04:47,203 --> 00:04:48,996
"Master Bolin."

75
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:50,872
l love this guy!

76
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:51,957
Now, pat me dry.

77
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:53,417
As you wish.

78
00:04:56,087 --> 00:04:57,379
Don't forget Master Pabu.

79
00:04:57,463 --> 00:04:59,256
Wouldn't dream of it, sir.

80
00:05:06,723 --> 00:05:09,266
So, what do you have planned
for us today?

81
00:05:09,267 --> 00:05:12,269
Let me guess. Shopping? Makeovers?

82
00:05:14,105 --> 00:05:15,355
l vote makeovers!

83
00:05:16,274 --> 00:05:19,401
l have something
a little more exciting in mind.

84
00:05:27,618 --> 00:05:29,161
Pretty cool, huh?

85
00:05:29,245 --> 00:05:31,288
Way cooler than a makeover.

86
00:05:31,289 --> 00:05:34,624
This is where Future lndustries
test drives their Sato-mobiles.

87
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:36,209
Ever been behind the wheel?

88
00:05:36,294 --> 00:05:38,587
The only thing l know how to drive
is a polar bear-dog.

89
00:05:38,671 --> 00:05:40,589
You want me to take you for a spin?

90
00:05:40,673 --> 00:05:41,923
Let's do it.

91
00:06:07,325 --> 00:06:08,825
Yeah!

92
00:06:44,445 --> 00:06:45,612
That was amazing!

93
00:06:45,696 --> 00:06:47,114
l didn't think we'd make it.

94
00:06:47,198 --> 00:06:49,658
Well, you can't be afraid
to mix it up sometimes.

95
00:06:49,742 --> 00:06:52,369
l gotta admit, l had you pegged wrong.

96
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:54,287
l thought you were kind of prissy.

97
00:06:54,372 --> 00:06:55,372
No offense.

98
00:06:56,124 --> 00:06:57,374
lt's all right.

99
00:06:57,375 --> 00:07:00,001
People usually assume that
l'm "Daddy's helpless little girl,"

100
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:01,753
but l can handle myself.

101
00:07:01,838 --> 00:07:04,714
l mean, l've been in self-defense
classes since l was this high.

102
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:07,342
My dad made sure
l would always be able to protect myself.

103
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:08,718
Smart guy.

104
00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:10,887
Emergency! Emergency!

105
00:07:10,972 --> 00:07:12,389
Coming through!

106
00:07:14,392 --> 00:07:16,309
ls there another bathroom l can use?

107
00:07:16,394 --> 00:07:18,270
We have a ladies' powder room
upstairs.

108
00:07:18,354 --> 00:07:20,439
First door on your right.
You can freshen up in there.

109
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:21,731
Thanks.

110
00:07:40,168 --> 00:07:42,002
No, no! l assure you,

111
00:07:42,086 --> 00:07:44,421
everything is going exactly as planned.

112
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:50,260
Yes.

113
00:07:50,344 --> 00:07:54,097
Luckily, the Cabbage Corp investigation
has bought us enough time.

114
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:59,436
Trust me, by the end of the week,
we'll be ready to strike.

115
00:08:07,445 --> 00:08:08,445
You're leaving?

116
00:08:08,446 --> 00:08:10,655
-But l thought...
-Sorry, l forgot,

117
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:13,450
l'm supposed to airsit...
l mean babybend...

118
00:08:13,451 --> 00:08:16,036
l mean babysit the Airbender kids.

119
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,454
See you later!

120
00:08:25,838 --> 00:08:29,716
So, you think Mr. Sato manufactured
those gloves for the Equalists,

121
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,468
then framed Cabbage Corp?

122
00:08:31,469 --> 00:08:34,471
That's a bold accusation.
But what proof do you have?

123
00:08:34,472 --> 00:08:38,266
Well, l don't exactly have proof,
but l know what l heard.

124
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:39,643
Sato's up to something.

125
00:08:39,727 --> 00:08:41,645
He does have the means.

126
00:08:41,979 --> 00:08:43,313
And he has a motive.

127
00:08:43,397 --> 00:08:44,481
That's right.

128
00:08:44,482 --> 00:08:46,399
A motive? What is it?

129
00:08:46,484 --> 00:08:50,529
Twelve years ago, the Agni Kai Triad
robbed Sato's mansion.

130
00:08:50,655 --> 00:08:53,490
A Firebender killed Sato's wife
during the break-in.

131
00:08:53,491 --> 00:08:54,699
That's terrible.

132
00:08:54,784 --> 00:08:56,493
lt was tragic.

133
00:08:56,494 --> 00:09:00,205
lt's possible he's been harboring
anti-bending sentiment all this time.

134
00:09:00,498 --> 00:09:03,750
Maybe we should look at Mr. Sato
a little more closely.

135
00:09:13,594 --> 00:09:14,803
What's going on?

136
00:09:14,887 --> 00:09:16,763
Why are they asking Hiroshi
more questions?

137
00:09:16,847 --> 00:09:19,224
l overheard him on the phone yesterday.

138
00:09:19,308 --> 00:09:21,434
Asami, l don't know how to tell you this,

139
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:24,437
but l think your father might be involved
with the Equalists.

140
00:09:24,522 --> 00:09:27,023
What? l don't believe this!

141
00:09:27,942 --> 00:09:29,526
You spied on Hiroshi?

142
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:31,444
What's your problem?

143
00:09:33,656 --> 00:09:37,158
Mr. Sato, we just have a few
follow-up questions for you...

144
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:38,952
My father is innocent!

145
00:09:39,036 --> 00:09:40,662
Just because we're not benders,

146
00:09:40,746 --> 00:09:43,456
doesn't mean we support
those awful Equalists!

147
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:46,543
Equalists? ls that what this is about?

148
00:09:46,544 --> 00:09:49,504
l can assure you,
l have nothing to do with those radicals.

149
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:52,007
Yeah, you don't know
what you're talking about, Korra.

150
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:53,550
l overheard you on the phone.

151
00:09:53,634 --> 00:09:56,303
You said the Cabbage Corp
investigation bought you time,

152
00:09:56,387 --> 00:09:57,846
and you're getting ready to strike.

153
00:09:57,930 --> 00:09:59,180
Explain that!

154
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:03,518
This is all just a misunderstanding

155
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:07,480
resulting from the young Avatar's
overactive imagination.

156
00:10:07,898 --> 00:10:10,567
My number one competitor
was knocked out of the game.

157
00:10:10,651 --> 00:10:12,485
lt's providing me an opportunity

158
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:15,614
to "strike" the market
with a new line of Sato-mobiles.

159
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:17,824
lt's just business.

160
00:10:17,908 --> 00:10:19,576
Nothing nefarious.

161
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:23,330
ln order to put all suspicions to rest,

162
00:10:23,414 --> 00:10:25,665
might we have a look into your factories
and warehouses?

163
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:28,918
lf you feel it's necessary,

164
00:10:29,003 --> 00:10:31,963
you are welcome to search
all of Future lndustries.

165
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:37,594
Is it possibIe the presidents of
Cabbage Corp and Future lndustries

166
00:10:37,595 --> 00:10:39,596
both have EquaIist ties?

167
00:10:39,847 --> 00:10:44,517
Or did Hiroshi Sato frame
his longtime rival, Lau Gan-Lan?

168
00:10:44,602 --> 00:10:48,563
Or did Chief Beifong
just pIain arrest the wrong man?

169
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:53,568
So far the investigation has yielded
no evidence to incriminate Sato.

170
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:01,701
l can't believe we didn't find anything.

171
00:11:01,786 --> 00:11:03,703
lt would appear Hiroshi is innocent.

172
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:06,039
Okay, you did your search.

173
00:11:06,123 --> 00:11:07,624
Now you can all leave.

174
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:14,339
So, l hope you're convinced now.

175
00:11:14,423 --> 00:11:15,548
No, l'm not.

176
00:11:15,633 --> 00:11:18,009
l don't care how cooperative
Hiroshi is being,

177
00:11:18,094 --> 00:11:19,386
l know he's lying.

178
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:21,012
Why are you doing this?

179
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:23,181
Are you that jealous of me and Asami?

180
00:11:23,265 --> 00:11:26,518
What? Don't be ridiculous.
That has nothing to do with it.

181
00:11:26,602 --> 00:11:29,729
lf you don't drop this,
consider our friendship over.

182
00:11:30,648 --> 00:11:33,775
l'm sorry.
Hiroshi is not the man you think he is.

183
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:03,680
l think you guys should hear this.

184
00:12:03,681 --> 00:12:05,223
"lf you want to find the truth,

185
00:12:05,307 --> 00:12:09,018
"meet me under the north end
of the Silk Road Bridge at midnight."

186
00:12:18,529 --> 00:12:19,529
Over here.

187
00:12:22,616 --> 00:12:26,453
Listen, l joined the Equalists
because l believed in what Amon said.

188
00:12:26,537 --> 00:12:28,997
l thought he could make life better
for us non-benders.

189
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:31,708
But l didn't sign up for this... This war.

190
00:12:31,709 --> 00:12:33,626
What do you have on Hiroshi Sato?

191
00:12:33,711 --> 00:12:36,629
He manufactured those gloves
for the Equalists.

192
00:12:36,714 --> 00:12:37,881
l knew it!

193
00:12:37,965 --> 00:12:40,633
And there are rumors he's working
on something even bigger...

194
00:12:40,718 --> 00:12:42,177
Some new kind of weapon.

195
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:45,180
We searched all of Future lndustries
and found nothing.

196
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:47,515
That's because he has a secret factory.

197
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,600
Where?

198
00:12:48,684 --> 00:12:51,144
lt's right underneath the Sato mansion.

199
00:13:06,327 --> 00:13:08,369
Raiding the Sato mansion
is a risky move

200
00:13:08,537 --> 00:13:10,538
with Tarrlok breathing down your neck.

201
00:13:10,748 --> 00:13:14,751
-lf we're wrong...
-l know, l can kiss my job goodbye.

202
00:13:14,752 --> 00:13:17,754
But protecting Republic City
is all l care about.

203
00:13:17,755 --> 00:13:20,799
We can't let Amon get his hands
on this new weapon.

204
00:13:30,851 --> 00:13:32,644
What are you doing here?

205
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:34,646
We have reason to believe
there's a factory

206
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:35,772
hidden below the mansion.

207
00:13:35,856 --> 00:13:39,776
l think l would have noticed if there
were a factory underneath my house.

208
00:13:39,777 --> 00:13:42,987
The lies you people come up with
just to persecute my father...

209
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:44,280
Where is your father?

210
00:13:44,365 --> 00:13:47,075
ln his workshop, behind the house.

211
00:13:59,129 --> 00:14:00,129
Dad?

212
00:14:00,422 --> 00:14:01,798
Hello?

213
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,676
Chief, the estate has been secured.

214
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:06,636
No one's left the workshop
since we arrived.

215
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,972
Perhaps we just couldn't
see him leaving.

216
00:14:20,192 --> 00:14:23,444
There's a tunnel beneath the workshop,
running deep into the mountainside.

217
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:25,822
What? There's no tunnel.

218
00:14:37,585 --> 00:14:40,837
Do you think your dad knows
about this tunnel?

219
00:14:40,838 --> 00:14:42,630
l don't understand.

220
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:44,340
There must be an explanation.

221
00:14:44,425 --> 00:14:47,760
Maybe you don't know everything
about your father.

222
00:14:47,845 --> 00:14:48,845
l'm sorry.

223
00:14:48,971 --> 00:14:50,930
Officers, into the tunnel.

224
00:14:51,015 --> 00:14:52,432
Be cautious.

225
00:14:54,852 --> 00:14:56,144
You three stay up here.

226
00:14:56,228 --> 00:14:58,730
Officer Song, keep an eye on them.

227
00:15:36,852 --> 00:15:39,145
Not your average backyard workshop.

228
00:15:42,733 --> 00:15:45,652
And l'm guessing
those are the new weapons.

229
00:15:54,995 --> 00:15:57,246
Hiroshi was lying, all right.
But where is he?

230
00:16:00,918 --> 00:16:01,918
What was that?

231
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:03,920
We need to get down there
and see what's going on.

232
00:16:03,921 --> 00:16:05,088
Absolutely not.

233
00:16:05,172 --> 00:16:07,298
You're staying put
until the Chief comes back.

234
00:16:09,134 --> 00:16:10,927
All right, we'll stay put.

235
00:16:10,928 --> 00:16:12,804
But can we wait outside or something?

236
00:16:12,888 --> 00:16:14,389
lt's so dusty in this workshop.

237
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:16,599
No. We're waiting right here.

238
00:16:16,684 --> 00:16:19,936
Okay, but don't blame me
if l start snee...

239
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:23,940
lf l start snee...

240
00:16:24,024 --> 00:16:25,441
What's your problem, bub?

241
00:16:25,526 --> 00:16:26,943
l'm about to...

242
00:16:33,367 --> 00:16:34,409
Sorry, pal.

243
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:36,202
We know you were just doing yourjob.

244
00:16:36,286 --> 00:16:39,414
Yeah, just stay put
until the Chief comes back.

245
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:42,041
That sounds very familiar, doesn't it?
Why? Because you said it.

246
00:16:43,085 --> 00:16:45,962
Asami, you should stay here.
We'll check it out.

247
00:16:45,963 --> 00:16:47,964
l have to find out the truth
about my father.

248
00:16:48,048 --> 00:16:49,257
l understand.

249
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:52,343
That's why l'm going down
to find out for you.

250
00:16:52,428 --> 00:16:53,428
Please.

251
00:16:54,138 --> 00:16:55,596
All right.

252
00:16:59,601 --> 00:17:00,977
Be careful.

253
00:17:06,275 --> 00:17:10,695
I'm afraid you won't be abIe
to metalbend that wall, Chief Beifong.

254
00:17:10,779 --> 00:17:11,988
It's soIid pIatinum.

255
00:17:16,493 --> 00:17:18,995
My mecha-tanks are pIatinum as weII.

256
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:23,291
Not even your renowned mother
could bend a metal so pure.

257
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:27,545
Hiroshi, l knew you were
a lying, no-good Equalist!

258
00:17:27,629 --> 00:17:28,880
Come out here and...

259
00:17:28,964 --> 00:17:32,341
And do what, young Avatar?
Face the wrath of your bending?

260
00:17:32,426 --> 00:17:35,595
No, I think I'II fight from inside here

261
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:39,682
where my odds are a IittIe more...
EquaI.

262
00:17:39,767 --> 00:17:42,935
That source was a setup.
You lured us down here!

263
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:45,021
Guilty as charged.

264
00:18:52,756 --> 00:18:54,507
Korra!

265
00:19:32,129 --> 00:19:35,298
Well, l'd say that was
a near-flawless test run.

266
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:39,552
Load everyone into the transports
and deliver them to Amon.

267
00:19:49,229 --> 00:19:50,313
No.

268
00:19:53,525 --> 00:19:54,692
Korra was right.

269
00:19:54,776 --> 00:19:56,360
We gotta do something, quick!

270
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:14,128
Not so fast, boys.

271
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:18,216
Hello, Mr. Sato.

272
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:22,094
Wow, what a really swell, scary factory

273
00:20:22,179 --> 00:20:23,888
you have here
under your giant mansion.

274
00:20:23,972 --> 00:20:28,100
Sponsoring our team,
supporting the Avatar...

275
00:20:28,185 --> 00:20:29,769
lt was all just a big cover.

276
00:20:29,853 --> 00:20:32,980
Yes, and the most difficult part

277
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:35,566
was watching my daughter
traipse around

278
00:20:35,651 --> 00:20:38,986
with a firebending street rat like you.

279
00:20:43,325 --> 00:20:44,700
Dad, stop!

280
00:20:47,496 --> 00:20:48,496
Why?

281
00:20:49,206 --> 00:20:51,374
Sweetie,

282
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:54,377
l wanted to keep you out of this
for as long as l could,

283
00:20:54,461 --> 00:20:56,671
but now that you know the truth,

284
00:20:56,755 --> 00:20:59,173
please forgive me.

285
00:21:00,133 --> 00:21:01,133
These people...

286
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:04,095
These benders...

287
00:21:04,179 --> 00:21:05,596
They took away your mother,

288
00:21:05,681 --> 00:21:07,473
the love of my life.

289
00:21:07,557 --> 00:21:09,350
They've ruined the world!

290
00:21:09,726 --> 00:21:13,896
But with Amon, we can fix it
and build a perfect world together.

291
00:21:14,189 --> 00:21:17,566
We can help people like us,
everywhere!

292
00:21:17,651 --> 00:21:19,235
Join me, Asami.

293
00:21:44,594 --> 00:21:45,594
No.

294
00:21:46,263 --> 00:21:47,596
l love you, Dad.

295
00:21:59,276 --> 00:22:00,276
Let's get out of here!

296
00:22:18,754 --> 00:22:22,423
My Metalbenders are on their way
to Amon, and it's all my fault.

297
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:26,761
Tarrlok's right, l failed as chief.

298
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:29,430
First thing in the morning,
l'm handing in my resignation.

299
00:22:29,514 --> 00:22:31,515
No! You can't give up like this.

300
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,184
l'm not giving up.

301
00:22:33,268 --> 00:22:36,312
l'm going to find my officers
and take Amon down.

302
00:22:36,646 --> 00:22:40,691
But l'm going to do it my way,
outside the law.

303
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:45,321
l'm sorry l didn't believe you.

304
00:22:45,322 --> 00:22:49,241
But Asami's dad being an Equalist
is not an easy thing to believe.

305
00:22:49,326 --> 00:22:51,535
-Even now.
-l know.

306
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:54,330
l'm sorry this whole thing happened.

307
00:22:54,331 --> 00:22:57,500
So, does your offer to live
at the Air Temple still stand?

308
00:22:57,834 --> 00:22:59,585
Of course it does.

309
00:22:59,669 --> 00:23:01,295
And Asami's welcome, too.

310
00:23:01,588 --> 00:23:03,339
Thank you so much.

311
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:05,633
After everything she's been through,

312
00:23:05,717 --> 00:23:07,593
she's going to need you, Mako.
