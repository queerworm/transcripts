00:09:29,291 --> 00:09:32,125
- YOU SPIED ON HIROSHI?

177
00:09:32,166 --> 00:09:36,041
WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM?

178
00:09:36,083 --> 00:09:39,625
- MR. SATO, WE JUST HAVE A FEW
FOLLOW-UP QUESTIONS FOR YOU.

179
00:09:39,667 --> 00:09:41,500
- MY FATHER IS INNOCENT.

180
00:09:41,542 --> 00:09:43,667
JUST BECAUSE WE'RE NOT
BENDERS DOESN'T MEAN

181
00:09:43,709 --> 00:09:45,875
WE SUPPORT
THOSE AWFUL EQUALISTS.

182
00:09:45,917 --> 00:09:47,041
- EQUALISTS?

183
00:09:47,083 --> 00:09:48,875
IS THAT WHAT THIS IS ABOUT?

184
00:09:48,917 --> 00:09:52,000
I CAN ASSURE YOU, I HAVE NOTHING
TO DO WITH THOSE RADICALS.

185
00:09:52,041 --> 00:09:54,208
- YEAH, YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT, KORRA.

186
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:56,125
- I OVERHEARD YOU ON THE PHONE.

187
00:09:56,166 --> 00:09:58,667
YOU SAID THE CABBAGE CORP
INVESTIGATION BOUGHT YOU TIME,

188
00:09:58,709 --> 00:10:00,250
AND YOU'RE GETTING
READY TO STRIKE.

189
00:10:00,291 --> 00:10:01,333
EXPLAIN THAT.

190
00:10:01,375 --> 00:10:03,917
- [chuckles]

191
00:10:03,959 --> 00:10:05,917
THIS IS ALL JUST
A MISUNDERSTANDING,

192
00:10:05,959 --> 00:10:09,875
RESULTING FROM A YOUNG AVATAR'S
OVER-ACTIVE IMAGINATION.

193
00:10:09,917 --> 00:10:13,125
MY NUMBER ONE COMPETITOR
WAS KNOCKED OUT OF THE GAME.

194
00:10:13,166 --> 00:10:14,792
IT'S PROVIDING ME AN OPPORTUNITY

195
00:10:14,834 --> 00:10:18,041
TO STRIKE THE MARKET WITH
A NEW LINE OF SATO-MOBILES.

196
00:10:18,083 --> 00:10:21,750
IT'S JUST BUSINESS,
NOTHING NEFARIOUS.

197
00:10:23,375 --> 00:10:25,709
- IN ORDER TO PUT ALL
SUSPICIONS TO REST,

198
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:27,792
MIGHT WE HAVE A LOOK INTO YOUR
FACTORIES AND WAREHOUSES?

199
00:10:27,834 --> 00:10:29,959
- [sighs]

200
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,583
- IF YOU FEEL IT'S NECESSARY,

201
00:10:31,625 --> 00:10:36,458
YOU'RE WELCOME TO SEARCH
ALL OF FUTURE INDUSTRIES.

202
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:38,709
- IS IT POSSIBLE PRESIDENTS
OF CABBAGE CORP

203
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:41,750
AND FUTURE INDUSTRIES
BOTH HAVE EQUALIST TIES?

204
00:10:41,792 --> 00:10:46,792
OR DID HIROSHI SATO FRAME HIS
LONG-TIME RIVAL, LAU GAN-LAN?

205
00:10:46,834 --> 00:10:51,000
OR DID CHIEF BEIFONG JUST PLAIN
ARREST THE WRONG MAN?

206
00:10:51,041 --> 00:10:52,959
SO FAR, THE INVESTIGATION
HAS YIELDED

207
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,667
NO EVIDENCE TO INCRIMINATE SATO.

208
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,166
- I CAN'T BELIEVE
WE DIDN'T FIND ANYTHING.

209
00:11:04,208 --> 00:11:06,083
- IT WOULD APPEAR
HIROSHI IS INNOCENT.

210
00:11:06,125 --> 00:11:08,291
- OKAY, YOU DID YOUR SEARCH.

211
00:11:08,333 --> 00:11:09,750
NOW YOU CAN ALL LEAVE.

212
00:11:09,792 --> 00:11:11,709
- HMM.

213
00:11:14,375 --> 00:11:15,375
- SO?

214
00:11:15,417 --> 00:11:16,583
I HOPE YOU'RE CONVINCED NOW.

215
00:11:16,625 --> 00:11:18,125
- NO, I'M NOT.

216
00:11:18,166 --> 00:11:20,458
I DON'T CARE HOW COOPERATIVE
HIROSHI IS BEING.

217
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:21,750
I KNOW HE'S LYING.

218
00:11:21,792 --> 00:11:23,542
- WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS?

219
00:11:23,583 --> 00:11:25,000
ARE YOU THAT JEALOUS
OF ME AND ASAMI?

220
00:11:25,041 --> 00:11:26,291
- [gasps]
WHAT?!

221
00:11:26,333 --> 00:11:27,291
DON'T BE RIDICULOUS.

222
00:11:27,333 --> 00:11:28,667
THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH IT.

223
00:11:28,709 --> 00:11:30,333
- IF YOU DON'T DROP THIS,

224
00:11:30,375 --> 00:11:31,834
CONSIDER OUR FRIENDSHIP OVER.

225
00:11:31,875 --> 00:11:34,208
- I'M SORRY.

226
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:35,959
HIROSHI IS NOT THE MAN
YOU THINK HE IS.

227
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,375
- HMPH.

228
00:12:02,458 --> 00:12:06,166
- I THINK YOU GUYS
SHOULD HEAR THIS.

229
00:12:06,208 --> 00:12:07,458
"IF YOU WANT TO FIND THE TRUTH,

230
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:09,291
"MEET ME UNDER THE NORTH END

231
00:12:09,333 --> 00:12:11,709
OF THE SILK ROAD BRIDGE
AT MIDNIGHT."

232
00:12:20,667 --> 00:12:21,959
- PSST, OVER HERE.

233
00:12:25,291 --> 00:12:26,917
LISTEN, I JOINED THE EQUALISTS

234
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:28,917
BECAUSE I BELIEVED
IN WHAT AMON SAID.

235
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:31,375
I THOUGHT HE COULD MAKE LIFE
BETTER FOR US NON-BENDERS.

236
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:34,041
BUT I DIDN'T SIGN UP
FOR THIS--THIS WAR.

237
00:12:34,083 --> 00:12:35,834
- WHAT DO YOU HAVE
ON HIROSHI SATO?

238
00:12:35,875 --> 00:12:38,834
- HE MANUFACTURED THOSE GLOVES
FOR THE EQUALISTS.

239
00:12:38,875 --> 00:12:40,458
- I KNEW IT!

240
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:42,041
- AND THERE ARE RUMORS
HE'S WORKING ON SOMETHING

241
00:12:42,083 --> 00:12:44,917
EVEN BIGGER;
SOME NEW KIND OF WEAPON.

242
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:47,583
- WE SEARCHED ALL OF FUTURE
INDUSTRIES AND FOUND NOTHING.

243
00:12:47,625 --> 00:12:49,750
- THAT'S BECAUSE
HE HAS A SECRET FACTORY.

244
00:12:49,792 --> 00:12:51,125
- WHERE?

245
00:12:51,166 --> 00:12:53,208
- IT'S RIGHT UNDERNEATH
THE SATO MANSION.

246
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:54,166
[all gasp]

247
00:13:02,083 --> 00:13:04,542
- [exhales]

248
00:13:04,583 --> 00:13:06,500
- RAIDING THE SATO MANSION
IS A RISKY

249
00:13:06,542 --> 00:13:08,375
MOVE WITH TARRLOK
BREATHING DOWN YOUR NECK.

250
00:13:08,417 --> 00:13:10,667
IF WE'RE WRONG--
- I KNOW.

251
00:13:10,709 --> 00:13:12,667
I CAN KISS MY JOB GOOD-BYE.

252
00:13:12,709 --> 00:13:15,959
BUT PROTECTING REPUBLIC CITY
IS ALL I CARE ABOUT.

253
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,417
WE CAN'T LET AMON GET HIS HANDS
ON THIS NEW WEAPON.

254
00:13:23,166 --> 00:13:27,792
[record music plays]
- [gulps]

255
00:13:27,834 --> 00:13:30,417
[yelps]
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?!

256
00:13:30,458 --> 00:13:31,917
- WE HAVE REASON TO BELIEVE

257
00:13:31,959 --> 00:13:33,709
THERE'S A FACTORY HIDDEN BELOW
THE MANSION.

258
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:35,333
- I THINK I WOULD HAVE NOTICED

259
00:13:35,375 --> 00:13:37,917
IF THERE WERE A FACTORY
UNDERNEATH MY HOUSE.

260
00:13:37,959 --> 00:13:41,041
THE LIES YOU PEOPLE COME UP WITH
JUST TO PERSECUTE MY FATHER...

261
00:13:41,083 --> 00:13:42,417
- WHERE IS YOUR FATHER?

262
00:13:42,458 --> 00:13:44,792
- IN HIS WORKSHOP,
BEHIND THE HOUSE.

263
00:13:56,667 --> 00:13:57,792
DAD?

264
00:13:57,834 --> 00:14:00,542
HELLO?

265
00:14:00,583 --> 00:14:02,667
- CHIEF, THE ESTATE'S
BEEN SECURED.

266
00:14:02,709 --> 00:14:04,750
NO ONE HAS LEFT THE WORKSHOP
SINCE WE ARRIVED.

267
00:14:04,792 --> 00:14:07,208
- PERHAPS WE JUST COULDN'T SEE
HIM LEAVING.

268
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,667
THERE'S A TUNNEL
BENEATH THE WORKSHOP

269
00:14:19,709 --> 00:14:21,333
RUNNING DEEP INTO
THE MOUNTAINSIDE.

270
00:14:21,375 --> 00:14:24,291
- WHAT? THERE'S NO TUNNEL.

271
00:14:33,917 --> 00:14:35,709
- [gasps]

272
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:38,709
DO YOU THINK YOUR DAD
KNOWS ABOUT THIS TUNNEL?

273
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:40,333
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

274
00:14:40,375 --> 00:14:42,500
THERE MUST BE AN EXPLANATION.

275
00:14:42,542 --> 00:14:45,625
- MAYBE YOU DON'T KNOW
EVERYTHING ABOUT YOUR FATHER.

276
00:14:45,667 --> 00:14:46,917
I'M SORRY.

277
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:48,917
- OFFICERS, INTO THE TUNNEL.

278
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:50,625
BE CAUTIOUS.

279
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:54,291
UH-UH, YOU THREE STAY UP HERE.

280
00:14:54,333 --> 00:14:57,041
OFFICER SONG,
KEEP AN EYE ON THEM.

281
00:15:34,709 --> 00:15:37,375
NOT YOUR AVERAGE
BACKYARD WORKSHOP.

282
00:15:40,333 --> 00:15:44,041
- AND I'M GUESSING THOSE
ARE THE NEW WEAPONS.

283
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:55,417
- HIROSHI WAS LYING ALL RIGHT,
BUT WHERE IS HE?

284
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:01,000
- WHAT WAS THAT?
- WE NEED TO GET DOWN THERE

285
00:16:01,041 --> 00:16:02,000
AND SEE WHAT'S GOING ON.

286
00:16:02,041 --> 00:16:03,166
- ABSOLUTELY NOT.

287
00:16:03,208 --> 00:16:04,083
YOU'RE STAYING PUT

288
00:16:04,125 --> 00:16:07,375
UNTIL THE CHIEF COMES BACK.

289
00:16:07,417 --> 00:16:08,959
- ALL RIGHT, WE'LL STAY PUT.

290
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,500
BUT CAN WE WAIT
OUTSIDE OR SOMETHING?

291
00:16:10,542 --> 00:16:12,333
IT'S SO DUSTY IN THIS WORKSHOP.

292
00:16:12,375 --> 00:16:14,709
- NO, WE'RE WAITING RIGHT HERE.

293
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:18,041
- OKAY, BUT DON'T BLAME ME
IF I START SN-SNEE...

294
00:16:18,083 --> 00:16:20,542
IF I START SN-SN-SNEE...

295
00:16:20,583 --> 00:16:22,375
SN-SNEEZE.

296
00:16:22,417 --> 00:16:23,500
- WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM, BUB?

297
00:16:23,542 --> 00:16:26,208
- I'M ABOUT TO--AH-CHOO!
- [yelps]

298
00:16:28,041 --> 00:16:29,125
AGH!

299
00:16:29,166 --> 00:16:30,917
[muffled yells]

300
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:32,375
- SORRY, PAL.

301
00:16:32,417 --> 00:16:34,333
WE KNOW YOU WERE
JUST DOING YOUR JOB.

302
00:16:34,375 --> 00:16:37,625
- YEAH, JUST STAY PUT
UNTIL THE CHIEF COMES BACK.

303
00:16:37,667 --> 00:16:38,709
THAT SOUNDS VERY FAMILIAR,
DOESN'T IT?

304
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:40,125
WHY? BECAUSE YOU SAID IT.

305
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:42,834
- ASAMI, YOU SHOULD STAY HERE.

306
00:16:42,875 --> 00:16:44,125
WE'LL CHECK IT OUT.

307
00:16:44,166 --> 00:16:45,834
- I HAVE TO FIND OUT THE TRUTH
ABOUT MY FATHER.

308
00:16:45,875 --> 00:16:47,375
- I UNDERSTAND.

309
00:16:47,417 --> 00:16:48,792
THAT'S WHY I'M GOING DOWN.

310
00:16:48,834 --> 00:16:50,083
TO FIND OUT FOR YOU.

311
00:16:50,125 --> 00:16:51,250
PLEASE.

312
00:16:51,291 --> 00:16:53,208
- ALL RIGHT.

313
00:16:56,792 --> 00:16:58,542
BE CAREFUL.

314
00:17:03,166 --> 00:17:04,542
- [grunts]

315
00:17:04,583 --> 00:17:06,000
- I'M AFRAID YOU WON'T BE ABLE

316
00:17:06,041 --> 00:17:08,625
TO METALBEND THAT WALL,
CHIEF BEIFONG.

317
00:17:08,667 --> 00:17:11,333
IT'S SOLID PLATINUM.

318
00:17:14,458 --> 00:17:17,166
MY MECHA-TANKS ARE
PLATINUM AS WELL.

319
00:17:17,208 --> 00:17:21,500
NOT EVEN YOUR RENOWNED MOTHER
COULD BEND A METAL SO PURE.

320
00:17:21,542 --> 00:17:25,583
- HIROSHI, I KNEW YOU WERE A
LYING, NO-GOOD EQUALIST.

321
00:17:25,625 --> 00:17:26,917
COME OUT HERE AND--

322
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:28,208
- AND DO WHAT, YOUNG AVATAR?

323
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:30,500
FACE THE WRATH
OF YOUR BENDING?

324
00:17:30,542 --> 00:17:31,834
NO.

325
00:17:31,875 --> 00:17:33,875
I THINK I'LL FIGHT
FROM INSIDE HERE,

326
00:17:33,917 --> 00:17:37,709
WHERE MY ODDS ARE A LITTLE
MORE...EQUAL.

327
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:39,458
- THAT SOURCE WAS A SETUP.

328
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:40,917
YOU LURED US DOWN HERE.

329
00:17:40,959 --> 00:17:42,667
- GUILTY AS CHARGED.

330
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:23,917
[all grunt and strain]

331
00:18:28,166 --> 00:18:29,875
[electricity crackles]

332
00:18:29,917 --> 00:18:32,834
[all scream]

333
00:18:36,208 --> 00:18:37,583
- [screams]

334
00:18:37,625 --> 00:18:39,291
[groans]

335
00:18:41,709 --> 00:18:44,041
- [grunts]

336
00:18:44,083 --> 00:18:46,041
[growls]

337
00:18:49,417 --> 00:18:50,667
- [grunts]

338
00:18:50,709 --> 00:18:51,709
OOF!

339
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:53,417
- KORRA!

340
00:19:09,834 --> 00:19:10,959
[grunts]

341
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,917
OOF!

342
00:19:29,834 --> 00:19:34,041
- WELL, I'D SAY THAT
WAS A NEAR-FLAWLESS TEST RUN.

343
00:19:34,083 --> 00:19:35,583
LOAD EVERYONE INTO
THE TRANSPORTS

344
00:19:35,625 --> 00:19:37,875
AND DELIVER THEM TO AMON.

345
00:19:46,875 --> 00:19:48,542
- OH, NO.

346
00:19:50,917 --> 00:19:52,500
- KORRA WAS RIGHT.

347
00:19:52,542 --> 00:19:55,208
WE GOTTA DO SOMETHING QUICK.

348
00:20:04,875 --> 00:20:08,000
- [grunts]

349
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:10,709
- NOT SO FAST, BOYS.

350
00:20:14,792 --> 00:20:16,208
- HELLO, MR. SATO.

351
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:17,458
WOW.

352
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:19,875
WHAT A REALLY...SWELL,
SCARY FACTORY

353
00:20:19,917 --> 00:20:21,792
YOU HAVE HERE
UNDER YOUR GIANT MANSION.

354
00:20:21,834 --> 00:20:24,083
- SPONSORING OUR TEAM.

355
00:20:24,125 --> 00:20:26,166
SUPPORTING THE AVATAR.

356
00:20:26,208 --> 00:20:27,959
IT WAS ALL JUST A BIG COVER.

357
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,709
- YES, AND THE MOST DIFFICULT
PART WAS WATCHING MY DAUGHTER

358
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:36,458
TRAIPSE AROUND WITH A
FIREBENDING STREET RAT LIKE YOU!

359
00:20:41,125 --> 00:20:43,041
- DAD, STOP!

360
00:20:45,458 --> 00:20:46,333
WHY?

361
00:20:46,375 --> 00:20:49,583
- SWEETIE...

362
00:20:49,625 --> 00:20:52,500
I WANTED TO KEEP YOU OUT OF THIS
FOR AS LONG AS I COULD,

363
00:20:52,542 --> 00:20:57,959
BUT NOW THAT YOU KNOW THE TRUTH,
PLEASE FORGIVE ME.

364
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:03,542
THESE PEOPLE, THESE...BENDERS,
THEY TOOK AWAY YOUR MOTHER,

365
00:21:03,583 --> 00:21:05,625
THE LOVE OF MY LIFE.

366
00:21:05,667 --> 00:21:07,583
THEY'VE RUINED THE WORLD.

367
00:21:07,625 --> 00:21:12,041
BUT WITH AMON, WE CAN FIX IT AND
BUILD A PERFECT WORLD TOGETHER.

368
00:21:12,083 --> 00:21:15,750
WE CAN HELP PEOPLE
LIKE US EVERYWHERE.

369
00:21:15,792 --> 00:21:17,458
JOIN ME, ASAMI.

370
00:21:42,375 --> 00:21:43,417
- NO.

371
00:21:43,458 --> 00:21:45,625
- I LOVE YOU, DAD.

372
00:21:45,667 --> 00:21:47,333
- [screams]

373
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,917
- [screams]

374
00:21:57,667 --> 00:21:59,166
- LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.

375
00:22:16,792 --> 00:22:19,166
- MY METALBENDERS ARE
ON THEIR WAY TO AMON

376
00:22:19,208 --> 00:22:20,417
AND IT'S ALL MY FAULT.

377
00:22:20,458 --> 00:22:22,333
TARRLOK'S RIGHT.

378
00:22:22,375 --> 00:22:25,083
I FAILED AS CHIEF.

379
00:22:25,125 --> 00:22:27,417
FIRST THING IN THE MORNING,
I'M HANDING IN MY RESIGNATION.

380
00:22:27,458 --> 00:22:29,500
- NO, YOU CAN'T
GIVE UP LIKE THIS.

381
00:22:29,542 --> 00:22:31,125
- I'M NOT GIVING UP.

382
00:22:31,166 --> 00:22:34,250
I'M GONNA FIND MY OFFICERS AND
TAKE AMON DOWN.

383
00:22:34,291 --> 00:22:38,291
BUT I'M GONNA DO IT MY WAY,
OUTSIDE THE LAW.

384
00:22:40,875 --> 00:22:44,417
- I'M SORRY I DIDN'T BELIEVE
YOU, BUT ASAMI'S DAD

385
00:22:44,458 --> 00:22:47,875
BEING AN EQUALIST IS NOT AN EASY
THING TO BELIEVE, EVEN NOW.

386
00:22:47,917 --> 00:22:49,500
- I KNOW.

387
00:22:49,542 --> 00:22:52,333
I'M SORRY THIS WHOLE
THING HAPPENED.

388
00:22:52,375 --> 00:22:55,291
- SO, DOES YOUR OFFER TO LIVE
AT THE AIR TEMPLE STILL STAND?

389
00:22:55,333 --> 00:22:57,542
- OF COURSE IT DOES.

390
00:22:57,583 --> 00:22:59,125
AND ASAMI'S WELCOME TOO.

391
00:22:59,166 --> 00:23:01,333
- THANK YOU SO MUCH.

392
00:23:01,375 --> 00:23:03,583
- AFTER EVERYTHING
SHE'S BEEN THROUGH,

393
00:23:03,625 --> 00:23:06,291
SHE'S GOING TO NEED YOU, MAKO.
