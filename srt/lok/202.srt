1
00:00:07,625 --> 00:00:08,583
- EARTH.

2
00:00:08,625 --> 00:00:10,458
FIRE.

3
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:12,041
AIR.

4
00:00:12,083 --> 00:00:14,417
WATER.

5
00:00:14,458 --> 00:00:18,417
ONLY THE AVATAR
CAN MASTER ALL FOUR ELEMENTS

6
00:00:18,458 --> 00:00:22,125
AND BRING BALANCE
TO THE WORLD.

7
00:00:27,166 --> 00:00:29,083
- THE SOUTHERN WATER TRIBE
IS UNDER SIEGE.

8
00:00:29,125 --> 00:00:31,542
WHEN AVATAR KORRA
WAS ATTACKED BY A DARK SPIRIT,

9
00:00:31,583 --> 00:00:34,291
CHIEF UNALAQ WAS THE ONLY ONE
ABLE TO STOP IT.

10
00:00:34,333 --> 00:00:35,625
SO KORRA TURNED
HER BACK ON TENZIN

11
00:00:35,667 --> 00:00:37,750
AND CHOSE UNALAQ
AS HER NEW SPIRITUAL MENTOR.

12
00:00:37,792 --> 00:00:39,917
TENZIN AND HIS FAMILY
LEFT FOR A VACATION

13
00:00:39,959 --> 00:00:41,250
AT THE SOUTHERN AIR TEMPLE,

14
00:00:41,291 --> 00:00:42,917
WHILE KORRA REMAINED
IN THE WATER TRIBE.

15
00:00:42,959 --> 00:00:44,625
WILL SHE BE ABLE
TO RESTORE BALANCE

16
00:00:44,667 --> 00:00:46,333
BETWEEN HUMANS AND SPIRITS?

17
00:01:03,667 --> 00:01:05,333
- YOU'RE EARLY.

18
00:01:05,375 --> 00:01:06,750
- WHAT CAN I SAY?

19
00:01:06,792 --> 00:01:09,500
I'M PUMPED UP TO LEARN
THAT UNALAQ SPIRIT FIGHTING.

20
00:01:09,542 --> 00:01:11,625
- I'M NOT HERE TO TEACH YOU
TO FIGHT SPIRITS.

21
00:01:11,667 --> 00:01:13,875
I'M HERE TO HELP YOU
BEGIN YOUR SPIRITUAL TRAINING.

22
00:01:13,917 --> 00:01:16,917
WE'RE GOING TO ONE OF THE MOST
REMOTE PLACES IN THE WORLD--

23
00:01:16,959 --> 00:01:20,667
THE LONG-NEGLECTED
SPIRITUAL CENTER OF YOUR TRIBE:

24
00:01:20,709 --> 00:01:21,875
THE SOUTH POLE.

25
00:01:21,917 --> 00:01:23,667
- YOU'RE GONNA TRAIN ME
AT THE SOUTH POLE?

26
00:01:23,709 --> 00:01:26,000
- WE WILL DO MORE
THAN JUST TRAIN.

27
00:01:26,041 --> 00:01:28,458
BY NEGLECTING THE SPIRITS,
THE PEOPLE OF THE SOUTH

28
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:30,333
HAVE BROUGHT DARKNESS
UPON THEMSELVES,

29
00:01:30,375 --> 00:01:33,333
AND NOW IT THREATENS
TO DESTROY OUR TRIBE.

30
00:01:33,375 --> 00:01:36,250
WE MUST SET THINGS RIGHT.

31
00:01:36,291 --> 00:01:38,375
THE SOUTHERN WATER TRIBE
DEPENDS ON YOU.

32
00:01:38,417 --> 00:01:40,792
- A DANGEROUS TRIP
TO THE SOUTH POLE?

33
00:01:40,834 --> 00:01:43,083
COUNT ME IN.

34
00:01:47,834 --> 00:01:50,166
- THERE IT IS,
THE SOUTHERN AIR TEMPLE.

35
00:01:50,208 --> 00:01:53,875
ISN'T IT MAGNIFICENT?

36
00:01:58,709 --> 00:02:02,125
- MASTER TENZIN, WELCOME.

37
00:02:02,166 --> 00:02:04,709
- GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN,
ABBOT SHUNG.

38
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:06,041
- IS THERE ANYTHING
YOU NEED?

39
00:02:06,083 --> 00:02:08,333
WATER?
DANDELION GREENS?

40
00:02:08,375 --> 00:02:10,417
AH, PERHAPS YOU'D LIKE
TO RE-CENTER YOURSELF

41
00:02:10,458 --> 00:02:12,375
BY MEDITATING
IN THE GARDENS.

42
00:02:12,417 --> 00:02:13,542
- NO, THANK YOU.

43
00:02:13,583 --> 00:02:14,792
I'M FINE.

44
00:02:14,834 --> 00:02:17,083
- AND YOU MUST
BE THE HONORABLE PEMA.

45
00:02:17,125 --> 00:02:18,500
PLEASE,
ACCEPT THESE GIFTS.

46
00:02:18,542 --> 00:02:21,875
THIS IS AN ANCIENT
AIRBENDER HEAD SHAVER

47
00:02:21,917 --> 00:02:24,041
WE'VE REFURBISHED
JUST FOR YOU.

48
00:02:24,083 --> 00:02:26,875
- OH...OKAY.

49
00:02:26,917 --> 00:02:31,208
- AND PEMA, THESE FLOWERS
ONCE FILLED THE MOUNTAINSIDE.

50
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:33,583
NOW THEY CAN
BRIGHTEN UP YOUR ROOM.

51
00:02:33,625 --> 00:02:35,875
- THAT'S...SWEET?

52
00:02:35,917 --> 00:02:37,709
YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO.

53
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:39,250
- NONSENSE.

54
00:02:39,291 --> 00:02:40,834
WHATEVER YOU NEED
IS YOURS.

55
00:02:40,875 --> 00:02:42,083
ANYTHING FOR THE MOTHER

56
00:02:42,125 --> 00:02:44,125
OF THE NEXT GENERATION
OF AIRBENDERS.

57
00:02:44,166 --> 00:02:46,625
- NO! THAT GIFT IS MINE.

58
00:02:46,667 --> 00:02:48,041
- YOU DON'T EVEN LIKE TO READ.

59
00:02:48,083 --> 00:02:49,875
- NAAH.

60
00:02:49,917 --> 00:02:53,291
- YEP, THOSE ARE THE WORLD'S
NEXT GENERATION OF AIRBENDERS.

61
00:02:53,333 --> 00:02:54,792
- MOMMY, DADDY, LOOK.

62
00:02:54,834 --> 00:02:56,208
I FINALLY GOT A LEMUR.

63
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:58,750
I'M GONNA NAME HIM POKI.

64
00:02:58,792 --> 00:03:03,458
POKI, COME BACK!

65
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:05,667
- UGH.

66
00:03:05,709 --> 00:03:07,083
PHEW.

67
00:03:07,125 --> 00:03:08,417
EXCUSE ME,
A LITTLE HELP HERE.

68
00:03:08,458 --> 00:03:11,875
- SORRY, I THOUGHT
YOU WERE THE SERVANTS.

69
00:03:11,917 --> 00:03:14,041
- WE'RE TENZIN'S
BROTHER AND SISTER.

70
00:03:14,083 --> 00:03:16,458
- AVATAR AANG
HAD OTHER CHILDREN?

71
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,583
THE WORLD IS FILLED
WITH MORE AIRBENDERS?

72
00:03:18,625 --> 00:03:20,250
- WE'RE NOT AIRBENDERS.

73
00:03:20,291 --> 00:03:23,250
- OH.
I'M SO SORRY.

74
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:31,208
- I THOUGHT YOU SAID
BOLIN WAS COMING.

75
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:33,834
- HE SAID HE'D BE HERE,
BUT I CAN'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

76
00:03:33,875 --> 00:03:35,667
I HAVE TO MAKE SURE
YOU HAVE EVERYTHING YOU NEED

77
00:03:35,709 --> 00:03:37,250
FOR A SAFE TRIP.

78
00:03:37,291 --> 00:03:39,500
- THANKS, CAPTAIN EXPEDITION,
BUT I'LL BE FINE.

79
00:03:39,542 --> 00:03:43,208
[engine hums]

80
00:03:47,542 --> 00:03:49,875
- TONRAQ,
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

81
00:03:49,917 --> 00:03:51,875
- I HEARD YOU'RE TAKING
KORRA TO THE SOUTH POLE.

82
00:03:51,917 --> 00:03:52,917
I'M COMING.

83
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:54,333
- ABSOLUTELY NOT.

84
00:03:54,375 --> 00:03:55,917
YOU'RE A DISTRACTION
TO KORRA

85
00:03:55,959 --> 00:03:57,834
AND A HINDRANCE
TO WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE.

86
00:03:57,875 --> 00:04:00,125
MY DAUGHTER
IS NOT GOING WITHOUT ME.

87
00:04:00,166 --> 00:04:02,333
SHE NEEDS SOMEONE
TO WATCH AFTER HER.

88
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:05,208
- DAD, WHY DO YOU ALWAYS THINK
YOU KNOW WHAT'S BEST FOR ME?

89
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:07,834
- BECAUSE HE'S MISGUIDED.

90
00:04:07,875 --> 00:04:10,041
THE SAD TRUTH IS
IT'S MEN LIKE YOUR FATHER

91
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:12,417
WHO HAVE PUT THE SPIRIT WORLD
OUT OF BALANCE.

92
00:04:12,458 --> 00:04:13,834
HE'S IGNORED MY WARNINGS
IN THE PAST

93
00:04:13,875 --> 00:04:15,458
AND HASN'T LEARNED SINCE.

94
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:17,125
- WHAT HAPPENED IN THE PAST?

95
00:04:17,166 --> 00:04:18,875
- IT DOESN'T MATTER.

96
00:04:18,917 --> 00:04:20,333
WHAT MATTERS
IS THE EVERSTORM.

97
00:04:20,375 --> 00:04:21,750
- THE EVERSTORM?

98
00:04:21,792 --> 00:04:23,166
- IT'S A MASSIVE BLIZZARD

99
00:04:23,208 --> 00:04:25,667
THAT'S BATTERED
THE SOUTH POLE FOR DECADES.

100
00:04:25,709 --> 00:04:29,417
I'M COMING, UNLESS YOU THINK
YOU CAN STOP ME.

101
00:04:33,166 --> 00:04:37,083
- GUYS!
HEY, WAIT FOR ME!

102
00:04:41,417 --> 00:04:42,667
CHECK IT OUT.

103
00:04:42,709 --> 00:04:44,333
I'M TRAVELING IN STYLE.
[engine revs]

104
00:04:44,375 --> 00:04:46,667
WHOA!
OKAY, I'M SORRY.

105
00:04:46,709 --> 00:04:48,583
STILL GETTING USED
TO THAT THROTTLE.

106
00:04:48,625 --> 00:04:50,375
- UH, WHERE'D YOU
GET THE RIDE?

107
00:04:50,417 --> 00:04:52,125
- VARRICK.
HE'S AWESOME.

108
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:53,500
HE ALSO GAVE ME
THIS FANCY SNOWSUIT.

109
00:04:53,542 --> 00:04:55,417
IT'S INFLATABLE
WITH AN INTERNAL HEATER,

110
00:04:55,458 --> 00:04:57,625
EMERGENCY BEACON,
AND FOOD RATION POUCH.

111
00:04:57,667 --> 00:04:59,458
I MEAN, IF I GET LOST,
I CAN SURVIVE IN THIS THING

112
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:01,083
FOR, LIKE,
LIKE, A MONTH.

113
00:05:01,125 --> 00:05:02,542
WHO WANTS SOME FREEZE-DRIED
CUCUMBER-QUATS?

114
00:05:02,583 --> 00:05:04,125
NOBODY?

115
00:05:04,166 --> 00:05:06,583
DID I INTERRUPT
A CONVERSATION?

116
00:05:06,625 --> 00:05:07,834
[Pabu squeaks]

117
00:05:07,875 --> 00:05:09,959
- NO, THE CONVERSATION
IS OVER.

118
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,750
DAD, COME IF YOU WANT.

119
00:05:11,792 --> 00:05:13,792
JUST DON'T INTERFERE
WITH MY TRAINING.

120
00:05:15,834 --> 00:05:19,166
- DOES THIS SIDECAR HAVE
THE CAPACITY FOR TWO PASSENGERS?

121
00:05:19,208 --> 00:05:20,625
- SURE DOES.

122
00:05:20,667 --> 00:05:23,417
BUT, UH, WHO'S GONNA DRIVE?

123
00:05:23,458 --> 00:05:28,125
[engine humming]

124
00:05:29,667 --> 00:05:31,208
- WELL, WHAT DO YOU KNOW?

125
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:34,458
LOOKS LIKE--
- GO AWAY, MAKO.

126
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:37,417
- SO ONCE WE GET TO THE SOUTH
POLE, THEN WHAT HAPPENS?

127
00:05:37,458 --> 00:05:40,375
- YOU WILL OPEN
AN ANCIENT SPIRIT PORTAL.

128
00:05:40,417 --> 00:05:41,917
- I'M SORRY.
WHAT NOW?

129
00:05:41,959 --> 00:05:43,917
- AT THE SOUTH POLE,
THERE IS A PORTAL

130
00:05:43,959 --> 00:05:46,417
THAT CONNECTS OUR WORLD
TO THE SPIRIT WORLD.

131
00:05:46,458 --> 00:05:48,583
BUT IT HAS LONG BEEN CLOSED.

132
00:05:48,625 --> 00:05:50,750
- AND THAT'S WHY
THE EVIL SPIRITS ARE ATTACKING?

133
00:05:50,792 --> 00:05:52,542
- THERE ARE NO EVIL SPIRITS.
[lightning cracks]

134
00:05:52,583 --> 00:05:56,250
THERE IS LIGHT
AND DARK IN THEM ALL.

135
00:05:56,291 --> 00:06:00,083
BUT WHEN THEY'RE UNBALANCED,
THE DARKNESS TAKES OVER.

136
00:06:00,125 --> 00:06:01,750
IF YOU CAN OPEN
THE PORTAL IN TIME,

137
00:06:01,792 --> 00:06:04,333
BALANCE WILL BE RESTORED.

138
00:06:04,375 --> 00:06:06,250
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN
"IN TIME"?

139
00:06:06,291 --> 00:06:08,417
- THERE'S A REASON
THE GLACIER SPIRITS FESTIVAL

140
00:06:08,458 --> 00:06:10,208
ENDS ON THE WINTER SOLSTICE.

141
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:11,834
THAT'S WHEN THE SPIRIT WORLD

142
00:06:11,875 --> 00:06:14,000
AND THE PHYSICAL WORLD
ARE CLOSE TOGETHER.

143
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:17,500
- ONLY THEN CAN THE AVATAR
OPEN THE PORTAL.

144
00:06:17,542 --> 00:06:19,083
- THE WINTER SOLSTICE
IS TOMORROW.

145
00:06:19,125 --> 00:06:20,542
- EXACTLY.

146
00:06:20,583 --> 00:06:23,000
AND WE CAN'T AFFORD
TO WAIT ANOTHER YEAR.

147
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:29,291
[spirit hisses]

148
00:06:29,333 --> 00:06:32,208
[growls]

149
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:35,917
- EASY, NAGA.
[continues growling]

150
00:06:39,583 --> 00:06:41,083
- WHAT ARE THOSE?

151
00:06:42,041 --> 00:06:44,083
- DARK SPIRITS.

152
00:06:48,125 --> 00:06:49,542
- LET'S KEEP MOVING.

153
00:06:49,583 --> 00:06:53,000
WE HAVE TO FIND
A SAFE PLACE TO SET UP CAMP.

154
00:06:59,917 --> 00:07:01,250
- UNCLE, WHY DO YOU THINK
THE DARK SPIRITS

155
00:07:01,291 --> 00:07:02,709
ARE FOLLOWING US?

156
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:05,291
- CAN WE NOT TALK
ABOUT DARK SPIRITS, PLEASE?

157
00:07:05,333 --> 00:07:06,875
- MY BROTHER
DOESN'T LIKE GHOST STORIES.

158
00:07:06,917 --> 00:07:08,375
- DON'T WORRY.

159
00:07:08,417 --> 00:07:10,041
I WILL PROTECT YOU,
MY FEEBLE TURTLE-DUCK.

160
00:07:10,083 --> 00:07:11,500
- THANK YOU.

161
00:07:11,542 --> 00:07:13,750
- SADLY,
THIS ISN'T A GHOST STORY.

162
00:07:13,792 --> 00:07:15,417
THIS IS REAL.

163
00:07:15,458 --> 00:07:16,792
- [gasps]

164
00:07:16,834 --> 00:07:19,417
- THE SPIRITS ARE ANGRY
BECAUSE HE'S HERE.

165
00:07:19,458 --> 00:07:21,125
HAVEN'T YOU EVER WONDERED
HOW YOUR FATHER

166
00:07:21,166 --> 00:07:23,667
ENDED UP
IN THE SOUTH POLE?

167
00:07:23,709 --> 00:07:26,333
WHY HE'S NEVER TAKEN YOU TO
VISIT HIS HOMELAND IN THE NORTH?

168
00:07:26,375 --> 00:07:28,542
- UNALAQ,
THIS IS NOT THE TIME.

169
00:07:28,583 --> 00:07:30,458
- YOU'RE RIGHT.

170
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:32,375
YOU SHOULD HAVE TOLD HER
A LONG TIME AGO.

171
00:07:32,417 --> 00:07:35,041
- TOLD ME WHAT?

172
00:07:35,083 --> 00:07:37,792
- I LEFT THE NORTH POLE
BECAUSE...

173
00:07:37,834 --> 00:07:40,500
I WAS BANISHED.

174
00:07:44,667 --> 00:07:47,625
- YOU WERE BANISHED

00:19:25,625 --> 00:19:29,291
WHAT AVATAR IS THIS?

353
00:19:32,083 --> 00:19:36,000
- THE LIGHT IN THE DARK.

354
00:19:37,792 --> 00:19:40,709
[grunts]

355
00:19:52,166 --> 00:19:56,083
- WHY ISN'T IT OPENING?

356
00:19:57,250 --> 00:19:58,917
[gasps]

357
00:20:03,667 --> 00:20:08,250
COME ON, PORTAL.
OPEN!

358
00:20:08,291 --> 00:20:10,959
[spirit hisses]

359
00:20:13,125 --> 00:20:14,375
[grunts]

360
00:20:14,417 --> 00:20:17,333
[gasps]

361
00:20:25,083 --> 00:20:28,000
[grunts]

362
00:20:40,917 --> 00:20:43,959
[warbling chime, rumbling]

363
00:20:45,709 --> 00:20:48,625
OOF!

364
00:20:55,667 --> 00:20:59,417
THE SPIRITS
DANCING IN THE SKY.

365
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:07,166
- [gasps]

366
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:16,458
- I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

367
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:19,417
- IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

368
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:33,917
- SHE DID IT.

369
00:21:37,458 --> 00:21:39,333
- HEY, KORRA, YOU'RE BACK!

370
00:21:39,375 --> 00:21:43,041
HEY, KORRA'S BACK.

371
00:21:45,083 --> 00:21:46,625
WHA--HUH?

372
00:21:46,667 --> 00:21:49,000
- WHY ARE YOU INITIATING
PHYSICAL CONTACT

373
00:21:49,041 --> 00:21:50,417
WITH ANOTHER WOMAN?

374
00:21:50,458 --> 00:21:53,291
- [gulps and laughs nervously]

375
00:21:53,333 --> 00:21:56,291
- EVERYTHING YOU SAID
WAS TRUE.

376
00:21:56,333 --> 00:21:58,834
- AVATAR KORRA,
YOU HAVE TAKEN THE FIRST STEP

377
00:21:58,875 --> 00:22:01,542
IN BRINGING BALANCE
BACK TO THE SOUTH,

378
00:22:01,583 --> 00:22:05,750
AND SOON,
THE WHOLE WORLD.

379
00:22:05,792 --> 00:22:09,792
- YOU NEVER CEASE TO AMAZE ME.
- THANKS.

380
00:22:09,834 --> 00:22:13,000
BY THE WAY, I'M REALLY SORRY
FOR BEING A TOTAL PAIN.

381
00:22:13,041 --> 00:22:14,917
THINGS WERE REALLY STRESSFUL
AND CONFUSING.

382
00:22:14,959 --> 00:22:17,458
IT'S HARD BEING THE AVATAR.

383
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:18,917
- IT'S HARDER
BEING THE AVATAR'S BOYFRIEND.

384
00:22:18,959 --> 00:22:21,875
- [laughs]

385
00:22:45,333 --> 00:22:48,458
WHAT ARE ALL YOUR
NORTHERN TROOPS DOING HERE?

386
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:51,250
- OPENING THE SPIRIT PORTAL
WAS ONLY THE FIRST STEP

387
00:22:51,291 --> 00:22:52,458
IN GETTING
THE SOUTHERN WATER TRIBE

388
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:54,583
BACK ON ITS RIGHTEOUS PATH.

389
00:22:54,625 --> 00:22:56,834
THERE'S MORE DIFFICULT WORK
TO BE DONE

390
00:22:56,875 --> 00:23:00,041
BEFORE OUR TWO TRIBES
ARE TRULY UNITED.
