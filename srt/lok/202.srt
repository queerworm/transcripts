1
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:09,448
Earth.

2
00:00:09,449 --> 00:00:11,216
Fire.

3
00:00:11,217 --> 00:00:12,751
Air.

4
00:00:12,752 --> 00:00:14,820
Water.

5
00:00:14,821 --> 00:00:18,990
Only the Avatar
can master all four elements

6
00:00:18,991 --> 00:00:23,991
and bring balance to the world.

7
00:00:27,467 --> 00:00:29,601
The Southern
Water Tribe is under siege.

8
00:00:29,602 --> 00:00:32,270
When Avatar Korra
was attacked by a dark spirit,

9
00:00:32,271 --> 00:00:34,740
Chief Unalaq was the only one
able to stop it.

10
00:00:34,741 --> 00:00:36,308
So Korra turned her back on Tenzin

11
00:00:36,309 --> 00:00:38,443
and chose Unalaq
as her new spiritual mentor.

12
00:00:38,444 --> 00:00:40,545
Tenzin and his family
left for a vacation

13
00:00:40,546 --> 00:00:41,713
at the Southern Air Temple,

14
00:00:41,714 --> 00:00:43,548
while Korra remained in the Water Tribe.

15
00:00:43,549 --> 00:00:45,350
Will she be able to restore balance

16
00:00:45,351 --> 00:00:50,351
between humans and spirits?

17
00:01:04,270 --> 00:01:05,403
- You're early.

18
00:01:05,404 --> 00:01:06,671
- What can I say?

19
00:01:06,672 --> 00:01:09,541
I'm pumped up to learn
that Unalaq spirit fighting.

20
00:01:09,542 --> 00:01:11,943
- I'm not here to teach you
to fight spirits.

21
00:01:11,944 --> 00:01:14,279
I'm here to help you
begin your spiritual training.

22
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:17,482
We're going to one of the most
remote places in the world--

23
00:01:17,483 --> 00:01:20,652
the long-neglected
spiritual center of your tribe:

24
00:01:20,653 --> 00:01:21,887
the South Pole.

25
00:01:21,888 --> 00:01:24,322
- You're gonna train me
at the South Pole?

26
00:01:24,323 --> 00:01:26,558
- We will do more than just train.

27
00:01:26,559 --> 00:01:28,827
By neglecting the spirits,
the people of the South

28
00:01:28,828 --> 00:01:30,762
have brought darkness
upon themselves,

29
00:01:30,763 --> 00:01:33,965
and now it threatens
to destroy our tribe.

30
00:01:33,966 --> 00:01:35,801
We must set things right.

31
00:01:35,802 --> 00:01:38,970
The Southern Water Tribe
depends on you.

32
00:01:38,971 --> 00:01:40,972
- A dangerous trip to the South Pole?

33
00:01:40,973 --> 00:01:45,973
Count me in.

34
00:01:47,613 --> 00:01:50,816
- There it is,
the Southern Air Temple.

35
00:01:50,817 --> 00:01:55,817
Isn't it magnificent?

36
00:01:58,791 --> 00:02:02,727
- Master Tenzin, welcome.

37
00:02:02,728 --> 00:02:05,330
- Good to see you again,
Abbot Shung.

38
00:02:05,331 --> 00:02:06,698
- Is there anything you need?

39
00:02:06,699 --> 00:02:08,733
Water?
Dandelion greens?

40
00:02:08,734 --> 00:02:10,936
Ah, perhaps you'd like
to re-center yourself

41
00:02:10,937 --> 00:02:12,938
by meditating in the gardens.

42
00:02:12,939 --> 00:02:14,239
- No, thank you.

43
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,273
I'm fine.

44
00:02:15,274 --> 00:02:17,576
- And you must
be the honorable Pema.

45
00:02:17,577 --> 00:02:19,211
Please, accept these gifts.

46
00:02:19,212 --> 00:02:22,447
This is an ancient
Airbender head shaver

47
00:02:22,448 --> 00:02:24,716
we've refurbished just for you.

48
00:02:24,717 --> 00:02:27,285
- Oh...okay.

49
00:02:27,286 --> 00:02:31,690
- And Pema, these flowers
once filled the mountainside.

50
00:02:31,691 --> 00:02:34,292
Now they can brighten up your room.

51
00:02:34,293 --> 00:02:36,461
- That's...sweet?

52
00:02:36,462 --> 00:02:38,363
You didn't have to.

53
00:02:38,364 --> 00:02:39,865
- Nonsense.

54
00:02:39,866 --> 00:02:41,433
Whatever you need is yours.

55
00:02:41,434 --> 00:02:42,601
Anything for the mother

56
00:02:42,602 --> 00:02:44,803
of the next generation of Airbenders.

57
00:02:44,804 --> 00:02:47,305
- No! That gift is mine.

58
00:02:47,306 --> 00:02:48,740
- You don't even like to read.

59
00:02:48,741 --> 00:02:50,375
- Naah.

60
00:02:50,376 --> 00:02:53,912
- Yep, those are the world's
next generation of Airbenders.

61
00:02:53,913 --> 00:02:55,447
- Mommy, Daddy, look.

62
00:02:55,448 --> 00:02:56,848
I finally got a lemur.

63
00:02:56,849 --> 00:02:59,517
I'm gonna name him Poki.

64
00:02:59,518 --> 00:03:03,955
Poki, come back!

65
00:03:03,956 --> 00:03:06,458
- Ugh.

66
00:03:06,459 --> 00:03:07,559
Phew.

67
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:08,927
Excuse me, a little help here.

68
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:12,430
- Sorry, I thought
you were the servants.

69
00:03:12,431 --> 00:03:14,532
- We're Tenzin's brother and sister.

70
00:03:14,533 --> 00:03:16,801
- Avatar Aang had other children?

71
00:03:16,802 --> 00:03:19,237
The world is filled
with more Airbenders?

72
00:03:19,238 --> 00:03:20,672
- We're not Airbenders.

73
00:03:20,673 --> 00:03:25,673
- Oh.
I'm so sorry.

74
00:03:28,881 --> 00:03:31,683
- I thought you said Bolin was coming.

75
00:03:31,684 --> 00:03:34,419
- He said he'd be here,
but I can't worry about it.

76
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:36,321
I have to make sure
you have everything you need

77
00:03:36,322 --> 00:03:37,589
for a safe trip.

78
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:40,225
- Thanks, Captain Expedition,
but I'll be fine.

79
00:03:48,234 --> 00:03:50,468
- Tonraq, what do you want?

80
00:03:50,469 --> 00:03:52,470
- I heard you're taking
Korra to the South Pole.

81
00:03:52,471 --> 00:03:53,672
I'm coming.

82
00:03:53,673 --> 00:03:54,773
- Absolutely not.

83
00:03:54,774 --> 00:03:56,474
You're a distraction to Korra

84
00:03:56,475 --> 00:03:58,443
and a hindrance
to what needs to be done.

85
00:03:58,444 --> 00:04:00,578
- My daughter is not going without me.

86
00:04:00,579 --> 00:04:02,681
She needs someone
to watch after her.

87
00:04:02,682 --> 00:04:05,784
- Dad, why do you always think
you know what's best for me?

88
00:04:05,785 --> 00:04:08,386
- Because he's misguided.

89
00:04:08,387 --> 00:04:10,522
The sad truth is
it's men like your father

90
00:04:10,523 --> 00:04:12,757
who have put the spirit world
out of balance.

91
00:04:12,758 --> 00:04:14,392
He's ignored my warnings in the past

92
00:04:14,393 --> 00:04:15,927
and hasn't learned since.

93
00:04:15,928 --> 00:04:17,729
- What happened in the past?

94
00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:19,397
- It doesn't matter.

95
00:04:19,398 --> 00:04:20,865
What matters is the Everstorm.

96
00:04:20,866 --> 00:04:22,300
- The Everstorm?

97
00:04:22,301 --> 00:04:23,535
- It's a massive blizzard

98
00:04:23,536 --> 00:04:25,937
that's battered
the South Pole for decades.

99
00:04:25,938 --> 00:04:30,938
I'm coming,
unless you think you can stop me.

100
00:04:33,779 --> 00:04:38,779
- Guys!
Hey, wait for me!

101
00:04:41,921 --> 00:04:43,254
Check it out.

102
00:04:43,255 --> 00:04:44,889
I'm traveling in style.

103
00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:47,292
Whoa!
Okay, I'm sorry.

104
00:04:47,293 --> 00:04:49,260
Still getting used to that throttle.

105
00:04:49,261 --> 00:04:50,929
- Uh, where'd you get the ride?

106
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:52,597
- Varrick.
He's awesome.

107
00:04:52,598 --> 00:04:53,999
He also gave me
this fancy snowsuit.

108
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,800
It's inflatable
with an internal heater,

109
00:04:55,801 --> 00:04:57,969
emergency beacon,
and food ration pouch.

110
00:04:57,970 --> 00:04:59,938
I mean, if I get lost,
I can survive in this thing

111
00:04:59,939 --> 00:05:01,506
for, like, like, a month.

112
00:05:01,507 --> 00:05:03,341
Who wants some freeze-dried
cucumber-quats?

113
00:05:03,342 --> 00:05:04,709
Nobody?

114
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:07,212
Did I interrupt a conversation?

115
00:05:08,381 --> 00:05:10,615
- No, the conversation is over.

116
00:05:10,616 --> 00:05:12,317
Dad, come if you want.

117
00:05:12,318 --> 00:05:16,354
Just don't interfere with my training.

118
00:05:16,355 --> 00:05:19,724
- Does this sidecar have
the capacity for two passengers?

119
00:05:19,725 --> 00:05:21,226
- Sure does.

120
00:05:21,227 --> 00:05:23,928
But, uh, who's gonna drive?

121
00:05:30,269 --> 00:05:31,803
- Well, what do you know?

122
00:05:31,804 --> 00:05:34,372
Looks like--
- Go away, Mako.

123
00:05:34,373 --> 00:05:37,942
- So once we get to the South Pole,
then what happens?

124
00:05:37,943 --> 00:05:40,311
- You will open
an ancient spirit portal.

125
00:05:40,312 --> 00:05:42,447
- I'm sorry.
What now?

126
00:05:42,448 --> 00:05:44,449
- At the South Pole,
there is a portal

127
00:05:44,450 --> 00:05:46,951
that connects our world
to the spirit world.

128
00:05:46,952 --> 00:05:49,254
But it has long been closed.

129
00:05:49,255 --> 00:05:50,989
- And that's why
the evil spirits are attacking?

130
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:53,224
- There are no evil spirits.

131
00:05:53,225 --> 00:05:56,694
There is light and dark in them all.

132
00:05:56,695 --> 00:06:00,532
But when they're unbalanced,
the darkness takes over.

133
00:06:00,533 --> 00:06:02,267
If you can open the portal in time,

134
00:06:02,268 --> 00:06:04,636
balance will be restored.

135
00:06:04,637 --> 00:06:06,604
- What do you mean "in time"?

136
00:06:06,605 --> 00:06:08,873
- There's a reason
the Glacier Spirits Festival

137
00:06:08,874 --> 00:06:10,575
ends on the winter solstice.

138
00:06:10,576 --> 00:06:12,343
That's when the spirit world

139
00:06:12,344 --> 00:06:14,446
and the physical world
are close together.

140
00:06:14,447 --> 00:06:17,916
Only then can the Avatar
open the portal.

141
00:06:17,917 --> 00:06:19,684
- The winter solstice is tomorrow.

142
00:06:19,685 --> 00:06:20,952
- Exactly.

143
00:06:20,953 --> 00:06:25,953
And we can't afford
to wait another year.

144
00:06:32,832 --> 00:06:37,832
- Easy, Naga.

145
00:06:40,206 --> 00:06:42,640
- What are those?

146
00:06:42,641 --> 00:06:47,641
- Dark spirits.

147
00:06:48,681 --> 00:06:49,981
- Let's keep moving.

148
00:06:49,982 --> 00:06:54,982
We have to find
a safe place to set up camp.

149
00:07:00,693 --> 00:07:01,759
- Uncle, why do you think
the dark spirits

150
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:02,927
are following us?

151
00:07:02,928 --> 00:07:05,630
- Can we not talk
about dark spirits, please?

152
00:07:05,631 --> 00:07:07,365
- My brother doesn't like ghost stories.

153
00:07:07,366 --> 00:07:08,666
- Don't worry.

154
00:07:08,667 --> 00:07:10,635
I will protect you,
my feeble turtle-duck.

155
00:07:10,636 --> 00:07:11,703
- Thank you.

156
00:07:11,704 --> 00:07:14,272
- Sadly, this isn't a ghost story.

157
00:07:14,273 --> 00:07:15,874
This is real.

158
00:07:17,276 --> 00:07:19,744
- The spirits are angry
because he's here.

159
00:07:19,745 --> 00:07:21,713
Haven't you ever wondered
how your father

160
00:07:21,714 --> 00:07:23,882
ended up in the South Pole?

161
00:07:23,883 --> 00:07:26,651
Why he's never taken you
to visit his homeland in the north?

162
00:07:26,652 --> 00:07:28,953
- Unalaq, this is not the time.

163
00:07:28,954 --> 00:07:30,755
- You're right.

164
00:07:30,756 --> 00:07:32,857
You should have told her
a long time ago.

165
00:07:32,858 --> 00:07:35,493
- Told me what?

166
00:07:35,494 --> 00:07:38,329
- I left the North Pole because...

167
00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:43,330
I was banished.

168
00:07:43,936 --> 00:07:46,804
- You were banished from the North? Why?

169
00:07:46,805 --> 00:07:50,975
- Because I almost destroyed
the entire tribe.

170
00:07:50,976 --> 00:07:53,945
20 years ago, I was a general
in the Northern Water Tribe,

171
00:07:53,946 --> 00:07:58,946
sworn to protect my people.

172
00:08:01,287 --> 00:08:06,287
- Brother, we're being attacked.

173
00:08:20,406 --> 00:08:23,541
Tonraq: I drove them out of the city
and deep into the frozen tundra.

174
00:08:44,196 --> 00:08:49,196
We tracked them deep
into an ancient forest.

175
00:08:52,504 --> 00:08:55,640
Many believed this forest
was the home to spirits,

176
00:08:55,641 --> 00:08:57,308
and the barbarians retreated there

177
00:08:57,309 --> 00:08:58,409
because they thought we wouldn't attack

178
00:08:58,410 --> 00:09:01,379
on such hallowed grounds.

179
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:05,149
They thought wrong.

180
00:09:13,292 --> 00:09:14,892
- We captured the barbarians,

181
00:09:14,893 --> 00:09:19,893
but in the process,
we destroyed the forest.

182
00:09:23,335 --> 00:09:25,203
I didn't realize the consequences

183
00:09:25,204 --> 00:09:26,371
of what I had done.

184
00:09:28,374 --> 00:09:30,241
By destroying the forest,

185
00:09:30,242 --> 00:09:34,746
I unknowingly let loose angry spirits.

186
00:09:40,853 --> 00:09:43,254
They threatened to destroy everything.

187
00:09:43,255 --> 00:09:48,255
The entire city.

188
00:10:03,409 --> 00:10:06,377
Unalaq was able to guide
the spirits back to the forest,

189
00:10:06,378 --> 00:10:11,378
but by then,
the damage had been done.

190
00:10:19,091 --> 00:10:21,959
For being the cause
of so much devastation,

191
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:24,362
my father banished me
from the Northern Water Tribe

192
00:10:24,363 --> 00:10:29,363
in shame.

193
00:10:31,737 --> 00:10:36,737
That's when I came to the South
and started a new life.

194
00:10:40,713 --> 00:10:41,979
- Whoa.

195
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:44,782
So you were supposed to be chief,

196
00:10:44,783 --> 00:10:46,851
then he became chief.

197
00:10:46,852 --> 00:10:48,586
No wonder you guys
don't like each other.

198
00:10:48,587 --> 00:10:50,688
Ow! What?

199
00:10:50,689 --> 00:10:52,323
Isn't that what happened?

200
00:10:52,324 --> 00:10:54,492
- I can't believe
you kept this from me.

201
00:10:54,493 --> 00:10:56,327
- I was protecting you from the shame

202
00:10:56,328 --> 00:10:57,695
I brought on the family.

203
00:10:57,696 --> 00:10:59,530
- Why do you keep hiding things from me

204
00:10:59,531 --> 00:11:01,499
and then telling me
it's for my own protection?

205
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:04,502
I'm tired of you protecting me.

206
00:11:04,503 --> 00:11:09,503
- Korra.

207
00:11:16,348 --> 00:11:17,815
Jinora: Wow.

208
00:11:17,816 --> 00:11:19,283
The statue room.

209
00:11:19,284 --> 00:11:21,452
- That's right, Jinora.

210
00:11:21,453 --> 00:11:25,556
The most sacred place in
the entire Southern Air Temple.

211
00:11:25,557 --> 00:11:30,528
Here you will find statues
of every Avatar who ever lived.

212
00:11:30,529 --> 00:11:33,398
Where are your brother and sister?

213
00:11:35,801 --> 00:11:37,435
- You can't catch me.

214
00:11:37,436 --> 00:11:39,771
I'm the greatest air skater of all time.

215
00:11:39,772 --> 00:11:40,805
Qof!

216
00:11:40,806 --> 00:11:45,806
- Meelo!

217
00:12:16,608 --> 00:12:19,410
- Korra, you have every right
to be mad at me,

218
00:12:19,411 --> 00:12:22,747
but I don't want you to make
the same mistake I made.

219
00:12:22,748 --> 00:12:25,283
I should have never
gone into that forest,

220
00:12:25,284 --> 00:12:28,252
and we shouldn't be going
to the South Pole now.

221
00:12:28,253 --> 00:12:33,253
Spirits and the physical world
should remain separate.

222
00:12:33,358 --> 00:12:35,293
- Dad, it's my job to be the bridge

223
00:12:35,294 --> 00:12:37,228
between the spirits
and the physical world,

224
00:12:37,229 --> 00:12:40,231
and I finally have a chance
to live up to my potential.

225
00:12:40,232 --> 00:12:42,366
- You don't even know
if what Unalaq says is true.

226
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:43,568
- You want proof?

227
00:12:43,569 --> 00:12:45,002
Look to the sky.

228
00:12:45,003 --> 00:12:47,572
Where I'm from,
the spirits are at peace

229
00:12:47,573 --> 00:12:48,973
and they light up the dark.

230
00:12:48,974 --> 00:12:50,808
- The Northern lights.

231
00:12:50,809 --> 00:12:52,577
- Yes.

232
00:12:52,578 --> 00:12:54,812
There used to be lights
in the South as well.

233
00:12:54,813 --> 00:12:56,380
But during the 100 Year War,

234
00:12:56,381 --> 00:12:57,982
the South was thrown out of balance

235
00:12:57,983 --> 00:12:59,550
and the lights disappeared.

236
00:12:59,551 --> 00:13:01,419
When the war ended,
the North helped

237
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:03,654
to rebuild you physically as a nation.

238
00:13:03,655 --> 00:13:06,390
But we have not rebuilt you spiritually.

239
00:13:06,391 --> 00:13:08,926
Now the spirits
no longer dance in your skies.

240
00:13:08,927 --> 00:13:12,563
Instead,
they rampage in the Everstorm.

241
00:13:12,564 --> 00:13:17,564
- I think we're here.

242
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:43,794
- Is that what I think it is?

243
00:13:43,795 --> 00:13:46,998
- We must keep moving.

244
00:13:49,334 --> 00:13:50,801
- Oh, man.

245
00:13:50,802 --> 00:13:52,303
I really don't like this.

246
00:13:52,304 --> 00:13:53,871
- Bolin, just stay calm.

247
00:13:53,872 --> 00:13:54,939
There's no reason to--

248
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:55,973
Panic!

249
00:13:59,945 --> 00:14:04,945
- Aah!

250
00:14:08,887 --> 00:14:11,556
- Korra, look out!

251
00:14:14,693 --> 00:14:17,228
- Oh, it's in the engine!

252
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:49,627
- Is everyone okay?

253
00:14:52,364 --> 00:14:55,366
I can't stop it.

254
00:14:55,367 --> 00:14:57,435
- I'll save you.

255
00:15:00,839 --> 00:15:05,839
I'm a raft!

256
00:15:16,488 --> 00:15:19,557
Uh, can someone please deflate me?

257
00:15:22,961 --> 00:15:24,228
Thank you.

258
00:15:24,229 --> 00:15:25,563
- Oh, great.

259
00:15:25,564 --> 00:15:27,198
There goes our equipment.

260
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:28,466
Now what are we supposed to do?

261
00:15:28,467 --> 00:15:30,368
- There's only one thing to do.

262
00:15:30,369 --> 00:15:32,603
We have to turn back.
- No.

263
00:15:32,604 --> 00:15:33,971
The solstice is tonight.

264
00:15:33,972 --> 00:15:35,239
We're so close.

265
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,741
- This mission is too dangerous.

266
00:15:36,742 --> 00:15:38,809
We're leaving.
- No, Dad.

267
00:15:38,810 --> 00:15:43,810
You're leaving.

268
00:15:49,955 --> 00:15:51,956
- Don't worry, sir.

269
00:15:51,957 --> 00:15:53,557
I'll keep an eye on Korra for you.

270
00:15:53,558 --> 00:15:57,962
- Thank you, Mako.

271
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:04,235
- Let's open this portal
and lead your father

272
00:16:04,236 --> 00:16:05,736
and the entire Southern Water Tribe

273
00:16:05,737 --> 00:16:06,937
in the right direction.

274
00:16:06,938 --> 00:16:08,939
We don't have much time.

275
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:13,940
- Then what are we waiting for?

276
00:16:23,755 --> 00:16:26,457
So, what exactly were
you and my dad talking about?

277
00:16:26,458 --> 00:16:27,658
- Nothing.

278
00:16:27,659 --> 00:16:29,660
He was just worried
about you, that's all.

279
00:16:29,661 --> 00:16:32,329
- You know, sometimes
I wonder whose side you're on.

280
00:16:32,330 --> 00:16:33,764
- There aren't any sides.

281
00:16:33,765 --> 00:16:36,934
We all just want
to help however we can.

282
00:16:36,935 --> 00:16:41,935
You have to trust
that we're here for you.

283
00:16:42,307 --> 00:16:47,307
- We've arrived.

284
00:16:48,413 --> 00:16:50,581
- Trees frozen in ice.

285
00:16:50,582 --> 00:16:52,550
- It's just like the sacred forest

286
00:16:52,551 --> 00:16:54,418
Tonraq destroyed in the north.

287
00:16:54,419 --> 00:16:56,954
- So what do I do?

288
00:16:56,955 --> 00:16:58,823
- You must find your way
to the heart of the forest

289
00:16:58,824 --> 00:17:01,258
where the dormant spirit portal lies.

290
00:17:01,259 --> 00:17:03,461
From here,
you're on your own.

291
00:17:03,462 --> 00:17:04,762
- Wait a second.

292
00:17:04,763 --> 00:17:06,597
There's no way she's going alone.

293
00:17:06,598 --> 00:17:09,266
- Yeah, if she goes, we go too.

294
00:17:09,267 --> 00:17:11,535
- The Avatar must go alone.

295
00:17:11,536 --> 00:17:13,671
- But I don't have any
connection with the spirits.

296
00:17:13,672 --> 00:17:15,906
In fact,
it seems like they hate me.

297
00:17:15,907 --> 00:17:20,907
- You have to believe in yourself
like I believe in you.

298
00:17:21,346 --> 00:17:22,446
What is it?

299
00:17:22,447 --> 00:17:23,814
- I guess I'm just so used to people

300
00:17:23,815 --> 00:17:26,383
telling me how to do things
that I forgot what it was like

301
00:17:26,384 --> 00:17:27,952
to have someone trust in me.

302
00:17:27,953 --> 00:17:32,289
- Korra, all the past Avatars
live on inside of you.

303
00:17:32,290 --> 00:17:34,859
Let them guide you.

304
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:39,860
Let them help you
find the light in the dark.

305
00:17:45,670 --> 00:17:47,638
- Wait here.

306
00:17:47,639 --> 00:17:49,640
I'll be okay.

307
00:17:49,641 --> 00:17:54,641
- Good luck.

308
00:19:02,347 --> 00:19:04,849
The spirit portal.

309
00:19:04,850 --> 00:19:09,850
Amazing.

310
00:19:24,736 --> 00:19:29,736
What Avatar is this?

311
00:19:30,575 --> 00:19:35,575
- The light in the dark.

312
00:19:50,662 --> 00:19:55,662
Why isn't it opening?

313
00:20:03,241 --> 00:20:06,744
Come on, portal.
Open!

314
00:20:55,060 --> 00:21:00,060
The spirits dancing in the sky.

315
00:21:12,844 --> 00:21:15,212
- I can't believe it.

316
00:21:15,213 --> 00:21:20,213
- It's beautiful.

317
00:21:29,327 --> 00:21:34,327
- She did it.

318
00:21:35,867 --> 00:21:37,835
- Hey, Korra, you're back!

319
00:21:37,836 --> 00:21:42,836
Hey, Korra's back.

320
00:21:43,641 --> 00:21:45,009
Wha--huh?

321
00:21:45,010 --> 00:21:47,778
- Why are you initiating
physical contact

322
00:21:47,779 --> 00:21:48,879
with another woman?

323
00:21:51,816 --> 00:21:54,618
- Everything you said was true.

324
00:21:54,619 --> 00:21:57,321
- Avatar Korra,
you have taken the first step

325
00:21:57,322 --> 00:21:59,890
in bringing balance back to the South,

326
00:21:59,891 --> 00:22:04,228
and soon, the whole world.

327
00:22:04,229 --> 00:22:08,265
- You never cease to amaze me.
- Thanks.

328
00:22:08,266 --> 00:22:11,402
By the way, I'm really sorry
for being a total pain.

329
00:22:11,403 --> 00:22:13,504
Things were really stressful
and confusing.

330
00:22:13,505 --> 00:22:15,672
It's hard being the Avatar.

331
00:22:15,673 --> 00:22:17,508
- It's harder
being the Avatar's boyfriend.

332
00:22:44,903 --> 00:22:47,271
What are all your
Northern troops doing here?

333
00:22:47,272 --> 00:22:49,740
- Opening the spirit portal
was only the first step

334
00:22:49,741 --> 00:22:51,275
in getting the Southern Water Tribe

335
00:22:51,276 --> 00:22:53,710
back on its righteous path.

336
00:22:53,711 --> 00:22:55,546
There's more difficult work to be done

337
00:22:55,547 --> 00:23:00,547
before our two tribes are truly united.
