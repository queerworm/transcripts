1
00:00:07,208 --> 00:00:09,291
- EARTH.

2
00:00:09,333 --> 00:00:11,125
FIRE.

3
00:00:11,166 --> 00:00:12,875
AIR.

4
00:00:12,917 --> 00:00:15,000
WATER.

5
00:00:15,041 --> 00:00:19,125
ONLY THE AVATAR CAN MASTER
ALL FOUR ELEMENTS

6
00:00:19,166 --> 00:00:22,333
AND BRING BALANCE
TO THE WORLD.

7
00:00:27,166 --> 00:00:29,792
- AVATAR KORRA IS BACK
AND YOURS TRULY, SHIRO SHINOBI,

8
00:00:29,834 --> 00:00:31,333
COULDN'T BE MORE THRILLED.

9
00:00:31,375 --> 00:00:33,000
IT'S BEEN MY HONOR
TO BRING YOU NEWS

10
00:00:33,041 --> 00:00:34,709
OF KORRA AND HER FRIENDS
OVER THE YEARS.

11
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:36,291
SO MANY HEART-POUNDING MOMENTS!

12
00:00:36,333 --> 00:00:38,667
WHO CAN FORGET AMON
AND HIS EQUALIST REVOLUTION?

13
00:00:38,709 --> 00:00:39,875
I STILL HAVE NIGHTMARES!

14
00:00:39,917 --> 00:00:41,166
THEN THERE WAS THAT TIME

15
00:00:41,208 --> 00:00:42,542
I COVERED THE NUKTUK
MOVER PREMIERE.

16
00:00:42,583 --> 00:00:44,291
BOY, WAS THAT FUN.
BUT ENOUGH ABOUT ME.

17
00:00:44,333 --> 00:00:47,083
SIT BACK, RELAX, AND TAKE A TRIP
DOWN MEMORY LANE.

18
00:00:54,208 --> 00:00:56,959
- YOU KNOW, THERE'S SOMETHING
ABOUT BEING KIDNAPPED

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,583
THAT MAKES A GUY REALIZE HE
NEEDS TO GET HIS ACT TOGETHER.

20
00:00:59,625 --> 00:01:00,917
- YEAH, I AGREE.

21
00:01:00,959 --> 00:01:03,125
LET'S TOUGHEN YOU UP.

22
00:01:05,375 --> 00:01:07,041
- AHH!
I WASN'T READY!

23
00:01:07,083 --> 00:01:08,083
WU DOWN!

24
00:01:08,125 --> 00:01:11,125
- [gasps]
WHAT'S GOING ON?

25
00:01:11,166 --> 00:01:12,667
- [moaning]

26
00:01:12,709 --> 00:01:15,417
- MAKO, HOW DARE YOU INJURE
THE PRINCE?

27
00:01:15,458 --> 00:01:19,875
WOULD HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS LIKE
A CHERRY-BERRY LEMONADE?

28
00:01:19,917 --> 00:01:22,500
- AND MAYBE SOME OF THOSE
STICKY DUMPLINGS TOO?

29
00:01:22,542 --> 00:01:24,125
- LOOK AT YOU.

30
00:01:24,166 --> 00:01:26,625
YOU'RE SO WEAK, "WU DOWN"
IS YOUR CATCHPHRASE.

31
00:01:26,667 --> 00:01:28,417
- I KNOW, I'M A WIMP.

32
00:01:28,458 --> 00:01:31,667
BUT IT'S NOT MY FAULT.
I WAS BORN THAT WAY.

33
00:01:31,709 --> 00:01:33,333
I'M NOT LIKE YOU, MAKO.

34
00:01:33,375 --> 00:01:35,875
I WASN'T RAISED BY
A PACK OF COPS IN THE WOODS.

35
00:01:35,917 --> 00:01:37,417
- YOU DON'T KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT ME, DO YOU?

36
00:01:37,458 --> 00:01:40,458
- YEAH, I'M DRAWING A BLANK.
WHY IS THAT?

37
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:42,875
HOW DO I NOT KNOW STUFF
ABOUT YOU?

38
00:01:42,917 --> 00:01:44,792
- UH...
YOU NEVER ASKED?

39
00:01:44,834 --> 00:01:46,458
- WELL, I'M ASKING NOW.

40
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,792
WHAT'S YOUR FAVORITE FOOD?
WHAT'S YOUR FAVORITE COLOR?

41
00:01:48,834 --> 00:01:50,917
IS THERE A SPECIAL LADY
IN YOUR LIFE?

42
00:01:50,959 --> 00:01:52,667
- NOT SINCE KORRA AND I
BROKE UP.

43
00:01:52,709 --> 00:01:55,375
- WHAT? YOU DATED THE AVATAR?
SIT.

44
00:01:55,417 --> 00:01:57,875
YOU AND I NEED TO HAVE
A LITTLE GAB SESSION RIGHT NOW.

45
00:01:57,917 --> 00:01:59,458
HOW'D YOU GUYS FIRST MEET?

46
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:01,750
- BOLIN AND I WERE PLAYING
FOR THE FIRE FERRETS.

47
00:02:01,792 --> 00:02:03,250
- YOU WERE A PRO-BENDER?

48
00:02:03,291 --> 00:02:04,583
- [sighs]
YES.

49
00:02:04,625 --> 00:02:06,291
WILL YOU JUST LET ME
TELL THE STORY?

50
00:02:06,333 --> 00:02:07,834
- CARRY ON.

51
00:02:07,875 --> 00:02:09,417
- BOLIN AND I GREW UP DIRT POOR,

52
00:02:09,458 --> 00:02:12,750
SO ONCE I BECAME A PRO-BENDER,
I WANTED IT ALL:

53
00:02:12,792 --> 00:02:15,375
RICHES, FAME, ACCOLADES.

54
00:02:15,417 --> 00:02:17,917
BUT ALL THAT CHANGED
WHEN I MET KORRA.

55
00:02:17,959 --> 00:02:20,125
- COME HERE.
I WANT YOU MEET MY BROTHER,

56
00:02:20,166 --> 00:02:21,166
MAKO.

57
00:02:21,208 --> 00:02:22,250
- MAKO?

58
00:02:22,291 --> 00:02:24,500
WOW, I HEARD YOU PLAY
ON THE RADIO.

59
00:02:24,542 --> 00:02:25,792
- COME ON, BOLIN, WE'RE UP.

60
00:02:25,834 --> 00:02:27,917
- WHOA, THAT WAS THE FIRST TIME
YOU MET?

61
00:02:27,959 --> 00:02:29,458
KIND OF RUDE THERE, BUDDY.

62
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:33,834
- KNOW WHAT ELSE IS RUDE?
INTERRUPTING.

63
00:02:33,875 --> 00:02:37,291
KORRA PROVED TO BE
AN AMAZING PRO-BENDER,

64
00:02:37,333 --> 00:02:38,875
AND A LOYAL FRIEND.

65
00:02:38,917 --> 00:02:44,166
SHE HELPED ME SAVE BOLIN WHEN
HE WAS TAKEN BY THE EQUALISTS.

66
00:02:44,208 --> 00:02:46,500
AFTER GOING THROUGH
SUCH A CRAZY EXPERIENCE,

67
00:02:46,542 --> 00:02:49,166
I FELT LIKE KORRA AND I
HAD A POWERFUL CONNECTION.

68
00:02:49,208 --> 00:02:51,083
- SO THEN YOU SMOOCHED HER
REAL GOOD?

69
00:02:51,125 --> 00:02:52,542
HUH? HUH?

70
00:02:52,583 --> 00:02:54,458
- NOT EXACTLY.

71
00:02:58,041 --> 00:02:59,041
AH!

72
00:02:59,083 --> 00:03:00,250
[grunting]

73
00:03:02,291 --> 00:03:03,917
- OH, NO.
I'M SO SORRY.

74
00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:04,917
I DIDN'T SEE YOU.

75
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:07,291
- HOW COULD YOU NOT SEE ME?

76
00:03:07,333 --> 00:03:09,208
I MEAN, I WAS JU--

77
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:15,875
I WAS--
I-I--WOW.

78
00:03:15,917 --> 00:03:17,208
THAT WAS--
[clears throat]

79
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:18,375
- WAIT.

80
00:03:18,417 --> 00:03:20,125
THAT WAS THE FIRST THING
YOU SAID TO ASAMI?

81
00:03:20,166 --> 00:03:22,458
YOU REALLY GOT TO WORK ON
YOUR INTRODUCTIONS.

82
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:25,000
- HEY, WHEN YOU GOT CHARM
LIKE MINE,

83
00:03:25,041 --> 00:03:27,166
YOU DON'T NEED INTRODUCTIONS.

84
00:03:27,208 --> 00:03:29,083
HANGING OUT WITH ASAMI
WAS AWESOME,

85
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:32,458
BUT IT MADE THINGS WITH KORRA...
COMPLICATED.

86
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:35,625
- SO I WAS THINKING WE SHOULD
SPEND SOME TIME TOGETHER.

87
00:03:35,667 --> 00:03:37,000
LOOK, I REALLY LIKE YOU

88
00:03:37,041 --> 00:03:41,792
AND I THINK WE WERE MEANT
FOR EACH OTHER.

89
00:03:41,834 --> 00:03:44,458
- KORRA, I'M REALLY SORRY
BUT...

90
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:47,500
I JUST DON'T FEEL THE SAME WAY
ABOUT YOU.

91
00:03:47,542 --> 00:03:49,250
- THAT'S HARSH, MAKO.

92
00:03:49,291 --> 00:03:51,834
- I KNOW, AND THE WORST PART
ABOUT IT IS,

93
00:03:51,875 --> 00:03:53,709
IT WASN'T TOTALLY TRUE.

94
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:55,667
WE NEED TO TALK.

95
00:03:55,709 --> 00:03:57,375
- SAVE YOUR BREATH.

96
00:03:57,417 --> 00:03:59,250
YOU'VE ALREADY MADE IT CLEAR
HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT ME.

97
00:03:59,291 --> 00:04:01,041
- NO, I HAVEN'T.

98
00:04:01,083 --> 00:04:02,792
WHAT I'M TRYING TO SAY IS...

99
00:04:02,834 --> 00:04:05,083
AS MUCH AS YOU DRIVE ME CRAZY,

100
00:04:05,125 --> 00:04:08,625
I ALSO THINK
YOU'RE PRETTY AMAZING.

101
00:04:08,667 --> 00:04:09,917
- HOT DOG!

102
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:11,542
SMOOCH CITY HERE WE COME.

103
00:04:11,583 --> 00:04:13,125
YOU PLAYER.

104
00:04:13,166 --> 00:04:15,041
- [slurps]
WHOA.

105
00:04:15,083 --> 00:04:16,583
I THOUGHT YOU WERE DATING ASAMI.

106
00:04:16,625 --> 00:04:18,417
- TU, GET OUT OF HERE!

107
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:21,709
- NAUGHTY MAKO.
YOU TAKE AFTER YOUR GRANDFATHER.

108
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:23,333
- GUYS, GRANDMA,

109
00:04:23,375 --> 00:04:25,166
EVERYTHING WASN'T SO CUT
AND DRY.

110
00:04:25,208 --> 00:04:27,583
I WASN'T DATING ASAMI.

111
00:04:27,625 --> 00:04:28,875
- DENIAL.

112
00:04:28,917 --> 00:04:30,917
- OKAY, MAYBE I WAS DATING HER.

113
00:04:30,959 --> 00:04:32,583
IT WAS ALL VERY CONFUSING.

114
00:04:32,625 --> 00:04:35,917
BUT MY FEELINGS FOR KORRA BECAME
CLEAR WHEN TARRLOK CAPTURED HER.

115
00:04:35,959 --> 00:04:37,625
IT FELT LIKE A PIECE OF ME
WAS GONE.

116
00:04:37,667 --> 00:04:40,458
I WAS SO WORRIED.

117
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:41,500
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

118
00:04:41,542 --> 00:04:43,208
- I'M FINE.

119
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:45,750
I'M GLAD YOU'RE HERE.

120
00:04:45,792 --> 00:04:47,291
- OOF.

121
00:04:47,333 --> 00:04:50,125
I BET ASAMI WASN'T TOO HAPPY
ABOUT THAT.

122
00:04:50,166 --> 00:04:52,834
- I'VE NOTICED
HOW YOU TREAT KORRA...

123
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:55,291
HOW YOU ACTED
WHEN SHE WAS MISSING.

124
00:04:55,333 --> 00:04:56,917
YOU HAVE FEELINGS FOR HER,
DON'T YOU?

125
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:58,750
- THINGS ARE CRAZY RIGHT NOW.

126
00:04:58,792 --> 00:05:01,166
CAN WE DEAL WITH OUR
RELATIONSHIP PROBLEMS LATER?

127
00:05:01,208 --> 00:05:02,875
- WELL, THERE MIGHT NOT BE
ANY RELATIONSHIP

128
00:05:02,917 --> 00:05:04,166
TO WORRY ABOUT LATER.

129
00:05:04,208 --> 00:05:05,750
- ASAMI!

130
00:05:05,792 --> 00:05:07,166
[sighs]

131
00:05:07,208 --> 00:05:08,083
- OUCH.

132
00:05:08,125 --> 00:05:11,125
- YUP.
TURNS OUT SHE WAS RIGHT.

133
00:05:11,166 --> 00:05:14,291
IT WAS TIME TO MAN UP
AND CALL IT QUITS.

134
00:05:14,333 --> 00:05:15,792
ASAMI,

135
00:05:15,834 --> 00:05:18,250
I'M SORRY THINGS GOT
SO MESSED UP BETWEEN US.

136
00:05:18,291 --> 00:05:20,333
BUT WHATEVER HAPPENS TODAY,

137
00:05:20,375 --> 00:05:23,000
I WANT YOU TO KNOW
HOW MUCH I CARE ABOUT YOU.

138
00:05:23,041 --> 00:05:27,417
- I CARE ABOUT YOU TOO.

139
00:05:27,458 --> 00:05:29,709
- WAIT, WAS THAT SUPPOSED TO BE
YOU BREAKING UP WITH HER?

140
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:31,417
- YES.
THAT WAS A BREAKUP.

141
00:05:31,458 --> 00:05:33,291
- DIDN'T SOUND LIKE A BREAKUP.

142
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:35,000
- IT WAS MUTUAL.
WE HAD AN UNDERSTANDING.

143
00:05:35,041 --> 00:05:36,542
WE BOTH KNEW--

144
00:05:36,583 --> 00:05:38,500
CAN I JUST GET ON WITH THE REST
OF MY STORY OR WHAT?

145
00:05:38,542 --> 00:05:39,792
- FINE.

146
00:05:39,834 --> 00:05:41,458
BUT I HOPE YOU WEREN'T
AS AMBIGUOUS WITH KORRA

147
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:42,875
AS YOU WERE WITH ASAMI.

148
00:05:42,917 --> 00:05:45,125
- TRUST ME,
I WASN'T.

149
00:05:45,166 --> 00:05:46,917
KORRA AND I ENDED UP
STOPPING AMON TOGETHER

150
00:05:46,959 --> 00:05:50,625
AND AFTER THAT, I WAS FINALLY
ABLE TO TELL HER HOW I FELT.

151
00:05:50,667 --> 00:05:52,959
EXACTLY HOW I FELT.

152
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,125
I LOVE YOU, KORRA.

153
00:06:04,625 --> 00:06:08,458
- I LOVE YOU TOO.

154
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:09,667
- AWW.

155
00:06:09,709 --> 00:06:12,417
AND THEN YOU TWO LIVED
HAPPILY EVER AFTER?

156
00:06:12,458 --> 00:06:14,000
- UM...

157
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:15,041
TENZIN'S JUST TRYING TO HELP YOU

158
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:17,333
BECOME THE BEST AVATAR
YOU CAN BE.

159
00:06:17,375 --> 00:06:18,917
- OF COURSE YOU TAKE HIS SIDE.

160
00:06:18,959 --> 00:06:20,750
- I'M NOT TAKING HIS SIDE.

161
00:06:20,792 --> 00:06:23,208
- YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES I WONDER
WHOSE SIDE YOU'RE ON.

162
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:24,959
- THERE AREN'T ANY SIDES!

163
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
- HOW COULD YOU TAKE HIS SIDE?

164
00:06:27,041 --> 00:06:28,875
- WHAT'S WITH YOU AND SIDES?

165
00:06:28,917 --> 00:06:31,041
- WELL, EXCUSE ME, OFFICER!

166
00:06:31,083 --> 00:06:33,959
DON'T LET ME STAND IN THE WAY
OF YOU WRITING TICKETS.

167
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,583
I'M JUST TRYING
TO SAVE THE WORLD!

168
00:06:35,625 --> 00:06:37,834
- WELL, I GUESS THAT IF WE'RE
BOTH PUTTING OUR JOBS FIRST,

169
00:06:37,875 --> 00:06:40,458
MAYBE THERE'S NO ROOM
FOR OUR RELATIONSHIP.

170
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,709
- SO WHAT?

171
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:44,959
ARE YOU BREAKING UP WITH ME?

172
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:50,583
- YEAH.
I GUESS I AM.

173
00:06:50,625 --> 00:06:52,625
- NOW THAT'S A BREAKUP!

174
00:06:52,667 --> 00:06:55,417
- AFTER THAT,
I DOVE INTO MY WORK.

175
00:06:55,458 --> 00:06:57,291
SOMEONE HAD BEEN TAKING OUT
SUPPLY SHIPS

176
00:06:57,333 --> 00:06:59,208
HEADING TO THE SOUTHERN WATER
TRIBE.

177
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:01,375
ASAMI'S COMPANY
WAS ONE OF THE VICTIMS,

178
00:07:01,417 --> 00:07:03,709
SO SHE AND I WORKED TOGETHER TO
CATCH THE PERPS.

179
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:07,166
THE STAKEOUT WAS THE PERFECT WAY
TO GET MY MIND OFF KORRA.

180
00:07:07,208 --> 00:07:08,834
IT WAS AN INTENSE NIGHT.

181
00:07:08,875 --> 00:07:11,834
ASAMI AND I DISCOVERED THE
TRIADS HAD DOUBLE CROSSED US.

182
00:07:11,875 --> 00:07:13,583
WE BARELY GOT AWAY,

183
00:07:13,625 --> 00:07:16,125
BUT BY THEN ASAMI'S WAREHOUSE
HAD BEEN CLEARED OUT.

184
00:07:16,166 --> 00:07:19,500
- MY COMPANY...
IT'S OVER.

185
00:07:19,542 --> 00:07:21,083
I GIVE UP.

186
00:07:21,125 --> 00:07:24,333
- WELL,
I'M NOT GIVING UP ON YOU.

187
00:07:28,375 --> 00:07:30,500
I KNOW, I KNOW.
DON'T TELL ME.

188
00:07:30,542 --> 00:07:32,417
I HAD NO RIGHT KISSING ASAMI.

189
00:07:32,458 --> 00:07:34,625
- NO, ACTUALLY,
I'M COMPLETELY FINE WITH THAT.

190
00:07:34,667 --> 00:07:36,583
YOU OFFICIALLY BROKE UP
WITH KORRA

191
00:07:36,625 --> 00:07:38,500
AND THEREFORE, YOU'RE FREE TO
SMOOCH WHOEVER YOU WISH.

192
00:07:38,542 --> 00:07:40,208
- IF ONLY IT HAD BEEN
THAT SIMPLE.

193
00:07:44,458 --> 00:07:45,333
- [moans]

194
00:07:45,375 --> 00:07:47,959
MAKO, I MISSED YOU SO MUCH!

195
00:07:50,375 --> 00:07:53,375
- KORRA,
HEY, I MISSED YOU TOO.

196
00:07:53,417 --> 00:07:55,625
SO YOU'RE NOT STILL MAD AT ME?

197
00:07:55,667 --> 00:07:59,709
WE HAD THAT FIGHT
BEFORE YOU LEFT, REMEMBER?

198
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:01,000
- NOT REALLY.

199
00:08:01,041 --> 00:08:02,709
I GOT ATTACKED BY A DARK SPIRIT

200
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:04,875
AND I LOST MY MEMORY
FOR A LITTLE WHILE.

201
00:08:04,917 --> 00:08:06,875
MAYBE IT HASN'T ALL
COME BACK YET.

202
00:08:06,917 --> 00:08:10,000
WAS IT A BAD FIGHT?

203
00:08:10,041 --> 00:08:13,917
- AHH...

204
00:08:13,959 --> 00:08:15,083
HMM...
NO.

205
00:08:15,125 --> 00:08:16,875
NO.
IT WASN'T THAT BAD.

206
00:08:16,917 --> 00:08:18,458
- WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

207
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:20,291
SO YOU WERE BACK WITH ASAMI,
BUT THEN KORRA CAME BACK

208
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:21,458
AND THOUGHT YOU GUYS
WERE STILL TOGETHER

209
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:22,959
AND YOU DIDN'T TELL HER
YOU WEREN'T?

210
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,583
- JUST LIKE YOUR GRANDFATHER.

211
00:08:24,625 --> 00:08:27,792
- WELL, ME AND ASAMI WERE NEVER
OFFICIALLY BACK TOGETHER.

212
00:08:27,834 --> 00:08:29,709
- REALLY?
THAT AGAIN?

213
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:32,625
YOU KNOW, IT SEEMS LIKE YOU'RE
SO AFRAID TO DISAPPOINT ANYONE

214
00:08:32,667 --> 00:08:35,333
THAT YOU END UP
DISAPPOINTING EVERYONE.

215
00:08:35,375 --> 00:08:38,041
- TRUER WORDS
HAVE NEVER BEEN SPOKEN.

216
00:08:38,083 --> 00:08:39,625
HIGH FIVE!

217
00:08:39,667 --> 00:08:42,041
- WELL, EVENTUALLY,
I DID TELL KORRA

218
00:08:42,083 --> 00:08:43,917
BUT BY THEN SHE ALREADY KNEW.

219
00:08:43,959 --> 00:08:46,166
- WHY DIDN'T YOU JUST TELL ME
THE TRUTH IN THE FIRST PLACE?

220
00:08:46,208 --> 00:08:48,250
- I KNOW I SHOULD HAVE,
BUT...

221
00:08:48,291 --> 00:08:50,709
I DIDN'T WANT TO HURT YOU
ALL OVER AGAIN.

222
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:53,458
I GUESS PART OF ME WANTED TO
FORGET ABOUT THE BREAKUP TOO.

223
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:56,583
- I THINK WE BOTH KNOW
THAT THIS...

224
00:08:56,625 --> 00:09:00,083
US...
DOESN'T WORK.

225
00:09:00,125 --> 00:09:02,250
- YOU'RE RIGHT.

226
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:04,125
- IT'S OVER.

227
00:09:04,166 --> 00:09:07,792
FOR REAL THIS TIME.

228
00:09:07,834 --> 00:09:11,000
- AFTER HARMONIC CONVERGENCE,
THE WORLD CHANGED.

229
00:09:11,041 --> 00:09:14,250
TEAM AVATAR TRAVELED AROUND
SEARCHING FOR NEW AIRBENDERS.

230
00:09:14,291 --> 00:09:17,709
AT FIRST, IT WAS AWKWARD
BEING AROUND KORRA AND ASAMI.

231
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:19,542
AS YOU WERE.

232
00:09:19,583 --> 00:09:21,417
LADIES.

233
00:09:25,458 --> 00:09:28,250
BUT THEN I REALIZED
I HAD TO REALIZE WHO I WAS

234
00:09:28,291 --> 00:09:29,792
WITHOUT A LADY IN MY LIFE.

235
00:09:29,834 --> 00:09:33,166
- I KNOW WHAT THAT'S LIKE.

236
00:09:33,208 --> 00:09:35,500
I MEAN, TO NEED DISTANCE
FROM WOMEN,

237
00:09:35,542 --> 00:09:38,041
BECAUSE I HAVE SO MANY
ALL OVER ME,

238
00:09:38,083 --> 00:09:39,125
ALL THE TIME.

239
00:09:39,166 --> 00:09:40,542
- ANYWAY,

240
00:09:40,583 --> 00:09:42,542
I EVENTUALLY HELPED KORRA
DEFEAT ZAHEER

241
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:45,625
AND SAVE THE AIRBENDERS
AND WE DID IT AS FRIENDS.

242
00:09:45,667 --> 00:09:48,834
KORRA SHOWED ME THE IMPORTANCE
OF PUTTING OTHERS BEFORE MYSELF.

243
00:09:48,875 --> 00:09:53,125
AND WHENEVER I THINK OF HER,
SHE CONTINUES TO INSPIRE ME.

244
00:09:53,166 --> 00:09:54,208
- WOW.

245
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:56,041
THAT STORY IS AMAZING

246
00:09:56,083 --> 00:09:57,667
AND I REALLY LEARNED SOMETHING.

247
00:09:57,709 --> 00:09:59,667
- YOU DID?
GOOD.

248
00:09:59,709 --> 00:10:02,083
- YEAH, I LEARNED THAT I REALLY
DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT YOU.

249
00:10:02,125 --> 00:10:03,500
CRAZY!

250
00:10:03,542 --> 00:10:06,041
ALSO, I REALIZED
THAT LADIES ARE COMPLICATED.

251
00:10:06,083 --> 00:10:07,083
NO OFFENSE, GRANDMA.

252
00:10:07,125 --> 00:10:08,542
- NONE TAKEN.

253
00:10:08,583 --> 00:10:10,959
- I BETTER JUST FOCUS ON
BEING A BETTER KING.

254
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,709
OKAY, COME AT ME.

255
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:14,750
I CAN TAKE IT.

256
00:10:14,792 --> 00:10:17,250
AH!
WU DOWN!

257
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:27,083
- I BROUGHT YOU SOME TEA.

258
00:10:27,125 --> 00:10:28,625
I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT BE COLD
OUT HERE.

259
00:10:28,667 --> 00:10:31,000
- YOU'RE SO SWEET.

260
00:10:31,041 --> 00:10:33,083
THANKS.

261
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:36,291
- ARE YOU OKAY?

262
00:10:36,333 --> 00:10:38,000
YOU SEEM OUT OF SORTS.

263
00:10:38,041 --> 00:10:39,709
- SORRY.

264
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:42,417
I'VE JUST BEEN THINKING ABOUT
SOMETHING TOPH SAID.

265
00:10:42,458 --> 00:10:44,625
SHE TOLD ME THAT THE WORLD
DOESN'T NEED ME

266
00:10:44,667 --> 00:10:47,458
AND IT'S BASICALLY POINTLESS
TO TRY TO STOP KUVIRA.

267
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:49,000
- THAT'S RIDICULOUS.

268
00:10:49,041 --> 00:10:50,959
- AT THE TIME,
I THOUGHT SO TOO.

269
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,250
I FIGURED SHE WAS JUST BEING
HER NORMAL, CRANKY SELF,

270
00:10:54,291 --> 00:10:56,333
BUT I'M BEGINNING TO THINK
SHE HAD A POINT.

271
00:10:56,375 --> 00:10:57,792
- NO, SHE DOESN'T.

272
00:10:57,834 --> 00:10:59,625
THE WORLD DOES NEED YOU.

273
00:10:59,667 --> 00:11:01,542
YOU'RE THE AVATAR.

274
00:11:01,583 --> 00:11:03,041
- BUT NO MATTER WHAT I DO,

275
00:11:03,083 --> 00:11:05,625
THE WORLD SEEMS TO ALWAYS
BE OUT OF BALANCE.

276
00:11:05,667 --> 00:11:08,458
GROWING UP, I COULDN'T WAIT
TO BE THE AVATAR.

277
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:11,166
I THOUGHT I WAS REALLY
GONNA CHANGE THINGS.

278
00:11:11,208 --> 00:11:13,041
I WAS SO NAIVE.

279
00:11:13,083 --> 00:11:15,625
THE FIRST TIME I SAW AMON
TAKE SOMEONE'S BENDING AWAY,

280
00:11:15,667 --> 00:11:17,959
I WAS TERRIFIED.

281
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,500
- YOUR FIREBENDING IS GONE.

282
00:11:20,542 --> 00:11:22,959
FOREVER.

283
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,959
- THEN MY WORST NIGHTMARE
CAME TRUE.

284
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,166
[groans]

285
00:11:26,208 --> 00:11:27,750
- KORRA!

286
00:11:27,792 --> 00:11:29,625
- NO!

287
00:11:29,667 --> 00:11:31,333
[gasps]

288
00:11:38,125 --> 00:11:41,458
- I TOLD YOU
I WOULD DESTROY YOU.

289
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:43,792
- KORRA, YOU'RE FORGETTING ABOUT
ALL THE GOOD THAT HAPPENED

290
00:11:43,834 --> 00:11:47,125
AFTER YOU EXPOSED AMON
AS THE FRAUD HE WAS.

291
00:11:47,166 --> 00:11:50,709
THE EQUALIST MOVEMENT
LOST ITS LEADER AND ITS POWER.

292
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:53,250
FREE ELECTIONS WERE HELD
IN THE UNITED REPUBLIC

293
00:11:53,291 --> 00:11:56,000
AND NON-BENDERS
FINALLY HAD A VOICE.

294
00:11:56,041 --> 00:12:00,250
PEOPLE HAD HOPE AGAIN
AND IT WAS ALL BECAUSE OF YOU.

295
00:12:00,291 --> 00:12:02,375
- AND I WAS HOPEFUL TOO.

296
00:12:02,417 --> 00:12:04,542
BUT THAT FEELING
DIDN'T LAST LONG.

297
00:12:04,583 --> 00:12:06,208
AS SOON AS I DEFEATED AMON,

298
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:07,709
A NEW ENEMY TOOK HIS PLACE.

299
00:12:09,792 --> 00:12:12,000
I CAN'T BELIEVE I TRUSTED YOU.

300
00:12:12,041 --> 00:12:13,875
YOU MADE ME THINK
YOU WANTED TO RESTORE BALANCE

301
00:12:13,917 --> 00:12:15,834
WITH THE SPIRITS,
BUT THIS--THIS ISN'T BALANCE.

302
00:12:15,875 --> 00:12:17,041
IT'S MADNESS!

303
00:12:17,083 --> 00:12:18,792
NOW LET HER GO.

304
00:12:18,834 --> 00:12:21,583
- IF YOU WANT YOUR FRIEND TO
MAKE IT OUT OF THE SPIRIT WORLD,

305
00:12:21,625 --> 00:12:24,208
YOU'LL OPEN THE OTHER PORTAL
NOW.

306
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:26,792
BECAUSE OF UNALAQ,
I BETRAYED TENZIN,

307
00:12:26,834 --> 00:12:28,125
OPENED THE PORTALS,

308
00:12:28,166 --> 00:12:31,208
AND THREW THE SPRIT
AND HUMAN WORLDS INTO CHAOS.

309
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:39,166
IT WAS MY FAULT HE FUSED WITH
VAATU AND BECAME A DARK AVATAR.

310
00:12:49,041 --> 00:12:51,917
AND I WAS HELPLESS TO STOP HIM
FROM DESTROYING RAAVA

311
00:12:51,959 --> 00:12:54,959
AND CUTTING OFF MY CONNECTION
TO MY PAST LIVES.

312
00:12:59,583 --> 00:13:01,125
WITH RAAVA GONE,

313
00:13:01,166 --> 00:13:04,750
UNALAQ AND VAATU BECAME MORE
POWERFUL THAN EVER.

314
00:13:08,834 --> 00:13:11,083
- BUT YOU BECAME MORE POWERFUL
TOO.

315
00:13:11,125 --> 00:13:14,792
I MEAN, YOU TURNED INTO
A GIANT SPIRIT.

316
00:13:14,834 --> 00:13:18,000
- YEAH,
THAT WAS PRETTY AWESOME.

317
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,500
- AND OPENING THE SPIRIT PORTALS
TURNED OUT TO BE A GOOD THING.

318
00:13:25,583 --> 00:13:27,166
YOU BROUGHT BACK THE AIRBENDERS

319
00:13:27,208 --> 00:13:29,542
AND CAUSE A POSITIVE SHIFT
IN THE WORLD.

320
00:13:29,583 --> 00:13:32,125
- YES, BUT ZAHEER GOT AIRBENDING
TOO,

321
00:13:32,166 --> 00:13:33,959
AND NEARLY KILLED ME.

322
00:13:41,208 --> 00:13:42,917
IF IT WEREN'T FOR ZAHEER,

323
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:45,083
THE EARTH QUEEN
WOULD STILL BE ALIVE.

324
00:13:45,125 --> 00:13:47,250
THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN NO CRISIS
IN THE EARTH KINGDOM,

325
00:13:47,291 --> 00:13:49,375
AND KUVIRA WOULDN'T BE IN POWER.

326
00:13:49,417 --> 00:13:51,500
THINGS ARE MORE OUT OF BALANCE
THAN EVER NOW.

327
00:13:51,542 --> 00:13:53,959
NOTHING'S CHANGED!

328
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,125
- YOU'RE RIGHT, KORRA.

329
00:13:55,166 --> 00:13:56,125
- I AM?

330
00:13:56,166 --> 00:13:57,709
- SHE IS?

331
00:13:57,750 --> 00:14:00,583
- IT'S TRUE, THERE WILL ALWAYS
BE NEW CONFLICTS

332
00:14:00,625 --> 00:14:02,208
AND ENEMIES TO FACE.

333
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:04,959
BUT THE IMPORTANT THING
IS TO LEARN FROM YOUR ENEMIES

334
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,083
AND BETTER YOURSELF OVER TIME,
WHICH YOU HAVE.

335
00:14:08,125 --> 00:14:10,375
YOU'VE CHANGED SO MUCH
SINCE YOU FIRST ARRIVED

336
00:14:10,417 --> 00:14:12,041
ON AIR TEMPLE ISLAND.

337
00:14:12,083 --> 00:14:14,041
WHEN YOU FIRST CAME HERE,
YOU WERE HOTHEADED

338
00:14:14,083 --> 00:14:15,750
AND A BIT SELFISH.

339
00:14:15,792 --> 00:14:18,208
BUT YOU'VE MATURED INTO
A THOUGHTFUL YOUNG WOMAN

340
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:21,041
WHO PUTS THE NEEDS OF OTHERS
BEFORE HERSELF.

341
00:14:21,083 --> 00:14:24,083
THE NEW AIR NATION
IS A TESTAMENT TO THAT.

342
00:14:24,125 --> 00:14:26,834
YOU SACRIFICED EVERYTHING
TO SAVE THEM.

343
00:14:26,875 --> 00:14:31,208
YOU'RE AN INSPIRATION
TO THE WORLD.

344
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:33,250
- THANK YOU BOTH.

345
00:14:33,291 --> 00:14:37,542
I KNOW THAT THIS KUVIRA PROBLEM
IS ONLY GOING TO GET WORSE.

346
00:14:37,583 --> 00:14:41,542
BUT NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS,
NO MATTER HOW CRAZY THINGS GET,

347
00:14:41,583 --> 00:14:44,625
I'LL ALWAYS TRY
TO RESTORE BALANCE.

348
00:14:50,917 --> 00:14:52,291
- AND THAT'S WHEN
I MADE A SOLEMN VOW

349
00:14:52,333 --> 00:14:54,625
NEVER TO EAT BARK-ONION SOUP
AGAIN.

350
00:14:54,667 --> 00:14:57,291
BEEN SIX YEARS, FOUR MONTHS,
AND 14 DAYS--

351
00:14:57,333 --> 00:14:59,625
UGH.
I CAN STILL TASTE IT.

352
00:14:59,667 --> 00:15:02,208
- DOES ANYONE ELSE FEEL LIKE
THROWING THEMSELVES OVERBOARD?

353
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:03,750
- NOT ME!

354
00:15:03,792 --> 00:15:05,333
I'VE SPENT THE LAST FEW HOURS
TUNING OUT

355
00:15:05,375 --> 00:15:07,291
ALL THESE INCREDIBLY BORING
STORIES...

356
00:15:07,333 --> 00:15:08,500
- HEY!

357
00:15:08,542 --> 00:15:10,000
- ALL THE WHILE
MENTALLY COMPOSING

358
00:15:10,041 --> 00:15:12,291
THE MOST EXCITING TALE
EVER TOLD,

359
00:15:12,333 --> 00:15:15,417
SOON BECOME THE GREATEST MOVER
EVER MADE!

360
00:15:15,458 --> 00:15:16,792
I PRESENT TO YOU NOW:

361
00:15:16,834 --> 00:15:20,125
BOLIN, AS NUKTUK,
HERO OF THE SOUTH--

362
00:15:20,166 --> 00:15:22,208
TRADEMARK VARRIMOVERS
INTERNATIONAL--

363
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:25,625
IN THE INCREDIBLE
TRUE STORY OF BOLIN!

364
00:15:25,667 --> 00:15:27,375
HERO OF THE WORLD!

365
00:15:27,417 --> 00:15:30,917
- WAIT, AM I PLAYING NUKTUK,
OR IS NUKTUK PLAYING ME?

366
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:32,333
- BOTH.

367
00:15:32,375 --> 00:15:34,291
IT'S YOUR TRUE STORY,
BUT WE'LL CAPITALIZE

368
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:36,166
ON THE AUDIENCE
OF THE NUKTUK FRANCHISE.

369
00:15:36,208 --> 00:15:37,417
DUH.

370
00:15:37,458 --> 00:15:39,750
- HOW CAN YOU CALL ME
THE HERO OF THE WORLD?

371
00:15:39,792 --> 00:15:41,500
I LEFT MY FRIENDS AND FAMILY

372
00:15:41,542 --> 00:15:43,792
TO JOIN UP WITH A PSYCHOTIC
DICTATOR WHO IMPRISONED ME,

373
00:15:43,834 --> 00:15:47,500
AND NOW I'M RUNNING BACK HOME
WITH MY TAIL BETWEEN MY LEGS.

374
00:15:47,542 --> 00:15:49,000
- NYA, BA, BA, BA, BA.

375
00:15:49,041 --> 00:15:50,417
YOU'RE EMPHASIZING
THE WRONG STORY BEATS.

376
00:15:50,458 --> 00:15:51,417
LET ME TELL IT.

377
00:15:51,458 --> 00:15:52,792
THE STORY OF BOLIN

378
00:15:52,834 --> 00:15:55,959
BEGINS IN AN EXOTIC
PORT OF CALL.

379
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,458
A WISE SAGE, THE RICHEST
MERCHANT IN THE WORLD,

380
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:01,208
AND A HANDSOME DEVIL
ALL SIT ON A SINGLE PILLOW

381
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:03,125
IN THE LIVING ROOM
OF A LUXURY YACHT.

382
00:16:03,166 --> 00:16:04,917
HOW DO THEY ALL FIT
ON ONE PILLOW?

383
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:06,250
- OOH!
GIANT PILLOW!

384
00:16:06,291 --> 00:16:07,291
- WRONG!

385
00:16:07,333 --> 00:16:10,041
THEY'RE ALL THE SAME MAN!
ME!

386
00:16:10,083 --> 00:16:12,250
I TRY TO TEACH A SWAMI
THE POWER OF LEVITATION,

387
00:16:12,291 --> 00:16:13,792
BUT HE'S TOO STUPID
TO UNDERSTAND IT,

388
00:16:13,834 --> 00:16:15,500
SO I KICK HIM OUT.

389
00:16:15,542 --> 00:16:18,583
"UPON WHOM CAN I BESTOW
MY AWESOME KNOWLEDGE?"

390
00:16:18,625 --> 00:16:20,125
I ASK MYSELF.

391
00:16:20,166 --> 00:16:23,166
THEN IN WALKS NUKTUK
WITH A TWINKLE IN HIS EYE,

392
00:16:23,208 --> 00:16:26,083
A GORGEOUS DAME ON HIS ARM,
AND A SONG ON HIS LIPS.

393
00:16:26,125 --> 00:16:28,959
HE BURSTS INTO A RAPTUROUS
MELODY--

394
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:34,583
♪ WHERE CAN I FIND
MY TEACHER? ♪

395
00:16:34,625 --> 00:16:36,041
- OH, COME ON!

396
00:16:36,083 --> 00:16:38,333
I WASN'T SINGING,
YOU WERE NOT LEVITATING.

397
00:16:38,375 --> 00:16:41,250
AND ASAMI IS JUST A FRIEND,
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

398
00:16:41,291 --> 00:16:42,959
IF YOU WANT TO TELL
MY TRUE STORY,

399
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,208
YOU SHOULD START FROM
WHEN I MET KORRA.

400
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:49,000
SHE CAME TO THE BENDING ARENA
ONE FATEFUL NIGHT...

401
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:51,834
- THIS PLACE IS EVEN MORE
AMAZING THAN I IMAGINED!

402
00:16:51,875 --> 00:16:53,083
- NAME'S BOLIN,
BY THE WAY.

403
00:16:53,125 --> 00:16:54,083
- KORRA.

404
00:16:54,125 --> 00:16:55,458
- BORING!

405
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:56,834
WHEN DOES THE SINGING START?

406
00:16:56,875 --> 00:16:58,333
- THERE WASN'T ANY SINGING.

407
00:16:58,375 --> 00:17:00,917
all: BOO!

408
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:03,041
- YOU'RE ONSCREEN TALENT, KID.

409
00:17:03,083 --> 00:17:05,333
LEAVE THE STORYTELLING
TO THE MASTERS.

410
00:17:05,375 --> 00:17:07,917
SO THE TROUBLE BEGINS
WHEN THE AVATAR

411
00:17:07,959 --> 00:17:10,333
IS TRAPPED IN THE SPIRIT WORLD.

412
00:17:10,375 --> 00:17:12,125
THE WORLD'S MOST EVIL VILLAINS
REALIZE

413
00:17:12,166 --> 00:17:13,625
THAT WITH KORRA OUT OF THE WAY,

414
00:17:13,667 --> 00:17:16,625
THE TIME IS RIGHT
TO TRY TO TAKE OUT BOLIN.

415
00:17:16,667 --> 00:17:19,083
SO THE WORST OF THE WORST
TEAM UP.

416
00:17:19,125 --> 00:17:22,917
THEY'RE LED BY ZAHEER--
LEADER OF RED LOTUS

417
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:24,125
AND MASTER OF THE SKIES!

418
00:17:24,166 --> 00:17:26,834
A FLYING CHAOTIC CHAOS MACHINE!

419
00:17:26,875 --> 00:17:28,709
HE'S JOINED BY VAATU--

420
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:32,166
THE ULTIMATE FORCE OF PURE
SPIRIT EVIL IN THE UNIVERSE!

421
00:17:32,208 --> 00:17:35,458
THE BIGGEST, MEANEST, SCARIEST
KITE THAT EVER FLEW!

422
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:37,709
- WAIT, ZAHEER DIDN'T TEAM UP
WITH VAATU.

423
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:38,875
HOW WOULD THAT EVEN HAPPEN?

424
00:17:38,917 --> 00:17:39,750
- HOW DO YOU THINK?

425
00:17:39,792 --> 00:17:42,083
[phone ringing]

426
00:17:42,125 --> 00:17:42,834
- HELLO?

427
00:17:42,875 --> 00:17:44,542
- HEY, IT'S ZAHEER.

428
00:17:44,583 --> 00:17:46,208
- OH, HEY, ZAHEER.

429
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:48,667
- GLAD I CAUGHT YOU AT HOME.
[laughs]

430
00:17:48,709 --> 00:17:50,625
- UH-HUH.
VERY FUNNY.

431
00:17:50,667 --> 00:17:52,834
LIKE I CAN LEAVE
THIS STUPID TREE.

432
00:17:52,875 --> 00:17:55,083
- HOLD ON.
LET ME CONFERENCE IN--

433
00:17:55,125 --> 00:17:55,875
- AMON!

434
00:17:55,917 --> 00:17:57,625
THE REANIMATED ZOMBIE BODY

435
00:17:57,667 --> 00:18:00,542
OF THE BLOODBENDING LEADER
OF THE EQUALISTS!

436
00:18:00,583 --> 00:18:03,041
- HEY, GUYS, I'M TOTALLY IN
FOR TAKING OUT BOLIN.

437
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:05,166
HE'S WAY TOO POWERFUL
AND AWESOME.

438
00:18:05,208 --> 00:18:07,000
BUT CAN WE PLEASE NOT INCLUDE--

439
00:18:07,041 --> 00:18:08,959
- NOT INCLUDE WHO, AMON?

440
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,709
- THE EVIL UNALAQ,

441
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:14,417
THE DIABOLICAL BUT INCREDIBLY
BORING AND UNPOPULAR SORCERER

442
00:18:14,458 --> 00:18:17,000
FROM THE NORTH, WHO'S LISTENING
IN ON THE OTHER LINE!

443
00:18:17,041 --> 00:18:19,333
- I'VE SPENT MY LIFE
TRYING TO DEFEAT NUKTUK,

444
00:18:19,375 --> 00:18:21,208
I MEAN, BOLIN,

445
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:23,125
AND I KNOW JUST WHERE
TO FIND HIM--

446
00:18:23,166 --> 00:18:25,667
WITH ALL THE BEAUTIFUL LADIES.

447
00:18:25,709 --> 00:18:27,291
- YES, BOLIN HAD A REPUTATION

448
00:18:27,333 --> 00:18:29,750
AS THE WORLD'S GREATEST
LADIES' MAN.

449
00:18:29,792 --> 00:18:32,709
- OOH, NOW THE STORY'S
GETTING INTERESTING.

450
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:35,834
- AFTER LEAVING THE BEAUTIFUL
BUT EMOTIONALLY UNSTABLE

451
00:18:35,875 --> 00:18:38,083
WATER TRIBE PRINCESS
AT THE ALTAR,

452
00:18:38,125 --> 00:18:40,208
HE MET A FETCHING AIRBENDER,

453
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:43,959
THE HEIR TO A VAST
EARTH KINGDOM FORTUNE.

454
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,875
- OPAL, SO SMART AND CARING.

455
00:18:46,917 --> 00:18:48,458
SO PRETTY TO SMELL...

456
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:51,458
AND SHE'LL PROBABLY NEVER
TALK TO ME AGAIN

457
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:53,333
BECAUSE I'M SO STUPID!

458
00:18:53,375 --> 00:18:54,417
STUPID!

459
00:18:54,458 --> 00:18:57,917
SO, SO, SO STUPID!

460
00:18:57,959 --> 00:19:00,333
- PULL IT TOGETHER,
YOU LEAKY LUG.

461
00:19:00,375 --> 00:19:03,667
BUT THE DARKEST MOMENT IS ALWAYS
RIGHT BEFORE THE DAWN.

462
00:19:03,709 --> 00:19:05,250
FOR AT HIS LOWEST POINT,

463
00:19:05,291 --> 00:19:08,375
BOLIN SOUGHT ADVICE
FROM THE MAN WHO STARTED IT ALL,

464
00:19:08,417 --> 00:19:11,125
THE WISEST OF THE WISE--
ME!

465
00:19:11,166 --> 00:19:13,709
FOR SOME OF MY SIGNATURE
SAGE ADVICE!

466
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:15,500
NUKTUK, I MEAN, BOLIN,

467
00:19:15,542 --> 00:19:17,125
THERE'S ONLY ONE THING
FOR YOU TO DO

468
00:19:17,166 --> 00:19:18,375
IF YOU WANT TO SAVE THE AVATAR

469
00:19:18,417 --> 00:19:20,208
AND DEFEAT
THE FEARSOME FOURSOME.

470
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:21,458
I'M NOT REALLY SURE
IF I LIKE "FEARSOME."

471
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:22,667
I MEAN, EVIL SQUARED
MIGHT BE BETTER.

472
00:19:22,709 --> 00:19:24,542
WHATEVER.

473
00:19:24,583 --> 00:19:26,625
YOU HAVE TO ASSEMBLE
THE FIGHTINGEST AIRBENDER ARMY

474
00:19:26,667 --> 00:19:28,375
OF ALL TIME!

475
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:30,083
BUT IT TURNS OUT THE AIRBENDER
RECRUITS ARE A SORRY LOT,

476
00:19:30,125 --> 00:19:33,000
SO BOLIN BRINGS THEM TO A SECRET
MOUNTAINTOP TRAINING FACILITY

477
00:19:33,041 --> 00:19:35,125
WHERE HE TEACHES THEM THE
ANCIENT ART OF DODGING FRUIT

478
00:19:35,166 --> 00:19:37,166
AND BALANCING ON STICKS!

479
00:19:37,208 --> 00:19:39,250
MEANWHILE,
BACK WITH ZOMBIE AMON...

480
00:19:39,291 --> 00:19:41,208
- OKAY, GUYS,
I THINK WE FINALLY DITCHED HIM.

481
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:42,917
- HA HA.
VERY FUNNY.

482
00:19:42,959 --> 00:19:44,333
I'M STILL ON THE LINE.

483
00:19:44,375 --> 00:19:47,917
SO ABOUT THAT EVIL PLAN
TO DESTROY NUKTUK...

484
00:19:47,959 --> 00:19:50,875
HELLO?
ANYONE THERE?

485
00:19:50,917 --> 00:19:53,250
GUYS!
[dial tone beeping]

486
00:19:53,291 --> 00:19:55,125
- AND WITH DANGER CLOSING IN,
OPAL REALIZES

487
00:19:55,166 --> 00:19:57,500
HOW MUCH SHE LOVES BOLIN
AND FORGIVES HIM

488
00:19:57,542 --> 00:19:59,625
FOR WHATEVER STUFF HE WAS
TALKING ABOUT EARLIER

489
00:19:59,667 --> 00:20:01,583
WHICH WILL PROBABLY NOT BE
IN THE FINAL CUT

490
00:20:01,625 --> 00:20:02,750
OF THE MOVER ANYWAY.

491
00:20:02,792 --> 00:20:03,750
- SHE DOES?

492
00:20:03,792 --> 00:20:05,834
all: AWW.

493
00:20:05,875 --> 00:20:08,333
- AND SHE KISSES BOLIN,

494
00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:11,750
MAGICALLY PASSING ON
THE AIRBENDER POWER OF FLIGHT!

495
00:20:11,792 --> 00:20:14,959
- OKAY, THAT PART SEEMS
A LITTLE UNBELIEVABLE.

496
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,208
- THIS IS NO TIME FOR THINKING,
KID.

497
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:18,125
WE'RE HEADING INTO
THE BIG FINALE!

498
00:20:18,166 --> 00:20:20,208
BOLIN GATHERS HIS AIRBENDER ARMY

499
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:22,166
TO FIGHT ALONGSIDE
ROTAN AND JUJI

500
00:20:22,208 --> 00:20:24,208
AGAINST THE TERROR SQUARE!

501
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:25,709
MAYBE THAT'S THE NAME
OF THE BAD GUYS--

502
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:28,041
TERROR SQUARE.
WHAT ABOUT LEGION OF DARKNESS?

503
00:20:28,083 --> 00:20:29,500
WELL, WE'LL PUT A FOCUS GROUP
ON IT.

504
00:20:29,542 --> 00:20:33,291
BOLIN TEACHES THE AIRBENDERS
TO CREATE A GIANT TORNADO.

505
00:20:33,333 --> 00:20:35,125
THEN HE FLIES AROUND IN THE SKY,

506
00:20:35,166 --> 00:20:36,834
PUSHES ZAHEER INTO IT,

507
00:20:36,875 --> 00:20:40,041
TURNING HIM INTO WIND
FOREVER!

508
00:20:40,083 --> 00:20:43,208
BUT BOLIN DOESN'T REALIZE THAT
THE UNIVERSAL INTERPLANETARY

509
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:46,458
COMBINATION ZERO HOUR--
TALK ABOUT A TICKING CLOCK--

510
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:48,208
IS ALMOST UPON HIM!

511
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:51,542
AND WHEN JUJI SHOOTS HIS
LASER EYES AT THE EVIL UNALAQ,

512
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:55,542
THE BEAMS ACCIDENTALLY FLY INTO
THE MAGIC SPIRIT DOORWAY!

513
00:20:55,583 --> 00:20:58,125
THEY BOUNCE OFF VAATU,
SETTING HIM FREE,

514
00:20:58,166 --> 00:21:01,333
AND HIT BOLIN,
TURNING HIM INTO A GIANT!

515
00:21:01,375 --> 00:21:04,333
BUT WHEN VAATU IS SET FREE,
THE EVIL UNALAQ,

516
00:21:04,375 --> 00:21:06,458
WHO HAS ALWAYS BEEN AN
ANNOYINGLY CLINGY PERSON,

517
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:09,041
IS SO CLOSE TO VAATU
THAT THEY COMBINE

518
00:21:09,083 --> 00:21:11,875
INTO ONE HORRIFYING MONSTER!

519
00:21:11,917 --> 00:21:15,458
GIANT BOLIN
AND THE EVIL UNAVAATU FIGHT

520
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:17,667
TOE-TO-TOE, ZAPPING EACH OTHER
WITH THEIR LASER BEAMS

521
00:21:17,709 --> 00:21:20,291
AS THEY STOMP AROUND
REPUBLIC CITY.

522
00:21:20,333 --> 00:21:23,333
IT LOOKS LIKE
THE EVIL UNAVAATU MIGHT WIN,

523
00:21:23,375 --> 00:21:26,709
BUT THANKFULLY,
BOLIN'S SPIRITUAL MOJO

524
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:31,792
IS SO STRONG THAT HE ATTRACTS
THE QUEEN OF THE FAIRIES!

525
00:21:31,834 --> 00:21:36,083
WITH HER HELP, BOLIN TURNS
UNAVAATU INTO MAGIC DUST

526
00:21:36,125 --> 00:21:38,500
AND SPRAYS HIM INTO THE SKY.

527
00:21:38,542 --> 00:21:42,083
AND THAT'S WHERE
THE STARS COME FROM.

528
00:21:42,125 --> 00:21:45,208
OH, YEAH,
AND HE TURNS INTO A DRAGON,
AND HE GOES INTO THE SPIRIT
WORLD AND SAVES THE AVATAR.

529
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:47,500
THE END!

530
00:21:47,542 --> 00:21:50,208
[applause]

531
00:21:53,125 --> 00:21:55,000
- WAIT.
YOU LIKE THAT?

532
00:21:55,041 --> 00:21:56,375
IT DIDN'T MAKE ANY SENSE!

533
00:21:56,417 --> 00:21:59,333
WHAT ABOUT ZOMBIE AMON?
WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM, HUH?

534
00:21:59,375 --> 00:22:03,208
AND-AND-AND-AND STARS
ARE MAGIC FAIRY DUST?

535
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:05,917
ARE YOU GUYS CRAZY?
ARE YOU CRAZY?

536
00:22:05,959 --> 00:22:07,917
- IT'S JUST A MOVER.
DON'T OVERTHINK IT.

537
00:22:07,959 --> 00:22:09,208
IT'S LIKE A RIDE.

538
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:11,083
- NEVER LET THE TRUTH

539
00:22:11,125 --> 00:22:12,583
GET IN THE WAY OF A GOOD STORY,
KID.
