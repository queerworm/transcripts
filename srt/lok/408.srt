1
00:00:06,954 --> 00:00:08,454
Earth.

2
00:00:08,456 --> 00:00:10,356
Fire.

3
00:00:10,358 --> 00:00:12,124
Air.

4
00:00:12,126 --> 00:00:13,426
Water.

5
00:00:13,428 --> 00:00:17,663
Only the Avatar can
master all four elements

6
00:00:17,665 --> 00:00:21,767
and bring balance to the world.

7
00:00:26,332 --> 00:00:29,521
Avatar Korra is back and
yours truly, Shiro Shinobi,

8
00:00:29,523 --> 00:00:30,755
couldn't be more thrilled.

9
00:00:30,757 --> 00:00:32,224
It's been my honor to bring you news

10
00:00:32,226 --> 00:00:34,159
of Korra and her friends over the years.

11
00:00:34,161 --> 00:00:35,293
So many heart-pounding moments!

12
00:00:35,295 --> 00:00:38,296
Who can forget Amon and
his Equalist revolution?

13
00:00:38,298 --> 00:00:39,464
I still have nightmares!

14
00:00:39,466 --> 00:00:40,398
Then there was that time

15
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:41,867
I covered the Nuktuk mover premiere.

16
00:00:41,869 --> 00:00:43,535
Boy, was that fun. But enough about me.

17
00:00:43,537 --> 00:00:46,374
Sit back, relax, and take
a trip down memory lane.

18
00:00:53,145 --> 00:00:55,881
You know, there's something
about being kidnapped

19
00:00:55,883 --> 00:00:59,384
that makes a guy realize he
needs to get his act together.

20
00:00:59,386 --> 00:01:00,652
Yeah, I agree.

21
00:01:00,654 --> 00:01:03,355
Let's toughen you up.

22
00:01:04,924 --> 00:01:07,025
Ahh! I wasn't ready!

23
00:01:07,027 --> 00:01:07,726
Wu down!

24
00:01:07,728 --> 00:01:10,996
What's going on?

25
00:01:11,899 --> 00:01:14,299
Mako, how dare you injure the prince?

26
00:01:14,301 --> 00:01:18,970
Would his royal highness
like a cherry-Berry lemonade?

27
00:01:18,972 --> 00:01:22,274
And maybe some of those
sticky dumplings too?

28
00:01:22,276 --> 00:01:23,208
Look at you.

29
00:01:23,210 --> 00:01:26,244
You're so weak, "Wu
down" is your catchphrase.

30
00:01:26,246 --> 00:01:27,679
I know, I'm a wimp.

31
00:01:27,681 --> 00:01:31,249
But it's not my fault. I was born that way.

32
00:01:31,251 --> 00:01:32,350
I'm not like you, Mako.

33
00:01:32,352 --> 00:01:35,086
I wasn't raised by a
pack of cops in the woods.

34
00:01:35,088 --> 00:01:36,721
You don't know anything about me, do you?

35
00:01:36,723 --> 00:01:39,858
Yeah, I'm drawing a blank. Why is that?

36
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:42,394
How do I not know stuff about you?

37
00:01:42,396 --> 00:01:44,362
Uh... You never asked?

38
00:01:44,364 --> 00:01:45,530
Well, I'm asking now.

39
00:01:45,532 --> 00:01:48,066
What's your favorite food?
What's your favorite color?

40
00:01:48,068 --> 00:01:50,268
Is there a special lady in your life?

41
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:52,037
Not since Korra and I broke up.

42
00:01:52,039 --> 00:01:54,272
What? You dated the Avatar? Sit.

43
00:01:54,274 --> 00:01:57,609
You and I need to have a
little gab session right now.

44
00:01:57,611 --> 00:01:58,643
How'd you guys first meet?

45
00:01:58,645 --> 00:02:01,313
Bolin and I were playing
for the fire ferrets.

46
00:02:01,315 --> 00:02:03,014
You were a pro-bender?

47
00:02:03,016 --> 00:02:03,882
Yes.

48
00:02:03,884 --> 00:02:06,117
Will you just let me tell the story?

49
00:02:06,119 --> 00:02:07,252
Carry on.

50
00:02:07,254 --> 00:02:08,420
Bolin and I grew up dirt poor,

51
00:02:08,422 --> 00:02:12,324
so once I became a
pro-bender, I wanted it all:

52
00:02:12,326 --> 00:02:14,726
Riches, fame, accolades.

53
00:02:14,728 --> 00:02:17,095
But all that changed when I met Korra.

54
00:02:17,097 --> 00:02:20,098
Come here. I want you meet my brother,

55
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:21,100
Mako.

56
00:02:21,101 --> 00:02:21,633
Mako?

57
00:02:21,635 --> 00:02:24,035
Wow, I heard you play on the radio.

58
00:02:24,037 --> 00:02:25,037
Come on, Bolin, we're up.

59
00:02:25,038 --> 00:02:27,405
Whoa, that was the first time you met?

60
00:02:27,407 --> 00:02:28,773
Kind of rude there, buddy.

61
00:02:28,775 --> 00:02:33,044
Know what else is rude? Interrupting.

62
00:02:33,046 --> 00:02:37,015
Korra proved to be an amazing pro-bender,

63
00:02:37,017 --> 00:02:37,749
and a loyal friend.

64
00:02:37,751 --> 00:02:43,288
She helped me save Bolin when
he was taken by the Equalists.

65
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:45,423
After going through
such a crazy experience,

66
00:02:45,425 --> 00:02:48,393
I felt like Korra and I
had a powerful connection.

67
00:02:48,395 --> 00:02:51,062
So then you smooched her real good?

68
00:02:51,064 --> 00:02:52,330
Huh? Huh?

69
00:02:52,332 --> 00:02:54,866
Not exactly.

70
00:02:58,070 --> 00:02:59,070
Ah!

71
00:03:01,841 --> 00:03:03,742
Oh, no. I'm so sorry.

72
00:03:03,744 --> 00:03:04,542
I didn't see you.

73
00:03:04,544 --> 00:03:07,012
How could you not see me?

74
00:03:07,014 --> 00:03:09,414
I mean, I was ju...

75
00:03:12,518 --> 00:03:15,286
I was... I-I... wow.

76
00:03:15,288 --> 00:03:17,122
That was...

77
00:03:17,124 --> 00:03:17,622
Wait.

78
00:03:17,624 --> 00:03:19,190
That was the first thing you said to Asami?

79
00:03:19,192 --> 00:03:21,826
You really got to work
on your introductions.

80
00:03:21,828 --> 00:03:24,396
Hey, when you got charm like mine,

81
00:03:24,398 --> 00:03:26,398
you don't need introductions.

82
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,199
Hanging out with Asami was awesome,

83
00:03:28,201 --> 00:03:31,503
but it made things with
Korra... Complicated.

84
00:03:31,505 --> 00:03:35,206
So I was thinking we should
spend some time together.

85
00:03:35,208 --> 00:03:36,174
Look, I really like you

86
00:03:36,176 --> 00:03:41,179
and I think we were meant for each other.

87
00:03:41,181 --> 00:03:43,748
Korra, I'm really sorry but...

88
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:47,152
I just don't feel the same way about you.

89
00:03:47,154 --> 00:03:48,586
That's harsh, Mako.

90
00:03:48,588 --> 00:03:51,589
I know, and the worst part about it is,

91
00:03:51,591 --> 00:03:53,658
it wasn't totally true.

92
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:55,326
We need to talk.

93
00:03:55,328 --> 00:03:56,328
Save your breath.

94
00:03:56,329 --> 00:03:59,097
You've already made it
clear how you feel about me.

95
00:03:59,099 --> 00:04:00,432
No, I haven't.

96
00:04:00,434 --> 00:04:02,200
What I'm trying to say is...

97
00:04:02,202 --> 00:04:04,302
As much as you drive me crazy,

98
00:04:04,304 --> 00:04:08,406
I also think you're pretty amazing.

99
00:04:08,408 --> 00:04:09,408
Hot dog!

100
00:04:09,409 --> 00:04:11,509
Smooch city here we come.

101
00:04:11,511 --> 00:04:12,844
You player.

102
00:04:12,846 --> 00:04:14,412
Whoa.

103
00:04:14,414 --> 00:04:16,181
I thought you were dating Asami.

104
00:04:16,183 --> 00:04:17,582
Tu, get out of here!

105
00:04:17,584 --> 00:04:21,619
Naughty Mako. You take
after your grandfather.

106
00:04:21,621 --> 00:04:22,821
Guys, grandma,

107
00:04:22,823 --> 00:04:24,856
everything wasn't so cut and dry.

108
00:04:24,858 --> 00:04:27,425
I wasn't dating Asami.

109
00:04:27,427 --> 00:04:28,259
Denial.

110
00:04:28,261 --> 00:04:30,395
Okay, maybe I was dating her.

111
00:04:30,397 --> 00:04:31,496
It was all very confusing.

112
00:04:31,498 --> 00:04:35,200
But my feelings for Korra became
clear when Tarrlok captured her.

113
00:04:35,202 --> 00:04:37,535
It felt like a piece of me was gone.

114
00:04:37,537 --> 00:04:40,171
I was so worried.

115
00:04:40,173 --> 00:04:41,506
Are you all right?

116
00:04:41,508 --> 00:04:42,907
I'm fine.

117
00:04:42,909 --> 00:04:45,810
I'm glad you're here.

118
00:04:45,812 --> 00:04:46,611
Oof.

119
00:04:46,613 --> 00:04:49,347
I bet Asami wasn't too happy about that.

120
00:04:49,349 --> 00:04:52,117
I've noticed how you treat Korra...

121
00:04:52,119 --> 00:04:54,686
How you acted when she was missing.

122
00:04:54,688 --> 00:04:56,554
You have feelings for her, don't you?

123
00:04:56,556 --> 00:04:57,856
Things are crazy right now.

124
00:04:57,858 --> 00:05:00,258
Can we deal with our
relationship problems later?

125
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:02,393
Well, there might not be any relationship

126
00:05:02,395 --> 00:05:04,095
to worry about later.

127
00:05:04,097 --> 00:05:05,730
Asami!

128
00:05:07,067 --> 00:05:07,565
Ouch.

129
00:05:07,567 --> 00:05:10,235
Yup. Turns out she was right.

130
00:05:10,237 --> 00:05:14,205
It was time to man up and call it quits.

131
00:05:14,207 --> 00:05:14,939
Asami,

132
00:05:14,941 --> 00:05:17,809
I'm sorry things got
so messed up between us.

133
00:05:17,811 --> 00:05:19,344
But whatever happens today,

134
00:05:19,346 --> 00:05:22,680
I want you to know how
much I care about you.

135
00:05:22,682 --> 00:05:26,217
I care about you too.

136
00:05:26,219 --> 00:05:29,154
Wait, was that supposed to
be you breaking up with her?

137
00:05:29,156 --> 00:05:30,922
Yes. That was a breakup.

138
00:05:30,924 --> 00:05:32,657
Didn't sound like a breakup.

139
00:05:32,659 --> 00:05:34,859
It was mutual. We had an understanding.

140
00:05:34,861 --> 00:05:35,627
We both knew...

141
00:05:35,629 --> 00:05:38,263
can I just get on with the
rest of my story or what?

142
00:05:38,265 --> 00:05:38,830
Fine.

143
00:05:38,832 --> 00:05:41,065
But I hope you weren't
as ambiguous with Korra

144
00:05:41,067 --> 00:05:42,400
as you were with Asami.

145
00:05:42,402 --> 00:05:44,235
Trust me, I wasn't.

146
00:05:44,237 --> 00:05:45,804
Korra and I ended up stopping Amon together

147
00:05:45,806 --> 00:05:50,275
and after that, I was finally
able to tell her how I felt.

148
00:05:50,277 --> 00:05:52,777
Exactly how I felt.

149
00:05:52,779 --> 00:05:55,580
I love you, Korra.

150
00:06:04,456 --> 00:06:08,326
I love you too.

151
00:06:08,328 --> 00:06:08,827
Aww.

152
00:06:08,829 --> 00:06:12,263
And then you two lived happily ever after?

153
00:06:12,265 --> 00:06:13,364
Um...

154
00:06:13,366 --> 00:06:14,465
Tenzin's just trying to help you

155
00:06:14,467 --> 00:06:16,835
become the best Avatar you can be.

156
00:06:16,837 --> 00:06:18,570
Of course you take his side.

157
00:06:18,572 --> 00:06:19,737
I'm not taking his side.

158
00:06:19,739 --> 00:06:22,841
You know, sometimes I
wonder whose side you're on.

159
00:06:22,843 --> 00:06:24,542
There aren't any sides!

160
00:06:24,544 --> 00:06:26,611
How could you take his side?

161
00:06:26,613 --> 00:06:28,313
What's with you and sides?

162
00:06:28,315 --> 00:06:29,948
Well, excuse me, officer!

163
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:33,218
Don't let me stand in the
way of you writing tickets.

164
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:34,519
I'm just trying to save the world!

165
00:06:34,521 --> 00:06:36,955
Well, I guess that if we're
both putting our jobs first,

166
00:06:36,957 --> 00:06:40,491
maybe there's no room for our relationship.

167
00:06:40,493 --> 00:06:42,193
So what?

168
00:06:42,195 --> 00:06:44,629
Are you breaking up with me?

169
00:06:44,631 --> 00:06:50,168
Yeah. I guess I am.

170
00:06:50,170 --> 00:06:51,970
Now that's a breakup!

171
00:06:51,972 --> 00:06:54,706
After that, I dove into my work.

172
00:06:54,708 --> 00:06:56,674
Someone had been taking out supply ships

173
00:06:56,676 --> 00:06:58,343
heading to the Southern water tribe.

174
00:06:58,345 --> 00:07:00,511
Asami's company was one of the victims,

175
00:07:00,513 --> 00:07:02,647
so she and I worked
together to catch the perps.

176
00:07:02,649 --> 00:07:06,818
The stakeout was the perfect
way to get my mind off Korra.

177
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:07,719
It was an intense night.

178
00:07:07,721 --> 00:07:11,389
Asami and I discovered the
triads had double crossed us.

179
00:07:11,391 --> 00:07:12,391
We barely got away,

180
00:07:12,392 --> 00:07:15,660
but by then Asami's warehouse
had been cleared out.

181
00:07:15,662 --> 00:07:19,497
My company... It's over.

182
00:07:19,499 --> 00:07:20,331
I give up.

183
00:07:20,333 --> 00:07:24,702
Well, I'm not giving up on you.

184
00:07:27,773 --> 00:07:29,974
I know, I know. Don't tell me.

185
00:07:29,976 --> 00:07:31,576
I had no right kissing Asami.

186
00:07:31,578 --> 00:07:33,945
No, actually, I'm
completely fine with that.

187
00:07:33,947 --> 00:07:35,413
You officially broke up with Korra

188
00:07:35,415 --> 00:07:37,849
and therefore, you're free
to smooch whoever you wish.

189
00:07:37,851 --> 00:07:40,618
If only it had been that simple.

190
00:07:44,891 --> 00:07:48,226
Mako, I missed you so much!

191
00:07:49,828 --> 00:07:52,897
Korra, hey, I missed you too.

192
00:07:52,899 --> 00:07:54,832
So you're not still mad at me?

193
00:07:54,834 --> 00:07:59,437
We had that fight before
you left, remember?

194
00:07:59,439 --> 00:08:00,305
Not really.

195
00:08:00,307 --> 00:08:01,873
I got attacked by a dark spirit

196
00:08:01,875 --> 00:08:04,108
and I lost my memory for a little while.

197
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:06,611
Maybe it hasn't all come back yet.

198
00:08:06,613 --> 00:08:09,948
Was it a bad fight?

199
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:13,751
Ahh...

200
00:08:13,753 --> 00:08:14,652
Hmm... No.

201
00:08:14,654 --> 00:08:16,621
No. It wasn't that bad.

202
00:08:16,623 --> 00:08:17,522
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

203
00:08:17,524 --> 00:08:19,357
So you were back with Asami,
but then Korra came back

204
00:08:19,359 --> 00:08:20,758
and thought you guys were still together

205
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:22,327
and you didn't tell her you weren't?

206
00:08:22,329 --> 00:08:23,528
Just like your grandfather.

207
00:08:23,530 --> 00:08:27,498
Well, me and Asami were never
officially back together.

208
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:28,566
Really? That again?

209
00:08:28,568 --> 00:08:31,836
You know, it seems like you're
so afraid to disappoint anyone

210
00:08:31,838 --> 00:08:34,439
that you end up disappointing everyone.

211
00:08:34,441 --> 00:08:37,942
Truer words have never been spoken.

212
00:08:37,944 --> 00:08:38,944
High five!

213
00:08:38,945 --> 00:08:41,579
Well, eventually, I did tell Korra

214
00:08:41,581 --> 00:08:42,747
but by then she already knew.

215
00:08:42,749 --> 00:08:45,650
Why didn't you just tell me
the truth in the first place?

216
00:08:45,652 --> 00:08:47,552
I know I should have, but...

217
00:08:47,554 --> 00:08:49,420
I didn't want to hurt you all over again.

218
00:08:49,422 --> 00:08:52,824
I guess part of me wanted to
forget about the breakup too.

219
00:08:52,826 --> 00:08:56,160
I think we both know that this...

220
00:08:56,162 --> 00:08:59,831
Us... Doesn't work.

221
00:08:59,833 --> 00:09:02,033
You're right.

222
00:09:02,035 --> 00:09:03,801
It's over.

223
00:09:03,803 --> 00:09:06,804
For real this time.

224
00:09:06,806 --> 00:09:09,807
After harmonic convergence,
the world changed.

225
00:09:09,809 --> 00:09:13,111
Team Avatar traveled around
searching for new airbenders.

226
00:09:13,113 --> 00:09:17,415
At first, it was awkward
being around Korra and Asami.

227
00:09:17,417 --> 00:09:19,550
As you were.

228
00:09:19,552 --> 00:09:21,753
Ladies.

229
00:09:24,556 --> 00:09:27,825
But then I realized I
had to realize who I was

230
00:09:27,827 --> 00:09:29,460
without a lady in my life.

231
00:09:29,462 --> 00:09:32,363
I know what that's like.

232
00:09:32,365 --> 00:09:34,832
I mean, to need distance from women,

233
00:09:34,834 --> 00:09:37,869
because I have so many all over me,

234
00:09:37,871 --> 00:09:39,037
all the time.

235
00:09:39,039 --> 00:09:39,804
Anyway,

236
00:09:39,806 --> 00:09:41,639
I eventually helped Korra defeat Zaheer

237
00:09:41,641 --> 00:09:44,509
and save the airbenders
and we did it as friends.

238
00:09:44,511 --> 00:09:47,745
Korra showed me the importance
of putting others before myself.

239
00:09:47,747 --> 00:09:53,084
And whenever I think of her,
she continues to inspire me.

240
00:09:53,086 --> 00:09:53,885
Wow.

241
00:09:53,887 --> 00:09:55,386
That story is amazing

242
00:09:55,388 --> 00:09:57,488
and I really learned something.

243
00:09:57,490 --> 00:09:58,490
You did? Good.

244
00:09:58,491 --> 00:10:02,060
Yeah, I learned that I really
didn't know anything about you.

245
00:10:02,062 --> 00:10:02,727
Crazy!

246
00:10:02,729 --> 00:10:05,797
Also, I realized that
ladies are complicated.

247
00:10:05,799 --> 00:10:06,931
No offense, grandma.

248
00:10:06,933 --> 00:10:07,765
None taken.

249
00:10:07,767 --> 00:10:10,802
I better just focus on being a better king.

250
00:10:10,804 --> 00:10:13,438
Okay, come at me.

251
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,672
I can take it.

252
00:10:14,674 --> 00:10:17,675
Ah! Wu down!

253
00:10:23,468 --> 00:10:25,135
I brought you some tea.

254
00:10:25,137 --> 00:10:28,338
I thought you might be cold out here.

255
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:30,807
You're so sweet.

256
00:10:30,809 --> 00:10:33,377
Thanks.

257
00:10:34,612 --> 00:10:35,812
Are you okay?

258
00:10:35,814 --> 00:10:37,848
You seem out of sorts.

259
00:10:37,850 --> 00:10:38,615
Sorry.

260
00:10:38,617 --> 00:10:41,518
I've just been thinking
about something Toph said.

261
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:43,553
She told me that the world doesn't need me

262
00:10:43,555 --> 00:10:46,990
and it's basically pointless
to try to stop Kuvira.

263
00:10:46,992 --> 00:10:48,392
That's ridiculous.

264
00:10:48,394 --> 00:10:49,826
At the time, I thought so too.

265
00:10:49,828 --> 00:10:53,430
I figured she was just being
her normal, cranky self,

266
00:10:53,432 --> 00:10:55,933
but I'm beginning to think she had a point.

267
00:10:55,935 --> 00:10:57,434
No, she doesn't.

268
00:10:57,436 --> 00:10:59,102
The world does need you.

269
00:10:59,104 --> 00:11:00,904
You're the Avatar.

270
00:11:00,906 --> 00:11:01,972
But no matter what I do,

271
00:11:01,974 --> 00:11:04,608
the world seems to
always be out of balance.

272
00:11:04,610 --> 00:11:07,511
Growing up, I couldn't
wait to be the Avatar.

273
00:11:07,513 --> 00:11:10,781
I thought I was really gonna change things.

274
00:11:10,783 --> 00:11:11,815
I was so naive.

275
00:11:11,817 --> 00:11:15,385
The first time I saw Amon
take someone's bending away,

276
00:11:15,387 --> 00:11:17,421
I was terrified.

277
00:11:17,423 --> 00:11:20,424
Your firebending is gone.

278
00:11:20,426 --> 00:11:22,059
Forever.

279
00:11:22,061 --> 00:11:24,795
Then my worst nightmare came true.

280
00:11:25,965 --> 00:11:27,631
Korra!

281
00:11:27,633 --> 00:11:29,499
No!

282
00:11:37,408 --> 00:11:40,110
I told you I would destroy you.

283
00:11:40,112 --> 00:11:42,813
Korra, you're forgetting about
all the good that happened

284
00:11:42,815 --> 00:11:45,916
after you exposed Amon as the fraud he was.

285
00:11:45,918 --> 00:11:49,720
The Equalist movement lost
its leader and its power.

286
00:11:49,722 --> 00:11:52,489
Free elections were held
in the united Republic

287
00:11:52,491 --> 00:11:54,825
and non-benders finally had a voice.

288
00:11:54,827 --> 00:11:59,730
People had hope again and
it was all because of you.

289
00:11:59,732 --> 00:12:01,631
And I was hopeful too.

290
00:12:01,633 --> 00:12:03,867
But that feeling didn't last long.

291
00:12:03,869 --> 00:12:05,602
As soon as I defeated Amon,

292
00:12:05,604 --> 00:12:09,139
a new enemy took his place.

293
00:12:09,141 --> 00:12:10,874
I can't I trusted you.

294
00:12:10,876 --> 00:12:12,776
You made me think you
wanted to restore balance

295
00:12:12,778 --> 00:12:15,545
with the spirits, but
this... this isn't balance.

296
00:12:15,547 --> 00:12:16,680
It's madness!

297
00:12:16,682 --> 00:12:17,514
Now let her go.

298
00:12:17,516 --> 00:12:20,784
If you want your friend to
make it out of the spirit world,

299
00:12:20,786 --> 00:12:23,220
you'll open the other portal now.

300
00:12:23,222 --> 00:12:26,423
Because of Unalaq, I betrayed Tenzin,

301
00:12:26,425 --> 00:12:27,157
opened the portals,

302
00:12:27,159 --> 00:12:31,461
and threw the spirit and
human worlds into chaos.

303
00:12:32,997 --> 00:12:39,436
It was my fault he fused with
Vaatu and became a dark Avatar.

304
00:12:47,812 --> 00:12:50,847
And I was helpless to stop
him from destroying Raava

305
00:12:50,849 --> 00:12:55,085
and cutting off my
connection to my past lives.

306
00:12:59,090 --> 00:12:59,923
With Raava gone,

307
00:12:59,925 --> 00:13:04,861
Unalaq and Vaatu became
more powerful than ever.

308
00:13:07,899 --> 00:13:10,033
But you became more powerful too.

309
00:13:10,035 --> 00:13:13,970
I mean, you turned into a giant spirit.

310
00:13:13,972 --> 00:13:18,075
Yeah, that was pretty awesome.

311
00:13:18,609 --> 00:13:23,680
And opening the spirit portals
turned out to be a good thing.

312
00:13:24,816 --> 00:13:26,116
You brought back the airbenders

313
00:13:26,118 --> 00:13:28,718
and cause a positive shift in the world.

314
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:31,655
Yes, but Zaheer got airbending too,

315
00:13:31,657 --> 00:13:34,057
and nearly killed me.

316
00:13:40,665 --> 00:13:41,965
If it weren't for Zaheer,

317
00:13:41,967 --> 00:13:43,834
the earth queen would still be alive.

318
00:13:43,836 --> 00:13:46,636
There would have been no
crisis in the earth kingdom,

319
00:13:46,638 --> 00:13:48,238
and Kuvira wouldn't be in power.

320
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:51,041
Things are more out of
balance than ever now.

321
00:13:51,043 --> 00:13:53,543
Nothing's changed!

322
00:13:53,545 --> 00:13:54,911
You're right, Korra.

323
00:13:54,913 --> 00:13:55,913
I am?

324
00:13:55,914 --> 00:13:56,713
She is?

325
00:13:56,715 --> 00:14:00,016
It's true, there will
always be new conflicts

326
00:14:00,018 --> 00:14:00,884
and enemies to face.

327
00:14:00,886 --> 00:14:03,820
But the important thing is
to learn from your enemies

328
00:14:03,822 --> 00:14:06,923
and better yourself over
time, which you have.

329
00:14:06,925 --> 00:14:09,826
You've changed so much
since you first arrived

330
00:14:09,828 --> 00:14:10,961
on air temple island.

331
00:14:10,963 --> 00:14:13,630
When you first came
here, you were hotheaded

332
00:14:13,632 --> 00:14:14,664
and a bit selfish.

333
00:14:14,666 --> 00:14:17,067
But you've matured into
a thoughtful young woman

334
00:14:17,069 --> 00:14:19,970
who puts the needs of
others before herself.

335
00:14:19,972 --> 00:14:23,073
The new air nation is a testament to that.

336
00:14:23,075 --> 00:14:25,909
You sacrificed everything to save them.

337
00:14:25,911 --> 00:14:30,814
You're an inspiration to the world.

338
00:14:30,816 --> 00:14:31,848
Thank you both.

339
00:14:31,850 --> 00:14:36,086
I know that this Kuvira problem
is only going to get worse.

340
00:14:36,088 --> 00:14:40,690
But no matter what happens,
no matter how crazy things get,

341
00:14:40,692 --> 00:14:44,794
I'll always try to restore balance.

342
00:14:50,001 --> 00:14:51,268
And that's when I made a solemn vow

343
00:14:51,270 --> 00:14:53,703
never to eat bark-onion soup again.

344
00:14:53,705 --> 00:14:56,706
Been six years, four months, and 14 days...

345
00:14:56,708 --> 00:14:58,375
ugh. I can still taste it.

346
00:14:58,377 --> 00:15:01,945
Does anyone else feel like
throwing themselves overboard?

347
00:15:01,947 --> 00:15:02,779
Not me!

348
00:15:02,781 --> 00:15:04,281
I've spent the last few hours tuning out

349
00:15:04,283 --> 00:15:07,050
all these incredibly boring stories...

350
00:15:07,052 --> 00:15:07,684
Hey!

351
00:15:07,686 --> 00:15:09,119
All the while mentally composing

352
00:15:09,121 --> 00:15:11,421
the most exciting tale ever told,

353
00:15:11,423 --> 00:15:14,891
soon become the greatest mover ever made!

354
00:15:14,893 --> 00:15:15,893
I present to you now:

355
00:15:15,894 --> 00:15:19,329
Bolin, as Nuktuk, here of the South...

356
00:15:19,331 --> 00:15:21,231
trademark Varrimovers International...

357
00:15:21,233 --> 00:15:25,135
in the incredible true story of Bolin!

358
00:15:25,137 --> 00:15:26,336
Hero of the world!

359
00:15:26,338 --> 00:15:30,740
Wait, am I playing Nuktuk,
or is Nuktuk playing me?

360
00:15:30,742 --> 00:15:31,441
Both.

361
00:15:31,443 --> 00:15:33,276
It's your true story, but we'll capitalize

362
00:15:33,278 --> 00:15:36,012
on the audience of the Nuktuk franchise.

363
00:15:36,014 --> 00:15:36,479
Duh.

364
00:15:36,481 --> 00:15:39,082
How can you call me the hero of the world?

365
00:15:39,084 --> 00:15:40,150
I left my friends and family

366
00:15:40,152 --> 00:15:42,519
to join up with a psychotic
dictator who imprisoned me,

367
00:15:42,521 --> 00:15:46,990
and now I'm running back home
with my tail between my legs.

368
00:15:46,992 --> 00:15:48,024
Nya, Ba, Ba, Ba, Ba.

369
00:15:48,026 --> 00:15:50,026
You're emphasizing the wrong story beats.

370
00:15:50,028 --> 00:15:50,994
Let me tell it.

371
00:15:50,996 --> 00:15:51,962
The story of Bolin

372
00:15:51,964 --> 00:15:54,931
begins in an exotic port of call.

373
00:15:54,933 --> 00:15:57,500
A wise sage, the richest
merchant in the world,

374
00:15:57,502 --> 00:16:00,403
and a handsome devil all
sit on a single pillow

375
00:16:00,405 --> 00:16:02,372
in the living room of a luxury yacht.

376
00:16:02,374 --> 00:16:04,441
How do they all fit on one pillow?

377
00:16:04,443 --> 00:16:06,009
Ooh! Giant pillow!

378
00:16:06,011 --> 00:16:06,610
Wrong!

379
00:16:06,612 --> 00:16:08,945
They're all the same man! Me!

380
00:16:08,947 --> 00:16:11,448
I try to teach a swami
the power of levitation,

381
00:16:11,450 --> 00:16:13,450
but he's too stupid to understand it,

382
00:16:13,452 --> 00:16:14,284
so I kick him out.

383
00:16:14,286 --> 00:16:18,154
"Upon whom can I bestow
my awesome knowledge?"

384
00:16:18,156 --> 00:16:18,989
I ask myself.

385
00:16:18,991 --> 00:16:21,925
Then in walks Nuktuk
with a twinkle in his eye,

386
00:16:21,927 --> 00:16:25,395
a gorgeous dame on his
arm, and a song on his lips.

387
00:16:25,397 --> 00:16:28,064
He bursts into a rapturous melody...

388
00:16:28,066 --> 00:16:34,170
♪ Where can I find my teacher? ♪

389
00:16:34,172 --> 00:16:35,071
Oh, come on!

390
00:16:35,073 --> 00:16:37,340
I wasn't singing, you were not levitating.

391
00:16:37,342 --> 00:16:40,310
And Asami is just a
friend, thank you very much.

392
00:16:40,312 --> 00:16:42,012
If you want to tell my true story,

393
00:16:42,014 --> 00:16:44,014
you should start from when I met Korra.

394
00:16:44,016 --> 00:16:48,051
She came to the bending
arena one fateful night...

395
00:16:48,053 --> 00:16:51,087
This place is even more
amazing than I imagined!

396
00:16:51,089 --> 00:16:52,922
Name's Bolin, by the way.

397
00:16:52,924 --> 00:16:53,890
Korra.

398
00:16:53,892 --> 00:16:54,858
Boring!

399
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:56,359
When does the singing start?

400
00:16:56,361 --> 00:16:58,094
There wasn't any singing.

401
00:16:58,096 --> 00:17:00,330
Boo!

402
00:17:00,332 --> 00:17:02,032
You're onscreen talent, kid.

403
00:17:02,034 --> 00:17:04,267
Leave the storytelling to the masters.

404
00:17:04,269 --> 00:17:07,103
So the trouble begins when the Avatar

405
00:17:07,105 --> 00:17:09,272
is trapped in the spirit world.

406
00:17:09,274 --> 00:17:11,474
The world's most evil villains realize

407
00:17:11,476 --> 00:17:12,676
that with Korra out of the way,

408
00:17:12,678 --> 00:17:15,845
the time is right to try to take out Bolin.

409
00:17:15,847 --> 00:17:17,981
So the worst of the worst team up.

410
00:17:17,983 --> 00:17:22,285
They're led by Zaheer...
leader of red lotus

411
00:17:22,287 --> 00:17:23,486
and master of the skies!

412
00:17:23,488 --> 00:17:26,222
A flying chaotic chaos machine!

413
00:17:26,224 --> 00:17:27,524
He's joined by Vaatu...

414
00:17:27,526 --> 00:17:30,960
the ultimate force of pure
spirit evil in the universe!

415
00:17:30,962 --> 00:17:34,531
The biggest, meanest,
scariest kite that ever flew!

416
00:17:34,533 --> 00:17:37,033
Wait, Zaheer didn't team up with Vaatu.

417
00:17:37,035 --> 00:17:38,301
How would that even happen?

418
00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:39,469
How do you think?

419
00:17:41,907 --> 00:17:42,472
Hello?

420
00:17:42,474 --> 00:17:44,074
Hey, it's Zaheer.

421
00:17:44,076 --> 00:17:45,475
Oh, hey, Zaheer.

422
00:17:45,477 --> 00:17:48,078
Glad I caught you at home.

423
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:49,879
Uh-huh. Very funny.

424
00:17:49,881 --> 00:17:52,015
Like I can leave this stupid tree.

425
00:17:52,017 --> 00:17:54,884
Hold on. Let me conference in...

426
00:17:54,886 --> 00:17:55,385
Amon!

427
00:17:55,387 --> 00:17:56,686
The reanimated zombie body

428
00:17:56,688 --> 00:17:59,422
of the bloodbending
leader of the Equalists!

429
00:17:59,424 --> 00:18:02,292
Hey, guys, I'm totally
in for taking out Bolin.

430
00:18:02,294 --> 00:18:04,494
He's way too powerful and awesome.

431
00:18:04,496 --> 00:18:06,529
But can we please not include...

432
00:18:06,531 --> 00:18:08,565
not include who, Amon?

433
00:18:08,567 --> 00:18:09,399
The evil Unalaq,

434
00:18:09,401 --> 00:18:13,069
the diabolical but incredibly
boring and unpopular sorcerer

435
00:18:13,071 --> 00:18:16,239
from the north, who's
listening in on the other line!

436
00:18:16,241 --> 00:18:19,242
I've spent my life trying to defeat Nuktuk,

437
00:18:19,244 --> 00:18:20,210
I mean, Bolin,

438
00:18:20,212 --> 00:18:22,512
and I know just where to find him...

439
00:18:22,514 --> 00:18:24,948
with all the beautiful ladies.

440
00:18:24,950 --> 00:18:26,282
Yes, Bolin had a reputation

441
00:18:26,284 --> 00:18:28,752
as the world's greatest ladies' man.

442
00:18:28,754 --> 00:18:31,554
Ooh, now the story's getting interesting.

443
00:18:31,556 --> 00:18:34,958
After leaving the beautiful
but emotionally unstable

444
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:37,527
water tribe princess at the altar,

445
00:18:37,529 --> 00:18:39,162
he met a fetching airbender,

446
00:18:39,164 --> 00:18:43,233
the heir to a vast earth kingdom fortune.

447
00:18:43,235 --> 00:18:46,269
Opal, so smart and caring.

448
00:18:46,271 --> 00:18:47,604
So pretty to smell...

449
00:18:47,606 --> 00:18:50,940
And she'll probably never talk to me again

450
00:18:50,942 --> 00:18:53,076
because I'm so stupid!

451
00:18:53,078 --> 00:18:53,977
Stupid!

452
00:18:53,979 --> 00:18:57,046
So, so, so stupid!

453
00:18:57,048 --> 00:18:59,015
Pull it together, you leaky lug.

454
00:18:59,017 --> 00:19:03,052
But the darkest moment is
always right before the dawn.

455
00:19:03,054 --> 00:19:03,987
For at his lowest point,

456
00:19:03,989 --> 00:19:07,690
Bolin sought advice from
the man who started it all,

457
00:19:07,692 --> 00:19:10,160
the wisest of the wise... me!

458
00:19:10,162 --> 00:19:13,296
For some of my signature sage advice!

459
00:19:13,298 --> 00:19:14,631
Nuktuk, I mean, Bolin,

460
00:19:14,633 --> 00:19:16,499
there's only one thing for you to do

461
00:19:16,501 --> 00:19:17,600
if you want to save the Avatar

462
00:19:17,602 --> 00:19:19,169
and defeat the fearsome foursome.

463
00:19:19,171 --> 00:19:20,503
I'm not really sure if I like "fearsome."

464
00:19:20,505 --> 00:19:22,505
I mean, evil squared might be better.

465
00:19:22,507 --> 00:19:23,239
Whatever.

466
00:19:23,241 --> 00:19:26,209
You have to assemble the
fightingest airbender army

467
00:19:26,211 --> 00:19:27,043
of all time!

468
00:19:27,045 --> 00:19:28,711
But it turns out the airbender
recruits are a sorry lot,

469
00:19:28,713 --> 00:19:31,781
so Bolin brings them to a secret
mountaintop training facility

470
00:19:31,783 --> 00:19:34,651
where he teaches them the
ancient art of dodging fruit

471
00:19:34,653 --> 00:19:36,453
and balancing on sticks!

472
00:19:36,455 --> 00:19:38,087
Meanwhile, back with zombie Amon...

473
00:19:38,089 --> 00:19:40,723
Okay, guys, I think we finally ditched him.

474
00:19:40,725 --> 00:19:42,292
Ha ha. Very funny.

475
00:19:42,294 --> 00:19:43,193
I'm still on the line.

476
00:19:43,195 --> 00:19:47,464
So about that evil plan
to destroy Nuktuk...

477
00:19:47,466 --> 00:19:50,133
Hello? Anyone there?

478
00:19:50,135 --> 00:19:52,135
Guys!

479
00:19:52,137 --> 00:19:54,370
And with danger closing in, Opal realizes

480
00:19:54,372 --> 00:19:56,506
how much she loves Bolin and forgives him

481
00:19:56,508 --> 00:19:58,708
for whatever stuff he
was talking about earlier

482
00:19:58,710 --> 00:20:01,077
which will probably not be in the final cut

483
00:20:01,079 --> 00:20:02,545
of the mover anyway.

484
00:20:02,547 --> 00:20:03,613
She does?

485
00:20:03,615 --> 00:20:05,415
Aww.

486
00:20:05,417 --> 00:20:07,116
And she kisses Bolin,

487
00:20:07,118 --> 00:20:10,720
magically passing on the
airbender power of flight!

488
00:20:10,722 --> 00:20:14,057
Okay, that part seems
a little unbelievable.

489
00:20:14,059 --> 00:20:15,492
This is no time for thinking, kid.

490
00:20:15,494 --> 00:20:17,560
We're heading into the big finale!

491
00:20:17,562 --> 00:20:19,329
Bolin gathers his airbender army

492
00:20:19,331 --> 00:20:21,664
to fight alongside Rotan and Juji

493
00:20:21,666 --> 00:20:23,233
against the Terror Square!

494
00:20:23,235 --> 00:20:24,734
Maybe that's the name of the bad guys...

495
00:20:24,736 --> 00:20:27,136
Terror Square. What
about legion of darkness?

496
00:20:27,138 --> 00:20:28,404
Well, we'll put a focus group on it.

497
00:20:28,406 --> 00:20:32,709
Bolin teaches the airbenders
to create a giant tornado.

498
00:20:32,711 --> 00:20:34,711
Then he flies around in the sky,

499
00:20:34,713 --> 00:20:36,112
pushes Zaheer into it,

500
00:20:36,114 --> 00:20:38,781
turning him into wind forever!

501
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:42,018
But Bolin doesn't realize that
the universal interplanetary

502
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:46,022
combination zero hour...
talk about a ticking clock...

503
00:20:46,024 --> 00:20:47,024
is almost upon him!

504
00:20:47,025 --> 00:20:50,226
And when Juji shoots his
laser eyes at the evil Unalaq,

505
00:20:50,228 --> 00:20:54,731
the beams accidentally fly
into the magic spirit doorway!

506
00:20:54,733 --> 00:20:57,200
They bounce off Vaatu, setting him free,

507
00:20:57,202 --> 00:21:00,436
and hit Bolin, turning him into a giant!

508
00:21:00,438 --> 00:21:03,172
But when Vaatu is set
free, the evil Unalaq,

509
00:21:03,174 --> 00:21:05,642
who has always been an
annoyingly clingy person,

510
00:21:05,644 --> 00:21:08,511
is so close to Vaatu that they combine

511
00:21:08,513 --> 00:21:10,914
into one horrifying monster!

512
00:21:10,916 --> 00:21:14,183
Giant Bolin and the evil Unavaatu fight

513
00:21:14,185 --> 00:21:16,853
toe-to-toe, zapping each
other with their laser beams

514
00:21:16,855 --> 00:21:19,222
as they stomp around Republic City.

515
00:21:19,224 --> 00:21:22,325
It looks like the evil Unavaatu might win,

516
00:21:22,327 --> 00:21:25,562
but thankfully, Bolin's spiritual mojo

517
00:21:25,564 --> 00:21:30,733
is so strong that he attracts
the queen of the fairies!

518
00:21:30,735 --> 00:21:35,572
With her help, Bolin turns
Unavaatu into magic dust

519
00:21:35,574 --> 00:21:37,740
and sprays him into the sky.

520
00:21:37,742 --> 00:21:41,177
And that's where the stars come from.

521
00:21:41,179 --> 00:21:42,445
Oh, yeah, and he turns into a dragon,

522
00:21:42,447 --> 00:21:46,049
and he goes into the spirit
world and saves the Avatar.

523
00:21:46,051 --> 00:21:48,217
The end!

524
00:21:52,623 --> 00:21:54,591
Wait. You like that?

525
00:21:54,593 --> 00:21:55,692
It didn't make any sense!

526
00:21:55,694 --> 00:21:58,261
What about zombie Amon?
What happened to him, huh?

527
00:21:58,263 --> 00:22:02,265
And-and-and-and stars
are magic fairy dust?

528
00:22:02,267 --> 00:22:04,934
Are you guys crazy? Are you crazy?

529
00:22:04,936 --> 00:22:07,604
It's just a mover. Don't overthink it.

530
00:22:07,606 --> 00:22:08,738
It's like a ride.

531
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:10,139
Never let the truth

532
00:22:10,141 --> 00:22:13,776
get in the way of a good story, kid.
