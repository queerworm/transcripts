1
00:00:01,459 --> 00:00:03,293
Earth.

2
00:00:03,378 --> 00:00:04,962
Fire.

3
00:00:05,046 --> 00:00:06,880
Air.

4
00:00:06,965 --> 00:00:08,215
Water.

5
00:00:08,967 --> 00:00:12,970
Only the Avatar can master
all four elements

6
00:00:12,971 --> 00:00:15,723
and bring baIance to the world.

7
00:00:21,271 --> 00:00:22,980
Benders, be on alert!

8
00:00:22,981 --> 00:00:25,983
After coming face to face with Amon,
Ieader of the EquaIists,

9
00:00:25,984 --> 00:00:29,069
Avatar Korra discovers a terrifying truth!

10
00:00:29,154 --> 00:00:32,948
This masked madman has the abiIity
to take away a person's bending,

11
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:34,158
permanentIy!

12
00:00:34,242 --> 00:00:37,786
Benders of Republic City
are counting on their young Avatar.

13
00:00:37,871 --> 00:00:40,998
But is she prepared to face
such a frightening foe?

14
00:01:19,037 --> 00:01:22,039
After l take your bending away,

15
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:24,249
you will be nothing!

16
00:01:32,592 --> 00:01:35,052
lt's all right, Naga.

17
00:01:36,346 --> 00:01:38,138
l just had a bad dream.

18
00:01:41,559 --> 00:01:44,061
There is a madman running around
our beloved city,

19
00:01:44,145 --> 00:01:46,063
threatening to tear it apart.

20
00:01:46,064 --> 00:01:47,981
We need to create a task force

21
00:01:48,066 --> 00:01:52,361
whose sole mission is to find Amon
and bring him to justice.

22
00:01:52,445 --> 00:01:53,821
Absolutely not.

23
00:01:53,905 --> 00:01:57,491
A move that aggressive would only
further divide benders and non-benders.

24
00:01:57,575 --> 00:02:01,078
Tarrlok, l'm inclined to agree
with your proposal.

25
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:04,081
But who would even head up
such a task force?

26
00:02:04,082 --> 00:02:08,919
lt would be my honor
and privilege to accept such a duty.

27
00:02:09,003 --> 00:02:12,506
This is just another one of your ploys
to gain more power, isn't it?

28
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:16,093
All l'm trying to do is help. Think back.

29
00:02:16,094 --> 00:02:17,261
Forty-two years ago,

30
00:02:17,345 --> 00:02:20,597
Republic City was threatened
by another dangerous man,

31
00:02:20,682 --> 00:02:22,015
Yakone.

32
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:24,893
Your father wasn't afraid
to deal with him head on.

33
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:27,146
This is a completely different situation.

34
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:30,607
And how dare you compare
yourself to Avatar Aang!

35
00:02:31,109 --> 00:02:35,279
Amon is not going to stop
with the bending Triads.

36
00:02:35,363 --> 00:02:37,948
Eventually he will come
for all us benders,

37
00:02:38,032 --> 00:02:40,367
our friends, our families.

38
00:02:40,451 --> 00:02:45,455
Vote for this task force
and l will stop Amon before it's too late.

39
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:47,124
All in favor?

40
00:03:06,144 --> 00:03:08,896
Good evening, my fellow Equalists.

41
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:11,815
This is your Ieader, Amon.

42
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:14,109
As you have heard,
the Republic Council has voted

43
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:17,154
to make me pubIic enemy number one,

44
00:03:17,155 --> 00:03:20,407
proving once again that
the bending oppressors of this city

45
00:03:20,491 --> 00:03:23,577
wiII stop at nothing
to quash our revoIution.

46
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:29,166
But we cannot be stopped,
our numbers grow stronger by the day.

47
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:33,003
You no Ionger have to Iive in fear.

48
00:03:33,254 --> 00:03:34,922
The time has come

49
00:03:35,006 --> 00:03:37,549
for benders to experience fear.

50
00:03:54,609 --> 00:03:57,194
No! l'm so sorry! l didn't see you!

51
00:03:57,195 --> 00:03:59,196
How could you not see me?

52
00:03:59,197 --> 00:04:00,906
l mean, l was...

53
00:04:04,994 --> 00:04:08,205
l was, l... l... That was...

54
00:04:09,165 --> 00:04:12,834
Are you okay? Did l hurt you?
l am such an idiot.

55
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:14,628
Don't worry, l'm fine.

56
00:04:14,712 --> 00:04:17,881
My brother hits me harder than that
every day in practice.

57
00:04:18,216 --> 00:04:21,510
Wait, l recognize you.
You're Mako, right?

58
00:04:22,053 --> 00:04:23,971
You play for the Fire Ferrets!

59
00:04:24,055 --> 00:04:26,098
Yeah, that's me.

60
00:04:26,182 --> 00:04:28,225
l am so embarrassed!

61
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:30,227
My name's Asami.

62
00:04:30,228 --> 00:04:32,229
Let me make this up to you somehow.

63
00:04:34,065 --> 00:04:35,399
How about l treat you to dinner?

64
00:04:35,483 --> 00:04:38,235
Tomorrow night, 8:00, Kwong's Cuisine.

65
00:04:39,237 --> 00:04:40,404
Kwong's?

66
00:04:40,488 --> 00:04:43,657
l don't have any clothes nice enough
for a place that classy.

67
00:04:43,741 --> 00:04:47,202
l'll take care of that.
All you need to do is show up.

68
00:04:47,537 --> 00:04:49,705
So, it's a date?

69
00:04:50,748 --> 00:04:54,251
Yeah, l guess so.
l'll see you tomorrow night.

70
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:10,017
We are grateful for this delicious food,

71
00:05:10,101 --> 00:05:12,394
for happiness, for compassion and...

72
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:14,855
l'm not interrupting, am l?

73
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:18,942
This is my home, Tarrlok.

74
00:05:19,027 --> 00:05:20,277
We're about to eat dinner.

75
00:05:20,278 --> 00:05:23,405
Good, because
l am absolutely famished.

76
00:05:24,282 --> 00:05:27,576
Airbenders never turn away
a hungry guest, am l right?

77
00:05:28,411 --> 00:05:29,828
l suppose.

78
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:38,086
You must be the famous Avatar Korra.

79
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:40,464
lt is truly an honor.

80
00:05:40,548 --> 00:05:42,299
l am Councilman Tarrlok,

81
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:44,426
representative
from the Northern Water Tribe.

82
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:45,802
Nice to meet you.

83
00:05:48,306 --> 00:05:50,015
Why do you have three ponytails?

84
00:05:50,099 --> 00:05:52,309
And how come you smell
like a lady? You're weird.

85
00:05:52,393 --> 00:05:54,478
Well, aren't you

86
00:05:54,562 --> 00:05:55,937
precocious?

87
00:05:56,564 --> 00:06:00,359
So, l've been reading all
about your adventures in the papers.

88
00:06:00,443 --> 00:06:02,235
lnfiltrating Amon's rally,

89
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:04,571
now, that took some real initiative.

90
00:06:05,448 --> 00:06:08,784
Thanks. l think you're the first
authority figure in this city

91
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:10,327
who's happy l'm here.

92
00:06:10,328 --> 00:06:13,872
Republic City is much better off
now that you've arrived.

93
00:06:13,956 --> 00:06:16,291
Enough with the flattery, Tarrlok.

94
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:17,959
What do you want from Korra?

95
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:20,587
Patience, Tenzin, l'm getting to that.

96
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:22,964
As you may have heard,

97
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:25,092
l am assembling a task force

98
00:06:25,176 --> 00:06:27,344
that will strike at the heart
of the revolution,

99
00:06:27,345 --> 00:06:29,137
and l want you to join me.

100
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:30,597
-Really?
-What?

101
00:06:30,681 --> 00:06:33,850
l need someone who will help me
attack Amon directly,

102
00:06:33,935 --> 00:06:36,353
someone who is fearless
in the face of danger,

103
00:06:36,437 --> 00:06:39,356
and that someone is you.

104
00:06:39,732 --> 00:06:41,274
Join your task force?

105
00:06:42,527 --> 00:06:43,693
l can't.

106
00:06:54,372 --> 00:06:57,749
l must admit, l'm rather surprised.

107
00:06:57,834 --> 00:06:59,459
l thought you'd jump at the chance

108
00:06:59,544 --> 00:07:01,586
to help me lead the charge
against Amon.

109
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:02,838
Me, too.

110
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:07,134
l came to Republic City to finish
my Avatar training with Tenzin.

111
00:07:07,218 --> 00:07:09,386
Right now, l just need to focus on that.

112
00:07:09,387 --> 00:07:12,347
Which is why this opportunity is perfect.

113
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:14,224
You would get on-the-job experience

114
00:07:14,308 --> 00:07:17,394
while performing
your Avatar duty for the city.

115
00:07:17,395 --> 00:07:20,480
Korra gave you her answer.
lt's time for you to go.

116
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:26,194
Very well.
But l'm not giving up on you just yet.

117
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:28,071
You'll be hearing from me soon.

118
00:07:28,156 --> 00:07:30,449
lt has been a pleasure, Avatar Korra.

119
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:34,286
Bye-bye, ponytail man!

120
00:07:43,421 --> 00:07:46,423
Welcome to Kwong's Cuisine,
Master Mako.

121
00:07:46,674 --> 00:07:48,133
"Master"?

122
00:08:01,606 --> 00:08:03,523
The scarf stays.

123
00:08:05,276 --> 00:08:07,652
As you wish, sir. This way, please.

124
00:08:12,283 --> 00:08:14,576
l am such a big Pro-bending fan.

125
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:16,536
l caught all of your matches this season.

126
00:08:16,621 --> 00:08:18,371
All of them?

127
00:08:19,123 --> 00:08:21,583
Honestly, there were a few
l wish you hadn't seen.

128
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:24,461
Don't be ridiculous. You're amazing!

129
00:08:24,545 --> 00:08:26,463
l can't wait to see
you play in the tournament.

130
00:08:26,464 --> 00:08:29,216
Yeah, well... Maybe next year.

131
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:31,468
What do you mean? You made it in.

132
00:08:31,469 --> 00:08:33,470
lt just isn't in the cards for us right now.

133
00:08:35,139 --> 00:08:37,182
Tell me, what's the problem?

134
00:08:38,601 --> 00:08:41,561
We don't have the cash to ante up
for the championship pot.

135
00:08:42,146 --> 00:08:45,315
So, it looks like we're out of the running.

136
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:46,900
That's not fair.

137
00:08:47,693 --> 00:08:50,695
Pardon me, Miss Sato.
Your main course.

138
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:53,740
Miss Sato?

139
00:08:53,824 --> 00:08:56,826
You wouldn't happen to be related
to Hiroshi Sato,

140
00:08:56,911 --> 00:08:58,495
creator of the Sato-mobile?

141
00:08:58,496 --> 00:09:00,747
-Yeah, he's my dad.
-Get out of town!

142
00:09:00,831 --> 00:09:03,375
l'm serious. You want to meet him?

143
00:09:04,168 --> 00:09:08,171
Meet the most successful captain
of industry in all of Republic City?

144
00:09:08,256 --> 00:09:10,090
Yeah, l'll take you up on that.

145
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:15,262
Hello, fellow teammate!

146
00:09:15,346 --> 00:09:16,930
Hey, Bolin.

147
00:09:17,014 --> 00:09:18,515
Missed you at practice this week.

148
00:09:18,516 --> 00:09:20,600
Yeah, sorry about that.

149
00:09:20,685 --> 00:09:23,520
lt's all right. We're probably out
of the tournament anyway,

150
00:09:23,521 --> 00:09:26,565
unless some money miraculously
drops out of the sky by tomorrow.

151
00:09:27,316 --> 00:09:29,943
Anyway, reason l came by
was to give you this.

152
00:09:31,529 --> 00:09:33,530
Thanks. What's this for?

153
00:09:34,448 --> 00:09:36,533
l can't remember now.
Yeah, now l remember.

154
00:09:36,534 --> 00:09:38,535
You saved me from Amon.

155
00:09:38,536 --> 00:09:40,996
That? lt was no big deal.

156
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,582
No big deal? Are you serious?
l was totally freaking out

157
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:45,542
when he was coming at me
with his creepy mask, all,

158
00:09:45,626 --> 00:09:48,420
"l will take away your bending forever!"

159
00:09:48,504 --> 00:09:51,756
l mean, that is scary stuff.
l still can't sleep well.

160
00:09:53,175 --> 00:09:55,218
Delivery for Avatar Korra!

161
00:09:57,096 --> 00:10:00,682
Tarrlok sends his compliments
and urges you to reconsider his offer.

162
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:03,393
Tell him l haven't changed my mind.

163
00:10:05,563 --> 00:10:08,565
Who's this Tarrlok guy?
ls he bothering you?

164
00:10:08,566 --> 00:10:10,483
'Cause l could have a word with him.

165
00:10:11,319 --> 00:10:13,111
No, it's not like that.

166
00:10:13,195 --> 00:10:16,531
He's just some old guy
who works with Tenzin on the Council.

167
00:10:17,199 --> 00:10:20,368
Good, good. That sounds better.
l like that better.

168
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:28,960
What do you think
of my little operation here?

169
00:10:29,045 --> 00:10:31,796
lt's very impressive, Mr. Sato.

170
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:33,590
Please, call me Hiroshi.

171
00:10:33,674 --> 00:10:36,885
-So, l understand you're dirt poor.
-Well...

172
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:39,596
Young man,
it is nothing to be ashamed of.

173
00:10:39,597 --> 00:10:42,307
l, too, came from humble beginnings.

174
00:10:42,391 --> 00:10:46,311
Why, when l was your age,
l was a mere shoe shiner.

175
00:10:46,395 --> 00:10:48,980
And all l had to my name was an idea...

176
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:51,566
The Sato-mobile.

177
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:54,611
Now, l was fortunate enough
to meet someone

178
00:10:54,612 --> 00:10:57,238
who believed in me and my work ethic.

179
00:10:57,323 --> 00:11:01,034
He gave me the money l needed
to get my idea off the ground.

180
00:11:01,118 --> 00:11:04,162
And l built
the entire Future lndustries empire

181
00:11:04,246 --> 00:11:07,624
from that one, selfless loan.

182
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:10,627
Dad, stop bragging.
Just tell Mako the good news.

183
00:11:11,837 --> 00:11:13,546
What good news?

184
00:11:13,631 --> 00:11:17,217
Well, my daughter passionately told me
all about your hard-earned success

185
00:11:17,301 --> 00:11:19,010
in the Pro-bending Arena,

186
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:23,598
and about your team's current
financial stumbling block.

187
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:25,600
Now l'd hate to see you lose
your chance

188
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:27,519
at winning the championship,

189
00:11:27,603 --> 00:11:29,729
just because you're short a few yuans.

190
00:11:29,814 --> 00:11:33,650
That's why l'm going to sponsor
the Fire Ferrets in the tournament!

191
00:11:33,734 --> 00:11:36,236
-Are you serious?
-He's serious!

192
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,822
My dad's going to cover your ante
for the championship pot.

193
00:11:38,906 --> 00:11:41,074
That... That is good news!

194
00:11:41,158 --> 00:11:43,118
There's just one catch,

195
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:46,454
you all have to wear the Future
lndustries logo on your uniforms.

196
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:48,707
l'll tattoo it on my chest if you want, sir!

197
00:11:50,668 --> 00:11:52,669
Thank you both so much!

198
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:55,839
l promise the Fire Ferrets will make
the most of this opportunity!

199
00:11:59,093 --> 00:12:01,845
Out of the way, Daddy!
We're driving here!

200
00:12:08,686 --> 00:12:12,230
l see Tarrlok's gifts are getting more
and more extravagant.

201
00:12:12,356 --> 00:12:15,442
Yeah, that guy doesn't know
how to take no for an answer.

202
00:12:15,526 --> 00:12:18,653
Korra, are you doing all right?

203
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:20,822
Yeah, l'm fine.

204
00:12:22,283 --> 00:12:23,658
Why don't you take a break?

205
00:12:24,827 --> 00:12:26,703
l'm glad you turned down Tarrlok,

206
00:12:26,704 --> 00:12:29,706
but l just wanted to make sure
your decision was for the right reason.

207
00:12:29,707 --> 00:12:32,834
l'm just really focused
on my airbending right now is all.

208
00:12:33,711 --> 00:12:36,713
Right, that's what you said.

209
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:40,049
You know, it's okay to be scared.

210
00:12:40,134 --> 00:12:43,178
The whole city is frightened
by what's been going on.

211
00:12:43,721 --> 00:12:47,182
The important thing
is to talk about our fears.

212
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:50,185
Because if we don't,
they can throw us out of balance.

213
00:12:55,983 --> 00:12:58,359
l'm always here for you,
if you want to talk.

214
00:13:03,365 --> 00:13:05,742
Avatar Korra, l have something for you.

215
00:13:06,076 --> 00:13:08,286
lt doesn't matter
how many gifts Tarrlok sends,

216
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:10,955
l'm not joining his task force.

217
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:14,167
lt's not a gift, it's an invitation!

218
00:13:14,251 --> 00:13:15,502
To what?

219
00:13:15,586 --> 00:13:18,671
Tarrlok is throwing a gala in your honor.

220
00:13:18,756 --> 00:13:21,508
All of Republic City's movers
and shakers will be there.

221
00:13:21,592 --> 00:13:24,344
The Councilman humbly requests
your attendance.

222
00:13:37,775 --> 00:13:39,776
l can't believe this is all for me.

223
00:13:39,777 --> 00:13:42,070
l'm not sure what Tarrlok's plotting,

224
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:43,696
but keep your guard up.

225
00:13:43,781 --> 00:13:46,574
lt's not like him to throw a party
just for the fun of it.

226
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:49,410
So glad you could make it, Avatar Korra.

227
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:53,289
lf you'll excuse us,
the city awaits its hero.

228
00:13:56,043 --> 00:13:58,795
Meelo, no! That is not a toilet! Oh, dear.

229
00:13:59,463 --> 00:14:01,798
Korra, it is my pleasure to introduce

230
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:05,927
Republic City's most famous
industrialist, Hiroshi Sato.

231
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:07,637
Nice to meet you.

232
00:14:08,013 --> 00:14:10,807
We're all expecting great things
from you.

233
00:14:11,225 --> 00:14:13,810
Right. Greatness.

234
00:14:13,811 --> 00:14:15,019
Hey, Korra.

235
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:19,107
This is my daughter, Asami.

236
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:22,527
lt's lovely to meet you.
Mako told me so much about you.

237
00:14:22,611 --> 00:14:24,988
Really? Because he hasn't mentioned
you at all.

238
00:14:25,072 --> 00:14:26,155
How did you two meet?

239
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,949
Asami crashed into him on her moped.

240
00:14:28,033 --> 00:14:30,076
What? Are you okay?

241
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,787
l'm fine. More than fine!

242
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:35,623
Mr. Sato agreed to sponsor our team.

243
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:37,500
We're back in the tournament!

244
00:14:37,585 --> 00:14:38,835
lsn't that great?

245
00:14:38,836 --> 00:14:40,920
Yeah, terrific.

246
00:14:42,673 --> 00:14:46,718
Chief Beifong, l believe you and
Avatar Korra have already met.

247
00:14:46,802 --> 00:14:49,095
Just because the city's throwing you
this big to-do,

248
00:14:49,179 --> 00:14:50,805
don't think you're something special.

249
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:53,850
You've done absolutely nothing
to deserve this.

250
00:15:09,158 --> 00:15:12,118
lf you'd be so kind,
they just have a couple questions.

251
00:15:12,202 --> 00:15:13,536
But...

252
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:18,666
Avatar Korra, you witnessed Amon
take away people's bending firsthand.

253
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:20,335
How serious a threat does he pose

254
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:22,462
to the innocent citizens
of Republic City?

255
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:26,883
l think... He presents a real problem.

256
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:30,887
Then why have you refused to join
Tarrlok's task force?

257
00:15:30,888 --> 00:15:33,640
As the Avatar,
shouldn't you be going after Amon?

258
00:15:33,724 --> 00:15:35,099
Well... l...

259
00:15:35,184 --> 00:15:36,768
Why are you backing away
from this fight?

260
00:15:36,852 --> 00:15:40,772
What? No. l've never backed away
from anything in my life.

261
00:15:40,856 --> 00:15:42,148
You promised to serve this city.

262
00:15:42,232 --> 00:15:43,691
Aren't you going back
on that promise now?

263
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:46,277
Do you think Pro-bending is more
important than fighting the revolution?

264
00:15:46,362 --> 00:15:47,987
How do you think
Avatar Aang would have handled this?

265
00:15:48,072 --> 00:15:49,280
Are you afraid ofAmon?

266
00:15:49,365 --> 00:15:51,866
l'm not afraid of anybody!

267
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:54,410
lf the city needs me, then...

268
00:15:54,495 --> 00:15:57,538
l'll join Tarrlok's task force
and help fight Amon.

269
00:15:57,623 --> 00:15:59,916
There's your headline, folks!

270
00:16:17,935 --> 00:16:19,936
My fellow task force deputies,

271
00:16:19,937 --> 00:16:21,354
tonight we will execute a raid

272
00:16:21,438 --> 00:16:23,773
on an underground Chi-blocker
training camp

273
00:16:23,857 --> 00:16:25,984
located in the Dragon Flats borough.

274
00:16:26,068 --> 00:16:27,860
According to my sources,

275
00:16:27,945 --> 00:16:30,071
there is a cellar underneath
this bookstore

276
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:33,783
where Equalists train Chi-blocking
in secret.

277
00:17:31,008 --> 00:17:32,425
l'm going after those two!

278
00:17:45,022 --> 00:17:47,023
Nice timing. Thanks, Tarrlok.

279
00:17:47,024 --> 00:17:49,067
We make a good team, Avatar.

280
00:17:51,028 --> 00:17:52,653
Yeah, we do!

281
00:18:01,622 --> 00:18:03,122
No Korra for practice again?

282
00:18:03,207 --> 00:18:04,957
Doesn't look like it.

283
00:18:07,503 --> 00:18:11,214
Avatar Korra has braveIy answered
the call to action.

284
00:18:11,298 --> 00:18:13,049
With the two of us Ieading the charge,

285
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:16,969
Republic City has nothing to fear
from Amon and the EquaIists!

286
00:18:17,054 --> 00:18:19,680
Question for the Avatar.
Amon remains at large.

287
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:21,057
Why have you failed to locate him?

288
00:18:21,141 --> 00:18:22,433
You wanna know why?

289
00:18:22,518 --> 00:18:25,895
Because Amon is hiding in the shadows
like a coward!

290
00:18:25,979 --> 00:18:29,065
Amon, I chaIIenge you to a dueI!

291
00:18:29,066 --> 00:18:32,026
No task force, no Chi-blockers.

292
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:37,532
Just the two of us, tonight at midnight
on Avatar Aang MemoriaI IsIand.

293
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:40,159
Let's cut to the chase
and settIe this thing,

294
00:18:40,244 --> 00:18:42,453
if you're man enough to face me!

295
00:18:50,087 --> 00:18:52,088
l know it sounds weird to say this,

296
00:18:52,089 --> 00:18:54,674
but l'm really glad l hit you
with my moped.

297
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:57,510
Me, too.

298
00:18:58,095 --> 00:18:59,762
l forgot to ask,

299
00:18:59,847 --> 00:19:03,307
why didn't you accept the new silk scarf
l bought for you last week?

300
00:19:03,392 --> 00:19:06,352
-You didn't like it?
-No, it was really nice. But...

301
00:19:06,436 --> 00:19:11,107
This scarf was my father's,
and it's all l have left of him.

302
00:19:12,109 --> 00:19:15,611
l just feel like... Like it keeps me safe.

303
00:19:16,113 --> 00:19:20,199
l'm so sorry. l lost my mother
when l was very young.

304
00:19:28,292 --> 00:19:30,126
l feel so safe with you.

305
00:19:38,343 --> 00:19:39,760
Korra, this is madness.

306
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:42,638
Don't try to stop me,
and don't follow me!

307
00:19:42,723 --> 00:19:44,265
l have to face Amon alone.

308
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:45,892
This is all your doing!

309
00:19:45,976 --> 00:19:49,770
l tried to talk her out of it, too,
but she's made up her mind.

310
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:55,568
We'll be watching the island closely.

311
00:19:55,652 --> 00:19:57,153
lf anything goes wrong,

312
00:19:57,154 --> 00:20:00,448
l have a fleet of police airships
ready to swoop down.

313
00:20:47,037 --> 00:20:49,372
Guess you're a no-show, Amon.

314
00:20:49,456 --> 00:20:51,207
Who's scared now?

315
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:33,582
l received your invitation, young Avatar.

316
00:21:42,759 --> 00:21:47,263
Our showdown, while inevitable,
is premature.

317
00:21:47,347 --> 00:21:49,265
Although it would be the simplest thing

318
00:21:49,266 --> 00:21:52,560
for me to take away
your bending right now,

319
00:21:52,644 --> 00:21:54,103
l won't.

320
00:21:54,187 --> 00:21:56,605
You'd only become a martyr.

321
00:21:56,690 --> 00:22:01,652
Benders of every nation would rally
behind your untimely demise.

322
00:22:01,737 --> 00:22:05,448
But l assure you, l have a plan,

323
00:22:05,532 --> 00:22:08,409
and l'm saving you for last.

324
00:22:08,493 --> 00:22:14,290
Then you'll get your duel,
and l will destroy you.

325
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:31,599
-Aang...
-Korra!

326
00:22:32,309 --> 00:22:35,311
Korra, are you all right?
What happened? Was Amon here?

327
00:22:36,063 --> 00:22:39,398
Yeah. He ambushed me.

328
00:22:39,483 --> 00:22:41,776
Did he...
Did he take your bending away?

329
00:22:44,654 --> 00:22:47,323
No. l'm okay.

330
00:22:47,407 --> 00:22:49,325
Thank goodness.

331
00:22:52,329 --> 00:22:56,707
l was so terrified! l felt so helpless!

332
00:22:56,792 --> 00:22:59,835
lt's all right, the nightmare is over.

333
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:03,339
You... You were right.

334
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:05,966
l've been scared this whole time.

335
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:09,345
l've never felt like this before and...

336
00:23:09,346 --> 00:23:11,472
Tenzin, l don't know what to do!

337
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:17,561
Admitting your fears
is the first and most difficult step

338
00:23:17,646 --> 00:23:19,355
in overcoming them.
