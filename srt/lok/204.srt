FIRE...

00:00:11,083 --> 00:00:12,625
AIR...

00:00:12,667 --> 00:00:14,834
WATER.

5
00:00:14,875 --> 00:00:18,709
ONLY THE AVATAR CAN MASTER
ALL FOUR ELEMENTS

6
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:20,917
AND BRING BALANCE TO THE WORLD.

00:00:20,959 --> 00:00:22,959

00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:29,917
- TENSIONS BETWEEN THE NORTHERN
AND SOUTHERN WATER TRIBES

10
00:00:29,959 --> 00:00:31,417
HAVE REACHED A BREAKING POINT.

11
00:00:31,458 --> 00:00:34,000
AFTER CHIEF UNALAQ'S TROOPS
TOOK OVER THE SOUTH,

12
00:00:34,041 --> 00:00:35,667
VARRICK INCITED AN UPRISING.

13
00:00:35,709 --> 00:00:38,667
BUT KORRA STOPPED THE REBELS
FROM ABDUCTING HER UNCLE.

14
00:00:38,709 --> 00:00:40,208
ENRAGED BY THE INSURRECTION,

15
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:42,583
UNALAQ ARRESTED THE REBELS
AND KORRA'S PARENTS,

16
00:00:42,625 --> 00:00:45,583
ACCUSING THEM OF CONSPIRING
TO ASSASSINATE HIM.

17
00:00:45,625 --> 00:00:47,000
WILL KORRA BE ABLE
TO SAVE HER PARENTS

18
00:00:47,041 --> 00:00:48,458
AND PREVENT CIVIL WAR?

19
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:53,709
[wind whooshes]

20
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:56,917

[engine turns over]

23
00:01:07,542 --> 00:01:09,208
- YOU'RE MAKING A MISTAKE.

24
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:11,041
- I WISH IT HADN'T COME TO THIS.

25
00:01:11,083 --> 00:01:12,750
BUT YOUR PARENTS HELD MEETINGS
WITH THE REBELS,

26
00:01:12,792 --> 00:01:14,458
RIGHT HERE IN THEIR HOME.

27
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:16,542
- I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'RE DOING
THIS TO YOUR OWN FAMILY.

28
00:01:16,583 --> 00:01:18,959
- REST ASSURED,
I'VE APPOINTED JUDGE HOTAH

29
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,417
TO OVERSEE THE TRIAL.

30
00:01:20,458 --> 00:01:23,041
HE IS THE MOST FAIR
AND HONORABLE MAN I KNOW.

31
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:25,083
- UNCLE, MY PARENTS
HAD NOTHING TO DO

32
00:01:25,125 --> 00:01:26,208
WITH THE MEN
WHO ATTACKED YOU.

33
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:27,625
- I'M SURE YOU'RE RIGHT.

34
00:01:27,667 --> 00:01:30,834
SO WE SHOULD HAVE NOTHING
TO WORRY ABOUT.

35
00:01:30,875 --> 00:01:32,834
- I HOPE SO.

36
00:01:38,917 --> 00:01:40,709
- WHERE'S VARRICK?

37
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:42,834
WE SHOULD'VE CLOSED OUR DEAL
AN HOUR AGO.

38
00:01:42,875 --> 00:01:45,750
- WOULD YOU RELAX?
THIS PLACE IS GREAT.

39
00:01:45,792 --> 00:01:48,834
AND THE BEST PART ABOUT IT?
ESKA DOESN'T KNOW I'M HERE.

40
00:01:48,875 --> 00:01:51,792
[raccoon peeps,
door clangs]

41
00:01:51,834 --> 00:01:53,000
- EE-YAH.

42
00:01:53,041 --> 00:01:54,166
I WASN'T HIDING.

43
00:01:54,208 --> 00:01:55,834
HEY, HEY-HEY, HEY.

44
00:01:55,875 --> 00:01:57,542
- I'M NOT ON THE HUNT FOR YOU.

45
00:01:57,583 --> 00:01:59,333
CURRENTLY.

46
00:01:59,375 --> 00:02:01,000
- WE SEARCH FOR VARRICK.

47
00:02:01,041 --> 00:02:03,083
OUR FATHER WISHES HIM
TO STAND TRIAL.

48
00:02:03,125 --> 00:02:04,625
- WHAT DID HE DO?

49
00:02:04,667 --> 00:02:06,000
- HE IS A TRAITOR
TO THE WATER TRIBE,

50
00:02:06,041 --> 00:02:07,959
ALONG WITH OUR AUNT AND UNCLE.

51
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,166
- WHAT?
- KORRA'S PARENTS WERE ARRESTED?

52
00:02:10,208 --> 00:02:13,667
- YES. YOUR POWERS OF DEDUCTION
ARE IMPRESSIVE.

53
00:02:13,709 --> 00:02:15,166
- YEAH, HE'S A COP.

54
00:02:15,208 --> 00:02:16,166
- VARRICK'S NOT HERE.

55
00:02:16,208 --> 00:02:17,583
- VERY WELL.

56
00:02:17,625 --> 00:02:20,959
DESNA, LET US CONTINUE
OUR SEARCH ELSEWHERE.

57
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,166
BOYFRIEND!
BOW TO ME WHEN I EXIT.

58
00:02:23,208 --> 00:02:26,709
- YES, YES,
MY SWEET KOALA-OTTER.

59
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:30,250
- YOU ARE SO CUTE
WHEN YOU GROVEL.

[door shuts]

61
00:02:31,792 --> 00:02:32,959
- DON'T LET HER TREAT YOU
THAT WAY.

62
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,583
STAND UP FOR YOURSELF.

63
00:02:34,625 --> 00:02:36,041
- I TRIED TO BREAK UP WITH HER,

64
00:02:36,083 --> 00:02:38,417
BUT MAKO GAVE ME
TERRIBLE ADVICE.

65
00:02:38,458 --> 00:02:39,834
THANK YOU, MAKO.

66
00:02:39,875 --> 00:02:41,750
- WAIT, HOW ARE YOUR GIRL
PROBLEMS MY FAULT?

67
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:44,208
- BOLIN, YOU NEED TO BE HONEST
WITH HER.

68
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:46,125
TELL HER HOW YOU REALLY FEEL.

69
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:48,000
- [muffled]
HONESTY IS FOR FOOLS, KID!

70
00:02:48,041 --> 00:02:49,375
- VARRICK?

71
00:02:49,417 --> 00:02:50,750
- [muffled] IF YOU WANT
TO DITCH THIS GIRL,

72
00:02:50,792 --> 00:02:52,542
THEN MAKE YOURSELF SCARCE.

73
00:02:52,583 --> 00:02:53,959
DISAPPEAR, LIKE I DID!

74
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,375
- WHERE ARE YOU?

75
00:02:55,417 --> 00:02:57,667
- SOMEWHERE
UNALAQ WILL NEVER FIND ME.

76
00:02:57,709 --> 00:03:00,250
INSIDE PING-PING!

77
00:03:00,291 --> 00:03:02,000
HOW WE DOIN'?

78
00:03:02,041 --> 00:03:03,041
- THE COAST IS CLEAR.

79
00:03:03,083 --> 00:03:04,083
YOU CAN COME OUT.

80
00:03:04,125 --> 00:03:05,500
- NO WAY, MISTER.

81
00:03:05,542 --> 00:03:10,583
NOT UNTIL I KNOW
IT'S ABSOLUTELY, 157% SAFE.

82
00:03:10,625 --> 00:03:12,709
AHH! THANK YOU, ZHU LI.

83
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:14,333
- YOUR ASSISTANT'S IN THERE TOO?

84
00:03:14,375 --> 00:03:16,834

- [muffled]
SORRY, SIR.

89
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:24,458
THERE ISN'T ANY IN HERE.

90
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:26,166
- NO HONEY?

91
00:03:26,208 --> 00:03:29,000
WE'RE IN A BEAR,
FOR CRYING OUT LOUD!

92
00:03:29,041 --> 00:03:31,250
- I'M GONNA GO SEE
HOW KORRA'S DOING.

93
00:03:31,291 --> 00:03:34,959
- BOLIN, I GOT A LITTLE
SOMETHING FOR YOU 'ROUND BACK.

94
00:03:38,083 --> 00:03:39,417
- WOW!

95
00:03:39,458 --> 00:03:42,291
- NOW LISTEN UP.

96
00:03:42,333 --> 00:03:44,750
UNALAQ'S RIGGED THIS TRIAL,
NO DOUBT ABOUT IT.

00:03:44,792 --> 00:03:45,917
SO I NEED YOU TO MAKE SURE

98
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:47,792
MY TRUSTY REBELS
STAY OUT OF PRISON.

99
00:03:47,834 --> 00:03:49,000
- WHAT'S THE MONEY FOR?

100
00:03:49,041 --> 00:03:50,667
- [laughing]
BRIBERY, OF COURSE!

101
00:03:50,709 --> 00:03:52,458
THERE'S ALWAYS SOMEONE WILLING
TO LOOK THE OTHER WAY

102
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,125
FOR A FEW YUANS.

103
00:03:54,166 --> 00:03:59,291

GO BOTHER SOMEONE ELSE.

108
00:04:10,834 --> 00:04:12,959
YOU TWO ARE WORSE
THAN KYA AND BUMI.

109
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,542

00:04:46,041 --> 00:04:47,166
I GUESS YOU FOUND ME.

126
00:04:47,208 --> 00:04:49,333
DO I HAVE TO GO NOW?

127
00:04:49,375 --> 00:04:51,959
- ACTUALLY, IS THERE ROOM
FOR ONE MORE?

128
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,917
- UH, SURE.

129
00:04:53,959 --> 00:04:58,208
YOU CAN SIT
NEXT TO BLUEBERRY SPICEHEAD.

130
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:00,625

00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:06,125
THEY'RE MY NEW BROTHERS

136
00:05:07,834 --> 00:05:10,959
CAN THEY BE MY NEW BROTHERS
AND SISTERS TOO?

137
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,375
- MAYBE, BUT ONLY
IF THEY SAY IT'S OKAY.

UH-HUH, UH-HUH.

139
00:05:16,417 --> 00:05:17,709
NO, NO, HE'S NICE.

140
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:19,333
THEY SAY IT'S OKAY.

[crowd murmuring]

142
00:05:36,792 --> 00:05:39,417
- WE'RE GOOD TO GO. I GAVE ALL
THE MONEY TO SOME GUYS OVER
THERE.

143
00:05:39,458 --> 00:05:41,458
I TOLD THEM
TO "TAKE CARE OF IT,"

144
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:42,834
AND THEN I WINKED.

145
00:05:42,875 --> 00:05:45,208
[laughs] PRETTY SURE
THEY GOT THE MESSAGE.

146
00:05:49,375 --> 00:05:51,417

- YEAH, YOU THINK?

151
00:06:02,542 --> 00:06:05,792
- I WAS ASLEEP IN MY CHAMBERS
WHEN THE REBELS ATTACKED.

152
00:06:05,834 --> 00:06:07,709
THEY OVERPOWERED ME,

153
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:09,834
AND THE NEXT THING I REMEMBER
WAS WAKING UP IN THE SNOW

154
00:06:09,875 --> 00:06:13,500
AFTER AVATAR KORRA HAD SAVED ME.

155
00:06:13,542 --> 00:06:15,500
- ACCORDING

156
00:06:15,542 --> 00:06:17,000
YOU ATTENDED A MEETING

157
00:06:17,041 --> 00:06:18,875
WHERE VARRICK TRIED TO INCITE

00:06:18,917 --> 00:06:21,250
IS THAT TRUE?
- YES.

159
00:06:21,291 --> 00:06:23,375
- AND WERE THESE MEN PRESENT
AT THAT MEETING?

160
00:06:23,417 --> 00:06:25,917
- WELL, YES, BUT--

161
00:06:25,959 --> 00:06:28,375

DID THIS MEETING TAKE PLACE?

162
00:06:28,417 --> 00:06:29,667
- OBJECTION!

163
00:06:29,709 --> 00:06:32,375
- QUIET DOWN OUT THERE!

164
00:06:32,417 --> 00:06:34,291
I'LL ASK YOU ONE MORE TIME.

165
00:06:34,333 --> 00:06:36,667
WHERE DID THE MEETING HAPPEN?

166
00:06:36,709 --> 00:06:38,792
- MY PARENTS' HOUSE.

167
00:06:38,834 --> 00:06:40,750
- AND WHO LED THIS MEETING?

168
00:06:40,792 --> 00:06:42,417

00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,333
- MAY I...DECLARE A MISTRIAL?

171
00:06:47,375 --> 00:06:50,583
- SIT DOWN.

172
00:06:50,625 --> 00:06:53,125
VARRICK AND YOUR FATHER
LED THE MEETING, DIDN'T THEY?

173
00:06:53,166 --> 00:06:54,875
- MY PARENTS ARE INNOCENT!

174
00:06:54,917 --> 00:06:56,709
- I'VE HEARD ALL I NEED TO.

175
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:59,875
I'LL RETURN SHORTLY
WITH MY DECISION.

176
00:07:07,583 --> 00:07:09,291
- HEY THERE, ESKA!

177
00:07:09,333 --> 00:07:12,083
I WAS WONDERING
