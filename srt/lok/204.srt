1
00:00:07,547 --> 00:00:09,548
Earth.

2
00:00:09,549 --> 00:00:11,049
Fire.

3
00:00:11,050 --> 00:00:13,051
Air.

4
00:00:13,052 --> 00:00:15,153
Water.

5
00:00:15,154 --> 00:00:18,957
Only the Avatar can master
all four elements

6
00:00:18,958 --> 00:00:21,259
and bring balance to the world.

7
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:29,634
Tensions between the Northern
and Southern Water Tribes

8
00:00:29,635 --> 00:00:31,236
have reached a breaking point.

9
00:00:31,237 --> 00:00:34,106
After Chief Unalaq's troops
took over the South,

10
00:00:34,107 --> 00:00:35,774
Varrick incited an uprising,

11
00:00:35,775 --> 00:00:38,744
but Korra stopped the rebels
from abducting her uncle.

12
00:00:38,745 --> 00:00:40,145
Enraged by the insurrection,

13
00:00:40,146 --> 00:00:42,481
Unalaq arrested the rebels
and Korra's parents,

14
00:00:42,482 --> 00:00:45,484
accusing them of conspiring
to assassinate him.

15
00:00:45,485 --> 00:00:47,018
Will Korra be able to save her parents

16
00:00:47,019 --> 00:00:48,754
and prevent civil war?

17
00:01:07,039 --> 00:01:09,174
- You're making a mistake.

18
00:01:09,175 --> 00:01:10,809
- I wish it hadn't come to this.

19
00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:12,577
But your parents held meetings
with the rebels,

20
00:01:12,578 --> 00:01:14,045
right here in their home.

21
00:01:14,046 --> 00:01:16,414
- I can't believe you're doing
this to your own family.

22
00:01:16,415 --> 00:01:18,950
- Rest assured,
I've appointed Judge Hotah

23
00:01:18,951 --> 00:01:20,285
to oversee the trial.

24
00:01:20,286 --> 00:01:23,021
He is the most fair
and honorable man I know.

25
00:01:23,022 --> 00:01:25,056
- Uncle, my parents had nothing to do

26
00:01:25,057 --> 00:01:26,158
with the men who attacked you.

27
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:27,492
- I'm sure you're right,

28
00:01:27,493 --> 00:01:30,862
so we should have nothing
to worry about.

29
00:01:30,863 --> 00:01:35,863
- I hope so.

30
00:01:38,905 --> 00:01:40,572
- Where's Varrick?

31
00:01:40,573 --> 00:01:42,674
We should've closed our deal
an hour ago.

32
00:01:42,675 --> 00:01:45,410
- Would you relax?
This place is great.

33
00:01:45,411 --> 00:01:48,680
And the best part about it?
Eska doesn't know I'm here.

34
00:01:51,851 --> 00:01:52,984
- Ee-yah.

35
00:01:52,985 --> 00:01:54,119
I wasn't hiding.

36
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,654
Hey, hey-hey, hey.

37
00:01:55,655 --> 00:01:57,622
- I'm not on the hunt for you...

38
00:01:57,623 --> 00:01:59,257
currently.

39
00:01:59,258 --> 00:02:00,725
- We search for Varrick.

40
00:02:00,726 --> 00:02:02,994
Our father wishes him to stand trial.

41
00:02:02,995 --> 00:02:04,429
- What did he do?

42
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:05,931
- He is a traitor to the Water Tribe,

43
00:02:05,932 --> 00:02:07,699
along with our aunt and uncle.

44
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:10,068
- What?
- Korra's parents were arrested?

45
00:02:10,069 --> 00:02:13,705
- Yes. Your powers of deduction
are impressive.

46
00:02:13,706 --> 00:02:15,106
- Yeah, he's a cop.

47
00:02:15,107 --> 00:02:17,309
- Varrick's not here.
- Very well.

48
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:20,946
Desna, let us continue
our search elsewhere.

49
00:02:20,947 --> 00:02:23,114
Boyfriend!
Bow to me when I exit.

50
00:02:23,115 --> 00:02:27,085
- Yes, yes,
my sweet koala-otter.

51
00:02:27,086 --> 00:02:30,388
- You are so cute when you grovel.

52
00:02:31,557 --> 00:02:32,958
- Don't let her treat you that way.

53
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:34,426
Stand up for yourself.

54
00:02:34,427 --> 00:02:35,994
- I tried to break up with her,

55
00:02:35,995 --> 00:02:38,296
but Mako gave me terrible advice.

56
00:02:38,297 --> 00:02:39,531
Thank you, Mako.

57
00:02:39,532 --> 00:02:41,566
- Wait, how are
your girl problems my fault?

58
00:02:41,567 --> 00:02:44,135
- Bolin, you need to be honest with her.

59
00:02:44,136 --> 00:02:45,871
Tell her how you really feel.

60
00:02:45,872 --> 00:02:47,973
Honesty is for fools, kid!

61
00:02:47,974 --> 00:02:49,441
- Varrick?

62
00:02:49,442 --> 00:02:50,775
if you want to ditch this girl,

63
00:02:50,776 --> 00:02:52,410
then make yourself scarce.

64
00:02:52,411 --> 00:02:53,945
Disappear, like I did!

65
00:02:53,946 --> 00:02:55,280
- Where are you?

66
00:02:55,281 --> 00:02:57,716
- Somewhere
Unalaq will never find me.

67
00:02:57,717 --> 00:03:01,920
Inside Ping-Ping!
How we doin'?

68
00:03:01,921 --> 00:03:02,954
- The coast is clear.

69
00:03:02,955 --> 00:03:03,989
You can come out.

70
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:05,257
- No way, mister.

71
00:03:05,258 --> 00:03:10,258
Not until I know
it's absolutely, 157% safe.

72
00:03:10,596 --> 00:03:12,497
Ahh! Thank you, Zhu Li.

73
00:03:12,498 --> 00:03:14,199
- Your assistant's in there too?

74
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:16,768
- Zhu Li never leaves my side.

75
00:03:20,873 --> 00:03:22,040
You forgot the honey!

76
00:03:22,041 --> 00:03:23,074
Sorry, sir.

77
00:03:23,075 --> 00:03:24,476
There isn't any in here.

78
00:03:24,477 --> 00:03:25,844
- No honey?

79
00:03:25,845 --> 00:03:28,713
We're in a bear,
for crying out loud!

80
00:03:28,714 --> 00:03:30,916
- I'm gonna go see
how Korra's doing.

81
00:03:30,917 --> 00:03:35,917
- Bolin, I got a little
something for you 'round back.

82
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:39,491
- Wow!

83
00:03:39,492 --> 00:03:41,993
- Now listen up.

84
00:03:41,994 --> 00:03:44,763
Unalaq's rigged this trial,
no doubt about it,

85
00:03:44,764 --> 00:03:45,830
so I need you to make sure

86
00:03:45,831 --> 00:03:47,799
my trusty rebels stay out of prison.

87
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:48,967
- What's the money for?

88
00:03:48,968 --> 00:03:50,368
Bribery, of course!

89
00:03:50,369 --> 00:03:52,537
There's always someone willing
to look the other way

90
00:03:52,538 --> 00:03:53,772
for a few yuans.

91
00:03:53,773 --> 00:03:58,773
- I think I catch your drift,
Varrick-bear.

92
00:04:02,915 --> 00:04:05,283
- Ikki!

93
00:04:05,284 --> 00:04:06,818
Ikki, where are you?

94
00:04:06,819 --> 00:04:07,852
- Shoo!

95
00:04:07,853 --> 00:04:10,555
Go bother someone else.

96
00:04:10,556 --> 00:04:12,857
You two are worse
than Kya and Bumi.

97
00:04:12,858 --> 00:04:14,526
Okay, everybody here?

98
00:04:14,527 --> 00:04:15,760
- Ikki!

99
00:04:15,761 --> 00:04:16,995
Oh, thank goodness.

100
00:04:16,996 --> 00:04:19,831
- Juniper Lightning Bug,
paws off the table!

101
00:04:19,832 --> 00:04:23,702
This is going to be
a civilized breakfast.

102
00:04:23,703 --> 00:04:26,538
Daddy always says a blessing
before we eat, so...

103
00:04:26,539 --> 00:04:28,406
be quiet and listen up!

104
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:33,178
We are thankful
for this super yummy food

105
00:04:33,179 --> 00:04:35,180
and for being the best-est
new friends in the world.

106
00:04:35,181 --> 00:04:36,314
But we are most thankful

107
00:04:36,315 --> 00:04:38,616
because Meelo and Jinora
aren't here

108
00:04:38,617 --> 00:04:41,853
because they stink.

109
00:04:43,189 --> 00:04:44,589
Oh!

110
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:45,890
Hi, Daddy.

111
00:04:45,891 --> 00:04:47,559
I guess you found me.

112
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,160
Do I have to go now?

113
00:04:49,161 --> 00:04:51,863
- Actually, is there room
for one more?

114
00:04:51,864 --> 00:04:53,631
- Uh, sure.

115
00:04:53,632 --> 00:04:57,869
You can sit
next to Blueberry Spicehead.

116
00:04:57,870 --> 00:05:00,372
- Nice to meet you,
Blueberry Spicehead.

117
00:05:00,373 --> 00:05:01,806
- And that's Princess Rainbow,

118
00:05:01,807 --> 00:05:02,974
and that's Twinkle Starchild,

119
00:05:02,975 --> 00:05:04,442
and that's
Juniper Lightning Bug.

120
00:05:04,443 --> 00:05:05,977
They're my new brothers
and sisters.

121
00:05:05,978 --> 00:05:07,512
- New ones, huh?

122
00:05:07,513 --> 00:05:10,648
Can they be my new brothers
and sisters too?

123
00:05:10,649 --> 00:05:14,386
- Maybe,
but only if they say it's okay.

124
00:05:14,387 --> 00:05:16,187
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

125
00:05:16,188 --> 00:05:17,655
No, no, he's nice.

126
00:05:17,656 --> 00:05:22,656
They say it's okay.

127
00:05:36,609 --> 00:05:37,809
- We're good to go.

128
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:39,077
I gave all the money
to some guys over there.

129
00:05:39,078 --> 00:05:41,246
I told them to "take care of it,"

130
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:42,414
and then I winked.

131
00:05:42,415 --> 00:05:47,415
Pretty sure
they got the message.

132
00:05:51,223 --> 00:05:53,224
- This trial will now come to order!

133
00:05:53,225 --> 00:05:56,027
Judge Hotah presiding.

134
00:05:56,028 --> 00:05:58,663
- Man! I should have paid him!

135
00:05:58,664 --> 00:06:02,534
- Yeah, you think?

136
00:06:02,535 --> 00:06:05,637
- I was asleep in my chambers
when the rebels attacked.

137
00:06:05,638 --> 00:06:07,038
They overpowered me,

138
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:09,674
and the next thing I remember
was waking up in the snow

139
00:06:09,675 --> 00:06:13,211
after Avatar Korra had saved me.

140
00:06:13,212 --> 00:06:15,213
- According
to Unalaq's testimony,

141
00:06:15,214 --> 00:06:16,614
you attended a meeting

142
00:06:16,615 --> 00:06:18,716
where Varrick tried
to incite a civil war.

143
00:06:18,717 --> 00:06:20,819
Is that true?
- Yes.

144
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:23,121
- And were these men present
at that meeting?

145
00:06:23,122 --> 00:06:25,590
- Well, yes, but--

146
00:06:25,591 --> 00:06:28,359
- And where exactly
did this meeting take place?

147
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,594
- Objection!

148
00:06:29,595 --> 00:06:32,163
- Quiet down out there!

149
00:06:32,164 --> 00:06:34,099
I'll ask you one more time.

150
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:36,968
Where did the meeting happen?

151
00:06:36,969 --> 00:06:38,703
- My parents' house.

152
00:06:38,704 --> 00:06:40,472
- And who led this meeting?

153
00:06:40,473 --> 00:06:42,407
- Your Honor, if I may...

154
00:06:42,408 --> 00:06:43,641
- May what?

155
00:06:43,642 --> 00:06:47,112
- May I... declare a mistrial?

156
00:06:47,113 --> 00:06:50,315
- Sit down.

157
00:06:50,316 --> 00:06:52,951
Varrick and your father
led the meeting, didn't they?

158
00:06:52,952 --> 00:06:54,552
- My parents are innocent!

159
00:06:54,553 --> 00:06:56,421
- I've heard all I need to.

160
00:06:56,422 --> 00:07:01,422
I'll return shortly with my decision.

161
00:07:07,233 --> 00:07:09,033
- Hey there, Eska!

162
00:07:09,034 --> 00:07:11,669
I was wondering if we could talk.

163
00:07:11,670 --> 00:07:13,471
- I grant you permission
to speak freely.

164
00:07:13,472 --> 00:07:16,741
- Oh, good, because I just
need to be honest with you.

165
00:07:16,742 --> 00:07:19,043
You know, when we first met,
there was this crazy spark,

166
00:07:19,044 --> 00:07:23,748
but I'm starting to feel
like that spark is fading.

167
00:07:23,749 --> 00:07:25,016
- I agree.

168
00:07:25,017 --> 00:07:27,385
It is as if a great chasm
has formed between us

169
00:07:27,386 --> 00:07:28,620
and nothing can bridge it.

170
00:07:28,621 --> 00:07:30,321
- Ch! Oh, yes!

171
00:07:30,322 --> 00:07:32,857
I am so glad you understand!

172
00:07:32,858 --> 00:07:35,093
- Nothing, that is, except marriage.

173
00:07:37,963 --> 00:07:39,864
- We will wed at sunset.

174
00:07:39,865 --> 00:07:42,200
You may express your joy
through tears.

175
00:07:44,136 --> 00:07:45,403
Oh, no, I can't--

176
00:07:45,404 --> 00:07:48,873
This is really tight.

177
00:07:48,874 --> 00:07:53,874
- Senna, please step forward.

178
00:07:54,547 --> 00:07:56,714
I have found you innocent.

179
00:07:56,715 --> 00:07:58,116
You are free to go.

180
00:07:59,852 --> 00:08:04,022
- Korra!

181
00:08:04,023 --> 00:08:06,724
- On the charge of treason,

182
00:08:06,725 --> 00:08:08,893
you are all found guilty.

183
00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:14,832
The punishment for this crime
is death.

184
00:08:28,147 --> 00:08:29,981
- You can't do this!

185
00:08:29,982 --> 00:08:32,617
You take their lives,
and I'll take yours.

186
00:08:32,618 --> 00:08:34,485
- Korra, calm down.

187
00:08:34,486 --> 00:08:39,090
I'll talk to him.

188
00:08:39,091 --> 00:08:42,727
I know I promised to respect
whatever decision you made,

189
00:08:42,728 --> 00:08:45,096
but I must ask you to reconsider.

190
00:08:45,097 --> 00:08:50,097
Show these men
and my brother mercy.

191
00:08:51,704 --> 00:08:52,837
- Very well.

192
00:08:52,838 --> 00:08:54,973
I'll change their punishment.

193
00:08:54,974 --> 00:08:56,841
Your lives will be spared,

194
00:08:56,842 --> 00:09:01,279
but you will live them out in prison.

195
00:09:07,319 --> 00:09:09,821
- Thank you, Uncle.

196
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:18,463
- You like that, don't you,
Blueberry Spicehead?

197
00:09:18,464 --> 00:09:19,931
Yes, you do.

198
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,568
You know, I could get
used to it here.

199
00:09:23,569 --> 00:09:27,005
No one's yelling at me
or telling me I'm delusional.

200
00:09:27,006 --> 00:09:29,140
- We should have Uncle Bumi
and Aunt Kya come visit.

201
00:09:29,141 --> 00:09:30,708
I bet they'd like it too.

202
00:09:30,709 --> 00:09:31,843
- Let's not.

203
00:09:31,844 --> 00:09:33,745
They'll only spoil our good mood.

204
00:09:33,746 --> 00:09:34,779
- What do you mean?

205
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:36,781
Aunt Kya is super nice and pretty

206
00:09:36,782 --> 00:09:38,349
and always asks me how I'm feeling.

207
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:40,285
And Uncle Bumi is, like,
the funniest person

208
00:09:40,286 --> 00:09:41,586
in the world.

209
00:09:41,587 --> 00:09:42,787
- But what about Meelo?

210
00:09:42,788 --> 00:09:44,689
He's hilarious too.

211
00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:46,891
You never know what's
going to come out of his mouth.

212
00:09:46,892 --> 00:09:50,061
And Jinora can be so sweet
and gentle.

213
00:09:50,062 --> 00:09:51,496
- And mean.

214
00:09:51,497 --> 00:09:54,098
And bossy.

215
00:09:54,099 --> 00:09:57,268
Being part of a family
is hard, huh, Daddy?

216
00:09:57,269 --> 00:09:59,237
- I couldn't agree with you more.

217
00:10:11,417 --> 00:10:13,618
- But I guess the nice part
about a family

218
00:10:13,619 --> 00:10:15,653
is they'll always be there for you.

219
00:10:15,654 --> 00:10:18,189
Even though Twinkle Starchild
and Princess Rainbow fight,

220
00:10:18,190 --> 00:10:19,924
they still love each other.

221
00:10:19,925 --> 00:10:22,193
- That's very wise of you, lkki.

222
00:10:22,194 --> 00:10:24,495
- We should probably
head back, huh?

223
00:10:24,496 --> 00:10:25,630
- I suppose.

224
00:10:25,631 --> 00:10:29,434
We can't hide in this cave forever.

225
00:10:29,435 --> 00:10:30,735
- Don't worry, Daddy.

226
00:10:30,736 --> 00:10:32,603
We'll come back
and visit Blueberry Spicehead.

227
00:10:32,604 --> 00:10:34,439
I know you really bonded with her.

228
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:39,440
- Yes, I'd like that.

229
00:10:44,416 --> 00:10:46,951
Honey, are you all right?
- I'm fine.

230
00:10:46,952 --> 00:10:49,554
- Good, then let's bust you
out of here right now.

231
00:10:49,555 --> 00:10:50,722
- Korra, no.

232
00:10:50,723 --> 00:10:53,157
Saving me would start a war.

233
00:10:53,158 --> 00:10:55,560
If fighting were to break out,
the North would crush the South.

234
00:10:55,561 --> 00:10:57,261
I'll be all right.

235
00:10:57,262 --> 00:11:01,065
Just promise me
you won't do anything rash.

236
00:11:01,066 --> 00:11:02,100
- Fine.

237
00:11:02,101 --> 00:11:03,634
I promise.

238
00:11:16,281 --> 00:11:18,549
- It's okay, Mom.

239
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:22,420
- I-I hate feeling so helpless.

240
00:11:22,421 --> 00:11:27,421
- I know.

241
00:11:57,189 --> 00:11:58,856
- Oh!

242
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:04,095
What do you want?

243
00:12:04,096 --> 00:12:05,663
- It's not about what I want.

244
00:12:05,664 --> 00:12:07,298
It's about what Naga wants,

245
00:12:07,299 --> 00:12:09,967
and she'd like you
to let my father out of prison.

246
00:12:09,968 --> 00:12:12,503
- I-I'm sorry,
but there's nothing I can do.

247
00:12:12,504 --> 00:12:14,939
I was just following Unalaq's orders.

248
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:16,040
- What are you talking about?

249
00:12:16,041 --> 00:12:18,042
- I-I've said too much.

250
00:12:19,278 --> 00:12:21,412
- Unless you wanna be
Naga's afternoon snack,

251
00:12:21,413 --> 00:12:22,914
you better keep talking.

252
00:12:22,915 --> 00:12:25,249
- I-I've worked
for your uncle for years!

253
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:28,286
He said he needed everyone
to think the trial was fair.

254
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:30,655
- So Unalaq told you what to say?

255
00:12:30,656 --> 00:12:32,190
- Yes! Every word.

256
00:12:32,191 --> 00:12:34,358
- Then why did he have you
free my mother

257
00:12:34,359 --> 00:12:35,526
and change your sentence?

258
00:12:35,527 --> 00:12:37,228
- He's trying to keep you on his side,

259
00:12:37,229 --> 00:12:39,263
but he also wants your father
out of the way,

260
00:12:39,264 --> 00:12:41,399
just like when
he got your father banished.

261
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:44,502
- What do you mean
"he got my father banished"?

262
00:12:44,503 --> 00:12:46,070
- Nothing!

263
00:12:46,071 --> 00:12:51,071
- Keep talking.

264
00:12:53,545 --> 00:12:55,413
Uh...

265
00:12:55,414 --> 00:12:57,215
Hey there, Dad.

266
00:12:57,216 --> 00:12:59,000
You're looking well.

267
00:13:02,154 --> 00:13:03,955
Look, uh, I'm sorry

268
00:13:03,956 --> 00:13:06,524
I didn't turn out to be
an Airbender like you hoped,

269
00:13:06,525 --> 00:13:10,061
but I've tried my best
to keep the world safe.

270
00:13:10,062 --> 00:13:11,629
Hope I made you proud.

271
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:14,932
- Of course he'd be proud
of you, Bumi.

272
00:13:14,933 --> 00:13:17,602
- Kya! I-I was just, uh...

273
00:13:17,603 --> 00:13:19,003
cleaning off Dad's statue.

274
00:13:19,004 --> 00:13:21,873
It's so dusty in here.

275
00:13:21,874 --> 00:13:24,742
- Come here.

276
00:13:24,743 --> 00:13:26,043
- Thanks, Kya.

277
00:13:26,044 --> 00:13:31,044
You always know when I need a hug.

278
00:13:31,283 --> 00:13:33,451
- Unalaq's a liar and a traitor!

279
00:13:33,452 --> 00:13:36,087
- I've been trying to tell you that
from the get-go.

280
00:13:36,088 --> 00:13:37,488
- What happened?

281
00:13:37,489 --> 00:13:39,390
- I found out the truth
about my dad's banishment.

282
00:13:39,391 --> 00:13:42,393
Unalaq hired the barbarians
to attack their tribe,

283
00:13:42,394 --> 00:13:44,629
then he told them to hide
in the spirit forest,

284
00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:46,497
knowing my dad would go after them.

285
00:13:46,498 --> 00:13:48,699
- Unalaq wanted your dad out of the way

286
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:50,468
so he could become chief.

287
00:13:50,469 --> 00:13:51,869
It was a setup.

288
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:53,504
- Just like the whole trial.

289
00:13:53,505 --> 00:13:56,340
I can't believe I trusted him.

290
00:13:56,341 --> 00:13:58,309
I'm busting my father
and the rebels out of jail.

291
00:13:58,310 --> 00:14:00,044
I need your help.

292
00:14:00,045 --> 00:14:02,947
- If you do this,
there's no going back.

293
00:14:02,948 --> 00:14:04,015
- I know.

294
00:14:04,016 --> 00:14:05,783
Will you help me or not?

295
00:14:05,784 --> 00:14:07,652
- Of course, I'll help.
- Me too.

296
00:14:07,653 --> 00:14:09,287
- Count me in!

297
00:14:15,527 --> 00:14:17,094
- I don't even want to know.

298
00:14:17,095 --> 00:14:20,331
- So I'm guessing the breakup
with Eska didn't go well?

299
00:14:20,332 --> 00:14:22,500
- No, no, the honesty thing
worked out great--

300
00:14:22,501 --> 00:14:25,636
so great that she decided
we should get married!

301
00:14:25,637 --> 00:14:27,838
- Sorry.
- I'm pretty sure

302
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:29,674
the guy is supposed to give the girl

303
00:14:29,675 --> 00:14:30,808
the betrothal necklace.

304
00:14:30,809 --> 00:14:33,177
- I guess Eska didn't get the memo.

305
00:14:33,178 --> 00:14:35,580
- Look, the only way
to deal with crazy women

306
00:14:35,581 --> 00:14:37,248
is to lie big and leave fast.

307
00:14:37,249 --> 00:14:39,250
Lucky for you,
Varrick's got your back.

308
00:14:39,251 --> 00:14:41,185
Now gather 'round Ping-Ping.

309
00:14:41,186 --> 00:14:43,087
Let's talk plan.

310
00:14:58,971 --> 00:15:02,039
- My dad's in there.

311
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:04,775
Where is he?
- I'm sorry, Korra.

312
00:15:04,776 --> 00:15:09,776
You'll never see your father again.

313
00:15:17,089 --> 00:15:18,956
- Where's my father?

314
00:15:18,957 --> 00:15:21,425
- On a ship headed
to the Northern Tribe.

315
00:15:21,426 --> 00:15:23,060
He'll serve out his sentence there.

316
00:15:23,061 --> 00:15:24,395
- Bring him back

317
00:15:24,396 --> 00:15:26,697
or I'm taking you out
and the rest of your army.

318
00:15:26,698 --> 00:15:28,065
- Remember who you are.

319
00:15:28,066 --> 00:15:30,835
As the Avatar,
you cannot threaten war.

320
00:15:30,836 --> 00:15:32,937
You must remain neutral

321
00:15:32,938 --> 00:15:34,872
or our tribes will never find unity.

322
00:15:34,873 --> 00:15:36,307
- You don't want unity.

323
00:15:36,308 --> 00:15:37,875
You want power.

324
00:15:37,876 --> 00:15:40,845
You've always been jealous
of my father, haven't you?

325
00:15:40,846 --> 00:15:43,080
You got him banished
so you could become chief,

326
00:15:43,081 --> 00:15:44,915
and I bet it just killed you

327
00:15:44,916 --> 00:15:47,284
to learn he was the Avatar's father.

328
00:15:47,285 --> 00:15:49,954
No wonder you kept trying
to take me away from him.

329
00:15:49,955 --> 00:15:53,290
- All I've ever wanted is to
help you realize your destiny.

330
00:15:53,291 --> 00:15:56,060
- Well, I don't want your help anymore.

331
00:15:56,061 --> 00:15:57,428
- If you start a war,

332
00:15:57,429 --> 00:15:59,597
the dark spirits
will annihilate the South,

333
00:15:59,598 --> 00:16:02,066
and even I will be powerless
to stop them.

334
00:16:02,067 --> 00:16:04,068
- I'm done being manipulated by you.

335
00:16:04,069 --> 00:16:06,137
You're going to bring my father back,

336
00:16:06,138 --> 00:16:09,907
then you and your troops
will return to the North.

337
00:16:09,908 --> 00:16:11,942
- And why would I do that?

338
00:16:11,943 --> 00:16:15,212
- Because you still need me
to open the northern portal.

339
00:16:15,213 --> 00:16:17,515
- No, I don't.

340
00:16:17,516 --> 00:16:19,750
You've served your purpose.

341
00:16:19,751 --> 00:16:20,785
- Aah!

342
00:16:35,033 --> 00:16:36,434
- Uh!

343
00:16:36,435 --> 00:16:37,802
- If we get to Varrick's boat,

344
00:16:37,803 --> 00:16:42,803
we can still save your father.
- Let's go.

345
00:16:58,523 --> 00:17:00,357
- You have a license for that animal?

346
00:17:00,358 --> 00:17:02,860
- Uh, you fellahs
seen a traveling circus

347
00:17:02,861 --> 00:17:03,961
come through here?

348
00:17:03,962 --> 00:17:05,529
- Zhu Li, do the thing.

349
00:17:07,632 --> 00:17:10,868
- That platypus-bear
is pooping money!

350
00:17:21,847 --> 00:17:24,949
- Where's your dad?
- On a ship headed north.

351
00:17:24,950 --> 00:17:26,517
Think we can catch up to it?

352
00:17:26,518 --> 00:17:30,521
- Sure, once you get us past
our friends from the North.

353
00:17:30,522 --> 00:17:33,124
- If only we had a plane
to get me close to those ships.

354
00:17:33,125 --> 00:17:35,192
I could waterbend them
out of the way.

355
00:17:35,193 --> 00:17:37,862
- A plane? Well,
why didn't you say so?

356
00:17:44,836 --> 00:17:47,404
- Um, why do you have a plane
on your boat?

357
00:17:47,405 --> 00:17:49,373
- In case the boat sinks,
of course.

358
00:17:49,374 --> 00:17:51,041
- But there's no runway.

359
00:17:51,042 --> 00:17:52,643
How are we supposed to take off?

360
00:17:52,644 --> 00:17:54,745
- Zhu Li!
Take a note:

361
00:17:54,746 --> 00:17:57,982
"Build runway."
- Yes, sir.

362
00:17:57,983 --> 00:18:02,983
- I have an idea.

363
00:18:09,394 --> 00:18:14,394
. Now!

364
00:18:51,203 --> 00:18:56,203
- Captain, you are never
gonna believe this.

365
00:19:00,612 --> 00:19:02,913
- There!
My dad's on that ship!

366
00:19:09,287 --> 00:19:14,287
Jump!

367
00:19:27,505 --> 00:19:29,073
- Whoo-ah!

368
00:19:34,479 --> 00:19:35,846
- Where are the prisoners?

369
00:19:39,618 --> 00:19:41,051
- Korra, this is crazy.

370
00:19:41,052 --> 00:19:43,387
You promised me
you wouldn't do anything rash.

371
00:19:43,388 --> 00:19:48,388
- I had to.
I'll explain later.

372
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:04,208
- Sweetie! You're okay!

373
00:20:04,209 --> 00:20:07,144
Oh! I was so worried!

374
00:20:07,145 --> 00:20:10,047
Do you have something
you wanna say to your sister?

375
00:20:10,048 --> 00:20:12,082
- Ikki, I'm glad you're back.

376
00:20:12,083 --> 00:20:15,019
- Yeah, sorry
we made fun of you.

377
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:17,855
- Thanks.
Wanna play air ball?

378
00:20:17,856 --> 00:20:22,856
- Sure!
- Yeah!

379
00:20:23,461 --> 00:20:26,964
- I wanted to apologize
for how I acted yesterday.

380
00:20:26,965 --> 00:20:29,967
I've worked so hard
to celebrate Dad's legacy

381
00:20:29,968 --> 00:20:32,002
that I may have overlooked
the parts of him

382
00:20:32,003 --> 00:20:34,038
that were less than ideal.

383
00:20:34,039 --> 00:20:37,541
- And we're sorry for dumping
our frustrations with Dad

384
00:20:37,542 --> 00:20:38,575
out on you.

385
00:20:38,576 --> 00:20:40,945
- Yeah, you didn't deserve that.

386
00:20:40,946 --> 00:20:43,147
- I thought you two
might wanna see this.

387
00:20:43,148 --> 00:20:46,884
Mom gave it to me
before we left.

388
00:20:46,885 --> 00:20:50,220
- That is one
good-looking family, huh?

389
00:20:50,221 --> 00:20:54,591
- That's one happy family.

390
00:20:54,592 --> 00:20:56,460
- So once I knew the truth,

391
00:20:56,461 --> 00:20:58,729
I couldn't sit by
and do nothing.

392
00:20:58,730 --> 00:21:02,032
- My own brother betrayed me...

393
00:21:02,033 --> 00:21:03,801
and our entire tribe.

394
00:21:03,802 --> 00:21:05,602
- What's our next move?

395
00:21:05,603 --> 00:21:07,771
- I've been running from my past
for too long.

396
00:21:07,772 --> 00:21:11,141
It's time to put my brother
in his place.

397
00:21:11,142 --> 00:21:13,877
- You have our support,
Chief Tonraq.

398
00:21:13,878 --> 00:21:15,145
- Mine too.

399
00:21:15,146 --> 00:21:17,081
I'll be proud
to fight alongside you, Dad.

400
00:21:17,082 --> 00:21:18,349
- No, Korra.

401
00:21:18,350 --> 00:21:19,850
- But you said the South
doesn't stand a chance

402
00:21:19,851 --> 00:21:21,318
against Unalaq's forces.

403
00:21:21,319 --> 00:21:22,386
I can help.

404
00:21:22,387 --> 00:21:23,787
- The best way for you to help

405
00:21:23,788 --> 00:21:25,456
is by getting the President
of the United Republic

406
00:21:25,457 --> 00:21:26,824
on our side.

407
00:21:26,825 --> 00:21:29,460
The South can give Unalaq
a good fight for a while,

408
00:21:29,461 --> 00:21:33,998
but we'll need the United Forces
in order to win this war.

409
00:21:33,999 --> 00:21:38,802
- All right,
I'll get you all the help you need.

410
00:21:38,803 --> 00:21:40,304
I love you, Dad.

411
00:21:40,305 --> 00:21:45,305
- I love you too.

412
00:21:49,414 --> 00:21:51,148
- I really need to thank you, Korra.

413
00:21:51,149 --> 00:21:53,951
- For what?
I started a civil war.

414
00:21:53,952 --> 00:21:55,319
- Exactly!

415
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:57,755
Now Eska and I
are officially broken up.

416
00:21:57,756 --> 00:21:59,923
- Oh, looks like we have company,

417
00:21:59,924 --> 00:22:04,461
and not the fun kind!

418
00:22:04,462 --> 00:22:07,731
- What is that?

419
00:22:13,471 --> 00:22:15,639
- That would be my darling Eska.

420
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:17,341
Quick question:
Is this thing fast enough

421
00:22:17,342 --> 00:22:19,710
to get away from my crazy
waterbending ex-girlfriend?

422
00:22:19,711 --> 00:22:21,879
- Why do you think I built this boat?
