00:02:07,094 --> 00:02:10,098
I got nothing.
I've never really needed money.

No, it's all right. It's just...

we've been on our own.

come up with the money?

We can take Naga.

- Who's Naga?
- My best friend.

111
00:05:35,035 --> 00:05:36,605

- About noon.

123
00:06:17,344 --> 00:06:18,345
What was he doing?

124
00:06:18,345 --> 00:06:21,349
He was performing
some kind of monkey-rat circus.

125
00:06:21,348 --> 00:06:22,486
And then...

126
00:06:24,351 --> 00:06:26,353
And then what? Why'd he leave?

127
00:06:27,153 --> 00:06:30,362
Shady Shin showed up
and flashed some serious cash.

128

Sounds like there's a turf war brewing,

00:06:45,672 --> 00:06:48,380

right in the middle of it.

136

headquarters.

137
00:06:59,286 --> 00:07:01,391
Hopefully Bolin is there
and nothing's gone down yet.

a search party. Are you all right?

353
00:22:39,992 --> 00:22:40,993
Mm-mm.

354
00:22:41,694 --> 00:22:43,469
Korra, what happened?

355
00:22:44,296 --> 00:22:46,401
- Did you find your friend?
- Yes, but...

356
00:22:47,499 --> 00:22:50,343
I was at an Equalist rally. I saw Amon.

357
00:22:50,336 --> 00:22:51,371
What?

358
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:53,814
He can take people's bending away.

359
00:22:53,873 --> 00:22:56,046
- For good.
- That's...

360
00:22:56,141 --> 00:22:57,347
That's impossible.

361
00:22:57,343 --> 00:22:59,983
Only the Avatar has ever possessed
that ability.

362
00:23:00,045 --> 00:23:02,082
But I saw him do it.

363
00:23:02,915 --> 00:23:04,360
I believe you.

364
00:23:04,817 --> 00:23:07,354
I don't know how Amon has achieved
this power,

365
00:23:08,354 --> 00:23:11,358
but this means the revolution
is more dangerous than ever.

366
00:23:12,324 --> 00:23:14,270
No bender is safe.
