1
00:00:01,503 --> 00:00:03,338
- Tenzin: EARTH.

2
00:00:03,421 --> 00:00:05,089
FIRE.

3
00:00:05,173 --> 00:00:06,883
AIR.

4
00:00:06,966 --> 00:00:09,010
WATER.

5
00:00:09,093 --> 00:00:13,014
ONLY THE AVATAR CAN MASTER
ALL FOUR ELEMENTS

6
00:00:13,097 --> 00:00:15,225
AND BRING BALANCE
TO THE WORLD.

7
00:00:20,897 --> 00:00:22,440
Shiro: ZAHEER
INFILTRATED ZAOFU

8
00:00:22,524 --> 00:00:24,359
AND ATTEMPTED TO KIDNAP
THE AVATAR.

9
00:00:24,442 --> 00:00:26,611
AFTER A HARROWING BATTLE,
KORRA WAS SAVED,

10
00:00:26,694 --> 00:00:28,821
BUT SHE SOON DISCOVERED
A SHOCKING TRUTH.

11
00:00:28,905 --> 00:00:31,950
AIWEI, SU'S TRUSTED ADVISOR,
HAS BEEN WORKING WITH ZAHEER.

12
00:00:32,075 --> 00:00:34,536
THIS TRUTH SEER TURNED TRAITOR
MANAGED TO ESCAPE,

13
00:00:34,619 --> 00:00:37,163
BUT SU TASKS TEAM AVATAR
WITH TRACKING HIM DOWN.

14
00:00:37,247 --> 00:00:38,581
NOW THE HUNTED
BECOMES THE HUNTER

15
00:00:38,665 --> 00:00:40,792
AS KORRA SEARCHES
FOR ANSWERS.

16
00:00:55,807 --> 00:00:57,642
AIWEI'S DEFINITELY BEEN
THROUGH HERE.

17
00:00:57,725 --> 00:00:59,227
NICE TRACKING, GIRL.

18
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:01,646
LET'S ASK AROUND.
MAYBE SOMEONE'S SEEN HIM.

19
00:01:07,527 --> 00:01:09,487
OOH, LOOK,
THEY HAVE A MOVER POSTER OF ME.

20
00:01:09,821 --> 00:01:11,823
MUST BE BIG NUKTUK FANS.
YEAH.

21
00:01:12,282 --> 00:01:13,741
I SHOULD GO OVER
AND SAY HELLO.

22
00:01:13,825 --> 00:01:16,327
NO, THOSE ARE
WANTED POSTERS,

23
00:01:16,828 --> 00:01:18,371
AND THERE'S ONE
FOR EACH OF US.

24
00:01:19,789 --> 00:01:22,250
"WANTED BY HER MAJESTY,
THE EARTH QUEEN,

25
00:01:22,333 --> 00:01:24,252
FOR CRIMES
AGAINST THE KINGDOM."

26
00:01:24,335 --> 00:01:26,796
I'M GUESSING THIS IS BECAUSE
WE TOOK HER AIRBENDERS.

27
00:01:27,171 --> 00:01:28,715
THEY WEREN'T HERS
TO KEEP.

28
00:01:28,798 --> 00:01:32,260
I SWEAR, IF I EVER SEE HER PINCHY
LITTLE QUEEN FACE AGAIN,

29
00:01:32,343 --> 00:01:33,845
I AM GONNA...
- UH, GUYS.

30
00:01:38,808 --> 00:01:40,852
WE SHOULD GET OUT OF HERE.

31
00:01:50,194 --> 00:01:51,237
- WHERE IS EVERYONE?

32
00:01:51,321 --> 00:01:52,989
I'VE BEEN WAITING TO LEAVE
FOR HALF AN HOUR.

33
00:01:53,072 --> 00:01:54,741
AND GOOD MORNING
TO YOU TOO, LIN.

34
00:01:54,824 --> 00:01:56,451
NOW, DON'T GET MAD.
KORRA'S FINE.

35
00:01:56,534 --> 00:01:58,536
I'M JUST WAITING TO HEAR
IF SHE TRACKED DOWN AIWEI YET.

36
00:01:58,995 --> 00:02:00,663
WHAT?
YOU LET KORRA GO?

37
00:02:01,039 --> 00:02:02,874
I THOUGHT WE WERE
ON THE SAME PAGE ABOUT THIS,

38
00:02:03,166 --> 00:02:04,876
AND THEN YOU GO STAB ME
IN THE BACK?

39
00:02:05,043 --> 00:02:06,794
OH, DON'T BE
SO OVERDRAMATIC.

40
00:02:06,878 --> 00:02:09,464
YOU CAN'T CONTROL
THE AVATAR'S EVERY MOVE.

41
00:02:09,547 --> 00:02:11,049
- I CAN TRY.

42
00:02:24,812 --> 00:02:26,898
- NAGA FOUND SOMETHING.

43
00:02:34,906 --> 00:02:37,742
OH, SORRY.
I FORGOT TO BRING TREATS.

44
00:02:37,825 --> 00:02:39,452
BUT GOOD GIRL.

45
00:02:45,166 --> 00:02:46,459
- THIS MUST BE AIWEI'S JEEP.

46
00:02:46,542 --> 00:02:48,127
HE CAN'T BE FAR.

47
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:51,506
BOLIN AND I WILL INVESTIGATE
THE MISTY PALMS OASIS

48
00:02:51,589 --> 00:02:53,007
AND SEE
IF HE'S HOLED UP THERE.

49
00:02:53,091 --> 00:02:55,259
YES, I LOVE IT
WHEN YOU TALK LIKE A COP.

50
00:02:55,343 --> 00:02:56,969
- I'M COMING TOO.
- NO.

51
00:02:57,136 --> 00:02:59,055
YOU AND ASAMI WAIT HERE
IN CASE HE COMES BACK.

52
00:02:59,514 --> 00:03:01,808
BESIDES, WE DON'T WANT TO CALL TOO
MUCH ATTENTION TO OURSELVES.

53
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:03,559
- ALL RIGHT.
- OOH.

54
00:03:03,643 --> 00:03:05,228
MAKO, MAKO, MAKO,
WE SHOULD WEAR DISGUISES

55
00:03:05,311 --> 00:03:06,688
AND PRETEND
WE'RE GOING UNDERCOVER.

56
00:03:06,896 --> 00:03:09,232
THAT WAY,
NO ONE WILL RECOGNIZE US.

57
00:03:09,315 --> 00:03:12,235
POLICE WORK IS SO EXCITING.

58
00:03:19,784 --> 00:03:22,370
ALL RIGHT, NOW WE NEED
OUR UNDERCOVER IDENTITIES.

59
00:03:22,578 --> 00:03:26,207
I'M AN EX-UNITED FORCES
OPERATIVE NAMED TING-TING.

60
00:03:26,541 --> 00:03:28,126
WAR WAS THE ONLY WOMAN
I EVER LOVED,

61
00:03:28,209 --> 00:03:30,878
UNTIL IVY CAME ALONG
AND SHOWED ME WHAT REAL LOVE IS.

62
00:03:31,295 --> 00:03:32,380
TRAGICALLY,
SHE WAS TAKEN FROM ME

63
00:03:32,463 --> 00:03:34,882
BY MY ARCHENEMY DR. RAZOR,
AND HE...

64
00:03:34,966 --> 00:03:37,802
ENOUGH.
LET'S JUST FIND AIWEI.

65
00:03:37,885 --> 00:03:40,221
BUT I HAVEN'T EVEN TOLD YOU
YOUR BACKSTORY.

66
00:03:40,346 --> 00:03:42,724
I'M A COP.
I DON'T HAVE A BACKSTORY.

67
00:03:42,807 --> 00:03:45,059
- OOH, YOU'RE GOOD AT THIS.

68
00:04:05,455 --> 00:04:07,582
SHOO.
HUMAN CUSTOMERS ONLY.

69
00:04:07,957 --> 00:04:09,834
LET'S SEE IF THIS GUY
KNOWS ANYTHING.

70
00:04:11,127 --> 00:04:12,670
EXCUSE ME, SIR.

71
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:16,007
WE'RE LOOKING FOR A MAN
ABOUT 60, BALDING,

72
00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:18,092
WEARING GLASSES
AND A LONG GREEN ROBE.

73
00:04:18,176 --> 00:04:19,761
AND HE'S GOT
THIS WEIRD PIERCING

74
00:04:19,844 --> 00:04:21,721
THAT GOES FROM HIS NOSE
TO HIS EAR.

75
00:04:21,846 --> 00:04:23,514
FREAKS ME OUT.
- YEAH, SURE.

76
00:04:23,848 --> 00:04:25,767
SOUNDS LIKE A GUY
WHO CAME IN LAST NIGHT.

77
00:04:26,267 --> 00:04:28,186
I TOLD HIM I HAD
THE BEST DRINKS IN THE EARTH KINGDOM,

78
00:04:28,269 --> 00:04:29,604
AND HE CALLED ME A LIAR.

79
00:04:29,687 --> 00:04:32,023
THAT'S HIM.
ANY IDEA WHERE HE IS NOW?

80
00:04:32,273 --> 00:04:34,859
NO, AFRAID NOT.
BUT HE WAS RIGHT.

81
00:04:35,526 --> 00:04:37,445
MY DRINKS ARE TERRIBLE.

82
00:04:44,702 --> 00:04:46,120
ARE YOU OKAY?

83
00:04:46,204 --> 00:04:47,955
- I'M JUST FRUSTRATED.

84
00:04:48,039 --> 00:04:49,290
WHAT DOES ZAHEER
WANT WITH ME?

85
00:04:49,373 --> 00:04:50,458
WHAT'S HIS PLAN?

86
00:04:51,793 --> 00:04:54,712
I DON'T KNOW,
BUT I THINK I FOUND A CLUE.

87
00:04:59,217 --> 00:05:01,093
"XAI BAU'S GROVE,
SUNDOWN."

88
00:05:01,427 --> 00:05:04,347
THIS MUST BE WHERE AND WHEN
AIWEI'S GOING TO MEET ZAHEER.

89
00:05:08,434 --> 00:05:10,311
ALL RIGHT,
XAI BAU'S GROVE,

90
00:05:11,437 --> 00:05:12,980
WHERE ARE YOU?

91
00:05:15,608 --> 00:05:17,652
GO AWAY.
I'M TRYING TO FIND SOMETHING.

92
00:05:23,616 --> 00:05:25,326
WELL, AREN'T YOU
A CUTE LITTLE...

93
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:27,245
OW! HEY!

94
00:05:35,503 --> 00:05:36,504
- NO LUCK HERE.

95
00:05:36,587 --> 00:05:37,922
I THINK THERE MIGHT BE
A COUPLE BOUNTY HUNTERS

96
00:05:38,005 --> 00:05:39,340
OVER THERE
WHO RECOGNIZE ME.

97
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,677
WE'VE BEEN MADE.
LET'S LOSE 'EM.

98
00:05:56,023 --> 00:05:58,025
OKAY, I THINK WE'RE CLEAR.

99
00:05:58,109 --> 00:05:59,151
WE SHOULD HEAD BACK
TO KORRA

100
00:05:59,235 --> 00:06:00,945
BEFORE SOMEONE ELSE
RECOGNIZES US.

101
00:06:02,488 --> 00:06:03,823
- WE COULD, OR

102
00:06:03,906 --> 00:06:05,533
WE COULD FOLLOW AIWEI
INSTEAD.

103
00:06:05,616 --> 00:06:06,742
LOOK.

104
00:06:10,371 --> 00:06:12,707
ALL RIGHT, PLAY IT COOL.
FOLLOW MY LEAD.

105
00:06:13,541 --> 00:06:15,501
TING-TING
ALWAYS FINDS HIS MAN.

106
00:06:29,891 --> 00:06:32,768
KEEP AN EYE ON HIM.
I'LL GO GET KORRA.

107
00:06:34,312 --> 00:06:35,980
WE FOUND AIWEI
HIDING IN AN INN.

108
00:06:36,689 --> 00:06:38,733
THAT'S GREAT.
WE FOUND SOMETHING TOO.

109
00:06:39,358 --> 00:06:41,485
IT LOOKS LIKE HE'S GOING
TO MEET ZAHEER AT SUNDOWN

110
00:06:41,569 --> 00:06:43,487
AT A PLACE
CALLED XAI BAU'S GROVE,

111
00:06:44,113 --> 00:06:46,157
BUT I CAN'T FIND IT ANYWHERE
ON THE MAP.

112
00:06:46,532 --> 00:06:47,658
LET'S GO BUST
AIWEI'S DOOR DOWN

113
00:06:47,742 --> 00:06:49,201
AND FINALLY GET SOME ANSWERS.

114
00:06:49,493 --> 00:06:52,163
NO, ONCE AIWEI KNOWS
WE'RE ON TO HIM,

115
00:06:52,246 --> 00:06:53,331
WE LOSE OUR ADVANTAGE.

116
00:06:53,748 --> 00:06:55,207
I SAY WE STAKE OUT HIS ROOM,

117
00:06:55,291 --> 00:06:56,417
AND WHEN HE LEAVES
FOR THIS MEETING,

118
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:57,501
WE FOLLOW HIM.

119
00:06:57,585 --> 00:06:59,670
AND HE'LL LEAD US
STRAIGHT TO ZAHEER.

120
00:07:15,186 --> 00:07:16,145
- GOOD AFTERNOON.

121
00:07:16,228 --> 00:07:17,772
WE'D LIKE A ROOM
ON THE GROUND FLOOR

122
00:07:17,855 --> 00:07:19,315
ACROSS FROM 102, PLEASE.

123
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:21,943
FORGET IT. LAST TIME A BUNCH OF
TEENAGERS CAME IN HERE,

124
00:07:22,026 --> 00:07:23,694
THEY TRASHED THE WHOLE ROOM.

125
00:07:25,029 --> 00:07:26,572
- WE FOUND YOU.

126
00:07:29,408 --> 00:07:32,203
HEY, NO BENDING IN HERE.
TAKE IT OUTSIDE.

127
00:07:32,995 --> 00:07:35,331
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.
WE'RE NOT HERE TO FIGHT YOU.

128
00:07:35,706 --> 00:07:36,958
WE'RE HERE TO MEET NUKTUK.

129
00:07:40,419 --> 00:07:41,796
- WE'RE YOUR BIGGEST FANS.

130
00:07:44,131 --> 00:07:46,968
COULD YOU MAKE IT OUT
TO LILY AND MACAO?

131
00:07:47,051 --> 00:07:51,013
UH, I'D BE HAPPY TO.
ALWAYS LOVE MEETING MY FANS.

132
00:07:58,521 --> 00:08:00,606
I MADE THIS NUKTUK DOLL
FOR YOU.

133
00:08:03,776 --> 00:08:06,362
- AW, IT'S CUTE.

134
00:08:07,947 --> 00:08:11,409
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME
YOUR FRIEND WAS A MOVER STAR?

135
00:08:11,617 --> 00:08:14,495
I'D BE HAPPY TO RENT YOU
ANY ROOM IN THE INN.

136
00:08:14,578 --> 00:08:16,998
WE'LL JUST TAKE THE ONE
ACROSS FROM 102.

137
00:08:17,081 --> 00:08:19,417
BUT THAT ROOM IS TOO SMALL
FOR THE FOUR OF YOU.

138
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,794
TRUST ME.
IT'LL BE PERFECT.

139
00:08:22,753 --> 00:08:24,088
I'D JUST LIKE TO STATE
FOR THE RECORD

140
00:08:24,171 --> 00:08:26,215
THAT THIS ROOM
IS NOT PERFECT.

141
00:08:27,425 --> 00:08:29,927
NAGA!

142
00:08:34,974 --> 00:08:36,475
- THERE HE IS.

143
00:08:43,024 --> 00:08:44,984
I THOUGHT STAKEOUTS
WERE SUPPOSED TO BE EXCITING.

144
00:08:45,276 --> 00:08:46,944
THIS ISN'T AT ALL.

145
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,781
OOH, I WONDER
IF THERE'S ANY SNACKS IN HERE.

146
00:08:55,786 --> 00:08:56,954
HEY, LOOK!

147
00:08:57,121 --> 00:08:59,623
A PAI SHO BOARD.
MAKO, YOU WANT TO PLAY?

148
00:08:59,749 --> 00:09:00,958
- KIND OF BUSY HERE, BRO.

149
00:09:01,959 --> 00:09:04,420
- I'LL PLAY.
- OH, WELL...

150
00:09:04,503 --> 00:09:07,214
NO OFFENSE, BUT I LEARNED
STREET PAI SHO FROM SHADY SHIN,

151
00:09:07,298 --> 00:09:08,716
AND I AM PRETTY GOOD,

152
00:09:08,799 --> 00:09:10,718
SO WOULDN'T REALLY BE
A FAIR GAME.

153
00:09:11,052 --> 00:09:13,054
SO? I LEARNED TO PLAY
FROM MY DAD,

154
00:09:13,137 --> 00:09:14,805
THE DIABOLICAL GENIUS.

155
00:09:14,889 --> 00:09:15,931
I'LL DESTROY YOU.

156
00:09:16,307 --> 00:09:19,018
WELL, LOOKS LIKE
WE HAVE OURSELVES

157
00:09:19,101 --> 00:09:20,686
A PAI SHO-DOWN.

158
00:09:26,317 --> 00:09:27,777
LADIES FIRST.

159
00:09:39,371 --> 00:09:40,539
- HMM.

160
00:09:41,457 --> 00:09:43,876
I DON'T WANT TO RUSH YOU,
BUT LET'S SPEED THINGS UP A BIT.

161
00:09:43,959 --> 00:09:45,044
- WHY?

162
00:09:45,169 --> 00:09:48,089
THIS GAME IS ALL ABOUT SLOW,
METHODICAL STRATEGY.

163
00:09:48,172 --> 00:09:49,799
NO, IT'S NOT;
THIS IS A FAST-PACED,

164
00:09:49,924 --> 00:09:51,550
EDGE-OF-YOUR-SEAT
GAME OF CHANCE.

165
00:09:51,634 --> 00:09:52,927
DON'T THINK.
JUST GO.

166
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:54,553
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT SHADY SHIN TAUGHT YOU,

167
00:09:54,637 --> 00:09:56,931
BUT IT WASN'T
THE REAL PAI SHO.

168
00:09:57,056 --> 00:09:58,224
- OH, REALLY?

169
00:09:58,307 --> 00:10:00,059
I THINK OUR FRIEND
MR. RULE BOOK

170
00:10:00,142 --> 00:10:01,685
MIGHT DISAGREE WITH YOU.

171
00:10:01,769 --> 00:10:05,815
"THE ORIGINS OF PAI SHO
DATE BACK OVER 10,000 YEARS.

172
00:10:05,898 --> 00:10:08,526
IT IS A GAME OF BOTH STRATEGY
AND CHANCE."

173
00:10:10,361 --> 00:10:13,030
WAIT, HOW COULD IT BE BOTH?
- LET ME SEE THAT.

174
00:10:13,614 --> 00:10:15,282
"THERE HAVE BEEN
COUNTLESS VARIATIONS

175
00:10:15,366 --> 00:10:16,784
"OF PAI SHO
THROUGH THE CENTURIES,

176
00:10:16,867 --> 00:10:20,121
"AND EACH CULTURE
HAS ITS OWN RULES

177
00:10:20,204 --> 00:10:21,580
AND VARIATIONS ON THE GAME."

178
00:10:21,664 --> 00:10:22,873
- THAT'S NO HELP AT ALL.

179
00:10:22,957 --> 00:10:24,083
KORRA, AS THE AVATAR,

180
00:10:24,166 --> 00:10:26,043
YOU NEED TO STANDARDIZE
THESE PAI SHO RULES.

181
00:10:26,293 --> 00:10:28,462
OKAY. I'LL PUT THAT
ON MY TO-DO LIST

182
00:10:28,546 --> 00:10:29,964
RIGHT AFTER "BRINGING BACK
THE AIR NATION"

183
00:10:30,047 --> 00:10:32,133
AND "TAKING DOWN THE GROUP
THAT TRIED TO KIDNAP ME."

184
00:10:32,383 --> 00:10:33,884
THAT'S COOL.
WHENEVER YOU GET TO IT.

185
00:10:34,009 --> 00:10:36,679
ASSUMING WE DO FIND ZAHEER,
WHAT THEN?

186
00:10:36,846 --> 00:10:38,722
- THEN I MAKE HIM TALK.

187
00:10:38,806 --> 00:10:41,225
HE WAS LOCKED AWAY
FOR 13 YEARS, KORRA,

188
00:10:41,308 --> 00:10:42,601
AND NEVER BROKE.

189
00:10:42,726 --> 00:10:43,853
I DON'T THINK
A LITTLE BENDING

190
00:10:43,936 --> 00:10:45,354
IS GOING TO INTIMIDATE
THIS GUY.

191
00:10:45,437 --> 00:10:48,732
- YOU HAVE A BETTER IDEA?
- YEAH, WE SPY ON THEM.

192
00:10:49,066 --> 00:10:51,277
IF AIWEI AND ZAHEER DON'T KNOW
THEY'RE BEING WATCHED,

193
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,570
THEY'LL TALK FREELY.

194
00:10:52,653 --> 00:10:54,655
THEN WE'LL KNOW WHO THEY ARE
AND WHAT THEY WANT.

195
00:10:54,738 --> 00:10:56,448
- THAT'S JUST LIKE PAI SHO.

196
00:10:56,532 --> 00:10:58,242
"IN ORDER TO DEFEAT
YOUR OPPONENT,

197
00:10:58,325 --> 00:11:00,202
YOU FIRST HAVE TO KNOW
YOUR OPPONENT."

198
00:11:00,327 --> 00:11:01,829
THEN I GUESS
I KNOW YOU PRETTY WELL.

199
00:11:03,622 --> 00:11:05,166
I WIN.
- WHAT?

200
00:11:05,249 --> 00:11:06,333
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

201
00:11:06,417 --> 00:11:07,418
YOU KNOW WHAT?
THAT WAS JUST A FLUKE.

202
00:11:07,501 --> 00:11:09,253
BEST TWO OUT OF THREE.

203
00:11:10,921 --> 00:11:12,506
OH, COME ON!

204
00:11:12,965 --> 00:11:14,341
BEST FOUR OUT OF SEVEN.

205
00:11:16,969 --> 00:11:18,387
8 OUT OF 15.

206
00:11:22,099 --> 00:11:23,601
17 OUT OF 33?

207
00:11:41,619 --> 00:11:43,662
LOOKS LIKE
YOU'RE ON THE ROPES THIS TIME.

208
00:11:43,746 --> 00:11:46,415
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.
YOU MIGHT ACTUALLY WIN THIS ONE.

209
00:11:49,293 --> 00:11:50,961
- NO, PABU!

210
00:11:51,462 --> 00:11:52,755
WHY?

211
00:12:01,639 --> 00:12:04,600
IT'S ALMOST SUNDOWN.
WHY HASN'T AIWEI LEFT YET?

212
00:12:04,808 --> 00:12:06,644
MAYBE HE SLIPPED OUT
WHEN YOU WEREN'T LOOKING.

213
00:12:06,977 --> 00:12:08,896
NO, I JUST SAW HIM
PEEKING OUT THE WINDOW

214
00:12:08,979 --> 00:12:10,522
15 MINUTES AGO.

215
00:12:10,731 --> 00:12:12,483
IT'S IN MY LOGBOOK.

216
00:12:13,067 --> 00:12:15,027
- I'M GOING OVER THERE.
- KORRA, WAIT.

217
00:12:15,152 --> 00:12:16,987
YOU'RE GONNA BLOW
OUR ELEMENT OF SURPRISE.

218
00:12:23,327 --> 00:12:25,287
IT'S OVER, AIWEI.
WHERE'S...

219
00:12:26,288 --> 00:12:27,373
WHAT?

220
00:12:32,044 --> 00:12:34,880
- THAT'S A WEIRD WAY TO NAP.
- HE'S NOT SLEEPING.

221
00:12:35,506 --> 00:12:37,341
HE'S MEDITATING.
WAIT.

222
00:12:38,259 --> 00:12:40,844
ASAMI, THOSE SPIRITS WERE TRYING TO
TELL US SOMETHING EARLIER.

223
00:12:41,553 --> 00:12:43,389
XAI BAU'S GROVE
ISN'T ON THE MAP

224
00:12:43,472 --> 00:12:45,557
BECAUSE IT'S NOT
IN THE PHYSICAL WORLD.

225
00:12:46,016 --> 00:12:47,851
IT'S IN THE SPIRIT WORLD.

226
00:12:47,935 --> 00:12:49,853
I'M GOING IN AFTER HIM.

227
00:12:50,145 --> 00:12:51,772
WE'LL WATCH HIM
IN CASE HE WAKES UP.

228
00:12:53,023 --> 00:12:54,358
BE CAREFUL.

229
00:13:19,675 --> 00:13:21,260
WHAT HAPPENED
BACK IN ZAOFU?

230
00:13:21,844 --> 00:13:24,138
YOU TOLD ME
WE WOULDN'T HAVE ANY PROBLEMS

231
00:13:24,221 --> 00:13:25,514
GETTING THE AVATAR.

232
00:13:25,597 --> 00:13:27,725
BECAUSE OF YOU,
WE'VE ALL BEEN COMPROMISED.

233
00:13:27,933 --> 00:13:31,562
NO, ANY EVIDENCE WAS DESTROYED
WHEN MY LIBRARY BURNED.

234
00:13:32,563 --> 00:13:34,440
WHERE IS
YOUR PHYSICAL BODY NOW?

235
00:13:34,565 --> 00:13:36,400
- AT THE MISTY PALMS INN.

236
00:13:36,483 --> 00:13:38,986
BUT THERE IS NO NEED TO WORRY.
I WAS NOT FOLLOWED.

237
00:13:39,069 --> 00:13:40,487
- YOU LEFT A LOOSE END.

238
00:13:40,571 --> 00:13:43,657
I ASSURE YOU
NO ONE KNOWS ANYTHING ABOUT US.

239
00:13:44,199 --> 00:13:46,243
- NO, YOU ARE THE LOOSE END.

240
00:13:47,745 --> 00:13:48,746
- ZAHEER!

241
00:14:04,386 --> 00:14:06,055
IT SEEMS
AIWEI WAS MISTAKEN.

242
00:14:06,638 --> 00:14:08,724
HE WAS FOLLOWED.
- THAT'S RIGHT.

243
00:14:08,974 --> 00:14:10,768
WE KNEW HE'D LEAD US
STRAIGHT TO YOU.

244
00:14:11,101 --> 00:14:12,770
SO WHAT DID YOU DO
WITH HIM?

245
00:14:13,103 --> 00:14:16,607
HE'LL BE SPENDING ETERNITY
IN THE FOG OF LOST SOULS,

246
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:18,817
WHICH JUST LEAVES
THE TWO OF US.

247
00:14:26,075 --> 00:14:27,409
- DON'T MOVE, ZAHEER.

248
00:14:27,493 --> 00:14:29,286
YOU'RE GONNA GIVE ME
SOME ANSWERS.

249
00:14:29,536 --> 00:14:31,121
THERE'S NO NEED
FOR AGGRESSION.

250
00:14:31,205 --> 00:14:32,706
NEITHER OF US
HAS OUR BENDING,

251
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:34,333
AND I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

252
00:14:34,416 --> 00:14:35,959
I'LL ANSWER
WHATEVER QUESTIONS YOU HAVE.

253
00:14:36,585 --> 00:14:37,669
YOU DESERVE THAT MUCH.

254
00:14:40,464 --> 00:14:41,840
WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO KNOW?

255
00:14:42,966 --> 00:14:44,468
FIRST OFF,
WHO ARE YOU PEOPLE,

256
00:14:44,551 --> 00:14:46,303
AND WHY DO YOU KEEP
TRYING TO TAKE ME?

257
00:14:46,637 --> 00:14:48,764
WE ARE PART
OF A SECRET SOCIETY

258
00:14:48,847 --> 00:14:51,392
DEDICATED TO RESTORING FREEDOM
TO THE WORLD.

259
00:14:51,475 --> 00:14:54,686
WE ARE THE RED LOTUS.
- RED LOTUS?

260
00:14:56,021 --> 00:14:57,648
ARE YOU RELATED
TO THE WHITE LOTUS?

261
00:14:57,815 --> 00:15:00,025
WE ARE WHAT THE WHITE LOTUS
WAS MEANT TO BE,

262
00:15:00,484 --> 00:15:02,319
BUT AFTER THE
HUNDRED YEAR WAR,

263
00:15:02,403 --> 00:15:04,947
THE WHITE LOTUS
LOST ITS TRUE PURPOSE.

264
00:15:05,447 --> 00:15:08,784
ITS MEMBERS CAME OUT OF HIDING
AND OPENLY SERVED THE AVATAR.

265
00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:11,954
THEY BECAME NOTHING
BUT GLORIFIED BODYGUARDS

266
00:15:12,037 --> 00:15:14,081
WHO SERVED CORRUPT NATIONS,

267
00:15:14,164 --> 00:15:17,709
SO A GREAT MAN NAMED XAI BAU
BROKE FROM THE WHITE LOTUS

268
00:15:17,793 --> 00:15:19,837
AND BEGAN HIS OWN SOCIETY.

269
00:15:20,421 --> 00:15:21,588
- THAT'S A GREAT STORY,

270
00:15:21,672 --> 00:15:23,298
BUT IT DOESN'T EXPLAIN
WHY YOU TRIED TO TAKE ME

271
00:15:23,382 --> 00:15:24,425
WHEN I WAS A KID.

272
00:15:24,758 --> 00:15:27,177
- THAT WAS UNALAQ'S IDEA.

273
00:15:28,262 --> 00:15:29,430
- WHAT?

274
00:15:29,513 --> 00:15:31,932
MY UNCLE WAS PART
OF THE RED LOTUS?

275
00:15:37,438 --> 00:15:38,981
- AVATAR KORRA.

276
00:15:39,481 --> 00:15:41,275
MISTY PALMS INN.

277
00:15:42,526 --> 00:15:45,404
FIND HER.
- YOU TWO GO.

278
00:15:45,696 --> 00:15:47,823
I'LL STAY HERE AND MAKE SURE
ZAHEER'S BODY IS SAFE.

279
00:15:50,701 --> 00:15:52,911
I MET YOUR UNCLE
WHEN I WAS A TEENAGER

280
00:15:52,995 --> 00:15:54,955
AFTER WE HAD BOTH JOINED
THE RED LOTUS.

281
00:15:55,205 --> 00:15:57,207
WE LEARNED ABOUT RAAVA
AND VAATU

282
00:15:57,291 --> 00:16:00,043
AND HOW AVATAR WAN
FOOLISHLY SEVERED THEM,

283
00:16:00,127 --> 00:16:02,254
DISRUPTING THE BALANCE
OF THE WORLD FOREVER.

284
00:16:02,546 --> 00:16:04,465
- AVATAR WAN WASN'T FOOLISH.

285
00:16:04,548 --> 00:16:06,175
HE WAS TRYING
TO RESTORE BALANCE.

286
00:16:06,508 --> 00:16:09,219
HE CLOSED THE PORTALS,
SEVERING HUMANS FROM SPIRITS.

287
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:12,014
EVEN YOU REALIZE
THE ERROR IN HIS WAYS.

288
00:16:12,097 --> 00:16:15,225
SO ALL ALONG,
YOU AND MY UNCLE PLANNED TO USE ME

289
00:16:15,309 --> 00:16:17,436
TO OPEN THE PORTALS
AND RELEASE VAATU?

290
00:16:17,728 --> 00:16:20,022
THAT'S WHY YOU
TRIED TO TAKE ME WHEN I WAS A KID?

291
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:22,399
YES, AND WITH MEMBERS
OF THE RED LOTUS

292
00:16:22,483 --> 00:16:24,193
AS YOUR ELEMENTAL MASTERS,

293
00:16:24,276 --> 00:16:25,986
WE COULD'VE TAUGHT YOU
SO MUCH.

294
00:16:26,153 --> 00:16:27,738
SOUNDS LIKE YOU WANTED
TO BRAINWASH ME

295
00:16:27,821 --> 00:16:29,323
SO I'D DO
WHATEVER YOU WANTED.

296
00:16:29,406 --> 00:16:30,407
- NO, KORRA.

297
00:16:30,491 --> 00:16:32,868
ALL I WANTED
WAS TO SHOW THE AVATAR

298
00:16:32,951 --> 00:16:34,411
A BETTER PATH
FOR THE WORLD.

299
00:16:44,421 --> 00:16:46,048
- UH, I DON'T KNOW HOW,

300
00:16:46,131 --> 00:16:48,383
BUT WATER ARM LADY
AND LAVA GUY FOUND US.

301
00:16:48,467 --> 00:16:49,843
HOW?

302
00:16:49,927 --> 00:16:51,345
I JUST SAID
I DON'T KNOW HOW.

303
00:16:51,428 --> 00:16:53,055
KORRA, COME ON,
WAKE UP.

304
00:16:54,890 --> 00:16:58,143
- WHAT DO WE DO?
- GET KORRA OUT OF HERE.

305
00:17:01,063 --> 00:17:02,439
BOLIN AND I
WILL HOLD THEM OFF.

306
00:17:09,238 --> 00:17:10,405
- THE AVATAR.

307
00:17:28,298 --> 00:17:29,758
IF MY UNCLE CAME UP
WITH A PLAN

308
00:17:29,841 --> 00:17:31,301
TO ABDUCT ME
WHEN I WAS A KID,

309
00:17:31,385 --> 00:17:32,636
WHY WASN'T HE CAUGHT?

310
00:17:32,886 --> 00:17:34,930
HE WASN'T WITH US
THAT NIGHT,

311
00:17:35,013 --> 00:17:37,307
AND HE COVERED UP
HIS INVOLVEMENT AFTERWARDS.

312
00:17:38,016 --> 00:17:40,519
SO HE BETRAYED YOU
JUST LIKE HE BETRAYED ME.

313
00:17:41,144 --> 00:17:43,522
YES, HE ALLOWED ME
AND MY FRIENDS

314
00:17:43,605 --> 00:17:44,690
TO REMAIN IMPRISONED

315
00:17:44,773 --> 00:17:47,150
WHILE HE PURSUED
HIS OWN SELFISH GOALS.

316
00:17:47,568 --> 00:17:51,154
UNALAQ BECOMING A DARK AVATAR
WAS NEVER PART OF OUR MISSION.

317
00:17:51,572 --> 00:17:53,615
AND WHAT IS YOUR MISSION
EXACTLY?

318
00:17:54,074 --> 00:17:55,576
- I WANT WHAT YOU WANT,

319
00:17:55,659 --> 00:17:57,327
TO RESTORE BALANCE
TO THIS WORLD.

320
00:17:57,911 --> 00:18:00,163
I DON'T THINK OUR IDEAS
OF BALANCE ARE THE SAME.

321
00:18:00,497 --> 00:18:02,332
- ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THAT?

322
00:18:02,416 --> 00:18:04,501
YOU KEPT
THE SPIRIT PORTALS OPEN,

323
00:18:04,585 --> 00:18:06,211
BUT WHY STOP THERE?

324
00:18:06,295 --> 00:18:09,548
BRINGING THE SPIRITS BACK
SHOULD ONLY BE THE BEGINNING.

325
00:18:09,631 --> 00:18:10,632
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

326
00:18:10,757 --> 00:18:13,093
THE IDEA OF HAVING NATIONS
AND GOVERNMENTS

327
00:18:13,176 --> 00:18:14,261
IS AS FOOLISH
AS KEEPING

328
00:18:14,344 --> 00:18:16,346
THE HUMAN
AND SPIRIT REALMS SEPARATE.

329
00:18:16,888 --> 00:18:18,807
YOU'VE HAD TO DEAL
WITH A MORONIC PRESIDENT

330
00:18:19,182 --> 00:18:20,475
AND A TYRANNICAL QUEEN.

331
00:18:21,018 --> 00:18:23,270
DON'T YOU THINK THE WORLD
WOULD BE BETTER OFF

332
00:18:23,353 --> 00:18:25,897
IF LEADERS LIKE THEM
WERE ELIMINATED?

333
00:18:26,398 --> 00:18:27,524
- NO.

334
00:18:27,733 --> 00:18:30,319
I MEAN, I DON'T REALLY AGREE
WITH WHAT THEY'VE DONE,

335
00:18:30,402 --> 00:18:32,779
BUT TAKING OUT WORLD LEADERS
ISN'T THE ANSWER.

336
00:18:33,155 --> 00:18:35,407
IT WASN'T TOO LONG AGO
THAT THE AIRBENDERS

337
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:37,034
WERE NEARLY ALL WIPED OUT

338
00:18:37,117 --> 00:18:39,620
THANKS TO THE FIRE LORD'S DESIRE
FOR WORLD DOMINANCE.

339
00:18:40,078 --> 00:18:42,372
TRUE FREEDOM
CAN ONLY BE ACHIEVED

340
00:18:42,456 --> 00:18:44,750
WHEN OPPRESSIVE GOVERNMENTS
ARE TORN DOWN.

341
00:18:44,833 --> 00:18:46,501
BUT THAT WON'T
BRING BALANCE.

342
00:18:46,585 --> 00:18:48,128
IT WILL THROW THE WORLD
INTO CHAOS.

343
00:18:49,713 --> 00:18:50,839
- EXACTLY.

344
00:18:50,922 --> 00:18:53,342
THE NATURAL ORDER
IS DISORDER.

345
00:18:54,926 --> 00:18:56,386
DO YOU KNOW WHO ONCE SAID,

346
00:18:56,470 --> 00:18:59,056
"NEW GROWTH CANNOT EXIST
WITHOUT FIRST

347
00:18:59,139 --> 00:19:00,974
THE DESTRUCTION
OF THE OLD"?

348
00:19:01,058 --> 00:19:02,059
- NO.

349
00:19:02,476 --> 00:19:05,729
THE WISE GURU LAGHIMA,
AN AIRBENDER.

350
00:19:22,371 --> 00:19:23,580
I CAN'T BEAT THIS GUY.

351
00:19:23,664 --> 00:19:25,624
IT'S LIKE
I'M GIVING HIM AMMO.

352
00:19:25,707 --> 00:19:27,209
WANT TO TRADE?

353
00:20:10,794 --> 00:20:12,045
- GO GET THE AVATAR.

354
00:20:12,129 --> 00:20:13,755
I HAVE THESE TWO
UNDER CONTROL.

355
00:20:38,321 --> 00:20:41,575
YOU KNOW, BEING LOCKED AWAY
FOR SO MANY YEARS,

356
00:20:41,658 --> 00:20:43,201
I WAS BEGINNING
TO LOSE HOPE,

357
00:20:44,995 --> 00:20:46,747
BUT WHEN I AWOKE
WITH AIRBENDING,

358
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:49,916
I KNEW I WOULD BE THE ONE
TO DESTROY THE OLD WORLD

359
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,753
AND PLANT SEEDS
FOR A NEW WORLD TO FLOURISH.

360
00:20:53,628 --> 00:20:55,964
ZAHEER, PLEASE,
AS AN AIRBENDER,

361
00:20:56,047 --> 00:20:58,216
YOU COULD HELP MAKE A POSITIVE
DIFFERENCE IN THE WORLD

362
00:20:58,300 --> 00:20:59,843
INSTEAD OF DESTROYING IT.

363
00:20:59,926 --> 00:21:01,928
YOU'RE A VERY SMART
YOUNG WOMAN, KORRA,

364
00:21:02,012 --> 00:21:04,931
BUT YOU MUST REALIZE
THAT ONCE CHANGE BEGINS,

365
00:21:05,015 --> 00:21:07,768
IT CANNOT BE STOPPED,
EVEN BY THE AVATAR.

366
00:21:07,934 --> 00:21:10,270
ENOUGH WITH
YOUR PHILOSOPHICAL MUMBO JUMBO.

367
00:21:10,479 --> 00:21:11,730
I WANT TO KNOW ONE THING:

368
00:21:11,855 --> 00:21:14,357
IF YOU DO CAPTURE ME,
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO WITH ME?

369
00:21:14,483 --> 00:21:16,526
YOU'LL HAVE THAT ANSWER
SOON ENOUGH.

370
00:21:16,610 --> 00:21:18,195
THE RED LOTUS
SHOULD HAVE YOU BY NOW.

371
00:21:18,945 --> 00:21:20,155
SEE YOU
IN THE PHYSICAL WORLD.

372
00:21:21,364 --> 00:21:22,699
- ZAHEER!

373
00:21:32,751 --> 00:21:34,878
ZAHEER, YOU TRICKED ME.

374
00:21:35,045 --> 00:21:36,379
LET ME GO!

375
00:21:36,713 --> 00:21:38,507
ASAMI, ARE YOU OKAY?

376
00:21:39,049 --> 00:21:40,634
WHERE'S THE REST
OF THE RED LOTUS?

377
00:21:41,051 --> 00:21:42,636
- WHAT'S THE RED LOTUS?

378
00:21:42,719 --> 00:21:45,597
AND ZAHEER DIDN'T CAPTURE US.
THE EARTH QUEEN'S FORCES DID.

379
00:21:46,223 --> 00:21:48,475
- WHERE ARE WE?
- I'M NOT SURE.

380
00:21:48,558 --> 00:21:50,310
SOME CAMP BY THE DESERT.

381
00:21:50,393 --> 00:21:52,270
THEY'RE TAKING US BACK
TO BA SING SE.

382
00:21:56,483 --> 00:21:58,485
THE EARTH QUEEN'S ARMY
SNATCHED UP THE AVATAR

383
00:21:58,568 --> 00:21:59,736
BEFORE I COULD.

384
00:22:00,737 --> 00:22:03,365
BUT WE FIGURED
YOU COULD FIND A USE FOR THESE TWO.

385
00:22:05,283 --> 00:22:06,284
LOAD THEM
IN THE TRUCK.

386
00:22:06,743 --> 00:22:09,120
WE'RE TAKING A TRIP
TO BA SING SE.
