EXACTLY?

TO RESTORE BALANCE
TO THIS WORLD.

344

YOU KEPT
THE SPIRIT PORTALS OPEN,

BUT WHY STOP THERE?

348
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,875
BRINGING THE SPIRITS BACK
SHOULD ONLY BE THE BEGINNING.

349

- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

350
00:18:16,417 --> 00:18:18,500
- THE IDEA OF HAVING NATIONS
AND GOVERNMENTS

351
00:18:18,542 --> 00:18:19,959
IS AS FOOLISH
AS KEEPING

352
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,125

AND SPIRIT REALMS SEPARATE.

353
00:18:22,166 --> 00:18:24,417

CAN ONLY BE ACHIEVED

WHEN OPPRESSIVE GOVERNMENTS
ARE TORN DOWN.

365
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:51,917
