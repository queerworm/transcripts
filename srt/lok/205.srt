1
00:00:07,667 --> 00:00:08,625
- EARTH.

2
00:00:08,667 --> 00:00:10,917
FIRE.

3
00:00:10,959 --> 00:00:12,500
AIR.

4
00:00:12,542 --> 00:00:14,709
WATER.

5
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:18,917
ONLY THE AVATAR
CAN MASTER ALL FOUR ELEMENTS

6
00:00:18,959 --> 00:00:21,083
AND BRING BALANCE
TO THE WORLD.

7
00:00:27,208 --> 00:00:29,917
- IT'S BROTHER VERSUS BROTHER
IN THE WAR OF THE WATER TRIBES.

8
00:00:29,959 --> 00:00:31,542
AFTER KORRA DISCOVERED

9
00:00:31,583 --> 00:00:33,542
THAT CHIEF UNALAQ BETRAYED HER
AND HER FATHER,

10
00:00:33,583 --> 00:00:36,542
SHE TURNED AGAINST HIM,
SPARKING CIVIL WAR.

11
00:00:36,583 --> 00:00:38,542
THE SOUTHERN REBELS
RALLIED AROUND TONRAQ,

12
00:00:38,583 --> 00:00:40,125
BUT THEY ARE
VASTLY OUTNUMBERED.

13
00:00:40,166 --> 00:00:42,625
SO KORRA IS HEADED
TO REPUBLIC CITY TO SEEK AID.

14
00:00:42,667 --> 00:00:44,750
BUT WILL SHE BE ABLE
TO CONVINCE PRESIDENT RAIKO

15
00:00:44,792 --> 00:00:46,458
TO SEND TROOPS
TO HELP THE SOUTH?

16
00:01:02,667 --> 00:01:06,166
- WELCOME HOME, AVATAR.
THANKS FOR STARTING A WAR.

17
00:01:06,208 --> 00:01:08,709
- I DIDN'T START A WAR.

18
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:11,500
WELL, I DID,
BUT IT'S MORE COMPLICATED

19
00:01:11,542 --> 00:01:12,792
THAN YOU'RE MAKING IT SEEM.

20
00:01:12,834 --> 00:01:14,709
- MAKO, I WANT YOU
BACK ON THE BEAT.

21
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:17,500
THERE'S GOING TO BE A SOUTHERN
WATER TRIBE PEACE MARCH TONIGHT.

22
00:01:17,542 --> 00:01:19,792
I NEED YOU THERE TO MAKE SURE
THINGS DON'T GET OUT OF HAND.

23
00:01:19,834 --> 00:01:21,208
- I'M ALL YOURS.

24
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:22,458
- I'LL GO TOO.

25
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,125
THE PEOPLE
OF THE SOUTH NEED TO SEE

26
00:01:24,166 --> 00:01:25,709
THAT THE AVATAR
IS ON THEIR SIDE

27
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:27,583
IN THE FIGHT
AGAINST THE NORTHERN INVADERS.

28
00:01:27,625 --> 00:01:30,500
- GREAT.
THAT SHOULD CALM THEM DOWN.

29
00:01:30,542 --> 00:01:33,000
- MAYBE YOU SHOULD SIT THIS OUT.
- WHAT?

30
00:01:33,041 --> 00:01:35,333
- I JUST THINK HAVING YOU THERE
BLATANTLY SUPPORTING ONE SIDE

31
00:01:35,375 --> 00:01:36,625
WILL ONLY MAKE THINGS WORSE.

32
00:01:36,667 --> 00:01:38,500
YOU COULD AT LEAST
TRY TO SEEM NEUTRAL.

33
00:01:38,542 --> 00:01:41,166
- I'M NOT NEUTRAL.
THE NORTH INVADED MY HOME.

34
00:01:41,208 --> 00:01:43,083
THE ONLY REASON I'M HERE

35
00:01:43,125 --> 00:01:45,709
IS TO GET THE REPUBLIC TO
SEND TROOPS TO HELP THE SOUTH.

36
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:47,083
- ZHU LI'S ALREADY SCHEDULED
A MEETING FOR US

37
00:01:47,125 --> 00:01:48,792
WITH PRESIDENT RAIKO TOMORROW.

38
00:01:48,834 --> 00:01:50,458
WE'LL GET HIM ON BOARD.

39
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:52,083
- WHATEVER.
I GOTTA GO TO WORK.

40
00:01:52,125 --> 00:01:53,667
- I BETTER
GO CHECK ON MY FACTORY.

41
00:01:53,709 --> 00:01:55,417
- I'M GOING TO FIND OUT
ABOUT THIS PEACE MARCH.

42
00:01:55,458 --> 00:01:58,458
- AND I AM DYING
FOR A PEDICURE!

43
00:02:01,375 --> 00:02:03,959
- SO, UH,
WHAT SHOULD I BE DOING?

44
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,417
- I DON'T KNOW, BOLIN.

45
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:09,083
FIGURE SOMETHING OUT.

46
00:02:09,125 --> 00:02:12,542
- SAY, KID, HAVE YOU EVER SEEN
REPUBLIC CITY AT NIGHT?

47
00:02:12,583 --> 00:02:14,166
[Pabu squeaks]
- SURE, I LIVE HERE.

48
00:02:14,208 --> 00:02:15,834
- HAVE YOU<i> REALLY</i> SEEN IT?

49
00:02:15,875 --> 00:02:17,750
- Y--NO?

50
00:02:17,792 --> 00:02:20,125
- [chuckles]
THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT.

51
00:02:20,166 --> 00:02:23,125
COME ON.

52
00:02:23,166 --> 00:02:25,375
- TONRAQ AND THE REBELS
ARE HOLED UP HERE

53
00:02:25,417 --> 00:02:27,083
IN THE HILLS
OUTSIDE OF TOWN.

54
00:02:27,125 --> 00:02:28,750
- LEAVE THEM.

55
00:02:28,792 --> 00:02:30,166
MY BROTHER'S
NO THREAT TO US UP THERE.

56
00:02:30,208 --> 00:02:32,625
INCREASE SECURITY
AROUND THE SPIRIT PORTAL.

57
00:02:32,667 --> 00:02:35,041
KEEPING IT SAFE
IS OUR NUMBER ONE PRIORITY.

58
00:02:35,083 --> 00:02:36,750
- YES, SIR.

59
00:02:41,291 --> 00:02:43,208
[groans]

60
00:02:46,667 --> 00:02:49,208
- I NEED YOU TWO
TO GO AFTER THE AVATAR.

61
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:52,291
SHE'S THE ONLY ONE WHO CAN OPEN
THE NORTHERN SPIRIT PORTAL.

62
00:02:52,333 --> 00:02:55,125
- BUT, FATHER,
YOU TOLD KORRA--

63
00:02:55,166 --> 00:02:57,500
- I TOLD KORRA WHAT I THOUGHT
SHE NEEDED TO HEAR.

64
00:02:57,542 --> 00:03:00,750
- I'LL FIND HER.
SHE STOLE MY HUSBAND.

65
00:03:00,792 --> 00:03:03,125
- I NEED HER ALIVE.

66
00:03:03,166 --> 00:03:04,834
- [sighs]
FINE.

67
00:03:09,583 --> 00:03:12,458
[Poki chirps]
- WATCH ME, POKI.

68
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:15,583
YOU LAY DOWN AND ROLL OVER.

69
00:03:15,625 --> 00:03:18,166
ROLL OVER.

70
00:03:18,208 --> 00:03:20,709
- NO, NO, YOU CAN'T
JUST DEMONSTRATE IT.

71
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:21,959
THAT NEVER WORKS.

72
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,917
[Poki chirps]

73
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:28,041
- GOOD.

74
00:03:28,083 --> 00:03:29,458
[Poki chirps]

75
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,250
- UGH, CLASSIC OVER-REWARDING.

76
00:03:31,291 --> 00:03:33,208
[bird screeches]

77
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:34,458
[Poki coos]

78
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,208
- POKI, WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

79
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:38,000
- COMMAND RESPECT.

80
00:03:38,041 --> 00:03:39,750
[grumbles]

81
00:03:39,792 --> 00:03:41,625
[Poki chirps]

82
00:03:41,667 --> 00:03:42,959
HAVING SOME TROUBLE, SON?

83
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,125
- POKI ISN'T
VERY GOOD AT LEARNING.

84
00:03:45,166 --> 00:03:47,542
- BELIEVE ME,
I KNOW THE FEELING.

85
00:03:47,583 --> 00:03:49,208
MAYBE I CAN HELP.

86
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:50,750
HOW WOULD YOU LIKE
YOUR OLD DAD

87
00:03:50,792 --> 00:03:52,291
TO TEACH YOU
HOW TO BE A MASTER TRAINER?

88
00:03:52,333 --> 00:03:54,500
- YEAH!

89
00:03:54,542 --> 00:03:57,458
[indistinct chatter]

90
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:09,166
- TENSIONS ARE RUNNING HIGH

91
00:04:09,208 --> 00:04:12,000
OUTSIDE OF THE SOUTHERN WATER
TRIBE CULTURAL CENTER.

92
00:04:12,041 --> 00:04:13,917
THE AVATAR IS LEADING
A GROUP OF SOUTHERNERS

93
00:04:13,959 --> 00:04:16,917
IN A PEACEFUL PROTEST
AGAINST CHIEF UNALAQ,

94
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:19,125
BUT THE NORTHERNERS
HAVE COME OUT IN DROVES

95
00:04:19,166 --> 00:04:20,917
IN SUPPORT OF THEIR LEADER.

96
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:22,500
[angry crowd chatter]
- BOO!

97
00:04:22,542 --> 00:04:24,458
- GET OUT OF HERE!

98
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:28,000
- BOO!
- GET A REAL JOB!

99
00:04:28,041 --> 00:04:30,709
- GET OUT OF HERE!
- YOU STINK!

100
00:04:41,333 --> 00:04:42,792
[can crushes]

101
00:04:42,834 --> 00:04:45,166
- HEY!

102
00:04:45,208 --> 00:04:46,458
STOP!

103
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:49,291
REPUBLIC CITY POLICE.

104
00:04:49,333 --> 00:04:51,291
[electrical humming]

105
00:05:18,291 --> 00:05:21,542
- [grunts]

106
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,458
[tires screech]

107
00:05:39,917 --> 00:05:42,208
- THE NORTHERN WATER TRIBE
IS OUT OF CONTROL.

108
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:45,291
- I SAW A FIREBENDER
RUNNING AWAY FROM THE BLAST.

109
00:05:45,333 --> 00:05:47,417
THE NORTH MIGHT NOT BE
RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS.

110
00:05:47,458 --> 00:05:48,750
- OF COURSE THEY'RE RESPONSIBLE.
[siren blares]

111
00:05:48,792 --> 00:05:50,417
WHO ELSE WOULD IT BE?

112
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:03,583
[cheers and applause]

113
00:06:06,875 --> 00:06:09,166
- WOW.

114
00:06:09,208 --> 00:06:11,583
USUALLY, WHEN I SEE
FLASHING LIGHTS LIKE THIS,

115
00:06:11,625 --> 00:06:13,959
IT'S BECAUSE I GOT HIT
IN THE HEAD WITH A ROCK.

116
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
- BEING FAMOUS IS LIKE
GETTING HIT WITH A ROCK

117
00:06:16,041 --> 00:06:18,417
ALL THE TIME.

118
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,750
- LOOK!
IT'S BOLIN!

119
00:06:24,792 --> 00:06:27,959
all:
BOLIN! BOLIN! BOLIN!

120
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,125
BOLIN! BOLIN!
BOLIN! BOLIN!

121
00:06:32,166 --> 00:06:33,667
- FOLKS,
THAT CHEER YOU'RE HEARING

122
00:06:33,709 --> 00:06:36,000
IS FOR LOCAL FAVORITE, BOLIN,
OF THE FIRE FERRETS.

123
00:06:36,041 --> 00:06:38,000
LET'S SEE
IF WE CAN GET A QUICK INTERVIEW.

124
00:06:38,041 --> 00:06:40,458
BOLIN!

125
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,792
BOLIN, THE FIRE FERRETS
ARE OUT FOR THE SEASON.

126
00:06:42,834 --> 00:06:44,709
HOW HAVE YOU BEEN SPENDING
YOUR TIME LATELY?

127
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:48,000
- WELL, I TOOK A TRIP SOUTH FOR
THE GLACIER SPIRITS FESTIVAL,

128
00:06:48,041 --> 00:06:49,875
WAS BRIEFLY ENGAGED
TO A PRINCESS,

129
00:06:49,917 --> 00:06:52,625
THEN WENT THROUGH KIND OF
A TOUGH BREAKUP THERE,

130
00:06:52,667 --> 00:06:55,250
WAS ACCIDENTALLY INVOLVED
IN A CIVIL WAR...

131
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:58,458
- [coughs]

132
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,542
- BUT THERE'S
NOWHERE I'D RATHER BE

133
00:07:00,583 --> 00:07:02,417
THAN PRO BENDING NIGHT
IN REPUBLIC CITY!

134
00:07:02,458 --> 00:07:03,750
AM I RIGHT, PEOPLE?

135
00:07:03,792 --> 00:07:06,041
REPUBLIC CITY!

136
00:07:06,083 --> 00:07:08,625
[cheers and applause]

137
00:07:08,667 --> 00:07:10,917
- DO YOU MISS
BEING IN THE RING?

138
00:07:10,959 --> 00:07:12,291
- WELL,
I DEFINITELY DON'T MISS

139
00:07:12,333 --> 00:07:13,500
GETTING HIT WITH THINGS
ALL THE TIME

140
00:07:13,542 --> 00:07:15,542
AND THE HUMILIATING LOSING.

141
00:07:15,583 --> 00:07:17,125
I MEAN,
THAT GETS PRETTY OLD.

142
00:07:17,166 --> 00:07:19,667
YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES I ACTUALLY
CRY MYSELF TO SLEEP...

143
00:07:19,709 --> 00:07:21,750
- [coughs]

144
00:07:21,792 --> 00:07:25,166
- I GUESS WHAT I MISS THE MOST
ARE THESE FANS!

145
00:07:25,208 --> 00:07:27,041
THEY'RE THE GREATEST FANS
IN THE WORLD!

146
00:07:27,083 --> 00:07:31,333
GIVE IT UP FOR THE FANS!
[cheers and applause]

147
00:07:31,375 --> 00:07:34,250
- LOOK HOW
THESE PEOPLE LOVE YOU, KID.

148
00:07:34,291 --> 00:07:36,625
THEY'RE EATING THAT CORNBALL
SPIEL RIGHT OUT OF YOUR HAND.

149
00:07:36,667 --> 00:07:39,083
- THE TRICK IS,
WHENEVER I GET CONFUSED,

150
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:41,792
I JUST SAY "REPUBLIC CITY"
OR "FANS,"

151
00:07:41,834 --> 00:07:43,542
AND THEN EVERYONE CHEERS.

152
00:07:43,583 --> 00:07:46,667
- I THINK I JUST FIGURED OUT
YOUR TRUE CALLING.

153
00:07:50,166 --> 00:07:52,166
- I HOPE PRESIDENT RAIKO
LISTENS TO US.

154
00:07:52,208 --> 00:07:53,750
- DON'T WORRY.

155
00:07:53,792 --> 00:07:56,875
I WAS A BIG CONTRIBUTOR
TO HIS ELECTION CAMPAIGN.

156
00:07:56,917 --> 00:08:00,542
HIM AND THE OTHER GUY.
GOTTA HEDGE YOUR BETS.

157
00:08:02,625 --> 00:08:06,041
- HELLO, MR. PRESIDENT.

158
00:08:06,083 --> 00:08:08,417
SIR,
THE SOUTHERN WATER TRIBE--

159
00:08:08,458 --> 00:08:09,542
- JUST A SECOND.

160
00:08:09,583 --> 00:08:13,000
KEEP SMILING.

161
00:08:13,041 --> 00:08:14,667
- EH...

162
00:08:14,709 --> 00:08:19,250
- NOW, HOW CAN I HELP THE AVATAR
AND MY MOST GENEROUS SUPPORTER?

163
00:08:19,291 --> 00:08:21,875
- UNALAQ'S TROOPS
HAVE INVADED THE SOUTH.

164
00:08:21,917 --> 00:08:24,333
WE NEED YOU TO SEND
THE UNITED FORCES TO HELP.

165
00:08:24,375 --> 00:08:27,041
- I'M VERY CONCERNED
BY WHAT'S HAPPENING DOWN THERE,

166
00:08:27,083 --> 00:08:28,834
BUT I DON'T THINK
IT'S THE REPUBLIC'S PLACE

167
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:30,792
TO INTERFERE WITH
INTERNAL WATER TRIBE MATTERS.

168
00:08:30,834 --> 00:08:33,917
- UNALAQ ISN'T EVEN THE RIGHTFUL
RULER OF THE WATER TRIBE.

169
00:08:33,959 --> 00:08:36,291
HE LIED HIS WAY
ONTO THE NORTHERN THRONE.

170
00:08:36,333 --> 00:08:37,750
- MR. PRESIDENT,

171
00:08:37,792 --> 00:08:40,166
THE REPUBLIC IS ALREADY
INVOLVED IN THIS CONFLICT.

172
00:08:40,208 --> 00:08:42,458
THE NORTH ATTACKED
OUR CULTURAL CENTER LAST NIGHT.

173
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:45,166
- BELIEVE ME, WE ARE DOING
EVERYTHING WE CAN

174
00:08:45,208 --> 00:08:47,208
TO BRING THE PEOPLE RESPONSIBLE
TO JUSTICE.

175
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:49,000
- "THE PEOPLE RESPONSIBLE"?

176
00:08:49,041 --> 00:08:50,959
WHO ELSE WOULD IT BE
BUT THE NORTHERNERS?

177
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,667
- NOW, I KNOW
THAT WHEN YOU'RE YOUNG,

178
00:08:52,709 --> 00:08:54,083
IT'S HARD
TO KEEP PERSPECTIVE--

179
00:08:54,125 --> 00:08:56,583
- YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO'S LOST PERSPECTIVE.

180
00:08:56,625 --> 00:08:59,250
I'M TRYING TO SAVE MY TRIBE,
AND YOU'RE TAKING PICTURES.

181
00:08:59,291 --> 00:09:02,458
- SENDING TROOPS IS NOT
SOMETHING I CAN DO AT THIS TIME,

182
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,542
BUT I PROMISE I WILL WORK
WITH UNALAQ AND THE SOUTH

183
00:09:04,583 --> 00:09:06,291
FOR A DIPLOMATIC SOLUTION.

184
00:09:06,333 --> 00:09:08,709
NOW, I'M SORRY,
BUT MY MIND IS MADE UP.

185
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:10,208
THIS MEETING IS OVER.

186
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:13,291
- MY FAMILY
IS GOING TO BE WIPED OUT,

187
00:09:13,333 --> 00:09:17,166
AND IT'LL BE ON YOUR HEAD
FOR DOING NOTHING ABOUT IT.

188
00:09:23,083 --> 00:09:24,667
- I CAN'T BELIEVE
THE PRESIDENT IS DOING NOTHING.

189
00:09:24,709 --> 00:09:26,709
HE--HE DOESN'T EVEN CARE.

190
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:28,583
- I'M SURE HE CARES, BUT HE
CAN'T JUST TELL HIS PEOPLE

191
00:09:28,625 --> 00:09:29,959
TO GO FIGHT A BATTLE
AT THE SOUTH POLE

192
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,208
THAT HAS NOTHING
TO DO WITH THEM.

193
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:32,834
- HOW COULD YOU TAKE HIS SIDE?

194
00:09:32,875 --> 00:09:34,750
- WHAT'S WITH YOU AND SIDES?

195
00:09:34,792 --> 00:09:36,709
WHY DO YOU ALWAYS THINK
I'M WORKING AGAINST YOU?

196
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:38,667
- WELL,
YOU'RE NOT HELPING ME.

197
00:09:38,709 --> 00:09:39,917
I'M TRYING TO GET TROOPS
TO THE SOUTH.

198
00:09:39,959 --> 00:09:41,250
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

199
00:09:41,291 --> 00:09:43,000
- I'M DOING MY JOB.

200
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:45,667
- [laughs]
WELL, EXCUSE ME, OFFICER.

201
00:09:45,709 --> 00:09:48,166
DON'T LET ME STAND IN THE WAY
OF YOU WRITING TICKETS.

202
00:09:48,208 --> 00:09:50,083
I'M JUST TRYING
TO SAVE THE WORLD.

203
00:09:50,125 --> 00:09:52,333
- WELL, YOU WOULDN'T HAVE TO IF
YOU DIDN'T KEEP MESSING IT UP.

204
00:09:52,375 --> 00:09:53,834
- I CAN'T TALK TO YOU
WHEN YOU'RE LIKE THIS.

205
00:09:53,875 --> 00:09:57,041
[door slams]
- [groans]

206
00:09:57,083 --> 00:09:59,709
YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO'S LIKE THIS!

209
00:10:04,333 --> 00:10:06,041
HEY, IN A HURRY?

210
00:10:06,083 --> 00:10:07,500
- SORRY, I HAVE
TO TALK TO VARRICK.

211
00:10:07,542 --> 00:10:10,458
- YEAH, ME TOO.

212
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:13,291

214
00:10:16,792 --> 00:10:18,208
- OH, HELLO.

215
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:19,917
SEE?
I TOLD YOU I COULD DO IT.

216
00:10:19,959 --> 00:10:22,166
- SORRY I EVER DOUBTED YOU.

217
00:10:22,208 --> 00:10:24,125
- WE CAN'T WAIT
FOR THE PRESIDENT TO ACT.

218
00:10:24,166 --> 00:10:25,834
WE NEED THOSE TROOPS NOW.

219
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:27,625
- AND MY COMPANY
IS ABOUT TO GO UNDER.

220
00:10:27,667 --> 00:10:29,542
I HAVE TO FIND A WAY
TO MAKE SOME SALES.

221
00:10:29,583 --> 00:10:31,375
- RIGHT. OKAY.
GOT IT.

222
00:10:31,417 --> 00:10:32,792
IDEA STORM.

223
00:10:32,834 --> 00:10:35,166
GET THE SUPPLIES.

224
00:10:35,208 --> 00:10:36,917
YOU'RE ABOUT TO GET
AN INSIDE LOOK

225
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:39,125
AT HOW VARRICK GLOBAL INDUSTRIES

226
00:10:39,166 --> 00:10:42,000
STAYS AT THE FOREFRONT
OF IMAGINATION INNOVATION

227
00:10:42,041 --> 00:10:44,792
OR "IMAGIVATION"!

228
00:10:44,834 --> 00:10:47,125
THAT'S TRADEMARKED, PAL.

229
00:10:49,041 --> 00:10:51,959
BRAIN WORK REQUIRES
INCREASED CIRCULATION.

230
00:10:54,875 --> 00:10:57,458
LET'S DO THIS!

231
00:10:59,458 --> 00:11:03,375
OKAY, HERE COME THE IDEAS,
FAST AND FURIOUS.

UH, HAND SHOES.

235
00:11:12,542 --> 00:11:14,083
HOLD ON A TIC.

236
00:11:14,125 --> 00:11:16,375
WE DON'T NEED THE PRESIDENT
TO GO TO THE SOUTH.

237
00:11:16,417 --> 00:11:19,417
WE JUST NEED THE TROOPS.
LET'S GO STRAIGHT TO THEM.

238
00:11:19,458 --> 00:11:21,000
IF THERE'S ONE THING
I KNOW ABOUT TROOPS,

239
00:11:21,041 --> 00:11:23,000
IT'S THAT THEY LOVE FIGHTING.

240
00:11:23,041 --> 00:11:25,917
- I KNOW GENERAL IROH.
HE MIGHT BE WILLING TO HELP US.

241
00:11:25,959 --> 00:11:28,458
- A MAN ON THE INSIDE.
PERFECT.

242
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,792
AND YOU NEED TO SELL
SOME MECHA-TANKS.

243
00:11:30,834 --> 00:11:32,875
I KNOW SOME PEOPLE
WHO NEED THEM.

244
00:11:32,917 --> 00:11:34,625
WE'LL SHIP 'EM SOUTH.

245
00:11:34,667 --> 00:11:36,041
- THAT'S PERFECT.

246
00:11:36,083 --> 00:11:37,291
YOU'LL BE MAKING MONEY
FOR YOUR COMPANY,

247
00:11:37,333 --> 00:11:39,000
AND YOU'LL BE HELPING
TO DEFEAT UNALAQ.

248
00:11:39,041 --> 00:11:40,166
- IT'S TRUE.

249
00:11:40,208 --> 00:11:41,959
IF YOU CAN'T MAKE MONEY
DURING A WAR,

250
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,041
YOU JUST FLAT-OUT
CANNOT MAKE MONEY.

251
00:11:44,083 --> 00:11:46,333
- IT'S DANGEROUS
ON THE SEAS RIGHT NOW,

252
00:11:46,375 --> 00:11:48,375
BUT I'M WILLING
TO TRY IF YOU ARE.

253
00:11:48,417 --> 00:11:51,208
- IT'LL BE CRAZY RISKY,

254
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:53,333
BUT I LOVE CRAZY RISKY!

255
00:11:53,375 --> 00:11:55,000
END STORM!

256
00:11:59,834 --> 00:12:02,834
ZHU LI, GET THOSE OTHER IDEAS
TO RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT.

257
00:12:02,875 --> 00:12:04,917
I WANT PROTOTYPES
BY NEXT WEEK.

258
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:07,500
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHY IT'S SO HARD

259
00:12:07,542 --> 00:12:09,375
TO GET REPUBLIC CITY
TO SUPPORT THE SOUTH.

260
00:12:09,417 --> 00:12:12,041
- DON'T WORRY.
I'M ALREADY WORKING ON THAT.

261
00:12:12,083 --> 00:12:13,917
AS SOON AS PEOPLE SEE THIS,

262
00:12:13,959 --> 00:12:16,458
THEY'LL BE LINING UP
TO FIGHT UNALAQ.

263
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:20,083
ZHU LI, DO THE, UH--
THE THING.

264
00:12:20,125 --> 00:12:22,041
- DON'T FREAK OUT.
IT'S NOT REAL.

265
00:12:22,083 --> 00:12:25,667
- I HAD A FILM CREW DOCUMENTING
THE ENTIRE NORTHERN INVASION.

- [screams]
[Pabu squeaks]

267
00:12:31,291 --> 00:12:32,959
SORRY.
I KEEP DOING THAT.

268
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,542
- WE'RE GONNA CUT

OH, MAN, YOU SHOULD
HAVE SEEN VARRICK TODAY.

THAT GUY IS A GENIUS.
- UH-HUH.

279
00:13:02,041 --> 00:13:04,166
- HE'S GONNA HELP ASAMI SELL
HER MECHA-TANKS TO THE SOUTH,

280
00:13:04,208 --> 00:13:06,500
AND HE CAME UP
WITH THIS GREAT IDEA FOR KORRA

281
00:13:06,542 --> 00:13:08,792
TO GET GENERAL IROH
TO FIGHT UNALAQ

282
00:13:08,834 --> 00:13:11,834
WITHOUT PRESIDENT RAIKO
EVER EVEN KNOWING.

283

- AND HE'S GONNA
PUT ME IN THE MOVERS

285
00:13:14,458 --> 00:13:16,500
AS THIS HERO, NUKTUK.

286
00:13:16,542 --> 00:13:19,458
HE'S A MAN OF ACTION,
BUT HE'S GOT A HEART OF GOLD.

287
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,333
HE WAS BORN IN THE TUNDRA.

288
00:13:21,375 --> 00:13:22,667

TO DO SOMETHING

289
00:13:22,709 --> 00:13:23,458
THAT'S ACTUALLY IMPORTANT HERE.

I JUST DON'T BUY
THAT THE NORTHERN WATER TRIBE

294

THE FIRST THING
YOU NEED TO DO AS A TRAINER

00:13:50,291 --> 00:13:52,083
IS ESTABLISH DOMINANCE.

304
00:13:52,125 --> 00:13:54,875
YOU ARE IN CHARGE.
NEVER FORGET THAT.

305
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:56,458

- BUT HE'S TICKLING ME.

00:14:20,458 --> 00:14:22,875
YOU ARE THE ALPHA LEMUR.
