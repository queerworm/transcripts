1
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:09,197
Earth.

2
00:00:09,198 --> 00:00:10,732
Fire.

3
00:00:10,733 --> 00:00:12,768
Air.

4
00:00:12,769 --> 00:00:15,237
Water.

5
00:00:15,238 --> 00:00:18,840
Only the Avatar
can master all four elements

6
00:00:18,841 --> 00:00:23,841
and bring balance
to the world.

7
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:30,519
It's brother versus brother
in the War of the Water Tribes.

8
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:31,787
After Korra discovered

9
00:00:31,788 --> 00:00:33,922
that Chief Unalaq betrayed her
and her father,

10
00:00:33,923 --> 00:00:36,792
she turned against him,
sparking civil war.

11
00:00:36,793 --> 00:00:38,927
The Southern rebels
rallied around Tonraq,

12
00:00:38,928 --> 00:00:40,529
but they are vastly outnumbered.

13
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:43,198
So Korra is headed
to Republic City to seek aid.

14
00:00:43,199 --> 00:00:45,267
But will she be able
to convince President Raiko

15
00:00:45,268 --> 00:00:50,268
to send troops to help the South?

16
00:01:03,219 --> 00:01:06,354
- Welcome home, Avatar.
Thanks for starting a war.

17
00:01:06,355 --> 00:01:08,690
- I didn't start a war.

18
00:01:08,691 --> 00:01:11,526
Well, I did,
but it's more complicated

19
00:01:11,527 --> 00:01:12,728
than you're making it seem.

20
00:01:12,729 --> 00:01:14,663
- Mako, I want you back on the beat.

21
00:01:14,664 --> 00:01:17,532
There's going to be a Southern
Water Tribe peace march tonight.

22
00:01:17,533 --> 00:01:19,901
I need you there to make sure
things don't get out of hand.

23
00:01:19,902 --> 00:01:21,369
- I'm all yours.

24
00:01:21,370 --> 00:01:22,671
- I'll go too.

25
00:01:22,672 --> 00:01:24,306
The people
of the South need to see

26
00:01:24,307 --> 00:01:25,674
that the Avatar
is on their side

27
00:01:25,675 --> 00:01:27,609
in the fight
against the Northern invaders.

28
00:01:27,610 --> 00:01:30,746
- Great.
That should calm them down.

29
00:01:30,747 --> 00:01:32,914
- Maybe you should sit this out.
- What?

30
00:01:32,915 --> 00:01:35,484
- I just think having you there
blatantly supporting one side

31
00:01:35,485 --> 00:01:36,651
will only make things worse.

32
00:01:36,652 --> 00:01:38,587
You could at least try to seem neutral.

33
00:01:38,588 --> 00:01:41,523
- I'm not neutral.
The North invaded my home.

34
00:01:41,524 --> 00:01:42,858
The only reason I'm here

35
00:01:42,859 --> 00:01:45,560
is to get the Republic to
send troops to help the South.

36
00:01:45,561 --> 00:01:47,329
- Zhu Li's already scheduled
a meeting for us

37
00:01:47,330 --> 00:01:48,663
with President Raiko tomorrow.

38
00:01:48,664 --> 00:01:50,298
We'll get him on board.

39
00:01:50,299 --> 00:01:52,300
- Whatever.
I gotta go to work.

40
00:01:52,301 --> 00:01:53,668
- I better go check on my factory.

41
00:01:53,669 --> 00:01:55,537
- I'm going to find out
about this peace march.

42
00:01:55,538 --> 00:02:00,538
- And I am dying for a pedicure!

43
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:04,179
- So, uh, what should I be doing?

44
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:05,614
- I don't know, Bolin.

45
00:02:05,615 --> 00:02:09,785
Figure something out.

46
00:02:09,786 --> 00:02:12,554
- Say, kid, have you ever seen
Republic City at night?

47
00:02:12,555 --> 00:02:14,322
- Sure, I live here.

48
00:02:14,323 --> 00:02:16,258
- Have you really seen it?

49
00:02:16,259 --> 00:02:17,692
- Y--no?

50
00:02:17,693 --> 00:02:20,462
That's what I thought.

51
00:02:20,463 --> 00:02:23,298
Come on.

52
00:02:23,299 --> 00:02:25,467
- Tonraq and the rebels
are holed up here

53
00:02:25,468 --> 00:02:27,435
in the hills outside of town.

54
00:02:27,436 --> 00:02:28,603
- Leave them.

55
00:02:28,604 --> 00:02:30,338
My brother's no threat to us up there.

56
00:02:30,339 --> 00:02:32,607
Increase security
around the spirit portal.

57
00:02:32,608 --> 00:02:35,243
Keeping it safe
is our number one priority.

58
00:02:35,244 --> 00:02:40,244
- Yes, sir.

59
00:02:46,622 --> 00:02:49,357
- I need you two to go after the Avatar.

60
00:02:49,358 --> 00:02:52,394
She's the only one who can open
the northern spirit portal.

61
00:02:52,395 --> 00:02:54,696
- But, Father, you told Korra--

62
00:02:54,697 --> 00:02:57,532
- I told Korra what I thought
she needed to hear.

63
00:02:57,533 --> 00:03:00,802
- I'll find her.
She stole my husband.

64
00:03:00,803 --> 00:03:03,238
- I need her alive.

65
00:03:03,239 --> 00:03:08,239
Fine.

66
00:03:09,512 --> 00:03:12,614
- Watch me, Poki.

67
00:03:12,615 --> 00:03:15,684
You lay down and roll over.

68
00:03:15,685 --> 00:03:18,253
Roll over.

69
00:03:18,254 --> 00:03:20,755
- No, no, you can't just demonstrate it.

70
00:03:20,756 --> 00:03:21,923
That never works.

71
00:03:25,261 --> 00:03:28,196
- Good.

72
00:03:29,465 --> 00:03:31,499
- Ugh, classic over-rewarding.

73
00:03:34,637 --> 00:03:36,471
- Poki, where are you going?

74
00:03:36,472 --> 00:03:38,340
- Command respect.

75
00:03:41,744 --> 00:03:42,878
Having some trouble, son?

76
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:45,247
- Poki isn't very good at learning.

77
00:03:45,248 --> 00:03:47,682
- Believe me,
I know the feeling.

78
00:03:47,683 --> 00:03:49,317
Maybe I can help.

79
00:03:49,318 --> 00:03:50,652
How would you like your old dad

80
00:03:50,653 --> 00:03:52,520
to teach you
how to be a master trainer?

81
00:03:52,521 --> 00:03:54,656
- Yeah!

82
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:09,204
Tensions are running high

83
00:04:09,205 --> 00:04:11,773
outside of the Southern Water
Tribe Cultural Center.

84
00:04:11,774 --> 00:04:13,875
The Avatar is leading
a group of Southerners

85
00:04:13,876 --> 00:04:16,878
in a peaceful protest
against Chief Unalaq,

86
00:04:16,879 --> 00:04:19,214
but the Northerners
have come out in droves

87
00:04:19,215 --> 00:04:20,882
in support of their leader.

88
00:04:20,883 --> 00:04:22,617
- Boo!

89
00:04:22,618 --> 00:04:24,619
- Get out of here!

90
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:28,156
- Boo!
- Get a real job!

91
00:04:28,157 --> 00:04:33,157
- Get out of here!
- You stink!

92
00:04:44,507 --> 00:04:45,407
- Hey!

93
00:04:45,408 --> 00:04:46,441
Stop!

94
00:04:46,442 --> 00:04:49,344
Republic City Police.

95
00:05:39,662 --> 00:05:42,230
- The Northern Water Tribe
is out of control.

96
00:05:42,231 --> 00:05:45,300
- I saw a firebender
running away from the blast.

97
00:05:45,301 --> 00:05:47,369
The North might not be
responsible for this.

98
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:48,770
- Of course they're responsible.

99
00:05:48,771 --> 00:05:53,771
Who else would it be?

100
00:06:07,323 --> 00:06:08,790
- Wow.

101
00:06:08,791 --> 00:06:11,426
Usually, when I see
flashing lights like this,

102
00:06:11,427 --> 00:06:13,728
it's because I got hit
in the head with a rock.

103
00:06:13,729 --> 00:06:16,197
- Being famous is like
getting hit with a rock

104
00:06:16,198 --> 00:06:21,198
all the time.

105
00:06:21,837 --> 00:06:24,539
- Look!
It's Bolin!

106
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:27,842
Bolin! Bolin! Bolin!

107
00:06:27,843 --> 00:06:32,147
Bolin! Bolin!
Bolin! Bolin!

108
00:06:32,148 --> 00:06:33,448
- Folks,
that cheer you're hearing

109
00:06:33,449 --> 00:06:35,717
is for local favorite, Bolin,
of the Fire Ferrets.

110
00:06:35,718 --> 00:06:37,886
Let's see
if we can get a quick interview.

111
00:06:37,887 --> 00:06:40,355
Bolin!

112
00:06:40,356 --> 00:06:42,557
Bolin, the Fire Ferrets
are out for the season.

113
00:06:42,558 --> 00:06:44,492
How have you been spending
your time lately?

114
00:06:44,493 --> 00:06:47,695
- Well, I took a trip south
for the Glacier Spirits Festival,

115
00:06:47,696 --> 00:06:49,631
was briefly engaged
to a princess,

116
00:06:49,632 --> 00:06:52,500
then went through kind of
a tough breakup there,

117
00:06:52,501 --> 00:06:56,905
was accidentally involved
in a civil war...

118
00:06:58,274 --> 00:07:00,375
- But there's nowhere I'd rather be

119
00:07:00,376 --> 00:07:02,444
than Pro Bending Night
in Republic City!

120
00:07:02,445 --> 00:07:03,678
Am I right, people?

121
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:05,847
Republic City!

122
00:07:08,451 --> 00:07:10,785
- Do you miss being in the ring?

123
00:07:10,786 --> 00:07:12,220
- Well, I definitely don't miss

124
00:07:12,221 --> 00:07:13,521
getting hit with things all the time

125
00:07:13,522 --> 00:07:15,390
and the humiliating losing.

126
00:07:15,391 --> 00:07:16,658
I mean, that gets pretty old.

127
00:07:16,659 --> 00:07:19,627
You know, sometimes I actually
cry myself to sleep...

128
00:07:21,497 --> 00:07:24,766
- I guess what I miss the most
are these fans!

129
00:07:24,767 --> 00:07:26,701
They're the greatest fans in the world!

130
00:07:26,702 --> 00:07:31,239
Give it up for the fans!

131
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:33,842
- Look how
these people love you, kid.

132
00:07:33,843 --> 00:07:36,444
They're eating that cornball spiel
right out of your hand.

133
00:07:36,445 --> 00:07:38,880
- The trick is,
whenever I get confused,

134
00:07:38,881 --> 00:07:41,716
I just say "Republic City" or "fans,"

135
00:07:41,717 --> 00:07:43,384
and then everyone cheers.

136
00:07:43,385 --> 00:07:48,385
- I think I just figured out
your true calling.

137
00:07:49,925 --> 00:07:52,160
- I hope President Raiko
listens to us.

138
00:07:52,161 --> 00:07:53,528
- Don't worry.

139
00:07:53,529 --> 00:07:56,631
I was a big contributor
to his election campaign.

140
00:07:56,632 --> 00:08:01,632
Him and the other guy.
Gotta hedge your bets.

141
00:08:02,505 --> 00:08:05,807
- Hello, Mr. President.

142
00:08:05,808 --> 00:08:08,243
Sir, the Southern Water Tribe--

143
00:08:08,244 --> 00:08:09,477
- Just a second.

144
00:08:09,478 --> 00:08:12,780
Keep smiling.

145
00:08:12,781 --> 00:08:15,116
- Eh...

146
00:08:15,117 --> 00:08:19,154
- Now, how can I help the Avatar
and my most generous supporter?

147
00:08:19,155 --> 00:08:21,556
- Unalaq's troops
have invaded the South.

148
00:08:21,557 --> 00:08:23,858
We need you to send
the United Forces to help.

149
00:08:23,859 --> 00:08:26,661
- I'm very concerned
by what's happening down there,

150
00:08:26,662 --> 00:08:28,530
but I don't think
it's the Republic's place

151
00:08:28,531 --> 00:08:30,498
to interfere
with internal Water Tribe matters.

152
00:08:30,499 --> 00:08:33,601
- Unalaq isn't even the rightful
ruler of the Water Tribe.

153
00:08:33,602 --> 00:08:36,204
He lied his way
onto the Northern throne.

154
00:08:36,205 --> 00:08:37,438
- Mr. President,

155
00:08:37,439 --> 00:08:39,741
the Republic is already
involved in this conflict.

156
00:08:39,742 --> 00:08:42,277
The North attacked
our cultural center last night.

157
00:08:42,278 --> 00:08:44,746
- Believe me,
we are doing everything we can

158
00:08:44,747 --> 00:08:46,915
to bring the people responsible
to justice.

159
00:08:46,916 --> 00:08:48,616
- "The people responsible"?

160
00:08:48,617 --> 00:08:50,752
Who else would it be
but the Northerners?

161
00:08:50,753 --> 00:08:52,420
- Now, I know
that when you're young,

162
00:08:52,421 --> 00:08:53,855
it's hard to keep perspective--

163
00:08:53,856 --> 00:08:56,224
- You're the one who's lost perspective.

164
00:08:56,225 --> 00:08:58,793
I'm trying to save my tribe,
and you're taking pictures.

165
00:08:58,794 --> 00:09:01,863
- Sending troops is not
something I can do at this time,

166
00:09:01,864 --> 00:09:04,432
but I promise I will work
with Unalaq and the South

167
00:09:04,433 --> 00:09:06,134
for a diplomatic solution.

168
00:09:06,135 --> 00:09:08,570
Now, I'm sorry,
but my mind is made up.

169
00:09:08,571 --> 00:09:09,871
This meeting is over.

170
00:09:09,872 --> 00:09:12,774
- My family is going to be wiped out,

171
00:09:12,775 --> 00:09:17,775
and it'll be on your head
for doing nothing about it.

172
00:09:22,818 --> 00:09:24,719
- I can't believe
the President is doing nothing.

173
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,321
He-- he doesn't even care.

174
00:09:26,322 --> 00:09:28,556
- I'm sure he cares,
but he can't just tell his people

175
00:09:28,557 --> 00:09:29,891
to go fight a battle at the South Pole

176
00:09:29,892 --> 00:09:31,259
that has nothing to do with them.

177
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:32,860
- How could you take his side?

178
00:09:32,861 --> 00:09:34,629
- What's with you and sides?

179
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:36,598
Why do you always think
I'm working against you?

180
00:09:36,599 --> 00:09:38,600
- Well, you're not helping me.

181
00:09:38,601 --> 00:09:39,901
I'm trying to get troops to the South.

182
00:09:39,902 --> 00:09:41,336
What are you doing?

183
00:09:41,337 --> 00:09:43,171
- I'm doing my job.

184
00:09:43,172 --> 00:09:45,607
Well, excuse me, Officer.

185
00:09:45,608 --> 00:09:48,276
Don't let me stand in the way
of you writing tickets.

186
00:09:48,277 --> 00:09:49,844
I'm just trying to save the world.

187
00:09:49,845 --> 00:09:52,247
- Well, you wouldn't have to
if you didn't keep messing it up.

188
00:09:52,248 --> 00:09:53,881
- I can't talk to you
when you're like this.

189
00:09:57,219 --> 00:10:00,989
You're the one who's like this!

190
00:10:04,526 --> 00:10:06,194
Hey, in a hurry?

191
00:10:06,195 --> 00:10:07,629
- Sorry, I have to talk to Varrick.

192
00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:12,300
- Yeah, me too.

193
00:10:16,805 --> 00:10:18,306
- Oh, hello.

194
00:10:18,307 --> 00:10:19,907
See?
I told you I could do it.

195
00:10:19,908 --> 00:10:22,277
- Sorry I ever doubted you.

196
00:10:22,278 --> 00:10:24,245
- We can't wait
for the President to act.

197
00:10:24,246 --> 00:10:25,713
We need those troops now.

198
00:10:25,714 --> 00:10:27,582
- And my company is about to go under.

199
00:10:27,583 --> 00:10:29,517
I have to find a way to make some sales.

200
00:10:29,518 --> 00:10:31,419
- Right. Okay.
Got it.

201
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:32,854
Idea storm.

202
00:10:32,855 --> 00:10:35,290
Get the supplies.

203
00:10:35,291 --> 00:10:36,924
You're about to get an inside look

204
00:10:36,925 --> 00:10:38,926
at how Varrick Global Industries

205
00:10:38,927 --> 00:10:42,196
stays at the forefront
of imagination innovation

206
00:10:42,197 --> 00:10:44,699
or "imagivation"!

207
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:48,803
That's trademarked, pal.

208
00:10:48,804 --> 00:10:53,804
Brain work requires
increased circulation.

209
00:10:54,877 --> 00:10:59,447
Let's do this!

210
00:10:59,448 --> 00:11:03,351
Okay, here come the ideas,
fast and furious.

211
00:11:03,352 --> 00:11:06,621
Pink mint lemon tea.

212
00:11:06,622 --> 00:11:09,557
Radio for pets.

213
00:11:09,558 --> 00:11:12,460
Uh, hand shoes.

214
00:11:12,461 --> 00:11:13,761
Hold on a tic.

215
00:11:13,762 --> 00:11:16,364
We don't need the President
to go to the South.

216
00:11:16,365 --> 00:11:19,400
We just need the troops.
Let's go straight to them.

217
00:11:19,401 --> 00:11:21,369
If there's one thing
I know about troops,

218
00:11:21,370 --> 00:11:23,237
it's that they love fighting.

219
00:11:23,238 --> 00:11:25,740
- I know General lroh.
He might be willing to help us.

220
00:11:25,741 --> 00:11:28,409
- A man on the inside.
Perfect.

221
00:11:28,410 --> 00:11:30,712
And you need to sell
some mecha-tanks.

222
00:11:30,713 --> 00:11:32,914
I know some people who need them.

223
00:11:32,915 --> 00:11:34,615
We'll ship 'em South.

224
00:11:34,616 --> 00:11:35,783
- That's perfect.

225
00:11:35,784 --> 00:11:37,385
You'll be making money
for your company,

226
00:11:37,386 --> 00:11:39,220
and you'll be helping
to defeat Unalaq.

227
00:11:39,221 --> 00:11:40,288
- It's true.

228
00:11:40,289 --> 00:11:41,923
If you can't make money
during a war,

229
00:11:41,924 --> 00:11:43,958
you just flat-out
cannot make money.

230
00:11:43,959 --> 00:11:46,527
- It's dangerous
on the seas right now,

231
00:11:46,528 --> 00:11:48,696
but I'm willing to try if you are.

232
00:11:48,697 --> 00:11:51,432
- It'll be crazy risky,

233
00:11:51,433 --> 00:11:53,668
but I love crazy risky!

234
00:11:53,669 --> 00:11:58,669
End storm!

235
00:11:59,808 --> 00:12:03,144
Zhu Li, get those other ideas
to research and development.

236
00:12:03,145 --> 00:12:05,213
I want prototypes by next week.

237
00:12:05,214 --> 00:12:07,582
- I don't understand why it's so hard

238
00:12:07,583 --> 00:12:09,484
to get Republic City
to support the South.

239
00:12:09,485 --> 00:12:12,253
- Don't worry.
I'm already working on that.

240
00:12:12,254 --> 00:12:14,222
As soon as people see this,

241
00:12:14,223 --> 00:12:16,557
they'll be lining up to fight Unalaq.

242
00:12:16,558 --> 00:12:20,695
Zhu Li, do the, uh-- the thing.

243
00:12:20,696 --> 00:12:21,929
- Don't freak out.
It's not real.

244
00:12:21,930 --> 00:12:26,930
- I had a film crew documenting
the entire Northern invasion.

245
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,907
Sorry.
I keep doing that.

246
00:12:32,908 --> 00:12:34,642
- We're gonna cut
this footage together

247
00:12:34,643 --> 00:12:37,378
with scenes we shoot
of our superstar Bolin here

248
00:12:37,379 --> 00:12:39,747
playing a Southern Water Tribe hero

249
00:12:39,748 --> 00:12:41,549
battling the evil Unalaq.

250
00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:43,785
No one will root
for the North after they see

251
00:12:43,786 --> 00:12:48,786
"The Adventures of Nuktuk:
Hero of the South!"

252
00:12:49,258 --> 00:12:52,894
- I'm Nuktuk!
What do you think?

253
00:12:57,199 --> 00:12:59,534
Oh, man, you should
have seen Varrick today.

254
00:12:59,535 --> 00:13:01,869
That guy is a genius.
- Uh-huh.

255
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:04,338
- He's gonna help Asami sell
her mecha-tanks to the South,

256
00:13:04,339 --> 00:13:06,541
and he came up
with this great idea for Korra

257
00:13:06,542 --> 00:13:08,743
to get General lroh to fight Unalaq

258
00:13:08,744 --> 00:13:11,479
without President Raiko
ever even knowing.

259
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:13,214
- What?
That's a terrible idea.

260
00:13:13,215 --> 00:13:14,649
- And he's gonna
put me in the movers

261
00:13:14,650 --> 00:13:16,384
as this hero, Nuktuk.

262
00:13:16,385 --> 00:13:19,520
He's a man of action,
but he's got a heart of gold.

263
00:13:19,521 --> 00:13:21,456
He was born in the tundra.

264
00:13:21,457 --> 00:13:22,657
- Look, I'm trying to do something

265
00:13:22,658 --> 00:13:23,691
that's actually important here.

266
00:13:23,692 --> 00:13:26,227
- Oh.
Oh, sorry.

267
00:13:26,228 --> 00:13:27,895
Uh, sure.
What is it?

268
00:13:27,896 --> 00:13:30,765
- Something doesn't make sense
about this bombing.

269
00:13:30,766 --> 00:13:32,567
I just don't buy
that the Northern Water Tribe

270
00:13:32,568 --> 00:13:34,435
was behind it.

271
00:13:34,436 --> 00:13:36,704
Wait a second!
That's him!

272
00:13:36,705 --> 00:13:38,840
That's the guy
that attacked the center.

273
00:13:38,841 --> 00:13:40,741
I gotta go show this to Beifong.

274
00:13:40,742 --> 00:13:42,510
- Glad I could help.

275
00:13:42,511 --> 00:13:45,313
Nuktuk saves the day again!

276
00:13:47,182 --> 00:13:48,349
- All right, Meelo.

277
00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:50,384
The first thing
you need to do as a trainer

278
00:13:50,385 --> 00:13:52,286
is establish dominance.

279
00:13:52,287 --> 00:13:54,956
You are in charge.
Never forget that.

280
00:13:54,957 --> 00:13:56,524
Now call Poki.

281
00:13:56,525 --> 00:13:59,193
- Poki, come here.

282
00:14:00,596 --> 00:14:01,729
Poki.

283
00:14:03,532 --> 00:14:05,800
Poki, no.
- Meelo.

284
00:14:05,801 --> 00:14:08,736
You're rewarding him for bad behavior.

285
00:14:08,737 --> 00:14:13,737
- But he's tickling me.

286
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:20,615
- You can't let him
nap in the bed with you.

287
00:14:20,616 --> 00:14:22,750
You are the alpha lemur.

288
00:14:22,751 --> 00:14:24,218
He has to sleep on the floor.

289
00:14:28,490 --> 00:14:31,559
I know it's hard,
but it's for the best.

290
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:34,395
- No, Poki.
This is my bed.

291
00:14:34,396 --> 00:14:36,564
You sleep on the floor.

292
00:14:40,736 --> 00:14:45,736
Being alpha lemur is lonely.

293
00:14:47,309 --> 00:14:51,546
- I know.

294
00:14:51,547 --> 00:14:52,947
- How did this cultural center
attack happen

295
00:14:52,948 --> 00:14:54,515
right under your nose?

296
00:14:54,516 --> 00:14:57,652
And why haven't you arrested
the Northerners responsible?

297
00:14:57,653 --> 00:15:00,254
- We're working on it, sir.
- Well, work harder.

298
00:15:00,255 --> 00:15:01,322
If you don't get any results soon,

299
00:15:01,323 --> 00:15:03,724
I'm going to find someone who can.

300
00:15:03,725 --> 00:15:05,393
- I got a break
in the bombing case.

301
00:15:05,394 --> 00:15:07,728
I ID'd the guy I saw at the scene.

302
00:15:07,729 --> 00:15:09,463
- That's great, Mako.

303
00:15:09,464 --> 00:15:12,366
- Yeah, you better run that in
to Beifong right now.

304
00:15:12,367 --> 00:15:13,467
- You think?

305
00:15:13,468 --> 00:15:18,468
- Sure.
You're gonna be a hero.

306
00:15:21,243 --> 00:15:22,910
- What makes a rookie beat cop

307
00:15:22,911 --> 00:15:25,813
think he can interrupt
my meeting with the President?

308
00:15:25,814 --> 00:15:27,281
- I'm sorry.

309
00:15:27,282 --> 00:15:29,717
I just--um, I found
something out about the bombing.

310
00:15:29,718 --> 00:15:31,719
- Well, give it to Lu and Gang,
you moron.

311
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:33,888
Now get out!

312
00:15:33,889 --> 00:15:36,223
- Sorry.
Was she busy?

313
00:15:36,224 --> 00:15:37,558
- This is the guy I saw

314
00:15:37,559 --> 00:15:39,660
sneaking out of the building
right before the explosions.

315
00:15:39,661 --> 00:15:41,896
He's a member
of the Agni Kais.

316
00:15:41,897 --> 00:15:43,731
Someone must have hired him
to make it look

317
00:15:43,732 --> 00:15:46,834
like Northerners attacked
the cultural center.

318
00:15:46,835 --> 00:15:50,771
- Hmm.

319
00:15:50,772 --> 00:15:53,207
- Did you learn anything
about that remote control

320
00:15:53,208 --> 00:15:54,342
I found at the scene?

321
00:15:54,343 --> 00:15:55,509
That's gotta be the key

322
00:15:55,510 --> 00:15:56,844
to finding out
who's really responsible.

323
00:15:56,845 --> 00:15:59,647
- Listen, kid, it was
the Northern Water Tribe, okay?

324
00:15:59,648 --> 00:16:04,352
- Yeah, give it a rest, super cop.

325
00:16:10,158 --> 00:16:12,460
- I've heard good things
about you.

326
00:16:12,461 --> 00:16:14,729
You've made some big triad busts
for a rookie.

327
00:16:14,730 --> 00:16:15,863
- Thank you, sir.

328
00:16:15,864 --> 00:16:17,565
- And you're dating the Avatar, right?

329
00:16:17,566 --> 00:16:18,733
- Yes, sir.

330
00:16:18,734 --> 00:16:20,635
- I'm concerned
that she might be getting

331
00:16:20,636 --> 00:16:23,771
some bad advice from Varrick.

332
00:16:23,772 --> 00:16:26,240
You wouldn't happen to know
if they're plotting anything

333
00:16:26,241 --> 00:16:29,176
that might compromise
the security of Republic City,

334
00:16:29,177 --> 00:16:32,513
would you, Officer?

335
00:16:32,514 --> 00:16:35,349
Let me remind you
that you've sworn an oath.

336
00:16:35,350 --> 00:16:37,218
You're a man of the law
before anything else.

337
00:16:37,219 --> 00:16:38,786
- Yes, sir.

338
00:16:38,787 --> 00:16:43,787
- Well, keep up the good work.

339
00:16:46,261 --> 00:16:47,828
Wait.

340
00:16:47,829 --> 00:16:52,829
There's something
you should know.

341
00:16:55,737 --> 00:16:57,371
- Thank you for seeing me,
General lroh.

342
00:16:57,372 --> 00:16:58,639
- What can I do?

343
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:00,675
- The South needs military support

344
00:17:00,676 --> 00:17:02,777
before Unalaq
wipes them out completely,

345
00:17:02,778 --> 00:17:05,579
but the President is refusing
to give the order.

346
00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:07,381
So I decided
to come to you directly.

347
00:17:07,382 --> 00:17:08,883
- I see.

348
00:17:08,884 --> 00:17:11,619
Well, suppose I were
to take the fleet south

349
00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:13,888
on some routine training maneuvers.

350
00:17:13,889 --> 00:17:16,257
And let's say we were
to accidentally run

351
00:17:16,258 --> 00:17:18,192
into a hostile Northern blockade.

352
00:17:18,193 --> 00:17:20,861
We'd have no choice
but to defend ourselves, wouldn't we?

353
00:17:20,862 --> 00:17:23,597
- I guess you wouldn't.
Thank you.

354
00:17:23,598 --> 00:17:25,633
- Swapping old war stories?

355
00:17:25,634 --> 00:17:27,234
- Mr. President.

356
00:17:27,235 --> 00:17:29,336
- I hope you're not planning
to take any military action

357
00:17:29,337 --> 00:17:31,605
without an order
from your Commander in Chief.

358
00:17:31,606 --> 00:17:32,740
- Of course not, sir.

359
00:17:32,741 --> 00:17:35,176
- Good, because if a single vessel

360
00:17:35,177 --> 00:17:36,844
leaves this harbor without my say-so,

361
00:17:36,845 --> 00:17:39,346
you'll be court-martialed.
Am I clear?

362
00:17:39,347 --> 00:17:40,881
- Crystal, sir.

363
00:17:40,882 --> 00:17:43,617
- Your activities here
are bordering on insurrection.

364
00:17:43,618 --> 00:17:46,620
The Avatar does not command
the military of the Republic.

365
00:17:46,621 --> 00:17:48,689
Don't go behind my back again.

366
00:17:48,690 --> 00:17:53,690
As you were, General lroh.

367
00:17:54,463 --> 00:17:56,363
- I hate that guy!

368
00:17:56,364 --> 00:17:58,899
- I'm sorry.
My hands are officially tied.

369
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:00,901
- I understand.

370
00:18:00,902 --> 00:18:02,303
Thanks anyway.

371
00:18:02,304 --> 00:18:04,638
- But you should talk to the Fire Lord.

372
00:18:04,639 --> 00:18:07,241
My mother and grandfather
have always been good friends

373
00:18:07,242 --> 00:18:09,677
to the Avatar
and the Southern Water Tribe.

374
00:18:09,678 --> 00:18:12,046
I'm sure they'll be willing to help.

375
00:18:12,047 --> 00:18:13,247
- Thank you, General.

376
00:18:16,685 --> 00:18:19,253
- Wouldn't I be cold
wearing this outfit in the snow?

377
00:18:19,254 --> 00:18:21,355
- Ah, Nuktuk is never cold.

378
00:18:21,356 --> 00:18:23,491
- Ooh.

379
00:18:23,492 --> 00:18:27,428
Hey, Ginger.

380
00:18:27,429 --> 00:18:28,829
- How about that, huh?

381
00:18:28,830 --> 00:18:31,599
It's the latest product in
my Varri-Manageable hair line:

382
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:32,767
Varri-dye!

383
00:18:32,768 --> 00:18:34,301
We get some shots
of her using it

384
00:18:34,302 --> 00:18:35,770
before Unalaq kidnaps her,

385
00:18:35,771 --> 00:18:39,573
I guarantee we sell
a million cases week one.

386
00:18:39,574 --> 00:18:42,209
- Bolin, I need you to watch
Naga while I'm gone.

387
00:18:42,210 --> 00:18:44,145
- Where you going?
- The Fire Nation.

388
00:18:44,146 --> 00:18:45,913
I'm going to try
to get them to help the South.

389
00:18:45,914 --> 00:18:47,181
I need a boat.

390
00:18:47,182 --> 00:18:48,749
- What happened
with General lroh?

391
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:51,752
- He was going to help, but then
President Raiko showed up.

392
00:18:51,753 --> 00:18:53,220
Someone must have tipped him off,

393
00:18:53,221 --> 00:18:54,522
but I can't figure it out.

394
00:18:54,523 --> 00:18:56,757
No one knew about it
except for us and Asami.

395
00:18:56,758 --> 00:18:59,226
- And Mako.
- Mako?

396
00:18:59,227 --> 00:19:00,494
- What?

397
00:19:00,495 --> 00:19:03,430
There's no way
Mako would have told.

398
00:19:03,431 --> 00:19:06,267
Right?

399
00:19:08,336 --> 00:19:10,871
- Poki, sit.

400
00:19:10,872 --> 00:19:12,840
Roll over.

401
00:19:12,841 --> 00:19:16,443
Good boy.

402
00:19:16,444 --> 00:19:17,878
- Well done, Meelo.

403
00:19:17,879 --> 00:19:19,880
I knew you could learn to train Poki.

404
00:19:19,881 --> 00:19:21,348
- Not just Poki.

405
00:19:21,349 --> 00:19:23,117
I trained all the lemurs.

406
00:19:23,118 --> 00:19:25,186
Watch.

407
00:19:43,572 --> 00:19:46,140
- I've created a monster.

408
00:19:46,141 --> 00:19:48,442
Uh, maybe we should forget

409
00:19:48,443 --> 00:19:51,145
about all this training
discipline for now.

410
00:19:51,146 --> 00:19:53,747
Why don't you and Poki
just have fun and play?

411
00:19:53,748 --> 00:19:55,249
- Thanks, Dad.

412
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:57,251
Training makes me tired.

413
00:19:57,252 --> 00:20:00,254
Come on, Poki.

414
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:07,661
- You ratted me out to the President?

415
00:20:07,662 --> 00:20:09,196
- Korra, let me explain.

416
00:20:09,197 --> 00:20:11,665
- Explain why my boyfriend
stabbed me in the back?

417
00:20:11,666 --> 00:20:13,701
- Look, the President of the Republic

418
00:20:13,702 --> 00:20:15,302
asked me a direct question.

419
00:20:15,303 --> 00:20:16,503
What was I supposed to do?

420
00:20:16,504 --> 00:20:19,540
- You betrayed me and my family!

421
00:20:21,643 --> 00:20:24,545
- Enough!
Look, I have a job to do.

422
00:20:24,546 --> 00:20:26,480
I can't constantly be worrying
about keeping you

423
00:20:26,481 --> 00:20:27,882
from making another huge mistake.

424
00:20:27,883 --> 00:20:29,783
- Well, I have a job to do too,

425
00:20:29,784 --> 00:20:31,685
only it seems like you're
always standing in the way

426
00:20:31,686 --> 00:20:33,220
of me getting it done!

427
00:20:33,221 --> 00:20:35,756
- Well, I guess if we're both
putting our jobs first,

428
00:20:35,757 --> 00:20:40,757
maybe there's no room
for our relationship!

429
00:20:41,596 --> 00:20:43,530
- So what?

430
00:20:43,531 --> 00:20:46,767
Are you breaking up with me?

431
00:20:46,768 --> 00:20:51,768
- Yeah.
I guess I am.

432
00:20:57,445 --> 00:21:00,414
- What the flamey-o happened here?

433
00:21:00,415 --> 00:21:02,650
- I broke up with the Avatar.

434
00:21:02,651 --> 00:21:04,285
- You got off easy.

435
00:21:04,286 --> 00:21:05,886
You should have seen
Air Temple Island

436
00:21:05,887 --> 00:21:08,555
after Tenzin broke up with me.

437
00:21:24,572 --> 00:21:29,572
- You ruined my wedding!

438
00:21:36,618 --> 00:21:39,586
No one steals my Bolin!
