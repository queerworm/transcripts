1
00:00:07,458 --> 00:00:09,542
- EARTH.

2
00:00:09,583 --> 00:00:11,375
FIRE.

3
00:00:11,417 --> 00:00:13,125
AIR.

4
00:00:13,166 --> 00:00:15,333
WATER.

5
00:00:15,375 --> 00:00:19,125
ONLY THE AVATAR CAN MASTER
ALL FOUR ELEMENTS

6
00:00:19,166 --> 00:00:22,333
AND BRING BALANCE
TO THE WORLD.

7
00:00:27,166 --> 00:00:29,750
- KUVIRA THREATENS
TO TAKE ZAOFU BY FORCE.

8
00:00:29,792 --> 00:00:32,000
AFTER TENSIONS FLARED
BETWEEN SU BEIFONG

9
00:00:32,041 --> 00:00:34,250
AND HER FORMER PROTEGE,
KORRA BROKERED A TRUCE.

10
00:00:34,291 --> 00:00:35,750
BUT IT WAS TOO LATE.

11
00:00:35,792 --> 00:00:37,208
SU AND HER SONS WERE ALREADY
ON THEIR WAY

12
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:38,875
TO PUT AN END TO KUVIRA.

13
00:00:38,917 --> 00:00:40,750
MEANWHILE, BOLIN AND VARRICK
LEARNED OF KUVIRA'S

14
00:00:40,792 --> 00:00:43,458
TRUE TYRANNICAL INTENT
AND DESERTED HER ARMY.

15
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:45,208
BUT THEY WERE CAPTURED
AND BETRAYED BY ZHU LI.

16
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:47,166
NOW THEY'RE BEING HELD
AGAINST THEIR WILL.

17
00:00:57,792 --> 00:01:01,583
- [muffled grunting]

18
00:01:08,041 --> 00:01:09,500
- ARE YOU SURE THIS WILL WORK?

19
00:01:09,542 --> 00:01:12,000
EVEN WITHOUT KUVIRA,
THEY COULD STILL CRUSH US.

20
00:01:12,041 --> 00:01:13,750
- MOST OF THIS ARMY
HAS BEEN FORCED

21
00:01:13,792 --> 00:01:15,458
INTO SERVICE BY KUVIRA.

22
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:18,208
IF WE TAKE HER OUT,
THEY'LL HAVE NO REASON TO FIGHT.

23
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:22,083
TONIGHT WE END
HER REIGN OF TERROR.

24
00:01:40,667 --> 00:01:42,041
[heavy footsteps]

25
00:01:56,542 --> 00:01:58,250
SHE'S ALONE IN THERE.

26
00:01:58,291 --> 00:02:01,917
NOW'S OUR CHANCE.

27
00:02:10,875 --> 00:02:13,583
- DON'T HURT ME!
- ZHU LI?

28
00:02:13,625 --> 00:02:16,917
[alarm blaring]

29
00:02:21,125 --> 00:02:23,458
- I KNEW YOU'D TRY
A SNEAK ATTACK.

30
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:25,875
YOU WERE AFRAID TO STEP UP
AND LEAD THE EARTH KINGDOM

31
00:02:25,917 --> 00:02:28,959
WHEN YOU HAD THE CHANCE,
YOU WERE AFRAID TO JOIN ME

32
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,375
WHEN I BECAME THE LEADER,

33
00:02:30,417 --> 00:02:32,959
AND NOW YOU'RE AFRAID
OF A FAIR FIGHT.

34
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,458
YOU'VE ALWAYS BEEN A COWARD.

35
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:38,917
TAKE THEM.

36
00:02:40,542 --> 00:02:42,125
- KORRA, YOU HAVE TO GO STOP SU

37
00:02:42,166 --> 00:02:44,208
BEFORE SHE DOES
SOMETHING TERRIBLE.

38
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:46,667
- STOP HER?
WE SHOULD BE HELPING HER!

39
00:02:46,709 --> 00:02:50,166
- WE HAVE NO IDEA WHERE
YOUR MOM IS OR WHAT HER PLAN IS.

40
00:02:50,208 --> 00:02:51,959
IF WE GO CHARGING
INTO KUVIRA'S CAMP,

41
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,542
WE COULD GET THEM ALL CAPTURED
OR WORSE.

42
00:02:54,583 --> 00:02:56,458
ALL WE CAN DO NOW IS WAIT.

43
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:57,667
[loudspeaker feedback]

44
00:02:57,709 --> 00:02:59,875
- ATTENTION,
CITIZENS OF ZAOFU.

45
00:02:59,917 --> 00:03:03,750
YOUR LEADER, SU BEIFONG,
ATTEMPTED TO ATTACK ME

46
00:03:03,792 --> 00:03:08,083
TONIGHT WHILE I SLEPT,
IGNORING THE TERMS OF OUR TRUCE.

47
00:03:08,125 --> 00:03:11,458
LUCKILY, I NOW HAVE HER
AND HER ASSAULT TEAM IN CUSTODY.

48
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:13,333
- NO.

49
00:03:13,375 --> 00:03:15,667
- REST ASSURED
THAT I WILL NOT TAKE REVENGE

50
00:03:15,709 --> 00:03:18,291
ON THE PEACEFUL CITIZENS
OF ZAOFU,

51
00:03:18,333 --> 00:03:20,291
AS LONG AS
YOUR REMAINING REPRESENTATIVES

52
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:23,500
MEET ME OUTSIDE THE CITY
AT DAWN TO OFFER

53
00:03:23,542 --> 00:03:27,125
THE FULL AND UNCONDITIONAL
SURRENDER OF YOUR CITY.

54
00:03:27,166 --> 00:03:28,750
THAT IS ALL.

55
00:03:28,792 --> 00:03:31,834
- KORRA, YOU CAN'T LET KUVIRA
GET AWAY WITH THIS.

56
00:03:31,875 --> 00:03:34,000
WE HAVE TO GO BREAK OUT
MOM AND MY BROTHERS.

57
00:03:34,041 --> 00:03:35,583
- YOU SWORE AN OATH
OF NONAGGRESSION

58
00:03:35,625 --> 00:03:37,208
WHEN YOU BECAME AN AIRBENDER.

59
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:39,542
YOU CAN'T JUST ATTACK KUVIRA.

60
00:03:39,583 --> 00:03:40,917
- I DON'T CARE ABOUT THE OATH.

61
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:42,667
I HAVE TO SAVE MY FAMILY.

62
00:03:42,709 --> 00:03:43,959
- NO, JINORA IS RIGHT.

63
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
YOUR MOM ATTACKED THE CAMP.

64
00:03:46,041 --> 00:03:48,625
KUVIRA WAS
JUST DEFENDING HERSELF.

65
00:03:48,667 --> 00:03:50,208
- DEFENDING HERSELF?

66
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:52,000
SHE WAS GOING
TO ATTACK OUR CITY!

67
00:03:52,041 --> 00:03:54,208
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU'RE REFUSING TO FIGHT.

68
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:56,875
- WHY IS THAT LOUDSPEAKER LADY
TALKING

69
00:03:56,917 --> 00:04:00,208
WHEN I'M TRYING TO SLEEP?

70
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:02,250
- KORRA,
WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO?

71
00:04:02,291 --> 00:04:04,083
- JINORA AND I WILL GO
TALK TO KUVIRA AT DAWN,

72
00:04:04,125 --> 00:04:06,458
AND MAYBE WE CAN
WORK SOMETHING OUT.

73
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:09,875
I PROMISE I'LL DO EVERYTHING
I CAN TO KEEP THE PEACE.

74
00:04:09,917 --> 00:04:11,125
- I'LL GO WITH YOU.

75
00:04:11,166 --> 00:04:13,250
- WE'LL GO, TOO.
- NO.

76
00:04:13,291 --> 00:04:15,834
DAD TOLD US TO FIND KORRA,
AND WE FOUND HER.

77
00:04:15,875 --> 00:04:17,709
NOW YOU NEED TO STAY SAFE.

78
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:20,333
- COME ON, LET US HELP.

79
00:04:20,375 --> 00:04:22,375
- I CAN'T RISK ANYONE ELSE
BEING CAPTURED.

80
00:04:22,417 --> 00:04:24,083
YOU CAN STAY
WITH BAATAR AND HUAN

81
00:04:24,125 --> 00:04:25,625
WHILE I WORK THIS OUT
WITH KUVIRA.

82
00:04:25,667 --> 00:04:26,875
MAKE SURE THEY GET BACK
TO TENZIN SAFELY

83
00:04:26,917 --> 00:04:29,208
IF ANYTHING GOES WRONG.

84
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:30,375
- AW, MAN.

85
00:04:30,417 --> 00:04:33,083
WHEN AM I GONNA SEE
SOME ACTION?

86
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:38,500
- COOKIE JAR EMPTY.

87
00:04:38,542 --> 00:04:41,542
NO HOT TOWELS.

88
00:04:41,583 --> 00:04:43,417
WAXY BUILDUP.

89
00:04:43,458 --> 00:04:45,625
ZHU LI!

90
00:04:45,667 --> 00:04:47,834
- [yawns]

91
00:04:47,875 --> 00:04:51,083
- AW, SHE REALLY IS GONE.

92
00:04:54,458 --> 00:04:57,083
- UP AND AT 'EM, VARRICK.
TIME TO GO TO WORK.

93
00:04:57,125 --> 00:04:59,333
WE HAVE ANOTHER LAB
SET UP FOR YOU.

94
00:04:59,375 --> 00:05:01,959
KUVIRA WANTS THE SPIRIT VINE
WEAPON OPERATIONAL

95
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,625
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

96
00:05:03,667 --> 00:05:05,959
- ZHU LI ALWAYS GREETED ME
IN THE MORNING

97
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,458
WITH A--A HOT CUP OF TEA.

98
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,917
- YOU'LL GET YOUR TEA
WHEN YOU START WORKING.

99
00:05:10,959 --> 00:05:11,917
- WELL,
I'M REALLY ONLY PRODUCTIVE

100
00:05:11,959 --> 00:05:13,166
FOR ABOUT 15 MINUTES A DAY,

101
00:05:13,208 --> 00:05:17,750
USUALLY IN THE AFTERNOON
AROUND 3:45.

102
00:05:17,792 --> 00:05:19,500
[grunts]
- YOU'LL WORK NOW.

103
00:05:19,542 --> 00:05:22,208
I WANT YOU TO SHOW ME
HOW THE DEVICE WORKS.

104
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:24,417
- [yawns]
WHAT'S GOING ON?

105
00:05:24,458 --> 00:05:27,125
- GO BACK TO SLEEP.
WE ONLY NEED VARRICK.

106
00:05:27,166 --> 00:05:30,166
YOU'LL NEED YOUR ENERGY WHEN YOU
GET TO THE REEDUCATION CAMP.

107
00:05:30,208 --> 00:05:32,834
- I CAN'T BE EXPECTED
TO WORK WITHOUT AN ASSISTANT.

108
00:05:32,875 --> 00:05:34,834
WITHOUT ZHU LI,
I'M HELPLESS.

109
00:05:34,875 --> 00:05:37,375
- ONE OF THE GUARDS
WILL BE YOUR ASSISTANT.

110
00:05:37,417 --> 00:05:38,583
I'LL BE SUPERVISING.

111
00:05:38,625 --> 00:05:40,250
- WELL, I GUESS HE'LL BE FINE,

112
00:05:40,291 --> 00:05:42,291
AS LONG AS HE DOESN'T
NEED HIS HANDS AFTERWARDS.

113
00:05:42,333 --> 00:05:43,208
[laughs]

114
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:45,250
- WHAT'S HE TALKING ABOUT, SIR?

115
00:05:45,291 --> 00:05:47,125
- THE LAST TIME WE WORKED
WITH THE SPIRIT VINES,

116
00:05:47,166 --> 00:05:49,959
IT CREATED
AN UNCONTROLLABLE BLAST

117
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,417
THAT BURNED THROUGH A WALL
AND COULD STILL BE

118
00:05:51,458 --> 00:05:53,208
BLOWING UP COMETS IN SPACE,
AS FAR AS I KNOW.

119
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:56,959
I WOULDN'T WANT TO ASSIST ME
IF I WERE YOU.

120
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,750
- MAYBE WE SHOULD JUST
LET THE KID HELP HIM OUT.

121
00:05:59,792 --> 00:06:02,542
- FINE.
BOLIN CAN ASSIST.

122
00:06:02,583 --> 00:06:05,291
- WAIT, WHAT? I NEED MY HANDS!
UH, HOLD ON.

123
00:06:05,333 --> 00:06:07,667
CAN WE GET BREAKFAST FIRST?
WHILE WE STILL HAVE HANDS?

124
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:23,041
- RELEASE THEM NOW!

125
00:06:23,083 --> 00:06:26,417
- IF SU AGREES TO BOW TO ME
AND TURN OVER ZAOFU,

126
00:06:26,458 --> 00:06:29,709
SHE AND THE REST OF YOUR FAMILY
WILL NOT BE HARMED.

127
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:32,542
- NEVER!
I'LL NEVER BOW TO YOU!

128
00:06:32,583 --> 00:06:35,083
- THERE MUST BE SOME WAY
FOR US TO RESOLVE THIS.

129
00:06:35,125 --> 00:06:36,917
- I'VE ALREADY LAID OUT
MY TERMS,

130
00:06:36,959 --> 00:06:39,250
AND I THINK
THEY'RE VERY REASONABLE.

131
00:06:39,291 --> 00:06:41,709
AFTER ALL, SU DID TRY
TO TAKE ME OUT

132
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:44,375
DURING
OUR PEACEFUL NEGOTIATIONS.

133
00:06:44,417 --> 00:06:47,583
- YOU CALL BRINGING AN ARMY
TO THREATEN OUR CITY PEACEFUL?

134
00:06:47,625 --> 00:06:49,041
- WHERE'S BOLIN?

135
00:06:49,083 --> 00:06:50,667
I KNOW HE WOULD NEVER
GO ALONG WITH THIS!

136
00:06:50,709 --> 00:06:52,291
- BOLIN IS WITH MY FIANCE,

137
00:06:52,333 --> 00:06:54,458
WORKING ON SOMETHING
VERY IMPORTANT,

138
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:57,834
BUT I ASSURE YOU
HE'S ON BOARD WITH MY PLANS.

139
00:06:57,875 --> 00:07:00,291
YOU TWO HAVE BEEN APART
FOR SOME TIME.

140
00:07:00,333 --> 00:07:03,625
I GUESS YOU DON'T REALIZE
HOW MUCH BOLIN HAS GROWN UP.

141
00:07:03,667 --> 00:07:06,959
NOW TURN OVER ZAOFU.

142
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,083
- I CAN'T JUST LET YOU
TAKE THE CITY.

143
00:07:09,125 --> 00:07:11,792
- AVATAR KORRA,
YOU ARE INTERFERING

144
00:07:11,834 --> 00:07:14,291
WITH INTERNAL EARTH EMPIRE
BUSINESS

145
00:07:14,333 --> 00:07:15,917
AND LETTING
YOUR PERSONAL FEELINGS

146
00:07:15,959 --> 00:07:17,417
GET IN THE WAY OF REASON.

147
00:07:17,458 --> 00:07:21,041
ZAOFU CANNOT
CONTINUE TO RULE ITSELF.

148
00:07:21,083 --> 00:07:22,542
THEY HAVE BEEN HOARDING
THEIR RICHES

149
00:07:22,583 --> 00:07:24,625
AND TECHNOLOGY TOO LONG.

150
00:07:24,667 --> 00:07:27,417
I'M HERE TO DISTRIBUTE
THOSE RESOURCES FAIRLY

151
00:07:27,458 --> 00:07:28,667
THROUGHOUT THE NATION.

152
00:07:28,709 --> 00:07:31,250
THIS IS ABOUT EQUALITY.

153
00:07:31,291 --> 00:07:32,834
- YOU DON'T CARE ABOUT EQUALITY!

154
00:07:32,875 --> 00:07:34,375
THIS IS ABOUT CONTROL!

155
00:07:34,417 --> 00:07:35,458
JUST TAKE HER DOWN.

156
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:36,750
YOU KNOW
IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO.

157
00:07:36,792 --> 00:07:38,166
YOU HAVE TO STOP THIS!

158
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:40,917
- THE ONLY WAY YOU'RE GOING
TO KEEP ME FROM MARCHING

159
00:07:40,959 --> 00:07:43,959
INTO ZAOFU
IS IF YOU PHYSICALLY STOP ME.

160
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,125
NOW WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO?

161
00:07:46,166 --> 00:07:48,709
- IT LOOKS LIKE
YOU'RE NOT GIVING ME A CHOICE.

162
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:50,291
- FINE.

163
00:07:50,333 --> 00:07:52,834
I WANT YOU ALL TO KNOW
THAT I WOULD NEVER

164
00:07:52,875 --> 00:07:54,500
ASK ANY OF YOU TO DO SOMETHING

165
00:07:54,542 --> 00:07:57,083
THAT I'M NOT WILLING
TO DO MYSELF.

166
00:07:57,125 --> 00:07:59,375
SO RATHER THAN RISK YOUR LIVES,

167
00:07:59,417 --> 00:08:02,917
I WILL FIGHT THE AVATAR
ONE-ON-ONE.

168
00:08:02,959 --> 00:08:04,750
KORRA, IF YOU WIN,

169
00:08:04,792 --> 00:08:07,667
THEN YOU CAN DO
WHATEVER YOU WANT WITH ZAOFU.

170
00:08:07,709 --> 00:08:09,083
BUT AFTER I BEAT YOU,

171
00:08:09,125 --> 00:08:12,083
I WANT YOU OUT OF MY BUSINESS
FOR GOOD.

172
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:15,834
I'M THE ONE WHO BROUGHT PEACE
TO THE EARTH EMPIRE, NOT YOU.

173
00:08:15,875 --> 00:08:18,041
YOU'RE NOT RELEVANT HERE
ANYMORE.

174
00:08:18,083 --> 00:08:20,417
- FINE.
YOU WANT TO FIGHT THE AVATAR?

175
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:23,834
THEN LET'S FINISH THIS
RIGHT HERE, RIGHT NOW!

176
00:08:35,667 --> 00:08:37,875
- ARE YOU REALLY READY
TO FIGHT HER?

177
00:08:37,917 --> 00:08:40,083
- JUST STAY BACK
AND LET ME HANDLE THIS.

178
00:08:40,125 --> 00:08:41,333
IT'S BEEN A WHILE,

179
00:08:41,375 --> 00:08:43,500
BUT I GOT
A LOT OF PENT-UP RAGE.

180
00:08:43,542 --> 00:08:46,125
- DON'T MESS AROUND.
KUVIRA IS TOO GOOD.

181
00:08:46,166 --> 00:08:48,917
JUST GO INTO THE AVATAR STATE
AND GET IT OVER WITH.

182
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:52,667
- NO, I'M ONLY GOING
TO USE THAT AS A LAST RESORT.

183
00:08:52,709 --> 00:08:55,333
- BE CAREFUL.

184
00:08:55,375 --> 00:08:57,542
[bones crack]

185
00:08:59,291 --> 00:09:02,000
- USE WHATEVER YOU WANT,
ALL THE ELEMENTS,

186
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:05,166
THE AVATAR STATE,
ANYTHING YOU NEED.

187
00:09:05,208 --> 00:09:07,583
I KNOW YOU'RE A LITTLE RUSTY.

188
00:09:07,625 --> 00:09:10,500
- ENOUGH TALK.

189
00:09:16,291 --> 00:09:19,417
[groaning]

190
00:09:21,333 --> 00:09:24,917
[all cheering]

191
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:26,625
- [laughs]

192
00:09:26,667 --> 00:09:29,667
LOOKS LIKE THE AVATAR
IS A LITTLE OFF HER GAME.

193
00:09:29,709 --> 00:09:33,166
- [grunts]

194
00:09:33,208 --> 00:09:34,834
- DON'T LET HER
GET YOU FRUSTRATED!

195
00:09:34,875 --> 00:09:37,417
SHE WANTS YOU
TO MAKE A MISTAKE!

196
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,417
[grunting]

197
00:10:19,333 --> 00:10:20,667
- BOLIN, DO THE THING.

198
00:10:20,709 --> 00:10:22,458
- WHAT THING?
- THE THING!

199
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:24,750
I NEVER HAD TO TELL ZHU LI
WHAT THING!

200
00:10:24,792 --> 00:10:25,875
- I'M NOT ZHU LI, OKAY?

201
00:10:25,917 --> 00:10:27,333
PRETEND I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING

202
00:10:27,375 --> 00:10:28,959
ABOUT ANYTHING
THAT'S HAPPENING HERE.

203
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,792
ALSO PRETEND I DON'T WANT
TO BUILD A SUPER WEAPON

204
00:10:30,834 --> 00:10:32,917
OR GET MY HANDS BLOWN OFF.

205
00:10:39,667 --> 00:10:41,458
- WALK ME THROUGH
WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

206
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:43,667
I WANT TO KNOW
EVERY DETAIL OF YOUR WORK.

207
00:10:43,709 --> 00:10:45,458
- YOU KNOW, WHEN I STARTED
WORKING WITH THE VINES,

208
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:48,208
THE POINT WAS TO FIND A CLEAN,
UNLIMITED SOURCE OF ENERGY,

209
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:50,709
NOT DEVELOP
SOME SPIRITY DEATH RAY.

210
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:52,709
- CLEAN ENERGY,
SOUNDS GREAT!

211
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:54,834
WHO DOESN'T LIKE THAT STUFF?
LET'S DO THAT INSTEAD.

212
00:10:54,875 --> 00:10:55,959
- QUIET.

213
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,250
YOU'RE HERE TO HELP, NOT TALK.

214
00:10:58,291 --> 00:11:00,542
AND YOU OF ALL PEOPLE
SHOULD REALIZE

215
00:11:00,583 --> 00:11:02,750
THAT ONCE A DISCOVERY IS MADE,

216
00:11:02,792 --> 00:11:04,583
IT IS OUR RESPONSIBILITY
AS SCIENTISTS

217
00:11:04,625 --> 00:11:07,917
TO PURSUE IT AS FAR AS WE CAN,
WHEREVER IT LEADS.

218
00:11:07,959 --> 00:11:09,417
- HOW WOULD YOU KNOW?

219
00:11:09,458 --> 00:11:11,000
YOU COULDN'T DISCOVER
A WOLF-BAT

220
00:11:11,041 --> 00:11:12,959
IF IT WAS BUILDING A NEST
IN YOUR BUTT.

221
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,458
- [laughs]
OOH.

222
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:16,917
- YOU'RE PATHETIC.

223
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:19,375
WOLF-BATS DON'T BUILD NESTS.

224
00:11:19,417 --> 00:11:22,166
- OOH, YOU GOT ME THERE,
DR. SCIENCE.

225
00:11:22,208 --> 00:11:26,291
YOU'LL NEVER KNOW HOW IT FEELS
TO GIVE BIRTH TO GENIUS,

226
00:11:26,333 --> 00:11:29,208
ONLY TO HAVE IT KIDNAPPED
AND RAISED BY FOOLS.

227
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:30,583
- ARE YOU DONE
WITH YOUR RAMBLING,

228
00:11:30,625 --> 00:11:32,291
OR DO THE GUARDS
NEED TO ENCOURAGE YOU

229
00:11:32,333 --> 00:11:33,709
TO CONTINUE YOUR WORK?

230
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:36,333
- OKAY, OKAY, OKAY.

231
00:11:36,375 --> 00:11:38,542
THE LAST TIME WE RAN
THE CURRENT THROUGH THE VINE,

232
00:11:38,583 --> 00:11:40,250
WE COULDN'T CONTROL THE POWER.

233
00:11:40,291 --> 00:11:44,333
SO I'M TRYING SOMETHING NEW
TO SEE IF I CAN DIRECT IT.

234
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,917
- [grunting]

235
00:12:34,041 --> 00:12:36,709
[panting]

236
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:38,208
- COME ON, AVATAR.

237
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:39,417
GET UP.

238
00:12:39,458 --> 00:12:40,875
SHOW ME WHAT YOU'VE GOT.

239
00:12:40,917 --> 00:12:43,500
- WE HAVE TO HELP HER.

240
00:12:43,542 --> 00:12:46,542
- NO.
STAY BACK.

241
00:12:46,583 --> 00:12:48,041
I CAN HANDLE THIS.

242
00:12:51,041 --> 00:12:53,291
- SO I SEE HOW THE CURRENT
INTERACTS WITH THE VINE,

243
00:12:53,333 --> 00:12:55,417
AND HERE IS
A KIND OF DIRECTIONAL TUBE,

244
00:12:55,458 --> 00:12:56,709
BUT THIS BAFFLING
HERE AT THE BASE...

245
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:58,333
- [sniffs]

246
00:12:58,375 --> 00:13:00,250
- IT LOOKS LIKE THAT WOULD
ONLY REDIRECT THE ENERGY

247
00:13:00,291 --> 00:13:02,083
RIGHT BACK WHERE IT CAME FROM.

248
00:13:02,125 --> 00:13:03,834
AND WHAT'S THAT PIECE OF
EQUIPMENT YOU'RE FIDDLING WITH

249
00:13:03,875 --> 00:13:05,709
NOW ON THE POWER SOURCE?

250
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:07,792
- HAND ME
THE SCREW-TURN-THINGY, WOULD YA?

251
00:13:07,834 --> 00:13:09,542
- UGH, I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU'RE HELPING THEM.

252
00:13:09,583 --> 00:13:11,166
YOU KNOW THIS ISN'T RIGHT.

253
00:13:11,208 --> 00:13:12,750
- FUNNY STORY, BOLIN.

254
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:15,291
I FIRST GOT THE IDEA
FOR HARNESSING SPIRIT POWER

255
00:13:15,333 --> 00:13:17,583
WHEN I WATCHED
THAT GIANT UNALAQ MONSTER

256
00:13:17,625 --> 00:13:19,709
ATTACK THE CITY
FROM MY JAIL CELL.

257
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:22,750
THAT GIANT MONSTER
SET ME FREE.

258
00:13:22,792 --> 00:13:26,000
TRUST ME, KID.
I KNOW WHAT I'M DOING.

259
00:13:27,583 --> 00:13:31,041
[grunts]
THAT OUGHT TO DO IT.

260
00:13:31,083 --> 00:13:33,000
HUH.

261
00:13:34,291 --> 00:13:37,208
OKAY, STAND BACK.

262
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:38,250
[device beeping]
THERE WE GO.

263
00:13:38,291 --> 00:13:39,959
- WHAT'S THAT TICKING?

264
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,291
- THAT'S THE TIMER.

265
00:13:41,333 --> 00:13:42,834
- THE TIMER FOR WHAT?

266
00:13:42,875 --> 00:13:44,417
- FOR THE BOMB, OF COURSE!

267
00:13:44,458 --> 00:13:46,041
- WHAT?
WHAT BOMB?

268
00:13:46,083 --> 00:13:48,250
- THE BOMB THAT'S GOING
TO EXPLODE IN FIVE MINUTES

269
00:13:48,291 --> 00:13:51,041
AND DESTROY THIS ENTIRE TRAIN,
ALL OF THE SPIRIT VINES,

270
00:13:51,083 --> 00:13:53,542
AND EVERYTHING ELSE
WITHIN A FEW HUNDRED YARDS.

271
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:56,375
YOU KNOW WHAT, I'D GET
OUT OF HERE IF I WERE YOU.

272
00:13:56,417 --> 00:13:58,125
THIS IS THE FIRST TIME
I'VE BUILT A TIMER,

273
00:13:58,166 --> 00:14:00,125
AND IT MIGHT RUN
A LITTLE FAST.

274
00:14:00,166 --> 00:14:01,792
BOLIN AND I ARE READY
TO GO DOWN WITH THE SHIP--

275
00:14:01,834 --> 00:14:03,166
OR TRAIN IN THIS CASE--

276
00:14:03,208 --> 00:14:05,542
BUT YOU SEEM LIKE
YOU HAVE A LOT TO LIVE FOR.

277
00:14:05,583 --> 00:14:08,625
- NO, NO, NO, NO!
I'M NOT READY TO GO DOWN
WITH THE SHIP OR THE TRAIN!

278
00:14:08,667 --> 00:14:09,625
- YOU'RE BLUFFING.

279
00:14:09,667 --> 00:14:11,542
- STICK AROUND FIVE MINUTES,

280
00:14:11,583 --> 00:14:13,333
AND YOU'LL FIND OUT
WHO'S BLUFFING.

281
00:14:13,375 --> 00:14:15,750
YOU'LL BE SORRY YOU LEFT ME,
ZHU LI!

282
00:14:15,792 --> 00:14:17,041
WHEN THEY WRITE
THE HISTORY BOOKS,

283
00:14:17,083 --> 00:14:19,917
YOUR NAME WILL BE
SYNONYMOUS WITH BETRAYAL!

284
00:14:19,959 --> 00:14:21,583
PEOPLE WILL SAY, "HEY,
WHAT HAPPENED TO THAT GUY?"

285
00:14:21,625 --> 00:14:23,166
"OH, DIDN'T YOU HEAR,

286
00:14:23,208 --> 00:14:26,000
HE VARRICK'D HIMSELF
BECAUSE SOME GIRL ZHU LI'D HIM!"

287
00:14:26,041 --> 00:14:27,792
- ENOUGH.
- [whimpers]

288
00:14:27,834 --> 00:14:30,667
- WHAT MAKES YOU THINK
WE'D LET YOU BLOW YOURSELF UP?

289
00:14:30,709 --> 00:14:32,333
YOU'RE WORKING FOR KUVIRA.

290
00:14:32,375 --> 00:14:33,875
YOU DON'T GET TO QUIT.

291
00:14:33,917 --> 00:14:35,834
GRAB HIM.

292
00:14:38,041 --> 00:14:39,834
- YOU TRY TO PULL ME AWAY
FROM THIS THING,

293
00:14:39,875 --> 00:14:42,583
AND I'LL HIT THIS REMOTE
AND BLOW IT IMMEDIATELY.

294
00:14:42,625 --> 00:14:44,875
- WHY DO YOU HAVE
A TIMER AND A REMOTE?

295
00:14:44,917 --> 00:14:46,917
- WELL, FIRST I BUILT THE TIMER,
BUT THEN I THOUGHT

296
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:48,917
YOU COULD DRAG ME OFF THE TRAIN,
SO THEN I BUILT A REMOTE.

297
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:50,333
BUT THEN I THOUGHT,
"WELL, NOW,

298
00:14:50,375 --> 00:14:51,583
"DO I REALLY NEED
THE TIMER ANYMORE?

299
00:14:51,625 --> 00:14:53,000
BECAUSE I GOT A REMOTE
IN MY"--

300
00:14:53,041 --> 00:14:55,041
WHATEVER!
I'M COVERING ALL MY BASES!

301
00:14:55,083 --> 00:14:58,375
THE POINT IS, YOU'RE LEAVING.
WE'RE STAYING.

302
00:14:58,417 --> 00:15:01,125
- [grunting]

303
00:15:10,917 --> 00:15:13,250
- YOU HAVE TO GO
INTO THE AVATAR STATE!

304
00:15:13,291 --> 00:15:15,291
DO IT!

305
00:15:52,166 --> 00:15:55,625
- [groans]

306
00:15:55,667 --> 00:15:57,375
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

307
00:15:57,417 --> 00:15:58,625
WE GOT THE POISON OUT.

308
00:15:58,667 --> 00:16:01,000
WHAT'S WRONG WITH HER?

309
00:16:03,667 --> 00:16:07,250
- I KNEW YOU WERE WEAK.

310
00:16:07,291 --> 00:16:09,291
- [gasps]

311
00:16:34,458 --> 00:16:36,917
- [groaning]

312
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
YOU BROKE OUR AGREEMENT!

313
00:16:42,041 --> 00:16:43,375
ATTACK!

314
00:16:43,417 --> 00:16:45,875
[all cheering]

315
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,917
[men screaming]

316
00:17:03,083 --> 00:17:07,000
- KEEP THEM BACK!
I'M CALLING FOR HELP.

317
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:14,083
[soft jazz music]

318
00:17:14,125 --> 00:17:16,000
- STUNNING WORK, IKKI.

319
00:17:16,041 --> 00:17:19,917
IT HURTS MY EYES
WITH ITS RAW EMOTIONAL POWER.

320
00:17:27,375 --> 00:17:29,083
AH, PEDESTRIAN.

321
00:17:29,125 --> 00:17:31,709
I ALREADY KNOW WHAT YOU
LOOK LIKE ON THE OUTSIDE.

322
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:34,750
I WANT YOU TO SHOW ME
THE INNER MEELO.

323
00:17:37,125 --> 00:17:38,667
- HELP!

324
00:17:38,709 --> 00:17:41,000
YOU HAVE TO GET KORRA
AND THE REST OF US OUT OF HERE
NOW!

325
00:17:41,041 --> 00:17:41,917
HURRY!

326
00:17:41,959 --> 00:17:44,792
- FINALLY!
LET'S GET IT ON!

327
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,041
- THIS IS EVERYONE.
OUR HALF OF THE TRAIN IS CLEAR.

328
00:17:49,083 --> 00:17:51,458
- THAT'S GOOD.
WE'RE ALMOST OUT OF TIME.

329
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:52,667
- YOU'RE INSANE.

330
00:17:52,709 --> 00:17:54,542
- YOU KNEW THAT
WHEN YOU HIRED ME.

331
00:17:54,583 --> 00:17:56,375
BOLIN, DO THE THING.

332
00:17:56,417 --> 00:17:57,542
- UH...

333
00:17:57,583 --> 00:17:59,041
- UNHOOK THE CARS!

334
00:17:59,083 --> 00:18:01,625
OH, COME ON,
THAT WAS AN EASY ONE!

335
00:18:08,542 --> 00:18:10,041
- MAN, THAT WAS GREAT.

336
00:18:10,083 --> 00:18:12,125
I GOTTA ADMIT, YOU HAD ME
GOING THERE FOR A WHILE.

337
00:18:12,166 --> 00:18:14,083
I REALLY THOUGHT
YOU WERE GOING TO BLOW US UP.

338
00:18:14,125 --> 00:18:16,375
NOW, HOW DO WE
TURN THIS THING OFF?

339
00:18:16,417 --> 00:18:19,083
- OH, WE CAN'T TURN IT OFF.
WE'RE GOING TO BLOW UP.

340
00:18:19,125 --> 00:18:21,041
BUT WE HAD A PRETTY GOOD RUN,
RIGHT?

341
00:18:21,083 --> 00:18:22,583
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT,
A GOOD RUN?

342
00:18:22,625 --> 00:18:25,083
I'M STILL RUNNING!
I LIKE RUNNING!

343
00:18:25,125 --> 00:18:28,458
