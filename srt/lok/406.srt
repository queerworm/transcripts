1
00:00:06,739 --> 00:00:08,273
Earth.

2
00:00:08,275 --> 00:00:10,175
Fire.

3
00:00:10,177 --> 00:00:11,943
Air.

4
00:00:11,945 --> 00:00:13,245
Water.

5
00:00:13,247 --> 00:00:17,482
Only the Avatar can
master all four elements

6
00:00:17,484 --> 00:00:19,942
and bring balance to the world.

7
00:00:26,145 --> 00:00:28,193
Kuvira threatens to take Zaofu by force.

8
00:00:28,195 --> 00:00:30,262
After tensions flared between Su Beifong

9
00:00:30,264 --> 00:00:33,198
and her former protege,
Korra brokered a truce.

10
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,200
But it was too late.

11
00:00:34,201 --> 00:00:36,134
Su and her sons were already on their way

12
00:00:36,136 --> 00:00:37,169
to put an end to Kuvira.

13
00:00:37,171 --> 00:00:39,137
Meanwhile, Bolin and
Varrick learned of Kuvira's

14
00:00:39,139 --> 00:00:41,673
true tyrannical intent
and deserted her army.

15
00:00:41,675 --> 00:00:43,542
But they were captured
and betrayed by Zhu Li.

16
00:00:43,544 --> 00:00:46,645
Now they're being held against their will.

17
00:01:06,599 --> 00:01:07,866
Are you sure this will work?

18
00:01:07,868 --> 00:01:11,136
Even without Kuvira,
they could still crush us.

19
00:01:11,138 --> 00:01:12,704
Most of this army has been forced

20
00:01:12,706 --> 00:01:13,772
into service by Kuvira.

21
00:01:13,774 --> 00:01:16,641
If we take her out, they'll
have no reason to fight.

22
00:01:16,643 --> 00:01:21,747
Tonight we end her reign of terror.

23
00:01:55,381 --> 00:01:57,282
She's alone in there.

24
00:01:57,284 --> 00:02:01,386
Now's our chance.

25
00:02:09,529 --> 00:02:12,497
- Don't hurt me!
- Zhu Li?

26
00:02:19,539 --> 00:02:21,740
I knew you'd try a sneak attack.

27
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:24,142
You were afraid to step up
and lead the earth kingdom

28
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:27,679
when you had the chance,
you were afraid to join me

29
00:02:27,681 --> 00:02:28,947
when I became the leader,

30
00:02:28,949 --> 00:02:31,616
and now you're afraid of a fair fight.

31
00:02:31,618 --> 00:02:34,719
You've always been a coward.

32
00:02:34,721 --> 00:02:38,423
Take them.

33
00:02:39,192 --> 00:02:40,759
Korra, you have to go stop Su

34
00:02:40,761 --> 00:02:42,627
before she does something terrible.

35
00:02:42,629 --> 00:02:44,696
Stop her? We should be helping her!

36
00:02:44,698 --> 00:02:48,600
We have no idea where your
mom is or what her plan is.

37
00:02:48,602 --> 00:02:50,402
If we go charging into Kuvira's camp,

38
00:02:50,404 --> 00:02:53,338
we could get them all captured or worse.

39
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:55,340
All we can do now is wait.

40
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:58,243
Attention, citizens of Zaofu.

41
00:02:58,245 --> 00:03:01,947
Your leader, Su Beifong,
attempted to attack me

42
00:03:01,949 --> 00:03:06,151
tonight while I slept,
ignoring the terms of our truce.

43
00:03:06,153 --> 00:03:10,755
Luckily, I now have her and
her assault team in custody.

44
00:03:10,757 --> 00:03:11,590
No.

45
00:03:11,592 --> 00:03:14,259
Rest assured that I will not take revenge

46
00:03:14,261 --> 00:03:16,595
on the peaceful citizens of Zaofu,

47
00:03:16,597 --> 00:03:18,864
as long as your remaining representatives

48
00:03:18,866 --> 00:03:21,600
meet me outside the city at dawn to offer

49
00:03:21,602 --> 00:03:26,204
the full and unconditional
surrender of your city.

50
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:27,005
That is all.

51
00:03:27,007 --> 00:03:30,175
Korra, you can't let
Kuvira get away with this.

52
00:03:30,177 --> 00:03:32,477
We have to go break
out mom and my brothers.

53
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:34,279
You swore an oath of nonaggression

54
00:03:34,281 --> 00:03:35,981
when you became an airbender.

55
00:03:35,983 --> 00:03:38,250
You can't just attack Kuvira.

56
00:03:38,252 --> 00:03:39,651
I don't care about the oath.

57
00:03:39,653 --> 00:03:41,486
I have to save my family.

58
00:03:41,488 --> 00:03:42,821
No, Jinora is right.

59
00:03:42,823 --> 00:03:44,489
Your mom attacked the camp.

60
00:03:44,491 --> 00:03:47,492
Kuvira was just defending herself.

61
00:03:47,494 --> 00:03:48,660
Defending herself?

62
00:03:48,662 --> 00:03:50,395
She was going to attack our city!

63
00:03:50,397 --> 00:03:52,797
I can't believe you're refusing to fight.

64
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:55,834
Why is that loudspeaker lady talking

65
00:03:55,836 --> 00:03:58,904
when I'm trying to sleep?

66
00:03:58,906 --> 00:04:00,438
Korra, what are we going to do?

67
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:02,707
Jinora and I will go
talk to Kuvira at dawn,

68
00:04:02,709 --> 00:04:04,542
and maybe we can work something out.

69
00:04:04,544 --> 00:04:08,847
I promise I'll do everything
I can to keep the peace.

70
00:04:08,849 --> 00:04:09,981
I'll go with you.

71
00:04:09,983 --> 00:04:11,516
- We'll go, too.
- No.

72
00:04:11,518 --> 00:04:14,719
Dad told us to find
Korra, and we found her.

73
00:04:14,721 --> 00:04:16,454
Now you need to stay safe.

74
00:04:16,456 --> 00:04:18,590
Come on, let us help.

75
00:04:18,592 --> 00:04:20,992
I can't risk anyone else being captured.

76
00:04:20,994 --> 00:04:22,527
You can stay with Baatar and Huan

77
00:04:22,529 --> 00:04:24,262
while I work this out with Kuvira.

78
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:25,797
Make sure they get back to Tenzin safely

79
00:04:25,799 --> 00:04:28,300
if anything goes wrong.

80
00:04:28,302 --> 00:04:29,000
Aw, man.

81
00:04:29,002 --> 00:04:32,737
When am I gonna see some action?

82
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:37,475
Cookie jar empty.

83
00:04:37,477 --> 00:04:40,512
No hot towels.

84
00:04:40,514 --> 00:04:42,514
Waxy buildup.

85
00:04:42,516 --> 00:04:44,883
Zhu Li!

86
00:04:46,586 --> 00:04:50,755
Aw, she really is gone.

87
00:04:52,658 --> 00:04:55,727
Up and at 'em, Varrick. Time to go to work.

88
00:04:55,729 --> 00:04:57,762
We have another lab set up for you.

89
00:04:57,764 --> 00:05:00,899
Kuvira wants the spirit
vine weapon operational

90
00:05:00,901 --> 00:05:02,033
as soon as possible.

91
00:05:02,035 --> 00:05:04,636
Zhu Li always greeted me in the morning

92
00:05:04,638 --> 00:05:06,604
with a... a hot cup of tea.

93
00:05:06,606 --> 00:05:09,374
You'll get your tea when you start working.

94
00:05:09,376 --> 00:05:10,742
Well, I'm really only productive

95
00:05:10,744 --> 00:05:11,776
for about 15 minutes a day,

96
00:05:11,778 --> 00:05:16,414
usually in the afternoon around 3:45.

97
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:17,882
You'll work now.

98
00:05:17,884 --> 00:05:21,019
I want you to show me how the device works.

99
00:05:21,021 --> 00:05:22,854
What's going on?

100
00:05:22,856 --> 00:05:25,156
Go back to sleep. We only need Varrick.

101
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:28,493
You'll need your energy when
you get to the reeducation camp.

102
00:05:28,495 --> 00:05:31,596
I can't be expected to
work without an assistant.

103
00:05:31,598 --> 00:05:33,365
Without Zhu Li, I'm helpless.

104
00:05:33,367 --> 00:05:36,468
One of the guards will be your assistant.

105
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:37,470
I'll be supervising.

106
00:05:37,471 --> 00:05:38,636
Well, I guess he'll be fine,

107
00:05:38,638 --> 00:05:41,639
as long as he doesn't
need his hands afterwards.

108
00:05:42,075 --> 00:05:43,875
What's he talking about, sir?

109
00:05:43,877 --> 00:05:45,977
The last time we worked
with the spirit vines,

110
00:05:45,979 --> 00:05:48,480
it created an uncontrollable blast

111
00:05:48,482 --> 00:05:50,048
that burned through a
wall and could still be

112
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:51,916
blowing up comets in
space, as far as I know.

113
00:05:51,918 --> 00:05:55,453
I wouldn't want to assist me if I were you.

114
00:05:55,455 --> 00:05:58,790
Maybe we should just
let the kid help him out.

115
00:05:58,792 --> 00:06:01,126
Fine. Bolin can assist.

116
00:06:01,128 --> 00:06:03,528
Wait, what? I need my hands! Uh, hold on.

117
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:09,367
Can we get breakfast first?
While we still have hands?

118
00:06:20,513 --> 00:06:21,446
Release them now!

119
00:06:21,448 --> 00:06:24,883
If Su agrees to bow to
me and turn over Zaofu,

120
00:06:24,885 --> 00:06:28,520
she and the rest of your
family will not be harmed.

121
00:06:28,522 --> 00:06:31,089
Never! I'll never bow to you!

122
00:06:31,091 --> 00:06:33,958
There must be some way
for us to resolve this.

123
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,794
I've already laid out my terms,

124
00:06:35,796 --> 00:06:38,029
and I think they're very reasonable.

125
00:06:38,031 --> 00:06:40,465
After all, Su did try to take me out

126
00:06:40,467 --> 00:06:42,567
during our peaceful negotiations.

127
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:46,938
You call bringing an army to
threaten our city peaceful?

128
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:47,772
Where's Bolin?

129
00:06:47,774 --> 00:06:49,808
I know he would never go along with this!

130
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:51,076
Bolin is with my fiance,

131
00:06:51,078 --> 00:06:53,111
working on something very important,

132
00:06:53,113 --> 00:06:56,481
but I assure you he's
on board with my plans.

133
00:06:56,483 --> 00:06:58,750
You two have been apart for some time.

134
00:06:58,752 --> 00:07:02,620
I guess you don't realize
how much Bolin has grown up.

135
00:07:02,622 --> 00:07:04,834
Now turn over Zaofu.

136
00:07:04,856 --> 00:07:07,156
I can't just let you take the city.

137
00:07:07,158 --> 00:07:09,992
Avatar Korra, you are interfering

138
00:07:09,994 --> 00:07:12,361
with internal earth empire business

139
00:07:12,363 --> 00:07:14,296
and letting your personal feelings

140
00:07:14,298 --> 00:07:15,464
get in the way of reason.

141
00:07:15,466 --> 00:07:19,135
Zaofu cannot continue to rule itself.

142
00:07:19,137 --> 00:07:21,036
They have been hoarding their riches

143
00:07:21,038 --> 00:07:22,471
and technology too long.

144
00:07:22,473 --> 00:07:25,741
I'm here to distribute
those resources fairly

145
00:07:25,743 --> 00:07:27,109
throughout the nation.

146
00:07:27,111 --> 00:07:29,478
This is about equality.

147
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:31,847
You don't care about equality!

148
00:07:31,849 --> 00:07:33,249
This is about control!

149
00:07:33,251 --> 00:07:34,216
Just take her down.

150
00:07:34,218 --> 00:07:35,985
You know it's the right thing to do.

151
00:07:35,987 --> 00:07:36,987
You have to stop this!

152
00:07:36,988 --> 00:07:39,989
The only way you're going
to keep me from marching

153
00:07:39,991 --> 00:07:43,259
into Zaofu is if you physically stop me.

154
00:07:43,261 --> 00:07:44,860
Now what are you going to do?

155
00:07:44,862 --> 00:07:48,431
It looks like you're
not giving me a choice.

156
00:07:48,433 --> 00:07:49,298
Fine.

157
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:52,168
I want you all to know that I would never

158
00:07:52,170 --> 00:07:53,569
ask any of you to do something

159
00:07:53,571 --> 00:07:56,338
that I'm not willing to do myself.

160
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:58,374
So rather than risk your lives,

161
00:07:58,376 --> 00:08:02,378
I will fight the
Avatar one-on-one.

162
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:03,512
Korra, if you win,

163
00:08:03,514 --> 00:08:06,916
then you can do whatever
you want with Zaofu.

164
00:08:06,918 --> 00:08:08,117
But after I beat you,

165
00:08:08,119 --> 00:08:10,553
I want you out of my business for good.

166
00:08:10,555 --> 00:08:15,090
I'm the one who brought peace
to the earth empire, not you.

167
00:08:15,092 --> 00:08:17,092
You're not relevant here anymore.

168
00:08:17,094 --> 00:08:19,295
Fine. You want to fight the Avatar?

169
00:08:19,297 --> 00:08:23,999
Then let's finish this
right here, right now!

170
00:08:34,578 --> 00:08:36,946
Are you really ready to fight her?

171
00:08:36,948 --> 00:08:39,515
Just stay back and let me handle this.

172
00:08:39,517 --> 00:08:40,449
It's been a while,

173
00:08:40,451 --> 00:08:42,418
but I got a lot of pent-up rage.

174
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:44,720
Don't mess around. Kuvira is too good.

175
00:08:44,722 --> 00:08:47,590
Just go into the Avatar
state and get it over with.

176
00:08:47,592 --> 00:08:52,261
No, I'm only going to
use that as a last resort.

177
00:08:52,263 --> 00:08:54,997
Be careful.

178
00:08:58,201 --> 00:09:01,070
Use whatever you want, all the elements,

179
00:09:01,072 --> 00:09:04,340
the Avatar state, anything you need.

180
00:09:04,342 --> 00:09:07,142
I know you're a little rusty.

181
00:09:07,144 --> 00:09:10,479
Enough talk.

182
00:09:25,396 --> 00:09:29,298
Looks like the Avatar
is a little off her game.

183
00:09:32,203 --> 00:09:34,003
Don't let her get you frustrated!

184
00:09:34,005 --> 00:09:37,439
She wants you to make a mistake!

185
00:10:18,648 --> 00:10:19,815
Bolin, do the thing.

186
00:10:19,817 --> 00:10:21,450
- What thing?
- The thing!

187
00:10:21,452 --> 00:10:24,186
I never had to tell Zhu Li what thing!

188
00:10:24,188 --> 00:10:25,188
I'm not Zhu Li, okay?

189
00:10:25,189 --> 00:10:26,388
Pretend I don't know anything

190
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:27,690
about anything that's happening here.

191
00:10:27,692 --> 00:10:30,192
Also pretend I don't want
to build a super weapon

192
00:10:30,194 --> 00:10:33,095
or get my hands blown off.

193
00:10:38,668 --> 00:10:40,436
Walk me through what you're doing.

194
00:10:40,438 --> 00:10:42,438
I want to know every detail of your work.

195
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:44,139
You know, when I started
working with the vines,

196
00:10:44,141 --> 00:10:47,309
the point was to find a clean,
unlimited source of energy,

197
00:10:47,311 --> 00:10:50,012
not develop some spirity death ray.

198
00:10:50,014 --> 00:10:51,480
Clean energy, sounds great!

199
00:10:51,482 --> 00:10:54,583
Who doesn't like that
stuff? Let's do that instead.

200
00:10:54,585 --> 00:10:55,284
Quiet.

201
00:10:55,286 --> 00:10:57,353
You're here to help, not talk.

202
00:10:57,355 --> 00:10:59,688
And you of all people should realize

203
00:10:59,690 --> 00:11:01,690
that once a discovery is made,

204
00:11:01,692 --> 00:11:03,359
it is our responsibility as scientists

205
00:11:03,361 --> 00:11:07,329
to pursue it as far as
we can, wherever it leads.

206
00:11:07,331 --> 00:11:08,497
How would you know?

207
00:11:08,499 --> 00:11:09,865
You couldn't discover a wolf-bat

208
00:11:09,867 --> 00:11:12,434
if it was building a nest in your butt.

209
00:11:12,436 --> 00:11:14,837
Ooh.

210
00:11:14,839 --> 00:11:16,238
You're pathetic.

211
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,440
Wolf-bats don't build nests.

212
00:11:18,442 --> 00:11:20,776
Ooh, you got me there, Dr. science.

213
00:11:20,778 --> 00:11:25,214
You'll never know how it
feels to give birth to genius,

214
00:11:25,216 --> 00:11:28,317
only to have it kidnapped
and raised by fools.

215
00:11:28,319 --> 00:11:29,585
Are you done with your rambling,

216
00:11:29,587 --> 00:11:31,654
or do the guards need to encourage you

217
00:11:31,656 --> 00:11:33,222
to continue your work?

218
00:11:33,224 --> 00:11:35,157
Okay, okay, okay.

219
00:11:35,159 --> 00:11:37,726
The last time we ran the
current through the vine,

220
00:11:37,728 --> 00:11:39,028
we couldn't control the power.

221
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:44,433
So I'm trying something new
to see if I can direct it.

222
00:12:36,253 --> 00:12:37,820
Come on, Avatar.

223
00:12:37,822 --> 00:12:38,754
Get up.

224
00:12:38,756 --> 00:12:40,322
Show me what you've got.

225
00:12:40,324 --> 00:12:42,858
We have to help her.

226
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:46,128
No. Stay back.

227
00:12:46,130 --> 00:12:49,732
I can handle this.

228
00:12:49,734 --> 00:12:52,301
So I see how the current
interacts with the vine,

229
00:12:52,303 --> 00:12:54,470
and here is a kind of directional tube,

230
00:12:54,472 --> 00:12:56,405
but this baffling here at the base...

231
00:12:57,208 --> 00:12:59,441
It looks like that would
only redirect the energy

232
00:12:59,443 --> 00:13:00,676
right back where it came from.

233
00:13:00,678 --> 00:13:03,245
And what's that piece of
equipment you're fiddling with

234
00:13:03,247 --> 00:13:04,613
now on the power source?

235
00:13:04,615 --> 00:13:06,615
Hand me the
screw-turn-thingy, would ya?

236
00:13:06,617 --> 00:13:08,951
Ugh, I can't believe you're helping them.

237
00:13:08,953 --> 00:13:10,519
You know this isn't right.

238
00:13:10,521 --> 00:13:11,487
Funny story, Bolin.

239
00:13:11,489 --> 00:13:14,289
I first got the idea for
harnessing spirit power

240
00:13:14,291 --> 00:13:16,592
when I watched that giant Unalaq monster

241
00:13:16,594 --> 00:13:18,761
attack the city from my jail cell.

242
00:13:18,763 --> 00:13:21,697
That giant monster set me free.

243
00:13:21,699 --> 00:13:26,135
Trust me, kid. I know what I'm doing.

244
00:13:26,703 --> 00:13:30,739
That ought to do it.

245
00:13:30,741 --> 00:13:33,142
Huh.

246
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:36,445
Okay, stand back.

247
00:13:36,447 --> 00:13:37,613
There we go.

248
00:13:37,615 --> 00:13:39,414
What's that ticking?

249
00:13:39,416 --> 00:13:40,649
That's the timer.

250
00:13:40,651 --> 00:13:42,217
The timer for what?

251
00:13:42,219 --> 00:13:43,752
For the bomb, of course!

252
00:13:43,754 --> 00:13:44,720
What? What bomb?

253
00:13:44,722 --> 00:13:46,855
The bomb that's going to
explode in five minutes

254
00:13:46,857 --> 00:13:49,758
and destroy this entire
train, all of the spirit vines,

255
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:52,361
and everything else
within a few hundred yards.

256
00:13:52,363 --> 00:13:55,330
You know what, I'd get
out of here if I were you.

257
00:13:55,332 --> 00:13:57,366
This is the first time I've built a timer,

258
00:13:57,368 --> 00:13:58,767
and it might run a little fast.

259
00:13:58,769 --> 00:14:00,836
Bolin and I are ready to
go down with the ship...

260
00:14:00,838 --> 00:14:01,870
or train in this case...

261
00:14:01,872 --> 00:14:04,907
but you seem like you
have a lot to live for.

262
00:14:04,909 --> 00:14:05,808
No, no, no, no!

263
00:14:05,810 --> 00:14:07,709
I'm not ready to go down
with the ship or the train!

264
00:14:07,711 --> 00:14:08,777
You're bluffing.

265
00:14:08,779 --> 00:14:10,512
Stick around five minutes,

266
00:14:10,514 --> 00:14:12,347
and you'll find out who's bluffing.

267
00:14:12,349 --> 00:14:14,716
You'll be sorry you left me, Zhu Li!

268
00:14:14,718 --> 00:14:16,018
When they write the history books,

269
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:18,587
your name will be synonymous with betrayal!

270
00:14:18,589 --> 00:14:20,856
People will say, "hey,
what happened to that guy?"

271
00:14:20,858 --> 00:14:21,990
"Oh, didn't you hear,

272
00:14:21,992 --> 00:14:25,360
he Varrick'd himself because
some girl Zhu Li'd him!"

273
00:14:25,362 --> 00:14:26,461
Enough.

274
00:14:26,463 --> 00:14:29,865
What makes you think we'd
let you blow yourself up?

275
00:14:29,867 --> 00:14:31,667
You're working for Kuvira.

276
00:14:31,669 --> 00:14:33,535
You don't get to quit.

277
00:14:33,537 --> 00:14:35,804
Grab him.

278
00:14:37,073 --> 00:14:38,640
You try to pull me away from this thing,

279
00:14:38,642 --> 00:14:41,543
and I'll hit this remote
and blow it immediately.

280
00:14:41,545 --> 00:14:43,612
Why do you have a timer and a remote?

281
00:14:43,614 --> 00:14:45,547
Well, first I built the
timer, but then I thought

282
00:14:45,549 --> 00:14:47,983
you could drag me off the
train, so then I built a remote.

283
00:14:47,985 --> 00:14:49,418
But then I thought, "well, now",

284
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:50,719
"do I really need the timer anymore?

285
00:14:50,721 --> 00:14:51,954
Because I got a remote in my"...

286
00:14:51,956 --> 00:14:53,822
whatever! I'm covering all my bases!

287
00:14:53,824 --> 00:14:57,893
The point is, you're
leaving. We're staying.

288
00:15:09,286 --> 00:15:12,355
You have to go into the Avatar state!

289
00:15:12,357 --> 00:15:14,858
Do it!

290
00:15:54,633 --> 00:15:56,232
I don't understand.

291
00:15:56,234 --> 00:15:57,567
We got the poison out.

292
00:15:57,569 --> 00:16:00,403
What's wrong with her?

293
00:16:02,339 --> 00:16:06,309
I knew you were weak.

294
00:16:38,876 --> 00:16:41,144
You broke our agreement!

295
00:16:41,146 --> 00:16:42,345
Attack!

296
00:17:01,365 --> 00:17:06,603
Keep them back! I'm calling for help.

297
00:17:12,944 --> 00:17:14,444
Stunning work, Ikki.

298
00:17:14,446 --> 00:17:19,549
It hurts my eyes with
its raw emotional power.

299
00:17:26,457 --> 00:17:27,457
Ah, pedestrian.

300
00:17:27,459 --> 00:17:30,159
I already know what you
look like on the outside.

301
00:17:30,161 --> 00:17:34,230
I want you to show me the inner Meelo.

302
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:36,733
Help!

303
00:17:36,735 --> 00:17:38,468
You have to get Korra and the rest of us

304
00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:40,169
out of here now!

305
00:17:40,171 --> 00:17:40,737
Hurry!

306
00:17:40,739 --> 00:17:44,274
Finally! Let's get it on!

307
00:17:45,109 --> 00:17:47,610
This is everyone. Our
half of the train is clear.

308
00:17:47,612 --> 00:17:50,413
That's good. We're almost out of time.

309
00:17:50,415 --> 00:17:51,180
You're insane.

310
00:17:51,182 --> 00:17:53,583
You knew that when you hired me.

311
00:17:53,585 --> 00:17:55,652
Bolin, do the thing.

312
00:17:55,654 --> 00:17:56,619
Uh...

313
00:17:56,621 --> 00:17:57,621
Unhook the cars!

314
00:17:57,622 --> 00:18:02,091
Oh, come on, that was an easy one!

315
00:18:07,264 --> 00:18:08,431
Man, that was great.

316
00:18:08,433 --> 00:18:10,333
I gotta admit, you had me
going there for a while.

317
00:18:10,335 --> 00:18:12,669
I really thought you
were going to blow us up.

318
00:18:12,671 --> 00:18:14,404
Now, how do we turn this thing off?

319
00:18:14,406 --> 00:18:17,640
Oh, we can't turn it off.
We're going to blow up.

320
00:18:17,642 --> 00:18:19,809
But we had a pretty good run, right?

321
00:18:19,811 --> 00:18:21,377
What are you talking about, a good run?

322
00:18:21,379 --> 00:18:24,614
I'm still running! I like running!

323
00:18:36,293 --> 00:18:41,431
I'll see you on the other side, Zhu Li.

324
00:18:41,433 --> 00:18:45,401
I want you to know, I hate you.

325
00:18:54,578 --> 00:18:57,513
I can't believe he
actually blew himself up.

326
00:18:57,515 --> 00:19:02,118
That man was crazier than
a sewer-pipe elephant rat.

327
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:05,321
Let's get back to Zaofu.

328
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,500
Yes! You did it, Bolin.

329
00:19:17,502 --> 00:19:19,302
You did the thing.

330
00:19:19,304 --> 00:19:21,237
Mwah!

331
00:19:21,239 --> 00:19:21,904
I can't believe.

332
00:19:21,906 --> 00:19:26,009
Zhu Li worked for you as long as she did.

333
00:19:43,494 --> 00:19:46,396
Dive, pepper! Dive!

334
00:19:46,398 --> 00:19:49,399
Here comes a hurricane!

335
00:19:51,502 --> 00:19:54,637
You can't handle all this Meelo!

336
00:19:54,639 --> 00:19:58,307
We've got her! Go!

337
00:19:59,343 --> 00:20:01,277
We have to save them!

338
00:20:01,279 --> 00:20:03,246
Opal, get out of here!

339
00:20:03,248 --> 00:20:04,647
We'll be fine!

340
00:20:04,649 --> 00:20:05,348
Just go!

341
00:20:05,350 --> 00:20:09,152
I'll be back for you! I love you!

342
00:20:13,691 --> 00:20:16,426
Zaofu is ours!

343
00:20:25,703 --> 00:20:28,705
Bring the citizens of Zaofu to kneel

344
00:20:28,707 --> 00:20:30,640
before the Great Uniter.

345
00:20:30,642 --> 00:20:33,209
All who pledge their loyalty to me

346
00:20:33,211 --> 00:20:35,511
will keep their freedom
and be dealt with fairly

347
00:20:35,513 --> 00:20:38,715
as full citizens of the earth empire.

348
00:20:38,717 --> 00:20:41,551
The rest will be imprisoned as traitors,

349
00:20:41,553 --> 00:20:45,321
like Su Beifong and her sons.

350
00:20:45,323 --> 00:20:47,757
Now bow.

351
00:20:57,501 --> 00:20:59,769
Bow to her! Do it!

352
00:20:59,771 --> 00:21:03,439
She is your rightful leader!

353
00:21:04,508 --> 00:21:08,511
I'm so disappointed in you, junior.

354
00:21:09,279 --> 00:21:11,447
Take them away!

355
00:21:11,449 --> 00:21:12,882
Get your hands off me.

356
00:21:12,884 --> 00:21:16,319
You're crushing my individuality.

357
00:21:16,321 --> 00:21:19,655
All hail the Great Uniter!

358
00:21:30,801 --> 00:21:33,669
Are you sure there's no way they survived?

359
00:21:33,671 --> 00:21:36,405
Positive, but I think
I can replicate his work

360
00:21:36,407 --> 00:21:40,376
with the spirit vines
and get us back on track.

361
00:21:40,378 --> 00:21:44,347
I'll just need an assistant.

362
00:21:46,950 --> 00:21:49,252
How would you like to help Baatar build

363
00:21:49,254 --> 00:21:52,755
the most powerful weapon
the world has ever seen?

364
00:21:52,757 --> 00:21:57,326
It would be my honor, Great Uniter.

365
00:22:00,697 --> 00:22:04,934
Begin dismantling the domes.
