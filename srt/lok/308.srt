1
00:00:06,508 --> 00:00:07,675
- Tenzin: EARTH.

2
00:00:08,384 --> 00:00:09,469
FIRE.

3
00:00:10,178 --> 00:00:11,262
AIR.

4
00:00:11,930 --> 00:00:12,931
WATER.

5
00:00:14,057 --> 00:00:17,936
ONLY THE AVATAR
CAN MASTER ALL FOUR ELEMENTS

6
00:00:18,102 --> 00:00:20,230
AND BRING BALANCE TO THE WORLD.

7
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:28,571
Shirc: KORRA IS NOW THE
FIRST METAL-BENDING AVATAR.

8
00:00:28,738 --> 00:00:30,240
AFTER TRAINING WITH SU BEIFONG,

9
00:00:30,323 --> 00:00:31,908
KORRA QUICKLY PICKED UP
THE NEW SKILL.

10
00:00:31,991 --> 00:00:34,118
AND BOLIN IS HOPING
TO FOLLOW IN HER FOOTSTEPS.

11
00:00:34,285 --> 00:00:35,787
MEANWHILE, THE AIRBENDER ZAHEER

12
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:37,372
IS CLOSING IN ON ZAOFU.

13
00:00:37,455 --> 00:00:39,374
BY HIS SIDE,
ARE THE LAVABENDER GHAZAN

14
00:00:39,457 --> 00:00:42,544
THE WATERBENDER MING-HUA,
AND THE COMBUSTIONBENDER P'LI.

15
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:44,128
BUT WHAT DO THESE
MYSTERIOUS CRIMINALS

16
00:00:44,212 --> 00:00:45,505
WANT WITH THE AVATAR?

17
00:01:12,282 --> 00:01:14,826
I CAN'T BELIEVE I'M SPARRING
WITH THE AVATAR.

18
00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:16,703
I CAN'T BELIEVE I'M STUCK
WITH HER FRIEND.

19
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:19,122
Bclin: HANG ON, I THINK I GOT IT.

20
00:01:19,247 --> 00:01:21,291
LET ME JUST TRY THIS.

21
00:01:21,874 --> 00:01:23,626
NO? OKAY, MAYBE IF I...OW!

22
00:01:23,751 --> 00:01:25,044
TRIAL BY FIRE!

23
00:01:25,128 --> 00:01:26,796
IT'S THE BEST WAY
TO LEARN METAL-BENDING.

24
00:01:30,592 --> 00:01:33,261
OH, NICE SHOT, BOLIN.

25
00:01:33,469 --> 00:01:35,054
BUT I THOUGHT YOU WERE
SUPPOSED TO BE PRACTICING

26
00:01:35,138 --> 00:01:37,223
METAL-BENDING, NOT EARTH-BENDING.

27
00:01:37,348 --> 00:01:38,850
YEAH, CHEATER.

28
00:01:39,058 --> 00:01:41,686
MAKO, METAL-BENDING
IS EXTREMELY DIFFICULT.

29
00:01:41,853 --> 00:01:44,480
NO ONE GETS IT RIGHT AWAY,
IF THEY CAN GET IT AT ALL!

30
00:01:44,564 --> 00:01:45,773
IT'S NOT NORMAL!

31
00:01:51,904 --> 00:01:54,365
WHOO-HOO! METAL-BENDING CHAMPION.

32
00:01:54,699 --> 00:01:56,826
OH, SURE. SHE'S THE AVATAR.

33
00:01:57,035 --> 00:01:58,661
GUYS, IT'S TIME TO GET CLEANED UP.

34
00:01:59,037 --> 00:02:00,413
TONIGHT'S OPAL'S FAREWELL DINNER.

35
00:02:00,622 --> 00:02:03,041
NOW I GOTTA SAY BYE TO OPAL?

36
00:02:03,458 --> 00:02:05,209
THIS IS THE WORST DAY EVER!

37
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,637
THANKS FOR MAKING MY FAVORITE MEAL.

38
00:02:15,803 --> 00:02:17,597
I'M REALLY GOING TO MISS YOU, OPAL.

39
00:02:17,972 --> 00:02:21,225
NO ONE APPRECIATES
MY RAW VEGGIE WRAPS LIKE YOU DO.

40
00:02:21,809 --> 00:02:25,563
EVERY TIME I EAT RAW KALE,
I'M GONNA THINK OF YOU.

41
00:02:25,855 --> 00:02:27,190
YOU'RE SO SWEET.

42
00:02:27,857 --> 00:02:29,067
THIS STINKS.

43
00:02:29,275 --> 00:02:30,985
WE WERE JUST STARTING
TO GET TO KNOW EACH OTHER

44
00:02:31,069 --> 00:02:33,112
AND NOW YOU'RE OFF
TO THE NORTHERN AIR TEMPLE.

45
00:02:33,321 --> 00:02:34,739
WE'LL BE TOGETHER SOON.

46
00:02:34,906 --> 00:02:37,575
YOU GUYS ARE HEADING UP
AFTER FINDING MORE AIRBENDERS, RIGHT?

47
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:40,495
YEAH, BUT THAT'S... IN THE FUTURE.

48
00:02:40,578 --> 00:02:42,288
OH, I HATE THE FUTURE.

49
00:02:42,372 --> 00:02:45,166
UNTIL THEN, WE'LL ALWAYS HAVE KALE.

50
00:02:48,419 --> 00:02:50,546
KID, CAN I GIVE YOU
SOME RELATIONSHIP ADVICE?

51
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:52,090
UM, NO.

52
00:02:52,256 --> 00:02:53,508
WELL, YOUR LOSS.

53
00:02:53,591 --> 00:02:55,760
ZHU-LI! BRING THE, UH, THING.

54
00:02:57,136 --> 00:02:58,763
CHECK OUT MY LATEST INVENTION.

55
00:02:58,971 --> 00:03:00,890
AN AIRBENDER FINDER.

56
00:03:01,557 --> 00:03:03,434
WAIT, THAT CAN FIND AIRBENDERS?

57
00:03:07,897 --> 00:03:10,108
UH, I THINK IT'S BROKEN.

58
00:03:10,274 --> 00:03:12,985
IT'S NOT BROKEN.
SHE NEEDS TO AIR-BEND INTO IT!

59
00:03:13,069 --> 00:03:14,946
HOW ELSE DO YOU EXPECT
THE THING TO WORK?

60
00:03:15,613 --> 00:03:16,823
WHAT'S GOING ON?

61
00:03:17,073 --> 00:03:18,282
I CAN'T HEAR ANYTHING.

62
00:03:18,366 --> 00:03:19,951
I HATE SITTING DOWN HERE.

63
00:03:21,077 --> 00:03:22,453
NOT BECAUSE OF YOU.

64
00:03:22,829 --> 00:03:24,497
I CAN TELL YOU'RE LYING.

65
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:26,791
EVERYONE, IF I COULD HAVE
YOUR ATTENTION, PLEASE.

66
00:03:26,874 --> 00:03:28,751
TONIGHT, MY BEAUTIFUL
LITTLE GIRL LEAVES

67
00:03:28,835 --> 00:03:30,336
FOR THE NORTHERN AIR TEMPLE.

68
00:03:30,795 --> 00:03:32,964
OPAL, NONE OF US COULD BE
MORE PROUD OF YOU.

69
00:03:33,214 --> 00:03:36,467
YOU'RE AN INCREDIBLE DAUGHTER,
SISTER, FRIEND,

70
00:03:36,968 --> 00:03:39,137
AND SOON-TO-BE AIRBENDING MASTER.

71
00:03:43,141 --> 00:03:44,434
HERE'S TO OPAL.

72
00:03:44,559 --> 00:03:47,270
MAY SHE HELP LEAD US
INTO THE NEW ERA.

73
00:03:59,490 --> 00:04:01,075
LOCK IT DOWN FOR THE NIGHT.

74
00:04:03,327 --> 00:04:05,246
WE'LL HEAD OUT FIRST THING
IN THE MORNING.

75
00:04:40,573 --> 00:04:42,116
KALE, KALE, KALE.

76
00:04:46,162 --> 00:04:47,830
WHAT? WHAT'S GOING ON?

77
00:04:48,831 --> 00:04:50,374
PABU, SLEEP.

78
00:05:29,038 --> 00:05:30,581
WHAT? HUH? WHAT?

79
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,708
PABU.

80
00:05:33,251 --> 00:05:34,669
IT'S NOT PLAYTIME RIGHT NOW.

81
00:05:35,086 --> 00:05:36,546
OKAY, WE ARE SERIOUSLY
GOING TO HAVE TO HAVE A TALK.-

82
00:05:36,754 --> 00:05:37,755
WHAT THE HECK!

83
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:39,131
THEY GOT KORRA!

84
00:05:39,257 --> 00:05:40,424
THEY'VE GOT KORRA!

85
00:05:44,387 --> 00:05:45,596
LET HER GO!

86
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:00,945
THEY'VE GOT KORRA!

87
00:06:06,117 --> 00:06:08,035
SO MUCH FOR THE ELEMENT OF SURPRISE.

88
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,245
BACK.UP PLAN.

89
00:06:20,965 --> 00:06:22,466
WE CAN'T LET THEM TAKE HER.

90
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:24,385
I DON'T THINK
THEY'RE GOING TO GET FAR. LOOK.

91
00:06:35,521 --> 00:06:37,440
Female guard: WE HAVE YOU SURROUNDED.
IT'S OVER.

92
00:06:37,565 --> 00:06:38,900
RELEASE THE AVATAR!

93
00:06:56,334 --> 00:06:57,752
NO WAY!

94
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:00,338
THAT GUY'S LAVA-BENDING.
THAT'S AWESOME...

95
00:07:00,713 --> 00:07:02,340
- LY NOT GOOD FOR US.

96
00:07:14,226 --> 00:07:15,895
Zaheer: I'M GOING TO CREATE
SOME COVER.

97
00:07:15,978 --> 00:07:17,188
WE'RE GETTING OUT OF HERE.

98
00:07:45,549 --> 00:07:46,759
HOW DID THEY GET IN HERE?

99
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:50,304
I DON'T KNOW, BUT WE'RE NOT
LETTING THEM ESCAPE.

100
00:07:58,688 --> 00:07:59,730
Guards: WHOA!

101
00:08:01,273 --> 00:08:03,192
THERE'S NO WAY TO CROSS THAT MOAT.

102
00:08:07,154 --> 00:08:08,406
WE DON'T NEED TO CROSS IT.

103
00:08:08,656 --> 00:08:10,825
LIN AND I CAN DROP IN
FROM THE DOME ON CABLES.

104
00:08:10,908 --> 00:08:12,034
THAT'S A GREAT IDEA.

105
00:08:12,118 --> 00:08:13,494
EXCEPT, WE'LL GET BLOWN UP
THE SECOND

106
00:08:13,577 --> 00:08:15,162
THAT THIRD-EYED FREAK SEES US.

107
00:08:17,581 --> 00:08:19,917
SHE'S A COMBUSTIONBENDER.
IF ONE OF YOU CAN STUN HER,

108
00:08:20,001 --> 00:08:21,585
HER POWERS WILL BE
KNOCKED OUT TEMPORARILY.

109
00:08:22,044 --> 00:08:24,171
- BOLIN CAN LAND A SHOT.
- I CAN?

110
00:08:24,296 --> 00:08:26,424
YOU HAVE TO TAKE HER OUT
RIGHT BEFORE WE DROP DOWN.

111
00:08:27,091 --> 00:08:28,134
I DO?

112
00:08:35,516 --> 00:08:36,726
Wei: OPEN THE HATCH.

113
00:08:39,729 --> 00:08:41,605
IF WE GET IN TROUBLE, METAL-BEND US UP.

114
00:08:41,689 --> 00:08:42,815
WE'RE IN POSITION.

115
00:08:43,024 --> 00:08:44,817
COPY THAT. IT'S BOLIN TIME.

116
00:08:46,777 --> 00:08:50,656
ALL RIGHT. BOLIN TIME. BOLIN TIME!

117
00:09:01,542 --> 00:09:03,419
I CAN'T GET A CLEAN SHOT!

118
00:09:04,128 --> 00:09:05,296
YOU HAVE TO!

119
00:09:05,421 --> 00:09:07,131
- Wei: ARE WE A GO?
- NO GO.

120
00:09:07,214 --> 00:09:10,134
- COPY THAT. WE'RE A GO.
- I SAID NO! WAIT!

121
00:09:22,897 --> 00:09:24,148
BOLIN, TAKE THE SHOT!

122
00:09:32,865 --> 00:09:34,992
NICE JOB, LITTLE BRO.

123
00:09:57,223 --> 00:09:58,349
NO!

124
00:10:21,705 --> 00:10:23,040
THANKS.

125
00:10:26,836 --> 00:10:27,920
WE FAILED!

126
00:10:40,391 --> 00:10:41,642
Lin: WHERE DID THEY GO?

127
00:10:41,767 --> 00:10:42,935
THEY CAN'T BE FAR.

128
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:45,729
GUARDS, SEARCH THE ENTIRE ESTATE.

129
00:10:51,861 --> 00:10:54,405
THIS SHOULD NEUTRALIZE
THE SHIRASHU TOXINS.

130
00:10:58,325 --> 00:10:59,660
HOW COULD YOU LET THIS HAPPEN?

131
00:10:59,869 --> 00:11:01,453
YOU ASSURED ME THIS WAS
ONE OF THE MOST

132
00:11:01,537 --> 00:11:02,872
SECURE PLACES IN THE WORLD.

133
00:11:03,038 --> 00:11:05,332
IT IS. I DON'T KNOW HOW THIS HAPPENED.

134
00:11:05,416 --> 00:11:07,168
OBVIOUSLY THIS WAS
A WELL-PLANNED OPERATION,

135
00:11:07,251 --> 00:11:08,377
SO DON'T BLAME ME.

136
00:11:09,211 --> 00:11:10,504
WE SEARCHED THE ENTIRE ESTATE.

137
00:11:10,921 --> 00:11:12,214
BUT THERE'S NO SIGN OF THEM.

138
00:11:12,423 --> 00:11:13,883
WELL, KEEP LOOKING!

139
00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:17,970
IT WOULD SEEM THEY HAD
SOME INSIDE KNOWLEDGE OF ZAOFU.

140
00:11:18,637 --> 00:11:20,472
THEY MUST HAVE BEEN
WORKING WITH SOMEONE.

141
00:11:22,516 --> 00:11:23,809
THE...THE GUARDS.

142
00:11:24,185 --> 00:11:25,519
IT HAD TO BE ONE OF THEM.

143
00:11:25,769 --> 00:11:27,771
- I AGREE.
- QUESTION THEM ALL!

144
00:11:27,938 --> 00:11:30,983
WHOEVER BETRAYED MY CITY
WILL SUFFER THE CONSEQUENCES!

145
00:11:35,696 --> 00:11:37,323
WHAT IS YOUR FULL NAME?

146
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:39,783
WHERE WERE YOU LAST NIGHT?

147
00:11:40,618 --> 00:11:41,827
DO YOU HAVE ANY KNOWLEDGE

148
00:11:41,911 --> 00:11:43,954
OF THE PEOPLE WHO TRIED
TO KIDNAP THE AVATAR?

149
00:11:44,288 --> 00:11:45,706
MY NAME IS XU GUAN.

150
00:11:46,123 --> 00:11:48,792
I WAS PATROLLING THE SOUTH
WALL OF THE BEIFONG ESTATES.

151
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:50,336
I HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO KNOWLEDGE

152
00:11:50,419 --> 00:11:52,463
OF THE PEOPLE
THAT TRIED TO KIDNAP KORRA.

153
00:11:57,468 --> 00:12:00,012
WHAT WAS I DOING LAST NIGHT?
SAME THING I ALWAYS DO.

154
00:12:00,095 --> 00:12:02,473
FROM 9:00 TO 10:00,
I CHECKED MY BODY FOR TICKS.

155
00:12:02,556 --> 00:12:04,725
LYME DISEASE IS A SERIOUS KILLER.

156
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:07,061
THEN I DID MY NIGHTLY
VARRI-CALISTHENICS

157
00:12:07,144 --> 00:12:09,230
FOLLOWED BY 30 MINUTES
OF BREATH HOLDING.

158
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:11,440
I FILMED THE WHOLE THING
IF YOU WANT TO WATCH IT.

159
00:12:11,899 --> 00:12:13,817
THAT WON'T BE NECESSARY.

160
00:12:17,655 --> 00:12:19,615
MAYBE IT WASN'T A GUARD AFTER ALL.

161
00:12:19,823 --> 00:12:22,326
MAYBE IT WAS SOMEONE A LITTLE
HIGHER UP THE FOOD CHAIN.

162
00:12:22,576 --> 00:12:24,828
AIWEI, WHY DON'T YOU QUESTION SU?

163
00:12:24,995 --> 00:12:27,373
LIN, STOP.
YOUR SISTER WASN'T INVOLVED.

164
00:12:27,539 --> 00:12:29,541
NO, I'LL GLADLY BE QUESTIONED.

165
00:12:29,667 --> 00:12:31,001
I HAVE NOTHING TO HIDE.

166
00:12:34,255 --> 00:12:35,798
WHAT IS YOUR FULL NAME?

167
00:12:35,923 --> 00:12:37,591
SUYIN BEIFONG.

168
00:12:37,883 --> 00:12:40,552
I'M THE DAUGHTER OF TOPH
AND THE ONLY SISTER TO LIN,

169
00:12:40,678 --> 00:12:43,097
AND I HAD NOTHING TO DO
WITH THE ATTACK LAST NIGHT.

170
00:12:44,306 --> 00:12:45,599
- SHE IS TELLING THE TRUTH.
- ARGH!

171
00:12:45,849 --> 00:12:48,644
THIS IS A WASTE OF TIME.
JUST BRING IN THE NEXT GUARD.

172
00:12:52,106 --> 00:12:54,817
GIVE ME YOUR NAME
AND TELL ME WHERE YOU ARE FROM.

173
00:12:54,942 --> 00:12:57,820
I'M HONG LI.
I WAS BORN AND RAISED HERE IN ZAOFU.

174
00:12:58,070 --> 00:12:59,530
DO YOU HAVE ANY KNOWLEDGE

175
00:12:59,613 --> 00:13:02,032
OF THE PEOPLE WHO TRIED
TO KIDNAP THE AVATAR?

176
00:13:02,491 --> 00:13:03,534
NO.

177
00:13:06,036 --> 00:13:09,498
DID YOU HELP THE ATTACKERS
ENTER ZAOFU LAST NIGHT?

178
00:13:09,581 --> 00:13:10,749
NO, OF COURSE NOT.

179
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:13,002
YOU'RE LYING.

180
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:14,837
WHAT? NO, I'M NOT!

181
00:13:15,379 --> 00:13:18,048
HOW DID THEY GET IN AND OUT?
WHERE ARE THEY NOW?

182
00:13:18,257 --> 00:13:19,633
I DON'T KNOW!
I'M TELLING YOU,

183
00:13:19,717 --> 00:13:20,801
I DIDN'T HELP THEM.

184
00:13:20,884 --> 00:13:23,012
YOU'RE A TRAITOR TO THE ENTIRE CLAN.

185
00:13:23,387 --> 00:13:25,514
I SUGGEST WE SEARCH HIS PLACE.

186
00:13:42,406 --> 00:13:43,490
I GOT SOMETHING.

187
00:13:43,574 --> 00:13:44,616
WHAT?

188
00:13:45,367 --> 00:13:46,910
IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S FROM THEM.

189
00:13:47,119 --> 00:13:49,705
"TEAM ASSEMBLED.
READY TO RENDEZVOUS."

190
00:13:50,164 --> 00:13:51,248
AND LOOK AT THIS.

191
00:13:53,292 --> 00:13:55,336
THESE ARE THE GUARDS' LOG BOOKS.

192
00:13:55,586 --> 00:13:58,088
ALL THEIR SCHEDULES
AND ROUTES ARE IN HERE.

193
00:13:58,297 --> 00:14:01,342
THAT GUARD KNOWS EVERYTHING.
WE HAVE TO GET HIM TO TALK.

194
00:14:01,425 --> 00:14:03,552
LET'S GO CONFRONT HIM
WITH THIS EVIDENCE RIGHT NOW.

195
00:14:03,635 --> 00:14:04,678
NO.

196
00:14:04,928 --> 00:14:07,806
LET'S GIVE HIM A LITTLE TIME
TO SWEAT IT OUT.

197
00:14:08,223 --> 00:14:09,808
HE WILL TALK EVENTUALLY.

198
00:14:14,146 --> 00:14:15,272
Makc: I DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHY WE'RE NOT TALKING

199
00:14:15,356 --> 00:14:16,940
TO THAT GUARD RIGHT NOW.

200
00:14:17,775 --> 00:14:20,611
EVERY MINUTE WE WASTE HERE,
THOSE GUYS GET FURTHER AWAY.

201
00:14:21,278 --> 00:14:23,238
I MEAN, HOW DOES A RANDOM GUARD

202
00:14:23,322 --> 00:14:25,616
GET INVOLVED WITH A GROUP
OF SUPER CRIMINALS, ANYWAY?

203
00:14:25,699 --> 00:14:26,700
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

204
00:14:26,784 --> 00:14:28,744
THAT GUARD IS ONLY 18 YEARS OLD,

205
00:14:28,827 --> 00:14:31,080
AND HAS LIVED IN ZAOFU HIS ENTIRE LIFE.

206
00:14:31,288 --> 00:14:32,873
ZAHEER AND HIS GANG
HAVE BEEN IN PRISON

207
00:14:32,956 --> 00:14:34,625
FOR MORE THAN 13 YEARS.

208
00:14:34,792 --> 00:14:36,960
I DON'T KNOW,
BUT WE ALL SAW THE EVIDENCE.

209
00:14:37,127 --> 00:14:38,379
IT'S PRETTY OVERWHELMING.

210
00:14:38,462 --> 00:14:40,297
MAYBE A LITTLE TOO OVERWHELMING?

211
00:14:40,631 --> 00:14:42,841
HEY, VARRICK.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

212
00:14:43,467 --> 00:14:45,719
COLLECTING PUMICE STONES WITH ZHU-LI.

213
00:14:45,803 --> 00:14:47,596
THAT LAVABENDER DID A LOT OF DAMAGE.

214
00:14:47,679 --> 00:14:50,307
BUT HE MAKES A NICE EXFOLIATING ROCK.

215
00:14:50,432 --> 00:14:52,059
AND WHEN YOU GOT CALLUSES LIKE MINE,

216
00:14:52,142 --> 00:14:54,728
YOU TAKE ALL THE PUMICE STONES
YOU CAN GET YOUR HANDS ON.

217
00:14:54,812 --> 00:14:57,106
OR IN MY CASE, FEET!

218
00:14:57,981 --> 00:14:59,650
All: EHH...

219
00:15:00,692 --> 00:15:02,486
WHAT WERE YOU SAYING
ABOUT THE EVIDENCE?

220
00:15:02,611 --> 00:15:06,323
I WAS SAYING THAT I CAN SMELL
A CONSPIRACY WHEN I SEE ONE.

221
00:15:06,615 --> 00:15:08,575
LOOK, IF I WAS TRYING
TO SET SOMEONE UP,

222
00:15:08,659 --> 00:15:10,035
I WOULD TELL EVERYONE HE'S GUILTY,

223
00:15:10,119 --> 00:15:12,496
AND THEN PLANT THE EVIDENCE
IN HIS APARTMENT AS PROOF.

224
00:15:13,330 --> 00:15:15,666
OH. YOU MEAN EXACTLY LIKE
WHAT YOU DID TO ME?

225
00:15:16,083 --> 00:15:19,044
YES! JUST LIKE THAT.
REMEMBER HOW GREAT THAT WORKED?

226
00:15:20,212 --> 00:15:22,131
WELL, NOT FOR YOU.

227
00:15:22,256 --> 00:15:23,340
YOU'RE RIGHT.

228
00:15:23,507 --> 00:15:25,509
ALL THE EVIDENCE POINTS TO THIS GUARD,

229
00:15:25,676 --> 00:15:27,261
BUT MAYBE HE'S JUST THE FALL GUY.

230
00:15:27,344 --> 00:15:28,345
BUT FOR WHO?

231
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:30,472
FOR THE ONLY PERSON
WHO CAN TRULY KEEP A SECRET

232
00:15:30,556 --> 00:15:32,307
IN THIS CITY, AIWEI.

233
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:47,698
HE'S NOT HOME. OR HE'S HIDING IN THERE.

234
00:15:47,781 --> 00:15:50,117
OR HE'S INVISIBLE.

235
00:15:52,202 --> 00:15:53,245
PROBABLY JUST NOT HOME.

236
00:15:53,537 --> 00:15:55,247
WE HAVE TO GET IN THERE
AND FIND SOME EVIDENCE

237
00:15:55,330 --> 00:15:58,792
THAT LINKS AIWEI TO ZAHEER,
OTHERWISE SU WON'T BELIEVE US.

238
00:16:06,049 --> 00:16:07,676
IT'S JUST AN EMPTY BOOK.

239
00:16:17,102 --> 00:16:19,271
OH, IT'S LIKE A DESERT ON A JAR.

240
00:16:19,396 --> 00:16:20,898
BOLIN, PUT THAT BACK.

241
00:16:21,106 --> 00:16:22,816
WE DON'T WANT AIWEI TO KNOW
WE WERE IN HERE

242
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:24,109
IF WE CAN'T FIND ANYTHING.

243
00:16:25,068 --> 00:16:26,528
UH...

244
00:16:26,612 --> 00:16:28,739
YOU FORGOT WHERE IT GOES, DIDN'T YOU?

245
00:16:33,243 --> 00:16:34,828
LOOK AT THESE SCUFF MARKS.

246
00:16:34,953 --> 00:16:37,331
I THINK THIS BOOKSHELF SLIDES OPEN.

247
00:16:46,590 --> 00:16:47,799
Korra: WHAT DO YOU THINK
IS DOWN THERE?

248
00:16:47,925 --> 00:16:49,218
COULD BE A STORAGE CELLAR.

249
00:16:49,301 --> 00:16:52,054
OR IT COULD BE
HOW ZAHEER GOT IN AND OUT.

250
00:16:52,262 --> 00:16:54,056
Asami: AIWEI'S COMING BACK. QUICK!

251
00:17:01,063 --> 00:17:03,106
WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN MY HOUSE?

252
00:17:07,778 --> 00:17:09,196
YOU ARE TRESPASSING ON THE PROPERTY

253
00:17:09,279 --> 00:17:11,782
OF ONE OF THE HIGHEST-RANKED
OFFICIALS IN THE CITY.

254
00:17:12,115 --> 00:17:13,951
YOU HAD BETTER HAVE
A GOOD EXPLANATION.

255
00:17:14,243 --> 00:17:15,285
WE DO, WE DO.

256
00:17:15,369 --> 00:17:17,037
WE ACTUALLY KNOCKED
ON YOUR FRONT DOOR,

257
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:18,705
AND WE THOUGHT WE HEARD YOU SAY...

258
00:17:18,789 --> 00:17:21,792
"COME IN! I'M IN THE BATHROOM!"

259
00:17:23,502 --> 00:17:24,878
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHY I'M SAYING THAT.

260
00:17:24,962 --> 00:17:27,256
YOU KNOW I'M LYING.
AND YOU DON'T EVEN SOUND LIKE THAT.

261
00:17:27,631 --> 00:17:29,758
WE CAME HERE BECAUSE THINGS
WEREN'T ADDING UP,

262
00:17:29,841 --> 00:17:32,010
AND WE THOUGHT YOU MIGHT
HAVE SOME ANSWERS.

263
00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:34,054
SIT.

264
00:17:34,346 --> 00:17:37,391
IF YOU WANT TO TALK,
LET'S TALK OVER SOME TEA.

265
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:46,400
SO, WHAT IS NOT ADDING UP, EXACTLY?

266
00:17:47,109 --> 00:17:49,027
HONG LI WAS CLEARLY LYING,

267
00:17:49,152 --> 00:17:51,321
AND WE FOUND EVIDENCE
IN HIS APARTMENT.

268
00:17:51,989 --> 00:17:54,366
BUT DON'T YOU THINK
IT'S WEIRD HOW YOUNG HE IS?

269
00:17:54,616 --> 00:17:56,493
HOW DID HE EVER GET
MIXED UP WITH THIS GROUP?

270
00:17:56,827 --> 00:18:00,038
PERHAPS THROUGH A RELATIVE.
OR MAYBE HE WAS BRIBED.

271
00:18:00,664 --> 00:18:02,916
WE WILL FIND OUT
THOSE ANSWERS IN TIME.

272
00:18:03,917 --> 00:18:07,504
BUT IF IT WASN'T HIM,
WHO DO YOU THINK IT WAS?

273
00:18:10,132 --> 00:18:11,341
WE DON'T KNOW.

274
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,510
YOU DON'T THINK I HAD SOMETHING

275
00:18:13,594 --> 00:18:15,012
TO DO WITH THIS, DO YOU?

276
00:18:16,513 --> 00:18:18,307
WE'RE JUST LOOKING FOR ANSWERS.

277
00:18:19,016 --> 00:18:21,476
AND YOU THINK
YOU FOUND SOMETHING, DON'T YOU?

278
00:18:25,022 --> 00:18:28,942
YOU HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT IS COMING FOR YOU, AVATAR.

279
00:18:36,533 --> 00:18:38,118
COME ON! HE'S GETTING AWAY!

280
00:18:38,201 --> 00:18:40,704
I'M STILL A LITTLE NEW AT THIS,
SO BACK OFF!

281
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:11,068
ARGH!

282
00:19:16,406 --> 00:19:17,783
- HE'S GONE.
- LOOK.

283
00:19:18,742 --> 00:19:20,118
HE MUST'VE ESCAPED THROUGH THERE.

284
00:19:20,243 --> 00:19:21,453
HELP ME CLEAR IT OUT.

285
00:19:24,581 --> 00:19:25,624
Lin: WHAT HAPPENED?

286
00:19:25,832 --> 00:19:27,918
- WE HEARD AN EXPLOSION.
- WHERE IS AIWEI?

287
00:19:28,168 --> 00:19:30,587
YOUR TRUSTED ADVISOR
WAS THE ONE WHO BETRAYED US.

288
00:19:30,921 --> 00:19:33,256
- HE WAS LYING ABOUT THE GUARD.
- WHAT?

289
00:19:33,799 --> 00:19:34,800
NO.

290
00:19:35,008 --> 00:19:37,219
WE CONFRONTED HIM
AND HE BOLTED THROUGH HERE.

291
00:19:42,599 --> 00:19:44,768
HE MUST HAVE COLLAPSED
THE TUNNEL BEHIND HIM.

292
00:19:45,102 --> 00:19:47,312
AND HE RIGGED AN EXPLOSION
TO DESTROY ANY EVIDENCE

293
00:19:47,396 --> 00:19:48,689
THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN HERE.

294
00:19:48,939 --> 00:19:50,774
THIS IS WHERE ZAHEER GOT IN AND OUT.

295
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:52,776
AIWEI WAS THE TRAITOR.

296
00:19:53,527 --> 00:19:54,736
I...

297
00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:56,279
TRUSTED HIM.

298
00:19:57,155 --> 00:19:59,241
- IS EVERYONE OKAY?
- AIWEI IS A FUGITIVE.

299
00:19:59,616 --> 00:20:01,910
GET ALL AVAILABLE GUARDS
TO SEARCH THE MOUNTAINSIDE.

300
00:20:02,035 --> 00:20:04,454
AND FIND OUT WHERE
THIS TUNNEL EXITS IMMEDIATELY!

301
00:20:16,007 --> 00:20:17,050
WHAT DID YOU FIND?

302
00:20:17,134 --> 00:20:18,301
WE LOCATED THE END OF THE TUNNEL,

303
00:20:18,385 --> 00:20:19,720
BUT THERE'S NO SIGN OF HIM.

304
00:20:19,803 --> 00:20:21,263
JUST SOME FRESH TIRE TRACKS.

305
00:20:21,346 --> 00:20:23,807
HE HAD AN ESCAPE PLAN
ALL READY TO GO.

306
00:20:24,015 --> 00:20:25,809
Su: I TRUSTED HIM WITH MY LIFE.

307
00:20:26,226 --> 00:20:29,104
I THOUGHT WE WERE FAMILY,
BUT IT WAS ALL A LIE.

308
00:20:29,771 --> 00:20:31,523
WHOEVER THESE GUYS ARE,

309
00:20:31,606 --> 00:20:33,275
THEY'RE MORE POWERFUL
THAN WE THOUGHT.

310
00:20:33,692 --> 00:20:34,943
AND MORE DANGEROUS.

311
00:20:35,026 --> 00:20:36,570
THAT'S WHY WE HAVE TO FIND THEM.

312
00:20:36,903 --> 00:20:38,613
WE'RE GOING TO HOLD OFF
OUR SEARCH FOR AIRBENDERS

313
00:20:38,697 --> 00:20:39,906
AND HUNT DOWN AIWEI.

314
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:41,408
NAGA CAN TRACK HIS SCENT.

315
00:20:41,533 --> 00:20:43,910
AND I BET IF WE FIND AIWEI
WE'LL FIND ZAHEER.

316
00:20:43,994 --> 00:20:45,036
Lin: NO.

317
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,580
WE'RE NOT HUNTING THIS GROUP.

318
00:20:46,705 --> 00:20:47,998
THERE COULD BE OTHER SECRET AGENTS

319
00:20:48,081 --> 00:20:50,167
IN OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD
LOOKING FOR YOU RIGHT NOW.

320
00:20:50,417 --> 00:20:52,794
I'M TAKING YOU BACK TO REPUBLIC CITY
WHERE I CAN PROTECT YOU.

321
00:20:53,003 --> 00:20:55,338
IF I WASN'T SAFE HERE,
THEN I'M NOT SAFE ANYWHERE.

322
00:20:55,505 --> 00:20:56,506
I HAVE TO STOP THEM.

323
00:20:56,673 --> 00:20:58,675
IT'S TOO DANGEROUS.
YOU ARE NOT GOING!

324
00:20:58,759 --> 00:21:01,845
STOP TRYING TO PROTECT ME.
I'M THE AVATAR. THIS IS MY JOB!

325
00:21:01,928 --> 00:21:03,513
DON'T LECTURE ME ABOUT JOBS!

326
00:21:03,638 --> 00:21:05,974
ENOUGH. KORRA, LISTEN TO LIN.

327
00:21:06,308 --> 00:21:08,059
BUT THEY...

328
00:21:08,226 --> 00:21:10,854
PLEASE. LIN'S ONLY
LOOKING OUT FOR YOU.

329
00:21:11,188 --> 00:21:13,774
I PROMISE YOU AIWEI
AND EVERYONE HE'S WORKING WITH

330
00:21:13,857 --> 00:21:15,525
WILL BE BROUGHT TO JUSTICE.

331
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:19,237
FINE. IF YOU REALLY THINK IT'S BEST.

332
00:21:19,488 --> 00:21:20,530
I DO.

333
00:21:20,655 --> 00:21:21,782
THANK YOU, SU.

334
00:21:22,032 --> 00:21:23,784
EVERYONE SHOULD
GET SOME REST TONIGHT.

335
00:21:24,367 --> 00:21:25,702
I'LL HAVE MY PEOPLE PREP YOUR AIRSHIP

336
00:21:25,786 --> 00:21:27,579
AND YOU CAN LEAVE
FIRST THING IN THE MORNING.

337
00:21:38,173 --> 00:21:39,132
SU.

338
00:21:39,216 --> 00:21:41,134
YOU REALLY THINK
NAGA COULD TRACK AIWEI?

339
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:42,928
- DEFINITELY.
- THEN HERE.

340
00:21:43,303 --> 00:21:45,597
THERE'S A JEEP PACKED
WITH SUPPLIES BY THE EAST GATE.

341
00:21:45,972 --> 00:21:47,682
IT'S ALL GASSED UP AND READY TO GO.

342
00:21:47,766 --> 00:21:49,226
WHAT? WHY?

343
00:21:49,518 --> 00:21:50,894
BECAUSE I WANT YOU
TO HUNT DOWN AIWEI

344
00:21:50,977 --> 00:21:52,229
AND BRING HIM BACK TO ME.

345
00:21:52,521 --> 00:21:53,480
BUT YOU SAID...

346
00:21:53,563 --> 00:21:54,981
