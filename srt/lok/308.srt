00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:28,875
- I AGREE.
- QUESTION THEM ALL!

180
00:11:28,917 --> 00:11:31,542
WHOEVER BETRAYED MY CITY
WILL SUFFER THE CONSEQUENCES!

181
00:11:36,041 --> 00:11:38,583
- WHAT IS YOUR FULL NAME?

182
00:11:38,625 --> 00:11:41,125
WHERE WERE YOU LAST NIGHT?

183
00:11:41,166 --> 00:11:43,083
DO YOU HAVE ANY KNOWLEDGE

184
00:11:43,125 --> 00:11:44,917
OF THE PEOPLE WHO TRIED
TO KIDNAP THE AVATAR?

185
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:46,917
- MY NAME IS XU GUAN.

186
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:49,917
- I WAS PATROLLING THE SOUTH
WALL OF THE BEIFONG ESTATES.

187
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:51,333
- I HAVE ABSOLUTELY
NO KNOWLEDGE

188
00:11:51,375 --> 00:11:55,625
OF THE PEOPLE
THAT TRIED TO KIDNAP KORRA.

189
00:11:58,291 --> 00:12:00,792
- WHAT WAS I DOING LAST NIGHT?
SAME THING I ALWAYS DO.

190
00:12:00,834 --> 00:12:03,542
FROM 9:00 TO 10:00,
I CHECKED MY BODY FOR TICKS.

191
00:12:03,583 --> 00:12:05,834
LYME DISEASE
IS A SERIOUS KILLER.

192
00:12:05,875 --> 00:12:08,166
THEN I DID MY NIGHTLY
VARRI-CALISTHENICS

193
00:12:08,208 --> 00:12:10,291
FOLLOWED BY 30 MINUTES
OF BREATH HOLDING.

194
00:12:10,333 --> 00:12:12,625
I FILMED THE WHOLE THING
IF YOU WANT TO WATCH IT.

195
00:12:12,667 --> 00:12:15,500
- THAT WON'T BE NECESSARY.

196
00:12:18,583 --> 00:12:20,792
- MAYBE IT WASN'T
A GUARD AFTER ALL.

197
00:12:20,834 --> 00:12:23,542
MAYBE IT WAS SOMEONE A LITTLE
HIGHER UP THE FOOD CHAIN.

198
00:12:23,583 --> 00:12:26,083
AIWEI, WHY DON'T YOU
QUESTION SU?

199
00:12:26,125 --> 00:12:28,542
- LIN, STOP.
YOUR SISTER WASN'T INVOLVED.

200
00:12:28,583 --> 00:12:32,291
- NO, I'LL GLADLY BE QUESTIONED.
I HAVE NOTHING TO HIDE.

201
00:12:34,625 --> 00:12:36,709
- WHAT IS YOUR FULL NAME?

202
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:38,959
- SUYIN BEIFONG.

203
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,667
I'M THE DAUGHTER OF TOPH
AND THE ONLY SISTER TO LIN,

204
00:12:41,709 --> 00:12:44,125
AND I HAD NOTHING TO DO
WITH THE ATTACK LAST NIGHT.

205
00:12:44,166 --> 00:12:46,542
- SHE IS TELLING THE TRUTH.
- ARGH!

206
00:12:46,583 --> 00:12:49,709
THIS IS A WASTE OF TIME.
JUST BRING IN THE NEXT GUARD.

207
00:12:52,917 --> 00:12:55,959
- GIVE ME YOUR NAME
AND TELL ME WHERE YOU ARE FROM.

208
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,834
- I'M HONG LI. I WAS BORN
AND RAISED HERE IN ZAOFU.

209
00:12:58,875 --> 00:13:00,709
- DO YOU HAVE ANY KNOWLEDGE

210
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:03,083
OF THE PEOPLE WHO TRIED
TO KIDNAP THE AVATAR?

211
00:13:03,125 --> 00:13:06,875
- NO.

212
00:13:06,917 --> 00:13:10,583
- DID YOU HELP THE ATTACKERS
ENTER ZAOFU LAST NIGHT?

213
00:13:10,625 --> 00:13:13,083
- NO, OF COURSE NOT.

214
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:14,250
- YOU'RE LYING.

215
00:13:14,291 --> 00:13:16,542
- WHAT? NO, I'M NOT!

216
00:13:16,583 --> 00:13:19,500
- HOW DID THEY GET IN AND OUT?
WHERE ARE THEY NOW?

217
00:13:19,542 --> 00:13:21,917
- I DON'T KNOW! I'M TELLING YOU,
I DIDN'T HELP THEM.

218
00:13:21,959 --> 00:13:24,083
- YOU'RE A TRAITOR
TO THE ENTIRE CLAN.

219
00:13:24,125 --> 00:13:26,917
- I SUGGEST WE SEARCH HIS PLACE.

220
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,375
- I GOT SOMETHING.

221
00:13:44,417 --> 00:13:46,333
- WHAT?

222
00:13:46,375 --> 00:13:48,125
- IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S FROM THEM.

223
00:13:48,166 --> 00:13:50,792
"TEAM ASSEMBLED.
READY TO RENDEZVOUS."

224
00:13:50,834 --> 00:13:54,208
- AND LOOK AT THIS.

225
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:56,542
- THESE ARE THE GUARDS'
LOG BOOKS.

226
00:13:56,583 --> 00:13:59,542
ALL THEIR SCHEDULES
AND ROUTES ARE IN HERE.

227
00:13:59,583 --> 00:14:02,417
- THAT GUARD KNOWS EVERYTHING.
WE HAVE TO GET HIM TO TALK.

228
00:14:02,458 --> 00:14:04,333
- LET'S GO CONFRONT HIM
WITH THIS EVIDENCE RIGHT NOW.

229
00:14:04,375 --> 00:14:06,208
- NO.

230
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:09,250
LET'S GIVE HIM A LITTLE TIME
TO SWEAT IT OUT.

231
00:14:09,291 --> 00:14:14,250
HE WILL TALK EVENTUALLY.

232
00:14:14,291 --> 00:14:16,083
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHY WE'RE NOT

233
00:14:16,125 --> 00:14:18,417
TALKING TO THAT GUARD RIGHT NOW.

234
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:22,041
EVERY MINUTE WE WASTE HERE,
THOSE GUYS GET FURTHER AWAY.

235
00:14:22,083 --> 00:14:24,500
I MEAN, HOW DOES A RANDOM GUARD

236
00:14:24,542 --> 00:14:26,333
GET INVOLVED WITH A GROUP
OF SUPER CRIMINALS, ANYWAY?

237
00:14:26,375 --> 00:14:27,875
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

238
00:14:27,917 --> 00:14:29,917
- THAT GUARD IS ONLY
18 YEARS OLD,

239
00:14:29,959 --> 00:14:32,500
AND HAS LIVED IN ZAOFU
HIS ENTIRE LIFE.

240
00:14:32,542 --> 00:14:35,959
ZAHEER AND HIS GANG HAVE BEEN IN
PRISON FOR MORE THAN 13 YEARS.

241
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,917
- I DON'T KNOW,
BUT WE ALL SAW THE EVIDENCE.

242
00:14:37,959 --> 00:14:39,458
IT'S PRETTY OVERWHELMING.

243
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:40,417
- MAYBE A LITTLE
TOO OVERWHELMING?

244
00:14:40,458 --> 00:14:41,959
[gasping]

245
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,458
- HEY, VARRICK.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

246
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:46,834
- COLLECTING PUMICE STONES
WITH ZHU-LI.

247
00:14:46,875 --> 00:14:48,709
THAT LAVABENDER
DID A LOT OF DAMAGE.

248
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:51,291
BUT HE MAKES A NICE
EXFOLIATING ROCK.

249
00:14:51,333 --> 00:14:53,542
AND WHEN YOU GOT
CALLUSES LIKE MINE,

250
00:14:53,583 --> 00:14:55,959
YOU TAKE ALL THE PUMICE STONES
YOU CAN GET YOUR HANDS ON.

251
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,041
OR IN MY CASE, FEET!
[chuckles]

252
00:14:59,083 --> 00:15:01,500
all: EHH...

253
00:15:01,542 --> 00:15:03,583
- WHAT WERE YOU SAYING
ABOUT THE EVIDENCE?

254
00:15:03,625 --> 00:15:07,583
- I WAS SAYING THAT I CAN SMELL
A CONSPIRACY WHEN I SEE ONE.

255
00:15:07,625 --> 00:15:09,458
LOOK, IF I WAS TRYING
TO SET SOMEONE UP,

256
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:11,375
I WOULD TELL EVERYONE
HE'S GUILTY,

257
00:15:11,417 --> 00:15:14,000
AND THEN PLANT THE EVIDENCE
IN HIS APARTMENT AS PROOF.

258
00:15:14,041 --> 00:15:17,375
- OH. YOU MEAN EXACTLY LIKE
WHAT YOU DID TO ME?

259
00:15:17,417 --> 00:15:21,125
- YES! JUST LIKE THAT.
REMEMBER HOW GREAT THAT WORKED?

260
00:15:21,166 --> 00:15:23,333
WELL, NOT FOR YOU.
[chuckles]

261
00:15:23,375 --> 00:15:24,667
- YOU'RE RIGHT.

262
00:15:24,709 --> 00:15:26,750
ALL THE EVIDENCE
POINTS TO THIS GUARD,

263
00:15:26,792 --> 00:15:28,333
BUT MAYBE HE'S JUST
THE FALL GUY.

264
00:15:28,375 --> 00:15:29,625
- BUT FOR WHO?

265
00:15:29,667 --> 00:15:31,166
- FOR THE ONLY PERSON WHO CAN

266
00:15:31,208 --> 00:15:34,000
TRULY KEEP A SECRET
IN THIS CITY, AIWEI.

267
00:15:45,417 --> 00:15:48,792
- HE'S NOT HOME.
OR HE'S HIDING IN THERE.

268
00:15:48,834 --> 00:15:51,083
[gasps]
OR HE'S INVISIBLE.

269
00:15:52,792 --> 00:15:54,458
- PROBABLY JUST NOT HOME.

270
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:56,625
- WE HAVE TO GET IN THERE
AND FIND SOME EVIDENCE

271
00:15:56,667 --> 00:16:00,166
THAT LINKS AIWEI TO ZAHEER,
OTHERWISE SU WON'T BELIEVE US.

272
00:16:07,041 --> 00:16:09,375
- IT'S JUST AN EMPTY BOOK.

273
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:20,542
- OH, IT'S LIKE
A DESERT ON A JAR.

274
00:16:20,583 --> 00:16:22,250
- BOLIN, PUT THAT BACK.

275
00:16:22,291 --> 00:16:23,875
WE DON'T WANT AIWEI TO KNOW

276
00:16:23,917 --> 00:16:25,375
WE WERE IN HERE
IF WE CAN'T FIND ANYTHING.

277
00:16:25,417 --> 00:16:27,917
- UH...

278
00:16:27,959 --> 00:16:31,417
- YOU FORGOT WHERE IT GOES,
DIDN'T YOU?

279
00:16:34,542 --> 00:16:36,083
LOOK AT THESE SCUFF MARKS.

280
00:16:36,125 --> 00:16:40,333
I THINK THIS BOOKSHELF
SLIDES OPEN.

281
00:16:47,375 --> 00:16:48,959
- WHAT DO YOU THINK
IS DOWN THERE?

282
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,417
- COULD BE A STORAGE CELLAR.

283
00:16:50,458 --> 00:16:53,291
- OR IT COULD BE
HOW ZAHEER GOT IN AND OUT.

284
00:16:53,333 --> 00:16:55,041
- AIWEI'S COMING BACK.
QUICK!

285
00:16:58,250 --> 00:16:59,625
[door opens]

286
00:16:59,667 --> 00:17:01,458
[door closes]

287
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:04,959
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING
IN MY HOUSE?

288
00:17:09,458 --> 00:17:10,959
- YOU ARE TRESPASSING
ON THE PROPERTY

289
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
OF ONE OF THE HIGHEST-RANKED
OFFICIALS IN THE CITY.

290
00:17:13,041 --> 00:17:14,959
YOU HAD BETTER HAVE
A GOOD EXPLANATION.

291
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,458
- WE DO, WE DO.

292
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:17,834
WE ACTUALLY KNOCKED
ON YOUR FRONT DOOR,

293
00:17:17,875 --> 00:17:19,583
AND WE THOUGHT
WE HEARD YOU SAY...

294
00:17:19,625 --> 00:17:23,583
[falsetto]
"COME IN! I'M IN THE BATHROOM!"

295
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:26,000
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHY I'M SAYING THAT.

296
00:17:26,041 --> 00:17:28,208
YOU KNOW I'M LYING. AND YOU
DON'T EVEN SOUND LIKE THAT.

297
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:30,625
- WE CAME HERE BECAUSE THINGS
WEREN'T ADDING UP,

298
00:17:30,667 --> 00:17:32,792
AND WE THOUGHT YOU MIGHT
HAVE SOME ANSWERS.

299
00:17:32,834 --> 00:17:35,041
- SIT.

300
00:17:35,083 --> 00:17:38,333
IF YOU WANT TO TALK,
LET'S TALK OVER SOME TEA.

301
00:17:43,625 --> 00:17:47,375
SO, WHAT IS NOT ADDING UP,
EXACTLY?

302
00:17:47,417 --> 00:17:49,792
HONG LI WAS CLEARLY LYING,

303
00:17:49,834 --> 00:17:52,917
AND WE FOUND EVIDENCE
IN HIS APARTMENT.

304
00:17:52,959 --> 00:17:55,208
- BUT DON'T YOU THINK
IT'S WEIRD HOW YOUNG HE IS?

305
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:57,625
HOW DID HE EVER GET
MIXED UP WITH THIS GROUP?

306
00:17:57,667 --> 00:18:01,166
- PERHAPS THROUGH A RELATIVE.
OR MAYBE HE WAS BRIBED.

307
00:18:01,208 --> 00:18:04,542
WE WILL FIND OUT
THOSE ANSWERS IN TIME.

308
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:08,417
BUT IF IT WASN'T HIM,
WHO DO YOU THINK IT WAS?

309
00:18:10,834 --> 00:18:12,625
- WE DON'T KNOW.

310
00:18:12,667 --> 00:18:14,291
- YOU DON'T THINK
I HAD SOMETHING

311
00:18:14,333 --> 00:18:16,917
TO DO WITH THIS, DO YOU?

312
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:19,625
- WE'RE JUST
LOOKING FOR ANSWERS.

313
00:18:19,667 --> 00:18:22,125
- AND YOU THINK
YOU FOUND SOMETHING, DON'T YOU?

314
00:18:25,875 --> 00:18:29,625
YOU HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT IS COMING FOR YOU, AVATAR.

315
00:18:35,041 --> 00:18:36,834
- [grunts]

316
00:18:36,875 --> 00:18:39,041
- COME ON!
HE'S GETTING AWAY!

317
00:18:39,083 --> 00:18:42,250
- I'M STILL A LITTLE NEW
AT THIS, SO BACK OFF!

318
00:18:42,291 --> 00:18:44,834
[breathes deeply]

319
00:18:44,875 --> 00:18:45,875
[grunts]

320
00:18:48,667 --> 00:18:50,458
[metal screeching]

321
00:19:10,333 --> 00:19:13,041
ARGH!

322
00:19:16,959 --> 00:19:19,500
- HE'S GONE.
- LOOK.

323
00:19:19,542 --> 00:19:20,917
HE MUST'VE ESCAPED
THROUGH THERE.

324
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:25,917
HELP ME CLEAR IT OUT.

325
00:19:25,959 --> 00:19:27,083
- WHAT HAPPENED?

326
00:19:27,125 --> 00:19:29,125
WE HEARD AN EXPLOSION.
- WHERE IS AIWEI?

327
00:19:29,166 --> 00:19:31,709
- YOUR TRUSTED ADVISOR
WAS THE ONE WHO BETRAYED US.

328
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:34,875
HE WAS LYING ABOUT THE GUARD.
- WHAT?

329
00:19:34,917 --> 00:19:36,208
NO.

330
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:38,959
- WE CONFRONTED HIM
AND HE BOLTED THROUGH HERE.

331
00:19:42,875 --> 00:19:45,875
- HE MUST HAVE COLLAPSED
THE TUNNEL BEHIND HIM.

332
00:19:45,917 --> 00:19:48,083
- AND HE RIGGED AN EXPLOSION
TO DESTROY ANY EVIDENCE

333
00:19:48,125 --> 00:19:49,792
THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN HERE.

334
00:19:49,834 --> 00:19:52,250
- THIS IS WHERE ZAHEER
GOT IN AND OUT.

335
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:53,834
AIWEI WAS THE TRAITOR.

336
00:19:53,875 --> 00:19:55,709
- I...

337
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:57,709
TRUSTED HIM.

338
00:19:57,750 --> 00:20:00,291
- IS EVERYONE OKAY?
- AIWEI IS A FUGITIVE.

339
00:20:00,333 --> 00:20:03,041
GET ALL AVAILABLE GUARDS
TO SEARCH THE MOUNTAINSIDE.

340
00:20:03,083 --> 00:20:05,500
AND FIND OUT WHERE
THIS TUNNEL EXITS IMMEDIATELY!

341
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:17,959
WHAT DID YOU FIND?

342
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,375
- WE LOCATED
THE END OF THE TUNNEL,

343
00:20:19,417 --> 00:20:20,583
BUT THERE'S NO SIGN OF HIM.

344
00:20:20,625 --> 00:20:22,291
JUST SOME FRESH TIRE TRACKS.

345
00:20:22,333 --> 00:20:24,709
- HE HAD AN ESCAPE PLAN
