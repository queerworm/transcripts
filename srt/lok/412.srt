1
00:00:06,499 --> 00:00:07,499
Earth.

2
00:00:08,499 --> 00:00:09,498
Fire.

3
00:00:09,499 --> 00:00:11,498
Air.

4
00:00:11,499 --> 00:00:13,498
Water.

5
00:00:13,499 --> 00:00:17,498
Only the Avatar can
master all four elements

6
00:00:17,499 --> 00:00:21,499
and bring balance to the world.

7
00:00:25,499 --> 00:00:28,498
The Earth Empire has invaded
the United Republic!

8
00:00:28,499 --> 00:00:30,498
After Kuvira demonstrated the power

9
00:00:30,499 --> 00:00:32,498
of her spirit energy
weapon, President Raiko

10
00:00:32,499 --> 00:00:34,498
surrendered the city,
but the Avatar refused

11
00:00:34,499 --> 00:00:35,498
to give up without a fight.

12
00:00:35,499 --> 00:00:38,498
Korra held Baatar Jr. hostage,
hoping to force Kuvira

13
00:00:38,499 --> 00:00:40,498
to back down, but the plan failed,

14
00:00:40,499 --> 00:00:42,498
and she fired on team Avatar's hideout.

15
00:00:42,499 --> 00:00:46,499
Can anything or anyone stop
Kuvira and her mecha-giant?

16
00:01:01,999 --> 00:01:03,998
Go ahead. Take your time.

17
00:01:03,999 --> 00:01:05,039
Just bending a giant wall.

18
00:01:05,999 --> 00:01:07,998
Man, we got a lot of people here.

19
00:01:07,999 --> 00:01:08,999
Is that everybody?

20
00:01:26,999 --> 00:01:29,998
Kuvira's heading our way
with a platoon of mecha-suits.

21
00:01:29,999 --> 00:01:30,998
What should we do?

22
00:01:30,999 --> 00:01:32,998
This is my hometown,
and I hate to say it,

23
00:01:32,999 --> 00:01:34,998
but there's no use risking all our lives

24
00:01:34,999 --> 00:01:35,998
to fight that giant thing.

25
00:01:35,999 --> 00:01:36,998
Let her take the city for now.

26
00:01:36,999 --> 00:01:38,998
We'll think of some way to
come back and beat her.

27
00:01:38,999 --> 00:01:41,998
What about all the people who
haven't been evacuated yet?

28
00:01:41,999 --> 00:01:43,998
If Kuvira finds out Wu is with them,

29
00:01:43,999 --> 00:01:45,599
she might fire that spirit cannon at him

30
00:01:45,999 --> 00:01:46,998
and take them all out.

31
00:01:46,999 --> 00:01:48,998
I couldn't stop Kuvira
from taking Zaofu.

32
00:01:48,999 --> 00:01:51,998
I'm not letting her
conquer Republic City.

33
00:01:51,999 --> 00:01:54,334
The world isn't safe as long
as she has that weapon.

34
00:01:54,999 --> 00:01:55,998
I agree.

35
00:01:55,999 --> 00:01:57,998
We take down that giant today.

36
00:01:57,999 --> 00:01:58,998
Lin!

37
00:01:58,999 --> 00:01:59,998
Glad to see you all made it out.

38
00:01:59,999 --> 00:02:01,998
You had me worried.

39
00:02:01,999 --> 00:02:03,998
Well, you benders are gonna
have to fight her alone.

40
00:02:03,999 --> 00:02:06,998
She just blew up our factory
with all our hummingbird suits.

41
00:02:06,999 --> 00:02:08,998
Not all of them.

42
00:02:08,999 --> 00:02:10,998
There are the prototypes
back at my office.

43
00:02:10,999 --> 00:02:12,319
If we can get those ready to fly,

44
00:02:12,999 --> 00:02:14,998
we'll at least be able to
offer a little air support.

45
00:02:14,999 --> 00:02:17,079
Su, you take Baatar Jr.
And the rest of the wounded

46
00:02:17,999 --> 00:02:18,998
back to Asami's office.

47
00:02:18,999 --> 00:02:19,998
Get those suits working
as soon as you can.

48
00:02:19,999 --> 00:02:23,998
The rest of us will just have
to face Kuvira on our own.

49
00:02:28,999 --> 00:02:30,998
Everyone, please settle down.

50
00:02:30,999 --> 00:02:33,998
The trains should be returning
to pick us up soon.

51
00:02:33,999 --> 00:02:35,998
Tell that mecha-jerk to settle down.

52
00:02:35,999 --> 00:02:37,998
She's the one blowing up the whole city!

53
00:02:37,999 --> 00:02:39,998
I hate to be the bearer
of more bad news,

54
00:02:39,999 --> 00:02:43,998
but I just heard on the
radio that Kuvira's army

55
00:02:43,999 --> 00:02:44,998
has destroyed the train tracks.

56
00:02:44,999 --> 00:02:47,998
We're not getting out
of the city by rail.

57
00:02:47,999 --> 00:02:49,999
Everyone, I was just up
on the observation deck

58
00:02:50,999 --> 00:02:52,998
and saw a bunch of mecha-suit
soldiers heading this way!

59
00:02:52,999 --> 00:02:55,998
Oh, great! The giant one wasn't enough?

60
00:02:55,999 --> 00:02:57,167
It's over!

61
00:02:57,999 --> 00:02:58,998
We're all gonna get blown to bits!

62
00:02:58,999 --> 00:02:59,998
Listen, everyone.

63
00:02:59,999 --> 00:03:01,999
I can get us out of here
if you just sit tight.

64
00:03:02,999 --> 00:03:03,998
Can you step off the bench, please?

65
00:03:03,999 --> 00:03:04,998
It's a little crowded up here.

66
00:03:04,999 --> 00:03:06,998
Sure. I'm only the conductor.

67
00:03:06,999 --> 00:03:08,999
No one needs me on the bench.

68
00:03:09,999 --> 00:03:10,998
Just stay calm.

69
00:03:10,999 --> 00:03:12,119
I'll be right back. Come on!

70
00:03:12,999 --> 00:03:14,998
Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Where are you going?

71
00:03:14,999 --> 00:03:15,998
I'm going to get some help.

72
00:03:15,999 --> 00:03:17,998
You think you can handle this unruly mob

73
00:03:17,999 --> 00:03:18,998
for a little while?

74
00:03:18,999 --> 00:03:19,999
I raised Meelo.

75
00:03:20,999 --> 00:03:21,999
I can handle anything.

76
00:03:28,999 --> 00:03:31,999
A paint store? That's it!

77
00:03:32,999 --> 00:03:34,998
What are you doing, Meelo?

78
00:03:34,999 --> 00:03:36,998
I just got an idea how
to beat the giant!

79
00:03:36,999 --> 00:03:41,998
Now everyone, grab some paint
and find me some balloons!

80
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,998
Airbenders approaching.

81
00:04:00,999 --> 00:04:02,998
I see them.

82
00:04:48,999 --> 00:04:50,999
Bombs away!

83
00:05:06,999 --> 00:05:08,999
Clear the glass.

84
00:05:13,999 --> 00:05:14,999
Now!

85
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:20,998
The joints are platinum, too!

86
00:05:20,999 --> 00:05:23,998
We can't metalbend any of it!

87
00:05:23,999 --> 00:05:26,998
You're about to get the
world's largest hot-foot,

88
00:05:26,999 --> 00:05:27,999
metal lady!

89
00:05:46,999 --> 00:05:48,998
Hit it now!

90
00:06:49,999 --> 00:06:50,999
Ah! Ah!

91
00:07:00,999 --> 00:07:02,999
Ah! Uh! Uh!

92
00:07:13,999 --> 00:07:15,998
Opal!

93
00:07:25,999 --> 00:07:27,998
Everyone, retreat.

94
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:29,998
Take the wounded back to Asami's office.

95
00:07:29,999 --> 00:07:30,998
I'll meet you there.

96
00:07:30,999 --> 00:07:32,999
I'm going to see if I can find help.

97
00:07:45,991 --> 00:07:48,991
All right. Let's fire it up again.

98
00:07:59,991 --> 00:08:00,990
I can't stabilize it!

99
00:08:00,991 --> 00:08:02,990
I thought you fixed the hydraulics.

100
00:08:02,991 --> 00:08:04,990
I did!

101
00:08:04,991 --> 00:08:05,991
Twist harder!

102
00:08:07,991 --> 00:08:09,991
Ah-ah-oh!

103
00:08:12,991 --> 00:08:14,990
I hope you have something in here

104
00:08:14,991 --> 00:08:16,990
that can take out a
platoon of mecha-suits.

105
00:08:16,991 --> 00:08:18,990
Kuvira's troops are headed this way!

106
00:08:18,991 --> 00:08:20,990
I know how to take
down some mecha-suits,

107
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:23,990
and it just might take
down that giant, too!

108
00:08:23,991 --> 00:08:26,990
Asami, disconnect anything
electrical in here

109
00:08:26,991 --> 00:08:27,990
until we get back.

110
00:08:27,991 --> 00:08:28,991
Zhu Li, let's go.

111
00:08:34,491 --> 00:08:36,490
Where am I?

112
00:08:36,491 --> 00:08:37,490
Mom?

113
00:08:37,491 --> 00:08:39,490
Just rest, son.

114
00:08:39,491 --> 00:08:40,490
I'm here.

115
00:08:40,491 --> 00:08:43,490
Mom, I'm so sorry.

116
00:08:43,491 --> 00:08:47,490
I betrayed you... The whole family.

117
00:08:47,491 --> 00:08:49,490
I gave my life to Kuvira,

118
00:08:49,491 --> 00:08:51,490
and she just fired that weapon at me.

119
00:08:51,491 --> 00:08:53,490
How could she do that?

120
00:08:53,491 --> 00:08:55,490
I don't know, sweetie.

121
00:08:55,491 --> 00:08:57,490
She's a complicated person.

122
00:08:57,491 --> 00:09:00,490
Wing and wei will never forgive me.

123
00:09:00,491 --> 00:09:01,491
And Opal...

124
00:09:02,491 --> 00:09:04,490
Yeah, they might take
some time to come around,

125
00:09:04,491 --> 00:09:07,491
but we'll work through it as a family.

126
00:09:10,491 --> 00:09:13,490
Do you think this plan
will actually work, sir?

127
00:09:13,491 --> 00:09:15,490
I know I can stop the mecha-suits

128
00:09:15,491 --> 00:09:17,571
with an electromagnetic
pulse, so it stands to reason

129
00:09:18,491 --> 00:09:19,851
that I can stop a giant mecha-suit

130
00:09:20,491 --> 00:09:22,491
with a giant electromagnetic pulse.

131
00:09:25,491 --> 00:09:27,490
Zhu Li, I've been thinking.

132
00:09:27,491 --> 00:09:29,490
You're always thinking, sir.

133
00:09:29,491 --> 00:09:33,490
Yes, but lately, ' I've
been thinking about you.

134
00:09:33,491 --> 00:09:35,490
I know we might not make
it out of this mess,

135
00:09:35,491 --> 00:09:38,490
and I feel like there are some
things I should tell you.

136
00:09:38,491 --> 00:09:39,490
There are?

137
00:09:39,491 --> 00:09:41,490
I remember when I was a boy,

138
00:09:41,491 --> 00:09:43,490
I had an ostrich horse.

139
00:09:43,491 --> 00:09:45,490
Named her Mrs. beaks.

140
00:09:45,491 --> 00:09:46,491
I grew up on a farm.

141
00:09:47,491 --> 00:09:48,490
Did I ever tell you that, Zhu Li?

142
00:09:48,491 --> 00:09:51,490
This was before the circus
people took me away.

143
00:09:51,491 --> 00:09:57,490
Anyway, I loved old Mrs. beaks,
but I took her for granted.

144
00:09:57,491 --> 00:09:59,490
You'll have to finish your story later.

145
00:09:59,491 --> 00:10:01,491
Kuvira's troops are in range.

146
00:10:02,491 --> 00:10:04,491
Okay. I hope this works.

147
00:10:12,491 --> 00:10:17,490
Yes! Dead in their tracks.

148
00:10:17,491 --> 00:10:19,490
Oh, rats.

149
00:10:19,491 --> 00:10:21,490
She's still coming.

150
00:10:21,491 --> 00:10:22,490
Zhu Li, do the thing!

151
00:10:22,491 --> 00:10:25,491
I'm afraid there are
no more things to do.

152
00:10:27,491 --> 00:10:28,490
What was that?

153
00:10:28,491 --> 00:10:29,490
An electromagnetic pulse.

154
00:10:29,491 --> 00:10:32,490
It shut down the mecha-suits,
but our power source is fine.

155
00:10:32,491 --> 00:10:33,490
Locate the source of the pulse.

156
00:10:33,491 --> 00:10:35,490
That must be where Varrick is.

157
00:10:35,491 --> 00:10:38,490
Third and fourth mech platoons,
move in and continue the sweep.

158
00:10:38,491 --> 00:10:41,490
Capture anyone left in this city.

159
00:10:41,491 --> 00:10:43,490
Varrick, how come your electro-thingy

160
00:10:43,491 --> 00:10:45,490
shut down the small
mecha-suits but not the big one?

161
00:10:45,491 --> 00:10:47,491
Because it's powered
with spirit vine energy.

162
00:10:48,491 --> 00:10:49,490
I'm sorry.

163
00:10:49,491 --> 00:10:51,490
I wish I could help you,

164
00:10:51,491 --> 00:10:52,490
but it's unstoppable.

165
00:10:52,491 --> 00:10:55,490
It's not.

166
00:10:55,491 --> 00:10:57,490
Dad?

167
00:10:57,491 --> 00:10:58,731
I got him out of jail to help.

168
00:10:59,491 --> 00:11:00,490
I figured we need all the geniuses

169
00:11:00,491 --> 00:11:02,490
we can get our hands on right now.

170
00:11:02,491 --> 00:11:04,490
If the prison's still standing
after all this is over,

171
00:11:04,491 --> 00:11:05,490
we can throw him back in.

172
00:11:05,491 --> 00:11:07,491
I know what you all must think of me,

173
00:11:08,491 --> 00:11:09,490
but I love Republic City,

174
00:11:09,491 --> 00:11:11,490
and I would do anything to save her.

175
00:11:11,491 --> 00:11:13,490
You think you know how
to defeat this thing?

176
00:11:13,491 --> 00:11:15,490
You must act like an infection:

177
00:11:15,491 --> 00:11:17,491
Break the skin and
attack the vital organs.

178
00:11:18,491 --> 00:11:19,490
Disconnect the heart and the brain,

179
00:11:19,491 --> 00:11:21,490
and this beast cannot live.

180
00:11:21,491 --> 00:11:23,490
But how are we supposed to get inside?

181
00:11:23,491 --> 00:11:27,490
Future industries has plasma
says for cutting platinum.

182
00:11:27,491 --> 00:11:28,851
If we had one on the mecha-suit...

183
00:11:29,491 --> 00:11:31,490
But the saws are way too big.

184
00:11:31,491 --> 00:11:33,490
We'd never get the suits off the ground.

185
00:11:33,491 --> 00:11:35,490
I think I can add an electrical element

186
00:11:35,491 --> 00:11:36,811
to the welding torch on your suit

187
00:11:37,491 --> 00:11:38,811
and convert it into a plasma saw.

188
00:11:39,491 --> 00:11:41,490
Then we'll just have
to land on the giant

189
00:11:41,491 --> 00:11:43,571
and cut open a hole big
enough for someone to get in.

190
00:11:44,491 --> 00:11:45,490
Like a metal mosquito.

191
00:11:45,491 --> 00:11:48,490
You know what happens to
mosquitoes that land on me?

192
00:11:48,491 --> 00:11:49,490
I squash 'em!

193
00:11:49,491 --> 00:11:51,490
We'll have to attack in a swarm

194
00:11:51,491 --> 00:11:53,490
to try to keep you guys safe
in the hummingbird suits.

195
00:11:53,491 --> 00:11:56,490

Who's got another song for us?

201
00:12:09,491 --> 00:12:11,490
We can't just sit around here
singing old airbender songs

202
00:12:11,491 --> 00:12:14,490
until we're all captured or worse.

203
00:12:14,491 --> 00:12:16,490
Should we play the button game?

204
00:12:16,491 --> 00:12:17,491
Who has a button?

205
00:12:26,491 --> 00:12:28,490
Where did these badgermoles come from?

206
00:12:28,491 --> 00:12:30,490
The zoo!

207
00:12:30,491 --> 00:12:32,490
Mako always hated my
singing, but they love it!

208
00:12:32,491 --> 00:12:35,490
Well, what are we supposed
to do with badgermoles?

209
00:12:35,491 --> 00:12:37,490
They're the best earthbenders around!

210
00:12:37,491 --> 00:12:39,490
We can use them to
tunnel out of the city

211
00:12:39,491 --> 00:12:41,490
without Kuvira's troops spotting us!

212
00:12:41,491 --> 00:12:44,490
Are you sure this is the best plan?

213
00:12:44,491 --> 00:12:45,491

Third platoon. No sign of anyone so far.

220
00:13:02,491 --> 00:13:04,490
Fourth platoon. En route
to train station.

221
00:13:04,491 --> 00:13:08,490
I think we found the source
of the electromagnetic pulse:

222
00:13:08,491 --> 00:13:09,490
Future industries tower.

223
00:13:09,491 --> 00:13:11,490
That's the place.

224
00:13:15,491 --> 00:13:17,490
Kuvira is headed our way.

225
00:13:17,491 --> 00:13:19,490
How long will it take to
get the plasma saws ready?

226
00:13:19,491 --> 00:13:21,490
Just a few more minutes.

227
00:13:21,491 --> 00:13:22,490
Get out there as soon as you can.

228
00:13:22,491 --> 00:13:25,490
If you do manage to get inside,
find the engine room.

229
00:13:25,491 --> 00:13:26,731
There are two emergency levers.

230
00:13:27,491 --> 00:13:29,490
If you switch them off at the same time,
you'll cut the power.

231
00:13:29,491 --> 00:13:30,490
Thanks.

232
00:13:30,491 --> 00:13:33,491
We may not be able to beat that thing,
but we can slow it down.

233
00:13:34,491 --> 00:13:35,491
Let's go!

234
00:15:11,118 --> 00:15:12,118

I have to.

253
00:17:01,618 --> 00:17:04,617

273
00:18:18,618 --> 00:18:20,617
Yes?

274
00:18:21,618 --> 00:18:24,617
I have something I need to attach
before we take off.

275
00:18:24,618 --> 00:18:25,618
Attach to what?

276
00:18:26,618 --> 00:18:29,617
I need to attach this
ring to your finger.

277
00:18:29,618 --> 00:18:33,617
Zhu Li moon, will you do the thing

278
00:18:33,618 --> 00:18:35,618
for the rest of our lives?

279
00:18:37,618 --> 00:18:39,617
Yes.

00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:41,618
Yes!

281
00:18:43,618 --> 00:18:46,617
Now, let's go attach these
barely-functional rust buckets

282
00:18:46,618 --> 00:18:49,617
to a giant killer smashing machine!

283
00:18:49,618 --> 00:18:53,618
It's exactly how I always
pictured our engagement.

284
00:19:27,618 --> 00:19:29,617
Aim for that spot in the
middle of the back,

285
00:19:29,618 --> 00:19:31,617
the one I can never reach.

286
00:19:31,618 --> 00:19:32,618
Got it.

287
00:19:47,618 --> 00:19:49,617
Whaa! Let's get out of here.

288
00:19:50,618 --> 00:19:51,617
Wow!

289
00:19:51,618 --> 00:19:53,618
I wish I had that kind of flexibility.

290
00:20:39,618 --> 00:20:40,618
Hang on!

291
00:20:42,618 --> 00:20:45,617
Ah!

292
00:20:56,618 --> 00:20:58,617
I need more power!

293
00:20:58,618 --> 00:20:59,617

294
00:20:59,618 --> 00:21:00,618

295
00:21:12,618 --> 00:21:13,617
We need to get out of here.

296
00:21:13,618 --> 00:21:15,618
Almost there.

297
00:21:19,618 --> 00:21:20,617
We have to go now!

298
00:21:20,618 --> 00:21:23,618
Almost there. Almost there.

299
00:21:29,618 --> 00:21:30,617

00:21:46,618 --> 00:21:49,617

00:21:49,618 --> 00:21:51,245
There's our opening.
