1
00:00:02,712 --> 00:00:04,087
<i>Earth.</i>

2
00:00:05,006 --> 00:00:06,464
<i>Fire.</i>

3
00:00:08,551 --> 00:00:10,010
<i>Air.</i>

4
00:00:11,971 --> 00:00:13,805
Water.

5
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:19,811
<i>When I was a boy,</i>
<i>my father, Avatar Aang,</i>

6
00:00:19,896 --> 00:00:21,980
<i>told me the story</i>
<i>of how he and his friends</i>

7
00:00:21,981 --> 00:00:25,442
<i>heroically ended the Hundred Year war.</i>

8
00:00:25,568 --> 00:00:29,988
<i>Avatar Aang and Fire Lord Zuko</i>
<i>transformed the Fire Nation colonies</i>

9
00:00:29,989 --> 00:00:32,365
<i>into the United Republic of Nations,</i>

10
00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:35,327
<i>a society where benders</i>
<i>and non-benders</i>

11
00:00:35,411 --> 00:00:41,124
<i>from all over the world could live and</i>
<i>thrive together in peace and harmony.</i>

12
00:00:41,751 --> 00:00:45,545
<i>They named the capital of this</i>
<i>great land Republic City.</i>

13
00:00:47,423 --> 00:00:51,593
<i>Avatar Aang accomplished</i>
<i>many remarkable things in his life.</i>

14
00:00:51,677 --> 00:00:55,055
<i>But sadly, his time in this world</i>
<i>came to an end.</i>

15
00:00:55,139 --> 00:01:00,268
<i>And like the cycle of the seasons,</i>
<i>the cycle of the Avatar began anew.</i>

16
00:01:22,291 --> 00:01:25,961
The White Lotus has
honored my family by coming.

17
00:01:26,045 --> 00:01:27,504
Thank you.

18
00:01:30,675 --> 00:01:32,050
Welcome.

19
00:01:33,511 --> 00:01:38,181
We have investigated many claims,
both here and in the Northern Tribe.

20
00:01:38,266 --> 00:01:40,517
All have turned out to be false.

21
00:01:41,143 --> 00:01:44,562
Then you should be happy to know
your search has come to an end.

22
00:01:44,814 --> 00:01:48,024
What makes you so sure
your daughter is the one?

23
00:01:48,693 --> 00:01:50,860
Korra, please come in here.

24
00:01:53,781 --> 00:01:57,492
I'm the Avatar. You got to deal with it.

25
00:02:41,078 --> 00:02:42,662
She's strong.

26
00:02:42,747 --> 00:02:44,622
She lacks restraint.

27
00:03:07,146 --> 00:03:09,147
Hey, why all the doom and gloom,
people?

28
00:03:09,482 --> 00:03:11,024
We should be celebrating!

29
00:03:11,108 --> 00:03:13,193
Three elements down, one to go.

30
00:03:13,277 --> 00:03:15,945
You're getting ahead of yourself
as usual, Korra.

31
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:18,573
We haven't decided if you passed
your firebending test yet.

32
00:03:18,657 --> 00:03:20,018
Ever since you were a little girl,

33
00:03:20,076 --> 00:03:22,202
you've excelled
at the physical side of bending,

34
00:03:22,286 --> 00:03:25,330
but completely ignored
the spiritual side.

35
00:03:25,498 --> 00:03:28,083
The Avatar must master both.

36
00:03:28,167 --> 00:03:31,169
I haven't ignored it,
it just doesn't come as easy to me.

37
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:34,506
But that's why I should start training
with Tenzin immediately.

38
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:36,174
He's Mr. Spiritual.

39
00:03:36,175 --> 00:03:38,635
Do you believe she's ready,
Master Katara?

40
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:44,057
Yes, if anyone can teach her what she
needs to learn, it's Tenzin.

41
00:03:44,141 --> 00:03:45,517
Very well, Korra.

42
00:03:45,601 --> 00:03:48,353
It's time for you to begin
your airbending training.

43
00:03:48,437 --> 00:03:50,772
Yes! Finally!

44
00:03:52,775 --> 00:03:57,195
I mean, thank you all for believing in me.

45
00:04:04,453 --> 00:04:05,787
Naga, you should've seen it.

46
00:04:07,164 --> 00:04:08,748
I kicked some Firebender butt.

47
00:04:08,833 --> 00:04:10,291
And I passed.

48
00:04:10,376 --> 00:04:12,544
Tenzin will be here in a few days.

49
00:04:20,386 --> 00:04:22,554
Just taking Naga out for a stroll.

50
00:04:24,765 --> 00:04:26,891
Don't worry, we're not going far.

51
00:04:39,238 --> 00:04:42,157
Naga, go! Thatta girl!

52
00:04:42,241 --> 00:04:43,825
Go, go, go!

53
00:04:52,918 --> 00:04:54,169
Are we there yet? Are we there yet?

54
00:04:54,253 --> 00:04:55,628
Are we there yet?
It looks like we're there.

55
00:04:55,713 --> 00:04:57,630
I know this. This is very familiar.
Are we here yet?

56
00:04:57,715 --> 00:04:58,840
Are we here yet?

57
00:04:58,924 --> 00:05:00,967
- Please tell me we're here!
- Yes, Ikki.

58
00:05:01,051 --> 00:05:03,261
As I've been telling you
for the last 15 minutes,

59
00:05:03,345 --> 00:05:06,598
we are finally here.

60
00:05:09,143 --> 00:05:10,143
Hello, Mother.

61
00:05:10,311 --> 00:05:13,438
I can't tell you how happy I am
to see you.

62
00:05:13,522 --> 00:05:15,190
Please... Help me.

63
00:05:16,275 --> 00:05:18,276
Unhand me, strange woman!

64
00:05:18,277 --> 00:05:20,111
That's your grandmother, Meelo.

65
00:05:23,782 --> 00:05:26,534
It's so good to see all of you.

66
00:05:26,619 --> 00:05:29,954
Gran-Gran, I've been reading
all about your old adventures,

67
00:05:30,039 --> 00:05:31,456
I've been dying to ask you.

68
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:33,291
What happened to Zuko's mom?

69
00:05:33,417 --> 00:05:36,127
Well, Jinora, it's an incredible tale...

70
00:05:36,212 --> 00:05:38,880
Gran-Gran, you look old.
How old are you?

71
00:05:38,964 --> 00:05:40,673
And why is it so cold in the South Pole?

72
00:05:40,758 --> 00:05:42,638
Can we make a campfire
and all huddle around it,

73
00:05:42,676 --> 00:05:44,302
and tell scary stories
and make snowmen?

74
00:05:44,428 --> 00:05:47,305
And then can you make the snowmen
move with waterbending and chase us?

75
00:05:47,306 --> 00:05:49,807
Wouldn't that be fun? Wouldn't it?

76
00:05:50,309 --> 00:05:53,478
Pema, let me help you.
Careful, now. Careful.

77
00:05:53,562 --> 00:05:57,482
Stop doting on me.
I'm not helpless, I'm just pregnant.

78
00:06:00,528 --> 00:06:02,654
The baby's strong.

79
00:06:02,738 --> 00:06:05,698
I see another Airbender in your future.

80
00:06:06,283 --> 00:06:08,785
All I want is one child like me.

81
00:06:08,869 --> 00:06:13,289
A nice non-bender, who doesn't blast
wind in my face every five seconds.

82
00:06:13,374 --> 00:06:16,334
Mommy, look! I'm a Snowbender!

83
00:06:19,338 --> 00:06:22,715
Were Tenzin and his siblings this crazy
when they were kids?

84
00:06:22,925 --> 00:06:24,592
Kya and Bumi certainly were,

85
00:06:24,677 --> 00:06:28,346
but Tenzin has always
been rather serious.

86
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:30,348
Mother, please.

87
00:06:33,352 --> 00:06:34,352
Korra?

88
00:06:35,646 --> 00:06:37,897
Look at you. So big and strong.

89
00:06:37,982 --> 00:06:39,816
You've grown into quite
the young Avatar.

90
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:44,362
Master Tenzin, I'm so glad you're here.
I can't wait to get started.

91
00:06:44,363 --> 00:06:46,364
Yes, well.

92
00:06:47,366 --> 00:06:49,576
You're going to have to tell her
sooner or later.

93
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:50,868
Wait, tell me what?

94
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:53,371
You're not staying, are you?

95
00:06:54,665 --> 00:06:57,667
I'm afraid not.
We're only visiting for the night.

96
00:06:57,751 --> 00:07:00,461
Then I have to return to Republic City.

97
00:07:00,546 --> 00:07:05,508
But, no, you're supposed to move here.
You're supposed to teach me.

98
00:07:05,884 --> 00:07:07,385
I'm sorry, Korra.

99
00:07:07,386 --> 00:07:10,346
Your airbending training
is going to have to wait.

100
00:07:14,977 --> 00:07:18,062
So how long until you're
ready to teach me airbending?

101
00:07:18,147 --> 00:07:19,522
A week? A month?

102
00:07:19,732 --> 00:07:21,691
It could be much longer.

103
00:07:21,775 --> 00:07:23,276
I don't understand.

104
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,441
Why are you making me wait?

105
00:07:24,653 --> 00:07:28,406
I have a responsibility to Republic City.
I'm one of its leaders.

106
00:07:28,407 --> 00:07:31,326
And the situation there
is very unstable right now.

107
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:34,954
But you also have a responsibility
to teach me.

108
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:38,207
Believe me, I'd be happy
to find another airbending master,

109
00:07:38,292 --> 00:07:39,626
but you're the only one.

110
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:41,085
We're stuck with each other.

111
00:07:41,337 --> 00:07:42,754
I wish there were another way.

112
00:07:42,838 --> 00:07:44,422
Wait, there is!

113
00:07:44,423 --> 00:07:45,798
If you can't stay here,

114
00:07:45,883 --> 00:07:48,384
then I'll go back to Republic City
with you.

115
00:07:48,469 --> 00:07:49,469
It's perfect!

116
00:07:49,887 --> 00:07:51,429
Absolutely not!

117
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:53,348
The city is far too dangerous.

118
00:07:53,432 --> 00:07:56,225
Avatar Aang tasked us
with keeping you safe

119
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:58,353
while you mastered the four elements.

120
00:07:58,437 --> 00:08:01,564
I get that, but I don't think keeping me
locked up in this compound

121
00:08:01,649 --> 00:08:03,691
like a prisoner is what he had in mind.

122
00:08:03,817 --> 00:08:05,902
I know this is difficult to accept,

123
00:08:05,986 --> 00:08:08,446
but it's not the right time
for you to come to the city.

124
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:09,947
Whatever.

125
00:08:14,995 --> 00:08:16,496
Goodbye, Gran-Gran.

126
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:18,581
Oogi, yip yip.

127
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:51,489
Nice night for an escape, isn't it?

128
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,534
I have to leave.

129
00:08:54,618 --> 00:08:57,245
I have to find my own path as the Avatar.

130
00:08:58,497 --> 00:08:59,664
I know you do.

131
00:09:01,542 --> 00:09:04,252
Aang's time has passed.

132
00:09:04,336 --> 00:09:07,630
My brother and many of my friends
are gone.

133
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:11,926
It's time for you and your generation
to take on the responsibility

134
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:15,513
of keeping peace and balance
in the world.

135
00:09:16,098 --> 00:09:19,392
And I think you're going to be
a great Avatar.

136
00:09:19,518 --> 00:09:20,727
Thank you.

137
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:23,187
Goodbye, Korra.

138
00:09:35,659 --> 00:09:37,076
Mom, Dad...

139
00:09:38,704 --> 00:09:40,538
I'll miss you.

140
00:09:40,539 --> 00:09:42,582
We love you so much.

141
00:10:18,577 --> 00:10:19,952
Naga, we're here!

142
00:10:30,589 --> 00:10:32,215
Thanks for the ride!

143
00:10:40,599 --> 00:10:43,226
Wow, look at this place.

144
00:10:43,811 --> 00:10:46,270
I've never seen so many Sato-mobiles.

145
00:10:57,282 --> 00:11:00,493
Air Temple island.
That's where Tenzin lives.

146
00:11:00,619 --> 00:11:02,453
You ready for a little swim, girl?

147
00:11:04,206 --> 00:11:05,581
Okay, okay!

148
00:11:05,749 --> 00:11:08,251
Food first, then Air Temple.

149
00:11:09,127 --> 00:11:11,003
Watch it, Naga! Look out!

150
00:11:14,633 --> 00:11:15,633
Watch where you're going!

151
00:11:16,301 --> 00:11:17,718
Sorry about that. Excuse us.

152
00:11:17,803 --> 00:11:19,637
Coming through. Heads up.

153
00:11:19,638 --> 00:11:21,138
Sorry, we're new in town.

154
00:11:29,439 --> 00:11:30,815
Naga, wait.

155
00:11:33,944 --> 00:11:35,945
We'll take one of everything, please.

156
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:37,655
That'll be 20 yuans.

157
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:40,741
I don't have any money.

158
00:11:40,826 --> 00:11:42,493
Then what good are you to me?

159
00:11:45,372 --> 00:11:47,665
Don't worry, girl. This city's huge.

160
00:11:47,666 --> 00:11:50,668
I bet we can find a place to rustle up
something to eat.

161
00:12:06,768 --> 00:12:10,229
Say, think I can get one of them
tasty-smelling fishies?

162
00:12:12,024 --> 00:12:13,482
Yeah, sure!

163
00:12:16,194 --> 00:12:20,114
So do you live in that bush?

164
00:12:20,198 --> 00:12:23,409
Yes, presently that is
what I do call home.

165
00:12:23,493 --> 00:12:26,787
Took me a while to procure a bush
that beauteous.

166
00:12:26,872 --> 00:12:29,707
This park is quite popular
with all the vagabonds.

167
00:12:29,708 --> 00:12:32,835
So there are a lot of you out here?

168
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:35,504
I thought everyone in this city
was living it up.

169
00:12:37,215 --> 00:12:39,216
You got a lot to learn, newcomer.

170
00:12:39,301 --> 00:12:41,052
Welcome to Republic City!

171
00:12:42,512 --> 00:12:45,723
Hey, you! Stop! You can't fish here!

172
00:12:46,725 --> 00:12:48,601
You best skedaddle!

173
00:12:59,112 --> 00:13:02,698
<i>Are you tired of living under the</i>
<i>tyranny of benders?</i>

174
00:13:02,783 --> 00:13:04,742
<i>Then join the Equalists!</i>

175
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:06,327
<i>For too long,</i>

176
00:13:06,411 --> 00:13:09,747
<i>the bending elite of this city</i>
<i>have forced non-benders</i>

177
00:13:09,748 --> 00:13:12,041
<i>to live as lower-class citizens.</i>

178
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:16,712
<i>Join Amon, and together we will tear</i>
<i>down the bending establishment!</i>

179
00:13:16,797 --> 00:13:18,089
What are you talking about?

180
00:13:18,173 --> 00:13:20,257
Bending is the coolest thing
in the world.

181
00:13:20,342 --> 00:13:23,803
<i>Oh, yeah?</i>
<i>Let me guess, you're a bender.</i>

182
00:13:24,012 --> 00:13:25,471
Yeah, I am.

183
00:13:25,555 --> 00:13:28,432
<i>And I bet you'd just love to</i>
<i>knock me off this platform</i>

184
00:13:28,517 --> 00:13:30,226
<i>with some waterbending, huh?</i>

185
00:13:30,352 --> 00:13:32,561
I'm seriously thinking about it.

186
00:13:32,688 --> 00:13:34,772
<i>This is what's wrong with the city.</i>

187
00:13:34,856 --> 00:13:38,818
<i>Benders like this girl</i>
<i>only use their power to oppress us!</i>

188
00:13:40,779 --> 00:13:41,779
What?

189
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:46,367
I'm not oppressing anyone.
You're oppressing yourself.

190
00:13:46,451 --> 00:13:48,619
<i>That didn't even make sense.</i>

191
00:13:54,876 --> 00:13:56,961
Excuse me, I think I'm lost.

192
00:13:57,212 --> 00:13:59,338
How do I get to Air Temple island
from here?

193
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:01,257
Just head down this street...

194
00:14:03,051 --> 00:14:05,803
You should get moving, young lady.
It isn't safe.

195
00:14:09,808 --> 00:14:13,811
Mr. Chung, please tell me
that you have my money,

196
00:14:13,812 --> 00:14:17,940
or else I can't guarantee
I can protect your fine establishment.

197
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:21,110
I'm sorry.
Business has been slow. Please.

198
00:14:21,194 --> 00:14:22,653
Take one of my phonographs.

199
00:14:25,157 --> 00:14:28,826
My friend here is not a music lover.

200
00:14:28,827 --> 00:14:30,661
Give me the money, or else...

201
00:14:30,746 --> 00:14:32,830
Or else what, hoodlum?

202
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:44,467
Since you're obviously fresh off the boat,

203
00:14:44,551 --> 00:14:46,844
let me explain a couple things.

204
00:14:46,845 --> 00:14:49,597
You're in Triple Threat Triad territory,

205
00:14:49,681 --> 00:14:53,017
and we're about to put you
in the hospital.

206
00:14:53,101 --> 00:14:55,227
You're the only ones who are going
to need a hospital.

207
00:14:55,562 --> 00:14:58,230
And for your sake,
I hope there's one nearby.

208
00:14:58,398 --> 00:14:59,940
Who do you think you are?

209
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:02,318
Why don't you come and find out?

210
00:15:14,456 --> 00:15:16,582
- What just happened?
- Did she just earthbend?

211
00:15:27,594 --> 00:15:30,054
- Can she firebend, too?
- Could she be...

212
00:15:36,686 --> 00:15:39,730
Got an idea about
who I am now, chumps?

213
00:15:44,194 --> 00:15:45,486
Come on!

214
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,365
You're not getting away.

215
00:16:02,921 --> 00:16:05,464
<i>Police! Freeze where you are!</i>

216
00:16:11,763 --> 00:16:13,305
Cool. Metalbenders.

217
00:16:20,939 --> 00:16:23,941
I caught the bad guys for you, Officers.

218
00:16:23,942 --> 00:16:25,276
Arrest them.

219
00:16:29,948 --> 00:16:31,866
You're under arrest, too.

220
00:16:37,956 --> 00:16:39,832
What do you mean I'm under arrest?

221
00:16:39,916 --> 00:16:42,918
Those are the bad guys over there.
They were smashing up a shop.

222
00:16:43,003 --> 00:16:45,838
From the looks of it, you smashed up
a lot more than that.

223
00:16:46,965 --> 00:16:49,341
Wait, you can't arrest me.
Let me explain.

224
00:16:49,426 --> 00:16:52,720
You can explain yourself all you like
down at headquarters.

225
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:05,042
Let’s See.

226
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:09,505
<i>Multiple counts of destruction of private</i>
<i>and city property.</i>

227
00:18:10,048 --> 00:18:12,591
Not to mention evading arrest.

228
00:18:12,676 --> 00:18:15,427
You're in a whole mess of trouble,
young lady.

229
00:18:15,512 --> 00:18:17,832
But there were some thugs
threatening a helpless shopkeeper

230
00:18:17,889 --> 00:18:19,098
- and I had to...
- Can it!

231
00:18:19,182 --> 00:18:22,059
You should have called the police
and stayed out of the way.

232
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:26,897
But I couldn't just sit by and do nothing.
It's my duty to help people.

233
00:18:26,982 --> 00:18:28,857
See, I'm the Avatar.

234
00:18:29,067 --> 00:18:31,610
Oh, I am well aware of who you are.

235
00:18:31,695 --> 00:18:36,448
And your "Avatar' title might impress
some people, but not me."

236
00:18:37,158 --> 00:18:38,492
All right. Fine.

237
00:18:38,576 --> 00:18:41,078
Then I want to talk to
whoever's in charge.

238
00:18:41,079 --> 00:18:44,081
You're talking to her. I'm Chief Beifong.

239
00:18:44,582 --> 00:18:46,417
Wait. Beifong?

240
00:18:46,501 --> 00:18:48,877
Lin Beifong? You're Toph's daughter!

241
00:18:48,962 --> 00:18:49,962
What of it?

242
00:18:50,046 --> 00:18:52,214
Well, then why are you treating me
like a criminal?

243
00:18:52,299 --> 00:18:54,550
Avatar Aang and your mother
were friends.

244
00:18:54,634 --> 00:18:56,093
They saved the world together.

245
00:18:56,094 --> 00:18:57,761
That's ancient history.

246
00:18:57,846 --> 00:19:01,098
And it's got diddly-squat to do
with the mess you're in right now.

247
00:19:01,099 --> 00:19:02,891
You can't just waltz in here

248
00:19:02,976 --> 00:19:05,936
and dole out vigilante justice
like you own the place.

249
00:19:06,813 --> 00:19:09,273
Chief. Councilman Tenzin is here.

250
00:19:10,358 --> 00:19:11,817
Let him in.

251
00:19:14,904 --> 00:19:16,030
Tenzin.

252
00:19:16,114 --> 00:19:20,284
Sorry, I got a little sidetracked
on my way to see you.

253
00:19:23,455 --> 00:19:25,789
Lin, you are looking radiant as usual.

254
00:19:25,874 --> 00:19:27,333
Cut the garbage, Tenzin.

255
00:19:27,417 --> 00:19:29,543
Why is the Avatar in Republic City?

256
00:19:29,627 --> 00:19:31,045
I thought you were supposed to be

257
00:19:31,129 --> 00:19:33,047
moving down to the South Pole
to train her.

258
00:19:33,131 --> 00:19:35,507
My relocation has been delayed.

259
00:19:35,592 --> 00:19:38,135
The Avatar, on the other hand,

260
00:19:38,136 --> 00:19:40,637
will be heading back
to the South Pole immediately.

261
00:19:40,722 --> 00:19:42,681
- Where she will stay put.
- But...

262
00:19:42,766 --> 00:19:44,433
if you would be so kind

263
00:19:44,517 --> 00:19:47,144
as to drop the charges against Korra,

264
00:19:47,145 --> 00:19:50,814
I will take full responsibility
for today's regrettable events

265
00:19:50,899 --> 00:19:53,233
and cover all the damages.

266
00:19:56,154 --> 00:19:59,156
Fine. Get her out of my city.

267
00:19:59,157 --> 00:20:02,159
Always a pleasure, Lin. Let's go, Korra.

268
00:20:11,961 --> 00:20:12,961
Tenzin, please.

269
00:20:13,046 --> 00:20:14,421
Don't send me back home.

270
00:20:14,506 --> 00:20:18,384
You blatantly disobeyed my wishes,
and the Orders of the White Lotus.

271
00:20:18,468 --> 00:20:20,594
Katara agreed with me
that I should come.

272
00:20:20,929 --> 00:20:23,180
She said my destiny is in Republic City.

273
00:20:23,306 --> 00:20:25,224
Don't bring my mother into this!

274
00:20:25,392 --> 00:20:28,435
Look, I can't wait any longer
to finish my training.

275
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:30,321
Being cooped up and hidden away
from the world

276
00:20:30,397 --> 00:20:33,023
isn't helping me become a better Avatar.

277
00:20:33,108 --> 00:20:37,528
I saw a lot of the city today
and it's totally out of whack.

278
00:20:37,612 --> 00:20:39,530
I understand now why you need to stay.

279
00:20:39,614 --> 00:20:41,865
Republic City does need you.

280
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:43,325
But it needs me, too!

281
00:20:47,831 --> 00:20:50,207
Ls this your polar bear-dog, miss?

282
00:21:19,529 --> 00:21:21,572
- Korra!
- Korra!

283
00:21:23,241 --> 00:21:25,242
Are you coming to live with us
on the island?

284
00:21:25,743 --> 00:21:28,162
No, I'm sorry, Ikki.

285
00:21:28,246 --> 00:21:29,580
I have to go home now.

286
00:21:36,421 --> 00:21:37,796
Wait.

287
00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:40,841
I have done my best
to guide Republic City

288
00:21:40,925 --> 00:21:43,260
towards the dream my father had for it.

289
00:21:43,261 --> 00:21:46,930
But you are right, it has fallen
out of balance since he passed.

290
00:21:47,015 --> 00:21:50,559
I thought I should put off your training
in order to uphold his legacy.

291
00:21:50,977 --> 00:21:53,187
But you are his legacy.

292
00:21:54,022 --> 00:21:56,690
You may stay and train
airbending here with me.

293
00:21:56,774 --> 00:21:59,276
Republic City needs its Avatar
once again.

294
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:02,362
Yes! Thank you! You're the best!

295
00:22:19,088 --> 00:22:24,301
<i>Hello? I'm Korra, your new Avatar.</i>

296
00:22:25,178 --> 00:22:26,720
Does this mean you've moved
to Republic City?

297
00:22:26,804 --> 00:22:29,306
Were you trying to send a message
to the Triads yesterday?

298
00:22:29,307 --> 00:22:32,976
Will you be fighting crime or
the anti-bending revolution? Or both?

299
00:22:33,061 --> 00:22:35,479
Will you be working with Chief Beifong
and the police?

300
00:22:36,314 --> 00:22:40,192
<i>Yes, I am definitely here to stay,</i>
<i>but, honestly...</i>

301
00:22:40,276 --> 00:22:42,694
<i>I don't exactly have a plan yet.</i>

302
00:22:42,779 --> 00:22:45,072
<i>See, I'm still in training, but...</i>

303
00:22:45,156 --> 00:22:49,076
<i>Look, all I know is Avatar Aang</i>
<i>meant for this city</i>

304
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:52,746
<i>to be the center of peace</i>
<i>and balance in the world.</i>

305
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:57,334
<i>And I believe we can make</i>
<i>his dream a reality.</i>

306
00:22:57,335 --> 00:23:00,254
<i>I look forward to serving you.</i>

307
00:23:00,338 --> 00:23:04,341
<i>I'm so happy to be here.</i>
<i>Thank you, Republic City.</i>

308
00:23:04,342 --> 00:23:06,385
<i>All right, that's all the questions the...</i>

309
00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:09,763
Amon, how do you want to handle this?

310
00:23:10,265 --> 00:23:12,975
So the Avatar has arrived early.

311
00:23:13,351 --> 00:23:16,353
It looks like we will have to accelerate
our plans.
