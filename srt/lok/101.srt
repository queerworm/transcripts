1
00:00:08,667 --> 00:00:10,291
- EARTH.

2
00:00:10,333 --> 00:00:14,000
FIRE.

3
00:00:14,041 --> 00:00:17,917
AIR.

4
00:00:17,959 --> 00:00:19,959
WATER.

5
00:00:22,333 --> 00:00:23,500
WHEN I WAS A BOY,

6
00:00:23,542 --> 00:00:25,583
MY FATHER,
AVATAR AANG,

7
00:00:25,625 --> 00:00:27,750
TOLD ME THE STORY
OF HOW HE AND HIS FRIENDS

8
00:00:27,792 --> 00:00:31,583
HEROICALLY ENDED
THE HUNDRED-YEAR WAR.

9
00:00:31,625 --> 00:00:33,875
AVATAR AANG
AND FIRE LORD ZUKO

10
00:00:33,917 --> 00:00:35,750
TRANSFORMED
THE FIRE NATION COLONIES

11
00:00:35,792 --> 00:00:38,166
INTO THE UNITED REPUBLIC
OF NATIONS,

12
00:00:38,208 --> 00:00:41,458
A SOCIETY
WHERE BENDERS AND NON-BENDERS

13
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:44,750
FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD
COULD LIVE AND THRIVE TOGETHER

14
00:00:44,792 --> 00:00:47,375
IN PEACE AND HARMONY.

15
00:00:47,417 --> 00:00:53,333
THEY NAMED THE CAPITAL OF
THIS GREAT LAND REPUBLIC CITY.

16
00:00:53,375 --> 00:00:56,208
AVATAR AANG ACCOMPLISHED
MANY REMARKABLE THINGS

17
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:59,959
IN HIS LIFE,
BUT SADLY HIS TIME IN THIS WORLD

18
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,375
CAME TO AN END.

19
00:01:01,417 --> 00:01:03,250
AND, LIKE THE CYCLE
OF THE SEASONS,

20
00:01:03,291 --> 00:01:05,959
THE CYCLE OF THE AVATAR
BEGAN ANEW.

21
00:01:28,291 --> 00:01:31,750
- THE WHITE LOTUS HAS HONORED
MY FAMILY BY COMING.

22
00:01:31,792 --> 00:01:32,792
THANK YOU.

23
00:01:36,625 --> 00:01:39,542
- WELCOME.

24
00:01:39,583 --> 00:01:41,583
- WE HAVE INVESTIGATED
MANY CLAIMS,

25
00:01:41,625 --> 00:01:44,500
BOTH HERE
AND IN THE NORTHERN TRIBE.

26
00:01:44,542 --> 00:01:46,792
ALL HAVE TURNED OUT
TO BE FALSE.

27
00:01:46,834 --> 00:01:48,750
- THEN YOU SHOULD BE HAPPY
TO KNOW

28
00:01:48,792 --> 00:01:50,834
YOUR SEARCH HAS COME
TO AN END.

29
00:01:50,875 --> 00:01:54,083
- WHAT MAKES YOU SO SURE
YOUR DAUGHTER IS THE ONE?

30
00:01:54,125 --> 00:01:55,417
- KORRA.

31
00:01:55,458 --> 00:01:57,458
PLEASE COME IN HERE.

32
00:01:59,875 --> 00:02:04,291
- I'M THE AVATAR.
YOU GOT TO DEAL WITH IT.

33
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:17,667
- [grunts]

34
00:02:24,709 --> 00:02:27,291
- [grunts]

35
00:02:30,375 --> 00:02:32,208
- [yells]

36
00:02:35,959 --> 00:02:36,792
- [groans]

37
00:02:43,125 --> 00:02:44,750
- [grunts]

38
00:02:44,792 --> 00:02:47,083
- [groans]

39
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:48,375
- SHE'S STRONG.

40
00:02:48,417 --> 00:02:51,041
- SHE LACKS RESTRAINT.

41
00:02:57,542 --> 00:02:58,667
- [whimpers]

42
00:03:06,083 --> 00:03:09,625
[groans]

43
00:03:09,667 --> 00:03:11,250
- WHOO-HOO!

44
00:03:13,041 --> 00:03:15,500
HEY, WHY ALL THE DOOM
AND GLOOM, PEOPLE?

45
00:03:15,542 --> 00:03:17,083
WE SHOULD BE CELEBRATING.

46
00:03:17,125 --> 00:03:19,625
THREE ELEMENTS DOWN,
ONE TO GO.

47
00:03:19,667 --> 00:03:22,417
- YOU'RE GETTING AHEAD
OF YOURSELF AS USUAL, KORRA.

48
00:03:22,458 --> 00:03:24,917
WE HAVEN'T DECIDED IF YOU PASSED
YOUR FIREBENDING TEST YET.

49
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:26,333
- EVER SINCE YOU WERE
A LITTLE GIRL,

50
00:03:26,375 --> 00:03:28,500
YOU'VE EXCELLED
AT THE PHYSICAL SIDE OF BENDING

51
00:03:28,542 --> 00:03:31,542
BUT COMPLETELY IGNORED
THE SPIRITUAL SIDE.

52
00:03:31,583 --> 00:03:34,041
THE AVATAR MUST MASTER BOTH.

53
00:03:34,083 --> 00:03:35,583
- I HAVEN'T IGNORED IT.

54
00:03:35,625 --> 00:03:37,333
IT JUST DOESN'T COME
AS EASY TO ME.

55
00:03:37,375 --> 00:03:39,417
BUT THAT'S
WHY I SHOULD START TRAINING

56
00:03:39,458 --> 00:03:40,542
WITH TENZIN IMMEDIATELY.

57
00:03:40,583 --> 00:03:42,166
HE'S MR. SPIRITUAL.

58
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:44,750
- DO YOU BELIEVE
SHE'S READY, MASTER KATARA?

59
00:03:44,792 --> 00:03:46,083
- YES.

60
00:03:46,125 --> 00:03:48,333
IF ANYONE CAN TEACH HER
WHAT SHE NEEDS TO LEARN,

61
00:03:48,375 --> 00:03:50,208
IT'S TENZIN.

62
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:51,500
- VERY WELL, KORRA.

63
00:03:51,542 --> 00:03:53,417
IT'S TIME FOR YOU TO BEGIN

64
00:03:53,458 --> 00:03:54,583
YOUR AIRBENDING TRAINING.

65
00:03:54,625 --> 00:03:55,875
- YES!

66
00:03:55,917 --> 00:03:57,709
FINALLY.

67
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,875
I MEAN...
[clears throat]

68
00:04:00,917 --> 00:04:03,792
THANK YOU ALL
FOR BELIEVING IN ME.

69
00:04:05,208 --> 00:04:07,250
[giggles]

70
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:13,000
NAGA, YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN IT.

71
00:04:13,041 --> 00:04:14,959
I KICKED SOME FIREBENDER BUTT,

72
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,917
AND I PASSED.

73
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:19,250
TENZIN WILL BE HERE
IN A FEW DAYS.

74
00:04:19,291 --> 00:04:20,834
[giggles]

75
00:04:26,583 --> 00:04:28,709
JUST TAKING NAGA OUT
FOR A STROLL.

76
00:04:30,834 --> 00:04:32,792
DON'T WORRY.
WE'RE NOT GOING FAR.

77
00:04:41,375 --> 00:04:45,291
[gentle instrumental music]

78
00:04:45,333 --> 00:04:47,291
NAGA, GO.

79
00:04:47,333 --> 00:04:48,333
THAT A GIRL.

80
00:04:48,375 --> 00:04:51,792
GO, GO, GO.

81
00:04:59,417 --> 00:05:00,875
- ARE WE THERE YET?
ARE WE THERE YET?

82
00:05:00,917 --> 00:05:02,250
ARE WE THERE YET?
IT LOOKS LIKE WE'RE THERE.

83
00:05:02,291 --> 00:05:03,333
I KNOW
THAT THIS IS VERY FAMILIAR.

84
00:05:03,375 --> 00:05:04,709
ARE WE HERE YET?
ARE WE HERE YET? ARE

85
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:06,083
WE HERE YET?
OH, PLEASE TELL ME WE'RE HERE.

86
00:05:06,125 --> 00:05:07,792
- YES, IKKI,
AS I'VE BEEN TELLING YOU

87
00:05:07,834 --> 00:05:09,667
FOR THE LAST 15 MINUTES,

88
00:05:09,709 --> 00:05:12,583
WE ARE FINALLY HERE.

89
00:05:12,625 --> 00:05:14,709
- WHEE!

90
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:16,291
- HELLO, MOTHER.

91
00:05:16,333 --> 00:05:19,500
I CAN'T TELL YOU
HOW HAPPY I AM TO SEE YOU.

92
00:05:19,542 --> 00:05:21,333
PLEASE HELP ME.

93
00:05:21,375 --> 00:05:22,834
- [laughs]

94
00:05:22,875 --> 00:05:24,458
- UNHAND ME, STRANGE WOMAN!

95
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:25,959
- THAT'S YOUR GRANDMOTHER,
MEELO.

96
00:05:29,917 --> 00:05:32,959
- IT'S SO GOOD
TO SEE ALL OF YOU.

97
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,041
- GRAN GRAN, I'VE BEEN READING
ALL ABOUT YOUR OLD ADVENTURES.

98
00:05:36,083 --> 00:05:37,583
I'VE BEEN DYING TO ASK YOU,

99
00:05:37,625 --> 00:05:39,500
WHAT HAPPENED
TO ZUKO'S MOM?

100
00:05:39,542 --> 00:05:42,417
- WELL, JINORA,
IT'S AN INCREDIBLE TALE.

101
00:05:42,458 --> 00:05:45,000
- GRAN GRAN, YOU LOOK OLD.
HOW OLD ARE YOU?

102
00:05:45,041 --> 00:05:46,959
AND WHY IS IT SO COLD
IN THE SOUTH POLE?

103
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
CAN WE MAKE A CAMPFIRE
AND ALL HUDDLE AROUND IT

104
00:05:49,041 --> 00:05:50,583
AND TELL SCARY STORIES
AND MAKE SNOWMEN?

105
00:05:50,625 --> 00:05:52,291
AND THEN CAN WE MAKE
THE SNOWMEN MOVE

106
00:05:52,333 --> 00:05:53,583
WITH WATERBENDING
AND CHASE US?

107
00:05:53,625 --> 00:05:54,875
WOULDN'T THAT BE FUN?

108
00:05:54,917 --> 00:05:56,291
HUH?
WOULDN'T IT?

109
00:05:56,333 --> 00:05:57,834
- PEMA, LET ME HELP YOU.

110
00:05:57,875 --> 00:05:59,250
CAREFUL NOW.
CAREFUL.

111
00:05:59,291 --> 00:06:01,333
- STOP DOTING ON ME.

112
00:06:01,375 --> 00:06:02,375
I'M NOT HELPLESS.

113
00:06:02,417 --> 00:06:05,333
I'M JUST PREGNANT.

114
00:06:06,792 --> 00:06:08,583
- THE BABY'S STRONG.

115
00:06:08,625 --> 00:06:12,375
I SEE ANOTHER AIRBENDER
IN YOUR FUTURE.

116
00:06:12,417 --> 00:06:15,083
- ALL I WANT
IS ONE CHILD LIKE ME,

117
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:17,750
A NICE, NON-BENDER
WHO DOESN'T BLAST WIND

118
00:06:17,792 --> 00:06:19,291
IN MY FACE
EVERY FIVE SECONDS.

119
00:06:19,333 --> 00:06:20,542
- MOMMY, LOOK.

120
00:06:20,583 --> 00:06:22,375
I'M A SNOWBENDER.

121
00:06:25,125 --> 00:06:27,875
- WERE TENZIN AND HIS SIBLINGS
THIS CRAZY

122
00:06:27,917 --> 00:06:28,959
WHEN THEY WERE KIDS?

123
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,917
- KYA AND BUMI
CERTAINLY WERE.

124
00:06:30,959 --> 00:06:34,458
BUT TENZIN HAS ALWAYS BEEN
RATHER SERIOUS.

125
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:37,667
- MOTHER, PLEASE.

126
00:06:39,041 --> 00:06:41,625
KORRA?

127
00:06:41,667 --> 00:06:42,875
LOOK AT YOU,

128
00:06:42,917 --> 00:06:44,333
SO BIG AND STRONG.

129
00:06:44,375 --> 00:06:46,083
YOU'VE GROWN
INTO QUITE THE YOUNG AVATAR.

130
00:06:46,125 --> 00:06:49,000
- MASTER TENZIN,
I'M SO GLAD YOU'RE HERE.

131
00:06:49,041 --> 00:06:50,417
I CAN'T WAIT
TO GET STARTED.

132
00:06:50,458 --> 00:06:53,542
- YES, WELL...

133
00:06:53,583 --> 00:06:55,750
- YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE
TO TELL HER SOONER OR LATER.

134
00:06:55,792 --> 00:06:56,875
- WAIT, TELL ME WHAT?

135
00:06:56,917 --> 00:06:59,417
- YOU'RE NOT STAYING,
ARE YOU?

136
00:06:59,458 --> 00:07:01,959
- I'M AFRAID NOT.

137
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,041
WE'RE ONLY VISITING
FOR THE NIGHT.

138
00:07:04,083 --> 00:07:06,917
THEN I HAVE TO RETURN
TO REPUBLIC CITY.

139
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:10,375
- BUT, NO, YOU'RE SUPPOSED
TO MOVE HERE.

140
00:07:10,417 --> 00:07:11,750
YOU'RE SUPPOSED
TO TEACH ME.

141
00:07:11,792 --> 00:07:13,583
- I'M SORRY, KORRA.

142
00:07:13,625 --> 00:07:15,834
YOUR AIRBENDING TRAINING
IS GOING TO HAVE TO WAIT.

143
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:22,000
- SO HOW LONG UNTIL YOU'RE READY
TO TEACH ME AIRBENDING?

144
00:07:22,041 --> 00:07:23,417
A WEEK?
A MONTH?

145
00:07:23,458 --> 00:07:25,750
- IT COULD BE MUCH LONGER.

146
00:07:25,792 --> 00:07:27,250
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

147
00:07:27,291 --> 00:07:28,667
WHY ARE YOU MAKING ME WAIT?

148
00:07:28,709 --> 00:07:30,959
- I HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY
TO REPUBLIC CITY.

149
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,750
I'M ONE OF ITS LEADERS,

150
00:07:32,792 --> 00:07:35,375
AND THE SITUATION THERE
IS VERY UNSTABLE RIGHT NOW.

151
00:07:35,417 --> 00:07:38,834
- BUT YOU ALSO HAVE
A RESPONSIBILITY TO TEACH ME.

152
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:41,917
BELIEVE ME, I'D BE HAPPY TO FIND
ANOTHER AIRBENDING MASTER,

153
00:07:41,959 --> 00:07:43,959
BUT YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE.

154
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,166
WE'RE STUCK WITH EACH OTHER.

155
00:07:45,208 --> 00:07:46,709
- I WISH THERE WERE ANOTHER WAY.

156
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:48,250
- WAIT.
THERE IS.

157
00:07:48,291 --> 00:07:50,875
IF YOU CAN'T STAY HERE,
THEN I'LL GO BACK

158
00:07:50,917 --> 00:07:52,333
TO REPUBLIC CITY
WITH YOU.

159
00:07:52,375 --> 00:07:53,333
IT'S PERFECT.

160
00:07:53,375 --> 00:07:55,625
- ABSOLUTELY NOT.

161
00:07:55,667 --> 00:07:57,083
THE CITY IS FAR TOO DANGEROUS.

162
00:07:57,125 --> 00:08:00,291
AVATAR AANG TASKED US
WITH KEEPING YOU SAFE

163
00:08:00,333 --> 00:08:02,375
WHILE YOU MASTERED
THE FOUR ELEMENTS.

164
00:08:02,417 --> 00:08:05,000
- I GET THAT, BUT I DON'T THINK
KEEPING ME LOCKED UP

165
00:08:05,041 --> 00:08:06,500
IN THIS COMPOUND
LIKE A PRISONER

166
00:08:06,542 --> 00:08:08,000
IS WHAT HE HAD IN MIND.

167
00:08:08,041 --> 00:08:09,875
- I KNOW THIS IS DIFFICULT
TO ACCEPT,

168
00:08:09,917 --> 00:08:12,583
BUT IT'S NOT THE RIGHT TIME
FOR YOU TO COME TO THE CITY.

169
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:14,291
- WHATEVER.

170
00:08:17,417 --> 00:08:18,834
[door slams]

171
00:08:18,875 --> 00:08:20,750
- GOOD-BYE, GRAN GRAN.

172
00:08:20,792 --> 00:08:23,083
- OOGI, YIP YIP.

173
00:08:23,125 --> 00:08:25,041
- [growls]

174
00:08:31,041 --> 00:08:32,667
- [whimpers]

175
00:08:52,709 --> 00:08:55,208
- NICE NIGHT FOR AN ESCAPE,
ISN'T IT?

176
00:08:57,208 --> 00:08:58,500
- I HAVE TO LEAVE.

177
00:08:58,542 --> 00:09:01,041
I HAVE TO FIND MY OWN PATH

AANG'S TIME HAS PASSED.

180
00:09:08,041 --> 00:09:11,792
MY BROTHER AND MANY
OF MY FRIENDS ARE GONE.

181
00:09:11,834 --> 00:09:14,709
IT'S TIME FOR YOU

183
00:09:16,291 --> 00:09:19,667

00:11:41,709 --> 00:11:45,041
- UH, I DON'T HAVE
ANY MONEY?

214
00:11:45,083 --> 00:11:46,959

215
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:50,458

216
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:52,125
THE CITY'S HUGE.

TOOK ME A WHILE TO PROCURE
A BUSH THAT BEAUTEOUS.

227
00:12:30,625 --> 00:12:33,667
THIS PARK IS QUITE POPULAR
WITH ALL THE VAGABONDS.

228
00:12:33,709 --> 00:12:36,709
- SO THERE ARE A LOT OF YOU
OUT HERE?

229
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:39,500
I THOUGHT EVERYONE IN THIS CITY

241
00:13:05,792 --> 00:13:06,750

242
00:13:06,792 --> 00:13:08,792
THEN JOIN THE EQUALISTS.

243
00:13:08,834 --> 00:13:11,542
FOR TOO LONG,
THE BENDING ELITE

244
00:13:11,583 --> 00:13:13,583
OF THIS CITY
HAVE FORCED NON-BENDERS

245
00:13:13,625 --> 00:13:16,000
TO LIVE AS LOWER-CLASS CITIZENS.

246
00:13:16,041 --> 00:13:19,333
JOIN AMON, AND TOGETHER
WE WILL TEAR DOWN

247
00:13:19,375 --> 00:13:20,959
THE BENDING ESTABLISHMENT.

248
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,333
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

249
00:13:22,375 --> 00:13:24,250
BENDING IS THE COOLEST THING
IN THE WORLD.

250
00:13:24,291 --> 00:13:26,208
- OH, YEAH?
LET ME GUESS.

251
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:27,917
YOU'RE A BENDER.

252
00:13:27,959 --> 00:13:29,458
- YEAH, I AM.

00:13:31,709 --> 00:13:34,208
OFF THIS PLATFORM
WITH SOME WATERBENDING, HUH?

255
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:36,583
- I'M SERIOUSLY THINKING
ABOUT IT.

256
00:13:36,625 --> 00:13:38,792
- THIS IS WHAT'S WRONG
WITH THE CITY.

257
00:13:38,834 --> 00:13:41,542
BENDERS LIKE THIS GIRL
ONLY USE THEIR POWER

258
00:13:41,583 --> 00:13:42,917
TO OPPRESS US.

259
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:44,125
[all shouting]

260
00:13:44,166 --> 00:13:45,583
- WHAT?

261
00:13:45,625 --> 00:13:47,583
I'M NOT OPPRESSING ANYONE.

262
00:13:47,625 --> 00:13:50,417
YOU'RE...
YOU'RE OPPRESSING YOURSELF.

263
00:13:50,458 --> 00:13:53,542
- THAT DIDN'T EVEN MAKE SENSE.

264
00:13:57,875 --> 00:14:01,041
- EXCUSE ME.
I THINK I'M LOST.

265
00:14:01,083 --> 00:14:03,625
HOW DO I GET
TO AIR TEMPLE ISLAND FROM HERE?

266
00:14:03,667 --> 00:14:05,041
- JUST HEAD DOWN THIS STREET.

267
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:08,792
YOU SHOULD GET MOVING,
YOUNG LADY.

268
00:14:08,834 --> 00:14:11,041
IT ISN'T SAFE.

269
00:14:13,709 --> 00:14:17,917
- MR. CHUNG, PLEASE TELL ME
THAT YOU HAVE MY MONEY.

270
00:14:17,959 --> 00:14:20,208
OR ELSE I CAN'T GUARANTEE
I CAN PROTECT

271
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:21,875
YOUR FINE ESTABLISHMENT.

272
00:14:21,917 --> 00:14:24,709

BUSINESS HAS BEEN SLOW.

273
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:26,375
PLEASE TAKE ONE

275
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:32,417

IS NOT A MUSIC LOVER.

276
00:14:32,458 --> 00:14:35,291
GIVE ME THE MONEY OR ELSE--

277
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:37,667
- OR ELSE WHAT, HOODLUM?

278
00:14:40,333 --> 00:14:43,250
[laughter]

279
00:14:45,792 --> 00:14:48,542

280
00:14:48,583 --> 00:14:50,875
LET ME EXPLAIN
A COUPLE THINGS.

I HOPE
THERE'S ONE NEARBY.

287
00:15:02,333 --> 00:15:04,000
- WHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE?

288
00:15:04,041 --> 00:15:06,041
- WHY DON'T YOU COME
AND FIND OUT?

289

THEY WERE SMASHING UP A SHOP.

319

00:16:45,583 --> 00:16:47,041
YOU SMASHED UP A LOT MORE
THAN THAT.

321
00:16:47,083 --> 00:16:50,792

357
00:18:47,625 --> 00:18:48,959
LIN BEIFONG?

358
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,250
YOU'RE TOPH'S DAUGHTER.
- WHAT OF IT?

359
00:18:51,291 --> 00:18:54,000
- WELL, THEN, WHY ARE YOU
TREATING ME LIKE A CRIMINAL?

360
00:18:54,041 --> 00:18:55,709
AVATAR AANG AND YOUR MOTHER
WERE FRIENDS.

361
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:57,458
THEY SAVED THE WORLD TOGETHER.

362
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:59,166
- THAT'S ANCIENT HISTORY.

363
00:18:59,208 --> 00:19:01,250
AND IT'S GOT DIDDLY SQUAT
TO DO WITH THE MESS

364
00:19:01,291 --> 00:19:02,750
YOU ARE IN RIGHT NOW.

365
00:19:02,792 --> 00:19:04,333
YOU CAN'T JUST WALTZ IN HERE

366
00:19:04,375 --> 00:19:05,750
AND DOLE OUT VIGILANTE JUSTICE

367
00:19:05,792 --> 00:19:07,750
LIKE YOU OWN THE PLACE.

368
00:19:07,792 --> 00:19:10,542
- CHIEF, COUNCILMAN TENZIN
IS HERE.

369
00:19:10,583 --> 00:19:13,208
- LET HIM IN.

370
00:19:15,834 --> 00:19:17,208
- TENZIN.

371
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:20,000
SORRY.
I GOT A LITTLE SIDETRACKED

372
00:19:20,041 --> 00:19:21,542
ON MY WAY TO SEE YOU.

373
00:19:21,583 --> 00:19:24,458
- [inhales]

374
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:27,125
LIN, YOU ARE LOOKING RADIANT
AS USUAL.

375
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:28,583
- CUT THE GARBAGE, TENZIN.

376
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:31,083
WHY IS THE AVATAR
IN REPUBLIC CITY?

377
00:19:31,125 --> 00:19:32,875
I THOUGHT YOU WERE SUPPOSED
TO BE MOVING DOWN

378
00:19:32,917 --> 00:19:34,291
TO THE SOUTH POLE
TO TRAIN HER.

379
00:19:34,333 --> 00:19:36,875
- MY RELOCATION
HAS BEEN DELAYED.

380
00:19:36,917 --> 00:19:39,083
THE AVATAR,
ON THE OTHER HAND,

381
00:19:39,125 --> 00:19:41,458
WILL BE HEADING BACK
TO THE SOUTH POLE IMMEDIATELY,

382
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:43,959
WHERE SHE WILL STAY PUT.

383
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,750
- BUT--
- IF YOU WOULD BE SO KIND

384
00:19:45,792 --> 00:19:48,500
AS TO DROP THE CHARGES
AGAINST KORRA,

385
00:19:48,542 --> 00:19:52,125
I WILL TAKE FULL RESPONSIBILITY
FOR TODAY'S REGRETTABLE EVENTS

386
00:19:52,166 --> 00:19:54,417
AND COVER ALL THE DAMAGES.

387
00:19:56,834 --> 00:20:00,375
- FINE.
GET HER OUT OF MY CITY.

388
00:20:00,417 --> 00:20:01,875
- ALWAYS A PLEASURE, LIN.

389
00:20:01,917 --> 00:20:04,625
LET'S GO, KORRA.

390
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:13,333
- HMM.

391
00:20:13,375 --> 00:20:15,917
- TENZIN, PLEASE,
DON'T SEND ME BACK HOME.

392
00:20:15,959 --> 00:20:17,917
- YOU BLATANTLY DISOBEYED
MY WISHES

393
00:20:17,959 --> 00:20:19,917
AND THE ORDERS
OF THE WHITE LOTUS.

394
00:20:19,959 --> 00:20:21,917
- KATARA AGREED WITH ME
THAT I SHOULD COME.

395
00:20:21,959 --> 00:20:24,583
SHE SAID MY DESTINY
IS IN REPUBLIC CITY.

396
00:20:24,625 --> 00:20:26,709
- DON'T BRING MY MOTHER
INTO THIS!

397
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:28,667
- LOOK, I CAN'T WAIT
ANY LONGER

398
00:20:28,709 --> 00:20:29,667
TO FINISH MY TRAINING.

399
00:20:29,709 --> 00:20:31,417
BEING COOPED UP
AND HIDDEN AWAY

400
00:20:31,458 --> 00:20:32,458
FROM THE WORLD
ISN'T HELPING ME

401
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:34,125
BECOME A BETTER AVATAR.

402
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:36,417
I SAW A LOT OF THE CITY TODAY,

403
00:20:36,458 --> 00:20:38,333
AND IT'S TOTALLY OUT OF WHACK.

404
00:20:38,375 --> 00:20:40,500
I UNDERSTAND NOW
WHY YOU NEED TO STAY.

405
00:20:40,542 --> 00:20:43,208
REPUBLIC CITY DOES NEED YOU,

406
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:44,500
BUT IT NEEDS ME TOO.

407
00:20:44,542 --> 00:20:46,500
- [stammers]

408
00:20:46,542 --> 00:20:49,291
[sighs]

409
00:20:49,333 --> 00:20:51,333
- IS THIS YOUR POLAR BEAR DOG,
MISS?

410
00:21:20,834 --> 00:21:24,375
all: KORRA!

411
00:21:24,417 --> 00:21:26,667
- ARE YOU COMING TO LIVE WITH US
ON THE ISLAND?

412
00:21:26,709 --> 00:21:29,083
- NO.
I'M SORRY, IKKI.

413
00:21:29,125 --> 00:21:31,750
I HAVE TO GO HOME NOW.
- AW.

414
00:21:37,875 --> 00:21:39,041
- WAIT.

415
00:21:39,083 --> 00:21:41,166
I HAVE DONE MY BEST

416
00:21:41,208 --> 00:21:43,083
TO GUIDE REPUBLIC CITY
TOWARDS THE DREAM

417
00:21:43,125 --> 00:21:44,333
MY FATHER HAD FOR IT.

418
00:21:44,375 --> 00:21:45,917
BUT YOU ARE RIGHT.

419
00:21:45,959 --> 00:21:48,375
IT HAS FALLEN OUT OF BALANCE
SINCE HE PASSED.

420
00:21:48,417 --> 00:21:49,709
I THOUGHT I SHOULD PUT OFF
YOUR TRAINING

421
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:52,000
IN ORDER TO UPHOLD HIS LEGACY,

422
00:21:52,041 --> 00:21:54,375
BUT YOU ARE HIS LEGACY.

423
00:21:54,417 --> 00:21:57,750
YOU MAY STAY AND TRAIN
AIRBENDING HERE WITH ME.

424
00:21:57,792 --> 00:21:58,917
- [gasps]
- REPUBLIC CITY

425
00:21:58,959 --> 00:22:00,583
NEEDS ITS AVATAR ONCE AGAIN.

426
00:22:00,625 --> 00:22:02,333
- YES!
THANK YOU.

427
00:22:02,375 --> 00:22:03,625
YOU'RE THE BEST.

428
00:22:03,667 --> 00:22:06,291
all: YAY!

429
00:22:06,333 --> 00:22:07,709
- [giggles]

430
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:09,667
- [loving sigh]

431
00:22:09,709 --> 00:22:12,291
- [sighs]

432
00:22:12,333 --> 00:22:15,000
[cheers and applause]

433
00:22:19,542 --> 00:22:20,709
- [clears throat]

434
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:23,542
HELLO, I'M KORRA,

435
00:22:23,583 --> 00:22:26,291
YOUR NEW AVATAR.

436
00:22:26,333 --> 00:22:28,208
- DOES THIS MEAN YOU'VE MOVED
TO REPUBLIC CITY?

437
00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:30,500
- WERE YOU TRYING TO SEND A
MESSAGE TO THE TRIADS YESTERDAY?

438
00:22:30,542 --> 00:22:32,250
- WILL YOU BE FIGHTING CRIME

439
00:22:32,291 --> 00:22:34,375
OR THE ANTI-BENDING REVOLUTION
OR BOTH?

440
00:22:34,417 --> 00:22:36,875
- WILL YOU BE WORKING WITH
CHIEF BEIFONG AND THE POLICE?

441
00:22:36,917 --> 00:22:40,125
- UH, YES, I AM DEFINITELY HERE
TO STAY,

442
00:22:40,166 --> 00:22:43,959
BUT, HONESTLY, I-I DON'T EXACTLY
HAVE A PLAN YET.

443
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,709
SEE,
I'M STILL IN TRAINING,

444
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:49,375
BUT, LOOK, ALL I KNOW
IS AVATAR AANG

445
00:22:49,417 --> 00:22:51,625
MEANT FOR THIS CITY
TO BE THE CENTER

446
00:22:51,667 --> 00:22:53,959
OF PEACE AND BALANCE
IN THE WORLD.

447
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:58,542
AND I BELIEVE
WE CAN MAKE HIS DREAM A REALITY.

448
00:22:58,583 --> 00:23:01,542
I LOOK FORWARD
TO SERVING YOU.

449
00:23:01,583 --> 00:23:03,792
I'M SO HAPPY TO BE HERE.

450
00:23:03,834 --> 00:23:06,000
THANK YOU, REPUBLIC CITY.

451
00:23:06,041 --> 00:23:08,291
- ALL RIGHT.
THAT'S ALL THE QUESTIONS THE--

452
00:23:08,333 --> 00:23:11,000
- AMON, HOW DO YOU WANT
TO HANDLE THIS?

453
00:23:11,041 --> 00:23:14,208
- SO THE AVATAR
HAS ARRIVED EARLY.

454
00:23:14,250 --> 00:23:18,709
IT LOOKS LIKE WE'LL HAVE
TO ACCELERATE OUR PLANS.
