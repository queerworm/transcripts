00:00:14,930 --> 00:00:19,060
Only the Avatar can
master all four elements

6
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:22,070
and bring balance to the world.

[Dramatic music]

8
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:29,470
Six months ago, Avatar Korra defeated

9
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:31,140
Amon and The Equalists.

10
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:33,110
Since then, the council was disbanded

11
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:35,910
and the united Republic
elected its first president.

12
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:37,920
Tenzin's brother, commander Bumi,

13
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,450
retired and moved to air temple island.

14
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:42,320
And Korra and her boyfriend, Mako,

15
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:43,750
have been the talk of the town.

16
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:45,520
Peace has come to Republic city,

17
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,360
but unbeknownst to the Avatar,

18
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,930
danger now threatens
the Southern water tribe.

[Horn blares]

20
00:00:51,330 --> 00:00:53,330
This your first watch?

21
00:00:53,330 --> 00:00:54,500
Mm-hmm.

22
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:56,330
Well then, you'd better keep

23
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:57,940
your eyes peeled, laddie.

24
00:00:57,940 --> 00:01:01,640

lurk in the murky depths.

What?

29
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:15,350
Aah!

[Bell dings]

32
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:31,130
It's pro-bending night in Republic City,

33
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:33,670
and have we got a doozy for you.

34
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:35,370
Fan favorites, the fire ferrets,

35
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:37,340
are about to take on hot newcomers,

36
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:39,110
the rhino-lions.

37
00:01:39,110 --> 00:01:41,610
Now we all know that our
last match was garbage.

38
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:42,750
Terrible.

39
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:44,280
Even Pabu could have done a better job.

[Pabu chitters]

41
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,750
But that's in the past,

42
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:49,050
because when you back a
fire ferret in the corner,

43
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:51,020
well, mister, he comes out fighting!

44
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:52,060
[Pabu hisses]

45
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:54,060
So let's get out there

46
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:55,890
and bend like there's no tomorrow.

47
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:58,260

Ooh, the fire ferrets go down in the water

52
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:09,940
and right into the record books

53
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:12,840
for the fastest knockout
in pro-bending history.

54
00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:15,610

Good thing the police are here.

00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:26,250
I think these planes are
finally ready to ship.

68
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:28,920
I hate to mention the
elephant-rhino in the room,

69
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:31,020
but since your father was thrown in prison,

70
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:32,890
no company will work with us.

The Avatar is the winner!

00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:21,270
No fair.

81
00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:23,740
You can't go into the Avatar state to win.

82
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:25,510
- [Raspberries]
- You did what?

83
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:30,450
The Avatar state is not to
be used as a booster rocket.

84
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:32,480
You are toying with a dangerous power

85
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,150
that you obviously do not appreciate.

86
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:37,320
It's the "Avatar state,"
and I'm the Avatar.

87
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:39,090
Who appreciates it more than me?

88
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:41,290

the depths of your spiritual connections,

90

not to mention that you're still a long way

00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:47,630
from mastering air-bending.

92
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:49,830

from the united forces?

through, little brother.

You've mastered Korra-style air-bending.

101
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:14,660
Now you need to master real air-bending.

102
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:17,260
Hopefully, our visit to
all of the air temples

103
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:19,130
will give you the inspiration you need

104
00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:22,070
to delve more deeply into your studies.

106
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:25,270
How many lemurs can I have?

107
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:27,200
I want to get tattoos,
but instead of arrows,

108
00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:28,540
I want lightning bolts.

109
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:30,070
You can't get lightning bolts.

110
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,610
That doesn't make any sense.

111
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:33,440
You don't make any sense!

112
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:34,810
Fight, fight, fight!

[Groans]

116
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:43,150
Now that the president is in office

117
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,790
and I'm not needed on the council,

118
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:46,890
I can finally relax with my family

119
00:05:46,890 --> 00:05:49,260
and give Korra the attention she needs.

120
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:51,230
Great. More attention.

121
00:05:51,230 --> 00:05:53,360
[Laughs] Relax?

122
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:55,270
I'd pay money to see that.

123
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:59,400
Maybe I'll tag along just
to see "Vacation Tenzin."

Before we go on your dad's study trip,

126
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:05,910
we're going to have some
real fun in my hometown

127
00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:07,440
at the glacier spirits festival.

128
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:08,850
They've got rides, games,

129
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:10,880
and all kinds of fried food on sticks.

130
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,850
All: Yay!

131
00:06:12,850 --> 00:06:13,880
[Excitedly chattering]

132
00:06:13,890 --> 00:06:16,720
Yep, there's vacation Tenzin.

133
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,390
And you can't stop me
from going to the festival.

134
00:06:19,390 --> 00:06:22,360
Mom already invited me.

[Chuckles]

137
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:28,370
So I walk up and say,

138
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:31,030
"looks like you had some car trouble.

139
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:33,200
Good thing the police are here."

140
00:06:33,210 --> 00:06:35,940
[Laughs] Did you write that beforehand?

141
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:39,380
Yeah, I had a few others. Let's see, uh...

142
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:43,410
"Looks like you guys should
put more 'try' in triad," huh?

143
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:47,950
Or, "when you get to jail,
tell 'em Mako sent ya."

144
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:49,550
Ooh, I like that one.

145
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:52,420
Okay, I'll use that next time.

146
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:55,730
Beifong says if I keep it up,
I could make detective soon.

147
00:06:55,730 --> 00:06:57,560
Oh, that sounds so fun.

148
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:59,600
All I do is train all day.

149
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:03,400
It's like Tenzin's totally
forgotten how I beat Amon.

150
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:05,100
Tenzin's just trying to help you become

151
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:07,140
the best Avatar you can be.

152
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:08,940
Of course you'd take his side.

153
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:10,670
I'm not taking his side. I'm just...

154
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:13,610
I'm gonna take a walk.

155
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:17,750
Why is it so much easier to bust triads

156
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:22,750
than it is to get through one
conversation with my girlfriend?

157
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,790
Grangran!

158
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:30,130
Oh, you've all gotten so big.

159
00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:31,730
We missed you, aunt Kya.

Oh, I missed you too.

161
00:07:34,170 --> 00:07:37,000
Your father doesn't bring
you to visit nearly enough.

162
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,140
He's probably scared I'll beat him up

163
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:40,200
like when we were kids.

164
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:42,570
I'm not scared of you...

165
00:07:42,570 --> 00:07:45,740
Anymore.

- Sir.

00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,810
I hope you're not getting my daughter

168

into any more trouble up in the city.

169
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:55,590
Uh, no. I, uh... no.

170
00:07:55,590 --> 00:07:58,660
- Knock it off, dad.

Just relax, Tonraq.

Whoa, who are the lovely ladies?

183
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:34,930
That's Eska and Desna,
the chief's children.

365
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:27,040
or one of his kids.

366
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:29,340
I'll never finish training
with him in charge.

367
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:32,710
[Bell dings]

368
00:16:32,710 --> 00:16:35,540
We have a winner.

369
00:16:35,550 --> 00:16:38,050
I mean, you heard what Unalaq said.

370
00:16:38,050 --> 00:16:40,150
The South is spiritually unbalanced,

371
00:16:40,150 --> 00:16:42,380
and it's the Avatar's job to fix it.

372
00:16:42,390 --> 00:16:43,390
But my dad won't even let me

373
00:16:43,390 --> 00:16:46,590
think about Unalaq teaching me.

374
00:16:46,590 --> 00:16:47,760
- Well?
- Well, what?

375
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:49,760
What do you think I should do?

376
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:52,430
I guess you should do
what you think is right.

377
00:16:52,430 --> 00:16:54,200
I support whatever decision you make.

378
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:57,030
Oh, thanks. That's a big help.

379
00:16:57,030 --> 00:16:59,430
I thought you wanted me to be supportive.

380
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,500
Now you want me to tell you what I think?

381
00:17:01,510 --> 00:17:02,770
Make up your mind.

382
00:17:02,770 --> 00:17:04,670
Oof!

383
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:08,280
Just forget it.

384
00:17:12,950 --> 00:17:15,820
[Bells chiming]

385
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:19,960
Ugh.

386
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:21,160
Naga, what are you doing?

387
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:22,190
[Naga howling]

388
00:17:22,190 --> 00:17:24,060
Naga, hush.

389
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:29,670
[Howling continues]

390
00:17:29,670 --> 00:17:32,100
Quiet, Naga. You'll wake everyone up.

391
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:34,200
[Naga howling]

392
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:36,140
[Yawns] What's going on?

393
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:43,780
What is that?

394
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:46,450
Ugh!

395
00:17:46,450 --> 00:17:49,350
[Groans]

396
00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:53,560
[Spirit growls]

397
00:17:56,350 --> 00:17:58,550
[Groans]

398
00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:04,930
Got it!

399
00:18:04,930 --> 00:18:05,960
Don't got it!

400
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:10,130
[Both groaning]

401
00:18:24,650 --> 00:18:27,050
Korra!

402
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:38,230
Aah!

403
00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:39,890
[Screams]

404
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:41,900
[Groans]

405
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:44,030
Aah!

406
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:46,630
[Groans]

407
00:18:51,770 --> 00:18:55,180
Spirit, why are you angry with us?

408
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:59,950
What have we done to offend you?

409
00:18:59,950 --> 00:19:01,780
[Groans]

410
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:29,540
[Grunts]

411
00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:33,650
[Groans]

412
00:20:19,630 --> 00:20:23,000
Go in peace.

413
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:29,700
Korra, are you all right?

414
00:20:29,710 --> 00:20:31,340
How were you able to control that spirit

415
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:32,470
when no one else could?

416
00:20:32,470 --> 00:20:33,970
As your father could tell you,

417
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:36,240
I have spent my life studying the spirits

418
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:38,040
and learning their ways.

419
00:20:38,050 --> 00:20:40,310
All of this knowledge is lost in the South,

420
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:43,350
but I could teach you everything I know.

421
00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:46,790
Chief Unalaq, clearly,
you are very knowledgeable,

422
00:20:46,790 --> 00:20:49,490
but Korra still has much
to learn about air-bending,

423
00:20:49,490 --> 00:20:52,190
and I hope that going to the air temples

424
00:20:52,190 --> 00:20:54,630
will help her connect
with the past avatars.

425
00:20:54,630 --> 00:20:55,900
Ugh!

426
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:57,960
The air temples will teach her nothing.

427
00:20:57,970 --> 00:21:00,370
Only I can give her the training she needs

428
00:21:00,370 --> 00:21:02,800
to be a complete Avatar.

429
00:21:02,810 --> 00:21:05,010
I've told you that will not happen.

430
00:21:05,010 --> 00:21:06,610
Hey, I'm right here!

431
00:21:06,610 --> 00:21:08,780
Anyone want to ask me what I think?

432
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:10,340
Korra, please, listen.

433
00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:12,910
I'm tired of listening
to you... both of you.

434
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:14,580
You keep me locked up,

435
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:16,120
telling me you know what's best,

436
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:17,520
but both of you were powerless

437
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:20,520
against the spirit attack.

438
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:25,030
I think it's time I had a new teacher.

439
00:21:25,030 --> 00:21:26,590
Now, Korra...

440
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:27,960
Unalaq has proven he's the only one

441
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:31,630
who knows what I need to learn.

442
00:21:31,630 --> 00:21:33,100
I have to go with him.

443
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:35,500
Please, I know you're angry,

444
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:37,940
but we've come so far together.

445
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:40,340
I'm sorry, Tenzin.

446
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:43,080
This is as far as we go.

447
00:21:46,950 --> 00:21:49,180
It has been a pleasure serving you,

448
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:51,650
Avatar Korra.

449
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:05,470
I think you forgot a couple of things.

450
00:22:05,470 --> 00:22:08,370
Mother, I think I need some time alone

451
00:22:08,370 --> 00:22:09,740
with my family right now.

452
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:12,070
This is your family, Tenzin.

453
00:22:12,070 --> 00:22:13,410
When you get to be my age,

454
00:22:13,410 --> 00:22:15,280
you'll be thankful for the time you had

455
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:16,640
with your siblings.

456
00:22:16,650 --> 00:22:19,050
Besides, I think it's important

457
00:22:19,050 --> 00:22:22,580
that you all visit your
father's home together.

458
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:24,550
Come on, it'll be fun.

459
00:22:24,550 --> 00:22:27,490
I'm dying to see that
laid-back "vacation Tenzin"

460
00:22:27,490 --> 00:22:29,020
I've heard so much about.

461
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:33,330
All right. Hop on.

462
00:22:33,330 --> 00:22:35,260
I love you, mom.

463
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:36,760
We'll see you soon.

464
00:22:36,770 --> 00:22:40,130
[Grunts] Oh!

465
00:22:47,170 --> 00:22:49,480
Do you think I did the right thing?

466
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:51,580
[Sighs] I don't know.

467
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:53,580
I'm sorry, but I'm not very good

468
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:55,950
at this Avatar counseling thing.

469
00:22:55,950 --> 00:22:58,120
But I know your heart
is in the right place.

470
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:00,720
You'll just have to trust it.

471
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:09,430
I know this was a hard decision, Korra.

472
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:11,330
But it was the right one.

473
00:23:11,330 --> 00:23:13,470
Now it is time to put it behind you

474
00:23:13,470 --> 00:23:14,870
and begin your new training.

475
00:23:14,870 --> 00:23:18,140
I have great plans for you.
