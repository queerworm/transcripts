1
00:00:00,752 --> 00:00:01,882
<i>Earth.</i>

2
00:00:02,629 --> 00:00:03,749
<i>Fire.</i>

3
00:00:04,297 --> 00:00:05,507
<i>Air.</i>

4
00:00:06,007 --> 00:00:07,087
Water.

5
00:00:08,218 --> 00:00:12,138
<i>Only the Avatar can master</i>
<i>all four elements</i>

6
00:00:12,222 --> 00:00:14,352
<i>and bring balance to the world.</i>

7
00:00:20,147 --> 00:00:21,807
<i>After a close encounter with Amon,</i>

8
00:00:21,898 --> 00:00:24,818
<i>Korra took a leave of absence</i>
<i>from Tarrlok's task force.</i>

9
00:00:24,985 --> 00:00:27,025
<i>But the Avatar</i>
<i>has still been hard at work,</i>

10
00:00:27,112 --> 00:00:30,572
<i>leading the underdog Fire Ferrets</i>
<i>to the Pro-bending championship finals.</i>

11
00:00:30,866 --> 00:00:33,826
<i>Only one team stands in their way,</i>
<i>the Wolf-bats.</i>

12
00:00:34,035 --> 00:00:35,155
<i>Led by team captain Tahno,</i>

13
00:00:35,245 --> 00:00:37,405
<i>the brutal Wolf-bats</i>
<i>look to repeat as champs.</i>

14
00:00:37,497 --> 00:00:39,327
<i>Have the Fire Ferrets</i>
<i>finally met their match?</i>

15
00:00:55,515 --> 00:00:58,265
You are listening to the Music Hour,

16
00:00:58,393 --> 00:01:00,853
<i>brought to you by Cabbage Corp.</i>

17
00:01:01,229 --> 00:01:05,319
<i>Republic City's trusted name</i>
<i>in technology for over 50 years.</i>

18
00:01:05,650 --> 00:01:07,440
Man, I got a good feeling about tonight!

19
00:01:07,527 --> 00:01:11,067
I don't care if we are the underdogs,
we can take those pompous Wolf-bats.

20
00:01:11,281 --> 00:01:14,281
It's going to be our toughest match ever,
but I think you're right.

21
00:01:14,284 --> 00:01:20,084
Introducing your new champs,
the fantastic Fire Ferrets!

22
00:01:20,665 --> 00:01:24,075
<i>Good morning, citizens of Republic City.</i>

23
00:01:24,294 --> 00:01:25,544
<i>This is Amon.</i>

24
00:01:25,629 --> 00:01:29,219
<i>I hope you all enjoyed last night's</i>
<i>Pro-bending match,</i>

25
00:01:29,633 --> 00:01:32,223
<i>because it will be the last.</i>

26
00:01:32,302 --> 00:01:36,142
<i>It's time for this city</i>
<i>to stop worshipping bending athletes</i>

27
00:01:36,223 --> 00:01:37,643
<i>as if they were heroes.</i>

28
00:01:38,183 --> 00:01:42,023
<i>I am calling on the Council</i>
<i>to shut down the bending Arena</i>

29
00:01:42,312 --> 00:01:44,272
<i>and cancel the finals,</i>

30
00:01:44,356 --> 00:01:48,316
<i>or else there will be</i>
<i>severe consequences.</i>

31
00:01:49,236 --> 00:01:51,106
That guy's got some nerve!

32
00:01:51,196 --> 00:01:52,316
You think the Council will give in?

33
00:01:52,405 --> 00:01:55,365
I'm not waiting to find out.
We need to get to City Hall.

34
00:02:02,832 --> 00:02:05,332
Korra, you shouldn't be here.
This is a closed meeting.

35
00:02:05,669 --> 00:02:09,259
As the Avatar, and a Pro-bending
player, I have a right to be heard.

36
00:02:09,339 --> 00:02:10,549
You can't cancel the finals.

37
00:02:11,007 --> 00:02:13,257
I know winning the Championship
means a lot to you,

38
00:02:13,343 --> 00:02:16,303
but as far as I'm concerned,
we need to shut the Arena down.

39
00:02:16,555 --> 00:02:17,845
What about the rest of you?

40
00:02:18,014 --> 00:02:20,854
Tarrlok, there's no way
you're backing down from Amon, right?

41
00:02:20,934 --> 00:02:24,234
Actually, Tenzin and I agree, for once.

42
00:02:24,354 --> 00:02:27,314
The Council is unanimous.
We're closing the Arena.

43
00:02:27,399 --> 00:02:28,979
- No!
- You can't!

44
00:02:29,067 --> 00:02:30,067
I don't understand.

45
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:33,450
I thought you of all people
would take a stand against Amon.

46
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:37,370
While I am still committed
to bringing that lunatic to justice,

47
00:02:37,367 --> 00:02:39,787
I will not put innocent lives at stake,

48
00:02:39,869 --> 00:02:43,249
just so you and your friends
can play a game.

49
00:02:43,373 --> 00:02:45,793
Pro-bending might only
be a game to you,

50
00:02:45,875 --> 00:02:47,665
but think of what it means to the city.

51
00:02:47,752 --> 00:02:51,382
Right now the Arena is the one place
where benders and non-benders

52
00:02:51,381 --> 00:02:53,881
gather together in peace

53
00:02:53,967 --> 00:02:56,387
- to watch benders...
- Beat each other up

54
00:02:56,886 --> 00:02:57,926
in peace!

55
00:02:58,096 --> 00:03:00,216
It's an inspiration to everyone!

56
00:03:00,348 --> 00:03:02,678
I appreciate your naive idealism,

57
00:03:02,767 --> 00:03:05,387
but you're ignoring
the reality of the situation.

58
00:03:05,395 --> 00:03:09,055
The reality is, if you close the Arena,
you let Amon win!

59
00:03:09,149 --> 00:03:11,439
Yes, exactly what she said! Yes.

60
00:03:11,693 --> 00:03:14,783
I'm sorry, but our decision
has been made.

61
00:03:14,863 --> 00:03:16,203
This meeting is adjourned.

62
00:03:21,661 --> 00:03:25,411
I can't believe I'm saying this,
but I agree with the Avatar.

63
00:03:25,707 --> 00:03:28,037
- You do?
- Yeah, you do?

64
00:03:28,418 --> 00:03:31,418
I expected this kind of cut and run
response from Tenzin,

65
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:32,960
but the rest of you?

66
00:03:33,214 --> 00:03:35,844
Come on, show a little more backbone.

67
00:03:36,009 --> 00:03:38,429
It's time that the benders of this city

68
00:03:38,428 --> 00:03:41,758
displayed some strength and unity
against these Equalists.

69
00:03:41,848 --> 00:03:45,478
We must prevent the conflict
between benders and non-benders

70
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:47,440
from escalating into all-out war!

71
00:03:47,687 --> 00:03:50,017
The Council is not changing
its position, Lin.

72
00:03:50,273 --> 00:03:52,363
Now, just a moment, Tenzin.

73
00:03:52,442 --> 00:03:56,282
Let us hear what our esteemed
Chief of Police has in mind.

74
00:03:57,447 --> 00:03:59,237
If you keep the Arena open,

75
00:03:59,324 --> 00:04:00,454
my metalbenders and I

76
00:04:00,533 --> 00:04:03,543
will provide extra security
during the Championship match.

77
00:04:03,703 --> 00:04:06,253
There's no better force
to deal with the Chi-blockers.

78
00:04:06,414 --> 00:04:08,584
Our armor is impervious to their attacks.

79
00:04:08,792 --> 00:04:12,382
Are you saying that you will
personally take responsibility

80
00:04:12,462 --> 00:04:15,092
for the safety of the spectators
in the Arena?

81
00:04:15,382 --> 00:04:16,422
I guarantee it.

82
00:04:16,508 --> 00:04:20,758
It is hard to argue
with Chief Beifong's track record.

83
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:24,560
If she is confident her elite officers
can protect the Arena,

84
00:04:24,641 --> 00:04:26,681
then she has my support.

85
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:28,520
I am changing my vote.

86
00:04:29,187 --> 00:04:30,477
Who else is with me?

87
00:04:32,649 --> 00:04:34,479
The Arena stays open.

88
00:04:35,026 --> 00:04:36,026
Good luck in the finals.

89
00:04:36,277 --> 00:04:38,067
- All right!
- Thank you!

90
00:04:38,154 --> 00:04:41,454
And good luck to you, Chief Beifong.

91
00:04:42,575 --> 00:04:44,485
A word, please, Lin.

92
00:04:46,121 --> 00:04:48,911
Tarrlok's playing you,
and I don't want to see you get hurt.

93
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:51,580
I know what I'm doing
and the risks that come with it.

94
00:04:51,668 --> 00:04:54,378
In that case, I'm going to be
by your side during the match.

95
00:04:54,504 --> 00:04:56,554
You don't need to babysit me.

96
00:04:56,631 --> 00:04:59,511
It's for Korra.
I want to make sure she's safe.

97
00:04:59,634 --> 00:05:03,264
Do what you want. It's not like
I've ever been able to stop you before.

98
00:05:03,513 --> 00:05:06,523
Excuse me, Chief Beifong?
I wanted to thank you for your help.

99
00:05:06,516 --> 00:05:09,096
It really means a lot.

100
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:11,520
What is her deal?

101
00:05:11,646 --> 00:05:14,016
Even when she's on my side,
she's against me.

102
00:05:14,107 --> 00:05:15,897
I've known Lin since we were children.

103
00:05:16,109 --> 00:05:17,479
She's always been

104
00:05:18,528 --> 00:05:19,528
challenging.

105
00:05:19,863 --> 00:05:23,033
What did your father do
to make her hate the Avatar so much?

106
00:05:23,241 --> 00:05:25,371
My father and Lin got along famously.

107
00:05:25,535 --> 00:05:28,405
I'm afraid her issues are with me.

108
00:05:29,581 --> 00:05:31,081
Wait a second.

109
00:05:31,166 --> 00:05:32,616
It all makes sense now!

110
00:05:33,001 --> 00:05:36,551
You and Beifong, Beifong and you.
You two were a couple!

111
00:05:36,713 --> 00:05:39,303
What? How...
Where'd you get that idea?

112
00:05:40,258 --> 00:05:41,298
Your wife.

113
00:05:41,551 --> 00:05:43,801
Criminy!
I'll have to have a word with her.

114
00:05:44,554 --> 00:05:48,184
So Pema stole you from Beifong?

115
00:05:48,266 --> 00:05:51,846
I'm surprised our esteemed Chief
of Police didn't throw her in jail.

116
00:05:51,936 --> 00:05:53,096
Oh, she tried.

117
00:05:53,188 --> 00:05:54,518
Anyway, Pema didn't "steal" me.

118
00:05:54,606 --> 00:05:57,856
Lin and I had been growing apart
for some time.

119
00:05:58,318 --> 00:06:01,398
We both had different goals in life...

120
00:06:01,488 --> 00:06:03,278
Why am I even telling you this?

121
00:06:03,364 --> 00:06:07,244
It all happened a long time ago
and we've moved past it.

122
00:06:07,577 --> 00:06:08,787
Apparently Beifong hasn't.

123
00:06:09,078 --> 00:06:11,868
What do you... Of course she has...

124
00:06:12,207 --> 00:06:14,167
Anyway, this is none of your business!

125
00:06:14,459 --> 00:06:16,879
See you at home, Mr. Heartbreaker!

126
00:06:26,054 --> 00:06:27,054
I just got word.

127
00:06:27,597 --> 00:06:29,637
The Council defied your threat.

128
00:06:30,058 --> 00:06:32,348
They're keeping the Arena open.

129
00:06:32,519 --> 00:06:33,519
Perfect.

130
00:06:33,603 --> 00:06:36,273
Everything is going according to plan.

131
00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:57,920
All clear, Chief.

132
00:07:01,094 --> 00:07:03,184
- How is the security sweep going?
- Fine.

133
00:07:03,638 --> 00:07:04,808
They've checked
underneath the stands?

134
00:07:04,889 --> 00:07:05,889
Yes.

135
00:07:05,890 --> 00:07:08,270
And you have enough officers
to cover all points of entry?

136
00:07:08,351 --> 00:07:12,521
I have the skies, the bay, and every
nook and cranny of this place covered.

137
00:07:12,605 --> 00:07:14,855
Now leave me alone
and let me do my job.

138
00:07:15,066 --> 00:07:17,066
Lin, with so much on the line,

139
00:07:17,151 --> 00:07:20,901
it would be nice if we could help
each other out, at least for one night.

140
00:07:22,907 --> 00:07:25,577
- Like old times?
- Like old times.

141
00:07:27,161 --> 00:07:30,911
Okay, I'll try to be less abrasive
than usual.

142
00:07:30,915 --> 00:07:31,915
I would appreciate that.

143
00:07:36,170 --> 00:07:37,920
<i>The anticipation is palpable</i>

144
00:07:37,922 --> 00:07:40,722
<i>as we are just moments away</i>
<i>from the Championship match.</i>

145
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,840
<i>Will the wolf-bats' ferocity</i>
<i>help them repeat as Champs,</i>

146
00:07:43,928 --> 00:07:46,508
or will the underdog
Fire Ferrets serve up

147
00:07:46,597 --> 00:07:48,847
a surprising bowl of smackdown soup?

148
00:07:49,684 --> 00:07:51,024
Now I know there's a big crowd,

149
00:07:51,102 --> 00:07:53,402
but don't be nervous,
you're gonna do great.

150
00:07:53,563 --> 00:07:54,733
I believe in you.

151
00:08:03,197 --> 00:08:06,237
<i>Introducing the challengers,</i>

152
00:08:06,325 --> 00:08:10,575
<i>the Future industries Fire Ferrets!</i>

153
00:08:33,728 --> 00:08:34,978
You're on, Pabu!

154
00:08:42,403 --> 00:08:45,993
Yes! Nailed it! He's so talented.

155
00:08:46,532 --> 00:08:48,492
<i>And their opponents,</i>

156
00:08:48,576 --> 00:08:51,996
<i>the three-time defending champions,</i>

157
00:08:51,996 --> 00:08:54,916
<i>the White Falls Wolf-bats!</i>

158
00:09:10,139 --> 00:09:13,019
They got nothing on us, buddy.
Anybody can howl.

159
00:09:14,393 --> 00:09:15,393
Whatever.

160
00:09:20,983 --> 00:09:25,033
I'm gonna knock Tahno's stupid hair
off his stupid head.

161
00:09:25,029 --> 00:09:28,029
<i>The champs and challengers face off</i>
<i>at the center line.</i>

162
00:09:28,032 --> 00:09:29,872
<i>And here we go!</i>

163
00:09:33,788 --> 00:09:37,288
<i>Tahno tries to clean the Avatar's</i>
<i>clock with some dirty water-boxing!</i>

164
00:09:37,625 --> 00:09:40,035
<i>Ming shakes off Mako's attack</i>
<i>and returns the favor.</i>

165
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:49,050
<i>Shaozu gets fancy, but Bolin ricochets</i>

166
00:09:49,053 --> 00:09:51,813
<i>a disk off the ropes and says,</i>
<i>"No thank you, sir!"</i>

167
00:09:52,181 --> 00:09:53,601
Nice shot!

168
00:09:56,227 --> 00:09:58,977
<i>The waterbenders slug it out,</i>
<i>looking evenly matched.</i>

169
00:10:00,064 --> 00:10:01,274
<i>Tahno gets a little too worked up</i>

170
00:10:01,357 --> 00:10:04,607
<i>and unleashes a deluge on Bolin</i>
<i>that will certainly elicit a foul...</i>

171
00:10:04,694 --> 00:10:06,444
<i>Or apparently not!</i>

172
00:10:06,821 --> 00:10:09,661
What's the big idea, ref?
That was a hosing foul!

173
00:10:10,074 --> 00:10:11,124
<i>And the Wolf-bats advance</i>

174
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,740
<i>despite Tahno exceeding</i>
<i>the waterbending time limit.</i>

175
00:10:13,828 --> 00:10:15,748
<i>A questionable call by the officials.</i>

176
00:10:17,164 --> 00:10:19,924
<i>Ming trips up Mako</i>
<i>with another dirty trick!</i>

177
00:10:20,376 --> 00:10:21,626
Come on, refs!

178
00:10:21,711 --> 00:10:23,801
There was some funny business
in that last play!

179
00:10:24,046 --> 00:10:26,086
Wouldn't have guessed you knew
the rules of Pro-bending.

180
00:10:26,215 --> 00:10:27,835
I've been brushing up.

181
00:10:27,925 --> 00:10:30,885
That Wolf-bat blatantly bent a disk
outside of his zone.

182
00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:32,890
<i>The Ferret brothers are backed up</i>
<i>to Zone 3</i>

183
00:10:32,972 --> 00:10:34,722
<i>and the Wolf-bats smell blood.</i>

184
00:10:40,229 --> 00:10:43,019
Looks like Tahno snuck in
an illegal icing move,

185
00:10:43,107 --> 00:10:44,727
but once again there's no call.

186
00:10:44,817 --> 00:10:46,477
I don't know what match
the refs are watching,

187
00:10:46,569 --> 00:10:48,109
but it's obviously not this one.

188
00:10:52,116 --> 00:10:54,776
<i>A splash and crash send</i>
<i>the Avatar to Zone 3 as well!</i>

189
00:10:56,996 --> 00:10:58,116
<i>It's a knockout!</i>

190
00:10:58,289 --> 00:11:01,119
<i>The wolf-bats win the championship</i>
<i>for the fourth year in a...</i>

191
00:11:01,375 --> 00:11:03,745
Hold on a second, folks!

192
00:11:04,045 --> 00:11:07,335
<i>Scratch that. The Ferrets are still alive!</i>
<i>But just barely!</i>

193
00:11:17,683 --> 00:11:19,313
<i>What an unbelievable move!</i>

194
00:11:19,393 --> 00:11:23,153
<i>These Ferrets aren't just bending</i>
<i>the elements, they're bending my mind!</i>

195
00:11:23,356 --> 00:11:26,106
<i>The underdogs survive</i>
<i>to see round two!</i>

196
00:11:28,778 --> 00:11:31,148
- What's wrong with these refs?
- They've been paid off.

197
00:11:31,364 --> 00:11:34,164
It's the only explanation.
Someone wants us to lose.

198
00:11:34,283 --> 00:11:37,163
If the Wolf-bats are going to fight dirty,
then so should we.

199
00:11:37,161 --> 00:11:40,001
No, we can't. The refs have it out for us.

200
00:11:40,081 --> 00:11:42,711
If we're going to win this thing,
it has to be fair and square.

201
00:11:43,793 --> 00:11:46,173
That's no fun, but all right.

202
00:11:46,462 --> 00:11:48,002
<i>Round two!</i>

203
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:54,390
<i>The opening salvo is a brutal brawl</i>
<i>as both sides give it their all!</i>

204
00:11:54,470 --> 00:11:58,430
<i>But once again, Tahno sneaks in</i>
<i>a little ice to get the upper hand.</i>

205
00:12:02,561 --> 00:12:04,521
<i>Those look like illegal headshots to me!</i>

206
00:12:07,191 --> 00:12:10,191
<i>Round two will be decided</i>
<i>with a tiebreaker!</i>

207
00:12:14,907 --> 00:12:18,197
The Fire Ferrets win the coin toss!

208
00:12:18,202 --> 00:12:20,162
Which element do you choose?

209
00:12:20,246 --> 00:12:21,246
I'm taking this one.

210
00:12:21,831 --> 00:12:24,211
Let's go! You and me, pretty boy.

211
00:12:24,458 --> 00:12:26,168
I thought you'd never ask.

212
00:12:37,221 --> 00:12:40,351
Come on, little girl.
Give me your best shot.

213
00:12:54,155 --> 00:12:55,155
Chump.

214
00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:02,160
<i>Round two goes to the Fire Ferrets!</i>

215
00:13:05,541 --> 00:13:07,251
- Nice one!
- That's the stuff!

216
00:13:07,251 --> 00:13:09,921
You are my hero!

217
00:13:10,212 --> 00:13:11,712
We might actually win this thing!

218
00:13:14,383 --> 00:13:16,843
Let's send them to a watery grave.

219
00:13:17,511 --> 00:13:21,641
I can't believe your sweet-tempered
father was reincarnated into that girl.

220
00:13:21,932 --> 00:13:23,182
She's tough as nails.

221
00:13:23,267 --> 00:13:25,267
Reminds me of someone else
I knew at that age.

222
00:13:25,686 --> 00:13:28,266
You two might get along,
if you would only give her a chance.

223
00:13:30,357 --> 00:13:33,357
<i>One round a piece! Who wants it more?</i>

224
00:13:35,112 --> 00:13:38,072
<i>The wolf-bats fly out of the gate,</i>
<i>swinging with bad intentions.</i>

225
00:13:38,157 --> 00:13:39,907
<i>The challengers are showing</i>
<i>a lot of heart,</i>

226
00:13:39,992 --> 00:13:42,542
<i>but the champs are really</i>
<i>starting to find their rhythm now.</i>

227
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:44,620
<i>Can the Ferrets hang in there</i>
<i>with the best,</i>

228
00:13:44,705 --> 00:13:48,285
<i>especially when the best are, frankly,</i>
<i>getting a little help from the refs?</i>

229
00:13:48,501 --> 00:13:50,881
<i>It's all down to this final round!</i>

230
00:13:52,254 --> 00:13:54,214
<i>Mako is leaving it all in the ring,</i>

231
00:13:54,298 --> 00:13:57,298
<i>but it looks like Tahno and Ming</i>
<i>are up to more shenanigans!</i>

232
00:14:02,848 --> 00:14:04,348
<i>This has gone too far!</i>

233
00:14:04,433 --> 00:14:06,143
<i>That water had rocks in it!</i>

234
00:14:06,477 --> 00:14:07,767
Knockout!

235
00:14:08,229 --> 00:14:10,229
Come on!
Those were illegal headshots!

236
00:14:10,314 --> 00:14:11,734
Open your eyes, ref!

237
00:14:11,941 --> 00:14:13,481
Well folks, it's a controversial call,

238
00:14:13,567 --> 00:14:16,777
but the Wolf-bats notch
a nasty knockout to win the match!

239
00:14:16,987 --> 00:14:20,737
For the fourth year in a row they'll be
crowned tournament champions!

240
00:14:21,825 --> 00:14:23,325
I barely broke a sweat.

241
00:14:23,702 --> 00:14:27,122
Anybody else wanna scrap
with the champs?

242
00:14:54,942 --> 00:14:56,362
Look out!

243
00:15:17,089 --> 00:15:18,089
What?

244
00:15:29,059 --> 00:15:31,769
Folks, there is some sort of
electrical disturbance in the stands.

245
00:15:31,979 --> 00:15:34,399
Metalbender cops
are dropping like bumble-flies!

246
00:15:34,857 --> 00:15:37,397
There appear to be masked members
of the audience

247
00:15:37,401 --> 00:15:40,191
wielding strange devices on their hands.

248
00:15:41,405 --> 00:15:43,485
One of them is in the booth
with me right now, folks.

249
00:15:43,741 --> 00:15:46,411
He is leveling one of those
glove devices at me now,

250
00:15:46,410 --> 00:15:49,290
and I believe
he is about to electrocute me.

251
00:15:49,413 --> 00:15:51,463
I am currently wetting my pants.

252
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:17,870
- What's going on here, ref?
- I don't know!

253
00:16:20,998 --> 00:16:23,958
All right, you want a piece
of the Wolf-bats?

254
00:16:24,251 --> 00:16:25,541
Here it comes!

255
00:16:42,687 --> 00:16:45,557
Wait! Please, don't do this!
I'll give you the championship pot!

256
00:16:45,690 --> 00:16:48,780
I'll give you everything,
just please don't take my bending!

257
00:17:23,978 --> 00:17:27,688
<i>I believe I have your attention,</i>
<i>benders of Republic City.</i>

258
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:32,030
<i>So, once again, the Wolf-bats</i>
<i>are your Pro-bending champions.</i>

259
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:37,240
<i>It seems fitting that you celebrate three</i>
<i>bullies who cheated their way to victory.</i>

260
00:17:37,575 --> 00:17:40,485
<i>Because every day,</i>
<i>you threaten and abuse</i>

261
00:17:40,578 --> 00:17:42,828
<i>your fellow non-bending citizens,</i>

262
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:46,539
<i>just like the wolf-bats did</i>
<i>to their opponents tonight.</i>

263
00:17:47,835 --> 00:17:51,835
<i>Those men were supposedly</i>
<i>the best in the bending world.</i>

264
00:17:52,131 --> 00:17:56,841
<i>And yet it only took a few moments</i>
<i>for me to cleanse them of their impurity.</i>

265
00:17:57,845 --> 00:18:01,425
<i>Let this be a warning</i>
<i>to all of you benders out there.</i>

266
00:18:01,891 --> 00:18:03,981
<i>If any of you stand in my way,</i>

267
00:18:04,435 --> 00:18:07,435
<i>you will meet the same fate.</i>

268
00:18:08,856 --> 00:18:10,856
<i>Now, to my followers...</i>

269
00:18:11,233 --> 00:18:15,783
<i>For years, the Equalists have been</i>
<i>forced to hide in the shadows.</i>

270
00:18:15,946 --> 00:18:19,816
<i>But now, we have the numbers</i>
<i>and the strength</i>

271
00:18:19,909 --> 00:18:22,739
<i>to create a new Republic City.</i>

272
00:18:23,579 --> 00:18:26,099
<i>I'm happy to tell you that the time</i>
<i>for change has finally come.</i>

273
00:18:26,123 --> 00:18:27,713
How are we gonna get out of here?

274
00:18:28,584 --> 00:18:31,924
<i>Very soon, the current</i>
<i>tyrannical bending regime...</i>

275
00:18:32,004 --> 00:18:33,764
Pabu! Listen up, buddy.

276
00:18:33,881 --> 00:18:36,301
<i>Will be replaced by a fair-minded,</i>
<i>Equalist government.</i>

277
00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:38,890
<i>- You and your children...</i>
- Stop fooling around!

278
00:18:38,886 --> 00:18:40,926
I'm not, I'm trying to save us!

279
00:18:43,265 --> 00:18:44,765
<i>It's time to take back our city.</i>

280
00:18:44,850 --> 00:18:46,610
See?
Pabu's not just a one-trick poodle-pony.

281
00:18:46,685 --> 00:18:50,435
<i>For centuries, benders have possessed</i>
<i>an unnatural advantage</i>

282
00:18:50,523 --> 00:18:52,273
<i>over ordinary people.</i>

283
00:18:52,858 --> 00:18:55,898
<i>But thankfully, modern technology</i>
<i>has provided us</i>

284
00:18:55,986 --> 00:18:58,856
<i>with a way to even out the playing field.</i>

285
00:18:58,948 --> 00:19:03,868
<i>Now anyone can hold the power</i>
<i>of a Chi-blocker in their hand.</i>

286
00:19:03,994 --> 00:19:09,544
<i>My followers and I will not rest</i>
<i>until the entire city achieves equality.</i>

287
00:19:10,126 --> 00:19:16,126
<i>And once that goal is achieved,</i>
<i>we will equalize the rest of the world.</i>

288
00:19:16,465 --> 00:19:19,625
<i>The Revolution has begun!</i>

289
00:19:43,868 --> 00:19:44,948
Tenzin!

290
00:19:54,295 --> 00:19:56,455
It's okay, Pabu, just a little explosion!

291
00:19:57,256 --> 00:19:59,416
Keep chewing, you're almost through it!

292
00:20:01,844 --> 00:20:03,184
Yes! Great job, buddy!

293
00:20:06,307 --> 00:20:08,307
- I'm going after Amon!
- Be careful!

294
00:22:43,881 --> 00:22:44,881
You all right?

295
00:22:45,132 --> 00:22:47,132
I'm fine, thanks to you.

296
00:22:47,384 --> 00:22:49,054
Don't mention it, kid.

297
00:22:49,470 --> 00:22:51,390
Looks like we lost this one.

298
00:22:53,766 --> 00:22:56,136
- I'm so glad you're okay.
- Me, too.

299
00:22:59,104 --> 00:23:03,154
I can't believe Amon did this.
I played right into his hand.

300
00:23:03,233 --> 00:23:04,573
He played us all.

301
00:23:04,651 --> 00:23:07,071
Republic City is at war.
