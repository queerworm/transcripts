1
00:00:07,750 --> 00:00:08,750
- EARTH...

2
00:00:08,792 --> 00:00:10,709
FIRE...

3
00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:12,625
AIR...

4
00:00:12,667 --> 00:00:14,583
WATER...

5
00:00:14,625 --> 00:00:18,959
ONLY THE AVATAR CAN MASTER
ALL FOUR ELEMENTS

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,709
AND BRING BALANCE
TO THE WORLD.

7
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:28,458
- AFTER A CLOSE ENCOUNTER
WITH AMON,

8
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:29,625
KORRA TOOK A LEAVE
OF ABSENCE FROM

9
00:00:29,667 --> 00:00:31,291
TARRLOK'S TASK FORCE.

10
00:00:31,333 --> 00:00:33,375
BUT THE AVATAR
HAS STILL BEEN HARD AT WORK,

11
00:00:33,417 --> 00:00:34,875
LEADING THE UNDERDOG
FIRE FERRETS

12
00:00:34,917 --> 00:00:37,333
TO THE PRO-BENDING
CHAMPIONSHIP FINALS.

13
00:00:37,375 --> 00:00:40,208
ONLY ONE TEAM STANDS
IN THEIR WAY--THE WOLF-BATS.

14
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:41,667
LED BY TEAM CAPTAIN TAHNO,

15
00:00:41,709 --> 00:00:43,750
THE BRUTAL WOLF-BATS
LOOK TO REPEAT AS CHAMPS.

16
00:00:43,792 --> 00:00:46,291
HAVE THE FIRE FERRETS
FINALLY MET THEIR MATCH?

17
00:01:02,375 --> 00:01:05,125
- [radio DJ] YOU ARE
LISTENING TO THE MUSIC HOUR.
- YES! WHOO!

18
00:01:05,166 --> 00:01:07,709
- [radio DJ] BROUGHT
TO YOU BY CABBAGE CORP.

19
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:12,333
REPUBLIC CITY'S TRUSTED NAME IN
TECHNOLOGY FOR OVER FIFTY YEARS.

20
00:01:12,375 --> 00:01:13,959
- MAN, I GOT A GOOD FEELING
ABOUT TONIGHT!

21
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,375
I DON'T CARE
IF WE ARE THE UNDERDOGS,

22
00:01:15,417 --> 00:01:17,792
WE CAN TAKE THOSE
POMPOUS WOLF-BATS.

23
00:01:17,834 --> 00:01:19,375
- IT'S GOING TO BE
OUR TOUGHEST MATCH EVER,

24
00:01:19,417 --> 00:01:20,959
BUT I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT.

25
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,125
- INTRODUCING
YOUR NEW CHAMPS,

26
00:01:23,166 --> 00:01:27,625
THE FANTASTIC FIRE FERRETS!

27
00:01:27,667 --> 00:01:30,709
- [on radio] GOOD MORNING,
CITIZENS OF REPUBLIC CITY.

28
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:32,083
THIS IS AMON.

29
00:01:32,125 --> 00:01:33,417
I HOPE YOU ALL ENJOYED

30
00:01:33,458 --> 00:01:36,125
LAST NIGHT'S
PRO BENDING MATCH,

31
00:01:36,166 --> 00:01:38,917
BECAUSE IT WILL
BE THE LAST.

32
00:01:38,959 --> 00:01:42,458
IT'S TIME FOR THIS CITY TO STOP
WORSHIPPING BENDING ATHLETES

33
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:44,959
AS IF THEY WERE HEROES.

34
00:01:45,041 --> 00:01:48,709
I AM CALLING ON THE COUNCIL
TO SHUT DOWN THE BENDING ARENA

35
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:52,125
AND CANCEL THE FINALS
OR ELSE...

36
00:01:52,166 --> 00:01:55,000
THERE WILL BE SEVERE
CONSEQUENCES.

37
00:01:55,041 --> 00:01:55,917
[radio static]

38
00:01:55,959 --> 00:01:57,417
- THAT GUY'S GOT SOME NERVE!

39
00:01:57,458 --> 00:01:59,208
- YOU THINK THE COUNCIL
WILL GIVE IN?

40
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:01,834
- I'M NOT WAITING TO FIND OUT.
WE NEED TO GET TO CITY HALL.

41
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:12,166
- KORRA, YOU SHOULDN'T BE HERE.
THIS IS A CLOSED MEETING.

42
00:02:12,208 --> 00:02:14,083
- AS THE AVATAR,
AND A PRO BENDING PLAYER,

43
00:02:14,125 --> 00:02:17,208
I HAVE A RIGHT TO BE HEARD.
YOU CAN'T CANCEL THE FINALS.

44
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:19,792
- I KNOW WINNING THE
CHAMPIONSHIP MEANS A LOT TO YOU,

45
00:02:19,834 --> 00:02:23,041
BUT AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED,
WE NEED TO SHUT THE ARENA DOWN.

46
00:02:23,083 --> 00:02:25,000
- WHAT ABOUT
THE REST OF YOU?

47
00:02:25,041 --> 00:02:27,417
TARRLOK, THERE'S NO WAY YOU'RE
BACKING DOWN FROM AMON, RIGHT?

48
00:02:27,458 --> 00:02:30,959
- ACTUALLY, TENZIN
AND I AGREE, FOR ONCE.

49
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,875
- THE COUNCIL IS UNANIMOUS--
WE'RE CLOSING THE ARENA.

50
00:02:33,917 --> 00:02:35,250
- NO!
- YOU CAN'T!

51
00:02:35,291 --> 00:02:36,917
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

52
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:40,083
I THOUGHT YOU OF ALL PEOPLE
WOULD TAKE A STAND AGAINST AMON.

53
00:02:40,125 --> 00:02:41,709
- WHILE I AM STILL
COMMITTED TO BRINGING

54
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:45,291
THAT LUNATIC TO JUSTICE,
I WILL NOT PUT INNOCENT LIVES

55
00:02:45,333 --> 00:02:49,542
AT STAKE JUST SO YOU AND
YOUR FRIENDS CAN PLAY A GAME.

56
00:02:49,583 --> 00:02:52,375
- PRO BENDING MIGHT
ONLY BE A GAME TO YOU,

57
00:02:52,417 --> 00:02:54,000
BUT THINK OF WHAT
IT MEANS TO THE CITY.

58
00:02:54,041 --> 00:02:55,917
RIGHT NOW THE ARENA
IS THE ONE PLACE

59
00:02:55,959 --> 00:03:00,375
WHERE BENDERS AND NON-BENDERS
GATHER TOGETHER IN PEACE...

60
00:03:00,417 --> 00:03:02,166
TO WATCH BENDERS...

61
00:03:02,208 --> 00:03:06,625
- BEAT EACH OTHER UP--IN PEACE!
IT'S AN INSPIRATION TO EVERYONE!

62
00:03:06,667 --> 00:03:09,166
- I APPRECIATE
YOUR NAIVE IDEALISM,

63
00:03:09,208 --> 00:03:11,875
BUT YOU'RE IGNORING
THE REALITY OF THE SITUATION.

64
00:03:11,917 --> 00:03:15,417
- THE REALITY IS, IF YOU CLOSE
THE ARENA, YOU LET AMON WIN!

65
00:03:15,458 --> 00:03:18,125
- YES, EXACTLY WHAT SHE SAID!
YES.

66
00:03:18,166 --> 00:03:21,166
- I'M SORRY, BUT OUR DECISION
HAS BEEN MADE.

67
00:03:21,208 --> 00:03:24,458
THIS MEETING IS ADJOURNED.

68
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:28,208
[gasps]

69
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:30,083
- I CAN'T BELIEVE
I'M SAYING THIS,

70
00:03:30,125 --> 00:03:32,041
BUT I AGREE WITH THE AVATAR.

71
00:03:32,083 --> 00:03:34,500
- YOU DO?
- YEAH, YOU DO?

72
00:03:34,542 --> 00:03:36,583
- I EXPECTED THIS KIND
OF CUT AND RUN

73
00:03:36,625 --> 00:03:39,542
RESPONSE FROM TENZIN,
BUT THE REST OF YOU?

74
00:03:39,583 --> 00:03:42,250
COME ON, SHOW
A LITTLE MORE BACKBONE.

75
00:03:42,291 --> 00:03:44,500
IT'S TIME THAT THE BENDERS
OF THIS CITY

76
00:03:44,542 --> 00:03:46,625
DISPLAYED
SOME STRENGTH AND UNITY

77
00:03:46,667 --> 00:03:48,458
AGAINST THESE EQUALISTS.

78
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:51,417
- WE MUST PREVENT THE CONFLICT
BETWEEN BENDERS AND NON-BENDERS

79
00:03:51,458 --> 00:03:53,709
FROM ESCALATING
INTO ALL-OUT WAR!

80
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:56,500
THE COUNCIL IS NOT CHANGING
ITS POSITION, LIN.

81
00:03:56,542 --> 00:03:58,750
- NOW, JUST A MOMENT, TENZIN.

82
00:03:58,792 --> 00:04:02,583
LET US HEAR WHAT OUR ESTEEMED
CHIEF OF POLICE HAS IN MIND.

83
00:04:02,625 --> 00:04:04,166
- HMM.

84
00:04:04,208 --> 00:04:06,792
- IF YOU KEEP THE ARENA OPEN,
MY METALBENDERS AND I

85
00:04:06,834 --> 00:04:10,291
WILL PROVIDE EXTRA SECURITY
DURING THE CHAMPIONSHIP MATCH.

86
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:12,458
THERE'S NO BETTER FORCE
TO DEAL WITH THE CHI-BLOCKERS.

87
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:15,417
OUR ARMOR IS IMPERVIOUS
TO THEIR ATTACKS.

88
00:04:15,458 --> 00:04:18,750
- ARE YOU SAYING THAT YOU WILL
PERSONALLY TAKE RESPONSIBILITY

89
00:04:18,792 --> 00:04:21,500
FOR THE SAFETY
OF THE SPECTATORS IN THE ARENA?

90
00:04:21,542 --> 00:04:23,291
- I GUARANTEE IT.

91
00:04:23,333 --> 00:04:27,375
- IT IS HARD TO ARGUE WITH
CHIEF BEIFONG'S TRACK RECORD.

92
00:04:27,417 --> 00:04:29,834
IF SHE IS CONFIDENT
HER ELITE OFFICERS CAN

93
00:04:29,875 --> 00:04:33,125
PROTECT THE ARENA,
THEN SHE HAS MY SUPPORT.

94
00:04:33,166 --> 00:04:36,250
I AM CHANGING MY VOTE--
WHO ELSE IS WITH ME?

95
00:04:39,291 --> 00:04:42,375
THE ARENA STAYS OPEN.
GOOD LUCK IN THE FINALS.

96
00:04:42,417 --> 00:04:43,458
- ALL RIGHT!
- YEAH!

97
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:44,667
- THANK YOU!

98
00:04:44,709 --> 00:04:49,083
- AND GOOD LUCK TO YOU,
CHIEF BEIFONG.

99
00:04:49,125 --> 00:04:52,458
- A WORD, PLEASE, LIN.

100
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:53,792
TARRLOK'S PLAYING YOU.

101
00:04:53,834 --> 00:04:55,583
AND I DON'T WANT
TO SEE YOU GET HURT.

102
00:04:55,625 --> 00:04:57,959
- I KNOW WHAT I'M DOING AND
THE RISKS THAT COME WITH IT.

103
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,542
- IN THAT CASE, I'M GOING TO BE
BY YOUR SIDE DURING THE MATCH.

104
00:05:00,583 --> 00:05:02,875
- YOU DON'T NEED
TO BABYSIT ME.

105
00:05:02,917 --> 00:05:05,917
- IT'S FOR KORRA.
I WANT TO MAKE SURE SHE'S SAFE.

106
00:05:05,959 --> 00:05:07,917
- DO WHAT YOU WANT.

107
00:05:07,959 --> 00:05:09,792
IT'S NOT LIKE I'VE EVER
BEEN ABLE TO STOP YOU BEFORE.

108
00:05:09,834 --> 00:05:11,375
- EXCUSE ME, CHIEF BEIFONG?

109
00:05:11,417 --> 00:05:12,917
I WANTED TO THANK YOU
FOR YOUR HELP.

110
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:16,792
IT REALLY MEANS...A LOT.

111
00:05:16,834 --> 00:05:18,333
WHAT IS HER DEAL?

112
00:05:18,375 --> 00:05:20,625
EVEN WHEN SHE'S
ON MY SIDE SHE'S AGAINST ME.

113
00:05:20,667 --> 00:05:22,625
- I'VE KNOWN LIN
SINCE WE WERE CHILDREN.

114
00:05:22,667 --> 00:05:26,166
SHE'S ALWAYS BEEN...
CHALLENGING.

115
00:05:26,208 --> 00:05:27,583
- WHAT DID YOUR FATHER DO
TO MAKE HER

116
00:05:27,625 --> 00:05:29,625
HATE THE AVATAR SO MUCH?

117
00:05:29,667 --> 00:05:32,041
- MY FATHER AND LIN
GOT ALONG FAMOUSLY.

118
00:05:32,083 --> 00:05:36,166
I'M AFRAID HER ISSUES
ARE WITH ME.

119
00:05:36,208 --> 00:05:39,166
- WAIT A SECOND.
IT ALL MAKES SENSE NOW!

120
00:05:39,208 --> 00:05:41,709
YOU AND BEIFONG,
BEIFONG AND YOU.

121
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:43,125
YOU TWO WERE A COUPLE!

122
00:05:43,166 --> 00:05:45,750
- WHAT? HOW...
WHERE'D YOU GET THAT IDEA?

123
00:05:45,792 --> 00:05:47,875
- HA! YOUR WIFE.

124
00:05:47,917 --> 00:05:50,417
- CRIMINY! I'LL HAVE
TO HAVE A WORD WITH HER...

125
00:05:50,458 --> 00:05:54,667
- SO PEMA STOLE YOU
FROM BEIFONG?

126
00:05:54,709 --> 00:05:56,625
I'M SURPRISED
OUR "ESTEEMED CHIEF OF POLICE"

127
00:05:56,667 --> 00:05:58,250
DIDN'T THROW HER IN JAIL.

128
00:05:58,291 --> 00:06:01,250
- OH, SHE TRIED.
ANYWAY, PEMA DIDN'T "STEAL" ME.

129
00:06:01,291 --> 00:06:04,458
LIN AND I HAD BEEN GROWING APART
FOR SOME TIME.

130
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:07,750
WE BOTH HAD DIFFERENT GOALS
IN LIFE--

131
00:06:07,792 --> 00:06:09,792
WHY AM I EVEN
TELLING YOU THIS?

132
00:06:09,834 --> 00:06:13,834
IT ALL HAPPENED A LONG TIME AGO,
AND WE'VE MOVED PAST IT.

133
00:06:13,875 --> 00:06:15,458
- APPARENTLY BEIFONG HASN'T.

134
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:18,583
- WHAT DO YOU...?
OF COURSE SHE HAS.

135
00:06:18,625 --> 00:06:20,667
ANYWAY, THIS IS NONE
OF YOUR BUSINESS!

136
00:06:20,709 --> 00:06:23,125
- SEE YOU AT HOME,
MISTER HEARTBREAKER!

137
00:06:23,166 --> 00:06:24,208
[laughs]

138
00:06:32,792 --> 00:06:36,750
- I JUST GOT WORD.
THE COUNCIL DEFIED YOUR THREAT.

139
00:06:36,792 --> 00:06:39,917
THEY'RE KEEPING THE ARENA OPEN.
- PERFECT.

140
00:06:39,959 --> 00:06:43,125
EVERYTHING IS GOING
ACCORDING TO PLAN.

141
00:07:05,917 --> 00:07:10,583
- ALL CLEAR, CHIEF.

142
00:07:10,625 --> 00:07:12,166
- HOW IS THE SECURITY
SWEEP GOING?

143
00:07:12,208 --> 00:07:13,458
- FINE.

144
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:14,458
- THEY'VE CHECKED
UNDERNEATH THE STANDS?

145
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:15,625
- YES.

146
00:07:15,667 --> 00:07:16,875
- AND YOU HAVE ENOUGH
OFFICERS TO COVER

147
00:07:16,917 --> 00:07:18,375
ALL POINTS OF ENTRY?

148
00:07:18,417 --> 00:07:20,458
- I HAVE THE SKIES, THE BAY,
AND EVERY NOOK AND CRANNY

149
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:21,792
OF THIS PLACE COVERED.

150
00:07:21,834 --> 00:07:24,542
NOW LEAVE ME ALONE
AND LET ME DO MY JOB.

151
00:07:24,583 --> 00:07:27,458
- LIN, WITH SO MUCH ON THE LINE,
IT WOULD BE NICE

152
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:29,417
IF WE COULD
HELP EACH OTHER OUT,

153
00:07:29,458 --> 00:07:32,583
AT LEAST FOR ONE NIGHT.

154
00:07:32,625 --> 00:07:36,667
- LIKE OLD TIMES?
- LIKE OLD TIMES.

155
00:07:36,709 --> 00:07:40,291
- OKAY, I'LL TRY
TO BE LESS ABRASIVE THAN USUAL.

156
00:07:40,333 --> 00:07:43,250
- I WOULD APPRECIATE THAT.

157
00:07:46,125 --> 00:07:48,375
- THE ANTICIPATION IS PALPABLE
AS WE ARE JUST MOMENTS AWAY

158
00:07:48,417 --> 00:07:50,166
FROM THE
CHAMPIONSHIP MATCH.

159
00:07:50,208 --> 00:07:53,333
WILL THE WOLF-BATS' FEROCITY
HELP THEM REPEAT AS CHAMPS,

160
00:07:53,375 --> 00:07:55,166
OR WILL THE UNDERDOG
FIRE FERRETS

161
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:59,166
SERVE UP A SURPRISING BOWL
OF SMACKDOWN SOUP?

162
00:07:59,208 --> 00:08:01,792
- NOW I KNOW THERE'S A BIG
CROWD, BUT DON'T BE NERVOUS.

163
00:08:01,834 --> 00:08:03,000
YOU'RE GONNA DO GREAT.

164
00:08:03,041 --> 00:08:03,959
I BELIEVE IN YOU.

165
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,875
- [chirping]

166
00:08:09,583 --> 00:08:12,709
[cheers and applause]

167
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:15,667
- INTRODUCING THE CHALLENGERS,

168
00:08:15,709 --> 00:08:20,166
THE FUTURE INDUSTRIES
FIRE FERRETS!

169

[cheers and applause]

170
00:08:29,792 --> 00:08:31,333
- MWAH.

171
00:08:32,542 --> 00:08:35,208
- MWAH.
- UGH.

172
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:41,333
[cheers and applause]

173
00:08:43,166 --> 00:08:45,959
- YOU'RE ON, PABU!

174
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,834
- [chirping]

175
00:08:51,792 --> 00:08:56,000
- YES! NAILED IT!
HE'S SO TALENTED.

176
00:08:56,041 --> 00:08:57,959
- AND THEIR OPPONENTS--

177
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,333
THE THREE-TIME
DEFENDING CHAMPIONS,

178
00:09:01,375 --> 00:09:04,166
THE WHITE FALLS WOLF-BATS!

179
00:09:07,291 --> 00:09:10,500
[howling]

180
00:09:15,542 --> 00:09:16,959
- [howls]

181
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,917
[booing]

182
00:09:19,959 --> 00:09:24,500
- THEY GOT NOTHING ON US, BUDDY.
ANYBODY CAN HOWL--OOH!

183
00:09:24,542 --> 00:09:27,208
- [chirps]
- WHATEVER.

184
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:34,917
- I'M GONNA KNOCK TAHNO'S
STUPID HAIR OFF HIS STUPID HEAD.

185
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:37,500
- THE CHAMPS AND CHALLENGERS
FACE OFF AT THE CENTER LINE.

186
00:09:37,542 --> 00:09:40,166
AND HERE WE GO!
[bell rings]

187
00:09:43,125 --> 00:09:44,500
TAHNO TRIES TO CLEAN

188
00:09:44,542 --> 00:09:47,333
THE AVATAR'S CLOCK WITH
SOME DIRTY WATER-BOXING!

189
00:09:47,375 --> 00:09:49,959
MING SHAKES OFF MAKO'S ATTACK
AND RETURNS THE FAVOR.

190
00:09:53,208 --> 00:09:56,500
[buzzer buzzes]

191
00:09:56,542 --> 00:09:59,583
SHAOZU GETS FANCY BUT BOLIN
RICOCHETS A DISK OFF THE ROPES

192
00:09:59,625 --> 00:10:01,000
AND SAYS,
"NO, THANK YOU, SIR!”

193
00:10:01,041 --> 00:10:02,000
[cheers and applause]

194
00:10:02,041 --> 00:10:05,875
- NICE SHOT!

195
00:10:05,917 --> 00:10:09,709
- THE WATERBENDERS SLUG IT OUT,
LOOKING EVENLY MATCHED.

196
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:11,458
TAHNO GETS A LITTLE
TOO WORKED UP AND UNLEASHES

197
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:13,792
A DELUGE ON BOLIN THAT WILL
CERTAINLY ELICIT A FOUL.

198
00:10:13,834 --> 00:10:14,959
[buzzer buzzes]

199
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,542
OR APPARENTLY NOT!
[crowd booing]

200
00:10:16,583 --> 00:10:19,542
- WHAT'S THE BIG IDEA, REF?
THAT WAS A HOSING FOUL!

201
00:10:19,583 --> 00:10:21,792
- AND THE WOLF-BATS ADVANCE
DESPITE TAHNO EXCEEDING

202
00:10:21,834 --> 00:10:23,333
THE WATERBENDING TIME LIMIT.

203
00:10:23,375 --> 00:10:26,834
A QUESTIONABLE CALL
BY THE OFFICIALS.

204
00:10:26,875 --> 00:10:29,333
MING TRIPS UP MAKO
WITH ANOTHER DIRTY TRICK!

205
00:10:29,375 --> 00:10:31,166
[buzzer buzzes]
- OH, COME ON, REFS!

206
00:10:31,208 --> 00:10:33,291
THERE WAS SOME FUNNY BUSINESS
IN THAT LAST PLAY!

207
00:10:33,333 --> 00:10:35,583
- WOULDN'T HAVE GUESSED YOU
KNEW THE RULES OF PRO BENDING.

208
00:10:35,625 --> 00:10:37,375
- AHEM, I'VE BEEN BRUSHING UP.

209
00:10:37,417 --> 00:10:40,583
THAT WOLF-BAT BLATANTLY BENT
A DISK OUTSIDE OF HIS ZONE.

210
00:10:40,625 --> 00:10:42,250
- THE FERRET BROTHERS
ARE BACKED UP TO ZONE THREE,

211
00:10:42,291 --> 00:10:46,166
AND THE WOLF-BATS
SMELL BLOOD.

212
00:10:46,208 --> 00:10:49,750
- YAAGH!

213
00:10:49,792 --> 00:10:52,458
- LOOKS LIKE TAHNO SNUCK IN
AN ILLEGAL ICING MOVE,

214
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:54,250
BUT ONCE AGAIN
THERE'S NO CALL.

215
00:10:54,291 --> 00:10:56,125
I DON'T KNOW WHAT MATCH
THE REFS ARE WATCHING,

216
00:10:56,166 --> 00:11:00,250
BUT IT'S OBVIOUSLY
NOT THIS ONE.

217
00:11:00,291 --> 00:11:01,000
- OOH! UNH!
- OOH!

218
00:11:01,041 --> 00:11:03,000
[buzzer buzzes]

219
00:11:03,041 --> 00:11:05,959
- A SPLASH AND CRASH SEND THE
AVATAR TO ZONE THREE AS WELL!

220
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,041
[bell rings]

221
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:08,250
IT'S A KNOCKOUT!

222
00:11:08,291 --> 00:11:09,709
THE WOLF-BATS
WIN THE CHAMPIONSHIP

223
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:13,667
FOR THE FOURTH YEAR IN A--
HOLD ON A SECOND, FOLKS!

224
00:11:13,709 --> 00:11:15,500
SCRATCH THAT.
THE FERRETS ARE STILL ALIVE!

225
00:11:15,542 --> 00:11:18,000
BUT JUST BARELY!

226
00:11:18,041 --> 00:11:19,250
- UNH!

227
00:11:21,166 --> 00:11:24,208
UNH!

228
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:27,291
- OOF!
[buzzer buzzes]

229
00:11:27,333 --> 00:11:28,917
- WHAT AN UNBELIEVABLE MOVE!

230
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:30,875
THESE FERRETS AREN'T
JUST BENDING THE ELEMENTS,

231
00:11:30,917 --> 00:11:32,750
THEY'RE BENDING MY MIND!

232
00:11:32,792 --> 00:11:34,333
THE UNDERDOGS SURVIVE
TO SEE ROUND TWO!

233
00:11:34,375 --> 00:11:36,291
- [growls]

234
00:11:38,417 --> 00:11:40,083
- WHAT'S WRONG WITH THESE REFS?

235
00:11:40,125 --> 00:11:42,083
- THEY'VE BEEN PAID OFF.
IT'S THE ONLY EXPLANATION.

236
00:11:42,125 --> 00:11:44,000
SOMEONE WANTS US TO LOSE.

237
00:11:44,041 --> 00:11:46,583
- IF THE WOLF-BATS ARE GOING TO
FIGHT DIRTY, THEN SO SHOULD WE.

238
00:11:46,625 --> 00:11:49,291
- NO, WE CAN'T.
THE REFS HAVE IT OUT FOR US.

239
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:50,542
IF WE'RE GOING
TO WIN THIS THING,

240
00:11:50,583 --> 00:11:52,125
IT HAS TO BE FAIR AND SQUARE.

241
00:11:52,166 --> 00:11:55,875
- UGH, THAT'S NO FUN,
BUT ALL RIGHT.

242
00:11:55,917 --> 00:12:00,625
- ROUND TWO!
[bell rings]

243
00:12:00,667 --> 00:12:02,166
- THE OPENING SALVO
IS A BRUTAL BRAWL

244
00:12:02,208 --> 00:12:04,250
AS BOTH SIDES
GIVE IT THEIR ALL!

245
00:12:04,291 --> 00:12:06,250
BUT ONCE AGAIN TAHNO
SNEAKS IN A LITTLE ICE

246
00:12:06,291 --> 00:12:09,208
TO GET THE UPPER HAND.

247
00:12:11,166 --> 00:12:15,250
WOWZA, THOSE LOOK LIKE
ILLEGAL HEADSHOTS TO ME!

248
00:12:15,291 --> 00:12:16,709
[bell rings]

249
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:19,959
- ROUND TWO WILL BE DECIDED
WITH A TIEBREAKER!

250
00:12:24,458 --> 00:12:27,625
- THE FIRE FERRETS
WIN THE COIN TOSS!

251
00:12:27,667 --> 00:12:29,625
WHICH ELEMENT
DO YOU CHOOSE?

252
00:12:29,667 --> 00:12:31,208
- I'M TAKING THIS ONE.

253
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:33,542
LET'S GO.
YOU AND ME, PRETTY BOY.

254
00:12:33,583 --> 00:12:36,250
- I THOUGHT YOU'D NEVER ASK.

255
00:12:46,583 --> 00:12:49,875
COME ON, LITTLE GIRL.
GIVE ME YOUR BEST SHOT.

256
00:12:53,083 --> 00:12:55,041
UNH!

257
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:01,291
UNH!

258
00:13:01,333 --> 00:13:02,792
[bell rings]

259
00:13:02,834 --> 00:13:04,583
- HMM. CHUMP.

260
00:13:04,625 --> 00:13:08,834
[cheers and applause]

261
00:13:08,875 --> 00:13:11,792
- ROUND TWO GOES
TO THE FIRE FERRETS!

262
00:13:14,875 --> 00:13:16,291
- NICE ONE!

263
00:13:16,333 --> 00:13:19,500
- THAT'S THE STUFF!
YOU ARE MY HERO! AAH!

264
00:13:19,542 --> 00:13:22,208
- WE MIGHT ACTUALLY
WIN THIS THING!

265
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:23,709
- AARRGHH!

266
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:27,166
LET'S SEND THEM
TO A WATERY GRAVE.

267
00:13:27,208 --> 00:13:28,959
- I CAN'T BELIEVE YOUR
SWEET-TEMPERED FATHER

268
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,208
WAS REINCARNATED
INTO THAT GIRL.

269
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:32,709
SHE'S TOUGH AS NAILS.

270
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:34,875
- REMINDS ME OF SOMEONE ELSE
I KNEW AT THAT AGE.

271
00:13:34,917 --> 00:13:36,250
YOU TWO MIGHT GET ALONG,

272
00:13:36,291 --> 00:13:38,333
IF YOU WOULD ONLY
GIVE HER A CHANCE.

273
00:13:38,375 --> 00:13:39,959
- HUMPH!

274
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,333
- ONE ROUND A PIECE!
WHO WANTS IT MORE?

275
00:13:42,375 --> 00:13:44,625
[bell dings]

276
00:13:44,667 --> 00:13:45,917
THE WOLF-BATS
FLY OUT OF THE GATE,

277
00:13:45,959 --> 00:13:47,625
SWINGING WITH BAD INTENTIONS.

278
00:13:47,667 --> 00:13:49,250
THE CHALLENGERS ARE SHOWING
A LOT OF HEART,

279
00:13:49,291 --> 00:13:50,500
BUT THE CHAMPS
ARE REALLY STARTING

280
00:13:50,542 --> 00:13:52,291
TO FIND THEIR RHYTHM NOW.

281
00:13:52,333 --> 00:13:54,000
CAN THE FERRETS
HANG IN THERE WITH THE BEST,

282
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:56,250
ESPECIALLY WHEN
THE BEST ARE FRANKLY

283
00:13:56,291 --> 00:13:58,208
GETTING A LITTLE HELP
FROM THE REFS?

284
00:13:58,250 --> 00:14:01,875
IT'S ALL DOWN
TO THIS FINAL ROUND!

285
00:14:01,917 --> 00:14:03,834
MAKO IS LEAVING
IT ALL IN THE RING,

286
00:14:03,875 --> 00:14:05,166
BUT IT LOOKS
LIKE TAHNO AND MING

287
00:14:05,208 --> 00:14:08,959
ARE UP TO MORE SHENANIGANS!

288
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,458
[buzzer buzzes]

289
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:16,125
OH, THIS HAS GONE TOO FAR!
THAT WATER HAD ROCKS IN IT!

290
00:14:16,166 --> 00:14:17,709
- KNOCKOUT!
[bell dings]

291
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:19,709
- OH, COME ON!
THOSE WERE ILLEGAL HEADSHOTS!

292
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:21,458
OPEN YOUR EYES, REF!

293
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:23,041
- WELL FOLKS,
IT'S A CONTROVERSIAL CALL,

294
00:14:23,083 --> 00:14:26,375
BUT THE WOLF-BATS NOTCH A NASTY
KNOCKOUT TO WIN THE MATCH!

295
00:14:26,417 --> 00:14:28,458
FOR THE FOURTH YEAR
IN A ROW THEY'LL BE CROWNED

296
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:31,083
TOURNAMENT CHAMPIONS!

297
00:14:31,125 --> 00:14:33,083
- I BARELY BROKE A SWEAT.

298
00:14:33,125 --> 00:14:36,792
ANYBODY ELSE WANNA SCRAP
WITH THE CHAMPS?

299
00:15:04,291 --> 00:15:05,375
- LOOK OUT!

300
00:15:05,417 --> 00:15:06,542
- AARRGHH!
[electricity crackling]

301
00:15:06,583 --> 00:15:08,125
- AARRGHH!
[pained groan]

00:15:13,458 --> 00:15:14,375
- AARRGHH!
[pained groan]

304

[electricity crackling]

307
00:15:26,625 --> 00:15:29,125
- WHAT...?

308
00:15:29,166 --> 00:15:30,125
[gasps]

309
00:15:30,166 --> 00:15:33,250
[electricity crackling]

310
00:15:33,291 --> 00:15:36,208
[screaming]

311
00:15:38,458 --> 00:15:40,041
- FOLKS, THERE IS SOME SORT
OF ELECTRICAL DISTURBANCE

312
00:15:40,083 --> 00:15:41,625
IN THE STANDS.

313
00:15:41,667 --> 00:15:44,375
METALBENDER COPS
ARE DROPPING LIKE BUMBLE-FLIES!

314
00:15:44,417 --> 00:15:46,542
THERE APPEAR TO BE
MASKED MEMBERS OF THE AUDIENCE

315
00:15:46,583 --> 00:15:50,834
WIELDING STRANGE DEVICES
ON THEIR HANDS.

316
00:15:50,875 --> 00:15:53,583
ONE OF THEM IS IN THE BOOTH
WITH ME RIGHT NOW, FOLKS.

317
00:15:53,625 --> 00:15:56,000
HE IS LEVELING ONE OF THOSE
GLOVE DEVICES AT ME NOW,

318
00:15:56,041 --> 00:15:58,750
AND I BELIEVE HE
IS ABOUT TO ELECTROCUTE ME.

319
00:15:58,792 --> 00:16:00,917
I AM CURRENTLY
WETTING MY PANTS.

320
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:02,083
[electricity crackling]

321
00:16:19,375 --> 00:16:23,166
[crowd screaming]

322
00:16:26,792 --> 00:16:29,208
- WHAT'S GOING ON HERE, REF?
- I DON'T KNOW!

323
00:16:31,792 --> 00:16:35,083
- ALL RIGHT, YOU WANT
A PIECE OF THE WOLF-BATS?

324
00:16:35,125 --> 00:16:38,250
HERE IT COMES!

325
00:16:43,542 --> 00:16:46,417
- HUNH! AAAAH!

326
00:16:46,458 --> 00:16:49,208
- RRRAH!
- UNH!

327
00:16:53,208 --> 00:16:55,083
WAIT, PLEASE DON'T DO THIS!

328
00:16:55,125 --> 00:16:56,250
I'LL GIVE YOU
THE CHAMPIONSHIP POT!

329
00:16:56,291 --> 00:16:57,667
I'LL GIVE YOU EVERYTHING,

330
00:16:57,709 --> 00:17:00,417
JUST PLEASE DON'T
TAKE MY BENDING!

331
00:17:03,709 --> 00:17:06,375
[gasps]

332
00:17:22,792 --> 00:17:24,500
- [groans]

333
00:17:34,709 --> 00:17:36,458
- I BELIEVE
I HAVE YOUR ATTENTION,

334
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:38,667
BENDERS OF REPUBLIC CITY.

335
00:17:38,709 --> 00:17:43,458
SO ONCE AGAIN THE WOLF-BATS
ARE YOUR PRO BENDING CHAMPIONS.

336
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:46,000
IT SEEMS FITTING THAT
YOU CELEBRATE THREE BULLIES

337
00:17:46,041 --> 00:17:48,458
WHO CHEATED
THEIR WAY TO VICTORY.

338
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:51,041
BECAUSE EVERY DAY
YOU THREATEN AND ABUSE

339
00:17:51,083 --> 00:17:54,166
YOUR FELLOW NON-BENDING
CITIZENS, JUST LIKE

340
00:17:54,208 --> 00:17:58,458
THE WOLF-BATS DID
TO THEIR OPPONENTS TONIGHT.

341
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:02,875
THOSE MEN WERE SUPPOSEDLY
THE BEST IN THE BENDING WORLD.

342
00:18:02,917 --> 00:18:05,667
AND YET IT ONLY TOOK
A FEW MOMENTS FOR ME

343
00:18:05,709 --> 00:18:08,709
TO CLEANSE THEM
OF THEIR IMPURITY.

344
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:12,959
LET THIS BE A WARNING TO ALL
OF YOU BENDERS OUT THERE--

345
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:17,291
IF ANY OF YOU STAND IN MY WAY,
YOU WILL MEET THE SAME FATE.

346
00:18:17,333 --> 00:18:18,667
[crowd gasps]

347
00:18:18,709 --> 00:18:21,709
NOW, TO MY FOLLOWERS.

348
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:24,208
FOR YEARS, THE EQUALISTS
HAVE BEEN FORCED

349
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:26,709
TO HIDE IN THE SHADOWS.

350
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:30,667
BUT NOW, WE HAVE
THE NUMBERS AND THE STRENGTH

351
00:18:30,709 --> 00:18:34,208
TO CREATE A
NEW REPUBLIC CITY.

352
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:36,166
I'M HAPPY
TO TELL YOU THAT

353
00:18:36,208 --> 00:18:39,625
THE TIME FOR CHANGE
HAS FINALLY COME.
- HOW ARE WE GONNA
GET OUT OF HERE?

354
00:18:39,667 --> 00:18:44,166
- VERY SOON THE CURRENT
TYRANNICAL BENDING REGIME...
- PABU!
LISTEN UP, BUDDY.

355
00:18:44,208 --> 00:18:47,875
- ...REPLACED BY A FAIR-MINDED
EQUALIST GOVERNMENT...

356
00:18:47,917 --> 00:18:49,542
- STOP FOOLING AROUND!

357
00:18:49,583 --> 00:18:53,625
- I'M NOT.
I'M TRYING TO SAVE US!

358
00:18:53,667 --> 00:18:57,375
- IT'S TIME TO
TAKE BACK OUR CITY.
- SEE? PABU'S NOT JUST
A ONE-TRICK POODLE-PONY.

359
00:18:57,417 --> 00:18:59,792
- FOR CENTURIES,
BENDERS HAVE POSSESSED

360
00:18:59,834 --> 00:19:03,667
AN UNNATURAL ADVANTAGE
OVER ORDINARY PEOPLE.

361
00:19:03,709 --> 00:19:06,709
BUT THANKFULLY MODERN
TECHNOLOGY HAS PROVIDED US

362
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:10,000
WITH A WAY TO EVEN OUT
THE PLAYING FIELD.

363
00:19:10,041 --> 00:19:14,667
NOW ANYONE CAN HOLD THE POWER
OF A CHI-BLOCKER IN THEIR HAND.

364
00:19:14,709 --> 00:19:17,458
MY FOLLOWERS AND I
WILL NOT REST UNTIL

365
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:20,750
THE ENTIRE CITY
ACHIEVES EQUALITY.

366
00:19:20,792 --> 00:19:25,125
AND ONCE THAT GOAL IS ACHIEVED,
WE WILL EQUALIZE

367
00:19:25,166 --> 00:19:27,000
THE REST THE WORLD.

368
00:19:27,041 --> 00:19:30,917
THE REVOLUTION HAS BEGUN!

369
00:19:36,083 --> 00:19:39,500
[glass shattering]

370
00:19:50,417 --> 00:19:51,917
- [moans]

371
00:19:51,959 --> 00:19:54,625
- [groans]

372
00:19:54,667 --> 00:19:56,917
- TENZIN!

373
00:20:04,792 --> 00:20:06,875
- IT'S OKAY, PABU,
JUST A LITTLE EXPLOSION!

374
00:20:06,917 --> 00:20:08,667
[chomping noises]

375
00:20:08,709 --> 00:20:09,875
KEEP CHEWING.
YOU'RE ALMOST THROUGH IT!

376
00:20:09,917 --> 00:20:12,375
- [chirping]

377
00:20:12,417 --> 00:20:16,834
- YES!
GREAT JOB, BUDDY!

378
00:20:16,875 --> 00:20:18,834
- I'M GOING AFTER AMON!
- BE CAREFUL!

379
00:20:18,875 --> 00:20:20,375
[crowd screaming]

380
00:20:32,667 --> 00:20:34,917
- [screams]

381
00:21:00,709 --> 00:21:02,750
YAAAH!

382
00:21:15,625 --> 00:21:17,000
- HUNH!

383
00:21:17,041 --> 00:21:18,750
RRAHH!

384
00:21:25,959 --> 00:21:29,250
- AAH! UNH!

385
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:34,917
- UNH!

386
00:21:36,166 --> 00:21:38,208
- HUA! OOF!

387
00:22:30,083 --> 00:22:32,125
- [screams]

388
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,792
UNH!

389
00:22:54,709 --> 00:22:57,959
- YOU ALRIGHT?
- I'M FINE--THANKS TO YOU.

390
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,291
- DON'T MENTION IT, KID.

391
00:23:00,333 --> 00:23:04,458
LOOKS LIKE
WE LOST THIS ONE.

392
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:07,375
- I'M SO GLAD YOU'RE OKAY.
- ME TOO.

393
00:23:09,792 --> 00:23:14,041
- I CAN'T BELIEVE AMON DID THIS.
I PLAYED RIGHT INTO HIS HAND.

394
00:23:14,083 --> 00:23:17,750
- HE PLAYED US ALL.
REPUBLIC CITY IS AT WAR.
