[elevator dings]
- YEAH, I'M NOT INTERESTED.

175
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:29,959
- OH, YOU WILL BE.

176
00:09:31,834 --> 00:09:33,208
[elevator dings]

177
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:35,250
SO WHILE YOUR HANDS SOAK
IN A BUBBLING MILK BATH,

178
00:09:35,291 --> 00:09:37,792
YOUR FEET ARE IN A TUB
FULL OF THESE LITTLE SUCKERFISH

179
00:09:37,834 --> 00:09:39,583
THAT LITERALLY EAT
YOUR CALLUSES AWAY.

180
00:09:39,625 --> 00:09:42,291
GOBBLE THEM RIGHT UP.
CRAZY, HUH?

181
00:09:42,333 --> 00:09:43,875
- THAT'S DISGUSTING.

182
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:46,667
- THEN THEY SCRAPE YOUR SKIN
WITH BLOCKS OF SEA SALT,

183
00:09:46,709 --> 00:09:48,917
LUBE YOU UP WITH
SEAWEED INFUSED ALOE,

184
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:50,625
WRAP YOU IN TEA LEAVES,
PUT YOU IN A HOT BOX

185
00:09:50,667 --> 00:09:53,291
FOR FOUR HOURS AND BAM,
YOU'RE DONE!

186
00:09:53,333 --> 00:09:54,875
[cheers and boos
from the crowd]

187
00:09:54,917 --> 00:09:57,125
MAKO, LOOK AT ALL MY FANS.

188
00:09:57,166 --> 00:09:59,500
THEY MUST BE IN TOWN
FOR MY CORONATION.

189
00:09:59,542 --> 00:10:04,000
- UH, I DON'T KNOW IF ALL
THOSE PEOPLE ARE YOUR FANS.

190
00:10:04,041 --> 00:10:07,583
men: BOO!

191
00:10:07,625 --> 00:10:09,166
- YEAH!

192
00:10:09,208 --> 00:10:14,750
ALL RIGHT, WU!
[whooping]

193
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:27,166
- WU, WE HAVE TO GET YOU
OUT OF HERE.

194
00:10:27,208 --> 00:10:29,875
- WHAT?

195
00:10:33,208 --> 00:10:36,709
- GO, GO.

196
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:38,375
- WHAT JUST HAPPENED OUT THERE?

197
00:10:38,417 --> 00:10:41,625
- I THINK THOSE WERE KUVIRA
SUPPORTERS IN THE CROWD.

198
00:10:41,667 --> 00:10:43,583
- OH, NO!
MAKO, I'VE BEEN HIT.

199
00:10:43,625 --> 00:10:45,250
IT'S A GUSHER.

200
00:10:45,291 --> 00:10:48,709
- THAT'S NOT BLOOD,
IT'S STRAWBERRY PIE.

201
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:50,291
- HMM.

202
00:10:50,333 --> 00:10:53,709
OH, YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT.
BUT THAT WAS CLOSE.

203
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:55,750
I DON'T KNOW WHAT WOULD'VE
HAPPENED IF YOU WEREN'T THERE.

204
00:10:55,792 --> 00:10:57,834
- YOU WOULD'VE BEEN HIT
BY A PIE.

205
00:10:57,875 --> 00:10:59,417
IT'S REALLY NOT
THAT BIG OF A DEAL.

206
00:10:59,458 --> 00:11:00,834
- OR I COULD'VE BEEN KILLED.

207
00:11:00,875 --> 00:11:03,458
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'D EVER
DO WITHOUT YOU.

208
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:06,542
WAIT A SECOND,
DID YOU SAY STRAWBERRY PIE?

209
00:11:06,583 --> 00:11:09,250
I'M ALLERGIC TO STRAWBERRIES.

210
00:11:09,291 --> 00:11:10,917
I DON'T THINK I CAN BREATHE.

211
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:13,208
GET ME TO THE HOSPITAL,
WU DOWN.

212
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:15,625
- YOU'RE ALLERGIC
TO BEE STINGS.

213
00:11:15,667 --> 00:11:17,000
- OH, RIGHT.

214
00:11:17,041 --> 00:11:18,542
I ALWAYS
GET THOSE TWO MIXED UP.

215
00:11:18,583 --> 00:11:20,709
[whistle blows]

216
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:22,500
- LOOK!
A TRAIN MADE IT THROUGH.

217
00:11:22,542 --> 00:11:24,875
- MAYBE THEY BROUGHT
FOOD AND SUPPLIES.

218
00:11:24,917 --> 00:11:26,834
[hydraulics hiss]

219
00:11:32,875 --> 00:11:35,208
- HEY, WHAT'S YOUR BOYFRIEND
DOING HERE?

220
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:37,667
- IF HE'S HERE, HE MUST BE
WITH KUVIRA AND MY BROTHER.

221
00:11:37,709 --> 00:11:39,500
THIS ISN'T GOING TO BE GOOD.

222
00:11:39,542 --> 00:11:42,291
- BOLIN!
- KAI!

223
00:11:42,333 --> 00:11:43,875
[laughs]

224
00:11:43,917 --> 00:11:46,709
WOW, YOU ARE A LOT HEAVIER
THAN YOU USED TO BE,

225
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:48,041
YOU'RE REALLY GROWING UP.

226
00:11:48,083 --> 00:11:49,250
- WHAT'S UP WITH YOUR NEW HAIR?

227
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:50,709
YOU LOOK LIKE A STIFF.

228
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:52,500
- HEY, KUVIRA SAYS IT MAKES ME
LOOK INTELLIGENT

229
00:11:52,542 --> 00:11:53,750
AND PROFESSIONAL.

230
00:11:53,792 --> 00:11:56,500
- DON'T BELIEVE EVERYTHING
SHE SAYS.

231
00:11:56,542 --> 00:11:59,709
- OPAL, I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU'RE HERE TOO.

232
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:01,250
I MISSED YOU SO MUCH.

233
00:12:01,291 --> 00:12:03,166
- I MISSED YOU, TOO.

234
00:12:03,208 --> 00:12:05,542
- LOOK WHO IT IS.

235
00:12:05,583 --> 00:12:07,709
IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN,
LITTLE SISTER.

236
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:09,291
- WHAT A WONDERFUL SURPRISE.

237
00:12:09,333 --> 00:12:11,333
A HAPPY REUNION
FOR MY FAVORITE COUPLE.

238
00:12:11,375 --> 00:12:12,959
- HOW'S MOM DOING?

239
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,083
- LIKE YOU CARE.
SHE STILL HASN'T FORGIVEN YOU.

240
00:12:16,125 --> 00:12:18,667
- YOU KNOW, FOR SOMEONE WHO
CLAIMS TO BE SO ENLIGHTENED,

241
00:12:18,709 --> 00:12:20,709
MOM CAN REALLY HOLD A GRUDGE.

242
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:22,458
- I GUESS WHEN HER SON
BETRAYS HER--

243
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:23,959
- PLEASE.

244
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,458
OPAL. WE'RE NOT HERE
TO BICKER WITH YOU

245
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:26,959
ABOUT SOMETHING THAT HAPPENED
THREE YEARS AGO.

246
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,750
WE'RE HERE TO HELP THIS TOWN,
JUST LIKE YOU.

247
00:12:29,792 --> 00:12:32,500
- I'VE HEARD HOW YOU HELP
TOWNS--BY CONQUERING THEM.

248
00:12:32,542 --> 00:12:35,083
- I KNOW THE RUMORS ABOUT ME
CAN BE PRETTY NASTY,

249
00:12:35,125 --> 00:12:38,709
BUT I AM GIVING EVERYONE
IN THIS NATION A BETTER FUTURE,

250
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:41,166
AND WITH BOLIN'S HELP
AND MY FIANCE'S IDEAS,

251
00:12:41,208 --> 00:12:43,000
WE'RE LAYING THE GROUNDWORK
FOR THE PEOPLE TO ACHIEVE

252
00:12:43,041 --> 00:12:44,417
THEIR OWN GREATNESS.

253
00:12:44,458 --> 00:12:48,000
- YOUR FIANCE?
- YOU HAVEN'T HEARD?

254
00:12:48,041 --> 00:12:50,041
YOUR BROTHER
AND I ARE GETTING MARRIED.

255
00:12:50,083 --> 00:12:52,750
- ISN'T THAT GREAT,
SWEETIE?

256
00:12:52,792 --> 00:12:54,375
- I KNOW THINGS GOT HEATED
WITH YOUR FAMILY

257
00:12:54,417 --> 00:12:56,333
WHEN BAATAR AND I LEFT ZAOFU,

258
00:12:56,375 --> 00:13:00,333
BUT DON'T YOU THINK IT'S TIME
TO FORGIVE AND FORGET?

259
00:13:00,375 --> 00:13:02,208
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

260
00:13:05,125 --> 00:13:07,333
- HELLO, GOVERNOR.
I WAS WONDERING IF YOU

261
00:13:07,375 --> 00:13:09,625
AND I COULD TALK PRIVATELY.

262
00:13:09,667 --> 00:13:14,875
SO, HAVE YOU HAD TIME
TO RETHINK MY GENEROUS OFFER?

263
00:13:14,917 --> 00:13:17,959
- GENEROUS?
YOU WANT TO TAKE EVERYTHING.

264
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,667
HOW IS THAT GENEROUS?

265
00:13:19,709 --> 00:13:22,500
- GOVERNOR, YOUR STATE
HAS BEEN OVERRUN BY BANDITS.

266
00:13:22,542 --> 00:13:25,000
THEY HAVE YOU OUTNUMBERED
AND OUT-SUPPLIED.

267
00:13:25,041 --> 00:13:28,792
THE QUESTION'S NOT<i> IF</i>
THEY'LL TAKE OVER, IT'S<i> WHEN.</i>

268
00:13:28,834 --> 00:13:31,083
UNLESS YOU SIGN OUR DEAL.

269
00:13:31,125 --> 00:13:33,625
AGREE TO OUR TERMS
AND YOU'LL HAVE THE FULL FORCE

270
00:13:33,667 --> 00:13:35,959
OF MY ARMY BACKING YOU.

271
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,917
YOU WILL REMAIN IN CHARGE,
JUST UNDER MY SUPERVISION.

272
00:13:39,959 --> 00:13:43,000
I WILL SAVE YOUR LIFE,
AND THE LIVES OF YOUR CITIZENS.

273
00:13:43,041 --> 00:13:46,959
I THINK
THAT'S PRETTY GENEROUS.

274
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,333
- I KNOW
HOW YOU MANIPULATE STATES

275
00:13:49,375 --> 00:13:51,792
AND FORCE THEM
TO JOIN UP UNDER YOU.

276
00:13:51,834 --> 00:13:54,875
I KNOW THE ONLY REASON
YOU WANT THIS REGION

277
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:57,291
IS BECAUSE IT'S RICH IN ORE.

278
00:13:57,333 --> 00:13:59,542
THEY MIGHT CALL YOU
"THE GREAT UNITER,"

279
00:13:59,583 --> 00:14:01,959
BUT YOU'RE DESTROYING
EVERYTHING.

280
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,458
I'LL NEVER TURN
THE GREAT STATE OF YI

281
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:08,959
OVER TO YOU.

282
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,291
- YOU HAVE A LOT OF PRIDE,

283
00:14:10,333 --> 00:14:11,959
BUT IT CANNOT PROTECT
YOUR PEOPLE.

284
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,834
YOUR PRIDE WILL NOT STOP
THE HORDES

285
00:14:13,875 --> 00:14:15,709
AS YOUR CITY CRUMBLES
TO THE GROUND,

286
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:18,125
AND YOUR PRIDE CERTAINLY
WILL NOT FEED YOUR HUNGRY

287
00:14:18,166 --> 00:14:21,250
WHEN ALL
THAT IS LEFT IS RUBBLE.

288
00:14:21,291 --> 00:14:23,458
- LEAVE!
GET OUT OF MY STATE.

289
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:25,583
- YOU WILL PERISH,

290
00:14:25,625 --> 00:14:28,125
UNLESS
YOU TAKE MY GENEROUS OFFER.

291
00:14:37,125 --> 00:14:39,000
- IT'S TIME TO GO,
WE'RE NOT WANTED HERE.

292
00:14:39,041 --> 00:14:40,625
- WHAT HAPPENED?

293
00:14:40,667 --> 00:14:43,166
- IT APPEARS WE CAN'T
MAKE A DEAL RIGHT NOW.

294
00:14:43,208 --> 00:14:46,000
- WAIT, AREN'T YOU GUYS
GONNA STICK AROUND AND HELP?

295
00:14:46,041 --> 00:14:48,709
- HERE'S THE CONTRACT,
WE'LL WAIT AT THE BORDER

296
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:50,166
FOR ONE DAY.

297
00:14:50,208 --> 00:14:52,000
YOU GET THE GOVERNOR TO SIGN IT,

298
00:14:52,041 --> 00:14:56,625
AND YOU'LL HAVE ALL THE HELP
YOU NEED.

299
00:14:56,667 --> 00:14:58,917
- I GUESS I GOTTA GO.

300
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:00,375
- DON'T, PLEASE!

301
00:15:00,417 --> 00:15:01,875
YOU CAN'T TURN YOUR BACK
ON THESE PEOPLE.

302
00:15:01,917 --> 00:15:03,291
- I'M NOT.

303
00:15:03,333 --> 00:15:04,959
I WANT TO HELP, BUT IF
THE GOVERNOR WANTS US GONE,

304
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,083
THERE'S--THERE'S NOTHING
I CAN DO.

305
00:15:07,125 --> 00:15:09,458
I'M SORRY--HEY!

306
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:11,583
OPAL, PLEASE.

307
00:15:11,625 --> 00:15:14,709
- LEAVE IF THAT'S WHAT
YOU'RE GOING TO DO.

308
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:16,667
- [sighs]

309
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:25,125
- YOU KNOW, WE MIGHT NOT
NEED THEIR HELP AFTER ALL.

310
00:15:25,166 --> 00:15:27,834
THE ROADS MAY BE IMPASSABLE,
BUT NOT THE SKIES.

311
00:15:27,875 --> 00:15:30,208
WE CAN USE LEFTY TO FLY
TO ALL THE NEARBY VILLAGES,

312
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:31,750
PICK UP SUPPLIES
AND FLY BACK.

313
00:15:31,792 --> 00:15:32,834
- YOU'RE RIGHT.

314
00:15:32,875 --> 00:15:36,041
WE CAN SAVE
THIS TOWN OURSELVES.

315
00:15:39,417 --> 00:15:43,000
- SORRY WE COULDN'T GIVE YOU
MORE, THAT'S ALL WE COULD SPARE.

316
00:15:43,041 --> 00:15:44,667
- EVERY LITTLE BIT HELPS.

317
00:15:44,709 --> 00:15:47,000
BECAUSE OF YOU AND
THE OTHER FARMERS AROUND HERE,

318
00:15:47,041 --> 00:15:48,917
WE HAVE MORE THAN ENOUGH FOOD
TO FEED THE TOWN

319
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:52,417
UNTIL WE CAN GET SOME
REINFORCEMENTS.

320
00:15:52,458 --> 00:15:54,917
- THANKS.

321
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:58,625
[Lefty bellows]

322
00:15:58,667 --> 00:16:01,458
- SO...YOU AND BOLIN
DOING OKAY?

323
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:03,208
- I DON'T KNOW.

324
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:06,000
IT'S REALLY TOUGH HAVING
A LONG-DISTANCE RELATIONSHIP,

325
00:16:06,041 --> 00:16:08,375
AND I CAN'T STAND
THAT HE'S WORKING WITH KUVIRA.

326
00:16:08,417 --> 00:16:10,208
- I CAN TELL.

327
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:12,166
BUT IT DOES SEEM LIKE HE FOUND
HIS CALLING, DOESN'T IT?

328
00:16:12,208 --> 00:16:13,792
HE LOVES HELPING PEOPLE.

329
00:16:13,834 --> 00:16:16,542
- MAYBE, IT'S JUST--
HE'S CHANGED A LOT

330
00:16:16,583 --> 00:16:17,625
SINCE HE'S BEEN AROUND HER.

331
00:16:17,667 --> 00:16:19,041
- HE'S GROWING UP.

332
00:16:19,083 --> 00:16:23,083
- I JUST HOPE
WE'RE NOT GROWING APART.

333
00:16:23,125 --> 00:16:25,291
SPEAKING OF
LONG-DISTANCE RELATIONSHIPS,

334
00:16:25,333 --> 00:16:26,667
HOW ARE YOU AND JINORA DOING?

335
00:16:26,709 --> 00:16:28,667
- ACTUALLY, WE'RE DOING FINE.

336
00:16:28,709 --> 00:16:33,583
[airplane engine roaring]
YOU HEAR THAT?

337
00:16:33,625 --> 00:16:36,166
IT'S MORE BANDITS.

338
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:43,250
WE'RE HOOKED.

339
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:57,792
- [grunts]

340
00:17:17,834 --> 00:17:19,000
- NO!

341
00:17:19,041 --> 00:17:22,417
AH!

342
00:17:25,875 --> 00:17:28,750
WHOA!

[grunts]

345
00:17:57,041 --> 00:17:59,208
- WHAT HAPPENED?
WHERE'S ALL THE FOOD?

346
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:02,208
- WE WERE ATTACKED IN MID-AIR.
WE LOST EVERYTHING.

347
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:05,125
- IT MIGHT BE TIME
TO MAKE A TOUGH CALL.

348
00:18:18,875 --> 00:18:22,041
- HERE, TELL KUVIRA
TO SAVE MY PEOPLE.

349
00:18:22,083 --> 00:18:25,375
- FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH, I THINK
YOU MADE THE RIGHT DECISION.

350
00:18:25,417 --> 00:18:28,709
- DID I EVER REALLY HAVE
A CHOICE?

351
00:18:34,208 --> 00:18:36,583
- WHEN KORRA GETS HERE,
I BET SHE'S NOT EVEN

352
00:18:36,625 --> 00:18:39,542
GONNA KNOW WHO I AM.
- WHY IS THAT?

353
00:18:39,583 --> 00:18:41,875
- BECAUSE MEELO THE BOY

354
00:18:41,917 --> 00:18:46,375
HAS TURNED INTO
MEELO THE MAN.

355
00:18:46,417 --> 00:18:50,041
- RIGHT, YOU'RE
COMPLETELY UNRECOGNIZABLE.

356
00:18:50,083 --> 00:18:52,709
- [chuckles] YOU'VE NEVER
HAD THE TEA LEAF WRAP?

357
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:54,917
YOU HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT YOU'RE MISSING.

358
00:18:54,959 --> 00:18:57,250
THE FACE MASSAGE ALONE
IS TO DIE FOR.

359
00:18:57,291 --> 00:19:00,041
- UGH. THIS CORONATION
CANNOT SOME SOON ENOUGH.

360
00:19:00,083 --> 00:19:02,834
I CAN'T WAIT TO GO BACK
TO BEING A DETECTIVE.

361
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:06,500
- RIGHT.
UM, YEAH, ABOUT THAT.

362
00:19:06,542 --> 00:19:08,250
- WHAT?

363
00:19:08,291 --> 00:19:10,417
- I DON'T KNOW
HOW TO TELL YOU THIS.

364
00:19:10,458 --> 00:19:12,625
YOU'RE GOING TO BA SING SE
WITH THE PRINCE.

365
00:19:12,667 --> 00:19:14,417
- NO!

366
00:19:14,458 --> 00:19:16,709
- I TRIED TO GET YOU OUT OF IT,
BUT IT'S OVER MY HEAD.

367
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:19,083
- [groans]
- WU PERSONALLY ASKED RAIKO.

368
00:19:19,125 --> 00:19:21,000
HE SAID HE DOESN'T KNOW
WHAT HE'D DO WITHOUT YOU.

369
00:19:21,041 --> 00:19:22,208
- THIS CAN'T BE HAPPENING.

370
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:24,041
I'M NOT EVEN AN EARTH KINGDOM
CITIZEN.

371
00:19:24,083 --> 00:19:26,250
I WORK FOR THE REPUBLIC CITY
POLICE DEPARTMENT.

372
00:19:26,291 --> 00:19:28,000
- NOT ANYMORE.

373
00:19:28,041 --> 00:19:29,542
YOU'RE JUST A PAWN
IN RAIKO'S DIPLOMATIC GAME.

374
00:19:29,583 --> 00:19:31,208
YOU CAN TRY TALKING TO HIM,
BUT I DON'T THINK

375
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:34,417
HE'S GOING TO LET YOU QUIT.
- [sighs]

376
00:19:34,458 --> 00:19:37,125
- THERE'S A SOUTHERN WATER TRIBE
SHIP PULLING UP TO THE DOCK.

377
00:19:37,166 --> 00:19:39,458

378

- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
ISN'T KORRA ALREADY HERE?

387
00:21:02,875 --> 00:21:05,500
- NO, WE THOUGHT
SHE WAS COMING WITH YOU.

388
00:21:05,542 --> 00:21:08,000
- KORRA LEFT THE SOUTH POLE
SIX MONTHS AGO.

389
00:21:08,041 --> 00:21:09,750
SHE'S WRITTEN ME LETTERS.

390
00:21:09,792 --> 00:21:11,792
SHE SAID SHE WAS HERE
IN REPUBLIC CITY.

391
00:21:11,834 --> 00:21:15,000
- I ASSURE YOU,
YOUR DAUGHTER'S NOT HERE.

392
00:21:15,041 --> 00:21:17,458
- THEN WHERE IS SHE?

393
