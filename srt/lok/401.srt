1
00:00:05,906 --> 00:00:07,173
Earth.

2
00:00:07,808 --> 00:00:09,260
Fire.

3
00:00:09,892 --> 00:00:11,085
Air.

4
00:00:11,409 --> 00:00:12,639
Water.

5
00:00:13,846 --> 00:00:17,614
Only the Avatar can
master all four elements,

6
00:00:17,615 --> 00:00:20,053
and bring balance to the world.

7
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:33,891
Welcome to Republic City,
the place of hopes, dreams,

8
00:00:33,892 --> 00:00:35,316
and spirit wilds.

9
00:00:35,317 --> 00:00:38,409
This Metropolis truly has
something for everyone.

10
00:00:38,410 --> 00:00:42,194
Visit Air Temple Island,
the hub for all air benders

11
00:00:42,195 --> 00:00:44,328
as they travel the world helping others.

12
00:00:44,329 --> 00:00:47,971
Or take a stroll through
beautiful Avatar Korra Park,

13
00:00:47,972 --> 00:00:50,457
named in honor of you-know-who.

14
00:00:50,458 --> 00:00:53,370
We've missed her these past
three years and we can't wait

15
00:00:53,371 --> 00:00:54,658
to welcome her home.

16
00:00:54,659 --> 00:00:56,519
Get well soon, Korra.

17
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:59,583
And of course you'll want to
see our most unique attractions,

18
00:00:59,584 --> 00:01:01,320
the spirit wilds.

19
00:01:01,321 --> 00:01:04,748
Here spirits and people
live harmoniously together,

20
00:01:04,749 --> 00:01:08,207
like this old codger and his new pals.

21
00:01:08,672 --> 00:01:12,217
Yes sirree, this town is
truly on the up and up.

22
00:01:12,218 --> 00:01:15,565
Come be a part of the
action in Republic City.

23
00:01:17,142 --> 00:01:21,212
And of course, my biggest
thanks goes to Asami Sato

24
00:01:21,213 --> 00:01:22,246
and future industries.

25
00:01:22,247 --> 00:01:25,916
She brought our old central
terminal into the modern era.

26
00:01:25,917 --> 00:01:29,820
Ladies and gentlemen, the
world is entering a new age

27
00:01:29,821 --> 00:01:31,255
of peace and prosperity.

28
00:01:31,256 --> 00:01:34,659
Soon, Prince Wu will
take his rightful place

29
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:36,260
on the Earth Kingdom throne,

30
00:01:36,261 --> 00:01:38,763
and thanks to our updated rail system,

31
00:01:38,764 --> 00:01:40,798
Republic City and the Earth Kingdom

32
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:42,500
will be united like never before.

33
00:01:48,307 --> 00:01:50,508
Hey there, Asami right?

34
00:01:50,509 --> 00:01:51,742
Great train house.

35
00:01:51,743 --> 00:01:54,145
Maybe you can give me a
personal tour sometime,

36
00:01:54,146 --> 00:01:55,012
what do you say?

37
00:01:55,013 --> 00:01:57,882
I do like the idea of
putting you on a train

38
00:01:57,883 --> 00:02:00,351
and sending you far, far away.

39
00:02:00,352 --> 00:02:03,120
That's... that's funny.

40
00:02:03,121 --> 00:02:04,655
I like funny dames.

41
00:02:04,656 --> 00:02:06,290
Maybe I should introduce myself,

42
00:02:06,291 --> 00:02:08,025
I'm Prince Wu, future king.

43
00:02:08,026 --> 00:02:11,028
Yeah... I'm aware of who you are.

44
00:02:11,029 --> 00:02:13,030
Don't let my reputation intimidate you.

45
00:02:13,031 --> 00:02:15,800
I'm still human just like everyone else,

46
00:02:15,801 --> 00:02:19,570
only more human, like extra-human,

47
00:02:19,571 --> 00:02:20,905
or, hmm, super-human.

48
00:02:20,906 --> 00:02:22,707
Super-human?

49
00:02:22,708 --> 00:02:23,874
So, what do you say?

50
00:02:23,875 --> 00:02:25,176
Can I show you a low-key night out

51
00:02:25,177 --> 00:02:29,246
with a super-human soon to be king?

52
00:02:29,247 --> 00:02:32,650
Prince Wu, President Reiko
has some really important

53
00:02:32,651 --> 00:02:34,618
king stuff to talk to you about.

54
00:02:34,619 --> 00:02:37,755
Now? Fine.

55
00:02:37,756 --> 00:02:41,158
Think over the offer, I'll be back.

56
00:02:42,627 --> 00:02:44,328
He's a real charmer, huh?

57
00:02:44,329 --> 00:02:46,664
He's... something.

58
00:02:46,665 --> 00:02:48,366
How can you stand being his bodyguard?

59
00:02:48,367 --> 00:02:52,269
Well, I just remind myself
that once he's on the throne,

60
00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:54,004
I go back to being a detective.

61
00:02:54,005 --> 00:02:55,673
- And that works?
- I also go home

62
00:02:55,674 --> 00:02:57,608
and smash my head into
the wall for an hour.

63
00:02:57,609 --> 00:02:59,276
You know, just to get the stress out.

64
00:03:00,212 --> 00:03:03,280
It's good to see you,
Mako. It's been too long.

65
00:03:03,281 --> 00:03:04,715
You hear from Bolin lately?

66
00:03:04,716 --> 00:03:06,016
I haven't talked to him for a while,

67
00:03:06,017 --> 00:03:07,651
but he's coming in a few
days for the coronation.

68
00:03:07,652 --> 00:03:10,688
And Bei Fong told me that
Korra is getting in tonight.

69
00:03:10,689 --> 00:03:12,256
I can't wait to see her.

70
00:03:12,257 --> 00:03:14,892
It's gonna be weird
having the old team avatar

71
00:03:14,893 --> 00:03:17,528
back in the city after all these years.

72
00:03:17,529 --> 00:03:20,131
After your coronation the united forces

73
00:03:20,132 --> 00:03:21,999
will escort you to Ba Sing Se.

74
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:22,933
Right, about that.

75
00:03:22,934 --> 00:03:25,169
Are we all positive that the Earth Kingdom

76
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:26,704
is safe enough for me to return?

77
00:03:26,705 --> 00:03:28,639
I don't have to remind
everyone what happened

78
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,808
to my great aunt three years ago?

79
00:03:33,812 --> 00:03:34,845
May she rest in peace.

80
00:03:34,846 --> 00:03:38,215
Prince Wu, I assure you
Kuvira has the Earth Kingdom

81
00:03:38,216 --> 00:03:41,085
pretty much stabilized at this point.

82
00:03:41,086 --> 00:03:42,586
Define: "pretty much."

83
00:03:42,587 --> 00:03:46,757
Well, the roving bandits
have mostly been dispersed.

84
00:03:46,758 --> 00:03:47,625
Mostly?

85
00:03:47,626 --> 00:03:48,292
Don't worry kid.

86
00:03:48,293 --> 00:03:51,862
The chances of you being
assassinated are almost zero.

87
00:03:51,863 --> 00:03:53,531
Almost?

88
00:04:04,042 --> 00:04:05,242
Get out of here.

89
00:04:05,243 --> 00:04:08,579
We don't have anything left.

90
00:04:17,689 --> 00:04:21,058
Now, you don't have anything left.

91
00:04:53,825 --> 00:04:55,826
It's safe to come out everyone,

92
00:04:55,827 --> 00:04:57,094
the airbenders are here.

93
00:04:57,095 --> 00:04:59,530
You finally made it.

94
00:04:59,531 --> 00:05:01,699
So, where are the rest of you?

95
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:03,667
Actually, it's just the two of us,

96
00:05:03,668 --> 00:05:06,837
but we're going to do
everything we can to help.

97
00:05:06,838 --> 00:05:08,639
I'm Opal, and this is Kai

98
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:10,040
- it's nice to meet you.
- What?

99
00:05:10,041 --> 00:05:12,510
I called Master Tenzin
because my state has been

100
00:05:12,511 --> 00:05:14,245
under siege by bandits for months.

101
00:05:14,246 --> 00:05:18,582
They blocked all the roads,
cut off our supply lines,

102
00:05:18,583 --> 00:05:21,485
and all he sent is you two kids?

103
00:05:21,486 --> 00:05:22,319
Hey, us two kids

104
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,954
just took care of those three guys for you.

105
00:05:23,955 --> 00:05:26,657
There are hundreds more
where they came from.

106
00:05:26,658 --> 00:05:27,858
My citizens are going hungry.

107
00:05:27,859 --> 00:05:31,061
Our entire state is on
the brink of collapse.

108
00:05:31,062 --> 00:05:33,130
Unfortunately, the air nation is

109
00:05:33,131 --> 00:05:34,765
spread thin right now.

110
00:05:34,766 --> 00:05:37,468
We're all you have.

111
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:47,811
We just got some good news.

112
00:05:47,812 --> 00:05:50,915
Two more Earth Kingdom
states have agreed to join us.

113
00:05:50,916 --> 00:05:53,984
Excellent. Thank you, Bolin.

114
00:05:53,985 --> 00:05:56,687
We're 90% there, Kuvira.

115
00:05:56,688 --> 00:05:57,922
That's great!

116
00:05:57,923 --> 00:06:02,693
Julie, dish out some of
that special celebration tea.

117
00:06:07,766 --> 00:06:08,933
None for me.

118
00:06:08,934 --> 00:06:11,669
I won't celebrate until the Earth Kingdom

119
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:14,438
is 100% reunited.

120
00:06:24,783 --> 00:06:26,183
Why have we stopped?

121
00:06:26,184 --> 00:06:29,119
Apologies, there are rocks on the tracks.

122
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,187
It's most likely bandits.

123
00:06:30,188 --> 00:06:32,790
We're sending troops
to handle the situation.

124
00:06:32,791 --> 00:06:33,657
Call them off.

125
00:06:33,658 --> 00:06:37,027
I will take care of the bandits myself.

126
00:07:11,197 --> 00:07:13,932
- Gah!
- O-wah!

127
00:07:16,702 --> 00:07:19,437
- Aah!
- Oww!

128
00:07:19,438 --> 00:07:22,774
- Ahh!
- Argh!

129
00:07:22,775 --> 00:07:24,876
Ugh, ooh!

130
00:07:31,717 --> 00:07:34,386
- Ehh!
- Ack, ohh!

131
00:08:01,947 --> 00:08:03,648
You're... Kuvira.

132
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:05,950
And you're the bandits
who have been causing chaos

133
00:08:05,951 --> 00:08:09,621
where I am trying to
establish order, aren't you?

134
00:08:09,622 --> 00:08:10,622
We're sorry.

135
00:08:10,623 --> 00:08:12,223
We didn't know this was your train...

136
00:08:12,224 --> 00:08:15,193
Don't talk over me.

137
00:08:15,194 --> 00:08:17,962
Please, take mercy on us.

138
00:08:17,963 --> 00:08:21,766
Stop groveling as if this is
the worst day of your life.

139
00:08:21,767 --> 00:08:23,134
This is a good day.

140
00:08:23,135 --> 00:08:25,470
I'm gonna give you all the opportunity

141
00:08:25,471 --> 00:08:26,805
to rehabilitate yourselves

142
00:08:26,806 --> 00:08:30,442
and become productive
members of your nation.

143
00:08:30,443 --> 00:08:32,544
Right now, you're lost,

144
00:08:32,545 --> 00:08:33,845
but pledge your loyalty to me,

145
00:08:33,846 --> 00:08:36,281
and I'll give you a new
purpose in your lives.

146
00:08:36,282 --> 00:08:37,982
Of course, if you don't want to join,

147
00:08:37,983 --> 00:08:39,951
you could always stay right here.

148
00:08:39,952 --> 00:08:41,086
Hopefully someone saves you

149
00:08:41,087 --> 00:08:43,088
before the next train speeds through,

150
00:08:43,089 --> 00:08:45,256
but I wouldn't count on it.

151
00:08:45,257 --> 00:08:46,191
No, we'll join.

152
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:47,058
Don't leave us here.

153
00:08:47,059 --> 00:08:52,030
We pledge our loyalty to you, great uniter.

154
00:08:59,004 --> 00:09:04,242
♪

155
00:09:04,243 --> 00:09:06,258
I don't know why we're leaving so early

156
00:09:06,259 --> 00:09:07,178
if you're just getting a haircut.

157
00:09:07,179 --> 00:09:10,048
The dinner at air temple island
isn't until later tonight.

158
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:11,983
Because I'm not just getting a haircut.

159
00:09:11,984 --> 00:09:12,984
It's a spa day.

160
00:09:12,985 --> 00:09:15,587
We're talking minimum four hours.

161
00:09:15,588 --> 00:09:16,588
Are you kidding me?

162
00:09:16,589 --> 00:09:19,290
What are you having done
that takes four hours?

163
00:09:19,291 --> 00:09:21,860
A rejuvenating tea leaf skin wrap.

164
00:09:21,861 --> 00:09:23,695
Have you ever gotten one of those, Mako?

165
00:09:23,696 --> 00:09:26,765
Yeah, I'm not interested.

166
00:09:26,766 --> 00:09:29,634
Oh, you will be.

167
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:33,538
So while your hands soak
in a bubbling milk bath,

168
00:09:33,539 --> 00:09:36,241
your feet are in a tub full
of these little suckerfish

169
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:38,343
that literally eat your calluses away.

170
00:09:38,344 --> 00:09:41,212
Gobble them right up. Crazy, huh?

171
00:09:41,213 --> 00:09:42,313
That's disgusting.

172
00:09:42,314 --> 00:09:45,183
Then they scrape your skin
with blocks of sea salt,

173
00:09:45,184 --> 00:09:47,252
lube you up with seaweed infused aloe,

174
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:49,354
wrap you in tea leaves,
put you in a hot box

175
00:09:49,355 --> 00:09:51,990
for four hours and bam, you're done!

176
00:09:53,793 --> 00:09:55,727
Mako, look at all my fans.

177
00:09:55,728 --> 00:09:57,796
They must be in town for my coronation.

178
00:09:57,797 --> 00:10:03,201
Uh, I don't know if all
those people are your fans.

179
00:10:03,202 --> 00:10:06,838
Boo!

180
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:07,972
Yeah!

181
00:10:07,973 --> 00:10:14,479
All right, Wu!

182
00:10:23,823 --> 00:10:26,524
Wu, we have to get you out of here.

183
00:10:26,525 --> 00:10:29,594
What?

184
00:10:32,331 --> 00:10:35,567
Go, go.

185
00:10:35,568 --> 00:10:36,734
What just happened out there?

186
00:10:36,735 --> 00:10:40,305
I think those were Kuvira
supporters in the crowd.

187
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:42,774
Oh, no! Mako, I've been hit.

188
00:10:42,775 --> 00:10:43,808
It's a gusher.

189
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:47,979
That's not blood, it's strawberry pie.

190
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:48,746
Hmm.

191
00:10:48,747 --> 00:10:51,883
Oh, yeah, you're right. But that was close.

192
00:10:51,884 --> 00:10:54,319
I don't know what would've
happened if you weren't there.

193
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,321
You would've been hit by a pie.

194
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:58,189
It's really not that big of a deal.

195
00:10:58,190 --> 00:10:59,357
Or I could've been killed.

196
00:10:59,358 --> 00:11:01,860
I don't know what I'd ever do without you.

197
00:11:01,861 --> 00:11:05,196
Wait a second, did you say strawberry pie?

198
00:11:05,197 --> 00:11:07,999
I'm allergic to strawberries.

199
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,634
I don't think I can breathe.

200
00:11:09,635 --> 00:11:11,870
Get me to the hospital, Wu down.

201
00:11:11,871 --> 00:11:14,772
You're allergic to bee stings.

202
00:11:14,773 --> 00:11:15,707
Oh, right.

203
00:11:15,708 --> 00:11:17,642
I always get those two mixed up.

204
00:11:19,278 --> 00:11:20,979
Look! A train made it through.

205
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:23,915
Maybe they brought food and supplies.

206
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:33,258
Hey, what's your boyfriend doing here?

207
00:11:33,259 --> 00:11:36,327
If he's here, he must be
with Kuvira and my brother.

208
00:11:36,328 --> 00:11:38,596
This isn't going to be good.

209
00:11:38,597 --> 00:11:41,599
- Bolin!
- Kai!

210
00:11:42,134 --> 00:11:45,637
Wow, you are a lot heavier
than you used to be,

211
00:11:45,638 --> 00:11:46,771
you're really growing up.

212
00:11:46,772 --> 00:11:48,106
What's up with your new hair?

213
00:11:48,107 --> 00:11:49,040
You look like a stiff.

214
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:51,609
Hey, Kuvira says it
makes me look intelligent

215
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:52,443
and professional.

216
00:11:52,444 --> 00:11:54,979
Don't believe everything she says.

217
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:58,616
Opal, I can't believe you're here too.

218
00:11:58,617 --> 00:12:00,084
I missed you so much.

219
00:12:00,085 --> 00:12:02,086
I missed you, too.

220
00:12:02,087 --> 00:12:03,888
Look who it is.

221
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:06,524
It's good to see you again, little sister.

222
00:12:06,525 --> 00:12:07,725
What a wonderful surprise.

223
00:12:07,726 --> 00:12:10,361
A happy reunion for my favorite couple.

224
00:12:10,862 --> 00:12:11,862
How's mom doing?

225
00:12:12,363 --> 00:12:15,065
Like you care. She still
hasn't forgiven you.

226
00:12:15,066 --> 00:12:18,235
You know, for someone who
claims to be so enlightened,

227
00:12:18,236 --> 00:12:20,103
mom can really hold a grudge.

228
00:12:20,104 --> 00:12:22,639
I guess when her son betrays her.

229
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:23,273
Please.

230
00:12:23,274 --> 00:12:24,775
Opal. We're not here to bicker with you

231
00:12:24,776 --> 00:12:26,376
about something that
happened three years ago.

232
00:12:26,377 --> 00:12:28,912
We're here to help this
town, just like you.

233
00:12:28,913 --> 00:12:31,748
I've heard how you help
towns by conquering them.

234
00:12:31,749 --> 00:12:34,117
I know the rumors about
me can be pretty nasty,

235
00:12:34,118 --> 00:12:37,988
but I am giving everyone in
this nation a better future,

236
00:12:37,989 --> 00:12:40,223
and with Bolin's help
and my fiancé's ideas,

237
00:12:40,224 --> 00:12:42,893
we're laying the groundwork
for the people to achieve

238
00:12:42,894 --> 00:12:43,927
their own greatness.

239
00:12:43,928 --> 00:12:47,331
- Your fiancé?
- You haven't heard?

240
00:12:47,332 --> 00:12:49,766
Your brother and I are getting married.

241
00:12:49,767 --> 00:12:52,069
Isn't that great, sweetie?

242
00:12:52,070 --> 00:12:54,004
I know things got heated with your family

243
00:12:54,005 --> 00:12:55,339
when Baatar and I left Zaofu,

244
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:59,977
but don't you think it's
time to forgive and forget?

245
00:12:59,978 --> 00:13:02,679
What are you doing here?

246
00:13:04,282 --> 00:13:06,950
Hello, Governor. I was wondering if you

247
00:13:06,951 --> 00:13:08,719
and I could talk privately.

248
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:14,124
So, have you had time to
rethink my generous offer?

249
00:13:14,125 --> 00:13:17,761
Generous? You want to take everything.

250
00:13:17,762 --> 00:13:18,795
How is that generous?

251
00:13:18,796 --> 00:13:21,832
Governor, your state has
been overrun by bandits.

252
00:13:21,833 --> 00:13:24,001
They have you outnumbered
and out-supplied.

253
00:13:24,002 --> 00:13:28,605
The question's not if
they'll take over, it's when.

254
00:13:28,606 --> 00:13:30,173
Unless you sign our deal.

255
00:13:30,174 --> 00:13:33,477
Agree to our terms and
you'll have the full force

256
00:13:33,478 --> 00:13:34,978
of my army backing you.

257
00:13:34,979 --> 00:13:38,915
You will remain in charge,
just under my supervision.

258
00:13:38,916 --> 00:13:42,552
I will save your life, and
the lives of your citizens.

259
00:13:42,553 --> 00:13:46,556
I think that's pretty generous.

260
00:13:46,557 --> 00:13:48,759
I know how you manipulate states

261
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:51,028
and force them to join up under you.

262
00:13:51,029 --> 00:13:54,598
I know the only reason you want this region

263
00:13:54,599 --> 00:13:56,666
is because it's rich in ore.

264
00:13:56,667 --> 00:13:58,969
They might call you "The Great Uniter,"

265
00:13:58,970 --> 00:14:01,171
but you're destroying everything.

266
00:14:01,172 --> 00:14:05,275
I'll never turn the great state of Yi

267
00:14:05,276 --> 00:14:08,645
over to you.

268
00:14:08,646 --> 00:14:09,713
You have a lot of pride,

269
00:14:09,714 --> 00:14:11,281
but it cannot protect your people.

270
00:14:11,282 --> 00:14:13,116
Your pride will not stop the hordes

271
00:14:13,117 --> 00:14:14,818
as your city crumbles to the ground,

272
00:14:14,819 --> 00:14:17,621
and your pride certainly
will not feed your hungry

273
00:14:17,622 --> 00:14:20,791
when all that is left is rubble.

274
00:14:20,792 --> 00:14:23,160
Leave! Get out of my state.

275
00:14:23,161 --> 00:14:24,928
You will perish,

276
00:14:24,929 --> 00:14:28,565
unless you take my generous offer.

277
00:14:36,474 --> 00:14:38,909
It's time to go, we're not wanted here.

278
00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:39,843
What happened?

279
00:14:39,844 --> 00:14:42,145
It appears we can't make a deal right now.

280
00:14:42,146 --> 00:14:45,148
Wait, aren't you guys
gonna stick around and help?

281
00:14:45,149 --> 00:14:49,786
Here's the contract, we'll
wait at the border for one day.

282
00:14:49,787 --> 00:14:51,288
You get the governor to sign it,

283
00:14:51,289 --> 00:14:56,293
and you'll have all the help you need.

284
00:14:56,294 --> 00:14:58,829
I guess I gotta go.

285
00:14:58,830 --> 00:14:59,696
Don't, please!

286
00:14:59,697 --> 00:15:01,798
You can't turn your back on these people.

287
00:15:01,799 --> 00:15:02,399
I'm not.

288
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:04,468
I want to help, but if
the governor wants us gone,

289
00:15:04,469 --> 00:15:06,870
there's-there's nothing I can do.

290
00:15:06,871 --> 00:15:09,206
I'm sorry... hey!

291
00:15:09,207 --> 00:15:10,774
Opal, please.

292
00:15:10,775 --> 00:15:14,711
Leave if that's what you're going to do.

293
00:15:21,786 --> 00:15:24,154
You know, we might not
need their help after all.

294
00:15:24,155 --> 00:15:26,823
The roads may be impassable,
but not the skies.

295
00:15:26,824 --> 00:15:29,726
We can use lefty to fly
to all the nearby villages,

296
00:15:29,727 --> 00:15:31,628
pick up supplies and fly back.

297
00:15:31,629 --> 00:15:32,362
You're right.

298
00:15:32,363 --> 00:15:36,500
We can save this town ourselves.

299
00:15:38,136 --> 00:15:42,672
Sorry we couldn't give you
more, that's all we could spare.

300
00:15:42,673 --> 00:15:43,740
Every little bit helps.

301
00:15:43,741 --> 00:15:46,076
Because of you and the
other farmers around here,

302
00:15:46,077 --> 00:15:48,111
we have more than enough
food to feed the town

303
00:15:48,112 --> 00:15:52,282
until we can get some reinforcements.

304
00:15:52,283 --> 00:15:54,751
Thanks.

305
00:15:57,989 --> 00:16:01,124
So... you and Bolin doing okay?

306
00:16:01,125 --> 00:16:02,058
I don't know.

307
00:16:02,059 --> 00:16:04,995
It's really tough having a
long-distance relationship,

308
00:16:04,996 --> 00:16:08,098
and I can't stand that
he's working with Kuvira.

309
00:16:08,099 --> 00:16:09,065
I can tell.

310
00:16:09,066 --> 00:16:11,801
But it does seem like he
found his calling, doesn't it?

311
00:16:11,802 --> 00:16:12,969
He loves helping people.

312
00:16:12,970 --> 00:16:16,006
Maybe, it's just he's changed a lot

313
00:16:16,007 --> 00:16:17,240
since he's been around her.

314
00:16:17,241 --> 00:16:18,208
He's growing up.

315
00:16:18,209 --> 00:16:22,145
I just hope we're not growing apart.

316
00:16:22,146 --> 00:16:24,748
Speaking of long-distance relationships,

317
00:16:24,749 --> 00:16:26,049
how are you and Jinora doing?

318
00:16:26,050 --> 00:16:27,851
Actually, we're doing fine.

319
00:16:27,852 --> 00:16:33,390
You hear that?

320
00:16:33,391 --> 00:16:36,526
It's more bandits.

321
00:16:40,264 --> 00:16:43,600
We're hooked.

322
00:17:17,702 --> 00:17:18,902
No!

323
00:17:18,903 --> 00:17:22,672
Ah!

324
00:17:25,743 --> 00:17:28,945
Whoa!

325
00:17:54,939 --> 00:17:58,041
What happened? Where's all the food?

326
00:17:58,042 --> 00:18:01,344
We were attacked in mid
air. We lost everything.

327
00:18:01,345 --> 00:18:05,181
It might be time to make a tough call.

328
00:18:17,895 --> 00:18:20,730
Here, tell Kuvira to save my people.

329
00:18:20,731 --> 00:18:24,634
For what it's worth, I think
you made the right decision.

330
00:18:24,635 --> 00:18:28,838
Did I ever really have a choice?

331
00:18:33,044 --> 00:18:35,745
When Korra gets here, I bet she's not even

332
00:18:35,746 --> 00:18:38,948
gonna know who I am. Why is that?

333
00:18:38,949 --> 00:18:41,051
Because Meelo the boy

334
00:18:41,052 --> 00:18:45,255
has turned into Meelo the man.

335
00:18:45,256 --> 00:18:48,925
Right, you're completely unrecognizable.

336
00:18:48,926 --> 00:18:51,861
You've never
had the tea leaf wrap?

337
00:18:51,862 --> 00:18:53,997
You have no idea what you're missing.

338
00:18:53,998 --> 00:18:56,132
The face massage alone is to die for.

339
00:18:56,133 --> 00:18:58,935
Ugh. This coronation
cannot some soon enough.

340
00:18:58,936 --> 00:19:02,005
I can't wait to go back
to being a detective.

341
00:19:02,006 --> 00:19:06,109
Right. Um, yeah, about that.

342
00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:07,177
What?

343
00:19:07,178 --> 00:19:09,245
I don't know how to tell you this.

344
00:19:09,246 --> 00:19:12,248
You're going to Ba Sing Se with the prince.

345
00:19:12,249 --> 00:19:13,016
No!

346
00:19:13,017 --> 00:19:15,719
I tried to get you out of
it, but it's over my head.

347
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:17,854
Wu personally asked Raiko.

348
00:19:17,855 --> 00:19:20,223
He said he doesn't know
what he'd do without you.

349
00:19:20,224 --> 00:19:21,358
This can't be happening.

350
00:19:21,359 --> 00:19:22,859
I'm not even an Earth Kingdom citizen.

351
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:25,829
I work for the Republic
city police department.

352
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:26,830
Not anymore.

353
00:19:26,831 --> 00:19:28,498
You're just a pawn in
Raiko's diplomatic game.

354
00:19:28,499 --> 00:19:30,367
You can try talking to
him, but I don't think

355
00:19:30,368 --> 00:19:32,969
he's going to let you quit.

356
00:19:32,970 --> 00:19:36,873
There's a Southern water tribe
ship pulling up to the dock.

357
00:19:36,874 --> 00:19:39,609
Korra!

358
00:19:57,862 --> 00:20:00,432
- Cool!
- Yeah!

359
00:20:07,772 --> 00:20:12,876
The state of Yi is now under
the full protection of my army.

360
00:20:15,312 --> 00:20:21,384
Proclaim your loyalty, if
you wish to keep your post.

361
00:20:21,385 --> 00:20:28,057
I pledge my loyalty to you, great uniter.

362
00:20:52,483 --> 00:20:55,585
Tonraq, it's good to
have you back in the city,

363
00:20:55,586 --> 00:20:58,121
and everyone is excited
to see the avatar again.

364
00:20:58,122 --> 00:21:01,825
What do you mean? Isn't Korra already here?

365
00:21:01,826 --> 00:21:04,227
No, we thought she was coming with you.

366
00:21:04,228 --> 00:21:07,430
Korra left the south pole six months ago.

367
00:21:07,431 --> 00:21:08,698
She's written me letters.

368
00:21:08,699 --> 00:21:10,700
She said she was here in Republic City.

369
00:21:10,701 --> 00:21:14,270
I assure you, your daughter's not here.

370
00:21:14,271 --> 00:21:16,940
Then where is she?

371
00:21:28,085 --> 00:21:31,588
Is that all you got?

372
00:21:41,632 --> 00:21:46,636
Unh!

373
00:21:46,637 --> 00:21:48,304
Unh.

374
00:21:48,305 --> 00:21:53,076
We have a winner.

375
00:21:54,211 --> 00:21:59,015
Here, for your lackluster participation.

376
00:21:59,016 --> 00:21:59,682
Thanks.

377
00:21:59,683 --> 00:22:02,085
You know, you look very familiar.

378
00:22:02,086 --> 00:22:06,256
Yeah, you kind of look
like that avatar girl.

379
00:22:06,257 --> 00:22:07,657
I get that a lot.

380
00:22:07,658 --> 00:22:10,527
Whatever happened to her anyway?

381
00:22:10,528 --> 00:22:11,770
I wouldn't know.
