1
00:00:07,547 --> 00:00:09,548
Earth.

2
00:00:09,549 --> 00:00:11,049
Fire.

3
00:00:11,050 --> 00:00:13,051
Air.

4
00:00:13,052 --> 00:00:15,153
Water.

5
00:00:15,154 --> 00:00:18,957
Only the Avatar can master
all four elements

6
00:00:18,958 --> 00:00:21,259
and bring balance to the world.

7
00:00:27,233 --> 00:00:28,600
- After 10,000 years,

8
00:00:28,601 --> 00:00:30,402
harmonic convergence is here again,

9
00:00:30,403 --> 00:00:32,637
and the dark spirit Vaatu is free.

10
00:00:32,638 --> 00:00:34,840
Tenzin, Bumi, and Kya
have entered the portal

11
00:00:34,841 --> 00:00:36,608
to rescue Jinora's spirit.

12
00:00:36,609 --> 00:00:38,143
Asami split from the group

13
00:00:38,144 --> 00:00:40,612
and took the injured Tonraq to safety.

14
00:00:40,613 --> 00:00:43,782
So it's up to Korra, Mako,
and Bolin to stop Unalaq

15
00:00:43,783 --> 00:00:48,783
before he fuses with Vaatu
and becomes a Dark Avatar!

16
00:00:57,997 --> 00:01:02,997
- Raava,
nothing could stop this moment.

17
00:01:03,002 --> 00:01:07,339
Harmonic convergence
is upon us again.

18
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:09,975
- I'm not going to let you
fuse with Unalaq.

19
00:01:09,976 --> 00:01:14,976
You're going right back in that prison.

20
00:01:22,421 --> 00:01:24,689
Aah!

21
00:01:24,690 --> 00:01:25,957
Aah!

22
00:01:25,958 --> 00:01:28,059
- Don't let Unalaq
back in the spirit world!

23
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:33,060
- We're on it!

24
00:01:37,203 --> 00:01:39,538
- Jinora.

25
00:01:39,539 --> 00:01:41,673
Jinora's spirit,
do you hear me?

26
00:01:41,674 --> 00:01:43,909
It's your Uncle Bumi.

27
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:46,077
- Ah, this isn't working.

28
00:01:46,078 --> 00:01:48,647
We can't just randomly
wander the spirit world,

29
00:01:48,648 --> 00:01:51,349
call out for Jinora,
and expect to find her!

30
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:55,120
- We just need to employ
the simple rules of tracking.

31
00:01:55,121 --> 00:01:57,088
First we locate
her footprints...

32
00:01:57,089 --> 00:01:58,890
then we follow them.

33
00:01:58,891 --> 00:02:02,360
- Do you even know what
spirit footprints look like?

34
00:02:02,361 --> 00:02:06,431
Do spirits even leave footprints?

35
00:02:06,432 --> 00:02:11,036
Face it, your tracking skills
won't work in the spirit world.

36
00:02:11,037 --> 00:02:13,505
Let me try something.

37
00:02:13,506 --> 00:02:18,506
Ommmmm

38
00:02:19,779 --> 00:02:21,980
Jinora is over there.

39
00:02:21,981 --> 00:02:25,050
I feel a lot of spiritual energy
coming from that direction.

40
00:02:25,051 --> 00:02:26,918
- We're in the spirit world.

41
00:02:26,919 --> 00:02:29,888
There's spiritual energy
in every direction!

42
00:02:29,889 --> 00:02:31,223
- Enough!

43
00:02:31,224 --> 00:02:33,491
We can't do this by ourselves.

44
00:02:33,492 --> 00:02:38,492
We need a spirit guide.

45
00:02:40,299 --> 00:02:43,935
There!

46
00:02:43,936 --> 00:02:45,804
Spirit, hello.

47
00:02:45,805 --> 00:02:47,339
I'm sorry to disturb you,

48
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:49,674
but I am in need
of your assistance.

49
00:02:49,675 --> 00:02:54,346
You dare wake me, human?

50
00:02:54,347 --> 00:02:56,815
Humans in the spirit world

51
00:02:56,816 --> 00:03:00,518
belong in one place only!

52
00:03:02,421 --> 00:03:04,923
- Aah!
- Aah!

53
00:03:04,924 --> 00:03:07,125
- Whoa-oa-oa!

54
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:16,230
- Oof!

55
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:23,742
- Well, that didn't work.

56
00:03:23,743 --> 00:03:24,943
Now where are we?

57
00:03:24,944 --> 00:03:29,944
- We're completely lost.

58
00:03:52,738 --> 00:03:57,738
- Oh! Uhh!

59
00:04:00,646 --> 00:04:05,646
No!

60
00:04:26,806 --> 00:04:31,806
- Huh?

61
00:04:39,885 --> 00:04:41,553
I don't know if we can win this fight.

62
00:04:41,554 --> 00:04:43,088
- We don't need to win.

63
00:04:43,089 --> 00:04:44,656
We just need to stop Unalaq

64
00:04:44,657 --> 00:04:47,025
from getting back
in the spirit world.

65
00:04:47,026 --> 00:04:52,026
Huh?

66
00:04:57,536 --> 00:05:00,105
- We're walking in circles!

67
00:05:00,106 --> 00:05:03,241
I've seen that same
spirit mushroom five times!

68
00:05:03,242 --> 00:05:04,743
- That's not the same mushroom.

69
00:05:04,744 --> 00:05:06,211
- Yes, I am.

70
00:05:06,212 --> 00:05:08,480
- See?
Even it knows we're lost.

71
00:05:08,481 --> 00:05:11,616
- Oh, sure, listen to a fungus
over your own brother.

72
00:05:11,617 --> 00:05:13,752
- What's that?

73
00:05:13,753 --> 00:05:15,720
- Mushroom, is that you?

74
00:05:15,721 --> 00:05:19,224
- Nope.
Wasn't me.

75
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:22,861
- lroh?

76
00:05:22,862 --> 00:05:24,963
- How... where...

77
00:05:24,964 --> 00:05:26,664
it's been so long.

78
00:05:26,665 --> 00:05:28,900
- Almost 40 years.

79
00:05:28,901 --> 00:05:31,403
It's nice to see you again.

80
00:05:31,404 --> 00:05:33,071
- How did you know we were here?

81
00:05:33,072 --> 00:05:36,307
- My friendly spirit fox
told me you were lost.

82
00:05:36,308 --> 00:05:38,777
I came to show you the way out.

83
00:05:38,778 --> 00:05:40,645
- lroh, we are grateful,

84
00:05:40,646 --> 00:05:42,380
but we're not
looking for the way out--

85
00:05:42,381 --> 00:05:44,449
we're looking for my daughter.

86
00:05:44,450 --> 00:05:48,353
- I'm sorry to hear that,
but you shouldn't be here.

87
00:05:48,354 --> 00:05:49,587
Vaatu has escaped,

88
00:05:49,588 --> 00:05:52,057
and darkness threatens to take over.

89
00:05:52,058 --> 00:05:54,626
- I'm not leaving until I find Jinora.

90
00:05:54,627 --> 00:05:56,461
- I understand.

91
00:05:56,462 --> 00:05:59,130
But I beg you to be careful.

92
00:05:59,131 --> 00:06:01,966
If you travel too deep
into the spirit world,

93
00:06:01,967 --> 00:06:03,568
you could end up in a place

94
00:06:03,569 --> 00:06:08,569
where only the lost will ever find you.

95
00:06:15,514 --> 00:06:19,284
- A place where only the lost
can find you...

96
00:06:19,285 --> 00:06:20,852
that's it!

97
00:06:20,853 --> 00:06:22,821
I know where to find Jinora!

98
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:53,384
- I'm locking you away

99
00:06:53,385 --> 00:06:58,385
for another 10,000 years, Vaatu!

100
00:07:07,666 --> 00:07:10,969
- Unalaq?

101
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:15,039
Are you out there?

102
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:19,077
He must have gone home?

103
00:07:19,078 --> 00:07:22,480
- Hello,
my feeble turtle-duck.

104
00:07:22,481 --> 00:07:24,516
- Aah!

105
00:07:24,517 --> 00:07:29,517
- Huh?

106
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:43,430
- Don't let them escape this time.

107
00:07:43,836 --> 00:07:48,006
- Are you sure this
is the best way to find Jinora?

108
00:07:48,007 --> 00:07:51,376
- Trust me.

109
00:07:51,377 --> 00:07:54,245
Hey, you, spirit--
wake up!

110
00:07:54,246 --> 00:07:56,181
- You again?

111
00:08:13,899 --> 00:08:15,733
- I thought we were going to be
taken to a prison.

112
00:08:15,734 --> 00:08:17,569
- This is a prison.

113
00:08:17,570 --> 00:08:21,873
- Welcome
to the Fog of Lost Souls.

114
00:08:21,874 --> 00:08:25,743
You will never escape.

115
00:09:08,187 --> 00:09:09,420
- Aah!

116
00:09:22,067 --> 00:09:27,067
- Stop!

117
00:10:03,709 --> 00:10:08,709
. No!

118
00:10:16,822 --> 00:10:21,822
- We are now one.

119
00:10:22,261 --> 00:10:25,863
- Now a new era for spirits
and humans will begin,

120
00:10:25,864 --> 00:10:29,300
and I will lead them all
as the new Avatar.

121
00:10:29,301 --> 00:10:34,301
- Well, I'm the old Avatar,
and my era's not over yet.

122
00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:41,846
- What kind of prison
doesn't have any bars or walls?

123
00:10:41,847 --> 00:10:44,482
We could walk right out of here.

124
00:10:44,483 --> 00:10:47,885
- The Fog of Lost Souls
is a spirit prison for humans.

125
00:10:47,886 --> 00:10:50,655
I read about it in an ancient text.

126
00:10:50,656 --> 00:10:53,391
The fog is actually a spirit...
- [gasps]

127
00:10:53,392 --> 00:10:56,394
- That infects your mind
and slowly drives you mad,

128
00:10:56,395 --> 00:11:00,031
imprisoning you
in your own darkest memories.

129
00:11:00,032 --> 00:11:02,500
- How long can you
be trapped in here?

130
00:11:02,501 --> 00:11:04,802
- I am Zhao the Conqueror!

131
00:11:04,803 --> 00:11:06,504
I am the Moonslayer!

132
00:11:06,505 --> 00:11:09,073
I will capture the Avatar!

133
00:11:09,074 --> 00:11:10,708
I am Zhao the Conqueror!

134
00:11:10,709 --> 00:11:12,710
I am the Moonslayer!

135
00:11:12,711 --> 00:11:15,246
I will capture the Avatar!

136
00:11:15,247 --> 00:11:18,383
- Hopefully we're not trapped
in here as long as that guy.

137
00:11:18,384 --> 00:11:20,985
- You!
You're him!

138
00:11:20,986 --> 00:11:23,554
The last Airbender!

139
00:11:23,555 --> 00:11:24,989
- Ah!
No!

140
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:25,890
Get off me!

141
00:11:25,891 --> 00:11:29,894
- You've grown...
but I will still defeat you!

142
00:11:29,895 --> 00:11:34,265
Ah!
Ohh!

143
00:11:34,266 --> 00:11:37,268
Come back, Avatar!
Face me!

144
00:11:37,269 --> 00:11:39,470
I am Zhao the Conqueror!

145
00:11:39,471 --> 00:11:42,173
I will capture you!

146
00:11:42,174 --> 00:11:44,742
Victory will be mine!
[voice echoing]

147
00:11:44,743 --> 00:11:46,377
- If we stay together,

148
00:11:46,378 --> 00:11:51,378
we'll find Jinora
and make it out of this fog.

149
00:12:29,121 --> 00:12:33,925
Aah!

150
00:12:42,935 --> 00:12:46,270
- Give in.
Your time is over.

151
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:55,513
- Korra, this fight is not over.

152
00:12:55,514 --> 00:12:57,915
Raava...

153
00:12:57,916 --> 00:13:00,351
- Vaatu cannot win.

154
00:13:00,352 --> 00:13:04,789
Do not give in
to 10,000 years of darkness.

155
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:09,790
You are the Avatar.

156
00:13:11,530 --> 00:13:16,530
- Aah!

157
00:13:20,005 --> 00:13:25,005
- You cannot win!

158
00:13:30,649 --> 00:13:34,685
- Jinora! Jinora!

159
00:13:34,686 --> 00:13:36,521
- Wait a second.
- What?

160
00:13:36,522 --> 00:13:37,989
Do you hear something?

161
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:41,459
- Yes.
They're all around us.

162
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:43,995
The cannibals,
they're everywhere.

163
00:13:43,996 --> 00:13:47,031
- Bumi, you must
focus your mind right now.

164
00:13:47,032 --> 00:13:48,966
There are no cannibals.

165
00:13:48,967 --> 00:13:50,635
- Yes, there are!

166
00:13:50,636 --> 00:13:53,037
They're gonna eat
every last one of us!

167
00:13:53,038 --> 00:13:56,841
Who are you two?!

168
00:13:56,842 --> 00:13:58,509
- Kya, we're your brothers.

169
00:13:58,510 --> 00:14:01,212
You must remember
before the fog infects you.

170
00:14:01,213 --> 00:14:04,649
- No, you are just a vision.
I have no family.

171
00:14:04,650 --> 00:14:06,350
You can't tie me down!

172
00:14:06,351 --> 00:14:08,553
- They're closing in!

173
00:14:08,554 --> 00:14:11,188
I gotta get outta here! Aah!

174
00:14:11,189 --> 00:14:16,189
' Aah!
' No!

175
00:14:16,361 --> 00:14:18,129
Bumi! Kya!

176
00:14:18,130 --> 00:14:23,130
Come back!

177
00:14:30,542 --> 00:14:32,276
- Please, let us out.

178
00:14:32,277 --> 00:14:35,012
- His groveling is pathetic.

179
00:14:35,013 --> 00:14:38,449
- But I do enjoy
the sweet scent of desperation.

180
00:14:38,450 --> 00:14:39,650
- Come on!

181
00:14:39,651 --> 00:14:41,752
Your dad has become
an evil monster.

182
00:14:41,753 --> 00:14:44,522
He's trying to bring on
eternal darkness!

183
00:14:44,523 --> 00:14:45,957
Why would you protect someone

184
00:14:45,958 --> 00:14:48,626
who doesn't care about you at all?

185
00:14:48,627 --> 00:14:51,462
- Father was going to let me expire

186
00:14:51,463 --> 00:14:53,931
when we tried to open
the northern portal.

187
00:14:53,932 --> 00:14:56,601
Perhaps we should
rethink our position.

188
00:14:56,602 --> 00:14:58,336
- Yes!
- No.

189
00:14:58,337 --> 00:15:00,104
Don't listen to him.

190
00:15:00,105 --> 00:15:02,540
His words are poisoning your mind.

191
00:15:05,978 --> 00:15:08,512
- What's with this outburst of emotion?

192
00:15:08,513 --> 00:15:11,549
- I'm sorry, I can't help it.

193
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:13,451
It's just so sad...

194
00:15:13,452 --> 00:15:16,120
that I'll never get to be
with you again.

195
00:15:16,121 --> 00:15:17,622
- What?

196
00:15:17,623 --> 00:15:19,957
Explain yourself further.

197
00:15:19,958 --> 00:15:22,460
- Eska,
I've always loved you,

198
00:15:22,461 --> 00:15:24,528
and I've always wanted to be with you...

199
00:15:24,529 --> 00:15:26,197
but now that the world is ending,

200
00:15:26,198 --> 00:15:30,468
I'm never gonna get that chance.

201
00:15:30,469 --> 00:15:32,269
- We could have been together,

202
00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:34,005
but you left me at the altar.

203
00:15:34,006 --> 00:15:35,906
- I was scared!

204
00:15:35,907 --> 00:15:38,743
I was scared
of my true feelings for you.

205
00:15:38,744 --> 00:15:41,879
I should have never left you!
I'm sorry.

206
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:44,448
And I'm sorry that we'll never
have a chance to rekindle

207
00:15:44,449 --> 00:15:47,084
the dying ember
that was our love into a...

208
00:15:47,085 --> 00:15:50,254
big fire of love flames.

209
00:16:04,770 --> 00:16:06,904
- You'll never defeat my father.

210
00:16:06,905 --> 00:16:10,007
But should you survive,

211
00:16:10,008 --> 00:16:15,008
perhaps we can spend
eternal darkness together.

212
00:16:16,181 --> 00:16:18,916
- Wow, that was
the best acting I've ever seen.

213
00:16:18,917 --> 00:16:20,651
You completely fooled her!

214
00:16:20,652 --> 00:16:25,652
- Yeah, right, that-- that was acting.

215
00:16:27,626 --> 00:16:32,626
- They will certainly perish.

216
00:18:12,564 --> 00:18:14,865
- I must stay focused.

217
00:18:14,866 --> 00:18:16,634
Remember who you are, Tenzin.

218
00:18:16,635 --> 00:18:18,669
You are the son of Avatar Aang.

219
00:18:18,670 --> 00:18:20,037
You are the hope

220
00:18:20,038 --> 00:18:22,206
for future generations of Airbenders.

221
00:18:22,207 --> 00:18:24,875
The fate of the world
rests on your shoulders.

222
00:18:24,876 --> 00:18:29,046
But what if I fail?

223
00:18:29,047 --> 00:18:32,383
Then your father's hope
for the future dies with you.

224
00:18:32,384 --> 00:18:33,551
I can't fail!

225
00:18:33,552 --> 00:18:34,618
You will.

226
00:18:34,619 --> 00:18:36,587
Aah!
Stop it!

227
00:18:36,588 --> 00:18:39,423
I am the son of Avatar Aang.

228
00:18:39,424 --> 00:18:42,860
I am the hope for future
generations of Airbenders.

229
00:18:42,861 --> 00:18:45,930
I am the son of Avatar Aang!

230
00:18:45,931 --> 00:18:50,931
- Hello, my son.

231
00:18:51,236 --> 00:18:53,904
- Dad, I've failed you.

232
00:18:53,905 --> 00:18:56,373
I am no spiritual leader,

233
00:18:56,374 --> 00:18:58,909
and I've let the world down.

234
00:18:58,910 --> 00:19:01,745
I'll never be the man you were.

235
00:19:01,746 --> 00:19:04,381
- You are right.

236
00:19:04,382 --> 00:19:05,583
You are trying to hold on

237
00:19:05,584 --> 00:19:08,853
to a false perception of yourself.

238
00:19:08,854 --> 00:19:12,656
You are not me,
and you should not be me.

239
00:19:12,657 --> 00:19:17,657
You are Tenzin.

240
00:19:23,034 --> 00:19:26,170
- I am not a reflection of my father.

241
00:19:26,171 --> 00:19:31,171
I am Tenzin.
I am Tenzin.

242
00:19:40,285 --> 00:19:45,285
Jinora!

243
00:20:01,973 --> 00:20:03,140
- Ah...

244
00:20:03,141 --> 00:20:05,309
what happened?

245
00:20:05,310 --> 00:20:09,013
- I think our brother saved us.

246
00:20:09,014 --> 00:20:10,047
- Dad.

247
00:20:10,048 --> 00:20:11,749
- You're going to be okay, sweetie.

248
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:14,184
I'm here.
- What happened?

249
00:20:14,185 --> 00:20:15,619
The last thing I remember

250
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:18,289
is dark spirits taking me away.

251
00:20:18,290 --> 00:20:20,758
- You were trapped
in the Fog of Lost Souls,

252
00:20:20,759 --> 00:20:23,360
but I wasn't going
to let you stay there.

253
00:20:23,361 --> 00:20:28,361
- I'm so happy to see you, Dad.

254
00:20:35,974 --> 00:20:37,007
- Korra!

255
00:20:37,008 --> 00:20:42,008
- He's got the light spirit!

256
00:20:48,687 --> 00:20:53,687
Aah!

257
00:21:22,387 --> 00:21:27,387
Aah!

258
00:21:59,958 --> 00:22:02,226
- The world's in trouble.

259
00:22:02,227 --> 00:22:04,428
- What are you talking about?
How do you know?

260
00:22:04,429 --> 00:22:05,796
- I can feel it.

261
00:22:05,797 --> 00:22:09,266
- What happened?
- It's Korra.

262
00:22:09,267 --> 00:22:12,469
This light spirit will guide you
out of the spirit world.

263
00:22:12,470 --> 00:22:16,473
I have to go help.

264
00:22:16,474 --> 00:22:19,910
- Jinora, wait!

265
00:22:47,272 --> 00:22:49,173
- Now...

266
00:22:49,174 --> 00:22:54,174
10,000 years of darkness begins!

267
00:23:06,391 --> 00:23:11,391
Aah!
