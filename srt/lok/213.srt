1
00:00:07,709 --> 00:00:08,417
- EARTH...

2
00:00:08,458 --> 00:00:10,625
FIRE...

3
00:00:10,667 --> 00:00:12,291
AIR...

4
00:00:12,333 --> 00:00:14,458
WATER.

5
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:18,375
ONLY THE AVATAR
CAN MASTER ALL FOUR ELEMENTS

6
00:00:18,417 --> 00:00:21,166
AND BRING BALANCE
TO THE WORLD.

7
00:00:27,208 --> 00:00:28,208
- AFTER 10,000 YEARS,

8
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:29,834
HARMONIC CONVERGENCE
IS HERE AGAIN,

9
00:00:29,875 --> 00:00:32,750
AND THE DARK SPIRIT VAATU
IS FREE.

10
00:00:32,792 --> 00:00:34,750
TENZIN, BUMI, AND KYA
HAVE ENTERED THE PORTAL

11
00:00:34,792 --> 00:00:36,709
TO RESCUE JINORA'S SPIRIT.

12
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:38,125
ASAMI SPLIT FROM THE GROUP

13
00:00:38,166 --> 00:00:40,083
AND TOOK
THE INJURED TONRAQ TO SAFETY.

14
00:00:40,125 --> 00:00:43,291
SO IT'S UP TO KORRA, MAKO,
AND BOLIN TO STOP UNALAQ

15
00:00:43,333 --> 00:00:46,542
BEFORE HE FUSES WITH VAATU
AND BECOMES A DARK AVATAR!

16
00:00:57,959 --> 00:01:02,375
- RAAVA, NOTHING
COULD STOP THIS MOMENT.

17
00:01:02,417 --> 00:01:07,041
HARMONIC CONVERGENCE
IS UPON US AGAIN.

18
00:01:07,083 --> 00:01:09,583
- I'M NOT GOING TO LET YOU
FUSE WITH UNALAQ.

19
00:01:09,625 --> 00:01:11,542
YOU'RE GOING RIGHT BACK
IN THAT PRISON.

20
00:01:20,875 --> 00:01:21,875
- [grunts]

21
00:01:21,917 --> 00:01:24,208
AAH!

22
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:25,959
AAH!

23
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,667
- DON'T LET UNALAQ
BACK IN THE SPIRIT WORLD!

24
00:01:27,709 --> 00:01:28,959
- WE'RE ON IT!

25
00:01:36,875 --> 00:01:39,250
- JINORA.

26
00:01:39,291 --> 00:01:41,166
JINORA'S SPIRIT,
DO YOU HEAR ME?

27
00:01:41,208 --> 00:01:43,458
IT'S YOUR UNCLE BUMI.

28
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:45,917
- AH, THIS ISN'T WORKING.

29
00:01:45,959 --> 00:01:48,375
WE CAN'T JUST RANDOMLY
WANDER THE SPIRIT WORLD,

30
00:01:48,417 --> 00:01:51,000
CALL OUT FOR JINORA,
AND EXPECT TO FIND HER!

31
00:01:51,041 --> 00:01:54,750
- WE JUST NEED TO EMPLOY
THE SIMPLE RULES OF TRACKING.

32
00:01:54,792 --> 00:01:56,709
FIRST WE LOCATE
HER FOOTPRINTS...

33
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:58,709
THEN WE FOLLOW THEM.

34
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:02,125
- DO YOU EVEN KNOW WHAT
SPIRIT FOOTPRINTS LOOK LIKE?

35
00:02:02,166 --> 00:02:05,333
DO SPIRITS EVEN
LEAVE FOOTPRINTS?

36
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:09,750
FACE IT, YOUR TRACKING SKILLS
WON'T WORK IN THE SPIRIT WORLD.

37
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:12,333
LET ME TRY SOMETHING.

38
00:02:12,375 --> 00:02:18,291
OMMMM...

39
00:02:19,417 --> 00:02:21,875
JINORA IS OVER THERE.

40
00:02:21,917 --> 00:02:24,709
I FEEL A LOT OF SPIRITUAL ENERGY
COMING FROM THAT DIRECTION.

41
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:26,792
- WE'RE IN THE SPIRIT WORLD.

42
00:02:26,834 --> 00:02:29,500
THERE'S SPIRITUAL ENERGY
IN EVERY DIRECTION!

43
00:02:29,542 --> 00:02:30,917
- ENOUGH!

44
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:33,250
WE CAN'T DO THIS BY OURSELVES.

45
00:02:33,291 --> 00:02:35,417
WE NEED A SPIRIT GUIDE.

46
00:02:39,375 --> 00:02:41,041
THERE!

47
00:02:43,625 --> 00:02:45,417
SPIRIT, HELLO.

48
00:02:45,458 --> 00:02:47,083
I'M SORRY TO DISTURB YOU,

49
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:49,500
BUT I AM IN NEED
OF YOUR ASSISTANCE.

50
00:02:49,542 --> 00:02:54,083
- [hoarse, ominous]
YOU DARE WAKE ME, HUMAN?

51
00:02:54,125 --> 00:02:56,417
HUMANS IN THE SPIRIT WORLD

52
00:02:56,458 --> 00:03:00,083
BELONG IN ONE PLACE ONLY!

53
00:03:00,125 --> 00:03:02,208
[roars]

54
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:04,583
- AAH!
- AAH!

55
00:03:04,625 --> 00:03:06,834
- WHOA-OA-OA!

56
00:03:06,875 --> 00:03:10,959
[all scream]

57
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,583
[thud]
- OOF!

58
00:03:20,542 --> 00:03:22,750
- WELL, THAT DIDN'T WORK.

59
00:03:22,792 --> 00:03:24,625
NOW WHERE ARE WE?

60
00:03:24,667 --> 00:03:27,458
- WE'RE COMPLETELY LOST.

61
00:03:52,333 --> 00:03:53,792
- OH! UHH!

62
00:04:00,333 --> 00:04:01,500
NO!

63
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:27,458
- HUH?

64
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,000
[both grunt]

65
00:04:34,959 --> 00:04:38,750
- [groans]

66
00:04:38,792 --> 00:04:41,417
I DON'T KNOW
IF WE CAN WIN THIS FIGHT.

67
00:04:41,458 --> 00:04:42,834
- WE DON'T NEED TO WIN.

68
00:04:42,875 --> 00:04:44,542
WE JUST NEED TO STOP UNALAQ

69
00:04:44,583 --> 00:04:46,750
FROM GETTING BACK
IN THE SPIRIT WORLD.

70
00:04:46,792 --> 00:04:48,709
HUH?
[ice shatters]

71
00:04:57,417 --> 00:05:00,083
- WE'RE WALKING IN CIRCLES!

72
00:05:00,125 --> 00:05:03,083
I'VE SEEN THAT SAME
SPIRIT MUSHROOM FIVE TIMES!

73
00:05:03,125 --> 00:05:04,458
- THAT'S NOT
THE SAME MUSHROOM.

74
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,041
- YES, I AM.

75
00:05:06,083 --> 00:05:08,375
- SEE?
EVEN IT KNOWS WE'RE LOST.

76
00:05:08,417 --> 00:05:11,542
- OH, SURE, LISTEN TO A FUNGUS
OVER YOUR OWN BROTHER.

77
00:05:11,583 --> 00:05:13,458
[whooshing]
- WHAT'S THAT?

78
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,417
- MUSHROOM, IS THAT YOU?

79
00:05:15,458 --> 00:05:18,917
- NOPE.
WASN'T ME.

80
00:05:18,959 --> 00:05:20,083
[all gasp]

81
00:05:21,417 --> 00:05:22,625
- IROH?

82
00:05:22,667 --> 00:05:24,750
- HOW...
WHERE...

83
00:05:24,792 --> 00:05:26,375
IT'S BEEN SO LONG.

84
00:05:26,417 --> 00:05:28,667
- ALMOST 40 YEARS.

85
00:05:28,709 --> 00:05:31,291
IT'S NICE
TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

86
00:05:31,333 --> 00:05:32,875
- HOW DID YOU KNOW
WE WERE HERE?

87
00:05:32,917 --> 00:05:36,166
- MY FRIENDLY SPIRIT FOX
TOLD ME YOU WERE LOST.

88
00:05:36,208 --> 00:05:38,500
I CAME TO SHOW YOU
THE WAY OUT.

89
00:05:38,542 --> 00:05:40,583
- IROH, WE ARE GRATEFUL,

90
00:05:40,625 --> 00:05:42,250
BUT WE'RE NOT
LOOKING FOR THE WAY OUT--

91
00:05:42,291 --> 00:05:44,333
WE'RE LOOKING FOR
MY DAUGHTER.

92
00:05:44,375 --> 00:05:48,208
- I'M SORRY TO HEAR THAT,
BUT YOU SHOULDN'T BE HERE.

93
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:49,458
VAATU HAS ESCAPED,

94
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:51,792
AND DARKNESS
THREATENS TO TAKE OVER.

95
00:05:51,834 --> 00:05:54,250
- I'M NOT LEAVING
UNTIL I FIND JINORA.

96
00:05:54,291 --> 00:05:56,291
- I UNDERSTAND.

97
00:05:56,333 --> 00:05:58,875
BUT I BEG YOU TO BE CAREFUL.

98
00:05:58,917 --> 00:06:01,750
IF YOU TRAVEL TOO DEEP
INTO THE SPIRIT WORLD,

99
00:06:01,792 --> 00:06:03,542
YOU COULD END UP IN A PLACE

100
00:06:03,583 --> 00:06:06,792
WHERE ONLY THE LOST
WILL EVER FIND YOU.

101
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:19,166
- A PLACE WHERE ONLY THE LOST
CAN FIND YOU...

102
00:06:19,208 --> 00:06:20,625
THAT'S IT!

103
00:06:20,667 --> 00:06:22,583
I KNOW WHERE
TO FIND JINORA!

104
00:06:22,625 --> 00:06:25,041
- [grunting]

105
00:06:51,166 --> 00:06:53,291
- I'M LOCKING YOU AWAY

106
00:06:53,333 --> 00:06:56,792
FOR ANOTHER 10,000 YEARS,
VAATU!

107
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:10,291
- UNALAQ?

108
00:07:10,333 --> 00:07:13,000
ARE YOU OUT THERE?

109
00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:16,875
HE MUST HAVE GONE HOME?

110
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,208
- HELLO,
MY FEEBLE TURTLE-DUCK.

111
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:24,250
- AAH!

112
00:07:24,291 --> 00:07:25,792
- HUH?

113
00:07:37,875 --> 00:07:40,500
- DON'T LET THEM ESCAPE
THIS TIME.

114
00:07:43,959 --> 00:07:47,875
- ARE YOU SURE THIS
IS THE BEST WAY TO FIND JINORA?

115
00:07:47,917 --> 00:07:50,041
- TRUST ME.

116
00:07:51,375 --> 00:07:54,166
HEY, YOU, SPIRIT--
WAKE UP!

117
00:07:54,208 --> 00:07:56,083
- YOU AGAIN?

118
00:07:56,125 --> 00:07:58,667
[shrieks]

119
00:08:13,166 --> 00:08:16,000
- I THOUGHT WE WERE GOING TO BE
TAKEN TO A PRISON.

120
00:08:16,041 --> 00:08:17,625
- THIS IS A PRISON.

121
00:08:17,667 --> 00:08:21,750
- WELCOME TO THE FOG
OF LOST SOULS.

122
00:08:21,792 --> 00:08:25,583
YOU WILL NEVER ESCAPE.

123
00:08:25,625 --> 00:08:29,041
[all screaming]

124
00:08:46,625 --> 00:08:48,667
- [grunting]

125
00:09:08,208 --> 00:09:09,208
- AAH!

126
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:10,875
[grunts]

127
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:22,959
- STOP!

128
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,250
- [grunts]

129
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,709
- [groaning]

130
00:09:59,792 --> 00:10:03,625
[screams]

131
00:10:03,667 --> 00:10:04,583
- NO!

132
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:19,625
- WE ARE NOW ONE.

133
00:10:22,792 --> 00:10:25,583
- NOW A NEW ERA FOR SPIRITS
AND HUMANS WILL BEGIN,

134
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:29,125
AND I WILL LEAD THEM ALL
AS THE NEW AVATAR.

135
00:10:29,166 --> 00:10:32,792
- WELL, I'M THE OLD AVATAR,
AND MY ERA'S NOT OVER YET.

136
00:10:38,166 --> 00:10:41,542
- WHAT KIND OF PRISON
DOESN'T HAVE ANY BARS OR WALLS?

137
00:10:41,583 --> 00:10:44,333
WE COULD WALK
RIGHT OUT OF HERE.

138
00:10:44,375 --> 00:10:47,583
- THE FOG OF LOST SOULS
IS A SPIRIT PRISON FOR HUMANS.

139
00:10:47,625 --> 00:10:50,291
I READ ABOUT IT
IN AN ANCIENT TEXT.

140
00:10:50,333 --> 00:10:53,208
THE FOG IS ACTUALLY A SPIRIT...
- [gasps]

141
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:56,000
- THAT INFECTS YOUR MIND
AND SLOWLY DRIVES YOU MAD,

142
00:10:56,041 --> 00:10:59,792
IMPRISONING YOU
IN YOUR OWN DARKEST MEMORIES.

143
00:10:59,834 --> 00:11:02,208
- HOW LONG CAN YOU
BE TRAPPED IN HERE?

144
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:04,583
- I AM ZHAO THE CONQUEROR!

145
00:11:04,625 --> 00:11:06,208
I AM THE MOONSLAYER!

146
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:08,667
I WILL CAPTURE THE AVATAR!

147
00:11:08,709 --> 00:11:10,458
I AM ZHAO THE CONQUEROR!

148
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,458
I AM THE MOONSLAYER!

149
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:15,125
I WILL CAPTURE THE AVATAR!

150
00:11:15,166 --> 00:11:18,041
- HOPEFULLY WE'RE NOT TRAPPED
IN HERE AS LONG AS THAT GUY.

151
00:11:18,083 --> 00:11:20,542
- YOU!
YOU'RE HIM!

152
00:11:20,583 --> 00:11:22,291
THE LAST AIRBENDER!

153
00:11:22,333 --> 00:11:24,000
- AH!
NO!

154
00:11:24,041 --> 00:11:25,667
GET OFF ME!

155
00:11:25,709 --> 00:11:29,417
- YOU'VE GROWN...
BUT I WILL STILL DEFEAT YOU!

156
00:11:29,458 --> 00:11:31,667
AH!
OHH!

157
00:11:33,917 --> 00:11:36,875
COME BACK, AVATAR!
FACE ME!

158
00:11:36,917 --> 00:11:39,166
I AM ZHAO THE CONQUEROR!

159
00:11:39,208 --> 00:11:42,041
I WILL CAPTURE YOU!

160
00:11:42,083 --> 00:11:44,500
VICTORY WILL BE MINE!
[voice echoing]

161
00:11:44,542 --> 00:11:46,000
- IF WE STAY TOGETHER,

162
00:11:46,041 --> 00:11:49,792
WE'LL FIND JINORA
AND MAKE IT OUT OF THIS FOG.

163
00:12:16,625 --> 00:12:19,709
- [grunting]

164
00:12:28,834 --> 00:12:31,917
AAH!
[groans]

165
00:12:33,583 --> 00:12:35,583
[struggling]

166
00:12:38,583 --> 00:12:40,250
[ground rumbling]

167
00:12:40,291 --> 00:12:42,750
[grunts]

168
00:12:42,792 --> 00:12:45,917
- GIVE IN.
YOUR TIME IS OVER.

169
00:12:45,959 --> 00:12:48,875
- [groans]

170
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:55,208
- KORRA,
THIS FIGHT IS NOT OVER.

171
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:57,458
- [whispers]
RAAVA...

172
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:00,250
- VAATU CANNOT WIN.

173
00:13:00,291 --> 00:13:04,667
DO NOT GIVE IN
TO 10,000 YEARS OF DARKNESS.

174
00:13:04,709 --> 00:13:06,834
YOU ARE THE AVATAR.

175
00:13:11,375 --> 00:13:13,375
- AAH!

176
00:13:19,709 --> 00:13:21,917
- YOU CANNOT WIN!

177
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:32,583
- JINORA!

178
00:13:32,625 --> 00:13:34,500
JINORA!

179
