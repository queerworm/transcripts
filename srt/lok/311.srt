1
00:00:07,417 --> 00:00:08,583
- EARTH.

2
00:00:08,625 --> 00:00:10,500
FIRE.

3
00:00:10,542 --> 00:00:12,208
AIR.

4
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:14,417
WATER.

5
00:00:14,458 --> 00:00:18,500
ONLY THE AVATAR CAN MASTER
ALL FOUR ELEMENTS

6
00:00:18,542 --> 00:00:21,208
AND BRING BALANCE
TO THE WORLD.

7
00:00:27,041 --> 00:00:28,417
- BA SING SE HAS FALLEN!

8
00:00:28,458 --> 00:00:31,000
AFTER ZAHEER AND THE RED LOTUS
TOPPLED THE EARTH QUEEN,

9
00:00:31,041 --> 00:00:32,500
THE CITY DESCENDED INTO CHAOS.

10
00:00:32,542 --> 00:00:34,875
MEANWHILE, KORRA AND ASAMI
TRIED TO ESCAPE THEIR CAPTORS

11
00:00:34,917 --> 00:00:36,291
BUT CRASHED IN THE DESERT.

12
00:00:36,333 --> 00:00:37,917
AFTER GETTING TO SAFETY,
THEY MET UP

13
00:00:37,959 --> 00:00:39,917
WITH LORD ZUKO, TONRAQ,
AND BEIFONG.

14
00:00:39,959 --> 00:00:42,458
BACK IN BA SING SE,
ZAHEER FREED MAKO AND BOLIN,

15
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:44,709
GIVING THEM A VITAL MESSAGE
TO DELIVER TO KORRA.

16
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:46,750
BUT WILL THE BROTHERS
FIND HER IN TIME?

17
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:02,000
- I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.
THE UPPER RING IS IN CHAOS.

18
00:01:02,041 --> 00:01:05,291
- DON'T TRY TO STOP US.
WE'RE TAKING BACK WHAT'S OURS.

19
00:01:05,333 --> 00:01:07,500
- STOP YOU?
I'M GONNA JOIN YOU.

20
00:01:07,542 --> 00:01:11,125
I KNOW WHERE THE GOOD STUFF IS.

21
00:01:11,166 --> 00:01:13,583
- SHOULD WE DO SOMETHING?
- THIS ISN'T OUR BATTLE.

22
00:01:13,625 --> 00:01:16,250
WE HAVE TO DELIVER ZAHEER'S
MESSAGE TO KORRA IMMEDIATELY.

23
00:01:16,291 --> 00:01:18,917
- RIGHT. OKAY.
FIND KORRA, DELIVER MESSAGE.

24
00:01:18,959 --> 00:01:20,000
YEAH, THIS SHOULD BE EASY.

25
00:01:20,041 --> 00:01:21,500
WE JUST GOTTA GET
OUT OF THE CITY

26
00:01:21,542 --> 00:01:23,458
AND GET TO THE DESERT,
THEN SOMEHOW FIND HER

27
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:25,875
IN THE VAST, EXPANSIVE WASTELAND
THAT GOES ON FOR THOUSANDS

28
00:01:25,917 --> 00:01:28,083
AND THOUSANDS OF MILES.

29
00:01:28,125 --> 00:01:31,875
[sighs]
THIS ISN'T GONNA BE EASY.

30
00:01:31,917 --> 00:01:34,208
- WE NEED AN AIRSHIP.

31
00:01:39,166 --> 00:01:41,083
- OOH!

32
00:01:41,125 --> 00:01:43,834
- EXCUSE ME, MAY I HAVE
YOUR ATTENTION PLEASE?

33
00:01:43,875 --> 00:01:46,000
I'M WITH
THE REPUBLIC CITY POLICE,

34
00:01:46,041 --> 00:01:48,709
AND I NEED TO COMMANDEER
THIS AIRSHIP TO HELP THE AVATAR.

35
00:01:53,333 --> 00:01:55,375
- LET ME GIVE IT A SHOT.

36
00:01:55,417 --> 00:01:57,583
HEY, THE QUEEN'S GOLD IS ON
THE THIRD FLOOR OF THE PALACE!

37
00:01:57,625 --> 00:01:59,542
SECOND DOOR ON THE RIGHT!

38
00:02:01,542 --> 00:02:03,542
YOU JUST GOTTA KNOW
HOW TO TALK TO THEM, BRO.

39
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:07,417
- THEY TOOK EVERYTHING.

40
00:02:07,458 --> 00:02:09,667
I MEAN, WHO RIPS OUT
A TRANSMISSION RADIO?

41
00:02:09,709 --> 00:02:11,625
- SOME FOLKS JUST
DO NOT HAVE RESPECT

42
00:02:11,667 --> 00:02:13,417
FOR OTHER PEOPLE'S PROPERTY.

43
00:02:13,458 --> 00:02:15,917
NOW LET'S STEAL THIS AIRSHIP!

44
00:02:15,959 --> 00:02:17,291
- YOU KNOW HOW
TO FLY THIS THING?

45
00:02:17,333 --> 00:02:19,667
- TECHNICALLY SPEAKING?
NO.

46
00:02:19,709 --> 00:02:23,166
BUT, COME ON,
HOW HARD CAN IT BE?

47
00:02:23,208 --> 00:02:24,792
[all scream]

48
00:02:24,834 --> 00:02:26,834
- UP! UP!

49
00:02:26,875 --> 00:02:29,291
- I DON'T SEE ANY "UP" BUTTON.
I SEE LEVERS AND SWITCHES.

50
00:02:29,333 --> 00:02:31,500
OH, THERE IT IS.

51
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:41,250
- THE WHOLE CITY
IS FALLING TO PIECES.

52
00:02:41,291 --> 00:02:43,083
- MAKO, OUR FAMILY'S DOWN THERE.

53
00:02:43,125 --> 00:02:44,625
- MOVE OVER.
- AHH!

54
00:02:44,667 --> 00:02:46,208
- WE'RE GETTING THEM OUT.

55
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:48,709
- OH, YOU THINK
JUST BECAUSE YOU DATED ASAMI,

56
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:50,166
YOU KNOW HOW TO FLY THIS
BETTER THAN ME?

57
00:02:50,208 --> 00:02:52,667
- YEAH.

58
00:03:01,542 --> 00:03:03,750
- BOLIN?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

59
00:03:03,792 --> 00:03:05,291
- I CAME TO GET YOU GUYS OUT.

60
00:03:05,333 --> 00:03:07,291
THIS WHOLE BLOCK
IS ABOUT TO GO UP IN FLAMES.

61
00:03:07,333 --> 00:03:09,834
COME ON, MAKO AND I
HAVE AN AIRSHIP ON THE ROOF.

62
00:03:09,875 --> 00:03:12,333
- WE CAN'T.
GRANDMA WON'T GO.

63
00:03:12,375 --> 00:03:17,417
- THIS PLACE IS MY WHOLE WORLD.
I WILL NOT LEAVE.

64
00:03:17,458 --> 00:03:21,875
OH, BUT I'M SO GLAD MY LITTLE
BOLIN HAS COME BACK TO VISIT.

65
00:03:21,917 --> 00:03:24,125
SIT DOWN.
WOULD YOU LIKE SOME TEA?

66
00:03:24,166 --> 00:03:26,000
- GRANDMA, WE DON'T HAVE TIME
FOR TEA.

67
00:03:26,041 --> 00:03:28,583
- MOM, PLEASE.
- NO!

68
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:31,542
I CAN'T ABANDON THE PLACE
WHERE I RAISED MY FAMILY.

69
00:03:31,583 --> 00:03:33,625
IT'S MY HOME.

70
00:03:33,667 --> 00:03:35,750
- GRANDMA, THERE'S ONE THING
THAT MAKO AND I HAVE LEARNED

71
00:03:35,792 --> 00:03:38,000
FROM ALL OUR YEARS
ON THE STREET:

72
00:03:38,041 --> 00:03:39,834
IT DOESN'T MATTER
WHERE YOU GO.

73
00:03:39,875 --> 00:03:42,750
IF YOU HAVE YOUR FAMILY
WITH YOU,

74
00:03:42,792 --> 00:03:45,417
YOU'LL ALWAYS BE AT HOME.

75
00:03:45,458 --> 00:03:47,333
- I'M NOT GOING.

76
00:03:47,375 --> 00:03:49,417
- FINE!
YOU LEAVE ME NO CHOICE.

77
00:03:49,458 --> 00:03:51,250
WE'RE ROLLING OUT!

78
00:03:51,291 --> 00:03:53,917
- [gasps] WAIT.

79
00:03:53,959 --> 00:03:56,166
OKAY, LET'S GO.

80
00:04:12,166 --> 00:04:14,458
- THANKS FOR GETTING US
OUT OF THERE.

81
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:16,458
I MEAN, I PROBABLY COULD HAVE
HANDLED IT MYSELF

82
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:21,000
IF YOU GUYS DIDN'T SHOW UP,
BUT THANKS.

83
00:04:23,625 --> 00:04:27,333
- [kisses]
MAY SHE REST IN PEACE.

84
00:04:27,375 --> 00:04:30,750
THIS AIRSHIP IS NICE.
IS IT OUR NEW HOME?

85
00:04:30,792 --> 00:04:33,166
- NO, GRANDMA, I'M NOT SURE
WHERE WE'RE GONNA TAKE YOU.

86
00:04:33,208 --> 00:04:35,375
BUT RIGHT NOW,
WE NEED TO FIND KORRA.

87
00:04:35,417 --> 00:04:36,959
- DID SOMETHING HAPPEN
TO THE AVATAR?

88
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,542
- I'M AFRAID SO.

89
00:04:38,583 --> 00:04:40,834
HER AIRSHIP WENT DOWN
SOMEWHERE IN THE DESERT.

90
00:04:40,875 --> 00:04:43,625
SHE WAS COMING FROM A MILITARY
BASE NEAR THE MISTY PALMS OASIS

91
00:04:43,667 --> 00:04:45,959
AND HEADING TO BA SING SE.

92
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,709
IF WE RETRACE HER ROUTE
BACK TO THE BASE,

93
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:49,667
WE SHOULD FIND THE WRECKAGE.

94
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:14,125
- [snores]

95
00:05:14,166 --> 00:05:17,458
- GUYS, IT'S THE WRECKAGE.
I FOUND IT.

96
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:19,500
THERE.

97
00:05:19,542 --> 00:05:21,875
- THAT'S A BA SING SE AIRSHIP,
ALL RIGHT.

98
00:05:21,917 --> 00:05:23,667
BUT WHERE'S THE REST OF IT?

99
00:05:23,709 --> 00:05:27,041
- I DON'T KNOW,
BUT THERE ARE SOME TRACKS.

100
00:05:38,583 --> 00:05:41,250
SEE? I TOLD YOU.
LANDING IS HARD.

101
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:51,917
- [gasps] SPIRITS.

102
00:05:51,959 --> 00:05:54,291
- OKAY, GUYS, WE THINK KORRA
FOUND HER WAY BACK HERE.

103
00:05:54,333 --> 00:05:57,000
NOW LET'S SPLIT OFF INTO TEAMS
AND SCOUR THE TOWN.

104
00:05:57,041 --> 00:05:59,125
YES, WE'LL NEED YOUR HELP TOO,
PABU.

105
00:05:59,166 --> 00:06:01,166
NOW JUST GIVE ME A SECOND
WHILE I--[gasps]

106
00:06:01,208 --> 00:06:03,834
WAIT.
PABU?

107
00:06:03,875 --> 00:06:06,834
PABU!
[laughs]

108
00:06:06,875 --> 00:06:10,458
- WHY IS BOLIN HUGGING
THAT BIG RAT?

109
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:13,625
EW.
NOW HE'S KISSING IT.

110
00:06:13,667 --> 00:06:15,834
- MWAH, MWAH, MWAH, MWAH.

111
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:17,792
I'M NEVER GONNA
LET YOU GO AGAIN.

112
00:06:17,834 --> 00:06:19,667
- GUYS, LOOK OUT!
GIANT DOG-BEAST THINGY!

113
00:06:19,709 --> 00:06:22,875
[all shout]

114
00:06:22,917 --> 00:06:25,792
- OKAY, ALL RIGHT, NAGA.
IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU TOO.

115
00:06:25,834 --> 00:06:28,542
AHH, STOP.
YOU'RE LICKING MY MOUTH.

116
00:06:28,583 --> 00:06:30,417
[spits]

117
00:06:30,458 --> 00:06:32,000
- ASAMI!
KORRA!

118
00:06:32,041 --> 00:06:34,500
- YOU GUYS ARE OKAY!

119
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:41,166
SORRY, I WAS JUST--
IT'S SO GOOD TO SEE YOU.

120
00:06:41,208 --> 00:06:43,792
- IT'S REALLY GOOD TO SEE
YOU TOO, BOTH OF YOU.

121
00:06:43,834 --> 00:06:46,166
- GOOD.
YOU GUYS AREN'T DEAD.

122
00:06:46,208 --> 00:06:48,375
- DON'T GET ALL MUSHY ON ME,
CHIEF.

123
00:06:48,417 --> 00:06:51,625
TONRAQ, SIR.

124
00:06:51,667 --> 00:06:55,000
- OH, MY GOSH.
IT'S LORD ZUKO.

125
00:06:55,041 --> 00:06:58,709
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.
[whimpers]

126
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:01,166
- UH, FORGIVE MY BROTHER.

127
00:07:01,208 --> 00:07:03,500
WE'RE JUST REALLY HONORED
TO MEET YOU, SIR.

128
00:07:03,542 --> 00:07:07,041
- IT'S A PLEASURE TO MEET YOU
AS WELL.

129
00:07:07,083 --> 00:07:09,500
- YOU MUST BE THE AVATAR.

130
00:07:09,542 --> 00:07:12,125
MAKO TOLD ME SO MUCH
ABOUT YOU.

131
00:07:12,166 --> 00:07:15,500
YOU ARE EVEN MORE BEAUTIFUL
THAN I IMAGINED.

132
00:07:15,542 --> 00:07:19,834
- UH, ACTUALLY, THAT'S ASAMI.
THIS IS AVATAR KORRA.

133
00:07:19,875 --> 00:07:23,000
KORRA, THIS IS
MY GRANDMA, YIN.

134
00:07:23,041 --> 00:07:26,041
- YOU ARE VERY MUSCULAR
FOR A WOMAN.

135
00:07:26,083 --> 00:07:29,458
- UM, THANKS.
YOU TOO?

136
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:31,750
- WHAT LOVELY YOUNG WOMEN.

137
00:07:31,792 --> 00:07:36,792
MAKO, WHY AREN'T YOU DATING
ANY NICE GIRLS LIKE THEM?

138
00:07:36,834 --> 00:07:39,500
- UH, SO WHAT HAPPENED
TO YOU TWO?

139
00:07:39,542 --> 00:07:41,333
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?

140
00:07:41,375 --> 00:07:44,291
- WE WERE CAPTURED BY ZAHEER
AND TAKEN TO BA SING SE.

141
00:07:44,333 --> 00:07:46,291
WE WERE THERE WHEN
THE EARTH QUEEN WAS OVERTHROWN.

142
00:07:46,333 --> 00:07:48,500
- WHAT?
HOW DID YOU ESCAPE?

143
00:07:48,542 --> 00:07:49,542
- ZAHEER LET US GO.

144
00:07:49,583 --> 00:07:51,500
- WHY WOULD HE DO THAT?

145
00:07:51,542 --> 00:07:54,542
- BECAUSE HE WANTED US TO
FIND YOU AND DELIVER A MESSAGE.

146
00:07:54,583 --> 00:07:57,667
- ZAHEER IS HEADED TO THE
NORTHERN AIR TEMPLE AS WE SPEAK.

147
00:07:57,709 --> 00:07:59,709
HE SAID HE'S GONNA WIPE OUT
THE NEW AIR NATION

148
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:02,875
AND EVERYONE IN IT, UNLESS YOU
TURN YOURSELF OVER TO HIM.

149
00:08:09,458 --> 00:08:12,583
- ZAHEER'S THREATENING INNOCENT
LIVES, JUST TO GET TO ME.

150
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:14,041
- HE COULD BE BLUFFING.

151
00:08:14,083 --> 00:08:15,542
- HE'S ALREADY TAKEN OUT
THE EARTH QUEEN.

152
00:08:15,583 --> 00:08:17,291
I DON'T THINK HE BLUFFS.

153
00:08:17,333 --> 00:08:19,333
- WE NEED TO RADIO TENZIN
AND WARN HIM THAT

154
00:08:19,375 --> 00:08:20,834
THE RED LOTUS IS COMING.

155
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:22,542
- I AGREE.
UNFORTUNATELY,

156
00:08:22,583 --> 00:08:24,333
WE DON'T HAVE A RADIO
ON THE AIRSHIP.

157
00:08:24,375 --> 00:08:26,417
- THERE'S A PORTABLE RADIO
IN THE JEEP,

158
00:08:26,458 --> 00:08:29,208
BUT THE SIGNAL WILL NEVER MAKE
IT TO THE NORTHERN AIR TEMPLE.

159
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:32,166
- WE NEED TO GET TO A PLACE THAT
HAS A STRONG RADIO TRANSMITTER.

160
00:08:32,208 --> 00:08:34,166
THE METAL CLAN WILL HAVE ONE.

161
00:08:34,208 --> 00:08:36,750
- LET'S GO.
WE'LL RADIO SU ON THE WAY.

162
00:08:36,792 --> 00:08:38,917
HOPEFULLY SHE CAN GET AHOLD
OF TENZIN AT THE AIR TEMPLE

163
00:08:38,959 --> 00:08:40,834
BY THE TIME WE GET TO ZAOFU.

164
00:08:49,458 --> 00:08:51,583
DID YOU HAVE ANY LUCK
GETTING THROUGH TO TENZIN?

165
00:08:51,625 --> 00:08:54,458
- NO ONE'S ANSWERING. WHAT IF
ZAHEER IS ALREADY UP THERE?

166
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,792
I SHOULD NEVER HAVE
LET OPAL GO.

167
00:08:56,834 --> 00:08:59,542
- IT'S GOING TO BE OKAY, SU.

168
00:08:59,583 --> 00:09:01,417
- I HOPE SO.

169
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:04,834
[radio static]

170
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:09,834
- WE HAVE A STRONG SIGNAL,
BUT NO ONE'S ANSWERING.

171
00:09:09,875 --> 00:09:11,750
- I CAN'T JUST SIT AROUND HERE
WHILE A MADMAN

172
00:09:11,792 --> 00:09:13,291
IS ON HIS WAY
TO THE NORTHERN AIR TEMPLE.

173
00:09:13,333 --> 00:09:15,917
WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING.
- I'LL READY MY AIRSHIP.

174
00:09:15,959 --> 00:09:18,041
WITH THE FULL FORCE
OF THE METAL CLAN SECURITY

175
00:09:18,083 --> 00:09:21,500
BACKING US,
WE CAN TAKE THEM.

176
00:09:21,542 --> 00:09:24,250
- WE'LL NEVER MAKE IT UP THERE
BEFORE ZAHEER.

177
00:09:24,291 --> 00:09:25,625
- THERE MIGHT BE ANOTHER WAY
TO STOP HIM.

178
00:09:25,667 --> 00:09:27,291
IT'S A LONG SHOT,

179
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:29,583
BUT ZAHEER IS ALWAYS MEDITATING
INTO THE SPIRIT WORLD,

180
00:09:29,625 --> 00:09:32,667
AND I KNOW EXACTLY
WHERE HE GOES: XAI BAU'S GROVE.

181
00:09:32,709 --> 00:09:35,542
IF I COULD FIND HIM THERE,
MAYBE I COULD SOMEHOW TRAP HIM.

182
00:09:35,583 --> 00:09:38,125
- WE CAN'T PROTECT YOU IN THERE.
I DON'T LIKE IT.

183
00:09:38,166 --> 00:09:40,959
- I'LL BE FINE.
I HAVE TO TRY.

184
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,959
- I'LL WATCH OVER HER
AS SHE MEDITATES.

185
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,291
- I GUESS IN THE MEANTIME,
MAKO AND I WILL STAY HERE

186
00:09:45,333 --> 00:09:46,750
AND TRY TO GET THROUGH
TO THE TEMPLE.

187
00:09:46,792 --> 00:09:49,667
- WE'LL HELP SU
READY THE AIRSHIP.

188
00:09:51,208 --> 00:09:54,917
- I'M GOING TO TAKE A NAP.

189
00:10:03,709 --> 00:10:07,041
- ZAHEER, COME OUT!
FACE ME!

190
00:10:07,083 --> 00:10:10,125
LEAVE THE AIRBENDERS
OUT OF THIS.

191
00:10:15,625 --> 00:10:18,000
THERE YOU ARE.

192
00:10:18,041 --> 00:10:20,375
- PLEASE DON'T HURT ME, KORRA.

193
00:10:20,417 --> 00:10:22,083
I'M JUST AN OLD MAN.

194
00:10:22,125 --> 00:10:24,917
- IROH?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

195
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:27,583
- I WAS JUST OUT SEARCHING
FOR A NEW TEAPOT

196
00:10:27,625 --> 00:10:32,166
TO ADD TO MY COLLECTION,
BUT INSTEAD I FOUND YOU.

197
00:10:32,208 --> 00:10:34,125
[laughs]

198
00:10:34,166 --> 00:10:37,542
IN THE SPIRIT WORLD, YOU ALWAYS
SEEM TO FIND SOMETHING

199
00:10:37,583 --> 00:10:41,375
YOU DIDN'T KNOW
YOU WERE LOOKING FOR.

200
00:10:41,417 --> 00:10:43,709
YOU LOOK TROUBLED.

201
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:46,041
- I AM.
- SIT.

202
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:50,125
WHAT IS ON YOUR MIND?

203
00:10:50,166 --> 00:10:51,959
- THERE'S A MANIAC ON THE LOOSE,

204
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,333
AND HE'S THREATENING TO DESTROY
THE NEW AIR NATION.

205
00:10:54,375 --> 00:10:55,959
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.

206
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,667
- JUST BECAUSE YOU ARE
THE AVATAR

207
00:10:58,709 --> 00:11:01,542
DOESN'T MEAN YOU WILL HAVE
ALL THE ANSWERS.

208
00:11:01,583 --> 00:11:03,834
- I KNOW MANY AVATARS
HAVE NEEDED GUIDANCE,

209
00:11:03,875 --> 00:11:06,041
BUT I'M THE ONLY ONE
SINCE AVATAR WAN

210
00:11:06,083 --> 00:11:08,625
THAT CAN'T GET HELP
FROM MY PAST LIVES.

211
00:11:08,667 --> 00:11:10,291
I WISH I COULD TALK TO AANG.

212
00:11:10,333 --> 00:11:14,125
- YOU KNOW, ZUKO AND AANG
WERE CLOSE FRIENDS.

213
00:11:14,166 --> 00:11:16,000
- LORD ZUKO, OF COURSE.

214
00:11:16,041 --> 00:11:18,333
- YES, MY NEPHEW.

215
00:11:18,375 --> 00:11:22,917
THEIR RELATIONSHIP STARTED OFF
A LITTLE ROCKY,

216
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:26,083
BUT THEY GREW
TO BECOME LIFELONG FRIENDS.

217
00:11:26,125 --> 00:11:28,041
BEST FRIENDS.

218
00:11:28,083 --> 00:11:31,667
- THANK YOU.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

219
00:11:31,709 --> 00:11:33,834
YOU'RE RIGHT
ABOUT THE SPIRIT WORLD.

220
00:11:33,875 --> 00:11:35,625
I CAME HERE LOOKING
FOR SOMEONE ELSE,

221
00:11:35,667 --> 00:11:39,417
BUT I'M GLAD I FOUND YOU.

222
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:45,250
- DID YOU FIND ZAHEER?
- NO, HE WASN'T THERE.

223
00:11:45,291 --> 00:11:47,417
BUT THERE'S SOMEONE
I NEED TO TALK TO.

224
00:11:50,166 --> 00:11:53,458
YOU'RE LEAVING?
AREN'T YOU COMING
TO THE AIR TEMPLE WITH US?

225
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,333
- I'M SORRY, BUT I CAN'T.

226
00:11:55,375 --> 00:11:57,750
I'M GOING BACK
TO THE FIRE NATION.

227
00:11:57,792 --> 00:12:00,166
IF IT'S TRUE THAT THE RED LOTUS
IS TARGETING

228
00:12:00,208 --> 00:12:03,667
THE NATION'S LEADERS,
I NEED TO PROTECT MY DAUGHTER.

229
00:12:03,709 --> 00:12:06,583
- I UNDERSTAND, YOU HAVE TO KEEP
THE FIRE LORD SAFE.

230
00:12:06,625 --> 00:12:08,375
BUT BEFORE YOU LEAVE,

231
00:12:08,417 --> 00:12:10,291
I WAS WONDERING IF YOU COULD
HELP ME WITH SOMETHING.

232
00:12:10,333 --> 00:12:13,667
- I WAS OFTEN AANG'S COUNCIL,
AND I'D LOVE TO BE YOURS.

233
00:12:13,709 --> 00:12:16,792
- THAT'S JUST IT, YOU KNEW AANG
BETTER THAN ANYONE.

234
00:12:16,834 --> 00:12:18,333
I WAS WONDERING IF YOU KNEW
WHAT HE MIGHT DO

235
00:12:18,375 --> 00:12:20,250
IF HE WERE IN MY SITUATION.

236
00:12:20,291 --> 00:12:25,291
- HMM, REBUILDING THE AIR NATION
WAS AANG'S BIGGEST DREAM.

237
00:12:25,333 --> 00:12:28,792
HE WOULD BE BESIDE HIMSELF
WITH JOY WITH WHAT YOU'VE DONE,

238
00:12:28,834 --> 00:12:31,041
AND IF HE ACCOMPLISHED
THAT GOAL,

239
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:35,083
HE MIGHT HAVE SACRIFICED
ANYTHING TO PROTECT IT.

240
00:12:35,125 --> 00:12:37,542
- SO HE WOULD GIVE HIMSELF UP
TO SAVE THE AIR NATION?

241
00:12:37,583 --> 00:12:39,709
- I DON'T KNOW FOR SURE.

242
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:42,625
THE AIRBENDERS MIGHT HAVE BEEN
CLOSEST TO AANG'S HEART,

243
00:12:42,667 --> 00:12:45,166
BUT AS THE AVATAR,
HE WAS CONCERNED

244
00:12:45,208 --> 00:12:47,166
WITH PEOPLE OF ALL NATIONS.

245
00:12:47,208 --> 00:12:50,834
NO ONE KNEW BETTER THAN AANG
THAT IN TIMES OF TURMOIL

246
00:12:50,875 --> 00:12:54,083
THE WORLD NEEDS ITS AVATAR
THE MOST.

247
00:12:54,125 --> 00:12:56,625
- THANKS.
YOUR UNCLE WAS RIGHT.

248
00:12:56,667 --> 00:12:58,417
IT WAS HELPFUL TALKING TO YOU.

249
00:12:58,458 --> 00:13:01,583
- WAIT, YOU SPOKE
WITH MY UNCLE?

250
00:13:01,625 --> 00:13:04,166
- YES, IN THE SPIRIT WORLD.

251
00:13:04,208 --> 00:13:05,542
A COUPLE OF TIMES ACTUALLY.

252
00:13:05,583 --> 00:13:07,417
[footsteps approaching]

253
00:13:07,458 --> 00:13:09,583
- GUYS, WE GOT THROUGH
TO THE AIR TEMPLE.

254
00:13:11,208 --> 00:13:12,417
- WHO IS THIS?

255
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:15,333
- I TOLD YOU,
IT'S BOLIN!

256
00:13:15,375 --> 00:13:18,375
- BOLIN'S NOT HERE RIGHT NOW,
CAN I TAKE A MESSAGE?

257
00:13:18,417 --> 00:13:21,959
- NO, I'M NOT LOOKING FOR BOLIN,
I AM BOLIN!

258
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,333
AHH, LOOK, I NEED YOU
TO FIND YOUR DAD.

259
00:13:24,375 --> 00:13:26,125
- HE'S OUTSIDE WITH THE BISON.

260
00:13:26,166 --> 00:13:29,500
DID YOU KNOW WE FOUND
A WHOLE HERD FULL OF BABY BISON?

261
00:13:29,542 --> 00:13:32,166
- NO.
A WHOLE HERD, REALLY?

262
00:13:32,208 --> 00:13:33,750
[grunts]

263
00:13:33,792 --> 00:13:35,458
- MEELO,
THIS IS YOUR COMMANDING OFFICER.

264
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:36,834
GO GET YOUR DAD, NOW.

265
00:13:36,875 --> 00:13:38,750
- YES, SIR.

266
00:13:40,625 --> 00:13:43,500
- COME ON.
COME ON.

267
00:13:43,542 --> 00:13:45,166
- HELLO, THIS IS TENZIN.

268
00:13:45,208 --> 00:13:46,625
- TENZIN, LISTEN TO ME
CAREFULLY.

269
00:13:46,667 --> 00:13:48,333
ZAHEER IS ON HIS WAY
TO THE TEMPLE.

270
00:13:48,375 --> 00:13:50,000
HE'S COMING
FOR THE AIRBENDERS.

271
00:13:50,041 --> 00:13:52,041
YOU HAVE TO GET EVERYONE
OUT OF THERE IMMEDIATELY.

272
00:13:52,083 --> 00:13:54,583
DROP EVERYTHING.
LEAVE NOW!

273
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:58,166
- OH, NO.
- WHAT? WHAT IS IT?

274
00:13:58,208 --> 00:14:00,834
TENZIN!
TENZIN, WHAT'S HAPPENING?

275
00:14:00,875 --> 00:14:03,834
- IT'S TOO LATE.

276
00:14:03,875 --> 00:14:06,500
HE'S HERE.

277
00:14:17,375 --> 00:14:18,792
- WHAT IS IT, DADDY?

278
00:14:18,834 --> 00:14:20,542
- WE NEED TO GET EVERYONE
OUT OF HERE.

279
00:14:20,583 --> 00:14:22,667
STAY CLOSE TO ME.

280
00:14:32,667 --> 00:14:34,000
- WHAT'S GOING ON, TENZIN?

281
00:14:34,041 --> 00:14:36,208
- IT'S ZAHEER.
ROUND EVERYONE UP.

282
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:39,208
WE NEED TO GET TO THE BISON
AND EVACUATE IMMEDIATELY.

283
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,792
- GUYS, WE GOT AN EMERGENCY.

284
00:14:45,834 --> 00:14:49,583
WE'RE EVACUATING THE TEMPLE.
COME ON.

285
00:14:49,625 --> 00:14:51,834
LOOK OUT!

[door opens]

287
00:15:00,792 --> 00:15:02,750

WE HAVE TO LEAVE.

- [screams]

289
00:15:07,375 --> 00:15:10,458
- NO ONE'S GOING ANYWHERE,
OR SHE GETS IT.

290
00:15:16,083 --> 00:15:18,750
- GOOD, THE ENTIRE FAMILY
IS HERE.

291
00:15:28,417 --> 00:15:31,417
IT'S A PLEASURE TO FINALLY MEET
A TRUE AIRBENDING MASTER.

292
00:15:31,458 --> 00:15:33,000
- WHAT IS IT
YOU WANT FROM US?

293
00:15:33,041 --> 00:15:34,250
- NOTHING AT ALL.

294
00:15:34,291 --> 00:15:37,333
IN FACT,
IF EVERYONE COOPERATES,

295
00:15:37,375 --> 00:15:39,917
YOU WILL ALL WALK OUT
OF THIS SITUATION UNHARMED.

296
00:15:39,959 --> 00:15:41,333
- THEN WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

297
00:15:41,375 --> 00:15:44,542
- I WANT KORRA,
AND I'M TIRED OF CHASING HER.

298
00:15:44,583 --> 00:15:47,458
- YOU'RE USING US AS LEVERAGE?
- YES.

299
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:49,333
- I WILL NEVER LET YOU
GET TO KORRA.

300
00:15:49,375 --> 00:15:52,750
- UNFORTUNATELY,
YOU DON'T HAVE A CHOICE.

301
00:15:52,792 --> 00:15:54,625
- YES, I DO.

302

[all grunt]

303
00:15:57,625 --> 00:15:59,166
JINORA, GET EVERYONE
OUT OF HERE.

304
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:03,458
BUMI, KYA,
HELP ME HOLD THEM OFF.

305
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,750

AS MUCH FUN AS I AM.
