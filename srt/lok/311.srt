1
00:00:08,034 --> 00:00:09,402
- EARTH.

2
00:00:09,402 --> 00:00:11,137
FIRE.

3
00:00:11,137 --> 00:00:12,906
AIR.

4
00:00:12,906 --> 00:00:15,075
WATER.

5
00:00:15,075 --> 00:00:19,145
ONLY THE AVATAR CAN MASTER
ALL FOUR ELEMENTS

6
00:00:19,145 --> 00:00:22,082
AND BRING BALANCE
TO THE WORLD.

7
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:28,588
- BA SING SE HAS FALLEN!

8
00:00:28,588 --> 00:00:30,824
AFTER ZAHEER AND THE RED LOTUS
TOPPLED THE EARTH QUEEN,

9
00:00:30,824 --> 00:00:32,726
THE CITY DESCENDED INTO CHAOS.

10
00:00:32,726 --> 00:00:35,428
MEANWHILE, KORRA AND ASAMI
TRIED TO ESCAPE THEIR CAPTORS

11
00:00:35,428 --> 00:00:36,963
BUT CRASHED IN THE DESERT.

12
00:00:36,963 --> 00:00:38,231
AFTER GETTING TO SAFETY,
THEY MET UP

13
00:00:38,231 --> 00:00:39,966
WITH LORD ZUKO, TONRAQ,
AND BEIFONG.

14
00:00:39,966 --> 00:00:42,903
BACK IN BA SING SE,
ZAHEER FREED MAKO AND BOLIN,

15
00:00:42,903 --> 00:00:45,305
GIVING THEM A VITAL MESSAGE
TO DELIVER TO KORRA.

16
00:00:45,305 --> 00:00:46,940
BUT WILL THE BROTHERS
FIND HER IN TIME?

17
00:00:59,119 --> 00:01:02,289
- I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.
THE UPPER RING IS IN CHAOS.

18
00:01:02,289 --> 00:01:05,125
- DON'T TRY TO STOP US.
WE'RE TAKING BACK WHAT'S OURS.

19
00:01:05,125 --> 00:01:07,294
- STOP YOU?
I'M GONNA JOIN YOU.

20
00:01:07,294 --> 00:01:10,964
I KNOW WHERE THE GOOD STUFF IS.

21
00:01:10,964 --> 00:01:13,533
- SHOULD WE DO SOMETHING?
- THIS ISN'T OUR BATTLE.

22
00:01:13,533 --> 00:01:16,269
WE HAVE TO DELIVER ZAHEER'S
MESSAGE TO KORRA IMMEDIATELY.

23
00:01:16,269 --> 00:01:19,072
- RIGHT. OKAY.
FIND KORRA, DELIVER MESSAGE.

24
00:01:19,072 --> 00:01:20,207
YEAH, THIS SHOULD BE EASY.

25
00:01:20,207 --> 00:01:21,708
WE JUST GOTTA GET
OUT OF THE CITY

26
00:01:21,708 --> 00:01:23,443
AND GET TO THE DESERT,
THEN SOMEHOW FIND HER

27
00:01:23,443 --> 00:01:25,979
IN THE VAST, EXPANSIVE WASTELAND
THAT GOES ON FOR THOUSANDS

28
00:01:25,979 --> 00:01:28,148
AND THOUSANDS OF MILES.

29
00:01:28,148 --> 00:01:31,985
[sighs]
THIS ISN'T GONNA BE EASY.

30
00:01:31,985 --> 00:01:34,421
- WE NEED AN AIRSHIP.

31
00:01:39,192 --> 00:01:40,961
- OOH!

32
00:01:40,961 --> 00:01:43,964
- EXCUSE ME, MAY I HAVE
YOUR ATTENTION PLEASE?

33
00:01:43,964 --> 00:01:45,899
I'M WITH
THE REPUBLIC CITY POLICE,

34
00:01:45,899 --> 00:01:48,835
AND I NEED TO COMMANDEER
THIS AIRSHIP TO HELP THE AVATAR.

35
00:01:53,306 --> 00:01:55,175
- LET ME GIVE IT A SHOT.

36
00:01:55,175 --> 00:01:57,544
HEY, THE QUEEN'S GOLD IS ON
THE THIRD FLOOR OF THE PALACE!

37
00:01:57,544 --> 00:02:01,681
SECOND DOOR ON THE RIGHT!

38
00:02:01,681 --> 00:02:05,685
YOU JUST GOTTA KNOW
HOW TO TALK TO THEM, BRO.

39
00:02:05,685 --> 00:02:07,354
- THEY TOOK EVERYTHING.

40
00:02:07,354 --> 00:02:09,556
I MEAN, WHO RIPS OUT
A TRANSMISSION RADIO?

41
00:02:09,556 --> 00:02:11,525
- SOME FOLKS JUST
DO NOT HAVE RESPECT

42
00:02:11,525 --> 00:02:13,360
FOR OTHER PEOPLE'S PROPERTY.

43
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,762
NOW LET'S STEAL THIS AIRSHIP!

44
00:02:15,762 --> 00:02:17,264
- YOU KNOW HOW
TO FLY THIS THING?

45
00:02:17,264 --> 00:02:19,566
- TECHNICALLY SPEAKING?
NO.

46
00:02:19,566 --> 00:02:23,170
BUT, COME ON,
HOW HARD CAN IT BE?

47
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:24,871
[all scream]

48
00:02:24,871 --> 00:02:26,706
- UP! UP!

49
00:02:26,706 --> 00:02:29,276
- I DON'T SEE ANY "UP" BUTTON.
I SEE LEVERS AND SWITCHES.

50
00:02:29,276 --> 00:02:31,611
OH, THERE IT IS.

51
00:02:38,952 --> 00:02:41,221
- THE WHOLE CITY
IS FALLING TO PIECES.

52
00:02:41,221 --> 00:02:43,089
- MAKO, OUR FAMILY'S DOWN THERE.

53
00:02:43,089 --> 00:02:44,724
- MOVE OVER.
- AHH!

54
00:02:44,724 --> 00:02:46,193
- WE'RE GETTING THEM OUT.

55
00:02:46,193 --> 00:02:48,595
- OH, YOU THINK
JUST BECAUSE YOU DATED ASAMI,

56
00:02:48,595 --> 00:02:50,363
YOU KNOW HOW TO FLY THIS
BETTER THAN ME?

57
00:02:50,363 --> 00:02:52,732
- YEAH.

58
00:03:01,374 --> 00:03:03,777
- BOLIN?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

59
00:03:03,777 --> 00:03:05,212
- I CAME TO GET YOU GUYS OUT.

60
00:03:05,212 --> 00:03:07,214
THIS WHOLE BLOCK
IS ABOUT TO GO UP IN FLAMES.

61
00:03:07,214 --> 00:03:09,649
COME ON, MAKO AND I
HAVE AN AIRSHIP ON THE ROOF.

62
00:03:09,649 --> 00:03:12,052
- WE CAN'T.
GRANDMA WON'T GO.

63
00:03:12,052 --> 00:03:17,090
- THIS PLACE IS MY WHOLE WORLD.
I WILL NOT LEAVE.

64
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:21,661
OH, BUT I'M SO GLAD MY LITTLE
BOLIN HAS COME BACK TO VISIT.

65
00:03:21,661 --> 00:03:24,064
SIT DOWN.
WOULD YOU LIKE SOME TEA?

66
00:03:24,064 --> 00:03:25,966
- GRANDMA, WE DON'T HAVE TIME
FOR TEA.

67
00:03:25,966 --> 00:03:28,235
- MOM, PLEASE.
- NO!

68
00:03:28,235 --> 00:03:31,605
I CAN'T ABANDON THE PLACE
WHERE I RAISED MY FAMILY.

69
00:03:31,605 --> 00:03:33,473
IT'S MY HOME.

70
00:03:33,473 --> 00:03:35,575
- GRANDMA, THERE'S ONE THING
THAT MAKO AND I HAVE LEARNED

71
00:03:35,575 --> 00:03:37,978
FROM ALL OUR YEARS
ON THE STREET:

72
00:03:37,978 --> 00:03:39,846
IT DOESN'T MATTER
WHERE YOU GO.

73
00:03:39,846 --> 00:03:42,782
IF YOU HAVE YOUR FAMILY
WITH YOU,

74
00:03:42,782 --> 00:03:45,519
YOU'LL ALWAYS BE AT HOME.

75
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:47,254
- I'M NOT GOING.

76
00:03:47,254 --> 00:03:49,322
- FINE!
YOU LEAVE ME NO CHOICE.

77
00:03:49,322 --> 00:03:51,191
WE'RE ROLLING OUT!

78
00:03:51,191 --> 00:03:53,927
- [gasps] WAIT.

79
00:03:53,927 --> 00:03:56,296
OKAY, LET'S GO.

80
00:04:12,045 --> 00:04:14,281
- THANKS FOR GETTING US
OUT OF THERE.

81
00:04:14,281 --> 00:04:16,283
I MEAN, I PROBABLY COULD HAVE
HANDLED IT MYSELF

82
00:04:16,283 --> 00:04:21,087
IF YOU GUYS DIDN'T SHOW UP,
BUT THANKS.

83
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:27,194
- [kisses]
MAY SHE REST IN PEACE.

84
00:04:27,194 --> 00:04:30,330
THIS AIRSHIP IS NICE.
IS IT OUR NEW HOME?

85
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:33,066
- NO, GRANDMA, I'M NOT SURE
WHERE WE'RE GONNA TAKE YOU.

86
00:04:33,066 --> 00:04:35,235
BUT RIGHT NOW,
WE NEED TO FIND KORRA.

87
00:04:35,235 --> 00:04:36,870
- DID SOMETHING HAPPEN
TO THE AVATAR?

88
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:38,338
- I'M AFRAID SO.

89
00:04:38,338 --> 00:04:40,574
HER AIRSHIP WENT DOWN
SOMEWHERE IN THE DESERT.

90
00:04:40,574 --> 00:04:43,410
SHE WAS COMING FROM A MILITARY
BASE NEAR THE MISTY PALMS OASIS

91
00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:45,679
AND HEADING TO BA SING SE.

92
00:04:45,679 --> 00:04:47,681
IF WE RETRACE HER ROUTE
BACK TO THE BASE,

93
00:04:47,681 --> 00:04:49,616
WE SHOULD FIND THE WRECKAGE.

94
00:05:11,438 --> 00:05:13,773
- [snores]

95
00:05:13,773 --> 00:05:17,210
- GUYS, IT'S THE WRECKAGE.
I FOUND IT.

96
00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:19,246
THERE.

97
00:05:19,246 --> 00:05:21,748
- THAT'S A BA SING SE AIRSHIP,
ALL RIGHT.

98
00:05:21,748 --> 00:05:23,383
BUT WHERE'S THE REST OF IT?

99
00:05:23,383 --> 00:05:26,853
- I DON'T KNOW,
BUT THERE ARE SOME TRACKS.

100
00:05:38,298 --> 00:05:41,234
SEE? I TOLD YOU.
LANDING IS HARD.

101
00:05:49,643 --> 00:05:51,611
- [gasps] SPIRITS.

102
00:05:51,611 --> 00:05:54,381
- OKAY, GUYS, WE THINK KORRA
FOUND HER WAY BACK HERE.

103
00:05:54,381 --> 00:05:56,917
NOW LET'S SPLIT OFF INTO TEAMS
AND SCOUR THE TOWN.

104
00:05:56,917 --> 00:05:58,752
YES, WE'LL NEED YOUR HELP TOO,
PABU.

105
00:05:58,752 --> 00:06:00,921
NOW JUST GIVE ME A SECOND
WHILE I--[gasps]

106
00:06:00,921 --> 00:06:03,657
WAIT.
PABU?

107
00:06:03,657 --> 00:06:06,459
PABU!
[laughs]

108
00:06:06,459 --> 00:06:10,163
- WHY IS BOLIN HUGGING
THAT BIG RAT?

109
00:06:10,163 --> 00:06:13,300
EW.
NOW HE'S KISSING IT.

110
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:15,468
- MWAH, MWAH, MWAH, MWAH.

111
00:06:15,468 --> 00:06:17,437
I'M NEVER GONNA
LET YOU GO AGAIN.

112
00:06:17,437 --> 00:06:19,339
- GUYS, LOOK OUT!
GIANT DOG-BEAST THINGY!

113
00:06:19,339 --> 00:06:22,509
[all shout]

114
00:06:22,509 --> 00:06:25,645
- OKAY, ALL RIGHT, NAGA.
IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU TOO.

115
00:06:25,645 --> 00:06:28,648
AHH, STOP.
YOU'RE LICKING MY MOUTH.

116
00:06:28,648 --> 00:06:30,350
[spits]

117
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:32,052
- ASAMI!
KORRA!

118
00:06:32,052 --> 00:06:34,588
- YOU GUYS ARE OKAY!

119
00:06:37,591 --> 00:06:40,927
SORRY, I WAS JUST--
IT'S SO GOOD TO SEE YOU.

120
00:06:40,927 --> 00:06:43,630
- IT'S REALLY GOOD TO SEE
YOU TOO, BOTH OF YOU.

121
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:45,932
- GOOD.
YOU GUYS AREN'T DEAD.

122
00:06:45,932 --> 00:06:48,301
- DON'T GET ALL MUSHY ON ME,
CHIEF.

123
00:06:48,301 --> 00:06:51,505
TONRAQ, SIR.

124
00:06:51,505 --> 00:06:54,808
- OH, MY GOSH.
IT'S LORD ZUKO.

125
00:06:54,808 --> 00:06:58,778
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.
[whimpers]

126
00:06:58,778 --> 00:07:00,881
- UH, FORGIVE MY BROTHER.

127
00:07:00,881 --> 00:07:03,350
WE'RE JUST REALLY HONORED
TO MEET YOU, SIR.

128
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:07,020
- IT'S A PLEASURE TO MEET YOU
AS WELL.

129
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:09,356
- YOU MUST BE THE AVATAR.

130
00:07:09,356 --> 00:07:12,058
MAKO TOLD ME SO MUCH
ABOUT YOU.

131
00:07:12,058 --> 00:07:15,161
YOU ARE EVEN MORE BEAUTIFUL
THAN I IMAGINED.

132
00:07:15,161 --> 00:07:19,633
- UH, ACTUALLY, THAT'S ASAMI.
THIS IS AVATAR KORRA.

133
00:07:19,633 --> 00:07:22,736
KORRA, THIS IS
MY GRANDMA, YIN.

134
00:07:22,736 --> 00:07:26,039
- YOU ARE VERY MUSCULAR
FOR A WOMAN.

135
00:07:26,039 --> 00:07:29,309
- UM, THANKS.
YOU TOO?

136
00:07:29,309 --> 00:07:31,545
- WHAT LOVELY YOUNG WOMEN.

137
00:07:31,545 --> 00:07:36,583
MAKO, WHY AREN'T YOU DATING
ANY NICE GIRLS LIKE THEM?

138
00:07:36,583 --> 00:07:39,352
- UH, SO WHAT HAPPENED
TO YOU TWO?

139
00:07:39,352 --> 00:07:41,054
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?

140
00:07:41,054 --> 00:07:44,191
- WE WERE CAPTURED BY ZAHEER
AND TAKEN TO BA SING SE.

141
00:07:44,191 --> 00:07:46,193
WE WERE THERE WHEN
THE EARTH QUEEN WAS OVERTHROWN.

142
00:07:46,193 --> 00:07:48,361
- WHAT?
HOW DID YOU ESCAPE?

143
00:07:48,361 --> 00:07:49,596
- ZAHEER LET US GO.

144
00:07:49,596 --> 00:07:51,364
- WHY WOULD HE DO THAT?

145
00:07:51,364 --> 00:07:54,201
- BECAUSE HE WANTED US TO
FIND YOU AND DELIVER A MESSAGE.

146
00:07:54,201 --> 00:07:57,504
- ZAHEER IS HEADED TO THE
NORTHERN AIR TEMPLE AS WE SPEAK.

147
00:07:57,504 --> 00:07:59,539
HE SAID HE'S GONNA WIPE OUT
THE NEW AIR NATION

148
00:07:59,539 --> 00:08:02,776
AND EVERYONE IN IT, UNLESS YOU
TURN YOURSELF OVER TO HIM.

149
00:08:08,711 --> 00:08:12,048
- ZAHEER'S THREATENING INNOCENT
LIVES, JUST TO GET TO ME.

150
00:08:12,048 --> 00:08:13,416
- HE COULD BE BLUFFING.

151
00:08:13,416 --> 00:08:15,017
- HE'S ALREADY TAKEN OUT
THE EARTH QUEEN.

152
00:08:15,017 --> 00:08:16,819
I DON'T THINK HE BLUFFS.

153
00:08:16,819 --> 00:08:18,855
- WE NEED TO RADIO TENZIN
AND WARN HIM THAT

154
00:08:18,855 --> 00:08:20,256
THE RED LOTUS IS COMING.

155
00:08:20,256 --> 00:08:22,024
- I AGREE.
UNFORTUNATELY,

156
00:08:22,024 --> 00:08:23,860
WE DON'T HAVE A RADIO
ON THE AIRSHIP.

157
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:25,728
- THERE'S A PORTABLE RADIO
IN THE JEEP,

158
00:08:25,728 --> 00:08:28,564
BUT THE SIGNAL WILL NEVER MAKE
IT TO THE NORTHERN AIR TEMPLE.

159
00:08:28,564 --> 00:08:31,734
- WE NEED TO GET TO A PLACE THAT
HAS A STRONG RADIO TRANSMITTER.

160
00:08:31,734 --> 00:08:33,536
THE METAL CLAN WILL HAVE ONE.

161
00:08:33,536 --> 00:08:36,205
- LET'S GO.
WE'LL RADIO SU ON THE WAY.

162
00:08:36,205 --> 00:08:38,541
HOPEFULLY SHE CAN GET AHOLD
OF TENZIN AT THE AIR TEMPLE

163
00:08:38,541 --> 00:08:40,643
BY THE TIME WE GET TO ZAOFU.

164
00:08:48,918 --> 00:08:50,853
DID YOU HAVE ANY LUCK
GETTING THROUGH TO TENZIN?

165
00:08:50,853 --> 00:08:53,956
- NO ONE'S ANSWERING. WHAT IF
ZAHEER IS ALREADY UP THERE?

166
00:08:53,956 --> 00:08:56,225
I SHOULD NEVER HAVE
LET OPAL GO.

167
00:08:56,225 --> 00:08:59,028
- IT'S GOING TO BE OKAY, SU.

168
00:08:59,028 --> 00:09:01,064
- I HOPE SO.

169
00:09:01,064 --> 00:09:04,367
[radio static]

170
00:09:06,702 --> 00:09:09,205
- WE HAVE A STRONG SIGNAL,
BUT NO ONE'S ANSWERING.

171
00:09:09,205 --> 00:09:11,140
- I CAN'T JUST SIT AROUND HERE
WHILE A MADMAN

172
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:12,775
IS ON HIS WAY
TO THE NORTHERN AIR TEMPLE.

173
00:09:12,775 --> 00:09:15,278
WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING.
- I'LL READY MY AIRSHIP.

174
00:09:15,278 --> 00:09:17,580
WITH THE FULL FORCE
OF THE METAL CLAN SECURITY

175
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:20,750
BACKING US,
WE CAN TAKE THEM.

176
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:23,786
- WE'LL NEVER MAKE IT UP THERE
BEFORE ZAHEER.

177
00:09:23,786 --> 00:09:24,954
- THERE MIGHT BE ANOTHER WAY
TO STOP HIM.

178
00:09:24,954 --> 00:09:26,556
IT'S A LONG SHOT,

179
00:09:26,556 --> 00:09:28,991
BUT ZAHEER IS ALWAYS MEDITATING
INTO THE SPIRIT WORLD,

180
00:09:28,991 --> 00:09:32,061
AND I KNOW EXACTLY
WHERE HE GOES: XAI BAU'S GROVE.

181
00:09:32,061 --> 00:09:34,964
IF I COULD FIND HIM THERE,
MAYBE I COULD SOMEHOW TRAP HIM.

182
00:09:34,964 --> 00:09:37,633
- WE CAN'T PROTECT YOU IN THERE.
I DON'T LIKE IT.

183
00:09:37,633 --> 00:09:40,303
- I'LL BE FINE.
I HAVE TO TRY.

184
00:09:40,303 --> 00:09:42,305
- I'LL WATCH OVER HER
AS SHE MEDITATES.

185
00:09:42,305 --> 00:09:44,574
- I GUESS IN THE MEANTIME,
MAKO AND I WILL STAY HERE

186
00:09:44,574 --> 00:09:46,142
AND TRY TO GET THROUGH
TO THE TEMPLE.

187
00:09:46,142 --> 00:09:49,245
- WE'LL HELP SU
READY THE AIRSHIP.

188
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:54,450
- I'M GOING TO TAKE A NAP.

189
00:10:03,092 --> 00:10:06,362
- ZAHEER, COME OUT!
FACE ME!

190
00:10:06,362 --> 00:10:09,799
LEAVE THE AIRBENDERS
OUT OF THIS.

191
00:10:15,204 --> 00:10:17,340
THERE YOU ARE.

192
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:19,842
- PLEASE DON'T HURT ME, KORRA.

193
00:10:19,842 --> 00:10:21,611
I'M JUST AN OLD MAN.

194
00:10:21,611 --> 00:10:24,280
- IROH?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

195
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:27,016
- I WAS JUST OUT SEARCHING
FOR A NEW TEAPOT

196
00:10:27,016 --> 00:10:31,687
TO ADD TO MY COLLECTION,
BUT INSTEAD I FOUND YOU.

197
00:10:31,687 --> 00:10:33,456
[laughs]

198
00:10:33,456 --> 00:10:36,993
IN THE SPIRIT WORLD, YOU ALWAYS
SEEM TO FIND SOMETHING

199
00:10:36,993 --> 00:10:40,863
YOU DIDN'T KNOW
YOU WERE LOOKING FOR.

200
00:10:40,863 --> 00:10:43,132
YOU LOOK TROUBLED.

201
00:10:43,132 --> 00:10:45,568
- I AM.
- SIT.

202
00:10:47,703 --> 00:10:49,639
WHAT IS ON YOUR MIND?

203
00:10:49,639 --> 00:10:51,307
- THERE'S A MANIAC ON THE LOOSE,

204
00:10:51,307 --> 00:10:53,810
AND HE'S THREATENING TO DESTROY
THE NEW AIR NATION.

205
00:10:53,810 --> 00:10:55,311
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.

206
00:10:55,311 --> 00:10:58,081
- JUST BECAUSE YOU ARE
THE AVATAR

207
00:10:58,081 --> 00:11:00,983
DOESN'T MEAN YOU WILL HAVE
ALL THE ANSWERS.

208
00:11:00,983 --> 00:11:03,152
- I KNOW MANY AVATARS
HAVE NEEDED GUIDANCE,

209
00:11:03,152 --> 00:11:05,321
BUT I'M THE ONLY ONE
SINCE AVATAR WAN

210
00:11:05,321 --> 00:11:07,990
THAT CAN'T GET HELP
FROM MY PAST LIVES.

211
00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:09,525
I WISH I COULD TALK TO AANG.

212
00:11:09,525 --> 00:11:13,596
- YOU KNOW, ZUKO AND AANG
WERE CLOSE FRIENDS.

213
00:11:13,596 --> 00:11:16,199
- LORD ZUKO, OF COURSE.

214
00:11:16,199 --> 00:11:18,267
- YES, MY NEPHEW.

215
00:11:18,267 --> 00:11:22,939
THEIR RELATIONSHIP STARTED OFF
A LITTLE ROCKY,

216
00:11:22,939 --> 00:11:26,275
BUT THEY GREW
TO BECOME LIFELONG FRIENDS.

217
00:11:26,275 --> 00:11:28,010
BEST FRIENDS.

218
00:11:28,010 --> 00:11:31,714
- THANK YOU.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

219
00:11:31,714 --> 00:11:33,850
YOU'RE RIGHT
ABOUT THE SPIRIT WORLD.

220
00:11:33,850 --> 00:11:35,685
I CAME HERE LOOKING
FOR SOMEONE ELSE,

221
00:11:35,685 --> 00:11:39,689
BUT I'M GLAD I FOUND YOU.

222
00:11:42,358 --> 00:11:45,194
- DID YOU FIND ZAHEER?
- NO, HE WASN'T THERE.

223
00:11:45,194 --> 00:11:47,697
BUT THERE'S SOMEONE
I NEED TO TALK TO.

224
00:11:49,465 --> 00:11:51,067
YOU'RE LEAVING?

225
00:11:51,067 --> 00:11:53,569
AREN'T YOU COMING
TO THE AIR TEMPLE WITH US?

226
00:11:53,569 --> 00:11:55,271
- I'M SORRY, BUT I CAN'T.

227
00:11:55,271 --> 00:11:57,607
I'M GOING BACK
TO THE FIRE NATION.

228
00:11:57,607 --> 00:12:00,076
IF IT'S TRUE THAT THE RED LOTUS
IS TARGETING

229
00:12:00,076 --> 00:12:03,479
THE NATION'S LEADERS,
I NEED TO PROTECT MY DAUGHTER.

230
00:12:03,479 --> 00:12:06,616
- I UNDERSTAND, YOU HAVE TO KEEP
THE FIRE LORD SAFE.

231
00:12:06,616 --> 00:12:08,217
BUT BEFORE YOU LEAVE,

232
00:12:08,217 --> 00:12:10,153
I WAS WONDERING IF YOU COULD
HELP ME WITH SOMETHING.

233
00:12:10,153 --> 00:12:13,456
- I WAS OFTEN AANG'S COUNCIL,
AND I'D LOVE TO BE YOURS.

234
00:12:13,456 --> 00:12:16,626
- THAT'S JUST IT, YOU KNEW AANG
BETTER THAN ANYONE.

235
00:12:16,626 --> 00:12:18,127
I WAS WONDERING IF YOU KNEW
WHAT HE MIGHT DO

236
00:12:18,127 --> 00:12:19,929
IF HE WERE IN MY SITUATION.

237
00:12:19,929 --> 00:12:25,168
- HMM, REBUILDING THE AIR NATION
WAS AANG'S BIGGEST DREAM.

238
00:12:25,168 --> 00:12:28,771
HE WOULD BE BESIDE HIMSELF
WITH JOY WITH WHAT YOU'VE DONE,

239
00:12:28,771 --> 00:12:30,973
AND IF HE ACCOMPLISHED
THAT GOAL,

240
00:12:30,973 --> 00:12:34,811
HE MIGHT HAVE SACRIFICED
ANYTHING TO PROTECT IT.

241
00:12:34,811 --> 00:12:37,580
- SO HE WOULD GIVE HIMSELF UP
TO SAVE THE AIR NATION?

242
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:39,515
- I DON'T KNOW FOR SURE.

243
00:12:39,515 --> 00:12:42,452
THE AIRBENDERS MIGHT HAVE BEEN
CLOSEST TO AANG'S HEART,

244
00:12:42,452 --> 00:12:45,088
BUT AS THE AVATAR,
HE WAS CONCERNED

245
00:12:45,088 --> 00:12:47,090
WITH PEOPLE OF ALL NATIONS.

246
00:12:47,090 --> 00:12:50,593
NO ONE KNEW BETTER THAN AANG
THAT IN TIMES OF TURMOIL

247
00:12:50,593 --> 00:12:53,996
THE WORLD NEEDS ITS AVATAR
THE MOST.

248
00:12:53,996 --> 00:12:56,632
- THANKS.
YOUR UNCLE WAS RIGHT.

249
00:12:56,632 --> 00:12:58,267
IT WAS HELPFUL TALKING TO YOU.

250
00:12:58,267 --> 00:13:01,537
- WAIT, YOU SPOKE
WITH MY UNCLE?

251
00:13:01,537 --> 00:13:04,006
- YES, IN THE SPIRIT WORLD.

252
00:13:04,006 --> 00:13:05,508
A COUPLE OF TIMES ACTUALLY.

253
00:13:05,508 --> 00:13:07,210
[footsteps approaching]

254
00:13:07,210 --> 00:13:09,712
- GUYS, WE GOT THROUGH
TO THE AIR TEMPLE.

255
00:13:11,013 --> 00:13:12,215
- WHO IS THIS?

256
00:13:12,215 --> 00:13:15,151
- I TOLD YOU,
IT'S BOLIN!

257
00:13:15,151 --> 00:13:18,187
- BOLIN'S NOT HERE RIGHT NOW,
CAN I TAKE A MESSAGE?

258
00:13:18,187 --> 00:13:21,657
- NO, I'M NOT LOOKING FOR BOLIN,
I AM BOLIN!

259
00:13:21,657 --> 00:13:24,160
AHH, LOOK, I NEED YOU
TO FIND YOUR DAD.

260
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,795
- HE'S OUTSIDE WITH THE BISON.

261
00:13:25,795 --> 00:13:29,298
DID YOU KNOW WE FOUND
A WHOLE HERD FULL OF BABY BISON?

262
00:13:29,298 --> 00:13:32,201
- NO.
A WHOLE HERD, REALLY?

263
00:13:32,201 --> 00:13:33,469
[grunts]

264
00:13:33,469 --> 00:13:35,238
- MEELO,
THIS IS YOUR COMMANDING OFFICER.

265
00:13:35,238 --> 00:13:36,739
GO GET YOUR DAD, NOW.

266
00:13:36,739 --> 00:13:38,841
- YES, SIR.

267
00:13:40,543 --> 00:13:43,479
- COME ON.
COME ON.

268
00:13:43,479 --> 00:13:45,014
- HELLO, THIS IS TENZIN.

269
00:13:45,014 --> 00:13:46,382
- TENZIN, LISTEN TO ME
CAREFULLY.

270
00:13:46,382 --> 00:13:48,151
ZAHEER IS ON HIS WAY
TO THE TEMPLE.

271
00:13:48,151 --> 00:13:49,685
HE'S COMING
FOR THE AIRBENDERS.

272
00:13:49,685 --> 00:13:51,954
YOU HAVE TO GET EVERYONE
OUT OF THERE IMMEDIATELY.

273
00:13:51,954 --> 00:13:54,557
DROP EVERYTHING.
LEAVE NOW!

274
00:13:54,557 --> 00:13:58,027
- OH, NO.
- WHAT? WHAT IS IT?

275
00:13:58,027 --> 00:14:00,696
TENZIN!
TENZIN, WHAT'S HAPPENING?

276
00:14:00,696 --> 00:14:03,699
- IT'S TOO LATE.

277
00:14:03,699 --> 00:14:06,602
HE'S HERE.

278
00:14:17,508 --> 00:14:18,876
- WHAT IS IT, DADDY?

279
00:14:18,876 --> 00:14:20,678
- WE NEED TO GET EVERYONE
OUT OF HERE.

280
00:14:20,678 --> 00:14:22,746
STAY CLOSE TO ME.

281
00:14:32,556 --> 00:14:34,058
- WHAT'S GOING ON, TENZIN?

282
00:14:34,058 --> 00:14:36,227
- IT'S ZAHEER.
ROUND EVERYONE UP.

283
00:14:36,227 --> 00:14:39,396
WE NEED TO GET TO THE BISON
AND EVACUATE IMMEDIATELY.

284
00:14:44,034 --> 00:14:45,903
- GUYS, WE GOT AN EMERGENCY.

285
00:14:45,903 --> 00:14:49,740
WE'RE EVACUATING THE TEMPLE.
COME ON.

286
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:52,109
LOOK OUT!

[door opens]

288
00:15:00,584 --> 00:15:02,753
- IT'S ZAHEER.
WE HAVE TO LEAVE.

- [screams]

290
00:15:07,258 --> 00:15:10,528
- NO ONE'S GOING ANYWHERE,
OR SHE GETS IT.

291
00:15:16,033 --> 00:15:18,969
- GOOD, THE ENTIRE FAMILY
IS HERE.

292
00:15:28,112 --> 00:15:31,348
IT'S A PLEASURE TO FINALLY MEET
A TRUE AIRBENDING MASTER.

293
00:15:31,348 --> 00:15:33,017
- WHAT IS IT
YOU WANT FROM US?

294
00:15:33,017 --> 00:15:34,218
- NOTHING AT ALL.

295
00:15:34,218 --> 00:15:37,054
IN FACT,
IF EVERYONE COOPERATES,

296
00:15:37,054 --> 00:15:39,723
YOU WILL ALL WALK OUT
OF THIS SITUATION UNHARMED.

297
00:15:39,723 --> 00:15:41,258
- THEN WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

298
00:15:41,258 --> 00:15:44,428
- I WANT KORRA,
AND I'M TIRED OF CHASING HER.

299
00:15:44,428 --> 00:15:47,364
- YOU'RE USING US AS LEVERAGE?
- YES.

300
00:15:47,364 --> 00:15:49,266
- I WILL NEVER LET YOU
GET TO KORRA.

301
00:15:49,266 --> 00:15:52,803
- UNFORTUNATELY,
YOU DON'T HAVE A CHOICE.

302
00:15:52,803 --> 00:15:54,705
- YES, I DO.

303

[all grunt]

304
00:15:57,475 --> 00:15:59,143
JINORA, GET EVERYONE
OUT OF HERE.

305
00:15:59,143 --> 00:16:03,481
BUMI, KYA,
HELP ME HOLD THEM OFF.

306
00:16:08,719 --> 00:16:11,922

AS MUCH FUN AS I AM.

- WAIT, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
