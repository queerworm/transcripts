I CAN TAKE IT.

175
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:31,667
- AH! AH!

176
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:38,083
- ALL RIGHT,
THE SPARRING MATCH IS OVER.

177
00:10:42,417 --> 00:10:44,166
- I THOUGHT I WAS READY.

178
00:10:44,208 --> 00:10:46,375
- THERE IS NO SHAME
IN TAKING THE TIME YOU NEED

179
00:10:46,417 --> 00:10:48,333
TO MAKE A FULL RECOVERY.

180
00:10:48,375 --> 00:10:51,125
BEING THE AVATAR CAN WAIT.

181
00:10:51,166 --> 00:10:53,291
- BUT WHAT ABOUT
THE EARTH KINGDOM?

182
00:10:53,333 --> 00:10:55,333
I HEAR IT'S STILL
A MESS OUT THERE.

183
00:10:55,375 --> 00:10:57,208
- THE SITUATION
HAS BEEN STABILIZING

184
00:10:57,250 --> 00:10:59,000
SINCE KUVIRA TOOK CHARGE.

185
00:10:59,041 --> 00:11:01,375
- BUT THAT SHOULD BE ME OUT
THERE FIXING THINGS, NOT HER.

186
00:11:01,417 --> 00:11:04,500
- I KNOW YOU WANT TO HELP,
BUT TRUST ME,

187
00:11:04,542 --> 00:11:06,417
EVERYONE HAS THIS UNDER CONTROL.

188
00:11:06,458 --> 00:11:08,625
I JUST THINK YOU NEED TO...

189
00:11:08,667 --> 00:11:10,500
- IF YOU SAY, "BE PATIENT,"

190
00:11:10,542 --> 00:11:12,917
I SWEAR I'M GONNA
WATER-SMACK YOU IN THE MOUTH.

191
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:17,333
- NO, I WAS GOING
TO SAY YOU NEED TO...

192
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:20,333
NOT WORRY ABOUT THE FUTURE.

193
00:11:20,375 --> 00:11:22,750
BE GRATEFUL
FOR WHERE YOU ARE NOW

194
00:11:22,792 --> 00:11:24,208
AND THE PROGRESS YOU'VE MADE.

- THERE'S SOMETHING
I NEED TO TELL YOU BOTH.

212
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:16,834
- WHAT IS IT?

213
00:12:16,875 --> 00:12:18,959
- I WANT TO GO BACK
TO REPUBLIC CITY.

214

- ARE YOU SURE?
- I KNOW I'M NOT 100% YET,

BUT I FEEL LIKE I'VE HIT A WALL.

216
00:12:24,375 --> 00:12:26,333
I NEED TO BE
WHERE THE ACTION IS,

00:12:26,375 --> 00:12:28,959
WHERE MY FRIENDS ARE.

TO REPUBLIC CITY

00:12:36,917 --> 00:12:38,667
AND HAVE SOME TIME
TO CLEAR MY HEAD.

223
00:12:38,709 --> 00:12:41,125
IT WILL BE GOOD FOR ME.

AIN'T YA?

FOR MY WALL OF AVATARS?

- IT'LL ONLY TAKE A SECOND.

00:13:18,291 --> 00:13:22,542
AVATAR AANG WAS A BIG FAN
OF MY SEAWEED WRAPS, YOU KNOW,

233
00:13:22,583 --> 00:13:26,625
SO I NAMED THEM "AANG ROLLS."
NOW THEY'RE MY BIGGEST SELLER.

234
00:13:26,667 --> 00:13:29,333
AND THEY AIN'T EVEN GOT
FISH IN 'EM.

NOW SMILE.

236

GET BACK HERE!

- OH, DON'T WORRY.
THE AVATAR'S RIGHT HERE.

00:13:48,208 --> 00:13:50,041
WELL, WHAT ARE YOU
WAITING FOR?

243
00:13:50,083 --> 00:13:52,500
GO GET 'EM!

IT'S THE AVATAR!

00:15:56,333 --> 00:15:58,000
- YOU SURE?

252
00:15:58,041 --> 00:15:59,917
I DON'T SENSE
ANY RAAVA ENERGY AROUND HER.

253
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:02,917
BESIDES, SHE'S NOT DRESSED
LIKE THE AVATAR.

254
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:05,250
DOESN'T THE AVATAR
HAVE PONYTAILS?

255
00:16:05,291 --> 00:16:08,750
- DO YOU MIND?
I'M TRYING TO CONCENTRATE HERE.

256
00:16:08,792 --> 00:16:09,917
AND, YES, I AM THE AVATAR.

257
00:16:09,959 --> 00:16:11,667
I'M JUST
WEARING DIFFERENT CLOTHES

258
00:16:11,709 --> 00:16:13,000
AND I CUT MY HAIR.

259
00:16:13,041 --> 00:16:16,834
- SEE?
I TOLD YOU GUYS IT WAS HER.

260
00:16:16,875 --> 00:16:18,959
HOW COME YOU'VE BEEN
AWAY SO LONG?

261
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,834
- I WAS HURT PRETTY BAD
AWHILE AGO,

262
00:16:20,875 --> 00:16:23,250
AND LOST TOUCH
WITH MY AVATAR SPIRIT.

263
00:16:23,291 --> 00:16:25,709
- NO WONDER I COULDN'T FEEL
RAAVA'S ENERGY.

264
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:28,542
- I CAME TO THE TREE OF TIME
HOPING TO RECONNECT WITH RAAVA

265
00:16:28,583 --> 00:16:30,709
AND TURN ON
THE AVATAR STATE AGAIN.

266
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:32,417
BUT IT'S NOT WORKING.

267
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:35,458
THE LAST TIME I WAS HERE
I SAW ALL SORTS OF VISIONS.

268
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:37,166
NOW I DON'T SEE ANYTHING.

269
00:16:37,208 --> 00:16:39,583
- MAYBE WE CAN HELP YOU
GET BETTER.

270
00:16:39,625 --> 00:16:41,917
- I'M SORRY, BUT FOR YEARS
PEOPLE HAVE BEEN SAYING

271
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:44,083
THEY CAN HELP ME
GET BETTER.

272
00:16:44,125 --> 00:16:46,417
NOTHING'S WORKED.

273
00:16:46,458 --> 00:16:50,125
I NEED TO FIGURE THIS OUT
ON MY OWN.

YOU SHOULD HAVE TOLD ME

I FOUND YOU

- HOW DID YOU KNOW
I WAS OUT THERE?

- I'M PRETTY TAPPED INTO
THE GOINGS-ON AROUND HERE.

WHAT BRINGS YOU
TO THE SWAMP, ANYWAY?

- A SPIRIT LED ME HERE

330
00:21:45,709 --> 00:21:48,208

I WAS SUPPOSED TO FIND SOMEONE.

00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:50,667
IS THAT YOU?
- BEATS ME.

CALLED YOU HERE,

YOU SHOULD PROBABLY
LISTEN TO THEM.

- WAIT, YOU RECOGNIZE ME?
- IN A MANNER OF SPEAKING.

WE WERE GOOD FRIENDS
IN YOUR PREVIOUS LIFE.
