1
00:00:05,906 --> 00:00:07,173
Earth.

2
00:00:07,808 --> 00:00:09,260
Fire.

3
00:00:09,892 --> 00:00:11,085
Air.

4
00:00:11,409 --> 00:00:12,639
Water.

5
00:00:13,713 --> 00:00:18,049
Only the Avatar can
master all four elements

6
00:00:18,051 --> 00:00:20,818
and bring balance to the world.

7
00:00:25,891 --> 00:00:27,625
The Avatar has gone missing!

8
00:00:27,627 --> 00:00:29,727
Three years ago, Zaheer poisoned Korra,

9
00:00:29,729 --> 00:00:30,729
severely injuring her.

10
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:33,031
While her friends moved
on with their lives,

11
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:34,499
Korra remained in the south pole.

12
00:00:34,501 --> 00:00:36,221
Everyone thought she
was still recuperating,

13
00:00:36,245 --> 00:00:39,470
but six months ago, Korra left
home and hasn't been seen since.

14
00:00:39,472 --> 00:00:41,039
Even chief Tonraq was shocked to learn

15
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:42,761
that his daughter's
whereabouts are unknown.

16
00:00:42,785 --> 00:00:47,021
What has become of the Avatar
and when will she return?

17
00:01:01,027 --> 00:01:03,394
Hurry up in there!

18
00:01:03,396 --> 00:01:06,931
Come on, I got an emergency situation!

19
00:01:06,933 --> 00:01:09,300
Knock yourself out.

20
00:01:21,381 --> 00:01:22,413
Huh?

21
00:01:26,819 --> 00:01:29,320
You again.

22
00:01:39,698 --> 00:01:42,133
Leave me alone!

23
00:01:42,135 --> 00:01:43,534
What's wrong with her?

24
00:01:43,536 --> 00:01:45,803
Young lady, are you all right?

25
00:01:45,805 --> 00:01:48,172
Can I take you to a Doctor?

26
00:01:48,174 --> 00:01:52,543
No, I don't need any help.

27
00:01:56,615 --> 00:01:58,549
Now don't take this the wrong way,

28
00:01:58,551 --> 00:01:59,984
but I can't wait for you to leave.

29
00:01:59,986 --> 00:02:02,920
How else is she supposed to
take that but the wrong way?

30
00:02:02,922 --> 00:02:05,623
I mean because I've never
had a pen pal before.

31
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:07,158
I'm going to write you so many letters,

32
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,960
and just to get the ball rolling,

33
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:10,495
here. Spoiler alert.

34
00:02:10,497 --> 00:02:11,662
Pabu and I already miss you.

35
00:02:11,664 --> 00:02:14,899
Thanks, that's sweet. Are
you sure you don't want

36
00:02:14,901 --> 00:02:16,934
some company in the Southern water tribe?

37
00:02:16,936 --> 00:02:20,571
- I'm happy to come with you.
- No, I appreciate it,

38
00:02:20,573 --> 00:02:22,940
but I'll only be gone a couple weeks.

39
00:02:22,942 --> 00:02:24,542
A little time alone will be good for me.

40
00:02:24,544 --> 00:02:28,579
Now I don't want you to worry
about a thing while you're gone.

41
00:02:28,581 --> 00:02:31,115
Your recovery should be
your number one concern.

42
00:02:31,117 --> 00:02:36,120
Jinora, the airbenders and I
have everything under control.

43
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:38,990
Bye, Korra! Get better soon!

44
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:40,491
Don't forget to write!

45
00:02:56,475 --> 00:02:58,409
Ah!

46
00:03:07,019 --> 00:03:10,354
Can't sleep again?

47
00:03:10,356 --> 00:03:12,623
Honey, your father and
I have tried to give you

48
00:03:12,625 --> 00:03:16,661
as much space as you've
needed, but we're worried.

49
00:03:16,663 --> 00:03:19,163
You're not sleeping. You're barely eating.

50
00:03:19,165 --> 00:03:22,833
We don't want to push you,
but it's been three weeks.

51
00:03:22,835 --> 00:03:27,705
Will you please go see Katara?

52
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:30,841
All right. I'll go.

53
00:03:30,843 --> 00:03:33,711
You're going to get through this.

54
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:36,881
Oh, I love you so much.

55
00:03:40,586 --> 00:03:44,956
The poison did a lot of internal damage.

56
00:03:44,958 --> 00:03:46,524
Can you fix it?

57
00:03:46,526 --> 00:03:48,893
I can help guide your healing process,

58
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:52,897
but whether you get
better or not is up to you.

59
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:58,836
I know what it's like to go
through a traumatic experience,

60
00:03:58,838 --> 00:04:00,004
and I promise you,

61
00:04:00,006 --> 00:04:02,707
if you dedicate yourself to getting better,

62
00:04:02,709 --> 00:04:04,875
you'll recover stronger than ever.

63
00:04:04,877 --> 00:04:07,912
That's what I want, more than anything.

64
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:10,381
Then try something for me.

65
00:04:10,383 --> 00:04:13,818
Concentrate on your big toe.

66
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:17,355
Visualize it moving.

67
00:04:17,357 --> 00:04:18,889
Breathe.

68
00:04:26,465 --> 00:04:29,400
Did you see that?

69
00:04:29,402 --> 00:04:32,303
It worked!

70
00:04:33,338 --> 00:04:36,474
The mind can be a powerful ally

71
00:04:36,476 --> 00:04:38,075
or your greatest enemy.

72
00:04:38,077 --> 00:04:43,414
Now, I want you to try taking a step.

73
00:04:49,489 --> 00:04:50,621
Ah!

74
00:04:52,025 --> 00:04:53,391
Ugh!

75
00:04:53,393 --> 00:04:54,058
You're okay.

76
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:56,627
Your body thinks it's still in danger,

77
00:04:56,629 --> 00:04:57,962
but you're safe here.

78
00:04:57,964 --> 00:05:01,198
Use your mind to overcome the pain.

79
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:05,102
Try again. I'm done for today.

80
00:05:05,104 --> 00:05:07,104
"Dear Korra, I miss you.

81
00:05:07,106 --> 00:05:10,441
"It's not the same in
Republic city without you.

82
00:05:10,443 --> 00:05:14,378
"How are you feeling?
Things are going well here.

83
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:15,546
"I just got a big contract

84
00:05:15,548 --> 00:05:18,115
"to help redesign the
city's infrastructure,

85
00:05:18,117 --> 00:05:21,585
so I'll be keeping pretty busy for awhile."

86
00:05:21,587 --> 00:05:22,520
"Hey, Korra.

87
00:05:22,522 --> 00:05:24,955
"So, I'm not very good at writing letters.

88
00:05:24,957 --> 00:05:28,793
"It's 2:15 in the
afternoon. Weather is fair.

89
00:05:28,795 --> 00:05:31,095
"Chance of snow showers later today.

90
00:05:31,097 --> 00:05:35,499
"But enough joking around.
I hope you're doing well.

91
00:05:35,501 --> 00:05:36,934
"Me? I'm back on the beat.

92
00:05:36,936 --> 00:05:39,937
"Beifong has me staking
out the red monsoon hideout,

93
00:05:39,939 --> 00:05:43,040
you won't believe what's going down."

94
00:05:43,042 --> 00:05:44,675
"My dearest, Avatar Korra.

95
00:05:44,677 --> 00:05:47,645
"Though several fortnights have
passed since your departure,

96
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:50,715
"to convalesce in the
homeland of your tribesmen,

97
00:05:50,717 --> 00:05:55,119
"I feel our friendship knows
neither time nor distance.

98
00:05:55,121 --> 00:05:56,921
"You will be most pleased to learn

99
00:05:56,923 --> 00:05:58,203
"that I found gainful employment

100
00:05:58,227 --> 00:06:00,391
"with Sir Varrick and the lady Kuvira.

101
00:06:00,393 --> 00:06:03,427
"I set off on the morrow
with some trepidation,

102
00:06:03,429 --> 00:06:05,830
"but I am eager to offer any aid I can

103
00:06:05,832 --> 00:06:10,534
in stabilizing the Earth kingdom."

104
00:06:23,815 --> 00:06:26,751
Whenever you're ready. What's the point?

105
00:06:26,753 --> 00:06:28,486
We've been at this for almost six months

106
00:06:28,488 --> 00:06:31,989
and I can barely take a couple
of steps without collapsing.

107
00:06:31,991 --> 00:06:34,024
I know you're frustrated, but...

108
00:06:34,026 --> 00:06:37,194
Of course I'm frustrated!
A crazy man poisoned me,

109
00:06:37,196 --> 00:06:39,663
and now I can't dress
myself or cook for myself

110
00:06:39,665 --> 00:06:42,733
or do anything for
myself, and this whole time

111
00:06:42,735 --> 00:06:44,375
my friends have been off helping the world

112
00:06:44,399 --> 00:06:49,807
while I'm stuck with you,
and you can't even heal me!

113
00:06:49,809 --> 00:06:52,743
That came out wrong.

114
00:06:52,745 --> 00:06:53,878
It's all right.

115
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:57,615
Let your anger and
frustration flow like water.

116
00:06:57,617 --> 00:07:01,318
I am trying to understand
why this happened to me.

117
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,053
But nothing makes any sense.

118
00:07:03,055 --> 00:07:06,724
I'm tired, Katara. I'm so tired.

119
00:07:06,726 --> 00:07:10,561
Korra, I know you feel alone right now,

120
00:07:10,563 --> 00:07:11,996
but you're not the first Avatar

121
00:07:11,998 --> 00:07:14,432
who's had to overcome great suffering.

122
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:18,335
Can you imagine how much
pain Aang felt when he learned

123
00:07:18,337 --> 00:07:22,206
that his entire culture was taken from him?

124
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:24,842
That must have been so awful.

125
00:07:24,844 --> 00:07:27,678
But he never let it destroy his spirit.

126
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,881
He chose to find meaning in his suffering,

127
00:07:30,883 --> 00:07:33,050
and eventually found peace.

128
00:07:33,052 --> 00:07:37,054
And what am I gonna find
if I get through this?

129
00:07:37,056 --> 00:07:44,462
I don't know, but won't it
be interesting to find out?

130
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:49,834
Close your eyes.

131
00:07:49,836 --> 00:07:54,305
Visualize yourself walking over to Naga.

132
00:07:55,508 --> 00:07:57,441
Can you see it? Yes.

133
00:07:57,443 --> 00:08:02,646
Now, take that first step.

134
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:51,695
Where'd you come from, little cutie?

135
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,374
You can see her, too?

136
00:09:10,115 --> 00:09:14,451
If you can see her, too,
maybe I'm not going crazy.

137
00:09:20,693 --> 00:09:23,494
How'd you do that?

138
00:09:28,601 --> 00:09:31,502
You want me to follow you?

139
00:09:35,574 --> 00:09:40,344
All right, let's see what I find.

140
00:09:54,092 --> 00:09:55,125
It's so good to see you.

141
00:09:55,127 --> 00:09:58,495
How have you been, Korra. You look great.

142
00:09:58,497 --> 00:09:59,930
I feel great. Come on.

143
00:09:59,932 --> 00:10:03,767
I want to show you how
much better I'm doing.

144
00:10:13,078 --> 00:10:17,648
Attack! I can take it.

145
00:10:28,126 --> 00:10:31,595
Ah! Ah!

146
00:10:33,531 --> 00:10:37,935
All right, the sparring match is over.

147
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:42,773
I thought I was ready.

148
00:10:42,775 --> 00:10:45,643
There is no shame in
taking the time you need

149
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:47,544
to make a full recovery.

150
00:10:47,546 --> 00:10:49,980
Being the Avatar can wait.

151
00:10:49,982 --> 00:10:52,316
But what about the Earth kingdom?

152
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:54,084
I hear it's still a mess out there.

153
00:10:54,086 --> 00:10:56,453
The situation has been stabilizing

154
00:10:56,455 --> 00:10:57,455
since Kuvira took charge.

155
00:10:57,456 --> 00:11:00,958
But that should be me out
there fixing things, not her.

156
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:04,028
I know you want to help, but trust me,

157
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:06,397
everyone has this under control.

158
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:08,565
I just think you need to...

159
00:11:08,567 --> 00:11:09,767
If you say, "be patient,"

160
00:11:09,769 --> 00:11:12,202
I swear I'm gonna
watersmack you in the mouth.

161
00:11:12,204 --> 00:11:17,775
No, I was going to say you need to...

162
00:11:17,777 --> 00:11:20,010
Not worry about the future.

163
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:22,212
Be grateful for where you are now

164
00:11:22,214 --> 00:11:25,649
and the progress you've made.

165
00:11:27,052 --> 00:11:29,853
"Dear Asami, I'm sorry I
haven't written to you sooner,

166
00:11:29,855 --> 00:11:33,524
"but every time I've tried,
I never knew what to say.

167
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:36,860
"The past two years have
been the hardest of my life.

168
00:11:36,862 --> 00:11:39,196
"Even though I can get around fine now,

169
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:41,165
"I still can't go into the Avatar state.

170
00:11:41,167 --> 00:11:45,002
"I keep having visions of Zaheer
and what happened that day.

171
00:11:45,004 --> 00:11:47,638
"Katara thinks a lot of this is in my head,

172
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,239
"so I've been meditating a lot,

173
00:11:49,241 --> 00:11:52,776
"but sometimes I worry
I'll never fully recover.

174
00:11:52,778 --> 00:11:54,678
"Please don't tell Mako and Bolin.

175
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:56,480
"I wrote to you and not them.

176
00:11:56,482 --> 00:11:58,115
"I don't want to hurt their feelings,

177
00:11:58,117 --> 00:12:01,085
"but it's easier to tell
you about this stuff.

178
00:12:01,087 --> 00:12:03,787
I don't think they'd understand."

179
00:12:08,827 --> 00:12:11,228
Everything all right, sweetie?

180
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:15,599
There's something I need to tell you both.

181
00:12:15,601 --> 00:12:16,266
What is it?

182
00:12:16,268 --> 00:12:18,068
I want to go back to Republic city.

183
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:21,605
Are you sure? I know I'm not 100% yet,

184
00:12:21,607 --> 00:12:23,741
but I feel like I've hit a wall.

185
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:25,976
I need to be where the action is,

186
00:12:25,978 --> 00:12:28,278
where my friends are.

187
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:30,714
I'll have the white lotus prepare a boat

188
00:12:30,716 --> 00:12:33,016
and they can take you back to Republic city

189
00:12:33,018 --> 00:12:34,551
as soon as you're ready.

190
00:12:34,553 --> 00:12:36,153
No, I want to go alone.

191
00:12:36,155 --> 00:12:38,422
And have some time to clear my head.

192
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:40,991
It will be good for me.

193
00:12:59,978 --> 00:13:02,212
Two lobster crabs, please.

194
00:13:02,214 --> 00:13:05,582
Why, you're the Avatar, ain't ya?

195
00:13:05,584 --> 00:13:07,684
Yep, that's me.

196
00:13:07,686 --> 00:13:08,852
I can't believe it!

197
00:13:08,854 --> 00:13:13,824
Mind if I take a picture
for my wall of avatars?

198
00:13:13,826 --> 00:13:15,859
I'm kind of in a hurry.

199
00:13:15,861 --> 00:13:17,261
It'll only take a second.

200
00:13:17,263 --> 00:13:21,198
Avatar Aang was a big fan of
my seaweed wraps, you know,

201
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:25,869
so I named them "Aang rolls."
Now they're my biggest seller.

202
00:13:25,871 --> 00:13:29,139
And they ain't even got fish in 'em.

203
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:32,009
Now smile.

204
00:13:32,011 --> 00:13:34,111
But if could have met any Avatar,

205
00:13:34,113 --> 00:13:35,913
I'd have to pick Kyoshi.

206
00:13:35,915 --> 00:13:38,615
Taking down a shark squid with one hand?

207
00:13:38,617 --> 00:13:41,518
Now that's a lady I'd like to get to know.

208
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:44,054
Thieves! Get back here!

209
00:13:44,056 --> 00:13:47,591
Oh, don't worry. The Avatar's right here.

210
00:13:47,593 --> 00:13:49,860
Well, what are you waiting for?

211
00:13:49,862 --> 00:13:52,796
Go get 'em!

212
00:13:56,434 --> 00:14:01,438
Hand over the bags or else.

213
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,874
Ah! Ugh!

214
00:14:09,614 --> 00:14:12,816
You sure she's the Avatar?

215
00:15:47,946 --> 00:15:52,749
Everyone, come here! It's the Avatar!

216
00:15:55,954 --> 00:15:56,954
You sure?

217
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:58,922
I don't sense any Raava energy around her.

218
00:15:58,924 --> 00:16:01,959
Besides, she's not dressed like the Avatar.

219
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:04,227
Doesn't the Avatar have ponytails?

220
00:16:04,229 --> 00:16:08,031
Do you mind? I'm trying
to concentrate here.

221
00:16:08,033 --> 00:16:09,232
And, yes, I am the Avatar.

222
00:16:09,234 --> 00:16:11,101
I'm just wearing different clothes

223
00:16:11,103 --> 00:16:12,035
and I cut my hair.

224
00:16:12,037 --> 00:16:15,906
See? I told you guys it was her.

225
00:16:15,908 --> 00:16:17,975
How come you've been away so long?

226
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:19,876
I was hurt pretty bad awhile ago,

227
00:16:19,878 --> 00:16:22,045
and lost touch with my Avatar spirit.

228
00:16:22,047 --> 00:16:24,181
No wonder I couldn't feel Raava's energy.

229
00:16:24,183 --> 00:16:27,617
I came to the tree of time
hoping to reconnect with Raava

230
00:16:27,619 --> 00:16:30,053
and turn on the Avatar state again.

231
00:16:30,055 --> 00:16:31,088
But it's not working.

232
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:34,825
The last time I was here
I saw all sorts of visions.

233
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:36,126
Now I don't see anything.

234
00:16:36,128 --> 00:16:38,428
Maybe we can help you get better.

235
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:41,098
I'm sorry, but for years
people have been saying

236
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:43,667
they can help me get better.

237
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:45,569
Nothing's worked.

238
00:16:45,571 --> 00:16:50,340
I need to figure this out on my own.

239
00:17:00,151 --> 00:17:01,184
"Dear mom and dad,

240
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:03,820
"I arrived in Republic
city a couple weeks ago

241
00:17:03,822 --> 00:17:05,255
"and couldn't be happier.

242
00:17:05,257 --> 00:17:06,990
"It's nice to be back at the temple,

243
00:17:06,992 --> 00:17:08,825
"and it's great to see my friends again.

244
00:17:08,827 --> 00:17:11,628
"Don't worry, I'm taking it easy,

245
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:14,898
"but hopefully I'll be back in action soon.

246
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:17,034
"I miss you both very much.

247
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:20,704
"Please give Naga a big hug for me.

248
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:26,710
Love, Korra."

249
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:29,112
Raava?

250
00:17:29,114 --> 00:17:31,948
Raava!

251
00:17:53,504 --> 00:17:57,707
I am ending this.

252
00:18:22,401 --> 00:18:27,504
Excuse me, who do I talk to
about getting in the ring?

253
00:18:41,719 --> 00:18:44,921
Is that all you got?

254
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,000
We have a winner!

255
00:18:59,104 --> 00:19:01,972
Hurry up in there!

256
00:19:09,013 --> 00:19:17,013
Why did you bring me to the swamp?

257
00:19:22,493 --> 00:19:24,861
Wait, I met you at the tree of time.

258
00:19:24,863 --> 00:19:27,464
You should have told me who you were.

259
00:19:27,466 --> 00:19:30,433
If I did, would you have followed me?

260
00:19:30,435 --> 00:19:32,102
I get your point.

261
00:19:32,104 --> 00:19:34,037
But why did you bring me here?

262
00:19:34,039 --> 00:19:36,206
What am I gonna find in the swamp?

263
00:19:36,208 --> 00:19:40,410
Not a what. A who.

264
00:19:40,412 --> 00:19:42,746
No, wait!

265
00:19:42,748 --> 00:19:45,081
Come back!

266
00:19:56,093 --> 00:19:57,994
You're just in my mind.

267
00:19:57,996 --> 00:20:02,098
You're not real.

268
00:20:17,014 --> 00:20:18,582
Ah! Ugh!

269
00:20:18,584 --> 00:20:22,586
Ahh!

270
00:20:58,656 --> 00:21:01,458
Ah!

271
00:21:10,202 --> 00:21:13,370
Help!

272
00:21:24,916 --> 00:21:27,517
Feeling better?

273
00:21:27,519 --> 00:21:29,953
Where am I? What happened?

274
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:32,656
I was hoping you could tell me.

275
00:21:32,658 --> 00:21:34,658
I found you passed out in the mud.

276
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:36,026
How did you know I was out there?

277
00:21:36,028 --> 00:21:40,063
I'm pretty tapped into
the goings-on around here.

278
00:21:40,065 --> 00:21:43,099
What brings you to the swamp, anyway?

279
00:21:43,101 --> 00:21:44,401
A spirit led me here

280
00:21:44,403 --> 00:21:47,170
and told me I was supposed to find someone.

281
00:21:47,172 --> 00:21:49,506
- Is that you?
- Beats me.

282
00:21:49,508 --> 00:21:52,642
But if your Avatar senses called you here,

283
00:21:52,644 --> 00:21:55,011
you should probably listen to them.

284
00:21:55,013 --> 00:21:58,982
- Wait, you recognize me?
- In a manner of speaking.

285
00:21:58,984 --> 00:22:03,520
We were good friends in your previous life.

286
00:22:07,858 --> 00:22:10,527
I can't believe it.

287
00:22:10,529 --> 00:22:13,096
Toph?

288
00:22:13,098 --> 00:22:17,115
Nice to see you again, twinkletoes.
