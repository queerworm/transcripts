1
00:00:07,747 --> 00:00:09,514
Earth.

2
00:00:09,515 --> 00:00:11,383
Fire.

3
00:00:11,384 --> 00:00:12,951
Air.

4
00:00:12,952 --> 00:00:14,920
Water.

5
00:00:14,921 --> 00:00:16,688
Only the Avatar

6
00:00:16,689 --> 00:00:19,357
can master all four elements

7
00:00:19,358 --> 00:00:24,358
and bring balance to the world.

8
00:00:26,933 --> 00:00:29,401
The Avatar has gone missing.

9
00:00:29,402 --> 00:00:31,336
After President Raiko
refused Korra's request

10
00:00:31,337 --> 00:00:33,438
to aid the South
in the War of the Water Tribes,

11
00:00:33,439 --> 00:00:34,873
she headed to the Fire Nation,

12
00:00:34,874 --> 00:00:37,375
seeking a new ally against Unalaq.

13
00:00:37,376 --> 00:00:38,944
But unbeknownst to her friends,

14
00:00:38,945 --> 00:00:40,412
a dark spirit attacked Korra

15
00:00:40,413 --> 00:00:42,547
and dragged her into the ocean.

16
00:00:42,548 --> 00:00:43,749
She has washed up
on a desolate island

17
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:48,750
with no memory of who she is.

18
00:01:02,568 --> 00:01:04,870
We found the Avatar
washed up onshore,

19
00:01:04,871 --> 00:01:07,572
but she doesn't remember anything.

20
00:01:07,573 --> 00:01:09,808
Raava.

21
00:01:09,809 --> 00:01:14,809
Raava. Raava.

22
00:01:15,915 --> 00:01:19,417
- A dark energy has infected her.

23
00:01:19,418 --> 00:01:21,720
We must purge it before it destroys

24
00:01:21,721 --> 00:01:25,323
her Avatar spirit.

25
00:01:25,324 --> 00:01:28,426
Let the waters cleanse the darkness

26
00:01:28,427 --> 00:01:30,962
that plagues your spirit.

27
00:01:48,815 --> 00:01:52,250
- Who are you?
- I am you.

28
00:01:52,251 --> 00:01:55,520
- Who am I?

29
00:01:55,521 --> 00:01:57,989
- You are the Avatar.

30
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:02,990
- I don't know what that is.

31
00:02:04,297 --> 00:02:06,398
- In order to remember,

32
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:09,201
you must regain your connection

33
00:02:09,202 --> 00:02:13,271
with your Avatar spirit.

34
00:02:13,272 --> 00:02:17,275
- If you don't,
darkness will engulf the world.

35
00:02:17,276 --> 00:02:21,279
You will die,
and our era will end.

36
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:24,282
- How do I regain my connection?

37
00:02:24,283 --> 00:02:28,253
- Go back.
Return to the beginning.

38
00:02:28,254 --> 00:02:33,254
Find Raava.

39
00:02:42,301 --> 00:02:43,368
- Are you Raava?

40
00:02:43,369 --> 00:02:46,872
- No, but I can help you find her.

41
00:02:46,873 --> 00:02:48,773
My name is Wan,
and I will show you

42
00:02:48,774 --> 00:02:53,774
how I became the first Avatar.

43
00:02:57,617 --> 00:02:59,718
- Nobody steals from the Chou brothers!

44
00:02:59,719 --> 00:03:02,587
- Really?
Because I just did.

45
00:03:02,588 --> 00:03:04,923
- You're dead, Wan.

46
00:03:04,924 --> 00:03:09,924
- Actually, I feel quite alive.

47
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:24,809
- Hey, stop!

48
00:03:41,627 --> 00:03:43,862
Hey, fellas.

49
00:03:43,863 --> 00:03:45,463
You're just in time for lunch!

50
00:03:45,464 --> 00:03:46,898
- Oh!

51
00:03:50,636 --> 00:03:54,272
- I told you no one steals from us.

52
00:04:21,467 --> 00:04:22,867
Did you steal from the Chous again?

53
00:04:22,868 --> 00:04:24,803
- Yeah, and I got nothing
to show for it

54
00:04:24,804 --> 00:04:29,341
except a few dirty rolls
and a whole lot of bruises.

55
00:04:29,342 --> 00:04:34,342
Hey, Yao, I got some food for you.

56
00:04:34,647 --> 00:04:36,781
- Mmm.
Delicious.

57
00:04:36,782 --> 00:04:37,882
Thank you, Wan.

58
00:04:42,955 --> 00:04:47,392
- You guys are hungry too, huh?

59
00:04:47,393 --> 00:04:49,227
- Wan, you should eat.

60
00:04:49,228 --> 00:04:51,563
They need it more than I do.

61
00:04:51,564 --> 00:04:54,432
Besides, I'm tired of eating scraps.

62
00:04:54,433 --> 00:04:55,567
If only there was some way

63
00:04:55,568 --> 00:04:56,801
to get into the Chous' food cellar.

64
00:04:56,802 --> 00:04:59,838
We'd be eating like--
well, like Chous.

65
00:04:59,839 --> 00:05:02,774
- If Chou the Elder catches you
sneaking into his palace,

66
00:05:02,775 --> 00:05:04,376
you'll end up dead.

67
00:05:04,377 --> 00:05:07,445
Or worse, he'll banish you
to the Spirit Wilds.

68
00:05:07,446 --> 00:05:08,780
- No, don't get banished.

69
00:05:08,781 --> 00:05:11,783
You don't want nothing to do
with those spirits.

70
00:05:11,784 --> 00:05:14,919
They'll get inside ya,
scramble up your mind,

71
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:19,891
turn ya into this-- a monster!

72
00:05:19,892 --> 00:05:21,693
- Don't do anything crazy, Wan.

73
00:05:21,694 --> 00:05:24,562
You just gotta accept
the world is the way it is.

74
00:05:24,563 --> 00:05:26,898
Some people have power.
Some people don't.

75
00:05:26,899 --> 00:05:27,932
And you don't.

76
00:05:30,669 --> 00:05:34,372
Not yet, anyway.

77
00:05:34,373 --> 00:05:36,808
- Are you strong?
Are you fearless?

78
00:05:36,809 --> 00:05:39,711
Do you have what it takes
to battle the spirits?

79
00:05:39,712 --> 00:05:41,613
Then join the hunt.

80
00:05:41,614 --> 00:05:45,316
- Count me in.

81
00:05:47,553 --> 00:05:49,921
We're going to be out
in the wilds for a week.

82
00:05:49,922 --> 00:05:51,790
You wouldn't last two seconds.

83
00:05:51,791 --> 00:05:54,392
- I can handle myself.

84
00:05:54,393 --> 00:05:55,660
We all get fire, right?

85
00:05:55,661 --> 00:05:58,563
- Yeah, but do you know how to use it?

86
00:05:58,564 --> 00:06:01,266
- Well, not exactly, but I--

87
00:06:01,267 --> 00:06:02,667
- Ah, let him come.

88
00:06:02,668 --> 00:06:04,736
Not like we got
any other volunteers lining up.

89
00:06:04,737 --> 00:06:07,839
- All right.
Welcome to the hunt.

90
00:06:37,203 --> 00:06:38,803
- The lion turtle.

91
00:06:38,804 --> 00:06:40,705
- Great guardian of our city,

92
00:06:40,706 --> 00:06:42,941
we are venturing into the Spirit Wilds

93
00:06:42,942 --> 00:06:45,410
to bring back food for our people.

94
00:06:45,411 --> 00:06:48,580
Please, grant us the power of fire.

95
00:06:48,581 --> 00:06:52,417
- The power is yours to keep

96
00:06:52,418 --> 00:06:55,854
until your return.

97
00:06:55,855 --> 00:07:00,792
- You're first, kid.

98
00:07:00,793 --> 00:07:04,195
- May the element of fire

99
00:07:04,196 --> 00:07:09,196
protect you against the spirits.

100
00:07:11,237 --> 00:07:14,506
- Whoa!

101
00:07:14,507 --> 00:07:18,343
- Just make sure you aim
at the spirits, not us, okay?

102
00:07:18,344 --> 00:07:23,344
- Sure thing.

103
00:07:26,785 --> 00:07:28,520
- Everyone stay close.

104
00:07:28,521 --> 00:07:30,855
Spirits love to pick off stragglers.

105
00:07:30,856 --> 00:07:32,857
- Uh, guys?

106
00:07:32,858 --> 00:07:34,792
I don't think I can do this.

107
00:07:34,793 --> 00:07:36,494
- Now, quit your whining.

108
00:07:36,495 --> 00:07:38,196
We haven't even seen a spirit yet.

109
00:07:38,197 --> 00:07:40,465
- I think I wanna go home.

110
00:07:40,466 --> 00:07:43,801
- I knew you were nothing
but a sniveling coward.

111
00:07:43,802 --> 00:07:46,437
Go give your fire back
to the lion turtle,

112
00:07:46,438 --> 00:07:51,438
and don't ever show
your face around me again.

113
00:07:57,283 --> 00:07:59,284
- Wan, you're back.

114
00:07:59,285 --> 00:08:03,488
- What goodies did you snatch
for us this time?

115
00:08:05,357 --> 00:08:06,624
- What did you do?

116
00:08:06,625 --> 00:08:08,660
You can't steal from the lion turtle.

117
00:08:08,661 --> 00:08:13,661
- Really?
Because I just did.

118
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,240
- You know it's forbidden

119
00:08:22,241 --> 00:08:24,576
to bring the power
of the element into the city.

120
00:08:24,577 --> 00:08:26,611
Please, go back to the lion turtle

121
00:08:26,612 --> 00:08:28,379
and return the fire.

122
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:32,217
- Jaya, it's time to stop
being so afraid of the Chous

123
00:08:32,218 --> 00:08:37,218
and show them we have the power
to change things.

124
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:44,662
Hey, Chous!
Open the gate, and let us in.

125
00:08:44,663 --> 00:08:47,932
- What are those filthy peasants
doing here?

126
00:08:47,933 --> 00:08:51,803
- Don't worry, father.
We'll take care of them.

127
00:08:53,939 --> 00:08:56,374
- Hand over all the food
you're hoarding,

128
00:08:56,375 --> 00:08:57,976
and we won't give you any trouble.

129
00:09:00,813 --> 00:09:02,547
- You're not getting past us.

130
00:09:02,548 --> 00:09:05,316
We have the weapons.
You're powerless.

131
00:09:05,317 --> 00:09:09,420
- Powerless, huh?

132
00:09:12,391 --> 00:09:17,391
Follow me!

133
00:09:20,633 --> 00:09:24,535
Grab as much food as you can.

134
00:09:24,536 --> 00:09:26,170
- Maybe you're right.

135
00:09:26,171 --> 00:09:28,473
Maybe we do have the power
to change things.

136
00:09:28,474 --> 00:09:29,774
- Stop right there!

137
00:09:29,775 --> 00:09:31,743
- Looks like the Chous found backup.

138
00:09:31,744 --> 00:09:33,811
- Get everyone out of here.

139
00:09:33,812 --> 00:09:38,616
I'll hold them off.

140
00:09:50,863 --> 00:09:54,832
- No, please.
Have mercy.

141
00:09:54,833 --> 00:09:59,337
Wan?

142
00:10:02,241 --> 00:10:07,241
- Even when you have the power,
you're afraid to use it.

143
00:10:10,549 --> 00:10:13,918
- Tell me who else
was involved in the rebellion,

144
00:10:13,919 --> 00:10:16,554
and I might take mercy on you.

145
00:10:16,555 --> 00:10:18,423
- I'm not telling you anything.

146
00:10:18,424 --> 00:10:21,693
- Then, you've left me no choice.

147
00:10:21,694 --> 00:10:25,596
Wan, you are hereby banished.

148
00:10:25,597 --> 00:10:29,000
- Yeah! And give back
the fire you stole.

149
00:10:29,001 --> 00:10:31,836
- No!
Wait.

150
00:10:31,837 --> 00:10:33,838
Great lion turtle, I am sorry

151
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:36,841
for stealing the fire from you,
and I accept my punishment.

152
00:10:36,842 --> 00:10:38,476
But please, I need to be able

153
00:10:38,477 --> 00:10:40,345
to protect myself in the wilds.

154
00:10:40,346 --> 00:10:44,349
- Never again may you return

155
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:47,618
to this city.

156
00:10:47,619 --> 00:10:49,954
But I will allow you

157
00:10:49,955 --> 00:10:54,859
to keep the power of the element.

158
00:11:05,404 --> 00:11:09,307
- Bet he doesn't last till morning.

159
00:11:26,925 --> 00:11:29,961
- Hey, watch where
you're stepping, human!

160
00:11:29,962 --> 00:11:33,431
- Who said that?
- Down here!

161
00:11:33,432 --> 00:11:36,501
How'd you like it if I started
walking all over you?

162
00:11:36,502 --> 00:11:39,904
You're just a little frog.

163
00:11:39,905 --> 00:11:43,841
- Who's little now?

164
00:12:35,561 --> 00:12:37,995
Get off me!
Get off me!

165
00:12:59,918 --> 00:13:03,554
- You are not welcome
in my oasis, human.

166
00:13:03,555 --> 00:13:05,957
- Please, help me.

167
00:13:05,958 --> 00:13:08,426
I'm starving,
and I haven't slept all night.

168
00:13:08,427 --> 00:13:11,262
- Not my problem.

169
00:13:11,263 --> 00:13:13,931
- Let me pass.

170
00:13:13,932 --> 00:13:18,932
- You dare use fire against me?

171
00:13:19,238 --> 00:13:21,205
Now, be gone with you!

172
00:13:49,001 --> 00:13:51,769
- And who might you be?

173
00:13:51,770 --> 00:13:55,006
- I am Bushy, the bush spirit.

174
00:13:55,007 --> 00:13:58,809
And I would like to enter your oasis.

175
00:13:58,810 --> 00:14:03,447
- Very well.
You may pass.

176
00:14:05,417 --> 00:14:07,251
Wait a second!

177
00:14:07,252 --> 00:14:08,886
Something stinks.

178
00:14:08,887 --> 00:14:11,522
I knew I smelled a human!

179
00:14:17,362 --> 00:14:19,931
Come on, let me in,
just for a little while.

180
00:14:19,932 --> 00:14:23,734
- No!
Go back to your lion turtle.

181
00:14:23,735 --> 00:14:25,970
- Believe me,
I'd love to go back home.

182
00:14:25,971 --> 00:14:28,406
But I can't.
I was kicked out.

183
00:14:28,407 --> 00:14:31,709
- That's too bad.
- Poor human.

184
00:14:31,710 --> 00:14:33,611
- Don't pity him.

185
00:14:33,612 --> 00:14:35,513
He's just like every other human:

186
00:14:35,514 --> 00:14:37,281
ugly, destructive,

187
00:14:37,282 --> 00:14:39,951
and lacking any respect for nature.

188
00:14:39,952 --> 00:14:44,188
- Who are you calling ugly, ugly?

189
00:14:44,189 --> 00:14:44,855
- Hmm.

190
00:14:44,856 --> 00:14:47,224
- If you can't go back to your city,

191
00:14:47,225 --> 00:14:48,693
then you should go live
in another one.

192
00:14:48,694 --> 00:14:50,962
- What?
There are other lion turtles?

193
00:14:50,963 --> 00:14:52,463
- "There are
other lion turtles?"

194
00:14:52,464 --> 00:14:54,832
Of course there are, dozens of them!

195
00:14:54,833 --> 00:14:57,668
Boy, you humans are stupid too.

196
00:14:57,669 --> 00:15:00,471
- So which way
to the nearest lion turtle city?

197
00:15:00,472 --> 00:15:01,639
- Hmm.

198
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:03,374
I think it's on the other side

199
00:15:03,375 --> 00:15:05,643
of None-of-Your-Business Valley.

200
00:15:11,783 --> 00:15:13,250
- Real funny.

201
00:15:13,251 --> 00:15:14,485
You know what?
I don't need your help.

202
00:15:14,486 --> 00:15:18,923
I'll find it myself.

203
00:15:18,924 --> 00:15:19,924
- Good luck!

204
00:15:43,482 --> 00:15:48,482
It's okay.
I'm gonna get you out of there.

205
00:15:49,287 --> 00:15:51,455
- Finally, we caught something.

206
00:15:51,456 --> 00:15:53,924
Get it down.

207
00:15:53,925 --> 00:15:54,959
- Back off.

208
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:57,561
- Wan?
What are you doing here?

209
00:15:57,562 --> 00:15:58,796
- I'm saving this animal.

210
00:15:58,797 --> 00:16:01,265
- That animal's our dinner.

211
00:16:01,266 --> 00:16:03,367
Now, get out of the way.

212
00:16:03,368 --> 00:16:05,903
- No.

213
00:16:24,256 --> 00:16:25,656
- Ahh!

214
00:16:25,657 --> 00:16:30,657
He--help! Help!

215
00:16:37,636 --> 00:16:40,304
- Get 'em off!
Get 'em off!

216
00:16:40,305 --> 00:16:43,207
Ahh!

217
00:16:46,945 --> 00:16:51,945
- Well, looks like
you're all out of tricks, Wan.

218
00:16:54,953 --> 00:16:59,223
- I really hate humans!

219
00:16:59,224 --> 00:17:03,327
- No, no.

220
00:17:10,535 --> 00:17:12,636
- I don't know
what he's screaming about.

221
00:17:12,637 --> 00:17:17,637
He's better-looking now.

222
00:17:19,811 --> 00:17:22,513
- I feel great.
What's in this water?

223
00:17:22,514 --> 00:17:25,683
- It has special healing properties.

224
00:17:25,684 --> 00:17:27,518
- Thanks.

225
00:17:27,519 --> 00:17:30,521
So what did you do to that hunter?

226
00:17:30,522 --> 00:17:32,256
- Spirits are able to take over

227
00:17:32,257 --> 00:17:34,492
a human body for a short time.

228
00:17:34,493 --> 00:17:35,926
If I stayed in there any longer,

229
00:17:35,927 --> 00:17:39,330
I would've killed him,
which I did consider.

230
00:17:39,331 --> 00:17:40,698
- Thanks for saving my neck.

231
00:17:40,699 --> 00:17:42,867
But Why'd you do it?

232
00:17:42,868 --> 00:17:45,970
- I saw you save the cat-deer
from those hunters.

233
00:17:45,971 --> 00:17:48,272
I've never seen such an act

234
00:17:48,273 --> 00:17:50,407
of selflessness
from a human before.

235
00:17:50,408 --> 00:17:51,942
- Told you
I wasn't like the others.

236
00:17:51,943 --> 00:17:55,312
- Guess I underestimated you, human.

237
00:17:55,313 --> 00:17:58,215
- Are you off to find
another lion turtle city?

238
00:17:58,216 --> 00:17:59,550
- I was.

239
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:02,253
But I think I've had enough
of humans for a while.

240
00:18:02,254 --> 00:18:03,320
I've decided to stay here

241
00:18:03,321 --> 00:18:05,356
and learn the ways of the spirits.

242
00:18:05,357 --> 00:18:07,491
- What a great idea.
- That'll be fun.

243
00:18:07,492 --> 00:18:08,793
- Oh, now, now, hold on.

244
00:18:08,794 --> 00:18:11,428
A human living with spirits?

245
00:18:11,429 --> 00:18:12,730
It's never been done.

246
00:18:12,731 --> 00:18:13,864
- First time for everything, right?

247
00:18:13,865 --> 00:18:15,666
- Hmm.

248
00:18:15,667 --> 00:18:17,701
I guess we can try it.

249
00:18:17,702 --> 00:18:20,371
I've never had a human as a pet before.

250
00:18:20,372 --> 00:18:22,907
I think I'll call you "Stinky."

251
00:18:22,908 --> 00:18:24,708
- The name is Wan.

252
00:18:24,709 --> 00:18:29,709
- Stinky is more accurate.

253
00:18:30,749 --> 00:18:32,383
- What happened in the wilds?

254
00:18:32,384 --> 00:18:33,517
Where are the others?

255
00:18:33,518 --> 00:18:35,920
- Gone.
Spirits took them.

256
00:18:35,921 --> 00:18:37,855
They were protecting that kid Wan

257
00:18:37,856 --> 00:18:40,224
like he was one of their own.

258
00:18:40,225 --> 00:18:43,961
- Did you hear that?
Wan's still alive.

259
00:18:58,543 --> 00:19:00,644
- And the way Wan moves fire,

260
00:19:00,645 --> 00:19:02,847
it's like nothing I've ever seen.

261
00:19:02,848 --> 00:19:07,484
He uses it like
it's an extension of his body.

262
00:19:24,870 --> 00:19:27,371
- Wan has proven
that with the power of fire,

263
00:19:27,372 --> 00:19:29,640
anyone can survive in the wilds.

264
00:19:29,641 --> 00:19:31,208
We don't have to live

265
00:19:31,209 --> 00:19:33,744
under Chou the elder's rules anymore,

266
00:19:33,745 --> 00:19:36,547
so I say we leave this city
and start over.

267
00:19:36,548 --> 00:19:37,748
Who's with me?

268
00:19:59,304 --> 00:20:00,371
- You ready to go, Mula?

269
00:20:00,372 --> 00:20:02,506
- You sure you want to leave?

270
00:20:02,507 --> 00:20:05,209
- Yes, it's time I see
the rest of the world

271
00:20:05,210 --> 00:20:06,944
and find the other lion turtle cities.

272
00:20:06,945 --> 00:20:10,648
- I'm proud to call you
my friend, Stinky.

273
00:20:10,649 --> 00:20:12,549
Thank you for everything.

274
00:20:12,550 --> 00:20:14,285
Good-bye, everyone.

275
00:20:14,286 --> 00:20:17,288
- We'll miss you.

276
00:20:40,412 --> 00:20:43,347
- The all-powerful spirits are battling.

277
00:20:43,348 --> 00:20:45,983
- They're gonna wipe out
the entire valley!

278
00:21:11,776 --> 00:21:14,411
- Stop, or you'll destroy everything!

279
00:21:14,412 --> 00:21:17,414
- This doesn't concern you, human!

280
00:21:17,415 --> 00:21:18,482
- It does when the lives

281
00:21:18,483 --> 00:21:21,819
of spirits and animals are in danger.

282
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:24,421
- If you're a friend to spirits,

283
00:21:24,422 --> 00:21:27,891
then use your fire
to help me break free.

284
00:21:27,892 --> 00:21:30,961
- Don't involve the human.
This is between us.

285
00:21:30,962 --> 00:21:34,231
- Please, save me.

286
00:21:34,232 --> 00:21:38,235
She has tormented me
for 10,000 years.

287
00:21:38,236 --> 00:21:41,572
- 10,000 years?

288
00:21:41,573 --> 00:21:44,241
Let him go!

289
00:22:00,859 --> 00:22:03,260
- Thank you, human.

290
00:22:03,261 --> 00:22:08,261
You have performed
a great service for the spirits.

291
00:22:12,604 --> 00:22:14,805
- Do you realize what you've done?

292
00:22:14,806 --> 00:22:18,275
- Yeah, I helped a spirit
who was being bullied by you.

293
00:22:18,276 --> 00:22:20,511
- You are gravely mistaken.

294
00:22:20,512 --> 00:22:22,946
I was keeping him under control.

295
00:22:22,947 --> 00:22:24,548
- And what gives you the right?

296
00:22:24,549 --> 00:22:27,818
- You don't even know who I am, do you?

297
00:22:27,819 --> 00:22:29,920
- Should I?
- Yes.

298
00:22:29,921 --> 00:22:32,923
My name is Raava.

299
00:22:32,924 --> 00:22:35,559
That spirit you freed is Vaatu.

300
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:39,430
He is the force
of darkness and chaos.

301
00:22:39,431 --> 00:22:42,533
I am the force of light and peace.

302
00:22:42,534 --> 00:22:44,368
Since the beginning of time,

303
00:22:44,369 --> 00:22:46,837
we have battled
over the fate of this world.

304
00:22:46,838 --> 00:22:49,973
And for the past 10,000 years,

305
00:22:49,974 --> 00:22:52,443
I have kept darkness under control

306
00:22:52,444 --> 00:22:54,545
and the world in balance,

307
00:22:54,546 --> 00:22:56,313
until you came along.

308
00:22:56,314 --> 00:22:59,483
- So by freeing Vaatu,

309
00:22:59,484 --> 00:23:01,385
I let chaos into the world?

310
00:23:01,386 --> 00:23:02,753
- Precisely.

311
00:23:02,754 --> 00:23:04,521
The human and spirit realms

312
00:23:04,522 --> 00:23:06,523
are headed toward annihilation,

313
00:23:06,524 --> 00:23:11,524
and it's all your fault.

314
00:23:12,864 --> 00:23:17,864
- Raava, I found you.
