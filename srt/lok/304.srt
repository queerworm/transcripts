1
00:00:01,377 --> 00:00:02,545
- Tenzin: EARTH.

2
00:00:03,421 --> 00:00:04,631
FIRE.

3
00:00:05,215 --> 00:00:06,257
AIR.

4
00:00:06,549 --> 00:00:07,759
WATER.

5
00:00:09,093 --> 00:00:13,014
ONLY THE AVATAR CAN MASTER
ALL FOUR ELEMENTS

6
00:00:13,097 --> 00:00:15,183
AND BRING BALANCE
TO THE WORLD.

7
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:22,774
AIRBENDERS ARE
MYSTERIOUSLY DISAPPEARING

8
00:00:22,857 --> 00:00:25,026
IN BA SING SE,
INCLUDING KAI.

9
00:00:25,109 --> 00:00:27,403
THE EARTH QUEEN DENIED ANY
KNOWLEDGE OF THE AIRBENDERS,

10
00:00:27,487 --> 00:00:29,656
BUT KORRA REFUSED
TO GIVE UP HER SEARCH.

11
00:00:29,739 --> 00:00:31,991
MEANWHILE, MAKO AND BOLIN
MET THEIR LONG-LOST RELATIVES,

12
00:00:32,075 --> 00:00:33,535
WHO TOLD THEM
THAT DAI LI AGENTS

13
00:00:33,618 --> 00:00:35,703
HAVE BEEN ROUNDING UP
AIRBENDERS FOR THE QUEEN'S ARMY.

14
00:00:35,787 --> 00:00:37,038
AND AT A PRISON
IN THE NORTH,

15
00:00:37,121 --> 00:00:40,333
TONRAQ AND LORD ZUKO PREPARE
FOR ZAHEER'S IMMINENT ATTACK.

16
00:01:06,985 --> 00:01:08,236
- DID YOU SEE ZAHEER?

17
00:01:08,736 --> 00:01:11,489
THE ONLY THING I SAW
WAS A SNOWSTORM HEADING OUR WAY.

18
00:01:14,659 --> 00:01:17,620
THAT'S NOT A SNOWSTORM.
THAT'S HIM.

19
00:01:43,479 --> 00:01:46,816
I PUT YOU AWAY ONCE, ZAHEER,
AND I'M GOING TO DO IT AGAIN.

20
00:02:41,037 --> 00:02:42,288
- MING-HUA.

21
00:02:42,705 --> 00:02:44,082
- LET'S GET YOU OUT OF HERE.

22
00:03:01,349 --> 00:03:05,103
WE COULD HAVE JUST TAKEN
THE ELEVATOR, SHOW-OFF.

23
00:03:20,368 --> 00:03:23,371
I'VE WAITED 13 YEARS
TO FEEL THIS WARM.

24
00:03:54,986 --> 00:03:56,863
I THOUGHT
I'D NEVER SEE YOU AGAIN.

25
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,614
- I NEVER DOUBTED.

26
00:04:02,076 --> 00:04:03,953
- REALLY? RIGHT NOW?

27
00:04:11,377 --> 00:04:12,670
- I GOT 'EM!

28
00:04:12,754 --> 00:04:15,256
THESE PASSPORTS SHOULD GET YOU
INTO THE UPPER RING.

29
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:18,926
AWESOME! TU, YOU'RE THE BEST
COUSIN A GUY COULD HAVE.

30
00:04:19,927 --> 00:04:21,971
AND MY OTHER COUSINS
AS WELL.

31
00:04:22,054 --> 00:04:23,681
YEAH.
YEAH, YOU'RE ALL THE BEST.

32
00:04:25,349 --> 00:04:27,560
THANKS.
I KNOW THIS WASN'T EASY.

33
00:04:28,186 --> 00:04:31,355
IT'S SUCH A SHAME
YOU TWO MUST LEAVE SO SOON.

34
00:04:31,647 --> 00:04:32,940
- I WISH WE COULD STAY.

35
00:04:33,024 --> 00:04:34,442
BUT IF IT'S TRUE
THE EARTH QUEEN

36
00:04:34,525 --> 00:04:36,611
IS FORCING AIRBENDERS
INTO HER ARMY,

37
00:04:36,694 --> 00:04:38,279
WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING
ABOUT IT.

38
00:04:38,362 --> 00:04:41,491
I LOVE YOU BOTH.
COME VISIT AGAIN.

39
00:04:41,991 --> 00:04:43,284
- WE WILL, GRANDMA.

40
00:04:43,993 --> 00:04:45,703
- I LOVE YOU TOO, GRANDMA.

41
00:04:46,537 --> 00:04:49,248
AND CHOW AND TU

42
00:04:49,874 --> 00:04:52,627
AND MENG-MENG
AND CHOW JR.

43
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:55,630
AND THERE HE IS,
BIG TEE AND LITTLE... LITTLE TEE,

44
00:04:55,713 --> 00:04:59,550
AND MEDIUM YU AND...AND...
AND WHAT WAS YOUR NAME AGAIN?

45
00:05:01,886 --> 00:05:04,222
I KNOW THAT EARTH QUEEN
IS LYING TO ME.

46
00:05:04,305 --> 00:05:07,475
I CAN TELL BY THAT STUPID
LITTLE QUEENY SMIRK OF HERS!

47
00:05:07,767 --> 00:05:09,352
AND I CAN'T BELIEVE
I HELPED HER.

48
00:05:09,435 --> 00:05:11,395
I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN
SHE WAS USING ME!

49
00:05:13,815 --> 00:05:14,982
- WHOA! HEY!

50
00:05:15,066 --> 00:05:16,526
I THINK I COULD USE A BREAK.

51
00:05:16,609 --> 00:05:18,820
YOU LETTING OFF STEAM
IS STARTING TO...

52
00:05:19,111 --> 00:05:20,655
HURT...A LOT.

53
00:05:20,738 --> 00:05:21,739
- SORRY.

54
00:05:23,157 --> 00:05:24,742
MAKO! BOLIN!

55
00:05:25,076 --> 00:05:26,536
YOU'RE OKAY.

56
00:05:26,619 --> 00:05:27,912
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?

57
00:05:30,957 --> 00:05:32,166
- WE CHASED KAI...

58
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:33,835
TRAIN...
SLIPPED AWAY...

59
00:05:33,918 --> 00:05:36,337
LOWER RING...
SLEPT IN TRASH PILE...

60
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:37,839
MET OUR FAMILY...

61
00:05:37,922 --> 00:05:40,383
GRANDMA, TEARS...
MAKO SCARF...

62
00:05:40,466 --> 00:05:42,844
EARTH QUEEN LYING.

63
00:05:42,927 --> 00:05:44,011
MM.

64
00:05:44,679 --> 00:05:45,847
- CAN YOU INTERPRET THAT?

65
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:48,558
THE EARTH QUEEN'S BEEN
SECRETLY TAKING AIRBENDERS

66
00:05:48,641 --> 00:05:50,309
AND FORCING THEM
INTO HER ARMY.

67
00:05:50,768 --> 00:05:53,104
SHE WAS LYING.
I KNEW IT!

68
00:05:53,688 --> 00:05:55,648
I SWEAR,
THE NEXT TIME I SEE HER...

69
00:05:55,731 --> 00:05:56,941
- IT'S THE QUEEN.

70
00:06:01,445 --> 00:06:03,614
QUICK, PABU, SHIRT!

71
00:06:04,407 --> 00:06:07,243
I KNOW. SORRY.
KINDA SWEATY.

72
00:06:08,953 --> 00:06:11,956
GOOD, YOU'RE HERE.
GUN, TELL HER THE NEWS.

73
00:06:12,039 --> 00:06:14,375
WE'VE RECEIVED WORD
FROM THE YANG PROVINCE.

74
00:06:14,458 --> 00:06:16,836
THERE HAVE BEEN REPORTS
OF AIRBENDERS THERE.

75
00:06:16,919 --> 00:06:18,462
- WONDERFUL, ISN'T IT?

76
00:06:18,546 --> 00:06:20,548
IT'S THE VERY THING
YOU'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR.

77
00:06:20,631 --> 00:06:22,091
- THANK YOU.

78
00:06:22,174 --> 00:06:25,720
THAT IS JUST
THE MOST WONDERFUL NEWS, EVER.

79
00:06:25,887 --> 00:06:26,971
YAY.

80
00:06:27,346 --> 00:06:31,225
SO I ASSUME YOU AND YOUR...
FRIENDS HERE

81
00:06:31,309 --> 00:06:34,020
WILL BE LEAVING IMMEDIATELY.

82
00:06:34,103 --> 00:06:35,605
AHHH, AH-CHOO!

83
00:06:36,355 --> 00:06:37,481
AH-CHOO!

84
00:06:37,690 --> 00:06:39,442
AHHHH, AH-CHOO!

85
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:43,321
IS THERE AN ANIMAL
IN MY PRESENCE?

86
00:06:43,654 --> 00:06:44,697
- NO, YOUR MAJESTY.

87
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:47,033
I WOULD NEVER ALLOW
AN ANIMAL NEAR YOU.

88
00:06:47,992 --> 00:06:50,661
AH-CHOO!
AHH, AHH, AH-CHOO!

89
00:06:51,412 --> 00:06:54,790
IF I FIND ONE WITHIN
50 FEET OF ME,

90
00:06:54,874 --> 00:06:56,584
IT'S YOUR HEAD!

91
00:06:57,251 --> 00:07:00,922
ANYWAY, IF YOU NEED
ANY ASSISTANCE PACKING,

92
00:07:01,005 --> 00:07:02,089
LET GUN KNOW.

93
00:07:02,173 --> 00:07:05,176
HE'LL SEE TO IT THAT YOU ARE
ON YOUR WAY BY EVENING.

94
00:07:05,509 --> 00:07:07,094
- Kcrra: UH, THIS EVENING?

95
00:07:07,678 --> 00:07:10,097
I'M NOT SURE
ABOUT LEAVING SO SOON.

96
00:07:10,181 --> 00:07:12,350
BECAUSE OUR AIRSHIP
IS HAVING ENGINE TROUBLE.

97
00:07:12,433 --> 00:07:14,894
IT'LL TAKE ME UNTIL TOMORROW
TO FINISH THE REPAIRS.

98
00:07:15,853 --> 00:07:18,689
AHH, AHH, AH-CHOO!
AH-CHOO!

99
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:21,233
AH-CHOO!

100
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:24,737
THANKS FOR BUYING US
SOME TIME.

101
00:07:25,363 --> 00:07:26,781
I CAN'T BELIEVE
THE EARTH QUEEN

102
00:07:26,864 --> 00:07:28,032
IS CONSCRIPTING AIRBENDERS.

103
00:07:28,115 --> 00:07:30,868
THOSE PEOPLE SHOULD NOT
BE FORCED TO JOIN AN ARMY.

104
00:07:30,952 --> 00:07:31,953
- WELL, TECHNICALLY,

105
00:07:32,036 --> 00:07:34,246
THE EARTH QUEEN HAS A RIGHT
TO CONSCRIPT HER CITIZENS.

106
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:37,333
WHAT?
IT'S TRUE.

107
00:07:37,667 --> 00:07:39,794
GUYS, WHAT IF KAI
WAS SPOTTED AIRBENDING?

108
00:07:40,294 --> 00:07:41,963
HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN
TAKEN TOO.

109
00:07:42,046 --> 00:07:43,047
- PROBABLY NOT.

110
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:44,882
HE'S SURPRISINGLY DIFFICULT
TO CATCH.

111
00:07:44,966 --> 00:07:47,426
LIKE A...LIKE A LITTLE
GREASED HOG-MONKEY.

112
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:49,178
- BUT WHAT IF HE WAS?

113
00:07:50,221 --> 00:07:52,098
DON'T WORRY, JINORA.
WE'LL FIND HIM.

114
00:07:52,181 --> 00:07:54,016
WE JUST NEED TO FIGURE OUT
WHERE TO LOOK.

115
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:55,977
I BET
THEY'RE UNDER LAKE LAOGAI.

116
00:07:58,145 --> 00:08:00,606
WHAT? I'VE BEEN READING
SOME OF JINORA'S BOOKS.

117
00:08:01,232 --> 00:08:03,567
THE OLD DAI LI AGENTS
USED TO HAVE A SECRET FORTRESS

118
00:08:03,651 --> 00:08:04,694
BENEATH THE LAKE.

119
00:08:04,777 --> 00:08:05,820
- MAKO'S RIGHT.

120
00:08:05,903 --> 00:08:08,072
IT'S THE PERFECT SPOT
TO HIDE AIRBENDERS.

121
00:08:08,155 --> 00:08:10,825
AND I KNOW HOW TO CHECK IT OUT
WITHOUT BEING CAUGHT.

122
00:08:10,908 --> 00:08:12,952
I CAN PROJECT MY SPIRIT
INTO IT.

123
00:08:13,285 --> 00:08:15,496
YOU MEAN
THAT OUT-OF-BODY THING YOU DID

124
00:08:15,579 --> 00:08:17,039
TO HELP GIANT SPIRITY-KORRA?

125
00:08:17,123 --> 00:08:18,332
- YOU CAN STILL DO THAT?

126
00:08:18,416 --> 00:08:21,836
IT'S NOT AS POWERFUL AS IT WAS
DURING HARMONIC CONVERGENCE,

127
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:24,422
BUT IF I CAN GET CLOSE ENOUGH,
I THINK I CAN DO IT.

128
00:08:25,131 --> 00:08:26,674
- LET'S GO GET KAI OUT.

129
00:08:26,757 --> 00:08:28,426
LET'S GET
ALL THE AIRBENDERS OUT.

130
00:08:35,182 --> 00:08:37,351
YOU ARE THE PROPERTY
OF THE EARTH KINGDOM.

131
00:08:37,935 --> 00:08:40,646
YOU WILL BECOME THE EARTH
QUEEN'S ELITE FIGHTING FORCE

132
00:08:40,730 --> 00:08:42,106
AND PROTECT HER AT ALL COST.

133
00:08:42,189 --> 00:08:45,526
IT IS YOUR DUTY
TO SERVE THE EARTH QUEEN.

134
00:08:50,239 --> 00:08:51,282
- AAH!

135
00:08:54,285 --> 00:08:55,453
- GO EASY ON ME.

136
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,663
I'M NOT THAT GOOD.

137
00:09:03,586 --> 00:09:04,712
- NEVER SHOW MERCY!

138
00:09:04,795 --> 00:09:05,796
NOW ATTACK YOUR OPPONENT,

139
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:07,590
AND THIS TIME,
LIKE YOU MEAN IT.

140
00:09:12,344 --> 00:09:13,429
- SORRY.

141
00:09:13,512 --> 00:09:15,848
A SOLDIER NEVER APOLOGIZES
TO HIS ENEMY.

142
00:09:15,973 --> 00:09:16,974
- I'M NOT A SOLDIER.

143
00:09:17,475 --> 00:09:19,602
YOU WILL BE
WHEN I'M THROUGH WITH YOU.

144
00:09:29,153 --> 00:09:31,655
IF ANYTHING GOES WRONG,
COME BACK IMMEDIATELY.

145
00:09:31,989 --> 00:09:33,074
- I WILL.

146
00:10:10,402 --> 00:10:12,404
WHAT HAPPENED?
WHAT DID YOU SEE?

147
00:10:12,488 --> 00:10:15,950
THE AIRBENDERS AREN'T THERE.
IT'S COMPLETELY DESERTED.

148
00:10:16,784 --> 00:10:17,993
- THEY'RE NOT DOWN THERE?

149
00:10:18,077 --> 00:10:20,287
JINORA, YOU'VE READ
ALL ABOUT BA SING SE.

150
00:10:20,371 --> 00:10:21,747
CAN YOU THINK
OF ANY OTHER PLACES

151
00:10:21,831 --> 00:10:22,957
THE AIRBENDERS MIGHT BE?

152
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,625
I GUESS THEY COULD BE
IN THE CATACOMBS

153
00:10:24,708 --> 00:10:26,168
BENEATH THE UPPER RING

154
00:10:26,252 --> 00:10:28,754
OR THE ANCIENT SEWERS
BENEATH THE LOWER RING

155
00:10:28,838 --> 00:10:31,841
OR THE MAZE OF TUNNELS THAT
CONNECTS THE RINGS TOGETHER,

156
00:10:31,924 --> 00:10:33,634
OR THEY COULD BE...

157
00:10:33,717 --> 00:10:35,010
THERE ARE
JUST TOO MANY PLACES.

158
00:10:35,094 --> 00:10:36,887
THERE HAS TO BE
ANOTHER WAY TO LOCATE THEM.

159
00:10:36,971 --> 00:10:37,972
- MAYBE THERE IS.

160
00:10:38,055 --> 00:10:40,474
HOW DID YOU FIND ME
DURING HARMONIC CONVERGENCE?

161
00:10:40,558 --> 00:10:41,517
- I DON'T KNOW.

162
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,019
I JUST KIND OF FOCUSED
ON YOUR ENERGY.

163
00:10:44,645 --> 00:10:46,981
I THINK OUR
SPIRITUAL CONNECTION LED ME TO YOU.

164
00:10:47,064 --> 00:10:49,066
MAYBE YOU CAN FIND KAI
THE SAME WAY.

165
00:10:49,733 --> 00:10:51,485
I KNOW YOU TWO
HAVE A CONNECTION.

166
00:10:51,777 --> 00:10:53,445
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
A CONNECTION?

167
00:10:54,363 --> 00:10:56,282
I DON'T KNOW.
LET ME TRY.

168
00:11:12,256 --> 00:11:13,549
- UGH!

169
00:11:16,677 --> 00:11:17,761
- UGH!

170
00:11:25,728 --> 00:11:27,188
THANKS.
- YOU AGAIN!

171
00:11:27,688 --> 00:11:29,315
IF YOU HAVE TIME
TO HELP YOUR FRIEND,

172
00:11:29,398 --> 00:11:31,817
MAYBE YOU'RE NOT GETTING
ENOUGH ROCKS FOR YOURSELF.

173
00:11:45,956 --> 00:11:47,875
I GUESS YOU'RE NOT
AS GOOD AS YOU THOUGHT.

174
00:11:53,339 --> 00:11:54,673
THROW HIM IN THE HOLE!

175
00:12:14,026 --> 00:12:16,111
JINORA?
- IT WORKED!

176
00:12:16,987 --> 00:12:18,572
HOW ARE YOU HERE
RIGHT NOW?

177
00:12:18,656 --> 00:12:20,032
- SHH, QUIET.

178
00:12:20,449 --> 00:12:22,409
IT'S A HIGH-LEVEL
AIRBENDER MOVE...

179
00:12:22,493 --> 00:12:24,203
WITH A LITTLE SPIRITUAL STUFF
THROWN IN.

180
00:12:25,371 --> 00:12:27,915
FOR A SECOND THERE,
I THOUGHT YOU WERE A GHOST.

181
00:12:27,998 --> 00:12:29,833
IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU.

182
00:12:29,917 --> 00:12:32,419
WE'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR YOU
AND THE OTHER AIRBENDERS.

183
00:12:32,503 --> 00:12:34,630
WE'RE GOING TO GET YOU ALL
OUT OF HERE.

184
00:12:34,713 --> 00:12:35,881
WHERE ARE WE ANYWAY?

185
00:12:35,965 --> 00:12:37,591
- UNDERGROUND SOMEWHERE.

186
00:12:37,675 --> 00:12:39,760
OTHER THAN THAT,
I DON'T HAVE A CLUE.

187
00:12:39,843 --> 00:12:41,971
I'LL FIGURE IT OUT.
DON'T WORRY.

188
00:12:42,054 --> 00:12:44,682
JINORA...
THANKS.

189
00:12:57,361 --> 00:12:59,196
- THE EARTH QUEEN'S TEMPLE.

190
00:13:01,365 --> 00:13:03,492
Kcrra: I CAN'T BELIEVE
MISS QUEENY SMUGFACE

191
00:13:03,575 --> 00:13:05,786
HAD THEM RIGHT UNDER OUR NOSES
THE WHOLE TIME!

192
00:13:05,869 --> 00:13:08,080
WE HAVE TO GET
INTO THAT COMPOUND TONIGHT

193
00:13:08,163 --> 00:13:09,540
AND GET THOSE
AIRBENDERS OUT.

194
00:13:09,623 --> 00:13:12,042
ALL RIGHT, WE GO IN
UNDER THE COVER OF DARKNESS.

195
00:13:12,126 --> 00:13:15,004
TWO SMALL INSERTION TEAMS
AND A THIRD ON THE OUTSIDE.

196
00:13:15,296 --> 00:13:18,299
THEN ALL WE'LL NEED
IS 12 TONS OF BLASTING JELLY,

197
00:13:18,382 --> 00:13:20,301
A MEDIUM-SIZED BULLDOZER
AND...

198
00:13:20,384 --> 00:13:22,845
DOES ANYONE HAVE A BADGER-MOLE
THAT KNOWS MORSE CODE?

199
00:13:25,264 --> 00:13:27,266
OH, GREAT.
NOT THE QUEEN AGAIN.

200
00:13:27,349 --> 00:13:29,685
EVERYONE ACT NORMAL.
AND, BOLIN...

201
00:13:29,768 --> 00:13:30,894
- I'M ON IT!

202
00:13:32,855 --> 00:13:33,814
WHAT?

203
00:13:33,897 --> 00:13:35,858
HEY, I'M NOT SWEATY
THIS TIME.

204
00:13:40,696 --> 00:13:41,739
AH!

205
00:13:47,119 --> 00:13:49,246
LIN?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

206
00:13:49,621 --> 00:13:51,498
WE NEED TO GET KORRA
OUT OF HERE IMMEDIATELY.

207
00:13:51,582 --> 00:13:53,083
HER LIFE'S IN DANGER.
- WHAT?

208
00:13:53,834 --> 00:13:55,002
WHAT'S GOING ON?

209
00:13:55,085 --> 00:13:57,296
I JUST GOT WORD
FROM LORD ZUKO AND TONRAQ.

210
00:13:57,379 --> 00:13:59,423
WHY IS LORD ZUKO
WITH MY DAD?

211
00:13:59,506 --> 00:14:01,342
ZAHEER AND THE OTHERS
HAVE ESCAPED.

212
00:14:01,425 --> 00:14:03,135
- HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE?

213
00:14:03,218 --> 00:14:05,679
BECAUSE ZAHEER
IS AN AIRBENDER NOW.

214
00:14:05,763 --> 00:14:06,805
- NO.

215
00:14:07,222 --> 00:14:08,682
- ALL RIGHT, HOLD ON.

216
00:14:08,974 --> 00:14:11,935
WILL YOU QUIT IGNORING ME
AND TELL ME WHAT'S GOING ON?

217
00:14:12,102 --> 00:14:14,646
WHO'S ZAHEER?
WHY IS MY LIFE IN DANGER?

218
00:14:17,274 --> 00:14:19,860
SHORTLY AFTER WE FOUND OUT
YOU WERE THE AVATAR,

219
00:14:19,943 --> 00:14:22,488
ZAHEER AND THREE OTHERS
ATTEMPTED TO KIDNAP YOU.

220
00:14:23,113 --> 00:14:25,366
LUCKILY, YOUR FATHER,
LORD ZUKO, CHIEF SOKKA,

221
00:14:25,449 --> 00:14:27,242
AND I WERE THERE
TO STOP THEM.

222
00:14:27,326 --> 00:14:29,828
WE APPREHENDED THE CRIMINALS AND
LOCKED THEM AWAY IN PRISONS

223
00:14:29,912 --> 00:14:31,789
DESIGNED TO IMPAIR
THEIR ABILITIES.

224
00:14:31,872 --> 00:14:34,625
SO THAT'S WHY YOU AND MY DAD
SHELTERED ME AWAY.

225
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,668
- IT WAS FOR YOUR OWN SAFETY.

226
00:14:37,127 --> 00:14:38,962
WHY WERE THEY TRYING
TO KIDNAP KORRA?

227
00:14:39,046 --> 00:14:41,215
WE SPENT 13 YEARS
INTERROGATING THEM,

228
00:14:41,298 --> 00:14:42,633
BUT THEY NEVER BROKE.

229
00:14:42,716 --> 00:14:45,219
TO THIS DAY, NO ONE KNOWS
WHAT THEIR MOTIVE WAS.

230
00:14:45,302 --> 00:14:46,720
NOW WE NEED TO GET YOU BACK
TO REPUBLIC CITY,

231
00:14:46,804 --> 00:14:48,347
WHERE I CAN PROTECT YOU.

232
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:50,474
- NO, I'M NOT RUNNING.

233
00:14:50,808 --> 00:14:52,684
KORRA,
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

234
00:14:52,768 --> 00:14:55,354
THESE CRIMINALS ARE LIKE
NOTHING YOU'VE EVER FACED BEFORE.

235
00:14:55,687 --> 00:14:58,065
LOOK, I'M NOT
A LITTLE KID ANYMORE.

236
00:14:58,148 --> 00:14:59,691
YOU DON'T NEED
TO PROTECT ME.

237
00:15:00,192 --> 00:15:02,319
I CAME HERE FOR ONE THING...
TO FIND AIRBENDERS...

238
00:15:02,403 --> 00:15:03,862
AND I'M NOT LEAVING
WITHOUT THEM.

239
00:15:03,946 --> 00:15:05,989
FINE, LET'S GET 'EM
AND GET OUT OF HERE.

240
00:15:06,073 --> 00:15:07,074
WHERE ARE THEY?

241
00:15:07,157 --> 00:15:08,742
- IN A MILITARY COMPOUND,

242
00:15:08,826 --> 00:15:10,244
AND WE'RE BUSTING THEM OUT.

243
00:15:19,503 --> 00:15:21,755
- HI.
- HEY! WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

244
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:23,465
AW, IT'S JUST
THAT LITTLE AIRBENDER GIRL

245
00:15:23,549 --> 00:15:24,925
WHO CAME WITH THE AVATAR.

246
00:15:25,008 --> 00:15:27,302
YOU SHOULDN'T BE WALKING
AROUND HERE ALL ALONE.

247
00:15:27,386 --> 00:15:28,554
- I'M NOT ALONE.

248
00:15:52,536 --> 00:15:53,495
- BUMI AND KORRA,

249
00:15:53,579 --> 00:15:55,414
YOU TWO WILL COME WITH ME
TO FIND THE AIRBENDERS.

250
00:15:56,039 --> 00:15:57,374
YOU THREE FIND KAI.

251
00:15:57,875 --> 00:15:59,460
WE'LL MEET
ON THE SURFACE SHORTLY.

252
00:15:59,543 --> 00:16:01,378
RADIO US
IF ANYTHING GOES WRONG.

253
00:16:11,388 --> 00:16:13,891
WHAT'S GOING ON?
WHO ARE YOU?

254
00:16:13,974 --> 00:16:15,267
- I'M THE AVATAR,

255
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:16,935
AND I'M GETTING YOU ALL
OUT OF HERE.

256
00:16:17,019 --> 00:16:18,812
- WE'RE LEAVING?
- WHERE ARE WE GOING?

257
00:16:18,896 --> 00:16:22,149
EVERYONE, PLEASE,
YOU MUST STAY CALM AND QUIET

258
00:16:22,232 --> 00:16:23,442
IF WE WANT THIS TO WORK.

259
00:16:23,525 --> 00:16:24,860
- WHAT TO WORK?

260
00:16:25,569 --> 00:16:26,737
WE'RE SNEAKING OUT?

261
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:28,489
YES,
AND WE MUST LEAVE NOW.

262
00:16:28,572 --> 00:16:31,408
WE'RE GOING TO GET YOU AWAY FROM
THE EARTH QUEEN AND OUT OF THE CITY.

263
00:16:34,912 --> 00:16:36,705
THERE'S AN AIRBENDER
THAT'S NOT HERE.

264
00:16:36,788 --> 00:16:39,374
HIS NAME IS KAI.
WE NEED TO GET HIM.

265
00:16:39,458 --> 00:16:41,001
WE'RE ALREADY
TAKING CARE OF IT.

266
00:16:41,084 --> 00:16:44,046
TOPSIDE, THIS IS PAPA BEAR.
THE BREEZIES ARE IN THE HOLD.

267
00:16:44,129 --> 00:16:45,172
CUE THE BALLOONS.

268
00:16:45,255 --> 00:16:46,215
WHAT?

269
00:16:46,298 --> 00:16:47,633
ARE YOU IN TROUBLE?
- NO!

270
00:16:47,716 --> 00:16:49,968
WE GOT THE AIRBENDERS,
AND WE'RE HEADED OUT.

271
00:16:50,052 --> 00:16:51,637
BRING THE AIRSHIPS.

272
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:54,139
NO ONE LIKES CODE NAMES
ANYMORE.

273
00:16:54,264 --> 00:16:56,892
COPY THAT.
ASAMI AND I ARE ON OUR WAY.

274
00:17:06,568 --> 00:17:08,111
COME ON,
WE'RE GETTING YOU OUT.

275
00:17:08,195 --> 00:17:09,363
- KAI!

276
00:17:11,782 --> 00:17:12,866
MWAH!

277
00:17:14,076 --> 00:17:15,160
- WHOA!

278
00:17:15,244 --> 00:17:17,871
TENZIN'S NOT GOING
TO BE HAPPY ABOUT THIS.

279
00:17:17,955 --> 00:17:19,248
- THEN DON'T TELL HIM.

280
00:17:19,331 --> 00:17:21,750
HOW CAN I NOT?
THIS IS TOO JUICY!

281
00:17:21,833 --> 00:17:23,377
THANKS FOR COMING
TO GET ME.

282
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:26,004
I'M REALLY SORRY
ABOUT STEALING YOUR WALLETS

283
00:17:26,088 --> 00:17:27,381
AND RUNNING AWAY

284
00:17:27,464 --> 00:17:29,466
AND GETTING YOU STUCK
ON THAT TRAIN.

285
00:17:29,967 --> 00:17:33,011
OH, WE CAN'T STAY
MAD AT YOU!

286
00:17:33,136 --> 00:17:34,471
- YES, WE CAN.

287
00:17:34,555 --> 00:17:36,223
I HAD A LOT OF MONEY
IN THAT WALLET!

288
00:17:36,306 --> 00:17:37,558
- GUYS, COME ON.

289
00:17:40,936 --> 00:17:44,398
DESERTING HER MAJESTY'S
ARMY IS HIGH TREASON,

290
00:17:44,481 --> 00:17:46,066
PUNISHABLE BY DEATH.

291
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:56,285
- COME ON, IT'S CLEAR.

292
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:07,713
SO YOU'VE DISCOVERED
MY ELITE ARMY.

293
00:18:07,796 --> 00:18:10,841
I SEE THEIR LOYALTY
STILL NEEDS SOME WORK.

294
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:13,719
THESE AIRBENDERS
SHOULDN'T BE USED AS WEAPONS.

295
00:18:13,802 --> 00:18:15,387
THEY HAVE A RIGHT TO CHOOSE
THEIR OWN PATHS.

296
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:19,141
THESE AIRBENDERS
ARE EARTH KINGDOM CITIZENS,

297
00:18:19,224 --> 00:18:20,601
AND I AM THEIR QUEEN.

298
00:18:21,101 --> 00:18:23,186
TAKING THEM WILL CONSTITUTE
AN ACT OF WAR.

299
00:18:24,104 --> 00:18:28,275
IF YOU DISOBEY ME,
I WILL BEAR DOWN ON YOU

300
00:18:28,358 --> 00:18:30,402
WITH THE ENTIRE FORCE
OF MY KINGDOM!

301
00:18:31,528 --> 00:18:32,904
- THEY'RE LEAVING WITH ME.

302
00:18:32,988 --> 00:18:34,865
- NO, THEY'RE NOT!

303
00:18:55,636 --> 00:18:56,762
- COME ON!

304
00:19:34,508 --> 00:19:36,426
I GUESS I AM AS GOOD
AS I THOUGHT.

305
00:19:39,012 --> 00:19:41,390
EVERYONE'S IN. LET'S GO!

306
00:19:51,817 --> 00:19:53,110
OOGI!

307
00:20:01,243 --> 00:20:02,619
- TAKE DOWN THOSE AIRSHIPS!

308
00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:06,873
- WHERE ARE THE OTHERS?

309
00:20:07,624 --> 00:20:09,543
- WE NEED HELP!

310
00:20:24,516 --> 00:20:26,143
EVERYBODY, HANG ON!

311
00:20:32,315 --> 00:20:34,818
WHOA, THAT WAS AWESOME!

312
00:20:35,193 --> 00:20:37,279
BRING ME
THOSE AIRSHIPS NOW!

313
00:20:37,362 --> 00:20:39,406
AHH, AH-CHOO!

314
00:20:39,489 --> 00:20:41,950
OH, GET IT OFF ME!
AH-CHOO!

315
00:20:42,033 --> 00:20:45,120
GET THIS FUR OFF...
AHHH-CHOO!

316
00:20:53,003 --> 00:20:55,881
Tenzin: I KNOW THAT NONE OF YOU
CHOSE TO BECOME AIRBENDERS,

317
00:20:56,757 --> 00:20:58,842
BUT NOW YOU DO
HAVE A CHOICE.

318
00:20:59,426 --> 00:21:01,595
WE CAN RELOCATE YOU
SOMEWHERE SAFE,

319
00:21:01,678 --> 00:21:04,514
OR YOU CAN COME WITH ME
TO THE NORTHERN AIR TEMPLE

320
00:21:04,598 --> 00:21:07,851
TO LIVE IN PEACE
AND TRAIN AS AIR NOMADS.

321
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:10,729
YOU ARE NO LONGER
ANYONE'S PROPERTY.

322
00:21:10,812 --> 00:21:13,523
WHAT PATH YOU DECIDE
IS UP TO YOU.

323
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:18,695
- I WANT TO GO WITH YOU.

324
00:21:18,779 --> 00:21:20,322
- ME TOO.
- COUNT ME IN.

325
00:21:20,405 --> 00:21:21,865
- I WANNA GO TOO.
- I'LL GO TOO.

326
00:21:21,948 --> 00:21:23,033
- ME TOO.
- SOUNDS LIKE FUN.

327
00:21:23,116 --> 00:21:24,409
- I WANNA GO TOO.
- OOH, I WANNA GO.

328
00:21:28,622 --> 00:21:30,540
GOOD LUCK
AT THE NORTHERN AIR TEMPLE.

329
00:21:30,624 --> 00:21:32,501
I'LL SEND MORE AIRBENDERS
YOUR WAY WHEN I FIND THEM.

330
00:21:33,084 --> 00:21:35,462
BE CAREFUL OUT THERE,
AND STAY SAFE.

331
00:21:35,837 --> 00:21:36,922
- I'LL TRY.

332
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:39,883
IT SEEMS LIKE WHEREVER I GO,
I MAKE A NEW ENEMY.

333
00:21:40,258 --> 00:21:42,344
BUT YOU MADE
SOME NEW FRIENDS TOO.

334
00:21:43,011 --> 00:21:44,262
YOU DID WELL, KORRA.

335
00:21:45,555 --> 00:21:47,265
THIS IS
ONLY THE BEGINNING.
