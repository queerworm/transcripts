1
00:00:07,547 --> 00:00:09,548
Earth.

2
00:00:09,549 --> 00:00:11,049
Fire.

3
00:00:11,050 --> 00:00:13,051
Air.

4
00:00:13,052 --> 00:00:15,153
Water.

5
00:00:15,154 --> 00:00:18,957
Only the Avatar can master
all four elements

6
00:00:18,958 --> 00:00:21,259
and bring balance to the world.

7
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:29,501
Korra has reopened
the southern spirit portal

8
00:00:29,502 --> 00:00:31,470
and taken the first step
to restoring balance

9
00:00:31,471 --> 00:00:33,271
between spirits and man.

10
00:00:33,272 --> 00:00:35,674
Meanwhile, tensions are high
between Korra and her father

11
00:00:35,675 --> 00:00:38,376
after she discovered he was
hiding a dark secret--

12
00:00:38,377 --> 00:00:40,746
years ago,
Tonraq was banished from the North.

13
00:00:40,747 --> 00:00:44,149
And now the Northern navy
has landed on Southern shores.

14
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:49,150
What other plans does Unalaq
have for the Avatar?

15
00:01:00,066 --> 00:01:01,500
Soldier: Everyone, clear the streets.

16
00:01:01,501 --> 00:01:03,635
Get back in your homes.

17
00:01:31,264 --> 00:01:33,965
- Uncle, why did you bring
your troops down from the North?

18
00:01:33,966 --> 00:01:35,534
- Now that you've opened
the southern portal,

19
00:01:35,535 --> 00:01:37,235
we need to protect it from people

20
00:01:37,236 --> 00:01:38,837
who would do the spirits harm.

21
00:01:38,838 --> 00:01:40,005
- I can protect it.

22
00:01:40,006 --> 00:01:42,607
- I need you for something
more important.

23
00:01:42,608 --> 00:01:44,876
There is another portal in the North.

24
00:01:44,877 --> 00:01:48,046
Once you open it,
spirits and man will be able

25
00:01:48,047 --> 00:01:50,382
to move freely
between the North and the South

26
00:01:50,383 --> 00:01:52,117
in a matter of seconds.

27
00:01:52,118 --> 00:01:53,885
- But the solstice is over.

28
00:01:53,886 --> 00:01:55,253
How am I going to open it?

29
00:01:55,254 --> 00:01:58,723
- The spiritual energy
is much stronger in the North.

30
00:01:58,724 --> 00:02:00,959
And now that you've opened
the southern portal,

31
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:03,628
your energy is stronger as well.

32
00:02:03,629 --> 00:02:07,365
- With both portals open,
our tribes will be united again.

33
00:02:07,366 --> 00:02:12,366
- The world will be united again.

34
00:02:22,949 --> 00:02:26,351
- Ahh, I haven't felt
this at peace since--

35
00:02:26,352 --> 00:02:28,687
- Wahoo!

36
00:02:28,688 --> 00:02:32,257
- And it's over.
- Good morning, universe!

37
00:02:32,258 --> 00:02:34,926
- Bumi, please.
Cover yourself.

38
00:02:34,927 --> 00:02:36,261
- Well, lookee here.

39
00:02:36,262 --> 00:02:39,698
"Vacation Tenzin" has finally
decided to join us.

40
00:02:39,699 --> 00:02:42,267
- Yes, he has.

41
00:02:42,268 --> 00:02:44,469
It's so nice to get to spend more time

42
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:45,570
with my family.

43
00:02:45,571 --> 00:02:46,938
Isn't that right,

44
00:02:46,939 --> 00:02:48,607
my little Rohan?

45
00:02:50,209 --> 00:02:53,511
- And I've really enjoyed
having you two around.

46
00:02:53,512 --> 00:02:55,614
Reminds me of all those
great vacations we took

47
00:02:55,615 --> 00:02:57,048
as kids with Dad.

48
00:02:57,049 --> 00:02:59,818
- Uh, I think your memory
is a little foggy.

49
00:02:59,819 --> 00:03:02,687
Bumi and I weren't
on those great vacations.

50
00:03:02,688 --> 00:03:04,956
It was always just you and Dad.

51
00:03:04,957 --> 00:03:07,025
- No, that can't be right.

52
00:03:07,026 --> 00:03:08,994
What about the time he took us
to Kyoshi Island

53
00:03:08,995 --> 00:03:10,462
to ride the elephant-koi?

54
00:03:10,463 --> 00:03:12,764
- Nope.
We weren't there.

55
00:03:12,765 --> 00:03:14,199
- Hmm.

56
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:16,301
Oh, remember Ember Island?

57
00:03:16,302 --> 00:03:19,304
Those amazing sand palaces
we built on the beach?

58
00:03:19,305 --> 00:03:21,106
- You mean you built.

59
00:03:21,107 --> 00:03:22,641
We never saw the place.

60
00:03:22,642 --> 00:03:24,743
- I could've sworn--

61
00:03:27,313 --> 00:03:28,880
- Woo-hoo!
- Morning, kids.

62
00:03:28,881 --> 00:03:31,483
- Morning, Uncle Bumi.

63
00:03:31,484 --> 00:03:32,817
Do you have a baby in there?

64
00:03:36,188 --> 00:03:38,590
- Where's your sister?

65
00:03:38,591 --> 00:03:40,091
-' Who?

66
00:03:40,092 --> 00:03:43,461
- Ikki. About this tall.
Talks real fast.

67
00:03:43,462 --> 00:03:44,796
I'm sure you know her.

68
00:03:44,797 --> 00:03:46,464
- Uh...

69
00:03:46,465 --> 00:03:48,700
there was a lemur fight,
but the bison told us

70
00:03:48,701 --> 00:03:51,136
not to worry
because a giant was coming.

71
00:03:51,137 --> 00:03:53,772
Then we almost got eaten
by a shark-squid.

72
00:03:53,773 --> 00:03:56,741
- The shark-squid?
He's here?

73
00:03:56,742 --> 00:04:00,412
It appears my old nemesis
has found me.

74
00:04:00,413 --> 00:04:03,581
- Jinora, were you and Meelo
teasing your sister again?

75
00:04:03,582 --> 00:04:05,150
- I don't know.

76
00:04:05,151 --> 00:04:07,519
Maybe. Yes.

77
00:04:10,022 --> 00:04:11,623
- She ran away.

78
00:04:11,624 --> 00:04:16,227
- Honestly, I don't know why
you kids can't just get along!

79
00:04:16,228 --> 00:04:17,896
- It's all right, dear.

80
00:04:17,897 --> 00:04:20,665
Ikki couldn't have gone far.
I'll find her.

81
00:04:20,666 --> 00:04:23,134
- Commander Bumi reporting for duty!

82
00:04:23,135 --> 00:04:26,071
Search-and-rescue missions
are my specialty.

83
00:04:26,072 --> 00:04:28,840
- What do you say we all go together?

84
00:04:28,841 --> 00:04:30,709
- Sure.
I could use the help.

85
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:32,744
- When I get back,
we'll come up with a plan

86
00:04:32,745 --> 00:04:36,815
to take down that shark-squid
once and for all.

87
00:04:36,816 --> 00:04:38,000
- Yeah!

88
00:04:41,253 --> 00:04:43,288
- Thank you for coming, everyone.

89
00:04:43,289 --> 00:04:45,890
I know these last few days
have been very troubling.

90
00:04:45,891 --> 00:04:47,025
- Troubling?

91
00:04:47,026 --> 00:04:48,526
Troubling is when I get
that itchy rash

92
00:04:48,527 --> 00:04:49,661
that won't go away

93
00:04:49,662 --> 00:04:51,229
and Zhu Li's not around to scratch it.

94
00:04:51,230 --> 00:04:53,732
This is shocking.
Nay, sickening!

95
00:04:53,733 --> 00:04:55,900
But these kale cookies?
Opposite.

96
00:04:55,901 --> 00:04:58,536
Remind me to get the recipe later.

97
00:04:58,537 --> 00:05:00,171
- What's your point, Varrick?

98
00:05:00,172 --> 00:05:01,740
- My point is,

99
00:05:01,741 --> 00:05:03,475
Unalaq's already booted
our chieftains

100
00:05:03,476 --> 00:05:04,743
out of their palace.

101
00:05:04,744 --> 00:05:06,077
How long before he starts telling us

102
00:05:06,078 --> 00:05:07,779
what kind of cookies we can eat?

103
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:09,447
- Probably a couple of days.

104
00:05:09,448 --> 00:05:11,783
- Rhetorical question, Zhu Li.
You gotta keep up.

105
00:05:11,784 --> 00:05:14,019
Not to mention I've got
a cargo ship full of halibut

106
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:16,388
that's rotting,
thanks to this harbor lockdown.

107
00:05:16,389 --> 00:05:18,957
Who wants to buy a ship full
of stinking fish?

108
00:05:20,893 --> 00:05:23,628
Seriously, it's not rhetorical.
I need to sell these fish.

109
00:05:23,629 --> 00:05:25,897
- Chief Unalaq is here
to help the South.

110
00:05:25,898 --> 00:05:27,565
He wants to show us
how to restore balance

111
00:05:27,566 --> 00:05:29,367
with the spirits
so they'll stop attacking.

112
00:05:29,368 --> 00:05:32,404
- The only spirit
I'm interested in restoring

113
00:05:32,405 --> 00:05:34,205
is our spirit of independence!

114
00:05:34,206 --> 00:05:35,273
Am I right, people?

115
00:05:37,910 --> 00:05:39,611
- All Unalaq is trying to do

116
00:05:39,612 --> 00:05:41,880
is make our tribes unified again.

117
00:05:41,881 --> 00:05:44,783
- No, he wants control of our wealth.

118
00:05:44,784 --> 00:05:48,319
My wealth.
And I like my wealth.

119
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,155
If Unalaq doesn't pull
his forces out,

120
00:05:50,156 --> 00:05:53,024
then we have no choice
but to fight for our freedom!

121
00:05:54,627 --> 00:05:57,796
- You want to start a war?
Are you crazy?

122
00:05:57,797 --> 00:06:00,965
- Unalaq started this, not us.

123
00:06:02,535 --> 00:06:04,202
I'm sorry.

124
00:06:04,203 --> 00:06:06,504
Maybe you could speak
with your uncle,

125
00:06:06,505 --> 00:06:09,007
tell him how frustrated we all are.

126
00:06:09,008 --> 00:06:12,110
He'll listen to what
the Avatar has to say.

127
00:06:12,111 --> 00:06:14,079
Do it for me?

128
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:17,449
- I'll do it for the tribe.

129
00:06:18,684 --> 00:06:21,619
- I cannot stop eating these things.

130
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:24,155
Look, we all know
where this conflict is heading.

131
00:06:24,156 --> 00:06:28,460
We need to start preparing for war.

132
00:06:30,729 --> 00:06:32,964
- I will hate to leave
this quaint tribe.

133
00:06:32,965 --> 00:06:34,632
- Is that true, Eska?

134
00:06:34,633 --> 00:06:36,935
- Of course not, Desna.
I will not miss it at all.

135
00:06:36,936 --> 00:06:39,504
I hold immense dislike
for the South.

136
00:06:42,842 --> 00:06:44,576
Bolin!
Laugh at my humorous quip.

137
00:06:44,577 --> 00:06:47,812
- Yes, dear.

138
00:06:47,813 --> 00:06:49,881
So--so funny.

139
00:06:56,789 --> 00:06:59,057
You know,
I'll be really sad

140
00:06:59,058 --> 00:07:00,391
when you have to leave.

141
00:07:00,392 --> 00:07:03,061
It's been really great
getting to know you.

142
00:07:03,062 --> 00:07:04,295
Really.

143
00:07:04,296 --> 00:07:07,265
- But you will be coming
with me to the North.

144
00:07:07,266 --> 00:07:09,200
There we will live
the rest of our lives together

145
00:07:09,201 --> 00:07:11,236
in icy bliss.

146
00:07:11,237 --> 00:07:13,338
Foolish Bolin.

147
00:07:13,339 --> 00:07:15,807
- Mako!
I'm so happy to see you!

148
00:07:15,808 --> 00:07:17,175
- Uh, you all right, bro?

149
00:07:17,176 --> 00:07:18,309
- No!
No, I'm not all right!

150
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:19,711
I can't take any more.

151
00:07:19,712 --> 00:07:22,313
Listen, I don't want to live
in icy bliss with Eska!

152
00:07:22,314 --> 00:07:23,848
Don't make me!

153
00:07:23,849 --> 00:07:26,284
Oh, please,
please don't make me.

154
00:07:26,285 --> 00:07:28,086
- Uh, hey,
if you're that unhappy,

155
00:07:28,087 --> 00:07:29,687
just break up with her.

156
00:07:29,688 --> 00:07:31,990
- Break up with her?
You can do that?

157
00:07:31,991 --> 00:07:33,591
- Yeah.
Guys do it all the time.

158
00:07:33,592 --> 00:07:34,926
- How?

159
00:07:34,927 --> 00:07:36,661
- Just tell her you're not
that into her anymore.

160
00:07:36,662 --> 00:07:38,696
- Oh, no, no,
I don't think she'd like that.

161
00:07:38,697 --> 00:07:40,465
- Ending a relationship is kind of like

162
00:07:40,466 --> 00:07:42,534
pulling off a bloodsucking leech.

163
00:07:42,535 --> 00:07:44,435
You just gotta rip it off
and get it over with.

164
00:07:44,436 --> 00:07:46,171
You'll feel a lot better afterwards.

165
00:07:46,172 --> 00:07:47,739
Trust me.

166
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:49,607
- Thanks, Mako.
Whew.

167
00:07:49,608 --> 00:07:51,709
I'm lucky you're so good
at breaking girls' hearts.

168
00:07:51,710 --> 00:07:53,745
Korra better watch out.

169
00:07:53,746 --> 00:07:56,681
Ooh, no, it's just a--

170
00:07:56,682 --> 00:07:59,417
uh, you kn--
uh, never mind.

171
00:08:07,092 --> 00:08:09,761
- Our next training session
isn't until tomorrow.

172
00:08:09,762 --> 00:08:12,263
- I'm sorry to interrupt.

173
00:08:12,264 --> 00:08:14,465
It's about our conversation
this morning.

174
00:08:14,466 --> 00:08:15,733
- Yes?

175
00:08:15,734 --> 00:08:17,602
- I understand why
you brought your troops here,

176
00:08:17,603 --> 00:08:20,205
but I'm afraid it's sending
the wrong message.

177
00:08:20,206 --> 00:08:22,307
- Your father has been talking to you.

178
00:08:22,308 --> 00:08:24,642
- Not just him.
Varrick too.

179
00:08:24,643 --> 00:08:26,778
There was a meeting
at my parents' house.

180
00:08:26,779 --> 00:08:28,980
A lot of Southerners feel
like their tribe

181
00:08:28,981 --> 00:08:30,381
is being invaded.

182
00:08:30,382 --> 00:08:32,383
- I am their chief.

183
00:08:32,384 --> 00:08:34,919
I'm uniting, not invading.

184
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:38,723
- I know, but I'm just afraid
if something doesn't change,

185
00:08:38,724 --> 00:08:40,725
there could be a civil war.

186
00:08:40,726 --> 00:08:43,027
- If the Water Tribes were at war,

187
00:08:43,028 --> 00:08:45,296
the other nations would take sides.

188
00:08:45,297 --> 00:08:48,366
The dark spirits would thrive
off this negative energy,

189
00:08:48,367 --> 00:08:50,034
and the world would be thrown
into a battle

190
00:08:50,035 --> 00:08:51,703
between spirits and man

191
00:08:51,704 --> 00:08:53,304
that would be catastrophic.

192
00:08:53,305 --> 00:08:55,873
- How do we stop it?
- We?

193
00:08:55,874 --> 00:08:57,642
No, Korra.

194
00:08:57,643 --> 00:09:02,643
This is a war
only the Avatar can prevent.

195
00:09:05,184 --> 00:09:07,151
- I'm usually the one starting fights.

196
00:09:07,152 --> 00:09:09,020
I don't know how to stop them
from happening.

197
00:09:09,021 --> 00:09:11,623
- As the Avatar,
you must remain neutral

198
00:09:11,624 --> 00:09:12,991
in this conflict.

199
00:09:12,992 --> 00:09:15,126
You will naturally want
to help your people,

200
00:09:15,127 --> 00:09:19,497
but showing favoritism will not
help our tribes find unity.

201
00:09:19,498 --> 00:09:21,199
- Maybe Tenzin was right.

202
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,201
Maybe I'm not ready
to be the Avatar.

203
00:09:23,202 --> 00:09:25,136
- Tenzin lacked faith in you.

204
00:09:25,137 --> 00:09:27,272
But I have no doubt
you will become

205
00:09:27,273 --> 00:09:30,375
the most admired Avatar
the world has ever known.

206
00:09:30,376 --> 00:09:32,343
- Thank you, Uncle.

207
00:09:47,226 --> 00:09:48,326
- Who threw those?

208
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:56,501
You hoodlums think
you're tough, huh?

209
00:09:56,502 --> 00:09:58,503
- Pick on a Waterbender
your own size!

210
00:10:01,674 --> 00:10:04,309
- Stop!

211
00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:06,244
- Tell these thugs
to go back to the North.

212
00:10:06,245 --> 00:10:07,879
They're not welcome here anymore!

213
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:10,048
- These Southerners
need to stay in line.

214
00:10:10,049 --> 00:10:11,749
- Everyone, calm down.

215
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:13,284
You're all part of the same tribe.

216
00:10:13,285 --> 00:10:14,552
Start acting like it.

217
00:10:14,553 --> 00:10:16,220
- You're taking their side?

218
00:10:16,221 --> 00:10:17,889
We thought you were one of us.

219
00:10:17,890 --> 00:10:19,657
- I'm not taking anyone's side.

220
00:10:19,658 --> 00:10:20,792
Hey!

221
00:10:20,793 --> 00:10:25,793
- You're the worst Avatar ever!

222
00:10:25,864 --> 00:10:30,501
- Everyone, walk away from this.

223
00:10:30,502 --> 00:10:32,603
They're not worth our trouble.

224
00:10:32,604 --> 00:10:37,604
Go back to your homes.

225
00:10:45,417 --> 00:10:48,453
Korra, I--

226
00:10:48,454 --> 00:10:53,454
Korra!

227
00:10:55,561 --> 00:10:57,795
- Ikki!

228
00:10:57,796 --> 00:11:01,632
Ikki!

229
00:11:01,633 --> 00:11:04,402
Ikki?

230
00:11:04,403 --> 00:11:06,237
Ikki, where are you?

231
00:11:06,238 --> 00:11:09,073
Over here, Dad!

232
00:11:09,074 --> 00:11:11,642
Just kidding. It's me!

233
00:11:13,846 --> 00:11:15,413
- There's no sign of her anywhere.

234
00:11:15,414 --> 00:11:18,116
- Why would lkki run off like this?

235
00:11:18,117 --> 00:11:19,851
Ah, it's probably my fault.

236
00:11:19,852 --> 00:11:22,019
- Probably.
- Excuse me?

237
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:23,688
- I'm guessing you've been so busy

238
00:11:23,689 --> 00:11:25,490
with your "duty" to Republic City

239
00:11:25,491 --> 00:11:27,692
that you forgot about your duty
to your kids.

240
00:11:27,693 --> 00:11:29,727
Duty.

241
00:11:29,728 --> 00:11:31,863
- What are you, five years old?

242
00:11:31,864 --> 00:11:33,398
- Kya, you're right.

243
00:11:33,399 --> 00:11:35,299
I haven't been spending
enough time with them.

244
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:36,901
I wish I could be as good a father

245
00:11:36,902 --> 00:11:38,836
as Dad was to us.

246
00:11:38,837 --> 00:11:42,740
- Tenzin, your problem is
you're exactly like Dad.

247
00:11:42,741 --> 00:11:45,176
He was so focused on saving the world

248
00:11:45,177 --> 00:11:47,078
and doing his duty--
don't laugh--

249
00:11:47,079 --> 00:11:49,247
that he never had time for us.

250
00:11:49,248 --> 00:11:50,782
- Dad was under a lot of pressure.

251
00:11:50,783 --> 00:11:53,217
- He always had time
for you, though,

252
00:11:53,218 --> 00:11:55,753
his precious little Airbender.

253
00:11:55,754 --> 00:11:58,389
- Dad loved us all equally.

254
00:11:58,390 --> 00:12:01,192
Besides, it all happened
a long time ago.

255
00:12:01,193 --> 00:12:02,794
Why are we even talking
about this?

256
00:12:02,795 --> 00:12:05,830
- Because you seem to have
some grandiose delusion

257
00:12:05,831 --> 00:12:08,566
that we had a perfect,
happy-go-lucky childhood.

258
00:12:08,567 --> 00:12:10,301
Guess what.
We didn't.

259
00:12:10,302 --> 00:12:11,569
- We need to keep moving

260
00:12:11,570 --> 00:12:13,371
if we want to find lkki before dark.

261
00:12:13,372 --> 00:12:15,206
- See what he's doing there, Bumi?

262
00:12:15,207 --> 00:12:17,809
Classic Airbender technique.

263
00:12:17,810 --> 00:12:19,677
Cutting and running
when things get tough!

264
00:12:19,678 --> 00:12:20,778
- Ugh.

265
00:12:20,779 --> 00:12:22,079
- Yeah.
Did Dad teach you that move?

266
00:12:27,152 --> 00:12:28,886
- How was your day, sweetie?

267
00:12:28,887 --> 00:12:30,555
- Oh, fabulous.

268
00:12:30,556 --> 00:12:31,856
My tribe's about to go to war,

269
00:12:31,857 --> 00:12:33,224
and I'm supposed to stop it,

270
00:12:33,225 --> 00:12:34,926
but will anyone listen to me?

271
00:12:34,927 --> 00:12:37,628
No! And I didn't ask
for my father's help.

272
00:12:37,629 --> 00:12:39,864
Can't he just let me be the Avatar?

273
00:12:39,865 --> 00:12:42,300
- Uh, do you want advice,

274
00:12:42,301 --> 00:12:44,168
or am I just supposed to listen?

275
00:12:44,169 --> 00:12:45,770
I'm still not clear on that.

276
00:12:45,771 --> 00:12:48,873
- Ugh. I'm sorry.

277
00:12:48,874 --> 00:12:50,908
My dad just gets me all worked up.

278
00:12:50,909 --> 00:12:52,944
- How about you take a break
from all this Avatar stuff,

279
00:12:52,945 --> 00:12:54,979
and we go out for a quiet dinner?

280
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:56,247
Just the two of us.

281
00:13:02,588 --> 00:13:04,789
Isn't this fun, huh?

282
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:07,391
We never get to spend
enough time together,

283
00:13:07,392 --> 00:13:10,428
just the five of us.

284
00:13:10,429 --> 00:13:12,997
So fun.

285
00:13:12,998 --> 00:13:17,998
- Excuse us while we retrieve
more sustenance.

286
00:13:20,305 --> 00:13:21,772
- You guys gotta save me.

287
00:13:21,773 --> 00:13:23,841
- I thought you were
breaking up with her.

288
00:13:23,842 --> 00:13:25,610
What happened
to ripping off the leech?

289
00:13:25,611 --> 00:13:26,844
- I tried!

290
00:13:26,845 --> 00:13:28,079
But any time I bring up the subject,

291
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,747
she threatens to freeze me
in a block of ice

292
00:13:29,748 --> 00:13:32,283
and feed me to dolphin-piranhas!

293
00:13:32,284 --> 00:13:34,118
- So it was more like
you tugged at the leech.

294
00:13:34,119 --> 00:13:37,321
- Yes, over and over and over,
but it won't come off.

295
00:13:37,322 --> 00:13:39,223
Why didn't you warn me
your cousin had the power

296
00:13:39,224 --> 00:13:40,725
to reach into my heart
and crush my soul

297
00:13:40,726 --> 00:13:42,193
with her bare hands?

298
00:13:42,194 --> 00:13:44,795
- Uh, 'cause I thought
it was pretty obvious.

299
00:13:44,796 --> 00:13:45,997
- No, no,
not to me, it wasn't.

300
00:13:45,998 --> 00:13:47,431
I'm very bad at reading people.

301
00:13:47,432 --> 00:13:49,367
You should know that by now.

302
00:13:49,368 --> 00:13:51,736
Oh, man.

303
00:13:51,737 --> 00:13:53,104
Oh!

304
00:13:53,105 --> 00:13:55,806
Do something, Avatar!

305
00:13:55,807 --> 00:13:57,241
- You know, this reminds me

306
00:13:57,242 --> 00:13:58,576
of a search-and-rescue mission

307
00:13:58,577 --> 00:14:00,645
I commanded years ago

308
00:14:00,646 --> 00:14:03,214
in the mountains outside of Ba Sing Se.

309
00:14:03,215 --> 00:14:04,815
Here we go.

310
00:14:04,816 --> 00:14:08,586
- For five days, we scoured
that beast of a mountain,

311
00:14:08,587 --> 00:14:11,589
fighting our way
through blizzards, sandstorms,

312
00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:13,991
and three typhoons.

313
00:14:13,992 --> 00:14:15,927
Finally, we found the men
huddled in a cave,

314
00:14:15,928 --> 00:14:17,495
seconds from death.

315
00:14:17,496 --> 00:14:19,363
With no time to lose,

316
00:14:19,364 --> 00:14:22,833
I piled all 12 of those
poor souls on my back

317
00:14:22,834 --> 00:14:25,670
and single-handedly carried them

318
00:14:25,671 --> 00:14:27,672
down the mountain to safety.

319
00:14:27,673 --> 00:14:31,108
- And how exactly is that
supposed to help us find lkki?

320
00:14:31,109 --> 00:14:33,744
- It was supposed to inspire you.

321
00:14:33,745 --> 00:14:37,114
Clearly, you know nothing
about being a leader of men.

322
00:14:37,115 --> 00:14:39,951
That's probably why
the Avatar fired you.

323
00:14:39,952 --> 00:14:42,486
- I'm sick of your far-fetched tales.

324
00:14:42,487 --> 00:14:44,121
Three typhoons?

325
00:14:44,122 --> 00:14:46,757
- Well, I may have thrown in
an extra typhoon or two

326
00:14:46,758 --> 00:14:48,192
for dramatic effect, but--

327
00:14:48,193 --> 00:14:50,661
- Quit arguing and bring
that lantern over here.

328
00:14:50,662 --> 00:14:55,662
I found footprints!

329
00:14:56,301 --> 00:14:58,970
- Come on!
- No, follow me!

330
00:14:58,971 --> 00:15:03,507
This will get us down
50 times faster.

331
00:15:03,508 --> 00:15:06,043
- Bumi, it's pitch black,
and the rocks are slippery.

332
00:15:06,044 --> 00:15:07,144
You're gonna hurt yourself.

333
00:15:07,145 --> 00:15:09,213
- Come on, you wimps!

334
00:15:09,214 --> 00:15:11,449
If I can do it,
it should be no problem

335
00:15:11,450 --> 00:15:12,917
for a couple of benders.

336
00:15:12,918 --> 00:15:14,919
- Fine.

337
00:15:26,565 --> 00:15:29,934
- You were right, Bumi!
That was faster!

338
00:15:29,935 --> 00:15:33,037
- At least 50 times faster,
by my calculations.

339
00:15:35,073 --> 00:15:38,142
- Oh, Tenzin's
the funny guy now.

340
00:15:38,143 --> 00:15:40,978
- If you need an airlift down,
just say the word.

341
00:15:40,979 --> 00:15:42,713
- Bah, I don't need your help.

342
00:15:42,714 --> 00:15:44,382
I've got everything under control.

343
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:48,386
Agh!

344
00:15:48,387 --> 00:15:53,387
- Bumi!

345
00:15:56,928 --> 00:15:58,796
- Did Dad send you to talk to me?

346
00:15:58,797 --> 00:16:00,598
- Your father doesn't know I'm here.

347
00:16:00,599 --> 00:16:02,933
Korra, what's going on
between you two?

348
00:16:02,934 --> 00:16:04,402
- Ask Dad.

349
00:16:04,403 --> 00:16:07,104
- I've tried,
but he won't talk about it.

350
00:16:07,105 --> 00:16:09,740
Honey, it breaks my heart
to see our family

351
00:16:09,741 --> 00:16:11,409
being torn apart like this.

352
00:16:11,410 --> 00:16:13,711
- You want to know
what's been going on?

353
00:16:13,712 --> 00:16:15,746
I found out Dad's been lying to me

354
00:16:15,747 --> 00:16:17,615
my whole life.

355
00:16:17,616 --> 00:16:19,050
Unalaq told me everything--

356
00:16:19,051 --> 00:16:21,318
how Dad and Tenzin
kept me trapped down here

357
00:16:21,319 --> 00:16:22,620
while I trained,

358
00:16:22,621 --> 00:16:26,023
how Dad got banished from the North.

359
00:16:26,024 --> 00:16:28,225
- So the truth is out.

360
00:16:28,226 --> 00:16:29,994
- You knew.

361
00:16:29,995 --> 00:16:31,729
And you never said anything.

362
00:16:31,730 --> 00:16:34,265
- We were trying to keep
our family together,

363
00:16:34,266 --> 00:16:36,000
to give you a normal childhood.

364
00:16:36,001 --> 00:16:39,003
- I never wanted a normal childhood.

365
00:16:39,004 --> 00:16:41,772
All I ever wanted to be
was the Avatar,

366
00:16:41,773 --> 00:16:43,240
but everyone keeps
holding me back,

367
00:16:43,241 --> 00:16:44,475
even my own parents!

368
00:16:44,476 --> 00:16:46,644
Unalaq's the only one
who believes in me.

369
00:16:46,645 --> 00:16:48,212
- That's not true, Korra.

370
00:16:48,213 --> 00:16:50,314
- No? Then why is everyone
in the South

371
00:16:50,315 --> 00:16:51,949
turning against me,
when all I'm trying to do

372
00:16:51,950 --> 00:16:53,117
is help them?

373
00:16:53,118 --> 00:16:54,919
- The problems between the North
and the South

374
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:57,088
started long before you were born.

375
00:16:57,089 --> 00:16:59,457
You can't expect to undo them in a day.

376
00:16:59,458 --> 00:17:01,025
- So I should just sit back

377
00:17:01,026 --> 00:17:03,027
and let the Water Tribes go to war?

378
00:17:03,028 --> 00:17:06,564
- No, but this situation
might be out of your control.

379
00:17:06,565 --> 00:17:09,533
Varrick's been plotting
a rebellion against Unalaq.

380
00:17:09,534 --> 00:17:11,469
He asked your father to join, and--

381
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:13,104
- Dad is part of a rebellion?

382
00:17:13,105 --> 00:17:14,739
- I don't know,
but I don't want you

383
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:16,040
getting caught in the middle of it.

384
00:17:16,041 --> 00:17:17,475
- It's too late, Mom.

385
00:17:17,476 --> 00:17:22,476
I'm already in the middle of it.

386
00:17:23,281 --> 00:17:28,281
- Korra!

387
00:17:30,655 --> 00:17:33,157
- Uncle!

388
00:17:33,158 --> 00:17:35,326
Oh, no.

389
00:17:35,327 --> 00:17:36,494
Uncle?

390
00:17:46,071 --> 00:17:51,071
Dad?

391
00:17:52,077 --> 00:17:55,045
- Dad, don't do this.

392
00:17:55,046 --> 00:17:56,747
- Turn around, Avatar,

393
00:17:56,748 --> 00:17:58,249
and pretend you didn't see anything.

394
00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:01,252
- No. Leave Unalaq and go.

395
00:18:01,253 --> 00:18:03,354
I'll tell him I tried
to stop you, but you escaped.

396
00:18:03,355 --> 00:18:05,022
We can still avoid a war.

397
00:18:05,023 --> 00:18:08,225
- No, we can't.

398
00:18:22,641 --> 00:18:25,810
- Get him out of here!

399
00:18:27,179 --> 00:18:28,946
We're all part of the same tribe.

400
00:18:28,947 --> 00:18:33,947
I don't want to hurt you.

401
00:19:03,348 --> 00:19:08,348
- Dad, stop!

402
00:19:14,993 --> 00:19:17,461
- Why did you do this, Dad?

403
00:19:20,699 --> 00:19:23,968
What? Who are you?
Where's my father?

404
00:19:23,969 --> 00:19:25,569
- He wouldn't help us.

405
00:19:25,570 --> 00:19:30,207
He's a traitor, just like you.

406
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:37,147
Thank you for saving my life.

407
00:19:37,148 --> 00:19:39,984
- I'm just glad I got here in time.

408
00:19:39,985 --> 00:19:41,652
- Find Varrick.

409
00:19:41,653 --> 00:19:46,653
I want him to freeze in prison
with the rest of these traitors.

410
00:19:47,125 --> 00:19:48,893
- Wait, you can't just lock them away.

411
00:19:48,894 --> 00:19:50,661
That will only make the South angrier.

412
00:19:50,662 --> 00:19:52,529
- You want them to go free?

413
00:19:52,530 --> 00:19:53,964
- No,

414
00:19:53,965 --> 00:19:57,034
but let them stand trial
for what they did.

415
00:19:57,035 --> 00:20:01,572
Every Water Tribe citizen
deserves that right.

416
00:20:01,573 --> 00:20:03,107
- Very well.

417
00:20:03,108 --> 00:20:05,809
I will respect the Avatar's
wishes in this matter.

418
00:20:05,810 --> 00:20:08,545
- Thank you, Uncle.

419
00:20:08,546 --> 00:20:10,381
- I told you those rocks were slippery.

420
00:20:10,382 --> 00:20:12,082
You're lucky you didn't kill yourself.

421
00:20:12,083 --> 00:20:13,884
- You done with the lecture, Mom?

422
00:20:13,885 --> 00:20:16,020
- Oh, grow up.

423
00:20:16,021 --> 00:20:18,589
You haven't changed one bit
since we were kids.

424
00:20:18,590 --> 00:20:19,857
You're still trying to prove

425
00:20:19,858 --> 00:20:21,525
you can do everything a bender can.

426
00:20:21,526 --> 00:20:23,594
Well, you can't.
Deal with it.

427
00:20:23,595 --> 00:20:25,562
- And you're not our mother.

428
00:20:25,563 --> 00:20:28,933
You don't get to tell me
what I can and can't do.

429
00:20:28,934 --> 00:20:30,834
Deal with that. Ugh!

430
00:20:30,835 --> 00:20:32,403
- Good luck healing yourself

431
00:20:32,404 --> 00:20:34,471
with your special
non-bending powers.

432
00:20:34,472 --> 00:20:36,373
- Hey, back me up here, Tenzin.

433
00:20:36,374 --> 00:20:38,008
- Kya's right.

434
00:20:38,009 --> 00:20:39,310
You're the oldest of us,

435
00:20:39,311 --> 00:20:41,178
but you always acted like the youngest.

436
00:20:41,179 --> 00:20:43,380
I had to become the responsible one.

437
00:20:43,381 --> 00:20:46,884
- You think you're
the responsible one?

438
00:20:46,885 --> 00:20:49,553
Where were you after Dad died
and Mom was all alone?

439
00:20:49,554 --> 00:20:52,289
Because I was the only one
who packed up and moved

440
00:20:52,290 --> 00:20:54,158
my whole life to be with her.

441
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:56,093
- Sure, after years
of flitting around the world,

442
00:20:56,094 --> 00:20:58,329
trying to find yourself.

443
00:20:58,330 --> 00:21:00,631
It was time for you
to settle down somewhere.

444
00:21:00,632 --> 00:21:03,100
You two have no idea
how it feels to have the future

445
00:21:03,101 --> 00:21:05,369
of an entire culture on your shoulders.

446
00:21:05,370 --> 00:21:06,603
- Oh, boo-hoo.

447
00:21:06,604 --> 00:21:08,272
Must've been real hard for you,

448
00:21:08,273 --> 00:21:09,740
flying around the world with Dad,

449
00:21:09,741 --> 00:21:11,442
riding elephant-koi all day.

450
00:21:11,443 --> 00:21:13,844
- Oh, so that's what this
is all about.

451
00:21:13,845 --> 00:21:16,246
- That's what
it's always been about.

452
00:21:16,247 --> 00:21:18,048
You think you're some savior

453
00:21:18,049 --> 00:21:20,351
who has to carry on Dad's legacy.

454
00:21:20,352 --> 00:21:21,719
- Who else is going to do it?

455
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:23,120
- How about all of us?

456
00:21:23,121 --> 00:21:25,656
- Yeah, we're Aang's kids too.

457
00:21:25,657 --> 00:21:27,825
- We never should have come
on this vacation.

458
00:21:27,826 --> 00:21:29,793
- I couldn't agree more.

459
00:21:29,794 --> 00:21:32,096
- Well, I didn't want you
to come in the first place.

460
00:21:32,097 --> 00:21:34,365
I can't be around you two right now.

461
00:21:34,366 --> 00:21:36,734
Go back to the temple
and see if lkki returned.

462
00:21:36,735 --> 00:21:37,901
I'll keep looking out here.

463
00:21:37,902 --> 00:21:39,336
- Fine.
- Fine.

464
00:21:39,337 --> 00:21:42,439
- Fine.

465
00:21:56,821 --> 00:21:58,489
- Is it okay if I come in?

466
00:21:58,490 --> 00:22:00,824
- Of course.
We heard what happened.

467
00:22:00,825 --> 00:22:02,593
Are you okay?

468
00:22:07,599 --> 00:22:09,566
- I'm so glad you weren't there.

469
00:22:09,567 --> 00:22:10,901
I don't know what I would have done.

470
00:22:10,902 --> 00:22:15,272
- I had no idea how far
Varrick was willing to go.

471
00:22:15,273 --> 00:22:16,907
My brother and I
have our differences,

472
00:22:16,908 --> 00:22:18,809
but I would never attack him.

473
00:22:18,810 --> 00:22:20,878
- I'm sorry for thinking
you had anything to do

474
00:22:20,879 --> 00:22:22,146
with the rebels,

475
00:22:22,147 --> 00:22:24,381
and for all the pain
I've caused you and Mom.

476
00:22:24,382 --> 00:22:26,216
- I'm the one who should apologize.

477
00:22:26,217 --> 00:22:28,152
After I saw the southern lights return,

478
00:22:28,153 --> 00:22:29,820
I was so proud of you.

479
00:22:29,821 --> 00:22:32,823
I never should have held you back.

480
00:22:32,824 --> 00:22:34,825
- When your father and I
found each other,

481
00:22:34,826 --> 00:22:36,727
all we wanted was
to live a simple life

482
00:22:36,728 --> 00:22:38,729
and raise a family.

483
00:22:38,730 --> 00:22:41,265
But then we discovered
you were the Avatar,

484
00:22:41,266 --> 00:22:43,133
and simple was over.

485
00:22:43,134 --> 00:22:45,536
We knew one day
the world would need you,

486
00:22:45,537 --> 00:22:47,304
and you wouldn't need us
anymore.

487
00:22:47,305 --> 00:22:52,305
- Mom, Dad,
of course I still need you.

488
00:22:55,046 --> 00:22:56,313
- We weren't expecting you.

489
00:22:56,314 --> 00:22:59,016
- Tonraq, Senna,
you are under arrest

490
00:22:59,017 --> 00:23:00,150
and will stand trial.

491
00:23:00,151 --> 00:23:01,985
- Trial? For what?

492
00:23:01,986 --> 00:23:04,321
- For conspiring to assassinate me.
