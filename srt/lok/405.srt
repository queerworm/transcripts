1
00:00:06,813 --> 00:00:08,213
Earth.

2
00:00:08,215 --> 00:00:09,748
Fire.

3
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:11,516
Air.

4
00:00:11,518 --> 00:00:12,818
Water.

5
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:17,055
Only the Avatar can
master all four elements

6
00:00:17,057 --> 00:00:20,259
and bring balance to the world.

7
00:00:26,096 --> 00:00:28,263
After three years, Kuvira has united

8
00:00:28,265 --> 00:00:29,505
the former Earth Kingdom states

9
00:00:29,529 --> 00:00:31,734
under her new Earth empire banner.

10
00:00:31,736 --> 00:00:33,836
But one holdout remains: Zaofu.

11
00:00:33,838 --> 00:00:34,838
During that same time,

12
00:00:34,839 --> 00:00:36,839
Asami rebuilt the
company her father created

13
00:00:36,841 --> 00:00:38,907
and helped redesign the
city's infrastructure.

14
00:00:38,909 --> 00:00:41,410
And most recently, the
airbender kids found the Avatar.

15
00:00:41,412 --> 00:00:44,380
Korra rid herself of the
residual poison in her body

16
00:00:44,382 --> 00:00:47,716
and is ready to return to action.

17
00:01:09,339 --> 00:01:11,707
We have an emergency.

18
00:01:15,445 --> 00:01:17,112
I'll contact President Raiko.

19
00:01:17,114 --> 00:01:20,249
He'll send the united forces.

20
00:01:21,384 --> 00:01:24,420
Call whomever you want, but
they'll never make it in time.

21
00:01:24,422 --> 00:01:29,391
Kuvira's already here, and
she brought her entire army.

22
00:01:39,903 --> 00:01:40,869
By this time tomorrow,

23
00:01:40,871 --> 00:01:42,351
my mother will have signed our treaty,

24
00:01:42,375 --> 00:01:45,174
and the Earth empire
will finally be united.

25
00:01:45,176 --> 00:01:46,408
Don't get ahead of yourself.

26
00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:50,345
Securing your hometown won't
be like every other city.

27
00:01:50,347 --> 00:01:54,049
Zaofu stopped being my home long ago.

28
00:01:54,051 --> 00:01:56,385
I'm ready to take it by force.

29
00:01:56,387 --> 00:01:57,119
No.

30
00:01:57,121 --> 00:01:59,288
The eyes of the world are on us now.

31
00:01:59,290 --> 00:02:01,356
We must do this right.

32
00:02:01,358 --> 00:02:02,458
That's why we need Bolin.

33
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:05,961
Do you really think we can rely on him?

34
00:02:05,963 --> 00:02:07,396
Su trusts him.

35
00:02:07,398 --> 00:02:09,231
She'll listen to him.

36
00:02:09,233 --> 00:02:12,468
Are you sure we should be going to Zaofu?

37
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:15,237
Dad wanted us to bring
you back to Republic City.

38
00:02:15,239 --> 00:02:17,973
If Kuvira's heading to Zaofu, so am I.

39
00:02:17,975 --> 00:02:20,776
She needs to know that the Avatar is back.

40
00:02:20,778 --> 00:02:22,211
The world needs to know.

41
00:02:22,213 --> 00:02:23,846
Whoo-hoo!

42
00:02:23,848 --> 00:02:25,147
Avatar fight!

43
00:02:25,149 --> 00:02:28,016
This is going to be awesome!

44
00:02:28,018 --> 00:02:30,452
Meelo, there's not gonna be a fight.

45
00:02:30,454 --> 00:02:31,887
Kuvira saved my dad.

46
00:02:31,889 --> 00:02:33,169
She was a Captain in Su's guard.

47
00:02:33,193 --> 00:02:35,190
I think she can be reasoned with.

48
00:02:35,192 --> 00:02:36,925
What? No fight?

49
00:02:36,927 --> 00:02:40,028
Why did we go through all
that trouble to save you

50
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:44,233
if you're not going to beat someone up?

51
00:02:47,237 --> 00:02:49,471
Zhu Li, is this thing on?

52
00:02:49,473 --> 00:02:50,672
We're rolling, sir.

53
00:02:50,674 --> 00:02:53,976
Okay, I'm Varrick of Varrick
industries international,

54
00:02:53,978 --> 00:02:58,280
and this is spirit vine experiment 3-02

55
00:02:58,282 --> 00:03:00,415
hand me the thing.

56
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:07,956
In this stasis capsule is a
preserved spirit vine sample

57
00:03:07,958 --> 00:03:12,127
weighing approximately two Zhu Lis.

58
00:03:12,462 --> 00:03:15,597
I have postulated that these spirit vines

59
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:18,267
are a form of pure energy that's unstable

60
00:03:18,269 --> 00:03:21,069
in what we call "typical Earth conditions."

61
00:03:21,071 --> 00:03:24,139
This machine should transfer
the energy from the vine

62
00:03:24,141 --> 00:03:27,142
into a battery using electrical currents,

63
00:03:27,144 --> 00:03:28,410
reverse magnetic polarity,

64
00:03:28,412 --> 00:03:34,950
and a little-known phenomenon
I call the Varri-effect.

65
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:38,153
It's working.

66
00:03:38,155 --> 00:03:41,390
It's registering five Varricks of power...

67
00:03:41,392 --> 00:03:46,028
Now seven Varricks.

68
00:03:46,696 --> 00:03:50,065
Whoa. What is this?

69
00:03:50,067 --> 00:03:53,035
What's going on?

70
00:03:53,037 --> 00:03:54,303
Oh!

71
00:03:54,305 --> 00:03:55,237
Ahh!

72
00:03:55,239 --> 00:03:57,072
Zhu Li, shut it down.

73
00:03:57,074 --> 00:03:59,541
There are too many Varricks.

74
00:04:09,185 --> 00:04:11,053
Ahh!

75
00:04:11,055 --> 00:04:13,555
Ahh!

76
00:04:13,557 --> 00:04:16,325
Sir...

77
00:04:18,462 --> 00:04:19,361
You're too heavy.

78
00:04:19,363 --> 00:04:23,031
You know, you could stand
to lose a few Zhu Lis.

79
00:04:23,033 --> 00:04:25,067
I think you're just weak, sir.

80
00:04:25,069 --> 00:04:26,602
Pull harder.

81
00:04:29,039 --> 00:04:32,341
Ahh!

82
00:04:33,643 --> 00:04:37,045
Varrick, you saved me.

83
00:04:37,047 --> 00:04:38,480
Of course I saved you.

84
00:04:38,482 --> 00:04:41,984
I can't clean this place up by myself.

85
00:04:41,986 --> 00:04:42,684
Grab a broom.

86
00:04:42,686 --> 00:04:44,653
What happened? Were we attacked?

87
00:04:44,655 --> 00:04:48,357
No, we were spirit-vined, but don't worry.

88
00:04:48,359 --> 00:04:51,259
I'm putting the kibosh on this project.

89
00:04:51,261 --> 00:04:52,094
No, you're not.

90
00:04:52,096 --> 00:04:55,297
Do you realize what we can
do with this kind of power?

91
00:04:55,299 --> 00:04:56,299
Yes, I do.

92
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:58,200
And that's why we've
got to put an end to it.

93
00:04:58,202 --> 00:04:59,935
What if it fell into the wrong hands?

94
00:04:59,937 --> 00:05:02,237
Since when does that matter to you?

95
00:05:02,239 --> 00:05:03,639
I know. It's not like me, right?

96
00:05:03,641 --> 00:05:05,161
Usually, I look at a project like this,

97
00:05:05,185 --> 00:05:08,610
and all I think is, "wow, I can
make a ton of money off this."

98
00:05:08,612 --> 00:05:13,649
But recently, I've been having
these strange feelings inside.

99
00:05:13,651 --> 00:05:16,752
It's like I'm... concerned with others.

100
00:05:16,754 --> 00:05:19,154
And there's this nagging voice in my head

101
00:05:19,156 --> 00:05:22,357
constantly telling me
what's right from wrong.

102
00:05:22,359 --> 00:05:25,260
I believe that voice
is your conscience, sir.

103
00:05:25,262 --> 00:05:26,862
Well, I'm the other voice in your head,

104
00:05:26,886 --> 00:05:30,599
and I'm telling you, you
will continue this project.

105
00:05:30,601 --> 00:05:31,400
Sorry, no.

106
00:05:31,402 --> 00:05:33,298
I just really got to stand
my ground on this one.

107
00:05:33,322 --> 00:05:34,054
Whoa!

108
00:05:34,056 --> 00:05:36,223
Now there's a voice in my head telling me

109
00:05:36,225 --> 00:05:37,924
to drop you on the tracks.

110
00:05:37,926 --> 00:05:40,160
Should I listen?

111
00:05:40,162 --> 00:05:41,028
No, no.

112
00:05:41,030 --> 00:05:43,897
Head voices are liars.
What do head voices know?

113
00:05:43,899 --> 00:05:45,198
I'll work on the project.

114
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:47,801
Please don't drop me.

115
00:05:47,803 --> 00:05:51,004
Ahh!

116
00:06:04,052 --> 00:06:06,887
Asami, you came.

117
00:06:10,091 --> 00:06:12,859
I'm here to return these.

118
00:06:12,861 --> 00:06:14,661
You never opened them.

119
00:06:14,663 --> 00:06:15,729
Stop writing me.

120
00:06:15,731 --> 00:06:19,866
I never want to see or hear from you again.

121
00:06:19,868 --> 00:06:21,268
Please, just let me say one thing,

122
00:06:21,292 --> 00:06:24,304
then I'll never contact you again.

123
00:06:24,306 --> 00:06:28,742
I can't forgive myself for all
the horrible things I've done,

124
00:06:28,744 --> 00:06:30,711
and I never expect you to forgive me.

125
00:06:30,713 --> 00:06:34,815
I tore our family apart
and destroyed our good name.

126
00:06:34,817 --> 00:06:35,849
But in a life of regret,

127
00:06:35,851 --> 00:06:41,655
you're the one thing I look
back on that makes me smile.

128
00:06:41,923 --> 00:06:45,892
I just want you to know
I'm so proud of you, Asami.

129
00:06:45,894 --> 00:06:51,598
You are the greatest thing I ever created.

130
00:07:01,876 --> 00:07:03,276
Am I in trouble?

131
00:07:03,278 --> 00:07:06,079
No. In fact, I have good news.

132
00:07:06,081 --> 00:07:09,282
We want you to be part of our inner circle.

133
00:07:09,284 --> 00:07:11,318
Inner circle! No way! Yes!

134
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:15,021
Ahem, that is a great honor.

135
00:07:15,023 --> 00:07:16,156
What does it mean, exactly?

136
00:07:16,158 --> 00:07:18,058
It means you've proven your worth.

137
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:20,127
We're so close to uniting the empire,

138
00:07:20,129 --> 00:07:23,163
but Su has some resentment
towards me and Baatar

139
00:07:23,165 --> 00:07:24,464
that might cloud her judgment

140
00:07:24,466 --> 00:07:27,234
and stop her from making a wise decision.

141
00:07:27,236 --> 00:07:29,903
We believe you can help her see clearly.

142
00:07:29,905 --> 00:07:31,004
I can do that.

143
00:07:31,006 --> 00:07:32,406
By the time I'm finished telling her

144
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:35,275
all the great things we've
done, she'll be begging to join.

145
00:07:35,277 --> 00:07:37,844
Good, because we're here.

146
00:07:39,347 --> 00:07:42,315
Aren't all these troops
gonna send the wrong message?

147
00:07:42,317 --> 00:07:44,551
The army is here to project strength.

148
00:07:44,553 --> 00:07:47,954
You're here to present peace.

149
00:07:58,399 --> 00:08:00,167
Opal, you're here too.

150
00:08:00,169 --> 00:08:02,636
No, you've chosen your side.

151
00:08:02,638 --> 00:08:05,005
Sides? There shouldn't be sides.

152
00:08:05,007 --> 00:08:08,041
I know, why don't we all
stand in a circle, huh,

153
00:08:08,043 --> 00:08:09,075
maybe hold hands?

154
00:08:09,077 --> 00:08:10,210
I'm not giving up Zaofu.

155
00:08:10,212 --> 00:08:12,579
I don't care if you
brought your entire army.

156
00:08:12,581 --> 00:08:15,282
Su, I didn't bring my army to threaten you.

157
00:08:15,284 --> 00:08:17,484
I wanted to show you
all that your son and I

158
00:08:17,486 --> 00:08:18,518
have accomplished.

159
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:20,020
You must realize what you're doing

160
00:08:20,022 --> 00:08:23,757
goes against everything your
father and I tried to teach you.

161
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:26,259
Son, you belong here.

162
00:08:26,261 --> 00:08:26,893
Why?

163
00:08:26,895 --> 00:08:29,563
So that I can go on living in your shadow?

164
00:08:29,565 --> 00:08:30,964
Don't say that.

165
00:08:30,966 --> 00:08:33,166
Can't you see she's brainwashed you.

166
00:08:33,168 --> 00:08:35,969
Ha, I didn't brainwash him.

167
00:08:35,971 --> 00:08:37,003
I set him free.

168
00:08:37,005 --> 00:08:38,505
And now he's accomplished more with me

169
00:08:38,507 --> 00:08:39,973
than he ever could have with you.

170
00:08:39,975 --> 00:08:44,211
Okay, guys, obviously,
there's a lot of personal,

171
00:08:44,213 --> 00:08:45,178
painful history here.

172
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:48,148
So what do say we just all
forget about that stuff, huh?

173
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:49,516
I mean, that's the past.

174
00:08:49,518 --> 00:08:50,951
Right, Wing? Right, Wei?

175
00:08:50,953 --> 00:08:53,153
You guys know what I'm talking about.

176
00:08:53,155 --> 00:08:55,722
High five.

177
00:08:55,724 --> 00:08:57,424
All right. No, it's cool.

178
00:08:57,426 --> 00:08:59,259
You know what I think we need to do?

179
00:08:59,261 --> 00:09:00,427
Focus on the future.

180
00:09:00,429 --> 00:09:02,462
And the future is bright. Let me tell you.

181
00:09:02,464 --> 00:09:05,131
I've seen it. Yeah, saw it last month.

182
00:09:05,133 --> 00:09:07,300
We went to this town that had nothing.

183
00:09:07,302 --> 00:09:09,503
Most of the people
there had never even seen

184
00:09:09,505 --> 00:09:10,904
a satomobile before.

185
00:09:10,906 --> 00:09:14,140
But now they have two satomobiles,

186
00:09:14,142 --> 00:09:16,009
running water, and a magnet train

187
00:09:16,011 --> 00:09:17,544
that goes right through their town.

188
00:09:17,546 --> 00:09:19,246
I mean, how awesome is that?

189
00:09:19,248 --> 00:09:21,648
They might have been happy
when you first arrived,

190
00:09:21,650 --> 00:09:23,483
but I've seen what happens after you leave.

191
00:09:23,485 --> 00:09:26,319
Citizens are forced to work as slave labor.

192
00:09:26,321 --> 00:09:28,955
Dissenters are sent off to who knows where.

193
00:09:28,957 --> 00:09:30,090
You're wrong, Opal.

194
00:09:30,092 --> 00:09:31,958
Now, I don't know what
you think you've seen,

195
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:34,294
but I'm giving you the 100% Bolin guarantee

196
00:09:34,296 --> 00:09:35,962
that we're making the Earth Empire

197
00:09:35,964 --> 00:09:37,063
a better place to live.

198
00:09:37,065 --> 00:09:40,100
I can't believe you brought Bolin here

199
00:09:40,102 --> 00:09:42,102
to try to sway us.

200
00:09:42,104 --> 00:09:42,602
Leave.

201
00:09:42,604 --> 00:09:45,405
Zaofu will never accept
you as their leader.

202
00:09:45,407 --> 00:09:46,940
Then you leave me no choice.

203
00:09:46,942 --> 00:09:50,410
You have 24 hours to
agree to join the empire,

204
00:09:50,412 --> 00:09:53,980
or we take the city by force.

205
00:10:00,321 --> 00:10:02,989
I see it. Zaofu.

206
00:10:02,991 --> 00:10:04,391
We made it.

207
00:10:04,393 --> 00:10:10,030
And a bunch of other people are here too.

208
00:10:10,032 --> 00:10:11,064
Oh, no.

209
00:10:11,066 --> 00:10:13,500
I hope we're not too late.

210
00:10:16,370 --> 00:10:17,137
Korra?

211
00:10:17,139 --> 00:10:19,539
I can't believe it. Where have you been?

212
00:10:19,541 --> 00:10:22,008
You disappeared. Everyone was so worried.

213
00:10:22,010 --> 00:10:23,710
I'll tell you the whole story later.

214
00:10:23,712 --> 00:10:27,080
Right now, I want to help you stop Kuvira.

215
00:10:27,082 --> 00:10:29,349
What can I do?

216
00:10:29,351 --> 00:10:30,631
You were just bluffing, right?

217
00:10:30,655 --> 00:10:33,486
I mean, you're not really going
to attack Zaofu... Are you?

218
00:10:33,488 --> 00:10:36,723
When people don't cooperate,
we must find other ways

219
00:10:36,725 --> 00:10:38,525
of convincing them to join.

220
00:10:38,527 --> 00:10:39,726
Other ways?

221
00:10:39,728 --> 00:10:42,662
How many times have we
used these other ways

222
00:10:42,664 --> 00:10:43,496
in the past?

223
00:10:43,498 --> 00:10:45,365
It's not for you to worry about.

224
00:10:45,367 --> 00:10:47,500
So... What does happen

225
00:10:47,502 --> 00:10:50,403
to all of those towns and
villages after we leave?

226
00:10:50,405 --> 00:10:53,406
I just realized I've never really gone back

227
00:10:53,408 --> 00:10:54,441
and checked on them.

228
00:10:54,443 --> 00:10:56,376
Those people are my loyal subjects,

229
00:10:56,378 --> 00:10:59,579
and they contribute to the
empire however I see fit.

230
00:10:59,581 --> 00:11:01,214
Now that you're in the inner circle,

231
00:11:01,216 --> 00:11:03,550
you're going to have to
accept some hard truths.

232
00:11:03,552 --> 00:11:07,454
Maybe I'm not really an
inner-circle kind of guy.

233
00:11:07,456 --> 00:11:10,323
Or... or maybe we don't take over Zaofu.

234
00:11:10,325 --> 00:11:11,958
We could just let them be on their own,

235
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,727
then yay, the empire's united.

236
00:11:13,729 --> 00:11:15,228
Congratulations to us.

237
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:17,497
I didn't know your
personal feelings for Opal

238
00:11:17,499 --> 00:11:20,266
were stronger than your loyalty to me.

239
00:11:20,268 --> 00:11:22,235
Zaofu will join us.

240
00:11:22,237 --> 00:11:24,137
The only thing I'm second-guessing

241
00:11:24,139 --> 00:11:25,705
is the decision to bring you along.

242
00:11:25,707 --> 00:11:29,676
Maybe you need to spend some
time in a reeducation camp.

243
00:11:29,678 --> 00:11:32,245
I thought that's where we send people

244
00:11:32,247 --> 00:11:34,280
to learn new trade skills.

245
00:11:34,282 --> 00:11:36,149
Hard truths, Bolin.

246
00:11:36,151 --> 00:11:38,952
Your loyalty seems to be wavering.

247
00:11:38,954 --> 00:11:42,789
No, no, I'm totally on your side,

248
00:11:42,791 --> 00:11:46,993
completely 100% loyal.

249
00:11:49,797 --> 00:11:53,400
How did things get so bad
between you and Kuvira?

250
00:11:53,402 --> 00:11:55,168
I thought she was your protege?

251
00:11:55,170 --> 00:11:56,703
She was more than that.

252
00:11:56,705 --> 00:11:58,204
She was like a daughter to me.

253
00:11:58,206 --> 00:12:00,640
I took her in when she was eight years old

254
00:12:00,642 --> 00:12:01,875
and nourished her talents.

255
00:12:01,877 --> 00:12:04,744
Kuvira was smart, a natural leader,

256
00:12:04,746 --> 00:12:07,313
and quickly rose through the ranks.

257
00:12:07,315 --> 00:12:09,449
I saw myself in her.

258
00:12:09,451 --> 00:12:10,583
What happened?

259
00:12:10,585 --> 00:12:14,154
Three years ago, after the
fall of the Earth Queen,

260
00:12:14,156 --> 00:12:17,557
Raiko and Tenzin came to see me.

261
00:12:17,559 --> 00:12:18,839
The Earth kingdom is in chaos.

262
00:12:18,863 --> 00:12:21,361
There's a vacuum of power,
and I'm concerned about

263
00:12:21,363 --> 00:12:24,264
what will happen if
someone doesn't take control

264
00:12:24,266 --> 00:12:25,098
of the situation.

265
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:26,633
And do you think I should be the one?

266
00:12:26,635 --> 00:12:28,902
You're the perfect person to take charge.

267
00:12:28,904 --> 00:12:31,538
The world leaders trust
you, and as a Beifong,

268
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:33,540
you have credibility in the Earth kingdom.

269
00:12:33,542 --> 00:12:35,241
I'm honored that you thought of me,

270
00:12:35,243 --> 00:12:38,278
but I'm not interested
in imposing my ideals

271
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:39,946
on an entire nation.

272
00:12:39,948 --> 00:12:41,715
I'm afraid I can't help you.

273
00:12:41,717 --> 00:12:44,317
Suyin, I know this isn't my place,

274
00:12:44,319 --> 00:12:45,819
but I think you should do this.

275
00:12:45,821 --> 00:12:48,221
Zaofu has always been a
beacon of modern progress,

276
00:12:48,223 --> 00:12:50,724
and now you can share that with everyone.

277
00:12:50,726 --> 00:12:52,358
What would you have me do,

278
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:54,661
march into Ba sing Se with an army?

279
00:12:54,663 --> 00:12:56,129
We'd be seen as conquerors

280
00:12:56,131 --> 00:12:58,198
and greeted with nothing but war.

281
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,365
There are already wars.

282
00:12:59,367 --> 00:13:01,768
The Earth Queen nearly
destroyed our nation.

283
00:13:01,770 --> 00:13:04,804
This is our opportunity to change things.

284
00:13:04,806 --> 00:13:08,108
It's not going to happen.

285
00:13:08,509 --> 00:13:10,210
I didn't realize at the time,

286
00:13:10,212 --> 00:13:15,215
but that moment created a rift between us.

287
00:13:15,217 --> 00:13:17,584
Kuvira turned my own son against me.

288
00:13:17,586 --> 00:13:21,488
And together they plotted behind my back.

289
00:13:21,490 --> 00:13:23,123
What do you think you're doing?

290
00:13:23,125 --> 00:13:25,625
We're doing what you
don't have the guts to do.

291
00:13:25,627 --> 00:13:28,461
We're going to Ba Sing Se
to help bring order back

292
00:13:28,463 --> 00:13:29,529
to the Earth Kingdom.

293
00:13:29,531 --> 00:13:31,865
No. You will stay here.

294
00:13:31,867 --> 00:13:33,700
And who's going to stop me?

295
00:13:33,702 --> 00:13:36,369
Your security force was more than happy

296
00:13:36,371 --> 00:13:37,170
to join my cause.

297
00:13:37,172 --> 00:13:39,305
They're some of the best
fighters in the world,

298
00:13:39,307 --> 00:13:40,840
and they are tired of being treated

299
00:13:40,842 --> 00:13:42,442
like exotic birds in your cage.

300
00:13:42,444 --> 00:13:45,879
If you leave now, you will
never be welcomed back.

301
00:13:45,881 --> 00:13:49,949
When I choose to return,
it will be on my own terms.

302
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:53,253
Kuvira and Baatar left
that day with Varrick,

303
00:13:53,255 --> 00:13:56,856
my security force, and a few
of Zaofu's wealthiest citizens.

304
00:13:56,858 --> 00:14:00,894
After Kuvira proved herself
by stabilizing Ba Sing Se,

305
00:14:00,896 --> 00:14:02,962
Raiko and the other world leaders made her

306
00:14:02,964 --> 00:14:05,865
the provisional head of the Earth Kingdom.

307
00:14:05,867 --> 00:14:07,834
Once she refused to step down,

308
00:14:07,836 --> 00:14:09,602
I knew it was only a matter of time

309
00:14:09,604 --> 00:14:11,738
until she made her way back here.

310
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:13,840
- I want to fix this.
- You can.

311
00:14:13,842 --> 00:14:17,243
Go into the Avatar state
and demolish her army.

312
00:14:17,245 --> 00:14:20,213
Remove Kuvira from power once and for all.

313
00:14:20,215 --> 00:14:22,682
Fighting is something the old me would do,

314
00:14:22,684 --> 00:14:25,585
but that always made things worse.

315
00:14:25,587 --> 00:14:27,420
Let me talk with Kuvira.

316
00:14:27,422 --> 00:14:28,922
Maybe I can reason with her.

317
00:14:28,924 --> 00:14:32,826
Kuvira doesn't listen to reason.

318
00:14:48,843 --> 00:14:51,344
I can't believe Kuvira locked me in here

319
00:14:51,346 --> 00:14:52,478
like a prisoner.

320
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:53,580
I'm not feeling well.

321
00:14:53,582 --> 00:14:55,315
I think I'm running out of air.

322
00:14:55,317 --> 00:14:56,816
Zhu Li, hold your breath.

323
00:14:56,818 --> 00:14:58,017
I'm not holding my breath.

324
00:14:58,019 --> 00:15:00,954
Great. Now we're both gonna die.

325
00:15:00,956 --> 00:15:02,655
Varrick.

326
00:15:02,657 --> 00:15:03,323
Varrick.

327
00:15:03,325 --> 00:15:06,793
Ugh, and the head voices are back.

328
00:15:07,394 --> 00:15:08,995
Bolin, thank goodness you're here.

329
00:15:08,997 --> 00:15:11,531
Where did that hatch come
from? Forget the hatch.

330
00:15:11,533 --> 00:15:13,766
There's something important
I've got to tell you.

331
00:15:13,768 --> 00:15:15,635
Well, there's something important

332
00:15:15,637 --> 00:15:17,604
I've got to tell you too.

333
00:15:17,606 --> 00:15:19,672
Kuvira's crazy.

334
00:15:19,674 --> 00:15:20,573
How'd you find out?

335
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:22,842
When I refused to build her a super weapon,

336
00:15:22,844 --> 00:15:23,877
she threatened my life.

337
00:15:23,879 --> 00:15:26,279
She threatened me too, and
she's threatening Zaofu.

338
00:15:26,281 --> 00:15:28,414
And it turns out she's
been threatening villages

339
00:15:28,416 --> 00:15:29,416
this whole time.

340
00:15:29,417 --> 00:15:30,750
We've got to get out of here.

341
00:15:30,752 --> 00:15:34,387
I couldn't agree more, kid.

342
00:15:42,897 --> 00:15:45,265
We have an unexpected guest.

343
00:15:45,267 --> 00:15:48,735
The Avatar is here to see you.

344
00:15:50,838 --> 00:15:53,339
Korra, it's such an honor to see you again.

345
00:15:53,341 --> 00:15:56,542
The last I heard, you were
still healing in the South pole.

346
00:15:56,544 --> 00:15:59,379
Well, I'm feeling much better now.

347
00:15:59,381 --> 00:16:00,647
That's wonderful news.

348
00:16:00,649 --> 00:16:02,949
I'm here to ask you to back down.

349
00:16:02,951 --> 00:16:05,018
Please, take your army and leave.

350
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:10,356
I think we both know
that's not going to happen.

351
00:16:16,530 --> 00:16:18,398
I can't let you take Zaofu.

352
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:21,067
Look, I was tasked with bringing stability

353
00:16:21,069 --> 00:16:22,568
to the Earth Kingdom.

354
00:16:22,570 --> 00:16:24,504
Zaofu is the last holdout.

355
00:16:24,506 --> 00:16:26,039
Why should I treat it differently

356
00:16:26,041 --> 00:16:27,273
than any other state?

357
00:16:27,275 --> 00:16:28,808
What you're doing isn't right.

358
00:16:28,810 --> 00:16:31,711
I understand you're just
trying to do Su a favor,

359
00:16:31,713 --> 00:16:34,080
but you can't come to
me as I'm on the verge

360
00:16:34,082 --> 00:16:36,749
of reuniting my nation and tell me to stop.

361
00:16:36,751 --> 00:16:40,053
The world was descending into
chaos while you were gone.

362
00:16:40,055 --> 00:16:43,890
In order to fix it, I had
to make some tough decisions.

363
00:16:43,892 --> 00:16:45,325
I know what that's like.

364
00:16:45,327 --> 00:16:47,060
I've had plenty of people mad at me

365
00:16:47,062 --> 00:16:48,728
about decisions I've made.

366
00:16:48,730 --> 00:16:49,595
Exactly.

367
00:16:49,597 --> 00:16:51,597
Korra, if you really want to help,

368
00:16:51,599 --> 00:16:55,535
go back to Su and try to
talk some sense into her.

369
00:16:55,537 --> 00:16:57,270
Let's call a temporary truce.

370
00:16:57,272 --> 00:17:00,173
I won't make any moves
until you talk to her

371
00:17:00,175 --> 00:17:01,240
and get back to me.

372
00:17:01,242 --> 00:17:04,877
Maybe that will be for the best.

373
00:17:04,879 --> 00:17:06,045
Have you seen Bolin?

374
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:10,183
He came by to see Varrick,
but we turned him away.

375
00:17:10,185 --> 00:17:12,518
Open the door.

376
00:17:14,588 --> 00:17:18,358
We have some fugitives to catch.

377
00:17:20,928 --> 00:17:23,496
Okay, I say we go up
and around the mountains

378
00:17:23,498 --> 00:17:25,198
and sneak into Zaofu from the rear.

379
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,733
We're not going to Zaofu.

380
00:17:26,735 --> 00:17:27,867
That place is doomed.

381
00:17:27,869 --> 00:17:29,229
We've got to head to Republic City.

382
00:17:29,253 --> 00:17:31,738
What? No. No, no, no.
We've got to help here.

383
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:33,973
We'll be helping by warning the world

384
00:17:33,975 --> 00:17:36,776
about Kuvira's potential super weapon.

385
00:17:36,778 --> 00:17:37,877
Well, that is helping,

386
00:17:37,879 --> 00:17:40,213
but it's a completely
different type of helping.

387
00:17:40,215 --> 00:17:42,548
Hmm, let me think about this.

388
00:17:42,550 --> 00:17:44,550
Ahh!

389
00:17:44,552 --> 00:17:46,219
Argh!

390
00:17:46,221 --> 00:17:48,021
Ahh!

391
00:17:50,524 --> 00:17:51,858
Argh!

392
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:54,627
Ahh! Ahh!

393
00:17:58,332 --> 00:18:00,066
That's not the flamethrower.

394
00:18:00,068 --> 00:18:02,835
What idiot designed these things?

395
00:18:02,837 --> 00:18:03,770
You did, sir.

396
00:18:03,772 --> 00:18:06,773
Less lecturing, more saving my life.

397
00:18:06,775 --> 00:18:08,574
Ugh!

398
00:18:08,576 --> 00:18:10,910
Ahh!

399
00:18:10,912 --> 00:18:13,179
Argh!

400
00:18:13,181 --> 00:18:14,747
Oh!

401
00:18:14,749 --> 00:18:16,482
Argh!

402
00:18:16,484 --> 00:18:19,552
Ahh!

403
00:18:19,554 --> 00:18:21,087
Ugh.

404
00:18:22,656 --> 00:18:26,259
Ahh!

405
00:18:26,261 --> 00:18:30,563
Argh!

406
00:18:38,705 --> 00:18:39,272
Argh!

407
00:18:39,274 --> 00:18:42,108
Hey, I think I figured it out.

408
00:18:43,977 --> 00:18:45,278
Ahh!

409
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:48,881
Sir, you're making this very difficult.

410
00:18:48,883 --> 00:18:50,716
Ahh!

411
00:18:50,718 --> 00:18:53,986
Argh!

412
00:18:53,988 --> 00:18:55,855
Yah!

413
00:18:57,991 --> 00:19:00,593
Augh!

414
00:19:00,595 --> 00:19:03,863
Ahh!

415
00:19:03,865 --> 00:19:08,101
Argh!

416
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:14,807
Argh!

417
00:19:14,809 --> 00:19:16,209
Augh!

418
00:19:16,211 --> 00:19:18,778
Ahh!

419
00:19:21,648 --> 00:19:23,850
Ahh!

420
00:19:23,852 --> 00:19:25,785
Ahh-ahh!

421
00:19:34,061 --> 00:19:35,761
Argh!

422
00:19:35,763 --> 00:19:36,963
Stop.

423
00:19:36,965 --> 00:19:39,799
Turn yourself over or else.

424
00:19:39,801 --> 00:19:42,802
Thanks a lot, Zhu Li.

425
00:19:49,877 --> 00:19:51,944
You came back.

426
00:19:51,946 --> 00:19:52,845
When I first came here,

427
00:19:52,847 --> 00:19:55,114
it was because I wanted
to tell you face-to-face

428
00:19:55,116 --> 00:19:58,885
that I never wanted to
see or hear from you again.

429
00:19:58,887 --> 00:20:00,720
I wanted my words to hurt you,

430
00:20:00,722 --> 00:20:03,890
so that you would know how you hurt me.

431
00:20:03,892 --> 00:20:04,690
I'm sorry.

432
00:20:04,692 --> 00:20:08,794
But when I saw you, it wasn't anger I felt.

433
00:20:08,796 --> 00:20:10,129
It was sadness.

434
00:20:10,131 --> 00:20:14,333
You tainted our past and
destroyed our future together.

435
00:20:14,335 --> 00:20:15,401
I want to make amends.

436
00:20:15,403 --> 00:20:19,272
I'm not sure I'll ever
be able to forgive you,

437
00:20:19,274 --> 00:20:23,342
but that doesn't mean I shouldn't try.

438
00:20:23,344 --> 00:20:27,046
I thought we could play some Pai Sho,

439
00:20:27,048 --> 00:20:29,182
like we used to.

440
00:20:29,184 --> 00:20:32,585
Nothing would make me happier.

441
00:20:39,159 --> 00:20:41,027
Augh!

442
00:20:43,030 --> 00:20:44,897
Don't torture us.

443
00:20:44,899 --> 00:20:47,700
Send these three away on the next train.

444
00:20:47,702 --> 00:20:51,571
Bolin and Zhu Li will be
going to the reeducation camp

445
00:20:51,573 --> 00:20:53,206
for our most severe dissenters.

446
00:20:53,208 --> 00:20:57,076
And you will continue work
on the spirit energy project

447
00:20:57,078 --> 00:20:59,845
under close, armed supervision.

448
00:20:59,847 --> 00:21:03,082
I want it weaponized immediately.

449
00:21:03,084 --> 00:21:04,917
Please, have mercy on me.

450
00:21:04,919 --> 00:21:08,187
Don't send me away. Take me back.

451
00:21:08,189 --> 00:21:08,921
Why would I?

452
00:21:08,923 --> 00:21:13,259
Because my only mistake was
being loyal to the wrong person.

453
00:21:13,261 --> 00:21:14,827
I was blindly devoted to Varrick,

454
00:21:14,829 --> 00:21:17,263
and I looked past all
the times he ridiculed me

455
00:21:17,265 --> 00:21:21,400
or ordered me around or made
me clean his disgusting feet,

456
00:21:21,402 --> 00:21:24,470
because I thought he possessed
the most brilliant mind

457
00:21:24,472 --> 00:21:27,340
in the world, but when I met you,

458
00:21:27,342 --> 00:21:28,908
I realized I was wrong.

459
00:21:28,910 --> 00:21:31,711
Compared to you, Varrick's a fool.

460
00:21:31,713 --> 00:21:33,412
Hey, come on. I'm right here.

461
00:21:33,414 --> 00:21:35,381
I believe in everything you've done,

462
00:21:35,383 --> 00:21:37,216
and I believe in your vision.

463
00:21:37,218 --> 00:21:39,485
I want to devote my life to you.

464
00:21:39,487 --> 00:21:44,390
I pledge my allegiance
to you, great uniter.

465
00:21:44,392 --> 00:21:47,393
You two could learn something from her.

466
00:21:47,395 --> 00:21:48,527
Rise, Zhu Li.

467
00:21:48,529 --> 00:21:50,263
I'll give you another chance.

468
00:21:50,265 --> 00:21:52,398
Think about what you're doing.

469
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,966
We're partners.

470
00:21:53,968 --> 00:21:54,834
We have history.

471
00:21:54,836 --> 00:21:56,902
I did everything you ever asked of me,

472
00:21:56,904 --> 00:21:58,971
and you never appreciated it.

473
00:21:58,973 --> 00:22:00,973
Guards, do the thing.

474
00:22:00,975 --> 00:22:04,010
No, not the thing.

475
00:22:04,012 --> 00:22:06,812
Zhu Li.

476
00:22:07,881 --> 00:22:10,016
Where's Su? I have to talk to her.

477
00:22:10,018 --> 00:22:11,183
She's not here.

478
00:22:11,185 --> 00:22:12,318
She took Wing and Wei.

479
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:14,654
They're going to sneak into Kuvira's camp

480
00:22:14,656 --> 00:22:16,489
and put an end to this.

481
00:22:16,491 --> 00:22:18,321
No.
