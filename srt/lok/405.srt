1
00:00:07,667 --> 00:00:08,875
- EARTH.

2
00:00:08,917 --> 00:00:10,500
FIRE.

3
00:00:10,542 --> 00:00:12,250
AIR.

4
00:00:12,291 --> 00:00:14,458
WATER.

5
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:18,250
ONLY THE AVATAR CAN MASTER
ALL FOUR ELEMENTS

6
00:00:18,291 --> 00:00:20,583
AND BRING BALANCE
TO THE WORLD.

7
00:00:27,041 --> 00:00:28,417
- AFTER THREE YEARS,
KUVIRA HAS UNITED

8
00:00:28,458 --> 00:00:29,583
THE FORMER EARTH KINGDOM STATES

9
00:00:29,625 --> 00:00:31,750
UNDER HER NEW
EARTH EMPIRE BANNER.

10
00:00:31,792 --> 00:00:33,667
BUT ONE HOLDOUT REMAINS:
ZAOFU.

11
00:00:33,709 --> 00:00:35,166
DURING THAT SAME TIME,

12
00:00:35,208 --> 00:00:37,250
ASAMI REBUILT THE COMPANY
HER FATHER CREATED

13
00:00:37,291 --> 00:00:39,458
AND HELPED REDESIGN
THE CITY'S INFRASTRUCTURE.

14
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:41,834
AND MOST RECENTLY, THE
AIRBENDER KIDS FOUND THE AVATAR.

15
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:44,625
KORRA RID HERSELF OF
THE RESIDUAL POISON IN HER BODY

16
00:00:44,667 --> 00:00:46,834
AND IS READY TO RETURN
TO ACTION.

17
00:01:09,417 --> 00:01:10,875
- WE HAVE AN EMERGENCY.

18
00:01:15,458 --> 00:01:17,208
- I'LL CONTACT PRESIDENT RAIKO.

19
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:19,542
HE'LL SEND THE UNITED FORCES.

20
00:01:22,041 --> 00:01:24,875
- CALL WHOMEVER YOU WANT, BUT
THEY'LL NEVER MAKE IT IN TIME.

21
00:01:24,917 --> 00:01:28,458
KUVIRA'S ALREADY HERE,
AND SHE BROUGHT HER ENTIRE ARMY.

22
00:01:39,792 --> 00:01:41,125
- BY THIS TIME TOMORROW,

23
00:01:41,166 --> 00:01:42,750
MY MOTHER WILL HAVE SIGNED
OUR TREATY,

24
00:01:42,792 --> 00:01:45,250
AND THE EARTH EMPIRE
WILL FINALLY BE UNITED.

25
00:01:45,291 --> 00:01:46,875
- DON'T GET AHEAD OF YOURSELF.

26
00:01:46,917 --> 00:01:50,709
SECURING YOUR HOMETOWN
WON'T BE LIKE EVERY OTHER CITY.

27
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:54,083
- ZAOFU STOPPED BEING MY HOME
LONG AGO.

28
00:01:54,125 --> 00:01:56,000
I'M READY TO TAKE IT BY FORCE.

29
00:01:56,041 --> 00:01:57,375
- NO.

30
00:01:57,417 --> 00:01:59,208
THE EYES OF THE WORLD
ARE ON US NOW.

31
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:01,166
WE MUST DO THIS RIGHT.

32
00:02:01,208 --> 00:02:02,750
THAT'S WHY WE NEED BOLIN.

33
00:02:02,792 --> 00:02:05,709
- DO YOU REALLY THINK
WE CAN RELY ON HIM?

34
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:07,166
- SU TRUSTS HIM.

35
00:02:07,208 --> 00:02:09,750
SHE'LL LISTEN TO HIM.

36
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:12,875
- ARE YOU SURE WE SHOULD BE
GOING TO ZAOFU?

37
00:02:12,917 --> 00:02:15,625
DAD WANTED US TO BRING YOU
BACK TO REPUBLIC CITY.

38
00:02:15,667 --> 00:02:18,291
- IF KUVIRA'S HEADING TO ZAOFU,
SO AM I.

39
00:02:18,333 --> 00:02:20,625
SHE NEEDS TO KNOW
THAT THE AVATAR IS BACK.

40
00:02:20,667 --> 00:02:21,959
THE WORLD NEEDS TO KNOW.

41
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,542
- WHOO-HOO!

42
00:02:23,583 --> 00:02:25,208
AVATAR FIGHT!

43
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:28,291
THIS IS GOING TO BE AWESOME!

44
00:02:28,333 --> 00:02:30,166
- MEELO,
THERE'S NOT GONNA BE A FIGHT.

45
00:02:30,208 --> 00:02:31,917
KUVIRA SAVED MY DAD.

46
00:02:31,959 --> 00:02:33,291
SHE WAS A CAPTAIN IN SU'S GUARD.

47
00:02:33,333 --> 00:02:35,083
I THINK SHE CAN BE
REASONED WITH.

48
00:02:35,125 --> 00:02:37,375
- WHAT?
NO FIGHT?

49
00:02:37,417 --> 00:02:40,291
WHY DID WE GO THROUGH ALL
THAT TROUBLE TO SAVE YOU

50
00:02:40,333 --> 00:02:43,500
IF YOU'RE NOT GOING TO
BEAT SOMEONE UP?

51
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:49,208
- ZHU LI,
IS THIS THING ON?

52
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:51,208
- WE'RE ROLLING, SIR.

53
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:54,291
- OKAY, I'M VARRICK OF VARRICK
INDUSTRIES INTERNATIONAL,

54
00:02:54,333 --> 00:02:58,125
AND THIS IS
SPIRIT VINE EXPERIMENT 3-02

55
00:02:58,166 --> 00:02:59,959
HAND ME THE THING.

56
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,125
[grunting]

57
00:03:04,166 --> 00:03:08,208
IN THIS STASIS CAPSULE IS A
PRESERVED SPIRIT VINE SAMPLE

58
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:11,417
WEIGHING APPROXIMATELY
TWO ZHU LIS.

59
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:15,875
I HAVE POSTULATED
THAT THESE SPIRIT VINES

60
00:03:15,917 --> 00:03:18,792
ARE A FORM OF PURE ENERGY
THAT'S UNSTABLE

61
00:03:18,834 --> 00:03:21,667
IN WHAT WE CALL
"TYPICAL EARTH CONDITIONS."

62
00:03:21,709 --> 00:03:24,542
THIS MACHINE SHOULD TRANSFER
THE ENERGY FROM THE VINE

63
00:03:24,583 --> 00:03:27,166
INTO A BATTERY
USING ELECTRICAL CURRENTS,

64
00:03:27,208 --> 00:03:28,875
REVERSE MAGNETIC POLARITY,

65
00:03:28,917 --> 00:03:34,166
AND A LITTLE-KNOWN PHENOMENON
I CALL THE VARRI-EFFECT.

66
00:03:37,041 --> 00:03:38,583
IT'S WORKING.

67
00:03:38,625 --> 00:03:41,083
IT'S REGISTERING FIVE VARRICKS
OF POWER...

68
00:03:41,125 --> 00:03:45,250
NOW SEVEN VARRICKS.

69
00:03:46,583 --> 00:03:49,792
WHOA.
WHAT IS THIS?

70
00:03:49,834 --> 00:03:52,583
WHAT'S GOING ON?

71
00:03:52,625 --> 00:03:53,917
- OH!

72
00:03:53,959 --> 00:03:55,250
- AHH!

73
00:03:55,291 --> 00:03:57,083
ZHU LI,
SHUT IT DOWN.

74
00:03:57,125 --> 00:03:58,709
THERE ARE TOO MANY VARRICKS.

75
00:04:08,834 --> 00:04:10,667
AHH!

76
00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:13,041
- AHH!

77
00:04:13,083 --> 00:04:16,125
SIR...

78
00:04:16,166 --> 00:04:18,125
- [grunting]

79
00:04:18,166 --> 00:04:19,709
YOU'RE TOO HEAVY.

80
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:23,125
YOU KNOW, YOU COULD STAND
TO LOSE A FEW ZHU LIS.

81
00:04:23,166 --> 00:04:24,792
- I THINK YOU'RE JUST WEAK, SIR.

82
00:04:24,834 --> 00:04:26,208
PULL HARDER.

83
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:28,709
- [grunting]

84
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:31,667
both: AHH!

85
00:04:33,625 --> 00:04:36,959
- VARRICK,
YOU SAVED ME.

86
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,667
- OF COURSE I SAVED YOU.

87
00:04:38,709 --> 00:04:41,709
I CAN'T CLEAN THIS PLACE UP
BY MYSELF.

88
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:42,750
GRAB A BROOM.

89
00:04:42,792 --> 00:04:44,959
- WHAT HAPPENED?
WERE WE ATTACKED?

90
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,709
- NO, WE WERE SPIRIT-VINED,
BUT DON'T WORRY.

91
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:51,083
I'M PUTTING THE KIBOSH
ON THIS PROJECT.

92
00:04:51,125 --> 00:04:52,709
- NO, YOU'RE NOT.

93
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:55,041
DO YOU REALIZE WHAT WE CAN DO
WITH THIS KIND OF POWER?

94
00:04:55,083 --> 00:04:56,792
- YES, I DO.

95
00:04:56,834 --> 00:04:58,458
AND THAT'S WHY WE'VE GOT TO
PUT AN END TO IT.

96
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,291
WHAT IF IT FELL INTO
THE WRONG HANDS?

97
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:02,500
- SINCE WHEN DOES THAT MATTER
TO YOU?

98
00:05:02,542 --> 00:05:03,875
- I KNOW.
IT'S NOT LIKE ME, RIGHT?

99
00:05:03,917 --> 00:05:05,917
USUALLY,
I LOOK AT A PROJECT LIKE THIS,

100
00:05:05,959 --> 00:05:09,333
AND ALL I THINK IS, "WOW, I CAN
MAKE A TON OF MONEY OFF THIS."

101
00:05:09,375 --> 00:05:13,875
BUT RECENTLY, I'VE BEEN HAVING
THESE STRANGE FEELINGS INSIDE.

102
00:05:13,917 --> 00:05:17,083
IT'S LIKE I'M...
CONCERNED WITH OTHERS.

103
00:05:17,125 --> 00:05:19,667
AND THERE'S THIS NAGGING VOICE
IN MY HEAD

104
00:05:19,709 --> 00:05:22,667
CONSTANTLY TELLING ME
WHAT'S RIGHT FROM WRONG.

105
00:05:22,709 --> 00:05:25,750
- I BELIEVE THAT VOICE
IS YOUR CONSCIENCE, SIR.

106
00:05:25,792 --> 00:05:27,333
- WELL, I'M THE OTHER VOICE
IN YOUR HEAD,

107
00:05:27,375 --> 00:05:30,208
AND I'M TELLING YOU,
YOU WILL CONTINUE THIS PROJECT.

108
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:31,792
- SORRY, NO.

109
00:05:31,834 --> 00:05:34,208
I JUST REALLY GOT TO STAND
MY GROUND ON THIS ONE.

110
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:35,667
WHOA!

111
00:05:35,709 --> 00:05:37,500
- NOW THERE'S A VOICE IN MY HEAD
TELLING ME

112
00:05:37,542 --> 00:05:39,125
TO DROP YOU ON THE TRACKS.

113
00:05:39,166 --> 00:05:41,041
SHOULD I LISTEN?

114
00:05:41,083 --> 00:05:42,333
- NO, NO.

115
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:45,291
HEAD VOICES ARE LIARS.
WHAT DO HEAD VOICES KNOW?

116
00:05:45,333 --> 00:05:46,375
I'LL WORK ON THE PROJECT.

117
00:05:46,417 --> 00:05:48,750
PLEASE DON'T DROP ME.

118
00:05:48,792 --> 00:05:51,458
AHH!

119
00:06:04,625 --> 00:06:06,166
- ASAMI, YOU CAME.

120
00:06:11,083 --> 00:06:13,667
I'M HERE TO RETURN THESE.

121
00:06:13,709 --> 00:06:15,125
- YOU NEVER OPENED THEM.

122
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:16,500
- STOP WRITING ME.

123
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:19,583
I NEVER WANT TO SEE
OR HEAR FROM YOU AGAIN.

124
00:06:20,917 --> 00:06:22,667
- PLEASE,
JUST LET ME SAY ONE THING,

125
00:06:22,709 --> 00:06:26,417
THEN I'LL NEVER CONTACT YOU
AGAIN.

126
00:06:26,458 --> 00:06:30,000
I CAN'T FORGIVE MYSELF FOR ALL
THE HORRIBLE THINGS I'VE DONE,

127
00:06:30,041 --> 00:06:32,000
AND I NEVER EXPECT YOU
TO FORGIVE ME.

128
00:06:32,041 --> 00:06:35,166
I TORE OUR FAMILY APART
AND DESTROYED OUR GOOD NAME.

129
00:06:35,625 --> 00:06:38,000
BUT IN A LIFE OF REGRET,

130
00:06:38,041 --> 00:06:42,291
YOU'RE THE ONE THING I LOOK
BACK ON THAT MAKES ME SMILE.

131
00:06:43,458 --> 00:06:47,000
I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW
I'M SO PROUD OF YOU, ASAMI.

132
00:06:47,041 --> 00:06:51,125
YOU ARE THE GREATEST THING
I EVER CREATED.

133
00:07:02,667 --> 00:07:04,500
- AM I IN TROUBLE?

134
00:07:04,875 --> 00:07:07,792
- NO.
IN FACT, I HAVE GOOD NEWS.

135
00:07:07,834 --> 00:07:10,667
WE WANT YOU TO BE PART
OF OUR INNER CIRCLE.

136
00:07:10,709 --> 00:07:12,792
- INNER CIRCLE! NO WAY! YES!

137
00:07:12,834 --> 00:07:16,333
AHEM,
THAT IS A GREAT HONOR.

138
00:07:16,375 --> 00:07:17,709
WHAT DOES IT MEAN,
EXACTLY?

139
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:19,625
- IT MEANS YOU'VE PROVEN
YOUR WORTH.

140
00:07:19,667 --> 00:07:21,959
WE'RE SO CLOSE TO UNITING
THE EMPIRE,

141
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,542
BUT SU HAS SOME RESENTMENT
TOWARDS ME AND BAATAR

142
00:07:24,583 --> 00:07:26,125
THAT MIGHT CLOUD HER JUDGMENT

143
00:07:26,166 --> 00:07:28,917
AND STOP HER FROM MAKING
A WISE DECISION.

144
00:07:28,959 --> 00:07:31,125
WE BELIEVE YOU CAN HELP HER
SEE CLEARLY.

145
00:07:31,166 --> 00:07:32,500
- I CAN DO THAT.

146
00:07:32,542 --> 00:07:34,375
BY THE TIME I'M FINISHED
TELLING HER

147
00:07:34,417 --> 00:07:36,709
ALL THE GREAT THINGS WE'VE DONE,
SHE'LL BE BEGGING TO JOIN.

148
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:38,542
- GOOD,
BECAUSE WE'RE HERE.

149
00:07:41,375 --> 00:07:43,959
- AREN'T ALL THESE TROOPS
GONNA SEND THE WRONG MESSAGE?

150
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
- THE ARMY IS HERE
TO PROJECT STRENGTH.

151
00:07:46,041 --> 00:07:48,667
YOU'RE HERE TO PRESENT PEACE.

152
00:07:59,834 --> 00:08:01,625
- OPAL,
YOU'RE HERE TOO.

153
00:08:01,667 --> 00:08:04,250
- NO,
YOU'VE CHOSEN YOUR SIDE.

154
00:08:04,291 --> 00:08:06,792
- SIDES?
THERE SHOULDN'T BE SIDES.

155
00:08:06,834 --> 00:08:09,125
I KNOW, WHY DON'T WE ALL STAND
IN A CIRCLE, HUH,

156
00:08:09,166 --> 00:08:10,375
MAYBE HOLD HANDS?

157
00:08:10,417 --> 00:08:12,000
- I'M NOT GIVING UP ZAOFU.

158
00:08:12,041 --> 00:08:14,417
I DON'T CARE IF YOU BROUGHT
YOUR ENTIRE ARMY.

159
00:08:14,458 --> 00:08:17,041
- SU, I DIDN'T BRING MY ARMY
TO THREATEN YOU.

160
00:08:17,083 --> 00:08:18,709
I WANTED TO SHOW YOU
ALL THAT YOUR SON AND I

161
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:20,166
HAVE ACCOMPLISHED.

162
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:22,041
- YOU MUST REALIZE
WHAT YOU'RE DOING

163
00:08:22,083 --> 00:08:25,166
GOES AGAINST EVERYTHING YOUR
FATHER AND I TRIED TO TEACH YOU.

164
00:08:25,208 --> 00:08:27,166
- SON, YOU BELONG HERE.

165
00:08:27,208 --> 00:08:28,792
- WHY?

166
00:08:28,834 --> 00:08:30,750
SO THAT I CAN GO ON LIVING
IN YOUR SHADOW?

167
00:08:30,792 --> 00:08:32,500
- DON'T SAY THAT.

168
00:08:32,542 --> 00:08:34,625
CAN'T YOU SEE
SHE'S BRAINWASHED YOU.

169
00:08:34,667 --> 00:08:37,000
- HA,
I DIDN'T BRAINWASH HIM.

170
00:08:37,041 --> 00:08:38,542
I SET HIM FREE.

171
00:08:38,583 --> 00:08:40,083
AND NOW HE'S ACCOMPLISHED
MORE WITH ME

172
00:08:40,125 --> 00:08:41,750
THAN HE EVER COULD HAVE
WITH YOU.

173
00:08:41,792 --> 00:08:45,417
- OKAY, GUYS, OBVIOUSLY,
THERE'S A LOT OF PERSONAL,

174
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:47,166
PAINFUL HISTORY HERE.

175
00:08:47,208 --> 00:08:49,417
SO WHAT DO SAY WE JUST ALL
FORGET ABOUT THAT STUFF, HUH?

176
00:08:49,458 --> 00:08:50,917
I MEAN,
THAT'S THE PAST.

177
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:52,750
RIGHT, WING?
RIGHT, WEI?

178
00:08:52,792 --> 00:08:54,083
YOU GUYS KNOW
WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.

179
00:08:54,125 --> 00:08:57,166
HIGH FIVE.

180
00:08:57,208 --> 00:08:59,041
ALL RIGHT.
NO, IT'S COOL.

181
00:08:59,083 --> 00:09:00,500
YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK
WE NEED TO DO?

182
00:09:00,542 --> 00:09:02,166
FOCUS ON THE FUTURE.

183
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:04,166
AND THE FUTURE IS BRIGHT.
LET ME TELL YOU.

184
00:09:04,208 --> 00:09:06,750
I'VE SEEN IT.
YEAH, SAW IT LAST MONTH.

185
00:09:06,792 --> 00:09:09,083
WE WENT TO THIS TOWN
THAT HAD NOTHING.

186
00:09:09,125 --> 00:09:10,792
MOST OF THE PEOPLE THERE
HAD NEVER EVEN SEEN

187
00:09:10,834 --> 00:09:12,583
A SATOMOBILE BEFORE.

188
00:09:12,625 --> 00:09:15,667
BUT NOW THEY HAVE
TWO SATOMOBILES,

189
00:09:15,709 --> 00:09:17,583
RUNNING WATER,
AND A MAGNET TRAIN

190
00:09:17,625 --> 00:09:19,083
THAT GOES RIGHT THROUGH
THEIR TOWN.

191
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:21,208
I MEAN,
HOW AWESOME IS THAT?

192
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:23,458
- THEY MIGHT HAVE BEEN HAPPY
WHEN YOU FIRST ARRIVED,

193
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:25,333
BUT I'VE SEEN WHAT HAPPENS
AFTER YOU LEAVE.

194
00:09:25,375 --> 00:09:28,125
CITIZENS ARE FORCED TO WORK
AS SLAVE LABOR.

195
00:09:28,166 --> 00:09:30,125
DISSENTERS ARE SENT OFF
TO WHO KNOWS WHERE.

196
00:09:30,166 --> 00:09:31,834
- YOU'RE WRONG, OPAL.

197
00:09:31,875 --> 00:09:33,583
NOW, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU THINK YOU'VE SEEN,

198
00:09:33,625 --> 00:09:35,792
BUT I'M GIVING YOU
THE 100% BOLIN GUARANTEE

199
00:09:35,834 --> 00:09:37,166
THAT WE'RE MAKING
THE EARTH EMPIRE

200
00:09:37,208 --> 00:09:38,667
A BETTER PLACE TO LIVE.

201
00:09:38,709 --> 00:09:41,208
- I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU BROUGHT BOLIN HERE

202
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:42,959
TO TRY TO SWAY US.

203
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,417
LEAVE.

204
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:46,834
ZAOFU WILL NEVER ACCEPT YOU
AS THEIR LEADER.

205
00:09:46,875 --> 00:09:48,917
- THEN YOU LEAVE ME NO CHOICE.

206
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:51,834
YOU HAVE 24 HOURS TO AGREE
TO JOIN THE EMPIRE,

207
00:09:51,875 --> 00:09:54,458
OR WE TAKE THE CITY BY FORCE.

208
00:10:01,583 --> 00:10:03,917
- I SEE IT.
ZAOFU.

209
00:10:03,959 --> 00:10:06,125
WE MADE IT.

210
00:10:06,166 --> 00:10:10,875
AND A BUNCH OF OTHER PEOPLE
ARE HERE TOO.

211
00:10:10,917 --> 00:10:12,291
- OH, NO.

212
00:10:12,333 --> 00:10:14,083
I HOPE WE'RE NOT TOO LATE.

213
00:10:17,291 --> 00:10:18,750
- KORRA?

214
00:10:18,792 --> 00:10:21,166
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?

215
00:10:21,208 --> 00:10:23,542
YOU DISAPPEARED.
EVERYONE WAS SO WORRIED.

216
00:10:23,583 --> 00:10:25,500
, I'LL TELL YOU THE WHOLE STORY
LATER.

217
00:10:25,542 --> 00:10:28,041
RIGHT NOW,
I WANT TO HELP YOU STOP KUVIRA.

218
00:10:28,083 --> 00:10:30,709
WHAT CAN I DO?

219
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:32,500
- YOU WERE JUST BLUFFING, RIGHT?

220
00:10:32,542 --> 00:10:35,458
I MEAN, YOU'RE NOT REALLY
GOING TO ATTACK ZAOFU...ARE YOU?

221
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:38,125
- WHEN PEOPLE DON'T COOPERATE,
WE MUST FIND OTHER WAYS

222
00:10:38,166 --> 00:10:39,583
OF CONVINCING THEM TO JOIN.

223
00:10:39,625 --> 00:10:41,500
- OTHER WAYS?

224
00:10:41,542 --> 00:10:43,709
HOW MANY TIMES HAVE WE USED
THESE OTHER WAYS

225
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:45,041
IN THE PAST?

226
00:10:45,083 --> 00:10:46,625
- IT'S NOT FOR YOU
TO WORRY ABOUT.

227
00:10:46,667 --> 00:10:49,375
- SO...
WHAT DOES HAPPEN

228
00:10:49,417 --> 00:10:52,125
TO ALL OF THOSE TOWNS
AND VILLAGES AFTER WE LEAVE?

229
00:10:52,166 --> 00:10:54,542
I JUST REALIZED
I'VE NEVER REALLY GONE BACK

230
00:10:54,583 --> 00:10:56,000
AND CHECKED ON THEM.

231
00:10:56,041 --> 00:10:58,208
- THOSE PEOPLE
ARE MY LOYAL SUBJECTS,

232
00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:01,208
AND THEY CONTRIBUTE
TO THE EMPIRE HOWEVER I SEE FIT.

233
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:03,000
NOW THAT YOU'RE IN
THE INNER CIRCLE,

234
00:11:03,041 --> 00:11:05,500
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO ACCEPT
SOME HARD TRUTHS.

235
00:11:05,542 --> 00:11:09,083
- MAYBE I'M NOT REALLY
AN INNER-CIRCLE KIND OF GUY.

236
00:11:09,125 --> 00:11:11,959
OR--OR MAYBE
WE DON'T TAKE OVER ZAOFU.

237
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,542
WE COULD JUST LET THEM BE
ON THEIR OWN,

238
00:11:13,583 --> 00:11:15,041
THEN YAY,
THE EMPIRE'S UNITED.

239
00:11:15,083 --> 00:11:17,041
CONGRATULATIONS TO US.

240
00:11:17,083 --> 00:11:19,166
- I DIDN'T KNOW
YOUR PERSONAL FEELINGS FOR OPAL

241
00:11:19,208 --> 00:11:21,417
WERE STRONGER THAN
YOUR LOYALTY TO ME.

242
00:11:21,458 --> 00:11:23,750
ZAOFU WILL JOIN US.

243
00:11:23,792 --> 00:11:25,667
THE ONLY THING
I'M SECOND-GUESSING

244
00:11:25,709 --> 00:11:27,750
IS THE DECISION
TO BRING YOU ALONG.

245
00:11:27,792 --> 00:11:31,333
MAYBE YOU NEED TO SPEND
SOME TIME IN A REEDUCATION CAMP.

246
00:11:31,375 --> 00:11:33,500
- I THOUGHT THAT'S WHERE
WE SEND PEOPLE

247
00:11:33,542 --> 00:11:35,458
TO LEARN NEW TRADE SKILLS.

248
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:37,667
- HARD TRUTHS, BOLIN.

249
00:11:37,709 --> 00:11:40,583
- YOUR LOYALTY
SEEMS TO BE WAVERING.

250
00:11:40,625 --> 00:11:44,083
- NO, NO,
I'M TOTALLY ON YOUR SIDE,

251
00:11:44,125 --> 00:11:47,667
COMPLETELY 100% LOYAL.

252
00:11:51,834 --> 00:11:54,792
- HOW DID THINGS GET SO BAD
BETWEEN YOU AND KUVIRA?

253
00:11:54,834 --> 00:11:56,333
I THOUGHT SHE WAS YOUR PROTEGE?

254
00:11:56,375 --> 00:11:58,125
- SHE WAS MORE THAN THAT.

255
00:11:58,166 --> 00:11:59,917
SHE WAS LIKE A DAUGHTER TO ME.

256
00:11:59,959 --> 00:12:02,041
I TOOK HER IN
WHEN SHE WAS EIGHT YEARS OLD

257
00:12:02,083 --> 00:12:03,542
AND NOURISHED HER TALENTS.

258
00:12:03,583 --> 00:12:06,375
KUVIRA WAS SMART,
A NATURAL LEADER,

259
00:12:06,417 --> 00:12:08,500
AND QUICKLY ROSE
THROUGH THE RANKS.

260
00:12:08,542 --> 00:12:10,542
I SAW MYSELF IN HER.

261
00:12:10,583 --> 00:12:12,542
- WHAT HAPPENED?

262
00:12:12,583 --> 00:12:15,583
- THREE YEARS AGO, AFTER
THE FALL OF THE EARTH QUEEN,

263
00:12:15,625 --> 00:12:18,375
RAIKO AND TENZIN
CAME TO SEE ME.

264
00:12:18,417 --> 00:12:20,083
- THE EARTH KINGDOM IS IN CHAOS.

265
00:12:20,125 --> 00:12:22,542
THERE'S A VACUUM OF POWER,
AND I'M CONCERNED ABOUT

266
00:12:22,583 --> 00:12:24,709
WHAT WILL HAPPEN
IF SOMEONE DOESN'T TAKE CONTROL

267
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:26,000
OF THE SITUATION.

268
00:12:26,041 --> 00:12:27,834
- AND DO YOU THINK I SHOULD BE
THE ONE?

269
00:12:27,875 --> 00:12:30,166
- YOU'RE THE PERFECT PERSON
TO TAKE CHARGE.

270
00:12:30,208 --> 00:12:32,667
THE WORLD LEADERS TRUST YOU,
AND AS A BEIFONG,

271
00:12:32,709 --> 00:12:34,583
YOU HAVE CREDIBILITY
IN THE EARTH KINGDOM.

272
00:12:34,625 --> 00:12:36,333
- I'M HONORED
THAT YOU THOUGHT OF ME,

273
00:12:36,375 --> 00:12:38,792
BUT I'M NOT INTERESTED
IN IMPOSING MY IDEALS

274
00:12:38,834 --> 00:12:40,792
ON AN ENTIRE NATION.

275
00:12:40,834 --> 00:12:42,709
I'M AFRAID I CAN'T HELP YOU.

276
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:45,083
- SUYIN,
I KNOW THIS ISN'T MY PLACE,

277
00:12:45,125 --> 00:12:47,166
BUT I THINK YOU SHOULD DO THIS.

278
00:12:47,208 --> 00:12:49,208
ZAOFU HAS ALWAYS BEEN A BEACON
OF MODERN PROGRESS,

279
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:51,500
AND NOW YOU CAN SHARE THAT
WITH EVERYONE.

280
00:12:51,542 --> 00:12:53,208
- WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE ME DO,

281
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:55,375
MARCH INTO BA SING
SE WITH AN ARMY?

282
00:12:55,417 --> 00:12:56,834
WE'D BE SEEN AS CONQUERORS

283
00:12:56,875 --> 00:12:58,834
AND GREETED WITH NOTHING
BUT WAR.

284
00:12:58,875 --> 00:13:00,500
- THERE ARE ALREADY WARS.

285
00:13:00,542 --> 00:13:02,959
THE EARTH QUEEN NEARLY DESTROYED
OUR NATION.

286
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,667
THIS IS OUR OPPORTUNITY
TO CHANGE THINGS.

287
00:13:05,709 --> 00:13:08,000
- IT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN.

288
00:13:09,375 --> 00:13:11,291
I DIDN'T REALIZE AT THE TIME,

289
00:13:11,333 --> 00:13:16,125
BUT THAT MOMENT CREATED A RIFT
BETWEEN US.

290
00:13:16,166 --> 00:13:18,709
KUVIRA TURNED MY OWN SON
AGAINST ME.

291
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:22,333
AND TOGETHER THEY PLOTTED
BEHIND MY BACK.

292
00:13:22,375 --> 00:13:24,291
WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING?

293
00:13:24,333 --> 00:13:26,875
- WE'RE DOING WHAT YOU
DON'T HAVE THE GUTS TO DO.

294
00:13:26,917 --> 00:13:29,083
WE'RE GOING TO BA SING SE
TO HELP BRING ORDER BACK

295
00:13:29,125 --> 00:13:30,333
TO THE EARTH KINGDOM.

296
00:13:30,375 --> 00:13:32,750
- NO.
YOU WILL STAY HERE.

297
00:13:32,792 --> 00:13:34,834
- AND WHO'S GOING TO STOP ME?

298
00:13:34,875 --> 00:13:36,834
YOUR SECURITY FORCE
WAS MORE THAN HAPPY

299
00:13:36,875 --> 00:13:38,333
TO JOIN MY CAUSE.

300
00:13:38,375 --> 00:13:40,166
THEY'RE SOME OF
THE BEST FIGHTERS IN THE WORLD,

301
00:13:40,208 --> 00:13:41,750
AND THEY ARE TIRED
OF BEING TREATED

302
00:13:41,792 --> 00:13:43,709
LIKE EXOTIC BIRDS IN YOUR CAGE.

303
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:47,333
- IF YOU LEAVE NOW,
YOU WILL NEVER BE WELCOMED BACK.

304
00:13:47,375 --> 00:13:51,208
- WHEN I CHOOSE TO RETURN,
IT WILL BE ON MY OWN TERMS.

305
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:54,667
- KUVIRA AND BAATAR LEFT
THAT DAY WITH VARRICK,

306
00:13:54,709 --> 00:13:58,291
MY SECURITY FORCE, AND A FEW
OF ZAOFU'S WEALTHIEST CITIZENS.

307
00:13:58,333 --> 00:14:02,083
AFTER KUVIRA PROVED HERSELF
BY STABILIZING BA SING SE,

308
00:14:02,125 --> 00:14:04,000
RAIKO AND THE OTHER WORLD
LEADERS MADE HER

309
00:14:04,041 --> 00:14:06,792
THE PROVISIONAL HEAD
OF THE EARTH KINGDOM.

310
00:14:06,834 --> 00:14:08,875
ONCE SHE REFUSED TO STEP DOWN,

311
00:14:08,917 --> 00:14:10,583
I KNEW IT WAS ONLY
A MATTER OF TIME

312
00:14:10,625 --> 00:14:12,750
UNTIL SHE MADE HER WAY
BACK HERE.

313
00:14:12,792 --> 00:14:15,125
- I WANT TO FIX THIS.
- YOU CAN.

314
00:14:15,166 --> 00:14:18,250
GO INTO THE AVATAR STATE
AND DEMOLISH HER ARMY.

315
00:14:18,291 --> 00:14:21,333
REMOVE KUVIRA FROM POWER
ONCE AND FOR ALL.

316
00:14:21,375 --> 00:14:23,709
- FIGHTING IS SOMETHING
THE OLD ME WOULD DO,

317
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:26,250
BUT THAT ALWAYS
MADE THINGS WORSE.

318
00:14:26,291 --> 00:14:28,166
LET ME TALK WITH KUVIRA.

319
00:14:28,208 --> 00:14:30,000
MAYBE I CAN REASON WITH HER.

320
00:14:30,041 --> 00:14:32,875
- KUVIRA DOESN'T LISTEN
TO REASON.

321
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,750
- I CAN'T BELIEVE KUVIRA
LOCKED ME IN HERE

322
00:14:51,792 --> 00:14:53,083
LIKE A PRISONER.

323
00:14:53,125 --> 00:14:54,417
I'M NOT FEELING WELL.

324
00:14:54,458 --> 00:14:56,000
I THINK I'M RUNNING OUT OF AIR.

325
00:14:56,041 --> 00:14:57,625
ZHU LI,
HOLD YOUR BREATH.

326
00:14:57,667 --> 00:14:58,834
- I'M NOT HOLDING MY BREATH.

327
00:14:58,875 --> 00:15:01,250
- GREAT.
NOW WE'RE BOTH GONNA DIE.

328
00:15:01,291 --> 00:15:03,041
- VARRICK.

329
00:15:03,083 --> 00:15:04,375
VARRICK.

330
00:15:04,417 --> 00:15:06,875
- AUGH,
AND THE HEAD VOICES ARE BACK.

331
00:15:08,417 --> 00:15:10,166
BOLIN,
THANK GOODNESS YOU'RE HERE.

332
00:15:10,208 --> 00:15:12,875
WHERE DID THAT HATCH COME FROM?
FORGET THE HATCH.

333
00:15:12,917 --> 00:15:14,875
THERE'S SOMETHING IMPORTANT
I'VE GOT TO TELL YOU.

334
00:15:14,917 --> 00:15:16,333
- WELL,
THERE'S SOMETHING IMPORTANT

335
00:15:16,375 --> 00:15:18,375
I'VE GOT TELL YOU TOO.

336
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:20,375
both:
KUVIRA'S CRAZY.

337
00:15:20,417 --> 00:15:21,834
- HOW'D YOU FIND OUT?

338
00:15:21,875 --> 00:15:23,625
- WHEN I REFUSED TO BUILD HER
A SUPER WEAPON,

339
00:15:23,667 --> 00:15:25,291
SHE THREATENED MY LIFE.

340
00:15:25,333 --> 00:15:27,458
- SHE THREATENED ME TOO,
AND SHE'S THREATENING ZAOFU.

341
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:28,875
AND IT TURNS OUT
SHE'S BEEN THREATENING VILLAGES

342
00:15:28,917 --> 00:15:30,208
THIS WHOLE TIME.

343
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:31,625
WE'VE GOT TO GET OUT OF HERE.

344
00:15:31,667 --> 00:15:34,333
- I COULDN'T AGREE MORE, KID.

345
00:15:43,834 --> 00:15:46,000
- WE HAVE AN UNEXPECTED GUEST.

346
00:15:46,041 --> 00:15:48,750
THE AVATAR IS HERE TO SEE YOU.

347
00:15:52,125 --> 00:15:54,709
- KORRA, IT'S SUCH AN HONOR
TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

348
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:57,542
THE LAST I HEARD, YOU WERE
STILL HEALING IN THE SOUTH POLE.

349
00:15:57,583 --> 00:16:00,041
- WELL,
I'M FEELING MUCH BETTER NOW.

350
00:16:00,083 --> 00:16:01,750
- THAT'S WONDERFUL NEWS.

351
00:16:01,792 --> 00:16:03,792
- I'M HERE TO ASK YOU
TO BACK DOWN.

352
00:16:03,834 --> 00:16:06,250
PLEASE,
TAKE YOUR ARMY AND LEAVE.

353
00:16:06,291 --> 00:16:10,333
- I THINK WE BOTH KNOW
THAT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN.

354
00:16:17,417 --> 00:16:19,583
- I CAN'T LET YOU TAKE ZAOFU.

355
00:16:19,625 --> 00:16:21,625
- LOOK, I WAS TASKED
WITH BRINGING STABILITY

356
00:16:21,667 --> 00:16:23,333
TO THE EARTH KINGDOM.

357
00:16:23,375 --> 00:16:25,500
ZAOFU IS THE LAST HOLDOUT.

358
00:16:25,542 --> 00:16:26,583
WHY SHOULD I TREAT IT
DIFFERENTLY

359
00:16:26,625 --> 00:16:28,041
THAN ANY OTHER STATE?

360
00:16:28,083 --> 00:16:30,166
- WHAT YOU'RE DOING ISN'T RIGHT.

361
00:16:30,208 --> 00:16:32,917
- I UNDERSTAND YOU'RE JUST
TRYING TO DO SU A FAVOR,

362
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:35,125
BUT YOU CAN'T COME TO ME
AS I'M ON THE VERGE

363
00:16:35,166 --> 00:16:38,208
OF REUNITING MY NATION
AND TELL ME TO STOP.

364
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:41,333
THE WORLD WAS DESCENDING
INTO CHAOS WHILE YOU WERE GONE.

365
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:44,709
IN ORDER TO FIX IT, I HAD
TO MAKE SOME TOUGH DECISIONS.

366
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:46,208
- I KNOW WHAT THAT'S LIKE.

367
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:47,667
I'VE HAD PLENTY OF PEOPLE
MAD AT ME

368
00:16:47,709 --> 00:16:49,166
ABOUT DECISIONS I'VE MADE.

369
00:16:49,208 --> 00:16:50,583
- EXACTLY.

370
00:16:50,625 --> 00:16:52,917
KORRA,
IF YOU REALLY WANT TO HELP,

371
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:56,333
GO BACK TO SU AND TRY TO TALK
SOME SENSE INTO HER.

372
00:16:56,375 --> 00:16:58,375
LET'S CALL A TEMPORARY TRUCE.

373
00:16:58,417 --> 00:17:00,750
I WON'T MAKE ANY MOVES
UNTIL YOU TALK TO HER

374
00:17:00,792 --> 00:17:02,208
AND GET BACK TO ME.

375
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:05,667
- MAYBE THAT WILL BE
FOR THE BEST.

376
00:17:05,709 --> 00:17:07,333
- HAVE YOU SEEN BOLIN?

377
00:17:07,375 --> 00:17:10,625
- HE CAME BY TO SEE VARRICK,
BUT WE TURNED HIM AWAY.

378
00:17:10,667 --> 00:17:12,542
- OPEN THE DOOR.

379
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:18,333
WE HAVE SOME FUGITIVES TO CATCH.

380
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:24,500
- OKAY, I SAY WE GO UP
AND AROUND THE MOUNTAINS

381
00:17:24,542 --> 00:17:25,917
AND SNEAK INTO ZAOFU
FROM THE REAR.

382
00:17:25,959 --> 00:17:27,458
- WE'RE NOT GOING TO ZAOFU.

383
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:28,917
THAT PLACE IS DOOMED.

384
00:17:28,959 --> 00:17:30,333
WE'VE GOT TO HEAD
TO REPUBLIC CITY.

385
00:17:30,375 --> 00:17:32,875
- WHAT? NO. NO, NO, NO.
WE'VE GOT TO HELP HERE.

386
00:17:32,917 --> 00:17:34,875
- WE'LL BE HELPING
BY WARNING THE WORLD

387
00:17:34,917 --> 00:17:37,583
ABOUT KUVIRA'S POTENTIAL
SUPER WEAPON.

388
00:17:37,625 --> 00:17:39,250
- WELL,
THAT IS HELPING,

389
00:17:39,291 --> 00:17:40,959
BUT IT'S A COMPLETELY
DIFFERENT TYPE OF HELPING.

390
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,834
HMM, LET ME THINK ABOUT THIS.

391
00:17:42,875 --> 00:17:44,917
AHH!

392
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:46,458
- ARGH!

393
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:47,875
- AHH!

394
00:17:50,917 --> 00:17:52,291
- ARGH!

395
00:17:52,333 --> 00:17:54,625
AHH! AHH!

396
00:17:59,166 --> 00:18:01,000
THAT'S NOT THE FLAMETHROWER.

397
00:18:01,041 --> 00:18:03,500
WHAT IDIOT DESIGNED
THESE THINGS?

398
00:18:03,542 --> 00:18:04,917
- YOU DID, SIR.

399
00:18:04,959 --> 00:18:07,208
- LESS LECTURING,
MORE SAVING MY LIFE.

400
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:08,917
- UGH!

401
00:18:08,959 --> 00:18:11,375
AHH!

402
00:18:11,417 --> 00:18:13,458
ARGH!

403
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,208
- OH!

404
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:16,834
- ARGH!

405
00:18:16,875 --> 00:18:19,875
- AHH!

406
00:18:19,917 --> 00:18:21,000
UGH.

407
00:18:23,041 --> 00:18:26,542
AHH!

408
00:18:26,583 --> 00:18:30,583
ARGH!

409
00:18:39,125 --> 00:18:40,125
ARGH!

410
00:18:40,166 --> 00:18:42,000
- HEY,
I THINK I FIGURED IT OUT.

411
00:18:44,208 --> 00:18:46,333
- AHH!

412
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:49,250
SIR, YOU'RE MAKING THIS
VERY DIFFICULT.

413
00:18:49,291 --> 00:18:51,125
AHH!

414
00:18:51,166 --> 00:18:54,125
- ARGH!

415
00:18:54,166 --> 00:18:55,917
YAH!

416
00:18:58,333 --> 00:19:01,000
- AUGH!

417
00:19:01,041 --> 00:19:04,375
- AHH!

418
00:19:04,417 --> 00:19:08,041
- ARGH!

419
00:19:13,458 --> 00:19:15,291
ARGH!

420
00:19:15,333 --> 00:19:16,458
- AUGH!

421
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,875
AHH!

422
00:19:22,083 --> 00:19:24,291
- AHH!

423
00:19:24,333 --> 00:19:25,875
AHH-AHH!

424
00:19:34,333 --> 00:19:36,208
ARGH!

425
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:37,625
- STOP.

426
00:19:37,667 --> 00:19:40,583
TURN YOURSELF OVER OR ELSE.

427
00:19:40,625 --> 00:19:42,875
- THANKS A LOT, ZHU LI.

428
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:52,750
- YOU CAME BACK.

429
00:19:52,792 --> 00:19:54,166
- WHEN I FIRST CAME HERE,

430
00:19:54,208 --> 00:19:56,333
IT WAS BECAUSE I WANTED
TO TELL YOU FACE-TO-FACE

431
00:19:56,375 --> 00:19:59,792
THAT I NEVER WANTED TO SEE
OR HEAR FROM YOU AGAIN.

432
00:19:59,834 --> 00:20:01,792
I WANTED MY WORDS TO HURT YOU,

433
00:20:01,834 --> 00:20:04,417
SO THAT YOU WOULD KNOW
HOW YOU HURT ME.

434
00:20:04,458 --> 00:20:05,959
- I'M SORRY.

435
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,375
- BUT WHEN I SAW YOU,
IT WASN'T ANGER I FELT.

436
00:20:09,417 --> 00:20:11,375
IT WAS SADNESS.

437
00:20:11,417 --> 00:20:14,917
YOU TAINTED OUR PAST AND
DESTROYED OUR FUTURE TOGETHER.

438
00:20:14,959 --> 00:20:16,583
- I WANT TO MAKE AMENDS.

439
00:20:16,625 --> 00:20:20,208
- I'M NOT SURE I'LL EVER BE ABLE
TO FORGIVE YOU,

440
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:24,333
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN
I SHOULDN'T TRY.

441
00:20:24,375 --> 00:20:27,375
I THOUGHT WE COULD PLAY
SOME PAI SHO,

442
00:20:27,417 --> 00:20:29,875
LIKE WE USED TO.

443
00:20:29,917 --> 00:20:32,542
- NOTHING WOULD MAKE ME HAPPIER.

444
00:20:39,667 --> 00:20:40,834
[together]
AUGH!

445
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:46,083
- DON'T TORTURE US.

446
00:20:46,125 --> 00:20:49,083
- SEND THESE THREE AWAY
ON THE NEXT TRAIN.

447
00:20:49,125 --> 00:20:52,375
BOLIN AND ZHU LI WILL BE GOING
TO THE REEDUCATION CAMP

448
00:20:52,417 --> 00:20:54,458
FOR OUR MOST SEVERE DISSENTERS.

449
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:57,792
AND YOU WILL CONTINUE WORK
ON THE SPIRIT ENERGY PROJECT

450
00:20:57,834 --> 00:21:00,875
UNDER CLOSE,
ARMED SUPERVISION.

451
00:21:00,917 --> 00:21:03,750
I WANT IT WEAPONIZED
IMMEDIATELY.

452
00:21:03,792 --> 00:21:06,000
- PLEASE,
HAVE MERCY ON ME.

453
00:21:06,041 --> 00:21:08,583
DON'T SEND ME AWAY.
TAKE ME BACK.

454
00:21:08,625 --> 00:21:10,542
- WHY WOULD I?

455
00:21:10,583 --> 00:21:14,166
- BECAUSE MY ONLY MISTAKE WAS
BEING LOYAL TO THE WRONG PERSON.

456
00:21:14,208 --> 00:21:16,166
I WAS BLINDLY DEVOTED
TO VARRICK,

457
00:21:16,208 --> 00:21:18,667
AND I LOOKED PAST ALL THE TIMES
HE RIDICULED ME

458
00:21:18,709 --> 00:21:22,750
OR ORDERED ME AROUND OR MADE ME
CLEAN HIS DISGUSTING FEET,

459
00:21:22,792 --> 00:21:25,417
BECAUSE I THOUGHT HE POSSESSED
THE MOST BRILLIANT MIND

460
00:21:25,458 --> 00:21:27,959
IN THE WORLD,
BUT WHEN I MET YOU,

461
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,875
I REALIZED I WAS WRONG.

462
00:21:29,917 --> 00:21:32,667
COMPARED TO YOU,
VARRICK'S A FOOL.

463
00:21:32,709 --> 00:21:34,375
- HEY, COME ON.
I'M RIGHT HERE.

464
00:21:34,417 --> 00:21:36,125
- I BELIEVE IN EVERYTHING
YOU'VE DONE,

465
00:21:36,166 --> 00:21:37,917
AND I BELIEVE IN YOUR VISION.

466
00:21:37,959 --> 00:21:40,625
I WANT TO DEVOTE MY LIFE TO YOU.

467
00:21:40,667 --> 00:21:45,417
I PLEDGE MY ALLEGIANCE TO YOU,
GREAT UNITER.

468
00:21:45,458 --> 00:21:47,792
- YOU TWO COULD LEARN SOMETHING
FROM HER.

469
00:21:47,834 --> 00:21:49,291
RISE, ZHU LI.

470
00:21:49,333 --> 00:21:50,959
I'LL GIVE YOU ANOTHER CHANCE.

471
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,834
- THINK ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

472
00:21:52,875 --> 00:21:54,500
WE'RE PARTNERS.

473
00:21:54,542 --> 00:21:55,959
WE HAVE HISTORY.

474
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,750
- I DID EVERYTHING
YOU EVER ASKED OF ME,

475
00:21:57,792 --> 00:21:59,500
AND YOU NEVER APPRECIATED IT.

476
00:21:59,542 --> 00:22:01,542
GUARDS, DO THE THING.

477
00:22:01,583 --> 00:22:04,250
- NO,
NOT THE THING.

478
00:22:04,291 --> 00:22:06,875
ZHU LI.

479
00:22:08,667 --> 00:22:10,041
- WHERE'S SU?
I HAVE TO TALK TO HER.

480
00:22:10,083 --> 00:22:11,375
- SHE'S NOT HERE.

481
00:22:11,417 --> 00:22:13,041
SHE TOOK WING AND WEI.

482
00:22:13,083 --> 00:22:15,000
THEY'RE GOING TO SNEAK INTO
KUVIRA'S CAMP

483
00:22:15,041 --> 00:22:16,417
AND PUT AN END TO THIS.

484
00:22:16,458 --> 00:22:18,458
- NO.
