1
00:00:07,406 --> 00:00:08,906
Earth.

2
00:00:08,908 --> 00:00:10,808
Fire.

3
00:00:10,810 --> 00:00:12,577
Air.

4
00:00:12,579 --> 00:00:13,778
Water.

5
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:18,016
Only the Avatar can
master all four elements

6
00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:20,152
and bring balance to the world.

7
00:00:25,791 --> 00:00:27,592
Korra is safely back in Republic City,

8
00:00:27,594 --> 00:00:30,361
but Bolin and Varrick are still on the lam.

9
00:00:30,363 --> 00:00:31,029
Weeks ago, Korra removed

10
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:32,463
the remaining poison from her body,

11
00:00:32,465 --> 00:00:35,500
but the memory of Zaheer's
attack still torments her.

12
00:00:35,502 --> 00:00:36,701
And after being defeated by Kuvira,

13
00:00:36,703 --> 00:00:39,637
she questions if she
will ever fully recover.

14
00:00:39,639 --> 00:00:40,605
Meanwhile, Kuvira has been

15
00:00:40,607 --> 00:00:43,274
secretly harvesting spirit
vines from the swamp.

16
00:00:43,276 --> 00:00:43,941
But how close is she

17
00:00:43,943 --> 00:00:46,154
to completing her spirit energy weapon?

18
00:00:51,950 --> 00:00:54,952
Everyone, mom, can we
stay together, please?

19
00:00:54,954 --> 00:00:56,454
The tour's about to begin.

20
00:00:56,456 --> 00:00:58,322
That's my boy... Ryu.

21
00:00:58,324 --> 00:00:59,390
He used to live in the basement,

22
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:01,492
but then he got airbending,
and he's been doing

23
00:01:01,494 --> 00:01:04,295
important air nation
stuff all over the world.

24
00:01:04,297 --> 00:01:06,364
His father and I are here visiting him,

25
00:01:06,366 --> 00:01:09,567
and we're just having the
best time in the big city.

26
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:12,070
We're so proud, right, honey?

27
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:14,372
At least he has a job now.

28
00:01:14,374 --> 00:01:17,475
Mom, dad, I'm trying to work.

29
00:01:18,343 --> 00:01:19,410
Fun fact, everyone:

30
00:01:19,412 --> 00:01:22,613
All these vines were created by Unavaatu

31
00:01:22,615 --> 00:01:24,816
when he battled giant spirit Korra

32
00:01:24,818 --> 00:01:28,086
for the fate of the world.

33
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:29,053
Excuse me.

34
00:01:29,055 --> 00:01:32,423
Are we in the spirit world right now?

35
00:01:32,425 --> 00:01:33,624
No.

36
00:01:33,626 --> 00:01:36,761
Is the spirit world in the ground below us?

37
00:01:36,763 --> 00:01:39,430
No, can I just get through my cards?

38
00:01:39,432 --> 00:01:41,933
Oh, honey, don't get flustered.

39
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:42,867
I'm not!

40
00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:46,437
Uh, why is that vine coming toward us?

41
00:01:47,073 --> 00:01:50,908
Uh, I don't see anything
about that on the cards.

42
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:53,444
I'm gonna poke it with a stick.

43
00:01:53,446 --> 00:01:55,646
No! Why would you do that?

44
00:02:00,587 --> 00:02:01,587
Ohh!

45
00:02:01,588 --> 00:02:03,621
Oh! Oh!

46
00:02:03,623 --> 00:02:04,989
Everyone back!

47
00:02:04,991 --> 00:02:07,992
This tour is exciting!

48
00:02:12,432 --> 00:02:14,699
Isn't he the best airbender ever...

49
00:02:18,371 --> 00:02:19,971
Ugh!

50
00:02:30,482 --> 00:02:31,983
Everything okay?

51
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:34,085
No, Kuvira has my family,

52
00:02:34,087 --> 00:02:36,654
and no one seems to care but me.

53
00:02:36,656 --> 00:02:37,455
We all care.

54
00:02:37,457 --> 00:02:40,091
Don't worry. We'll get them back safely.

55
00:02:40,093 --> 00:02:42,093
Guys, there you are!

56
00:02:42,095 --> 00:02:45,396
I just felt a weird
surge of spiritual energy

57
00:02:45,398 --> 00:02:47,532
coming from the spirit wilds.

58
00:02:47,534 --> 00:02:49,967
Something's wrong.

59
00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:53,704
Are you sure you felt a disturbance?

60
00:02:53,706 --> 00:02:56,474
Maybe you just had some
bad food for breakfast.

61
00:02:56,476 --> 00:02:58,042
I'm telling you. I felt it.

62
00:02:58,044 --> 00:03:00,945
Maybe something happened
to Ryu's tour group.

63
00:03:00,947 --> 00:03:03,414
We should've run into them by now.

64
00:03:03,416 --> 00:03:04,882
Yeah, but it's Ryu.

65
00:03:04,884 --> 00:03:06,851
They might be at the mall for all we know.

66
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:11,756
Korra, can't you feel
how strange the energy is?

67
00:03:11,758 --> 00:03:13,191
No, but...

68
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:16,027
Maybe I can get a reading.

69
00:03:32,912 --> 00:03:35,213
Korra, what is it? Are you okay?

70
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:36,215
It was Kuvira.

71
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:38,516
I saw her taking vines from the swamp.

72
00:03:38,518 --> 00:03:40,518
It must be affecting our spirit wilds.

73
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:43,087
I bet that's what you were sensing, Jinora.

74
00:03:43,089 --> 00:03:44,622
Why is she taking vines?

75
00:03:44,624 --> 00:03:47,925
Whatever the reason,
I'm sure it's not good.

76
00:03:47,927 --> 00:03:48,859
We have to tell Raiko.

77
00:03:48,861 --> 00:03:51,195
This might help him
convince the other leaders

78
00:03:51,197 --> 00:03:52,630
to finally take her down.

79
00:03:52,632 --> 00:03:55,900
I'll keep looking for Ryu and the others.

80
00:03:56,635 --> 00:04:00,238
I say we deal with this
Kuvira situation immediately.

81
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,038
Yes! Agreed!

82
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,540
And I know just how to get rid of her:

83
00:04:02,542 --> 00:04:05,476
We tell her she won an
all-expense-paid vacation

84
00:04:05,478 --> 00:04:06,677
to a tropical island.

85
00:04:06,679 --> 00:04:07,912
Then when she gets there,

86
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:09,213
we reveal it was a trap...

87
00:04:09,215 --> 00:04:10,581
the island's a prison!

88
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:12,250
Boom! Got her!

89
00:04:12,718 --> 00:04:15,786
Or, okay, uh, I'm just spitballing here.

90
00:04:15,788 --> 00:04:21,192
We march in with an army of
highly trained badgermoles!

91
00:04:22,594 --> 00:04:24,629
Do we know if Kuvira has any allergies?

92
00:04:24,631 --> 00:04:27,632
Look, I think we all
know what must be done.

93
00:04:27,634 --> 00:04:28,599
We take the fight to her.

94
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:30,668
I don't believe attacking
is the right move,

95
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:32,970
since she hasn't done anything aggressive

96
00:04:32,972 --> 00:04:34,972
toward the united Republic.

97
00:04:34,974 --> 00:04:35,740
Not yet.

98
00:04:35,742 --> 00:04:37,642
But Kuvira can't be trusted.

99
00:04:37,644 --> 00:04:38,175
She told us that

100
00:04:38,177 --> 00:04:40,044
she was going to turn over power,

101
00:04:40,046 --> 00:04:41,046
and she didn't.

102
00:04:41,047 --> 00:04:42,013
I'm with Raiko.

103
00:04:42,015 --> 00:04:43,247
I say we go on the offensive

104
00:04:43,249 --> 00:04:44,715
and start by retaking Zaofu.

105
00:04:44,717 --> 00:04:47,652
President Raiko, I'm
sorry to interrupt, but...

106
00:04:47,654 --> 00:04:48,853
what's going on here?

107
00:04:48,855 --> 00:04:50,888
Oh, hey, Avatar Korra.

108
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:52,290
Just kickin' it world leader style,

109
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:54,191
trying to figure out
what to do about Kuvira.

110
00:04:54,193 --> 00:04:58,729
For the record, I told Raiko
he should've invited you.

111
00:04:58,731 --> 00:05:00,731
You invited him but not me?

112
00:05:00,733 --> 00:05:03,668
Please, Korra, it's not personal.

113
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:04,568
We just thought perhaps

114
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:07,772
we called you back into
action a little too soon.

115
00:05:07,774 --> 00:05:09,940
Again... him, not me?

116
00:05:09,942 --> 00:05:11,742
Korra, we're in the middle of a meeting,

117
00:05:11,744 --> 00:05:13,778
and we can't have people just barge in

118
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:15,046
whenever they want!

119
00:05:15,048 --> 00:05:15,680
Guys!

120
00:05:15,682 --> 00:05:18,649
Oh, perfect! You're all here!

121
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:19,750
Bolin?

122
00:05:19,752 --> 00:05:20,785
What are you doing here?

123
00:05:20,787 --> 00:05:23,220
Guards, remove these traitors!

124
00:05:23,222 --> 00:05:24,155
No!

125
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:25,790
We escaped Kuvira's army!

126
00:05:25,792 --> 00:05:27,158
We're back on your side now!

127
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:31,962
We have top secret information for you!

128
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:38,135
Okay, I guess we should
have opened with that line.

129
00:05:38,137 --> 00:05:38,869
Listen to me.

130
00:05:38,871 --> 00:05:40,705
Kuvira is making this thing that goes...

131
00:05:42,909 --> 00:05:45,676
I don't know how it
works, but it has this...

132
00:05:46,245 --> 00:05:47,245
It's a super weapon!

133
00:05:47,246 --> 00:05:49,814
Like a regular weapon, only super!

134
00:05:49,816 --> 00:05:50,681
And let me guess.

135
00:05:50,683 --> 00:05:52,650
It has something to do with spirit vines.

136
00:05:52,652 --> 00:05:54,352
Yes! How did you know?

137
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:55,252
I saw a vision of her

138
00:05:55,254 --> 00:05:57,021
taking spirit vines from the swamp.

139
00:05:57,023 --> 00:06:00,191
If she figures out how
to harness their power,

140
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:01,193
we are all doomed.

141
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:03,961
She might use the weapon
to attack Republic City.

142
00:06:03,963 --> 00:06:05,863
The only way to protect ourselves

143
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:06,797
is with a preemptive strike.

144
00:06:06,799 --> 00:06:10,634
My airbenders won't be part
of an unprovoked attack.

145
00:06:10,636 --> 00:06:12,837
Neither will the fire nation.

146
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:14,038
But, Fire Lord Izumi,

147
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,773
Kuvira is a threat to the world.

148
00:06:15,775 --> 00:06:16,674
She has to be stopped!

149
00:06:16,676 --> 00:06:20,144
The fire nation has spent
too much of its history

150
00:06:20,146 --> 00:06:21,312
fighting nonsense wars,

151
00:06:21,314 --> 00:06:24,682
and I refuse to drag my
nation into another one

152
00:06:24,684 --> 00:06:26,050
unless there's no other choice.

153
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:31,789
If you attack Kuvira,
you'll do it without my army.

154
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:32,223
Fine.

155
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:34,191
I'll hold off any plans of attack.

156
00:06:34,193 --> 00:06:35,226
We'll go on the defensive

157
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:37,294
and fortify security on the borders.

158
00:06:37,296 --> 00:06:40,931
In that, you'll have my help.

159
00:06:41,967 --> 00:06:43,167
Opal, wait! Please.

160
00:06:43,169 --> 00:06:46,804
I just want to say that
I'm sorry for everything.

161
00:06:46,806 --> 00:06:48,005
I'm glad you're okay,

162
00:06:48,007 --> 00:06:50,274
but it's a little late for sorry.

163
00:06:50,276 --> 00:06:51,242
I know. I know.

164
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:52,376
I didn't listen to you,

165
00:06:52,378 --> 00:06:53,277
and I sided with Kuvira,

166
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:55,079
and I helped her take
over the earth kingdom

167
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:57,214
and topple your home
and get your mom captured

168
00:06:57,216 --> 00:06:59,316
and your brothers and your dad...

169
00:06:59,318 --> 00:07:00,751
Wow, that does sound really bad

170
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:02,019
when I say it out loud like that.

171
00:07:02,021 --> 00:07:03,788
But I'm gonna make it up to you.

172
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:04,889
Pardon me, lovebirds,

173
00:07:04,891 --> 00:07:08,192
but I need a word with Opal.

174
00:07:08,194 --> 00:07:09,194
Privately.

175
00:07:09,195 --> 00:07:12,263
I'm sorry, kid, but Raiko couldn't convince

176
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:15,065
the other leaders to attack Kuvira.

177
00:07:15,067 --> 00:07:15,933
So our family...

178
00:07:15,935 --> 00:07:18,402
Looks like we're going to
have to save them ourselves.

179
00:07:18,404 --> 00:07:20,304
Don't you think some other people

180
00:07:20,306 --> 00:07:21,739
would agree to go with us?

181
00:07:21,741 --> 00:07:23,808
This is an unsanctioned

182
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:24,975
and dangerous mission

183
00:07:24,977 --> 00:07:26,177
into enemy territory.

184
00:07:26,179 --> 00:07:27,344
We can't ask other people

185
00:07:27,346 --> 00:07:29,847
to risk their necks for our family.

186
00:07:29,849 --> 00:07:31,182
If we want to break them out,

187
00:07:31,184 --> 00:07:34,118
we'll have to do it alone.

188
00:07:34,252 --> 00:07:36,353
Bolin, I'm so glad you're back.

189
00:07:36,355 --> 00:07:38,155
I was worried about you.

190
00:07:38,157 --> 00:07:40,724
We all were.

191
00:07:40,726 --> 00:07:41,258
Thanks, guys.

192
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:44,895
Mako, I'm so sorry about
the way we left things.

193
00:07:44,897 --> 00:07:46,263
I'm such an idiot.

194
00:07:46,265 --> 00:07:48,132
You tried to warn me about Kuvira,

195
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:50,100
and I ran off anyway, like an idiot.

196
00:07:50,102 --> 00:07:52,870
You were right, and I'm just an idiot.

197
00:07:52,872 --> 00:07:56,207
I hope that I'll be able
to earn your trust again.

198
00:07:56,209 --> 00:08:00,077
If anyone has lost people's trust, it's me.

199
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:02,112
Ever since Kuvira kicked my butt,

200
00:08:02,114 --> 00:08:04,081
no one even wants me around.

201
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:05,049
We want you around.

202
00:08:05,051 --> 00:08:07,351
And, Bolin, you're not an idiot.

203
00:08:07,353 --> 00:08:10,187
You were just doing what
you thought was right.

204
00:08:10,189 --> 00:08:12,423
Aw, I love you guys.

205
00:08:12,425 --> 00:08:15,459
And I really want to hug again.

206
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:46,457
Agh!

207
00:08:49,928 --> 00:08:51,929
Ugh!

208
00:08:51,931 --> 00:08:53,364
Ah!

209
00:08:58,370 --> 00:08:59,904
Korra! The vines!

210
00:08:59,906 --> 00:09:01,372
They're taking me!

211
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:03,541
Help!

212
00:09:07,946 --> 00:09:09,146
Get everyone out of here!

213
00:09:09,148 --> 00:09:10,347
Put up a perimeter.

214
00:09:10,349 --> 00:09:11,215
Cancel all tours.

215
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:13,150
Somebody get ahold of Tenzin.

216
00:09:13,152 --> 00:09:14,418
We got to get in there and find Jinora.

217
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:17,221
I don't think anyone should
be going in there right now.

218
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:20,024
I know I'm not the old Avatar I used to be,

219
00:09:20,026 --> 00:09:22,026
but I can do this.

220
00:09:27,532 --> 00:09:29,633
Be careful.

221
00:09:30,936 --> 00:09:32,002
Jinora!

222
00:09:32,004 --> 00:09:33,904
Hello? Anyone?

223
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,941
Wait. Do you hear that?

224
00:09:42,982 --> 00:09:44,481
Oh! Oh!

225
00:09:47,419 --> 00:09:49,320
Come on!

226
00:09:56,629 --> 00:09:58,228
Korra, look.

227
00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:00,631
What are those?

228
00:10:12,143 --> 00:10:13,911
It's Jinora and the rest of them.

229
00:10:13,913 --> 00:10:16,580
Their spirits are trapped
in the spirit world.

230
00:10:16,582 --> 00:10:18,582
Let's get them out.

231
00:10:18,584 --> 00:10:19,316
Don't!

232
00:10:19,318 --> 00:10:21,318
You'll provoke the vines.

233
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:23,988
Let me try.

234
00:10:39,405 --> 00:10:40,270
They won't open.

235
00:10:40,272 --> 00:10:43,273
Maybe if I meditate into the spirit world,

236
00:10:43,275 --> 00:10:44,975
I can free them.

237
00:10:57,122 --> 00:10:57,588
Wait...

238
00:10:57,590 --> 00:10:59,657
This isn't the spirit world.

239
00:11:04,729 --> 00:11:05,729
Zaheer!

240
00:11:05,731 --> 00:11:07,131
No!

241
00:11:17,543 --> 00:11:20,411
You can't fight me and the poison.

242
00:11:20,413 --> 00:11:22,246
No, I got it out.

243
00:11:22,248 --> 00:11:25,416
You'll never get it out!

244
00:11:32,424 --> 00:11:35,526
Korra, what's wrong?

245
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:36,560
It's Zaheer.

246
00:11:36,562 --> 00:11:37,561
What are you talking about?

247
00:11:37,563 --> 00:11:40,264
He's been haunting me
ever since I fought him.

248
00:11:40,266 --> 00:11:42,132
I can't get any peace.

249
00:11:42,134 --> 00:11:43,701
It's like he's blocking me

250
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:46,203
from meditating into the spirit world.

251
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:47,304
I'm here for you.

252
00:11:47,306 --> 00:11:49,139
What do you need?

253
00:11:49,141 --> 00:11:50,441
I want to face Zaheer.

254
00:11:50,443 --> 00:11:52,076
Korra, he's too dangerous.

255
00:11:52,078 --> 00:11:55,012
Even when he's locked
up, he can't be trusted.

256
00:11:55,014 --> 00:11:56,547
I need to if I want to save Jinora

257
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:59,083
and the others; There's no other way.

258
00:11:59,085 --> 00:12:00,217
There is another way.

259
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:01,151
I'm calling your father.

260
00:12:01,153 --> 00:12:03,620
He can lead an expedition
into the spirit world

261
00:12:03,622 --> 00:12:04,622
from the Southern portal.

262
00:12:04,623 --> 00:12:07,491
You've lost faith in me too, haven't you?

263
00:12:07,493 --> 00:12:10,594
No one thinks I'm capable
of anything anymore.

264
00:12:10,596 --> 00:12:12,196
It's not that at all.

265
00:12:12,198 --> 00:12:13,564
I know I can do this.

266
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:15,666
I'm just so worried for Jinora.

267
00:12:15,668 --> 00:12:19,069
I can't imagine if something
happened to you too.

268
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:21,038
Tenzin, please...

269
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,240
I'll be okay.

270
00:12:23,374 --> 00:12:26,076
Zaheer's imprisoned deep in the mountains

271
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:26,744
outside the city.

272
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:29,379
I'll call Raiko and get the clearance.

273
00:12:29,381 --> 00:12:31,281
Thank you.

274
00:12:34,319 --> 00:12:37,121
Pab-pabs, where are you?

275
00:12:40,526 --> 00:12:42,526
Pabu!

276
00:12:42,528 --> 00:12:45,129
Oh, I missed you so much!

277
00:12:45,131 --> 00:12:46,764
So I don't know if you've heard,

278
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:48,332
but Opal's kind of mad at me.

279
00:12:48,334 --> 00:12:52,102
I was hoping you could
help me win her back.

280
00:12:53,239 --> 00:12:55,439
Awesome! Yes, I have an idea.

281
00:13:00,312 --> 00:13:01,612
Hello, Pabu.

282
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:03,847
Well, it's good to see you too.

283
00:13:03,849 --> 00:13:06,483
What do you got there?

284
00:13:14,292 --> 00:13:15,492
Opal, you made it.

285
00:13:15,494 --> 00:13:16,494
What's this?

286
00:13:16,495 --> 00:13:18,228
A picnic, just for the two of us.

287
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:19,863
Well, three of us. Sorry, pabs.

288
00:13:19,865 --> 00:13:21,732
So this note Pabu brought me

289
00:13:21,734 --> 00:13:23,867
saying you broke both of your legs

290
00:13:23,869 --> 00:13:25,369
was just a ruse?

291
00:13:25,371 --> 00:13:26,371
Maybe...

292
00:13:26,372 --> 00:13:27,437
But now that you're here,

293
00:13:27,439 --> 00:13:29,239
don't you want to just sit back, relax,

294
00:13:29,241 --> 00:13:31,508
try some of my homemade steam buns...

295
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:32,342
Pema's recipe...

296
00:13:32,344 --> 00:13:33,644
and watch Pabu do some of his

297
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:36,880
world famous backflips for entertainment?

298
00:13:36,882 --> 00:13:38,115
Ha-ha!

299
00:13:38,117 --> 00:13:40,717
Oh, steam buns... my favorite.

300
00:13:40,719 --> 00:13:44,488
This will totally make me forget
that you worked for Kuvira,

301
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:46,223
the person who captured my family

302
00:13:46,225 --> 00:13:48,692
and is probably torturing them right now.

303
00:13:48,694 --> 00:13:50,294
So, yeah, let's just sit down

304
00:13:50,296 --> 00:13:55,199
and have a great picnic
because we're so in love!

305
00:13:55,667 --> 00:13:59,236
I'm sorry you had to see that, Pabu.

306
00:14:02,273 --> 00:14:03,340
Thank you both for coming.

307
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:06,577
It's nice to be welcomed
back with open arms.

308
00:14:06,579 --> 00:14:09,913
Actually, I brought you
here out of necessity.

309
00:14:09,915 --> 00:14:11,682
It's no secret I never liked you,

310
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:14,785
especially after you
tried to have me kidnapped.

311
00:14:14,787 --> 00:14:15,752
Allegedly.

312
00:14:15,754 --> 00:14:17,387
Right.

313
00:14:17,389 --> 00:14:20,224
Everything you do is "allegedly,"

314
00:14:20,226 --> 00:14:21,425
like when you took over my company

315
00:14:21,427 --> 00:14:24,828
and bombed the Southern
water tribe cultural center.

316
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:25,762
I own that building!

317
00:14:25,764 --> 00:14:27,898
A man has the right to
blow up his own property!

318
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:30,934
Right now, I need you to
put aside your differences.

319
00:14:30,936 --> 00:14:33,670
If Kuvira really is
creating a super weapon,

320
00:14:33,672 --> 00:14:35,505
we're going to need the two brightest minds

321
00:14:35,507 --> 00:14:37,875
in the city working together to stop it.

322
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:39,810
What do you say, Asami?

323
00:14:39,812 --> 00:14:41,745
Partners again?

324
00:14:41,747 --> 00:14:43,347
Fine. I'll help.

325
00:14:43,349 --> 00:14:47,451
But don't even think about
double-crossing me again.

326
00:14:47,453 --> 00:14:51,288
Ow... Uh-huh.

327
00:15:02,635 --> 00:15:05,702
Are you sure you're ready for this?

328
00:15:05,704 --> 00:15:06,803
Yes.

329
00:15:06,805 --> 00:15:08,572
I think if I see Zaheer chained up,

330
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:12,576
I'll finally realize that
he's not a threat anymore.

331
00:15:34,933 --> 00:15:37,367
Approach the wall.

332
00:15:37,369 --> 00:15:38,302
No.

333
00:15:38,304 --> 00:15:40,837
I need to do this alone.

334
00:16:03,761 --> 00:16:07,631
I figured you would
show up sooner or later.

335
00:16:12,070 --> 00:16:12,970
So...

336
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:14,004
You must really be in trouble

337
00:16:14,006 --> 00:16:16,773
if you came all the
way down here to see me.

338
00:16:16,775 --> 00:16:18,809
I came here to look you in the eye

339
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:21,745
and tell you that you
have no power over me.

340
00:16:21,747 --> 00:16:25,115
I will no longer be scared of you.

341
00:16:31,523 --> 00:16:33,390
I guess it didn't work.

342
00:16:33,392 --> 00:16:35,425
You still seem scared.

343
00:16:35,427 --> 00:16:37,928
This was a mistake.

344
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:38,962
I know why you're here.

345
00:16:38,964 --> 00:16:40,864
You don't know anything about me!

346
00:16:40,866 --> 00:16:44,835
You can't go into the spirit world.

347
00:16:45,370 --> 00:16:47,037
I spend most of my time
in the spirit world,

348
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:49,639
and it's well-known
that the Avatar's spirit

349
00:16:49,641 --> 00:16:51,441
hasn't been there for a few years.

350
00:16:51,443 --> 00:16:54,845
You can meditate into the
spirit world from here?

351
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:58,048
Doesn't feel very spiritually charged.

352
00:16:58,050 --> 00:16:59,050
This is your problem.

353
00:16:59,051 --> 00:17:02,052
Republic City is flowing
with spiritual energy,

354
00:17:02,054 --> 00:17:04,054
and you can't even tap into it.

355
00:17:04,056 --> 00:17:07,057
No, my problem is you.

356
00:17:07,059 --> 00:17:09,026
You poisoned me!

357
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:09,760
You ruined me!

358
00:17:09,762 --> 00:17:11,628
People used to think I was unstoppable,

359
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:14,664
but now they don't think
I'm capable of anything!

360
00:17:14,666 --> 00:17:17,000
Blaming me is a crutch
to make you feel better,

361
00:17:17,002 --> 00:17:19,069
but it's not helping you recover.

362
00:17:19,071 --> 00:17:20,771
I thought seeing
you face-to-face

363
00:17:20,773 --> 00:17:22,172
would put an end to all of this,

364
00:17:22,174 --> 00:17:26,009
but maybe it's time I realize
I'll never be the same.

365
00:17:26,011 --> 00:17:27,811
Neither of us are the same as before.

366
00:17:27,813 --> 00:17:30,447
I learned to fly, but
now I'm bound in chains.

367
00:17:30,449 --> 00:17:32,049
You have all the power in the world

368
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:33,083
and the freedom to use it,

369
00:17:33,085 --> 00:17:35,085
but you choose to hold yourself down.

370
00:17:35,087 --> 00:17:37,421
I'm not holding myself down,

371
00:17:37,423 --> 00:17:39,122
but my powers have limits.

372
00:17:39,124 --> 00:17:39,956
You're wrong.

373
00:17:39,958 --> 00:17:41,958
That poison should've killed you,

374
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,794
but you were able to fight it off.

375
00:17:43,796 --> 00:17:46,029
You think your power has limits;

376
00:17:46,031 --> 00:17:48,165
I say it's limitless.

377
00:17:48,167 --> 00:17:48,932
Whatever.

378
00:17:48,934 --> 00:17:51,935
Before, you were always
talking about chaos and freedom.

379
00:17:51,937 --> 00:17:53,537
Then you took out the earth queen

380
00:17:53,539 --> 00:17:54,638
and created the worst dictator

381
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,807
the earth kingdom has ever seen.

382
00:17:56,809 --> 00:17:59,609
Thanks for that.

383
00:17:59,611 --> 00:18:00,877
I've heard rumors about her,

384
00:18:00,879 --> 00:18:04,047
but I didn't know she
achieved so much power.

385
00:18:04,049 --> 00:18:05,015
She needs to be stopped.

386
00:18:05,017 --> 00:18:09,186
Well, I can't stop her
unless I get over this block.

387
00:18:09,188 --> 00:18:10,120
I think I can help.

388
00:18:10,122 --> 00:18:13,223
Let me lead you into the spirit world.

389
00:18:13,225 --> 00:18:14,191
No way.

390
00:18:14,193 --> 00:18:15,826
I can't trust you.

391
00:18:15,828 --> 00:18:16,693
Maybe not.

392
00:18:16,695 --> 00:18:17,894
But if you had any other options,

393
00:18:17,896 --> 00:18:20,230
you wouldn't be here now, would you?

394
00:18:20,232 --> 00:18:21,998
We may have been enemies once,

395
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,769
but for now, our interests align.

396
00:18:30,241 --> 00:18:32,042
I've come this far.

397
00:18:32,044 --> 00:18:34,478
What have I got to lose?

398
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:40,984
Focus on the sound of my voice,

399
00:18:40,986 --> 00:18:43,720
and clear your mind.

400
00:18:57,603 --> 00:18:59,669
Let it play out.

401
00:18:59,671 --> 00:19:01,071
I can't!

402
00:19:01,073 --> 00:19:01,938
You can.

403
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:03,206
Accept what happened to you.

404
00:19:03,208 --> 00:19:05,609
Don't fear what might have been.

405
00:19:05,611 --> 00:19:06,910
I have no control!

406
00:19:06,912 --> 00:19:08,745
Don't be afraid.

407
00:19:08,747 --> 00:19:09,813
Hold on.

408
00:19:17,722 --> 00:19:19,156
I made it...

409
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:20,957
And you led me here.

410
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:23,693
Do you know where Jinora
and the others are?

411
00:19:23,695 --> 00:19:26,730
No, but you do.

412
00:19:33,037 --> 00:19:35,305
Raava, I missed you.

413
00:19:35,307 --> 00:19:36,206
Where have you been?

414
00:19:36,208 --> 00:19:39,943
I have always been inside of you.

415
00:19:39,945 --> 00:19:42,946
Can you help me find Jinora?

416
00:19:55,193 --> 00:19:57,060
How do I release their spirits?

417
00:19:57,062 --> 00:19:59,329
You must bend the energy within.

418
00:19:59,331 --> 00:20:01,665
But I'm powerless in the spirit world.

419
00:20:01,667 --> 00:20:04,768
No. You're most powerful here.

420
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:05,735
In the spirit world,

421
00:20:05,737 --> 00:20:10,006
you're connected to all
the spiritual energy.

422
00:20:51,949 --> 00:20:52,849
Uh...

423
00:20:52,851 --> 00:20:55,252
I feel all spirity.

424
00:20:58,824 --> 00:21:00,790
Dad!

425
00:21:00,992 --> 00:21:03,026
I'm so glad you're safe.

426
00:21:03,028 --> 00:21:04,028
What happened?

427
00:21:04,029 --> 00:21:05,228
How did you get out?

428
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:07,797
Korra saved us.

429
00:21:10,968 --> 00:21:11,901
So...

430
00:21:11,903 --> 00:21:13,169
How are you doing?

431
00:21:13,171 --> 00:21:16,039
I feel whole again.

432
00:21:16,041 --> 00:21:16,806
I feel good.

433
00:21:16,808 --> 00:21:18,241
Do you think you're finally able

434
00:21:18,243 --> 00:21:21,011
to forget about what Zaheer did to you?

435
00:21:21,013 --> 00:21:21,745
No.

436
00:21:21,747 --> 00:21:24,714
But I am finally able
to accept what happened,

437
00:21:24,716 --> 00:21:28,151
and I think that's gonna make me stronger.

438
00:21:32,156 --> 00:21:33,390
Where are you going?

439
00:21:33,392 --> 00:21:36,126
We've got some family
business to take care of.

440
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:38,061
All right, listen, before you go,

441
00:21:38,063 --> 00:21:40,297
I just want to tell you that
I understand how you feel.

442
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:41,831
I know there's nothing I could do

443
00:21:41,833 --> 00:21:44,734
or no big gesture that can
make up for all my mistakes,

444
00:21:44,736 --> 00:21:45,902
but that doesn't mean

445
00:21:45,904 --> 00:21:48,872
I'm gonna stop trying to win you back,

446
00:21:48,874 --> 00:21:50,840
because...

447
00:21:50,842 --> 00:21:52,842
I love you.

448
00:21:53,177 --> 00:21:56,146
Thanks for saying all of that.

449
00:21:56,347 --> 00:22:00,083
You know, there is one thing
you could do to win me back.

450
00:22:00,085 --> 00:22:02,419
What is it? Yes, I'll do anything!

451
00:22:02,421 --> 00:22:05,055
Come on a secret mission with us.

452
00:22:05,057 --> 00:22:06,389
- Where to?
- Zaofu.

453
00:22:06,391 --> 00:22:08,905
We're going to rescue my family.
