[bell dings]

349
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:38,917
- [grunts]

350
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:40,959
- [grunts]

351
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,667
- NOT SURE WHAT'S EATIN' THEM,

352
00:13:42,709 --> 00:13:46,583
BUT THIS IS NOT THE SAME TEAM
WHO TOOK OUT THE RABBAROOS.

353
00:13:46,625 --> 00:13:48,750
[buzzer rings]
- ROUND THREE IS A TIE.

354
00:13:48,792 --> 00:13:51,208
WE GO TO A TIE BREAKER
TO DECIDE THE MATCH.

355
00:13:55,166 --> 00:13:57,834
- THE FIRE FERRETS
WIN THE COIN TOSS.

356
00:13:57,875 --> 00:13:59,667
WHICH ELEMENT DO YOU CHOOSE?

357
00:13:59,709 --> 00:14:00,875
- I GOT THIS.

358
00:14:00,917 --> 00:14:02,458
- I KNOW YOU USUALLY
HANDLE THESE,

359
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:04,500
BUT FRANKLY,
YOUR HEAD'S NOT IN THE GAME.

360
00:14:04,542 --> 00:14:06,583
I'M GOING TO TAKE THIS ONE.

361
00:14:06,625 --> 00:14:10,417
WE CHOOSE EARTH.

362
00:14:10,458 --> 00:14:12,291
- LOOKS LIKE THE EARTH BENDERS
WILL COLLIDE

363
00:14:12,333 --> 00:14:15,750
IN THE TIE BREAKER FACE-OFF.

364
00:14:15,792 --> 00:14:16,709
[bell dings]

365
00:14:23,917 --> 00:14:26,250
BOLIN GOES IN FOR THE GRAPPLE.

366
00:14:26,291 --> 00:14:28,875
CHANG REVERSES.

367
00:14:28,917 --> 00:14:30,208
BOLIN STRIKES FROM MIDAIR,

368
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:32,875
KNOCKING CHANG
TO THE EDGE OF THE CIRCLE.

369
00:14:32,917 --> 00:14:35,250
ANOTHER STRIKE FROM BOLIN,
AND CHANG'S IN THE DRINK!

370
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:36,417
[bell dings]

371
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:38,709
- THE FUTURE INDUSTRIES
FIRE FERRETS

372
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:41,500
WIN THEIR
QUARTERFINAL MATCH!

373
00:14:41,542 --> 00:14:43,709
OOH, THAT WAS
A CLOSE ONE, FOLKS.

374
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:46,583
YOUTH TRUMPS EXPERIENCE
TONIGHT.

375
00:14:51,417 --> 00:14:52,709
- WE NEED TO TALK.

376
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:55,542
LOOK, SOMETIMES YOU CAN BE
SO INFURIATING.

377
00:14:55,583 --> 00:14:57,166
- SAVE YOUR BREATH.

378
00:14:57,208 --> 00:14:59,166
YOU'VE ALREADY MADE IT CLEAR
HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT ME.

379
00:14:59,208 --> 00:15:01,250
- NO, I HAVEN'T.

380
00:15:01,291 --> 00:15:04,375
WHAT I'M TRYING TO SAY IS
AS MUCH AS YOU DRIVE ME CRAZY,

381
00:15:04,417 --> 00:15:07,709
I ALSO THINK
YOU'RE PRETTY AMAZING.

382
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:09,917
- SO YOU DO LIKE ME?

383
00:15:09,959 --> 00:15:10,917
- YES, BUT--

384
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:13,333
[sighs]
I LIKE ASAMI, TOO.

385
00:15:13,375 --> 00:15:15,083
I DON'T KNOW,
THINGS ARE COMPLICATED.

386
00:15:15,125 --> 00:15:17,458
I'VE BEEN FEELING
REALLY CONFUSED--

387
00:15:34,709 --> 00:15:37,667
- [sobbing]

388
00:15:37,709 --> 00:15:40,041
- BOLIN, THIS ISN'T
WHAT YOU THINK.

389
00:15:40,083 --> 00:15:42,166
- [sobbing]

390
00:15:42,208 --> 00:15:44,125
- GREAT!
LOOK WHAT YOU DID.

391
00:15:44,166 --> 00:15:45,583
- YOU'RE BLAMING ME?

392
00:15:45,625 --> 00:15:48,250
- YOU KISSED ME!
- YOU KISSED ME BACK!

393
00:15:48,291 --> 00:15:50,250
- UUHHH!

394
00:15:51,792 --> 00:15:54,417
- WELL PLAYED, KORRA.

395
00:15:58,583 --> 00:15:59,667
- MORNING, NAROOK.

396
00:15:59,709 --> 00:16:01,667
IS MY BROTHER HERE?

397
00:16:01,709 --> 00:16:03,583
THANKS.

398
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,291
COME ON, WAKE UP.

399
00:16:07,333 --> 00:16:08,834
I'M TAKING YOU
HOME, BRO.

400
00:16:08,875 --> 00:16:10,750
- [sniffles]

401
00:16:10,792 --> 00:16:12,583
DON'T CALL ME THAT.

402
00:16:12,625 --> 00:16:14,458
YOU'RE NOT MY BROTHER.

403
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:16,291
YOU'RE A BROTHER-BETRAYER.

404
00:16:16,333 --> 00:16:18,041
[sobs]

405
00:16:18,083 --> 00:16:22,375
THE ONLY ONE I CAN
TRUST ANYMORE IS PABU.

406
00:16:22,417 --> 00:16:25,917
PABU LOVES ME.
[Pabu chittering]

407
00:16:25,959 --> 00:16:27,291
- YOU'RE A MESS,

408
00:16:27,333 --> 00:16:28,250
AND WE'VE GOT
THE BIGGEST MATCH

409
00:16:28,291 --> 00:16:29,250
OF OUR LIVES TONIGHT.

410
00:16:29,291 --> 00:16:31,500
LET'S GO.
- NO!

411
00:16:31,542 --> 00:16:34,917
I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE
WITH YOU, YOU TRAITOR.

412
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:36,625
- GUESS WE'LL HAVE TO DO THIS
THE HARD WAY.

413
00:16:36,667 --> 00:16:38,291
- [sobbing]

414
00:16:38,333 --> 00:16:41,083
WHY?

415
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:43,667
- I TOLD YOU DATING
A TEAMMATE WAS A BAD IDEA.

416
00:16:43,709 --> 00:16:46,166
- YOU'RE A BAD IDEA.

417
00:16:46,208 --> 00:16:48,458
[sobbing]
PUT ME DOWN.

418
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,417
PUT ME DOWN.
[Pabu chattering]

419
00:17:12,125 --> 00:17:15,208
- YOU CAN'T FIND TWO TEAMS
MORE EVENLY MATCHED

420
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:18,000
IN AGE, SIZE, AND STRENGTH
THAN THE FIRE FERRETS

421
00:17:18,041 --> 00:17:19,667
AND THE BUZZARD-WASPS.

422
00:17:19,709 --> 00:17:21,583
BELIEVE ME, I'VE LOOKED.

423
00:17:21,625 --> 00:17:23,667
THIS SHOULD BE
A PULSE-POUNDING SEMIFINAL,

424
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:24,917
FOLKS.

425
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:25,625
[bell dings]

426
00:17:28,875 --> 00:17:31,583

428
00:17:33,125 --> 00:17:35,542
- ALL THREE FERRETS
TAKE AN EARLY VISIT TO ZONE TWO.

429
00:17:35,583 --> 00:17:38,291
AND MAKO'S KNOCKED ALL THE WAY
BACK INTO ZONE THREE!

430
00:17:38,333 --> 00:17:39,750
THE FIRE FERRETS
HAVE BEEN STRUGGLING

431
00:17:39,792 --> 00:17:41,875
TO STAY ALIVE
SINCE THE OPENING BELL.

432
00:17:41,917 --> 00:17:44,417
ALL THREE PLAYERS ARE TOTALLY
OUT OF SYNC TONIGHT.

433

- [groans]
[buzzer rings]

TO STING!

- [Bolin vomits]

436
00:17:52,417 --> 00:17:55,041
- AND BOLIN LOSES HIS NOODLES.
LITERALLY.

437
00:17:55,083 --> 00:17:57,333
WHICH REMINDS ME,
THIS MATCH IS BROUGHT TO YOU

438
00:17:57,375 --> 00:18:00,542

FLAMEY-O INSTANT NOODLES.

- [groans]
[buzzer rings]

441
00:18:08,041 --> 00:18:12,709
- THE BUZZARD-WASPS FLY DEEPER
INTO FERRET TERRITORY.

442

- [groans]
[buzzer rings]

443
00:18:16,083 --> 00:18:18,375
- AND MAKO PLUNGES
INTO THE POOL.

444
00:18:18,417 --> 00:18:20,875
CAN THE FIRE FERRETS
HOLD ON?

445
00:18:20,917 --> 00:18:23,917
THE WASPS HAVE THE FERRETS
BACKED UP TO THE EDGE NOW.

446
00:18:23,959 --> 00:18:25,125
[bell rings]

447
00:18:25,166 --> 00:18:27,959
AND THE FERRETS
ARE BAILED OUT BY THE BELL.

448
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,625
THEY HAD BETTER PULL THEMSELVES
TOGETHER, FOLKS, FOR ROUND TWO.

449
00:18:30,667 --> 00:18:33,542
OTHERWISE THEY CAN KISS
THE FINALS GOOD-BYE.

450
00:18:33,583 --> 00:18:34,291
[bell dings]

451
00:18:38,625 --> 00:18:40,417

HEY!
WATCH IT!

454
00:18:44,792 --> 00:18:46,375
- THE WASPS TAKE ADVANTAGE
OF MAKO'S UNFORCED ERROR,

455
00:18:46,417 --> 00:18:49,625
AND BOLIN'S IN THE POOL!

456

[water attack splashing]

457
00:18:50,792 --> 00:18:52,083
- AHH!

458
00:18:52,125 --> 00:18:54,375
- OOH, AND A BLATANT HOLD
BY THE AVATAR.

- [blows whistle]
UNNECESSARY ROUGHNESS!

460
00:18:56,291 --> 00:18:58,125
MOVE BACK ONE ZONE!

00:18:58,166 --> 00:19:00,208
- I'LL UNNECESSARILY
ROUGH YOU UP!

462
00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:01,709
[water attack splashes]

463
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:05,041
- AND THE AVATAR IS SLAPPED
WITH A YELLOW FAN.

464
00:19:05,083 --> 00:19:07,125
THE FERRETS ARE THEIR
OWN WORST ENEMY RIGHT NOW.

465
00:19:07,166 --> 00:19:09,458
IT'S JUST SAD
TO WATCH.

466
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:11,750
WITH THE BUZZARD-WASPS LEADING
TWO ROUNDS TO ZILCH,

467
00:19:11,792 --> 00:19:12,792
THE FERRETS'
ONLY HOPE OF WINNING

468
00:19:12,834 --> 00:19:14,166
IS WITH A KNOCKOUT.

469
00:19:14,208 --> 00:19:15,750
- WELL, I GUESS
THERE'S ALWAYS NEXT YEAR.

470
00:19:15,792 --> 00:19:17,208
- COME ON,
WE STILL HAVE A CHANCE,

471
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:18,333
EVEN IF IT IS
A SLIM ONE.

472
00:19:18,375 --> 00:19:19,792
- THE WAY WE'RE PLAYING,

473
00:19:19,834 --> 00:19:22,375
WE DON'T EVEN DESERVE
TO BE IN THE FINALS.

474
00:19:22,417 --> 00:19:25,291
- LOOK, IF WE DON'T PULL
TOGETHER AND WORK AS A TEAM,

475
00:19:25,333 --> 00:19:26,834
WE'LL NEVER FORGIVE OURSELVES.

476
00:19:26,875 --> 00:19:28,166
- LET'S JUST GET THIS
OVER WITH.

477
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:32,208
- THE SOONER THE BETTER.

478
00:19:33,875 --> 00:19:34,834
[bell dings]

- BOLIN'S KNOCKED
INTO ZONE TWO,

483
00:19:43,041 --> 00:19:46,667
FOLLOWED QUICKLY
BY HIS BROTHER.

484
00:19:48,041 --> 00:19:49,542
- [screams]

485
00:19:49,583 --> 00:19:51,041
- AND BOLIN TAKES A ZINGER
TO THE SHOULDER.

486
00:19:51,083 --> 00:19:51,959
LOOKS LIKE
IT'S A CLEAN HIT.

487
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,583
- OW!

488
00:19:54,625 --> 00:19:55,750
- BOLIN!
[buzzer rings]

489
00:19:55,792 --> 00:19:57,417
- [screams]

490
00:19:57,458 --> 00:19:58,917
- MAKO'S IN THE DRINK
AND OUT OF THE MATCH.

491
00:19:58,959 --> 00:20:01,625
AND BOLIN KEEPS PLAYING
WITH ONE GOOD ARM!

492
00:20:01,667 --> 00:20:03,792
I GOTTA HAND IT TO HIM,
THIS KID'S GOT GRIT,

493
00:20:03,834 --> 00:20:05,166
BUT HOW LONG
CAN HE KEEP IT UP?

494
00:20:05,208 --> 00:20:06,166
- AH!
[buzzer rings]

495
00:20:06,208 --> 00:20:08,542
- APPARENTLY, NOT VERY LONG.

496
00:20:08,583 --> 00:20:10,250
THE FERRETS' DREAM OF MAKING IT
TO THE FINALS

497
00:20:10,291 --> 00:20:12,041
NOW RESTS
IN THE AVATAR'S HANDS.

498
00:20:12,083 --> 00:20:14,375
BUT WITH THREE-ON-ONE,
I DON'T LIKE HER ODDS.

499
00:20:14,417 --> 00:20:16,875
- [groans]

500
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:21,500
- ARE YOU OKAY?
HOW'S YOUR SHOULDER?

501
00:20:21,542 --> 00:20:23,959
- [groans]
IT'S MESSED UP PRETTY BAD.

502
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,750
BUT I THINK I'LL BE ALL RIGHT.

503
00:20:25,792 --> 00:20:27,542
[buzzer rings]

504
00:20:29,875 --> 00:20:32,250
ARE WE GOING
TO BE ALL RIGHT?

505
00:20:32,291 --> 00:20:34,875
- OF COURSE WE ARE.
WE'RE BROTHERS.

506
00:20:34,917 --> 00:20:36,834
WE'LL GET THROUGH
THIS MESS.

507
00:20:36,875 --> 00:20:38,834
I'M SORRY.

508
00:20:38,875 --> 00:20:40,500
- ME, TOO.

509
00:20:40,542 --> 00:20:43,041
GIRLS.
- SERIOUSLY.

510
00:20:43,083 --> 00:20:46,458
- WHAT AN UNBELIEVABLE EFFORT
HERE BY KORRA.

511
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:48,375
SHE'S DODGING EVERY ELEMENT
THE WASPS THROW AT HER.

512
00:20:48,417 --> 00:20:49,834
- AH!

513
00:20:49,875 --> 00:20:51,625
[buzzer rings]

514
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:52,875
- THE AVATAR FINALLY GAINS
SOME GROUND,

515
00:20:52,917 --> 00:20:54,500
BUT WITH ONLY
TEN SECONDS REMAINING,

516
00:20:54,542 --> 00:20:59,000
IT MIGHT BE TOO LITTLE,
TOO LATE.

517
00:20:59,041 --> 00:21:00,333
[buzzer rings]

518
00:21:00,375 --> 00:21:01,458
[yelling]
