I am interested in him,

78
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:04,545
what would I do?

79
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:07,221

80
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:10,520
where the heroine fell in love
with the enemy general's son,

81
00:04:10,584 --> 00:04:12,427
who's supposed to marry the princess.

- You should do what she did
- Tell me!

She rode a dragon into battle
and burned down the entire country,

then she jumped into a volcano.
It was so romantic.

- No, nu, no!

The best way to win a boy's heart

87
00:04:25,899 --> 00:04:28,140
is to brew a love potion
of rainbows and sunsets

88
00:04:28,235 --> 00:04:31,648
that makes true lovers sprout wings
and fly into <i>a</i> magical castle in the sky,

89

where they get married
and eat clouds with spoons,

90
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:35,779
and use stars as ice cubes
in their moonlight punch.

Daddy was in love with someone else
before you?

100

- That's right.
- So what did you do?

101
00:05:01,268 --> 00:05:03,839
Well, for the longest time, I did nothing.

102
00:05:03,937 --> 00:05:06,349
I was so shy and scared of rejection...

103
00:05:06,473 --> 00:05:09,920
But watching my soul mate
spend his life with the wrong woman

104
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:11,455
became too painful.

105
00:05:11,511 --> 00:05:15,323

and I confessed my love to Tenzin.
