YOU SHOULD...

207

YOU SHOULD LEAVE IT
TO THE POLICE.

TALKING TO MAKO

IS GOING TO BE
LIKE PULLING TEETH?

234

WITH HIS FEELINGS" GUY.

236

BUT IT'LL GET BETTER
EVENTUALLY.

237
00:10:07,125 --> 00:10:09,083

238
00:10:09,125 --> 00:10:10,458
DID HE TELL YOU
THAT WE BROKE UP?

239
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:13,291
- YEAH. WE ALL KNEW.

240
00:10:13,333 --> 00:10:14,834
SORRY.

241
00:10:14,875 --> 00:10:16,417
- THAT'S PRETTY EMBARRASSING.

242
00:10:16,458 --> 00:10:18,750
- ACTUALLY, I NEED TO TELL YOU
SOMETHING ABOUT THAT,

243
00:10:18,792 --> 00:10:20,542
AND I SHOULD'VE
TOLD YOU THIS SOONER,

244
00:10:20,583 --> 00:10:23,750
BUT...WHILE YOU WERE GONE,

245
00:10:23,792 --> 00:10:26,875
I...KIND OF...KISSED HIM.

246
00:10:26,917 --> 00:10:28,041
I'M SORRY.

HE WAS GOING OUT WITH YOU, SO.

I THOUGHT YOU KNEW!

253

IN THE FIRST PLACE?

265

JUST GAVE ME AN IDEA

276

HOW TO GET RID
OF THESE VINES.

277

WHEN A NEW GUY
GETS AIRBENDING,

282
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:47,041
DOES THAT MAKE HIM
OUR BROTHER?

283
00:11:47,083 --> 00:11:49,875
- WELL, IN A WAY,
ALL AIRBENDERS ARE OUR FAMILY.

284
00:11:49,917 --> 00:11:51,500
- DOES THAT MEAN
I HAVE TO SHARE MY ROOM?

285
00:11:51,542 --> 00:11:52,959
BECAUSE I LIKE
MY PERSONAL SPACE.

286
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,959
- OF COURSE NOT.

287
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,542

TO GET USED

288
00:11:56,583 --> 00:11:59,083

AROUND ANY MORE.

289

I WANNA BE A COMMANDER

AIRBENDER PRESIDENT?

- NO.

297

THE NEW AIRBENDERS

298
00:12:21,458 --> 00:12:23,083

MAY HAVE BROUGHT BACK
THE AIR NATION.

351
00:16:08,792 --> 00:16:11,625
AND THAT CAN ONLY BE GOOD
FOR RESTORING BALANCE.

352
00:16:11,667 --> 00:16:14,166
THAT IS THE ACT
OF A GREAT AVATAR.

353
00:16:14,208 --> 00:16:16,333
- IT'S SCARY.

354
00:16:16,375 --> 00:16:19,709
I HAVE ALL THIS POWER AND ALL
THESE PEOPLE DEPENDING ON ME,

355
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:22,625
BUT I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I'M SUPPOSED TO BE DOING
HALF THE TIME.

356
00:16:22,667 --> 00:16:26,041
IT SEEMS LIKE I SHOULD BE...
WISER.

357
00:16:26,083 --> 00:16:29,500
- TRUE WISDOM BEGINS WHEN
WE ACCEPT THINGS AS THEY ARE.

358
00:16:29,542 --> 00:16:32,125
YOU STARTED A NEW AGE,
KORRA.

359
00:16:32,166 --> 00:16:34,000
THERE'S NO GOING BACK
TO THE PAST.

360
00:16:34,041 --> 00:16:35,250
- MAKO CALLED!

361
00:16:35,291 --> 00:16:36,959
THE COPS FOUND
THE NEW AIRBENDER GUY.

362
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,917
BUT WHEN THEY TRIED
TO BRING HIM IN,

363
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:42,041
HE RAN AWAY AND CLIMBED
TO THE TOP OF KYOSHI BRIDGE
AND HE WON'T COME DOWN.

364
00:16:42,083 --> 00:16:43,333
OOH! SORRY.

365
00:16:43,375 --> 00:16:45,959
DID I INTERRUPT
AN AVATAR WISDOM SESSION?

366
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,959
- AVATAR WISDOM'S
A THING OF THE PAST, BOLIN.

367
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,458
COME ON!
- OH, OKAY.

368
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:53,000
IS THAT A GOOD THING?
- DEPENDS WHO YOU ASK.

369
00:16:53,041 --> 00:16:55,917
- [growls]

370
00:17:04,291 --> 00:17:05,834
- COME DOWN IMMEDIATELY,

371
00:17:05,875 --> 00:17:07,959
OR WE WILL BE FORCED
TO TAKE ACTION.

372
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,583
- [panting]

373
00:17:10,625 --> 00:17:13,500
STAY BACK!
I'M DANGEROUS!

374
00:17:13,542 --> 00:17:15,458
[whimpering]

375
00:17:18,208 --> 00:17:20,500
[screams]
SORRY!

376
00:17:35,333 --> 00:17:38,208
- DON'T PANIC,
I'M JUST HERE TO TALK.

377
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:41,875
- PLEASE!
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M DOING,
AND I DON'T WANNA HURT ANYONE.

378
00:17:41,917 --> 00:17:43,417
- TELL ME ABOUT IT.

379
00:17:43,458 --> 00:17:44,834
ROUGH DAY, HUH?

380
00:17:44,875 --> 00:17:46,583
I'M HAVING
KIND OF A ROUGH DAY MYSELF.

381
00:17:46,625 --> 00:17:48,208
YOU MIND IF I SIT DOWN HERE?

382
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:52,000
- [whimpering]
- LOOK,
I KNOW YOU'RE SCARED.

383
00:17:52,041 --> 00:17:53,542
YOU'VE GONE THROUGH
A BIG CHANGE,

384
00:17:53,583 --> 00:17:55,417
AND IT'S KIND OF MY FAULT.

385
00:17:55,458 --> 00:17:57,417
BUT YOU'RE NOT ALONE.

386
00:17:57,458 --> 00:18:00,000
THERE ARE OTHER AIRBENDERS
AND THEY WANNA HELP YOU.

387
00:18:00,041 --> 00:18:02,250
ACTUALLY THEY'RE REALLY
EXCITED TO MEET YOU.

388
00:18:02,291 --> 00:18:04,208
- I DON'T WANNA BE
AN AIRBENDER.

389
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:06,834
PLEASE! YOU'RE THE AVATAR.
MAKE IT STOP!

390
00:18:06,875 --> 00:18:08,000
[yells]

391
00:18:08,041 --> 00:18:10,917
- I'M SORRY, I CAN'T.

392
00:18:10,959 --> 00:18:13,083
BUT I PROMISE YOU
THINGS WILL GET BETTER

393
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:15,083
IF YOU JUST GIVE IT A CHANCE.

394
00:18:15,125 --> 00:18:16,917
LET ME TAKE YOU
OVER TO AIR TEMPLE ISLAND

395
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:20,083
AND WE CAN TALK THIS THROUGH,
OKAY?

396
00:18:24,458 --> 00:18:27,458
- [screaming]

397
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,333
[crowd cheering]

398
00:18:36,375 --> 00:18:39,041
- DAW, THIS IS TENZIN.

399
00:18:39,083 --> 00:18:40,542
HE'S GOING TO HELP YOU.

400
00:18:40,583 --> 00:18:43,792
- IT IS ABSOLUTELY MY PLEASURE
TO MEET YOU, DAW.

401
00:18:43,834 --> 00:18:45,667
I'VE NEVER MET
A NEW AIRBENDER BEFORE.

402
00:18:45,709 --> 00:18:47,458
WELL, AT LEAST NO ONE

403
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:49,166
WHOSE DIAPER
I DIDN'T HAVE TO CHANGE.

404
00:18:49,208 --> 00:18:51,333
- ACTUALLY I JUST FELL
OFF A BRIDGE,

405
00:18:51,375 --> 00:18:54,750
SO I COULD USE A FRESH DIAPER
RIGHT ABOUT NOW.

406
00:18:55,208 --> 00:18:56,959
- SO IS THIS THE DEAL?

407
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,250
WE HAVE A CRISIS
EVERY OTHER DAY NOW,
THANKS TO YOU?

408
00:19:00,291 --> 00:19:01,917
- LISTEN, I KNOW
YOU'RE HAVING A TOUGH TIME

409
00:19:01,959 --> 00:19:03,333
GETTING USED
TO THESE CHANGES,

410
00:19:03,375 --> 00:19:05,208
AND I'M SORRY FOR THAT.

411
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:07,125
BUT YOU AND EVERYONE ELSE
ARE GONNA HAVE TO LEARN

412
00:19:07,166 --> 00:19:08,875
TO LIVE WITH IT.

413
00:19:08,917 --> 00:19:11,458
THE VINES AND THE SPIRITS
ARE HERE TO STAY.

414
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:13,875
- WELL, YOU KNOW
WHO'S NOT HERE TO SAY? YOU!

415
00:19:13,917 --> 00:19:15,667
I ORDER YOU
TO LEAVE THIS CITY.

416
00:19:15,709 --> 00:19:17,291
YOU'VE CAUSED NOTHING
BUT TROUBLE SINCE YOU ARRIVED.

417
00:19:17,333 --> 00:19:19,166
[crowd gasps]

418
00:19:21,333 --> 00:19:24,959
- DON'T WORRY.
I WAS ALREADY LEAVING.

419
00:19:30,041 --> 00:19:32,583
I CAN SEE MY PATH NOW.

420
00:19:32,625 --> 00:19:34,083
THERE ARE NEW AIRBENDERS
OUT THERE,

421
00:19:34,125 --> 00:19:36,375
AND I'M GONNA FIND THEM
AND REBUILD THE AIR NATION.

422
00:19:36,417 --> 00:19:38,375
- DON'T THINK
I'M NOT GOING WITH YOU.

423
00:19:38,417 --> 00:19:40,250
IT'S SO EXCITING.

424
00:19:40,291 --> 00:19:41,917
WHO KNOWS
WHO'S OUT THERE RIGHT NOW,

425
00:19:41,959 --> 00:19:45,000
DISCOVERING THE GIFT OF
AIRBENDING FOR THE FIRST TIME?

426
00:20:01,166 --> 00:20:04,083
[rumbling]

427
00:20:12,458 --> 00:20:16,583
- YOU KNOW THE DRILL, ZAHEER.
- OF COURSE.

428
00:20:18,917 --> 00:20:21,542
- HOPE YOU STILL LIKE RICE.

429
00:20:21,583 --> 00:20:23,166
- HAVE YOU EVER READ
THE POETRY

430
00:20:23,208 --> 00:20:25,333
OF THE GREAT AIRBENDING GURU
LAGHIMA?

431
00:20:25,375 --> 00:20:26,834
- WHAT?

432
00:20:26,875 --> 00:20:29,834
- GURU LAGHIMA
LIVED 4,000 YEARS AGO

433
00:20:29,875 --> 00:20:31,500
IN THE NORTHERN AIR TEMPLE.

434
00:20:31,542 --> 00:20:34,792
IT IS SAID THAT HE UNLOCKED
THE SECRET OF WEIGHTLESSNESS

435
00:20:34,834 --> 00:20:36,792
AND BECAME UNTETHERED
FROM THE EARTH,

436
00:20:36,834 --> 00:20:38,875
LIVING HIS FINAL 40 YEARS

437
00:20:38,917 --> 00:20:40,875
WITHOUT EVER TOUCHING
THE GROUND.

438
00:20:40,917 --> 00:20:42,500
- IS THAT HOW YOU PLAN
TO ESCAPE,

439
00:20:42,542 --> 00:20:44,041
WITH SOMETHING YOU PICKED UP

440
00:20:44,083 --> 00:20:45,875
FROM AN OLD AIRBENDER
CHILDREN'S STORY?

441
00:20:45,917 --> 00:20:48,083
- LIKE ALL GREAT
CHILDREN'S TALES,

442
00:20:48,125 --> 00:20:50,375
IT CONTAINS TRUTH
WITHIN THE MYTH.

443
00:20:50,417 --> 00:20:52,333
LAGHIMA ONCE WROTE,

444
00:20:52,375 --> 00:20:55,709
"INSTINCT IS A LIE
TOLD BY A FEARFUL BODY,

445
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:57,375
HOPING TO BE WRONG."

446
00:20:57,417 --> 00:20:59,041
- WHAT'S THAT
SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

447
00:20:59,083 --> 00:21:01,834
- IT MEANS THAT WHEN YOU BASE
YOUR EXPECTATIONS

448
00:21:01,875 --> 00:21:03,875
ONLY ON WHAT YOU SEE,

449
00:21:03,917 --> 00:21:06,208
YOU BLIND YOURSELF
TO THE POSSIBILITIES

450
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:08,208
OF A NEW REALITY.

451
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:09,709
- UGH!

452
00:21:13,417 --> 00:21:15,250
- AH, AH, AH.

453
00:21:15,291 --> 00:21:17,917
YOU WOULDN'T WANNA
SINGE YOUR FRIEND, WOULD YOU?

454
00:21:17,959 --> 00:21:19,417
- HOW?

455
00:21:19,458 --> 00:21:21,875
YOU'RE NOT A BENDER!

456
00:21:21,917 --> 00:21:25,959
- NATURE IS CONSTANTLY CHANGING,
LIKE THE WIND.

457
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:29,709
- [grunts]

458
00:21:54,166 --> 00:21:57,125
- NOW YOU MIGHT WANNA RATION
THAT BOWL OF RICE.

459
00:21:57,166 --> 00:22:00,542
YOU'VE GOT THREE WEEKS
UNTIL THE NEXT SHIFT CHANGE.

460
00:22:00,583 --> 00:22:04,959
IT'S THE DAWNING OF A NEW AGE,
THE END OF THE WHITE LOTUS,

461
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:09,125
AND SOON,
THE END OF THE AVATAR.
