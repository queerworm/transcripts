1
00:00:01,419 --> 00:00:02,504
- Tenzin: EARTH.

2
00:00:02,587 --> 00:00:04,380
FIRE.

3
00:00:04,464 --> 00:00:06,090
AIR.

4
00:00:06,174 --> 00:00:07,967
WATER.

5
00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:12,514
ONLY THE AVATAR CAN MASTER
ALL FOUR ELEMENTS

6
00:00:12,597 --> 00:00:15,600
AND BRING BALANCE
TO THE WORLD.

7
00:00:20,647 --> 00:00:23,024
THE RED LOTUS HAS CAPTURED
THE AVATAR.

8
00:00:23,107 --> 00:00:25,360
KORRA GAVE HERSELF UP IN
EXCHANGE FOR THE AIRBENDERS,

9
00:00:25,443 --> 00:00:26,778
BUT ZAHEER DOUBLE-CROSSED HER,

10
00:00:26,861 --> 00:00:29,531
WHILE GHAZAN TRAPPED
TEAM AVATAR IN THE TEMPLE.

11
00:00:29,614 --> 00:00:30,949
ALL SEEMED LOST

12
00:00:31,032 --> 00:00:33,117
UNTIL BOLIN SAVED THEIR LIVES
BY LAVABENDING.

13
00:00:33,201 --> 00:00:34,994
BUT HE'S NOT THE ONLY ONE
WITH NEW SKILLS...

14
00:00:35,078 --> 00:00:37,622
ZAHEER UNLOCKED THE ANCIENT
AIRBENDING ABILITY OF FLIGHT.

15
00:00:37,705 --> 00:00:41,042
WILL TEAM AVATAR SAVE THE AIR NATION
AND KORRA BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE?

16
00:00:50,593 --> 00:00:53,137
WHEN I GET OUT OF HERE,
NONE OF YOU WILL SURVIVE!

17
00:00:53,221 --> 00:00:54,764
- YOU WON'T GET OUT.

18
00:00:54,847 --> 00:00:57,642
UNLESS THE METAL CLAN TAUGHT
YOU A WAY TO BEND PLATINUM.

19
00:00:57,725 --> 00:00:59,894
ONCE WE ADMINISTER
THIS POISON,

20
00:00:59,978 --> 00:01:01,729
YOUR BODY WILL
NATURALLY REACT,

21
00:01:01,813 --> 00:01:03,731
FORCING YOU
INTO THE AVATAR STATE

22
00:01:03,815 --> 00:01:05,400
IN AN EFFORT
TO KEEP YOU ALIVE.

23
00:01:05,483 --> 00:01:06,859
SADLY FOR YOU,

24
00:01:06,943 --> 00:01:09,195
YOU'LL BE ENTERING IT
FOR THE LAST TIME.

25
00:01:09,279 --> 00:01:10,280
- NO.

26
00:01:10,363 --> 00:01:12,115
THE AVATAR CYCLE...

27
00:01:12,198 --> 00:01:13,199
- YES.

28
00:01:13,283 --> 00:01:15,618
WHEN WE DISPATCH YOU
IN THE AVATAR STATE,

29
00:01:15,702 --> 00:01:17,412
THE CYCLE WILL END.

30
00:01:17,495 --> 00:01:18,913
SO WE LUCKY FEW,

31
00:01:18,997 --> 00:01:21,583
THIS BAND OF BROTHERS
AND SISTERS IN ANARCHY,

32
00:01:21,666 --> 00:01:24,586
ARE WITNESSING THE BEGINNING
OF AN ERA OF TRUE FREEDOM.

33
00:01:24,669 --> 00:01:28,548
TOGETHER WE WILL FORGE A WORLD
WITHOUT KINGS AND QUEENS,

34
00:01:28,631 --> 00:01:29,966
WITHOUT BORDERS OR NATIONS,

35
00:01:30,049 --> 00:01:32,844
WHERE A MAN'S ONLY ALLEGIANCE
IS TO HIMSELF

36
00:01:32,927 --> 00:01:34,596
AND THOSE HE LOVES.

37
00:01:34,679 --> 00:01:39,559
WE WILL RETURN TO THE TRUE
BALANCE OF NATURAL ORDER.

38
00:01:39,642 --> 00:01:42,228
AND THOUGH YOU
WILL NEVER AGAIN BE REBORN,

39
00:01:42,312 --> 00:01:44,397
YOUR NAME WILL ECHO
THROUGHOUT HISTORY.

40
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:47,275
KORRA, THE LAST AVATAR.

41
00:01:58,286 --> 00:02:00,079
DID YOU FIND ANY WAY
TO ESCAPE?

42
00:02:00,163 --> 00:02:02,332
- NO, NOT YET.

43
00:02:02,415 --> 00:02:04,709
BUT DON'T WORRY.
WE'LL FIND A WAY OUT SOON.

44
00:02:04,792 --> 00:02:06,586
THEY MIGHT NOT
MAKE IT THAT LONG.

45
00:02:09,589 --> 00:02:12,133
KORRA WILL COME TO SAVE US,
RIGHT?

46
00:02:12,216 --> 00:02:14,552
I THINK WE'RE GOING TO HAVE
TO DO THIS ON OUR OWN.

47
00:02:21,392 --> 00:02:23,061
- ADMINISTER THE POISON.

48
00:02:36,491 --> 00:02:38,326
AH.
AHH!

49
00:02:50,963 --> 00:02:52,298
- GET READY.

50
00:02:52,382 --> 00:02:54,759
AS SOON AS SHE'S IN THE AVATAR
STATE, TAKE HER OUT.

51
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:13,611
- WAIT.

52
00:03:13,695 --> 00:03:16,197
WHY ISN'T SHE STAYING
IN THE AVATAR STATE?

53
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,532
- GIVE IT TIME.

54
00:03:17,615 --> 00:03:19,409
SHE CAN'T RESIST FOR LONG.

55
00:03:23,913 --> 00:03:25,581
THE PLACE WHERE I SAW THEM
TAKING THE AIRBENDERS

56
00:03:25,665 --> 00:03:26,916
IS AROUND HERE.

57
00:03:26,999 --> 00:03:28,918
THAT'S GOTTA BE WHERE
THEY TOOK KORRA.

58
00:03:30,253 --> 00:03:31,337
- Kai: THAT'S IT!

59
00:03:31,421 --> 00:03:32,547
DOWN THERE, LEFTY.

60
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:43,766
FIND THE AIRBENDERS

61
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:45,393
AND MY FAMILY.

62
00:03:45,977 --> 00:03:47,228
- DON'T WORRY.

63
00:03:47,311 --> 00:03:49,105
I'M NOT COMING OUT
WITHOUT OUR CHILDREN

64
00:03:49,188 --> 00:03:50,481
AND THE REST OF YOUR PEOPLE.

65
00:04:02,744 --> 00:04:03,995
- IT'S WORKING.

66
00:04:10,501 --> 00:04:12,295
- Amon: I TOLD YOU, KORRA.

67
00:04:15,173 --> 00:04:18,050
THE WORLD DOESN'T NEED YOU
ANYMORE.

68
00:04:22,638 --> 00:04:25,183
THE TIME OF THE AVATAR
IS OVER, KORRA.

69
00:04:25,266 --> 00:04:26,726
GIVE UP.

70
00:04:31,189 --> 00:04:36,611
YOU'RE TOO WEAK TO RESIST
AND I'M STRONGER THAN EVER.

71
00:04:36,778 --> 00:04:38,654
THERE'S NO USE FIGHTING.

72
00:04:39,363 --> 00:04:40,990
LET GO.

73
00:04:41,407 --> 00:04:43,284
All: LET GO.

74
00:04:43,367 --> 00:04:47,246
LET GO.

75
00:04:52,543 --> 00:04:53,753
- I'M THIRSTY.

76
00:04:53,836 --> 00:04:55,087
- I GOTTA GO PEE.

77
00:04:55,171 --> 00:04:56,172
- ME TOO.

78
00:04:56,255 --> 00:04:58,382
HEY.
KEEP IT DOWN OVER THERE

79
00:04:58,466 --> 00:05:00,301
OR YOU'RE ALL GOING
TO END UP LIKE THEM.

80
00:05:00,968 --> 00:05:03,346
SIR, PLEASE.
COULD WE JUST HAVE SOME WATER?

81
00:05:03,429 --> 00:05:05,932
THERE ARE CHILDREN
AND A BABY HERE.

82
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:14,482
- AH!

83
00:05:20,196 --> 00:05:23,074
OH, SO YOU JUST CALLED
ME OVER TO ATTACK ME.

84
00:05:23,157 --> 00:05:26,202
FINE.
NOW NOBODY GETS ANY WATER.

85
00:05:26,285 --> 00:05:27,745
AH.

86
00:05:27,829 --> 00:05:30,081
I DON'T KNOW HOW WE ENDED
UP HERE IN DAY CARE

87
00:05:30,164 --> 00:05:33,668
WHILE EVERYONE ELSE GETS TO
WATCH THE AVATAR BEING DESTROYED.

88
00:05:33,751 --> 00:05:35,503
I CAN HOLD A BOWL OF POISON.

89
00:05:37,755 --> 00:05:38,798
- HEY!

90
00:05:38,881 --> 00:05:40,007
WHAT DO YOU
THINK YOU'RE DOING?

91
00:05:51,018 --> 00:05:52,186
- AH!

92
00:05:56,315 --> 00:05:57,316
- MOM!

93
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,861
OH, HONEY,
I'M SO GLAD YOU'RE SAFE.

94
00:05:59,944 --> 00:06:01,612
OH!
- ME TOO.

95
00:06:10,746 --> 00:06:12,707
YOU'RE ALIVE.
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

96
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:13,749
- WHY?

97
00:06:13,833 --> 00:06:15,167
JUST BECAUSE I WAS BLOWN
OUT OF THE SKY

98
00:06:15,251 --> 00:06:17,753
AND FELL HUNDREDS OF FEET
DOWN A CLIFF?

99
00:06:17,837 --> 00:06:20,256
DON'T YOU KNOW IT TAKES MORE
THAN THAT TO GET RID OF ME?

100
00:06:23,301 --> 00:06:25,094
WE HAVE TO GET THESE TWO
OUT OF HERE NOW.

101
00:06:25,177 --> 00:06:26,554
THEY DON'T LOOK SO GOOD.

102
00:06:26,637 --> 00:06:29,515
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

103
00:06:29,599 --> 00:06:32,602
I FEEL GREAT.

104
00:06:32,685 --> 00:06:34,395
YOU GUYS GET EVERYONE
OUT OF HERE.

105
00:06:34,478 --> 00:06:35,521
I'LL SEARCH FOR KORRA.

106
00:06:35,605 --> 00:06:36,647
- WE'RE GOING WITH YOU.

107
00:06:36,731 --> 00:06:38,608
YOU DON'T HAVE TO SEARCH
FOR HER.

108
00:06:38,691 --> 00:06:41,319
I KNOW EXACTLY WHERE
SHE'S BEING HELD.

109
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:54,081
- NOW!

110
00:06:54,165 --> 00:06:55,333
DESTROY THE AVATAR.

111
00:07:05,092 --> 00:07:06,344
UGH.

112
00:07:39,627 --> 00:07:41,128
AH!

113
00:07:42,964 --> 00:07:43,965
- KORRA.

114
00:07:52,056 --> 00:07:54,016
WE HAVE TO HELP HER!

115
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:55,101
- LOOK OUT!

116
00:07:57,019 --> 00:07:58,729
YOU HELP KORRA.
WE GOT THIS.

117
00:08:37,101 --> 00:08:40,187
DADDY!

118
00:08:40,271 --> 00:08:42,231
OH, THANK GOODNESS
YOU'RE ALL RIGHT.

119
00:08:44,442 --> 00:08:45,735
- HONEY, ARE YOU OKAY?

120
00:08:45,818 --> 00:08:46,944
- I'LL BE FINE.

121
00:08:53,492 --> 00:08:54,952
- WE HAVE TO HELP KORRA.

122
00:09:14,638 --> 00:09:16,057
AH!

123
00:09:21,353 --> 00:09:22,938
WHAT ARE YOU SMILING ABOUT?

124
00:09:23,022 --> 00:09:25,649
I WAS JUST REMEMBERING
THE LAST TIME WE FOUGHT.

125
00:09:27,985 --> 00:09:30,404
WELL, A LOT HAS CHANGED
SINCE THEN.

126
00:09:34,158 --> 00:09:36,202
SO THAT'S HOW
YOU GOT OUT OF THE TEMPLE.

127
00:09:36,285 --> 00:09:37,286
NOT BAD.

128
00:09:37,369 --> 00:09:38,662
LET'S SEE
WHAT YOU'VE GOT.

129
00:11:19,597 --> 00:11:21,932
YOU CAN'T FIGHT ME
AND THE POISON.

130
00:11:25,102 --> 00:11:27,146
I CAN FLY UP ON MY BISON
TO HELP HER.

131
00:11:27,229 --> 00:11:28,898
YOU'D NEVER BE ABLE
TO KEEP UP WITH ZAHEER.

132
00:11:28,981 --> 00:11:29,982
HE'S TOO POWERFUL.

133
00:11:30,065 --> 00:11:31,775
- WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING.

134
00:11:31,859 --> 00:11:33,444
- HOW CAN HE FLY LIKE THAT?

135
00:11:33,527 --> 00:11:35,696
HE'S UNLOCKED POWERS
OF AIRBENDING

136
00:11:35,779 --> 00:11:38,782
THAT HAVEN'T EXISTED
FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS.

137
00:11:38,866 --> 00:11:41,035
THERE HAVEN'T BEEN
THIS MANY AIRBENDERS

138
00:11:41,118 --> 00:11:43,787
IN ONE PLACE
FOR A LONG TIME, EITHER.

139
00:11:43,871 --> 00:11:45,539
WE HAVE POWER TOGETHER.

140
00:11:46,624 --> 00:11:48,375
HURRY!
EVERYONE FORM A CIRCLE.

141
00:11:48,459 --> 00:11:49,710
FOLLOW ME.

142
00:12:13,984 --> 00:12:15,027
AH!

143
00:12:18,405 --> 00:12:20,199
- YOU HAVE NO WATER.

144
00:12:20,282 --> 00:12:21,283
IT'S OVER.

145
00:12:21,367 --> 00:12:22,826
- NOT YET.

146
00:12:33,837 --> 00:12:35,339
NOW IT'S OVER!

147
00:13:01,865 --> 00:13:02,866
- AH!

148
00:13:22,803 --> 00:13:25,347
GIVE UP GHAZAN, YOU CAN'T WIN!

149
00:13:25,431 --> 00:13:27,599
I'M NEVER GOING BACK
TO PRISON.

150
00:13:27,683 --> 00:13:29,685
IF I'M GOING DOWN TODAY,

151
00:13:29,768 --> 00:13:31,145
YOU'RE COMING WITH ME.

152
00:13:39,695 --> 00:13:40,738
- MAKO, HANG ON.

153
00:13:54,209 --> 00:13:55,836
AH!

154
00:13:59,882 --> 00:14:00,883
AH!

155
00:14:21,945 --> 00:14:23,655
THE POISON
HAS DONE ITS WORK.

156
00:14:23,739 --> 00:14:26,784
THE AVATAR CYCLE
WILL BE OVER MOMENTARILY.

157
00:15:19,628 --> 00:15:21,213
AH!

158
00:15:56,165 --> 00:15:57,416
- AH.

159
00:16:11,472 --> 00:16:13,682
- KORRA, SWEETHEART,

160
00:16:13,765 --> 00:16:15,767
IT'S ME, DAD.

161
00:16:16,727 --> 00:16:18,187
PLEASE HANG ON.

162
00:16:31,658 --> 00:16:33,202
- WHAT ARE YOU LAUGHING ABOUT?

163
00:16:33,285 --> 00:16:34,661
- YOU'RE TOO LATE!

164
00:16:34,745 --> 00:16:37,664
THE POISON'S BEEN
IN HER SYSTEM TOO LONG.

165
00:16:37,748 --> 00:16:40,542
THE RED LOTUS HAS WON.

166
00:16:40,626 --> 00:16:43,253
YOU CAN SAVE HER.
THE POISON IS METALLIC.

167
00:17:26,463 --> 00:17:29,216
DAD?
YOU'RE ALIVE.

168
00:17:29,299 --> 00:17:30,968
- I'M HERE FOR YOU.

169
00:17:31,051 --> 00:17:32,844
I'M NEVER GOING TO LET YOU GO.

170
00:17:33,303 --> 00:17:34,388
- Zaheer: NO!

171
00:17:34,471 --> 00:17:35,722
NO!

172
00:17:35,806 --> 00:17:37,182
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

173
00:17:37,266 --> 00:17:39,685
THE REVOLUTION
HAS ALREADY BEGUN.

174
00:17:39,768 --> 00:17:42,604
CHAOS IS THE
NATURAL ORDER OF...

175
00:17:43,855 --> 00:17:46,275
YOU SEE WHAT I DID THERE?
I PUT A SOCK IN IT.

176
00:17:46,358 --> 00:17:47,401
LITERALLY.

177
00:17:47,484 --> 00:17:49,111
- CLASSIC BOLIN.

178
00:17:49,194 --> 00:17:50,696
- I DO WHAT I DO.

179
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:04,751
- THERE YOU GO.

180
00:18:04,835 --> 00:18:07,462
ALL FIXED UP FOR A FORMAL
AVATAR APPEARANCE.

181
00:18:07,546 --> 00:18:08,589
TAKE A LOOK.

182
00:18:10,674 --> 00:18:12,593
- IT'S GREAT.

183
00:18:12,676 --> 00:18:13,677
THANKS.

184
00:18:14,511 --> 00:18:18,515
YOU KNOW, NOBODY EXPECTS YOU
TO BOUNCE BACK RIGHT AWAY.

185
00:18:18,599 --> 00:18:20,225
IT'S ONLY BEEN TWO WEEKS.

186
00:18:20,309 --> 00:18:21,852
YOU NEED TIME TO HEAL.

187
00:18:25,856 --> 00:18:27,774
I WANT YOU TO KNOW
THAT I'M HERE FOR YOU.

188
00:18:27,858 --> 00:18:31,320
IF YOU EVER WANT TO TALK,
OR ANYTHING.

189
00:18:31,403 --> 00:18:33,822
BUT LET'S JUST TRY
TO ENJOY THIS TODAY.

190
00:18:34,489 --> 00:18:36,783
FOR JINORA.

191
00:18:36,867 --> 00:18:38,952
- YOU'RE RIGHT.

192
00:18:39,036 --> 00:18:40,078
OKAY.

193
00:18:40,162 --> 00:18:41,204
LET'S GO.

194
00:19:00,057 --> 00:19:01,725
- YOU LOOK BEAUTIFUL, SWEETIE.

195
00:19:03,727 --> 00:19:05,771
YOU'RE LOOKING STRONGER
EVERY DAY, KORRA.

196
00:19:05,854 --> 00:19:08,940
I'D LIKE TO OFFICIALLY
WELCOME YOU BACK TO REPUBLIC CITY.

197
00:19:09,024 --> 00:19:10,734
I KNOW THAT THE LAST TIME
WE SAW EACH OTHER

198
00:19:10,817 --> 00:19:12,986
IT DIDN'T END
ON THE BEST TERMS,

199
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:14,321
BUT I WANT TO THANK YOU
FOR TAKING DOWN

200
00:19:14,404 --> 00:19:16,323
THOSE RED LOTUS TERRORISTS.

201
00:19:18,742 --> 00:19:20,494
- WE SHOULD GO INSIDE.

202
00:19:20,577 --> 00:19:23,163
- I CAN HELP.
- I WANNA RIDE WITH KORRA.

203
00:19:23,246 --> 00:19:24,539
JINORA'S ALREADY INSIDE.

204
00:19:24,623 --> 00:19:26,500
IT SMELLS LIKE SHOE TREES.

205
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:29,211
- SANDALWOOD, MEELO.

206
00:19:29,294 --> 00:19:30,587
- I GOT THIS.

207
00:19:32,923 --> 00:19:34,633
HANG IN THERE, KID.

208
00:19:40,722 --> 00:19:42,599
- SHE'S NOT LOOKING GOOD.

209
00:19:42,683 --> 00:19:45,185
NEITHER WOULD YOU IF YOU'D
GONE THROUGH WHAT SHE HAD.

210
00:19:45,268 --> 00:19:46,395
- SHE'LL BE FINE.

211
00:19:46,478 --> 00:19:48,146
SHE JUST NEEDS TIME TO HEAL.

212
00:19:48,814 --> 00:19:50,565
THE POISON TOOK A GREAT TOLL.

213
00:19:50,649 --> 00:19:51,858
- OF COURSE.

214
00:19:51,942 --> 00:19:53,527
I'M JUST SAYING,
WITH THE EARTH KINGDOM

215
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:56,863
IN COMPLETE DISARRAY
SINCE THE LOSS OF THE QUEEN...

216
00:19:56,947 --> 00:19:58,782
AND EVEN WITH ZAHEER
LOCKED UP AGAIN,

217
00:19:58,865 --> 00:20:01,076
WE STILL DON'T KNOW
HOW MANY RED LOTUS MEMBERS

218
00:20:01,159 --> 00:20:03,245
MIGHT BE OUT THERE, HIDING.

219
00:20:03,328 --> 00:20:04,871
- EXACTLY.

220
00:20:04,955 --> 00:20:06,540
WITH THE WORLD GETTING MORE
AND MORE DANGEROUS,

221
00:20:06,623 --> 00:20:09,543
WE NEED THE AVATAR
NOW MORE THAN EVER.

222
00:20:09,626 --> 00:20:12,212
WHO WILL PROTECT US
WHILE SHE'S IN A WHEELCHAIR?

223
00:20:18,009 --> 00:20:19,469
- JINORA, COME FORWARD.

224
00:20:23,974 --> 00:20:27,811
TODAY WE WELCOME THE FIRST
AIRBENDING MASTER IN A GENERATION,

225
00:20:27,894 --> 00:20:31,648
AND I COULDN'T BE MORE PROUD
OF MY DAUGHTER.

226
00:20:31,732 --> 00:20:34,401
WHEN THE EXISTENCE OF
OUR PEOPLE WAS THREATENED,

227
00:20:34,484 --> 00:20:37,404
WHEN THE AVATAR'S LIFE
HUNG IN THE BALANCE,

228
00:20:37,487 --> 00:20:39,322
JINORA NEVER GAVE UP HOPE.

229
00:20:39,406 --> 00:20:44,035
THANKS TO HER LEADERSHIP, I SEE A VERY
BRIGHT FUTURE FOR THE AIR NATION.

230
00:20:44,119 --> 00:20:47,956
OF COURSE, THERE WOULD BE NO AIR
NATION WITHOUT AVATAR KORRA.

231
00:20:48,039 --> 00:20:52,586
SHE OPENED THE PORTALS AND SOMEHOW
THE WORLD BEGAN ANEW FOR US.

232
00:20:52,669 --> 00:20:55,088
AND SHE WAS EVEN WILLING
TO LAY DOWN HER OWN LIFE

233
00:20:55,172 --> 00:20:57,257
IN ORDER TO PROTECT OURS.

234
00:20:57,340 --> 00:21:01,762
THERE'S NO WAY WE CAN EVER
REPAY HER FOR ALL SHE'S DONE.

235
00:21:01,845 --> 00:21:05,724
BUT WE CAN FOLLOW HER EXAMPLE
OF SERVICE AND SACRIFICE.

236
00:21:05,807 --> 00:21:07,642
SO WHILE SHE RECUPERATES,

237
00:21:07,726 --> 00:21:12,481
THE AIR NATION WILL RECLAIM ITS
NOMADIC ROOTS AND ROAM THE EARTH.

238
00:21:12,564 --> 00:21:14,107
BUT UNLIKE OUR ANCESTORS,

239
00:21:14,191 --> 00:21:16,860
WE WILL SERVE PEOPLE
OF ALL NATIONS,

240
00:21:16,943 --> 00:21:20,071
WORKING WHEREVER THERE IS
CORRUPTION AND DISCORD,

241
00:21:20,155 --> 00:21:22,866
TO RESTORE BALANCE AND PEACE.

242
00:21:24,367 --> 00:21:26,119
AVATAR KORRA,

243
00:21:26,203 --> 00:21:28,663
I VOW THAT WE WILL DO
EVERYTHING IN OUR POWER

244
00:21:28,747 --> 00:21:30,081
TO FOLLOW IN YOUR FOOTSTEPS

245
00:21:30,165 --> 00:21:32,542
AND BRING HARMONY
TO THE WORLD.

246
00:21:36,046 --> 00:21:38,381
NOW, LET US ANOINT THE MASTER

247
00:21:38,465 --> 00:21:41,218
WHO WILL HELP LEAD US
IN OUR NEW PATH.
