1
00:00:01,544 --> 00:00:02,754
- Tenzin: EARTH.

2
00:00:03,379 --> 00:00:04,589
FIRE.

3
00:00:05,089 --> 00:00:06,257
AIR.

4
00:00:06,674 --> 00:00:08,009
WATER.

5
00:00:08,927 --> 00:00:13,014
ONLY THE AVATAR CAN MASTER
ALL FOUR ELEMENTS

6
00:00:13,097 --> 00:00:15,183
AND BRING BALANCE
TO THE WORLD.

7
00:00:20,813 --> 00:00:22,857
Man: LIN BEIFONG
HAS A SISTER.

8
00:00:22,941 --> 00:00:24,817
AFTER ARRIVING IN ZAOFU,
KORRA MET OPAL,

9
00:00:24,901 --> 00:00:26,319
A NEW AIRBENDER,
WHOSE MOTHER

10
00:00:26,402 --> 00:00:28,112
IS LIN'S ESTRANGED
HALF-SISTER.

11
00:00:28,238 --> 00:00:30,615
SUYIN AND HER DAUGHTER
WELCOMED LIN WITH OPEN ARMS,

12
00:00:30,698 --> 00:00:32,534
BUT SHE WANTED NOTHING TO DO
WITH THEM.

13
00:00:32,617 --> 00:00:35,161
MEANWHILE, ZAHEER
INFILTRATED AIR TEMPLE ISLAND

14
00:00:35,245 --> 00:00:36,538
LOOKING FOR THE AVATAR.

15
00:00:36,621 --> 00:00:38,331
AFTER BATTLING WITH KYA,
HE ESCAPED

16
00:00:38,414 --> 00:00:40,667
AND IS NOW A WANTED MAN
IN REPUBLIC CITY.

17
00:00:52,971 --> 00:00:54,681
HEY, HAS ANYONE SEEN
CHIEF BEIFONG?

18
00:00:54,764 --> 00:00:56,891
SHE'S PROBABLY OFF SULKING
IN HER ROOM.

19
00:00:56,975 --> 00:00:58,393
I KNOW SHE HAS A PROBLEM
WITH ME,

20
00:00:58,476 --> 00:01:00,395
BUT SHE HAD NO RIGHT TO YELL
AT OPAL LAST NIGHT.

21
00:01:02,146 --> 00:01:04,482
ALL SET FOR
YOUR POWER DISK GAME TODAY, GUYS?

22
00:01:04,607 --> 00:01:07,151
YEAH, ALL SET
TO KICK WEI'S BUTT.

23
00:01:07,318 --> 00:01:08,861
I'M GOING TO POWER DISK
YOUR FACE.

24
00:01:08,945 --> 00:01:11,531
YOU SHOULD COME PLAY WITH US.

25
00:01:11,614 --> 00:01:13,741
OH, I DON'T THINK
I'D BE MUCH COMPETITION

26
00:01:13,825 --> 00:01:15,577
SINCE I CAN'T METALBEND.

27
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:16,744
- REALLY?

28
00:01:16,828 --> 00:01:18,830
LIN NEVER OFFERED
TO TRAIN YOU?

29
00:01:18,997 --> 00:01:21,749
NOPE, AND I GUESS
I NEVER THOUGHT TO BRING IT UP

30
00:01:21,833 --> 00:01:23,126
BECAUSE I WAS LEARNING
TO AIRBEND,

31
00:01:23,209 --> 00:01:24,794
THEN THERE WAS
THE PRO-BENDING,

32
00:01:24,877 --> 00:01:26,421
THEN I GOT TIED UP
FIGHTING THE EQUALISTS.

33
00:01:26,504 --> 00:01:28,047
IT WAS A BUSY FEW MONTHS.

34
00:01:28,756 --> 00:01:30,425
WELL, IT'S PROBABLY
FOR THE BEST.

35
00:01:30,508 --> 00:01:31,926
I'M SURE LIN WOULD BE
A HORRIBLE TEACHER.

36
00:01:34,178 --> 00:01:37,599
AS THE AVATAR, YOU SHOULD HAVE
MASTERY OVER ALL THE ELEMENTS.

37
00:01:37,724 --> 00:01:39,851
I'D BE HAPPY
TO SHOW YOU THE BASICS.

38
00:01:40,018 --> 00:01:42,020
REALLY?
THAT WOULD BE GREAT.

39
00:01:42,895 --> 00:01:44,439
YOU SHOULD TRY IT, TOO.

40
00:01:44,856 --> 00:01:47,275
UH, NAH,
I'M MORE OF AN EARTH GUY.

41
00:01:47,483 --> 00:01:50,153
THE DIRT, ROCKS, YOU KNOW,
MAYBE SOME LIGHT GRAVEL...

42
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:51,571
THAT'S KIND OF
WHERE MY HEART IS.

43
00:01:51,654 --> 00:01:53,323
- OKAY, EARTH GUY.

44
00:01:53,406 --> 00:01:55,867
WELL, LET ME KNOW
IF YOU CHANGE YOUR MIND.

45
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:03,583
- AAH!

46
00:02:09,589 --> 00:02:12,508
IT WORKED!
ZHU-LI, MARK IT DOWN.

47
00:02:12,592 --> 00:02:14,719
MAGNET SUIT TEST SUCCESSFUL.

48
00:02:14,969 --> 00:02:16,554
POWER DOWN.

49
00:02:20,141 --> 00:02:23,478
ON TO PHASE TWO...
ZHU-LI CLEANS UP THIS MESS.

50
00:02:34,864 --> 00:02:36,616
HOW MANY PUSH-UPS
DID YOU DO LAST NIGHT?

51
00:02:36,824 --> 00:02:38,159
'CAUSE I DID, LIKE, 50.

52
00:02:38,284 --> 00:02:39,494
WHAT DO YOU TWO
THINK YOU'RE DOING?

53
00:02:39,577 --> 00:02:40,620
GET BACK TO WORK.

54
00:02:42,455 --> 00:02:44,374
IS EVERYTHING
ALL RIGHT HERE?

55
00:02:45,083 --> 00:02:47,251
THE AVATAR IS IN DANGER,
AND THESE TWO KNUCKLEHEADS

56
00:02:47,335 --> 00:02:49,087
ARE JUST STANDING AROUND
CHITCHATTING.

57
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:50,254
- DON'T WORRY.

58
00:02:50,338 --> 00:02:53,257
ZAOFU IS THE
MOST SECURE CITY IN THE WORLD.

59
00:02:53,883 --> 00:02:55,218
- I'LL BE THE JUDGE OF THAT.

60
00:02:55,301 --> 00:02:57,512
I'M GOING TO CHECK EVERY INCH
OF THIS PLACE.

61
00:02:58,304 --> 00:03:01,307
LIN, YOU DO NOT HAVE TO WORK
WHILE YOU ARE HERE.

62
00:03:01,474 --> 00:03:02,892
YOU NEED TO RELAX.

63
00:03:02,975 --> 00:03:04,560
I'M FINE!

64
00:03:04,936 --> 00:03:06,646
DOESN'T TAKE A TRUTHSEER
TO KNOW

65
00:03:06,729 --> 00:03:09,273
THAT YOU ARE UNDER
A DANGEROUS AMOUNT OF STRESS.

66
00:03:09,691 --> 00:03:12,235
IF YOU DON'T DEAL
WITH YOUR REPRESSED FEELINGS,

67
00:03:12,318 --> 00:03:15,113
THERE WILL BE SEVERE
CONSEQUENCES TO YOUR HEALTH

68
00:03:15,988 --> 00:03:17,448
AND YOUR JOB.

69
00:03:17,573 --> 00:03:18,616
- I'M NOT INTERESTED

70
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:20,368
IN TALKING ABOUT
MY FEELINGS.

71
00:03:20,451 --> 00:03:22,036
YOU WON'T HAVE
TO SAY A WORD.

72
00:03:22,912 --> 00:03:24,956
I KNOW A GREAT ACUPUNCTURIST
IN TOWN

73
00:03:25,331 --> 00:03:26,958
WHO WILL BE ABLE
TO HELP YOU.

74
00:03:30,837 --> 00:03:32,004
- HMM.

75
00:03:36,801 --> 00:03:39,804
SEEMS LIKE YOU MADE QUITE
A STIR ON AIR TEMPLE ISLAND.

76
00:03:39,929 --> 00:03:42,306
THE COPS ARE
SWARMING THE CITY LOOKING FOR US.

77
00:03:43,141 --> 00:03:45,727
YOU STILL WANT TO TRY
TO TAKE OUT THE PRESIDENT?

78
00:03:45,935 --> 00:03:47,937
NO.
HE'LL HAVE TO WAIT.

79
00:03:48,062 --> 00:03:49,188
WE LEAVE TODAY.

80
00:03:56,487 --> 00:03:58,156
THERE'S OUR TICKET
OUT OF HERE.

81
00:04:09,417 --> 00:04:12,086
THERE'S NO MONEY.
I JUST MADE MY LAST DELIVERY.

82
00:04:12,170 --> 00:04:13,963
- WE DON'T WANT MONEY.

83
00:04:21,971 --> 00:04:24,182
HOW MANY OF THOSE THINGS
ARE YOU GONNA STICK IN ME?

84
00:04:24,515 --> 00:04:26,017
I'LL BE PLACING
SEVERAL NEEDLES

85
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:28,144
ON EACH OF YOUR ACUPOINTS.

86
00:04:28,686 --> 00:04:30,730
THERE'S NOTHING
TO BE SCARED ABOUT.

87
00:04:31,022 --> 00:04:32,315
- I'M NOT AFRAID OF NEEDLES!

88
00:04:32,398 --> 00:04:36,694
PLEASE CLOSE YOUR EYES
AND TAKE A DEEP BREATH.

89
00:04:44,076 --> 00:04:47,163
THIS PROCESS WILL CORRECT
THE IMBALANCES

90
00:04:47,246 --> 00:04:48,623
IN YOUR CHI.

91
00:04:48,706 --> 00:04:51,751
PLEASE TELL ME
IF YOU FEEL ANY PAIN OR PRESSURE.

92
00:04:52,627 --> 00:04:54,337
- I CAN'T FEEL A THING.

93
00:04:54,587 --> 00:04:56,172
- THAT'S UNUSUAL.

94
00:04:56,464 --> 00:04:59,008
YOUR CHI MUST BE
POWERFULLY BLOCKED.

95
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:01,677
WE'RE GOING TO NEED
MORE NEEDLES.

96
00:05:03,596 --> 00:05:05,473
ACUPUNCTURE
OFTEN TAPS

97
00:05:05,556 --> 00:05:07,767
INTO PEOPLE'S
BURIED MEMORIES.

98
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:11,437
THESE MEMORIES CAN
SOMETIMES BE DIFFICULT TO PROCESS.

99
00:05:12,188 --> 00:05:14,899
BURIED MEMORIES, UH-HUH.

100
00:05:21,614 --> 00:05:23,324
SU, WHAT ARE YOU DOING HOME?

101
00:05:23,783 --> 00:05:24,951
WOW.

102
00:05:25,034 --> 00:05:26,786
YOU ALMOST LOOK LIKE
A REAL COP.

103
00:05:27,578 --> 00:05:29,497
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE
IN SCHOOL.

104
00:05:29,622 --> 00:05:31,541
OH, NO.
ARE YOU GONNA TELL MOM?

105
00:05:31,666 --> 00:05:33,125
IT'S NOT LIKE
SHE'S GOING TO CARE.

106
00:05:33,668 --> 00:05:35,044
WHERE'D YOU GET
ALL THAT STUFF?

107
00:05:35,211 --> 00:05:37,088
UH, FELL OFF THE BACK
OF A TRUCK.

108
00:05:37,213 --> 00:05:39,841
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
HANGING OUT WITH THESE LOSERS?

109
00:05:40,424 --> 00:05:43,302
THEY'RE MY FRIENDS, AND YOU HAVE NO
RIGHT TO CALL THEM THAT!

110
00:05:44,303 --> 00:05:46,222
COME ON, GUYS,
LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.

111
00:05:46,931 --> 00:05:48,307
- SU, STOP!

112
00:05:48,432 --> 00:05:50,518
- GET YOUR HANDS OFF OF ME!

113
00:05:50,810 --> 00:05:53,271
YOU HAVE SO MUCH POTENTIAL.
YOU'RE RUINING YOUR LIFE.

114
00:05:53,729 --> 00:05:55,231
- AT LEAST I HAVE A LIFE.

115
00:06:04,782 --> 00:06:07,285
THESE METEORITES ARE PERFECT
FOR BEGINNING METALBENDERS.

116
00:06:07,451 --> 00:06:09,036
THE METALS HAVE
A UNIQUE PROPERTY,

117
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,955
MAKING THEM EASIER TO BEND.

118
00:06:20,715 --> 00:06:22,049
- THAT'S AMAZING.

119
00:06:23,134 --> 00:06:24,802
- HERE, TRY IT.

120
00:06:25,636 --> 00:06:26,846
- OKAY.

121
00:06:37,189 --> 00:06:38,941
BOLIN, IS THAT YOU?

122
00:06:39,901 --> 00:06:41,903
- NO.
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

123
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:46,115
OH, HEY, LADIES.
I WAS JUST, UH...

124
00:06:46,198 --> 00:06:48,826
I WAS JUST LOOKING FOR PABU.
PABU!

125
00:06:48,993 --> 00:06:50,286
- HE'S ON YOUR SHOULDER.

126
00:06:52,246 --> 00:06:53,414
OH, LOOK,
THERE YOU ARE.

127
00:06:53,497 --> 00:06:55,958
YOU KNOW, I THOUGHT
SOMETHING WAS CHEWING ON MY EAR.

128
00:06:56,042 --> 00:06:57,418
I'M PROBABLY GONNA NEED
TO GET A SHOT.

129
00:06:57,501 --> 00:06:59,503
PABU HAS SORT
OF A VENOM... A VENOM.

130
00:06:59,629 --> 00:07:01,422
ANYWAY, SO WHAT ARE
YOU GUYS DOING?

131
00:07:01,505 --> 00:07:03,132
YOU'RE METALBENDING OVER HERE
OR SOMETHING?

132
00:07:03,215 --> 00:07:05,509
- WANT TO GIVE IT A SHOT?
- NAH, IT'S OKAY.

133
00:07:05,593 --> 00:07:08,220
I MEAN, ONLY, LIKE, ONE EARTHBENDER
IN A HUNDRED CAN METALBEND.

134
00:07:08,763 --> 00:07:10,306
WELL, DON'T BELIEVE
EVERYTHING YOU HEAR.

135
00:07:10,389 --> 00:07:12,934
THE ONLY THING LIMITING YOU
IS YOUR ATTITUDE.

136
00:07:13,017 --> 00:07:14,518
YOU KNOW, WELL,
MAYBE I'LL JUST...

137
00:07:14,644 --> 00:07:16,354
I'LL JUST STAY AND WATCH.

138
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:31,077
TRY TO FOCUS
ON THE FINE PIECES OF EARTH

139
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,787
WITHIN THE METAL.

140
00:07:39,085 --> 00:07:41,754
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.
I'M METALBENDING!

141
00:07:42,046 --> 00:07:45,216
WOW, YOU PICKED THAT UP
REALLY, REALLY QUICK.

142
00:07:45,841 --> 00:07:47,718
I GUESS YOU'RE THAT ONE
IN A HUNDRED.

143
00:07:48,761 --> 00:07:50,513
- GREAT JOB, KORRA.

144
00:07:57,561 --> 00:07:58,854
- Man: CALLING ALL UNITS.

145
00:07:58,938 --> 00:08:00,773
ROBBERY REPORTED ON THE CORNER
OF FIFTH AND HARBOR.

146
00:08:00,856 --> 00:08:03,317
SUSPECTS' VEHICLE HEADED SOUTH
ON HAO BOULEVARD.

147
00:08:03,401 --> 00:08:05,528
UNITS RESPONDING, IDENTIFY.

148
00:08:05,736 --> 00:08:06,988
- UNIT THREE RESPONDING.

149
00:08:35,016 --> 00:08:36,350
- Su: LEAVE THEM ALONE!

150
00:08:38,728 --> 00:08:39,812
- SU?

151
00:08:48,654 --> 00:08:49,739
- WAIT.

152
00:08:49,822 --> 00:08:52,158
LEAVING IN THE MIDDLE OF
A SESSION COULD MAKE YOU SICK.

153
00:08:52,283 --> 00:08:53,367
- I'M DONE HERE.

154
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:04,628
ARE YOU GONNA STAY
IN YOUR ROOM

155
00:09:04,712 --> 00:09:06,130
FEELING SORRY
FOR YOURSELF ALL DAY?

156
00:09:08,799 --> 00:09:10,051
YOU OWE OPAL AN APOLOGY...

157
00:09:10,134 --> 00:09:12,344
FOR THE WAY
YOU TREATED HER LAST NIGHT.

158
00:09:13,429 --> 00:09:14,889
ARE YOU OKAY?

159
00:09:14,972 --> 00:09:16,849
YOU DON'T LOOK GOOD.
- I'M FINE.

160
00:09:24,273 --> 00:09:26,317
WHAT DID YOU DO TO ME?

161
00:09:26,901 --> 00:09:28,778
- I TRIED TO WARN YOU.

162
00:09:30,571 --> 00:09:33,074
COME WITH ME.
LET'S GO FINISH THE SESSION.

163
00:09:36,285 --> 00:09:38,913
JUST RELAX AND BREATHE.

164
00:09:42,083 --> 00:09:44,794
SO YOU'RE ROBBING STORES
WITH THE TERRA TRIAD NOW?

165
00:09:45,044 --> 00:09:47,671
I DIDN'T STEAL ANYTHING.
I JUST DROVE THE CAR.

166
00:09:47,838 --> 00:09:50,007
I OWED MY FRIENDS A FAVOR.
IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL.

167
00:09:50,341 --> 00:09:52,134
I'M NOT LETTING YOU
GET AWAY WITH THIS.

168
00:09:52,301 --> 00:09:53,385
OH.

169
00:09:53,469 --> 00:09:55,429
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO,
OFFICER, ARREST ME?

170
00:09:57,515 --> 00:09:59,892
DON'T EVEN
THINK ABOUT TAKING ONE MORE STEP!

171
00:10:35,511 --> 00:10:37,721
GOOD AFTERNOON.
WHERE ARE YOU OFF TO TODAY?

172
00:10:37,805 --> 00:10:40,641
I, UH, GOT
A DELIVERY TO MAKE IN BAO YU.

173
00:10:41,016 --> 00:10:42,893
I SHOULD BE BACK
LATER TODAY.

174
00:10:45,187 --> 00:10:46,313
- YOU ALL RIGHT?

175
00:10:46,397 --> 00:10:48,149
- YEAH, JUST A LITTLE TIRED.

176
00:10:48,732 --> 00:10:50,651
ONE MORE PICKUP,
THEN I'M CLOCKING OUT.

177
00:10:50,901 --> 00:10:52,653
I THOUGHT YOU SAID
YOU HAD A DELIVERY.

178
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:55,656
- DID I?

179
00:10:56,949 --> 00:10:59,034
I'M GONNA NEED YOU
TO STEP OUT OF THE VEHICLE

180
00:10:59,118 --> 00:11:00,953
AND OPEN THE BACK
OF THE TRUCK.

181
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:11,505
- HEY, GET BACK HERE!

182
00:11:19,972 --> 00:11:21,515
- LET'S GET OUT OF HERE!

183
00:12:10,439 --> 00:12:11,690
HMM, HMM.

184
00:12:18,447 --> 00:12:19,907
Cpal: HEY, BOLIN.

185
00:12:20,866 --> 00:12:22,910
OPAL!
OH, WOW.

186
00:12:22,993 --> 00:12:25,496
YOU REALLY
KNOW HOW TO SNEAK UP ON SOMEONE.

187
00:12:25,704 --> 00:12:26,830
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

188
00:12:26,914 --> 00:12:28,666
OH, NOTHING,
YOU KNOW, JUST...

189
00:12:28,832 --> 00:12:33,003
JUST THINKING ABOUT MY BODY AND
MUSTACHES THAT I MIGHT HAVE

190
00:12:33,462 --> 00:12:34,964
IN THE FUTURE.

191
00:12:36,006 --> 00:12:37,883
- YOU'RE ACTING WEIRD AGAIN.

192
00:12:37,967 --> 00:12:39,426
SORRY.

193
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:42,346
I WASN'T REALLY THINKING
ABOUT ALL MY MUSTACHES.

194
00:12:42,429 --> 00:12:44,223
I'M JUST...
I'M JUST FRUSTRATED.

195
00:12:44,682 --> 00:12:47,309
I'VE BEEN TRYING TO METALBEND,
AND I CAN'T FIGURE IT OUT.

196
00:12:47,851 --> 00:12:49,770
DON'T TELL ANYONE, OKAY?

197
00:12:49,937 --> 00:12:52,731
- WHY NOT?
- BECAUSE IT'S EMBARRASSING.

198
00:12:53,065 --> 00:12:54,441
THIS ISN'T THE FIRST TIME
I'VE TRIED.

199
00:12:54,525 --> 00:12:56,110
I MEAN, I'VE BEEN WANTING
TO METALBEND

200
00:12:56,193 --> 00:12:57,987
EVER SINCE I HEARD ABOUT TOPH.

201
00:12:58,529 --> 00:13:01,198
YOUR GRANDMOTHER
IS MY BIGGEST HERO.

202
00:13:02,032 --> 00:13:03,909
MY MOM GREW UP
LEARNING FROM TOPH.

203
00:13:03,993 --> 00:13:06,912
JUST GO TRAIN WITH HER.
STOP BEING SO SCARED.

204
00:13:07,079 --> 00:13:08,163
- YOU KNOW WHAT?

205
00:13:08,247 --> 00:13:09,623
MAYBE I AM SCARED,
BUT WHAT ABOUT YOU?

206
00:13:09,873 --> 00:13:11,250
I KNOW THAT YOU WANT TO GO

207
00:13:11,333 --> 00:13:13,210
TO THE NORTHERN AIR TEMPLE
TO TRAIN WITH TENZIN,

208
00:13:13,294 --> 00:13:15,713
BUT YOU HAVEN'T DONE IT
BECAUSE YOU'RE AFRAID, TOO.

209
00:13:16,547 --> 00:13:18,507
YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU'RE RIGHT.

210
00:13:19,049 --> 00:13:20,301
I DON'T WANT TO
LEAVE MY FAMILY

211
00:13:20,384 --> 00:13:21,969
AND DISAPPOINT MY MOM.

212
00:13:23,262 --> 00:13:24,805
- LOOK AT US...

213
00:13:24,888 --> 00:13:28,809
TALKING ABOUT OUR FEELINGS,
SUPPORTING EACH OTHER.

214
00:13:29,768 --> 00:13:31,020
- IT'S NICE.

215
00:13:44,325 --> 00:13:46,076
- WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?

216
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,661
AND WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?

217
00:13:47,911 --> 00:13:50,748
YOU TWO HAVE PUT ME
IN AN IMPOSSIBLE POSITION.

218
00:13:51,081 --> 00:13:52,166
- YOU'RE MAD AT ME?

219
00:13:52,249 --> 00:13:54,376
SHE'S THE ONE WHO WAS
RUNNING AROUND WITH CRIMINALS.

220
00:13:54,626 --> 00:13:56,086
- THIS IS ALL YOUR FAULT!

221
00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:57,504
- I WAS DOING MY JOB!

222
00:13:57,588 --> 00:14:01,008
UGH, ALL RIGHT, ENOUGH!
HERE'S WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO.

223
00:14:01,175 --> 00:14:04,345
SU, YOU NEED TO LEAVE THE CITY
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

224
00:14:04,428 --> 00:14:06,472
WHAT?
WHERE AM I SUPPOSED TO GO?

225
00:14:06,805 --> 00:14:08,682
YOU'LL GO STAY
WITH YOUR GRANDPARENTS.

226
00:14:08,766 --> 00:14:10,684
LIN, GIVE ME
THE ARREST REPORT.

227
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:16,523
MOM, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

228
00:14:16,732 --> 00:14:19,276
YOU CAN'T COVER THIS UP.
THERE WERE WITNESSES.

229
00:14:19,443 --> 00:14:21,111
- I'M THE CHIEF OF POLICE.

230
00:14:21,195 --> 00:14:23,113
I CAN'T HAVE A DAUGHTER
IN JAIL.

231
00:14:23,489 --> 00:14:25,866
SO, ONCE AGAIN,
SU GETS TO DO WHATEVER SHE WANTS,

232
00:14:25,949 --> 00:14:27,826
AND THERE ARE
NO CONSEQUENCES.

233
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:32,247
THIS IS OUR ONLY OPTION.

234
00:14:36,627 --> 00:14:38,754
YOU'RE GOING TO FEEL
A BIT FRAGILE,

235
00:14:38,837 --> 00:14:40,130
SO IT'S PROBABLY BEST

236
00:14:40,214 --> 00:14:42,424
IF YOU TAKE IT EASY
FOR A LITTLE WHILE.

237
00:14:43,926 --> 00:14:45,219
- I DON'T NEED TO REST.

238
00:14:45,302 --> 00:14:48,305
I NEED TO DO SOMETHING
I SHOULD'VE DONE A LONG TIME AGO.

239
00:14:59,441 --> 00:15:00,651
- CONGRATULATIONS.

240
00:15:00,734 --> 00:15:02,653
YOU'RE THE FIRST
METALBENDING AVATAR.

241
00:15:04,988 --> 00:15:08,283
SO, UM,
I'VE BEEN THINKING,

242
00:15:09,159 --> 00:15:11,453
AND I'D LIKE TO TRY
TO LEARN METALBENDING.

243
00:15:11,954 --> 00:15:13,414
I MEAN, I'M SURE YOU HAVE

244
00:15:13,497 --> 00:15:15,666
A WAITING LIST OR SOMETHING,
LIKE, A COUPLE YEARS, SO...

245
00:15:16,166 --> 00:15:17,668
- LET'S GET STARTED.

246
00:15:24,091 --> 00:15:27,344
I THINK LIN IS MAD
ABOUT SOMETHING.

247
00:15:28,011 --> 00:15:30,139
- SU, IT'S TIME WE TALK.

248
00:15:36,687 --> 00:15:39,523
AFTER 30 YEARS,
YOU'RE FINALLY READY TO TALK?

249
00:15:39,606 --> 00:15:41,316
WHEN WE WERE IN MOM'S OFFICE
THAT DAY,

250
00:15:41,483 --> 00:15:43,944
YOU COULD HAVE TAKEN
RESPONSIBILITY FOR WHAT YOU DID,

251
00:15:44,153 --> 00:15:45,487
BUT INSTEAD YOU STAYED QUIET

252
00:15:45,571 --> 00:15:47,448
AND LET MOM
THROW HER WHOLE CAREER AWAY.

253
00:15:47,531 --> 00:15:48,949
MOM DIDN'T THROW
HER CAREER AWAY.

254
00:15:49,032 --> 00:15:51,869
SHE RETIRED THE NEXT YEAR.
SHE WAS A HERO.

255
00:15:51,952 --> 00:15:53,787
YOU THINK
SHE WANTED TO RETIRE?

256
00:15:54,037 --> 00:15:56,415
SHE WAS SO GUILT-RIDDEN ABOUT
WHAT SHE DID TO PROTECT YOU,

257
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:58,292
SHE DIDN'T FEEL WORTHY
OF HER BADGE.

258
00:15:58,375 --> 00:16:00,377
LOOK, I ADMIT
THAT I WAS NOT A PERFECT KID

259
00:16:00,461 --> 00:16:02,337
AND I'VE MADE SOME MISTAKES
IN THE PAST, BUT...

260
00:16:02,421 --> 00:16:05,132
YOU MADE SOME MISTAKES?

261
00:16:05,466 --> 00:16:08,135
LIN, MOM AND I
ALREADY TALKED ABOUT THIS YEARS AGO

262
00:16:08,218 --> 00:16:09,261
AND WORKED THINGS OUT.

263
00:16:09,344 --> 00:16:11,388
IF YOU HAD GOTTEN TOGETHER
WITH US LIKE WE'D ASKED,

264
00:16:11,555 --> 00:16:13,557
YOU WOULD KNOW
THAT I'M A DIFFERENT PERSON NOW.

265
00:16:13,682 --> 00:16:16,393
I'VE BEEN A DIFFERENT PERSON
FOR A LONG TIME.

266
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,896
YOU THINK JUST BECAUSE
YOU LIVE IN A BIG, FANCY HOUSE

267
00:16:19,021 --> 00:16:20,856
AND HAVE A CHEF
WHO COOKS YOU FANCY FOOD

268
00:16:20,939 --> 00:16:22,316
THAT YOU'RE
A DIFFERENT PERSON?

269
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:25,068
MAYBE YOU CAN FOOL EVERYONE
ELSE, BUT YOU CAN'T FOOL ME.

270
00:16:25,402 --> 00:16:27,070
I SEE RIGHT THROUGH YOU.

271
00:16:27,237 --> 00:16:28,447
- YOU KNOW WHAT, LIN?

272
00:16:28,530 --> 00:16:29,740
YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO HASN'T CHANGED.

273
00:16:29,823 --> 00:16:32,576
YOU'RE STILL A BITTER LONER
WHO ONLY CARES ABOUT HERSELF.

274
00:16:33,118 --> 00:16:35,329
NO WONDER TENZIN ENDED THINGS
WITH YOU YEARS AGO.

275
00:16:38,832 --> 00:16:41,919
OKAY, I GUESS
THIS IS HOW IT'S GOING TO BE.

276
00:16:58,393 --> 00:17:00,771
- SHOULD I STOP THEM?
- YOU DON'T HAVE ANY SIBLINGS.

277
00:17:00,854 --> 00:17:03,815
FIGHTING IS ALL PART
OF THE HEALING PROCESS.

278
00:17:08,111 --> 00:17:09,488
- GO, MOM!

279
00:17:19,623 --> 00:17:20,999
MY SCULPTURE!

280
00:17:24,878 --> 00:17:27,506
ACTUALLY, IT LOOKS
KIND OF BETTER NOW.

281
00:17:49,861 --> 00:17:52,155
YOU GOT IT
OUT OF YOUR SYSTEM?

282
00:17:52,364 --> 00:17:53,699
- NOT QUITE YET!

283
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:01,665
- WHAT ARE YOU TWO DOING?

284
00:18:01,957 --> 00:18:02,958
YOU'RE SISTERS!

285
00:18:03,041 --> 00:18:04,710
WHY WOULD YOU WANT
TO HURT EACH OTHER?

286
00:18:19,433 --> 00:18:21,893
- UH, WHO'S GONNA KNOCK?

287
00:18:23,562 --> 00:18:25,522
OH! NO, NO, NO,
NO, NO, NO. NOT ME.

288
00:18:25,647 --> 00:18:27,774
YOU'RE THE AVATAR.
WHY CAN'T YOU DO IT?

289
00:18:27,941 --> 00:18:29,985
- UH, I CAN.

290
00:18:30,235 --> 00:18:31,653
BUT I JUST THOUGHT
THAT YOU...

291
00:18:31,737 --> 00:18:33,113
- I'LL DO IT.

292
00:18:34,698 --> 00:18:38,452
UH, CHIEF,
YOU'VE BEEN SLEEPING FOR 16 HOURS.

293
00:18:39,077 --> 00:18:40,662
WE JUST WANTED TO
MAKE SURE THAT YOU'RE OKAY.

294
00:18:40,746 --> 00:18:41,955
OOH!

295
00:18:47,628 --> 00:18:49,296
GOOD MORNING.

296
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:57,804
WHAT'S THIS?

297
00:18:57,888 --> 00:18:59,598
- I CALL IT THE KALENUTSCO.

298
00:18:59,765 --> 00:19:02,726
IT'S A MIXTURE OF KALE,
COCONUT WATER, AND WALNUTS.

299
00:19:10,067 --> 00:19:11,401
- NOT BAD.

300
00:19:13,236 --> 00:19:14,780
OPAL, DON'T GO.

301
00:19:15,947 --> 00:19:18,784
PLEASE SIT DOWN.
I WANT TO TALK TO YOU.

302
00:19:26,249 --> 00:19:28,293
LOOK, I'M JUST NOT
REALLY COMFORTABLE

303
00:19:28,377 --> 00:19:30,045
TALKING ABOUT THESE KINDS
OF THINGS,

304
00:19:30,128 --> 00:19:31,588
AND, WELL...

305
00:19:32,339 --> 00:19:34,341
I WANTED TO SAY I'M SORRY
ABOUT THE OTHER NIGHT.

306
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:36,677
- IT'S OKAY.

307
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:40,263
YOUR MOTHER AND I HAVE
A COMPLICATED RELATIONSHIP AND...

308
00:19:40,347 --> 00:19:43,141
IT'S PROBABLY DIFFICULT
FOR YOU TO BE HERE.

309
00:19:44,768 --> 00:19:48,271
YOU'RE A SMART YOUNG WOMAN
AND AN EXCELLENT AIRBENDER.

310
00:19:48,814 --> 00:19:50,315
I THINK IT WOULD BE
A WONDERFUL OPPORTUNITY

311
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:51,608
FOR YOU TO TRAIN

312
00:19:51,692 --> 00:19:54,277
WITH THE OTHER AIRBENDERS
AT THE NORTHERN AIR TEMPLE.

313
00:19:54,528 --> 00:19:56,196
THERE'S A PART OF ME
THAT WANTS TO GO,

314
00:19:56,279 --> 00:19:58,657
BUT I DON'T WANT
TO UPSET MY MOM.

315
00:19:59,491 --> 00:20:00,534
- WHEN I WAS YOUNGER,

316
00:20:00,617 --> 00:20:02,285
ALL I WANTED TO DO
WAS PLEASE MY MOTHER.

317
00:20:03,036 --> 00:20:04,162
I BECAME A POLICE CHIEF

318
00:20:04,246 --> 00:20:05,872
BECAUSE I THOUGHT
IT WOULD MAKE HER HAPPY,

319
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:07,582
BUT IT DIDN'T.

320
00:20:07,874 --> 00:20:10,460
YOU NEED TO MAKE DECISIONS
BASED ON WHAT YOU WANT.

321
00:20:10,961 --> 00:20:13,130
DON'T MAKE
THE SAME MISTAKES I DID.

322
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:23,306
- MOM? DAD?

323
00:20:24,141 --> 00:20:25,726
CAN I TALK TO YOU?

324
00:20:36,611 --> 00:20:39,322
OPAL HAS DECIDED TO GO
TO THE NORTHERN AIR TEMPLE.

325
00:20:39,531 --> 00:20:41,742
I'M GUESSING YOU HAD SOMETHING
TO DO WITH HER DECISION.

326
00:20:41,825 --> 00:20:42,826
- WELL, I WAS JUST...

327
00:20:42,909 --> 00:20:45,746
IT'S OKAY.
I'M GLAD SHE WAS HONEST WITH ME.

328
00:20:46,037 --> 00:20:48,248
I WANT HER TO DO
WHAT MAKES HER HAPPY.

329
00:20:49,207 --> 00:20:50,959
MOM GAVE US
TOO MUCH FREEDOM,

330
00:20:51,209 --> 00:20:52,461
BUT I FEEL LIKE
I'VE MADE THE MISTAKE

331
00:20:52,544 --> 00:20:54,254
OF GIVING OPAL TOO LITTLE.

332
00:20:54,504 --> 00:20:56,798
I THINK IT'S TIME
I LET HER CHOOSE HER OWN WAY.

333
00:20:57,841 --> 00:20:59,176
I'M SORRY I GAVE YOU
SUCH A HARD TIME

334
00:20:59,259 --> 00:21:00,635
WHEN WE WERE YOUNGER.

335
00:21:01,136 --> 00:21:03,013
I CAN'T IMAGINE
WHAT MY LIFE WOULD'VE BEEN LIKE

336
00:21:03,096 --> 00:21:06,141
IF MOM HADN'T SENT ME AWAY,
IF I HAD STAYED IN THE CITY.

337
00:21:06,308 --> 00:21:07,684
YOU'D PROBABLY BE
IN PRISON.

338
00:21:07,809 --> 00:21:10,270
YOU'RE PROBABLY RIGHT.

339
00:21:10,979 --> 00:21:13,315
MAKO TOLD ME THAT YOU'RE
AN EXCELLENT POLICE CHIEF.

340
00:21:13,482 --> 00:21:15,484
REPUBLIC CITY IS LUCKY
TO HAVE YOU.

341
00:21:16,193 --> 00:21:17,986
I KNOW MOM IS PROUD.

342
00:21:22,616 --> 00:21:23,950
CAN WE MOVE ON?

343
00:21:24,034 --> 00:21:26,077
I'D LOVE FOR YOU TO BE
A PART OF MY LIFE AGAIN.

344
00:21:26,369 --> 00:21:27,829
THERE'S PLENTY
OF SPACE FOR YOU IN THE HOUSE,

345
00:21:27,913 --> 00:21:30,290
AND THE KIDS WOULD LOVE
HAVING THEIR AUNT AROUND.

346
00:21:30,582 --> 00:21:33,543
I DO NEED A CO-DIRECTOR
FOR MY NEW DANCE PERFORMANCE.

347
00:21:33,752 --> 00:21:35,796
WHOA.
SLOW DOWN.

348
00:21:36,087 --> 00:21:38,131
HOW ABOUT FOR NOW,
I JUST PROMISE

349
00:21:38,215 --> 00:21:40,342
NOT TO SHOW UP AT YOUR HOUSE
AND ATTACK YOU AGAIN?

350
00:21:40,801 --> 00:21:42,010
- DEAL.

351
00:21:53,396 --> 00:21:55,273
WE SHOULD'VE GRABBED
ONE OF THOSE COPS.

352
00:21:55,357 --> 00:21:56,483
MAYBE THEY KNOW SOMETHING

353
00:21:56,566 --> 00:21:57,943
ABOUT WHERE THE AVATAR
IS HIDING.

354
00:21:58,026 --> 00:22:00,987
- SHE COULD BE ANYWHERE.
- WE'LL FIND HER.

355
00:22:02,155 --> 00:22:04,074
IT'S JUST A MATTER OF TIME.

356
00:22:08,703 --> 00:22:10,372
- SHE'S WITH THE METAL CLAN.
