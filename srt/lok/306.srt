- NOT BAD.

344
00:19:18,709 --> 00:19:21,208
OPAL, DON'T GO.

345
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:24,125
PLEASE SIT DOWN.
I WANT TO TALK TO YOU.

346
00:19:31,792 --> 00:19:34,166
LOOK, I'M JUST NOT
REALLY COMFORTABLE

347
00:19:34,208 --> 00:19:35,625
TALKING ABOUT THESE KINDS
OF THINGS,

348
00:19:35,667 --> 00:19:37,834
AND, WELL...

349
00:19:37,875 --> 00:19:40,834
I WANTED TO SAY I'M SORRY
ABOUT THE OTHER NIGHT.

350
00:19:40,875 --> 00:19:42,375
- IT'S OKAY.

351
00:19:42,417 --> 00:19:45,792
- YOUR MOTHER AND I HAVE
A COMPLICATED RELATIONSHIP AND--

352
00:19:45,834 --> 00:19:48,125
- IT'S PROBABLY DIFFICULT
FOR YOU TO BE HERE.

353
00:19:50,375 --> 00:19:54,542
- YOU'RE A SMART YOUNG WOMAN
AND AN EXCELLENT AIRBENDER.

354
00:19:54,583 --> 00:19:57,125
I THINK IT WOULD BE A WONDERFUL
OPPORTUNITY FOR YOU TO TRAIN

355
00:19:57,166 --> 00:19:59,959
WITH THE OTHER AIRBENDERS
AT THE NORTHERN AIR TEMPLE.

356
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,709
- THERE'S A PART OF ME
THAT WANTS TO GO,

357
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:05,000
BUT I DON'T WANT
TO UPSET MY MOM.

358
00:20:05,041 --> 00:20:06,333
- WHEN I WAS YOUNGER,

359
00:20:06,375 --> 00:20:08,417
ALL I WANTED TO DO
WAS PLEASE MY MOTHER.

360
00:20:08,458 --> 00:20:09,709
I BECAME A POLICE CHIEF

361
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:11,792
BECAUSE I THOUGHT
IT WOULD MAKE HER HAPPY,

362
00:20:11,834 --> 00:20:13,500
BUT IT DIDN'T.

363
00:20:13,542 --> 00:20:16,500
YOU NEED TO MAKE DECISIONS
BASED ON WHAT YOU WANT.

364
00:20:16,542 --> 00:20:18,542
DON'T MAKE THE SAME MISTAKES
I DID.

365
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:28,959
- MOM? DAD?

366
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,417
CAN I TALK TO YOU?

367
00:20:42,333 --> 00:20:45,000
- OPAL HAS DECIDED TO GO
TO THE NORTHERN AIR TEMPLE.

368
00:20:45,041 --> 00:20:47,041
I'M GUESSING YOU HAD SOMETHING
TO DO WITH HER DECISION.

369
00:20:47,083 --> 00:20:48,834
- WELL, I WAS JUST--

370
00:20:48,875 --> 00:20:51,417
- IT'S OKAY.
I'M GLAD SHE WAS HONEST WITH ME.

371
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:54,417
I WANT HER TO DO
WHAT MAKES HER HAPPY.

372
00:20:54,458 --> 00:20:56,542
MOM GAVE US
TOO MUCH FREEDOM,

373
00:20:56,583 --> 00:20:58,083
BUT I FEEL LIKE
I'VE MADE THE MISTAKE

374
00:20:58,125 --> 00:20:59,959
OF GIVING OPAL TOO LITTLE.

375
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,458
I THINK IT'S TIME
I LET HER CHOOSE HER OWN WAY.

376
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:06,083
I'M SORRY I GAVE YOU SUCH A HARD
TIME WHEN WE WERE YOUNGER.

377
00:21:06,125 --> 00:21:08,625
I CAN'T IMAGINE WHAT MY LIFE
WOULD'VE BEEN LIKE

378
00:21:08,667 --> 00:21:11,542
IF MOM HADN'T SENT ME AWAY,
IF I HAD STAYED IN THE CITY.

379
00:21:11,583 --> 00:21:13,291
- YOU'D PROBABLY BE
IN PRISON.

380
00:21:13,333 --> 00:21:16,333
- [chuckles]
YOU'RE PROBABLY RIGHT.

381
00:21:16,375 --> 00:21:18,834
MAKO TOLD ME THAT YOU'RE
AN EXCELLENT POLICE CHIEF.

382
00:21:18,875 --> 00:21:21,458
REPUBLIC CITY IS LUCKY
TO HAVE YOU.

383
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:23,834
I KNOW MOM IS PROUD.

384
00:21:28,834 --> 00:21:30,083
CAN WE MOVE ON?

385
00:21:30,125 --> 00:21:31,834
I'D LOVE FOR YOU TO BE
A PART OF MY LIFE AGAIN.

386
00:21:31,875 --> 00:21:33,458
THERE'S PLENTY OF SPACE FOR YOU
IN THE HOUSE,

387
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:36,083
AND THE KIDS WOULD LOVE
HAVING THEIR AUNT AROUND.

388
00:21:36,125 --> 00:21:39,041
I DO NEED A CODIRECTOR
FOR MY NEW DANCE PERFORMANCE.

389
00:21:39,083 --> 00:21:41,333
- WHOA.
SLOW DOWN.

390
00:21:41,375 --> 00:21:43,625
HOW ABOUT FOR NOW,
I JUST PROMISE

391
00:21:43,667 --> 00:21:46,083
NOT TO SHOW UP AT YOUR HOUSE
AND ATTACK YOU AGAIN?

392
00:21:46,125 --> 00:21:48,208
- DEAL.

393
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,709
- WE SHOULD'VE GRABBED
ONE OF THOSE COPS.

394
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:03,875
MAYBE THEY KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT
WHERE THE AVATAR IS HIDING.

395
00:22:03,917 --> 00:22:08,208
- SHE COULD BE ANYWHERE.
- WE'LL FIND HER.

396
00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:09,625
IT'S JUST A MATTER OF TIME.

397
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:16,625
- SHE'S WITH THE METAL CLAN.
