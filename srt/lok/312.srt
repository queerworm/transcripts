1
00:00:07,667 --> 00:00:09,166
- EARTH.

2
00:00:09,208 --> 00:00:10,291
FIRE.

3
00:00:10,333 --> 00:00:12,125
AIR.

4
00:00:12,166 --> 00:00:14,375
WATER.

5
00:00:14,417 --> 00:00:18,500
ONLY THE AVATAR
CAN MASTER ALL FOUR ELEMENTS

6
00:00:18,542 --> 00:00:21,917
AND BRING BALANCE TO THE WORLD.

7
00:00:27,166 --> 00:00:29,166
- THE NEW AIR NATION
IS IN JEOPARDY.

8
00:00:29,208 --> 00:00:31,333
IN AN EFFORT TO FORCE KORRA
TO SURRENDER HERSELF,

9
00:00:31,375 --> 00:00:33,208
ZAHEER AMBUSHED
THE NORTHERN AIR TEMPLE.

10
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:36,417
TENZIN, BUMI AND KYA ATTEMPTED
TO HOLD OFF THE RED LOTUS

11
00:00:36,458 --> 00:00:37,959
BUT WERE INJURED IN BATTLE.

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,208
THE AIRBENDERS WERE UNABLE
TO ESCAPE

13
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:41,625
AND EVERYONE WAS TAKEN CAPTIVE,

14
00:00:41,667 --> 00:00:43,000
EXCEPT KAI.

15
00:00:43,041 --> 00:00:45,333
NOW KORRA AND TEAM AVATAR RACE
TO THE TEMPLE,

16
00:00:45,375 --> 00:00:47,166
HOPING TO MOUNT A RESCUE.

17
00:00:56,875 --> 00:00:58,542
- I SAY WE MAKE OUR APPROACH
FROM THE WEST.

18
00:00:58,583 --> 00:01:01,041
DROP DOWN FROM THE AIRSHIP
ON CABLES.

19
00:01:01,083 --> 00:01:04,041
AMBUSH THESE RED LOTUS LOWLIFES
BEFORE THEY KNOW WHAT HIT THEM.

20
00:01:04,083 --> 00:01:05,834
- IT'LL NEVER WORK.

21
00:01:05,875 --> 00:01:08,542
THAT COMBUSTION LADY
WILL PICK US OFF ONE BY ONE.

22
00:01:08,583 --> 00:01:11,083
- YOU HAVE A BETTER IDEA
HOW TO SAVE THE AIRBENDERS?

23
00:01:11,125 --> 00:01:12,166
- YEAH.

24
00:01:12,208 --> 00:01:13,625
WE COME UP FROM THE VALLEY,

25
00:01:13,667 --> 00:01:15,458
SCALE THE SIDE OF THE MOUNTAIN,
AND TAKE THEM OFF GUARD.

26
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:16,667
- THAT COULD WORK.

27
00:01:16,709 --> 00:01:19,041
- AND GIVE THEM
THE HIGH GROUND? NO.

28
00:01:19,083 --> 00:01:20,667
IF THEIR LAVABENDER SPOTS US,

29
00:01:20,709 --> 00:01:21,917
HE'LL MELT THE MOUNTAINSIDE
AND US WITH IT.

30
00:01:21,959 --> 00:01:23,250
- WAIT! I GOT IT.

31
00:01:23,291 --> 00:01:25,125
I'LL DISGUISE MYSELF
AS A LOST HIKER.

32
00:01:25,166 --> 00:01:27,083
AND ONCE I'M IN THE TEMPLE,
I'LL DISTRACT THE RED LOTUS

33
00:01:27,125 --> 00:01:28,375
WITH MY BIRD CALLS.

34
00:01:28,417 --> 00:01:30,208
[whistles a bird call]

35
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:31,625
CAW! CAW!

36

[whistles a bird call]

37
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,542
CAW! CAW!

38
00:01:34,583 --> 00:01:36,959
THAT'S WHEN YOU ALL STRIKE!

39
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
- BIRD CALLS?

40
00:01:38,041 --> 00:01:40,792
REALLY?

41
00:01:40,834 --> 00:01:44,000
- WELL, I HAVEN'T NOTICED YOU
OFFERING ANY SUGGESTIONS.

42
00:01:44,041 --> 00:01:46,792
- IT DOESN'T MATTER. NONE OF
THESE IDEAS WILL WORK.

43
00:01:46,834 --> 00:01:49,000
THE SECOND ZAHEER REALIZES
WE'RE UP TO SOMETHING,

44
00:01:49,041 --> 00:01:50,709
HE'LL WIPE OUT THE AIRBENDERS.

45
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:53,125
- AND OPAL IS ONE
OF THOSE AIRBENDERS.

46
00:01:53,166 --> 00:01:55,667
BELIEVE ME, I UNDERSTAND
WHAT'S AT STAKE.

47
00:01:55,709 --> 00:01:57,417
- THEN I THINK YOU'LL AGREE.

48
00:01:57,458 --> 00:02:00,709
THE ONLY PLAN THAT WILL WORK
IS FOR ME TO GIVE MYSELF UP.

49
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:02,166
- WHAT?
- KORRA, NO.

50
00:02:02,208 --> 00:02:03,917
- WE'LL FIGURE OUT ANOTHER WAY.

51
00:02:03,959 --> 00:02:05,834
- I TALKED IT OVER
WITH LORD ZUKO,

52
00:02:05,875 --> 00:02:07,333
AND I'VE GIVEN IT
A LOT OF THOUGHT.

53
00:02:07,375 --> 00:02:09,583
I HAVE TO DO THIS.

54
00:02:09,625 --> 00:02:12,583
- YOU CAN'T EXPECT US TO SIT BY
AND JUST LET ZAHEER TAKE YOU.

55
00:02:12,625 --> 00:02:14,917
- THE WORLD HAS BEEN OUT
OF BALANCE FOR FAR TOO LONG.

56
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:16,959
IT NEEDS THE AIR NATION
BACK AGAIN.

57
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,750
I CAN'T LET ZAHEER DESTROY IT
AND EVERYONE WE LOVE.

58
00:02:20,792 --> 00:02:22,875
HELP ME SAVE THE AIRBENDERS.

59
00:02:22,917 --> 00:02:27,208
THEN YOU CAN CAN WORRY
ABOUT SAVING ME.

60
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:28,500
- WE'RE WITH YOU, KORRA.

61
00:02:28,542 --> 00:02:30,166
- YES, WHATEVER YOU NEED.

62
00:02:30,208 --> 00:02:31,542
WE'RE HERE.

63
00:02:31,583 --> 00:02:35,083
- I'LL GO RADIO ZAHEER.

64
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:46,625
[static over radio]

65
00:02:46,667 --> 00:02:48,500
ZAHEER, ARE YOU THERE?

66
00:02:48,542 --> 00:02:51,000
IT'S ME.

67
00:02:51,041 --> 00:02:52,625
- I'VE BEEN WAITING
FOR YOUR CALL.

68
00:02:52,667 --> 00:02:56,083
SO DO WE HAVE A DEAL?
- YES.

69
00:02:56,125 --> 00:02:58,542
YOU RELEASE THE AIRBENDERS,
AND THEN I'LL TURN MYSELF OVER.

70
00:02:58,583 --> 00:03:00,667
- AND TAKE AWAY
THE ONLY LEVERAGE I HAVE?

71
00:03:00,709 --> 00:03:02,041
NO.

72
00:03:02,083 --> 00:03:03,083
I CAN'T DO THAT.

73
00:03:03,125 --> 00:03:04,750
LISTEN CAREFULLY.

74
00:03:04,792 --> 00:03:08,500
HERE'S WHAT I WANT YOU TO DO.

75
00:03:08,542 --> 00:03:11,041
- WILL YOU SIT DOWN?

76
00:03:11,083 --> 00:03:13,000
I'M ALREADY TENSE ENOUGH
AS IT IS!

77
00:03:13,041 --> 00:03:14,959
- I'M JUST WORRIED ABOUT OPAL.

78
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,709
AND PABU'S NOT HERE
TO COMFORT ME.

79
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:19,875
I HOPE HE AND NAGA
ARE DOING OKAY BACK IN ZAOFU.

80
00:03:19,917 --> 00:03:24,667
[Naga growling]
[Pabu squeaking]

81
00:03:27,709 --> 00:03:29,250
- NO.

82
00:03:29,291 --> 00:03:30,875
NOT MAKO'S SCARF!

83
00:03:30,917 --> 00:03:33,500
BAD DOG AND RAT-THINGY!
[Naga whimpers]

84
00:03:33,542 --> 00:03:35,333
I'M VERY DISAPPOINTED
IN YOU TWO.

85
00:03:35,375 --> 00:03:38,834
[animals whine]

86
00:03:47,625 --> 00:03:50,667
- DID YOU SPEAK TO ZAHEER?
- YES.

87
00:03:50,709 --> 00:03:54,750
HE TOLD ME TO COME TO THE TOP OF
LAGHIMA'S PEAK AT NOON. ALONE.

88
00:03:54,792 --> 00:03:58,125
ONCE HE HAS ME, HE'LL RELEASE
THE AIRBENDERS OVER TO YOU

89
00:03:58,166 --> 00:03:59,792
AT THE TEMPLE.

90
00:03:59,834 --> 00:04:01,583
I THINK I FIGURED OUT A WAY
TO PLAY THIS

91
00:04:01,625 --> 00:04:04,625
SO THE AIRBENDERS AND KORRA
ALL COME OUT IN ONE PIECE.

92
00:04:04,667 --> 00:04:06,667
- HOW?

93
00:04:06,709 --> 00:04:08,166
- ZAHEER DOESN'T KNOW
HOW MANY OF US THERE ARE.

94
00:04:08,208 --> 00:04:10,208
SO WE HAVE
THE NUMBERS ADVANTAGE.

95
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,208
I SAY WE SPLIT INTO TWO TEAMS.

96
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:15,500
MAKO, BOLIN AND ASAMI WILL TAKE
THE AIRSHIP UP TO THE TEMPLE.

97
00:04:15,542 --> 00:04:18,417
MEANWHILE, MY METALBENDERS,
TONRAQ, LIN, AND I WILL GET

98
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:22,542
INTO POSITION
BELOW LAGHIMA'S PEAK.

99
00:04:24,875 --> 00:04:26,417
- LET GO YOUR EARTHLY TETHER.

100
00:04:26,458 --> 00:04:28,375
ENTER THE VOID.

101
00:04:28,417 --> 00:04:31,250
EMPTY AND BECOME WIND.

102
00:04:31,291 --> 00:04:36,875
EMPTY AND BECOME WIND.

103
00:04:36,917 --> 00:04:39,709
- THE AIRBENDERS ARE SECURE.

104
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:41,333
- THANK YOU, P'LI.

105
00:04:41,375 --> 00:04:42,583
FOR EVERYTHING.

106
00:04:42,625 --> 00:04:44,333
- OF COURSE.

107
00:04:44,375 --> 00:04:46,625
- I WANT YOU TO KNOW,

108
00:04:46,667 --> 00:04:47,959
NOT ONE DAY WENT BY
IN THAT PRISON

109
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,625
WHEN I DIDN'T THINK OF YOU.

110
00:04:51,667 --> 00:04:54,458
- THE YEARS APART ONLY MADE
MY LOVE FOR YOU STRONGER.

111
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:57,875
AND, DEEP DOWN, I KNEW YOU'D
FIND A WAY TO GET ME OUT.

112
00:04:57,917 --> 00:05:00,125
JUST LIKE YOU SAVED ME
FROM BECOMING

113
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:02,834
THAT WARLORD'S KILLING MACHINE
WHEN I WAS A GIRL.

114
00:05:02,875 --> 00:05:06,375
YOU'VE SHOWN ME
WHAT TRUE FREEDOM MEANS.

115
00:05:06,417 --> 00:05:08,166
- AND, AFTER TODAY,

116
00:05:08,208 --> 00:05:11,500
WE'LL SHOW THE ENTIRE WORLD
WHAT IT MEANS.

117
00:05:11,542 --> 00:05:12,917
NO MORE PRISONS.

118
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:14,750
NO MORE RUNNING.

119
00:05:14,792 --> 00:05:16,417
- I LOVE YOU, ZAHEER.

120
00:05:16,458 --> 00:05:19,959
- I LOVE YOU TOO.

121
00:05:36,417 --> 00:05:38,000
- RADIO THE SECOND YOU SEE
THOSE AIRBENDERS.

122
00:05:38,041 --> 00:05:39,333
- I WILL, CHIEF.

123
00:05:39,375 --> 00:05:42,417
GOOD LUCK.

[armor clanking]

125
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:48,417
- BE CAREFUL, KORRA.

126
00:05:48,458 --> 00:05:50,166
- YOU TOO.

00:06:13,583 --> 00:06:16,500
I'LL BE ALL RIGHT.

130
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:19,333
- I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW
HOW PROUD I AM OF YOU.

131
00:06:19,375 --> 00:06:21,291
THE RISK YOU'RE TAKING
TO SAVE THE AIR NATION

132
00:06:21,333 --> 00:06:23,333
WILL BE REMEMBERED
FOR GENERATIONS.

133
00:06:23,375 --> 00:06:24,917
- I LOVE YOU, DAD.

134
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:26,959
- I LOVE YOU TOO, SWEETHEART.

135
00:06:32,291 --> 00:06:33,500
- AND, DAD.

136
00:06:33,542 --> 00:06:35,125
WATCH OUT FOR ZAHEER.

137
00:06:35,166 --> 00:06:37,125
HE'S NOT VERY FOND
OF WORLD LEADERS.

138
00:06:37,166 --> 00:06:38,542
- I CAN HANDLE HIM.

139
00:06:38,583 --> 00:06:41,208
JUST STAY FOCUSED
ON YOUR MISSION.

140
00:07:06,208 --> 00:07:08,417
- OH, MAN.

141
00:07:08,458 --> 00:07:10,917
- MUST HAVE BEEN SOME FIGHT.
[static over radio]

142

- MAKO, DO YOU SEE
THE AIRBENDERS?

143
00:07:12,083 --> 00:07:13,166
- NOT YET.

144
00:07:13,208 --> 00:07:15,125
WE'RE JUST ARRIVING.

145
00:07:15,166 --> 00:07:18,375
DON'T TURN YOURSELF OVER
UNTIL I GET A VISUAL ON THEM.

147
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:35,834

AND SURRENDER YOURSELF.

WHAT'S GOING ON?

154

- THEY'RE HERE.

155
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:15,417
BUT SO IS THE LAVABENDER.

156
00:08:15,458 --> 00:08:17,834
- TELL GHAZAN
TO LET THE AIRBENDERS GO.

157

- NOT UNTIL
YOU TURN YOURSELF OVER.

158
00:08:19,792 --> 00:08:23,166
THIS ISN'T A NEGOTIATION.

159
00:08:26,583 --> 00:08:28,125
WIPE THEM OUT.

160

[grunts]

178
00:09:40,333 --> 00:09:41,875
- CHIEF, GET KORRA
OUT OF THERE NOW!

179
00:09:41,917 --> 00:09:45,458
- GO! GO!

180
00:09:48,709 --> 00:09:53,208
- [grunts]

181

[grunts]

182
00:10:13,125 --> 00:10:14,709
- GET THE AVATAR ON THE AIRSHIP.

183
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:18,208
I'LL DEAL WITH THEM.

184
00:10:22,125 --> 00:10:24,166
[both scream]

185
00:10:24,208 --> 00:10:28,125

- [screams]

188
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:11,750
- NOWHERE TO GO, ZAHEER!

189
00:11:23,166 --> 00:11:24,917
- WHERE ARE THE AIRBENDERS?

190
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:26,333
- I DON'T KNOW.

191
00:11:26,375 --> 00:11:28,375
ZAHEER MOVED THEM
OUT OF THE TEMPLE.

192
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:33,125
- WILL YOU JUST BURY THEM
ALREADY?

193
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:53,709
- COME ON.

194
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:55,250
WE HAVE TO GET BACK
TO THE AIRSHIP!

195
00:11:55,291 --> 00:11:57,417
- NOT GONNA HAPPEN!
THE EXIT'S BLOCKED!

196
00:12:08,458 --> 00:12:09,458
[column crashes]

197
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:11,250
- [grunts]

198
00:12:11,291 --> 00:12:14,375
- WHERE'S OOGI?
- GONE.

199
00:12:14,417 --> 00:12:17,291
ALL THE BISON GOT SCARED OFF
DURING THE ATTACK.

200
00:12:17,333 --> 00:12:19,875
BUT I THINK I KNOW
ANOTHER WAY OUT.

201
00:12:19,917 --> 00:12:23,166
BOLIN, CAN YOU GET US
THROUGH THAT WALL?

202
00:12:23,208 --> 00:12:24,208
- ON IT!

203
00:12:45,834 --> 00:12:48,875
[lava gurgling]

204
00:12:48,917 --> 00:12:50,542
- THROUGH THERE.

205
00:13:02,875 --> 00:13:04,583
- [sighing]

206
00:13:04,625 --> 00:13:05,792
IS IT JUST ME?

207
00:13:05,834 --> 00:13:08,583
OR IS IT, UH, GETTING
REALLY WARM IN HERE?

208
00:13:08,625 --> 00:13:13,750
OH, THIS IS NOT GOOD.

209
00:13:13,792 --> 00:13:17,125
LET'S MOVE IT, PEOPLE!

210
00:13:40,625 --> 00:13:43,417
- [grunts]

211
00:13:55,041 --> 00:13:57,959
- [grunts]

212
00:14:05,375 --> 00:14:08,000
SAY HELLO
TO THE EARTH QUEEN FOR ME.

213
00:14:08,041 --> 00:14:10,625
- [groans]

214
00:14:10,667 --> 00:14:13,417
- DAD!

215
00:14:20,458 --> 00:14:22,125
- WE'RE PINNED DOWN!

216
00:14:22,166 --> 00:14:23,542
- I'M GONNA DRAW HER FIRE.

217
00:14:23,583 --> 00:14:24,667
YOU TAKE HER OUT.

218
00:14:24,709 --> 00:14:28,208
- LIN, NO.

219
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:36,375
- I LOVE YOU.

220
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:39,208
COME AND GET ME,
YOU THIRD-EYED FREAK!

221
00:14:50,875 --> 00:14:54,458
OOH!

222
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:58,667
[groans]

223
00:15:03,792 --> 00:15:06,000
[metal clangs]

224
00:15:06,041 --> 00:15:09,917
- P'LI!

225
00:15:20,083 --> 00:15:23,500
- [grunting]

226
00:15:39,125 --> 00:15:40,375
- IT'S OVER, ZAHEER.

227
00:15:40,417 --> 00:15:42,959
- LET GO YOUR EARTHLY TETHER.

228
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,500
- RELEASE THE AVATAR!

229
00:15:44,542 --> 00:15:45,709
- ENTER THE VOID.

230
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:47,291
- THIS IS YOUR LAST WARNING!

231
00:15:47,333 --> 00:15:50,583
- EMPTY AND BECOME WIND.

232
00:15:53,875 --> 00:15:56,667
- NO! STOP!

233
00:16:05,583 --> 00:16:10,750
- DID HE JUST FLY?

234
00:16:10,792 --> 00:16:13,542
- GUESS HE DOESN'T NEED A RIDE.

235
00:16:13,583 --> 00:16:16,250
- [groaning]

236
00:16:20,041 --> 00:16:22,625
- KORRA.

237
00:16:35,083 --> 00:16:36,959
- WE CAN'T OUTRUN IT!

238
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:41,417
THIS WAY!

239
00:16:49,959 --> 00:16:53,417
- NOW WHAT?

240
00:16:58,709 --> 00:17:00,125
- [grunts]

241
00:17:00,166 --> 00:17:01,834
- BOLIN!

242
00:17:01,875 --> 00:17:05,000
- [screams]

243
00:17:05,041 --> 00:17:09,333
YAH!

244
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:11,000
- INCREDIBLE.

245
00:17:11,041 --> 00:17:12,667
- YOU'RE A LAVABENDER.

246
00:17:12,709 --> 00:17:14,000
- I KNOW.

247
00:17:14,041 --> 00:17:16,291
I JUST FOUND OUT.

248
00:17:16,333 --> 00:17:17,208
[bison growls]

249
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:19,250
- HEY, YOU GUYS NEED A LIFT?

250
00:17:19,291 --> 00:17:21,500
- KAI. YOU'RE ALL RIGHT.

251
00:17:21,542 --> 00:17:22,458
- MORE OR LESS.

252
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:23,500
EVERYONE HOP ON.

253
00:17:31,625 --> 00:17:34,041
[bison groans]

254
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:40,875
[rocks crumble]

255
00:17:48,041 --> 00:17:50,250
- I OWE YOU MY LIFE.

256
00:17:50,291 --> 00:17:51,750
THANK YOU, CAPTAIN.

257
00:17:51,792 --> 00:17:53,792
- YOU CAN CALL ME KUVIRA.

258
00:17:57,542 --> 00:17:59,667
- CAW! CAW!

259
00:17:59,709 --> 00:18:01,667
CAW! CAW!

260
00:18:01,709 --> 00:18:03,792
CAW! CAW!

261
00:18:03,834 --> 00:18:05,083
CAW! CAW!

262
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:08,375
[all screaming]
- [grunts]

263
00:18:08,417 --> 00:18:09,500
- HEY, EVERYBODY.

264
00:18:09,542 --> 00:18:11,291
THERE'S SOMETHING
I GOTTA TELL YOU.

265
00:18:11,333 --> 00:18:13,667
- HOW DID YOU GUYS MAKE IT
OUT OF THAT TEMPLE ALIVE?

266
00:18:13,709 --> 00:18:15,000
- IT WAS ALL BOLIN.

267
00:18:15,041 --> 00:18:16,458
I THOUGHT WE WERE DONE FOR.

268
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:18,834
THEN OUT OF NOWHERE,
HE LAVABENDS.

269
00:18:18,875 --> 00:18:21,125
- I KNEW YOU HAD THE POTENTIAL
FOR SOMETHING BIG.

270
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:22,917
YOU JUST HAD TO BELIEVE
IN YOURSELF.

271
00:18:22,959 --> 00:18:24,750
- YOU'RE RIGHT.

272
00:18:24,792 --> 00:18:27,250
BEING MOMENTS FROM DEATH
WAS A PRETTY GOOD MOTIVATOR TOO.

273
00:18:27,291 --> 00:18:29,583
OF COURSE, WE NEVER WOULD HAVE
MADE IT BACK WITHOUT KAI.

274
00:18:29,625 --> 00:18:31,583
- GLAD I COULD HELP.
SO ANYWAY--

275
00:18:31,625 --> 00:18:33,250
- DID ZAHEER GET AWAY
WITH KORRA?

276
00:18:33,291 --> 00:18:34,625
- I'M AFRAID SO.

277
00:18:34,667 --> 00:18:37,792
- APPARENTLY, HE CAN FLY NOW.
- WHAT?

278
00:18:37,834 --> 00:18:39,875
- HOW?
- ARE YOU SURE?

279
00:18:39,917 --> 00:18:43,083
- I WOULDN'T BELIEVE IT EITHER
IF I HADN'T SEEN IT FOR MYSELF.

280
00:18:43,125 --> 00:18:46,792
- I'VE HEARD THE LEGENDS ABOUT
GURU LAGHIMA'S ABILITY TO FLY.

281
00:18:46,834 --> 00:18:49,083
BUT I NEVER IMAGINED
THEY WERE TRUE.

282
00:18:49,125 --> 00:18:50,375
- SO WHAT'S OUR NEXT MOVE?

283
00:18:50,417 --> 00:18:51,458
- I HAVE AN IDEA.

284
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:53,250
- NOT RIGHT NOW, KID!

285
00:18:53,291 --> 00:18:54,917
WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT WHERE
ZAHEER TOOK KORRA.

286
00:18:54,959 --> 00:18:56,917
- AND FIND THE AIRBENDERS.

287
00:18:56,959 --> 00:18:59,000
- THAT'S WHAT
I'VE BEEN TRYING TO TELL YOU!

288
00:18:59,041 --> 00:19:00,500
I KNOW WHERE THE AIRBENDERS ARE,

289
00:19:00,542 --> 00:19:02,500
AND I BET IT'S WHERE
KORRA IS TOO!

290
00:19:02,542 --> 00:19:04,333
- WELL, WHY DIDN'T YOU
SAY SOMETHING?

291
00:19:04,375 --> 00:19:06,417
- [scoffs]

292
00:19:06,458 --> 00:19:08,583
- WHERE ARE THEY?
HOW DID YOU FIND THEM?

293
00:19:08,625 --> 00:19:10,166
- AFTER I GOT BLASTED
OUT OF THE SKY,

294
00:19:10,208 --> 00:19:11,667
I WOKE UP ON THE SIDE
OF THE MOUNTAIN,

295
00:19:11,709 --> 00:19:12,750
WHERE THIS LITTLE FELLOW
FOUND ME.

296
00:19:12,792 --> 00:19:14,291
[bison whinnies]

297
00:19:14,333 --> 00:19:15,542
I TRIED TO SNEAK BACK
INTO THE TEMPLE

298
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:16,959
TO SEE IF I COULD RESCUE
EVERYONE,

299
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,583
AND THAT'S WHEN
I SAW THE AIRSHIP LEAVING.

300
00:19:18,625 --> 00:19:21,166
I FOLLOWED IT TO SOME CAVES
A FEW MILES FROM HERE.

301
00:19:21,208 --> 00:19:23,208
THAT GIANT LADY MET UP
WITH SOME PEOPLE

302
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:25,208
WHO TOOK THE AIRBENDERS
INTO THE CAVES.

303
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:27,041
- WAS IT GHAZAN AND MING-HUA?

304
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:28,959
- NO, THERE WERE FOUR MORE
OF THEM.

305
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,542
DIDN'T LOOK FAMILIAR.

306
00:19:30,583 --> 00:19:32,542
- MUST BE MORE RED LOTUS MEMBERS
THAN WE THOUGHT.

307
00:19:32,583 --> 00:19:34,166
- I COULDN'T FIGHT THEM ALL
ON MY OWN.

308
00:19:34,208 --> 00:19:36,500
SO I CAME BACK HERE,
HOPING YOU GUYS WOULD SHOW UP.

309
00:19:36,542 --> 00:19:38,417
- WE NEED TO GET TO THOSE CAVES.

310
00:19:38,458 --> 00:19:40,750
- HOW? I DON'T THINK
WE CAN ALL FIT ON MY BISON.

311
00:19:40,792 --> 00:19:45,709
[bison grumbles]

312
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:48,792
- OOGI!

313
00:19:48,834 --> 00:19:53,750
[bison purrs]

314
00:19:53,792 --> 00:19:55,792
I'M GLAD TO SEE YOU TOO,
OLD FRIEND.

315
00:20:01,208 --> 00:20:03,375
- I WANNA COME WITH YOU.

316
00:20:03,417 --> 00:20:05,208
- NO, KUVIRA.

317
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:10,959
STAY WITH THE INJURED.
WE'LL BE BACK FOR YOU
ONCE WE HAVE THE AVATAR.

318
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:16,083
[bison grunts]

319
00:20:16,125 --> 00:20:19,875
- HEY, UM, I APPRECIATE YOU
COMING BACK FOR US.

320
00:20:19,917 --> 00:20:21,542
SORRY FOR EVER GIVING YOU
A HARD TIME.

321
00:20:21,583 --> 00:20:23,208
- THAT'S OKAY.

322
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:24,375
I PROBABLY DESERVED IT.

323
00:20:24,417 --> 00:20:26,291
- YEAH, YOU KINDA DID.

324
00:20:26,333 --> 00:20:31,041
[bison whinnying]

325
00:20:42,583 --> 00:20:45,000
- WHY DIDN'T YOU EVER TELL US
YOU CAN FLY?

326
00:20:45,041 --> 00:20:46,834
- I WASN'T SURE I COULD.

327
00:20:46,875 --> 00:20:51,417
ONLY ONE OTHER AIRBENDER
IN HISTORY HAD THE ABILITY.

328
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:53,417
- HOW'D YOU FIGURE OUT
HOW TO DO IT?

329
00:20:53,458 --> 00:20:55,000
- I FOUND TRUE FREEDOM.

330
00:20:55,041 --> 00:20:58,917
I AM NO LONGER BOUND TO
THIS EARTH BY WORLDLY DESIRES.

331
00:20:58,959 --> 00:21:02,458
I HAVE ENTERED THE VOID.

332
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:05,333
- WHERE'S P'LI?

333
00:21:05,375 --> 00:21:08,166
- SHE SACRIFICED HER LIFE
FOR OUR CAUSE.

334
00:21:08,208 --> 00:21:12,583
NOW LET'S MAKE SURE
IT WASN'T IN VAIN.

335
00:21:27,917 --> 00:21:30,333
- [gasps]

336
00:21:30,375 --> 00:21:32,333
YOU...

337
00:21:32,375 --> 00:21:34,125
YOU KILLED MY FATHER.

338
00:21:34,166 --> 00:21:37,583
[screams]

339
00:21:37,625 --> 00:21:39,375
- I UNDERSTAND YOUR GRIEF.

340
00:21:39,417 --> 00:21:42,709
I ALSO LOST
SOMEONE I LOVED TODAY.

341
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:46,208
BUT YOUR PAIN WILL SOON BE OVER.

342
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:49,250
BRING THE POISON.

343
00:21:49,291 --> 00:21:51,125
- [gasps]
