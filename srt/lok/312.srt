1
00:00:01,461 --> 00:00:03,213
- Tenzin: EARTH.

2
00:00:03,296 --> 00:00:04,881
FIRE.

3
00:00:04,964 --> 00:00:06,424
AIR.

4
00:00:06,508 --> 00:00:07,759
WATER.

5
00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:12,847
ONLY THE AVATAR CAN MASTER
ALL FOUR ELEMENTS

6
00:00:12,931 --> 00:00:15,016
AND BRING BALANCE TO THE WORLD.

7
00:00:20,647 --> 00:00:22,982
- THE NEW AIR NATION IS IN JEOPARDY.

8
00:00:23,066 --> 00:00:25,276
IN AN EFFORT TO FORCE KORRA
TO SURRENDER HERSELF,

9
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:27,278
ZAHEER AMBUSHED
THE NORTHERN AIR TEMPLE.

10
00:00:27,779 --> 00:00:30,490
TENZIN, BUMI AND KYA ATTEMPTED
TO HOLD OFF THE RED LOTUS

11
00:00:30,573 --> 00:00:31,991
BUT WERE INJURED IN BATTLE.

12
00:00:32,075 --> 00:00:34,285
THE AIRBENDERS WERE
UNABLE TO ESCAPE

13
00:00:34,369 --> 00:00:35,745
AND EVERYONE WAS TAKEN CAPTIVE,

14
00:00:35,828 --> 00:00:37,288
EXCEPT KAI.

15
00:00:37,372 --> 00:00:39,207
NOW KORRA AND TEAM AVATAR
RACE TO THE TEMPLE,

16
00:00:39,290 --> 00:00:40,625
HOPING TO MOUNT A RESCUE.

17
00:00:51,052 --> 00:00:52,887
Suyin: I SAY WE MAKE OUR APPROACH
FROM THE WEST.

18
00:00:52,971 --> 00:00:54,806
DROP DOWN FROM THE AIRSHIP
ON CABLES.

19
00:00:54,889 --> 00:00:56,683
AMBUSH THESE RED LOTUS LOWLIFES

20
00:00:56,766 --> 00:00:58,142
BEFORE THEY KNOW WHAT HIT THEM.

21
00:00:58,226 --> 00:00:59,477
- IT'LL NEVER WORK.

22
00:00:59,561 --> 00:01:02,480
THAT COMBUSTION LADY
WILL PICK US OFF ONE BY ONE.

23
00:01:02,564 --> 00:01:05,149
YOU HAVE A BETTER IDEA
HOW TO SAVE THE AIRBENDERS?

24
00:01:05,233 --> 00:01:06,234
- YEAH.

25
00:01:06,317 --> 00:01:07,360
WE COME UP FROM THE VALLEY,

26
00:01:07,443 --> 00:01:09,612
SCALE THE SIDE OF THE MOUNTAIN,
AND TAKE THEM OFF GUARD.

27
00:01:09,696 --> 00:01:10,822
- THAT COULD WORK.

28
00:01:10,905 --> 00:01:13,157
- AND GIVE THEM THE HIGH GROUND? NO.

29
00:01:13,241 --> 00:01:14,367
IF THEIR LAVABENDER SPOTS US,

30
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:15,827
HE'LL MELT THE MOUNTAINSIDE
AND US WITH IT.

31
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:17,245
- WAIT! I GOT IT.

32
00:01:17,328 --> 00:01:19,122
I'LL DISGUISE MYSELF AS A LOST HIKER.

33
00:01:19,205 --> 00:01:21,207
AND ONCE I'M IN THE TEMPLE,
I'LL DISTRACT THE RED LOTUS

34
00:01:21,291 --> 00:01:22,625
WITH MY BIRD CALLS.

35
00:01:24,586 --> 00:01:25,837
CAW! CAW!

36
00:01:27,171 --> 00:01:28,756
CAW! CAW!

37
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:31,009
THAT'S WHEN YOU ALL STRIKE!

38
00:01:31,092 --> 00:01:33,177
- BIRD CALLS? REALLY?

39
00:01:34,679 --> 00:01:37,890
WELL, I HAVEN'T NOTICED YOU
OFFERING ANY SUGGESTIONS.

40
00:01:37,974 --> 00:01:39,017
- Korra: IT DOESN'T MATTER.

41
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:40,643
NONE OF THESE IDEAS WILL WORK.

42
00:01:40,727 --> 00:01:43,104
THE SECOND ZAHEER REALIZES
WE'RE UP TO SOMETHING,

43
00:01:43,187 --> 00:01:44,606
HE'LL WIPE OUT THE AIRBENDERS.

44
00:01:44,689 --> 00:01:47,150
- AND OPAL IS ONE OF THOSE AIRBENDERS.

45
00:01:47,233 --> 00:01:49,611
BELIEVE ME, I UNDERSTAND
WHAT'S AT STAKE.

46
00:01:49,694 --> 00:01:51,362
- THEN I THINK YOU'LL AGREE.

47
00:01:51,446 --> 00:01:54,741
THE ONLY PLAN THAT WILL WORK
IS FOR ME TO GIVE MYSELF UP.

48
00:01:54,824 --> 00:01:56,117
- WHAT?
- KORRA, NO.

49
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,952
- WE'LL FIGURE OUT ANOTHER WAY.

50
00:01:58,036 --> 00:01:59,621
- I TALKED IT OVER WITH LORD ZUKO,

51
00:01:59,704 --> 00:02:01,581
AND I'VE GIVEN IT A LOT OF THOUGHT.

52
00:02:02,081 --> 00:02:03,458
I HAVE TO DO THIS.

53
00:02:03,541 --> 00:02:06,461
YOU CAN'T EXPECT US TO SIT BY
AND JUST LET ZAHEER TAKE YOU.

54
00:02:06,544 --> 00:02:08,755
THE WORLD HAS BEEN OUT OF BALANCE
FOR FAR TOO LONG.

55
00:02:08,838 --> 00:02:11,090
IT NEEDS THE AIR NATION BACK AGAIN.

56
00:02:11,174 --> 00:02:15,136
I CAN'T LET ZAHEER DESTROY IT
AND EVERYONE WE LOVE.

57
00:02:15,219 --> 00:02:16,929
HELP ME SAVE THE AIRBENDERS.

58
00:02:17,013 --> 00:02:19,015
THEN YOU CAN WORRY ABOUT SAVING ME.

59
00:02:21,309 --> 00:02:22,477
- WE'RE WITH YOU, KORRA.

60
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,145
- YES, WHATEVER YOU NEED.

61
00:02:24,228 --> 00:02:25,647
WE'RE HERE.

62
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:27,273
- I'LL GO RADIO ZAHEER.

63
00:02:40,787 --> 00:02:42,622
Korra: ZAHEER, ARE YOU THERE?

64
00:02:42,705 --> 00:02:43,915
IT'S ME.

65
00:02:45,083 --> 00:02:46,501
- I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR YOUR CALL.

66
00:02:46,584 --> 00:02:48,753
SO DO WE HAVE A DEAL?

67
00:02:48,836 --> 00:02:49,837
- YES.

68
00:02:49,921 --> 00:02:52,507
YOU RELEASE THE AIRBENDERS,
AND THEN I'LL TURN MYSELF OVER.

69
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:55,009
AND TAKE AWAY
THE ONLY LEVERAGE I HAVE?

70
00:02:55,093 --> 00:02:56,052
NO.

71
00:02:56,135 --> 00:02:57,136
I CAN'T DO THAT.

72
00:02:57,220 --> 00:02:58,596
LISTEN CAREFULLY.

73
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,640
HERE'S WHAT I WANT YOU TO DO.

74
00:03:03,559 --> 00:03:05,269
- WILL YOU SIT DOWN?

75
00:03:05,353 --> 00:03:07,397
I'M ALREADY TENSE ENOUGH AS IT IS!

76
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:08,773
- I'M JUST WORRIED ABOUT OPAL.

77
00:03:08,856 --> 00:03:11,192
AND PABU'S NOT HERE TO COMFORT ME.

78
00:03:11,275 --> 00:03:13,861
I HOPE HE AND NAGA
ARE DOING OKAY BACK IN ZAOFU.

79
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,121
- NO.

80
00:03:23,204 --> 00:03:24,664
NOT MAKO'S SCARF!

81
00:03:24,747 --> 00:03:27,250
BAD DOG AND RAT-THINGY!

82
00:03:27,333 --> 00:03:29,252
I'M VERY DISAPPOINTED IN YOU TWO.

83
00:03:42,223 --> 00:03:44,434
- DID YOU SPEAK TO ZAHEER?
- YES.

84
00:03:44,517 --> 00:03:48,938
HE TOLD ME TO COME TO THE TOP OF
LAGHIMA'S PEAK AT NOON. ALONE.

85
00:03:49,313 --> 00:03:53,818
ONCE HE HAS ME, HE'LL RELEASE THE
AIRBENDERS OVER TO YOU AT THE TEMPLE.

86
00:03:53,901 --> 00:03:55,820
I THINK I FIGURED OUT
A WAY TO PLAY THIS

87
00:03:55,903 --> 00:03:59,031
SO THE AIRBENDERS AND KORRA
ALL COME OUT IN ONE PIECE.

88
00:03:59,115 --> 00:04:00,116
- HOW?

89
00:04:00,199 --> 00:04:01,951
ZAHEER DOESN'T KNOW
HOW MANY OF US THERE ARE.

90
00:04:02,034 --> 00:04:04,120
SO WE HAVE THE NUMBERS ADVANTAGE.

91
00:04:04,203 --> 00:04:05,788
I SAY WE SPLIT INTO TWO TEAMS.

92
00:04:05,872 --> 00:04:09,000
MAKO, BOLIN AND ASAMI
WILL TAKE THE AIRSHIP UP TO THE TEMPLE.

93
00:04:09,083 --> 00:04:12,086
MEANWHILE, MY METALBENDERS,
TONRAQ, LIN, AND I WILL GET

94
00:04:12,170 --> 00:04:14,505
INTO POSITION BELOW LAGHIMA'S PEAK.

95
00:04:18,676 --> 00:04:21,095
- LET GO YOUR EARTHLY TETHER.

96
00:04:21,179 --> 00:04:22,597
ENTER THE VOID.

97
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:27,477
EMPTY AND BECOME WIND.

98
00:04:31,689 --> 00:04:33,483
- THE AIRBENDERS ARE SECURE.

99
00:04:33,983 --> 00:04:35,193
- THANK YOU, P'LI.

100
00:04:35,276 --> 00:04:36,569
FOR EVERYTHING.

101
00:04:36,652 --> 00:04:38,196
- OF COURSE.

102
00:04:38,613 --> 00:04:40,323
- I WANT YOU TO KNOW,

103
00:04:40,406 --> 00:04:41,949
NOT ONE DAY WENT BY IN THAT PRISON

104
00:04:42,033 --> 00:04:43,618
WHEN I DIDN'T THINK OF YOU.

105
00:04:45,453 --> 00:04:48,706
THE YEARS APART ONLY MADE
MY LOVE FOR YOU STRONGER.

106
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:51,834
AND, DEEP DOWN, I KNEW
YOU'D FIND A WAY TO GET ME OUT.

107
00:04:51,918 --> 00:04:53,628
JUST LIKE YOU SAVED ME FROM BECOMING

108
00:04:53,711 --> 00:04:56,798
THAT WARLORD'S KILLING MACHINE
WHEN I WAS A GIRL.

109
00:04:56,881 --> 00:04:58,925
YOU'VE SHOWN ME
WHAT TRUE FREEDOM MEANS.

110
00:05:00,593 --> 00:05:01,719
- AND, AFTER TODAY,

111
00:05:02,178 --> 00:05:05,515
WE'LL SHOW THE ENTIRE WORLD
WHAT IT MEANS.

112
00:05:05,598 --> 00:05:06,849
NO MORE PRISONS.

113
00:05:06,933 --> 00:05:08,684
NO MORE RUNNING.

114
00:05:08,768 --> 00:05:10,228
- I LOVE YOU, ZAHEER.

115
00:05:10,311 --> 00:05:11,395
- I LOVE YOU TOO.

116
00:05:29,956 --> 00:05:31,874
RADIO THE SECOND
YOU SEE THOSE AIRBENDERS.

117
00:05:31,958 --> 00:05:33,125
- I WILL, CHIEF.

118
00:05:33,209 --> 00:05:34,502
GOOD LUCK.

119
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:42,802
- BE CAREFUL, KORRA.

120
00:05:42,885 --> 00:05:44,095
- YOU TOO.

121
00:06:05,283 --> 00:06:07,243
- KORRA.
- DON'T WORRY, DAD.

122
00:06:07,326 --> 00:06:08,619
I'LL BE ALL RIGHT.

123
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:12,874
I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW
HOW PROUD I AM OF YOU.

124
00:06:12,957 --> 00:06:15,042
THE RISK YOU'RE TAKING
TO SAVE THE AIR NATION

125
00:06:15,126 --> 00:06:17,128
WILL BE REMEMBERED FOR GENERATIONS.

126
00:06:17,211 --> 00:06:18,588
- I LOVE YOU, DAD.

127
00:06:18,671 --> 00:06:20,047
- I LOVE YOU TOO, SWEETHEART.

128
00:06:25,887 --> 00:06:27,138
- AND, DAD.

129
00:06:27,221 --> 00:06:28,848
WATCH OUT FOR ZAHEER.

130
00:06:28,931 --> 00:06:30,892
HE'S NOT VERY FOND OF WORLD LEADERS.

131
00:06:30,975 --> 00:06:32,184
- I CAN HANDLE HIM.

132
00:06:32,268 --> 00:06:34,520
JUST STAY FOCUSED ON YOUR MISSION.

133
00:06:59,879 --> 00:07:02,298
- OH, MAN.

134
00:07:02,381 --> 00:07:04,467
MUST HAVE BEEN SOME FIGHT.

135
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:06,177
Korra: MAKO, DO YOU SEE
THE AIRBENDERS?

136
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:07,261
- NOT YET.

137
00:07:07,345 --> 00:07:08,387
WE'RE JUST ARRIVING.

138
00:07:08,471 --> 00:07:11,015
DON'T TURN YOURSELF OVER
UNTIL I GET A VISUAL ON THEM.

139
00:07:25,196 --> 00:07:26,197
- THIS WAY.

140
00:07:29,951 --> 00:07:32,244
YOU WANT THE AIRBENDERS OR NOT?

141
00:07:44,882 --> 00:07:47,468
DROP YOUR STAFF
AND SURRENDER YOURSELF.

142
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:52,890
DON'T MAKE ME COME GET YOU.

143
00:08:01,732 --> 00:08:04,235
Korra: MAKO. WHAT'S GOING ON?

144
00:08:04,318 --> 00:08:06,112
- THEY'RE HERE.

145
00:08:06,195 --> 00:08:07,738
BUT SO IS THE LAVABENDER.

146
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:11,367
TELL GHAZAN
TO LET THE AIRBENDERS GO.

147
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:13,327
- NOT UNTIL YOU TURN YOURSELF OVER.

148
00:08:13,411 --> 00:08:15,246
THIS ISN'T A NEGOTIATION.

149
00:08:20,626 --> 00:08:21,752
WIPE THEM OUT.

150
00:08:21,836 --> 00:08:23,671
- NO! WAIT!

151
00:08:23,754 --> 00:08:25,172
I'M COMING.

152
00:08:29,093 --> 00:08:30,511
- STAND DOWN.

153
00:08:46,027 --> 00:08:48,029
AND DON'T BOTHER TRYING
TO METALBEND OUT OF THESE.

154
00:08:48,112 --> 00:08:49,530
THEY'RE PLATINUM.

155
00:08:56,662 --> 00:08:57,872
- WE HAVE HER.

156
00:09:07,131 --> 00:09:08,591
- IT'S OKAY, TENZIN.

157
00:09:08,674 --> 00:09:10,134
WE'RE ABOUT TO GET YOU OUT OF HERE.

158
00:09:24,565 --> 00:09:25,941
- KORRA, IT WAS A TRICK!

159
00:09:26,025 --> 00:09:27,026
THEY'RE NOT HERE!

160
00:09:27,109 --> 00:09:28,861
DON'T TURN YOURSELF OVER!

161
00:09:28,944 --> 00:09:30,780
- WE HAD A DEAL!

162
00:09:33,866 --> 00:09:35,534
- CHIEF, GET KORRA OUT OF THERE NOW!

163
00:09:35,618 --> 00:09:36,786
- GO! GO!

164
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:09,068
GET THE AVATAR
ON THE AIRSHIP.

165
00:10:09,151 --> 00:10:10,361
I'LL DEAL WITH THEM.

166
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:03,080
- NOWHERE TO GO, ZAHEER!

167
00:11:17,553 --> 00:11:18,888
- WHERE ARE THE AIRBENDERS?

168
00:11:18,971 --> 00:11:20,347
- I DON'T KNOW.

169
00:11:20,431 --> 00:11:22,850
ZAHEER MOVED THEM OUT OF THE TEMPLE.

170
00:11:25,227 --> 00:11:27,438
- WILL YOU JUST BURY THEM ALREADY?

171
00:11:43,329 --> 00:11:44,330
- COME ON.

172
00:11:47,791 --> 00:11:49,543
WE HAVE TO GET BACK TO THE AIRSHIP!

173
00:11:49,627 --> 00:11:52,004
NOT GONNA HAPPEN!
THE EXIT'S BLOCKED!

174
00:12:05,643 --> 00:12:08,312
- WHERE'S OOGI?
- GONE.

175
00:12:08,646 --> 00:12:11,607
ALL THE BISON GOT SCARED OFF
DURING THE ATTACK.

176
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:14,235
BUT I THINK I KNOW ANOTHER WAY OUT.

177
00:12:14,318 --> 00:12:17,238
BOLIN, CAN YOU GET US
THROUGH THAT WALL?

178
00:12:17,321 --> 00:12:18,530
- ON IT!

179
00:12:43,639 --> 00:12:45,099
- THROUGH THERE.

180
00:12:58,654 --> 00:12:59,947
IS IT JUST ME?

181
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:02,616
OR IS IT, UH, GETTING
REALLY WARM IN HERE?

182
00:13:03,742 --> 00:13:05,536
OH, THIS IS NOT GOOD.

183
00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:10,916
LET'S MOVE IT, PEOPLE!

184
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:01,550
SAY HELLO TO THE EARTH QUEEN FOR ME.

185
00:14:05,179 --> 00:14:06,388
- DAD!

186
00:14:14,772 --> 00:14:16,357
- WE'RE PINNED DOWN!

187
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:17,691
- I'M GONNA DRAW HER FIRE.

188
00:14:17,775 --> 00:14:18,776
YOU TAKE HER OUT.

189
00:14:18,859 --> 00:14:20,235
- LIN, NO.

190
00:14:27,785 --> 00:14:29,078
- I LOVE YOU.

191
00:14:30,412 --> 00:14:32,623
COME AND GET ME,
YOU THIRD-EYED FREAK!

192
00:14:45,219 --> 00:14:46,804
OOH!

193
00:14:59,858 --> 00:15:01,276
- P'LI!

194
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:34,476
- IT'S OVER, ZAHEER.

195
00:15:35,144 --> 00:15:37,104
- LET GO YOUR EARTHLY TETHER.

196
00:15:37,187 --> 00:15:38,605
- RELEASE THE AVATAR!

197
00:15:38,689 --> 00:15:39,773
- ENTER THE VOID.

198
00:15:39,857 --> 00:15:41,442
- THIS IS YOUR LAST WARNING!

199
00:15:41,525 --> 00:15:43,527
- EMPTY AND BECOME WIND.

200
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:48,532
- NO! STOP!

201
00:15:59,585 --> 00:16:01,712
- DID HE JUST FLY?

202
00:16:04,882 --> 00:16:06,842
- GUESS HE DOESN'T NEED A RIDE.

203
00:16:14,266 --> 00:16:15,559
- KORRA.

204
00:16:29,198 --> 00:16:30,491
- WE CAN'T OUTRUN IT!

205
00:16:31,283 --> 00:16:32,409
THIS WAY!

206
00:16:44,254 --> 00:16:45,464
- NOW WHAT?

207
00:16:54,097 --> 00:16:55,516
- BOLIN!

208
00:16:58,936 --> 00:17:00,729
YAH!

209
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,650
- INCREDIBLE.

210
00:17:04,733 --> 00:17:06,443
- YOU'RE A LAVABENDER.

211
00:17:07,027 --> 00:17:08,570
- I KNOW.

212
00:17:08,654 --> 00:17:10,113
I JUST FOUND OUT.

213
00:17:11,615 --> 00:17:13,534
- HEY, YOU GUYS NEED A LIFT?

214
00:17:13,617 --> 00:17:14,701
- KAI.

215
00:17:14,785 --> 00:17:15,827
YOU'RE ALL RIGHT.

216
00:17:15,911 --> 00:17:16,995
- MORE OR LESS.

217
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:18,205
EVERYONE HOP ON.

218
00:17:43,146 --> 00:17:44,606
- I OWE YOU MY LIFE.

219
00:17:45,107 --> 00:17:46,316
THANK YOU, CAPTAIN.

220
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,819
- YOU CAN CALL ME KUVIRA.

221
00:17:51,863 --> 00:17:53,907
- Bolin: CAW! CAW!

222
00:17:53,991 --> 00:17:59,246
CAW! CAW!

223
00:18:02,791 --> 00:18:04,001
- HEY, EVERYBODY.

224
00:18:04,084 --> 00:18:05,711
THERE'S SOMETHING I GOTTA TELL YOU.

225
00:18:05,794 --> 00:18:07,879
HOW DID YOU GUYS
MAKE IT OUT OF THAT TEMPLE ALIVE?

226
00:18:07,963 --> 00:18:09,339
- IT WAS ALL BOLIN.

227
00:18:09,423 --> 00:18:10,632
I THOUGHT WE WERE DONE FOR.

228
00:18:10,716 --> 00:18:13,468
THEN OUT OF NOWHERE, HE LAVABENDS.

229
00:18:13,552 --> 00:18:15,762
I KNEW YOU HAD THE POTENTIAL
FOR SOMETHING BIG.

230
00:18:15,846 --> 00:18:17,806
YOU JUST HAD TO BELIEVE IN YOURSELF.

231
00:18:17,889 --> 00:18:19,266
- YOU'RE RIGHT.

232
00:18:19,349 --> 00:18:21,768
BEING MOMENTS FROM DEATH
WAS A PRETTY GOOD MOTIVATOR TOO.

233
00:18:21,852 --> 00:18:23,770
OF COURSE, WE NEVER WOULD HAVE
MADE IT BACK WITHOUT KAI.

234
00:18:23,854 --> 00:18:25,772
- GLAD I COULD HELP. SO ANYWAY...

235
00:18:25,856 --> 00:18:27,608
- DID ZAHEER GET AWAY WITH KORRA?

236
00:18:27,691 --> 00:18:28,859
- I'M AFRAID SO.

237
00:18:28,942 --> 00:18:31,987
- APPARENTLY, HE CAN FLY NOW.
- WHAT?

238
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:33,989
- HOW?
- ARE YOU SURE?

239
00:18:34,072 --> 00:18:36,950
I WOULDN'T BELIEVE IT
EITHER IF I HADN'T SEEN IT FOR MYSELF.

240
00:18:37,034 --> 00:18:41,038
I'VE HEARD THE LEGENDS ABOUT
GURU LAGHIMA'S ABILITY TO FLY.

241
00:18:41,121 --> 00:18:43,248
BUT I NEVER IMAGINED THEY WERE TRUE.

242
00:18:43,332 --> 00:18:44,708
- SO WHAT'S OUR NEXT MOVE?

243
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:45,792
- I HAVE AN IDEA.

244
00:18:45,876 --> 00:18:47,127
- NOT RIGHT NOW, KID!

245
00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:49,504
WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT WHERE
ZAHEER TOOK KORRA.

246
00:18:49,588 --> 00:18:51,131
- Tonraq: AND FIND THE AIRBENDERS.

247
00:18:51,214 --> 00:18:53,133
THAT'S WHAT
I'VE BEEN TRYING TO TELL YOU!

248
00:18:53,216 --> 00:18:54,426
I KNOW WHERE THE AIRBENDERS ARE,

249
00:18:54,509 --> 00:18:56,386
AND I BET IT'S WHERE KORRA IS TOO!

250
00:18:56,762 --> 00:18:58,555
- WELL, WHY DIDN'T YOU SAY SOMETHING?

251
00:19:00,474 --> 00:19:02,768
WHERE ARE THEY?
HOW DID YOU FIND THEM?

252
00:19:02,851 --> 00:19:04,394
- AFTER I GOT BLASTED OUT OF THE SKY,

253
00:19:04,478 --> 00:19:05,812
I WOKE UP ON THE SIDE OF THE MOUNTAIN,

254
00:19:05,896 --> 00:19:07,147
WHERE THIS LITTLE FELLOW FOUND ME.

255
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:09,566
I TRIED TO SNEAK BACK INTO THE TEMPLE

256
00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:10,817
TO SEE IF I COULD RESCUE EVERYONE,

257
00:19:10,901 --> 00:19:13,028
AND THAT'S WHEN
I SAW THE AIRSHIP LEAVING.

258
00:19:13,111 --> 00:19:15,656
I FOLLOWED IT TO SOME CAVES
A FEW MILES FROM HERE.

259
00:19:15,739 --> 00:19:17,240
THAT GIANT LADY
MET UP WITH SOME PEOPLE

260
00:19:17,324 --> 00:19:19,242
WHO TOOK THE AIRBENDERS
INTO THE CAVES.

261
00:19:19,326 --> 00:19:21,078
- WAS IT GHAZAN AND MING-HUA?

262
00:19:21,161 --> 00:19:22,996
- NO, THERE WERE FOUR MORE OF THEM.

263
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:24,331
DIDN'T LOOK FAMILIAR.

264
00:19:24,414 --> 00:19:26,583
MUST BE MORE RED LOTUS
MEMBERS THAN WE THOUGHT.

265
00:19:26,667 --> 00:19:28,168
- I COULDN'T FIGHT THEM ALL ON MY OWN.

266
00:19:28,251 --> 00:19:30,671
SO I CAME BACK HERE,
HOPING YOU GUYS WOULD SHOW UP.

267
00:19:30,754 --> 00:19:32,339
- WE NEED TO GET TO THOSE CAVES.

268
00:19:32,422 --> 00:19:34,841
HOW? I DON'T THINK
WE CAN ALL FIT ON MY BISON.

269
00:19:40,097 --> 00:19:41,473
- OOGI!

270
00:19:47,938 --> 00:19:50,357
I'M GLAD TO SEE YOU TOO, OLD FRIEND.

271
00:19:56,154 --> 00:19:57,572
- I WANNA COME WITH YOU.

272
00:19:57,656 --> 00:19:59,908
- NO, KUVIRA. STAY WITH THE INJURED.

273
00:19:59,991 --> 00:20:01,785
WE'LL BE BACK FOR YOU
ONCE WE HAVE THE AVATAR.

274
00:20:10,711 --> 00:20:14,464
HEY, UM, I APPRECIATE YOU
COMING BACK FOR US.

275
00:20:14,548 --> 00:20:16,425
SORRY FOR EVER GIVING YOU A HARD TIME.

276
00:20:16,508 --> 00:20:17,926
- THAT'S OKAY.

277
00:20:18,009 --> 00:20:19,052
I PROBABLY DESERVED IT.

278
00:20:19,136 --> 00:20:21,138
- YEAH, YOU KINDA DID.

279
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:39,781
WHY DIDN'T YOU EVER TELL US
YOU CAN FLY?

280
00:20:39,865 --> 00:20:41,408
- I WASN'T SURE I COULD.

281
00:20:41,783 --> 00:20:44,953
ONLY ONE OTHER AIRBENDER
IN HISTORY HAD THE ABILITY.

282
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:48,081
- HOW'D YOU FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO IT?

283
00:20:48,165 --> 00:20:49,708
- I FOUND TRUE FREEDOM.

284
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:53,336
I AM NO LONGER BOUND TO THIS EARTH
BY WORLDLY DESIRES.

285
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:55,338
I HAVE ENTERED THE VOID.

286
00:20:57,299 --> 00:20:58,675
- WHERE'S P'LI?

287
00:20:59,968 --> 00:21:03,013
SHE SACRIFICED HER LIFE
FOR OUR CAUSE.

288
00:21:03,096 --> 00:21:05,766
NOW LET'S MAKE SURE IT WASN'T IN VAIN.

289
00:21:25,243 --> 00:21:27,162
YOU...

290
00:21:27,245 --> 00:21:29,247
YOU KILLED MY FATHER.

291
00:21:32,542 --> 00:21:34,377
- I UNDERSTAND YOUR GRIEF.

292
00:21:34,461 --> 00:21:37,589
I ALSO LOST SOMEONE I LOVED TODAY.

293
00:21:37,672 --> 00:21:39,800
BUT YOUR PAIN WILL SOON BE OVER.

294
00:21:40,550 --> 00:21:42,302
BRING THE POISON.
