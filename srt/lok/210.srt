1
00:00:07,547 --> 00:00:09,548
Earth.

2
00:00:09,549 --> 00:00:11,049
Fire.

3
00:00:11,050 --> 00:00:13,051
Air.

4
00:00:13,052 --> 00:00:15,153
Water.

5
00:00:15,154 --> 00:00:18,957
Only the Avatar can master
all four elements

6
00:00:18,958 --> 00:00:21,259
and bring balance to the world.

7
00:00:27,266 --> 00:00:29,968
Korra and Jinora
have entered the spirit world.

8
00:00:29,969 --> 00:00:32,137
With Tenzin's daughter
as her spiritual guide,

9
00:00:32,138 --> 00:00:33,572
the Avatar has one mission:

10
00:00:33,573 --> 00:00:36,675
to close the spirit portal
before harmonic convergence.

11
00:00:36,676 --> 00:00:38,376
Meanwhile,
Unalaq has been working

12
00:00:38,377 --> 00:00:40,412
with the dark spirit Vaatu,
who was imprisoned

13
00:00:40,413 --> 00:00:42,814
by Avatar Wan 10,000 years ago.

14
00:00:42,815 --> 00:00:44,649
Will Korra be able to close the portal

15
00:00:44,650 --> 00:00:49,650
and stop Unalaq from enacting
his deadly plan?

16
00:00:57,096 --> 00:00:59,064
- I can't believe my little girl

17
00:00:59,065 --> 00:01:00,966
had to guide Korra into the spirit world

18
00:01:00,967 --> 00:01:02,334
instead of me.

19
00:01:02,335 --> 00:01:03,602
If anything happens to her,

20
00:01:03,603 --> 00:01:05,303
I won't be able to forgive myself.

21
00:01:05,304 --> 00:01:06,671
- She's very smart,

22
00:01:06,672 --> 00:01:08,640
and she obviously has
a strong connection

23
00:01:08,641 --> 00:01:09,674
to the spirits.

24
00:01:09,675 --> 00:01:11,243
She'll be fine.

25
00:01:11,244 --> 00:01:13,979
- Yeah, Dad went all the time.

26
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:15,781
- They won't have
their bending in there.

27
00:01:15,782 --> 00:01:16,815
They'll be defenseless.

28
00:01:18,084 --> 00:01:20,118
Excuse me,

29
00:01:20,119 --> 00:01:22,354
but I've never had bending,

30
00:01:22,355 --> 00:01:24,856
and I don't think
I'd call myself "defenseless."

31
00:01:24,857 --> 00:01:26,091
- Of course you aren't,

32
00:01:26,092 --> 00:01:29,861
because you have your, um...

33
00:01:29,862 --> 00:01:31,396
- Positive attitude?

34
00:01:31,397 --> 00:01:32,931
- I would have said acute intellect

35
00:01:32,932 --> 00:01:35,100
and catlike reflexes, but whatever.

36
00:01:35,101 --> 00:01:36,768
- Why don't you two get some sleep?

37
00:01:36,769 --> 00:01:38,537
I'll take the first watch.

38
00:01:38,538 --> 00:01:40,372
- Wake us up if you need some company.

39
00:01:40,373 --> 00:01:43,642
- Or if any interesting
spirity stuff happens,

40
00:01:43,643 --> 00:01:45,911
like their bodies start floating around

41
00:01:45,912 --> 00:01:47,579
and you need someone
to help you grab them

42
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:48,613
before they fly off.

43
00:01:48,614 --> 00:01:50,015
- Bumi.

44
00:01:50,016 --> 00:01:54,786
- I'm just saying
we're here if you need us.

45
00:01:54,787 --> 00:01:59,787
- I know you are.
Thank you.

46
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:06,160
Please come back soon.

47
00:02:06,732 --> 00:02:08,934
- Isn't it beautiful?

48
00:02:08,935 --> 00:02:11,303
- Just stick close to me, okay?

49
00:02:11,304 --> 00:02:13,505
This seems nice, but you never know

50
00:02:13,506 --> 00:02:15,240
when we'll run into some dark spirits.

51
00:02:15,241 --> 00:02:16,274
Huh.

52
00:02:16,275 --> 00:02:17,876
- Look.

53
00:02:17,877 --> 00:02:19,878
It's like it's made of jewels.

54
00:02:19,879 --> 00:02:21,713
The spirits are so much more beautiful

55
00:02:21,714 --> 00:02:23,715
in their own world
than they are at home.

56
00:02:23,716 --> 00:02:25,383
- Jinora, be careful.

57
00:02:25,384 --> 00:02:27,385
Hold on.

58
00:02:27,386 --> 00:02:28,720
- Hey.

59
00:02:28,721 --> 00:02:31,089
Watch where you're goin',
you giant clod.

60
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:33,458
- Sorry.
- This is a residential area,

61
00:02:33,459 --> 00:02:34,993
in case you hadn't noticed.

62
00:02:34,994 --> 00:02:37,629
Who do you think you are,
stomping through here like that?

63
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:39,731
- I'm the Avatar.

64
00:02:39,732 --> 00:02:40,866
- The Avatar.

65
00:02:40,867 --> 00:02:43,068
Not impressed.

66
00:02:43,069 --> 00:02:45,070
- I'm trying to find the spirit portals?

67
00:02:45,071 --> 00:02:47,806
I opened one--
- I heard Unalaq did that.

68
00:02:47,807 --> 00:02:49,507
- No, I did, but--

69
00:02:49,508 --> 00:02:51,743
- Well, if you opened it, how come
you don't know where it is, huh?

70
00:02:52,812 --> 00:02:54,980
B-b-because I was
at the South Pole.

71
00:02:54,981 --> 00:02:57,249
- I don't trust her.
- Get out of our world.

72
00:02:57,250 --> 00:03:00,752
- We don't need you.
- You don't belong here.

73
00:03:00,753 --> 00:03:02,120
- Get away from me.

74
00:03:04,056 --> 00:03:05,423
- Did you guys see that?

75
00:03:05,424 --> 00:03:07,092
She tried to bend at us

76
00:03:07,093 --> 00:03:08,293
in our own holes.

77
00:03:08,294 --> 00:03:10,595
Get her!

78
00:03:12,164 --> 00:03:15,400
Jinora!

79
00:03:15,401 --> 00:03:17,269
- Korra! Stay calm.

80
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:19,938
Your energy is upsetting them.

81
00:03:19,939 --> 00:03:22,707
You're only making it worse.

82
00:03:55,508 --> 00:04:00,508
- Jinora!

83
00:04:13,659 --> 00:04:16,061
Jinora?

84
00:04:16,062 --> 00:04:21,062
Jinora.

85
00:04:29,575 --> 00:04:30,608
Ah.

86
00:04:39,452 --> 00:04:43,455
Jinora.

87
00:04:43,456 --> 00:04:45,757
Jinora.

88
00:04:58,904 --> 00:05:02,340
- Korra!
Where are you?

89
00:05:02,341 --> 00:05:03,975
Hello?
I'm lost.

90
00:05:03,976 --> 00:05:06,644
Can anyone help me?

91
00:05:11,384 --> 00:05:13,952
Furry-Foot, is that you?

92
00:05:15,221 --> 00:05:20,221
It's so good
to see you again.

93
00:05:20,393 --> 00:05:24,295
You're so big here.

94
00:05:24,296 --> 00:05:27,232
I don't suppose you know
where Korra is, do you?

95
00:05:27,233 --> 00:05:29,501
We were supposed to go find
the spirit portals,

96
00:05:29,502 --> 00:05:33,171
but I don't know how to find
anything down here.

97
00:05:59,265 --> 00:06:02,100
It's like an awesome tree house.

98
00:06:02,101 --> 00:06:04,602
Wait, I've read about this place.

99
00:06:04,603 --> 00:06:06,471
Grandpa Aang came here.

100
00:06:06,472 --> 00:06:11,472
It's Wan Shi Tang's spirit library.

101
00:06:19,251 --> 00:06:24,251
- Ah!

102
00:06:35,634 --> 00:06:37,168
I'm sorry I swatted you.

103
00:06:37,169 --> 00:06:42,169
You just scared me.

104
00:06:43,042 --> 00:06:45,210
- You two look lost.

105
00:06:45,211 --> 00:06:47,946
Maybe I can help you.

106
00:06:47,947 --> 00:06:49,380
- I know you.

107
00:06:49,381 --> 00:06:53,184
- I was good friends with Avatar Aang.

108
00:06:53,185 --> 00:06:54,519
- lroh.

109
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:59,520
- Hello, Korra.

110
00:07:00,659 --> 00:07:02,594
- I'm glad you came to visit us

111
00:07:02,595 --> 00:07:04,429
in the spirit world, Korra.

112
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:09,430
You came just in time.

113
00:07:10,636 --> 00:07:12,837
We're having a little tea party

114
00:07:12,838 --> 00:07:15,740
to celebrate May-Jim's wedding.

115
00:07:15,741 --> 00:07:18,610
- How can you marry each other?

116
00:07:18,611 --> 00:07:19,644
Aren't you...

117
00:07:19,645 --> 00:07:22,213
- Complete opposites?
I know.

118
00:07:22,214 --> 00:07:24,415
- I tried to fight it,

119
00:07:24,416 --> 00:07:26,484
but she really grew on me.

120
00:07:26,485 --> 00:07:29,354
- The spirit world is very mysterious,

121
00:07:29,355 --> 00:07:31,022
but so is love.

122
00:07:31,023 --> 00:07:33,691
Help yourself
to some tea and cakes.

123
00:07:33,692 --> 00:07:35,160
They are spirit cakes,

124
00:07:35,161 --> 00:07:37,228
so you won't gain
any weight.

125
00:07:37,229 --> 00:07:40,732
Of course,
you won't lose any, either.

126
00:07:40,733 --> 00:07:44,235
- This part of the spirit world
isn't so scary.

127
00:07:44,236 --> 00:07:46,638
My teapot.

128
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:50,542
- That's right.
It was yours long, long ago.

129
00:07:50,543 --> 00:07:52,377
When you were Avatar Wan,

130
00:07:52,378 --> 00:07:56,247
you used it to carry
the light spirit Raava around

131
00:07:56,248 --> 00:07:59,284
until the two of you became one.

132
00:07:59,285 --> 00:08:02,187
It's my favorite thing I've found here.

133
00:08:02,188 --> 00:08:04,923
You know,
when you make tea in it,

134
00:08:04,924 --> 00:08:06,724
you can still taste

135
00:08:06,725 --> 00:08:11,725
a little light in every cup.

136
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:36,287
- Wow.

137
00:08:36,288 --> 00:08:41,288
I could just stay in here
forever, reading.

138
00:08:44,563 --> 00:08:49,563
- The last human who said that
is still here.

139
00:08:50,436 --> 00:08:51,970
- Professor Zei.

140
00:08:51,971 --> 00:08:54,305
- I see that you have
some knowledge of the past,

141
00:08:54,306 --> 00:08:55,873
so you should know that humans

142
00:08:55,874 --> 00:08:58,843
are no longer allowed in my library.

143
00:08:58,844 --> 00:09:01,112
Get out.

144
00:09:01,113 --> 00:09:02,380
- I thought anyone could come in

145
00:09:02,381 --> 00:09:03,948
if they brought you some new knowledge.

146
00:09:03,949 --> 00:09:06,184
- Those are the old rules.

147
00:09:06,185 --> 00:09:08,119
Besides, what is a little girl

148
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:10,121
going to teach Wan Shi Tong,

149
00:09:10,122 --> 00:09:13,191
He Who Knows 10,000 Things?

150
00:09:13,192 --> 00:09:15,360
- Well, since you've been down
in the spirit world,

151
00:09:15,361 --> 00:09:17,695
the humans have invented radio.

152
00:09:17,696 --> 00:09:20,198
- Yes, I am well aware of the radio.

153
00:09:20,199 --> 00:09:22,467
- But do you know how it works?

154
00:09:22,468 --> 00:09:24,269
- Of course I do.

155
00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:26,337
There is a box,
and inside the box,

156
00:09:26,338 --> 00:09:28,006
there is a tiny man who sings

157
00:09:28,007 --> 00:09:30,108
and plays musical instruments.

158
00:09:30,109 --> 00:09:32,677
- Actually, when we speak,

159
00:09:32,678 --> 00:09:34,612
our voices produce sound waves.

160
00:09:34,613 --> 00:09:36,347
Radio takes those sound waves

161
00:09:36,348 --> 00:09:39,417
and converts them
into electromagnetic energy

162
00:09:39,418 --> 00:09:41,319
that is transmitted
through the spectrum--

163
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:43,121
- All right, enough.

164
00:09:43,122 --> 00:09:45,256
I did not know this.

165
00:09:45,257 --> 00:09:48,092
Apparently, I have been fed
some misinformation

166
00:09:48,093 --> 00:09:51,863
about the existence
of tiny men in boxes.

167
00:09:53,666 --> 00:09:57,168
Still, I'm not interested
in that human garbage.

168
00:09:57,169 --> 00:09:58,503
Now go away.

169
00:09:58,504 --> 00:10:00,438
- My grandfather was the Avatar,

170
00:10:00,439 --> 00:10:02,040
and I came to the spirit world

171
00:10:02,041 --> 00:10:04,976
with the new Avatar
to find the spirit portals.

172
00:10:04,977 --> 00:10:06,911
I would think
that you'd wanna help me.

173
00:10:06,912 --> 00:10:09,647
- You came with the Avatar, hm?

174
00:10:09,648 --> 00:10:12,016
Well, why didn't you say so?

175
00:10:12,017 --> 00:10:14,252
Fine, you may look around,

176
00:10:14,253 --> 00:10:16,954
but don't break anything.

177
00:10:16,955 --> 00:10:21,955
I'll know.

178
00:10:22,628 --> 00:10:25,363
- Come on, Furry-Foot.
We gotta hurry.

179
00:10:25,364 --> 00:10:27,865
- They say that the game of Pai Sho

180
00:10:27,866 --> 00:10:30,435
was invented by the spirits,

181
00:10:30,436 --> 00:10:32,103
although some of them don't seem

182
00:10:32,104 --> 00:10:33,705
to grasp it very well.

183
00:10:33,706 --> 00:10:35,673
- Just hold on.

184
00:10:35,674 --> 00:10:36,974
I'm thinking.

185
00:10:36,975 --> 00:10:39,243
- As you can see, it is a game

186
00:10:39,244 --> 00:10:41,779
that requires great patience,

187
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:45,083
but time does not mean much
to us here.

188
00:10:45,084 --> 00:10:46,617
- How long have you lived here?

189
00:10:46,618 --> 00:10:49,554
- Oh, I've been here for many years.

190
00:10:49,555 --> 00:10:51,689
I had always enjoyed the company

191
00:10:51,690 --> 00:10:54,092
of the spirits, so when my work

192
00:10:54,093 --> 00:10:56,794
was done in the material world,

193
00:10:56,795 --> 00:10:59,630
I chose to leave my body behind

194
00:10:59,631 --> 00:11:02,700
and come to the spirit world.

195
00:11:02,701 --> 00:11:05,370
It can be a wonderful place,

196
00:11:05,371 --> 00:11:10,371
and I've made so many friends.

197
00:11:14,947 --> 00:11:18,383
Korra, what's wrong?

198
00:11:18,384 --> 00:11:20,251
- I came here with my friend,

199
00:11:20,252 --> 00:11:21,986
but I lost her,

200
00:11:21,987 --> 00:11:24,188
and now I'm all alone.

201
00:11:24,189 --> 00:11:26,391
- You're not alone, Korra.

202
00:11:26,392 --> 00:11:28,760
It's okay.

203
00:11:28,761 --> 00:11:30,695
- No.
It's not okay.

204
00:11:30,696 --> 00:11:33,197
Jinora's gone,
and I need to find her.

205
00:11:33,198 --> 00:11:35,099
She's lost,
and we need to go home.

206
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:37,268
I don't like the spirit world.

207
00:11:37,269 --> 00:11:40,371
I don't want
to be here anymore.

208
00:11:45,577 --> 00:11:47,745
- Did you say something to her?

209
00:11:47,746 --> 00:11:50,648
- Me? You're the one
with the big mouth.

210
00:11:50,649 --> 00:11:52,950
- Korra, please, stop.

211
00:11:52,951 --> 00:11:57,922
Look at what you're doing
to everyone.

212
00:11:57,923 --> 00:11:59,056
- I did that?

213
00:11:59,057 --> 00:12:00,925
- In the spirit world,

214
00:12:00,926 --> 00:12:04,462
your emotions become your reality,

215
00:12:04,463 --> 00:12:06,931
especially for the Avatar

216
00:12:06,932 --> 00:12:10,735
because you are the bridge
between the two worlds.

217
00:12:10,736 --> 00:12:15,736
You must try to stay positive.

218
00:12:22,047 --> 00:12:27,047
I'm sorry.

219
00:12:32,524 --> 00:12:34,725
- There. You see?

220
00:12:34,726 --> 00:12:36,928
- I can make the sun shine?

221
00:12:36,929 --> 00:12:38,896
- Even in the material world,

222
00:12:38,897 --> 00:12:41,199
you will find
that if you look for the light,

223
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,367
you can often find it.

224
00:12:43,368 --> 00:12:45,670
But if you look for the dark,

225
00:12:45,671 --> 00:12:49,407
that is all you will ever see.

226
00:12:49,408 --> 00:12:50,708
- I'm looking for my friend.

227
00:12:50,709 --> 00:12:55,513
I want her here now.

228
00:12:55,514 --> 00:12:57,615
Why didn't she come out
like the sun?

229
00:12:57,616 --> 00:13:00,718
- I'm afraid finding her
won't be so easy.

230
00:13:00,719 --> 00:13:02,353
- But what am I supposed to do?

231
00:13:02,354 --> 00:13:04,689
- Sometimes, the best way to solve

232
00:13:04,690 --> 00:13:08,326
your own problems
is to help someone else.

233
00:13:08,327 --> 00:13:11,929
This little fellow needs
to go home as well.

234
00:13:11,930 --> 00:13:15,166
Maybe if you help him find his friends,

235
00:13:15,167 --> 00:13:18,936
you will be able to find yours.

236
00:13:18,937 --> 00:13:20,738
- I'll take him home.

237
00:13:20,739 --> 00:13:21,806
Where do I go?

238
00:13:21,807 --> 00:13:23,674
- The dragon-bird nest

239
00:13:23,675 --> 00:13:25,209
is located there,

240
00:13:25,210 --> 00:13:30,210
at the top of Hai-Riyo Peak.

241
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:43,861
It's not in here either.

242
00:13:43,862 --> 00:13:45,563
I have to find the portals.

243
00:13:45,564 --> 00:13:48,332
Korra's probably waiting for me
there right now.

244
00:13:48,333 --> 00:13:49,467
I need to find a map

245
00:13:49,468 --> 00:13:51,836
that shows
where the spirit portals are.

246
00:13:51,837 --> 00:13:53,137
Could you help me?

247
00:14:08,587 --> 00:14:13,587
Thanks.
This is it.

248
00:14:13,992 --> 00:14:16,027
The Tree of Time.

249
00:14:16,028 --> 00:14:18,930
That's where Avatar Wan
imprisoned Vaatu.

250
00:14:18,931 --> 00:14:21,465
"The elders believed
that as long as the portals

251
00:14:21,466 --> 00:14:24,001
"are closed during
the harmonic convergence,

252
00:14:24,002 --> 00:14:25,870
"Vaatu will remain imprisoned

253
00:14:25,871 --> 00:14:27,638
"and the battle between good and evil

254
00:14:27,639 --> 00:14:29,740
"will not be fought again.

255
00:14:29,741 --> 00:14:31,709
"But if both portals are opened,

256
00:14:31,710 --> 00:14:35,012
"spirit energy is amplified greatly.

257
00:14:35,013 --> 00:14:36,914
"During the harmonic convergence,

258
00:14:36,915 --> 00:14:38,449
"this energy will be great enough

259
00:14:38,450 --> 00:14:41,452
"to allow Vaatu
to break free from his bonds,

260
00:14:41,453 --> 00:14:43,554
"and the material world
will again risk

261
00:14:43,555 --> 00:14:46,390
being consumed by darkness."

262
00:14:47,526 --> 00:14:50,528
We have to warn Korra.
- Leaving so soon?

263
00:14:50,529 --> 00:14:53,931
When Wan Shi Tong told me
he had a visitor,

264
00:14:53,932 --> 00:14:56,033
I had to see it with my own eyes.

265
00:14:56,034 --> 00:14:58,636
I can't believe Tenzin
sent his daughter here

266
00:14:58,637 --> 00:15:00,438
instead of coming himself.

267
00:15:00,439 --> 00:15:02,406
What kind of a father is he?

268
00:15:02,407 --> 00:15:03,808
- Better than you.

269
00:15:03,809 --> 00:15:06,911
Wan Shi Tong,
how can you be helping him?

270
00:15:06,912 --> 00:15:09,647
- Unalaq has proven to be
a true friend

271
00:15:09,648 --> 00:15:12,750
to the spirits,
unlike the Avatar.

272
00:15:12,751 --> 00:15:15,219
- Why would you wanna help
Vaatu escape?

273
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:16,988
He'll destroy everything.

274
00:15:16,989 --> 00:15:19,924
- Don't believe everything you read.

275
00:15:19,925 --> 00:15:21,726
Why don't you come with me

276
00:15:21,727 --> 00:15:24,795
so you can do
some first-hand research?

277
00:15:31,470 --> 00:15:36,470
Furry-Foot?

278
00:15:41,313 --> 00:15:43,080
- This looks scary.

279
00:15:43,081 --> 00:15:45,549
Will you come with me?

280
00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:49,754
- This is something
that you must do on your own.

281
00:15:49,755 --> 00:15:51,322
The people who have been coming

282
00:15:51,323 --> 00:15:53,157
to the spirit world lately

283
00:15:53,158 --> 00:15:56,260
have brought darkness and anger,

284
00:15:56,261 --> 00:15:58,796
so that is what you see now.

285
00:15:58,797 --> 00:16:01,999
But you have light
and peace inside of you.

286
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,501
If you let it out,

287
00:16:03,502 --> 00:16:08,172
you can change the world around you.

288
00:16:08,173 --> 00:16:11,575
Besides, look at this little fellow.

289
00:16:11,576 --> 00:16:14,011
This mountain is his home.

290
00:16:14,012 --> 00:16:17,481
When you first met him,
you were frightened.

291
00:16:17,482 --> 00:16:20,818
But does he seem scary to you now?

292
00:16:20,819 --> 00:16:21,886
- No.

293
00:16:21,887 --> 00:16:24,188
- Many things that seem threatening

294
00:16:24,189 --> 00:16:26,891
in the dark become welcoming

295
00:16:26,892 --> 00:16:31,892
when we shine a light on them.

296
00:16:32,297 --> 00:16:34,765
It was good to meet you.

297
00:16:34,766 --> 00:16:36,500
Come visit me again,

298
00:16:36,501 --> 00:16:39,804
in this life or the next.

299
00:16:39,805 --> 00:16:41,872
- Bye.

300
00:16:41,873 --> 00:16:46,873
Okay.
Time for you to go home.

301
00:17:03,328 --> 00:17:05,129
Light and peace.

302
00:17:05,130 --> 00:17:10,130
Light
and peace.

303
00:17:20,712 --> 00:17:23,981
- I'm not afraid of you.

304
00:17:23,982 --> 00:17:26,183
You're not scary.

305
00:17:26,184 --> 00:17:27,785
You just look that way.

306
00:17:27,786 --> 00:17:30,721
I have light inside.

307
00:17:30,722 --> 00:17:34,325
It's okay.
You can be my friends.

308
00:17:34,326 --> 00:17:37,261
My name is Korra, and I'm taking
this dragon-bird home.

309
00:17:51,743 --> 00:17:53,744
lroh said you could be nice.

310
00:17:53,745 --> 00:17:58,745
Do you wanna help me?

311
00:18:39,257 --> 00:18:41,392
All right,
now let's close that portal

312
00:18:41,393 --> 00:18:43,227
and go find Jinora.

313
00:18:59,110 --> 00:19:04,110
That's where Vaatu is.

314
00:19:14,492 --> 00:19:19,492
- So you've returned, Raava.

315
00:19:20,332 --> 00:19:24,068
The harmonic convergence
is coming soon,

316
00:19:24,069 --> 00:19:28,973
and this time,
I'm going to wipe you out for good.

317
00:19:28,974 --> 00:19:31,609
- I think
you've said that before, Vaatu,

318
00:19:31,610 --> 00:19:33,711
but I'm here to close the portal.

319
00:19:33,712 --> 00:19:36,947
You're not getting out.

320
00:19:36,948 --> 00:19:40,217
- You might want to reconsider,

321
00:19:40,218 --> 00:19:45,218
that is,
if you want to save your friend.

322
00:19:50,495 --> 00:19:54,398
- Jinora.

323
00:20:01,473 --> 00:20:03,407
I can't believe I trusted you.

324
00:20:03,408 --> 00:20:04,475
You made me think you wanted

325
00:20:04,476 --> 00:20:06,176
to restore balance with the spirits.

326
00:20:06,177 --> 00:20:07,745
But this, this isn't balance.

327
00:20:07,746 --> 00:20:09,013
It's madness.

328
00:20:09,014 --> 00:20:10,214
Now let her go.

329
00:20:10,215 --> 00:20:11,749
- If you want your friend to make it

330
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:13,717
out of the spirit world, you'll open

331
00:20:13,718 --> 00:20:15,786
the other portal now.

332
00:20:15,787 --> 00:20:19,089
- Don't do it, Korra.

333
00:20:24,663 --> 00:20:26,864
- What will it be?

334
00:20:26,865 --> 00:20:28,899
Open the portal,

335
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:31,869
or lose your friend's soul forever?

336
00:20:34,539 --> 00:20:38,809
- Stop.

337
00:20:38,810 --> 00:20:40,644
I'll do it.

338
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:32,096
Now, let Jinora go.

339
00:21:32,097 --> 00:21:34,164
Ah!

340
00:21:34,165 --> 00:21:36,100
You should have come
through the portal.

341
00:21:36,101 --> 00:21:37,568
Then you could do this.

342
00:21:45,243 --> 00:21:47,144
Korra!

343
00:22:31,923 --> 00:22:34,725
- I'll see you soon, Raava.

344
00:22:34,726 --> 00:22:37,461
Once the harmonic convergence comes,

345
00:22:37,462 --> 00:22:40,097
I'll be free from this prison.

346
00:22:40,098 --> 00:22:45,098
And then I will have my revenge.

347
00:22:49,407 --> 00:22:51,508
- Korra.

348
00:22:51,509 --> 00:22:52,709
What was it like?

349
00:22:52,710 --> 00:22:54,178
Did you manage to close the portal?

350
00:22:54,179 --> 00:22:56,380
Was Jinora able to help you?

351
00:22:56,381 --> 00:23:01,381
- Tenzin, I'm-- I'm sorry.

352
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:05,856
- Where's Jinora?

353
00:23:05,857 --> 00:23:10,194
W-why isn't she waking up?

354
00:23:10,195 --> 00:23:11,428
Korra.

355
00:23:11,429 --> 00:23:16,429
What happened to my little girl?
