00:09:04,542 --> 00:09:06,542
- THOSE ARE
THE OLD RULES.

183
00:09:06,583 --> 00:09:08,458
BESIDES, WHAT IS
A LITTLE GIRL

184
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:10,458
GOING TO TEACH
WAN SHI TONG,

185
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:13,792
HE WHO KNOWS
10,000 THINGS?

186
00:09:13,834 --> 00:09:15,750
- WELL, SINCE YOU'VE BEEN DOWN
IN THE SPIRIT WORLD,

187
00:09:15,792 --> 00:09:18,166
THE HUMANS HAVE
INVENTED RADIO.

188
00:09:18,208 --> 00:09:20,542
- YES, I AM WELL AWARE
OF THE RADIO.

189
00:09:20,583 --> 00:09:22,875
- BUT DO YOU KNOW
HOW IT WORKS?

190
00:09:22,917 --> 00:09:24,625
- OF COURSE I DO.

191
00:09:24,667 --> 00:09:26,709
THERE IS A BOX,
AND INSIDE THE BOX,

192
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:28,291
THERE IS A TINY MAN
WHO SINGS

193
00:09:28,333 --> 00:09:30,417
AND PLAYS MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS.

194
00:09:30,458 --> 00:09:33,125
- ACTUALLY, WHEN WE SPEAK,

195
00:09:33,166 --> 00:09:35,083
OUR VOICES PRODUCE
SOUND WAVES.

196
00:09:35,125 --> 00:09:36,750
RADIO TAKES
THOSE SOUND WAVES

197
00:09:36,792 --> 00:09:39,834
AND CONVERTS THEM
INTO ELECTROMAGNETIC ENERGY

198
00:09:39,875 --> 00:09:41,709
THAT IS TRANSMITTED
THROUGH THE SPECTRUM--

199
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:43,458
- ALL RIGHT, ENOUGH.

200
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,875
I DID NOT
KNOW THIS.

201
00:09:45,917 --> 00:09:48,667
APPARENTLY, I HAVE BEEN FED
SOME MISINFORMATION

202
00:09:48,709 --> 00:09:52,125
ABOUT THE EXISTENCE OF TINY MEN
IN BOXES.

203
00:09:52,166 --> 00:09:54,125
[dog squeaks]

204
00:09:54,166 --> 00:09:57,500
STILL, I'M NOT INTERESTED
IN THAT HUMAN GARBAGE.

205
00:09:57,542 --> 00:09:58,917
NOW GO AWAY.

206
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:00,834
- MY GRANDFATHER WAS
THE AVATAR,

207
00:10:00,875 --> 00:10:02,583
AND I CAME
TO THE SPIRIT WORLD

208
00:10:02,625 --> 00:10:05,500
WITH THE NEW AVATAR
TO FIND THE SPIRIT PORTALS.

209
00:10:05,542 --> 00:10:07,417
I WOULD THINK
THAT YOU'D WANNA HELP ME.

210
00:10:07,458 --> 00:10:10,083
- YOU CAME
WITH THE AVATAR, HM?

211
00:10:10,125 --> 00:10:12,542
WELL, WHY DIDN'T
YOU SAY SO?

212
00:10:12,583 --> 00:10:14,583
FINE, YOU MAY
LOOK AROUND,

213
00:10:14,625 --> 00:10:17,250
BUT DON'T BREAK ANYTHING.

214
00:10:17,291 --> 00:10:20,458
I'LL KNOW.

215
00:10:23,083 --> 00:10:25,709
- COME ON, FURRY-FOOT.
WE GOTTA HURRY.

216
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:28,333
- THEY SAY THAT THE GAME
OF PAI SHO

217
00:10:28,375 --> 00:10:30,792
WAS INVENTED
BY THE SPIRITS,

218
00:10:30,834 --> 00:10:32,375
ALTHOUGH SOME OF THEM
DON'T SEEM

219
00:10:32,417 --> 00:10:33,875
TO GRASP IT
VERY WELL.

220
00:10:33,917 --> 00:10:36,083
- JUST HOLD ON.

221
00:10:36,125 --> 00:10:37,458
I'M THINKING.

222
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,542
- AS YOU CAN SEE,
IT IS A GAME

223
00:10:39,583 --> 00:10:42,208
THAT REQUIRES GREAT PATIENCE,

224
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:45,333
BUT TIME DOES NOT MEAN MUCH
TO US HERE.

225
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:47,041
- HOW LONG HAVE
YOU LIVED HERE?

226
00:10:47,083 --> 00:10:49,917
- OH, I'VE BEEN HERE
FOR MANY YEARS.

227
00:10:49,959 --> 00:10:52,083
- I HAD ALWAYS ENJOYED
THE COMPANY

228
00:10:52,125 --> 00:10:54,333
OF THE SPIRITS,
SO WHEN MY WORK

229
00:10:54,375 --> 00:10:57,208
WAS DONE
IN THE MATERIAL WORLD,

230
00:10:57,250 --> 00:11:00,125
I CHOSE TO LEAVE
MY BODY BEHIND

231
00:11:00,166 --> 00:11:03,208
AND COME
TO THE SPIRIT WORLD.

232
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:05,792
IT CAN BE
A WONDERFUL PLACE,

233
00:11:05,834 --> 00:11:09,750
AND I'VE MADE
SO MANY FRIENDS.

234
00:11:15,291 --> 00:11:18,792
KORRA, WHAT'S WRONG?

235
00:11:18,834 --> 00:11:20,625
- I CAME HERE
WITH MY FRIEND,

236
00:11:20,667 --> 00:11:22,291
BUT I LOST HER,

237
00:11:22,333 --> 00:11:24,542
AND NOW
I'M ALL ALONE.

238
00:11:24,583 --> 00:11:26,792
- YOU'RE NOT ALONE, KORRA.

239
00:11:26,834 --> 00:11:29,250
IT'S OKAY.

240
00:11:29,291 --> 00:11:31,166
- NO.
IT'S NOT OKAY.

241
00:11:31,208 --> 00:11:33,792
JINORA'S GONE,
AND I NEED TO FIND HER.

242
00:11:33,834 --> 00:11:35,667
SHE'S LOST,
AND WE NEED TO GO HOME.

243
00:11:35,709 --> 00:11:37,625
I DON'T LIKE
THE SPIRIT WORLD.

244
00:11:37,667 --> 00:11:40,750
I DON'T WANT
TO BE HERE ANYMORE.

245
00:11:40,792 --> 00:11:42,083
[screams]

246
00:11:42,125 --> 00:11:43,583
- [growls]

247
00:11:43,625 --> 00:11:46,000
[howls]

248
00:11:46,041 --> 00:11:48,208
- DID YOU SAY SOMETHING
TO HER?

249
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:51,083
- ME? YOU'RE THE ONE
WITH THE BIG MOUTH.

250
00:11:51,125 --> 00:11:53,458
- KORRA, PLEASE, STOP.

251
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:58,166
LOOK AT WHAT YOU'RE DOING
TO EVERYONE.

252
00:11:58,208 --> 00:11:59,417
- I DID THAT?

253
00:11:59,458 --> 00:12:01,500
- IN THE SPIRIT WORLD,

254
00:12:01,542 --> 00:12:04,917
YOUR EMOTIONS BECOME
YOUR REALITY,

255
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:07,500
ESPECIALLY FOR THE AVATAR

256
00:12:07,542 --> 00:12:11,250
BECAUSE YOU ARE THE BRIDGE
BETWEEN THE TWO WORLDS.

257
00:12:11,291 --> 00:12:14,125
YOU MUST TRY
TO STAY POSITIVE.

258
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:22,417
- [sniffles]

259
00:12:22,458 --> 00:12:27,166
I'M SORRY.

260
00:12:33,041 --> 00:12:35,250
- THERE.
YOU SEE?

261
00:12:35,291 --> 00:12:37,500
- I CAN MAKE
THE SUN SHINE?

262
00:12:37,542 --> 00:12:39,458
- EVEN IN
THE MATERIAL WORLD,

263
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,583
YOU WILL FIND THAT IF YOU LOOK
FOR THE LIGHT,

264
00:12:41,625 --> 00:12:43,792
YOU CAN OFTEN
FIND IT.

265
00:12:43,834 --> 00:12:46,166
BUT IF YOU LOOK
FOR THE DARK,

266
00:12:46,208 --> 00:12:49,834
THAT IS ALL
YOU WILL EVER SEE.

267
00:12:49,875 --> 00:12:51,208
- I'M LOOKING
FOR MY FRIEND.

268
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:53,583
I WANT HER HERE NOW.

269
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,083
WHY DIDN'T SHE COME OUT
LIKE THE SUN?

270
00:12:58,125 --> 00:13:01,291
- I'M AFRAID FINDING HER
WON'T BE SO EASY.

271
00:13:01,333 --> 00:13:02,792
- BUT WHAT AM I SUPPOSED
TO DO?

272
00:13:02,834 --> 00:13:05,250
- SOMETIMES, THE BEST WAY
TO SOLVE

273
00:13:05,291 --> 00:13:08,792
YOUR OWN PROBLEMS
IS TO HELP SOMEONE ELSE.

274
00:13:08,834 --> 00:13:12,542
THIS LITTLE FELLOW NEEDS
TO GO HOME AS WELL.

275
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:15,583
MAYBE IF YOU HELP HIM
FIND HIS FRIENDS,

276
00:13:15,625 --> 00:13:19,291
YOU WILL BE ABLE
TO FIND YOURS.

277
00:13:19,333 --> 00:13:21,041
- I'LL TAKE HIM HOME.

278
00:13:21,083 --> 00:13:22,375
WHERE DO I GO?

279
00:13:22,417 --> 00:13:24,208
- THE DRAGON-BIRD NEST

280
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:25,625
IS LOCATED THERE,

281
00:13:25,667 --> 00:13:28,583
AT THE TOP
OF HAI-RIYO PEAK.

282
00:13:41,834 --> 00:13:44,417
- [sighs]
IT'S NOT IN HERE EITHER.

283
00:13:44,458 --> 00:13:46,041
I HAVE TO FIND
THE PORTALS.

284
00:13:46,083 --> 00:13:48,792
KORRA'S PROBABLY WAITING FOR ME
THERE RIGHT NOW.

285
00:13:48,834 --> 00:13:50,125
I NEED TO FIND
A MAP

286
00:13:50,166 --> 00:13:52,166
THAT SHOWS
WHERE THE SPIRIT PORTALS ARE.

287
00:13:52,208 --> 00:13:53,542
COULD YOU HELP ME?

288
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:56,500
[dog groans]

289
00:13:58,917 --> 00:14:00,458
[dog whimpers]

290
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:04,375
[dog panting]

291
00:14:09,208 --> 00:14:12,542
THANKS.
THIS IS IT.

292
00:14:14,458 --> 00:14:16,709
THE TREE OF TIME.

293
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:19,583
THAT'S WHERE AVATAR WAN
IMPRISONED VAATU.

294
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:22,000
"THE ELDERS BELIEVED

[gasps]

00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:51,041
WE HAVE TO WARN KORRA.
- LEAVING SO SOON?

308
00:14:51,083 --> 00:14:54,542
WHEN WAN SHI TONG TOLD ME
HE HAD A VISITOR,

309
00:14:54,583 --> 00:14:56,667
I HAD TO SEE IT
WITH MY OWN EYES.

310
00:14:56,709 --> 00:14:59,166
I CAN'T BELIEVE TENZIN
SENT HIS DAUGHTER HERE

311
00:14:59,208 --> 00:15:01,000
INSTEAD OF COMING HIMSELF.

312
00:15:01,041 --> 00:15:02,959
WHAT KIND OF A FATHER
IS HE?

313
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,458
- BETTER THAN YOU.

314
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:07,583
WAN SHI TONG,
HOW CAN YOU BE HELPING HIM?

315
00:15:07,625 --> 00:15:10,291
- UNALAQ HAS PROVEN TO BE
A TRUE FRIEND

316
00:15:10,333 --> 00:15:13,417
TO THE SPIRITS,
UNLIKE THE AVATAR.

317
00:15:13,458 --> 00:15:15,750
- WHY WOULD YOU WANNA HELP
VAATU ESCAPE?

318
00:15:15,792 --> 00:15:17,709
HE'LL DESTROY EVERYTHING.

319
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:20,625
- DON'T BELIEVE EVERYTHING
YOU READ.

320
00:15:20,667 --> 00:15:22,375
WHY DON'T YOU COME
WITH ME

321
00:15:22,417 --> 00:15:25,208
SO YOU CAN DO
SOME FIRST-HAND RESEARCH?

322
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:27,834
- [gasps]

323
00:15:27,875 --> 00:15:29,000

FURRY-FOOT?

326
00:15:41,875 --> 00:15:43,542
- THIS LOOKS SCARY.

327
00:15:43,583 --> 00:15:46,083
WILL YOU COME
WITH ME?

328
00:15:46,125 --> 00:15:50,333
- THIS IS SOMETHING
THAT YOU MUST DO ON YOUR OWN.

329
00:15:50,375 --> 00:15:51,792
THE PEOPLE
WHO HAVE BEEN COMING

330
00:15:51,834 --> 00:15:53,625
TO THE SPIRIT
WORLD LATELY

331
00:15:53,667 --> 00:15:56,750
HAVE BROUGHT DARKNESS
AND ANGER,

332
00:15:56,792 --> 00:15:59,417
SO THAT IS WHAT
YOU SEE NOW.

333
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:02,500
BUT YOU HAVE LIGHT AND PEACE
INSIDE OF YOU.

334

IF YOU LET IT OUT,

335
00:16:04,166 --> 00:16:08,709
YOU CAN CHANGE THE WORLD
AROUND YOU.

336
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:12,208
BESIDES, LOOK
AT THIS LITTLE FELLOW.

337
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:14,750
THIS MOUNTAIN IS
HIS HOME.

338
00:16:14,792 --> 00:16:18,083
WHEN YOU FIRST MET HIM,
YOU WERE FRIGHTENED.

339
00:16:18,125 --> 00:16:21,250
BUT DOES HE SEEM SCARY
TO YOU NOW?

340
00:16:21,291 --> 00:16:22,750
- NO.

341
00:16:22,792 --> 00:16:24,709
- MANY THINGS
THAT SEEM THREATENING

342
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:27,583

ON THEM.

IT WAS GOOD
TO MEET YOU.

345
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:37,125
COME VISIT ME AGAIN,

346
00:16:37,166 --> 00:16:40,250
IN THIS LIFE
OR THE NEXT.

347
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:42,583
- BYE.

348
00:16:42,625 --> 00:16:46,083
OKAY.
TIME FOR YOU TO GO HOME.

00:16:58,208 --> 00:17:01,667

- I'M NOT AFRAID
OF YOU.

355
00:17:25,417 --> 00:17:27,625
YOU'RE NOT SCARY.
