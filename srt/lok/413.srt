1
00:00:06,424 --> 00:00:07,842
- Tenzin: EARTH.

2
00:00:07,925 --> 00:00:09,719
FIRE.

3
00:00:09,802 --> 00:00:11,512
AIR.

4
00:00:11,595 --> 00:00:12,847
WATER.

5
00:00:14,015 --> 00:00:17,727
ONLY THE AVATAR CAN MASTER
ALL FOUR ELEMENTS

6
00:00:17,810 --> 00:00:20,104
AND BRING BALANCE TO THE WORLD.

7
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:27,695
Shiro: REPUBLIC CITY
IS A WAR ZONE!

8
00:00:27,778 --> 00:00:30,364
WHILE PRINCE WU LED THE
REMAINING CITIZENS TO SAFETY,

9
00:00:30,448 --> 00:00:32,533
TEAM AVATAR BATTLED
KUVIRA'S GIANT MECH,

10
00:00:32,616 --> 00:00:34,660
BUT NO AMOUNT OF BENDING
COULD BRING IT DOWN!

11
00:00:34,744 --> 00:00:36,662
IN A LAST DITCH EFFORT,
ASAMI AND HER FATHER

12
00:00:36,746 --> 00:00:39,040
OUTFITTED THE HUMMINGBIRD
SUITS WITH PLATINUM CUTTERS.

13
00:00:39,123 --> 00:00:41,834
HIROSHI HELPED TEAM AVATAR
INFILTRATE THE MECHA-GIANT,

14
00:00:41,917 --> 00:00:43,836
BUT HE PAID THE ULTIMATE PRICE.

15
00:00:43,919 --> 00:00:45,963
IS VICTORY WITHIN REACH
FOR OUR HEROES?

16
00:01:17,328 --> 00:01:18,704
- INITIATE LOCKDOWN.

17
00:01:18,788 --> 00:01:21,207
FIND THE AVATAR
AND WHOEVER ELSE IS WITH HER.

18
00:01:22,124 --> 00:01:23,709
- Korra: WE NEED TO MOVE FAST.

19
00:01:23,793 --> 00:01:26,587
SU, LIN, CLIMB UP TO THE ARM AND TRY
TO DISABLE THAT WEAPON.

20
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:28,506
MAKO, BOLIN, GET TO THE ENGINE

21
00:01:28,589 --> 00:01:30,049
AND SEE IF YOU CAN POWER
THIS THING DOWN.

22
00:01:30,132 --> 00:01:31,383
I'M GOING AFTER KUVIRA.

23
00:01:31,467 --> 00:01:32,551
- Suyin: ARE YOU SURE?

24
00:01:32,635 --> 00:01:34,178
WHEN YOU FOUGHT KUVIRA BEFORE...

25
00:01:34,261 --> 00:01:37,098
I KNOW.
SHE ALMOST DESTROYED ME.

26
00:01:37,181 --> 00:01:38,766
NOT THIS TIME.

27
00:01:52,696 --> 00:01:55,533
I'M GOING FOR THAT LEVER.
YOU GET THE OTHER ONE.

28
00:01:55,866 --> 00:01:57,034
- HEY!

29
00:02:00,287 --> 00:02:01,288
OOH!

30
00:02:27,606 --> 00:02:30,734
I'LL DEAL WITH THIS GUY.
DISABLE THE WEAPON!

31
00:02:58,220 --> 00:02:59,180
NICE WORK.

32
00:02:59,263 --> 00:03:00,681
- THE OUTSIDE MAY BE PLATINUM,

33
00:03:00,764 --> 00:03:02,933
BUT WE CAN DO
A LOT OF DAMAGE IN HERE.

34
00:03:05,603 --> 00:03:08,022
THE WEAPON'S LOADING
MECHANISM HAS MALFUNCTIONED.

35
00:03:08,105 --> 00:03:10,232
- WE'RE UNABLE TO FIRE.
- IT'S NO MALFUNCTION.

36
00:03:10,316 --> 00:03:12,860
I CAN FEEL SOMEONE
METALBENDING INSIDE THE ARM.

37
00:03:17,615 --> 00:03:20,951
I LOST THE CONNECTION.
THE WEAPON'S USELESS NOW.

38
00:04:01,617 --> 00:04:02,993
OOH!

39
00:04:11,377 --> 00:04:12,836
- AH! UH!

40
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,088
AH!

41
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,721
UH!

42
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:31,021
- OOH-AH!

43
00:04:43,158 --> 00:04:44,159
I'M READY!

44
00:04:44,868 --> 00:04:48,038
BE WITH YOU IN ONE SECOND!
KIND OF BUSY!

45
00:04:55,296 --> 00:04:56,338
- OOH-AH! UH!

46
00:04:57,339 --> 00:04:58,674
- OKAY! READY NOW!

47
00:05:00,968 --> 00:05:02,094
- ONE.

48
00:05:02,177 --> 00:05:03,304
TWO.

49
00:05:03,387 --> 00:05:04,388
THREE!

50
00:05:04,596 --> 00:05:05,848
NOTHING'S HAPPENING.

51
00:05:05,931 --> 00:05:07,975
KUVIRA MUST HAVE DONE
SOME OVERRIDE THING

52
00:05:08,058 --> 00:05:09,310
AND TAKEN CONTROL!

53
00:05:09,393 --> 00:05:10,519
THERE'S GOT
TO BE SOME OTHER WAY

54
00:05:10,602 --> 00:05:12,813
TO SHUT DOWN POWER FROM HERE.

55
00:05:12,896 --> 00:05:15,858
- UM...
- COME ON.

56
00:05:15,941 --> 00:05:18,277
YOU SPENT ALL THAT TIME
WORKING WITH VARRICK AND BAATAR JR.

57
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,321
DIDN'T ANY OF THEIR GENIUS
RUB OFF ON YOU?

58
00:05:20,404 --> 00:05:22,406
LOOK, THE ONLY THING I KNOW
ABOUT THESE VINES IS THAT

59
00:05:22,489 --> 00:05:25,034
IF YOU MESS AROUND WITH THEM
TOO MUCH, THEY EXPLODE.

60
00:05:32,875 --> 00:05:34,668
GET THOSE ENGINEERS
OUT OF HERE.

61
00:05:34,752 --> 00:05:36,837
- I HAVE AN IDEA.
- WANT TO FILL ME IN?

62
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:39,340
I'M GONNA ZAP THESE VINES
WITH SOME ELECTRICITY.

63
00:05:39,423 --> 00:05:40,674
- LET'S BACK IT UP, OKAY?

64
00:05:40,758 --> 00:05:43,302
I SAID THAT WILL MAKE
THE VINES EXPLODE.

65
00:05:43,385 --> 00:05:44,345
- EXACTLY.

66
00:05:44,428 --> 00:05:46,680
THIS IS OUR ONLY WAY
OF SHUTTING THIS THING DOWN.

67
00:05:46,764 --> 00:05:49,058
- I CAN HANDLE IT.
- NO, YOU CAN'T.

68
00:05:49,141 --> 00:05:51,518
THIS ISN'T THE TIME TO PROVE
HOW AWESOME YOU ARE.

69
00:05:51,602 --> 00:05:54,563
I ALREADY KNOW
HOW AWESOME YOU ARE.

70
00:05:54,646 --> 00:05:55,689
YOU'RE AWESOME.

71
00:05:55,773 --> 00:05:57,441
- I DON'T HAVE TIME TO ARGUE.

72
00:05:57,524 --> 00:05:59,860
I'M DOING THIS, SO GET OUT OF HERE.

73
00:06:01,528 --> 00:06:02,738
- OKAY.

74
00:06:02,821 --> 00:06:04,865
BUT FOR THE RECORD, I DO NOT APPROVE.

75
00:06:04,948 --> 00:06:07,534
JUST GET OUT AS SOON AS YOU CAN.

76
00:06:07,618 --> 00:06:08,619
PROMISE?

77
00:06:10,162 --> 00:06:12,164
- PROMISE.

78
00:06:12,247 --> 00:06:14,208
- I LOVE YOU.
- I LOVE YOU, TOO.

79
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:15,501
NOW GO!

80
00:07:04,466 --> 00:07:06,301
AAH-OOH!

81
00:07:19,565 --> 00:07:20,941
- HA-AHH!

82
00:08:07,738 --> 00:08:09,031
AH!

83
00:08:34,348 --> 00:08:35,516
IT'S OVER.

84
00:08:36,683 --> 00:08:37,851
YOU'RE GONNA CALL OFF YOUR ARMY

85
00:08:37,935 --> 00:08:40,062
AND SURRENDER TO PRESIDENT RAIKO.

86
00:08:40,145 --> 00:08:41,855
THEN YOU AND...UH!

87
00:08:50,989 --> 00:08:52,282
STOP!

88
00:09:05,712 --> 00:09:07,589
- Korra: KUVIRA! GIVE UP!

89
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:09,466
- NEVER.

90
00:09:17,724 --> 00:09:21,520
PLEASE, STOP THIS MADNESS!
IT HAS TO END NOW!

91
00:09:23,105 --> 00:09:24,731
Kuvira:
IF YOU REALLY WANT TO END IT,

92
00:09:24,815 --> 00:09:26,441
THEN COME AND GET ME!

93
00:09:34,157 --> 00:09:35,701
- NOW IT'S OVER.

94
00:09:35,784 --> 00:09:36,910
- DON'T!

95
00:10:10,861 --> 00:10:11,862
SHUT IT DOWN!

96
00:10:14,114 --> 00:10:15,490
- I CAN'T!

97
00:10:15,574 --> 00:10:17,659
AH!

98
00:11:32,901 --> 00:11:34,069
LOOK!

99
00:11:39,241 --> 00:11:41,535
- A NEW SPIRIT PORTAL.

100
00:11:43,078 --> 00:11:45,205
- SPREAD OUT AND FIND KUVIRA.

101
00:11:52,629 --> 00:11:53,839
- KORRA!

102
00:12:04,433 --> 00:12:06,184
TENZIN, THERE'S NO SIGN OF HER.

103
00:12:06,268 --> 00:12:07,644
- KEEP LOOKING.

104
00:12:07,728 --> 00:12:11,273
KORRA! KORRA!

105
00:12:42,387 --> 00:12:43,764
- UH-AHH!

106
00:12:45,724 --> 00:12:47,225
WHAT HAPPENED?

107
00:12:47,309 --> 00:12:49,895
ARE WE DEAD?

108
00:12:49,978 --> 00:12:51,438
- NO.

109
00:12:51,521 --> 00:12:54,441
WE'RE OKAY,
BUT WE'RE IN THE SPIRIT WORLD.

110
00:12:54,524 --> 00:12:57,110
ALL THE ENERGY FROM YOUR
WEAPON TORE OPEN A NEW PORTAL

111
00:12:57,194 --> 00:12:58,278
AND BLASTED US IN HERE.

112
00:12:59,696 --> 00:13:03,658
WHY WOULD YOU SAVE MY LIFE?
AFTER EVERYTHING I DID TO YOU.

113
00:13:03,992 --> 00:13:07,037
I GUESS I SEE
A LOT OF MYSELF IN YOU.

114
00:13:07,704 --> 00:13:09,206
- WE ARE NOTHING ALIKE.

115
00:13:09,414 --> 00:13:10,999
- YES, WE ARE.

116
00:13:11,082 --> 00:13:13,794
WE'RE BOTH FIERCE
AND DETERMINED TO SUCCEED,

117
00:13:13,877 --> 00:13:15,796
SOMETIMES WITHOUT
THINKING THINGS THROUGH.

118
00:13:15,879 --> 00:13:17,756
THIS WASN'T
HOW I WANTED THINGS TO END.

119
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:19,216
IF YOU HAD ALL JUST SURRENDERED,

120
00:13:19,299 --> 00:13:20,759
NONE OF THIS WOULD'VE HAPPENED.

121
00:13:20,842 --> 00:13:22,469
YOU BROUGHT THIS
ON YOURSELF.

122
00:13:22,552 --> 00:13:23,804
MESSING WITH THE SPIRIT VINES,

123
00:13:23,887 --> 00:13:25,722
ACTING LIKE A DICTATOR
OVER YOUR PEOPLE...

124
00:13:25,806 --> 00:13:28,266
YOU HAD TO KNOW WHAT YOU
WERE DOING WASN'T RIGHT.

125
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:30,769
I WAS TRYING
TO HELP MY PEOPLE.

126
00:13:30,852 --> 00:13:33,188
SU TURNED HER BACK
ON THE EARTH KINGDOM.

127
00:13:33,271 --> 00:13:36,024
YOU WERE GONE. I HAD TO DO SOMETHING.

128
00:13:36,107 --> 00:13:37,484
- I THINK I GET IT NOW.

129
00:13:37,567 --> 00:13:40,153
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND
ANYTHING ABOUT ME.

130
00:13:40,237 --> 00:13:41,696
- I DO.

131
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:44,449
SU TOLD ME HOW SHE TOOK YOU IN
WHEN YOU WERE YOUNGER.

132
00:13:44,533 --> 00:13:46,993
IT MUST HAVE BEEN SO HARD
BEING AN ORPHAN.

133
00:13:47,077 --> 00:13:49,371
DON'T PRETEND YOU KNOW
WHAT IT FELT LIKE.

134
00:13:49,454 --> 00:13:51,665
THE AVATAR IS ADORED BY MILLIONS!

135
00:13:51,748 --> 00:13:53,834
I WAS CAST ASIDE BY MY OWN PARENTS,

136
00:13:53,917 --> 00:13:55,669
LIKE I MEANT NOTHING TO THEM!

137
00:13:55,752 --> 00:13:58,797
HOW COULD I JUST STAND BY AND
WATCH THE SAME THING HAPPEN

138
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:02,008
TO MY NATION WHEN IT NEEDED
SOMEONE TO GUIDE IT?

139
00:14:02,092 --> 00:14:04,845
YOU WANTED TO CREATE A PLACE
WHERE YOU AND YOUR PEOPLE

140
00:14:04,928 --> 00:14:07,180
WOULD NEVER BE VULNERABLE AGAIN.

141
00:14:07,264 --> 00:14:09,933
I MAY NOT HAVE BEEN AN ORPHAN,
BUT BELIEVE ME,

142
00:14:10,016 --> 00:14:12,644
I UNDERSTAND WHAT IT FEELS
LIKE TO BE AFRAID.

143
00:14:13,979 --> 00:14:15,438
AFTER I WAS POISONED,

144
00:14:15,522 --> 00:14:18,024
I WOULD'VE DONE ANYTHING
TO FEEL IN CONTROL.

145
00:14:36,251 --> 00:14:38,795
- THE SPIRITS HAVE RETURNED.

146
00:14:42,173 --> 00:14:43,717
- AND SO HAS KORRA!

147
00:14:45,427 --> 00:14:47,554
- HA-HA! YOU'RE OKAY!

148
00:14:49,848 --> 00:14:52,142
RELEASE KUVIRA,
OR WE WILL ATTACK.

149
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:55,103
- STAND DOWN.

150
00:14:55,186 --> 00:14:56,730
THIS BATTLE IS OVER.

151
00:14:56,813 --> 00:14:59,024
I OWE THE AVATAR MY LIFE.

152
00:14:59,107 --> 00:15:03,111
HER POWER IS BEYOND ANYTHING
I COULD EVER HOPE TO ACHIEVE.

153
00:15:03,194 --> 00:15:06,698
I'LL ACCEPT WHATEVER
PUNISHMENT THE WORLD SEES FIT.

154
00:15:12,662 --> 00:15:14,331
AND SU, I'M SORRY

155
00:15:14,414 --> 00:15:17,334
FOR ALL THE ANGUISH
I'VE CAUSED YOU AND YOUR FAMILY.

156
00:15:17,417 --> 00:15:20,378
YOU'RE GOING TO ANSWER
FOR EVERYTHING YOU'VE DONE.

157
00:15:23,214 --> 00:15:24,966
- HA-HA!

158
00:15:31,681 --> 00:15:32,933
- Bolin: AND THOUGH THE BATTLE

159
00:15:33,016 --> 00:15:36,102
TOOK A SEVERE TOLL
ON OUR BELOVED CITY,

160
00:15:36,186 --> 00:15:39,105
OUT OF THE DESTRUCTION,
LOVE DID BLOOM.

161
00:15:39,189 --> 00:15:41,983
SO THAT IS WHY,
DEAREST FRIENDS AND FAMILY,

162
00:15:42,067 --> 00:15:44,778
WE GATHER TODAY TO CELEBRATE
THE WONDROUS

163
00:15:44,861 --> 00:15:46,821
AND AT TIMES INEXPLICABLE BOND

164
00:15:46,905 --> 00:15:50,200
BETWEEN SIR VARRICK
AND THE LADY ZHU LI!

165
00:15:52,243 --> 00:15:53,411
- HEY, PAL.

166
00:15:53,495 --> 00:15:56,081
CAMERA ON ME. THIS IS MY BIG DAY!

167
00:15:57,999 --> 00:16:00,794
TRUE LOVE
IS A FICKLE CREATURE,

168
00:16:00,877 --> 00:16:04,089
DIFFICULT TO FIND,
NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO TAME,

169
00:16:04,172 --> 00:16:05,966
BUT VARRICK AND ZHU LI HAVE PROVEN

170
00:16:06,049 --> 00:16:08,134
THAT EVEN THE LONGEST OF LONG SHOTS

171
00:16:08,218 --> 00:16:11,763
CAN HAVE A CHANCE
AT HAPPINESS TOGETHER.

172
00:16:11,846 --> 00:16:13,932
NOW FOR THE VOWS!

173
00:16:15,558 --> 00:16:16,977
THANK YOU, MASTER PABU.

174
00:16:18,561 --> 00:16:21,606
DO YOU, SIR IKNIK BLACKSTONE VARRICK

175
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:25,485
OF THE SOUTHERN WATER TRIBE,
MASTER OF THE HIGH SEAS,

176
00:16:25,568 --> 00:16:29,948
TAKE THE LADY ZHU LI MOON TO
BE YOUR LAWFULLY WEDDED WIFE?

177
00:16:30,031 --> 00:16:32,659
WILL YOU PROMISE TO TREAT HER
NOT AS YOUR ASSISTANT

178
00:16:32,742 --> 00:16:35,662
BUT AS YOUR HONORED
AND CHERISHED PARTNER?

179
00:16:35,745 --> 00:16:37,998
- YOU'RE DARN TOOTIN' I DO!

180
00:16:38,081 --> 00:16:40,500
AND DO YOU, ZHU LI,
TAKE VARRICK

181
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:42,752
TO BE YOUR
LAWFULLY WEDDED HUSBAND?

182
00:16:42,836 --> 00:16:45,505
DO YOU PROMISE TO CARE FOR HIM
IN SICKNESS AND IN HEALTH,

183
00:16:45,588 --> 00:16:46,673
AND...

184
00:16:46,756 --> 00:16:49,426
AND ALSO SCRUB HIS CALLUSES
ON A BI-WEEKLY BASIS,

185
00:16:49,509 --> 00:16:50,969
WHICH ISN'T REALLY THAT MUCH TO ASK.-

186
00:16:51,052 --> 00:16:52,679
OKAY, I'M NOT READING ALL THIS.

187
00:16:52,762 --> 00:16:54,389
- I DO TAKE VARRICK,

188
00:16:54,472 --> 00:16:55,890
CALLUSES AND ALL.

189
00:16:56,307 --> 00:17:00,145
- YOU MAY NOW DO THE THING.

190
00:17:00,603 --> 00:17:02,022
- OH!

191
00:17:13,908 --> 00:17:15,035
- ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

192
00:17:15,118 --> 00:17:17,912
YOU JUST MAKE ME
SO DANG HAPPY.

193
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:54,032
MY COUSIN TOLD ME
HOW LEVEL-HEADED YOU WERE

194
00:17:54,115 --> 00:17:55,784
DURING THE WHOLE EVACUATION.

195
00:17:55,867 --> 00:17:57,911
I GOT TO ADMIT, I'M IMPRESSED.

196
00:17:57,994 --> 00:18:00,246
I THINK YOU'RE GONNA MAKE
A GREAT LEADER,

197
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:02,874
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN
I'M GONNA SET YOU UP WITH KORRA,

198
00:18:02,957 --> 00:18:04,167
SO DON'T ASK.

199
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:05,919
- THAT'S OKAY, MAKO.

200
00:18:06,002 --> 00:18:09,214
SOMETIMES, A GOOD EVACUATION
IS ITS OWN REWARD.

201
00:18:09,297 --> 00:18:13,176
GOOD TO SEE YOU, PRINCE WU...
OR SHOULD I SAY KING WU?

202
00:18:13,259 --> 00:18:14,761
YOU READY TO GET BACK TO BA SING SE

203
00:18:14,844 --> 00:18:16,012
AND FINALLY TAKE THE THRONE?

204
00:18:16,096 --> 00:18:17,931
- YEAH... ABOUT THAT.

205
00:18:18,014 --> 00:18:20,600
I WAS ACTUALLY THINKING
OF STEPPING DOWN AS KING

206
00:18:20,683 --> 00:18:22,852
AND GETTING RID OF
THE MONARCHY ALTOGETHER.

207
00:18:23,394 --> 00:18:24,979
- ARE YOU JOKING?

208
00:18:25,063 --> 00:18:26,606
- FOR ONCE, I'M NOT.

209
00:18:26,689 --> 00:18:28,441
NOW, I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GONNA SAY:

210
00:18:28,525 --> 00:18:31,486
I'M BEING LAZY,
I'M AFRAID OF RESPONSIBILITY,

211
00:18:31,569 --> 00:18:33,947
I'M PUTTING MY SINGING CAREER
BEFORE MY PEOPLE,

212
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:35,782
BUT IT'S NONE OF THOSE THINGS.

213
00:18:35,865 --> 00:18:38,368
I REALLY THINK THE EARTH
KINGDOM WOULD BE BETTER OFF

214
00:18:38,451 --> 00:18:41,329
IF THE STATES WERE INDEPENDENT
AND HAD ELECTED LEADERS

215
00:18:41,412 --> 00:18:43,081
LIKE THE UNITED REPUBLIC.

216
00:18:43,164 --> 00:18:46,334
THAT'S ACTUALLY PRETTY WISE
AND MATURE OF YOU.

217
00:18:46,417 --> 00:18:48,086
- I THINK IT'S A GREAT IDEA.

218
00:18:48,169 --> 00:18:50,004
THE EARTH KINGDOM SHOULD EVOLVE,

219
00:18:50,088 --> 00:18:51,464
AND I'LL DO EVERYTHING IN MY POWER

220
00:18:51,548 --> 00:18:52,715
TO HELP YOU MAKE THAT HAPPEN.

221
00:18:52,924 --> 00:18:54,801
LOOKING FORWARD
TO WORKING WITH YOU,

222
00:18:54,884 --> 00:18:57,554
BUT FOR NOW, THE DANCE FLOOR CALLS!

223
00:19:02,225 --> 00:19:04,561
- HOW'S THE ARM?
- MUCH BETTER.

224
00:19:04,894 --> 00:19:06,187
- THE WORDS "THANK YOU"

225
00:19:06,271 --> 00:19:08,106
DON'T FEEL BIG ENOUGH
FOR WHAT YOU DID,

226
00:19:08,189 --> 00:19:10,066
BUT I HONESTLY DON'T KNOW
WHAT ELSE TO SAY.

227
00:19:10,358 --> 00:19:12,318
YOU DON'T NEED
TO SAY ANYTHING.

228
00:19:12,610 --> 00:19:15,488
I WANT YOU TO KNOW
I'LL FOLLOW YOU INTO BATTLE

229
00:19:15,572 --> 00:19:17,699
NO MATTER HOW CRAZY THINGS GET.

230
00:19:17,782 --> 00:19:21,369
I'VE GOT YOUR BACK AND I ALWAYS WILL.

231
00:19:31,296 --> 00:19:33,381
- I SPOKE TO PRESIDENT RAIKO.

232
00:19:33,464 --> 00:19:36,217
TOMORROW, HE'S ANNOUNCING
A PLAN TO EXPAND THE CITY

233
00:19:36,301 --> 00:19:38,136
RATHER THAN REBUILD DOWNTOWN.

234
00:19:38,219 --> 00:19:40,263
I BET AANG
NEVER COULD'VE IMAGINED

235
00:19:40,346 --> 00:19:43,600
THERE'D BE A SPIRIT PORTAL
RIGHT IN THE HEART OF REPUBLIC CITY.

236
00:19:43,683 --> 00:19:47,020
KORRA, YOU'VE TRANSFORMED
THE WORLD MORE IN A FEW YEARS

237
00:19:47,103 --> 00:19:50,023
THAN MOST AVATARS DID
DURING THEIR LIFETIMES.

238
00:19:50,106 --> 00:19:53,193
BUT I FEEL
LIKE I'VE ONLY JUST BEGUN.

239
00:19:53,276 --> 00:19:55,945
THERE'S SO MUCH MORE
I WANT TO LEARN AND DO.

240
00:19:56,362 --> 00:19:57,989
YOU DON'T KNOW
HOW HAPPY I AM

241
00:19:58,072 --> 00:19:59,866
TO HEAR YOU SO FULL OF HOPE AGAIN.

242
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,452
IT'S BEEN A BIT
OF A BUMPY RIDE, HUH?

243
00:20:02,535 --> 00:20:06,789
I'VE COME TO REALIZE
LIFE IS ONE BIG BUMPY RIDE.

244
00:20:08,791 --> 00:20:12,086
I KNOW I WAS IN A PRETTY DARK
PLACE AFTER I WAS POISONED,

245
00:20:12,170 --> 00:20:16,132
BUT I FINALLY UNDERSTAND WHY
I HAD TO GO THROUGH ALL THAT.

246
00:20:16,216 --> 00:20:19,052
I NEEDED TO UNDERSTAND
WHAT TRUE SUFFERING WAS

247
00:20:19,135 --> 00:20:22,472
SO I COULD BECOME
MORE COMPASSIONATE TO OTHERS,

248
00:20:22,555 --> 00:20:24,307
EVEN TO PEOPLE LIKE KUVIRA.

249
00:20:29,896 --> 00:20:30,939
- Asami: EXCUSE ME, TENZIN.

250
00:20:31,147 --> 00:20:33,316
VARRICK IS LOOKING FOR YOU.

251
00:20:33,399 --> 00:20:36,402
SOMETHING ABOUT WANTING TO BORROW
A GLIDER SUIT TO FLY OFF THE TOWER.

252
00:20:36,486 --> 00:20:38,321
THAT DOESN'T SEEM
LIKE A GOOD IDEA.

253
00:20:39,572 --> 00:20:41,241
WANT TO SIT WITH ME
FOR A MINUTE?

254
00:20:41,324 --> 00:20:43,326
I'M NOT READY TO GET BACK
TO THE PARTY JUST YET.

255
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:51,751
I DON'T THINK I EVER
REALLY APOLOGIZED.

256
00:20:51,834 --> 00:20:55,171
- FOR WHAT?
- FOR BEING GONE ALL THAT TIME.

257
00:20:55,255 --> 00:20:56,506
FOR NOT COMING BACK SOONER.

258
00:20:57,465 --> 00:21:00,093
YOU DON'T NEED
TO APOLOGIZE FOR ANYTHING.

259
00:21:00,176 --> 00:21:02,637
I'M JUST SO HAPPY YOU'RE HERE NOW.

260
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,180
I DON'T THINK I COULD HAVE HANDLED

261
00:21:04,264 --> 00:21:07,267
LOSING YOU AND MY FATHER
IN THE SAME DAY.

262
00:21:08,059 --> 00:21:11,437
I AM SO SORRY
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED.

263
00:21:11,521 --> 00:21:12,647
- THANK YOU.

264
00:21:12,897 --> 00:21:15,400
I'M JUST GLAD
I WAS ABLE TO FORGIVE HIM.

265
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:20,446
SO WHAT NOW?
BACK TO THE DANCE FLOOR?

266
00:21:20,530 --> 00:21:22,240
- I'M KIND OF ALL DANCED OUT.

267
00:21:22,532 --> 00:21:24,450
HONESTLY, AFTER
EVERYTHING THAT'S HAPPENED

268
00:21:24,534 --> 00:21:27,495
THE PAST FEW MONTHS,
I COULD USE A VACATION.

269
00:21:28,454 --> 00:21:29,789
- LET'S DO IT.

270
00:21:29,872 --> 00:21:31,791
LET'S GO ON A VACATION,
JUST THE TWO OF US,

271
00:21:31,874 --> 00:21:33,251
ANYWHERE YOU WANT.

272
00:21:33,501 --> 00:21:34,585
- REALLY?

273
00:21:34,669 --> 00:21:36,296
OKAY.

274
00:21:36,379 --> 00:21:39,507
I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO SEE
WHAT THE SPIRIT WORLD'S LIKE.

275
00:21:39,716 --> 00:21:42,218
- SOUNDS PERFECT.
