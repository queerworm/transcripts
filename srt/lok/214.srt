1
00:00:07,547 --> 00:00:09,548
Earth.

2
00:00:09,549 --> 00:00:11,049
Fire.

3
00:00:11,050 --> 00:00:13,051
Air.

4
00:00:13,052 --> 00:00:15,153
Water.

5
00:00:15,154 --> 00:00:18,957
Only the Avatar can master
all four elements

6
00:00:18,958 --> 00:00:21,259
and bring balance to the world.

7
00:00:27,166 --> 00:00:30,335
- After fusing with Vaatu,
Unalaq became a Dark Avatar

8
00:00:30,336 --> 00:00:32,370
and ripped Korra and Raava apart.

9
00:00:32,371 --> 00:00:33,805
By destroying Raava,

10
00:00:33,806 --> 00:00:35,474
Unalaq and Vaatu transformed

11
00:00:35,475 --> 00:00:38,043
into the most powerful
dark spirit that's ever lived.

12
00:00:38,044 --> 00:00:41,113
Tenzin managed to free Jinora
from the Fog of Lost Souls,

13
00:00:41,114 --> 00:00:43,849
but her spiritual quest isn't over yet.

14
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:48,850
Can anyone save the world
from eternal darkness?

15
00:00:58,297 --> 00:01:00,766
- Ooh.

16
00:01:00,767 --> 00:01:02,234
Pretty.

17
00:01:02,235 --> 00:01:04,402
- General lroh,
are your ships in position?

18
00:01:04,403 --> 00:01:06,238
- Yes, Mr. President, but I need to know

19
00:01:06,239 --> 00:01:11,239
what kind of enemy we're dealing with.

20
00:01:18,384 --> 00:01:23,384
- It's time to take back
the physical world.

21
00:01:28,528 --> 00:01:33,528
- Fire!

22
00:01:55,054 --> 00:02:00,054
- Monster attack!

23
00:02:10,469 --> 00:02:12,470
- They're over here!

24
00:02:12,471 --> 00:02:16,041
Please, wake up.

25
00:02:16,042 --> 00:02:17,909
- They're going to be all right,

26
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:22,910
but I need to get them
into some spirit water right away.

27
00:02:48,307 --> 00:02:50,342
- Thank goodness you're all okay.

28
00:02:50,343 --> 00:02:52,143
- Did you find Jinora?

29
00:02:52,144 --> 00:02:54,179
- I was able to rescue her soul,

30
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:56,648
but she wasn't ready
to return to her body yet.

31
00:02:56,649 --> 00:02:59,517
She sensed the world
was in grave danger.

32
00:02:59,518 --> 00:03:02,654
- She was right.

33
00:03:02,655 --> 00:03:05,056
- Were you able
to stop Unalaq and Vaatu?

34
00:03:05,057 --> 00:03:09,561
- No, they fused, then Vaatu
ripped Raava right out of me

35
00:03:09,562 --> 00:03:11,396
and destroyed her.

36
00:03:11,397 --> 00:03:12,931
Vaatu won.

37
00:03:12,932 --> 00:03:15,333
- No!
I'm too young

38
00:03:15,334 --> 00:03:17,636
to live through
10,000 years of darkness.

39
00:03:17,637 --> 00:03:20,805
Korra, can't you talk to one
of your past lives or something?

40
00:03:20,806 --> 00:03:23,275
- When Vaatu destroyed Raava,

41
00:03:23,276 --> 00:03:26,878
he destroyed my connection
to the past Avatars too.

42
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:28,313
- If that's true, then--

43
00:03:28,314 --> 00:03:30,782
- The cycle is over.

44
00:03:30,783 --> 00:03:33,285
I'm the last Avatar.

45
00:03:33,286 --> 00:03:36,321
I'm so sorry, Tenzin.

46
00:03:43,462 --> 00:03:48,462
- She needs you now, more than ever.

47
00:03:55,174 --> 00:04:00,174
- It's going to destroy the entire city.

48
00:04:13,092 --> 00:04:18,092
- We're going down.

49
00:04:50,429 --> 00:04:52,697
- It's pandemonium in the streets.

50
00:04:52,698 --> 00:04:55,200
Giant vines are destroying everything.

51
00:04:55,201 --> 00:04:57,836
This is Shiro Shinobi signing off--

52
00:05:07,646 --> 00:05:12,646
- Zhu Li, commence operation
"Winged Freedom"!

53
00:05:16,122 --> 00:05:21,122
Do the thing!

54
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:28,466
- The other Avatars may not
be able to help you anymore,

55
00:05:28,467 --> 00:05:30,068
but perhaps I can.

56
00:05:30,069 --> 00:05:33,138
- No one can help me now.

57
00:05:33,139 --> 00:05:36,174
- I know I haven't been
the best mentor to you,

58
00:05:36,175 --> 00:05:37,575
but I realized it was because

59
00:05:37,576 --> 00:05:40,512
I had a lot of spiritual growth
to do myself.

60
00:05:40,513 --> 00:05:43,581
There may still be a way
for you to stop Vaatu.

61
00:05:43,582 --> 00:05:46,184
- How?
- Let go of your attachment

62
00:05:46,185 --> 00:05:48,019
to who you think you are

63
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:50,155
and connect with your inner spirit.

64
00:05:50,156 --> 00:05:53,058
- Haven't you heard anything I said?

65
00:05:53,059 --> 00:05:54,526
Raava is gone.

66
00:05:54,527 --> 00:05:56,961
I'm not connected to a spirit anymore.

67
00:05:56,962 --> 00:05:58,897
- I'm not talking about Raava.

68
00:05:58,898 --> 00:06:02,067
Raava is not who you are.

69
00:06:02,068 --> 00:06:03,101
Come with me.

70
00:06:03,102 --> 00:06:07,972
I need to show you something.

71
00:06:07,973 --> 00:06:10,341
- Why are you showing me
Vaatu's prison?

72
00:06:10,342 --> 00:06:12,477
- Because this tree had a history

73
00:06:12,478 --> 00:06:14,879
long before it held Vaatu.

74
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:17,782
This is the Tree of Time,

75
00:06:17,783 --> 00:06:19,851
and the legends say that its roots

76
00:06:19,852 --> 00:06:24,122
bind the spirit and physical
worlds together.

77
00:06:24,123 --> 00:06:27,492
- And you think this tree
can help me somehow?

78
00:06:27,493 --> 00:06:29,761
- Yes, I have read that long ago,

79
00:06:29,762 --> 00:06:32,464
the ancients would meditate
beneath this tree

80
00:06:32,465 --> 00:06:37,465
and connect with the great
cosmic energy of the universe.

81
00:06:44,076 --> 00:06:47,112
- These are my memories.

82
00:06:47,113 --> 00:06:49,614
- The Tree of Time remembers all.

83
00:06:49,615 --> 00:06:52,150
Korra, the most powerful thing
about you

84
00:06:52,151 --> 00:06:55,920
is not the spirit of Raava,
but your own inner spirit.

85
00:06:55,921 --> 00:06:59,891
You have always been strong,
unyielding, and fearless.

86
00:06:59,892 --> 00:07:01,793
- Avatar Wan.

87
00:07:01,794 --> 00:07:06,231
- Before he fused with Raava,
Wan was just a regular person.

88
00:07:06,232 --> 00:07:09,567
- But he was brave and smart

89
00:07:09,568 --> 00:07:12,137
and always wanted
to defend the helpless.

90
00:07:12,138 --> 00:07:13,338
- That's right.

91
00:07:13,339 --> 00:07:15,840
He became a legend
because of who he was,

92
00:07:15,841 --> 00:07:18,109
not what he was.

93
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:23,110
He wasn't defined by Raava
any more than you are.

94
00:07:27,486 --> 00:07:29,921
Everyone in Republic City is in danger.

95
00:07:29,922 --> 00:07:32,423
- You have to help them, Korra.
- How?

96
00:07:32,424 --> 00:07:34,058
They're halfway around the world.

97
00:07:34,059 --> 00:07:36,427
- Do as the ancients once did.

98
00:07:36,428 --> 00:07:39,330
Connect to the cosmic energy
of the universe.

99
00:07:39,331 --> 00:07:44,331
Don't bend the elements,
but the energy within yourself.

100
00:07:44,537 --> 00:07:47,705
- You really think I can do this?

101
00:07:47,706 --> 00:07:52,043
- I have no doubt.

102
00:07:52,044 --> 00:07:54,145
- Thank you
for not giving up on me.

103
00:07:54,146 --> 00:07:59,146
- I'm proud of you.

104
00:08:07,393 --> 00:08:10,228
- If you and Vaatu have
the same fight every 10,000 years,

105
00:08:10,229 --> 00:08:12,397
why hasn't one of you
destroyed the other?

106
00:08:12,398 --> 00:08:14,098
- He cannot destroy light

107
00:08:14,099 --> 00:08:16,501
any more
than I can destroy darkness.

108
00:08:16,502 --> 00:08:19,871
One cannot exist without the other.

109
00:08:19,872 --> 00:08:24,872
- Find the light in the dark.

110
00:09:19,531 --> 00:09:24,531
- Uh...what did you say to her, exactly?

111
00:09:56,335 --> 00:09:57,969
- Korra's back.

112
00:09:57,970 --> 00:10:02,970
- And she's a blue giant.

113
00:11:06,071 --> 00:11:10,007
- You are looking
for something that is gone.

114
00:11:10,008 --> 00:11:12,744
Raava has been destroyed.

115
00:11:12,745 --> 00:11:17,745
And soon you will be too!

116
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:36,230
- They're coming for Korra.

117
00:12:35,627 --> 00:12:37,728
- Leave my Bolin alone!

118
00:12:37,729 --> 00:12:40,198
- I am so done with spirits.

119
00:12:40,199 --> 00:12:41,833
- Eska!

120
00:12:41,834 --> 00:12:42,900
I love you!

121
00:12:45,404 --> 00:12:48,072
Let's face the end
of the world together!

122
00:12:48,073 --> 00:12:53,073
- You're so romantic.

123
00:12:55,881 --> 00:12:58,583
- With you out of the way,

124
00:12:58,584 --> 00:13:03,584
I will be the one true Avatar.

125
00:13:11,163 --> 00:13:12,930
- Mommy, it's Jinora.

126
00:13:12,931 --> 00:13:15,299
She's...beautiful.

127
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:17,668
- What?
Let me see.

128
00:13:18,871 --> 00:13:23,871
Be careful, sweetie!

129
00:13:42,127 --> 00:13:46,330
- No!

130
00:13:46,331 --> 00:13:51,331
- Raava.

131
00:14:47,492 --> 00:14:50,127
- Go in peace.

132
00:14:50,128 --> 00:14:52,897
- Harmonic convergence
is nearly over.

133
00:14:52,898 --> 00:14:57,898
We must return to the spirit
world so we can fuse once again.

134
00:16:00,298 --> 00:16:05,298
- I'll see you soon, Dad.

135
00:16:23,355 --> 00:16:27,725
Gran-Gran, I missed you.

136
00:16:27,726 --> 00:16:29,794
- What about Korra and the others?

137
00:16:29,795 --> 00:16:31,062
- Don't worry.

138
00:16:31,063 --> 00:16:32,496
They're all right.

139
00:16:32,497 --> 00:16:37,497
Korra saved the world.

140
00:17:29,755 --> 00:17:34,755
- Her Avatar spirit has returned.

141
00:17:44,870 --> 00:17:49,870
- It's over.

142
00:17:59,985 --> 00:18:02,887
I don't even know what to say.

143
00:18:02,888 --> 00:18:03,921
- You were amazing.

144
00:18:03,922 --> 00:18:06,757
- And the way you turned
all gigantic like that, wow!

145
00:18:06,758 --> 00:18:08,592
I just wish Varrick
had been here to film it.

146
00:18:08,593 --> 00:18:10,694
It would have been
the greatest mover ever.

147
00:18:10,695 --> 00:18:15,695
After "The Nuktuk Chronicles,"
of course.

148
00:18:16,334 --> 00:18:17,935
- I'm sorry about your father,

149
00:18:17,936 --> 00:18:20,905
but he was already fused with Vaatu.

150
00:18:20,906 --> 00:18:22,239
I couldn't save him.

151
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:25,009
- It seems cousin Korra
is under the impression

152
00:18:25,010 --> 00:18:27,611
we are saddened
by our father's demise.

153
00:18:27,612 --> 00:18:29,346
- But I will not miss him at all.

154
00:18:29,347 --> 00:18:32,349
In the end,
he became a deplorable man.

155
00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:33,751
- Agreed.

156
00:18:33,752 --> 00:18:36,954
But how will we explain this to mother?

157
00:18:36,955 --> 00:18:39,023
- So I was thinking,
I'm not really a fan

158
00:18:39,024 --> 00:18:41,358
of the long-distance
relationship thing.

159
00:18:41,359 --> 00:18:44,061
So how about you move
to Republic City with me?

160
00:18:44,062 --> 00:18:46,664
- I do not think that will be possible.

161
00:18:46,665 --> 00:18:49,967
- Okay, Desna can come too.

162
00:18:49,968 --> 00:18:52,102
- I will not be joining you, Bolin.

163
00:18:52,103 --> 00:18:54,405
Desna and I must return home.

164
00:18:54,406 --> 00:18:57,842
- But you said--
- Eternal darkness was upon us.

165
00:18:57,843 --> 00:19:00,845
I became caught up in the moment.

166
00:19:00,846 --> 00:19:02,780
- Yeah.

167
00:19:02,781 --> 00:19:04,748
I guess I did too.

168
00:19:04,749 --> 00:19:07,885
- But... you will always
hold a special place

169
00:19:07,886 --> 00:19:10,788
in the organ that pumps my blood.

170
00:19:10,789 --> 00:19:14,725
I will remember you fondly,
my turtle-duck.

171
00:19:18,597 --> 00:19:20,831
Bum-Ju, you're okay.

172
00:19:20,832 --> 00:19:25,832
I missed you, little buddy.

173
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:31,442
- Now that you're bonded
with Raava once again,

174
00:19:31,443 --> 00:19:35,813
are you also reconnected
to your past lives?

175
00:19:35,814 --> 00:19:37,414
- No.

176
00:19:37,415 --> 00:19:39,850
I think that link is gone forever.

177
00:19:39,851 --> 00:19:42,386
- I see.

178
00:19:42,387 --> 00:19:47,387
Why don't you close the portals
and we'll go home.

179
00:19:53,164 --> 00:19:55,432
- Maybe I shouldn't.

180
00:19:55,433 --> 00:19:56,934
- What do you mean?

181
00:19:56,935 --> 00:19:59,270
- What if Unalaq was right

182
00:19:59,271 --> 00:20:01,405
when he said
the Avatar shouldn't be a bridge

183
00:20:01,406 --> 00:20:03,641
between the two worlds?

184
00:20:03,642 --> 00:20:05,709
What if Avatar Wan made a mistake

185
00:20:05,710 --> 00:20:08,112
when he closed the portals?

186
00:20:08,113 --> 00:20:09,546
What if humans and spirits

187
00:20:09,547 --> 00:20:13,217
weren't meant to live apart?

188
00:20:13,218 --> 00:20:16,520
Well, what do you think I should do?

189
00:20:16,521 --> 00:20:19,223
- I think you should trust
your instincts.

190
00:20:19,224 --> 00:20:21,558
There is nothing else I can teach you.

191
00:20:21,559 --> 00:20:24,695
You are the Avatar.

192
00:20:24,696 --> 00:20:29,696
Whatever your decision,
I support you.

193
00:20:41,713 --> 00:20:45,582
- Hey, can we talk?
- Of course.

194
00:20:45,583 --> 00:20:46,951
- There's something
I've been wanting to tell you

195
00:20:46,952 --> 00:20:48,352
about that fight we had.

196
00:20:48,353 --> 00:20:50,154
I know I said it wasn't that bad,

197
00:20:50,155 --> 00:20:53,324
but that's not exactly true.

198
00:20:53,325 --> 00:20:57,261
I, um--I broke up with you.

199
00:20:57,262 --> 00:20:58,529
- I remember.

200
00:20:58,530 --> 00:21:01,832
- But I thought you said you lost
part of your memory?

201
00:21:01,833 --> 00:21:03,867
- I did, but being inside
the Tree of Time

202
00:21:03,868 --> 00:21:06,170
brought it back.

203
00:21:06,171 --> 00:21:08,072
I'm sorry for blowing up at you.

204
00:21:08,073 --> 00:21:09,707
- That's okay.

205
00:21:09,708 --> 00:21:11,742
I think we both said
some things that we regret.

206
00:21:11,743 --> 00:21:14,211
- Why didn't you just tell me
the truth in the first place?

207
00:21:14,212 --> 00:21:15,479
- I know I should have,

208
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:18,916
but I didn't wanna hurt you
all over again.

209
00:21:18,917 --> 00:21:21,518
I guess part of me wanted
to forget about the breakup too.

210
00:21:21,519 --> 00:21:24,822
- I think we both know that this...

211
00:21:24,823 --> 00:21:28,258
us... doesn't work.

212
00:21:28,259 --> 00:21:30,394
- You're right.

213
00:21:30,395 --> 00:21:31,962
- It's over.

214
00:21:31,963 --> 00:21:36,963
For real this time.

215
00:21:46,344 --> 00:21:47,778
- I'll always love you, Korra.

216
00:21:47,779 --> 00:21:52,779
- And I'll always love you.

217
00:21:57,589 --> 00:22:01,692
- You want a hug?

218
00:22:01,693 --> 00:22:05,963
Hmmm.

219
00:22:05,964 --> 00:22:08,966
- The War of the Water Tribes is over.

220
00:22:08,967 --> 00:22:11,035
Unalaq has been defeated

221
00:22:11,036 --> 00:22:13,604
and the Northern fleet
is returning home.

222
00:22:13,605 --> 00:22:16,573
The Water Tribes
will always be allies,

223
00:22:16,574 --> 00:22:19,810
but the Southern Tribe
is now independent.

224
00:22:19,811 --> 00:22:21,378
And the Southern Council

225
00:22:21,379 --> 00:22:24,882
of Elders has appointed
my father, Tonraq,

226
00:22:24,883 --> 00:22:29,883
to be your new chief.
[cheers and applause]

227
00:22:30,088 --> 00:22:32,790
I've realized that even though
we should learn

228
00:22:32,791 --> 00:22:34,825
from those who came before us,

229
00:22:34,826 --> 00:22:38,695
we must also forge our own path.

230
00:22:38,696 --> 00:22:42,866
So that is why I've decided
to keep the portals open.

231
00:22:42,867 --> 00:22:45,769
Humans can now physically
enter the spirit world

232
00:22:45,770 --> 00:22:49,173
and spirits will
be free to roam our world.

233
00:22:49,174 --> 00:22:52,042
I will no longer be the bridge.

234
00:22:52,043 --> 00:22:56,180
Humans and spirits
must learn to live together.

235
00:22:56,181 --> 00:22:59,883
My mission will always be
to use Raava's light spirit

236
00:22:59,884 --> 00:23:03,287
to guide the world
toward peace and balance.

237
00:23:03,288 --> 00:23:06,757
Harmonic convergence has caused
a shift in the planet's energy.

238
00:23:06,758 --> 00:23:08,859
I can feel it.

239
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:11,662
Things will never be the same again.

240
00:23:11,663 --> 00:23:16,166
We are entering a new age.
