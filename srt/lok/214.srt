1
00:00:07,583 --> 00:00:08,500
- EARTH.

2
00:00:08,542 --> 00:00:10,583
FIRE.

3
00:00:10,625 --> 00:00:12,041
AIR.

4
00:00:12,083 --> 00:00:14,709
WATER.

5
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:18,542
ONLY THE AVATAR
CAN MASTER ALL FOUR ELEMENTS

6
00:00:18,583 --> 00:00:21,250
AND BRING BALANCE TO THE WORLD.

7
00:00:27,208 --> 00:00:29,667
- AFTER FUSING WITH VAATU,
UNALAQ BECAME A DARK AVATAR

8
00:00:29,709 --> 00:00:31,709
AND RIPPED KORRA
AND RAAVA APART.

9
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:33,000
BY DESTROYING RAAVA,

10
00:00:33,041 --> 00:00:34,834
UNALAQ AND VAATU TRANSFORMED

11
00:00:34,875 --> 00:00:37,542
INTO THE MOST POWERFUL
DARK SPIRIT THAT'S EVER LIVED.

12
00:00:37,583 --> 00:00:40,375
TENZIN MANAGED TO FREE JINORA
FROM THE FOG OF LOST SOULS,

13
00:00:40,417 --> 00:00:43,291
BUT HER SPIRITUAL QUEST
ISN'T OVER YET.

14
00:00:43,333 --> 00:00:47,000
CAN ANYONE SAVE THE WORLD FROM
ETERNAL DARKNESS?

15
00:00:58,166 --> 00:00:59,959
- OOH.

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,250
PRETTY.

17
00:01:02,291 --> 00:01:04,250
- GENERAL IROH,
ARE YOUR SHIPS IN POSITION?

18
00:01:04,291 --> 00:01:06,041
- YES, MR. PRESIDENT,
BUT I NEED TO KNOW

19
00:01:06,083 --> 00:01:08,750
WHAT KIND OF ENEMY
WE'RE DEALING WITH.

20
00:01:18,291 --> 00:01:21,959
- IT'S TIME TO TAKE BACK
THE PHYSICAL WORLD.

21
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:31,125
- FIRE!

22
00:01:46,625 --> 00:01:49,542
[screaming]

23
00:01:54,792 --> 00:01:57,166
- MONSTER ATTACK!

24
00:02:10,166 --> 00:02:11,166
- THEY'RE OVER HERE!

25
00:02:11,208 --> 00:02:14,125
PLEASE, WAKE UP.

26
00:02:15,792 --> 00:02:17,834
- THEY'RE GOING TO BE
ALL RIGHT,

27
00:02:17,875 --> 00:02:21,542
BUT I NEED TO GET THEM INTO
SOME SPIRIT WATER RIGHT AWAY.

28
00:02:44,583 --> 00:02:46,291
- [gasps]

29
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:48,041
[all breathing deeply]

30
00:02:48,083 --> 00:02:50,083
- THANK GOODNESS
YOU'RE ALL OKAY.

31
00:02:50,125 --> 00:02:51,834
- DID YOU FIND JINORA?

32
00:02:51,875 --> 00:02:54,125
- I WAS ABLE TO RESCUE HER SOUL,

33
00:02:54,166 --> 00:02:56,458
BUT SHE WASN'T READY
TO RETURN TO HER BODY YET.

34
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:59,125
SHE SENSE THE WORLD
WAS IN GRAVE DANGER.

35
00:02:59,166 --> 00:03:02,542
- SHE WAS RIGHT.

36
00:03:02,583 --> 00:03:05,041
- WERE YOU ABLE
TO STOP UNALAQ AND VAATU?

37
00:03:05,083 --> 00:03:09,166
- NO, THEY FUSED, THEN VAATU
RIPPED RAAVA RIGHT OUT OF ME

38
00:03:09,208 --> 00:03:11,208
AND DESTROYED HER.

39
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:12,625
VAATU WON.

40
00:03:12,667 --> 00:03:15,125
- NO!
I'M TOO YOUNG

41
00:03:15,166 --> 00:03:17,542
TO LIVE THROUGH 10,000
YEARS OF DARKNESS.

42
00:03:17,583 --> 00:03:19,959
KORRA, CAN'T YOU TALK TO ONE OF
YOUR PAST LIVES OR SOMETHING?

43
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,667
- WHEN VAATU DESTROYED RAAVA,

44
00:03:22,709 --> 00:03:26,083
HE DESTROYED MY CONNECTION
TO THE PAST AVATARS TOO.

45
00:03:26,125 --> 00:03:28,125
- IF THAT'S TRUE, THEN--

46
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:30,458
- THE CYCLE IS OVER.

47
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:33,083
I'M THE LAST AVATAR.

48
00:03:33,125 --> 00:03:36,125
I'M SO SORRY, TENZIN.

49
00:03:36,166 --> 00:03:39,834
[sobbing]

50
00:03:43,333 --> 00:03:46,417
- SHE NEEDS YOU NOW,
MORE THAN EVER.

51
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:58,709
- IT'S GOING TO DESTROY
THE ENTIRE CITY.

52
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:12,917
[sirens blare]

53
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:16,041
[alarm beeps]
- WE'RE GOING DOWN.

54
00:04:30,208 --> 00:04:33,125
[explosion]

55
00:04:50,333 --> 00:04:52,625
- IT'S PANDEMONIUM
IN THE STREETS.

56
00:04:52,667 --> 00:04:55,000
GIANT VINES
ARE DESTROYING EVERYTHING.

57
00:04:55,041 --> 00:04:57,542
THIS IS SHIRO SHINOBI
SIGNING OFF--

58
00:04:57,583 --> 00:04:59,583
[screams]

59
00:05:06,875 --> 00:05:10,542
- ZHU LI, COMMENCE OPERATION
"WINGED FREEDOM!"

60
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,667
DO THE THING!

61
00:05:24,792 --> 00:05:28,417
- THE OTHER AVATARS MAY NOT
BE ABLE TO HELP YOU ANYMORE,

62
00:05:28,458 --> 00:05:29,917
BUT PERHAPS I CAN.

63
00:05:29,959 --> 00:05:32,417
- NO ONE CAN HELP ME NOW.

64
00:05:32,458 --> 00:05:36,041
- I KNOW I HAVEN'T BEEN
THE BEST MENTOR TO YOU,

65
00:05:36,083 --> 00:05:37,542
BUT I REALIZED IT WAS BECAUSE

66
00:05:37,583 --> 00:05:40,458
I HAD A LOT OF SPIRITUAL GROWTH
TO DO MYSELF.

67
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:43,291
THERE MAY STILL BE A WAY
FOR YOU TO STOP VAATU.

68
00:05:43,333 --> 00:05:44,542
- HOW?

69
00:05:44,583 --> 00:05:46,041
- LET GO OF YOUR ATTACHMENT

70
00:05:46,083 --> 00:05:47,834
TO WHO YOU<i> THINK</i> YOU ARE,

71
00:05:47,875 --> 00:05:50,000
AND CONNECT
WITH YOUR INNER SPIRIT.

72
00:05:50,041 --> 00:05:52,000
- HAVEN'T YOU HEARD
ANYTHING I SAID?

73
00:05:52,041 --> 00:05:54,417
RAAVA IS GONE.

74
00:05:54,458 --> 00:05:56,709
I'M NOT CONNECTED
TO A SPIRIT ANYMORE.

75
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:58,625
- I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT RAAVA.

76
00:05:58,667 --> 00:06:01,917
RAAVA IS NOT WHO YOU ARE.

77
00:06:01,959 --> 00:06:02,959
COME WITH ME.

78
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,083
I NEED TO SHOW YOU SOMETHING.

79
00:06:07,875 --> 00:06:10,291
- WHY ARE YOU SHOWING ME
VAATU'S PRISON?

80
00:06:10,333 --> 00:06:12,458
- BECAUSE THIS TREE
HAD A HISTORY

81
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:14,709
LONG BEFORE IT HELD VAATU.

82
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:17,834
THIS IS THE TREE OF TIME.

83
00:06:17,875 --> 00:06:19,917
AND THE LEGENDS
SAY THAT ITS ROOTS

84
00:06:19,959 --> 00:06:24,250
BIND THE SPIRIT AND PHYSICAL
WORLDS TOGETHER.

85
00:06:24,291 --> 00:06:27,250
- AND YOU THINK THIS TREE
CAN HELP ME SOMEHOW?

86
00:06:27,291 --> 00:06:29,792
- YES, I HAVE READ
THAT LONG AGO,

87
00:06:29,834 --> 00:06:32,417
THE ANCIENTS WOULD MEDITATE
BENEATH THIS TREE

88
00:06:32,458 --> 00:06:35,625
AND CONNECT WITH THE GREAT
COSMIC ENERGY OF THE UNIVERSE.

89
00:06:43,959 --> 00:06:46,750
- THESE ARE MY MEMORIES.

90
00:06:46,792 --> 00:06:49,625
- THE TREE OF TIME
REMEMBERS ALL.

91
00:06:49,667 --> 00:06:52,291
KORRA, THE MOST POWERFUL THING
ABOUT YOU

92
00:06:52,333 --> 00:06:56,000
IS NOT THE SPIRIT OF RAAVA,
BUT YOUR OWN INNER SPIRIT.

93
00:06:56,041 --> 00:06:59,792
YOU HAVE ALWAYS BEEN STRONG,
UNYIELDING, AND FEARLESS.

94
00:06:59,834 --> 00:07:01,917
- AVATAR WAN.

95
00:07:01,959 --> 00:07:06,208
- BEFORE HE FUSED WITH RAAVA,
WAN WAS JUST A REGULAR PERSON.

96
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:09,625
- BUT HE WAS BRAVE AND SMART

97
00:07:09,667 --> 00:07:12,083
AND ALWAYS WANTED
TO DEFEND THE HELPLESS.

98
00:07:12,125 --> 00:07:13,417
- THAT'S RIGHT.

99
00:07:13,458 --> 00:07:15,709
HE BECAME A LEGEND
BECAUSE OF WHO HE WAS,

100
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:18,291
NOT WHAT HE WAS.

101
00:07:18,333 --> 00:07:21,750
HE WASN'T DEFINED BY RAAVA
ANY MORE THAN YOU ARE.

102
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:25,959
- [gasps]

103
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,083
EVERYONE IN REPUBLIC CITY
IS IN DANGER.

104
00:07:30,125 --> 00:07:32,458
- YOU HAVE TO HELP THEM, KORRA.
- HOW?

105
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:33,959
THEY'RE HALFWAY
AROUND THE WORLD.

106
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,417
- DO AS THE ANCIENTS ONCE DID.

107
00:07:36,458 --> 00:07:39,291
CONNECT TO THE COSMIC ENERGY
OF THE UNIVERSE.

108
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:43,250
DON'T BEND THE ELEMENTS,
BUT THE ENERGY WITHIN YOURSELF.

109
00:07:44,667 --> 00:07:47,500
- YOU REALLY
THINK I CAN DO THIS?

110
00:07:47,542 --> 00:07:49,542
- I HAVE NO DOUBT.

111
00:07:51,959 --> 00:07:54,041
- THANK YOU
FOR NOT GIVING UP ON ME.

112
00:07:54,083 --> 00:07:56,417
- I'M PROUD OF YOU.

113
00:08:06,417 --> 00:08:10,208
- IF YOU AND VAATU HAVE THE SAME
FIGHT EVERY 10,000 YEARS,

114
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:12,458
WHY HASN'T ONE OF YOU
DESTROYED THE OTHER?

115
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:14,083
- HE CANNOT DESTROY LIGHT

116
00:08:14,125 --> 00:08:16,583
ANY MORE
THAN I CAN DESTROY DARKNESS.

117
00:08:16,625 --> 00:08:19,792
ONE CANNOT EXIST
WITHOUT THE OTHER.

118
00:08:19,834 --> 00:08:22,917
- FIND THE LIGHT IN THE DARK.

119
00:08:59,542 --> 00:09:02,458
[all gasp]

120
00:09:19,667 --> 00:09:22,625
- UH...WHAT DID YOU SAY TO HER,
EXACTLY?

121
00:09:29,375 --> 00:09:32,041
[sirens blare]

122
00:09:37,291 --> 00:09:39,959
[air hisses]

123
00:09:55,875 --> 00:09:57,625
- KORRA'S BACK.

124
00:09:57,667 --> 00:09:59,875
- AND SHE'S A BLUE GIANT.

125
00:11:05,834 --> 00:11:09,709
- YOU ARE LOOKING
FOR SOMETHING THAT IS GONE.

126
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:12,375
RAAVA HAS BEEN DESTROYED.

127
00:11:12,417 --> 00:11:15,500
AND SOON YOU WILL BE TOO!

128
00:11:28,041 --> 00:11:30,208
[spirits hiss]

129
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:32,917
- THEY'RE COMING FOR KORRA.

130
00:12:23,875 --> 00:12:25,500
- [screams]

131
00:12:25,542 --> 00:12:27,458
[grunts]

132
00:12:30,792 --> 00:12:32,709
[yelps]

133
00:12:35,291 --> 00:12:37,375
- LEAVE MY BOLIN ALONE!

134
00:12:37,417 --> 00:12:39,709
- I AM SO DONE WITH SPIRITS.

135
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:41,500
- ESKA!

136
00:12:41,542 --> 00:12:42,333
I LOVE YOU!

137
00:12:42,375 --> 00:12:44,959
MWAH!

138
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,333
LET'S FACE THE END
OF THE WORLD TOGETHER!

139
00:12:47,375 --> 00:12:50,375
- YOU'RE SO ROMANTIC.

140
00:12:55,583 --> 00:12:58,166
- WITH YOU OUT OF THE WAY,

141
00:12:58,208 --> 00:13:02,375
I WILL BE THE ONE TRUE AVATAR.

142
00:13:10,792 --> 00:13:12,500
- MOMMY, IT'S JINORA.

143
00:13:12,542 --> 00:13:14,917
SHE'S...BEAUTIFUL.

144
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:17,375
- WHAT?
LET ME SEE.

145
00:13:17,417 --> 00:13:18,667
[gasps]

146
00:13:18,709 --> 00:13:21,625
BE CAREFUL, SWEETIE!

147
00:13:41,959 --> 00:13:44,625
- NO!
[heart beating]

148
00:13:45,959 --> 00:13:47,875
- RAAVA.

149
00:13:55,291 --> 00:13:57,959
[heart beating]

150
00:14:26,083 --> 00:14:31,000
- [screams]

151
00:14:47,208 --> 00:14:49,333
- GO IN PEACE.

152
00:14:49,375 --> 00:14:52,667
- HARMONIC CONVERGENCE
IS NEARLY OVER.

153
00:14:52,709 --> 00:14:56,375
WE MUST RETURN TO THE SPIRIT
WORLD SO WE CAN FUSE ONCE AGAIN.

154
00:15:09,709 --> 00:15:11,625
- [grunts]

155
00:15:15,333 --> 00:15:17,000
- [grunts]

156
00:16:00,083 --> 00:16:03,000
- I'LL SEE YOU SOON, DAD.

157
00:16:23,125 --> 00:16:26,041
GRAN-GRAN, I MISSED YOU.

158
00:16:27,583 --> 00:16:29,625
- WHAT ABOUT KORRA
AND THE OTHERS?

159
00:16:29,667 --> 00:16:30,959
- DON'T WORRY.

160
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,250
THEY'RE ALL RIGHT.

161
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:34,375
KORRA SAVED THE WORLD.

162
00:17:29,667 --> 00:17:32,208
- HER AVATAR SPIRIT
HAS RETURNED.

163
00:17:44,792 --> 00:17:46,458
- IT'S OVER.

164
00:17:53,667 --> 00:17:55,583
- [laughs]

165
00:17:58,125 --> 00:17:59,458
- MWAH.

166
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:01,667
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT TO SAY.

167
00:18:01,709 --> 00:18:03,041
- YOU WERE AMAZING.

168
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:06,041
- AND THE WAY YOU TURNED ALL
GIGANTIC LIKE THAT, WOW!

169
00:18:06,083 --> 00:18:07,834
I JUST WISH VARRICK
HAD BEEN HERE TO FILM IT.

170
00:18:07,875 --> 00:18:09,959
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN
THE GREATEST MOVER EVER.

171
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,250
AFTER<i> THE NUKTUK CHRONICLES,</i>
OF COURSE.

172
00:18:15,542 --> 00:18:17,000
- I'M SORRY ABOUT YOUR FATHER,

173
00:18:17,041 --> 00:18:19,959
BUT HE WAS ALREADY
FUSED WITH VAATU.

174
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,375
I COULDN'T SAVE HIM.

175
00:18:21,417 --> 00:18:24,083
- IT SEEMS COUSIN KORRA
IS UNDER THE IMPRESSION

176
00:18:24,125 --> 00:18:26,583
WE ARE SADDENED
BY OUR FATHER'S DEMISE.

177
00:18:26,625 --> 00:18:28,500
- BUT I WILL NOT
MISS HIM AT ALL.

178
00:18:28,542 --> 00:18:31,250
IN THE END,
HE BECAME A DEPLORABLE MAN.

179
00:18:31,291 --> 00:18:33,166
- AGREED.

180
00:18:33,208 --> 00:18:36,000
BUT HOW WILL WE
EXPLAIN THIS TO MOTHER?

181
00:18:36,041 --> 00:18:38,083
- SO I WAS THINKING,
I'M NOT REALLY A FAN

182
00:18:38,125 --> 00:18:40,500
OF THE LONG-DISTANCE
RELATIONSHIP THING.

183
00:18:40,542 --> 00:18:43,166
SO HOW ABOUT YOU MOVE
TO REPUBLIC CITY WITH ME?

184
00:18:43,208 --> 00:18:45,667
- I DO NOT THINK
THAT WILL BE POSSIBLE.

185
00:18:45,709 --> 00:18:49,041
- OKAY, DESNA CAN COME TOO.

186
00:18:49,083 --> 00:18:51,208
- I WILL NOT BE JOINING YOU,
BOLIN.

187
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:53,583
DESNA AND I MUST RETURN HOME.

188
00:18:53,625 --> 00:18:56,875
- BUT YOU SAID--
- ETERNAL DARKNESS WAS UPON US.

189
00:18:56,917 --> 00:18:59,959
I BECAME CAUGHT UP
IN THE MOMENT.

190
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,875
- YEAH.

191
00:19:01,917 --> 00:19:04,041
I GUESS I DID TOO.

192
00:19:04,083 --> 00:19:06,959
- BUT...YOU WILL ALWAYS
HOLD A SPECIAL PLACE

193
00:19:07,041 --> 00:19:09,834
IN THE ORGAN
THAT PUMPS MY BLOOD.

194
00:19:09,875 --> 00:19:13,750
I WILL REMEMBER YOU FONDLY,
MY TURTLE-DUCK.

195
00:19:13,792 --> 00:19:15,959
- [squeaking]

196
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,583
- [laughs]

197
00:19:17,625 --> 00:19:19,875
BUM-JU, YOU'RE OKAY.

198
00:19:19,917 --> 00:19:22,583
I MISSED YOU, LITTLE BUDDY.

199
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:30,667
- NOW THAT YOU'RE BONDED
WITH RAAVA ONCE AGAIN,

200
00:19:30,709 --> 00:19:34,166
ARE YOU ALSO RECONNECTED
TO YOUR PAST LIVES?

201
00:19:34,208 --> 00:19:36,625
- NO.

202
00:19:36,667 --> 00:19:38,917
I THINK THAT LINK
IS GONE FOREVER.

203
00:19:38,959 --> 00:19:41,333
- I SEE.

204
00:19:41,375 --> 00:19:44,792
WHY DON'T YOU CLOSE THE PORTALS
AND WE'LL GO HOME.

205
00:19:51,834 --> 00:19:53,375
- MAYBE I SHOULDN'T.

206
00:19:53,417 --> 00:19:56,000
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

207
00:19:56,041 --> 00:19:58,417
- WHAT IF UNALAQ WAS RIGHT

208
00:19:58,458 --> 00:20:00,333
WHEN HE SAID THE AVATAR
SHOULDN'T BE A BRIDGE

209
00:20:00,375 --> 00:20:02,875
BETWEEN THE TWO WORLDS?

210
00:20:02,917 --> 00:20:04,709
WHAT IF AVATAR WAN
MADE A MISTAKE

211
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:06,500
WHEN HE CLOSED THE PORTALS?

212
00:20:06,542 --> 00:20:08,792
WHAT IF HUMANS AND SPIRITS

213
00:20:08,834 --> 00:20:12,375
WEREN'T MEANT TO LIVE APART?

214
00:20:12,417 --> 00:20:15,750
WELL, WHAT DO YOU THINK
I SHOULD DO?

215
00:20:15,792 --> 00:20:18,375
- I THINK YOU SHOULD
TRUST YOUR INSTINCTS.

216
00:20:18,417 --> 00:20:20,542
THERE IS NOTHING ELSE
I CAN TEACH YOU.

217
00:20:20,583 --> 00:20:23,875
YOU ARE THE AVATAR.

218
00:20:23,917 --> 00:20:27,166
WHATEVER YOUR DECISION,
I SUPPORT YOU.

219
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,583
- HEY, CAN WE TALK?
- OF COURSE.

220
00:20:44,625 --> 00:20:45,959
- THERE'S SOMETHING
I'VE BEEN WANTING TO TELL YOU

221
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,458
ABOUT THAT FIGHT WE HAD.

222
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:49,250
I KNOW I SAID
IT WASN'T THAT BAD,

223
00:20:49,291 --> 00:20:52,458
BUT THAT'S NOT EXACTLY TRUE.

224
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:55,375
I, UM--I BROKE UP WITH YOU.

225
00:20:55,417 --> 00:20:57,709
- I REMEMBER.

226
00:20:57,750 --> 00:21:00,917
- BUT I THOUGHT YOU SAID YOU
LOST PART OF YOUR MEMORY?

227
00:21:00,959 --> 00:21:02,959
- I DID, BUT BEING INSIDE
THE TREE OF TIME

228
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,333
BROUGHT IT BACK.

229
00:21:05,375 --> 00:21:07,208
I'M SORRY
FOR BLOWING UP AT YOU.

230
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:09,000
- THAT'S OKAY.

231
00:21:09,041 --> 00:21:11,041
I THINK WE BOTH SAID
SOME THINGS THAT WE REGRET.

232
00:21:11,083 --> 00:21:13,417
- WHY DIDN'T YOU JUST TELL ME
THE TRUTH IN THE FIRST PLACE?

233
00:21:13,458 --> 00:21:14,834
- I KNOW I SHOULD HAVE,

234
00:21:14,875 --> 00:21:18,250
BUT I DIDN'T WANNA HURT YOU
ALL OVER AGAIN.

235
00:21:18,291 --> 00:21:20,750
I GUESS PART OF ME WANTED TO
FORGET ABOUT THE BREAKUP TOO.

236
00:21:20,792 --> 00:21:23,875
- I THINK WE BOTH KNOW THAT
THIS...

237
00:21:23,917 --> 00:21:27,417
US...DOESN'T WORK.

238
00:21:27,458 --> 00:21:29,333
- YOU'RE RIGHT.

239
00:21:29,375 --> 00:21:31,083
- IT'S OVER.

240
00:21:31,125 --> 00:21:33,083
FOR REAL THIS TIME.

241
00:21:45,583 --> 00:21:46,834
- I'LL ALWAYS LOVE YOU, KORRA.

242
00:21:46,875 --> 00:21:49,792
- AND I'LL ALWAYS LOVE YOU.

243
00:21:56,625 --> 00:22:00,792
- YOU WANT A HUG?

244
00:22:00,834 --> 00:22:05,125
HMMM.

245
00:22:05,166 --> 00:22:08,125
- THE WAR OF THE WATER TRIBES
IS OVER.

246
00:22:08,166 --> 00:22:10,208
UNALAQ HAS BEEN DEFEATED

247
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:12,959
AND THE NORTHERN FLEET
IS RETURNING HOME.

248
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,917
THE WATER TRIBES
WILL ALWAYS BE ALLIES,

249
00:22:15,959 --> 00:22:18,959
BUT THE SOUTHERN TRIBE
IS NOW INDEPENDENT.

250
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,667
[crowd cheers]
AND THE SOUTHERN COUNCIL

251
00:22:20,709 --> 00:22:24,250
OF ELDERS HAS APPOINTED
MY FATHER, TONRAQ,

252
00:22:24,291 --> 00:22:29,250
TO BE YOUR NEW CHIEF.
[cheers and applause]

253
00:22:29,291 --> 00:22:31,875
I'VE REALIZED THAT EVEN THOUGH
WE SHOULD LEARN

254
00:22:31,917 --> 00:22:33,917
FROM THOSE WHO CAME BEFORE US,

255
00:22:33,959 --> 00:22:37,458
WE MUST ALSO FORGE
OUR OWN PATH.

256
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:42,208
SO THAT IS WHY I'VE DECIDED
TO KEEP THE PORTALS OPEN.

257
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:45,083
HUMANS CAN NOW PHYSICALLY
ENTER THE SPIRIT WORLD

258
00:22:45,125 --> 00:22:48,333
AND SPIRITS WILL
BE FREE TO ROAM OUR WORLD.

259
00:22:48,375 --> 00:22:51,166
I WILL NO LONGER
BE THE BRIDGE.

260
00:22:51,208 --> 00:22:55,375
HUMANS AND SPIRITS
MUST LEARN TO LIVE TOGETHER.

261
00:22:55,417 --> 00:22:59,083
MY MISSION WILL ALWAYS
BE TO USE RAAVA'S LIGHT SPIRIT

262
00:22:59,125 --> 00:23:02,250
TO GUIDE THE WORLD
TOWARD PEACE AND BALANCE.

263
00:23:02,291 --> 00:23:05,917
HARMONIC CONVERGENCE HAS CAUSED
A SHIFT IN THE PLANET'S ENERGY.

264
00:23:05,959 --> 00:23:08,041
I CAN FEEL IT.

265
00:23:08,083 --> 00:23:10,792
THINGS WILL NEVER
BE THE SAME AGAIN.

266
00:23:10,834 --> 00:23:16,000
WE ARE ENTERING A NEW AGE.

267
00:23:16,041 --> 00:23:18,709
[chirping]
