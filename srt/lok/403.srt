1
00:00:05,906 --> 00:00:07,173
Earth.

2
00:00:07,808 --> 00:00:09,260
Fire.

3
00:00:09,892 --> 00:00:11,085
Air.

4
00:00:11,409 --> 00:00:12,639
Water.

5
00:00:14,451 --> 00:00:18,453
Only the Avatar can
master all four elements...

6
00:00:18,455 --> 00:00:20,001
And bring balance to the world.

7
00:00:25,911 --> 00:00:28,146
So much has changed these past three years.

8
00:00:28,148 --> 00:00:30,682
Mako is a bodyguard for
the future earth king,

9
00:00:30,684 --> 00:00:32,717
Prince Wu, while Bolin works for Kuvira,

10
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:34,752
the earth kingdom's interim leader who has

11
00:00:34,754 --> 00:00:37,055
brought stability to a
nation plagued by chaos.

12
00:00:37,057 --> 00:00:39,757
Meanwhile, after wandering the
world trying to heal herself,

13
00:00:39,759 --> 00:00:42,627
a spirit led Korra to the swamp,
where she met Toph Beifong.

14
00:00:42,629 --> 00:00:44,829
Will this earthbending master be the key

15
00:00:44,831 --> 00:00:46,369
to Korra regaining her Avatar mojo?

16
00:00:53,072 --> 00:00:54,672
So then the crowds are gathered,

17
00:00:54,674 --> 00:00:56,241
all excited to see my coronation,

18
00:00:56,243 --> 00:00:59,410
when all of a sudden, these
boulders come rolling through.

19
00:00:59,412 --> 00:01:03,114
And guess what pops out
of 'em? Earthbender dames!

20
00:01:03,116 --> 00:01:05,683
These gals start banging
the boulders like drums

21
00:01:05,685 --> 00:01:07,652
and sing the song of my royal lineage.

22
00:01:07,654 --> 00:01:10,755
It's the most dynamite
six-hour show you've ever seen

23
00:01:10,757 --> 00:01:11,923
in your life.

24
00:01:11,925 --> 00:01:14,759
Shouldn't you be getting
ready to... I don't know...

25
00:01:14,761 --> 00:01:15,894
rule the whole nation?

26
00:01:15,896 --> 00:01:18,196
Now, now, now.
Don't get yourself in a tizzy.

27
00:01:18,198 --> 00:01:20,431
I'll have ministers for all that.

28
00:01:20,433 --> 00:01:23,067
No sir, Mako. When we get to Ba Sing Se,

29
00:01:23,069 --> 00:01:27,972
it'll just be two kooky
pals livin' the life!

30
00:01:27,974 --> 00:01:30,041
Yay...

31
00:01:30,043 --> 00:01:31,409
Getting excited for your big day?

32
00:01:31,411 --> 00:01:34,012
Does a platypus bear poop in... hey!

33
00:01:34,014 --> 00:01:35,214
You can't put bleachers there!

34
00:01:35,238 --> 00:01:38,182
There won't be enough room for
the dance of the badgermoles!

35
00:01:38,184 --> 00:01:41,719
Look, it's gonna go like this.

36
00:01:41,721 --> 00:01:44,889
You sure that's the guy you
want running the earth kingdom?

37
00:01:44,891 --> 00:01:46,491
Trust me. We'll be sending a delegation

38
00:01:46,515 --> 00:01:49,727
of experienced advisers to
handle day-to-day governing.

39
00:01:49,729 --> 00:01:52,330
I see the prince is becoming accustomed to

40
00:01:52,332 --> 00:01:54,065
the burdens of leadership.

41
00:01:54,067 --> 00:01:56,301
You know royals. They love a ceremony.

42
00:01:56,303 --> 00:01:59,070
Have you received any word
on the Avatar's location?

43
00:01:59,072 --> 00:02:02,006
Not yet, but I have
airbenders all over the world

44
00:02:02,008 --> 00:02:03,341
on the lookout for her.

45
00:02:03,343 --> 00:02:04,976
I hope they find her soon.

46
00:02:04,978 --> 00:02:06,458
I'm concerned about reports I've heard

47
00:02:06,482 --> 00:02:09,280
regarding Kuvira's growing military.

48
00:02:09,282 --> 00:02:11,950
They say she's throwing
some of her dissenters

49
00:02:11,952 --> 00:02:12,917
into prison camps.

50
00:02:12,919 --> 00:02:14,519
Well, she'll be stepping down tomorrow.

51
00:02:14,543 --> 00:02:17,455
We can worry about correcting
any of her mistakes after that.

52
00:02:17,457 --> 00:02:18,777
And you're not worried about her

53
00:02:18,801 --> 00:02:20,224
handing power over to Prince Wu?

54
00:02:20,226 --> 00:02:22,427
When Kuvira started cleaning
up the earth kingdom,

55
00:02:22,429 --> 00:02:24,529
she knew her position wasn't permanent.

56
00:02:24,531 --> 00:02:27,865
She gave me her word that she'd step down.

57
00:02:27,867 --> 00:02:32,337
Still, I'd feel a lot
better if Korra were here.

58
00:02:35,507 --> 00:02:39,377
You've gotta help me get back
into Avatar fighting shape.

59
00:02:39,379 --> 00:02:40,419
I'm getting my butt kicked

60
00:02:40,443 --> 00:02:43,281
by losers all over the earth kingdom.

61
00:02:43,283 --> 00:02:44,716
The world needs me.

62
00:02:44,718 --> 00:02:46,150
Get over yourself.

63
00:02:46,152 --> 00:02:48,886
The world doesn't need you one bit.

64
00:02:48,888 --> 00:02:50,688
But while I've been
the Avatar, I've stopped

65
00:02:50,712 --> 00:02:54,359
some really bad people from
doing some really bad things.

66
00:02:54,361 --> 00:02:59,163
Listen, when I was chief
of police of Republic City,

67
00:02:59,165 --> 00:03:02,133
I worked my butt off busting criminals.

68
00:03:02,135 --> 00:03:05,203
But did that make crime disappear?

69
00:03:05,205 --> 00:03:06,004
Nope.

70
00:03:06,006 --> 00:03:08,039
If there's one thing I learned on the beat,

71
00:03:08,041 --> 00:03:12,977
it's that the names change,
but the street stays the same.

72
00:03:12,979 --> 00:03:15,179
So, basically, you're saying that

73
00:03:15,181 --> 00:03:18,349
everything I've ever
accomplished has been pointless.

74
00:03:18,351 --> 00:03:20,918
And I thought Beifong was grumpy.

75
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:23,388
I'm the original Beifong.

76
00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:25,890
So, you're not gonna train me?

77
00:03:25,892 --> 00:03:29,727
Well, I was planning on
soaking my feet in mud

78
00:03:29,729 --> 00:03:30,795
for a few weeks.

79
00:03:30,797 --> 00:03:32,163
But I can't stand you

80
00:03:32,165 --> 00:03:36,801
being so pathetic and getting
your butt kicked all the time.

81
00:03:36,803 --> 00:03:39,404
All right. I guess I can help.

82
00:03:39,406 --> 00:03:41,806
- Thank you!
- Nah-ah-ah-ah.

83
00:03:41,808 --> 00:03:45,276
You want to hug something, go hug a tree.

84
00:03:45,278 --> 00:03:48,780
We're here to work.

85
00:03:50,849 --> 00:03:54,085
Hello, Republic City!

86
00:03:54,087 --> 00:03:57,021
Bolin is back!

87
00:03:57,523 --> 00:04:00,258
And Eska's also here.

88
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:03,461
I see you have replaced
me with a new girlfriend.

89
00:04:03,463 --> 00:04:06,497
Well done. She seems very threatening.

90
00:04:06,499 --> 00:04:08,132
Oh, no, no. That's Kuvira.

91
00:04:08,134 --> 00:04:09,267
She's kind of my boss.

92
00:04:09,269 --> 00:04:11,569
Boss. Girlfriend. Same thing.

93
00:04:11,571 --> 00:04:13,871
I'm afraid there's been
a mistake, your eminence.

94
00:04:13,873 --> 00:04:17,108
We have you and your brother
booked in the same room,

95
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:18,543
with only one bed.

96
00:04:18,545 --> 00:04:21,252
It's no mistake. Desna sleeps in the tub.

97
00:04:26,051 --> 00:04:27,531
Never thought I'd be allowed back in

98
00:04:27,555 --> 00:04:29,187
the Republic City four elements.

99
00:04:29,189 --> 00:04:30,349
Raiko must have turned purple

100
00:04:30,373 --> 00:04:33,291
when Kuvira made him pardon
me of my alleged crimes.

101
00:04:33,293 --> 00:04:36,127
You're an upstanding citizen again, sir.

102
00:04:36,129 --> 00:04:38,329
Upstanding is right! And don't forget to

103
00:04:38,331 --> 00:04:40,965
fill the extra bag with as
many of those little soaps

104
00:04:40,967 --> 00:04:45,036
as you can grab. Love the lavender scent.

105
00:04:46,905 --> 00:04:48,940
Bolin!

106
00:04:51,443 --> 00:04:52,243
Look at you!

107
00:04:52,245 --> 00:04:55,847
My little brother got all... Important.

108
00:04:55,849 --> 00:04:56,514
I know, right?

109
00:04:56,516 --> 00:04:57,982
I see myself in the mirror sometimes,

110
00:04:57,984 --> 00:04:59,704
and I think I'm in
trouble before I realize,

111
00:04:59,728 --> 00:05:00,485
it's only me.

112
00:05:00,487 --> 00:05:03,354
So... What's it like working for Kuvira?

113
00:05:03,356 --> 00:05:05,356
From what I've heard, she's pretty harsh.

114
00:05:05,358 --> 00:05:07,191
No! I mean, she can be tough, sure,

115
00:05:07,193 --> 00:05:09,093
but we're turning around the earth kingdom

116
00:05:09,095 --> 00:05:10,161
like you wouldn't believe.

117
00:05:10,163 --> 00:05:14,031
You remember how bad grandma's
neighborhood in Ba Sing Se was?

118
00:05:14,033 --> 00:05:15,233
All that's completely changed.

119
00:05:15,257 --> 00:05:16,868
I mean, we are really... Helping people.

120
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:19,470
But what have you been up to?
Fighting crime? Busting triads?

121
00:05:19,472 --> 00:05:22,406
Chasing the ladies, Mako style?

122
00:05:22,408 --> 00:05:26,110
Well, I've been working for Wu.

123
00:05:29,512 --> 00:05:34,018
And, uh... Yeah.

124
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:35,486
So have you seen Korra yet?

125
00:05:35,488 --> 00:05:38,022
No. She was supposed
to come in with Tonraq,

126
00:05:38,024 --> 00:05:40,892
but he says she left the
south pole months ago.

127
00:05:40,894 --> 00:05:43,895
No one knows where she is.

128
00:05:45,330 --> 00:05:46,898
Mother.

129
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:48,499
Hello, Baatar junior.

130
00:05:48,501 --> 00:05:50,535
It's just "Baatar" now.

131
00:05:50,537 --> 00:05:53,104
So, now that you've seen
all the good we've done

132
00:05:53,106 --> 00:05:55,439
since we left Zaofu, you must be sorry that

133
00:05:55,441 --> 00:05:56,674
you didn't come and help us.

134
00:05:56,676 --> 00:05:59,610
I don't know if I'd call marching
all over the earth kingdom,

135
00:05:59,612 --> 00:06:03,247
forcing people to bow
to Kuvira, "doing good."

136
00:06:03,249 --> 00:06:05,816
You're going to have to get
over your grudge with her.

137
00:06:05,818 --> 00:06:08,085
I'm sure you've heard that we're engaged.

138
00:06:08,087 --> 00:06:10,354
She's going to be an
official member of our family.

139
00:06:10,356 --> 00:06:13,991
I'm just glad that she'll be
stepping down after tomorrow.

140
00:06:13,993 --> 00:06:17,428
You prefer to be ruled by that royal idiot?

141
00:06:18,530 --> 00:06:20,631
I hope I'm not out of order saying this...

142
00:06:20,633 --> 00:06:24,969
You're pretty easy on the
eyes for a military type.

143
00:06:24,971 --> 00:06:27,605
I'll put in a good word for
you with the hotel staff,

144
00:06:27,607 --> 00:06:28,847
maybe get you a little upgrade.

145
00:06:28,871 --> 00:06:31,409
I've been living here
for years. They love me.

146
00:06:31,411 --> 00:06:33,110
I won't be needing your help.

147
00:06:33,112 --> 00:06:34,592
We've reserved the presidential suite.

148
00:06:34,616 --> 00:06:37,315
Well, I think someone is
pulling your chain, gumdrop.

149
00:06:37,317 --> 00:06:39,517
See, I'm in the presidential suite.

150
00:06:39,519 --> 00:06:42,486
Not anymore. I had you moved out.

151
00:06:42,488 --> 00:06:45,356
Wait, what? Cam, where's all my stuff?

152
00:06:45,358 --> 00:06:48,659
We moved you into a very nice junior suite

153
00:06:48,661 --> 00:06:50,027
on the seventh floor.

154
00:06:50,029 --> 00:06:51,262
Junior suite?

155
00:06:51,264 --> 00:06:54,398
Something you should know about me...

156
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:58,269
I always get what I want.

157
00:07:02,908 --> 00:07:05,977
Your royal cabinet is here, your majesty!

158
00:07:05,979 --> 00:07:06,844
Where have you been?

159
00:07:06,846 --> 00:07:08,546
My coronation is in ten minutes.

160
00:07:08,548 --> 00:07:09,513
Where's everyone else?

161
00:07:09,515 --> 00:07:11,635
Where are the seven sacred
chests of exquisite finery?

162
00:07:11,659 --> 00:07:14,352
Where are my grandfather's
taffeta pantaloons?

163
00:07:14,354 --> 00:07:17,154
Sadly, most of your servants were scattered

164
00:07:17,156 --> 00:07:20,958
and the royal things were
looted after the queen was...

165
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:21,626
Removed from office.

166
00:07:21,628 --> 00:07:27,298
So your coronation may not
have some of the usual items...

167
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:28,633
Like... The crown.

168
00:07:28,635 --> 00:07:29,533
There's no crown?

169
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:31,602
How can you have a
coronation without a crown?

170
00:07:31,604 --> 00:07:33,871
How will people know when
I'm officially the king?

171
00:07:33,873 --> 00:07:38,943
We still have one of the
royal jewels we can pin on you.

172
00:07:38,945 --> 00:07:39,577
An earring?

173
00:07:39,579 --> 00:07:43,481
Think of it more as a royal brooch.

174
00:07:43,483 --> 00:07:47,418
Are you telling me that there
are no dancing badgermoles?

175
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:48,619
No acrobat bell-ringers?

176
00:07:48,621 --> 00:07:50,288
No horn-blowing announcer-y guy?

177
00:07:50,290 --> 00:07:54,225
It will be a very simple,
intimate, elegant ceremony.

178
00:07:54,227 --> 00:07:56,360
A wonderful day for your kingdom.

179
00:07:56,362 --> 00:07:57,862
Just try on the brooch, your grace.

180
00:07:57,864 --> 00:08:00,112
You'll see it will look beau... don't...

181
00:08:00,131 --> 00:08:02,198
Touch me.

182
00:08:02,666 --> 00:08:05,368
Okay. Bring it.

183
00:08:22,654 --> 00:08:23,853
Tell me what you did wrong.

184
00:08:23,855 --> 00:08:26,756
Well... I was thinking
that you were gonna...

185
00:08:26,758 --> 00:08:27,723
exactly.

186
00:08:27,725 --> 00:08:30,193
You were thinking.

187
00:08:30,195 --> 00:08:32,028
Go again.

188
00:08:52,216 --> 00:08:52,982
Pathetic.

189
00:08:52,984 --> 00:08:57,920
Of all the avatars I've worked
with, you're by far the worst.

190
00:08:57,922 --> 00:09:01,624
I know that's only one
other Avatar, but still.

191
00:09:01,626 --> 00:09:02,558
Ah! Hey!

192
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:05,094
It seems like you're
enjoying having someone around

193
00:09:05,096 --> 00:09:06,195
to beat up an awful lot.

194
00:09:06,197 --> 00:09:10,666
Yeah, the swampbenders out
here really can't take a punch.

195
00:09:10,668 --> 00:09:13,402
So... What made you want to drop out

196
00:09:13,404 --> 00:09:15,044
and disconnect from the rest of the world?

197
00:09:15,068 --> 00:09:19,308
I'm more connected to the
world than you've ever been.

198
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:23,746
The roots and vines...
they run all over the world.

199
00:09:23,748 --> 00:09:28,885
I can see Su and Lin,
Zaofu and Republic City...

200
00:09:28,887 --> 00:09:33,389
I see everything.

201
00:09:36,928 --> 00:09:40,396
You're blind compared to me.

202
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:46,536
Now rise, Wu of the Hou-Ting Dynasty,

203
00:09:46,538 --> 00:09:48,404
king of all the earth lands,

204
00:09:48,406 --> 00:09:51,841
and glorious defender of Ba Sing Se.

205
00:09:51,843 --> 00:09:53,709
Long may you reign.

206
00:09:53,711 --> 00:09:56,712
Go Wu. Woo.

207
00:09:56,714 --> 00:10:00,917
Thank you for that incredibly
brief but very moving ceremony.

208
00:10:00,919 --> 00:10:04,820
I am touched by the love
of my devoted countrymen

209
00:10:04,822 --> 00:10:05,755
who have worked so hard

210
00:10:05,757 --> 00:10:08,558
to restore their beloved
leader to the throne.

211
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:11,260
One of them deserves special attention.

212
00:10:11,262 --> 00:10:13,563
Kuvira? Rise.

213
00:10:14,966 --> 00:10:18,634
For your service to the realm,
I would like to present you

214
00:10:18,636 --> 00:10:21,571
with the Kyoshi medal of freedom,

215
00:10:21,573 --> 00:10:22,838
our nation's highest honor,

216
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:28,344
which was somehow not stolen,
unlike the royal pinkie rings.

217
00:10:28,346 --> 00:10:29,245
Hmph.

218
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:30,012
Thank you.

219
00:10:30,014 --> 00:10:33,416
And if you don't mind, I'd
like to say a few words.

220
00:10:33,418 --> 00:10:37,820
Why not? We've got six hours to fill.

221
00:10:38,755 --> 00:10:41,757
Growing up in Zaofu with Suyin Beifong,

222
00:10:41,759 --> 00:10:45,628
I learned that the idea of a
royal family passing a title

223
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:48,831
from one generation to
the next was archaic,

224
00:10:48,833 --> 00:10:51,467
and that technology
and innovation should be

225
00:10:51,469 --> 00:10:52,768
what drives a nation forward.

226
00:10:52,770 --> 00:10:55,705
It was the pathetic rule of
kings and queens that caused

227
00:10:55,707 --> 00:10:59,842
the earth kingdom to descend
into such incredible disarray.

228
00:10:59,844 --> 00:11:04,013
It's taken me three years
to get it back on track,

229
00:11:04,015 --> 00:11:06,282
and there's no way I will allow it

230
00:11:06,284 --> 00:11:08,884
to slip back into the dark ages.

231
00:11:08,886 --> 00:11:12,254
I'd like to make an
announcement to the world.

232
00:11:12,256 --> 00:11:14,023
The earth kingdom is no more.

233
00:11:14,025 --> 00:11:18,494
And from here on out,
this man has no authority.

234
00:11:18,496 --> 00:11:19,656
Wait, what?

235
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,998
But I just got the royal brooch.

236
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,967
I have created a new earth empire,

237
00:11:24,969 --> 00:11:28,604
and I will continue to lead
it into the future myself,

238
00:11:28,606 --> 00:11:32,475
bringing about a new era
of prosperity for my people.

239
00:11:32,477 --> 00:11:35,911
We love you, Kuvira!

240
00:11:35,913 --> 00:11:40,549
All hail the great uniter!

241
00:11:40,551 --> 00:11:45,554
And let me assure my fellow
leaders of one thing...

242
00:11:45,556 --> 00:11:51,227
Anyone who crosses our
borders or stands in our way

243
00:11:51,229 --> 00:11:54,797
will be crushed.

244
00:11:55,832 --> 00:11:58,534
Thank you, Kuvira!

245
00:11:58,536 --> 00:12:00,870
All hail the great uniter!

246
00:12:00,872 --> 00:12:03,806
Worst coronation ever.

247
00:12:04,975 --> 00:12:08,144
Were you surprised? Because
I was really surprised.

248
00:12:08,146 --> 00:12:10,680
Won't this turn all the
world leaders against us?

249
00:12:10,682 --> 00:12:12,415
Relax, kid, what can they do?

250
00:12:12,417 --> 00:12:13,857
Kuvira controls the whole nation now,

251
00:12:13,881 --> 00:12:17,553
and Republic City is begging
for the metal that we're mining.

252
00:12:17,555 --> 00:12:19,922
This train has left the station,

253
00:12:19,924 --> 00:12:22,358
and we own the track!

254
00:12:25,796 --> 00:12:28,998
Now that's a nice-looking
hunk of spirit vine.

255
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,160
Let's take it back to the lab

256
00:12:30,184 --> 00:12:33,585
and get it stabilized immediately.

257
00:12:37,474 --> 00:12:39,675
You look worried, Bolin.

258
00:12:39,677 --> 00:12:42,044
Yeah, well... I just have some misgivings

259
00:12:42,046 --> 00:12:45,748
about how you kind of ambushed
Tenzin and the other leaders.

260
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:47,350
You believe in the work that we've done

261
00:12:47,351 --> 00:12:50,686
for the people of the
earth empire, right, Bolin?

262
00:12:50,688 --> 00:12:51,587
I do, but...

263
00:12:51,589 --> 00:12:52,488
then stick with me.

264
00:12:52,490 --> 00:12:55,391
I'm going to need your
help now more than ever.

265
00:12:55,393 --> 00:12:57,693
Raiko and the other leaders
want to bully us into

266
00:12:57,695 --> 00:13:00,863
accepting some idiot
king who will serve them

267
00:13:00,865 --> 00:13:02,031
but neglect the people.

268
00:13:02,033 --> 00:13:03,833
We have to stand strong against them.

269
00:13:03,835 --> 00:13:07,470
I'm just not sure about
this whole empire thing.

270
00:13:07,472 --> 00:13:09,405
It seems pretty aggressive.

271
00:13:09,407 --> 00:13:11,440
And what was that part about the crushing?

272
00:13:11,442 --> 00:13:14,376
That was just some tough
rhetoric to let people know

273
00:13:14,378 --> 00:13:15,378
that we mean business.

274
00:13:15,379 --> 00:13:19,115
Believe me, conflict is
the last thing I want.

275
00:13:19,117 --> 00:13:22,618
Will you help me make history, Bolin?

276
00:13:24,755 --> 00:13:28,390
Hmm. I'll stand by you.

277
00:13:28,392 --> 00:13:29,458
Thank you.

278
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:31,994
We need to talk.

279
00:13:32,963 --> 00:13:37,299
Can you give us the room, please?

280
00:13:39,569 --> 00:13:40,936
I met with the world leaders,

281
00:13:40,938 --> 00:13:42,905
and I've come as their representative.

282
00:13:42,907 --> 00:13:46,575
So now you're taking an
interest in world affairs?

283
00:13:46,577 --> 00:13:47,877
A little late, isn't it?

284
00:13:47,879 --> 00:13:50,179
When the queen fell and
everyone was asking you

285
00:13:50,181 --> 00:13:53,516
to help keep the earth
kingdom from falling apart,

286
00:13:53,518 --> 00:13:55,518
all you wanted to do was hide in Zaofu

287
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:57,653
and let others deal with the consequences.

288
00:13:57,655 --> 00:14:00,689
That's hardly fair. I
didn't want to seize power

289
00:14:00,691 --> 00:14:02,958
for myself, which is what you've done.

290
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:06,595
I'm telling you, for the good of everyone,

291
00:14:06,597 --> 00:14:08,063
you have to step down.

292
00:14:08,065 --> 00:14:09,765
I stepped up.

293
00:14:09,767 --> 00:14:11,867
I provide stability and equality.

294
00:14:11,869 --> 00:14:16,472
Tell your world leaders to stay
out of earth empire business.

295
00:14:16,474 --> 00:14:19,842
We won't accept their
hand-picked dictator.

296
00:14:19,844 --> 00:14:21,944
What makes you so different?

297
00:14:21,946 --> 00:14:23,112
You're just another tyrant.

298
00:14:23,114 --> 00:14:25,714
And don't pretend the
people put you where you are.

299
00:14:25,716 --> 00:14:27,716
I know what happens to
cities who don't want

300
00:14:27,718 --> 00:14:28,918
to hand over control to you.

301
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:33,823
Then you know what's coming for Zaofu.

302
00:14:36,693 --> 00:14:39,829
First I lose my suite,
then I lose my throne.

303
00:14:39,831 --> 00:14:42,698
My royal brooch is a lie!

304
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:43,899
I know you must be crushed,

305
00:14:43,901 --> 00:14:46,535
not getting to come back
to Ba Sing Se with me.

306
00:14:46,537 --> 00:14:50,105
Don't worry about me.
I'll find a way to make it.

307
00:14:50,107 --> 00:14:53,909
Good ol' Mako, my big tough guy.

308
00:14:53,911 --> 00:14:56,946
Ugh. Okay, I just have to go on,

309
00:14:56,948 --> 00:15:00,115
move forward, take decisive action.

310
00:15:00,117 --> 00:15:01,884
Let's go shopping!

311
00:15:07,891 --> 00:15:09,725
Ugh. Get rid of him.

312
00:15:09,727 --> 00:15:10,727
He's with her.

313
00:15:10,728 --> 00:15:13,095
He's my brother.

314
00:15:13,097 --> 00:15:14,864
Interesting ceremony, huh?

315
00:15:14,866 --> 00:15:16,999
You aren't going to keep working for Kuvira

316
00:15:17,001 --> 00:15:18,601
now that she's going against the wishes

317
00:15:18,603 --> 00:15:19,763
of the entire world, are you?

318
00:15:19,787 --> 00:15:22,504
You don't understand. Kuvira is helping out

319
00:15:22,506 --> 00:15:24,139
all the poor people in the earth empire,

320
00:15:24,141 --> 00:15:26,976
people like our family.
This is for the best.

321
00:15:26,978 --> 00:15:27,943
I don't know, bro.

322
00:15:27,945 --> 00:15:30,613
Okay, why don't you come with
me, and you'll see for yourself?

323
00:15:30,615 --> 00:15:33,015
We've done a lot of good,
and Varrick is working on

324
00:15:33,017 --> 00:15:35,451
some new innovations. We're making history.

325
00:15:35,453 --> 00:15:37,853
By crushing anyone who gets in your way?

326
00:15:37,855 --> 00:15:39,822
That was just some tough rhetoric

327
00:15:39,824 --> 00:15:42,124
to let the people know
that we mean business.

328
00:15:42,126 --> 00:15:44,960
I mean, Kuvira is
basically just like Korra...

329
00:15:44,962 --> 00:15:46,328
She might seem hard to deal with,

330
00:15:46,330 --> 00:15:48,898
but it's just because she's so passionate

331
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:50,599
and believes in what she's doing.

332
00:15:50,601 --> 00:15:52,568
It seems like she's just a dictator

333
00:15:52,570 --> 00:15:54,203
who's taking the earth kingdom by force.

334
00:15:54,205 --> 00:15:56,325
Oh, okay, so you think your
new best friend in there

335
00:15:56,349 --> 00:15:58,540
would be a better leader than Kuvira?

336
00:15:58,542 --> 00:16:00,509
- Well, no, but still...
- still what?

337
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:02,678
Come on, Mako, I'm making
a difference out there.

338
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:03,746
What are you doin', huh?

339
00:16:03,748 --> 00:16:05,648
You're just some glorified Butler

340
00:16:05,650 --> 00:16:07,616
for some snotty, rich bozo.

341
00:16:07,618 --> 00:16:09,084
I'm sorry. I don't want to work for

342
00:16:09,086 --> 00:16:12,821
your glorious emperor in
her military dictatorship.

343
00:16:12,823 --> 00:16:13,656
Fine!

344
00:16:13,658 --> 00:16:15,138
I'm gonna go back to my awesome train,

345
00:16:15,162 --> 00:16:16,959
where we bring freedom wherever we go.

346
00:16:16,961 --> 00:16:22,698
Enjoy licking the king's
boots in your junior suite!

347
00:16:28,505 --> 00:16:30,773
Sorry, sport. I heard it all.

348
00:16:30,775 --> 00:16:31,807
Can't believe him!

349
00:16:31,809 --> 00:16:34,843
I know! Insulting another man's suite?

350
00:16:34,845 --> 00:16:35,711
It's beneath low.

351
00:16:35,713 --> 00:16:37,846
But I think I know what
would cheer you up...

352
00:16:37,848 --> 00:16:40,849
A visit to little Ba Sing Se fashion mall!

353
00:16:40,851 --> 00:16:42,184
I'll buy you a smoothie.

354
00:16:42,186 --> 00:16:45,154
Yeah. Okay.

355
00:16:45,755 --> 00:16:47,056
That was terrible.

356
00:16:47,058 --> 00:16:48,691
Ha! Maybe for you.

357
00:16:48,693 --> 00:16:49,858
I had a great time!

358
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:54,229
I never realized how much I
missed tormenting the Avatar.

359
00:16:54,231 --> 00:16:56,565
I wish you were putting up more of a fight.

360
00:16:56,567 --> 00:16:57,533
But it was still fun.

361
00:16:57,535 --> 00:17:01,637
You were tossing me around
like a rag doll all day long.

362
00:17:01,639 --> 00:17:05,474
I know! And I'm an old lady.

363
00:17:05,476 --> 00:17:07,242
Imagine me in my prime.

364
00:17:07,244 --> 00:17:11,447
Ha-ha! I would have destroyed you!

365
00:17:11,449 --> 00:17:14,249
I just don't understand
why I can't get back

366
00:17:14,251 --> 00:17:16,352
to my former self. It's like...

367
00:17:16,354 --> 00:17:18,620
I'm a step slower. I'm tentative.

368
00:17:18,622 --> 00:17:19,321
I'm out of sync.

369
00:17:19,323 --> 00:17:21,156
I just can't get back in the groove.

370
00:17:21,158 --> 00:17:23,826
Probably carrying around
that metal doesn't help.

371
00:17:23,828 --> 00:17:24,693
What metal?

372
00:17:24,695 --> 00:17:28,330
The little bits of metal
poison stuck in your body.

373
00:17:28,332 --> 00:17:31,600
Are you trying to tell
me you can't feel metal

374
00:17:31,602 --> 00:17:32,701
in your own body?

375
00:17:32,703 --> 00:17:35,604
You really are the worst Avatar ever.

376
00:17:35,606 --> 00:17:36,939
I thought Su got it all out.

377
00:17:36,941 --> 00:17:39,975
No, my girls never really
picked up metalbending

378
00:17:39,977 --> 00:17:41,443
all that well, if you ask me.

379
00:17:41,445 --> 00:17:44,580
That's been my problem this entire time!

380
00:17:44,582 --> 00:17:45,314
I gotta get it out.

381
00:17:45,316 --> 00:17:46,949
You can get it out for me, right?

382
00:17:46,951 --> 00:17:50,085
Who do you think you're talking to?

383
00:17:52,088 --> 00:17:54,757
Once we're done with these,
we can go into the middle ring

384
00:17:54,759 --> 00:17:56,359
and I'll let you pick out some new suits.

385
00:17:56,383 --> 00:18:01,185
Then we'll hit the boutiques
in the upper ring for me.

386
00:18:04,768 --> 00:18:06,802
Where did you get those shirts?

387
00:18:06,804 --> 00:18:09,038
Aces, right? Kuvira is my hero.

388
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:11,940
They're selling them over there.

389
00:18:15,312 --> 00:18:16,812
You can't sell that junk in here!

390
00:18:16,814 --> 00:18:18,914
This is the little Ba Sing Se fashion mall,

391
00:18:18,916 --> 00:18:20,549
and I'm the little king here!

392
00:18:20,551 --> 00:18:21,250
Respect the brooch!

393
00:18:21,252 --> 00:18:25,621
Stop it, little king!

394
00:18:25,623 --> 00:18:28,824
I am the glorious defender!

395
00:18:29,359 --> 00:18:31,927
I'm covered in juice! Get him!

396
00:18:31,929 --> 00:18:34,029
We need to get you out of here.

397
00:18:34,031 --> 00:18:35,998
Ooh!

398
00:18:55,385 --> 00:18:57,186
It's destiny!

399
00:18:57,188 --> 00:18:59,822
Look where we are, Mako...

400
00:18:59,824 --> 00:19:02,891
The royal palace.

401
00:19:06,362 --> 00:19:09,031
The throne!

402
00:19:09,033 --> 00:19:11,767
Out of my way!

403
00:19:11,769 --> 00:19:14,069
Hey! It's my birthday!

404
00:19:14,071 --> 00:19:15,204
It's my coronation day!

405
00:19:15,206 --> 00:19:16,772
You'll have another birthday next year,

406
00:19:16,774 --> 00:19:19,942
but I'll never have this day back again!

407
00:19:19,944 --> 00:19:21,343
Never!

408
00:19:21,345 --> 00:19:23,112
Okay, you're losing it.

409
00:19:23,114 --> 00:19:27,015
This is the worst day of my life!

410
00:19:27,017 --> 00:19:29,251
Why?

411
00:19:29,253 --> 00:19:30,919
Do you really want to be the king?

412
00:19:30,921 --> 00:19:33,255
I mean, Kuvira might be
a power-crazed dictator,

413
00:19:33,257 --> 00:19:35,824
but at least she spent the
last few years working hard

414
00:19:35,826 --> 00:19:37,466
to make the earth kingdom somewhat better.

415
00:19:37,490 --> 00:19:38,994
If you were an earth kingdom citizen,

416
00:19:38,996 --> 00:19:42,030
do you think you're the kind
of person you want as your king?

417
00:19:42,032 --> 00:19:46,268
What have you ever done for your people?

418
00:19:46,270 --> 00:19:49,271
I'm sorry. That was out of line.

419
00:19:49,273 --> 00:19:50,772
No. You're right.

420
00:19:50,774 --> 00:19:53,008
No one ever talked to me like that before.

421
00:19:53,010 --> 00:19:57,779
I guess I'm just a joke
who got what he deserved.

422
00:19:58,214 --> 00:20:01,817
Let's get you out of here
and back to some place safe.

423
00:20:01,819 --> 00:20:03,752
- Carry me?
- No.

424
00:20:03,754 --> 00:20:07,156
Okay. If you want me
to bend out this metal,

425
00:20:07,158 --> 00:20:08,857
you need to relax.

426
00:20:08,859 --> 00:20:10,792
I am relaxed.

427
00:20:10,794 --> 00:20:11,894
Ha! Seriously?

428
00:20:11,896 --> 00:20:14,563
Your body is like a twisted tree trunk.

429
00:20:14,565 --> 00:20:18,133
Just do it! I'm ready!

430
00:20:30,047 --> 00:20:32,848
It wouldn't hurt if you would just relax!

431
00:20:32,850 --> 00:20:34,283
Stop fighting me!

432
00:20:34,285 --> 00:20:37,886
I'm not fighting!

433
00:20:49,299 --> 00:20:50,966
Ya! All right, that's it.

434
00:20:50,968 --> 00:20:53,168
You're going to have to do this yourself.

435
00:20:53,170 --> 00:20:56,405
Clearly, you want to
keep the metal in there.

436
00:20:56,407 --> 00:20:57,439
What do you mean?

437
00:20:57,441 --> 00:20:59,808
Why would I want poison inside me?

438
00:20:59,810 --> 00:21:02,844
I don't know. Maybe so you have an excuse

439
00:21:02,846 --> 00:21:04,680
not to go back to being the Avatar.

440
00:21:04,682 --> 00:21:06,682
If you don't get better,
you can't do your job,

441
00:21:06,684 --> 00:21:10,452
so you don't have to worry
about getting hurt again.

442
00:21:10,454 --> 00:21:12,554
What? That's ridiculous.

443
00:21:12,556 --> 00:21:15,290
Whatever. When you want it out,

444
00:21:15,292 --> 00:21:16,358
you can bend it out.

445
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:19,428
I can't deal with all your issues for you.

446
00:21:19,430 --> 00:21:23,165
Wait! What am I supposed to do now?

447
00:21:23,167 --> 00:21:24,099
How should I know?

448
00:21:24,101 --> 00:21:26,034
Ask the spirit that brought you here.

449
00:21:26,036 --> 00:21:30,038
The good news is, if you're
looking for a place to hang

450
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:31,540
where no one will bother you,

451
00:21:31,542 --> 00:21:36,411
you picked the best swamp in the world!

452
00:21:36,913 --> 00:21:40,215
This is a mission of the utmost importance.

453
00:21:40,217 --> 00:21:42,384
Conflict is coming to the earth kingdom,

454
00:21:42,386 --> 00:21:44,519
and we need to find the Avatar.

455
00:21:44,521 --> 00:21:48,957
Can I count on you three
to bring Korra home?

456
00:21:48,959 --> 00:21:51,260
You can count on one of us.

457
00:21:51,262 --> 00:21:55,731
I don't know about these two ladies.

458
00:22:08,244 --> 00:22:11,380
From now on, developing this technology is

459
00:22:11,382 --> 00:22:12,914
your number one priority.

460
00:22:12,916 --> 00:22:15,787
This is going to change everything.
