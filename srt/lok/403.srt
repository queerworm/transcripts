1
00:00:07,458 --> 00:00:10,125
- EARTH. FIRE.

2
00:00:10,166 --> 00:00:15,250
AIR. WATER.

3
00:00:15,291 --> 00:00:18,917
ONLY THE AVATAR CAN MASTER
ALL FOUR ELEMENTS...

4
00:00:18,959 --> 00:00:21,959
AND BRING BALANCE
TO THE WORLD.

5
00:00:27,166 --> 00:00:29,291
- SO MUCH HAS CHANGED
THESE PAST THREE YEARS.

6
00:00:29,333 --> 00:00:31,542
MAKO IS A BODYGUARD
FOR THE FUTURE EARTH KING,

7
00:00:31,583 --> 00:00:33,667
PRINCE WU, WHILE
BOLIN WORKS FOR KUVIRA,

8
00:00:33,709 --> 00:00:35,792
THE EARTH KINGDOM'S
INTERIM LEADER WHO HAS

9
00:00:35,834 --> 00:00:38,458
BROUGHT STABILITY TO
A NATION PLAGUED BY CHAOS.

10
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:41,041
MEANWHILE, AFTER WANDERING THE
WORLD TRYING TO HEAL HERSELF,

11
00:00:41,083 --> 00:00:43,500
A SPIRIT LED KORRA TO THE SWAMP,
WHERE SHE MET TOPH BEIFONG.

12
00:00:43,542 --> 00:00:45,583
WILL THIS EARTHBENDING MASTER
BE THE KEY

13
00:00:45,625 --> 00:00:47,000
TO KORRA REGAINING
HER AVATAR MOJO?

14
00:00:53,959 --> 00:00:55,375
- SO THEN THE CROWDS
ARE GATHERED,

15
00:00:55,417 --> 00:00:57,625
ALL EXCITED TO SEE
MY CORONATION,

16
00:00:57,667 --> 00:01:00,500
WHEN ALL OF A SUDDEN, THESE
BOULDERS COME ROLLING THROUGH.

17
00:01:00,542 --> 00:01:04,333
AND GUESS WHAT POPS OUT OF 'EM?
EARTHBENDER DAMES!

18
00:01:04,375 --> 00:01:06,542
THESE GALS START BANGING THE
BOULDERS LIKE DRUMS

19
00:01:06,583 --> 00:01:08,834
AND SING THE SONG OF
MY ROYAL LINEAGE.

20
00:01:08,875 --> 00:01:11,125
IT'S THE MOST DYNAMITE
SIX-HOUR SHOW YOU'VE EVER SEEN

21
00:01:11,166 --> 00:01:13,125
IN YOUR LIFE.

22
00:01:13,166 --> 00:01:15,291
- SHOULDN'T YOU BE GETTING READY
TO--I DON'T KNOW--

23
00:01:15,333 --> 00:01:17,000
RULE THE WHOLE NATION?

24
00:01:17,041 --> 00:01:19,166
- NOW, NOW, NOW.
DON'T GET YOURSELF IN A TIZZY.

25
00:01:19,208 --> 00:01:21,333
I'LL HAVE MINISTERS
FOR ALL THAT.

26
00:01:21,375 --> 00:01:24,166
NO SIR, MAKO.
WHEN WE GET TO BA SING SE,

27
00:01:24,208 --> 00:01:28,208
IT'LL JUST BE TWO KOOKY PALS
LIVIN' THE LIFE!

28
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:31,000
- YAY...

29
00:01:31,041 --> 00:01:32,208
- GETTING EXCITED FOR
YOUR BIG DAY?

30
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:34,750
- DOES A PLATYPUS BEAR
POOP IN--HEY!

31
00:01:34,792 --> 00:01:36,667
YOU CAN'T PUT BLEACHERS THERE!

32
00:01:36,709 --> 00:01:39,208
THERE WON'T BE ENOUGH ROOM FOR
THE DANCE OF THE BADGERMOLES!

33
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:43,125
LOOK, IT'S GONNA GO LIKE THIS.
[humming]

34
00:01:43,166 --> 00:01:45,917
- YOU SURE THAT'S THE GUY YOU
WANT RUNNING THE EARTH KINGDOM?

35
00:01:45,959 --> 00:01:47,625
- TRUST ME.
WE'LL BE SENDING A DELEGATION

36
00:01:47,667 --> 00:01:50,750
OF EXPERIENCED ADVISORS TO
HANDLE DAY-TO-DAY GOVERNING.

37
00:01:50,792 --> 00:01:52,834
- I SEE THE PRINCE IS BECOMING
ACCUSTOMED TO

38
00:01:52,875 --> 00:01:55,125
THE BURDENS OF LEADERSHIP.

39
00:01:55,166 --> 00:01:57,375
- YOU KNOW ROYALS.
THEY LOVE A CEREMONY.

40
00:01:57,417 --> 00:02:00,375
HAVE YOU RECEIVED ANY WORD
ON THE AVATAR'S LOCATION?

41
00:02:00,417 --> 00:02:02,709
- NOT YET, BUT I HAVE
AIRBENDERS ALL OVER THE WORLD

42
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:03,917
ON THE LOOKOUT FOR HER.

43
00:02:03,959 --> 00:02:06,041
I HOPE THEY FIND HER SOON.

44
00:02:06,083 --> 00:02:07,250
I'M CONCERNED ABOUT
REPORTS I'VE HEARD

45
00:02:07,291 --> 00:02:10,333
REGARDING KUVIRA'S
GROWING MILITARY.

46
00:02:10,375 --> 00:02:12,500
THEY SAY SHE'S THROWING
SOME OF HER DISSENTERS

47
00:02:12,542 --> 00:02:14,000
INTO PRISON CAMPS.

48
00:02:14,041 --> 00:02:15,792
- WELL, SHE'LL BE STEPPING DOWN
TOMORROW.

49
00:02:15,834 --> 00:02:18,208
WE CAN WORRY ABOUT CORRECTING
ANY OF HER MISTAKES AFTER THAT.

50
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:19,458
- AND YOU'RE NOT WORRIED
ABOUT HER

51
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:21,625
HANDING POWER OVER TO PRINCE WU?

52
00:02:21,667 --> 00:02:23,333
- WHEN KUVIRA STARTED
CLEANING UP THE EARTH KINGDOM,

53
00:02:23,375 --> 00:02:25,458
SHE KNEW HER POSITION
WASN'T PERMANENT.

54
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:29,125
SHE GAVE ME HER WORD THAT
SHE'D STEP DOWN.

55
00:02:29,166 --> 00:02:32,792
- STILL, I'D FEEL A LOT BETTER
IF KORRA WERE HERE.

56
00:02:32,834 --> 00:02:34,792
- [humming and grunting]

57
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:39,959
- YOU'VE GOTTA HELP ME GET BACK
INTO AVATAR FIGHTING SHAPE.

58
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,291
I'M GETTING MY BUTT KICKED

59
00:02:41,333 --> 00:02:43,709
BY LOSERS ALL OVER
THE EARTH KINGDOM.

60
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:45,250
THE WORLD NEEDS ME.

61
00:02:45,291 --> 00:02:47,125
- GET OVER YOURSELF.

62
00:02:47,166 --> 00:02:50,041
THE WORLD DOESN'T
NEED YOU ONE BIT.

63
00:02:50,083 --> 00:02:51,875
- BUT WHILE I'VE BEEN
THE AVATAR, I'VE STOPPED

64
00:02:51,917 --> 00:02:55,542
SOME REALLY BAD PEOPLE FROM
DOING SOME REALLY BAD THINGS.

65
00:02:55,583 --> 00:03:00,250
- LISTEN, WHEN I WAS CHIEF OF
POLICE OF REPUBLIC CITY,

66
00:03:00,291 --> 00:03:03,208
I WORKED MY BUTT OFF
BUSTING CRIMINALS.

67
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:05,625
BUT DID THAT
MAKE CRIME DISAPPEAR?

68
00:03:05,667 --> 00:03:07,208
NOPE.

69
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:09,583
IF THERE'S ONE THING
I LEARNED ON THE BEAT,

70
00:03:09,625 --> 00:03:13,959
IT'S THAT THE NAMES CHANGE,
BUT THE STREET STAYS THE SAME.

71
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,625
- SO, BASICALLY,
YOU'RE SAYING THAT

72
00:03:16,667 --> 00:03:19,250
EVERYTHING I'VE EVER
ACCOMPLISHED HAS BEEN POINTLESS.

73
00:03:19,291 --> 00:03:21,750
AND I THOUGHT
BEIFONG WAS GRUMPY.

74
00:03:21,792 --> 00:03:24,125
- I'M THE ORIGINAL BEIFONG.

75
00:03:24,166 --> 00:03:27,166
- SO, YOU'RE NOT GONNA TRAIN ME?

76
00:03:27,208 --> 00:03:30,208
- WELL, I WAS PLANNING ON
SOAKING MY FEET IN MUD

77
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:31,709
FOR A FEW WEEKS.

78
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:33,792
[sighs]
BUT I CAN'T STAND YOU

79
00:03:33,834 --> 00:03:37,709
BEING SO PATHETIC AND GETTING
YOUR BUTT KICKED ALL THE TIME.

80
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:40,166
ALL RIGHT.
I GUESS I CAN HELP.

81
00:03:40,208 --> 00:03:42,917
- THANK YOU!
- NAH-AH-AH-AH.

82
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:45,750
YOU WANT TO HUG SOMETHING,
GO HUG A TREE.

83
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:48,750
WE'RE HERE TO WORK.

84
00:03:51,583 --> 00:03:54,625
- HELLO, REPUBLIC CITY!

85
00:03:54,667 --> 00:03:57,041
BOLIN IS BACK!

86
00:03:58,166 --> 00:04:01,542
AND ESKA'S ALSO HERE.

87
00:04:01,583 --> 00:04:04,542
- I SEE YOU HAVE REPLACED ME
WITH A NEW GIRLFRIEND.

88
00:04:04,583 --> 00:04:07,375
WELL DONE.
SHE SEEMS VERY THREATENING.

89
00:04:07,417 --> 00:04:08,959
- OH, NO, NO.
THAT'S KUVIRA.

90
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,166
SHE'S KIND OF MY BOSS.

91
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:12,875
- BOSS. GIRLFRIEND.
SAME THING.

92
00:04:12,917 --> 00:04:15,291
- I'M AFRAID THERE'S BEEN
A MISTAKE, YOUR EMINENCE.

93
00:04:15,333 --> 00:04:17,834
WE HAVE YOU AND YOUR BROTHER
BOOKED IN THE SAME ROOM,

94
00:04:17,875 --> 00:04:19,667
WITH ONLY ONE BED.

95
00:04:19,709 --> 00:04:24,166
- IT'S NO MISTAKE.
DESNA SLEEPS IN THE TUB.

96
00:04:27,125 --> 00:04:28,291
- NEVER THOUGHT I'D BE
ALLOWED BACK IN

97
00:04:28,333 --> 00:04:30,166
THE REPUBLIC CITY FOUR ELEMENTS.

98
00:04:30,208 --> 00:04:31,583
RAIKO MUST HAVE TURNED PURPLE

99
00:04:31,625 --> 00:04:34,375
WHEN KUVIRA MADE HIM PARDON ME
OF MY ALLEGED CRIMES.

100
00:04:34,417 --> 00:04:37,458
- YOU'RE AN UPSTANDING CITIZEN
AGAIN, SIR.

101
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:39,709
- UPSTANDING IS RIGHT!
AND DON'T FORGET TO

102
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:42,125
FILL THE EXTRA BAG WITH
AS MANY OF THOSE LITTLE SOAPS

103
00:04:42,166 --> 00:04:45,166
AS YOU CAN GRAB.
LOVE THE LAVENDER SCENT.

104
00:04:47,375 --> 00:04:49,041
- BOLIN!

105
00:04:51,917 --> 00:04:53,500
LOOK AT YOU!

106
00:04:53,542 --> 00:04:56,417
MY LITTLE BROTHER GOT ALL...
IMPORTANT.

107
00:04:56,458 --> 00:04:57,542
- I KNOW, RIGHT?

108
00:04:57,583 --> 00:04:59,083
I SEE MYSELF IN THE MIRROR
SOMETIMES,

109
00:04:59,125 --> 00:05:00,458
AND I THINK I'M
IN TROUBLE BEFORE I REALIZE,

110
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:01,709
IT'S ONLY ME.

111
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:04,542
- SO...WHAT'S IT LIKE
WORKING FOR KUVIRA?

112
00:05:04,583 --> 00:05:06,458
FROM WHAT I'VE HEARD,
SHE'S PRETTY HARSH.

113
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:08,500
- NO!
I MEAN, SHE CAN BE TOUGH, SURE,

114
00:05:08,542 --> 00:05:10,041
BUT WE'RE TURNING AROUND
THE EARTH KINGDOM

115
00:05:10,083 --> 00:05:11,959
LIKE YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE.

116
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,041
YOU REMEMBER HOW BAD GRANDMA'S
NEIGHBORHOOD IN BA SING SE WAS?

117
00:05:15,083 --> 00:05:16,417
ALL THAT'S COMPLETELY CHANGED.

118
00:05:16,458 --> 00:05:18,583
I MEAN, WE ARE REALLY...
HELPING PEOPLE.

119
00:05:18,625 --> 00:05:20,500
BUT WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN UP TO?
FIGHTING CRIME? BUSTING TRIADS?

120
00:05:20,542 --> 00:05:23,417
CHASING THE LADIES,
MAKO STYLE?

121
00:05:23,458 --> 00:05:26,333
- WELL, I'VE BEEN
WORKING FOR WU.

122
00:05:30,875 --> 00:05:35,041
AND, UH...YEAH.

123
00:05:35,083 --> 00:05:36,750
- SO HAVE YOU SEEN KORRA YET?

124
00:05:36,792 --> 00:05:39,458
- NO. SHE WAS SUPPOSED TO
COME IN WITH TONRAQ,

125
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:41,792
BUT HE SAYS SHE LEFT
THE SOUTH POLE MONTHS AGO.

126
00:05:41,834 --> 00:05:44,041
NO ONE KNOWS WHERE SHE IS.

127
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:47,750
- MOTHER.

128
00:05:47,792 --> 00:05:49,250
- HELLO, BAATAR JUNIOR.

129
00:05:49,291 --> 00:05:51,834
- IT'S JUST "BAATAR" NOW.

130
00:05:51,875 --> 00:05:54,458
SO, NOW THAT YOU'VE SEEN
ALL THE GOOD WE'VE DONE

131
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:56,250
SINCE WE LEFT ZAOFU,
YOU MUST BE SORRY THAT

132
00:05:56,291 --> 00:05:58,250
YOU DIDN'T COME AND HELP US.

133
00:05:58,291 --> 00:06:01,000
- I DON'T IF I'D CALL MARCHING
ALL OVER THE EARTH KINGDOM,

134
00:06:01,041 --> 00:06:04,750
FORCING PEOPLE TO BOW TO KUVIRA,
"DOING GOOD."

135
00:06:04,792 --> 00:06:07,208
- YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO
GET OVER YOUR GRUDGE WITH HER.

136
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:09,750
I'M SURE YOU'VE HEARD
THAT WE'RE ENGAGED.

137
00:06:09,792 --> 00:06:12,000
SHE'S GOING TO BE AN OFFICIAL
MEMBER OF OUR FAMILY.

138
00:06:12,041 --> 00:06:15,458
- I'M JUST GLAD THAT SHE'LL BE
STEPPING DOWN AFTER TOMORROW.

139
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,542
- YOU PREFER TO BE RULED BY
THAT ROYAL IDIOT?

140
00:06:19,875 --> 00:06:22,125
- I HOPE I'M NOT
OUT OF ORDER SAYING THIS...

141
00:06:22,166 --> 00:06:26,625
YOU'RE PRETTY EASY ON THE EYES
FOR A MILITARY TYPE.

142
00:06:26,667 --> 00:06:28,625
I'LL PUT IN A GOOD WORD FOR YOU
WITH THE HOTEL STAFF,

143
00:06:28,667 --> 00:06:30,166
MAYBE GET YOU A LITTLE UPGRADE.

144
00:06:30,208 --> 00:06:32,375
I'VE BEEN LIVING HERE FOR YEARS.
THEY LOVE ME.

145
00:06:32,417 --> 00:06:34,458
- I WON'T BE NEEDING YOUR HELP.

146
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:35,917
WE'VE RESERVED
THE PRESIDENTIAL SUITE.

147
00:06:35,959 --> 00:06:38,417
- WELL, I THINK SOMEONE IS
PULLING YOUR CHAIN, GUMDROP.

148
00:06:38,458 --> 00:06:40,625
SEE, I'M IN
THE PRESIDENTIAL SUITE.

149
00:06:40,667 --> 00:06:43,750
- NOT ANYMORE.
I HAD YOU MOVED OUT.

150
00:06:43,792 --> 00:06:46,625
- WAIT, WHAT?
CAM, WHERE'S ALL MY STUFF?

151
00:06:46,667 --> 00:06:49,500
- WE MOVED YOU INTO
A VERY NICE JUNIOR SUITE

152
00:06:49,542 --> 00:06:50,834
ON THE SEVENTH FLOOR.

153
00:06:50,875 --> 00:06:52,458
- JUNIOR SUITE?

154
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:55,208
- SOMETHING YOU SHOULD KNOW
ABOUT ME...

155
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:58,333
I ALWAYS GET WHAT I WANT.

156
00:07:04,709 --> 00:07:07,208
- YOUR ROYAL CABINET IS HERE,
YOUR MAJESTY!

157
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:08,208
- WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?

158
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:09,667
MY CORONATION IS IN TEN MINUTES.

159
00:07:09,709 --> 00:07:11,375
WHERE'S EVERYONE ELSE?

160
00:07:11,417 --> 00:07:13,333
WHERE ARE THE SEVEN SACRED
CHESTS OF EXQUISITE FINERY?

161
00:07:13,375 --> 00:07:15,917
WHERE ARE MY GRANDFATHER'S
TAFFETA PANTALOONS?

162
00:07:15,959 --> 00:07:18,875
- SADLY, MOST OF
YOUR SERVANTS WERE SCATTERED

163
00:07:18,917 --> 00:07:22,125
AND THE ROYAL THINGS WERE LOOTED
AFTER THE QUEEN WAS...

164
00:07:22,166 --> 00:07:23,709
REMOVED FROM OFFICE.

165
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:28,250
SO YOUR CORONATION MAY NOT HAVE
SOME OF THE USUAL ITEMS...

166
00:07:28,291 --> 00:07:29,750
LIKE...THE CROWN.

167
00:07:29,792 --> 00:07:31,208
- THERE'S NO CROWN?

168
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:33,333
HOW CAN YOU HAVE
A CORONATION WITHOUT A CROWN?

169
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:35,917
HOW WILL PEOPLE KNOW WHEN
I'M OFFICIALLY THE KING?

170
00:07:35,959 --> 00:07:40,000
- WE STILL HAVE ONE OF THE
ROYAL JEWELS WE CAN PIN ON YOU.

171
00:07:40,041 --> 00:07:41,083
- AN EARRING?

172
00:07:41,125 --> 00:07:45,458
- THINK OF IT MORE
AS A ROYAL BROOCH.

173
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:48,500
- ARE YOU TELLING ME THAT THERE
ARE NO DANCING BADGERMOLES?

174
00:07:48,542 --> 00:07:49,917
NO ACROBAT BELL-RINGERS?

175
00:07:49,959 --> 00:07:52,125
NO HORN-BLOWING ANNOUNCER-Y GUY?

176
00:07:52,166 --> 00:07:55,542
- IT WILL BE A VERY SIMPLE,
INTIMATE, ELEGANT CEREMONY.

177
00:07:55,583 --> 00:07:57,792
A WONDERFUL DAY
FOR YOUR KINGDOM.

178
00:07:57,834 --> 00:07:59,500
JUST TRY ON THE BROOCH,
YOUR GRACE.

179
00:07:59,542 --> 00:08:01,750
YOU'LL SEE IT WILL LOOK BEAU--
- DON'T...

180
00:08:01,792 --> 00:08:03,458
TOUCH ME.

181
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:06,709
- OKAY.
BRING IT.

182
00:08:14,542 --> 00:08:16,041
- [yells]

183
00:08:16,083 --> 00:08:21,542
[grunts]

184
00:08:21,583 --> 00:08:23,250
[creature chirps]

185
00:08:23,291 --> 00:08:24,250
[ribbits]

186
00:08:24,291 --> 00:08:25,834
- TELL ME WHAT YOU DID WRONG.

187
00:08:25,875 --> 00:08:27,959
- WELL...I WAS THINKING THAT
YOU WERE GONNA--

188
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,083
- EXACTLY.

189
00:08:29,125 --> 00:08:31,208
YOU WERE THINKING.

190
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:32,875
GO AGAIN.

191
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:35,417
- [grunts]

192
00:08:39,792 --> 00:08:43,375
[grunts]

193
00:08:43,417 --> 00:08:48,125
[wailing]

194
00:08:48,166 --> 00:08:49,333
[breathing heavily]

195
00:08:53,375 --> 00:08:55,375
- PATHETIC.

196
00:08:55,417 --> 00:09:00,000
OF ALL THE AVATARS I'VE WORKED
WITH, YOU'RE BY FAR THE WORST.

197
00:09:00,041 --> 00:09:02,875
I KNOW THAT'S ONLY
ONE OTHER AVATAR, BUT STILL.

198
00:09:02,917 --> 00:09:04,750
- AH! HEY!

199
00:09:04,792 --> 00:09:06,709
IT SEEMS LIKE YOU'RE ENJOYING
HAVING SOMEONE AROUND

200
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:08,458
TO BEAT UP AN AWFUL LOT.

201
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:12,500
- YEAH, THE SWAMPBENDERS OUT
HERE REALLY CAN'T TAKE A PUNCH.

202
00:09:12,542 --> 00:09:15,333
- SO...WHAT MADE YOU
WANT TO DROP OUT

203
00:09:15,375 --> 00:09:17,375
AND DISCONNECT FROM
THE REST OF THE WORLD?

204
00:09:17,417 --> 00:09:21,375
- I'M MORE CONNECTED TO THE
WORLD THAN YOU'VE EVER BEEN.

205
00:09:21,417 --> 00:09:25,875
THE ROOTS AND VINES--
THEY RUN ALL OVER THE WORLD.

206
00:09:25,917 --> 00:09:30,333
I CAN SEE SU AND LIN,
ZAOFU AND REPUBLIC CITY...

207
00:09:30,375 --> 00:09:34,166
I SEE EVERYTHING.

208
00:09:37,583 --> 00:09:38,667
- [grunts]

209
00:09:38,709 --> 00:09:41,166
- YOU'RE BLIND COMPARED TO ME.

210
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:48,125
- NOW RISE, WU
OF THE HOU-TING DYNASTY,

211
00:09:48,166 --> 00:09:50,208
KING OF ALL THE EARTH LANDS,

212
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:53,333
AND GLORIOUS DEFENDER
OF BA SING SE.

213
00:09:53,375 --> 00:09:55,333
LONG MAY YOU REIGN.

214
00:09:55,375 --> 00:09:59,166
[applause]
- GO WU. WOO.

215
00:09:59,208 --> 00:10:03,000
- THANK YOU FOR THAT INCREDIBLY
BRIEF BUT VERY MOVING CEREMONY.

216
00:10:03,041 --> 00:10:06,375
I AM TOUCHED BY THE LOVE
OF MY DEVOTED COUNTRYMEN

217
00:10:06,417 --> 00:10:07,834
WHO HAVE WORKED SO HARD

218
00:10:07,875 --> 00:10:10,458
TO RESTORE THEIR BELOVED LEADER
TO THE THRONE.

219
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,583
ONE OF THEM DESERVES
SPECIAL ATTENTION.

220
00:10:12,625 --> 00:10:14,792
KUVIRA?
RISE.

221
00:10:14,834 --> 00:10:17,375
[applause]

222
00:10:17,417 --> 00:10:20,417
FOR YOUR SERVICE TO THE REALM,
I WOULD LIKE TO PRESENT YOU

223
00:10:20,458 --> 00:10:23,166
WITH THE KYOSHI
MEDAL OF FREEDOM,

224
00:10:23,208 --> 00:10:25,250
OUR NATION'S HIGHEST HONOR,

225
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:29,417
WHICH WAS SOMEHOW NOT STOLEN,
UNLIKE THE ROYAL PINKIE RINGS.

226
00:10:29,458 --> 00:10:30,417
HMPH.

227
00:10:30,458 --> 00:10:32,250
- THANK YOU.

228
00:10:32,291 --> 00:10:35,250
AND IF YOU DON'T MIND,
I'D LIKE TO SAY A FEW WORDS.

229
00:10:35,291 --> 00:10:38,667
- WHY NOT?
WE'VE GOT SIX HOURS TO FILL.

230
00:10:40,792 --> 00:10:44,041
- GROWING UP IN ZAOFU
WITH SUYIN BEIFONG,

231
00:10:44,083 --> 00:10:47,583
I LEARNED THAT THE IDEA OF
A ROYAL FAMILY PASSING A TITLE

232
00:10:47,625 --> 00:10:50,917
FROM ONE GENERATION
TO THE NEXT WAS ARCHAIC,

233
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:53,083
AND THAT TECHNOLOGY AND
INNOVATION SHOULD BE

234
00:10:53,125 --> 00:10:55,083
WHAT DRIVES A NATION FORWARD.

235
00:10:55,125 --> 00:10:58,041
IT WAS THE PATHETIC RULE OF
KINGS AND QUEENS THAT CAUSED

236
00:10:58,083 --> 00:11:02,041
THE EARTH KINGDOM TO DESCEND
INTO SUCH INCREDIBLE DISARRAY.

237
00:11:02,083 --> 00:11:06,000
IT'S TAKEN ME THREE YEARS
TO GET IT BACK ON TRACK,

238
00:11:06,041 --> 00:11:07,917
AND THERE'S NO WAY
I WILL ALLOW IT

239
00:11:07,959 --> 00:11:11,041
TO SLIP BACK INTO THE DARK AGES.

240
00:11:11,083 --> 00:11:13,875
I'D LIKE TO MAKE
AN ANNOUNCEMENT TO THE WORLD.

241
00:11:13,917 --> 00:11:16,291
THE EARTH KINGDOM IS NO MORE.

242
00:11:16,333 --> 00:11:20,583
AND FROM HERE ON OUT,
THIS MAN HAS NO AUTHORITY.
[audience gasps]
- WAIT, WHAT?

243
00:11:20,625 --> 00:11:23,333
BUT I JUST GOT THE ROYAL BROOCH.

244
00:11:23,375 --> 00:11:26,709
- I HAVE CREATED
A NEW EARTH EMPIRE,

245
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:30,250
AND I WILL CONTINUE TO LEAD IT
INTO THE FUTURE MYSELF,

246
00:11:30,291 --> 00:11:32,792
BRINGING ABOUT A NEW ERA
OF PROSPERITY FOR<i> MY</i> PEOPLE.

247
00:11:32,834 --> 00:11:36,041
[audience cheers]
- WE LOVE YOU, KUVIRA!

248
00:11:36,083 --> 00:11:41,208
- ALL HAIL THE GREAT UNITER!

249
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:46,125
- AND LET ME ASSURE MY FELLOW
LEADERS OF ONE THING...

250
00:11:46,166 --> 00:11:50,875
ANYONE WHO CROSSES OUR BORDERS
OR STANDS IN OUR WAY

251
00:11:50,917 --> 00:11:54,083
WILL BE CRUSHED.

252
00:11:56,208 --> 00:11:58,583
[audience cheers]
- THANK YOU, KUVIRA!

253
00:11:58,625 --> 00:12:00,917
ALL HAIL THE GREAT UNITER!

254
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:03,166
- WORST CORONATION EVER.

255
00:12:05,834 --> 00:12:08,917
- WERE YOU SURPRISED?
BECAUSE I WAS REALLY SURPRISED.

256
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:10,875
WON'T THIS TURN ALL
THE WORLD LEADERS AGAINST US?

257
00:12:10,917 --> 00:12:12,792
- RELAX, KID, WHAT CAN THEY DO?

258
00:12:12,834 --> 00:12:14,625
KUVIRA CONTROLS
THE WHOLE NATION NOW,

259
00:12:14,667 --> 00:12:17,709
AND REPUBLIC CITY IS BEGGING FOR
THE METAL THAT WE'RE MINING.

260
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:20,000
THIS TRAIN HAS LEFT THE STATION,

261
00:12:20,041 --> 00:12:22,041
AND WE OWN THE TRACK!

262
00:12:26,458 --> 00:12:29,250
NOW THAT'S A NICE-LOOKING HUNK
OF SPIRIT VINE.

263
00:12:29,291 --> 00:12:30,542
LET'S TAKE IT BACK TO THE LAB

264
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:32,792
AND GET IT STABILIZED
IMMEDIATELY.

265
00:12:37,542 --> 00:12:40,208
- YOU LOOK WORRIED, BOLIN.

266
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:43,000
- YEAH, WELL...
I JUST HAVE SOME MISGIVINGS

267
00:12:43,041 --> 00:12:46,125
ABOUT HOW YOU KIND OF AMBUSHED
TENZIN AND THE OTHER LEADERS.

268
00:12:46,166 --> 00:12:47,875
- YOU BELIEVE IN
THE WORK THAT WE'VE DONE

269
00:12:47,917 --> 00:12:50,500
FOR THE PEOPLE OF
THE EARTH EMPIRE, RIGHT, BOLIN?

270
00:12:50,542 --> 00:12:51,542
- I DO, BUT--

271
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:53,041
- THEN STICK WITH ME.

272
00:12:53,083 --> 00:12:56,000
I'M GOING TO NEED YOUR HELP NOW
MORE THAN EVER.

273
00:12:56,041 --> 00:12:58,250
RAIKO AND THE OTHER LEADERS
WANT TO BULLY US INTO

274
00:12:58,291 --> 00:13:01,041
ACCEPTING SOME IDIOT KING
WHO WILL SERVE THEM

275
00:13:01,083 --> 00:13:02,625
BUT NEGLECT THE PEOPLE.

276
00:13:02,667 --> 00:13:04,542
WE HAVE TO STAND STRONG
AGAINST THEM.

277
00:13:04,583 --> 00:13:07,625
- I'M JUST NOT SURE ABOUT
THIS WHOLE EMPIRE THING.

278
00:13:07,667 --> 00:13:09,917
IT SEEMS PRETTY AGGRESSIVE.

279
00:13:09,959 --> 00:13:12,208
AND WHAT WAS THAT PART
ABOUT THE CRUSHING?

280
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:14,375
- THAT WAS JUST SOME TOUGH
RHETORIC TO LET PEOPLE KNOW

281
00:13:14,417 --> 00:13:15,959
THAT WE MEAN BUSINESS.

282
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,625
BELIEVE ME, CONFLICT IS
THE LAST THING I WANT.

283
00:13:19,667 --> 00:13:22,000
WILL YOU HELP ME
MAKE HISTORY, BOLIN?

284
00:13:24,917 --> 00:13:28,166
- HMM. I'LL STAND BY YOU.

285
00:13:28,208 --> 00:13:29,375
- THANK YOU.

286
00:13:29,417 --> 00:13:31,458
- WE NEED TO TALK.

287
00:13:33,417 --> 00:13:36,583
- CAN YOU GIVE US
THE ROOM, PLEASE?

288
00:13:39,875 --> 00:13:41,458
- I MET WITH THE WORLD LEADERS,

289
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:43,750
AND I'VE COME
AS THEIR REPRESENTATIVE.

290
00:13:43,792 --> 00:13:46,625
- SO NOW YOU'RE TAKING
AN INTEREST IN WORLD AFFAIRS?

291
00:13:46,667 --> 00:13:48,625
A LITTLE LATE, ISN'T IT?

292
00:13:48,667 --> 00:13:51,041
WHEN THE QUEEN FELL
AND EVERYONE WAS ASKING YOU

293
00:13:51,083 --> 00:13:53,917
TO HELP KEEP THE EARTH KINGDOM
FROM FALLING APART,

294
00:13:53,959 --> 00:13:56,041
ALL YOU WANTED TO DO
WAS HIDE IN ZAOFU

295
00:13:56,083 --> 00:13:58,375
AND LET OTHERS DEAL
WITH THE CONSEQUENCES.

296
00:13:58,417 --> 00:14:01,208
- THAT'S HARDLY FAIR.
I DIDN'T WANT TO SEIZE POWER

297
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:03,583
FOR MYSELF, WHICH IS
WHAT YOU'VE DONE.

298
00:14:03,625 --> 00:14:06,709
I'M TELLING YOU,
FOR THE GOOD OF EVERYONE,

299
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:08,208
YOU HAVE TO STEP DOWN.

300
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:10,250
- I STEPPED<i> UP.</i>

301
00:14:10,291 --> 00:14:12,959
I PROVIDE STABILITY
AND EQUALITY.

302
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:17,125
TELL YOUR WORLD LEADERS TO STAY
OUT OF EARTH EMPIRE BUSINESS.

303
00:14:17,166 --> 00:14:20,208
WE WON'T ACCEPT
THEIR HAND-PICKED DICTATOR.

304
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:22,291
- WHAT MAKES YOU SO DIFFERENT?

305
00:14:22,333 --> 00:14:24,041
YOU'RE JUST ANOTHER TYRANT.

306
00:14:24,083 --> 00:14:26,417
AND DON'T PRETEND THE PEOPLE
PUT YOU WHERE YOU ARE.

307
00:14:26,458 --> 00:14:28,000
I KNOW WHAT HAPPENS TO CITIES
WHO DON'T WANT

308
00:14:28,041 --> 00:14:29,583
TO HAND OVER CONTROL TO YOU.

309
00:14:29,625 --> 00:14:33,333
- THEN YOU KNOW WHAT'S COMING
FOR ZAOFU.

310
00:14:37,667 --> 00:14:40,291
- FIRST I LOSE MY SUITE,
THEN I LOSE MY THRONE.

311
00:14:40,333 --> 00:14:43,208
MY ROYAL BROOCH IS A LIE!

312
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:44,875
I KNOW YOU MUST BE CRUSHED,

313
00:14:44,917 --> 00:14:47,583
NOT GETTING TO COME BACK
TO BA SING SE WITH ME.

314
00:14:47,625 --> 00:14:50,583
- DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME.
I'LL FIND A WAY TO MAKE IT.

315
00:14:50,625 --> 00:14:54,625
- GOOD OL' MAKO,
MY BIG TOUGH GUY.

316
00:14:54,667 --> 00:14:57,750
UGH.
OKAY, I JUST HAVE TO GO ON,

317
00:14:57,792 --> 00:15:00,375
MOVE FORWARD,
TAKE DECISIVE ACTION.

318
00:15:00,417 --> 00:15:02,375
LET'S GO SHOPPING!

319
00:15:02,417 --> 00:15:03,542
[knock at the door]

320
00:15:08,417 --> 00:15:10,041
UGH. GET RID OF HIM.

321
00:15:10,083 --> 00:15:11,125
HE'S WITH HER.

322
00:15:11,166 --> 00:15:13,542
- HE'S MY BROTHER.

323
00:15:13,583 --> 00:15:15,917
- INTERESTING CEREMONY, HUH?

324
00:15:15,959 --> 00:15:17,709
- YOU AREN'T GOING TO KEEP
WORKING FOR KUVIRA

325
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:19,208
NOW THAT SHE'S GOING
AGAINST THE WISHES

326
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:20,750
OF THE ENTIRE WORLD, ARE YOU?

327
00:15:20,792 --> 00:15:23,375
- YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.
KUVIRA IS HELPING OUT

328
00:15:23,417 --> 00:15:25,041
ALL THE POOR PEOPLE
IN THE EARTH EMPIRE,

329
00:15:25,083 --> 00:15:27,208
PEOPLE LIKE OUR FAMILY.
THIS IS FOR THE BEST.

330
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:29,375
- I DON'T KNOW, BRO.

331
00:15:29,417 --> 00:15:31,667
- OKAY, WHY DON'T YOU COME WITH
ME, AND YOU'LL SEE FOR YOURSELF?

332
00:15:31,709 --> 00:15:33,834
WE'VE DONE A LOT OF GOOD,
AND VARRICK IS WORKING ON

333
00:15:33,875 --> 00:15:36,333
SOME NEW INNOVATIONS.
WE'RE MAKING HISTORY.

334
00:15:36,375 --> 00:15:38,709
- BY CRUSHING ANYONE
WHO GETS IN YOUR WAY?

335
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:40,875
- THAT WAS JUST
SOME TOUGH RHETORIC

336
00:15:40,917 --> 00:15:43,041
TO LET THE PEOPLE KNOW
THAT WE MEAN BUSINESS.

337
00:15:43,083 --> 00:15:45,834
I MEAN, KUVIRA IS BASICALLY
JUST LIKE KORRA...

338
00:15:45,875 --> 00:15:47,208
SHE MIGHT SEEM HARD
TO DEAL WITH,

339
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:49,709
BUT IT'S JUST BECAUSE
SHE'S SO PASSIONATE

340
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:51,458
AND BELIEVES IN
WHAT SHE'S DOING.

341
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:53,417
- IT SEEMS LIKE
SHE'S JUST A DICTATOR

342
00:15:53,458 --> 00:15:55,083
WHO'S TAKING THE EARTH KINGDOM
BY FORCE.

343
00:15:55,125 --> 00:15:56,917
- OH, OKAY, SO YOU THINK
YOUR NEW BEST FRIEND IN THERE

344
00:15:56,959 --> 00:15:59,458
WOULD BE A BETTER LEADER
THAN KUVIRA?

345
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,625
- WELL, NO, BUT STILL--
- STILL WHAT?

346
00:16:01,667 --> 00:16:03,208
COME ON, MAKO, I'M MAKING
A DIFFERENCE OUT THERE.

347
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:04,625
WHAT ARE YOU DOIN', HUH?

348
00:16:04,667 --> 00:16:06,291
YOU'RE JUST
SOME GLORIFIED BUTLER

349
00:16:06,333 --> 00:16:08,458
FOR SOME SNOTTY, RICH BOZO.

350
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:10,083
- I'M SORRY.
I DON'T WANT TO WORK FOR

351
00:16:10,125 --> 00:16:13,083
YOUR GLORIOUS EMPEROR IN
HER MILITARY DICTATORSHIP.

352
00:16:13,125 --> 00:16:14,542
- FINE!

353
00:16:14,583 --> 00:16:15,750
I'M GONNA GO BACK
TO MY AWESOME TRAIN,

354
00:16:15,792 --> 00:16:18,041
WHERE WE BRING FREEDOM
WHEREVER WE GO.

355
00:16:18,083 --> 00:16:22,542
ENJOY LICKING THE KING'S BOOTS
IN YOUR<i> JUNIOR SUITE!</i>

356
00:16:29,333 --> 00:16:31,291
- SORRY, SPORT.
I HEARD IT ALL.

357
00:16:31,333 --> 00:16:32,792
- CAN'T BELIEVE HIM!

358
00:16:32,834 --> 00:16:35,291
- I KNOW!
INSULTING ANOTHER MAN'S SUITE?

359
00:16:35,333 --> 00:16:36,792
IT'S BENEATH LOW.

360
00:16:36,834 --> 00:16:38,917
BUT I THINK I KNOW
WHAT WOULD CHEER YOU UP...

361
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:41,417
A VISIT TO LITTLE BA SING SE
FASHION MALL!

362
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:42,417
I'LL BUY YOU A SMOOTHIE.

363
00:16:42,458 --> 00:16:44,875
- YEAH. OKAY.

364
00:16:46,291 --> 00:16:47,375
- THAT WAS TERRIBLE.

365
00:16:47,417 --> 00:16:49,166
- HA! MAYBE FOR YOU.

366
00:16:49,208 --> 00:16:51,208
I HAD A GREAT TIME!

367
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:55,083
I NEVER REALIZED HOW MUCH
I MISSED TORMENTING THE AVATAR.

368
00:16:55,125 --> 00:16:57,041
I WISH YOU WERE PUTTING UP
MORE OF A FIGHT.

369
00:16:57,083 --> 00:16:58,834
BUT IT WAS STILL FUN.

370
00:16:58,875 --> 00:17:02,458
- YOU WERE TOSSING ME AROUND
LIKE A RAG DOLL ALL DAY LONG.

371
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:06,083
- I KNOW!
AND I'M AN OLD LADY.

372
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:08,083
IMAGINE ME IN MY PRIME.

373
00:17:08,125 --> 00:17:12,542
HA-HA!
I WOULD HAVE DESTROYED YOU!

374
00:17:12,583 --> 00:17:15,000
- I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHY I CAN'T GET BACK

375
00:17:15,041 --> 00:17:17,166
TO MY FORMER SELF.
IT'S LIKE...

376
00:17:17,208 --> 00:17:19,041
I'M A STEP SLOWER.
I'M TENTATIVE.

377
00:17:19,083 --> 00:17:20,208
I'M OUT OF SYNC.

378
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:22,250
I JUST CAN'T GET BACK
IN THE GROOVE.

379
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:24,291
- PROBABLY CARRYING AROUND
THAT METAL DOESN'T HELP.

380
00:17:24,333 --> 00:17:26,000
- WHAT METAL?

381
00:17:26,041 --> 00:17:29,375
- THE LITTLE BITS OF METAL
POISON STUCK IN YOUR BODY.

382
00:17:29,417 --> 00:17:32,041
ARE YOU TRYING TO TELL ME
YOU CAN'T FEEL METAL

383
00:17:32,083 --> 00:17:33,667
IN YOUR OWN BODY?

384
00:17:33,709 --> 00:17:36,333
YOU REALLY ARE
THE WORST AVATAR EVER.

385
00:17:36,375 --> 00:17:38,250
- I THOUGHT SU GOT IT ALL OUT.

386
00:17:38,291 --> 00:17:40,583
- NO, MY GIRLS NEVER REALLY
PICKED UP METALBENDING

387
00:17:40,625 --> 00:17:42,375
ALL THAT WELL,
IF YOU ASK ME.

388
00:17:42,417 --> 00:17:45,125
- THAT'S BEEN MY PROBLEM
THIS ENTIRE TIME!

389
00:17:45,166 --> 00:17:46,125
I GOTTA GET IT OUT.

390
00:17:46,166 --> 00:17:48,000
YOU CAN GET IT OUT
FOR ME, RIGHT?

391
00:17:48,041 --> 00:17:49,875
- WHO DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE TALKING TO?

392
00:17:53,458 --> 00:17:55,750
- ONCE WE'RE DONE WITH THESE,
WE CAN GO INTO THE MIDDLE RING

393
00:17:55,792 --> 00:17:57,291
AND I'LL LET YOU
PICK OUT SOME NEW SUITS.

394
00:17:57,333 --> 00:18:00,750
THEN WE'LL HIT THE BOUTIQUES
IN THE UPPER RING FOR ME.

395
00:18:04,709 --> 00:18:07,417
WHERE DID YOU GET THOSE SHIRTS?

396
00:18:07,458 --> 00:18:09,500
- ACES, RIGHT?
KUVIRA IS MY HERO.

397
00:18:09,542 --> 00:18:11,375
- THEY'RE SELLING THEM
OVER THERE.

398
00:18:13,333 --> 00:18:15,166
- [whiney squeal]

399
00:18:15,208 --> 00:18:17,041
- YOU CAN'T SELL THAT JUNK
IN HERE!

400
00:18:17,083 --> 00:18:18,792
THIS IS THE LITTLE BA SING SE
FASHION MALL,

401
00:18:18,834 --> 00:18:20,125
AND I'M THE LITTLE KING HERE!

402
00:18:20,166 --> 00:18:21,250
RESPECT THE BROOCH!

403
00:18:21,291 --> 00:18:25,458
[crowd booing]
- STOP IT, LITTLE KING!

404
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,875
- I AM THE GLORIOUS DEFENDER!

405
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:31,792
- I'M COVERED IN JUICE!
GET HIM!

406
00:18:31,834 --> 00:18:33,208
- WE NEED TO GET YOU
OUT OF HERE.

407
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:34,834
- OOH!

408
00:18:55,083 --> 00:18:56,792
[gasps]
IT'S DESTINY!

409
00:18:56,834 --> 00:18:59,458
LOOK WHERE WE ARE, MAKO...

410
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:02,000
THE ROYAL PALACE.

411
00:19:05,834 --> 00:19:08,458
THE THRONE!

412
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:11,625
OUT OF MY WAY!

413
00:19:11,667 --> 00:19:13,709
- HEY!
IT'S MY BIRTHDAY!

414
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:15,250
- IT'S MY CORONATION DAY!

415
00:19:15,291 --> 00:19:17,000
YOU'LL HAVE ANOTHER BIRTHDAY
NEXT YEAR,

416
00:19:17,041 --> 00:19:19,375
BUT I'LL NEVER HAVE
THIS DAY BACK AGAIN!

417
00:19:19,417 --> 00:19:21,041
NEVER!
[crying]

418
00:19:21,083 --> 00:19:23,083
- OKAY, YOU'RE LOSING IT.

419
00:19:23,125 --> 00:19:26,500
- THIS IS THE WORST DAY
OF MY LIFE!

420
00:19:26,542 --> 00:19:29,208
[cries]
- WHY?

421
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:31,291
DO YOU REALLY WANT
TO BE THE KING?

422
00:19:31,333 --> 00:19:33,625
I MEAN, KUVIRA MIGHT BE
A POWER-CRAZED DICTATOR,

423
00:19:33,667 --> 00:19:36,000
BUT AT LEAST SHE SPENT
THE LAST FEW YEARS WORKING HARD

424
00:19:36,041 --> 00:19:37,500
TO MAKE THE EARTH KINGDOM
SOMEWHAT BETTER.

425
00:19:37,542 --> 00:19:39,458
IF YOU WERE
AN EARTH KINGDOM CITIZEN,

426
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:42,000
DO YOU THINK YOU'RE THE KIND OF
PERSON YOU WANT AS YOUR KING?

427
00:19:42,041 --> 00:19:46,166
WHAT HAVE YOU EVER DONE
FOR YOUR PEOPLE?

428
00:19:46,208 --> 00:19:48,959
I'M SORRY.
THAT WAS OUT OF LINE.

429
00:19:49,041 --> 00:19:50,959
- NO.
YOU'RE RIGHT.

430
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,208
NO ONE EVER TALKED TO ME
LIKE THAT BEFORE.

431
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:56,875
I GUESS I'M JUST A JOKE
WHO GOT WHAT HE DESERVED.

432
00:19:58,667 --> 00:20:01,583
- LET'S GET YOU OUT OF HERE
AND BACK TO SOME PLACE SAFE.

433
00:20:01,625 --> 00:20:04,041
- CARRY ME?
- NO.

434
00:20:04,083 --> 00:20:06,667
- OKAY. IF YOU WANT ME TO
BEND OUT THIS METAL,

435
00:20:06,709 --> 00:20:08,542
YOU NEED TO RELAX.

436
00:20:08,583 --> 00:20:10,375
- I<i> AM</i> RELAXED.

437
00:20:10,417 --> 00:20:12,083
- HA! SERIOUSLY?

438
00:20:12,125 --> 00:20:14,375
YOUR BODY IS LIKE
A TWISTED TREE TRUNK.

439
00:20:14,417 --> 00:20:17,041
- JUST DO IT!
I'M READY!

440
00:20:28,625 --> 00:20:30,083
[grunts]

441
00:20:30,125 --> 00:20:32,500
- IT WOULDN'T HURT
IF YOU WOULD JUST RELAX!

442
00:20:32,542 --> 00:20:33,875
STOP FIGHTING ME!

443
00:20:33,917 --> 00:20:37,000
- I'M NOT FIGHTING!

444
00:20:49,792 --> 00:20:51,834
YA!
- ALL RIGHT, THAT'S IT.

445
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:53,875
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO
DO THIS YOURSELF.

446
00:20:53,917 --> 00:20:56,625
CLEARLY, YOU WANT TO
KEEP THE METAL IN THERE.

447
00:20:56,667 --> 00:20:57,959
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

448
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,792
WHY WOULD I WANT
POISON INSIDE ME?

449
00:21:00,834 --> 00:21:03,583
- I DON'T KNOW.
MAYBE SO YOU HAVE AN EXCUSE

450
00:21:03,625 --> 00:21:05,625
NOT TO GO BACK TO
BEING THE AVATAR.

451
00:21:05,667 --> 00:21:07,750
IF YOU DON'T GET BETTER,
YOU CAN'T DO YOUR JOB,

452
00:21:07,792 --> 00:21:10,959
SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY
ABOUT GETTING HURT AGAIN.

453
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,291
- WHAT?
THAT'S RIDICULOUS.

454
00:21:13,333 --> 00:21:15,583
- WHATEVER.
WHEN YOU WANT IT OUT,

455
00:21:15,625 --> 00:21:17,125
YOU CAN BEND IT OUT.

456
00:21:17,166 --> 00:21:20,208
I CAN'T DEAL WITH
ALL YOUR ISSUES FOR YOU.

457
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:23,417
- WAIT!
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO NOW?

458
00:21:23,458 --> 00:21:24,750
- HOW SHOULD I KNOW?

459
00:21:24,792 --> 00:21:27,083
ASK THE SPIRIT
THAT BROUGHT YOU HERE.

460
00:21:27,125 --> 00:21:30,458
THE GOOD NEWS IS, IF YOU'RE
LOOKING FOR A PLACE TO HANG

461
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:32,333
WHERE NO ONE WILL BOTHER YOU,

462
00:21:32,375 --> 00:21:36,083
YOU PICKED THE BEST SWAMP
IN THE WORLD!

463
00:21:37,959 --> 00:21:40,959
- THIS IS A MISSION
OF THE UTMOST IMPORTANCE.

464
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,917
CONFLICT IS COMING
TO THE EARTH KINGDOM,

465
00:21:42,959 --> 00:21:45,375
AND WE NEED TO FIND THE AVATAR.

466
00:21:45,417 --> 00:21:49,583
CAN I COUNT ON YOU THREE
TO BRING KORRA HOME?

467
00:21:49,625 --> 00:21:51,875
- YOU CAN COUNT ON ONE OF US.

468
00:21:51,917 --> 00:21:55,458
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT
THESE TWO LADIES.

469
00:22:09,208 --> 00:22:11,834
- FROM NOW ON,
DEVELOPING THIS TECHNOLOGY IS

470
00:22:11,875 --> 00:22:13,834
YOUR NUMBER ONE PRIORITY.

471
00:22:13,875 --> 00:22:17,792
- THIS IS GOING TO
CHANGE EVERYTHING.
