BUT I'M OVER IT.

182
00:08:29,625 --> 00:08:30,667
I DON'T THINK
IT MEANT ANYTHING.

183
00:08:30,709 --> 00:08:34,750
- I DOUBT THAT.

184
00:08:34,792 --> 00:08:37,709
[roaring engine approaches]

185
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:38,917
- HIDE!

186
00:08:38,959 --> 00:08:41,709
[tires squeal]

187
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:43,417
[engine slows]

188
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:14,917
- THAT TRAM GOES
TO THE TRAINING CAMP.

189
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:18,625
- EVERYTHING WAS DELIVERED
TO THE PRISON, SIR.

190
00:09:18,667 --> 00:09:20,583
- THAT'S WHERE THEY MUST BE
KEEPING KORRA.

191
00:09:20,625 --> 00:09:23,291
- WE NEED TO GET
DOWN THAT TUNNEL.

192
00:09:35,291 --> 00:09:37,208
[alarm buzzes]

193
00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:47,750
- IT'S EMPTY.
- YEAH, I CAN SEE THAT.

194
00:09:47,792 --> 00:09:50,041
both: AGH!

195
00:09:50,083 --> 00:09:53,166
[footsteps approach]

196
00:09:53,208 --> 00:09:54,750
- YOU TWO,
KEEP AN EYE ON THEM.

197
00:09:54,792 --> 00:09:56,458
[sword blade slashes]

198
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:02,083
MY OFFICERS ARE INSIDE.

199
00:10:02,125 --> 00:10:04,166
- WHAT ABOUT KORRA?

200
00:10:04,208 --> 00:10:07,375
- I DON'T SEE HER YET.

201
00:10:21,542 --> 00:10:23,792
- AVATAR KORRA--
WHERE ARE YOU KEEPING HER?

202
00:10:30,208 --> 00:10:32,750
- CHIEF BEIFONG?

203
00:10:32,792 --> 00:10:34,834
- I'M TOO LATE.

204
00:10:34,875 --> 00:10:39,000
THAT MONSTER ALREADY TOOK
YOUR BENDING, DIDN'T HE?

205
00:10:39,041 --> 00:10:41,166
I'M SO SORRY.

206
00:10:41,208 --> 00:10:45,208
COME ON.
LET'S GET YOU OUT OF HERE.

207
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:47,041
- I'LL ASK YOU
ONE MORE TIME.

208
00:10:47,083 --> 00:10:48,750
WHERE IS SHE?

209
00:10:48,792 --> 00:10:50,333
- WE DON'T HAVE THE AVATAR.

210
00:10:50,375 --> 00:10:52,166
AND THE EQUALISTS DIDN'T ATTACK
CITY HALL.

211
00:10:52,208 --> 00:10:53,417
TARRLOK'S LYING.

212
00:10:53,458 --> 00:10:54,583
- WHAT?
- [gasps]

213
00:10:54,625 --> 00:10:56,250
- I SCANNED
THE ENTIRE PRISON.

214
00:10:56,291 --> 00:10:57,417
KORRA'S NOT HERE.

215
00:10:57,458 --> 00:10:59,291
- WHY WOULD TARRLOK
MAKE UP A STORY

216
00:10:59,333 --> 00:11:00,917
ABOUT GETTING ATTACKED?

217
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:03,000
- BECAUSE HE HAS KORRA.

218
00:11:03,041 --> 00:11:04,250
HE FOOLED US ALL.

219
00:11:04,291 --> 00:11:07,959
[alarm blaring]

220
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,667
- LET'S GO, PEOPLE!

221
00:11:29,125 --> 00:11:31,375
TRY TO CHI-BLOCK THAT,
FOOLS!

222
00:11:37,375 --> 00:11:40,792
- WE GOT MORE COMPANY.

223
00:11:40,834 --> 00:11:42,625
[metal creaks]

224
00:11:42,667 --> 00:11:45,250
HANG ON!

225
00:11:51,959 --> 00:11:53,875
[all groaning]

226
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,500
- YAKONE HAS RULED
REPUBLIC CITY'S CRIMINAL EMPIRE

227
00:12:07,542 --> 00:12:08,500
FOR YEARS.

228
00:12:08,542 --> 00:12:10,166
YET HE HAS ALWAYS MANAGED
TO STAY

229
00:12:10,208 --> 00:12:13,125
OUT OF THE LAW'S REACH
UNTIL NOW.

230
00:12:13,166 --> 00:12:16,792
YOU WILL HEAR TESTIMONY
FROM DOZENS OF HIS VICTIMS.

231
00:12:16,834 --> 00:12:20,125
AND THEY WILL TELL YOU
YAKONE HAS MAINTAINED

232
00:12:20,166 --> 00:12:21,709
HIS GRIP ON THE UNDERWORLD

233
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:26,750
BY USING AN ABILITY THAT
HAS BEEN ILLEGAL FOR DECADES--

234
00:12:26,792 --> 00:12:30,208
BLOODBENDING.

235
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:33,583
- THE PROSECUTION'S
ENTIRE CASE

236
00:12:33,625 --> 00:12:36,709
IS BUILT UPON
THE MAKE-BELIEVE NOTION

237
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:40,125
THAT MY CLIENT IS ABLE
TO BLOODBEND AT WILL,

238
00:12:40,166 --> 00:12:42,625
AT ANY TIME,
ON ANY DAY.

239
00:12:42,667 --> 00:12:45,000
I REMIND THE COUNCIL
THAT BLOODBENDING

240
00:12:45,041 --> 00:12:47,750
IS AN INCREDIBLY RARE SKILL,

241
00:12:47,792 --> 00:12:50,917
AND IT CAN ONLY BE PERFORMED
DURING A FULL MOON.

242
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:53,000
YET THE WITNESSES
WILL CLAIM

243
00:12:53,041 --> 00:12:56,709
THAT MY CLIENT USED BLOODBENDING
AT EVERY OTHER TIME

244
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:59,417
<i>EXCEPT</i> DURING A FULL MOON.

245
00:12:59,458 --> 00:13:01,542
IT WOULD BE A MOCKERY
OF JUSTICE

246
00:13:01,583 --> 00:13:03,333
TO CONVICT A MAN
OF A CRIME

247
00:13:03,375 --> 00:13:06,583
THAT IS IMPOSSIBLE
TO COMMIT.

248
00:13:14,709 --> 00:13:17,291
- COUNCILMAN SOKKA
WILL NOW DELIVER THE VERDICT.

249
00:13:17,333 --> 00:13:18,959
- IN MY YEARS,

250
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,583
I HAVE ENCOUNTERED
PEOPLE BORN

251
00:13:20,625 --> 00:13:23,333
WITH RARE AND UNIQUE
BENDING ABILITIES.

252
00:13:23,375 --> 00:13:25,625
I ONCE BESTED A MAN
WITH MY TRUSTY BOOMERANG

253
00:13:25,667 --> 00:13:29,208
WHO WAS ABLE TO FIREBEND
WITH HIS MIND.

254
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:31,417
WHY, EVEN METALBENDING
WAS CONSIDERED IMPOSSIBLE

255
00:13:31,458 --> 00:13:33,041
FOR ALL OF HISTORY,

256
00:13:33,083 --> 00:13:35,208
UNTIL OUR ESTEEMED
CHIEF OF POLICE,

257
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:36,667
TOPH BEIFONG,

258
00:13:36,709 --> 00:13:38,834
SINGLE-HANDEDLY DEVELOPED
THE SKILL.

259
00:13:38,875 --> 00:13:41,834
THE OVERWHELMING AMOUNT
OF TESTIMONY AND EVIDENCE

260
00:13:41,875 --> 00:13:43,834
HAS CONVINCED THIS COUNCIL

261
00:13:43,875 --> 00:13:46,667
THAT YAKONE IS ONE
OF THESE UNIQUE BENDERS.

262
00:13:46,709 --> 00:13:48,375
AND HE EXPLOITED
HIS ABILITY

263
00:13:48,417 --> 00:13:50,500
TO COMMIT
THESE HEINOUS CRIMES.

264
00:13:50,542 --> 00:13:54,959
WE FIND YAKONE GUILTY
OF ALL CHARGES

265
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,625
AND SENTENCE HIM
TO LIFE IN PRISON.

266
00:13:57,667 --> 00:14:00,125
[gavel bangs]

267
00:14:00,166 --> 00:14:01,375
- HMPH!

268
00:14:01,417 --> 00:14:03,333
[indistinct murmuring]

269
00:14:07,917 --> 00:14:10,333
- [groaning]

270
00:14:17,417 --> 00:14:20,917
- [groaning]

271
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:23,333
- [laughing]

272
00:14:29,125 --> 00:14:30,667
- [breathing shakily]

273
00:14:35,667 --> 00:14:37,291
- THANK YOU ALL FOR MEETING US
ON SUCH SHORT NOTICE.

274
00:14:37,333 --> 00:14:39,333
- CHIEF.
- LIN.

275
00:14:39,375 --> 00:14:40,834
[footsteps approach]

276
00:14:40,875 --> 00:14:42,166
- HAVE YOU NEWS
OF AVATAR KORRA?

277
00:14:42,208 --> 00:14:45,000
- WE DO.
YOU KIDNAPPED HER, TARRLOK!

278
00:14:45,041 --> 00:14:47,000
- I AM SHOCKED
YOU WOULD ACCUSE ME

279
00:14:47,041 --> 00:14:48,917
OF SUCH AN EVIL ACT.

280
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:50,417
I ALREADY EXPLAINED.

281
00:14:50,458 --> 00:14:52,208
EQUALISTS ATTACKED US
AND TOOK HER.

282
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:55,125
- BUT THERE WERE NO CHI-BLOCKERS
HERE LAST NIGHT.

283
00:14:55,166 --> 00:14:56,792
YOU PLANTED THE EVIDENCE,
DIDN'T YOU?

284
00:14:56,834 --> 00:14:59,375
- THAT IS A RIDICULOUS
ACCUSATION!

285
00:14:59,417 --> 00:15:02,166
- IT'S TRUE!
HE TOOK HER!

286
00:15:02,208 --> 00:15:04,750
I WAS HERE WHEN AVATAR KORRA
ARRIVED LAST NIGHT,

287
00:15:04,792 --> 00:15:07,625
BUT COUNCILMAN TARRLOK
ORDERED ME TO LEAVE.

288
00:15:07,667 --> 00:15:09,125
I WAS ON MY WAY OUT
WHEN I SAW TARRLOK

289
00:15:09,166 --> 00:15:11,333
BRING HER DOWN
TO THE GARAGE.

290
00:15:11,375 --> 00:15:14,291
- SAY GOOD-BYE TO REPUBLIC CITY,
AVATAR KORRA.

291
00:15:14,333 --> 00:15:15,750
YOU'LL NEVER SEE IT AGAIN.

292
00:15:15,792 --> 00:15:17,709
- [screams]

293
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
- THAT IS NONSENSE.

294
00:15:24,041 --> 00:15:26,917
EVERYONE KNOWS YOU'RE NOTHING
BUT A SQUEAKY-VOICED LIAR.

295
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:28,792
- WHY DID YOU WAIT UNTIL NOW
TO 'FESS UP?

296
00:15:28,834 --> 00:15:31,417
- I WAS TERRIFIED
TO TELL BECAUSE--

297
00:15:31,458 --> 00:15:33,208
BECAUSE TARRLOK
IS A BLOODBENDER!

298
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:35,291
HE BLOODBENT AVATAR KORRA!

299
00:15:35,333 --> 00:15:38,041
- DON'T MAKE THIS
WORSE FOR YOURSELF.

300
00:15:38,083 --> 00:15:40,750
TELL US WHERE
YOU HAVE KORRA.

301
00:15:46,583 --> 00:15:48,250
all: [groaning]

302
00:16:06,333 --> 00:16:08,834
[footsteps approach]

303
00:16:08,875 --> 00:16:09,875
- WAKE UP.

304
00:16:09,917 --> 00:16:12,667
- OH!

305
00:16:12,709 --> 00:16:14,750
- OH, MAN.

306
00:16:14,792 --> 00:16:16,375
I HAD THIS AWFUL DREAM
THAT KORRA WAS TAKEN

307
00:16:16,417 --> 00:16:17,792
BY THIS EVIL BLOODBENDER.

308
00:16:17,834 --> 00:16:19,458
SO WEIRD.

309
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:20,959
- BOLIN, THAT REALLY HAPPENED.

310
00:16:21,041 --> 00:16:22,083
HE KNOCKED US OUT.

311
00:16:22,125 --> 00:16:23,792
- ARE YOU SERIOUS?
WHERE IS HE?

312
00:16:23,834 --> 00:16:25,000
IS HE HERE RIGHT NOW?

313
00:16:25,041 --> 00:16:26,625
- TARRLOK IS LONG GONE.

314
00:16:26,667 --> 00:16:28,792
I'LL ALERT THE WHOLE FORCE.

315
00:16:28,834 --> 00:16:30,750
- WE'VE ONLY BEEN OUT
FOR A LITTLE WHILE.

316
00:16:30,792 --> 00:16:32,959
MAYBE WE CAN STILL PICK UP
TARRLOK'S TRAIL.

317
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,625
- IT COULD LEAD US
TO KORRA.

318
00:16:34,667 --> 00:16:36,375
LET'S GO.

319
00:16:47,583 --> 00:16:49,250
- [groaning]

320
00:16:59,792 --> 00:17:02,208
[loud groaning]

321
00:17:06,208 --> 00:17:09,542
- YAKONE, YOU WON'T GET AWAY
WITH THIS.

322
00:17:09,583 --> 00:17:11,875
- [laughs]

323
00:17:11,917 --> 00:17:15,083
REPUBLIC CITY IS MINE,
AVATAR.

324
00:17:15,125 --> 00:17:18,291
I'LL BE BACK ONE DAY
TO CLAIM IT.

325
00:17:18,333 --> 00:17:21,542
- [grunts]

326
00:17:21,583 --> 00:17:23,333
[creature screeches]

327
00:17:49,834 --> 00:17:51,500
[wheel squeaking]

328
00:17:54,583 --> 00:17:56,250
[grunting]

329
00:18:00,083 --> 00:18:03,041
- THIS TIME I'M GONNA
PUT YOU TO SLEEP FOR GOOD.

330
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:05,041
- [screams]

331
00:18:14,333 --> 00:18:16,291
- [screaming tensely]

332
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:23,875
- [groans]

333
00:18:23,917 --> 00:18:27,125
- I'M TAKING AWAY YOUR BENDING
FOR GOOD.

334
00:18:27,166 --> 00:18:29,458
- [screams]

335
00:18:34,834 --> 00:18:37,041
- [exhales]

336
00:18:37,083 --> 00:18:41,041
IT'S OVER.

337
00:18:41,083 --> 00:18:43,667
- AANG, THIS WHOLE TIME,

338
00:18:43,709 --> 00:18:45,959
YOU WERE TRYING TO WARN ME
ABOUT TARRLOK.

339
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,250
[door creaks open]

340
00:18:49,291 --> 00:18:52,709
- MY LIFE IS A DISASTER NOW,
THANKS TO YOU.

341
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:56,000
- SO YOUR LITTLE
BLOODBENDING SECRET'S OUT?

342
00:18:56,041 --> 00:18:57,417
- [growls]

343
00:18:57,458 --> 00:18:59,917
- AND I KNOW HOW YOU BLOODBENT
ME WITHOUT A FULL MOON.

344
00:18:59,959 --> 00:19:02,959
YOU'RE YAKONE'S SON.

345
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,333
- I WAS HIS SON.

346
00:19:05,375 --> 00:19:07,333
BUT IN ORDER TO WIN
REPUBLIC CITY,

347
00:19:07,375 --> 00:19:09,792
I HAD TO BECOME
SOMEONE ELSE.

348
00:19:09,834 --> 00:19:12,667
MY FATHER FAILED BECAUSE
HE TRIED TO RULE THE CITY

349
00:19:12,709 --> 00:19:14,709
FROM ITS ROTTEN UNDERBELLY.

350
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:17,667
MY PLAN WAS PERFECT.

351
00:19:17,709 --> 00:19:20,500
I WAS TO BE
THE CITY'S SAVIOR.

352
00:19:20,542 --> 00:19:24,166
BUT YOU--
YOU RUINED EVERYTHING!

353
00:19:24,208 --> 00:19:25,792
- TARRLOK, THE JIG IS UP,

354
00:19:25,834 --> 00:19:27,083
AND YOU HAVE NOWHERE
TO GO.

355
00:19:27,125 --> 00:19:29,375
- OH, NO.

356
00:19:29,417 --> 00:19:32,041
NO, I'LL ESCAPE
