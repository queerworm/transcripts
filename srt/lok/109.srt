Korra's not here.

PROSECUTOR: Yakone has ruled

179
00:11:56,463 --> 00:11:59,223
Republic City's
criminal empire for years.

180
00:11:59,383 --> 00:12:02,593
Yet he has always managed
to stay out of the law's reach,

181
00:12:02,678 --> 00:12:04,388
until now.

182
00:12:04,388 --> 00:12:07,638
You will hear testimony
from dozens of his victims.

183
00:12:07,725 --> 00:12:09,725
And they will tell you

184
00:12:09,810 --> 00:12:13,020
Yakone has maintained his grip
on the underworld

185
00:12:13,105 --> 00:12:17,395
by using an ability
that has been illegal for decades,

186
00:12:17,818 --> 00:12:19,068
bloodbending.

187
00:12:21,822 --> 00:12:27,412
The prosecution's entire case
is built upon the make-believe notion

188
00:12:27,411 --> 00:12:31,411
that my client is able to bloodbend
at will,

189
00:12:31,415 --> 00:12:33,705
at any time, on any day.

190
00:12:33,792 --> 00:12:34,882
I remind the Council

191
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:38,340
that bloodbending
is an incredibly rare skill,

192
00:12:38,422 --> 00:12:41,592
and it can only be performed
during a full moon.

193
00:12:41,675 --> 00:12:46,215
Yet the witnesses will claim
that my client used bloodbending

194
00:12:46,305 --> 00:12:48,055
at every other time,

195
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:50,390
except during a full moon.

196
00:12:50,476 --> 00:12:52,476
It would be a mockery of justice

197
00:12:52,561 --> 00:12:57,821
to convict a man of a crime
that is impossible to commit.

198
00:13:05,824 --> 00:13:08,454
COURT OFFICER: Councilman Sokka
will now deliver the verdict.

199
00:13:09,328 --> 00:13:11,368
In my years, I have encountered people

200
00:13:11,455 --> 00:13:14,285
born with rare
and unique bending abilities.

201
00:13:14,375 --> 00:13:16,745
I once bested a man
with my trusty boomerang

202
00:13:16,835 --> 00:13:19,835
who was able to firebend with his mind.

203
00:13:20,381 --> 00:13:22,631
Why, even metalbending
was considered impossible

204
00:13:22,716 --> 00:13:24,126
for all of history,

205
00:13:24,218 --> 00:13:27,508
until our esteemed Chief of Police,
Toph Beifong,

206
00:13:27,596 --> 00:13:30,466
single-handedly developed the skill.

207
00:13:30,557 --> 00:13:33,267
The overwhelming amount
of testimony and evidence

208
00:13:33,352 --> 00:13:34,892
has convinced this Council

209
00:13:34,978 --> 00:13:37,938
that Yakone is one
of these unique benders.

210
00:13:38,023 --> 00:13:41,783
And he exploited his ability
to commit these heinous crimes.

211
00:13:42,528 --> 00:13:46,108
We find Yakone guilty of all charges

212
00:13:46,198 --> 00:13:48,828
and sentence him to life in prison.

on such short notice.

00:14:28,866 --> 00:14:30,486
- Chief.
- Lin.

217
00:14:31,744 --> 00:14:33,544
Have you news of Avatar Korra?

218
00:14:33,537 --> 00:14:36,537
We do. You kidnapped her, Tarrlok.

219
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:40,290
I am shocked you would accuse me
of such an evil act.

220
00:14:40,377 --> 00:14:43,547
I already explained,
Equalists attacked us and took her!

221
00:14:43,547 --> 00:14:46,257
But there were no Chi-blockers here
last night.

222
00:14:46,341 --> 00:14:48,091
You planted the evidence, didn't you?

223
00:14:48,177 --> 00:14:50,547
That is a ridiculous accusation!

224
00:14:50,554 --> 00:14:53,474
It's true! He took her!

225
00:14:53,557 --> 00:14:56,387
I was here when Avatar Korra
arrived last night,

226
00:14:56,477 --> 00:14:58,437
but Councilman Tarrlok
ordered me to leave.

227
00:14:58,520 --> 00:14:59,560
I was on my way out

228
00:14:59,563 --> 00:15:01,523
when I saw Tarrlok bring her down
to the garage...

229
00:15:02,316 --> 00:15:05,276
TARRLOK: Say goodbye
to Republic City, Avatar Korra.

230
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:06,740
You'll never see it again.

Everyone knows you're nothing
but a squeaky-voiced liar!

235
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:20,080
Why did you wait until now to fess up?

236
00:15:20,167 --> 00:15:22,457
I was terrified to tell because...

237
00:15:22,544 --> 00:15:24,464
Because Tarrlok is a Bloodbender!

238
00:15:24,546 --> 00:15:26,506
He bloodbent Avatar Korra!

246

that Korra was taken
by this evil Bloodbender.

He knocked us out.

Are you serious? Where is he?
Is he here right now?

250
00:16:13,891 --> 00:16:17,311
Tarrlok is long gone.
I'll alert the whole force.

We've only been out for a little while.

Maybe we can still pick up Tarrlok's trail.

253
00:16:21,899 --> 00:16:24,479
