1
00:00:07,458 --> 00:00:09,291
- EARTH.

2
00:00:09,333 --> 00:00:11,125
FIRE.

3
00:00:11,166 --> 00:00:12,875
AIR.

4
00:00:12,917 --> 00:00:15,083
WATER.

5
00:00:15,125 --> 00:00:19,125
ONLY THE AVATAR CAN MASTER
ALL FOUR ELEMENTS

6
00:00:19,166 --> 00:00:22,333
AND BRING BALANCE
TO THE WORLD.

7
00:00:27,291 --> 00:00:28,917
- KUVIRA HAS DEFEATED THE AVATAR

8
00:00:28,959 --> 00:00:31,417
AND NOW CONTROLS
THE ENTIRE EARTH EMPIRE.

9
00:00:31,458 --> 00:00:33,625
LUCKILY, THE AIRBENDER KIDS
AND OPAL RESCUED KORRA

10
00:00:33,667 --> 00:00:35,208
AND ESCAPED ZAOFU.

11
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:36,917
FOR THE FIRST TIME
IN THREE YEARS,

12
00:00:36,959 --> 00:00:38,458
KORRA WILL FINALLY BE BACK
IN REPUBLIC CITY.

13
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:41,000
MEANWHILE, VARRICK AND BOLIN
ESCAPED FROM BAATAR JR.

14
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:42,458
AND ARE ON THE RUN.

15
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:44,291
BUT WILL THEY MAKE IT
BACK TO THE CITY IN TIME

16
00:00:44,333 --> 00:00:47,041
TO WARN EVERYONE ABOUT KUVIRA'S
NEW SPIRIT ENERGY SUPER WEAPON?

17
00:00:54,667 --> 00:00:57,583
[squeaking]

18
00:01:00,542 --> 00:01:03,458
[groaning]

19
00:01:06,291 --> 00:01:08,583
- NAGA!

20
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,083
I MISSED YOU SO MUCH, GIRL.

21
00:01:28,125 --> 00:01:30,625
- MOM! DAD!
WE'RE BACK!

22
00:01:30,667 --> 00:01:32,208
AND WE GOT KORRA!

23
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:35,458
- WELL, AREN'T YOU A SIGHT
FOR SORE EYES.

24
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:38,041
BUM-JU AND I SURE MISSED YOU.

25
00:01:38,083 --> 00:01:40,083
- IT'S SO GREAT TO SEE YOU
AGAIN, BUMI.

26
00:01:40,125 --> 00:01:41,500
AND YOU TOO, BUM-JU.

27
00:01:41,542 --> 00:01:43,583
[Bum-ju screeches]

28
00:01:43,625 --> 00:01:45,291
- WELL DONE, KIDS.

29
00:01:45,333 --> 00:01:47,542
I'M PROUD OF YOU ALL
FOR FINDING KORRA.

30
00:01:47,583 --> 00:01:50,500
- PROUD ENOUGH
TO GET ME MY TATS?

31
00:01:50,542 --> 00:01:52,000
- NO.

32
00:01:53,333 --> 00:01:54,375
WELCOME HOME.

33
00:01:54,417 --> 00:01:56,375
- I MISSED YOU, TENZIN.

34
00:01:56,417 --> 00:01:58,125
- NOW, I HATE TO GET RIGHT DOWN
TO BUSINESS,

35
00:01:58,166 --> 00:02:01,125
BUT I WANT TO HEAR WHAT HAPPENED
IN ZAOFU.

36
00:02:01,166 --> 00:02:02,000
[Bum-ju squeaks]

37
00:02:02,041 --> 00:02:03,959
- WAY TO RUIN THE MOMENT.

38
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,750
- KUVIRA'S WHOLE ARMY WAS THERE.

39
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:08,291
SHE CAPTURED MOM, DAD,
AND MY BROTHERS.

40
00:02:08,333 --> 00:02:10,959
- I THOUGHT I WAS STRONG ENOUGH
TO STOP HER.

41
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,709
I FEEL LIKE SUCH A FAILURE.

42
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:15,667
- NO ONE EXPECTED YOU
TO HANDLE KUVIRA ON YOUR OWN.

43
00:02:15,709 --> 00:02:20,083
IT'S UP TO ALL OF US
TO FIND A WAY TO DEAL WITH HER.

44
00:02:20,125 --> 00:02:22,291
WE'RE JUST GLAD
TO HAVE YOU BACK.

45
00:02:22,333 --> 00:02:24,083
- WHERE'S BOLIN?

46
00:02:24,125 --> 00:02:26,417
HE'S NOT STILL ON KUVIRA'S SIDE,
IS HE?

47
00:02:26,458 --> 00:02:27,959
- I CAN'T BELIEVE
HE WOULD STAY WITH HER

48
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,875
AFTER WHAT SHE DID TO MY FAMILY.

49
00:02:29,917 --> 00:02:33,166
BUT WE DON'T KNOW WHERE HE IS.

50
00:02:33,208 --> 00:02:35,375
- [panting]

51
00:02:35,417 --> 00:02:37,917
HOW ABOUT YOU USE YOUR OWN LEGS
FOR A WHILE?

52
00:02:37,959 --> 00:02:40,291
- YOU KNOW, WHEN I FLED
REPUBLIC CITY WITH ZHU LI,

53
00:02:40,333 --> 00:02:43,250
SHE CARRIED ME TWENTY MILES
IN ONE DAY.

54
00:02:43,291 --> 00:02:45,125
AND THAT WAS AFTER
SHE SPRAINED HER ANKLE.

55
00:02:45,166 --> 00:02:47,667
- WELL, ZHU LI'S NOT HERE,
OKAY?

56
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:49,125
- THAT'S FINE.

57
00:02:49,166 --> 00:02:51,917
LEAVE ME HERE.
LET THE WORMS GOBBLE ME UP.

58
00:02:51,959 --> 00:02:54,125
I DESERVE IT.
- NO WAY, MISTER.

59
00:02:54,166 --> 00:02:55,792
YOU'RE NOT GETTING OFF
THAT EASILY.

60
00:02:55,834 --> 00:02:58,500
YOU'RE RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT
WEAPON KUVIRA'S TRYING TO MAKE.

61
00:02:58,542 --> 00:03:01,583
WHICH, MAY I REMIND YOU,
COULD HURT A LOT OF PEOPLE.

62
00:03:01,625 --> 00:03:03,000
- NO, DON'T REMIND ME!

63
00:03:03,041 --> 00:03:05,542
I KNOW, I'M A HORRIBLE,
HORRIBLE PERSON.

64
00:03:05,583 --> 00:03:07,125
- OKAY, LOOK,

65
00:03:07,166 --> 00:03:09,166
KUVIRA FOOLED US BOTH
INTO DOING HER DIRTY WORK

66
00:03:09,208 --> 00:03:10,792
AND I'M NOT HAPPY ABOUT IT
EITHER.

67
00:03:10,834 --> 00:03:13,458
BUT YOU KNOW HOW WE'RE GONNA
MAKE IT UP TO THE WORLD?

68
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:15,166
BY GETTING BACK TO REPUBLIC CITY

69
00:03:15,208 --> 00:03:17,083
AND WARNING EVERYONE
WHAT SHE'S UP TO.

70
00:03:17,125 --> 00:03:20,291
SO I WANT YOU TO TAKE MY HAND,

71
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:24,083
AND MARCH WITH ME
OUT OF THIS FOREST!

72
00:03:25,291 --> 00:03:27,208
- YOU REALLY HAVE A WAY
WITH WORDS, KID.

73
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:29,542
NO WONDER I MADE YOU
A MOVER STAR.

74
00:03:29,583 --> 00:03:31,583
ALL RIGHT, I'LL TAKE
THE DRIVER'S SEAT FOR A WHILE.

75
00:03:31,625 --> 00:03:32,583
HOP ON.

76
00:03:32,625 --> 00:03:33,625
- [sighs]
GREAT.

77
00:03:33,667 --> 00:03:35,250
MY FEET COULD USE A BREAK.

78
00:03:35,291 --> 00:03:38,709
- [straining]
OKAY. OH, BOY.

79
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:40,500
HERE WE GO.

80
00:03:40,542 --> 00:03:43,417
[groaning]

81
00:03:43,458 --> 00:03:45,750
- AH!
- OH!

82
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:48,083
- ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

83
00:03:51,625 --> 00:03:53,875
- I HOPE YOU HAVEN'T BEEN
WAITING LONG.

84
00:03:53,917 --> 00:03:57,834
- ONLY THREE YEARS.

85
00:03:57,875 --> 00:03:59,792
IT'S SO GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

86
00:03:59,834 --> 00:04:01,208
- YOU TOO.

87
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:03,250
- AND I'M LOVING THE HAIR.

88
00:04:03,291 --> 00:04:06,417
- THANKS.
YOU'RE LOOKING SNAZZY AS ALWAYS.

89
00:04:06,458 --> 00:04:10,333
- COME ON, MAKO GOT US
A TABLE AT THE RESTAURANT.

90
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:11,417
- KORRA!

91
00:04:11,458 --> 00:04:13,250
- HI, MAKO.

92
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:17,375
- HELLO THERE,
PRINCE WU,

93
00:04:17,417 --> 00:04:20,166
RIGHTFUL HEIR TO THE THRONE,
AND THIS GUY'S BOSS.

94
00:04:20,208 --> 00:04:22,917
[chuckles] I BET HE'S TOLD YOU
A LOT ABOUT ME.

95
00:04:22,959 --> 00:04:24,291
- NOPE.
NOT A THING.

96
00:04:24,333 --> 00:04:27,000
- THEN WE HAVE SO MUCH
TO TALK ABOUT.

97
00:04:27,041 --> 00:04:28,667
YOU ARE GOING TO LOVE
THE FOOD HERE.

98
00:04:28,709 --> 00:04:30,333
I KNOW THE CHEF PERSONALLY.

99
00:04:30,375 --> 00:04:33,291
LET'S START WITH A ROUND
OF YOUR SPICY OCTOPUS FRITTERS.

100
00:04:33,333 --> 00:04:35,583
AND KEEP THE CUCUMBER-ALOE WATER
FLOWING.

101
00:04:35,625 --> 00:04:40,125
GOT TO KEEP THIS PRINCELY SKIN
HYDRATED.

102
00:04:40,166 --> 00:04:42,375
- I THOUGHT IT WAS JUST
GOING TO BE THE THREE OF US.

103
00:04:42,417 --> 00:04:45,125
- SORRY,
I COULDN'T DITCH HIM.

104
00:04:45,166 --> 00:04:47,208
BUT HE PROMISED TO BE ON
HIS BEST BEHAVIOR.

105
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:49,083
- HEY, POP INTO THE AVATAR STATE
FOR ME.

106
00:04:49,125 --> 00:04:50,917
I WANT TO SEE YOUR EYES GLOW.

107
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:52,458
- WHAT?
NO.

108
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:53,709
- [moans]

109
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:56,500
- SO CAN YOU GO INTO THE AVATAR
STATE AGAIN?

110
00:04:56,542 --> 00:04:58,542
I WAS WORRIED WHEN YOU TOLD ME
YOU COULDN'T.

111
00:04:58,583 --> 00:05:00,500
- WAIT.

112
00:05:00,542 --> 00:05:02,333
WHEN DID SHE TELL YOU
SHE COULDN'T?

113
00:05:02,375 --> 00:05:04,125
[straw slurping]

114
00:05:04,166 --> 00:05:06,458
WHAT'S GOING ON WITH YOU TWO?

115
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:08,542
- I WROTE TO ASAMI
WHILE I WAS AWAY.

116
00:05:08,583 --> 00:05:11,375
I ASKED HER NOT TO TELL YOU.
I'M SORRY.

117
00:05:11,417 --> 00:05:12,750
- WELL, WHY DIDN'T YOU EVER
WRITE TO ME?

118
00:05:12,792 --> 00:05:14,333
OR BOLIN?

119
00:05:14,375 --> 00:05:15,458
- I DON'T KNOW.

120
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:18,250
I GUESS I DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT TO SAY.

121
00:05:18,291 --> 00:05:19,417
- A "HELLO" WOULD HAVE BEEN
NICE.

122
00:05:19,458 --> 00:05:21,291
- MAKO, IF IT MAKES YOU
FEEL ANY BETTER,

123
00:05:21,333 --> 00:05:22,750
SHE DIDN'T WRITE ME EITHER.

124
00:05:22,792 --> 00:05:23,875
- WHY WOULD SHE...

125
00:05:23,917 --> 00:05:25,834
[sighs]
NEVER MIND.

126
00:05:25,875 --> 00:05:28,834
- I'M SORRY I DIDN'T STAY
IN TOUCH, BUT I'M BACK NOW.

127
00:05:28,875 --> 00:05:30,375
AND I WANT TO KNOW EVERYTHING

128
00:05:30,417 --> 00:05:32,000
ABOUT WHAT'S BEEN GOING ON
WITH YOU TWO.

129
00:05:32,041 --> 00:05:34,417
- WELL, I KIND OF HAVE
SOME BIG NEWS.

130
00:05:34,458 --> 00:05:37,166
I WENT TO VISIT MY FATHER
FOR THE FIRST TIME.

131
00:05:37,208 --> 00:05:38,792
HE'D BEEN WRITING ME LETTERS

132
00:05:38,834 --> 00:05:42,750
AND I GUESS I FINALLY FELT READY
TO TRY AND FORGIVE HIM.

133
00:05:42,792 --> 00:05:44,375
- YOU SURE YOU CAN TRUST HIM?

134
00:05:44,417 --> 00:05:46,667
HE MIGHT JUST BE
MANIPULATING YOU AGAIN.

135
00:05:46,709 --> 00:05:49,500
- YOU THINK I DON'T KNOW WHAT
MY OWN FATHER IS CAPABLE OF?

136
00:05:49,542 --> 00:05:51,250
- NO.
NO, I DIDN'T MEAN--

137
00:05:51,291 --> 00:05:53,291
- YOU DON'T GET TO DISAPPEAR
FOR THREE YEARS

138
00:05:53,333 --> 00:05:55,333
AND THEN ACT LIKE YOU KNOW
WHAT'S BEST FOR ME.

139
00:05:55,375 --> 00:05:57,583
- IT'S NOT LIKE I PLANNED
TO BE GONE THAT LONG.

140
00:05:57,625 --> 00:06:01,500
I WANTED TO COME BACK, BUT I
NEVER FELT READY UNTIL NOW.

141
00:06:01,542 --> 00:06:03,458
- AS MUCH AS I'M ENJOYING
THIS LITTLE CATCH-UP,

142
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:06,333
MY ROYAL BLADDER
IS ABOUT TO EXPLODE.

143
00:06:06,375 --> 00:06:07,333
MAKO?

144
00:06:07,375 --> 00:06:08,959
COME ON,
I NEED YOU TO STAND GUARD.

145
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,542
- I'M NOT GONNA HOLD YOUR HAND

146
00:06:10,583 --> 00:06:12,458
EVERY TIME YOU HAVE TO EMPTY
YOUR ROYAL BLADDER.

147
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:14,542
GO TO THE BATHROOM ON YOUR OWN
FOR ONCE.

148
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:15,583
- FINE.

149
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:20,458
- DO YOU ALWAYS GO
TO THE BATHROOM WITH HIM?

150
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:22,458
- I DON'T GO "WITH HIM"
WITH HIM.

151
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:25,083
I JUST STAND THERE IN THE
GENERAL VICINITY WHILE HE--

152
00:06:25,125 --> 00:06:27,834
I DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT.

153
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,417
- GOOD AFTERNOON, SIR.

154
00:06:32,458 --> 00:06:34,834
PERHAPS A SPRITZ OF COLOGNE
TO FRESHEN UP?

155
00:06:34,875 --> 00:06:36,333
- MAKE IT A DOUBLE, BUDDY.

156
00:06:40,667 --> 00:06:41,834
[coughing]

157
00:06:41,875 --> 00:06:43,417
MAKO, HELP!

158
00:06:43,458 --> 00:06:45,792
WU DOWN.

159
00:06:45,834 --> 00:06:47,709
WU...
DOWN.

160
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:49,166
[groans]

161
00:06:50,583 --> 00:06:52,834
- [grunting]

162
00:06:52,875 --> 00:06:54,625
I WISH PABU WERE HERE.

163
00:06:54,667 --> 00:06:56,333
HE COULD JUST CHEW US
OUT OF THIS.

164
00:06:56,375 --> 00:07:00,083
- YOU KNOW WHO ELSE HAS INCISORS
SHARP AS A KNIFE?

165
00:07:00,125 --> 00:07:02,208
ZHU LI.
[footsteps approaching]

166
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:03,834
- WELL, LOOK WHAT WE CAUGHT.

167
00:07:03,875 --> 00:07:07,834
WONDER IF THEY WERE TRACKING US
AFTER WE ESCAPED.

168
00:07:07,875 --> 00:07:09,542
- HELLO, FELLOW TRAVELERS!

169
00:07:09,583 --> 00:07:12,625
I DON'T SUPPOSE YOU COULD
HELP US OUT OF THIS NET?

170
00:07:12,667 --> 00:07:16,458
- WHY WOULD WE FREE A COUPLE
OF LOWLY EARTH EMPIRE SOLDIERS?

171
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:17,875
- LOWLY?

172
00:07:17,917 --> 00:07:20,333
WE WERE PART OF KUVIRA'S
INNER CIRCLE!

173
00:07:20,375 --> 00:07:21,583
- WERE!
NOT ANYMORE.

174
00:07:21,625 --> 00:07:24,041
WE JUMPED SHIP.
PLEASE JUST LET US OUT.

175
00:07:24,083 --> 00:07:26,083
- I THINK I KNOW JUST WHAT TO DO

176
00:07:26,125 --> 00:07:29,125
WITH A COUPLE OF KUVIRA'S
TOP MEN.

177
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:31,709
snap!

178
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:33,125
- AHH!

179
00:07:36,333 --> 00:07:38,625
- I WONDER WHAT'S TAKING WU
SO LONG.

180
00:07:38,667 --> 00:07:40,875
HE'S NOT ONE TO MISS OUT
ON LUNCH.

181
00:07:40,917 --> 00:07:43,041
I'LL GO CHECK ON HIM.

182
00:07:50,709 --> 00:07:52,417
WU, YOU IN HERE?

183
00:07:52,458 --> 00:07:54,458
COME ON, YOUR OCTOPUS FRITTERS
ARE GETTING COLD.

184
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:57,417
[rattling]

185
00:07:58,959 --> 00:08:01,208
- I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

186
00:08:04,709 --> 00:08:08,208
EXCUSE ME, DID YOU HAPPEN TO SEE
IF PRINCE WU CAME OUT THIS WAY?

187
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:10,125
- SORRY, MISS.
HAVEN'T SEEN HIM.

188
00:08:10,166 --> 00:08:13,709
- HMM.
I'M IN LAUNDRY.

189
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:14,709
- AH!

190
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:16,917
[grunts]

191
00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:17,709
[engine turns over, car starts]

192
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:18,875
[tires squeal]

193
00:08:18,917 --> 00:08:20,250
THEY'VE GOT WU!

194
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:22,250
GET THE CAR,
I'M GOING AFTER THEM.

195
00:08:25,667 --> 00:08:27,125
[tires screech]

196
00:08:34,583 --> 00:08:36,375
- GET IN.

197
00:08:39,834 --> 00:08:41,417
[tires squeal]

198
00:08:45,375 --> 00:08:48,333
- AH!
- AH!

199
00:08:48,375 --> 00:08:49,583
WE'RE LOSING THEM.

200
00:08:49,625 --> 00:08:51,041
- HANG A RIGHT
AT THE NEXT BLOCK.

201
00:08:51,083 --> 00:08:54,458
WE CAN CUT THEM OFF ON SEVENTH.

202
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,417
YOU MISSED THE TURN!
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

203
00:08:56,458 --> 00:08:58,083
- I KNOW THESE STREETS
BETTER THAN YOU.

204
00:08:58,125 --> 00:08:59,750
I BUILT SOME OF THEM.

205
00:09:06,875 --> 00:09:09,542
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
SIT DOWN.

206
00:09:15,709 --> 00:09:19,041
- WHERE IS HE?

207
00:09:19,083 --> 00:09:20,917
- WHOA!

208
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:23,792
[brakes squeal]

209
00:09:25,875 --> 00:09:27,250
- WU'S NOT HERE.

210
00:09:27,291 --> 00:09:29,583
THIS GUY WAS THE ONLY ONE
IN THE TRUCK.

211
00:09:29,625 --> 00:09:30,583
- [grunts]

212
00:09:30,625 --> 00:09:32,333
- WHERE'S THE PRINCE?

213
00:09:32,375 --> 00:09:34,417
- HALFWAY TO KUVIRA BY NOW.

214
00:09:34,458 --> 00:09:35,959
[grunts]

215
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,417
ALL HAIL THE GREAT UNITER.

216
00:09:38,458 --> 00:09:40,625
- THEY MUST HAVE MOVED WU
TO A DIFFERENT VEHICLE

217
00:09:40,667 --> 00:09:41,834
WHEN WE LOST SIGHT OF THEM.

218
00:09:41,875 --> 00:09:43,125
[sirens blaring]

219
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:46,667
- [grunts]

220
00:09:46,709 --> 00:09:48,125
- TAKE THIS GUY IN FOR BOOKING.

221
00:09:48,166 --> 00:09:49,709
CHARGE HIM WITH KIDNAPPING.

222
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:52,125
AND TELL CHIEF BEIFONG
THAT PRINCE WU IS MISSING.

223
00:09:52,166 --> 00:09:53,583
PUT OUT AN ALL POINTS BULLETIN.

224
00:09:53,625 --> 00:09:55,166
WE'LL KEEP LOOKING.

225
00:09:55,208 --> 00:09:56,583
- WHERE DO WE START?

226
00:09:56,625 --> 00:09:58,792
THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF CARS
IN THE CITY

227
00:09:58,834 --> 00:10:00,583
AND HE COULD BE IN
ANY ONE OF THEM.

228
00:10:00,625 --> 00:10:02,709
- OR THEY MIGHT TRY SMUGGLING
HIM OUT ON AN AIRSHIP.

229
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:04,291
- OR MAYBE A BOAT.

230
00:10:04,333 --> 00:10:05,917
- HE COULD BE ANYWHERE!
[groans]

231
00:10:05,959 --> 00:10:09,083
THE ONE TIME I DON'T WATCH HIM
PEE AND THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS.

232
00:10:27,041 --> 00:10:29,125
- THEY'RE TAKING WU
TO THE TRAIN STATION!

233
00:10:29,166 --> 00:10:31,041
- ARE YOU SURE?
HOW DO YOU KNOW?

234
00:10:31,083 --> 00:10:33,166
- I'LL EXPLAIN ON THE WAY,
JUST DRIVE!

235
00:10:33,208 --> 00:10:35,542
WE'RE RUNNING OUT OF TIME!

236
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,500
- SO HOW DID A BUNCH
OF WATER AND FIRE BENDERS

237
00:10:43,542 --> 00:10:46,333
END UP IN ONE OF KUVIRA'S
REEDUCATION CAMPS?

238
00:10:46,375 --> 00:10:48,834
- CALL IT WHAT IT IS--
A PRISON.

239
00:10:48,875 --> 00:10:50,834
- KUVIRA'S BEEN PURGING STATES
OF ANYONE

240
00:10:50,875 --> 00:10:53,625
WHO'S NOT OF EARTH KINGDOM
ORIGIN AND LOCKING THEM UP.

241
00:10:53,667 --> 00:10:54,792
- PURGING?

242
00:10:54,834 --> 00:10:56,458
- WHAT ARE YOU ACTING
SO SURPRISED FOR?

243
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:58,250
YOU MUST HAVE KNOWN
WHAT SHE WAS UP TO,

244
00:10:58,291 --> 00:11:00,625
BEING PART OF HER "INNER CIRCLE"
AND ALL.

245
00:11:00,667 --> 00:11:02,375
- NO, I SWEAR.

246
00:11:02,417 --> 00:11:05,250
AND THE INNER CIRCLE THING
LASTED, LIKE, LESS THAN A DAY.

247
00:11:05,291 --> 00:11:08,125
- WILL YOU AT LEAST TELL US
WHERE YOU'RE TAKING US?

248
00:11:08,166 --> 00:11:09,583
- THE BORDER CHECKPOINT.

249
00:11:09,625 --> 00:11:11,125
YOU'RE GONNA HELP US
TALK OUR WAY PAST

250
00:11:11,166 --> 00:11:12,875
SOME EARTH EMPIRE SOLDIERS.

251
00:11:12,917 --> 00:11:14,083
- AND ONCE WE'RE THROUGH,

252
00:11:14,125 --> 00:11:16,291
WE'LL SEE ABOUT LETTING YOU GO.

253
00:11:19,875 --> 00:11:21,792
[grunting]

254
00:11:24,583 --> 00:11:25,750
- HA HA!

255
00:11:25,792 --> 00:11:28,750
LAVA TIME!
BET YOU DIDN'T EXPECT THAT!

256
00:11:28,792 --> 00:11:31,208
- LOOK, I'M SORRY FOR
WHAT HAPPENED TO ALL OF YOU,

257
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:33,083
BUT AS I'VE BEEN TRYING
TO EXPLAIN,

258
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:35,667
WE DON'T WORK FOR KUVIRA
ANYMORE.

259
00:11:35,709 --> 00:11:38,583
- YEAH, IF OUR HANDSOME MUGS
GET RECOGNIZED

260
00:11:38,625 --> 00:11:40,125
TRYING TO GO THROUGH
THAT CHECKPOINT,

261
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:41,792
WE'RE GONERS!

262
00:11:41,834 --> 00:11:44,250
- IF YOU REALLY ARE FUGITIVES,
YOU BETTER LISTEN UP.

263
00:11:44,291 --> 00:11:46,417
WE'VE BEEN SCOUTING THIS REGION
FOR DAYS.

264
00:11:46,458 --> 00:11:48,875
THERE'S A WALL STRETCHING ALONG
THE ENTIRE BORDER

265
00:11:48,917 --> 00:11:50,709
AND PATROLS GUARDING EVERY PART
OF IT.

266
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:53,041
THAT CHECKPOINT IS OUR ONLY WAY
OUT.

267
00:11:53,083 --> 00:11:55,417
- IT'S NOT WORTH THE RISK,
BARAZ.

268
00:11:55,458 --> 00:11:57,166
HOW DO WE KNOW
THEY WON'T TURN US IN?

269
00:11:57,208 --> 00:11:58,792
- IF HE WANTED US GONE,

270
00:11:58,834 --> 00:12:01,125
WE'D BE AT THE BOTTOM OF A POOL
OF LAVA RIGHT NOW.

271
00:12:01,166 --> 00:12:03,834
IF ANY OF US WANT TO GET OUT
OF THE EARTH EMPIRE ALIVE,

272
00:12:03,875 --> 00:12:06,375
WE'LL HAVE TO TRUST EACH OTHER.

273
00:12:09,625 --> 00:12:12,583
- ALL RIGHT,
WHERE'S THIS CHECKPOINT?

274
00:12:12,625 --> 00:12:14,542
[tires squeal]

275
00:12:14,583 --> 00:12:16,166
- SO HOW DO YOU KNOW WHERE WU IS

276
00:12:16,208 --> 00:12:18,083
JUST BY TOUCHING
SOME SPIRIT VINES?

277
00:12:18,125 --> 00:12:20,500
- I LEARNED HOW TO CONNECT TO
PEOPLE'S ENERGY THROUGH THEM.

278
00:12:20,542 --> 00:12:21,625
- WHO TAUGHT YOU THAT?

279
00:12:21,667 --> 00:12:23,166
- LIN'S MOM.

280
00:12:23,208 --> 00:12:24,583
I FOUND HER IN THE SWAMP.

281
00:12:24,625 --> 00:12:26,917
THAT PLACE IS LIKE
ONE GIANT SPIRIT WILD.

282
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:28,417
- YOU MET TOPH?

283
00:12:28,458 --> 00:12:29,667
WHAT WAS SHE LIKE?

284
00:12:29,709 --> 00:12:32,083
A CRANKY, MORE MISERABLE VERSION
OF LIN.

285
00:12:32,125 --> 00:12:33,917
- IS THAT EVEN POSSIBLE?

286
00:12:33,959 --> 00:12:35,625
- YOU'D BE SURPRISED.

287
00:12:45,959 --> 00:12:47,417
- WHICH TRAIN IS WU ON?

288
00:12:47,458 --> 00:12:48,583
- I DON'T KNOW!

289
00:12:48,625 --> 00:12:50,792
- SPLIT UP AND START LOOKING.

290
00:13:00,291 --> 00:13:03,000
- [whispers]
FOLLOW MY LEAD.

291
00:13:03,041 --> 00:13:05,333
- GOOD AFTERNOON, SIR.
CAN WE HELP YOU?

292
00:13:05,375 --> 00:13:06,667
- YOU SURE CAN.

293
00:13:06,709 --> 00:13:08,125
WE CAPTURED THESE ESCAPED
PRISONERS.

294
00:13:08,166 --> 00:13:09,792
WE NEED TO GET THEM
TO A SECURE FACILITY.

295
00:13:09,834 --> 00:13:12,667
- WHERE'D THEY ESCAPE FROM?
- CAMP 14.

296
00:13:12,709 --> 00:13:14,625
- THEN WHY ARE YOU BRINING
THEM THROUGH HERE?

297
00:13:14,667 --> 00:13:16,333
CAMP 14'S BACK THE OTHER WAY.

298
00:13:16,375 --> 00:13:19,458
- YOU THINK WE DON'T KNOW
WHERE CAMP 14 IS?

299
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,542
KUVIRA WANTS THEM TRANSFERRED.

300
00:13:21,583 --> 00:13:25,041
- THEN I'LL NEED TO SEE
THE TRANSFER ORDER.

301
00:13:25,083 --> 00:13:27,583
- LISTEN, PAL, I HAD TO FIGHT
OFF 2 BADGER-MOLES,

302
00:13:27,625 --> 00:13:30,166
6 WOLF-BATS, AND 18 HOG-MONKEYS
TO GET THESE GUYS.

303
00:13:30,208 --> 00:13:32,083
SO SORRY IF I DON'T HAVE
THE PAPERWORK.

304
00:13:32,125 --> 00:13:34,375
I WAS TOO BUSY CRAMMING IT
IN A HOG-MONKEY'S MOUTH

305
00:13:34,417 --> 00:13:35,750
WHILE IT WAS TRYING TO EAT ME.

306
00:13:35,792 --> 00:13:37,333
I AM IN SORE NEED OF A SHOWER

307
00:13:37,375 --> 00:13:39,291
AND I HAVE BLISTERS THAT ARE
THE SIZE OF CANTALOUPES

308
00:13:39,333 --> 00:13:40,625
AND TWICE AS JUICY!

309
00:13:40,667 --> 00:13:41,667
SO YOU CAN LET US THROUGH,

310
00:13:41,709 --> 00:13:43,125
OR YOU CAN GIVE ME YOUR NAME
AND RANK

311
00:13:43,166 --> 00:13:44,458
AND I'LL PASS IT ON TO KUVIRA.

312
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:45,750
YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS
TO SOLDIERS

313
00:13:45,792 --> 00:13:47,375
WHO QUESTION HER ORDERS,
DON'T YOU?

314
00:13:47,417 --> 00:13:50,667
BAD STUFF!

315
00:13:50,709 --> 00:13:51,834
- LET THEM THROUGH!

316
00:14:08,333 --> 00:14:09,625
- WAIT!
STOP THEM!

317
00:14:09,667 --> 00:14:11,625
THEY'RE TRAITORS TO THE EMPIRE!

318
00:14:23,291 --> 00:14:27,291
- THERE'S NO WAY I'M GOING BACK
TO PRISON!

319
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:28,875
[grunts]

320
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:40,875
- AH. AH!
AH!

321
00:15:03,709 --> 00:15:05,709
- [grunting]

322
00:15:15,166 --> 00:15:17,333
AH!

323
00:15:20,041 --> 00:15:21,500
- AH!

324
00:15:25,083 --> 00:15:26,166
- [laughs]

325
00:15:47,458 --> 00:15:48,875
- [grunts]

326
00:15:59,709 --> 00:16:02,625
[groaning]

327
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:13,125
- BOY, I SURE HOPE THIS WORKS.

328
00:16:22,041 --> 00:16:23,333
[laughs]

329
00:16:23,375 --> 00:16:26,000
I STILL GOT THAT VARRICK TOUCH.

330
00:16:29,417 --> 00:16:32,208
WE'RE CLEAR.
COME ON!

331
00:16:34,125 --> 00:16:37,792
- AH!

332
00:16:37,834 --> 00:16:40,542
- VARRICK, WAIT!
WE CAN'T LEAVE THEM.

333
00:16:44,041 --> 00:16:46,125
- AH!

334
00:16:49,333 --> 00:16:50,542
- RETREAT!

335
00:16:57,375 --> 00:16:59,834
- THANKS.
YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO COME BACK.

336
00:16:59,875 --> 00:17:02,375
- YEAH,
I KIND OF DID.

337
00:17:02,417 --> 00:17:05,667
LET'S GO.

338
00:17:05,709 --> 00:17:08,000
- [over P.A]
THE 4:15 BOUND FOR OMASHU

339
00:17:08,041 --> 00:17:10,333
IS NOW LEAVING
ON TRACK NUMBER SIX.

340
00:17:10,375 --> 00:17:12,792
ALL ABOARD!

341
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:18,250
- IF WE DON'T FIND WU SOON,
WE MIGHT NEVER FIND HIM.

342
00:17:25,375 --> 00:17:27,291
- HE'S ON THAT TRAIN!

343
00:17:31,166 --> 00:17:32,917
- HOW DO YOU KNOW FOR SURE
HE'S HERE?

344
00:17:32,959 --> 00:17:35,667
- I DON'T.
BUT I HAD A FEELING, OKAY?

345
00:17:35,709 --> 00:17:38,083
- AND I'M JUST SUPPOSED TO TRUST
"AVATAR FEELINGS"?

346
00:17:38,125 --> 00:17:40,333
- YOU WOULDN'T HAVE TO
IF YOU HAD GUARDED THE PRINCE

347
00:17:40,375 --> 00:17:43,000
LIKE YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO.

348
00:17:43,041 --> 00:17:45,583
- OH, SO IT'S MY FAULT
WU DISAPPEARED.

349
00:17:45,625 --> 00:17:47,041
- IT'S CERTAINLY NOT MINE!

350
00:17:47,083 --> 00:17:48,250
- GUYS, SHH.

351
00:17:48,291 --> 00:17:52,250
LISTEN.
[pounding]

352
00:17:52,291 --> 00:17:54,166
- [shouting]

353
00:17:54,208 --> 00:17:56,000
- WU!
WU, IT'S ME.

354
00:17:56,041 --> 00:17:58,000
- MAKO?
WHERE AM I?

355
00:17:58,041 --> 00:18:01,583
AM I DEAD?
- NO, YOU'RE ON A TRAIN.

356
00:18:01,625 --> 00:18:03,667
WE'RE GONNA GET YOU OUT OF HERE.

357
00:18:10,083 --> 00:18:12,417
- GAH!
- AH!

358
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:18,125
- EVERYONE OUT.

359
00:18:18,166 --> 00:18:20,458
- I'M NOT GOING UP THERE.

360
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:22,834
AH!
[groans]

361
00:18:29,709 --> 00:18:30,834
AH!

362
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:38,250
- [grunts]

363
00:18:42,875 --> 00:18:44,750
- AH!

364
00:18:55,291 --> 00:18:56,375
- JUMP!

365
00:18:56,417 --> 00:18:59,166
- AH!
- AH!

366
00:18:59,208 --> 00:19:01,875
[groaning]

367
00:19:05,166 --> 00:19:07,542
- [sighs]

368
00:19:07,583 --> 00:19:09,125
- YOU ALL RIGHT?
- YES!

369
00:19:09,166 --> 00:19:11,000
THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU,
THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU,

370
00:19:11,041 --> 00:19:13,625
THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU.
YOU ARE DEFINITELY
GETTING A RAISE, BUDDY.

371
00:19:13,667 --> 00:19:14,834
- YOU SHOULD BE THANKING KORRA.

372
00:19:14,875 --> 00:19:16,709
WE NEVER WOULD HAVE FOUND YOU
WITHOUT HER.

373
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:18,834
- I OWE YOU MY LIFE, AVATAR.

374
00:19:18,875 --> 00:19:21,208
IF ONLY THERE WAS SOME WAY
TO REPAY YOU.

375
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:24,250
OOH, I KNOW.
HOW ABOUT I TAKE YOU OUT
FOR A NIGHT ON THE TOWN?

376
00:19:24,291 --> 00:19:26,792
- REALLY?
YOU'RE ASKING ME OUT RIGHT NOW?

377
00:19:26,834 --> 00:19:29,125
- SO... I'LL PUT YOU DOWN
FOR A "MAYBE"?

378
00:19:29,166 --> 00:19:31,375
- HOW ABOUT A NEVER?

379
00:19:31,417 --> 00:19:34,750
NOT EXACTLY WHAT I IMAGINED
FOR OUR FIRST DAY BACK TOGETHER.

380
00:19:34,792 --> 00:19:37,000
- BUT IT WAS KIND OF LIKE
OLD TIMES.

381
00:19:37,041 --> 00:19:39,917
EXCEPT FOR THE GETTING ON EACH
OTHER'S NERVES PART.

382
00:19:39,959 --> 00:19:43,208
- ACTUALLY, THAT IS LIKE
OLD TIMES FOR ME AND KORRA.

383
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:45,500
- I'M SORRY THINGS GOT SO TENSE
EARLIER.

384
00:19:45,542 --> 00:19:46,875
- IT'S ALL RIGHT.

385
00:19:46,917 --> 00:19:48,959
I GUESS AFTER BEING APART
FOR THREE YEARS,

386
00:19:49,041 --> 00:19:50,792
THERE'S BOUND TO BE A BIT
OF AN ADJUSTMENT PERIOD.

387
00:19:50,834 --> 00:19:53,667
- YEAH, BUT IT'S GREAT
TO HAVE YOU BACK.

388
00:19:53,709 --> 00:19:58,000
- THERE'S NO PLACE ELSE
I'D RATHER BE.

389
00:19:58,041 --> 00:20:00,041
- MM.

390
00:20:00,083 --> 00:20:04,875
YOU GUYS ARE THE GREATEST
FRIENDS A GUY COULD HAVE.

391
00:20:04,917 --> 00:20:07,208
- SO WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO
WITH HIM?

392
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:09,542
IT'S TOO DANGEROUS TO TAKE HIM
BACK TO THE HOTEL.

393
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:10,875
- WHOO.
YOU'RE TELLING ME!

394
00:20:10,917 --> 00:20:12,709
I NEED A CUSHY SAFE HOUSE
SOMEWHERE.

395
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:15,333
- I THINK I KNOW JUST THE PLACE.

396
00:20:17,375 --> 00:20:19,166
- NICE DIGS, MAKO.

397
00:20:19,208 --> 00:20:21,208
YOU DIDN'T TELL ME
YOU CAME FROM MONEY.

398
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:24,041
- I DON'T.
THIS IS ASAMI'S PLACE.

399
00:20:24,083 --> 00:20:25,709
SHE WAS NICE ENOUGH
TO LET MY FAMILY STAY HERE

400
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:28,166
AFTER THEY FLED BA SING SE.

401
00:20:28,208 --> 00:20:29,375
- MAKO!

402
00:20:29,417 --> 00:20:31,166
IT'S SO WONDERFUL TO--

403
00:20:31,208 --> 00:20:32,458
[gasps]

404
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:34,333
ARE YOU...

405
00:20:34,375 --> 00:20:37,166
- GRANDMA,
THIS IS PRINCE WU.

406
00:20:37,208 --> 00:20:39,625
HE NEEDS TO STAY WITH YOU AND
THE FAMILY FOR A LITTLE WHILE.

407
00:20:39,667 --> 00:20:42,375
- IT'S AN HONOR,
GRANDMA MAKO.

408
00:20:42,417 --> 00:20:45,041
- [sighs]

409
00:20:45,083 --> 00:20:46,750
- SHE LOVES ROYALTY.

410
00:20:46,792 --> 00:20:48,792
- I THINK I'LL FIT RIGHT IN
HERE.

411
00:20:48,834 --> 00:20:50,792
THANKS FOR LOOKING OUT FOR ME,
MAKO.

412
00:20:50,834 --> 00:20:52,583
NOW WHERE'S THE NEAREST
BATHROOM?

413
00:20:52,625 --> 00:20:54,917
I HAVE BEEN HOLDING IT ALL DAY!

414
00:20:57,375 --> 00:20:58,750
- I KNOW IT MIGHT NOT MEAN MUCH

415
00:20:58,792 --> 00:21:00,917
COMING FROM A GUY
WEARING THIS UNIFORM,

416
00:21:00,959 --> 00:21:05,417
BUT I'D LIKE TO APOLOGIZE FOR
WHAT KUVIRA'S PUT YOU THROUGH.

417
00:21:05,458 --> 00:21:08,250
- I APPRECIATE THAT.

418
00:21:08,291 --> 00:21:10,375
- GUESS THIS IS WHERE
WE PART WAYS.

419
00:21:10,417 --> 00:21:12,417
- IT'S BEEN A BLAST!

420
00:21:12,458 --> 00:21:13,583
- WE'RE HEADING NORTH TOO.

421
00:21:13,625 --> 00:21:15,250
WHY DON'T YOU COME WITH US?

422
00:21:15,291 --> 00:21:18,166
IT'S THE LEAST WE CAN DO
AFTER YOU SAVED OUR NECKS.

423
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:20,583
- ON THAT HUNK OF JUNK?
NO THANKS.

424
00:21:20,625 --> 00:21:22,041
I'M ALLERGIC TO DROWNING.

425
00:21:22,083 --> 00:21:23,083
OOF!

426
00:21:23,125 --> 00:21:25,750
I MEAN, UH,
WE'D LOVE A LIFT!

427
00:21:29,291 --> 00:21:31,875
EW.
UH.

428
00:21:31,917 --> 00:21:34,834
[groaning]

429
00:21:41,458 --> 00:21:43,917
[monitor whirring]

430
00:21:43,959 --> 00:21:46,417
- THIS AREA IS OVERRUN
WITH SPIRIT VINES

431
00:21:46,458 --> 00:21:48,417
AND THEY APPEAR TO BE
EVEN MORE POWERFUL

432
00:21:48,458 --> 00:21:50,917
THAN THE SAMPLES WE TOOK
FROM REPUBLIC CITY.

433
00:21:50,959 --> 00:21:52,250
- PERFECT.

434
00:21:52,291 --> 00:21:55,917
HARVEST THESE VINES
UNTIL THERE'S NOTHING LEFT.

435
00:21:58,458 --> 00:22:01,625
[saws buzzing]
