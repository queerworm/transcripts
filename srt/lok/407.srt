1
00:00:06,939 --> 00:00:08,473
Earth.

2
00:00:08,475 --> 00:00:10,375
Fire.

3
00:00:10,377 --> 00:00:12,143
Air.

4
00:00:12,145 --> 00:00:13,445
Water.

5
00:00:13,447 --> 00:00:17,682
Only the Avatar can
master all four elements

6
00:00:17,684 --> 00:00:20,292
and bring balance to the world.

7
00:00:26,222 --> 00:00:27,889
Kuvira has defeated the Avatar

8
00:00:27,891 --> 00:00:30,058
and now controls the entire earth empire.

9
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:33,228
Luckily, the airbender
kids and Opal rescued Korra

10
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:34,162
and escaped Zaofu.

11
00:00:34,164 --> 00:00:35,797
For the first time in three years,

12
00:00:35,799 --> 00:00:37,265
Korra will finally be
back in Republic City.

13
00:00:37,267 --> 00:00:40,502
Meanwhile, Varrick and
Bolin escaped from Baatar Jr.

14
00:00:40,504 --> 00:00:41,203
And are on the run.

15
00:00:41,205 --> 00:00:42,737
But will they make it
back to the city in time

16
00:00:42,739 --> 00:00:47,442
to warn everyone about Kuvira's
new spirit energy super weapon?

17
00:01:05,861 --> 00:01:08,630
Naga!

18
00:01:25,314 --> 00:01:27,415
I missed you so much, girl.

19
00:01:27,417 --> 00:01:30,252
Mom! Dad! We're back!

20
00:01:30,254 --> 00:01:31,254
And we got Korra!

21
00:01:31,255 --> 00:01:34,689
Well, aren't you a sight for sore eyes.

22
00:01:34,691 --> 00:01:36,958
Bum-Ju and I sure missed you.

23
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:39,561
It's so great to see you again, Bumi.

24
00:01:39,563 --> 00:01:40,929
And you too, Bum-Ju.

25
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,165
Well done, kids.

26
00:01:44,167 --> 00:01:46,668
I'm proud of you all for finding Korra.

27
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:50,338
Proud enough to get me my tats?

28
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:52,841
No.

29
00:01:52,843 --> 00:01:53,742
Welcome home.

30
00:01:53,744 --> 00:01:55,143
I missed you, Tenzin.

31
00:01:55,145 --> 00:01:57,245
Now, I hate to get right down to business,

32
00:01:57,247 --> 00:02:00,649
but I want to hear what happened in Zaofu.

33
00:02:01,385 --> 00:02:03,051
Way to ruin the moment.

34
00:02:03,053 --> 00:02:04,719
Kuvira's whole army was there.

35
00:02:04,721 --> 00:02:07,022
She captured mom, dad, and my brothers.

36
00:02:07,024 --> 00:02:10,091
I thought I was strong enough to stop her.

37
00:02:10,093 --> 00:02:11,426
I feel like such a failure.

38
00:02:11,428 --> 00:02:14,396
No one expected you to
handle Kuvira on your own.

39
00:02:14,398 --> 00:02:19,067
It's up to all of us to
find a way to deal with her.

40
00:02:19,069 --> 00:02:21,803
We're just glad to have you back.

41
00:02:21,805 --> 00:02:23,004
Where's Bolin?

42
00:02:23,006 --> 00:02:25,440
He's not still on Kuvira's side, is he?

43
00:02:25,442 --> 00:02:27,275
I can't believe he would stay with her

44
00:02:27,277 --> 00:02:29,210
after what she did to my family.

45
00:02:29,212 --> 00:02:32,747
But we don't know where he is.

46
00:02:34,318 --> 00:02:36,651
How about you use your
own legs for a while?

47
00:02:36,653 --> 00:02:39,321
You know, when I fled
Republic City with Zhu Li,

48
00:02:39,323 --> 00:02:42,057
she carried me twenty Miles in one day.

49
00:02:42,059 --> 00:02:44,125
And that was after she sprained her ankle.

50
00:02:44,127 --> 00:02:47,128
Well, Zhu Li's not here, okay?

51
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:47,962
That's fine.

52
00:02:47,964 --> 00:02:50,999
Leave me here. Let the worms gobble me up.

53
00:02:51,001 --> 00:02:53,101
I deserve it. No way, mister.

54
00:02:53,103 --> 00:02:54,402
You're not getting off that easily.

55
00:02:54,404 --> 00:02:57,138
You're responsible for that
weapon Kuvira's trying to make.

56
00:02:57,140 --> 00:03:00,875
Which, may I remind you,
could hurt a lot of people.

57
00:03:00,877 --> 00:03:01,877
No, don't remind me!

58
00:03:01,878 --> 00:03:04,979
I know, I'm a horrible, horrible person.

59
00:03:04,981 --> 00:03:05,847
Okay, look,

60
00:03:05,849 --> 00:03:08,083
Kuvira fooled us both
into doing her dirty work

61
00:03:08,085 --> 00:03:09,517
and I'm not happy about it either.

62
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:12,654
But you know how we're gonna
make it up to the world?

63
00:03:12,656 --> 00:03:14,055
By getting back to Republic City

64
00:03:14,057 --> 00:03:16,358
and warning everyone what she's up to.

65
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:19,160
So I want you to take my hand,

66
00:03:19,162 --> 00:03:24,032
and march with me out of this forest!

67
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:26,334
You really have a way with words, kid.

68
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:28,336
No wonder I made you a mover star.

69
00:03:28,338 --> 00:03:31,139
All right, I'll take the
driver's seat for a while.

70
00:03:31,141 --> 00:03:31,973
Hop on.

71
00:03:31,975 --> 00:03:32,874
Great.

72
00:03:32,876 --> 00:03:34,476
My feet could use a break.

73
00:03:34,478 --> 00:03:38,179
Okay. Oh, boy.

74
00:03:38,181 --> 00:03:40,048
Here we go.

75
00:03:42,886 --> 00:03:45,253
- Ah!
- Oh!

76
00:03:45,255 --> 00:03:48,056
Are you kidding me?

77
00:03:50,593 --> 00:03:53,395
I hope you haven't been waiting long.

78
00:03:53,397 --> 00:03:56,998
Only three years.

79
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,434
It's so good to see you again.

80
00:03:59,436 --> 00:04:00,502
You too.

81
00:04:00,504 --> 00:04:02,270
And I'm loving the hair.

82
00:04:02,272 --> 00:04:05,039
Thanks. You're looking snazzy as always.

83
00:04:05,041 --> 00:04:09,944
Come on, Mako got us a
table at the restaurant.

84
00:04:09,946 --> 00:04:10,912
Korra!

85
00:04:10,914 --> 00:04:13,148
Hi, Mako.

86
00:04:14,483 --> 00:04:16,217
Hello there, Prince Wu,

87
00:04:16,219 --> 00:04:18,887
rightful heir to the
throne, and this guy's boss.

88
00:04:18,889 --> 00:04:22,123
I bet he's
told you a lot about me.

89
00:04:22,125 --> 00:04:23,158
Nope. Not a thing.

90
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:25,927
Then we have so much to talk about.

91
00:04:25,929 --> 00:04:27,862
You are going to love the food here.

92
00:04:27,864 --> 00:04:28,897
I know the chef personally.

93
00:04:28,899 --> 00:04:32,167
Let's start with a round of
your spicy octopus fritters.

94
00:04:32,169 --> 00:04:34,569
And keep the cucumber-aloe water flowing.

95
00:04:34,571 --> 00:04:38,773
Got to keep this princely skin hydrated.

96
00:04:38,775 --> 00:04:41,576
I thought it was just
going to be the three of us.

97
00:04:41,578 --> 00:04:43,978
Sorry, I couldn't ditch him.

98
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:46,080
But he promised to be on his best behavior.

99
00:04:46,082 --> 00:04:48,383
Hey, pop into the Avatar state for me.

100
00:04:48,385 --> 00:04:50,485
I want to see your eyes glow.

101
00:04:50,487 --> 00:04:52,053
What? No.

102
00:04:52,522 --> 00:04:55,423
So can you go into the Avatar state again?

103
00:04:55,425 --> 00:04:58,326
I was worried when you
told me you couldn't.

104
00:04:58,328 --> 00:04:59,494
Wait.

105
00:04:59,496 --> 00:05:01,796
When did she tell you she couldn't?

106
00:05:03,366 --> 00:05:05,500
What's going on with you two?

107
00:05:05,502 --> 00:05:07,502
I wrote to Asami while I was away.

108
00:05:07,504 --> 00:05:10,338
I asked her not to tell you. I'm sorry.

109
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:12,440
Well, why didn't you ever write to me?

110
00:05:12,442 --> 00:05:13,775
Or Bolin?

111
00:05:13,777 --> 00:05:14,509
I don't know.

112
00:05:14,511 --> 00:05:17,145
I guess I didn't know what to say.

113
00:05:17,147 --> 00:05:18,413
A "hello" would have been nice.

114
00:05:18,415 --> 00:05:20,548
Mako, if it makes you feel any better,

115
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:22,283
she didn't write me either.

116
00:05:22,285 --> 00:05:23,285
Why would she...

117
00:05:23,286 --> 00:05:24,519
Never mind.

118
00:05:24,521 --> 00:05:27,956
I'm sorry I didn't stay
in touch, but I'm back now.

119
00:05:27,958 --> 00:05:29,157
And I want to know everything

120
00:05:29,159 --> 00:05:30,925
about what's been going on with you two.

121
00:05:30,927 --> 00:05:33,127
Well, I kind of have some big news.

122
00:05:33,129 --> 00:05:36,464
I went to visit my
father for the first time.

123
00:05:36,466 --> 00:05:37,465
He'd been writing me letters

124
00:05:37,467 --> 00:05:41,903
and I guess I finally felt
ready to try and forgive him.

125
00:05:41,905 --> 00:05:43,404
You sure you can trust him?

126
00:05:43,406 --> 00:05:45,306
He might just be manipulating you again.

127
00:05:45,308 --> 00:05:48,710
You think I don't know what
my own father is capable of?

128
00:05:48,712 --> 00:05:50,011
No. No, I didn't mean...

129
00:05:50,013 --> 00:05:52,013
you don't get to disappear for three years

130
00:05:52,015 --> 00:05:54,249
and then act like you
know what's best for me.

131
00:05:54,251 --> 00:05:56,084
It's not like I planned
to be gone that long.

132
00:05:56,086 --> 00:06:00,121
I wanted to come back, but
I never felt ready until now.

133
00:06:00,123 --> 00:06:02,490
As much as I'm enjoying
this little catch-up,

134
00:06:02,492 --> 00:06:05,927
my royal bladder is about to explode.

135
00:06:05,929 --> 00:06:06,394
Mako?

136
00:06:06,396 --> 00:06:08,229
Come on, I need you to stand guard.

137
00:06:08,231 --> 00:06:09,330
I'm not gonna hold your hand

138
00:06:09,332 --> 00:06:11,432
every time you have to
empty your royal bladder.

139
00:06:11,434 --> 00:06:14,068
Go to the bathroom on your own for once.

140
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:17,171
Fine.

141
00:06:17,173 --> 00:06:19,541
Do you always go to the bathroom with him?

142
00:06:19,543 --> 00:06:21,009
I don't go "with him" with him.

143
00:06:21,011 --> 00:06:24,345
I just stand there in the
general vicinity while he...

144
00:06:24,347 --> 00:06:27,815
I don't want to talk about it.

145
00:06:30,386 --> 00:06:31,352
Good afternoon, sir.

146
00:06:31,354 --> 00:06:34,222
Perhaps a spritz of cologne to freshen up?

147
00:06:34,224 --> 00:06:36,424
Make it a double, buddy.

148
00:06:41,093 --> 00:06:42,860
Mako, help!

149
00:06:42,862 --> 00:06:44,795
Wu down.

150
00:06:44,797 --> 00:06:47,097
Wu... Down.

151
00:06:51,737 --> 00:06:53,304
I wish Pabu were here.

152
00:06:53,306 --> 00:06:54,872
He could just chew us out of this.

153
00:06:54,874 --> 00:06:58,709
You know who else has
incisors sharp as a knife?

154
00:06:58,711 --> 00:07:01,078
Zhu Li.

155
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:02,179
Well, look what we caught.

156
00:07:02,181 --> 00:07:06,617
Wonder if they were
tracking us after we escaped.

157
00:07:06,619 --> 00:07:07,985
Hello, fellow travelers!

158
00:07:07,987 --> 00:07:10,621
I don't suppose you could
help us out of this net?

159
00:07:10,623 --> 00:07:15,859
Why would we free a couple of
lowly earth empire soldiers?

160
00:07:15,861 --> 00:07:16,427
Lowly?

161
00:07:16,429 --> 00:07:19,263
We were part of Kuvira's inner circle!

162
00:07:19,265 --> 00:07:20,130
Were! Not anymore.

163
00:07:20,132 --> 00:07:22,933
We jumped ship. Please just let us out.

164
00:07:22,935 --> 00:07:24,702
I think I know just what to do

165
00:07:24,704 --> 00:07:28,672
with a couple of Kuvira's top men.

166
00:07:30,075 --> 00:07:31,075
Snap!

167
00:07:31,077 --> 00:07:32,676
Ahh!

168
00:07:35,013 --> 00:07:37,348
I wonder what's taking Wu so long.

169
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:39,950
He's not one to miss out on lunch.

170
00:07:39,952 --> 00:07:42,620
I'll go check on him.

171
00:07:49,728 --> 00:07:50,928
Wu, you in here?

172
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:53,831
Come on, your octopus
fritters are getting cold.

173
00:07:57,802 --> 00:08:00,904
I'll be right back.

174
00:08:02,807 --> 00:08:06,977
Excuse me, did you happen to see
if Prince Wu came out this way?

175
00:08:06,979 --> 00:08:09,046
Sorry, miss. Haven't seen him.

176
00:08:09,048 --> 00:08:13,050
Hmm. I'm in laundry.

177
00:08:13,052 --> 00:08:14,052
Ah!

178
00:08:18,024 --> 00:08:18,956
They've got Wu!

179
00:08:18,958 --> 00:08:21,959
Get the car, I'm going after them.

180
00:08:32,962 --> 00:08:35,330
Get in.

181
00:08:43,673 --> 00:08:46,641
- Ah!
- Ah!

182
00:08:46,643 --> 00:08:47,542
We're losing them.

183
00:08:47,544 --> 00:08:48,977
Hang a right at the next block.

184
00:08:48,979 --> 00:08:52,314
We can cut them off on seventh.

185
00:08:52,316 --> 00:08:54,349
You missed the turn! Where are you going?

186
00:08:54,351 --> 00:08:56,384
I know these streets better than you.

187
00:08:56,386 --> 00:08:58,587
I built some of them.

188
00:09:04,727 --> 00:09:08,430
What are you doing? Sit down.

189
00:09:13,936 --> 00:09:17,539
Where is he?

190
00:09:17,541 --> 00:09:19,307
Whoa!

191
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:25,146
Wu's not here.

192
00:09:25,148 --> 00:09:28,149
This guy was the only one in the truck.

193
00:09:28,752 --> 00:09:30,452
Where's the prince?

194
00:09:30,454 --> 00:09:33,088
Halfway to Kuvira by now.

195
00:09:34,191 --> 00:09:36,157
All hail the Great Uniter.

196
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:38,693
They must have moved Wu
to a different vehicle

197
00:09:38,695 --> 00:09:40,295
when we lost sight of them.

198
00:09:44,668 --> 00:09:46,301
Take this guy in for booking.

199
00:09:46,303 --> 00:09:47,369
Charge him with kidnapping.

200
00:09:47,371 --> 00:09:50,038
And tell Chief Beifong
that Prince Wu is missing.

201
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,806
Put out an all points bulletin.

202
00:09:51,808 --> 00:09:53,475
We'll keep looking.

203
00:09:53,477 --> 00:09:54,409
Where do we start?

204
00:09:54,411 --> 00:09:56,711
There are thousands of cars in the city

205
00:09:56,713 --> 00:09:58,213
and he could be in any one of them.

206
00:09:58,215 --> 00:10:01,149
Or they might try smuggling
him out on an airship.

207
00:10:01,151 --> 00:10:02,350
Or maybe a boat.

208
00:10:02,352 --> 00:10:04,152
He could be anywhere!

209
00:10:04,154 --> 00:10:09,124
The one time I don't watch him
pee and this is what happens.

210
00:10:25,741 --> 00:10:28,243
They're taking Wu to the train station!

211
00:10:28,245 --> 00:10:29,844
Are you sure? How do you know?

212
00:10:29,846 --> 00:10:32,414
I'll explain on the way, just drive!

213
00:10:32,416 --> 00:10:35,517
We're running out of time!

214
00:10:38,688 --> 00:10:42,357
So how did a bunch of
water and fire benders

215
00:10:42,359 --> 00:10:45,427
end up in one of Kuvira's
reeducation camps?

216
00:10:45,429 --> 00:10:47,696
Call it what it is... a prison.

217
00:10:47,698 --> 00:10:49,431
Kuvira's been purging states of anyone

218
00:10:49,433 --> 00:10:53,068
who's not of earth kingdom
origin and locking them up.

219
00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:53,668
Purging?

220
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:55,370
What are you acting so surprised for?

221
00:10:55,372 --> 00:10:57,272
You must have known what she was up to,

222
00:10:57,274 --> 00:11:00,141
being part of her "inner circle" and all.

223
00:11:00,143 --> 00:11:00,775
No, I swear.

224
00:11:00,777 --> 00:11:03,745
And the inner circle thing
lasted, like, less than a day.

225
00:11:03,747 --> 00:11:07,415
Will you at least tell
us where you're taking us?

226
00:11:07,417 --> 00:11:08,483
The border checkpoint.

227
00:11:08,485 --> 00:11:10,318
You're gonna help us talk our way past

228
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,187
some earth empire soldiers.

229
00:11:12,189 --> 00:11:13,221
And once we're through,

230
00:11:13,223 --> 00:11:16,291
we'll see about letting you go.

231
00:11:24,033 --> 00:11:24,599
Ha ha!

232
00:11:24,601 --> 00:11:27,402
Lava time! Bet you didn't expect that!

233
00:11:27,404 --> 00:11:30,205
Look, I'm sorry for what
happened to all of you,

234
00:11:30,207 --> 00:11:32,240
but as I've been trying to explain,

235
00:11:32,242 --> 00:11:34,476
we don't work for Kuvira anymore.

236
00:11:34,478 --> 00:11:37,545
Yeah, if our handsome mugs get recognized

237
00:11:37,547 --> 00:11:39,581
trying to go through that checkpoint,

238
00:11:39,583 --> 00:11:40,415
we're goners!

239
00:11:40,417 --> 00:11:43,184
If you really are fugitives,
you better listen up.

240
00:11:43,186 --> 00:11:45,186
We've been scouting this region for days.

241
00:11:45,188 --> 00:11:47,722
There's a wall stretching
along the entire border

242
00:11:47,724 --> 00:11:49,624
and patrols guarding every part of it.

243
00:11:49,626 --> 00:11:51,960
That checkpoint is our only way out.

244
00:11:51,962 --> 00:11:54,395
It's not worth the risk, baraz.

245
00:11:54,397 --> 00:11:56,464
How do we know they won't turn us in?

246
00:11:56,466 --> 00:11:57,466
If he wanted us gone,

247
00:11:57,467 --> 00:11:59,601
we'd be at the bottom of
a pool of lava right now.

248
00:11:59,603 --> 00:12:02,804
If any of us want to get out
of the earth empire alive,

249
00:12:02,806 --> 00:12:06,341
we'll have to trust each other.

250
00:12:08,511 --> 00:12:12,113
All right, where's this checkpoint?

251
00:12:13,617 --> 00:12:15,216
So how do you know where Wu is

252
00:12:15,218 --> 00:12:16,484
just by touching some spirit vines?

253
00:12:16,486 --> 00:12:19,721
I learned how to connect to
people's energy through them.

254
00:12:19,723 --> 00:12:21,189
Who taught you that?

255
00:12:21,191 --> 00:12:22,423
Lin's mom.

256
00:12:22,425 --> 00:12:23,425
I found her in the swamp.

257
00:12:23,426 --> 00:12:26,361
That place is like one giant spirit wild.

258
00:12:26,363 --> 00:12:27,729
You met Toph?

259
00:12:27,731 --> 00:12:28,530
What was she like?

260
00:12:28,532 --> 00:12:31,399
A cranky, more miserable version of Lin.

261
00:12:31,401 --> 00:12:33,268
Is that even possible?

262
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:35,570
You'd be surprised.

263
00:12:45,247 --> 00:12:46,781
Which train is Wu on?

264
00:12:46,783 --> 00:12:47,682
I don't know!

265
00:12:47,684 --> 00:12:50,718
Split up and start looking.

266
00:12:59,328 --> 00:13:01,796
Follow my lead.

267
00:13:01,798 --> 00:13:04,666
Good afternoon, sir. Can we help you?

268
00:13:04,668 --> 00:13:05,567
You sure can.

269
00:13:05,569 --> 00:13:06,801
We captured these escaped prisoners.

270
00:13:06,803 --> 00:13:08,603
We need to get them to a secure facility.

271
00:13:08,605 --> 00:13:11,406
- Where'd they escape from?
- Camp 14.

272
00:13:11,408 --> 00:13:13,675
Then why are you bringing
them through here?

273
00:13:13,677 --> 00:13:15,009
Camp 14's back the other way.

274
00:13:15,011 --> 00:13:18,546
You think we don't know where camp 14 is?

275
00:13:18,548 --> 00:13:20,315
Kuvira wants them transferred.

276
00:13:20,317 --> 00:13:23,618
Then I'll need to see the transfer order.

277
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:26,254
Listen, pal, I had to
fight off 2 badger-moles,

278
00:13:26,256 --> 00:13:28,957
6 wolf-bats, and 18
hog-monkeys to get these guys.

279
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:30,658
So sorry if I don't have the paperwork.

280
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:33,494
I was too busy cramming
it in a hog-monkey's mouth

281
00:13:33,496 --> 00:13:34,796
while it was trying to eat me.

282
00:13:34,798 --> 00:13:35,830
I am in sore need of a shower

283
00:13:35,832 --> 00:13:38,600
and I have blisters that
are the size of cantaloupes

284
00:13:38,602 --> 00:13:39,767
and twice as juicy!

285
00:13:39,769 --> 00:13:40,768
So you can let us through,

286
00:13:40,770 --> 00:13:42,303
or you can give me your name and rank

287
00:13:42,305 --> 00:13:43,438
and I'll pass it on to Kuvira.

288
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,706
You know what happens to soldiers

289
00:13:44,708 --> 00:13:46,841
who question her orders, don't you?

290
00:13:46,843 --> 00:13:49,911
Bad stuff!

291
00:13:49,913 --> 00:13:51,746
Let them through!

292
00:14:07,529 --> 00:14:08,630
Wait! Stop them!

293
00:14:08,632 --> 00:14:11,532
They're traitors to the empire!

294
00:14:22,111 --> 00:14:26,814
There's no way I'm going back to prison!

295
00:14:38,594 --> 00:14:40,762
Ah. Ah! Ah!

296
00:15:14,697 --> 00:15:17,298
Ah!

297
00:15:19,568 --> 00:15:21,436
Ah!

298
00:16:10,085 --> 00:16:12,920
Boy, I sure hope this works.

299
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:26,834
I still got that Varrick touch.

300
00:16:29,605 --> 00:16:33,007
We're clear. Come on!

301
00:16:34,643 --> 00:16:37,678
Ah!

302
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:41,482
Varrick, wait! We can't leave them.

303
00:16:44,586 --> 00:16:46,954
Ah!

304
00:16:49,758 --> 00:16:51,492
Retreat!

305
00:16:57,066 --> 00:17:00,068
Thanks. You didn't have to come back.

306
00:17:00,070 --> 00:17:02,804
Yeah, I kind of did.

307
00:17:02,806 --> 00:17:04,806
Let's go.

308
00:17:04,808 --> 00:17:07,308
The 4:15 bound for Omashu

309
00:17:07,310 --> 00:17:10,011
is now leaving on track number six.

310
00:17:10,013 --> 00:17:12,947
All aboard!

311
00:17:13,248 --> 00:17:18,519
If we don't find Wu soon,
we might never find him.

312
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:27,562
He's on that train!

313
00:17:30,399 --> 00:17:32,233
How do you know for sure he's here?

314
00:17:32,235 --> 00:17:34,635
I don't. But I had a feeling, okay?

315
00:17:34,637 --> 00:17:37,105
And I'm just supposed to
trust "Avatar feelings"?

316
00:17:37,107 --> 00:17:39,807
You wouldn't have to if
you had guarded the prince

317
00:17:39,809 --> 00:17:42,276
like you were supposed to.

318
00:17:42,278 --> 00:17:45,012
Oh, so it's my fault Wu disappeared.

319
00:17:45,014 --> 00:17:46,814
It's certainly not mine!

320
00:17:46,816 --> 00:17:47,816
Guys, shh.

321
00:17:47,817 --> 00:17:52,186
Listen.

322
00:17:53,756 --> 00:17:55,590
Wu! Wu, it's me.

323
00:17:55,592 --> 00:17:57,391
Mako? Where am I?

324
00:17:57,393 --> 00:18:00,895
Am I dead? No, you're on a train.

325
00:18:00,897 --> 00:18:03,831
We're gonna get you out of here.

326
00:18:09,705 --> 00:18:12,640
- Gah!
- Ah!

327
00:18:16,044 --> 00:18:17,645
Everyone out.

328
00:18:17,647 --> 00:18:20,281
I'm not going up there.

329
00:18:20,283 --> 00:18:22,984
Ah!

330
00:18:29,625 --> 00:18:31,192
Ah!

331
00:18:42,738 --> 00:18:44,939
Ah!

332
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:56,017
Jump!

333
00:18:56,019 --> 00:18:58,886
- Ah!
- Ah!

334
00:19:06,963 --> 00:19:07,895
- You all right?
- Yes!

335
00:19:07,897 --> 00:19:10,131
Thank you, thank you, thank you,
thank you, thank you, thank you,

336
00:19:10,133 --> 00:19:11,165
thank you, thank you, thank you.

337
00:19:11,167 --> 00:19:12,900
You are definitely getting a raise, buddy.

338
00:19:12,902 --> 00:19:14,035
You should be thanking Korra.

339
00:19:14,037 --> 00:19:16,237
We never would have found you without her.

340
00:19:16,239 --> 00:19:18,072
I owe you my life, Avatar.

341
00:19:18,074 --> 00:19:20,908
If only there was some way to repay you.

342
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:21,642
Ooh, I know.

343
00:19:21,644 --> 00:19:23,377
How about I take you out
for a night on the town?

344
00:19:23,379 --> 00:19:25,880
Really? You're asking me out right now?

345
00:19:25,882 --> 00:19:28,716
So... I'll put you down for a "maybe"?

346
00:19:28,718 --> 00:19:30,218
How about a never?

347
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:33,921
Not exactly what I imagined
for our first day back together.

348
00:19:33,923 --> 00:19:35,856
But it was kind of like old times.

349
00:19:35,858 --> 00:19:38,793
Except for the getting on
each other's nerves part.

350
00:19:38,795 --> 00:19:42,430
Actually, that is like
old times for me and Korra.

351
00:19:42,432 --> 00:19:45,299
I'm sorry things got so tense earlier.

352
00:19:45,301 --> 00:19:46,167
It's all right.

353
00:19:46,169 --> 00:19:47,902
I guess after being apart for three years,

354
00:19:47,904 --> 00:19:50,104
there's bound to be a bit
of an adjustment period.

355
00:19:50,106 --> 00:19:52,807
Yeah, but it's great to have you back.

356
00:19:52,809 --> 00:19:58,079
There's no place else I'd rather be.

357
00:19:58,081 --> 00:19:59,146
Mm.

358
00:19:59,148 --> 00:20:04,285
You guys are the greatest
friends a guy could have.

359
00:20:04,287 --> 00:20:06,287
So what are we gonna do with him?

360
00:20:06,289 --> 00:20:08,923
It's too dangerous to
take him back to the hotel.

361
00:20:08,925 --> 00:20:10,258
Whoo. You're telling me!

362
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:12,260
I need a cushy safe house somewhere.

363
00:20:12,262 --> 00:20:15,630
I think I know just the place.

364
00:20:16,965 --> 00:20:18,432
Nice digs, Mako.

365
00:20:18,434 --> 00:20:20,568
You didn't tell me you came from money.

366
00:20:20,570 --> 00:20:23,004
I don't. This is Asami's place.

367
00:20:23,006 --> 00:20:25,306
She was nice enough to
let my family stay here

368
00:20:25,308 --> 00:20:28,009
after they fled Ba Sing Se.

369
00:20:28,011 --> 00:20:28,943
Mako!

370
00:20:28,945 --> 00:20:31,012
It's so wonderful to...

371
00:20:32,415 --> 00:20:33,748
Are you...

372
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:35,883
Grandma, this is Prince Wu.

373
00:20:35,885 --> 00:20:38,986
He needs to stay with you and
the family for a little while.

374
00:20:38,988 --> 00:20:42,390
It's an honor, grandma Mako.

375
00:20:44,727 --> 00:20:45,993
She loves royalty.

376
00:20:45,995 --> 00:20:48,195
I think I'll fit right in here.

377
00:20:48,197 --> 00:20:50,264
Thanks for looking out for me, Mako.

378
00:20:50,266 --> 00:20:51,966
Now where's the nearest bathroom?

379
00:20:51,968 --> 00:20:55,336
I have been holding it all day!

380
00:20:56,772 --> 00:20:57,938
I know it might not mean much

381
00:20:57,940 --> 00:20:59,640
coming from a guy wearing this uniform,

382
00:20:59,642 --> 00:21:04,979
but I'd like to apologize for
what Kuvira's put you through.

383
00:21:04,981 --> 00:21:07,515
I appreciate that.

384
00:21:07,517 --> 00:21:09,950
Guess this is where we part ways.

385
00:21:09,952 --> 00:21:11,886
It's been a blast!

386
00:21:11,888 --> 00:21:13,187
We're heading north too.

387
00:21:13,189 --> 00:21:14,322
Why don't you come with us?

388
00:21:14,324 --> 00:21:17,491
It's the least we can do
after you saved our necks.

389
00:21:17,493 --> 00:21:20,261
On that hunk of junk? No thanks.

390
00:21:20,263 --> 00:21:21,962
I'm allergic to drowning.

391
00:21:21,964 --> 00:21:22,530
Oof!

392
00:21:22,532 --> 00:21:26,167
I mean, uh, we'd love a lift!

393
00:21:29,204 --> 00:21:31,739
Ew. Uh.

394
00:21:43,052 --> 00:21:45,486
This area is overrun with spirit vines

395
00:21:45,488 --> 00:21:47,455
and they appear to be even more powerful

396
00:21:47,457 --> 00:21:50,358
than the samples we
took from Republic City.

397
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:51,192
Perfect.

398
00:21:51,194 --> 00:21:56,197
Harvest these vines until
there's nothing left.
