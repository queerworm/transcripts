1
00:00:01,377 --> 00:00:02,752
Earth.

2
00:00:03,296 --> 00:00:04,629
Fire.

3
00:00:04,964 --> 00:00:06,339
Air.

4
00:00:06,841 --> 00:00:08,049
Water.

5
00:00:08,843 --> 00:00:12,888
Only the Avatar can master
all four elements

6
00:00:12,972 --> 00:00:15,182
and bring balance to the world.

7
00:00:20,855 --> 00:00:24,065
Republic City welcomes
a new citizen into her arms.

8
00:00:24,192 --> 00:00:25,901
Avatar Korra!

9
00:00:25,985 --> 00:00:29,613
After years of seclusion in the South,
this master of water, earth and fire

10
00:00:29,697 --> 00:00:32,407
seeks to add airbending
to her list of skills.

11
00:00:32,491 --> 00:00:35,994
And under the tutelage of Tenzin,
Avatar Aang's son, she should go far.

12
00:00:36,495 --> 00:00:38,997
But will this cool, calm,
collected master of air

13
00:00:38,998 --> 00:00:40,916
be able to tame this hot-headed teen?

14
00:00:50,384 --> 00:00:52,010
"And in the final round,"

15
00:00:52,011 --> 00:00:53,220
"the Buzzard Wasps won,"

16
00:00:53,304 --> 00:00:55,472
"with a decisive knockout."

17
00:00:55,556 --> 00:00:56,973
What do you say
we go to the arena tonight?

18
00:00:57,058 --> 00:00:59,100
Catch a few Pro-bending matches?

19
00:00:59,393 --> 00:01:02,938
That "sport" is a mockery of
the noble tradition of bending.

20
00:01:03,022 --> 00:01:04,606
Come on, Tenzin.

21
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:07,025
I've dreamed about seeing
a Pro-bending match since I was a kid,

22
00:01:07,026 --> 00:01:09,236
and now I'm just a ferry ride away
from the arena.

23
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:11,613
Korra, you're not here
to watch that drivel.

24
00:01:11,697 --> 00:01:13,865
You're here to finish your Avatar training.

25
00:01:14,033 --> 00:01:16,910
So, for the time being,
I want you to remain on the island.

26
00:01:16,994 --> 00:01:19,037
Is that why you're keeping
the White Lotus sentries around,

27
00:01:19,038 --> 00:01:21,122
- to watch my every move?
- Yes.

28
00:01:21,207 --> 00:01:25,752
In order to learn airbending, I believe
you require a calm, quiet environment,

29
00:01:25,836 --> 00:01:27,504
free from any distractions.

30
00:01:27,588 --> 00:01:29,923
All right, you're the master.

31
00:01:38,182 --> 00:01:42,352
So my mother informed me that you've
never been able to airbend before.

32
00:01:44,063 --> 00:01:45,605
Yeah, but I don't know why.

33
00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:47,649
The other elements came
so easily to me.

34
00:01:47,733 --> 00:01:50,986
But every single time
I've tried airbending...

35
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:52,191
Nothing.

36
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:54,864
That's perfectly all right,
we just need to be patient.

37
00:01:55,074 --> 00:01:58,076
Often, the element that's the most
difficult for the Avatar to master

38
00:01:58,077 --> 00:02:01,037
is the one most opposite
to the Avatar's personality.

39
00:02:01,122 --> 00:02:02,998
For Aang, it was earthbending.

40
00:02:03,082 --> 00:02:06,293
Yeah, well, I'm about as opposite
an Airbender as you can get.

41
00:02:06,544 --> 00:02:08,837
Let's begin your first lesson.

42
00:02:11,299 --> 00:02:14,092
Korra's going to airbend!
Korra's going to airbend!

43
00:02:14,093 --> 00:02:15,844
What is that contraption?

44
00:02:15,928 --> 00:02:20,682
A time honored tool that teaches the
most fundamental aspect of airbending.

45
00:02:20,766 --> 00:02:23,101
Jinora, would you like to
explain this exercise?

46
00:02:23,185 --> 00:02:25,228
The goal is to weave your way
through the gates

47
00:02:25,313 --> 00:02:28,106
and make it to the other side
without touching them.

48
00:02:28,357 --> 00:02:29,649
Seems easy enough.

49
00:02:29,734 --> 00:02:32,814
Jinora forgot to say you have to make it
through while the gates are spinning.

50
00:02:42,121 --> 00:02:44,956
The key is to be like the leaf.

51
00:02:47,001 --> 00:02:50,128
Flow with the movement of the gates.

52
00:02:51,714 --> 00:02:53,214
Jinora will demonstrate.

53
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:58,428
Airbending is all about
spiral movements.

54
00:02:58,512 --> 00:03:00,055
When you meet resistance,

55
00:03:00,139 --> 00:03:03,433
you must be able to switch direction
at a moment's notice.

56
00:03:10,316 --> 00:03:11,941
Let's do this.

57
00:03:28,167 --> 00:03:29,876
Don't force your way through.

58
00:03:31,003 --> 00:03:32,629
Dance! Dance like the wind!

59
00:03:33,589 --> 00:03:35,131
Be the leaf!

60
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,978
Airbend!

61
00:03:51,649 --> 00:03:53,566
What is wrong with me?

62
00:03:53,859 --> 00:03:54,859
Airbend!

63
00:04:01,617 --> 00:04:04,202
Maybe I'm just not cut out
to be an Airbender, huh, Naga?

64
00:04:04,328 --> 00:04:05,662
Ladies and gentlemen,

65
00:04:05,788 --> 00:04:08,706
I'm coming to you live
from Republic City's Pro-bending Arena,

66
00:04:08,874 --> 00:04:11,543
where tonight, the best in the world
continue their quest

67
00:04:11,627 --> 00:04:14,879
for a spot in the upcoming
Championship Tournament.

68
00:04:14,964 --> 00:04:16,798
Grab your snacks and grab your kids,

69
00:04:16,882 --> 00:04:20,218
because this next match
is going to be a doozy.

70
00:04:20,594 --> 00:04:22,220
This Mako's got moxie!

71
00:04:22,221 --> 00:04:24,264
He advances, fires two quick shots.

72
00:04:24,348 --> 00:04:26,182
Yomo is hammered back to Zone 3.

73
00:04:26,267 --> 00:04:28,601
The clock is winding down,
can Yomo hold on?

74
00:04:28,686 --> 00:04:30,395
He's teetering on the edge
of the ring now.

75
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:32,397
The Fire Ferrets line up to strike...

76
00:04:35,776 --> 00:04:37,235
Korra, come down here, please.

77
00:04:40,072 --> 00:04:41,698
You shut it off at the best part!

78
00:04:41,782 --> 00:04:43,616
I thought I made myself clear.

79
00:04:43,701 --> 00:04:47,036
I don't want you listening
to this distracting nonsense.

80
00:04:47,121 --> 00:04:48,371
But it's their radio!

81
00:04:48,456 --> 00:04:51,249
And, technically, you said
I couldn't watch a match,

82
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:53,251
you didn't say anything
about listening to one.

83
00:04:53,335 --> 00:04:54,836
You...

84
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,421
You know what I meant.

85
00:04:56,505 --> 00:04:57,797
Anyway, shouldn't you...

86
00:04:57,882 --> 00:04:59,966
Shouldn't you be in bed by now?

87
00:05:18,277 --> 00:05:19,611
I think I'm doing it wrong.

88
00:05:19,904 --> 00:05:21,362
There's nothing to do.

89
00:05:21,447 --> 00:05:23,531
Let your mind and your spirit be free,

90
00:05:23,616 --> 00:05:25,825
for air is the element of freedom.

91
00:05:28,496 --> 00:05:30,079
Is something funny?

92
00:05:30,164 --> 00:05:32,207
Yeah, you're telling me
to embrace freedom,

93
00:05:32,291 --> 00:05:34,667
but you won't even let me
listen to the radio?

94
00:05:34,752 --> 00:05:36,961
And forget about leaving this island.

95
00:05:37,213 --> 00:05:39,589
Please, Korra. Look at Meelo.

96
00:05:39,673 --> 00:05:41,466
He's able to meditate peacefully.

97
00:05:45,054 --> 00:05:47,805
- Actually, I think he's asleep.
- What?

98
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:50,308
Well, at least he has
the relaxing part down.

99
00:05:50,434 --> 00:05:53,895
Whatever. None of this airbending stuff
makes any sense to me.

100
00:05:53,979 --> 00:05:57,690
I know you're frustrated, but
these teachings will sink in over time.

101
00:05:57,775 --> 00:06:00,360
Then one day, they'll just click.

102
00:06:03,948 --> 00:06:05,990
Yeah, it's not sinking in yet.

103
00:06:06,075 --> 00:06:07,659
I'm going to go get a glass
of lychee juice.

104
00:06:07,743 --> 00:06:09,953
Korra, the meditation's not over yet.

105
00:06:10,621 --> 00:06:12,413
Daddy, can I have
some lychee juice, too?

106
00:06:12,498 --> 00:06:13,540
No.

107
00:07:25,195 --> 00:07:27,530
Hey, what are you doing in my gym?

108
00:07:28,157 --> 00:07:30,867
Uh, I was just looking for a bathroom
and I got lost.

109
00:07:30,951 --> 00:07:33,411
Ah, the old "I-had-to-pee" excuse.

110
00:07:33,412 --> 00:07:36,414
You know, I'm sick and tired of you kids
sneaking in without paying.

111
00:07:36,415 --> 00:07:37,999
I'm taking you to security.

112
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:40,335
- No, wait...
- There you are!

113
00:07:40,419 --> 00:07:42,295
I've been looking everywhere for you.

114
00:07:42,421 --> 00:07:43,713
It's all right, Toza.

115
00:07:44,006 --> 00:07:45,965
- She's with me.
- Yeah, I'm with him.

116
00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:47,675
So, you see, we're together.

117
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:49,927
Well, not "together' together.
More like friends."

118
00:07:50,012 --> 00:07:52,055
Right, friends.
No, no, I didn't mean to imply...

119
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:53,139
- Oh, you implied it.

120
00:07:53,432 --> 00:07:56,434
I don't care what you are.
I've got work to do.

121
00:07:57,895 --> 00:08:00,438
Right this way, miss.

122
00:08:00,439 --> 00:08:01,856
Thank you, sir.

123
00:08:02,608 --> 00:08:04,442
Seriously, thanks!

124
00:08:06,987 --> 00:08:09,864
What do you think?
Best seats in the house, huh?

125
00:08:10,449 --> 00:08:12,867
Whoa, unbelievable!

126
00:08:14,119 --> 00:08:16,871
This place is even more amazing
than I imagined!

127
00:08:16,997 --> 00:08:19,457
- Name's Bolin, by the way.
- Korra.

128
00:08:19,667 --> 00:08:20,708
Psst.

129
00:08:20,793 --> 00:08:22,669
- Bolin.
- Yeah?

130
00:08:23,045 --> 00:08:26,464
I told you, you have to stop bringing
your crazy fan girls in here

131
00:08:26,465 --> 00:08:28,675
before the matches. Get her out of here.

132
00:08:29,051 --> 00:08:31,344
Aww, come on, Mako.

133
00:08:31,595 --> 00:08:34,389
All right, look, I kind of promised her
she could stay.

134
00:08:34,473 --> 00:08:37,475
But, man, I got a good feeling.
There's something special about her.

135
00:08:37,476 --> 00:08:39,102
I know it. Come here.

136
00:08:39,186 --> 00:08:41,479
I want you to meet my brother, Mako.

137
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:42,689
Mako?

138
00:08:42,773 --> 00:08:44,857
Wow, I heard you play on the radio...

139
00:08:44,942 --> 00:08:46,943
Come on, Bolin, we're up.

140
00:08:47,027 --> 00:08:48,903
Or I could meet him later.

141
00:08:49,071 --> 00:08:50,488
Yeah, sorry about that.

142
00:08:50,489 --> 00:08:53,700
My brother just gets real focused
before a match.

143
00:08:53,784 --> 00:08:55,493
Okay, I got to go!

144
00:08:55,494 --> 00:08:58,496
Wish me luck. Not that I'll need it.

145
00:08:58,956 --> 00:09:01,541
Good luck! Knock 'em out!

146
00:09:07,339 --> 00:09:11,801
Introducing the Fire Ferrets!

147
00:09:12,511 --> 00:09:14,846
I love you, Bolin!

148
00:09:15,264 --> 00:09:17,640
The rookie Ferrets came
from out of nowhere

149
00:09:17,725 --> 00:09:19,809
and have made it further than
anyone expected this season.

150
00:09:19,893 --> 00:09:22,687
But tonight they face
their toughest test yet, folks.

151
00:09:26,066 --> 00:09:27,066
And they're off!

152
00:09:27,151 --> 00:09:31,070
The two teams waste no time trying to
blast each other out of Zone 1 .

153
00:09:33,657 --> 00:09:36,659
Hasook is the first
to feel the heat of the Tigerdillos.

154
00:09:36,785 --> 00:09:39,704
He tries to return the favor,
but they're too fast for him,

155
00:09:39,788 --> 00:09:43,499
while Mako showcases his trademark
"cool under fire" style.

156
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:49,672
The Tigerdillos score with a walloping
one-two combo.

157
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:53,593
Can their teammate hold on
to their Zone 1 territory?

158
00:09:57,514 --> 00:09:59,891
Guess not! Mako's over the line.

159
00:09:59,975 --> 00:10:02,810
The Tigerdillos get the green light
and advance into Ferret territory.

160
00:10:03,312 --> 00:10:04,729
Come on, Ferrets!

161
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:09,609
- Looks like Hasook's in trouble.

162
00:10:09,693 --> 00:10:11,986
He's in Zone 3, teetering over the brink!

163
00:10:15,115 --> 00:10:18,451
And Hasook takes a dip!
He'll be back for Round 2,

164
00:10:18,535 --> 00:10:19,869
assuming the fabulous bending brothers

165
00:10:19,953 --> 00:10:21,704
can hold their ground
until the next round.

166
00:10:24,583 --> 00:10:30,213
Round 1 goes to
the Golden Temple Tigerdillos!

167
00:10:30,589 --> 00:10:32,590
Come on, Hasook, get your act together.

168
00:10:37,513 --> 00:10:39,055
The Fire Ferrets
are knocked into Zone 2

169
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:40,890
and the Tigerdillos advance.

170
00:10:58,492 --> 00:11:01,494
The Fire Ferrets cinch the round
in the closing seconds.

171
00:11:01,578 --> 00:11:02,620
It's one apiece.

172
00:11:02,621 --> 00:11:05,206
Still anyone's match
as we go into the third and final round.

173
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:12,463
Hasook stumbles and now he tumbles,
right into his teammate.

174
00:11:12,548 --> 00:11:15,341
He and Bolin better untangle quick
if they don't want to...

175
00:11:15,425 --> 00:11:16,705
Oh, too late!

176
00:11:17,636 --> 00:11:18,761
Oh, no!

177
00:11:19,054 --> 00:11:20,763
it's all up to Mako now.

178
00:11:20,848 --> 00:11:23,641
He's bobbing and weaving.
He's weaving and bobbing.

179
00:11:23,642 --> 00:11:25,142
But he's not hitting back.

180
00:11:25,227 --> 00:11:29,146
If Mako's knocked out,
the Ferrets' fabulous season is over.

181
00:11:29,898 --> 00:11:33,693
He's dancing on the edge of the ring,
surviving the three-on-one barrage.

182
00:11:33,777 --> 00:11:37,196
It seems his plan is to let
the Tigerdillos punch themselves out.

183
00:11:37,281 --> 00:11:39,240
- And his plan is working!

184
00:11:39,324 --> 00:11:40,491
Hahn is in the pool.

185
00:11:40,576 --> 00:11:44,370
They've got nothing left in the tank,
and Mako is on the offensive!

186
00:11:45,372 --> 00:11:46,664
It's two-on-one.

187
00:11:46,665 --> 00:11:48,374
Scratch that. It's one-on-one.

188
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:51,502
And it's an earth and fire slugfest!

189
00:11:51,879 --> 00:11:53,588
There's so much smoke and dust
from the fire fight...

190
00:11:54,673 --> 00:11:56,674
I can't even see
where the Fire Ferret is!

191
00:12:00,637 --> 00:12:02,077
It's a knockout!

192
00:12:02,097 --> 00:12:04,515
What a wing-dinger of a hat trick, folks!

193
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:08,561
Mako pulls off the upset of the season,
winning the match for the Fire Ferrets!

194
00:12:17,487 --> 00:12:18,821
Wahoo! Yes!

195
00:12:19,239 --> 00:12:22,950
One more win and
we're in the Championship Tournament.

196
00:12:23,827 --> 00:12:26,245
So what did you think, Korra?

197
00:12:26,330 --> 00:12:28,289
Bolin's got some moves, huh?

198
00:12:28,457 --> 00:12:30,917
What did I think? What did I think?

199
00:12:31,001 --> 00:12:32,627
That was amazing.

200
00:12:32,711 --> 00:12:36,422
You did more harm than good out there.
You almost cost us the match.

201
00:12:36,548 --> 00:12:38,132
- We won, didn't we?
- Barely.

202
00:12:38,216 --> 00:12:39,717
Get off my case, pal!

203
00:12:39,927 --> 00:12:40,927
Ugh!

204
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:42,470
Useless.

205
00:12:42,596 --> 00:12:47,266
You guys were incredible out there.
Especially you, Mr. Hat Trick.

206
00:12:47,351 --> 00:12:48,601
Oh, you're still here?

207
00:12:48,685 --> 00:12:50,478
Oh, you're still a jerk?

208
00:12:51,855 --> 00:12:52,855
Anyway.

209
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:54,774
I've been immersed in bending
my entire life,

210
00:12:54,858 --> 00:12:56,776
but I never learned
how to move like that.

211
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:59,236
It's like there's a whole new style here.

212
00:12:59,321 --> 00:13:00,863
Think you could show me a few tricks?

213
00:13:00,948 --> 00:13:03,741
- Absolutely.
- Right now?

214
00:13:04,368 --> 00:13:05,743
Come on, Bolin.

215
00:13:05,911 --> 00:13:07,036
Just ignore him.

216
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,455
Yeah, I can show you the basics.

217
00:13:09,539 --> 00:13:12,959
I'm just not sure how my earthbending
would translate to your waterbending,

218
00:13:13,043 --> 00:13:14,418
but we'll figure it out.

219
00:13:14,628 --> 00:13:16,754
Won't be a problem.
I'm actually an Earthbender.

220
00:13:17,756 --> 00:13:19,924
I'm sorry!
No, no, I didn't mean to assume.

221
00:13:20,008 --> 00:13:23,302
'Cause, you know, I was just figuring
with your Water Tribe getup

222
00:13:23,387 --> 00:13:26,472
that you are a Water Tribe gal.

223
00:13:26,682 --> 00:13:29,976
No, you're right, I'm a Waterbender.
And a Firebender.

224
00:13:30,435 --> 00:13:31,769
Mmm. Mm-hmm.

225
00:13:32,354 --> 00:13:33,938
I'm very confused right now.

226
00:13:34,773 --> 00:13:37,108
You're the Avatar, and I'm an idiot.

227
00:13:37,192 --> 00:13:38,859
Both are true.

228
00:13:39,778 --> 00:13:41,779
No way.

229
00:13:41,905 --> 00:13:43,531
The Avatar!

230
00:13:44,783 --> 00:13:47,368
All right, let's see what you got.

231
00:13:51,164 --> 00:13:53,791
That was great! Good power.

232
00:13:53,792 --> 00:13:56,794
But in a real match
you'd be a sitting turtle-duck.

233
00:13:57,129 --> 00:13:58,629
Not so upright and flat-footed.

234
00:13:58,714 --> 00:14:00,006
Stay light on your toes.

235
00:14:00,090 --> 00:14:03,467
Right up until the moment
when you need to dig in and strike.

236
00:14:03,552 --> 00:14:04,927
Then. Pop! Pop!

237
00:14:08,306 --> 00:14:10,099
Okay, let me try it again.

238
00:14:14,813 --> 00:14:17,565
Wow! Nice adjustment.

239
00:14:17,649 --> 00:14:19,775
- You're a natural at this.
- Not bad.

240
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:21,819
What's it take to impress this guy?

241
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:24,196
What? I said, "Not bad."

242
00:14:25,824 --> 00:14:27,283
You know what, it's getting late.

243
00:14:27,367 --> 00:14:28,909
I think I'm going to turn in.

244
00:14:28,994 --> 00:14:30,244
You kids have fun.

245
00:14:30,328 --> 00:14:33,330
Nice to meet you, Avatar Korra.

246
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:35,458
Yeah, been a real pleasure.

247
00:14:35,542 --> 00:14:36,751
See you upstairs, bro.

248
00:14:36,835 --> 00:14:38,836
Upstairs? You guys live here?

249
00:14:38,837 --> 00:14:40,671
Yep. In the attic.

250
00:14:40,756 --> 00:14:43,340
It's nothing fancy,
but we have some great views.

251
00:14:43,425 --> 00:14:45,342
So back to bending.

252
00:14:45,427 --> 00:14:47,720
Why don't you throw that combo
one more time?

253
00:14:58,857 --> 00:15:00,024
Patience, Korra.

254
00:15:13,246 --> 00:15:17,666
That was a 2000-year-old
historical treasure.

255
00:15:17,751 --> 00:15:20,294
What... What is wrong with you?

256
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:21,837
There's nothing wrong with me!

257
00:15:21,922 --> 00:15:23,923
I've been practicing,
just like you taught me.

258
00:15:24,007 --> 00:15:26,342
But it isn't sinking in, okay?

259
00:15:26,426 --> 00:15:28,385
It hasn't "clicked" like you said it would.

260
00:15:28,637 --> 00:15:30,846
Korra, this isn't something
you can force.

261
00:15:30,931 --> 00:15:32,252
If you would only listen to me...

262
00:15:32,265 --> 00:15:34,225
I have been! But you know what I think?

263
00:15:34,309 --> 00:15:35,851
Maybe the problem isn't me.

264
00:15:35,936 --> 00:15:38,187
Maybe the reason
I haven't learned airbending yet

265
00:15:38,271 --> 00:15:40,898
is because you're a terrible teacher.

266
00:15:42,859 --> 00:15:44,944
Yeah, you're a terrible teacher, Daddy.

267
00:16:01,044 --> 00:16:02,837
Okay, everyone here?

268
00:16:03,088 --> 00:16:05,214
Wait, where's Korra?

269
00:16:05,632 --> 00:16:08,509
Honestly, Pema,
I am at my wit's end with that girl.

270
00:16:08,593 --> 00:16:10,469
I don't know how to get through to her!

271
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:16,976
Dear, the best thing you can do right
now is to give Korra some space.

272
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:19,937
You must promise me that
your teenage years won't be like this.

273
00:16:21,773 --> 00:16:23,816
I will make no such promises.

274
00:16:30,532 --> 00:16:32,283
I didn't miss your match, did I?

275
00:16:32,367 --> 00:16:33,951
You guys look like you lost already.

276
00:16:34,035 --> 00:16:35,327
We might as well have.

277
00:16:35,412 --> 00:16:37,496
Hasook's a no-good no-show!

278
00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:42,376
You got two minutes to come out
ready to play or you're disqualified.

279
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:44,962
Well, there goes our shot
at the tournament.

280
00:16:44,963 --> 00:16:46,088
And the winnings.

281
00:16:46,339 --> 00:16:48,132
Can't you ask one of those guys
to fill in?

282
00:16:48,216 --> 00:16:51,510
No, the rules say you can only compete
on one team.

283
00:16:51,595 --> 00:16:53,971
Well, then how about me?

284
00:16:53,972 --> 00:16:56,974
I'm a top-notch Waterbender,
if I do say so myself.

285
00:16:57,058 --> 00:16:59,977
But you're the Avatar. Isn't that cheating?

286
00:16:59,978 --> 00:17:02,188
It isn't cheating if I
only do waterbending.

287
00:17:02,272 --> 00:17:05,608
No way. I'd rather forfeit
than look like a fool out there.

288
00:17:05,734 --> 00:17:08,736
Wow, thanks for the vote of confidence.

289
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:10,154
- Time's up. You in or out?
- We're in!

290
00:17:10,238 --> 00:17:11,322
- We are?
- Yes!

291
00:17:11,406 --> 00:17:12,489
Hey, I didn't agree to this...

292
00:17:12,574 --> 00:17:14,241
You can thank me later.

293
00:17:14,492 --> 00:17:16,076
This girl is crazy.

294
00:17:16,578 --> 00:17:18,746
Looks like the Fire Ferrets
have ferreted out

295
00:17:18,830 --> 00:17:20,623
a last-minute replacement Waterbender.

296
00:17:20,707 --> 00:17:22,416
Let's see if she's another
diamond in the rough

297
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,919
like the brothers
from the school of hard knocks.

298
00:17:25,587 --> 00:17:28,005
Don't do anything too fancy
or aggressive.

299
00:17:28,006 --> 00:17:29,548
In fact, don't do anything.

300
00:17:29,633 --> 00:17:31,842
Just try not to get knocked off the ring.

301
00:17:31,927 --> 00:17:33,510
You got it, Captain.

302
00:17:35,013 --> 00:17:36,931
Players, are you ready?

303
00:17:44,981 --> 00:17:46,023
Man overboard!

304
00:17:46,024 --> 00:17:50,027
Fire Ferret Waterbender, penalty!
Move back one zone!

305
00:17:50,111 --> 00:17:51,779
What? Why?

306
00:17:51,863 --> 00:17:56,033
You're only allowed to knock players off
the back of the ring, not over the sides.

307
00:17:56,034 --> 00:17:57,660
Oh... Whoops.

308
00:17:59,829 --> 00:18:02,039
And we're back in action
after that hiccup.

309
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:05,376
But I'm not so sure this replacement
player knows what she's doing.

310
00:18:06,795 --> 00:18:09,672
Foul! Over the line.
Move back to Zone 3.

311
00:18:10,048 --> 00:18:12,049
I'll show you over the line...

312
00:18:15,553 --> 00:18:18,013
The Platypus Bears take Round 1.

313
00:18:19,349 --> 00:18:21,976
The Platypus Bears know
a green player when they see one,

314
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:26,188
and they are focusing the brunt
of their bending on this poor girl.

315
00:18:29,276 --> 00:18:32,278
Wait a minute.
Did that Waterbender just earthbend?

316
00:18:35,073 --> 00:18:37,074
Foul. I think.

317
00:18:39,953 --> 00:18:41,433
Did I see that right?

318
00:18:41,454 --> 00:18:44,748
Hold on, folks, we're just
waiting for the referee's official call,

319
00:18:44,833 --> 00:18:47,084
but I think this replacement player
could be...

320
00:18:47,085 --> 00:18:50,087
Pardon me, everyone.
Have you seen Korra this evening?

321
00:18:50,088 --> 00:18:51,130
She's not in her room.

322
00:18:51,214 --> 00:18:52,631
You've got to be kidding me.

323
00:18:52,716 --> 00:18:54,550
She's the Avatar, folks!

324
00:18:54,634 --> 00:18:56,760
Playing in a Pro-bending match!

325
00:18:56,845 --> 00:18:58,512
Can you believe that?

326
00:18:58,596 --> 00:19:00,347
I'll get her myself.

327
00:19:02,475 --> 00:19:07,730
The Avatar will be permitted to continue
so long as she solely bends water.

328
00:19:12,444 --> 00:19:15,029
This girl may be the Avatar,
but she's no Pro-bender.

329
00:19:15,113 --> 00:19:17,990
And the Platypus Bears are
intent on exploiting that weakness.

330
00:19:18,074 --> 00:19:21,201
They're giving her their best and
her best ain't good enough to stop it!

331
00:19:21,328 --> 00:19:24,204
And she's in the drink!

332
00:19:32,547 --> 00:19:34,298
Oh, hey, Tenzin.

333
00:19:34,883 --> 00:19:37,134
I thought you didn't like
coming to these matches.

334
00:19:38,219 --> 00:19:41,347
Once again, you have
flagrantly disobeyed my orders.

335
00:19:41,431 --> 00:19:44,058
You were to stay on the island. Let's go.

336
00:19:44,142 --> 00:19:46,226
No. I'm kind of
in the middle of something.

337
00:19:46,353 --> 00:19:50,647
I have tried my very best to get through
to you by being gentle and patient.

338
00:19:50,732 --> 00:19:53,734
But clearly the only thing
you respond to is force.

339
00:19:53,818 --> 00:19:56,362
So I am ordering you to come back
to the temple. Right now.

340
00:19:56,446 --> 00:20:01,158
Why? So I can sit around and meditate
about how bad I am at airbending?

341
00:20:01,159 --> 00:20:04,453
You know, I'm beginning to think there's
a reason I haven't been able to learn it.

342
00:20:04,537 --> 00:20:06,997
Because maybe I don't even need it.

343
00:20:07,082 --> 00:20:09,708
What? That is a ludicrous suggestion.

344
00:20:09,793 --> 00:20:13,045
The Avatar needs to learn airbending.
It is not optional.

345
00:20:13,171 --> 00:20:17,174
No. This is what I need to learn.
Modern styles of fighting.

346
00:20:17,175 --> 00:20:20,177
Being the Avatar isn't
all about fighting, Korra.

347
00:20:20,261 --> 00:20:21,887
When will you learn that?

348
00:20:21,971 --> 00:20:23,764
I have a match to go finish.

349
00:20:24,974 --> 00:20:28,852
The Platypus Bears win Round 2.

350
00:20:28,937 --> 00:20:30,270
Round 3!

351
00:20:35,652 --> 00:20:37,194
The Platypus Bears
come out of the gate

352
00:20:37,195 --> 00:20:39,154
and quickly go after the Ferret brothers.

353
00:20:39,239 --> 00:20:42,199
They're corralled in the corner,
wedged in the edge of Zone 1,

354
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:44,201
unable to come to the Avatar's rescue.

355
00:20:44,202 --> 00:20:46,203
And, boy, does she need it!

356
00:20:51,751 --> 00:20:55,546
Looks like the Avatar's Pro-bending
debut is going to be cut short.

357
00:20:55,964 --> 00:20:59,716
She's been pushed back to Zone 3
and the water is calling her name.

358
00:20:59,884 --> 00:21:02,094
It's only a matter of time before...

359
00:21:02,178 --> 00:21:05,389
Hold the phone, stop the presses.
She's still in the game, folks!

360
00:21:05,515 --> 00:21:07,724
And she's moving like an entirely
different player!

361
00:21:07,809 --> 00:21:12,229
All of a sudden the Platypus Bears'
strikes are only striking air!

362
00:21:13,231 --> 00:21:14,982
How about that?

363
00:21:17,026 --> 00:21:19,111
The Platypus Bears have no juice left,

364
00:21:19,195 --> 00:21:21,697
but Mako and Bolin are
still fresh and juicy.

365
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:47,264
Knockout!

366
00:21:48,349 --> 00:21:51,727
The Fire Ferrets come
from way behind and steal the win.

367
00:21:51,811 --> 00:21:53,061
What an upset, folks.

368
00:21:53,146 --> 00:21:54,980
The rookies, Avatar in tow,

369
00:21:55,064 --> 00:21:57,691
have nabbed a place
in the Championship Tournament!

370
00:21:57,817 --> 00:21:59,776
I cannot believe it.

371
00:22:02,322 --> 00:22:03,697
- Yeah.
- Yes!

372
00:22:04,407 --> 00:22:06,783
Korra, what can I say?

373
00:22:06,868 --> 00:22:09,244
You really came alive in that last round.

374
00:22:09,329 --> 00:22:12,289
The way you dodged their attacks.
You are a natural.

375
00:22:12,290 --> 00:22:15,250
Thanks, but I can't take all the credit.

376
00:22:15,335 --> 00:22:17,419
Someone else taught me those moves.

377
00:22:25,386 --> 00:22:29,306
I'm really sorry about everything I said.

378
00:22:29,307 --> 00:22:33,185
I was really frustrated with myself
and I took it out on you.

379
00:22:33,311 --> 00:22:35,395
I think I owe you an apology, too.

380
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:39,399
I was trying to teach you about patience,
but I lost mine.

381
00:22:39,526 --> 00:22:40,609
No hard feelings?

382
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:42,444
Of course not.

383
00:22:42,570 --> 00:22:45,030
By the way,
you were really good out there tonight.

384
00:22:45,114 --> 00:22:47,074
You moved just like an Airbender.

385
00:22:47,158 --> 00:22:49,326
Wait, you stayed and watched?

386
00:22:49,327 --> 00:22:53,330
I did. Pro-bending turned out to be
the perfect teaching tool for you.

387
00:22:56,793 --> 00:23:00,087
I'll see you tomorrow
for airbending practice, bright and early!

388
00:23:00,171 --> 00:23:03,006
And by the way, I kind of
permanently joined the Fire Ferrets

389
00:23:03,091 --> 00:23:05,384
and we're playing in the tournament
in a couple of weeks.
