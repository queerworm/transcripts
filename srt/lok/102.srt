THIS PLACE IS EVEN
MORE AMAZING THAN I IMAGINED.

178
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,458
- NAME'S BOLIN,
BY THE WAY.

179
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:19,834
- KORRA.

180
00:08:19,875 --> 00:08:21,458
- PSST, BOLIN.

181
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:22,709
- YEAH.

182
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:24,542
- I TOLD YOU,
YOU HAVE TO STOP

183
00:08:24,583 --> 00:08:26,291
BRINGING YOUR CRAZY
FAN GIRLS IN HERE

184
00:08:26,333 --> 00:08:27,542
BEFORE THE MATCHES.

185
00:08:27,583 --> 00:08:28,792
GET HER OUT OF HERE.

186
00:08:28,834 --> 00:08:31,792
- AW, COME ON, MAKO.

187
00:08:31,834 --> 00:08:34,375
ALL RIGHT, LOOK, I KIND OF
PROMISED HER SHE COULD STAY.

188
00:08:34,417 --> 00:08:35,709
BUT, MAN, I GOT
A GOOD FEELING.

189
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:37,417
THERE'S SOMETHING
SPECIAL ABOUT HER.

190
00:08:37,458 --> 00:08:38,792
I KNOW IT.

191
00:08:38,834 --> 00:08:41,417
COME HERE, I WANT YOU
TO MEET MY BROTHER MAKO.

192
00:08:41,458 --> 00:08:42,750
- MAKO?

193
00:08:42,792 --> 00:08:44,917
WOW, I HEARD YOU PLAY
ON THE RADIO.

194
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:47,000
- COME ON, BOLIN,
WE'RE UP.

195
00:08:47,041 --> 00:08:48,917
- OR I COULD MEET HIM LATER.

196
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:50,583
- YEAH, SORRY ABOUT THAT.

197
00:08:50,625 --> 00:08:53,750
MY BROTHER JUST GETS
REAL FOCUSED BEFORE A MATCH.

198
00:08:53,792 --> 00:08:55,458
OKAY, I GOTTA GO.

199
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:56,875
WISH ME LUCK.

200
00:08:56,917 --> 00:08:58,333
NOT THAT I'LL NEED IT.

201
00:08:58,375 --> 00:09:00,041
- [chuckles]

202
00:09:00,083 --> 00:09:02,750
GOOD LUCK.
KNOCK THEM OUT!

203
00:09:07,417 --> 00:09:11,750
- INTRODUCING
THE FIRE FERRETS.

204
00:09:11,792 --> 00:09:15,125
- AHH!
I LOVE YOU, BOLIN!

205
00:09:15,166 --> 00:09:17,542
- THE ROOKIE FERRETS
CAME FROM OUT OF NOWHERE

206
00:09:17,583 --> 00:09:18,667
AND HAVE MADE IT FURTHER
THAN ANYONE

207
00:09:18,709 --> 00:09:20,125
EXPECTED THIS SEASON.

208
00:09:20,166 --> 00:09:23,291
BUT TONIGHT THEY FACE
THEIR TOUGHEST TEST YET, FOLKS.

209
00:09:25,959 --> 00:09:27,375
AND THEY'RE OFF.

210
00:09:27,417 --> 00:09:29,208
THE TWO TEAMS
WASTE NO TIME TRYING

211
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:33,792
TO BLAST EACH OTHER
OUT OF ZONE ONE.

212
00:09:33,834 --> 00:09:35,417
HASOOK IS THE FIRST
TO FEEL THE HEAT

213
00:09:35,458 --> 00:09:36,792
OF THE TIGER-DILLOS.

214
00:09:36,834 --> 00:09:38,375
HE TRIES TO RETURN
THE FAVOR,

215
00:09:38,417 --> 00:09:39,834
BUT THEY'RE TOO FAST
FOR HIM.

216
00:09:39,875 --> 00:09:41,792
WHILE MAKO SHOWCASES
HIS TRADEMARK

217
00:09:41,834 --> 00:09:44,750
"COOL UNDER FIRE" STYLE.

218
00:09:44,792 --> 00:09:46,208
- AAH!

219
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:48,000
- OH, THE TIGER-DILLOS SCORE

220
00:09:48,041 --> 00:09:50,750
WITH A WALLOPING
ONE-TWO COMBO.

221
00:09:50,792 --> 00:09:53,500
CAN THEIR TEAMMATE HOLD ON
TO THEIR ZONE ONE TERRITORY?

222
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:56,959
- [grunts]

223
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,208
[buzzer sounds]
- GUESS NOT.

224
00:09:58,250 --> 00:09:59,959
MAKO'S OVER THE LINE.

225
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,375
THE TIGER-DILLOS GET
THE GREEN LIGHT

226
00:10:01,417 --> 00:10:03,125
AND ADVANCE INTO
FERRET TERRITORY.

227
00:10:03,166 --> 00:10:05,792
- COME ON, FERRETS!

228
00:10:07,041 --> 00:10:08,542
- [grunts]

229
00:10:08,583 --> 00:10:09,875
- LOOKS LIKE
HASOOK'S IN TROUBLE.

230
00:10:09,917 --> 00:10:13,667
HE'S IN ZONE THREE,
TEETERING OVER THE DRINK.

231
00:10:13,709 --> 00:10:15,208
- AAH!

232
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:16,709
- AND HASOOK TAKES A DIP.

233
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:18,959
HE'LL BE BACK FOR ROUND TWO,

234
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,583
ASSUMING THE FABULOUS
BENDING BROTHERS

235
00:10:20,625 --> 00:10:23,000
CAN HOLD THEIR GROUND
UNTIL THE NEXT ROUND.

236
00:10:23,041 --> 00:10:24,500
[buzzer sounds]
[bell rings]

237
00:10:24,542 --> 00:10:28,291
- ROUND ONE GOES
TO THE GOLDEN TEMPLE

238
00:10:28,333 --> 00:10:30,125
TIGER-DILLOS.

239
00:10:30,166 --> 00:10:33,000
- COME ON, HASOOK,
GET YOUR ACT TOGETHER.

240
00:10:35,792 --> 00:10:37,417
[buzzer sounds]

241
00:10:37,458 --> 00:10:38,959
- THE FIRE FERRETS
ARE KNOCKED INTO ZONE TWO,

242
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,959
AND THE TIGER-DILLOS
ADVANCE.

243
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
- [grunts]

244
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,208
[buzzer sounds]

245
00:10:55,583 --> 00:10:56,875
[buzzer sounds]

246
00:10:56,917 --> 00:10:57,959
[bell rings]

247
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,917
THE FIRE FERRETS
CINCH THE ROUND

248
00:10:59,959 --> 00:11:01,583
IN THE CLOSING SECONDS.

249
00:11:01,625 --> 00:11:03,625
IT'S ONE APIECE,
STILL ANYONE'S MATCH

250
00:11:03,667 --> 00:11:05,625
AS WE GOT INTO
THE THIRD AND FINAL ROUND.

251
00:11:05,667 --> 00:11:06,834
[bell rings]

252
00:11:08,709 --> 00:11:10,000
HASOOK STUMBLES,

253
00:11:10,041 --> 00:11:12,583
AND NOW HE TUMBLES
RIGHT INTO HIS TEAMMATE.

254
00:11:12,625 --> 00:11:14,166
HE AND BOLIN BETTER
UNTANGLE QUICK

255
00:11:14,208 --> 00:11:15,417
IF THEY DON'T WANT TO--

256
00:11:15,458 --> 00:11:17,709
OH, TOO LATE!

257
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:18,875
- OH, NO.

258
00:11:18,917 --> 00:11:20,834
- IT'S ALL UP TO MAKO NOW.

259
00:11:20,875 --> 00:11:22,125
HE'S BOBBING AND WEAVING.

260
00:11:22,166 --> 00:11:24,041
HE'S WEAVING AND BOBBING.

261
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:25,709
BUT HE'S NOT HITTING BACK.

262
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:26,959
IF MAKO'S KNOCKED OUT,
THE FERRETS'

263
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,166
FABULOUS SEASON IS OVER.

264
00:11:30,208 --> 00:11:32,291
HE DANCING
ON THE EDGE OF THE RING,

265
00:11:32,333 --> 00:11:34,083
SURVIVING
THE THREE-ON-ONE BARRAGE.

266
00:11:34,125 --> 00:11:36,166
IT SEEMS HIS PLAN
IS TO LET THE TIGER-DILLOS

267
00:11:36,208 --> 00:11:37,291
PUNCH THEMSELVES OUT.

268
00:11:37,333 --> 00:11:39,291
AND HIS PLAN IS WORKING.

269
00:11:39,333 --> 00:11:40,667
HAHN IS IN THE POOL.

270
00:11:40,709 --> 00:11:42,083
THEY'VE GOT NOTHING
LEFT IN THE TANK,

271
00:11:42,125 --> 00:11:45,083
AND MAKO IS ON THE OFFENSIVE.

272
00:11:45,125 --> 00:11:46,834
IT'S TWO-ON-ONE.

273
00:11:46,875 --> 00:11:48,750
SCRATCH THAT,
IT'S ONE-ON-ONE.

274
00:11:48,792 --> 00:11:51,917
AND IT'S AN EARTH AND FIRE
SLUGFEST.

275
00:11:51,959 --> 00:11:54,500
THERE'S SO MUCH SMOKE
AND DUST FROM THE FIRE FIGHT,

276
00:11:54,542 --> 00:11:57,208
I CAN'T EVEN SEE
WHERE THE FIRE FERRET IS.

277
00:11:59,875 --> 00:12:01,208
[cheers and applause]

278
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:02,583
- IT'S A KNOCKOUT!

279
00:12:02,625 --> 00:12:05,250
WHAT A WINGDINGER
OF A HAT TRICK, FOLKS.

280
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:06,834
MAKO PULLS OFF
THE UPSET OF THE SEASON,

281
00:12:06,875 --> 00:12:10,041
WINNING THE MATCH
FOR THE FIRE FERRETS.

282
00:12:10,083 --> 00:12:12,959
[cheers and applause]

283
00:12:17,375 --> 00:12:19,041
- WHOO-HOO! YES!

284
00:12:19,083 --> 00:12:22,458
ONE MORE WIN AND WE'RE IN
THE CHAMPIONSHIP TOURNAMENT.

285
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:23,792
[snaps]

286
00:12:23,834 --> 00:12:26,250
SO WHAT'D YOU THINK, KORRA?

287
00:12:26,291 --> 00:12:28,083
BOLIN'S GOT
SOME MOVES, HUH?

288
00:12:28,125 --> 00:12:29,583
- WHAT DID I THINK?

289
00:12:29,625 --> 00:12:31,041
WHAT DID I THINK?

290
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:32,709
THAT WAS AMAZING.

291
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:34,500
- YOU DID MORE HARM
THAN GOOD OUT THERE.

292
00:12:34,542 --> 00:12:36,208
YOU ALMOST COST US
THE MATCH.

293
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:37,417
- WE WON, DIDN'T WE?

294
00:12:37,458 --> 00:12:39,709
- BARELY.
- GET OFF MY CASE, PAL.

295
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:41,166
UGH.

296
00:12:41,208 --> 00:12:42,583
- USELESS.

297
00:12:42,625 --> 00:12:44,625
- YOU GUYS WERE INCREDIBLE
OUT THERE.

298
00:12:44,667 --> 00:12:47,000
ESPECIALLY YOU,
MR. HAT TRICK.

299
00:12:47,041 --> 00:12:48,375
- OH, YOU'RE STILL HERE?

300
00:12:48,417 --> 00:12:50,125
- OH, YOU'RE STILL A JERK?

301
00:12:50,166 --> 00:12:51,834
- OOH.

302
00:12:51,875 --> 00:12:53,333
- ANYWAY...

303
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:55,041
I'VE BEEN IMMERSED
IN BENDING MY ENTIRE LIFE,

304
00:12:55,083 --> 00:12:56,917
BUT I NEVER LEARNED
HOW TO MOVE LIKE THAT.

305
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:59,250
IT'S LIKE THERE'S
A WHOLE NEW STYLE HERE.

306
00:12:59,291 --> 00:13:00,834
THINK YOU COULD SHOW ME
A FEW TRICKS?

307
00:13:00,875 --> 00:13:03,792
- ABSOLUTELY.

308
00:13:03,834 --> 00:13:05,792
- RIGHT NOW?
COME ON, BOLIN.

309
00:13:05,834 --> 00:13:07,375
- JUST IGNORE HIM.

310
00:13:07,417 --> 00:13:09,709
YEAH, I COULD SHOW YOU
THE BASICS.

311
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:11,583
I'M JUST NOT SURE
HOW MY EARTHBENDING

312
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:13,083
WOULD TRANSLATE
TO YOUR WATERBENDING,

313
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:14,166
BUT WE'LL FIGURE IT OUT.

314
00:13:14,208 --> 00:13:15,542
- WON'T BE A PROBLEM.

315
00:13:15,583 --> 00:13:17,709
I'M ACTUALLY
AN EARTHBENDER.

316
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:20,041
- I'M SORRY, NO, NO,
I DIDN'T MEAN TO ASSUME.

317
00:13:20,083 --> 00:13:21,625
'CAUSE I--YOU KNOW,
I WAS JUST FIGURING--

318
00:13:21,667 --> 00:13:24,291
WITH YOUR WATER TRIBE GETUP,
THAT YOU ARE

319
00:13:24,333 --> 00:13:26,542
A WATER TRIBE GAL.

320
00:13:26,583 --> 00:13:28,750
- NOPE, YOU'RE RIGHT.
I'M A WATERBENDER.

321
00:13:28,792 --> 00:13:30,000
AND A FIREBENDER.

322
00:13:30,041 --> 00:13:32,417
- MM. MM-HMM.

323
00:13:32,458 --> 00:13:34,125
I'M VERY CONFUSED
RIGHT NOW.

324
00:13:34,166 --> 00:13:37,208
- YOU'RE THE AVATAR,
AND I'M AN IDIOT.

325
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:39,125
- BOTH ARE TRUE.

326
00:13:39,166 --> 00:13:41,917
- NO WAY.

327
00:13:41,959 --> 00:13:45,041
THE AVATAR!

328
00:13:45,083 --> 00:13:47,750
ALL RIGHT, LET'S SEE
WHAT YOU GOT.

329
00:13:51,583 --> 00:13:53,959
THAT WAS GREAT.
GOOD POWER.

330
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,834
BUT, IN A REAL MATCH,
YOU'D BE

331
00:13:55,875 --> 00:13:57,041
A SITTING TURTLE-DUCK.

332
00:13:57,083 --> 00:13:58,875
NOT SO UPRIGHT
AND FLAT-FOOTED.

333
00:13:58,917 --> 00:14:01,625
STAY LIGHT ON YOUR TOES,
RIGHT UP UNTIL THE MOMENT

334
00:14:01,667 --> 00:14:03,583
WHEN YOU NEED TO DIG IN
AND STRIKE.

335
00:14:03,625 --> 00:14:06,542
THEN--
POP! POP!

336
00:14:08,667 --> 00:14:11,333
- OKAY, LET ME
TRY IT AGAIN.

337
00:14:15,041 --> 00:14:17,625
- WOW!
NICE ADJUSTMENT.

338
00:14:17,667 --> 00:14:19,125
YOU'RE A NATURAL AT THIS.

339
00:14:19,166 --> 00:14:20,417
- NOT BAD.

340
00:14:20,458 --> 00:14:21,875
- WHAT'S IT TAKE
TO IMPRESS THIS GUY?

341
00:14:21,917 --> 00:14:23,166
- WHAT?

342
00:14:23,208 --> 00:14:25,709
I SAID, "NOT BAD."

343
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:27,375
YOU KNOW WHAT,
IT'S GETTING LATE.

344
00:14:27,417 --> 00:14:29,208
I THINK I'M GONNA TURN IN.

345
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:30,625
YOU KIDS HAVE FUN.

346
00:14:30,667 --> 00:14:33,375
NICE TO MEET YOU,
AVATAR KORRA.

347
00:14:33,417 --> 00:14:35,709
- YEAH, BEEN A REAL PLEASURE.

348
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:37,750
- SEE YOU UPSTAIRS, BRO.
- UPSTAIRS?

349
00:14:37,792 --> 00:14:39,625
YOU GUYS LIVE HERE?
- YEP.

350
00:14:39,667 --> 00:14:41,250
IN THE ATTIC.

351
00:14:41,291 --> 00:14:43,375
IT'S NOTHING FANCY,
BUT WE HAVE SOME GREAT VIEWS.

352
00:14:43,417 --> 00:14:45,750
SO BACK TO BENDING.

353
00:14:45,792 --> 00:14:48,375
WHY DON'T YOU THROW
THAT COMBO ONE MORE TIME?

354
00:14:55,875 --> 00:14:57,083
- AAH!

355
00:14:57,125 --> 00:14:58,583
[grunting]

356
00:14:58,625 --> 00:15:00,166
- PATIENCE, KORRA.

357
00:15:00,208 --> 00:15:02,166
- [grunting]

358
00:15:02,208 --> 00:15:04,875
[yelling]

359
00:15:13,667 --> 00:15:18,083
- THAT WAS A 2,000-YEAR-OLD
HISTORICAL TREASURE.

360
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:20,709
WHAT--
WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?

361
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:22,250
- THERE'S NOTHING
WRONG WITH ME.

362
00:15:22,291 --> 00:15:24,542
I'VE BEEN PRACTICING,
JUST LIKE YOU TAUGHT ME.

363
00:15:24,583 --> 00:15:26,750
BUT IT ISN'T
SINKING IN, OKAY?

364
00:15:26,792 --> 00:15:28,709
IT HASN'T CLICKED
LIKE YOU SAID IT WOULD.

365
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:31,208
- KORRA, THIS ISN'T
SOMETHING YOU CAN FORCE.

366
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:32,375
IF YOU WOULD ONLY
LISTEN TO ME.

367
00:15:32,417 --> 00:15:33,667
- I HAVE BEEN.

368
00:15:33,709 --> 00:15:34,834
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK?

369
00:15:34,875 --> 00:15:36,458
MAYBE THE PROBLEM ISN'T ME.

370
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:38,709
MAYBE THE REASON I HAVEN'T
LEARNED AIRBENDING YET

371
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:41,375
IS BECAUSE YOU'RE
A TERRIBLE TEACHER.

372
00:15:41,417 --> 00:15:42,834
- [grunts]

373
00:15:42,875 --> 00:15:45,542
- YEAH, YOU'RE
A TERRIBLE TEACHER, DADDY.

374
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,291
WAH!

375
00:15:48,333 --> 00:15:50,917
AAH!

376
00:15:57,709 --> 00:15:59,917
- OKAY, EVERYONE HERE?

377
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:02,208
WAIT, WHERE'S KORRA?

378
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:05,041
- HONESTLY, PEMA, I AM AT
MY WIT'S END WITH THAT GIRL.

379
00:16:05,083 --> 00:16:07,959
I--I DON'T KNOW HOW
TO GET THROUGH TO HER.

380
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,291
- DEAR, THE BEST THING
YOU CAN DO RIGHT NOW

381
00:16:11,333 --> 00:16:13,917
IS TO GIVE KORRA SOME SPACE.

382
00:16:13,959 --> 00:16:15,542
- YOU MUST PROMISE ME
THAT YOUR TEENAGE YEARS

383
00:16:15,583 --> 00:16:18,458
WON'T BE LIKE THIS.

384
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:20,625
- I WILL MAKE
NO SUCH PROMISES.

385
00:16:27,417 --> 00:16:29,083
- I DIDN'T MISS YOUR MATCH,
DID I?

386
00:16:29,125 --> 00:16:30,709
YOU GUYS LOOK LIKE
YOU LOST ALREADY.

387
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:32,291
- WE MIGHT AS WELL HAVE.

388
00:16:32,333 --> 00:16:35,083
- HASOOK'S A NO-GOOD
NO-SHOW.

389
00:16:35,125 --> 00:16:37,333
- YOU GOT TWO MINUTES
TO COME OUT READY TO PLAY,

390
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:39,125
OR YOU'RE DISQUALIFIED.

391
00:16:39,166 --> 00:16:41,542
- WELL, THERE GOES OUR SHOT
AT THE TOURNAMENT...

392
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:43,000
AND THE WINNINGS.

393
00:16:43,041 --> 00:16:45,166
- CAN'T YOU ASK
ONE OF THOSE GUYS TO FILL IN?

394
00:16:45,208 --> 00:16:48,250
- NO, THE RULES SAY YOU CAN
ONLY COMPETE ON ONE TEAM.

395
00:16:48,291 --> 00:16:50,667
- WELL, THEN...
HOW ABOUT ME?

396
00:16:50,709 --> 00:16:53,709
I'M A TOP-NOTCH WATERBENDER,
IF I DO SAY SO MYSELF.

397
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:55,375
- BUT YOU'RE THE AVATAR.

398
00:16:55,417 --> 00:16:56,917
ISN'T THAT CHEATING?

399
00:16:56,959 --> 00:16:59,000
- IT ISN'T CHEATING
IF I ONLY DO WATERBENDING.

400
00:16:59,041 --> 00:17:00,750
- NO WAY,
I'D RATHER FORFEIT

401
00:17:00,792 --> 00:17:02,417
THAN LOOK LIKE
A FOOL OUT THERE.

402
00:17:02,458 --> 00:17:05,709
- WOW, THANKS FOR THE VOTE
OF CONFIDENCE.

403
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:07,500
- TIME'S UP,
YOU IN OR OUT?

404
00:17:07,542 --> 00:17:09,709
- WE'RE IN.
- WE ARE?
- YES!
- HEY, I DIDN'T AGREE TO THIS.

405
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:11,000
- YOU CAN THANK ME LATER.

406
00:17:11,041 --> 00:17:13,125
- THIS GIRL IS CRAZY.

407
00:17:13,166 --> 00:17:15,542
- LOOKS LIKE THE FIRE FERRETS
HAVE FERRETED OUT

408
00:17:15,583 --> 00:17:17,542
A LAST-MINUTE
REPLACEMENT WATERBENDER.

409
00:17:17,583 --> 00:17:19,333
LET'S SEE IF SHE'S ANOTHER
DIAMOND IN THE ROUGH,

410
00:17:19,375 --> 00:17:21,709
LIKE THE BROTHERS FROM
THE SCHOOL OF HARD KNOCKS.

411
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:24,542
- DON'T DO ANYTHING
TOO FANCY OR AGGRESSIVE.

412
00:17:24,583 --> 00:17:26,250
IN FACT, DON'T DO ANYTHING.

413
00:17:26,291 --> 00:17:28,333
JUST TRY NOT TO GET
KNOCKED OFF THE RING.

414
00:17:28,375 --> 00:17:31,458
- YOU GOT IT, CAPTAIN.

415
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,208
- PLAYERS, ARE YOU READY?

416
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:34,417
[whistle blows]

417
00:17:34,458 --> 00:17:36,875
[bell rings]

418
00:17:36,917 --> 00:17:38,166
- AAH!

419
00:17:38,208 --> 00:17:40,417
[splashes]

420
00:17:40,458 --> 00:17:41,625
- WHOO-HOO!

421
00:17:41,667 --> 00:17:42,959
MAN OVERBOARD.

422
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,959
- FIRE FERRET WATERBENDER,
PENALTY.

423
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,667
MOVE BACK ONE ZONE.

424
00:17:46,709 --> 00:17:48,542
- WHAT?
WHY?

425
00:17:48,583 --> 00:17:49,917
- YOU'RE ONLY ALLOWED
TO KNOCK PLAYERS

426
00:17:49,959 --> 00:17:52,458
OFF THE BACK OF THE RING,
NOT OVER THE SIDES.

427
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:54,458
- OH, WHOOPS.

428
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:56,083
[bell rings]

429
00:17:56,125 --> 00:17:59,041
- AND WE'RE BACK IN ACTION
AFTER THAT HICCUP.

430
00:17:59,083 --> 00:18:00,875
BUT I'M NOT SO SURE
THIS REPLACEMENT PLAYER

431
00:18:00,917 --> 00:18:02,667
KNOWS WHAT SHE'S DOING.

432
00:18:02,709 --> 00:18:04,750
[buzzer sounds]
- FOUL, OVER THE LINE.

433
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:06,458
MOVE BACK TO ZONE THREE.

434
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,875
- I'LL SHOW YOU
OVER THE LINE.

435
00:18:08,917 --> 00:18:10,166
[audience booing]

436
00:18:10,208 --> 00:18:12,375
[bell rings]

437
00:18:12,417 --> 00:18:16,291
- THE PLATYPUS-BEARS
TAKE ROUND ONE.

438
00:18:16,333 --> 00:18:17,792
THE PLATYPUS-BEARS
KNOW A GREEN PLAYER

439
00:18:17,834 --> 00:18:19,291
WHEN THEY SEE ONE.

440
00:18:19,333 --> 00:18:21,125
AND THEY ARE FOCUSING
THE BRUNT OF THEIR BENDING

441
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:24,458
ON THIS POOR GIRL.

442
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:26,291
- [growls]

443
00:18:26,333 --> 00:18:28,750
- WAIT A MINUTE, DID THAT
WATERBENDER JUST EARTHBEND?

444
00:18:28,792 --> 00:18:30,500
[gasping]

445
00:18:30,542 --> 00:18:31,750
[whistle blows]

446
00:18:31,792 --> 00:18:34,000
- FOUL, I THINK.

447
00:18:34,041 --> 00:18:36,583
- [chuckles]

448
00:18:36,625 --> 00:18:38,291
- DID I SEE THAT RIGHT?
- [sighs]

449
00:18:38,333 --> 00:18:39,792
- HOLD ON, FOLKS,
WE'RE JUST WAITING

450
00:18:39,834 --> 00:18:41,083
FOR THE REFEREES'
OFFICIAL CALL,

451
00:18:41,125 --> 00:18:43,750
BUT I THINK THIS
REPLACEMENT PLAYER COULD BE--

452
00:18:43,792 --> 00:18:45,417
- PARDON ME, EVERYONE,
HAVE YOU SEEN

453
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:47,166
KORRA THIS EVENING?

454
00:18:47,208 --> 00:18:49,375
SHE'S NOT IN HER ROOM.
- YOU'VE GOTTA BE KIDDING ME.

455
00:18:49,417 --> 00:18:51,291
SHE'S THE AVATAR, FOLKS!

456
00:18:51,333 --> 00:18:53,291
PLAYING IN
A PRO BENDING MATCH.

457
00:18:53,333 --> 00:18:55,291
CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT?

458
00:18:55,333 --> 00:18:59,208
- I'LL GET HER MYSELF.

459
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:01,834
- THE AVATAR WILL BE
PERMITTED TO CONTINUE,

460
00:19:01,875 --> 00:19:04,291
SO LONG AS SHE SOLELY
BENDS WATER.

461
00:19:04,333 --> 00:19:06,208
all: AWW.

462
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:09,375
[bell rings]

463
00:19:09,417 --> 00:19:10,458
- THIS GIRL MAY BE
THE AVATAR,

464
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:11,875
BUT SHE'S NO PRO BENDER.

465
00:19:11,917 --> 00:19:13,208
AND THE PLATYPUS-BEARS
ARE INTENT

466
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:15,166
ON EXPLOITING THAT WEAKNESS.

467
00:19:15,208 --> 00:19:16,667
THEY'RE GIVING HER
THEIR BEST,

468
00:19:16,709 --> 00:19:18,166
AND HER BEST AIN'T GOOD ENOUGH
TO STOP IT.

469
00:19:18,208 --> 00:19:19,333
[buzzer sounds]

470
00:19:19,375 --> 00:19:22,291
AND SHE'S IN THE DRINK.

471
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,917
- [grunts]

472
00:19:29,166 --> 00:19:31,125
OH, HEY, TENZIN.

473
00:19:31,166 --> 00:19:34,458
I THOUGHT YOU DIDN'T
LIKE COMING TO THESE MATCHES.

474
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:36,667
- ONCE AGAIN,
YOU HAVE FLAGRANTLY

475
00:19:36,709 --> 00:19:38,375
DISOBEYED MY ORDERS.

476
00:19:38,417 --> 00:19:39,917
YOU WERE TO STAY
ON THE ISLAND.

477
00:19:39,959 --> 00:19:41,750
LET'S GO.
- NO.

478
00:19:41,792 --> 00:19:43,125
I'M KIND OF IN THE MIDDLE
OF SOMETHING.

479
00:19:43,166 --> 00:19:45,375
- I HAVE TRIED MY VERY BEST
TO GET THROUGH TO YOU

480
00:19:45,417 --> 00:19:47,583
BY BEING GENTLE AND PATIENT,

481
00:19:47,625 --> 00:19:50,583
BUT CLEARLY THE ONLY THING
YOU RESPOND TO IS FORCE.

482
00:19:50,625 --> 00:19:52,875
SO I AM ORDERING YOU TO COME
BACK TO THE TEMPLE RIGHT NOW.

483
00:19:52,917 --> 00:19:54,291
- WHY?

484
00:19:54,333 --> 00:19:55,709
SO I CAN SIT AROUND
AND MEDITATE

485
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:58,250
ABOUT HOW BAD I AM
AT AIRBENDING?

486
00:19:58,291 --> 00:19:59,792
YOU KNOW, I'M BEGINNING
TO THINK THERE'S A REASON

487
00:19:59,834 --> 00:20:01,250
I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE
TO LEARN IT.

488
00:20:01,291 --> 00:20:03,500
BECAUSE MAYBE I DON'T
EVEN NEED IT!

489
00:20:03,542 --> 00:20:04,709
- WHAT?

490
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:06,625
THAT IS
A LUDICROUS SUGGESTION.

491
00:20:06,667 --> 00:20:08,166
THE AVATAR NEEDS
TO LEARN AIRBENDING.

492
00:20:08,208 --> 00:20:09,583
IT IS NOT OPTIONAL.

493
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:12,291
- NO, THIS IS WHAT
I NEED TO LEARN.

494
00:20:12,333 --> 00:20:14,125
MODERN STYLES OF FIGHTING.

495
00:20:14,166 --> 00:20:17,000
- BEING THE AVATAR ISN'T
ALL ABOUT FIGHTING, KORRA.

496
00:20:17,041 --> 00:20:18,583
WHEN WILL YOU LEARN THAT?

497
00:20:18,625 --> 00:20:20,291
- I HAVE A MATCH
TO GO FINISH.

498
00:20:20,333 --> 00:20:21,834
[bell rings]

499
00:20:21,875 --> 00:20:25,125
- THE PLATYPUS-BEARS
WIN ROUND TWO.

500
00:20:25,166 --> 00:20:28,083
ROUND THREE.

501
00:20:32,291 --> 00:20:33,959
- THE PLATYPUS-BEARS
COME OUT OF THE GATE

502
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,917
AND QUICKLY GO AFTER
THE FERRET BROTHERS.

503
00:20:35,959 --> 00:20:37,625
THEY'RE CORRALLED
IN THE CORNER,

504
00:20:37,667 --> 00:20:39,417
WEDGED IN THE EDGE
OF ZONE ONE,

505
00:20:39,458 --> 00:20:40,917
UNABLE TO COME
TO THE AVATAR'S RESCUE.

506
00:20:40,959 --> 00:20:43,917
AND, BOY,
DOES SHE NEED IT.

507
00:20:43,959 --> 00:20:47,083
[cheers and applause]

508
00:20:47,125 --> 00:20:48,583
- [grunts]

509
00:20:48,625 --> 00:20:51,208
- LOOKS LIKE THE AVATAR'S
PRO BENDING DEBUT

510
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:52,542
IS GOING TO BE CUT SHORT.
- UGH.

511
00:20:52,583 --> 00:20:54,583
- SHE'S BEEN PUSHED BACK
TO ZONE THREE,

512
00:20:54,625 --> 00:20:56,625
AND THE WATER
IS CALLING HER NAME.

513
00:20:56,667 --> 00:20:58,542
IT'S ONLY A MATTER
OF TIME BEFORE--

514
00:20:58,583 --> 00:21:00,875
HOLD THE PHONE.
STOP THE PRESSES.

515
00:21:00,917 --> 00:21:02,834
SHE'S STILL
IN THE GAME, FOLKS.

516
00:21:02,875 --> 00:21:05,041
AND SHE'S MOVING LIKE
AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT PLAYER.

517
00:21:05,083 --> 00:21:06,583
ALL OFF A SUDDEN,
THE PLATYPUS-BEAR STRIKES

518
00:21:06,625 --> 00:21:09,875
ARE ONLY STRIKING AIR.

519
00:21:09,917 --> 00:21:11,542
- HOW ABOUT THAT?

520
00:21:13,917 --> 00:21:16,041
- THE PLATYPUS-BEARS
HAVE NO JUICE LEFT,

521
00:21:16,083 --> 00:21:18,500
BUT MAKO AND BOLIN
ARE STILL FRESH AND JUICY.

522
00:21:29,041 --> 00:21:32,166
- [grunting]

523
00:21:32,208 --> 00:21:34,125
[buzzer sounds]

524
00:21:36,166 --> 00:21:40,542
[buzzer sounds]

525
00:21:40,583 --> 00:21:42,500
[buzzer sounds]
- AAH!

526
00:21:42,542 --> 00:21:43,583
[bell rings]
- KNOCKOUT.

527
00:21:43,625 --> 00:21:44,875
- WHOO-HOO!

528
00:21:44,917 --> 00:21:47,375
- THE FIRE FERRETS
COME FROM WAY BEHIND

529
00:21:47,417 --> 00:21:48,917
AND STEAL THE WIN.

530
00:21:48,959 --> 00:21:50,417
WHAT AN UPSET, FOLKS.

531
00:21:50,458 --> 00:21:52,625
THE ROOKIES, AVATAR IN TOW,
HAVE NABBED A PLACE

532
00:21:52,667 --> 00:21:54,834
IN THE CHAMPIONSHIP
TOURNAMENT.

533
00:21:54,875 --> 00:21:58,166
I CANNOT BELIEVE IT.

534
00:21:58,208 --> 00:21:59,500
[laughter]

535
00:21:59,542 --> 00:22:00,917
- YES!
- YEAH!

536
00:22:00,959 --> 00:22:03,583
- KORRA, WHAT CAN I SAY?

537
00:22:03,625 --> 00:22:06,041
YOU REALLY CAME ALIVE
IN THAT LAST ROUND.

538
00:22:06,083 --> 00:22:07,792
THE WAY YOU DODGED
THEIR ATTACKS--

539
00:22:07,834 --> 00:22:09,250
YOU ARE A NATURAL.

540
00:22:09,291 --> 00:22:12,083
- THANKS, BUT I CAN'T
TAKE ALL THE CREDIT.

541
00:22:12,125 --> 00:22:13,959
SOMEONE ELSE TAUGHT ME
THOSE MOVES.

542
00:22:22,083 --> 00:22:24,041
I'M REALLY SORRY...

543
00:22:24,083 --> 00:22:25,834
ABOUT EVERYTHING I SAID.

544
00:22:25,875 --> 00:22:27,709
I WAS REALLY
FRUSTRATED WITH MYSELF,

545
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:29,709
AND I TOOK IT OUT ON YOU.

546
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:32,166
- I THINK I OWE YOU
AN APOLOGY TOO.

547
00:22:32,208 --> 00:22:34,667
I WAS TRYING TO TEACH YOU
ABOUT PATIENCE,

548
00:22:34,709 --> 00:22:36,208
BUT I LOST MINE.

549
00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:39,333
- NO HARD FEELINGS?
- OF COURSE NOT.

550
00:22:39,375 --> 00:22:41,709
BY THE WAY, YOU WERE REALLY
GOOD OUT THERE TONIGHT.

551
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:43,750
YOU MOVED JUST LIKE
AN AIRBENDER.

552
00:22:43,792 --> 00:22:45,917
- WAIT, YOU STAYED
AND WATCHED?

553
00:22:45,959 --> 00:22:47,250
- I DID.

554
00:22:47,291 --> 00:22:48,917
PRO BENDING TURNED OUT
TO BE THE PERFECT

555
00:22:48,959 --> 00:22:51,500
TEACHING TOOL FOR YOU.

556
00:22:53,583 --> 00:22:55,333
- I'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW
FOR AIRBENDING PRACTICE.

557
00:22:55,375 --> 00:22:57,000
BRIGHT AND EARLY.

558
00:22:57,041 --> 00:22:59,250
AND, BY THE WAY, I KIND OF
PERMANENTLY JOINED

559
00:22:59,291 --> 00:23:00,792
THE FIRE FERRETS, AND
WE'RE PLAYING IN THE TOURNAMENT

560
00:23:00,834 --> 00:23:02,000
IN A COUPLE OF WEEKS.

561
00:23:02,041 --> 00:23:03,959
- [sighs]
