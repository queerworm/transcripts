175
00:07:57,542 --> 00:07:59,500
HE WAS JUST A LITTLE KID.

176
00:07:59,542 --> 00:08:00,542
- AND HE WASN'T ALONE.

177
00:08:00,583 --> 00:08:02,375
HE HAD HIS FRIENDS TO HELP HIM.

178
00:08:02,417 --> 00:08:06,125
LOOK, THE ARENA MIGHT BE SHUT
DOWN, BUT WE'RE STILL A TEAM.

179
00:08:06,166 --> 00:08:07,834
THE NEW TEAM AVATAR!

180
00:08:07,875 --> 00:08:09,875
- WE'VE GOT YOUR BACK, KORRA.

181
00:08:09,917 --> 00:08:12,125
AND WE CAN SAVE
THE CITY. TOGETHER.

182
00:08:12,166 --> 00:08:13,917
- YEAH.

183
00:08:13,959 --> 00:08:15,333
LET'S DO IT.

184
00:08:15,375 --> 00:08:16,917
- [flatulence]

185
00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:18,333
YEAH, LET'S DO IT!

186
00:08:18,375 --> 00:08:19,375
[flatulence]

187
00:08:19,417 --> 00:08:20,375
WHAT ARE WE DOING?

188
00:08:20,417 --> 00:08:26,333
[all laugh]

189
00:08:26,375 --> 00:08:28,250
- GET READY, REPUBLIC CITY.

190
00:08:28,291 --> 00:08:32,875
YOU ARE ABOUT TO BE PATROLLED BY
TEAM AVATAR.

191
00:08:32,917 --> 00:08:36,291
- ASAMI, YOU ALWAYS KNOW HOW TO
ACCESSORIZE YOUR OUTFITS.

192
00:08:36,333 --> 00:08:38,375
- I FIGURE ONE WAY
TO FIGHT EQUALISTS

193
00:08:38,417 --> 00:08:40,083
IS TO USE AN EQUALIST'S WEAPON.

194
00:08:40,125 --> 00:08:41,250
[electricity crackles]

195
00:08:41,291 --> 00:08:42,917
- ALL RIGHT.

196
00:08:42,959 --> 00:08:44,458
LET'S RIDE.

197
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:46,208
- NAGA, AWAY!

198
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:49,250
all: WHOA! OOF!

199
00:08:49,291 --> 00:08:50,542
- ALL RIGHT, SCRATCH THAT.

200
00:08:50,583 --> 00:08:51,792
ANY OTHER IDEAS?

201
00:08:51,834 --> 00:08:55,375
- HMM, I THINK
I HAVE THE ANSWER.

202
00:08:55,417 --> 00:09:00,375
[door creaks]

203
00:09:00,417 --> 00:09:01,875
[engine roars]

204
00:09:01,917 --> 00:09:07,750
[tires screech]

205
00:09:07,792 --> 00:09:13,917
YOU THINK THIS'LL DO?

206
00:09:13,959 --> 00:09:16,291
- I LIKE THE NEW
TEAM AVATAR'S STYLE.

207
00:09:28,709 --> 00:09:30,750
- [over radio]
UNIT 216?

208
00:09:30,792 --> 00:09:32,709
CANCEL THAT 1058
AT HARMONY TOWER.

209
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:34,417
COME BACK TO THE STATION. OVER.

210
00:09:34,458 --> 00:09:37,375
- MY DAD HAD POLICE SCANNERS
INSTALLED IN ALL OF HIS CARS.

211
00:09:37,417 --> 00:09:39,333
I GUESS NOW I KNOW WHY.

212
00:09:39,375 --> 00:09:40,333
- [over radio]
CALLING ALL UNITS.

213
00:09:40,375 --> 00:09:41,542
LEVEL FOUR ALERT.

214
00:09:41,583 --> 00:09:42,542
JAIL BREAK AT HEADQUARTERS.

215
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:44,625
OFFICERS DOWN. ELECTROCUTED.

216
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:46,583
CHI-BLOCKERS AND EQUALIST
CONVICTS ARE STILL AT LARGE,

217
00:09:46,625 --> 00:09:47,750
ARMED AND DANGEROUS.

218
00:09:47,792 --> 00:09:50,417
LAST SEEN HEADING EAST.
- WHOA.

219
00:09:50,458 --> 00:09:51,792
- I REPEAT, LEVEL FOUR ALERT.
EQUALIST JAIL BREAK.

220
00:09:51,834 --> 00:09:52,834
[tires screech]

221
00:09:52,875 --> 00:09:55,125
- CHI-BLOCKERS! THAT'S THEM!

222
00:09:55,166 --> 00:09:58,667
- LET'S GET 'EM.

223
00:10:17,625 --> 00:10:19,417
[tires screech]
KORRA, BOLIN!

224
00:10:19,458 --> 00:10:22,709
GIVE ME A RAMP. NOW!

225
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:26,000
all: WHOA!

226
00:10:26,041 --> 00:10:27,875
- GAH!

227
00:10:39,834 --> 00:10:45,083
[gas hisses]

228
00:10:47,166 --> 00:10:51,000
- HELP ME OUT,
WE'VE GOTTA MAKE THIS TURN.

229
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:56,834
THEY DON'T KNOW
WE MADE THE TURN.

230
00:10:56,875 --> 00:10:59,750
OKAY, GET READY...

231
00:11:04,542 --> 00:11:09,125
[fire crackles]

232
00:11:09,166 --> 00:11:10,583
- OOF! AAGH!

233
00:11:10,625 --> 00:11:12,000
[groans]

234
00:11:12,041 --> 00:11:13,250
[electricity crackles]

235
00:11:13,291 --> 00:11:15,875
- [screams]

236
00:11:15,917 --> 00:11:18,792
- [grunts]

237
00:11:18,834 --> 00:11:19,959
[grunts]

238
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:20,959
- [grunts]
[electricity crackles]

239
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,667
[screams]

240
00:11:29,083 --> 00:11:30,250

[tires screech]

242
00:11:41,166 --> 00:11:44,166
[sirens wail]

243
00:11:47,834 --> 00:11:49,834
- AVATAR KORRA, WHAT DO YOU
THINK YOU'RE DOING?

244
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:51,625
- OH, HEY, TARRLOK.

245
00:11:51,667 --> 00:11:53,083
NICE OF YOU TO SHOW UP FINALLY.

246
00:11:53,125 --> 00:11:55,792
HERE, WE CAPTURED THE ESCAPED
CONVICTS FOR YOU.

247
00:11:55,834 --> 00:11:59,000
- WHAT YOU DID WAS TEAR UP
THE CITY AND IMPEDE

248
00:11:59,041 --> 00:12:00,959
THE REAL AUTHORITIES IN THEIR
PURSUIT OF THESE CRIMINALS.

249
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,083
- HMM, THAT'S FUNNY.

250
00:12:03,125 --> 00:12:07,500
I DIDN'T SEE YOUR
LITTLE TASK FORCE OR THE COPS
THE WHOLE TIME.

251
00:12:07,542 --> 00:12:10,792
IF IT WASN'T FOR TEAM AVATAR,
THEY WOULD HAVE GOTTEN AWAY.

252
00:12:10,834 --> 00:12:12,417
- THIS IS YOUR LAST WARNING.

253
00:12:12,458 --> 00:12:16,291
STAY OUT OF MY WAY.

254
00:12:16,333 --> 00:12:19,959
[engine starts]

255
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,792
REPUBLIC CITY STANDS
AS A BEACON OF FREEDOM,

256
00:12:23,834 --> 00:12:27,458
BUT THE EQUALISTS ARE USING THAT
FREEDOM TO TEAR IT DOWN.

257
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:30,750
THE LAW I HAVE PROPOSED WOULD
MAKE IT ILLEGAL FOR ANYONE

258
00:12:30,792 --> 00:12:34,792
TO BE A MEMBER OF THE EQUALISTS
OR EVEN BE ASSOCIATED WITH THEM.

259
00:12:34,834 --> 00:12:37,291
IT ALSO PUTS INTO
EFFECT A CURFEW,

260
00:12:37,333 --> 00:12:40,542
ENSURING ALL NON-BENDERS ARE IN
THEIR OWN HOMES BY NIGHTFALL.

261
00:12:40,583 --> 00:12:42,417
- THIS IS GOING
TOO FAR, TARRLOK.

262
00:12:42,458 --> 00:12:45,417
YOU CAN'T PUNISH ALL NON-BENDERS
FOR THE ACTIONS OF A FEW.

263
00:12:45,458 --> 00:12:48,583
- THAT KIND OF COWARDICE
WILL CAUSE OUR CITY

264
00:12:48,625 --> 00:12:50,792
TO FALL INTO AMON'S HANDS.

265
00:12:50,834 --> 00:12:52,709
WE MUST PASS THIS LAW.

266
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:55,375
ALL IN FAVOR?

267
00:12:59,375 --> 00:13:01,542
- [angry sigh]

268
00:13:13,625 --> 00:13:15,083
- [over radio]
ALL AVAILABLE UNITS,

269
00:13:15,125 --> 00:13:17,875
PLEASE RESPOND TO THE 5600 BLOCK
OF DRAGON FLATS BOROUGH.

270
00:13:17,917 --> 00:13:19,458
EQUALISTS HAVE TAKEN
TO THE STREETS.

271
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,208
CONSIDER THEM ARMED
AND DANGEROUS.

272
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:22,166
PROCEED WITH CAUTION.

273
00:13:22,208 --> 00:13:23,166
- I CALL FRONT!

274
00:13:23,208 --> 00:13:24,542
- AFTER YOU.

275
00:13:24,583 --> 00:13:25,375
- WHAT A GENTLEMAN.

276
00:13:25,417 --> 00:13:28,875
THANKS.

277
00:13:41,041 --> 00:13:46,959
WHY IS THE POWER OUT?

278
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,583
[distant murmurs]

279
00:13:53,959 --> 00:13:58,000
[angry chattering]

280
00:13:58,041 --> 00:14:00,917
- WAIT A SECOND, THESE PEOPLE
AREN'T ARMED OR DANGEROUS.

281
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:03,417
- SURE DOESN'T LOOK THAT WAY.

282
00:14:03,458 --> 00:14:07,291
- ALL NON-BENDERS, RETURN TO
YOUR HOMES IMMEDIATELY.

283
00:14:07,333 --> 00:14:09,792
- YEAH, AS SOON AS YOU TURN OUR
POWER BACK ON.

284
00:14:09,834 --> 00:14:11,000
all: YEAH!

285
00:14:11,041 --> 00:14:13,917
- DISPERSE OR YOU WILL
ALL BE ARRESTED.

286
00:14:13,959 --> 00:14:16,041
- YOU BENDERS CAN'T
TREAT US THIS WAY.

287
00:14:16,083 --> 00:14:17,250
- MOMMY, LOOK.

288
00:14:17,291 --> 00:14:19,291
IT'S THE AVATAR.

289
00:14:19,333 --> 00:14:21,667
- PLEASE, HELP US.

290
00:14:21,709 --> 00:14:25,250
YOU'RE OUR AVATAR TOO.

291
00:14:29,166 --> 00:14:30,917
- EVERYONE PLEASE STAY CALM.

292
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:33,250
I'M GONNA PUT A STOP TO THIS.

293
00:14:40,542 --> 00:14:42,667
TARRLOK.

294
00:14:42,709 --> 00:14:45,458
YOU NEED TO TURN THE POWER BACK
ON AND LEAVE THESE PEOPLE ALONE.

295
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:48,834
- AVATAR KORRA, YOU AND YOUR
PLAYMATES HAVE NO BUSINESS HERE.

296
00:14:48,875 --> 00:14:50,917
- WE'RE NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

297
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:52,166
YOU DON'T HAVE THE RIGHT
TO TREAT THESE

298
00:14:52,208 --> 00:14:53,709
INNOCENT PEOPLE
LIKE CRIMINALS.

299
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:55,625
- THIS IS AN EQUALIST RALLY.

300
00:14:55,667 --> 00:14:57,083
THERE'S NOTHING
INNOCENT ABOUT IT.

301
00:14:57,125 --> 00:14:59,166
- THEY'RE NOT EQUALISTS.

302
00:14:59,208 --> 00:15:01,208
THEY'RE JUST NORMAL PEOPLE WHO
WANT THEIR RIGHTS BACK.

303
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:03,458
- THEY ARE THE ENEMY.

304
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:07,000
ROUND UP ALL THESE EQUALISTS.

305
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:15,000
[scared chattering]

306
00:15:21,959 --> 00:15:27,875
[all scream]

307
00:15:29,375 --> 00:15:34,458
- STOP!

308
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:37,792
- [growls]

309
00:15:41,291 --> 00:15:43,333
- [grunts]

310
00:15:43,375 --> 00:15:44,792
HEY, LET ME GO.

311
00:15:44,834 --> 00:15:45,792
- YOU'RE UNDER ARREST.

312
00:15:45,834 --> 00:15:47,917
- WHAT? YOU CAN'T DO THAT.

313
00:15:47,959 --> 00:15:49,792
- ACTUALLY, I CAN.

314
00:15:49,834 --> 00:15:51,709
SHE'S A NON-BENDER
OUT PAST CURFEW

315
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:53,500
AND HER FATHER IS A KNOWN
EQUALIST CONSPIRATOR.

316
00:15:53,542 --> 00:15:54,750
- LET HER GO.

317
00:15:54,792 --> 00:15:59,458
- ARREST HIM AND HIS BROTHER.

318
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:04,834
- TARRLOK!

319
00:16:04,875 --> 00:16:07,500
- UNLESS YOU WANT TO JOIN YOUR
FRIENDS IN PRISON,

320
00:16:07,542 --> 00:16:11,000
I SUGGEST YOU PUT THOSE DOWN AND
GO BACK TO THE AIR TEMPLE.

321
00:16:11,041 --> 00:16:12,667
- KORRA, LISTEN TO HIM.

322
00:16:12,709 --> 00:16:18,667
IT'S NOT WORTH IT.

323
00:16:18,709 --> 00:16:20,500
- WE'LL BE ALL RIGHT.

324
00:16:20,542 --> 00:16:22,333
- DON'T WORRY, I'LL CALL TENZIN.

325
00:16:22,375 --> 00:16:25,709
HE CAN GET YOU OUT.

326
00:16:31,417 --> 00:16:35,458
- SO SAD TO SEE YOUR LITTLE
"TEAM AVATAR" BROKEN UP.

327
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:36,875
YOU HAD A GOOD RUN.

328
00:16:36,917 --> 00:16:38,834
- THIS ISN'T OVER, TARRLOK.

329
00:16:38,875 --> 00:16:41,709
- OH, I BELIEVE IT IS.

330
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:42,750
TAKE THEM AWAY.

331
00:16:42,792 --> 00:16:48,625
[sirens wail]

332
00:17:07,667 --> 00:17:08,709
- HEY!

333
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:10,333
- I CAME AS FAST AS I COULD.

334
00:17:10,375 --> 00:17:12,417
ARE YOUR FRIENDS ALL RIGHT?
- I DON'T KNOW.

335
00:17:12,458 --> 00:17:14,166
THESE KNUCKLEHEADS WON'T TELL ME
ANYTHING.

336
00:17:14,208 --> 00:17:18,500
- I'LL TAKE CARE OF THIS.

337
00:17:18,542 --> 00:17:19,750
- [nervous gasp]

338
00:17:19,792 --> 00:17:21,500
- SAIKHAN, A WORD PLEASE.

339
00:17:21,542 --> 00:17:24,917
- COUNCILMAN TENZIN, I'M PRETTY
SWAMPED AT THE MOMENT.

340
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:27,500
CAN THIS WAIT?
- NO, IT CANNOT.

341
00:17:27,542 --> 00:17:30,417
THREE OF AVATAR KORRA'S FRIENDS
WERE WRONGLY ARRESTED TONIGHT.

342
00:17:30,458 --> 00:17:32,041
I'D LIKE YOU TO RELEASE THEM
IMMEDIATELY.

343
00:17:32,083 --> 00:17:33,750
- THEY'RE NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

344
00:17:33,792 --> 00:17:36,125
THEY WERE INTERFERING WITH
POLICE BUSINESS.

345
00:17:36,166 --> 00:17:38,750
- YOUR SO-CALLED "POLICE
BUSINESS" WAS ROUNDING UP

346
00:17:38,792 --> 00:17:41,333
INNOCENT PEOPLE AND CLAIMING
THEY WERE EQUALISTS.

347
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:43,000
THEY SHOULD BE RELEASED TOO.

348
00:17:43,041 --> 00:17:46,792
- ALL EQUALIST SUSPECTS ARE
BEING DETAINED INDEFINITELY.

349
00:17:46,834 --> 00:17:49,041
THEY'LL BE FREED IF
AND WHEN THE TASK FORCE

350
00:17:49,083 --> 00:17:50,542
DEEMS THEY ARE NO
LONGER A THREAT.

351
00:17:50,583 --> 00:17:54,125
- THOSE PEOPLE ARE ENTITLED TO
DUE PROCESS UNDER THE LAW.

352
00:17:54,166 --> 00:17:56,625
- YOU'LL HAVE TO TAKE THAT UP
WITH COUNCILMAN TARRLOK.

353
00:17:56,667 --> 00:17:58,125
- OH, I PLAN TO.

354
00:17:58,166 --> 00:18:01,375
AT THE COUNCIL MEETING,
FIRST THING IN THE MORNING.

355
00:18:01,417 --> 00:18:04,291
- YOU'RE OFFICIALLY THE WORST
CHIEF OF POLICE EVER!

356
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:05,500
- CALM DOWN, KORRA.

357
00:18:05,542 --> 00:18:06,542
I'LL GET THIS SORTED OUT.

358
00:18:06,583 --> 00:18:10,542
WE JUST NEED TO BE PATIENT.

359
00:18:10,583 --> 00:18:14,834
BUT YOU REALLY
ARE THE WORST! EVER!

360
00:18:23,041 --> 00:18:25,417
- [growls]

361
00:18:31,834 --> 00:18:33,750
WAKE UP, NAGA.

362
00:18:33,792 --> 00:18:34,834
LET'S GO.

363
00:18:44,583 --> 00:18:46,500
WAIT FOR ME HERE, GIRL.

364
00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:48,375
DON'T WORRY, I'LL BE ALL RIGHT.

365
00:18:55,625 --> 00:19:00,792
[door crashes open]

366
00:19:00,834 --> 00:19:02,458
YOU AND I NEED TO TALK.

367
00:19:10,083 --> 00:19:13,166
- ARE ANY OF THE OTHER COUNCIL
MEMBERS HERE?

368
00:19:13,208 --> 00:19:15,208
- I BELIEVE EVERYONE HAS GONE
HOME FOR THE NIGHT.

369
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:18,792
- THEN YOU SHOULD DO THE SAME.

370
00:19:18,834 --> 00:19:20,583
- ARE YOU SURE, SIR?

371
00:19:20,625 --> 00:19:24,959
- LEAVE US.

372
00:19:27,417 --> 00:19:28,667
[door closes]

373
00:19:28,709 --> 00:19:30,291
YOU OBVIOUSLY HAVE SOMETHING ON
YOUR MIND.

374
00:19:30,333 --> 00:19:31,291
SPIT IT OUT.

375
00:19:31,333 --> 00:19:33,083
- DON'T YOU SEE?

376
00:19:33,125 --> 00:19:36,291
YOU'RE DOING EXACTLY WHAT AMON
SAYS IS WRONG WITH BENDERS.

377
00:19:36,333 --> 00:19:38,792
YOU'RE USING YOUR POWER TO
OPPRESS AND INTIMIDATE PEOPLE.

378
00:19:38,834 --> 00:19:40,083
- AND YOU DON'T?

379
00:19:40,125 --> 00:19:42,542
- OF...OF COURSE NOT.

380
00:19:42,583 --> 00:19:44,750
- ISN'T THAT WHAT
YOU CAME HERE TO DO?

381
00:19:44,792 --> 00:19:49,041
INTIMIDATE ME INTO RELEASING
YOUR FRIENDS?

382
00:19:49,083 --> 00:19:52,291
SEE, THAT'S WHAT I ADMIRE
ABOUT YOU, KORRA.

383
00:19:52,333 --> 00:19:54,750
YOUR WILLINGNESS
TO GO TO EXTREMES

384
00:19:54,792 --> 00:19:56,834
IN ORDER TO GET WHAT YOU WANT.

385
00:19:56,875 --> 00:19:58,375
IT IS A QUALITY WE BOTH SHARE.

386
00:19:58,417 --> 00:20:00,792
- YOU AND I ARE NOTHING ALIKE.

387
00:20:00,834 --> 00:20:03,834
- LOOK, I'LL MAKE YOU A DEAL.

388
00:20:03,875 --> 00:20:06,750
YOU FALL IN LINE
AND DO WHAT I SAY

389
00:20:06,792 --> 00:20:08,166
AND I'LL RELEASE YOUR FRIENDS.

390
00:20:08,208 --> 00:20:10,000
- THAT'S WHY YOU ARRESTED THEM?

391
00:20:10,041 --> 00:20:11,083
TO GET TO ME?

392
00:20:11,125 --> 00:20:14,542
- I NEED YOUR ANSWER.

393
00:20:14,583 --> 00:20:15,959
- NO.

394
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,417
YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO MANIPULATE

395
00:20:17,458 --> 00:20:18,959
CHIEF SAIKHAN INTO
FOLLOWING YOU,

396
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,834
BUT IT WON'T WORK ON ME.

397
00:20:21,875 --> 00:20:24,875
- YOU WILL REGRET THAT DECISION.

398
00:20:24,917 --> 00:20:26,417
- YOU NEED TO BE STOPPED.

399
00:20:26,458 --> 00:20:29,583
YOU'RE JUST AS BAD AS AMON.

400
00:20:29,625 --> 00:20:31,917
- I'VE TRIED TO WORK
WITH YOU, KORRA,

401
00:20:31,959 --> 00:20:35,000
BUT YOU'VE MADE IT IMPOSSIBLE.

402
00:20:38,917 --> 00:20:41,208
- [grunts]

403
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:44,208
- UGH!

404
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:59,417
[ice shatters]

405
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:03,917
[clothes tear]
- AAH!

406
00:21:03,959 --> 00:21:09,917
AAH!

407
00:21:09,959 --> 00:21:15,917
[grunts]

408
00:21:15,959 --> 00:21:17,959
- OOF!

409
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
[screams]

410
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,583
- STILL THINK I'M
A HALF-BAKED AVATAR?

411
00:21:26,625 --> 00:21:30,208
- [screams]

412
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:35,959
- [grunts]

413
00:21:39,917 --> 00:21:41,417
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO NOW?

414
00:21:41,458 --> 00:21:43,375
YOU'RE ALL OUT OF WATER, PAL.

415
00:21:43,417 --> 00:21:45,417
- [nervous grunts]

416
00:21:45,458 --> 00:21:49,083
- [growls]

417
00:21:49,125 --> 00:21:51,625
[groans]

418
00:21:59,834 --> 00:22:01,834
- YOU'RE IN MY WAY, AVATAR.

419
00:22:01,875 --> 00:22:03,917
AND YOU NEED TO BE REMOVED.

420
00:22:03,959 --> 00:22:06,583
- [grunts]

421
00:22:06,625 --> 00:22:10,041
YOU'RE--YOU'RE A BLOODBENDER?

422
00:22:10,083 --> 00:22:13,000
- VERY OBSERVANT.

423
00:22:13,041 --> 00:22:15,667
- IT'S NOT A FULL MOON.

424
00:22:15,709 --> 00:22:18,959
HOW--HOW ARE YOU DOING THIS?

425
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:23,250
- THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS
YOU DON'T KNOW ABOUT ME.

426
00:22:23,291 --> 00:22:24,208
- UGH!

427
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:26,834
OOF!

428
00:22:38,667 --> 00:22:42,583
[groans]

429
00:22:42,625 --> 00:22:43,834
WHERE ARE YOU TAKING ME?

430
00:22:43,875 --> 00:22:46,667
- SOMEWHERE NO ONE
WILL FIND YOU.

431
00:22:46,709 --> 00:22:49,625
SAY GOODBYE TO REPUBLIC CITY,
AVATAR KORRA.

432
00:22:49,667 --> 00:22:51,500
YOU'LL NEVER SEE IT AGAIN.

433
00:22:51,542 --> 00:22:57,041
- [growls]

434
00:22:57,083 --> 00:22:58,792
YOU CAN'T DO THIS!

435
00:22:58,834 --> 00:23:00,417
LET ME OUT!

436
00:23:00,458 --> 00:23:02,375
[screams]
