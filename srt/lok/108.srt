1
00:00:01,418 --> 00:00:02,668
Earth.

2
00:00:03,253 --> 00:00:04,336
Fire.

3
00:00:04,963 --> 00:00:06,255
Air.

4
00:00:06,756 --> 00:00:08,173
Water.

5
00:00:08,967 --> 00:00:12,970
Only the Avatar can master
all four elements

6
00:00:12,971 --> 00:00:15,097
and bring baIance to the world.

7
00:00:20,979 --> 00:00:23,397
Republic City is at war!

8
00:00:23,481 --> 00:00:26,984
After discovering that her father,
Hiroshi Sato, is working with the enemy,

9
00:00:27,068 --> 00:00:28,694
Asami turns against him.

10
00:00:28,987 --> 00:00:31,572
And foIIowing another defeat
at the hands of the EquaIists,

11
00:00:31,656 --> 00:00:34,408
Lin Beifong resigns as chief of poIice.

12
00:00:34,492 --> 00:00:36,702
With the EquaIist army
growing stronger,

13
00:00:36,786 --> 00:00:40,539
who wiII heIp the Avatar stop Amon
and restore baIance to the city?

14
00:00:56,514 --> 00:00:58,515
You're finally here!

15
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,851
Welcome to Air Temple lsland,

16
00:01:00,935 --> 00:01:02,311
your new home.

17
00:01:02,395 --> 00:01:04,730
Yes! Welcome to my domain!

18
00:01:04,814 --> 00:01:08,025
Well, aren't you sweet, little monk child?

19
00:01:09,027 --> 00:01:10,486
What's that fuzzy creature?

20
00:01:11,946 --> 00:01:13,405
That is a fire ferret,

21
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:14,907
an arboreal mammal

22
00:01:14,991 --> 00:01:18,035
common to the bamboo forests
of the central Earth Kingdom.

23
00:01:18,411 --> 00:01:20,996
He's cute!

24
00:01:23,249 --> 00:01:25,959
Yip yip. Fly, sky bison. Fly!

25
00:01:27,629 --> 00:01:30,255
Thanks for sending the Air Acolytes
to help us with the move.

26
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:32,132
Yes, they've been amazing.

27
00:01:32,217 --> 00:01:34,051
Such tireless workers.

28
00:01:35,011 --> 00:01:36,929
l thought you were only bringing
a few things.

29
00:01:37,013 --> 00:01:39,056
Trust me, it could've been worse.

30
00:01:39,057 --> 00:01:42,351
No problem. Everyone here wants
you guys to feel welcome.

31
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:52,611
You're pretty.
Can l have some of your hair?

32
00:01:53,071 --> 00:01:55,656
Looks like l have some competition.

33
00:01:56,491 --> 00:01:58,242
And now for the grand tour!

34
00:01:58,618 --> 00:02:00,786
The flying bison sleep
in those caves down there,

35
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:02,412
and that's the temple
Grandpa Aang built,

36
00:02:02,497 --> 00:02:04,748
and that's the greenhouse
where we grow the vegetables we eat.

37
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:07,626
l have a couple questions.
ls this an all-vegetarian island?

38
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:09,086
ls that where you train airbending?

39
00:02:09,087 --> 00:02:10,838
Do we have to wear Air Acolyte clothes?

40
00:02:10,922 --> 00:02:12,131
Do we each get our own sky bison?

41
00:02:12,215 --> 00:02:14,675
And final question,
how many trees are on this island?

42
00:02:15,718 --> 00:02:18,095
Yes, yes, no, no, 1 0,552.

43
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,432
So, where are we going to be staying?

44
00:02:22,517 --> 00:02:25,102
You're a boy.
Boys have to stay on the boys' side.

45
00:02:25,103 --> 00:02:27,521
l'd be happy to show you
to the men's dormitory!

46
00:02:27,605 --> 00:02:29,106
l'm a boy!

47
00:02:29,524 --> 00:02:32,067
Meelo, why don't you go
with the boys, too?

48
00:02:32,861 --> 00:02:35,487
We shall meet again soon,
beautiful woman.

49
00:02:36,281 --> 00:02:38,782
lkki and l will take you to your room,
this way.

50
00:02:44,706 --> 00:02:46,915
Asami, did you know Korra likes Mako?

51
00:02:52,213 --> 00:02:55,090
No, l wasn't completely aware of that.

52
00:03:02,473 --> 00:03:05,058
-Hey!
-Run along, lkki!

53
00:03:12,984 --> 00:03:14,359
So...

54
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:15,903
Here's your room.

55
00:03:16,154 --> 00:03:19,114
l know this is a little rustic
compared to what you're used to.

56
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:21,116
l think it's really charming.

57
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:22,951
And the best part about it?

58
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:25,329
Nothing here reminds me of my father.

59
00:03:25,413 --> 00:03:27,164
Thank you for your hospitality.

60
00:03:28,082 --> 00:03:30,167
lkki, l swear, if you don't leave us alone,
l'm gonna...

61
00:03:33,588 --> 00:03:35,672
Tenzin! Come right in!

62
00:03:36,174 --> 00:03:37,507
Good day, ladies.

63
00:03:37,592 --> 00:03:39,384
Asami, welcome to the lsland.

64
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:41,178
Thank you for having me.

65
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:43,972
Beifong's replacement, Saikhan,

66
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:47,100
is going to be inducted
as the new chief of police later.

67
00:03:47,185 --> 00:03:48,977
l think we should both be there.

68
00:03:50,188 --> 00:03:54,066
It was an honor serving under
Chief Beifong for so many years,

69
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:56,360
and I wish her a speedy recovery.

70
00:03:56,444 --> 00:03:57,945
It is with great humiIity

71
00:03:58,029 --> 00:04:00,948
that I take her pIace
as the new chief of poIice.

72
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:04,660
Republic City is facing a threat
like none the world has ever seen.

73
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:08,789
But there is one man who has been
effective against Amon's revoIution,

74
00:04:08,873 --> 00:04:10,666
Councilman Tarrlok.

75
00:04:12,418 --> 00:04:15,295
That is why, for aII matters
invoIving the EquaIists,

76
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:17,547
I wiII report directIy to him.

77
00:04:18,549 --> 00:04:21,843
The poIice department wiII Iend
any and aII avaiIabIe resources

78
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:26,473
to the Councilman and his task force,
untiI we queII this insurgency.

79
00:04:26,641 --> 00:04:30,018
What is that weasel-snake
Tarrlok up to now?

80
00:04:36,234 --> 00:04:39,528
Tarrlok, l don't know what you did
to get Chief Saikhan in your pocket,

81
00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:41,488
but l highly doubt it was legal.

82
00:04:41,572 --> 00:04:44,992
Tenzin, always the conspiracy theorist.

83
00:04:45,076 --> 00:04:48,453
Did you ever consider
Saikhan simply recognizes my talents

84
00:04:48,538 --> 00:04:50,330
and wants what is best for this city?

85
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:55,252
Well, Avatar Korra, long time no see.

86
00:04:55,253 --> 00:04:57,879
Now that your little Pro-bending
distractions are over,

87
00:04:57,964 --> 00:05:00,549
l look forward to your return
to my task force.

88
00:05:01,509 --> 00:05:05,345
Forget it. There's no way
l'm rejoining your vanity project.

89
00:05:05,847 --> 00:05:07,848
That is unfortunate to hear.

90
00:05:07,932 --> 00:05:09,891
But l am sure
you will come to your senses,

91
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:11,268
as you have in the past.

92
00:05:11,269 --> 00:05:13,020
Don't hold your breath, bub.

93
00:05:13,104 --> 00:05:15,731
You know,
Tenzin's been right about you all along.

94
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:17,774
You played me, you played Beifong,

95
00:05:17,859 --> 00:05:19,818
and now you're playing
the new Chief, too.

96
00:05:20,278 --> 00:05:21,278
Well, l got news for you.

97
00:05:21,362 --> 00:05:24,281
You need me, but l don't need you.

98
00:05:24,282 --> 00:05:25,532
l'm the Avatar.

99
00:05:25,616 --> 00:05:28,785
You are not, in fact, the Avatar.

100
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:33,123
You are merely
a half-baked Avatar-in-training.

101
00:05:33,207 --> 00:05:37,002
Which reminds me,
how is your airbending going?

102
00:05:37,086 --> 00:05:40,464
Made any significant progress with that?

103
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:43,759
l didn't think so.

104
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:46,136
lf you will not be part of my task force,

105
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:48,722
then you had best stay out of my way.

106
00:05:53,811 --> 00:05:56,229
l don't understand
what's wrong with me.

107
00:05:56,314 --> 00:05:58,315
l've memorized nearly
all of the practice forms,

108
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:02,069
but l still can't produce
a single, measly puff of air!

109
00:06:02,153 --> 00:06:03,362
l'm a failure.

110
00:06:03,446 --> 00:06:04,780
No, you're not.

111
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:07,407
You just need to work
through this airbending block.

112
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:10,619
Amazing advice. l'll get right on that.

113
00:06:10,703 --> 00:06:12,329
l wasn't finished yet.

114
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:14,748
You see, Aang not only had
his bending teachers,

115
00:06:14,832 --> 00:06:18,460
but also his past lives
to call upon for guidance.

116
00:06:18,544 --> 00:06:20,879
Have you ever made contact
with your past lives?

117
00:06:20,963 --> 00:06:22,881
No, of course l haven't.

118
00:06:22,965 --> 00:06:25,342
Didn't you get the memo
from the White Lotus?

119
00:06:25,343 --> 00:06:27,344
l'm a spiritual failure, too.

120
00:06:27,345 --> 00:06:30,180
You may have made a connection
without realizing it.

121
00:06:30,431 --> 00:06:33,266
Perhaps something
you mistook as a dream?

122
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:35,477
Maybe.

123
00:06:35,561 --> 00:06:38,063
l had a few weird hallucinations,

124
00:06:38,773 --> 00:06:40,357
but l hardly even remember them.

125
00:06:40,358 --> 00:06:43,318
And did you see any of the previous
Avatars in these visions?

126
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:45,487
l saw Aang.

127
00:06:45,571 --> 00:06:47,656
lt seemed like he was in trouble.

128
00:06:48,449 --> 00:06:50,033
What do you think it means?

129
00:06:51,536 --> 00:06:55,122
l don't know, but l urge you
to meditate on these visions.

130
00:06:56,124 --> 00:06:59,376
l believe Aang's spirit must
be trying to tell you something.

131
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:14,474
Korra! You out here?

132
00:07:17,061 --> 00:07:18,812
Korra!

133
00:07:23,401 --> 00:07:25,026
There you are.

134
00:07:26,571 --> 00:07:27,779
Are you okay?

135
00:07:27,864 --> 00:07:28,989
l'm fine.

136
00:07:29,073 --> 00:07:31,199
Come on, what's wrong?

137
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:32,409
You can tell us.

138
00:07:34,871 --> 00:07:38,415
How am l supposed to save the city
when l can't even learn airbending?

139
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:40,417
l'm the worst Avatar ever.

140
00:07:40,501 --> 00:07:43,378
l just feel alone.

141
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:46,131
No, that's nonsense. You're amazing!

142
00:07:46,215 --> 00:07:47,382
Yeah, and remember,

143
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:51,136
Aang hadn't mastered all the elements
when he was battling the Fire Nation.

144
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:52,387
He was just a little kid!

145
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:55,432
And he wasn't alone,
he had his friends to help him.

146
00:07:55,433 --> 00:07:59,311
Look, the arena might be shut down,
but we're still a team.

147
00:07:59,395 --> 00:08:01,188
The new Team Avatar!

148
00:08:01,272 --> 00:08:02,814
We've got your back, Korra.

149
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:05,442
And we can save the city together.

150
00:08:06,444 --> 00:08:11,698
Yeah, let's do it!

151
00:08:12,575 --> 00:08:14,159
What are we doing?

152
00:08:19,457 --> 00:08:21,458
Get ready, Republic City.

153
00:08:21,542 --> 00:08:25,212
You are about to be patrolled
by Team Avatar.

154
00:08:26,464 --> 00:08:29,424
Asami, you always know how
to accessorize your outfits.

155
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:33,470
l figure one way to fight Equalists is
to use an Equalist weapon.

156
00:08:34,889 --> 00:08:37,724
All right, let's ride.

157
00:08:37,808 --> 00:08:39,184
Naga, away!

158
00:08:42,897 --> 00:08:45,273
All right, scratch that. Any other ideas?

159
00:08:47,318 --> 00:08:48,735
l think l have the answer.

160
00:09:01,499 --> 00:09:02,958
You think this'll do?

161
00:09:07,004 --> 00:09:09,673
l like the new Team Avatar's style.

162
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:25,730
Unit 216,
canceI that 10-58 at Harmony Tower.

163
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:27,524
Come back to the station, over.

164
00:09:27,692 --> 00:09:30,902
My dad had police scanners
installed in all of his cars.

165
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:32,529
l guess now l know why.

166
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:34,531
Calling all units, level four alert.

167
00:09:34,532 --> 00:09:37,576
JaiIbreak at headquarters.
Officers down, electrocuted.

168
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:41,037
Chi-blockers and Equalist convicts
are stiII at Iarge, armed and dangerous.

169
00:09:41,122 --> 00:09:42,539
Last seen heading east.

170
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:45,709
I repeat, IeveI four aIert,
EquaIistjaiIbreak.

171
00:09:45,793 --> 00:09:47,752
Chi-blockers! That's them!

172
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:49,170
Let's get 'em!

173
00:10:12,528 --> 00:10:14,738
Korra, Bolin, give me a ramp, now!

174
00:10:41,432 --> 00:10:43,183
Help me out! We gotta make this turn!

175
00:10:49,106 --> 00:10:51,066
They don't know we made the turn.

176
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:52,651
Okay, get ready.

177
00:11:41,659 --> 00:11:43,618
Avatar Korra,
what do you think you're doing?

178
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:46,663
Hey, Tarrlok.
Nice of you to show up finally.

179
00:11:46,747 --> 00:11:49,582
Here, we captured
the escaped convicts for you.

180
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:52,168
What you did was tear up the city

181
00:11:52,253 --> 00:11:54,671
and impede the real authorities
in their pursuit of these criminals.

182
00:11:55,673 --> 00:11:57,090
That's funny,

183
00:11:57,174 --> 00:12:01,219
l didn't see your little task force
or the cops the whole time.

184
00:12:01,303 --> 00:12:04,681
lf it wasn't for Team Avatar,
they would've gotten away.

185
00:12:04,682 --> 00:12:08,685
This is your last warning,
stay out of my way.

186
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:17,527
Republic City stands
as a beacon of freedom.

187
00:12:17,611 --> 00:12:21,197
But the Equalists are using
that freedom to tear it down.

188
00:12:21,532 --> 00:12:23,700
The law l have proposed
would make it illegal

189
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:25,910
for anyone to be a member
of the Equalists

190
00:12:25,995 --> 00:12:28,705
or even be associated with them.

191
00:12:28,706 --> 00:12:30,665
lt also puts into effect a curfew,

192
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:34,294
ensuring all non-benders
are in their own homes by nightfall.

193
00:12:34,378 --> 00:12:36,171
This is going too far, Tarrlok.

194
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:39,257
You can't punish all non-benders
for the actions of a few.

195
00:12:39,341 --> 00:12:44,554
That kind of cowardice will cause
our city to fall into Amon's hands.

196
00:12:44,638 --> 00:12:46,723
We must pass this law.

197
00:12:46,724 --> 00:12:47,724
All in favor?

198
00:13:07,328 --> 00:13:11,623
AII avaiIabIe units, pIease respond to
the 5600 bIock of Dragon FIats Borough.

199
00:13:11,707 --> 00:13:13,208
EquaIists have taken to the streets.

200
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:16,628
Consider them armed and dangerous.
Proceed with caution.

201
00:13:16,754 --> 00:13:17,754
l call front.

202
00:13:18,088 --> 00:13:19,130
After you.

203
00:13:19,215 --> 00:13:20,799
What a gentleman. Thanks.

204
00:13:36,273 --> 00:13:37,774
Why is the power out?

205
00:13:52,581 --> 00:13:55,708
Wait a second, these people
aren't armed or dangerous.

206
00:13:55,793 --> 00:13:57,794
Sure doesn't look that way.

207
00:13:57,962 --> 00:14:01,756
All non-benders,
return to your homes immediateIy!

208
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:04,634
Yeah, as soon as you turn
our power back on!

209
00:14:05,803 --> 00:14:08,513
Disperse or you wiII aII be arrested!

210
00:14:08,597 --> 00:14:10,807
You benders can't treat us this way!

211
00:14:10,808 --> 00:14:13,726
Mommy, look, it's the Avatar.

212
00:14:14,937 --> 00:14:16,437
Please, help us.

213
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:18,022
You're our Avatar, too.

214
00:14:23,821 --> 00:14:25,488
Everyone, please stay calm.

215
00:14:25,573 --> 00:14:27,365
l'm gonna put a stop to this.

216
00:14:35,624 --> 00:14:37,166
Tarrlok,

217
00:14:37,251 --> 00:14:40,128
you need to turn the power back on
and leave these people alone.

218
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:43,590
Avatar Korra, you and your playmates
have no business here.

219
00:14:43,841 --> 00:14:45,383
We're not going anywhere.

220
00:14:45,467 --> 00:14:48,511
You don't have the right to treat
these innocent people like criminals.

221
00:14:48,596 --> 00:14:50,138
This is an Equalist rally.

222
00:14:50,222 --> 00:14:51,848
There is nothing innocent about it.

223
00:14:51,849 --> 00:14:53,600
They're not Equalists.

224
00:14:53,684 --> 00:14:55,852
They're just normal people
who want their rights back.

225
00:14:55,853 --> 00:14:58,021
They are the enemy.

226
00:14:58,105 --> 00:14:59,689
Round up all these Equalists!

227
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:25,340
Stop!

228
00:15:37,853 --> 00:15:39,354
Hey! Let me go!

229
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:40,813
You're under arrest.

230
00:15:40,898 --> 00:15:42,732
What? You can't do that!

231
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:44,525
Actually, l can.

232
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:46,110
She's a non-bender out past curfew,

233
00:15:46,195 --> 00:15:48,279
and her father
is a known Equalist conspirator.

234
00:15:48,364 --> 00:15:49,364
Let her go!

235
00:15:49,907 --> 00:15:51,908
Arrest him and his brother.

236
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:55,578
Tarrlok!

237
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:01,918
Unless you want to join
your friends in prison,

238
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:05,755
l suggest you put those down
and go back to the Air Temple.

239
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:08,758
Korra, listen to him. lt's not worth it.

240
00:16:13,847 --> 00:16:15,056
We'll be all right.

241
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:18,309
Don't worry, l'll call Tenzin.
He can get you out!

242
00:16:26,068 --> 00:16:30,321
So sad to see your little
Team Avatar broken up.

243
00:16:30,406 --> 00:16:31,698
You had a good run.

244
00:16:31,782 --> 00:16:33,616
This isn't over, Tarrlok!

245
00:16:34,743 --> 00:16:36,244
l believe it is.

246
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:37,370
Take them away.

247
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:07,984
-Hey!
-l came as fast as l could.

248
00:17:07,985 --> 00:17:09,068
Are your friends all right?

249
00:17:09,153 --> 00:17:11,988
l don't know, these knuckleheads
won't tell me anything.

250
00:17:11,989 --> 00:17:13,448
l'll take care of this.

251
00:17:17,077 --> 00:17:18,995
Saikhan, a word, please.

252
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:23,374
Councilman Tenzin, l'm pretty swamped
at the moment. Can this wait?

253
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:24,917
No, it cannot.

254
00:17:25,002 --> 00:17:28,004
Three ofAvatar Korra's friends
were wrongly arrested tonight.

255
00:17:28,088 --> 00:17:29,922
l'd like you to release them immediately.

256
00:17:30,007 --> 00:17:31,257
They're not going anywhere.

257
00:17:31,341 --> 00:17:33,760
They were interfering
with police business.

258
00:17:33,844 --> 00:17:37,096
Your so-called police business
was rounding up innocent people

259
00:17:37,181 --> 00:17:39,015
and claiming they were Equalists.

260
00:17:39,099 --> 00:17:40,641
They should be released, too!

261
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:44,228
All Equalist suspects
are being detained indefinitely.

262
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:46,939
They'll be freed if and when
the task force deems

263
00:17:47,024 --> 00:17:48,191
they are no longer a threat.

264
00:17:48,275 --> 00:17:51,027
Those people are entitled
to due process under the law.

265
00:17:51,028 --> 00:17:53,654
You'll have to take that up
with Councilman Tarrlok.

266
00:17:53,864 --> 00:17:57,241
l plan to at the Council meeting,
first thing in the morning.

267
00:17:58,577 --> 00:18:01,287
You're officially
the worst chief of police ever!

268
00:18:01,371 --> 00:18:02,622
Calm down, Korra.

269
00:18:02,706 --> 00:18:06,042
l'll get this sorted out.
We just need to be patient.

270
00:18:08,045 --> 00:18:11,380
But you really are the worst. Ever.

271
00:18:29,399 --> 00:18:32,068
Wake up, Naga. Let's go.

272
00:18:41,703 --> 00:18:43,371
Wait for me here, girl.

273
00:18:43,455 --> 00:18:46,415
Don't worry, l'll be all right.

274
00:18:57,594 --> 00:18:59,220
You and l need to talk.

275
00:19:08,105 --> 00:19:10,106
Are any of the other
Council members here?

276
00:19:10,107 --> 00:19:12,733
l believe everyone has gone home
for the night.

277
00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:14,652
Then you should do the same.

278
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:18,030
Are you sure, sir?

279
00:19:18,115 --> 00:19:19,115
Leave us.

280
00:19:25,122 --> 00:19:27,582
You obviously have
something on your mind.

281
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:28,708
Spit it out.

282
00:19:28,792 --> 00:19:33,171
Don't you see? You're doing exactly
what Amon says is wrong with benders.

283
00:19:33,255 --> 00:19:36,132
You're using your power to oppress
and intimidate people.

284
00:19:36,133 --> 00:19:37,592
And you don't?

285
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:39,886
Of... Of course not!

286
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:42,138
lsn't that what you came here to do?

287
00:19:42,139 --> 00:19:44,682
lntimidate me
into releasing your friends?

288
00:19:46,226 --> 00:19:49,228
See, that's what
l admire about you, Korra,

289
00:19:49,313 --> 00:19:54,066
your willingness to go to extremes
in order to get what you want.

290
00:19:54,151 --> 00:19:55,985
lt is a quality we both share.

291
00:19:56,153 --> 00:19:58,154
You and l are nothing alike.

292
00:19:58,155 --> 00:20:01,157
Look, l'll make you a deal.

293
00:20:01,158 --> 00:20:04,160
You fall in line and do what l say,

294
00:20:04,161 --> 00:20:05,620
and l'll release your friends.

295
00:20:05,704 --> 00:20:08,497
That's why you arrested them?
To get to me?

296
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:10,541
l need your answer.

297
00:20:12,169 --> 00:20:13,336
No.

298
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:16,214
You might be able to manipulate
Chief Saikhan into following you,

299
00:20:16,298 --> 00:20:17,715
but it won't work on me.

300
00:20:19,343 --> 00:20:22,178
You will regret that decision.

301
00:20:22,179 --> 00:20:24,096
You need to be stopped!

302
00:20:24,181 --> 00:20:25,431
You're just as bad as Amon.

303
00:20:27,476 --> 00:20:31,812
l've tried to work with you, Korra,
but you've made it impossible.

304
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,822
Still think l'm a half-baked Avatar?

305
00:21:37,254 --> 00:21:38,754
What are you gonna do now?

306
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:40,798
You're all out of water, pal.

307
00:21:56,481 --> 00:21:58,691
You're in my way, Avatar,

308
00:21:58,775 --> 00:22:00,818
and you need to be removed.

309
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,780
You're a...

310
00:22:04,865 --> 00:22:06,866
You're a Bloodbender?

311
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:08,534
Very observant.

312
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:13,497
lt's not a full moon. How...

313
00:22:13,582 --> 00:22:15,541
How are you doing this?

314
00:22:15,625 --> 00:22:18,586
There are a lot of things
you don't know about me.

315
00:22:39,316 --> 00:22:40,608
Where are you taking me?

316
00:22:40,692 --> 00:22:43,319
Somewhere no one will find you.

317
00:22:43,403 --> 00:22:46,489
Say goodbye to Republic City,
Avatar Korra.

318
00:22:46,573 --> 00:22:48,949
You'll never see it again.

319
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:55,664
You can't do this!

320
00:22:55,749 --> 00:22:57,333
Let me out!

321
00:22:57,709 --> 00:23:00,002
No!
