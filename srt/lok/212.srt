1
00:00:07,547 --> 00:00:09,548
Earth.

2
00:00:09,549 --> 00:00:11,049
Fire.

3
00:00:11,050 --> 00:00:13,051
Air.

4
00:00:13,052 --> 00:00:15,153
Water.

5
00:00:15,154 --> 00:00:18,957
Only the Avatar can master
all four elements

6
00:00:18,958 --> 00:00:21,259
and bring balance to the world.

7
00:00:27,333 --> 00:00:28,700
- Bolin's a hero.

8
00:00:28,701 --> 00:00:31,403
The mover star stopped
Varrick's kidnapping attempt

9
00:00:31,404 --> 00:00:33,472
on President Raiko,
proving his brother's innocence.

10
00:00:33,473 --> 00:00:35,474
Mako and Korra were reunited,

11
00:00:35,475 --> 00:00:37,976
but Korra has no memory
of their breakup.

12
00:00:37,977 --> 00:00:40,812
Meanwhile, Jinora's spirit is
still trapped in the spirit world,

13
00:00:40,813 --> 00:00:43,381
and Tonraq and his Southern forces
have been defeated.

14
00:00:43,382 --> 00:00:44,816
Now it's up to team Avatar

15
00:00:44,817 --> 00:00:48,253
to stop Unalaq
before harmonic convergence.

16
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:29,795
- What's up with the coat?

17
00:01:29,796 --> 00:01:31,563
And where did you get that pie?

18
00:01:31,564 --> 00:01:33,298
- It's a Varrick ship.

19
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:35,133
You never know what you're gonna find.

20
00:01:35,134 --> 00:01:37,269
There's a whole level
filled with funhouse mirrors.

21
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:40,438
Of course,
there's also the cat-gator deck.

22
00:01:41,874 --> 00:01:43,308
I miss that guy.

23
00:01:43,309 --> 00:01:46,244
He really knew how to make
a long trip interesting.

24
00:01:46,245 --> 00:01:48,313
So have you told Korra yet
about how

25
00:01:48,314 --> 00:01:49,681
you guys broke up
and then you

26
00:01:49,682 --> 00:01:51,383
kind of started dating Asami
while she was off

27
00:01:51,384 --> 00:01:53,118
getting attacked by dark spirits?

28
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:54,319
- You wanna keep it down?

29
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,621
I'm waiting for the right moment.

30
00:01:56,622 --> 00:01:58,256
- Oh, Mako.

31
00:01:58,257 --> 00:02:00,759
You know, a wise man once
told me that delivering bad news

32
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:03,328
to a girlfriend was like
ripping off a blood-sucking leech.

33
00:02:03,329 --> 00:02:06,097
You just have to do it fast
and get it over with.

34
00:02:06,098 --> 00:02:08,867
I hate it when you listen to me.

35
00:02:08,868 --> 00:02:10,302
Fine.

36
00:02:10,303 --> 00:02:11,937
- Unalaq will be waiting for you.

37
00:02:11,938 --> 00:02:14,573
You'll need all of
your Avatar power to stop him.

38
00:02:14,574 --> 00:02:16,508
- I'm going to close the spirit portals,

39
00:02:16,509 --> 00:02:19,377
lock Vaatu in for another 10,000 years,

40
00:02:19,378 --> 00:02:24,378
and make Unalaq wish
he'd never been born!

41
00:02:35,094 --> 00:02:36,194
Thanks, Mako.

42
00:02:36,195 --> 00:02:39,297
- Uh... um...

43
00:02:39,298 --> 00:02:40,665
- Did you want something?

44
00:02:40,666 --> 00:02:44,302
- Uh, no, no, nothing.

45
00:02:49,375 --> 00:02:51,543
- As soon as we reach
the Southern Water Tribe,

46
00:02:51,544 --> 00:02:54,079
we'll blast through the blockade
at the main port.

47
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,815
Then we can rendezvous
with Tonraq and his troops,

48
00:02:56,816 --> 00:02:58,884
crash through the defenses
around the portal,

49
00:02:58,885 --> 00:03:00,819
and enter the spirit world.

50
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:03,221
- Whoa, since when
does my little brother

51
00:03:03,222 --> 00:03:05,423
want to crash or blast
through anything?

52
00:03:05,424 --> 00:03:08,360
- I'll do whatever it takes
to save my daughter.

53
00:03:08,361 --> 00:03:10,362
- We all want to save Jinora,

54
00:03:10,363 --> 00:03:13,365
but I think your plan
might be a tad overaggressive,

55
00:03:13,366 --> 00:03:16,268
seeing as there are
only seven of us and one ship.

56
00:03:16,269 --> 00:03:18,403
- Really?
And what do you suggest?

57
00:03:18,404 --> 00:03:21,673
- An attack like this
calls for strategy.

58
00:03:21,674 --> 00:03:24,209
I remember
when I was surrounded by pirates

59
00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:26,077
in the Hurricane Straits.

60
00:03:26,078 --> 00:03:27,879
We managed to capture them all

61
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:31,116
with just a feather, two eggs,
and a barrel of molasses.

62
00:03:31,117 --> 00:03:33,485
- I don't want to hear
any of your crazy stories now.

63
00:03:33,486 --> 00:03:38,256
This is serious.

64
00:03:38,257 --> 00:03:40,458
- Are we almost there?
- Asami: Almost.

65
00:03:40,459 --> 00:03:43,361
But I just picked up a distress signal

66
00:03:43,362 --> 00:03:45,130
from the Southern troops.

67
00:03:45,131 --> 00:03:50,131
There's a problem.

68
00:04:00,279 --> 00:04:03,415
. Mom!

69
00:04:03,416 --> 00:04:05,717
- I'm so happy you're here.

70
00:04:05,718 --> 00:04:08,186
- Where's Dad?

71
00:04:08,187 --> 00:04:10,855
- Unalaq wiped out
the entire Southern resistance

72
00:04:10,856 --> 00:04:13,358
and captured your father.

73
00:04:13,359 --> 00:04:15,527
- I'll get him back.

74
00:04:15,528 --> 00:04:17,228
- Where is my mother?

75
00:04:17,229 --> 00:04:18,863
- She's in the healing hut.

76
00:04:18,864 --> 00:04:23,864
So many injured.

77
00:04:33,045 --> 00:04:34,512
- What happened?

78
00:04:34,513 --> 00:04:37,248
- Her soul is trapped
in the spirit world.

79
00:04:37,249 --> 00:04:40,485
- Oh, my goodness.
How long has she been away?

80
00:04:40,486 --> 00:04:42,153
- Almost a week.

81
00:04:42,154 --> 00:04:43,755
I've tried to keep her energy flowing,

82
00:04:43,756 --> 00:04:45,890
but I can feel her slipping away.

83
00:04:45,891 --> 00:04:50,891
You're the only one
who can help her now, Mom.

84
00:04:57,770 --> 00:04:59,637
- How much longer
can she survive like this?

85
00:04:59,638 --> 00:05:01,639
- I don't know.

86
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:06,640
But she's very strong
to have lasted this long.

87
00:05:07,546 --> 00:05:08,947
- I talked to the rebels.

88
00:05:08,948 --> 00:05:11,182
They said Unalaq's got
the southern portal surrounded.

89
00:05:11,183 --> 00:05:13,651
Harmonic convergence
is only a few hours away.

90
00:05:13,652 --> 00:05:16,054
- Then we have to break through
the enemy lines ourselves

91
00:05:16,055 --> 00:05:17,522
and get to the portal now.

92
00:05:17,523 --> 00:05:19,324
- There's no use in talking anymore.

93
00:05:19,325 --> 00:05:20,892
We know what our mission is.

94
00:05:20,893 --> 00:05:24,529
- A suicide mission.

95
00:05:24,530 --> 00:05:27,065
- You know, I was
in a similar situation once.

96
00:05:27,066 --> 00:05:28,900
My platoon had crawled
through the desert

97
00:05:28,901 --> 00:05:30,468
with no water for a week,

98
00:05:30,469 --> 00:05:34,606
but when we finally located
the only oasis for 100 miles,

99
00:05:34,607 --> 00:05:37,776
it was surrounded
by angry Sandbenders.

100
00:05:37,777 --> 00:05:40,645
I realized our only chance
to get to the water

101
00:05:40,646 --> 00:05:43,248
was to drop in from above.

102
00:05:43,249 --> 00:05:45,216
So I fashioned together a catapult,

103
00:05:45,217 --> 00:05:47,819
and with the help of
a few well-trained hog-monkeys--

104
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:49,988
- Enough of your ridiculous lies.

105
00:05:49,989 --> 00:05:51,856
Can't you see
that the fate of the world

106
00:05:51,857 --> 00:05:56,227
and Jinora's life depends
on what we do here today?

107
00:05:56,228 --> 00:05:58,463
- Hold on.
Maybe Bumi's right.

108
00:05:58,464 --> 00:06:00,165
We don't have a catapult
and hog-monkeys,

109
00:06:00,166 --> 00:06:01,566
but we have a flying bison,

110
00:06:01,567 --> 00:06:03,435
and there's a plane on Varrick's ship.

111
00:06:03,436 --> 00:06:05,403
Maybe we can attack from above.

112
00:06:05,404 --> 00:06:06,504
- What are you thinking?

113
00:06:06,505 --> 00:06:08,406
- Mako, Bolin,
and I can use the plane

114
00:06:08,407 --> 00:06:09,774
to create a distraction

115
00:06:09,775 --> 00:06:11,576
and scatter some of the defenses.

116
00:06:11,577 --> 00:06:13,578
You, Tenzin, Bumi, and Kya can fly

117
00:06:13,579 --> 00:06:17,715
into the spirit portal on Oogi
when you see an opening.

118
00:06:17,716 --> 00:06:22,716
- Let's get moving.

119
00:06:37,903 --> 00:06:40,038
- What are we still doing here, Father?

120
00:06:40,039 --> 00:06:43,007
- The invasion
was completely successful,

121
00:06:43,008 --> 00:06:45,577
and the Southern Tribe
is under our control.

122
00:06:45,578 --> 00:06:47,412
The spirit portals are open.

123
00:06:47,413 --> 00:06:50,915
- You've restored balance.
Now we would like to go home.

124
00:06:50,916 --> 00:06:52,917
- You don't understand.

125
00:06:52,918 --> 00:06:56,254
Everything I've achieved so far
will pale in comparison

126
00:06:56,255 --> 00:06:57,822
with what I'm about to accomplish.

127
00:06:57,823 --> 00:07:00,992
- What else is there?
The Water Tribe is united.

128
00:07:00,993 --> 00:07:03,828
- After today,
there will be no more Water Tribe,

129
00:07:03,829 --> 00:07:05,930
no more nations of any kind.

130
00:07:05,931 --> 00:07:08,299
The world is about to be transformed

131
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:11,169
into something magnificent and new,

132
00:07:11,170 --> 00:07:15,874
and I will lead
this glorious revolution.

133
00:07:15,875 --> 00:07:17,642
Now go outside
and get the troops ready

134
00:07:17,643 --> 00:07:19,010
to defend the spirit portal.

135
00:07:19,011 --> 00:07:22,380
- From whom?
We've already beaten everyone.

136
00:07:22,381 --> 00:07:24,616
- The Avatar will be here soon.

137
00:07:24,617 --> 00:07:29,617
She has no choice.

138
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:42,500
- Are you ready?

139
00:07:42,501 --> 00:07:45,036
- I'm an Earthbender
strapped to the wing of a plane

140
00:07:45,037 --> 00:07:48,473
hundreds of feet in the air, so no.

141
00:07:48,474 --> 00:07:53,474
- Don't worry. There's no way
they'll be expecting this.

142
00:08:01,353 --> 00:08:06,353
- I think they were expecting it.

143
00:08:28,347 --> 00:08:33,347
Asami!

144
00:08:34,119 --> 00:08:39,119
- Get ready.

145
00:08:43,829 --> 00:08:48,829
Fire!

146
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:17,061
- There are spirits everywhere.

147
00:09:17,062 --> 00:09:18,463
I don't see an opening.

148
00:09:18,464 --> 00:09:21,032
- Let's circle around
and see if we can find a way in

149
00:09:21,033 --> 00:09:25,403
from the other side.

150
00:09:25,404 --> 00:09:30,404
Hold on!

151
00:09:43,689 --> 00:09:45,623
The spirits are weighing Oogi down.

152
00:09:45,624 --> 00:09:47,525
We're losing altitude.

153
00:09:47,526 --> 00:09:51,729
- Get off of him,
you sticky, nasty, little blob of goo!

154
00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:52,764
Whoa!

155
00:09:52,765 --> 00:09:56,668
If I go, you're coming with me.

156
00:09:56,669 --> 00:09:58,469
Aah!

157
00:09:58,470 --> 00:10:03,470
- Bumi!

158
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:36,641
- I wish Varrick was filming this.

159
00:10:36,642 --> 00:10:41,642
We could call it
"Nuktuk: Sky Warrior."

160
00:10:55,961 --> 00:11:00,961
- Brace yourselves.

161
00:11:35,234 --> 00:11:39,504
Dad.

162
00:11:39,505 --> 00:11:42,673
- Korra, I'm so sorry.

163
00:11:42,674 --> 00:11:45,143
I failed you.

164
00:11:45,144 --> 00:11:46,677
- Don't give up.

165
00:11:46,678 --> 00:11:48,713
Harmonic convergence isn't here yet.

166
00:11:48,714 --> 00:11:50,982
We still have a chance.

167
00:11:57,589 --> 00:12:00,291
- We tried.

168
00:12:00,292 --> 00:12:03,361
- Congratulations, everyone.

169
00:12:03,362 --> 00:12:04,862
You've all got front-row seats

170
00:12:04,863 --> 00:12:06,864
for the beginning
of the new world order.

171
00:12:06,865 --> 00:12:09,700
- You don't know
what you're doing, Unalaq.

172
00:12:09,701 --> 00:12:11,869
Freeing Vaatu won't make you powerful.

173
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:14,305
It will only make you a traitor
to everything good

174
00:12:14,306 --> 00:12:16,574
that's happened
for the last 10,000 years.

175
00:12:16,575 --> 00:12:19,544
- You think what Avatar Wan
did was good?

176
00:12:19,545 --> 00:12:22,613
Driving almost all the spirits
from this world?

177
00:12:22,614 --> 00:12:26,517
The Avatar hasn't brought
balance, only chaos.

178
00:12:26,518 --> 00:12:28,920
You call yourself the bridge
between the two worlds,

179
00:12:28,921 --> 00:12:31,088
but there shouldn't be a bridge.

180
00:12:31,089 --> 00:12:33,157
We should live together as one.

181
00:12:33,158 --> 00:12:34,592
- Even if Vaatu escapes,

182
00:12:34,593 --> 00:12:37,228
I'll put him right back
in his prison,

183
00:12:37,229 --> 00:12:38,763
just like Wan did.

184
00:12:38,764 --> 00:12:40,932
- It's true that,
when Wan fused with Raava,

185
00:12:40,933 --> 00:12:43,434
he tipped the scales in her favor.

186
00:12:43,435 --> 00:12:46,304
But this time,
I'll be here to level the playing field.

187
00:12:46,305 --> 00:12:48,906
When harmonic convergence comes,

188
00:12:48,907 --> 00:12:51,442
I will fuse with Vaatu.

189
00:12:51,443 --> 00:12:54,512
And together,
we will become the new Avatar.

190
00:12:54,513 --> 00:12:57,281
A Dark Avatar.

191
00:12:57,282 --> 00:12:59,383
Your era is over.

192
00:12:59,384 --> 00:13:02,119
- Think about what you're doing.

193
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:04,889
I know that you've always had
a deep connection

194
00:13:04,890 --> 00:13:09,260
with the spirits,
but you're still a man.

195
00:13:09,261 --> 00:13:11,028
You're still my brother.

196
00:13:11,029 --> 00:13:13,231
You're Eska and Desna's father.

197
00:13:13,232 --> 00:13:15,466
Are you willing
to throw your humanity away

198
00:13:15,467 --> 00:13:17,568
to become a monster?

199
00:13:17,569 --> 00:13:21,038
- I'll be no more of a monster
than your own daughter.

200
00:13:21,039 --> 00:13:22,340
The only difference is that,

201
00:13:22,341 --> 00:13:25,576
while she can barely recognize
her own spiritual power,

202
00:13:25,577 --> 00:13:27,879
I will be in complete alignment
with mine.

203
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:30,047
Vaatu and I will be as one.

204
00:13:30,048 --> 00:13:34,919
No one will be able
to stand against us.

205
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:36,287
Keep them locked up.

206
00:13:36,288 --> 00:13:38,556
After the harmonic convergence,

207
00:13:38,557 --> 00:13:41,158
I will come for Korra.

208
00:13:41,159 --> 00:13:46,159
- Yes, Father.

209
00:13:46,298 --> 00:13:49,500
- I failed in every way.

210
00:13:49,501 --> 00:13:51,335
We've lost Jinora forever.

211
00:13:51,336 --> 00:13:54,839
- There's still a chance.
They didn't get Bumi.

212
00:14:13,892 --> 00:14:16,794
Oh, you want to play some more.

213
00:14:16,795 --> 00:14:19,497
Well, bring it on.

214
00:14:44,222 --> 00:14:46,824
Oh, we're playing dirty, huh?

215
00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:16,253
Hmm, looks like we've got
a music lover here.

216
00:15:25,397 --> 00:15:30,397
Reinforcements!

217
00:15:32,070 --> 00:15:33,304
All right, soldiers.

218
00:15:33,305 --> 00:15:36,173
Looks like it's on us to save the day.

219
00:15:36,174 --> 00:15:41,174
Luckily, I've got a plan.

220
00:15:46,451 --> 00:15:48,619
- Eska, Desna, listen to me.

221
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:51,555
You've got to help us stop Unalaq.

222
00:15:51,556 --> 00:15:52,757
I know he's your father,

223
00:15:52,758 --> 00:15:55,593
but Vaatu has made him
completely crazy.

224
00:15:55,594 --> 00:15:58,029
- We will never turn on our father.

225
00:15:58,030 --> 00:16:00,531
- Please, if you let me out now,

226
00:16:00,532 --> 00:16:03,334
I can still stop him
from destroying everything.

227
00:16:03,335 --> 00:16:05,936
Once he fuses with Vaatu,

228
00:16:05,937 --> 00:16:08,139
no one will be safe.

229
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:13,140
Desna, he won't be
your father anymore.

230
00:16:14,246 --> 00:16:16,747
- You don't know
what you're talking about.

231
00:16:16,748 --> 00:16:19,650
Our father is the wisest man
in the world.

232
00:16:19,651 --> 00:16:22,219
If he says what he is doing is right,

233
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:27,220
I believe him.

234
00:16:36,802 --> 00:16:40,137
- Huh?

235
00:16:40,138 --> 00:16:41,706
- You know, if I wanted
some ball of evil

236
00:16:41,707 --> 00:16:43,240
lurking over my shoulder all the time,

237
00:16:43,241 --> 00:16:48,241
I'd have stayed home
with my mother-in-law.

238
00:16:50,649 --> 00:16:52,149
- All right, spirit army,

239
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:54,618
your general is here.

240
00:16:54,619 --> 00:16:56,587
Follow me!

241
00:17:03,395 --> 00:17:06,497
It's working.

242
00:17:13,305 --> 00:17:18,305
It's not working.

243
00:17:48,273 --> 00:17:53,273
Get me out of here!

244
00:18:19,604 --> 00:18:22,239
Whoo-hoo!

245
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:25,342
- Aah!

246
00:18:25,343 --> 00:18:29,613
- All right, guys.
Rescue time.

247
00:18:38,056 --> 00:18:41,559
- Bumi, how did you manage to
take out this entire encampment

248
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:43,093
on your own?

249
00:18:43,094 --> 00:18:46,063
- I did it all
with my trusty flute and--

250
00:18:46,064 --> 00:18:48,332
oh, never mind.
You wouldn't believe it anyway.

251
00:18:48,333 --> 00:18:53,333
Let's get moving.

252
00:19:03,748 --> 00:19:06,350
- You run into the portal.

253
00:19:06,351 --> 00:19:08,586
I'll try to hold off anyone
who comes after you.

254
00:19:08,587 --> 00:19:12,156
- No, you're too hurt.
You need a healer.

255
00:19:12,157 --> 00:19:15,025
Asami, can you take Oogi
and my dad back to my mom?

256
00:19:15,026 --> 00:19:17,761
- Mm-hmm.
- This is my fight now.

257
00:19:17,762 --> 00:19:20,698
- Korra.

258
00:19:20,699 --> 00:19:21,565
I love you.

259
00:19:21,566 --> 00:19:24,535
- I love you too, Dad.

260
00:19:24,536 --> 00:19:29,536
. Yip-yip-

261
00:19:34,446 --> 00:19:36,580
- Once we're inside, you go find Jinora.

262
00:19:36,581 --> 00:19:38,949
Mako and Bolin will take care of Unalaq

263
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:41,252
while I close the portal,
so Vaatu can't escape.

264
00:19:41,253 --> 00:19:43,454
- Wait a second.
Worst-case scenario.

265
00:19:43,455 --> 00:19:45,556
So we're fighting Unalaq,
you close the portals,

266
00:19:45,557 --> 00:19:48,826
and let's just say
something happens to you.

267
00:19:48,827 --> 00:19:51,996
Are we gonna be trapped
in there for eternity?

268
00:19:51,997 --> 00:19:54,064
- If everything goes as planned,

269
00:19:54,065 --> 00:19:57,835
we'll all walk out together
after harmonic convergence.

270
00:19:57,836 --> 00:20:02,836
If not...

271
00:20:06,044 --> 00:20:11,044
Let's go.

272
00:20:32,537 --> 00:20:35,940
Tenzin, go find Jinora.

273
00:20:35,941 --> 00:20:40,941
- Come on!

274
00:21:28,026 --> 00:21:31,195
- You're running out of time, Raava.

275
00:21:31,196 --> 00:21:36,196
I know you feel it coming.
