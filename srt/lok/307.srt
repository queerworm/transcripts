1
00:00:01,461 --> 00:00:02,629
Tenzin: EARTH.

2
00:00:03,421 --> 00:00:04,839
FIRE.

3
00:00:05,173 --> 00:00:06,216
AIR.

4
00:00:06,841 --> 00:00:08,009
WATER.

5
00:00:09,052 --> 00:00:12,764
ONLY THE AVATAR CAN MASTER
ALL FOUR ELEMENTS

6
00:00:13,097 --> 00:00:15,016
AND BRING BALANCE
TO THE WORLD.

7
00:00:21,064 --> 00:00:23,066
Shirc: THE AIR NATION
IS REBORN!

8
00:00:23,149 --> 00:00:25,652
THANKS TO THE ENERGY SHIFT
DURING HARMONIC CONVERGENCE,

9
00:00:25,735 --> 00:00:28,071
CERTAIN PEOPLE HAVE ACQUIRED
AIRBENDING ABILITIES,

10
00:00:28,154 --> 00:00:30,281
INCLUDING BUMI, KAI, AND OPAL.

11
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:32,742
BUT ALTHOUGH THE NEW RECRUITS
SHOW A LOT OF PROMISE,

12
00:00:32,825 --> 00:00:34,202
THEY STILL HAVE A LOT
TO LEARN.

13
00:00:34,494 --> 00:00:36,704
SO WHILE KORRA REMAINS SAFE
IN ZAOFU,

14
00:00:36,788 --> 00:00:38,414
TENZIN HAS BROUGHT
THE AIRBENDERS

15
00:00:38,498 --> 00:00:40,667
TO THE NORTHERN AIR TEMPLE
TO BEGIN THEIR TRAINING.

16
00:00:46,881 --> 00:00:49,300
HIS PUPILS ONCE AGAIN PLEADED
WITH THEIR MASTER

17
00:00:49,384 --> 00:00:51,719
TO EAT SOMETHING,
BUT HE REFUSED,

18
00:00:51,803 --> 00:00:54,639
JUST LIKE HE HAD EACH DAY
THE ENTIRE SUMMER.

19
00:00:55,223 --> 00:00:57,183
INSTEAD, HE SIMPLY MEDITATED,

20
00:00:57,267 --> 00:00:59,978
GETTING HIS NOURISHMENT
FROM THE UNIVERSE.

21
00:01:00,103 --> 00:01:03,940
SO MONK TANG XU COMPLETED
THE 97TH DAY

22
00:01:04,023 --> 00:01:05,733
OF HIS HISTORIC FAST

23
00:01:05,817 --> 00:01:08,069
ON WHICH ISLAND?

24
00:01:08,236 --> 00:01:09,237
OOH! OOH, OOH!

25
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:11,364
ANYONE BESIDES OTAKU,

26
00:01:11,447 --> 00:01:13,783
WHO ALREADY STUDIED THIS
IN HIS ACOLYTE TRAINING...

27
00:01:13,866 --> 00:01:15,076
OOH, OOH, OOH!

28
00:01:15,159 --> 00:01:16,786
AND IS ANSWERING
EVERY QUESTION?

29
00:01:16,869 --> 00:01:18,663
OOH! OOH! OOH!

30
00:01:19,831 --> 00:01:20,915
WHALETAIL ISLAND!

31
00:01:20,999 --> 00:01:23,835
THAT IS CORRECT. AGAIN.

32
00:01:24,669 --> 00:01:26,087
NOW, ON DAY 98...

33
00:01:29,173 --> 00:01:31,050
GREETINGS, AIR PEOPLE.

34
00:01:31,134 --> 00:01:33,428
I COME SEEKING BORING STORIES
TO TAKE

35
00:01:33,511 --> 00:01:34,971
BACK TO THE SPIRIT WORLD.

36
00:01:58,202 --> 00:01:59,454
- THAT WAS INCREDIBLE!

37
00:01:59,537 --> 00:02:02,040
WHEN DO WE GET TO FLY AROUND
ON OUR OWN BISON LIKE THAT?

38
00:02:02,206 --> 00:02:04,000
ONLY AFTER MANY YEARS
OF PRACTICE

39
00:02:04,083 --> 00:02:05,460
AND INTENSE TRAINING.

40
00:02:07,253 --> 00:02:09,756
BESIDES, WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH
BISON HERE FOR ALL OF YOU.

41
00:02:09,839 --> 00:02:12,508
WHAT ABOUT THOSE?
IT'S A WHOLE HERD OF BISONS.

42
00:02:12,592 --> 00:02:14,969
ACTUALLY, THE PLURAL
OF "BISON" IS "BISON."

43
00:02:15,053 --> 00:02:16,179
WHOA!

44
00:02:16,262 --> 00:02:18,264
- COOL!
- WOW, LOOK AT THAT.

45
00:02:18,723 --> 00:02:19,807
CAN WE RIDE THOSE?

46
00:02:19,891 --> 00:02:21,559
NO, THAT'S A WILD HERD.

47
00:02:21,768 --> 00:02:23,770
IT WOULD TAKE MANY YEARS
TO TAME THEM.

48
00:02:24,437 --> 00:02:26,147
NOW LET'S GET BACK
TO OUR LESSONS.

49
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:27,440
DAD!

50
00:02:27,523 --> 00:02:29,484
WE BROUGHT YOU
MORE AIRBENDERS!

51
00:02:35,198 --> 00:02:36,658
OKAY, EVERYONE IS DISMISSED.

52
00:02:36,741 --> 00:02:38,785
WE'LL JUST
PICK THIS UP...

53
00:02:39,535 --> 00:02:41,371
TOMORROW.

54
00:02:44,999 --> 00:02:46,376
HOW WAS EVERYTHING
IN THE CITY?

55
00:02:46,459 --> 00:02:48,211
WELL, WE HAD A LITTLE SCARE,

56
00:02:48,294 --> 00:02:49,754
BUT EVERYTHING IS OKAY.

57
00:02:49,837 --> 00:02:51,839
ZAHEER INFILTRATED
THE AIR TEMPLE.

58
00:02:51,923 --> 00:02:53,591
WHAT? IS EVERYONE ALL RIGHT?

59
00:02:53,675 --> 00:02:55,134
EVERYONE'S FINE.

60
00:02:55,343 --> 00:02:57,261
I FOUGHT WITH HIM,
BUT HE GOT AWAY.

61
00:02:57,345 --> 00:02:59,681
AND HE STOLE SOME OLD NECKLACE
THAT HAD SOMETHING TO DO

62
00:02:59,764 --> 00:03:02,600
WITH GURU LAK...SCHMEER.

63
00:03:02,934 --> 00:03:04,102
GURU LAGHIMA.

64
00:03:04,185 --> 00:03:05,436
RIGHT.

65
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:08,106
YOU KNOW, I CAN NEVER KEEP
ALL THOSE GURUS STRAIGHT.

66
00:03:08,439 --> 00:03:09,857
THERE WERE, LIKE,
A MILLION OF THEM.

67
00:03:09,941 --> 00:03:12,068
REMEMBER THAT LONG,
BORING STORY ABOUT THE GUY

68
00:03:12,151 --> 00:03:13,277
WHO NEVER ATE?

69
00:03:13,361 --> 00:03:14,987
YES, I REMEMBER.

70
00:03:15,613 --> 00:03:18,282
AVATAR KORRA IS CALLING
ON THE TEMPLE RADIO.

71
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:22,787
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?
WHERE ARE YOU?

72
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:24,664
WITH BEIFONG'S SISTER
IN ZAOFU.

73
00:03:24,747 --> 00:03:26,791
WE'RE TOTALLY SAFE,
UNLESS WE GET CAUGHT

74
00:03:26,874 --> 00:03:28,668
IN ANOTHER FIGHT
BETWEEN SU AND LIN.

75
00:03:28,793 --> 00:03:30,795
LIN WILLINGLY TOOK YOU
TO HER SISTER?

76
00:03:30,962 --> 00:03:32,046
NOT EXACTLY.

77
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:33,840
WE GOT A CALL
ABOUT A NEW AIRBENDER,

78
00:03:33,923 --> 00:03:35,800
AND IT TURNED OUT TO BE
SU'S DAUGHTER, OPAL.

79
00:03:36,134 --> 00:03:37,468
SHE'LL BE HEADED
YOUR WAY SOON.

80
00:03:37,552 --> 00:03:39,053
REALLY? THAT'S WONDERFUL!

81
00:03:39,137 --> 00:03:41,305
SHE IS WONDERFUL

82
00:03:41,389 --> 00:03:43,891
AND PRETTY AND SO SMART!

83
00:03:43,975 --> 00:03:46,227
AND SHE SMELLS LIKE FLOWERS.

84
00:03:47,353 --> 00:03:48,396
SORRY.

85
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:49,814
BOLIN OUT.

86
00:03:50,314 --> 00:03:51,524
HOW'S THE TRAINING GOING?

87
00:03:51,607 --> 00:03:53,067
NOT SO WELL, I'M AFRAID.

88
00:03:53,609 --> 00:03:55,903
NO ONE SEEMS TO BE INTERESTED
IN THE HARD WORK

89
00:03:55,987 --> 00:03:58,406
REQUIRED TO BECOME A PART
OF THE AIR NATION.

90
00:03:58,614 --> 00:04:00,575
YOU NEED TO GIVE
YOURSELF A BREAK.

91
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:02,952
LET JINORA AND THE KIDS
HELP YOU OUT.

92
00:04:03,077 --> 00:04:05,329
AND WHAT ABOUT BUMI?
HE WAS A NAVAL COMMANDER.

93
00:04:05,413 --> 00:04:06,497
MAYBE HE HAS SOME IDEAS

94
00:04:06,581 --> 00:04:07,915
ABOUT HOW TO GET
PEOPLE MOTIVATED.

95
00:04:07,999 --> 00:04:10,334
BUMI?
HE'S MY WORST STUDENT!

96
00:04:10,501 --> 00:04:13,254
YEAH, BUT HE LOVES
TO ORGANIZE PEOPLE.

97
00:04:13,337 --> 00:04:15,256
IF YOU ASK HIM FOR HELP,
YOU CAN TRICK HIM

98
00:04:15,339 --> 00:04:16,924
INTO TAKING
MORE RESPONSIBILITY

99
00:04:17,008 --> 00:04:19,761
BY MAKING HIM THINK
THE WHOLE THING WAS HIS IDEA.

100
00:04:19,844 --> 00:04:21,095
HMM.

101
00:04:21,179 --> 00:04:23,222
THAT ACTUALLY SOUNDS
LIKE A GOOD PLAN.

102
00:04:23,389 --> 00:04:26,559
YOU'RE TURNING INTO
A PRETTY WISE AVATAR AFTER ALL.

103
00:04:26,809 --> 00:04:29,187
CONFLICT RESOLUTION.
IT'S WHAT I DO.

104
00:04:30,938 --> 00:04:32,148
WE SHOULD GO DOWN THERE.

105
00:04:32,231 --> 00:04:33,900
I WANT TO FLY
ONE OF THOSE BISONS.

106
00:04:33,983 --> 00:04:36,152
I DON'T KNOW.
WE MIGHT GET IN TROUBLE.

107
00:04:36,235 --> 00:04:37,945
COME ON, LET'S HAVE SOME FUN.

108
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:40,490
WE'LL BE BACK BEFORE ANYONE
REALIZES WE'RE GONE.

109
00:04:40,573 --> 00:04:42,533
I GUESS IT WILL BE ALL RIGHT.

110
00:04:56,464 --> 00:04:58,132
- LOOK, BABY BISONS.

111
00:04:58,424 --> 00:04:59,926
HOW COME THEY'RE ALL
ON THE GROUND?

112
00:05:00,009 --> 00:05:02,011
AIR BISON CALVES CAN'T FLY
FOR A WEEK OR TWO

113
00:05:02,094 --> 00:05:03,262
AFTER THEY'RE BORN,

114
00:05:03,346 --> 00:05:05,598
SO THE ENTIRE HERD WILL STAY
NEAR THE GROUND IN THE VALLEY.

115
00:05:05,890 --> 00:05:07,141
LET'S GO SEE THE BABIES.

116
00:05:07,225 --> 00:05:09,894
BE CAREFUL.
THE MOTHERS ARE VERY PROTECTIVE.

117
00:05:17,652 --> 00:05:19,445
AW, LOOK HOW CUTE.

118
00:05:19,862 --> 00:05:21,697
KAI, GET OUT OF THERE!

119
00:05:32,625 --> 00:05:34,085
WHOA!

120
00:05:36,754 --> 00:05:38,422
WOW, YOU REALLY SAVED ME
DOWN THERE.

121
00:05:38,506 --> 00:05:39,966
- OH.
- YOU KNOW,

122
00:05:40,049 --> 00:05:41,384
YOU'RE AN
INCREDIBLE AIRBENDER.

123
00:05:41,467 --> 00:05:43,761
WELL, I'VE BEEN TRAINING
FOR A LONG TIME.

124
00:05:43,928 --> 00:05:45,346
THEN WHY DON'T YOU
HAVE TATTOOS

125
00:05:45,429 --> 00:05:46,681
LIKE AN AIRBENDING MASTER?

126
00:05:46,764 --> 00:05:48,766
MY DAD SAYS
I'M NOT A MASTER YET.

127
00:05:49,016 --> 00:05:50,852
YOU CAN DO EVERYTHING
YOUR DAD CAN,

128
00:05:50,935 --> 00:05:53,104
PLUS YOU HAVE
ALL THOSE SPIRIT-Y POWERS.

129
00:05:53,479 --> 00:05:55,982
IF ANYONE'S A MASTER, YOU ARE.

130
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,527
SO WE BRING THE NET DOWN

131
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:02,572
ON THE HEAD PIRATE,
AND HE LOOKS AROUND REAL SAD

132
00:06:02,655 --> 00:06:05,449
AND SAYS, "I KNEW I SHOULD
HAVE FOLLOWED MY DREAMS

133
00:06:05,533 --> 00:06:06,951
"AND BECOME A DENTIST."

134
00:06:08,369 --> 00:06:09,954
HOW COME YOU GREW UP
TO BE SO COOL,

135
00:06:10,037 --> 00:06:12,373
WHILE TENZIN BECAME
SUCH A STICK IN THE MUD?

136
00:06:12,456 --> 00:06:15,626
WELL, I GUESS "COOL"
IS JUST SOMETHING YOU'RE BORN WITH.

137
00:06:15,793 --> 00:06:17,336
BUMI, CAN I TALK TO YOU?

138
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:22,091
LET ME GUESS... YOU WANT
TO CRITICIZE ME FOR SOMETHING.

139
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:23,593
ACTUALLY, I NEED YOUR HELP.

140
00:06:23,718 --> 00:06:25,887
OH, YEAH? WITH WHAT?

141
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:27,305
I DON'T THINK
I'M DOING VERY WELL

142
00:06:27,388 --> 00:06:28,764
WITH THE NEW AIRBENDERS,

143
00:06:28,931 --> 00:06:31,642
AND EVERYONE KNOWS
YOU'RE A NATURAL LEADER.

144
00:06:31,767 --> 00:06:34,145
TRUE, I DID WIN
THE ADMIRAL TUNG

145
00:06:34,228 --> 00:06:37,023
NATURAL LEADERSHIP
AWARD TWICE.

146
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:41,027
WHAT WOULD YOU DO
IF YOU WERE IN CHARGE?

147
00:06:41,277 --> 00:06:43,154
HELP ME BE MORE LIKE YOU.

148
00:06:43,654 --> 00:06:45,323
I'D LOVE TO.

149
00:06:45,823 --> 00:06:47,575
YOU'VE GOTTA USE
MILITARY DISCIPLINE

150
00:06:47,658 --> 00:06:49,243
TO WHIP THESE TROOPS
INTO SHAPE.

151
00:06:49,452 --> 00:06:51,203
THE ONLY WAY TO DEAL
WITH NEW RECRUITS

152
00:06:51,287 --> 00:06:54,498
IS TO BREAK THEM DOWN,
SO YOU CAN BUILD THEM BACK UP.

153
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:56,792
RULE WITH AN IRON FIST.

154
00:06:56,876 --> 00:06:59,253
SHOW THEM WHO THE MASTER IS.

155
00:06:59,545 --> 00:07:00,713
THANKS FOR THE INSIGHT.

156
00:07:00,796 --> 00:07:02,298
MY PLEASURE.

157
00:07:11,182 --> 00:07:13,225
DAWN PATROL! EVERYONE UP!

158
00:07:13,351 --> 00:07:15,436
UGH. WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

159
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:16,979
IT'S BARELY LIGHT OUT.

160
00:07:17,104 --> 00:07:18,606
I'M TAKING YOUR ADVICE.

161
00:07:18,731 --> 00:07:21,025
I'M GOING TO BREAK YOU DOWN
AND BUILD YOU BACK UP.

162
00:07:21,233 --> 00:07:22,860
NOW GET MOVING, RECRUIT!

163
00:07:40,544 --> 00:07:43,297
NOTHING LIKE A 10-MILE HIKE
FIRST THING IN THE MORNING.

164
00:07:43,381 --> 00:07:46,217
DON'T THESE ROBES COME
IN A WARM, BISON FUR VERSION?

165
00:07:46,342 --> 00:07:48,010
NO, OF COURSE NOT!

166
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:50,888
OH!

167
00:07:50,972 --> 00:07:52,390
IF IT WEREN'T SO COLD,

168
00:07:52,473 --> 00:07:54,100
I'D GO RIGHT BACK TO SLEEP.

169
00:07:54,225 --> 00:07:56,644
THEN THIS IS THE PERFECT TIME
TO LEARN MEDITATION

170
00:07:56,727 --> 00:07:58,396
AND PROPER
BREATHING TECHNIQUE.

171
00:07:59,188 --> 00:08:01,107
AIRBENDERS ARE ABLE
TO WARM THEMSELVES

172
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:02,650
WITH ONLY THEIR BREATHING.

173
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:04,777
EVERYONE GET
INTO THE LOTUS POSITION.

174
00:08:05,403 --> 00:08:07,947
AH, THIS IS SO MUCH MORE
REFRESHING THAN SLEEPING.

175
00:08:08,072 --> 00:08:10,908
YOU KNOW, WHEN I SAID
THAT THING ABOUT AN IRON FIST...

176
00:08:11,075 --> 00:08:13,327
HUSH. MEDITATION TIME.

177
00:08:14,286 --> 00:08:15,413
FOCUS.

178
00:08:30,177 --> 00:08:32,138
CAN WE GO BACK TO BED NOW?

179
00:08:32,263 --> 00:08:33,681
NOW THAT WE'RE REFRESHED
AND LOOSE

180
00:08:33,764 --> 00:08:35,057
FROM OUR HIKE AND MEDITATION,

181
00:08:35,141 --> 00:08:37,226
IT'S TIME
FOR A BALANCING EXERCISE.

182
00:08:40,146 --> 00:08:43,107
THE KEY IS TO MAINTAIN YOUR
HEAVEN AND EARTH CONNECTION.

183
00:08:46,277 --> 00:08:47,611
NOW YOU TRY.

184
00:08:47,778 --> 00:08:50,031
BACK ON THE POSTS!

185
00:08:50,114 --> 00:08:51,866
IT'S NOT HARD
IF YOU CONCENTRATE!

186
00:08:53,075 --> 00:08:54,535
- WHOA.
- UGH.

187
00:08:54,618 --> 00:08:56,495
WHOA! UGH!

188
00:08:57,955 --> 00:08:59,457
GET BACK UP!

189
00:08:59,623 --> 00:09:01,625
WHAT'S THE MATTER?
YOU CAN'T HANDLE IT, SOLDIER?

190
00:09:08,174 --> 00:09:10,384
DON'T YOU THINK YOU'RE BEING
A LITTLE HARD ON THEM?

191
00:09:10,843 --> 00:09:12,678
DON'T WORRY. THEY CAN TAKE IT.

192
00:09:13,054 --> 00:09:14,305
YOU'LL SEE.

193
00:09:15,139 --> 00:09:17,391
IGNORE THE LEMURS
DIGGING IN YOUR EARS.

194
00:09:17,475 --> 00:09:18,893
CONCENTRATE ON YOUR BREATHING,

195
00:09:18,976 --> 00:09:20,478
AND YOU WON'T EVEN KNOW
THEY'RE THERE.

196
00:09:20,561 --> 00:09:23,022
WHOA, UH, UGH, OH!

197
00:09:26,609 --> 00:09:28,527
WHEN THE HEAD IS SHAVED,
AN AIRBENDER IS ABLE

198
00:09:28,611 --> 00:09:30,112
TO FEEL THE WIND AROUND HIM.

199
00:09:30,738 --> 00:09:32,907
IT IS BOTH HUMBLING
AND FREEING.

200
00:09:34,867 --> 00:09:36,118
HEY, YOU WANNA SNEAK AWAY

201
00:09:36,202 --> 00:09:37,912
AND GO CHECK
ON THE BABY BISONS?

202
00:09:37,995 --> 00:09:40,664
SHH. YOU SHOULD BE
PAYING ATTENTION.

203
00:09:45,419 --> 00:09:46,754
ALL RIGHT, WHO'S NEXT?

204
00:09:47,004 --> 00:09:48,923
I'M NOT SURE I WANT
TO SHAVE MY HEAD.

205
00:09:49,006 --> 00:09:50,091
THAT'S FINE.

206
00:09:50,174 --> 00:09:52,009
SHAVING YOUR HEAD
IS A PERSONAL CHOICE.

207
00:09:52,093 --> 00:09:53,135
WAIT, WHAT?

208
00:09:53,219 --> 00:09:54,220
ANYONE ELSE?

209
00:09:55,554 --> 00:09:58,099
FINE, THEN WE CAN GET RIGHT
TO OUR NEXT TRAINING EXERCISE...

210
00:09:58,182 --> 00:09:59,225
OBSTACLE COURSE!

211
00:10:03,854 --> 00:10:05,523
YOU'RE PUSHING TOO HARD.

212
00:10:05,606 --> 00:10:07,149
MAYBE WE SHOULD GIVE THEM
A BREAK.

213
00:10:07,233 --> 00:10:09,902
JINORA, I HAVE THIS
UNDER CONTROL.

214
00:10:17,743 --> 00:10:19,245
CONCENTRATE.

215
00:10:19,703 --> 00:10:22,706
REMEMBER, AIRBENDERS MOVE
LIKE THE WIND.

216
00:10:24,667 --> 00:10:25,876
AGH!

217
00:10:30,214 --> 00:10:31,382
UGH!

218
00:10:35,886 --> 00:10:37,930
STAY LIGHT ON YOUR FEET,
AND YOU'LL NEVER FEEL

219
00:10:38,013 --> 00:10:40,099
THE STINGING RASH-CACTUS.

220
00:10:42,643 --> 00:10:44,645
OW!

221
00:10:55,906 --> 00:10:57,741
EVERYONE IS WAITING
FOR YOU, BUMI.

222
00:10:58,075 --> 00:10:59,827
IF YOU DON'T MAKE IT OVER
IN THE NEXT 30 SECONDS,

223
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:01,912
THEY'LL ALL HAVE TO RUN
THROUGH THE COURSE AGAIN.

224
00:11:02,204 --> 00:11:04,165
- YOU CAN DO IT, BUMI!
- COME ON!

225
00:11:07,585 --> 00:11:08,836
AGH!

226
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,427
GET BACK ON
THAT WALL, RECRUIT!

227
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:18,512
YOU'RE LETTING
YOUR FELLOW AIRBENDERS DOWN.

228
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,098
I'M FINISHED!

229
00:11:21,265 --> 00:11:22,850
I NEVER WANTED
TO BE AN AIRBENDER,

230
00:11:22,933 --> 00:11:25,352
AND I'M TOO OLD TO BE
BACK IN BOOT CAMP!

231
00:11:25,895 --> 00:11:27,354
COUNT ME OUT.

232
00:11:27,438 --> 00:11:28,647
FINE, QUIT!

233
00:11:28,772 --> 00:11:31,108
WE DON'T NEED YOUR ATTITUDE
IN THE NEW AIR NATION.

234
00:11:31,275 --> 00:11:32,818
MASTER TENZIN?

235
00:11:32,943 --> 00:11:35,446
WHEN DO WE GET TO GO HOME
AND VISIT OUR FAMILIES?

236
00:11:35,696 --> 00:11:37,698
GO HOME? YOU JUST GOT HERE.

237
00:11:37,781 --> 00:11:39,783
WHEN'S DINNER? I'M STARVING.

238
00:11:39,992 --> 00:11:41,535
CAN I CHANGE
OUT OF MY ROBE NOW?

239
00:11:41,619 --> 00:11:42,912
IT'S ITCHY.

240
00:11:42,995 --> 00:11:45,331
THIS IS JUST AS BAD
AS THE EARTH QUEEN'S PRISON.

241
00:11:45,539 --> 00:11:47,583
I'M TIRED
OF ALL THIS COMPLAINING.

242
00:11:47,833 --> 00:11:49,001
JINORA, TAKE OVER.

243
00:11:49,084 --> 00:11:51,503
DOES THIS MEAN
I'M THE MASTER NOW?

244
00:11:51,587 --> 00:11:54,256
YES. JUST LEAD THEM
THROUGH SOME BASIC EXERCISES.

245
00:11:54,465 --> 00:11:56,342
WELL, SINCE I'M A MASTER,

246
00:11:56,425 --> 00:11:58,219
WHEN DO YOU THINK I CAN GET
MY TATTOOS?

247
00:11:58,427 --> 00:12:00,804
- WHAT BROUGHT THIS ON?
- I WAS JUST TALKING TO KAI,

248
00:12:00,888 --> 00:12:02,556
AND HE WAS ASKING ME, SO...

249
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:04,475
KAI! WHAT DOES HE KNOW
ABOUT WHEN

250
00:12:04,558 --> 00:12:05,643
YOU SHOULD GET TATTOOS?

251
00:12:05,726 --> 00:12:07,561
THE ANSWER IS NO!
YOU'RE JUST A LITTLE GIRL.

252
00:12:07,770 --> 00:12:09,605
I'M NOT A LITTLE GIRL ANYMORE!

253
00:12:09,813 --> 00:12:11,732
I CAN AIRBEND
JUST AS WELL AS YOU.

254
00:12:11,815 --> 00:12:14,151
I KNOW EVERYTHING
ABOUT OUR CULTURE AND HISTORY,

255
00:12:14,235 --> 00:12:16,070
AND I HAVE A STRONGER
CONNECTION WITH THE SPIRITS

256
00:12:16,153 --> 00:12:17,446
THAN YOU EVER WILL.

257
00:12:17,655 --> 00:12:19,448
LEAD YOUR OWN CLASS!

258
00:12:21,158 --> 00:12:22,868
IKKI, MEELO, YOU'RE UP.

259
00:12:23,035 --> 00:12:25,204
JUST LEAD THEM
THROUGH THE BAGUA CIRCLE.

260
00:12:28,499 --> 00:12:31,126
LOOK TO YOUR LEFT!
LOOK TO YOUR RIGHT!

261
00:12:31,377 --> 00:12:34,171
ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE WILL NOT
MAKE IT OUT OF HERE ALIVE.

262
00:12:39,635 --> 00:12:41,095
SORRY IF WHAT I SAID
GOT YOU IN TROUBLE

263
00:12:41,178 --> 00:12:42,263
WITH YOUR DAD.

264
00:12:42,346 --> 00:12:43,806
IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.

265
00:12:44,431 --> 00:12:46,517
HE JUST CAN'T BELIEVE
THAT I'M GROWN UP NOW

266
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,435
AND I DON'T NEED HIM
TELLING ME WHAT TO DO

267
00:12:48,519 --> 00:12:50,396
LIKE ONE OF HIS RECRUITS.

268
00:12:51,355 --> 00:12:53,857
I KNOW SOMETHING
THAT'LL CHEER YOU UP.

269
00:12:59,113 --> 00:13:01,115
WHERE DID ALL THE SPIRITS GO?

270
00:13:01,573 --> 00:13:03,033
WHERE ARE THE BABIES?

271
00:13:03,367 --> 00:13:04,910
AAH!

272
00:13:17,172 --> 00:13:19,508
WHAT ARE THESE KIDS DOING
IN MY CAMP?

273
00:13:19,758 --> 00:13:21,552
WE CAUGHT THEM
SNEAKING AROUND.

274
00:13:21,844 --> 00:13:24,054
WE THOUGHT THEY MIGHT
TELL SOMEONE WE'RE HERE.

275
00:13:24,263 --> 00:13:26,557
THEY'RE THOSE NEW AIRBENDERS.

276
00:13:26,682 --> 00:13:28,809
MUST BE LIVING
UP AT THE TEMPLE.

277
00:13:30,102 --> 00:13:31,812
HURRY UP AND GATHER
THE REST OF THE GANG,

278
00:13:31,895 --> 00:13:33,063
AND LET'S GET OUT OF HERE

279
00:13:33,147 --> 00:13:35,649
BEFORE SOMEONE COMES LOOKING
FOR THESE KIDS.

280
00:13:35,774 --> 00:13:37,776
WE'LL TAKE THEM TO BA SING SE

281
00:13:38,027 --> 00:13:40,404
WITH THE REST
OF THE FRESH MEAT.

282
00:13:45,075 --> 00:13:47,911
TATTOOS. HOW CAN SHE THINK.-

283
00:13:47,995 --> 00:13:49,163
FOCUS.

284
00:13:49,246 --> 00:13:51,206
BREATHE.

285
00:13:51,498 --> 00:13:53,542
BUMI RUINS EVERYTHING.

286
00:13:54,084 --> 00:13:55,878
INHALE.

287
00:13:55,961 --> 00:13:57,504
FOCUS.

288
00:13:58,088 --> 00:14:00,049
TAKING A LITTLE BREAK
FROM TEACHING?

289
00:14:00,549 --> 00:14:02,009
I FAILED.

290
00:14:02,092 --> 00:14:04,345
BUMI QUIT, AND THE REST
OF THE AIRBENDERS

291
00:14:04,428 --> 00:14:05,679
WANT TO GO HOME.

292
00:14:05,763 --> 00:14:07,014
CAN'T THEY SEE THAT I'M TRYING

293
00:14:07,097 --> 00:14:08,891
TO REBUILD AN ENTIRE CULTURE?

294
00:14:09,016 --> 00:14:11,143
YOU KNOW, JUST BECAUSE
THESE PEOPLE CAN AIRBEND,

295
00:14:11,226 --> 00:14:13,812
IT DOESN'T AUTOMATICALLY
MAKE THEM AIR NOMADS.

296
00:14:14,605 --> 00:14:16,065
TELL ME ABOUT IT.

297
00:14:16,148 --> 00:14:18,192
I REMEMBER WHEN I MOVED
OUT OF MY PARENTS' HOUSE

298
00:14:18,275 --> 00:14:19,735
TO BECOME AN AIR ACOLYTE.

299
00:14:19,818 --> 00:14:22,071
THAT FIRST NIGHT,
I WAS SO SCARED AND LONELY,

300
00:14:22,154 --> 00:14:24,031
AND THE BED WAS SO HARD.

301
00:14:24,281 --> 00:14:26,116
IT'S ACTUALLY BETTER
FOR YOUR BACK.

302
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:28,035
SORRY.

303
00:14:28,118 --> 00:14:29,578
THE POINT IS,

304
00:14:29,703 --> 00:14:31,121
I REALLY WANTED TO BE THERE,

305
00:14:31,205 --> 00:14:32,998
BUT IT STILL TOOK TIME
FOR ME TO ADJUST

306
00:14:33,082 --> 00:14:34,792
AND FEEL LIKE I WAS
A PART OF IT ALL.

307
00:14:34,875 --> 00:14:37,294
THESE PEOPLE ARE PROBABLY
FEELING THE SAME WAY.

308
00:14:37,419 --> 00:14:39,463
YOU HAVE TO BE PATIENT.

309
00:14:40,381 --> 00:14:43,092
NOW I KNOW HOW KORRA FEELS
WHEN I'M TALKING TO HER.

310
00:14:45,594 --> 00:14:46,887
THANK YOU, PEMA.

311
00:14:54,728 --> 00:14:57,856
BUMI, I WANT TO APOLOGIZE
FOR LOSING MY PATIENCE.

312
00:14:58,315 --> 00:15:00,192
I'M NOT TALKING TO YOU.

313
00:15:01,777 --> 00:15:03,821
HEY, GET BACK HERE!

314
00:15:07,324 --> 00:15:08,450
WHERE'S JINORA?

315
00:15:08,534 --> 00:15:11,036
I SAW HER FLY OFF
ON HER GLIDER WITH HER BOYFRIEND.

316
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:13,038
WHAT? HER BOYFRIEND?

317
00:15:13,247 --> 00:15:14,706
KAI.

318
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:21,422
HOW CAN YOU STEAL THESE BISON?

319
00:15:21,505 --> 00:15:22,840
THEY'RE ENDANGERED.

320
00:15:22,923 --> 00:15:24,925
THAT'S WHY THEY'RE WORTH
SO MUCH.

321
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:27,010
THE EARTH QUEEN
AND HER FANCY FRIENDS

322
00:15:27,094 --> 00:15:30,431
PAY BIG MONEY FOR BISON STEAKS
AND OTHER WEIRD MEAT.

323
00:15:30,556 --> 00:15:33,350
I EVEN HEARD SHE ATE
HER DAD'S PET BEAR.

324
00:15:33,684 --> 00:15:35,227
YOU'RE DISGUSTING.

325
00:15:38,397 --> 00:15:41,483
HEY, DO THAT SPIRIT BEAMING
THING YOU DID TO FIND ME.

326
00:15:41,733 --> 00:15:43,026
GO TO THE TEMPLE FOR HELP.

327
00:15:43,152 --> 00:15:44,778
I CAN'T.
I'M ALL CRAMPED IN HERE,

328
00:15:44,862 --> 00:15:47,030
AND I NEED QUIET
AND TIME TO FOCUS.

329
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:50,409
BUT MAYBE I CAN SEND
A MESSAGE.

330
00:15:53,454 --> 00:15:56,248
SPIRITS, I NEED YOUR HELP.

331
00:15:59,668 --> 00:16:02,463
GO FIND BUM-JU.
TELL HIM WE'RE IN TROUBLE.

332
00:16:04,965 --> 00:16:06,216
NO, I DON'T THINK

333
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:07,885
I SHOULD APOLOGIZE.

334
00:16:07,968 --> 00:16:10,345
TENZIN JUST WANTS
TO BOSS EVERYBODY AROUND.

335
00:16:10,596 --> 00:16:11,847
I'M TOO OLD FOR THAT.

336
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:15,976
WELL, LET'S FACE IT.

337
00:16:16,059 --> 00:16:18,312
I'M JUST NOT CUT OUT TO BE
AN AIRBENDER.

338
00:16:20,397 --> 00:16:22,274
WELL, THAT'S YOUR OPINION.

339
00:16:34,661 --> 00:16:37,289
WAIT, DID JINORA SEND
THIS SPIRIT?

340
00:16:37,372 --> 00:16:38,540
IS SHE IN TROUBLE?

341
00:16:46,215 --> 00:16:47,466
JINORA'S IN TROUBLE!

342
00:16:47,758 --> 00:16:49,801
- WE HAVE TO GO GET HER.
- HOW DO YOU KNOW?

343
00:16:49,927 --> 00:16:51,345
BUM-JU'S FRIEND TOLD ME.

344
00:16:51,428 --> 00:16:53,514
YOU ARE ABLE TO COMMUNICATE
WITH THE SPIRITS?

345
00:16:53,597 --> 00:16:55,557
MORE OR LESS. I GET THE GIST.
LET'S GO!

346
00:16:55,766 --> 00:16:58,018
SHOULDN'T MASTER TENZIN
BE DEALING WITH THIS?

347
00:16:58,227 --> 00:16:59,520
I DON'T WANT
TO GET INTO TROUBLE.

348
00:16:59,603 --> 00:17:02,272
MASTER TENZIN ISN'T HERE.
IT'S UP TO US.

349
00:17:02,648 --> 00:17:04,608
IKKI AND MEELO,
GRAB SOME BISON.

350
00:17:04,775 --> 00:17:07,361
AIRBENDERS, MOVE OUT!

351
00:17:19,456 --> 00:17:20,791
BISON RUSTLERS.

352
00:17:20,916 --> 00:17:23,085
THEY'VE GOT KAI AND JINORA
LOCKED IN CRATES.

353
00:17:23,168 --> 00:17:24,545
LOOKS LIKE THEY'RE GETTING
READY TO LEAVE.

354
00:17:24,628 --> 00:17:25,796
WE'LL HAVE TO MOVE FAST.

355
00:17:25,879 --> 00:17:27,381
I DON'T KNOW IF I'M READY
TO GET IN A FIGHT

356
00:17:27,464 --> 00:17:29,132
WITH SOME BISON RUSTLERS.

357
00:17:29,341 --> 00:17:30,634
I CAN TELL WITHOUT
THE TELESCOPE

358
00:17:30,717 --> 00:17:32,219
THAT THEY'RE MEAN-LOOKING.

359
00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:35,138
LISTEN, THIS IS WHAT
WE'VE BEEN TRAINING FOR.

360
00:17:35,264 --> 00:17:36,807
WE HAVEN'T BEEN TRAINING
THAT LONG.

361
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:38,600
THAT'S NOT IMPORTANT NOW.

362
00:17:39,101 --> 00:17:41,937
REMEMBER HOW WE PERSEVERED
TOGETHER ON THE OBSTACLE COURSE?

363
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:43,438
YOU ACTUALLY QUIT.

364
00:17:44,481 --> 00:17:46,733
WELL, I'M NOT QUITTING NOW.

365
00:17:47,109 --> 00:17:49,861
I KNOW WE'VE HAD
A TOUGH TIME... ME MORE THAN ANYONE...

366
00:17:50,028 --> 00:17:52,406
BUT WE'RE AIRBENDERS,
AND THERE AREN'T MANY OF US,

367
00:17:52,489 --> 00:17:54,491
SO WE'VE GOT
TO STICK TOGETHER.

368
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:57,411
THEY'VE GOT TWO OF OUR OWN
IN CAGES OUT THERE,

369
00:17:57,494 --> 00:18:00,289
AND WE'RE NOT LEAVING
UNTIL WE BRING THEM HOME.

370
00:18:00,664 --> 00:18:03,208
LEAVE NO AIRBENDER BEHIND!

371
00:18:11,008 --> 00:18:13,844
IN, DOWN, AND...TWIST

372
00:18:18,724 --> 00:18:20,350
FREE THE BISON FIRST.

373
00:18:20,809 --> 00:18:22,060
HEY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING OUT?

374
00:18:35,365 --> 00:18:37,034
OOF! UGH!

375
00:19:05,854 --> 00:19:07,105
OOH!

376
00:19:11,568 --> 00:19:12,653
KAI!

377
00:19:26,541 --> 00:19:27,793
WHAT'S GOING ON DOWN THERE?

378
00:19:29,586 --> 00:19:31,129
KAI, HELP!

379
00:19:31,797 --> 00:19:33,256
I'M COMING, JINORA.

380
00:19:53,068 --> 00:19:54,277
WHAT THE...

381
00:20:13,296 --> 00:20:14,631
YOU GOT ME.

382
00:20:14,798 --> 00:20:16,216
I GIVE UP.

383
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:21,680
YOU THINK
YOU CAN KIDNAP JINORA

384
00:20:21,763 --> 00:20:23,682
AND ALL THESE BABY BISONS?

385
00:20:27,644 --> 00:20:29,896
KAI! THAT'S ENOUGH.

386
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:33,400
AN AIRBENDER NEVER ATTACKS
A DEFENSELESS OPPONENT.

387
00:20:35,193 --> 00:20:37,237
BUT THAT WAS
VERY GOOD TECHNIQUE.

388
00:20:45,036 --> 00:20:46,455
MAYBE YOU BOYS HAVEN'T HEARD,

389
00:20:46,538 --> 00:20:49,416
BUT THERE'S SOME
NEW AIRBENDERS AROUND THESE PARTS.

390
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,128
AND YOU NEVER MESS
WITH AN AIRBENDER'S BISON.

391
00:20:55,046 --> 00:20:56,423
WITHOUT MY SHAVED HEAD,

392
00:20:56,506 --> 00:20:57,966
I NEVER COULD HAVE DODGED
THAT NET.

393
00:20:58,049 --> 00:20:59,760
I REALLY FELT IT COMING AT ME.

394
00:21:00,010 --> 00:21:01,720
YOU GUYS SHOULD TOTALLY
GET SHAVED.

395
00:21:02,554 --> 00:21:03,930
I'M PROUD OF YOU.

396
00:21:04,139 --> 00:21:06,975
YOUR CONNECTION WITH THE
SPIRITS AND NATURAL LEADERSHIP...

397
00:21:07,434 --> 00:21:08,769
YOU REMIND ME OF DAD.

398
00:21:08,852 --> 00:21:11,813
I'M SORRY I'VE BEEN
CAUSING YOU SO MUCH TROUBLE.

399
00:21:12,522 --> 00:21:14,107
I GUESS I WAS JUST SCARED
OF NOT BEING ABLE

400
00:21:14,191 --> 00:21:15,901
TO MEASURE UP AS AN AIRBENDER.

401
00:21:16,526 --> 00:21:18,487
YOU KNOW,
EVEN THOUGH I'M AANG'S SON,

402
00:21:18,904 --> 00:21:22,032
I NEVER REALLY FELT LIKE I WAS
PART OF THE AIR NATION BEFORE.

403
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,534
YOU ARE NOW.

404
00:21:30,415 --> 00:21:31,666
THEY'RE SO FRIENDLY NOW.

405
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:33,919
THE BISON ARE
THE ORIGINAL AIRBENDERS.

406
00:21:34,127 --> 00:21:36,046
THEY RECOGNIZE THEIR OWN KIND.

407
00:21:38,673 --> 00:21:40,467
I'M SORRY FOR RUNNING OFF.

408
00:21:40,550 --> 00:21:42,344
WE'RE JUST LUCKY
NO ONE WAS HURT.

409
00:21:42,677 --> 00:21:44,763
- I KNOW.
- BUT I ALSO REALIZE

410
00:21:44,846 --> 00:21:47,015
THAT PERHAPS I WAS
TOO HARSH WITH YOU.

411
00:21:47,224 --> 00:21:49,643
DOES THAT MEAN I CAN GET
MY AIRBENDER TATTOOS?

412
00:21:49,768 --> 00:21:51,812
IT'S HARD FOR ME TO BELIEVE
THAT MY LITTLE GIRL

413
00:21:51,895 --> 00:21:54,105
HAS GROWN UP ENOUGH
TO HAVE HER TATTOOS.

414
00:21:54,773 --> 00:21:56,566
BUT I PROMISE
I'LL THINK ABOUT IT.

415
00:21:57,067 --> 00:21:58,735
- FAIR ENOUGH?
- YEAH.

416
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:00,862
JINORA, LOOK! THEY'RE FLYING!

417
00:22:09,788 --> 00:22:11,957
I GUESS
EVERYONE IS GROWING UP.
