1
00:00:07,667 --> 00:00:09,000
- EARTH.

2
00:00:09,041 --> 00:00:10,750
FIRE.

3
00:00:10,792 --> 00:00:12,500
AIR.

4
00:00:12,542 --> 00:00:14,709
WATER.

5
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:18,750
ONLY THE AVATAR CAN MASTER
ALL FOUR ELEMENTS

6
00:00:18,792 --> 00:00:21,709
AND BRING BALANCE
TO THE WORLD.

7
00:00:27,417 --> 00:00:28,709
- BOLIN, OPAL, AND LIN
RESCUED THE BEIFONGS

8
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:30,375
AND ZHU LI FROM KUVIRA.

9
00:00:30,417 --> 00:00:31,875
NOW THEY'RE RACING
TO REPUBLIC CITY

10
00:00:31,917 --> 00:00:33,792
TO ALERT EVERYONE ABOUT
THE EARTH EMPIRE'S

11
00:00:33,834 --> 00:00:35,333
IMMINENT ATTACK.
MEANWHILE,

12
00:00:35,375 --> 00:00:37,125
KORRA AND TEAM AVATAR HAVE
BEEN PREPARING FOR

13
00:00:37,166 --> 00:00:38,542
JUST SUCH AN EVENT.

14
00:00:38,583 --> 00:00:40,375
PRINCE WU IS LEADING
AN EVACUATION EFFORT

15
00:00:40,417 --> 00:00:43,333
WHILE ASAMI AND VARRICK ARE
CREATING FLYING MECHA-SUITS.

16
00:00:43,375 --> 00:00:45,458
BUT WITH KUVIRA PLANNING TO
STRIKE IN ONLY TWO WEEKS,

17
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:46,917
WILL THEY BE READY IN TIME?

18
00:00:54,875 --> 00:00:58,041
- TODAY WE STAND ON
THE PRECIPICE OF HISTORY.

19
00:00:58,083 --> 00:01:01,625
FOR THE PAST THREE YEARS,
WE'VE FOUGHT SIDE BY SIDE

20
00:01:01,667 --> 00:01:03,458
TO UNITE THE EARTH EMPIRE

21
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:06,709
AND WE'VE PROVEN THAT NO ONE CAN
STAND IN OUR WAY.

22
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:08,959
NOT EVEN THE AVATAR.

23
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,041
BUT OUR MISSION
IS NOT YET COMPLETE.

24
00:01:12,083 --> 00:01:15,583
THERE IS A GRAVE INJUSTICE THAT
MUST BE CORRECTED.

25
00:01:15,625 --> 00:01:18,208
AS YOU ALL KNOW,
AFTER THE HUNDRED YEAR WAR,

26
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:21,500
AVATAR AANG, ALONG WITH
FIRE LORD ZUKO

27
00:01:21,542 --> 00:01:25,625
STOLE EARTH EMPIRE LAND AND
FORMED THE UNITED REPUBLIC.

28
00:01:25,667 --> 00:01:28,792
THIS LAND BELONGS TO THE PEOPLE
OF THE EARTH EMPIRE

29
00:01:28,834 --> 00:01:31,125
AND IT'S TIME TO TAKE IT BACK.

30
00:01:31,166 --> 00:01:34,333
REPUBLIC CITY WILL BE OURS!

31
00:01:34,375 --> 00:01:37,291
all: ALL HAIL THE GREAT UNITER!

32
00:01:40,375 --> 00:01:41,709
- ARE YOU READY TO SHOW
THE WORLD

33
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:44,083
WHAT A TRUE SUPER POWER
LOOKS LIKE?

34
00:01:44,125 --> 00:01:48,041
- YES. I'M HONORED TO MARCH INTO
THE CITY BY YOUR SIDE.

35
00:01:48,083 --> 00:01:49,834
I LOVE YOU, KUVIRA.

36
00:01:49,875 --> 00:01:52,250
- I NEVER COULD'VE DONE THIS
WITHOUT YOUR HELP.

37
00:01:52,291 --> 00:01:55,000
AFTER WE CLAIM VICTORY,
WE CAN FINALLY GET MARRIED

38
00:01:55,041 --> 00:01:58,041
AND RULE OUR EMPIRE TOGETHER.

39
00:02:02,208 --> 00:02:04,166
- HOW'S THE EVACUATION COMING?
- COULD BE BETTER.

40
00:02:04,208 --> 00:02:07,750
AT THIS POINT WE'VE EVACUATED
ALMOST...18 FAMILIES.

41
00:02:07,792 --> 00:02:11,250
- ONLY 18? THERE ARE MILLIONS
OF PEOPLE IN THIS CITY!

42
00:02:11,291 --> 00:02:12,834
- I SAID IT COULD BE BETTER.

43
00:02:12,875 --> 00:02:14,834
- THE PROBLEM IS IT'S
A VOLUNTARY EVACUATION

44
00:02:14,875 --> 00:02:16,709
AND THERE AREN'T MANY
VOLUNTEERS.

45
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:17,917
THEY JUST DON'T FEEL LIKE
THEY'RE IN ANY

46
00:02:17,959 --> 00:02:19,291
IMMEDIATE DANGER.
[door opens]

47
00:02:19,333 --> 00:02:21,125
- GUYS! GOOD! YOU'RE ALL HERE.

48
00:02:21,166 --> 00:02:22,792
- WHAT'S WITH YOU INTERRUPTING
MY IMPORTANT MEETINGS

49
00:02:22,834 --> 00:02:23,750
ALL THE TIME?

50
00:02:23,792 --> 00:02:24,917
- SU!

51
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:27,291
WHAT ARE YOU--YOU'RE OKAY!

52
00:02:27,333 --> 00:02:29,333
I'M SO SORRY ABOUT ZAOFU.

53
00:02:29,375 --> 00:02:30,625
HOW DID YOU ESCAPE?

54
00:02:30,667 --> 00:02:32,375
- OPAL, BEIFONG, AND I
RESCUED EVERYONE

55
00:02:32,417 --> 00:02:34,125
BUT WE HAD A RUN IN
WITH KUVIRA.

56
00:02:34,166 --> 00:02:36,625
WE SAW HER SUPER SPIRIT WEAPON
UP CLOSE.

57
00:02:36,667 --> 00:02:39,250
LIKE, REALLY CLOSE.
WAY TOO CLOSE.

58
00:02:39,291 --> 00:02:41,208
- IS SHE GOING TO USE IT AGAINST
REPUBLIC CITY?

59
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:44,750
- YES. I FOUND OUT SHE'S GOING
TO ATTACK IN TWO WEEKS.

60
00:02:44,792 --> 00:02:46,291
- OH! AND ZHU LI IS ON
OUR SIDE NOW.

61
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:48,083
ACTUALLY, SHE NEVER REALLY
SWITCHED SIDES.

62
00:02:48,125 --> 00:02:49,750
AND I'M JUST GONNA LET HER
EXPLAIN THE WHOLE THING,

63
00:02:49,792 --> 00:02:51,458
ZHU LI?

64
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:53,166
- I PRETENDED TO BE LOYAL TO
KUVIRA SO I COULD

65
00:02:53,208 --> 00:02:54,792
SABOTAGE HER WEAPON.

66
00:02:54,834 --> 00:02:56,709
IT DIDN'T WORK,
BUT I DID OVERHEAR

67
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:58,125
HER PLANS TO ATTACK.

68
00:02:58,166 --> 00:02:59,709
- I KNEW SHE WOULDN'T STOP
AT ZAOFU.

69
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:01,959
- MY GUESS IS, SHE'S COMING
BY RAIL.

70
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,250
IT'S THE ONLY WAY SHE CAN
TRANSPORT THAT WEAPON.

71
00:03:04,291 --> 00:03:05,750
- THEN WE'LL CUT THE RAIL LINES.

72
00:03:05,792 --> 00:03:07,250
- I AGREE. BUT LET'S GET
AS MANY CITIZENS

73
00:03:07,291 --> 00:03:09,083
EVACUATED BEFORE WE DO.

74
00:03:09,125 --> 00:03:10,083
PUT OUT THE ANNOUNCEMENT.

75
00:03:10,125 --> 00:03:12,125
THE EVACUATION IS NOW MANDATORY.

76
00:03:12,166 --> 00:03:13,291
- WE'RE ON IT.

77
00:03:13,333 --> 00:03:14,792
- DON'T WORRY, MR. PRESIDENT.

78
00:03:14,834 --> 00:03:17,041
I WON'T LET KUVIRA TAKE
OUR CITY.

79
00:03:24,917 --> 00:03:26,875
- WELD HOTTER! TIGHTEN TIGHTER!

80
00:03:26,917 --> 00:03:28,667
THE PRESIDENT SAID WE ONLY HAVE
TWO WEEKS

81
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:30,875
TO GET THESE HUMMINGBIRDS
HUMMING!

82
00:03:30,917 --> 00:03:33,417
[humming]

83
00:03:33,458 --> 00:03:35,041
- VARRICK, GOOD, YOU'RE HERE.

84
00:03:35,083 --> 00:03:36,417
CAN I TALK TO YOU FOR A MINUTE?

85
00:03:36,458 --> 00:03:37,375
- WHAT IS IT? I'M BUSY

86
00:03:37,417 --> 00:03:39,083
INSPIRING MY WORKERS.

87
00:03:39,125 --> 00:03:40,333
- WELL, I WENT TO ZAOFU

88
00:03:40,375 --> 00:03:41,583
AND SAVED SU AND HER FAMILY...

89
00:03:41,625 --> 00:03:46,917
AND GUESS WHO ELSE WE FOUND...
HA!

90
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:48,291
- ZHU LI.

91
00:03:48,333 --> 00:03:49,750
- NOW, ISN'T THERE SOMETHING

92
00:03:49,792 --> 00:03:51,834
YOU WANTED TO SAY TO HER?

93
00:03:51,875 --> 00:03:53,041
HMM?

94
00:03:53,083 --> 00:03:54,709
- PLEASE, LET ME GO FIRST.

95
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:57,125
I KNOW I SAID A LOT OF TERRIBLE
THINGS ABOUT YOU

96
00:03:57,166 --> 00:03:58,709
IN FRONT OF KUVIRA,

97
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:02,041
BUT I NEED YOU TO KNOW,
I DIDN'T MEAN ONE WORD.

98
00:04:02,083 --> 00:04:04,959
WHEN YOU WERE BEING TAKEN AWAY,
I THOUGHT MY ONLY CHANCE

99
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,917
TO SAVE YOU WAS TO JOIN HER.

100
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:10,125
BUT EVERYDAY I HOPED FOR THE
CHANCE TO SEE YOU AGAIN

101
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:12,333
AND TELL YOU THE TRUTH.

102
00:04:12,375 --> 00:04:15,583
VARRICK, YOU MEAN THE WORLD
TO ME,

103
00:04:15,625 --> 00:04:18,458
AND I'M SORRY IF I HURT YOU
IN ANY WAY.

104
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:22,208
- DON'T BE SO HARD ON YOURSELF.

105
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:23,959
APOLOGY ACCEPTED!

106
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,834
NOW BE A GOOD ASSISTANT AND
MAN THE ASSEMBLY LINE!

107
00:04:26,875 --> 00:04:29,834
- NO! I AM NOT YOUR ASSISTANT
ANYMORE!

108
00:04:29,875 --> 00:04:31,250
IF YOU WANT ME AROUND,

109
00:04:31,291 --> 00:04:34,291
YOU NEED TO START TREATING ME
LIKE AN EQUAL.

110
00:04:38,917 --> 00:04:41,333
- [sound of indifference]
- [frustrated smack to head]

111
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:45,542
- WE'RE PATCHED IN ON
THE EMERGENCY BROADCAST LINE.

112
00:04:45,583 --> 00:04:47,667
YOU'RE GOING OUT TO EVERY RADIO
IN THE CITY.

113
00:04:47,709 --> 00:04:49,959
- ATTENTION CITIZENS
OF REPUBLIC CITY,

114
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,500
THIS IS NOT A TEST.

115
00:04:51,542 --> 00:04:53,208
AN ATTACK ON OUR CITY IS
IMMINENT.

116
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:56,166
PRESIDENT RAIKO HAS ORDERED
A MANDATORY EVACUATION

117
00:04:56,208 --> 00:04:57,709
FOR ALL CITIZENS.

118
00:04:57,750 --> 00:04:59,500
PLEASE FIND
YOUR EVACUATION HANDBOOKS

119
00:04:59,542 --> 00:05:02,125
AND TURN TO SUB-SECTION
ONE DASH TWO SIX.

120
00:05:02,166 --> 00:05:04,917
THERE YOU WILL FIND INITIAL
INSTRUCTIONS FOR YOUR AREA.

121
00:05:04,959 --> 00:05:07,667
FOR EXAMPLE, IF YOU LIVE IN
NORTHWEST-VECTOR-ONE

122
00:05:07,709 --> 00:05:09,959
REPORT TO YOUR PRIMARY MEETING
LOCATION

123
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,750
WHICH WOULD BE AT
THE EASTERN ENTRANCE

124
00:05:11,792 --> 00:05:14,083
OF THE SOUTHERN WATER TRIBE
LIBRARY.

125
00:05:14,125 --> 00:05:16,834
THERE, YOU WILL CHOOSE A LEADER
AS SPECIFIED IN

126
00:05:16,875 --> 00:05:18,959
SECTION ONE DASH TWO EIGHT.
[phones ringing like crazy]

127
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,041
- UH, CHIEF, WE'RE GETTING
CONFUSED CALLS

128
00:05:21,083 --> 00:05:24,375
FROM ALL OVER THE CITY. I THINK
MAKO'S STARTING A PANIC.

129
00:05:24,417 --> 00:05:27,542
- WHAT'S CONFUSING? I'M GIVING
VERY SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS.

130
00:05:27,583 --> 00:05:29,792
- GREAT, THIS IS JUST WHAT
WE NEED.

131
00:05:29,834 --> 00:05:32,375
- I GOT THIS.

132
00:05:32,417 --> 00:05:35,041
HELLO, EVERYONE.
THIS IS PRINCE WU.

133
00:05:35,083 --> 00:05:37,166
NOW I KNOW YOU'RE ALL
A LITTLE SCARED.

134
00:05:37,208 --> 00:05:40,041
BELIEVE ME, I KNOW WHAT IT'S
LIKE TO BE AFRAID.

135
00:05:40,083 --> 00:05:42,667
I USED TO NOT BE ABLE TO GO TO
THE BATHROOM BY MYSELF.

136
00:05:42,709 --> 00:05:45,125
BUT IF WE LET THAT FEAR
CONTROL US,

137
00:05:45,166 --> 00:05:48,000
NONE OF US WILL EVER BE ABLE TO
GO TO THE BATHROOM,

138
00:05:48,041 --> 00:05:50,041
AND THEN WE ALL LOSE.

139
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:53,750
BUT THE PEOPLE OF REPUBLIC CITY
AREN'T LOSERS, WE'RE WINNERS!

140
00:05:53,792 --> 00:05:56,250
WINNERS THAT ARE GOING TO GET
OUT OF THIS CITY

141
00:05:56,291 --> 00:05:58,417
IN A CALM AND ORDERLY FASHION.

142
00:05:58,458 --> 00:06:00,333
SO I WANT YOU TO GRAB
YOUR FAMILY,

143
00:06:00,375 --> 00:06:01,458
GRAB YOUR NEIGHBOR,

144
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:02,500
GRAB THAT GUY DOWN THE STREET

145
00:06:02,542 --> 00:06:03,792
YOU DON'T KNOW VERY WELL

146
00:06:03,834 --> 00:06:05,834
AND HEAD TO THE NEAREST
BUS, TRAIN,

147
00:06:05,875 --> 00:06:07,166
OR FERRY STATION.

148
00:06:07,208 --> 00:06:09,083
WE'RE GOING TO GET YOU
OUT OF HERE,

149
00:06:09,125 --> 00:06:11,792
SAFE AND SOUND.

150
00:06:17,333 --> 00:06:18,750
- GOOD JOB, KID.

151
00:06:18,792 --> 00:06:23,542
YOU MIGHT NOT MAKE SUCH A BAD
KING AFTER ALL.

152
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:25,250
- ROHAN'S WITH THE ACOLYTES.

153
00:06:25,291 --> 00:06:26,875
THEY HAVE THE BOAT
READY TO LEAVE.

154
00:06:26,917 --> 00:06:28,625
WHY AREN'T YOU ALL PACKED YET?

155
00:06:28,667 --> 00:06:30,083
- THE KIDS AND I HAVE
BEEN TALKING

156
00:06:30,125 --> 00:06:31,875
AND WE DECIDED WE WANNA STAY.

157
00:06:31,917 --> 00:06:34,083
THIS IS OUR CITY,
AND IT'S GOING TO NEED

158
00:06:34,125 --> 00:06:35,709
ALL THE HELP IT CAN GET.

159
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:39,291
- YEAH! ONLY A COWARD
FLEES HIS FATE.

160
00:06:39,333 --> 00:06:42,333
- THANK YOU.

161
00:06:42,375 --> 00:06:45,542
I'M SURE PRINCE WU COULD USE
YOUR HELP WITH THE EVACUATION.

162
00:06:45,583 --> 00:06:47,166
AND YOU THREE CAN HELP
THE OTHER AIRBENDERS

163
00:06:47,208 --> 00:06:49,875
KEEP AN EYE ON THE EARTH EMPIRE
TROOPS FROM ABOVE.

164
00:06:49,917 --> 00:06:54,542
- KUVIRA WILL RUE THE DAY SHE
MESSED WITH MEELO!

165
00:07:36,333 --> 00:07:39,000
- I STILL DON'T LIKE HAVING TO
ABANDON MY OFFICE AND THE CITY.

166
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:41,375
- AIR TEMPLE ISLAND IS
THE IDEAL LOCATION

167
00:07:41,417 --> 00:07:42,667
FOR YOUR BASE OF OPERATIONS.

168
00:07:42,709 --> 00:07:44,333
AND YOU'LL BE SAFE HERE.

169
00:07:44,375 --> 00:07:45,917
- THERE'S SOMETHING WE NEED TO
DISCUSS WITH YOU.

170
00:07:45,959 --> 00:07:47,291
- WHAT IS IT?
- THE FOUR OF US

171
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:48,875
HAVE BEEN TALKING AND...

172
00:07:48,917 --> 00:07:50,709
WE WANT TO TAKE OUT
KUVIRA'S SPIRIT WEAPON

173
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:52,875
BEFORE IT GETS TOO CLOSE TO
THE CITY.

174
00:07:52,917 --> 00:07:55,250
- THAT SOUNDS LIKE A RISK WE
DON'T NEED TO TAKE.

175
00:07:55,291 --> 00:07:56,834
THE EVACUATION IS ON SCHEDULE

176
00:07:56,875 --> 00:07:59,166
AND GENERAL IROH IS GETTING
HIS ARMY IN PLACE.

177
00:07:59,208 --> 00:08:02,250
- I KNOW IROH CAN GO TOE TO TOE
WITH KUVIRA'S ARMY,

178
00:08:02,291 --> 00:08:04,250
BUT THAT WEAPON--
- IT'S TOO POWERFUL!

179
00:08:04,291 --> 00:08:05,917
IT CAN DESTROY THE CITY!

180
00:08:05,959 --> 00:08:07,417
- WE CAN'T LET IT GET TO
OUR DOORSTEP.

181
00:08:07,458 --> 00:08:10,000
- WE'LL SNEAK BEHIND ENEMY LINES
AND DISABLE THE WEAPON.

182
00:08:10,041 --> 00:08:12,417
- IF IT WORKS, IT'LL EVEN
THE PLAYING FIELD.

183
00:08:12,458 --> 00:08:13,458
- BUT IF YOU GET CAUGHT...

184
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:14,959
- IT'S WORTH THE RISK.

185
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,583
- I AGREE, AND IT MIGHT BE
OUR ONLY SHOT

186
00:08:17,625 --> 00:08:20,000
AT PREVENTING AN ALL OUT WAR.

187
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:23,000
GOOD LUCK.
- WE'LL HEAD OUT TONIGHT.

188
00:08:31,458 --> 00:08:36,250
- THERE'S SOMETHING OUT THERE.

189
00:08:36,291 --> 00:08:39,041
IT'S KUVIRA'S ARMY!
THEY'RE A WEEK EARLY!

190
00:08:39,083 --> 00:08:42,333
GET THE COMMANDER IMMEDIATELY,
AND RADIO REPUBLIC CITY!

191
00:08:42,375 --> 00:08:44,834
[thunderous thud]
- [gasp]

192
00:08:44,875 --> 00:08:46,625
[thud]

193
00:08:46,667 --> 00:08:49,041
[mechanized whirring]

194
00:08:56,041 --> 00:08:57,959
[bass tone]

195
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:05,083
[mechanized whirring]

196
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:15,583
- [gasps] GUYS, I SEE SOMETHING.
DOWN THERE!

197
00:09:19,375 --> 00:09:21,375
- IS THAT?
- KUVIRA.

198
00:09:21,417 --> 00:09:23,542
SHE'S ALREADY CROSSED INTO
UNITED REPUBLIC TERRITORY.

199
00:09:23,583 --> 00:09:25,041
SHE'S A WEEK EARLY.

200
00:09:25,083 --> 00:09:26,959
- THIS DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.

201
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,583
THERE AREN'T ANY TRAIN TRACKS
THIS WAY.

202
00:09:28,625 --> 00:09:32,542
HOW ARE THEY TRANSPORTING THAT
SUPER WEAPON OF THEIRS?

203
00:09:40,208 --> 00:09:43,375
- APPARENTLY ON A GIANT
MECHA-SUIT.

204
00:09:49,041 --> 00:09:51,667
- DID YOU KNOW KUVIRA WAS
BUILDING THAT THING?

205
00:09:51,709 --> 00:09:52,875
- OH, DID I FORGET
TO MENTION IT?

206
00:09:52,917 --> 00:09:56,041
NO! OF COURSE I DIDN'T KNOW!

207
00:09:56,083 --> 00:09:58,333
- THERE'S A FLYING BISON
UP AHEAD.

208
00:09:58,375 --> 00:10:00,542
- THE AVATAR...

209
00:10:16,333 --> 00:10:17,542
- I KNOW WHAT HAPPENS NEXT!

210
00:10:17,583 --> 00:10:19,166
WE GOTTA GET OUTTA HERE NOW!

211
00:10:19,208 --> 00:10:25,000
NOW!

212
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:28,500
[all screaming]

213
00:10:42,583 --> 00:10:43,959
- SHOULD WE GO AFTER THEM?

214
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,959
THEY'RE GOING TO WARN
REPUBLIC CITY.

215
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:46,792
- LET THEM.

216
00:10:46,834 --> 00:10:49,750
NO ONE CAN STOP US.

217
00:10:57,959 --> 00:10:59,542
- KORRA, ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

218
00:10:59,583 --> 00:11:00,959
WHY ARE YOU BACK SO SOON?

219
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,083
- IT'S KUVIRA.
OUR INTEL WAS WRONG.

220
00:11:03,125 --> 00:11:05,458
SHE MUST'VE KNOW ZHU LI HAD
THE INFORMATION.

221
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:06,917
- WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO SAY?

222
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:08,917
- KUVIRA'S ARMY IS ONLY
A FEW HOURS AWAY.

223
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:10,834
- NO, THEY CAN'T BE...
WE'RE NOT READY.

224
00:11:10,875 --> 00:11:12,125
- AND THAT SPIRIT WEAPON OF HERS

225
00:11:12,166 --> 00:11:14,041
IS ATTACHED TO A GIANT
MECHA-SUIT.

226
00:11:14,083 --> 00:11:16,208
IT'S OVER 25 STORIES TALL.

227
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:17,792
- GET GENERAL IROH ON THE LINE
AND TELL HIM

228
00:11:17,834 --> 00:11:19,417
THE ATTACK IS HAPPENING TODAY.

229
00:11:19,458 --> 00:11:20,875
WE NEED TO LOCK DOWN THIS CITY.

230
00:11:20,917 --> 00:11:22,667
- PEMA, FIND WU AND GET
THE REMAINING CITIZENS

231
00:11:22,709 --> 00:11:24,208
TO SAFETY IMMEDIATELY.

232
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:26,000
WE CAN'T HAVE INNOCENT LIVES
IN JEOPARDY.

233
00:11:26,041 --> 00:11:28,208
- WHAT SHOULD WE DO?
- LET'S GO TO MY FACTORY.

234
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:30,125
MAYBE WE CAN GET A FEW OF THOSE
HUMMINGBIRD SUITS

235
00:11:30,166 --> 00:11:31,417
UP AND RUNNING.

236
00:11:31,458 --> 00:11:33,083
- WE'RE COMING WITH YOU.

237
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:36,041
- I'LL HEAD TO THE FRONT LINES
AND HELP GENERAL IROH.

238
00:12:44,709 --> 00:12:46,583
- KUVIRA THIS IS
PRESIDENT RAIKO.

239
00:12:46,625 --> 00:12:48,583
I ORDER YOU TO STAND DOWN.

240
00:12:48,625 --> 00:12:50,834
TURN YOU ARMY AROUND AND LEAVE.

241
00:12:50,875 --> 00:12:53,333
- YOU'RE IN NO POSITION
TO GIVE ORDERS.

242
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:55,208
- STAND DOWN OR WE WILL ATTACK.

243
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:58,250
- I DON'T THINK YOU UNDERSTAND
THE POWER I POSSESS.

244
00:12:58,291 --> 00:13:01,291
LET ME MAKE IT CLEAR.

245
00:13:24,333 --> 00:13:27,458
- THIS IS EXACTLY WHY I DIDN'T
WANT TO BUILD THAT WEAPON!

246
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:49,917
- MR. PRESIDENT, DO I HAVE
YOUR ORDER TO ENGAGE?

247
00:13:49,959 --> 00:13:54,792
- YOU HAVE THREE SECONDS OR I
WIPE OUT YOUR ARMY.

248
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:56,291
- I HAVE NO CHOICE.

249
00:13:56,333 --> 00:13:57,792
- TIME'S UP.

250
00:13:57,834 --> 00:14:00,166
- STOP. WE SURRENDER.

251
00:14:00,208 --> 00:14:03,375
REPUBLIC CITY IS YOURS.

252
00:14:03,417 --> 00:14:06,375
- GOOD. TURN YOUR ARMY AND
THE AVATAR

253
00:14:06,417 --> 00:14:09,250
OVER TO ME AND GIVE BAATAR
YOUR LOCATION.

254
00:14:09,291 --> 00:14:12,125
HE'LL PRESENT YOU WITH
OUR TERMS.

255
00:14:12,166 --> 00:14:13,625
- I'M NOT SURRENDERING!

256
00:14:13,667 --> 00:14:16,041
- GET BACK TO THE CITY BEFORE
SHE SEES YOU.

257
00:14:16,083 --> 00:14:19,333
AND KORRA, FIND A WAY TO BEAT
THAT THING.

258
00:14:19,375 --> 00:14:23,291
- I WILL.

259
00:14:23,333 --> 00:14:24,750
- WE'VE DONE IT KUVIRA.

260
00:14:24,792 --> 00:14:26,458
AND I JUST GOT WORD THAT
PRESIDENT RAIKO

261
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:29,417
IS ON AIR TEMPLE ISLAND.
I'M HEADING THERE NOW.

262
00:14:33,667 --> 00:14:35,375
- RAIKO SURRENDERED.

263
00:14:35,417 --> 00:14:36,583
IT'S DOWN TO US NOW.

264
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:37,667
- HOW ARE WE SUPPOSED TO FIGHT

265
00:14:37,709 --> 00:14:38,500
AN ENTIRE ARMY,

266
00:14:38,542 --> 00:14:39,583
A MECHA-GIANT,

267
00:14:39,625 --> 00:14:40,834
AND THAT CRAZY WEAPON?

268
00:14:40,875 --> 00:14:42,083
- WE CAN'T FIGHT IT,

269
00:14:42,125 --> 00:14:44,083
BUT MAYBE WE CAN CRIPPLE IT.
ZHU LI,

270
00:14:44,125 --> 00:14:46,375
WHEN YOU WERE SPYING ON KUVIRA,
DID YOU LEARN ANYTHING ABOUT

271
00:14:46,417 --> 00:14:47,875
THAT METAL MONSTER.

272
00:14:47,917 --> 00:14:49,667
- I HAD NO IDEA THEY WERE EVEN
BUILDING IT.

273
00:14:49,709 --> 00:14:53,083
- GUESS BAATAR JR. IS A BETTER
INVENTOR THAN I THOUGHT.

274
00:14:53,125 --> 00:14:55,375
DON'T TELL HIM I SAID THAT.

275
00:14:55,417 --> 00:14:56,834
- [gasp] THAT'S IT!

276
00:14:56,875 --> 00:14:58,166
BAATAR JR. BUILT IT--

277
00:14:58,208 --> 00:14:59,875
HE'LL KNOW HOW TO TAKE IT DOWN.

278
00:14:59,917 --> 00:15:02,458
I SAY WE CAPTURE HIM AND
GET HIM TO TALK.

279
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:04,709
- HMM...

280
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:07,417
- I KNOW IT'S A LONG SHOT, BUT
IT'S THE ONLY CHANCE WE HAVE

281
00:15:07,458 --> 00:15:10,250
AND IF WE DON'T--
- KORRA. I'M IN.

282
00:15:10,291 --> 00:15:12,375
- WE'LL NEED A STEALTH TEAM OF
AIRBENDERS TO GET IN AND OUT

283
00:15:12,417 --> 00:15:14,125
OF BAATAR'S AIRSHIP UNNOTICED.

284
00:15:14,166 --> 00:15:15,667
TENZIN, BUMI, JINORA, KAI--

285
00:15:15,709 --> 00:15:18,917
LET'S GET MOVING.

286
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:20,458
- WHAT ABOUT ME?

287
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:22,542
- SORRY BUDDY,
BUT THIS MISSION COUNTS ON

288
00:15:22,583 --> 00:15:24,875
EVERYONE BEING AS SILENT
AS POSSIBLE.

289
00:15:24,917 --> 00:15:27,375
AND YOUR FARTS ARE JUST
TOO MUCH OF A WILD CARD.

290
00:15:27,417 --> 00:15:31,250
- I CAN BE QUIET!
[farts]

291
00:15:31,291 --> 00:15:33,917
OKAY. POINT TAKEN.

292
00:15:40,834 --> 00:15:43,000
- IS EVERYONE READY?

293
00:16:30,583 --> 00:16:34,875
[muffled struggling sounds]

294
00:16:51,625 --> 00:16:54,000
- YOU'VE MADE
A TERRIBLE MISTAKE.

295
00:16:54,041 --> 00:16:56,875
ONCE KUVIRA FINDS OUT I'M
MISSING, YOU'RE ALL DONE FOR.

296
00:16:56,917 --> 00:16:58,667
- THAT'S WHY BEFORE
SHE FINDS OUT,

297
00:16:58,709 --> 00:17:01,125
YOU'RE GOING TO TELL US HOW TO
STOP THAT MECHA-GIANT,

298
00:17:01,166 --> 00:17:02,125
OR ELSE...

299
00:17:02,166 --> 00:17:04,083
- OR ELSE WHAT?

300
00:17:08,792 --> 00:17:10,667
YOU WON'T HURT ME.

301
00:17:10,709 --> 00:17:16,583
I KNOW AN EMPTY THREAT WHEN
I SEE ONE.

302
00:17:16,625 --> 00:17:19,417
- [frustrated groan]

303
00:17:19,458 --> 00:17:22,917
- WAS THIS YOU BEST IDEA?

304
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:27,166
YOU'VE LOST, ONLY YOU HAVEN'T
ACCEPTED IT YET.

305
00:17:27,208 --> 00:17:30,375
- LET ME TALK TO HIM.

306
00:17:59,542 --> 00:18:00,875
- ARE YOU SURE?
- CHECK THE ENGINE ROOM.

307
00:18:00,917 --> 00:18:01,834
- WHAT'S GOING ON?

308
00:18:01,875 --> 00:18:02,875
IS EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT?

309
00:18:02,917 --> 00:18:04,333
- JUST A MINUTE, SIR.

310
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:06,000
I'M TELLING YOU, I LOOKED
EVERYWHERE.

311
00:18:06,041 --> 00:18:07,583
- ALL RIGHT, ENOUGH WHISPERING.

312
00:18:07,625 --> 00:18:09,583
- I'M READY TO DISCUSS THE TERMS
OF THE SURRENDER

313
00:18:09,625 --> 00:18:10,917
WITH BAATAR JR.

314
00:18:10,959 --> 00:18:12,959
WHERE IS HE?
- UH...

315
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,917
I'M NOT REALLY SURE.

316
00:18:17,875 --> 00:18:19,583
- BAATAR...
- IF YOU THINK I'M GOING

317
00:18:19,625 --> 00:18:22,375
TO SPILL ALL MY SECRETS TO YOU,
MOTHER,

318
00:18:22,417 --> 00:18:23,834
YOU'RE SADLY MISTAKEN.

319
00:18:23,875 --> 00:18:25,709
- WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS?

320
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:27,875
I KNOW YOU SET OUT TO HELP
BETTER THE WORLD

321
00:18:27,917 --> 00:18:29,625
BUT THIS IS MADNESS!

322
00:18:29,667 --> 00:18:31,709
- IT'S MADNESS TO LET OTHERS
TAKE WHAT'S YOURS

323
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:33,542
AND ACCEPT IT BLINDLY.

324
00:18:33,583 --> 00:18:36,333
THE UNITED REPUBLIC
BELONGS TO US.

325
00:18:36,375 --> 00:18:38,000
AND WE'RE TAKING IT BACK.

326
00:18:38,041 --> 00:18:39,834
- BUT AT WHAT COST?

327
00:18:39,875 --> 00:18:41,417
HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE TO LOSE
THEIR LIVES

328
00:18:41,458 --> 00:18:43,500
BEFORE KUVIRA IS SATISFIED?

329
00:18:43,542 --> 00:18:45,458
- IT DOESN'T HAVE TO COST
ANY LIVES

330
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:47,625
IF YOU WOULD ALL JUST SURRENDER.

331
00:18:47,667 --> 00:18:52,917
ALL THAT KUVIRA AND I WANT IS
A UNITED EARTH EMPIRE.

332
00:18:52,959 --> 00:18:55,625
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT I DID
TO HURT YOU,

333
00:18:55,667 --> 00:18:58,709
BUT WHATEVER IT WAS,
I'M SORRY.

334
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:01,709
WHEN YOU LEFT ZAOFU,
IT BROKE MY HEART.

335
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:04,125
AND OUR FAMILY HAS NEVER BEEN
THE SAME SINCE.

336
00:19:04,166 --> 00:19:05,875
PLEASE, BAATAR.

337
00:19:05,917 --> 00:19:07,917
STOP ALL OF THIS AND COME HOME.

338
00:19:07,959 --> 00:19:10,458
WE WANT YOU BACK WITH US.

339
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:13,166
- KUVIRA IS MY FAMILY NOW.

340
00:19:16,583 --> 00:19:20,250
- WE'RE GOING ABOUT THIS
ALL WRONG.

341
00:19:20,291 --> 00:19:22,917
YOU'RE RIGHT, I'M NOT GOING TO
PHYSICALLY HURT YOU

342
00:19:22,959 --> 00:19:25,375
IF YOU DON'T TALK. BUT THERE IS
SOMETHING I CAN DO

343
00:19:25,417 --> 00:19:27,834
THAT WILL BE EVEN MORE PAINFUL.

344
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:30,875
I WILL TAKE AWAY THE ONE THING
YOU CARE FOR THE MOST--

345
00:19:30,917 --> 00:19:33,000
KUVIRA.

346
00:19:33,041 --> 00:19:34,125
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

347
00:19:34,166 --> 00:19:35,542
- KUVIRA MIGHT WIN.

348
00:19:35,583 --> 00:19:37,834
SHE MIGHT CHASE US
OUT OF THE CITY.

349
00:19:37,875 --> 00:19:39,959
BUT YOU WON'T BE AROUND TO
ENJOY THE VICTORY.

350
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,333
BECAUSE WHEREVER I RUN,
I'LL TAKE YOU.

351
00:19:43,375 --> 00:19:46,333
I'M GOING TO MAKE IT MY LIFE'S
MISSION TO NEVER LET YOU

352
00:19:46,375 --> 00:19:48,333
SEE THE ONE YOU LOVE AGAIN.

353
00:19:48,375 --> 00:19:51,333
IS TAKING THE CITY WORTH
LOSING KUVIRA FOREVER?

354
00:19:51,375 --> 00:19:53,542
- YOU CAN'T.
- I WILL.

355
00:19:53,583 --> 00:19:56,417
UNLESS YOU CONVINCE KUVIRA TO
BACK OFF.

356
00:19:56,458 --> 00:19:58,625
YOU TWO WILL STILL HAVE
THE EARTH EMPIRE,

357
00:19:58,667 --> 00:20:01,583
JUST LEAVE
THE UNITED REPUBLIC ALONE.

358
00:20:10,417 --> 00:20:13,125
- IT'S KUVIRA. SHE WANTS
TO TALK TO BAATAR.

359
00:20:13,166 --> 00:20:15,542
WHAT SHOULD I TELL HER?

360
00:20:15,583 --> 00:20:17,333
- FOR GOODNESS SAKE,
GIVE ME THAT RADIO.

361
00:20:17,375 --> 00:20:21,250
LET ME TALK TO HER.

362
00:20:21,291 --> 00:20:23,083
KUVIRA, THIS IS RAIKO.

363
00:20:23,125 --> 00:20:25,083
WHAT KIND OF GAME
ARE YOU PLAYING?

364
00:20:25,125 --> 00:20:27,166
YOU TOLD ME YOU WOULD SEND
BAATAR OVER WITH YOUR TERMS,

365
00:20:27,208 --> 00:20:28,709
AND THEN HE DOESN'T SHOW.

366
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:30,959
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN
HE DIDN'T SHOW?

367
00:20:31,041 --> 00:20:33,500
- ACCORDING TO YOUR PEOPLE,
HE'S NOT ON THE AIRSHIP.

368
00:20:33,542 --> 00:20:35,875
- IF HE'S NOT ON THE AIRSHIP
THEN WHERE IS HE?

369
00:20:35,917 --> 00:20:39,083
- [radio transmission]
KUVIRA, IT'S BAATAR.

370
00:20:39,125 --> 00:20:40,875
I'VE BEEN CAPTURED.

371
00:20:40,917 --> 00:20:43,834
MY AIRSHIP WAS AMBUSHED AND
I WAS TAKEN BY FORCE.

372
00:20:43,875 --> 00:20:46,959
KORRA REFUSES TO RELEASE ME
UNLESS WE BACK DOWN

373
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,250
AND LEAVE THE CITY.

374
00:20:48,291 --> 00:20:50,792
- ARE YOU INJURED?
- I'M FINE.

375
00:20:50,834 --> 00:20:52,333
- IS THE AVATAR THERE
WITH YOU NOW?

376
00:20:52,375 --> 00:20:55,959
- YES. EVERYONE IS HERE.

377
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,959
- FIND OUT WHERE
THAT RADIO SIGNAL'S COMING FROM.

378
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,709
- LISTEN TO ME.

379
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:02,041
IF YOU TRY TO TAKE
REPUBLIC CITY,

380
00:21:02,083 --> 00:21:05,083
THE AVATAR WILL NEVER LET ME
SEE YOU AGAIN

381
00:21:05,125 --> 00:21:07,625
AND I REFUSE TO LIVE THAT WAY.

382
00:21:07,667 --> 00:21:10,458
FORGET THE UNITED REPUBLIC.
WE HAVE OUR EMPIRE.

383
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:12,333
WE HAVE EACH OTHER.

384
00:21:12,375 --> 00:21:14,959
LET'S GO BACK HOME AND
GET MARRIED.

385
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,917
THE ONLY THING THAT MATTERS IS
THAT WE'RE TOGETHER

386
00:21:16,959 --> 00:21:18,667
FOR THE REST OF OUR LIVES.

387
00:21:18,709 --> 00:21:22,208
- WE'VE IDENTIFIED
THEIR POSITION.

388
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:25,291
- YOU'RE RIGHT, THIS CITY
ISN'T WORTH SACRIFICING

389
00:21:25,333 --> 00:21:27,959
OUR LIFE TOGETHER.

390
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,959
I LOVE YOU, BAATAR.

391
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,041
- AS SOON AS WE WORK OUT TERMS
WITH KUVIRA,

392
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:35,083
WE'LL LET YOU OUT OF HERE.

393
00:21:39,583 --> 00:21:41,917
- GUYS!
SHE MUST HAVE OUR LOCATION!

394
00:21:41,959 --> 00:21:44,375
SHE'S POINT THAT WEAPON
RIGHT AT US.

395
00:21:44,417 --> 00:21:45,875
- NO, SHE WOULDN'T--

396
00:21:49,166 --> 00:21:50,709
- EVERYONE OUT!
NOW!

397
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:52,333
NOW!

398
00:22:03,458 --> 00:22:05,834
- NO.
- KEEP THE PRESIDENT SAFE.

399
00:22:05,875 --> 00:22:07,834
I'M GOING TO CHECK
FOR SURVIVORS.
