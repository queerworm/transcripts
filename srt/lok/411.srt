1
00:00:06,424 --> 00:00:07,591
EARTH.

2
00:00:07,675 --> 00:00:09,385
FIRE.

3
00:00:09,468 --> 00:00:11,178
AIR.

4
00:00:11,262 --> 00:00:13,097
WATER.

5
00:00:14,098 --> 00:00:18,019
ONLY THE AVATAR CAN MASTER
ALL FOUR ELEMENTS

6
00:00:18,102 --> 00:00:20,354
AND BRING BALANCE TO THE WORLD.

7
00:00:25,943 --> 00:00:27,862
Shiro: BOLIN, OPAL, AND LIN
RESCUED THE BEIFONGS

8
00:00:27,945 --> 00:00:29,572
AND ZHU LI FROM KUVIRA.

9
00:00:29,655 --> 00:00:30,990
NOW THEY'RE RACING TO REPUBLIC CITY

10
00:00:31,073 --> 00:00:33,159
TO ALERT EVERYONE ABOUT
THE EARTH EMPIRE'S

11
00:00:33,242 --> 00:00:34,535
IMMINENT ATTACK. MEANWHILE,

12
00:00:34,618 --> 00:00:36,454
KORRA AND TEAM AVATAR HAVE
BEEN PREPARING FOR

13
00:00:36,537 --> 00:00:37,705
JUST SUCH AN EVENT.

14
00:00:37,788 --> 00:00:39,582
PRINCE WU IS LEADING
AN EVACUATION EFFORT

15
00:00:39,665 --> 00:00:42,543
WHILE ASAMI AND VARRICK ARE
CREATING FLYING MECHA-SUITS.

16
00:00:42,626 --> 00:00:44,712
BUT WITH KUVIRA PLANNING TO
STRIKE IN ONLY TWO WEEKS,

17
00:00:44,795 --> 00:00:46,088
WILL THEY BE READY IN TIME?

18
00:00:54,055 --> 00:00:57,099
Kuvira: TODAY WE STAND ON
THE PRECIPICE OF HISTORY.

19
00:00:57,183 --> 00:01:01,062
FOR THE PAST THREE YEARS,
WE'VE FOUGHT SIDE BY SIDE

20
00:01:01,145 --> 00:01:02,688
TO UNITE THE EARTH EMPIRE

21
00:01:02,772 --> 00:01:05,691
AND WE'VE PROVEN THAT
NO ONE CAN STAND IN OUR WAY.

22
00:01:05,775 --> 00:01:08,110
NOT EVEN THE AVATAR.

23
00:01:08,194 --> 00:01:11,238
BUT OUR MISSION IS NOT YET COMPLETE.

24
00:01:11,322 --> 00:01:14,867
THERE IS A GRAVE INJUSTICE
THAT MUST BE CORRECTED.

25
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:17,578
AS YOU ALL KNOW,
AFTER THE HUNDRED YEAR WAR,

26
00:01:17,661 --> 00:01:20,748
AVATAR AANG, ALONG WITH
FIRE LORD ZUKO

27
00:01:20,831 --> 00:01:24,335
STOLE EARTH EMPIRE LAND AND
FORMED THE UNITED REPUBLIC.

28
00:01:25,002 --> 00:01:28,089
THIS LAND BELONGS TO THE
PEOPLE OF THE EARTH EMPIRE

29
00:01:28,172 --> 00:01:30,424
AND IT'S TIME TO TAKE IT BACK.

30
00:01:30,508 --> 00:01:33,010
REPUBLIC CITY WILL BE OURS!

31
00:01:33,844 --> 00:01:36,388
All: ALL HAIL THE GREAT UNITER!

32
00:01:39,767 --> 00:01:40,976
ARE YOU READY TO SHOW
THE WORLD

33
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:43,020
WHAT A TRUE SUPER POWER LOOKS LIKE?

34
00:01:43,354 --> 00:01:47,316
YES. I'M HONORED TO MARCH
INTO THE CITY BY YOUR SIDE.

35
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:49,026
I LOVE YOU, KUVIRA.

36
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:51,612
I NEVER COULD'VE DONE THIS
WITHOUT YOUR HELP.

37
00:01:51,695 --> 00:01:54,448
AFTER WE CLAIM VICTORY,
WE CAN FINALLY GET MARRIED

38
00:01:54,532 --> 00:01:56,408
AND RULE OUR EMPIRE TOGETHER.

39
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:03,582
- HOW'S THE EVACUATION COMING?
- COULD BE BETTER.

40
00:02:03,666 --> 00:02:06,961
AT THIS POINT WE'VE EVACUATED
ALMOST... 18 FAMILIES.

41
00:02:07,044 --> 00:02:10,589
ONLY 18? THERE ARE MILLIONS
OF PEOPLE IN THIS CITY!

42
00:02:10,673 --> 00:02:11,966
- I SAID IT COULD BE BETTER.

43
00:02:12,049 --> 00:02:13,968
THE PROBLEM IS IT'S
A VOLUNTARY EVACUATION

44
00:02:14,051 --> 00:02:15,803
AND THERE AREN'T MANY VOLUNTEERS.

45
00:02:15,886 --> 00:02:17,263
THEY JUST DON'T FEEL LIKE
THEY'RE IN ANY

46
00:02:17,346 --> 00:02:18,597
IMMEDIATE DANGER.

47
00:02:18,681 --> 00:02:20,182
- GUYS! GOOD! YOU'RE ALL HERE.

48
00:02:20,266 --> 00:02:22,977
WHAT'S WITH YOU INTERRUPTING
MY IMPORTANT MEETINGS ALL THE TIME?

49
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:24,145
- SU!

50
00:02:24,228 --> 00:02:26,021
WHAT ARE YOU...YOU'RE OKAY!

51
00:02:26,689 --> 00:02:28,649
I'M SO SORRY ABOUT ZAOFU.

52
00:02:28,732 --> 00:02:29,859
HOW DID YOU ESCAPE?

53
00:02:29,942 --> 00:02:31,652
OPAL, BEIFONG, AND I
RESCUED EVERYONE

54
00:02:31,735 --> 00:02:33,445
BUT WE HAD A RUN IN WITH KUVIRA.

55
00:02:33,529 --> 00:02:35,823
WE SAW HER SUPER SPIRIT WEAPON
UP CLOSE.

56
00:02:35,906 --> 00:02:38,325
LIKE, REALLY CLOSE. WAY TOO CLOSE.

57
00:02:38,409 --> 00:02:40,327
IS SHE GOING TO USE IT
AGAINST REPUBLIC CITY?

58
00:02:40,411 --> 00:02:43,998
YES. I FOUND OUT SHE'S GOING
TO ATTACK IN TWO WEEKS.

59
00:02:44,081 --> 00:02:45,666
OH! AND ZHU LI IS ON
OUR SIDE NOW.

60
00:02:45,749 --> 00:02:47,251
ACTUALLY, SHE NEVER REALLY
SWITCHED SIDES.

61
00:02:47,334 --> 00:02:49,628
AND I'M JUST GONNA LET HER
EXPLAIN THE WHOLE THING, ZHU LI?

62
00:02:50,838 --> 00:02:54,008
I PRETENDED TO BE LOYAL TO KUVIRA SO
I COULD SABOTAGE HER WEAPON.

63
00:02:54,091 --> 00:02:56,969
IT DIDN'T WORK, BUT I DID
OVERHEAR HER PLANS TO ATTACK.

64
00:02:57,553 --> 00:02:59,096
I KNEW SHE WOULDN'T STOP
AT ZAOFU.

65
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:01,056
MY GUESS IS, SHE'S COMING
BY RAIL.

66
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:03,475
IT'S THE ONLY WAY SHE CAN
TRANSPORT THAT WEAPON.

67
00:03:03,559 --> 00:03:04,852
THEN WE'LL CUT
THE RAIL LINES.

68
00:03:04,935 --> 00:03:06,729
I AGREE. BUT LET'S GET
AS MANY CITIZENS

69
00:03:06,812 --> 00:03:09,023
EVACUATED BEFORE WE DO.
PUT OUT THE ANNOUNCEMENT.

70
00:03:09,315 --> 00:03:11,358
THE EVACUATION IS NOW MANDATORY.

71
00:03:11,442 --> 00:03:13,861
- WE'RE ON IT.
- DON'T WORRY, MR. PRESIDENT.

72
00:03:13,944 --> 00:03:16,238
I WON'T LET KUVIRA TAKE OUR CITY.

73
00:03:23,996 --> 00:03:26,165
WELD HOTTER!
TIGHTEN TIGHTER!

74
00:03:26,248 --> 00:03:28,000
THE PRESIDENT SAID
WE ONLY HAVE TWO WEEKS

75
00:03:28,083 --> 00:03:29,627
TO GET THESE HUMMINGBIRDS HUMMING!

76
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:34,173
- VARRICK, GOOD, YOU'RE HERE.

77
00:03:34,256 --> 00:03:35,549
CAN I TALK TO YOU FOR A MINUTE?

78
00:03:35,633 --> 00:03:38,344
WHAT IS IT? I'M BUSY
INSPIRING MY WORKERS.

79
00:03:38,427 --> 00:03:40,846
WELL, I WENT TO ZAOFU
AND SAVED SU AND HER FAMILY...

80
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:43,182
AND GUESS WHO ELSE WE FOUND... HA!

81
00:03:46,477 --> 00:03:47,436
- ZHU LI.

82
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:51,106
NOW, ISN'T THERE SOMETHING
YOU WANTED TO SAY TO HER?

83
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:54,026
- HMM?
- PLEASE, LET ME GO FIRST.

84
00:03:54,109 --> 00:03:57,488
I KNOW I SAID A LOT OF TERRIBLE THINGS
ABOUT YOU IN FRONT OF KUVIRA,

85
00:03:57,571 --> 00:04:01,033
BUT I NEED YOU TO KNOW,
I DIDN'T MEAN ONE WORD.

86
00:04:01,116 --> 00:04:04,245
WHEN YOU WERE BEING TAKEN
AWAY, I THOUGHT MY ONLY CHANCE

87
00:04:04,328 --> 00:04:05,955
TO SAVE YOU WAS TO JOIN HER.

88
00:04:06,038 --> 00:04:09,208
BUT EVERY DAY I HOPED FOR THE
CHANCE TO SEE YOU AGAIN

89
00:04:09,291 --> 00:04:11,168
AND TELL YOU THE TRUTH.

90
00:04:11,543 --> 00:04:14,630
VARRICK, YOU MEAN THE WORLD TO ME,

91
00:04:14,713 --> 00:04:17,675
AND I'M SORRY IF I HURT YOU IN ANY WAY.

92
00:04:17,925 --> 00:04:19,843
DON'T BE SO
HARD ON YOURSELF.

93
00:04:21,512 --> 00:04:22,972
APOLOGY ACCEPTED!

94
00:04:23,055 --> 00:04:26,100
NOW BE A GOOD ASSISTANT AND
MAN THE ASSEMBLY LINE!

95
00:04:26,183 --> 00:04:28,936
NO! I AM NOT YOUR ASSISTANT
ANYMORE!

96
00:04:29,019 --> 00:04:30,271
IF YOU WANT ME AROUND,

97
00:04:30,354 --> 00:04:32,481
YOU NEED TO START TREATING ME
LIKE AN EQUAL.

98
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:44,660
WE'RE PATCHED IN ON
THE EMERGENCY BROADCAST LINE.

99
00:04:44,743 --> 00:04:46,787
YOU'RE GOING OUT
TO EVERY RADIO IN THE CITY.

100
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:50,666
ATTENTION CITIZENS
OF REPUBLIC CITY, THIS IS NOT A TEST.

101
00:04:50,749 --> 00:04:52,418
AN ATTACK ON OUR CITY IS IMMINENT.

102
00:04:52,501 --> 00:04:55,462
PRESIDENT RAIKO HAS ORDERED
A MANDATORY EVACUATION

103
00:04:55,546 --> 00:04:56,797
FOR ALL CITIZENS.

104
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,674
PLEASE FIND
YOUR EVACUATION HANDBOOKS

105
00:04:58,757 --> 00:05:01,343
AND TURN TO SUB-SECTION
ONE DASH TWO SIX.

106
00:05:01,427 --> 00:05:04,179
THERE YOU WILL FIND INITIAL
INSTRUCTIONS FOR YOUR AREA.

107
00:05:04,263 --> 00:05:07,016
FOR EXAMPLE, IF YOU LIVE IN
NORTHWEST-VECTOR-ONE

108
00:05:07,099 --> 00:05:09,226
REPORT TO YOUR PRIMARY MEETING
LOCATION

109
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:11,103
WHICH WOULD BE AT
THE EASTERN ENTRANCE

110
00:05:11,186 --> 00:05:13,397
OF THE SOUTHERN WATER TRIBE LIBRARY.

111
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,941
THERE, YOU WILL CHOOSE
A LEADER AS SPECIFIED IN

112
00:05:16,025 --> 00:05:18,193
SECTION ONE DASH TWO EIGHT.

113
00:05:18,277 --> 00:05:20,321
UH, CHIEF, WE'RE GETTING
CONFUSED CALLS

114
00:05:20,404 --> 00:05:23,324
FROM ALL OVER THE CITY.
I THINK MAKO'S STARTING A PANIC.

115
00:05:23,407 --> 00:05:26,952
WHAT'S CONFUSING? I'M GIVING
VERY SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS.

116
00:05:27,036 --> 00:05:29,163
GREAT, THIS IS JUST WHAT
WE NEED.

117
00:05:29,246 --> 00:05:30,456
- I GOT THIS.

118
00:05:31,707 --> 00:05:34,335
HELLO, EVERYONE. THIS IS PRINCE WU.

119
00:05:34,418 --> 00:05:36,378
NOW I KNOW YOU'RE ALL
A LITTLE SCARED.

120
00:05:36,462 --> 00:05:39,173
BELIEVE ME, I KNOW WHAT IT'S
LIKE TO BE AFRAID.

121
00:05:39,256 --> 00:05:42,051
I USED TO NOT BE ABLE TO GO TO
THE BATHROOM BY MYSELF.

122
00:05:42,134 --> 00:05:44,428
BUT IF WE LET THAT FEAR CONTROL US,

123
00:05:44,511 --> 00:05:47,348
NONE OF US WILL EVER BE ABLE
TO GO TO THE BATHROOM,

124
00:05:47,431 --> 00:05:49,099
AND THEN WE ALL LOSE.

125
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:53,145
BUT THE PEOPLE OF REPUBLIC CITY
AREN'T LOSERS, WE'RE WINNERS!

126
00:05:53,228 --> 00:05:55,564
WINNERS THAT ARE GOING TO GET
OUT OF THIS CITY

127
00:05:55,647 --> 00:05:57,649
IN A CALM AND ORDERLY FASHION.

128
00:05:57,733 --> 00:05:59,568
SO I WANT YOU TO GRAB YOUR FAMILY,

129
00:05:59,651 --> 00:06:00,778
GRAB YOUR NEIGHBOR,

130
00:06:00,861 --> 00:06:03,197
GRAB THAT GUY DOWN THE STREET
YOU DON'T KNOW VERY WELL

131
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:06,283
AND HEAD TO THE NEAREST
BUS, TRAIN, OR FERRY STATION.

132
00:06:06,367 --> 00:06:08,160
WE'RE GOING TO GET YOU OUT OF HERE,

133
00:06:08,243 --> 00:06:09,995
SAFE AND SOUND.

134
00:06:16,627 --> 00:06:17,878
- GOOD JOB, KID.

135
00:06:17,961 --> 00:06:20,631
YOU MIGHT NOT MAKE SUCH A BAD
KING AFTER ALL.

136
00:06:22,925 --> 00:06:24,385
- ROHAN'S WITH THE ACOLYTES.

137
00:06:24,468 --> 00:06:26,095
THEY HAVE THE BOAT READY TO LEAVE.

138
00:06:26,178 --> 00:06:27,888
WHY AREN'T YOU ALL PACKED YET?

139
00:06:27,971 --> 00:06:29,306
THE KIDS AND I HAVE
BEEN TALKING

140
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:31,058
AND WE DECIDED WE WANNA STAY.

141
00:06:31,141 --> 00:06:33,143
THIS IS OUR CITY, AND IT'S GOING TO NEED

142
00:06:33,227 --> 00:06:34,478
ALL THE HELP IT CAN GET.

143
00:06:34,812 --> 00:06:38,607
YEAH! ONLY A COWARD
FLEES HIS FATE.

144
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:39,858
- THANK YOU.

145
00:06:41,443 --> 00:06:44,571
I'M SURE PRINCE WU COULD USE
YOUR HELP WITH THE EVACUATION.

146
00:06:44,655 --> 00:06:46,281
AND YOU THREE CAN HELP
THE OTHER AIRBENDERS

147
00:06:46,365 --> 00:06:48,826
KEEP AN EYE ON THE EARTH
EMPIRE TROOPS FROM ABOVE.

148
00:06:49,118 --> 00:06:52,704
KUVIRA WILL RUE THE DAY SHE
MESSED WITH MEELO!

149
00:07:35,497 --> 00:07:38,167
Raiko: I STILL DON'T LIKE HAVING TO
ABANDON MY OFFICE AND THE CITY.

150
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:40,544
AIR TEMPLE ISLAND IS
THE IDEAL LOCATION

151
00:07:40,627 --> 00:07:43,422
FOR YOUR BASE OF OPERATIONS.
AND YOU'LL BE SAFE HERE.

152
00:07:43,505 --> 00:07:45,132
THERE'S SOMETHING WE NEED TO
DISCUSS WITH YOU.

153
00:07:45,215 --> 00:07:46,216
- WHAT IS IT?

154
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:48,051
THE FOUR OF US
HAVE BEEN TALKING AND...

155
00:07:48,135 --> 00:07:49,970
WE WANT TO TAKE OUT
KUVIRA'S SPIRIT WEAPON

156
00:07:50,053 --> 00:07:51,847
BEFORE IT GETS TOO CLOSE TO THE CITY.

157
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:54,475
THAT SOUNDS LIKE A RISK WE
DON'T NEED TO TAKE.

158
00:07:54,558 --> 00:07:56,059
THE EVACUATION IS ON SCHEDULE

159
00:07:56,143 --> 00:07:58,312
AND GENERAL IROH IS GETTING
HIS ARMY IN PLACE.

160
00:07:58,395 --> 00:08:01,356
I KNOW IROH CAN GO TOE
TO TOE WITH KUVIRA'S ARMY,

161
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,692
- BUT THAT WEAPON...
- IT'S TOO POWERFUL!

162
00:08:03,775 --> 00:08:04,943
IT CAN DESTROY THE CITY!

163
00:08:05,027 --> 00:08:06,487
WE CAN'T LET IT GET TO
OUR DOORSTEP.

164
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:09,156
WE'LL SNEAK BEHIND ENEMY
LINES AND DISABLE THE WEAPON.

165
00:08:09,239 --> 00:08:11,825
IF IT WORKS, IT'LL EVEN
THE PLAYING FIELD.

166
00:08:11,909 --> 00:08:14,161
- BUT IF YOU GET CAUGHT...
- IT'S WORTH THE RISK.

167
00:08:14,244 --> 00:08:16,955
I AGREE, AND IT MIGHT BE
OUR ONLY SHOT

168
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:19,166
AT PREVENTING AN ALL-OUT WAR.

169
00:08:19,249 --> 00:08:21,752
- GOOD LUCK.
- WE'LL HEAD OUT TONIGHT.

170
00:08:30,886 --> 00:08:32,513
- THERE'S SOMETHING OUT THERE.

171
00:08:35,224 --> 00:08:38,310
IT'S KUVIRA'S ARMY!
THEY'RE A WEEK EARLY!

172
00:08:38,393 --> 00:08:41,522
GET THE COMMANDER IMMEDIATELY,
AND RADIO REPUBLIC CITY!

173
00:09:12,302 --> 00:09:14,763
GUYS, I SEE
SOMETHING. DOWN THERE!

174
00:09:18,809 --> 00:09:20,519
- IS THAT?
- KUVIRA.

175
00:09:20,602 --> 00:09:22,896
SHE'S ALREADY CROSSED INTO
UNITED REPUBLIC TERRITORY.

176
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:24,314
SHE'S A WEEK EARLY.

177
00:09:24,398 --> 00:09:25,983
- THIS DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.

178
00:09:26,066 --> 00:09:27,734
THERE AREN'T ANY TRAIN TRACKS
THIS WAY.

179
00:09:27,818 --> 00:09:30,070
HOW ARE THEY TRANSPORTING THAT
SUPER WEAPON OF THEIRS?

180
00:09:39,496 --> 00:09:41,540
APPARENTLY ON A GIANT
MECHA-SUIT.

181
00:09:48,338 --> 00:09:50,799
DID YOU KNOW KUVIRA WAS
BUILDING THAT THING?

182
00:09:50,882 --> 00:09:52,134
OH, DID I FORGET
TO MENTION IT?

183
00:09:52,217 --> 00:09:53,427
NO! OF COURSE I DIDN'T KNOW!

184
00:09:55,387 --> 00:09:56,888
THERE'S A FLYING BISON
UP AHEAD.

185
00:09:57,514 --> 00:09:58,974
- THE AVATAR...

186
00:10:15,866 --> 00:10:18,702
I KNOW WHAT HAPPENS NEXT!
WE GOTTA GET OUTTA HERE NOW!

187
00:10:18,785 --> 00:10:19,911
NOW!

188
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:43,268
- SHOULD WE GO AFTER THEM?

189
00:10:43,352 --> 00:10:44,936
THEY'RE GOING TO WARN REPUBLIC CITY.

190
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:46,229
- LET THEM.

191
00:10:46,313 --> 00:10:48,148
NO ONE CAN STOP US.

192
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:00,202
KORRA, ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?
WHY ARE YOU BACK SO SOON?

193
00:11:00,285 --> 00:11:02,412
IT'S KUVIRA.
OUR INTEL WAS WRONG.

194
00:11:02,496 --> 00:11:04,498
SHE MUST'VE KNOW ZHU LI HAD
THE INFORMATION.

195
00:11:04,581 --> 00:11:05,791
- WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO SAY?

196
00:11:05,874 --> 00:11:08,210
KUVIRA'S ARMY IS ONLY
A FEW HOURS AWAY.

197
00:11:08,293 --> 00:11:10,087
NO, THEY CAN'T BE...
WE'RE NOT READY.

198
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:11,213
AND THAT SPIRIT
WEAPON OF HERS

199
00:11:11,296 --> 00:11:13,173
IS ATTACHED TO A GIANT MECHA-SUIT.

200
00:11:13,256 --> 00:11:15,175
IT'S OVER 25 STORIES TALL.

201
00:11:15,384 --> 00:11:17,010
GET GENERAL IROH ON THE LINE
AND TELL HIM

202
00:11:17,094 --> 00:11:18,553
THE ATTACK IS HAPPENING TODAY.

203
00:11:18,637 --> 00:11:20,013
WE NEED TO LOCK DOWN THIS CITY.

204
00:11:20,097 --> 00:11:23,266
PEMA, FIND WU AND GET THE REMAINING
CITIZENS TO SAFETY IMMEDIATELY.

205
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:25,102
WE CAN'T HAVE INNOCENT LIVES
IN JEOPARDY.

206
00:11:25,185 --> 00:11:27,354
- WHAT SHOULD WE DO?
- LET'S GO TO MY FACTORY.

207
00:11:27,437 --> 00:11:30,148
MAYBE WE CAN GET A FEW OF THOSE
HUMMINGBIRD SUITS UP AND RUNNING.

208
00:11:30,232 --> 00:11:31,525
- WE'RE COMING WITH YOU.

209
00:11:32,275 --> 00:11:34,986
I'LL HEAD TO THE FRONT LINES
AND HELP GENERAL IROH.

210
00:12:44,097 --> 00:12:45,932
KUVIRA THIS IS
PRESIDENT RAIKO.

211
00:12:46,016 --> 00:12:47,976
I ORDER YOU TO STAND DOWN.

212
00:12:48,059 --> 00:12:49,853
TURN YOUR ARMY AROUND AND LEAVE.

213
00:12:49,936 --> 00:12:52,731
YOU'RE IN NO POSITION
TO GIVE ORDERS.

214
00:12:52,814 --> 00:12:54,274
STAND DOWN
OR WE WILL ATTACK.

215
00:12:54,357 --> 00:12:57,611
I DON'T THINK YOU UNDERSTAND
THE POWER I POSSESS.

216
00:12:57,694 --> 00:12:59,321
LET ME MAKE IT CLEAR.

217
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:26,807
THIS IS EXACTLY WHY I DIDN'T
WANT TO BUILD THAT WEAPON!

218
00:13:45,867 --> 00:13:49,162
MR. PRESIDENT, DO I HAVE
YOUR ORDER TO ENGAGE?

219
00:13:49,246 --> 00:13:52,249
Kuvira: YOU HAVE THREE
SECONDS OR I WIPE OUT YOUR ARMY.

220
00:13:54,209 --> 00:13:57,128
- I HAVE NO CHOICE.
- TIME'S UP.

221
00:13:57,212 --> 00:14:01,091
STOP. WE SURRENDER.
REPUBLIC CITY IS YOURS.

222
00:14:02,592 --> 00:14:05,512
GOOD. TURN YOUR ARMY AND
THE AVATAR

223
00:14:05,595 --> 00:14:08,390
OVER TO ME AND GIVE BAATAR
YOUR LOCATION.

224
00:14:08,473 --> 00:14:10,684
HE'LL PRESENT YOU WITH OUR TERMS.

225
00:14:11,476 --> 00:14:12,727
- I'M NOT SURRENDERING!

226
00:14:12,811 --> 00:14:14,646
GET BACK TO THE CITY BEFORE
SHE SEES YOU.

227
00:14:15,313 --> 00:14:17,899
AND KORRA, FIND A WAY TO BEAT
THAT THING.

228
00:14:18,483 --> 00:14:19,818
- I WILL.

229
00:14:22,612 --> 00:14:24,030
Bataar Jr.:
WE'VE DONE IT KUVIRA.

230
00:14:24,114 --> 00:14:25,615
AND I JUST GOT WORD THAT
PRESIDENT RAIKO

231
00:14:25,699 --> 00:14:28,660
IS ON AIR TEMPLE ISLAND.
I'M HEADING THERE NOW.

232
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:35,917
RAIKO SURRENDERED.
IT'S DOWN TO US NOW.

233
00:14:36,001 --> 00:14:37,878
HOW ARE WE SUPPOSED TO FIGHT
AN ENTIRE ARMY,

234
00:14:37,961 --> 00:14:40,088
A MECHA-GIANT,
AND THAT CRAZY WEAPON?

235
00:14:40,171 --> 00:14:43,300
WE CAN'T FIGHT IT,
BUT MAYBE WE CAN CRIPPLE IT. ZHU LI,

236
00:14:43,383 --> 00:14:45,760
WHEN YOU WERE SPYING ON KUVIRA,
DID YOU LEARN ANYTHING ABOUT

237
00:14:45,844 --> 00:14:46,928
THAT METAL MONSTER?

238
00:14:47,012 --> 00:14:49,014
I HAD NO IDEA THEY WERE EVEN
BUILDING IT.

239
00:14:49,097 --> 00:14:52,309
GUESS BAATAR JR. IS A BETTER
INVENTOR THAN I THOUGHT.

240
00:14:52,392 --> 00:14:53,977
DON'T TELL HIM I SAID THAT.

241
00:14:54,811 --> 00:14:56,146
THAT'S IT!

242
00:14:56,229 --> 00:14:57,397
BAATAR JR. BUILT IT...

243
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,107
HE'LL KNOW HOW TO TAKE IT DOWN.

244
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:01,610
I SAY WE CAPTURE HIM AND
GET HIM TO TALK.

245
00:15:01,693 --> 00:15:02,861
- HMM...

246
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:06,531
I KNOW IT'S A LONG SHOT, BUT
IT'S THE ONLY CHANCE WE HAVE

247
00:15:06,615 --> 00:15:09,200
- AND IF WE DON'T...
- KORRA. I'M IN.

248
00:15:09,284 --> 00:15:11,578
WE'LL NEED A STEALTH TEAM OF
AIRBENDERS TO GET IN AND OUT

249
00:15:11,661 --> 00:15:13,246
OF BAATAR'S AIRSHIP UNNOTICED.

250
00:15:13,330 --> 00:15:15,665
TENZIN, BUMI, JINORA, KAI...
LET'S GET MOVING.

251
00:15:18,084 --> 00:15:19,336
- WHAT ABOUT ME?

252
00:15:19,669 --> 00:15:21,713
SORRY BUDDY,
BUT THIS MISSION COUNTS ON

253
00:15:21,796 --> 00:15:24,215
EVERYONE BEING AS SILENT AS POSSIBLE.

254
00:15:24,299 --> 00:15:26,593
AND YOUR FARTS ARE JUST
TOO MUCH OF A WILD CARD.

255
00:15:26,676 --> 00:15:28,678
I CAN BE QUIET!

256
00:15:30,513 --> 00:15:32,265
OKAY. POINT TAKEN.

257
00:15:40,231 --> 00:15:41,441
- IS EVERYONE READY?

258
00:16:50,844 --> 00:16:53,054
YOU'VE MADE
A TERRIBLE MISTAKE.

259
00:16:53,138 --> 00:16:56,016
ONCE KUVIRA FINDS OUT I'M MISSING,
YOU'RE ALL DONE FOR.

260
00:16:56,099 --> 00:16:57,851
THAT'S WHY BEFORE
SHE FINDS OUT,

261
00:16:57,934 --> 00:17:01,062
YOU'RE GOING TO TELL US HOW TO
STOP THAT MECHA-GIANT, OR ELSE...

262
00:17:01,146 --> 00:17:02,605
- OR ELSE WHAT?

263
00:17:07,777 --> 00:17:09,446
YOU WON'T HURT ME.

264
00:17:09,946 --> 00:17:12,782
I KNOW AN EMPTY THREAT WHEN
I SEE ONE.

265
00:17:18,621 --> 00:17:20,290
- WAS THIS YOUR BEST IDEA?

266
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:25,420
YOU'VE LOST, ONLY YOU HAVEN'T
ACCEPTED IT YET.

267
00:17:26,546 --> 00:17:28,214
- LET ME TALK TO HIM.

268
00:17:58,953 --> 00:18:00,121
- ARE YOU SURE?
- CHECK THE ENGINE ROOM.

269
00:18:00,205 --> 00:18:01,873
WHAT'S GOING ON?
IS EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT?

270
00:18:01,956 --> 00:18:03,249
- JUST A MINUTE, SIR.

271
00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:04,959
I'M TELLING YOU, I LOOKED EVERYWHERE.

272
00:18:05,043 --> 00:18:06,669
ALL RIGHT,
ENOUGH WHISPERING.

273
00:18:06,753 --> 00:18:09,839
I'M READY TO DISCUSS THE TERMS
OF THE SURRENDER WITH BAATAR JR.

274
00:18:09,923 --> 00:18:11,883
- WHERE IS HE?
- UH...

275
00:18:11,966 --> 00:18:13,760
I'M NOT REALLY SURE.

276
00:18:16,638 --> 00:18:18,932
- BAATAR...
- IF YOU THINK I'M GOING

277
00:18:19,015 --> 00:18:21,226
TO SPILL ALL MY SECRETS
TO YOU, MOTHER,

278
00:18:21,309 --> 00:18:22,811
YOU'RE SADLY MISTAKEN.

279
00:18:22,894 --> 00:18:24,479
- WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS?

280
00:18:24,562 --> 00:18:26,856
I KNOW YOU SET OUT TO HELP
BETTER THE WORLD

281
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:28,525
BUT THIS IS MADNESS!

282
00:18:28,608 --> 00:18:32,529
IT'S MADNESS TO LET OTHERS TAKE
WHAT'S YOURS AND ACCEPT IT BLINDLY.

283
00:18:32,612 --> 00:18:35,615
THE UNITED REPUBLIC BELONGS TO US.

284
00:18:35,698 --> 00:18:37,158
AND WE'RE TAKING IT BACK.

285
00:18:37,242 --> 00:18:38,785
- BUT AT WHAT COST?

286
00:18:38,868 --> 00:18:40,703
HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE TO LOSE
THEIR LIVES

287
00:18:40,787 --> 00:18:42,455
BEFORE KUVIRA IS SATISFIED?

288
00:18:42,539 --> 00:18:44,582
IT DOESN'T HAVE TO COST
ANY LIVES

289
00:18:44,666 --> 00:18:46,626
IF YOU WOULD ALL JUST SURRENDER.

290
00:18:46,709 --> 00:18:50,046
ALL THAT KUVIRA AND I WANT IS
A UNITED EARTH EMPIRE.

291
00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:54,592
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I DID
TO HURT YOU,

292
00:18:54,676 --> 00:18:57,887
BUT WHATEVER IT WAS, I'M SORRY.

293
00:18:57,971 --> 00:19:00,640
WHEN YOU LEFT ZAOFU,
IT BROKE MY HEART.

294
00:19:00,723 --> 00:19:03,351
AND OUR FAMILY HAS NEVER BEEN
THE SAME SINCE.

295
00:19:03,434 --> 00:19:04,978
PLEASE, BAATAR.

296
00:19:05,061 --> 00:19:06,688
STOP ALL OF THIS AND COME HOME.

297
00:19:07,063 --> 00:19:09,399
WE WANT YOU BACK WITH US.

298
00:19:09,482 --> 00:19:12,277
- KUVIRA IS MY FAMILY NOW.

299
00:19:15,488 --> 00:19:18,074
WE'RE GOING ABOUT THIS
ALL WRONG.

300
00:19:19,492 --> 00:19:21,703
YOU'RE RIGHT, I'M NOT GOING TO
PHYSICALLY HURT YOU

301
00:19:21,786 --> 00:19:24,581
IF YOU DON'T TALK.
BUT THERE IS SOMETHING I CAN DO

302
00:19:24,664 --> 00:19:26,666
THAT WILL BE EVEN MORE PAINFUL.

303
00:19:26,749 --> 00:19:30,170
I WILL TAKE AWAY THE ONE THING
YOU CARE FOR THE MOST...

304
00:19:30,253 --> 00:19:31,421
KUVIRA.

305
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:33,173
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

306
00:19:33,256 --> 00:19:34,674
- KUVIRA MIGHT WIN.

307
00:19:34,757 --> 00:19:36,634
SHE MIGHT CHASE US OUT OF THE CITY.

308
00:19:36,718 --> 00:19:39,053
BUT YOU WON'T BE AROUND TO
ENJOY THE VICTORY.

309
00:19:39,137 --> 00:19:42,140
BECAUSE WHEREVER I RUN, I'LL TAKE YOU.

310
00:19:42,223 --> 00:19:45,435
I'M GOING TO MAKE IT MY LIFE'S
MISSION TO NEVER LET YOU

311
00:19:45,518 --> 00:19:47,395
SEE THE ONE YOU LOVE AGAIN.

312
00:19:47,478 --> 00:19:50,356
IS TAKING THE CITY WORTH
LOSING KUVIRA FOREVER?

313
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:52,525
- YOU CAN'T.
- I WILL.

314
00:19:52,609 --> 00:19:55,486
UNLESS YOU CONVINCE
KUVIRA TO BACK OFF.

315
00:19:55,570 --> 00:19:57,614
YOU TWO WILL STILL HAVE
THE EARTH EMPIRE,

316
00:19:57,697 --> 00:20:00,158
JUST LEAVE THE UNITED REPUBLIC ALONE.

317
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:12,545
IT'S KUVIRA. SHE WANTS
TO TALK TO BAATAR.

318
00:20:12,629 --> 00:20:13,963
WHAT SHOULD I TELL HER?

319
00:20:14,631 --> 00:20:17,634
FOR GOODNESS SAKE,
GIVE ME THAT RADIO. LET ME TALK TO HER.

320
00:20:20,678 --> 00:20:22,222
KUVIRA, THIS IS RAIKO.

321
00:20:22,305 --> 00:20:24,015
WHAT KIND OF GAME ARE YOU PLAYING?

322
00:20:24,098 --> 00:20:26,309
YOU TOLD ME YOU WOULD SEND
BAATAR OVER WITH YOUR TERMS,

323
00:20:26,392 --> 00:20:27,894
AND THEN HE DOESN'T SHOW.

324
00:20:27,977 --> 00:20:29,896
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
HE DIDN'T SHOW?

325
00:20:29,979 --> 00:20:32,523
ACCORDING TO YOUR PEOPLE,
HE'S NOT ON THE AIRSHIP.

326
00:20:32,607 --> 00:20:34,817
IF HE'S NOT ON THE AIRSHIP
THEN WHERE IS HE?

327
00:20:34,901 --> 00:20:38,112
KUVIRA, IT'S BAATAR.

328
00:20:38,321 --> 00:20:39,864
I'VE BEEN CAPTURED.

329
00:20:39,948 --> 00:20:42,825
MY AIRSHIP WAS AMBUSHED
AND I WAS TAKEN BY FORCE.

330
00:20:42,909 --> 00:20:46,204
KORRA REFUSES TO RELEASE ME
UNLESS WE BACK DOWN

331
00:20:46,287 --> 00:20:47,330
AND LEAVE THE CITY.

332
00:20:47,538 --> 00:20:49,791
- ARE YOU INJURED?
- I'M FINE.

333
00:20:49,874 --> 00:20:51,751
IS THE AVATAR THERE
WITH YOU NOW?

334
00:20:51,834 --> 00:20:53,503
- YES. EVERYONE IS HERE.

335
00:20:55,046 --> 00:20:58,258
FIND OUT WHERE THAT RADIO
SIGNAL'S COMING FROM.

336
00:20:58,341 --> 00:20:59,676
- LISTEN TO ME.

337
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:01,219
IF YOU TRY TO TAKE REPUBLIC CITY,

338
00:21:01,302 --> 00:21:04,305
THE AVATAR WILL NEVER LET ME
SEE YOU AGAIN

339
00:21:04,389 --> 00:21:05,974
AND I REFUSE TO LIVE THAT WAY.

340
00:21:06,766 --> 00:21:09,811
FORGET THE UNITED REPUBLIC.
WE HAVE OUR EMPIRE.

341
00:21:09,894 --> 00:21:11,437
WE HAVE EACH OTHER.

342
00:21:11,521 --> 00:21:13,940
LET'S GO BACK HOME AND GET MARRIED.

343
00:21:14,023 --> 00:21:16,192
THE ONLY THING THAT MATTERS
IS THAT WE'RE TOGETHER

344
00:21:16,276 --> 00:21:17,944
FOR THE REST OF OUR LIVES.

345
00:21:18,027 --> 00:21:19,654
WE'VE IDENTIFIED
THEIR POSITION.

346
00:21:21,197 --> 00:21:25,743
YOU'RE RIGHT, THIS CITY ISN'T WORTH
SACRIFICING OUR LIFE TOGETHER.

347
00:21:26,995 --> 00:21:28,830
I LOVE YOU, BAATAR.

348
00:21:30,164 --> 00:21:32,125
AS SOON AS WE WORK OUT TERMS
WITH KUVIRA,

349
00:21:32,208 --> 00:21:33,376
WE'LL LET YOU OUT OF HERE.

350
00:21:38,965 --> 00:21:41,134
GUYS!
SHE MUST HAVE OUR LOCATION!

351
00:21:41,217 --> 00:21:43,219
SHE'S POINTING THAT
WEAPON RIGHT AT US.

352
00:21:43,428 --> 00:21:45,096
- NO, SHE WOULDN'T...

353
00:21:48,099 --> 00:21:50,101
EVERYONE OUT!
NOW! NOW!

354
00:22:02,655 --> 00:22:04,866
- NO.
- KEEP THE PRESIDENT SAFE.

355
00:22:04,949 --> 00:22:06,701
I'M GOING TO CHECK FOR SURVIVORS.
