1
00:00:07,417 --> 00:00:08,542
- EARTH.

2
00:00:08,583 --> 00:00:10,500
FIRE.

3
00:00:10,542 --> 00:00:12,291
AIR.

4
00:00:12,333 --> 00:00:13,917
WATER.

5
00:00:13,959 --> 00:00:18,625
ONLY THE AVATAR CAN MASTER
ALL FOUR ELEMENTS

6
00:00:18,667 --> 00:00:20,500
AND BRING BALANCE
TO THE WORLD.

7
00:00:20,542 --> 00:00:23,208
[dramatic music]

8
00:00:27,166 --> 00:00:28,709
- THE RED LOTUS IS
THE WORLD'S NEWEST THREAT.

9
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:30,458
AFTER CONFRONTING ZAHEER,

10
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:33,041
KORRA LEARNED HE IS PART
OF A SECRET SOCIETY

11
00:00:33,083 --> 00:00:35,291
WHOSE MISSION IS TO TAKE OUT
ALL THE NATION'S LEADERS

12
00:00:35,333 --> 00:00:36,709
AND DESTROY WORLD ORDER.

13
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:38,667
BUT BEFORE KORRA
COULD WARN ANYONE,

14
00:00:38,709 --> 00:00:40,208
SHE AND ASAMI
WERE APPREHENDED

15
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:41,792
BY THE EARTH QUEEN'S FORCES.

16
00:00:41,834 --> 00:00:44,500
AND THE RED LOTUS
NABBED MAKO AND BOLIN.

17
00:00:44,542 --> 00:00:47,000
NOW BOTH PARTIES ARE HEADED
TOWARD BA SING SE.

18
00:00:56,208 --> 00:00:58,041
- YOU HAVE TO LET ME OUT.

19
00:00:58,083 --> 00:01:00,375
THE EARTH QUEEN IS IN DANGER
FROM A GROUP OF TERRORISTS

20
00:01:00,417 --> 00:01:02,291
CALLING THEMSELVES
THE RED LOTUS.

21
00:01:02,333 --> 00:01:04,625
I TALKED TO ONE OF THEM
IN THE SPIRIT WORLD YESTERDAY.

22
00:01:04,667 --> 00:01:06,583
HE'S INSANE.

23
00:01:06,625 --> 00:01:09,375
- SCREAMING ABOUT TERRORISTS
IN THE SPIRIT WORLD?

24
00:01:09,417 --> 00:01:11,417
YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO SOUNDS INSANE.

25
00:01:24,542 --> 00:01:27,625
- DO I HAVE TO BE CHAINED
TO THE FLOOR THE WHOLE WAY?

26
00:01:27,667 --> 00:01:29,625
IT'S GOING TO BE
SO UNCOMFORTABLE.

27
00:01:29,667 --> 00:01:31,542
- SORRY, MA'AM.
I'M UNDER ORDERS.

28
00:01:31,583 --> 00:01:34,000
- CAN'T YOU JUST CHAIN ME
TO THAT RAILING?

29
00:01:34,041 --> 00:01:36,375
I MEAN,
WHERE AM I GONNA GO?

30
00:01:36,417 --> 00:01:38,834
PLEASE.

31
00:01:38,875 --> 00:01:40,375
- WELL, AS LONG AS
YOU'RE CHAINED UP,

32
00:01:40,417 --> 00:01:42,542
I GUESS IT DOESN'T
MAKE A DIFFERENCE.

33
00:01:45,709 --> 00:01:48,166
- THANK YOU, SIR.

34
00:01:48,208 --> 00:01:50,959
- CAN I HAVE SOME WATER?
- NO WATER.

35
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,709
WE'RE ALSO NOT GONNA BRING YOU
ANY ROCKS OR FIRE,

36
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:54,125
SO DON'T ASK.

37
00:01:54,166 --> 00:01:55,834
I GUESS THERE'S AIR,

38
00:01:55,875 --> 00:01:58,000
BUT THERE'S NOTHING
WE CAN DO ABOUT THAT.

39
00:01:58,041 --> 00:01:59,625
WE'RE NOT OPENING
YOUR COMPARTMENT

40
00:01:59,667 --> 00:02:02,291
UNTIL WE REACH
BA SING SE.

41
00:02:02,333 --> 00:02:04,041
- I HOPED MAKO AND BOLIN

42
00:02:04,083 --> 00:02:06,208
WOULD HAVE SHOWN UP
TO SAVE US BY NOW.

43
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:08,250
I WONDER IF THEY'RE OKAY.

44
00:02:10,542 --> 00:02:12,667
- IF YOU THINK
HOLDING US HOSTAGE

45
00:02:12,709 --> 00:02:14,625
WILL GIVE YOU SOME LEVERAGE
TO USE AGAINST THE AVATAR,

46
00:02:14,667 --> 00:02:16,375
YOU'RE GONNA BE
VERY DISAPPOINTED.

47
00:02:16,417 --> 00:02:20,000
- CAN'T WE JUST ENJOY OUR TIME
TOGETHER IN SILENCE?

48
00:02:20,041 --> 00:02:22,208
- AND WHY DID YOU NEED
KORRA ALIVE BACK IN ZAOFU?

49
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:24,125
YOU HAD HER PARALYZED.

50
00:02:24,166 --> 00:02:26,291
WHY DIDN'T YOU JUST TAKE HER OUT
WHEN YOU HAD THE CHANCE?

51
00:02:26,333 --> 00:02:27,792
- LOOK, ALL YOU NEED TO KNOW

52
00:02:27,834 --> 00:02:29,208
IS THAT THE WORLD
IS ABOUT TO CHANGE,

53
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:30,709
FOR THE BETTER.

54
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:31,750
- SO YOU GUYS WERE, LIKE,

55
00:02:31,792 --> 00:02:34,125
LOCKED UP FOR 15 YEARS, HUH?

56
00:02:34,166 --> 00:02:35,917
THAT MUST HAVE BEEN, LIKE,
CRAZY BORING.

57
00:02:35,959 --> 00:02:37,458
- ACTUALLY,
IT WAS ONLY 13 YEARS,

58
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:39,208
BUT IT FELT LIKE 30.

59
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:41,709
- I MEAN, WHAT DID YOU DO
WITH ALL THAT TIME?

60
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:44,417
DID YOU SING SONGS,
WORK ON CRAFTS?

61
00:02:44,458 --> 00:02:45,667
- NOT A LOT
OF CRAFT SUPPLIES

62
00:02:45,709 --> 00:02:47,333
IN A VOLCANIC PRISON CELL.

63
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:49,333
- AND I MUST HAVE RENAMED
THE CONSTELLATIONS

64
00:02:49,375 --> 00:02:50,959
ABOUT A THOUSAND TIMES.

65
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,291
WHEN IT RAINED,
THAT WAS A BIG EVENT.

66
00:02:53,333 --> 00:02:55,041
- OH, I WOULD'VE KILLED
FOR SOME RAIN.

67
00:02:55,083 --> 00:02:57,500
MOSTLY I JUST MADE UP STORIES
ABOUT THE GUARDS.

68
00:02:57,542 --> 00:02:59,542
WHO WAS HAVING TROUBLE
WITH HIS GIRLFRIEND?

69
00:02:59,583 --> 00:03:01,959
WHICH ONE SECRETLY WISHED
HE'D BECOME A PASTRY CHEF?

70
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,333
- OOH, OKAY,
THAT SOUNDS LIKE FUN.

71
00:03:03,375 --> 00:03:04,750
LET ME TRY THAT
ON YOU GUYS.

72
00:03:04,792 --> 00:03:07,083
YOU WERE RAISED
BY AN OLDER SISTER.

73
00:03:07,125 --> 00:03:09,625
YOUR MUSTACHE GREW IN
WHEN YOU WERE TEN.

74
00:03:09,667 --> 00:03:11,291
AND I'M SENSING--
JUST SENSING--

75
00:03:11,333 --> 00:03:15,125
AN UNSPOKEN ATTRACTION
BETWEEN YOU TWO.

76
00:03:15,166 --> 00:03:17,583
- TWO OUT OF THREE.
NOT BAD.

77
00:03:17,625 --> 00:03:21,250
- BOLIN, WILL YOU STOP MAKING
FRIENDS WITH THE BAD GUYS?

78
00:03:21,291 --> 00:03:23,333
- SORRY.

79
00:03:23,375 --> 00:03:25,917
- GHAZAN, GAG THOSE TWO.
WE'RE ALMOST THERE.

80
00:03:32,333 --> 00:03:34,166
- [grunting]

81
00:03:34,208 --> 00:03:35,959
WE HAVE TO FIND A WAY
OUT OF THIS PRISON

82
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,417
BEFORE WE GET
TO THE EARTH QUEEN.

83
00:03:37,458 --> 00:03:39,500
- DON'T WORRY.
I HAVE A PLAN.

84
00:03:39,542 --> 00:03:41,667
THESE AIRSHIPS THAT CABBAGE CORP
SOLD TO THE EARTH KINGDOM

85
00:03:41,709 --> 00:03:44,333
ARE WAY CHEAPER THAN THE ONES
FUTURE INDUSTRIES BUILT.

86
00:03:46,458 --> 00:03:48,834
[grunting]

87
00:03:53,917 --> 00:03:56,500
NOW, THAT'S JUST
SHODDY WORKMANSHIP.

88
00:03:58,333 --> 00:04:01,291
THERE'S NO WAY I CAN GET
THESE LOCKS OFF.

89
00:04:01,333 --> 00:04:03,208
I NEED THE KEYS.

90
00:04:08,333 --> 00:04:10,792
GIVE ME FIVE MINUTES,
THEN START YELLING FOR HELP.

91
00:04:16,917 --> 00:04:19,917
- WHEN IS THE AVATAR
SCHEDULED FOR DELIVERY?

92
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:22,166
- THE AIRSHIP ALREADY
LEFT FORT BOSCO

93
00:04:22,208 --> 00:04:24,500
AND SHOULD BE ARRIVING
IN A FEW HOURS.

94
00:04:24,542 --> 00:04:26,333
- EXCELLENT.

95
00:04:26,375 --> 00:04:28,458
BRING HER TO ME
AS SOON AS IT LANDS.

96
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,083
- YES, YOUR MAJESTY.

97
00:04:30,125 --> 00:04:32,667
BUT FIRST THERE ARE
SOME PEOPLE HERE

98
00:04:32,709 --> 00:04:35,208
WHO CAPTURED
TWO OF THE AVATAR'S FRIENDS.

99
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:37,375
THEY WOULD LIKE TO PRESENT THEM
TO YOU PERSONALLY.

100
00:04:37,417 --> 00:04:40,583
- YOU KNOW I DON'T MEET
WITH BOUNTY HUNTERS.

101
00:04:40,625 --> 00:04:42,166
- AND OF COURSE
I TOLD THEM THAT,

102
00:04:42,208 --> 00:04:43,959
BUT THEY SAY THEY HAVE
SOME INFORMATION

103
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,709
THAT MIGHT INTEREST YOU

104
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:48,333
ABOUT THE LOCATION
OF YOUR STOLEN AIRBENDERS.

105
00:04:48,375 --> 00:04:49,750
- REALLY?

106
00:04:49,792 --> 00:04:51,458
FINE, SEND THEM IN.

107
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:52,959
[both groan]

108
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,542
AH, YES.

109
00:04:54,583 --> 00:04:56,542
I REMEMBER THESE TWO.

110
00:04:56,583 --> 00:04:59,542
WE'LL FIND AN ACCEPTABLE HOME
FOR YOU IN PRISON

111
00:04:59,583 --> 00:05:01,583
WITH THE REST
OF THE DISSIDENTS.

112
00:05:01,625 --> 00:05:06,834
NOW I'M TOLD YOU HAVE
SOME INFORMATION FOR ME.

113
00:05:06,875 --> 00:05:09,125
I HOPE THIS ISN'T
JUST SOME RUSE

114
00:05:09,166 --> 00:05:11,083
TO TRY TO INCREASE
YOUR BOUNTY.

115
00:05:11,125 --> 00:05:13,208
- WE DON'T WANT ANY BOUNTY,
YOUR MAJESTY.

116
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:15,166
YOU CAN CONSIDER THESE TWO
A THANK-YOU GIFT

117
00:05:15,208 --> 00:05:17,583
FOR SIMPLY TAKING THE TIME
TO TALK TO US.

118
00:05:17,625 --> 00:05:21,125
- HOW VERY MAGNANIMOUS.

119
00:05:21,166 --> 00:05:24,917
SO WHERE ARE MY AIRBENDERS?

120
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:26,417
- I'D BE HAPPY TO TELL YOU

121
00:05:26,458 --> 00:05:28,333
ONCE YOU HAND
THE AVATAR OVER TO ME.

122
00:05:28,375 --> 00:05:30,417
- WHO TOLD YOU
THAT WE HAVE THE AVATAR?

123
00:05:30,458 --> 00:05:31,917
- HOW I KNOW
IS NOT IMPORTANT.

124
00:05:31,959 --> 00:05:34,750
BUT IF I FOUND OUT,
OTHERS WILL TOO.

125
00:05:34,792 --> 00:05:37,000
AND THAT COULD PUT YOU
IN A DIFFICULT POSITION.

126
00:05:37,041 --> 00:05:39,458
- IS THAT SO?

127
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:41,667
- YOUR MAJESTY,
IMPRISONING THE AVATAR

128
00:05:41,709 --> 00:05:43,583
WILL CAUSE THE OTHER NATIONS
TO TURN AGAINST YOU

129
00:05:43,625 --> 00:05:45,208
AND DEMAND HER FREEDOM.

130
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:47,208
BEFORE LONG,
YOU'LL BE IN THE MIDST

131
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:49,291
OF A STICKY
INTERNATIONAL INCIDENT.

132
00:05:49,333 --> 00:05:51,125
BUT IF YOU LET ME
TAKE HER TODAY,

133
00:05:51,166 --> 00:05:53,834
NO ONE NEED EVER KNOW
SHE WAS HERE,

134
00:05:53,875 --> 00:05:56,250
AND YOU CAN GET YOUR AIRBENDERS
BACK WITHOUT INTERFERENCE.

135
00:05:56,291 --> 00:05:57,458
WE BOTH WIN.

136
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:59,583
- AND WHAT DO YOU PLAN TO DO
WITH THE AVATAR,

137
00:05:59,625 --> 00:06:02,417
SHOULD I SEE FIT
TO GRANT YOUR REQUEST?

138
00:06:02,458 --> 00:06:05,792
- ALL I CAN SAY IS THAT
I HAVE BUSINESS WITH HER.

139
00:06:05,834 --> 00:06:07,834
BUT SHE WON'T
BE BOTHERING YOU AGAIN.

140
00:06:07,875 --> 00:06:09,500
I CAN ASSURE YOU OF THAT.

141
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:17,417
- I FIND THESE TERMS
AGREEABLE.

142
00:06:17,458 --> 00:06:20,166
GUN, ESCORT THEM
TO THE ANTECHAMBER

143
00:06:20,208 --> 00:06:23,458
UNTIL THE AVATAR'S ARRIVAL.

144
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:26,333
SEND THESE TWO
TO THE DUNGEON.

145
00:06:26,375 --> 00:06:28,542
[both groan]

146
00:06:34,709 --> 00:06:37,166
- GUARD!
GET IN HERE!

147
00:06:37,208 --> 00:06:38,542
SOMETHING HAPPENED
TO MY FRIEND!

148
00:06:38,583 --> 00:06:40,375
SHE NEEDS HELP!

149
00:06:40,417 --> 00:06:41,792
- WHERE IS SHE?

150
00:06:41,834 --> 00:06:43,834
[thud, groans]

151
00:06:51,083 --> 00:06:52,875
- NICE WORK.

152
00:06:52,917 --> 00:06:54,750
NOW LET'S TAKE CONTROL
OF THIS SHIP.

153
00:07:00,583 --> 00:07:02,291
- [groans]

154
00:07:02,333 --> 00:07:04,250
- MAYDAY, MAYDAY.

155
00:07:04,291 --> 00:07:05,500
THE AVATAR HAS ESCAPED.

156
00:07:05,542 --> 00:07:06,875
WE'RE GOING DOWN
IN QUADRANT FOUR

157
00:07:06,917 --> 00:07:09,291
OF THE SI WONG DESERT.

158
00:07:09,333 --> 00:07:12,583
- [groans]

159
00:07:12,625 --> 00:07:14,291
- I THINK YOU MIGHT HAVE BEEN
A LITTLE OVERAGGRESSIVE

160
00:07:14,333 --> 00:07:15,792
WITH THE AIRBENDING.

161
00:07:15,834 --> 00:07:18,333
THE CONTROLS ARE BUSTED.

162
00:07:18,375 --> 00:07:19,792
ALSO, YOU BROKE THE RADIO.

163
00:07:19,834 --> 00:07:21,500
- SORRY,
BUT IT'S NOT MY FAULT

164
00:07:21,542 --> 00:07:23,208
THIS AIRSHIP'S
A HUNK OF JUNK.

165
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:25,959
- HANG ON TO SOMETHING!

166
00:07:38,542 --> 00:07:40,667
- WELL, THEY SAY ANY LANDING
YOU CAN WALK AWAY FROM

167
00:07:40,709 --> 00:07:41,709
IS A GOOD LANDING.

168
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:43,875
BUT GIVEN OUR LOCATION,

169
00:07:43,917 --> 00:07:45,500
I'M NOT SO SURE ABOUT THAT.

170
00:07:45,542 --> 00:07:47,709
- YOU'RE THE ENGINEER.
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

171
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:48,959
CAN WE GET IT FLYING AGAIN?

172
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,959
- IT DOESN'T LOOK GOOD.

173
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,500
I MEAN, EVEN IF YOU METALBEND
THE PROPELLERS BACK INTO SHAPE,

174
00:07:53,542 --> 00:07:56,500
WE'D HAVE TO DIG THIS
WHOLE THING OUT OF THE SAND.

175
00:07:56,542 --> 00:07:57,625
- IS EVERYONE ALL RIGHT?

176
00:07:57,667 --> 00:07:58,917
- LIKE YOU CARE.

177
00:07:58,959 --> 00:08:00,250
- WHAT THE HECK HAPPENED?

178
00:08:00,291 --> 00:08:01,959
- SHE SAID
HER FRIEND NEEDED HELP.

179
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,667
THEN THEY KNOCKED ME OUT!

180
00:08:03,709 --> 00:08:05,250
- I'M SORRY, BUT I COULDN'T
LET YOU TAKE ME

181
00:08:05,291 --> 00:08:06,917
TO THE EARTH QUEEN
AS A CAPTIVE.

182
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:08,291
THERE ARE
DANGEROUS FORCES AT WORK

183
00:08:08,333 --> 00:08:10,500
THAT YOU DON'T KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT.

184
00:08:10,542 --> 00:08:12,875
- MORE DANGEROUS THAN BEING
STRANDED IN THE DESERT?

185
00:08:12,917 --> 00:08:14,458
- DON'T WORRY, KONG.

186
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:16,792
I RADIOED BA SING SE
BEFORE WE WENT DOWN.

187
00:08:16,834 --> 00:08:18,542
WE JUST NEED
TO SIT TIGHT.

188
00:08:18,583 --> 00:08:20,458
SOMEONE WILL BE HERE SOON
TO RESCUE US.

189
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:21,834
- I'M NOT WAITING AROUND
FOR THAT.

190
00:08:21,875 --> 00:08:23,291
WE NEED TO GET
OUT OF HERE NOW.

191
00:08:23,333 --> 00:08:25,000
- IF WE ALL WORK TOGETHER,

192
00:08:25,041 --> 00:08:26,834
WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO GET
THE SHIP UP AND RUNNING.

193
00:08:26,875 --> 00:08:28,417
- NOT LIKELY.

194
00:08:28,458 --> 00:08:29,667
I JUST TUNNELED OUT
OF THE ENGINE ROOM.

195
00:08:29,709 --> 00:08:31,083
IT'S LIKE A SANDBOX
IN THERE.

196
00:08:31,125 --> 00:08:32,375
- THIS SHIP
ISN'T GOING ANYWHERE,

197
00:08:32,417 --> 00:08:34,125
AND NEITHER ARE YOU.

198
00:08:34,166 --> 00:08:35,792
YOU'RE OUR PRISONERS,
AND IT'S OUR DUTY

199
00:08:35,834 --> 00:08:37,709
TO TRANSPORT YOU
TO THE EARTH QUEEN.

200
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:39,792
- YOU REALIZE
THAT I'M THE AVATAR, RIGHT?

201
00:08:39,834 --> 00:08:41,709
YOU DON'T WANNA FIGHT ME.

202
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:43,875
- I'M AFRAID YOU AREN'T
GIVING US MUCH OF A CHOICE.

203
00:08:43,917 --> 00:08:46,375
WE HAVE OUR ORDERS.

204
00:08:46,417 --> 00:08:49,417
- WAIT, DID THAT SAND DUNE
JUST MOVE?

205
00:08:49,458 --> 00:08:50,917
- IT WAS PROBABLY
JUST A MIRAGE.

206
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:52,667
THE DESERT WILL PLAY
TRICKS ON YOU.

207
00:08:52,709 --> 00:08:53,917
- THAT'S NO MIRAGE.

208
00:08:53,959 --> 00:08:56,583
LOOK.

209
00:09:00,667 --> 00:09:02,500
- I HEARD THAT SINCE
ALL THE SPIRITS CAME BACK,

210
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:04,667
THIS DESERT HAS BEEN
HAUNTED BY THEM.

211
00:09:04,709 --> 00:09:07,750
- OH, RIGHT, SO I GUESS
THAT'S MY FAULT TOO.

212
00:09:07,792 --> 00:09:10,333
DO YOU WANT TO HELP US
GET THIS SHIP UP AND RUNNING,

213
00:09:10,375 --> 00:09:12,583
OR DO YOU WANNA WAIT AROUND
AND MEET THAT THING?

214
00:09:12,625 --> 00:09:16,542
- WE WANNA FIX THE SHIP,
RIGHT, CAP?

215
00:09:16,583 --> 00:09:18,625
- MM, LET'S GET TO WORK.

216
00:09:18,667 --> 00:09:20,875
- EVERYBODY, STAND BACK!

217
00:09:30,792 --> 00:09:32,667
- [groans]

218
00:09:32,709 --> 00:09:34,542
- WE HAVE TO FIND
A WAY OUT OF HERE

219
00:09:34,583 --> 00:09:36,041
BEFORE ZAHEER GETS
HIS HANDS ON KORRA.

220
00:09:36,083 --> 00:09:37,917
- TAKE ME WITH YOU.

221
00:09:37,959 --> 00:09:40,709
I HAVEN'T SEEN MY WIFE
AND FIVE KIDS IN FOUR YEARS.

222
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:42,375
- FOUR YEARS?

223
00:09:42,417 --> 00:09:44,041
- THE FIRST FEW MONTHS
WERE GREAT.

224
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:45,667
I COULD FINALLY
GET SOME SLEEP.

225
00:09:45,709 --> 00:09:47,542
BUT NOW I REALLY MISS THEM.

226
00:09:47,583 --> 00:09:51,375
- LISTEN, BOLIN,
THIS IS UP TO YOU.

227
00:09:51,417 --> 00:09:53,417
I KNOW YOU CAN METALBEND.

228
00:09:53,458 --> 00:09:55,542
- YOU CAN METALBEND?

229
00:09:55,583 --> 00:09:57,166
- NO.

230
00:09:57,208 --> 00:09:59,458
- YES, YOU CAN.
I BELIEVE IN YOU.

231
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,500
- I BELIEVE IN YOU TOO,
BOLIN!

232
00:10:01,542 --> 00:10:04,834
- I APPRECIATE THAT,
MAKO AND FELLOW PRISONER MAN,

233
00:10:04,875 --> 00:10:07,625
BUT I'VE BEEN TRYING
AND TRYING AND TRYING,

234
00:10:07,667 --> 00:10:10,417
AND I'VE NEVER BEEN ABLE
TO DO IT--NOT EVEN A LITTLE.

235
00:10:10,458 --> 00:10:12,208
- YOU'VE ALWAYS HAD
THE ABILITY DEEP DOWN.

236
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:14,000
YOU JUST HAVEN'T HAD
THE RIGHT MOTIVATION.

237
00:10:14,041 --> 00:10:15,625
BUT THIS IS YOUR TIME.

238
00:10:15,667 --> 00:10:17,250
GET US OUT OF HERE
TO SAVE KORRA.

239
00:10:17,291 --> 00:10:18,667
YOU CAN DO IT!

240
00:10:18,709 --> 00:10:21,417
BOLIN! BOLIN!

241
00:10:21,458 --> 00:10:25,208
all: BOLIN! BOLIN!
BOLIN! BOLIN!

242
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:27,834
- YOU'RE RIGHT.
OKAY.

243
00:10:27,875 --> 00:10:29,291
HERE I GO.

244
00:10:29,333 --> 00:10:30,625
METALBENDING!

245
00:10:30,667 --> 00:10:31,625
AGHH!

246
00:10:31,667 --> 00:10:34,166
[groans]

247
00:10:34,208 --> 00:10:36,375
[screaming]

248
00:10:39,417 --> 00:10:41,125
[sighs, sniffles]

249
00:10:41,166 --> 00:10:42,709
I CAN'T METALBEND.

250
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:45,667
all: AWW.

251
00:10:45,709 --> 00:10:47,291
- HEY, YOU GUYS
DIDN'T HAPPEN TO BRING

252
00:10:47,333 --> 00:10:49,583
ANY TOILET PAPER,
DID YOU?

253
00:11:15,959 --> 00:11:16,917
- [screams]

254
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:19,125
[Naga roars]

255
00:11:19,166 --> 00:11:23,333
[Naga panting]

256
00:11:23,375 --> 00:11:24,750
- FIRST YOU SCARE
THE LIFE OUT OF ME,

257
00:11:24,792 --> 00:11:27,750
NOW YOU WANT TO LICK ME.

258
00:11:27,792 --> 00:11:30,458
[Pabu tittering]

259
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:39,625
HERE. CHEW ON THIS,
AND LEAVE ME ALONE.

260
00:11:39,667 --> 00:11:43,083
TONRAQ, YOU READ ME?
- YES. WE COPY.

261
00:11:43,125 --> 00:11:45,458
- I FOUND KORRA'S JEEP,
BUT THE KIDS AREN'T HERE.

262
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:47,709
MEET ME
AT THE MISTY PALMS OASIS.

263
00:11:57,041 --> 00:11:58,792
- HOW'S IT LOOKING IN THERE?

264
00:11:58,834 --> 00:12:01,250
- I JUST AIRBENT ALL THE SAND
OUT OF THE ENGINE ROOM.

265
00:12:01,291 --> 00:12:03,083
I THINK IT'S CLEAN.

266
00:12:03,125 --> 00:12:05,125
- IT HASN'T BEEN THAT CLEAN
SINCE IT FLOATED OFF THE
SHOWROOM FLOOR.

267
00:12:05,166 --> 00:12:06,500
- HOW'S IT GOING OUT HERE?

268
00:12:06,542 --> 00:12:08,291
- WELL, SHE'S STILL
PRETTY BANGED UP,

269
00:12:08,333 --> 00:12:10,834
BUT I THINK SHE MIGHT BE ABLE
TO LIMP OUT OF THE DESERT.

270
00:12:10,875 --> 00:12:12,709
KONG, YOU WANT TO SEE IF YOU CAN
GET THE ENGINE STARTED?

271
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:15,375
- AYE, AYE.

272
00:12:15,417 --> 00:12:19,041
[whirring]

273
00:12:19,083 --> 00:12:20,667
- ALL RIGHT!

274
00:12:20,709 --> 00:12:22,834
[rumbling]

275
00:12:22,875 --> 00:12:26,250
[all scream]

276
00:12:29,333 --> 00:12:32,166
[all panting]

277
00:12:32,208 --> 00:12:35,333
- AAH!

278
00:12:35,375 --> 00:12:37,667
THAT'S NO SPIRIT.

279
00:12:42,583 --> 00:12:43,959
I THINK IT'S GONE FOR NOW.

280
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,583
- KONG, ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

281
00:12:46,625 --> 00:12:48,083
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?

282
00:12:48,125 --> 00:12:49,542
ALL OF OUR SUPPLIES
WERE ON THE SHIP.

283
00:12:49,583 --> 00:12:51,583
WE'VE GOT NO FOOD,
NO WATER.

284
00:12:51,625 --> 00:12:54,333
- EASY, ARIK.
ANOTHER SHIP IS ON THE WAY.

285
00:12:54,375 --> 00:12:56,792
WE JUST NEED TO HOLD
OUR POSITION FOR A FEW HOURS.

286
00:12:56,834 --> 00:12:58,750
- WE MIGHT NOT HAVE
A FEW HOURS.

287
00:12:58,792 --> 00:13:00,792
- HOW FAR ARE WE
FROM THE EDGE OF THE DESERT?

288
00:13:00,834 --> 00:13:03,166
- TOO FAR TO WALK,
IF THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE THINKING.

289
00:13:03,208 --> 00:13:04,667
- WE CAN'T JUST
WAIT AROUND FOR THAT THING

290
00:13:04,709 --> 00:13:06,375
TO PICK US OFF ONE BY ONE!

291
00:13:06,417 --> 00:13:08,041
- YOU'LL DO AS YOU'RE TOLD,
AIRMAN.

292
00:13:08,083 --> 00:13:09,875
NOW GET AHOLD OF YOURSELF!

293
00:13:09,917 --> 00:13:11,291
- MAYBE WE CAN STILL
BUILD SOMETHING

294
00:13:11,333 --> 00:13:13,041
TO GET US ALL OUT OF HERE.

295
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:14,625
- YOU WANNA MAKE SOME WINGS
OUT OF SCRAP METAL

296
00:13:14,667 --> 00:13:16,083
AND FLAP REAL HARD?

297
00:13:16,125 --> 00:13:18,166
- NO, BUT WE MIGHT
HAVE ENOUGH MATERIAL

298
00:13:18,208 --> 00:13:20,458
TO CONSTRUCT
A MAKESHIFT SAND-SAILER,

299
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,875
LIKE THE SANDBENDERS
USE TO GET AROUND.

300
00:13:22,917 --> 00:13:26,583
ALL WE NEED IS A SAIL AND SOME
KIND OF SLED TO ATTACH IT TO.

301
00:13:26,625 --> 00:13:28,208
- IT'S WORTH A TRY.

302
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:31,208
- GATHER EVERY PIECE
OF METAL YOU CAN FIND.

303
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:33,750
WE'LL GIVE THAT SANDY BEAST
A RUN FOR HIS MONEY YET.

304
00:13:38,208 --> 00:13:40,959
- LOOKS LIKE HE'S IN A HURRY.
WAIT HERE.

305
00:13:55,709 --> 00:13:58,000
- YOUR MAJESTY,
WE RECEIVED A DISTRESS SIGNAL

306
00:13:58,041 --> 00:14:00,333
FROM THE AIRSHIP
CARRYING THE PRISONERS.

307
00:14:00,375 --> 00:14:02,834
WE BELIEVE THE SHIP CRASHED
IN THE SI WONG DESERT

308
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:04,709
AND THE AVATAR
MAY HAVE ESCAPED.

309
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:06,917
- THIS IS OUTRAGEOUS!

310
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:11,000
SEND ANOTHER AIRSHIP TO RETRIEVE
THE AVATAR IMMEDIATELY.

311
00:14:11,041 --> 00:14:15,166
- IT'S ALREADY ON ITS WAY,
YOUR MAJESTY.

312
00:14:15,208 --> 00:14:17,500
- WHAT ARE WE GOING
TO DO NOW?

313
00:14:17,542 --> 00:14:19,625
- THERE'S NO WAY WE CAN
TRACK HER DOWN IN THE DESERT

314
00:14:19,667 --> 00:14:21,208
BEFORE THE QUEEN GETS TO HER.

315
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:22,750
- YOU REALLY THINK
THEY'LL BE LUCKY ENOUGH

316
00:14:22,792 --> 00:14:24,375
TO CAPTURE HER AGAIN?

317
00:14:24,417 --> 00:14:26,583
SHE'LL BE LONG GONE
BY THE TIME THEY ARRIVE.

318
00:14:26,625 --> 00:14:29,375
- IT DOESN'T MATTER.
WE'RE THROUGH CHASING HER.

319
00:14:29,417 --> 00:14:32,542
IT'S TIME TO MAKE HER
COME TO US.

320
00:14:38,625 --> 00:14:42,625
- WHAT IS THIS RIFFRAFF DOING
IN MY THRONE ROOM UNANNOUNCED?

321
00:14:42,667 --> 00:14:44,458
- APOLOGIES, YOUR MAJESTY,

322
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:46,041
BUT I COULDN'T HELP
OVERHEARING

323
00:14:46,083 --> 00:14:48,000
THAT THE AVATAR WON'T BE
JOINING US TODAY.

324
00:14:48,041 --> 00:14:51,583
- THE AVATAR IS STILL
IN MY CUSTODY.

325
00:14:51,625 --> 00:14:55,250
HOWEVER, EAVESDROPPING
ON ROYAL CONVERSATIONS

326
00:14:55,291 --> 00:14:57,041
WILL LAND YOU IN A CELL

327
00:14:57,083 --> 00:14:59,709
RIGHT NEXT TO THOSE BOYS
YOU BROUGHT IN.

328
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:03,500
NOW, IF YOU VALUE
YOUR FREEDOM,

329
00:15:03,542 --> 00:15:06,667
YOU'LL TELL ME WHERE
THE AIRBENDERS ARE RIGHT NOW.

330
00:15:06,709 --> 00:15:08,166
- THAT WASN'T THE DEAL.

331
00:15:08,208 --> 00:15:10,917
- I WILL NOT BANDY WORDS
WITH BOUNTY HUNTERS.

332
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:13,792
SEIZE THESE HOODLUMS
AND THROW THEM IN PRISON

333
00:15:13,834 --> 00:15:17,875
UNTIL THEY DECIDE TO SHOW
PROPER RESPECT FOR THE CROWN!

334
00:15:19,709 --> 00:15:21,166
[both grunt]

335
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:27,083
both: OOF!

336
00:15:27,125 --> 00:15:30,000
[all grunting]

337
00:15:34,583 --> 00:15:35,291
- [whimpering]

338
00:15:35,333 --> 00:15:37,083
- GUN!

339
00:15:37,125 --> 00:15:38,333
GET BACK HERE
AND LAY DOWN YOUR LIFE

340
00:15:38,375 --> 00:15:41,834
FOR YOUR QUEEN,
YOU COWARD!

341
00:15:47,125 --> 00:15:50,125
YOU WOULDN'T DARE
ATTACK A QUEEN!

342
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:57,417
- MAYBE I FORGOT TO MENTION
SOMETHING TO YOU.

343
00:15:57,458 --> 00:16:01,750
I DON'T BELIEVE IN QUEENS.

344
00:16:06,125 --> 00:16:09,041
- [gasping]
