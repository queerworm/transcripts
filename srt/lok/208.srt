1
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:08,210
- Earth.

2
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:10,240
Fire.

3
00:00:10,853 --> 00:00:12,142
Air.

4
00:00:12,622 --> 00:00:13,671
Water.

5
00:00:14,817 --> 00:00:18,960
Only the Avatar can master
all four elements

6
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,190
And bring balance
to the world.

7
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:39,484
- Should we pull her up?

8
00:00:39,733 --> 00:00:40,693
- No.

9
00:00:40,693 --> 00:00:44,480
She is connecting with
her deepest Avatar memories.

10
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:46,391
She must confront
her own past

11
00:00:46,391 --> 00:00:48,950
If she is
to move forward.

12
00:00:49,235 --> 00:00:54,990
We can only hope
that she survives her ordeal.

13
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:57,795
- The human and spirit realms
are headed

14
00:00:57,795 --> 00:00:59,600
Toward annihilation.

15
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,330
And it's all your fault.

16
00:01:02,330 --> 00:01:04,933
This is why
humans have no place

17
00:01:04,933 --> 00:01:07,470
Interfering in the business
of spirits.

18
00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:09,555
- This world is home
to all of us,

19
00:01:09,550 --> 00:01:12,124
And what happens here is
everyone's business.

20
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:13,093
- Thanks to you,

21
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:15,413
This world may cease
to exist!

22
00:01:15,410 --> 00:01:17,777
I only hope
I can track down Vaatu

23
00:01:17,770 --> 00:01:19,288
Before it's too late.

24
00:01:19,288 --> 00:01:20,720
- Let me help you.

25
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,320
- I don't want your help.

26
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:27,190
Don't interfere with me
again, human!

27
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:30,030
- Let's get moving.

28
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:39,800
[Mula growls]

29
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,510
Do you see that, Mula?

30
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:52,620
People.

31
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:55,620
And they have some kind
of wind power.

32
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:57,050
[Mula growls]

33
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:59,420
[laughs]
more humans!

34
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:00,520
I found you.

35
00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:01,190
- Aah!

36
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:03,790
- Wait! I'm friendly!

37
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:12,100
[shouts]

38
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:16,470
[breathing heavily]

39
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:19,180
[grunting, panting]

40
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:20,440
Huh?

41
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:31,250
[birds chirping]

42
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:33,290
The legends are true.

43
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:35,490
Another Lion Turtle city.

44
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:39,100
And it's flying.

45
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,230
I have got to get over there.

46
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:53,740
There.

47
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:55,550
Okay, Mula.

48
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:58,680
Wish me luck.

49
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:03,090
[screams]

50
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:05,390
Oh, no--

51
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:07,820
[panting]

52
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:20,070
Wow.

53
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:23,110
Hi, how are you?

54
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:24,210
I'm Wan.

55
00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:27,740
I'm sorry to interrupt,
but it's been a while

56
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:29,110
Since I've seen other humans.

57
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:31,650
- Where did you come from,
stranger?

58
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:33,780
- Another Lion Turtle city
far away.

59
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:37,420
For the past two years I've
been living among the spirits

60
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:38,450
And exploring the wilds.

61
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:42,090
- Remarkable.
Come. Sit with us.

62
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:46,560
We would love to hear
of your travels.

63
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,360
- [gasps]

64
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:55,200
[both screaming]

65
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:57,740
[laughter]

66
00:03:57,740 --> 00:03:59,880
- [exclaims]

67
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:00,940
- [shouting]

68
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:04,380
[all yelling]

69
00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:10,320
- Vaatu.

70
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:14,260
- So we meet again, human.

71
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:17,590
- Why is the great spirit
of darkness here

72
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,830
But not his other half?

73
00:04:18,830 --> 00:04:22,570
- Uh, I'll explain later.

74
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:24,930
Leave these people in peace.

75
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:28,170
They've done nothing
to harm you.

76
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:31,210
- [gasps]

77
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:34,480
[whimpers]

78
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:54,500
- Be gone.

79
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,470
[crash]

80
00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:06,140
- How are you feeling
since our split, Raava?

81
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:09,680
I've never been better.

82
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:12,080
When harmonic convergence comes,

83
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:18,290
I will destroy you forever.

84
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:22,130
- [sighs]
- I told you not to interfere.

85
00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:23,360
- I had to do something.

86
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,860
These people were in danger.

87
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:26,660
- Great spirit of light,

88
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:28,100
We thank you for your help.

89
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:32,200
But how did you become split
from Vaatu?

90
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:36,140
- Ask him.

91
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:37,010
- It wasn't my fault.

92
00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:39,010
Vaatu tricked me
into freeing him.

93
00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:40,810
I'd take it all back
if I could.

94
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:42,480
- It's too late for that.

95
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:44,180
Now that Vaatu is free,

96
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:47,080
He is turning
other spirits dark.

97
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:49,590
The more spirits he turns,

98
00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:51,890
The stronger he becomes.

99
00:05:51,890 --> 00:05:53,220
- He's getting bigger,

100
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:55,160
And you're getting smaller.

101
00:05:55,160 --> 00:06:00,530
- As darkness grows,
light fades.

102
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,070
- I'm sorry for endangering
your village,

103
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:08,570
But I promise
to set things right.

104
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:10,640
- How?

105
00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:12,980
- Great Lion Turtle,

106
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:14,480
I ask that you grant me
the power of air

107
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:17,180
So that I can defeat Vaatu
before it's too late.

108
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:21,450
- You already carry
the power of fire.

109
00:06:21,450 --> 00:06:28,060
No human has ever held
two elements at the same time.

110
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:29,830
- I'm not like other humans.

111
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:31,590
I can learn to do it.

112
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,930
- Hmm, perhaps.

113
00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:38,700
But to do so, Raava
must hold the power for you

114
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:40,240
Until you master it.

115
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:44,210
- Ancient one, why would I
do that for a human?

116
00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:46,840
Especially one who's caused
so much trouble?

117
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:50,880
- Raava, please, I can't let
the world fall into chaos

118
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,450
Because of my mistake.

119
00:06:52,450 --> 00:06:54,420
Neither of us
can defeat Vaatu alone,

120
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:56,490
But together we have a chance.

121
00:06:56,490 --> 00:06:58,590
- You may be right.

122
00:06:58,590 --> 00:06:59,820
Very well.

123
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:03,330
I will help you to master
the power of air.

124
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:07,160
- Thank you.
And in return I will help you

125
00:07:07,170 --> 00:07:09,700
Restore balance
to the world.

126
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:16,710
- What's this harmonic thing
Vaatu was talking about?

127
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:18,640
- Harmonic convergence.

128
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:19,480
That is when Vaatu and I

129
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,540
Must battle
for the fate of the world.

130
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:23,850
- How long do we have
until then?

131
00:07:23,850 --> 00:07:25,920
- About a year
in your time.

132
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:29,590
- Then we better start training.

133
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:35,260
All right,
I'm ready to try air.

134
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:36,290
How's this gonna work?

135
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:38,330
- The only way for me
to give you

136
00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:39,630
The other element
is to pass

137
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:42,570
Through your body
and combine our energies.

138
00:07:42,570 --> 00:07:44,100
- Great.
So you've done this before.

139
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:48,240
- No. This has never
even been attempted.

140
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,570
It is very dangerous.

141
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:52,480
- That's what they said about
living in the spirit wilds,

142
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:54,210
And I survived that.

143
00:07:54,210 --> 00:07:57,780
I'm ready.
Give me the air.

144
00:08:00,050 --> 00:08:02,320
[shouts]

145
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:11,930
It feels completely different.

146
00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:16,070
If you and Vaatu have the same
fight every 10,000 years,

147
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:18,030
Why hasn't one of you
destroyed the other?

148
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:20,870
- He cannot destroy light
any more

149
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:22,040
Than I can destroy darkness.

150
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:25,140
One cannot exist
without the other.

151
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:28,540
Even if I defeat Vaatu
in this encounter,

152
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:32,720
Darkness will grow inside me
until he emerges again.

153
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:36,620
The same will hold true
if Vaatu defeats me.

154
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:37,750
- That doesn't sound so bad.

155
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,260
Even if Vaatu wins,
you'll come back.

156
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:43,060
- Yes, but you will
probably not survive to see it.

157
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:45,760
Vaatu will destroy the world
as you know it.

158
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:50,170
Darkness will cover the earth
for 10,000 years.

159
00:08:50,170 --> 00:08:52,800
- If I'm gonna help you
battle Vaatu,

160
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:56,010
Then I should visit
more Lion Turtles.

161
00:08:56,010 --> 00:08:57,970
Why is there so much conflict

162
00:08:57,980 --> 00:09:00,480
Between humans and spirits
in the first place?

163
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:04,080
- This physical world
is where humans come from.

164
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,720
Spirits come from another realm.

165
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:09,050
At the north and south poles,

166
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:11,220
The two realms intersect.

167
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:13,620
Over time,
more and more spirits

168
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:17,060
Have drifted
into this world.

169
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:19,200
Humans have been forced apart,

170
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:22,060
Settling on the Lion Turtles
who protect them

171
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:24,970
And losing touch
with each other.

172
00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:26,040
- Most people think they live

173
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,340
In the only human city
in the world.

174
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:29,810
- Most humans
think only of themselves,

175
00:09:29,810 --> 00:09:32,840
No matter
how many others are around.

176
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:35,010
- When you pass through me,

177
00:09:35,010 --> 00:09:38,380
I feel an incredible rush
of power.

178
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:41,780
[grunting]

179
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:49,060
I feel like I'm changing.

180
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:52,030
The more we practice,
the stronger I become.

181
00:09:52,030 --> 00:09:54,060
[sniffs]

182
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:56,270
Smells like smoke.

183
00:09:56,270 --> 00:09:57,900
