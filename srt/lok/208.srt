1
00:00:08,041 --> 00:00:09,000
- EARTH.

2
00:00:09,041 --> 00:00:11,000
FIRE.

3
00:00:11,041 --> 00:00:12,667
AIR.

4
00:00:12,709 --> 00:00:14,834
WATER.

5
00:00:14,875 --> 00:00:18,750
ONLY THE AVATAR CAN MASTER
ALL FOUR ELEMENTS

6
00:00:18,792 --> 00:00:21,542
AND BRING BALANCE
TO THE WORLD.

7
00:00:27,667 --> 00:00:29,542
- AVATAR KORRA
HAS LOST HER MEMORY!

8
00:00:29,583 --> 00:00:32,166
IN ORDER TO RESTORE IT,
SHE HAS CONNECTED WITH WAN,

9
00:00:32,208 --> 00:00:34,375
WHO WOULD BECOME
THE VERY FIRST AVATAR.

10
00:00:34,417 --> 00:00:35,917
BANISHED FROM HIS HOME,
WAN SURVIVED

11
00:00:35,959 --> 00:00:37,291
FOR TWO YEARS
IN THE SPIRIT WILDS

12
00:00:37,333 --> 00:00:38,875
AND LEARNED
TO MASTER FIRE.

13
00:00:38,917 --> 00:00:40,333
BUT THEN,
WAN SPLIT THE SPIRITS

14
00:00:40,375 --> 00:00:42,750
OF LIGHT AND DARK,
RAAVA AND VAATU,

15
00:00:42,792 --> 00:00:45,166
UNWITTINGLY PLUNGING THE WORLD
TOWARD ANNIHILATION.

16
00:00:45,208 --> 00:00:47,291
WILL HE BE ABLE TO STOP IT?

17
00:00:57,834 --> 00:01:00,333
- SHOULD WE PULL HER UP?

18
00:01:00,375 --> 00:01:01,709
- NO.

19
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:04,959
SHE IS CONNECTING WITH
HER DEEPEST AVATAR MEMORIES.

20
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,041
SHE MUST CONFRONT
HER OWN PAST

21
00:01:07,083 --> 00:01:09,542
IF SHE IS
TO MOVE FORWARD.

22
00:01:09,583 --> 00:01:15,583
WE CAN ONLY HOPE
THAT SHE SURVIVES HER ORDEAL.

23
00:01:15,625 --> 00:01:18,125
- THE HUMAN AND SPIRIT REALMS
ARE HEADED

24
00:01:18,166 --> 00:01:19,875
TOWARD ANNIHILATION.

25
00:01:19,917 --> 00:01:22,834
AND IT'S ALL YOUR FAULT.

26
00:01:22,875 --> 00:01:25,500
THIS IS WHY
HUMANS HAVE NO PLACE

27
00:01:25,542 --> 00:01:28,041
INTERFERING IN THE BUSINESS
OF SPIRITS.

28
00:01:28,083 --> 00:01:29,917
- THIS WORLD IS HOME
TO ALL OF US,

29
00:01:29,959 --> 00:01:32,375
AND WHAT HAPPENS HERE IS
EVERYONE'S BUSINESS.

30
00:01:32,417 --> 00:01:33,500
- THANKS TO YOU,

31
00:01:33,542 --> 00:01:35,709
THIS WORLD MAY CEASE
TO EXIST!

32
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:38,000
I ONLY HOPE
I CAN TRACK DOWN VAATU

33
00:01:38,041 --> 00:01:39,375
BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.

34
00:01:39,417 --> 00:01:40,834
- LET ME HELP YOU.

35
00:01:40,875 --> 00:01:42,667
- I DON'T WANT YOUR HELP.

36
00:01:42,709 --> 00:01:46,250
DON'T INTERFERE WITH ME
AGAIN, HUMAN!

37
00:01:47,917 --> 00:01:49,291
- LET'S GET MOVING.

38
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:59,125
[Mula growls]

39
00:02:10,125 --> 00:02:11,250
DO YOU SEE THAT, MULA?

40
00:02:11,291 --> 00:02:13,166
PEOPLE.

41
00:02:13,208 --> 00:02:15,583
AND THEY HAVE SOME KIND
OF WIND POWER.

42
00:02:15,625 --> 00:02:16,291
[Mula growls]

43
00:02:17,625 --> 00:02:19,291
[laughs]
MORE HUMANS!

44
00:02:19,333 --> 00:02:20,291
I FOUND YOU.

45
00:02:20,333 --> 00:02:21,291
- AAH!

46
00:02:21,333 --> 00:02:23,208
- WAIT! I'M FRIENDLY!

47
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:31,333
[shouts]

48
00:02:34,125 --> 00:02:36,500
[breathing heavily]

49
00:02:36,542 --> 00:02:38,792
[grunting, panting]

50
00:02:38,834 --> 00:02:39,750
HUH?

51
00:02:48,667 --> 00:02:51,250
[birds chirping]

52
00:02:51,291 --> 00:02:53,375
THE LEGENDS ARE TRUE.

53
00:02:53,417 --> 00:02:55,458
ANOTHER LION TURTLE CITY.

54
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:58,375
AND IT'S FLYING.

55
00:03:02,709 --> 00:03:04,542
I HAVE GOT TO GET OVER THERE.

56
00:03:11,166 --> 00:03:13,709
THERE.

57
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:15,500
OKAY, MULA.

58
00:03:15,542 --> 00:03:18,083
WISH ME LUCK.

59
00:03:20,875 --> 00:03:22,750
[screams]

60
00:03:22,792 --> 00:03:25,250
OH, NO--

61
00:03:25,291 --> 00:03:27,291
[panting]

62
00:03:37,667 --> 00:03:39,333
WOW.

63
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:42,834
HI, HOW ARE YOU?

64
00:03:42,875 --> 00:03:45,000
I'M WAN.

65
00:03:45,041 --> 00:03:48,166
I'M SORRY TO INTERRUPT,
BUT IT'S BEEN A WHILE

66
00:03:48,208 --> 00:03:49,583
SINCE I'VE SEEN OTHER HUMANS.

67
00:03:49,625 --> 00:03:52,250
- WHERE DID YOU COME FROM,
STRANGER?

68
00:03:52,291 --> 00:03:54,959
- ANOTHER LION TURTLE CITY
FAR AWAY.

69
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,458
FOR THE PAST TWO YEARS I'VE
BEEN LIVING AMONG THE SPIRITS

70
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:58,917
AND EXPLORING THE WILDS.

71
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:02,625
- REMARKABLE.
COME. SIT WITH US.

72
00:04:02,667 --> 00:04:06,542
WE WOULD LOVE TO HEAR
OF YOUR TRAVELS.

73
00:04:06,583 --> 00:04:07,792
- [gasps]

74
00:04:12,083 --> 00:04:15,041
[both screaming]

75
00:04:15,083 --> 00:04:17,750
[laughter]

76
00:04:17,792 --> 00:04:19,917
- [exclaims]

77
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:21,041
- [shouting]

78
00:04:21,083 --> 00:04:23,750
[all yelling]

79
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:30,500
- VAATU.

80
00:04:30,542 --> 00:04:34,834
- SO WE MEET AGAIN, HUMAN.

81
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:37,709
- WHY IS THE GREAT SPIRIT
OF DARKNESS HERE

82
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:39,208
BUT NOT HIS OTHER HALF?

83
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:42,875
- UH, I'LL EXPLAIN LATER.

84
00:04:42,917 --> 00:04:45,709
LEAVE THESE PEOPLE IN PEACE.

85
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:47,500
THEY'VE DONE NOTHING
TO HARM YOU.

86
00:04:49,667 --> 00:04:51,041
- [gasps]

87
00:04:51,083 --> 00:04:53,875
[whimpers]

88
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:13,959
- BE GONE.

89
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:17,917
[crash]

90
00:05:21,917 --> 00:05:26,333
- HOW ARE YOU FEELING
SINCE OUR SPLIT, RAAVA?

91
00:05:26,375 --> 00:05:30,083
I'VE NEVER BEEN BETTER.

92
00:05:30,125 --> 00:05:32,333
WHEN HARMONIC CONVERGENCE COMES,

93
00:05:32,375 --> 00:05:37,709
I WILL DESTROY YOU FOREVER.

94
00:05:39,291 --> 00:05:42,208
- [sighs]
- I TOLD YOU NOT TO INTERFERE.

95
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:43,667
- I HAD TO DO SOMETHING.

96
00:05:43,709 --> 00:05:45,125
THESE PEOPLE WERE IN DANGER.

97
00:05:45,166 --> 00:05:47,041
- GREAT SPIRIT OF LIGHT,

98
00:05:47,083 --> 00:05:48,750
WE THANK YOU FOR YOUR HELP.

99
00:05:48,792 --> 00:05:52,083
BUT HOW DID YOU BECOME SPLIT
FROM VAATU?

100
00:05:52,125 --> 00:05:56,291
- ASK HIM.

101
00:05:56,333 --> 00:05:57,417
- IT WASN'T MY FAULT.

102
00:05:57,458 --> 00:05:59,750
VAATU TRICKED ME
INTO FREEING HIM.

103
00:05:59,792 --> 00:06:01,291
I'D TAKE IT ALL BACK
IF I COULD.

104
00:06:01,333 --> 00:06:02,667
- IT'S TOO LATE FOR THAT.

105
00:06:02,709 --> 00:06:04,750
NOW THAT VAATU IS FREE,

106
00:06:04,792 --> 00:06:07,333
HE IS TURNING
OTHER SPIRITS DARK.

107
00:06:07,375 --> 00:06:09,834
THE MORE SPIRITS HE TURNS,

108
00:06:09,875 --> 00:06:12,375
THE STRONGER HE BECOMES.

109
00:06:12,417 --> 00:06:13,625
- HE'S GETTING BIGGER,

110
00:06:13,667 --> 00:06:15,709
AND YOU'RE GETTING SMALLER.

111
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:20,041
- AS DARKNESS GROWS,
LIGHT FADES.

112
00:06:22,583 --> 00:06:24,625
- I'M SORRY FOR ENDANGERING
YOUR VILLAGE,

113
00:06:24,667 --> 00:06:28,500
BUT I PROMISE
TO SET THINGS RIGHT.

114
00:06:28,542 --> 00:06:30,166
- HOW?

115
00:06:31,625 --> 00:06:33,709
- GREAT LION TURTLE,

116
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:35,500
I ASK THAT YOU GRANT ME
THE POWER OF AIR

117
00:06:35,542 --> 00:06:37,834
SO THAT I CAN DEFEAT VAATU
BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.

118
00:06:37,875 --> 00:06:42,458
- YOU ALREADY CARRY
THE POWER OF FIRE.

119
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:48,417
NO HUMAN HAS EVER HELD
TWO ELEMENTS AT THE SAME TIME.

120
00:06:48,458 --> 00:06:50,166
- I'M NOT LIKE OTHER HUMANS.

121
00:06:50,208 --> 00:06:51,667
I CAN LEARN TO DO IT.

122
00:06:51,709 --> 00:06:55,000
- HMM, PERHAPS.

123
00:06:55,041 --> 00:06:58,959
BUT TO DO SO, RAAVA
MUST HOLD THE POWER FOR YOU

124
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,166
UNTIL YOU MASTER IT.

125
00:07:01,208 --> 00:07:05,083
- ANCIENT ONE, WHY WOULD I
DO THAT FOR A HUMAN?

126
00:07:05,125 --> 00:07:08,208
ESPECIALLY ONE WHO'S CAUSED
SO MUCH TROUBLE?

127
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:11,291
- RAAVA, PLEASE, I CAN'T LET
THE WORLD FALL INTO CHAOS

128
00:07:11,333 --> 00:07:13,166
BECAUSE OF MY MISTAKE.

129
00:07:13,208 --> 00:07:14,875
NEITHER OF US
CAN DEFEAT VAATU ALONE,

130
00:07:14,917 --> 00:07:16,750
BUT TOGETHER WE HAVE A CHANCE.

131
00:07:16,792 --> 00:07:18,667
- YOU MAY BE RIGHT.

132
00:07:18,709 --> 00:07:20,834
VERY WELL.

133
00:07:20,875 --> 00:07:24,166
I WILL HELP YOU TO MASTER
THE POWER OF AIR.

134
00:07:24,208 --> 00:07:27,625
- THANK YOU.
AND IN RETURN I WILL HELP YOU

135
00:07:27,667 --> 00:07:29,291
RESTORE BALANCE
TO THE WORLD.

136
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:37,291
- WHAT'S THIS HARMONIC THING
VAATU WAS TALKING ABOUT?

137
00:07:37,333 --> 00:07:39,208
- HARMONIC CONVERGENCE.

138
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:40,792
THAT IS WHEN VAATU AND I

139
00:07:40,834 --> 00:07:42,792
MUST BATTLE
FOR THE FATE OF THE WORLD.

140
00:07:42,834 --> 00:07:44,792
- HOW LONG DO WE HAVE
UNTIL THEN?

141
00:07:44,834 --> 00:07:46,709
- ABOUT A YEAR
IN YOUR TIME.

142
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:49,417
- THEN WE BETTER START TRAINING.

143
00:07:54,375 --> 00:07:56,083
ALL RIGHT,
I'M READY TO TRY AIR.

144
00:07:56,125 --> 00:07:57,458
HOW'S THIS GONNA WORK?

145
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:59,375
- THE ONLY WAY FOR ME
TO GIVE YOU

146
00:07:59,417 --> 00:08:00,917
THE OTHER ELEMENT
IS TO PASS

147
00:08:00,959 --> 00:08:03,667
THROUGH YOUR BODY
AND COMBINE OUR ENERGIES.

148
00:08:03,709 --> 00:08:05,417
- GREAT.
SO YOU'VE DONE THIS BEFORE.

149
00:08:05,458 --> 00:08:09,041
- NO. THIS HAS NEVER
EVEN BEEN ATTEMPTED.

150
00:08:09,083 --> 00:08:11,208
IT IS VERY DANGEROUS.

151
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:13,333
- THAT'S WHAT THEY SAID ABOUT
LIVING IN THE SPIRIT WILDS,

152
00:08:13,375 --> 00:08:15,291
AND I SURVIVED THAT.

153
00:08:15,333 --> 00:08:17,750
I'M READY.
GIVE ME THE AIR.

154
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,417
[shouts]

155
00:08:30,709 --> 00:08:33,542
IT FEELS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT.

156
00:08:33,583 --> 00:08:37,500
IF YOU AND VAATU HAVE THE SAME
FIGHT EVERY 10,000 YEARS,

157
00:08:37,542 --> 00:08:39,125
WHY HASN'T ONE OF YOU
DESTROYED THE OTHER?

158
00:08:39,166 --> 00:08:41,709
- HE CANNOT DESTROY LIGHT
ANY MORE

159
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:43,125
THAN I CAN DESTROY DARKNESS.

160
00:08:43,166 --> 00:08:46,458
ONE CANNOT EXIST
WITHOUT THE OTHER.

161
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:50,125
EVEN IF I DEFEAT VAATU
IN THIS ENCOUNTER,

162
00:08:50,166 --> 00:08:53,959
DARKNESS WILL GROW INSIDE ME
UNTIL HE EMERGES AGAIN.

163
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,542
THE SAME WILL HOLD TRUE
IF VAATU DEFEATS ME.

164
00:08:57,583 --> 00:08:59,041
- THAT DOESN'T SOUND SO BAD.

165
00:08:59,083 --> 00:09:00,875
EVEN IF VAATU WINS,
YOU'LL COME BACK.

166
00:09:00,917 --> 00:09:04,458
- YES, BUT YOU WILL
PROBABLY NOT SURVIVE TO SEE IT.

167
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:07,250
VAATU WILL DESTROY THE WORLD
AS YOU KNOW IT.

168
00:09:07,291 --> 00:09:11,500
DARKNESS WILL COVER THE EARTH
FOR 10,000 YEARS.

169
00:09:11,542 --> 00:09:14,041
- IF I'M GONNA HELP YOU
BATTLE VAATU,

170
00:09:14,083 --> 00:09:16,959
THEN I SHOULD VISIT
MORE LION TURTLES.

171
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,417
WHY IS THERE SO MUCH CONFLICT

172
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:22,083
BETWEEN HUMANS AND SPIRITS
IN THE FIRST PLACE?

173
00:09:22,125 --> 00:09:25,000
- THIS PHYSICAL WORLD
IS WHERE HUMANS COME FROM.

174
00:09:25,041 --> 00:09:27,583
SPIRITS COME FROM ANOTHER REALM.

175
00:09:27,625 --> 00:09:29,917
AT THE NORTH AND SOUTH POLES,

176
00:09:29,959 --> 00:09:32,417
THE TWO REALMS INTERSECT.

177
00:09:32,458 --> 00:09:34,500
OVER TIME,
MORE AND MORE SPIRITS

178
00:09:34,542 --> 00:09:38,041
HAVE DRIFTED
INTO THIS WORLD.

179
00:09:38,083 --> 00:09:40,583

00:22:40,625 --> 00:22:43,166
I'M THE AVATAR.

356
00:22:44,917 --> 00:22:47,417
- WE'VE BEEN RAISING
THIS HERD OF AIR BISON

357
00:22:47,458 --> 00:22:50,375
SINCE THE HUNDRED YEAR WAR.

358
00:22:50,417 --> 00:22:54,750
I NEVER THOUGHT I'D BE ABLE
TO PRESENT ONE TO THE AVATAR.

359
00:22:54,792 --> 00:22:57,125
- THANK YOU
FOR ALL YOUR KINDNESS.

360
00:22:57,166 --> 00:22:59,208
I WONDER HOW LONG
I'VE BEEN AWAY.

361
00:22:59,250 --> 00:23:01,458
- THAT I CANNOT SAY,

362
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:03,959
BUT YOU DO NOT HAVE
MUCH TIME LEFT.

363
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,917
THE HARMONIC CONVERGENCE
IS ONLY WEEKS AWAY.

364
00:23:07,959 --> 00:23:09,500
- I HAVE TO CLOSE
THE SPIRIT PORTAL

365
00:23:09,542 --> 00:23:12,291
BEFORE THAT HAPPENS.
