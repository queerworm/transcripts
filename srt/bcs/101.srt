Yeah. Yeah.

401
00:15:37,729 --> 00:15:39,606
He's certainly

402
00:15:37,729 --> 00:15:39,606
not guilty of some--

403
00:15:39,606 --> 00:15:43,025
Certainly not.

404
00:15:39,606 --> 00:15:43,025
He's innocent of any wrongdoing,

405
00:15:43,025 --> 00:15:44,861

It's a discrepancy, absolutely.
