Just like in Arizona...

62

is its own entity.

385
00:36:24,015 --> 00:36:26,684
...it was like the inside
of a Jiffy Pop wrapper, all right?

because of the Mesa Verde event and so...

-Ernie told you?

He said Chuck has a tape recorder wrapped
in a space blanket in his desk drawer.

404
00:37:16,359 --> 00:37:18,194
Ernie was putting new batteries in it...

405

...and the tape rolled for a few seconds
and he heard you.

Oh, yeah? What'd he say?

454
00:40:19,959 --> 00:40:21,001
Well, as we know...

455
00:40:21,168 --> 00:40:25,005
...New Mexico is one-party consent,
so Chuck had a right to make the recording.

456
00:40:25,172 --> 00:40:28,551
But you went to him worried
for his mental health.

457
00:40:29,218 --> 00:40:31,887
You said the things you did
to make him feel better...

458
00:40:32,054 --> 00:40:35,349
...which mitigates the admission of guilt,
at the very least.

459
00:40:36,767 --> 00:40:38,727
We can poke holes in the custody...

460

...throw doubt the voice
on the tape is even yours.

461
00:40:41,772 --> 00:40:45,568

doesn't outweigh how prejudicial it is.

I think we can get the whole thing
bounced under 403.

Probably get it excluded outright.

464
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:54,910
So then...

465
00:40:55,786 --> 00:40:58,205
...outside the courts, what can he do?

466
00:40:59,415 --> 00:41:02,251

467
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:05,379

I'd have heard something, for sure.
