00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:08,991
-Why? What happened?
-I don't....

183
00:15:11,118 --> 00:15:13,078
It doesn't matter.

184
00:15:13,621 --> 00:15:15,164
I just....

185
00:15:15,331 --> 00:15:16,415
Is Jimmy okay?

186
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:19,209
I feel bad, like it's my fault.

187
00:15:19,376 --> 00:15:22,880
-I didn't mean for this to happen.
-What happened to Jimmy?

188
00:15:37,144 --> 00:15:39,146
[FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING]

189
00:15:40,814 --> 00:15:43,317
MAN: McGill.
-Yeah.

190
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:51,784
You're up.

191
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:13,389
JUDGE:
We've got CR-2003113081.

192
00:16:17,434 --> 00:16:18,519
James McGill.

193
00:16:18,686 --> 00:16:20,062
JIMMY:
Yes, Your Honor.

194
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:23,315
Not how I'm used to
seeing you in here, Mr. McGill.

195
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:26,318
-Not how I'd like to be seen.
-Wow.

196
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:28,737
You had quite the day yesterday.

197
00:16:28,904 --> 00:16:31,073
Okay, Mr. McGill.

198
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:34,451
You've been accused of fourth degree
felony breaking and entering...

199
00:16:34,618 --> 00:16:37,287
...which carries
a maximum sentence of 18 months...

200
00:16:37,454 --> 00:16:39,540
...and a $5000 fine.

201
00:16:39,707 --> 00:16:41,917
We've also got
petty misdemeanor assault.

202
00:16:42,334 --> 00:16:45,921
Maximum six months jail time
and a $500 fine.

203
00:16:46,088 --> 00:16:48,424
Plus, criminal damage to property.

204
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:53,095
Also misdemeanor with a maximum
sentence of six months and a $500 fine.

205
00:16:53,262 --> 00:16:54,388
Victim is...

206
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:58,851
...your brother, Charles. Seriously?

207
00:17:00,769 --> 00:17:03,522
I assume you're prepared
to enter a plea at this time.

208
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:08,736
Yes, Your Honor.
I wish to enter a plea of not guilty.

209
00:17:08,944 --> 00:17:12,281
The court accepts and enters
the defendant's plea of not guilty.

210
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:15,075
Now, Mr. McGill,
have you secured counsel?

211
00:17:15,242 --> 00:17:18,996
Yes, Your Honor. Kim Wexler, I'll be
representing Mr. McGill in this matter.

212
00:17:19,163 --> 00:17:22,458
Just in time. Let's enter Ms. Wexler
as the attorney of record--

213
00:17:22,624 --> 00:17:26,837
Your Honor, if I may,
I'll be representing myself.

214
00:17:27,004 --> 00:17:30,007
I strongly advise against that,
Mr. McGill.

215
00:17:30,174 --> 00:17:32,384
You know what they say
about a man who represents--

216
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:34,344
I'm-- I'm aware, but, as you know...

217
00:17:34,511 --> 00:17:36,472
...I've defended many people
in the system.

218
00:17:36,638 --> 00:17:38,932
Your Honor, may I have a moment
with my client?

219
00:17:39,099 --> 00:17:41,060
Sounds like he's not your client.

220
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:46,899
Mr. McGill, would you like to
take a moment to discuss this with your...

221
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:48,358
...potential counsel?

222
00:17:50,444 --> 00:17:53,781
No, Your Honor, I'm all set.
I'm gonna represent myself.

223
00:17:53,947 --> 00:17:55,866
-Your Honor.
-Not your client, Ms. Wexler.

224
00:17:56,033 --> 00:17:58,911
Sorry, moving on. You two
can work this out on your own time.

225
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:02,206
I was gonna call you,
but then I thought I'd tell you in person.

226
00:18:02,372 --> 00:18:03,916
JUDGE:
Mr. McGill.

227
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:07,461
So on to the issue of bond.

228
00:18:09,171 --> 00:18:12,424
You have no priors
and no outstanding warrants.

229
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:14,885
And where are
you currently practicing law?

230
00:18:15,052 --> 00:18:17,221
I haven't seen you
in my court in a while.

231
00:18:17,971 --> 00:18:19,890
Elder law.

232
00:18:20,057 --> 00:18:21,558
What a noble pursuit.

233
00:18:21,725 --> 00:18:24,019
One I hope you get back to very soon.

234
00:18:24,186 --> 00:18:27,272
Given your ties to the community,
I see no reason to deny you bond.

235
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:31,110
Which I set now at $2500.

236
00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:00,639
I fucked up.

237
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:08,272
Chuck bamboozled me again.

238
00:19:08,438 --> 00:19:11,275
That tape? He made sure that
Ernie heard it, right?

239
00:19:11,441 --> 00:19:14,153
Because he knew Ernie, bless him,
would tell me about it...

240
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:17,281
...and I'd come over,
try to destroy it or steal it or whatever.

241
00:19:17,447 --> 00:19:20,909
Howard was there, and a PI.
If you can believe that.

242
00:19:21,076 --> 00:19:24,246
Just waiting for me to lose my shit
and bust in.

243
00:19:24,413 --> 00:19:29,501
Chuck played me like a fiddle,
and schmuck that I am, I fell for it.

244
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:31,336
Moron.

245
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:33,714
I'm sorry.

246
00:19:33,881 --> 00:19:36,925
Then I didn't call you, which is stupid,
and sorry about that too.

247
00:19:37,092 --> 00:19:41,138
But I didn't call you for a reason, okay?
Because this is my screw-up.

248
00:19:41,305 --> 00:19:43,432
I own it, okay?

249
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:45,684
It's my responsibility to fix it.

250
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:49,396
And I know you wanna help, of course
you do, 'cause you're wonderful.

251
00:19:49,563 --> 00:19:50,898
But...

252
00:19:51,064 --> 00:19:57,154
...you're up to your ears in Mesa Verde,
and I can't, I won't, load this onto you too.

253
00:19:57,321 --> 00:20:01,283
We have worked too hard
to let Chuck's bullshit vendetta...

254
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:03,285
...threaten everything we're building.

255
00:20:03,452 --> 00:20:07,122
I won't allow him
to endanger our business, no.

256
00:20:07,289 --> 00:20:11,835
I will fix this.
Myself, me, Jimmy McGill, okay?

257
00:20:12,002 --> 00:20:14,963
You have gotta let me do this
on my own.

258
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:21,178
Okay.

259
00:20:27,434 --> 00:20:29,061
Thank you.

260
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:48,872
I, um-- I finished it.

261
00:20:49,373 --> 00:20:52,709
I-- I mean, I just touched up the edges...

262
00:20:52,876 --> 00:20:54,461
...a little.

263
00:20:55,045 --> 00:20:57,714
Is-- Is that okay?

264
00:20:59,216 --> 00:21:00,717
Oh....

265
00:21:01,134 --> 00:21:03,428
Uh, sure.

266
00:21:04,221 --> 00:21:06,223
It looks nice.

267
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:11,645
You mind driving me to my car?

268
00:21:11,812 --> 00:21:14,147
Sure, no problem.

269
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:17,484
Um....

270
00:21:17,693 --> 00:21:19,194
Just so you know...

271
00:21:19,361 --> 00:21:22,823
...this isn't a typical week around here.

272
00:21:23,657 --> 00:21:25,993
Yeah, totally.

273
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:28,537
I didn't think that it was.

274
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:57,232
[IN SPANISH]
Good.

275
00:21:58,859 --> 00:22:00,193
Aah.

276
00:22:00,402 --> 00:22:01,695
Very good.

277
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:05,824
Uh-huh.

278
00:22:07,117 --> 00:22:09,119
How long has he had the fever?

279
00:22:09,286 --> 00:22:10,537
[IN SPANISH]
Three days.

280
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:14,291
Good.

281
00:22:14,458 --> 00:22:16,710
Heart and lungs sound good.

282
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:19,463
No redness in his throat.

283
00:22:20,297 --> 00:22:23,425
So I don't think it's strep.

284
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:32,976
You think if we ask mama nicely...

285
00:22:33,518 --> 00:22:36,396
...she'll let you have this?

286
00:22:36,563 --> 00:22:38,023
-Hm?
-Yes.

287
00:22:39,066 --> 00:22:41,068
Very good. Bye.

288
00:22:45,572 --> 00:22:46,823
What's left?

289
00:22:47,491 --> 00:22:52,996
[IN SPANISH] Some stomach cramps,
sinus infection, and a possible ankle sprain.

290
00:22:54,081 --> 00:22:55,749
What about the gringo?

291
00:22:56,708 --> 00:22:58,210
The revenge.

292
00:23:00,253 --> 00:23:01,880
I'll take him next.

293
00:23:04,424 --> 00:23:06,176
[IN ENGLISH]
Mr. Clark.

294
00:23:06,343 --> 00:23:08,553
The doctor's ready.

295
00:23:13,266 --> 00:23:15,477
DOCTOR [IN ENGLISH]: <i>And how</i>
<i>may I help you today, Mr. Clark?</i>

296
00:23:15,685 --> 00:23:18,855
I believe
our mutual acquaintance called ahead.

297
00:23:19,022 --> 00:23:20,357
He told me what...

298
00:23:20,524 --> 00:23:22,150
-...but not how much.
-Mm.

299
00:23:22,317 --> 00:23:25,112
Well, I need a package...

300
00:23:25,278 --> 00:23:27,072
...yea big.

301
00:23:28,281 --> 00:23:30,242
And what's that in grams?

302
00:23:31,618 --> 00:23:34,121
I don't know. This big.

303
00:25:13,428 --> 00:25:14,971
Hey.

304
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:16,932
Hey.

305
00:25:17,098 --> 00:25:18,767
Is somebody sitting here?

306
00:25:18,934 --> 00:25:20,518
No.

307
00:25:26,983 --> 00:25:28,401
So how was it?

308
00:25:28,568 --> 00:25:30,445
How was what?

309
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:33,490
Your night in MDC.

310
00:25:34,532 --> 00:25:37,202
-I caught up with a few old clients.
-Yeah? Heh.

311
00:25:37,369 --> 00:25:38,995
-Want one?
-Oh.

312
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:43,833
Yeah, this whole thing is...

313
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,794
-...a big misunderstanding.
-Mm-hm.

314
00:25:45,961 --> 00:25:48,546
There's absolutely no way
it's going to trial.

315
00:25:48,713 --> 00:25:50,966
Who wants that hassle?
Not me.

316
00:25:51,132 --> 00:25:54,344
Whichever lucky soul
at the DA's office catches this...

317
00:25:54,511 --> 00:25:56,304
...looking at an easy clear.

318
00:25:56,471 --> 00:25:58,848
There's a felony in there, right?

319
00:25:59,015 --> 00:26:00,934
Well, it'd be a cla-- Go ahead.

320
00:26:01,101 --> 00:26:03,019
Classic case of overcharging.

321
00:26:03,186 --> 00:26:05,063
No offense.

322
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:09,109
Happy to have a civil conversation,
and I'm always ready to make a deal.

323
00:26:09,276 --> 00:26:10,986
Just call me Monty Hall.

324
00:26:11,152 --> 00:26:14,114
So you're looking to plea out
on this then, Monty?

325
00:26:14,281 --> 00:26:16,783
If it's the right plea.

326
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:20,287
I'm not perfect. I made mistakes,
I'm willing to own up to them...

327
00:26:20,453 --> 00:26:24,624
...in a way that is satisfying
to both myself and the state.

328
00:26:24,791 --> 00:26:28,545
Mm-hm. Well, good luck with that.

329
00:26:29,462 --> 00:26:32,799
Good luck with that, as in,
"I wish you well"...

330
00:26:32,966 --> 00:26:34,968
...or "I accept your challenge"?

331
00:26:35,135 --> 00:26:36,720
I wish you well.

332
00:26:37,095 --> 00:26:39,597
Play your cards right, they may go for it.

333
00:26:39,764 --> 00:26:40,765
They?

334
00:26:40,932 --> 00:26:42,183
Not you?

335
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:45,270
Prosecuting your case?
No, man, it's not me.

336
00:26:47,564 --> 00:26:50,317
You never catch a lucky break, do you?

337
00:26:50,483 --> 00:26:53,153
-Bad timing?
-No, conflicted out.

338
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:54,612
Conflicted out?

339
00:26:54,779 --> 00:26:56,281
I mean, I figured that'd happen.

340
00:26:56,448 --> 00:26:59,200
You and I have wheeled and dealed
together too many times.

341
00:26:59,367 --> 00:27:02,579
There's no way
the boss was letting me run that one.

342
00:27:03,371 --> 00:27:04,622
It's not Ericsen, is it?

343
00:27:04,789 --> 00:27:08,418
The whole Albuquerque office is out.
We all know you, Jimmy.

344
00:27:09,961 --> 00:27:11,129
Well, who is it?

345
00:27:11,296 --> 00:27:14,132
I don't know.
They're pulling someone in from Belen.

346
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:16,551
Um, "Hay"?

347
00:27:16,718 --> 00:27:19,262
Something Hay, I think.

348
00:27:19,429 --> 00:27:22,265
I don't know. Boss used the words,
"tough but fair."

349
00:27:24,934 --> 00:27:26,811
Gotta jam. Heh, heh.

350
00:27:32,817 --> 00:27:34,486
Good luck.

351
00:27:38,448 --> 00:27:40,992
Burger's getting cold. Heh.

352
00:27:42,118 --> 00:27:43,328
You want it?

353
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:46,664
-Yeah?
-There's too many trans fats.

354
00:27:46,831 --> 00:27:49,667

00:31:10,994 --> 00:31:13,830
Did your brother
ever have a key to the house?

365
00:31:13,997 --> 00:31:16,332
Before the recent trouble, he did.

366
00:31:16,499 --> 00:31:19,627
He brought me my groceries
and sundries.

367
00:31:19,794 --> 00:31:22,171

who does all that now.

No, nothing like that.

374
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:42,358
He backed me into a cabinet.

375
00:31:42,525 --> 00:31:43,526
Did he have a weapon?

376
00:31:43,693 --> 00:31:47,280
Well, as I mentioned, he used
a fireplace poker to break into my desk.

377
00:31:47,447 --> 00:31:49,240
But he never would've used it on me.

378
00:31:49,449 --> 00:31:51,326
Did you feel physically threatened?

379
00:31:52,452 --> 00:31:56,205
My brother is a lot of things,
but even he has limits.

380
00:31:56,372 --> 00:32:00,293
And you're willing to appear
as a witness, even though he's family?

381
00:32:00,627 --> 00:32:02,378
Unfortunately, yes.

...I'll need your sworn testimony.

384
00:32:08,009 --> 00:32:10,345
I've had situations
involving family members before...

385
00:32:10,511 --> 00:32:14,098
...where the injured party
has ultimately been reluctant...

386
00:32:14,265 --> 00:32:15,767
...to cooperate with my office.

387
00:32:15,975 --> 00:32:17,685

I don't intend to take it easy on
your brother because he's a lawyer.

393
00:32:39,916 --> 00:32:41,209
Of course not.

394
00:32:41,376 --> 00:32:44,337
The bone of contention is
the felony breaking and entering.

395
00:32:44,504 --> 00:32:46,589
He's gonna wanna
plea down to a misdemeanor...

396
00:32:46,756 --> 00:32:48,967
...but I'll hold the line on the felony.

397
00:32:50,093 --> 00:32:53,221
Which means
this could possibly go to trial.

of your comfort and well-being.
