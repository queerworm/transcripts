I think they're pretty clear...

179

if we go over them together.

a second-year associate, right?

184
00:11:35,761 --> 00:11:38,097
-Yep.
-And I came in as a fourth-year.

185
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:39,298
That's right.

186
00:11:39,432 --> 00:11:43,035
So why is a second-year
giving notes to a fourth-year?

which is perfectly fine...

192

You went a tad overboard

197
00:12:14,166 --> 00:12:17,970
It's okay to present a quote from a legal
opinion, but when you use too many...

198
00:12:18,104 --> 00:12:20,339

you don't know...

Heh, I'm sure you do, so....
