Yes, this is James McGill,
but I'm no longer a lawyer, so....

That's right, not a lawyer. Bye.

[FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING]

179
00:17:08,327 --> 00:17:10,596
KIM: So this is what
a midlife crisis looks like?

180
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:13,165
Not midlife crisis.

181
00:17:13,298 --> 00:17:15,534
Clarity. Midlife clarity.

182
00:17:15,667 --> 00:17:18,070
Clarity? Huh.

183
00:17:18,237 --> 00:17:22,508
Clearly explain to me why you walked out
on the best job opportunity of your life.

184
00:17:24,777 --> 00:17:27,046
Get in the pool and I'll tell you.

185
00:17:27,179 --> 00:17:30,649
-Get in the pool?
-Yeah, come on.

186
00:17:30,783 --> 00:17:34,386
Pop in the gift shop and buy a bathing
suit. Get a one-piece, nothing fancy.

187
00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:37,322
The water is perfect, it's 82 degrees.

188
00:17:37,456 --> 00:17:40,125
You can order a drink,
and you gotta try this crab dip.

189
00:17:40,259 --> 00:17:43,262
-Why are you acting like this?
-I'm not acting like anything.

190
00:17:43,395 --> 00:17:46,565
I just finally decided to be me.

191
00:17:47,366 --> 00:17:50,636
Everything okay, Mr. Cumpston?
Would you like another drink?

192
00:17:51,637 --> 00:17:53,639
I'm good with this.

193
00:17:56,508 --> 00:17:58,677
I'll tell you what, Mr. Cumpston.

00:17:58,811 --> 00:18:02,714
If you really wanna talk,
I'll be in the bar. Not for long.

Hey, Rolando, check.

What do you--
What do you mean, "quit the law"?

197
00:18:16,195 --> 00:18:17,863
I quit it, simple as that.

Oh, well, thanks for explaining,
Jimmy...

199
00:18:20,732 --> 00:18:22,701
-...it's super clear now.
-Hey, buddy?

200
00:18:22,835 --> 00:18:25,370
Is that a misprint right there?
It's gotta be, right?

201
00:18:25,504 --> 00:18:26,772
-The Zafiro Añejo?
-Yeah.

202
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:31,543
-That's correct, believe it or not.
-Holy shit, a $50 shot of tequila?

203
00:18:31,677 --> 00:18:33,745
-Is it worth it?
-Apparently.

204
00:18:33,879 --> 00:18:35,647
It's kind of a personal choice thing.

205
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:40,719
Well, I can't die without trying
a $50 shot of tequila, so two.

to the room, can't we?

No, we can't. We....

...and I'll have a glass
of your house red.

We have a cabernet,

Cheating hotels

What, are you in the Mafia now?

Asking if we have a future.

...my life since Chuck
made me come to Albuquerque.

Who cares? This is for me, okay?

00:20:03,302 --> 00:20:05,671

-Sorry...

I was eavesdropping, but I kind of was.

We heard you talking about stocks.

-Yeah, so question...

309
00:23:40,552 --> 00:23:44,156
...if you could settle a debate
between me and my sister.

310
00:23:44,489 --> 00:23:47,159
-We probably shouldn't bother--
-I wouldn't normally do this.

311
00:23:47,492 --> 00:23:51,029
But we need an expert.
This guy sounds like he knows his stuff.

312
00:23:52,864 --> 00:23:56,168
-Yeah, go.
-Okay, here's the question:

313
00:23:56,501 --> 00:23:59,638
When it comes to the stock market,
is there a financial limit...

314
00:23:59,771 --> 00:24:02,674
...to how much
a person's allowed to invest?

315
00:24:03,508 --> 00:24:04,876
A limit?

316
00:24:05,811 --> 00:24:07,479
No, no limit.

317
00:24:07,612 --> 00:24:09,948
Knew it! Oh, even if it's an inheritance?

318
00:24:10,081 --> 00:24:12,617
You know, with, like,
inheritance taxes and whatnot?

319
00:24:12,784 --> 00:24:15,687
-Nope, same.
-That's-- Oh, fantastic.

320
00:24:15,854 --> 00:24:17,756
Thank you, buddy. See, no limit.

321
00:24:17,889 --> 00:24:21,459
Told you we could invest it all,
and it's a smart move, too.

322
00:24:21,593 --> 00:24:23,829
-Sticking it all in the bank? No.
-Um....

323
00:24:23,995 --> 00:24:28,600
Yeah, you can invest all your money,
just make sure you diversify.

324
00:24:28,767 --> 00:24:31,136
Yeah, diversify.

325
00:24:31,469 --> 00:24:34,239
That's-- We gotta-- Hey...

326
00:24:34,606 --> 00:24:36,041
...what do you mean "diversify"?

327
00:24:36,208 --> 00:24:40,846
Well, diversify is-- You know the saying
"don't put all your eggs in one basket"?

328
00:24:41,012 --> 00:24:44,583
-Right? Same principle.
-Makes complete sense. Thank you.

329
00:24:44,716 --> 00:24:47,586
If I had an idea of the money
we're talking about, ballpark...

330
00:24:47,719 --> 00:24:50,622
...I could give you examples
of smart diversification.

331
00:24:51,556 --> 00:24:53,525
Yeah, um....

332
00:24:54,893 --> 00:24:57,762
Look, an uncle on our father's side
recently passed...

333
00:24:57,929 --> 00:25:04,035
...and he left us somewhere
in the neighborhood of 1.4 million.

334
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:08,106
And I don't mean to be greedy,
but I think if we invest it smart now...

335
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,941
...we could double it, triple it...

336
00:25:10,075 --> 00:25:13,578
...we could quadruple
the whole inheritance, right?

337
00:25:13,712 --> 00:25:15,680
In my opinion?

338
00:25:15,814 --> 00:25:17,816
Fortune favors the bold, man.

was looking for more baseball cards?
