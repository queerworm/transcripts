00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:07,785
and incoherent.

582
00:22:07,785 --> 00:22:09,120
How come you didn't call me?

583
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,663
Why did I have

584
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,663
to hear about this

585
00:22:10,663 --> 00:22:13,874
through my brother's

586
00:22:10,663 --> 00:22:13,874
prick of a law partner?

587
00:22:13,874 --> 00:22:15,751
The only contact information

588
00:22:13,874 --> 00:22:15,751
we could find

589
00:22:15,751 --> 00:22:17,586
was a business card.

590
00:22:17,586 --> 00:22:19,839
Jimmy, in my opinion,

591
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:21,423
Charles should be

592
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:21,423
committed

593
00:22:21,423 --> 00:22:24,384
for 30 days of

594
00:22:21,423 --> 00:22:24,384
psychiatric observation.

595
00:22:24,384 --> 00:22:25,803
As a family member,

596
00:22:25,803 --> 00:22:29,223
you can submit a petition

597
00:22:25,803 --> 00:22:29,223
for him to be evaluated.

598
00:22:29,223 --> 00:22:31,267
There's an excellent facility

599
00:22:29,223 --> 00:22:31,267
in Las Cruces.

600
00:22:31,267 --> 00:22:35,188
He can be there tomorrow.

601
00:22:35,188 --> 00:22:37,439
I'd rather not.

602
00:22:37,439 --> 00:22:40,234
Hey, buddy.

603
00:22:37,439 --> 00:22:40,234
Hey, I'm right here.

604
00:22:40,234 --> 00:22:42,987
Oh, hey, Chuck.

605
00:22:40,234 --> 00:22:42,987
Excuse me.

606
00:22:42,987 --> 00:22:45,781
Mr. McGill,

607
00:22:42,987 --> 00:22:45,781
my name is Dr. Cruz.

608
00:22:45,781 --> 00:22:47,533
Do you know why

609
00:22:45,781 --> 00:22:47,533
you're in the hospital?

610
00:22:47,533 --> 00:22:51,287
The police kicked in my door.

611
00:22:47,533 --> 00:22:51,287
No warrant.

612
00:22:51,287 --> 00:22:53,080
No cause.

613
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:56,083
I wasn't incoherent.

614
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:56,083
They just weren't listening.

615
00:22:56,083 --> 00:22:58,376
They Tasered me, Jimmy.

616
00:22:58,376 --> 00:22:59,920
Oh, Jesus.

617
00:23:01,047 --> 00:23:02,340
Kim?

618
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:03,799
I'm sorry, I can

619
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:03,799
give you privacy.

620
00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:06,802
No, no, no,

621
00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:06,802
that's all right. Stay.

622
00:23:06,802 --> 00:23:10,139
Howard called me.

623
00:23:06,802 --> 00:23:10,139
He's very concerned about you.

624
00:23:10,139 --> 00:23:13,142
How are you feeling now,

625
00:23:10,139 --> 00:23:13,142
Mr. McGill?

626
00:23:13,142 --> 00:23:16,145
Do--? Do you have a phone

627
00:23:13,142 --> 00:23:16,145
or a pager

628
00:23:16,145 --> 00:23:20,107
or anything with a battery?

629
00:23:16,145 --> 00:23:20,107
I don't think so. I...

630
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:23,152
[GROANS]

631
00:23:24,362 --> 00:23:26,780
Yeah. Heh.

632
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:28,615
Oversight.

633
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:28,615
Sorry about that.

634
00:23:30,784 --> 00:23:34,538
Can you tell me a little more

635
00:23:30,784 --> 00:23:34,538
about your...

636
00:23:34,538 --> 00:23:36,707
situation?

637
00:23:34,538 --> 00:23:36,707
It's not a situation.

638
00:23:36,707 --> 00:23:38,667
It's a condition.

639
00:23:38,667 --> 00:23:41,128
Electromagnetic

640
00:23:38,667 --> 00:23:41,128
hypersensitivity.

641
00:23:41,128 --> 00:23:44,590
For reasons unknown, my nervous

642
00:23:41,128 --> 00:23:44,590
system has become sensitized

643
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:47,843
to certain frequencies

644
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:47,843
of electromagnetic radiation.

645
00:23:47,843 --> 00:23:50,512
Your brother called it

646
00:23:47,843 --> 00:23:50,512
an allergy to electricity.

647
00:23:50,512 --> 00:23:52,556
Well, it's

648
00:23:50,512 --> 00:23:52,556
an oversimplification.

649
00:23:52,556 --> 00:23:55,184
But it's essentially

650
00:23:52,556 --> 00:23:55,184
correct.

651
00:23:55,184 --> 00:23:58,062
Electronic devices create

652
00:23:58,062 --> 00:24:01,357
their own

653
00:23:58,062 --> 00:24:01,357
electromagnetic fields.

654
00:24:01,357 --> 00:24:04,151
The closer I am

655
00:24:01,357 --> 00:24:04,151
to such devices,

656
00:24:04,151 --> 00:24:06,862
the worse my symptoms.

657
00:24:04,151 --> 00:24:06,862
Which are?

658
00:24:06,862 --> 00:24:09,489
Burning sensation on my skin,

659
00:24:09,489 --> 00:24:12,368
a sharp, cold pain in my bones,

660
00:24:12,368 --> 00:24:15,413
muscle fatigue,

661
00:24:12,368 --> 00:24:15,413
heart palpitations,

662
00:24:15,413 --> 00:24:17,790
blurred vision,

663
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:19,583
tinnitus, vertigo,

664
00:24:19,583 --> 00:24:21,627
nausea, shortness of breath.

665
00:24:21,627 --> 00:24:23,421
A general--

666
00:24:21,627 --> 00:24:23,421
It hurts.

667
00:24:23,421 --> 00:24:25,089
Yes, it hurts.

668
00:24:25,089 --> 00:24:27,967
When did you first experience

669
00:24:25,089 --> 00:24:27,967
these symptoms?

670
00:24:27,967 --> 00:24:30,094
[EXHALES SHARPLY]

671
00:24:27,967 --> 00:24:30,094
Oh, must have been...

672
00:24:30,094 --> 00:24:33,097
You left the office

673
00:24:30,094 --> 00:24:33,097
18 months ago.

674
00:24:33,097 --> 00:24:37,143
Well, in that case, uh,

675
00:24:33,097 --> 00:24:37,143
must have been almost two years.

676
00:24:37,143 --> 00:24:39,312
Two years?

677
00:24:37,143 --> 00:24:39,312
That's a--

678
00:24:39,312 --> 00:24:41,939
That's a long time

679
00:24:39,312 --> 00:24:41,939
to live with discomfort.

680
00:24:41,939 --> 00:24:44,817
Well, there it is.

681
00:24:44,817 --> 00:24:47,278
You think I'm crazy.

682
00:24:47,278 --> 00:24:48,779
I never said that.

683
00:24:48,779 --> 00:24:51,489
No, you didn't,

684
00:24:48,779 --> 00:24:51,489
because you're very polite.

685
00:24:51,489 --> 00:24:53,033
But you think it.

686
00:24:53,033 --> 00:24:55,702
Otherwise you wouldn't be

687
00:24:53,033 --> 00:24:55,702
talking about commitment.

688
00:24:55,702 --> 00:24:58,872
You find that idea distressing?

689
00:24:55,702 --> 00:24:58,872
JIMMY: Who the hell wouldn't?

690
00:24:58,872 --> 00:25:03,002
I find it inappropriate

691
00:24:58,872 --> 00:25:03,002
for a person

692
00:25:03,002 --> 00:25:05,379
suffering from

693
00:25:03,002 --> 00:25:05,379
a physical condition.

694
00:25:07,047 --> 00:25:10,301
Anyone who's spent more than

695
00:25:07,047 --> 00:25:10,301
a few minutes with me knows

696
00:25:10,301 --> 00:25:12,428
that this isn't

697
00:25:10,301 --> 00:25:12,428
some kind of delusion.

698
00:25:12,428 --> 00:25:13,971
Wouldn't you agree, Kim?

699
00:25:13,971 --> 00:25:17,433
JIMMY: Of course she does.

700
00:25:13,971 --> 00:25:17,433
Well, I'm not a doctor.

701
00:25:17,433 --> 00:25:19,601
You've known me

702
00:25:17,433 --> 00:25:19,601
for a decade.

703
00:25:19,601 --> 00:25:21,979
Have you ever seen me

704
00:25:19,601 --> 00:25:21,979
exhibit any sign,

705
00:25:21,979 --> 00:25:24,564
any sign whatsoever,

706
00:25:21,979 --> 00:25:24,564
of mental illness?

707
00:25:24,564 --> 00:25:26,859
See? If I thought

708
00:25:24,564 --> 00:25:26,859
for one second

709
00:25:26,859 --> 00:25:30,279
you could cure me, believe me,

710
00:25:26,859 --> 00:25:30,279
I'd jump at the chance.

711
00:25:30,279 --> 00:25:33,240
With all due respect, psychiatry

712
00:25:30,279 --> 00:25:33,240
doesn't have the answers.

713
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,867
I'd very much like to try.

714
00:25:34,867 --> 00:25:38,704
Section 43-1-11, part E3.

715
00:25:38,704 --> 00:25:40,706
"The proposed commitment

with the treatment needs

of the client

00:25:43,167 --> 00:25:47,171
and with the least drastic

means principle."

721
00:25:47,171 --> 00:25:49,715
Do you think subjecting me

722
00:25:47,171 --> 00:25:49,715
to this kind of pain for a month

723
00:25:49,715 --> 00:25:51,342
is the least drastic means?

724
00:25:51,342 --> 00:25:53,886
JIMMY:

725
00:25:51,342 --> 00:25:53,886
He might as well spend

726
00:25:51,342 --> 00:25:53,886
a month in a wood chipper.

727
00:25:55,721 --> 00:25:58,724
CRUZ:

728
00:25:55,721 --> 00:25:58,724
I understand your frustration.

729
00:25:58,724 --> 00:26:02,644
I do. You're obviously

730
00:25:58,724 --> 00:26:02,644
a highly-intelligent man

731
00:26:02,644 --> 00:26:07,316
in difficult circumstances.

732
00:26:07,316 --> 00:26:10,568
May I ask you a question?

733
00:26:07,316 --> 00:26:10,568
Just for my own interest.

734
00:26:10,568 --> 00:26:12,405
Yeah.

735
00:26:10,568 --> 00:26:12,405
How do you meet

736
00:26:12,405 --> 00:26:13,989
the needs of daily life?

737
00:26:13,989 --> 00:26:15,615
What do you do for light?

738
00:26:15,615 --> 00:26:19,328
How do you prepare food?

739
00:26:15,615 --> 00:26:19,328
I use white gas lanterns.

740
00:26:19,328 --> 00:26:21,621
For cooking,

741
00:26:19,328 --> 00:26:21,621
I have a camp stove.

742
00:26:21,621 --> 00:26:25,209
I have a large cooler

743
00:26:21,621 --> 00:26:25,209
I keep filled with ice.

744
00:26:25,209 --> 00:26:28,295
It's not ideal, but I make do.

745
00:26:28,295 --> 00:26:29,629
CRUZ:

746
00:26:28,295 --> 00:26:29,629
I see.

747
00:26:29,629 --> 00:26:31,924
Well, thank you.

748
00:26:31,924 --> 00:26:33,842
Would you mind

749
00:26:31,924 --> 00:26:33,842
if I took a moment

750
00:26:33,842 --> 00:26:36,178
to speak with your brother?

751
00:26:36,178 --> 00:26:37,971
Uh, make sure you still

752
00:26:36,178 --> 00:26:37,971
have your wallet

753
00:26:37,971 --> 00:26:39,765
when you're done. Heh.

754
00:26:39,765 --> 00:26:41,434
JIMMY: Funny guy.

755
00:26:39,765 --> 00:26:41,434
Heh.

756
00:26:41,434 --> 00:26:42,976
Jimmy.

757
00:26:46,522 --> 00:26:48,274
I wanna go home.

758
00:26:56,907 --> 00:26:58,409
That was

759
00:26:56,907 --> 00:26:58,409
a dirty trick.

760
00:26:58,409 --> 00:27:00,786
That wasn't a trick.

761
00:26:58,409 --> 00:27:00,786
It was a demonstration.

762
00:27:00,786 --> 00:27:03,330
This allergy to electricity

763
00:27:00,786 --> 00:27:03,330
isn't real.

764
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:05,458
It's a manifestation

765
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:05,458
of something deeper.

766
00:27:05,458 --> 00:27:07,126
I'm not saying

767
00:27:05,458 --> 00:27:07,126
it's 100 percent real,

768
00:27:07,126 --> 00:27:09,295
but Chuck is smarter

769
00:27:07,126 --> 00:27:09,295
than you and me put together,

770
00:27:09,295 --> 00:27:11,422
so we're not talking him

771
00:27:09,295 --> 00:27:11,422
out of this.

772
00:27:11,422 --> 00:27:14,133
And I'm not sending him

773
00:27:11,422 --> 00:27:14,133
to a rubber room.

774
00:27:14,133 --> 00:27:16,218
No one is talking

775
00:27:14,133 --> 00:27:16,218
about rubber rooms.

776
00:27:16,218 --> 00:27:18,845
There are specialists--

777
00:27:16,218 --> 00:27:18,845
He's seen specialists.

778
00:27:18,845 --> 00:27:21,557

782
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:24,893

783
00:27:24,893 --> 00:27:27,813

788
00:27:30,941 --> 00:27:32,943
and toilet paper and ice

789
00:27:32,943 --> 00:27:34,736
and every other

790
00:27:32,943 --> 00:27:34,736
damn thing he needs.

791
00:27:34,736 --> 00:27:38,407
Is that helping

792
00:27:34,736 --> 00:27:38,407
or enabling?

793
00:27:38,407 --> 00:27:40,700
If you testify

794
00:27:38,407 --> 00:27:40,700
in a custodial hearing,

795
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:43,120
he can get the help he needs.
