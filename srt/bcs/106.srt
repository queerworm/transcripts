129
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:20,190

Matty didn't get worked up.

134
00:07:27,822 --> 00:07:32,327

I gotta get Kaylee her dinner.

197
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:28,109
Put her to bed.

198
00:09:28,109 --> 00:09:29,652
Oh, yeah.

199
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:33,865
Okay. Ahem.

200
00:09:35,492 --> 00:09:40,080
Well, if you want me to drop by

201
00:09:35,492 --> 00:09:40,080
and keep an eye on her,

202
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,249
I wanna help.

203
00:09:52,175 --> 00:09:54,177
See you around.

204
00:10:27,294 --> 00:10:30,088
MAN:

205
00:10:27,294 --> 00:10:30,088
Where to?

206
00:10:30,088 --> 00:10:32,549
MIKE:

207
00:10:30,088 --> 00:10:32,549
"Francisco."

208
00:10:32,549 --> 00:10:33,925
FRANCISCO:

209
00:10:32,549 --> 00:10:33,925
Yeah.

210
00:10:33,925 --> 00:10:36,636
MIKE: You know this town?

211
00:10:33,925 --> 00:10:36,636
Yeah, sure.

212
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:38,221
How well?

213
00:10:40,515 --> 00:10:44,144
MAN:

214
00:10:40,515 --> 00:10:44,144
You sew this up yourself?

215
00:10:44,144 --> 00:10:46,271
Not bad.

216
00:10:46,271 --> 00:10:48,022
Bet there's

217
00:10:46,271 --> 00:10:48,022
a story there.

218
00:10:48,022 --> 00:10:50,817
Isn't there always?

219
00:10:48,022 --> 00:10:50,817
Yeah.

220
00:10:50,817 --> 00:10:54,112
All right,

221
00:10:50,817 --> 00:10:54,112
a little sting here.

222
00:10:54,112 --> 00:10:58,617
Okay.

223
00:10:54,112 --> 00:10:58,617
That ought to do it.

224
00:10:58,617 --> 00:11:02,162
Now, you're gonna

225
00:10:58,617 --> 00:11:02,162
wanna take it easy.

226
00:11:02,162 --> 00:11:04,289
Keep it clean.

227
00:11:04,289 --> 00:11:07,375
Keep it dry.

228
00:11:04,289 --> 00:11:07,375
Let it heal.

229
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:10,003
There's a Walgreens

230
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:10,003
couple blocks over on Louisiana.

231
00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:12,255
Maybe go get yourself

232
00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:12,255
a sling.

233
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:15,383
You don't have one?

234
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:15,383
Heh. Sorry.

235
00:11:15,383 --> 00:11:18,052
Got a cone you could put

236
00:11:15,383 --> 00:11:18,052
around your neck.

237
00:11:18,052 --> 00:11:21,598
It's about the same, right?

238
00:11:21,598 --> 00:11:25,268
So it's gonna be 500?

239
00:11:21,598 --> 00:11:25,268
Five hundred.

240
00:11:25,268 --> 00:11:30,524
I can, uh, throw some pills

241
00:11:25,268 --> 00:11:30,524
in for the pain.

242
00:11:30,524 --> 00:11:32,317
This stuff's

243
00:11:30,524 --> 00:11:32,317
essentially Vicodin.

244
00:11:32,317 --> 00:11:35,195
I can give it to you

245
00:11:32,317 --> 00:11:35,195
for 25 a pill.

246
00:11:35,195 --> 00:11:36,988
Maybe drop the price to 15

247
00:11:36,988 --> 00:11:39,533
for something a little less

248
00:11:36,988 --> 00:11:39,533
human-centric.

249
00:11:39,533 --> 00:11:42,577
I'm an aspirin man.

250
00:11:42,577 --> 00:11:46,498
Tell you what.

251
00:11:42,577 --> 00:11:46,498
Take a couple on the house.

252
00:11:46,498 --> 00:11:48,875
In case

253
00:11:46,498 --> 00:11:48,875
you change your mind.

254
00:11:51,127 --> 00:11:52,462
You new in town?

255
00:11:52,462 --> 00:11:55,215
MIKE:

256
00:11:52,462 --> 00:11:55,215
Yeah.

257
00:11:55,215 --> 00:11:57,217
Passing through

258
00:11:55,215 --> 00:11:57,217
or sticking around?

259
00:11:57,217 --> 00:11:59,469
Why?

260
00:11:59,469 --> 00:12:01,388
No reason.

261
00:12:01,388 --> 00:12:06,142
It's just if you're relocating

262
00:12:01,388 --> 00:12:06,142
to the land of enchantment,

263
00:12:06,142 --> 00:12:08,853
I know people.

264
00:12:08,853 --> 00:12:10,522
I could get you some work.

265
00:12:10,522 --> 00:12:14,025
I am not looking

266
00:12:10,522 --> 00:12:14,025
for that kind of work.

267
00:12:14,025 --> 00:12:16,528
But...

268
00:12:16,528 --> 00:12:18,071
[GROANS]

269
00:12:18,071 --> 00:12:19,614
...thanks.

270
00:12:22,701 --> 00:12:24,827
Don't know why

271
00:12:22,701 --> 00:12:24,827
it has to be this way.

272
00:12:24,827 --> 00:12:28,122
Could've been friendly.

273
00:12:24,827 --> 00:12:28,122
Could've talked in your house.

274
00:12:28,122 --> 00:12:30,500
You really want

275
00:12:28,122 --> 00:12:30,500
the formal treatment?

276
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,252
Lawyer.

277
00:12:32,252 --> 00:12:34,128
Come on, Mike.

278
00:12:34,128 --> 00:12:38,550
It's just a couple of questions.

279
00:12:34,128 --> 00:12:38,550
Ain't nothing but a thing.

280
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:40,343
Lawyer.

281
00:12:40,343 --> 00:12:42,220
You're not under arrest.

282
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:45,599
Did anybody here say "arrest"?

283
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:45,599
No. You wanna walk, walk.

284
00:12:45,599 --> 00:12:49,185
But I gotta say, I expected more

285
00:12:45,599 --> 00:12:49,185
cooperation from you on this.

286
00:12:49,185 --> 00:12:50,769
Cop to cop.

287
00:12:52,606 --> 00:12:54,649
Lawyer.

288
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:00,154
[SIGHS]

289
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:05,784
Fine.

290
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:05,784
What lawyer?

291
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:16,713
Ehrmantraut,

292
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:16,713
who's got him and where?

293
00:13:16,713 --> 00:13:18,339
That way.

294
00:13:19,424 --> 00:13:21,217
Hey, fellas,

295
00:13:19,424 --> 00:13:21,217
how you doing?

296
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:24,512
James McGill.

297
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:24,512
I'm here to see my client.

298
00:13:25,722 --> 00:13:28,057
What?

299
00:13:25,722 --> 00:13:28,057
You look like Matlock.

300
00:13:28,057 --> 00:13:29,517
No, I look like

301
00:13:29,517 --> 00:13:32,811
a young Paul Newman

302
00:13:29,517 --> 00:13:32,811
dressed as Matlock.

303
00:13:32,811 --> 00:13:34,355
Where's my guy?

304
00:13:37,984 --> 00:13:39,444
Say hello to Barney Fife.

305
00:13:39,444 --> 00:13:41,946
Wrong show,

306
00:13:39,444 --> 00:13:41,946
but thanks for playing.

307
00:13:43,906 --> 00:13:46,075
[SIGHS]

308
00:13:46,075 --> 00:13:47,410
So, what happened?

309
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:50,037
Mayor didn't give you

310
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:50,037
enough stickers?

311
00:13:52,081 --> 00:13:54,417
You wanna tell me

312
00:13:52,081 --> 00:13:54,417
what we're doing here?

313
00:13:54,417 --> 00:13:56,294
Oh, here's your coffee.

314
00:13:56,294 --> 00:13:57,671
Uh...

315
00:13:57,671 --> 00:13:59,297
Hope it's good

316
00:13:57,671 --> 00:13:59,297
to the last drop,

317
00:13:59,297 --> 00:14:01,591
because I'm billing you

318
00:13:59,297 --> 00:14:01,591
the full hour for it.

319
00:14:01,591 --> 00:14:03,217
That's for you.

320
00:14:03,217 --> 00:14:05,679
Oh, that's very thoughtful.

321
00:14:07,555 --> 00:14:10,684
You serious? Why'd you

322
00:14:07,555 --> 00:14:10,684
have me bring it to you?

323
00:14:10,684 --> 00:14:12,519
All right, here's

324
00:14:10,684 --> 00:14:12,519
what's gonna happen:

325
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:15,062
Those two cops out there

326
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:15,062
are from Philadelphia.

327
00:14:15,062 --> 00:14:16,981
They've gone

328
00:14:15,062 --> 00:14:16,981
a long way to see me.

329
00:14:16,981 --> 00:14:19,693
When they come in here, we're

330
00:14:16,981 --> 00:14:19,693
all gonna have a little chat.

331
00:14:19,693 --> 00:14:21,194
When it's over,

332
00:14:19,693 --> 00:14:21,194
the young one,

333
00:14:21,194 --> 00:14:23,029
who's been writing

334
00:14:21,194 --> 00:14:23,029
in his little notebook,

335
00:14:23,029 --> 00:14:25,156
he's gonna take it

336
00:14:23,029 --> 00:14:25,156
and put it in his jacket,

337
00:14:25,156 --> 00:14:27,033
and when he does that,

338
00:14:27,033 --> 00:14:30,328
I want you to take that coffee

339
00:14:27,033 --> 00:14:30,328
and spill it on him.

340
00:14:30,328 --> 00:14:32,622
Little accident,

341
00:14:30,328 --> 00:14:32,622
that's all.

342
00:14:32,622 --> 00:14:35,249
And why, pray tell,

343
00:14:32,622 --> 00:14:35,249
would I do that?

344
00:14:35,249 --> 00:14:38,252
Because I'm asking you to. It's

345
00:14:35,249 --> 00:14:38,252
the only reason you're here.

346
00:14:38,252 --> 00:14:41,005
So I'm here because you want me

347
00:14:38,252 --> 00:14:41,005
to assault a police officer?

348
00:14:41,005 --> 00:14:43,800
I am asking you

349
00:14:41,005 --> 00:14:43,800
to take a few ounces

350
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:46,636
of lukewarm coffee

351
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:46,636
and spill it on him.

352
00:14:46,636 --> 00:14:49,930
I doubt that satisfies

353
00:14:46,636 --> 00:14:49,930
the definition of "assault."

354
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:52,975
But, hey,

355
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:52,975
you're the lawyer.

356
00:14:52,975 --> 00:14:55,645
Right, how silly of me.

357
00:14:55,645 --> 00:14:57,689
All you want is

358
00:14:55,645 --> 00:14:57,689
for me to aid and abet

359
00:14:57,689 --> 00:14:59,440
you ripping off

360
00:14:57,689 --> 00:14:59,440
that guy's notepad,

361
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,693
because that's what

362
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,693
you're doing here, right? Huh?

363
00:15:01,693 --> 00:15:04,487
What, are you nuts?

364
00:15:01,693 --> 00:15:04,487
You can't be serious.

365
00:15:04,487 --> 00:15:07,699
Hey, I hate to remind you

366
00:15:04,487 --> 00:15:07,699
of this, but you owe me one.

367
00:15:07,699 --> 00:15:10,326
The assist I gave you with

368
00:15:07,699 --> 00:15:10,326
the missing persons problem.

369
00:15:10,326 --> 00:15:11,994
One good turn and so forth.

370
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:14,914
You want a good turn?

371
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:14,914
Here's your good turn, okay?

372
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:17,375
I'm gonna behave

373
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:17,375
like an honest-to-God,

374
00:15:17,375 --> 00:15:20,127
law-abiding,

375
00:15:17,375 --> 00:15:20,127
licensed attorney.

376
00:15:20,127 --> 00:15:21,588
'Cause clearly

377
00:15:20,127 --> 00:15:21,588
you need one

378
00:15:21,588 --> 00:15:23,297
with whatever the hell

379
00:15:21,588 --> 00:15:23,297
is going on here.

380
00:15:23,297 --> 00:15:25,341
Those two jokers

381
00:15:23,297 --> 00:15:25,341
out in the hallway,

382
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:27,927
I'm gonna make sure they dot

383
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:27,927
their I's and cross their T's.

384
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:29,679
Everything square

385
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:29,679
and aboveboard.

386
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:31,431
That's what I'm gonna do,

387
00:15:31,431 --> 00:15:33,683
and you're gonna be happy

388
00:15:31,431 --> 00:15:33,683
as hell that I'm here.

389
00:15:33,683 --> 00:15:38,020
But this little Juan Valdez

390
00:15:33,683 --> 00:15:38,020
bump-and-dump? No.

391
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:39,731
Not gonna happen.

392
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:44,903
Hey, gentlemen,

393
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:44,903
we're prepared to indulge you.

394
00:15:46,821 --> 00:15:49,490
MAN:

395
00:15:46,821 --> 00:15:49,490
Detective Escalaire

396
00:15:46,821 --> 00:15:49,490
will be sitting in with us

397
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:50,700
as per A.P.D. policy.

398
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:54,036
Okay with you, right?

399
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:54,036
Fine with me.

400
00:15:54,036 --> 00:15:55,622
Okay.

401
00:15:55,622 --> 00:15:59,250
You got your lawyer, Mike.

402
00:15:55,622 --> 00:15:59,250
Can we talk already?

403
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:01,335
Great.

404
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:01,335
So like we said,

405
00:16:01,335 --> 00:16:03,797
we're here looking into

406
00:16:01,335 --> 00:16:03,797
this Hoffman and Fensky thing.

407
00:16:03,797 --> 00:16:06,299
Yeah, whatever you can tell us.

408
00:16:03,797 --> 00:16:06,299
Anything at all.

409
00:16:06,299 --> 00:16:08,301
Uh, hold on, hold on.

410
00:16:08,301 --> 00:16:12,388
Hoffman, Fensky.

411
00:16:08,301 --> 00:16:12,388
Fill me in.

412
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:14,557
Assume I know

413
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:14,557
absolutely nothing

414
00:16:14,557 --> 00:16:15,975
about my client here,

415
00:16:14,557 --> 00:16:15,975
all right?

416
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:18,269
Start at the beginning.

417
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:18,269
Jesus, seriously?

418
00:16:18,269 --> 00:16:21,021
Look, don't let

419
00:16:18,269 --> 00:16:21,021
Mr. Ehrmantraut's dancing eyes

420
00:16:21,021 --> 00:16:24,484
and bubbly bon vivant

421
00:16:21,021 --> 00:16:24,484
personality fool you.

422
00:16:24,484 --> 00:16:27,987
He's actually, believe it

423
00:16:24,484 --> 00:16:27,987
or not, somewhat taciturn.

424
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:31,616
Shall I fan you gently

425
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:31,616
so you don't go into shock?

426
00:16:31,616 --> 00:16:35,411
Start at the beginning, okay?

427
00:16:31,616 --> 00:16:35,411
We're talking Book of Genesis.

428
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:37,163
Okay, Mr. McGill.

429
00:16:37,163 --> 00:16:39,791
As you probably gathered,

430
00:16:37,163 --> 00:16:39,791
we, Detective Sanders and I,

431
00:16:39,791 --> 00:16:42,209
work for the Philadelphia

432
00:16:39,791 --> 00:16:42,209
Police Department,

433
00:16:42,209 --> 00:16:44,462
as did Mr. Ehrmantraut

434
00:16:42,209 --> 00:16:44,462
for nearly 30 years.

435
00:16:44,462 --> 00:16:47,340
Philadelphia?

436
00:16:44,462 --> 00:16:47,340
Go, Eagles.

437
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:51,218
Mr. Ehrmantraut had a son, Matt,

438
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:51,218
he too was with Philly P.D.

439
00:16:51,218 --> 00:16:54,096
He was a rookie officer

440
00:16:51,218 --> 00:16:54,096
with about two years on the job.

441
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:56,724
He was a good cop.

442
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:56,724
Yes, he was.

443
00:16:56,724 --> 00:16:59,018
About nine months ago,

444
00:16:56,724 --> 00:16:59,018
he responded

445
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:02,438
to a shots-fired call

446
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:02,438
in some west-side rattrap.

447
00:17:02,438 --> 00:17:04,983
Matt went in with his partner,

448
00:17:02,438 --> 00:17:04,983
Officer Troy Hoffman.

449
00:17:04,983 --> 00:17:07,986
They had Sergeant Jack Fensky

450
00:17:04,983 --> 00:17:07,986
backing them up.

451
00:17:07,986 --> 00:17:10,488
Unfortunately,

452
00:17:07,986 --> 00:17:10,488
things got out of hand.

453
00:17:10,488 --> 00:17:12,114
The three of them

454
00:17:10,488 --> 00:17:12,114
were ambushed,

455
00:17:12,114 --> 00:17:14,074
and, uh, Matt

456
00:17:12,114 --> 00:17:14,074
didn't make it out.

457
00:17:14,074 --> 00:17:16,076
Now, Hoffman and Fensky

458
00:17:14,074 --> 00:17:16,076
returned fire,

459
00:17:16,076 --> 00:17:17,453
but the shooter got away.

460
00:17:17,453 --> 00:17:18,913
We chased a few leads,

461
00:17:18,913 --> 00:17:21,582
shook up the usual suspects,

462
00:17:18,913 --> 00:17:21,582
came up short.

463
00:17:23,543 --> 00:17:26,420
I'm very sorry to hear it.

464
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:29,507
Anyways, we kept beating

465
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:29,507
the bushes, kept coming up dry,

466
00:17:29,507 --> 00:17:31,467
until three months ago.

467
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:33,803
That's when Hoffman

468
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:33,803
and Fensky turned up dead

469
00:17:33,803 --> 00:17:35,346
in a vacant lot

470
00:17:33,803 --> 00:17:35,346
out in Nicetown.

471
00:17:35,346 --> 00:17:38,265
Again, an ambush

472
00:17:35,346 --> 00:17:38,265
of some kind, it looks like.

473
00:17:38,265 --> 00:17:40,434
And with whoever killed Matt

474
00:17:38,265 --> 00:17:40,434
out there in the wind,

475
00:17:40,434 --> 00:17:42,770
we're thinking-- Well,

476
00:17:40,434 --> 00:17:42,770
it's our operating theory--

477
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:45,398
that Hoffman and Fensky

478
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:45,398
were mixed up in something.

479
00:17:45,398 --> 00:17:47,567
Some bad business.

480
00:17:47,567 --> 00:17:49,027
And maybe that

481
00:17:47,567 --> 00:17:49,027
got Matt killed.

482
00:17:49,027 --> 00:17:51,320
Yeah, sorry, I gotta do

483
00:17:49,027 --> 00:17:51,320
my lawyer thing here.

484
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:54,281
Uh, what does my client

485
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:54,281
have to do with any of this?

486
00:17:54,281 --> 00:17:57,326
Uh, Mike,

487
00:17:54,281 --> 00:17:57,326
this is a Hail Mary.

488
00:17:57,326 --> 00:17:58,745
Beyond that.

489
00:17:58,745 --> 00:18:00,955
I mean,

490
00:17:58,745 --> 00:18:00,955
if we had any hard evidence

491
00:18:00,955 --> 00:18:03,082
or leads,

492
00:18:00,955 --> 00:18:03,082
we wouldn't be out here.

493
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:04,918
Is there anything

494
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:04,918
you can tell us about

495
00:18:04,918 --> 00:18:06,920
what Hoffman and Fensky

496
00:18:04,918 --> 00:18:06,920
were into?

497
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,337
Yeah, help us out, Mike.

498
00:18:08,337 --> 00:18:10,381
Help us catch the bastard

499
00:18:08,337 --> 00:18:10,381
who killed Matty.

500
00:18:13,927 --> 00:18:16,387
I don't know much

501
00:18:13,927 --> 00:18:16,387
about Hoffman and Fensky.

502
00:18:16,387 --> 00:18:19,766
They were Matt's people.

503
00:18:16,387 --> 00:18:19,766
I'd see them around sometimes.

504
00:18:19,766 --> 00:18:22,060
I saw 'em in a bar

505
00:18:19,766 --> 00:18:22,060
the night they died.

506
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:24,729
It was McClure's,

507
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:24,729
maybe The Red Dog.

508
00:18:24,729 --> 00:18:27,356
Probably McClure's.

509
00:18:27,356 --> 00:18:29,191
Were they drinking

510
00:18:27,356 --> 00:18:29,191
with anyone?

511
00:18:29,191 --> 00:18:31,485
It's a cop bar. They were

512
00:18:29,191 --> 00:18:31,485
drinking with everyone.

513
00:18:31,485 --> 00:18:33,654
MAN:

514
00:18:31,485 --> 00:18:33,654
You see them

515
00:18:31,485 --> 00:18:33,654
with anyone in particular?

516
00:18:33,654 --> 00:18:35,656
I couldn't tell you.

517
00:18:33,654 --> 00:18:35,656
I was...

518
00:18:36,657 --> 00:18:38,284
You know how I was.

519
00:18:38,284 --> 00:18:39,953
How you doing these days?

520
00:18:39,953 --> 00:18:42,080
MIKE:

521
00:18:39,953 --> 00:18:42,080
Feeling like I crawled out

522
00:18:39,953 --> 00:18:42,080
from the bottom

523
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:45,541
of a bottle

524
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:45,541
and working hard to stay there.

525
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:47,334
Although, I've gotta say,

526
00:18:47,334 --> 00:18:50,880
it doesn't help much

527
00:18:47,334 --> 00:18:50,880
dredging up the past like this.

528
00:18:52,048 --> 00:18:53,925
Let me ask you,

529
00:18:53,925 --> 00:18:56,010
when did you come out here

530
00:18:53,925 --> 00:18:56,010
to Albuquerque?

531
00:18:56,010 --> 00:18:58,679
It couldn't have been, uh,

532
00:18:56,010 --> 00:18:58,679
too much later.

533
00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:00,473
I think it was

534
00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:00,473
the very next day.

535
00:19:00,473 --> 00:19:05,061
Yeah? The day after Hoffman

536
00:19:00,473 --> 00:19:05,061
and Fensky died, huh?

537
00:19:05,061 --> 00:19:08,564
You didn't think to, uh, stick

538
00:19:05,061 --> 00:19:08,564
around once you heard the news?

539
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:11,400
I don't think I heard the news

540
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:11,400
till I was west of Kansas City.

541
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:14,445
Still, you, uh, didn't come back

542
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:14,445
for the funerals, correct?

543
00:19:14,445 --> 00:19:17,323
Even though Hoffman

544
00:19:14,445 --> 00:19:17,323
was Matt's partner.

545
00:19:17,323 --> 00:19:20,451
SANDERS:

546
00:19:17,323 --> 00:19:20,451
You remember anything

547
00:19:17,323 --> 00:19:20,451
about that night at the bar?

548
00:19:20,451 --> 00:19:22,787
Did you talk to Hoffman

549
00:19:20,451 --> 00:19:22,787
or Fensky at all?

550
00:19:22,787 --> 00:19:27,041
Sorry, I got nothing.

551
00:19:22,787 --> 00:19:27,041
They weren't my people.

552
00:19:27,041 --> 00:19:30,711
I'm sorry you guys took a flyer

553
00:19:27,041 --> 00:19:30,711
on me. I wish it had paid off.

554
00:19:30,711 --> 00:19:33,965
That it? We done here?

555
00:19:33,965 --> 00:19:36,134
We're done here, yeah.

556
00:19:36,134 --> 00:19:38,136
That wasn't so hard, huh?

557
00:19:38,136 --> 00:19:39,929
Thanks, Mike.

558
00:19:38,136 --> 00:19:39,929
Yeah.

559
00:19:39,929 --> 00:19:42,473
We're probably gonna kick around

560
00:19:39,929 --> 00:19:42,473
for another couple days,

561
00:19:42,473 --> 00:19:46,268
in case you think of something.

562
00:19:42,473 --> 00:19:46,268
I've never been out west before.

563
00:19:47,812 --> 00:19:51,065
Oh, hey--

564
00:19:47,812 --> 00:19:51,065
Oh! Shit.

565
00:19:51,065 --> 00:19:52,525
Jeez. Sorry. Sorry.

566
00:19:51,065 --> 00:19:52,525
Come on.

567
00:19:52,525 --> 00:19:53,776
Got any paper towels?

568
00:19:53,776 --> 00:19:57,113
Hey, I got it. Thank you.

569
00:19:53,776 --> 00:19:57,113
Sorry.

570
00:20:14,839 --> 00:20:16,549
[CAR STARTS]

571
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:18,134
Oh, for the love of--

572
00:20:18,134 --> 00:20:22,346
You gotta do that right here?

573
00:20:18,134 --> 00:20:22,346
Right in front of me?

574
00:20:22,346 --> 00:20:24,306
What's so important in there

575
00:20:22,346 --> 00:20:24,306
that we had to pull

576
00:20:24,306 --> 00:20:27,309
that third-rate

577
00:20:24,306 --> 00:20:27,309
Marx Brothers routine?

578
00:20:27,309 --> 00:20:29,353
You really wanna know?

579
00:20:29,353 --> 00:20:31,689
And risk getting a piece

580
00:20:29,353 --> 00:20:31,689

00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:45,675
two days later.

968
00:39:50,513 --> 00:39:55,018
He was the strongest person

969
00:39:50,513 --> 00:39:55,018
that I ever knew.

970
00:39:55,018 --> 00:39:59,231
He'd have never done it,

971
00:39:55,018 --> 00:39:59,231
not even to save himself.

972
00:40:00,732 --> 00:40:03,151
I was the only one.

973
00:40:04,485 --> 00:40:06,238
I was the only one

974
00:40:04,485 --> 00:40:06,238
that could get him

975
00:40:06,238 --> 00:40:08,907
to debase himself

976
00:40:06,238 --> 00:40:08,907
like that.

977
00:40:10,325 --> 00:40:13,036
[CHUCKLES]

978
00:40:13,036 --> 00:40:15,288
And it was for nothing.

979
00:40:17,207 --> 00:40:19,584
I made him lesser.

980
00:40:21,294 --> 00:40:23,963
I made him like me.

981
00:40:28,718 --> 00:40:31,637
And the bastards

982
00:40:28,718 --> 00:40:31,637
killed him anyway.

983
00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:53,618
Hoffman and Fensky...

984
00:40:56,246 --> 00:40:58,831
if they killed Matty,

985
00:41:00,375 --> 00:41:02,543
who killed them?

986
00:41:03,878 --> 00:41:06,256
Pop?

987
00:41:06,256 --> 00:41:08,133
What happened?

988
00:41:12,637 --> 00:41:14,973
You know what happened.

989
00:41:17,183 --> 00:41:19,311
The question is...

990
00:41:22,605 --> 00:41:24,774
can you live with it?

991
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:45,420
