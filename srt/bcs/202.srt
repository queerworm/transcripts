I know it seems like a scam,
but it makes a huge difference.

And I would get her washed
at least once a week...

...and spring for the hand wax.

there's nothing illegal going on here.

00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:16,827
-Private like drug dealer maybe?
-No, no.

484
00:38:16,961 --> 00:38:19,463
He's being evasive
because it's a sensitive subject.

485
00:38:19,597 --> 00:38:23,501
It's very delicate
and of no concern to law enforcement.

to a personal dispute.

00:39:00,705 --> 00:39:03,040

and the baseball cards?

503
00:39:29,567 --> 00:39:33,571
Well, there was a misunderstanding.
I mean, call it creative differences.

504
00:39:33,704 --> 00:39:36,540
Artists are volatile creatures.

505

Guys, this all comes down
to just a lovers' spat. Okay?

506

that happens...

507
00:39:47,084 --> 00:39:50,020
...and the patron stole the videos.

508
00:39:50,154 --> 00:39:52,890
And the baseball cards,
to make a point, I guess.

509
00:39:53,023 --> 00:39:57,595
But the headline here is
it's all settled, hearts have mended...

510
00:39:57,728 --> 00:40:01,665
...and Mr. Wormald
will not be pressing charges.

512
00:40:05,436 --> 00:40:08,572
-They were private.
-You said that.

513
00:40:09,907 --> 00:40:13,477
They were videos intended...

514
00:40:13,611 --> 00:40:16,781
...to titillate the senses.

515
00:40:16,914 --> 00:40:21,152
