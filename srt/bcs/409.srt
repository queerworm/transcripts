00:26:56,114 --> 00:26:57,532
He's not doing anything.

350
00:26:57,699 --> 00:27:01,411
He and the other guy ordered some food,
and they're just sitting.

00:27:31,107 --> 00:27:34,903
This is the best chicken I've ever had.

Well, heh, heh,
I am delighted to hear that.

357
00:27:37,614 --> 00:27:39,199
No, really, I'm serious. I mean...

...it's crispy, but it's not dried out.

359

And the seasoning, it's so flavorful.

Well, thank you.
Is there anything else I can do for you?

Would you be interested in franchising?

368
00:28:07,102 --> 00:28:09,646
Because I would be eager to invest.

369
00:28:09,854 --> 00:28:13,191
Well, perhaps we should go to my office,
where we can discuss it further.

370
00:28:13,358 --> 00:28:15,110
Excellent.

I've been an admirer

00:28:35,463 --> 00:28:36,923
You have how many restaurants?

377
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:39,426
-Seven.
-Seven.

It's incredible.

I come here on behalf

-...to give you our deepest thanks.
-Well, for what?

For what?

383
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:55,692
For saving Don Hector's life.

384
00:28:55,859 --> 00:28:57,360
I just visited him.

385
00:28:57,527 --> 00:29:01,156
You know, seeing a man like that,
can't speak, can barely move--

386
00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:03,533
I wanted to weep.

387
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:05,869
But it could have been worse.

388
00:29:06,035 --> 00:29:09,164
Varga tells me that while everyone else
was picking their asses...

389
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:12,125
...you rushed to him, struck him
on the chest and brought him back.

390
00:29:12,292 --> 00:29:14,377
It was a simple instinct.

391
00:29:14,544 --> 00:29:18,006
But still, with all the history
between you two.

392
00:29:18,173 --> 00:29:21,009
What you did was a gesture of peace.

At least, that's how we see it.

[IN SPANISH] You ever think, maybe
Don Eladio is one shrewd bastard?

397
00:29:38,693 --> 00:29:41,738
Maybe he likes the bad blood
between us?

398
00:29:43,031 --> 00:29:49,120
He sits by his pool, baking in the sun,
giving orders.

Salamanca muscle keeps everyone in line.

...I'm sure Eladio wouldn't like that,
would he?

That's right.

00:32:14,307 --> 00:32:16,559
I believe if you look
at the supplemental materials...

425
00:32:16,726 --> 00:32:20,188
...there's a letter from my supervisor,
Brad Markham.

426
00:32:20,688 --> 00:32:22,398
Ah. Good.

427
00:32:23,608 --> 00:32:26,444

with your commitment.

from my manager, Mr. Robert Finn.

431
00:32:34,744 --> 00:32:38,206
It's also in the supplemental materials.

-Three months in a row?
-It's a sales award.

Mr. Finn and the people at CC Mobile
have been very generous.

You don't have to sell many phones
to get in the Silver, believe me.

What made you choose
that particular field?

00:32:55,348 --> 00:32:58,226
Honestly? Just to put bread on the table.

00:32:58,393 --> 00:33:02,939

a new outlook on client relations.

After dealing with cell phone contracts,
explaining statues to my clients...

440

Any of you follow that?

446
00:33:24,752 --> 00:33:28,047
It has to do with the admissibility
of ex parte examinations.

-That was a Supreme Court case?
-That's right.

00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:35,221
How did it go? "The only indicium
of reliability sufficient to satisfy...

...constitutional demands
is the one the Constitution...

00:33:37,932 --> 00:33:40,893
...actually prescribes: confrontation."

451
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:43,062
It's classic Scalia.

452
00:33:43,438 --> 00:33:47,316
I can't help but think about victims forced
to confront their assailants in open court.

But on the other hand, the Sixth
Amendment is pretty controlling--

Ahem. I'm sorry. I just--

00:33:54,741 --> 00:33:57,243

00:33:57,410 --> 00:34:01,539
Short answer,
I've been doing my level best. Heh.

457
00:34:03,082 --> 00:34:06,794
Mr. McGill, is there anything you'd like
to tell us about the reasons...

458
00:34:06,961 --> 00:34:08,921
...you were suspended
in the first place?

459
00:34:09,464 --> 00:34:14,093
This past year, that's pretty much
been the only thing on my mind.

460
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:20,016
And I'm humbled by the sheer stupidity
of my actions.

461
00:34:20,516 --> 00:34:22,852
Remorse doesn't begin to cover it.

462
00:34:23,019 --> 00:34:26,355
I'm not gonna make excuses,
because there's no excuse for what I did.

463
00:34:26,522 --> 00:34:29,776
But as I sit here, I can assure you...

464
00:34:29,942 --> 00:34:33,780
...nothing like that
will ever happen again.

465
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:35,656
Never.

466
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:41,746
Well, all right.
That would seem to be satisfactory.

00:34:42,163 --> 00:34:43,915
Meg? You have something?

468
00:34:45,458 --> 00:34:49,212
Mr. McGill,
what does the law mean to you?

469
00:34:52,673 --> 00:34:54,258
The law?

470
00:34:57,845 --> 00:35:00,640
Yeah. Okay.

471
00:35:03,392 --> 00:35:04,685
Um....

472
00:35:06,979 --> 00:35:08,731
Listen, growing up...

473
00:35:08,898 --> 00:35:13,361
...becoming a lawyer
was the last thing on my mind.

474
00:35:13,861 --> 00:35:18,199
Even if I wanted to,
I didn't have the smarts or the skills...

475
00:35:18,366 --> 00:35:20,827
...or the "stick-to-it-iveness."

476
00:35:20,993 --> 00:35:25,373
But I happened to get a job
with some attorneys...

477
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:29,627
...and I couldn't help but think
"Maybe I could do that?"

478
00:35:29,794 --> 00:35:34,382
Something inside me
made me wanna try.

479
00:35:34,841 --> 00:35:36,175
Now, listen:

480
00:35:36,342 --> 00:35:40,888
My diploma says the University
of American Samoa Law School.

481
00:35:41,055 --> 00:35:45,101
And that's exactly what it sounds like,
that's a correspondence school.

482
00:35:45,268 --> 00:35:48,146
I wish it said Georgetown, heh...

483
00:35:48,312 --> 00:35:49,939
...or Northwestern.

484
00:35:50,106 --> 00:35:53,901
But UAS was the only one
that would take me.

485
00:35:54,443 --> 00:35:58,447
Because, let me tell you,
I wasn't a natural.

486
00:35:58,614 --> 00:36:03,369
I mean, the classes,
the studying, trying to pass the bar?

487
00:36:03,536 --> 00:36:04,745
Practically killed me.

488
00:36:04,912 --> 00:36:08,040
I must have quit 10 or 12 times...

489
00:36:08,207 --> 00:36:12,170
...but I kept coming back to it.
And I'm really glad I did.

490
00:36:12,336 --> 00:36:15,840
Because when I got to work
with actual clients...

491
00:36:16,007 --> 00:36:18,759
...there was nothing else like it.

492
00:36:19,177 --> 00:36:23,181
Our legal system is complicated,
and sometimes it could feel capricious...

493
00:36:23,347 --> 00:36:27,143
...but it's the closest thing
to real justice that we've got.

494
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:32,899
And for it to work, it needs vigorous,
passionate advocates.

495
00:36:33,065 --> 00:36:35,443
Helping my clients, you know...

496
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:38,070
...arguing on their behalf...

497
00:36:38,237 --> 00:36:41,073
...that's the best thing I've ever done.

498
00:36:42,491 --> 00:36:44,702
And this past year...

499
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:47,788
...I've missed the hell out of it.

500
00:36:55,463 --> 00:36:57,715
That was very eloquent.

501
00:36:59,884 --> 00:37:04,722

influence on your views?
