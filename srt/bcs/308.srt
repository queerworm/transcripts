00:14:19,483 --> 00:14:21,485
Remind me, how much
is all this gonna cost?

173
00:14:21,652 --> 00:14:23,779
Exactly what we talked about
the other day.

174
00:14:23,946 --> 00:14:26,407
The first one was gratis.
That's my treat.

175
00:14:26,574 --> 00:14:28,325
Now we're moving on
to the elite package.

176
00:14:28,492 --> 00:14:33,205
Seven commercials for
the heavily discounted price of $6500.

177
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:36,375
Yeah, the station just
quoted me $450 per.

178
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:39,753
-Four hundred and fifty dollars?
-That's for airtime only.

179
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:40,963
Call the station.

180
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:43,549
Ask them how much
they charge for production...

181
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:45,801
...of seven top-flight TV commercials.

182
00:14:45,968 --> 00:14:49,013
Okay, but why do we need
seven new ones in the first place?

183
00:14:49,179 --> 00:14:50,764
Yeah, what's to stop us....

184
00:14:50,931 --> 00:14:54,310
...from paying the station to just
keep running the one we have?

185
00:14:54,476 --> 00:14:58,606
That's not what we agreed to.
How about that for starters?

186
00:15:00,232 --> 00:15:03,652
-He did give us the first one for free.
-Yeah, I know.

187
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:06,071
Okay, how about this?

188
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:10,075
How about we pay you
450 for the one that already aired...

189
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:11,994
...and then we take it from there.

190
00:15:12,161 --> 00:15:14,038
Guys, I don't wanna
get technical on you.

191
00:15:14,204 --> 00:15:17,207
But that commercial,
it doesn't actually belong to you.

192
00:15:17,374 --> 00:15:22,588
It's the real and intellectual property
of Saul Goodman Productions.

193
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:25,382
-I don't think so. I mean, it's our faces.
-It's our store.

194
00:15:25,549 --> 00:15:30,012
And it's my commercial, and you can't
run it without my permission.

195
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:32,431
-Oh. Okay.
-Okay. Wanna play it like that? Okay.

196
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:34,308
$450 is now off the table.

197
00:15:34,475 --> 00:15:36,644
-Yeah, and that crew of yours....
-Yeah.

198
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:38,854
Just a bunch of UNM students.

199
00:15:39,313 --> 00:15:40,648
-We can get those.
-We can get students.

200
00:15:40,731 --> 00:15:42,399
-We can get students. We could...
-Yes, we can.

201
00:15:42,483 --> 00:15:43,651
-...reshoot the ad.
-Yes.

202
00:15:43,817 --> 00:15:46,236
-And then run that.
-Guys, guys, come on.

203
00:15:46,403 --> 00:15:48,906
You wouldn't even be thinking
about a commercial if it wasn't for me.

204
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:51,617
Okay, we are not
gonna pay you $6500...

205
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:53,911
...for something
we can do ourselves, you got it?

206
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:55,079
Seriously?

207
00:15:55,245 --> 00:15:56,246
-Seriously.
-Seriously.

208
00:15:56,413 --> 00:15:57,706
Excuse us.

209
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:00,292
MAN 1:
Hello there.

210
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:02,002
Anything we can help you with?

211
00:16:02,169 --> 00:16:04,463
-[GROUP CHATTERING]
-[JIMMY SCOFFS]

212
00:16:19,269 --> 00:16:22,439
-Put that camera back up. Roll it.
-It's not gonna do a damn thing.

213
00:16:22,606 --> 00:16:27,319
Don't give me any lip, okay? Just roll it.
Make sure it's pointed in my direction.

214
00:16:28,028 --> 00:16:31,532
MAN 2: It's all about output. What you get
out of it is what you put into it.

215
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:34,243
-If you're gigging a lot--
MAN 1: Are you gigging a lot?

216
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:37,830
Hey, sorry to interrupt. I just wanna
make sure there's no wiggle room here.

217
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:42,209
We are with customers right now.
Please, all right, just go. Thank you.

218
00:16:42,376 --> 00:16:44,878
Okay, well, best of luck
in all your future endeavors.

219
00:16:45,045 --> 00:16:46,463
MAN 1: Go. Goodbye.
MAN 2: Go.

220
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:48,799
MAN 1: Sorry about that.
MAN 2: Sorry about that.

221
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:54,555
Oh, my gosh. Are you okay?

222
00:16:55,556 --> 00:16:59,268
It was a drumstick.
It was laying loose in the aisle.

223
00:16:59,435 --> 00:17:02,146
-Somebody call an ambulance.
JIMMY: No, you don't need to.

224
00:17:03,188 --> 00:17:04,773
I don't need--

225
00:17:04,982 --> 00:17:06,608
[GROANS]

226
00:17:07,067 --> 00:17:09,820
Yes, an ambulance.
That's a good idea.

227
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:14,783
You guys have
liability insurance, right?

228
00:17:17,453 --> 00:17:19,038
KEVIN:
To our Four Corners strategy.

229
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:20,456
PAIGE: Cheers to that.
KIM: Cheers.

230
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:23,125
Mm.

231
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:26,712
I'm not saying this to rush you,
I have a 2:45 tee time at Four Hills...

232
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:28,547
...so don't let me get long-winded.

233
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:31,216
I've heard the water gets tricky
on the back nine there.

234
00:17:31,383 --> 00:17:33,343
You heard right.
I didn't know you played.

235
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:36,305
Well, growing up where I did,
there was nothing else to do.

236
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:39,641
We ought to be having
this meeting out on the fairway.

237
00:17:39,808 --> 00:17:41,852
I think Kim has a lot to cover.

238
00:17:42,019 --> 00:17:45,355
Speaking of which, sorry, but I gotta ask.

239
00:17:45,522 --> 00:17:46,899
I got a friend, Billy Gatwood.

240
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:50,277
He's a driller,
has a small operation over near Farwell.

241
00:17:50,444 --> 00:17:52,863
Anyway, poor bastard's tangled up
in some kind of...

242
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:55,282
...interstate wrangle between
Texas and New Mexico.

243
00:17:55,449 --> 00:17:58,202
Now, I can't make heads or tails of it,
and neither can he.

244
00:17:58,368 --> 00:18:01,580
His lawyer was a local guy,
completely over his head.

245
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:04,083
So Billy's fired the guy,
but he doesn't know...

246
00:18:04,249 --> 00:18:06,794
...whether to shit or wind his watch,
pardon my French.

247
00:18:08,295 --> 00:18:10,756
Anyhow, I told him about
the job you're doing for us.

248
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:13,467
-I know he'd love to talk to you.
-I suggest Big Sky.

249
00:18:13,634 --> 00:18:17,262
It's got the beauty of Montana, but you
don't have to wait in the lift lines.

250
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:20,140
Oh, wow,
I can't tell you how flattering that is.

251
00:18:20,307 --> 00:18:24,812
Remember, Kim's got her hands full
with Utah and Colorado.

252
00:18:25,521 --> 00:18:29,108
As far as I'm concerned, she's proven
she can field whatever we throw at her.

253
00:18:30,192 --> 00:18:33,112
Kevin, your faith in me is-- It's--

254
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:36,573
It means a lot, but when we first
started working together...

255
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:39,993
...I promised you Mesa Verde
would be my sole focus, and I meant it.

256
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,787
KEVIN: Sure, but I gotta--
HOWARD: Hey, there.

257
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:44,248
-I thought I saw some familiar faces.
-Howard.

258
00:18:44,414 --> 00:18:47,292
Kim, sit. I insist.

259
00:18:47,543 --> 00:18:48,752
HOWARD: Kevin.
KEVIN: Howard.

260
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:51,046
HOWARD:
Paige. Always wonderful to see you.

261
00:18:51,213 --> 00:18:54,091
-You too, Howard. How have you been?
-Fantastic. Thank you.

262
00:18:54,258 --> 00:18:56,093
All is well with the expansion?

263
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:59,221
You got that branch approved
on your original timeline after all.

264
00:18:59,388 --> 00:19:01,348
We did, thanks to Ms. Wexler here.

265
00:19:01,515 --> 00:19:03,892
Kim's one of the best.
You're lucky to have her.

266
00:19:04,059 --> 00:19:05,269
She sure is, we sure are.

267
00:19:05,435 --> 00:19:08,230
Seems like just yesterday,
she was logging hours in doc review.

268
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:09,398
Heh.

269
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:11,900
HOWARD: Always a pleasure to see
one of our protégés...

270
00:19:12,067 --> 00:19:14,194
...spread her wings
and leave the nest.

271
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:18,699
Well, I'll get out of your hair.
Best of luck to all of you.

272
00:19:18,866 --> 00:19:20,659
You too, Howard.

273
00:19:22,703 --> 00:19:25,956
I appreciate we got you all to ourselves,
but Billy just needs a consultation.

274
00:19:26,123 --> 00:19:28,584
I'm so sorry, um, but, uh--

275
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:30,502
Would you excuse me
for just a moment?

276
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:32,087
KEVIN:
Sure.

277
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:57,321
I've had the salmon and filet.
If you like sea scallops, they're fantastic.

278
00:19:57,487 --> 00:20:00,199
-Kim, hello again.
-Howard, sit. I insist.

279
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:03,285
Sorry to interrupt.
I just needed to give Howard something.

280
00:20:05,954 --> 00:20:10,125
Folks, this is Kim Wexler,
a former member of our firm.

281
00:20:10,292 --> 00:20:12,419
Kim, this is the team
from O'Malley Industries.

282
00:20:12,586 --> 00:20:14,046
Oh, of course. I remember Lauren.

283
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:16,548
Good to see you.
This is Jack Sweet, our new CFO.

284
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:17,716
-Hello.
-Pleasure.

285
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:19,384
KIM:
Nice to see you too. Henry. Nick.

286
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:22,179
MARIE: Marie Austin. Good to meet you.
KIM: Nice to meet you.

287
00:20:22,804 --> 00:20:24,848
Good to see all of you.

288
00:20:25,015 --> 00:20:27,184
Have a wonderful lunch, Howard.

289
00:20:31,104 --> 00:20:33,023
-Sorry to hold things up.
-Not at all.

290
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:36,068
Okay, Kevin, if you want to give me
Mr. Gatwood's number...

291
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:38,111
...I'd be happy to speak to him.

292
00:20:38,278 --> 00:20:39,321
That's great.

293
00:20:39,488 --> 00:20:43,659
Once I understand, I'll put him with a firm
that'll take very good care of him.

294
00:20:43,825 --> 00:20:45,327
I leave it in your capable hands.

295
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:47,496
Great. Okay, Utah.

296
00:20:47,663 --> 00:20:49,957
The good news is
the filing requirements...

297
00:20:50,123 --> 00:20:52,876
...are very similar
to what we submitted for Arizona.

298
00:20:53,043 --> 00:20:56,630
KEVIN: Thanks again. I'll let Billy know
you'll be calling. We'll talk tee time soon.

299
00:20:56,713 --> 00:20:58,090
KIM: Sounds good.
PAIGE: See you soon.

300
00:20:58,173 --> 00:20:59,591
KIM:
Bye.

301
00:21:00,217 --> 00:21:01,593
MAN:
Here.

302
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:12,187
-What the hell is this?
-I think it's pretty self-explanatory.

303
00:21:14,398 --> 00:21:16,900
Look, Howard, you were very generous
when I left HHM.

304
00:21:17,067 --> 00:21:19,152
It never sat right
that you covered my loans.

305
00:21:19,319 --> 00:21:20,779
Seemed to sit right at the time.

306
00:21:21,405 --> 00:21:24,950
I appreciate the gift, but now I'm able
to afford it, I wanna pay you back.

307
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:27,035
-Well, you appreciate the gift.
-Yes, I do.

308
00:21:27,202 --> 00:21:30,664
You know what I'm doing in there?
Take a guess.

309
00:21:30,956 --> 00:21:32,207
I'm doing damage control.

310
00:21:32,374 --> 00:21:36,044
I'm doing it three meals a day for
the past two weeks with every client.

311
00:21:36,211 --> 00:21:38,797
I am busting my ass trying to repair
the reputation of the firm...

312
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:41,174
...after you and Jimmy
dragged it through the mud.

313
00:21:41,341 --> 00:21:43,510
I did everything in my power
to defend my client.

314
00:21:43,677 --> 00:21:46,221
-Is that what you're calling it?
-That's the job, Howard.

315
00:21:47,514 --> 00:21:51,226
It was very convenient for you to
ignore Chuck's illness when it suited you.

316
00:21:51,768 --> 00:21:55,022
I take you out of the mail room,
put you through law school, mentor you.

317
00:21:55,188 --> 00:21:58,233
You leave and stab me in the back,
that's my fault? I'm not cashing this.

318
00:22:01,611 --> 00:22:04,239
Kim, your debt is forgiven.

319
00:22:04,406 --> 00:22:06,950
But anything else, that's on you.

320
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:09,870
All Jimmy and I did
was show the situation for what it is.

321
00:22:10,037 --> 00:22:11,955
And if you're hiding that
from your clients...

322
00:22:12,122 --> 00:22:14,207
...well, Howard, that's on you.

and you can get me out of here?

511
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:26,525
All right. You can do it,
you got a deal.

512
00:41:28,068 --> 00:41:29,069
Okay.

513
00:41:29,236 --> 00:41:31,739
Go pick up trash. Go on.

514
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:51,175
What the hell's this?

515
00:41:53,177 --> 00:41:55,679
Resting. Uh, I hurt my back.

516
00:41:56,347 --> 00:41:57,806
Get up.

517
00:41:57,973 --> 00:42:00,351
Nope. My back's killing me.

518
00:42:00,518 --> 00:42:02,061
Suit yourself.

519
00:42:02,228 --> 00:42:03,646
You're not getting your hours.

520
00:42:03,812 --> 00:42:06,607
JIMMY: I'm pretty sure
you're gonna give me my hours.

521
00:42:06,774 --> 00:42:08,275
Oh, yeah?

522
00:42:08,526 --> 00:42:10,069
How do you figure that?

523
00:42:10,236 --> 00:42:13,155
Because if you don't,
I'm gonna sue you.

524
00:42:13,989 --> 00:42:17,701
Hate to break it to you, smart guy,
but you signed a waiver.

525
00:42:17,868 --> 00:42:19,828
I signed a waiver with the city.

526
00:42:19,995 --> 00:42:21,622
But I'm not suing the city.

527
00:42:21,789 --> 00:42:23,832
I'm suing you. Personally.

528
00:42:27,419 --> 00:42:28,754
You can't do that.

529
00:42:29,713 --> 00:42:31,215
Buddy....

530
00:42:34,176 --> 00:42:36,637
This is the land of the free
and home of the lawsuit.

531
00:42:36,804 --> 00:42:38,305
I sure as shooting can.

532
00:42:38,472 --> 00:42:39,723
You know what?

533
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:43,018
Uh, I think I'll bring that guy
in with me.

534
00:42:43,185 --> 00:42:45,229
Make it a class action thing.

535
00:42:45,396 --> 00:42:46,605
What's he got to do with it?

536
00:42:46,772 --> 00:42:50,192
You knowingly prevented him
from visiting his child in the hospital.

537
00:42:50,359 --> 00:42:54,572
If that isn't intentional infliction
of emotional distress, what is?

538
00:42:54,738 --> 00:42:56,490
That's crazy.

539
00:42:56,657 --> 00:42:57,992
Crazy hasn't even started.

540
00:42:58,158 --> 00:43:01,829
I can also sue you for failure to approve
community service hours.

541
00:43:01,996 --> 00:43:06,083
That's a direct violation of your duties
as an agent of the state of New Mexico.

542
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:07,668
I'm only doing my job.

543
00:43:07,835 --> 00:43:11,130
And just for tickles,
maybe I throw in failure to treat...

544
00:43:11,297 --> 00:43:13,674
...and mitigate damages
suffered by me...

545
00:43:13,841 --> 00:43:15,843
...due to injuries sustained
under your watch.

546
00:43:16,010 --> 00:43:17,428
-Injury?
-My back.

547
00:43:17,595 --> 00:43:20,097
You're full of shit. The waiver clearly--

548
00:43:20,264 --> 00:43:23,559
That waiver's gonna make
Swiss cheese look solid.

549
00:43:23,726 --> 00:43:27,271
And in a personal lawsuit,
it's a fart in the wind.

550
00:43:28,897 --> 00:43:31,358
You're never gonna win that.

551
00:43:31,525 --> 00:43:33,277
Maybe. Maybe not.

552
00:43:33,444 --> 00:43:35,738
In order to find out,
we gotta do some math.

553
00:43:35,904 --> 00:43:38,657
Let's see, a lawyer's gonna cost you
about 90 bucks an hour.

554
00:43:38,824 --> 00:43:42,369
You're looking at eight to 12 months
of litigation, minimum.

555
00:43:43,329 --> 00:43:45,205
-I'll represent myself.
-Great.

556
00:43:45,372 --> 00:43:46,999
Bring it on. You got a car?

557
00:43:47,166 --> 00:43:48,959
You got a house? A pension?

558
00:43:49,126 --> 00:43:51,045
Kiss it all goodbye.

559
00:43:51,211 --> 00:43:53,547
Look, out here you might be
King Douche-nozzle.

560
00:43:53,714 --> 00:43:57,885
But in court you are little people.

561
00:43:58,052 --> 00:44:01,430
The judge and I, we'll gladly spend
the next five years in the courtroom.

562
00:44:01,597 --> 00:44:05,100
But for you, it's expensive.
It's very, very expensive.

563
00:44:05,267 --> 00:44:07,227
It's third-mortgage expensive.

564
00:44:07,394 --> 00:44:08,646
So...

565
00:44:08,812 --> 00:44:11,398
...I'm offering you a simple choice.

566
00:44:11,565 --> 00:44:14,652
You go to your wife, explain to her
you're about to lose your job...

567
00:44:14,818 --> 00:44:17,821
...your pension,
whatever pinhole of a reputation...

568
00:44:17,988 --> 00:44:21,200
...you've got at the bowling alley
on Glow-ball Sundays. Or...

569
00:44:21,408 --> 00:44:24,370
...let my friend here
visit his sick daughter in the hospital...

570
00:44:24,536 --> 00:44:27,414
...and you can let me rest my back
on this sacred...

571
00:44:27,581 --> 00:44:30,501
...now litter-free, New Mexico soil.

572
00:44:30,876 --> 00:44:34,171
Oh, and we keep our hours.

573
00:44:40,678 --> 00:44:42,096
Fine.

574
00:44:43,472 --> 00:44:45,265
Asshole.

575
00:44:49,561 --> 00:44:51,355
Well, go on.

576
00:44:51,730 --> 00:44:53,399
Get out of here.

577
00:44:55,317 --> 00:44:57,027
Hey, man.

578
00:44:57,194 --> 00:45:00,447
That was some
Jedi mind shit right there.

579
00:45:05,702 --> 00:45:08,705
Best 700 I done ever spent.

580
00:45:13,669 --> 00:45:15,671
Here you go. I'm out.

581
00:45:21,260 --> 00:45:22,678
Yeah, yeah.

582
00:45:22,845 --> 00:45:24,763
Yo, I'm on my way. Yeah, yeah.

583
00:45:37,568 --> 00:45:39,570

[SIGHS]

585
00:46:26,408 --> 00:46:29,077
MIKE: <i>I've got a problem</i>
<i>I think you can help me with.</i>

586
00:46:29,244 --> 00:46:31,830
<i>I've got cash I can't spend.</i>

587
00:46:32,289 --> 00:46:35,125
About $200,000.

588
00:46:35,751 --> 00:46:39,713
If anything happens to me,
my family will never see it.

589
00:46:41,507 --> 00:46:43,383
Now, it seems to me...

590
00:46:43,550 --> 00:46:47,554
...you opened this place
to solve a similar problem.

591
00:46:48,639 --> 00:46:51,517
And you think that solution...

592
00:46:51,683 --> 00:46:53,268
...could be applied to you.

593
00:46:53,602 --> 00:46:55,354
As a one-time arrangement.

594
00:46:58,232 --> 00:47:02,611
It would be unwise for us to be
publicly associated, wouldn't you agree?

595
00:47:04,196 --> 00:47:05,781
Because of the Salamancas.

596
00:47:05,948 --> 00:47:07,783
If they were to take notice...

597
00:47:08,283 --> 00:47:09,868
...there would be consequences.

598
00:47:10,035 --> 00:47:11,411
For both of us.

599
00:47:16,124 --> 00:47:18,168
I'm thinking a paper transaction.

600
00:47:18,961 --> 00:47:20,128
Even so.

601
00:47:23,799 --> 00:47:25,425
Perhaps there is a way.

602
00:47:26,510 --> 00:47:30,472
One with a degree more difficulty.

603
00:47:31,098 --> 00:47:33,058
But one I may be able to arrange.

604
00:47:35,269 --> 00:47:38,730
Would 20 percent
overcome this difficulty?

605
00:47:40,482 --> 00:47:42,776
I would not take money
from your family.
