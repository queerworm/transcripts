You're good.

532
00:46:31,288 --> 00:46:33,415
-See you, Marty.
-See you, Jimmy.

533
00:46:33,832 --> 00:46:36,210
MAN: Ready for me?
-Okay, next.

534
00:46:43,509 --> 00:46:44,718
Howard?

535
00:46:48,138 --> 00:46:49,389
Everything okay?

536
00:46:51,183 --> 00:46:52,559
Everything's fine.

537
00:46:53,352 --> 00:46:54,520
And how are you doing?

538
00:46:55,312 --> 00:46:57,815
I've been better.
I'm heading up to the DA's office

539
00:46:58,106 --> 00:47:00,943
for my PPD check-in.
So, you know....

540
00:47:01,985 --> 00:47:02,820
Yeah.

541
00:47:03,362 --> 00:47:04,321
Anyway....

542
00:47:10,369 --> 00:47:12,079
[Howard exhales sharply]

543
00:47:12,830 --> 00:47:14,915
You sure you're okay?

544
00:47:17,125 --> 00:47:19,211
I'm supposed to be in court...

545
00:47:20,003 --> 00:47:21,588
in about 25 minutes.

546
00:47:21,755 --> 00:47:23,841
-Big case?
-Not particularly.

547
00:47:25,467 --> 00:47:26,635
So, what's up?

548
00:47:28,136 --> 00:47:31,890
Nothing. Just.... [chuckles]

549
00:47:33,892 --> 00:47:35,519
You ever have insomnia?

550
00:47:36,478 --> 00:47:37,479
Not really.

551
00:47:38,939 --> 00:47:40,774
Wouldn't wish it on the worst enemy.

552
00:47:46,238 --> 00:47:49,032
-Don't they have pills for that?
-[chuckles]

553
00:47:51,076 --> 00:47:53,287
I'm-- I'm sorry, I gotta ask.

554
00:47:54,580 --> 00:47:57,249
Uh, what's--? What's eating you?

555
00:47:59,084 --> 00:48:00,127
Jimmy.

556
00:48:06,425 --> 00:48:07,885
I think I've shared enough.

557
00:48:08,635 --> 00:48:10,053
More than enough.

558
00:48:12,681 --> 00:48:14,600
Let's leave it at that.

559
00:48:18,312 --> 00:48:19,271
I get it.

560
00:48:22,107 --> 00:48:26,778
You know what, Howard. You do yourself
a favor and you go see someone.

561
00:48:27,195 --> 00:48:31,116
I actually have the number of a shrink.
I got it for a client.

562
00:48:31,199 --> 00:48:33,160
He's supposed to be great.

563
00:48:33,410 --> 00:48:35,078
I think, um....

564
00:48:35,495 --> 00:48:37,706
Got it right here, actually.

565
00:48:37,873 --> 00:48:40,250
Uh, thanks, but I'm already
seeing someone.

566
00:48:42,085 --> 00:48:44,129
-Really?
-Twice a week.

567
00:48:46,298 --> 00:48:47,549
Is he any good?

568
00:48:48,967 --> 00:48:50,010
Yes.

569
00:48:51,470 --> 00:48:52,721
[sighs]

570
00:48:54,890 --> 00:48:57,476
-Good seeing you, Howard.
-You too.

571
00:49:23,126 --> 00:49:25,128
[toilet flushes]

572
00:49:49,778 --> 00:49:53,073
So where were we?

573
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:54,741
Community service.

574
00:49:55,450 --> 00:49:57,536
Community service. Right.

575
00:49:59,329 --> 00:50:02,249
-Looks like you completed your hours.
-Yep.

576
00:50:02,374 --> 00:50:04,209
Your PPD fees are up-to-date.

577
00:50:05,377 --> 00:50:08,380
And you've recently procured
lawful employment at...?

578
00:50:08,505 --> 00:50:09,506
CC Mobile.

579
00:50:10,257 --> 00:50:11,299
Address?

580
00:50:12,175 --> 00:50:15,095
8351 Louisiana Boulevard.

581
00:50:15,262 --> 00:50:18,098
8351 Louisiana.

582
00:50:19,433 --> 00:50:21,101
How many hours a week?

583
00:50:21,810 --> 00:50:24,938
This week, uh, 31. But I'll pick up more.

584
00:50:25,564 --> 00:50:28,066
-Next month, bring pay stubs.
-Will do.

585
00:50:29,609 --> 00:50:32,404
Are you associating
with any known criminals?

586
00:50:33,155 --> 00:50:34,156
No.

587
00:50:35,991 --> 00:50:36,867
All right.

588
00:50:37,659 --> 00:50:39,202
Month two looks good.

589
00:50:40,662 --> 00:50:43,832
Have you thought about what
you're gonna do once your PPD is up?

590
00:50:44,958 --> 00:50:46,543
I have some plans.

591
00:50:48,170 --> 00:50:49,129
Okay.

592
00:50:50,213 --> 00:50:51,339
Such as?

593
00:50:53,925 --> 00:50:57,721
Until then, I'll show up here
every second Monday of the month...

594
00:50:57,888 --> 00:50:59,181
...like clockwork.

595
00:50:59,306 --> 00:51:01,725
I'm gonna keep my job
at the cell phone store...

596
00:51:02,267 --> 00:51:06,730
...and in nine months and 24 days,
I will get my law license back.

597
00:51:06,897 --> 00:51:09,816
My partner and I, we'll get a new office.

598
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:11,818
It'll be like it was...

599
00:51:12,986 --> 00:51:14,362
...but bigger and better.

600
00:51:16,281 --> 00:51:18,200
Everything will be better.

601
00:51:18,366 --> 00:51:21,161
I'm gonna have more clients,
I'm gonna win more cases.

602
00:51:21,328 --> 00:51:23,038
I'm gonna be a damn good lawyer.

603
00:51:23,205 --> 00:51:25,332
-And people are gonna know about it.
-Okay.

604
00:51:26,583 --> 00:51:29,086
So...lawyer.

605
00:51:31,713 --> 00:51:32,631
Yeah.

606
00:51:33,757 --> 00:51:34,758
Lawyer.
