telling me is...

590
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:23,814
It's problematic.

00:30:38,962 --> 00:30:42,341
Yeah, why?

770
00:30:49,139 --> 00:30:51,057
RUSSO:

771
00:30:49,139 --> 00:30:51,057
So, what'd we miss?

772
00:31:13,079 --> 00:31:16,834
This is the son's room,

773
00:31:13,079 --> 00:31:16,834
Warren.

774
00:31:16,834 --> 00:31:18,585
Twelve years old.

775
00:31:34,476 --> 00:31:36,436
Jo Jo's room.

776
00:31:37,688 --> 00:31:40,357
KIM:

777
00:31:37,688 --> 00:31:40,357
She's 7.

778
00:31:49,282 --> 00:31:51,702
All right,

779
00:31:49,282 --> 00:31:51,702
you wanted me to crack,

780
00:31:51,702 --> 00:31:53,453
mission accomplished.

781
00:31:53,453 --> 00:31:56,289
But I'm telling you,

782
00:31:53,453 --> 00:31:56,289
my client didn't do this.

783
00:31:56,289 --> 00:31:59,167
Varga was outside the night

784
00:31:56,289 --> 00:31:59,167
the family disappeared.

785
00:31:59,167 --> 00:32:00,419
That is a fact.

786
00:32:00,419 --> 00:32:01,961
Advocate for the guy

787
00:32:00,419 --> 00:32:01,961
all you want

788
00:32:01,961 --> 00:32:04,297
after we get these people

789
00:32:01,961 --> 00:32:04,297
back safe.

790
00:32:04,297 --> 00:32:07,384
In the meantime, help us.

791
00:32:07,384 --> 00:32:08,761
Where's the doll?

792
00:32:08,761 --> 00:32:10,554
Where's the what?

793
00:32:10,554 --> 00:32:12,972
Uh, got little shoes,

794
00:32:12,972 --> 00:32:15,058
bunch of clothes,

795
00:32:12,972 --> 00:32:15,058
table and chairs, hairbrush,

796
00:32:15,058 --> 00:32:17,310
but where's the doll

797
00:32:15,058 --> 00:32:17,310
that goes with this?

798
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:20,647
In every picture of this girl,

799
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:20,647
she's holding the same doll.

800
00:32:20,647 --> 00:32:23,567
So where's the doll?

801
00:32:20,647 --> 00:32:23,567
What does it matter?

802
00:32:23,567 --> 00:32:25,569
Doll is gone, girl is gone,

803
00:32:25,569 --> 00:32:27,780
which means doll and girl

804
00:32:25,569 --> 00:32:27,780
are most likely together,

805
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:29,782
which means--

806
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:29,782
I have no idea.

807
00:32:29,782 --> 00:32:32,659
JIMMY:

808
00:32:29,782 --> 00:32:32,659
Which means the kid wasn't

809
00:32:29,782 --> 00:32:32,659
dragged out of the house,

810
00:32:32,659 --> 00:32:34,578
ipso facto.

811
00:32:34,578 --> 00:32:36,371
Wait.

812
00:32:34,578 --> 00:32:36,371
What are you saying?

813
00:32:37,664 --> 00:32:40,417
Maybe the Kettlemans

814
00:32:37,664 --> 00:32:40,417
kidnapped themselves.

815
00:32:43,503 --> 00:32:44,880
That's it.

816
00:32:43,503 --> 00:32:44,880
You're done.

817
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,506
Let's go.

818
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,506
It makes perfect sense.

819
00:32:46,506 --> 00:32:48,550
How? Why would they do that?

820
00:32:48,550 --> 00:32:51,344
They stole

821
00:32:48,550 --> 00:32:51,344
million dollars plus, right?

822
00:32:51,344 --> 00:32:54,055
You wanna get away with

823
00:32:51,344 --> 00:32:54,055
that cash, what do you do?

824
00:32:54,055 --> 00:32:55,724
Run?

825
00:32:54,055 --> 00:32:55,724
No, you can't.

826
00:32:55,724 --> 00:32:58,435
If you run, everyone knows

827
00:32:55,724 --> 00:32:58,435
you're guilty.

828
00:32:58,435 --> 00:33:02,648
Ah. But if you're kidnapped,

829
00:32:58,435 --> 00:33:02,648
you're a victim. Right?

830
00:33:02,648 --> 00:33:05,442
They staged this

831
00:33:02,648 --> 00:33:05,442
to throw everyone off.

832
00:33:05,442 --> 00:33:07,360
You guys are looking

833
00:33:05,442 --> 00:33:07,360
in the wrong place.

834
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:10,781
Who knows how many miles into

835
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:10,781
Mexico or Canada they could be?

836
00:33:10,781 --> 00:33:13,241
You gotta put the word out.

837
00:33:13,241 --> 00:33:16,954
Oh, come on, you don't think

838
00:33:13,241 --> 00:33:16,954
it's possible I'm right?

839
00:33:16,954 --> 00:33:19,331
It's possible.

840
00:33:16,954 --> 00:33:19,331
Unlikely.

841
00:33:19,331 --> 00:33:22,041
JIMMY: Unlikely?

842
00:33:19,331 --> 00:33:22,041
All their cars are here.

843
00:33:22,041 --> 00:33:25,128
There's no record of a taxi

844
00:33:22,041 --> 00:33:25,128
or car service to the house.

845
00:33:25,128 --> 00:33:27,756
They didn't get on any planes

846
00:33:25,128 --> 00:33:27,756
or buses or trains.

847
00:33:27,756 --> 00:33:31,217
You checked all that?

848
00:33:27,756 --> 00:33:31,217
Yes. The doll, it's not news.

849
00:33:31,217 --> 00:33:33,679
We saw it was missing.

850
00:33:31,217 --> 00:33:33,679
So where is it?

851
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:35,347
The girl was scared,

852
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:35,347
crying.

853
00:33:35,347 --> 00:33:39,434
Bad guy lets the kid

854
00:33:35,347 --> 00:33:39,434
take the doll to shut her up.

855
00:33:39,434 --> 00:33:42,646
What? You don't think

856
00:33:39,434 --> 00:33:42,646
that's possible?

857
00:33:43,897 --> 00:33:46,483
I need to talk to you,

858
00:33:43,897 --> 00:33:46,483
alone.

859
00:33:48,610 --> 00:33:51,822
I've gotta tell you something,

860
00:33:48,610 --> 00:33:51,822
and promise not to be upset.

861
00:33:51,822 --> 00:33:55,074
No way am I making that promise.

862
00:33:51,822 --> 00:33:55,074
I called the Kettlemans.

863
00:33:55,074 --> 00:33:57,786
After I hung up with you,

864
00:33:55,074 --> 00:33:57,786
I gave them a warning call.

865
00:33:57,786 --> 00:33:58,996
A warning call?

866
00:33:58,996 --> 00:34:00,580
I was worried my guy Varga

867
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:02,290
was going after their money,

868
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:02,290
and he was.

869
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:03,834
He was gonna rip them off.

870
00:34:03,834 --> 00:34:06,336
I deduced it

871
00:34:03,834 --> 00:34:06,336
from a conversation we had.

872
00:34:06,336 --> 00:34:08,254
It was lawyer-to-client,

873
00:34:06,336 --> 00:34:08,254
so there was,

874
00:34:08,254 --> 00:34:10,256
you know,

875
00:34:08,254 --> 00:34:10,256
confidentiality issues.

876
00:34:10,256 --> 00:34:14,386
But I called the Kettlemans

877
00:34:10,256 --> 00:34:14,386
anonymously to warn them.

878
00:34:14,386 --> 00:34:16,972
Anonymously? You did--?

879
00:34:14,386 --> 00:34:16,972
Oh, God, you didn't--?

880
00:34:16,972 --> 00:34:19,140
You didn't do

881
00:34:16,972 --> 00:34:19,140
the sex robot voice, did you?

882
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:21,267
I did, the tube

883
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:21,267
and the whole thing,

884
00:34:21,267 --> 00:34:24,354
which probably scared

885
00:34:21,267 --> 00:34:24,354
the living shit out of them,

886
00:34:24,354 --> 00:34:26,356
and they took off.

887
00:34:24,354 --> 00:34:26,356
Which, you know,

888
00:34:26,356 --> 00:34:28,400
file that under

889
00:34:26,356 --> 00:34:28,400
unintended consequences,

890
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:31,570
but you believe me now?

891
00:34:31,570 --> 00:34:33,363
Uh--

892
00:34:33,363 --> 00:34:36,157
Great.

893
00:34:33,363 --> 00:34:36,157
Now we have to find them.

894
00:34:36,157 --> 00:34:40,370
Or better yet,

895
00:34:36,157 --> 00:34:40,370
get the cops to let Varga go,

896
00:34:40,370 --> 00:34:43,999
because right now my ass is on

897
00:34:40,370 --> 00:34:43,999
the highway to the danger zone.

898
00:34:43,999 --> 00:34:46,543
Why are you in danger?

899
00:34:43,999 --> 00:34:46,543
Nacho Varga,

900
00:34:46,543 --> 00:34:50,589
he didn't kidnap the family,

901
00:34:46,543 --> 00:34:50,589
but he's a bad guy.

902
00:34:50,589 --> 00:34:52,215
He's a very bad guy,

903
00:34:52,215 --> 00:34:53,884
and if the cops

904
00:34:52,215 --> 00:34:53,884
keep pushing him

905
00:34:53,884 --> 00:34:56,219
they're gonna find something,

906
00:34:53,884 --> 00:34:56,219
and when that happens,

907
00:34:56,219 --> 00:34:58,972
Nacho blames me,

908
00:34:56,219 --> 00:34:58,972
and then his guys...

909
00:34:58,972 --> 00:35:01,140
turn me

910
00:34:58,972 --> 00:35:01,140
into a meat piñata.

911
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:02,601
Jimmy, tell the police.

912
00:35:02,601 --> 00:35:04,686
There's no way

913
00:35:02,601 --> 00:35:04,686
I'm gonna rat on this guy.

914
00:35:04,686 --> 00:35:06,813
I will never be safe.

915
00:35:06,813 --> 00:35:09,274
I have to convince

916
00:35:06,813 --> 00:35:09,274
the cops I'm right,

917
00:35:09,274 --> 00:35:10,650
get them to stop

918
00:35:09,274 --> 00:35:10,650
looking at Nacho

919
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:12,569
and catch the Kettlemans

920
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:12,569
on the run.

921
00:35:12,569 --> 00:35:14,237
And if they never

922
00:35:12,569 --> 00:35:14,237
catch them?

923
00:35:14,237 --> 00:35:17,866
The Kettlemans?

924
00:35:14,237 --> 00:35:17,866
You've met these people, right?

925
00:35:17,866 --> 00:35:19,910
They're not

926
00:35:17,866 --> 00:35:19,910
exactly masterminds.

927
00:35:19,910 --> 00:35:22,412
They will be caught

928
00:35:19,910 --> 00:35:22,412
if the cops are looking.

929
00:35:22,412 --> 00:35:24,372
So you tell them to,

930
00:35:22,412 --> 00:35:24,372
would you?

931
00:35:24,372 --> 00:35:26,792
The FBI too. I heard

932
00:35:24,372 --> 00:35:26,792
they're getting in on this.

933
00:35:26,792 --> 00:35:30,629
Why would the FBI listen to me?

934
00:35:26,792 --> 00:35:30,629
Hamlin. They'll listen to him.

935
00:35:30,629 --> 00:35:32,213
APD, at least.

936
00:35:32,213 --> 00:35:35,300
You talk to Howard,

937
00:35:32,213 --> 00:35:35,300
you explain things to him.

938
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:37,302
He has clout

939
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:37,302
with these people.

940
00:35:37,302 --> 00:35:39,178
What, is that a no, or...?

941
00:35:39,178 --> 00:35:41,848
Hamlin will never agree to it.

942
00:35:39,178 --> 00:35:41,848
The Kettlemans are our clients.

943
00:35:41,848 --> 00:35:43,516
This would mean

944
00:35:41,848 --> 00:35:43,516
incriminating them.

945
00:35:43,516 --> 00:35:46,436
You see? This is why

946
00:35:43,516 --> 00:35:46,436
people hate lawyers.

947
00:35:46,436 --> 00:35:49,940
It's Hamlin's call,

948
00:35:46,436 --> 00:35:49,940
and Hamlin will never agree.

949
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:53,192
And even if it were up to me,

950
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:53,192
you know I couldn't.

951
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:57,864
I'm sorry, I just--

952
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:57,864
I get it.

953
00:36:02,869 --> 00:36:05,038
Where are you going?

954
00:36:02,869 --> 00:36:05,038
I'm gonna go talk to Nacho,

955
00:36:05,038 --> 00:36:07,833
try to make him

956
00:36:05,038 --> 00:36:07,833
see reason.

957
00:36:07,833 --> 00:36:09,542
To beg.

958
00:36:17,843 --> 00:36:19,136
Come on.

959
00:36:19,136 --> 00:36:21,262
Come on.

960
00:36:30,313 --> 00:36:33,984
