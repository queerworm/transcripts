Oh, I got it.

512
00:35:02,141 --> 00:35:03,643
Hope that wasn't a bribe.

513
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:06,479
-Wow, that would be one sad bribe.
-Heh.

514
00:35:06,646 --> 00:35:08,022
Not on my salary.

515
00:35:08,189 --> 00:35:10,525
Do you have a minute
to discuss a case?

516
00:35:11,025 --> 00:35:13,903
Sure. I got two minutes.

517

you guys are reaching with this one.

518

Where have I heard that before?

519
00:35:19,325 --> 00:35:21,661
-Babineaux.
-Babineaux?

520
00:35:21,828 --> 00:35:23,079
Really?

521
00:35:23,246 --> 00:35:25,248
Doesn't seem like your kind of client.

522
00:35:25,414 --> 00:35:26,916
I disagree.

523
00:35:27,083 --> 00:35:29,585
To start with, the whole thing was
a misunderstanding.

524
00:35:30,336 --> 00:35:34,423
Pickpocket with a rap sheet
attacks a cop in broad daylight?

525
00:35:34,590 --> 00:35:36,134
That's a misunderstanding?

526
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:38,511
Uh, I would not call it an attack.

527
00:35:38,678 --> 00:35:41,139
Realistically,
we should be talking misdemeanor.

528
00:35:42,223 --> 00:35:44,142
It's battery on a PO.

529
00:35:44,308 --> 00:35:46,561
-That's 18 months plus a year--
-A bitch time.

530
00:35:46,727 --> 00:35:48,938
I know what you're asking for,
it's excessive.

531
00:35:49,981 --> 00:35:51,107
He has a prior.

532
00:35:51,274 --> 00:35:53,818
-The same officer arrested him--
-Three years ago.

533
00:35:53,985 --> 00:35:57,530
But Babineaux didn't recognize him.
He didn't even know he was a cop.

534
00:35:57,697 --> 00:36:00,158
He drove an unmarked car,
he was in plain clothes...

535
00:36:00,324 --> 00:36:02,535
...he had his back turned.

536

539
00:36:10,543 --> 00:36:12,879
You had five cases
where civilians were accused...

540
00:36:13,045 --> 00:36:14,839
...of physical force against officers.

541
00:36:15,006 --> 00:36:19,135
Not once were the defendants given
anything close to this kind of jail time.

542
00:36:19,302 --> 00:36:21,554
They weren't repeat offenders.

543
00:36:21,721 --> 00:36:23,431
<i>State v. Murphy.</i>

544
00:36:23,598 --> 00:36:25,558
Murphy was homeless.
He was off his meds--

545
00:36:25,725 --> 00:36:29,353
He headbutted a police officer.
He gave him a concussion.

546
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,522
Five months. Suspended.

547
00:36:31,689 --> 00:36:33,524
<i>State v. Karp,</i> five months.

548
00:36:33,691 --> 00:36:36,569
-Suspended. <i>State v. Brezovich.</i>
-You're not seriously compar--

549
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:39,322
-No jail time, two months' probation.
-No priors.

550
00:36:39,488 --> 00:36:42,992
Brezovich broke a cop's nose.

551
00:36:43,159 --> 00:36:45,161
This is unequal justice.

552
00:36:45,328 --> 00:36:48,247
In this case,
the officer was not injured at all.

553
00:36:48,414 --> 00:36:50,541
He was hit with a bag of sandwiches.

554
00:36:50,708 --> 00:36:53,002
How can you justify giving Babineaux
18 months?

555
00:36:53,169 --> 00:36:55,671
-Plus a year.
-He has no history of violence.

why you want anything to do with this.

On one side, I've got
a decorated police officer doing his job.

559
00:37:05,765 --> 00:37:09,143
On the other, you have a professional thief
who threw him to the ground.

560
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:12,939
And our only witness is
a scumbag, disbarred lawyer...

to criminals.

they're pushing for, I promise you that.
