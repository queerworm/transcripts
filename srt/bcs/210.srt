I ratfucked you.

513
00:44:30,701 --> 00:44:32,369
It was me.

514
00:44:33,337 --> 00:44:35,906
I would've made Nixon proud.

515
00:44:39,076 --> 00:44:42,379
I changed 1261 to 1216.

516
00:44:43,847 --> 00:44:45,315
It was me.

517
00:44:46,383 --> 00:44:50,087
It all went down exactly like you said.

518
00:44:50,220 --> 00:44:53,791
I mean, exactly.

519
00:44:54,058 --> 00:44:58,328
I doctored the copies, I paid the kid
at the shop to lie for me.

520
00:44:58,729 --> 00:45:05,235
It is insane how you got every detail
exactly right.

522
00:45:07,271 --> 00:45:09,273
So you can relax, okay?

523
00:45:09,406 --> 00:45:14,078
Because that brain of yours is chugging
along at a thousand percent efficiency.

524
00:45:15,479 --> 00:45:17,481
Are you telling the truth...

525
00:45:17,915 --> 00:45:20,451
...or are you just trying to...

526
00:45:20,851 --> 00:45:23,854
-...make me feel better?
-I am saying it to make you feel better.

527
00:45:23,987 --> 00:45:26,490
I sure as shit wouldn't be telling you
otherwise.

528
00:45:27,224 --> 00:45:28,459
But, yes...

529
00:45:29,126 --> 00:45:30,727
...it's the truth.

530
00:45:31,962 --> 00:45:34,465
You'd go to such lengths
to humiliate me?

531
00:45:34,798 --> 00:45:36,900
I did it for Kim!

532
00:45:37,868 --> 00:45:40,771
She worked her butt off
to get Mesa Verde...

533
00:45:40,904 --> 00:45:44,875
...while you and Howard sat around
sipping Scotch and chortling.

More like Scrooge & Marley.

Kim deserves Mesa Verde, not you,
not HHM.

536
00:45:52,416 --> 00:45:55,018
She earned it and she needs it.

537
00:45:55,185 --> 00:45:57,221
I did it to help her.

538
00:45:57,354 --> 00:46:00,190
But I honestly didn't think
it would hurt you so bad.

539
00:46:00,324 --> 00:46:04,027
I thought you'd say, "Oh, crap, I made
a mistake," and go on with your life...

540
00:46:04,194 --> 00:46:09,032
...like a normal person. But oh, no!

So can I tell Howard you're not quitting,
or retiring, or whatever?

543
00:46:33,223 --> 00:46:36,560
Can we take all this shit down
off the walls?

544
00:46:41,532 --> 00:46:43,867
I'm gonna go call Howard.

546
00:46:47,804 --> 00:46:51,875
You do realize you just confessed
to a felony?

547
00:46:52,342 --> 00:46:54,011
I guess.

548
00:46:54,278 --> 00:46:56,413
