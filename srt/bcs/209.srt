Uh, yes. Can you give us the address
of the proposed Scottsdale branch again?

57
00:08:03,716 --> 00:08:08,988
Certainly. It's 1216 Rosella Drive,
Scottsdale, Arizona, 85262.

58
00:08:09,121 --> 00:08:13,092
1216. Okay, because the application
I'm looking at today...

-1261.

you'll see that 1216 is correct.
