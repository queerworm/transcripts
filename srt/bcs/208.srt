No. Not like this.

But we learned about
fractions in school.

You did? What fractions?

519
00:44:10,414 --> 00:44:15,119
Half inch, quarter inch,
eighth inch, sixteenth inch.

Because Pop-Pop's a grown-up.

I made marks
every three-quarter inch.

548

Then Pop-Pop put a piece of wood down
so he doesn't ruin his table.
