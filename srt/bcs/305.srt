Just because
you don't see swinging dicks...

a boy fish from a girl fish.

00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:55,068
What happened after
the defendant smashed this tape?

339
00:19:55,235 --> 00:19:57,946
-Mr. Brightbill and I--
-That's the private investigator...

340
00:19:58,113 --> 00:20:00,324
-...that Charles hired?
-That's correct.

341
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:04,494
He and I were concerned that
Jimmy might strike his brother.

342
00:20:04,661 --> 00:20:06,079
So that's when we stepped in.

343
00:20:06,246 --> 00:20:07,831
-Thank you, Mr. Hamlin.
-Certainly.

344

[CLEARS THROAT]

348
00:20:22,429 --> 00:20:26,350
You testified you've known my client
for some time.

349
00:20:26,516 --> 00:20:27,851
How long exactly?

350
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:29,937
Nearly 10 years.

351
00:20:30,103 --> 00:20:32,105
How did you come to know him?

352
00:20:32,272 --> 00:20:34,942
His brother asked to hire him
in the mail room at our firm.

353
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:37,110
-And you did?
-Yes.

354
00:20:37,694 --> 00:20:39,404
What was your opinion of him then?

355
00:20:41,156 --> 00:20:42,783
I thought...

356
00:20:44,493 --> 00:20:46,578
...he had a lot of get up and go.

357
00:20:46,787 --> 00:20:50,207
-He was a hard worker.
-You had a nickname for him, didn't you?

358
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:52,459
"Charlie Hustle."

359
00:20:52,626 --> 00:20:54,419
Charlie Hustle?

360
00:20:54,586 --> 00:20:57,089
How'd you feel when you found out
he'd become a lawyer?

361
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:59,716
Surprised.
He had put himself through law school...

362
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:02,761
...and taken the bar exam
without telling any of the partners.

363
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:04,054
Even Charles.

364
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:08,100
He bootstrapped his way into a law
degree while working in your mail room.

365
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:10,602
Did you consider taking him on
as an associate?

366
00:21:10,852 --> 00:21:12,145
We did.

367
00:21:12,729 --> 00:21:15,148
-Briefly.
-Sounds like you didn't hire him.

368
00:21:15,315 --> 00:21:17,776
Why not? With that kind of grit?

369
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:21,613
The partners decided it would be best
to avoid the appearance of nepotism.

370
00:21:22,489 --> 00:21:25,575
We felt hiring Jimmy
might damage morale.

371
00:21:26,326 --> 00:21:28,120
Nepotism.

372
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:30,580
Your firm is
Hamlin Hamlin & McGill, right?

373
00:21:31,415 --> 00:21:33,333
Who's the other Hamlin?

374
00:21:35,627 --> 00:21:37,170
My father.

375
00:21:41,258 --> 00:21:45,053
Which partner was the
most concerned with nepotism?

376
00:21:45,262 --> 00:21:47,306
Charles McGill.

377
00:21:47,848 --> 00:21:50,225
-So Jimmy's own brother blocked him?
ALLEY: Objection.

378
00:21:50,392 --> 00:21:53,687
How are the hiring practices
of Hamlin Hamlin McGill relevant here?

379
00:21:53,895 --> 00:21:57,566
It's relevant to understand
the relationship between these brothers.

380
00:21:59,109 --> 00:22:02,404
We'll give you some leeway,
Ms. Wexler...

381
00:22:02,571 --> 00:22:05,741
...but don't stray. Charles McGill
is not the subject of this hearing.

382
00:22:05,949 --> 00:22:07,534
Thank you.

383
00:22:08,201 --> 00:22:11,621
Did Jimmy know his brother was the one
that prevented you from hiring him?

384
00:22:11,788 --> 00:22:14,207
HOWARD:
No. He did not.

385
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:17,753
Eventually,
he was hired by the firm of Davis & Main.

386
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:21,131
I'd be happy to say more
about that if you'd like.

387
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:24,009
No. Thank you.

388
00:22:24,176 --> 00:22:27,554
When Charles' condition appeared,
Jimmy took care of him, didn't he?

389
00:22:28,346 --> 00:22:29,848
I believe so.

390
00:22:30,432 --> 00:22:34,895
Jimmy was struggling to build his solo
law practice, yet every day, without fail...

391
00:22:35,062 --> 00:22:38,023
...he brought his brother food,
supplies...

392
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:40,484
...even his favorite newspapers.
Isn't that right?

393
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:41,943
He did.

394
00:22:42,819 --> 00:22:46,281
KIM: Could you speak to the terms
of Charles' leave of absence?

395
00:22:46,615 --> 00:22:47,783
You know I can't.

396
00:22:47,949 --> 00:22:49,951
It was an FMLA leave.

397
00:22:50,118 --> 00:22:51,912
Anything more is confidential.

398
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:54,247
You can confirm it
was due to mental illness?

399
00:22:54,456 --> 00:22:57,459
Objection. Charles McGill's
mental health isn't at issue.

400
00:22:57,626 --> 00:23:01,379
This is a smear job on the State Bar's
upcoming witness. Nothing more.

401
00:23:01,546 --> 00:23:03,423
This is not a competency hearing.

402
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:05,801
Mr. Hamlin
is not a psychiatric professional.

403
00:23:05,967 --> 00:23:09,679
Do you have any questions that would
be more germane to his experience?

404
00:23:10,305 --> 00:23:11,515
No.

405
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:13,683
I have nothing further.

CHAIRMAN:
The witness is excused.

407
00:23:28,365 --> 00:23:31,952
At this time, the State Bar would like
to enter Exhibit 5 into evidence.

408
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:35,539
-We ask Charles' recording be played.
-Respectfully renewing my objection.

409
00:23:35,705 --> 00:23:39,084
Probative value of playing this
is outweighed by how prejudicial it is.

410
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:42,879
All due respect, but the State Bar
feels this is fundamental to hear.

411
00:23:43,088 --> 00:23:46,216
Don't wanna leave any question
as to the intentions of both parties.

00:29:27,015 --> 00:29:28,016
I had a suspicion...

493
00:29:28,183 --> 00:29:31,478
...my brother had tampered with
documents in a case I was working on.

Now, why would he do that?

-Doesn't sound particularly brotherly.
-I believe his hope was the documents...

00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:41,738
...would cause the client to become
disillusioned with my representation...

00:30:06,721 --> 00:30:10,141
Objection. Witness has admitted
there's no corroborating evidence...

507
00:30:10,308 --> 00:30:12,018
...the supposed crime even occurred.

508
00:30:12,101 --> 00:30:14,687
I'd like to hear what he has to say.

509
00:30:15,855 --> 00:30:17,357
We're going to continue.

510
00:30:17,524 --> 00:30:21,277
We'll extend you the same latitude
on cross, Ms. Wexler.

511
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:23,780
Go on, Mr. McGill.

512
00:30:23,947 --> 00:30:26,908
Without physical evidence,
I felt that a recorded confession...

513
00:30:27,075 --> 00:30:29,035
...if I could get one, was my best bet.

514
00:30:29,702 --> 00:30:32,205
On its own, I knew the tape
would be somewhat flimsy...

515
00:30:32,372 --> 00:30:35,875
...but it was a start.
A foundation for a more ironclad case.

516
00:30:37,001 --> 00:30:41,047
I suppose Jimmy must have felt the tape
was decisive evidence on its own.

517
00:30:41,214 --> 00:30:43,132
Otherwise, he wouldn't have broken in
to destroy it.

518
00:30:43,299 --> 00:30:45,134
Objection. More speculation.

519
00:30:45,301 --> 00:30:47,053
How can he know
what was going on in Jimmy's head?

520
00:30:47,262 --> 00:30:50,348
Sustained. We just need to hear
what happened, Mr. McGill.

521
00:30:50,515 --> 00:30:52,267
I-- I apologize.

522
00:30:52,433 --> 00:30:55,311
I recorded my brother
to build a case against him.

523
00:30:55,478 --> 00:30:58,606
At the time, would you say
you were in possession of your faculties?

524
00:30:58,815 --> 00:31:00,149
All due respect...

525
00:31:00,316 --> 00:31:02,861
...but you do sound somewhat unhinged
on the recording.

526
00:31:03,027 --> 00:31:04,279
Yes, I understand that.

527
00:31:04,487 --> 00:31:07,991
But what you heard was theater.
A performance. Play-acting.

528
00:31:08,992 --> 00:31:13,454
I exaggerated the symptoms
of my disease to extract the truth.

529
00:31:13,663 --> 00:31:15,957
Can we talk about your disease
for a moment?

530
00:31:16,124 --> 00:31:18,459
I'd like everybody
to be on the same page about it.

531
00:31:18,626 --> 00:31:21,713
Of course.
It is sometimes referred to as EHS.

532
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,840
Electromagnetic hypersensitivity.

533
00:31:24,507 --> 00:31:27,844
I describe it as an acute allergy
to electromagnetism.

534
00:31:28,428 --> 00:31:30,680
It's not a common condition, is it?

535
00:31:30,847 --> 00:31:33,057
I know it sounds strange. I do.

536
00:31:33,224 --> 00:31:36,311
But 30 years ago,
no one had heard of peanut allergies.

537
00:31:36,519 --> 00:31:38,062
But you admit that no one....

538
00:31:38,229 --> 00:31:40,690
No doctor has ever diagnosed you.

539
00:31:40,857 --> 00:31:44,694
AIDS was not identified properly until 1981.

540
00:31:44,861 --> 00:31:47,697
HIV wasn't known
as the cause until '83.

541
00:31:47,864 --> 00:31:51,075
These things take time to unravel,
even for doctors.

542
00:31:51,284 --> 00:31:54,495
Would you say that your illness
affects your ability to think clearly?

543
00:31:54,662 --> 00:31:56,831
No, it affects me physically.

544
00:31:56,998 --> 00:32:00,168
It causes me great pain.
However, I'm perfectly lucid.

545
00:32:00,335 --> 00:32:01,502
Thank you.

546
00:32:01,794 --> 00:32:05,340
Mr. McGill, I have only one
more question for you.

547
00:32:06,507 --> 00:32:08,426
Do you hate your brother?

548
00:32:10,011 --> 00:32:11,763
Absolutely not.

549
00:32:12,513 --> 00:32:14,432
I love my brother.

550
00:32:14,849 --> 00:32:17,477
There's nothing malicious in Jimmy.

551
00:32:18,561 --> 00:32:23,399
He has a way of doing the worst things
for reasons that sound almost noble.

552
00:32:25,234 --> 00:32:29,656
But what I know for sure is that
the law is too important to be toyed with.

553
00:32:29,822 --> 00:32:31,491
It's mankind's greatest achievement.

554
00:32:31,658 --> 00:32:33,952
The rule of law,
the idea that no matter who you are...

555
00:32:34,118 --> 00:32:36,996
...your actions have consequences.

556
00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:40,541
And the way my brother treats the law...

557
00:32:41,417 --> 00:32:43,127
...it breaks my heart.

558
00:32:43,419 --> 00:32:45,672
That's why I did what I did.
Not to hurt him...

559
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:48,675
...but to protect something
that I hold sacred.

560
00:32:48,758 --> 00:32:50,760
Thank you, Mr. McGill.

561
00:32:50,927 --> 00:32:52,136
The State Bar rests.

562
00:32:56,265 --> 00:32:59,435
[WHISPERING]
I think we need to put on the brakes.

563
00:33:02,146 --> 00:33:04,649
I'm sorry. My co-counsel and I
need a moment to confer.

564
00:33:06,275 --> 00:33:07,819
Please be brief, counselor.

565
00:33:08,027 --> 00:33:10,029
Yes, of course.

00:33:15,118 --> 00:33:17,120
Do you have anything for cross?

JIMMY [WHISPERING]:
Could I look at your notes?

569
00:33:19,372 --> 00:33:22,750
KIM: Yeah, of course. Can you--
JIMMY: Can you read the writing?

570
00:33:22,917 --> 00:33:24,460
KIM:
Yeah.

[WHISPERING INDISTINCTLY]

572
00:33:40,393 --> 00:33:43,354
Mr. Chairman. I'm sorry...

573
00:33:43,521 --> 00:33:46,274
...might I have a moment
to get a breath?

574
00:33:46,441 --> 00:33:48,568
Well, of course, Mr. McGill.

575
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:51,112
Folks, let's call this 15.

576
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:55,825
Everybody, please be back
and ready to go on the hour.

577
00:34:03,499 --> 00:34:05,501
-Rebecca.
-Chuck.

578
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:09,547
-It's good to see you.
-I have to say, I'm a bit surprised.

579
00:34:10,256 --> 00:34:13,051
Did Jimmy subpoena you?
You're not on the witness list.

580
00:34:13,217 --> 00:34:16,846
-You don't have to testify.
-No, no, no. I'm not here for that.

581
00:34:17,013 --> 00:34:18,931
Well, what then?

582
00:34:19,098 --> 00:34:20,391
Chuck, I wish you'd told me.

583
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:25,146
I-- I can't believe what
you've been going through.

584
00:34:25,313 --> 00:34:27,440
-How long has it been?
-Ah.

585
00:34:28,524 --> 00:34:30,151
You're here to help...

586
00:34:30,318 --> 00:34:33,196
...because all this is so stressful for me.

587
00:34:33,529 --> 00:34:36,407
-Is that what Jimmy told you?
-He's worried about you, Chuck.

588
00:34:36,574 --> 00:34:39,577
In spite of everything that's happened
between you two, he cares.

589
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:40,870
What exactly did he say?

590
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:43,372
Um.... Well, that you had been sick.

591
00:34:43,539 --> 00:34:45,083
Allergic to electricity?

592
00:34:45,291 --> 00:34:49,087
He sent me pictures of the house.
Chuck, my God.

593
00:34:50,296 --> 00:34:51,672
Why didn't you tell me?

594
00:34:52,173 --> 00:34:54,342
I didn't wanna upset you.

595
00:34:54,509 --> 00:34:56,928
Worry you unnecessarily.

596
00:34:57,970 --> 00:35:00,014
But now you're here.

597
00:35:00,181 --> 00:35:02,100
And now you know.

598
00:35:04,143 --> 00:35:06,312
I came because
I thought it was the right thing.

599
00:35:06,479 --> 00:35:09,398
I thought,
I don't know that you'd want me to.

600
00:35:09,565 --> 00:35:13,027
But I guess that
I'm more of a distraction.

601
00:35:13,194 --> 00:35:16,614
So I'm gonna be in town for a few days.

602
00:35:16,781 --> 00:35:19,700
And I would love to spend
some time with you.

603
00:35:19,867 --> 00:35:21,536
But right now, I think I should go.

604
00:35:21,702 --> 00:35:24,163
-No, no. Please. I want you to stay.
-Really?

605
00:35:24,330 --> 00:35:27,250
-You don't seem happy to see me.
-I am.

606
00:35:27,416 --> 00:35:30,169
I'm just surprised. That's all.

Please stay.

-Are you sure?
-Yes. I'm sure.

of goods, Rebecca.

I want you to see what's what.

Oh, yeah? What'd you expect?

00:35:58,823 --> 00:36:00,324
Not her. Heh.

615
00:36:04,078 --> 00:36:06,831
You know,
she's gonna hate you when this is over.

616
00:36:08,249 --> 00:36:09,750
Yep.

617
00:36:21,095 --> 00:36:24,599
All right. Mr. McGill, I'll remind you
you're still under oath.

618
00:36:24,765 --> 00:36:26,642
-I understand.
-At this time...

...I'd like to turn cross-examination
over to my co-counsel, James McGill.

[CLEARS THROAT]

621
00:36:38,196 --> 00:36:42,575
There's been a lot of fuss about it,
but we never really talked about this tape.

622
00:36:42,783 --> 00:36:47,121
We lost the opportunity when
you burglarized my house to destroy it.

623
00:36:47,288 --> 00:36:49,999
Fair enough.
And I was in the wrong there...

624
00:36:50,166 --> 00:36:55,546
...but still, I'd like to follow your story
of why and how you recorded it.

625
00:36:56,047 --> 00:36:58,424
Oh, is this where you claim
the tape is spurious?

626
00:36:58,633 --> 00:37:01,719
-That it's not really your voice?
-No. That's me on the tape.

627
00:37:02,845 --> 00:37:05,139
Still, I have some questions.
Like the recorder...

628
00:37:05,306 --> 00:37:08,309
...it must have hurt like hell
for you to touch that.

629
00:37:09,352 --> 00:37:11,437
There was a degree of discomfort.
That's true.

630
00:37:11,646 --> 00:37:12,939
And where did you hide it?

631
00:37:13,105 --> 00:37:16,275
The sound's pretty clear, so
it wasn't in the couch cushions, was it?

632
00:37:16,859 --> 00:37:19,070
Tucked under a space blanket.
Out of sight.

633
00:37:19,278 --> 00:37:20,279
Wow.

634
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:23,699
So no chance I'd see it,
not with the state your place was in.

635
00:37:23,866 --> 00:37:25,409
-Isn't that right?
-I suppose.

636
00:37:25,618 --> 00:37:28,496
Would you like to set the scene
for the disciplinary committee?

637
00:37:28,663 --> 00:37:31,624
Tell them what your house
looked like at the time of recording?

638
00:37:31,832 --> 00:37:34,085
Objection. Relevance?

639
00:37:34,293 --> 00:37:37,546
Well, the circumstances of the recording
are materially relevant.

640
00:37:37,713 --> 00:37:39,507
How can you know
what the tape means...

641
00:37:39,715 --> 00:37:41,801
...unless you know what was going on
when it was recorded?

642
00:37:42,009 --> 00:37:44,387
Overruled.
The witness can answer the question.

643
00:37:44,553 --> 00:37:48,724
I covered most of the walls with
Foil-Scrim Kraft insulation.

644
00:37:48,933 --> 00:37:51,602
I also hung a number
of space blankets.

Compact Mylar sheets.

646
00:37:54,689 --> 00:37:58,985
They insulate and protect against
mild electromagnetic radiation.

647
00:37:59,694 --> 00:38:01,612
All right, so shiny insulation...

648
00:38:01,779 --> 00:38:04,865
...and space blankets
all over the walls and ceiling.

649
00:38:05,032 --> 00:38:07,576
It was like being inside of a disco ball.

650
00:38:07,785 --> 00:38:09,412
Do you have a point?

651
00:38:10,204 --> 00:38:12,456
Well, I'm impressed...

652
00:38:12,665 --> 00:38:15,209
...by how much work
went into entrapping me.

653
00:38:15,376 --> 00:38:16,585
You went all out.

654
00:38:16,794 --> 00:38:17,920
I didn't entrap you.

655
00:38:18,087 --> 00:38:20,589
I provoked an admission
in adverse interest.

656
00:38:20,756 --> 00:38:22,341
That's not the same thing.

657
00:38:24,468 --> 00:38:26,595
How did you know it would work?

658
00:38:27,138 --> 00:38:28,306
What do you mean?

659
00:38:28,514 --> 00:38:31,225
How did you know
your provocation would work?

660
00:38:31,392 --> 00:38:35,604
Why'd you think a bunch of shiny plastic
would make me say anything?

661
00:38:36,772 --> 00:38:41,068
Isn't it because you knew that it was
precisely the thing that would worry me...

662
00:38:41,235 --> 00:38:43,821
...so much that I'd say anything
to talk you down?

663
00:38:43,988 --> 00:38:45,156
Objection.

664
00:38:45,364 --> 00:38:46,907
Okay. Withdrawn.

665
00:38:47,158 --> 00:38:49,910

00:38:50,077 --> 00:38:52,747
Every surface covered in tinfoil.

00:38:52,913 --> 00:38:56,167
-Nothing crazy about that, huh?
-As I've said...

668
00:38:56,334 --> 00:39:01,797
...I was playing up my condition.
Usually, it's a perfectly normal house.

669

You think your house is normal?
Can I call your attention to Exhibit 9?

670
00:39:10,806 --> 00:39:12,141
This is your house, right?

00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:13,934
Yes.

Exposed wires.

00:39:18,105 --> 00:39:19,648
There's a camp stove.

674
00:39:20,858 --> 00:39:23,986
There's a lantern
on top of newspapers.

675
00:39:24,153 --> 00:39:25,279
You call this normal?

676
00:39:25,488 --> 00:39:27,698
I call them adaptations.

677
00:39:27,865 --> 00:39:30,993
A prophylactic measure
for a physical medical condition.

678
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:33,245
Did the doctor who granted me
guardianship...

679
00:39:33,412 --> 00:39:35,247
...think this was a physical condition?

680
00:39:35,456 --> 00:39:38,334
Objection.
You can't introduce a TEG as evidence.

681
00:39:38,501 --> 00:39:42,922
Besides, the panel has already ruled
Mr. McGill's mental health is not at issue.

682
00:39:43,130 --> 00:39:45,549
No, the State Bar
opened the door to this on direct...

683
00:39:45,716 --> 00:39:48,386
...when the witness talked
about his supposed play-acting.

684
00:39:48,594 --> 00:39:51,806
Allowing me to follow up
on cross is only reasonable.

685
00:39:52,014 --> 00:39:54,350
We discussed a physical allergy.
Not a mental disability.

686
00:39:54,517 --> 00:39:57,478
Potato, "potato." It comes down to this:

687
00:39:57,645 --> 00:39:59,855
In order to understand
what I was thinking...

688
00:40:00,022 --> 00:40:01,941
...you need to see Chuck
through my eyes.

689
00:40:02,149 --> 00:40:06,320
You need to know
if I believe that tape was evidence.

690
00:40:06,529 --> 00:40:08,531
And I say it was evidence
of only one thing.

691
00:40:08,697 --> 00:40:10,866
My brother hates me.

692
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:15,329
Now, he claims that he lied to me
to get me to tell the truth.

693
00:40:15,496 --> 00:40:16,580
And I'm telling you...

694
00:40:16,789 --> 00:40:19,375
...I lied to my brother
to make him feel better.

695
00:40:19,542 --> 00:40:20,960
Which of us you believe...

696
00:40:21,127 --> 00:40:25,548
...depends on how we all understand
the mind of Charles McGill.

697
00:40:27,174 --> 00:40:30,052
We did promise
the defense some leeway.

698
00:40:31,554 --> 00:40:33,556
-You may proceed.
JIMMY: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

699
00:40:33,722 --> 00:40:35,599
But watch yourself.

700
00:40:42,606 --> 00:40:45,109
Chuck, I'd like to go back a little further.

701
00:40:45,276 --> 00:40:47,820
Talk about when
these symptoms first started. It was...

702
00:40:47,987 --> 00:40:51,490
...shortly after you were divorced,
is that right?

703
00:40:52,825 --> 00:40:55,911
-Yes.
-You think the stress of the divorce...

704
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:57,913
-...brought on the illness?
-I doubt it.

705
00:40:58,122 --> 00:41:01,542
It was an amicable split.
My ex-wife and I are still on good terms.

706
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:04,795
In fact, your ex-wife is present
with us today. Is she not?

707
00:41:05,463 --> 00:41:07,798
-When was the last time you saw each--?
-Objection.

708
00:41:07,965 --> 00:41:09,133
This is not family court.

709
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:11,677
We're not here
to re-litigate the witness's divorce.

710
00:41:11,844 --> 00:41:14,930
-I can't see what purpose this serves.
CHUCK: I can.

711
00:41:15,097 --> 00:41:18,434
I'll tell you why my brother
brought my ex-wife to this hearing.

712
00:41:18,601 --> 00:41:20,978
Four thousand miles, she came.

713
00:41:21,145 --> 00:41:23,731
Lured by concern for me.

714
00:41:24,148 --> 00:41:28,694
What Jimmy's driving at is the last time
I saw her, I covered up my illness.

715
00:41:28,903 --> 00:41:31,071
I'd been suffering
from it for some time.

716
00:41:31,238 --> 00:41:35,117
But I went to great lengths
to conceal that fact from her.

717
00:41:36,535 --> 00:41:39,205
I'm sorry I deceived you, Rebecca.

718
00:41:41,248 --> 00:41:43,167
I didn't want you to think less of me.

719
00:41:46,212 --> 00:41:48,172
Now Jimmy's outed me in front of you.

720
00:41:48,964 --> 00:41:50,508
You know why?

721
00:41:50,925 --> 00:41:52,092
To rattle me.

722
00:41:52,301 --> 00:41:54,762
He knows I still have...

723
00:41:55,054 --> 00:41:58,682
...a lot of feeling for my ex-wife.

724
00:41:58,849 --> 00:42:01,143
He's hoping this will break me down.

725
00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:04,063
Split me apart at the seams
like a murderer confessing...

726
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:06,315
...on an episode of <i>Perry Mason.</i>

727
00:42:07,608 --> 00:42:11,070
Well, I'm sorry
to disappoint you, Jimmy.

728
00:42:12,821 --> 00:42:16,909
Have I answered your questions
to your satisfaction?

729
00:42:17,243 --> 00:42:19,245
Do you have anything else?

730
00:42:21,247 --> 00:42:22,998
Yeah, I do.

731
00:42:23,165 --> 00:42:25,251
Earlier,
you talked about other diseases...

732
00:42:25,459 --> 00:42:29,296
...physical conditions,
you said, so, okay...

733
00:42:29,505 --> 00:42:32,132
...if you'd had,
I don't know, lung cancer...

734
00:42:32,299 --> 00:42:34,510
...would you have told Rebecca then?

735
00:42:36,512 --> 00:42:39,223
If that had been the case, maybe.
I might have.

736
00:42:39,431 --> 00:42:41,225
-So how is this different?
COMMITTEE MEMBER: Mr. McGill.

737
00:42:41,433 --> 00:42:44,019
-Move it along.
-You don't have to answer that.

738
00:42:44,186 --> 00:42:47,898
I wanna get down to brass tacks.
I wanna be very, very specific here.

739
00:42:48,065 --> 00:42:50,609
This illness, what does it feel like?

740
00:42:50,776 --> 00:42:52,236
You mentioned it's painful.

741
00:42:52,444 --> 00:42:54,029
It is.

742
00:42:54,196 --> 00:42:55,823
There's a tightness in my chest...

743
00:42:55,990 --> 00:42:57,658
...difficulty breathing...

744
00:42:57,825 --> 00:42:59,285
...and pain.

745
00:42:59,451 --> 00:43:02,454
Burning pain.
The pain spreads everywhere.

746
00:43:02,705 --> 00:43:04,915
Sounds horrible.
Does it hurt right now?

747
00:43:05,124 --> 00:43:07,668
CHUCK:
There's always some discomfort, yes.

748
00:43:08,210 --> 00:43:11,297
Electricity is everywhere
in the modern world.

749
00:43:11,797 --> 00:43:14,800
But I very much appreciate
the indulgence of the panel...

750
00:43:14,967 --> 00:43:16,677
...for their accommodation today.

751
00:43:16,885 --> 00:43:19,555
I can handle this fine.

752
00:43:22,850 --> 00:43:25,561
Right.
So with the lights out, you don't feel them.

753
00:43:25,728 --> 00:43:27,605
CHUCK: If the current's not flowing, no.

754
00:43:27,771 --> 00:43:31,400
Sorry about the exit signs.
I guess they couldn't kill those for you.

755
00:43:31,567 --> 00:43:34,653
CHUCK: They're not drawing much current,
and they're far away.

756
00:43:34,903 --> 00:43:38,741
Intensity drops off with distance
per the inverse-square law.

757
00:43:38,907 --> 00:43:41,368
Oh, yeah, whoa.
Inverse-square. I'm not a physicist.

758
00:43:41,535 --> 00:43:43,746
Could you dumb that down
a shade for me?

759
00:43:43,912 --> 00:43:45,080
The farther away it is...

760
00:43:45,247 --> 00:43:48,250
...the stronger the source
needs to be to have an effect.

761
00:43:48,417 --> 00:43:51,086
JIMMY: Got it. Got it.
So if I had a small battery, say...

762
00:43:51,295 --> 00:43:53,797
...from a watch,
and I got up close to your skin...

763
00:43:53,964 --> 00:43:55,049
...you'd know?

764
00:43:55,215 --> 00:43:56,467
I would feel it, yes.

765
00:43:56,634 --> 00:44:00,346
Can you feel more current coming
from any particular direction right now?

766
00:44:00,512 --> 00:44:03,390
From that back wall or....?

767
00:44:03,557 --> 00:44:06,226
From over there
or up through the floor?

768
00:44:06,393 --> 00:44:10,397
Can you tell us
where the nearest source is right now?

769
00:44:13,901 --> 00:44:16,070
Jimmy, do you have
something in your pocket?

770
00:44:18,656 --> 00:44:22,117
Yes, I do, as a matter of fact.

771
00:44:25,037 --> 00:44:26,330
My cell phone.

772
00:44:26,497 --> 00:44:30,125
From this distance, you should feel it,
and you don't, do you?

773
00:44:30,292 --> 00:44:33,253
Mr. McGill, you were warned
to leave your electronics outside.

774
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:35,839
It's all right.

775
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:37,675
It's all right.

776
00:44:38,467 --> 00:44:39,802
May I?

777
00:44:45,391 --> 00:44:47,142
Just as I thought.

778
00:44:47,309 --> 00:44:48,727
There's no battery in here.

779
00:44:48,936 --> 00:44:51,271
You removed the battery.

780
00:44:52,856 --> 00:44:55,734
That's a sorry little trick, isn't it?

781
00:44:55,901 --> 00:44:58,153
Yeah, you got me, Chuck.
Dead to rights.

782
00:44:58,862 --> 00:45:00,072
I removed the battery.

783
00:45:01,115 --> 00:45:02,866
-Objection.
CHAIRMAN: Sustained.

784
00:45:03,033 --> 00:45:06,120
You've taken all the leeway
you're getting, Mr. McGill. Wrap it up.

785
00:45:07,246 --> 00:45:09,206
God, Jimmy.

786
00:45:09,873 --> 00:45:11,542
Don't you know by now this is real?

787
00:45:11,708 --> 00:45:12,918
I feel this.

788
00:45:13,085 --> 00:45:17,798
It's a physical response to stimuli.
It's not a quirk.

I don't know, Chuck.

00:45:24,721 --> 00:45:27,891

00:45:29,893 --> 00:45:31,478

00:45:37,943 --> 00:45:40,279
JIMMY:
Can you tell the court what that was?

795
00:45:42,614 --> 00:45:43,949
-A battery.
ALLEY: Mr. Chairman.

796
00:45:44,158 --> 00:45:45,742
-Please.
-You recognize that man?

797
00:45:45,951 --> 00:45:48,454
His name is Huell Babineaux.
He's on our witness list.

798
00:45:48,662 --> 00:45:50,456
You bumped into him in the stairway.

00:45:50,664 --> 00:45:53,500
He'll testify he planted this
fully-charged battery on you...

800

...over an hour and a half ago.

801

-An hour and 43 minutes ago.
-An hour and 43 minutes.

And you felt nothing.

804

CHUCK: No. It's a trick. It has to be.
-Enough is enough.

805
00:46:04,762 --> 00:46:07,973
I submit that Mr. McGill's mental illness
is a non-issue.

806
00:46:08,182 --> 00:46:10,559

it wouldn't take away--

I am not crazy.

I knew it was "1216."

One after Magna Carta.

812
00:46:24,531 --> 00:46:26,909
As if I could ever make such a mistake.
Never.

813
00:46:27,075 --> 00:46:30,704
Never. I just couldn't prove it.

00:46:32,289 --> 00:46:34,583
He got that idiot at the copy shop
to lie for him.

-You think this is something?

You think this is bad? This chicanery?

No. He orchestrated it.

Jimmy.

823
00:46:51,225 --> 00:46:54,520
He defecated through a sunroof.

824
00:46:54,728 --> 00:46:56,188
And I saved him.

825
00:46:56,355 --> 00:46:59,650
I shouldn't have.
I took him into my own firm.

00:47:03,987 --> 00:47:07,741
He'll never change.
Ever since he was 9, always the same.
