-So?!

526
00:49:04,691 --> 00:49:06,485
You took advantage of Mrs. Landry.

ERIN [OVER PA]: <i>Does she know</i>
<i>how much money you're gonna make?</i>

528
00:49:09,071 --> 00:49:12,240
JIMMY [OVER PA]:
<i>Nope. And again, I ask, so what?</i>

529
00:49:12,407 --> 00:49:14,117
ERIN:
<i>These people trusted you, Jimmy.</i>

530
00:49:14,284 --> 00:49:17,496
JIMMY: <i>Do you have any idea</i>
<i>how much time I had to put in...</i>

531
00:49:17,663 --> 00:49:20,499
<i>...listening to their ramblings</i>
<i>about their sciatica...</i>

532
00:49:20,666 --> 00:49:23,043
<i>...or which grandchild</i>
<i>disappoints them?</i>

533
00:49:23,210 --> 00:49:24,670
Damn right they trust me.

534
00:49:24,836 --> 00:49:28,674
-I worked my ass off earning their trust.
-Then you betrayed it.

535
00:49:28,840 --> 00:49:32,928
If the only thing standing between me and
a million bucks is some old lady's tears...

536
00:49:33,095 --> 00:49:35,055
...I'd suggest investing in Kleenex.

537
00:49:35,222 --> 00:49:36,890
You ruined her life
because you wanted your money.

538
00:49:37,057 --> 00:49:38,975
Boo and hoo.

539
00:49:39,142 --> 00:49:43,021
Besides, it's not like she's got
that much time left, anyway.

540
00:49:43,188 --> 00:49:44,439
You're disgusting.

541
00:49:44,940 --> 00:49:47,192
And rich.

543
00:49:51,238 --> 00:49:52,614
Hey, everyone. Apologies.

544
00:49:52,781 --> 00:49:56,827
That was probably more like 20 breaths
instead of 10--

545
00:49:57,703 --> 00:50:00,288
I don't see a lot of
forward folding going on.

546
00:50:14,803 --> 00:50:16,888
Come on, girls.

547
00:50:18,849 --> 00:50:20,809
Shame on you.

ERIN:
So?

549
00:50:43,373 --> 00:50:46,293
-Like a charm. Yeah.
-She'll go back on the settlement?

550
00:50:46,460 --> 00:50:49,838
I imagine you'll hear from her
within an hour or so.

551
00:50:50,338 --> 00:50:52,466
-Good.
-Hey.

552
00:50:52,632 --> 00:50:54,134
Well done in there.

553
00:50:54,301 --> 00:50:56,303
I meant every word I said.

554
00:50:58,013 --> 00:50:59,514
I know.

00:51:01,308 --> 00:51:02,976

-Okay, I'll meet you guys there in an hour.
-Sounds good.

559
00:51:31,338 --> 00:51:33,215
Hey. You guys about done?

560
00:51:33,381 --> 00:51:34,841
Yep.

561
00:51:35,258 --> 00:51:37,302
Listen, I, um....

562
00:51:37,469 --> 00:51:39,679
I'm real sorry that this didn't work out.

563
00:51:39,846 --> 00:51:40,972
It's fine.

564
00:51:41,139 --> 00:51:45,852
I already talked to my old supervisor.
Looks like they can take me back, so....

565
00:51:46,019 --> 00:51:47,395
Oh, that's great.

566
00:51:47,562 --> 00:51:50,899
And, you know,
if we ever get another office up...

567
00:51:51,066 --> 00:51:52,692
...you'd be our first call.

568
00:51:54,486 --> 00:51:57,280
Yeah, okay.

569
00:51:57,489 --> 00:51:58,824
Good to know.

-Bye, Kim.
-Oh, bye.

00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:18,718
She understands.

572
00:52:22,430 --> 00:52:24,432
So, uh, what's left?

573
00:52:24,933 --> 00:52:27,727
Think this is it.
This is all admin stuff. Uh....

Appointment book. Your Rolodex.

00:52:34,150 --> 00:52:36,278
Hey, why'd you do that?

576
00:52:36,444 --> 00:52:39,906
Because no senior's coming
within 20 feet of me ever again.

577
00:52:40,073 --> 00:52:42,325
I'm gonna need
a whole new business model...

578
00:52:42,492 --> 00:52:44,077
...when I get my license back.

579
00:52:44,244 --> 00:52:45,996
Kim, it's pointless.

580
00:52:46,204 --> 00:52:49,207
They're smearing my name
across the tristate area...

581
00:52:49,374 --> 00:52:52,210
...sending telegrams
to everyone far and near.

582
00:52:52,919 --> 00:52:54,588
You never know.

583
00:53:03,513 --> 00:53:05,348
It's a good wall.

-You think?
-Yeah.

585
