504
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:57,829
Tell us about Kim Wexler.

505
00:34:58,629 --> 00:35:01,299
-You started in the mailroom, right?
KIM: I did.

506
00:35:01,466 --> 00:35:04,535
I was there almost, well,
ten years ago now.

507
00:35:04,669 --> 00:35:07,238
Pulled yourself up by your boot straps.
I like that.

508
00:35:07,371 --> 00:35:09,674
I see you went to UNM Law.
Are you from New Mexico?

509
00:35:09,841 --> 00:35:11,309
Not originally.

510
00:35:12,343 --> 00:35:15,413
I'm from the Midwest. Just a tiny little
town barely on the map.

511
00:35:15,546 --> 00:35:17,248
Near the Kansas/Nebraska border.

512
00:35:17,815 --> 00:35:19,517
You've never heard of it.

513
00:35:20,251 --> 00:35:21,652
So, what brought you here?

514
00:35:22,553 --> 00:35:24,255
I guess...

515
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:28,826
...one day I just looked around
at my life, at who I was...

516
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:31,295
...and realized if I kept going
the way I was--

517
00:35:31,462 --> 00:35:32,897
Which way was that?

518
00:35:33,831 --> 00:35:37,635
Best case, probably married to the guy
that ran the town gas station.

519
00:35:37,768 --> 00:35:40,304
Maybe cashiering
down at the Hinky Dinky.

520
00:35:40,471 --> 00:35:42,406
-The Hinky what?
KIM: Hinky Dinky.

521
00:35:43,241 --> 00:35:45,710
It was our supermarket. Um....

522
00:35:45,843 --> 00:35:47,578
I just wanted something else.

523
00:35:48,279 --> 00:35:49,714
What did you want?

524
00:35:53,284 --> 00:35:54,552
More.

525
00:35:55,753 --> 00:35:57,922
SCHWEIKART: Well, thanks
for coming by. Always a pleasure.

526
00:35:58,256 --> 00:36:00,191
LYNNE: Great to put a face to the name.
KIM: Thanks.

527
00:36:00,324 --> 00:36:02,627
SCHWEIKART: We're gonna put
our heads together and discuss...

528
00:36:02,793 --> 00:36:06,164
...but I feel safe to say you can expect
to hear from us by tomorrow.

529
00:36:06,597 --> 00:36:08,166
That's...

530
00:36:08,599 --> 00:36:10,535
...fantastic. I look forward to it.

531
00:36:10,668 --> 00:36:13,504
We liked you when you came in here.
We like you more now.

532
00:36:13,638 --> 00:36:18,776
Well, thank you so much for taking
the time, and I will speak to you soon.

533
00:36:18,910 --> 00:36:20,611
-Great to meet you, Lynne.
-You too.

534
00:36:20,745 --> 00:36:21,779
-Perry.
-Pleasure, Kim.

535
00:36:22,246 --> 00:36:24,415
-Howard.
-It's Rich, actually.

536
00:36:24,615 --> 00:36:26,551
-Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.
SCHWEIKART: No, no.

537
00:36:26,684 --> 00:36:29,453
I'm happy to be confused with Howard.
He's a good-looking man.

538
00:36:29,654 --> 00:36:31,255
Don't worry about it.

539
00:36:32,523 --> 00:36:33,958
Come on, I'll walk you out.

-He's in a meeting.
-A meeting?

545
00:38:27,905 --> 00:38:29,473
Have a seat.

It's your funeral, dude.

-Hey, what are you doing here?
-Just in the neighborhood.

-Great. Oh, and I want a dolly this time.

-Hey, watch your mouth around the lady.

How should I know?
You're the nerd. Just make it cheap.

Wow, you finally got

00:39:14,785 --> 00:39:17,088
Finally got my cocobolo desk.

Feel like it's a good omen
for what's next.

And what's that?

561
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:26,864
This. Solo practice.
Being my own man again.

562
00:39:30,935 --> 00:39:32,937
So how'd it go with Schweikart?

563
00:39:33,437 --> 00:39:34,905
It went well.

You were right. It's time for me
to be my own boss.

it's a good idea now?

-Don't tell me you've changed your mind.
-No, I--

Good. To that end...

00:40:21,852 --> 00:40:24,488
...I have a pitch for you.

579
00:40:31,061 --> 00:40:33,831
Not Wexler-McGill, but...

580
00:40:33,964 --> 00:40:37,668
...Wexler and McGill.

581
00:40:38,502 --> 00:40:43,741
We find an office, share the housekeeping
costs, rent, electricity, everything.

582
00:40:43,941 --> 00:40:48,612
But I am Kim Wexler, attorney at law,
and you are Jimmy McGill, attorney at law.

Why can't we share a taxi?

You do things your way,
and I do them mine.

00:41:01,192 --> 00:41:05,830
We'll have freedom, but we aren't each
trying to go it alone.

00:41:06,831 --> 00:41:10,868
Not partners.
Solo practitioners together.
