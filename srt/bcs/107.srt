00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:43,197
Cocobolo desk.

391
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:43,197
A what?

392
00:13:43,197 --> 00:13:44,532
I don't know what it means,

393
00:13:44,532 --> 00:13:47,160
but I just like

394
00:13:44,532 --> 00:13:47,160
saying the word. Cocobolo.

395
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:50,997
Okay, well, whatever it is,

396
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:50,997
you deserve it.

397
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:56,127
And I want you

398
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:56,127
to see this one.

399
00:14:01,591 --> 00:14:03,551
Here we are.

400
00:14:04,761 --> 00:14:06,179
Ha, ha. Whoa.

401
00:14:07,472 --> 00:14:10,517
This is way better

402
00:14:07,472 --> 00:14:10,517
than the other one.

403
00:14:10,517 --> 00:14:13,394
You think?

404
00:14:10,517 --> 00:14:13,394
Uh, yeah. Who goes in here?

405
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:17,398
Because I'd be all up

406
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:17,398
in here if I were you.

407
00:14:17,398 --> 00:14:21,068
JIMMY:

408
00:14:17,398 --> 00:14:21,068
Yeah. Yeah, you know,

409
00:14:17,398 --> 00:14:21,068
you're right.

410
00:14:21,068 --> 00:14:23,530
It is real nice.

411
00:14:21,068 --> 00:14:23,530
It's a corner office.

412
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:25,239
You gotta go with

413
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:25,239
the corner office.

414
00:14:25,239 --> 00:14:26,574
Saving it for someone.

415
00:14:26,574 --> 00:14:28,535
Who?

416
00:14:26,574 --> 00:14:28,535
Well, my partner.

417
00:14:28,535 --> 00:14:30,787
Your partner? Who's...?

418
00:14:32,706 --> 00:14:35,542
Who would that be?

419
00:14:35,542 --> 00:14:39,212
Well, you said you were

420
00:14:35,542 --> 00:14:39,212
interested in elder law.

421
00:14:39,212 --> 00:14:42,716
That's-- That is so...

422
00:14:42,716 --> 00:14:45,802
Thank you. Really.

423
00:14:45,802 --> 00:14:48,971
But you know I've got

424
00:14:45,802 --> 00:14:48,971
a lot invested at HHM.

425
00:14:48,971 --> 00:14:51,932
With what's going on now,

426
00:14:48,971 --> 00:14:51,932
I'm closer than ever to partner.

427
00:14:51,932 --> 00:14:54,394
Like maybe two years,

428
00:14:51,932 --> 00:14:54,394
and I'm in.

429
00:14:54,394 --> 00:14:56,437
Yeah, I know.

430
00:14:56,437 --> 00:14:59,774
Yeah, it's...

431
00:14:56,437 --> 00:14:59,774
It's just a thought.

432
00:14:59,774 --> 00:15:03,027
Plus, you know, they put me

433
00:14:59,774 --> 00:15:03,027
through law school.

434
00:15:03,027 --> 00:15:04,487
I feel like I owe them.

435
00:15:04,487 --> 00:15:07,782
Actually, I do owe them,

436
00:15:04,487 --> 00:15:07,782
literally, you know?

437
00:15:07,782 --> 00:15:11,202
But it's a nice thought,

438
00:15:07,782 --> 00:15:11,202
Jimmy.

439
00:15:11,202 --> 00:15:14,080
Just, uh, you know,

440
00:15:11,202 --> 00:15:14,080
playing with ideas.

441
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,998
I had the extra office

442
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,998
and everything.

443
00:15:15,998 --> 00:15:17,834
Yeah, no, I get it.

444
00:15:22,171 --> 00:15:26,217
I want to see

445
00:15:22,171 --> 00:15:26,217
the kitchen.

446
00:15:30,847 --> 00:15:32,849
Wow.

447
00:15:32,849 --> 00:15:35,476
They have stainless

448
00:15:32,849 --> 00:15:35,476
in here.

449
00:15:35,476 --> 00:15:37,645
I don't even have

450
00:15:35,476 --> 00:15:37,645
stainless at home.

451
00:15:43,777 --> 00:15:46,362
KIM:

452
00:15:43,777 --> 00:15:46,362
I know this is the last thing

453
00:15:43,777 --> 00:15:46,362
you wanna hear.

454
00:15:46,362 --> 00:15:49,282
I think your chances

455
00:15:46,362 --> 00:15:49,282
of getting a favorable ruling

456
00:15:49,282 --> 00:15:51,910
from a jury

457
00:15:49,282 --> 00:15:51,910
are very slim.

458
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:55,329
CRAIG:

459
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:55,329
What does that mean?

460
00:15:55,329 --> 00:15:57,624
We're not in a great position

461
00:15:55,329 --> 00:15:57,624
to win at trial.

462
00:15:57,624 --> 00:15:59,626
But we came to you people

463
00:15:57,624 --> 00:15:59,626
because we were told

464
00:15:59,626 --> 00:16:01,377
you win cases.

465
00:16:01,377 --> 00:16:03,880
Winning doesn't always mean

466
00:16:01,377 --> 00:16:03,880
getting a favorable verdict.

467
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:06,800
We try to achieve

468
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:06,800
the best outcome for our clients

469
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,594
given each

470
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,594
individual case.

471
00:16:09,594 --> 00:16:12,764
Frankly, we've worked very hard

472
00:16:09,594 --> 00:16:12,764
to stave off an arrest,

473
00:16:12,764 --> 00:16:16,726
after the misunderstanding

474
00:16:12,764 --> 00:16:16,726
about your, uh, camping trip.

475
00:16:16,726 --> 00:16:19,019
The DA was concerned

476
00:16:16,726 --> 00:16:19,019
you might be a flight risk.

477
00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:20,980
Heh. Flight risk?

478
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:23,775
We were practically

479
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:23,775
in our own backyard. Heh.

480
00:16:23,775 --> 00:16:25,777
That's exactly

481
00:16:23,775 --> 00:16:25,777
what we told the DA.

482
00:16:25,777 --> 00:16:27,821
We've managed

483
00:16:25,777 --> 00:16:27,821
to come up with a deal

484
00:16:27,821 --> 00:16:29,906
that is favorable

485
00:16:27,821 --> 00:16:29,906
under the circumstances.

486
00:16:29,906 --> 00:16:32,867
Deal. I hate that terminology.

487
00:16:29,906 --> 00:16:32,867
A deal is what they got O.J.

488
00:16:32,867 --> 00:16:35,536
Maybe we should hear it.

489
00:16:32,867 --> 00:16:35,536
It's a terrible term.

490
00:16:35,536 --> 00:16:37,914
What kind of deal?

491
00:16:37,914 --> 00:16:40,500
If the prosecution

492
00:16:37,914 --> 00:16:40,500
decides to file,

493
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,585
which is the direction

494
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,585
this seems to be headed,

495
00:16:42,585 --> 00:16:45,129
and if they choose

496
00:16:42,585 --> 00:16:45,129
to stack charges, Craig,

497
00:16:45,129 --> 00:16:47,298
you're looking at 30 years

498
00:16:45,129 --> 00:16:47,298
in prison.

499
00:16:47,298 --> 00:16:49,592
Thirty years?

500
00:16:47,298 --> 00:16:49,592
KIM: That's the maximum.

501
00:16:49,592 --> 00:16:52,512
Given the nature of the charge

502
00:16:49,592 --> 00:16:52,512
and political environment,

503
00:16:52,512 --> 00:16:54,305
I'd say we should expect it.

504
00:16:54,305 --> 00:16:59,268
The public outcry in cases like

505
00:16:54,305 --> 00:16:59,268
these is a big factor. However,

506
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:01,270
after much discussion

507
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:01,270
with the DA,

508
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:04,607
who is also invested in keeping

509
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:04,607
the press to a minimum,

510
00:17:04,607 --> 00:17:06,359
we have arrived

511
00:17:04,607 --> 00:17:06,359
at an arrangement

512
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:08,235
which would

513
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:08,235
include 16 months

514
00:17:08,235 --> 00:17:11,322
in a county facility.

515
00:17:08,235 --> 00:17:11,322
Sixteen months?

516
00:17:11,322 --> 00:17:13,282
Down from 30 years.

517
00:17:13,282 --> 00:17:15,242
And you most likely

518
00:17:13,282 --> 00:17:15,242
wouldn't serve all of it.

519
00:17:15,242 --> 00:17:17,871
But he would have to say

520
00:17:15,242 --> 00:17:17,871
he was guilty.

521
00:17:17,871 --> 00:17:20,915
Admitting wrongdoing and

522
00:17:17,871 --> 00:17:20,915
making the county whole again

523
00:17:20,915 --> 00:17:23,209
goes a long way,

524
00:17:20,915 --> 00:17:23,209
hence the minimal sentence.

525
00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:25,169
Making the county whole again?

526
00:17:25,169 --> 00:17:27,630
It includes the stipulation

527
00:17:25,169 --> 00:17:27,630
that you return

528
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:30,299
$1.6 million

529
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:30,299
in misappropriated funds.

530
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:32,218
Give back the money?

531
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:32,218
There is no money.

532
00:17:32,218 --> 00:17:34,804
We told you

533
00:17:32,218 --> 00:17:34,804
Craig is innocent.

534
00:17:34,804 --> 00:17:38,850
I understand. However,

535
00:17:34,804 --> 00:17:38,850
I'd like to emphasize again

536
00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:42,436
that this deal is Craig's best

537
00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:42,436
chance of minimizing jail time.

538
00:17:42,436 --> 00:17:45,648
You're telling us

539
00:17:42,436 --> 00:17:45,648
there are drug dealers

540
00:17:45,648 --> 00:17:47,483
and murderers

541
00:17:45,648 --> 00:17:47,483
walking the streets,

542
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:50,528
but instead of them, they wanna

543
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:50,528
put an innocent man in jail?

544
00:17:50,528 --> 00:17:53,573
There's no other way?

545
00:17:50,528 --> 00:17:53,573
I'm sorry.

546
00:17:53,573 --> 00:17:56,242
I think under the circumstances,

547
00:17:53,573 --> 00:17:56,242
this is your best option.

548
00:17:56,242 --> 00:18:00,496
Murderers and rapists,

549
00:17:56,242 --> 00:18:00,496
and this is how they--?

550
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:03,499
Okay. There is no money.

551
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:03,499
There never was.

552
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:05,585
You have to take this to trial.

553
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:05,585
KIM: Look,

554
00:18:05,585 --> 00:18:07,754
you have a difficult,

555
00:18:07,754 --> 00:18:11,716
but nevertheless straightforward

556
00:18:07,754 --> 00:18:11,716
choice to make here.

557
00:18:11,716 --> 00:18:13,426
On one hand,

558
00:18:11,716 --> 00:18:13,426
you give up the money--

559
00:18:13,426 --> 00:18:16,178
Ah-- I just told you,

560
00:18:13,426 --> 00:18:16,178
there is no money.

561
00:18:16,178 --> 00:18:19,181
Plead guilty.

562
00:18:16,178 --> 00:18:19,181
It's painful, I know.

563
00:18:19,181 --> 00:18:23,436
And go to jail for a year and

564
00:18:19,181 --> 00:18:23,436
a half. But your other choice,

565
00:18:23,436 --> 00:18:26,146
that is no choice at all.

566
00:18:26,146 --> 00:18:28,649
If you go to trial,

567
00:18:26,146 --> 00:18:28,649
you'll most likely lose,

568
00:18:28,649 --> 00:18:30,818
and Craig goes to prison

569
00:18:28,649 --> 00:18:30,818
for decades.

570
00:18:30,818 --> 00:18:33,279
Your children will

571
00:18:30,818 --> 00:18:33,279
grow up seeing their dad

572
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:36,032
through bars

573
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:36,032
on visiting day.

574
00:18:37,825 --> 00:18:40,202
I know what I'd do.

575
00:18:40,202 --> 00:18:43,081
I'd take the deal.

576
00:18:43,081 --> 00:18:45,083
Two years from now,

577
00:18:43,081 --> 00:18:45,083
you can be starting over.

578
00:18:45,083 --> 00:18:48,795
It's tough, I know.

579
00:18:48,795 --> 00:18:50,630
But you're tough people.

580
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:54,467
And your family

581
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:54,467
is worth it.

582
00:18:58,304 --> 00:19:00,556

00:24:06,444 --> 00:24:08,239
to piss them off,

776
00:24:08,239 --> 00:24:09,823
but it must have been good.

777
00:24:09,823 --> 00:24:11,867
<i>What did they tell you?</i> 

778
00:24:09,823 --> 00:24:11,867
Not much.

779
00:24:11,867 --> 00:24:15,495
Just that you treated them

780
00:24:11,867 --> 00:24:15,495
like they were guilty.

781
00:24:15,495 --> 00:24:17,998
Heh. Jesus.

782
00:24:17,998 --> 00:24:20,251
Look, Jimmy,

783
00:24:20,251 --> 00:24:22,086
I know--

784
00:24:22,086 --> 00:24:23,629
I know this is a lot to ask,

785
00:24:23,629 --> 00:24:26,048
but you have to convince them

786
00:24:23,629 --> 00:24:26,048
to come back to HHM.

787
00:24:26,048 --> 00:24:28,342
I do, huh?

788
00:24:26,048 --> 00:24:28,342
<i>Yes.</i>

789
00:24:28,342 --> 00:24:30,094
<i>Please. It's important.</i>

790
00:24:30,094 --> 00:24:32,430
What's it worth to you?

791
00:24:30,094 --> 00:24:32,430
<i>Jimmy, I'm serious.</i>

792
00:24:32,430 --> 00:24:34,932
<i>They left because they think</i>

793
00:24:32,430 --> 00:24:34,932
<i>they can win this case,</i>

794
00:24:34,932 --> 00:24:37,559
but they can't.

795
00:24:34,932 --> 00:24:37,559
I managed to scrape together,

796
00:24:37,559 --> 00:24:39,603
from practically nothing,

797
00:24:37,559 --> 00:24:39,603
I might add,

798
00:24:39,603 --> 00:24:41,230
a deal they should

799
00:24:39,603 --> 00:24:41,230
feel lucky to have.

800
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:43,941
This is their

801
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:43,941
absolute best bet.

802
00:24:44,942 --> 00:24:47,569
Please?

803
00:24:44,942 --> 00:24:47,569
Make them understand

804
00:24:47,569 --> 00:24:50,864
<i>it's better for them</i>

805
00:24:47,569 --> 00:24:50,864
<i>if they come back.</i>

806
00:24:50,864 --> 00:24:53,367
Tell me about this deal.

807
00:24:53,367 --> 00:24:54,994
Elder law?

808
00:24:54,994 --> 00:24:57,663
I don't know what that is.

809
00:24:54,994 --> 00:24:57,663
Yeah. Me neither.

810
00:24:58,831 --> 00:25:00,458
Elder.

811
00:25:00,458 --> 00:25:02,626
What do you do with--

812
00:25:00,458 --> 00:25:02,626
Maybe if we were older--

813
00:25:02,626 --> 00:25:04,711
Sorry. Whoo.

814
00:25:02,626 --> 00:25:04,711
Oh.

815
00:25:04,711 --> 00:25:07,256
Ha-ha-ha. Right?

816
00:25:04,711 --> 00:25:07,256
The mysteries of the bladder.

817
00:25:07,256 --> 00:25:09,633
Ha-ha-ha.

818
00:25:07,256 --> 00:25:09,633
So how do we get started?

819
00:25:09,633 --> 00:25:12,428
Do you need us to sign

820
00:25:09,633 --> 00:25:12,428
that little paper?

821
00:25:12,428 --> 00:25:16,432
I am-- I am very sorry, but I'm

822
00:25:12,428 --> 00:25:16,432
afraid I can't take your case.

823
00:25:16,432 --> 00:25:20,478
My schedule is just--

824
00:25:16,432 --> 00:25:20,478
It's just chock-full right now.

825
00:25:20,478 --> 00:25:23,272
I highly encourage you

826
00:25:20,478 --> 00:25:23,272
to go back to HHM.

827
00:25:23,272 --> 00:25:25,607
I'm certain they would

828
00:25:23,272 --> 00:25:25,607
welcome you with open arms.

829
00:25:25,607 --> 00:25:27,567
No, we're not

830
00:25:25,607 --> 00:25:27,567
going back there.

831
00:25:27,567 --> 00:25:30,612
They were incompatible.

832
00:25:30,612 --> 00:25:33,407
I understand. They asked you

833
00:25:30,612 --> 00:25:33,407
to face some harsh realities.

834
00:25:33,407 --> 00:25:35,826
And I get it.

835
00:25:33,407 --> 00:25:35,826
No one likes that.

836
00:25:35,826 --> 00:25:40,039
But bottom line here,

837
00:25:35,826 --> 00:25:40,039
Kim Wexler is a fine attorney.

838
00:25:40,039 --> 00:25:42,416
She has a great relationship

839
00:25:40,039 --> 00:25:42,416
with the DA.

840
00:25:42,416 --> 00:25:45,044
Much as I'd love

841
00:25:42,416 --> 00:25:45,044
to sing my own praises,

842
00:25:45,044 --> 00:25:46,920
I doubt I could

843
00:25:45,044 --> 00:25:46,920
get you a deal

844
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,755
as good as the one

845
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,755
she already has.

846
00:25:48,755 --> 00:25:52,218
Okay.

847
00:25:48,755 --> 00:25:52,218
We don't want a deal.

848
00:25:52,218 --> 00:25:55,429
We want you, our lawyer,

849
00:25:52,218 --> 00:25:55,429
to exonerate Craig.

850
00:25:55,429 --> 00:25:59,475
Exonerate? That is a big word,

851
00:25:55,429 --> 00:25:59,475
particularly in your case.

852
00:25:59,475 --> 00:26:02,311
But there will be

853
00:25:59,475 --> 00:26:02,311
no deal.

854
00:26:02,311 --> 00:26:04,604
There is no money

855
00:26:02,311 --> 00:26:04,604
with which to make a deal.

856
00:26:07,525 --> 00:26:12,905
Can we all three just parachute

857
00:26:07,525 --> 00:26:12,905
down from Cloud Cuckooland?

858
00:26:12,905 --> 00:26:16,283
Because we know without

859
00:26:12,905 --> 00:26:16,283
question there is money.

860
00:26:16,283 --> 00:26:18,952
I distinctly remember

861
00:26:16,283 --> 00:26:18,952
a spirited game

862
00:26:18,952 --> 00:26:20,662
of tug-of-war

863
00:26:18,952 --> 00:26:20,662
over this money,

864
00:26:20,662 --> 00:26:23,082
money which we then

865
00:26:20,662 --> 00:26:23,082
discussed at length.

866
00:26:23,082 --> 00:26:26,460
You made many excuses justifying

867
00:26:23,082 --> 00:26:26,460
your possession of said money.

868
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:28,586
It's there. It exists--

869
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:28,586
BETSY: But that--

870
00:26:28,586 --> 00:26:31,882
Shh, shh! Just,

871
00:26:28,586 --> 00:26:31,882
please, for my own sanity.

872
00:26:31,882 --> 00:26:34,218
You can't hide

873
00:26:31,882 --> 00:26:34,218
a big bag of cash forever,

874
00:26:34,218 --> 00:26:37,304
and you certainly will never

875
00:26:34,218 --> 00:26:37,304
be able to spend any of it.

876
00:26:37,304 --> 00:26:39,639
So go back to HHM,

877
00:26:39,639 --> 00:26:41,434
apologize to Ms. Wexler,

878
00:26:41,434 --> 00:26:44,728
and for chrissakes,

879
00:26:41,434 --> 00:26:44,728
take the deal.

880
00:26:46,688 --> 00:26:48,982
If there were any money--

881
00:26:46,688 --> 00:26:48,982
Lady, enough.

882
00:26:48,982 --> 00:26:52,652
If there were any money,

883
00:26:52,652 --> 00:26:55,613
there would have to be

884
00:26:52,652 --> 00:26:55,613
a full accounting of it.

885
00:26:55,613 --> 00:26:59,285
Every penny

886
00:26:55,613 --> 00:26:59,285
would have to be present.

887
00:26:59,285 --> 00:27:02,455
Every single penny.

888
00:27:02,455 --> 00:27:04,748
You understand?

889
00:27:05,707 --> 00:27:08,502
All of it.

890
00:27:08,502 --> 00:27:11,046
That includes the 30,000--

891
00:27:08,502 --> 00:27:11,046
Craig, yes, he gets it.

892
00:27:11,046 --> 00:27:13,340
CRAIG:

893
00:27:11,046 --> 00:27:13,340
Yeah, he gets it.

894
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:17,511
We are in this together,

895
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:17,511
Mr. McGill, come what may.

896
00:27:18,678 --> 00:27:22,891
Now, where do we begin?

897
00:27:24,935 --> 00:27:27,480
[CHATTERING

898
00:27:24,935 --> 00:27:27,480
AND PHONES RINGING]

899
00:27:45,331 --> 00:27:47,124
There you go. Kettleman.

900
00:27:47,124 --> 00:27:49,126
That's all of it.

901
00:27:47,124 --> 00:27:49,126
Where's Kim?

902
00:27:49,126 --> 00:27:51,170
Oh, we moved her over

903
00:27:49,126 --> 00:27:51,170
to the east wing.

904
00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:54,006
The east wing?

905
00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:54,006
That's the cornfield.

906
00:27:54,006 --> 00:27:56,300
Why are you sending her

907
00:27:54,006 --> 00:27:56,300
to the cornfield, Howard?

908
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:57,926
Never heard it

909
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:57,926
called that before.

910
00:27:57,926 --> 00:28:00,471
Well, that's what

911
00:27:57,926 --> 00:28:00,471
you call it.

912
00:28:00,471 --> 00:28:02,055
You're gonna

913
00:28:00,471 --> 00:28:02,055
punish her because

914
00:28:02,055 --> 00:28:03,599
you lost those

915
00:28:02,055 --> 00:28:03,599
batshit Kettlemans?

916
00:28:03,599 --> 00:28:05,476
You notice I'm

917
00:28:03,599 --> 00:28:05,476
not exactly crowing over

918
00:28:05,476 --> 00:28:06,768
how I snaked them

919
00:28:05,476 --> 00:28:06,768
away from you.

920
00:28:06,768 --> 00:28:08,646
Jimmy,

921
00:28:06,768 --> 00:28:08,646
here are your files.

922
00:28:08,646 --> 00:28:12,690
I'm not gonna discuss

923
00:28:08,646 --> 00:28:12,690
my employee policies with you.

924
00:28:12,690 --> 00:28:16,069
I'm gonna need some help here.

925
00:28:12,690 --> 00:28:16,069
Yeah.

926
00:28:16,069 --> 00:28:18,113
You sure are.

927
00:28:55,359 --> 00:28:57,653
JIMMY:

928
00:28:55,359 --> 00:28:57,653
That prick firing you?

929
00:28:57,653 --> 00:29:00,113
KIM:

930
00:28:57,653 --> 00:29:00,113
Best-case scenario

931
00:28:57,653 --> 00:29:00,113
is my two-year plan

932
00:29:00,113 --> 00:29:02,241
just became

933
00:29:00,113 --> 00:29:02,241
a ten-year plan.

934
00:29:02,241 --> 00:29:04,826
JIMMY:

935
00:29:02,241 --> 00:29:04,826
That schmuck.

936
00:29:02,241 --> 00:29:04,826
You didn't do anything wrong.

937
00:29:04,826 --> 00:29:07,787
KIM: I lost a client.

938
00:29:04,826 --> 00:29:07,787
JIMMY: Not your fault.

939
00:29:07,787 --> 00:29:11,542
They're not really playing with

940
00:29:07,787 --> 00:29:11,542
a full deck, those Kettlemans.

941
00:29:11,542 --> 00:29:14,753
You had to take their case?

942
00:29:11,542 --> 00:29:14,753
I'm sorry, okay? I tried.

943
00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:17,005
I really did.

944
00:29:17,005 --> 00:29:19,258
I'm not being fair.

945
00:29:17,005 --> 00:29:19,258
Of course you tried.

946
00:29:19,258 --> 00:29:22,135
They'll do

947
00:29:19,258 --> 00:29:22,135
what they wanna do.

948
00:29:24,722 --> 00:29:27,057
Hope you didn't

949
00:29:24,722 --> 00:29:27,057
promise them too much.

950
00:29:27,057 --> 00:29:28,267
I doubt you'll be able to do

951
00:29:28,267 --> 00:29:30,352
more for them

952
00:29:28,267 --> 00:29:30,352
than we were offering.

953
00:29:30,352 --> 00:29:32,771
You think very highly

954
00:29:30,352 --> 00:29:32,771
of my skills, obviously.

955
00:29:32,771 --> 00:29:35,857
It's not that, Jimmy.

956
00:29:32,771 --> 00:29:35,857
It's a loser case.

957
00:29:35,857 --> 00:29:39,027
That deal was

958
00:29:35,857 --> 00:29:39,027
their best chance.

959
00:29:39,027 --> 00:29:41,572
After I worked my ass off

960
00:29:39,027 --> 00:29:41,572
finagling with the DA,

961
00:29:41,572 --> 00:29:43,741
it's just, like...

962
00:29:41,572 --> 00:29:43,741
Whatever.

963
00:29:43,741 --> 00:29:45,492
There's gotta be a way,

964
00:29:43,741 --> 00:29:45,492
you know?

965
00:29:45,492 --> 00:29:49,079
I take it to court--

966
00:29:45,492 --> 00:29:49,079
