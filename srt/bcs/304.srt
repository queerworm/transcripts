539
00:41:33,032 --> 00:41:34,533
Shall I change it, or--?

540
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:36,660
If you would.

541
00:41:41,999 --> 00:41:47,880
"Destroyed item of personal property."

542
00:41:48,047 --> 00:41:49,298
There.

543
00:41:49,465 --> 00:41:51,759
HAY:
Can you initial it, please?

544
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:54,553
J-M-M.

545
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:56,430
Initialed.

546
00:41:57,848 --> 00:42:02,686
Charles, was there anything else you found
wanting in your brother's statement?

547
00:42:04,438 --> 00:42:05,439
No.

548
00:42:05,606 --> 00:42:07,066
We're satisfied. Thank you.

549
00:42:09,735 --> 00:42:12,238
All right, so we're all set?

550
00:42:12,404 --> 00:42:14,073
No, not all set, Mr. McGill.

551
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:17,159
Your brother may be satisfied, but I am not.

552
00:42:17,326 --> 00:42:22,957
The confession you've written is adequate,
but frankly, I sense a lack of remorse.

553
00:42:23,123 --> 00:42:26,252
And I, for one,
would like to hear an apology.

554
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:29,004
Charles deserves at least that much.

555
00:42:29,505 --> 00:42:31,006
Uh....

556
00:42:31,465 --> 00:42:34,635
-Now?
-Yes, Mr. McGill, now.

557
00:42:38,681 --> 00:42:40,224
Okay.

[CLEARS THROAT]

559
00:42:41,850 --> 00:42:42,935
I was wrong--

560
00:42:43,102 --> 00:42:46,605
Mr. McGill, could you at least
look your brother in the eye?

561
00:42:56,407 --> 00:42:57,908
Chuck...

562
00:42:59,868 --> 00:43:01,912
...I'm very sorry.

563
00:43:02,705 --> 00:43:05,624
I lost my temper and I did some things...

564
00:43:05,791 --> 00:43:08,961
...so many things that I regret.

565
00:43:09,545 --> 00:43:13,340
I shouldn't have broken down your door.

566
00:43:13,716 --> 00:43:17,511
Doesn't matter how I was provoked.

567
00:43:18,304 --> 00:43:20,973
I shouldn't have done that.
There's no excuse for that...

568
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:24,852
...or for the things that I said.

569
00:43:25,102 --> 00:43:26,228
[CLEARS THROAT]

570
00:43:26,437 --> 00:43:27,563
I regret it all.

571
00:43:28,606 --> 00:43:30,774
All of it, more than you can imagine...

572
00:43:31,233 --> 00:43:32,818
...because--

573
00:43:34,069 --> 00:43:35,654
Because you're my brother...

574
00:43:35,863 --> 00:43:40,326
...and no one should treat
his own brother like that.

575
00:43:40,492 --> 00:43:42,536
Not ever.

576
00:43:45,205 --> 00:43:46,832
Okay?

577
00:43:48,792 --> 00:43:50,336
HAY:
All right, then.

578
00:43:50,586 --> 00:43:52,087
On to the matter of restitution.

579
00:43:52,254 --> 00:43:56,008
Mr. McGill, according to your agreement,
you have two weeks to pay your brother--

580
00:43:56,175 --> 00:43:58,594
I would like to pay up now, if I may?

581
00:43:58,761 --> 00:44:00,346
HAY:
You may.

582
00:44:00,929 --> 00:44:03,807
The amount is $321.

583
00:44:03,974 --> 00:44:05,976
Uh, Ms. Hay, I'm sorry.

584
00:44:06,143 --> 00:44:08,979
That figure doesn't represent
a full accounting.

585
00:44:09,146 --> 00:44:13,692
-Oh, no?
-I believe the correct amount is $323.98.

586
00:44:14,735 --> 00:44:16,945
That includes the cassette tape...

587
00:44:17,112 --> 00:44:18,447
...which was destroyed.

588
00:44:18,614 --> 00:44:19,657
HAY:
Good. Thank you.

589
00:44:19,823 --> 00:44:23,035
Three hundred twenty-three dollars
and 98 cents...

590
00:44:23,202 --> 00:44:26,830
...including the cassette tape.

591
00:44:48,102 --> 00:44:50,145
What do you say we get you home?

592
00:44:51,647 --> 00:44:53,732
Howard. Chuck.

593
00:44:53,899 --> 00:44:56,610
I'm putting you both on notice
regarding the bar hearing.

594
00:44:56,819 --> 00:44:59,113
First, I'm filing a motion
to suppress that tape.

595
00:44:59,279 --> 00:45:01,949
The tape that Jimmy destroyed, you mean.

596
00:45:02,116 --> 00:45:05,119
How about we stop with the games?
No way there isn't a duplicate.

597
00:45:05,327 --> 00:45:06,453
Really?

598
00:45:06,620 --> 00:45:08,038
Of course there is.

599
00:45:09,081 --> 00:45:11,500
You knew Jimmy was gonna break in.
You wanted him to.

600
00:45:11,667 --> 00:45:15,045
There's no way you'd let him destroy
the only copy. You made a duplicate.

601
00:45:15,629 --> 00:45:17,256
-It's the first thing you did.
-Kim.

602
00:45:17,423 --> 00:45:18,924
This is not how we do discovery.

603
00:45:19,091 --> 00:45:21,927
Actually, Jimmy destroyed the duplicate.

604
00:45:22,010 --> 00:45:24,555
Uh, it's fine, Howard.

605
00:45:24,721 --> 00:45:28,725
The original is under lock and key, and
in due time, it will be put into evidence...

606
00:45:28,892 --> 00:45:30,310
...for your review.

607
00:45:30,477 --> 00:45:33,605
So, of course, file whatever motions
you'd like. It's your privilege.

608
00:45:33,772 --> 00:45:36,400
-I will. Count on it.
-But, Kim...

609
00:45:36,608 --> 00:45:40,737
...you should be aware, because I believe
this'll be your first disciplinary hearing...

610
00:45:40,904 --> 00:45:46,493
...the Bar Association's standard of proof
is far more lenient than what you're used to.

611
00:45:46,660 --> 00:45:50,706
Motions aside, that tape will be played.

612
00:45:51,748 --> 00:45:52,958
Chuck?

613
00:45:53,125 --> 00:45:54,168
See you, Kim.

614
00:46:16,940 --> 00:46:18,400
Well?

615
00:46:20,777 --> 00:46:22,362
What?

616
00:46:23,030 --> 00:46:24,573
Bingo.
