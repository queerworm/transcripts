00:22:13,415 --> 00:22:16,460
we could guarantee you,

582
00:22:13,415 --> 00:22:16,460
say, 20 percent

583
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:19,755
of the common fund share

584
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:19,755
of the final settlement.

585
00:22:19,755 --> 00:22:22,091
That will work.

586
00:22:22,091 --> 00:22:23,843
That's a few years

587
00:22:22,091 --> 00:22:23,843
down the road.

588
00:22:23,843 --> 00:22:26,595
As for money for you now, uh,

589
00:22:26,595 --> 00:22:29,056
we don't do referral fees.

590
00:22:26,595 --> 00:22:29,056
Chuck will agree.

591
00:22:29,056 --> 00:22:30,766
HHM doesn't view

592
00:22:29,056 --> 00:22:30,766
that as ethical.

593
00:22:30,766 --> 00:22:32,185
As we discussed.

594
00:22:32,185 --> 00:22:35,188
But what we could do

595
00:22:32,185 --> 00:22:35,188
is arrange an of-counsel fee

596
00:22:35,188 --> 00:22:36,981
for the time that

597
00:22:35,188 --> 00:22:36,981
you've already put in.

598
00:22:36,981 --> 00:22:39,566
Time that you

599
00:22:36,981 --> 00:22:39,566
spent building the case.

600
00:22:39,566 --> 00:22:41,735
I think we could go

601
00:22:39,566 --> 00:22:41,735
as high as 20,000.

602
00:22:41,735 --> 00:22:46,740
That, too, will work.

603
00:22:41,735 --> 00:22:46,740
Great.

00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:49,118

Oh, got it right here.

I'm sorry?

00:22:57,835 --> 00:23:00,213

that clients love,

614
00:23:00,213 --> 00:23:02,048
but you know what?

615
00:23:02,048 --> 00:23:03,465
That's a waste of space.

Well, come on, guys.

You said this case

00:23:42,546 --> 00:23:44,215
is a slam dunk.

Yes. We want the case.

00:28:58,445 --> 00:29:00,906
supposed to work.

774
00:29:00,906 --> 00:29:06,328
I mean, who goes first?

775
00:29:00,906 --> 00:29:06,328
Do I hand over the pills first?

776
00:29:06,328 --> 00:29:10,666
Or do they give me the money

777
00:29:06,328 --> 00:29:10,666
and then I hand over the pills?

778
00:29:10,666 --> 00:29:13,960
I mean, I guess it makes sense

779
00:29:10,666 --> 00:29:13,960
if we just exchanged

780
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:18,090
at the same time, right?

781
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:18,090
I mean, that's fair.

782
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:21,134
Maybe we just count to three.

783
00:29:21,134 --> 00:29:23,512
Probably the less talk,

784
00:29:21,134 --> 00:29:23,512
the better.

785
00:29:23,512 --> 00:29:25,264
Right.

786
00:29:25,264 --> 00:29:29,893
Yeah. I suppose you could really

787
00:29:25,264 --> 00:29:29,893
overthink something like this.

788
00:29:29,893 --> 00:29:31,311
Yeah.

789
00:29:31,311 --> 00:29:32,479

is going to happen.

You're gonna take the money.

793
00:29:34,814 --> 00:29:37,735
You're going to count it.

794
00:29:37,735 --> 00:29:41,113

795
00:29:37,735 --> 00:29:41,113
you hand them the pills.

796
00:29:41,113 --> 00:29:43,198
Easy peasy.

797
00:29:57,421 --> 00:30:02,259
I knew we needed three guys.

798
00:29:57,421 --> 00:30:02,259
I knew it. It's a three-man job.

805
00:31:08,575 --> 00:31:10,703
Um...

806
00:31:10,703 --> 00:31:15,248
We're short 20.

807
00:31:10,703 --> 00:31:15,248

He runs with a

835
00:33:23,836 --> 00:33:26,797

836
00:33:26,797 --> 00:33:29,508
This deal he's doing with you,

837
00:33:26,797 --> 00:33:29,508
he's doing outside his crew.

00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:35,722
that things go very smoothly.

Wait. I'm not a bad guy.

847
00:33:44,523 --> 00:33:47,609
I didn't say you were a bad guy.

848
00:33:44,523 --> 00:33:47,609
I said you're a criminal.

849
00:33:48,777 --> 00:33:50,654
What's the difference?

850
00:33:50,654 --> 00:33:53,323

851
00:33:50,654 --> 00:33:53,323

You can go home today with your

859

money and never do this again.

860
00:34:08,129 --> 00:34:11,008

861

that wasn't yours.

862

00:39:12,725 --> 00:39:15,603
Oh. Jimmy.

967
00:39:15,603 --> 00:39:18,148
Hey.

968
00:39:15,603 --> 00:39:18,148
Jesus, when did you come in?

969
00:39:18,148 --> 00:39:22,527
I don't know.

970
00:39:18,148 --> 00:39:22,527
I left my watch outside.

971
00:39:22,527 --> 00:39:26,447
Maybe an hour ago.

972
00:39:22,527 --> 00:39:26,447
You doing some ironing?

973
00:39:26,447 --> 00:39:27,991
Yeah.

974
00:39:29,951 --> 00:39:34,413
Hey, I know things

975
00:39:29,951 --> 00:39:34,413
didn't go well for us yesterday.

976
00:39:34,413 --> 00:39:38,376
But being back in the office

977
00:39:34,413 --> 00:39:38,376
sure felt good, really good.

978
00:39:38,376 --> 00:39:41,796
I'm gonna be prepared in case

979
00:39:38,376 --> 00:39:41,796
any more work comes my way.

980
00:39:41,796 --> 00:39:44,341
And the space blanket

981
00:39:41,796 --> 00:39:44,341
lining in the suit,

982
00:39:44,341 --> 00:39:46,592
what a fantastic idea.

983
00:39:46,592 --> 00:39:50,680
It really made being outside

984
00:39:46,592 --> 00:39:50,680
much more tolerable.

985
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:52,390
I'm thinking about taking

986
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:52,390
a little walk

987
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:54,809
around the block later on.

988
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:54,809
Ha, ha.

989
00:39:54,809 --> 00:39:57,896
That's great, Chuck.

990
00:39:54,809 --> 00:39:57,896
You should do that.

991
00:40:00,565 --> 00:40:04,069
Jimmy, are you all right?

992
00:40:04,069 --> 00:40:07,697
Well, I didn't sleep

993
00:40:04,069 --> 00:40:07,697
last night, so...

994
00:40:07,697 --> 00:40:12,994
I was doing some soul searching,

995
00:40:07,697 --> 00:40:12,994
and I came to a decision.

996
00:40:12,994 --> 00:40:15,788
I'm gonna take that deal.

997
00:40:15,788 --> 00:40:20,043
You're sure?

998
00:40:15,788 --> 00:40:20,043
This is what you want?

999
00:40:22,212 --> 00:40:24,422
Kim talked to me.

1000
00:40:24,422 --> 00:40:27,633
I got pretty nasty.

1001
00:40:24,422 --> 00:40:27,633
I'm not proud.

1002
00:40:27,633 --> 00:40:29,094
But thinking about

1003
00:40:27,633 --> 00:40:29,094
what she said,

1004
00:40:29,094 --> 00:40:33,265
I'd be a fool to pass

1005
00:40:29,094 --> 00:40:33,265
up that money.

1006
00:40:33,265 --> 00:40:35,558
It is a lot of money.

1007
00:40:37,227 --> 00:40:39,938
And I have zero interest

1008
00:40:37,227 --> 00:40:39,938
in working with Howard.

1009
00:40:39,938 --> 00:40:44,525
So it's probably best that we

1010
00:40:39,938 --> 00:40:44,525
keep to our separate sandboxes.

1011
00:40:44,525 --> 00:40:48,280
Wish it could have worked out.

1012
00:40:44,525 --> 00:40:48,280
Yeah. Imagine that, huh?

side by side storming the gates.

Righting wrongs,

1017
00:40:53,743 --> 00:40:56,413
taking down the bad guys.

1018
00:40:56,413 --> 00:40:58,415
And making a boatload

1019
00:40:56,413 --> 00:40:58,415
of money to boot.

1020
00:40:58,415 --> 00:41:00,041
That would have been great.

1021
00:41:00,041 --> 00:41:03,086
Right?

1022
00:41:00,041 --> 00:41:03,086
The very best.

1023
00:41:03,086 --> 00:41:06,172
Yeah.

1024
00:41:03,086 --> 00:41:06,172
Yeah. Heh.

1025
00:41:07,506 --> 00:41:10,927
I'll keep on Howard. Um...

1026
00:41:10,927 --> 00:41:15,140
Won't badger him, but maybe

1027
00:41:10,927 --> 00:41:15,140
I can gradually wear him down.

1028
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:17,725
Get him to come around.

1029
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:17,725

Wow. I'm so lucky

1032
00:41:19,311 --> 00:41:23,273
to have you looking out for me.

1033
00:41:23,273 --> 00:41:25,733
I'll do what I can.

1034
00:41:23,273 --> 00:41:25,733
I'm not promising anything.

1035
00:41:25,733 --> 00:41:28,445
I get it.

1036
00:41:25,733 --> 00:41:28,445
It's a long shot.

1037
00:41:28,445 --> 00:41:30,280
Hey, he might change his mind.

1038
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:31,990
Yeah?

1039
00:41:31,990 --> 00:41:35,034
Hey, maybe there

1040
00:41:31,990 --> 00:41:35,034
is a way that you could

1041
00:41:35,034 --> 00:41:38,537
get Howard

1042
00:41:35,034 --> 00:41:38,537
to change his mind.

1043
00:41:38,537 --> 00:41:40,957
How?

1044
00:41:38,537 --> 00:41:40,957
Quit.

1045
00:41:42,959 --> 00:41:46,421
Jimmy, no. No, no, no.

00:41:42,959 --> 00:41:46,421
No, no, it's perfect.

The reasons I'm never

1050
00:41:47,964 --> 00:41:50,258
gonna leave HHM.

1051
00:41:50,258 --> 00:41:52,677
But you don't have

1052
00:41:50,258 --> 00:41:52,677
to really quit.

1053
00:41:52,677 --> 00:41:55,472
Okay? You just threaten

1054
00:41:52,677 --> 00:41:55,472
to quit, right?

1055
00:41:55,472 --> 00:41:58,766
You get in a game of chicken

1056
00:41:55,472 --> 00:41:58,766
with Howard.

1057
00:41:58,766 --> 00:42:01,394
He's gotta blink,

1058
00:41:58,766 --> 00:42:01,394
or HHM goes under.

1059
00:42:01,394 --> 00:42:03,480
It's a perfect plan. Heh.

00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:07,066
If you want us working together.

1062
00:42:07,066 --> 00:42:10,487
Ahem.

1063
00:42:07,066 --> 00:42:10,487
You can make it happen easily.

1064
00:42:10,487 --> 00:42:13,739
I mean, hey, that reception

1065
00:42:10,487 --> 00:42:13,739
you got yesterday at HHM,

1066
00:42:13,739 --> 00:42:18,577
how about that, right? The whole

1067
00:42:13,739 --> 00:42:18,577
lobby of HHM applauding for you.

1068
00:42:18,577 --> 00:42:20,538
They love you.

1069
00:42:20,538 --> 00:42:22,207
Now,

1070
00:42:20,538 --> 00:42:22,207
you threaten to pull out,

1071
00:42:22,207 --> 00:42:25,460
Hamlin would be insane

1072
00:42:22,207 --> 00:42:25,460
to screw with you.

1073
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:28,963
You've got the nuclear option.

1074
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:28,963
Launch the doomsday device.

1075
00:42:28,963 --> 00:42:31,674
Game over.

1076
00:42:28,963 --> 00:42:31,674
If working with me

1077
00:42:31,674 --> 00:42:35,928
is what you really want,

1078
00:42:31,674 --> 00:42:35,928
right, Chuck?

1079
00:42:38,223 --> 00:42:40,641
You called him.

1080
00:42:40,641 --> 00:42:43,561
You called Hamlin.

1081
00:42:43,561 --> 00:42:47,440
I always turn my phone off

1082
00:42:43,561 --> 00:42:47,440
before I put it in your mailbox.

1083
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:51,944
Two nights ago, it was left on.

1084
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:51,944
Battery drained.

1085
00:42:51,944 --> 00:42:55,614
I was so damn sure that

1086
00:42:51,944 --> 00:42:55,614
I turned it off, you know.

1087
00:42:55,614 --> 00:42:58,034
Because I always do.

1088
00:42:55,614 --> 00:42:58,034
It's a habit, right? Heh.

1089
00:42:58,034 --> 00:43:00,119
So it was nagging me.

1090
00:42:58,034 --> 00:43:00,119
It was nagging me.

1091
00:43:00,119 --> 00:43:02,247
So I called the phone company.

1092
00:43:02,247 --> 00:43:06,501
Turns out there was

1093
00:43:02,247 --> 00:43:06,501
a deleted call at 2 a.m.

1094
00:43:06,501 --> 00:43:08,920
when I was asleep

1095
00:43:06,501 --> 00:43:08,920
right there.

1096
00:43:10,422 --> 00:43:13,799
And you know

1097
00:43:10,422 --> 00:43:13,799
whose number? Hamlin's.

1098
00:43:15,427 --> 00:43:17,636
The only person who could

1099
00:43:15,427 --> 00:43:17,636
have made that call

1100
00:43:17,636 --> 00:43:21,724
and deleted it is you,

1101
00:43:17,636 --> 00:43:21,724
Chuck.

1102
00:43:23,601 --> 00:43:25,895
Boy, that phone, huh?

1103
00:43:25,895 --> 00:43:28,940
Phone must have felt like

1104
00:43:25,895 --> 00:43:28,940
a blowtorch in your ear.

1105
00:43:28,940 --> 00:43:30,733
All that electricity.

1106
00:43:30,733 --> 00:43:33,694
All those radio waves right up

1107
00:43:30,733 --> 00:43:33,694
against the side of your head.

1108
00:43:33,694 --> 00:43:36,072
My God.

1109
00:43:36,072 --> 00:43:37,865
What was so important

1110
00:43:36,072 --> 00:43:37,865
that you had

1111
00:43:37,865 --> 00:43:40,535
to call Howard

1112
00:43:37,865 --> 00:43:40,535
before our meeting?

1113
00:43:40,535 --> 00:43:42,370
The only thing I can think--

1114
00:43:42,370 --> 00:43:47,959
The only thing that makes sense

1115
00:43:42,370 --> 00:43:47,959
is you told him not to hire me.

1116
00:43:47,959 --> 00:43:51,170
It was always you, right?

1117
00:43:51,170 --> 00:43:53,256
Right back to when

1118
00:43:51,170 --> 00:43:53,256
I passed the bar

1119
00:43:53,256 --> 00:43:58,261
and tried to join the firm.

1120
00:43:53,256 --> 00:43:58,261
You didn't want me.

1121
00:43:58,261 --> 00:43:59,929
Speak up.

1122
00:43:59,929 --> 00:44:02,932
Tell me why.

1123
00:44:02,932 --> 00:44:05,059
It's the least

1124
00:44:02,932 --> 00:44:05,059
you can do for me now.

1125
00:44:05,059 --> 00:44:06,561
I'm your brother.

1126
00:44:06,561 --> 00:44:09,188
We're supposed to

1127
00:44:06,561 --> 00:44:09,188
look out for each other.

1128
00:44:09,188 --> 00:44:12,775
Why were you

1129
00:44:09,188 --> 00:44:12,775
working against me, Chuck?

1130
00:44:14,652 --> 00:44:17,863
You're not

1131
00:44:14,652 --> 00:44:17,863
a real lawyer.

1132
00:44:17,863 --> 00:44:19,240
I'm what?

1133
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:22,452
You're not a real lawyer.

University of American Samoa,

1135
00:44:22,452 --> 00:44:25,746
for Christ's sake.

1136
00:44:25,746 --> 00:44:28,666
An online course? What a joke.

1137
00:44:28,666 --> 00:44:31,127
I worked my ass off

1138
00:44:28,666 --> 00:44:31,127
to get where I am.

1139
00:44:31,127 --> 00:44:32,462
And you take these shortcuts

1140
00:44:32,462 --> 00:44:34,464
and you think suddenly

1141
00:44:32,462 --> 00:44:34,464
you're my peer?

1142
00:44:34,464 --> 00:44:36,090
You do what I do

1143
00:44:34,464 --> 00:44:36,090
because you're funny

1144
00:44:36,090 --> 00:44:37,467
and you can make

1145
00:44:36,090 --> 00:44:37,467
people laugh?

1146
00:44:37,467 --> 00:44:40,886
I committed my life to this!

1147
00:44:40,886 --> 00:44:43,973
You don't slide into it

1148
00:44:40,886 --> 00:44:43,973
like a cheap pair of slippers

1149
00:44:43,973 --> 00:44:46,267
and reap all the rewards.

1150
00:44:46,267 --> 00:44:48,060
I thought you were proud of me.

1151
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:49,854
I was.

1152
00:44:49,854 --> 00:44:52,273
When you straightened out

1153
00:44:49,854 --> 00:44:52,273
and got a job in the mailroom,

1154
00:44:52,273 --> 00:44:53,650
I was very proud.

1155
00:44:53,650 --> 00:44:55,318
So that's it then, right?

1156
00:44:55,318 --> 00:44:57,069
Keep old Jimmy

1157
00:44:55,318 --> 00:44:57,069
down in the mailroom.

1158
00:44:57,069 --> 00:45:00,156
He's not good enough

1159
00:44:57,069 --> 00:45:00,156
to be a lawyer.

1160
00:45:00,156 --> 00:45:02,492
I know you.

1161
00:45:02,492 --> 00:45:04,494
I know what you were,

1162
00:45:02,492 --> 00:45:04,494
what you are.

1163
00:45:04,494 --> 00:45:07,413
People don't change.

1164
00:45:04,494 --> 00:45:07,413
You're Slippin' Jimmy.

1165
00:45:07,413 --> 00:45:09,499
And Slippin' Jimmy

1166
00:45:07,413 --> 00:45:09,499
I can handle just fine.

1167
00:45:09,499 --> 00:45:11,042
But Slippin' Jimmy

1168
00:45:09,499 --> 00:45:11,042
with a law degree

1169
00:45:11,042 --> 00:45:13,252
is like a chimp

1170
00:45:11,042 --> 00:45:13,252
with a machine gun.

1171
00:45:13,252 --> 00:45:15,712
The law is sacred!

1172
00:45:15,712 --> 00:45:18,299
If you abuse that power,

1173
00:45:15,712 --> 00:45:18,299
people get hurt.

1174
00:45:18,299 --> 00:45:20,717
This is not a game.

1175
00:45:20,717 --> 00:45:22,928
You have to know--

1176
00:45:20,717 --> 00:45:22,928
On some level,

1177
00:45:22,928 --> 00:45:24,847
I know you know I'm right.

1178
00:45:24,847 --> 00:45:26,516
You know I'm right.

1179
00:45:34,566 --> 00:45:37,276
I...

1180
00:45:37,276 --> 00:45:40,279
I got you

1181
00:45:37,276 --> 00:45:40,279
a 20-pound bag of ice.

1182
00:45:40,279 --> 00:45:43,115
And some bacon,

1183
00:45:40,279 --> 00:45:43,115
and some eggs,

1184
00:45:43,115 --> 00:45:46,327
and a couple of those

1185
00:45:43,115 --> 00:45:46,327
steaks that you like.

1186
00:45:46,327 --> 00:45:49,288
Some fuel canisters. It's enough

1187
00:45:46,327 --> 00:45:49,288
for three or four days.

1188
00:45:49,288 --> 00:45:53,792
After that,

1189
00:45:49,288 --> 00:45:53,792
you're on your own.

1190
00:45:54,793 --> 00:45:56,921
I am done.

1191
00:45:58,130 --> 00:46:00,799
Jimmy.

1192
00:46:00,799 --> 00:46:02,594
Jimmy.

1193
00:46:12,061 --> 00:46:13,770
Jimmy.

1194
00:46:15,064 --> 00:46:17,358
Jimmy, come back inside.

1195
00:46:21,654 --> 00:46:24,365
Jimmy.

1196
00:46:24,365 --> 00:46:26,200
Jimmy.

1197
00:46:42,675 --> 00:46:45,386
[♪♪♪]
