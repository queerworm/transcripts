194
00:05:39,298 --> 00:05:41,091
Six left.

195
00:05:41,091 --> 00:05:43,551
Can we get more?

196
00:05:41,091 --> 00:05:43,551
God, I hope so.

197
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:45,220
It's like a license

198
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:45,220
to print money.

199
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:47,346
Heh. Thing of beauty.

200
00:05:47,346 --> 00:05:50,892
Hey, what was that crazy stuff

201
00:05:47,346 --> 00:05:50,892
about roundhouse kicks?

202
00:05:50,892 --> 00:05:53,103
Where did you get that?

203
00:05:50,892 --> 00:05:53,103
I don't know.

204
00:05:53,103 --> 00:05:56,064
Just something in my brain,

205
00:05:53,103 --> 00:05:56,064
you know? It just came out.

206
00:05:56,064 --> 00:05:58,399
Too much?

207
00:05:56,064 --> 00:05:58,399
No, I loved it.

208
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:03,113
It was, like,

209
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:03,113
deep or something.

210
00:06:03,113 --> 00:06:06,200
Wanna talk about

211
00:06:03,113 --> 00:06:06,200
brilliant, I mean...

212
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,451
You're the man.

213
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,451
Me, I'm just...

214
00:06:08,451 --> 00:06:11,163
I love

215
00:06:08,451 --> 00:06:11,163
watching you work, man.

216
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:17,460
It's good for making beer money.

217
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:17,460
That's about all.

218
00:06:18,377 --> 00:06:20,421
<i>â™ª You can smile â™ª</i>

219
00:06:20,421 --> 00:06:23,008
<i>â™ª That's all right</i>

220
00:06:20,421 --> 00:06:23,008
<i>My friend â™ª</i>

221
00:06:25,677 --> 00:06:28,013
[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

222
00:06:43,611 --> 00:06:45,364
BETSY:

223
00:06:43,611 --> 00:06:45,364
Please, no one has to know.

224
00:06:45,364 --> 00:06:47,824
You could just pretend

225
00:06:45,364 --> 00:06:47,824
you didn't find us.

226
00:06:47,824 --> 00:06:50,160
We would never tell anyone,

227
00:06:47,824 --> 00:06:50,160
would we, Craig?

228
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,912
CRAIG: No, absolutely not.

229
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,912
BETSY: No.

230
00:06:51,912 --> 00:06:54,122
I already called

231
00:06:51,912 --> 00:06:54,122
your lawyer.

232
00:06:54,122 --> 00:06:57,292
Besides, this little

233
00:06:54,122 --> 00:06:57,292
family outing of yours

234
00:06:57,292 --> 00:06:59,253
has put an innocent man

235
00:06:57,292 --> 00:06:59,253
in jail.

236
00:06:59,253 --> 00:07:01,755
The cops are investigating this

237
00:06:59,253 --> 00:07:01,755
as a kidnapping.

238
00:07:01,755 --> 00:07:05,717
They already rounded up

239
00:07:01,755 --> 00:07:05,717
some poor suspect.

240
00:07:05,717 --> 00:07:07,886
A working-class guy.

241
00:07:07,886 --> 00:07:09,971
A father, I think.

242
00:07:09,971 --> 00:07:13,934
But anyway, you two, you almost

243
00:07:09,971 --> 00:07:13,934
ruined someone's life.

244
00:07:13,934 --> 00:07:16,019
Potentially several someones.

245
00:07:16,019 --> 00:07:17,562
We had no idea.

246
00:07:17,562 --> 00:07:21,191
Could this have been

247
00:07:17,562 --> 00:07:21,191
the person in the van?

248
00:07:21,191 --> 00:07:24,069
What if the man they arrested

249
00:07:21,191 --> 00:07:24,069
is the one we were warned about?

250
00:07:24,069 --> 00:07:27,614
Yeah, maybe he's not

251
00:07:24,069 --> 00:07:27,614
so innocent. Hm?

252
00:07:27,614 --> 00:07:29,408
Warned? Warned how?

253
00:07:29,408 --> 00:07:33,161
BETSY:

254
00:07:29,408 --> 00:07:33,161
We had a phone call.

255
00:07:29,408 --> 00:07:33,161
Someone disguising their voice.

256
00:07:33,161 --> 00:07:34,871
They said someone

257
00:07:33,161 --> 00:07:34,871
was coming for us.

258
00:07:34,871 --> 00:07:37,207
And there was a van

259
00:07:34,871 --> 00:07:37,207
outside the house,

260
00:07:37,207 --> 00:07:39,751
as if whoever was inside

261
00:07:37,207 --> 00:07:39,751
was watching us.

262
00:07:39,751 --> 00:07:42,254
Mm-hm.

263
00:07:39,751 --> 00:07:42,254
And once that drove off,

264
00:07:42,254 --> 00:07:44,464
we did what we did.

265
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:46,007
For the kids.

266
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:46,007
The kids.

267
00:07:46,007 --> 00:07:49,344
I wouldn't know

268
00:07:46,007 --> 00:07:49,344
about any of that, I just--

269
00:07:49,344 --> 00:07:52,889
Ahem. I can assure you that

270
00:07:49,344 --> 00:07:52,889
you and your family are safe.

271
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:54,641
The police are all over

272
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:54,641
this thing, so...

273
00:07:54,641 --> 00:07:56,226
BETSY:

274
00:07:54,641 --> 00:07:56,226
It doesn't matter.

275
00:07:56,226 --> 00:07:58,770
We can't just go back.

276
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:02,732
Our case.

277
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:02,732
They'll crucify Craig.

278
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:04,651
Can't you just call

279
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:04,651
Ms. Wexler again?

280
00:08:04,651 --> 00:08:07,112
Tell her you didn't

281
00:08:04,651 --> 00:08:07,112
see us after all.

282
00:08:07,112 --> 00:08:08,822
If they think I ran away,

283
00:08:08,822 --> 00:08:11,074
it'll look like

284
00:08:08,822 --> 00:08:11,074
I did something wrong.

285
00:08:11,074 --> 00:08:12,826
Yeah, and we can't risk

286
00:08:11,074 --> 00:08:12,826
losing everything

287
00:08:12,826 --> 00:08:15,578
just because

288
00:08:12,826 --> 00:08:15,578
of some teensy mistake.

289
00:08:15,578 --> 00:08:16,913
Can I ask you something?

290
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:19,207
What were you hoping

291
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:19,207
would happen?

292
00:08:19,207 --> 00:08:22,377
I mean, before I found you,

293
00:08:19,207 --> 00:08:22,377
what were you planning to do?

294
00:08:22,377 --> 00:08:25,046
Well, we were in the process

295
00:08:22,377 --> 00:08:25,046
of, you know,

296
00:08:25,046 --> 00:08:26,506
working that out,

297
00:08:25,046 --> 00:08:26,506
when you, um...

298
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:28,758
We were working that out,

299
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:28,758
yeah.

300
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:31,345
All right, well,

301
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:31,345
you've still got

302
00:08:31,345 --> 00:08:33,805
a little bit of maneuverability,

303
00:08:31,345 --> 00:08:33,805
all right?

304
00:08:33,805 --> 00:08:35,432
You're outdoorsy, right?

305
00:08:35,432 --> 00:08:37,225
So you went on

306
00:08:35,432 --> 00:08:37,225
an impromptu camping trip.

307
00:08:37,225 --> 00:08:40,770
I don't know, it's something

308
00:08:37,225 --> 00:08:40,770
people do, apparently. Uh...

309
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:42,272
You left the house a mess,

310
00:08:42,272 --> 00:08:43,898
and you kicked in

311
00:08:42,272 --> 00:08:43,898
your own front door

312
00:08:43,898 --> 00:08:47,277
because it's a free country.

313
00:08:47,277 --> 00:08:49,863
Kim Wexler is very good.

314
00:08:47,277 --> 00:08:49,863
She'll make it work.

315
00:08:49,863 --> 00:08:52,032
What about the money?

316
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:56,577
If she knows about it,

317
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:56,577
she'll tell. Right?

318
00:08:56,577 --> 00:08:58,913
I mean,

319
00:08:56,577 --> 00:08:58,913
she'll have to tell.

320
00:08:58,913 --> 00:09:01,166
Well, like they say

321
00:08:58,913 --> 00:09:01,166
in Silicon Valley,

322
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:03,751
"It's not a bug,

323
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:03,751
it's a feature."

324
00:09:03,751 --> 00:09:06,421
You ever hear of

325
00:09:03,751 --> 00:09:06,421
a bargaining chip?

326
00:09:06,421 --> 00:09:07,797
What we have

327
00:09:06,421 --> 00:09:07,797
right here

328
00:09:07,797 --> 00:09:09,924
is the mother

329
00:09:07,797 --> 00:09:09,924
of all bargaining chips.

330
00:09:09,924 --> 00:09:12,344
As in...

331
00:09:12,344 --> 00:09:14,595
you expect us

332
00:09:12,344 --> 00:09:14,595
to give this back?

333
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:19,476
We are not

334
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:19,476
giving this back.

335
00:09:19,476 --> 00:09:23,063
We are not guilty.

336
00:09:19,476 --> 00:09:23,063
This money belongs to us.

337
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:24,689
We-- Well, I mean,

338
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:24,689
Craig earned it.

339
00:09:24,689 --> 00:09:26,774
I worked very hard.

340
00:09:24,689 --> 00:09:26,774
Yeah.

341
00:09:26,774 --> 00:09:29,528
Weekends, holidays, all unpaid.

342
00:09:26,774 --> 00:09:29,528
All unpaid.

343
00:09:29,528 --> 00:09:32,531
Always. And really,

344
00:09:29,528 --> 00:09:32,531
just because you're salary

345
00:09:32,531 --> 00:09:34,241
doesn't mean

346
00:09:32,531 --> 00:09:34,241
you don't deserve overtime.

347
00:09:34,241 --> 00:09:35,700
I think

348
00:09:34,241 --> 00:09:35,700
that's only fair.

349
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,785
Really, that's what

350
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,785
this is about, right?

351
00:09:37,785 --> 00:09:39,120
Fairness.

352
00:09:37,785 --> 00:09:39,120
Fairness, right.

353
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,955
I mean,

354
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,955
not just what's legal.

355
00:09:40,955 --> 00:09:46,211
You wanna talk about legal,

356
00:09:40,955 --> 00:09:46,211
slavery, that used to be legal.

357
00:09:46,211 --> 00:09:49,089
Human slavery.

358
00:09:46,211 --> 00:09:49,089
So...

359
00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:53,176
Yeah, this is right up there

360
00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:53,176
with that.

361
00:10:01,726 --> 00:10:06,022
Please, just don't tell

362
00:10:01,726 --> 00:10:06,022
anyone about the money.

363
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:07,524
I can't take a bribe.

364
00:10:07,524 --> 00:10:09,401
Who would know?

365
00:10:07,524 --> 00:10:09,401
We won't tell anyone.

366
00:10:09,401 --> 00:10:11,361
Yeah, take it.

367
00:10:09,401 --> 00:10:11,361
I can't take it.

368
00:10:11,361 --> 00:10:14,239
Please, didn't you say

369
00:10:11,361 --> 00:10:14,239
that you wanted to help us?

370
00:10:14,239 --> 00:10:17,658
Just pretend you never saw

371
00:10:14,239 --> 00:10:17,658
the money. How hard is that?

372
00:10:17,658 --> 00:10:19,827
Take it.

373
00:10:19,827 --> 00:10:21,288
Take it.

374
00:10:21,288 --> 00:10:23,706
I can't--

375
00:10:21,288 --> 00:10:23,706
I can't take a bribe.

376
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:28,044
[CLEARS THROAT]

377
00:10:28,044 --> 00:10:29,796
But you know what I ca--?

378
00:10:29,796 --> 00:10:31,423
I can take a retainer.

379
00:10:32,382 --> 00:10:33,758
A retainer?

380
00:10:33,758 --> 00:10:35,260
Yeah, for my services...

381
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:37,387
as your lawyer.

382
00:10:37,387 --> 00:10:40,974
You're not our lawyer.

383
00:10:37,387 --> 00:10:40,974
Well, not yet.

384
00:10:40,974 --> 00:10:45,437
Look, I know that HHM

385
00:10:40,974 --> 00:10:45,437
