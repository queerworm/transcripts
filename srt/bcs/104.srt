00:07:17,562 --> 00:07:21,191
Could this have been

247
00:07:17,562 --> 00:07:21,191
the person in the van?

248
00:07:21,191 --> 00:07:24,069
What if the man they arrested

249
00:07:21,191 --> 00:07:24,069
is the one we were warned about?

250
00:07:24,069 --> 00:07:27,614
Yeah, maybe he's not

251
00:07:24,069 --> 00:07:27,614

Someone disguising their voice.

256
00:07:33,161 --> 00:07:34,871
They said someone

257
00:07:33,161 --> 00:07:34,871
was coming for us.

258
00:07:34,871 --> 00:07:37,207
And there was a van

259
00:07:34,871 --> 00:07:37,207
outside the house,

260
00:07:37,207 --> 00:07:39,751
as if whoever was inside

261
00:07:37,207 --> 00:07:39,751

00:07:42,254 --> 00:07:44,464
we did what we did.
