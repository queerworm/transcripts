00:43:53,881 --> 00:43:55,924
I needed clean clothes.

517
00:43:56,967 --> 00:43:58,636
What was all that?

518
00:43:58,802 --> 00:44:03,057
-Well, I'm unloading that ad time.
-But I thought you couldn't sell it.

519
00:44:03,223 --> 00:44:04,975
Well, that's the thing. I'm not.

520
00:44:05,142 --> 00:44:09,063
They pay me to make a commercial.
I throw in the airtime for free.

521
00:44:09,229 --> 00:44:10,898
-Smart.
-Yeah.

522
00:44:11,065 --> 00:44:14,818
I spent most of the day going
door to door pitching. No dice.

523
00:44:14,985 --> 00:44:18,656
Then it came to me. I'm selling
advertising. Why not advertise?

524
00:44:18,864 --> 00:44:22,451
And it worked.
I mean, TV commercials get calls.

525
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:26,538
What commercial did you run?
Not-- Not "Gimme Jimmy"?

526
00:44:26,747 --> 00:44:30,209
No, I-- I made a new one.

527
00:44:30,959 --> 00:44:32,336
When?

528
00:44:32,503 --> 00:44:33,962
Today.

529
00:44:35,631 --> 00:44:36,674
Right here.

530
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:39,468
So you made a commercial
for commercials today?

531
00:44:39,677 --> 00:44:43,055
Yeah, I'm starting to think
I might break even here.

532
00:44:43,263 --> 00:44:44,723
[LAUGHS]

533
00:44:45,641 --> 00:44:47,976
Okay. Let's see it.

534
00:44:48,852 --> 00:44:50,145
I don't know.

535
00:44:50,312 --> 00:44:54,691
It's not my best work.
It's very last minute.

536
00:44:54,858 --> 00:44:57,528
Well, you're getting calls.
It can't be that bad.

537
00:44:57,694 --> 00:44:59,530
Yeah.

538
00:44:59,697 --> 00:45:02,866
What, now you're getting shy? Heh.

539
00:45:03,867 --> 00:45:05,661
Come on.

540
00:45:06,203 --> 00:45:08,539
Okay, but keep in mind--

541
00:45:08,705 --> 00:45:12,543
Yeah, yeah, it's not your best work.
I got it.

542
00:45:27,224 --> 00:45:30,602
<i>What's that I see?</i>
<i>Albuquerque's next TV star?</i>

543
00:45:30,811 --> 00:45:32,271
<i>It's you, small business owner.</i>

544
00:45:32,438 --> 00:45:34,690
<i>Struggling to make it</i>
<i>in today's fast-paced economy?</i>

545
00:45:34,857 --> 00:45:37,901
<i>Thought television advertising</i>
<i>was too expensive for you?</i>

546
00:45:38,068 --> 00:45:42,114
<i>Well, you better think again.</i>
<i>You can't afford not to be on TV.</i>

547
00:45:42,281 --> 00:45:44,408
<i>Look at you, you're a triple threat.</i>

548
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:47,119
<i>Great services,</i>
<i>great products, and most of all...</i>

549
00:45:47,286 --> 00:45:49,663
<i>...that face. You're a star.</i>

550
00:45:49,830 --> 00:45:54,835
<i>Wrap it all up in your natural charisma</i>
<i>and bam, you belong on TV.</i>

551
00:45:55,002 --> 00:45:58,130
<i>Better watch out for</i>
<i>autograph hounds and paparazzi.</i>

552
00:45:58,297 --> 00:46:00,883
<i>And it gets better.</i>
<i>I can have you on the air tomorrow.</i>

553
00:46:01,049 --> 00:46:02,926
<i>You heard me right. Tomorrow.</i>

554
00:46:03,093 --> 00:46:05,471
<i>Better get ready to be famous,</i>
<i>Albuquerque.</i>

555
00:46:05,637 --> 00:46:08,640
<i>I can make you a TV star</i>
<i>for a price you can afford.</i>

556
00:46:08,891 --> 00:46:10,267
<i>Call me, Saul Goodman.</i>

557
00:46:10,434 --> 00:46:13,145
<i>The world needs to know</i>
<i>about you and your business.</i>

558
00:46:13,312 --> 00:46:14,688
<i>Call me now.</i>

559
00:46:18,609 --> 00:46:22,362
The guy at the station said he's never
seen so many star wipes in a row.

560
00:46:22,529 --> 00:46:24,865
It's never been done.

561
00:46:27,034 --> 00:46:28,410
KIM:
Saul Goodman?

562
00:46:28,577 --> 00:46:31,538
Yeah, it's like, "It's all good, man."
Heh.

563
00:46:31,705 --> 00:46:34,541
-That guy has a lot of energy.
-Yeah.

564
00:46:35,125 --> 00:46:37,211
It's just a name.

565
00:46:41,048 --> 00:46:42,466
Huh.

566
00:46:50,641 --> 00:46:52,559
