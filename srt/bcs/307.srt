That moron takes the bet.

He's a fool. Look.

-Is it wrong?
-Wait, this guy over here.

00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:00,963
Yeah. He wants everyone
to know what a big spender he is.

...who's donating to my charity.

533
00:39:09,347 --> 00:39:11,057
Kevin Costner.

534
00:39:11,223 --> 00:39:13,351
I will go stand in that corner...

You're meeting Kevin Costner.

What? You don't look like Kevin Costner.

538
00:39:20,149 --> 00:39:22,193
I look exactly like Kevin Costner.

539

People are always coming up to me,
saying they love me in <i>Bull Durham.</i>

-Always.

-Uh, dirty martini?
-No, this is a $14 glass of puke.

off your face and get me another one?

00:40:18,791 --> 00:40:21,585
It's all it will take for him
to think you're interested.

561
00:40:21,752 --> 00:40:26,257
I'll act good and drunk, and he'll think
I'm a loser and try to steal you away.

562
00:40:26,882 --> 00:40:29,844
He will persist.

563
00:40:31,470 --> 00:40:34,014
You tell him you can't leave me. Not yet.

He'll help you ply me with booze.

How about that one?

I bet we could get him to invest...

00:49:32,135 --> 00:49:36,973
And I know--
I know you can't do anything, but...

700
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:41,103
...I'm getting run out
on this community service...

701
00:49:41,269 --> 00:49:45,816
...and I'm getting ripped off left and right.

702
00:49:46,483 --> 00:49:48,735
And my car won't start.

703
00:49:49,945 --> 00:49:53,073
My gal is disappointed in me, and...

704
00:49:53,573 --> 00:49:55,409
...my brother.

705
00:49:57,911 --> 00:50:00,539
[VOICE BREAKING]
My brother is sick.

706
00:50:01,415 --> 00:50:03,500
And he's alone.

707
00:50:05,711 --> 00:50:07,796
I spent years caring for him...

708
00:50:07,963 --> 00:50:10,549
...and now he hates me.

709
00:50:10,716 --> 00:50:14,553
He's the only family I got left,
and he hates me.

710
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:16,263
He hates my guts.

711
00:50:17,222 --> 00:50:18,598
Is this your brother Charles?

712
00:50:21,226 --> 00:50:22,811
And I pretend not to care...

713
00:50:22,978 --> 00:50:25,856
...but he's my brother. How can I not?

714
00:50:27,065 --> 00:50:29,025
He's mentally ill.

715
00:50:29,693 --> 00:50:32,571
And he's-- He's holed up in a house
with no electricity.

716
00:50:32,738 --> 00:50:36,241
He's working by the light of gas lanterns.

717
00:50:36,867 --> 00:50:39,995
He's making mistakes
with his clients. He's...

718
00:50:40,203 --> 00:50:42,831
...mixing up numbers on important documents.

719
00:50:42,998 --> 00:50:44,499
He--

720
00:50:45,459 --> 00:50:49,254
He had a complete mental breakdown
at the bar hearing.

721
00:50:49,671 --> 00:50:51,423
Your brother, he had...

722
00:50:51,590 --> 00:50:52,924
...a breakdown in court?

723
00:50:53,467 --> 00:50:55,677
It's in the transcripts.

724
00:50:58,013 --> 00:51:00,515
I'm not worried. I'm just--

725
00:51:00,766 --> 00:51:04,186
If he screws up with one more big client...

726
00:51:05,270 --> 00:51:07,063
...it's just gonna destroy him.

727
00:51:10,567 --> 00:51:11,693
Don't--

728
00:51:11,860 --> 00:51:13,069
Don't write.

729
00:51:13,278 --> 00:51:15,447
What are you writing? No, don't write.

730
00:51:15,614 --> 00:51:17,491
I-- I didn't mean to say that.

731
00:51:17,699 --> 00:51:19,159
[IN NORMAL VOICE]
I don't want him...

732
00:51:19,326 --> 00:51:21,912
...to get in trouble with you guys
because of me.

733
00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:25,749
-Right.
-I'm sorry. I'm gonna go.

734
00:51:26,625 --> 00:51:28,460
You're not gonna do anything, are you?

735
00:51:29,044 --> 00:51:31,463
I-- I wouldn't worry about it, Mr. McGill.

736
00:51:31,630 --> 00:51:33,256
But please feel better.

737
00:51:33,465 --> 00:51:35,467
I'm sorry.

738
00:51:36,551 --> 00:51:38,970
Just-- Forget.

739
00:51:54,569 --> 00:51:56,988
