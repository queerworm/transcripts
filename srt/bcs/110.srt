00:06:01,195 --> 00:06:03,780
for you too.

194
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:06,574
It's a shopping list

195
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:06,574
for Chuck.

196
00:06:06,574 --> 00:06:09,494
He's doing better, but he still

197
00:06:06,574 --> 00:06:09,494
needs deliveries every day.

198
00:06:09,494 --> 00:06:13,081
I think he'd be more comfortable

199
00:06:09,494 --> 00:06:13,081
with someone else doing it.

200
00:06:13,081 --> 00:06:14,373
I see.

201
00:06:14,373 --> 00:06:15,917
You don't have to do it

202
00:06:14,373 --> 00:06:15,917
personally.

203
00:06:15,917 --> 00:06:17,919
It just needs to get done.

204
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:21,340
It's pretty straightforward.

205
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:21,340
The ice is a pain in the ass.

206
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:23,258
But he needs it.

207
00:06:23,258 --> 00:06:25,719
I usually sneak into a motel

208
00:06:23,258 --> 00:06:25,719
and fill a garbage bag.

209
00:06:25,719 --> 00:06:29,764
But you can have whoever

210
00:06:25,719 --> 00:06:29,764
you hire just buy it.

211
00:06:29,764 --> 00:06:32,100
Most important thing

212
00:06:29,764 --> 00:06:32,100
is the newspapers.

213
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:35,270
<i>The New York Times. The Wall</i>

214
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:35,270
<i>Street Journal.</i> They're a must.

215
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:38,648
There's a newsstand on Eubank

216
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:38,648
that has both of them at 6 a.m.

217
00:06:38,648 --> 00:06:40,150
Which is good.

218
00:06:38,648 --> 00:06:40,150
He's an early riser.

219
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:42,110
<i>The Albuquerque Journal</i>

220
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:42,110
gets delivered.

221
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:44,738
But somebody still has to

222
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:44,738
bring it in for him.

223
00:06:44,738 --> 00:06:48,325
You've been doing all of this

224
00:06:44,738 --> 00:06:48,325
every day?

225
00:06:48,325 --> 00:06:51,410
For over a year?

226
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:55,207
You'll take care of this?

227
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:55,207
Absolutely.

228
00:06:55,207 --> 00:06:57,334
I'll get it done and done right.

229
00:07:02,089 --> 00:07:04,841
I always liked you, Jimmy.

230
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:08,595
Remember? I used to call you

231
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:08,595
Charlie Hustle.

232
00:07:08,595 --> 00:07:12,266
Yeah, I remember that.

233
00:07:23,318 --> 00:07:26,571
JIMMY:

234
00:07:23,318 --> 00:07:26,571
I'm sorry I yelled at you.

235
00:07:34,371 --> 00:07:37,124
That was nice.

236
00:07:37,124 --> 00:07:39,209
You sure you're all right?

237
00:07:39,209 --> 00:07:42,963
It's not a crime to let it out.

238
00:07:39,209 --> 00:07:42,963
There's nothing to let out.

239
00:07:42,963 --> 00:07:45,340
Chuck's a sick man.

240
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:47,634
That's no excuse.

241
00:07:47,634 --> 00:07:50,511
He's my brother.

242
00:07:47,634 --> 00:07:50,511
He thinks I'm a scumbag.

243
00:07:50,511 --> 00:07:53,307
There's nothing I can do

244
00:07:50,511 --> 00:07:53,307
to change that.

245
00:07:53,307 --> 00:07:56,768
What else is there to say?

246
00:07:56,768 --> 00:07:59,104
Wow, that's mature.

247
00:07:59,104 --> 00:08:01,564
Dalai Lama's got

248
00:07:59,104 --> 00:08:01,564
nothing on me.

249
00:08:05,444 --> 00:08:07,988
[BALLS RATTLING]

250
00:08:13,701 --> 00:08:19,374
O-64. As in

251
00:08:13,701 --> 00:08:19,374
"Oh, to be 64 again."

252
00:08:19,374 --> 00:08:21,918
O-64.

253
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:27,924
All right. Next up, we got N-32.

254
00:08:27,924 --> 00:08:31,011
N as in "Nancy Reagan,"

255
00:08:31,011 --> 00:08:33,554
First Lady with a lot of style.

256
00:08:33,554 --> 00:08:35,974
Anybody else seen

257
00:08:33,554 --> 00:08:35,974
<i>Hellcats of the Navy?</i>

258
00:08:35,974 --> 00:08:39,811
All right.

259
00:08:35,974 --> 00:08:39,811
No winners yet?

260
00:08:39,811 --> 00:08:44,441
Okay. Here's B-2.

261
00:08:44,441 --> 00:08:47,361
Just like the B-2 bomber,

262
00:08:44,441 --> 00:08:47,361
the Stealth.

263
00:08:47,361 --> 00:08:50,322
Probably one taking off

264
00:08:47,361 --> 00:08:50,322
over at Kirtland right now.

265
00:08:50,322 --> 00:08:54,284
We would never know

266
00:08:50,322 --> 00:08:54,284
because it's stealthy.

267
00:08:54,284 --> 00:08:56,619
Still no winners?

268
00:08:56,619 --> 00:08:58,579
No?

269
00:08:58,579 --> 00:09:00,874
Here we have

270
00:09:00,874 --> 00:09:05,795
B-4. Another B.

271
00:09:00,874 --> 00:09:05,795
How about that. As in:

272
00:09:05,795 --> 00:09:10,509
"Before too long, we're gonna

273
00:09:05,795 --> 00:09:10,509
have another winner."

274
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:14,054
No? Nobody? Okay.

275
00:09:15,514 --> 00:09:17,098
All right. Ahem.

276
00:09:17,098 --> 00:09:21,311
And here comes--

277
00:09:21,311 --> 00:09:26,858
Hey, it's our old friend B.

278
00:09:21,311 --> 00:09:26,858
Heh. B-12.

279
00:09:28,943 --> 00:09:32,697
B as in, uh...

280
00:09:32,697 --> 00:09:35,909

281
00:09:35,909 --> 00:09:37,952
"betrayal."

282
00:09:37,952 --> 00:09:43,291

284
00:09:44,251 --> 00:09:45,585
Still no winners?

285
00:09:46,753 --> 00:09:48,629
No?

286
00:09:48,629 --> 00:09:51,341
Okay.

287
00:09:51,341 --> 00:09:53,801
Here it is.

288
00:09:56,471 --> 00:09:58,932
Oh, what are the odds?

289
00:09:58,932 --> 00:10:03,644
Four B's in a row. That's...

290
00:09:58,932 --> 00:10:03,644
Heh.

291
00:10:03,644 --> 00:10:06,565
B-7.

00:10:06,565 --> 00:10:08,733
B as in...

293
00:10:10,402 --> 00:10:12,612
B as in...

00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:14,739
"brother."

295
00:10:14,739 --> 00:10:16,657
Brother.

296
00:10:18,243 --> 00:10:21,621
B-7. Seven brides

297
00:10:18,243 --> 00:10:21,621
for seven brothers.

298
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:23,540
I'm sure a lot of you

299
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:23,540
have brothers.

300
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:25,166
It's not like mine though.

301
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:30,255
Any winners yet? Take another

302
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:30,255
look, okay? I'll wait.

303
00:10:30,255 --> 00:10:32,966
I'm gonna say if it's another B,

304
00:10:32,966 --> 00:10:34,842
we could have

305
00:10:32,966 --> 00:10:34,842
a real problem here.

306
00:10:42,142 --> 00:10:43,935
And...

307
00:10:43,935 --> 00:10:47,397
Hey, it is another B.

308
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:50,942
B-5, as in:

309
00:10:50,942 --> 00:10:55,447
"Boy, this B thing is really

310
00:10:50,942 --> 00:10:55,447
starting to tick me off."

311
00:10:55,447 --> 00:11:00,160
B as in "battleship." B as

312
00:10:55,447 --> 00:11:00,160
in "bourbon." B as in "Belize."

313
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,578
Beautiful place, so I've heard.

314
00:11:03,037 --> 00:11:06,874
I would love to go there,

315
00:11:03,037 --> 00:11:06,874
but let's face it,

316
00:11:06,874 --> 00:11:08,502
that's never gonna happen.

317
00:11:08,502 --> 00:11:13,047
None of us is ever leaving

318
00:11:08,502 --> 00:11:13,047
this godforsaken wasteland.

319
00:11:17,552 --> 00:11:19,513
Sorry.

320
00:11:19,513 --> 00:11:21,473
Scratch that.

321
00:11:21,473 --> 00:11:24,601
Moving on?

322
00:11:24,601 --> 00:11:27,061
I mean,

323
00:11:24,601 --> 00:11:27,061
what is it with this place?

324
00:11:27,061 --> 00:11:29,981
It's like living

325
00:11:27,061 --> 00:11:29,981
inside an Easy Bake Oven.

326
00:11:29,981 --> 00:11:31,525
I mean, look out that window.

327
00:11:31,525 --> 00:11:33,568
It's like a soulless,

328
00:11:33,568 --> 00:11:36,446
radioactive Georgia O'Keeffe

329
00:11:33,568 --> 00:11:36,446
hellscape out there,

330
00:11:36,446 --> 00:11:39,073
crawling with coral snakes

331
00:11:36,446 --> 00:11:39,073
and scorpions, and...

332
00:11:39,073 --> 00:11:41,618
You ever see the movie

333
00:11:39,073 --> 00:11:41,618
<i>The Hills Have Eyes?</i>

334
00:11:41,618 --> 00:11:43,370
It's a documentary.

335
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:46,956
God forbid, your car breaks

336
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:46,956
down, you have to walk 10 steps.

337
00:11:46,956 --> 00:11:49,083
You have melanoma

338
00:11:46,956 --> 00:11:49,083
the size of a pineapple

339
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:52,045
where your head used to be.

340
00:11:52,045 --> 00:11:53,630
So you ask, "Why?"

341
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:58,552
Why, if that's how I feel,

342
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:58,552
why do I live here? Why?

343
00:11:58,552 --> 00:12:00,928
MAN:

344
00:11:58,552 --> 00:12:00,928
Excuse me.

345
00:12:00,928 --> 00:12:02,180
Are you gonna read that number?

346
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:05,724
Yeah.

347
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:05,724
I'm gonna read your number.

348
00:12:05,724 --> 00:12:08,520
It's another B. Ha.

349
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:15,235
It's another freaking B.

350
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:15,235
Of course. Why not? Why not?

351
00:12:16,986 --> 00:12:19,447
And the next number...

352
00:12:26,413 --> 00:12:29,624
Quick question. Who here knows

353
00:12:26,413 --> 00:12:29,624
what a Chicago Sunroof is?

354
00:12:29,624 --> 00:12:34,003
Anybody? You, sir? No? Okay.

355
00:12:34,003 --> 00:12:38,508
True story. Back home,

356
00:12:34,003 --> 00:12:38,508
there was this guy named Chet.

357
00:12:38,508 --> 00:12:40,968
Now, Chet was a real asshole.

358
00:12:40,968 --> 00:12:43,263
He might have owed me

359
00:12:40,968 --> 00:12:43,263
some money.

360
00:12:43,263 --> 00:12:46,433
He might have slept with my wife

361
00:12:46,433 --> 00:12:50,562
before she became my ex-wife.

362
00:12:46,433 --> 00:12:50,562
The details don't matter.

363
00:12:50,562 --> 00:12:54,524
Suffice it to say,

364
00:12:50,562 --> 00:12:54,524
I was wronged.

365
00:12:54,524 --> 00:12:57,068
All right.

366
00:12:54,524 --> 00:12:57,068
So one summer evening,

367
00:12:57,068 --> 00:13:00,614
I was out having a few drinks,

368
00:12:57,068 --> 00:13:00,614
one or two, maybe three. Ha.

369
00:13:00,614 --> 00:13:05,910
You get the picture.

370
00:13:00,614 --> 00:13:05,910
And who do I see? Chet.

371
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:09,497
He drove up and he double-parked

372
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:09,497
outside a Dairy Queen

373
00:13:09,497 --> 00:13:12,417
and went in to get some

374
00:13:09,497 --> 00:13:12,417
soft serve. Now, Chet drove--

375
00:13:12,417 --> 00:13:14,043
And this will give you an idea

376
00:13:14,043 --> 00:13:16,755
of exactly what kind

377
00:13:14,043 --> 00:13:16,755
of a douche bag this guy was.

378
00:13:16,755 --> 00:13:20,425
Drove a white pearlescent

379
00:13:16,755 --> 00:13:20,425
BMW 7 Series

380
00:13:20,425 --> 00:13:22,427
with white leather interior.

381
00:13:22,427 --> 00:13:27,932
Heh. So I saw that thing and

So in '64, they decide to change

00:22:26,846 --> 00:22:30,016
the Lincoln half-dollar

621
00:22:30,016 --> 00:22:31,851
into the Kennedy half-dollar.

622
00:22:31,851 --> 00:22:33,144
When they design it,

623
00:22:33,144 --> 00:22:35,688
they put Kennedy facing right,

624
00:22:33,144 --> 00:22:35,688
facing east.

625
00:22:35,688 --> 00:22:38,691

00:22:38,691 --> 00:22:40,484
East symbolizes the dawn.

It's a burial thing.

634
00:22:48,408 --> 00:22:50,995
But there's one technician

635
00:22:48,408 --> 00:22:50,995
in the Denver mint, right?

00:22:55,875 --> 00:22:58,460
it just destroyed him.

641
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:00,880
When he sees that coin

642
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:00,880
with Kennedy facing east,

643
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:04,133
facing the American past,

644
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:04,133
it pissed him off.

645
00:23:04,133 --> 00:23:06,010
And so he went rogue.

646
00:23:06,010 --> 00:23:08,762
Without telling anybody,

647
00:23:06,010 --> 00:23:08,762
he flipped things around

648
00:23:08,762 --> 00:23:11,849
so that Kennedy was facing west

649
00:23:08,762 --> 00:23:11,849

about 3000 of these

00:47:22,173 --> 00:47:23,882
We could have split it 50-50.

1324
00:47:23,882 --> 00:47:30,055
We could have gone home

1325
00:47:23,882 --> 00:47:30,055
with $800,000 each, tax free.

1326
00:47:30,055 --> 00:47:32,224
Your point being?

1327
00:47:32,224 --> 00:47:34,769
Why didn't we? What stopped us?

1328
00:47:34,769 --> 00:47:39,774
I remember you saying something

1329
00:47:34,769 --> 00:47:39,774
about doing the right thing.

1330
00:47:39,774 --> 00:47:42,401
I don't even know

1331
00:47:39,774 --> 00:47:42,401
what that means.

1332
00:47:42,401 --> 00:47:44,654
You want to know

1333
00:47:42,401 --> 00:47:44,654
why I didn't take that money?

1334
00:47:44,654 --> 00:47:46,823
Is that what

1335
00:47:44,654 --> 00:47:46,823
you're asking?

1336
00:47:46,823 --> 00:47:48,658
Yeah,

1337
00:47:46,823 --> 00:47:48,658
that's what I'm asking.

1338
00:47:48,658 --> 00:47:53,120
Me, personally, I was hired

1339
00:47:48,658 --> 00:47:53,120
to do a job. I did it.

1340
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:55,039
That's as far as it goes.

1341
00:47:55,039 --> 00:47:59,335
Yeah.

1342
00:47:55,039 --> 00:47:59,335
Well, I know what stopped me.

1343
00:47:59,335 --> 00:48:01,003
And you know what?

1344
00:48:01,003 --> 00:48:03,880
It's never stopping me again.
