Lovely.

17
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:01,280
And I believe you wrote the lyrics
yourselves, is that correct?

18
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:02,560
It is, indeed, Sister.

19
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,360
Do you ever think you might have
too much time on your hands, girls?

20
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,560
Lose the jackets.

21
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
OK, just a couple of things.

22
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:16,960
Firstly, I'd like to introduce Mae Cheung.

23
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,680
Can you make yourself known, please, Mae?

24
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:22,520
Miss Cheung's family
have recently moved here to Derry,

25
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:24,560
so, I hope you'll all
make her feel very welcome.

26
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,640
It's bound to be
a bit of a culture shock, Mae.

27
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:29,440
Things are done differently
in this part of the world,

28
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,440
but I'm sure you'll soon feel

29
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:35,120
as at home here as you
did back in your beloved Donegal.

34
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:51,720
I'm sorry, I simply cannot read this.

35
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:58,720
But before you don your glad rags
and boogie on down,

36
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:01,440
we'd like to let you in
on our little secret.

37
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:04,400
We're not actually gonna have
a school formal this year.

What?!

39
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:09,320
No, listen. We're not gonna have
a school formal.

-Wise up.

I know, I know, but I do love a theme.

45
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:23,720
Sure, isn't that why people call me
the Theme Queen?

46
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:24,840
-Do they?
-Do they fuck.

47
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:28,240
We wanted to have a real,
old school, retro, vintage vibe,

48
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:30,840
so feel free to just go for it.

49

[Clare]
There she is.

53
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:45,240
OK, so I say we just go over there
and be ourselves, girls.

54
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:48,680
Well, not totally ourselves.
We should definitely be a bit ourselves.

55
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:50,840
We could also pretend we're sort of better
than we actually are, so,

56
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:53,360
I suppose what I'm saying is we could
present a version of ourselves as less--

57
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,240
-Crap.
-Precisely.

58
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:55,680
Why do we even have to talk to her?

59
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,240
-Because she's new, Michelle.
-I hate people I don't know.

60
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:00,320
And, in case you hadn't noticed,
she also happens to be Chinese.

61
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,680
I mean, how class would it be
to have a Chinese friend?

62
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:04,960
-We could keep her in my toy box.
-No, we couldn't.

63
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,720
-She'd definitely fit.
-That is not the point.

64
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:10,880
Fine. But can we agree
it's on a strict one in, one out basis?

65
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,960
If she joins the group,
James has to leave.

66
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,240
-Course.
-Absolutely.

67
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:16,080
Excuse me?

68
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:18,240

Burnin' for you, Clare.

71
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,760
I-i-i-i-it's Cantonese.

72
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:30,080
Right. Well, I'm from Donegal,
and we speak English there.

73
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:32,720
If you say so, Mae,
but I spent a summer in Killybegs,

74
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,480
and seriously, not a fucking word.

75
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,680
We just wanted
to introduce ourselves and--

76
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:39,440
OK. I think I see where this is going.
I get this a lot.

77
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:42,520
Dull, white girls wanting me
to join their gang because, well...

78
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,000
-We're not dull.
-Sure.

79
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,040
And I'm actually a boy.

80
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:48,480
Whoa. She has a really fucked-up accent.

81
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,360
We know.

82
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,480
[sighs]
What's in this for me?

83
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,920
What are you bringing to the table?

84
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:53,920
Cream crackers?

85
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,200
I'm good for cream crackers, thank you.

86
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:58,760
I'll see you round, girls.

87
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:02,000
Maybe we don't need a Chinese person.
We've already got a lesbian.

88
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,440
What? Who?

89
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,840
-Me.
-Really?

90
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:06,520
-You don't look like a lesbian.
-What do you mean?

91
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,600
Just that you're a bit... short.

92
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:10,520
Well, there's no height restrictions...

93
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:11,920
as far as I'm aware.

94
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,440
Interesting.
I've always wanted a gay friend.

95
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,480
I mean, ideally a fella.

96
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,840
-Howdy, folks.
-Christ.

97
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,720
I'm Jenny. This is Aisling.

98
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,839
We just thought we'd
introduce ourselves and see--

99
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,519
Too late, Jenny. She's ours.

100
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:27,400
I see. Look, these girls are great,

101
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:30,080
but I do have a pen pal
from the Caribbean,

102
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:33,520
so, perhaps my circle
is a little bit more diverse.

103
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,240
Back off.

104
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:37,480
Think it over. Give me a call.

105
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:40,840
Oh, and FYI,
the Prom Queen vote closes today.

106
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,560
FY nobody gives a shit.

107
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:43,920
Here's the wee ballot.

108
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,880
I see you've thrown your hat
into the ring, Jenny.

109
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:50,040
I had my arm twisted,
but feel free to tick my box.

110
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,320
Dirty bitch.

111
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:54,800
Well, this prom is going to be
a full-blown dick-fest.

112
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,920
You know,
there isn't even gonna be a DJ.

113
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,720
Apparently, Jenny's hired
this fuckin' pensioner band.

114
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,880
Christ, really?

115
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,760
I heard the drummer is at least 30.

116
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:04,880
I don't feel so bad about missing it now.

117
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,200
It clashes with my thing.

118
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:08,120
The creep convention? Seriously?

119
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,600
It's not a creep convention.

120
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:12,880
Well, I think a load of perverts
getting together to wank over some fella

121
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:15,720
who fights with Hoovers
and rides aliens in a telephone box,

122
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:18,400
is the very fucking definition
of a creep convention.

123
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,800
It's a<i> Doctor Who </i>night.

124
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:21,920
Me and my stepdad
used to watch it when I was little.

125
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,720
Well, someone should have called
social services then, James.

126
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:26,200
You're not going to the prom then, James?

127
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:28,480
Well, I was going to ask you
to be my date.

128
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,840
I'm sorry, Clare.

129
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,920
You were going to ask James
to be your date?

130
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,200
What the fuck's wrong with you?

131
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,080
Well, it's a bit more complicated for me.

132
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,880
You're a lesbian, Clare, not desperate.

133
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,800
Now, I don't know who to ask.

134
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:39,680
Tell me about it.

135
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:42,000
There's at least five fellas
that fancy the arse off me,

136
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,080
but I just can't choose.

137
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,600
Yeah, that's definitely the same.

138
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:47,320
-I'll be your date, Clare.
-But, Erin, people might talk.

139
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,680
They might get the wrong idea.

140
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:51,440
Let them. We need to break down
these ridiculous conventions.

141
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,920
-Are you sure?
-I'd be proud to have you on my arm.

142
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,560
-Thank you.
-Oh, God.

143
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:57,080
John Paul's over there.

144
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:59,480
Christ, but it's been
so awkward since we broke up.

145
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:00,560
For fuck's sake, Erin.

146
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:03,200
He kissed your cheek
at Kerry Coyle's 16th birthday party,

147
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,280
and then passed out
in a puddle of his own boke.

148
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,960
Yeah, he missed the boat, all right.

149
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:11,120
I'm sure the fact that he's
poking a model is some consolation.

150
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,040
OK. Cara is not a model.

151
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,360
She's done some modeling.
There's a difference.

152
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,840
I heard she's gonna be on<i> Baywatch.</i>

153
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:18,240
She's not gonna be on<i> Baywatch, </i>Orla.

154
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:20,440
-I heard that too, the<i> Baywatch </i>thing.
-So did I.

155
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:22,760
They don't have people
from Derry on<i> Baywatch, </i>OK?

156
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:23,640
We're just too pasty.

157
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:26,280
Look, it was never going to work out
between me and John Paul.

158
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,480
I realize that now

159
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:30,680
because I'm looking for an
intellectual connection, and he wants--

160
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:32,520
-To ride a model.
-She is not a model.

161
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,680
-Oh, my God.
-What?

162
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:34,880
Looks like they're breaking up.

163
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,320
-I can't do this anymore.
-Why?

164
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,600
Jesus. Are they really?
Are they breaking up?

165
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:43,560
They are. They're breaking up.
This is class.

166
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:44,720
-What?
-Later.

167
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,240
Erin, what are you doing?

168
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:49,280
She has no respect for herself,
and coming from me...

169
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,080
-That is bad.
-Exactly.

170
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,080
Hey.

171
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,160
-Hey. Hey!
-Jesus Christ.

172
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,280
Sorry. What happened there was,

173
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:01,800
well, I slightly misjudged
the level of my own voice, I think.

174
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:04,160
You're grand.
I was in a world of my own.

175
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:05,960
Everything okay?

176
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,400
-Yeah, yeah.
-You sure?

177
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,680
-Oh, yeah.
-Really?

178
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:10,560
It's just, I couldn't help but notice

179
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:12,760
that you and Cara were
sort of breaking up a bit there.

180
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,680
Yeah.

181
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,080
I mean, it's all cool.

182
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,200
Really?

183
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:21,680
It was mutual.
It was definitely a mutual thing.

184
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:25,160
Although maybe she wanted to
mutually split up a bit more than I did.

185
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,160
I see.

186
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,440
Now, I'm just not sure
it was the right decision.

187
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:29,720
It definitely was.

188
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,360
We just got each other, you know.

189
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:34,560
I mean she's so cool, and smart.

190
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:36,000
Smart? Really?

191
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,360
And she's a model, for Christ's sake.

192
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,000
She's done some modeling.

193
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:42,040
I'm just wondering whether I should, like,
go after her and try and sort it out.

194
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,520
-You definitely shouldn't do that.
-Really?

195
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:46,520
Yeah, it's needy. What you should do
is take your mind off it.

196
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:49,520
Okay, cool. Sweet.

197
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,720
How?

198
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:51,760
Go out with me.

199
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:54,760
I mean, go out with us,
me and my friends.

200
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:57,080
We're going to this prom thing
on Saturday night.

201
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,720
Prom? Sounds sort of...

202
00:07:58,800 --> 00:07:59,920
-Shit?
-Formal.

203
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,760
Oh, no, it's not.
It's actually not at all.

204
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:04,520
It's actually very informal.

205
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:08,360
It's actually really, like, laid-back,
chilled, who gives an eff kind of thing.

206
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:10,880
It's not a big deal.
It's not a big deal at all.

207
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:17,280
This is a huge day.
This is a massive, massive day.

208
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:20,240
I'm going to the prom
with John Paul Riley, for God's sake.

209
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:21,480
Come on, Mammy.

210
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:24,400
I don't care if you're going to the prom
with John Paul II, Erin,

211
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:26,320
I'm not buying you another frock.
End of story.

212
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,560
But, Mammy, you don't understand.

213
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:29,120
There's nothing wrong
with your Easter dress.

214
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:31,640
There is lots of things wrong
with my Easter dress.

215
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:32,920
I mean, it matches Orla's.

216
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,200
That being the main one.

217
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:36,200
Honestly, Erin,
I think we'll look so cracker

218
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:37,919
if we both rock in wearing these.

219
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,120
Right. Well, I don't.

220
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,760
Ach, Mary, you'd think the wain's
been dropped into it.

221
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:43,480
You wouldn't nip it in a bit for her?

222
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:46,799
I'd do it myself,
but sewing plays havoc with my acrylics.

223
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:47,679
Fine.

224
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,280
I really like this fella, Mammy.

225
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,840
Well, if he really likes you,
it won't matter what you wear.

226
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:52,800
Ach, come off it.

227
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,360
Have you a date lined up, Orla?

228
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,320
I do, aye.

229
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:58,040

in our relationship.

-Doesn't mean you're in a relationship.
-We'll see about that.

00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:30,480
Erin's just sacked Clare as her prom date
so she could take a fella she fancies.

271
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,760
Bad craic, Erin. Very bad craic.

272
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,520
-That is not true.
-Isn't it?

273
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,440
Well, I mean, there is

00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:42,600
Just a wee joke there.

Great. All sorted.

OK. Now that Mae has
officially joined the group,

he is really good with his hands.

00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,880
Look, there's a guy here.
He knows Mae.

506
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:05,680
What's going on? Oh, don't tell me.

507
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,600
-Wank features stood you up.
-Yeah.

508
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:09,840
-I'm sorry, Erin.
-No, I'm sorry.

509
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:11,560
You were right. I was jealous.

510
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:14,560
Mae's just so cool and exotic,
and you liked her so much.

511
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,080
-She's deranged.
-What?

512
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:17,680
I met this guy that went to her school.

513
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:19,560
He said she had to leave
for, like, being a bully.

514
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:21,280
He said she's seriously unhinged.

515
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:24,240
I think he's a bit pissed off with her,
to be honest, and I can't blame him,

516
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:27,320
'cause she's given the Chinese population
in Donegal a really bad rap.

517
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:29,200
Typical Donegal man. Always moaning.

518
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:32,720
-There she is.
-[Michelle] What's she doing?

519
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:34,600
She was talking about how
she wasn't going to let Jenny

520
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:36,400
get away with the whole Prom Queen thing.

521
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:37,760
Jesus Christ, look.

522
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,120
Above the stage, look.

523
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,760
She's not gonna do a Carrie.

524
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:42,960
-Fuck-a-doodle-do.
-What's a Carrie? What does that mean?

525
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:44,320
-You've never seen<i> Carrie?</i>
-No.

526
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,640
-It's some film.
-Amazing.

527
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:46,920
Aye, you should check it out.

528
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,880
Expand and explain.
Expand and explain!

529
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,400
So, Carrie is voted Prom Queen,

530
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:55,080
and this bully
pours a bucket of pig's blood on her.

531
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:56,000
Jesus Christ!

532
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:59,240
I mean, lots of other stuff happens, too,
but that's the sort of relevant bit.

533
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:02,080
[microphone feedback]
Can I have your attention, please?

534
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:05,600
And now, the moment
we've all been waiting for--

535
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:08,600
it's time to crown our Prom Queen.

536
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:10,320
Holy shit.

537
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,960
How long are we supposed to
go on like this, Gerry?

538
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:13,560
I'm trying my best.

539
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:15,360
We've already missed
<i>Coronation Street.</i>

540
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,760
Well, every cloud, as they say.

541
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:18,040
I've warned you before, Gerry.

542
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:20,280
You say another bad word
about<i> Coronation Street,</i>

543
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:21,960
and you may leave this house
and never return.

544
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:23,440
And you'd have
my full backing on that, Mary.

545
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,160
God only knows what else we've missed.

546
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:26,400
We won't have missed anything.

Thank you, so much.
