00:00:16,485 --> 00:00:18,325
I just can't get my head around it.

2
00:00:19,125 --> 00:00:22,285
The fact that he's gone... forever.

3
00:00:22,365 --> 00:00:25,165
It's so sad, it really is.
It is so, so sad.

4
00:00:25,245 --> 00:00:27,725
But at the same time,
what's done is done, so let's crack on.

5
00:00:27,805 --> 00:00:29,485
Well, I'm sorry, Clare.

6
00:00:29,565 --> 00:00:33,125
Has his sudden, tragic death
interrupted your studies?

7
00:00:33,205 --> 00:00:34,485
It has a bit, actually, yeah.

8
00:00:35,765 --> 00:00:38,645
-How can you be so heartless?
-Don't cry, Erin.

9
00:00:38,725 --> 00:00:40,965
He's in a better place now.

10
00:00:41,045 --> 00:00:44,405
Unless he's not, you know,
because unless he's gone to hell.

11
00:00:44,485 --> 00:00:47,725
Can we please talk about something else?
I'm half torn. This is wrecking my head.

12
00:00:47,805 --> 00:00:50,645
-What? Have you been drinking?
-Yes, I have.

13
00:00:51,165 --> 00:00:55,045
And for future reference, if any of you
invite me to a study sleepover again,

14
00:00:55,125 --> 00:00:57,325
and I'm desperate enough
to accept that invitation,

15
00:00:57,405 --> 00:01:00,325
there's a good chance I'll have
a liter bottle of Pernod in my bag.

16
00:01:00,405 --> 00:01:02,405
I shouldn't even have to sit the exam,

17
00:01:02,485 --> 00:01:06,645
-on, you know, compassionate grounds.
-He was a dog, Erin!

18
00:01:06,725 --> 00:01:09,165
Toto was much more than a dog.

-[can hissing open]
-Toto was my best friend.

20
00:01:11,325 --> 00:01:12,765
Christ, I feel a bit bokey.

21
00:01:17,685 --> 00:01:21,725
Sweet suffering Jesus. It's the morning
already?! What are we going to do?

22
00:01:21,805 --> 00:01:23,925
Maybe we could start
with calming the fuck down.

23
00:01:24,005 --> 00:01:25,205
Calm down?

24
00:01:25,285 --> 00:01:28,565
We're still on William of Orange!
We haven't so much looked at the famine!

25
00:01:28,645 --> 00:01:31,285
We've got the gist. They ran out of spuds,
everyone was raging.

26
00:01:31,365 --> 00:01:34,285
Well, I can't tell
my rebellions from my risings.

27
00:01:34,365 --> 00:01:38,245
Whose fault's that? If your lot stopped
invading us for five fucking minutes,

28
00:01:38,325 --> 00:01:40,845
there'd be a lot less to wade through,
you English prick.

29
00:01:40,925 --> 00:01:42,885
[Clare, panting] Nothing's going in.

30
00:01:42,965 --> 00:01:45,605
Nothing is going in,
and every time I try to make notes it...

31
00:01:47,485 --> 00:01:49,285
[whispers] What's happening to me?

32
00:01:49,365 --> 00:01:51,845
There's quite a lot of caffeine in those,
Clare.

33
00:01:51,925 --> 00:01:55,205
-How many of them have you had?
-I don't know. Five? Twenty-three?

34
00:01:56,245 --> 00:01:59,405

-Who said I was gay?

How can you cheat at bingo, Granda?

Her nephew brought her this pen
back from New Jersey.

It changes the numbers.
I'm telling you, It's witchcraft, Mary.

We'll hear no more about the magic pen.

Now come on, girls, eat up. You'll need
all your energy for the big exam.

Yeah, you can't waste
Esther's time like that.

Well, it's in the weeping statue category.

00:08:12,565 --> 00:08:13,565
Sure, I know.

165
00:08:14,085 --> 00:08:16,325
Yeah, apparently there was a smirk
as well.

Before this goes any further,

before we talk to this priest,
there is something you need to know.

-Nothing. Ignore me. Forget it.

This is just going to be a very relaxed,
informal chat.

I don't want you to think of me
as a priest. Think of me as a friend.

193
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:34,005
do you guys have any questions for me?

194
00:09:34,605 --> 00:09:37,205
Is that your real eye color
or are they contacts?

195

These are my real eyes.

00:09:40,685 --> 00:09:41,685
Yes, James.

-It's a mousse.

-Hair and Flair.

No.

Does anyone have any questions about

-No, I don't think so.

-No.
-No.

206

-Not really.
-No.

207
00:10:03,725 --> 00:10:05,445
Okay, then. So you claim you saw

208
00:10:05,525 --> 00:10:08,125
our Blessed Lady's features change.
Is that right?

209
00:10:08,325 --> 00:10:11,405
The Virgin Mother smirked at us, Peter.
That is correct.

210
00:10:11,485 --> 00:10:13,725
I see. And after that,

211
00:10:13,805 --> 00:10:16,285
the statue, well,
you claim it started weeping.

212
00:10:16,365 --> 00:10:19,045
You're using the word "claim"
a lot there, Peter.

213
00:10:19,125 --> 00:10:21,165
Girls, I'm not here to make any judgments.

214

-I'm just trying to get the truth.
-You think we're lying?

-No, of course not.
-I do.

216
00:10:25,565 --> 00:10:28,005
But sometimes we want to believe in
something so much

217
00:10:28,085 --> 00:10:29,525
that we willingly deceive ourselves.

218
00:10:29,605 --> 00:10:31,685
I know I've been guilty
of that in the past.

I wanted a sign so badly
that it drove me to distraction,

220
00:10:34,365 --> 00:10:38,605
because it is the question
we all want the answer to, isn't it?

221
00:10:38,685 --> 00:10:40,405
I mean, does God exist?

222

what you were talking about?

-I remember that James was being a dick.
-Miss Mallon.

230
00:11:11,445 --> 00:11:14,845
I don't like to use that word, Sister,
but it's so hard to describe James

he's just such a dick.

The dog has nothing to do with anything.

See, Erin's dog died recently, and she saw
one that sort of looked like him a bit.

248

-The dog's irrelevant.
-So we followed him for a while.

connection, like a spark.

fucking resurrected, so, pinch of salt.

Yes, and now he's talking about
digging him up.

has not, in fact, been resurrected.

00:16:03,405 --> 00:16:04,485
Look, Clare.

334
00:16:05,245 --> 00:16:07,005
Take a long, hard look at that.

335
00:16:08,125 --> 00:16:11,285
And this is only the beginning.
The<i> Derry Journal </i>are on their way round.

336
00:16:11,365 --> 00:16:12,925
They said we could make page five.

337
00:16:13,005 --> 00:16:14,165
Erin, tell her!

338
00:16:15,285 --> 00:16:18,445
Yeah, we could tell the truth,
but I sort of like the fact

339
00:16:18,525 --> 00:16:20,845
that Peter thinks
I'm the chosen one, so...

340
00:16:20,925 --> 00:16:23,125
-James.
-I have a slight concern.

341
00:16:23,205 --> 00:16:24,525
The truth might affect

342
00:16:24,605 --> 00:16:27,005
-my friendship with Peter.
-You don't have a friendship with Peter.

343
00:16:27,085 --> 00:16:29,005
Yes, I do. We have a lot in common.

344
00:16:29,085 --> 00:16:31,485
Like what? Apart from you appear
to be wearing his clothes.

345
00:16:31,565 --> 00:16:35,045
No, the fact that we're both
very spiritual.

346
00:16:35,645 --> 00:16:38,205
But mainly the fact
that he doesn't think I'm a dick,

347
00:16:38,285 --> 00:16:39,445
and neither do I.

348
00:16:40,325 --> 00:16:42,485
Come on, people! The jig is up!

349
00:16:45,045 --> 00:16:46,565
Doesn't have to be.

350
00:16:51,005 --> 00:16:52,565
What's become of us?

351
00:16:56,005 --> 00:16:58,125
What has become of us?

352
00:16:58,205 --> 00:17:00,805
-Keep an eye on that kitchen window, you.
-I want no part of this.

353
00:17:00,885 --> 00:17:02,725
Well, you're in too deep now, Clare.

354
00:17:02,805 --> 00:17:04,325
You're stealing a body!

355
00:17:04,405 --> 00:17:07,005
Let's just get it over with,
and never, ever speak of it again.

356
00:17:07,085 --> 00:17:10,525
-Jesus, my nails are fucking ruined.
-[Erin] Less talking, more digging.

357
00:17:10,605 --> 00:17:12,485
[Orla] I've got something.

358
00:17:15,965 --> 00:17:16,965
[Erin] Give it here.

359
00:17:18,765 --> 00:17:21,045
Right. Me and Michelle
go stash him somewhere,

360
00:17:21,125 --> 00:17:23,445
and the rest of you all fill it back in.

361
00:17:23,525 --> 00:17:25,085
-Open the box, Erin.
-Oh, God!

362
00:17:25,165 --> 00:17:27,005
Yes, he is with us.
Do not be afraid, child.

363
00:17:32,005 --> 00:17:33,485

364
00:17:34,685 --> 00:17:36,845
Listen, I can...

365
00:17:39,005 --> 00:17:40,605
Oh, no, actually, I can't.

366
00:17:42,045 --> 00:17:43,485
I can't explain.

367
00:17:44,845 --> 00:17:47,165
Thanks be to God.

368
00:17:48,285 --> 00:17:49,805
Thanks be to God.

369
00:17:56,125 --> 00:17:57,685
I don't understand it.

370
00:17:58,365 --> 00:18:00,285
The Lord's work is often
difficult to comprehend.

371
00:18:00,365 --> 00:18:02,845
No, I mean I really,
really don't understand it.

372
00:18:02,925 --> 00:18:04,325
You're right, Father.

373
00:18:05,405 --> 00:18:06,805
He has... risen.

374
00:18:09,685 --> 00:18:11,845
It's truly a miracle.

375
00:18:11,925 --> 00:18:15,645
-So, what happens now, Peter?
-Well, I think the next stage is Rome.

376
00:18:17,045 --> 00:18:19,485
-Audience with the big man.
-Pavarotti?

377
00:18:19,565 --> 00:18:20,925
John Paul II.

378
00:18:22,325 --> 00:18:24,885
But first let us pray.
Please, join hands.

379
00:18:25,645 --> 00:18:26,725
I don't want you to touch me.

380
00:18:29,245 --> 00:18:30,565
Excuse me.

381
00:18:32,005 --> 00:18:34,845
It is vital you keep
a low profile for a bit.

382
00:18:34,925 --> 00:18:37,005
Do you hear me, Malarkey?

383
00:18:39,365 --> 00:18:40,805
That was nobody.

384
00:18:41,605 --> 00:18:43,725
Well, you could at least
wait till I've asked.

385
00:18:43,805 --> 00:18:46,445
Give my head peace, Erin.
Get back inside.

386
00:18:47,325 --> 00:18:50,205
Why are you calling Maureen Malarkey?

387
00:18:50,285 --> 00:18:52,445
Granda says we're not allowed
to speak to her.

388
00:18:52,525 --> 00:18:54,565
Oh, that? That's all blown over now.

389
00:18:56,685 --> 00:18:58,165

deceitful, cheating old witch!

391

-Why were you ringing her, Mammy?
-It's none of your business.

392
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:09,085
Fine. I'll ask her myself.

393

You gave Toto to Maureen Malarkey?

401
00:19:30,165 --> 00:19:32,245
Wee Tigger had just passed.

402
00:19:32,325 --> 00:19:33,565
She was lonely.

403
00:19:34,765 --> 00:19:37,285
The chapel. She was there.

404
00:19:37,365 --> 00:19:39,165
That dog was Toto.

405
00:19:39,245 --> 00:19:41,885
Oh, it's all adding up now,
isn't it, Mammy?

406
00:19:41,965 --> 00:19:44,925
-It's all for the best, Erin.
-You staged his death, Ma.

407
00:19:45,005 --> 00:19:47,085
I thought I'd lost him.
-Well, you have lost him.

408
00:19:47,165 --> 00:19:48,765
-We're not taking him back.
-What?

409
00:19:48,845 --> 00:19:50,245
Ah, come on. He's a shit dog.

410
00:19:50,325 --> 00:19:52,325
Toto was not a shit dog.

411
00:19:52,405 --> 00:19:55,405
-Well, he was no Gypsy.
-Stop it. I'm sick of it.

412
00:19:55,485 --> 00:19:57,325
You can't compare
every animal you have

413
00:19:57,405 --> 00:19:59,605

when you were five years old.

Well, I'm going to need some time
to think about that.

God, this is really hard.

425
00:20:55,965 --> 00:20:58,805
-Oh, it's been incredible.
-Were they always this hard?

426
00:20:58,885 --> 00:21:00,765
You know, to tell you the truth, Erin,

427
00:21:00,845 --> 00:21:03,205
I've been having a bit
of a crisis of faith recently.

428
00:21:03,285 --> 00:21:04,445
Is that so?

429
00:21:05,165 --> 00:21:06,685
Seriously, it's like a jawbreaker.

430
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:09,285
-It's been very challenging.
-Really?

431
00:21:10,765 --> 00:21:12,405
Sorry, I'm going to have to spit this out.

432
00:21:12,485 --> 00:21:15,725
And you know, it became
more challenging...

433
00:21:17,485 --> 00:21:19,925
when I met this amazing girl.

434
00:21:21,965 --> 00:21:23,605
-There was just this...
-Connection?

435
00:21:23,685 --> 00:21:25,205
Exactly.

436
00:21:25,565 --> 00:21:29,285
You know, made me question everything,
doubt everything.

437
00:21:29,365 --> 00:21:33,445
If God hadn't sent me this sign, I might
have left the priesthood to be with her.

438
00:21:33,525 --> 00:21:34,925
What if he didn't?

439
00:21:35,325 --> 00:21:36,525
I'm sorry?

440
00:21:36,605 --> 00:21:39,365
Send you the sign, I mean.
Just for argument's sake.

441
00:21:39,445 --> 00:21:41,005
Well, he did, Erin.

442
00:21:41,085 --> 00:21:43,125
You know, I could never abandon him now.

443
00:21:43,205 --> 00:21:44,805
-It's not true.
-What?

444
00:21:44,885 --> 00:21:47,085
We're lying. We've been lying.

445
00:21:47,165 --> 00:21:49,285
There was no smirking, no weeping.

446
00:21:49,365 --> 00:21:52,565
The dog's not even dead.
He's living with Maureen Malarkey.

447
00:21:52,645 --> 00:21:55,765
None of it's true, Peter.
It's all balls.

448
00:21:55,845 --> 00:21:59,965
But the good news is you're free.
We're free.

Peter, wait.

I've got the most amazing news.
I've had a calling.

Not all because of us, Orla.

I mean, a bit because of us.

462
00:22:41,445 --> 00:22:45,005
