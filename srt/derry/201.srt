-Jesus Christ.

Do the Protestants
have to bring waterproof trousers,

19
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:16,280
or will the Catholics be expected
to do all the dirty work?

20
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:18,840
It's not dirty work.
It's an outdoor pursuits weekend.

you were building bridges.

22
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,680
Not real bridges, Mammy.
Metaphorical bridges.

23
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:26,320
Then why can't you wear
metaphorical trousers?

-My crowd?

No, I think you can get them,

27
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,600

That time we went camping in Portsalon,

34
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:51,360
sure she was like Mowgli,
running around them woods.

35

She was that happy, Mary,

36
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,880

It's because his natural voice
is actually very seductive.

Apparently, he sounds like
a West Belfast Bond.

As far as English are concerned,

But why?
There's nothing wrong with that bowl.

Sure, I was admiring that bowl
only yesterday.

No funny business

We're not doing this to get off
with Protestant boys, Mammy.

No, I'm not.

103
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,360
I just don't think there's anything wrong

-Fiddling.
-...relations.

105
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:40,840
So, we need to head southeast
for 0.5 miles,

and you'll receive further instructions
shortly.

Look, the riding of the Protestants
is one thing,

119
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:11,080
but I don't see why
we have to buy them a present.

120

all the jobs and all the fucking rights.

My next Protestant gift delivery
isn't due to arrive until Wednesday,

I'm completely out of stock,

such a high fucking demand

How much for the Subbuteo, Dennis?

130
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:36,400
We'll call it 16 quid.

131
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,400
Could we call it 1.76?

132
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,680
No, we fucking couldn't.

133
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:41,640
How about we give you the 1.76,

134
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:44,040
-and we pay the rest off in installments?
-Yeah.

135
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,520
Which would be, what,
3.56 over four weeks.

136
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,320
Jesus, check out Rain Wain.

137
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:51,640
Or, you could give us the Subbuteo,
and then we could work off the debt.

138
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,320
Yeah, we could do chores and stuff.

139
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,000

Well, it's all right for you, Clare,
but we want to bunk these lads.

145
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,840
We have to offer them
some kind of incentive.

146
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:11,480
They're not prostitutes, Michelle,
and even if they were,

147
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:14,200
I think a half-eaten packet of Rolos
and an Ulster Bank keyring

148
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:15,920
is a pretty insulting form of payment.

149

Hi, guys.

152
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:23,960
That's... that's not what you're giving
to the Protestants, is it?

153
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,320
It's just a little token, really.

154
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,120
Yeah, so is ours.

155
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,400
Is that an Ulster Bank keyring?

156
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,840
It is indeed, yeah.

157
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,960
I must admit, I had a bit of an advantage

158
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:34,600
when it came to the whole
present buying thing, because--

159
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:37,080
-You're loaded.
-Because I know what they like.

-What?
-They don't come in halves, Jenny.

162

They do, actually.
I met her at ballet class.

Good for Zara. Bye-bye, now.

165
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:53,240
Of course she's friends with
a half-Protestant. Of course she is.

343
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,560
I really like this one.
Have you seen the video--

344
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:43,120
OK, let's cut the crap, Dee.

345
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:45,000
-Sorry?
-You know why I'm here.

346
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:46,680
-But before we begin--
-Begin what?

347
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:49,360
I won't have as many moves as you.
I just want to get that out there.

348
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,400
I really don't know--

349
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:53,960
I haven't put the hours in,
and that's not because I'm lazy,

350
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:55,760
it's just not part of our culture.

351
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:58,280
But if you're OK with that,
I'd say we just crack on.

352
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:01,080
[crunches]

353
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,480
Fancy another beer, mate?

354
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:05,440
Christ, I just love beer.

355
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:07,200
Don't you just love beer?

356
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:08,920
-Yeah, beer's nice.
-I love beer

357
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,720
and football and poker,
and, you know, tits.

358
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,360
-Tits?
-Can't get enough of them.

359
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,720
Then again, I am a lad.

360
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:15,880
Yeah, he may be a lad, Jon,

361
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:18,240
but I can offer you protection.

362
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,040
I have a hunting knife.

363
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:21,320
Right, OK.

364
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,720
Oy-oy, where you going?

365
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:25,520
-[Jon] Nature's calling.
-Whoa. Number one or number two?

366
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,680
-Excuse me?
-Just answer the question, Jon.

367
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,040
I don't want to answer the question.
I'm not comfortable with the question.

368
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:32,200
'Cause if it's a number two,
it's safer to bury it.

369
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:35,600
You don't want a pack of wolves
following your scent out in these parts.

370
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:38,080
Those boys,
they'll tear you limb from limb.

371
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:41,040
-We're inside.
-Very sophisticated noses, Jon.

372
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,440
I'm going to go now.

373
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:45,720
Can't you let me have anything for myself?

374
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:46,880
No.

375
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:51,800
[chuckles, clears throat]

376
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:56,000
Do you want to go somewhere
a bit more private?

377
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,280
[chuckles]

378
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:00,200
I'm not sure that's a good idea.

379
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,200
Why not?

380
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:07,040
What the fuck's that?

381
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:09,080
And, I think the reason I was interested

382
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:11,320
in whether you were
a fully blown Protestant

383
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:14,520
is because, as far as I'm concerned,
you can't be Protestant enough.

384
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:17,680
I am all for the Protestants.
I can't get enough of them.

385
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:20,280
Protestant mad, I am,
and I think--

386
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:23,120
and I may be running with this--
but I'm sure you really like Catholics.

387
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,880
It's just that we have been
conditioned to--

388
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:28,120
-I don't.
-What? You don't?

389
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:31,400
No. I hate them.
I think they're all arseholes.

390
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:34,360
That's not true. That can't be true.

391
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:38,560
It is. They're all thick as shit.
I despise them. I really do.

392
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:40,520
OK.

393
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:44,000
So, how do you want to do this?

394
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:48,200
Do you want to kick things off,
or should I?

395
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:51,040
Oh, my God, are you coming on to me?!

396
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,920
Is that what this is?

397
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,800
I thought you were having
some sort of breakdown.

398
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,680
[running footsteps]

399
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:01,040
He's wearing a purity bracelet.

400
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,200
What does that mean?

401
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:05,120
No down below action,
that's what it fucking means.

402
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,640
-We have to swap.
-Swap?

403
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:09,440
Yeah, we'll just swap over.
You take Harry, I'll take Lee.

404
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:10,960
-Dee.
-Whatever.

405
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:12,599
-We can't do that.
-Why not?

406
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:16,040
You fancied him first,
and your lack of moves won't be an issue.

407
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:17,800
-That is true.
-Aye.

408
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:19,440
-She's coming.
-Who?

409
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:21,280
The woman.
The small, angry penguin woman.

410
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:23,040
-Sister Michael!
-Shit!

411
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:25,240
-[bottles clinking]
-[panicked groans]

412
00:17:28,599 --> 00:17:29,920
Oh, good evening, Sister.

413
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,920
We just popped 'round
because we had a few questions

414
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,240
about the British Empire,

415
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,680
which the boys have cleared up
for us now, so--

416
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:38,760
They weren't talking about
the British Empire, Sister.

417
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:41,200
They were having a party.
I could hear the music.

418
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,840
You will go far in life, Jenny.

419
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:46,600
But you will not be well liked.

420
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:48,240
Honestly, girls.

421
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:50,280
I need my eight hours,

422
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:53,520
but I've had Mary Quinn on the phone
frying my head and now this.

423
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:54,840
What?

424
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:56,920
My mother rang? Why, is everything OK?

425
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,280
Oh, she was very distressed.
She wanted me to pass on a message.

426
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:03,200
And are you gonna?

427
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:05,560
Oh, fine.

428
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:07,640
Um... [clears throat]

429
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:10,880
"Erin, I need some information.

430
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:14,080
Can you find out, in a subtle way,

431
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:18,000
if Michelle's mother
was given the big bowl

432
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:20,560
by someone
she has since fallen out with,

433
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:24,880
and if she can no longer bring herself
to look at the big bowl

434
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,760
because it's just too painful?

435
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:28,480
All the best, your mother, Mary."

436
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:31,480
Well?

437
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:33,000
No.

438
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:35,080
Shift it. Let's go.

439
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:37,400
Come on. Quick.

00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:54,440
What's wrong with Clare?

444
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:56,280
She hasn't said two words
since last night.

445
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:57,360
Well, I'm not complaining.

446
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:02,120
I just did it for a laugh, the trousers.

447
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:05,640
I'll do anything for a laugh, me.
I'm mad like that.

448
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:06,800
Right.

449
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:08,440
Right, there they are.

450
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:10,240
OK, if we're going to do this, Michelle,

451
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,320
-we need to do it delicately.
-Course.

452
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,720
Oy, lads!

453
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:15,360
We wanna swap.

454
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:16,480
Brilliant.

455
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:18,000
-Swap?
-[Michelle] Yeah.

456
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:21,240
Erin's gonna have Harry now,
and I'm gonna have you, all right?

457
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,760
Great stuff.

458
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:26,040
I think we can all agree
that for generations

459
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:30,400
there's been a deep lack of trust
between your communities,

460
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:32,080
and that's where abseiling comes in.

461
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,200
[mutters] Christ.

462
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:35,960
Abseiling is a great
trust-building exercise,

463
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:38,880
because what you're doing is,
you're saying to your buddy,

464
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:41,960
"Lean on me, I'm here for you."

465
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:43,360
Now, let me see who's first.

466
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,840
Ah, Clare. Clare Devlin. There you are.

467
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:47,440
I-I'm not sure about this.

468
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,080
You'll be grand.

469
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:51,880
[quivering]
No, listen, you don't understand.

470
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,160
Now, where's your buddy?

471
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,680
Good man, yourself. Come on up.

472
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:01,200
[hawk screeching]

473
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:06,680
[Father Peter]
Philip will control Clare's descent

474
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:10,040
by feeding her rope through
what's known as a belay device.

475
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:15,600
So he'll be the one
actually dictating the speed of her drop.

476
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:17,720
I think if it's OK
I'd just like to take a moment and just--

477
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:18,960
Jesus!

478
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:20,240

479
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:22,480

-Oh, yeah.

-[whimpers]
-OK, everybody. So, on three...

00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:27,720

entirely comfortable with this.

He wants to kill us all,
all of the Catholics!

00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:41,680
Look at his eyes, he's a madman,

490
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:43,920

please!

00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,560

494
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:50,920
Fuck-a-doodle-doo.

495
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,080
-[Clare] He said he hated us.
-No, I didn't.

496
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:56,120
Last night you said you hated Catholics.
Admit it.

497
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:58,640
I said, I hated athletes.

498
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,640
Not much of a sports fan.

499
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,760
But we weren't even
talking about athletes.

500
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:04,360
Yeah, well, I thought we were.

501
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:07,120
Why would you have thought
we were talking about athletes?

502
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:09,360
Because I'm deaf in one ear.

503
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:14,080
"Catholics" sounds a bit like "athletes,"
to be fair to him, like.

504
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:17,640
[crowd]
Catholics... athletes...

505
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:19,440
They're all arseholes.

506
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,720
What the hell is that supposed to mean?

507
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,600
You tried to swap us.

508
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:26,800
Because all Protestants are the same,
aren't they, girls?

509
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:27,880
-Yes.
-No.

510
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:30,480
And this guy is really creepy
and a bit, sort of, sexist.

511
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:33,440
And she carries a knife and makes people
bury their own excrement.

512
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:35,040
[boy]
Fucking Catholics.

513
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,600
-Who said that?
-Who?

514
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:38,200
[crowd yelling]

515
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,480
Shall we break it up?

516
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:46,600
Don't touch the hair!
Don't touch the hair!

517
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,840
Let's leave it a minute.

518
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:53,440
[Mary]
I just cannot get me head around it.

519
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,240
[Gerry]
For the love of God, Mary,

520
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:56,480
it's only a bowl.

521
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:58,600
Who just gives away their big bowl, Gerry?

522
00:21:58,680 --> 00:21:59,760
It doesn't make sense.

523
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:01,280
Ah, she's definitely
up to something, love.

524
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:04,280
I have always said
that Deirdre Mallon is a bit fly.

525
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:06,600
-I'd confront her about it.
-Oh, I intend to.

526
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:10,120
Great, do that, then maybe we can
lay the whole bloody thing to rest.

527
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:13,680
Take that tone with her again
and I'll lay you to rest, boyo.

528
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,760
<i>[rock music playing]</i>

529
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:24,920
Do you know what this is about, Geraldine?

530
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,240
As far as I can make out,

531
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:29,600
these lads tried to throw my Clare
off a cliff.

532
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:30,800
Desperate.

533
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:34,120
You all right, Mary?
How's the bowl working out for you?

534
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:38,000
Great. Great. Thanks very much, Deirdre.

535
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:41,680
Well, that got to the bottom of it,
all right.

536
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:45,800
[Father Peter]
Is that everyone?

537
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:47,120
Lovely stuff.

538
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:51,440
OK, so there was
a bit of a misunderstanding

539
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:52,960
on the expedition today,

540
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:56,600
which unfortunately led
to a physical altercation.

541
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:00,160
I thought, rather than let it fester,

542
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:01,520
we should talk about it,

543
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,240
and start to heal

544
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:04,760
and repair.

545
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:08,280
So...

546
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:10,040
who'd like to go first?

547
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:11,920
"Jaffa bastard"?
You actually said those words?

548
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,160
It just came out, Mammy.

549
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:15,680
But why were you threatening people
with a knife, love?

550
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,440
OK, one at a time, please.

551
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:20,360
Well, if you'd wear the bloody hearing aid
I paid a fortune for,

552
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:22,000
-you'd have heard what she said!
-It's unbelievable.

553
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:24,480
Girls. You were fighting with girls?

554
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:26,880
This is all your fault, Gerry.
I knew this would happen.

555
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:28,960
See that child over there?
That child...
