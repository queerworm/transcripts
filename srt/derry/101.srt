I mean, what next?
Will I catch her trying on my knickers?

18
00:01:18,685 --> 00:01:20,925
Don't say "knickers" in front
of your father. He can't cope.

[Erin] Aye, he can cope.

I told you about my Auntie Kathy.

00:07:21,325 --> 00:07:23,925
She went to England years ago
to have an abortion, never came back.

161

Never got the abortion, either.
Lucky for you, James, eh? Ha!

162
00:07:28,765 --> 00:07:30,205
I didn't actually know that.

-Nothing interesting.

Kathy's just got divorced,
so she's moved back.

doing the dirt on him.

If anyone deserves to get punished,
it should be Michelle.

336
00:15:30,085 --> 00:15:31,605
Well, I think it's safe to say

337
00:15:31,685 --> 00:15:33,965
we all just lost a bit of respect
for you there, Clare.

338
00:15:35,365 --> 00:15:38,085
This is just so disappointing, girls.
I mean, threatening a first-year...

339
00:15:38,165 --> 00:15:41,005
We didn't threaten her.
We're not stupid. Big Mandy is her sister,

340
00:15:41,085 --> 00:15:43,245
-she's half fucking gorilla.
-That's enough, Miss Mallon.

341
00:15:43,325 --> 00:15:46,205
Aye. You shouldn't swear, Michelle,
because when you swear,

342
00:15:46,285 --> 00:15:50,205
Our Lady in heaven,
she cries her tears and then make rain.

343
00:15:50,285 --> 00:15:51,845
Isn't that right, Sister Michael?

344
00:15:52,925 --> 00:15:55,125
-What age are you now, Orla?
-Fifteen.

345
00:15:55,805 --> 00:15:58,205
Yeah. You might want
to think about wising up.

346
00:15:59,005 --> 00:16:01,245
It was all just a misunderstanding.

347
00:16:01,325 --> 00:16:02,525
I promise, Sister.

348
00:16:03,405 --> 00:16:05,845
Is that right, Tina?
Was it a misunderstanding?

349
00:16:05,925 --> 00:16:07,325
Look, I didn't even report them.

350
00:16:07,405 --> 00:16:09,365
I'm not a grass.
I'm saying nothing.

351
00:16:09,445 --> 00:16:11,365
Is that because
you're intimidated by them?

352
00:16:11,445 --> 00:16:12,965
[scoffs]

353
00:16:13,045 --> 00:16:14,485
Oh, you were serious.

354
00:16:14,565 --> 00:16:17,325
No, I'm not intimidated by them, Sister.

355
00:16:17,885 --> 00:16:18,885
Okay.

356
00:16:20,045 --> 00:16:22,645
Well, I see no need
to take this matter any further,

357
00:16:22,725 --> 00:16:25,965
but if I ever get wind of something
like this happening again...

358
00:16:26,045 --> 00:16:27,605
Oh, you won't, Sister.

359
00:16:28,165 --> 00:16:30,645
-Yeah?
-Sister Michael, can I just quickly ask,

360
00:16:30,725 --> 00:16:34,925
um, since there's no male student toilets
on the premises,

361
00:16:35,565 --> 00:16:37,405
am I permitted to use the staff ones?

362
00:16:37,485 --> 00:16:40,845
Absolutely not. Now, I think you all
owe Tina an apology, don't you?

363
00:16:41,525 --> 00:16:45,125
[all] We're very sorry, Tina.

364
00:16:45,205 --> 00:16:48,005
-And Tina, do you accept their apology?
-[Tina] No.

365
00:16:48,965 --> 00:16:50,845
You don't accept their apology?

366
00:16:50,925 --> 00:16:53,525
Do I have to accept their apology, Sister?

367
00:16:54,165 --> 00:16:56,885
-I don't suppose you do, no.
-Then I don't.

368
00:16:57,925 --> 00:16:59,645
I don't accept it.

369
00:17:01,245 --> 00:17:02,245
I see.

370
00:17:02,725 --> 00:17:06,085
Well, I need to draw a line
under this somehow, so...

371
00:17:14,365 --> 00:17:16,405
[ticking]

372
00:17:19,245 --> 00:17:23,325
I cannot actually believe this.

373
00:17:23,405 --> 00:17:25,565
I'm missing David Donnelly's gig,
Michelle.

374
00:17:25,645 --> 00:17:27,845
And all because of
that miniature motherfucker.

375
00:17:27,925 --> 00:17:30,445
I swear, if you say
"motherfucker" one more time...

376
00:17:30,525 --> 00:17:32,805
-What's wrong with you?
-This is your fault.

377
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:33,845
Why is it my fault?

378
00:17:33,925 --> 00:17:35,765
You're the one who threatened
a first-year.

379
00:17:35,845 --> 00:17:38,125
You're the one who
gave Jenny Joyce the finger.

380
00:17:38,205 --> 00:17:40,725
I'm desperate now.
This is agony.

381
00:17:41,605 --> 00:17:45,045
Can you please stop crying in my face
for five fucking minutes, James?

382
00:17:45,125 --> 00:17:46,325
[Clare] I feel awful.

383
00:17:47,285 --> 00:17:50,925
My body is going into starvation mode.
I think it's starting to shut down.

384
00:17:51,005 --> 00:17:53,445
For Christ's sake, Clare.
You've basically skipped lunch.

385
00:17:56,205 --> 00:17:59,805
Orla, that better not be
what I think it is.

386
00:17:59,885 --> 00:18:02,405
You better not have brought
my diary to school.

387
00:18:02,485 --> 00:18:05,605
I had to.
I'm doing my book report on it.

388
00:18:06,365 --> 00:18:07,885
-Give it... to me!
-No!

389
00:18:07,965 --> 00:18:09,725
What's going on there, girls?

390
00:18:09,805 --> 00:18:12,165
She has my diary, Sister,
and she won't give it back.

391
00:18:12,245 --> 00:18:13,445
I'll take that.

392
00:18:17,645 --> 00:18:20,485
Sit down. Mr. Maguire,

393
00:18:21,005 --> 00:18:22,405
you have been warned.

394
00:18:22,925 --> 00:18:24,365
Do not ask me again.

395
00:18:24,445 --> 00:18:26,085
This is disgraceful.

396
00:18:26,165 --> 00:18:29,325
I should have access to a lavatory.
What about my civil rights?

397
00:18:29,405 --> 00:18:30,485
Corner.

398
00:18:34,245 --> 00:18:36,525
And you. Give that here.

399
00:18:36,605 --> 00:18:38,205
-Ach, Sister--
-Now.

400
00:18:43,325 --> 00:18:45,245
Shouldn't you put that
in the confiscated box?

401
00:18:45,325 --> 00:18:46,565
Quiet.

402
00:18:49,045 --> 00:18:51,485
-Really?
-[Michelle] What am I gonna do, Erin?

403
00:18:51,565 --> 00:18:53,685
That color's been discontinued.

404
00:18:57,885 --> 00:18:59,365
This is torture.

405
00:18:59,445 --> 00:19:02,565
Michelle, I can't hold it in any longer.

406
00:19:02,645 --> 00:19:05,805
What part of me not giving a flying fuck
are you struggling with, exactly?

407
00:19:08,845 --> 00:19:11,925
Oh, look, your boring fucking diary
sent her to sleep.

408
00:19:12,525 --> 00:19:13,885
I'm taking my lipstick back.

409
00:19:14,525 --> 00:19:16,365
Michelle, you can't do that.
It's stealing.

410
00:19:16,445 --> 00:19:17,645
She stole it first.

411
00:19:17,725 --> 00:19:19,485
Michelle, don't.

412
00:19:19,565 --> 00:19:21,045
Oh, God.

413
00:19:25,045 --> 00:19:27,005
Jesus, that's disgusting.
Stop it.

414
00:19:27,085 --> 00:19:29,565
That's English for you.
Fucking savages.

415
00:19:32,005 --> 00:19:35,285
Don't look at me like that, Erin.
You'll get your two pound back.

416
00:19:36,405 --> 00:19:38,525
But will you ever get
your self-respect back, Clare?

417
00:19:38,605 --> 00:19:41,045
Right, if I leave now,
I might still catch David.

418
00:19:41,125 --> 00:19:43,445
What if Sister Declan wakes up?

419
00:19:43,525 --> 00:19:45,925
It's funny how she sleeps
with her eyes wide open,

420
00:19:46,005 --> 00:19:47,685
-isn't it?
-What?

421
00:19:53,765 --> 00:19:55,445
Sweet suffering Jehovah.

422
00:19:56,045 --> 00:19:57,565
[James groans]

423
00:19:57,645 --> 00:19:59,205
[urinating]

424
00:20:00,765 --> 00:20:04,645
[clock chiming]

425
00:20:07,205 --> 00:20:09,485
-[knock on door]
-[Sister Michael] Enter.

426
00:20:11,445 --> 00:20:13,165
Erin, what in God's name...

427
00:20:13,885 --> 00:20:15,365
Did you kill that wee nun, girls?

428
00:20:15,445 --> 00:20:16,525
[Erin] Of course we didn't.

429
00:20:16,605 --> 00:20:20,085
Then why were you pissing on her dead body
and making sandwiches?

430
00:20:20,165 --> 00:20:23,165
Say nothing, girls.
Say nothing till we've seen a lawyer.

431
00:20:23,245 --> 00:20:24,285
If you could take a seat.

432
00:20:29,725 --> 00:20:33,205
Sorry I'm late, Sister, couldn't
get over the bridge. This bloody bomb.

433
00:20:33,285 --> 00:20:35,205
I begged the Brits
to let me take my chances,

434
00:20:35,285 --> 00:20:37,565
but the awkward bastards
made me go the long way.

435
00:20:37,645 --> 00:20:39,605
Health and Safety gone mad, Deidre.

436
00:20:39,845 --> 00:20:42,485
What are you playing at,
rifling through a dead nun's handbag?

437
00:20:42,565 --> 00:20:44,765
-She stole my lipstick, Mammy.
-[Deidre] Don't lie.

438
00:20:44,845 --> 00:20:47,085
Sister Declan was a woman of God.

439
00:20:47,165 --> 00:20:49,245
Actually, she was known
to be a bit light-fingered.

440
00:20:50,005 --> 00:20:51,685
Where's my mom, Auntie Deidre?

441
00:20:51,765 --> 00:20:53,525
She's away back to London.

442
00:20:53,605 --> 00:20:54,845
What, without me?

443
00:20:54,925 --> 00:20:57,805
-Oh, dry your eyes, James.
-[door opens]

444
00:20:57,885 --> 00:20:59,245
Sorry to keep you waiting, Sister.

445
00:20:59,325 --> 00:21:01,885
How long does it take
to defuse a fecking bomb?

446
00:21:01,965 --> 00:21:03,405
Sure, the wee robots do all the work.

447
00:21:05,045 --> 00:21:07,325
-Oh, killing nuns now, is it?
-I didn't, Daddy!

448
00:21:07,405 --> 00:21:09,925
You wait until your mother
hears about this.

449
00:21:10,005 --> 00:21:13,445
Obviously, Sister Declan's death was
extremely shocking and unexpected.

450
00:21:14,205 --> 00:21:16,485
We're still struggling
to understand what happened.

451
00:21:17,365 --> 00:21:18,885
-Yeah?
-[Erin] Can I just ask,

452
00:21:18,965 --> 00:21:21,445
what age was Sister Declan?

453
00:21:21,525 --> 00:21:23,365
She'd have been 98 on Friday.

454
00:21:23,445 --> 00:21:24,605
[Erin] Right.

455
00:21:24,685 --> 00:21:27,725
Might that shed some light
on the situation?

456
00:21:27,805 --> 00:21:29,165
How so?

457
00:21:30,245 --> 00:21:32,445
Does anybody else have any thoughts
on the whole

458
00:21:32,525 --> 00:21:35,645
"her being almost 98 years of age" thing?

459
00:21:35,725 --> 00:21:37,685
Struck down in her prime.

460
00:21:37,765 --> 00:21:40,965
The hospital are saying
it was heart failure,

461
00:21:41,045 --> 00:21:43,525
but I have my doubts.

462
00:21:43,605 --> 00:21:45,005
As I said on the phone,

463
00:21:45,085 --> 00:21:50,045
the circumstances in which I found her
body were... strange, to say the least.

464
00:21:50,125 --> 00:21:53,085
So I've decided to carry out a full
investigation into the incident.

465
00:21:53,965 --> 00:21:55,245
That makes sense.

466
00:21:56,165 --> 00:21:57,165
What?

467
00:21:57,725 --> 00:22:00,005
Nothing about this makes sense.

468
00:22:00,085 --> 00:22:03,645
The woman was almost 98 years of age.
She had a heart attack.

469
00:22:03,725 --> 00:22:06,085
Why has everybody gone absolutely mental?

470
00:22:06,165 --> 00:22:07,365
Less of the cheek, Erin.

471
00:22:07,765 --> 00:22:10,805
We didn't do anything.
It's not fair!

472
00:22:10,885 --> 00:22:13,685
[Orla] "But the thing is, life isn't fair.

473
00:22:13,765 --> 00:22:17,805
You see, injustice is something
I have become accustomed to.

474
00:22:17,885 --> 00:22:21,085
I am, after all,
a child of the crossfire,

475
00:22:21,165 --> 00:22:23,605
surrounded by conflict.

476
00:22:23,685 --> 00:22:25,805
But I choose to rise above it.

477
00:22:25,885 --> 00:22:31,405
"The path to peace is paved
with tolerance and understanding.

478
00:22:31,485 --> 00:22:35,045
Violence is never the answer."

479
00:22:36,205 --> 00:22:40,805
I am going to ram that
so far up your arse!
