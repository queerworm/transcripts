As you all know, at the beginning of term,

00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:23,000
the Bishop graciously bestowed
a beautiful piece of religious art

3
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:25,680
unto Our Lady Immaculate College:

00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,600
Sure isn't he a great fella
altogether?

8
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:43,640
I still don't get
what it's supposed to be.

9
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:45,800
It's Jesus as a wain.

Why has he got a big red hat on?

11
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:49,440
-Nobody knows.
-It was the Bishop's wish

12
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:52,040
that he be passed around
all the schools in the Derry diocese.

13
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:53,320
Therefore, we are joined this morning

by Mr. Malone,
headmaster of St. Benedict's,

15
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:58,160
so the handover ceremony can take place.

16
00:00:58,240 --> 00:00:59,800
You are very welcome, Mr. Malone...

17
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:02,440
though I fear
you may have had a wasted journey.

18
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:05,080
I've thought about it,

19
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:08,840
and I'd much rather
just hold onto him, actually.

20
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:11,160
He brightens up my office.

21
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:13,640
He doesn't answer back.

22
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:15,840
I like the fella.

23
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:19,280
And if the Bishop has a problem with that,
he can take it up with me.

24
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,160
Now, what else was there?

25
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:22,440
Hmm.

Ah, yes.

-You're not going to read it out, are you?
-Of course.

59
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:00,400
Poetry should always be read aloud.

well, they have a very basic grasp
of the creative process,

whereas I've been writing for years,

88

so, I'm really not afraid
to put myself out there,

in a political sense,

didn't he choke to death on one?

are absolutely crippling at the minute.

525
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:52,560
-[Mary] Tell me about it.
-It's desperate.

526
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,320
Part of the reason I became a nun.

527
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,840
Free accommodation.

528
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:57,400
[Erin]
But Ms. De Brún,

529
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:59,320
you inspired me
to do my greatest work.

530
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:01,680
I see. Which was...

531
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,400
My poem. My glass doll poem.
She's a doll made of glass.

532
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,680
She's a glass doll.
I read it to you last night.

533
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:08,360
Yeah, I wasn't really listening,
to be honest.

534
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:09,440
[gasps]

535
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:11,520
Cheers.

536
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:13,200
[door opens]

537
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:15,240
Carpe diem.

538
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,560
Carpe dickhead.
[laughs]

539
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,480
Well, I guess we never knew

540
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:22,520
who the real Ms. De Brún was.

541
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:23,680
Bit like Keyser Söze.

542
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,080
Fella with the bad leg.

543
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:26,280
What?

544
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:27,720
Keyser Söze.

545
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:29,680
He was the fella with the bad leg.

546
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:32,000
He was talking absolute shite
the whole time.

547
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:34,320
He was one of those--
Uh, what you call it?

548
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,360
Unreliable narrators.

549
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:39,760
Oh, that's very clever.

550
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:42,880
Yeah. I thought so too.

551
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:46,440
Look this way, girls.

552
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:48,680
