-[Mary] Really?
-Honest to God.

00:00:23,005 --> 00:00:26,365
So, if I was to go next door and open
that washing basket of yours...

5
00:00:26,445 --> 00:00:30,845
You wouldn't find any darks.

00:00:34,245 --> 00:00:37,005
Listen, I've plenty of coloreds.
You're welcome to my coloreds.

9
00:00:37,085 --> 00:00:39,285
I'm not interested
in your coloreds, Sarah.

10
00:00:39,365 --> 00:00:41,165
It's darks I need. Oh, listen, Da.

11
00:00:41,245 --> 00:00:43,405
Do not be starting at me
about darks, Mary.

12
00:00:43,485 --> 00:00:45,645
I've given you whatever darks I have.

13
00:00:45,725 --> 00:00:47,405
Stick on a half load
and be done with it, woman.

14
00:00:47,485 --> 00:00:50,565
A half load goes against everything
I stand for. You know that, Da.

You away to do the big shop, Da?

16

Aye. Gerry! Gerry!

I don't see why that useless drip
you call a husband has to be coming.

18

Because someone needs to drive
and you've been suspended, again.

-[Joe] Nothing!

It's RUC discrimination.

21
00:01:05,325 --> 00:01:07,325
The only crime I committed
was to be born a Catholic.

22
00:01:07,405 --> 00:01:09,405
Gerry's never been suspended
and he's a Catholic.

23
00:01:09,485 --> 00:01:11,085
He's also a prick, but that's by the by.

It's unlikely she'll be returning
to school before the end of the year,

00:05:55,245 --> 00:05:56,925

we can do now is--

-Pray for her?
-No. What use would that do?

No, I think the best thing we can do

133
00:06:00,805 --> 00:06:03,285
is decide who will fulfill
the role of editor now.

134
00:06:04,365 --> 00:06:08,165
Sister Michael, some of us have actually
already discussed this eventuality,

135
00:06:08,725 --> 00:06:11,085
and the thing is, well,
nobody's comfortable

137
00:06:12,445 --> 00:06:15,045
It feels a bit, sort of, disrespectful.

138
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:17,725
We think this issue should be canceled.

139
00:06:17,805 --> 00:06:20,445

if nobody is willing to take her place--

-Absolutely.
-[Jenny] No, you can't.

-Well, not yet.

151
00:06:50,205 --> 00:06:51,645

You've never written an article, Erin.

153

past Rupert Murdoch over there.

169

Aye, you were far too thin, Sarah.

174
00:07:42,805 --> 00:07:44,405
No, it was. It was brilliant,

175

as a photograph to look back on.

176

Look, it's gone. The docket's gone.

177
00:07:50,405 --> 00:07:52,965
-Why don't we just move on?
-Why don't you just move out?

We need to make a call on our late story.

Okay. So, let's...

224
00:10:04,165 --> 00:10:05,445
Would you stop doing that, please?

225
00:10:05,525 --> 00:10:08,365
I can't let my heart rate drop,
I'm afraid, Erin.

226
00:10:08,445 --> 00:10:11,045
Let's just run through
some of our favorite ideas.

227
00:10:11,125 --> 00:10:13,365
So, firstly, animals.

228
00:10:13,445 --> 00:10:16,365
-Animals. Can someone elaborate?
-[Erin] Yeah.

229
00:10:16,445 --> 00:10:20,565
So, this concept would focus on animals,

230
00:10:20,645 --> 00:10:24,525
alongside pictures of famous people
who look a bit like animals.

231
00:10:24,605 --> 00:10:26,885
-Michelle Pfeiffer looks like a cat.
-Exactly.

232
00:10:26,965 --> 00:10:29,565
[James] Okay. Right. Animals.

233
00:10:29,645 --> 00:10:31,565
Uh, what's the next one? Shoes of the--

234
00:10:31,645 --> 00:10:33,725
-Shoes of the world.
-And that involves...?

235
00:10:33,805 --> 00:10:38,565
So, this piece would concentrate
on different shoes from around the world,

236
00:10:38,645 --> 00:10:44,165
sitting alongside pictures of, you know,
different shoes from around the world.

237
00:10:44,885 --> 00:10:45,845
Okay.

238
00:10:45,925 --> 00:10:47,925
So, like, how in Russia
they wear boots because--

239
00:10:48,005 --> 00:10:50,605
-It's Baltic.
-And in India they wear sandals because--

240
00:10:50,685 --> 00:10:52,045
It's boiling.

241
00:10:52,965 --> 00:10:54,565
So that's it, is it?

242
00:10:55,685 --> 00:10:57,005
Thoughts?

243
00:10:57,085 --> 00:11:00,405
I'm not totally convinced
by either of them, if I'm honest.

00:11:05,045 --> 00:11:06,845
Oh, my God. They're shit.

-Okay, don't panic.
-Don't panic?

248
00:11:17,765 --> 00:11:19,445
Don't panic, James?

249
00:11:19,525 --> 00:11:22,365
"Shoes of the world".

-[Erin] No. It's okay.

Exactly. There's bound to be
something in here we can steal.

00:11:34,765 --> 00:11:36,605
We can just steal something,

256
00:11:36,685 --> 00:11:38,605
and we'll-we'll just steal someone's idea

257

-Why not?

controversy?

Yes. Actually, yes, I am.

284
00:12:50,565 --> 00:12:53,645
I mean, for God's sake, Erin,
what happened to "Shoes of the World"?

285
00:12:53,725 --> 00:12:55,165
This is more important.

286
00:12:55,245 --> 00:12:57,965
This is about, you know, gay rights.

287
00:12:58,045 --> 00:13:01,645
I see. And I take it that's what
the camp shirts are in aid of.

288
00:13:01,725 --> 00:13:03,765
A very serious uniform violation,
by the way.

But let's take one problem at a time,
shall we?

00:13:06,005 --> 00:13:07,845
This isn't a problem, Sister.

291
00:13:07,925 --> 00:13:10,445
This is groundbreaking journalism.

They are not to be distributed tomorrow.
Do I make myself clear?

293
00:13:14,325 --> 00:13:15,885
But that's censorship.

294
00:13:16,645 --> 00:13:18,405
Well done. You are correct.

295
00:13:18,485 --> 00:13:20,245
You're being censored, now go.

296
00:13:28,005 --> 00:13:30,805
You see, I was so focused on
pissing off that gobshite

297
00:13:30,885 --> 00:13:33,685
my eldest girl's unfortunate enough
to be married to,

298
00:13:33,765 --> 00:13:35,965
that I completely lost sight of the fact

299
00:13:36,045 --> 00:13:38,445
that they were really her birthday photos.

300
00:13:38,525 --> 00:13:40,405
And my other girl, my younger girl,

301
00:13:40,485 --> 00:13:44,445
well, she was looking very slim
at the time, so go and grab them for me,

302
00:13:44,525 --> 00:13:46,125
there's a good fella.

303
00:13:46,205 --> 00:13:47,645
I can't accept that.

-The photographs.

308
00:14:01,845 --> 00:14:03,365
Well, I remember you.

309
00:14:03,445 --> 00:14:04,765
I couldn't forget you.

I don't mind, Ciaran.

313
00:14:14,565 --> 00:14:17,645
I don't mind at all.

314
00:14:19,365 --> 00:14:21,045
Oh, for Christ's sake.

315
00:14:21,765 --> 00:14:26,085
It's wrong.
I mean, my God, the injustice of it all.

You should get that one framed
as a wee reminder of your night, Mary.

317

I'm not in that one.

318
00:14:30,605 --> 00:14:32,845
No, but it's stunning of me.

319
00:14:32,925 --> 00:14:35,085
-It is indeed.
-[Joe] Hey, boy.

320
00:14:35,165 --> 00:14:37,445
It's dinner she invited you round for,
not an orgy.

321
00:14:37,525 --> 00:14:41,565
She basically told us we can't print
the story because it's about a lesbian.

322
00:14:41,645 --> 00:14:44,725
Do you not think there's an awful lot
of lesbians about nowadays?

323
00:14:44,805 --> 00:14:46,725
You can't move for lesbians.

324
00:14:46,805 --> 00:14:49,005
It's wall-to-wall lesbians out there.

325
00:14:49,085 --> 00:14:50,525
-Really?
-[Joe] It's true.

326
00:14:50,605 --> 00:14:52,405
Brigitte Gallagher, she's a lesbian.

327
00:14:52,485 --> 00:14:54,365
Brigitte Gallagher,
who works in the post office?

328
00:14:54,445 --> 00:14:57,285
-I believe so.
-Is she not a vegetarian, Da?

329
00:14:57,925 --> 00:15:00,125
Sorry, you're right.
Vegetarian, Brigitte is.

330
00:15:00,925 --> 00:15:03,485
Well, it's an easy mistake to make, Joe.

331
00:15:04,085 --> 00:15:05,285
Can I call you Joe?

332
00:15:05,365 --> 00:15:07,805
-No.
-Right.

333
00:15:08,765 --> 00:15:09,925
Welcome to the club, Ciaran.

334
00:15:10,005 --> 00:15:12,645
I'm gonna have to make a stand
about this, Mammy.

335
