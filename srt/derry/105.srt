1
00:00:16,005 --> 00:00:17,685
[drum roll]

2
00:00:22,405 --> 00:00:24,965
[banging]

3
00:00:28,045 --> 00:00:29,405
[man shouts indistinctly outside]

4
00:00:29,485 --> 00:00:32,765
[Ma Mary] Already?
They've started already?

5
00:00:32,845 --> 00:00:34,605
Think it's just a rehearsal, love.

6
00:00:34,685 --> 00:00:37,165
They've been playing
the same three songs since 1795.

7
00:00:37,245 --> 00:00:38,885
What do they need to rehearse for?

8
00:00:38,965 --> 00:00:41,685
Well, practice makes perfect, Aunt Mary.

9
00:00:41,765 --> 00:00:44,085
You know, that is why they are
so cracker.

10
00:00:44,165 --> 00:00:45,445
I'm sorry?

11
00:00:45,525 --> 00:00:47,445
Did you just call
the Orange Order "cracker"?

12
00:00:47,525 --> 00:00:49,085
I'm considering joining.

13
00:00:49,165 --> 00:00:51,405
I don't think they accept
Catholics, Orla,

14
00:00:51,485 --> 00:00:54,125
or, you know,
acknowledge our right to exist.

15
00:00:54,205 --> 00:00:57,485
Give us a hand here, Gerry.
This'll not close.

16
00:00:58,645 --> 00:01:00,125
We need to shift ourselves.

17
00:01:00,205 --> 00:01:02,285
-We're the last Fenians standing.
-Relax, love.

18
00:01:02,365 --> 00:01:05,085
We've a good two or three hours
before the rioting starts.

19
00:01:05,165 --> 00:01:07,765
I'll not settle myself
until we're over that border, Da.

20
00:01:09,005 --> 00:01:11,645
You're absolutely sure we need
the big clock, love?

21
00:01:11,725 --> 00:01:14,445
-We've been through this.
-Don't want to bring the wee clock?

22
00:01:14,525 --> 00:01:15,965
I can't be doing with the wee clock.

23
00:01:16,045 --> 00:01:17,885
What exactly is your problem
with the big clock?

24
00:01:17,965 --> 00:01:19,845
I wouldn't say I have a problem, as such.

25
00:01:19,925 --> 00:01:22,285
It's just much heavier
and takes up a lot of room.

26
00:01:22,365 --> 00:01:24,245
I'm telling you, Mary.
That's how it starts.

27
00:01:24,325 --> 00:01:26,685
Now he's dictating
what size of clock you can pack.

28
00:01:26,765 --> 00:01:28,725
Next he'll be telling you
what to wear, what to say.

29
00:01:28,805 --> 00:01:32,405
Before you know it, you'll be faking
your own death, assuming a new identity.

30
00:01:32,485 --> 00:01:35,965
Erin, I told you not to let him watch
that<i> Sleeping with the Enemy.</i>

31
00:01:36,045 --> 00:01:37,805
-[Erin] Couldn't stop him, Mammy.
-Great show.

32
00:01:37,885 --> 00:01:39,605
Stick that in the boot.

33
00:01:39,685 --> 00:01:41,325
[Gerry grunting]

34
00:01:41,405 --> 00:01:43,885
You'll be as well
getting one of the wains to do it.

35
00:01:44,605 --> 00:01:45,925
Out of the way.

36
00:01:47,845 --> 00:01:49,045
[groans]

37
00:01:52,645 --> 00:01:53,845
-[door opens]
-Right.

38
00:01:53,925 --> 00:01:56,765
Listen to it. I mean, just listen to it.

39
00:01:56,845 --> 00:01:59,445
They can't-- I mean, they don't--
Why do they have to be so loud?

40
00:01:59,525 --> 00:02:01,805
-Breathe, love.
-It's far worse for me, Clare.

41
00:02:01,885 --> 00:02:05,445
-I mean, my hearing is impeccable.
-I've read the same paragraph 47 times

42
00:02:05,525 --> 00:02:09,965
because I can't concentrate,
because-- Oh my God, the noise!

43
00:02:10,045 --> 00:02:12,165
This whale, he's a bad brute, Mrs. Quinn.

44
00:02:12,245 --> 00:02:14,245
I have to know if they catch him.

45
00:02:14,325 --> 00:02:15,885
Can I come away with you, please?

46
00:02:16,525 --> 00:02:19,725
Okay, well, if your mother has
no objections, I don't see why not.

47
00:02:19,805 --> 00:02:22,165
Thank you. Thank you.

48
00:02:22,245 --> 00:02:24,525
I'll never forget this. Thank you!

49
00:02:24,605 --> 00:02:28,325
She's taking you to a caravan in Portnoo.
She's not giving you a kidney, Clare.

50
00:02:28,405 --> 00:02:30,485
Listen, Mary. I just did a reading.

51
00:02:31,205 --> 00:02:35,685
The cards say if we go on this wee holiday
we're placing ourselves in grave danger,

52
00:02:35,765 --> 00:02:37,885
which I'm not buzzing about, to
be honest.

53
00:02:37,965 --> 00:02:39,565
You're not psychic, Aunt Sarah.

54
00:02:39,645 --> 00:02:41,005
I am psychic, Erin.

55
00:02:41,085 --> 00:02:43,725
I did a course. I got a certificate.

56
00:02:44,685 --> 00:02:47,085
Aye, this does not look good.

57
00:02:47,165 --> 00:02:48,885
Still no sign of the lottery numbers?

58
00:02:48,965 --> 00:02:50,365
[Sarah] No, Daddy.

59
00:02:50,445 --> 00:02:54,605
This psychic carry-on, it's not
all it's cracked up to be, you know.

60
00:02:54,685 --> 00:02:59,365
Last night,
I woke up to this wailing sound.

61
00:02:59,445 --> 00:03:02,005
I thought to myself,
"Jesus, it's Granny Pat.

62
00:03:02,085 --> 00:03:04,245
She's trying to cross over."

63
00:03:04,325 --> 00:03:06,445
Now, it turned out
it was only Aggie next door.

64
00:03:06,525 --> 00:03:09,365
She'd put the electric blanket
on full whack

65
00:03:09,445 --> 00:03:11,525
and scalded the legs of herself.

66
00:03:11,605 --> 00:03:14,885
But still, it could
just as easily have been--

67
00:03:14,965 --> 00:03:16,765
The disembodied spirit of a dead relative?

68
00:03:16,845 --> 00:03:19,285
Exactly. My nerves are wrecked.

69
00:03:19,365 --> 00:03:21,805
I'm living on a knife's edge here.

70
00:03:21,885 --> 00:03:24,765
-Is there any Rice Krispies?
-[Orla] Shh! Shh!

71
00:03:24,845 --> 00:03:27,205
This is the best bit.

72
00:03:28,085 --> 00:03:30,445
Okay, everyone. Remain calm.

73
00:03:30,525 --> 00:03:34,285
I need you all to listen very carefully.

74
00:03:34,365 --> 00:03:35,805
[marching band music]

75
00:03:37,925 --> 00:03:40,685
-[Mary] Okay, I'm going in.
-[door opens]

76
00:03:40,765 --> 00:03:42,965
-[knocking]
-For the love of God,

77
00:03:43,045 --> 00:03:44,205
don't come in here!

78
00:03:44,285 --> 00:03:46,165
-Everything all right, Mary?
-Stay back, Deidre.

79
00:03:46,245 --> 00:03:48,005
This place is a death trap.

80
00:03:48,085 --> 00:03:49,325
Mary, I hate to do this to you,

81
00:03:49,405 --> 00:03:50,965
but me and Martin are both
working nights,

82
00:03:51,045 --> 00:03:53,725
and I'm nervous about leaving these two,
what with the day that's on it.

83
00:03:53,805 --> 00:03:55,685
Don't suppose you could
take them with you?

84
00:03:55,765 --> 00:03:57,765
-Ach, away, Deidre, it's just--
-The English thing?

85
00:03:58,485 --> 00:04:00,125
[sighs] Listen, Mary, I understand.

86
00:04:00,205 --> 00:04:02,685
I mean, he's my nephew,
and even I find it hard to get past.

87
00:04:02,765 --> 00:04:05,965
If I'm totally honest, there's times
when I look at him and I feel...

88
00:04:06,045 --> 00:04:08,965
well, it's pure hatred.

89
00:04:09,045 --> 00:04:11,925
-I'll not dress it up.
-No, no, it's not the English thing.

90
00:04:12,005 --> 00:04:14,245
Hope to God it's not the gay thing
you're offended by.

91
00:04:14,325 --> 00:04:17,365
-There is no gay thing.
-Because I'd be disappointed in you, Mary,

92
00:04:17,445 --> 00:04:19,445
-I'll not lie.
-Of course not.

93
00:04:19,525 --> 00:04:22,605
I mean, if anything, the gay thing
sort of cancels out the English thing.

94
00:04:22,685 --> 00:04:24,765
Again, no gay thing.

95
00:04:24,845 --> 00:04:28,165
You wouldn't move over there, James?
I can't see past your massive closet.

96
00:04:28,245 --> 00:04:29,965
I'm just not sure
we'll have room in the caravan.

97
00:04:30,045 --> 00:04:33,005
It'll be grand. Us men can camp outside.

98
00:04:33,085 --> 00:04:34,685
-Oh, God.
-Oh, God.

99
00:04:34,765 --> 00:04:36,965
Run and ask Jim across the road
for the lend of his tent.

100
00:04:37,045 --> 00:04:39,045
Well, thanks a million, Mary.
I owe you one.

101
00:04:39,125 --> 00:04:42,365
If you want our Ryan to sort that gable
wall of yours out, you've only to ask.

102
00:04:44,125 --> 00:04:45,965
What's wrong with our gable wall?

103
00:04:46,885 --> 00:04:49,845
-[Mary] Christ's sake.
-[Sarah] Do you think it's an omen?

104
00:04:52,045 --> 00:04:53,925
-[band continues playing loudly]
-Right?

105
00:04:54,005 --> 00:04:55,325
Now watch.

106
00:04:57,085 --> 00:04:58,885
[silence]

107
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:01,525
-What about that?
-Whoa!

108
00:05:01,605 --> 00:05:04,725
I tell you, girls, the double glazing,
it'll change your life.

109
00:05:04,805 --> 00:05:07,445
Yes, as I said, it's...

110
00:05:07,525 --> 00:05:10,725
it's very impressive, Jim,
but we're actually in a bit of a hurry,

111
00:05:10,805 --> 00:05:12,445
so if we could just grab that tent--

112
00:05:13,125 --> 00:05:14,805
[band plays loudly]

113
00:05:17,125 --> 00:05:18,325
[silence]

114
00:05:19,285 --> 00:05:21,085
Mind-blowing.

115
00:05:21,165 --> 00:05:22,925
[Mary] What are they, stilts?

116
00:05:23,805 --> 00:05:25,205
Golf clubs.

117
00:05:25,285 --> 00:05:27,565
I thought... spatulas.

118
00:05:27,645 --> 00:05:31,085
{\an8}-They're rifles.
-[Sarah] Really? Are you sure?

119
00:05:31,165 --> 00:05:32,485
Fairly sure.

120
00:05:32,565 --> 00:05:36,645
I also don't understand what connection
spatulas, golf clubs or stilts

121
00:05:36,725 --> 00:05:38,525
would have to the Irish Resistance.

122
00:05:38,605 --> 00:05:40,765
Christ, he's a dose.

123
00:05:40,845 --> 00:05:42,365
Right. Once your tent is erect...

124
00:05:42,445 --> 00:05:43,645
[snorts]

125
00:05:43,725 --> 00:05:46,165
...you'll want to think about
where to safely store your food,

126
00:05:46,245 --> 00:05:48,205
because believe me, girls,

127
00:05:48,285 --> 00:05:51,485
you do not want to attract predatory
animals into your sleeping area.

128
00:05:52,405 --> 00:05:54,525
Bears are particularly vicious.

129
00:05:54,605 --> 00:05:57,205
Yeah, I'm not sure how many bears
there are in Portnoo, though, Jim.

130
00:05:57,285 --> 00:05:59,285
But there was a cheetah
on the beach one time.

131
00:05:59,365 --> 00:06:00,645
That was a greyhound, Orla.

132
00:06:01,605 --> 00:06:03,005
I know what I saw.

133
00:06:08,645 --> 00:06:10,765
Gave you the Intrepid, did he?

134
00:06:10,845 --> 00:06:13,205
That's his second-best tent, you know.

135
00:06:13,285 --> 00:06:15,085
Tell you what, son.

136
00:06:15,165 --> 00:06:16,885
I'm putting you in charge of it, okay?

137
00:06:16,965 --> 00:06:19,125
Oh, please don't.
Please, don't put me in charge of it.

138
00:06:19,205 --> 00:06:20,965
You'll be all right.

139
00:06:21,045 --> 00:06:24,205
Right, there's too many of us for one car.
Some of you'll have to go with my da.

140
00:06:24,285 --> 00:06:25,405
Can I? Can I?

141
00:06:25,485 --> 00:06:28,165
'Cause Joe drives really fast.

142
00:06:28,245 --> 00:06:31,405
He, like, runs through red lights and
takes corners on two wheels. It is class!

143
00:06:31,485 --> 00:06:33,085
It really is.

144
00:06:33,165 --> 00:06:35,285
I think I'll hop in with Mr. Quinn,
if that's okay.

145
00:06:35,365 --> 00:06:36,525
Me too.

146
00:06:36,605 --> 00:06:37,925
I'll go with me da. He lets me smoke.

147
00:06:38,005 --> 00:06:41,245
You're coming? What about the grave
danger we're putting ourselves in?

148
00:06:41,325 --> 00:06:45,765
It's a concern, but so is the fact I have
nothing in for me Sunday dinner, so...

149
00:06:45,845 --> 00:06:47,725
All right, Joe, if you just follow me.

150
00:06:48,965 --> 00:06:51,125
Now, why should I follow you?

151
00:06:51,205 --> 00:06:53,085
-I've got the map.
-Aye.

152
00:06:53,165 --> 00:06:56,005
-Well, now I have the map.
-Ach, Da.

153
00:06:56,085 --> 00:06:59,165
Joe, it's all just a bit trickier today.

154
00:06:59,245 --> 00:07:00,685
There are so many roadblocks up.

155
00:07:00,765 --> 00:07:03,285
There are so many diversions and,
you know, I drive for a living.

156
00:07:03,365 --> 00:07:05,645
He says this like it's something
to be proud of.

157
00:07:05,725 --> 00:07:07,805
Look, we just need
to get out of this place as quickly

158
00:07:07,885 --> 00:07:09,965
and as quietly as possible.

159
00:07:10,925 --> 00:07:12,845
You know what age I am, boy?

160
00:07:12,925 --> 00:07:15,525
You know how many of these parades
I've lived through?

161
00:07:17,765 --> 00:07:21,045
You think I don't realize
how quickly a situation can turn?

162
00:07:22,005 --> 00:07:24,685
Do you think I'd do anything
to put my family at risk?

163
00:07:24,765 --> 00:07:27,405
No, of course not. I'm sorry.

164
00:07:29,205 --> 00:07:30,605
Aye.

165
00:07:30,685 --> 00:07:33,005
What are you looking at,
you tangerine toe?

166
00:07:33,085 --> 00:07:34,765
[Erin] Okay, Granda.

167
00:07:34,845 --> 00:07:37,845
I think what's happened here is,

00:14:58,765 --> 00:15:00,205
Well, it's a risk we have to take.

333
00:15:00,285 --> 00:15:01,485
No, it's not, Joe.

334
00:15:01,565 --> 00:15:04,085
It's not a risk we have to take.
It's a risk we shouldn't take.

335
00:15:04,165 --> 00:15:07,485
-Don't you take that tone with me, boy.
-He seems like a nice enough fella.

336
00:15:07,565 --> 00:15:09,805
-We have to walk away from this.
-[Erin] What if we can't?

337
00:15:09,885 --> 00:15:12,845
What if we don't help him and
he kills us all because we know too much?

338
00:15:12,925 --> 00:15:15,285
I like him. I think he's a character.

339
00:15:17,565 --> 00:15:19,405
-Well?
-Just a cup of tea for me, please, love.

340
00:15:19,485 --> 00:15:21,725
-Same here.
-[Joe] And here, thanks, love.

341
00:15:21,805 --> 00:15:25,285
Oh, and some Cokes for the wains, please.
What do you fancy, Sarah?

342
00:15:25,365 --> 00:15:28,365
-I wouldn't mind a wee vodka.
-Make that two.

343
00:15:28,445 --> 00:15:31,645
-We don't sell alcohol.
-[baby cries]

344
00:15:31,725 --> 00:15:34,205
-I'll take a tea.
-Any food?

345
00:15:34,285 --> 00:15:36,125
We're just looking.

346
00:15:36,205 --> 00:15:38,805
-[scoffs] Fine.
-[Gerry] Yeah.

347
00:15:38,885 --> 00:15:41,925
And at 2.25 a burger,
looking is all we'll be doing.

348
00:15:42,005 --> 00:15:43,605
Ah, don't mind me. Just grabbing a knife.

349
00:15:45,685 --> 00:15:48,765
-Take it you haven't decided yet.
-Just leave it with me, son.

350
00:15:48,845 --> 00:15:51,765
Aye, no pressure.
I'll be over here if you need me.

351
00:15:52,845 --> 00:15:54,445
What the hell does he need a knife for?

352
00:15:54,525 --> 00:15:56,085
He's eating his lunch.

353
00:15:56,165 --> 00:15:58,885
God, but he has great teeth, doesn't he?

354
00:15:58,965 --> 00:16:02,445
He really does, but...
now, tell the truth.

355
00:16:02,525 --> 00:16:05,285
The hair. Can you see a ginger tinge?

356
00:16:05,365 --> 00:16:06,965
[Sarah] Now that you mention it...

357
00:16:07,885 --> 00:16:10,285
So Christ only knows
what's lurking downstairs.

358
00:16:10,365 --> 00:16:12,125
And that is a concern.

359
00:16:12,205 --> 00:16:15,325
But spending the rest of your life
with a fugitive is less of a concern?

360
00:16:16,285 --> 00:16:17,685
Absolutely.

361
00:16:17,765 --> 00:16:20,205
[pop song plays]

362
00:16:23,765 --> 00:16:26,165
-Hey.
-All right?

363
00:16:31,045 --> 00:16:32,245
I think you know who I am.

364
00:16:32,325 --> 00:16:33,325
Yeah.

365
00:16:33,405 --> 00:16:34,925
You sense it.

366
00:16:35,005 --> 00:16:36,925
No, I mean I remember. You're with them.

367
00:16:38,045 --> 00:16:40,325
Look, I just wanted to say, well,

368
00:16:40,405 --> 00:16:43,005
-there's obviously something between us.
-There is?

369
00:16:43,085 --> 00:16:45,685
The physical thing
isn't really working for me yet.

370
00:16:45,765 --> 00:16:48,125
-Right.
-I'm not saying you won't grow on me.

371
00:16:48,205 --> 00:16:50,605
-You're not a bad-looking lad.
-Thank you.

372
00:16:50,685 --> 00:16:54,365
But the ginger element... well,
I've sort of got a borderline phobia.

373
00:16:54,445 --> 00:16:56,365
-I'm not ginger.
-There's a tinge, Emmett.

374
00:16:56,445 --> 00:17:00,845
And while I can't say it won't
be a struggle, I'm willing to try.

375
00:17:02,045 --> 00:17:03,325
Great.

376
00:17:03,405 --> 00:17:05,965
Even though it sort of turns my stomach.

377
00:17:06,045 --> 00:17:07,485
Okay.

378
00:17:09,725 --> 00:17:12,965
You really think this'll work?
That they'll tell us what to do?

379
00:17:13,045 --> 00:17:14,805
Sure, it's worth a try.

380
00:17:14,885 --> 00:17:17,405
Oh! Would you look at that?

381
00:17:17,485 --> 00:17:21,565
-What? What do they say?
-I think-- Now, I can't be certain,

382
00:17:21,645 --> 00:17:25,645
but I think they're saying
you should leave Gerry.

383
00:17:27,125 --> 00:17:29,245
I could have told you that years ago,
and I'm not psychic.

384
00:17:29,325 --> 00:17:30,645
[sighs] Okay.

385
00:17:30,725 --> 00:17:32,845
Look, I've yet to hear
anybody say anything

386
00:17:32,925 --> 00:17:35,885
to convince me that bringing that lad
across the border with us is a good idea.

387
00:17:35,965 --> 00:17:37,005
Shit, he's coming.

388
00:17:40,045 --> 00:17:42,085
I really didn't wanna have to do this.

389
00:17:42,165 --> 00:17:43,885
Jesus Christ!

390
00:17:43,965 --> 00:17:46,525
Get down! Everybody get down!

391
00:17:46,605 --> 00:17:48,845
-Is there something wrong with her?
-Stop that, Erin.

392
00:17:52,965 --> 00:17:54,925
Sorry, Emmett. You were saying?

393
00:17:55,485 --> 00:17:57,285
Didn't wanna put you in this position.

394
00:17:57,365 --> 00:18:00,205
But I can't stress the seriousness
of my situation.

395
00:18:00,285 --> 00:18:01,805
-Anything else?
-Oh, do you know what?

396
00:18:01,885 --> 00:18:05,085
-I wouldn't mind a knickerbocker glory.
-Right.

397
00:18:06,765 --> 00:18:09,845
-You need to help me out here.
-We do that and we're breaking the law.

398
00:18:09,925 --> 00:18:14,005
You recognize the legal system of
a brutal, imperialistic oppressor, do you?

399
00:18:14,085 --> 00:18:16,645
If they can put me in jail for 20 years,
then, yes, Emmett. Yes, I do.

400
00:18:16,725 --> 00:18:19,365
Listen, listen.
Have you killed anyone, son?

401
00:18:19,445 --> 00:18:22,405
No. Well, at least not directly.

402
00:18:22,485 --> 00:18:24,845
Well, there you go. So that settles it.

403
00:18:24,925 --> 00:18:27,045
I don't think that does settle it,
actually, Joe.

404
00:18:27,125 --> 00:18:29,205
You know what's wrong with you, Gerry?

405
00:18:29,285 --> 00:18:31,765
-You're an awful wuss.
-I'm not a wuss.

406
00:18:31,845 --> 00:18:34,405
-You're afraid of your own shadow.
-No, I'm not.

407
00:18:34,485 --> 00:18:36,245
Well, then grow a set of balls
and help the fella out.

408
00:18:36,325 --> 00:18:39,605

thank you very much.

00:18:39,685 --> 00:18:42,045

-You're even afraid of that wee girl.

410
00:18:42,125 --> 00:18:43,925
-What wee girl?
-That waitress.

411
00:18:44,845 --> 00:18:46,365
You wanted a cup of tea.

412
00:18:46,445 --> 00:18:49,365
She brought you a Coke and you just sat
there and said sweet Fanny Adams.

413
00:18:49,445 --> 00:18:51,325
[snickers] Your granda said "fanny".

414
00:18:51,405 --> 00:18:52,925
Well, that's because I like Coke.

415
00:18:53,005 --> 00:18:55,725
-Her customer service is shocking as well.
-Aye, desperate.

416
00:18:55,805 --> 00:18:58,205
-[Sarah] Someone should say something.
-Aye, Gerry!

417
00:18:58,285 --> 00:18:59,765
Gerry should say something.

418
00:19:00,365 --> 00:19:02,245
I will. No problem.

419
00:19:02,325 --> 00:19:03,525
I'll say something.

420
00:19:06,445 --> 00:19:07,605
Excuse me.

421
00:19:08,565 --> 00:19:09,765
Excuse me, please.

422
00:19:14,525 --> 00:19:15,725
What?

423
00:19:16,285 --> 00:19:18,925
Um, I just wanted to say that,
uh, I, um...

424
00:19:19,005 --> 00:19:22,445
I ordered a tea. You brought me a Coke,
and that's not acceptable.

425
00:19:22,525 --> 00:19:24,925
-But you drank the Coke.
-That's not the point.

426
00:19:26,405 --> 00:19:30,405
And your service has been nothing short
of appalling. Your attitude is worse.

427
00:19:30,485 --> 00:19:31,765

I'll, uh...

I'll bring you a tea.

430
00:19:35,325 --> 00:19:36,445
You do that.

00:19:38,725 --> 00:19:39,885

I'm sorry.

437
00:19:57,725 --> 00:19:59,645
-I'll just--
-No, no, no.

438
00:19:59,725 --> 00:20:00,965
Ignore all that.

no need for that.

-Jesus, Gerry.
-Harsh.

-Awful.
-Poor girl.

00:20:22,885 --> 00:20:24,165
You asked me to.

How could I have known?

447
00:20:27,485 --> 00:20:30,045
And would you all just stop
looking at me?

448
00:20:31,485 --> 00:20:33,005
Fine.

00:20:33,645 --> 00:20:34,845

that my accent was flawless.

We have to decide what to do here,
one way or another.

-Let's just vote.
-Leave him!

I vote we run away and leave him.

for better or worse and all that.

I vote we take him.

-Me too.
-I can't decide.

463
00:21:17,445 --> 00:21:20,685
I decided, but I'm afraid
to say what I've decided.

-A harp.
-So harp must be the head

-and fish must be the tail?
-Oh, that makes sense.

475
00:22:06,165 --> 00:22:08,285
Yeah, because fish have tails.
