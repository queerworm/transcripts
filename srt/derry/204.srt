00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:06,280
For "Rock the Boat"? Really?

174
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:10,160
But your girls pushed him out of the line,
and now he has a bruise.

175
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,440
Show them the bruise, Eammon.

176
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,080
I bruise quite easily.

177
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,400
That's not the point.

178
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:16,160
[Mary]
Right, I see.

179
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,720
I'm sorry about that, Eammon.

180
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:19,680
Is that all you have to say?

181
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:22,160
I'm not sure what else
there is to say, Bridie,

182
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,200
except maybe, our girls are 16

183
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:26,600
and Eammon's a 50-year-old man.

184
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,760
Look, it's a rough routine, Bridie.

185
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:30,000
You know that going in.

186
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,320
You sit down on that floor
at your own risk.

187
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,600
<i>♪ ...love and devotion... ♪</i>

188
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:38,320
You are seriously not going to
pull them up about this?

189
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,480
No, Bridie, we're not.

190
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,600
It's "Rock the Boat."

191
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,840
Well, that certainly
explains a few things.

192
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,200
What's that supposed to mean?

193
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:46,960
It means that a bit of discipline
would do those girls no harm.

194
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:49,280
They have been running about all day
like a couple of wild animals.

195
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,680
OK, that'll do, Bridie.

196
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:52,760
But then the apple never did
fall far from the tree.

197
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:53,640
Mammy, please.

198
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,440
Yous girls never did know how
to conduct yourselves.

199
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:56,760
Nothing but a pair of hallions.

200
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:58,480
Come on now, Bridie,
that's enough of that.

201
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:01,320
Not that they need you to defend them,
you big pair of knickers.

202
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:03,160
It wasn't my poor sister's fault.

203
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,960
She tried her best with both of you,

204
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,600
but you're your father's
daughters, all right.

205
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:08,400
I'd rein it in now, if I were you.

206
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:11,640
I really think you were
a disappointment to her, you know.

207
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:13,120
Now hold on a goddamn minute.

208
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,440
Daddy, you will not dignify that
with a response.

209
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:16,840
And I'll tell you something else.

210
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,920
If your mother saw thon hat,

211
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,200
she'd be turning in her grave,
for it's nothing but a bloody eyesore.

212
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:24,400
Ach, drop dead, you spiteful old hag.

I just cannot believe it.

223
00:08:44,679 --> 00:08:45,679
Listen, Mary,

224
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:48,320
no matter what you've done,
you're still my sister.

225
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,920
I'll stand by you.

226
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,560
I haven't done anything, Sarah.

227
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:54,800
Exactly, love. Everybody knows
you didn't mean to kill the old boot.

228
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:55,880
God rest her soul.

229
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:58,080
-I didn't kill her.
-You know what I mean.

230
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,120
Not kill. Hex.

231
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,760
I didn't hex her either, Da.

232
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,680
It was just a very tragic--

233
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,840
My mother,
she had the gift too, you know.

234
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:09,160
By God, that woman
could make her enemies drop like flies.

235
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:11,360
Look, I don't have any gift.

236
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,400
There's no dark forces at play here.

237
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:15,040
I just said something

238
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,920
unfortunate that happened to--

239
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,920
-Cause her death?
-Coincide with her death.

240
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:20,920
Right, well, that's the dishes done.

241
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,680
Would you like another cup
of tea there, Mammy?

242
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:23,680
No, I'm fine.

243
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,200
I'll just grab the Hoover,
give the stairs a bit of a going over.

244
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:27,760
And I'll maybe do a bit of dusting.

245
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,400
What's gotten into you two?

246
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:31,240
What are you up to?
What do you want?

247
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:34,720
Nothing. We just thought that we should
pull our weight a bit more, Mammy.

248
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,680
You do so much for us, Aunt Mary.

249
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:38,120
You deserve a bit of a break.

250
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:41,000
I can't hex people, girls.
It was an accident.

251
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,120
So, how's
the wicked witch of the northwest?

252
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,400
Who put 50p in the eejit?

253
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:47,560
God, how am I going to go to this wake?

254
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:48,840
It'll be grand, love.

255
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:53,000
But, listen, say if things do get heated,
try not to rise to it.

256
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:56,080
The last thing we want
is another dead body on our hands here.

257
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,120
I'll do my best, Da.

258
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,600
So good of you to come.

259
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,080
This is a big turnout.

260
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:11,640
Well, Mammy was just so well-liked.

261
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:13,160
Right. Really?

262
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:15,880
I suppose, because she was
the life and soul, wasn't she?

263
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:18,120
Full of the joys, always laughing.

264
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,480
-We're talking about Bridie, aren't we?
-Yes, Da.

265
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,920
Look, Mary,
there's something I need to say.

266
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,120
Is this about the curse, Eammon?

267
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,000
Sorry?

268
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:28,880
Because Mary said she didn't do it,
and that's good enough for us.

269
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:32,040
That's the truth, Eammon. I wouldn't know
where to start with all that carry-on.

270
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:35,440
No, Mary, no. I-I was just going to say
that my poor mother,

271
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:36,720
God bless her and keep her...

272
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:37,880
Amen.

273
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,840
...she didn't mean
what she said at the wedding.

274
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,280
Please, you don't need to explain.

275
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,960
You were worried I'd think
you'd put a curse on her?

276
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:45,520
-Well...
-[laughs]

277
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,760
That's hilarious.

278
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:47,760
[laughs] Aye.

279
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:51,760
I mean, obviously,
a curse was my first thought,

280
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:54,920
but I looked into it, and Mammy's death,

281
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,560
it doesn't meet the official requirements,

282
00:10:57,640 --> 00:11:00,280
so you're completely in the clear
on that front, Mary.

283
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,840
Nothing to worry about at all.

284
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,400
Great.

285
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:08,160
We brought some bits.
Should we just leave them here?

286
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,960
-[Sister Michael] Genius.
-Sister.

287
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:11,120
How are you?

288
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:14,240
Well, I'm at a wake, Mr. Quinn,
so I've had better evenings.

289
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,440
Did you know Bridie, then?

290
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:18,680
No, but I believe your wife
put some sort of curse on her.

291
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:20,000
Well, no, not exactly.

292
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,840
You're not a tongue person, are you?

293
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,120
I'm sorry?

294
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,480
I'm on communion duty.

295
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:27,600
Christ, but I cannot stand
the tongue people.

296
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:28,720
I mean, what's all that about?

297
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,480
You can't lift a wafer
into your own mouth?

298
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:31,720
You need me to do it for you?

299
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:34,720
Right, yeah.
That--that--that must be tough.

300
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,440
Father Thomas usually
deals with the wakes,

301
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:38,880
but he's very sick at the moment.
Bedridden, in fact.

302
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,720
God, what caused it?

303
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,840
Jack Daniel's, mostly.

304
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:43,800
I see.

305
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:45,080
I'll take them.

306
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:46,160
Lovely stuff.

307
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:50,000
I need six rounds of cheese and ham,
four rounds of egg and cress,

308
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,200
and three rounds of tuna.

309
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:53,640
Cut the cheese and ham in triangles,

310
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:55,440
the egg and cress in rectangles,

311
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:57,840
and the tuna, well, you can freestyle.

312
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,760
I'd get buttering, if I were you.

313
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:01,840
Grand so.

314
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:05,760
She really suits being dead, doesn't she?

315
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:06,960
What?

316
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,240
Can we come in?

317
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,360
Why are you whispering?

318
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:11,560
I don't know.

319
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:15,400
Thanks for coming, guys.

320
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:18,440
It's nice to have a bit of support
at this very difficult time.

321
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:20,640
-You thought she was a dick.
-I never said that.

322
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,640
-You did, Erin.
-I've definitely heard you say it.

323
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,480
OK, can I just check something?

324
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,960
Everybody else
can see the dead body, right?

325
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:29,000
It's just Bridie.

326
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:32,720
It's Bridie's corpse.
It's Bridie's dead corpse.

327
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,320
It's her wake. What were you expecting?

328
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,400
Haven't you ever seen
a dead body before?

329
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:37,520
Of course not.

330
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,240
Christ, but the English are weird.

331
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:40,960
You can touch her if you want.

332
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,360
Why the hell would I want to touch her?

333
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,120
-It's nice.
-Stop it.

334
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,480
It's just a dead body, James.
We're all going to be one someday.

335
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:50,360
Oh, thanks for that, Clare.
Yeah, that's helped.

336
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:52,400
It really makes you think, doesn't it?

337
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,720
Death.

338
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:56,280
Just makes you want to

339
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:59,520
do everything and just try everything.

340
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,080
What's going on, Michelle?

341
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:02,680
Do yous want to see something class?

342
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:05,440
What is it?

343
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:06,480
Prepare yourself, girls.

00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:11,520
Scones.

346
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:12,480
That's right.

347
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:13,720
What's so class about scones?

348
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:14,720
Scones are lovely.

349
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:15,760
Aye, I like scones.

350
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:17,800
No, these aren't any old scones, girls.

351
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,280
These are funny scones.

352
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,840
Aye, they do look like good craic,
in fairness.

353
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:22,720
Funny scones.

354
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,800
They're drug scones!
She's put the drugs in the scones!

355
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:27,160
Too fucking right, I have.

356
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,360
I wanted to do brownies,

357
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:30,480
but this was the only recipe
my ma had, so...

358
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,360
We talked about this, Michelle.
We agreed.

359
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:33,240
No, we didn't.

360
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:36,040
Anyway, drugs aren't illegal
when you put them into food.

361
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,080
Everybody knows that.

362
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:39,240
Is that right?
I'm not sure that's right.

363
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:42,560
Any cups up here? I'll take that.

364
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:49,360
What the fuck just happened?

365
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:52,880
Three cheese and tomato on brown bread.

366
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,120
Brown, right. Got it.

367
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,600
Four salad on white.

368
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,680
Salad, white.
Hang on, rectangles or triangles?

369
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:58,840
Two with no onion.

370
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:00,440
We're low on vol-au-vents, Gerry.

371
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:02,000
That quiche isn't cooked, Gerry.

372
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,720
Sweet suffering Jesus.

373
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:08,280
And now, I don't mind a bit of a breeze--
if anything, I prefer it--

374
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:10,520
but thon was aggressive.

375
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:15,000
So I says to meself, says I,
"Colm, this is no day for a do."

376
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,000
What's happening?

377
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,440
For when the bride arrived--

378
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:19,920
and as I say,
by this stage the wind was fierce...

379
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,720
-Am I dead?
-I've never heard wind like it.

380
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:23,840
Is this my wake?

381
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,920
Howling like a banshee, it was.

382
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,040
Am I in hell?

383
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:29,600
So, the poor girl, the bride now, this is,

384
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:33,600
she arrives anyway,
and isn't she no sooner out of the car,

385
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:37,400
than she's lifted up in the air,
like a paper doll,

386
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:39,760
and blown into a flowerbed.

387
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:44,160
That's actually quite funny.

388
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:55,040
What are we gonna do?
What in under God are we going to do?

389
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,880
-It's fine.
-It's definitely not fine.

390
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:59,440
There's drug scones down there.
If people eat the drug scones,

391
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:01,280
then we've drugged those people,
Michelle.

392
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,200
So? Drugging people isn't a crime.

393
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:04,920
You've a very loose grasp of the law,
Michelle.

394
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,480
What kind of person
brings hash scones to a wake?

395
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:10,400
Typical. I try and do a nice thing,
and this is the thanks I get.

396
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,280
It's terrible.
There's old people down there.

397
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:13,800
What if an old person takes one?

398
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:16,160
Why does everybody get
so sentimental about old people?

399
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:17,520
Old people are arseholes.

400
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,960
We have to get them back.

401
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,680
Look, I'm not disagreeing with you.

402
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:23,960
I bought that stuff so I could get high,
not your great uncle Colm.

403
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:25,880
Christ, can you imagine?

404
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:28,160
Hold on a minute.
Where did the scones go?

405
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:30,720
OK, I'll head for the kitchen
and grab whatever's still there.

406
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,800
The rest of you look out
for any ones that have gone rogue,

407
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,880
and remember, be subtle.

408
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:44,360
I need to take your scone.

409
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:46,280
The thing is, I just have
so many questions about God,

410
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:47,440
about life after death.

411
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:48,400
Go away, please.

412
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,440
And I try to silence my doubts,
I really do, but lately--

413
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:51,480
I don't believe it.

414
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:54,400
-Why?
-I'm not allowed to say.

415
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:55,480
OK.

416
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:56,800
Thank you.

417
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,880
What's wrong, Sister?

418
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,360
[sniffs]

419
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:02,960
Are these cinnamon?

420
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,440
Do you like cinnamon?

421
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:06,200
I can't be doing with cinnamon.

422
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:08,840
Then that's what they are.
Absolutely. 100%.

423
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,320
Where are the scallions?

424
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:14,520
How can you make a salad sandwich,
if you don't have scallions?

425
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:17,240
I asked for them ten minutes ago.
Come on, now, people.

426
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:18,720
Let's get it together, please!

427
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:22,440
And there's a multipack of Taytos
still waiting to be bowled up.

428
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:25,360
No cross-contamination this time.

429
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,320
I want cheese and onion in one bowl,

430
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:29,280
salt and vinegar in another.

431
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,560
It is not that difficult, folks.

432
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:33,680
Listen here, you.

433
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:35,080
Yes, Joe.

434
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,120
I just want to say...

435
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:43,160
[laughs]

436
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:47,400
I think you're doing a fine job.

437
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:51,560
Keep up the good work.

438
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,560
[timer dings]

439
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:02,040
Ach, when all is said and done,
she wasn't a bad old soul.

440
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:04,840
I was actually quite fond of her,
you know.

441
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:09,040
And I really hope she's up there now,
looking down on us both, thinking...

442
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,160
what in under Christ?

443
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,920
Aye, me too, Mary.

444
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,760
No, Sarah.

445
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:19,440
Look. The earrings. Look at the earrings.

446
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,160
God, aye.

447
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:24,359
I wouldn't have put a drop on her.
She doesn't have enough neck.

448
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:26,160
She'd have been better with a stud.

449
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,760
They're Mammy's.
She's wearing Mammy's earrings.

450
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:32,520
So they are! How did she get them?

451
00:17:32,599 --> 00:17:36,440
She probably swooped in like a vulture
before Mammy drew her last breath,

452
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:39,800
and now the old bitch
is getting buried in them.

453
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:41,200
Has the woman no shame?

454
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:44,320
Earrings like that don't deserve to be
buried alive. It's a sin.

455
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,360
She is doing this to spite us,
you know.

456
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,480
-What should we do?
-I don't know.

457
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:54,000
[whispering]
We could replace them with exact replicas.

458
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:56,160
Right.

459
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:59,120
We don't have exact replicas,
is the thing, though.

460
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,760
True enough, Mary. True enough.

461
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:05,120
[Michelle]
I can't believe we're doing this.

462
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,320
It's fuckin' heartbreaking.

463
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:09,480
Look, Granda's had one,
and now he's acting really, really weird.

464
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:11,160
-You're being paranoid.
-He was nice to Daddy.

465
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:12,520
-Jesus.
-Exactly.

466
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:14,280
And if my ma starts asking questions...

467
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:15,560
Your ma won't trace it back to us

468
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:17,280
Are you for real?
She traces everything back to us.

469
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:19,160
She traces things
we haven't even done back to us.

470
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:20,400
Are you sure this will work?

471
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:21,840
This is how you get rid of drugs, Clare.

472
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,440
I've seen<i> GoodFellas, </i>like, 20 times.

473
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,360
That's not the only way.

474
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:28,240
I watched this film once about this girl
who was trying to hide drugs,

475
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:30,960
and what she did was,
she shoved them right up her--

476
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:34,000
I'm not sticking a scone up my hole, Orla,
I'll tell you that for nothing.

477
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,800
-OK, I'm going to flush.
-Go for it.

478
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,080
[flushes toilet]

479
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:38,720
[water gurgling in pipes]

480
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,320
Is it working?

481
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,480
Course it's working.

482
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:43,560
[water gurgling]

483
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:44,800
Is the water rising?

484
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,600
Jesus Christ.
Why is the water rising, James?

485
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:48,880
Don't know.
The water didn't rise in<i> GoodFellas.</i>

486
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:51,680
-Fuck. We've clogged it.
-Who has a plunger?

487
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:55,080
I'm afraid I left the house
without my plunger tonight, Orla.

488
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:57,280
Aye, me too. Nightmare, so it is.

489
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:00,200
[all]
Oh, whoa!

490
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:01,080
Hurry up.

491
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:04,240
You mind your own ear, Mary.
Don't concern yourself with mine.

492
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:05,560
It won't budge.

493
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:07,840
What are they, like,
glued on or something?

494
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:08,760
Pull harder.

495
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:10,360
I'm pulling as hard as I can.

496
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,320
-Oh! Got it.
-[door opens]

497
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:16,240
Mary, look, this is a bit awkward,

498
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:19,640
but there's been a few complaints
from the kitchen about Gerry.

499
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:22,600
Ach, Eammon, how are you?
What brings you here?

500
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:24,400
Ah, it's my mother's wake.

501
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,880
Ach, God, so it is.

502
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,400
What's going on?

503
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:36,080
We just came in
to do a wee decade of the rosary,

504
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:38,080
and sure, didn't Sarah forget her beads.

505
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,640
What am I not?

506
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:42,840
What's in your hand?

507
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:44,440
Sorry?

508
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:46,840
-What have you got in your hand?
-Nothing.

509
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,480
Let me see.

510
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:51,720
Your other hand.

511
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:54,640
-The other hand?
-Yes.

512
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:00,120
Oh, how did that get there?

513
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,560
Jeepers.

514
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:04,440
Were you stealing Mammy's earrings?

515
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:08,480
Actually, I think you'll find they were
our mother's earrings, originally, so...

516
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:09,600
What is wrong with you?

517
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:11,720
We were doing her a favor, Eammon.

518
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:13,000
They're not flattering.

519
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:16,600
For God's sake, Mary.
First the curse, now this?

520
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:17,760
You said there was no curse.

521
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,600
I didn't want to make you angry, Mary.

522
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:23,040
I mean, I'm about to bury my mother.
A hex is the last thing I need.

523
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:24,400
Oh, for Jesus' sake.

524
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:25,320
Urgh.

525
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,440
[water dripping]

526
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:28,160
What is that?

528
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:38,320

[water sloshing]

530
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,480
Dear God.

531
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:43,800
It looks worse than it is.

532
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:46,040
[Eammon]
My mother was right about you people.

533
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:48,520
Wild animals would have more manners.

534
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:50,160
We didn't have a plunger, Eammon.

535
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:51,480
Get out!

536
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:53,480

541
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:07,640
I'm still devastated
about Mammy's earrings, Mary.

542
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:08,760
We were so close.

543
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:10,520
Well, they're six foot under now,

544

-It is a bad idea, Sarah.

546

It's a very bad idea.

547

I just want to forget the whole thing.

548
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,520
How's your scoots now, Erin, love?

549
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:24,240
Aye, they're clearing up, I think.

550

I still don't understand

553
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:32,480
why you had to bring
all of your friends in there with you.

554
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:34,000
I panicked, Daddy.

555
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,960
Can we please stop talking
about Erin's scoots?

560

I've never tasted anything like it.

561
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:49,880
So, I bagged us up a couple.

-Happy days.
