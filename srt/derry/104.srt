She didn't send a photo.

Her family probably
don't even own a camera.

6
00:00:29,965 --> 00:00:32,365
She'll find Derry
a bit overwhelming at first,

7
00:00:32,445 --> 00:00:34,725
just because of how advanced
everything is here.

stuff where she comes from, too, Erin.

Oh, really? Like what?

00:00:42,405 --> 00:00:44,645

No.

You can get this wee woman
made of wood, right?

14
00:00:48,885 --> 00:00:53,365
You pull her apart and inside her
there's an even weer wooden woman,

Are you talking about Russian dolls?

What are you doing?

18
00:01:02,565 --> 00:01:03,845
Taking my change.

19
00:01:03,925 --> 00:01:05,685
Sarah, you don't get change.

20
00:01:05,765 --> 00:01:09,165
Aye, dead on, Gerry.
I'm gonna give them a whole fiver?

21
00:01:09,245 --> 00:01:11,445
That's definitely happening.

22
00:01:14,005 --> 00:01:15,245
Did you just wink?

23
00:01:15,845 --> 00:01:17,045
No.

24
00:01:17,125 --> 00:01:18,165
You did.

25
00:01:18,245 --> 00:01:19,645
You just winked.

26
00:01:19,725 --> 00:01:23,085
Sure, winking's not in my notion, Mary.
What would I have to be winking about?

27
00:01:23,165 --> 00:01:26,005
I don't know. I'll find out.

their wee lungs a bit of a clear out,

because, ah, sure, there's all sorts
wafting about in their neck of the woods.

34
00:01:46,365 --> 00:01:49,125
Lovely job so far, Seamus,
but, you know, keep it moving.

00:01:50,805 --> 00:01:56,565
Now, one might well question the wisdom
of sending you here, of all places.

37
00:01:57,005 --> 00:01:59,005
Out of the frying pan into the...

38
00:01:59,085 --> 00:02:02,685
well, maybe not the fire, but certainly
a different type of frying pan.

39
00:02:02,765 --> 00:02:05,605
Or some sort of wok at the very least.

40
00:02:06,365 --> 00:02:11,045

you need to know.

Hmm. It's much how I imagine.

Oh, because of my letters?

51
00:02:46,725 --> 00:02:49,565
Well, descriptive narrative
has always been a strong point.

52
00:02:49,645 --> 00:02:52,045
No, not your letters.
I see on news.

53
00:02:52,125 --> 00:02:53,925
What do you mean,
you've seen on news?

54
00:02:54,005 --> 00:02:56,685
You don't have news in the Ukraine.
You don't have televisions.

-Yes, we do. We do.
-[Erin] No, you don't. Really?

00:02:59,365 --> 00:03:00,565
Of course.

Yeah, come on, Erin.

00:04:57,645 --> 00:05:01,085
Well, there's actually
a political element to it, Katya,

00:05:01,165 --> 00:05:02,485
and there's a religious element.

Mmm, but you're not
two different religions here.

You're different flavors
of same religion, no?

Well, yes, but...

-It's hard to tell.

Well, if he's not enjoying it,
isn't that sort of sexual harassment?

Right. Shay Harkin was telling me

yesterday lunchtime.

00:06:26,365 --> 00:06:27,765
That's hardly news.

-I often do.

142
00:06:34,685 --> 00:06:36,045
A cream horn?

143
00:06:36,125 --> 00:06:38,285
That's not like you, Granda.

144
00:06:38,365 --> 00:06:40,485
Sure, you couldn't pay you
to eat a cream horn.

145
00:06:40,565 --> 00:06:43,205
Cream finger, it was.
Apple turnover and a cream finger.

146
00:06:43,285 --> 00:06:44,685
Cream horn, Shay said.

147
00:06:44,765 --> 00:06:46,125
Horns, fingers. Who cares?

148

He swore on it.
Said he saw it being bagged up.

Big Shay has eyes like a hawk, so he does.

150

you turned up Pump Street.

152
00:06:55,205 --> 00:06:57,205
Who do you know on Pump Street, Da?

153
00:06:57,285 --> 00:07:01,085
What were you doing heading up
Pump Street with a cream horn, Da?

154
00:07:01,165 --> 00:07:03,045

-What friend?

-A new friend.
-A male friend, was it?

-What station?
-Jesus falls for the second time.

161

Maeve and me, we--

163
00:07:21,845 --> 00:07:23,045
We just get on well, that's all.

164
00:07:23,125 --> 00:07:25,685
-Maeve? That's her name, is it?
-Yes, that's right.

165
00:07:25,765 --> 00:07:27,525
[Mary] Maeve.
That's what she's called, is she?

166
00:07:27,605 --> 00:07:30,485
-She is, aye.
-Maeve. Maeve. Really?

167
00:07:30,565 --> 00:07:32,845
-Maeve?
-Why does your mother make that sound?

168
00:07:32,925 --> 00:07:34,805
-I cannot believe this.
-I think it's a good thing, love.

169
00:07:34,885 --> 00:07:36,245
Just keep out of it, you.

170
00:07:36,325 --> 00:07:38,725
And that's who you
were winking at in mass?

171
00:07:38,805 --> 00:07:42,125
-Winking? At your age?
-Mm-hmm.

172
00:07:42,205 --> 00:07:44,285

She's just using you.

342
00:15:56,325 --> 00:15:59,125
Yeah, but the thing is, I don't care.

343
00:15:59,845 --> 00:16:01,805
I won't let you.
I won't let you do it.

344
00:16:01,885 --> 00:16:03,165
You can't stop me.

345
00:16:03,245 --> 00:16:05,525
Fine. In that case,
I'll just come and watch.

346
00:16:05,805 --> 00:16:07,605
-What?
-You heard me, James.

347
00:16:07,685 --> 00:16:09,485
If you insist on going through with this,

348
00:16:09,565 --> 00:16:11,805
well, I'm-- I'm gonna make sure
you don't enjoy it.

349
00:16:12,885 --> 00:16:14,565
I'm skiving. Say nothing.

350
00:16:15,485 --> 00:16:17,285
Oh, Jenny is a bit of
a head mother, isn't she?

351
00:16:17,365 --> 00:16:18,445
What?

352
00:16:18,525 --> 00:16:20,925
Oh, yeah. Big time.

353
00:16:21,005 --> 00:16:23,085
I've got some beers,
if you fancy a sneaky one.

354
00:16:23,165 --> 00:16:25,125
Just give me one minute.

355
00:16:25,205 --> 00:16:26,805
I just have to-- I'll be right back.

356
00:16:26,885 --> 00:16:30,325
Just stay here. One minute.

357
00:16:32,365 --> 00:16:33,685
-Where's Katya?
-I don't know.

358
00:16:33,765 --> 00:16:35,805
Up there somewhere,
trying to mount my friend.

359
00:16:36,405 --> 00:16:37,365
I owe.

360
00:16:38,125 --> 00:16:40,045
And the plot thickens.

361
00:16:41,245 --> 00:16:42,925
Can you believe him?

362
00:16:43,005 --> 00:16:45,525
Flaunting it in our faces like this.

363
00:16:45,605 --> 00:16:48,085
I don't even know the man anymore.

364
00:16:48,165 --> 00:16:52,165
Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us
sinners now and at the hour of our death.

365
00:16:52,245 --> 00:16:53,885
-[both] Amen.
-Unbelievable.

366
00:16:53,965 --> 00:16:55,165
Jammy Dodger?

367
00:16:55,245 --> 00:16:58,885
[Maeve] Blessed art thou and blessed
is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.

368
00:16:58,965 --> 00:17:00,885
[muffled dance music plays]

369
00:17:05,405 --> 00:17:06,725
James?

370
00:17:10,205 --> 00:17:11,165
James?

371
00:17:12,085 --> 00:17:14,045
Is there any need
for the size of this place?

372
00:17:14,725 --> 00:17:16,565
-James?
-All right?

373
00:17:16,645 --> 00:17:19,205
-What is going on?
-Trying to sort Clive out.

374
00:17:19,285 --> 00:17:22,325
-Clive? Who's Clive?
-Christ.

375
00:17:22,405 --> 00:17:24,165
You dirty, dirty Brit.

376
00:17:24,245 --> 00:17:26,485
-I beg your pardon?
-I know what you're up to.

377
00:17:26,565 --> 00:17:29,325
I'm not up to anything.
I should be up to something,

378
00:17:29,405 --> 00:17:32,125
but I can't find the person
I'm supposed to be up to it with,

379
00:17:32,205 --> 00:17:34,045
because this place
is like a fucking maze.

380
00:17:34,125 --> 00:17:35,325
Shh!

381
00:17:35,405 --> 00:17:37,405
-You'll scare Clive.
-Who's Clive?

382
00:17:37,485 --> 00:17:38,845
Clive.

383
00:17:38,925 --> 00:17:41,045
Clive is a wee Prod from east
Belfast.

384
00:17:41,125 --> 00:17:44,165
Clive came back from Ibiza, got on
the wrong bus at Aldergrove Airport,

385
00:17:44,245 --> 00:17:45,685
then fell asleep.

386
00:17:45,765 --> 00:17:48,645
Clive woke up in Derry,
surrounded by Russians and Fenians.

387
00:17:48,725 --> 00:17:50,485
Clive is absolutely shitting himself.

388
00:17:50,565 --> 00:17:51,925
So where's the real Artem?

389
00:17:52,005 --> 00:17:53,685
Giant's Causeway, probably.

390
00:17:53,765 --> 00:17:56,045
Foreigners fucking love
the Giant's Causeway.

391
00:17:56,125 --> 00:17:59,205
I just wanna go home,
but she won't let me leave.

392
00:17:59,285 --> 00:18:01,485
She won't let me leave.

393
00:18:01,565 --> 00:18:05,485
Um, I also think Clive may have had
too many disco biscuits on his holidays.

394
00:18:06,765 --> 00:18:08,285
Here you are.

395
00:18:08,365 --> 00:18:10,685
-[angelic choir]
-Thank God.

396
00:18:11,765 --> 00:18:14,205
Whatever you do, don't slag off the Pope.

397
00:18:15,285 --> 00:18:16,365
We're outnumbered.

398
00:18:18,125 --> 00:18:20,805
For God's sake, Orla,
you're gonna make yourself boke.

399
00:18:21,525 --> 00:18:22,885
-I can handle it.
-[door opens]

400
00:18:24,325 --> 00:18:26,925
James, what is going on?
I wait long time.

401
00:18:27,005 --> 00:18:28,845
You no longer want to do sex?

402
00:18:28,925 --> 00:18:31,645
No, no, no, I do want to do sex.
I really, really want to do sex.

403
00:18:31,725 --> 00:18:34,805
-Come.
-You disgust me.

404
00:18:35,885 --> 00:18:38,525
-You should be ashamed of yourself.
-Piss off, Erin.

405
00:18:38,605 --> 00:18:40,965
I mean, I know you're desperate, James,
but paying for it?

406
00:18:41,045 --> 00:18:42,205
What?

407
00:18:42,285 --> 00:18:43,965
You really thought I wouldn't work it out?

408
00:18:44,045 --> 00:18:45,845
Work what out?

409
00:18:45,925 --> 00:18:48,805
What the actual cock
are you talking about?

410
00:18:48,885 --> 00:18:50,885
I'm talking about the fact
that she's a prostitute.

411
00:18:50,965 --> 00:18:52,245
-[music ends]
-[all gasp]

412
00:18:53,365 --> 00:18:56,205
[scoffs] I am prostitute?

413
00:18:56,285 --> 00:19:00,005
Oh, come off it, James.
She's charging you for it, isn't she?

414
00:19:00,085 --> 00:19:04,125
-Just admit it.
-No. I mean, I don't think so.

415
00:19:04,205 --> 00:19:06,725
-I mean, not that I wouldn't consider it.
-Ugh!

416
00:19:06,805 --> 00:19:11,725
How dare you? I am poor Ukrainian,
so I must be prostitute.

417
00:19:12,805 --> 00:19:13,885
[Erin] Hear me out.

418
00:19:14,885 --> 00:19:17,165
First, she comes on to James
here.

419
00:19:17,245 --> 00:19:19,205
What would possess her?

420
00:19:19,285 --> 00:19:21,125
Financial gain, that's what.

421
00:19:21,205 --> 00:19:23,925
-He attractive boy, Erin.
-He's English, Katya.

422
00:19:24,005 --> 00:19:26,325
-I have no problem with this.
-You should.

423
00:19:26,405 --> 00:19:28,965
Secondly, she owns condoms.

424
00:19:29,045 --> 00:19:31,685
They're in her bag. A whole packet.

425
00:19:31,765 --> 00:19:33,005
I've seen them, people.

426
00:19:33,085 --> 00:19:34,725
-You are imbecile.
-"An" imbecile.

427
00:19:34,805 --> 00:19:38,725
And thirdly, all night,
wee Ukrainian fellas

428
00:19:38,805 --> 00:19:41,965
have been coming up
and giving her money they "owe" her.

429
00:19:42,045 --> 00:19:44,765
How the hell do you explain that?

430
00:19:45,685 --> 00:19:48,925
I organize, how you say it, whip round.

431
00:19:49,525 --> 00:19:52,845
We like to buy Jenny present
to thank her for nice party.

432
00:19:52,925 --> 00:19:55,365
Oh, you guys.

433
00:19:56,205 --> 00:19:57,725
Right. Okay.

434
00:19:58,405 --> 00:19:59,965
Yeah, that does sort of explain it.

435
00:20:00,045 --> 00:20:01,645
-Dickhead.
-Really, Erin.

436
00:20:01,885 --> 00:20:05,285
So not only you insult me,
but you've also spoiled Jenny's surprise.

437
00:20:08,445 --> 00:20:10,285
I think you should leave.

438
00:20:13,205 --> 00:20:15,245
-Yeah.
-[crowd murmurs]

439
00:20:15,325 --> 00:20:19,645
But great evening all the same, Jenny.
You're a credit to yourself.

440
00:20:30,245 --> 00:20:32,565
Come on, Katya, love.
Let's talk about this, please.

441
00:20:32,645 --> 00:20:34,085
I am finished talking.

442
00:20:34,165 --> 00:20:36,525
She is racist, patronizing bitch.

443
00:20:36,605 --> 00:20:39,125
I am "a" racist, patronizing bitch.

444
00:20:39,205 --> 00:20:41,125
Now, come on, girls. Language, please.

445
00:20:41,205 --> 00:20:44,405
Well, you don't really wanna go
to Jenny Joyce's house, do you, love?

446
00:20:44,485 --> 00:20:45,805
Yes, I do.

447
00:20:46,605 --> 00:20:49,365
Apart from anything, it has eight bedrooms
and a chocolate fountain.

448
00:20:49,445 --> 00:20:51,365
I hope you're happy, Erin.

449
00:20:51,925 --> 00:20:53,925
-You've just done us out of your Russian.
-Ukrainian.

450
00:20:55,205 --> 00:20:56,525
Good for you, Mr. Joe.

451
00:20:56,605 --> 00:20:59,805
She is hot and you're not dead, yet.

452
00:20:59,885 --> 00:21:01,205
Why not have some fun?

453
00:21:11,285 --> 00:21:15,405
Tell me this. Does Jenny Joyce's house
really have eight bedrooms?

454
00:21:15,485 --> 00:21:18,165
Aye. And some of the bedrooms,

455
00:21:18,245 --> 00:21:22,005
they have these wee, tiny bathrooms
attached to them.

456
00:21:22,085 --> 00:21:23,645
Imagine.

457
00:21:28,125 --> 00:21:31,365
Your girls, they're just not ready, Joe.

458
00:21:32,325 --> 00:21:34,245
Maybe see you in mass, then, eh?

459
00:21:34,325 --> 00:21:35,605
Aye.

460
00:21:37,685 --> 00:21:39,445
Here, give me your hand.

461
00:21:41,005 --> 00:21:44,845
Tell Sarah this is the fella
that blow-dries my hair.

462
00:21:45,765 --> 00:21:47,165
He's an artist.

463
00:21:50,445 --> 00:21:51,645

-That Maeve away?
-Aye.

466
00:22:00,445 --> 00:22:03,045
-Nice woman.
-Aye.

467
00:22:03,605 --> 00:22:05,685
Mary and Sarah will come round
eventually, Joe.

468
00:22:05,765 --> 00:22:07,845
It's just hard for them
to see you with somebody else.

469
00:22:07,925 --> 00:22:10,125
As far as they're concerned,
their mother was perfect.

470
00:22:10,845 --> 00:22:12,045
Piss off, Gerry.
