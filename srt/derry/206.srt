<i>The President of the United States,</i>

3
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:31,920
<i>Bill Clinton, a committed supporter</i>
<i>of the peace process,</i>

4
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,080
<i>will visit both sides of the community</i>
<i>during his trip to Belfast,</i>

5
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:36,920
<i>before traveling to Londonderry.</i>

6
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:37,840
[Granda Joe]
He's here!

7
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:40,640
He's here! He's landed!

8
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:41,680
I know he has, Da.

9
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,400
And look at the state of the place.

10
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:45,120
I'd better tell Jim across the road.

11
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,720
Christ, I'm at my wits' end.

12
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,000
Firstly, he's not coming to Derry
until tomorrow.

13
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:50,920
Have you seen the hack
of those skirting boards, Gerry?

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,280
I'd need a week to tackle them.

15
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:54,880
And secondly, I think it's unlikely
he'll call to our house.

16
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,240
He might call, Gerry.

17
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,560
Aye, he might take a notion.

18
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:59,640
I think presidential visits
are quite carefully planned.

19
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:02,400
I'm not sure there's an awful lot
of room for notion-taking.

20
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,800
Hope you're right, Gerry,
for it's like Beirut in here.

21
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:07,160
I mean, when was the last time
these were bleached?

22
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:08,640
I couldn't hand Hillary that.

23
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:11,080
I'd say she keeps
her place shining, Mary.

24
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:12,840
Sure, she'd put you to shame.

25
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:15,320
Right, we need to clear this table.

26
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:16,800
Jim's bringing his equipment over.

27
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:19,640
-What equipment?
-Them old radio transmitters he collects.

28
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:22,640
Him and Daddy think they can
tap into the CIA system on them.

29
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:23,680
Excuse me?

30
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:25,640
Jim really buzzes off radio contact.

31
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:27,240
You cannot tap the CIA, Joe.

32
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:29,200
It'll make tracking Clinton down
much easier.

33
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,840
Right. I don't think the CIA
enjoy people tracking the President down.

34
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:35,080
I think they can get funny
about that type of stuff.

35
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:36,960
Well, let them try and bloody stop me.

36
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:39,280
They will stop you, Joe.
They're the CIA.

37
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:42,000
I won't miss my chance. Not again.

38
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:43,480
You hear me, boy?

39
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,400
What the hell is he planning to do?

40
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:49,080
When JFK came to Dublin,
Uncle Colm met him. Daddy didn't.

41
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:51,000
Things are going to be different
this time, I tell you.

42
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:54,000
JFK spoke to Colm? Christ,
that man didn't have much luck, did he?

43
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,800
I'm not sure any of us
will get to meet Bill or Hillary.

44
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,160
Some sense at last.

45
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,400
They'll be far too busy.

46
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:02,280
That's why we've decided
to take Chelsea off their hands.

47
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:03,160
What?

48
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:05,680
We're going to bring her
to Lisnagelvin swimming pool.

49
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:08,120
-The wave machine's been fixed.
-Lovely.

50
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:10,120
Hope she remembers
her swimming cap, Erin.

51
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:12,640
They've got dead strict
about swimming caps.

52
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,919
And that wain has
some head of hair on her.

53
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,480
Dear Jesus.

54
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:19,160
-Any word from Chelsea?
-Not yet.

55
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,960
We sent that letter over a week ago.

56
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,960
Are you sure you got the address right?

57
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,120
Chelsea Clinton,
the White House, America.

58
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,400
It just doesn't make any sense.

59
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,800
Did you send it first class?

60
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:29,480
We're not made of money, Michelle.

Great stuff altogether.

70
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:00,000
A fitting rendition
of what I consider to be

71
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,360
the most godawful song ever written.

72
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:04,560
Just one announcement today, girls.

73
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,680
I'm sure many of you
will have guessed what it's about.

74
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:10,320
Although tomorrow
is not officially a public holiday,

75
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:13,520
schools across the city
have decided to view it as such

76
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,280
because tomorrow

77
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,680
the President
of the United States of America

78
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:20,720
is coming here, to Derry.

79
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:24,920
You're a little young to perhaps
understand the enormity of this.

80
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,640
A few short months ago,

81
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:29,160
this would have been unimaginable,
but here we are...

82
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:32,960
and I for one can barely believe it.

83
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,560
I mean, people in this place
stop killing each other for five minutes,

84
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:41,120
and the whole world
loses the absolute run of itself.

85
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,520
This visit concerns me
for a number of reasons, girls,

86
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:46,320
but mostly because I am scared
it will give the Pope ideas,

87
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,640
and that's the last thing I need. No.

88
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:52,120
Our Lady Immaculate
will play no part in this farce,

89
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,600
and I expect to see you all here
tomorrow morning, business as usual.

90
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:55,680
Is that clear?

91
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,240
[all murmuring]

92
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,800
Is that clear?

93
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,480
Yes, Sister Michael.

94
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,640
And the Father, Son, Holy Spirit...

95
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:05,960
She can't do this.

96
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:08,880
-She simply cannot do this.
-Well, she's done it, Clare.

97
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:11,600
But it's history.
She's making us miss history.

98
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,920
Ach, but I really wanted to find out

99
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,120
what that Cromwell fella got up to next.

100
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,040
I really enjoy him.

101
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:20,640
Not history class, Orla.

102
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,800
Real history. History being made.

103
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:25,360
And Irish people aren't allowed
to enjoy Oliver Cromwell, Orla.

104
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,360
-Why?
-'Cause he was a fuckin' arsehole.

105
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:30,160
Look, Bill doesn't even get here
till four o'clock tomorrow.

106
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,280
"Bill"? Who are you, his ma?

107
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:34,040
We've got plenty of time,
is all I'm saying.

108
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:36,120
Do you know how packed
that Guildhall Square's gonna be, James?

109
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:38,360
You'd have to camp overnight
just to get a glimpse of him.

110
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:39,880
Chelsea will sort us out.

111
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:42,880
-I'm not sure I trust Chelsea anymore.
-Aye, Chelsea might be flaky.

112
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,320
She does have crafty eyes.

113
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,800
OK, I'm not comfortable
with the Chelsea bashing, girls.

114
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:50,000
This is the biggest thing
that's ever happened here,

115
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,520
that's ever likely to happen here.
We should be part of it.

116
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,960
We will be.

117
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:56,560
Are you suggesting we play truant?

118
00:04:56,640 --> 00:05:00,840
OK, normal people don't call it that,
but yes. Yes, I am.

119
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:02,400
You know what, girls?

120
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,400
Sometimes in order to do the right thing,

121
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:07,080
you have to do the wrong thing,

122
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:11,840
and on this occasion,
right is wrong and wrong is right.

123
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,680
What the fuck are you on about?

124
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:16,120
Are you going to sack off school or not?

125
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,720
Let's do it.

126
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,640
[Dennis]
That'll be £1.99.

127
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,000
Right.

128
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,200
Is there some sort of
a problem here, girls?

129
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:31,520
Not a problem, as such.
More of a-a-a question, really.

130
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,520
You think I'm here
to answer questions, do you?

131
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,280
Who am I,
Magnus fucking Magnusson?

132
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,160
He doesn't answer questions,
he asks them.

133
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,040
Pipe the fuck down.

134
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:40,640
It's just it's pink, white and purple,
Dennis.

135
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:43,160
-So?
-Well, it should be red, white and blue.

136
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:45,440
-Says who?
-The rest of the world.

137
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:48,040
There's also quite a few stars missing.

138
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:50,320
-No, there's not.
-There's only 30 stars here.

139
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,520
There should be 50, because
the stars represent the states, so--

140
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,520
-Some of them left.
-Some states left!

141
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,360
-That's right.
-Some states left America.

142
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,200
-Yep.
-When did this happen?

143
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,080
The other day.

144
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,560
God, that's desperate.

145
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:02,640
I don't know,

146
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:05,400
I just feel like
if 20 states left the USA,

147
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:07,000
we might have heard about it.

148
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:09,280
They didn't want to
make it into a big thing.

149
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:12,400
So, these are the new, modern,
up-to-date flags.

150
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:14,440
They've just brought them out.

151
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:16,600
OK. It's just,

152
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:19,200
well, I'm not convinced
that's actually true.

153
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,320
Well, why would I lie?

154
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,000
Because you bought
a fuckload of dud flags,

155
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,280
and you're trying to get rid of them.

156
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,840
Get out!

157
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:28,440
What first attracted him
to a career in retail, do you think?

158
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,320
[brakes squeak, grind]

159
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:32,920
Hello there.

160
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,480
Why don't you hop in?

161
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:38,160
Oh, come on now. Don't be shy.

162
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:41,680
Help! Stranger! Stranger danger!

163
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:42,760
Jesus Christ, Erin.

164
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:45,400
Help! This woman
is trying to abduct us!

165
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,880
Help! Fire! There's a fire!

166
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:49,800
Fire? What the fuck are you on about?

167
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:51,600
It gets more attention.
I read it somewhere.

168
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,280
-Kidnapper!
-Help! Fire!

169
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,840
Help! There's a kidnapper on fire!

170
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:58,160
Will yous all just shut the fuck up?
It's fine.

171
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,360
She's not a kidnapper.

172
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:00,760
Well, who is she?

173
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,160
My Aunt Cathy.

174
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:05,480
Hello, Mum.

175
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,560
[radio static, indistinct chatter]

176
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,160

00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,960
[TV reporter]
<i>The Prime Minister said</i>

178
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:22,120
<i>that it quite clearly helped to revive...</i>

179
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,160
What exactly is the plan over there?

180
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:27,280
They're trying to discover
the location of the presidential basecamp.

181
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,120
Does that mean
which hotel he's staying in?

182
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,600
I think so, aye.

183
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,600
What kept you two?

184
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:34,800
We have some serious scandal,
Mammy.

185
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:37,280
I'm not interested in any of
your old schoolgirl gossip, Erin.

186
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,160
I am.

187
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,520
We just met James' mammy.

188
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:42,200
Cathy Maguire's back? Really?

189
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:43,760
She tried to set us on fire.

190
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,480
-She did what?!
-She didn't.

191
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:47,280
Jesus, but she's no shame.

192
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:50,040
Tell me this, wains.
How were the eyebrows?

193
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,720
-[Erin] What do you mean?
-The eyebrows.

194
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,160
Were they looking well?

195
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:55,040
I didn't really notice her eyebrows.

196
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:58,680
Cathy Maguire had the best eyebrows
in Derry back in her day.

197
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:00,680
She could have given Joan Crawford
a run for her money.

198
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:01,760
Isn't that right, Mary?

199
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,680
I've no time for Cathy Maguire.

200
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,840
The woman abandoned
her own wain, Sarah.

201
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,840
She always was one cold,
self-serving, wee madam.

202
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:12,120
I'm not talking about her.
I'm talking about her eyebrows.

203
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:15,640
Cathy and her eyebrows
are two separate entities.

204
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,040
All right, don't be gettin' worked up.

205
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:20,160
I just think you should be able
to compliment a woman's eyebrows

206
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,440
without having her personality
dragged into it.

207
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:24,920
-[doorbell]
-Fine, her eyebrows were exceptional.

208
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,440
Thank you.

209
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,000
[Erin yelling]
It's Uncle Colm!

210
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,000
Dear God, no.

211
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:31,120
Everything all right, Colm?

212
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,160
Oh, God, aye.

213
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:35,080
Well, the old knee's giving me
a bit of jip,

214
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:37,159
but sure, I'll not bore you
with the details.

215
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,120
I doubt that.

216
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:41,400
I felt a twinge there this morning,
and I says to myself, says I,

217
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:43,880
"Colm, you'll need to get that seen to.

218
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,960
You can't let that go," for--

219
00:08:46,039 --> 00:08:47,840
and you'll maybe
not remember this, girls,

220
00:08:47,919 --> 00:08:51,520
but Maggie Murphy felt a twinge
on a Monday,

221
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,520
and on the Thursday
of the very same week,

222
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,760
sure didn't she drop dead at the bingo?

223
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:59,120
And her sitting on a full house, too.

224
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,320
But sure, you can't take it with you,
as they say.

225
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,800
God rest her soul.

226
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:05,800
Is there something we can do for you,
Colm?

227
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:08,920
Oh, I just called round
to help with this CIA business.

228
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,520
Who told you about that?

229
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,520
[clears throat]
I did, Joe.

230
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,920
Why?

231
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,920
Look, Colm's met JFK.

232
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,920
He has experience with presidents.
He'll know what to do.

233
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
No chance.

234
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:23,240
I'm sorry, Colm,
but you can't be part of this.

235
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:25,600
If you meet Bill Clinton,
you'll be a president up.

236
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,360
You'll have two presidents to my one.

237
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,440
I can't have you getting ahead of me,
president-wise.

238
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:31,840
One of his presidents is dead.

239
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,440
-It still counts.
-Ssh!

240
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:35,120
I'll have to even things up again.

241
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,000
[Jim]
Ssh, Joe.

242
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,720
I can't spend the rest of my life
traipsing about after bloody presidents.

243
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,120
I've other things to be at, girls.

244
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,080
Shut up, Joe.

245
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:43,200
What the blazes is wrong with you?
Mouth!

246
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:44,920
I think I've got something.

247
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:47,040
Don't toy with me now, Jim.

248
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,440
[garbled voices on radio, static]

249
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:56,000
Aye, it was a CIA agent, all right.

250
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:58,320
He said they're taking Bill back to base,

251
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,920
and I know where it is.

252
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,560
We need to move quickly.

253
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:03,200
-You still OK to drive us?
-What?

254
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:06,360
We need someone to stay in the car,
in case things don't go to plan.

255
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,880
So, a getaway driver, essentially.

256
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,880
We're talking worst-case scenario.

257
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:13,080
We're talking no-case scenario!

258
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,200
[Gerry]
Just doesn't make any sense, Jim.

259
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:23,440
I heard him say it.
As clear as day it was.

260
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:25,680
Burt. Why would they bring him to Burt?

261
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,680
Well, that's what's so clever about it.

262
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:28,880
Nobody's gonna go looking

263
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:31,360
for the President of the U.S.A.
in Burt now, are they?

264
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,760
If you went about saying
Bill Clinton was in Burt,

265
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,680
people would think you were clean mad.

266
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,040
Precisely.

267
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,520
Look, lads, if you want my opinion--

268
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,880
-We don't.
-Grand.

269
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:43,720
This Clinton boyo is actually
America's 42nd president,

270
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:48,440
which is interesting, now,
because JFK, well, he was the 35th.

271
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:50,080
Why is that interesting?

272
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,040
Well, it's not really, I suppose.

273
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:55,520
Sometimes I'll just say something to get
me from one sentence to the other, Joe.

274
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,600
You know how it is.

275
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:58,480
Shall we just stop here on the left?

276
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:01,640
I'm not sure what number Nixon was now,

277
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:05,000
or your man-- what you call him?--
the beardy fella in the hat,

278
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:07,280
the one that knocked the old slavery
on the head.

279
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:09,040
-Lincoln.
-The very boy.

280
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,040
But then, there was the 27th...

281
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,200
...America's 30th,

282
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:16,520
and then there was the lad
they named all the vacuum cleaners after.

283
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:19,040
Jesus wept. How much further, Jim?

284
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,120

And Kennedy, of course, the poor critter.

00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:29,280
How?

Hands on him like shovels.

Stop listing presidents, Colm!

Not a dickybird, Mammy.

It's her loss. That wave machine
is absolutely cracker.

the day off, that's something.

-It is indeed.

You've kept them eyebrows
shipshape, so you have.

-Ach, you're too kind, Sarah.

Nightmare.

333
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:09,800
Yeah, it was a difficult decision,
but Paul, my ex, well,

334
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:11,480
he just became so controlling.

335
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:12,600
Jesus. Really?

336
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:14,360
He was unbearable towards the end.

337
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:17,280
It was always, "Oh, Cathy,
why did you stay out all night?"

338
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:20,240
or "Who was that man
you were having dinner with, Cathy?"

339
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,800
He was very insecure.

340
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:23,520
Wonder why.

341
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,600
