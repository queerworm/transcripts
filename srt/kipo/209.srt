00:00:23,648 --> 00:00:26,067
So, it was Dr. Emilia the whole time?

4
00:00:26,151 --> 00:00:28,611
If she rescues the people
from the burrow--

5
00:00:28,695 --> 00:00:32,198
She'll turn everyone into
mute-hating weirdos, just like her.

6
00:00:32,282 --> 00:00:35,160
Mm-mm-mm.
I knew I didn't like her.

7
00:00:35,243 --> 00:00:38,663
I saw the twisted soul that lives
beneath the surface, and I said,

8
00:00:38,747 --> 00:00:41,124
"Benson, that is an evil woman."

9
00:00:41,207 --> 00:00:43,418
Dave! That did not happen.
Quit lying.

10
00:00:43,501 --> 00:00:45,378
OK, guys, I don't have much time.

11
00:00:45,462 --> 00:00:48,381
You go stop Dr. Emilia
from getting to the coronation.

12
00:00:48,465 --> 00:00:52,677
-By any means necessary.
-Oh, you mean fight dirty.

13
00:00:52,761 --> 00:00:54,512
Yeah, we can do that.

14
00:00:55,263 --> 00:00:57,182
Dave, always with the rocks.

15
00:00:57,265 --> 00:00:59,100
We're not throwing rocks at Dr. Emilia.

16
00:00:59,184 --> 00:01:00,393
Kipo, aren't you coming?

17
00:01:00,477 --> 00:01:03,063
Well, Scarlemagne's
kind of opened up to me.

18
00:01:03,146 --> 00:01:06,566
I mean, he really told me
a lot of personal stuff and--

19
00:01:06,649 --> 00:01:08,777
Oh, you're gonna stay here
and exploit his weaknesses

20
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:10,070
for when you have to fight him.

21
00:01:10,945 --> 00:01:12,822
Yep, you guessed it.

22
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:14,574
Here. You take these.

00:01:21,706 --> 00:01:24,793
Hey, Scarlemagne wants you
to join him in the food court.

27
00:01:25,001 --> 00:01:26,461
He said, and I quote,

28
00:01:26,795 --> 00:01:29,422
"No one goes to the bathroom
for that long."

29
00:01:29,506 --> 00:01:32,258
Have you ever tried
to go in one of these dresses?

30
00:01:32,342 --> 00:01:34,010
It takes a long time.

-Again.
-Hi, Emilia. Good to see you.

33
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:07,418
You still sound like you want to kill her.

34
00:02:07,502 --> 00:02:08,878
Hi, Emilia!

35
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:12,882
You want to kill my best friend,
and I'm OK with that.

36
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:14,134
Mm, better.

37
00:02:14,217 --> 00:02:17,387
Look, Wolfie, all you gotta do
is play nice until we get Mandu,

38
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:19,848
then use this baby
to blow up the tunnel in the morning

39
00:02:19,931 --> 00:02:22,350
so she can't follow us
to Scarlemagne's palace!

40
00:02:22,433 --> 00:02:25,145
You can do it.
And if you don't, we are doomed!

41
00:02:25,478 --> 00:02:27,814
If we do that,
then what do we give to Emilia?

42
00:02:27,897 --> 00:02:30,275
That's why I swiped this perfume bottle.

43
00:02:30,358 --> 00:02:32,652
Oh, that looks just like this nectar bomb.

44
00:02:32,735 --> 00:02:34,696
I know, Dave.
That's the point.

45
00:02:34,779 --> 00:02:36,197
Right, right.

46
00:02:37,323 --> 00:02:39,367
Come on.
And, again.

[Wolf groans]

48
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:44,080
Hi, Emilia.
How's it going?

-She was... she was right here.

53

Do you really expect me to believe
you don't know where she is?

54
00:02:57,927 --> 00:03:00,722
I don't care what you believe.
It's your fault she's gone.

55
00:03:00,805 --> 00:03:01,639
My fault?!

56
00:03:01,723 --> 00:03:04,559
You told her she has to fight
the Mega Monkey.

57
00:03:04,642 --> 00:03:07,395
-Do you know how scary that is?
-Poor Kipo!

58
00:03:07,478 --> 00:03:10,565
Carrying the weight of the world
on her 13-year-old shoulders.

59
00:03:10,648 --> 00:03:12,066
No wonder she ran off.

60
00:03:13,568 --> 00:03:15,904
If anything happens to my best friend--

61
00:03:15,987 --> 00:03:17,697
[exhales]
We're leaving.

62
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:19,699
First thing in the morning,
with or without her.

63
00:03:19,782 --> 00:03:21,910
I will not abandon all those humans.

64
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:26,122
-Now, give me the nectar bomb.
-Oh, right, the bomb.

-It's fine, Mandu.

They're back, but Kipo's gone.

00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:44,224
Something's up.

70
00:03:44,307 --> 00:03:46,643
Do you think they found out
we're using them

71
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:48,937
and planning on killing Kipo
when we're done?

72
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:50,021
Unclear.

73
00:03:50,104 --> 00:03:52,148
But saying that out loud
doesn't help, Greta.

74
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:55,068
[groans] We might have to go back
to our original plan.

75
00:03:55,818 --> 00:03:58,571
One of us has to use
the sonic emitter on the Mega Monkey.

76
00:03:59,822 --> 00:04:03,243
As long as we have her friends,
we can get Kipo back.

77
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:07,538
A valiant effort, Kipo,
but you're too late.

78
00:04:07,622 --> 00:04:13,628
I will become Corn Dog King!

While you were sacrificing your army
to burn my corn fields,

81
00:04:20,385 --> 00:04:21,886
I snuck into your farm...

82
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:26,933
and started a revolt with the farmers.

83
00:04:27,016 --> 00:04:29,769
So, actually, I win!

Oh, um, just wanted
to blow off some steam.

And if I catch you yawning
at my coronation,

100

I will drop you from the sky!

00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:16,107
Now, get some rest.

Have you ever maybe
thought about not doing that?

No, I mean the whole coronation thing.

everyone over for a party?

All he wanted was a hug
and his stupid star blanket.

Time to go. No more pancakes, Greta!

179
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:24,146
But there are more pancakes.

180
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:26,607
-Do you want some?
-They're made with love.

181
00:09:26,691 --> 00:09:28,901
And real fake butter spray.

That was incredible!

What is the meaning of this?!

195
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,153
Why are you out of your cage?!

196
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:58,532
I know this looks bad, but I broke
my dad out to come talk to you.

197
00:10:59,116 --> 00:11:01,535
Lio, you tell me.

199
00:11:03,412 --> 00:11:05,623
And don't hold back the truth.

200
00:11:06,248 --> 00:11:07,792
We were coming to see you.

201
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:11,087
I didn't think it was a good idea,
but she really believes in you.

202
00:11:11,462 --> 00:11:13,631
And then these frogs attacked us.

203
00:11:13,714 --> 00:11:17,218
But she beat them... easily.
It wasn't even a fight.

-My daughter is amazing.
-Aw, Dad.

205
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:23,432
She can do anything.

-About what?
-About how I gave up on you.

207
00:11:27,311 --> 00:11:30,856
I shouldn't have.
I'm sorry it took Kipo to point it out.

My, my.
You're just full of surprises, Kipo.

209
00:11:35,736 --> 00:11:37,488
Now, come along.

You know, if you were
like this with everyone,

238
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:19,715
instead of forcing them to follow you,
they might choose to.

239
00:13:19,798 --> 00:13:22,218
[scoffs]
No one wants to be ruled.

240
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:23,969
Why would they choose that?

241
00:13:24,053 --> 00:13:26,639
Because they like you.

242
00:13:26,722 --> 00:13:28,766
That would never happen.

I made you something.

I know it's not the one you lost,
but I thought...

246
00:13:39,401 --> 00:13:43,614
Well, I wanted to say I'm sorry
for everything that happened

247
00:13:43,697 --> 00:13:45,533
and for my part in hurting you.

248

You weren't the one who rejected me.

Please, just promise me
you'll think about what I said?

Stop yelling each other's names
before you attack.

might actually be a challenge.

00:20:41,448 --> 00:20:43,492
[breathing heavily]

351
00:20:44,534 --> 00:20:46,912
You look upset.
But I did what you asked.

352
00:20:46,995 --> 00:20:49,915
-I'm giving them a choice.
-What kind of choice is that?

353
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:56,046
Let me try again.
This time, I'll give you the choice.

354
00:20:56,129 --> 00:20:57,881
I'll let everyone go.

355
00:20:57,965 --> 00:21:00,384
Only those who
want to follow me will stay.

356
00:21:00,467 --> 00:21:04,638
I will give up everything
I've worked for, for you.

357
00:21:04,721 --> 00:21:07,766
But I need to know that you're willing
to give something up for me.

358
00:21:07,849 --> 00:21:09,268
OK, anything.

359
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:11,728
Gild your father.

360
00:21:14,564 --> 00:21:15,691
What?!

361
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:17,776
No, I won't hurt my dad.

362
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:19,695
I see.

363
00:21:19,778 --> 00:21:21,655
No one ever chooses me...

364
00:21:23,824 --> 00:21:25,492
unless I make them.

365
00:21:25,575 --> 00:21:28,245
[crowd chanting]
Scarlemagne! Scarlemagne!

366
00:21:28,328 --> 00:21:30,747
[crowd cheering]

367
00:21:31,748 --> 00:21:35,294
All hail Emperor Scarlemagne!

368
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:41,216
[crowd chanting]
Scarlemagne! Scarlemagne! Scarlemagne!

369
00:21:42,175 --> 00:21:43,885
[music playing]
