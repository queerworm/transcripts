It must be so tough for you,

knowing your daughter
is growing up without you.

9
00:00:41,166 --> 00:00:46,171
She must be just about to turn 13, right?

10
00:00:46,254 --> 00:00:50,592
Well, I've got good news.
I've found her.

-Turns out she's been living in a burrow

00:00:57,015 --> 00:00:59,476

But sadly, she's a monster.

21
00:01:19,412 --> 00:01:21,372
Go and put her out of her misery.

00:02:16,928 --> 00:02:18,888

The legend of Yumyan Hammerpaw
will live on for generations.

while you were talking about him!

is totally not cool.

-I don't wanna be small!
-Oh, I'm sorry.

54

That's what you're worried about?
Losing your gains.

He can't talk!

-It's the "cure."

Oh, right, uh,
you can't hug my finger anymore

102
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:03,738
because it's not giant.

103
00:06:03,821 --> 00:06:05,907

That's OK.

104
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:08,409
We-we'll come up with
a new Kipo and Mom thing.

105
00:06:08,493 --> 00:06:11,496
It'll be so much... dah!
You have my nose.

00:06:11,579 --> 00:06:15,083
Or-or, I guess I have yours.
This is so cool!

-I could stare at you all day!
-Right back at ya!

I don't know where to begin.
I've missed so much.

109
00:06:21,714 --> 00:06:24,509
It's OK. We've got
the rest of our lives to catch up.

110
00:06:26,511 --> 00:06:29,013
Wait.
This means Emilia has the cure.

111
00:06:29,847 --> 00:06:32,892
Yes, and we're going to need your help
to make a vaccine.

112
00:06:32,975 --> 00:06:35,144
But first, let's just enjoy this.

113
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:37,105
I know Emilia.
There's no time.

114
00:06:37,188 --> 00:06:39,565
She'll be on her way.
We have to get started.

115
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:41,859

if you brought me that Wolf girl.

00:06:54,497 --> 00:06:56,457
I always keep my promise.

121
00:07:01,212 --> 00:07:03,422
Watch this.

122
00:07:06,717 --> 00:07:11,139
I-I can't remember if the mutagen
was heterozygous or homozygous.

123
00:07:11,222 --> 00:07:14,183
-Uh, heterozygous?
-Right, yes.

124
00:07:14,642 --> 00:07:18,020
[exhales] Now I can't remember
the pattern of the dominant alleles!

125
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:20,982
Song, it's OK.
It's been a while since you've done this.

126
00:07:21,065 --> 00:07:22,984
Lio, she's counting on me.

127
00:07:24,527 --> 00:07:25,987
You're doing great, Mom!

128
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:28,156
Thanks, honey, except, I'm not.

129
00:07:28,239 --> 00:07:30,450
It's just... it's just been so long.

130
00:07:30,533 --> 00:07:32,743
It's OK!
You'll get it.

131
00:07:32,827 --> 00:07:34,162
Mom! Mom!

132
00:07:34,245 --> 00:07:35,872
[both chanting]
Mom! Mom!

133
00:07:36,747 --> 00:07:38,708
Mom! [clapping] Mom!

134
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:41,419
This is everything I imagined
having a mom would be!

135
00:07:41,502 --> 00:07:43,379
Cheering for her while she does science?

136
00:07:43,921 --> 00:07:45,423
-Yeah, that tracks.
-Whoo!

137
00:07:45,506 --> 00:07:47,008
OK. OK.

138
00:07:47,091 --> 00:07:52,054
I remember trying to prolong the process
of transient polymorphism, and then...

139
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:53,764
[grunts]
Nothing!

140
00:08:00,396 --> 00:08:01,939
That's OK.
We'll get there.

141
00:08:02,023 --> 00:08:05,610
Not in time to stop Dr. Emilia
from "curing" half the surface.

142
00:08:05,693 --> 00:08:10,198
Kipo, I'm sorry.
It's not coming back to me fast enough.

143
00:08:13,576 --> 00:08:15,786
-If Song can't make a vaccine...
-[all chattering]

144
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:18,164
What are we gonna do?

145
00:08:18,247 --> 00:08:21,209
-All is lost!
-It's not!

146
00:08:21,292 --> 00:08:23,419
My mom will figure out the vaccine.

147
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:27,381
But we basically asked her
to save the world in one afternoon.

148
00:08:27,465 --> 00:08:30,301
-Which was nuts.
-It wouldn't have been for the old me.

149
00:08:30,384 --> 00:08:33,554
But don't worry, I'm sure she'll
figure out the vaccine in a few days.

150
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:36,933
It's Emilia.
We saw her army by the old headquarters.

151
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:39,852
She's on her way.
Side note, we'll be joining HMUFA.

152
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:43,272
OK, so we only have one day.

153
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:44,232
We need to find another way

154
00:08:44,315 --> 00:08:46,734
to defend ourselves from Dr. Emilia
in the meantime.

155
00:08:46,817 --> 00:08:49,987
-We'll sharpen our axes.
-Our fangs are always sharp!

156
00:08:50,071 --> 00:08:51,989
I will throw weights at them!

157
00:08:52,073 --> 00:08:53,824
Love the enthusiasm, but--

158
00:08:53,908 --> 00:08:55,952
None of that will work against cure darts.

159
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:57,161
Ooh! Ooh!
I know!

160
00:08:57,245 --> 00:08:59,330
We can get the skunks
to put up a wall of stink.

161
00:08:59,413 --> 00:09:00,331
Humans will be like,

162
00:09:00,414 --> 00:09:03,125
"Ew, I'm not walking
through that, Johnny."

163
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:05,002
-And leave us alone.
-That's a great idea.

164
00:09:05,086 --> 00:09:07,421
-[both] It is?
-Not the skunk part, but the wall!

165
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:11,884
A wall that big would take all
the timber in Timbercat Village.

166
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:13,678
Then, what are we even protecting?

167
00:09:13,761 --> 00:09:17,056
OK, we'll build it with something else.
What would scare the humans?

168
00:09:17,139 --> 00:09:18,391
-[Benson] Clowns?
-[mute 1] Other humans!

169
00:09:18,474 --> 00:09:19,642
-[mute 2] Diversity!
-[mute 3] Public speaking!

170
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:21,143
-[mute 4] Great big cockroach!
-[mute 5] Their past!

171
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:23,187
[mute 6] A Mega Monkey!
Oh... Never mind.

172
00:09:23,271 --> 00:09:25,106
-Death Ivy!
-Yes!

173
00:09:25,189 --> 00:09:27,733
Thank you, Benson,
for having a usable idea.

174
00:09:27,817 --> 00:09:29,944
I also said clowns, but I got there.

175
00:09:30,027 --> 00:09:32,613
[chuckles]
Yeah, great plan... small problem.

176
00:09:32,697 --> 00:09:35,783
No one can touch death ivy without,
you know, dying to death.

177
00:09:36,367 --> 00:09:37,910
Dubstep Bees!

178
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:39,704
Fun fact: they're immune to it.

179
00:09:39,787 --> 00:09:41,497
Fun follow-up: I don't know why.

180
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:44,125
Then I guess we're asking
the bees to join HMUFA!

181
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:45,626
They can build a wall of death ivy

182
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:49,005
to keep the humans out long enough
for my mom to make the vaccine.

183
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:50,298
Ahem.

184
00:09:50,381 --> 00:09:53,301
Great idea, Kipo.
Yumyan would be proud.

185
00:09:53,384 --> 00:09:56,345
-Hey, where is Yumyan?
-Oh, we put him in the kitchen.

186
00:09:56,429 --> 00:10:00,016
The kitchen
with the giant hole in the wall?

187
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:01,309
[all gasping]

188
00:10:01,392 --> 00:10:02,310
Oh, no.

189
00:10:02,393 --> 00:10:04,562
He could be on top of something,
underneath something,

190
00:10:04,645 --> 00:10:07,940
inside of something,
and that something could be anything!

191
00:10:08,024 --> 00:10:09,400
Don't worry, Molly.

192
00:10:09,483 --> 00:10:12,570
We're gonna find him
and whoever's responsible for losing him.

193
00:10:12,653 --> 00:10:15,448
-Dave, it was us.
-So, we're halfway there.

194
00:10:15,531 --> 00:10:19,160
All right, you guys go find Yumyan,
Wolf and I will convince the bees to help.

195
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:22,705
My mom seems so upset.

196
00:10:22,788 --> 00:10:24,957
I wish there was something
I could do to make her feel better.

197
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:28,252
[groans] I wish I could make
the vaccine faster.

198
00:10:28,336 --> 00:10:29,879
I feel like I'm failing her.

199
00:10:29,962 --> 00:10:31,922
[sighs]
I feel like that all the time.

200
00:10:32,006 --> 00:10:33,633
But I promise you,
she doesn't feel that way.

201
00:10:33,716 --> 00:10:35,760
Maybe you just need a break,
recharge your batteries.

202
00:10:36,427 --> 00:10:38,012
Hey, we could tag along with Kipo!

203
00:10:38,095 --> 00:10:40,806
Then you can show her
who the coolest mom in the world is.

204
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:41,807
It's you.

205
00:10:42,266 --> 00:10:43,726
Hey, why don't we invite her?

206
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:46,646
[gasps] Then we can save everyone together
and make special memories.

207
00:10:46,729 --> 00:10:49,690
-[gasps] Wolf, you're a genius.
-Yeah...

208
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:52,151
-Hey, Mom...
-Kipo...

209
00:10:52,568 --> 00:10:53,944
-Do you want to come with us?
-Can we come with you?

210
00:10:54,028 --> 00:10:56,155
Song, do you want to help us find a cat?

211
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:57,406
Yes!

212
00:10:57,823 --> 00:11:00,701
So, was that yes to me or to Kipo?

213
00:11:00,785 --> 00:11:02,411
[snoring]

214
00:11:03,037 --> 00:11:04,288
[whisper sounds]

215
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:05,247
[Benson] Yumyan!

-[whisper sounds]

217
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:08,709
Mandu, have you seen Yumyan?

218
00:11:09,251 --> 00:11:10,419
[snorts]

219
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:11,712

00:11:15,466 --> 00:11:18,052
-Ming ming ming.
-Ming ming ming?

222
00:11:18,135 --> 00:11:20,012
Cats love this, trust me.

223
00:11:20,096 --> 00:11:21,597
Ming ming ming!

224
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:22,765
[footsteps]

225
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:25,142
What is that enticing noise?

[all meowing]

227
00:11:26,894 --> 00:11:29,271
Well, it worked on
every cat besides Yumyan.

228
00:11:29,688 --> 00:11:30,523
[meows]

229
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:33,067
[Kipo] OK! OK! [gasps]

230
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:35,569
On the count of three,
what's your favorite cake.

231
00:11:35,653 --> 00:11:37,196
One, two, three...

232
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:39,907
[both] Chocolate cake, peanut butter
frosting with chocolate chunks!

233
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:42,743
Our turn, Wolf.
One, two, three...

234
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:44,787
-Vanilla!
-I've never had cake, what is cake?

235
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:45,788
[motorbike approaching]

236
00:11:53,087 --> 00:11:56,298
This highway belongs
to the Scooter Skunks, humans.

237
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:58,717
If you wanna cross, you gotta race.

238
00:11:58,801 --> 00:12:01,470
We don't want any trouble.
We just need to get to the Dubstep Bees.

239
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:04,098
[whispering]
Lio, this is my chance.

240
00:12:04,181 --> 00:12:05,057
I'll do it!

241
00:12:05,683 --> 00:12:09,478
Get a good look at my face because from
now on, I'll be so far ahead of you,

242
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:11,397
you're only gonna see my back.

243
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:14,859
-Until we shake hands at the finish line.
-We'll see about that.

244
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:17,820
[engine revs]

245
00:12:17,903 --> 00:12:21,031
Dah! My mom is so cool!
Ka-click.

246
00:12:21,115 --> 00:12:23,617
Oh, that was me taking pictures
with my mind camera!

247
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:24,577
Memories being made!

00:12:27,329 --> 00:12:29,915
Ready, steady, go!

That's hilarious.

-Wait, you're the jaguar girl?
-[growls]

256
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:52,021
We didn't recognize you
without the fur and giant teeth!

257
00:12:52,104 --> 00:12:54,690
-You humans look the same!
-[roars]

259
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:01,489
Mom, are you OK?

260
00:13:01,572 --> 00:13:03,407
I thought you knew how to ride.

261
00:13:03,491 --> 00:13:06,076
Yeah, I thought it would be
like riding a bike.

262
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,621
-Which I also don't know how to do.
-You had me fooled.

263
00:13:08,704 --> 00:13:10,080
I thought this was
gonna be one of those

264
00:13:10,164 --> 00:13:12,249
"we learn something new
about each other every day" moments.

265
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:15,294
I think it's brave you tried.
I can't ride a motorcycle.

266
00:13:15,377 --> 00:13:18,130
Ooh! Maybe we could learn together
and that could be our thing!

267
00:13:18,214 --> 00:13:20,966
-[clears throat]
-Right, the mission!

268
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:22,092
We got places to be.

269
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:30,768
-[Benson] Yumyan!
-[Dave] Yumyan!

270
00:13:30,851 --> 00:13:33,437
Do you really think Yumyan
could have gotten this far?

271
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:34,855
Absolutely, yes.

272
00:13:34,939 --> 00:13:36,440
-[squeaks]
-Oh, no!

273
00:13:36,524 --> 00:13:39,985
[gasps]
Did you just step on a bug?

274
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:42,279
Maybe it was a crunchy leaf?
[nervous chuckle]

275
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:45,115
Nope. That was a bug.

276
00:13:45,366 --> 00:13:48,160
Dave, I-I-I'm so sorry,
I didn't mean to...

277
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:50,704
-How could you?
-It was an accident.

278
00:13:50,788 --> 00:13:51,664
-I-I--
-Bup-bup!

279
00:13:51,747 --> 00:13:53,832
There's only one way to make up for this.

280
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:58,796
We're gonna have to find a small,
tiny human to squish.

281
00:13:59,088 --> 00:14:01,131
[gasps] Li... like a baby?

282
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:03,676
That... that's a baby, Dave!

283
00:14:04,969 --> 00:14:06,095
Yes.

284
00:14:06,178 --> 00:14:07,972
I-- I'm not gonna go step on a baby, now.

285
00:14:08,055 --> 00:14:10,891
-That's... that makes it worse!
-How do you know that bug wasn't a baby?

286
00:14:11,725 --> 00:14:13,227
Any luck finding Yumyan?

287
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:15,688
Oh, right, we were looking for a cat.
[laughs]

288
00:14:15,771 --> 00:14:18,941
I was having so much fun
messing with Benson, I completely forgot.

289
00:14:19,775 --> 00:14:22,528
Oh, look, another bug!
I'm gonna squish it!

-[laughing] Yeah!

00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:30,035
OK, dealing with the Dubstep Bees
can be tricky.

294
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:32,371
-I can talk to them.
-Are you sure?

295
00:14:32,454 --> 00:14:34,415
I don't want you to get hurt again,
like with the bike.

296
00:14:34,498 --> 00:14:36,834
Yes, I can definitely do this for you.

297
00:14:36,917 --> 00:14:39,044
I learned a few things
from my time as a Mega Monkey.

298
00:14:43,257 --> 00:14:44,884

Kipo, this is no time to dance.

What's happening to me?

315
00:15:34,016 --> 00:15:36,727
I read in an ancient text
called<i> Cat Sassy,</i>

316
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:39,355
that cats can't resist
getting into boxes.

317
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:41,315
That's completely ridiculous.

318
00:15:41,398 --> 00:15:42,232
Hmm?

Well, we tried everything.

323
00:15:51,241 --> 00:15:54,203
Maybe we can find them a new cat
and they won't even notice.

324
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:59,750
Uh, why am I suddenly,
and uncontrollably, good at dancing?

325
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:01,835
The queen's sting
causes dance fever, honey.

326
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:03,128
You're gonna be OK.

327
00:16:03,212 --> 00:16:04,296
She's not gonna be OK.

328
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:06,340
If we don't do something,
she'll dance until she dies.

Sorry!

I thought that would work,
based on nothing.

to get her out of this!
