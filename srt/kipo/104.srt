Dad, did you know the Milky Way
is the reason we have the word galaxy?

3
00:00:24,107 --> 00:00:26,484
The ancient Greeks looked up,
they saw a milky thing in the sky,

00:00:26,568 --> 00:00:28,111
and they called it<i> galactos.</i>

5
00:00:28,194 --> 00:00:31,114
[laughs]
I did. I wrote that book.

00:00:31,197 --> 00:00:33,074
Oh. Eh, it's all right.

7
00:00:33,158 --> 00:00:36,286
Well, the blurb on the back calls it,
"brilliant and insightful."

So, heyo!

that we'll never get to see all that?

Do you remember voting on this plan?
Because I don't!

43
00:02:55,049 --> 00:02:58,636
Soon we will find the Mega Beast,
crush it,

Friends are your friends,

That jacket is all spiky.

62

Do you think it would make me look
more intimidating to the Mega Mute?

-No.
-But I need something that says...

Hey, you! Give me back my dad.

Do you really think
you can just talk to a Mega Mute?

66
00:03:58,112 --> 00:04:01,658
They can't think.
They're mindless giants.

There weren't any human footprints
leading out of my burrow.

So, either that Mega Mute took them,

71
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:15,171
or a city full of humans
just disappeared into thin air.

72
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:16,422
Or it ate them.

00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:05,503
You know how much venom
I've got coursing through my veins?

177
00:09:06,254 --> 00:09:07,505
[grunting]

178
00:09:07,588 --> 00:09:08,673
Tingly.

179
00:09:08,756 --> 00:09:11,592
I haven't felt this good
since my 21st shedding.

180
00:09:11,676 --> 00:09:13,302
[grunting]

181
00:09:14,095 --> 00:09:15,054

[snorting]

183
00:09:16,681 --> 00:09:19,809
I know. Wolf said to stay put
no matter what happens, but--

184
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:21,310
-[grunts]
-[snake] OK, fun's over.

185
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:24,772
-[screams]
-Hey! Hey, Cotton.

186
00:09:24,855 --> 00:09:27,316
-Cotton's... friend.
-[grunts]

187
00:09:27,608 --> 00:09:29,610
I really liked the song
you walked in with.

188
00:09:29,694 --> 00:09:32,029
Uh, but what if it went more like this?

189
00:09:32,113 --> 00:09:34,532
-[gasps]
-[growls]

190
00:09:47,169 --> 00:09:49,130
-Whoa!
-Whoa, she's on to something.

191
00:09:49,213 --> 00:09:53,009
She just needs a...
a little... a little help.

192
00:09:53,092 --> 00:09:56,178
Maybe we'll help her this one last time,
and then we'll leave.

193
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:58,973
Yeah. Yeah, one more time
for old time's sake.

194
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:00,516
Sorry.

195
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,810
[screaming]

196
00:10:02,893 --> 00:10:04,020
[drumming]

197
00:10:04,103 --> 00:10:04,979
What?

198
00:10:06,564 --> 00:10:09,442
[screaming rhythmically]

199
00:10:10,026 --> 00:10:13,237
[Dave vocalizing]

200
00:10:15,364 --> 00:10:17,116
[both exclaiming]

201
00:10:17,199 --> 00:10:18,284
[grunting]

202
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:22,997
[all vocalizing]

203
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:24,457
[grunts]

204
00:10:35,676 --> 00:10:36,719
[grunts]

205
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:40,056
That's it.
That's the riff I was looking for!

206
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:44,185
I can't believe we were gonna eat you.
You have the hands of an angel.

207
00:10:44,268 --> 00:10:46,312
So, we can be on our way?

208
00:10:46,395 --> 00:10:48,439
You don't mind
if we cross through your territory?

209
00:10:49,815 --> 00:10:51,901
[chuckles]
Not when you shred like that.

210
00:10:51,984 --> 00:10:56,280
-You can come through here any time.
-I cannot believe that worked.

211
00:10:56,364 --> 00:10:57,573
It shouldn't have.
You got lucky.

212
00:10:57,657 --> 00:10:59,700
Lucky? Give me some credit.

213
00:10:59,784 --> 00:11:01,077
-We're all alive.
-For now.

214
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:04,038
But, eventually, your crazy ideas
are gonna get us all killed!

215
00:11:04,121 --> 00:11:06,207
Or maybe they would've gotten us
to my dad sooner

216
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:07,541
if you'd listen to me for once.

217
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:09,627
OK, Kipo, what was your big plan again?

218
00:11:10,002 --> 00:11:11,045
Have your cat army...

219
00:11:11,128 --> 00:11:12,380
-Uh...
-...pin the Mega Mute down

220
00:11:12,463 --> 00:11:14,674
so you could say, "Give me back my dad!"

221
00:11:14,757 --> 00:11:16,258
Let's do that and see what happens.

222
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:18,803
-[grunts] Fine!
-Fine!

223
00:11:18,886 --> 00:11:20,012
[snorts]

224
00:11:20,638 --> 00:11:21,639
Hey, bandmates!

225
00:11:21,722 --> 00:11:24,058
Would you happen to know
where we can find a Mega Mute?

226
00:11:24,141 --> 00:11:25,226
You may have seen it.

227
00:11:25,309 --> 00:11:27,645
Six arms, destroys homes
and burrows for fun?

228
00:11:27,728 --> 00:11:30,648
Yeah, we've seen it.
Wrecked our tour bus.

229
00:11:30,731 --> 00:11:32,817
I mean, we already trashed it, but still.

230
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:35,736
Would you take us to it?
I have some questions I need to ask.

231
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:39,031
You wanna ask that thing questions?

232
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:40,783
OK, sure.

233
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:41,951
Neh!

234
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:48,207
I think our new guitar player
is a bit insane.

235
00:11:48,457 --> 00:11:50,376
The best ones usually are.

236
00:11:55,297 --> 00:11:57,299
Dave, I've thought about it.

237
00:11:57,383 --> 00:11:59,301
Rocking out with
the umlaut snakes was a trip

238
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:01,929
-and a story I wanna tell over and over.
-[groaning]

239
00:12:02,012 --> 00:12:04,932
But I cannot do that
if we get eaten by a Mega Mute.

240
00:12:05,015 --> 00:12:08,477
So, we should just tell Kipo
we're gonna leave, and then leave.

241
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:09,478
You're right.

242
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:11,856
We just need to find the right time.

243
00:12:11,939 --> 00:12:13,566
There's never a right time!

244
00:12:13,649 --> 00:12:15,276
You just gotta pull the band-aid off!

245
00:12:15,818 --> 00:12:21,407
Hey, Kipo, so, you know, like, band-aids,
uh, they're hard to rip off.

246
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:23,576
-[both growl]
-[chuckles nervously]

247
00:12:23,659 --> 00:12:26,412
Let's, uh, yeah, let's keep
that band-aid on a little bit longer.

248
00:12:27,371 --> 00:12:29,415
[snoring]

249
00:12:29,665 --> 00:12:31,167
Whoa, hold on.

250
00:12:33,002 --> 00:12:36,964
-The bus wrecker's asleep.
-[snake 2] It's just in that grove.

251
00:12:37,047 --> 00:12:39,175
Not even we're crazy enough
to go in there.

252
00:12:39,675 --> 00:12:40,593
Thank you.

253
00:12:42,928 --> 00:12:45,514
[gasps]
The cats! What happened to them?

254
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:49,643
-You didn't eat them, did you?
-Not yet.

255
00:12:49,727 --> 00:12:51,979
Our bandmates trapped 'em
in the Glamyrinth.

256
00:12:52,062 --> 00:12:55,191
We're tiring them out first.
They're easier to eat that way.

257
00:12:56,567 --> 00:12:57,985
Meow!

258
00:12:58,068 --> 00:12:59,487

260
00:13:01,572 --> 00:13:03,032
-Run!
-Run!

261
00:13:03,324 --> 00:13:04,992
[both chuckling]
Cats.

262
00:13:05,534 --> 00:13:09,705
I just have one more favor to ask.
Bandmate to bandmate.

263
00:13:09,788 --> 00:13:10,664
Could you let them out?

264
00:13:10,748 --> 00:13:13,000
They're just looking for
their scratching tree.

265
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:15,002
Without them,
we never would've rocked out together.

266
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:19,048
That session was pretty epic.
OK, we'll consider it.

267
00:13:19,131 --> 00:13:20,466
Thank you.

268
00:13:20,549 --> 00:13:24,053
She's really going in there
to face the six-armed beast.

269
00:13:24,136 --> 00:13:25,679
-[snake] So metal.
-[snoring]

270
00:13:25,763 --> 00:13:27,014
[Cotton] What a waste of talent.

271
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:31,018
Hey, Kipo.

272
00:13:31,268 --> 00:13:33,771
OK, this is it.

273
00:13:33,854 --> 00:13:36,148
I know this is dangerous,
but I have to do this.

274
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:37,900
None of you have to come with me.

275
00:13:37,983 --> 00:13:39,235
[snorting]

276
00:13:47,076 --> 00:13:47,910
[nervous chuckle]

277
00:13:56,043 --> 00:13:58,546
Oh, she's leaving us.

278
00:13:58,629 --> 00:14:01,215
That was a lot easier than I thought.

279
00:14:01,882 --> 00:14:04,260
I'm not sure how I feel about this.

280
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:07,638
[snoring]

281
00:14:12,309 --> 00:14:13,227
[Wolf] There it is.

282
00:14:19,066 --> 00:14:20,150
Go ahead and say it.

283
00:14:20,234 --> 00:14:24,154
If this thing had my people...
it ate them.

284
00:14:24,238 --> 00:14:26,532
It's what you're thinking.
I know it.

285
00:14:27,324 --> 00:14:28,784
You don't know what I'm thinking.

286
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:32,580
I'm thinking they could be
trapped in that old hotel.

287
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:36,750
Do you really believe that?

288
00:14:40,254 --> 00:14:41,839
[squealing]

289
00:14:45,175 --> 00:14:46,719

Wolf, you're right!

291
00:14:49,013 --> 00:14:50,306
He's gotta be in that hotel!

292
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:52,057
Dad! Are you in there?

293
00:14:52,141 --> 00:14:53,309

Do you think she's OK?

I already miss her.

-[shouting]
-You know what, Dave?

305
00:15:34,808 --> 00:15:38,312
When we were with Kipo, we were
doing something more than just surviving.

306
00:15:38,395 --> 00:15:39,772
For the first time ever,

307
00:15:39,855 --> 00:15:41,523
we were a part of something
bigger than us.

308
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:46,195
-I'm going back in, man!
-Kipo, we're coming for ya!

We had to come back for the show!

Now's our chance.

-[roars]
-We can go into that hotel.

317
00:16:18,102 --> 00:16:19,645
Find your dad.

318
00:16:20,354 --> 00:16:22,606
No! We have to help the cats first.

319
00:16:23,023 --> 00:16:25,317
-I have a plan.
-Is it going to get us killed?

320
00:16:25,401 --> 00:16:28,112
Maybe not.
'Cause this time, you're part of it.

[sighs] Let's hear it.

322
00:16:30,614 --> 00:16:32,241
I'll distract the monkey with music.

323
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:33,659
I mean, it worked on the snakes.

324
00:16:33,742 --> 00:16:36,245
And then, you sneak up
and hit it with the death stalker.

325
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:37,496

Neat!

366
00:19:01,265 --> 00:19:03,934
So, a few days ago,
you broke into my burrow,

367
00:19:04,017 --> 00:19:06,562
and now I can't find my people or my dad.

368
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:10,232
Did you, um... eat them?

We've decided not to leave you.

-What? You were going to leave?
-Uh, who?

No! Yes. Maybe. A little.

we've decided to commit.

And what you did with that Mega Monkey,
that was amazing.

But we know he's alive
and that my burrow got away.

That's more than I knew before.

-We do?

00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:56,148
That monkey was clearly under
some sort of mind control.

420
00:21:56,231 --> 00:21:58,650
Your song snapped her
out of it temporarily.

421
00:21:58,734 --> 00:22:01,361
There are rumors about
a mute with the ability to do that...

Oh...
Still don't know who that is.

425
00:22:10,203 --> 00:22:13,206
[Wolf] If he sent that monkey,
he must be targeting burrows.

426
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:15,959
There's a good chance Scarlemagne
is looking for your people.

427
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:18,879
So, we have to find them first.
