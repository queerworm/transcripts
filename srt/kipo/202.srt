We don't have time for cheese!

176
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:50,816
We might have time for cheese.

177
00:10:51,359 --> 00:10:54,612
It's OK, Wolf.
It is a little bit weird.

178
00:10:54,695 --> 00:10:56,614
No, Kipo, it's very weird.

179
00:10:56,697 --> 00:10:59,784
But if I have to make cheese
to start training, I'll do it.

180
00:10:59,867 --> 00:11:02,912
And if I have to eat that cheese,
I'll do it.

181
00:11:02,995 --> 00:11:03,996
I'll do it.

182
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,457
All right, guys.
Let's do this.

183
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:09,210
Ah-ah-ah.

184
00:11:09,293 --> 00:11:12,797
This is a journey she must go on alone.

185
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,131
Alone with us!

186
00:11:14,215 --> 00:11:15,633
What? Why?

187
00:11:15,716 --> 00:11:19,178
Sacred wisdom.

188
00:11:19,261 --> 00:11:21,597
-I totally buy that.
-I don't.

189
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:24,016
[roaring]

190
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:28,521
-Hey.
-Don't worry, Wolf!

191
00:11:28,604 --> 00:11:31,816
[imitating Bev]
Sacred wisdom.

192
00:11:34,402 --> 00:11:38,489
Wow!
It's cheese-making heaven in here.

193
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:50,668
Huh?
What are these for?

194
00:11:50,751 --> 00:11:52,878
You just put the herbs in.

195
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:56,715
You must evenly distribute them
while the curd cooks.

196
00:11:57,341 --> 00:12:00,344
Just a pinch at a time.
Like this.

197
00:12:00,428 --> 00:12:04,723
Herbs in, herbs out.
Herbs in, herbs out.

198
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:07,309
Oh. That's it?
That's all I have to do?

199
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:08,811
Herbs in, herbs out.

200
00:12:08,894 --> 00:12:11,439
Oh, we'll do the rest.
It's easy, dear.

201
00:12:11,605 --> 00:12:12,815
You just...

202
00:12:12,898 --> 00:12:14,525
[overlapping chatter]
...get your milk to 88 degrees,

203
00:12:14,608 --> 00:12:16,485
-then measure your rennet.
-Then there's draining the curd,

204
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:18,612
-and then salting the curd...
-Then you add the coagulant,

205
00:12:18,696 --> 00:12:23,409
-test for gel firmness and cut the curd!
-And that's when you put the herbs in!

206
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:26,328
Uh... what was all of that?

207
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:29,165
Oh, you just keep at it
with the herbs, dear.

208
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:33,210
Does it look like
we can see what you're doing?

209
00:12:33,294 --> 00:12:34,420
Say it out loud.

210
00:12:35,004 --> 00:12:37,423
Herbs in? Herbs out?

211
00:12:37,506 --> 00:12:39,091
-Herbs in... [grunts]
-Whoops.

212
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:43,512
-Yowch!
-[gasps] What's wrong?

213
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:45,055
Did you forget to put the herbs in?

214
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:46,724
Nope.

215
00:12:46,807 --> 00:12:47,850
I'm on it!

216
00:12:48,976 --> 00:12:51,979
[winces in pain]
Herbs in! Herbs out!

217
00:12:52,062 --> 00:12:53,314
Herbs in!

218
00:12:53,397 --> 00:12:54,440
[gasps]

219
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:57,610
Bev, will you toss me
those ghost peppers?

220
00:12:58,652 --> 00:13:00,779
[screams in pain]

221
00:13:00,863 --> 00:13:02,573
Oh, don't forget those herbs!

222
00:13:03,115 --> 00:13:04,867
Herbs in. Herbs out.

223
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:07,786
-Herbs in...
-Girls, the milk isn't hot enough!

224
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:09,997
Um, uh, uh, it's pretty hot!

225
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,415
[inhaling deeply]

226
00:13:11,499 --> 00:13:12,750
[screams]

227
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:19,298
[grunts]

228
00:13:19,381 --> 00:13:21,300
Ooh! The milk is curdling.

229
00:13:22,176 --> 00:13:24,553
Time to cut the curd!

230
00:13:25,179 --> 00:13:26,639
[yelps]

231
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:28,724
Uh...

232
00:13:29,433 --> 00:13:31,727
[Ida]
I don't hear you putting herbs in!

233
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:34,688
Herbs in.
Herbs out.

234
00:13:34,772 --> 00:13:36,815
Herbs in.
Herbs out.

235
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:38,609
Herbs in.
Herbs out.

236
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:41,654
[snorts]

237
00:13:41,737 --> 00:13:43,739
[straining]

238
00:13:43,822 --> 00:13:45,866
OK, you asked for it.

239
00:13:47,576 --> 00:13:49,662
[grunting]

240
00:13:53,457 --> 00:13:54,875
Oh, come on!

241
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:57,795
Wolf, you are messing with forces
you can't possibly understand.

242
00:13:57,878 --> 00:14:00,214
You do not want to make that cheese mad.

243
00:14:00,297 --> 00:14:03,759
Don't be ridiculous, Dave!
Now help me move this pig.

244
00:14:04,927 --> 00:14:06,595
I'm sure it's fine, Wolf.

245
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:08,639
If Kipo needs our help,
she'll let us know.

246
00:14:08,722 --> 00:14:10,766
Come on!

247
00:14:10,849 --> 00:14:12,810
Come on!

248
00:14:12,893 --> 00:14:15,062
[roars]

249
00:14:15,145 --> 00:14:16,689
She... she let us know.

250
00:14:19,066 --> 00:14:20,859
[squealing]

251
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:23,279
Good job, Mandu.

252
00:14:27,032 --> 00:14:28,617
[groans]

253
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:37,585
[gasps]

254
00:14:41,422 --> 00:14:42,923
What did you do to our friend?!

255
00:14:43,007 --> 00:14:45,175
Is something wrong, dear?

256
00:14:45,426 --> 00:14:46,552
Yes!

257
00:14:46,635 --> 00:14:48,220
[snorts]

258
00:14:51,974 --> 00:14:53,100
[grunts]

259
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:56,562
I still don't get how or why
all this happens.

260
00:14:56,645 --> 00:14:59,648
And if I can't figure that out,
I can't become a Mega Jaguar

261
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:01,609
and help everyone who's counting on me!

262
00:15:01,692 --> 00:15:05,112
I came here for help,
but instead I'm, like, half-jaguar.

263
00:15:05,362 --> 00:15:07,865
Also, I smell like cheese!

264
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:10,743
-Good.
-That's what we were going for!

265
00:15:10,826 --> 00:15:12,745
Including the smell!

266
00:15:12,828 --> 00:15:15,748
[grumbles] What?!

267
00:15:15,831 --> 00:15:18,000
Sorry to put you through all that,

268
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:22,713
but we needed you to see that the jaguar
is always there to protect you.

269
00:15:22,796 --> 00:15:25,299
That's why I threw knives at you!

270
00:15:25,716 --> 00:15:30,346
-How do you know all this about me?
-You're ready to hear the tale.

271
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:32,848
Your poor father was on the run...

272
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:34,642
<i>looking for shelter.</i>

273
00:15:34,725 --> 00:15:36,352
<i>He had just lost your mother,</i>

274
00:15:36,435 --> 00:15:39,521
<i>and he had to abandon the burrow</i>
<i>where you were born.</i>

275
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:42,399
<i>He wandered into our forest.</i>

276
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:48,072
Oh, boy. The cheese tells me
they just spat up a baby.

277
00:15:48,322 --> 00:15:50,532
Aw.
Too precious.

278
00:15:50,699 --> 00:15:54,828
[Florabel]<i> He asked us for guidance,</i>
<i>so we had him make cheese.</i>

279
00:15:54,912 --> 00:15:56,789
[Benson]
<i>Is that your solution to everything?</i>

280
00:15:56,872 --> 00:15:58,832
[Dave]
<i>It's a good solution!</i>

281
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:01,752
[coos]

282
00:16:05,923 --> 00:16:10,386
-It went away!
-Yes, because she feels safe.

283
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:12,680
You can stay here for a few days,

284
00:16:12,763 --> 00:16:16,558
but I'm afraid the surface
is no place for your little Kipo.

285
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:20,270
If she stays up here,
the jaguar will be the dominant side.

286
00:16:20,354 --> 00:16:22,815
If you want her human side
to remain in control,

287
00:16:22,898 --> 00:16:25,401
you need to foster that.
In a burrow.

288
00:16:26,068 --> 00:16:28,612
And make sure to water her every day!

289
00:16:28,696 --> 00:16:30,406
We can't go back to our burrow.

290
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:34,410
There are other burrows.
I heard about it, from the cheese.

291
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:37,121
What about when it's time for her
to become a jaguar?

292
00:16:37,204 --> 00:16:39,581
You just bring her right on back.

293
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:42,418
[coos]

294
00:16:46,922 --> 00:16:48,215
You hear that, little one?

295
00:16:48,716 --> 00:16:50,467
One day you'll be back here.

296
00:16:52,386 --> 00:16:54,096
Kipo! Your arm!

297
00:16:54,221 --> 00:16:56,765
[gasps]
It's going away!

298
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:58,892
[gasps]
But why won't it go all the way?

299
00:16:59,351 --> 00:17:00,811
Breathe deep.

300
00:17:00,894 --> 00:17:03,313
Now think about being safe
with your father.

301
00:17:03,397 --> 00:17:05,441
Herbs out.

302
00:17:20,205 --> 00:17:22,291
Herbs out.

303
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:24,835
It worked!
[gasps]

304
00:17:24,918 --> 00:17:26,170
How did that...?

305
00:17:26,253 --> 00:17:29,131
Oh, the gesture
helps ground and focus you.

306
00:17:29,214 --> 00:17:34,553
Try again! When you do herbs in,
think about needing that jaguar.

307
00:17:34,636 --> 00:17:35,971
When you do herbs out,

308
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:38,932
remember how it felt
to be safe with your dad.

309
00:17:40,768 --> 00:17:42,227
Herbs in.

310
00:17:44,772 --> 00:17:45,981
Herbs out.

311
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:47,983
-[gasps] Kipo, you did it!
-I did it!

312
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:50,903
-I controlled it!
-[laughs] Paw master!

313
00:17:50,986 --> 00:17:52,279
[squeals]

314
00:17:52,988 --> 00:17:55,908
That-that-that-that-that-that's
two human hands.

315
00:17:55,991 --> 00:17:57,284
I knew these goats were for real!

316
00:17:57,367 --> 00:17:59,828
Does anybody need a paw?
Because I got one.

317
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:01,080
Herbs in!

318
00:18:01,163 --> 00:18:02,164
-[gasps]
-No? No one needs it?

319
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:04,041
-That's OK. Herbs out!
-[grunts]

320
00:18:05,542 --> 00:18:07,377
I have to admit,
even I'm impressed.

321
00:18:08,128 --> 00:18:12,007
Does this mean I'm ready to become
the Mega Jaguar and save my people?

322
00:18:12,508 --> 00:18:14,218
Let's consult the cheese, shall we?

323
00:18:17,304 --> 00:18:21,350
So, the girl with the purple jaguar paw
who got past my guards,

324
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:26,730
and is immune to my pheromones,
is actually your daughter.

325
00:18:27,272 --> 00:18:28,982
Fascinating.

326
00:18:29,066 --> 00:18:31,235
Of course, this means
I'll have to eliminate her.

327
00:18:32,194 --> 00:18:36,448
Although, if she could control
her inner beastie,

328
00:18:36,532 --> 00:18:39,493
and I could make her
sympathetic to my cause...

329
00:18:39,868 --> 00:18:41,995
Why, I'd be unstoppable!

330
00:18:42,704 --> 00:18:47,209
Imagine if your little
science experiment was my pet!

331
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:49,336

332
00:18:49,419 --> 00:18:50,462

333
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:55,968
Good luck.
You don't know Kipo.

334
00:18:56,635 --> 00:18:57,886
-Ooh, ooh.
-[grunts]

335
00:18:59,388 --> 00:19:02,099
Careful now.
Don't want to spill a drop.

336
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:04,017
Thank you, Lio.

337
00:19:04,726 --> 00:19:09,064
Now I have my army,
and an endless supply of pheromones.

338
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:12,317
All I'm missing is Kipo.

339
00:19:12,734 --> 00:19:14,695

They put their nasty hooves in it.

-[chanting] Feta, gouda, chevre, fromage.
-What a waste of cheese.

345
00:19:47,227 --> 00:19:52,149
Feta, gouda, chevre, fromage.

346
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:54,693
[squeals]

347
00:19:54,776 --> 00:20:01,074
If you wish to save your people,
you must indeed become the Mega Jaguar.

348
00:20:01,158 --> 00:20:05,662
But the beast within you is strong.
Too Strong.

349
00:20:05,746 --> 00:20:09,583
If you become the Mega,
you will lose yourself to it.

350
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:11,543
-[roaring]
-[all gasp]

351
00:20:11,627 --> 00:20:14,004
What?
But what about herbs in, herbs out?

352
00:20:14,087 --> 00:20:16,131
It isn't enough.

353
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:18,091
Once you become a Mega,

354
00:20:18,592 --> 00:20:22,554
you will lose sight of everything
that makes you human.

355
00:20:22,763 --> 00:20:25,807
But your path is not set in stone.

356
00:20:26,099 --> 00:20:28,268
You can prevent this future.

357
00:20:28,352 --> 00:20:31,897
Together, you must find something tangible

358
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:35,400
that binds you
to who you are at your core.

359
00:20:35,484 --> 00:20:38,695
A core that's on the outside.

360
00:20:38,779 --> 00:20:40,572
An an-chor!

361
00:20:40,656 --> 00:20:44,117
An anchor will guide you
out of the beast.

362
00:20:44,201 --> 00:20:47,412
The cheese has spoken.

363
00:20:49,748 --> 00:20:51,792
But who am I at my core?

364
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:55,045
I used to be Kipo, happy-go-lucky girl
from the Clover Burrow.

365
00:20:55,128 --> 00:20:57,381
But I'm not even from the Clover Burrow.

366
00:20:57,464 --> 00:21:00,759
If I don't know where I'm from,
how am I supposed to know who I am?

367
00:21:01,426 --> 00:21:03,095
Then start at the beginning!

368
00:21:03,178 --> 00:21:05,639
Oh, that sounded smart.
Did I say that?

369
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:08,850
I was born in another burrow.

370
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:10,352
My parents' burrow.

371
00:21:10,435 --> 00:21:11,895
I never knew that.

372
00:21:11,979 --> 00:21:13,272
That's where we'll go.

373
00:21:13,355 --> 00:21:14,731
That's where I'll learn about myself,

374
00:21:14,815 --> 00:21:18,860
so I can find the thing
that reminds me of me.

375
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:20,404
Why did my dad abandon it?

376
00:21:20,487 --> 00:21:24,199
-He didn't tell us, kid.
-Well, do you know where it is?

377
00:21:25,659 --> 00:21:29,079
I'm afraid the cheese can't make it out.

378
00:21:29,162 --> 00:21:31,790
Yeah, it's not really reliable
for directions.

379
00:21:31,873 --> 00:21:33,542
[snorts]

380
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:36,878
That's OK, because we can find it.

381
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:41,216
Wait.
Where did you guys get the milk?

382
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:47,472
[all chanting]
<i>Feta, gouda, chevre, fromage.</i>

383
00:21:47,556 --> 00:21:52,561
<i>Feta, gouda, chevre, fromage.</i>

384
00:21:52,644 --> 00:21:57,899
<i>Feta, gouda, chevre, fromage.</i>

385
00:21:57,983 --> 00:22:03,071
<i>Feta, gouda, chevre, fromage.</i>
