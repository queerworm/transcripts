00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,794
You must have a really great plan.

176
00:09:04,877 --> 00:09:07,713
These sewer tunnels connect HQ to Aurum.

177
00:09:07,797 --> 00:09:09,882
We'll break the humans out,
and bring them here.

178
00:09:09,966 --> 00:09:13,177
How? Aren't you afraid
that Scarlemagne will mind control you?

179
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:17,640
Not once we get him into this.
It's completely pheromone proof.

180
00:09:17,723 --> 00:09:20,184
-Wow.
-[Dave] Hey, what's this?

181
00:09:20,268 --> 00:09:21,143
[grunts]

182
00:09:21,894 --> 00:09:24,772
-I wouldn't do that.
-Challenge accepted.

183
00:09:24,855 --> 00:09:27,358
-[sound waves whirring]
-[screaming]

184
00:09:27,441 --> 00:09:29,277
Challenge failed!
Challenge failed!

185
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,737
-What is this?
-It's a Sonic Emitter.

186
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:34,282
-[Mandu squealing]
-The frequency only bothers mutes.

187
00:09:34,365 --> 00:09:36,659
Our plan is to use it on Scarlemagne.

188
00:09:45,334 --> 00:09:47,336
[yelling]

189
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:51,465
[Emilia] And then,
he won't have time to pheromone us

190
00:09:51,549 --> 00:09:53,175
before we get him in the box.

191
00:09:53,301 --> 00:09:54,176
[sound waves stop]

192
00:09:54,552 --> 00:09:55,428
[squeals]

193
00:09:56,178 --> 00:09:57,763
It's not that bad!

194
00:09:57,847 --> 00:10:00,641
[Emilia] When our friend wakes up
from that awful mind control,

195
00:10:00,725 --> 00:10:02,935
we'll get the intel to finalize our plan.

196
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:07,398
Roberto?
This is Troy's dad!

197
00:10:07,481 --> 00:10:09,650
Troy? What?!

198
00:10:09,734 --> 00:10:12,320
I mean, uh, Troy,
who we took to Timbercat Village?

199
00:10:12,403 --> 00:10:14,030
[chuckles]
Not like I miss him.

200
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:15,072
He'll wake up soon.

201
00:10:15,156 --> 00:10:17,867
Someone apologize
for shooting him out of the sky,

202
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:19,744
and give him a hot cocoa.

203
00:10:19,827 --> 00:10:22,580
You and me,
we're going outside to start training.

204
00:10:22,663 --> 00:10:24,665
Right. I should train.

205
00:10:24,749 --> 00:10:27,126
Worked hard to get this anchor,
time to use it.

206
00:10:27,209 --> 00:10:29,712
I'm fine! Thanks!
[yelps]

207
00:10:29,795 --> 00:10:31,839
I'll go with you.
I've got the anchor to bring you back.

208
00:10:31,922 --> 00:10:33,716
Hey, uh, Wolf.

209
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:39,180
While I'm gone, could you, I don't know,
make me look good in front of Troy's dad?

210
00:10:39,263 --> 00:10:41,223
You know, if it comes up
organically in conversation.

211
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:42,642
Uh, why?

212
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:44,435
Oh...

213
00:10:44,518 --> 00:10:46,437
Is this because you
and Troy have that date thing?

214
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:48,773
[gasps]
You do? Why didn't you tell me?

215
00:10:48,856 --> 00:10:51,192
Can I come?
Wait. Never mind.

216
00:10:51,275 --> 00:10:54,362
Come on, Kipo.
It's time to go full jaguar.

217
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,657
[sighs]

218
00:11:00,034 --> 00:11:01,118
Huh? Oh.

219
00:11:01,202 --> 00:11:02,662
I don't know why it's not working!

220
00:11:02,745 --> 00:11:04,830
[sighs]
Let's try again.

221
00:11:04,914 --> 00:11:06,165
[grunting]

222
00:11:06,415 --> 00:11:07,416
Hey!

223
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:10,044
[Benson] This should be
a walk in the park for a Mega Jaguar!

224
00:11:10,127 --> 00:11:12,880
Why isn't she transforming all the way?

225
00:11:12,963 --> 00:11:15,800
-Hey! I'm trying my best.
-It's not enough.

226
00:11:15,883 --> 00:11:19,053
Maybe it'll help if we up the stakes.

227
00:11:19,136 --> 00:11:22,556
Or...
Or, I could try talking to her first.

228
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:26,310
-I think I know what's wrong.
-Sure, kid, give it a shot.

229
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,275
-Hey.
-Hey.

230
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:35,903
I don't know why I can't transform.

231
00:11:35,986 --> 00:11:40,157
If I can't do this, how am I supposed
to save my mom from Scarlemagne?

232
00:11:40,241 --> 00:11:44,453
Any chance not going full jaguar
has something to do with this?

233
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:48,666
Now that you mention it, maybe?

234
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:50,501
Yeah.

235
00:11:50,584 --> 00:11:54,463
-Look, I told you, I'm fine.
-That doesn't make it OK.

236
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:55,881
And what if I hurt my people?

237
00:11:55,965 --> 00:11:58,634
Kipo, that's why you have to
train to control it.

238
00:11:58,717 --> 00:12:03,013
Or, I can control it by never going Mega.
Ever!

239
00:12:03,097 --> 00:12:06,684
It's the only way I can be sure
I won't ever hurt anyone again.

240
00:12:06,767 --> 00:12:09,353
Kipo, you are stronger than the jaguar.

241
00:12:09,437 --> 00:12:12,148
You just need to trust yourself.
I trust you.

242
00:12:17,486 --> 00:12:19,196
But I don't.

243
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:24,994
I don't know, Benson said something like,
"Flapjacks are pancakes."

244
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:27,163
And then, Troy said, "It's a date."

245
00:12:27,246 --> 00:12:29,206
Ooh! And then what?!

246
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:30,291
[yells]

247
00:12:30,374 --> 00:12:31,333
Where am I?
Who are you?

248
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:33,669
You're safe.
Roberto, right?

249
00:12:33,752 --> 00:12:37,506
You were being mind controlled
by Scarlemagne, and Dr. Emilia saved you.

250
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:39,925
-We're Kipo's friends.
-Oh, good.

251
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:43,179
-Wait, but what about Troy?
-He's OK. He's with the Timbercats.

252
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:46,474
Thanks to my main man Benson!

253
00:12:46,557 --> 00:12:48,809
Oh, that's wonderful.

254
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:51,979
Also, uh, what are Timbercats,
and who is Benson?

255
00:12:52,062 --> 00:12:54,523
They're talking cats
with plaid shirts and axes.

256
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:58,486
-Troy's fine.
-And Benson's our good friend.

257
00:12:58,569 --> 00:13:01,155
And he knows how to save people.

258
00:13:01,238 --> 00:13:04,700
One time, he...
saved a bunch of kids from...

259
00:13:04,783 --> 00:13:07,203
an acid spitting Mega Walrus.

260
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:08,496
Look! He's awake!

261
00:13:08,579 --> 00:13:10,664
It's imperative that you tell us
everything you know

262
00:13:10,748 --> 00:13:12,458
about Scarlemagne's coronation.

263
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:15,336
Every... single... detail.

264
00:13:15,419 --> 00:13:17,505
Your face is really close to my face.

265
00:13:17,588 --> 00:13:20,424
Speaking of faces,
you know who has a great face?

266
00:13:20,508 --> 00:13:21,967
My friend Benson!

267
00:13:22,426 --> 00:13:24,220
He's going to put all the humans here,

268
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:26,889
and mind control us all at once,
in front of everyone.

269
00:13:26,972 --> 00:13:29,391
That's our chance.
We have to get to those humans,

270
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:31,143
before they enter the arena.

271
00:13:31,227 --> 00:13:34,563
Oh, Benson can do that!
He's great at breaking into places.

272
00:13:36,065 --> 00:13:38,234
In a good, hero type of way.

273
00:13:38,776 --> 00:13:40,194
Benson!
You're back!

274
00:13:40,277 --> 00:13:42,613
I thought it felt a lot safer in here.

275
00:13:43,113 --> 00:13:45,241
I heard about the Mega Walrus.

276
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:47,076
How did you save all of those kids?

277
00:13:48,994 --> 00:13:52,331
Uh, I honestly have no idea.

278
00:13:52,873 --> 00:13:56,001
-How was training?
-Great! I didn't hurt anybody.

279
00:13:56,085 --> 00:13:58,671
I also didn't transform once.

280
00:13:58,754 --> 00:14:00,130
[rumbling]

281
00:14:04,468 --> 00:14:08,514
Um, hello.
Sorry for, uh, just bursting in like this.

282
00:14:08,597 --> 00:14:12,393
I'm Geli, and this is Jibralta.
We were nearby, when we heard--

283
00:14:12,476 --> 00:14:14,687
Heard the call of an alien communicator!

284
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:17,189
[mimicking sound wave sounds]

285
00:14:17,898 --> 00:14:19,984
We know it's here, somewhere.

286
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:22,403
[gasps]

287
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:26,073
-[grunts]
-What is this? What does this do?

288
00:14:27,116 --> 00:14:28,742
Somebody shoot those flying rats!

289
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:31,203
[yelling]

290
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:32,413
[grunts]

291
00:14:33,747 --> 00:14:35,583
[screaming]

292
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:37,334
Nah, I'm just kidding.

293
00:14:37,418 --> 00:14:39,003
But seriously, this hurts.
[grunts]

294
00:14:39,086 --> 00:14:41,714
Get out of my way!
We know it's here. Somewhere.

295
00:14:41,797 --> 00:14:43,549
[groans, grunts]

296
00:14:45,676 --> 00:14:47,469
[groans]
I know these bats.

297
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:50,556
They think the sonic emitter
is an alien communicator.

298
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:51,974
I got this, guys.

299
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:53,183
[both] Yeah!

300
00:14:54,351 --> 00:14:56,186
[roars]

301
00:14:59,773 --> 00:15:04,194
Just turn into the Mega Jaguar.
Why isn't she turning?

302
00:15:04,278 --> 00:15:05,195
[groans]

303
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:06,405
[both laughing]

304
00:15:06,488 --> 00:15:07,656
Look at her fly!

305
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:10,659
I have the communicator right here!

306
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:13,078
And I can use it
to summon my alien friends.

307
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:14,496
-[gasps]
-[Kipo yells]

308
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:17,958
-You! The Alien Whisperer.
-You're coming with us!

309
00:15:18,042 --> 00:15:19,877
-[grunts]
-[gasps] Benson!

310
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:22,546
I trust you, Kipo!

311
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:26,967
[groans]

312
00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:28,344
-[Emilia] Is everyone OK?
-No!

313
00:15:28,677 --> 00:15:31,931
They took Benson!
My Benson!

314
00:15:32,014 --> 00:15:35,017
-We have to go after them!
-How? We don't know where they went.

315
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:38,187
That sonic emitter was our best hope
for defeating Scarlemagne.

316
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:40,689
Who cares about the stupid emitter?

317
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:43,692
Benson!

318
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:46,487
Don't worry.
I'll get them both back.

319
00:15:48,989 --> 00:15:49,907
[grunts]

320
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:53,369
Welcome, friend to aliens.
You are familiar with our mothership.

321
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:54,620
That's the name of our home!

322
00:15:54,703 --> 00:15:58,165
What are you waiting for?
Contact those aliens.

323
00:15:58,248 --> 00:16:00,125
Right. Right. Of course.

324
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:03,545
It's a complicated sequence.
Let me see if I can even remember.

325
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:06,799
Whoo!
Twist here, hold it clockwise, shake it,

326
00:16:06,882 --> 00:16:09,802
then a double tap on the fibrillator
and uh, we're all good.

327
00:16:09,885 --> 00:16:10,928
-[roaring]
-[yells]

328
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:13,889
The aliens!
They're here.

329
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:16,350
Already? Oh.
I... I haven't brushed my fangs.

330
00:16:16,433 --> 00:16:18,018
-[roaring]
-[both grunt]

331
00:16:18,727 --> 00:16:21,605
That's no alien.
That's just a dumb lion!

332
00:16:21,689 --> 00:16:22,815
[roars]

333
00:16:22,898 --> 00:16:23,732
[gasps]

334
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:25,859
[grunting]

335
00:16:39,289 --> 00:16:40,499
[growls]

336
00:16:42,042 --> 00:16:44,253
Hey, Kipo.
It's OK.

337
00:16:44,336 --> 00:16:46,422
[growling]

338
00:16:50,092 --> 00:16:51,593
I trust you.

339
00:16:59,893 --> 00:17:02,938
Whoo-hoo! Yes!
I knew you could do it!

340
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:04,982
[giggles]
Thanks, Benson.

341
00:17:05,065 --> 00:17:06,942
For a minute, there I thought
I was gonna lose control,

342
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:09,862
but knowing that you believed in me,
made me believe in me, and--

343
00:17:09,945 --> 00:17:11,613
Um, still gotta take care of these bats.

344
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:14,116
Oh. Right.
We'll return to this.

345
00:17:15,409 --> 00:17:18,495
-She is an alien!
-A shape-shifting humanoid.

346
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:21,248
Oh, no!
I called the alien a dumb lion!

347
00:17:21,331 --> 00:17:22,791
Now she'll never take us with her.

348
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:24,084
-[roars]
-[both yelling]

349
00:17:24,168 --> 00:17:26,587
She said, don't let it happen again!

350
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:27,671
But, she's over it.

351
00:17:27,755 --> 00:17:31,258
[gasps]
You're speaking with... the alien?

352
00:17:31,341 --> 00:17:33,177
How many alien languages do you know?

353
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:36,680
Jaguardian, Dave-Dave, Wolfatha Christew,

354
00:17:36,764 --> 00:17:39,767
the one that just sounds like
a bunch of beeps, and Mandukin.

355
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:41,268
[growls]

356
00:17:41,351 --> 00:17:43,520
Well, uh, we gotta go.
[chucklers]

357
00:17:43,604 --> 00:17:46,023
Top secret alien mission, and all.
So, uh, you get it.

358
00:17:46,106 --> 00:17:47,357
-Oh...
-We really do.

359
00:17:47,441 --> 00:17:48,275
[overlapping dialogue]

360
00:17:48,358 --> 00:17:49,777
[Jibralta] This is what we do.
We really do.

361
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:51,320
[Geli] We do top secret
alien mission stuff, all the time.

362
00:17:51,403 --> 00:17:53,489
Yep, we do!
We're gonna do some right now.

363
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:54,573
We really do.

364
00:17:57,284 --> 00:17:58,827
[growling]

365
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:00,037
[Benson] Whoa.
[grunts]

366
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:02,790
Whoo!

367
00:18:02,873 --> 00:18:05,125
Benson, I thought I'd never see you again!

368
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:07,419
-[grunts]
-[laughing]

369
00:18:13,342 --> 00:18:16,595
Kipo saved me.
Just like I knew she would.

370
00:18:16,678 --> 00:18:18,263
And, no one got hurt.

371
00:18:18,347 --> 00:18:21,016
-Except the bats, right?
-Nope. No one!

372
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:23,644
I'm totally in control of my jaguar side.

373
00:18:23,727 --> 00:18:26,522
So, now I can fight Scarlemagne,
without hurting any humans.

374
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:30,609
Scarlemagne? No.
That's what the emitter's for.

375
00:18:30,692 --> 00:18:33,237
I need you to take down the Mega Monkey.

376
00:18:33,695 --> 00:18:35,906
The... Mega Monkey?

377
00:18:35,989 --> 00:18:40,828
Scarlemagne has it under his control.
You're the only one who can stop it.

378
00:18:41,203 --> 00:18:42,830
Don't let us down.

379
00:18:47,668 --> 00:18:49,378
That sure was brave of you.

380
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:52,214
You know, I've been thinking,
if you're wanting to, uh,

381
00:18:52,297 --> 00:18:54,925
take a stroll in the romance department,

382
00:18:55,008 --> 00:18:57,427
there's someone I know
who's perfect for you.

383
00:18:57,511 --> 00:18:59,555
-Really?
-Mm-hmm.

384
00:18:59,638 --> 00:19:03,976
That Wolf girl has been saying
wonderful things about you, all day.

385
00:19:06,436 --> 00:19:11,441
Oh. I mean, actually, I asked them
to say nice things about me.

386
00:19:11,525 --> 00:19:13,277
They're probably not true.

387
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,570
They're definitely not true.

388
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:17,030
-Why would you do that?
-Oh, I don't know.

389
00:19:17,114 --> 00:19:19,533
Troy's your son, and I just...
[chuckles]

390
00:19:19,616 --> 00:19:23,996
Ohh.
You know, one time my boy, Troy,

391
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:27,499
saved a bunch of grandmas
from an acid spitting Mega Mole.

392
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:29,418
-Wait, really?
-No.

393
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:31,753
But, you two would have a lot in common.

394
00:19:33,046 --> 00:19:34,173
[Wolf] What's wrong?

395
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:37,634
This whole time
I was training to save my mom,

396
00:19:37,718 --> 00:19:40,053
but I might have to fight her instead.

397
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:43,140
Maybe there's another way.

398
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:50,772
We'll be back in a few hours.
If anybody asks, I'm asleep.

399
00:19:58,197 --> 00:20:01,200
These tunnels seemed a lot shorter
on the blueprints.

400
00:20:01,283 --> 00:20:04,745
OK, he should be
keeping her right up there.

401
00:20:04,828 --> 00:20:06,163
Thanks, Roberto.

402
00:20:16,298 --> 00:20:17,466
[gasps]

403
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:21,678
[snoring]

404
00:20:35,317 --> 00:20:36,944
[grunting]

405
00:20:39,947 --> 00:20:41,281
Hi, Mom.

406
00:20:41,823 --> 00:20:43,325
[moans softly]

407
00:20:46,745 --> 00:20:49,873
It's really you, isn't it?

408
00:20:49,957 --> 00:20:51,208
[gasps]

409
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:55,128
[squealing softly]

410
00:21:00,717 --> 00:21:02,469
You look like you need this.

411
00:21:07,808 --> 00:21:08,934
Let's get you out of here.

412
00:21:09,434 --> 00:21:10,477
[squawks]

413
00:21:10,852 --> 00:21:12,312
[yelling]

414
00:21:12,396 --> 00:21:13,897
[roars]

415
00:21:15,649 --> 00:21:16,650
[grunts]

416
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:22,531
Well, isn't this my lucky night?

417
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:25,993
You must be Kipo,
the elusive burrow girl.

418
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:27,244
[grunts]

419
00:21:27,327 --> 00:21:31,498
Careful, you wouldn't
want to hurt dear old Daddy!

420
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:34,835
Dad!

421
00:21:34,918 --> 00:21:38,338
I believe this calls for a feast!

422
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:41,133
[laughing]
