[squeals]

00:00:16,015 --> 00:00:18,560
[snoring]

4
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:25,984
[Greta] Hey!

5
00:00:27,736 --> 00:00:30,196
We got the collar away from Scarlemagne.

6
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:31,239
Good.

7
00:00:32,282 --> 00:00:34,451
Now get it on the monkey.

8
00:00:34,743 --> 00:00:36,828
-[grunts]
-Quick! Get it on!

9
00:00:36,911 --> 00:00:37,829
[roars]

10
00:00:37,912 --> 00:00:38,747
[grunts]

00:00:41,499 --> 00:00:42,375

00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:45,045
[roars]

13
00:01:10,111 --> 00:01:11,738
[giggling]

14
00:01:12,822 --> 00:01:14,032
What was that?!

15
00:01:14,115 --> 00:01:15,492
Nope. Don't like it.

16
00:01:15,575 --> 00:01:18,995
Oh, man, Dave was right!
This place is haunted!

17
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:21,623
Probably by an evil spirit
that wants to kill us all.

18
00:01:21,706 --> 00:01:23,166
-Kill us all!
-Hi!

19
00:01:23,249 --> 00:01:24,084
[all screaming]

20
00:01:24,167 --> 00:01:26,169
-Ah, baby ghost!
-You said ghost!

21
00:01:26,252 --> 00:01:27,670
-[all gasp]
-Rhymes with toast!

22
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:29,005
-[all gasp]
-And with boast!

23
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:32,717
-[all scream]
-I like rhymes, and dimes, and splines.

24
00:01:33,593 --> 00:01:37,388
I'm not a ghost. Or a toast!
I'm Fun Gus!

25
00:01:38,306 --> 00:01:41,184
Look what I made!
It's a puh-terodactyl.

26
00:01:41,267 --> 00:01:42,602
I named him Joe!

27
00:01:42,685 --> 00:01:45,605
Oh, my goodness.
How cute are you!?

28
00:01:45,688 --> 00:01:47,315
Not cute, Kipo!

29
00:01:47,398 --> 00:01:48,858
Right. Focus.

30
00:01:48,942 --> 00:01:51,402
Fun Gus, where are our friends?

31
00:01:51,486 --> 00:01:53,571
Oh, you mean Bluey and Squiggle Baby Man?

32
00:01:53,655 --> 00:01:54,989
[babbling]

33
00:01:55,073 --> 00:01:56,449
Ah...
[yelps]

34
00:01:57,075 --> 00:02:00,954
We're playing!
They're my favorite new toys.

35
00:02:01,454 --> 00:02:02,705
Toys?

36
00:02:03,164 --> 00:02:04,707
[squealing]

37
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:06,000
[giggles]

38
00:02:06,084 --> 00:02:11,339
Listen, I know Dave and Mandu
are totally fun, but they're not toys.

39
00:02:11,422 --> 00:02:13,299
Could you give them back?
Please?

40
00:02:13,383 --> 00:02:16,469
No.
Wait, I mean, no, thank you!

41
00:02:16,553 --> 00:02:18,471
Listen, you over-sized mushroom.

42
00:02:18,555 --> 00:02:20,140
You better give them back right now!

43
00:02:20,223 --> 00:02:21,474
-[gasps]
-Wolf, don't!

44
00:02:22,308 --> 00:02:26,104
He's just a little kid.
Wait. I have an idea.

45
00:02:26,187 --> 00:02:28,398
Hey, do you want to read a story?

46
00:02:28,481 --> 00:02:31,401
-[gasps] A story?
-Yeah!

47
00:02:31,484 --> 00:02:34,320
My friends were about to
read us a great one.

48
00:02:34,404 --> 00:02:37,657
It's got science, equations,
facts about my parents...

49
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:38,575
[groans]

50
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:42,453
And action and adventure
and stuff that other people like, too!

51
00:02:42,537 --> 00:02:43,371
[chuckles]

52
00:02:43,454 --> 00:02:44,289
-[gasps]
-Right!

53
00:02:44,372 --> 00:02:48,042
So, if you bring our friends back,
we could all read it together!

54
00:02:48,126 --> 00:02:51,588
OK. But I wanna read it!
I'm a great reader!

55
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:56,259
"X plus 3, and then two lines
on top of each other..."

56
00:02:56,342 --> 00:02:57,510
Let's look for them.

57
00:02:57,594 --> 00:03:01,097
[Fun Gus] Where's the fun part?
Oh, here it is.

58
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:04,851
"When I told Lio about the fur,
he was surprised."

59
00:03:06,561 --> 00:03:09,397
-Did you say you grew fur?
-Yeah.

60
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:12,567
It kind of just appeared
on my arm and then poof!

61
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:17,363
-Disappeared.
-OK, that's definitely not normal.

62
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:22,035
-How do you feel?
-Strong, furry, sad about my kimchi.

63
00:03:22,118 --> 00:03:25,371
[scoffs]
Well, the kimchi part I can fix.

64
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:28,082
But the strong and furry?

65
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:31,169
Maybe it's side effects
of the genetic modification?

66
00:03:31,252 --> 00:03:32,462
[Song] Could be.

67
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:35,298
Sometimes a fetus's stem cells pass
to the mother via...

68
00:03:35,381 --> 00:03:37,675
[both]
Microchimerism! Nerd!

69
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:39,260
[both laughing]

70
00:03:39,344 --> 00:03:41,846
At least you didn't grow
a tail in the lab.

71
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:44,891
[gasps] The lab!
If it happens in front of them...

72
00:03:44,974 --> 00:03:46,309
They'll know we isolated the mutagen.

73
00:03:46,392 --> 00:03:48,853
They'll use it to turn mutes
back into animals.

74
00:03:49,979 --> 00:03:52,315
-[sighs]
-What do you wanna do?

75
00:03:52,398 --> 00:03:54,192
I'll stay home until I have the baby.

76
00:03:54,275 --> 00:03:56,361
We'll have to give them
a really good excuse though.

77
00:03:56,444 --> 00:03:59,822
-Complications with the pregnancy?
-Nah, they'll want you in the clinic.

78
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:04,619
[exclaims] I'll tell them you need to be
quarantined because you have burrow pox.

79
00:04:04,702 --> 00:04:08,206
-There's no such thing.
-I know, Dr. Oak.

80
00:04:08,289 --> 00:04:12,502
So, you can make up
all kinds of stuff about it, Dr. Oak.

81
00:04:12,585 --> 00:04:15,838
Highly contagious, fever, headache...

82
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:17,674
[Fun Gus] "...rash under the knees...
[continues reading indistinct]

83
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:19,509
Burrow pox isn't real?

84
00:04:19,592 --> 00:04:20,927
Then what happened to my mom?!

85
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:22,929
Do you think she's still alive?

86
00:04:23,012 --> 00:04:26,724
Maybe. Maybe "they" took her.
Whoever "they" are.

87
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:30,061
Do you think "they"
could be Scarlemagne and his nobles?

88
00:04:30,144 --> 00:04:32,480
I mean, he did seem to know your dad.

89
00:04:32,563 --> 00:04:35,566
Benson's onto something.
Your dad called him "Hugo".

90
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:36,901
-[grunts]
-Hi!

91
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,278
What ya guys looking for?

92
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:40,280
-[gasps]
-Were you listening to my story?

93
00:04:40,363 --> 00:04:44,117
We were!
But we were also looking for our friends.

94
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,244
But I'm not done playing with them yet.

95
00:04:46,327 --> 00:04:49,372
I haven't had anyone
to play with in so long.

96
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:52,417
Well, what if we play for Dave and Mandu!

97
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,419
-[exclaims]
-Have you ever played hide and seek?

98
00:04:54,544 --> 00:04:58,423
If we can find our friends, we win!
And you have to give them back.

99
00:04:58,506 --> 00:05:02,218
OK, but you won't win,
'cause I'm so good at hiding stuff.

100
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:03,303
Deal!

101
00:05:03,386 --> 00:05:05,305
[Fun Gus giggles]

102
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:10,310
[singsong voice] You'll never find them!
You'll never find them!

103
00:05:10,393 --> 00:05:12,895
You'll never find them!

104
00:05:13,938 --> 00:05:15,606
[hissing]

105
00:05:22,488 --> 00:05:24,991
How would you like
to go to my coronation?

106
00:05:25,074 --> 00:05:26,242
[hissing]

107
00:05:27,535 --> 00:05:29,787
Oh, don't bother answering.
Wasn't a question.

108
00:05:29,871 --> 00:05:31,080
[chuckles]

109
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:32,540
[hissing]

110
00:05:33,124 --> 00:05:36,461
[squawking]

111
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:43,051
Gerard!
Where is the collar?

112
00:05:43,426 --> 00:05:46,929
It has vanished from the spot...

113
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:49,766
-[growling]
-...from whence it came.

114
00:05:50,308 --> 00:05:53,895
She took it back.
We have to find the monkey first!

115
00:05:53,978 --> 00:05:55,730
[roaring]

116
00:05:57,356 --> 00:05:59,400
Hark! I found her!

117
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:00,693
[groans]

118
00:06:01,152 --> 00:06:02,487
[squawking]

119
00:06:10,578 --> 00:06:13,414
[softly] Dave! Mandu!

120
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:14,957
Dave, can you hear me buddy?

121
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:18,252
Look, I just want you to know,
I'm sorry I didn't believe you.

122
00:06:18,336 --> 00:06:22,090
You don't always have to be Fun Dave.
I love Old Dave, too!

123
00:06:22,173 --> 00:06:25,134
[Teen Dave]
Stop talking about your feelings. [groans]

124
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:26,677
You're so embarrassing!

125
00:06:26,761 --> 00:06:29,097
Dave!
Where are you?

126
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:31,224
[Mandu squealing]

127
00:06:31,307 --> 00:06:34,310
Mandu?
I can't see you anywhere!

128
00:06:35,186 --> 00:06:36,979
But maybe I can smell you.

129
00:06:37,522 --> 00:06:38,731
[sniffs]

130
00:06:41,526 --> 00:06:42,401
[exclaims]

131
00:06:45,446 --> 00:06:46,447
[grunts]

132
00:06:50,493 --> 00:06:51,536
There!

133
00:06:51,619 --> 00:06:53,287
[groans]
About time.

134
00:06:53,371 --> 00:06:56,165
This pig's too close.
And I need my space.

135
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:59,794
Dave! Uh... I should've listened to you.
I'm so sorry.

136
00:06:59,877 --> 00:07:03,756
You should be sorry.
I straight up told you. If you'd listen.

137
00:07:04,632 --> 00:07:08,469
-We won! Fun Gus, we won!
-Way to go, you guys!

138
00:07:08,636 --> 00:07:11,180
Now that we finished that game,
we can play another one!

139
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:13,307
No, it's time to give Dave and Mandu back!

140
00:07:13,391 --> 00:07:14,809
Not till we play Simon Says,

141
00:07:14,892 --> 00:07:17,520
and I'll be Simon
and it can be Fun Gus Says!

142
00:07:17,603 --> 00:07:18,855
Or we can play jumping!

143
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:20,648
Jump! Jump! Jump! Jump! Jump...

144
00:07:20,731 --> 00:07:23,192
There is no winning
with this kid, is there?

145
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:24,861
[Fun Gus] Jump! Jump! Jump! Jump!

146
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:27,363
[squawks]

147
00:07:34,662 --> 00:07:37,165
Ha! Stupid Mega Monkey.

148
00:07:37,248 --> 00:07:38,916
Thinks 'tis hiding.

149
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,586
[laughs]

150
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:47,133

151
00:07:51,846 --> 00:07:53,639
[laughs]

152
00:08:02,023 --> 00:08:04,859
Um... sir?

153
00:08:04,942 --> 00:08:05,776
Sir?

154
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:06,694
[squawks]

155
00:08:06,777 --> 00:08:10,656
Fun Gus says touch your nose,
Fun Gus says tickle your toes,

156
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:14,243
Fun Gus says dance in your bows,
boop-bop-beep-bop dippity doze!

157
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:15,203
[all scream]

158
00:08:15,286 --> 00:08:18,664
Ah, Fun Gus,
can you maybe calm down a little?

159
00:08:18,915 --> 00:08:21,959
Sorry! I'm just so excited!
What game is next?!

160
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:24,003
Uh...

161
00:08:24,086 --> 00:08:27,757
How about my favorite game,
"who can close their eyes the longest"?

162
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,885
-Isn't that just a nap?
-No, no, no! It's a game!

163
00:08:30,968 --> 00:08:32,220
I know that one!

164
00:08:32,303 --> 00:08:34,680
Oh, oh.
Dave and Mandu should play, too!

165
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:37,475
[gasps]
OK!

166
00:08:39,894 --> 00:08:42,563
Fine. Guess I'll play but no peeking.

167
00:08:42,647 --> 00:08:45,107
Mandu, I'm looking at you.

168
00:08:45,566 --> 00:08:50,112
Let's play a little music
to get us in the eye-closing mood.

169
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:51,572
[soft music plays]

170
00:08:51,656 --> 00:08:53,241
Psst, Dave.

171
00:08:53,616 --> 00:08:57,912
[giggles] I'm already winning...
[snoring]

172
00:08:59,664 --> 00:09:00,831
[whispers] He's asleep.

173
00:09:00,915 --> 00:09:03,584
[whispers] You guys go.
I have to keep reading.

174
00:09:03,668 --> 00:09:05,211
If this journal isn't my anchor,

175
00:09:05,294 --> 00:09:07,463
maybe it'll give me a clue
to something here that is.

176
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:09,340
We've been through this before.

177
00:09:09,423 --> 00:09:10,675
We're not leaving you, Kipo.

178
00:09:10,758 --> 00:09:12,802
Pssh, yeah.
Leaving's for losers.

179
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:13,803
We're a team.

180
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:20,059
[screams]

181
00:09:20,142 --> 00:09:23,020
[chuckles]
Dinosaurs.

182
00:09:23,104 --> 00:09:25,481
-[snores]
-He's dreaming.

183
00:09:25,982 --> 00:09:29,193
"Today I made the biggest breakthrough
of my career..."

184
00:09:32,321 --> 00:09:35,199
[exclaims]
Check it out! Secret panel!

185
00:09:35,283 --> 00:09:37,618
Oh, my goodness!
You've always wanted one of those!

186
00:09:37,702 --> 00:09:39,370
I know, right!

187
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:43,958
[laughs] I guess you're still
getting used to that super strength.

188
00:09:45,543 --> 00:09:47,128
How was work?

189
00:09:47,211 --> 00:09:50,256
Well, there were cupcakes
for Janet's birthday,

190
00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:53,926
and everyone's suspicious
of your burrow pox.

191
00:09:54,051 --> 00:09:55,177
Oh!

192
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:58,764
Well, I'd feel better about that
if you had brought me a cupcake.

193
00:09:58,848 --> 00:10:01,767
Yeah. That would've made
this next part so much easier.

194
00:10:02,351 --> 00:10:04,395
I think maybe we should leave tonight.

195
00:10:04,478 --> 00:10:05,896
Tonight?!

196
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:10,776
As in leave before I have the baby?
I can't give birth on the surface.

197
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:13,404
[pants]
It's too dangerous.

198
00:10:13,487 --> 00:10:15,239
Song, hey, Song.
Are you OK?

199
00:10:15,323 --> 00:10:17,491
-[panting]
-Song?

200
00:10:17,658 --> 00:10:20,328
[yelling]

201
00:10:20,411 --> 00:10:21,912
[crying]

202
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:26,709
Come here, sweetheart.
Come to Daddy. It's OK.

203
00:10:27,376 --> 00:10:30,004
[humming]

204
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:37,345
Sh, sh, sh, sh, sh.
It's OK, Kipo.

205
00:10:37,428 --> 00:10:39,555
-[cooing]
-She's perfect.

206
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:40,848
Just like her mom.

207
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:46,437
-Honey, look.
-Oh, good. You're seeing it, too.

208
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:48,731
I thought I was just deliriously tired.

209
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:51,108
Look at her little paw!

210
00:10:51,192 --> 00:10:53,944
-Guess we have a jaguar on our hands.
-Good thing.

211
00:10:54,028 --> 00:10:55,946
Komodo dragon
would've been hard to cuddle.

212
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:59,367
-[chuckles]
-She changes everything.

213
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:02,662
She'll makes it safe for humans
to live on the surface.

214
00:11:02,745 --> 00:11:04,163
Only if we can get her out of here.

215
00:11:04,872 --> 00:11:06,582
[snoring]

216
00:11:08,042 --> 00:11:10,211
You're right.
I'll go start packing.

217
00:11:10,294 --> 00:11:11,295
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

218
00:11:11,587 --> 00:11:13,881
I'll pack and as soon
as you're well enough,

219
00:11:13,964 --> 00:11:15,591
we'll get Hugo and go.

220
00:11:17,802 --> 00:11:19,136
Hugo?!

221
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:21,222
-That's what my dad called--
-Scarlemagne.

222
00:11:21,305 --> 00:11:24,892
If your parents were planning on
taking Scarlemagne with them...

223
00:11:24,975 --> 00:11:27,103
Then who were they running from?

224
00:11:28,312 --> 00:11:29,688
[Zane]
Dr. Emilia!

225
00:11:30,231 --> 00:11:32,733
[groans, grunts]

226
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:37,571
-That monkey packs a punch.
-Yeah.

227
00:11:37,655 --> 00:11:40,032
[groans]
She must really miss me.

228
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:43,786
The monkey was mine for 13 years.
I'm not giving up that easily.

229
00:11:43,869 --> 00:11:46,163
-Let's go.
-The dragonfly's busted.

230
00:11:46,247 --> 00:11:47,540
[buzzing]

231
00:11:47,623 --> 00:11:50,334
-It ain't flying nowhere.
-I can fix it!

232
00:11:50,418 --> 00:11:52,878
I just need another dragonfly.

233
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:55,965
Don't bother.
We go on foot.

234
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:03,722
This whole time I thought Scarlemagne
was the most evil thing out there,

235
00:12:03,806 --> 00:12:06,976
but what if he's not.
What if there's someone else?

236
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:10,146
-[screaming]
-Hey! No one else's eyes are closed!

237
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:15,067
Wait a second. Were you trying
to trick me into taking a nap?

238
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:16,944
[grunting]

239
00:12:17,653 --> 00:12:18,821
Ah!

240
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:21,532
Every version of me
thinks that kid is creepy.

241
00:12:21,615 --> 00:12:24,368
[nervous laugh]
Fun Gus, we're sorry.

242
00:12:24,452 --> 00:12:25,911
We're not trying to trick you but--

243
00:12:25,995 --> 00:12:27,830
We've just really
gotta find Kipo's anchor and...

244
00:12:27,913 --> 00:12:31,250
La, la, la, la, la!
I can't hear you!

245
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:33,252
I can't hear you!

246
00:12:33,335 --> 00:12:35,254
Uh, guys?

247
00:12:35,337 --> 00:12:37,798
-[screaming]
-What did you say Squiggle Baby Man?

248
00:12:37,882 --> 00:12:40,050
You don't want to play with them anymore?

249
00:12:40,134 --> 00:12:43,137
OK! Then we'll play alone.
Forever!

250
00:12:43,804 --> 00:12:45,806
Fun Gus, wait!
Let's play another game!

251
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:47,766
-You choose!
-Really?!

252
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:49,602
[screams]
-[grunts]

253
00:12:49,685 --> 00:12:51,645
I vote tag! Tag!

254
00:12:51,729 --> 00:12:53,272
What? You didn't say "go!"

255
00:12:53,355 --> 00:12:55,274
-[grunts]
-Double tag!

256
00:12:55,357 --> 00:12:57,693
You're supposed to let go after you tag!

257
00:12:57,776 --> 00:13:01,113
You guys tried to trick me!
Now I'm tricking you!

258
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:02,573
See how you like it!

259
00:13:03,157 --> 00:13:04,742
[yelling]

260
00:13:08,579 --> 00:13:09,497
[grunts]

261
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:11,332
You're cheating!

262
00:13:11,415 --> 00:13:13,667
[yells]

263
00:13:18,088 --> 00:13:19,798
[grunting]

264
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:36,649
[squawking]

265
00:13:37,691 --> 00:13:39,735
Don't worry.
I won't attack you.

266
00:13:39,818 --> 00:13:42,404
In fact, look around.
I'm all alone.

267
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:45,366
[grunting]

268
00:13:46,825 --> 00:13:51,163
Hmm, so you can understand me.
Magnificent.

269
00:13:51,247 --> 00:13:55,000
[grunting]

270
00:13:55,084 --> 00:14:00,089
The human who enslaved you
stole my pheromones to do it.

271
00:14:00,172 --> 00:14:01,465
[grunts]

272
00:14:01,549 --> 00:14:06,136
How would you like
to get revenge on Dr. Emilia?

273
00:14:06,637 --> 00:14:09,223
[roars]

274
00:14:09,306 --> 00:14:11,767
Yes. Join me.

275
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:15,145
We won't rest until all humans

276
00:14:15,229 --> 00:14:19,608
share the same fate
you were forced to endure!

277
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:22,069
[maniacal laughter]

278
00:14:25,614 --> 00:14:27,408
Oh. Where are you going?

279
00:14:28,909 --> 00:14:30,494
[panting]

280
00:14:30,578 --> 00:14:33,497
We have to get them out
of Lichenland, Mandu.

281
00:14:33,581 --> 00:14:34,623
But how?

282
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:36,292
-[sneezes]
-[groans]

283
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:38,127
You sneezed into my mouth!

284
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:41,714
[coughs, gasps]
Mandu, you're a genius!

285
00:14:41,797 --> 00:14:42,673
[snorts]

286
00:14:43,757 --> 00:14:45,593
Mulholland...

287
00:14:46,093 --> 00:14:48,012
Mulholland...

288
00:14:49,305 --> 00:14:52,683
[gasps] Mulholland!

289
00:14:52,766 --> 00:14:55,185
[Mulholland]
Kipo! Kipo!

290
00:14:56,228 --> 00:14:58,272
Kipo! Kipo!

291
00:14:58,355 --> 00:15:00,608
-You came!
-Of course, I did.

292
00:15:00,691 --> 00:15:03,235
This is the first time
someone's invited me over!

293
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:06,739
Hmm? Do you think that's because
I used to feed on brain energy?

294
00:15:06,822 --> 00:15:08,240
Yes. Yes, I do.

295
00:15:08,324 --> 00:15:10,784
[explosion noise]
Mind blown.

296
00:15:10,868 --> 00:15:13,495
This self-discovery journey
is a real trip.

297
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:17,124
-Anywoos, what can I do for ya?
-So glad you asked!

298
00:15:17,207 --> 00:15:20,169
Are you ready to take your journey
to the next step?

299
00:15:20,252 --> 00:15:21,962
Because I really need your help!

300
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:25,174
[straining]

301
00:15:25,257 --> 00:15:27,718
Mary, pour me some tea please?

302
00:15:27,801 --> 00:15:31,805
-I think that's you, Wolf.
-No. There isn't anything there!

303
00:15:31,889 --> 00:15:34,099
Mary, use your imagination!

304
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:36,518
[slurps] Ah!

305
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:40,481
-Aw, I spilled!
-Uh, what are you doing here?

306
00:15:40,564 --> 00:15:43,567
If I can't take my friends with me,
I'm staying.

307
00:15:43,651 --> 00:15:46,487
-We're a team.
-Yay, team!

308
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:48,322
My forever friends!

309
00:15:48,405 --> 00:15:53,369
More tea for Mary and no more cream

310
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:54,787
for Squiggle Baby Man.

311
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:56,747
Keep sleepin', lil' lichey.

312
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:58,749

00:16:02,211 --> 00:16:04,296
Boy, am I glad to see you!

316
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:06,507
Whoo! It stunk in there!
What does he eat?

317
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:07,925
Let's get out of here.

318
00:16:08,008 --> 00:16:11,220
-[grunting]
-This little fellas catching on.

319
00:16:12,846 --> 00:16:14,306
I can't hold him--

320
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:15,683
Much longer!

321
00:16:15,766 --> 00:16:16,809
-[cooing]
-Take the picture!

322
00:16:16,892 --> 00:16:17,768
I'm trying!

323
00:16:17,851 --> 00:16:19,937
It's hard to take
a picture of yourself with this.

324
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:21,563
[cooing]

325
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:27,069
Aw, look how cute Mom and baby are.

326
00:16:27,152 --> 00:16:31,991
[sighs] I wish I could frame this picture,
but no one can ever see it.

327
00:16:32,741 --> 00:16:35,536
I'll break into the lab tonight for Hugo.
Then we leave.

328
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:39,248
[knocking at door]

329
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:44,211
-[gasps] Lio.
-OK.

330
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:48,298
New plan, we leave now.
End of plan.

331
00:16:48,382 --> 00:16:51,719
-Take Kipo and get out of here.
-No! We are not leaving you.

332
00:16:51,802 --> 00:16:53,554
-Not like this.
-You have to.

333
00:16:53,637 --> 00:16:56,473
Kipo's the most important thing
in the world.

334
00:16:56,557 --> 00:16:59,184
I'll be fine.
Super strength.

335
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:01,979
OK.
You know where to find us.

336
00:17:02,062 --> 00:17:04,231
[knocking continues]

337
00:17:05,607 --> 00:17:07,276
I love you both.

Thanks, Mulholland.
We couldn't have gotten away without you.

I had no idea
helping could be so fulfilling.

351
00:18:02,372 --> 00:18:06,710
If you ever need me, Kipo and Co.,
just call into the water again.

352
00:18:06,794 --> 00:18:11,507
Helping is so cool!
Super cool.

Oh, thank goodness!

Wait a second.
