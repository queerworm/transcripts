177
00:07:49,051 --> 00:07:49,886
Who would do that?

178
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:55,099
[sobbing] The Newton Wolves!

179
00:07:55,183 --> 00:07:58,352
Guess it wasn't enough
that they ate Boom-Boom!

180
00:07:58,436 --> 00:08:01,522
[crying] This one's for you, Boom-Boom!

181
00:08:02,857 --> 00:08:05,359
[happy gasp] This one's also for you,
Boom-Boom

182
00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:07,778
Dave, you don't even know her.

183
00:08:07,862 --> 00:08:10,698
But I got to throw a bomb.
Don't take this away from me.

184
00:08:10,781 --> 00:08:13,201
Why would the Newton Wolves eat Boom-Boom?

185
00:08:13,284 --> 00:08:15,161
[sniffs] It's the way things are.

186
00:08:15,244 --> 00:08:18,289
Wolves are vicious.
They did it for no reason!

187
00:08:18,372 --> 00:08:21,751
Yeah! Right after
we pooped on their new telescope.

188
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:25,463
The next morning, boom!
Boom-Boom was gone.

189
00:08:25,546 --> 00:08:27,840
Wait, you didn't actually
<i>see </i>them take her?

190
00:08:27,924 --> 00:08:30,551
Never saw ‘em come, never saw ‘em leave.

191
00:08:30,635 --> 00:08:35,181
Life is but a walking shadow. [sobs]

192
00:08:35,264 --> 00:08:39,894
Two mutes are missing
under mysterious circumstances.

193
00:08:39,977 --> 00:08:43,731
They're blaming the wolves,
but I think somebody else

194
00:08:43,814 --> 00:08:46,776
is behind all these disappearances.

195
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:47,693
-Emilia.
-Emilia.

196
00:08:47,777 --> 00:08:49,862
Emilia!

197
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:56,118
[Newton Wolves snarling]

198
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:58,037
Hey-hey, we're just here to talk.

199
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:03,376
You may have saved our lives at Aurum,
but we didn't forget about the telescope,

200
00:09:03,459 --> 00:09:05,920
or the fact that you're part, ugh, cat.

201
00:09:06,003 --> 00:09:07,255
[yells]

202
00:09:08,589 --> 00:09:10,132
[grunting]

203
00:09:12,718 --> 00:09:14,345
You're lucky Billions is working.

204
00:09:14,428 --> 00:09:16,055
Leave me to my research!

205
00:09:16,138 --> 00:09:18,474
[sighs] He's trying to prove

206
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:21,852
that dark matter exists
inside those moon rocks.

207
00:09:21,936 --> 00:09:23,437
Science is weird.

208
00:09:23,521 --> 00:09:25,523
What do you want, Kipo?

209
00:09:25,606 --> 00:09:26,899
We're looking for Boom-Boom,

210
00:09:26,983 --> 00:09:28,568
and the HummingBombers
think you ate her.

211
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:30,778
Ha! First, they soil our new telescope,

212
00:09:30,861 --> 00:09:32,405
and now they're spreading lies!

213
00:09:32,488 --> 00:09:35,992
[Bad Billions] We are predators!
But lately, I feel like prey!

214
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:39,036
So, you didn't eat Boom-Boom?

215
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,913
How ‘bout Camille? She's a snake.

216
00:09:40,997 --> 00:09:42,498
Yes! Led with snake.

217
00:09:43,374 --> 00:09:45,668
No. The last person we ate was--
Was it Jeff?

218
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:49,839
Yeah. Jeff. Jeff the squirrel.
But Jeff was three days ago.

219
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:52,300
And now I'm feeling peckish.

220
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:55,386
[snarling]

221
00:09:55,469 --> 00:09:59,223
So. A snake is missing.
A bird is also missing.

222
00:09:59,932 --> 00:10:02,727
Does a wolf happen to be missing?

223
00:10:03,144 --> 00:10:03,978
No.

224
00:10:04,061 --> 00:10:06,731
Dang it! I mean, uh, good!

225
00:10:06,814 --> 00:10:09,108
[grunting]
Someone did steal our centrifuge.

226
00:10:09,191 --> 00:10:11,068
Oh. My. Gosh!

227
00:10:11,152 --> 00:10:13,029
What. Is. That?

228
00:10:13,112 --> 00:10:17,116
A machine that creates high
centrifugal forces to separate particles!

229
00:10:17,199 --> 00:10:20,119
Which you would need
if you're perfecting a genetic cure!

230
00:10:20,202 --> 00:10:22,955
I know who stole your centrifuge!

231
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:25,416
[scoffs] So do we. The Timbercats.

232
00:10:25,499 --> 00:10:28,419
Wait, what?
The Timbercats would never!

233
00:10:28,502 --> 00:10:30,671
[Bad Billions]
It is an established scientific fact

234
00:10:30,755 --> 00:10:32,506
that cats like spinny things!

235
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:34,925
No. I'm sure it was Dr. Emilia!

236
00:10:35,009 --> 00:10:38,888
Dr. Emilia? Do you mean
that fake villain from that weird play?

237
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:40,431
[Bad Billions] I love that play.

238
00:10:40,514 --> 00:10:42,516
That frog's voice made me feel things!

239
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,476
Oh, she's real.

240
00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:45,394
Yeah, she's a nightmare.

241
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:47,146
And if you come back to Timbercat Village,

242
00:10:47,229 --> 00:10:49,357
I can prove that the cats
didn't steal from you.

243
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,817
If I'm wrong,
I help you get your stuff back.

244
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:55,863
If I'm right, you join HMUFA
and we get your stuff back together.

245
00:10:58,157 --> 00:10:59,158
[snoring]

246
00:11:01,118 --> 00:11:04,080
[Kipo]
Welcome! I've invited you all here

247
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:07,750
to the first ever meeting of HMUFA!

248
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:09,210
[inhales]

249
00:11:09,293 --> 00:11:11,712
The Human Mute Ultimate
Friendship Alliance!

250
00:11:12,838 --> 00:11:14,006
[hisses]

251
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:16,384
OK, first up, the secret handshake!

252
00:11:16,467 --> 00:11:19,011
It starts as a simple high-five,
but then--

253
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:21,389
You'd better just get right to it, Kipo.

254
00:11:21,472 --> 00:11:22,640
Yeah, where's Camille?

255
00:11:22,723 --> 00:11:25,559
Do you know how hard it is to play
without a lead guitarist?

256
00:11:25,643 --> 00:11:26,852
Where's Boom-Boom?

257
00:11:26,936 --> 00:11:28,938
Hand over our centrifuge!

258
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:30,147
Who shed in my chair?

259
00:11:30,231 --> 00:11:31,774
[indistinct yelling]

260
00:11:34,443 --> 00:11:35,486
[Mega Jaguar roars]

261
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:41,450
[Mega Jaguar's head thuds]

262
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:42,952
[roars]

263
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:43,994
Everything's fine.

264
00:11:44,453 --> 00:11:47,164
So, obviously,
we need to clear a few things up.

265
00:11:47,248 --> 00:11:50,501
You're all blaming each other,
but you're all innocent.

266
00:11:50,584 --> 00:11:52,753
The HummingBombers didn't take Camille,

267
00:11:52,837 --> 00:11:55,005
the Newton Wolves didn't eat Boom-Boom,

268
00:11:55,089 --> 00:11:57,675
and the Timbercats
didn't steal the centrifuge.

269
00:11:57,758 --> 00:11:58,717
Uh, Kipo?

270
00:11:58,801 --> 00:12:00,845
Not now. I'm kinda
in the middle of something.

271
00:12:00,928 --> 00:12:03,347
-So, you see--
-We absolutely took it.

272
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:04,765
I'm sorry, what's that?

273
00:12:04,849 --> 00:12:07,309
We took it. The center fudge.

274
00:12:08,144 --> 00:12:10,020
[stammers] What-- Why?

275
00:12:10,104 --> 00:12:11,689
e used it in the unraveling.

276
00:12:11,772 --> 00:12:13,149
And the re-raveling.

277
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:15,609
And then, we just watched it spin.

278
00:12:15,693 --> 00:12:17,653
[giggles] It was so spinny.

279
00:12:17,736 --> 00:12:20,281
I knew it! Cats like spinny things!

280
00:12:20,364 --> 00:12:22,950
Billions,
I'm about to make like the Big Bang,

281
00:12:23,033 --> 00:12:25,453
expand into a high-temperature state,
and explode!

282
00:12:25,536 --> 00:12:27,580
Hey! Exploding is<i> our </i>thing!

283
00:12:27,663 --> 00:12:31,083
First you steal Boom-Boom
and now you steal our thing?

284
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:34,503
Just stop stealing, period!

285
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:35,963
What is wrong with you all?

286
00:12:36,046 --> 00:12:37,506
Sorry I'm late. What did I miss?

287
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:39,508
-I will end you!
-[indistinct yelling]

288
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:40,509
Uh-oh.

289
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:41,886
This is about to get ugly.

290
00:12:41,969 --> 00:12:45,139
So, why did you feathered freaks
bomb our club?

291
00:12:45,222 --> 00:12:48,434
Oh, we didn't. But if we did,
we'd be doing the world a favor!

292
00:12:48,517 --> 00:12:49,351
[hisses]

293
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:51,979
HummingBombers, in formation!

294
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:56,984
By Einstein's slide-rule,
we shall mop the floor with you.

295
00:12:57,067 --> 00:12:59,862
Wait! This is what Dr. Emilia wants!

296
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:02,573
If you have to fight someone, fight her!

297
00:13:02,656 --> 00:13:04,867
O-- Or at least let me
show you the handshake!

298
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:07,036
Sorry, Kipo. Your words are good,

299
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:09,872
but not as good as settling things
with tooth and claw.

300
00:13:09,955 --> 00:13:12,500
All right!
You're in our house, so here's the rules!

301
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:14,418
There are no rules! Ah!

302
00:13:14,502 --> 00:13:15,503
-[hissing]
-[barking]

303
00:13:15,586 --> 00:13:16,462
[growling]

304
00:13:18,714 --> 00:13:20,633
[chomping, growling]

305
00:13:20,716 --> 00:13:23,594
Why are you looking at me like that,
Mandu?

306
00:13:23,677 --> 00:13:26,263
-[squeals]
-Why?

307
00:13:26,347 --> 00:13:27,515
[distant fighting]

308
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:31,477
I just made everything worse, didn't I?

309
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,562
Kipo, don't be so hard on yourself.

310
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:35,439
They wanted to fight each other anyway.

311
00:13:35,523 --> 00:13:37,399
You just put them all in the same room.

312
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:40,986
I just had to pull Troy's sleight-of-hand
arm out of a snake's mouth!

313
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:43,948
It might be time to consider
that HMUFA won't work.

314
00:13:44,031 --> 00:13:48,369
I think the Alliance was a beautiful dream
that the world just isn't ready for.

315
00:13:49,703 --> 00:13:52,831
No. We need help to stop Dr. Emilia.

316
00:13:52,915 --> 00:13:55,918
Kipo's right. It's been months,
and we're no closer to finding her.

317
00:13:56,001 --> 00:13:59,421
She'll have the cure any day now,
and then she'll be unstoppable.

318
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:01,173
Ohh, I<i> hate </i>that woman!

319
00:14:01,257 --> 00:14:02,967
We stopped Scarlemagne by ourselves.

320
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:05,010
We can find a way to stop Emilia, too.

321
00:14:05,094 --> 00:14:07,221
We will protect them from the cure--

322
00:14:07,304 --> 00:14:08,222
Ah!

323
00:14:08,305 --> 00:14:09,139
[crash]

324
00:14:09,223 --> 00:14:12,810
Even if we can't protect them
from themselves.

325
00:14:12,893 --> 00:14:17,064
[yawns] So, is it OK
if I get some sleep now?

326
00:14:17,147 --> 00:14:20,568
Yeah. It's been a long night.
You guys get some rest.

327
00:14:20,651 --> 00:14:22,945
I should try to break that up.

328
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:24,238
See you all bright and early.

329
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:27,324
HMUF-- ee,

330
00:14:27,408 --> 00:14:29,869
well, I guess just "yay us."

331
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:34,248
Why don't ya come back home?

332
00:14:34,331 --> 00:14:37,334
Something tells me you're
not going to be able to fix that tonight.

333
00:14:37,418 --> 00:14:39,962
Question is, can I fix it at all?

334
00:14:41,171 --> 00:14:42,673
[distant fighting]

335
00:14:42,756 --> 00:14:44,341
[hisses]

336
00:14:50,764 --> 00:14:52,057
[fighting continues]

337
00:14:55,811 --> 00:14:57,938
Hmm. Sounds like it
isn't going too well down there.

338
00:14:58,022 --> 00:14:59,106
Oh, no.

339
00:14:59,189 --> 00:15:02,443
The secret handshake didn't fix
two hundred years of malcontent?

340
00:15:02,526 --> 00:15:04,862
Shocking. [laughs]

341
00:15:04,945 --> 00:15:06,071
Go ahead and laugh.

342
00:15:06,155 --> 00:15:09,116
But if Dr. Emilia succeeds,
you disappear, too.

343
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:11,118
Fine. Here's some advice.

344
00:15:11,201 --> 00:15:12,119
Didn't ask for any.

345
00:15:12,202 --> 00:15:13,120
Too bad.

346
00:15:13,203 --> 00:15:16,415
I'm stuck here with my thoughts,
and you're the only one who visits.

347
00:15:16,498 --> 00:15:18,751
If you need the Mutes
to help you with Emilia,

348
00:15:18,834 --> 00:15:20,044
make them fear you.

349
00:15:20,711 --> 00:15:21,545
No!

350
00:15:21,629 --> 00:15:23,964
It's the only way
to get them to work together.

351
00:15:24,048 --> 00:15:27,176
They're savage brutes.
They either dominate or cower.

352
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:29,553
The Mega Jaguar could get them in line.

353
00:15:29,637 --> 00:15:32,389
I don't want to do that.
I want them to want to help me.

354
00:15:32,473 --> 00:15:33,974
I-- I'm not you.

355
00:15:34,683 --> 00:15:37,853
Well, good luck protecting them
with high-fives and a smile, then.

356
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:40,689
Wait. You didn't give me my food.

357
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:42,691
Put it in the slot, please.

358
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:46,445
[hinges squeak]

359
00:15:46,528 --> 00:15:48,530
Ugh! Pancakes again?

360
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:50,199
Are you serious?

361
00:15:50,282 --> 00:15:52,159
Don't you people eat anything else?

362
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:02,294
[mute kids laughing]

363
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:04,380
[gasps]

364
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:06,840
[Benson] Ugh, Kipo.

365
00:16:06,924 --> 00:16:08,884
I was in the middle of a great dream.

366
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:10,302
Troy sawed a lady in half

367
00:16:10,386 --> 00:16:12,763
and now I'll never know
if he magic'd her back together.

368
00:16:12,846 --> 00:16:14,390
I hate cliffhangers.

369
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:15,599
Guys, look!

370
00:16:15,683 --> 00:16:19,228
Scrumples is It! [laughing]

371
00:16:21,063 --> 00:16:23,399
So, it starts with a high-five--
heeyaw--

372
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:25,317
But then you bump elbows--
[grunts]

373
00:16:25,401 --> 00:16:28,445
and then you turn around
and bump tails-- Yaw!

374
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:30,698
Eee! Secret handshake!

375
00:16:30,781 --> 00:16:32,032
Oh, I'm seeing it.

376
00:16:32,116 --> 00:16:34,743
[Kipo] Their parents
are all sworn enemies, but they're not!

377
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:36,578
Can't believe I'm about to say this...

378
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:38,580
maybe we should give HMUFA another shot.

379
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:39,707
You know what this means?

380
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:42,001
Maybe that is how things are,

381
00:16:42,084 --> 00:16:44,044
but this is how things could be.

382
00:16:44,128 --> 00:16:45,379
[mute kids laughing]

383
00:16:45,462 --> 00:16:48,382
Wow. I heard that here and here.

384
00:16:48,465 --> 00:16:51,677
I think HMUFA is bigger than
just stopping Dr. Emilia.

385
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,470
It's a forever thing.

386
00:16:53,554 --> 00:16:54,430
[gasps]

387
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:56,765
It's HMUF-FA!

388
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:58,350
Wait. That sounds weird.

389
00:16:58,434 --> 00:17:00,060
Let's make the second F silent.

390
00:17:00,144 --> 00:17:01,562
But it stands for forever.

391
00:17:01,645 --> 00:17:03,981
So, it's the high-five,
and then under the leg,

392
00:17:04,064 --> 00:17:05,232
and-- what was after that?

393
00:17:05,315 --> 00:17:06,859
Um, back flip.

394
00:17:06,942 --> 00:17:09,153
OK. [grunts]

395
00:17:09,236 --> 00:17:11,447

-[bang]
-Whoa!

397
00:17:12,531 --> 00:17:13,365
What was that?

398
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:16,452
It was probably just Kipo's mom
getting up to stretch her legs.

399
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:17,661
I wouldn't worry about it--

402
00:17:20,622 --> 00:17:23,375
Mega Crab!
Where'd that thing come from?

403
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:25,127
Someone do something!

404
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:26,628
Kipo, that's your job.

405
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:27,755
Right-right-right-right-right.

406
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:29,089

[thuds]

416
00:17:54,823 --> 00:17:56,950
I've never seen anything like this before.

417
00:17:57,034 --> 00:17:58,202
Yeah, good luck with that.

418
00:17:58,285 --> 00:18:01,413
We'll leave<i> you </i>to deal with<i> your </i>crabs.

[HummingBombers laughing]

420
00:18:03,373 --> 00:18:06,168
Cowards! What about you?
You're not gonna run off?

421
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:08,087
I don't run away from a fight.

422
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:10,672
Yumyan protects you all!

423
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:12,132
How are we gonna fight a Mega Crab?

425
00:18:13,717 --> 00:18:16,220
Wait! We can use this.

00:18:16,303 --> 00:18:18,847
[gasps] How dare you!

00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:21,391
[grunts, groans]

428
00:18:21,475 --> 00:18:24,812
Fine. Yumyan loans you yarn.

Yah! Yah!

00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:00,764
Thanks, Snake.

438
00:19:00,848 --> 00:19:02,349
Don't mention it, Cat.

00:19:02,432 --> 00:19:03,267

Everyone, I have an announcement!

461
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:14,296
The HMUFA, which we all agree isn't crazy,
has new members.

462
00:20:14,379 --> 00:20:15,797
You'll never believe who.

463
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:17,424
Duh, it's us!

[mutes cheer]

465
00:20:19,176 --> 00:20:21,929
First order of business,
we'll help you find Camille.

466
00:20:22,012 --> 00:20:25,515
Until then, Yumyan babysits you all!

00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:35,734
[gasps] Look!
Mandu's tusks are coming in.

471
00:20:35,817 --> 00:20:37,361
She's teething!

472
00:20:37,444 --> 00:20:40,113
So,<i> that's </i>why she's been cranky all day.

473
00:20:40,197 --> 00:20:42,532
I was really convinced
it was all Dave's fault, somehow.

474
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:45,327
This is delicious.

475
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:48,080
But what was all this seafood
doing in the forest?

476
00:20:48,163 --> 00:20:50,499
Yeah, I saw another crab
by the highway earlier

477
00:20:50,582 --> 00:20:52,459
when we were looking for-- [gasps]

478
00:20:54,836 --> 00:20:57,256
Were you gonna say something else?

479
00:20:57,339 --> 00:21:00,592
What's the only thing that could drive
Mega crabs from their homes?

480
00:21:00,676 --> 00:21:01,760
A sonic emitter.

481
00:21:01,843 --> 00:21:04,972
That's why we haven't been able
to find Dr. Emilia on the surface.

482
00:21:05,055 --> 00:21:06,431
Because she's at sea!

483

[panting]

484
00:21:08,058 --> 00:21:09,268
Puck, what is it?

485
00:21:09,351 --> 00:21:11,728
A most dastardly development, I'm afraid.

486
00:21:11,812 --> 00:21:12,813
It's Jamack!

487
00:21:12,896 --> 00:21:15,774
During the scuffle
with the mega crustacea, he went missing.

488
00:21:15,857 --> 00:21:18,527
We found this on the forest floor.

489
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:20,153
I fear the worst.

490
00:21:20,237 --> 00:21:23,198
Kipo. What if she's
not just kidnapping Mutes?

491
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:25,158
What if she's gathering test subjects?

492
00:21:25,242 --> 00:21:27,452
What if she's close to finding the cure?

493
00:21:27,536 --> 00:21:29,037
And she has our friends!
