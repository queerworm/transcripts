00:00:39,622 --> 00:00:41,791
Wolf! Stop!
[panting]

8
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:44,878
So, Kipo's part mute.
We all have secrets.

9
00:00:44,961 --> 00:00:47,255
That one's just a little bigger.

10
00:00:47,338 --> 00:00:48,465
[grunts]

11
00:00:49,924 --> 00:00:51,468
[panting]

12
00:00:53,553 --> 00:00:56,639
Her legs are so short.
How is she so fast?!

13
00:01:17,118 --> 00:01:19,120
[straining]

14
00:01:19,996 --> 00:01:23,958
Let us go!
This is not a good time to get kidnapped!

15
00:01:24,042 --> 00:01:25,710
We're kinda in the middle of something.

16
00:01:25,794 --> 00:01:27,587
[scoffs]
Oh, sorry about that.

17
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:29,923
Hop off anywhere you like.

18
00:01:30,006 --> 00:01:33,384
[gasps] Fine, land and then let us go.

19
00:01:33,468 --> 00:01:35,345
And then what, burrow girl?

20
00:01:35,428 --> 00:01:37,931
Every mute in the city is after you.

21
00:01:38,014 --> 00:01:39,849
What?
Why would they be after me?

22
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:42,977
Scarlemagne.
He knows where you're from,

23
00:01:43,061 --> 00:01:45,772
and that you can lead him
to your dirt-loving humans.

24
00:01:45,855 --> 00:01:48,817
With them, he'll have an army
large enough to conquer the surface.

25
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:52,570
Whoever hands you over gets to live
in his palace, wear fancy clothes,

26
00:01:52,654 --> 00:01:55,490
and be the second most-powerful
mute in the city.

27
00:01:55,573 --> 00:01:58,034
Let's just say I've already
sent my measurements.

28
00:01:58,118 --> 00:02:01,996
You wouldn't hand me to Scarlemagne.
Deep down you know it's wrong.

29
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:05,792
-I saved your life!
-Oh, what? From the Newton Wolves?

30
00:02:05,875 --> 00:02:08,503
I would've escaped on my own.
Eventually.

31
00:02:08,586 --> 00:02:11,381
Really? 'Cause the way I remember it,
you were all,

32
00:02:11,464 --> 00:02:16,136
"Oh, woe is me. I am to die here alone
with the burrow girl."

33
00:02:16,219 --> 00:02:18,388
And I was all,
"I'm gonna bust you outta here."

34
00:02:18,513 --> 00:02:21,015
"I'm gonna bust you out of here."
Face the facts!

35
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:24,727
It's a mute-eat-mute world up here.
And you're a human.

36
00:02:24,853 --> 00:02:27,730
You sound just like my friend, Wolf,
except she's more of a,

37
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:30,483
"Humans rule, mutes drool" kinda gal.

38
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:35,280
-And I'm like, "Can't we all rule?"
-Well, you sound like a headache!

39
00:02:35,363 --> 00:02:36,823
So...
[chokes]

40
00:02:39,617 --> 00:02:40,869
[grunts]

41
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:52,714
[panting]

42
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:56,926
Man, I am way out of shape.

43
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:59,470
Are you doing cardio
when we're asleep or something?

44
00:02:59,554 --> 00:03:00,430
[yells]

45
00:03:00,513 --> 00:03:02,473
Turn back now, before you get lost.

46
00:03:02,557 --> 00:03:04,767
Look, I get where you're coming from.

47
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:07,562
I'm a surface person,
you're a surface person.

48
00:03:07,645 --> 00:03:10,315
We're the same.
We're survivors.

49
00:03:10,398 --> 00:03:13,067
And Kipo?
She looks at an erupting volcano

50
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:15,403
and sees a fountain of rainbows
and teddy bears.

51
00:03:15,486 --> 00:03:17,822
-What's a teddy bear?
-Exactly!

52
00:03:17,906 --> 00:03:20,158
I know it's weird that she's part mute,

53
00:03:20,241 --> 00:03:23,036
or turning into a mute,
or whatever's happening,

54
00:03:23,119 --> 00:03:25,330
but she's still Kipo!

55
00:03:25,622 --> 00:03:28,291
You're not really gonna bail on her,
are you?

56
00:03:28,374 --> 00:03:29,459
[gasps]

57
00:03:34,422 --> 00:03:37,342
Are we sure the burrow girl
and her friends are down here?

58
00:03:37,425 --> 00:03:39,385
They aren't on the road,
so keep searching.

59
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:43,514
Nobody hands them to Scarlemagne
but the Scooter Skunks!

60
00:03:48,603 --> 00:03:52,732
Scarlemagne is after us?!
This is bad. Real bad.

61
00:03:52,815 --> 00:03:56,069
Even worse than that smell.
Wow, those skunks are ripe.

62
00:03:56,152 --> 00:03:58,696
He's after you.
There's no "us".

63
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:00,990
-I'm getting out of here.
-Seriously?

64
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:04,118
We were this close
to getting Kipo back to her father.

65
00:04:04,202 --> 00:04:06,913
We could see the second clover
from the trash canyon.

66
00:04:06,996 --> 00:04:08,414
We have to go back there!

67
00:04:08,498 --> 00:04:10,792
[squealing]

68
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:11,834
Mandu?

69
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:13,419
[squealing]

70
00:04:13,503 --> 00:04:14,587
I don't speak squeal!

71
00:04:14,671 --> 00:04:17,090
-[snorts]
-Oh, no.

72
00:04:17,173 --> 00:04:19,884
You don't think one of those mutes
got Kipo and Dave?

73
00:04:19,968 --> 00:04:22,804
-We've gotta help them!
-I don't "gotta" do anything

74
00:04:22,887 --> 00:04:25,556
but survive long enough
to get out of this death trap.

75
00:04:26,975 --> 00:04:29,852
I won't be hunted over a couple of mutes.

76
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:31,771
Maybe you've never had a friend before,

77
00:04:31,854 --> 00:04:33,731
but this is not how friends
treat each other!

78
00:04:37,402 --> 00:04:39,904
[growling]

79
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:44,158

[growls]

83
00:04:59,173 --> 00:05:01,384
She hasn't made much progress.

84
00:05:01,467 --> 00:05:04,887
We only found her a year ago.
Give her time.

85
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:06,597
[growling]

86
00:05:30,413 --> 00:05:31,914
[grunting]

87
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:37,253
[laughing]

88
00:05:41,591 --> 00:05:43,885
[Kipo] Yeah, and then,
and then she just ran off.

89
00:05:43,968 --> 00:05:45,970
After everything we'd been through!

90
00:05:46,054 --> 00:05:49,474
We faced a Mega Monkey,
fought a two-beaked bird,

91
00:05:49,557 --> 00:05:51,100
braided each other's hair...

92
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:54,020
OK, we haven't braided each other's hair,
but it's gonna happen.

93
00:05:54,103 --> 00:05:57,607
And now she's willing to throw
all those good things away just because...

94
00:05:57,690 --> 00:05:59,984
Well, one thing that isn't even my fault!

95
00:06:00,068 --> 00:06:03,571
Oh, boo-hoo!
So, your friend ran off on you.

96
00:06:03,654 --> 00:06:04,906
At least she didn't snip your tie

97
00:06:04,989 --> 00:06:07,784
and kick you out of the only home
you've ever known!

98
00:06:08,659 --> 00:06:12,163
Man, that sounds rough.
Wanna talk about it?

99
00:06:12,246 --> 00:06:14,499
No! No more talking!

100
00:06:14,582 --> 00:06:16,084
[sighs]

101
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:22,882
-Uh, Jamack?
-I said no more talk-- Huh?

102
00:06:23,508 --> 00:06:26,677
-Knock-knock, Jamack!
-Oh, it's you two.

103
00:06:26,761 --> 00:06:29,180
Nice try, but the burrow girl is mine!

104
00:06:29,263 --> 00:06:31,849
Oh, you know we're gonna
take her from you.

105
00:06:31,933 --> 00:06:36,687
We've got the Mod Frogs at our back,
and all you've got is a stolen dragonfly.

106
00:06:36,771 --> 00:06:39,482
Also, your tie is uneven.

107
00:06:39,565 --> 00:06:41,400
[laughing]

108
00:06:41,484 --> 00:06:43,111
[grunts]

109
00:06:43,694 --> 00:06:44,862
[yelps]

110
00:06:44,946 --> 00:06:47,698
Sounds like you guys
are dealing with some rough stuff.

111
00:06:47,782 --> 00:06:49,617
Maybe we should all land
and talk this out?

112
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:51,494
Fat chance!
[grunts]

113
00:06:52,328 --> 00:06:54,372
[screaming]

114
00:07:00,962 --> 00:07:02,088
Oh, give it up, Jamack!

115
00:07:02,171 --> 00:07:05,133
You've been a loser
since you were a tadpole.

116
00:07:05,216 --> 00:07:07,093
Hey! That's not fair!

117
00:07:07,176 --> 00:07:10,179
He managed to get me this far
all by himself.

118
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:15,435
-That's gotta count for something!
-Wait, are you and the human pals?

119
00:07:15,518 --> 00:07:16,936
[laughing]

120
00:07:17,019 --> 00:07:19,355
-Goodness!
-Would you stop defending me!

121
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:22,608

124
00:07:33,327 --> 00:07:36,372
[chuckles]
I still have the old magic.

125
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:37,957
You sure do.

126
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:39,500
[grunts]

127
00:07:44,672 --> 00:07:46,674
C'mon, we gotta warn the others!

128
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:50,428
Ooh, nice try, burrow girl,
but you forget,

129
00:07:50,511 --> 00:07:55,308
you're at the bottom of the food chain.
And I plan on going to the top.

130
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:58,060

131

[groans]

133
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:15,495
Ew, why is it so dark and dusty?
I'm not scared, it's just weird!

134
00:08:16,078 --> 00:08:18,498
[sneezes]

135
00:08:18,581 --> 00:08:19,582
Whoa!

136
00:08:20,124 --> 00:08:24,253
Nobody freak out, but I think
we fell into a Mega Bunny warren.

137
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:27,131
[whimpering]
Not the bunnies. Not again.

138
00:08:27,215 --> 00:08:31,636
Oh! Look at that snuggly
little snoozy bunny-face.

139
00:08:31,719 --> 00:08:34,972
[gasps] No, we can't pet it.
Remember what happened last time.

140
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:36,557
Unless we wash our hands?

141
00:08:36,641 --> 00:08:39,936
No! Resist the urge to pet.

142
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:41,729
[rumbling]

143
00:08:45,983 --> 00:08:47,735
[gasps]
What do we do?! Where do we go?!

144
00:08:47,818 --> 00:08:50,196
We bury ourselves!
It's the only way.

145
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:52,740
Whoa, this dude is full-on freaking out.

146
00:08:52,823 --> 00:08:55,576
[Jamack] No, it's too late.
Hole is my home now!

147
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:57,828
[groans, sighs]

[whimpering]

150
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:11,467
I'm just gonna say
what we're all thinkin'.

151
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:13,094
This dirt tastes good.

152
00:09:13,469 --> 00:09:14,428
Come on!

153
00:09:18,015 --> 00:09:20,893
Man, they stopped making these
200 years ago.

154
00:09:20,977 --> 00:09:22,395
Do you know what I had to do to get 'em?

155
00:09:22,478 --> 00:09:24,814
Stop following me.
You're gonna get us caught.

156
00:09:24,897 --> 00:09:26,983
Stop running and we can keep up.

157
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:29,235
Aw, come on.

Six o'clock!

160
00:09:41,038 --> 00:09:42,832
Eyes peeled for bogeys.

161
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:54,427
I say we drop some nectar-bombs.

162
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:56,345
Smoke 'em out of whatever hole
they're hiding in!

163
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:57,555
You think this is a toy?

164
00:09:57,638 --> 00:09:59,932
One slip and we're a Sunday roast.

165
00:10:02,393 --> 00:10:03,978
There's nothing here.

166
00:10:04,061 --> 00:10:06,188
Humming Bombers, let's fly!

00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:16,699
-Whoo! That was close.
-That was stupid! We could have died.

170
00:10:16,782 --> 00:10:19,285
Just go away.
I can survive on my own.

171
00:10:19,368 --> 00:10:21,287
Aren't you tired of just surviving?

172
00:10:21,704 --> 00:10:23,247
Obviously, you can handle yourself.

173
00:10:23,331 --> 00:10:25,583
I mean, you just jumped over
a full-on truck back there.

174
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:29,295
And, like, how did you do that?!
You're four feet tall and it was a truck!

175
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:32,465
Look, I know you don't need
me or Kipo to survive.

176
00:10:32,548 --> 00:10:34,467
But without us,
that's all you'll ever do.

177
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:36,302
Don't you wanna see what else there is?

178
00:10:36,594 --> 00:10:38,638
Don't you wanna see
what we could all do together?

179
00:10:38,763 --> 00:10:41,349
I'm done playing nice with others.

180
00:10:41,432 --> 00:10:42,642
Wait!

181
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:44,310
[strains]

182
00:10:46,562 --> 00:10:48,230
[grunting]

183
00:10:50,191 --> 00:10:51,776
[panting]

184
00:10:54,195 --> 00:10:56,364
[grunting]

185
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:04,538
Whoa.

186
00:11:06,707 --> 00:11:08,626
[whimpering]

187
00:11:12,296 --> 00:11:14,298
[strains]

188
00:11:14,924 --> 00:11:16,717
[giggling]

189
00:11:17,676 --> 00:11:18,594
[gasps]

190
00:11:23,766 --> 00:11:25,309
Welcome to the pack.

191
00:11:25,393 --> 00:11:27,144
[both howling]

192
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:32,191
[clanging]

193
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:39,156
So, about what you saw back there.
I-I wasn't scared, I was just...

194
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:42,618
Look, promise you'll never,
ever tell anyone about this. Ever.

195
00:11:42,701 --> 00:11:45,621
Ooh, I love making promises!

196
00:11:45,704 --> 00:11:47,790
Almost as much as I love keepin' 'em.

197
00:11:47,873 --> 00:11:52,253
You nauseate me.
Who keeps promises!?

198
00:11:52,336 --> 00:11:53,921
-Wait, you should though.
-Hmm.

199
00:11:54,004 --> 00:11:55,673
Breeze is coming in from the left.

200
00:11:55,756 --> 00:11:56,590
We should head this way.

201
00:11:56,674 --> 00:11:58,551
How do you know which way is left?

202
00:11:58,634 --> 00:12:02,096
My dad taught me!
That one's left, and that one's right.

203
00:12:02,179 --> 00:12:05,391
-This is kinda basic stuff.
-What? No, I mean how can you see?

204
00:12:05,474 --> 00:12:07,560
-Ow!
-It's pitch black in here!

205
00:12:07,643 --> 00:12:09,437
-Where is everybody?
-It is?

206
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:10,479
But you can see.

207
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:13,232
Well, that's because I'm a frog,
and frogs have impeccable night vision.

208
00:12:13,315 --> 00:12:17,820
Humans can't see in the dark.
Yet, you can. So...

209
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:22,908
[gasps] What are you?

210
00:12:23,451 --> 00:12:28,706
I don't know.
I could maybe be part mute?

211
00:12:28,789 --> 00:12:31,417
A mute?
What the bug in a rug?

212
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:35,754
You're a human and a mute?
What kind of a freak are you?

213
00:12:35,838 --> 00:12:39,175
Finally, something we can agree on.

214
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:42,761
-What, do you wanna talk about it?
-Yes!

215
00:12:42,845 --> 00:12:45,431
OK, so all my life,
I've just been an average person

216
00:12:45,514 --> 00:12:46,974
with an above-average reading level

217
00:12:47,057 --> 00:12:50,478
and then I finally turn 13
and everything just goes crazy!

218
00:12:50,561 --> 00:12:55,191
I mean, my dad told me about
"body changes," but nothing like this.

219
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:58,194
I have fur that pops out of my arm
and then goes away!

220
00:12:58,277 --> 00:13:00,529
Where does it go?!
And I can see in the dark?

221
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:03,991
And I haven't told anyone this,
but I can also smell, like, everything.

222
00:13:04,074 --> 00:13:07,870
-It's disgusting.
-You've been a mute this whole time?!

223
00:13:07,953 --> 00:13:09,205
Am I the last one to find out?!

224
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:14,251
But the worst part
is that my best friend hates me for it.

225
00:13:14,335 --> 00:13:18,964
-OK. That's the short, intense one?
-Wolf, yeah.

226
00:13:19,048 --> 00:13:22,718
I was afraid to tell her because I thought
she wouldn't wanna be my friend anymore.

227
00:13:22,801 --> 00:13:23,636
And I was right.

228
00:13:23,719 --> 00:13:25,596
She's had it out for me ever since we met.

229
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:28,933
I'm gonna go ahead and say it.
Wolf has issues!

230
00:13:29,016 --> 00:13:30,184
[yelps, grunts]

231
00:13:30,267 --> 00:13:33,103
I don't know.
Maybe she's just scared.

232
00:13:33,187 --> 00:13:34,813
I don't want her to be scared of me.

233
00:13:34,897 --> 00:13:38,192
No, not scared of you, scared of change.

234
00:13:38,275 --> 00:13:40,402
When you spend your whole life
believing one thing,

235
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:44,156
and then it's ripped away,
you can do some pretty drastic stuff.

236
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,783
Not always smart stuff.

237
00:13:47,743 --> 00:13:50,788
So, what I'm saying is,
she's weak right now.

238
00:13:50,871 --> 00:13:53,958
Perfect time to use your mute powers
to hunt her down and break her.

239
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:57,670
Or use your physical supremacy
to become queen of the humans

240
00:13:57,753 --> 00:14:00,214
and make her your servant.
You're welcome.

241
00:14:00,297 --> 00:14:03,050
I think I'll just give her some time.

242
00:14:03,133 --> 00:14:06,470
You made a really good point, Jamack.
She's probably just scared.

243
00:14:06,554 --> 00:14:08,013
I said that?

244
00:14:08,222 --> 00:14:09,515
That doesn't sound like me.

245
00:14:09,598 --> 00:14:11,850
Hey, Jamack!
How much height can you get?

246
00:14:12,476 --> 00:14:14,645
[Jamack] Oh. Get on.

247
00:14:17,982 --> 00:14:21,527
Phew. So, what happens now?

248
00:14:22,069 --> 00:14:25,447
Now, I hand you to Scarlemagne,
attain the power I so rightly deserve,

249
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:27,616
and get revenge on anyone
who's ever wronged me.

250
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:30,202
Seriously?
After all that?

251
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:31,287
I was hoping you'd say...

252
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:33,163
[imitating Jamack]
"Now we turn around, find Wolf,

253
00:14:33,247 --> 00:14:35,624
and convince her
to let you braid her hair."

254
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:37,918
-[buzzing]
-Ow! You again? Get outta here!

255
00:14:38,002 --> 00:14:41,422
You didn't seriously think
we were becoming friends?

256
00:14:41,505 --> 00:14:44,133
-Ow! Leave me alone!
-I was hoping we were.

257
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:47,928
-Because now it means I have to do this!
-[screams, grunts]

258
00:14:48,012 --> 00:14:49,847
C'mon. We've gotta find Wolf.

259
00:14:51,098 --> 00:14:53,267
Oh! Wait up!

260
00:14:59,982 --> 00:15:02,860
[screams, groans]

261
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:06,614
-Finally! I got you. You got Benson'd!
-[squeals]

262
00:15:06,697 --> 00:15:08,824
Now, if you ever wanna
experience freedom again,

263
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:10,743
you have to tell us
what's going on with you.

264
00:15:10,826 --> 00:15:12,995
-[squeals]
-[grunts]

265
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,164
Uh, it was Mandu's idea?

266
00:15:15,247 --> 00:15:16,665
[squeals]

267
00:15:17,374 --> 00:15:19,001
[sighs] Come on, Wolf.

268
00:15:19,084 --> 00:15:21,211
You taught those raccoons how to fight.

269
00:15:21,295 --> 00:15:23,964
You had plenty of chances
to kill Dave that you didn't take.

270
00:15:24,048 --> 00:15:26,300
And I saw you pet Mandu that one time.

271
00:15:26,383 --> 00:15:31,055
You don't really hate all mutes,
so, what's this actually about?

272
00:15:31,555 --> 00:15:33,057
She lied to me.

273
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:36,602
OK, but you lied to her about the map,
and she forgave you.

274
00:15:36,685 --> 00:15:39,897
She lied about who she is!
There's a difference.

275
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:43,692
-How could I ever trust her again?
-Because your friendship isn't a lie.

276
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:46,862
You're practically sisters.
You can't fake that.

277
00:15:51,033 --> 00:15:53,744
Today is our first family hunt.

278
00:15:53,827 --> 00:15:58,123
You've proven yourselves
to be swift, strong, and skilled...

279
00:15:58,207 --> 00:15:59,750
[gasps] Wow.

280
00:16:03,253 --> 00:16:06,340
But so is your prey.

281
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:07,841
[gasps]

282
00:16:07,925 --> 00:16:10,344
[growling]

283
00:16:21,188 --> 00:16:23,315
[panting]

284
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:31,031
[growling]

285
00:16:31,699 --> 00:16:34,785
But you said we were a pack.

286
00:16:38,539 --> 00:16:40,124
We're wolves.

287
00:16:40,207 --> 00:16:42,501
You're a human.

288
00:16:42,584 --> 00:16:45,713
[growling]

289
00:16:51,635 --> 00:16:55,055
You're wrong.
You can fake it.

290
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:57,891
[howling]

291
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:00,227
[gasps]

292
00:17:01,395 --> 00:17:02,604
Oh, no.

293
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:05,107
Could we just stop for a second?

294
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:07,276
So I can put my arm back on?

295
00:17:08,777 --> 00:17:11,905
[howling]

296
00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:13,615
[gasps]

297
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:16,326
Hello, Jolene.

298
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:19,121
Remember us?

299
00:17:25,127 --> 00:17:26,462
[growling]

300
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:31,175
We had you all right under our noses,
yet we couldn't sniff you out.

301
00:17:31,258 --> 00:17:34,053
We won't make that mistake again.

302
00:17:34,136 --> 00:17:36,180
So, tell us. Where is she?

303
00:17:36,263 --> 00:17:40,392
-We don't know.
-Pity. We'll find her soon enough.

304
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:43,896
In the meantime,
you'll do as a nice mid-hunt snack!

305
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:57,242
[growls]

306
00:17:58,535 --> 00:17:59,495
Kipo?

307
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:01,538
[grunts] I'm here, too.

308
00:18:01,622 --> 00:18:02,623
Just FYI.

309
00:18:02,706 --> 00:18:05,584
I'm the burrow girl.
I'm the one Scarlemagne wants.

310
00:18:05,667 --> 00:18:07,461
Take me instead.

311
00:18:07,544 --> 00:18:09,922
[laughing] Instead?

312
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:18,847
-Not so fast, moon-boy.
-[chuckles] Excuse me?

313
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:24,186
Hand over the burrow girl,
or things are gonna get real stinky.

314
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:29,817
Fools! The Mod Frogs were the first
to find the burrow girl.

315
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:32,111
-She's ours!
-Comin' in hot!

316
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:39,993
Hand over the humans, groundies,
Or we're all headin' up to the sky.

317
00:18:40,077 --> 00:18:43,914
I'll do it!
I'm crazy!

318
00:18:45,165 --> 00:18:46,875
[music plays]

319
00:18:54,508 --> 00:18:57,719
[chuckles] All right.

320
00:18:57,803 --> 00:19:00,347
OK, everyone take a seat.

321
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:03,350
Hey, you two!
Good to see you back on your feet.

322
00:19:03,433 --> 00:19:05,477
-Because remember, you fell?
-[growls]

323
00:19:05,561 --> 00:19:08,981
Wow. Everyone's here, huh?
Terrific stuff.

324
00:19:09,064 --> 00:19:11,233
Heck of a show, everyone.
Applause!

325
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:16,363
Thanks for holding onto my prisoners,
folks, but I'll take it from here, OK?

326
00:19:16,446 --> 00:19:19,449
Why don't you all head out
before things get messy.

327
00:19:20,576 --> 00:19:22,619
[all laughing]

328
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:29,209
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
Keep it going, everyone.

329
00:19:29,293 --> 00:19:31,253
You're gonna love it.
It's gonna be great.

330
00:19:31,336 --> 00:19:32,588
Ah, you idiots.

331
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:34,506
[sniffing]

332
00:19:37,718 --> 00:19:39,178
Mega Bunny fur.

333
00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:40,804
[gasps]

334
00:19:41,805 --> 00:19:44,016
[screaming]

335
00:19:46,977 --> 00:19:48,312
[growls]

336
00:19:59,656 --> 00:20:01,617
[laughing]

337
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:02,951
[grunts]

338
00:20:23,138 --> 00:20:24,806
[Kipo] So, I guess this is it.

339
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:27,017
You're gonna get
everything you wanted, huh?

340
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:29,102
There's something
you don't understand, Kipo.

341
00:20:29,186 --> 00:20:32,773
Up here,
you have to be selfish to survive.

342
00:20:32,856 --> 00:20:35,484
You don't seem to know how to do that.

343
00:20:35,567 --> 00:20:37,778
You insist on helping and talking.

344
00:20:38,278 --> 00:20:41,073
One day, it'll be your end.

345
00:20:46,119 --> 00:20:49,957
Now, take your friends... and go.

346
00:20:50,624 --> 00:20:51,833
What?

347
00:20:52,417 --> 00:20:53,794
Before I change my mind.

348
00:20:53,877 --> 00:20:56,338
Whoa, she changed your heart, dude!

349
00:20:57,089 --> 00:20:59,925
He's changing his mind!
Bail! Bail!

350
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:03,220
[buzzes]

351
00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:05,055
[grunts]

352
00:21:09,226 --> 00:21:10,602
I'm sorry I ran.

353
00:21:11,436 --> 00:21:13,605
I was scared of what was happening to you.

354
00:21:13,689 --> 00:21:16,149
Scared that you'd hurt me.

355
00:21:16,233 --> 00:21:19,236
I still am, but I'm tired of running.

356
00:21:19,319 --> 00:21:21,029
I'm scared, too.

357
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:25,993
But whatever happens on the outside,
who I am on the inside isn't gonna change.

358
00:21:26,076 --> 00:21:28,787
We're sisters.
No matter what.

359
00:21:29,371 --> 00:21:32,666
[gasps]
You're hugging me?

360
00:21:32,749 --> 00:21:34,126
Deal with it.

361
00:21:36,837 --> 00:21:38,130
[Benson] We're here!

362
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:43,135
[Kipo] I can't believe we're almost
to the Second Clover.

363
00:21:43,218 --> 00:21:44,469
And my dad!

364
00:21:46,513 --> 00:21:50,225
[Wolf] If we can make it through
without the Mega Dogs chewing us to bits.

365
00:21:51,852 --> 00:21:53,520
[Mega Dogs barking]

366
00:21:55,814 --> 00:21:57,524
I have an idea.

367
00:21:59,693 --> 00:22:02,362
[piano playing]

368
00:22:02,446 --> 00:22:04,031
[buzzes]

369
00:22:05,657 --> 00:22:06,992
Ooh.

370
00:22:09,953 --> 00:22:12,289
[panting]

371
00:22:18,045 --> 00:22:19,129
[grunts]

372
00:22:24,426 --> 00:22:28,513
He let her go?

373
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:33,935
Wait, he let her go.
It's genius!

374
00:22:34,227 --> 00:22:36,688
[laughing]

375
00:22:36,855 --> 00:22:40,025
Someone ready my flamingos.
