[crowd murmuring]

00:00:26,109 --> 00:00:27,902
Scarlemagne better hurry.

7
00:00:27,986 --> 00:00:30,655
Just 'cause we're here
doesn't mean we have to play nice.

My Mute brothers and sisters!

You all came, like I asked.

12
00:00:43,376 --> 00:00:45,045
That was smart of you.

There's a burrow girl on the loose!

17
00:00:55,472 --> 00:00:57,849
Pardon me, lost my composure there
for a moment.

[sighs]

19
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:05,482
It was only 200 years ago that humans,
like that burrow girl...

[all growling]

21
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:10,695
...kept us locked up in prisons
just like this one!

22
00:01:10,779 --> 00:01:14,074
Well, now the tables have turned.

[birds squawking]

00:01:18,411 --> 00:01:21,581
This is how all humans
should be, obedient.

25
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:23,583
I can make them into an army.

26
00:01:23,666 --> 00:01:26,419
An army I can use to build an empire!

27
00:01:26,503 --> 00:01:29,297

Back to that burrow girl.

31
00:01:41,684 --> 00:01:47,232
She can lead me to more humans.
Enough to rule Las Vistas.

32
00:01:47,315 --> 00:01:51,486
Whoever brings her to me will be rewarded
with a position of power and luxury,

33
00:01:51,569 --> 00:01:54,239
beyond your wildest dreams.

34
00:01:54,322 --> 00:01:58,326

00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:06,209
That's better.

39
00:02:07,085 --> 00:02:09,671
Bring me the burrow girl!

40
00:02:10,713 --> 00:02:14,425

Nothing would give me more pleasure.

Hmm, according to this map, my dad
wants us to head toward a giant nose.

44
00:02:43,204 --> 00:02:45,165
Maybe I'm reading this wrong.

Oh, oh!

-And remember in our water vision when--
-That musical floor?

48
00:02:53,047 --> 00:02:55,466
Yeah!
And people were cheering our names.

49
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:59,053
They were like "Benson! Benson!"
-"Dave! Dave! Dave!

[both continue chanting]

51
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:04,100
I think that was the happiest
I've ever been in my whole life.

52
00:03:04,183 --> 00:03:06,477
-[gasps] Uh, Dave?
-Yeah?

53
00:03:06,561 --> 00:03:08,229
What if I'm never that happy again?

That's unusual.

60
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:28,458
So, uh, Wolf?

61
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:31,127
Things got pretty emotional last night.

62
00:03:31,419 --> 00:03:32,837
-Can we talk about it?
-Nope!

63
00:03:33,922 --> 00:03:38,885
OK, well, at the campfire, when you said,
"We go our separate ways",

64
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:41,930
why is that happening exactly?

65
00:03:42,013 --> 00:03:44,057
Our deal was,
I get you back to your people,

66
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:45,683
and then I move on.

67
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:50,063
After all we've been through,
you still feel that way?

68
00:03:50,146 --> 00:03:52,565
-I don't do burrows.
-Why not?

69
00:03:52,649 --> 00:03:54,484
They're... they're safe, warm,

70
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:57,320
and you have
this great community of people.

71
00:03:57,403 --> 00:03:59,572
-I hate most people.
-Oh, c'mon.

72
00:03:59,656 --> 00:04:01,366
You haven't even met that many people.

73
00:04:01,449 --> 00:04:04,911
There's school, Taco Tuesdays,
game nights...

74
00:04:04,994 --> 00:04:06,996
That's not fun, that's torture.

75
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:12,001
-No.
-No?

76
00:04:12,585 --> 00:04:15,380
No.
I do not accept this.

77
00:04:15,463 --> 00:04:17,840
I will change your mind,
Wolfatha Christie the Fourth.

-You wait and see.
-Wolfatha Christie the Fourth?

See?
Even Mandu thinks I can do it.

82
00:04:27,308 --> 00:04:28,977
I will convince you to come with me.

83
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:30,979
[Dave] Whoa! Big nose!

84
00:04:31,896 --> 00:04:33,439
[gasps] It is a nose!

00:04:33,523 --> 00:04:37,318
[Benson] Oh... [groans] Gross!
What is that smell?!

86
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:39,904
[gasps] That lunch box!

87

It's got the same symbol as the map!

88
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:44,033
Oh, I got this.

This canyon's got a bottom, right?

and not pointy rocks!

Wait, is that it?

Uh, sorry to interrupt.

I think they're friendly.

Mutes aren't friendly.

00:07:20,606 --> 00:07:24,152
[gasps] Some of us are!
Though I don't blame ya for being jumpy.

131
00:07:24,235 --> 00:07:28,531
We've heard what it's like on the surface.
So much fighting all the time.

Totally terrifying!

or leotards or cool big hair!

-Uh, sorry to disappoint?
-No disappointment here.

146
00:08:10,781 --> 00:08:13,826
Expectations are just placeholders
for reality.

147
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:17,788
-So, what brings you here?!
-We're looking for a lunchbox.

148
00:08:17,872 --> 00:08:20,249
We were looking for it
when we fell into your home.

149
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:22,502
It could be anywhere, really.

150
00:08:22,585 --> 00:08:27,798
Sounds like you're in a jam.
But we can help you out! [laughs]

151
00:08:27,882 --> 00:08:31,135
Why don't we show you where everything is,
so we can get extra steps,

152
00:08:31,219 --> 00:08:32,845
and then we can all help look!

153
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:35,806
-No. We can do it ourselv--
-That would be amazing!

[laughs] One tour, please.

155

Whoo! Here's the cardio corner!
My favorite.

156
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,445
Huh? Huh?

[growls]

158
00:08:52,698 --> 00:08:56,410
And that stuff is for cheat day!

159
00:08:59,622 --> 00:09:01,457
[gasps] Benson, check it out!

160
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:05,962
Expired candy, chocolate,
explosion berry cola!

161
00:09:07,004 --> 00:09:09,006
Wow. That's... that's great.

162
00:09:10,466 --> 00:09:11,467
Oh, yeah.

163
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:14,512
Hey, buddy, you seem a little down.

164
00:09:14,595 --> 00:09:18,307
I do? Oh, man,
I don't know what's happening to me.

165
00:09:21,477 --> 00:09:25,606
Every day we wake up, eat breakfast,
work out, help each other with chores,

166
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:29,360
work out, drink a post-workout shake,
and then a pre-workout shake

167
00:09:29,443 --> 00:09:32,655
for the end-of-the-day dance workout
to get our steps in.

168
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:34,156
Great. Good for you.

169
00:09:34,532 --> 00:09:36,742
We should really find that lunchbox
and get out of here.

170
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:39,203
OK, well, what does it look like?

171
00:09:39,287 --> 00:09:41,497
It's red and it's got
the symbol for Aries.

172
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:42,582
He's a ram.

173
00:09:46,002 --> 00:09:47,712
Thanks, guys!

174
00:09:48,713 --> 00:09:50,715
What an amazingly helpful community!

175
00:09:50,965 --> 00:09:52,883
-I know what you're trying to do.
-What?

176
00:09:52,967 --> 00:09:56,304
If these super nice raccoons want to help,
it's not their fault that they're awesome,

177
00:09:56,387 --> 00:10:00,224
and show you how communities,
like burrows, are also awesome.

178
00:10:00,891 --> 00:10:04,145
No one's this nice.
I don't buy their whole innocent act.

179
00:10:04,228 --> 00:10:06,314
It's only a matter of time
before they turn us in to Scarlemagne.

180
00:10:06,397 --> 00:10:09,650
[scoffs] No way!
They have it too good down here.

181
00:10:09,734 --> 00:10:11,444
C'mon, let me show you!

Oh, that is just sad.

00:10:23,748 --> 00:10:26,959
-Hey, where's the DJ?
-I'm looking at him!

186
00:10:27,543 --> 00:10:29,420
C'mon, man, you know what to do.

00:10:33,716 --> 00:10:35,509
All right, squeeze those buns!
Work them glutes!

Let's go! Let's go!

Squeeze those buns!

Ah! Boom!
There you go.

-Yeah, this is pretty great.
-"Great?" Try epic!

198
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:10,628
This is just like it was
at Mulholland's sick house, only real!

199
00:11:10,711 --> 00:11:14,590
It is. And I should be just as happy,
like smiling and everything,

200
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:16,801
but I don't know why this isn't working.

Whoo! [laughs]
Isn't this fun?

202
00:11:24,809 --> 00:11:25,893
Not really.

203

[chuckles]
Come on! You're not even trying.

204
00:11:31,065 --> 00:11:33,484
-We should be looking for that lunchbox.
-Why?

205
00:11:33,567 --> 00:11:36,946
So we can find my burrow
and you can leave that much faster?

206
00:11:39,407 --> 00:11:42,034
Wolf, you're my best friend.

207
00:11:42,118 --> 00:11:43,452
Is it that easy to say goodbye to me?

208
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:45,663
No, I...

209
00:11:46,455 --> 00:11:47,748
Then don't!

Stop!

00:12:03,347 --> 00:12:05,433
How are you still exercising?

218
00:12:05,516 --> 00:12:08,227
Because we've barely broken a sweat!

219
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:10,563
Oh, you mean the pigeon.
That was just Beak Beak.

220
00:12:10,646 --> 00:12:11,647
It comes here all the time.

221
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:13,524
Every now and then
it takes an energy snack.

222
00:12:13,607 --> 00:12:17,027
It's kind of big, if you didn't notice.
Not much we can do about it!

223
00:12:17,111 --> 00:12:20,948
There's a lot you can do about it.
You can get rid of Beak Beak!

224
00:12:21,031 --> 00:12:25,369
Some of us tried, a long time ago.
And they're gone now.

225
00:12:25,453 --> 00:12:31,709
[crying] Oh...
Oh, this feels good, but also sad.

226
00:12:31,792 --> 00:12:35,921
We're no match for Beak Beak,
and that's OK.

227
00:12:36,005 --> 00:12:37,840
Once you accept the world as it is,

228
00:12:37,923 --> 00:12:42,178
and stop hoping for what it could be,
you find peace.

229
00:12:42,678 --> 00:12:44,221
We'll miss you, Hot Dog Bun!

230
00:12:44,305 --> 00:12:48,517
And Rusted Can! And Fish Bone!
And Dirty Diaper and DJ Crowbar!

231
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:51,604
That's what happened to the DJ?!

232
00:12:55,649 --> 00:12:59,236
Wolf, I know you're gonna object,
but we have to help these raccoons!

233
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,613
Yeah, I agree.

234
00:13:00,696 --> 00:13:02,656
[gasps]
Really?!

235
00:13:03,407 --> 00:13:06,327
Does that mean you've changed your mind
about being part of a community that--

236
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:07,286
No.

237
00:13:07,369 --> 00:13:08,829
It means we can't find that lunchbox

238
00:13:08,913 --> 00:13:11,457
if a giant bird could eat us
at any moment.

239
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:12,458
Oh.

240
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:14,585
But we're on the same page
about Beak Beak.

241
00:13:14,668 --> 00:13:18,756
And if this is one of the last things
we do together, let's make it fun!

242
00:13:20,174 --> 00:13:21,884
Everybody, listen up.

243
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:24,929
A place doesn't make you safe.
You make you safe.

244
00:13:25,095 --> 00:13:27,431
You're only helpless and weak
if you let yourself be.

245
00:13:27,515 --> 00:13:32,561
Yes, Beak Beak is huge, scary, horrifying,
but we're smarter.

246
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:35,314
We can take him.
Who's with me?

247
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:37,608
She's right!

248
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:40,069
I'm with her!

249
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:41,695
Let's do this!

250
00:13:44,573 --> 00:13:46,116
Guess it's just us.

251
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:51,455
If you won't help us,
at least tell us where to find Beak Beak.

252
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:55,417
Legend has it,
you must walk past Yoga Yurt Village

253
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:57,711
and through the tunnel of sweat.

254
00:13:57,795 --> 00:14:02,925
-There, you will find him.
-In the Pit of Despair!

255
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:05,177
[grunting]

256
00:14:07,846 --> 00:14:09,014
[Benson]
There's Beak Beak.

257
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:15,354
Uh, it's not so much a "pit of despair"
as it is a fat bird on a wire.

258
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:17,731
[squawks]

259
00:14:25,489 --> 00:14:26,740
Ooh, do you have a plan?

260
00:14:26,824 --> 00:14:29,326
That's your...
[deep voice] "I have a plan" face.

261
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:32,997
I have a plan.
But we're going to need those raccoons.

262
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:36,417
Because if we can't convince them,
we can trick them?

263
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:39,295
[grunting]

264
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:41,964
Hey! Glad you're here.

265
00:14:42,047 --> 00:14:44,842
Can you help me
with this workout I want to try?

266
00:14:44,925 --> 00:14:46,093
Workout, huh?

267
00:14:46,176 --> 00:14:48,929
Yeah!
Of course, I'm in!

You're like a majestic redwood, TD,

269
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:57,730
but how Zen would it be to do
tree pose on top of a tree?

running with... mirrors?

-Nope.

-Yup. It's Beak Beak.

-But we told you we can't do this!
-Yes, you can! We believe in you!

-Plus, it's too late to back out!
-Now, run like your lives depend on it!

00:16:02,211 --> 00:16:03,796
Because they do!

283
00:16:21,021 --> 00:16:23,065
This isn't really a tree...

284
00:16:23,148 --> 00:16:27,111
No, but it has the energy of a tree.

285
00:16:27,194 --> 00:16:29,113
Don't you feel it?
I know I do.

I don't know! Let's see if you can
pull those bands around this stake.

Oh, target my delts.

00:19:58,363 --> 00:19:59,698
I just got it.

351
00:19:59,781 --> 00:20:00,782
Huh.

352
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:03,493
I guess it means something
when you earn the cheers.

353
00:20:03,577 --> 00:20:06,872
You have to earn the cheers!
Yes, you do. Oh, you're so cute.

354
00:20:12,586 --> 00:20:14,588
What are you waiting for?
Open it.

355
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:17,841
Huh?

356
00:20:18,675 --> 00:20:20,219
What are these for?

357
00:20:20,302 --> 00:20:22,346
Maybe we're not looking
in the right place.

358
00:20:26,975 --> 00:20:28,685
[strains]

359
00:20:32,397 --> 00:20:35,651
Aw, look!
Those are dogs!

360
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:38,987
Such little cuties.
[gasps] I've always wanted to pet one.

361
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:41,198
Little? They're 50 feet tall.

362
00:20:42,658 --> 00:20:43,617
[gasps]

363
00:20:47,329 --> 00:20:49,623
The Second Clover.
[laughs]

364
00:20:49,706 --> 00:20:51,792
Guys, that's it!
We found it!

365
00:20:54,544 --> 00:20:58,340
If your dad expects us to get in there,
he's as crazy as you are.

366
00:20:58,423 --> 00:21:01,260
[wind blowing]

367
00:21:04,471 --> 00:21:08,600
Once we get there, is that really
going to be it for us, Wolf?

368
00:21:17,985 --> 00:21:19,111
[Wolf] No.

369
00:21:19,611 --> 00:21:20,612
[Kipo] What?

370
00:21:20,862 --> 00:21:22,489
Burrows are stupid.

371
00:21:22,572 --> 00:21:26,118
But I guess if I'm with you,
it could be fun.

372
00:21:26,201 --> 00:21:27,536
Wolfatha Christie the Fourth,

373
00:21:27,619 --> 00:21:29,454
that's the sweetest thing
you've ever said!

374
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:31,331
-Wolf's going to the burrow!
-[Kipo laughs]

375
00:21:31,415 --> 00:21:33,959
No promises
If I hate it, I'm leaving.

376
00:21:34,042 --> 00:21:35,669
-[Benson] Wa-hoo!
-[Kipo laughs]

377
00:21:35,752 --> 00:21:36,795
[Mandu squeals]

378
00:21:42,175 --> 00:21:43,302
[gasps]

379
00:21:45,012 --> 00:21:48,598
Um, I've been trying
to tell you about this.

380
00:21:48,682 --> 00:21:50,600
Well, at first I didn't even know
what was happening.

381
00:21:50,684 --> 00:21:52,561
It was like fur-poof!
Wha...?

382
00:21:52,644 --> 00:21:58,650
But after my vision from Mulholland,
I'm pretty sure I'm part mute.

383
00:21:58,734 --> 00:22:00,652
You're a mute?

384
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,154
I'm still me.

385
00:22:02,237 --> 00:22:03,822
-[gasps]
-What is it?

386
00:22:04,448 --> 00:22:06,033
Wolf, talk to me.

387
00:22:06,116 --> 00:22:06,950
[gasps]

388
00:22:10,495 --> 00:22:13,415
I... I... No!

389
00:22:13,498 --> 00:22:14,583
[panting]

390
00:22:16,084 --> 00:22:18,211
-Benson?
-Hey, it's gonna be OK.

391
00:22:18,295 --> 00:22:21,882
She just needs a little time to process.
I'll get her back.

392
00:22:22,174 --> 00:22:23,383
Here.

393
00:22:25,385 --> 00:22:28,680
Wolf! Wolf! Stop!

394
00:22:32,976 --> 00:22:35,896
Great, now it goes away.

395
00:22:37,898 --> 00:22:38,774
[grunts]

396
00:22:39,149 --> 00:22:41,276
[Jamack laughs]
Burrow girl.
