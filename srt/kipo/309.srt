00:00:25,567 --> 00:00:27,819
-Hey, Dad.
-How was school today?

7
00:00:27,902 --> 00:00:29,529
Good.
I was the only one who figured out

8
00:00:29,612 --> 00:00:31,990
how to clone a cell
from an old mandrill fossil.

9
00:00:32,073 --> 00:00:35,952
"Good" would be if you fixed
the Great Mutant Outbreak, Emilia.

10
00:00:36,494 --> 00:00:37,829
But it's a start.

11
00:00:37,912 --> 00:00:39,164
What about you, Liam?

12
00:00:39,247 --> 00:00:40,999
I scored the winning goal in Burrow Ball.

13
00:00:41,082 --> 00:00:43,168
Coach said<i> I </i>could be coach one day!

14
00:00:43,251 --> 00:00:45,754
Your future is not in a burrow!

15
00:00:46,337 --> 00:00:48,506
It's up there on the surface.

16
00:00:48,923 --> 00:00:51,009
Am I understood?

17
00:00:51,843 --> 00:00:52,719
Yes, sir.

[chair sliding]

19
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:01,561
You don't have to be so hard on him.

20
00:01:01,644 --> 00:01:02,854
Yes, I do.

21
00:01:02,937 --> 00:01:06,441
He's getting distracted.
Our mission is bigger than a stupid game.

22
00:01:06,524 --> 00:01:07,859
It's bigger than us!

23
00:01:08,443 --> 00:01:11,780
-We cannot lose our fire.
-We won't.

24
00:01:11,863 --> 00:01:15,241
We<i> will </i>be the ones
to return humans to our rightful place.

25
00:01:15,325 --> 00:01:19,621
Every generation thinks they're gonna be
the ones to bring humans back on top.

26
00:01:19,704 --> 00:01:22,290
And eventually,
every generation gives up.

27
00:01:22,373 --> 00:01:24,000
I don't give up.

28
00:01:24,084 --> 00:01:26,252
Make sure your brother doesn't either.

29
00:01:27,253 --> 00:01:28,421
Keep him focused.

30
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:29,964
Yes, sir.

31
00:01:30,507 --> 00:01:31,674

-Don't try and stop me!
-I'm not.

36
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:22,475
I thought we understood each other.

37
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:24,227
Emilia needs to go.

38
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:25,478
Yeah, I know.

39
00:02:25,562 --> 00:02:27,272
All right, fisticuffs it is.

40
00:02:28,523 --> 00:02:30,608
Oh! [coughs]

41
00:02:30,859 --> 00:02:33,153
Air freshener,
so Kipo won't be able to track you.

42
00:02:33,236 --> 00:02:35,989
Because, as I've been<i> saying,</i>
I'm here to help.

43
00:02:36,447 --> 00:02:37,323
Oh!

44
00:02:37,407 --> 00:02:41,161
Well, I wish I didn't smell
like lavender breeze, but good.

45
00:02:41,244 --> 00:02:44,998
You do realize we're not just
going to have a conversation with Emilia.

46
00:02:45,081 --> 00:02:46,749
Yeah. Let's go.

47
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:49,711
[laughs]

48
00:02:51,963 --> 00:02:55,174
You all realize this will
be like the Walrus from yesterday,

49
00:02:55,341 --> 00:02:57,176
but with no Emilia to save you.

50
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:59,888
Well, if that's the way you feel,
why are you coming to Prahm?

51
00:02:59,971 --> 00:03:03,474
To make Doag come to her senses
and return to the ship with me.

52
00:03:03,892 --> 00:03:06,102
-Your loss.
-That's fine, but we're goin'.

[woman] I want a cat best friend.

54
00:03:07,353 --> 00:03:09,105
Huh, it's your funeral.

55
00:03:15,445 --> 00:03:17,405
Looks like Emilia isn't with them.

56
00:03:17,488 --> 00:03:20,158
Then she'll be on the boat,
with minimal defenses, alone,

57
00:03:20,241 --> 00:03:23,953
unaware that we are the nightmares
that haunt her shadow...

58
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:25,246
Oh, you've left.

Ha! Ha!

No sign of Scarlemagne<i> or </i>Wolf.

63
00:03:52,148 --> 00:03:54,359
Oh, my gosh, guys,
this place looks amazing!

64
00:03:54,442 --> 00:03:56,694
Of course, they would know exactly
how to hide from me.

65
00:03:57,195 --> 00:03:59,030
Ooh. Twinkle lights.

66
00:03:59,113 --> 00:03:59,989
I can't believe them!

67
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:02,242
You did find a killer
Prahm dress, though.

68
00:04:02,325 --> 00:04:04,202
Oh, you like it? It was on sale.

69
00:04:04,285 --> 00:04:05,912
Like, a hundred years ago, but still.

70
00:04:05,995 --> 00:04:08,498
I was super excited
to show it to Wolf, but...

71
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:09,707
She's not here.

72
00:04:09,832 --> 00:04:11,459
[groans] Don't remind me!

73
00:04:11,542 --> 00:04:12,835
How could they do this?

74
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:15,296
They're just trying to protect you,
in their own way.

75
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:19,509
But if we don't give Emilia a chance,
Prahm is basically a lie.

76
00:04:19,592 --> 00:04:24,180
Kipo, I know you want to believe
that Emilia will do the right thing,

77
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:26,307
but there's something you should know.

78
00:04:26,391 --> 00:04:28,643
-She won't.
-You don't know that for sure.

79
00:04:28,726 --> 00:04:29,727
I do.

80
00:04:29,811 --> 00:04:33,231
When I was the Mega Monkey,
Emilia told me things.

81
00:04:33,314 --> 00:04:36,359
Things she didn't think
I'd ever be able to tell anyone.

82
00:04:36,442 --> 00:04:41,322
Trust me, you have no idea
what she is willing to do for her beliefs.

83
00:04:42,865 --> 00:04:47,370
<i>Our entire burrow was dedicated</i>
<i>to ending the Great Mutant Outbreak,</i>

84
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:49,289
<i>but Emilia stood apart.</i>

85
00:04:49,372 --> 00:04:51,207
<i>Her fervor was unmatched.</i>

86
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:52,667

00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:11,352
Well, I'm proud of you.
This is a big deal.

91
00:05:11,436 --> 00:05:13,271
You got a clipboard and everything!

92
00:05:13,771 --> 00:05:14,647
Shut up.

93
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:16,816
Do you think they're gonna
give me a smaller clipboard?

94
00:05:16,899 --> 00:05:20,403
Yeah, I'm having a really tiny one
made for you right now.

95
00:05:20,486 --> 00:05:22,113
And I'm getting a bigger one for me.

96
00:05:22,196 --> 00:05:24,866
[laughs]
So, what now, boss?

97
00:05:24,949 --> 00:05:29,370
You know, if we're gonna cure them,
we need a sample from one of the mutes.

98
00:05:29,787 --> 00:05:31,164
Ready to see the sun?

99
00:05:31,247 --> 00:05:32,623

Don't let your guard down.

You, either.

105
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:46,012

121
00:06:33,434 --> 00:06:36,479
No problem.
Who knew humans were so cool?

122
00:06:36,562 --> 00:06:40,024
And who knew cheese was a thing?
Hit me with some more!

[background music continues to play]

124
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,617
[Emilia] You made mute<i> friends?</i>

125
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:52,036
Well, at first I was just
trying to get the sample.

126
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:55,289
But then they were just so nice,
and they gave me cheese and--

127
00:06:55,373 --> 00:06:56,833
And you made friends with them!

128
00:06:56,916 --> 00:07:00,336
Yes, but they're not the monsters
we thought they were.

129
00:07:00,419 --> 00:07:02,380
They even have an amusement park!

130
00:07:02,463 --> 00:07:04,006
Oh, a-and after meeting me,

131
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:07,802
they're gonna make it a safe zone
for mutes<i> and </i>humans.

132
00:07:07,885 --> 00:07:10,930
-How cool is that?
-Liam, you can't be serious.

133
00:07:11,013 --> 00:07:14,308
-We are going to be the ones who--
-Bring humans back to the surface!

134
00:07:14,392 --> 00:07:17,728
We can do that!
Just without getting rid of all the mutes.

135
00:07:17,812 --> 00:07:19,021
What? No!

136
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:20,982
They took our world from us, Liam.

137
00:07:21,065 --> 00:07:23,443
Everything they have, they took from<i> us.</i>

138
00:07:23,526 --> 00:07:25,820
If we let them exist, they'll do it again!

139
00:07:25,903 --> 00:07:27,822
What if it's not
as black and white as that?

140
00:07:27,905 --> 00:07:31,075
What if everything
we've been taught is wrong?

141
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:33,953
I'm gonna show people
what mutes are really like.

142
00:07:34,036 --> 00:07:36,038
This will change everything!

143
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:40,209
[Snow]<i> Emilia knew that if Liam</i>
<i>made it back to the burrow,</i>

But... he did not die in vain.

152
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:06,277
It is up to us.

153
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:09,906
We must honor my brother's sacrifice

154
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:11,991
and create the cure

155
00:08:12,074 --> 00:08:15,828
that will free us
from this underground prison!

156
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:18,664
Poor Liam.

157
00:08:18,748 --> 00:08:21,209
All this time, I believed her.

158
00:08:21,292 --> 00:08:25,671
For the first time in my 200 years
of life, I lost my appetite.

159
00:08:28,674 --> 00:08:31,344
OK, it's... it's back,
it was gone, though, it was.

160
00:08:31,427 --> 00:08:35,765
If Emilia was willing to sacrifice
her own brother for what she believes,

161
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:38,267
there is no line she won't cross.

162
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:40,228
You know what,
I'm just gonna say it:

163
00:08:40,311 --> 00:08:42,605
I hope Scarlemagne and Wolf do find her.

164
00:08:42,688 --> 00:08:46,317
No. Emilia has done
unthinkably evil things,

165
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:49,862
but if I don't believe
people are capable of change,

166
00:08:49,946 --> 00:08:51,614
then what's this party even for?

167
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:53,533
-It's starting.
-Exactly!

168
00:08:53,616 --> 00:08:55,284
Change starts now.

169
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:57,119
-And we--
-No, no, no, I mean the party.

170
00:08:57,203 --> 00:08:58,412
It's starting.

I'm sure they'll be here soon.

one of them stays far, far away.

Oh, no. You don't mean Zane?

-Really?
-Of course.

194
00:09:50,715 --> 00:09:54,844
Visiting Ratland helped me see
that coexisting together is possible.

It... it helped a lot of people.

196

"mutes can be our friends" thing is bogus.

Mutes attack, eat, or mind control us.

I really made a mess of things, didn't I?

355
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:45,397
I was so wrapped up in creating an empire,
when I should have gone after Emilia.

356
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:50,319
I could have freed Song, forgiven Lio,
grown up with Kipo.

Things would have been so different

358

for the mistakes of a few.

-Kipo.
-Yes, I know.

00:18:03,665 --> 00:18:06,168
That girl would find a reason
to befriend a broom.

If she didn't, I'd be alone,

Great. I'm not.

What is it gonna take?

Oh, oh, let me guess.

386
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:27,624
It starts with "Wolf"
and ends with "being here."

387
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:31,044
Yeah. It's just,
whenever I imagined this,

I always thought she'd be with me.

390
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:40,053
Our song would play and I'd say,
"Ah! Let's dance!"

391
00:19:40,137 --> 00:19:42,264
And she'd go, "Kipo, no."

A chocolate covered sweater, huh?
Would you like that?
