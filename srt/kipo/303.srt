[squeals]

3
00:00:26,109 --> 00:00:28,111
Do we need any of these?

4
00:00:28,194 --> 00:00:32,282
I don't know, Greta,
do we need noodles to rebuild my lab?

5
00:00:32,782 --> 00:00:37,620
Um... by your tone,
I feel like we might not.

6
00:00:37,704 --> 00:00:40,498
Put the noodles down.
We have a list for a reason.

7
00:00:40,582 --> 00:00:43,585
The next time Kipo comes we'll be ready.

8
00:00:43,668 --> 00:00:45,545
We'll be ready for them all.

00:00:45,628 --> 00:00:46,671

[grunting]

13
00:01:06,649 --> 00:01:07,525
Let go!

[gasps]

16
00:01:36,888 --> 00:01:38,973
So, you see, if you guys join HMUFA,

17
00:01:39,432 --> 00:01:42,769
everyone from the burrow
will see how not-scary mutes are.

18
00:01:42,852 --> 00:01:45,188
-No offence, Yumyan.
-None taken.

19
00:01:45,271 --> 00:01:47,941
Then the humans will be, like,
"Emilia's the one who's evil!"

20
00:01:48,024 --> 00:01:51,152
And then friendship wins forever and ever!

21
00:01:52,737 --> 00:01:54,989
-Guys!
-Hm? Oh, sorry.

22
00:01:55,073 --> 00:01:58,118
-Do it again.
-Friendship wins forever and ever!

23
00:01:58,201 --> 00:01:59,244
[all] Friendship!

00:01:59,327 --> 00:02:00,829
[groans]

25
00:02:01,621 --> 00:02:04,165
First of all, we love your energy.

26
00:02:04,249 --> 00:02:08,253
Your positivity is an ocean,
and we're getting rocked by your waves.

27
00:02:08,336 --> 00:02:11,047
But... we definitely can't
join your alliance.

28
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:14,008
-What? Why not?
-Because we're afraid!

29
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:16,469
Of the humans?
They're just confused.

30
00:02:16,553 --> 00:02:18,221
No, not them.

31
00:02:18,304 --> 00:02:20,014
[whispering] We're afraid of him!

32
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:23,101
[crowd chattering]

33
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:27,147
Scarlemagne tried to send us
into the final meditation.

34
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:29,482
He destroyed our beautiful park!

35
00:02:29,566 --> 00:02:31,276
RIP Ratland.

36
00:02:31,359 --> 00:02:37,365
Look, I'm sorry, Kipo,
but if he's here, we are out of here.

37
00:02:37,866 --> 00:02:40,994
But he's in a cage,
and he can't conquer anyone from in there.

38
00:02:41,077 --> 00:02:43,913
Besides, he's really sorry... probably.

39
00:02:45,456 --> 00:02:48,293
[all laughing]

40
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:54,799
Dave!

41
00:02:54,883 --> 00:02:56,843
Oh... I thought you were joking.

42
00:02:56,926 --> 00:02:59,888
Scarlemagne sorry?
Fat chance.

43
00:02:59,971 --> 00:03:03,850
I gotta do crunches just thinking about
all the fat in that chance.

44
00:03:03,933 --> 00:03:05,560
[grunting]

45
00:03:05,643 --> 00:03:08,438
Stop crunching!
I'm serious.

46
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:10,481
I know, deep down, he's sorry.

47
00:03:10,565 --> 00:03:12,609
What if I can get him to apologize?

48
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:14,527
[all laughing]

49
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:22,994
Oh... you're serious.

50
00:03:24,454 --> 00:03:26,831
[Kipo] So, you see,
you just need to give them a real,

51
00:03:26,915 --> 00:03:29,542
honest apology
at the HMUFA meeting later today.

52
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:32,587
[laughing]

53
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:36,966
Oh, oh, that's good.
Oh... Oh, you're serious?

54
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:38,217
Well, very well.

55
00:03:38,301 --> 00:03:42,222
-What do I get if I apologize?
-Nothing.

56
00:03:42,305 --> 00:03:44,933
You do it because it's the right thing
to do, and you're a nice person.

57
00:03:45,016 --> 00:03:47,852
Somewhere deep.
Very... deep inside.

58
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:51,689
-Deep.
-Only one problem with that plan, Kipo.

59
00:03:51,773 --> 00:03:54,275
To apologize,
he'd actually have to mean it.

60
00:03:54,359 --> 00:03:59,280
Oh, I'm so deeply, terribly sorry.
What have I done?

61
00:03:59,364 --> 00:04:01,991
Leave me to my shame!

62
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:04,994
No, I don't.
See? It's easy.

63
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:13,878
Crab again?
We're in a forest.

64
00:04:13,962 --> 00:04:16,464
There's fruits and vegetables everywhere!

65
00:04:16,547 --> 00:04:19,300
All I'm asking is for you to
completely change your heart

66
00:04:19,384 --> 00:04:21,302
and tell them that you're honestly sorry
for everything you've done.

67
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:25,598
I don't know.
Sounds like a whole thing.

68
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:29,978
People tend not to forgive someone
who's tried to pour molten gold on them.

69
00:04:30,812 --> 00:04:32,188
[sighs]

70
00:04:39,028 --> 00:04:40,530
Am I crazy to try?

71
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:42,282
-No!
-Yes.

72
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:43,825
Scarlemagne's wrong.

73
00:04:43,908 --> 00:04:46,160
And if there's anyone
who can prove it, it's you.

74
00:04:47,328 --> 00:04:49,497
[sniffing]
I'm not eating this.

75
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:52,000
The smell of the sea revolts me!

76
00:04:53,501 --> 00:04:55,712
[sighs]

00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:01,092

[yelling]

80
00:05:14,397 --> 00:05:16,232
I hear you go by "Wolf" now.

81
00:05:16,941 --> 00:05:17,775
Margot!

82
00:05:18,443 --> 00:05:20,445
I wanted to...
[yelling]

83
00:05:22,905 --> 00:05:24,407
[grunting]

84
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:25,533
Wait!

85
00:05:25,616 --> 00:05:27,368
-[grunts]
-Just give me a second!

86
00:05:27,452 --> 00:05:28,911

[grunting]

89
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:34,125
What's going on?

90
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,753
Why are you chasing a wolf girl
in a school unifo...

91
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:39,213
Oh, my, Margot!
Is that the girl who betrayed you?

92
00:05:39,297 --> 00:05:42,175
-She's mine!
-OK, I respect your boundaries.

93
00:05:42,258 --> 00:05:43,968
But I'm here if you need me
to trample her!

94
00:05:44,552 --> 00:05:45,803
[grunting]

95
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:48,222

[squawking]

97
00:05:54,687 --> 00:05:57,982
What, did you come to finish the job
you started five years ago?

98
00:05:58,066 --> 00:06:00,151
[grunts]
I just wanna talk!

99
00:06:00,234 --> 00:06:02,945
[grunts]
Talk? You don't know me very well.

100
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:05,448
[yelling]

101
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:10,328

102
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:14,832
-Say the word, Wolf.
-Kipo, no.

103
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:16,501
Was that a "Kipo, now?"

104
00:06:16,584 --> 00:06:18,169
[grunting]

105
00:06:18,503 --> 00:06:21,047
If you're not trying to kill me...
[grunts]

106
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:22,465
Then why did you trap me?

107
00:06:22,548 --> 00:06:24,383
-[grunts]
-Whoa!

108
00:06:24,467 --> 00:06:26,344
'Cause I thought
that you'd try to kill me!

109
00:06:26,427 --> 00:06:28,137
Well, you got one thing right!

110
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:30,348
Um, I'm sorry, but who is this?

111
00:06:30,431 --> 00:06:31,933
[grunting]

112
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:37,522
Please. I... I just need your help.

113
00:06:39,857 --> 00:06:41,442
Oh, it's over?

114
00:06:41,526 --> 00:06:43,653
But you're both still alive.

115
00:06:46,405 --> 00:06:48,324
How did you know where to find us?

116
00:06:48,407 --> 00:06:50,743
There's a bunch of otters
doing a whole play about you.

117
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:53,704
-It includes your address and everything.
-Why would you need my help?

118
00:06:53,788 --> 00:06:55,832
We were scavenging
in Deathstalker territory,

119
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:56,749
and got cornered.

120
00:06:56,833 --> 00:07:00,002
I escaped, but...
my brother Rupert's trapped.

121
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:02,130
I didn't know who else to turn to.

122
00:07:02,213 --> 00:07:04,966
You're the only person I know
who's escaped those scorpions.

123
00:07:05,049 --> 00:07:07,760
Um, why should we believe you?

124
00:07:07,844 --> 00:07:10,179
You're the wolf who pretended to be
our Wolf's best friend,

125
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:12,306
and then hunted her.
How dare you.

126
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:16,644
You're about to feel the wrath of
a Human Mute Ultimate Friendship Alliance!

127
00:07:16,727 --> 00:07:19,856
Despite our welcoming name,
we bring the pain!

128
00:07:21,357 --> 00:07:25,695
Guys, this is Wolf's decision.
We need to respect her choice.

129
00:07:25,778 --> 00:07:29,031
Because we're real friends
who would never betray her!

130
00:07:29,991 --> 00:07:31,826
[sighs]
I'll do it.

131
00:07:31,909 --> 00:07:34,245
Yeah, what she said.
Wait, what?

132
00:07:34,328 --> 00:07:37,165
-Really?
-You don't deserve my help.

133
00:07:37,498 --> 00:07:39,876
But if there's one thing
I've learned from Kipo,

134
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:42,086
it's that I should help you anyway.

135
00:07:42,628 --> 00:07:46,257
Because it's the right thing to do,
and I'm a nice person.

136
00:07:46,632 --> 00:07:49,802
Somewhere deep, very deep inside.

137
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:51,804
-Deep.
-Yeah!

138
00:07:51,888 --> 00:07:53,764
OK, we're doing this!

139
00:07:53,848 --> 00:07:56,267
Uh, but who's gonna get
Scarlemagne to apologize?

140
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:57,602
-Yumyan?
-You are.

141
00:07:57,685 --> 00:07:59,770
Stay here.
HMUFA needs you.

142
00:07:59,854 --> 00:08:02,523
Besides, your job is gonna be
way harder than mine.

143
00:08:02,607 --> 00:08:03,983
Hmm.

144
00:08:06,277 --> 00:08:09,906
And if this is a trap,
I'll be wearing you next.

145
00:08:11,616 --> 00:08:13,784
[crowd cheering]

146
00:08:19,081 --> 00:08:20,041
Oh!

148
00:08:26,464 --> 00:08:27,465
[grunts]

149
00:08:32,136 --> 00:08:34,722
-[man] Hey, what's he doing here?
-[woman] I don't wanna see him!

150
00:08:34,805 --> 00:08:36,516
Let's throw stuff at him!

151
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:38,434
Boo!

152
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:41,437
Oh, yeah, boo me.

153
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:44,857
You know what?
Boo, you guys! Boo, you!

154
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:48,736
-Stop throwing stuff!
-Ooh, actually, could I have some of that?

155
00:08:50,571 --> 00:08:52,949
I'm trying to show him
what community means.

156
00:08:53,574 --> 00:08:56,369
Let's work together to wipe down his cage.

157
00:08:56,452 --> 00:08:58,621
So we can throw more stuff at his cage!

158
00:08:58,704 --> 00:09:00,540
[all cheering]

159
00:09:01,499 --> 00:09:02,875
I see what the problem is.

160
00:09:05,628 --> 00:09:07,713
[gasping]

161
00:09:08,673 --> 00:09:09,924
Uh, what are you doing?

162
00:09:10,007 --> 00:09:12,760
You can't get to know people
from behind a piece of glass.

163
00:09:12,843 --> 00:09:16,722
So... I'm showing you some trust.

164
00:09:17,348 --> 00:09:19,350
[screaming]

165
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:21,394
That's OK.

166
00:09:21,477 --> 00:09:24,188
It's just gonna take them
a minute to see what I... [yells]

167
00:09:24,272 --> 00:09:27,149
[laughing]

168
00:09:29,819 --> 00:09:32,071
[grunts, laughs]

169
00:09:32,321 --> 00:09:33,489
Oh!

170
00:09:34,031 --> 00:09:36,200
[snorting]

171
00:09:37,743 --> 00:09:39,370
Ready to get started?

172
00:09:39,453 --> 00:09:40,538
[groans]

173
00:09:53,676 --> 00:09:56,095
We're not taking our eyes off you.

174
00:09:56,178 --> 00:09:58,431
Yeah.
I haven't blinked in hours.

175
00:09:58,514 --> 00:10:01,267
It was fine for a while,
and then it became painful.

176
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:03,436
Now, it's fine again.

177
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:05,730
Ow! Nope, it's... it's... it's...
it's bad again.

178
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:07,398
Do they have to come along?

179
00:10:07,481 --> 00:10:10,234
Like we'd let her
go anywhere alone with you.

180
00:10:10,318 --> 00:10:11,235
[yells]

181
00:10:14,697 --> 00:10:17,617
[sighs]
Thank you, true friend.

182
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,493
And to think you tried to eat her!

186
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:41,891
Oh, man!
I hate chasing Wolf.

187
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:44,602
How are they so fast?
Their legs are so short.

188
00:10:44,685 --> 00:10:46,103
Dude, I know!

189
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:48,898
[grunts]

190
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:55,363
Wow, you're still really fast.

191
00:10:57,782 --> 00:11:00,242
[panting]
Of course, she is!

192
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:04,121
She's been running for her life
every day of her... life!

193
00:11:04,205 --> 00:11:06,374
My life hasn't been easy either.

194
00:11:06,457 --> 00:11:08,417
Oh-ho, boo hoo.

195
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:10,836
Benson, you got eyes on her?
I gotta sneeze.

196
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13,255
I'm dialed in.
Go for it.

197
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:14,799
[both sneeze]

198
00:11:14,882 --> 00:11:16,550
-[gasps] Oh, no!
-Oh, no!

199
00:11:16,634 --> 00:11:18,594
Did she stab you in your back
while we sneezed?

200
00:11:18,677 --> 00:11:20,471
-Wha... I... No!
-Likely story.

201
00:11:20,554 --> 00:11:22,056
Guys, I'm fine.
Cut it out.

202
00:11:23,307 --> 00:11:25,267
See?
No back-stabbing.

203
00:11:25,768 --> 00:11:26,811
Let's go.

[guitars strumming]

205
00:11:35,611 --> 00:11:37,696
Hey, guys.
Nobody slither away.

206
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:40,491
OK, you may know Scarlemagne
from trying to melt you--

207
00:11:40,574 --> 00:11:42,660
Uh, that's exactly how we know him!

208
00:11:42,743 --> 00:11:46,038
But this time he's here to melt...
your hearts.

209
00:11:46,122 --> 00:11:48,874
For the record, I don't want to be here.

210
00:11:50,084 --> 00:11:52,294
[grunting]

211
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:55,297
-Honestly, just put me back in the cage.
-No.

212
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:57,425
So, is there anything
he can help you with?

213
00:11:58,092 --> 00:11:58,968
Hmm.

214
00:11:59,051 --> 00:12:00,928
Ten fingers, huh?

215
00:12:01,637 --> 00:12:03,013
Is this acoustic?

216
00:12:03,097 --> 00:12:06,350
You know, the secret
to tuning a guitar is... [yells]

No, no. I...
Don't cry! It's OK

00:13:16,962 --> 00:13:18,547
Shh. OK. Uh, look!

239
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:21,175
Uh, you're,
you're a fierce little timberkitten!

240
00:13:21,425 --> 00:13:23,260
-I am?
-Yes, you are.

00:13:25,262 --> 00:13:26,805
[soft roar]

00:13:29,892 --> 00:13:33,187
Oh, no!
Aah!

243
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:35,606
Timberkittens and snakelets
are chasing me!

You don't scare me, Scarlemagne!

[barking]

249
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:54,500
Can't we go around?

250
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:56,961
Aren't you in a rush
to get to your brother?

251
00:13:57,044 --> 00:13:59,463
I am.
We're no good to him if we're dead.

252
00:13:59,547 --> 00:14:01,966
And you're no good to him alive.

253
00:14:02,049 --> 00:14:04,468
-Too far?
-Not far enough.

-It's OK.

There's too many feet!

261
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:28,993
We're gonna get squished like bugs!

262
00:14:29,076 --> 00:14:31,579
-At least you're immortal.
-He's what?

263
00:14:31,662 --> 00:14:34,081
No time to explain.
Which one's the alpha, Margot?

264
00:14:34,164 --> 00:14:36,125
[stutters]
You're asking me? I don't know!

265
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:38,627
Yes, you do.
You're a wolf! Focus.

[grunts]

270
00:15:00,107 --> 00:15:03,485
Wolf, you're too far!
I can't see if she's stabbing you!

271
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:06,655
Is she stabbing you now?
What about now?

272
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:07,823
Now is she stabbing you?

273
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:12,286
[howling]

274
00:15:20,377 --> 00:15:24,548
Are Wolf and Margot, like,
in charge of those dogs now?

275
00:15:24,632 --> 00:15:27,134
-Ooh, I'm gonna ride in his ear!
-Dibs on the other ear!

276
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:29,386
That was amazing!

277
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:31,680
It was like we were
reading each other's minds.

278
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:35,726
Or like we were raised
by the same monsters.

279
00:15:39,063 --> 00:15:41,231
[indistinct chatter]

280
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:49,156
Are you ready?
Just like we practiced.

281
00:15:49,239 --> 00:15:50,658
We didn't practice anything.

282
00:15:50,741 --> 00:15:53,702
Exactly.
Because an apology comes from your heart.

283
00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:02,336
Why is this so important to you?

284
00:16:02,419 --> 00:16:05,172
Because if I can't get
all the mutes to come together,

285
00:16:05,255 --> 00:16:07,675
then I'll never convince the humans
that Emilia's wrong!

286
00:16:07,758 --> 00:16:10,427
And friendship loses forever and ever.

287
00:16:10,511 --> 00:16:14,264
If that's all you want,
then why don't you just get rid of me?

288
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:17,643
Because it's not all I want.

289
00:16:18,102 --> 00:16:20,437
I want you to have a second chance.

290
00:16:24,942 --> 00:16:26,777
[snorts]

291
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:29,530
Oh, calm down.
I'm not going anywhere.

292
00:16:30,572 --> 00:16:36,036
Thank you all for coming
to this very special meeting of HMUFA!

293
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,665
[man] Yay.

294
00:16:40,249 --> 00:16:42,167
OK, that's a start.

295
00:16:42,251 --> 00:16:47,464
Anyway, ever since the Battle of Aurum,
we've become so much stronger together.

296
00:16:47,548 --> 00:16:49,842
But there's something
keeping some of us apart.

297
00:16:49,925 --> 00:16:52,011
Scarlemagne, could you please come up?

298
00:16:52,094 --> 00:16:53,387
[crowd murmuring]

299
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:57,141
[clears throat]
Hello... everyone.

300
00:16:57,224 --> 00:16:58,434
[all] Boo!

301
00:16:58,517 --> 00:17:01,103
-Go away!
-You're not wanted here!

302
00:17:02,438 --> 00:17:04,606
I just wanted to say that...

303
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:08,402
often in life,
we are faced with summer storms.

304
00:17:08,485 --> 00:17:11,238
Sometimes we are
the thirsty roots of a tree,

305
00:17:11,321 --> 00:17:15,117
and others,
the bird thrashing in the wind.

306
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:18,704
Even so, the rain must fall.

307
00:17:18,787 --> 00:17:22,332
But the clouds will always
make way for the sun.

308
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:23,667
Do you see what I mean?

309
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:28,130
Are you calling us trees?

310
00:17:28,213 --> 00:17:29,048
No. No!

311
00:17:29,131 --> 00:17:32,509
Oh, he's saying we're too dumb
to know how rain falls!

312
00:17:32,843 --> 00:17:34,094
That's not... that's not what I--

313
00:17:34,178 --> 00:17:38,682
First, you destroy our homes,
and now you're calling us dumb trees!

314
00:17:38,766 --> 00:17:39,892
You're the tree!

315
00:17:39,975 --> 00:17:42,644
[indistinct yelling]

316
00:17:46,523 --> 00:17:48,442
You guys! Stop!

317
00:17:48,525 --> 00:17:50,486
We already did the throwing thing!

318
00:17:51,111 --> 00:17:54,448
[grunts] I said... stop!

319
00:18:03,165 --> 00:18:05,918
I've done terrible things to you.

320
00:18:06,668 --> 00:18:09,338
And in return,
you've shown me... patience.

321
00:18:10,297 --> 00:18:12,341
I don't deserve your forgiveness,

322
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:14,676
and I don't expect
anything to change after today.

323
00:18:15,636 --> 00:18:20,307
But... for what it's worth, I am sorry.

324
00:18:23,977 --> 00:18:27,272
Wow.
Give it up for Scarlemagne, everyone!

325
00:18:27,898 --> 00:18:29,233
[man] Yay.

326
00:18:29,316 --> 00:18:32,027
Oh, come on!
You can't say you didn't feel that.

327
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:33,445
No, we did.

328
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:37,074
But we also feel...
incredibly scared!

329
00:18:37,157 --> 00:18:40,953
Two emotions swirling together
like a beautiful vortex.

330
00:18:41,328 --> 00:18:43,413
Kipo, we can't forgive Scarlemagne yet.

331
00:18:44,498 --> 00:18:46,750
But you made a safe zone in my heart.

332
00:18:46,834 --> 00:18:49,002
-We'll join HMUFA.
-Really?

333
00:18:49,086 --> 00:18:53,549
It took a lot of heavy lifting
to get Scarlemagne to apologize.

334
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:56,510
-I'll spot you any time.
-Yes!

335
00:18:56,593 --> 00:18:58,720
Ohh, I wish I had confetti right now.

336
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:01,598
Welcome to HMUFA!

337
00:19:01,682 --> 00:19:05,978
[all chanting]
HMUFA! HMUFA! HMUFA!

338
00:19:06,061 --> 00:19:08,730
HMUFA! HMUFA!

339
00:19:10,399 --> 00:19:13,944
So... maybe this could be
an everyday thing?

340
00:19:14,361 --> 00:19:17,823
-What, the apology?
-No, walking around the village.

341
00:19:17,906 --> 00:19:20,284
For a little bit.
Get to know everyone.

342
00:19:20,367 --> 00:19:21,201
If you'd like.

343
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:24,663
Hmm.
I'll consider it.

344
00:19:25,205 --> 00:19:27,749
Oh...
I knew there was a good guy in there.

345
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:31,420
Yes, I know.
Deep, deep down.

346
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:33,005
Very deep.

347
00:19:34,965 --> 00:19:36,175
Deep.

348
00:19:36,258 --> 00:19:38,343
[giggles]
Not so deep anymore.

349
00:19:39,887 --> 00:19:40,721

351
00:19:45,726 --> 00:19:47,477
It was you, wasn't it?

352
00:19:48,896 --> 00:19:50,689
[howling]

353
00:19:52,816 --> 00:19:54,234
[whining]

354
00:19:55,485 --> 00:19:58,614
Remember, the most important thing
is to stay calm,

355
00:19:58,697 --> 00:20:01,408
so the deathstalkers
can't see your heartbeat.

356
00:20:01,491 --> 00:20:04,286
[sighs]

357
00:20:05,662 --> 00:20:07,414
[whimpers]

358
00:20:16,924 --> 00:20:19,718
Wow!
You actually lived here?

359
00:20:19,801 --> 00:20:22,804
That's impressive.
No, it... it's amazing.

360
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:25,432
No. No, you don't get to do that.

361
00:20:25,515 --> 00:20:26,892
You don't get to be my friend.

362
00:20:26,975 --> 00:20:27,851
Wolf, you tell her!

363
00:20:27,935 --> 00:20:30,395
Do you know what it was like
to find out the people

364
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:33,315
I thought were my family
only saw me as food?

365
00:20:33,398 --> 00:20:36,401
So messed up.
And then what happened?

366
00:20:36,485 --> 00:20:39,863
I had to fall asleep every night
knowing that nobody in the world

367
00:20:39,947 --> 00:20:42,324
was thinking about me.
Or even cared that I was afraid.

368
00:20:42,407 --> 00:20:45,494
Of course, I cared.
You were my sister.

369
00:20:45,577 --> 00:20:48,497
But our... my parents...

370
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:50,999
they made me think I didn't have a choice.

371
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:52,084
I was scared.

372
00:20:52,167 --> 00:20:54,419
You don't abandon your friends
when you're scared.

373
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:57,047
That's when you need them the most.

374
00:20:57,130 --> 00:21:01,260
Wow.
That should be a rule of the surface.

375
00:21:02,511 --> 00:21:05,097
I'm glad you found the pack you deserve.

376
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:07,683
So, where is he?

377
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:13,522
I'm... supposed to take you
to the parking garage.

378
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:14,564
What?

379
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:18,193
She captured us.
She said she'd take away our minds,

380
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:19,569
turn us into animals.

381
00:21:19,653 --> 00:21:22,322
But she'd let us go
if I brought you to her.

382
00:21:22,406 --> 00:21:24,574
She wants to use you to get Kipo.

383
00:21:24,658 --> 00:21:26,326
-Emilia!
-Mandu!

384
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:28,578
Aah, Emilia... makes more sense.

385
00:21:28,662 --> 00:21:31,206
-You walked us into a trap?
-Not yet.

386
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:33,208
I'll figure out another way
to save my brother,

387
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:35,085
but you can still get out of here.

388
00:21:35,168 --> 00:21:36,086
[footsteps approaching]

389
00:21:36,795 --> 00:21:38,672
No, they can't.

390
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:43,302
[music playing]
