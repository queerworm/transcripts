Huh! Ha!

185
00:12:15,276 --> 00:12:16,152
Hugo!

[groaning]

198
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:39,235
Kipo. Where's Emilia going?

199
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:41,445
I don't know. She just ran away.

200
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:43,614
Go after her. We'll find Hugo.

201
00:13:57,211 --> 00:14:00,005

00:14:14,603 --> 00:14:16,981

[groaning]

205
00:14:29,743 --> 00:14:32,663
What's wrong with her?
She just looks... scared.

206
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:37,626
Emilia never had an anchor.
She lost herself in the mega!

207
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:42,214
She's just gone? No more evil,
mute-hating brain in there?

208
00:14:42,298 --> 00:14:46,176
You know, we could just leave her
like this. She's harmless.

209
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:48,721
I mean, this way
it's way better for everyone.

210
00:14:50,848 --> 00:14:55,102
No. She deserves to be punished
but not like this.

211
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:05,988

Ouf.

215
00:15:51,033 --> 00:15:53,118
You brought me back. Why?

216
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:58,040
Nobody deserves to have their mind
taken away from them. Not even you.

217
00:15:58,123 --> 00:16:00,918
That's not the world I wanna live in.

218
00:16:01,001 --> 00:16:06,131
You've lived in darkness for so long,
but you have a choice, Emilia.

219
00:16:06,215 --> 00:16:10,052
You can stay there
or you can fight through it.

[Mandu snorts]

228
00:16:51,051 --> 00:16:52,386
Any of us could be next.

229
00:16:52,469 --> 00:16:57,474
I see you, Mandu, acting all cute,
licking your hooves, but you're ice cold.

230
00:16:57,558 --> 00:17:00,060
-That's a good girl, Mandu.
-[squeals]

231

Trapped in her old burrow with a mute

232
00:17:02,187 --> 00:17:04,898
that wants nothing more
than to be her best friend.

233
00:17:04,982 --> 00:17:06,900
I guess that's as good
a punishment as any.

234
00:17:07,568 --> 00:17:08,527
It's over.

235
00:17:21,415 --> 00:17:22,291

No, no. No!

238
00:17:36,805 --> 00:17:38,390
Did we win the day?

239
00:17:41,226 --> 00:17:44,438
Not to brag but... I totally saved you.

240
00:17:44,521 --> 00:17:46,899
You did, but you shouldn't have.

241
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:49,526
You shouldn't have helped me.

242
00:17:50,486 --> 00:17:51,653
But you did.

243
00:17:52,446 --> 00:17:55,741
And because of that,
I got to have a family.

00:17:56,575 --> 00:17:58,994
-[groans]
-Scarlemagne?

245
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:01,580

[Mandu groans softly]

247
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:24,978

the sriracha peanut butter?

-Two bottles.
-How 'bout Dave's potato noodles?

259
00:19:30,502 --> 00:19:31,753
It's all in there.

Say hi to everyone.

The Earth is not flat! It's round.

271
00:20:15,756 --> 00:20:17,883
And the reason why we don't fall off?

Anyone? Anyone? Tad?

274
00:20:23,305 --> 00:20:27,267
That's right! It's because
we are all made of magnets.

Nailed it.

276
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:31,772
We have to stop letting him guest lecture.

I mean, how do you know
we're not made of magnets, hmm?

So, that's what everyone's been up to.
Life is good. Las Vistas is amazing.
