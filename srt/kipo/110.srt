We are under attack.

Hey!

I know who sent you.

00:01:06,983 --> 00:01:08,443

00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:49,901
Did everyone make it through OK?

30
00:01:49,984 --> 00:01:52,445
Not quite. I had to get Kipo out
through the aqueduct.

31
00:01:52,529 --> 00:01:54,405
Why would you do that?

32
00:01:54,489 --> 00:01:58,118
If the burrow is ever breached,
you are to report here to the bunker.

33
00:01:58,201 --> 00:02:01,496
-We have to evacuate to Site B.
-What is Site B?

34
00:02:01,579 --> 00:02:04,999
The council kept it a secret
so it could never be compromised.

35
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:06,960
-Out there is a labyrinth...
-[all gasping]

36
00:02:07,043 --> 00:02:10,171
of ancient subway tunnels
and sewer canals.

37
00:02:10,255 --> 00:02:13,842
And at the heart of it
is a fully-equipped back-up burrow.

38
00:02:13,925 --> 00:02:14,843
Our new home.

39
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:17,720
I have to go up to the surface
to find Kipo!

40
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:20,348
If I had known there was a backup,
I never would have sent her up there.

41
00:02:20,473 --> 00:02:23,852
Well, I'm sorry
you didn't follow Burrow protocol.

42
00:02:23,935 --> 00:02:28,273
But if you ever want to find Site B,
you will march with us.

43
00:02:33,403 --> 00:02:36,364
I'll get you there, Kipo.
I promise.

You've been making lots of noise

Word around town is...

47
00:03:07,896 --> 00:03:10,857
Scarlemagne's put a bounty
on your heads.

48
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:14,110
We heard you took out four crews
with explosive nectar.

49
00:03:14,193 --> 00:03:16,112
I'm impressed.

50
00:03:16,195 --> 00:03:19,324
But, not enough to take you
through that dog park.

51
00:03:19,407 --> 00:03:22,285
It's the one thing
we absolutely cannot do.

52
00:03:22,368 --> 00:03:27,123
We are Timbercats, which means,
we don't go near dogs.

53
00:03:27,457 --> 00:03:29,918
It's kind of an ancient rivalry thing.

-Yeah, that we could do.

56
00:03:36,591 --> 00:03:40,011
Um, excuse me, Molly,
I am not loaning them Pierre.

57
00:03:40,094 --> 00:03:43,389
They opened the tuna can, and you ate it.
You know the rules.

He'd get dog slobber on him!

It would take weeks
to get that stench out.

60
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:52,148
-And I just gave Pierre a bath.
-Here. He's really good at jumping.

61
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:57,445
I'm the one who gets to decide which human
can borrow my personal war parasite.

D'oh!

64
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:07,622
Just... make sure you bring him
back to me in one piece.

-[Wolf] What?

I'm glad you came back.

-Me, too.
-Hey, look! Check it out!

69
00:04:31,062 --> 00:04:33,856
Dandelion puffs!
There's a superstition about these.

00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:50,832
See? Good luck.

77
00:04:53,167 --> 00:04:55,044
I think he just wants to play with us.

78
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:57,755

Don't even suggest it!

I'm so glad you came back!

94
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:38,463
Can we take a quick moment
to appreciate that?

95
00:05:38,546 --> 00:05:41,758
[Wolf]
Can that moment be any time, but now?

96
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:44,552
[Kipo] Fine! But promise me
we'll hug it out later.

97
00:05:44,635 --> 00:05:47,555
-We already hugged!
-Only once!

We're here!

Look for the entrance to my burrow!

115
00:06:51,494 --> 00:06:53,996
I don't know what it looks like,
but it's probably hidden.

116
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:57,250
So, look for something you can't find.

117

It's you.

123
00:07:18,229 --> 00:07:20,731
I followed your clues.
They were hard to follow.

124
00:07:20,815 --> 00:07:23,526
Well, I had to make sure
no else could follow them.

125
00:07:23,609 --> 00:07:25,403
Oh, well,
you did a good job of that.

I can't thank you all enough.

Kipo is everything to me.
And you brought her back.

139
00:08:24,045 --> 00:08:27,215
The pleasure is all ours, Mister...

140
00:08:27,298 --> 00:08:29,342
I'm not sure
what we're supposed to call you.

141

-Mr. Kipo?
-My students call me Mr. Oak.

142
00:08:32,094 --> 00:08:34,764
But until you're in my class,
you can call me Lio.

143
00:08:34,847 --> 00:08:39,727
This is so crazy! Benson, Wolf, Dave,
we could all be in dad's class together!

144
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:42,647
Instead of running for our lives
every second, we'll all be students!

Passing notes to each other,
cramming for exams...

[gasps] Dad!

147
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:49,570
-[chuckles] We already hugged.
-It was only once.

148
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:56,869
Nothing quite like that beautiful...

[Lio and Kipo] Oxidation of luciferin.

-Kipo is definitely that man's daughter.
-Pfft. Nerds! Heh.

151
00:09:04,168 --> 00:09:06,504
-It is cute though.
-Everyone follow me.

152
00:09:06,587 --> 00:09:08,464
You all must be hungry and exhausted.

153
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:10,341
Were you kids living alone out there?

154
00:09:10,424 --> 00:09:13,594
Objection!
I think I qualify as an adult.

155
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:15,263
At least until I molt again.

156
00:09:15,346 --> 00:09:18,307
Me and Dave weren't alone.
We've been a team since forever.

157
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:20,977
Yeah, Dad, they're amazing!

158
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:23,896
Benson and Dave know everything
about everything on the surface.

159
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:27,650
Wolf was totally solo before we met,
but she's, like, a superhero.

160
00:09:27,733 --> 00:09:29,860
She's definitely the toughest person
I've ever met.

161
00:09:29,944 --> 00:09:31,445
No way I'd have made it home without her.

162
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:32,989
You're a survivor, aren't you?

163
00:09:33,072 --> 00:09:35,658
And the youngest warrior
I think I've ever seen.

164
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:40,246
Um...

165
00:09:40,329 --> 00:09:45,668
Before we go in, no one in our community
has seen mutes or surface people before.

166
00:09:45,751 --> 00:09:47,920
So there may be a period of adjustment.

167
00:09:49,005 --> 00:09:51,507
This is Ram's Horn.
I've found Aries.

Dad?

349
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:18,133
What are you doing?

350
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:21,887
No! We cannot go out there.
That's Scarlemagne.

351
00:20:23,972 --> 00:20:27,601
Now isn't this a surprise?
My old pal, Lio.

352
00:20:27,684 --> 00:20:31,146
How are you?
I do so miss your visits.

353
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:36,151
-Hugo. It's been a long time.
-Oh, I go by Scarlemagne now.

354
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:38,862
Has a nice ring to it, don't you think?

355
00:20:39,279 --> 00:20:43,283
So, never mention that other name again
or I'll have you stuffed!

356
00:20:43,575 --> 00:20:45,369
Your dad knows Scarlemagne?!

357
00:20:45,452 --> 00:20:46,828
[Lio] What do you want from us?

358
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:47,996
I guess?

359
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,791
I'd like you to all
to join my army, of course!

360
00:20:50,874 --> 00:20:54,461
But now that we're happily reunited,
I wonder,

361
00:20:54,878 --> 00:20:57,547
where's that bundle of joy of yours?

362
00:20:58,006 --> 00:21:00,217
You do have a daughter, if I remember.

363
00:21:00,425 --> 00:21:03,845
-She must be grown up by now.
-You'll never find her.

364
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:08,016
Ooh, making it a game!
Fine, more fun that way.

365
