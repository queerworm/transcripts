00:10:52,943 --> 00:10:57,281
[grunting]
Kipo. My name's Kipo.

182
00:10:57,365 --> 00:10:59,492
And... and I really need
your help right now.

183
00:10:59,575 --> 00:11:02,161
You're not gone?
That's annoying.

184
00:11:02,244 --> 00:11:04,205
Look, there was a mute-quake.

185
00:11:04,288 --> 00:11:06,666
A lot of people I care about
could be hurt.

186
00:11:06,749 --> 00:11:08,417
I really need to get home.

187
00:11:09,085 --> 00:11:10,670
Not my problem.

188
00:11:11,253 --> 00:11:13,714
Hey. Hey!

189
00:11:13,798 --> 00:11:15,466
[sighs]

190
00:11:15,549 --> 00:11:18,969
First lesson of the surface:
Up here, you don't shout like that.

191
00:11:19,053 --> 00:11:20,721
It's called "ringing the dinner bell."

192
00:11:20,805 --> 00:11:21,972
Free advice.

193
00:11:24,642 --> 00:11:26,977
Hey, you, wolf girl!

194
00:11:27,061 --> 00:11:29,897
Yeah!
You, walking away from me!

195
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:32,983
I'm still talking to you!

196
00:11:33,567 --> 00:11:35,903
Fine.
I don't need you anyway.

197
00:11:35,986 --> 00:11:39,031
[grunts] I'll find my own way--
[groans]

198
00:11:40,282 --> 00:11:44,036
Oh, hi.
You look friendly.

199
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,413
[gasps]

200
00:11:46,288 --> 00:11:48,749
That's your last freebie.

201
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:50,960
Fine.
I'll just go this way instead.

202
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:54,755
Really? You're just gonna walk
right into Death Ivy?

203
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:57,591
Whoa.

204
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:02,930
[groans]
You're not gonna last five minutes.

205
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:07,476
Look, I'll help you get home.

206
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,311
But once you're back, I'm out.

207
00:12:09,437 --> 00:12:12,982
-Up here, I work alone. Got it?
-Oh, thank you!

208
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:14,775
No hugging.

209
00:12:14,859 --> 00:12:16,902
I knew you were a good person.

210
00:12:17,987 --> 00:12:20,114
Hey, I just realized
I don't know your name.

211
00:12:20,197 --> 00:12:23,325
-No talking!
-Uh, OK.

212
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:24,827
I'll just call you "Wolf", then.

213
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:26,704
I've already been calling you
that in my head.

214
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:29,748
At first we thought it
was a mute passing overhead.

215
00:12:29,832 --> 00:12:31,250
I mean, that happens all the time, right?

216
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:33,461
We learned a long time ago
to anchor all tall furniture.

217
00:12:33,544 --> 00:12:37,465
But this one was, like, an earthquake.
I can't imagine how big it was.

218
00:12:37,548 --> 00:12:40,509
It made an entire cliff fall...
while I was on it.

219
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:43,721
And then, I landed in
the water supply tube and nearly drowned.

220
00:12:43,804 --> 00:12:45,764
[gulps] Sounds like a Tuesday.

221
00:12:45,848 --> 00:12:47,433
Listen, Kipo, was it?

222
00:12:47,516 --> 00:12:50,561
Lesson two of the surface:
Don't ever tell anyone that story.

223
00:12:50,644 --> 00:12:53,439
It could be very dangerous
if people know you're from a burrow.

224
00:12:53,522 --> 00:12:57,276
And lesson three of the surface:
Up here, you never pass up a meal.

225
00:13:02,907 --> 00:13:05,201
Crispy on the outside,
chewy in the center.

226
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:08,871
Can you tell me anything about your burrow
that might help us find it?

227
00:13:09,121 --> 00:13:12,416
Oh, well, there's the underground
irrigation system...

228
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:14,293
which is underground.

229
00:13:15,085 --> 00:13:18,088
[gasps]
Oh, wait! The Clover!

230
00:13:18,172 --> 00:13:20,216
How could I forget the Clover?

231
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:22,593
We live under this barrier called
The Great Clover.

232
00:13:22,676 --> 00:13:25,888
I've never actually seen it,
but we use it as our city emblem.

233
00:13:26,805 --> 00:13:29,808
Hmm. I may know what that is.

234
00:13:30,142 --> 00:13:31,810
We'll make camp here for the night.

235
00:13:31,894 --> 00:13:34,021
For the night... out here?

236
00:13:34,104 --> 00:13:38,317
Uh, my dad must be really worried
about me right now, so...

237
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,818
[roar echoes]

238
00:13:39,902 --> 00:13:42,988
Uh, did you hear that?
Because I definitely did.

239
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:45,074
It feels like something
we should worry about.

240
00:13:45,157 --> 00:13:46,242
[groaning]

241
00:13:51,622 --> 00:13:57,211
So many sparkles!
I was not prepared.

242
00:13:57,586 --> 00:13:59,255
Why would humans stay underground

243
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:02,091
when every night they could
look up and see this?

244
00:14:03,801 --> 00:14:07,346
Yeah, it's a real paradise.

245
00:14:08,931 --> 00:14:11,850
That must be the Big Dipper!
It's part of Ursa Major.

246
00:14:11,934 --> 00:14:15,646
I'm kind of an astronomy buff
even though I've never seen a sky before.

247
00:14:15,729 --> 00:14:19,066
Ooh! And that bright one, that's Polaris!

248
00:14:19,149 --> 00:14:21,026
You see the one
that doesn't make any noise?

249
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:23,571
Well, none of them make... Oh.

250
00:14:23,654 --> 00:14:26,073
[chuckles nervously]
OK. I'll be quiet.

251
00:14:26,156 --> 00:14:27,366
You get sleep.

252
00:14:29,118 --> 00:14:32,037
[gasps]
Aries! That's my birth sign.

253
00:14:32,121 --> 00:14:33,247
I've always wanted to see it!

254
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:36,208
It's supposed to be a ram
if you connect the dots.

255
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:37,751
I guess you can kinda see it
if you squint right--

256
00:14:37,835 --> 00:14:39,879
-[Wolf] Kipo!
-Oh, right.

257
00:14:39,962 --> 00:14:41,881
[chuckles]
Shh.

258
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:48,345
[clattering]

259
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:52,766
Anything that looks useful, take.

260
00:15:00,441 --> 00:15:04,278
"October 23rd, 2020."

261
00:15:04,361 --> 00:15:08,532
Yeah, it's expired by about 200 years.

262
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:15,247
-Found it!
-Spot remover?

263
00:15:15,331 --> 00:15:16,916
That's for getting out shirt stains.

264
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:20,002
No offense,
yours may need a full spin cycle.

265
00:15:22,004 --> 00:15:23,088
Mega Bunny.

266
00:15:23,172 --> 00:15:24,757
It's a good thing we're inside--
[yells]

267
00:15:25,841 --> 00:15:28,093
-Whoa!
-Definitely a Mega Bunny.

268
00:15:30,304 --> 00:15:32,473
I saw that same Mega Bunny earlier.

269
00:15:32,556 --> 00:15:35,267
I named her "Rabbecka."
The little ones are so cuddly!

270
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:37,394
You touched the babies?

271
00:15:37,478 --> 00:15:39,104
-[grunts]
-[exclaims]

272
00:15:39,188 --> 00:15:40,564
Why did you touch the babies?

273
00:15:40,648 --> 00:15:42,733
Don't you know
you can't touch the babies?!

274
00:15:42,816 --> 00:15:44,443
But they were so cute.
[yells]

275
00:15:44,526 --> 00:15:47,154
Aisle six, baking goods.
Aisle seven, drinks.

276
00:15:47,655 --> 00:15:49,531
Aisle eight, bingo!

277
00:15:57,706 --> 00:16:00,209
[coughing]

278
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:02,628
Pretty sure you got
the baby scent off me.

279
00:16:02,711 --> 00:16:04,296
You can't be too careful.

280
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:06,256
Huh? Oh, all out.

281
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:07,341
Oh, thank goodness!

282
00:16:07,424 --> 00:16:08,926
It's a good thing
I found this second bottle.

283
00:16:09,009 --> 00:16:11,095
[groans]
You've gotta be kidding me!

284
00:16:11,178 --> 00:16:13,806
-[coughing]
-This one's Summer Rain.

285
00:16:20,729 --> 00:16:22,147
-[gasps]
-[pants]

286
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:25,025
That is way better than taking the stairs!

287
00:16:27,194 --> 00:16:30,781
If you run into anything,
act like you're from the surface.

288
00:16:30,864 --> 00:16:32,157
From the surface.
Got it.

289
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:35,869
Uh, what are you doing?

290
00:16:35,953 --> 00:16:38,122
[deep voice] I'm from the surface,
where life is hard.

291
00:16:38,205 --> 00:16:39,915
You gotta be tough as nails.

292
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:43,627
Iron and fire...
wearing dead animals.

293
00:16:43,711 --> 00:16:45,379
Good. You're catching on.

294
00:16:45,462 --> 00:16:47,381
This is my angry surface face.

295
00:16:47,464 --> 00:16:49,550
Hmm.
[normal voice] Whoa, what's that?

296
00:16:52,803 --> 00:16:56,181
[gasps] There's so much to see
when you're not in a cave!

297
00:16:56,265 --> 00:16:57,558
Focus, Kipo.

298
00:16:58,434 --> 00:17:00,853
[Kipo gasps] That must be it!

299
00:17:00,936 --> 00:17:03,439
It looks just like the clover
in our emblem.

300
00:17:04,356 --> 00:17:07,568
Wow. So, that's my home.

301
00:17:07,776 --> 00:17:09,319
It's half a day's walk from here,

302
00:17:09,653 --> 00:17:12,156
but we'll have to
get over Skyscraper Ridge.

303
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,996
-[Kipo] That looks dangerous.
-[Wolf] It is.

304
00:17:19,496 --> 00:17:23,417
I'm really sticking my neck out for you.
And for what?

305
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:26,670
I wish I knew how to repay you.

306
00:17:27,671 --> 00:17:29,798
Or if you wanted to come stay with me,

307
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:32,176
I'm sure there'd be
a place for you in my burrow.

308
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:35,804
And go all soft and mushy
like the rest of you mole people?

309
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:37,306
No, thanks.

310
00:17:37,681 --> 00:17:39,099
-[yells]
-[grunts]

311
00:17:41,977 --> 00:17:43,353
Humans.

312
00:17:45,189 --> 00:17:46,565
[grunting]

313
00:17:55,532 --> 00:17:57,034
[gasps] My shirt!

314
00:17:57,117 --> 00:17:57,951
[groans]

315
00:17:58,035 --> 00:17:59,369
[pants]
It won't come out!

316
00:17:59,453 --> 00:18:01,789
[groaning]
It's setting!

317
00:18:01,872 --> 00:18:04,458
[panting]
Careful! That's one of the Mod Frogs.

318
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:06,251
You do not wanna mess with them.

319
00:18:06,335 --> 00:18:07,961
You're a talking frog!

320
00:18:08,045 --> 00:18:09,671
-Mm-mm!
-Huh?

321
00:18:10,672 --> 00:18:11,673
[chuckles nervously]

322
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:15,594
I mean, I've seen tons
of talking frogs before...

323
00:18:16,011 --> 00:18:17,137
that wear suits.

324
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:19,014
No... No biggie.

325
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:23,102
What my friend here means to say is,
we have this!

326
00:18:23,977 --> 00:18:26,438
Spot remover!
Give it to me!

327
00:18:26,522 --> 00:18:28,565
If you let us go.

328
00:18:30,484 --> 00:18:34,822
[gasps]
Look, this is my private office.

329
00:18:34,905 --> 00:18:38,242
Was there an "enjoy the view"
sign on my door?

330
00:18:38,325 --> 00:18:39,201
I think not.

331
00:18:40,244 --> 00:18:44,164
We're Mega Bunny hunters.
We were just scouting.

332
00:18:44,248 --> 00:18:46,166
[groans]
Just give me the spot remover.

333
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:48,252
Then I'll decide what to do with you.

334
00:18:48,335 --> 00:18:49,461
-[gasps]
-Oops!

335
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:53,590
[shrieking]
Oh, thank... Huh?

336
00:18:55,384 --> 00:18:57,761
Mega Bunny hunters. Right.

337
00:18:57,845 --> 00:19:00,139
Looked more like a burrow girl to me.

338
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:02,808
Huh.

339
00:19:06,562 --> 00:19:09,731
[sighs] This does not get old.

340
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:13,902
Lesson five on the surface:
Looking up... gets you killed.

341
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:15,529
Whoa.

342
00:19:19,741 --> 00:19:20,701
[snorts]

343
00:19:20,784 --> 00:19:23,078
[gasps]
Mandu! You came back!

344
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:23,996
Here, girl!

345
00:19:24,538 --> 00:19:26,206
[snorts, squeals]

346
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:27,666
Something's wrong.

347
00:19:27,749 --> 00:19:30,294
Yeah, you're pointing
a nightmare stick at a tiny pig.

348
00:19:30,377 --> 00:19:32,129
How do you expect
the poor thing to react?

349
00:19:32,212 --> 00:19:33,213
[squeals]

350
00:19:33,797 --> 00:19:35,382
I'm not the one who spooked her.

351
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:40,971
Oh, burrow girl!
I figured out where you're from.

352
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:44,433
Shocker... a burrow!

353
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:48,187
You could lead us
to the mother lode of humans.

354
00:19:48,812 --> 00:19:50,480
-[grunts]
-[squeals]

355
00:19:50,564 --> 00:19:51,899
[frog] Ah, just a pig.

356
00:19:51,982 --> 00:19:54,067
-[gasps]
-[frog] Eh, at least now we have a snack.

357
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:56,278
-No.
-[squealing]

358
00:19:56,361 --> 00:19:57,613
I won't let them take her.

359
00:19:57,696 --> 00:19:59,323
And risk our necks for a mute?

360
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:01,617
See, this is why I work alone.

361
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:05,078
If you like to be alone so bad,
maybe you should be.

362
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:08,916
Put the pig down right now!

363
00:20:09,249 --> 00:20:11,793
Burrow girl, there you are.

364
00:20:12,502 --> 00:20:14,004
[chuckling]

365
00:20:14,338 --> 00:20:15,214
[whimpers]

366
00:20:16,465 --> 00:20:18,008
[sinister laughter]

367
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:24,890
Uh... That pig is a bloodthirsty killer.

368
00:20:24,973 --> 00:20:29,436
-She'll tear you limb from limb.
-Mm, yeah. I'll take my chances.

369
00:20:36,401 --> 00:20:37,694
[grunts]

370
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,952
Wolf! You came back!

371
00:20:45,035 --> 00:20:45,953
Yep.

372
00:20:46,036 --> 00:20:47,871
[grunting]

373
00:20:47,955 --> 00:20:48,914
[screaming]

374
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:52,876
-[exclaims]
-[yelps]

375
00:20:55,921 --> 00:20:56,797
[grunts]

376
00:20:59,341 --> 00:21:00,217
[gasps]

377
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:01,760
[grunting]

378
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:12,688
[gasps]
Is he dead?

379
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:16,692
No, but when he wakes up,
he'll have a bad headache...

380
00:21:17,192 --> 00:21:18,902
and possibly some memory loss.

381
00:21:20,487 --> 00:21:22,447
[panting]

382
00:21:23,031 --> 00:21:23,949
[grunts]

383
00:21:25,492 --> 00:21:26,535
We'll hole up here.

384
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:31,581
[grunts] Normally, at night,
I'd be at home doing my homework.

385
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:34,376
Eating a muffin.

386
00:21:34,459 --> 00:21:36,211
Not running away from homicidal frogs!

387
00:21:36,503 --> 00:21:37,337
Shh!

388
00:21:37,421 --> 00:21:39,464
[frog] Oh... Oh, my head.

389
00:21:39,548 --> 00:21:43,093
I... Wait a minute,
why are you following me?

390
00:21:43,176 --> 00:21:46,179
[henchman] Uh, Jamack,
we're looking for those humans.

391
00:21:46,263 --> 00:21:49,308
[Jamack] Oh, yeah, right.
Yeah, just... duh.

392
00:21:49,391 --> 00:21:51,560
Let's... let's get back to that then.

393
00:21:52,185 --> 00:21:53,353
Whew!

394
00:21:53,603 --> 00:21:56,189
Since we've had
our first fight and makeup,

395
00:21:56,273 --> 00:21:58,150
that makes us officially sisters.

396
00:21:58,233 --> 00:21:59,359
-Don't.
-Uh, right.

397
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:03,447
[gasps] There's a baby here.

398
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:04,990
Why is there a baby here?

399
00:22:05,073 --> 00:22:06,992
[grunting]

400
00:22:08,577 --> 00:22:10,329
We have to shut that thing up.

401
00:22:10,412 --> 00:22:11,705
[squealing]

402
00:22:11,788 --> 00:22:15,542
OK, we really need you to hush,
little baby.

403
00:22:15,625 --> 00:22:17,002
I'll put him to sleep.

404
00:22:17,085 --> 00:22:18,628
There's a slight chance this'll kill him.

405
00:22:18,712 --> 00:22:19,629
Don't you dare!

406
00:22:24,885 --> 00:22:27,012
A mute?
You gotta be kidding me!

407
00:22:27,095 --> 00:22:28,221
It's still a baby!

408
00:22:28,305 --> 00:22:29,639
[Jamack] Check every room!

409
00:22:29,723 --> 00:22:31,975
Shh, shh, shh!
[chuckles nervously]

410
00:22:32,059 --> 00:22:33,310
[shushing]

411
00:22:34,561 --> 00:22:36,021
[whimpers]

412
00:22:36,104 --> 00:22:38,023
Do you know any grub nursery rhymes?

413
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:40,275
[baby's cry echoes]
