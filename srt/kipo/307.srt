[panting]

7
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:25,692
Is the Mega Jaguar still following us?

8
00:00:25,775 --> 00:00:29,154
Uh, the Earth isn't shaking,
so I don't think so.

9
00:00:29,237 --> 00:00:32,157
Did you see the look on Kipo's face
when we cured those mutes?

10
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:33,783
Didn't sit right with me.

11
00:00:33,867 --> 00:00:36,453
And why didn't the cure work on her?

12
00:00:36,536 --> 00:00:38,038
The cure didn't affect her?

13
00:00:38,121 --> 00:00:42,208
Emilia used Kipo's DNA to make the cure.
She's immune!

14
00:00:42,292 --> 00:00:45,295
That Jaguar will destroy us
before she lets us cure the surface!

15
00:00:45,378 --> 00:00:46,671
You all saw her try to eat me!

16
00:00:46,755 --> 00:00:49,632
Kipo doesn't eat people.
We're gonna be fine!

17
00:00:49,716 --> 00:00:51,885
Besides, Dr. Emilia always has a plan.

Everyone to the boat. Now.

00:01:03,354 --> 00:01:07,192
[groans] Sorry. Sorry.

22
00:01:09,944 --> 00:01:13,865
Well, the good news is,
if Emilia's that upset, it means Kipo won.

23
00:01:13,948 --> 00:01:15,033
Right?

It's all right, brother.

You'll feel better once you
get your turtleneck back on.

29

[yelling] No, no, no.

[snorting]

32
00:02:02,622 --> 00:02:04,582
I told them they'd be safe here.

33
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:06,042
It's not your fault, Kipo.

34
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:08,586
Yeah, we'll find a way to fix this.

35
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:11,464
-Kipo!
-Are you okay?

36
00:02:11,548 --> 00:02:14,259
We saw Dr. Emilia
heading back to the boat, and...

37
00:02:14,342 --> 00:02:15,426
Song.

38
00:02:16,386 --> 00:02:19,848
She cut through the wall,
and they started curing everyone.

39
00:02:19,931 --> 00:02:23,268
It didn't work on me,
but it was our people, Dad.

40
00:02:23,351 --> 00:02:24,519
They did this.

41
00:02:24,602 --> 00:02:26,396
Oh, Kipo. Come here.

42
00:02:27,897 --> 00:02:30,567
Well, we've got everything
we need to make the vaccine.

43
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:33,278
It'll take some time,
but we'll get started right away,

44
00:02:33,361 --> 00:02:35,864
and then they'll never be able to do
anything like this again.

45
00:02:35,947 --> 00:02:38,533
That's great! Isn't it great, Kipo?

46
00:02:38,616 --> 00:02:40,952
But how many will they cure while we wait?

47
00:02:41,035 --> 00:02:42,579
They're gonna keep attacking.

48
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:44,622
I have to fight back.

49
00:02:47,292 --> 00:02:49,419

-Kipo!
-We can't let her do this.

52
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,092
If she does, it'll ruin her!

53
00:02:56,175 --> 00:02:58,011
We'll stop her. You finish the vaccine.

54
00:02:58,094 --> 00:03:00,138
We need it now more than ever.

55
00:03:00,221 --> 00:03:03,850
-Okay. Just bring our girl back.
-We will.

56
00:03:03,933 --> 00:03:06,060
How exactly are we gonna stop a Mega Kipo?

57
00:03:06,769 --> 00:03:08,062

-Hm, you don't wanna do this.
-I don't.

68
00:03:39,677 --> 00:03:43,473
But Emilia's cure, her army,
everything is on that boat.

69
00:03:43,556 --> 00:03:45,183
They're not giving me any other choice.

70
00:03:45,266 --> 00:03:48,937
Before you do that, uh, uh,
Dave needs to tell you something.

71
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:51,105
I do?

72
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:55,318
Oh, yep, I do! [chuckles]

73
00:03:55,401 --> 00:03:57,987
You know this isn't the first war
between humans and mutes.

74
00:03:58,071 --> 00:04:01,032
I've got a story
that will give you a full 360

on this whole sink-the-ship business.

76
00:04:03,493 --> 00:04:06,037
360?
So I'll be exactly where I am right now?

Probably!
I don't know circle math! Whatever!

Uh, that humans
have always been selfish and mean,

is with a Mega Mute.

just a way to buy us some time.

Well, it started that way,
but I actually might have a point.

Just follow me.

-What did you say?
-Uh, nothing.

00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:20,565
I just meant I talked to some of them--

that they kept you in!

Come on, Kipo,
we're gonna be late for school!

There's nothing here.
What are you talking about?

Okay, class, today we're learning
about math, which has numbers in it.

And... Ring! Ring!

00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:56,100
School's done. Here's some diplomas.

152
00:07:56,184 --> 00:07:59,020
Wow! All that learning made me hungry.

00:07:59,103 --> 00:08:01,564
Let's go to Mrs. Graham's bakery.
Oh, look, we're here.

154

Guys, we don't have time for--

155
00:08:03,107 --> 00:08:06,861
Everyone has time for their favorite cake.

and chocolate chunks.

00:08:11,949 --> 00:08:14,785
-Ho-ho-ho-ho!
-All right, all right, stop.

158
00:08:15,244 --> 00:08:18,122
[Wolf] But you've been gushing about
your people since the day we met.

159
00:08:18,206 --> 00:08:20,124
We're just trying to remind you
that you love them.

160
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:22,710
But they're not my people anymore.

161
00:08:22,793 --> 00:08:26,839
They're an army,
an army that's erasing my friends.

162
00:08:26,923 --> 00:08:28,716
But you're still Kipo!

163
00:08:28,799 --> 00:08:31,385
The surface was a war zone
before you got here,

164
00:08:31,469 --> 00:08:34,889
and you've almost brought that to an end
because you always see the best in people.

165
00:08:34,972 --> 00:08:36,974
If you do this, you're gonna lose that.

166
00:08:37,058 --> 00:08:39,852
-We're all gonna lose that.
-We'll lose a lot more if I don't.

167
00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:42,647
Anyway, could you please let me
finish my story?

168
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:44,899
[Benson] Forget it, Dave.
Plan didn't work.

169
00:08:44,982 --> 00:08:47,693
Maybe yours didn't,
but I'm onto something!

170
00:08:47,777 --> 00:08:50,905
And by the end, you're gonna be all like,
"Dave, you're a genius.

You did it again!"

172
00:08:55,117 --> 00:08:56,118
-[yells]
-Okay.

173
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:57,328
So, there I was...

174
00:08:57,411 --> 00:08:59,747
-[sighs] Make it quick.
-Where was I?

175
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:01,707
<i>Super-hot, Daves rule, Mega Beavers...</i>

176
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:02,792
Oh, yeah!

177
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:08,339
<i>It had been 40 years since I found my fan,</i>
<i>and I was basically a hero to the Daves.</i>

178
00:09:08,422 --> 00:09:10,341
You're the best, Dave!

179
00:09:10,424 --> 00:09:12,802
Thank you, David! That means a lot.

180
00:09:13,928 --> 00:09:17,139
-Can you believe that guy?
-[man] Now!

181
00:09:17,848 --> 00:09:19,058
[yelling] Robots!

182
00:09:19,141 --> 00:09:20,768
I knew this day would come!

183
00:09:20,851 --> 00:09:22,103
I'll protect you, my Daves.

184
00:09:22,186 --> 00:09:23,688
Get out of here, robots! Shoo!

185
00:09:23,771 --> 00:09:25,898
Shh, shh! [growling]

186
00:09:27,191 --> 00:09:29,527
We demand... the fan!

187
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:32,238
Never! This fan belongs to the Daves,

188
00:09:32,321 --> 00:09:35,366
so get your cold,
rusty fingers away from me.

189
00:09:35,866 --> 00:09:39,245
[all gasp]
You're no robot, you're that dweeb.

190
00:09:39,328 --> 00:09:42,331
Nay, I am the grandson of that dweeb.

191
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:46,252
You stole the great fan
our people were promised, bug man.

192
00:09:46,335 --> 00:09:51,299
And now, generations later,
we have come for our breezy revenge.

193
00:09:51,382 --> 00:09:53,884
Fanatics, attack!

194
00:09:53,968 --> 00:09:55,886
[all yelling]

195
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:59,056

[squealing]

197
00:10:08,899 --> 00:10:10,943
[Dave]<i> Of course, I fought bravely.</i>

198
00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:12,820
[yelling] Run away, run away!

199
00:10:13,154 --> 00:10:16,115
[panting] I'll never let them have you.

200
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:20,578
[music continues]

201
00:10:21,162 --> 00:10:22,622

[laughs]

203
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:29,712
And that's how I lost my fan.

204
00:10:29,795 --> 00:10:31,339
So, the lesson is...?

205
00:10:31,422 --> 00:10:33,090
The first time. I'm not done yet.

206
00:10:33,174 --> 00:10:35,343
<i>Thus the Great Dave Wars began.</i>

207
00:10:35,426 --> 00:10:38,596
<i>Naturally, I became</i>
<i>the commander of the Dave Army.</i>

208
00:10:43,893 --> 00:10:46,228
[groans]

209
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:54,028
For fan! Move, move, move!

210
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:58,616
<i>Every single day, it was the same fight.</i>

211
00:10:58,699 --> 00:11:01,494
<i>We'd win the fan,</i>
<i>then they would win the fan,</i>

212
00:11:01,577 --> 00:11:05,539
<i>over and over for 200 years.</i>

213
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,587
<i>And you're probably thinking,</i>
<i>"No big deal. Daves are immortal."</i>

214
00:11:15,383 --> 00:11:17,885
<i>But the fanatics figured out</i>
<i>our one weakness.</i>

215
00:11:19,011 --> 00:11:20,137
[gasping]

216
00:11:22,431 --> 00:11:23,432
[yelps]

217
00:11:24,975 --> 00:11:28,270
<i>And over time,</i>
<i>there were fewer and fewer Daves.</i>

218
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:31,732
<i>Until I, Dave, was the only Dave left.</i>

219
00:11:31,816 --> 00:11:34,527
You can die? How?

220
00:11:35,236 --> 00:11:37,405
Oh, it's so dumb. All you have to do is...

221
00:11:37,488 --> 00:11:39,532
Wait a minute! No way!

222
00:11:39,615 --> 00:11:41,742
I am not falling for that again!

223
00:11:41,826 --> 00:11:44,912
So, humans are the reason
you're the only Dave.

224
00:11:44,995 --> 00:11:47,706
I think you all are focusing on
the wrong parts of the story,

225
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:52,169
which makes sense because I haven't
gotten to the part you should focus on.

226
00:11:52,253 --> 00:11:54,713
-You see--
-Thanks, but I've heard enough, Dave,

227
00:11:54,797 --> 00:11:57,842
and I've never been
more sure of what I need to do.

228
00:11:57,925 --> 00:11:59,051
If I don't fight back now,

229
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:01,595
every mute on the surface
will end up like your friends,

230
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:03,139
and I won't let that happen.

231
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:06,642
Wait, Kipo, you really do need to listen
to the rest of Dave's story.

232
00:12:06,725 --> 00:12:08,394
I finally know where he's going with it.

233
00:12:08,477 --> 00:12:09,687
It's the story of--

234
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:13,149

No one skips out on Dave's story time!

[growls]

240
00:12:52,938 --> 00:12:54,899
You need to get to her
before she reaches the boat!

241
00:12:54,982 --> 00:12:57,610
-Uh, yeah, I know that, dude.
-Hurry, Dave!

242
00:12:57,693 --> 00:12:58,777
[squeals]

243
00:13:03,032 --> 00:13:05,826
She's coming for us! Run!

[crowd screaming]

245
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:09,663
Dad, why is everyone afraid of Kipo?

246
00:13:09,747 --> 00:13:11,707
[gasps] You did it, didn't you?

247
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:13,167
You hurt Kipo's friends.

248
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:17,755
I was doing what I had to, for you,
Doag, to make the surface safe.

249
00:13:17,838 --> 00:13:20,966
You didn't do this for Doag,
you did it for Hoag!

Get us out of here!

253
00:13:32,102 --> 00:13:34,146
I know you're angry,
but please just listen.

254
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:37,858
Yeah, you're gonna love
the epic ending to my thrilling tale.

255

[overlapping shouting]

256
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:44,532
As I was saying,
although I was the last of the Dave army,

257
00:13:44,615 --> 00:13:47,076
the fan was safe in my powerful arms...

258
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:50,496
<i>until the day I met my greatest nemesis.</i>

-[straining]
-In your face, little kid!

266
00:14:16,146 --> 00:14:18,482
Good thing I installed
that security rock right there.

267
00:14:18,566 --> 00:14:22,486
[chuckles] I can't believe
they thought a kid could beat me!

268
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:26,740
Tell your people to give up now
'cause no one defeats Dave!

269

270
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:29,368
Oh, no.

Oh, raspberries.

Excuse me? I'm the fiercest warrior

Yeah, right.
You can't even chew through that rope.

Well, I will because I have to

There's never any snacks.

Don't say "snacks." I'm starving.

Well, not that it's a competition,

You know, I could hang up here for years,

we untie each other at the same time,

00:18:58,178 --> 00:19:00,806
But it could use a little something extra.

347
00:19:05,018 --> 00:19:07,271
Now try this.

348
00:19:14,528 --> 00:19:15,571
[spitting]

349
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:18,282
Oh, no, that's horrible!

350
00:19:18,365 --> 00:19:19,741
Why did I eat that?

351
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:21,952
There was no way that was gonna be good.

352
00:19:22,035 --> 00:19:24,288
Yeah, I don't know anything about cooking.

353
00:19:24,788 --> 00:19:26,582
I'm way better at eating.

354
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:30,919
[giggling] Great. You eat, I'll cook.

355
00:19:31,795 --> 00:19:33,964
You got a deal, little man.

356
00:19:39,386 --> 00:19:41,054
Mmm. Mmm!

357
00:19:43,098 --> 00:19:45,934
[Dave]<i> We were stuck in</i>
<i>an endless cycle to get that fan.</i>

358
00:19:46,101 --> 00:19:49,897
If we hadn't slowed down and decided
not to fight for just a second--

359
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:51,982
I wouldn't have my best friend, Benson.

360
00:19:52,065 --> 00:19:54,526
And I wouldn't have my best friend, Dave.

361
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:56,737
[sniffles] You guys are so weird.

362
00:19:56,820 --> 00:20:00,365
That's what I'm trying to say:
Don't let this be your Fan, Kipo.

363
00:20:00,741 --> 00:20:02,284
[growling]

364
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:10,000
[roaring]

365
00:20:10,626 --> 00:20:12,252
Welp, I did my best.

366
00:20:15,923 --> 00:20:17,466
[people speaking indistinctly]

367
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:19,218
Why is Kipo doing this?

368
00:20:19,301 --> 00:20:21,178
She doesn't want us on the surface.

369
00:20:21,261 --> 00:20:22,804
She wants to get rid of us!

370
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:23,889
That's not true.

371
00:20:23,972 --> 00:20:25,515
She's got this whole HMUFA thing

372
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:27,643
where she wants
humans and mutes to be friends.

373
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:29,478
If you like her so much...

374
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:30,395
[grunts]

375
00:20:31,396 --> 00:20:33,148
why don't you wait for her?

376
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:34,858
-[crash]
-[both gasp]

377
00:20:36,818 --> 00:20:38,987
[crowd screaming]

378
00:20:40,989 --> 00:20:42,407
[roars]

379
00:20:42,658 --> 00:20:43,784
[indistinct chatter]

380
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,127
[grunts]

381
00:20:57,256 --> 00:21:00,384
You came to my home and hurt my friends,

382
00:21:00,467 --> 00:21:02,594
so I came here to do the same to you.

383
00:21:02,678 --> 00:21:03,720
[all gasp]

384
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:09,393
But this fighting between humans and mutes
has been happening for centuries.

385
00:21:09,476 --> 00:21:11,603
And I could win today's battle,

386
00:21:11,687 --> 00:21:14,856
but some other humans
would come along to continue the war.

387
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:18,944
That's because you can't
end a war by fighting it.

388
00:21:19,027 --> 00:21:21,238
My friends helped me see that.

389
00:21:21,321 --> 00:21:24,449
Dave, you genius. You did it again.

390
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:27,411
So I'm asking you, my people,

391
00:21:27,494 --> 00:21:30,831
Mr. Filburn, Mrs. Graham, my friends,

392
00:21:30,914 --> 00:21:34,376
to choose to stop fighting
and break the cycle.

393
00:21:34,459 --> 00:21:38,588
Which is why I, Kipo Oak,
am inviting you...

394
00:21:39,339 --> 00:21:40,841
to Prahm.

395
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:44,344
[music playing]
