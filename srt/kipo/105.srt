Come on!
We've been walking for forever.

I know you said it was a surprise.
But what if I guessed?

35
00:02:46,457 --> 00:02:49,627
I've got it! You're taking us
to a mystical blind woman

00:02:49,711 --> 00:02:51,880
who lives in the trunk
of a spooky old tree

37
00:02:51,963 --> 00:02:56,593
and doesn't need eyes
because what she can see is the future.

OK, first of all, it's been an hour.
And second, what?!

She's not gonna stop.
Just tell us.

Look, if there's one thing I've learned
in all my time on the surface,

41
00:03:05,268 --> 00:03:08,605
it's that you gotta enjoy the journey,
not just the destination.

42
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:10,398
So, everyone shut up
and enjoy the journey!

Who knows?

49

If he's using mind control on a Mega Mute,
I guess he could try to use it on them.

50
00:03:27,957 --> 00:03:30,126
I've heard that he is a Mega Mute,

51
00:03:30,209 --> 00:03:33,421
and he uses his mind control
to make people walk right into his mouth.

What?!
I don't want my dad to walk into a mouth!

Do you even have a plan?

70
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:26,057
Because this clearly
isn't helping anybody.

71
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:29,060
Fine. You don't trust me?
The old observatory.

72
00:04:29,143 --> 00:04:31,562
It's got a giant telescope
that can see the whole city.

we'll spot 'em.

[nervous chuckle] Well, technically,

77
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,949
the observatory
is Newton Wolves territory.

-Which is bad?
-Nah.

and talk about math all day.

-They're a bunch of dweebs.
-[Wolf] They're dangerous!

If we wanna survive this,

91
00:05:20,028 --> 00:05:22,363
we need to think like a pack
and act like a pack.

00:05:22,447 --> 00:05:24,824
-We need to be a pack.
-Got it.

Guys, I found a single apple.

104

-Uh-- Uh-- What?!
-[Kipo grunts]

105
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:02,153
And, finally, pack rule number four:
Follow your alpha.

106
00:06:02,236 --> 00:06:04,405
An alpha leads and speaks for the pack.

107
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:06,824
The Newton Wolves
will only address our alpha.

108
00:06:06,908 --> 00:06:08,284
That's just how wolves work.

109
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:11,370
And... our alpha is you?

110
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:13,206
No, Kipo. It's you.

111
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:16,793
Why isn't it me?
I'm the oldest and best-looking.

112
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:18,252
I'm a born leader.

113
00:06:18,336 --> 00:06:20,088
No offense, Dave, but you're a pea-brain.

114
00:06:20,171 --> 00:06:24,175
These wolves are nerds.
And Kipo is, well, a really big nerd.

115
00:06:24,258 --> 00:06:27,178
-Aw, thanks.
-Uh, offense taken.

116
00:06:27,261 --> 00:06:29,138
We need to be worth more than food.

117
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:31,766
These wolves need to believe
we have knowledge to offer.

118
00:06:31,849 --> 00:06:34,143
Kipo knows all about stars and galleries--

119
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:35,561
-Galaxies.
-Ha! Nerd.

120
00:06:35,645 --> 00:06:37,939
She'll keep them talking.
They'll let us stay for the night,

121
00:06:38,022 --> 00:06:40,441
and we'll sneak off to the telescope
once they fall asleep.

122
00:06:40,525 --> 00:06:42,276
Can't we just ask?

123
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,945
This sounds like it involves
a lot of waiting,

124
00:06:44,028 --> 00:06:45,863
and my people could be miles away by then.

125
00:06:45,947 --> 00:06:47,073
Or inside a mute's mouth.

126
00:06:47,824 --> 00:06:51,410
You think they'll be your friends,
but wolves aren't like other mutes.

127
00:06:51,494 --> 00:06:53,287
-Get it?
-Aren't you forgetting something?

128
00:06:53,371 --> 00:06:55,706
Like your choice of wardrobe, maybe?

129
00:06:56,207 --> 00:06:58,042
No. No way.

130
00:06:58,126 --> 00:06:59,043
He's got a point.

131
00:06:59,127 --> 00:07:01,546
The poisonous staff
and, uh, the dead wolf on your back

132
00:07:01,629 --> 00:07:03,506
might send the wrong message. Heh.

133
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:04,674
Then I won't go.

134
00:07:05,716 --> 00:07:07,802
You have a pack.
You have us.

135
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:16,811
[Benson] So hungry.

136
00:07:16,894 --> 00:07:18,688
[Kipo] We shouldn't call you Wolf
in front of them,

137
00:07:18,771 --> 00:07:21,524
so maybe you could tell us
your real name.

138
00:07:21,607 --> 00:07:24,026
Um, yeah.
It's Bone Ripper.

139
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:28,197
Ah, that's a bunch of--
That's actually the coolest name ever.

140
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:29,282
Come on.

141
00:07:29,365 --> 00:07:31,951
If we're going to be a real pack,
you gotta tell us the truth.

142
00:07:32,034 --> 00:07:34,162
[sighs] Why don't you just
pick one for me?

143
00:07:34,245 --> 00:07:36,747
Fine.
We'll call you Jolene.

144
00:07:37,582 --> 00:07:39,459
Argh. Never mind.

145
00:07:39,542 --> 00:07:41,043
Too late, Jolene.

146
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:43,087
Ha ha ha! Great name.

[grunting]

148
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:48,009
Almost there, pack!
Let's do this.

149
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:54,015
Guys? Pack formation.

Humans, in our territory.

157
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:24,754
Hmm.
I think they're a pack.

158
00:08:24,837 --> 00:08:26,339
[whimpering]

159
00:08:26,422 --> 00:08:29,634
I mean, a very weird pack.
But a pack.

160
00:08:29,717 --> 00:08:33,554
They're trespassers.
And what do we do with trespassers?

161
00:08:33,638 --> 00:08:36,766
[all howling]

162
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:38,059
Brother, brother, brother.

163
00:08:38,142 --> 00:08:41,020
Don't be shackled by your instincts.

164
00:08:41,103 --> 00:08:43,731
Remember, we're evolved.

165
00:08:43,814 --> 00:08:45,942
Let knowledge be our prey.

166
00:08:46,567 --> 00:08:49,695
-Let knowledge be our prey!
-[coughs] Nerds.

167
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:51,906
Do you speak for your pack, bug?

168
00:08:51,989 --> 00:08:54,492
-Oh, actually--
-Yep. I'm the alpha of this pack.

169
00:08:54,575 --> 00:08:56,953
And my name is Bone Ripper.

170
00:08:57,787 --> 00:09:01,958
I see. And what exactly
is your pack doing on our turf?

171
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:04,794
We're astronomers.
We've come to share our knowledge.

172
00:09:04,877 --> 00:09:07,296
Oh.
We're the most learned scholars on earth.

173
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:09,924
What could you possibly share
that we don't already know?

174
00:09:10,007 --> 00:09:13,511
There are one-thousand trillion billion
stars in the night sky.

175
00:09:13,594 --> 00:09:15,972
Huh. Kid stuff.
Everyone knows that.

176
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:18,140
Which is ten times more
than grains of sand

177
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:20,476
in all the world's
deserts and beaches.

178
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:24,564
But there are even more ways
to shuffle a simple deck of cards.

179
00:09:24,647 --> 00:09:26,190
How many, you ask?

180
00:09:26,274 --> 00:09:29,068
Eighty unvigintillion combinations.

181
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:32,446
-That's eight with 67 zeros.
-[all] Whoa!

182
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:35,449
I thought the bug was the alpha.

183
00:09:35,533 --> 00:09:38,244
-[wolves growling]
-Who, Kipo? She's my student.

184
00:09:38,327 --> 00:09:42,081
Taught her everything she knows--
about science and math and all that junk.

185
00:09:42,164 --> 00:09:44,041
Dave, come on. I'm supposed to--

186
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:45,376
Bad Kipo! Bad!

187
00:09:45,459 --> 00:09:48,004
You know you're not
supposed to speak unless spoken to.

188
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:50,256
-Alpha-ing. Am I right?
-[both] Mm-hmm.

189
00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:53,050
This is Jolene.
Don't expect her to say much.

190
00:09:53,134 --> 00:09:54,760
She's a real pea-brain.

191
00:09:54,844 --> 00:09:57,680
Of course, thanks
to his diminutive size,

192
00:09:57,763 --> 00:10:00,808
our alpha's brain
is also the size of a pea.

193
00:10:01,517 --> 00:10:03,769
It's true. It's very small.
I've seen it.

194
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:05,646
And this is Benson,

195
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:08,941
my robot that I built,
because I'm a genius.

196
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:10,401
A robot? [sniffs]

197
00:10:10,484 --> 00:10:13,279
Smells quite human to me.
[growls]

198
00:10:13,362 --> 00:10:15,197
[robotic voice]
Activating demo protocol.

199
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:18,034
[beatboxing]

200
00:10:18,117 --> 00:10:19,660
Hmm. Impressive.

201
00:10:19,744 --> 00:10:21,078
And what about her?

202
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:23,873
[squeals]

203
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:27,293
Mandu?
Oh, she's our glorious alpha's wife.

204
00:10:27,376 --> 00:10:28,961
Praise Bone Ripper.

205
00:10:29,045 --> 00:10:31,047
[wolves growling]

206
00:10:33,257 --> 00:10:34,383
[kissing sounds]

207
00:10:35,343 --> 00:10:37,094
[laughing]

208
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:41,015
[wolf 2]
Well, uh, alpha bug.

209
00:10:41,098 --> 00:10:44,852
If your pack has been drawn together
by a passion for science,

210
00:10:44,935 --> 00:10:46,646
you will find friends here.

211
00:10:46,729 --> 00:10:50,566
-I am Billions.
-And I am Billions.

212
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:53,027
-Billions...
-And Billions.

213
00:10:55,196 --> 00:11:00,159
Join us. We can exchange
knowledge of the cosmos over dinner.

214
00:11:00,242 --> 00:11:04,205
Yes, I'm quite eager to see
what else you have to offer.

215
00:11:04,747 --> 00:11:06,290
-[clank]
-[all gasp]

216
00:11:06,374 --> 00:11:07,750
Hi, Orion.

217
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:10,586
Lil' Dip!
What's happenin', Big Dipper?

218
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:13,214
Hey, look, there's my sign!
Aries!

219
00:11:13,297 --> 00:11:16,217
Remember when we saw the real Aries
the first night we met?

220
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:18,969
So, in that way, it's kind of our sign.

221
00:11:19,053 --> 00:11:21,722
[Billions] Newton Wolves!
Time for dinner!

222
00:11:24,392 --> 00:11:26,268
Your pack may be seated.

223
00:11:26,394 --> 00:11:29,480
-Move!
-[all talking]

224
00:11:29,563 --> 00:11:32,566
Not till your alpha figures out
which one of these is the cushiest.

225
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:34,610
-Shouldn't you sit with your "wife"?
-Unhh!

226
00:11:34,693 --> 00:11:36,028
Don't make me turn you off!

227
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:37,655
[Benson]
My bad!

228
00:11:37,738 --> 00:11:38,948
My chair! Come on. Get away!

229
00:11:40,783 --> 00:11:43,077
Hey, it's all right.
The plan's working.

230
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,495
They really like us.

231
00:11:45,663 --> 00:11:48,249
Ooh, yes! Beep-boop.
I'm starving.

232
00:11:48,332 --> 00:11:51,127
For our guests, our finest fillets.

233
00:11:51,752 --> 00:11:54,088
And for the robot, soup du oil.

234
00:11:54,797 --> 00:11:57,299
Apologies if this isn't optimal
for your hardware.

235
00:11:57,383 --> 00:11:59,677
We still have much to learn
about robotics.

236
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,053
[whimpers] Beep-boop.

237
00:12:05,933 --> 00:12:07,643
[clanking]

238
00:12:07,726 --> 00:12:12,148
Tonight, we are joined by a pack
that shares our love of the cosmos.

239
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:15,609
And if they can illuminate us
with some knowledge of their own,

240
00:12:15,734 --> 00:12:20,114
perhaps they'll be invited
to our dessert hunt at moonrise.

241
00:12:20,197 --> 00:12:22,241
[all howling]

242
00:12:23,325 --> 00:12:25,995
Yeah, and if they can't,
maybe they'll be our dessert hunt.

243
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:27,037
[laughing]

244
00:12:27,705 --> 00:12:30,207
Hey, Jolene. We got this.
Easy peasy.

245
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:34,295
My dad's probably starving, right now.
I hope this is a short meal.

246
00:12:34,378 --> 00:12:37,798
And now, please enjoy our nightly ritual.

247
00:12:37,882 --> 00:12:39,884
A brief presentation on absolutely
everything we've learned

248
00:12:39,967 --> 00:12:41,010
about the known universe.

249
00:12:43,345 --> 00:12:45,681
<i>âª All life started, with the Big Bang âª</i>

250
00:12:45,764 --> 00:12:48,642
<i>âª An explosion so great</i>
<i>From which we all sprang âª</i>

251
00:12:49,185 --> 00:12:51,020
<i>âª The universe dispersed mass âª</i>

252
00:12:51,103 --> 00:12:52,605
<i>âª Traversing space, time passed âª</i>

253
00:12:52,688 --> 00:12:54,482
<i>âª Space expanding mad fast âª</i>

254
00:12:54,565 --> 00:12:56,484
<i>âª Stars made of light and gas âª</i>

255
00:12:56,567 --> 00:12:59,278
<i>âª Cosmos with billions of stars</i>
<i>Gleaming âª</i>

256
00:12:59,361 --> 00:13:02,031
<i>âª These are the events</i>
<i>That brought us wolves into being âª</i>

257
00:13:02,114 --> 00:13:04,116
New-ton! New-ton!

258
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,659
-[song continues]
-A "big bang"?

259
00:13:05,743 --> 00:13:08,412
These dorks have no idea
what they're talking about.

260
00:13:08,496 --> 00:13:11,499
Ooh, let's sneak off and see
the telescope while they're distracted.

261
00:13:11,582 --> 00:13:14,502
No, we stick to the plan.
We wait until they're asleep.

262
00:13:14,585 --> 00:13:17,379
My dad might not have another night.
This is our chance.

263
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:19,131
<i>âª Now it's time to break it down âª</i>

264
00:13:19,215 --> 00:13:22,885
<i>âª With every kind of star</i>
<i>That has ever been classified! âª</i>

265
00:13:22,968 --> 00:13:25,262
<i>âª We're talking giants, subgiants,</i>
<i>Red giants âª</i>

266
00:13:25,346 --> 00:13:26,931
<i>âª Blue giants,</i>
<i>Luminous giants âª</i>

<i>âª Very luminous supergiants âª</i>

268

<i>âª And less luminous supergiants âª</i>

00:13:31,393 --> 00:13:32,645
<i>âª Neutron star âª</i>

Just gonna
abandon the pack, huh?

272
00:13:34,855 --> 00:13:37,900
-What? That's not... I--
-Just messin' with you.

273
00:13:37,983 --> 00:13:39,860
Alpha says do whatever you want.

274
00:13:39,944 --> 00:13:42,530
<i>-âª Mos def âª</i>
<i>-âª You know what? âª</i>

278
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:54,458
[electrical buzzing]

279
00:13:54,542 --> 00:13:56,293
Oh, my gosh!
Is that a Tesla coil?!

280
00:13:56,377 --> 00:13:57,336
[gasps]

281
00:13:57,419 --> 00:13:59,004
No. Focus, Kipo.

282
00:13:59,088 --> 00:14:00,214
You're on a mission.

283
00:14:01,882 --> 00:14:03,050
[hinges creak]

284
00:14:03,133 --> 00:14:04,677
[female voice] Still no sign
of the burrow humans.

285
00:14:04,843 --> 00:14:06,929
Scarlemagne won't be pleased.

286
00:14:07,012 --> 00:14:08,722
[male wolf] Why don't we just give him
the humans we found today?

287
00:14:08,806 --> 00:14:11,892
-[gasps]
-Hold him over until we find the others.

288
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:13,060
[female wolf] Weren't you listening?

289
00:14:13,143 --> 00:14:14,687
-They're astronomers.
-[Flamingo squawks]

290
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:16,981
Billions and Billions
want to compare notes with them.

291
00:14:17,064 --> 00:14:19,567
[male wolf]
Ohh. Just send the report, Megan.

292
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:20,734
[Megan] Ya know what,

293
00:14:20,859 --> 00:14:22,945
sometimes I feel like
you have no respect for our alphas.

294
00:14:25,781 --> 00:14:27,616
I hope we didn't miss the rap.

295
00:14:30,661 --> 00:14:33,998
The Newton Wolves work for Scarlemagne?

296
00:14:34,081 --> 00:14:36,876
-[weak laughter]
-[Kipo gasps]

297
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:38,294
Wait, where's Kipo?

298
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:40,713
What? No! No!
Where is she?

299
00:14:40,796 --> 00:14:42,506
I told her she could go check out
the telescope real quick.

300
00:14:42,673 --> 00:14:44,383
-Are you crazy?
-Ow!

301
00:14:44,466 --> 00:14:46,218
Chill out!
It's not a problem.

302
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:49,013
<i>âª And that's everything we learned</i>
<i>About the known universe âª</i>

303
00:14:49,096 --> 00:14:50,139
[all] The end!

304
00:14:50,222 --> 00:14:53,225
And now, let's hear from our peers.
Your turn.

305
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:55,060
OK, that's a problem.

306
00:14:55,144 --> 00:14:57,146
-[chuckling continues]
-Jamack?

307
00:14:57,229 --> 00:15:02,234
Of course.
Another cruel joke from the universe.

308
00:15:02,318 --> 00:15:04,528
-What happened to you?
-[chuckling]

309
00:15:04,612 --> 00:15:07,239
What happened to me?
You happened to me!

310
00:15:07,323 --> 00:15:11,911
I fought and scratched and hopped
for everything I had in this world,

311
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:14,663
and in one fell swoop,
you just took it all away!

312
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:18,584
And now, just before I become dessert
for a bunch of wolves,

313
00:15:18,667 --> 00:15:20,753
you show up to rub it in my face.

314
00:15:20,836 --> 00:15:23,088
-Dessert?
-Uh, yeah.

315
00:15:23,172 --> 00:15:25,466
I'm not here to clean the telescope.

316
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:30,596
You know, my one solace
is knowing your people are going down.

317
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:33,098
You see, you're new around here.

318
00:15:33,182 --> 00:15:35,434
For years, it was chaos--

319
00:15:35,517 --> 00:15:37,645
herd versus pack versus flock--

320
00:15:37,728 --> 00:15:41,690
until Scarlemagne showed us
what we have in common: fear.

321
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:45,444
He feeds on that fear--
and everyone's falling in line.

322
00:15:45,527 --> 00:15:49,198
He's the new game in town,
and he wants your people.

323
00:15:50,115 --> 00:15:52,034
I'm not afraid of Scarlemagne.

324
00:15:52,117 --> 00:15:55,913
Me and my friends are a pack.
We'll find my people before he does.

325
00:15:55,996 --> 00:15:57,873
[laughing] Oh, yippee!

326
00:15:57,957 --> 00:15:59,375
I'm sorry, I didn't realize

327
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:01,835
you had the power of friendship
on your side!

328
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:04,004
[laughs] Your pack?

329
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:06,507
They'll abandon you
at your most vulnerable.

330
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:09,468
Just like my pack abandoned me.

331
00:16:10,052 --> 00:16:11,428
Wolf...

332
00:16:18,686 --> 00:16:20,187
[grunts]

333
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:22,147
W-Why would you do that?

334
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:24,858
It's my turn to do some soul-searching.

335
00:16:24,942 --> 00:16:26,777
Well, don't think this makes us even.

336
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:28,779
See you around, Burrow Girl.

[grunting, panting]

342
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:41,667
Almost there.

343
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:43,585
[grunting]

344
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:44,795
Ohhh!

345
00:16:45,796 --> 00:16:47,548
-[scream]
-[thud]

346
00:16:52,928 --> 00:16:55,806
The Earth is flat!
That's just common sense.

347
00:16:57,433 --> 00:16:58,517
Oh, we are so dead.

348
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,811
If it's round,
why don't we fall off the bottom?

349
00:17:00,894 --> 00:17:03,897
-This guy gets it.
-[wolf] Hmm? Unh-unh-unh.

350
00:17:03,981 --> 00:17:05,816
-[wolves] Boo!
-[Dave] I mean, birds fly

351
00:17:05,899 --> 00:17:07,776
-in a straight line, right?
-[wolf] No! The Earth is round!

352
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:10,988
-[wolves razzing, howling]
-[Dave continues]

353
00:17:11,071 --> 00:17:14,199
I'm sorry I abandoned the pack...
and you.

354
00:17:15,492 --> 00:17:18,203
You were right about these wolves.
They're not our friends.

355
00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:19,913
They work for Scarlemagne and--

356
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:21,874
Dessert has escaped!

357
00:17:21,957 --> 00:17:24,126
-What did you do?
-It was Jamack.

358
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:25,753
-He was chained and--
-You let him go?!

359
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:30,674
[wolves growling]

360
00:17:30,758 --> 00:17:33,052
Oh, we'll have dessert.

361
00:17:33,135 --> 00:17:36,930
But if not frog, then what will we hunt?

362
00:17:37,598 --> 00:17:38,807
[clank]

363
00:17:39,641 --> 00:17:41,810
[growling continues]

364
00:17:45,147 --> 00:17:46,607
[Wolf] Not them.

365
00:17:50,235 --> 00:17:53,155
They're slow, they're stupid...

366
00:17:54,198 --> 00:17:55,240
and they're not a pack.

367
00:17:56,742 --> 00:17:58,702
If you want a real hunt...

368
00:17:58,786 --> 00:17:59,828
hunt me.

369
00:18:00,704 --> 00:18:02,915
[hip-hop song playing]

370
00:18:02,998 --> 00:18:04,875

[howling]

374
00:18:15,135 --> 00:18:17,805
-We'll never catch up in time.
-We have to try!

375
00:18:17,888 --> 00:18:20,849
She's a part of our pack,
whether she wants us or not!

376
00:18:36,031 --> 00:18:37,699
-Come on!
-Where are they?

377
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:40,369
-It's getting dark.
-I... I don't know.

378
00:18:40,994 --> 00:18:42,162
Oh, no.

379
00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:54,216
She's trapped.
What do we do?

380
00:18:57,928 --> 00:18:59,471
Is that...skin?

381
00:18:59,555 --> 00:19:01,265
Ohh. Gross.

382
00:19:04,059 --> 00:19:07,312
I. Hate. Wolves.

383
00:19:07,396 --> 00:19:10,232

[growling]

386
00:19:19,908 --> 00:19:21,243
She can't see them!

387
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:28,792
What?

388
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:31,879
Behind you!

389
00:19:33,964 --> 00:19:35,340
[crying out]

390
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:38,677
Why are you here?

391
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,179
I ran away so you could escape.

392
00:19:40,262 --> 00:19:42,055
Pack rule number one:
Move together.

393
00:19:43,348 --> 00:19:45,475
[whimpers] Can anyone see them?

394
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:47,436
[Mandu squealing]

395

[grunting]

396
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:50,022
Wait!
Where are you going?

397
00:19:50,772 --> 00:19:51,773
[Kipo] Duck!

398
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:54,484
Right!

399
00:19:54,568 --> 00:19:55,694
Left!

401

[squeals twice]

404
00:20:07,915 --> 00:20:08,874
Yeah!

405
00:20:12,461 --> 00:20:14,004
Benson! How's that blood sugar?

406
00:20:14,087 --> 00:20:17,466
Because there's a wolf coming
straight at you, waving two juicy apples!

407
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:19,718
Yaaahhh!

408
00:20:20,177 --> 00:20:21,762
Yaaaahh!

409
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:24,181
Yaaahhh!

410
00:20:27,517 --> 00:20:30,312
-Yaahhh!
-[wolves whimpering]

411
00:20:32,856 --> 00:20:34,566
[panting]

412
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:35,692
We beat them!

413
00:20:35,776 --> 00:20:37,361
[squeals]

414
00:20:37,444 --> 00:20:38,612

417
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:48,664
Hey, it's all right.
We're OK now.

418
00:20:48,747 --> 00:20:49,915
We're a pack!

419
00:20:51,959 --> 00:20:55,420
More like a group of people
who are pretty good at not dying together.

420
00:20:56,672 --> 00:20:57,589
[Benson spits]

421
00:20:57,673 --> 00:20:59,967
Kipo, how did you see those wolves?

422
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:05,180
I lived underground for so long,
so I'm just used to the dark, I guess?

423
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:08,517
Guys, we should get to that telescope
before these hairy geeks wake up.

424
00:21:09,309 --> 00:21:12,104
It's a dead end.
They work for Scarlemagne.

425
00:21:12,187 --> 00:21:14,356
He's been using it
to search for my people.

426
00:21:14,439 --> 00:21:17,901
There's only one thing we can do.
We have to destroy it.

427
00:21:21,071 --> 00:21:23,532
[Mandu grunting]

428
00:21:24,449 --> 00:21:26,034
A little rare, but I'm into it.

[Kipo grunting]

430
00:21:31,873 --> 00:21:34,334
I'm sorry I didn't
trust you about the wolves.

431
00:21:34,418 --> 00:21:35,794
You were right.

432
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:39,756
You had another pack before us,
didn't you?

433
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:42,134
And they were wolves.

434
00:21:43,468 --> 00:21:45,053
You were raised by wolves.

435
00:21:47,097 --> 00:21:50,809
Yeah. And that's all you ever
need to know about it. Trust me.

436
00:21:50,892 --> 00:21:52,853
[exhales]
It's about to come down.

437
00:21:52,936 --> 00:21:54,688
You sure you don't wanna take
one last look?

438
00:21:54,771 --> 00:21:56,023
See if you can spot your people?

439
00:21:57,858 --> 00:22:00,777
There's no time.
I won't put my friends at risk.

440
00:22:00,861 --> 00:22:02,696
-Not again.
-Come on. One look.

441
00:22:02,779 --> 00:22:04,031
That's an order from your alpha.

442
00:22:13,957 --> 00:22:16,585
I don't see anything.
I'm sorry, Dad.

Ahh.

446
00:22:24,926 --> 00:22:26,636
-Whoa!
-[Kipo] Wait!

[crash]

448
00:22:34,311 --> 00:22:36,313
What was it?
What'd you see?

449
00:22:36,813 --> 00:22:37,773
A message!

450
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:40,776
A message from my dad.
