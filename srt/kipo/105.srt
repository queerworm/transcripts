-So, Benson, where are you taking us?
-Kipo...

Come on!
We've been walking for forever.

34
00:02:41,786 --> 00:02:45,790
I know you said it was a surprise.
But what if I guessed?

35
00:02:46,457 --> 00:02:49,627
I've got it! You're taking us
to a mystical blind woman

36
00:02:49,711 --> 00:02:51,880
who lives in the trunk
of a spooky old tree

37
00:02:51,963 --> 00:02:56,593
and doesn't need eyes
because what she can see is the future.

OK, first of all, it's been an hour.
And second, what?!

39

She's not gonna stop.
Just tell us.

40
00:03:01,764 --> 00:03:05,184
Look, if there's one thing I've learned
in all my time on the surface,

41
00:03:05,268 --> 00:03:08,605
it's that you gotta enjoy the journey,
not just the destination.

42
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:10,398
So, everyone shut up
and enjoy the journey!

Who knows?

49
00:03:23,745 --> 00:03:27,874
If he's using mind control on a Mega Mute,
I guess he could try to use it on them.

50
00:03:27,957 --> 00:03:30,126
I've heard that he is a Mega Mute,

51
00:03:30,209 --> 00:03:33,421
and he uses his mind control
to make people walk right into his mouth.

52

What?!
I don't want my dad to walk into a mouth!

-It isn't.

00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:23,513
Do you even have a plan?

70
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:26,057
Because this clearly
isn't helping anybody.

71
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:29,060
Fine. You don't trust me?
The old observatory.

72
00:04:29,143 --> 00:04:31,562
It's got a giant telescope
that can see the whole city.

73
00:04:31,646 --> 00:04:33,606

we'll spot 'em.

-What? Why?

Benson, why don't you tell her?

76
00:04:38,069 --> 00:04:40,196
[nervous chuckle] Well, technically,

77
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,949
the observatory
is Newton Wolves territory.

78
00:04:43,032 --> 00:04:45,660
-Which is bad?
-Nah.

79
00:04:45,743 --> 00:04:48,121

and talk about math all day.

-They're a bunch of dweebs.
-[Wolf] They're dangerous!

Wolves are predators.
Every one of them.

Yikes! Sounds like someone's still mad
at the wolf she's wearing.

the only way I find my people.

Please.

-If we do this, we need a plan.
-Yes! We're doing it!

00:05:10,601 --> 00:05:12,478
I mean, we're planning it.

00:05:12,562 --> 00:05:14,272
[gasps] Yeah!

[Wolf]
Wolves hunt isolated prey.

If we wanna survive this,

91
00:05:20,028 --> 00:05:22,363
we need to think like a pack
and act like a pack.

92
00:05:22,447 --> 00:05:24,824
-We need to be a pack.
-Got it.

-Yup.

No matter what, watch each other's backs.

00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:55,605
Guys, I found a single apple.

104
00:05:56,898 --> 00:05:58,816
-Uh-- Uh-- What?!
-[Kipo grunts]

105
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:02,153
And, finally, pack rule number four:
Follow your alpha.

106
00:06:02,236 --> 00:06:04,405
An alpha leads and speaks for the pack.

107
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:06,824
The Newton Wolves
will only address our alpha.

108
00:06:06,908 --> 00:06:08,284
That's just how wolves work.

109
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:11,370
And... our alpha is you?

110
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:13,206
No, Kipo. It's you.

111
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:16,793
Why isn't it me?
I'm the oldest and best-looking.

112
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:18,252
I'm a born leader.

113
00:06:18,336 --> 00:06:20,088
No offense, Dave, but you're a pea-brain.

114
00:06:20,171 --> 00:06:24,175
These wolves are nerds.
And Kipo is, well, a really big nerd.

115
00:06:24,258 --> 00:06:27,178
-Aw, thanks.
-Uh, offense taken.

116
00:06:27,261 --> 00:06:29,138
We need to be worth more than food.

117
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:31,766
These wolves need to believe
we have knowledge to offer.

118
00:06:31,849 --> 00:06:34,143
Kipo knows all about stars and galleries--

119
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:35,561
-Galaxies.
-Ha! Nerd.

120
00:06:35,645 --> 00:06:37,939
She'll keep them talking.
They'll let us stay for the night,

121
00:06:38,022 --> 00:06:40,441
and we'll sneak off to the telescope
once they fall asleep.

122
00:06:40,525 --> 00:06:42,276
Can't we just ask?

123
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,945
This sounds like it involves
a lot of waiting,

124
00:06:44,028 --> 00:06:45,863
and my people could be miles away by then.

125
00:06:45,947 --> 00:06:47,073
Or inside a mute's mouth.

126
00:06:47,824 --> 00:06:51,410
You think they'll be your friends,
but wolves aren't like other mutes.

127
00:06:51,494 --> 00:06:53,287
-Get it?
-Aren't you forgetting something?

128
00:06:53,371 --> 00:06:55,706
Like your choice of wardrobe, maybe?

129
00:06:56,207 --> 00:06:58,042
No. No way.

130
00:06:58,126 --> 00:06:59,043
He's got a point.

131
00:06:59,127 --> 00:07:01,546
The poisonous staff
and, uh, the dead wolf on your back

132
00:07:01,629 --> 00:07:03,506
might send the wrong message. Heh.

133
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:04,674
Then I won't go.

134
00:07:05,716 --> 00:07:07,802
You have a pack.
You have us.

135
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:16,811
[Benson] So hungry.

136
00:07:16,894 --> 00:07:18,688
[Kipo] We shouldn't call you Wolf
in front of them,

137
00:07:18,771 --> 00:07:21,524
so maybe you could tell us
your real name.

138
00:07:21,607 --> 00:07:24,026
Um, yeah.
It's Bone Ripper.

139
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:28,197
Ah, that's a bunch of--
That's actually the coolest name ever.

140
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:29,282
Come on.

141
00:07:29,365 --> 00:07:31,951
If we're going to be a real pack,
you gotta tell us the truth.

142
00:07:32,034 --> 00:07:34,162
[sighs] Why don't you just
pick one for me?

143
00:07:34,245 --> 00:07:36,747
Fine.
We'll call you Jolene.

144
00:07:37,582 --> 00:07:39,459
Argh. Never mind.

145
00:07:39,542 --> 00:07:41,043
Too late, Jolene.

146
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:43,087
Ha ha ha! Great name.

147
00:07:43,212 --> 00:07:45,214
[grunting]

148
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:48,009
Almost there, pack!
Let's do this.

149
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:54,015
Guys? Pack formation.

Humans, in our territory.

157
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:24,754
Hmm.
I think they're a pack.

158
00:08:24,837 --> 00:08:26,339
[whimpering]

159
00:08:26,422 --> 00:08:29,634
I mean, a very weird pack.
But a pack.

160
00:08:29,717 --> 00:08:33,554
They're trespassers.
And what do we do with trespassers?

161
00:08:33,638 --> 00:08:36,766
[all howling]

162
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:38,059
Brother, brother, brother.

163
00:08:38,142 --> 00:08:41,020
Don't be shackled by your instincts.

164
00:08:41,103 --> 00:08:43,731
Remember, we're evolved.

165
00:08:43,814 --> 00:08:45,942
Let knowledge be our prey.

166
00:08:46,567 --> 00:08:49,695
-Let knowledge be our prey!
-[coughs] Nerds.

167
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:51,906
Do you speak for your pack, bug?

168
00:08:51,989 --> 00:08:54,492
-Oh, actually--
-Yep. I'm the alpha of this pack.

169
00:08:54,575 --> 00:08:56,953
And my name is Bone Ripper.

170
00:08:57,787 --> 00:09:01,958
I see. And what exactly
is your pack doing on our turf?

171
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:04,794
We're astronomers.
We've come to share our knowledge.

172
00:09:04,877 --> 00:09:07,296
Oh.
We're the most learned scholars on earth.

173
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:09,924
What could you possibly share
that we don't already know?

174
00:09:10,007 --> 00:09:13,511
There are one-thousand trillion billion
stars in the night sky.

175

But there are even more ways
to shuffle a simple deck of cards.

-Who, Kipo? She's my student.

Hey, look, there's my sign!

Remember when we saw the real Aries
the first night we met?

220
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:18,969
So, in that way, it's kind of our sign.

Time for dinner!

The plan's working.

00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,495
They really like us.

Ooh, yes! Beep-boop.

Apologies if this isn't optimal
for your hardware.

Tonight, we are joined by a pack
that shares our love of the cosmos.

239
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:15,609
And if they can illuminate us
with some knowledge of their own,

240
00:12:15,734 --> 00:12:20,114
perhaps they'll be invited
to our dessert hunt at moonrise.

what we have in common: fear.
