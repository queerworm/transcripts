...which is why I, Kipo Oak,
am inviting you...

6
00:00:22,105 --> 00:00:23,356
to Prahm.

7
00:00:24,274 --> 00:00:27,068
Huh, prom? Like a dance?

8
00:00:27,152 --> 00:00:29,612
No, Prahm, like, P-R-A-H-M.

9
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:31,740
A Party Reconciling All Humans and Mutes.

10
00:00:31,823 --> 00:00:33,950
But also, yes. There will be dancing.

11
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:34,909
Yes!

12
00:00:34,993 --> 00:00:37,787
If you could hear the Timbercats
shred on a banjo,

13
00:00:37,871 --> 00:00:41,041
and if they could taste
one of Mrs. Graham's cakes,

14
00:00:41,124 --> 00:00:43,501
there's no way you'd hate each other.

15
00:00:43,585 --> 00:00:47,380
If you come to Prahm, you'll see that you
have more in common than you think.

16
00:00:47,464 --> 00:00:49,132
[Emilia]
This is clearly a trap!

17
00:00:49,674 --> 00:00:52,135
Who throws a party in the middle of a war?

18
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:53,803
[everyone]
Kipo.

19
00:00:53,887 --> 00:00:54,846
[snorts]

20
00:00:54,929 --> 00:00:55,972
So, what do you say?

21
00:00:56,055 --> 00:00:58,349
Yes, yes, a thousand times yes!

22
00:00:58,433 --> 00:01:01,352
We're not war people, we're burrow people.

23
00:01:01,436 --> 00:01:04,689
We like fun museums
and giving each other compliments.

24
00:01:04,773 --> 00:01:07,108
-You're doing great, Doag!
-[Doag] Thank you.

25
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:13,490
Great! Meet us tomorrow
at Skyscraper Ridge.

26
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:16,576
-I'll be going.
-[crowd gasping]

27

28
00:01:25,502 --> 00:01:26,377
Cool.

00:02:11,756 --> 00:02:14,634
Gah! Feel the Zane!

38
00:02:15,343 --> 00:02:18,012
-All clear.
-Zane, you don't have to do that anymore.

39
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:22,684
Right, because I'm on the side
of the mutes, now.

40
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:24,853
So, who's the enemy?

41
00:02:24,936 --> 00:02:26,229
There isn't one.

42
00:02:26,729 --> 00:02:29,816
Right.
What if I like doing it?

43
00:02:29,899 --> 00:02:31,484
Then follow your bliss, buddy.

44
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:34,529
Gah! I'm doing it!

45
00:02:34,612 --> 00:02:36,531
-Yeah, baby, do it!
-[grunting]

46
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:39,534
-Hah!
-Uhh!

47
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:42,203
-Huh!
-Gah!

48
00:02:42,287 --> 00:02:43,246
Ha!

49
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:44,497
Something's not right.

50
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:46,875
Is it the walking?
'Cause I hate walking, too.

51
00:02:46,958 --> 00:02:49,002
Why don't we skate everywhere?
Think about that, hm?

52
00:02:49,085 --> 00:02:51,337
It's not that. I-it's Emilia.

53
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:54,924
She agreed to Prahm, then smiled.

54
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:56,926
Something's up. I can feel it.

55
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:59,637
Even if you're right,
I don't think she can do anything.

56
00:02:59,721 --> 00:03:03,141
She knows her cure won't work on me,
and she's lost her army.

57
00:03:03,224 --> 00:03:04,767
It kinda feels like we won.

58
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:06,352
Well, half won.

59
00:03:06,436 --> 00:03:09,731
We only have until tomorrow to convince
all of the mutes in Las Vistas

60
00:03:09,814 --> 00:03:12,609
to come to a party with the people
who just attacked them.

61
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:16,446
I'll help. I'm charismatic
and people respect my strong jawline.

62
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:19,365
Um... that is true,

63
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:22,243
but I think you, Doag,
and everyone else from the boat

64
00:03:22,327 --> 00:03:23,870
should just meet me after.

65
00:03:23,953 --> 00:03:25,788
They might be a teeny bit upset that--

66
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:27,790
You didn't sink the boat?!

67
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:29,667
[angry mumbling and shouting]

68
00:03:37,342 --> 00:03:40,428
Are you really gonna
just stand by and let this happen?

69
00:03:41,679 --> 00:03:44,432
[clears throat] Doctor,
we can't just give up.

70
00:03:44,515 --> 00:03:46,851
I don't give up.

71
00:03:46,935 --> 00:03:48,978
[roaring]

72
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:51,064
[gasps] I'll turn on the emitter!

73
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:54,609
No, Greta. Let it come.

74
00:03:56,778 --> 00:03:58,446
[Timbercat]
So, instead of sinking the boat,

75
00:03:58,529 --> 00:04:00,323
you invited them to a dance?

76
00:04:00,406 --> 00:04:02,242
-Who does that?
-Kipo.

77
00:04:02,325 --> 00:04:04,702
Listen. Sinking the boat
wasn't the answer.

78
00:04:04,786 --> 00:04:08,581
But Prahm won't bring our friends back
from what the humans did to them.

79
00:04:08,665 --> 00:04:13,920
I tried to make BradLand, but in the end,
it was more like SadLand.

80
00:04:14,003 --> 00:04:15,505
-[meows]
-Aah!

81
00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:16,965
-[hissing]
-[Jamack] No, Yumyan!

82
00:04:17,048 --> 00:04:18,383
No--Yumyan, no! Bad kitty!

83
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:23,513
I know we've lost friends.
I understand why you want revenge.

84
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:26,766
I'm asking a lot,
but if you can forgive today,

85
00:04:26,849 --> 00:04:29,102
we can build a better tomorrow.

86
00:04:29,185 --> 00:04:32,105
That's how we make sure
this never happens again.

87
00:04:32,188 --> 00:04:35,066
You can't forgive someone
that's not sorry!

88
00:04:35,149 --> 00:04:36,734
-I wanted a sunk boat!
-[angry crowd noise]

89
00:04:36,818 --> 00:04:40,446
Yeah! I want them to apologize
for what they did to Camille.

90
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:42,198
-[voice 1] Yeah, and Jeff!
-[voice 2] Oh, wait, no the wolfs...

91
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:44,534
-[voice 3] And Carton!
-[voice 4] And Wheels!

92
00:04:46,661 --> 00:04:47,745
And Yumyan.

93
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:52,667
Sorry, Kipo. We can't afford
to lose anyone else.

94
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:55,128
I hereby resign from HMUFA.

95
00:04:55,211 --> 00:04:56,337
Wait, what?

96
00:04:56,796 --> 00:04:57,755
Uh...

97
00:05:00,258 --> 00:05:01,259
Me too, man.

98
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:10,184
They all left.

99
00:05:10,685 --> 00:05:11,936
[footsteps approaching]

100
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:15,940
Not everyone.

101
00:05:16,691 --> 00:05:17,984
You guys are staying?

102
00:05:18,067 --> 00:05:19,610
Every Prahm needs a king.

103
00:05:19,694 --> 00:05:22,155
Yeah, and, you know,
I already got my suit on, so.

104
00:05:22,238 --> 00:05:26,200
And I, Dave,
also stay bravely by your side.

105
00:05:26,284 --> 00:05:29,203
What a guy, ain't he amazing?
I met him once, he was cool.

106
00:05:30,538 --> 00:05:32,040
-[coughs]
-[gasps]

107
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:34,834
I live here. You guys should go.

108
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:46,137
Huh!

109
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:48,097
[exhales] I needed that.

110
00:05:48,389 --> 00:05:49,891
OK. Now we decorate.

111
00:05:49,974 --> 00:05:53,019
Wait, Prahm's not off? But they said no.

112
00:05:53,102 --> 00:05:54,771
They seemed pretty mad, remember?

113
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:56,647
We just didn't ask them right.

114
00:05:56,731 --> 00:05:57,982
They need an apology.

115
00:05:58,066 --> 00:06:00,318
-And it needs to come from us.
-Right.

116
00:06:00,401 --> 00:06:02,820
And we need to live it.
We need to dance it.

117
00:06:02,904 --> 00:06:04,447
-Yes!
-Dance it?

118
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:07,366
We need to Prahm-pose.

119
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:09,744
I have no idea what you guys
are talking about.

120
00:06:09,827 --> 00:06:11,788
Right. Prahm-posing
is an ancient tradition

121
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:13,623
that goes all the way back
to the old world.

122
00:06:13,706 --> 00:06:16,167
If you want someone to go with you to
Prahm, you've got to Prahm-pose to them.

123
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:18,127
It's the perfect way
to get the mutes to join us.

124
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:20,046
Plus, nobody can say no to a float.

125
00:06:20,129 --> 00:06:21,506
What's a float?

126
00:06:21,589 --> 00:06:25,176
Only the most exciting and visual way
to celebrate all of our differences.

127
00:06:39,357 --> 00:06:40,483
Hoo! Hah!

128
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:42,902
Whoo! Hah!

129
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:49,408
[Scarlemagne] After this works and Prahm
is a raging success,

130
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:54,497
I'm guessing it'll take nine minutes
for Emilia to turn on us and attack.

131
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:55,957
I would've guessed five.

132
00:06:56,457 --> 00:06:57,917
So, we're in agreement?

133
00:06:59,627 --> 00:07:01,587
Um, did you pilfer the pail of flora?

134
00:07:02,296 --> 00:07:04,382
-No.
-Then who did?

135
00:07:10,138 --> 00:07:11,347
I made a you.

136
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:14,016
I'm--I'm sorry, why do I
only have one eye?

137
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:14,934
I got tired.

138
00:07:15,685 --> 00:07:16,561

[imitates airplane]

140
00:07:24,152 --> 00:07:26,737
Whatchu thinkin' 'bout?

141
00:07:26,821 --> 00:07:31,367
Troy. I wanna ask him to Prahm,
but it's gotta be really good.

142
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:33,661
You know, to make up
for how we can't just hang out

143
00:07:33,744 --> 00:07:35,371
because we're always saving the world.

144
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:38,541
Whoa! I was thinking about
how french fries are the perfect food.

145
00:07:38,624 --> 00:07:41,335
Well, Troy is the french fries
of boyfriends,

146
00:07:41,419 --> 00:07:43,921
and he deserves the perfect Prahm-posal.

147
00:07:44,005 --> 00:07:45,965
OK, if we're not
grabbing some french fries,

148
00:07:46,048 --> 00:07:47,675
you need to stop bringing them up.

149
00:07:47,758 --> 00:07:49,093
You brought them up!

150
00:07:50,761 --> 00:07:51,637
Huh?

151
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:53,931
The ladder's missing, too?

152
00:07:54,015 --> 00:07:57,810
T'would appear we have
a saboteur in our midst.

153
00:07:58,394 --> 00:07:59,645
What?

154
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:03,316
[mega walrus growling]

155

156
00:08:08,571 --> 00:08:10,823
[hisses] Bad walrus! Get out of here!

[screaming]

158
00:08:13,242 --> 00:08:16,162
Looks like your Prahm date's here.

159
00:08:16,662 --> 00:08:18,498
[cheering and applause]

160
00:08:18,581 --> 00:08:20,875
[Kipo exhales] Amazing job, everyone!

161
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:23,252
Now, let's rehearse. Positions!

162
00:08:29,091 --> 00:08:30,259
Hmm.

163
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:32,178
Kipo, can we talk to you?

164
00:08:32,803 --> 00:08:34,847
Like, together? Both of you?

165
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:36,516
Oh, my gosh! You bonded!

166
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:38,809
-That's not what's happening.
-Not a big deal!

167
00:08:40,728 --> 00:08:43,189
OK. When she says go,
we burst out the top.

168
00:08:45,107 --> 00:08:48,402
For reasons most obvious,
we don't trust Emilia.

169
00:08:48,486 --> 00:08:51,864
We've noticed that a paint bucket
and a ladder have gone missing.

170
00:08:51,948 --> 00:08:55,952
OK. A-are you saying this is
the same thing or two different things?

171
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:59,121
We don't know, but we should
mount our defenses immediately.

172
00:08:59,664 --> 00:09:02,375
OK. Possible that you're bringing out
the worst in each other.

173
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:03,793
Come on, isn't it obvious?

174
00:09:03,876 --> 00:09:06,879
Emilia doesn't want Prahm to happen,
so, she's being a sabater.

175
00:09:06,963 --> 00:09:08,130
[clears throat] Saboteur.

176
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:13,636
OK. Well, I didn't
invite Emilia to a battle.

177
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:16,305
Prahm only works if we all believe in it.

178
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:17,848
You can't seriously believe

179
00:09:17,932 --> 00:09:21,394
Emilia is going to give up
her life's work to frolic with mutes.

180
00:09:21,477 --> 00:09:23,771
I won't know unless I give her the chance.

181
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:28,109
-Uh, Kipo?
-I'm not changing my mind on this.

182
00:09:28,192 --> 00:09:29,402
The float's gone.

183
00:09:30,653 --> 00:09:32,029
Oh, come on!

184
00:09:40,037 --> 00:09:41,622
Ugh! No more tracks.

185
00:09:41,706 --> 00:09:43,749
And I still can't pick up
the sabater's scent.

186
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:45,876
[sighs] OK. Now you're just
doing it to annoy me.

187
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:46,836
[leaves rustling]

188
00:09:49,338 --> 00:09:51,299
Ah! Come out, Emilia!

189
00:09:53,551 --> 00:09:54,844
-Aah!
-Who's Emilia?

190
00:09:54,927 --> 00:09:56,512
Are you looking for her?
'Cause you found us.

191
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:58,222
-But who are we?
-That's Kameko.

192
00:09:58,306 --> 00:09:59,181
And that's Jeanine.

193
00:09:59,724 --> 00:10:02,518
Ugh, of course. Treasure Squirrels.

194
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:06,647
Well, our friends mysteriously vanished
inside a giant float and--

195
00:10:06,731 --> 00:10:08,816
[laughs] What a coincidence!

196
00:10:08,899 --> 00:10:10,735
We just found a float at Skyscraper Ridge!

197
00:10:10,818 --> 00:10:12,320
And then we hid it!

198
00:10:12,403 --> 00:10:14,572
[whispering] We hide all our treasures
to keep them safe.

199
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:16,490
So, Emilia wasn't our saboteur.

200
00:10:16,574 --> 00:10:18,451
-I suppose not.
-This time.

201
00:10:18,534 --> 00:10:20,494
That float was filled with people.

202
00:10:20,578 --> 00:10:22,705
So, if you could show us
where you hid it--

203
00:10:22,788 --> 00:10:24,832
Yeah! Let's go save your treasures!

204
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:28,419
Eh... uh...

205
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:32,506
-What are we waiting for?
-For you to tell us where they are.

206
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:33,799
Oh, yeah! [laughs]

207
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:35,676
-That's Kameko, by the way.
-And that's Jeanine!

208
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,511
We're going on a treasure hunt!

209
00:10:37,595 --> 00:10:40,139
-Oh, good. This is gonna be fun.
-We're going on a treasure hunt!

210
00:10:40,222 --> 00:10:42,266
We're going on a treasure hunt!

211
00:10:43,184 --> 00:10:45,102
Uh, Kipo?

212
00:10:45,186 --> 00:10:47,563
Hey, Kipo! It's getting hot in here!

213
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:49,065
Yeah, why'd you move us?

214
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:50,941
Why do you think she's not answering us?

215
00:10:51,025 --> 00:10:52,693
Are we dead?

216
00:10:52,777 --> 00:10:53,611
[gasps]

217
00:10:55,363 --> 00:10:57,281
Panic setting in. [chuckles]

218
00:10:57,365 --> 00:10:58,991
Everyone stay calm!

219
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:01,702
We're going on a treasure hunt!

220
00:11:01,786 --> 00:11:03,704
-We're going on a treasure hunt!
-Treasure hunt! Treasure hunt!

221
00:11:03,788 --> 00:11:05,539
-On a treasure hunt!
-Here we go!

222
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:07,249
-Ah, ah, ah ,ah,!
-Ho, ho, ho, ho!

223
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:09,752
Where is the float? Tell us! Tell us, now!

224
00:11:09,835 --> 00:11:13,422
-You're looking for a float?
-What a coincidence. We found one!

225
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:15,883
We know! You were
going to show us where you hid it.

226
00:11:15,966 --> 00:11:18,469
We can never remember
where we put our treasures.

227
00:11:18,552 --> 00:11:20,888
-Shocker.
-No, that's Kameko.

228
00:11:20,971 --> 00:11:23,057
And that's Treasure Hill.

229
00:11:25,434 --> 00:11:28,521
By chance, do you
bury your treasures there?

230
00:11:28,604 --> 00:11:32,191
Oh-ho, ho! I just remembered that yes!

231
00:11:32,274 --> 00:11:33,401
[laughing]

232
00:11:42,243 --> 00:11:43,244
[growl]

233
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:47,998
Benson! Dave! Anyone!

234
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:51,210
[laughing]

235
00:11:52,336 --> 00:11:53,170
[laughing]

236
00:11:53,254 --> 00:11:55,297
Good suggestion to play a game, Lio.

237
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:56,882
It calmed everyone down.

238
00:11:56,966 --> 00:11:58,342
Almost everyone.

239
00:11:58,426 --> 00:12:01,011
[anxious chuckling]

240
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:04,056
Hah! Too fast.

241
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:06,183
I've got the reflexes of a tiger shark.

242
00:12:06,267 --> 00:12:09,019
-Tiger sharks don't have good refl-- aah!
-Hah! Gotcha.

243
00:12:09,103 --> 00:12:11,021
-[laughing]
-[loud thud]

244
00:12:12,022 --> 00:12:14,567
I'm starting to think
we're trapped in here!

245
00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:17,486
Hey guys, I'm sensing
some freaked-out vibes,

246
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:20,448
-but I know Kipo will find us.
-I'm gonna die!

247
00:12:20,531 --> 00:12:23,325
I didn't even get to ask him to Prahm.

248
00:12:24,785 --> 00:12:25,703
[laughing]

249
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:29,915
I get it. Asking someone to Prahm
is a lot of pressure.

250
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:31,625
I just want it to be perfect.

251
00:12:31,709 --> 00:12:33,335
Don't worry about all of that.

252
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:35,754
You just have to be confident.
Check it out.

253
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:38,591
Hey, Song, you wanna go to Prahm with me?

254
00:12:38,716 --> 00:12:40,593
No... duh!

255
00:12:40,676 --> 00:12:43,804
Whoo! What a ride. [chuckles]
I was nervous when I heard no,

256
00:12:43,888 --> 00:12:46,140
but I felt a lot better
when you got to the "duh."

257
00:12:46,223 --> 00:12:47,099
Your turn.

258
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:49,226
[exhales]

259
00:12:50,102 --> 00:12:51,145
Hey, Troy.

260
00:12:51,228 --> 00:12:53,147
-You wanna go to-- huh?
-[roaring]

261
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:54,857
Kipo! Over here!

262
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:57,067
Please help us, there's not much air left!

263
00:12:57,151 --> 00:12:58,736
What? I need air!

264
00:12:58,819 --> 00:13:01,405
-[Lio in distance] Over here! Kipo!
-[gasps]

265
00:13:01,489 --> 00:13:02,865
[growls]

266
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,618
Treasure!

267
00:13:06,327 --> 00:13:09,205
[Wolf] That's our stuff!
The float's gotta be in there, too.

268
00:13:15,586 --> 00:13:17,379
[growling]

269
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:24,220
[screaming]

270
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:27,723
[screaming, grunting]

271
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:31,685
[screaming]

272
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:38,609
Aah!

273
00:13:40,444 --> 00:13:41,654
[panting, grunting]

274
00:13:45,741 --> 00:13:46,575
Huh?

275
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:48,077
[growling]

276
00:13:52,623 --> 00:13:53,916
Aah!

277
00:13:54,124 --> 00:13:55,000
Uhh!

278
00:14:01,757 --> 00:14:02,591
-Oh.
-[gasps]

279
00:14:03,926 --> 00:14:05,261
No! Kipo!

280
00:14:05,761 --> 00:14:07,346
[grunting]

281
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:09,056
Are you OK?

282
00:14:09,139 --> 00:14:10,849
[with effort] I'm fine.

283
00:14:10,933 --> 00:14:12,434
You could have been killed.

284
00:14:13,018 --> 00:14:13,894
[chuckles]

285
00:14:16,313 --> 00:14:18,649
[screaming and groaning]

286
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:21,235
[gasping for air] Oh, sweet!

287
00:14:21,318 --> 00:14:22,903
Sweet air!

288
00:14:22,987 --> 00:14:26,115
Phew! I knew everything
would work out in the end.

289
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:31,537
[Dave gagging] Tasted my lunch again.
I only wanted to eat it once.

290
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:34,456
-[loud thud]
-That was double the calories. [groans]

291
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:37,042
Thank you, sweet jaguar girl!

292
00:14:37,126 --> 00:14:40,880
We will never lose our treasures again!

293
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:44,133
But what if somebody else finds them
and takes them from us?

294
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:46,218
Oh, yeah. We better start hiding them.

295
00:14:46,427 --> 00:14:47,261
Not this one!

296
00:14:48,596 --> 00:14:50,306
[roaring]

297
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,685
-[grunts]
-Huh!

298
00:14:54,768 --> 00:14:57,313
[panting] Ha-- Ohh!

299
00:14:59,023 --> 00:14:59,899
[gasps]

300
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:04,361
-[gasps]
-[growling]

301
00:15:08,198 --> 00:15:09,283
Hah!

302
00:15:09,366 --> 00:15:10,242
Huh!

303
00:15:12,995 --> 00:15:13,871
Oh.

304
00:15:25,257 --> 00:15:26,550
Ho!

305
00:15:29,136 --> 00:15:30,638
[groaning]

306
00:15:37,728 --> 00:15:41,440
The only way to defeat a mega jaguar
is with a mega of our own.

307
00:15:49,573 --> 00:15:50,449
Ahh!

308
00:15:50,866 --> 00:15:52,576
[grunting]

309
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:54,078
Where are you going?

310
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:56,789
To eliminate our Emilia problem.

311
00:15:56,872 --> 00:15:58,749
[grunting]

312
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:00,834
I can't let you do that.

313
00:16:00,918 --> 00:16:02,670
We both know Kipo.

314
00:16:02,753 --> 00:16:06,465
She's always so focused on others,
she doesn't consider her own safety.

315
00:16:06,548 --> 00:16:10,094
We just rescued her from one avalanche,
but there's another avalanche coming.

316
00:16:10,177 --> 00:16:12,221
And someone has to stop it.

317
00:16:12,888 --> 00:16:14,264
Emilia's the second avalanche.

318
00:16:14,348 --> 00:16:15,975
Yeah, I got that.

319
00:16:16,058 --> 00:16:17,559
But I won't go behind her back.

320
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:19,853
Ah, she's like a sister to you.

321
00:16:19,937 --> 00:16:21,981
Believe it or not, I feel the same.

322
00:16:22,523 --> 00:16:24,692
We'd both do anything to protect her.

323
00:16:24,775 --> 00:16:27,736
And that's why you're going to let me go.

324
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:39,790
[Kipo]
Thanks for helping us.

325
00:16:39,873 --> 00:16:42,418
-I'm Kameko!
-OK.

326
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:46,005
I'm just gonna write the details
for Prahm right here, so you don't forget.

327
00:16:46,088 --> 00:16:47,965
[chuckling] Great! We'll be there.

328
00:16:48,048 --> 00:16:51,677
Whoa! I found a treasure map on my hand!

329
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:52,720
Where do you think it leads?

330
00:16:52,803 --> 00:16:55,014
-We're going on a treasure hunt!
-We're going on a treasure hunt!

331
00:16:55,097 --> 00:16:57,975
-Going from my thumb to my pinkie...
-[sighs]

332
00:16:58,434 --> 00:16:59,309
All right, everyone.

333
00:16:59,393 --> 00:17:02,146
This is our one chance
to make Prahm happen

334
00:17:02,229 --> 00:17:04,440
and peace on the surface forever and ever.

335
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:06,025
-[gasping]
-[Kipo] Are. You. Ready.

336
00:17:06,108 --> 00:17:07,735
To. Prahm. Pose?

337
00:17:12,156 --> 00:17:14,199
What is this, some kind of new toy?

can't really come to Prahm

It's my fault. The high kicks
weren't high enough,

It was too perfect and highlighted

We did our best. Now,
we just have to see what they say.

[exhales]

379
00:19:26,456 --> 00:19:30,961
Troy, I've been trying all day to think
of the perfect way to ask you to Prahm.

380
00:19:31,044 --> 00:19:35,007
Because you're amazing and awesome
and that's what you deserve.

But what I've realized is...

382
00:19:37,593 --> 00:19:40,429
I'm not perfect. Nothing is.

Not even french fries.

He's right. They should be
called potato noodles!

385
00:19:45,809 --> 00:19:48,228
So, I'm not gonna try
to be perfect anymore.

386
00:19:48,312 --> 00:19:49,897
I'm just gonna be me.

Will I go to Prahm with you?

Aah! I asked weird! I screwed it up!

No, no, that was really cute.

391
00:19:59,156 --> 00:20:02,117
It's just, I was literally
about to ask you.

Prahm is a great idea,
