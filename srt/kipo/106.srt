Allegro!
Allegro, my lords and ladies!

6
00:00:28,111 --> 00:00:29,237
Faster!

11
00:00:40,832 --> 00:00:43,418
What's that you say?
Even faster?

12
00:00:43,501 --> 00:00:45,420
OK!
[laughs]

13
00:00:45,503 --> 00:00:47,547

We have party crashers.
How rude.

19
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:17,202
Oh, the two eggheads.

20
00:01:17,285 --> 00:01:19,579
Have you found my new army yet?

21
00:01:19,662 --> 00:01:23,958
Huh...
Scarlemagne's palace, in the real.

22
00:01:24,042 --> 00:01:25,585
I love what you've done with it.

23

[sniffing]

24
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:29,923
-Smells like weird perfume in here.
-Oh, that?

[snaps finger]

26
00:01:31,257 --> 00:01:33,968
It's a natural fragrance.
Made it myself.

27
00:01:34,052 --> 00:01:36,054
Literally, from my own pheromones.

28
00:01:36,137 --> 00:01:37,972
[exhales, panting]

29
00:01:38,056 --> 00:01:42,811
Don't worry, it won't work on you canines.
Just primates.

30
00:01:44,312 --> 00:01:47,732
But I only use it
on a certain class of primate.

31
00:01:47,816 --> 00:01:51,277
The lesser ones.
Even a monkey has his standards.

32
00:01:51,361 --> 00:01:54,405
[laughs]
I renamed him Francis.

33
00:01:54,489 --> 00:01:57,075
He just learned the can-can.

Now, why did you have
my flamingos bring you here?

37
00:02:06,626 --> 00:02:09,003
Come on, man.
We did rock-paper-scissors.

38
00:02:09,087 --> 00:02:10,255
You tell him why.

39
00:02:10,338 --> 00:02:15,677
Um, so, uh, you remember that telescope
that we used to have?

40
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,762
Mm-hmm?

42
00:02:20,723 --> 00:02:24,853
I've lost my eyes to the city!
So, I need new eyes!

43
00:02:24,936 --> 00:02:30,608
Eyes to find the humans
who escaped from that burrow!

44
00:02:30,692 --> 00:02:34,821
If there's a human out there,
I want it dancing for me by dawn!

[Benson grunts]
Three-point-two-six-two.

48
00:02:59,762 --> 00:03:01,347
If your father was gonna leave a message,

49
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:03,266
couldn't it have been
something more simple?

50
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:04,309
Like an arrow?

51
00:03:04,392 --> 00:03:07,896
[Kipo] Then anybody could follow it.
No, this is perfect.

52
00:03:07,979 --> 00:03:11,983
It's big enough so he knew I would see it,
but only I would know it was a message.

53
00:03:12,066 --> 00:03:15,236
Except, I have no clue
what the message is.

54
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:18,489
But it must mean something to you.
Otherwise, we wouldn't be here.

55
00:03:18,573 --> 00:03:22,076
In lightyears, 3.262
is the length of a parsec.

56
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:24,120
-A what-sec?
-Parsec.

57
00:03:24,203 --> 00:03:27,206
It's an astronomical unit.
Dad's a bit of a science nerd.

58
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:28,875
Yeah, we're aware.

59
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:32,921
It also happens to be my birthday.
March 26, at 2:00 am.

60
00:03:33,004 --> 00:03:34,589
That's why it was Dad's favorite number.

61
00:03:35,131 --> 00:03:36,883
And guess what day today is, Mandu?

62
00:03:36,966 --> 00:03:38,635
[squeals]

63
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:42,805
-Laundry day!
-Whoa... Kipo, is today your b-day?

64
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:45,183
If you mean,
did my Dad and I decorate this date

65
00:03:45,266 --> 00:03:47,435
in my calendar back home
with balloon stickers?

66
00:03:47,518 --> 00:03:50,438
-Yes!
-Kipo's first birthday topside.

67
00:03:50,521 --> 00:03:53,858
-Don't know why, but it sounds big.
-We should go out!

68
00:03:53,942 --> 00:03:57,237
For a city where nothing's open ever,
there's surprisingly a lot to do here.

69
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:01,074
Ugh, I can't celebrate
until we figure out this clue.

70
00:04:01,157 --> 00:04:04,369
[mimics Dad] Kipo, the answer is
in front of you. Apply yourself.

71
00:04:04,452 --> 00:04:06,204
[herself] I'm trying, Dad.

72
00:04:06,287 --> 00:04:08,915
You know you made this
really difficult to solve.

73
00:04:08,998 --> 00:04:11,417
[mimics Dad]
Because challenges build character.

74
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:13,753
[herself]
I don't need any more character.

75
00:04:13,836 --> 00:04:15,296
I just need to find you!

76
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:16,214

77
00:04:17,006 --> 00:04:20,176
Uh, did she just have
a whole conversation with herself?

00:04:23,179 --> 00:04:24,222
[both gasping]

80
00:04:28,017 --> 00:04:30,520
Now we're the only ones
who know about this clue,

81
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:33,481
and only we can follow it.
You're welcome.

82
00:04:33,564 --> 00:04:36,734
There's a word I'm looking for.
Uh, what is it?

83
00:04:36,818 --> 00:04:38,236
Overkill!

84
00:04:38,569 --> 00:04:41,155
Parsec. Parsec, parsec.

85
00:04:48,746 --> 00:04:51,124
Just one is nineteen trillion miles.

86
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:54,877
Ugh, maybe that's how far away
my people are.

87
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:58,214
Ugh, Kipo, you've been at it for hours.

88
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:00,633
Look, sometimes Dave and I
do old crosswords.

89
00:05:00,717 --> 00:05:04,304
And when we get stuck, we put it down
and we go away for a little while.

90
00:05:04,387 --> 00:05:08,641
Yeah, and then the answer presents itself.
[snores]

91
00:05:08,725 --> 00:05:11,853
So, maybe we pause the clue-cracking.
How old are you turning?

92
00:05:11,936 --> 00:05:14,355
-Thirteen.
-That's a big deal!

93
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:16,399
-[grunts]
-We have to celebrate!

94
00:05:16,482 --> 00:05:18,568
I'm sure your dad, wherever he is,

95
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:20,611
would want you to take some time
to have fun today.

96
00:05:20,695 --> 00:05:22,947
I do love birthdays.

97
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:25,033
-When's your birthday?
-I don't know.

98
00:05:25,116 --> 00:05:27,952
What do you mean you don't know?
Everyone knows their birthday.

99
00:05:28,036 --> 00:05:29,078
Not this everyone.

100
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:32,582
The wolves who raised you
never once threw you a party...

101
00:05:32,665 --> 00:05:36,127
Oh... right.
You don't talk about them.

102
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:40,548
Well, guess what, Wolf?
We're going to be birthday sisters today.

103
00:05:40,631 --> 00:05:42,967
I'm going to celebrate
my first surface birthday,

104
00:05:43,051 --> 00:05:45,178
and you're going to celebrate
your first birthday!

105
00:05:45,261 --> 00:05:47,096
This is a great idea!

106
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:49,974
But first,
you have to get each other presents.

107
00:05:50,058 --> 00:05:52,435
-Wait, presents?
-Of course.

108
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:54,062
They're the best part of birthdays!

109
00:05:54,145 --> 00:05:55,605
Meet back here when you find something.

110
00:05:55,688 --> 00:05:58,733
By the way, I like things that are purple.
And board games!

111
00:05:58,816 --> 00:06:00,109
Good luck!

112
00:06:00,651 --> 00:06:02,737

114
00:06:04,947 --> 00:06:06,365
Great.

115
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:18,503
Somewhere in here,
we'll find Wolf the perfect gift.

116
00:06:18,586 --> 00:06:22,340
Right. Like they say, one man's trash
is another man's treasure.

117
00:06:22,423 --> 00:06:26,219
And, uh, we found ourselves
a real treasure heap.

118
00:06:26,302 --> 00:06:30,264
Be honest, do you think
they'll be OK out there? My people.

119
00:06:30,348 --> 00:06:33,059
Because everywhere you go,
something's trying to capture you,

120
00:06:33,142 --> 00:06:35,561
eat you, step on you...
[gasps]

121
00:06:37,105 --> 00:06:38,022
Or worse.

122
00:06:42,151 --> 00:06:45,571
Sometimes you see stuff like that around.
It's best to ignore it.

123
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:47,573
How about some tunes?

Wow, that's a treasure, all right.

127
00:06:56,415 --> 00:06:59,252
It is.
It's the perfect gift for Wolf.

128
00:06:59,794 --> 00:07:03,131
Mission accomplished.
A little sooner than expected.

-Where to now?
-There's something I want to show you.

It's my present for you.

Canned cheese?
"Made with 12 percent real cheese."

132

What's the rest of it made of?

Know what? Doesn't matter.
I love it!

[laughs] Aw, look at your face.

135
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:21,023
No, that... that's not it.
The real gift is way better. Come on.

Look what I found!

Boom! Nailed it.
Could be a hat, could be a frisbee.

-Frisbee?
-Yeah, check it out!

Next time you ring the dinner bell,
we are done, mute!

From now on, this, this right here,

Well, this is a Wolf-free zone.

No Wolfs allowed over here.

we looking for, anyway?

149
00:08:01,397 --> 00:08:02,690
[Wolf] I'll know it when I see it.

150
00:08:02,773 --> 00:08:05,818
[Dave] Oh, going with your gut.
I like that.

Oh, wow.
It's so festive.

Sometimes, on the surface,

155

there's more than
what you see on the surface.

00:08:29,425 --> 00:08:31,260

00:09:36,158 --> 00:09:38,244
Ah-ha!
It's perfect!

173
00:09:38,327 --> 00:09:40,204
[squealing]

174
00:09:40,288 --> 00:09:42,707
Not now, pig. I'm busy.

175
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:47,545
-What'd ya get?
-It's a mace. See?

176
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:49,630
[clattering]

177
00:09:49,714 --> 00:09:50,965
That wasn't the right gift, anyway.

178
00:09:51,048 --> 00:09:53,593
Well, I found the greatest gift
of all time.

179
00:09:57,346 --> 00:09:59,515
For me, though.
We still have to look for Kipo.

180
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:02,768
That's it! It's just like the one
she liked in Cactustown.

181
00:10:02,852 --> 00:10:05,813
-It's perfect!
-Whoo! [laughs]

182
00:10:05,896 --> 00:10:09,275
-We have to give it to her.
-Who made you jacket boss?

183
00:10:09,358 --> 00:10:13,154
Fine.
Since you found it, you can wear it back.

184
00:10:13,237 --> 00:10:16,866
But then I'm taking it off of you,
one way or another.

185
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:19,493
Long as you don't enter
the Wolf-free zone.

186
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:24,915
What's gotten into you?
Is every mute this annoying?

187
00:10:24,999 --> 00:10:27,209
Hey, I take offence to that...

188
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:29,754
[growls]

189
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:32,340
Oops.

190
00:10:32,423 --> 00:10:35,259
You are truly useless, mute!

191
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:39,221
You know what I think?

192
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:41,349
I think that girl
really doesn't like mutes.

193
00:10:41,432 --> 00:10:43,893
Because I am full of uses.

194
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:47,647
[Amy]
Welcome to the Ratland Mute Cruise.

195
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:50,358
Remember to keep all tails,
paws, and wings

196
00:10:50,441 --> 00:10:53,110
inside the boat at all times,
<i>s'il vous plait.</i>

197
00:10:53,194 --> 00:10:56,155
This place is amazing!
How did you even know it was here?

198
00:10:56,238 --> 00:10:59,283
Well, when you live up here long enough,
you learn a few things.

199
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:02,662
Believe it or not,
it's not all danger all the time.

200
00:11:02,745 --> 00:11:05,956
In fact, the rats made this a safe zone.
All species welcome.

201
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,333
Little known fun fact:

202
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:09,377
easily the best cruise
in this part of town,

203
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:12,254
if I don't mind tootin' my own horn.

204
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:13,172
[horn honking]

205
00:11:13,255 --> 00:11:16,425
Hang on!
Looks like a real party down there, Amy!

206
00:11:19,762 --> 00:11:20,971
[gasps]

207
00:11:24,475 --> 00:11:25,643
[exhales]

208
00:11:25,726 --> 00:11:29,188
Careful, you do not want to get downwind
of those three when they're excited!

209
00:11:29,271 --> 00:11:31,524
-Whoo!
-Oh, Brad! Look out!

210
00:11:31,607 --> 00:11:35,611
Dead ahead!
Is that a Mega Pug I see?

211
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:37,530

-[barking]

213
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:45,454
[Brad] Don't worry, Amy!
I think his bark is worse than his height.

214
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:49,041
These are some of the worst jokes
I've ever heard in my life.

215
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:52,294
-I think I love this ride.
-Rats do love cheese!

216
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:54,213
Oh, man, now I'm doing it, too.

217
00:11:54,296 --> 00:11:55,923
[both laughing]

218
00:11:56,006 --> 00:11:58,676
I couldn't have thought of
a better way to spend my birthday.

219
00:11:58,759 --> 00:12:00,511
I really appreciate this.

220
00:12:00,636 --> 00:12:03,097
[upbeat music plays]

221
00:12:06,767 --> 00:12:08,519
[laughing]

222
00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:21,657
Let the riders off first!

223
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:22,575
Hmph.

224
00:12:22,658 --> 00:12:26,036
-Respect the rules of the park!
-[scoffs] Annual pass holders.

225
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:29,039
You can spot 'em a mile away,
they practically live here.

226
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:31,375
At least they're not chasing us.

227
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:34,879
In fact, this is the first time
we've seen mutes and haven't had to run.

228
00:12:34,962 --> 00:12:38,174
I wasn't kidding about that safe zone.
You can relax here.

229
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:40,342
Stretch your arms.
Enjoy the view.

230
00:12:49,143 --> 00:12:51,854
-[Kipo laughing]
-Which one's that?

231
00:12:51,937 --> 00:12:55,441
-That one is Arcturus.
-How 'bout that one?

232
00:12:55,524 --> 00:12:59,653
Mmm, not a star.
That's a planet. It's Mars.

233
00:12:59,737 --> 00:13:03,324
Wow. There's so much up there
I don't know about.

234
00:13:08,037 --> 00:13:10,873
-You all right?
-Yeah.

235
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:13,751
Sure about that?

236
00:13:13,834 --> 00:13:18,506
[gasps] Oh, uh, you know,
just wish Wolf and Dave were here, too.

237
00:13:18,589 --> 00:13:21,550
[laughs nervously]
They're missing out on all the fun.

238
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:26,388
But, actually,
I wanted to get you here alone.

239
00:13:26,972 --> 00:13:29,934
-You did?
-Yeah. To see this.

240
00:13:30,518 --> 00:13:33,979
I wanted you to know that not everything
on the surface is bad.

241
00:13:34,063 --> 00:13:38,150
That there are places where it's OK.
Better than OK!

242
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:42,154
That there's hope for your people.
That's my real present for you.

243
00:13:42,238 --> 00:13:45,449
And I didn't want anybody,
not naming names, Wolf,

244
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:47,076
to spoil that for you.

245
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:48,661
I love our girl,
but she's been known

246
00:13:48,744 --> 00:13:51,080
to rain down on the occasional parade,
so, you know.

247
00:13:56,835 --> 00:14:01,006
I don't know if it's that I'm turning 13,
but I feel different right now.

248
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:04,051
And I just feel like
I need to tell you that...

249
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:10,057
[sighs] I think I like you.

250
00:14:10,766 --> 00:14:11,767
Oh...

251
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:13,769
Oh! Oh...

252
00:14:13,852 --> 00:14:15,896
[gasps] You don't feel the same.

253
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:19,400
Oh, no! No, I like you, too.
Really, really like you!

254
00:14:19,483 --> 00:14:21,068
You're all kinds of awesome!

255
00:14:21,151 --> 00:14:23,529
But you should know something...
[chuckles]

256
00:14:23,612 --> 00:14:26,198
-You like me as a friend.
-Yes!

257
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:28,993
Because... I'm gay.

258
00:14:29,076 --> 00:14:31,579
Oh... [gasps]
Oh!

259
00:14:31,662 --> 00:14:33,914
I totally misread your signals.

260
00:14:33,998 --> 00:14:36,125
Is it OK if I curl up
into a ball right now?

261
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:40,754
Thank you, though, for just,
uh, I don't know, being you?

262
00:14:40,838 --> 00:14:44,592
OK, that was a really dumb thing to say.

263
00:14:44,675 --> 00:14:49,179
I think I'm just trying to say,
I'm glad we're friends.

264

-[squawking]
-Huh?

265
00:14:52,224 --> 00:14:53,601
Kipo, duck!

266
00:14:54,268 --> 00:14:57,313
I've seen that flamingo before.
It works for Scarlemagne.

267
00:14:57,396 --> 00:14:59,023
That's bad. Really bad.

268
00:14:59,106 --> 00:15:00,566
I thought you said you said
this was a safe zone!

269
00:15:00,649 --> 00:15:03,819
Unfortunately, Scarlemagne
does not obey the safe zone.

270
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:05,070

Roller coaster!

277
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:34,266
No, Kipo! It's too far a drop.
Keep climbing down!

278
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:35,976
You're taking too long!

279

Oh, Kipo. Are you OK?

284
00:15:56,497 --> 00:15:59,792
Uh, yeah. I'm fine.
I don't know what came over me.

285
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:00,751
Kipo?

286
00:16:00,834 --> 00:16:02,461
It was like something else was in control.

287
00:16:02,544 --> 00:16:03,879
-Kipo!
-[squawking]

288
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:06,840
Uh, what happened to your arm?

289
00:16:06,924 --> 00:16:08,342
My arm?

290
00:16:08,425 --> 00:16:11,804
[screams] What's wrong with my arm?
It's all furry!

291
00:16:11,887 --> 00:16:13,973
Benson, why is my arm all furry?

292
00:16:14,056 --> 00:16:16,976
I know sometimes girls your age
go through changes.

293
00:16:17,059 --> 00:16:19,728
Although, that's a pretty big change.

294
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:21,146
I'm not helping, am I?

295
00:16:21,397 --> 00:16:23,399
[squawks]

296
00:16:24,316 --> 00:16:25,693
Run!

[grunting]

298
00:16:34,576 --> 00:16:36,787
[sighs] We need to find another gift.

299
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:38,455
We can go back for the hubcap.

300
00:16:38,539 --> 00:16:41,291
I'll consider telling Kipo
it's from the both of us.

301
00:16:41,917 --> 00:16:43,794
What was the name of that store
where you found it?

302
00:16:43,877 --> 00:16:45,587
I don't know.
Parts... something.

303
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:49,049
Oh! Parts Etc.!
Check out my mind, razor-sharp!

304
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:50,926
Of course!

00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:57,391
P-A-R-S-E-C.
Parsec.

00:16:57,474 --> 00:16:59,184
Dave, you're a genius!

307
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:03,647
I mean, uh, great job...
Well, good job.

308
00:17:03,731 --> 00:17:06,108
Job. Dave. Job.

309
00:17:06,191 --> 00:17:09,111
-I did not follow a word of that.
-We're done searching.

310
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:11,488
We already found Kipo's gift.

[groans]

314
00:17:24,752 --> 00:17:28,380
It's like realizing you might be useful
causes you not to be useful.

315
00:17:32,801 --> 00:17:38,098
-Uh, sure you saw something down here?
-You doubt my eyes?

[panting]

317
00:17:42,102 --> 00:17:44,938
I just want this to go away.
And it won't!

318
00:17:45,022 --> 00:17:47,357
First things first.
We can't stay here.

Humans, wait!

321
00:17:51,153 --> 00:17:54,156
Scarlemagne wants you both
to dance for him.

322
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:55,699
Run!

323
00:18:01,538 --> 00:18:04,249
Respect the rules of the park!

324
00:18:05,459 --> 00:18:06,502
[squawks]

325
00:18:07,044 --> 00:18:08,462
[Amy] Get in!

326
00:18:11,965 --> 00:18:13,675
[Kipo gasps]
He's a human.

327
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:16,762
Benson, do you see that?
That's another human!

328
00:18:16,845 --> 00:18:19,681
So, that's what Scarlemagne
does with the humans.

329
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:20,849
No, thanks!

330
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:22,893
Attention Ratland VIPs,

331
00:18:22,976 --> 00:18:26,105
the park will be closing early
due to an unforeseen air raid.

332
00:18:26,188 --> 00:18:28,107
Better step on it, Brad!

333
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:29,942
Before you go, can we ask you

334
00:18:30,025 --> 00:18:32,778
to fill out a quick survey
rating your experience here at Ratland?

335
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:36,949
If you could try to forget the whole
flamingo rider business

336
00:18:37,032 --> 00:18:38,242
we'd really appreciate it.

337
00:18:38,325 --> 00:18:40,244
Please give us a ten.
Please give us a ten.

338
00:18:40,327 --> 00:18:43,038
Stop it, Brad, you're gonna make them
feel like they have to.

339
00:18:44,915 --> 00:18:46,416
[both] Yes!

340
00:18:52,881 --> 00:18:55,300
[gasps]
It's gone now.

341
00:18:55,384 --> 00:18:57,094
What's happening to me?

342
00:18:57,177 --> 00:19:01,140
I don't know, but you saved our lives
on that Ferris wheel.

343
00:19:01,223 --> 00:19:02,975
I also grew fur!

344
00:19:03,058 --> 00:19:07,604
I've seen a lot of weird stuff up here,
but I've never seen anything like that.

345
00:19:08,689 --> 00:19:12,317
My dad's a scientist,
maybe he'll know what's happening...

346
00:19:12,401 --> 00:19:13,986
If we can find him.

347
00:19:14,069 --> 00:19:17,489
Until then, can we keep this to ourselves?

348
00:19:17,573 --> 00:19:19,074
Of course.

349
00:19:19,533 --> 00:19:22,828
Who knew turning 13 could be so epic?

350
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:41,722
-[snores]
-[gasps]

351
00:19:41,805 --> 00:19:44,057
Must've imagined it.
Wanna move on?

352
00:19:44,141 --> 00:19:46,393
Yeah, this place is dead anyway.

353
00:19:47,311 --> 00:19:49,104
[squawks]

354
00:19:49,897 --> 00:19:52,441
Who was he calling dead?
I'm alive.

355
00:19:54,902 --> 00:19:58,363
Hello? Kipo's dad?
You in here?

356
00:19:58,447 --> 00:20:03,202
[grunts]
Excuse me, young man. No, excuse me.

357
00:20:12,461 --> 00:20:14,880
What is it?
Also, where are we?

358
00:20:14,963 --> 00:20:20,093
It's a ram's head.
That's Kipo's birth sign, Aries.

359
00:20:22,638 --> 00:20:28,644
"Kipo, this will help you
find the second clover. Love, Dad."

360
00:20:28,852 --> 00:20:31,188
Someone drew a spaghetti on the back.

361
00:20:31,813 --> 00:20:33,732
[Wolf] It's a map, Grandpa.

362
00:20:33,815 --> 00:20:36,151
A map to the second clover.

363
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:39,821
Which means,
Kipo's people have a second burrow.

364
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:42,658
Oh, my!
This is the perfect gift.

365
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:44,826
Our little butterscotch will be so happy.

366
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:48,163
She can finally head back
underground with her mole-people

367
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:50,249
and forget we ever existed.

368
00:20:50,332 --> 00:20:52,376
I'll always remember her...

369
00:20:56,171 --> 00:20:57,673
[sighs]

370
00:21:02,636 --> 00:21:03,762
[crying]

371
00:21:03,845 --> 00:21:06,723
Shh-shh-shh!
All right, let's stop the waterworks.

372
00:21:06,807 --> 00:21:08,642
I missed you too, buddy.

373
00:21:09,226 --> 00:21:11,228
[Wolf]
We saw those Flamingo Riders, too.

374
00:21:11,311 --> 00:21:14,106
That may be why Scarlemagne's
after your people.

375
00:21:14,189 --> 00:21:17,651
I think he wants to turn them
into more of his weird Nobles.

376
00:21:17,734 --> 00:21:19,069
Even my dad?

377
00:21:28,328 --> 00:21:29,788
[snorts]

378
00:21:30,706 --> 00:21:34,126
All right, present time.
This is supposed to be our birthday.

379
00:21:39,715 --> 00:21:40,799
[gasps]

380
00:21:42,718 --> 00:21:46,471
Because I noticed whenever you fight,
your hair gets in your eyes.

381
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:50,976
It's, uh, useful. Thanks.

382
00:21:51,059 --> 00:21:52,436
Your turn, birthday twin.

383
00:21:52,519 --> 00:21:53,770
[squeals]

384
00:21:53,854 --> 00:21:55,480
Uh...

385
00:21:57,691 --> 00:22:01,737
Aw, it's from the jacket I liked.
I love it.

386
00:22:02,863 --> 00:22:05,407
-[sighs]
-[snorts]

387
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:06,783
Thank you.

388
00:22:08,285 --> 00:22:10,912
Sweet sleeve!
One man's trash...

389
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:13,457
Is another girl's fashion statement!

390
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:14,791
I don't know about you both,

391
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:17,836
but I am ready to get back
to cracking this clue.

392
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:19,880
Come on.
I feel like walking.

393
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:23,216
It's nice to know
it's not always deadly on the surface.

394
00:22:29,139 --> 00:22:30,807
[sighs]

395
00:22:31,433 --> 00:22:33,935
[growling]

396
00:22:34,895 --> 00:22:36,646
What are you looking at?

397
00:22:37,064 --> 00:22:38,482
[groans]

398
00:22:38,565 --> 00:22:40,192
[growls]
