Operation: Find My Parents' Old Burrow.

Where do we find it?
How do we find it?

11
00:00:51,676 --> 00:00:54,804
Where even are we right now?
These are all questions I have.

12
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:57,640
Yeah.
How do we find a burrow so secret

13
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:59,851
not even the all-seeing goats
know where it is?

14
00:00:59,934 --> 00:01:01,478
Oh, oh, oh, oh!
I know who could help us.

15
00:01:01,936 --> 00:01:05,482
She's a dangerous mute with short arms
and even a shorter fuse,

but she knows every secret in the city.
Cappuccino.

Ooh, where can we find her?

18
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:12,947
She runs a restaurant
called Brunchington Beach.

19
00:01:13,031 --> 00:01:15,492
-Best brunch in the city!
-What's a brunch?

20
00:01:15,575 --> 00:01:18,203
It's breakfast and lunch,
combined into one single meal.

21
00:01:18,495 --> 00:01:20,413
Mm, kind of a rip off if you ask me.

22
00:01:20,497 --> 00:01:23,208
Only thing is, you gotta follow
Cappuccino's three rules.

23
00:01:23,291 --> 00:01:25,251
One: everybody pays their own bill.

24
00:01:25,335 --> 00:01:27,921
Two: bills are paid with information.

25
00:01:28,004 --> 00:01:31,966
If you wanna trade,
you better have something juicy. Or else.

You said there were three rules.

28
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:38,890
Uh, the third rule is probably
something like, "wash your hands."

29
00:01:38,973 --> 00:01:40,558
I don't remember.
It'll be fine. Come on.

Uh, guys,
I know he's my best friend and all,

This is definitely gonna get weird.

Sometimes 70.

337
00:17:40,642 --> 00:17:42,561
Stay calm and follow us!

338
00:17:43,395 --> 00:17:45,355
Last call for takeout.

339
00:17:46,523 --> 00:17:47,691
No!

340
00:17:48,192 --> 00:17:50,611
[groans]
Really?

341
00:17:50,694 --> 00:17:52,321
Come on!
Let's get you to cover.

342
00:17:52,821 --> 00:17:54,156
All right.

343
00:17:54,823 --> 00:17:56,784
[squawks]

344
00:17:56,867 --> 00:17:57,993
[screams]

345
00:17:58,494 --> 00:17:59,870
Kipo!

346
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:02,498
[straining] No!

347
00:18:05,501 --> 00:18:07,878
[grunting]

348
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:11,840
[roars]

349
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:17,763
[straining]

350
00:18:21,683 --> 00:18:23,393
-Kipo, don't!
-[gasps]

351
00:18:23,477 --> 00:18:24,686
[grunts]

352
00:18:25,354 --> 00:18:27,523
-[grunts]
-[screams]

353
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:29,858
Launch me.

354
00:18:31,985 --> 00:18:33,612
[screams]

355
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:38,200
Oh, no.

356
00:18:38,575 --> 00:18:40,661
[grunting]

357
00:18:53,924 --> 00:18:55,259
[growling]

358
00:18:55,342 --> 00:18:57,594
Kipo, what was that back there?

359
00:18:57,678 --> 00:19:00,055
[panting]
Herbs out!

360
00:19:01,598 --> 00:19:04,434
I... I don't know.
But it wasn't me.

361
00:19:04,518 --> 00:19:05,894
[squealing]

362
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:07,479
Are-are you guys OK?

363
00:19:07,563 --> 00:19:09,857
Dave was so afraid you were dead,
he started crying.

364
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:12,276
[sniffles]
That's not true!

365
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:14,444
I just got brunch in my eye.

366
00:19:14,528 --> 00:19:17,030
[sighs]
I'm just glad you're both all right.

367
00:19:17,114 --> 00:19:18,824
Aw, thanks, Dave.

368
00:19:18,907 --> 00:19:22,452
-[snorts]
-Hail Kipo! Our conquering hero!

369
00:19:22,536 --> 00:19:25,539
Yours shall be the greatest story
ever told on stage.

370
00:19:25,914 --> 00:19:29,918
And you, the toad who wields his tongue
like a swashbuckler's sword!

371
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:32,880
Have you considered teaching
a course in stage combat?

372
00:19:32,963 --> 00:19:36,300
Oh, sure.
Sure, I could teach ya a thing or two.

373
00:19:36,383 --> 00:19:38,177
But I'm warning you, I'm not cheap.

374
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:42,598
Oh. Jamack, I thought maybe
you'd wanna come with us.

375
00:19:50,522 --> 00:19:52,441
-Absolutely not.
-Good call.

376
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:54,318
You know, I once defeated

377
00:19:54,401 --> 00:19:57,321
four of the most dangerous packs
in Las Vistas single-handed,

378
00:19:57,404 --> 00:19:59,656
so, this is a pretty great investment
on your part.

379
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:02,701
[gasps] You're the valiant frog
with the Mega Bunny steed?

380
00:20:02,784 --> 00:20:05,871
[Jamack] Oh. I got a reputation.
In that case, I'm charging you double.

381
00:20:05,954 --> 00:20:07,039
[Cappuccino] Humans...

382
00:20:09,124 --> 00:20:13,712
I don't know why you helped me
after the way I treated you.

383
00:20:13,795 --> 00:20:19,092
I'm a proud shrimp, but not too proud
to admit that I was wrong.

384
00:20:20,844 --> 00:20:24,723
You, uh, want to know about
that old burrow, right?

385
00:20:27,935 --> 00:20:31,355
Don't worry.
I won't tell anyone where you're headed.

386
00:20:31,813 --> 00:20:33,023
Thank you.

387
00:20:33,106 --> 00:20:36,902
But Scarlemagne doesn't give in to anyone.
They'll be back.

388
00:20:36,985 --> 00:20:40,822
Brunchington Beach is my home.
Let 'em come.

389
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:44,952
Now, why don't you all have
a nice meal before you go.

390
00:20:45,452 --> 00:20:48,455
Really?
But, we're humans.

391
00:20:48,538 --> 00:20:51,333
Yeah, well, nobody's perfect.

392
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:02,719
[sighs]
Brunch. Believe the hype.

393
00:21:04,846 --> 00:21:06,848
[roars]

394
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:12,437
Herbs out.

395
00:21:13,814 --> 00:21:16,608
Uh... hey, guys.

396
00:21:17,401 --> 00:21:20,988
Have you ever had that feeling
where you think you're in control,

397
00:21:21,071 --> 00:21:23,824
but then you're not,
cause a ferocious jaguar's in control

398
00:21:23,907 --> 00:21:25,993
and its need to hunt is insatiable?

399
00:21:26,076 --> 00:21:27,286
[gasps]

400
00:21:30,998 --> 00:21:34,251
Maybe we should find that anchor.
Like now?

401
00:21:35,043 --> 00:21:36,628

00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:39,715
