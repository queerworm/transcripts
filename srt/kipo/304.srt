00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:51,053
[Lio grunts]
Huh.

181
00:07:52,221 --> 00:07:54,474
Blech! I hate water!

182
00:07:54,557 --> 00:07:56,142
No offense, Mulholland.

183
00:07:56,225 --> 00:07:57,685
[sloshing]
Honestly, I get it.

184
00:07:57,768 --> 00:07:59,770
Even I feel like it's too wet sometimes.

185
00:07:59,854 --> 00:08:02,148
Uh, Mulholland, what was that about?

186
00:08:02,231 --> 00:08:04,484
Just keeping it real-tastic, Kipo.

187
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:07,987
You wanted to know the plan,
and she wants you cured like yesterday,

188
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:09,155
plus 13 years.

189
00:08:09,238 --> 00:08:11,491
Is there anything you can do?

190
00:08:11,574 --> 00:08:13,701
Uh, can't you go into her brain
and just like...

191
00:08:13,784 --> 00:08:15,661
uhh, turn on the nice switch?

192
00:08:15,745 --> 00:08:17,747
Ooh, too risky, Kipo-rooni.

193
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:21,083
If the cure got in me
and I got caught in a rainstorm,

194
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:24,295
I could de-mute-- well, everyone.

195
00:08:24,378 --> 00:08:25,546
[splashes]

196
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:27,465
OK, that's terrifying.

197
00:08:27,548 --> 00:08:30,968
And a good reason
why this is still on me.

198
00:08:31,469 --> 00:08:33,429
But I have no idea what to do.

199
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:34,931
Well, we know Emilia's plan.

200
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:36,807
If Mulholland can walk us
through it again,

201
00:08:36,891 --> 00:08:38,100
we'll find a way to beat her.

202
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:40,853
Whoa! What a fun way to use me!

203
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:44,357
Don't even try getting back in here!
There's a third vault now!

204
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,609
I already got everything I need.

205
00:08:46,692 --> 00:08:47,610
Oh, wait! [sloshes]

Hey, you dumb little bacon ball.

212
00:09:02,124 --> 00:09:03,251
Is that for me?

213
00:09:03,334 --> 00:09:04,377
Bring it here.

214
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:08,172
That's it, bring it over.

[Kipo]
Everyone ready?

221
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:24,981
I'm ready if you are, Kipo Beepo.
You're stuck with that one,

222
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:27,066
Let's get this brain-bath over with.

223
00:09:27,149 --> 00:09:30,444
OK, all we have to do is
go into the no-win situation

224
00:09:30,528 --> 00:09:32,113
and win the situation.

225
00:09:32,196 --> 00:09:33,906
How hard can that be?

226
00:09:34,865 --> 00:09:37,368
[sloshes]
Zoop!

227
00:09:37,451 --> 00:09:38,953

You don't know who you're up against.
Kipo will find a way to beat you.

230
00:09:50,923 --> 00:09:53,884
Shut up! Or you'll go boom.

[dings]

233
00:09:58,097 --> 00:09:59,307
Kipo, what do we do?

234
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:00,308
Uh-- I--

235
00:10:00,391 --> 00:10:01,392
Look out!

236
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:03,436
Hello, Kipo.

237
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:04,895
-[splats]
-Ah!

238
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:07,773
I--I couldn't do anything.

239
00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:10,901
M-my best friends
had bombs over their heads.

240
00:10:10,985 --> 00:10:15,072
Everything in me was screaming
to go help them but I couldn't move!

241
00:10:15,156 --> 00:10:20,953
Yeah, your mind was a jimble jamble
of all kinds of feeling, but mostly fear.

242
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:24,999
I'm stress-eating right now.
Mmm, that's better.

243
00:10:25,082 --> 00:10:26,709
I'm a real foodie now that I eat.

244
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:30,212
How do I un-jimble my jamble
so I can save my friends?

245
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:33,507
When I get afraid,
I think of whatever's scaring me,

246
00:10:33,591 --> 00:10:35,593
and make it wear a silly hat.

247
00:10:35,676 --> 00:10:37,345
[sloshes]

248
00:10:37,428 --> 00:10:39,472
Thanks, but maybe not this time, Dad.

249
00:10:39,555 --> 00:10:42,683
If you were a cat,
I'd groom you to calm you down.

250
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:45,519
Yeah, no. But I appreciate it, Yumyan.

251
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:48,105
So, instead, I'll say this--

252
00:10:48,189 --> 00:10:52,652
even the fearless Yumyan Hammerpaw
was afraid, once...

253
00:10:52,735 --> 00:10:56,781
until a brave girl gave me
the push I needed to do better.

254
00:10:56,864 --> 00:10:59,742
And then, she literally
pushed me out of a tree.

255
00:10:59,825 --> 00:11:02,411
Remember?
You were the brave girl.

256
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:07,041
You're right. And as soon as you got down
from that tree, you charged after my mom--

257
00:11:07,124 --> 00:11:10,586
who you didn't know was my mom--
a-and neither did I, so, we're good.

258
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:13,714
Point is-- you pushed your fear down,
you got steamed,

259
00:11:13,798 --> 00:11:15,299
and you did something about it!

260
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:18,469
Look out, Emilia,
because I'm boiling!

261
00:11:18,552 --> 00:11:22,098
Yeah! That's kinda what I was saying.

262
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:24,892
Does that mean
you want another simulation?

263
00:11:24,975 --> 00:11:26,727
-Plug me in!
-[sloshes]

264
00:11:26,811 --> 00:11:30,106
You don't know who you're up against.
Kipo will find a way to beat you.

265
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:32,274
Shut up! Or you'll go boom.

00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:35,653
Hey! Emilia! Kipo owns you all!

Ahoy! You, Scrumples
and Snugglemuffin.

274
00:11:52,711 --> 00:11:53,921
Bring me those blocks.

[Snugglemuffin]
Here you go, Scarmanine.

277
00:11:58,801 --> 00:11:59,969
You may want to move.

[growls]

280
00:12:04,598 --> 00:12:07,309
Long ago, I, myself,
struggled to communicate.

281
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:10,354
So, you gave me letters,
like these, to speak for me.

282
00:12:11,021 --> 00:12:12,565
[grunting]

283
00:12:12,648 --> 00:12:16,902

[roars]

286
00:12:23,367 --> 00:12:25,161
So, that's a non-starter

287
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:27,413
[growls]

288
00:12:27,496 --> 00:12:29,623
You think you're the only one
who's frustrated?

289
00:12:29,707 --> 00:12:31,333
I want that favor.

Ugh!

This is just a soft reminder

314
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:22,801
that we have a hard 37 minutes

315
00:13:22,885 --> 00:13:24,220
before Emilia's deadline.

316
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:26,514
She gets me every time!

317
00:13:26,597 --> 00:13:28,390
Why does she hate me so much?

318
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:31,769
It's not you she hates, Kipo.
It's the future you represent.

319
00:13:31,852 --> 00:13:34,104
She believes humans are superior, period.

320
00:13:34,188 --> 00:13:37,483
Just by existing, you prove
that everything she believes is wrong.

321
00:13:37,566 --> 00:13:39,860
So, she's gonna ruin my life
just to be right?

322
00:13:39,944 --> 00:13:43,030
It happens all the time.
Especially with humans.

323
00:13:43,113 --> 00:13:45,324
Being right
is like their number one thing.

324
00:13:45,407 --> 00:13:46,951
I understand where you're coming from.

325
00:13:47,034 --> 00:13:49,870
Trust me, I've got
plenty of anger toward her myself.

326
00:13:49,954 --> 00:13:53,207
But Emilia is clever
and charging in isn't working.

327
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:54,166
We need to be smart.

328
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:57,962
You're right. Anger's not helping.
I just need to ignore it.

329

Umm...

[Mega Monkey grunting]

335
00:14:14,103 --> 00:14:16,105
Sounds like... Banana?

336
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:17,606

Oh, what rhymes with banana?

00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:19,525

Uh. Havana? Diana?

00:14:19,608 --> 00:14:21,193

00:14:29,243 --> 00:14:31,370
Oh! Uh, rhymes with "peeling"!

00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:02,151
I got that, Snugglemuffin!

354
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:03,777
Just get me something to write on.

355
00:15:04,528 --> 00:15:06,488
[deep breath]

356
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:09,033
OK, Dad, you get the second cure dart.

357
00:15:09,116 --> 00:15:10,618
Yumyan, you're on Greta.

358
00:15:10,701 --> 00:15:12,411
Kipo, just be straight up cool

359
00:15:12,494 --> 00:15:15,164
and ignore the rage and fear
burning inside of you.

360
00:15:15,247 --> 00:15:16,999
[new-age music playing]

361
00:15:17,082 --> 00:15:18,918
[panting] Ah!

362
00:15:19,001 --> 00:15:20,544
[dart whistles through air]

363
00:15:20,628 --> 00:15:22,087
[grunting]

364
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:27,134
Always one step ahead of you, Kipo.

365
00:15:27,217 --> 00:15:29,553
Ugh. I don't want to hear this gloating.

366
00:15:29,637 --> 00:15:32,181
Mulholland!
Why am I not a water explosion?

367
00:15:32,264 --> 00:15:33,265
[Mulholland]
My bad.

368
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:36,143
I don't know what to do!

369
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:40,856
She's right, she's always
one step ahead of me.

370
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,858
-Now, we're out of time.
-[Mulholland chuckles]

371
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:46,737
I'm sorry, Kipo, but that means
it's toodles for old Mulhoodles.

372
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:49,823
W-wait, what? But you'll be here
when we get back, right?

373
00:15:49,907 --> 00:15:53,786
This whole situation's getting
kinda scary, my little space cadet.

374
00:15:53,869 --> 00:15:57,456
If Emilia's this serious
about using the cure on us mutes,

375
00:15:57,539 --> 00:16:00,709
well, I don't think it's safe for anyone
if I stick around.

376
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:03,629
It's been great getting to know you.
I'll miss you.

377
00:16:03,712 --> 00:16:05,631
I've never had friends who aren't me.

378
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:08,884
[sloshing]

379
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:12,262
No! I get it, but no!

380
00:16:12,346 --> 00:16:14,515
You can do this, Kipo Squipo.

381
00:16:14,598 --> 00:16:18,060
You got everything you need, right here.

382
00:16:19,603 --> 00:16:21,105
Zoop!

383
00:16:21,188 --> 00:16:22,731
Almost forgot my hat.

384
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:25,317
Now, I'll always
have a piece of you with me.

385
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:33,575
[Yumyan] Aww,
and just when I started to like water.

386
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:35,869
Just kidding. Gross.

387
00:16:35,953 --> 00:16:37,204
So, what do we do now?

388
00:16:37,287 --> 00:16:39,540
We don't have a choice.
We just have to go.

389
00:16:39,623 --> 00:16:41,250
-[Lio] Oh!
-[Kipo] Ah!

390
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:43,127
Your mother would like a word.

391
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:45,671
[grunting]

392
00:16:45,754 --> 00:16:47,006
[Scarlemagne]
I'll make this fast.

393
00:16:47,089 --> 00:16:48,882
Your mother asked me
to give you a message,

394
00:16:48,966 --> 00:16:51,051
and I, selflessly, agreed to help.

395
00:16:51,135 --> 00:16:52,803
-You did?
-No.

396
00:16:52,886 --> 00:16:54,221
OK, here we go--

397
00:16:54,638 --> 00:16:57,891
"Don't let Emilia
use your feelings against you, honey.

398
00:16:57,975 --> 00:17:00,853
Use her feelings against her."

399
00:17:00,936 --> 00:17:03,647
You have no idea how many charades
it took to get that down.

400
00:17:03,731 --> 00:17:06,108
Great! What does that mean?

401
00:17:06,191 --> 00:17:08,318
Emilia is proud and arrogant.

402
00:17:08,402 --> 00:17:10,195
Let her think she's won.

403
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:11,780
And then crush her.

404
00:17:14,616 --> 00:17:17,369
Ooh, that's good. High five!

405
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:20,831
Thanks, Mom.

406
00:17:20,914 --> 00:17:22,624
[grunting softly]

407
00:17:25,419 --> 00:17:26,754
I think I know what to do now.

408
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:28,422
[clears throat]

409
00:17:28,505 --> 00:17:29,965
Can I borrow that for luck?

410
00:17:33,093 --> 00:17:37,389
OK, as Mulholland would say,
this time is real-tastic.

411
00:17:37,473 --> 00:17:38,974
Aww, I miss him already.

412
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:41,351
Kipo, no matter what happens in there,
I'm proud of you.

413
00:17:41,435 --> 00:17:44,063
I know I've said it before,
but it's a Dad thing.

414
00:17:44,146 --> 00:17:46,982
Like how sometimes instead of saying bye,
I say "Hasta la pasta."

415
00:17:48,025 --> 00:17:49,359
See you on the other side.

416
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:53,530
You don't know who you're up against.
Kipo will find a way to beat you.

417
00:17:53,614 --> 00:17:56,116
Shut up! Or you'll go boom.

418
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,660
-[door squeaks]
-[shouting] Emilia!

419
00:17:58,744 --> 00:17:59,912
[screams]
No, Kipo!

420
00:17:59,995 --> 00:18:02,164
I surrender! Where's Emilia?

421
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:04,208
-Right here.
-[clicks]

422
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:05,709
-[grunts]
-[Benson, Dave] Kipo!

423
00:18:05,793 --> 00:18:08,378
[grunts, exhales]

424
00:18:08,462 --> 00:18:09,713
Kipo!

425
00:18:09,797 --> 00:18:12,800
[grunting]

426
00:18:12,883 --> 00:18:15,928
Thirteen years trying to track you down.

427
00:18:16,011 --> 00:18:17,930
Bye bye, Jaguar Kipo.

428
00:18:18,013 --> 00:18:21,725
You got what you wanted.
Now, give me back my friends.

429
00:18:21,809 --> 00:18:24,186
[scoffs] No-no-no-no-no.

430
00:18:24,269 --> 00:18:26,563
-No one's going free.
-What?

431
00:18:26,647 --> 00:18:29,316
You're all coming back with me
to the ship.

432
00:18:29,399 --> 00:18:32,069
You lied! Why?
What do you want with us?

433
00:18:32,152 --> 00:18:35,906
You're gonna tell everyone
you didn't want to be a mute anymore.

434
00:18:35,989 --> 00:18:37,866
So, you came to me, asking for help.

435
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:40,911
And what, you'll just cure me
as soon as we get there, huh?

436
00:18:40,994 --> 00:18:43,080
Yes, that's exactly right.

437
00:18:43,163 --> 00:18:44,748
[Dave]
I was being sarcastic!

438
00:18:44,832 --> 00:18:47,209
So you just want us to come with you
and lie to everyone?

439
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:48,877
One little lie

440
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:52,131
to get all the burrow humans
to see things my way.

441
00:18:52,214 --> 00:18:54,341
The end justifies the means.

442
00:18:54,424 --> 00:18:56,802
And at the end of the day, I have it all.

443
00:18:56,885 --> 00:19:00,430
Your people, your friends, your DNA.

444
00:19:00,514 --> 00:19:02,558
Thanks for that, by the way.

445
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:03,600
You're welcome.

446
00:19:03,684 --> 00:19:04,852
Why are you smiling?

447
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:08,605
Because I lied, too.

448
00:19:09,857 --> 00:19:10,774
[gasps]

449
00:19:10,858 --> 00:19:13,861

No!

Ahh, the sweet sound
of anything but banjo.

Kipo! That was amazing!

478
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:50,249
Told you you had it under control.

479
00:20:50,332 --> 00:20:51,875
Oh, I knew.

480
00:20:51,959 --> 00:20:54,461
I usually molt when I get scared,
but this time,

481
00:20:54,544 --> 00:20:56,672
-I was too scared to even do that.
-[groans]

482
00:20:56,755 --> 00:20:57,756
I'm just glad everyone's safe.

It's OK. I knew what I signed on to.

Kipo, when you do it,

491
00:21:20,153 --> 00:21:22,239
when you bring everyone to HMUFA,

492
00:21:22,322 --> 00:21:25,701
tell them the stories of Yumyan Hammerpaw.

493
