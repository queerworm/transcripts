00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:34,323
[roaring]

180
00:09:38,286 --> 00:09:39,453
[yells]

181
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:45,126
Sorry, Benson.

182
00:09:53,801 --> 00:09:57,346
The frogs are never done.
They won't stop looking for us.

183
00:09:57,430 --> 00:10:00,891
-Why do they want people so bad?
-I don't really know,

184
00:10:00,975 --> 00:10:03,102
but that's why there's hardly
any of us left up here.

185
00:10:03,185 --> 00:10:05,438
That's why we should stick together.

186
00:10:05,521 --> 00:10:08,190
That's why we should be
helping Benson and Dave.

187
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:10,860
I mean, if we could get to them.

188
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:16,449
How could you do that?
How could you just leave them behind?

189
00:10:16,991 --> 00:10:19,243
Kipo, do you know how valuable you are?

190
00:10:19,327 --> 00:10:22,038
You could lead them
to a whole city full of humans.

191
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:23,497
Just be thankful we got away!

192
00:10:24,498 --> 00:10:27,293
-Thank you.
-You haven't lived up here.

193
00:10:27,376 --> 00:10:28,586
You don't know what it's like.

194
00:10:28,669 --> 00:10:30,004
It's amazing.

195
00:10:30,087 --> 00:10:33,716
In just a day, I've seen enough wonders
to fill a lifetime.

196
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:36,886
I've also seen people
being terrible to each other.

197
00:10:38,387 --> 00:10:39,722
We need to eat.

198
00:10:42,016 --> 00:10:43,476
[Mandu growls softly]

199
00:10:44,602 --> 00:10:46,937
[grunts]
People being terrible?

200
00:10:47,021 --> 00:10:48,564
I'm not being terrible.

201
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:51,776
[grunting]

202
00:10:52,568 --> 00:10:54,070
She doesn't know me.

203
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:56,155
[yells]

204
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:58,199
[groans]

205
00:10:58,282 --> 00:10:59,200
Huh?

206
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:04,872
[groans]
Not today.

207
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:09,168
I don't get it.
They robbed us.

208
00:11:09,251 --> 00:11:11,295
-[Wolf grunting]
-[Kipo sighs]

209
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:13,547
But they also tried to help us.

210
00:11:14,924 --> 00:11:17,176
Something about this just feels wrong.

211
00:11:17,259 --> 00:11:19,095
[screaming]

212
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:20,221
Get away!

213
00:11:20,304 --> 00:11:21,514
[squeals]

214
00:11:21,972 --> 00:11:23,516
[yelling, grunting]

215
00:11:23,599 --> 00:11:24,850
[squeals]

216
00:11:27,853 --> 00:11:29,063
[squealing]

217
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:36,028
Wolf, I've decided.
We're going back for Benson and Dave.

218
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:38,948
Up here you do what you have to,
and we have to do this.

219
00:11:39,698 --> 00:11:41,409
[panting]

220
00:11:42,493 --> 00:11:43,327
You're right.

221
00:11:43,411 --> 00:11:45,371
And I won't take no...
Wait, what?

222
00:11:45,454 --> 00:11:47,498
Those two aren't worth my spit...

223
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:53,254
[sighs]
But up here, we should stick together.

224
00:11:53,337 --> 00:11:57,007
[sighs]
You do care, even if you can't admit it.

225
00:11:57,425 --> 00:11:59,301
That's lesson one of people.

226
00:12:01,262 --> 00:12:03,305
[Wolf] You're hugging me. Don't.

227
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:05,433
[Kipo sighs] Deal with it.

228
00:12:08,352 --> 00:12:11,105
Look, we have one human.
That's pretty good.

229
00:12:11,188 --> 00:12:12,815
Let's call it a day and go home.

230
00:12:12,898 --> 00:12:16,652
Uh, I'm sorry. Pretty good?
You'd settle for pretty good,

231
00:12:16,735 --> 00:12:21,323
when we could have the burrow girl
and make the biggest score of our lives?

232
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:24,034
And you call yourself a Mod Frog.

233
00:12:24,118 --> 00:12:26,620
Also, your tie is uneven.

234
00:12:27,329 --> 00:12:28,205
[gasps]

235
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:30,458
-[scoffs]
-[hums]

236
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:33,085
Man, that wolf girl.
It really burns me.

237
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:36,964
She could've helped us, and these ropes
are really cuttin' off my circulation.

238
00:12:37,047 --> 00:12:38,841
To be fair, we did take her deathstalker.

239
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:42,011
So? Everyone steals.
That's just survival.

240
00:12:42,094 --> 00:12:44,805
But turning her back on us like that
goes against the code.

241
00:12:44,889 --> 00:12:46,515
We... We have a code?

242
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:48,517
The unwritten code
that we never speak about.

243
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:50,895
We both live by it.
I thought you knew!

244
00:12:50,978 --> 00:12:53,522
Anything in that code
about untying knots?

245
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:54,440
Hang on.

246
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:55,691
Huh?

247
00:12:56,859 --> 00:12:58,527
[grunting]

248
00:13:01,155 --> 00:13:02,281
[tires screeching]

249
00:13:02,364 --> 00:13:03,741
[groaning]

250
00:13:03,824 --> 00:13:05,701
[sighs] Oh, yeah.

251
00:13:05,784 --> 00:13:09,538
The boss is gonna be so happy
when we show her what we just found.

252
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:12,583
-The burrow girl!
-I hate to disappoint you.

253
00:13:12,666 --> 00:13:15,544
You're gonna give us our two friends,
and then we'll be on our way.

254
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:17,463
You heard her.
Hand them over.

255
00:13:17,546 --> 00:13:21,008
Harris, Kwat, they want us
to hand over their friends.

256
00:13:21,091 --> 00:13:23,302
I think that's against company policy.

257
00:13:23,385 --> 00:13:25,387
My coworker's a real stickler
for the rules.

258
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:28,724
Look, I totally get it.
You all want to be together.

259
00:13:28,849 --> 00:13:31,018
So, I'll take all four of you.

260
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:36,398
[grunts]

261
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:43,781
[slow-motion growl]

262
00:13:43,989 --> 00:13:45,074
-[grunts]
-[car door shuts]

263
00:13:45,157 --> 00:13:47,243
Welp, there goes our last hope of rescue.

264
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:49,078
Next time, we pick smarter humans to rob.

265
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:49,995
[chuckles nervously]

266
00:14:01,131 --> 00:14:03,050
I'm telling you, she smells awful.

267
00:14:03,133 --> 00:14:04,051
[grunts]

268
00:14:04,385 --> 00:14:06,136
Humans have no sense of hygiene.

269
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:07,388
[laughs] No.

270
00:14:07,471 --> 00:14:09,765
That's just the smell
of how stinkin' rich

271
00:14:09,848 --> 00:14:14,186
we're all about to be
because we have a burrow girl!

272
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:16,814
That's right.
If you ever wanted to see one...

273
00:14:16,897 --> 00:14:19,942
-[all gasping]
-...in person, now's your chance.

274
00:14:20,401 --> 00:14:23,237
We have a burrow girl!

275
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,530
-[chuckles nervously]
-[grunts]

276
00:14:24,613 --> 00:14:27,575
Uh, whoever said I'm from a burrow...
[chuckles nervously]

277
00:14:27,658 --> 00:14:30,119
I hunt mega bunnies.
Mm-hmm.

278
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:33,998
I've been on the surface my whole life...
[gruff voice] just surviving.

279
00:14:34,081 --> 00:14:35,583
Just don't.

280
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:36,959
Huh.

281
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:39,461
Yeah, it's obvious she's a burrow girl.

282
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:41,213
But I'd rather have proof.

283
00:14:41,297 --> 00:14:44,174
If you can confirm it, you both go free.

284
00:14:45,175 --> 00:14:46,218
Who, Kipo?

285
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:49,305
My girl here is the baddest
mega-bunny hunter ever.

286
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:50,556
Yeah, she's a legend.

287
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:53,100
Apology accepted, girl.

288
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:55,644
Did it look like I apologized?

289
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:57,271
Boss!

290
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:02,067
-You're back. I have a--
-So, this is her?

291
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:04,069
A gift for you.

292
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:08,782
[groans]

293
00:15:08,866 --> 00:15:11,493
Skin untouched by the sun.

294
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:12,494
[groaning]

295
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:14,622
Not a single tooth missing.

296
00:15:14,705 --> 00:15:18,083
Well done, Jamack.
This girl is from a burrow.

297
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:20,669
Scarlemagne will pay handsomely for her.

298
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:23,172
Wait. What now?
Did she say who I think she said?

299
00:15:23,255 --> 00:15:26,133
Scarlemagne?
Who's Scarlemagne?

300
00:15:26,216 --> 00:15:28,218
Trust me.
You don't want to know.

301
00:15:28,302 --> 00:15:29,470
[rumbling]

302
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:32,848
[sniffs]
Something smells funny.

303
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:34,433
Oh, that?

304
00:15:34,516 --> 00:15:37,686
It's like we've been saying all along,
we're mega bunny hunters.

305
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:39,355
And right before Jamack grabbed us...

306
00:15:42,232 --> 00:15:43,943
we found a nest of babies.

307
00:15:44,026 --> 00:15:46,487
Their fur is so soft.

308
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:47,696
[gasps]

309
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:49,323
[roars]

310
00:15:49,406 --> 00:15:50,449
[sniffs]

311
00:15:50,532 --> 00:15:53,661
-Jamack!
-That was the signal!

312
00:15:53,744 --> 00:15:56,664
-Where's our backup?
-Mandu, you're the backup!

313
00:15:58,874 --> 00:16:01,043
[slow-motion yelling]

314
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:06,715
[shrieking]

315
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:08,425
[gasping]

316
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:10,469
[screaming]

317
00:16:10,552 --> 00:16:12,680
We gotta move, or we'll be bunny chow!

318
00:16:12,763 --> 00:16:14,390
Like, now!

319
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:16,183
[growling]

320
00:16:16,266 --> 00:16:18,644
You enraged a 100-foot-tall
mom beast on purpose.

321
00:16:18,727 --> 00:16:19,812
What was your plan for after that?

322
00:16:19,895 --> 00:16:22,106
I never thought that far ahead.
I'm new at this.

323
00:16:22,189 --> 00:16:24,233
Know what?
We'd have done the same.

324
00:16:24,358 --> 00:16:25,818
-Look out!
-Human scum!

325
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:28,821
You played me!
Actually, I'm impressed.

326
00:16:29,738 --> 00:16:31,281

327
00:16:31,448 --> 00:16:33,033

328
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:37,705
Hang on!
I speak a little dragonfly.

00:16:42,292 --> 00:16:44,545
-All right, hop on.
-My man!

332
00:16:44,628 --> 00:16:45,879
[grunting]

333
00:16:45,963 --> 00:16:47,965
-[speaking Dragonfly]
-What do you mean, "Not her"?

334
00:16:48,048 --> 00:16:49,425
Uh, Dave!

335
00:16:50,342 --> 00:16:52,261
[sniffs, growls]

336
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:54,471
[speaking Dragonfly]

337
00:16:55,639 --> 00:16:56,598
[Dave] He says he'll do it.

338
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:58,434
[yelling]

339
00:17:01,937 --> 00:17:05,482
Guys, what's faster,
a bunny or a frog?

340
00:17:06,191 --> 00:17:07,109
Burrow girl!

341
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:11,613
There's only one way to shake him!

342
00:17:12,072 --> 00:17:14,742
Time to put your money
where your mouth is, bug boy.

343
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,870
[both] Skyscraper Ridge.

344
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:20,164
-King of Pop?
-No. Old-school hip-hop.

345
00:17:20,247 --> 00:17:22,124
Wait, I've got the perfect song.

346
00:17:22,624 --> 00:17:23,792
[music playing]

347
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:26,795
See, this right here is why
you need experienced guides, OK?

348
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:32,968
-We'll take the Eastern Spur.
-We'll take the North Summit!

349
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:34,094
-Eastern Spur?
-North Summit?

350
00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:35,387
Uh, guys...

351
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:38,098
[all screaming]

352
00:17:44,146 --> 00:17:46,356
Burrow girl!

353
00:17:48,275 --> 00:17:50,069
Go left!
Go right!

354
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:51,612
OK, go right again!

355
00:17:51,695 --> 00:17:53,947
Go up! Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Go up, go up, go up!

356
00:17:54,031 --> 00:17:56,575
Right! Left! Uh, up!

357
00:17:56,658 --> 00:17:58,410
How is he still on our tail?!

358
00:17:58,494 --> 00:18:00,370
[grunting]

359
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:07,252
[yells]
Incoming!

360
00:18:08,253 --> 00:18:10,047
[all screaming]

361
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:13,884
We're close to it, aren't we?
Your home?

362
00:18:13,967 --> 00:18:16,095
Ahh, I can already tell from your face.

363
00:18:16,178 --> 00:18:18,764
So, let's make this easy.
Just point me in the direction.

364
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:23,143
OK, I'll sweeten the offer.

365
00:18:23,227 --> 00:18:27,189
You go free, and your people
never learn it was you who betrayed them.

366
00:18:30,567 --> 00:18:31,985
[laughs]

367
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:35,531
You need to do some soul searching.

368
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:37,574
Huh?

369
00:18:37,658 --> 00:18:38,784
[stammers]
What?

370
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:40,953
[screaming]

371
00:18:41,495 --> 00:18:42,746
[Kipo screaming]

372
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:47,835
Whoo-hoo!
That was cold, Kipo. Respect!

373
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:52,589
Don't wrinkle the suit!
[screams]

374
00:19:10,357 --> 00:19:11,275
[grunts]

375
00:19:12,609 --> 00:19:15,112
[grunting]

376
00:19:20,284 --> 00:19:22,411
That probably would've been helpful,
like, five minutes ago.

377
00:19:22,494 --> 00:19:25,330
Anyone need a jar opened?
I got you covered.

378
00:19:25,414 --> 00:19:27,666
Just so you know,
no one in my burrow

379
00:19:27,749 --> 00:19:31,587
has ever seen a mute before...
besides a giant worm.

380
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:32,588
[snorts]

381
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:34,214
But they'll get used to you pretty quick.

382
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:37,593
[chuckles] Wait a minute.
You're inviting us down there?

383
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:39,136
Yeah. Don't you wanna come?

384
00:19:39,219 --> 00:19:40,721
You always have a warm meal.

385
00:19:40,804 --> 00:19:42,890
You don't have to sleep
with one eye open.

386
00:19:42,973 --> 00:19:45,809
-Sign us up!
-Bye-bye, surface! I won't miss you!

387
00:19:45,893 --> 00:19:48,353
[Kipo] Everyone's probably still
cleaning up from the attack.

388
00:19:48,437 --> 00:19:50,898
Wait till I tell my father
about the mutes we saw!

389
00:19:58,614 --> 00:19:59,781
Where are you going?!

390
00:20:00,073 --> 00:20:03,577
I promised to get you home.
I never said I'd be your roommate.

391
00:20:06,413 --> 00:20:08,624
So, you're just gonna leave?

392
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:10,417
I'm a lone wolf!

393
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:12,211
Uh...

394
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:14,296
[groans]

395
00:20:15,923 --> 00:20:18,425
[groans]
Come on. We're almost home.

396
00:20:19,801 --> 00:20:21,637
[panting]

397
00:20:23,263 --> 00:20:24,765
[grunting]

398
00:20:26,975 --> 00:20:28,101
[gasps]

399
00:20:29,853 --> 00:20:30,896
[sighs]

400
00:20:36,401 --> 00:20:39,488
Kipo, I'm really sorry.

401
00:20:43,367 --> 00:20:44,368
[grunts]

402
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:52,292
[squeals]

403
00:20:52,668 --> 00:20:55,379
Man, I knew this was too good to be true.

404
00:20:55,462 --> 00:20:59,174
Uh, I see a lot of broken stuff,
but no signs of any people.

405
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:02,594
[gasps]
No signs of any people.

406
00:21:03,428 --> 00:21:06,390
Are you sure you didn't live alone, Kipo?
I will not judge, OK?

407
00:21:06,473 --> 00:21:07,349
[Kipo grunts]

408
00:21:08,183 --> 00:21:09,851
I feel like we should follow her.

409
00:21:09,935 --> 00:21:12,771
-[beeping]
-[door whirs]

410
00:21:17,234 --> 00:21:18,902
Benson, you rule.

411
00:21:19,361 --> 00:21:21,071
Oh, wh... what'd I do?

412
00:21:21,154 --> 00:21:23,490
No people.
Not even in the bunker.

413
00:21:23,573 --> 00:21:26,493
That's where we're supposed to hide
if things ever get really bad.

414
00:21:26,576 --> 00:21:28,245
If no one's there, they got away.

415
00:21:28,328 --> 00:21:31,206
My father, my friends...
they got away somewhere.

416
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:37,796
And if they're somewhere...
I can find them.

417
00:21:37,921 --> 00:21:39,256
[Wolf] You're going to need help.

418
00:21:41,717 --> 00:21:43,218
I thought you were a lone wolf.

419
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:45,429
I'm home now.
You did your job.

420
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:48,807
You're not home.
My job's not over yet.

421
00:21:53,186 --> 00:21:55,439
We'll help you, too, Kipo.
We got your back.

422
00:21:55,522 --> 00:21:57,816
Totally!
What should we do it for, Dave?

423
00:21:57,899 --> 00:21:59,526
-[squealing]
-Ow, ow, ow! OK, we'll do it...

424
00:21:59,609 --> 00:22:00,736
for, like, food.

425
00:22:00,819 --> 00:22:02,404
-[snorting]
-OK, OK, for free, for free.

426
00:22:02,487 --> 00:22:05,949
Pig, you need to be pet.
Come here. Let me give you some love.

427
00:22:06,033 --> 00:22:06,950
[squealing]

428
00:22:07,034 --> 00:22:07,993
[grunts]

429
00:22:08,076 --> 00:22:10,078
[all laughing]

430
00:22:15,625 --> 00:22:17,878
-Let go or lose the arm.
-Yes, ma'am.

431
00:22:18,253 --> 00:22:21,590
You want me to pet you.
You want this love, admit it.

432
00:22:21,757 --> 00:22:24,092
-[squealing]
-[all laughing]

433
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:25,927
-She likes you, Dave.
-[metal clanging]

434
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:26,845
Huh?

435
00:22:38,899 --> 00:22:41,068
Uh, guys?
