Hi, ladies.

-Kipo!
-Thank goodness you're safe.

10
00:00:31,281 --> 00:00:34,034
We have to leave<i> now.</i>
We're here to take you to--

11
00:00:34,117 --> 00:00:35,952
Buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh,
they know why we're here.

12
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:37,370
They saw it in the cheese.

13
00:00:37,454 --> 00:00:40,915
-Actually, we're washing dishes.
-I broke the sink!

14
00:00:40,999 --> 00:00:43,001
It's not cheese, Dave.

15
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:45,045
Yet.

16
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:47,005
Quit eating, and start packing!

17
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:50,717
[Bev] And where exactly are we going?

18
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,553
-To Timbercat Village, because we--
-Because...

19
00:00:55,013 --> 00:00:58,600
-We've built a death ivy wall to...
-Death ivy wall to...

20
00:00:59,517 --> 00:01:02,812
...protect you from the horrible killer
that Doctor Emilia just finished making!

21
00:01:04,397 --> 00:01:06,149
Do you guys even cheese anymore?

22
00:01:06,232 --> 00:01:07,275
He's right.

23
00:01:07,358 --> 00:01:10,570
Before we go anywhere,
we should look in the cheese.

24
00:01:10,653 --> 00:01:13,239
Fine.
But please hurry.

25
00:01:13,323 --> 00:01:15,158
I'm trying to save your life here.

[chanting] Feta, gouda, chÃ¨vre, fromage.

27
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:31,716
[Bev] Doctor Emilia will not waver
from ridding the surface of all mutekind.

28
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:36,095
[Ida] With her new army, she will succeed.

29
00:01:36,721 --> 00:01:38,973
[Florabel] Unless you stop them.

30
00:01:39,057 --> 00:01:41,893
You will need to fight the ones
you care about

31
00:01:41,976 --> 00:01:44,103
in order to save us all.

32
00:01:45,396 --> 00:01:46,898
[all gasp]

33
00:01:48,233 --> 00:01:51,653
Dang, really?
I gotta fight you guys?

34
00:01:51,736 --> 00:01:53,988
But to save the world...
I'll do it.

35
00:01:54,072 --> 00:01:55,740
Not you.
We meant her.

36
00:01:56,699 --> 00:01:59,077
I'm so sorry, sweetheart.

[imitates firefly speaking Bee]

44
00:02:51,546 --> 00:02:53,673
Molly! Is the perimeter secure?

45
00:02:53,756 --> 00:02:55,383
Any holes?
Any breaches?

46
00:02:55,466 --> 00:02:56,885
Did I say the right words?

47
00:02:57,427 --> 00:02:58,595
Yeah. Way to go.

48
00:02:58,678 --> 00:02:59,721
The perimeter is set.

49
00:02:59,804 --> 00:03:01,890
Our scouts have reported
no signs of Emilia.

50
00:03:01,973 --> 00:03:05,602
-Did we leave the lanai?
-Right, the welcome speech.

51
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:07,395
Hurray!
Welcome to Timbercat Village.

52
00:03:07,478 --> 00:03:09,731
It's the best place on the surface,
and you're totally gonna love it here.

53
00:03:09,814 --> 00:03:11,024
Hurray.

54
00:03:11,107 --> 00:03:12,859
Breach, breach, breach!

55
00:03:14,652 --> 00:03:17,655
Relax.
It's just us.

56
00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:20,950
Phew. I thought you were my people
and I was gonna have to fight you.

57
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:22,785
OK, everybody stand down.

58
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:24,495
Good practice!
Good practice.

59
00:03:24,579 --> 00:03:26,247
Kipo, we can finish the welcome tour.

60
00:03:26,331 --> 00:03:29,375
OK, so, over there is the place we eat.

61
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:33,463
And over there is where I sleep sometimes,
but I'm not supposed to. [chuckles]

62
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:37,675
And that bush right there
is where I hid all Molly's axes.

63
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:40,261
-You do know they can't see?
-And that's Zane in the cage.

64
00:03:40,345 --> 00:03:42,472
He's our prisoner.
He used to work for Emilia.

65
00:03:42,555 --> 00:03:46,017
Yeah. I tried to kill them,
but I'm reconsidering.

66
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:47,518
[Label] Here you go!

67
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:48,770
Huh?

00:03:48,853 --> 00:03:51,648

00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:55,026

71
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,154
We're working on him.

72
00:03:58,238 --> 00:04:00,782
Anyway, let me show you all
my favorite yarn ball.

Not only will you be so safe here,
but we're gonna become such great friends.

then we're out.

That "doctor" gives science a bad name.

Monster.

Don't be afraid.

81

Today is the first step
in taking back what is rightfully ours.

[fireflies speaking Bee]

85
00:04:43,616 --> 00:04:46,077
Ooh. My mom would know what you're saying,

86
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,997
but she's off getting supplies
to make the vaccine with my dad.

87
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,290
I'm fluent in Bee.

88
00:04:50,373 --> 00:04:51,958
They've said... [clears throat]

89
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:54,669
"The dragonflies have agreed
to avoid any human contact,

90
00:04:54,752 --> 00:04:57,046
so they can't fly over the wall,
my dudes."

91
00:04:57,130 --> 00:05:00,216
Excellent. That means Emilia's
got no way over the wall.

92
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:03,594
And here, we have the great hall
where we have important meetings.

93
00:05:03,678 --> 00:05:05,054
Like the one that we're interrupting.

94
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:07,682
Point is, we have enough food
and supplies to ride this out

95
00:05:07,765 --> 00:05:09,058
until the humans turn around.

96
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:10,059
For how long?

97
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:14,522
Until my mom figures out the vaccine
or my people realize we're not a threat.

98
00:05:14,605 --> 00:05:17,442
Or they get bored
and completely change their minds.

99
00:05:17,525 --> 00:05:18,985
See?
Lots of options.

100
00:05:19,068 --> 00:05:23,031
None of which end with us,
specifically me, fighting my people.

101
00:05:23,114 --> 00:05:25,700
[laughs]
Take that, prophecy.

102
00:05:26,284 --> 00:05:30,496
You're working very hard, dear.
But you can't fight destiny.

103
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:31,581
Sure I can.

104
00:05:31,664 --> 00:05:35,251
-We've helped Kipo fight destiny before.
-We'll do it again.

[meowing alarm over loudspeaker]

106
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:44,052
All right, all right!
She's here.

107
00:05:46,804 --> 00:05:47,638
What's going on?

108
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:52,518
The people from the burrow
actually did come with her?

109
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:54,479
Do you think
Mom and Dad are down there?

110
00:05:54,562 --> 00:05:56,939
-What? They'd never.
-Troy's right.

111
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:59,400
Your mom stopped us
from running with scissors.

112
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:01,402
She would never run with a crossbow.

113
00:06:01,486 --> 00:06:03,738
Regardless, all the humans...
How should I put this?

114
00:06:03,821 --> 00:06:05,031
...despise me.

115
00:06:05,114 --> 00:06:07,909
And here I am, all packaged up
in a see-through to-go box.

116
00:06:07,992 --> 00:06:09,452
So, go ahead.
Pop the top.

117
00:06:09,535 --> 00:06:11,704
Let me out so they don't kill me.
Thank you.

118
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:14,457
-Kipo, our parents did come!
-What?

119
00:06:14,624 --> 00:06:16,459
[gasps] It is them!

120
00:06:16,834 --> 00:06:18,419
And that's Mr. Filburn.

121
00:06:18,503 --> 00:06:19,921
But he's a math teacher.

122
00:06:20,004 --> 00:06:22,173
And they're heading
right for the death ivy!

123
00:06:22,256 --> 00:06:23,508
They don't realize what it is.

124
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:25,426
I have to warn them!

125
00:06:26,302 --> 00:06:29,472
Look out!
The wall is death ivy!

126
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:33,309
I think she said, "Dinner's ready."

127
00:06:33,392 --> 00:06:36,604
No. She said, "It's death ivy."

128
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:39,232
Watch this.

129
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:45,154
Why is the enemy warning us?

130
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:48,366
That's Kipo.
Kipo! Are you OK?

131
00:06:48,449 --> 00:06:49,408
Don't worry, kids.

132
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:50,827
We'll save you!

133
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:53,913
The wall goes all the way around.

134
00:06:53,996 --> 00:06:56,290
There's no way in!

135
00:06:56,374 --> 00:06:59,669
We don't wanna fight.
You should just go home!

136
00:06:59,752 --> 00:07:02,171
Don't listen to her.
She has your children.

137
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:04,590
One way or another,
we are getting through this wall.

138
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:06,217
Shall I burn it?

139
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:08,845
No, Greta!
The fumes are poisonous.

140
00:07:09,345 --> 00:07:10,555
We'll find another way.

141
00:07:14,308 --> 00:07:16,060
[chuckles] We did it.

142
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:19,772
Thank you for leaving!
Have a great day!

143
00:07:19,856 --> 00:07:22,984
It's OK, everybody.
The death ivy worked.

144
00:07:23,067 --> 00:07:25,736
I knew they wouldn't
risk their lives to cure us.

145
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:36,581
Or... maybe they would.

146
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:42,795
We came here for the protection
of the death ivy wall.

147
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:46,048
But it seems
that hypothesis was erroneous.

148
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:49,469
Yeah, what he said!
I think.

149
00:07:49,552 --> 00:07:50,970
He's saying we fight.

150
00:07:51,053 --> 00:07:53,264
The egghead and stinky cats are right.

151
00:07:53,347 --> 00:07:56,058
Yumyan would want us to fight
to protect our village!

152
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:57,935
Based on the density of the wall,

153
00:07:58,019 --> 00:07:59,729
it looks like we have
approximately two hours,

154
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:02,482
give or take seven minutes,
before they get in.

155
00:08:02,565 --> 00:08:05,693
-That wall was a terrible idea!
-Let's fight!

156
00:08:05,776 --> 00:08:06,986
We don't have to fight.

157
00:08:07,069 --> 00:08:10,198
We just have to get them in one spot.
Then we can talk to them.

158
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:14,702
-[Label] Lemme take that.
-Thanks, it was delicious.

159
00:08:14,785 --> 00:08:16,787
-Did you add something?
-I added pepper.

160
00:08:16,871 --> 00:08:19,499
-I thought you'd like a little kick.
-You're not wrong.

161
00:08:19,582 --> 00:08:22,084
The pepper kicked me right in the teeth.
Right where I like it.

162
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:23,669
You know what else gives me a kick?

163
00:08:23,753 --> 00:08:26,339
-No, what?
-A good ab workout!

164
00:08:26,422 --> 00:08:28,466
Good to know. Thanks, Label.

165
00:08:28,549 --> 00:08:29,926
What you doing, shaky head?

166
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,136
I've got it! Zane!

167
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,055
Zane talks to us

168
00:08:34,138 --> 00:08:36,682
because he's in a small space
he can't leave.

169
00:08:36,807 --> 00:08:38,809
We need to Zane my people.

170
00:08:38,893 --> 00:08:40,603
Is that Kipo for "trap"?

171
00:08:40,686 --> 00:08:43,022
That's not my word of choice, but yes.

172
00:08:43,105 --> 00:08:44,982
Why would we waste our time on that,
when the Mega Jaguar

173
00:08:45,066 --> 00:08:46,317
could just devour them?

174
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,944
First of all, ew.

175
00:08:48,027 --> 00:08:50,154
Second, traps will work.

176
00:08:50,238 --> 00:08:52,740
I knew Kipo would
come up with a smart plan.

177
00:08:52,823 --> 00:08:55,701
That plan is foolish.
They came for a fight!

178
00:08:55,785 --> 00:08:59,121
-We need to prepare.
-I dunno, traps are kind of fun.

179
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:03,167
Not wanting to fight
your people is admirable. But--

180
00:09:03,251 --> 00:09:06,712
The cheese has spoken.

181
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:08,381
And it's always right.

182
00:09:08,464 --> 00:09:10,925
I refuse to let that cheese
show me who's boss.

183
00:09:11,008 --> 00:09:14,136
That's my girl!
These prophecies are not set in stone.

184
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:17,056
But they were pretty spot-on
about the Mega Jaguar prophecy.

185
00:09:17,139 --> 00:09:19,809
Yeah, but we avoided
the scary parts last time,

186
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:21,352
and we'll do it again.

187
00:09:21,435 --> 00:09:22,728
We're with you, Kipo.

188
00:09:22,812 --> 00:09:25,815
And if you wanna do traps,
I've caught a lot of food.

189
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:27,024
[squeals]

190
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:28,359
Which I don't do anymore.

191
00:09:28,442 --> 00:09:31,404
Yeah, I used to trap Dave all the time.

192
00:09:31,487 --> 00:09:32,947
You were going to eat Dave?

193
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:35,700
What, what, what? No way!
Just to mess with him.

194
00:09:35,783 --> 00:09:37,785
You know, like a prank?

195
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:40,871
Strange.
But interesting.

196
00:09:40,955 --> 00:09:44,208
OK, team. Now, we just
have to convince all of... them.

197
00:09:44,292 --> 00:09:46,460
-Walls don't work anyway!
-We have no choice.

198
00:09:46,544 --> 00:09:49,297
No walls for timbercats!

199
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:50,339
Hey!

200
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:54,051
Kipo said we're doing traps!

201
00:09:54,135 --> 00:09:55,553
We're doing traps!

202
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:57,847
-OK.
-Yes, we're doing traps!

203
00:09:57,930 --> 00:09:59,682
I'm gonna dig a hole
and cover it with leaves,

204
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:01,642
somebody's gonna fall right into it.
Such a trap.

205
00:10:04,395 --> 00:10:05,855
[Dave laughing]

206
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:07,773
Breaker, breaker, this is Mega Jag.

207
00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:10,693
How's "Operation Rock You
Like a Hurricane?" Over.

208
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:12,320
[Jamack] Amps are in position.

209
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:15,114
Oh, man, you know, I was just thinking,
this is gonna be so good.

210
00:10:15,197 --> 00:10:18,284
This is gonna be so good!
I mean, we even have a net. Come on!

211
00:10:18,367 --> 00:10:20,995
It's, like, they'll be listening
to some music, and then boom!

212
00:10:21,078 --> 00:10:22,997
-Net! And then--
-Over.

213
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,415
Right. Totally. Sorry.

214
00:10:24,498 --> 00:10:26,709
Over.
But nets, right?

215
00:10:29,378 --> 00:10:31,213
[sniffing]

216
00:10:31,422 --> 00:10:35,426
[gasps] Oh, sweet, sweet cheese.

217
00:10:35,718 --> 00:10:36,886
[grunting]

218
00:10:39,096 --> 00:10:41,182
[cackling]

219
00:10:42,558 --> 00:10:44,810
-Prank!
-Why'd you tell her what pranks are?

220
00:10:44,894 --> 00:10:46,896
Now I look like a porcupine.

221
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:48,439
What?
Too much?

222
00:10:48,522 --> 00:10:49,607
Yep.
Maybe a little.

223
00:10:52,943 --> 00:10:56,280
First one through
gets to be the first one through.

224
00:10:56,364 --> 00:10:58,699
Not if I'm the first one through.

225
00:11:00,951 --> 00:11:02,119
[grunting]

226
00:11:03,579 --> 00:11:06,290
I admire the enthusiasm, but be careful.

227
00:11:06,374 --> 00:11:10,670
I just can't wait to get in there
and start curing every single one of them.

228
00:11:10,753 --> 00:11:13,798
The surface will finally
be safe for my daughter.

229
00:11:15,758 --> 00:11:18,135
[grunting]

230
00:11:19,887 --> 00:11:22,014
[Kipo]<i> Bad Dog. Come in, Bad Dog.</i>

231
00:11:22,098 --> 00:11:24,558
<i>Is "Operation Balloon Pop and Fall"</i>
<i>in place?</i>

232
00:11:24,642 --> 00:11:25,518
<i>Over.</i>

233
00:11:25,601 --> 00:11:27,686
[groans] Over.

234
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:29,522
[gasps, whines]

235
00:11:29,605 --> 00:11:31,816
I'll take that as a yes.
Over.

236
00:11:31,899 --> 00:11:33,526
So, you want me to paralyze them

237
00:11:33,609 --> 00:11:36,070
with abject fear
while a trap encloses them?

238
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:38,280
[laughing]

239
00:11:38,406 --> 00:11:39,573
Good plan.

240
00:11:39,657 --> 00:11:41,534
Are you sure we can trust him?
Look at his hands.

241
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:43,077
Oh.

242
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:48,332
Yes. I know we can because he promises
he won't mind control<i> anyone.</i>

243
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:50,459
At all.

244
00:11:50,876 --> 00:11:54,672
All right, no mind control, I promise.

245
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:00,511
Lead the way,<i> mon capitaine.</i>

246
00:12:00,594 --> 00:12:04,640
Perfect.
Now help me with "Operation Leafy Leaf."

247
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:06,559
[cackles]

248
00:12:07,184 --> 00:12:09,979
[Emilia] Don't forget
who we're fighting to protect.

249
00:12:10,062 --> 00:12:13,482
Our sisters, our brothers,
our parents...

250
00:12:14,024 --> 00:12:15,151
our children.

251
00:12:17,987 --> 00:12:22,032
Earl, you know nothing matters more to me
than Asher and Dahlia, but...

252
00:12:22,116 --> 00:12:24,368
Are we sure we're making
the right decision?

253
00:12:24,452 --> 00:12:27,621
I don't know.
You saw what Emilia did to that wolf kid.

254
00:12:27,705 --> 00:12:29,415
It was heartless.

255
00:12:29,498 --> 00:12:32,501
How can we trust someone
who could hurt anyone that easily?

256
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:34,044
[Hoag] Everyone, keep going!

257
00:12:37,631 --> 00:12:38,799
[Kipo] Everyone's in place?

258
00:12:38,883 --> 00:12:40,551
[Billions]<i> Balloon team, standing by.</i>

259
00:12:40,634 --> 00:12:42,428

<i>Side note, love our code name.</i>

261
00:12:44,138 --> 00:12:46,974
[Scarlemagne]<i> I'm not doing</i>
<i>a cutesy name... but I'm set.</i>

262
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:50,060
I can't believe they're all
actually working together.

263
00:12:50,144 --> 00:12:51,228
Even Scarlemagne.

264
00:12:51,312 --> 00:12:54,940
You looked destiny in the eye and said,
"Not today, destiny."

265
00:12:55,024 --> 00:12:58,068
Look who came around to realizing
the cheese can be wrong!

266
00:12:58,152 --> 00:13:01,197
Or... maybe you did exactly
what destiny wanted,

267
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,657
and now you<i> will</i>
have to fight your own people.

268
00:13:03,741 --> 00:13:06,702
Destiny is an unstoppable force.

269
00:13:06,785 --> 00:13:09,288
You think you can stop it,
but you can't.

270
00:13:09,371 --> 00:13:12,291
It stops when it wants to stop.
And it never wants to.

271
00:13:12,374 --> 00:13:13,250
[rustling]

272
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:28,349

274
00:13:46,033 --> 00:13:48,244
[Emilia] This place is rigged.
Watch your step.

275
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:50,788
Phase two.
It's go time.

276
00:13:50,871 --> 00:13:52,122
[hissing]

277
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:59,046
Remember, we're doing this
for Asher and Dahlia.

278
00:13:59,129 --> 00:14:00,923
We can't risk them getting hurt.

279
00:14:01,006 --> 00:14:01,840
Hey!

280
00:14:05,135 --> 00:14:06,136
Finally.

281
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:08,806
My muscles are getting weak
sitting in this litter box.

282
00:14:09,932 --> 00:14:10,766
Uh...

283
00:14:10,849 --> 00:14:12,768
Hello to you, too, Doctor.

284
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:16,564
Greta!

285
00:14:18,774 --> 00:14:19,900
Hi, Zane.

286
00:14:20,484 --> 00:14:21,694
Do you mind?

287
00:14:22,861 --> 00:14:24,488
No...?

288
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:28,450
Can you let me out?

289
00:14:29,034 --> 00:14:30,536
Oh. OK.

290
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:34,790

-[laughs] Net!
-Miss me?

293

[Kipo] Emilia!

294
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:56,395
We don't have to fight!

295
00:14:56,478 --> 00:14:57,938
Of course, we do.

296
00:14:58,022 --> 00:15:00,566
We'll only be safe when you
and the animals you've sided with

297
00:15:00,649 --> 00:15:02,318
are cured of that virus.

298
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:04,361
What are you talking about?

299
00:15:04,445 --> 00:15:06,697
The most dangerous part
of the surface is you.

300
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:11,577

301
00:15:13,621 --> 00:15:15,748

You don't scare me, ball.

[Kipo] HMUFA!

305
00:15:37,853 --> 00:15:39,605
Nice try, Kipo.

306
00:15:39,688 --> 00:15:41,899
Come out, come out,
wherever you are!

307
00:15:47,363 --> 00:15:49,698
You just got
"Operation Leafy Leafed."

308
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:51,200
That sounds ridiculous.

309
00:15:51,283 --> 00:15:53,702
Says the lady in a box of leafy leaves.

310
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:57,498
Now for "Operation Talk To Humans So That
They Love HMUFA As Much As I Do."

311
00:15:57,581 --> 00:15:59,541
You're really bad at code names.

312
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:02,878
I reject that criticism,
but you're entitled to your opinion.

313
00:16:07,257 --> 00:16:08,133

00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:19,728

Where are you?

318
00:16:27,444 --> 00:16:28,696
Right here, Greta.

319
00:16:32,074 --> 00:16:34,994
Wait...
Are you a bush now?

320
00:16:35,077 --> 00:16:36,870
Behind the leaves?

321
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:45,838
I knew I kept you around for a reason.

322
00:16:45,921 --> 00:16:47,047
Let's get the others out.

323
00:16:47,798 --> 00:16:49,049
Mom! Dad!

324
00:16:49,466 --> 00:16:50,300
Kids!

325
00:16:50,384 --> 00:16:53,721
We'll get you out,
but you have to hand over your crossbows.

327
00:16:59,727 --> 00:17:01,603

-Leave our kids alone!

[Molly] Are you OK?

329
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,401
Be careful.

330
00:17:07,484 --> 00:17:09,778
You saved them?

331
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:12,865
-We told you.
-They're our friends.

332
00:17:17,661 --> 00:17:20,497
So, you see, you've got things all wrong.

333
00:17:20,581 --> 00:17:23,500
Mutes like funny-face flapjacks
and live theatrical performances,

334
00:17:23,584 --> 00:17:25,002
just like the rest of us.

335
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:30,382

Do nice faces.

Kipo, slight problem.

00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:09,588
Greta is crazy strong.

She burst that yarn ball like a piÃ±ata!

342
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:14,927
It was insane!
Over.

343
00:18:40,285 --> 00:18:41,120
Brother?

344
00:18:42,704 --> 00:18:44,957
I can feel my mind fading...

00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:06,812
Wheels?

351
00:19:07,688 --> 00:19:08,522
Wheels!

352
00:19:29,209 --> 00:19:30,460
Sorry, man.

353
00:19:30,544 --> 00:19:32,796
My muscles really did get weak
in that litter box.

354
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:33,797
Ya know?

355
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:43,557
Fight it, Camille!
It's just like venom.

356
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:49,354
How could I let this happen?

357
00:19:49,438 --> 00:19:51,523
I-I-I'm so sorry, Brad!

358
00:19:51,607 --> 00:19:53,817
It's all my fault.

359
00:19:59,323 --> 00:20:02,618
Stop... hurting... my friends!

360
00:20:18,091 --> 00:20:19,301
Kipo!

361
00:20:25,432 --> 00:20:26,266
Wha--

362
00:20:32,522 --> 00:20:34,316
Why isn't this working?

363
00:20:38,695 --> 00:20:39,571
Of course.

364
00:20:40,405 --> 00:20:42,741
I used<i> your </i>DNA for the cure.

365
00:20:46,036 --> 00:20:47,162
You're immune!

366
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:51,667
Retreat!

367
00:21:04,346 --> 00:21:05,973
You did what you had to do, Kipo.

368
00:21:06,056 --> 00:21:07,224
We won!

369
00:21:08,016 --> 00:21:10,102
This... is no win.

370
00:21:21,613 --> 00:21:22,864
He's right.

371
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:27,035
If I would've just
accepted my fate from the start...

372
00:21:28,078 --> 00:21:30,163
none of this would've happened.

373
00:21:30,247 --> 00:21:34,084
I'm sorry, dear.
The cheese tried to warn you.

374
00:21:36,378 --> 00:21:39,214
I won't make the same mistake again.

375
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,260
