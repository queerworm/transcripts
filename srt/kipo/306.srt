Hi, ladies.

00:00:28,903 --> 00:00:31,197
-Kipo!
-Thank goodness you're safe.

10
00:00:31,281 --> 00:00:34,034
We have to leave<i> now.</i>
We're here to take you to--

11
00:00:34,117 --> 00:00:35,952
Buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh,
they know why we're here.

12
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:37,370
They saw it in the cheese.

13
00:00:37,454 --> 00:00:40,915
-Actually, we're washing dishes.
-I broke the sink!

14
00:00:40,999 --> 00:00:43,001
It's not cheese, Dave.

15
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:45,045
Yet.

16
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:47,005
Quit eating, and start packing!

17
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:50,717
[Bev] And where exactly are we going?

18
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,553
-To Timbercat Village, because we--
-Because...

19
00:00:55,013 --> 00:00:58,600
-We've built a death ivy wall to...
-Death ivy wall to...

20
00:00:59,517 --> 00:01:02,812
...protect you from the horrible killer
that Doctor Emilia just finished making!

21
00:01:04,397 --> 00:01:06,149
Do you guys even cheese anymore?

22
00:01:06,232 --> 00:01:07,275
He's right.

23
00:01:07,358 --> 00:01:10,570
Before we go anywhere,
we should look in the cheese.

24
00:01:10,653 --> 00:01:13,239
Fine.
But please hurry.

25
00:01:13,323 --> 00:01:15,158
I'm trying to save your life here.

26
00:01:20,246 --> 00:01:24,417
[chanting] Feta, gouda, chèvre, fromage.

27
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:31,716
[Bev] Doctor Emilia will not waver
from ridding the surface of all mutekind.

28
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:36,095
[Ida] With her new army, she will succeed.

29
00:01:36,721 --> 00:01:38,973
[Florabel] Unless you stop them.

30
00:01:39,057 --> 00:01:41,893
You will need to fight the ones
you care about

31
00:01:41,976 --> 00:01:44,103
in order to save us all.

32
00:01:45,396 --> 00:01:46,898
[all gasp]

33
00:01:48,233 --> 00:01:51,653
Dang, really?
I gotta fight you guys?

34
00:01:51,736 --> 00:01:53,988
But to save the world...
I'll do it.

35
00:01:54,072 --> 00:01:55,740
Not you.
We meant her.

36
00:01:56,699 --> 00:01:59,077
I'm so sorry, sweetheart.

[imitates firefly speaking Bee]

44
00:02:51,546 --> 00:02:53,673
Molly! Is the perimeter secure?

45
00:02:53,756 --> 00:02:55,383
Any holes?
Any breaches?

46
00:02:55,466 --> 00:02:56,885
Did I say the right words?

47
00:02:57,427 --> 00:02:58,595
Yeah. Way to go.

48
00:02:58,678 --> 00:02:59,721
The perimeter is set.

49
00:02:59,804 --> 00:03:01,890
Our scouts have reported
no signs of Emilia.

50
00:03:01,973 --> 00:03:05,602
-Did we leave the lanai?
-Right, the welcome speech.

51
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:07,395
Hurray!
Welcome to Timbercat Village.

52
00:03:07,478 --> 00:03:09,731
It's the best place on the surface,
and you're totally gonna love it here.

53
00:03:09,814 --> 00:03:11,024
Hurray.

54
00:03:11,107 --> 00:03:12,859
Breach, breach, breach!

55
00:03:14,652 --> 00:03:17,655
Relax.
It's just us.

56
00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:20,950
Phew. I thought you were my people
and I was gonna have to fight you.

57
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:22,785
OK, everybody stand down.

58
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:24,495
Good practice!
Good practice.

59
00:03:24,579 --> 00:03:26,247
Kipo, we can finish the welcome tour.

60
00:03:26,331 --> 00:03:29,375
OK, so, over there is the place we eat.

61
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:33,463
And over there is where I sleep sometimes,
but I'm not supposed to. [chuckles]

62
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:37,675
And that bush right there
is where I hid all Molly's axes.

63
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:40,261
-You do know they can't see?
-And that's Zane in the cage.

64
00:03:40,345 --> 00:03:42,472
He's our prisoner.
He used to work for Emilia.

65
00:03:42,555 --> 00:03:46,017
Yeah. I tried to kill them,
but I'm reconsidering.

66
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:47,518
[Label] Here you go!

67
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:48,770
Huh?

68
00:03:48,853 --> 00:03:51,648
An apple a day keeps the doctor away!

69
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:55,026
Thank you, Label!

70
00:03:55,109 --> 00:03:57,237
Thank<i> you </i>for saying thanks!

71
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,154
We're working on him.

72
00:03:58,238 --> 00:04:00,782
Anyway, let me show you all
my favorite yarn ball.

73
00:04:00,865 --> 00:04:03,117
[Kipo] I'm so glad you decided to come.

Not only will you be so safe here,
but we're gonna become such great friends.

75

then we're out.

00:04:14,796 --> 00:04:18,258
That "doctor" gives science a bad name.

79
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:19,676
Monster.

80
00:04:28,351 --> 00:04:29,519
Don't be afraid.

81
00:04:29,602 --> 00:04:34,148
Today is the first step
in taking back what is rightfully ours.

[fireflies speaking Bee]

85
00:04:43,616 --> 00:04:46,077
Ooh. My mom would know what you're saying,

86
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,997
but she's off getting supplies
to make the vaccine with my dad.

87
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,290
I'm fluent in Bee.

88
00:04:50,373 --> 00:04:51,958
They've said... [clears throat]

89
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:54,669
"The dragonflies have agreed
to avoid any human contact,

90
00:04:54,752 --> 00:04:57,046
so they can't fly over the wall,
my dudes."

91
00:04:57,130 --> 00:05:00,216
Excellent. That means Emilia's
got no way over the wall.

92
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:03,594
And here, we have the great hall
where we have important meetings.

93
00:05:03,678 --> 00:05:05,054
Like the one that we're interrupting.

94
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:07,682
Point is, we have enough food
and supplies to ride this out

95
00:05:07,765 --> 00:05:09,058
until the humans turn around.

96
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:10,059
For how long?

97
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:14,522
Until my mom figures out the vaccine
or my people realize we're not a threat.

98
00:05:14,605 --> 00:05:17,442
Or they get bored
and completely change their minds.

99
00:05:17,525 --> 00:05:18,985
See?
Lots of options.

100
00:05:19,068 --> 00:05:23,031
None of which end with us,
specifically me, fighting my people.

101
00:05:23,114 --> 00:05:25,700
[laughs]
Take that, prophecy.

102
00:05:26,284 --> 00:05:30,496
You're working very hard, dear.
But you can't fight destiny.

103
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:31,581
Sure I can.

104
00:05:31,664 --> 00:05:35,251
-We've helped Kipo fight destiny before.
-We'll do it again.

[meowing alarm over loudspeaker]

106
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:44,052
All right, all right!
She's here.

107
00:05:46,804 --> 00:05:47,638
What's going on?

108
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:52,518
The people from the burrow
actually did come with her?

109
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:54,479
Do you think
Mom and Dad are down there?

110
00:05:54,562 --> 00:05:56,939
-What? They'd never.
-Troy's right.

111
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:59,400
Your mom stopped us
from running with scissors.

112
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:01,402
She would never run with a crossbow.

113
00:06:01,486 --> 00:06:03,738
Regardless, all the humans...
How should I put this?

114
00:06:03,821 --> 00:06:05,031
...despise me.

115
00:06:05,114 --> 00:06:07,909
And here I am, all packaged up
in a see-through to-go box.

116
00:06:07,992 --> 00:06:09,452
So, go ahead.
Pop the top.

117
00:06:09,535 --> 00:06:11,704
Let me out so they don't kill me.
Thank you.

118
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:14,457
-Kipo, our parents did come!
-What?

119
00:06:14,624 --> 00:06:16,459
[gasps] It is them!

120
00:06:16,834 --> 00:06:18,419
And that's Mr. Filburn.

121
00:06:18,503 --> 00:06:19,921
But he's a math teacher.

122
00:06:20,004 --> 00:06:22,173
And they're heading
right for the death ivy!

123
00:06:22,256 --> 00:06:23,508
They don't realize what it is.

124
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:25,426
I have to warn them!

125
00:06:26,302 --> 00:06:29,472
Look out!
The wall is death ivy!

126
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:33,309
I think she said, "Dinner's ready."

127
00:06:33,392 --> 00:06:36,604
No. She said, "It's death ivy."

128
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:39,232
Watch this.

129
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:45,154
Why is the enemy warning us?

130
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:48,366
That's Kipo.
Kipo! Are you OK?

131
00:06:48,449 --> 00:06:49,408
Don't worry, kids.

132
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:50,827
We'll save you!

133
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:53,913
The wall goes all the way around.

134
00:06:53,996 --> 00:06:56,290
There's no way in!

135
00:06:56,374 --> 00:06:59,669
We don't wanna fight.
You should just go home!

136
00:06:59,752 --> 00:07:02,171
Don't listen to her.
She has your children.

137
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:04,590
One way or another,
we are getting through this wall.

138
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:06,217
Shall I burn it?

139
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:08,845
No, Greta!
The fumes are poisonous.

140
00:07:09,345 --> 00:07:10,555
We'll find another way.

141
00:07:14,308 --> 00:07:16,060
[chuckles] We did it.

142
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:19,772
Thank you for leaving!
Have a great day!

143
00:07:19,856 --> 00:07:22,984
It's OK, everybody.
The death ivy worked.

144
00:07:23,067 --> 00:07:25,736
I knew they wouldn't
risk their lives to cure us.

145
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:36,581
Or... maybe they would.

146
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:42,795
We came here for the protection
of the death ivy wall.

147
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:46,048
But it seems
that hypothesis was erroneous.

148
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:49,469
Yeah, what he said!
I think.

149
00:07:49,552 --> 00:07:50,970
He's saying we fight.

150
00:07:51,053 --> 00:07:53,264
The egghead and stinky cats are right.

151
00:07:53,347 --> 00:07:56,058
Yumyan would want us to fight
to protect our village!

152
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:57,935
Based on the density of the wall,

153
00:07:58,019 --> 00:07:59,729
it looks like we have
approximately two hours,

154
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:02,482
give or take seven minutes,
before they get in.

155
00:08:02,565 --> 00:08:05,693
-That wall was a terrible idea!
-Let's fight!

156
00:08:05,776 --> 00:08:06,986
We don't have to fight.

157
00:08:07,069 --> 00:08:10,198
We just have to get them in one spot.
Then we can talk to them.

158
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:14,702
-[Label] Lemme take that.
-Thanks, it was delicious.

159
00:08:14,785 --> 00:08:16,787
-Did you add something?
-I added pepper.

160
00:08:16,871 --> 00:08:19,499
-I thought you'd like a little kick.
-You're not wrong.

161
00:08:19,582 --> 00:08:22,084
The pepper kicked me right in the teeth.
Right where I like it.

162
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:23,669
You know what else gives me a kick?

163
00:08:23,753 --> 00:08:26,339
-No, what?
-A good ab workout!

164
00:08:26,422 --> 00:08:28,466
Good to know. Thanks, Label.

165
00:08:28,549 --> 00:08:29,926
What you doing, shaky head?

166
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,136
I've got it! Zane!

167
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,055
Zane talks to us

168
00:08:34,138 --> 00:08:36,682
because he's in a small space
he can't leave.

169
00:08:36,807 --> 00:08:38,809
We need to Zane my people.

170
00:08:38,893 --> 00:08:40,603
Is that Kipo for "trap"?

171
00:08:40,686 --> 00:08:43,022
That's not my word of choice, but yes.

172
00:08:43,105 --> 00:08:44,982
Why would we waste our time on that,
when the Mega Jaguar

173
00:08:45,066 --> 00:08:46,317
could just devour them?

174
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,944
First of all, ew.

175
00:08:48,027 --> 00:08:50,154
Second, traps will work.

176
00:08:50,238 --> 00:08:52,740
I knew Kipo would
come up with a smart plan.

177
00:08:52,823 --> 00:08:55,701
That plan is foolish.
They came for a fight!

178
00:08:55,785 --> 00:08:59,121
-We need to prepare.
-I dunno, traps are kind of fun.

179
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:03,167
Not wanting to fight
your people is admirable. But--

180
00:09:03,251 --> 00:09:06,712
The cheese has spoken.

181
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:08,381
And it's always right.

182
00:09:08,464 --> 00:09:10,925
I refuse to let that cheese
show me who's boss.

183
00:09:11,008 --> 00:09:14,136
That's my girl!
These prophecies are not set in stone.

184
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:17,056
But they were pretty spot-on
about the Mega Jaguar prophecy.

185
00:09:17,139 --> 00:09:19,809
Yeah, but we avoided
the scary parts last time,

186
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:21,352
and we'll do it again.

187
00:09:21,435 --> 00:09:22,728
We're with you, Kipo.

188
00:09:22,812 --> 00:09:25,815
And if you wanna do traps,
I've caught a lot of food.

189
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:27,024
[squeals]

190
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:28,359
Which I don't do anymore.

191
00:09:28,442 --> 00:09:31,404
Yeah, I used to trap Dave all the time.

192
00:09:31,487 --> 00:09:32,947
You were going to eat Dave?

193
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:35,700
What, what, what? No way!
Just to mess with him.

194
00:09:35,783 --> 00:09:37,785
You know, like a prank?

195
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:40,871
Strange.
But interesting.

196
00:09:40,955 --> 00:09:44,208
OK, team. Now, we just
have to convince all of... them.

197
00:09:44,292 --> 00:09:46,460
-Walls don't work anyway!
-We have no choice.

198
00:09:46,544 --> 00:09:49,297
No walls for timbercats!

199
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:50,339
Hey!

200
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:54,051
Kipo said we're doing traps!

201
00:09:54,135 --> 00:09:55,553
We're doing traps!

202
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:57,847
-OK.
-Yes, we're doing traps!

203
00:09:57,930 --> 00:09:59,682
I'm gonna dig a hole
and cover it with leaves,

204
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:01,642
somebody's gonna fall right into it.
Such a trap.

205
00:10:04,395 --> 00:10:05,855
[Dave laughing]

206
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:07,773
Breaker, breaker, this is Mega Jag.

207
00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:10,693
How's "Operation Rock You
Like a Hurricane?" Over.

208
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:12,320
[Jamack] Amps are in position.

209
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:15,114
Oh, man, you know, I was just thinking,
this is gonna be so good.

210
00:10:15,197 --> 00:10:18,284
This is gonna be so good!
I mean, we even have a net. Come on!

211
00:10:18,367 --> 00:10:20,995
It's, like, they'll be listening
to some music, and then boom!

212
00:10:21,078 --> 00:10:22,997
-Net! And then--
-Over.

213
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,415
Right. Totally. Sorry.

214
00:10:24,498 --> 00:10:26,709
Over.
But nets, right?

215
00:10:29,378 --> 00:10:31,213
[sniffing]

216
00:10:31,422 --> 00:10:35,426
[gasps] Oh, sweet, sweet cheese.

217
00:10:35,718 --> 00:10:36,886
[grunting]

218
00:10:39,096 --> 00:10:41,182
[cackling]

219
00:10:42,558 --> 00:10:44,810
-Prank!
-Why'd you tell her what pranks are?

220
00:10:44,894 --> 00:10:46,896
Now I look like a porcupine.

221
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:48,439
What?
Too much?

222
00:10:48,522 --> 00:10:49,607
Yep.
Maybe a little.

223
00:10:52,943 --> 00:10:56,280
First one through
gets to be the first one through.

224
00:10:56,364 --> 00:10:58,699
Not if I'm the first one through.

225
00:11:00,951 --> 00:11:02,119
[grunting]

226
00:11:03,579 --> 00:11:06,290
I admire the enthusiasm, but be careful.

227
00:11:06,374 --> 00:11:10,670
I just can't wait to get in there
and start curing every single one of them.

228
00:11:10,753 --> 00:11:13,798
The surface will finally
be safe for my daughter.

229
00:11:15,758 --> 00:11:18,135
[grunting]

230
00:11:19,887 --> 00:11:22,014
[Kipo]<i> Bad Dog. Come in, Bad Dog.</i>

231
00:11:22,098 --> 00:11:24,558
<i>Is "Operation Balloon Pop and Fall"</i>
<i>in place?</i>

232
00:11:24,642 --> 00:11:25,518
<i>Over.</i>

233
00:11:25,601 --> 00:11:27,686
[groans] Over.

234
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:29,522
[gasps, whines]

235
00:11:29,605 --> 00:11:31,816
I'll take that as a yes.
Over.

236
00:11:31,899 --> 00:11:33,526
So, you want me to paralyze them

237
00:11:33,609 --> 00:11:36,070
with abject fear
while a trap encloses them?

238
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:38,280
[laughing]

239
00:11:38,406 --> 00:11:39,573
Good plan.

240
00:11:39,657 --> 00:11:41,534
Are you sure we can trust him?
Look at his hands.

241
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:43,077
Oh.

242
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:48,332
Yes. I know we can because he promises
he won't mind control<i> anyone.</i>

243
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:50,459
At all.

244
00:11:50,876 --> 00:11:54,672
All right, no mind control, I promise.

245
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:00,511
Lead the way,<i> mon capitaine.</i>

246
00:12:00,594 --> 00:12:04,640
Perfect.
Now help me with "Operation Leafy Leaf."

247
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:06,559
[cackles]

248
00:12:07,184 --> 00:12:09,979
[Emilia] Don't forget
who we're fighting to protect.

249
00:12:10,062 --> 00:12:13,482
Our sisters, our brothers,
our parents...

250
00:12:14,024 --> 00:12:15,151
our children.

251
00:12:17,987 --> 00:12:22,032
Earl, you know nothing matters more to me
than Asher and Dahlia, but...

252
00:12:22,116 --> 00:12:24,368
Are we sure we're making
the right decision?

253
00:12:24,452 --> 00:12:27,621
I don't know.
You saw what Emilia did to that wolf kid.

254
00:12:27,705 --> 00:12:29,415
It was heartless.

255
00:12:29,498 --> 00:12:32,501
How can we trust someone
who could hurt anyone that easily?

256
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:34,044
[Hoag] Everyone, keep going!

257
00:12:37,631 --> 00:12:38,799
[Kipo] Everyone's in place?

258
00:12:38,883 --> 00:12:40,551
[Billions]<i> Balloon team, standing by.</i>

259
00:12:40,634 --> 00:12:42,428

<i>Side note, love our code name.</i>

261
00:12:44,138 --> 00:12:46,974
[Scarlemagne]<i> I'm not doing</i>
<i>a cutesy name... but I'm set.</i>

262
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:50,060
I can't believe they're all
actually working together.

263
00:12:50,144 --> 00:12:51,228
Even Scarlemagne.

264
00:12:51,312 --> 00:12:54,940
You looked destiny in the eye and said,
"Not today, destiny."

265
00:12:55,024 --> 00:12:58,068
Look who came around to realizing
the cheese can be wrong!

266
00:12:58,152 --> 00:13:01,197
Or... maybe you did exactly
what destiny wanted,

267
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,657
and now you<i> will</i>
have to fight your own people.

268
00:13:03,741 --> 00:13:06,702
Destiny is an unstoppable force.

269
00:13:06,785 --> 00:13:09,288
You think you can stop it,
but you can't.

270
00:13:09,371 --> 00:13:12,291
It stops when it wants to stop.
And it never wants to.

271
00:13:12,374 --> 00:13:13,250
[rustling]

272
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:28,349

274
00:13:46,033 --> 00:13:48,244
[Emilia] This place is rigged.
Watch your step.

275
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:50,788
Phase two.
It's go time.

276
00:13:50,871 --> 00:13:52,122
[hissing]

277
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:59,046
Remember, we're doing this
for Asher and Dahlia.

278
00:13:59,129 --> 00:14:00,923
We can't risk them getting hurt.

279
00:14:01,006 --> 00:14:01,840
Hey!

280
00:14:05,135 --> 00:14:06,136
Finally.

281
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:08,806
My muscles are getting weak
sitting in this litter box.

282
00:14:09,932 --> 00:14:10,766
Uh...

283
00:14:10,849 --> 00:14:12,768
Hello to you, too, Doctor.

284
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:16,564
Greta!

285
00:14:18,774 --> 00:14:19,900
Hi, Zane.

286
00:14:20,484 --> 00:14:21,694
Do you mind?

287
00:14:22,861 --> 00:14:24,488
No...?

288
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:28,450
Can you let me out?

289
00:14:29,034 --> 00:14:30,536
Oh. OK.

290
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:34,790
[guitar music continues]

-[laughs] Net!
-Miss me?

[Kipo] Emilia!

294
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:56,395
We don't have to fight!

295
00:14:56,478 --> 00:14:57,938
Of course, we do.

296
00:14:58,022 --> 00:15:00,566
We'll only be safe when you
and the animals you've sided with

297
00:15:00,649 --> 00:15:02,318
are cured of that virus.

298
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:04,361
What are you talking about?

299
00:15:04,445 --> 00:15:06,697
The most dangerous part
of the surface is you.

300
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:11,577

301
00:15:13,621 --> 00:15:15,748

You don't scare me, ball.

[Kipo] HMUFA!

305
00:15:37,853 --> 00:15:39,605
Nice try, Kipo.

306
00:15:39,688 --> 00:15:41,899
Come out, come out,
wherever you are!

307
00:15:47,363 --> 00:15:49,698
You just got
"Operation Leafy Leafed."

308
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:51,200
That sounds ridiculous.

309
00:15:51,283 --> 00:15:53,702
Says the lady in a box of leafy leaves.

310
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:57,498
Now for "Operation Talk To Humans So That
They Love HMUFA As Much As I Do."

311
00:15:57,581 --> 00:15:59,541
You're really bad at code names.

312
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:02,878
I reject that criticism,
but you're entitled to your opinion.

313
00:16:07,257 --> 00:16:08,133

00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:19,728

Where are you?

318
00:16:27,444 --> 00:16:28,696
Right here, Greta.

319
00:16:32,074 --> 00:16:34,994
Wait...
Are you a bush now?

320
00:16:35,077 --> 00:16:36,870
Behind the leaves?

321
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:45,838
I knew I kept you around for a reason.

322
00:16:45,921 --> 00:16:47,047
Let's get the others out.

323
00:16:47,798 --> 00:16:49,049
Mom! Dad!

324
00:16:49,466 --> 00:16:50,300
Kids!

325
00:16:50,384 --> 00:16:53,721
We'll get you out,
but you have to hand over your crossbows.

00:16:59,727 --> 00:17:01,603

[Molly] Are you OK?

329
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,401
Be careful.

330
00:17:07,484 --> 00:17:09,778
You saved them?

331
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:12,865
-We told you.
-They're our friends.

332
00:17:17,661 --> 00:17:20,497
So, you see, you've got things all wrong.

333
00:17:20,581 --> 00:17:23,500
Mutes like funny-face flapjacks
and live theatrical performances,

334
00:17:23,584 --> 00:17:25,002
just like the rest of us.

335
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:30,382

Do nice faces.

Kipo, slight problem.

Greta is crazy strong.

341
00:18:09,671 --> 00:18:11,840
She burst that yarn ball like a piñata!

342
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:14,927
It was insane!
Over.

343
00:18:40,285 --> 00:18:41,120
Brother?

344
00:18:42,704 --> 00:18:44,957
I can feel my mind fading...

345
00:18:45,582 --> 00:18:48,043

00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:06,812
Wheels?

351
00:19:07,688 --> 00:19:08,522
Wheels!

352
00:19:29,209 --> 00:19:30,460
Sorry, man.

353
00:19:30,544 --> 00:19:32,796
My muscles really did get weak
in that litter box.

354
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:33,797
Ya know?

355
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:43,557
Fight it, Camille!
It's just like venom.

356
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:49,354
How could I let this happen?

357
00:19:49,438 --> 00:19:51,523
I-I-I'm so sorry, Brad!

358
00:19:51,607 --> 00:19:53,817
It's all my fault.

359
00:19:59,323 --> 00:20:02,618
Stop... hurting... my friends!

360
00:20:18,091 --> 00:20:19,301
Kipo!

361
00:20:25,432 --> 00:20:26,266
Wha--

362
00:20:32,522 --> 00:20:34,316
Why isn't this working?

363
00:20:38,695 --> 00:20:39,571
Of course.

364
00:20:40,405 --> 00:20:42,741
I used<i> your </i>DNA for the cure.

365
00:20:46,036 --> 00:20:47,162
You're immune!

366
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:51,667
Retreat!

367
00:21:04,346 --> 00:21:05,973
You did what you had to do, Kipo.

368
00:21:06,056 --> 00:21:07,224
We won!

369
00:21:08,016 --> 00:21:10,102
This... is no win.

370
00:21:21,613 --> 00:21:22,864
He's right.

371
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:27,035
If I would've just
accepted my fate from the start...

372
00:21:28,078 --> 00:21:30,163
none of this would've happened.

373
00:21:30,247 --> 00:21:34,084
I'm sorry, dear.
The cheese tried to warn you.

374
00:21:36,378 --> 00:21:39,214
I won't make the same mistake again.

375
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,260
