-No signs of mutation, yet.

I want him on two, three formulas a day.

13
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:48,840
We will be the ones who learn
what made the animals mutate.

14
00:00:48,923 --> 00:00:52,218
And then we will fix them.
Understood?

15

Guess I've gotta give you
some more formula, Hugo.

-I guess we should tell Emilia.
-Should we?

32
00:02:12,215 --> 00:02:16,010
[Emilia] We'll reach Scarlemagne's palace
from the tunnels underneath.

33
00:02:16,094 --> 00:02:17,804
This is where we'll lead the humans out

while Kipo fights off the Mega Monkey,
I'm pointing to no one.

35

Where's Kipo?

36
00:02:23,434 --> 00:02:26,437
She's been asleep all day.
[chuckles]

37
00:02:26,521 --> 00:02:29,524
Transforming into a giant jaguar
is pretty exhausting.

38

Fine, you can catch her up later.

39
00:02:31,568 --> 00:02:33,486
Now, all we need
is someone to steal a nectar bomb

40
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:37,157
from under Scarlemagne's palace,
so we can blow the tunnels behind us.

41
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:40,160
We'll do it!
We're great at sneaking around.

42
00:02:40,243 --> 00:02:42,412
Yeah.
We're small and fast!

43
00:02:42,495 --> 00:02:44,038
And I'm very likeable.

44
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:50,587
Kipo said she would be back by now.
She definitely got captured.

45
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:52,672
Yeah, that's why
we're getting the nectar bomb.

46
00:02:52,755 --> 00:02:55,425
-So we can find Kipo, and--
-Shh, shut up for a sec,

47
00:02:55,508 --> 00:02:58,261
those nectar bombs are right under
Scarlemagne's palace!

48
00:02:58,344 --> 00:03:00,346
[gasps]
We can break Kipo out,

49
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:02,724
then stop somewhere for dinner
on the way back!

50
00:03:02,807 --> 00:03:06,561
-Emilia's none the wiser.
-Uh... Yeah, Dave.

51
00:03:06,644 --> 00:03:09,105
Everything but the dinner part
was already the plan.

52
00:03:09,188 --> 00:03:11,316
So, you're saying
I made the plan even better.

53
00:03:11,399 --> 00:03:14,152
Hopefully, Mandu can keep Dr. Emilia
from getting suspicious.

how long I've waited for this.

It's gonna be all right.

OK, tell me.

66
00:03:43,473 --> 00:03:45,975
So, uh, wait, you want me to tell you?

67
00:03:46,476 --> 00:03:47,560

00:03:48,186 --> 00:03:50,813
It's lovely.
And poofy.

To be honest, I thought I'd be locked
in a spooky dungeon eating dirt.

Now that we have all the nasties

for our little soiree.

of the total authority of Scarlemagne.

Well, tell her!
No, don't tell her.

No. Not... not for a long time.

92
00:05:10,101 --> 00:05:11,686
Maybe I could be the king.

93
00:05:11,769 --> 00:05:16,149
And I'll throw big parties
and wear beautiful habiliments.

That means clothes.

00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:19,610

with no walls to contain us!

You guys were leaping behind crates

and I didn't want them to see that
I had the nectar bomb, so, I kinda ate it.

You can't lock him in a cage!
He's a person!

He's an animal, Lio.

00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:35,801
The future of the human race
is on the line.

183

So, think like a scientist
and stop getting so attached.

I trust you won't need
any more convincing.

about that Mega Monkey.

Song's pregnancy had side effects.

Dr. Emilia turned her into a weapon.

What are you doing?

347
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:15,005
-I'm hugging you.
-Why?

348
00:20:15,088 --> 00:20:16,340
Because you need it.

349
00:20:21,428 --> 00:20:22,930
Man, that was tense.

350
00:20:23,013 --> 00:20:24,389
[stomach rumbling]

351
00:20:24,473 --> 00:20:25,849
Dave, what was that?

352
00:20:25,933 --> 00:20:30,270
OK, it is possible that this
explosive nectar is upsetting my stomach.

353
00:20:30,354 --> 00:20:31,188
[gasps]

354
00:20:31,271 --> 00:20:32,481
Run!

355
00:20:34,024 --> 00:20:37,277
Dave, no!
Stop following us!

356
00:20:37,361 --> 00:20:38,654
Oh, oops!

357
00:20:39,154 --> 00:20:39,988
My bad.

358
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:41,615
Take cover!

359
00:20:41,698 --> 00:20:42,991
[explosion]

360
00:20:44,576 --> 00:20:45,786
[sneezes]

361
00:20:45,869 --> 00:20:48,705
Oh, I think I'm allergic to this stuff.

362
00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:50,332
[sneezes]

363
00:20:50,415 --> 00:20:51,708
[sneezes]

364
00:20:51,792 --> 00:20:53,293
[sneezes]

365
00:20:54,795 --> 00:20:55,754
Bless you.

366
00:20:57,464 --> 00:20:58,715
What are you nerds waiting for?

367
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:00,968
Scarlemagne's palace is this way.

368
00:21:01,051 --> 00:21:02,678
[sneezes]

369
00:21:07,307 --> 00:21:08,267
Dad?

370
00:21:10,894 --> 00:21:15,107
He's right.
All of this is my fault.

371
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:18,235
-You must hate me.
-Of course not.

372
00:21:22,155 --> 00:21:25,117
-No more secrets?
-No more secrets.

373
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,576
[explosion]

374
00:21:28,537 --> 00:21:30,706
[all coughing]

375
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:32,624
Are you sure
that was only one drop of nectar?

376
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:35,335
Whoa, that stuff was inside me.

377
00:21:35,419 --> 00:21:37,963
Let's find the secret prison
and blow the doors off the place.

378
00:21:38,046 --> 00:21:39,256
Found her.

379
00:21:40,048 --> 00:21:41,091
Hey.

380
00:21:42,259 --> 00:21:43,802
[music playing]
