You haven't talked in a while, huh?

I'm here to be your new brain roomie

Kipo picked it out.

Oh, Kipo sure is a special one,

I called in a favor from a friend.

I poured Mulholland

You can't control the humans!

Does that thing really expect us
to trust it after it destroyed our home?!

00:04:58,464 --> 00:05:00,216
Fine.
You can stay here.

But for everyone else that
wants their freedom, get in!

Snap him out of it, Mulholland!

77
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,188
Oh. Real quick, your mom wanted me
to tell you that she loves you.

78
00:05:14,272 --> 00:05:17,567
Aww.
Wait, she actually talked to you?

79
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:18,985
Do you think we can get her out of there?

Don't worry about me.
