172
00:10:47,855 --> 00:10:49,607
-Here it is!
-Don't go in!

173
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:53,110
This place is haunted!
-Dave, what did I just tell you?

174
00:10:53,194 --> 00:10:56,447
Don't mind him.
Sometimes old man Dave is pretty paranoid.

175
00:10:56,864 --> 00:10:59,575
-Bye-bye, fun Dave.
-We're going in.

176
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:01,077
I think I know the code.

177
00:11:02,703 --> 00:11:04,288
[groans]

178
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:05,956
Everyone OK?

179
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,625
[whimpers]

180
00:11:08,042 --> 00:11:11,087
[inhales]
Good. My bones are like steel.

181
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:14,298
I hurt my toe.
But that happened before we crashed.

182
00:11:14,382 --> 00:11:16,092
[high-pitched ringing]

183
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:17,259
[whimpers]

184
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:18,886
You know the rules.

185
00:11:18,969 --> 00:11:22,306
No one goes through
Umlaut Snake territory without permission.

186
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:26,018
That includes Umlaut air space, man!

187
00:11:26,102 --> 00:11:28,104
[high-pitched ringing]

188
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:31,607
It's loud but it isn't that bad.

189
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:33,984
Mute hearing is more sensitive than ours.

190
00:11:34,068 --> 00:11:35,486
[guitar melody playing]

191
00:11:35,569 --> 00:11:37,655
Ohh! I like this song now!

192
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:40,991
[squawking]

193
00:11:41,242 --> 00:11:42,284
[yells]

194
00:11:47,081 --> 00:11:49,750
Nobles, take them out!

195
00:11:55,005 --> 00:11:56,715
Why isn't it working?

196
00:11:59,593 --> 00:12:00,553
[gasps]

197
00:12:00,636 --> 00:12:02,680
[squawking]

198
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:07,184
You'll regret getting in my way.

199
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:08,727
[squawking]

200
00:12:10,187 --> 00:12:11,647
[hissing]

201
00:12:14,275 --> 00:12:15,401
Wow.

202
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:16,569
So...

203
00:12:17,319 --> 00:12:19,321
This is where my parents lived.

204
00:12:21,615 --> 00:12:23,742
Know what else lived here?
A ghost!

205
00:12:23,826 --> 00:12:26,829
-And it hates cleaning!
-Yup. Ghosts.

206
00:12:26,912 --> 00:12:28,497
Notoriously messy.

207
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:30,958
You weren't kidding
about that paranoid thing.

208
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:34,587
[gasps]

209
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:38,090
Oh, the spirits are mad
we've invaded their space!

210
00:12:38,174 --> 00:12:40,509
We need to leave now!
Everybody follow me!

211
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:42,470
[muttering]

212
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:45,264
[sighs]
He'll be back.

213
00:12:45,764 --> 00:12:48,476
It looks like a lot
of your parents' stuff is still here.

214
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:51,479
I know! It's like they totally
jumped on this bed!

215
00:12:51,562 --> 00:12:54,106
Yeah, and I bet they stabbed food
with these knives.

216
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:56,984
Right?
Oh, I can see it now!

217
00:12:57,067 --> 00:12:59,028
[as Lio]
Song! Dinner's ready!

218
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:03,491
[as Song] Coming, Lio!
I'm almost finished doing math for fun!

219
00:13:03,574 --> 00:13:05,326
[as Lio]
You're always doing math for fun!

220
00:13:05,409 --> 00:13:07,828
[as Song]
Yeah! 'Cause it's fun!

221
00:13:07,912 --> 00:13:09,288
[as Kipo]
That's not what they sounded like.

222
00:13:09,371 --> 00:13:11,707
-I'm just bad at voices.
-I bet this was yours.

223
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:16,712
Aw, it's so little!

224
00:13:16,795 --> 00:13:19,715
I can't believe I was ever this small!

225
00:13:20,007 --> 00:13:21,425
Mmm.

226
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:24,762
Not getting that anchor type
of feeling the goats told me about.

227
00:13:24,845 --> 00:13:26,639
But I'm keeping it.

228
00:13:26,722 --> 00:13:28,891
[snorting]

229
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:31,727
Aw, thanks, Mandu!

230
00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:35,523
Definitely not my anchor,
but super useful for later!

231
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:37,775
[squeals]

232
00:13:44,031 --> 00:13:45,783
They also had this?!

233
00:13:45,866 --> 00:13:48,369
I thought this was just a thing
with me and my dad,

234
00:13:48,452 --> 00:13:50,579
but I guess my mom loved the stars, too!

235
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:52,414
[squeals]

236
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:55,251
Wait a minute.
Something's off.

237
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:58,045
The Leo constellation has an extra star,
right there.

238
00:13:58,128 --> 00:13:59,922
It's not like my dad to get it wrong.

239
00:14:00,005 --> 00:14:01,882
Or maybe...

240
00:14:02,925 --> 00:14:04,093
[grunts]

241
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:07,137
[exclaims]
Secret panel!

242
00:14:07,221 --> 00:14:08,556
I've always wanted one of these!

243
00:14:10,432 --> 00:14:13,561
"Project Kipo."
Oh, my gosh, that's me!

244
00:14:13,644 --> 00:14:15,229
-Really?
-Well, read it!

245
00:14:16,605 --> 00:14:17,856
Ooh, formulas!

246
00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:23,862
Uh, but I can read those later,
when I want to treat myself.

247
00:14:23,946 --> 00:14:27,950
Here we go. "We have a new dream
for living on the surface.

248
00:14:28,075 --> 00:14:31,704
Just imagine what a human mind could do
with the powers of a Mega Mute."

249
00:14:31,787 --> 00:14:34,415
[gasps]
Mega Mute! They're talking about me!

250
00:14:34,498 --> 00:14:35,541
[both exclaim]

251
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:38,460
"We can alter the mutagen..."

252
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:39,753
[Song]
To favor the growth hormone

253
00:14:39,837 --> 00:14:43,465
and combine it with the mutagen
enhanced DNA of apex predators.

254
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:47,469
Let's start with jaguar.

255
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:53,767
Now, falcon, monkey, Komodo dragon.

256
00:14:53,851 --> 00:14:54,810
[Lio]
Giant worm?

257
00:14:55,603 --> 00:14:56,478
Worm?

258
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:58,063
I know only one of the samples will take,

259
00:14:58,147 --> 00:15:00,733
but do we really want
our kid to be a worm?

260
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:04,695
Oh, right.

261
00:15:04,778 --> 00:15:07,156
-[chuckles]
-Mm. Thank you, honey.

262
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:08,198
Yeah.

263
00:15:08,657 --> 00:15:12,912
So, one of these little guys
is going to be our baby?

264
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:16,874
[both chuckling]

265
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:23,422
I was that hybrid-baby!
Guys, I'm a living science experiment.

266
00:15:23,505 --> 00:15:25,174
Ahh!
Isn't that cool?

267
00:15:25,257 --> 00:15:26,675
Yeah...

268
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,386
So cool.

269
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:33,807
I mean, I knew my parents were smart,
but I didn't realize how smart!

270
00:15:33,891 --> 00:15:37,269
They had a crazy idea,
and they figured out how to make it work!

271
00:15:43,984 --> 00:15:46,070
Nobody followed me?

272
00:15:46,153 --> 00:15:46,987
[snorts]

273
00:15:47,071 --> 00:15:50,282
I couldn't agree more.
See, they think I'm crazy.

274
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:52,201
[snorting]

275
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:54,787
You're right.
Friends are like butterflies.

276
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:57,414
If you let 'em go
and they come back to you,

277
00:15:57,498 --> 00:16:00,751
that mean they was never
supposed to go in the get go.

278
00:16:00,834 --> 00:16:04,421
And you can love 'em forever.
I got friends like that.

279
00:16:04,505 --> 00:16:07,216
I've let some go and I kept some.

280
00:16:07,883 --> 00:16:09,009
[screams]

281
00:16:09,259 --> 00:16:11,845
-Is that Dave?
-Is it?

282
00:16:11,929 --> 00:16:14,765
[Dave]
The wall has a face!

283
00:16:14,848 --> 00:16:17,685
-Pretty sure it is.
-He probably doesn't need me though.

284
00:16:17,768 --> 00:16:20,562
[Dave]
Benson! Benson!

285
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:24,358
[sighs]
I'll go check it out.

286
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:31,699
[stutters]
There was a face in that wall!

287
00:16:31,782 --> 00:16:33,117
I swear!

288
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:39,039
Well, Mr. Wall Face is gone now. OK?
Because he never existed.

289
00:16:39,123 --> 00:16:42,376
But we haven't seen any ghosts,
so maybe you'd be safer with us.

290
00:16:42,459 --> 00:16:43,627
Back inside.

291
00:16:43,711 --> 00:16:46,130
Wall Face stared right through me,
into my soul.

292
00:16:46,213 --> 00:16:48,507
He has no soul, so he wants to eat mine.

293
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:51,218
You would think he'd be full
from eating all these other souls,

294
00:16:51,301 --> 00:16:53,512
but he keeps eating them.
They go right through him!

295
00:16:53,595 --> 00:16:56,223
You can't have my soul.
It belongs to someone else.

296
00:17:01,228 --> 00:17:02,938
I know what I'm talking about,

297
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:05,941
I've visited the spectral plane
between lives.

298
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:09,153
-No. No, you haven't.
-OK, fine.

299
00:17:09,236 --> 00:17:11,030
But I still know what I saw.

300
00:17:11,447 --> 00:17:12,990
Guys!
Listen to this!

301
00:17:13,073 --> 00:17:15,743
"Today I came home
and Lio was making dinner."

302
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:21,957
Hey, honey!

303
00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:25,419
Mm.

304
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:27,713
I hope you made enough for three.

305
00:17:27,796 --> 00:17:30,716
-Why, are we having company?
-Sort of.

306
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:33,010
More like a permanent house guest.

307
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:35,637
We're having a baby?

308
00:17:37,431 --> 00:17:39,767
[shouting] We're having a baby!

309
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:43,228
[laughs] I love you.

310
00:17:43,812 --> 00:17:45,522
I love you.

311
00:17:45,606 --> 00:17:48,358
I love everything right now!
I love these jammies!

312
00:17:48,442 --> 00:17:49,359
I love this kitchen.

313
00:17:49,443 --> 00:17:52,529
I even love the dumplings I forgot about,
and now they're burning.

314
00:17:52,613 --> 00:17:55,908
[laughs]
Oh, Lio! I love you, too.

315
00:17:55,991 --> 00:18:00,537
"We are so excited
and can't wait to meet our little Kipo."

316
00:18:00,621 --> 00:18:03,540
-[giggles]
-They loved you so much.

317
00:18:06,418 --> 00:18:08,837
Are we hugging?
Bring it in. We're hugging.

318
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:09,963
[glass shatters]

319
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:12,883
Quit haunting me, you demon spirit!

320
00:18:12,966 --> 00:18:14,718
You have no power.
You're weak!

321
00:18:15,135 --> 00:18:17,846
[sighs] Sorry, guys.

322
00:18:18,222 --> 00:18:21,558
-[sniffles]
-So, is this your anchor?

323
00:18:21,642 --> 00:18:22,893
I'm not sure.

324
00:18:22,976 --> 00:18:26,146
Maybe I just haven't gotten to the entry
that makes me go all "anchory."

325
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:27,898
OK.
Keep reading!

326
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:30,109
Dave, I need you to stop.

327
00:18:30,192 --> 00:18:32,569
-[grumbles] The ghosts don't stop!
-Dave!

328
00:18:32,653 --> 00:18:36,657
Come out and face me like a bug,
you cowardly specter!

329
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:39,159
Dude, ghosts aren't real! OK?!

330
00:18:39,243 --> 00:18:41,036
I wish you would just molt already.

331
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:44,123
Preferably into, I don't know,
a fun version of you?!

332
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:47,126
Oh, that hurts.

333
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:53,048
Guess I'll just get out your way
until I molt into someone you like.

334
00:18:54,174 --> 00:18:56,802
-Dave, I...
-[snorts]

335
00:19:12,234 --> 00:19:14,444
Hello.

336
00:19:14,736 --> 00:19:15,571
[screams]

337
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:17,739
[crying]

338
00:19:18,282 --> 00:19:21,326
My very own baby doll!

339
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:26,331
-[squeals]
-And baby piggy! Yay!

340
00:19:26,415 --> 00:19:28,667
[squealing]

341
00:19:32,796 --> 00:19:35,215
-[squawking]
-[hissing]

342
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:41,346
Get the collar.

343
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:02,159
[snoring]

344
00:20:04,536 --> 00:20:06,622
[sighs]
I did it.

345
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:08,123
I found you first.

346
00:20:08,582 --> 00:20:12,961
For the future of humanity,
I'll never let Scarlemagne have you.

347
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:15,797
-[gasps]
-What happened?

348
00:20:16,173 --> 00:20:18,592
Ah! My mom opened a jar of kimchi!

349
00:20:18,926 --> 00:20:20,761
Wow! Good for her?

350
00:20:20,844 --> 00:20:21,887
No, listen...

351
00:20:22,304 --> 00:20:25,349
I'm making kimchi and peanut butter.
You want any?

352
00:20:25,432 --> 00:20:27,517
Oh, that sounds horrible.

353
00:20:27,601 --> 00:20:30,145
But if it's what you're craving,
go for it!

354
00:20:31,813 --> 00:20:33,899
-[grunts]
-Oh... Are you OK?

355
00:20:33,982 --> 00:20:35,817
-Don't move!
-I don't know what happened!

356
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:38,654
-It was like I had super strength!
-It's OK.

357
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:40,155
We knew there could be side effects.

358
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:43,617
And super strength's not so bad!
Might come in handy.

359
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:48,664
[sighs] Earlier at the commissary,
someone bumped into my belly,

360
00:20:48,747 --> 00:20:51,708
and I'm pretty sure...
I grew fur on my arm.

361
00:20:52,292 --> 00:20:53,126
What?

362
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:54,294
-[gasps]
-[Benson and Wolf] What?!

363
00:20:54,378 --> 00:20:56,255
Super strength!
Just like me!

364
00:20:56,338 --> 00:20:57,798
Fur! Just like me!
Guys!

365
00:20:57,881 --> 00:21:01,843
This means my mom was a Mega Jaguar,
just like me!

366
00:21:02,636 --> 00:21:04,721
[all laughing]

367
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:07,516
[Benson] That's amazing!

368
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:10,352
Kimchi and peanut butter sounds gross,
but that's amazing!

369
00:21:10,435 --> 00:21:12,813
-Does that mean...?
-This is my anchor?

370
00:21:12,896 --> 00:21:15,190
I think so!
We just have to keep reading and...

371
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:16,191
[gasps]

372
00:21:17,818 --> 00:21:18,860
Whoa.

373
00:21:19,444 --> 00:21:20,320
Uh...

374
00:21:21,446 --> 00:21:23,282
Ahh... Ah!

375
00:21:23,907 --> 00:21:26,827
-What is happening?!
-I don't know.

376
00:21:27,995 --> 00:21:29,454
Ah! The journal!

377
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:31,790
-[strains]
-Kipo, no!

378
00:21:31,873 --> 00:21:33,083
Uh...

379
00:21:33,583 --> 00:21:34,668
[yelps]

380
00:21:35,419 --> 00:21:38,297
[voice giggling]
