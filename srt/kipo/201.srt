Humans had their chance.

352
00:18:51,088 --> 00:18:54,258
They ran the world into the ground
when they were on top!

353
00:18:56,260 --> 00:19:01,140
And they've been oppressing mutes
and animal kind for thousands of years!

354
00:19:01,223 --> 00:19:02,808
[wheezing]

355
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:04,726
Boo yourselves.

356
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:08,355
-Boo, humans!
-They're the worst!

357
00:19:08,438 --> 00:19:10,399
As for you two,

358
00:19:10,482 --> 00:19:15,445
turning your backs on fellow mutes
to provide humans with a safe zone?

359
00:19:16,947 --> 00:19:19,199
That, I cannot abide.

360
00:19:19,283 --> 00:19:23,662
You will serve as an example
to any mute who disobeys me.

361
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:35,674
Is that explosive nectar?

362
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:38,051
I'd run if I were you.

363
00:19:46,435 --> 00:19:49,605
Mandu, can you at least pretend like
you're not enjoying it so much?

364
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:51,148
[squeals]

365
00:19:51,231 --> 00:19:52,608
Look out!

366
00:19:52,691 --> 00:19:54,359
-[gasps]
-[grunts]

367
00:19:54,443 --> 00:19:56,195
[buzzing]

368
00:19:59,907 --> 00:20:01,325
What happened back there?

369
00:20:01,408 --> 00:20:04,536
I just charged in there
with my stupid paw.

370
00:20:04,745 --> 00:20:09,791
I was so sure I could get everybody out,
and I barely got out myself.

371
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:13,962
My dad wants me to become a Mega Jaguar
and save everyone.

372
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:18,258
How can I do that when it seems like
every instinct I have is wrong?

373
00:20:21,595 --> 00:20:23,388
That's not true.

374
00:20:23,472 --> 00:20:24,890
You were right about the Timbercats.

375
00:20:25,349 --> 00:20:28,685
<i>They took in Troy, Dahlia, and Asher.</i>
<i>No questions asked.</i>

376
00:20:28,769 --> 00:20:31,939
[Benson]<i> Your friends are safe</i>
<i>because you made the right call there.</i>

377
00:20:32,147 --> 00:20:35,108
[Dave]<i> And freeing the Mega Monkey?</i>
<i>You didn't have to do that.</i>

378
00:20:35,192 --> 00:20:36,360
<i>But you did.</i>

379
00:20:36,443 --> 00:20:37,778
[Mega Monkey sighs]

380
00:20:37,861 --> 00:20:39,863
[Dave]<i> And it was the right thing to do.</i>

381
00:20:48,372 --> 00:20:50,582
-Thanks, guys.
-[Benson] No prob.

382
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:54,044
Now, what's this you were saying
about turning into a Mega Jaguar?

383
00:20:54,169 --> 00:20:55,879
[rumbling]

384
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:05,764
[squawking]

385
00:21:05,847 --> 00:21:07,057
[Benson] Ratland.

386
00:21:14,356 --> 00:21:15,983
Those are my people.

387
00:21:36,753 --> 00:21:38,630
We have to stop him.
