00:00:06,756 --> 00:00:08,466
[snoring]

2
00:00:09,509 --> 00:00:10,635
[squeals]

3
00:00:20,395 --> 00:00:21,688
Get back here, you little thief!

4
00:00:21,771 --> 00:00:24,190
Do you have any idea how hard it is
to find chocolate around here?

5
00:00:24,274 --> 00:00:25,942
[grunts, groans]

6
00:00:28,027 --> 00:00:29,195
Stop!

7
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:30,613
[grunts]

8
00:00:31,114 --> 00:00:34,492
That is Deathstalker territory.

9
00:00:34,576 --> 00:00:36,953
[scoffs]
She's as good as gone.

10
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:39,414
And so is that chocolate.

11
00:00:41,124 --> 00:00:43,126
[panting]

12
00:00:45,712 --> 00:00:47,255
-[clattering]
-Huh? [gasps]

13
00:00:59,768 --> 00:01:01,102
[gasps]

14
00:01:01,186 --> 00:01:03,646
[heart beating]

15
00:01:12,363 --> 00:01:14,032
[yelps, pants]

16
00:01:24,501 --> 00:01:25,794
[grunts]

17
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:31,090
[hissing]

18
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:39,474
[heart beating fast]

19
00:01:39,557 --> 00:01:43,728
-[breathes deeply]
-[heart beat slows]

20
00:02:15,176 --> 00:02:16,469
[grunts]

21
00:02:17,053 --> 00:02:18,221
[yells]

22
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:37,073
[squawking]

23
00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:04,183
The fastest way to
your parents' old burrow is through there.

24
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:06,811
Deathstalker territory.

25
00:03:09,272 --> 00:03:11,608
Death makes anything
instantly more scary.

26
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:12,984
"Death Dave."

27
00:03:13,067 --> 00:03:16,362
Uh, having the word "Dave" in anything
makes it instantly less scary.

28
00:03:16,446 --> 00:03:18,573
Deathstalkers don't hunt you
by sight or smell,

29
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:20,617
they track you through your heartbeats.

30
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:23,202
If your heart races,
you're as good as dinner.

31
00:03:23,286 --> 00:03:24,913
-Got it?
-Got it.

32
00:03:24,996 --> 00:03:27,540
-[squawking]
-[all yelp]

33
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,169
We're clear!
Go, go!

34
00:03:35,381 --> 00:03:37,175
We could go through the mountains.

35
00:03:37,258 --> 00:03:40,178
It'd be safer but it would
take a couple of days.

36
00:03:40,261 --> 00:03:43,848
We don't have a couple of days!
You heard that Noble!

37
00:03:43,932 --> 00:03:46,226
Scarlemagne is forcing
all the mutes in the city

38
00:03:46,309 --> 00:03:49,687
to accept him as their emperor
at his coronation next week!

39
00:03:49,771 --> 00:03:52,232
Who do you think he's going to use
to fight the ones that resist?

40
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:56,361
-Bears.
-No! My people.

41
00:03:56,444 --> 00:03:59,572
We have to get to my parents' burrow
as fast as we can

42
00:03:59,656 --> 00:04:02,909
so I can figure out who I am,
find an anchor, turn into a Mega Jaguar,

43
00:04:02,992 --> 00:04:05,495
and save everyone before that coronation!

44
00:04:05,578 --> 00:04:07,664
[panting]

45
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:09,499
[squawking]

46
00:04:20,843 --> 00:04:24,639
-We have to lose those flamingos!
-She's right, we need a diversion.

47
00:04:24,722 --> 00:04:27,976
I know what you're thinking.
Teacup Chop-Chop, or Scoot-n-Shoot?

48
00:04:28,059 --> 00:04:30,436
No, we need something bigger.

49
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,605
-[gasps] The Flaming Phantom!
-Perfect!

50
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:34,857
Uh, what in the world
are you guys talking about?

51
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:36,234
We split up.

52
00:04:36,317 --> 00:04:39,153
Dave and I create a diversion
to distract these flamingos.

53
00:04:39,237 --> 00:04:42,448
-You get through Deathstalker territory.
-We'll catch up with you later.

54
00:04:43,324 --> 00:04:45,868
-I'm not sure.
-[chuckles] We got this!

55
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:48,162
Benson and I have lived through
some bad things.

56
00:04:48,246 --> 00:04:50,999
Kipo, they're right.
It will be impossible to calm down

57
00:04:51,082 --> 00:04:53,584
while being chased
by scorpions and flamingos.

58
00:04:53,668 --> 00:04:57,005
Splitting up is the fastest way
that doesn't definitely get us all killed.

59
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:01,050
OK, but be careful.

60
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:03,344
Ooh!
Do you still have that can of cheese?

61
00:05:03,428 --> 00:05:06,597
-Indeed I do, my friend!
-We'll use Mandu for the mustache!

62
00:05:06,681 --> 00:05:08,057
[squeals]

63
00:05:16,024 --> 00:05:19,652
-When you see an explosion--
-Two! Flaming Phantoms is two!

64
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:23,614
Sorry! Two explosions,
that means you're good to go.

65
00:05:25,742 --> 00:05:28,244
Hey, flamingos!
Over here!

66
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:30,079
-[squawking]
-[gasps]

67
00:05:38,046 --> 00:05:39,630
I guess that's our cue.

68
00:06:00,777 --> 00:06:01,778
[chuckles]

69
00:06:01,861 --> 00:06:04,614
The nectar bomb is ready,
your imperial majesty.

70
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:06,657
Ah-ah-ah, not yet.

71
00:06:06,741 --> 00:06:10,328
I am not officially your emperor
until the coronation.

72
00:06:10,411 --> 00:06:14,665
Until then you may refer to me as:
future imperial majesty,

73
00:06:14,749 --> 00:06:15,875
whom I am vastly inferior to

74
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:17,835
for I am nothing
but lowly human gutter sludge.

75
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:19,545
Go ahead, refer to me that way.

76
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:23,716
-I-I can't remember all that.
-Of course, you can't.

77
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,719
You're lowly human gutter sludge.
Step back.

78
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:28,554
All of you, step back!

79
00:06:28,638 --> 00:06:31,307
We're about to make some beautiful music.

80
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:35,228
Now where is my soprano?
I need my soprano!

81
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:42,276
Give us a high C, would you?

82
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,028
[clears throat]

83
00:06:45,113 --> 00:06:46,656
[vocalizing]

84
00:06:47,824 --> 00:06:49,784
[rumbling]

85
00:06:57,667 --> 00:06:58,835
[laughs]

86
00:07:00,128 --> 00:07:05,258
There was a time you humans waged
countless wars to attain wealth like this.

87
00:07:05,341 --> 00:07:08,010
But for two centuries
they've been sitting here

88
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:12,974
like a useless pile of bricks.
Waiting for someone like me to take them.

89
00:07:13,057 --> 00:07:16,686
Why?
Because I like shiny things.

90
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:25,278
Rescuing that many people
is gonna be tricky.

91
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:31,242
[Wolf] Kipo, about these scorpions.

92
00:07:31,325 --> 00:07:34,120
It only takes one sting
to knock you out cold.

93
00:07:34,203 --> 00:07:36,831
Then they drag you back to their lair
and prepare you for dinner.

94
00:07:36,914 --> 00:07:40,168
Nothing is immune to their venom.
Not even a mega.

95
00:07:41,419 --> 00:07:45,006
And with that, I'm gonna try and be calm.

96
00:07:47,216 --> 00:07:48,468
Somehow.

97
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:53,389
I'm gonna look at my hands.
My calm, calm hands.

98
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:57,268
-I am all serious.
-Well, your arm says otherwise.

99
00:07:57,935 --> 00:08:01,689
[gasps]
Herbs in, herbs out.

100
00:08:02,607 --> 00:08:05,234
OK, I got this, I just gotta be cool...

101
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:09,113
Inhale for four counts.
[inhales]

102
00:08:09,197 --> 00:08:12,825
Exhale for eight.
[exhales]

103
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:16,704
That's how I keep my heart rate down.

104
00:08:19,457 --> 00:08:22,919
In for four... [inhales]
Out for eight... [exhales],

105
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:26,506
-Keep your cool... now you're great.
-Everything OK?

106
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:29,217
[chuckles]
Oh, yeah. I'm rhyme timing.

107
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:32,678
In for four, out for eight,
keep your cool, now you're...

108
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:36,641
almost but not really,
hardly at all, great.

109
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:40,269
This is kinda intense, huh?
[gasps]

110
00:08:50,446 --> 00:08:52,240
[heart beating fast]

111
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:57,787
[both breathe deeply]

112
00:08:57,995 --> 00:08:59,872
[heart beat slows]

00:09:06,963 --> 00:09:08,798
-[screeching]
-[gasps]

114
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:17,306
[screams]

115
00:09:20,351 --> 00:09:22,061
[heart beating rapidly]

116
00:09:23,145 --> 00:09:24,564
-Run!
-[grunts]

117
00:09:24,647 --> 00:09:26,107
[whimpers]

118
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:32,280
I just have to say
it's taking everything I've got

119
00:09:32,363 --> 00:09:34,115
to not mute out right now!

120
00:09:35,491 --> 00:09:37,243
Herbs in, herbs out!

121
00:09:38,286 --> 00:09:39,287
Phew.

122
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:40,913
[panting]

123
00:09:46,043 --> 00:09:47,628
[screeching]

124
00:09:47,712 --> 00:09:48,713
Uh...

125
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:53,801
Careful, there's a loose rung.

126
00:09:55,303 --> 00:09:57,263
Whoa!
How did you know about that?

127
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:58,681
[strains]

128
00:09:58,764 --> 00:10:00,308
Because this used to be my home.

129
00:10:00,391 --> 00:10:01,517
[strains]

130
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:04,353
-Wipe your feet before you come in.
-Wait. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

131
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:06,522
You had a home before?
How come I never knew?

132
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:09,358
Don't get excited.
It's just a random place I found.

133
00:10:09,984 --> 00:10:11,485
Not getting excited...

134
00:10:13,529 --> 00:10:16,073
[gasps]
...by this magical place

135
00:10:16,157 --> 00:10:18,743
we should totally make
into our forever hideout!

136
00:10:19,827 --> 00:10:21,912
-Sorry.
-OK, I get that slowing down

137
00:10:21,996 --> 00:10:25,499
your heartbeat to a normal person level
will be tough for you.

138
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:27,001
But you can't make it a game.

139
00:10:27,084 --> 00:10:29,295
To get out of here alive,
you need to be serious.

140
00:10:29,378 --> 00:10:34,133
Ah! This is where you slept!
Your bed is made up of inflatable guitars!

141
00:10:34,216 --> 00:10:36,594
-You had a teddy bear?
-That's a head rest.

142
00:10:36,677 --> 00:10:39,722
Oh, I can just imagine
little Wolf over here, all like,

143
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:42,767
"These aren't toys,
they're survival tools."

144
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:45,227
I've never said that.
But that is true.

145
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:48,648
I get it, this is a jump rope.
That's survival.

146
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:52,318
-Survival of the fitness!
-It's a hand-stopper.

147
00:10:52,401 --> 00:10:54,904
-Why are you jumping in place with it?
-Hand-stopper?

148
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:56,947
[chuckles]
No way?!

149
00:10:57,031 --> 00:10:59,158
What's a hand-stopper?

150
00:11:02,119 --> 00:11:04,121
[grunting]

151
00:11:04,997 --> 00:11:07,208
Awesome!
Ah!

152
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:10,419
I haven't seen these
since my fifth grade graduation party!

153
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:12,129
I was really scared to dance

154
00:11:12,213 --> 00:11:15,508
so I played with these
the whole time instead.

155
00:11:15,591 --> 00:11:19,387
But then I learned while I was playing,
really I was dancing.

156
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:22,890
-[laughs] What are you doing?
-I'm doing devil sticks, duh!

157
00:11:22,973 --> 00:11:24,183
And dancing!

158
00:11:24,767 --> 00:11:27,603
Oh, that's what the third
fighting stick was for.

159
00:11:27,686 --> 00:11:30,648
Here, let me show you.
It's all in the wrists.

160
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:33,609
[grunting]

161
00:11:35,986 --> 00:11:37,613
That is not what I was talking about!

162
00:11:37,696 --> 00:11:40,032
You could do it with no problem
once you got the hang of it.

163
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:41,742
OK, so back to calming your heart rate--

164
00:11:41,826 --> 00:11:43,327
-[gasps]
-[yelps]

165
00:11:43,411 --> 00:11:45,121
[static rings]

166
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:47,081
This karaoke machine works!

167
00:11:47,832 --> 00:11:49,417
Ooh. Sorry.

168
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:52,086
I'm sure you're about to tell me
your super-tough Wolfie name for this.

169
00:11:53,003 --> 00:11:54,463
That is a Hoot-hoot.

170
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:56,674
-[giggles]
-Scorpions are afraid of owls.

171
00:11:56,757 --> 00:12:01,554
I use the Hoot-hoot
to make owl sounds like this: Hoot! Hoot!

172
00:12:01,637 --> 00:12:03,639
Aww.
Hoot-hoot?
