00:00:06,756 --> 00:00:08,717
[snoring]

2
00:00:09,592 --> 00:00:10,719
[squeals]

3
00:00:17,475 --> 00:00:21,229
And then, we pop in
the more concave lens.

4
00:00:21,312 --> 00:00:25,191
And boom!
A telescope worthy of Galileo himself.

5
00:00:25,275 --> 00:00:26,735
[gasps] Cool!

6
00:00:26,818 --> 00:00:28,903
Are we gonna be able to see
the fur on the glow worms tonight?

7
00:00:28,987 --> 00:00:31,781
Uh, not that close.

8
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:33,742
We would need a bigger lens.

9
00:00:33,825 --> 00:00:36,369
You know, Dad,
we're the only people I know

10
00:00:36,453 --> 00:00:38,872
who'd build a telescope inside a cave.

11
00:00:38,955 --> 00:00:40,957
Well, those other people are missing out.

12
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:43,376
There are worlds within worlds, Kipo.

13
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:44,544
[Kipo] Whoa.

14
00:00:44,794 --> 00:00:45,795
[knocking at door]

15
00:00:47,046 --> 00:00:49,716
-Kipo, are you expecting anyone?
-Nope.

16
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:54,304
[gasps]

17
00:00:55,138 --> 00:00:56,264
Kipo.

18
00:00:58,099 --> 00:00:59,100
Mom?

19
00:01:04,689 --> 00:01:06,858
[Mulholland]
What is the body?

20
00:01:06,941 --> 00:01:09,569
Just a fun car for the mind to drive.

21
00:01:09,652 --> 00:01:14,574
But if we free ourselves from our bodies,
our minds can be what they really are.

22
00:01:14,657 --> 00:01:19,287
Energy.
Pure delicious energy.

23
00:01:35,345 --> 00:01:40,600
3,260, 3,261, 3,262.

24
00:01:40,683 --> 00:01:43,228
OK, that's how many steps
we are from our starting point.

25
00:01:43,311 --> 00:01:47,440
Three-thousand two-hundred sixty-two.
Like, 3.262. A parsec.

26
00:01:47,524 --> 00:01:50,151
Let's do this.
Let's look for clues from my dad.

27
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:52,904
[growls]

28
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:59,452
OK, so, we headed south, east, west,
and now north from our starting point.

29
00:01:59,577 --> 00:02:01,121
So, now, we head back.

30
00:02:01,204 --> 00:02:03,414
That only leaves
four more directions to go,

31
00:02:03,498 --> 00:02:05,625
which is near halfway done,
which is great.

32
00:02:05,708 --> 00:02:08,586
Yeah, yeah, yeah, great.
You know what else would be great?

33
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:12,632
A frosty beverage
with a little umbrella in it.

34
00:02:12,715 --> 00:02:15,051
Wait!
Proxima Centauri!

35
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:17,595
Proxima Centauri is 1.3 parsecs
away from us.

36
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:19,556
And I turned 13.

37
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:23,017
Duh, we go toward Proxima Centauri!

38
00:02:23,726 --> 00:02:25,562
I don't have a better idea.

39
00:02:27,564 --> 00:02:30,692
-[Mandu squealing]
-Stop. Wait. Leave me alone.

40
00:02:30,775 --> 00:02:31,776
[groans]

41
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:34,445
Aw, they're playing.

42
00:02:34,529 --> 00:02:37,407
Smart move.
Using the sleeve Wolf gave you.

43
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:40,201
In case the... [whispers]
you know, fur ever pops out again.

44
00:02:40,285 --> 00:02:42,620
-Shh. It's OK.
-[laughs] Why would it grow back?

45
00:02:42,704 --> 00:02:44,455
That was just a one-time fluke, right?

46
00:02:44,539 --> 00:02:46,499
Maybe I'll keep it on, just in case.

47
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:48,793
[babbling]

48
00:02:49,377 --> 00:02:52,130
[sighs] I can't take
my eyes off you for a second.

49
00:02:52,213 --> 00:02:54,424
-[crying]
-Want some water?

50
00:02:54,507 --> 00:02:55,425
I'm thirsty, too.

51
00:02:55,508 --> 00:03:00,054
Rule number 52 of the surface:
standing water is a hard no.

52
00:03:01,055 --> 00:03:03,308
If only that drinking fountain
was working.

53
00:03:03,933 --> 00:03:04,893
[gasps]

54
00:03:05,351 --> 00:03:07,437
Whoa! That's what that's for?

55
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,688
It's safe.

56
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:11,190
Always thought those were
tiny satellite dishes.

57
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:15,403
[groaning]

58
00:03:15,486 --> 00:03:17,405
Why does this always happen to me?

59
00:03:17,488 --> 00:03:19,908
[Benson] Dave, this has literally
never happened to you.

60
00:03:21,993 --> 00:03:23,328
[squeals]

61
00:03:26,623 --> 00:03:27,999
[rumbling]

62
00:03:28,082 --> 00:03:29,292
[squeals]

63
00:03:34,088 --> 00:03:37,091
Well, this day just turned fantastic.

64
00:03:37,175 --> 00:03:38,134
Huh?

65
00:03:38,217 --> 00:03:39,052
[groans]

66
00:03:39,135 --> 00:03:42,764
-What are you?
-A co-occupier of this planet,

67
00:03:42,847 --> 00:03:44,974
just like you, my friend.

68
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:48,102
I'm a community of tardigrades.

69
00:03:48,186 --> 00:03:51,231
Water-dwelling, microscopic water bears.

70
00:03:51,314 --> 00:03:52,440
[moans]

71
00:03:53,024 --> 00:03:57,237
But you can call me Tad Mulholland.

72
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:59,906
Some have referred to me as a guru,

73
00:03:59,989 --> 00:04:02,408
although, I don't like
to think of myself that way.

74
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:07,413
I'm trained in different schools
of visualization, meditation,

75
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:09,123
warm stone massage.

76
00:04:09,374 --> 00:04:11,834
I also make a really neat
pineapple upside-down cake.

77
00:04:12,418 --> 00:04:16,130
'Cause, heck, even Mulholland
likes to mix it up a little.

78
00:04:16,214 --> 00:04:19,008
Mostly though, I’m a dream maker.

79
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:20,593
[all yawning]

80
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:21,594
A dream maker?

81
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:23,721
Everyone thinks they've got a dream.

82
00:04:23,805 --> 00:04:26,307
But most don't know how big
they're allowed to dream.

83
00:04:26,391 --> 00:04:30,311
I reveal your best, biggest,
most perfect dream to you.

84
00:04:30,395 --> 00:04:34,232
And then, I make that dream come true.
Neat, huh?

85
00:04:34,315 --> 00:04:36,150
We didn't ask for this.

86
00:04:36,234 --> 00:04:38,736
-Make it stop.
-Stop?

87
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,280
Why, we've barely begun.

88
00:04:40,363 --> 00:04:44,450
I see this more of a service we provide.
And you just drank us.

89
00:04:44,534 --> 00:04:45,910
Isn't that a surprise?

90
00:04:45,994 --> 00:04:48,037
[moans]

91
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:50,623
<i>I take my little water bear</i>
<i>friends here, and I send them,</i>

92
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:52,166
<i>just like that, into your brains.</i>

93
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:54,210
<i>And they do their thing.</i>

94
00:04:56,629 --> 00:05:00,508
<i>And I give you the special,</i>
<i>little perfect world dream you want most.</i>

95
00:05:00,591 --> 00:05:04,012
You know, when you dream biggest,
your brain has the most energy?

96
00:05:05,054 --> 00:05:07,098
Wow, that sure is something.

97
00:05:07,724 --> 00:05:11,102
To complete this journey of ours,
you become a part of me.

98
00:05:11,185 --> 00:05:15,732
[gasps] You live in a fantasy forever,
and I live off your brain energy.

99
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:18,735
Oh, wow.
That's an electric dream all right.

100
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:20,945
I can already feel it.

101
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:27,493
[sniffs]

102
00:05:32,415 --> 00:05:33,541
Now!

103
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:35,543
[rock music playing]

104
00:05:35,918 --> 00:05:37,253
[growls]

105

[panting]

106
00:05:39,213 --> 00:05:40,214
[grunts]

107
00:05:56,773 --> 00:05:58,691
We hunted the last Mega Bunny!

108
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:00,109
You and I make a great team!

109
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:01,778
Don't get all mushy on me.

110
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:08,201
Now, let's get back home before we attract
too much attention to ourselves.

111
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:20,797
I... I thought you were dead.

112
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,299
We... we both did.

113
00:06:23,382 --> 00:06:25,468
When did you get...
How did you even...

114
00:06:25,551 --> 00:06:27,470
When the Mega Bunny
tunneled into our burrow.

115
00:06:27,553 --> 00:06:30,932
I shielded you, Kipo.
You were just a baby.

116
00:06:31,015 --> 00:06:33,601
It grabbed me from behind
and took me away.

117
00:06:33,684 --> 00:06:36,020
It's no wonder
everyone thought I was dead.

118
00:06:36,104 --> 00:06:39,148
Dad, you always said
Mom got sick when I was a baby.

119
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:40,483
I was...

120
00:06:40,775 --> 00:06:42,527
I was gonna tell you when you got older.

121
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:46,197
It sounded better than,
"Your mom got eaten by a bunny?"

122
00:06:46,697 --> 00:06:49,283
I'm back now.
That's all that matters.

123
00:06:49,367 --> 00:06:51,619
I was lost for so long.

124
00:06:51,702 --> 00:06:55,581
It was the thought of you two
that kept me going all these years.

125
00:06:55,665 --> 00:06:58,459
So, welcome home.
Right?

126
00:06:58,543 --> 00:06:59,710
I get to say that?

127
00:06:59,794 --> 00:07:02,338
[chuckles]
I think you do.

128
00:07:02,421 --> 00:07:05,216
OK. Welcome home then!
I'll give you the tour.

129
00:07:05,299 --> 00:07:08,553
This is the kitchen,
which you already know.

130
00:07:08,636 --> 00:07:11,889
Oh, and, Dad and I
were just making this telescope.

131
00:07:11,973 --> 00:07:14,767
See? Even though we can't see the stars,
we can see other things

132
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:18,521
because Dad says,
"There are worlds within worlds, Kipo."

133
00:07:18,604 --> 00:07:21,899
This is my room.
Oh, you'll want to see Dad's room, too,

134
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:23,651
'cause that's where you'll sleep,
if you want.

135
00:07:23,734 --> 00:07:26,988
And this from when I guessed correctly
how many burrow beans

136
00:07:27,071 --> 00:07:28,865
were in a jar at the fair last year.

137
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:32,660
Everybody guessed, like, a hundred,
but I knew it was way more.

138
00:07:32,743 --> 00:07:33,703
[gasps]

139
00:07:34,787 --> 00:07:35,746
Don't look!

140
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:39,375
[panting]

141
00:07:41,752 --> 00:07:43,254
Something's happening to me.

142
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:48,426
[clears throat]
Kipo, something is happening to you.

143
00:07:48,843 --> 00:07:52,555
Because sometimes,
people go through changes. Right?

144
00:07:52,638 --> 00:07:57,351
Like, um, when you leave a potato out
for a few days, and it... it...

145
00:07:57,435 --> 00:08:00,438
it starts to, uh, grow fur.

146
00:08:00,521 --> 00:08:02,690
What?
I'm a furry potato?

147
00:08:03,107 --> 00:08:07,445
-I'm gonna have a little one-on-one.
-Oh, thank you so much.

148
00:08:08,863 --> 00:08:10,448
Hey, kiddo.

149
00:08:10,531 --> 00:08:14,202
You may not know
what's happening to you, but I do.

150
00:08:14,285 --> 00:08:16,037
[sniffles] You do?

151
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,455
I do.

152
00:08:17,538 --> 00:08:22,001
And I know it feels scary,
but it's actually super special.

153
00:08:22,084 --> 00:08:24,295
-It is?
-Cross my heart.

154
00:08:24,378 --> 00:08:26,380
Hair is special?

155
00:08:26,464 --> 00:08:28,132
That kind of hair is.

156
00:08:28,216 --> 00:08:31,385
Because it means you're part mute.

157
00:08:31,469 --> 00:08:34,138
Part mute?
Part mute!

158
00:08:34,222 --> 00:08:36,724
Am I gonna get angry more?
[gasps] Eat more?

159
00:08:36,807 --> 00:08:41,020
[stuttering] Will my fur set off,
like, alarms, or can I sense danger?

160
00:08:41,103 --> 00:08:44,232
Or will, uh, will people
treat me differently?

161
00:08:44,315 --> 00:08:47,527
-So many questions.
-Mom!

162
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:50,029
If you were me, you'd be panicking, too!

163
00:08:52,073 --> 00:08:53,658
You're right.

164
00:08:53,741 --> 00:08:57,620
Everything you're going through right now,
I've gone through.

165
00:08:58,162 --> 00:09:01,040
[gasps]
Whoa! You're part mute?

166
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:03,751
-You're like me!
-[chuckles] No.

167
00:09:03,834 --> 00:09:05,836
You're like me.

168
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:10,466
Your questions don't have easy answers,
but I'll help you with all of them.

169
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:12,426
That sounds really good.

00:20:12,294 --> 00:20:13,629
[both scream]

348
00:20:21,553 --> 00:20:23,347
Kipo, are you OK?

349
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:25,182
[gasps] Yeah. Where are we?

350
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:26,767
[gasps]

351
00:20:32,439 --> 00:20:33,440
[Mulholland] Wait a second.

352
00:20:34,858 --> 00:20:36,902
So, you're all happier to be here,

353
00:20:36,985 --> 00:20:39,863
instead of the perfect world
I created for you?

354
00:20:39,947 --> 00:20:40,864
-Uh-huh.
-Mm-hmm.

355
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:46,078
I was supposed to take you on a journey,
and you guys took me on one instead.

356
00:20:46,161 --> 00:20:49,248
I'm starting to think this isn't
the best way to get my nutrients.

357
00:20:49,331 --> 00:20:53,043
I'm gonna take time
to do some thinking at the mountains.

358
00:20:53,126 --> 00:20:56,755
And also at the sea.
And maybe outer space.

359
00:21:01,677 --> 00:21:04,012
Well, that's gotta be the weirdest mute
I've ever come across.

360
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:05,013
[chuckles]

361
00:21:10,435 --> 00:21:11,520
Kipo?

362
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:13,563
I need to tell you something.

363
00:21:13,647 --> 00:21:15,649
Is it about finding my dad?

364
00:21:15,732 --> 00:21:18,735
I thought I heard you say something
about that in my dream.

365
00:21:19,736 --> 00:21:22,114
When we split up
to find birthday presents...

366
00:21:22,739 --> 00:21:25,075
Dave and I found this.

367
00:21:25,158 --> 00:21:27,411
We did?
I'm so proud of us.

368
00:21:27,494 --> 00:21:28,662
-[clears throat]
-[grunts]

369
00:21:29,454 --> 00:21:32,749
There's a backup burrow?

370
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:35,460
I had no idea there was a failsafe.

371
00:21:35,544 --> 00:21:37,504
That must be where my people are headed.

372
00:21:37,587 --> 00:21:40,090
Only this says we were
going in the wrong direction.

373
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:42,259
And you knew?

374
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:47,639
-Kipo, I'm so sorry.
-My dad left me a note,

375
00:21:47,723 --> 00:21:49,474
and you hid it from me.

376
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:51,268
-I'm sorry--
-How could you?

377
00:21:55,022 --> 00:21:56,481
I was afraid of losing you!

378
00:21:57,107 --> 00:21:59,901
I was afraid because when you go
back underground, that will be it!

379
00:22:00,444 --> 00:22:03,030
All this, us, we'll be over!

380
00:22:03,113 --> 00:22:06,825
We'll go our...
our separate ways.

381
00:22:19,463 --> 00:22:21,423
[grunting]

382
00:22:22,632 --> 00:22:24,134
Oh, I remember now!

383
00:22:24,217 --> 00:22:26,136
The Parts Etcetera store!

384
00:22:26,219 --> 00:22:28,513
You should've seen
the look on Wolfie's face

385
00:22:28,597 --> 00:22:30,891
when she realized that map meant goodbye.

386
00:22:30,974 --> 00:22:32,768
I don't think she likes goodbyes.

387
00:22:33,351 --> 00:22:34,936
[Benson]
We got that, Dave.

388
00:22:36,271 --> 00:22:38,607
[giggles]
