1
00:00:06,756 --> 00:00:08,717
[snoring]

2
00:00:09,592 --> 00:00:10,719
[squeals]

3
00:00:17,475 --> 00:00:21,229
And then, we pop in
the more concave lens.

4
00:00:21,312 --> 00:00:25,191
And boom!
A telescope worthy of Galileo himself.

5
00:00:25,275 --> 00:00:26,735
[gasps] Cool!

6
00:00:26,818 --> 00:00:28,903
Are we gonna be able to see
the fur on the glow worms tonight?

7
00:00:28,987 --> 00:00:31,781
Uh, not that close.

8
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:33,742
We would need a bigger lens.

9
00:00:33,825 --> 00:00:36,369
You know, Dad,
we're the only people I know

10
00:00:36,453 --> 00:00:38,872
who'd build a telescope inside a cave.

11
00:00:38,955 --> 00:00:40,957
Well, those other people are missing out.

12
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:43,376
There are worlds within worlds, Kipo.

13
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:44,544
[Kipo] Whoa.

14
00:00:44,794 --> 00:00:45,795
[knocking at door]

15
00:00:47,046 --> 00:00:49,716
-Kipo, are you expecting anyone?
-Nope.

16
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:54,304
[gasps]

17
00:00:55,138 --> 00:00:56,264
Kipo.

18
00:00:58,099 --> 00:00:59,100
Mom?

19
00:01:04,689 --> 00:01:06,858
[Mulholland]
What is the body?

20
00:01:06,941 --> 00:01:09,569
Just a fun car for the mind to drive.

21
00:01:09,652 --> 00:01:14,574
But if we free ourselves from our bodies,
our minds can be what they really are.

22
00:01:14,657 --> 00:01:19,287
Energy.
Pure delicious energy.

23
00:01:35,345 --> 00:01:40,600
3,260, 3,261, 3,262.

24
00:01:40,683 --> 00:01:43,228
OK, that's how many steps
we are from our starting point.

25
00:01:43,311 --> 00:01:47,440
Three-thousand two-hundred sixty-two.
Like, 3.262. A parsec.

26
00:01:47,524 --> 00:01:50,151
Let's do this.
Let's look for clues from my dad.

27
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:52,904
[growls]

28
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:59,452
OK, so, we headed south, east, west,
and now north from our starting point.

29
00:01:59,577 --> 00:02:01,121
So, now, we head back.

30
00:02:01,204 --> 00:02:03,414
That only leaves
four more directions to go,

31
00:02:03,498 --> 00:02:05,625
which is near halfway done,
which is great.

32
00:02:05,708 --> 00:02:08,586
Yeah, yeah, yeah, great.
You know what else would be great?

33
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:12,632
A frosty beverage
with a little umbrella in it.

34
00:02:12,715 --> 00:02:15,051
Wait!
Proxima Centauri!

35
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:17,595
Proxima Centauri is 1.3 parsecs
away from us.

36
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:19,556
And I turned 13.

37
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:23,017
Duh, we go toward Proxima Centauri!

38
00:02:23,726 --> 00:02:25,562
I don't have a better idea.

39
00:02:27,564 --> 00:02:30,692
-[Mandu squealing]
-Stop. Wait. Leave me alone.

40
00:02:30,775 --> 00:02:31,776
[groans]

41
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:34,445
Aw, they're playing.

42
00:02:34,529 --> 00:02:37,407
Smart move.
Using the sleeve Wolf gave you.

43
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:40,201
In case the... [whispers]
you know, fur ever pops out again.

44
00:02:40,285 --> 00:02:42,620
-Shh. It's OK.
-[laughs] Why would it grow back?

45
00:02:42,704 --> 00:02:44,455
That was just a one-time fluke, right?

46
00:02:44,539 --> 00:02:46,499
Maybe I'll keep it on, just in case.

47
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:48,793
[babbling]

48
00:02:49,377 --> 00:02:52,130
[sighs] I can't take
my eyes off you for a second.

49
00:02:52,213 --> 00:02:54,424
-[crying]
-Want some water?

50
00:02:54,507 --> 00:02:55,425
I'm thirsty, too.

51
00:02:55,508 --> 00:03:00,054
Rule number 52 of the surface:
standing water is a hard no.

52
00:03:01,055 --> 00:03:03,308
If only that drinking fountain
was working.

53
00:03:03,933 --> 00:03:04,893
[gasps]

54
00:03:05,351 --> 00:03:07,437
Whoa! That's what that's for?

55
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,688
It's safe.

56
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:11,190
Always thought those were
tiny satellite dishes.

57
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:15,403
[groaning]

58
00:03:15,486 --> 00:03:17,405
Why does this always happen to me?

59
00:03:17,488 --> 00:03:19,908
[Benson] Dave, this has literally
never happened to you.

60
00:03:21,993 --> 00:03:23,328
[squeals]

61
00:03:26,623 --> 00:03:27,999
[rumbling]

62
00:03:28,082 --> 00:03:29,292
[squeals]

63
00:03:34,088 --> 00:03:37,091
Well, this day just turned fantastic.

64
00:03:37,175 --> 00:03:38,134
Huh?

65
00:03:38,217 --> 00:03:39,052
[groans]

66
00:03:39,135 --> 00:03:42,764
-What are you?
-A co-occupier of this planet,

67
00:03:42,847 --> 00:03:44,974
just like you, my friend.

68
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:48,102
I'm a community of tardigrades.

69
00:03:48,186 --> 00:03:51,231
Water-dwelling, microscopic water bears.

70
00:03:51,314 --> 00:03:52,440
[moans]

71
00:03:53,024 --> 00:03:57,237
But you can call me Tad Mulholland.

72
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:59,906
Some have referred to me as a guru,

73
00:03:59,989 --> 00:04:02,408
although, I don't like
to think of myself that way.

74
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:07,413
I'm trained in different schools
of visualization, meditation,

75
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:09,123
warm stone massage.

76
00:04:09,374 --> 00:04:11,834
I also make a really neat
pineapple upside-down cake.

77
00:04:12,418 --> 00:04:16,130
'Cause, heck, even Mulholland
likes to mix it up a little.

78
00:04:16,214 --> 00:04:19,008
Mostly though, Iâ€™m a dream maker.

79
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:20,593
[all yawning]

80
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:21,594
A dream maker?

81
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:23,721
Everyone thinks they've got a dream.

82
00:04:23,805 --> 00:04:26,307
But most don't know how big
they're allowed to dream.

83
00:04:26,391 --> 00:04:30,311
I reveal your best, biggest,
most perfect dream to you.

84
00:04:30,395 --> 00:04:34,232
And then, I make that dream come true.
Neat, huh?

85
00:04:34,315 --> 00:04:36,150
We didn't ask for this.

86
00:04:36,234 --> 00:04:38,736
-Make it stop.
-Stop?

87
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,280
Why, we've barely begun.

88
00:04:40,363 --> 00:04:44,450
I see this more of a service we provide.
And you just drank us.

89
00:04:44,534 --> 00:04:45,910
Isn't that a surprise?

90
00:04:45,994 --> 00:04:48,037
[moans]

91
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:50,623
<i>I take my little water bear</i>
<i>friends here, and I send them,</i>

92
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:52,166
<i>just like that, into your brains.</i>

93
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:54,210
<i>And they do their thing.</i>

94
00:04:56,629 --> 00:05:00,508
<i>And I give you the special,</i>
<i>little perfect world dream you want most.</i>

95
00:05:00,591 --> 00:05:04,012
You know, when you dream biggest,
your brain has the most energy?

96
00:05:05,054 --> 00:05:07,098
Wow, that sure is something.

97
00:05:07,724 --> 00:05:11,102
To complete this journey of ours,
you become a part of me.

98
00:05:11,185 --> 00:05:15,732
[gasps] You live in a fantasy forever,
and I live off your brain energy.

99
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:18,735
Oh, wow.
That's an electric dream all right.

100
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:20,945
I can already feel it.

101
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:27,493
[sniffs]

102
00:05:32,415 --> 00:05:33,541
Now!

103
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:35,543
[rock music playing]

104
00:05:35,918 --> 00:05:37,253
[growls]

105
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:39,130
[panting]

106
00:05:39,213 --> 00:05:40,214
[grunts]

107
00:05:56,773 --> 00:05:58,691
We hunted the last Mega Bunny!

108
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:00,109
You and I make a great team!

109
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:01,778
Don't get all mushy on me.

110
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:08,201
Now, let's get back home before we attract
too much attention to ourselves.

111
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:20,797
I... I thought you were dead.

112
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,299
We... we both did.

113
00:06:23,382 --> 00:06:25,468
When did you get...
How did you even...

114
00:06:25,551 --> 00:06:27,470
When the Mega Bunny
tunneled into our burrow.

115
00:06:27,553 --> 00:06:30,932
I shielded you, Kipo.
You were just a baby.

116
00:06:31,015 --> 00:06:33,601
It grabbed me from behind
and took me away.

117
00:06:33,684 --> 00:06:36,020
It's no wonder
everyone thought I was dead.

118
00:06:36,104 --> 00:06:39,148
Dad, you always said
Mom got sick when I was a baby.

119
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:40,483
I was...

120
00:06:40,775 --> 00:06:42,527
I was gonna tell you when you got older.

121
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:46,197
It sounded better than,
"Your mom got eaten by a bunny?"

122
00:06:46,697 --> 00:06:49,283
I'm back now.
That's all that matters.

123
00:06:49,367 --> 00:06:51,619
I was lost for so long.

124
00:06:51,702 --> 00:06:55,581
It was the thought of you two
that kept me going all these years.

125
00:06:55,665 --> 00:06:58,459
So, welcome home.
Right?

126
00:06:58,543 --> 00:06:59,710
I get to say that?

127
00:06:59,794 --> 00:07:02,338
[chuckles]
I think you do.

128
00:07:02,421 --> 00:07:05,216
OK. Welcome home then!
I'll give you the tour.

129
00:07:05,299 --> 00:07:08,553
This is the kitchen,
which you already know.

130
00:07:08,636 --> 00:07:11,889
Oh, and, Dad and I
were just making this telescope.

131
00:07:11,973 --> 00:07:14,767
See? Even though we can't see the stars,
we can see other things

132
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:18,521
because Dad says,
"There are worlds within worlds, Kipo."

133
00:07:18,604 --> 00:07:21,899
This is my room.
Oh, you'll want to see Dad's room, too,

134
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:23,651
'cause that's where you'll sleep,
if you want.

135
00:07:23,734 --> 00:07:26,988
And this from when I guessed correctly
how many burrow beans

136
00:07:27,071 --> 00:07:28,865
were in a jar at the fair last year.

137
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:32,660
Everybody guessed, like, a hundred,
but I knew it was way more.

138
00:07:32,743 --> 00:07:33,703
[gasps]

139
00:07:34,787 --> 00:07:35,746
Don't look!

140
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:39,375
[panting]

141
00:07:41,752 --> 00:07:43,254
Something's happening to me.

142
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:48,426
[clears throat]
Kipo, something is happening to you.

143
00:07:48,843 --> 00:07:52,555
Because sometimes,
people go through changes. Right?

144
00:07:52,638 --> 00:07:57,351
Like, um, when you leave a potato out
for a few days, and it... it...

145
00:07:57,435 --> 00:08:00,438
it starts to, uh, grow fur.

146
00:08:00,521 --> 00:08:02,690
What?
I'm a furry potato?

147
00:08:03,107 --> 00:08:07,445
-I'm gonna have a little one-on-one.
-Oh, thank you so much.

148
00:08:08,863 --> 00:08:10,448
Hey, kiddo.

149
00:08:10,531 --> 00:08:14,202
You may not know
what's happening to you, but I do.

150
00:08:14,285 --> 00:08:16,037
[sniffles] You do?

151
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,455
I do.

152
00:08:17,538 --> 00:08:22,001
And I know it feels scary,
but it's actually super special.

153
00:08:22,084 --> 00:08:24,295
-It is?
-Cross my heart.

154
00:08:24,378 --> 00:08:26,380
Hair is special?

155
00:08:26,464 --> 00:08:28,132
That kind of hair is.

156
00:08:28,216 --> 00:08:31,385
Because it means you're part mute.

157
00:08:31,469 --> 00:08:34,138
Part mute?
Part mute!

158
00:08:34,222 --> 00:08:36,724
Am I gonna get angry more?
[gasps] Eat more?

159
00:08:36,807 --> 00:08:41,020
[stuttering] Will my fur set off,
like, alarms, or can I sense danger?

160
00:08:41,103 --> 00:08:44,232
Or will, uh, will people
treat me differently?

161
00:08:44,315 --> 00:08:47,527
-So many questions.
-Mom!

162
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:50,029
If you were me, you'd be panicking, too!

163
00:08:52,073 --> 00:08:53,658
You're right.

164
00:08:53,741 --> 00:08:57,620
Everything you're going through right now,
I've gone through.

165
00:08:58,162 --> 00:09:01,040
[gasps]
Whoa! You're part mute?

166
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:03,751
-You're like me!
-[chuckles] No.

167
00:09:03,834 --> 00:09:05,836
You're like me.

168
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:10,466
Your questions don't have easy answers,
but I'll help you with all of them.

169
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:12,426
That sounds really good.

170
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:18,182
[Mulholland humming]

171
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:21,852
<i>â™ª The world is a great big world â™ª</i>

172
00:09:21,936 --> 00:09:23,187
<i>â™ª Oh, wow â™ª</i>

173

When I was pregnant with you,

196
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:12,088
I would come down here to show you
my favorite place in the burrow.

197
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:14,674
I would talk to you,
tell you about my day,

198

About how I couldn't wait to meet you.

199

And now, here we are together.

200
00:11:19,387 --> 00:11:23,557
I can't tell you what this feels like
to be here with you, right now.

201
00:11:23,641 --> 00:11:25,518
I might have an idea.

This is what I was afraid of.

205
00:11:35,486 --> 00:11:39,240
Kipo, sometimes, when you're special,
you can feel very alone.

206
00:11:39,323 --> 00:11:42,952
When Dad tried to help me before,
I know he didn't mean to,

207
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:46,038
but it made me feel more alone.

208
00:11:46,789 --> 00:11:48,624
I know what it's like to feel that way.

209
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:53,254
But now we have each other,
and you'll never be alone again.

We better find something else to hunt

we're bringing too much attention to Kipo.

there's no hiding from the world.

Wolf, you didn't show her the map.

247
00:15:09,491 --> 00:15:12,244
You're right.
I can't keep a secret forever.

248
00:15:12,328 --> 00:15:14,788
Kipo, I hid a map from you.

249
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:17,291
I think it could have
led you to your dad.

250
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:19,793
I'm sorry.

251
00:15:27,676 --> 00:15:28,677
Whatever.

252
00:15:29,887 --> 00:15:32,765
It's in the past.
No point dwelling on it.

You! What'd you do to us?

264
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:11,679
That ram must have been your guilt,
little pup.

265
00:16:11,762 --> 00:16:14,932
Those are some big feelings
you got sealed up tight like a jelly jar

266

to interfere with the dream
I made for you.

267
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:18,686
You mean the first time
someone has woken up

268
00:16:18,769 --> 00:16:21,647
out of one of your messed-up dreams
before you digest them?

269

Oh, that doesn't sound right.
That sounds sad.

Wake up!

I wouldn't do that to your friend.

-You'll wake her up.
-I want to wake her up!

If you wake them up,
you'll yank them from perfection.

275
00:16:39,081 --> 00:16:43,252
I can reveal a better dream to you.
I can make you more buff.

276
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:46,088
I don't want anything
that turns me into this.

277
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:50,259
A hamster? I could definitely
make you a furry hamster.

No! Dead!

00:16:53,345 --> 00:16:57,182

Did you know this wasn't real?

288
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:29,465
Yeah, man.
I made shirts.

00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:32,468
"I went to Benson and Dave's
super sick house party

290

because it's not real."

291

Yeah, something this awesome
definitely couldn't exist.

292
00:17:40,434 --> 00:17:42,394
This is totally not real.

293
00:17:42,478 --> 00:17:44,480
Looks like our fantasy heard us.

294
00:17:44,938 --> 00:17:47,775
-We take it back!
-Let us stay!

295
00:17:47,858 --> 00:17:50,110

Benson, are you OK?

299
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:56,784
I was five minutes ago.

300
00:17:56,867 --> 00:17:59,161
-Can we go back?
-We were so popular!

301
00:17:59,244 --> 00:18:01,371
You were going to die!
Wake up the pig.

302
00:18:01,455 --> 00:18:03,832
I gotta help...
Kipo!

303
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:05,542
I don't think so, little pup.

304
00:18:05,626 --> 00:18:07,669
Her fantasy is my best work yet.

305
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:09,755
I had her mom come back to life.

306
00:18:09,838 --> 00:18:12,674
I made her feel strong
in the face of adversity.

307
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:17,638
I don't get jealous,
but if I did, I would be... of me.

308
00:18:18,055 --> 00:18:20,140
[laughs]

309
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:27,106
You may have tried to control
our fantasies, Water Bear...

[grunts]

311
00:18:31,568 --> 00:18:33,946

00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:39,701
Huh?

[Wolf]<i> Kipo!</i>

315
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:44,081
What was that?

316
00:18:44,164 --> 00:18:45,833
Oh, that's cave acoustics.

317
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:49,586
The roundness of the place makes
noises ricochet and it can sound weird.

318
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:51,171
Something's not right.

319
00:18:51,255 --> 00:18:54,007
I can make some soup when we get home
if you're not feeling well.

320
00:18:54,091 --> 00:18:55,676
No, I feel fine.

321
00:18:55,926 --> 00:18:57,469
It's all this.

322
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:01,140
Something's wrong with all of this.

323
00:19:01,223 --> 00:19:05,102
It's because some of the people
you saw today didn't accept you, isn't it?

324
00:19:05,185 --> 00:19:06,979
I get it.
And I love you.

325
00:19:07,062 --> 00:19:08,605
I accept you.

326
00:19:09,273 --> 00:19:12,317
I know you're part mute,
and I know you are special.

327
00:19:12,401 --> 00:19:17,656
You saying that, coming back,
it's too good to be true.

328
00:19:17,948 --> 00:19:19,825
Are you really part mute?

329
00:19:19,908 --> 00:19:21,285
Why would you ask that?

330
00:19:21,618 --> 00:19:24,955
Mom, please, answer me.
Are you?

331
00:19:25,122 --> 00:19:28,083
I am part mute
because you believe I'm part mute.

332
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:30,460
That's all you need.
It can be that way forever.

333
00:19:30,544 --> 00:19:34,965
You can forget Benson, Dave, Wolf, Mandu,
because you'll have me and Dad.

334
00:19:35,048 --> 00:19:38,468
You know my friends' names.
You're not part mute.

335
00:19:38,552 --> 00:19:40,554
There was no Mega Bunny
that took you away.

336
00:19:40,637 --> 00:19:42,639
You got sick when I was a baby.

337
00:19:42,723 --> 00:19:45,976
[Wolf]<i> Kipo, wake up!</i>

You're not like me.

I'm all alone after all.

342
00:19:57,154 --> 00:19:59,281
I... I have to go find my real dad.

343
00:19:59,907 --> 00:20:03,076
If you do this, I'll be gone forever.

344
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:06,580
I'm sorry,
but you're not really here.

345
00:20:06,663 --> 00:20:09,333
Because this isn't real.

346
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:11,960
[muffled screaming]

347
00:20:12,294 --> 00:20:13,629
[both scream]

348
00:20:21,553 --> 00:20:23,347
Kipo, are you OK?

349
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:25,182
[gasps] Yeah. Where are we?

350
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:26,767
[gasps]

351
00:20:32,439 --> 00:20:33,440
[Mulholland] Wait a second.

352
00:20:34,858 --> 00:20:36,902
So, you're all happier to be here,

353
00:20:36,985 --> 00:20:39,863
instead of the perfect world
I created for you?

354
00:20:39,947 --> 00:20:40,864
-Uh-huh.
-Mm-hmm.

355
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:46,078
I was supposed to take you on a journey,
and you guys took me on one instead.

356
00:20:46,161 --> 00:20:49,248
I'm starting to think this isn't
the best way to get my nutrients.

357
00:20:49,331 --> 00:20:53,043
I'm gonna take time
to do some thinking at the mountains.

358
00:20:53,126 --> 00:20:56,755
And also at the sea.
And maybe outer space.

359
00:21:01,677 --> 00:21:04,012
Well, that's gotta be the weirdest mute
I've ever come across.

360
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:05,013
[chuckles]

361
00:21:10,435 --> 00:21:11,520
Kipo?

362
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:13,563
I need to tell you something.

363
00:21:13,647 --> 00:21:15,649
Is it about finding my dad?

364
00:21:15,732 --> 00:21:18,735
I thought I heard you say something
about that in my dream.

365
00:21:19,736 --> 00:21:22,114
When we split up
to find birthday presents...

366
00:21:22,739 --> 00:21:25,075
Dave and I found this.

367
00:21:25,158 --> 00:21:27,411
We did?
I'm so proud of us.

368
00:21:27,494 --> 00:21:28,662
-[clears throat]
-[grunts]

369
00:21:29,454 --> 00:21:32,749
There's a backup burrow?

370
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:35,460
I had no idea there was a failsafe.

371
00:21:35,544 --> 00:21:37,504
That must be where my people are headed.

372
00:21:37,587 --> 00:21:40,090
Only this says we were
going in the wrong direction.

373
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:42,259
And you knew?

374
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:47,639
-Kipo, I'm so sorry.
-My dad left me a note,

375
00:21:47,723 --> 00:21:49,474
and you hid it from me.

376
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:51,268
-I'm sorry--
-How could you?

377
00:21:55,022 --> 00:21:56,481
I was afraid of losing you!

378
00:21:57,107 --> 00:21:59,901
I was afraid because when you go
back underground, that will be it!

379
00:22:00,444 --> 00:22:03,030
All this, us, we'll be over!

380
00:22:03,113 --> 00:22:06,825
We'll go our...
our separate ways.

381
00:22:19,463 --> 00:22:21,423
[grunting]

382
00:22:22,632 --> 00:22:24,134
Oh, I remember now!

383
00:22:24,217 --> 00:22:26,136
The Parts Etcetera store!

384
00:22:26,219 --> 00:22:28,513
You should've seen
the look on Wolfie's face

385
00:22:28,597 --> 00:22:30,891
when she realized that map meant goodbye.

386
00:22:30,974 --> 00:22:32,768
I don't think she likes goodbyes.

387
00:22:33,351 --> 00:22:34,936
[Benson]
We got that, Dave.

388
00:22:36,271 --> 00:22:38,607
[giggles]
