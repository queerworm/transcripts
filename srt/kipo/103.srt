[squealing]

2
00:00:17,934 --> 00:00:21,229
Today's the day.
All the way to the ceiling.

3
00:00:22,313 --> 00:00:23,314
[groans]

4
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:25,108
What's the holdup, slowpoke?

5
00:00:25,442 --> 00:00:27,485
No holdup. Why?

6
00:00:27,569 --> 00:00:29,529
[giggles]
Does it look like I'm holding up?

7
00:00:29,904 --> 00:00:33,616
No, you are clearly not holding up.

8
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:35,618
But, uh, while we're waiting, tell me,

9
00:00:35,702 --> 00:00:37,954
what minerals are in most abundance
at this stratum?

10
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:42,751
Dad, that's easy: azurite and malachite,
two of my favorite "ites."

11
00:00:43,126 --> 00:00:44,961
If you can ace a pop geology quiz,

12
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:47,005
then I know you can make it
the rest of the way.

13
00:00:48,423 --> 00:00:49,591
[grunts]

14
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:57,474
[rumbling]

15
00:00:57,849 --> 00:00:58,683
Hmm.

16
00:00:59,142 --> 00:01:02,020
Whoo!
Just a Mega Mute passing overhead.

17
00:01:02,103 --> 00:01:03,772
Little close, but nothing to worry about.

18
00:01:04,939 --> 00:01:09,152
Two, three, four...
Five seconds between footsteps.

19
00:01:09,235 --> 00:01:12,113
Whoa, this one's big.
What do you think it is?

20
00:01:12,197 --> 00:01:16,201
I'm guessing a 400-foot-tall squirrel
with eight tails.

21
00:01:16,284 --> 00:01:19,454
Maybe it's a giant dolphin
that's adapted to walk on land.

22
00:01:19,537 --> 00:01:20,830
Dolphin?

23
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:23,416
Well, I did read once
they have vestigial leg bones...

24
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:24,334
[Mega Mute roars]

25
00:01:24,417 --> 00:01:26,961
-...from millions of years ago.
-They found us...

26
00:01:27,045 --> 00:01:30,590
Did you know they used to look like horses
before they went into the water?

27
00:01:30,673 --> 00:01:33,009
Dad, Dad, are you listening to me?

28
00:01:33,092 --> 00:01:35,261

00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:40,266

[grunting]

33
00:01:49,442 --> 00:01:50,443
Kipo!

34
00:01:51,027 --> 00:01:52,278
[grunting]

35
00:01:57,826 --> 00:01:59,619
[Mega Mute grunting]

36
00:02:11,673 --> 00:02:12,632
It's OK.

37
00:02:12,924 --> 00:02:15,260
You got Kipo out OK,
that's what matters.

38
00:02:15,343 --> 00:02:16,344
The rest...

39
00:02:16,845 --> 00:02:18,721
[roaring]

40
00:02:23,101 --> 00:02:24,060
Piece of cake?

41
00:02:24,602 --> 00:02:26,896
[growling]

42
00:02:28,648 --> 00:02:30,275
[theme playing]

43
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:55,967
Uh... guys?

44
00:02:56,259 --> 00:02:57,385
More mutes!

45
00:02:57,468 --> 00:02:59,721
Are these ones friendly or unfriendly?

46
00:02:59,971 --> 00:03:03,016
There's an entire army of them.
Packing axes.

47
00:03:03,099 --> 00:03:05,977
-What do you think?
-Unfriendly. Got it.

48
00:03:07,103 --> 00:03:08,855
Charge!

49
00:03:08,938 --> 00:03:10,189
[all yelling]

50
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:15,236
Oh, man! Oh, man!
Those are Timbercats!

51
00:03:15,486 --> 00:03:18,239
-Cats eat bugs!
-Dave, you're flying!

52
00:03:18,323 --> 00:03:19,240
Fly us out of here!

53
00:03:20,658 --> 00:03:22,702

54
00:03:23,536 --> 00:03:24,829

-[all grunt]

55
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:27,332
Yeah, sorry, guys.

56
00:03:27,415 --> 00:03:30,084
Dave's got a little bit of, uh...
performance anxiety issues.

57
00:03:30,168 --> 00:03:31,461
Lesson seven of the surface:

58
00:03:31,544 --> 00:03:33,338
[battle cries]

59
00:03:33,421 --> 00:03:34,464
Know when to run!

00:03:44,015 --> 00:03:45,308
[panting]

61
00:03:45,433 --> 00:03:47,977
[cat screeches]
The footprints led right here!

62
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:50,647
The monster's got to be here somewhere.
Keep looking!

63
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:55,109
Tree-stealer!
Where are you hiding?

64
00:03:57,737 --> 00:04:02,408
We're wasting our time.
Whatever it is, it's long gone by now.

65
00:04:02,492 --> 00:04:05,703
[hisses] You can't know that for sure,
Molly Yarnchopper!

66
00:04:05,787 --> 00:04:06,829
I know what I see.

67
00:04:06,996 --> 00:04:10,875
You think your tiny axes can stop
the thing that did all this?

68
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:13,711
[gasps]
That's from the Scratching Tree.

69
00:04:13,795 --> 00:04:16,005
Raise your axes for the Scratching Tree!

70
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:17,674
[all meowing]

71
00:04:19,676 --> 00:04:22,845
The Mega Mute must have used
our tree to make this crater.

72
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:25,348
We're no match for a beast
who could do that.

73
00:04:26,182 --> 00:04:27,267
Not with our leader gone.

74
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:30,270
Not without Yumyan Hammerpaw.

75
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:33,648
Guys, I think the Mega Mute
they're looking for,

76
00:04:33,731 --> 00:04:35,942
is the same one who destroyed my city.

77
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:38,236
What if my people didn't get away?

78
00:04:38,528 --> 00:04:39,862
What if it took them?

79
00:04:40,863 --> 00:04:42,615
We should team up
with these cats to find it.

80
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:45,576
-We have an enemy in common.
-Oh, Kipo.

81
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:48,746
Humans and mutes don't mix
unless they're eating us.

82
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:50,248
But they have an army!

83
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:52,917
[gasps, groans]

84
00:04:53,668 --> 00:04:54,794
Hi, there!

85
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:59,090
Um, funny coincidence,
the Mega Mute you're looking for?

86
00:04:59,173 --> 00:05:02,010
We're looking for it, too.
We should totally team up!

87
00:05:02,093 --> 00:05:04,012
Uh... and I know what you're thinking.

88
00:05:04,095 --> 00:05:05,972
Humans and mutes?
Crazy.

89
00:05:06,055 --> 00:05:10,393
But I say peace between the species.
Right?

90
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:13,896
I tried.

91
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,822
Something tells me this isn't
the kind of sand you find at the beach.

92
00:05:23,072 --> 00:05:24,782
[squealing]

93
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:28,202
Hey! Litter is not food!

94
00:05:28,286 --> 00:05:30,079
If you had listened to me,
we would have gotten away.

95
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:32,373
Clearly, the cats need some time

96
00:05:32,457 --> 00:05:34,542
to warm up to the idea
of working with humans.

97
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:35,918
[meowing]

98
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:38,796
Maybe a lot of time.
But I will win them over.

99
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,507
I don't work with mutes.

100
00:05:42,467 --> 00:05:44,677
I tell you,
these years go by so fast.

101
00:05:50,683 --> 00:05:52,435

[all screeching]

105
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:07,575
Stand at attention!
You're in front of the Scratching Tree!

106
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:13,956
It looks like it's... um, how do I say,
uh, not much of a tree anymore.

107
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:17,543
Hey!
It's sacred to our very way of life!

108
00:06:17,627 --> 00:06:21,589
What's that on your sweater, human?
Is that supposed to be funny?

109
00:06:21,672 --> 00:06:25,593
Oh, this old rag?
It's from a very long time ago,

110
00:06:25,676 --> 00:06:29,430
when humans used to
keep cats as, uh, pets.

111
00:06:29,514 --> 00:06:31,682
You know, I...
I can just wear it like this.

112
00:06:32,308 --> 00:06:33,142
[grunts]

113
00:06:34,602 --> 00:06:36,521
I'm back in fightin' shape.

114
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:40,733
Aw, man, I just remembered we got caught.

115
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:43,027
What do we do with these humans?
Should we eat 'em?

116
00:06:43,694 --> 00:06:46,239
We'd have to clean them first,
they rode here in the litter.

117
00:06:46,322 --> 00:06:49,659
I say we bat them between our paws
for several hours until we get bored.

118
00:06:49,784 --> 00:06:50,785
I wish Yumyan were here.

119
00:06:50,868 --> 00:06:51,869
He'd know what to do.

120
00:06:51,953 --> 00:06:53,454
-He always decides these things for us.
-[cat 1] Eat them!

121

-[cat 1] Eat them!

00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:55,706
-[cat 2] Bat them!
-[cat 1] Eat them!

123
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:58,167
There's only one way to settle it.

[all screeching]

126
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:07,468
We need to get out of this madhouse
as soon as possible.

127
00:07:07,844 --> 00:07:08,761
But look at them!

128
00:07:08,845 --> 00:07:11,139
The poor things are lost
without their friend Yumyan.

129
00:07:11,222 --> 00:07:13,391
[both crying]

130
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,477
We should help them find him!

131
00:07:16,561 --> 00:07:20,690
And not for selfish reasons,
although we do need to win them over,

132
00:07:20,773 --> 00:07:22,066
it's just the right thing to do!

133
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:24,318
Yeah, no.
I'm with Tiny on this one.

134
00:07:24,402 --> 00:07:26,446
Call me that again and you're a dead man.

135
00:07:27,029 --> 00:07:29,866
No!
This isn't right!

136
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:31,993
It's just not the same,
not without Yumyan!

137
00:07:32,869 --> 00:07:34,412
Ohh!

138
00:07:34,871 --> 00:07:38,166
If you don't mind me asking,
who is this Yumyan?

139
00:07:38,499 --> 00:07:41,461
This human keeps talking to us.
Why does she keep doing that?

140
00:07:41,669 --> 00:07:45,465
Who is Yumyan Hammerpaw?
He's the Lord of the Timbercats!

141
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:48,551
Or at least... he was.

142
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:56,184
Oh... sorry.

143
00:07:56,267 --> 00:07:59,103
So long, Yumyan.
Hardly knew ya.

144
00:07:59,604 --> 00:08:01,606
[screeching]

145
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:04,734
Whoa, what is that?

146
00:08:04,817 --> 00:08:07,069
Sounds like Pierre, Yumyan's pet.

147
00:08:07,403 --> 00:08:08,696
You might want to duck.

00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:17,413
Timber!

151
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:22,585
OK, that tree was not stable.

152
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:24,045
How come no one thought to chop it down?

153
00:08:24,128 --> 00:08:27,048
Does Yumyan have to remind us
to do everything?

154
00:08:27,131 --> 00:08:30,009
Uh, somebody still needs to get Pierre
back on his leash.

155
00:08:30,301 --> 00:08:33,638
-[screeching]
-[screaming]

156
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:36,390
Any volunteers?

157
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:38,184
[Kipo]
We volunteer!

158
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:40,269
Really?

159
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:45,983
I have half a mind
to put that thing around your neck.

160
00:08:46,067 --> 00:08:48,528
Don't you ever do things
you don't want to do, to help others?

161
00:08:48,611 --> 00:08:49,612
[grunts] Nope.

162
00:08:49,987 --> 00:08:51,072
Are you gonna hit him with that?

163
00:08:51,155 --> 00:08:53,741
What do you want me to stop him with,
a dirty look?

164
00:08:53,824 --> 00:08:55,201
[chittering]

165
00:08:56,327 --> 00:08:57,495
OK, on the count of three--

166
00:08:57,578 --> 00:08:58,579
[all] Charge!

167
00:08:59,247 --> 00:09:00,331

[nervous chuckle]

171
00:09:20,851 --> 00:09:21,769
No, no, no, no, no, no!

172
00:09:21,852 --> 00:09:23,479
Kipo, tuck and roll!

173
00:09:33,864 --> 00:09:35,241
[all gasping]

174
00:09:37,285 --> 00:09:41,163
Ohh, you were just a sweet, hungry pet,

175
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:44,000
who hasn't had a bite in days.

176
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:47,211

00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:27,708
-Charles!
-OK, that's enough!

350
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:29,877
I'm not the only one
who needs your help!

351
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:33,755
You have a whole village down there
that's falling apart without you!

352
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:36,592
I know what it's like
to lose someone important.

353
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:39,011
I just lost my dad.

354
00:19:39,469 --> 00:19:42,222
Believe me,
it's not a good feeling.

355
00:19:42,306 --> 00:19:45,684
But... I can't leave!
I lost our tree!

356
00:19:45,767 --> 00:19:49,188
The great Axe Lords of yore
spent years scratching and sculpting it,

357
00:19:49,271 --> 00:19:50,689
getting it just right!

358
00:19:50,772 --> 00:19:52,482
And Charles, has its spirit!

359
00:19:52,566 --> 00:19:54,693
Now you're just making excuses!

360
00:19:54,776 --> 00:19:56,570
[growling]

361
00:19:58,614 --> 00:20:00,741
[sighs]
You're right.

362
00:20:01,783 --> 00:20:03,035
I ran.

363
00:20:03,118 --> 00:20:05,579
I ran away from the tree thief in fear.

364
00:20:05,662 --> 00:20:07,831
So, that's why you're stuck.

365
00:20:08,665 --> 00:20:09,875
Wanna tell me about it?

366
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:15,839
I was having my evening scratch,
the next thing,

367
00:20:15,923 --> 00:20:19,218
I'm looking up at the biggest monster
I've ever seen.

368
00:20:19,301 --> 00:20:23,388
Six arms,
eyes red as a logger's flannel.

369
00:20:23,472 --> 00:20:26,433
So, I ran up this tree.

370
00:20:27,809 --> 00:20:32,231
Any sane person, mute or human,
would have done the same.

371
00:20:32,314 --> 00:20:34,691
Not a leader of Timbercats.

372
00:20:34,775 --> 00:20:35,984
And look at them down there.

373
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:39,279
[hacking]

374
00:20:39,363 --> 00:20:41,949
I am. And you know what?

375
00:20:42,032 --> 00:20:45,202
They need you a lot more than their tree.

376
00:20:45,285 --> 00:20:47,496
She's right.
They need you, man.

377
00:20:48,121 --> 00:20:50,040
-Uh...
-Maybe you're right.

378
00:20:50,832 --> 00:20:52,000
Hmm...

379
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:54,836
So, are you ready to go back down?

380
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:55,963
[groans]

381
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:59,216
OK, just... but just give me a minute.

382
00:20:59,341 --> 00:21:02,511
[grunts]
Kipo owns you all!

383
00:21:02,594 --> 00:21:04,346
[Yumyan yells]

384
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:10,519
First the Scratching Tree,
then Yumyan,

385
00:21:10,602 --> 00:21:13,146
and now the prisoners are gone, too.

386
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:15,816
It's like we're not even
Timbercats anymore.

387
00:21:15,899 --> 00:21:20,529
As long as we have axes in our paws,
we'll always be Timbercats.

388
00:21:20,612 --> 00:21:24,157
And as long as we have Yumyan
in our hearts, he'll always be--

389
00:21:24,241 --> 00:21:27,327
Right there!
He's right there!

390
00:21:27,411 --> 00:21:28,996
[yelling]

391
00:21:29,079 --> 00:21:31,331
Yumyan owns you all!

392
00:21:32,332 --> 00:21:34,793
[screaming, grunting]

393
00:21:35,544 --> 00:21:37,045
[screaming]

394
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:42,426
[panting]

395
00:21:42,509 --> 00:21:44,052
[grunts]

396
00:21:46,388 --> 00:21:48,807
[all cheering]

397
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:53,645
I almost forgot
what it was like to hold this.

398
00:21:53,729 --> 00:21:55,856
[cheering]

399
00:21:58,483 --> 00:22:01,778
[Wolf] Guys, we had one job:
keep Kipo from dying!

400
00:22:01,862 --> 00:22:02,821
Hmm. Let me see.

401
00:22:02,904 --> 00:22:06,241
Who was supposed to stay up all night
making sure Kipo didn't ditch the camp?

402
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:07,826
That's right.
None of us.

403
00:22:07,909 --> 00:22:10,746
Because she's her own person
who makes her own decisions.

404
00:22:10,829 --> 00:22:12,414
If the Timbercats
haven't already killed her,

405
00:22:12,497 --> 00:22:14,458
I may have to kill her myself.

406
00:22:14,541 --> 00:22:16,460
[squealing]

407
00:22:22,466 --> 00:22:24,634
[Kipo exclaims]
This is going to be so cute!

408
00:22:25,385 --> 00:22:27,721
That's not exactly the look
I was going for.

409
00:22:27,804 --> 00:22:29,348
Guys! There you are!

410
00:22:29,431 --> 00:22:32,267
You know how I said
I wanted to hunt down that Mega Mute?

411
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:35,437
And you were all like,
"Yeah, you and what army?"

412
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:38,690
Well, guess what?
We have an army!

413
00:22:39,566 --> 00:22:41,193
[all roaring]

414
00:22:47,365 --> 00:22:50,118
<i>♪ He was born with an axe in his fur ♪</i>

415
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:53,121
<i>♪ The toughest cat that you ever saw ♪</i>

416
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:56,666
<i>♪ Well, he can chop down a tree</i>
<i>With just one swing ♪</i>

417
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:59,628
<i>♪ We call him Yumyan Hammerpaw ♪</i>

418
00:23:00,295 --> 00:23:02,923
<i>♪ Whoa! Whoa! ♪</i>

419
00:23:03,006 --> 00:23:06,176
<i>♪ We call him Yumyan Hammerpaw ♪</i>

420
00:23:10,388 --> 00:23:11,807
[laughter]
