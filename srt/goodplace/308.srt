-[Doug] Mmm.

111
00:05:07,515 --> 00:05:11,102

because technically none of that happened

I'm sure someone's weighed in.

138

No, no, I'm flattered
that you would seek my advice.

139
00:06:23,758 --> 00:06:26,302
Though, I suppose it makes sense.

140
00:06:26,385 --> 00:06:28,179
I'm sure the one constant
in all the reboots

141
00:06:28,262 --> 00:06:30,098
is that you and I were best friends.

142
00:06:30,181 --> 00:06:32,600
Uh-huh. Yeah. Mmm-hmm.

143
00:06:32,683 --> 00:06:36,687
I don't think you would want Chidi
to know what happened in the past

144
00:06:36,771 --> 00:06:40,483
unless you wanted it
to happen again in the present.

145
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,569
You can't know how Chidi will react.

146
00:06:43,653 --> 00:06:44,987
It may be painful,

147
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:48,866

to tell someone how you feel.

Don't worry about Raymond.

Please don't give me your shoe.

168

Well, then give me your shoe,
or I'll be sad.

169
00:07:43,838 --> 00:07:44,672
Here you are.

170
00:07:45,256 --> 00:07:46,090
[grunts]

171
00:07:46,174 --> 00:07:47,550
[cackles]

172
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:49,260
Well, as long as he's happy.

173
00:07:49,343 --> 00:07:51,304
See, if I make him happy,
I get the points.

174
00:07:51,387 --> 00:07:53,347
That's how the system works, remember?

175
00:07:53,431 --> 00:07:54,724
[Raymond] Go get your shoe, idiot!

176
00:07:54,807 --> 00:07:56,309
[chuckles] Be right back.

177
00:07:56,392 --> 00:07:57,518
-[stick breaks]
-Ah!

178
00:07:57,602 --> 00:07:59,312
-Oh, that's a bleeder!
-[Janet] Oh.

179
00:07:59,395 --> 00:08:00,438
[Doug] Yeah.

180
00:08:02,106 --> 00:08:05,943
Michael, face facts. Doug is not
the blueprint of how to live a good life.

181
00:08:06,027 --> 00:08:07,445
He's become a happiness pump.

182
00:08:07,528 --> 00:08:09,864
-What?
-Remember from Chidi's lessons?

183
00:08:09,947 --> 00:08:11,616
I remember the term "happiness pump."

184
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:14,202
That's just mostly
because Eleanor and Jason

185
00:08:14,285 --> 00:08:15,786
made a bunch of dirty jokes about it.

186
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:18,372
It's a criticism of utilitarianism.

187
00:08:18,456 --> 00:08:20,500
A happiness pump is
someone who is obsessed

188
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:23,503
with maximizing the overall good
at his or her expense.

189
00:08:23,586 --> 00:08:27,298
Doug will do literally anything
to make other people happy

190
00:08:27,381 --> 00:08:28,966
even if it makes him miserable.

191
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:31,093
I don't think he's miserable.

192
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:34,639
So, everyone happy and contented in here?

193
00:08:34,722 --> 00:08:36,182
-What's...
-[Doug] Oh.

194
00:08:36,265 --> 00:08:38,935
I volunteer to test cosmetics
for a local company

195
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:40,645
so they don't have to test on animals.

196
00:08:40,728 --> 00:08:43,689
It's fun... for the animals who
don't have to do it.

197
00:08:43,773 --> 00:08:46,192
For me, it's like wearing a mask of fire.

198
00:08:46,275 --> 00:08:47,860
Uh, what can I do for you now?

199
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:49,529
Would you like to move in permanently?

200
00:08:49,612 --> 00:08:52,490
Or would either of you like any more water
or one of my kidneys?

201
00:08:52,573 --> 00:08:55,618
You know what, we have absolutely
everything we need, thank you.

202
00:08:55,701 --> 00:08:57,328
-We're gonna head out now.
-Okay.

203
00:08:57,411 --> 00:09:00,122
It was so nice to meet you, Janet,
and you, Mark.

204
00:09:01,165 --> 00:09:02,667
I mean, Michael. [gasps]

205
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:03,960
I called you Mark.

206
00:09:04,669 --> 00:09:05,878
[voice quivers] Your name is Michael.

207
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:06,879
No, that's okay.

208
00:09:06,963 --> 00:09:08,506
Hey, stay with me here, buddy.

209
00:09:08,589 --> 00:09:10,466
No, no, no. This is very bad.

210
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:13,344
Forgetting someone's name,
that's definitely lost me some points.

211
00:09:13,427 --> 00:09:16,389
You know, I always secretly wished
my name was Mark.

212
00:09:16,472 --> 00:09:18,558
Lie! [inhales sharply] That's a lie!

213
00:09:19,475 --> 00:09:21,894
Now, I'm accusing you of lying,
and now I'm yelling.

214
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:22,979
Why am I yelling?

215
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:24,063
I need to make this up.

216
00:09:24,146 --> 00:09:26,857
I'm gonna give you a really nice haircut.

217
00:09:27,525 --> 00:09:28,359
[crunches]

218
00:09:29,026 --> 00:09:30,486
-Was that...
-A snail?

219
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:32,697
-Yeah, that was a snail. Ooh.
-[squishes]

220
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:34,991
[Doug sobbing] No, no, no, no, no!

221
00:09:35,074 --> 00:09:36,659
I think he's still alive.

222
00:09:36,742 --> 00:09:39,662
Do either of you know anything
about snail first-aid?

223
00:09:39,745 --> 00:09:41,205
-No.
-Yes. I mean, no.

224
00:09:41,289 --> 00:09:45,126
All right, Michael, I need you to find
some Scotch tape while I apply pressure.

225
00:09:45,209 --> 00:09:46,043
[squishes]

226
00:09:46,127 --> 00:09:48,921
[sobbing] Too much pressure!
I'm gonna need that tape!

227
00:09:50,047 --> 00:09:53,718
-Oh! What?
-Jacksonville style, baby!

228
00:09:53,801 --> 00:09:55,970
Thirty million points.

229
00:09:56,053 --> 00:09:57,054
Nice one, homie!

230
00:09:57,138 --> 00:09:58,806
Hey, what are you guys doing?

231
00:09:58,889 --> 00:10:02,351
Oh, I either know exactly what I'm doing
and it's something,

232
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:04,520
or we're doing nothing and I'm winning.

233
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:07,273
Congrats. Um... can I talk to you
for a second?

234
00:10:07,356 --> 00:10:09,650
Okay, uh, a few days ago,

235
00:10:10,693 --> 00:10:12,153
Michael showed me something.

236
00:10:12,862 --> 00:10:16,574
And I don't know exactly how to say this,

237
00:10:16,657 --> 00:10:18,909
but you and I are...

238
00:10:18,993 --> 00:10:19,869
[door opens]

239
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:22,455
Bambadjan.

240
00:10:24,749 --> 00:10:27,877
I never thought about it before, but yeah,
we are kind of "Bambadjan."

241
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,920
No, you jetlagged doof!

242
00:10:30,004 --> 00:10:33,507
Bambadjan is the name of a demon
from the Bad Place

243
00:10:33,591 --> 00:10:36,093
who is somehow right over there.

244
00:10:40,389 --> 00:10:42,892
-Come with me. Right now.
-[Chidi] Okay.

245
00:10:42,975 --> 00:10:44,852
Hey, guys, having fun? Cool, cool, cool.

246
00:10:44,935 --> 00:10:47,980
We need to get out of here immediately,
because this bar is full of demons.

247
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:51,108
Just because these people are wearing
cheap leather and stone-washed denim.

248
00:10:51,192 --> 00:10:53,361
They're still part of the queen's realm.
Calling them demons is a bit much.

249
00:10:53,444 --> 00:10:55,363
No, no, no, actual demons.

250
00:10:55,446 --> 00:10:56,906
Like, from the Bad Place.

251
00:10:56,989 --> 00:10:59,033
Okay, Chidi and I are gonna go
out the side door.

252
00:10:59,116 --> 00:11:00,201
You and Tahani go out the back.

253
00:11:00,284 --> 00:11:02,036
Or we do this the old-fashioned way.

254
00:11:02,119 --> 00:11:03,621
-[Tahani] No!
-How did you make that so fast?

255
00:11:03,704 --> 00:11:04,914
[shouting] Bortle--

256
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:08,626
[Jason straining]

257
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:13,672
Hello, idiots. Surprised to see me?

258
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:17,802
[sighs] Right. You don't remember.

259
00:11:17,885 --> 00:11:20,262
I'm Shawn. You are very scared of me.

260
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:22,890
Now, where's Michael?

261
00:11:23,557 --> 00:11:25,393
[Doug] We are here to celebrate the life

262
00:11:25,476 --> 00:11:28,437
of Martin Luther Gandhi Tyler Moore,
the snail.

263
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:31,690
I named him/her that posthumously,

264
00:11:31,774 --> 00:11:34,402
because I imagine him/her to be

265
00:11:34,485 --> 00:11:38,072
the greatest and most talented snail
ever to have lived.

266
00:11:40,241 --> 00:11:42,493
Michael, would you care
to say a few words?

267
00:11:42,576 --> 00:11:43,494
[chuckles]

268
00:11:44,703 --> 00:11:47,164
Oh. You're serious. Yes, uh, okay.

269
00:11:47,248 --> 00:11:51,043
Martin was a lot of things.

270
00:11:51,127 --> 00:11:54,171
A snail, mostly, but also a friend.

271
00:11:54,255 --> 00:11:55,131
[Janet] Mmm.

272
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:59,510
Martin taught us about life, about love,

273
00:11:59,593 --> 00:12:03,681
and about the limits of Scotch tape.

274
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:06,142
[Doug] Goodbye, Martin.

275
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:08,018
Happy slimy trails, old friend.

276
00:12:09,437 --> 00:12:11,397
I'm sorry, I've gotta leave right away.

277
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,315
I've decided to make a donation

278
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:17,319
to the Canadian Mollusk Association
in Martin's honor.

279
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:22,074
Their office is in Edmonton,
so it will take me about three weeks

280
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:23,284
to walk there and back.

281
00:12:23,951 --> 00:12:25,077
Take care.

282
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:27,872
Look out, little fellas.
Heads up. [chuckles]

283
00:12:28,456 --> 00:12:29,290
Here comes a shoe.

284
00:12:29,373 --> 00:12:32,877
Say, Doug, look, do you mind if we ask you
just a few more questions?

285
00:12:34,295 --> 00:12:36,881
What you're doing here,
how you're living your life,

286
00:12:36,964 --> 00:12:38,048
-is just so wonderful.
-[Janet] Mmm.

287
00:12:38,132 --> 00:12:40,759
But can I maybe give you
just a little advice?

288
00:12:40,843 --> 00:12:42,678
I know, I should donate more blood.

289
00:12:42,761 --> 00:12:45,556
I'll try, but the last time
I went down there,

290
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:48,309
they said I was so anemic,
they ended up giving me blood.

291
00:12:48,392 --> 00:12:49,935
No, look, look, um...

292
00:12:51,103 --> 00:12:53,606
I've been a reporter
for a long time, Doug.

293
00:12:53,689 --> 00:12:55,566
Met all sorts of people.

294
00:12:55,649 --> 00:13:02,531
Traveled all over this crazy blue marble,
meeting regular folks.

295
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:05,868
Every face tells a story, Doug.

296
00:13:05,951 --> 00:13:09,455
Why, I'd say that
those so-called regular folks

297
00:13:09,538 --> 00:13:12,291
often turn out to be
not so regular after all.

298
00:13:12,374 --> 00:13:13,209
Michael.

299
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:16,462
Sorry, the point is,
I have never met anyone

300
00:13:16,545 --> 00:13:21,509
so dedicated to making
other people and snails happy.

301
00:13:21,592 --> 00:13:25,012
If what you're saying is true
about the afterlife,

302
00:13:25,095 --> 00:13:28,140
then you must have earned
more than enough points by now.

303
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:30,476
So, loosen up, bud.

304
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:33,979
Have a little fun.
Eat something besides lentils.

305
00:13:34,063 --> 00:13:34,980
Like radishes?

306
00:13:35,064 --> 00:13:36,815
No! No, Doug. Damn it.

307
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:40,861
Just have ice cream or chicken parm.
Live your life!

308
00:13:40,945 --> 00:13:42,112
Travel!

309
00:13:42,196 --> 00:13:45,324
Drink regular water
that wasn't inside you.

310
00:13:45,407 --> 00:13:47,743
Okay? Just relax.

311
00:13:48,786 --> 00:13:49,703
Thank you, Michael.

312
00:13:50,704 --> 00:13:52,039
But, no.

313
00:13:52,122 --> 00:13:53,999
I can't do any of those things.

314
00:13:54,792 --> 00:13:56,752
-Why not?
-Because I can't risk it.

315
00:13:57,878 --> 00:14:03,634
There's an accountant out there somewhere,
measuring the value of everything I do.

316
00:14:03,717 --> 00:14:08,681
What if I relax and do something
that loses me just enough points

317
00:14:08,764 --> 00:14:12,560
to keep me out of the Good Place,
and I'm tortured for eternity?

318
00:14:13,227 --> 00:14:15,771
No, I have to make every moment count.

319
00:14:15,854 --> 00:14:18,857
It's the only rational way
to live. [chuckles]

320
00:14:18,941 --> 00:14:21,527
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm gonna walk to Edmonton

321
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:24,572
to give $85 to a snail charity.

322
00:14:27,116 --> 00:14:29,660
Why don't you just take us
to the Bad Place already, dude?

323
00:14:29,743 --> 00:14:32,246
Because I wanna see the look on
Michael's face when he realizes he failed.

324
00:14:32,329 --> 00:14:34,415
I love seeing the look on people's faces.

325
00:14:34,498 --> 00:14:35,958
It's the best part of my job.

326
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:38,294
[Eleanor] Dude, Michael's not coming here.

327
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:40,921
Face it, man, you are outmatched.

328
00:14:41,005 --> 00:14:44,008
Because Michael and Janet
are brilliant and savvy.

329
00:14:44,091 --> 00:14:47,094
And they've been ten steps
ahead of you this whole time.

330
00:14:47,177 --> 00:14:49,263
We could sit here as long as you want,

331
00:14:49,346 --> 00:14:55,060
but you will never, ever,
ever see Michael or Janet again--

332
00:14:55,144 --> 00:14:56,562
[Michael] Yikes, that was rough!

333
00:14:56,645 --> 00:14:57,938
-Total bust!
-[Eleanor sighs]

334
00:14:58,022 --> 00:15:02,568
Doug is a complete disaster,
and I drank his piss.

335
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:04,778
Hello, Michael.

336
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:10,451
See? See the look on his face? So great.

337
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:17,041
Hello, Shawn, other demons.
What are you all doing down here?

338
00:15:17,124 --> 00:15:18,876
What do you think we're doing,
you hemorrhoid?

339
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:20,920
We're ending this charade
once and for all.

340
00:15:21,003 --> 00:15:23,923
These four humans
are the legal property of the Bad Place.

341
00:15:24,006 --> 00:15:24,882
That's where we're taking them...

342
00:15:26,675 --> 00:15:27,760
and you.

343
00:15:27,843 --> 00:15:30,554
If you want them,
you're gonna have to go through me.

344
00:15:30,638 --> 00:15:31,847
That's the idea.

345
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:33,849
Well, it's a bad idea.

346
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:35,768
Oh, Michael, when will you ever learn?

347
00:15:35,851 --> 00:15:37,394
Screw this! Let's fight!

[grunting]

350
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:43,359
Get somewhere safe, you guys.

351
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:44,610
[Jason whimpers]

352
00:15:44,693 --> 00:15:47,738
Bad news. I've been going to the gym.
A lot.

353
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,114
[Chidi] Oh, no!

354
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:50,199
Chidi!

355
00:15:50,282 --> 00:15:51,450
[exclaiming]

356
00:15:51,533 --> 00:15:52,618
What is happening?

357
00:15:52,701 --> 00:15:53,619
[Chidi] Ow, ow!

358
00:15:53,702 --> 00:15:56,288
[screams] Let him go! No! Let him go!

359
00:15:56,372 --> 00:15:57,206
[groans]

360
00:15:58,290 --> 00:15:59,124
[bone cracks]

361
00:16:02,044 --> 00:16:02,920
Let him go!

362
00:16:03,003 --> 00:16:05,130
Twelve years of fencing. <i>En garde!</i>

363
00:16:08,217 --> 00:16:10,469
Obviously, I'd never do that
in a competition.

364
00:16:10,552 --> 00:16:13,013
That'd be a three-tenths
deduction. [sighs]

365
00:16:14,056 --> 00:16:14,890
[grunting]

366
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:16,016
No! No! Watch out!

367
00:16:23,774 --> 00:16:25,150
[chuckles] I've never marbleized

368
00:16:25,234 --> 00:16:26,193
-a Janet before.

370
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:30,823
Jacksonville style, baby! 2,000 points!

371
00:16:30,906 --> 00:16:31,991
Thanks, Jason.

372
00:16:32,074 --> 00:16:32,950
[grunting]

373
00:16:34,368 --> 00:16:35,828
Janet, door!

374
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:37,913

[Janet chuckles]

380
00:17:03,105 --> 00:17:04,815
Three hundred points! Best score ever!

381

[screams]

382
00:17:09,445 --> 00:17:11,905
Is it just me or is Janet
a straight-up hottie right now?

383
00:17:11,989 --> 00:17:14,199
How are you this close
to being dragged to hell

384
00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:15,784
-and still horny?
-I don't know.

385
00:17:16,744 --> 00:17:17,953
And how did you know they were demons?

386
00:17:18,787 --> 00:17:20,622
Ugh, I can't tell you that now!

387
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:23,959
Screw it. What am I waiting for?
We could die in the next 30 seconds.

388
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:27,838
So, Michael showed me a memory
of our time in the Good Place,

389
00:17:27,921 --> 00:17:31,508
and you and I were, like, a thing.

390
00:17:31,592 --> 00:17:32,551
-And--
-Gotcha!

391
00:17:32,634 --> 00:17:34,011
[grunts]

392
00:17:34,094 --> 00:17:37,347
Not like a casual, "Hey, I found
two loose pills in the bottom of my tote,

393
00:17:37,431 --> 00:17:39,058
let's pop 'em and see what's good,"
kind of thing.

394
00:17:39,141 --> 00:17:40,267
We were in love.

395
00:17:41,185 --> 00:17:44,855
And there's a real possibility
that I'm in love with you again.

396
00:17:45,439 --> 00:17:47,900
Here. On this plane of existence.

397
00:17:47,983 --> 00:17:52,279
Today. Now. In Canada. During this brawl.

398
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:53,739
With demons.

399
00:17:57,367 --> 00:17:58,786
[demon] Let's get her to the door.

400
00:18:01,663 --> 00:18:02,623
No!

401
00:18:05,167 --> 00:18:06,418
Oh, cool!

402
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:08,420
When I'm even partway
through the door to the afterlife,

403
00:18:08,504 --> 00:18:10,464
-my powers come back.
-They do?

404
00:18:11,965 --> 00:18:13,008

405
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:14,426
[grunts]

406
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:16,095
They do. Thanks for asking.

407
00:18:17,721 --> 00:18:18,722
[screams]

408
00:18:21,016 --> 00:18:22,726
-You're coming with me.
-[both whimpering]

409
00:18:24,228 --> 00:18:25,687
Hi, there.

410
00:18:28,065 --> 00:18:29,066
[Eleanor gasps]

411
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:40,869
We did it!

412
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:41,954
[Chidi stammering]

413
00:18:42,037 --> 00:18:44,623
What? No, yeah.
No, of course. Janet did it.

414
00:18:44,706 --> 00:18:46,250
Yes, but I had the, uh...

415
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:48,919
Thank you, Janet.

416
00:18:52,422 --> 00:18:56,051
How did you get down here?
We have the only key to the door to Earth.

417
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:57,594
We built our own door.

418
00:18:57,678 --> 00:18:58,846
That's impossible.

419
00:18:58,929 --> 00:19:01,598
[mockingly] "That's impossible."
Ugh, you're such a dweeb.

420
00:19:01,682 --> 00:19:03,183
Why can't you leave us alone?

421
00:19:03,267 --> 00:19:06,353
You don't have enough nostrils
to stuff with wasps?

422
00:19:06,436 --> 00:19:10,149
I don't want just any wasp nostrils,
I want these wasp nostrils.

423
00:19:10,232 --> 00:19:12,192
You're just delaying
the inevitable, Michael.

424
00:19:12,276 --> 00:19:14,736
The Bad Place is going to get
all of them eventually.

425
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:17,072
These four, their loved ones,

426
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:19,783
even your precious pee-pee king,
Doug Forcett.

427
00:19:19,867 --> 00:19:22,619
-Now, why would you think that?
-Just a hunch.

428
00:19:23,328 --> 00:19:25,706
And do you wanna know
what else I had a hunch about?

429
00:19:25,789 --> 00:19:27,124
No.

430
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:32,254
Why let the guy
keep saying mean stuff, right?

431
00:19:32,337 --> 00:19:36,008
I thought Doug Forcett was the blueprint
for leading a good life.

432
00:19:36,091 --> 00:19:39,052
He seems pretty confident
that Doug is heading to the Bad Place.

433
00:19:41,305 --> 00:19:44,766
For a while now, I have felt
like there was something wrong

434
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:47,811
with how the points system
was evaluating humans.

435
00:19:47,895 --> 00:19:51,148
At first, I thought
it was that the system didn't allow

436
00:19:51,231 --> 00:19:53,150
for the possibility
that people could improve.

437
00:19:53,233 --> 00:19:56,570
That's why I convinced the Judge
to send you back to Earth.

438
00:19:56,653 --> 00:19:58,614
So you could
confront the ways you were living.

439
00:19:58,697 --> 00:20:02,326
But, now, I'm worried
that the problems with the system

440
00:20:02,409 --> 00:20:04,828
might be much more serious.

441
00:20:04,912 --> 00:20:08,040
We need to gather some real evidence.

442
00:20:08,123 --> 00:20:11,376
Uh... Sorry... no, no.
Michael, you're confused.

443
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:14,338
Evidence isn't a good thing that you want.

444
00:20:14,421 --> 00:20:17,549
It's a bad thing that you have to destroy,

445
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:19,551
or you go to jail.

446
00:20:19,635 --> 00:20:23,222
Jason, quick, I need that coaster.
Over there, behind the pillar.

447
00:20:23,305 --> 00:20:24,681
You got it, boss.

448
00:20:25,807 --> 00:20:29,061
{\an8}-I just needed a 30-second break.
-Yeah.

449
00:20:29,144 --> 00:20:30,938
{\an8}What sort of evidence is this,
and how do we get it?

450
00:20:31,021 --> 00:20:34,358
{\an8}Janet and I have to go right to the source
of the points themselves.

451
00:20:34,441 --> 00:20:35,692
{\an8}The Accountant's office.

452
00:20:35,776 --> 00:20:39,404
{\an8}The four of you stay here,
at Doug Forcett's house, until I get back.

453
00:20:39,488 --> 00:20:42,366
{\an8}You're gonna need to feed
all the dogs and the wolves.

454
00:20:42,449 --> 00:20:47,829
{\an8}And if a teenager shows up on a dirt bike,
just do as he says. He's very scary.

455
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:51,541
{\an8}Michael! Michael! [panting]
I forgot what you asked me to get.

456
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:53,377
{\an8}That's okay, bud. Thanks, anyway.

457
00:20:53,961 --> 00:20:56,421
{\an8}Look, we won't be long
and you guys should be safe here.

458
00:20:56,505 --> 00:20:57,339
[door opens]

459
00:20:57,422 --> 00:20:58,340
Actually, scratch that.

460
00:20:58,423 --> 00:21:01,009
We're all screwed, 'cause a bunch more
demons just showed up.

461
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:02,094
[Tahani yelps]

462
00:21:02,177 --> 00:21:03,929
[Eleanor] There's too many of 'em.
What do we do?

463
00:21:04,012 --> 00:21:07,266
I have an idea.
I think I can take you into my void.

464
00:21:07,349 --> 00:21:09,476
-That sounds fun! Let's go into a void!
-[Michael] Okay, let's go.

465
00:21:09,559 --> 00:21:10,852
[opens portal]

466
00:21:11,436 --> 00:21:13,647
Just to be clear,
I don't know if you'll survive in my void,

467
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:16,608
but either way, all of you will
definitely die on Earth when I do this.

468
00:21:16,692 --> 00:21:17,734
So, look around and say goodbye.

469
00:21:17,818 --> 00:21:20,153
-Goodbye, Earth!
-Wait, did you just say we're gonna die?
