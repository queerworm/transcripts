This is me and Janet's honeymoon,

so we're gonna go try
and figure out how to have sex.

129
00:06:26,344 --> 00:06:29,305
So I was a hotshot
corporate lawyer in the 1980s.

130
00:06:29,388 --> 00:06:31,390
I only cared about making money
and doing cocaine

131
00:06:31,474 --> 00:06:33,768
and I was pretty crappy to my family
as well.

132
00:06:33,851 --> 00:06:36,854
But one night, I had an epiphany, right?

133
00:06:36,938 --> 00:06:38,940
I needed to do something
good with my life.

134
00:06:39,023 --> 00:06:43,152
So I drew up plans for this foundation
that would help kids all over the world,

135
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:46,030
would advance human rights,
revolutionize agriculture,

136
00:06:46,114 --> 00:06:50,701
and just improve every nation and every
society in every possible way. [chuckles]

137
00:06:50,785 --> 00:06:52,328
You were pretty coked-up, huh?

138
00:06:52,411 --> 00:06:55,498
Oh, yeah, man. I was flying high.
It was so awesome. [laughs]

139
00:06:55,581 --> 00:06:58,334
But you're not gonna believe this,
I followed through.

140
00:06:58,417 --> 00:07:01,504
Yeah, I woke up the next morning,
I went straight to the bank,

141
00:07:01,587 --> 00:07:03,256
I withdrew my life savings,

142
00:07:03,339 --> 00:07:05,633
-and I was gonna start that charity.
-Good for you!

143
00:07:05,716 --> 00:07:08,719
And then I immediately
fell into subway tracks

144
00:07:08,803 --> 00:07:10,930
-and was electrocuted by the third rail.
-Ooh.

145
00:07:11,013 --> 00:07:13,516
Honestly, not the type of rail
I thought was gonna kill me.

146
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:16,436
[chuckles] 'Cause I love cocaine.

147
00:07:17,061 --> 00:07:20,064

I shouldn't... Do you?

148
00:07:20,982 --> 00:07:24,360
-No.
-Oh, yeah. I mean, I was just...

149
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:26,404
I was just kidding. It was just a joke.

150
00:07:27,029 --> 00:07:29,073
I mean, who would want
to do cocaine right now?

151
00:07:36,497 --> 00:07:38,875
-Are you okay?
-Anyway, so after I died,

152
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:42,170
uh, my sister found my plan,
and, uh, she used my money

153
00:07:42,253 --> 00:07:45,840
to start the Mindy St. Clair
Rescue Alliance, yeah.

154
00:07:45,923 --> 00:07:49,010
It's actually the largest relief aid
charity in the world. [chuckles]

155
00:07:49,093 --> 00:07:52,180
Oh, so the question was,
did you get credit

156
00:07:52,263 --> 00:07:54,682
for all those good person points or not?

157
00:07:54,765 --> 00:07:57,560
Exactly. I don't know how long
my case was pending or whatever,

158
00:07:57,643 --> 00:08:01,856
but when I woke up, the two sides had been
fighting about me for a long time.

159
00:08:01,939 --> 00:08:04,025

to this compromise, you know?

-Well, it beats being tortured.
-Hmm.

I was about to turn myself in.

00:08:15,036 --> 00:08:16,496
No.

166
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:20,374
Yeah, there's no time
for that morality nonsense, sweetheart.

167
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:23,503
This is about survival.
You gotta look out for number one.

168
00:08:24,545 --> 00:08:29,091
Right, well, we don't have proof
that it doesn't cure Alzheimer's.

169
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:32,386
Eleanor, we've got a surprise for you!

170
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:34,347
Yeah, thanks, but I brought my own cake.

171
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:37,183
Oh, I know you've only
worked here a few weeks,

172
00:08:37,266 --> 00:08:40,144
but we have this little office tradition
where we all pitch in, and then we--

173
00:08:40,228 --> 00:08:43,064
Yeah, no, I get it. It's just,
I know what kind of cake I like.

174
00:08:43,147 --> 00:08:45,942
Plus, it's Lisa's birthday next week,
and if I let you give me a cake,

175
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:47,860
that means I gotta pitch in
to get Lisa a cake

176
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:49,904
and sing to her and wear
one of those dumb hats

177
00:08:49,987 --> 00:08:52,073
you all are wearing right now. No, thanks.

178
00:08:52,156 --> 00:08:56,160
This way, I don't owe you anything,
you don't owe me anything. Later.

179
00:08:57,703 --> 00:08:59,080
What were we talking about?

180
00:08:59,163 --> 00:09:01,916
What is her deal? Why is she like this?

181
00:09:01,999 --> 00:09:05,795
I don't know, but the meaner she is,
the more it turns me on. Is that weird?

182
00:09:05,878 --> 00:09:08,798
-You're my boss.
-Oh, say that to me again,

183
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:10,925
but more disgusted with me,
like I'm a worm.

184
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:15,596
Eleanor was supposed to be
in The Bad Place,

185
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,181
arrived here by accident,

186
00:09:17,265 --> 00:09:20,059
assumed another person's identity,
and has now escaped.

187
00:09:20,142 --> 00:09:22,520
Is that the whole story?

188
00:09:22,603 --> 00:09:27,108
Well, no. Someone else
was sent here by mistake.

189
00:09:27,191 --> 00:09:30,736
His name is Jason Mendoza, and I believe
he's on the train with Eleanor.

190
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,321
You knew about Jason?

191
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:35,157
Yes, I know that he's a fake

192
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:36,534
and that he's married to Janet

193
00:09:36,617 --> 00:09:38,744
and that this entire neighborhood is...

194
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:40,830
What's the human expression?

195
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:43,749
Uh, yes, a smokin' hot turd.

196
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:45,751
[Shawn] I will deal
with Jason Mendoza later.

197
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:47,920
For now, I will hear
your arguments for why

198
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:50,548
Fake Eleanor Shellstrop
should stay in The Good Place.

199
00:09:50,631 --> 00:09:53,634
We can do this,
but we must remain emotionless.

200
00:09:53,718 --> 00:09:56,095
I'm talking "Kristen Stewart
on a red carpet"

201
00:09:56,178 --> 00:09:59,181
level of emotionless here, all right?
[exhales deeply]

202
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:00,266
Begin.

203
00:10:00,349 --> 00:10:03,144
Eleanor dedicated herself
to the study of ethics.

204
00:10:03,227 --> 00:10:05,855
I was blown away by her capacity
for self-improvement.

205
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:09,275
Eleanor is a magnificent person who has
grown tremendously in her time here.

206
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,235
Please, I'm begging you, please.

207
00:10:11,319 --> 00:10:14,113
Voluntarily heading
to The Bad Place proves

208
00:10:14,196 --> 00:10:15,906
that she is a selfless person.

209
00:10:16,741 --> 00:10:19,076
Sorry. I'm getting choked up.

210
00:10:19,702 --> 00:10:22,788
[sighs] Yes,
voluntarily sacrificing herself

211
00:10:22,913 --> 00:10:25,291
and heading to The Bad Place
would be a point in her favor.

212
00:10:25,374 --> 00:10:27,877
However, I've just received word
that Eleanor is not currently

213
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:30,671
in The Bad Place.
We have no idea where she is.

214
00:10:30,755 --> 00:10:31,589
-Well, what the...
-What?

215
00:10:31,672 --> 00:10:33,299
Fork! [sighs]

216
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:38,471
I will now review Eleanor's memories.

217
00:10:38,554 --> 00:10:40,139
Her memories? As in, all the things

218
00:10:40,222 --> 00:10:41,599
-she's done on Earth?
-Mmm.

219
00:10:41,682 --> 00:10:43,643
But perhaps we could
take a little break first.

220
00:10:43,726 --> 00:10:46,354
You know, we've been at it
for a while, and you must be tired.

221
00:10:46,437 --> 00:10:48,814
I've been asleep in goo
for the last 29 years, so I'm good.

222
00:10:48,898 --> 00:10:51,484
Call up the screen
for Fake Eleanor Shellstrop, please.

223
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:55,696
Where should we begin,
"Waiters Screamed At"

224
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:58,282
or "Cyberbullying of Pregnant Woman
from Spin Class"?

225
00:11:03,454 --> 00:11:04,622
[door closes]

226
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:07,708
Hey, you wanna grab a drink or something?

227
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:11,087
Uh, no, I kind of have
my own private time routine.

228
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:13,589
I thought you'd want company
after being here alone for so long.

229
00:11:14,382 --> 00:11:16,842
-No.
-Okay, I get it.

230
00:11:16,926 --> 00:11:18,511
Hey, uh, where did you get that?

231
00:11:18,594 --> 00:11:20,763
That's not one of my books.

232
00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:23,307
I only have Anne Rice vampire novels
with water stains,

233
00:11:23,391 --> 00:11:26,060
and I've cut words out of most of them
to make pornography.

234
00:11:26,143 --> 00:11:29,021
My friend in The Good Place gave it to me
when he was teaching me ethics.

235
00:11:29,105 --> 00:11:30,398
-[sighs]
-It reminds me of him.

236
00:11:30,481 --> 00:11:32,191
Look, if you wanna survive,

237
00:11:32,274 --> 00:11:35,403
you have to forget what you left behind.
Take that whole experience,

238
00:11:35,486 --> 00:11:38,781
crumple it up, throw it
in the garbage can. [clicks tongue]

239
00:11:40,574 --> 00:11:42,451
Okay. Instead of reading,

240
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:47,873
I will watch this VHS copy
of <i>Cannonball Run II.</i>

241
00:11:47,957 --> 00:11:52,169
Or maybe the making of <i>Cannonball Run II.</i>

242
00:11:52,253 --> 00:11:54,880
-Wow. Very medium.
-Yeah.

243
00:11:55,756 --> 00:11:58,217
Hey, you two lovebirds
figure out how to have sex yet?

244
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:00,136
No. We tried for two hours,

245
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:02,555
but there was just a lot of, like,
bumping into each other.

246
00:12:02,638 --> 00:12:04,223
It was weird.

247
00:12:07,101 --> 00:12:09,145
[speaking Spanish]

248
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:13,190
-[horn blows]
-[all gasp]

249
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:15,651
This ain't your Bar Mitzvah
anymore, bitch.

250
00:12:15,734 --> 00:12:20,364
It's my 24th birthday! What!
Hot tiara, girl.

251
00:12:20,448 --> 00:12:21,449
[horn blows]

252
00:12:21,699 --> 00:12:23,868
That was "The Crashing
and Subsequent Destruction

253
00:12:23,951 --> 00:12:25,703
"of Vanessa Garcia's <i>quinceañera."</i>

254
00:12:25,786 --> 00:12:27,413
Let's move on to another event.

255
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:30,666
"Heckling of Mall Santas"?

256
00:12:30,749 --> 00:12:34,170
"Lifetime Ban from Build-a-Bear Workshop"?

257
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:38,007
"Brief Instagram Flirtation
with Kid Rock"? Oh, no.

258
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:40,759
This is getting away from us.
We need to do something quickly.

259
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:45,389
Yeah, Judge, request permission
to speak somewhat emotionally?

260
00:12:45,473 --> 00:12:47,224
Ugh. Fine.

261
00:12:47,308 --> 00:12:48,601
Dramamine.

262
00:12:48,684 --> 00:12:50,603
Helps with the nausea. Proceed.

263
00:12:50,686 --> 00:12:54,773
Okay, look, I know, obviously,
these memories aren't great.

264
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:58,277
I was particularly disturbed
by "Started Fire in Mailbox

265
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,904
"to Get Mailman to Take Off Shirt,"

266
00:12:59,987 --> 00:13:03,324
but that was the old Eleanor. She changed.

267
00:13:03,407 --> 00:13:06,452
She worked, and she studied,
and she got better.

268
00:13:06,535 --> 00:13:11,040
And it wasn't just self-preservation,
it was real self-improvement.

269
00:13:11,123 --> 00:13:14,835
I made the decision to help Eleanor
that first week, and I'm glad I did.

270
00:13:15,586 --> 00:13:17,004
Because she's worth it.

271
00:13:17,087 --> 00:13:18,881
I, too, helped Eleanor.

272
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:21,258
Not as much as Chidi, surely,

273
00:13:21,342 --> 00:13:24,970
but my help was more friendship
and sorely needed fashion advice.

274
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:27,223
Eleanor deserves to stay.

275
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:31,769
Thank you for these testimonials.
A ruling has been reached.

276
00:13:36,524 --> 00:13:39,902
Oh, you want to hear it.
I forgot how needy humans are.

277
00:13:39,985 --> 00:13:42,988
[clears throat]
Eleanor Shellstrop is a bad person.

278
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:45,991
The progress she has made
does not offset her actions on Earth.

279
00:13:46,116 --> 00:13:47,826
She deserves to be in The Bad Place.

280
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:50,162
-Oh.
-As concerning Jason Mendoza,

281
00:13:50,246 --> 00:13:53,082
I have heard no statements
nor seen any evidence to suggest--

282
00:13:53,165 --> 00:13:55,000
Oh, he's from Florida?

283
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:57,378
Yeah, he belongs in The Bad Place.

284
00:13:57,461 --> 00:14:00,381
No, but how do you intend
to enforce this ruling?

285
00:14:00,464 --> 00:14:03,509
-You have no idea where they are.
-Bad Janet?

286
00:14:03,592 --> 00:14:04,969
What's up, fork nuts?

287
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:06,929
Engage walkie-talkie protocol.

288
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:09,223
[electronic whirring]

289
00:14:11,308 --> 00:14:13,394
What if you're here, and I'm like this?

290
00:14:13,477 --> 00:14:15,563
Yes, that may work.

291
00:14:15,646 --> 00:14:17,273
[electronic chiming]

292
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:20,150
Whoa. What is happening?

293
00:14:20,234 --> 00:14:22,528
Is she having an orgasm?
Did I do it somehow?

294
00:14:22,611 --> 00:14:25,197
[Shawn] <i>Attention Eleanor Shellstrop</i>
<i>and Jason Mendoza.</i>

295
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:27,408
This is the Almighty Judge
on High of All Beings

296
00:14:27,491 --> 00:14:30,035
Living and Dead for All Eternity.
My name's Shawn.

297
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:33,497
<i>We do not know where you are,</i>
<i>but hope you are receiving this message.</i>

298
00:14:33,581 --> 00:14:36,208
<i>You have been found to be </i>
<i>the rightful property of The Bad Place.</i>

299
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:38,085
<i>Either return</i>
<i>to your original neighborhood,</i>

300
00:14:38,168 --> 00:14:41,422
<i>or your accomplices Chidi Anagonye</i>
<i>and Tahani Al-Jamil</i>

301
00:14:41,505 --> 00:14:42,882
will go to The Bad Place in your stead.

302
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:46,260
-[both] What?
-You have four hours. Goodbye.

303
00:14:46,343 --> 00:14:50,306
Your Honor, please,
Chidi and Tahani are completely innocent.

304
00:14:50,431 --> 00:14:53,183
They are not completely innocent.
They told me so themselves.

305
00:14:53,267 --> 00:14:57,938
They aided and abetted two criminals,
one of whom was a DJ.

306
00:14:58,397 --> 00:15:00,983
They're gonna send Chidi and Tahani
to The Bad Place?

307
00:15:02,318 --> 00:15:04,486
We're off the hook, this is amazing!

308
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:07,990
Babe, we are going to be trying
to make love all night long.

309
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:17,583
We don't have to go back, though.
They just said.

310
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:21,712
We can't let Tahani and Chidi
go to The Bad Place. They're our friends.

311
00:15:21,795 --> 00:15:23,881
We literally owe it to them.

312
00:15:23,964 --> 00:15:26,008
If they're really our "friends",

313
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:28,469
then why aren't they here
with us right "now"?

314
00:15:28,552 --> 00:15:31,138
Because we ran away. Are you...

315
00:15:31,221 --> 00:15:34,266
[stammers] Does your brain work, actually?

316
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:36,060
Do you have a functioning head?

317
00:15:36,143 --> 00:15:37,519
[Mindy] I think he has a good point.

318
00:15:37,895 --> 00:15:39,438
I wouldn't go back for those turkeys.

319
00:15:39,521 --> 00:15:41,065
How can you say that?

320
00:15:41,148 --> 00:15:42,358
Think practically here.

321
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:46,195
Okay, you go back, you turn yourself in,
you get sent to The Bad Place,

322
00:15:46,278 --> 00:15:47,488
and you never see your friends again.

323
00:15:47,571 --> 00:15:51,241
Or you stay here, you're safe
from The Bad Place,

324
00:15:51,325 --> 00:15:52,826
and you never see your friends again.

325
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:54,036
It's the same results,

326
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:56,330
except if you stay here,
you don't get tortured.

327
00:15:56,413 --> 00:15:58,874
-But they do.
-That's their problem.

328
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:01,710
Your problem is whether you get tortured.

329
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:04,254
Now if you'll excuse me,

330
00:16:04,338 --> 00:16:06,048
it's my masturbating time. [clears throat]

331
00:16:06,131 --> 00:16:08,092
When isn't it? We're going back.

332
00:16:08,175 --> 00:16:09,927
-But--
-Now.

333
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:14,723
[Eleanor] Can we even
make it there in time?

334
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:16,850
I believe so, though it'll be close.

335
00:16:16,934 --> 00:16:18,352
-Where's Jason?
-[Jason] Heads up!

336
00:16:18,435 --> 00:16:20,646
Sorry, Eleanor, but I can't let us leave.

337
00:16:20,729 --> 00:16:22,564
Bortles!

338
00:16:24,441 --> 00:16:25,734
No!

339
00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:31,198
What are you doing, you goon?

340
00:16:31,281 --> 00:16:32,533
Trying to blow up the train.

341
00:16:32,616 --> 00:16:35,035
Blowing stuff up got me
out of so many jams on Earth.

342
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:37,079
Let me try again.
Do you have another bottle?

343
00:16:37,788 --> 00:16:38,872
[beeping]

344
00:16:38,956 --> 00:16:41,458
Hi, there. Since there's
no Janet here to serve you,

345
00:16:41,542 --> 00:16:43,377
I brought you two a little treat.

346
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:47,089
-Uh, kind of like a last meal.
-Not like a last meal,

347
00:16:47,172 --> 00:16:50,259
just the... The final food
you might ever eat.

348
00:16:51,927 --> 00:16:55,305
I'm gonna miss these little perks
when I'm down in The Bad Place.

349
00:16:55,389 --> 00:16:56,890
Being forced to wear a...

350
00:16:56,974 --> 00:17:00,227
A knock-off handbag and drink tap water.

351
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:02,855
-That's what you think Hell is?
-[groans]

352
00:17:03,647 --> 00:17:05,357
Janet, please, we have to go.

353
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:08,402
I won't start the train
until my husband says it's okay.

354
00:17:08,485 --> 00:17:11,447
I'm sorry, Eleanor, but I engaged
a ride-or-die protocol

355
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:13,323
so I'm loyal to Jason forever.

356
00:17:14,825 --> 00:17:15,826
[Eleanor] Buddy...

357
00:17:17,661 --> 00:17:19,371
Come on, we gotta go.

358
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:23,959
I don't wanna go to The Bad Place.
It's scary, like the movie <i>Ratatouille.</i>

359
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:25,419
-What?
-Yo, I ain't trying

360
00:17:25,502 --> 00:17:27,546
to have rats living
in my hat and pulling my hair

361
00:17:27,629 --> 00:17:29,006
to get me to do stuff.

362
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:31,550
I'm scared, too.

363
00:17:32,217 --> 00:17:35,512
But we can't just abandon our friends
and let them take the fall for us.

364
00:17:35,596 --> 00:17:38,390
Sure we can.
It would be so easy to do that.

365
00:17:38,474 --> 00:17:40,517
We'd just go back
to Mindy's house, chill out--

366
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:42,394
I'd get used to room-temperature beer.

367
00:17:42,478 --> 00:17:44,104
Me and Janet keep trying
to solve the problem

368
00:17:44,188 --> 00:17:46,940
of how to have sex,
which could take years.

369
00:17:47,024 --> 00:17:50,819
Let's just pretend that we didn't hear
the Janet walkie-talkie message.

370
00:17:53,197 --> 00:17:55,532
No, it's time to own up, dude.

371
00:17:55,616 --> 00:17:59,745
I spent my whole life acting like Mindy,
me first, no matter what,

372
00:17:59,828 --> 00:18:03,665
and it literally took dying
and being around a bunch of good people

373
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:06,376
to realize that I was kind of a nightmare.

374
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:08,962
-Why were you like that?
-Well...

375
00:18:09,338 --> 00:18:12,716
Let me tell you about
Doug and Donna Shellstrop.

376
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:15,928
Hey, Dad, just a warning,
Mom's gonna be here in a second.

377
00:18:16,011 --> 00:18:19,515
[scoffs] Your mother's coming?
Oh, boy, hide the silverware.

378
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:20,432
You mean the silverware

379
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:21,850
-you stole from Mom?
-[door opens and closes]

380
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:23,519
Yeah, but she keeps trying
to steal it back.

381
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:27,648
I drove here as fast as I could.
You scored free WrestleMania tickets?

382
00:18:27,731 --> 00:18:30,442
There are no tickets, Mom. I knew that was
the only way I could get you here.

383
00:18:30,526 --> 00:18:32,194
A-ha! Burn.

384
00:18:32,277 --> 00:18:35,114
Eleanor, just because your father and I
are divorced

385
00:18:35,197 --> 00:18:37,324
does not mean
you can disrespect me like this, okay?

386
00:18:37,407 --> 00:18:39,118
We are a family.

387
00:18:39,576 --> 00:18:40,702
Whose birthday is it?

388
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:43,539
-Mine.
-[Doug] Are you serious? No way.

389
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:46,333
That was a BS foul on Chapman.

390
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:48,252
And since you both forgot,
again, which means

391
00:18:48,335 --> 00:18:50,796
you definitely didn't
get me a present, again,

392
00:18:50,879 --> 00:18:53,549
I got myself something.
I just need you to sign it.

393
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:56,802
Emancipation papers? Honey!

394
00:18:56,885 --> 00:18:59,179
What does "emancipation" mean?

395
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:00,806
It means I'll be on my own.

396
00:19:00,889 --> 00:19:04,268
All my life, I've been taking
care of myself and you guys.

397
00:19:04,351 --> 00:19:06,186
I work two after-school jobs
because you blew

398
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:08,438
half my college fund bailing
your boyfriend out of jail.

399
00:19:08,522 --> 00:19:09,982
So irresponsible.

400
00:19:10,065 --> 00:19:11,817
And you blew the other half
trying to frame her boyfriend.

401
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:16,113
It was so stupid.
He was already guilty, dumbass.

402
00:19:16,196 --> 00:19:17,614
I've been on my own
for a while now anyway,

403
00:19:17,698 --> 00:19:20,409
and after you sign these papers,
it'll be official.

404
00:19:20,492 --> 00:19:22,786
I won't owe you anything,
you won't owe me anything.

405
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:25,998
Well, if you want me to sign...
Oh, that's a joint.

406
00:19:26,081 --> 00:19:28,250
Uh, do you have a pen or a lighter?

407
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:32,337
You're a really interesting
person, Eleanor.

408
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:34,173
We should hang out sometime.

409
00:19:34,298 --> 00:19:35,883
[slurping]

410
00:19:41,305 --> 00:19:43,473
Wow, your parents sucked.

411
00:19:43,557 --> 00:19:45,058
Yeah, they did.

412
00:19:45,934 --> 00:19:48,061
And I've been using
their crappy parenting as an excuse

413
00:19:48,145 --> 00:19:50,522
for my selfish behavior all my life.

414
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,482
No more.

415
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:56,278
We know what's right here.
We have to go back.

416
00:20:01,158 --> 00:20:02,492
Ride-or-die.

417
00:20:04,077 --> 00:20:05,495
-[electronic beeping]
-[train engine starts]

418
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:12,127
[timer beeping]

419
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:13,712
Time is up.

420
00:20:13,795 --> 00:20:16,006
In preparation for your trip
to The Bad Place,

421
00:20:16,089 --> 00:20:17,758
please put on these fedoras.

422
00:20:17,841 --> 00:20:19,009
Oh, no.

423
00:20:19,092 --> 00:20:22,012
Well, no use delaying the inevitable.

424
00:20:23,013 --> 00:20:25,599
-We surrender. Together.
-[door opens]

425
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:29,102
Chidi, Tahani,
we're back to save your souls.

426
00:20:29,186 --> 00:20:30,646
-[door closes]
-[Eleanor pants]

427
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:33,440
Real weird vibe in here.

428
00:20:34,524 --> 00:20:36,610
Was definitely expecting some applause.

429
00:20:36,693 --> 00:20:40,113
You're too late.
You... You missed the cut-off.

430
00:20:40,322 --> 00:20:44,117
But we're here. We came here
as fast as we could, and we're here.

431
00:20:44,201 --> 00:20:45,327
So...

432
00:20:46,036 --> 00:20:47,120
Now what?

433
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:50,582
{\an8}[sighs wearily]

434
00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:54,086
{\an8}What is the most logical decision?

435
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:56,088
{\an8}I made my initial ruling.

436
00:20:56,171 --> 00:20:58,882
{\an8}I established a deadline.
The deadline was missed.

437
00:20:58,966 --> 00:21:00,717
{\an8}Now the original perpetrators are here.

438
00:21:00,801 --> 00:21:02,135
{\an8}Ugh.

439
00:21:02,219 --> 00:21:03,512
{\an8}This is exhausting.

440
00:21:03,595 --> 00:21:06,014
{\an8}I just want to go back to
my container of goo and go to sleep.

441
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:08,141
{\an8}The Bad Place is owed two people.

442
00:21:08,225 --> 00:21:11,061
{\an8}In my opinion, which is
an objective fact in this case

443
00:21:11,144 --> 00:21:12,521
{\an8}and all cases always and forever,

444
00:21:12,604 --> 00:21:15,649
{\an8}you have all done bad things
since you arrived here.

445
00:21:15,732 --> 00:21:18,026
{\an8}Therefore, I don't care
which two of you go.

446
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:21,029
{\an8}You can decide. You have 30 minutes.

447
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:22,531
[beeping]
