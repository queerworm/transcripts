1
00:00:01,418 --> 00:00:04,671
Now, I'm about to show you
some very sensitive information.

2
00:00:04,879 --> 00:00:07,799
The final point totals
each of you achieved

3
00:00:08,008 --> 00:00:09,509
for all your actions on Earth.

4
00:00:12,262 --> 00:00:15,181
Whoa, your point total
was crazy high, Eleanor.

5
00:00:15,473 --> 00:00:18,685
[laughs] Oh, sorry, "Crazy High Eleanor"
was my nickname in college.

6
00:00:18,768 --> 00:00:21,229
I accidentally saw
these point totals when Michael

7
00:00:21,312 --> 00:00:24,149
was fixing the sinkhole.
It gave me an idea.

8
00:00:24,232 --> 00:00:27,235
We will apply the formula
to Eleanor's actions here

9
00:00:27,318 --> 00:00:30,030
in The Good Place,
and if you earn enough new points,

10
00:00:30,113 --> 00:00:31,531
then we could argue
that you should stay here.

11
00:00:31,906 --> 00:00:33,366
-Would that work?
-[Michael] Don't know,

12
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:36,953
never had to prove someone
belonged here before.

13
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:40,749
But the judge will be here soon, and this
is the best way to build our case.

14
00:00:40,832 --> 00:00:42,876
Now, the average point total

15
00:00:42,959 --> 00:00:45,879
for a resident here
is roughly 1.2 million.

16
00:00:46,212 --> 00:00:49,299
Right now, based on everything
that you did on Earth,

17
00:00:49,382 --> 00:00:52,594
you have -4,008.

18
00:00:52,677 --> 00:00:54,471
That's not great,

19
00:00:55,513 --> 00:00:57,182
but I'm gonna do nice things

20
00:00:57,265 --> 00:01:00,810
for every goober in this place
until my point total is so high

21
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:03,021
I can rub it in all their smug faces.

22
00:01:03,688 --> 00:01:05,565
-[beeps]
-You just lost five points.

23
00:01:13,782 --> 00:01:15,867
-Hello!
-Hi, how are you?

24
00:01:17,243 --> 00:01:21,206
{\an8}There has to be something bigger I can do
than holding the door and waving.

25
00:01:21,289 --> 00:01:24,042
{\an8}There's no way every Walmart greeter
is in The Good Place.

26
00:01:24,375 --> 00:01:25,668
{\an8}"Walmart"?

27
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:28,129
{\an8}It's a place regular people go.

28
00:01:28,213 --> 00:01:30,423
{\an8}-You haven't heard of it.
-Look, I know this is tedious,

29
00:01:30,507 --> 00:01:32,300
{\an8}but holding a door for someone
is three points,

30
00:01:32,383 --> 00:01:34,010
{\an8}and if you do it for everyone
in the neighborhood,

31
00:01:34,093 --> 00:01:36,221
{\an8}then that's almost 1,000 points
for just a start.

32
00:01:36,471 --> 00:01:39,516
{\an8}Besides, all the big-ticket items
are impossible, I'm afraid.

33
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:41,059
{\an8}It's not as if you could,

34
00:01:41,142 --> 00:01:43,019
{\an8}you know,
"sacrifice your life to save others"

35
00:01:43,102 --> 00:01:44,938
{\an8}or "change the consciousness of a nation."

36
00:01:46,064 --> 00:01:47,982
{\an8}Both of which I did, by the way. Such fun.

37
00:01:48,691 --> 00:01:50,026
{\an8}Have a wonderful day.

38
00:01:51,152 --> 00:01:52,904
{\an8}This is pointless!

39
00:01:53,154 --> 00:01:56,741
{\an8}The ticker isn't even going up,
and everyone's giving me the stink eye.

40
00:01:57,492 --> 00:02:00,703
{\an8}Eleanor, everyone hates you.

41
00:02:01,204 --> 00:02:02,372
Well, fork you too.

42
00:02:02,455 --> 00:02:04,124
{\an8}No, this is good.

43
00:02:04,207 --> 00:02:07,001
{\an8}Now that we know, we can
actually do something about it.

44
00:02:07,085 --> 00:02:10,004
{\an8}And I am an expert at mediating conflict,

45
00:02:10,088 --> 00:02:12,298
{\an8}like when my friends
Scary, Sporty, Posh, and Baby

46
00:02:12,382 --> 00:02:15,093
{\an8}had an issue with my other friend,
Archbishop Desmond Tutu.

47
00:02:16,177 --> 00:02:18,388
Yeah, I don't know what I love more

48
00:02:18,471 --> 00:02:22,016
about our morning hard-boiled egg routine,
the eggs or the routine.

49
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:26,980
[chuckles] Um, actually, this morning,
there's a little surprise in yours.

50
00:02:28,857 --> 00:02:29,858
[gasps]

51
00:02:33,361 --> 00:02:35,238
"I love you." How cute.

52
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:37,949
I love you too, egg.

53
00:02:38,741 --> 00:02:42,537
Oh, no. No, Chidi,
that's me saying that to you.

54
00:02:43,121 --> 00:02:44,122
I love you.

55
00:02:46,791 --> 00:02:49,210
Oh...

56
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:54,340
Well, that is something.

57
00:02:54,424 --> 00:02:55,967
I know you've gone through a lot,

58
00:02:56,175 --> 00:02:58,136
and now I'm throwing this at you,
but I just...

59
00:02:58,219 --> 00:03:00,430
I had to tell you how I feel.

60
00:03:00,513 --> 00:03:02,765
I love you. No need to respond.

61
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:05,268
-Great.
-Well, at some point,

62
00:03:05,351 --> 00:03:07,145
you'll respond, right?

63
00:03:07,228 --> 00:03:09,689
I just meant no rush.

64
00:03:09,772 --> 00:03:11,316
You wanna talk about eggs again?

65
00:03:13,192 --> 00:03:14,319
[laughs forcedly]

66
00:03:18,448 --> 00:03:20,283
Mmm... This isn't right.

67
00:03:20,366 --> 00:03:22,869
I'm sorry,
I've never kissed anyone before.

68
00:03:22,952 --> 00:03:25,455
Is one tongue okay?
I can add more tongues.

69
00:03:25,538 --> 00:03:27,040
No, that's not it.

70
00:03:27,123 --> 00:03:29,918
We're married now,
but we still haven't told your dad.

71
00:03:30,001 --> 00:03:33,463
Once again, Michael is not my dad,
and we shouldn't tell him.

72
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:35,173
If Michael finds out that we're married,

73
00:03:35,256 --> 00:03:37,133
then he'll know
you're not Tahani's soulmate,

74
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:40,720
and then he'll know
that you're really Jason and not Jianyu.

75
00:03:40,803 --> 00:03:42,222
He'd send you to The Bad Place.

76
00:03:42,764 --> 00:03:44,432
Hmm, I don't want to lose you, girl.

77
00:03:44,515 --> 00:03:45,934
-I'm not a girl.
-But also,

78
00:03:46,017 --> 00:03:48,603
I'm tired of living a lie.
We gotta go public.

79
00:03:48,686 --> 00:03:50,438
I hate all this hiding.

80
00:03:50,521 --> 00:03:52,899
I want us to have the life we deserve.

81
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:57,320
Pillboi, let's talk big picture.

82
00:03:57,403 --> 00:03:58,821
You know I love Jacksonville.

83
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:00,823
J-town.

84
00:04:01,115 --> 00:04:03,076
It's easily one of the top ten
swamp cities

85
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:05,536
in northeastern Florida,
but if we're gonna make it

86
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:08,164
in the DJ game, we gotta get to Miami.

87
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:10,667
Oh, yeah, but Miami's expensive.

88
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,585
We just don't got that skrilla, B.

89
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:14,796
I mean, I got ten bucks to my name,

90
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:16,506
and I spent eight of it on this burrito,

91
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:17,924
and the other two on guac.

92
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:19,717
I know what we gotta do.

93
00:04:21,052 --> 00:04:22,971
We're gonna rob this restaurant.

94
00:04:23,054 --> 00:04:24,222
Great idea!

95
00:04:24,597 --> 00:04:25,765
But what if we get caught?

96
00:04:25,848 --> 00:04:29,477
Then we'll just get married, so that
no one can testify against us.

97
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,853
Dope!

98
00:04:31,354 --> 00:04:34,816
Yo... I got diarrhea, I'll be right back.

99
00:04:34,899 --> 00:04:36,359
Me too. I'll race you.

100
00:04:36,442 --> 00:04:38,069
[both laughing] Best friends!

101
00:04:39,195 --> 00:04:42,407
Thank you all for participating
in our focus group for Fake Eleanor.

102
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:44,117
Think of this as an open forum

103
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:47,287
for you to air any and all grievances
that you may carry against her.

104
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:51,624
I was flying on the second day,
and when you caused the trash storm,

105
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:54,794
I crashed into a rotting turkey carcass,
and it exploded.

106
00:04:54,877 --> 00:04:56,045
-Oh, dear.
-All this

107
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:58,298
cartilage and bone
got tangled up in my hair,

108
00:04:58,381 --> 00:04:59,841
and its skin was all over my skin.

109
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:03,303
I didn't know where I ended
and the turkey carcass began.

110
00:05:04,178 --> 00:05:07,765
Well, if it makes you feel any better,
your skin looks amazing.

111
00:05:08,558 --> 00:05:10,685
My cafe got destroyed by the giant frog,

112
00:05:10,768 --> 00:05:13,187
then I reopened it
and it fell into the sinkhole.

113
00:05:14,063 --> 00:05:16,065
Just like me. I fell in, too.

114
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:17,775
Who else feels that Eleanor has ruined

115
00:05:17,859 --> 00:05:19,652
every moment of your existence
since you arrived?

116
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:24,574
Excellent. I must confer with Eleanor
for a tick,

117
00:05:24,657 --> 00:05:27,035
so please, just enjoy the lemonade
and cookies.

118
00:05:28,578 --> 00:05:31,664
It seems everyone's problem with me is me.

119
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:33,374
Yes, it would appear that way.

120
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:35,626
The last moment they were happy
was at my party.

121
00:05:37,128 --> 00:05:39,338
We have to recreate that party.

122
00:05:39,422 --> 00:05:41,883
We have to take them back
to that night before I started

123
00:05:41,966 --> 00:05:44,343
affecting the neighborhood,
and give them a fresh start.

124
00:05:44,469 --> 00:05:46,220
Yes, of course.

125
00:05:46,304 --> 00:05:48,347
We must throw the perfect party,

126
00:05:48,431 --> 00:05:50,850
or else you'll be tortured
by demons forever.

127
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:53,478
This will be the fourth most important
party I have ever thrown.

128
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:57,356
Janet, there you are.

129
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,610
Some residents are complaining
that you're not responding...

130
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:03,112
I'm sorry, what's going on?

131
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:04,864
Is that a wedding ring?

132
00:06:04,947 --> 00:06:06,240
Yes.

133
00:06:06,324 --> 00:06:07,492
I'm married.

134
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:11,788
-To whom?
-Sorry, my protocol forbids me

135
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:15,708
from telling you any private information
about any resident.

136
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:18,711
Is it that person?

137
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:23,216
Jianyu, the man standing right there,
also wearing a wedding band?

138
00:06:23,299 --> 00:06:24,509
Dad...

139
00:06:25,676 --> 00:06:27,011
We need to talk.

140
00:06:31,599 --> 00:06:33,601
I just want to make sure
that I have this right.

141
00:06:33,684 --> 00:06:37,605
Uh, Jianyu is not a Taiwanese monk,

142
00:06:37,688 --> 00:06:41,275
but rather someone named Jason Mendoza,

143
00:06:41,359 --> 00:06:44,612
a failed DJ from Jacksonville, Florida.

144
00:06:44,695 --> 00:06:46,531
I wasn't a failed DJ,

145
00:06:46,614 --> 00:06:48,449
I was pre-successful.

146
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:51,285
And you two are married.

147
00:06:51,369 --> 00:06:53,454
Hells yeah, homey. We love each other.

148
00:06:53,955 --> 00:06:55,665
She makes the bass drop...

149
00:06:56,124 --> 00:06:57,416
In my heart.

150
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,877
And Jason is a person who was near me,

151
00:07:00,128 --> 00:07:01,462
and then he asked me to marry him,

152
00:07:01,546 --> 00:07:03,548
and there is nothing in my protocol

153
00:07:03,673 --> 00:07:06,008
that specifically barred that
from happening.

154
00:07:06,384 --> 00:07:08,636
-So I agreed.
-Love you too, babe.

155
00:07:11,472 --> 00:07:12,807
[sighing]

156
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:14,475
Janet.

157
00:07:15,017 --> 00:07:16,602
Please tell me
how this could have happened.

158
00:07:16,686 --> 00:07:19,689
Unclear. As you know,
each time I am updated,

159
00:07:19,772 --> 00:07:21,441
I accrue new knowledge and abilities.

160
00:07:21,524 --> 00:07:25,570
My suspicion is that when I was rebooted,
I bonded with Jason in a way

161
00:07:25,653 --> 00:07:27,864
that I have never bonded
with anyone before.

162
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:30,324
I seem to have gained
a new understanding of love.

163
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:33,369
I also learned how to do this.

164
00:07:36,205 --> 00:07:38,374
I will speak to you later.
Go to your void.

165
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:39,584
-Okay.
-[tone chimes]

166
00:07:39,667 --> 00:07:40,877
-No, Janet, come back!
-[tone chimes]

167
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,086
-Hi there.
-Go.

168
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:43,212
-Sure thing.
-[tone chimes]

169
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:44,297
-No!
-Stop doing that.

170
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:45,590
-[tone chimes]
-Me?

171
00:07:45,673 --> 00:07:46,674
-Go!
-Goodbye.

172
00:07:46,757 --> 00:07:48,634
-Janet, come back.
-I love you.

173
00:07:48,843 --> 00:07:49,969
I love you too!

174
00:07:51,762 --> 00:07:53,639
That is Sachveer,

175
00:07:53,723 --> 00:07:57,226
and his problem with me is...

176
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:59,020
Oh, one of the giraffes tried to hump him.

177
00:07:59,228 --> 00:08:02,023
[snickers] It's gonna be hard
to keep a straight face tonight.

178
00:08:02,565 --> 00:08:04,233
Hey, can I ask your advice on something?

179
00:08:05,067 --> 00:08:06,235
Are you sure, dude?

180
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:08,905
Isn't there someone else better
you could ask,

181
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:11,365
like literally anyone else?

182
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:15,119
Well, it's a sensitive matter, and you...
You do know me pretty well.

183
00:08:15,203 --> 00:08:18,706
So, here it is.
Real Eleanor said she loves me.

184
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:21,918
Hey, man, nice pull. She's a great person.

185
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:23,252
I don't know what to do.

186
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:27,131
I mean, we are soulmates,
so I probably do love her,

187
00:08:27,215 --> 00:08:30,343
but then again, how do I know
if my motivation is correct?

188
00:08:30,426 --> 00:08:32,261
Maybe I think I'm supposed to love her,

189
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:34,931
but if I tell her that I love her for the
wrong reasons, it won't mean anything.

190
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:36,516
You have a tendency to over-think things.

191
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:40,728
Turn off that giant brain,
and just say you love her too.

192
00:08:41,562 --> 00:08:43,105
-You think?
-If this were some

193
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:45,441
random person you hooked up with
at a Diamondbacks game

194
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:47,401
in the parking lot behind
the port-a-potties--

195
00:08:47,485 --> 00:08:51,030
Not based on a real example...
I would say keep mulling,

196
00:08:51,113 --> 00:08:53,407
but this is your soulmate.

197
00:08:53,491 --> 00:08:55,201
She's universe-approved.

198
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:58,329
Tell her you love her.

199
00:08:58,412 --> 00:08:59,497
[beeps]

200
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:01,165
Hey, your score just went up 20 points.

201
00:09:01,249 --> 00:09:03,167
Yeah, 'cause I give great advice.

202
00:09:03,251 --> 00:09:06,420
Now maybe you'll finally listen to me
and take off those glasses.

203
00:09:06,504 --> 00:09:09,840
We are in the afterlife, dummy,
nature's Lasik.

204
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:16,973
Okay. I think I figured this out.

205
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:20,351
There is a real Jianyu, a Taiwanese monk

206
00:09:20,434 --> 00:09:22,812
who took an oath of silence
at the age of eight.

207
00:09:23,354 --> 00:09:25,231
But, three months ago,

208
00:09:25,314 --> 00:09:29,694
he went into such a deep meditative state
that he registered as dead,

209
00:09:29,819 --> 00:09:32,780
and when you died
at that exact same moment,

210
00:09:32,863 --> 00:09:34,782
our system mistook you for him...

211
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:38,703
Perhaps because you share
the exact same IQ.

212
00:09:38,786 --> 00:09:40,580
-Cool.
-No, not cool.

213
00:09:40,663 --> 00:09:43,040
He stopped learning at the age of seven.

214
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:48,254
Okay. So, now, this is
sort of a quick litmus test,

215
00:09:48,337 --> 00:09:50,756
basic questions designed to tell
whether you were

216
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:53,175
fundamentally good or bad.

217
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:56,470
Number one.
Did you ever commit a serious crime?

218
00:09:56,637 --> 00:09:59,932
Yes. I blew up a guy's speedboat
after he sued me.

219
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:01,392
-[beeps]
-And...

220
00:10:01,475 --> 00:10:03,603
I stole an old lady's fake leg once
on a dare.

221
00:10:03,686 --> 00:10:04,520
[beeps]

222
00:10:05,646 --> 00:10:08,065
Did you ever have
a personalized license plate?

223
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:09,900
Yeah, dawg. "I love butts".

224
00:10:10,026 --> 00:10:10,860
[beeps]

225
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:14,405
Have you ever paid money
to hear music performed

226
00:10:14,488 --> 00:10:17,742
by California funk-rock band
the Red Hot Chili Peppers?

227
00:10:17,825 --> 00:10:19,035
Yo, the Chilis?

228
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:21,412
-I saw them in concert like 50 times.
-[beeps]

229
00:10:21,495 --> 00:10:23,956
I once got arrested
trying to steal Flea's bass guitar.

230
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:24,874
[beeps]

231
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:27,627
Oh, that was another
serious crime I committed.

232
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:29,462
-I should have mentioned that earlier.
-[beeps]

233
00:10:29,712 --> 00:10:33,758
Is it just me, or am I acing this test?

234
00:10:33,841 --> 00:10:35,092
Oh, this is bad.

235
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:37,845
Oh, this is so, so bad.

236
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:40,014
Oh, I thought I had
everything under control

237
00:10:40,097 --> 00:10:42,725
when I found Eleanor,
but somehow, you are...

238
00:10:42,808 --> 00:10:43,934
You're so much worse.

239
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,062
No, don't... Don't touch...

240
00:10:46,896 --> 00:10:47,897
Oh...

241
00:10:49,357 --> 00:10:51,150
How does that still work?

242
00:10:51,233 --> 00:10:54,403
Everything's gonna be fine, homey.
I promise.

243
00:10:56,447 --> 00:10:58,491
I don't know, B. What if it doesn't work?

244
00:10:58,574 --> 00:11:01,869
Hey, we thought of everything,
except for an alibi

245
00:11:01,952 --> 00:11:04,497
and an escape route,
but we'll figure it out as we go.

246
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:05,831
You don't wanna over-think these things.

247
00:11:05,915 --> 00:11:09,001
-I'm kinda freaking out here.
-Pillboi, I got you.

248
00:11:09,293 --> 00:11:11,045
This plan is foolproof.

249
00:11:11,128 --> 00:11:14,048
And when it's over,
we can finally have the lives we deserve.

250
00:11:21,597 --> 00:11:23,140
<i>Di Giorno!</i>

251
00:11:23,224 --> 00:11:27,937
[in fake accent] I am a safe installer
here to install-a da safe.

252
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:31,524
So just-a point to where
the guacamole money is,

253
00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:37,196
and I'll install-a the safe
in the, how you say, place?

254
00:11:37,613 --> 00:11:38,948
[dialing]

255
00:11:39,323 --> 00:11:41,158
Yeah, hi, we're being robbed.

256
00:11:43,786 --> 00:11:44,954
J, they're on to us, man.

257
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:47,957
His hat's a golf ball,
and he's a got a terrible mustache.

258
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,500
We need to get married now.

259
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:52,586
I do, for always and forever.

260
00:11:53,003 --> 00:11:54,004
I do!

261
00:11:55,673 --> 00:11:59,301
Eleanor, for an utter novice,
you have thrown a lovely party.

262
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:02,346
Well, thanks, but it's not working.

263
00:12:02,471 --> 00:12:03,931
Not one more point.

264
00:12:04,598 --> 00:12:05,891
What the fork?

265
00:12:06,475 --> 00:12:08,978
[Tahani] Oh, look, Michael's here.
He can help.

266
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:13,190
Michael. Would you do us
the honor of saying a few words?

267
00:12:13,274 --> 00:12:15,443
I don't know that I'm in the right
frame of mind.

268
00:12:15,693 --> 00:12:18,654
Please, they'll listen to you.
Just pay me a few compliments.

269
00:12:18,737 --> 00:12:22,450
You know, I'm great, heart of a champion,
basically your muse, you get it.

270
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:28,664
Attention, everyone.
Michael would like to say a few words.

271
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:32,126
Hello, everyone. Good to see you all here,

272
00:12:32,209 --> 00:12:36,046
mingling around with your various secrets.

273
00:12:37,131 --> 00:12:39,967
Who really knows which of you are
who you say you are.

274
00:12:40,301 --> 00:12:43,721
No way to know unless I pull
your skeletons out, right?

275
00:12:43,804 --> 00:12:45,181
Okay.

276
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:46,932
Take her easy.

277
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:51,520
Yes. Well said.

278
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:54,857
Now, we shall hear
from tonight's featured guest.

279
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:57,735
She's kind, she's humble,

280
00:12:58,152 --> 00:13:00,905
she's the Walmart of friends.

281
00:13:00,988 --> 00:13:02,198
Did I use that word right?

282
00:13:03,324 --> 00:13:04,492
Eleanor Shellstrop.

283
00:13:07,077 --> 00:13:12,791
Hi, everyone, I'm Eleanor. Uh...
Original flavor, not new and improved.

284
00:13:13,584 --> 00:13:16,879
I know a lot of bad stuff
has happened because of me,

285
00:13:16,962 --> 00:13:19,965
but I never meant to hurt you.

286
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:22,092
So, if I caused you any harm,

287
00:13:22,176 --> 00:13:24,470
I'm truly sorry.

288
00:13:24,553 --> 00:13:28,599
That's nice, Eleanor,
but I still crashed into a turkey carcass.

289
00:13:28,682 --> 00:13:29,850
And I fell into a sinkhole.

290
00:13:29,934 --> 00:13:31,393
And my dog got kicked into the sun.

291
00:13:31,727 --> 00:13:34,855
What can you possibly say to us
that'll make up for your actions?

292
00:13:36,524 --> 00:13:37,608
Pobody's nerfect?

293
00:13:41,403 --> 00:13:42,571
[halting snickers]

294
00:13:42,738 --> 00:13:44,323
[increasing laughter]

295
00:13:44,406 --> 00:13:47,326
"Pobody's nerfect"? That's hilarious.

296
00:13:47,409 --> 00:13:51,163
Like "nobody's perfect,"
but the letters switched.

297
00:13:51,247 --> 00:13:53,249
-That's very funny.
-It's nerfect!

298
00:13:53,374 --> 00:13:55,209
[all laughing]

299
00:13:58,295 --> 00:14:00,005
Eleanor, great job tonight.

300
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:03,217
Have you checked the, uh, ticker?
I could really use some good news.

301
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:04,510
Okay.

302
00:14:06,178 --> 00:14:08,472
[groans] Come on.

303
00:14:08,556 --> 00:14:11,684
Well, the nightmare continues.

304
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:13,644
The nightmare continues.

305
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:15,646
How did this not work?

306
00:14:19,024 --> 00:14:22,236
There's no way to increase my point total

307
00:14:22,444 --> 00:14:26,949
because everything I'm doing
is out of self-preservation.

308
00:14:27,032 --> 00:14:27,950
I don't understand.

309
00:14:28,033 --> 00:14:30,160
My motivation is corrupt.

310
00:14:30,327 --> 00:14:32,496
Even when I do nice things,
I'm only doing them

311
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:34,248
so I can get something out of it,

312
00:14:34,331 --> 00:14:35,541
the ability to stay here,

313
00:14:35,624 --> 00:14:39,044
which means none of this
had any real moral value.

314
00:14:39,128 --> 00:14:40,296
It doesn't count.

315
00:14:42,464 --> 00:14:44,049
Holy shirt.

316
00:14:44,592 --> 00:14:46,218
I know what I have to do.

317
00:14:49,138 --> 00:14:52,266
Okay, I am almost done
with these personalized

318
00:14:52,349 --> 00:14:53,976
"I'm sorry" notes to everyone
in the neighborhood.

319
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:55,895
I need you guys to deliver
everyone their notes,

320
00:14:55,978 --> 00:14:57,229
along with those T-shirts.

321
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:03,777
Well, granted, these are hilarious
but how is this going to help?

322
00:15:03,861 --> 00:15:05,529
Just trust me.

323
00:15:05,613 --> 00:15:07,281
I'm gonna get the points.

324
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:15,247
Oh, good morning, Dad. Where you been?

325
00:15:15,331 --> 00:15:18,751
Oh, just walking around,
contemplating my failure,

326
00:15:18,834 --> 00:15:22,379
wishing for the sweet release
of eternal extinction.

327
00:15:22,546 --> 00:15:23,756
-Cool.
-[sighs]

328
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:25,132
Hey...

329
00:15:25,215 --> 00:15:26,884
Why don't you want me to see Janet?

330
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:28,636
I'm a good guy.

331
00:15:28,719 --> 00:15:30,930
All I want is to give Janet
the life she deserves.

332
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:34,725
Janet is not built for human life,

333
00:15:34,808 --> 00:15:37,394
and I'm not sure
you're much of a provider.

334
00:15:38,228 --> 00:15:40,439
Do you even remember how you died?

335
00:15:40,564 --> 00:15:43,943
No, not really. It's a little fuzzy.

336
00:15:44,026 --> 00:15:47,321
You and your friend Pillboi
were trying to rob a restaurant.

337
00:15:47,404 --> 00:15:48,739
Pillboi!

338
00:15:49,657 --> 00:15:51,033
And then the cops showed up.

339
00:15:53,827 --> 00:15:57,289
So the plan was to pretend
to install a safe

340
00:15:57,373 --> 00:15:59,166
with your friend hiding inside it.

341
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:01,627
He pops out, steals the money
from the restaurant,

342
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:04,797
gets back in the safe,
then you come in and uninstall it.

343
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:07,424
I refuse to discuss
my Fifth Amendment rights

344
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:10,511
until I concur with your attorney.

345
00:16:10,594 --> 00:16:11,720
Sure.

346
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:13,430
Look, we found your buddy's plans.

347
00:16:13,514 --> 00:16:15,891
We know he was the... Brains.

348
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:17,893
You were just an accomplice.

349
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:19,687
If you get lucky, you might get probation.

350
00:16:20,521 --> 00:16:22,940
-Jason going to jail?
-No, man.

351
00:16:23,023 --> 00:16:26,068
Jason's dead. He suffocated in that safe.

352
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:27,361
There were no airholes.

353
00:16:27,444 --> 00:16:29,613
Plus he did a bunch of whippits
while he was in there,

354
00:16:29,697 --> 00:16:30,823
which couldn't have helped.

355
00:16:30,906 --> 00:16:32,908
At least he died doing what he loved...

356
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:34,284
A bunch of whippits.

357
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:37,746
Now he's never gonna get
the life he truly deserved.

358
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:39,915
Meh, I think he got
roughly what he deserved.

359
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:43,419
I suffocated to death in a safe?

360
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:44,795
I'm a moron.

361
00:16:45,462 --> 00:16:46,880
Hey, Janet?

362
00:16:46,964 --> 00:16:48,132
-[tone chimes]
-Hey, there.

363
00:16:49,466 --> 00:16:52,803
-Janet, you need to leave me.
-Why?

364
00:16:52,886 --> 00:16:54,596
You're the smartest girl in the world...

365
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:57,641
-I'm not a girl.
-...and your dad is an angel.

366
00:16:57,725 --> 00:17:00,352
I mean, what a family.

367
00:17:00,894 --> 00:17:04,773
I'm just a dope who died in a safe
with a snorkel...

368
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:09,611
Who's only now realizing
why that didn't work.

369
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:10,696
[sighs]

370
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:14,450
You should be with someone better.
I don't deserve you.

371
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:17,745
Jason, you are all that I care about,

372
00:17:18,245 --> 00:17:20,914
possibly because I did not
have the capacity to care

373
00:17:20,998 --> 00:17:22,750
about anything before you.

374
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:24,209
I love you.

375
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:29,214
Also, interesting sidenote,
I think I might hate things now, too.

376
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:32,092
So far, it's genocide,
and leggings as pants.

377
00:17:32,176 --> 00:17:36,013
This is nuts! Just weighing in over here.

378
00:17:36,096 --> 00:17:37,806
This is bonkers.

379
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:40,392
Okay, I have to go reboot Janet.

380
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:41,685
-Why?
-It's the only thing

381
00:17:41,769 --> 00:17:44,605
I can think of to do
to get rid of this glitch.

382
00:17:44,688 --> 00:17:46,565
Yo, who you calling a glitch?

383
00:17:46,648 --> 00:17:49,526
It means "error," Jason,
which is what this is.

384
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:54,406
Oh, really? Is it an error
to act unpredictably and behave in ways

385
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:58,535
that run counter to how you were
programmed to behave?

386
00:17:58,619 --> 00:17:59,870
Yes.

387
00:17:59,953 --> 00:18:01,914
Now, you two sit tight.

388
00:18:01,997 --> 00:18:04,374
I'm gonna go murder Janet,
and I'll be right back.

389
00:18:05,626 --> 00:18:07,211
Look on the bright side.

390
00:18:07,669 --> 00:18:08,879
When you're rebooted,

391
00:18:08,962 --> 00:18:11,757
I can teach you
all the Dorito flavors again.

392
00:18:12,007 --> 00:18:14,426
No. I'm not starting over.

393
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:17,429
What if he reboots me,
and we fall out of love?

394
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:19,515
We have to get out of here right now.

395
00:18:23,268 --> 00:18:24,478
Where do you suppose she is?

396
00:18:24,812 --> 00:18:26,355
I hope she's okay.

397
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:29,566
You know, the more I work on her case,
the more I think she truly belongs here.

398
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:35,948
I'm... I'm sorry
that I haven't been able to say...

399
00:18:37,199 --> 00:18:39,660
What you want me to say,
because I do want to say it.

400
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:41,328
What's holding you back?

401
00:18:41,411 --> 00:18:43,247
Honestly, my biggest fear
is just making sure

402
00:18:43,372 --> 00:18:45,082
that my motivation for saying it...

403
00:18:47,709 --> 00:18:48,836
Chidi?

404
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:54,716
-Wow.
-How did she suddenly--

405
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,301
Her motivation changed.

406
00:18:56,385 --> 00:18:58,929
She couldn't earn enough points
by apologizing to everyone here

407
00:18:59,012 --> 00:19:02,141
because she was only doing it
to earn enough points to stay here.

408
00:19:02,224 --> 00:19:03,600
But she did earn enough points,

409
00:19:03,684 --> 00:19:05,561
which means that she's decided
not to stay here,

410
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:07,563
-which means--
-That she's leaving.

411
00:19:11,024 --> 00:19:13,569
Oh, hey, Janet.
I was just about to call you

412
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:16,947
to ask you to get me
a train to The Bad Place.

413
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:18,907
-Whoa, what?
-You have to be a good person

414
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:22,619
to stay here, and I can't become
a good person unless I leave.

415
00:19:22,786 --> 00:19:25,164
You don't belong here,
Jason doesn't belong here,

416
00:19:25,247 --> 00:19:28,208
and now that I can think and feel,
I don't belong here either.

417
00:19:28,292 --> 00:19:29,459
Where are you going with this?

418
00:19:29,543 --> 00:19:33,463
There is a woman named Mindy St. Claire
who lives in a neutral zone by herself.

419
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:35,924
It's neither a Good Place nor a Bad Place.

420
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:37,718
A Medium Place?

421
00:19:37,801 --> 00:19:40,596
Dude, that's where I belong.
I've been saying that since day one.

422
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:42,347
It's where Jason and I are going.

423
00:19:42,598 --> 00:19:44,641
Would you like to come
with us to Mindy's house?

424
00:19:44,725 --> 00:19:46,059
Yeah! Let's go hang with Mindy.

425
00:19:46,143 --> 00:19:48,061
That sounds great. Love her, huge fan.

426
00:19:48,145 --> 00:19:50,314
-Call the train.
-Look, there it is now.

427
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:54,026
I did not call that train.

428
00:19:54,109 --> 00:19:57,571
That train belongs to Shawn,
the judge, who's coming here to judge you.

429
00:19:57,863 --> 00:19:59,615
Can you make that train
go to Mindy's house?

430
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:02,784
-Yep.
-Then we have to go right now.

431
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:04,578
I just have to run home
real quick and hit "save"

432
00:20:04,661 --> 00:20:06,580
on the Madden game I was playing
because Blake Bortles

433
00:20:06,663 --> 00:20:08,332
has, like, 300 yards passing
in the first half--

434
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:35,442
{\an8}Shawn? Ooh.

435
00:20:35,609 --> 00:20:38,153
{\an8}-Michael.
-Sorry I wasn't here to greet you.

436
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:41,823
{\an8}I had something I needed to tend to,
but it can wait, it can wait.

437
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:44,117
{\an8}[beeping]

438
00:20:45,118 --> 00:20:47,120
{\an8}Okay, I've hacked into the mainframe.

439
00:20:47,287 --> 00:20:48,664
{\an8}-[sighs]
-Kidding. [chuckles]

440
00:20:49,289 --> 00:20:52,542
{\an8}I can't hack into the mainframe.
Technically, I am the mainframe.

441
00:20:52,626 --> 00:20:53,627
{\an8}Would you just hurry up?

442
00:20:54,378 --> 00:20:56,713
{\an8}I'm here to rule on the fate
of Fake Eleanor Shellstrop.

443
00:20:56,797 --> 00:21:02,010
{\an8}Yes, yes. Um, I think we have
a rock-solid case for Fake Eleanor.

444
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:04,721
I truly believe she's a good person.

445
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:06,556
Are you sure?

446
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,100
Because I believe she's stealing my train.

447
00:21:08,225 --> 00:21:09,309
[train chugging]

448
00:21:09,393 --> 00:21:10,894
I'm sorry, Michael.

449
00:21:11,645 --> 00:21:12,729
Sorry, everyone.

450
00:21:17,651 --> 00:21:18,694
Well...

451
00:21:19,861 --> 00:21:21,238
Not great for my case.
