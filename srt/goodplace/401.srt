1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:03,545
{\an8}[Judge] Michael designs
the new neighborhood.

2
00:00:03,628 --> 00:00:04,796
{\an8}Bad Place gets to choose
the four new humans.

3
00:00:04,879 --> 00:00:07,132
{\an8}The other residents will be Janet babies.

4
00:00:07,215 --> 00:00:08,758
[Derek] You know,
if we pooled our resources,

5
00:00:08,842 --> 00:00:11,177
we could be done
in two shakes of a lamb's Derek.

6
00:00:11,261 --> 00:00:12,303
[Janet] Thanks, Derek.

7
00:00:12,387 --> 00:00:14,931
<i>When you fail, the four humans</i>
<i>will be tortured for all eternity.</i>

8
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:17,142
<i>But guess who's going to be</i>
<i>doing the torturing?</i>

9
00:00:17,225 --> 00:00:18,518
<i>We built a Michael suit.</i>

10
00:00:18,601 --> 00:00:20,812
I can't do it. It's too scary.

11
00:00:21,396 --> 00:00:22,856
Hi, John. I'm the architect.

12
00:00:22,939 --> 00:00:24,023
Come on in.

13
00:00:24,107 --> 00:00:26,359
[Tahani] <i>The Bad Place </i>
<i>didn't pick the worst people.</i>

14
00:00:26,443 --> 00:00:30,238
They picked the people
who would be the worst for us.

15
00:00:30,321 --> 00:00:32,615
You need to erase my memory and reboot me.

16
00:00:32,699 --> 00:00:34,159
[Eleanor] Hi, Chidi. I'm Eleanor.

17
00:00:34,743 --> 00:00:35,660
Come on in.

18
00:00:38,121 --> 00:00:42,083
[Chidi] Wow. Just "wow." It's perfect.

19
00:00:42,751 --> 00:00:46,588
Everything is just perfect.
I am so, so happy!

20
00:00:46,671 --> 00:00:48,131
I'm glad you like it.

21
00:00:48,214 --> 00:00:49,507
It's so quaint.

22
00:00:49,591 --> 00:00:53,470
It feels cozy
but also vibrant and limitless.

23
00:00:53,553 --> 00:00:57,557
I can't believe how utterly,
completely, 100% perfect

24
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:59,184
-everything is.
-You know, let's keep this moving.

25
00:00:59,267 --> 00:01:00,435
Oh, yeah, sure.

26
00:01:00,518 --> 00:01:02,020
Here is your new home,

27
00:01:02,812 --> 00:01:05,815
complete with two of your favorite things,
floor-to-ceiling bookshelves and...

28
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:08,151
Reading lights! I love reading lights.

29
00:01:08,234 --> 00:01:09,319
They're great for reading.

30
00:01:09,402 --> 00:01:10,695
And, oh, check this out.

31
00:01:10,779 --> 00:01:14,532
Um, hold out your hand...
and think about a book.

32
00:01:16,117 --> 00:01:17,452
[whooshing]

33
00:01:18,036 --> 00:01:19,704
[chortling]

34
00:01:19,788 --> 00:01:22,957
I can summon philosophy books
like Thor's hammer.

35
00:01:23,041 --> 00:01:24,918
This is literally my number one dream.

36
00:01:25,001 --> 00:01:25,960
Also...

37
00:01:26,044 --> 00:01:26,920
Ow! [chuckling]

38
00:01:27,003 --> 00:01:27,837
That hurt.

39
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:29,631
[Eleanor] Well, I have a lot
to attend to, um...

40
00:01:30,381 --> 00:01:31,591
Welcome to the Good Place, Chidi.

41
00:01:31,674 --> 00:01:32,926
Thank you so much.

42
00:01:33,009 --> 00:01:37,972
Uh, and I'm sorry, this has been
so overwhelming, I forgot your name.

43
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:41,726
-Eleanor.
-Eleanor. Right.

44
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:44,187
Sorry. Eleanor. Eleanor. Eleanor.
Now I'll never forget.

45
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:46,272
Well, ya might! [chuckles]

46
00:01:50,735 --> 00:01:52,987
-Okay, can we not--
-[Tahani] Oh, Eleanor.

47
00:01:53,071 --> 00:01:55,406
You did a brave thing
and I am embracing you.

48
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:57,325
And I shall not let you go.

49
00:01:57,408 --> 00:01:59,160
And I am also embracing you

50
00:01:59,244 --> 00:02:01,788
because this feels warm
and my hands are cold.

51
00:02:01,871 --> 00:02:03,039
Guys, I'm good!

52
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:05,708
Honestly, it wasn't
even as bad as I thought.

53
00:02:06,334 --> 00:02:08,002
I mean, who cares
if he doesn't remember my name?

54
00:02:08,086 --> 00:02:09,212
Oof.

55
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:11,047
I mean, "cool-f."

56
00:02:11,673 --> 00:02:12,924
Good save, bud.

57
00:02:13,007 --> 00:02:15,385
Let's just concentrate
on the next resident,

58
00:02:15,468 --> 00:02:17,637
who gets here in six minutes.

59
00:02:18,596 --> 00:02:20,515
Wait. I need to say something.

60
00:02:20,598 --> 00:02:22,225
I know this seems bleak,

61
00:02:22,308 --> 00:02:26,563
and it feels like we're all doomed,
and therefore humanity is doomed.

62
00:02:26,646 --> 00:02:28,148
You needed to say that?

63
00:02:28,231 --> 00:02:31,568
The point is, I believe
that we're destined to succeed.

64
00:02:31,651 --> 00:02:34,988
There is nothing that the Bad Place
can throw at us that we can't handle.

65
00:02:35,071 --> 00:02:39,200
Because we are an incredible,
inspiring, brilliant group of--

66
00:02:39,284 --> 00:02:42,245
Supercharged D-bag ass-wiping maniacs.

67
00:02:42,328 --> 00:02:43,454
I mean, look at you!

68
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:49,168
I am so proud of how disgusting
and cruel you all are.

69
00:02:49,252 --> 00:02:50,587
You suck.

70
00:02:52,046 --> 00:02:54,883
You all suck donkey butts.

71
00:02:54,966 --> 00:02:58,928
Tahani, so... so smart and sophisticated.

72
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:01,806
She was the only one who was able
to talk me out of that goatee.

73
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:03,808
Well, I lost that battle
with Robert Downey Jr.,

74
00:03:03,892 --> 00:03:05,643
and I'll be damned if I lose it with you.

75
00:03:05,727 --> 00:03:08,021
-Bambadjan, such an unbelievable dingus.
-Thanks.

76
00:03:08,104 --> 00:03:11,232
And Val.
Who's a bigger skid mark than Val?

77
00:03:11,316 --> 00:03:12,483
Maybe your mom.

78
00:03:12,567 --> 00:03:14,360
[all laughing]

79
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,237
Classic.

80
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:20,325
We have Janet,
who can do literally anything.

81
00:03:20,408 --> 00:03:23,786
She made all the other people
in the neighborhood.

82
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:24,704
Not people.

83
00:03:24,787 --> 00:03:29,083
We have me, who had a momentary setback,
but I'm feeling great now,

84
00:03:29,167 --> 00:03:30,168
and that was a while ago.

85
00:03:30,251 --> 00:03:32,545
Most of you don't even remember it,
probably.

86
00:03:34,172 --> 00:03:36,674
We have Jason, who can...

87
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:43,765
And marching us into battle,
our fearless leader,

88
00:03:43,848 --> 00:03:48,311
the pride of Phoenix, Arizona,
Eleanor Shellstrop!

89
00:03:48,394 --> 00:03:49,270
[all cheering]

90
00:03:49,354 --> 00:03:53,399
Technically, the Pride of Phoenix
is a life-size statue of Alice Cooper

91
00:03:53,483 --> 00:03:55,026
made from cigarette butts.

92
00:03:55,109 --> 00:03:56,444
It's outside City Hall.

93
00:03:56,527 --> 00:03:58,655
But thank you for the kind words.

94
00:03:58,738 --> 00:04:02,450
With this team,
there's no problem we can't solve.

95
00:04:02,533 --> 00:04:04,619
There is no problem we can't create.

96
00:04:04,702 --> 00:04:08,373
And believe me,
we are gonna create some problems.

97
00:04:08,456 --> 00:04:11,793
So let's kick things off
with our official Bad Place song!

98
00:04:11,876 --> 00:04:14,963
<i>1 877 Kars for Kids</i>

99
00:04:15,046 --> 00:04:18,424
<i>K-A-R-S Kars for Kids</i>

100
00:04:18,508 --> 00:04:19,717
Ooh, are we singing?

101
00:04:19,801 --> 00:04:20,885
Shut up, Glenn.

102
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:22,971
[theme music playing]

103
00:04:27,725 --> 00:04:28,726
I think you look great.

104
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:31,896
Professional, serious,
a proper team leader.

105
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:35,358
{\an8}Does make me feel authoritative,
like that chick from <i>Law and Order.</i>

106
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:41,072
{\an8}"Well, boys, looks like
we've got ourselves an SVU."

107
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:43,408
I've never seen the show.

108
00:04:43,491 --> 00:04:45,743
-[whooshing]
-Okay. Who we got next?

109
00:04:48,621 --> 00:04:50,957
Linda? Come on in.

110
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:56,087
{\an8}So, you, Linda Johannsen,
are in the Good Place.

111
00:04:57,088 --> 00:04:58,089
{\an8}That's nice.

112
00:04:59,507 --> 00:05:02,885
{\an8}I know this can be a little overwhelming,
but you'll get used to it.

113
00:05:04,012 --> 00:05:05,179
{\an8}Do you have any questions?

114
00:05:06,097 --> 00:05:07,473
{\an8}Is there a fitness center?

115
00:05:07,557 --> 00:05:08,933
{\an8}There can be,

116
00:05:09,017 --> 00:05:13,688
{\an8}plus literally anything else
you could possibly wish for.

117
00:05:13,771 --> 00:05:17,900
{\an8}Just in case we weren't clear,
this is the Good Place.

118
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:19,736
{\an8}A state of eternal happiness.

119
00:05:20,903 --> 00:05:22,113
{\an8}Paradise.

120
00:05:22,905 --> 00:05:24,157
{\an8}That's nice.

121
00:05:25,241 --> 00:05:26,576
{\an8}I like that.

122
00:05:28,911 --> 00:05:31,456
{\an8}[Eleanor] So, the Bad Place sent Simone
to mess with Chidi,

123
00:05:31,539 --> 00:05:32,623
{\an8}John to mess with Tahani...

124
00:05:32,707 --> 00:05:34,917
{\an8}Do you think they sent Linda
to mess with Jason?

125
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:38,379
{\an8}She's from Norway.
Is Norway, like, the opposite of Florida?

126
00:05:38,463 --> 00:05:40,006
All I know is she's boring.

127
00:05:40,089 --> 00:05:43,301
She makes Neutral Janet
look like Disco Janet.

128
00:05:44,135 --> 00:05:46,596
Disco Janet was around
for a while years ago.

129
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:48,014
{\an8}She was great.

130
00:05:48,097 --> 00:05:50,600
{\an8}I mean, she was a lot, but she was fun.

131
00:05:50,683 --> 00:05:53,978
{\an8}Actually, that's a good idea.
Let's unload this dead weight.

132
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:55,438
{\an8}-Janet?
-Hi, there!

133
00:05:55,521 --> 00:05:57,065
{\an8}Linda, this is Janet.

134
00:05:57,148 --> 00:06:00,526
{\an8}If you want anything at all,
Janet can bring it to you. Watch.

135
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:04,989
{\an8}Janet, can I have a baby elephant
made of pure light

136
00:06:05,073 --> 00:06:07,700
{\an8}that tells you true secrets
about the universe?

137
00:06:08,367 --> 00:06:11,245
-Shirley Temple killed JFK.
-[Eleanor] See?

138
00:06:11,329 --> 00:06:12,580
Anything you want from Janet?

139
00:06:13,748 --> 00:06:16,793
Can I have... a peppermint?

140
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:18,044
Sure!

141
00:06:18,753 --> 00:06:19,587
[ding]

142
00:06:21,005 --> 00:06:22,590
I'm going to go over there now.

143
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,887
Stonehenge was a sex thing.

144
00:06:34,393 --> 00:06:36,312
Brent, come on in.

145
00:06:37,438 --> 00:06:41,150
So, you, Brent Norwalk, are dead.

146
00:06:42,151 --> 00:06:43,903
Really? Well, that blows.

147
00:06:43,986 --> 00:06:45,696
Uh, you know what?
Maybe it's a good thing, actually.

148
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:47,073
Some journalist was poking around,

149
00:06:47,156 --> 00:06:48,866
calling all these ladies
who used to work for me.

150
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:50,409
You can't even make a joke these days.

151
00:06:50,493 --> 00:06:51,536
Everything is so PC.

152
00:06:51,619 --> 00:06:54,080
And I was an equal opportunity
offender, okay?

153
00:06:54,163 --> 00:06:55,164
I made jokes about everybody.

154
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:57,917
And, by the way,
I'm the furthest thing from racist.

155
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,794
My dentist was a black woman.

156
00:07:00,294 --> 00:07:02,004
I just think people need to loosen up.

157
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:03,673
So, where am I exactly?

158
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:06,467
The Good Place.

159
00:07:07,218 --> 00:07:09,137
Cool. Good.

160
00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:14,100
[Eleanor] So, Brent, I see from your file
you were in the materials business.

161
00:07:14,183 --> 00:07:15,560
Oh, yeah. Big time.

162
00:07:15,643 --> 00:07:19,313
Strings, cords,
vinyl, synthetics, rubber...

163
00:07:19,397 --> 00:07:20,815
We do vulcanized now, so that's huge.

164
00:07:21,524 --> 00:07:24,235
Plus metals. Aluminum, brass, copper.
What else?

165
00:07:24,318 --> 00:07:26,529
-Steel?
-No, not steel.

166
00:07:26,612 --> 00:07:27,738
Steel's a sucker's game.

167
00:07:27,822 --> 00:07:29,449
Polymers, coatings, internals...

168
00:07:29,532 --> 00:07:32,952
You crack open an HVAC, that is all us.

169
00:07:33,035 --> 00:07:34,662
Is there golf here?
There freakin' better be.

170
00:07:34,745 --> 00:07:38,749
Okay, well, why don't you
explore around a bit while I go far away?

171
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:41,586
And if you need anything,
you can always ask Janet.

172
00:07:41,669 --> 00:07:43,463
-Janet?
-Hi, there! How can I help you?

173
00:07:43,546 --> 00:07:45,339
A secretary. Great.

174
00:07:45,423 --> 00:07:48,759
-Not a secretary.
-Fine. Executive assistant.

175
00:07:48,843 --> 00:07:51,137
Here we go with all the "terms"
we got to learn, right?

176
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:55,141
Vice President of Helping! Captain Marvel!
You know what I'm saying.

177
00:07:55,725 --> 00:07:56,809
I'm not part of this.

178
00:07:56,893 --> 00:07:57,894
Let me show you around.

179
00:07:59,896 --> 00:08:01,939
Well, Linda must be here for Jason,

180
00:08:02,023 --> 00:08:05,693
because Brent is definitely here
to annoy the fork out of me.

181
00:08:06,277 --> 00:08:08,779
Everyone, you may remember
Matt from Accounting.

182
00:08:08,863 --> 00:08:11,282
The Judge has assigned him to our project.

183
00:08:11,365 --> 00:08:13,242
So, I'll be monitoring
the four new humans.

184
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:16,746
A modified points system will be applied
to their actions for the next year,

185
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:18,456
and then we'll know
how much better or worse

186
00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:20,416
their behavior is
than when they were alive.

187
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:23,085
But no one will be able to see
what's happening in real time.

188
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:24,879
Good luck saving humanity
from eternal doom!

189
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:26,756
[boards clatter]

190
00:08:29,926 --> 00:08:31,010
[hums]

191
00:08:31,093 --> 00:08:32,637
[Eleanor] Okay, forget about
all that stuff.

192
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:35,181
For this first week, all we need to do

193
00:08:35,264 --> 00:08:37,975
is figure out what the fork is up
with these benches.

194
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:40,144
So, I made this.

195
00:08:40,728 --> 00:08:44,857
We start them out on this side,
because we're like, "What's your deal?"

196
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:47,693
And when we feel we have a handle
on who they are,

197
00:08:47,777 --> 00:08:50,363
what makes them tick,
we move them to this side...

198
00:08:51,239 --> 00:08:52,114
Party time!

199
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:54,909
We already know a lot about Simone, so...

200
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:56,869
Boom!

201
00:08:56,953 --> 00:08:58,829
See? One down, three to go.

202
00:08:58,913 --> 00:09:00,248
Let's go figure out the others.

203
00:09:00,331 --> 00:09:01,499
We can do this.

204
00:09:01,582 --> 00:09:04,335
On three. "Dead eyes, eat hearts,
can't lose!"

205
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:08,839
Sorry, old Bad Place rallying cry.

206
00:09:08,923 --> 00:09:11,342
[Derek groans] Aww!

207
00:09:11,425 --> 00:09:13,928
Janet, he's walking around again.

208
00:09:14,011 --> 00:09:14,929
Yeah, I see that.

209
00:09:15,012 --> 00:09:16,847
Derek, what are you doing here?

210
00:09:16,931 --> 00:09:18,391
You're supposed to stay at Mindy's.

211
00:09:18,474 --> 00:09:21,769
I can't help it.
I'm just such a proud daddy Derek.

212
00:09:21,852 --> 00:09:25,273
I mean, will you look at all these
beautiful babies that we made?

213
00:09:25,356 --> 00:09:28,693
She made them, dude.
You barely did anything.

214
00:09:28,776 --> 00:09:31,112
Probably just made all the butts.

215
00:09:31,195 --> 00:09:32,238
I did make all the butts.

216
00:09:32,321 --> 00:09:34,156
-I made that butt, I made that butt.
-[Janet] Mmm, right.

217
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,117
-[Derek] I made both those butts.
-[Janet laughs]

218
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,244
Derek, you have to stay at Mindy's house.

219
00:09:38,327 --> 00:09:39,954
What if one of our new humans sees you

220
00:09:40,037 --> 00:09:42,623
and starts asking questions
about the weirdo in the tux?

221
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:46,002
Say no more. But before I leave,
can I have a hug

222
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:48,879
in celebration of everything
that we created?

223
00:09:48,963 --> 00:09:50,756
-[Janet] Okay.
-[Derek] Aww!

224
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,967
That feels so...

225
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:55,177
Derek.

226
00:09:56,512 --> 00:09:59,849
<i>You are all, simply put, good people.</i>

227
00:09:59,932 --> 00:10:02,602
The point of the video
is to make them all confront

228
00:10:02,685 --> 00:10:04,770
what kind of people they were on Earth.

229
00:10:04,854 --> 00:10:10,109
Keep a close eye on our four subjects.
Try to gauge their reactions.

230
00:10:10,192 --> 00:10:13,571
The subtlest glances,
the tiniest flinches...

231
00:10:14,822 --> 00:10:16,699
What about shaking someone by the head?

232
00:10:16,782 --> 00:10:18,367
What does that mean?

233
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:19,660
[Michael] Oh, boy.

234
00:10:20,536 --> 00:10:23,998
Hey, Simone. Everything okay?

235
00:10:24,081 --> 00:10:25,666
Yeah. Well, no.

236
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:29,003
Well, actually, it doesn't matter.
None of this is real.

237
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:31,505
-Sorry?
-I'm a neuroscientist,

238
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:33,049
so I get what's going on here.

239
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:35,968
You know, clearly, I was in
some kind of horrible accident,

240
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:38,596
I'm on my deathbed, and this entire thing
is just a hallucination

241
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:41,223
constructed by my damaged brain
as it slowly shuts down.

242
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:42,224
It's not real.

243
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:46,437
So, I'm just gonna wander around
until I wake up or die.

244
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:48,689
See ya later, figments of my imagination.

245
00:10:48,773 --> 00:10:49,607
[indistinct chatter]

246
00:10:51,609 --> 00:10:56,030
She's just gonna go get some popcorn
from the... river.

247
00:10:56,614 --> 00:10:59,200
There's a popcorn river.
I'll show you guys later.

248
00:10:59,283 --> 00:11:01,869
Uh, she said keep going without her,
so let's roll it.

249
00:11:01,952 --> 00:11:03,746
Janet, make a popcorn river.

250
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:06,290
Everyone else,
meet at Mindy's in ten minutes.

251
00:11:06,874 --> 00:11:10,211
{\an8}Well... we're off to a fantastic start.

252
00:11:10,294 --> 00:11:13,089
I wish I could stay and help,
but this system is so complex

253
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:16,300
that if I lose concentration
for even one billionth of a second,

254
00:11:16,384 --> 00:11:19,053
the entire neighborhood could collapse
in on itself like a dying star.

255
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:22,681
Also, Brent wants a BLT.

256
00:11:22,765 --> 00:11:24,934
Simone's reaction is fairly common.

257
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:26,727
When I worked in the Bad Place,

258
00:11:26,811 --> 00:11:29,438
some people just wouldn't believe it
when they heard they were dead.

259
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:30,564
How did you convince them?

260
00:11:30,648 --> 00:11:34,068
They'd usually come around
by the third or fourth day of mouth fleas.

261
00:11:34,151 --> 00:11:36,070
Obviously, not an option here.

262
00:11:36,153 --> 00:11:38,155
But if Simone doesn't think this is real,

263
00:11:38,239 --> 00:11:40,282
she definitely won't become
a better person.

264
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:42,993
Who can convince her
that this actually is the afterlife?

265
00:11:43,077 --> 00:11:45,871
We need someone authoritative
and reassuring

266
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:48,582
like Nelson Mandela
or Sir Patrick Stewart,

267
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:51,419
or, really, any of my old
racquetball partners would do.

268
00:11:51,502 --> 00:11:52,711
Oh, I know who it should be.

269
00:11:52,795 --> 00:11:55,047
If you say Blake Bortles,
I'm gonna slap you a lot.

270
00:11:55,131 --> 00:11:57,425
Chidi. I believe everything
Chidi ever tells me

271
00:11:57,508 --> 00:11:59,260
because of his brain and how he looks like

272
00:11:59,343 --> 00:12:01,637
one of those owls
that graduated from college.

273
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,013
Of course!

274
00:12:03,097 --> 00:12:07,309
Time to activate our ethical sleeper agent
and introduce him to Simone.

275
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:08,519
Uh, I don't know.

276
00:12:08,602 --> 00:12:10,521
Simone isn't struggling
with a philosophy problem.

277
00:12:10,604 --> 00:12:13,649
She's just, you know, like... being silly.

278
00:12:13,732 --> 00:12:16,735
Let's just get her to the welcome party
and I'm sure she'll be fine.

279
00:12:16,819 --> 00:12:20,030
-[classical music playing]
-Eleanor, look what my brain did!

280
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:22,950
It's not real, and neither are you.

281
00:12:23,033 --> 00:12:26,287
<i>I'm in a coma and none of this is real</i>

282
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:29,665
Okay, I know this is bad
and we need a new approach,

283
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:32,668
but she is wearing
the hell out of those foam fingers.

284
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:37,089
<i>Root-a-toot-toot</i>

285
00:12:37,173 --> 00:12:39,800
Dude, Janet told you to stay at Mindy's.

286
00:12:39,884 --> 00:12:45,264
I know. I just came to mix myself
a Derek and then I'll be on my way.

287
00:12:46,056 --> 00:12:49,226
Before you leave, I wanna call a truce.

288
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:50,478
All right.

289
00:12:50,561 --> 00:12:53,898
I feel like you're trying
to get under my skin, but it's okay.

290
00:12:53,981 --> 00:12:56,233
I've decided to rise above it.

291
00:12:56,317 --> 00:12:58,152
Well spoken, Mr. Mendoza.

292
00:12:58,235 --> 00:13:00,696
Let me say in response...

293
00:13:01,363 --> 00:13:04,992
I will destroy you.

294
00:13:05,576 --> 00:13:11,665
Janet is and always will be
my mommy-girlfriend.

295
00:13:11,749 --> 00:13:15,127
You have crossed the Rubicon now, pal.

296
00:13:15,211 --> 00:13:16,670
[laughing]

297
00:13:17,046 --> 00:13:18,047
[glass breaking]

298
00:13:18,797 --> 00:13:20,216
[Derek chewing] Mmm...

299
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:22,092
[Eleanor] <i>Okay, status report.</i>

300
00:13:22,176 --> 00:13:23,802
What have we learned about Linda?

301
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:24,845
Little, I'm afraid.

302
00:13:24,929 --> 00:13:28,224
I tried talking to her, but it was
the dullest conversation I have ever had.

303
00:13:28,307 --> 00:13:31,727
And this is coming from someone who
once split a Xanax with Peter Sarsgaard.

304
00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:34,438
Frankly, I'm glad she's boring.
We have enough to worry about.

305
00:13:34,522 --> 00:13:37,441
-How is Brent doing?
-About the same, I'd say.

306
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:38,359
Princeton.

307
00:13:38,442 --> 00:13:40,945
Graduated in the top half
of the bottom half of my class.

308
00:13:41,028 --> 00:13:43,781
Rowing team, sailing team,
class president,

309
00:13:43,864 --> 00:13:44,949
I hung out with all those guys.

310
00:13:45,032 --> 00:13:48,077
Okay. And John,
our favorite gossip columnist?

311
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:51,539
Luckily, before I died, I pumped my face
with six vials of Juvederm.

312
00:13:51,622 --> 00:13:54,375
I'm hoping that my corpse
looks like a waxed tile floor.

313
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:57,086
My ex-boyf is gonna be supes jeal'.

314
00:13:57,169 --> 00:13:59,964
Okay, well, I'm gonna do a loop
trying to see who gets me.

315
00:14:00,047 --> 00:14:02,758
Our biggest liability right now is Simone.

316
00:14:02,841 --> 00:14:06,220
Let's try to keep the three of them
away from her.

317
00:14:07,596 --> 00:14:11,267
We can't wait any longer.
We have to introduce Simone to Chidi.

318
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:13,936
Why? I think she's doing great.

319
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:15,563
-[crashes]
-[crowd gasps]

320
00:14:15,646 --> 00:14:16,647
See?

321
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:18,607
She's getting all the cake-pushing
out of her system.

322
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:23,153
I know it's painful to think
of the two of them... connecting.

323
00:14:23,237 --> 00:14:26,115
But Chidi made an incredible sacrifice.

324
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:29,743
He had his memories erased
so he could help people.

325
00:14:29,827 --> 00:14:32,997
And if we don't let him help Simone,
it'll be all for nothing.

326
00:14:33,998 --> 00:14:35,165
Fine.

327
00:14:36,584 --> 00:14:39,628
Stupid ethical, reasonable argument.

328
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:42,047
Wish you were a cake. Push you over.

329
00:14:42,131 --> 00:14:45,509
-Are you still muttering?
-No, I stopped.

330
00:14:46,218 --> 00:14:48,929
Stupid, good-hearing, reformed demon.

331
00:14:49,638 --> 00:14:50,598
[Simone gasps]

332
00:14:50,681 --> 00:14:51,515
Whoa!

333
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:54,393
[both yelping]

334
00:14:54,476 --> 00:14:56,270
[Eleanor] Hey, there, Simone!

335
00:14:56,353 --> 00:14:58,564
-Shoving people in the pool, huh?
-Yeah.

336
00:14:58,647 --> 00:15:01,609
Just testing the laws of physics
here in my nonsense brain-jail.

337
00:15:01,692 --> 00:15:05,613
-Who's this?
-This is Chidi Anagonye.

338
00:15:05,696 --> 00:15:08,449
He was a professor
of ethics and moral philosophy,

339
00:15:08,532 --> 00:15:09,992
so I figured he might be able to help.

340
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:13,996
Chidi Anagonye. That sounds so familiar.
Where did you teach?

341
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:16,332
St. John's University in Sydney.

342
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:18,375
Of course. I used to teach there.

343
00:15:18,459 --> 00:15:20,336
I must have seen his name
on the faculty list

344
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:23,839
and now my dying brain
is just leaking out random information.

345
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:24,798
[exclaims]

346
00:15:24,882 --> 00:15:27,301
The human mind is truly incredible.

347
00:15:28,135 --> 00:15:30,888
<i>I want something else</i>

348
00:15:30,971 --> 00:15:33,098
<i>To get me through this</i>

349
00:15:33,182 --> 00:15:35,684
<i>Semi-charmed kind of life, baby, baby</i>

350
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:38,145
Sorry... uh, what's happening now?

351
00:15:38,228 --> 00:15:40,356
When I was a kid, my CD alarm clock broke

352
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:42,191
and it used to wake me up
to that song every day,

353
00:15:42,274 --> 00:15:44,944
so now I'm singing it
to try and wake myself up.

354
00:15:45,027 --> 00:15:46,820
Okay. Well, it was nice meeting you.

355
00:15:46,904 --> 00:15:51,033
Nice to meet you, too, cute guy generated
by my rapidly-decaying temporal lobe.

356
00:15:51,116 --> 00:15:53,077
[vocalizing]

357
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:55,120
[door opens]

358
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:57,414
-Hey--
-You know,

359
00:15:57,498 --> 00:16:00,584
it's bad enough that you guys
have taken over my house for a year

360
00:16:00,668 --> 00:16:02,503
and I've had to move into the attic,

361
00:16:02,586 --> 00:16:04,171
but now I have to walk in to find

362
00:16:04,254 --> 00:16:06,924
Darth Vader's turd
in the middle of my living room.

363
00:16:07,007 --> 00:16:08,258
I mean, what is this?

364
00:16:08,342 --> 00:16:09,760
No time to explain.

365
00:16:10,344 --> 00:16:11,679
Also, I kinda forgot.

366
00:16:11,762 --> 00:16:13,472
Where is Derek's plunger?
The one that kills him?

367
00:16:14,598 --> 00:16:17,309
[Mindy] Yeah, I used to do this
whenever I needed some alone time.

368
00:16:17,393 --> 00:16:21,021
Once, I rebooted him
just because he was breathing super loud.

369
00:16:21,105 --> 00:16:24,024
Then, when he woke up,
he was like, "I don't breathe."

370
00:16:24,108 --> 00:16:25,401
So I don't know what I heard.

371
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:27,987
Well, I'm doing this because
he's trying to steal my girlfriend.

372
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:30,072
Yeah. You don't need to justify it.

373
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:32,157
Again, I do it all the time.

374
00:16:33,033 --> 00:16:35,160
No! Mindy, please wait. Don't kill me.

375
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:36,078
Oh!

376
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:38,998
It's you? Okay.

377
00:16:39,081 --> 00:16:40,916
Well, you certainly
don't have the Dereks to--

378
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,251
[booming]

379
00:16:43,419 --> 00:16:44,420
[loud thud]

380
00:16:49,591 --> 00:16:50,592
[Mindy laughing]

381
00:16:51,802 --> 00:16:52,928
Yeah!

382
00:16:53,637 --> 00:16:54,471
Oh!

383
00:16:54,555 --> 00:16:55,681
It's always good.

384
00:16:55,764 --> 00:16:56,765
[vocalizing]

385
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:58,767
You know what, Simone?
Think of it this way.

386
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:02,688
If this is really all a hallucination,
doesn't it seem kinda basic?

387
00:17:02,771 --> 00:17:05,566
I mean, surely your brain
would imagine something weirder

388
00:17:05,649 --> 00:17:07,443
than just a nice cocktail party.

389
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:08,736
[Simone] You mean like that?

390
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:11,363
<i>Attention, I have been Derek'd.</i>

391
00:17:11,447 --> 00:17:14,575
That's probably my doctor.
[chuckles] This is all in my head.

392
00:17:14,658 --> 00:17:15,909
I'm gonna go eat a knife.

393
00:17:15,993 --> 00:17:18,579
<i>Attention. Murder has been me.</i>

394
00:17:18,662 --> 00:17:20,080
Let me get this straight.

395
00:17:20,164 --> 00:17:22,833
Derek "made mean eyes at you,"

396
00:17:22,916 --> 00:17:25,669
so you went to Mindy's house
and murdered him?

397
00:17:25,753 --> 00:17:27,963
Yeah, dawg, but his eyes were really mean.

398
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:29,798
You're probably thinking this...

399
00:17:31,592 --> 00:17:33,010
but they were more like this...

400
00:17:34,386 --> 00:17:36,180
Jason, why did you kill Derek?

401
00:17:36,263 --> 00:17:39,516
I had to get his giant head out of the sky
before any of the humans could see,

402
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,559
and it was not easy.

403
00:17:40,642 --> 00:17:43,145
I was scared Derek was trying
to slide into your DMs.

404
00:17:43,228 --> 00:17:44,855
-[Janet exclaims]
-I hate being scared. It's scary.

405
00:17:44,938 --> 00:17:45,898
I don't have time for this.

406
00:17:45,981 --> 00:17:47,858
I am running a neighborhood
and its residents,

407
00:17:47,941 --> 00:17:51,028
and Eleanor just casually orders me
to make popcorn rivers

408
00:17:51,111 --> 00:17:54,323
and Brent won't stop calling me for stuff.

409
00:17:54,406 --> 00:17:55,741
Ugh!

410
00:17:55,824 --> 00:17:57,534
Are we still boyfriend/not-a-girlfriend?

411
00:17:57,618 --> 00:17:58,994
We'll talk about it later.

412
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:01,622
Okay. Executive decision.
Forget about Simone.

413
00:18:01,705 --> 00:18:04,583
Janet, make sure she doesn't come
in contact with the other humans.

414
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:05,626
Let's focus on Linda.

415
00:18:05,709 --> 00:18:08,712
We ought to be able to figure her out.
We can just liven her up a bit.

416
00:18:08,796 --> 00:18:11,673
We'll just sprinkle some cocaine
on her peppermints or something.

417
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:13,967
Does anyone else find it suspicious

418
00:18:14,051 --> 00:18:17,012
that the Bad Place
sent someone so... dull?

419
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:18,722
No, it makes perfect sense to me.

420
00:18:18,806 --> 00:18:20,724
They are trying to drive us insane

421
00:18:20,808 --> 00:18:23,644
by giving us
a big, boring glob of plain yogurt.

422
00:18:23,727 --> 00:18:26,313
Tomorrow morning,
we start Operation Linda.

423
00:18:26,396 --> 00:18:28,107
Okay, you heard the lady.

424
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:30,275
We'll meet in the town square
bright and early.

425
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:31,527
Janet, set up for Flying Day.

426
00:18:32,152 --> 00:18:33,028
Cool.

427
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:35,197
I'm not busy or anything,
so that'll be easy.

428
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:37,199
Off you go!

429
00:18:37,741 --> 00:18:40,119
Whoo-hoo!

430
00:18:40,744 --> 00:18:43,956
Linda. How are you
enjoying the Good Place?

431
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:45,207
It's good.

432
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:48,127
Everyone's flying.

433
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:50,254
You don't want to go flying any higher?

434
00:18:50,337 --> 00:18:51,505
No, thanks.

435
00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:53,465
Well, okay.

436
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:55,592
It says in your file
that you liked knitting.

437
00:18:55,676 --> 00:18:57,719
Would you like to do
some knitting right now?

438
00:18:57,803 --> 00:18:58,846
No, thanks.

439
00:18:58,929 --> 00:19:01,473
Is there another activity
you'd like to do now?

440
00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:05,394
You also enjoyed... listening to birds?

441
00:19:06,019 --> 00:19:07,146
Man, Linda.

442
00:19:07,771 --> 00:19:09,148
You don't even look at them?

443
00:19:09,773 --> 00:19:12,359
Let's go hear some birds. What do you say?

444
00:19:12,442 --> 00:19:14,111
I'm gonna go get another peppermint.

445
00:19:14,194 --> 00:19:15,404
-No--
-Come on, Linds.

446
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:18,490
You can have literally anything
that you could poss--

447
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:20,325
What the--

448
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:21,660
[groaning]

449
00:19:25,956 --> 00:19:26,957
[citizens grunting]

450
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:28,750
[woman yelping]

451
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:29,877
[man groaning]

452
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:33,213
Okay. So... [sniffs]

453
00:19:33,297 --> 00:19:35,549
-Maybe she's less boring than I thought.
-[citizens screaming]

454
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,387
So, let me get this straight, Shawn.

455
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:44,224
You sent a demon in disguise
as one of the subjects?

456
00:19:44,308 --> 00:19:46,310
Yes, he did, Your Honor.

457
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:54,985
Luckily, none of the other test subjects
saw the mess he made.

458
00:19:55,068 --> 00:19:59,198
But he put the experiment at risk
and he attacked me and Eleanor.

459
00:19:59,281 --> 00:20:01,450
And, I'm sorry, where's your shirt?

460
00:20:02,075 --> 00:20:03,702
I think it got stuck in the skin suit.

461
00:20:03,785 --> 00:20:05,245
Well, keep it there.

462
00:20:05,329 --> 00:20:08,081
Damn it, Chris. You were supposed
to slowly undermine them

463
00:20:08,165 --> 00:20:10,334
and gradually sabotage the experiment,

464
00:20:10,417 --> 00:20:12,628
not just go ham on day two,
you fart plume.

465
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:14,588
I told you, I'm not an actor.

466
00:20:14,671 --> 00:20:16,632
And when you get back here,
you won't be anything.

467
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:19,718
Okay, fine, yes, busted. I'm a rascal.

468
00:20:19,801 --> 00:20:22,012
We'll come pick him up
and replace him with an actual human.

469
00:20:22,095 --> 00:20:25,182
You will do nothing of the sort, <i>mon ami.</i>

470
00:20:25,265 --> 00:20:27,559
This outrageous act must be punished.

471
00:20:28,143 --> 00:20:30,729
Chidi will be the fourth subject
in this experiment.

472
00:20:30,812 --> 00:20:32,272
[Shawn] No, no, no, no, no.

473
00:20:32,356 --> 00:20:34,524
He's perfect because he's already
had his memories erased.

474
00:20:34,608 --> 00:20:37,569
Although you can't erase that booty.
Know what I'm sayin', blondie?

475
00:20:37,653 --> 00:20:40,072
All due respect, Your Honor,
keep it in your robe.

476
00:20:40,155 --> 00:20:43,367
What she means is,
"Thank you, Your Honor, we accept."

477
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:44,952
Chidi's gonna be our fourth subject.

478
00:20:45,035 --> 00:20:46,787
Chidi can't be part of the experiment.

479
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:48,163
They already know that he can improve.

480
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:51,041
That's like studying for a test
then acing the test.

481
00:20:51,124 --> 00:20:53,210
-It's cheating.
-How is that cheating?

482
00:20:53,293 --> 00:20:56,296
You're just falsely accusing us
of what you actually did.

483
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:57,589
No, that's what you're doing.

484
00:20:57,673 --> 00:20:59,383
[Judge] Shawn, I don't have time for this.

485
00:20:59,466 --> 00:21:01,677
I just started <i>Deadwood,</i> finally,

486
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,930
and I need my daily dose
of Timothy Olyphant,

487
00:21:05,013 --> 00:21:06,598
so I'm gonna make this short.

488
00:21:06,682 --> 00:21:10,852
If you so much as breathe
on this experiment again,

489
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:14,398
I will restart the entire thing
from scratch,

490
00:21:14,481 --> 00:21:18,151
and then I will personally
rip off your eyelids

491
00:21:18,235 --> 00:21:23,031
and make you watch heartwarming videos
of soldiers coming home to their dogs.

492
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:24,283
[claps]

493
00:21:24,366 --> 00:21:25,993
[Michael] Whoa! Slow down.

494
00:21:27,744 --> 00:21:28,578
[clattering]

495
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:32,332
[Eleanor] Did you put those trash cans
there just so you could crash into them?

496
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:34,918
That wasn't my fault. I was texting.
[smacks lips]

497
00:21:35,002 --> 00:21:36,378
Okay, let him go, dung buckets.

498
00:21:36,461 --> 00:21:37,838
{\an8}Nice try.

499
00:21:37,921 --> 00:21:40,799
{\an8}We'll put him on the train
and handcuff him to a bench.

500
00:21:40,882 --> 00:21:41,967
{\an8}Come on.

501
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:45,053
{\an8}Yeah, forgive us if we don't trust you
not to cheat again.

502
00:21:45,846 --> 00:21:47,639
{\an8}Surprised you figured out
that Linda was a fake,

503
00:21:47,723 --> 00:21:50,642
{\an8}because we all thought
you were too stupid.

504
00:21:50,726 --> 00:21:53,478
{\an8}Well, it was actually Tahani
who got suspicious.

505
00:21:53,562 --> 00:21:55,188
{\an8}[chuckles] Oh!

506
00:21:55,272 --> 00:21:57,065
{\an8}That is so embarrassing for you.

507
00:21:57,149 --> 00:22:00,527
{\an8}Seems like you're royally forking this up
just like we knew you would.

508
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:02,112
{\an8}-[Eleanor sighs]
-Okay.

509
00:22:02,195 --> 00:22:03,196
{\an8}Take off.

510
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,823
{\an8}And give Shawn a message for me.

511
00:22:04,906 --> 00:22:07,200
{\an8}Tell him that we said, "Booyah!"

512
00:22:08,368 --> 00:22:10,912
Make sure you do the hand motion,
like, "Booyah!"

513
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:12,748
-Are you listening to me?
-Okay, Michael--

514
00:22:12,831 --> 00:22:14,207
-No, show me how you're gonna do it.
-That's fine.

515
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:16,752
No, it's important
that she does the hand thing

516
00:22:16,835 --> 00:22:18,712
because it really drives the point home.
