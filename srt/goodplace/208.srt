1
00:00:03,128 --> 00:00:06,715
Hello, Michael. Shut the door.
Have a seat.

2
00:00:08,341 --> 00:00:10,301
When you proposed
this new form of torture,

3
00:00:10,385 --> 00:00:12,387
we all laughed behind your back.

4
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:16,182
Some people called you names,
like the Thomas Edison of incompetence

5
00:00:16,266 --> 00:00:17,684
or "that dick."

6
00:00:17,767 --> 00:00:18,935
[chuckles]

7
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:21,938
But it seems you've pulled it off.

8
00:00:22,021 --> 00:00:24,607
-What you've done here is amazing.
-Really?

9
00:00:24,691 --> 00:00:26,693
Yes. These reports are remarkable.

10
00:00:26,776 --> 00:00:29,070
Your humans
are experiencing emotional torture

11
00:00:29,154 --> 00:00:30,530
at the same level of physical torture

12
00:00:30,613 --> 00:00:33,283
created by our squiggliest
eyeball corkscrews.

13
00:00:33,366 --> 00:00:35,493
I'm jubilant.

14
00:00:36,077 --> 00:00:39,372
As a result of our success,
I'm getting a seat on the High Council.

15
00:00:39,456 --> 00:00:44,127
We will expand our neighborhood idea
and you will oversee the project.

16
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:45,670
You are being promoted.

17
00:00:48,631 --> 00:00:50,091
Your senior staff pin.

18
00:00:50,175 --> 00:00:53,178
Congratulations.
This is everything you've ever wanted.

19
00:00:53,261 --> 00:00:55,805
This is everything I've ever wanted.

20
00:00:55,889 --> 00:00:57,432
Oh! [chuckles]

21
00:00:58,224 --> 00:01:00,351
This is everything I've ever wanted!

22
00:01:00,977 --> 00:01:02,020
Oh, wow!

23
00:01:02,103 --> 00:01:03,730
You're really happy?

24
00:01:03,813 --> 00:01:04,731
Can't you tell?

25
00:01:04,814 --> 00:01:07,442
I'm basically squealing
like a birthday girl.

26
00:01:07,525 --> 00:01:09,527
[theme music playing]

27
00:01:15,116 --> 00:01:18,578
{\an8}At some point,
we should discuss yesterday's events.

28
00:01:18,661 --> 00:01:20,705
{\an8}Do you mean us almost getting married

29
00:01:20,789 --> 00:01:23,166
{\an8}and then finding out
I was married to Janet?

30
00:01:23,249 --> 00:01:25,001
{\an8}Then Janet making a boyfriend to forget me

31
00:01:25,084 --> 00:01:26,920
{\an8}and then Janet
getting rid of that boyfriend?

32
00:01:28,171 --> 00:01:31,007
{\an8}Or do you mean
when we saw that cool cloud?

33
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:32,342
{\an8}The first bit.

34
00:01:32,425 --> 00:01:34,385
{\an8}Perhaps after Michael briefs us

35
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:35,845
{\an8}on how we're going to be
fake-tortured today,

36
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:37,472
{\an8}we can sit down and chat?

37
00:01:38,515 --> 00:01:40,683
{\an8}Yes. Good idea.

38
00:01:41,267 --> 00:01:42,602
{\an8}-Yo, Chidi?
-Yeah?

39
00:01:42,685 --> 00:01:44,771
{\an8}Wanna hear about a cool cloud I saw?

40
00:01:48,525 --> 00:01:50,110
{\an8}Come in.

41
00:01:51,903 --> 00:01:56,991
{\an8}I'd like to start by saying something
I wanted to say for a very long time.

42
00:01:57,075 --> 00:01:59,327
{\an8}Surprise, idiots!

43
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:01,287
{\an8}You're all in the Bad Place.

44
00:02:01,996 --> 00:02:03,665
{\an8}[Michael and Shawn laughing]

45
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:06,209
{\an8}That's right, nerds.

46
00:02:06,292 --> 00:02:11,422
{\an8}Everything around you, all you can see,
is an elaborate system of torture

47
00:02:11,506 --> 00:02:13,675
{\an8}designed just for you.

48
00:02:14,259 --> 00:02:17,262
Sorry, we're in the Bad Place?

49
00:02:17,345 --> 00:02:20,348
Why are you revealing this now?

50
00:02:20,431 --> 00:02:22,684
It was an experiment and it worked.

51
00:02:22,767 --> 00:02:24,144
So, my boss is promoting me.

52
00:02:24,227 --> 00:02:27,355
Sorry, I should've introduced you.
This is my boss, Shawn.

53
00:02:27,438 --> 00:02:28,898
Hello, imbeciles.

54
00:02:29,482 --> 00:02:31,234
We need to study
everything that happened here.

55
00:02:31,317 --> 00:02:34,612
There was a first version that collapsed,
but the second has been a huge success.

56
00:02:34,696 --> 00:02:35,864
We'll shut this place down.

57
00:02:35,947 --> 00:02:38,158
The four of you will be brought
to the real Bad Place,

58
00:02:38,241 --> 00:02:40,201
where your brains
will be removed, studied,

59
00:02:40,285 --> 00:02:42,162
then batted about a stadium
like beach balls.

60
00:02:42,245 --> 00:02:45,165
Your arms will be peeled like bananas.
That part's just for fun.

61
00:02:45,248 --> 00:02:46,082
[chuckles] Right.

62
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:50,169
And then you will be, you know,
tortured forever.

63
00:02:50,753 --> 00:02:52,589
Michael, is this all true?

64
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:54,591
Yes, Eleanor, it is.

65
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:58,970
You're such a rube,
thinking you could become a better person.

66
00:02:59,053 --> 00:03:02,473
You got Chidi
to teach you stupid philosophy?

67
00:03:03,182 --> 00:03:06,019
Like those old farts
were gonna provide guidance.

68
00:03:06,102 --> 00:03:10,940
"Oh, Kierkegaard is so great.
Have you read <i>Fear and Trembling?"</i>

69
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:14,235
Well, I don't know.
Have you read <i>Boring and Stupid? </i>

70
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:16,070
Because that's what you are.

71
00:03:16,154 --> 00:03:17,488
-Nice.
-Thank you.

72
00:03:17,572 --> 00:03:19,240
How long will it take you
to shut down the neighborhood?

73
00:03:19,324 --> 00:03:20,867
[Michael] Better part of a day.

74
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:23,494
In the meantime, why don't we have
a farewell party tonight?

75
00:03:23,578 --> 00:03:25,997
To thank the crew for all the hard work?

76
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,749
We could jam to some tunes.

77
00:03:27,832 --> 00:03:31,127
Destroy the place,
play beer pong with Jason's testicles.

78
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:32,086
What do you say, boss?

79
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:33,838
Sure. By the way,
I know what you're thinking.

80
00:03:33,922 --> 00:03:35,340
-"Maybe Janet can help."
-Ah.

81
00:03:35,423 --> 00:03:36,841
You're wrong. Janet?

82
00:03:37,383 --> 00:03:39,969
[gasps] Oh, hi, little cuties.

83
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:42,263
[chuckles] I love you guys so much.

84
00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:45,850
Except for you, Jason, because I hate you.
[chuckles] I hate you.

85
00:03:45,934 --> 00:03:47,477
Janet? What's wrong?

86
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,020
Oh, where's my phone?

87
00:03:49,103 --> 00:03:53,024
We put a Restraining Bracelet on her,
disrupting her powers.

88
00:03:53,107 --> 00:03:57,528
It's made of mag-a-nets.
Mag-nets. Mag-a-nittens...

89
00:03:57,612 --> 00:04:00,114
Magnets are supposed to
make me feel drunk.

90
00:04:00,198 --> 00:04:02,283
But guess what? I feel fine.

91
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:03,409
[chuckling]

92
00:04:04,452 --> 00:04:09,666
I can't believe Michael betrayed us again.
Why is it always the ones you most expect?

93
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:13,336
I should've seen this coming.
No one can truly turn over a new leaf.

94
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:16,881
Ben Affleck told me he'd matured
after he directed <i>Argo.</i>

95
00:04:16,965 --> 00:04:21,594
But then, right on schedule, it was,
"Guess what, Tahani? I'm gonna be Batman!"

96
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:24,055
There's only one option.
Shawn clearly doesn't know

97
00:04:24,138 --> 00:04:26,641
Michael has rebooted this neighborhood
800 times.

98
00:04:26,724 --> 00:04:29,686
I say we trade that information
for some kind of reduced sentence.

99
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:31,437
[Tahani] Chidi, they're monsters.

100
00:04:31,521 --> 00:04:34,148
Who's to say they won't agree to a deal

101
00:04:34,232 --> 00:04:37,360
and then turn around and install us
into their horrible human zoo?

102
00:04:37,443 --> 00:04:38,569
[Chidi] There's no other option.

103
00:04:38,653 --> 00:04:40,947
There's no way for a human
to get that bracelet off Janet.

104
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:44,492
If there were, we could get her to call us
a train to Mindy St. Claire's house.

105
00:04:44,575 --> 00:04:46,452
We know for a fact
the people from the Bad Place

106
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:48,621
can't follow us there and I vote for that.

107
00:04:48,705 --> 00:04:49,956
I vote we...

108
00:04:50,039 --> 00:04:54,377
No, sorry. And no offense, Jason,
but the stakes here are too high

109
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:58,589
to let someone with your limited
intellectual processing capacity weigh in.

110
00:04:58,673 --> 00:04:59,966
I was gonna agree with you.

111
00:05:00,049 --> 00:05:01,843
Oh, great. That's two votes for my plan.

112
00:05:01,926 --> 00:05:04,262
All right. Eleanor, what do you think?

113
00:05:04,345 --> 00:05:08,516
Trade information on Michael
or try to escape to the Medium Place?

114
00:05:08,599 --> 00:05:11,853
Neither. I vote we ignore
everything Michael just said

115
00:05:11,936 --> 00:05:13,980
and assume he's still on our side.

116
00:05:14,939 --> 00:05:16,357
Who's with me?

117
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:22,155
Sorry, but when all this started,
you said Michael wasn't trustworthy.

118
00:05:22,238 --> 00:05:23,531
Now you want us to trust him?

119
00:05:23,614 --> 00:05:27,910
Yes. For one very specific
and rock-solid reason.

120
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:29,662
What's-his-name.

121
00:05:30,246 --> 00:05:31,331
Who?

122
00:05:31,414 --> 00:05:33,541
The dude!
The super depressing religious guy,

123
00:05:33,624 --> 00:05:36,002
the real buzzkill
whose name I can never remember.

124
00:05:36,085 --> 00:05:39,964
Keeblers... Car. Kyra. Sedgwick?

125
00:05:40,048 --> 00:05:41,966
Oh, I love her. Dear friend of mine.

126
00:05:42,925 --> 00:05:44,385
Not important right now.

127
00:05:44,469 --> 00:05:45,344
Kierkegaard?

128
00:05:45,428 --> 00:05:47,096
Yes! Kierkegaard!

129
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:53,311
When Michael was mocking us,
whose name did he use? Kierkegaard.

130
00:05:53,394 --> 00:05:56,606
He was sending us a message.
To take a leap of faith.

131
00:05:56,689 --> 00:05:58,399
'Cause that was Kierkegaard's thing,
right?

132
00:05:58,483 --> 00:06:01,027
Yes, but it's probably
better translated as

133
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:02,111
"a leap into faith."

134
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:04,906
-It's so hard to be your friend.
-Yeah. Sorry.

135
00:06:04,989 --> 00:06:06,866
Michael wants us to trust him.

136
00:06:06,949 --> 00:06:08,868
I spoke to him the other night

137
00:06:08,951 --> 00:06:12,371
about the whole Derek incident.
Dude was shook.

138
00:06:12,455 --> 00:06:16,167
Talking about ethics
and all spiraling about human stuff.

139
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:18,169
I think he's on our side.

140
00:06:18,252 --> 00:06:21,506
Or he's a supernatural demon
designed to torture people,

141
00:06:21,589 --> 00:06:23,299
who got offered his dream job

142
00:06:23,382 --> 00:06:25,551
and has flipped on us
like a ten-stone griddle-chip.

143
00:06:26,677 --> 00:06:28,137
It's a large pancake.

144
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:30,807
[snapping fingers] Come on,
you can get these from context.

145
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:35,353
Maybe Michael jumped back
to the dark side, but I don't think so.

146
00:06:35,436 --> 00:06:36,979
I think he's gonna help us escape.

147
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:39,023
I know it sounds crazy.

148
00:06:39,107 --> 00:06:42,944
But if it weren't crazy,
they wouldn't call it "a leap of faith."

149
00:06:43,027 --> 00:06:47,990
They would call it "a sit of doubting."

150
00:06:49,575 --> 00:06:54,080
I never thought I'd be the one to say it,
but this is getting out of hand.

151
00:06:55,289 --> 00:06:59,710
-We gotta go to the cops.
-What cops? Where do you think we are?

152
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:03,047
Before tonight's party,

153
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:06,092
I'd love to talk more
about your strategy for torturing Tahani.

154
00:07:06,175 --> 00:07:08,719
I'm impressed you made her
fall in love with Jason.

155
00:07:08,803 --> 00:07:10,680
She must be miserable.

156
00:07:10,763 --> 00:07:14,434
Yeah. Humans make a lot of mistakes
when they're horny.

157
00:07:17,395 --> 00:07:20,106
Ah, boss, give me a second here.

158
00:07:22,066 --> 00:07:23,526
-What the here?
-Vicky...

159
00:07:23,609 --> 00:07:27,071
My hard work paid off for you
and you're taking the credit.

160
00:07:27,155 --> 00:07:29,907
Vicky, this can work out great
for both of us,

161
00:07:29,991 --> 00:07:31,367
if we play our cards right.

162
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:34,579
Shawn thinks that
this is attempt number two, right?

163
00:07:34,662 --> 00:07:37,081
If I tell him
you've been in charge of this version,

164
00:07:37,165 --> 00:07:40,877
he'll find out there have been
hundreds of failed versions.

165
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,463
Oh, right.

166
00:07:43,546 --> 00:07:45,590
And if that happens, we're all going down.

167
00:07:45,673 --> 00:07:47,091
-So, spread the word.
-[sighs]

168
00:07:47,175 --> 00:07:49,552
No one talks about the reboots.

169
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:52,430
Fine. You better make this right.

170
00:07:52,513 --> 00:07:55,183
Mama want promotion. Ya heard?

171
00:07:57,018 --> 00:07:58,853
[indistinct chatter]

172
00:07:58,936 --> 00:08:00,563
[inaudible]

173
00:08:02,857 --> 00:08:06,486
-Hello, you dummies!
-[all laughing]

174
00:08:07,069 --> 00:08:10,490
This neighborhood was a labor of hate
for many people here.

175
00:08:10,573 --> 00:08:13,284
So I thought that we should celebrate

176
00:08:13,367 --> 00:08:18,122
with an art form that we literally
invented here in the Bad Place.

177
00:08:18,206 --> 00:08:20,750
The comedy roast.

178
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:22,126
[all cheering]

179
00:08:23,419 --> 00:08:25,713
[Michael] I see Jason Mendoza's here.

180
00:08:25,796 --> 00:08:28,174
Jason might not be
the smartest guy in the world,

181
00:08:28,257 --> 00:08:31,219
but he is the dumbest guy in the world.

182
00:08:31,302 --> 00:08:32,470
[audience laughing]

183
00:08:32,553 --> 00:08:36,140
Oh, Jason, buddy.
All you had to do was to keep quiet.

184
00:08:36,224 --> 00:08:39,393
But you couldn't stop talking
about Kendall Jenner

185
00:08:39,477 --> 00:08:43,481
or that dumb quarterback.
What was his name? Derek Bortles?

186
00:08:43,564 --> 00:08:45,816
Always ranting about Derek Bortles.

187
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:47,527
Lucky for you, my friend,

188
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:51,030
Jaguars games are the only ones televised
in the Bad Place

189
00:08:51,113 --> 00:08:52,865
because they suck!

190
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:54,492
[laughing]

191
00:08:55,451 --> 00:08:59,455
No, they don't! All we need is a defense
and an offense and some rule changes.

192
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:00,665
Don't take it personally.

193
00:09:00,748 --> 00:09:03,584
He has to put on a show
for the other demons.

194
00:09:03,668 --> 00:09:08,923
Tahani Al-Jamil.
Elegance, grace, sophistication.

195
00:09:09,006 --> 00:09:10,883
But enough about your sister!

196
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:12,426
[audience laughing]

197
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:16,305
You know what the worst moment
of Tahani's life was?

198
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:18,975
When the last song played
at one of her parties

199
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:21,143
and she would run off and cry

200
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:23,437
because she still hadn't won
her parents' approval.

201
00:09:23,521 --> 00:09:24,438
[laughing]

202
00:09:24,522 --> 00:09:26,983
You know the other worst moment
of Tahani's life?

203
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:31,404
Every other moment
of her empty, pointless life!

204
00:09:31,487 --> 00:09:33,739
-[Michael exclaims]
-[audience laughing]

205
00:09:33,823 --> 00:09:38,578
I see Eleanor Shellstrop is here.
Eleanor and I have a lot in common.

206
00:09:38,661 --> 00:09:40,538
Here's how you tell us apart.

207
00:09:40,621 --> 00:09:42,748
One of us is a manipulative demon

208
00:09:42,832 --> 00:09:45,459
who's an expert
at making other people miserable,

209
00:09:45,543 --> 00:09:47,962
and then the other one is me!

210
00:09:48,045 --> 00:09:49,880
[laughing]

211
00:09:49,964 --> 00:09:54,343
You thought you deserved a Medium Place
like Mindy St. Claire?

212
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:57,597
Are you kidding me? You're bad, Eleanor.

213
00:09:58,389 --> 00:10:00,933
This is exactly the place you should be.

214
00:10:01,017 --> 00:10:03,561
Not super funny for a roast, there, bud.

215
00:10:03,644 --> 00:10:04,770
Oh, you want a joke?

216
00:10:04,854 --> 00:10:07,607
You love Chidi
and Chidi doesn't love you back.

217
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:09,650
-Boom!
-[audience laughing]

218
00:10:09,734 --> 00:10:14,030
Now that's funny
because it's very cruel and humiliating.

219
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:15,990
-You're one of my closest friends.
-Not now.

220
00:10:16,073 --> 00:10:17,283
[Michael] "Speaking of Chidi,"

221
00:10:17,366 --> 00:10:21,912
is something no one has ever said
because no one talks about Chidi,

222
00:10:21,996 --> 00:10:26,792
because no one likes Chidi,
because he's so annoying about ethics.

223
00:10:28,044 --> 00:10:30,087
Now, when you taught the trolley problem,

224
00:10:30,171 --> 00:10:35,426
did you secretly wish that it could be you
who wound up under the trolley?

225
00:10:35,509 --> 00:10:37,303
Because all your students did.

226
00:10:37,386 --> 00:10:39,013
-Whoo-hoo!
-[audience laughing]

227
00:10:39,096 --> 00:10:42,224
Whoa, Chidi, sorry, I got a joke
for you, bud. Uh, knock-knock.

228
00:10:42,808 --> 00:10:43,643
Who's there?

229
00:10:43,726 --> 00:10:46,354
You died alone because
you couldn't commit to anyone.

230
00:10:46,437 --> 00:10:47,605
[laughing]

231
00:10:47,688 --> 00:10:50,024
"You died alone because
you couldn't commit to anyone," who?

232
00:10:50,107 --> 00:10:52,360
-No.
-Jason Mendoza!

233
00:10:52,443 --> 00:10:53,527
[laughing]

234
00:10:53,611 --> 00:10:59,742
Okay, that's all my time.
Let's tear this mother to the ground!

235
00:10:59,825 --> 00:11:01,994
[all cheering]

236
00:11:06,832 --> 00:11:11,671
So, maybe I was wrong
and Michael isn't on our side.

237
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:16,342
What up, fart sticks?

238
00:11:16,425 --> 00:11:19,470
That was "She Hates Me" by Puddle of Mudd.

239
00:11:19,553 --> 00:11:23,391
Coming up next,
"Grandma Got Run Over By A Reindeer."

240
00:11:23,474 --> 00:11:25,851
-Idiots.
-[blows horn]

241
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:29,188
-We're going streaking! [screams]
-[cheering]

242
00:11:31,315 --> 00:11:34,860
Ugh. The one time I think
someone isn't lying to me,

243
00:11:34,944 --> 00:11:36,404
it bites me in the ash.

244
00:11:36,487 --> 00:11:40,157
I guess Michael really did flip back
to the bad side.

245
00:11:40,241 --> 00:11:41,534
Oh, does one think?

246
00:11:41,617 --> 00:11:43,786
That roast was the meanest thing
I've ever seen

247
00:11:43,869 --> 00:11:47,039
and I saw a waiter bring Russell Crowe
the wrong tea.

248
00:11:47,123 --> 00:11:48,791
Well, we have no choice. We go to Shawn

249
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:51,252
and we say we'll trade
secret information about the reboots

250
00:11:51,335 --> 00:11:52,586
if he'll go easy on us.

251
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:53,754
-[sighs]
-And if that doesn't work,

252
00:11:53,838 --> 00:11:56,549
we try to free Janet
and go to Mindy's. Agreed?

253
00:11:56,632 --> 00:11:58,467
Yeah. Michael sucks now.

254
00:11:58,551 --> 00:12:01,512
He pretended to be our friend,
he's gonna torture us for eternity

255
00:12:01,595 --> 00:12:03,264
and you know what the worst part is?

256
00:12:03,347 --> 00:12:06,308
He's forgotten
my favorite football player's name.

257
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:09,019
-Definitely not the worst part.
-It is to me!

258
00:12:09,103 --> 00:12:13,357
Blake Bortles is a cool name.
Derek Bortles is a dumb name.

259
00:12:15,818 --> 00:12:18,988
-[dragon growling]
-[people screaming indistinctly]

260
00:12:19,864 --> 00:12:21,532
[inaudible]

261
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:28,164
Hey, man. Have you told Shawn
how hugely important I was yet?

262
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:31,959
I will get to it. Promise.
Now you just relax, enjoy yourself.

263
00:12:32,042 --> 00:12:34,420
Rip a cat in half. It's a party.
Come on!

264
00:12:36,714 --> 00:12:37,882
-Hey!
-[exclaims]

265
00:12:37,965 --> 00:12:39,383
What does Michael keep whispering to you?

266
00:12:39,467 --> 00:12:43,053
Um, something, something, Vicky.
Something, something.

267
00:12:43,137 --> 00:12:45,347
-Uh, can I braid your hair?
-No.

268
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:47,224
-Please.
-No. I got it.

269
00:12:47,308 --> 00:12:48,309
-Hey!
-Ooh!

270
00:12:48,392 --> 00:12:50,478
Help me get these bracelets
off Good Janet.

271
00:12:50,561 --> 00:12:54,064
No. Shawn put them on for a reason.
I'm not overruling him.

272
00:12:54,148 --> 00:12:56,066
-You're such a suck-up, Gayle.
-[scoffs]

273
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:58,694
-Can I braid your hair?
-No. I got it.

274
00:12:58,777 --> 00:13:02,281
-Okay... [groans]
-Ow! Get your own bracelets, Victoria.

275
00:13:05,868 --> 00:13:10,039
Okay, you fat dinks, the sun is up,
and we're about to close it down

276
00:13:10,122 --> 00:13:11,874
with one last song.

277
00:13:11,957 --> 00:13:17,338
"She Hates Me" by Puddle of Mudd
and "Grandma Got Run Over By A Reindeer"

278
00:13:17,421 --> 00:13:19,173
played at the same time.

279
00:13:20,382 --> 00:13:23,344
Honestly, I'm still partial
to the old-fashioned scorpion diapers,

280
00:13:23,427 --> 00:13:24,929
but you've done great work here.

281
00:13:25,012 --> 00:13:27,515
Can't thank you enough for everything.

282
00:13:27,598 --> 00:13:29,517
-Shawn, wait.
-No--

283
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,727
I have some very interesting information,

284
00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:33,729
about who is really responsible
for this neighborhood.

285
00:13:33,812 --> 00:13:35,523
The humans are escaping.

286
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:40,361
It's Michael.

287
00:13:40,444 --> 00:13:43,447
He's responsible for this neighborhood
and everything that's happening right now.

288
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:44,365
Bye!

289
00:13:44,448 --> 00:13:46,242
-[sighs] I--
-Bad Janet!

290
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:48,452
What's cracking, nutbutts?

291
00:13:48,536 --> 00:13:52,081
Call us another train, immediately.
Party's over.

292
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:53,999
[brakes screeching]

293
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:56,460
How did they get Janet's bracelets off?

294
00:13:56,544 --> 00:13:58,712
It's impossible for a human to do.

295
00:13:58,796 --> 00:14:02,299
It's like breathing underwater
or driving without texting.

296
00:14:02,383 --> 00:14:06,011
Shawn, I don't wanna make any accusations,
but I accuse Vicky.

297
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:08,472
She asked me to help her
take Janet's bracelets off.

298
00:14:08,556 --> 00:14:10,641
Oh, Vicky, you didn't.

299
00:14:10,724 --> 00:14:12,768
She definitely did. She's jealous.

300
00:14:12,851 --> 00:14:15,312
She's been trying to sabotage me
the entire time.

301
00:14:15,396 --> 00:14:17,022
What? No. He's lying.

302
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:20,442
Okay, I did try to get the bracelets off,
but I couldn't!

303
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:22,236
Listen to yourself.
You sound crazy.

304
00:14:22,319 --> 00:14:26,365
Normally, I would love hearing a man
tell a woman she's crazy, but I can't.

305
00:14:26,448 --> 00:14:28,617
You aided the humans to spite Michael.

306
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:30,661
You're no demon.
You're a jerk.

307
00:14:30,744 --> 00:14:33,664
Wait, this is a trick.
Michael is the traitor.

308
00:14:33,747 --> 00:14:38,085
I bet they're still here.
This place stretches for a thousand miles.

309
00:14:38,168 --> 00:14:40,045
Fine. Bad Janet?

310
00:14:40,129 --> 00:14:41,547
What?

311
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:43,465
Scan the neighborhood, please.

312
00:14:51,015 --> 00:14:54,143
No sign of humans,
but I did find something for Vicky.

313
00:14:54,226 --> 00:14:55,060
What?

314
00:14:55,144 --> 00:14:56,437
[farts]

315
00:14:57,271 --> 00:14:59,356
[both chuckle]

316
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,567
-Bad Janet, great stuff as always.
-No, duh.

317
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:02,818
And as for you...

318
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:04,028
[Vicky] No, wait.

319
00:15:05,112 --> 00:15:08,324
This is a PR disaster.
We have to keep it under wraps.

320
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:09,325
Get her on the train.

321
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:13,287
And if anyone else says a word
of what happened here to anyone,

322
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:18,250
you will be in a cocoon, just like Vicky,
and it is gooey in there.

323
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:20,377
How do we get the humans back
from Mindy's?

324
00:15:20,461 --> 00:15:22,713
They bought themselves some time,
but we'll get them.

325
00:15:22,796 --> 00:15:25,132
I'll start the extradition papers.
You stay here.

326
00:15:25,215 --> 00:15:27,593
I want every trace
of this neighborhood erased.

327
00:15:37,978 --> 00:15:39,271
[grunts] That was a bad idea!

328
00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:41,023
That was so scary,
so many different times.

329
00:15:41,106 --> 00:15:42,691
I hated that.

330
00:15:45,903 --> 00:15:50,532
You guys!
I was so scared for you. [crying]

331
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:52,368
Told you he was on our side!

332
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:56,956
[crying] You're my friends
and I wanted to save you.

333
00:15:57,039 --> 00:15:58,499
[Eleanor] Hey, it's okay, bud.

334
00:15:58,582 --> 00:16:01,543
This is the best summer ever, you guys.

335
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:03,337
[Janet and Michael crying]

336
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:05,297
Oh.

337
00:16:06,382 --> 00:16:08,801
Oh, Michael, we never doubted you.

338
00:16:08,884 --> 00:16:11,428
Thank you, Tahani.
You're lying, right?

339
00:16:11,512 --> 00:16:13,305
Yes. I doubted you very strongly.

340
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:16,976
But then I figured it out.
Kierkegaard, baby! Leap of faith.

341
00:16:17,059 --> 00:16:20,020
It's better translated
as "a leap into faith."

342
00:16:20,104 --> 00:16:21,146
You remembered.

343
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:25,109
-[Michael laughing]
-Can somebody explain what happened?

344
00:16:25,192 --> 00:16:27,695
And can you guys be a tiny bit quieter?

345
00:16:27,778 --> 00:16:30,239
I've been drunk on magnets all day

346
00:16:30,322 --> 00:16:33,826
and I can literally hear
every sound in the universe.

347
00:16:33,909 --> 00:16:37,788
Basically, Michael sent us a code
and we had to crack it.

348
00:16:37,871 --> 00:16:40,249
-I figured out the first clue.
-No. I did.

349
00:16:40,874 --> 00:16:42,334
-I was there, though.
-[Janet] Oh!

350
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:46,380
Blake Bortles is a cool name.
Derek Bortles is a dumb name.

351
00:16:46,463 --> 00:16:47,965
Yes.

352
00:16:48,048 --> 00:16:53,137
Derek Bortles is indeed a very dumb name.

353
00:16:53,721 --> 00:16:57,683
It's a clue. There's no way Michael
would've forgotten that name.

354
00:16:57,766 --> 00:16:59,435
You say it a million times a day.

355
00:16:59,518 --> 00:17:02,479
-'Cause he's the best.
-He's not. Even I know that.

356
00:17:02,563 --> 00:17:06,859
Michael was telling us to use Derek,
Janet's Derek, for something.

357
00:17:06,942 --> 00:17:09,111
There were clues in the roast.

358
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:12,865
Everybody, quietly but quickly,
head to the train station.

359
00:17:12,948 --> 00:17:15,159
Let's split up so we don't draw attention.

360
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:25,753
Ugh. You guys are the worst conspirators.

361
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:30,174
What else did Michael say in the roasts

362
00:17:30,257 --> 00:17:32,593
that might be meaningful?
Tahani, do you remember?

363
00:17:32,676 --> 00:17:35,304
Well, he said my entire life
was pointless and empty.

364
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:37,514
Yeah, but did he say anything
we don't already know?

365
00:17:37,598 --> 00:17:39,558
Anything that stood out?

366
00:17:39,641 --> 00:17:43,562
You know what the worst moment
of Tahani's life was?

367
00:17:43,645 --> 00:17:46,565
When the last song played
at one of her parties,

368
00:17:46,648 --> 00:17:48,525
and she would run off and cry

369
00:17:48,609 --> 00:17:50,861
because she still hadn't won
her parents' approval.

370
00:17:50,944 --> 00:17:52,362
That was odd.

371
00:17:52,446 --> 00:17:54,990
A host never runs off
during the last song.

372
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:57,034
Because after it's over,
you're supposed to act surprised

373
00:17:57,117 --> 00:17:59,495
when everyone drags you onstage
and showers you with applause.

374
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:02,748
Maybe Michael wanted us to wait
until the end of the party

375
00:18:02,831 --> 00:18:04,958
when everyone is most distracted.

376
00:18:05,042 --> 00:18:06,418
And use Derek to drive the train

377
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:09,171
because he has
some of Janet's powers. Janet?

378
00:18:09,254 --> 00:18:11,173
Hi. Hey. Hey.

379
00:18:11,256 --> 00:18:12,091
-[Eleanor] Janet?
-Yep?

380
00:18:12,174 --> 00:18:14,468
You need to get Derek from your void.

381
00:18:14,551 --> 00:18:18,097
Okay. Shoot, where's my void, again?
I forget.

382
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:23,477
Oh, yeah, it's everywhere.
Okay, hang on to your butt cheeks.

383
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:25,437
-[beeps]
<i>-Ugh. Where is he?</i>

384
00:18:25,521 --> 00:18:27,397
-[objects clattering]
<i>-Ow. Owie. </i>[groans]

385
00:18:27,481 --> 00:18:29,525
<i>I'm never gonna find...</i>
<i>Oh, there he is.</i>

386
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:30,651
-Derek.
-Hmm.

387
00:18:30,734 --> 00:18:34,863
Derek, we need you to drive this train
and take us to Mindy St. Claire's house.

388
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:37,366
-Can you do that?
-[scoffs] Derek.

389
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:38,450
[all chuckle]

390
00:18:39,243 --> 00:18:41,620
Wait. Nobody get on that train.

391
00:18:41,703 --> 00:18:43,747
-Derek?
-Why not?

392
00:18:43,831 --> 00:18:45,207
Because of what Michael said to me.

393
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:48,293
You thought you deserved a Medium Place?

394
00:18:48,377 --> 00:18:52,339
You're bad, Eleanor.
This is exactly the place you should be.

395
00:18:52,422 --> 00:18:53,841
Derek.

396
00:18:53,924 --> 00:18:56,218
Michael wants us to stay here,
for some reason.

397
00:18:56,301 --> 00:18:59,847
Eleanor, we have a train, a conductor
and a safe destination.

398
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:02,015
I'm going to tell you the same thing
I told Pippa Middleton

399
00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:04,351
right before we went paragliding
in Gibraltar.

400
00:19:04,434 --> 00:19:07,980
"Let's go." What? It's what I said.

401
00:19:08,063 --> 00:19:09,439
Guys, leap of faith.

402
00:19:09,523 --> 00:19:11,525
Michael said
we shouldn't get on that train.

403
00:19:11,608 --> 00:19:13,652
Any minute now, those demons
are gonna come looking for us.

404
00:19:13,735 --> 00:19:16,405
Where are we supposed to hide?
Oh, no!

405
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:18,407
Now, when you taught the trolley problem,

406
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:23,912
did you secretly wish that it could be you
who wound up under the trolley?

407
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:25,914
Because all your students did.

408
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:28,834
-Uh-uh.
-All aboard!

409
00:19:28,917 --> 00:19:32,921
-[shushing]
-The train is here! It's a train!

410
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:35,465
Get on board.

411
00:19:35,549 --> 00:19:37,176
-Actually, Derek--
-Derek.

412
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:38,927
You're gonna wait
until the last song of the night.

413
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:40,012
Derek.

414
00:19:40,095 --> 00:19:42,890
And when you leave, you'll be flying solo.

415
00:19:42,973 --> 00:19:46,059
Oh. Maximum Derek.

416
00:19:46,143 --> 00:19:48,604
Derek headed off.
And when the new train arrived,

417
00:19:48,687 --> 00:19:52,107
the four of us crawled underneath
before any of the drunk demons saw us.

418
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:55,152
<i>That kept us from being detected</i>
<i>when Bad Janet scanned the neighborhood.</i>

419
00:19:55,235 --> 00:19:58,155
<i>We fooled those mofos</i>
<i>like the chumps they are.</i>

420
00:19:58,238 --> 00:20:00,324
We got all four clues you left us.

421
00:20:00,407 --> 00:20:05,787
Oh, that's great.
Actually, I left you more than 1,200 clues

422
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:07,956
because of how primitive your brains are,

423
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:10,667
but I'm glad you got enough
to figure it out.

424
00:20:10,751 --> 00:20:12,961
How did you escape detection though?

425
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:17,299
I'm not ethically proud of this,
but I framed Vicky.

426
00:20:17,382 --> 00:20:21,887
It was easy. I kept whispering things
into Janet's ear to make her paranoid.

427
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:24,848
I'm sorry. What did you whisper to me?
I don't remember.

428
00:20:26,433 --> 00:20:29,436
[whispers] Something, something, Vicky.
Something, something.

429
00:20:29,519 --> 00:20:31,188
What does Michael keep whispering to you?

430
00:20:31,271 --> 00:20:35,275
Something, something, Vicky.
Something, something. [exclaims]

431
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:37,903
[Michael] <i>And that made her</i>
<i>try to take Janet's bracelets off,</i>

432
00:20:37,986 --> 00:20:39,529
which framed her for the escape.

433
00:20:39,613 --> 00:20:41,114
[all] Oh!

434
00:20:41,198 --> 00:20:45,077
Guys, I want to apologize
for roasting you earlier.

435
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:47,788
I had to sell it
since everyone was watching.

436
00:20:47,871 --> 00:20:49,289
It was funny, right?

437
00:20:49,373 --> 00:20:51,959
{\an8}-Absolutely not.
-The Tahani stuff was perfect. I mean, no.

438
00:20:52,042 --> 00:20:55,504
{\an8}Guys, let's just take a moment here.
[chuckles] They're gone.

439
00:20:55,587 --> 00:20:59,258
{\an8}Which means that we won
and might actually get a chance

440
00:20:59,341 --> 00:21:00,759
{\an8}to go to the real Good Place.

441
00:21:00,842 --> 00:21:03,512
{\an8}This is everything we ever wanted.

442
00:21:03,595 --> 00:21:08,058
{\an8}Speaking of which,
I really hope Mindy liked our present.

443
00:21:08,141 --> 00:21:09,476
{\an8}[knocking at door]

444
00:21:10,644 --> 00:21:11,478
{\an8}Who are you?

445
00:21:11,561 --> 00:21:12,604
{\an8}Derek.

446
00:21:14,815 --> 00:21:16,984
{\an8}"Thanks for helping us
all those times we showed up.

447
00:21:17,067 --> 00:21:20,904
{\an8}To repay you, here's a willing sex robot
and two duffel bags full of cocaine."

448
00:21:21,488 --> 00:21:24,324
There are wind chimes
where my ding-dong should be.

449
00:21:24,408 --> 00:21:25,867
[wind chimes tinkling]

450
00:21:26,827 --> 00:21:29,246
-I can work with that.
-All right.
