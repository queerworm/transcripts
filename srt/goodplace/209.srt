1
00:00:01,501 --> 00:00:05,213
I don't know about you guys, but I say
we leave this miserable shirthole.

2
00:00:05,296 --> 00:00:07,132
No. Wait. Wait. Not so fast.

3
00:00:07,215 --> 00:00:10,301
Now getting to the Good Place
is pretty tricky.

4
00:00:10,385 --> 00:00:11,845
There's no train to catch.

5
00:00:11,928 --> 00:00:16,433
I have to design a complicated,
unique transportation vehicle.

6
00:00:16,516 --> 00:00:18,810
-Is it Optimus Prime?
-What?

7
00:00:18,893 --> 00:00:21,312
I can't believe we get to ride
a real-life Optimus Prime!

8
00:00:21,396 --> 00:00:24,941
I call right nipple!
That's shotgun on Optimus Prime.

9
00:00:25,024 --> 00:00:28,862
Look, this vehicle, which is
decidedly not Optimus Prime...

10
00:00:28,945 --> 00:00:29,946
[groans]

11
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:32,741
...has never been built before.
So I'll need a few days to do this.

12
00:00:32,824 --> 00:00:35,660
Dude, we just escaped
by the skin of our teeth,

13
00:00:35,744 --> 00:00:39,247
and any second now, Shawn is gonna realize
that we're not at Mindy St. Claire's.

14
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:42,834
So whatever this magical
Good Place-mobile is,

15
00:00:42,917 --> 00:00:44,669
now's the time to whip it out, B!

16
00:00:44,753 --> 00:00:47,338
I agree. And I believe
I've asked you this already--

17
00:00:47,422 --> 00:00:48,798
There is no business class.

18
00:00:48,882 --> 00:00:50,717
Michael, they're right.
We gotta go.

19
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:55,221
Oh... [mumbles]

20
00:00:55,305 --> 00:00:57,932
Okay, here goes nothing.
Janet, if you would?

21
00:00:58,016 --> 00:01:00,477
And presto!

22
00:01:02,145 --> 00:01:03,188
[beeps]

23
00:01:03,271 --> 00:01:07,984
Oops, forgot to log in first.
Gotta answer my security question.

24
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:13,990
"What was the name of your childhood pet?"
Korzoff, the ten-headed dog-spider.

25
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:17,327
And presto!

26
00:01:19,788 --> 00:01:21,247
[Jason] Dope!

27
00:01:21,331 --> 00:01:25,585
[Eleanor] We did it, guys. We won.
We're going to the Good Place.

28
00:01:25,668 --> 00:01:28,505
-In a frickin' gold balloon.
-Shotgun!

29
00:01:28,588 --> 00:01:30,632
[Chidi] It's a hot air balloon.
What does that even mean?

30
00:01:30,715 --> 00:01:34,636
Top of the balloon!
Ultimate shotgun.

31
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:36,721
[theme music playing]

32
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:45,146
{\an8}So many memories of this place.
Eating frozen yogurt,

33
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:47,941
{\an8}and then having diarrhea,
and then eating more frozen yogurt,

34
00:01:48,024 --> 00:01:49,526
{\an8}and then more diarrhea.

35
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:52,112
{\an8}Maybe I should've realized
this wasn't the Good Place

36
00:01:52,195 --> 00:01:53,404
{\an8}because of all the diarrhea.

37
00:01:53,488 --> 00:01:56,032
{\an8}Maybe you shouldn't be eating
all that frozen yogurt right now.

38
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:58,118
{\an8}We're about to be on a balloon.

39
00:01:58,201 --> 00:02:00,203
{\an8}[Eleanor] What do you think
our new home will be like?

40
00:02:00,286 --> 00:02:05,834
{\an8}I'm picturing Hawaiian beach,
unlimited Mai Tais and a phone.

41
00:02:05,917 --> 00:02:09,838
{\an8}Oh, I miss my phone so much.
I bet I have so many texts.

42
00:02:09,921 --> 00:02:12,715
{\an8}I just want us all to be together.
Separate houses, obviously.

43
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:16,427
{\an8}Large lawns.
I'd have a tasteful moat. [chuckles]

44
00:02:16,511 --> 00:02:20,723
{\an8}I don't care where I live as long as
they have more of this frozen yogurt.

45
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:22,100
{\an8}Why? Why?

46
00:02:22,183 --> 00:02:24,978
{\an8}An unlimited library.

47
00:02:25,061 --> 00:02:27,355
{\an8}All of my philosopher heroes
walking around,

48
00:02:27,438 --> 00:02:29,732
{\an8}waiting to be engaged
in rigorous intellectual debate.

49
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:32,152
{\an8}I hope that library is air-conditioned,

50
00:02:32,235 --> 00:02:35,071
{\an8}because we are gonna be
working up quite a sweat.

51
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:38,658
Oh! And soulmates.
I hope they're real.

52
00:02:38,741 --> 00:02:41,953
[stammering] I mean, you know,
for all of us.

53
00:02:42,036 --> 00:02:45,999
I hope everyone gets someone special.

54
00:02:46,082 --> 00:02:48,626
Good news.
We've got a handle on the controls.

55
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:50,628
Who's ready to go balloonin'?

56
00:02:50,712 --> 00:02:53,089
Okay, I think we figured it out.

57
00:02:53,172 --> 00:02:56,301
I pieced together this design from
a number of ancient manuscripts,

58
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:58,511
which Janet will now interpret for you.

59
00:02:58,595 --> 00:03:02,557
"The balloon will only transport those
who have attained self-realization.

60
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:06,269
Each traveler will step upon the scale,
and her soul shall be weighed.

61
00:03:06,352 --> 00:03:09,814
If she is the best version of herself,
it will permit her to board.

62
00:03:09,898 --> 00:03:11,941
If not, passage will be denied."

63
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:15,820
Cool. Cool. Cool. We got this.

64
00:03:15,904 --> 00:03:19,949
I don't know about you guys, but I am
definitely the best version of myself.

65
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:23,995
I know a shirt-ton about ethics now
'cause I studied.

66
00:03:24,078 --> 00:03:28,625
And I read books that weren't even written
by the Real Housewives.

67
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:32,128
Relax, everyone.
We're all gonna be fine.

68
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:36,216
-[dings]
-Oh!

69
00:03:37,175 --> 00:03:40,303
I didn't believe anything I was saying.
Whoo! In I go.

70
00:03:40,386 --> 00:03:41,679
[sighs]

71
00:03:44,015 --> 00:03:46,601
-[dings]
-[sighs] Well...

72
00:03:52,023 --> 00:03:53,983
-[dings]
-Oh, dip!

73
00:03:57,612 --> 00:03:59,322
Ah, nuts!

74
00:03:59,405 --> 00:04:02,325
It's okay. The pattern is
green-green-green-red.

75
00:04:02,408 --> 00:04:03,993
Remember that when it starts up again.

76
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:07,121
I'm sorry, everyone.
I just have some worries,

77
00:04:07,205 --> 00:04:10,625
as well as some concerns, that could
potentially turn into outright fears.

78
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:13,169
Oh, there they go.
Uh, they're fears now.

79
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:17,465
Okay, I know this mood.
Come with us, Dr. Freakout.

80
00:04:17,548 --> 00:04:20,677
That was a joke.
We're actually very good friends.

81
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,053
Here's the thing,

82
00:04:22,136 --> 00:04:25,598
that balloon wants us to be
the best version of ourselves,

83
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:27,809
but for the four of us,
that's not just a metaphor.

84
00:04:27,892 --> 00:04:32,146
There have been literally
802 different versions of us.

85
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:34,983
And how do I know that this version
is the best version of myself?

86
00:04:35,066 --> 00:04:39,445
How do I know it's not version number 85
or 322 or 558?

87
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:41,030
Or 69 or 420!

88
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:44,158
Then you get into
the whole idea of consciousness.

89
00:04:44,242 --> 00:04:47,620
You just forget about best and
what version of Chidi is even real?

90
00:04:47,704 --> 00:04:49,706
What happens here?
Does he eventually tire himself out?

91
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:53,251
Usually, but this one seems to be
getting stronger as he goes on.

92
00:04:53,334 --> 00:04:56,254
...and this Chidi is an impostor.

93
00:04:56,337 --> 00:04:58,548
Okay. This is pretty simple, bud.

94
00:04:58,631 --> 00:05:03,094
You've been our teacher this whole time.
We are much better because of you.

95
00:05:03,177 --> 00:05:05,680
If we're the best versions of ourselves,

96
00:05:05,763 --> 00:05:10,476
which that balloon just proved,
then you definitely are.

97
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:16,607
So, in a way, it doesn't matter if
I was better in version 492 or whatever

98
00:05:16,691 --> 00:05:19,360
because the best version
of me is just as much

99
00:05:19,444 --> 00:05:21,487
about my effect on the world around me,

100
00:05:21,571 --> 00:05:25,199
as it is about
my own egocentric self-image.

101
00:05:26,117 --> 00:05:28,119
I really meant that much to you guys?

102
00:05:28,202 --> 00:05:31,956
Of course you did. Now let's get you
back on that scale, dorkus.

103
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,291
[Eleanor chuckles]

104
00:05:36,294 --> 00:05:38,463
Chidi, ready to try again?

105
00:05:38,546 --> 00:05:40,882
Yeah! All right.

106
00:05:42,967 --> 00:05:43,926
-[dings]
-Ah!

107
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:45,595
-[all chuckle]
-[grunts]

108
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:50,850
-[dings]
-[sighs]

109
00:05:55,146 --> 00:05:56,564
-[dings]
-Dope!

110
00:06:01,402 --> 00:06:04,113
[groans] Chidi got in my head.

111
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:08,534
It's just that thing Chidi said
about previous versions of myself,

112
00:06:08,618 --> 00:06:10,870
it's screwing me up.
But I can fix it.

113
00:06:11,829 --> 00:06:13,706
[breathes heavily] Whoo!

114
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:16,542
I stole this from your house
the first night we were here.

115
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:19,003
Should be the best version of myself now.

116
00:06:20,922 --> 00:06:22,840
[groans] Come on, scale, be cool!

117
00:06:22,924 --> 00:06:24,550
Guys, we're just not ready.

118
00:06:24,634 --> 00:06:26,552
I think we should regroup
and try again tomorrow.

119
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:30,139
Hang on. I know the answer.
I know why I'm not my best self.

120
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:34,393
Do you remember that version of me
from the tape of us at Mindy's?

121
00:06:34,477 --> 00:06:38,856
Where I was vulnerable
and emotional and honest?

122
00:06:39,774 --> 00:06:43,111
That Eleanor is a better
Eleanor than this one.

123
00:06:43,194 --> 00:06:45,571
That is not an easy thing for me to say.

124
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:48,574
"You're not better than me"
was my yearbook quote.

125
00:06:48,658 --> 00:06:49,659
[chuckles]

126
00:06:49,742 --> 00:06:52,245
Michael, can you tell us
a little bit about that version?

127
00:06:52,328 --> 00:06:57,500
Uh, reboot number 119.
All the restaurants were kebab places.

128
00:06:57,583 --> 00:07:00,670
You had a pet lizard,
which I made poop on you all the time.

129
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:04,757
No. Can you tell us more about Chidi's
and my relationship from that version?

130
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:09,387
Sorry. You got really into ethics
and you spent a lot of time together.

131
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:13,724
Once, you handed him a tissue
right before he sneezed,

132
00:07:13,808 --> 00:07:18,479
and that simple act of anticipating
his needs made him fall for you.

133
00:07:18,563 --> 00:07:23,818
One night, you took a walk along the lake
and you had your first kiss.

134
00:07:23,901 --> 00:07:28,364
Which... gross.
Kissing is gross.

135
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:32,618
You just mash your food holes together.
It's not for that.

136
00:07:33,202 --> 00:07:38,291
Anyway, it, uh... it just, you know,
bloomed after that.

137
00:07:38,374 --> 00:07:41,461
There are obviously
some undealt-with issues here.

138
00:07:41,544 --> 00:07:45,923
I propose that everyone who is green
go ahead and board the magic balloon

139
00:07:46,007 --> 00:07:47,425
and set out to the Good Place.

140
00:07:47,508 --> 00:07:49,260
Sort of like an advance team.

141
00:07:49,343 --> 00:07:52,180
We'll put our names in
or book a table, however it works,

142
00:07:52,263 --> 00:07:54,182
and then we'll send back
the magical balloon

143
00:07:54,265 --> 00:07:57,602
for the red-light people later on.
It's a perfect plan.

144
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:02,190
No! It's not working.
It probably thinks I'm Eleanor.

145
00:08:02,273 --> 00:08:04,859
It is I, Tahani.

146
00:08:04,942 --> 00:08:09,113
If you were wondering, I am,
by definition, the best version of myself

147
00:08:09,197 --> 00:08:10,907
because my operating system
is always updating.

148
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:12,992
I'm not sure that's true, Janet.

149
00:08:13,075 --> 00:08:15,953
You still haven't talked to Jason
about your romantic baggage.

150
00:08:16,037 --> 00:08:19,415
And the three of you are in
some sort of weird love triangle.

151
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:22,627
You don't know what you're talking about.
Also, love isn't a triangle.

152
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:24,587
It's a five-dimensional blob. So...

153
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:26,631
Okay. If you're so perfect,
step on the scale.

154
00:08:26,714 --> 00:08:27,673
Fine.

155
00:08:28,299 --> 00:08:29,717
[chimes and blasts]

156
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:33,221
-Ooh, I think I broke it.
-No! My beautiful balloon scale!

157
00:08:33,304 --> 00:08:36,224
-It's not yours!
-No, no. Please, stop fighting.

158
00:08:36,307 --> 00:08:38,643
Oh, man. This stinks.

159
00:08:38,726 --> 00:08:41,020
I'm having this feeling where...
What is it called?

160
00:08:41,103 --> 00:08:44,899
[stammering] You know where you
did a thing and you're sad after it?

161
00:08:44,982 --> 00:08:49,737
After-sad? Is that... No.
You humans have so many emotions!

162
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:53,115
You only need two, anger and confusion!

163
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:54,700
Michael, what's going on?

164
00:08:54,784 --> 00:08:57,870
The problem isn't any of you.
It... [sighs]

165
00:08:57,954 --> 00:09:00,039
This whole balloon thing is a fake.

166
00:09:00,122 --> 00:09:04,710
The truth is I have no idea how to get
into the Good Place and I never have.

167
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:13,302
Well, Michael's right.
I'm angry and confused.

168
00:09:15,763 --> 00:09:20,643
So, months ago, when you said
you had this whole complicated plan

169
00:09:20,726 --> 00:09:22,436
-for getting us to the Good Place--
-It was a lie.

170
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:27,024
I assumed if I bought myself some time,
I could figure out a way in.

171
00:09:27,108 --> 00:09:29,986
Guys, I tried a billion different ways.

172
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:34,323
Not an exaggeration. I actually tried
one billion and 12 different plans.

173
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:39,579
But the only way into the Good Place
is by being a good person on Earth.

174
00:09:39,662 --> 00:09:42,748
This is unforgivable.
How many times can you betray us?

175
00:09:42,832 --> 00:09:44,709
I'm sorry. I really am.

176
00:09:44,792 --> 00:09:47,712
Because while I was searching
for a way to get in,

177
00:09:47,795 --> 00:09:52,216
I was also taking your ethics classes,
learning why it was bad to lie.

178
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:55,303
So not only did I fail at
getting us into the Good Place,

179
00:09:55,386 --> 00:09:58,055
I also learned the error of my ways.

180
00:09:58,139 --> 00:10:01,601
Real rock bottom for a demon,
I'll tell ya.

181
00:10:01,684 --> 00:10:03,352
But this was not torture!

182
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:06,814
I was stalling, so I could
keep searching for a way in.

183
00:10:06,897 --> 00:10:09,942
I would've been happy if you were
to live in this neighborhood forever,

184
00:10:10,026 --> 00:10:13,279
but then Shawn came
and just ruined the whole thing.

185
00:10:13,362 --> 00:10:16,115
So what happens now?

186
00:10:16,198 --> 00:10:19,118
Shawn will eventually figure out
you're not at Mindy's,

187
00:10:19,201 --> 00:10:24,248
and he'll realize that someone
on the inside was helping you.

188
00:10:24,332 --> 00:10:28,878
So, you'll go to the real Bad Place
forever, and I will be retired.

189
00:10:28,961 --> 00:10:30,087
You're mad at me.

190
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:34,467
I'm not mad.
I'm just disappointed.

191
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:37,219
Oh, come on, everyone knows that's worse.

192
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:41,557
So, this really is the end.
Completely out of options, are we?

193
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:44,518
Not completely out of options.

194
00:10:44,602 --> 00:10:49,065
We can do what the Shellstrops
have always done

195
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:50,941
when the chips are down...

196
00:10:51,025 --> 00:10:54,362
ignore our problems and drink heavily.

197
00:10:54,445 --> 00:10:58,491
Janet! A million bottles
of your finest booze, please!

198
00:10:58,574 --> 00:11:00,284
[soft music playing]

199
00:11:00,368 --> 00:11:02,078
You all right?

200
00:11:03,037 --> 00:11:04,163
Kind of.

201
00:11:04,246 --> 00:11:08,292
I asked Michael if I could pop
the giant balloon and he said no.

202
00:11:08,376 --> 00:11:11,253
Then I asked if I could
suck the helium out of it

203
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:14,131
to make my voice sound funny
so it cheers everyone up,

204
00:11:14,215 --> 00:11:17,093
and he just kind of sighed
and walked away,

205
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:20,596
so I guess that one is still on the table.

206
00:11:22,056 --> 00:11:24,183
Are you and me cool?

207
00:11:24,266 --> 00:11:25,393
Not exactly.

208
00:11:25,476 --> 00:11:30,523
I think perhaps, given everything,
it's best we end our relationship.

209
00:11:31,315 --> 00:11:33,234
It's probably about time
I stopped relying on others

210
00:11:33,317 --> 00:11:36,695
for my sense of self-worth or happiness.

211
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:41,033
You know, my whole life,
whenever I encountered any obstacles,

212
00:11:41,117 --> 00:11:42,910
I would simply say,

213
00:11:43,828 --> 00:11:45,663
"I would like to speak to your manager."

214
00:11:45,746 --> 00:11:48,249
In our relationship, there is no manager.

215
00:11:48,332 --> 00:11:52,586
There is no one who can fix this for me,
except me.

216
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:57,842
My mom was a manager at a pet store.
Does that help?

217
00:11:57,925 --> 00:12:00,803
No, and please don't launch into one of--

218
00:12:00,886 --> 00:12:03,764
-She got fired after I robbed...
-No, Jason. Please...

219
00:12:03,848 --> 00:12:05,724
-We actually robbed it together.
-Please, stop.

220
00:12:05,808 --> 00:12:09,270
Long story short, it was all a dream.

221
00:12:09,353 --> 00:12:15,025
Thank you, Jason, for making this moment
a little easier for me.

222
00:12:17,862 --> 00:12:21,031
Dude, here's where I'm at.
Feelings are stupid.

223
00:12:21,115 --> 00:12:22,783
Yeah. Who needs them?

224
00:12:22,867 --> 00:12:26,579
But, uh, in case feelings aren't stupid,

225
00:12:26,662 --> 00:12:29,039
and in the case that
we are eternally doomed,

226
00:12:29,123 --> 00:12:34,712
I thought it might be worth mentioning
that I do have feelings for you.

227
00:12:34,795 --> 00:12:36,755
And I know you don't feel the same way.

228
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:42,261
And although that fills me
with anger and confusion...

229
00:12:43,095 --> 00:12:44,597
Wow, Michael was right on the money.

230
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:48,642
I just wanted you to know the truth.

231
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:52,229
-You are, I mean--
-No, don't say anything.

232
00:12:52,313 --> 00:12:54,940
-Don't, don't.
-I want to. I want to.

233
00:12:55,024 --> 00:12:56,567
Here's the thing about me.

234
00:12:56,650 --> 00:13:00,279
You know the sound that
a fork makes in the garbage disposal?

235
00:13:01,405 --> 00:13:05,993
That's the sound
that my brain makes all the time.

236
00:13:06,076 --> 00:13:07,786
Just this constant grinding

237
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:11,707
about things I'm afraid of
or things that I want

238
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:16,086
or want to want,
or want to want to want...

239
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:17,546
Is it grinding in there right now?

240
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:19,340
Yeah, but the point is

241
00:13:19,423 --> 00:13:24,261
the circumstances under which we met
are completely insane

242
00:13:24,345 --> 00:13:27,097
and that just makes the grinding harder.

243
00:13:27,181 --> 00:13:29,642
I wish we'd met
the way normal people meet,

244
00:13:29,725 --> 00:13:33,896
like at a philosophy conference
or after one of my philosophy lectures,

245
00:13:33,979 --> 00:13:36,774
or you came knocking on my office door,

246
00:13:36,857 --> 00:13:38,609
-asking for help with philosophy.
-[laughing]

247
00:13:38,692 --> 00:13:43,364
-Is that how you think people meet?
-I don't know how normal people meet.

248
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:45,783
[Eleanor] You're such a nerd.

249
00:13:46,992 --> 00:13:48,994
Attention, everyone!

250
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:52,790
We may not know exactly
which version of ourselves

251
00:13:52,873 --> 00:13:55,793
was technically our best self,
but you know what?

252
00:13:55,876 --> 00:13:57,169
I like who we are right now.

253
00:13:57,253 --> 00:14:01,215
To this version of us.
To the good people we've all become.

254
00:14:01,298 --> 00:14:04,510
Ooh, and to Eleanor,
our unofficial leader.

255
00:14:04,593 --> 00:14:07,846
You pack a lot of heart and grit
into that diminutive frame.

256
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:10,558
Like a scrappy little auto mechanic.
[chuckles]

257
00:14:10,641 --> 00:14:13,394
That's the nicest thing you've ever
said to me, babe, and I'll take it.

258
00:14:13,477 --> 00:14:16,272
-And to Janet! The best robot.
-Not a robot.

259
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:17,565
-Girl.
-Not a girl.

260
00:14:17,648 --> 00:14:19,900
-And straight up hottie!
-I am attractive, yes.

261
00:14:19,984 --> 00:14:23,362
-Any of us could have ever asked for.
-Thanks, guys.

262
00:14:23,445 --> 00:14:25,781
Because of the way we
were conceived of and created,

263
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:28,367
Janets don't typically give speeches.

264
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:32,079
Oh, she's done.
She's not gonna give a speech.

265
00:14:32,162 --> 00:14:35,249
-Okay, cool.
-One more toast. To Michael!

266
00:14:35,332 --> 00:14:36,625
-[Eleanor] Michael!
-[Jason] Michael!

267
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:37,585
[all] Whoo!

268
00:14:37,668 --> 00:14:41,547
Who is easily the best version of himself.

269
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:44,091
Granted, the bar was low.
He is a demon.

270
00:14:44,174 --> 00:14:47,428
But he made a mistake
and admitted he was wrong,

271
00:14:47,511 --> 00:14:50,681
which makes him better than
90% of all humans.

272
00:14:50,764 --> 00:14:53,309
And you know what?
It wasn't really Michael's fault.

273
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:56,228
We weren't getting
into the Good Place anyway.

274
00:14:56,312 --> 00:14:57,813
I mean, look at us.

275
00:14:57,897 --> 00:14:59,940
A self-obsessed socialite,

276
00:15:00,024 --> 00:15:03,152
a ridiculous giraffe,
an absurd British aristocrat,

277
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:06,155
-a narcissistic attention-seeker--
-Are these all me?

278
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:08,824
Yes, I was gonna do eight for you
and one for everyone else.

279
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:12,036
-[all laughing]
-The point is, Michael, we forgive you.

280
00:15:12,119 --> 00:15:15,748
I mean, at least you tried
to find a way to the Good Place.

281
00:15:15,831 --> 00:15:17,583
And that's the greatest thing
someone can do.

282
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:19,668
Just try your best.

283
00:15:20,461 --> 00:15:26,342
So, we hereby name you an honorary human,

284
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:32,014
and we would like to present you
with this human starter kit.

285
00:15:32,097 --> 00:15:36,310
Car keys. So I can lose them and say,
"Has anyone seen my car keys?"

286
00:15:36,393 --> 00:15:40,064
And then I can do that thing where you...
[laughs]

287
00:15:40,147 --> 00:15:45,361
Thank you! And Band-Aids,
for your stupid, fragile bodies.

288
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:49,990
Oh, and look at this,
a stress ball with a dumb corporate logo.

289
00:15:50,074 --> 00:15:52,326
Oh, I can't wait to keep finding this,

290
00:15:52,409 --> 00:15:55,955
and almost throw it away,
and then think, "No, I'll use it."

291
00:15:56,038 --> 00:15:57,456
[all laughing]

292
00:15:57,539 --> 00:15:59,416
Oh, guys.

293
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:03,587
A Dr. Oz diet book,
because you're all such suckers.

294
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:07,508
This is all garbage
that I have no real use for.

295
00:16:07,591 --> 00:16:10,094
That's right.
Welcome to being human.

296
00:16:10,177 --> 00:16:11,679
To Michael!

297
00:16:11,762 --> 00:16:13,806
[all cheering]

298
00:16:27,736 --> 00:16:29,530
[slow music playing]

299
00:16:45,421 --> 00:16:46,839
-[Michael] You don't remember?
-[Eleanor] No.

300
00:16:46,922 --> 00:16:49,508
-Of course you don't! [laughing]
-That's mean.

301
00:16:49,591 --> 00:16:50,843
That was version one.

302
00:16:50,926 --> 00:16:52,219
[laughing]

303
00:16:52,302 --> 00:16:53,137
Okay.

304
00:16:54,596 --> 00:16:57,349
Michael, there's a message
coming in from Shawn.

305
00:16:58,017 --> 00:16:59,893
[Michael]
"Finish shutting everything down.

306
00:16:59,977 --> 00:17:06,900
Sending train first thing tomorrow.
Humans will be captured and tortured soup.

307
00:17:06,984 --> 00:17:09,445
Sorry, autocorrect. Soon.

308
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:13,741
Although, weirdly, I did just finish
turning someone into soup.

309
00:17:13,824 --> 00:17:16,618
So random. Okay, bye."

310
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:22,541
What do you guys think
the Bad Place is going to be for you?

311
00:17:22,624 --> 00:17:25,127
I'll probably go to a Skrillex concert,

312
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:28,797
and I'll be waiting for the bass drop.
And it...

313
00:17:31,091 --> 00:17:32,509
it'll never come.

314
00:17:32,593 --> 00:17:37,848
For me, it'll be camping.
Like, I'll just always be camping.

315
00:17:37,931 --> 00:17:42,227
I am pretty good at turning
every place I go into my personal hell,

316
00:17:42,311 --> 00:17:46,023
so I think they'll have
a lot of options for me.

317
00:17:46,106 --> 00:17:50,360
Mine will obviously be
an eternity spent in the Swiss Alps.

318
00:17:50,444 --> 00:17:52,112
That sounds amazing.

319
00:17:52,196 --> 00:17:55,074
In autumn. The off-season.

320
00:17:55,157 --> 00:17:57,785
Yeah, still fine. You'd be fine.

321
00:17:57,868 --> 00:18:01,371
Who are we kidding? You'll be
running the place in a week.

322
00:18:01,455 --> 00:18:04,666
She'll be like, "Oh, hibbledy-dibbledy,
this simply won't do!

323
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,710
-I demand to speak to your manager."
-[laughing]

324
00:18:06,794 --> 00:18:08,420
[Jason] Again! Again!

325
00:18:08,504 --> 00:18:10,631
-[Eleanor] "Your manager!"
-[all laughing]

326
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:16,720
Of course! That's it.
We should speak to the manager.

327
00:18:16,804 --> 00:18:21,100
Wait, you said that there was a Judge
who decides on disputes

328
00:18:21,183 --> 00:18:22,851
between the Good Place
and the Bad Place, right?

329
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:27,397
Some sort of head honcho I could
pace in front of and plead our case to,

330
00:18:27,481 --> 00:18:30,567
and maybe even
wag a finger at disapprovingly?

331
00:18:30,651 --> 00:18:33,237
I thought about that.
It's a non-starter.

332
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:35,072
Judge rarely hears cases.

333
00:18:35,155 --> 00:18:39,409
And the only way to get to
the Judge's office is through a portal,

334
00:18:39,493 --> 00:18:42,121
and we can never get to that.

335
00:18:42,204 --> 00:18:43,288
Why not?

336
00:18:43,372 --> 00:18:47,543
We'd have to walk through
the actual Bad Place, in plain sight,

337
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:51,672
without getting caught,
reach and pass through the portal.

338
00:18:51,755 --> 00:18:54,174
Convince the Judge to hear us out,

339
00:18:54,258 --> 00:18:56,635
even though we didn't
go through the proper channels,

340
00:18:56,718 --> 00:19:01,390
and then somehow win our unwinnable case.

341
00:19:03,183 --> 00:19:06,728
[burps] Okay. Let's do it!

342
00:19:07,938 --> 00:19:11,775
-You're serious?
-Yeah! What do we have to lose?

343
00:19:15,904 --> 00:19:20,159
All I've really ever wanted was to know
what it feels like to be human.

344
00:19:20,242 --> 00:19:24,288
And now we're going to do
the most human thing of all.

345
00:19:24,371 --> 00:19:28,500
Attempt something futile
with a ton of unearned confidence

346
00:19:28,584 --> 00:19:31,086
and fail spectacularly!

347
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:34,089
Get up! Get up! Everyone!

348
00:19:35,132 --> 00:19:36,925
Get rest tonight.

349
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:41,722
First thing tomorrow,
we're going to the Bad Place.

350
00:19:42,806 --> 00:19:47,269
We had a lot of good times together.
I'll see you in the next life.

351
00:19:47,352 --> 00:19:48,604
Goodbye, clowns.

352
00:19:48,687 --> 00:19:53,108
Goodbye, modernist architecture
that I was too trashy to appreciate.

353
00:19:54,943 --> 00:19:57,821
-Goodbye, house.
-Goodbye, house.

354
00:20:03,076 --> 00:20:04,077
What up, idiot?

355
00:20:04,161 --> 00:20:07,664
This is the 8:22 express
to Bad Place Headquarters.

356
00:20:07,748 --> 00:20:11,335
We'd like to begin the boarding process
with our first-class fat dinks.

357
00:20:11,418 --> 00:20:13,629
And there is no overhead storage.

358
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:15,547
So if you have any bags,
why don't you just

359
00:20:15,631 --> 00:20:17,883
go ahead and place them up your fat butts?

360
00:20:17,966 --> 00:20:21,220
-Sorry about this, Bad Janet.
-Sorry about what, ya fat dink--

361
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:25,224
Oh. [grunts]

362
00:20:25,307 --> 00:20:26,725
[sighs]

363
00:20:27,434 --> 00:20:29,645
This was your life's work.

364
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:32,189
Are you okay with leaving
the fake Good Place behind?

365
00:20:32,272 --> 00:20:36,985
As long as I'm with you guys,
I'm always in the fake Good Place.

366
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:39,613
That doesn't sound as nice
as you think it does.

367
00:20:41,531 --> 00:20:46,954
{\an8}The real Bad Place was the friends
we made along the way.

368
00:20:47,037 --> 00:20:49,498
{\an8}Nope. Still nonsense. One more try.

369
00:20:50,415 --> 00:20:53,168
{\an8}In a way, the Good Place

370
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:58,215
{\an8}was inside the Bad Place all along?

371
00:20:58,298 --> 00:21:00,467
{\an8}That's technically true.
I'll give it to you.

372
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:01,635
{\an8}[laughs]

373
00:21:02,594 --> 00:21:04,763
{\an8}-I just made an aphorism.
-[chuckles]

374
00:21:05,806 --> 00:21:10,269
{\an8}Hit it, Janet. Next stop,
the actual Bad Place!

375
00:21:19,528 --> 00:21:21,446
[train chugging]
