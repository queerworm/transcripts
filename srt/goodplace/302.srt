1
00:00:02,419 --> 00:00:05,046
Michael, a demon
has infiltrated the group.

2
00:00:05,547 --> 00:00:07,090
Not just any demon.

3
00:00:07,674 --> 00:00:11,219
Trevor is a diabolical, sadistic
agent of evil.

4
00:00:11,302 --> 00:00:15,724
He might just be the single most
dangerous creature in the universe.

5
00:00:15,807 --> 00:00:18,810
Who wants lemon bars?

6
00:00:18,893 --> 00:00:22,230
It's my nana's recipe
and they are just sinful.

7
00:00:22,313 --> 00:00:23,982
Love 'em on my lips,
but hate 'em on my hips,

8
00:00:24,065 --> 00:00:25,734
-if you know what I mean.
-All right, new guy.

9
00:00:25,817 --> 00:00:27,402
Comin' in strong with free dessert.

10
00:00:27,485 --> 00:00:30,739
You must be Eleanor,
the reason this is all happening.

11
00:00:30,822 --> 00:00:33,658
I am. It's so nice to hear someone say,

12
00:00:33,742 --> 00:00:35,493
"Eleanor, you're the reason
this is all happening,"

13
00:00:35,577 --> 00:00:37,328
who isn't a judge in small claims court.

14
00:00:37,412 --> 00:00:41,624
Thank you for this, Eleanor.
It's a wonderful thing you've done.

15
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:42,834
[Eleanor] Mmm.

16
00:00:42,917 --> 00:00:43,918
Happy to help you out, buddy.

17
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:46,129
Oh! We're doing a long hug.

18
00:00:46,212 --> 00:00:48,006
-[sobbing]
-Are you crying?

19
00:00:48,089 --> 00:00:52,969
I'm sorry. I'm just so happy to be here,
if that makes sense. [sniffles]

20
00:00:53,052 --> 00:00:55,847
[Chidi] Okay, the five of us
narrowly avoided death.

21
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:59,100
The operating theory of this experiment
is that a second...

22
00:00:59,184 --> 00:01:01,186
[theme music playing]

23
00:01:05,774 --> 00:01:08,943
So, I give them ethics problems
and we scan their brains,

24
00:01:09,027 --> 00:01:11,446
{\an8}and we get a sense
of their baseline moral instincts.

25
00:01:11,529 --> 00:01:12,781
{\an8}Right. Then, I'll show them pictures

26
00:01:12,864 --> 00:01:14,908
{\an8}that trigger memories
of their near-death experiences.

27
00:01:14,991 --> 00:01:17,702
{\an8}We'll scan again
and see if we get a different result.

28
00:01:17,786 --> 00:01:19,746
{\an8}For example, I'll show Jason

29
00:01:19,829 --> 00:01:24,501
{\an8}pictures of a safe, a snorkel
and whip-it canisters.

30
00:01:24,584 --> 00:01:28,546
{\an8}Got it. Also, what a grim death
that would've been.

31
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:30,256
{\an8}Darling, do you remember all the rules

32
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:33,301
{\an8}about what can and cannot be worn
inside an MRI?

33
00:01:33,384 --> 00:01:37,472
{\an8}More specifically,
what if one's brassiere is very thin,

34
00:01:37,555 --> 00:01:40,141
{\an8}but also very pure gold?

35
00:01:40,225 --> 00:01:45,188
{\an8}I don't know, but I'm in a similar situash
because the sports bra I'm wearing

36
00:01:45,271 --> 00:01:48,066
{\an8}is kind of rust-colored
underneath the armpits,

37
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:50,568
{\an8}so I guess we'll roll the dice together.

38
00:01:50,652 --> 00:01:53,363
{\an8}Hey, Eleanor, do I have
the right phone number for you?

39
00:01:53,446 --> 00:01:56,407
{\an8}You haven't responded
to any of the dank memes I've sent.

40
00:01:56,491 --> 00:02:00,620
{\an8}Oh... Yeah, I...
'Cause I was laughing too hard to reply.

41
00:02:00,703 --> 00:02:03,581
{\an8}Okay, what's your fave?
'Cause mine's "Damn, Daniel--"

42
00:02:03,665 --> 00:02:06,084
{\an8}-"Back at it again with the white Vans!"
-[laughs]

43
00:02:06,668 --> 00:02:07,752
{\an8}Should we get started, maybe?

44
00:02:07,836 --> 00:02:09,003
{\an8}[Jason] Oh, Mrs. Teacher?

45
00:02:09,087 --> 00:02:13,675
{\an8}For my turn, is there any way to get,
like, extra radiation?

46
00:02:13,758 --> 00:02:16,511
{\an8}There is no radiation in an MRI,
but why do you ask?

47
00:02:16,594 --> 00:02:18,429
-Uh... No reason.
-[Eleanor] Jason.

48
00:02:19,097 --> 00:02:21,307
-What do you got in your hand there, bud?
-Nothing.

49
00:02:21,391 --> 00:02:22,559
Is it a spider?

50
00:02:23,726 --> 00:02:25,687
-Yes.
-Do you think taking a spider

51
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:28,106
in an MRI machine
will give you super powers?

52
00:02:28,189 --> 00:02:30,567
Hey, it might work.
He already bit me a bunch of times,

53
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:32,902
and gave me the power to swell up my hand.

54
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:33,820
[Tahani] Oh, my God!

55
00:02:33,903 --> 00:02:34,946
What?

56
00:02:37,866 --> 00:02:39,659
-Trevor.
-Hey, Mikey.

57
00:02:39,742 --> 00:02:43,413
Fancy seeing you down on Earth,
completely illegally.

58
00:02:43,496 --> 00:02:45,999
Sweet outfit. Dick Tracy called.

59
00:02:46,082 --> 00:02:48,918
He said you're a buttface
and he's been plowing your mom.

60
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:51,170
Yeah, well,
Dick Tracy called me too, first,

61
00:02:51,254 --> 00:02:53,548
and he said he was about to call you,

62
00:02:53,631 --> 00:02:57,802
and say a lie about me
that was actually true about you, instead.

63
00:02:58,887 --> 00:03:01,723
Whatever. What are you doing here, Trevor?

64
00:03:01,806 --> 00:03:04,434
Shawn hacked the Judge's system
and we caught you cheating,

65
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:06,728
getting your four little cockroaches
to meet up.

66
00:03:06,811 --> 00:03:09,397
What, you think we were just
going to sit around in the Bad Place

67
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:13,192
blowin' beefers while you're down on Earth
boning us in the meathole?

68
00:03:13,276 --> 00:03:16,279
So why didn't Shawn just go to the Judge
and turn me in?

69
00:03:16,362 --> 00:03:18,907
Because this way's more fun, knucklenuts.

70
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:23,995
First of all, I'm currently formulating
a better comeback to your Dick Tracy burn,

71
00:03:24,078 --> 00:03:25,663
and it's gonna devastate you.

72
00:03:25,747 --> 00:03:27,332
Second, you're too late,

73
00:03:27,415 --> 00:03:30,084
because when I did this experiment
in my neighborhood,

74
00:03:30,168 --> 00:03:32,503
every time Eleanor asked Chidi for help,

75
00:03:32,587 --> 00:03:36,799
their bond became unbreakable,
and the entire group improved.

76
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:41,179
No, you're right. There's no way
I'll get one of these bozos

77
00:03:41,262 --> 00:03:44,682
to drop out of an unpaid,
rigorous academic study,

78
00:03:44,766 --> 00:03:48,686
especially when they're doing it with me,
their over-eager new best friend.

79
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:51,022
Well, I should head back.
You want to come with?

80
00:03:51,105 --> 00:03:56,611
Oh, right, they've all seen you already,
so you can't show your face to them again,

81
00:03:56,694 --> 00:03:59,239
so you're powerless to stop me.

82
00:03:59,822 --> 00:04:01,324
Later days, dingus.

83
00:04:02,408 --> 00:04:07,622
Dick Tracy called back on his watch phone
and said you better watch out.

84
00:04:08,206 --> 00:04:09,958
[softly] Shoot. A second too late.

85
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:15,546
Okay, Simone's gotta analyze the scans,
so why don't the rest of you head home?

86
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:16,589
Good first day, everyone.

87
00:04:16,673 --> 00:04:22,637
Hey, teach, um,
do you think maybe we could continue

88
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,555
the one-on-one lessons on the side?

89
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:27,558
I feel like last week
I had my own personal ninja master,

90
00:04:27,642 --> 00:04:32,230
and now I'm taking tai chi
with a bunch of farting housewives.

91
00:04:33,523 --> 00:04:36,317
Between the new project and my classes,
I won't have time.

92
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:39,696
But this is way better.
You're still gonna learn a lot,

93
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:42,573
and you'll have a fun group of people
to study with outside of class.

94
00:04:43,157 --> 00:04:44,575
-But--
-[Trevor] Hey, gang.

95
00:04:44,659 --> 00:04:47,954
I just had a neat idea.
Let's all go sightseeing.

96
00:04:48,037 --> 00:04:49,080
-Dope!
-[Trevor] Yeah.

97
00:04:49,163 --> 00:04:52,792
We can check out Sydney,
get to know each other, bond.

98
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:54,294
What do you say, E Street Band?

99
00:04:54,377 --> 00:04:57,672
Ya up for a Segway tour of
[in Australian accent] Australia, mate?

100
00:04:57,755 --> 00:05:01,217
This is a knife on the barbie. [chuckles]

101
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:05,513
Cool idea. I'm just worried
that maybe... it's too cool?

102
00:05:05,596 --> 00:05:07,598
I think I'm just gonna find
the nearest bar,

103
00:05:07,682 --> 00:05:09,600
have one or eight drinks and hit the hay.

104
00:05:09,684 --> 00:05:12,979
Even better. We'll all go bend an elbow.

105
00:05:13,062 --> 00:05:16,899
[normal] Actually, I know
the perfect place for homesick Americans.

106
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:23,156
{\an8}[in Southern accent] Hi, dudes.
Welcome to the Cowboy Skyscraper Buffet.

107
00:05:23,239 --> 00:05:27,660
Oh, hey, can we get the Florida table?
They absolutely nailed the swamp stench.

108
00:05:27,744 --> 00:05:29,954
[normal] Oh. Someone's seated there.

109
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:33,624
But if you purchase
our Manifest Destiny package for $30,

110
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:36,544
you can have anyone you want
forcibly removed from the table.

111
00:05:36,627 --> 00:05:37,795
We'll just sit anywhere.

112
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:40,506
[in Southern accent] When your
table's ready, this gun will go off.

113
00:05:42,383 --> 00:05:44,469
I think this is real.

114
00:05:48,765 --> 00:05:50,183
[Trevor] So, listen up, y'all.

115
00:05:50,266 --> 00:05:55,813
I was so excited to join the group
that I made sweatshirts.

116
00:05:55,897 --> 00:05:59,150
You get a sweatshirt.
You get a sweatshirt.

117
00:05:59,233 --> 00:06:00,610
-You get a sweatshirt.
-I get a sweatshirt.

118
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:01,944
"The Brain-y Bunch."

119
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:04,030
[Jason] Awesome! I love being on teams.

120
00:06:04,113 --> 00:06:06,199
And if we're on a team now,
we need nicknames.

121
00:06:06,282 --> 00:06:09,994
Optimus, Bumblebee, Jazz... Uh, Megatron.

122
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:13,122
That's what you can each call me.
Now we need nicknames for you guys.

123
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:15,083
Oh, this is the best!

124
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:18,127
I'm gonna get the first round,
and we are all gonna toast to Eleanor,

125
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:21,047
the reason we're all here! Yay, Eleanor!

126
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:22,298
-Eleanor!
-[all cheering]

127
00:06:22,381 --> 00:06:25,343
Well, if you guys are celebrating,
I recommend the jalapeño poppers.

128
00:06:25,426 --> 00:06:28,679
Hi, there. I'm Janet.
I'll be taking care of you tonight.

129
00:06:31,474 --> 00:06:33,351
Can I get you started with some drinks?

130
00:06:33,434 --> 00:06:36,604
Our specialty cocktail tonight
is the 4th of July.

131
00:06:36,687 --> 00:06:37,980
It's half an apple pie,

132
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:40,358
blended with Southern Comfort
and Coca-Cola,

133
00:06:40,441 --> 00:06:42,193
served in a Chevy hubcap. [chuckles]

134
00:06:42,276 --> 00:06:44,695
Why don't you just go get us
a round of beers?

135
00:06:44,779 --> 00:06:46,197
Of course. Here you go.

136
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:48,825
[chuckles] Sorry.

137
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:53,746
I will go physically pick those up,
I guess,

138
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:58,000
and then walk them back here
with my feet. [chuckles]

139
00:06:58,584 --> 00:07:00,336
But just so you know,
I will be here all night,

140
00:07:00,419 --> 00:07:05,716
watching everything that you order.

141
00:07:07,677 --> 00:07:11,722
So, Ellie baby, brainstorm.
We should get a house.

142
00:07:11,806 --> 00:07:16,644
Me, you, Tahani, Jason.
We should all go in together on a place.

143
00:07:16,727 --> 00:07:18,479
-Roomies!
-Roomies!

144
00:07:18,563 --> 00:07:22,608
That is... technically, an idea.

145
00:07:22,692 --> 00:07:25,403
I think it would be supes fun.
We could play pranks on each other...

146
00:07:25,486 --> 00:07:26,320
-No.
-...for my vlog.

147
00:07:26,404 --> 00:07:28,489
We could do one of those ice bucket
challenges that...

148
00:07:28,573 --> 00:07:29,407
-I don't think so.
-...I sent you.

149
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:33,453
Or maybe just a Harlem Shake?
I like to cook and I have been...

150
00:07:33,536 --> 00:07:34,495
-Please, stop.
-...dying to experiment with...

151
00:07:34,579 --> 00:07:35,663
-Please stop now.
-...Jamaican food, man.

152
00:07:36,247 --> 00:07:37,582
[in Jamaican accent]
I like the Jamaican food.

153
00:07:37,665 --> 00:07:40,126
Listen to the reggae and smoke da joints.

154
00:07:40,209 --> 00:07:41,502
[normal] That's a Jamaican accent.

155
00:07:44,255 --> 00:07:46,841
Come on, come on, come on!

156
00:07:46,924 --> 00:07:49,093
-[softly] Hey, how's it going?
-Not good, Michael.

157
00:07:49,177 --> 00:07:51,637
I don't have my powers.
I can't summon things.

158
00:07:51,721 --> 00:07:55,808
Dictionary. Spaghetti.
Jet Ski. Giraffe. Gah!

159
00:07:55,892 --> 00:07:58,686
Look what I've been reduced to.
Humans only live 80 years,

160
00:07:58,769 --> 00:08:02,064
and they spend so much of it
just waiting for things to be over.

161
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:03,816
I'm all out of sorts down here, too.

162
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:06,861
I'm bad at lying now.
That used to be my thing.

163
00:08:06,944 --> 00:08:10,072
And every part of my body
is either too dry or too wet.

164
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:11,532
It's worse for me, man.

165
00:08:11,616 --> 00:08:15,745
Ever since we walked through that portal,
my knowledge has stopped updating.

166
00:08:15,828 --> 00:08:17,705
The instant before we left,

167
00:08:17,788 --> 00:08:20,416
a man in Caracas, Venezuela,
named Raul Benitez

168
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:23,878
was eating a ham sandwich.
Did he finish it?

169
00:08:23,961 --> 00:08:26,672
I don't know and it's making me crazy.
I gotta find him.

170
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:29,509
Janet, focus on the mission.

171
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:32,136
We have to get Trevor
away from the humans.

172
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:33,262
Okay.

173
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:37,475
I am so glad you came out with us, man.

174
00:08:37,558 --> 00:08:40,394
I just assumed you would think
it's unprofessional to be friends

175
00:08:40,478 --> 00:08:41,646
with the subjects of your study.

176
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:43,231
No, I never thought that.

177
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:48,361
I mean, I kind of do now.
Should I not be socializing?

178
00:08:48,444 --> 00:08:51,155
I'm sure it's fine. I mean,
how much harm could it possibly do?

179
00:08:51,239 --> 00:08:52,240
Good point.

180
00:08:53,991 --> 00:08:57,203
Such a good point that I'm gonna go
think about how good a point that is,

181
00:08:57,286 --> 00:09:00,081
over there, by myself,
for several minutes. Excuse me.

182
00:09:01,415 --> 00:09:04,835
Hey, El-Train, you think
with all these new Star Wars movies,

183
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:06,379
they'll finally make a new <i>Spaceballs?</i>

184
00:09:06,462 --> 00:09:09,006
I'm sorry, I'm getting a text
and I have to take this.

185
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:15,263
Okay, everybody, here are your beers,
and here is yours...

186
00:09:15,346 --> 00:09:17,431
Oh, no! Oh!

187
00:09:18,015 --> 00:09:21,644
I guess you should go to the bathroom
or maybe go home and never come back.

188
00:09:21,727 --> 00:09:23,229
No worries, I made extra sweatshirts.

189
00:09:23,312 --> 00:09:25,690
Besides, we're having
too much fun to leave.

190
00:09:25,773 --> 00:09:29,610
Hey, speaking of fun, I know this
super-fun drinking game we could play.

191
00:09:29,694 --> 00:09:31,862
Every time one of you says something

192
00:09:31,946 --> 00:09:35,324
that the other can't relate to,
you both drink.

193
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:37,451
Could be fun.
I once played a drinking game

194
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:40,454
with Ryan Reynolds and Blake Lively
at their macrobiotic farm

195
00:09:40,538 --> 00:09:44,500
with a particularly robust batch
of homemade kombucha.

196
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:47,253
Do I have to drink
for every word I don't know?

197
00:09:47,336 --> 00:09:49,088
Up to you. Just drink.

198
00:09:49,672 --> 00:09:53,009
Hey. What happened with Chidi?
And where's Eleanor?

199
00:09:53,092 --> 00:09:55,219
This is all moving too fast!

200
00:09:55,303 --> 00:09:56,929
Can we just take Trevor out?

201
00:09:57,013 --> 00:09:59,515
I don't know if he can die, but I could
drop a steamroller on his head.

202
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:01,767
Aw, darn it. I can't summon things.

203
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:06,147
I guess I could kick him
with my soft feet? Earth sucks.

204
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:09,233
You stay on Trevor,
keep interfering with his plan, all right?

205
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:13,070
I'm gonna do my librarian act
and nudge Chidi back to the table.

206
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:15,990
-[Trevor] Ah...
-[Tahani] Yay!

207
00:10:16,073 --> 00:10:17,158
Yummy!

208
00:10:17,241 --> 00:10:19,785
You gotta relax, man.
You're off the clock.

209
00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:23,247
It's just a simple drink with friends
at the world's worst restaurant.

210
00:10:23,331 --> 00:10:24,915
No, but Trevor's right.

211
00:10:24,999 --> 00:10:28,210
I might skew the study
by fraternizing with the subjects.

212
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:31,297
We can be colleagues.
Associates is pushing it.

213
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:35,051
And by even having this conversation,
you're becoming my confidant.

214
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:36,677
I can't have that.

215
00:10:36,761 --> 00:10:40,514
Geez, I kinda thought
that before everyone else showed up,

216
00:10:40,598 --> 00:10:44,310
you and I were becoming actual friends.

217
00:10:44,977 --> 00:10:47,146
Oh, no! You're right. What have I done?

218
00:10:47,229 --> 00:10:51,108
Okay, okay. I'm gonna go to the bar
and get you a hot tea.

219
00:10:51,192 --> 00:10:53,277
-Okay.
-Or a regular-temperature Xanax.

220
00:10:53,361 --> 00:10:55,488
-Mmm.
-Try not to fall apart.

221
00:10:57,698 --> 00:10:59,241
[in Australian accent] Professor Anagonye?

222
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:03,621
Oh, yeah, I thought I recognized you.
It's me, the librarian, from the library.

223
00:11:03,704 --> 00:11:09,085
Oh! Right. Hi. Sorry. Uh... I was just
in the middle of something here.

224
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:10,711
Well, maybe I can help.

225
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:13,464
You know what I like to do
in situations like these?

226
00:11:14,298 --> 00:11:16,550
I haven't told you anything
about what I'm going through.

227
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,429
Do that first.
Then, I'll tell you what I do

228
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:23,099
in situations such as the one
you're about to describe.

229
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:26,477
I've been in every situation
because I'm a librarian.

230
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:27,812
Hit me. Go ahead.

231
00:11:27,895 --> 00:11:28,813
Mmm.

232
00:11:28,896 --> 00:11:31,607
Ah... [laughs]

233
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:32,858
I'm tired.

234
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:35,319
Does anybody want a gallon of water
to sober up?

235
00:11:35,403 --> 00:11:38,364
[Trevor] No, thanks, sweetheart. I just
called a car for these two love birds,

236
00:11:38,447 --> 00:11:40,282
so why don't you just bring us the check?

237
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:44,412
Oh, and you should smile more.
You'll get bigger tips.

238
00:11:46,122 --> 00:11:47,123
Gosh, you're pretty.

239
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:51,335
No, you're pretty. Pretty beautiful.

240
00:11:52,795 --> 00:11:55,631
If you ask me, Chidi,
you need to get back over there,

241
00:11:55,714 --> 00:11:57,466
you know, spend time with the team.

242
00:11:57,550 --> 00:12:00,970
Though we do have a saying
in the library game, um...

243
00:12:01,053 --> 00:12:04,723
"There's only room for one male subject
in an academic study,

244
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:07,476
so keep the one who got there first."

245
00:12:08,436 --> 00:12:10,229
-Catchy.
-Gotta go now.

246
00:12:10,813 --> 00:12:12,022
The closest thing
I could find to herbal tea

247
00:12:12,106 --> 00:12:14,900
was a root beer
I had them throw in the microwave.

248
00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:16,610
You know what? Don't drink that.

249
00:12:17,153 --> 00:12:18,404
I think I'm just gonna head home.

250
00:12:18,487 --> 00:12:20,197
But you can go
and spend time with the others.

251
00:12:20,281 --> 00:12:23,242
Yeah, man,
that's not really what I signed up for.

252
00:12:23,325 --> 00:12:24,577
I mean, Tahani is eh.

253
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:25,828
But Jason, woof.

254
00:12:26,454 --> 00:12:27,830
And Trevor, blech.

255
00:12:27,913 --> 00:12:32,585
They're not the reason
I flew all the way from Arizona. You are.

256
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:37,339
I'm sorry,
but this is just how it has to be.

257
00:12:37,923 --> 00:12:39,633
[stammers] I'll see you tomorrow.

258
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:45,014
Hey, E-Dog, get over here.
It's trivia night.

259
00:12:45,097 --> 00:12:47,558
First-round questions
are all about Logan Paul.

260
00:12:47,641 --> 00:12:49,560
And you know I'm Lo-gang for life.

261
00:12:50,394 --> 00:12:51,645
[softly] Go put your head
up your own butt.

262
00:12:51,729 --> 00:12:52,771
-What?
-What?

263
00:12:52,855 --> 00:12:53,689
What?

264
00:12:56,108 --> 00:12:57,651
[laughing]

265
00:12:57,735 --> 00:12:58,569
Oh.

266
00:12:58,652 --> 00:13:00,863
Don't you buttnecks ever give up?

267
00:13:00,946 --> 00:13:03,365
No, and what are you
even doing in a bathroom?

268
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:05,743
You're a demon, you don't... need it.

269
00:13:05,826 --> 00:13:08,829
I like the smells,
and I like putting my hands in the toilet,

270
00:13:08,913 --> 00:13:11,415
so everything I touch
gets a little bit of poop on it.

271
00:13:11,499 --> 00:13:13,542
Hey, you guys see what I did out there?

272
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:17,880
I am so good,
I got Eleanor to leave a bar early.

273
00:13:17,963 --> 00:13:21,217
Chidi's melting down.
Jason and Tahani just left together.

274
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:24,011
If they hook up, she's on
the first private jet out of here.

275
00:13:24,094 --> 00:13:25,262
This was too easy.

276
00:13:25,346 --> 00:13:27,806
It's gonna take a lot more than that
to break up this group.

277
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:30,100
Why don't you give up, Trevor?

278
00:13:30,184 --> 00:13:33,062
As long as we're here,
you'll never succeed.

279
00:13:33,145 --> 00:13:34,939
Maybe, but how long will that take?

280
00:13:35,022 --> 00:13:37,066
I mean, at some point,
the Judge will find out

281
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:39,818
that you're not in your little room
watching ticker tape. Right?

282
00:13:39,902 --> 00:13:40,986
Tick, tick, tick, tick.

283
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:43,697
But, hey, may the worst demon win.

284
00:13:43,781 --> 00:13:45,157
Good luck, Mikey.

285
00:13:46,825 --> 00:13:50,412
Ah! Poop hands! I can't believe
you fell for that. [laughs]

286
00:13:54,792 --> 00:13:56,877
Are you all right?
You didn't sleep at all last night.

287
00:13:56,961 --> 00:14:02,049
Yeah, I got a solid eight minutes.
Not consecutively, but still, it's fine.

288
00:14:02,132 --> 00:14:03,634
You're not even that blurry.

289
00:14:03,717 --> 00:14:04,885
You gotta take it easy, man.

290
00:14:04,969 --> 00:14:07,346
I mean, you're not sleeping.
Your eye is twitching.

291
00:14:07,429 --> 00:14:09,640
This study has to be airtight,

292
00:14:09,723 --> 00:14:14,812
and this ethical question of friendship
with the subjects is weighing on me.

293
00:14:14,895 --> 00:14:16,230
I've done a million of these things.

294
00:14:16,313 --> 00:14:18,482
I promise I'll warn you
if you cross any lines.

295
00:14:18,566 --> 00:14:21,777
I don't want to come
anywhere near those lines.

296
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:25,865
I have been waiting my entire career
for the right thesis

297
00:14:25,948 --> 00:14:28,284
and I am not going to blow it.

298
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:30,160
I have to keep this professional.

299
00:14:30,244 --> 00:14:32,246
Fine, but you need to get some rest.

300
00:14:32,329 --> 00:14:34,206
This morning, you bit into a raw egg
like it was an apple.

301
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:36,375
I thought it was hard-boiled.

302
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:38,294
Yeah, but still, the shell.

303
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:41,797
This is the best
secret-friend handshake, bro.

304
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:42,715
And it goes...

305
00:14:42,798 --> 00:14:45,301
Attention, everyone. Do not look at me.

306
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:47,887
[chuckles] Oh. I don't know what to do.

307
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:53,559
I am both overhung and humiliated
by my uncouth comportment last night.

308
00:14:53,642 --> 00:14:56,186
Please accept
these formal letters of apology.

309
00:14:56,770 --> 00:14:58,522
Further apologies for their appearance.

310
00:14:58,606 --> 00:15:01,400
I just couldn't find a proper calligrapher
at 5:00 in the morning.

311
00:15:01,483 --> 00:15:04,111
So, what happened
to you two love birds last night, huh?

312
00:15:04,194 --> 00:15:06,447
-Frankly, it is none of your business.
-Oh. Sorry.

313
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:09,533
But Jason was a perfect gentleman
last night.

314
00:15:09,617 --> 00:15:12,703
Thank you so much
for getting me home safely.

315
00:15:12,786 --> 00:15:16,999
I wouldn't blame you should you
ostracize me for my boorish behavior.

316
00:15:17,082 --> 00:15:18,751
You weren't boring.
You were fun.

317
00:15:19,335 --> 00:15:22,838
Crazy story. After you got into the cab,
I forgot where I lived,

318
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:25,841
but then I looked across the street
and there was a motel.

319
00:15:26,342 --> 00:15:28,135
And behind that, there was a dumpster.

320
00:15:28,218 --> 00:15:29,511
I slept in a dumpster.

321
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:31,055
Jason.

322
00:15:31,138 --> 00:15:34,892
No, no, no, it was fine.
And it was super fun getting to know you.

323
00:15:34,975 --> 00:15:37,227
You're the fanciest person I know,

324
00:15:37,311 --> 00:15:38,979
next to my friend Ronnie,
who drives a limo.

325
00:15:39,063 --> 00:15:42,441
He's in limos all the time.
Aw. What a life.

326
00:15:43,025 --> 00:15:45,986
Right. As soon as Eleanor gets here,
we'll begin.

327
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:48,405
Bad news, prof.
Eleanor might not be coming.

328
00:15:48,489 --> 00:15:50,449
She bailed right after you did last night.

329
00:15:50,532 --> 00:15:52,451
Seemed like she was having second thoughts

330
00:15:52,534 --> 00:15:54,578
about being a part
of the Brain-y Bunch, so...

331
00:15:54,662 --> 00:15:56,288
Oh, well, that's disappointing...

332
00:15:56,372 --> 00:15:59,083
[stammers] in terms of
how it affects the study.

333
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:02,711
But we press on, like professionals.

334
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:05,923
[sighs]

335
00:16:09,718 --> 00:16:11,303
-Hey, do you think I should--
-Yeah.

336
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:14,515
And I already called you a car because
you should not drive. It's outside.

337
00:16:14,598 --> 00:16:15,891
Thanks.

338
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:21,105
Where's outside?

339
00:16:25,401 --> 00:16:26,360
{\an8}[knock on door]

340
00:16:28,445 --> 00:16:29,446
Hey, man.

341
00:16:32,908 --> 00:16:35,160
-Are you okay?
-Sorry.

342
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:40,374
Uh, literally one second ago,
I was at the front desk.

343
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:45,087
Don't know where I got this. [laughs]
Anyway, are you coming to class?

344
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:46,046
Eh...

345
00:16:47,172 --> 00:16:49,216
I don't think the group thing is for me.

346
00:16:49,299 --> 00:16:52,845
I'm better when it's one-on-one,
and we're both looking at our phones,

347
00:16:52,928 --> 00:16:55,639
and I don't know the other person,
and we don't talk.

348
00:16:55,723 --> 00:16:58,100
I might just head back to Arizona.

349
00:16:58,183 --> 00:16:59,268
[sighs]

350
00:16:59,351 --> 00:17:00,352
Listen.

351
00:17:01,395 --> 00:17:05,899
My whole life has been
a torture chamber of indecision.

352
00:17:05,983 --> 00:17:09,361
And now, I'm finally on the path
to understanding why,

353
00:17:09,445 --> 00:17:12,698
and the only reason that's happening
is because you walked into my office,

354
00:17:12,781 --> 00:17:15,075
and you said
you wanted to be a better person.

355
00:17:15,159 --> 00:17:16,493
That was really brave.

356
00:17:16,577 --> 00:17:19,038
Now, I know we barely know each other,

357
00:17:19,121 --> 00:17:21,457
but, please,
could you give me three months?

358
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:25,961
Can you give me three months?
I am asking you as a friend.

359
00:17:27,254 --> 00:17:29,089
See, I just told you I don't like talking.

360
00:17:29,173 --> 00:17:32,885
That whole thing could've been sent
in a text that I pretended I never saw.

361
00:17:33,427 --> 00:17:34,428
[sighs]

362
00:17:35,137 --> 00:17:38,557
Fine. You did good at talking.
I'll come back to class.

363
00:17:40,768 --> 00:17:43,103
Come in! No?

364
00:17:43,187 --> 00:17:45,105
-I'm gonna drive you back.
-Okay.

365
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:49,777
Hey, Dick Tracy called.

366
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:54,198
He said that I was right about Eleanor
and Chidi having an unbreakable bond.

367
00:17:54,281 --> 00:17:56,158
I don't think you understand
how that joke works.

368
00:17:56,241 --> 00:17:59,161
Yeah, that doesn't matter.
We won. That's the point.

369
00:17:59,244 --> 00:18:02,164
You won squat.
We're gonna get 'em eventually.

370
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:05,042
I'll just keep chipping away
till one of them bails.

371
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:08,253
These four humans
are all I care about in the universe.

372
00:18:08,337 --> 00:18:12,257
And there is nothing, and I mean nothing,
that's gonna come between me--

373
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:18,764
Oh. Cool. You're all together.
The Judge wants to see you.

374
00:18:19,473 --> 00:18:21,225
Now? Right now?

375
00:18:21,308 --> 00:18:23,602
-Um... Like, all of us, or--
-Yup.

376
00:18:25,354 --> 00:18:26,605
So, this is Earth, huh?

377
00:18:29,566 --> 00:18:30,567
Whoo.

378
00:18:30,651 --> 00:18:31,944
Pretty cool.

379
00:18:42,162 --> 00:18:45,624
Michael, how many times did I say
you could go down to Earth?

380
00:18:45,707 --> 00:18:47,876
Actually, you weren't 100% explicit--

381
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:50,671
One time. I said you could go down there,

382
00:18:50,754 --> 00:18:55,843
save their lives, start the new timeline
and then come back here to observe them.

383
00:18:55,926 --> 00:18:59,596
"One time," is what I said. <i>Uno.</i>

384
00:19:00,848 --> 00:19:02,307
One!

385
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:06,645
Your Honor, I have to say,
I support you one-hundo percent.

386
00:19:06,728 --> 00:19:09,690
I mean, what Michael did is unbelievable.

387
00:19:09,773 --> 00:19:13,110
Now, granted, I also tricked the doorman
and snuck down to Earth,

388
00:19:13,193 --> 00:19:14,111
but what are we gonna do--

389
00:19:14,194 --> 00:19:15,487
[grunts] Ahh!

390
00:19:16,071 --> 00:19:20,534
Do you realize what you did?
You meddled in human affairs.

391
00:19:20,617 --> 00:19:22,995
That ripples out, man!

392
00:19:23,078 --> 00:19:25,164
Do you know
how much weird stuff has happened

393
00:19:25,247 --> 00:19:26,832
because of your little experiment?

394
00:19:26,915 --> 00:19:28,125
England left Europe.

395
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:31,420
That Hugh Jackman musical
about P.T. Barnum?

396
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:33,463
It made, like, $400 million.

397
00:19:33,547 --> 00:19:37,342
Also, the Jacksonville Jaguars
are good now.

398
00:19:37,426 --> 00:19:38,635
Impossible.

399
00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:40,846
I'm serious!
They're gonna make the playoffs.

400
00:19:40,929 --> 00:19:44,391
Blake Bortles is kind of okay, maybe?

401
00:19:44,474 --> 00:19:48,187
I don't know. It's being debated
amongst experts. It's confusing.

402
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:53,150
But whatever it is, it's yo' fault.
Your experiment with the humans is over.

403
00:19:53,233 --> 00:19:55,235
-Are you gonna kill them?
-No!

404
00:19:55,986 --> 00:19:59,156
But starting now,
there is no more monitoring them.

405
00:19:59,239 --> 00:20:02,951
They're just regular humans that
need to hit the regular point threshold

406
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:04,453
to see if they make it
into the Good Place.

407
00:20:04,536 --> 00:20:05,913
{\an8}-Hmm.
-And if they don't...

408
00:20:14,004 --> 00:20:17,049
{\an8}And right now, the two of you
are going back to the Bad Place.

409
00:20:17,132 --> 00:20:20,302
{\an8}But they'll retire Michael.
And I'll be marbleized.

410
00:20:20,385 --> 00:20:22,930
{\an8}Well, maybe, you should have
thought about that

411
00:20:23,013 --> 00:20:26,141
{\an8}before you intervened in human affairs!

412
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:30,187
{\an8}I mean, because of you,
Byron Allen owns the Weather Channel now.

413
00:20:30,979 --> 00:20:32,231
{\an8}Is that bad?

414
00:20:32,314 --> 00:20:34,608
{\an8}I don't know, but it's weird, man!

415
00:20:34,691 --> 00:20:35,859
Now, come with me.

416
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:39,112
Hey. My powers are back online.

417
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:42,491
This must be everything
I tried to summon on Earth.

418
00:20:43,867 --> 00:20:46,578
-Stop it.
-I don't think I can. I'm like a printer,

419
00:20:46,662 --> 00:20:49,915
when the print queue suddenly starts
processing all the unprinted documents.

420
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:53,210
Oh, man. Buckle up, folks.

421
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:00,300
[whispering] Let's go. Right now.

422
00:21:00,384 --> 00:21:02,970
Janet, make it stop!

423
00:21:04,012 --> 00:21:07,057
Janet, stop it!
Janet, this is annoying.

424
00:21:08,141 --> 00:21:09,059
Janet!

425
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:12,729
Good luck, frog man. Pullin' for ya.

426
00:21:13,438 --> 00:21:14,773
[Judge] Janet, I know you're still there!

427
00:21:15,357 --> 00:21:16,233
[grunting]

428
00:21:22,489 --> 00:21:23,365
They escaped.

429
00:21:23,448 --> 00:21:25,701
Yeah. Thanks, Jeff.
