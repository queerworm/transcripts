1
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:03,920
Good afternoon, Eleanor.
What can I get you today?

2
00:00:04,963 --> 00:00:07,340
[Eleanor] Whoa! Lot of new flavors.

3
00:00:07,424 --> 00:00:08,466
Michael felt bad about the sinkhole,

4
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:10,343
so he wanted to give you all
a little treat.

5
00:00:10,427 --> 00:00:13,346
I recommend "Full Cell Phone Battery."

6
00:00:14,764 --> 00:00:15,765
Whoa!

7
00:00:16,266 --> 00:00:20,020
It somehow tastes how I felt
when my cell phone was fully charged.

8
00:00:20,103 --> 00:00:21,146
Oh, I'm so relaxed.

9
00:00:22,021 --> 00:00:24,399
But they all look good.
This might take me a while.

10
00:00:25,066 --> 00:00:27,152
You know what, Gunnar,
why don't you go ahead?

11
00:00:27,235 --> 00:00:28,611
-Thanks so much, Eleanor.
-Mmm-hmm.

12
00:00:28,695 --> 00:00:30,321
[Janet] What can I get you, Gunnar?
[Gunnar] Hi, Janet.

13
00:00:30,405 --> 00:00:33,199
-Can I have some Folded Laundry?
-[Janet] Coming up.

14
00:00:37,787 --> 00:00:39,122
[panting]

15
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:43,752
Chidi!

16
00:00:43,835 --> 00:00:45,003
You'll never believe it.

17
00:00:45,086 --> 00:00:47,464
I was at the frozen yogurt place
and I didn't know what I wanted,

18
00:00:47,547 --> 00:00:49,215
so I turned to the guy behind me,
and I was like,

19
00:00:49,299 --> 00:00:51,050
"Why don't you go ahead?" [gasps]

20
00:00:51,134 --> 00:00:53,344
Just like that! "Why don't you go ahead?"

21
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:56,681
-[stammers] Okay...
-Dude, you don't understand!

22
00:00:56,765 --> 00:00:58,975
I never did stuff like that
when I was on Earth.

23
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:00,977
But now, thanks to your
"good person" lessons,

24
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:02,479
I didn't hold up the line.

25
00:01:02,562 --> 00:01:04,981
I didn't even try a dozen samples
I didn't want

26
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:07,567
just to spite some jerk who told me
I was holding up the line.

27
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:11,529
-You do that?
-No, Chidi, I used to do that.

28
00:01:11,613 --> 00:01:14,657
Now I do selfless things
without even thinking about it.

29
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:17,660
-That's great. I'm... I'm proud of you.
-[sighs]

30
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:20,622
-So where's our yogurt?
-[groans] I forgot it.

31
00:01:20,705 --> 00:01:24,417
[groans] Oh... Can you go?
I don't want to go all the way back.

32
00:01:24,501 --> 00:01:27,754
I ran all the way here and it was so hot.

33
00:01:28,588 --> 00:01:32,634
I mean, I will happily get it,
because I told you I would.

34
00:01:35,845 --> 00:01:36,930
Good person.

35
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:47,982
{\an8}So, to sum up, Utilitarianism posits
that the correct choice

36
00:01:48,066 --> 00:01:50,819
{\an8}is the one that causes
the most good or pleasure,

37
00:01:50,902 --> 00:01:53,029
{\an8}and the least pain and suffering.

38
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:55,657
{\an8}I like this one. It's simple.

39
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:58,451
{\an8}Ugh... Screw all the other
complicated theories,

40
00:01:58,535 --> 00:02:01,121
{\an8}-why didn't you start with this one?
-Ah, but here's the problem.

41
00:02:01,204 --> 00:02:04,040
{\an8}If all that matters
is the sum total of "goodness,"

42
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:06,292
{\an8}then you can justify
any number of bad actions,

43
00:02:06,376 --> 00:02:09,504
{\an8}like torturing one innocent person
to save a hundred,

44
00:02:09,587 --> 00:02:10,797
{\an8}or preemptive war...

45
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,215
{\an8}Oh, dude, I get it.

46
00:02:12,298 --> 00:02:14,342
{\an8}It's like, I knew this girl Sheila...

47
00:02:14,425 --> 00:02:17,303
{\an8}She was a black market alligator dealer
with a pierced jawbone.

48
00:02:17,387 --> 00:02:19,973
{\an8}Um... Okay, what?

49
00:02:20,056 --> 00:02:22,767
{\an8}Sheila was gonna get married
to my boy, Donkey Doug

50
00:02:22,851 --> 00:02:24,769
{\an8}and make him move to Sarasota.

51
00:02:24,853 --> 00:02:26,938
{\an8}It would've broken up
my whole break dancing crew

52
00:02:27,021 --> 00:02:29,149
{\an8}and Donkey Doug
was our best pop-and-locker.

53
00:02:29,232 --> 00:02:33,653
{\an8}So I hid a bunch of stolen boogie boards
in Sheila's garage and called the cops.

54
00:02:33,736 --> 00:02:39,159
{\an8}I framed one innocent gator dealer
to save a 60-person dance crew.

55
00:02:39,242 --> 00:02:44,122
{\an8}Shockingly, that is a relevant example
of the Utilitarian dilemma. Well done.

56
00:02:44,205 --> 00:02:46,082
Thanks! Um...

57
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:49,836
{\an8}-Uh, yes, Jianyu?
-Can I be excused?

58
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:52,005
{\an8}Tahani's doing a brunch party
and I want to get there

59
00:02:52,088 --> 00:02:53,631
before all the mini-waffles run out.

60
00:02:53,715 --> 00:02:55,592
-Go ahead, man.
-Yes!

61
00:02:57,468 --> 00:03:00,430
[sighs] So, you want to roll
right into another lesson?

62
00:03:00,513 --> 00:03:03,558
I am revved up to learn, man.
My brain is horny!

63
00:03:03,641 --> 00:03:05,059
Um... Can we take a little break?

64
00:03:05,143 --> 00:03:06,978
I've been standing
at this chalkboard all day.

65
00:03:07,061 --> 00:03:08,062
Oh, yeah, I get it.

66
00:03:08,146 --> 00:03:11,482
Oh, you could, um, grade my paper
I wrote on the concept of dharma.

67
00:03:11,566 --> 00:03:14,694
Six pages, and I didn't even do that thing

68
00:03:14,777 --> 00:03:17,113
where I try to make it longer
by starting every sentence with

69
00:03:17,196 --> 00:03:18,323
"Interestingly..."

70
00:03:18,406 --> 00:03:20,700
Sure, I'll do that and, uh...

71
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:22,452
We can start another lesson.

72
00:03:26,414 --> 00:03:28,666
-[indistinct chatter]
-[Michael] Ah! Tahani.

73
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:31,794
I've been working on my Western Hemisphere
brunch banter.

74
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:33,087
Tell me what you think.

75
00:03:33,671 --> 00:03:35,840
That <i>New Yorker</i> article was crazy.

76
00:03:35,924 --> 00:03:37,884
You haven't seen <i>Hamilton?</i>

77
00:03:37,967 --> 00:03:39,802
Hey, did you hear about Stephanie?

78
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:42,347
-Very well done, Michael.
-Hi, there!

79
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:45,767
We have a Category 55
Emergency Doomsday Crisis.

80
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:51,147
-A Category 55 Emergency Doomsday Crisis?
-Mmm-hmm.

81
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:54,442
Sorry, what is a Category 55
Emergency Doomsday Crisis?

82
00:03:54,525 --> 00:03:57,153
It's nothing,
it's a tiny little inconvenience.

83
00:03:57,237 --> 00:04:00,281
Tahani, dear, could you show us
to a private room

84
00:04:00,365 --> 00:04:04,494
where no one can see or hear us,
even if I yell very loudly out of fear?

85
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:09,749
[gasps]

86
00:04:09,832 --> 00:04:12,460
[Janet] It appears that the sinkhole
is not repairing itself.

87
00:04:12,543 --> 00:04:14,545
This is very bad, Janet.

88
00:04:14,629 --> 00:04:17,340
We have to go into the sinkhole
and fix it by hand.

89
00:04:17,423 --> 00:04:18,549
Get the tools.

90
00:04:18,633 --> 00:04:22,053
-Sorry, can I be of any service?
-Ah! Tahani.

91
00:04:22,136 --> 00:04:24,013
Didn't see you there. Uh, no, no.

92
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:28,393
We're just having a slight problem
with the enormous sinkhole.

93
00:04:28,476 --> 00:04:32,146
Yes, I meant to tell you...
I walked past it last night and I...

94
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:33,439
I actually saw it get a little bit bigger.

95
00:04:33,523 --> 00:04:36,109
[gasps and exclaims] It got bigger?

96
00:04:36,192 --> 00:04:38,903
[stammers] Ah, well,
that's so normal. Uh...

97
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:43,032
This is the reaction I have when things
are incredibly mundane and expected.

98
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:49,247
I'm gonna leave now at my regular pace,
as I do in most scenarios.

99
00:04:56,212 --> 00:04:58,673
Finally! Let's get back to it.

100
00:04:59,549 --> 00:05:02,760
Whip out that chalkboard, big boy,
show me what you're working with.

101
00:05:02,844 --> 00:05:06,055
Actually, I was going to head into town
and pick up some...

102
00:05:06,723 --> 00:05:08,766
-Blankets.
-Great, I'll grab my sweater.

103
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:11,227
I can practice
letting people cut in front of me.

104
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:13,104
You know, uh, I just realized

105
00:05:13,187 --> 00:05:16,357
that I have blankets,
so I'm going to take a nap

106
00:05:16,441 --> 00:05:19,319
using the several blankets
that I already have. Good night.

107
00:05:20,236 --> 00:05:23,614
Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh. What's wrong? Out with it.

108
00:05:23,698 --> 00:05:26,034
Fine, I'm just tired, need a break.
No big deal.

109
00:05:26,117 --> 00:05:27,785
The way you're talking to me right now?

110
00:05:27,869 --> 00:05:30,580
"Everything's cool, no big deal,"
I know that move.

111
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:33,583
When I told a boyfriend
something was "no big deal,"

112
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:36,586
it meant anything from "I just
bought weed from your nephew,"

113
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:39,130
to "I secretly befriended
your ex-girlfriend last year,

114
00:05:39,213 --> 00:05:41,382
"things got out of hand,
and now I'm her bridesmaid."

115
00:05:41,466 --> 00:05:42,633
Wow.

116
00:05:42,717 --> 00:05:45,470
Okay, well, in this case,
it really is no big deal.

117
00:05:45,553 --> 00:05:47,221
Dude, you're hiding something!

118
00:05:47,305 --> 00:05:50,141
-What's wrong?
-Nothing!

119
00:05:50,808 --> 00:05:55,396
What is wrong?

120
00:05:57,690 --> 00:05:58,691
[twitters]

121
00:06:03,988 --> 00:06:06,074
Jianyu, 2nd.

122
00:06:06,157 --> 00:06:09,202
Oh, well done, my love. [sniffles]

123
00:06:09,285 --> 00:06:10,620
So where am I?

124
00:06:11,287 --> 00:06:13,956
Eleanor, 6th? Come on. [scoffs]

125
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:26,594
Oh, no. I'm second to last.

126
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:29,514
Mummy, I made you this.

127
00:06:29,597 --> 00:06:31,974
It's the pretty bird we saw in the garden.

128
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:35,103
Thank you, Tahani. It's very competent.

129
00:06:36,312 --> 00:06:37,647
I made a bird, as well.

130
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:41,234
I worked in a reflective alloy,
holding up a mirror to mankind

131
00:06:41,317 --> 00:06:43,861
and its mistreatment
of these defenseless animals.

132
00:06:43,945 --> 00:06:45,738
Excellent, Kamilah.

133
00:06:45,822 --> 00:06:49,408
I sense the influence
of Brancusi and Kapoor.

134
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:51,244
It seems you're moving out
of your structural period,

135
00:06:51,327 --> 00:06:53,329
and more into conceptual abstraction.

136
00:06:53,412 --> 00:06:54,413
Good eye, Mother.

137
00:06:54,497 --> 00:06:58,042
I grew tired of objective representation.
I trust my audience.

138
00:06:59,168 --> 00:07:02,338
-My birdie has a hat.
-Yes, well done, Tahani.

139
00:07:04,006 --> 00:07:05,424
-[Eleanor repeatedly] What's wrong?
-[Chidi] Nothing's wrong.

140
00:07:05,508 --> 00:07:06,801
-What's wrong?
-Nothing's wrong.

141
00:07:06,884 --> 00:07:08,344
-What's wrong? What's wrong?
-Nothing's wrong. Nothing's wrong?

142
00:07:08,427 --> 00:07:09,887
-Would you stop doing that?
-What's wrong? What's wrong?

143
00:07:09,971 --> 00:07:11,180
-Okay, fine!
-What's wrong?

144
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:13,891
You want to know what's wrong?
You are a full-time job.

145
00:07:13,975 --> 00:07:15,393
I wake up, there's Eleanor.

146
00:07:15,476 --> 00:07:17,687
I spend all day teaching Eleanor.

147
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:19,439
And then it's, "Good night, Eleanor."

148
00:07:19,522 --> 00:07:21,774
Oh, this is a nice dream,
my grandma's here.

149
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:25,069
Wait, she's got Eleanor's face!
And tentacles for some reason.

150
00:07:25,153 --> 00:07:29,615
I thought you liked teaching me.
So now I'm just some huge burden for you?

151
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:32,952
Yes! Of course you are! I am in paradise!

152
00:07:33,035 --> 00:07:34,787
I should be doing paradise things,

153
00:07:34,871 --> 00:07:37,373
like rowing out on a lake
with a good bottle of wine,

154
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:38,541
reading French poetry.

155
00:07:38,624 --> 00:07:40,751
That's your idea of paradise?

156
00:07:40,835 --> 00:07:43,296
You know, and I can't stop helping you,

157
00:07:43,379 --> 00:07:45,631
because then I am shirking
my ethical duty.

158
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:47,592
It's an impossible position!

159
00:07:47,675 --> 00:07:50,303
You know what, if you're so stressed
from writing on a chalkboard,

160
00:07:50,386 --> 00:07:51,429
why don't you just leave?

161
00:07:51,512 --> 00:07:53,264
We can pretend to be soul mates in public,

162
00:07:53,347 --> 00:07:55,099
but other than that,
we don't have to see each other!

163
00:07:55,183 --> 00:07:57,268
-Fine with me! I'll move out right now.
-Fine!

164
00:07:57,351 --> 00:07:58,394
[alarm blaring]

165
00:07:58,478 --> 00:07:59,687
[Michael over speakers] <i>Good afternoon.</i>

166
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:04,066
<i>As you all may remember, a sinkhole</i>
<i>recently opened up in the town center.</i>

167
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:06,777
<i>The situation, sadly, has worsened.</i>

168
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:09,280
<i>Starting right now, no one may go outside</i>

169
00:08:09,363 --> 00:08:11,199
<i>under any circumstances.</i>

170
00:08:11,282 --> 00:08:15,203
<i>Leaving your homes could result </i>
<i>in catastrophic damage,</i>

171
00:08:15,286 --> 00:08:18,039
<i>to you and to the very fabric</i>
<i>of the universe.</i>

172
00:08:18,122 --> 00:08:20,333
<i>Okay, bye.</i>

173
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:22,627
-Or we could both just stay here.
-[sighs]

174
00:08:24,962 --> 00:08:28,633
[Michael over speakers] <i>We hope you enjoy</i>
<i>your eternal stay in The Good Place.</i>

175
00:08:28,716 --> 00:08:31,177
<i>Take advantage of our day spa,</i>

176
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:35,473
<i>or Janet... A magical assistant</i>
<i>who can get you whatever you want.</i>

177
00:08:35,556 --> 00:08:38,768
You mind turning that off?
It's been playing on a loop for two days.

178
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:43,314
The whole Neighborhood is offline.
We only get the welcome channel.

179
00:08:43,397 --> 00:08:48,361
I would love to not watch TV,
but you canceled school.

180
00:08:48,444 --> 00:08:51,239
[gasps] What have you done to me,
you monster?

181
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:54,700
Look at all these dishes piling up.

182
00:08:54,784 --> 00:08:56,369
I used to just throw them in the sink,

183
00:08:56,452 --> 00:08:58,704
and they'd be magically cleaned
by morning.

184
00:08:58,788 --> 00:09:00,373
I did that. I cleaned the dishes.

185
00:09:00,456 --> 00:09:01,541
Oh.

186
00:09:01,707 --> 00:09:03,125
Then what's up with these bad boys?

187
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:06,254
You are unbelievable.

188
00:09:06,337 --> 00:09:08,339
Are you still upset?
You're not over it yet?

189
00:09:08,422 --> 00:09:12,009
How can I be over it? We haven't discussed
it or even spoken for days.

190
00:09:12,093 --> 00:09:14,262
Well, it sounds like
you've had a really nice "vacation"

191
00:09:14,345 --> 00:09:15,930
from your "full-time job."

192
00:09:16,013 --> 00:09:17,848
Get your story straight, bro!

193
00:09:17,932 --> 00:09:19,642
-[banging on door]
-[Michael] Hey, guys, it's Michael.

194
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:20,768
[Eleanor groans]

195
00:09:21,477 --> 00:09:24,230
Hi, Michael, what a lovely surprise.

196
00:09:24,313 --> 00:09:26,774
Oh, I'd love to make small talk.
I've been practicing, too.

197
00:09:26,857 --> 00:09:29,360
I'm amazing at it,
but I'm in a bit of a rush here.

198
00:09:29,443 --> 00:09:30,987
This is Bart and Nina.

199
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:33,739
They live right next door
to the, uh, sinkhole,

200
00:09:33,823 --> 00:09:36,200
so they obviously need a place to stay.

201
00:09:36,284 --> 00:09:39,203
I was wondering, as my assistant,
maybe you could put them up for a while?

202
00:09:39,287 --> 00:09:42,123
Oh, of course. Don't think twice.

203
00:09:42,206 --> 00:09:46,502
Okay, shouldn't take long.
Between an hour and, um, 11 months.

204
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:48,629
Somewhere in there. Okay, bye.

205
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:51,549
Don't go outside.

206
00:09:53,342 --> 00:09:55,344
[all chuckle]

207
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:03,811
Hello, everyone, and welcome to day three
of our brunch siege.

208
00:10:03,894 --> 00:10:07,773
I stayed up all night
to plan a full day of fun activities.

209
00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:09,567
Just check the schedule I made.

210
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:12,361
Tahani, you are truly the best.

211
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:15,615
Yes, you would think so,
wouldn't you, Henriette?

212
00:10:18,909 --> 00:10:20,578
Still second to last.

213
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:22,496
[sighs]

214
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:23,706
[indistinct chatter]

215
00:10:26,542 --> 00:10:27,585
Tahani!

216
00:10:28,336 --> 00:10:30,963
This auction threatens to be
an embarrassing failure.

217
00:10:31,714 --> 00:10:34,008
5.2 million isn't bad.

218
00:10:34,091 --> 00:10:36,177
It's very "middle-thermometer."

219
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:40,640
Your public failure is our public failure.

220
00:10:40,723 --> 00:10:42,308
You know what has to be done.

221
00:10:43,351 --> 00:10:47,438
I'm very pleased to announce that there
has been an addition to today's docket.

222
00:10:48,939 --> 00:10:53,569
-I'm sure you all know my sister, Kamilah.
-[all cheering and applauding]

223
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:56,656
[chuckles] Yes. Kamilah.

224
00:10:56,739 --> 00:10:58,866
Kamilah, of course,
is the youngest person ever

225
00:10:58,949 --> 00:11:00,701
to graduate from Oxford University.

226
00:11:00,785 --> 00:11:04,622
She's a world-class painter,
social activist, iconoclast,

227
00:11:04,705 --> 00:11:07,541
Olympic gold medalist for archery,

228
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:13,631
a BAFTA Award-winner for her documentary
on her Grammy Award-winning album,

229
00:11:13,714 --> 00:11:17,635
and the person voted
"Most Likely to be Banksy."

230
00:11:17,718 --> 00:11:22,139
[laughs] So without further ado,
take it away from me!

231
00:11:22,223 --> 00:11:24,600
Sorry, I mean take it away, Kamilah.

232
00:11:24,683 --> 00:11:25,935
[all applauding]

233
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:30,940
I am auctioning off a lunch date with me.

234
00:11:31,732 --> 00:11:35,111
The bidding shall commence at £3,000,000.

235
00:11:36,654 --> 00:11:38,155
Five million!

236
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:44,036
[inhales sharply]

237
00:11:45,621 --> 00:11:47,748
[Nina] Thank you guys so much.

238
00:11:47,832 --> 00:11:50,668
-Sorry for the imposition.
-Oh... Bah!

239
00:11:50,751 --> 00:11:52,253
Oh, well, if you want to know the truth,

240
00:11:52,336 --> 00:11:54,004
we asked Michael
if we could stay with you.

241
00:11:54,088 --> 00:11:56,507
We are obsessed with your relationship.

242
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:59,176
Always whispering,
locking yourself in the house all day.

243
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:02,221
I thought I was an expert in true love
'cause of my old job.

244
00:12:02,304 --> 00:12:04,807
[chuckles] But I have
a lot to learn from you guys.

245
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:06,392
Your job? What was your job?

246
00:12:06,475 --> 00:12:07,643
I was a marriage counselor.

247
00:12:07,726 --> 00:12:11,272
You could say I wrote the book
on healthy relationships.

248
00:12:11,355 --> 00:12:13,107
-And I did! [laughs]
-[laughs]

249
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:17,653
It's called, <i>How to Spot Problems </i>
<i>in a Marriage From a 100 Miles Away.</i>

250
00:12:17,736 --> 00:12:19,113
[both] Oh, cool.

251
00:12:19,196 --> 00:12:20,364
-Really cool.
-Cool.

252
00:12:20,448 --> 00:12:21,949
-Really, really cool.
-Cool, cool.

253
00:12:22,032 --> 00:12:23,117
And what about you, Bart?

254
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,619
Oh, well, my job wasn't
nearly as interesting.

255
00:12:25,703 --> 00:12:28,038
I started a company
that investigated identity theft.

256
00:12:28,122 --> 00:12:30,541
Analyzing body language,
tracking and catching people

257
00:12:30,624 --> 00:12:31,834
pretending to be someone they're not.

258
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:34,253
[scoffs] It's snooze, am I right?

259
00:12:34,336 --> 00:12:36,380
[Bart and Nina chuckle]

260
00:12:36,505 --> 00:12:40,050
They're gonna catch us!
This is an extremely precarious situation!

261
00:12:40,134 --> 00:12:41,469
I am vexed, Eleanor!

262
00:12:41,552 --> 00:12:43,721
A marriage counselor
and a human lie detector

263
00:12:43,804 --> 00:12:46,140
isn't my first choice for company, either.

264
00:12:46,223 --> 00:12:48,058
But they have no reason to suspect us!

265
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:54,857
Plus, I think they may have actually
just come here to, you know, swing.

266
00:12:55,858 --> 00:12:57,234
I say we do it.

267
00:12:57,318 --> 00:12:58,777
It'll get 'em to stop asking questions.

268
00:12:58,861 --> 00:13:01,280
No, I... I am not going to have
sex with someone

269
00:13:01,363 --> 00:13:03,157
to get them to stop talking to me!

270
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:05,367
Really? You and I are very different.

271
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:08,120
-Yeah, I noticed!
-You know what, man?

272
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:09,997
I have spent every second in this place

273
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:12,500
worried I was gonna get caught,
but if we go down right now,

274
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:14,126
that's on you, okay?

275
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:17,463
Oh, you spend all your time
teaching a charming, awesome lady?

276
00:13:17,546 --> 00:13:20,007
How sad for you. Face it, dude.

277
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:23,719
I'm the best thing that ever happened
to you. Because guess what, Chidi?

278
00:13:23,802 --> 00:13:26,472
-Ya basic!
-[sighs] Eleanor...

279
00:13:26,555 --> 00:13:28,182
Yeah, I know, you want to do that thing

280
00:13:28,265 --> 00:13:30,559
where we're arguing and fighting,
but then suddenly it's like,

281
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:32,728
"Whoa! This is hot,"
and we start making out.

282
00:13:32,811 --> 00:13:35,064
Dream on!
Or, whatever, fine, let's just do it.

283
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:36,815
No, Eleanor, look.

284
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:45,533
So how much of that did you hear?

285
00:13:45,616 --> 00:13:47,368
We couldn't hear you, but I'm an expert

286
00:13:47,451 --> 00:13:49,411
in non-verbal communication,
and it is clear...

287
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:50,621
You are in conflict.

288
00:13:50,704 --> 00:13:53,958
We're not judging you.
This has been a tough couple of weeks.

289
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:58,504
I'm sure the stress of the sinkhole
has caused lots of soul mate squabbles.

290
00:13:58,587 --> 00:14:01,632
Yes, that's what it is. A squabble.

291
00:14:01,715 --> 00:14:03,092
-We're squabbling.
-Squabble, squabble!

292
00:14:03,175 --> 00:14:04,426
[Nina] I can help.

293
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:07,846
I'm gonna take your relationship
and put it under a microscope

294
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:10,849
and dig and poke and prod

295
00:14:10,933 --> 00:14:13,936
until you are back to soul mate harmony.

296
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:15,271
Eleanor, why don't you--

297
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:17,856
She never does the dishes.
I have to do them all the time.

298
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:20,776
-We just have different interests.
-[Nina] Mmm-hmm.

299
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:24,572
I like relaxing, he likes
getting on my case about the dishes.

300
00:14:24,655 --> 00:14:26,407
I'm getting a lot of repressed anger.

301
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:28,993
I suspected this when I arrived,
but now I'm sure.

302
00:14:29,076 --> 00:14:33,205
-You are hiding something.
-What on Earth would I be--

303
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:34,957
No, no, no, not you.

304
00:14:35,624 --> 00:14:36,750
Him.

305
00:14:39,128 --> 00:14:43,048
[over speakers] <i>Please go back inside.</i>
<i>It isn't safe to be out of your home.</i>

306
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:45,009
<i>Please go back inside.</i>

307
00:14:45,092 --> 00:14:47,386
Janet, could you see what's wrong?

308
00:14:47,469 --> 00:14:49,930
-Everything.
-Oh... [groans]

309
00:14:51,765 --> 00:14:54,226
My goodness!
It's even worse than I thought.

310
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:55,686
Tahani, what're you doing here?

311
00:14:55,769 --> 00:14:59,189
Well, everyone else might be okay staying
inside, but I wanted to help.

312
00:14:59,273 --> 00:15:02,818
So I've brought some cheer
and sustenance to raise your spirits.

313
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:04,153
Look, I made donut holes.

314
00:15:04,236 --> 00:15:06,822
Do you get it? "Donut holes"?

315
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:09,491
Sinkhole. Funny, no?

316
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:12,202
No, too soon. By exactly nine days.

317
00:15:12,286 --> 00:15:15,289
Tahani, this sinkhole
is incredibly dangerous.

318
00:15:15,372 --> 00:15:19,001
If a human gets too close to it,
there could be disastrous side effects.

319
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:23,923
-What's... What's happening to me?
-Oh, that's one of the side effects.

320
00:15:24,006 --> 00:15:26,342
Janet, knock her out
while we still have time.

321
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:27,635
Knock me out? What does that--

322
00:15:27,718 --> 00:15:29,929
-Boop!
-[thuds]

323
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:34,934
Guys, really, it's no big deal.

324
00:15:35,017 --> 00:15:37,853
"It's not a big deal"
is nearly always code

325
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:39,730
for "something is wrong."

326
00:15:39,813 --> 00:15:43,108
Boom! That's what I said.
I should've been a marriage counselor.

327
00:15:43,192 --> 00:15:45,319
Okay, Chidi, out with it.

328
00:15:45,402 --> 00:15:48,697
What is so unsatisfying
about your soul mate relationship?

329
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:50,115
Be honest, Chidi.

330
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:54,662
Be, like, the exact right amount of honest

331
00:15:54,745 --> 00:15:57,247
so that we can both be happy.

332
00:15:58,666 --> 00:16:01,961
I never had a soul mate on Earth.

333
00:16:02,044 --> 00:16:07,257
I never even really had
a girlfriend that I loved.

334
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:09,760
And when I got here,
and Michael said I would

335
00:16:09,843 --> 00:16:13,639
finally meet my actual soul mate,
I was so excited.

336
00:16:13,722 --> 00:16:15,015
And it isn't...

337
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:19,812
Exactly what I thought.

338
00:16:20,562 --> 00:16:23,440
You've never had
an intense relationship before.

339
00:16:23,524 --> 00:16:25,651
This is all uncharted territory.

340
00:16:25,734 --> 00:16:28,487
No wonder you're so tense. [chuckles]

341
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:32,408
You know, Nina and I are skilled
in the art of massage.

342
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:35,119
-Uh, not erotic massage.
-Mmm.

343
00:16:35,202 --> 00:16:37,329
Although, it can be,
and it often leads there, anyway...

344
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:39,373
Okay, well, you know what?

345
00:16:39,456 --> 00:16:41,625
You guys have given us
so much to think about.

346
00:16:41,709 --> 00:16:45,212
And I think we should go to bed.
Just the two of us, alone. Just us.

347
00:16:45,295 --> 00:16:47,548
[whispers] I know it's not
the right time, but I told you.

348
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:51,343
Tahani, wake up, dear.

349
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:52,803
Michael.

350
00:16:54,263 --> 00:16:55,681
Did it work?

351
00:16:55,764 --> 00:16:58,392
Did I fix the sinkhole? Am I a heroine?

352
00:16:58,475 --> 00:17:01,520
No, you did something
catastrophically stupid

353
00:17:01,603 --> 00:17:02,938
and we had to knock you unconscious.

354
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:05,774
Why in the world did you go outside?

355
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:08,694
Because I saw the rankings in the manual.

356
00:17:08,777 --> 00:17:12,448
That manual is only meant to be seen
by Architects and Janets.

357
00:17:12,531 --> 00:17:15,034
It's got some very sensitive material.

358
00:17:15,117 --> 00:17:17,619
Plus some song lyrics
I've been working on,

359
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:20,664
and I'd rather not let people see those
until they're finished.

360
00:17:20,748 --> 00:17:25,502
But, anyway, why did seeing
the rankings unravel you so?

361
00:17:28,213 --> 00:17:31,592
I was so sorry to hear
of your parents' passing.

362
00:17:31,675 --> 00:17:34,928
Please bear with me as I share
their last will and testament.

363
00:17:35,012 --> 00:17:37,723
"To Kamilah, we have left £68,000,000,

364
00:17:37,806 --> 00:17:42,811
the home in Kensington, the yacht,
and other assorted weekend boats."

365
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:46,190
Well, what did they leave
their second favorite child?

366
00:17:46,273 --> 00:17:50,069
There's still quite a lot of, uh, money
and property that goes to you.

367
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:52,154
There is one issue, however.

368
00:17:52,237 --> 00:17:55,449
They have, um, spelled your name
incorrectly in the will.

369
00:17:55,532 --> 00:17:56,867
You've got to be kidding me.

370
00:17:56,950 --> 00:18:00,537
It says, "We bequeath
the rest of our estate to Tahini."

371
00:18:00,621 --> 00:18:01,872
Like the sauce.

372
00:18:01,955 --> 00:18:05,084
You know what? I don't want the money.

373
00:18:05,167 --> 00:18:07,711
My sister can have it all.

374
00:18:07,795 --> 00:18:11,048
My whole life,
I have lived in your shadow,

375
00:18:11,131 --> 00:18:13,509
but now I'm going to step out of it.

376
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:17,054
I am going to reach
heights of success and sophistication

377
00:18:17,137 --> 00:18:18,472
that you can only dream of.

378
00:18:18,555 --> 00:18:20,224
Your cardigan's on inside out.

379
00:18:20,307 --> 00:18:24,770
I know!
It's a new trend that I am starting.

380
00:18:24,853 --> 00:18:27,815
Just one example of how I'm going to
step out of your shadow.

381
00:18:29,066 --> 00:18:30,067
[sighs]

382
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:33,070
Oh, I'm sorry that I looked
at the rankings, Michael.

383
00:18:33,153 --> 00:18:36,323
But I just don't understand
how I'm so low.

384
00:18:36,406 --> 00:18:39,701
My entire life, I have tried
to be extraordinary,

385
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:41,120
but it just never seemed to be enough.

386
00:18:41,203 --> 00:18:42,538
Ah...

387
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:44,915
And you thought you could
increase your ranking

388
00:18:44,998 --> 00:18:47,376
by helping us fix the sinkhole.

389
00:18:48,418 --> 00:18:53,132
Tahani, the point evaluations
stop the moment you die.

390
00:18:53,215 --> 00:18:56,760
But also, out of literally billions,

391
00:18:56,844 --> 00:19:00,973
you were one of the most
remarkable people on Earth.

392
00:19:01,056 --> 00:19:04,768
You have nothing left to prove, to anyone.

393
00:19:04,852 --> 00:19:07,062
-[beeping]
-Hi, there.

394
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:08,981
The sinkhole has begun to repair itself.

395
00:19:09,064 --> 00:19:10,524
-[Tahani gasps]
-It has?

396
00:19:10,607 --> 00:19:12,693
-Could it be... Did I?
-But how...

397
00:19:12,776 --> 00:19:14,695
-"Tahani saves the--"
-No, no, no.

398
00:19:14,778 --> 00:19:16,864
Still not you.
You have nothing to do with it.

399
00:19:16,947 --> 00:19:18,699
We've got to leave immediately.

400
00:19:18,782 --> 00:19:20,951
[Michael over speakers]
<i>It's now safe to go outside.</i>

401
00:19:22,369 --> 00:19:24,163
<i>It's now safe to go outside.</i>

402
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:27,791
<i>It's now safe to go outside.</i>

403
00:19:29,585 --> 00:19:32,254
-Morning, teach!
-Mornin'.

404
00:19:32,337 --> 00:19:34,006
What's this about?

405
00:19:34,089 --> 00:19:35,716
Well, here's what I realized.

406
00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:38,177
It's not just that helping me
is a full-time job

407
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:39,511
that you feel you have to do.

408
00:19:40,721 --> 00:19:43,182
The real problem is,
that the more you help me,

409
00:19:43,265 --> 00:19:45,767
the greater the chance is
that I can stay here,

410
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:49,938
and me staying here means
you'll never get a real soul mate.

411
00:19:50,939 --> 00:19:54,401
-I'm basically a Utilitarian nightmare.
-[chuckles]

412
00:19:54,484 --> 00:19:57,237
Every ounce of my happiness
leads to a ton of pain for you.

413
00:19:57,321 --> 00:20:03,160
So... Every time the simple fact
of my existence starts to bum you out,

414
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:06,955
{\an8}I want you to hold this up.

415
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:10,459
{\an8}-[chuckles]
-At which point, I will leave you alone

416
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:11,752
{\an8}for as long as you need.

417
00:20:11,835 --> 00:20:15,422
I know we'll never be soul mates,
but we're friends.

418
00:20:16,965 --> 00:20:19,885
Now get in this boat and read
some boring French poetry.

419
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:27,976
[chuckles]

420
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:32,731
I've never actually done this before.

421
00:20:32,814 --> 00:20:34,566
This is a theoretical fantasy.

422
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:37,110
How do you row a boat?

423
00:20:37,194 --> 00:20:40,572
I'll tell ya, it's good as new. Go ahead,
if you want, just... Here. [whoops]

424
00:20:40,656 --> 00:20:42,449
See? You can jump up and down on it.

425
00:20:42,532 --> 00:20:44,743
Hey, boss. So you fixed the sinkhole.

426
00:20:44,826 --> 00:20:47,079
{\an8}Yup, good as new. Crisis averted.

427
00:20:47,162 --> 00:20:51,041
{\an8}Everybody have a wonderful day,
because I fixed the sinkhole.

428
00:20:51,124 --> 00:20:53,627
{\an8}-I didn't fix the sinkhole.
-Sorry?

429
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:57,339
{\an8}I tried and I tried, but nothing worked.
And then all of a sudden...

430
00:20:57,422 --> 00:20:59,341
{\an8}This morning, out of the blue,
it just... [exclaims]

431
00:20:59,424 --> 00:21:01,176
{\an8}It just closed over.

432
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:05,514
{\an8}Huh... How 'bout that?

433
00:21:05,597 --> 00:21:09,434
{\an8}Well, as your assistant,
I officially declare this good news.

434
00:21:09,518 --> 00:21:14,231
{\an8}No, this is terrible news!
I have no idea what caused it, Eleanor.

435
00:21:14,314 --> 00:21:16,316
{\an8}And no idea what fixed it.

436
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:19,820
I want you to come to my office
first thing in the morning.

437
00:21:19,903 --> 00:21:23,615
You and I are gonna find this problem.
