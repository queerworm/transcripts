00:00:03,086 --> 00:00:06,798
-You, Eleanor Shellstrop, are dead.
-Cool.

2
00:00:06,881 --> 00:00:09,634
Eleanor, you are my soulmate.

3
00:00:09,718 --> 00:00:12,011
There's been a big mistake.

4
00:00:12,429 --> 00:00:14,514
I'm not supposed to be here.

5
00:00:14,597 --> 00:00:17,892
-Wait, what?
-These people might be good,

6
00:00:17,976 --> 00:00:20,061
<i>but are they really</i>
<i>that much better than me?</i>

7
00:00:20,145 --> 00:00:21,187
[thunder cracks]

8
00:00:23,231 --> 00:00:26,317
[Chidi] <i>Eleanor!</i>
<i>This is all happening because of you!</i>

9
00:00:26,401 --> 00:00:29,112
Give me a chance.
Let me earn my place here.

10
00:00:29,195 --> 00:00:31,114
Let me be your ethical guinea pig.

11
00:00:31,197 --> 00:00:33,742
My soul is in your hands, soulmate.

12
00:00:36,244 --> 00:00:39,789
[stammers] I don't know what to do here.
This is a mess.

13
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:44,711
Morally speaking, this is a putrid,
disgusting bowl of ethical soup.

14
00:00:44,836 --> 00:00:47,255
Okay, well, how about we just chill

15
00:00:47,338 --> 00:00:51,301
and go to the town meeting
and talk it out after?

16
00:00:51,384 --> 00:00:54,804
Great. Hey, how do I make
that helper woman show up?

17
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:59,017
Hello? Front desk lady?
Magical slave robot?

18
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:00,935
-Excuse me, Janet?
-Hi, there.

19
00:01:01,019 --> 00:01:04,439
[gasps] Still not used to it.
Um, Janet, I need...

20
00:01:05,273 --> 00:01:08,610
Quick question,
can anyone access our search history,

21
00:01:08,693 --> 00:01:11,613
or is this an incognito browsing situation

22
00:01:11,696 --> 00:01:14,324
like when you're stalking a hot mailman
from your work computer?

23
00:01:14,407 --> 00:01:15,784
It is 100% confidential.

24
00:01:15,867 --> 00:01:18,995
No one can access what you ask me,
including Michael.

25
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:21,081
Now, what kind of pornography
would you like to see?

26
00:01:21,164 --> 00:01:22,791
No. No, no, no, not porn.

27
00:01:22,874 --> 00:01:27,212
I, um... I need clothes,
like yours and Chidi's with the stripes.

28
00:01:27,295 --> 00:01:28,671
-[chimes]
-There you go.

29
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:30,757
[indistinct chatter]

30
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,300
[Michael] Everybody, everybody!

31
00:01:32,383 --> 00:01:34,677
Gather round, please,
thank you, thank you.

32
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:37,972
Obviously, there's something very wrong
with this neighborhood.

33
00:01:38,056 --> 00:01:41,392
We don't know what it is,
how long it will last,

34
00:01:41,476 --> 00:01:42,811
or what caused it.

35
00:01:42,894 --> 00:01:44,354
What do we know, Janet?

36
00:01:44,437 --> 00:01:46,314
We know where it happened.

37
00:01:46,397 --> 00:01:48,066
-Here.
-Yes, thank you, Janet.

38
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:49,526
The chaos happened here.

39
00:01:50,026 --> 00:01:52,362
See, that's the trouble
with these perfect systems.

40
00:01:52,445 --> 00:01:54,197
One little flaw can lead to...

41
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,825
Well, it can lead to...

42
00:01:56,908 --> 00:01:59,244
-Gary over there.
-[crowd murmuring]

43
00:01:59,327 --> 00:02:01,788
Hey, Gary. Hang in there, buddy.

44
00:02:03,081 --> 00:02:05,625
Boy, my armpits are leaking.
What is that called again?

45
00:02:05,708 --> 00:02:07,168
-Sweat.
-Right, right.

46
00:02:07,252 --> 00:02:08,878
Still not used to being in a human body.
[chuckles]

47
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:11,256
And what do you do with sweat?
Do you lick it away, is that right?

48
00:02:11,339 --> 00:02:14,843
-No, you dab it with a cloth.
-Oh, right.

49
00:02:15,677 --> 00:02:18,930
And then you lick the cloth?
That seems weirder.

50
00:02:20,014 --> 00:02:24,310
-[gasps] Michael. Look!
-Okay. That's a good sign.

51
00:02:24,394 --> 00:02:26,521
[stammers] It could mean
that this is almost over.

52
00:02:26,604 --> 00:02:28,731
Oh, such a relief.

53
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:30,733
That was my first time
as a fashion "don't,"

54
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:32,360
and I did not care for it.

55
00:02:35,029 --> 00:02:37,031
{\an8}[theme music playing]

56
00:02:40,118 --> 00:02:43,121
[Eleanor] Okay,
things are settling down outside.

57
00:02:43,204 --> 00:02:45,582
{\an8}I think it's time to...

58
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:49,127
{\an8}make me good, partner. How do we do it?

59
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:52,255
{\an8}Is there a pill I can take
or something I could vape?

60
00:02:52,338 --> 00:02:53,840
{\an8}Where did you get a chalkboard?

61
00:02:53,923 --> 00:02:57,176
{\an8}It's The Good Place,
you can get anything you want at any time.

62
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:58,595
{\an8}And you chose a chalkboard?

63
00:02:58,678 --> 00:03:00,305
What are you reading?

64
00:03:00,972 --> 00:03:03,600
{\an8}<i>The Metaphysics of Morals</i>
by Immanuel Kant.

65
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:05,685
{\an8}It's a treatise
on the aesthetic preconditions

66
00:03:05,768 --> 00:03:07,520
{\an8}of the mind's receptivity to duty.

67
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:10,189
{\an8}It's a book on how to act good.

68
00:03:10,273 --> 00:03:12,775
{\an8}Oh, great! So you've decided to help me?

69
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:15,612
{\an8}I don't know.
There's a thousand questions.

70
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:18,781
{\an8}-Is there a moral imperative to help you?
-Hmm.

71
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:20,742
{\an8}Do I have a greater obligation
to my community?

72
00:03:20,825 --> 00:03:24,245
{\an8}Are you taking someone else's spot,
someone who deserves to be here?

73
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:28,958
{\an8}Ooh! On that question, I honestly think
I was just put here by mistake.

74
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:31,502
{\an8}Because Michael called me
Eleanor Shellstrop,

75
00:03:31,586 --> 00:03:33,338
{\an8}so he knows I'm me.

76
00:03:33,421 --> 00:03:37,342
{\an8}He's just wrong about
my overall "quality" level.

77
00:03:37,425 --> 00:03:41,179
{\an8}Please, help me, man.
I swear I am worth it.

78
00:03:41,262 --> 00:03:44,015
{\an8}Tell me one fact that you know about me.

79
00:03:44,682 --> 00:03:47,477
{\an8}I mean, we spent the whole day together.
You must remember something.

{\an8}[clicks tongue]

81
00:03:48,686 --> 00:03:49,979
{\an8}What country am I from?

82
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:52,857
{\an8}[sighs] Is it racist if I say Africa?

83
00:03:52,941 --> 00:03:56,653
Yes, and Africa is not a country.
I am from Senegal.

84
00:03:56,736 --> 00:03:59,697
Do I have any siblings?
Where did I go to college?

85
00:03:59,781 --> 00:04:02,575
Trick question. You didn't.

86
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:05,536
I was literally a college professor.

87
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:08,248
Do you not remember
one single thing about me?

88
00:04:08,331 --> 00:04:10,625
Dude, things have been nuts around here.

89
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:12,877
I bet you don't know anything about me.

90
00:04:12,961 --> 00:04:14,921
You were born in Phoenix.
You went to school in Tempe.

91
00:04:15,004 --> 00:04:15,838
You're an only child.

92
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:18,591
Your favorite show is something called
<i>The Real Housewives of Atlanta,</i>

93
00:04:18,675 --> 00:04:23,096
and your favorite book
is Kendall Jenner's Instagram feed.

94
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:25,515
How did you know all that?

95
00:04:25,598 --> 00:04:29,811
Because you are constantly
talking about yourself.

96
00:04:29,894 --> 00:04:32,981
You are the most self-obsessed person
I have ever met.

97
00:04:33,064 --> 00:04:36,276
[laughs] You should see
Kendall Jenner's Instagram feed.

98
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:37,735
Okay, this is my fear about you, Eleanor.

99
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:40,905
You are too selfish
to ever be a good person.

100
00:04:40,989 --> 00:04:43,908
Well, I think you're wrong.
What country am I from, again?

101
00:04:43,992 --> 00:04:47,245
Sen...sodyne.

102
00:04:47,328 --> 00:04:48,746
That is a brand of toothpaste.

103
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:51,374
Look, the only thing
that you are concerned with

104
00:04:51,457 --> 00:04:53,167
is your own happiness.

105
00:04:54,168 --> 00:04:55,295
That's your problem.

106
00:04:58,423 --> 00:04:59,632
[scoffs]

107
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:03,970
Okay, names in the hat.
Time to pick a designated driver.

108
00:05:04,053 --> 00:05:05,847
And the loser is...

109
00:05:07,015 --> 00:05:08,016
Betsy.

110
00:05:08,099 --> 00:05:09,767
Wait, you never get picked,

111
00:05:09,851 --> 00:05:11,811
and you're always the one
who draws the name.

112
00:05:11,894 --> 00:05:13,438
-Let me see that.
-There's no need.

113
00:05:13,521 --> 00:05:16,441
Everyone here believes in
my integrity 100%, right, guys?

114
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,860
Give it to me.

115
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:20,987
For the record...

116
00:05:21,738 --> 00:05:24,699
I did that out of principle,
because it absolutely had your name on it.

117
00:05:24,782 --> 00:05:26,868
If I check the other ones,
I can figure it out

118
00:05:26,951 --> 00:05:28,536
by process of elimination.

119
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:36,461
Again, out of principle.
Let it wash over you, Betsy.

120
00:05:36,544 --> 00:05:38,671
This is what integrity looks like.

121
00:05:41,966 --> 00:05:43,551
[Michael] All right, everyone,
let's get started.

122
00:05:43,634 --> 00:05:46,429
Things have settled down. Phew! [chuckles]

123
00:05:46,512 --> 00:05:48,347
So hopefully, we're off and running.

124
00:05:48,431 --> 00:05:51,392
Welcome to orientation, day two.

125
00:05:51,476 --> 00:05:53,394
Now, today we're gonna
start with something

126
00:05:53,478 --> 00:05:55,938
that everyone has always wanted to do.

127
00:05:56,856 --> 00:05:59,567
-Flying.
-[crowd cheering and applauding]

128
00:06:00,318 --> 00:06:02,779
Now that you're dead,
let's live a little, right?

129
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:06,699
Uh, sorry. Uh, Michael? If... If I might?

130
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:10,912
I was just thinking,
earlier today in all of the chaos,

131
00:06:10,995 --> 00:06:13,331
large swaths of this neighborhood
were destroyed.

132
00:06:13,414 --> 00:06:17,210
We thought perhaps some of us could
volunteer to help clean up the debris.

133
00:06:17,293 --> 00:06:20,421
You know, it's quite a fun way
to band together as a community,

134
00:06:20,505 --> 00:06:21,714
isn't that right, Jianyu?

135
00:06:23,091 --> 00:06:25,134
Oh, uh, yeah, sorry.
For those of you who don't know,

136
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:27,303
my soulmate, Jianyu here,
is a Buddhist monk.

137
00:06:27,386 --> 00:06:30,473
He took a vow of silence
that he's still observing,

138
00:06:30,556 --> 00:06:32,767
even here, in The Good Place.

139
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:34,560
It's truly inspiring.

140
00:06:34,644 --> 00:06:37,563
Well, Tahani,
it's not really your job to clean up,

141
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:40,483
but I suppose there's no harm
if you really want to.

142
00:06:40,566 --> 00:06:44,237
Oh, well, hurrah.
We need about, uh, 12 volunteers.

143
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,404
Oh!

144
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:48,282
I can't believe all these people
are passing on flying

145
00:06:48,366 --> 00:06:50,618
to pick up garbage all day. [scoffs]

146
00:06:50,701 --> 00:06:52,453
Have fun, nerds.

147
00:06:52,537 --> 00:06:55,706
I'll be soaring through the air
like a forkin' bird.

148
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:59,210
-Eleanor and I would love to help.
-Ah. Hurrah, hurrah. Yay.

149
00:06:59,335 --> 00:07:00,253
Dude.

150
00:07:00,336 --> 00:07:03,172
You want to prove you're not selfish?
Here's the perfect test.

151
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:05,091
There's something fun that you want to do,

152
00:07:05,174 --> 00:07:07,802
and then there's something less fun that
people are doing for the common good.

153
00:07:07,885 --> 00:07:08,970
Which do you choose?

154
00:07:11,013 --> 00:07:12,557
-Have fun.
-[indistinct chatter]

155
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:14,976

-Whoo!
-Hey, up there.

160
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:27,655
Having fun, or does it
maybe suck, probably?

161
00:07:27,738 --> 00:07:32,535
Well, I wouldn't call it fun. I'd say
it's like 50 million simultaneous orgasms,

162
00:07:32,618 --> 00:07:33,703
but better.

163
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:35,663
How's volunteer garbage pickup?

164
00:07:35,746 --> 00:07:37,707
-About the same.
-Great!

165
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:39,834
Whee!

166
00:07:42,003 --> 00:07:44,881
You know, this really reminds me
of my time in Vietnam,

167
00:07:44,964 --> 00:07:48,509

with my godmother, Diana.

Doesn't really matter of what she's
a princess of. It's not really important.

169
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:53,389
Tahani! How goes the cleaning?

170
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:56,434
Oh, swimmingly, Michael. And I have to say

171
00:07:56,517 --> 00:07:59,520
this neighborhood that you've built
is truly a masterpiece,

172
00:07:59,604 --> 00:08:01,063
the likes of which I've never seen.

173
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:03,274
And I've been to Johnny Depp's
private bird sanctuary.

174
00:08:03,357 --> 00:08:05,985
Well, thank you.
That's very kind of you to say.

175
00:08:06,527 --> 00:08:08,696
But it's also dead wrong.

176
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:11,699
This neighborhood is a disaster.

177
00:08:11,782 --> 00:08:15,328
See, I must have made a mistake somewhere.
And it led to all this chaos,

178
00:08:15,411 --> 00:08:18,039
and now I'm just... I'm just terrified
that it's gonna happen again.

179
00:08:18,122 --> 00:08:20,791
I'm trying to put a good face on...

180
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:23,669
Uh, well, this face that
I've constructed for myself.

181
00:08:23,753 --> 00:08:27,840
But the truth is, I... I'm just miserable.

182
00:08:28,466 --> 00:08:29,592
I have to go.

183
00:08:29,675 --> 00:08:32,094
Thank you so much for your service.

184
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:35,848
Oh, no. Powerful people
do not handle failure well.

185
00:08:35,932 --> 00:08:38,476
Michael could be heading
for a total meltdown.

186
00:08:39,894 --> 00:08:42,730
Soulmate,
are you thinking what I'm thinking?

187
00:08:42,813 --> 00:08:47,401
Should we say it at the same time?
All right. One, two, three.

188
00:08:47,485 --> 00:08:48,903
We must help Michael.

189
00:08:48,986 --> 00:08:51,197
Oh, you sly devil.

190
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:53,282
You're going to keep me
on my toes, aren't you?

191
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:55,117
All right, come on. Let's go.

192
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:57,161
[men laughing]

193
00:08:57,286 --> 00:08:59,747
-[Antonio] Oh, boy!
-Hey, Gunnar! Hey, Antonio!

194
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:02,333
-Hey, Eleanor. Isn't this great?
-Uh, yeah.

195
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:04,210
When I thought of the afterlife,

196
00:09:04,293 --> 00:09:08,464
I totally pictured being
an unpaid, non-flying janitor.

197
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:10,007
Us, too! [laughs]

198
00:09:10,091 --> 00:09:13,594
[laughs sarcastically] You guys
are so fun. Just relentlessly fun.

199
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:16,806
I keep thinking, "When are they
gonna stop being fun?"

200
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:19,767
And the answer is never.
You're never gonna stop.

201
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:20,935
[Antonio and Gunnar laughing]

202
00:09:22,645 --> 00:09:26,274
Well, I have had a pretty full day
of being unselfish.

203
00:09:26,357 --> 00:09:29,819
I've made some new friends.
My area's almost garbage-free.

204
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:33,072
So you're gonna help me figure out
how to stay, right?

205
00:09:33,155 --> 00:09:35,074
Well, that is a really tough question.

206
00:09:35,157 --> 00:09:36,867
Most great philosophers would say

207
00:09:36,951 --> 00:09:39,954
helping you is pointless,
that you can't try to be good,

208
00:09:40,037 --> 00:09:42,498
especially when your motivations
are so obviously corrupt.

209
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:45,501
Yeah, but what do
most great philosophers know?

210
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:48,045
On the other hand, Aristotle
thought that moral virtue is something

211
00:09:48,129 --> 00:09:49,463
that you could get better at.

212
00:09:49,547 --> 00:09:51,716
He... He compared it to playing the flute.

213
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:53,426
The more you practice,
the more you improve.

214
00:09:53,509 --> 00:09:56,887
Aristotle! That's my boy, right there.
He was the best.

215
00:09:56,971 --> 00:09:59,098
I mean, most people agree
he was the best one.

216
00:09:59,181 --> 00:10:03,853
So it sounds to me like you are onboard
the "Help Eleanor" train.

217
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:07,106
Well, I've narrowed it down
to two possibilities, yes and no.

218
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:09,609
Well, no worries.

219
00:10:09,692 --> 00:10:13,446
Just hit me up when you're done
weighing my life in your hands.

220
00:10:13,529 --> 00:10:17,617
I'll just keep doing what I do best:
being super considerate and selfless.

221
00:10:18,993 --> 00:10:19,952
[sighs]

222
00:10:20,036 --> 00:10:22,705
-Hey, guys.
-Okay, Eleanor, reminder.

223
00:10:22,788 --> 00:10:24,498
We switched to a rotating system

224
00:10:24,582 --> 00:10:27,710
for choosing a designated driver,
and it's your turn.

225
00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:29,128
Got it. [chuckles softly]

226
00:10:29,211 --> 00:10:32,173
Full disclosure,
I forgot we were doing this new system.

227
00:10:32,256 --> 00:10:34,967
I got off work early.
I've been here for about an hour,

228
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:36,802
and I'm already pretty drunk.

229
00:10:37,678 --> 00:10:39,764
-Someone else will do it.
-Good call.

230
00:10:39,847 --> 00:10:43,059
Guess the only place I'll be driving
is through the giant loophole

231
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:45,728
in the system I accidentally discovered.

232
00:10:45,811 --> 00:10:47,313
[imitates car horn]

233
00:10:47,396 --> 00:10:48,522
[laughs]

234
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:51,484
Whoo!

235
00:10:51,567 --> 00:10:53,152
[people cheering]

236
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:57,698
I can't believe they've managed to mix
one million flavors together,

237
00:10:57,782 --> 00:11:00,493
and yet, somehow,
I can taste each individual one.

238
00:11:00,576 --> 00:11:01,786
It's remarkable.

239
00:11:01,869 --> 00:11:03,829
I got no-flavor.

240
00:11:04,413 --> 00:11:06,248
-It's all I deserve, really.
-No.

241
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:08,584
Look, I... I appreciate
you trying to cheer me up.

242
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:10,586
I really do, but you don't understand.

243
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:14,173
This was the very first neighborhood
that I got to design.

244
00:11:14,256 --> 00:11:17,426
It was my chance to prove myself,
and now I've blown it.

245
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:20,888
You know, sometimes a flaw
can make something even more beautiful,

246
00:11:20,971 --> 00:11:22,765
like with Cindy Crawford
and how short she is.

247
00:11:22,848 --> 00:11:26,519
Oh, Tahani,
if I made one tiny mistake in my design,

248
00:11:26,602 --> 00:11:29,063
if there's a single glitch in the system,

249
00:11:29,146 --> 00:11:33,692
if even one blade of grass
is angled a fraction of a degree off...

250
00:11:34,443 --> 00:11:36,320
[dog whimpers]

251
00:11:36,404 --> 00:11:40,116
The whole neighborhood is compromised.

252
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:41,367
Whose dog is that?

253
00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:44,286
Guys, whose dog is that?

254
00:11:45,246 --> 00:11:46,580
Whose dog is that?

255
00:11:46,664 --> 00:11:50,418
See, this is one of those glitches
I was talking about.

256
00:11:50,501 --> 00:11:52,837
Nice try, puppy!

257
00:11:53,754 --> 00:11:55,256
[dog whimpering]

258
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:01,303
-[dog barks]
-[thuds]

259
00:12:01,887 --> 00:12:04,807
Phew! [laughs] That was a close one.

260
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:06,350
[Pevita] Teacup!

261
00:12:07,101 --> 00:12:09,937
Hey, have you seen my dog?

262
00:12:13,482 --> 00:12:14,733
[grunts]

263
00:12:16,277 --> 00:12:17,653
[sighs]

264
00:12:17,736 --> 00:12:20,030
Shouldn't these be magical trash bags?

265
00:12:20,114 --> 00:12:21,699
[Janet] Five more minutes, flyers!

266
00:12:21,782 --> 00:12:24,160
-Five more minutes!
-Oh, man, really?

267
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:36,088
Janet, I'm finished with cleanup,
and I'm ready to fly.

268
00:12:36,172 --> 00:12:37,882
-How do I start?
-Hop on the launch pad

269
00:12:37,965 --> 00:12:40,676
and conjure an image
that brings you pure joy.

270
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:43,846
Some people think of their wedding day
or favorite vacation spot.

271
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:47,057
[sighs] People puking on roller coasters.

272
00:12:47,141 --> 00:12:49,977
People puking on roller coasters.

273
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:52,438
[gasps and laughs] It's working!

274
00:12:52,521 --> 00:12:55,357
-Ow! What the fork?
-[thunder breaking]

275
00:12:57,735 --> 00:13:01,989
Janet, any chance this is
a scheduled trash storm?

276
00:13:03,574 --> 00:13:05,701
So here's the situation, Pevita.

277
00:13:06,243 --> 00:13:08,746
I kind of kicked your dog into the sun.

278
00:13:08,829 --> 00:13:10,289
But I got her back.

279
00:13:10,372 --> 00:13:13,667
-[dog whimpers]
-Everything... Everything seems fine.

280
00:13:13,751 --> 00:13:16,587
Teacup, thank goodness you're okay.

281
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:19,673
Everyone, it is merely
a construct of a dog.

282
00:13:19,757 --> 00:13:22,801
It feels no pain or joy or love.

283
00:13:23,385 --> 00:13:24,762
Teacup doesn't love me?

284
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:27,014
Oh!

285
00:13:27,097 --> 00:13:29,517
Oh, no, no, no, no, no,
it definitely feels love.

286
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,144
Do you actually want a dog
that loves you a little bit more?

287
00:13:32,228 --> 00:13:33,896
Because I can kick her
right back into the sun

288
00:13:33,979 --> 00:13:35,189
and get you another one just like that.

289
00:13:35,272 --> 00:13:37,900
-No!
-Oh, boy. I'm making things worse.

290
00:13:37,983 --> 00:13:40,653
Okay, all right, that's all right.
Breathe. Breathe. Do you breathe?

291
00:13:40,736 --> 00:13:42,029
If you do, then just breathe

292
00:13:42,112 --> 00:13:44,698
'cause everything's fine, Michael,
it's fine.

293
00:13:44,782 --> 00:13:45,824
[gasps]

294
00:13:45,908 --> 00:13:47,201
[wind whooshing]

295
00:13:47,284 --> 00:13:50,079
[Tahani] It's raining garbage. Run!

296
00:13:50,746 --> 00:13:53,040
No, no, no, I'm gonna run this way.

297
00:13:53,123 --> 00:13:54,750
[grunting]

298
00:13:59,088 --> 00:14:02,216
[panting] Chidi! Hey.
Before you say anything...

299
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:06,011
That's it, I just don't
want you to say anything.

300
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:07,846
-What did you do?
-Nothing!

301
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:12,268
It just started raining trash
out of nowhere for no reason at all.

302
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:15,563
[shrieks] Okay, fine, fine.

303
00:14:15,646 --> 00:14:17,731
My bag broke, and I ditched the trash

304
00:14:17,815 --> 00:14:19,525
instead of taking it
all the way to the dumpster.

305
00:14:19,608 --> 00:14:21,652
But in my defense,

306
00:14:21,735 --> 00:14:24,905
there were only five minutes left
in flying and I wanted to go flying.

307
00:14:24,989 --> 00:14:27,449
How is that a defense?
You made a bad choice.

308
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:31,161
I made a bad choice?
We could have literally been flying,

309
00:14:31,245 --> 00:14:33,622
and all you wanted to do
was talk about morals.

310
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:36,000
I mean, you're like
the worst part of Superman.

311
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:38,961
This is a relief.
I can stop my deliberations.

312
00:14:39,044 --> 00:14:41,797
You're a selfish person,
and it is pointless to help you.

313
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:42,882
You are on your own.

314
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:43,966
[Antonio] Oh, man.

315
00:14:45,676 --> 00:14:48,637
-How 'bout this trash storm, Gunnar?
-More cleaning up to do.

316
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:51,223
-It's a... It's a dream come true.
-[crashes]

317
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:52,516
[gasps]

318
00:14:55,769 --> 00:14:57,730
-We're okay!
-[sighs]

319
00:14:57,813 --> 00:14:58,898
You can't die here.

320
00:14:58,981 --> 00:15:02,401
Come on, I mean, even you have to admit,
those guys are psycho.

321
00:15:02,484 --> 00:15:03,986
[garbage clattering]

322
00:15:05,779 --> 00:15:08,866
I don't know what's happening to me.
I mean, it's my duty

323
00:15:08,949 --> 00:15:11,994
to be calm and in control
and I'm falling apart.

324
00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:15,372
No, Michael, you are
a paragon of fortitude.

325
00:15:15,456 --> 00:15:17,124
-[scoffs]
-You're a mountain of strength.

326
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,586
I'm not a mountain of strength.

327
00:15:20,669 --> 00:15:22,254
I'm a canyon...

328
00:15:23,005 --> 00:15:25,382
full of poo-poo. [sobbing]

329
00:15:25,883 --> 00:15:27,843
Jianyu, the architect of this neighborhood

330
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:31,513
has just referred to himself
as a canyon full of poo-poo.

331
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:33,807
Surely now you will say something.

332
00:15:33,891 --> 00:15:37,102
Grace us with your vocalized wisdom.
Please, I'm begging you.

333
00:15:48,739 --> 00:15:51,200
[sniffling] Oh.

334
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:57,164
Yes, yes, I understand.

335
00:15:57,247 --> 00:16:00,876
The strength is inside me.
It's been there all along.

336
00:16:01,543 --> 00:16:04,046
No, of course,
I can overcome any obstacle.

337
00:16:04,838 --> 00:16:06,799
Oh, thank you, Jianyu, thank you.

338
00:16:09,593 --> 00:16:11,929
[chuckles] I'm back.

339
00:16:15,432 --> 00:16:16,809
You did it.

340
00:16:16,892 --> 00:16:19,395
Oh, you have so much to teach me.

341
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:21,605
Maybe I should try to be silent, too.

342
00:16:21,689 --> 00:16:24,483
No really, look. Here I go.

343
00:16:27,236 --> 00:16:30,155
Oh! That was wonderful! So cleansing.

344
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:38,580
-[indistinct chatter]
-[people laughing]

345
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:42,126
Just water tonight, huh?
Designated driver?

346
00:16:42,209 --> 00:16:44,670
-Yeah, it sucks.
-I think it's awesome.

347
00:16:44,753 --> 00:16:46,630
I mean, someone's got to do it, right?

348
00:16:46,714 --> 00:16:48,465
I think it's a cool thing
to do for people.

349
00:16:49,466 --> 00:16:51,010
Yeah. No, I meant...

350
00:16:51,093 --> 00:16:54,972
I meant it sucks that I can't do it
more often, you know?

351
00:16:55,055 --> 00:16:57,182
I actually prefer it to drinking.

352
00:16:57,266 --> 00:17:01,353
Staying sober and knowing
my friends will get home safe,

353
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:03,313
that's my buzz.

354
00:17:06,567 --> 00:17:08,694
Hey, guys, good news and bad news.

355
00:17:08,777 --> 00:17:13,490
See that hot bartender over there?
He's into me, and we're gonna bang it out.

356
00:17:13,574 --> 00:17:15,743
The bad news is, it means
I can't drive you guys home.

357
00:17:15,826 --> 00:17:18,787
-But I did call a cab for you guys.
-[sighs]

358
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:21,540
But they recognized my number,
and they didn't want to come.

359
00:17:21,623 --> 00:17:23,500
I've thrown up in a lot of cabs.

360
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:25,711
So are we good here?

361
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:29,339
Eleanor, you have
a very important choice to make.

362
00:17:29,423 --> 00:17:30,507
If you blow us off,

363
00:17:30,591 --> 00:17:34,303
you are banned from
Thursday night drinks forever.

364
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:38,599
Yeah, I'm good with that.

365
00:17:38,682 --> 00:17:40,601
I'll see you guys at work. Peace!

366
00:17:40,684 --> 00:17:42,478
You, let's go.

367
00:17:44,521 --> 00:17:45,731
[sighs]

368
00:17:55,491 --> 00:17:57,701
Hey. How did you know I was here?

369
00:17:57,785 --> 00:17:59,536
I saw you from my window.

370
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:03,290
That's where I live, by the way.
Not that you ever asked.

371
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:06,043
What are you doing?

372
00:18:06,126 --> 00:18:10,881
I went to all the places
where I dumped trash earlier

373
00:18:10,964 --> 00:18:13,509
and cleaned it up
so it couldn't be traced back to me.

374
00:18:14,384 --> 00:18:16,845
Well, it looks like you
cleaned up everything.

375
00:18:18,514 --> 00:18:20,307
You're doing this because you feel bad.

376
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:22,643
And you're not even doing it
to get me to help you anymore,

377
00:18:22,726 --> 00:18:24,895
because I told you
that's not gonna happen.

378
00:18:25,521 --> 00:18:27,272
Okay, yeah, fine, I felt bad

379
00:18:27,356 --> 00:18:31,276
for stupid Gunnar and stupider Antonio
and the whole neighborhood.

380
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:34,279
I felt bad about what I did.
It was a weird feeling.

381
00:18:34,363 --> 00:18:36,323
Not used to it. Didn't love it.

382
00:18:36,406 --> 00:18:39,243
Well, feeling remorse about being wrong

383
00:18:39,326 --> 00:18:42,621
isn't as good as just doing
something right, but it's a start.

384
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:46,166
-Look, I think you're capable of change.
-[sighs]

385
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:49,044
And I will help you try.

386
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:52,756
Oh, wow, man,
I swear I won't let you down.

387
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:55,551
Hi there. I've collected the
worst-smelling garbage that I could find.

388
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:58,387
Do you still want me to dump it
inside of Antonio's house?

389
00:18:59,596 --> 00:19:01,974
[exclaims] What? No.

390
00:19:02,057 --> 00:19:05,310
I did not tell you to do that.
You are<i> loco,</i> girlfriend.

391
00:19:05,394 --> 00:19:07,729
Okay, I won't let you down starting now.

392
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:12,609
[indistinct chatter]

393
00:19:13,735 --> 00:19:15,779
Ah, Eleanor. Good morning.

394
00:19:15,863 --> 00:19:18,282
Michael, do you know
what the best part about this place is?

395
00:19:18,365 --> 00:19:20,367
You figured out how to make a to-go cup

396
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:22,953
that doesn't leak right where
the seam meets the lid.

397
00:19:23,036 --> 00:19:26,081
Oh, I'm so glad you noticed.
I was very proud of that.

398
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:28,000
One of the hardest problems
I had to solve.

399
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:31,712
Eleanor, I know what you did.

400
00:19:33,463 --> 00:19:35,716
Cleaning up the entire
neighborhood by yourself.

401
00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:39,678
[laughs] I knew you were special,
but this is proof.

402
00:19:39,761 --> 00:19:43,557
Well, I was just doing my part.
You know, and, um...

403
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:47,477
Since I'm special, your words,
I didn't get to fly.

404
00:19:47,561 --> 00:19:52,065
I'm sorry. No, I've had to ban flying
for 1,000 years. Too many injuries.

405
00:19:52,149 --> 00:19:56,987
One resident hit a rotting turkey carcass
at a 1,000 miles an hour.

406
00:19:57,070 --> 00:20:03,076
It just exploded into this fireball
of turkey flesh and bones and sinew.

407
00:20:05,746 --> 00:20:09,291
Anyway, enjoy your coffee. And the cup.

408
00:20:11,752 --> 00:20:14,963
So I have moved out
of my apartment officially

409
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:16,465
and into your guest room.

410
00:20:16,548 --> 00:20:17,883
Figured it would cause less suspicion

411
00:20:17,966 --> 00:20:20,594
and make things easier
for our "good person" lessons.

412
00:20:20,677 --> 00:20:23,931
Cool. Uh, just FYI,
I'm a very loud snorer.

413
00:20:24,014 --> 00:20:27,476
And I like to drip dry in the nude,
so eyes to yourself, perv.

414
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:31,647
Okay. Fine. Now you got a long way to go
to pull this off.

415
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:36,526
It will take hours and hours
of studying ethics and moral philosophy.

416
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:40,948
We're gonna have assignments
and quizzes and papers.

417
00:20:41,031 --> 00:20:43,075
It's gonna be so much fun.

418
00:20:43,158 --> 00:20:45,118
Remind me what I'm getting
out of this again.

419
00:20:45,202 --> 00:20:47,287
You get to avoid eternal damnation.

420
00:20:47,371 --> 00:20:49,122
{\an8}Oh, yeah. Right.

421
00:20:49,206 --> 00:20:51,959
{\an8}-Hey, I got you a present.
-What?

422
00:20:52,542 --> 00:20:54,127
{\an8}Senegal.

423
00:20:54,211 --> 00:20:56,463
{\an8}That's not a present.
That's just common decency.

424
00:20:56,546 --> 00:20:58,632
{\an8}Yeah, but I forkin' nailed it.

425
00:20:59,633 --> 00:21:00,926
{\an8}Good talk.

426
00:21:19,569 --> 00:21:22,489
Aw, shirt.
