1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:02,127
[Judge] So, Michael,

2
00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:05,755
you're saying there's a new angle
I should consider in this case?

3
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:09,050
Love that. Major drama. [chuckles]

4
00:00:09,134 --> 00:00:10,552
Spill the tea, sweetheart.

5
00:00:10,635 --> 00:00:11,886
The premise of our system

6
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:15,056
is that a person's score
during her time on Earth

7
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:17,892
is final and inarguable.

8
00:00:17,976 --> 00:00:20,437
But, because of my accidental experiment,

9
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:25,066
these four humans got better
after they died.

10
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:26,776
That's not supposed to be possible.

11
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:31,531
Over and over, I watched as they became
thoughtful and generous and caring.

12
00:00:31,614 --> 00:00:33,366
And think about where they started.

13
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:36,161
Uh, Jason. Growing up in Jacksonville,

14
00:00:36,244 --> 00:00:38,705
what did you do for fun
after school every day?

15
00:00:38,788 --> 00:00:41,916
Me and my friends whipped
empty spray paint cans at flamingos.

16
00:00:42,584 --> 00:00:44,419
And now he's so much better.

17
00:00:44,502 --> 00:00:48,214
I was already good.
When I was six, I hit one on the butt.

18
00:00:48,298 --> 00:00:49,841
Let the immortal beings talk, darling.

19
00:00:49,924 --> 00:00:51,843
So they got better
in your little pretend world.

20
00:00:51,926 --> 00:00:55,013
That doesn't prove anything
about what they were like on Earth.

21
00:00:55,096 --> 00:00:57,640
No, see, I think it does prove something.

22
00:00:58,224 --> 00:01:02,395
If I'm right, the system
by which we judge humans,

23
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:06,858
the very method we use
to deem them good or bad,

24
00:01:06,941 --> 00:01:10,653
is so fundamentally flawed
and unreasonable

25
00:01:10,737 --> 00:01:14,491
that hundreds of millions of people
have been wrongly condemned

26
00:01:14,574 --> 00:01:17,243
to an eternity of torture.

27
00:01:18,787 --> 00:01:20,955
Damn! That was intense.

28
00:01:21,539 --> 00:01:24,250
Look at my arm, y'all.
Look, I got goose bumps.

29
00:01:24,918 --> 00:01:27,378
-Huh. Yeah.
-Doesn't happen very often.

30
00:01:27,462 --> 00:01:29,464
[theme music playing]

31
00:01:34,219 --> 00:01:36,971
{\an8}Wow. So you saw your parents in the test?

32
00:01:37,055 --> 00:01:40,934
{\an8}Yes, and I immediately fell right back
into my old pattern.

33
00:01:41,017 --> 00:01:44,687
{\an8}Desperately trying to impress them
and earn their admiration.

34
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:47,816
{\an8}Then I heard this little voice
in my head saying,

35
00:01:47,899 --> 00:01:50,151
{\an8}"Tahani, don't do this."

36
00:01:50,235 --> 00:01:53,238
{\an8}The voice in your head sounds like
the old lady from <i>Downton Abbey?</i>

37
00:01:53,321 --> 00:01:56,241
{\an8}Oh, yes, sorry.
Maggie Smith is my godmother.

38
00:01:56,825 --> 00:01:59,160
{\an8}Anyway, I took a deep breath,

39
00:01:59,244 --> 00:02:02,664
{\an8}told them I ate a Cheeto and walked away.

40
00:02:02,747 --> 00:02:08,336
{\an8}Man, you have made so much progress.
I'm proud of you, hot stuff.

41
00:02:09,546 --> 00:02:14,676
{\an8}Whatever progress I have made,
it's because you and I have become mates.

42
00:02:15,844 --> 00:02:17,303
{\an8}That's British for friends.

43
00:02:17,387 --> 00:02:18,805
{\an8}-No, I know.
-Oh.

44
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:23,726
{\an8}Man, think about everything
that's happened to us.

45
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:28,189
{\an8}We died, Michael tortured us,
we teamed up with him, we escaped.

46
00:02:28,273 --> 00:02:30,316
{\an8}We went through the portal,
the Judge ruled against us,

47
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,860
{\an8}then Michael showed up.

48
00:02:31,943 --> 00:02:35,488
This has been one of
the craziest years of my life. [chuckles]

49
00:02:35,572 --> 00:02:37,657
-One of?
-Yeah.

50
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:42,162
I'm not sure what I would do
if one more insane thing happened.

51
00:02:42,245 --> 00:02:44,164
Hi, Jason. I love you.

52
00:02:44,747 --> 00:02:46,082
Oh, word?

53
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:48,960
Word. I've been avoiding telling you.

54
00:02:49,043 --> 00:02:52,755
My excuse was that I needed time
to evaluate my complex feelings,

55
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:54,257
but that was a rationalization.

56
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:58,511
This might be the last time
I ever get to talk to you, so there it is.

57
00:02:58,595 --> 00:03:02,098
I love you. And I hereby
stop avoiding this topic

58
00:03:02,181 --> 00:03:05,602
and rationalizing it by saying
the situation's complicated.

59
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:10,273
Or that my brain is grinding
like a fork in a garbage disposal.

60
00:03:10,356 --> 00:03:14,152
All right, whatever.
You're not really a part of this, Chidi.

61
00:03:15,069 --> 00:03:17,196
[Jason] Hey, guess what.

62
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,365
I think I love you, too, girl.

63
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:20,533
I'm not a girl.

64
00:03:20,617 --> 00:03:23,786
I'm also not just a Janet anymore.
I don't know what I am.

65
00:03:27,332 --> 00:03:28,708
Hey, man. What's up?

66
00:03:38,676 --> 00:03:40,261
Hot diggity dog!

67
00:03:41,179 --> 00:03:43,681
Oh, no. Now the thing I said

68
00:03:43,765 --> 00:03:46,517
right after we kissed will always be,
"Hot diggity dog."

69
00:03:46,601 --> 00:03:48,978
Whatever. It was an honest reaction.
I stand by it.

70
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:51,397
Hi, guys, couple quick announcements.

71
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:53,650
Would anyone eat chips and guac
if I put it out?

72
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:55,526
It's good. It's homemade.

73
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:57,153
No takers? A'ight.

74
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:59,864
Second thing, we figured out a plan
to save your souls.

75
00:03:59,948 --> 00:04:04,827
For the time being, the Judge is gonna
put you in your own Medium Places,

76
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:05,995
like Mindy St. Claire.

77
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:09,249
And while you're there, I'll keep working
every angle I can think of

78
00:04:09,332 --> 00:04:11,960
to get you guys into
the Good Place for real.

79
00:04:12,043 --> 00:04:13,628
This is great. So we'd all be together?

80
00:04:13,711 --> 00:04:16,130
Oh, no, that's the thing
about Medium Places.

81
00:04:16,214 --> 00:04:19,175
It has to be tailored
to what's medium for the individual,

82
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:21,803
so if you're all together,
it ain't medium.

83
00:04:22,387 --> 00:04:24,013
How much time will we be alone?

84
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:26,933
Hard to say. Uh, could be a month.

85
00:04:27,016 --> 00:04:28,768
Could be a million years.

86
00:04:28,851 --> 00:04:31,145
So, between a month and a million years.

87
00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:32,647
-Yeah. Somewhere in there.
-Give or take.

88
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:34,065
[Michael] Come on, you guys.

89
00:04:34,148 --> 00:04:37,068
I know this isn't perfect,
but I need more time to build my case.

90
00:04:37,151 --> 00:04:39,028
And it's either this

91
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:40,947
-or back to the Bad Place.
-Yeah.

92
00:04:42,073 --> 00:04:44,993
I'll say it. Both those options suck.

93
00:04:45,076 --> 00:04:47,537
Sorry if that's blunt,
Your Honor, but it's true.

94
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:50,415
Also, Chidi laid one on me,
so I'm kinda dizzy. [chuckles]

95
00:04:50,498 --> 00:04:53,668
You two kissed? Hot diggity dog.

96
00:04:53,751 --> 00:04:54,794
That's what I said.

97
00:04:54,877 --> 00:04:57,588
The point is, we've all gotten better.

98
00:04:57,672 --> 00:05:00,174
Why should we have to go live alone
in a boring void

99
00:05:00,258 --> 00:05:01,634
because of a messed-up system?

100
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:03,428
How is that justice?

101
00:05:03,511 --> 00:05:07,056
Okay, slow your roll there,
Erin Brockovich.

102
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:08,266
First of all,

103
00:05:08,349 --> 00:05:12,395
y'all didn't get good enough
to pass the tests I just gave you.

104
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:15,189
Second, I still believe
that the only reason

105
00:05:15,273 --> 00:05:17,650
that you improved
in Michael's fake neighborhood

106
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:22,071
is because you thought there was a reward
at the end of the rainbow.

107
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:25,575
You're supposed to do good things
because you're good,

108
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:28,161
not because you're seeking moral dessert.

109
00:05:28,244 --> 00:05:31,873
And I still believe
that they would've become good people

110
00:05:31,956 --> 00:05:33,791
if they'd just gotten a...

111
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:40,256
A push in the right direction.

112
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:43,176
Oh, no.

113
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:46,304
-No. Nope. Absolutely not.
-It's a little crazy.

114
00:05:46,387 --> 00:05:48,765
"A little crazy"? It's looney tunes.

115
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:50,433
-What are they talking about?
-No idea.

116
00:05:50,516 --> 00:05:51,934
It sets a very dangerous precedent.

117
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:53,603
It's only four people.

118
00:05:53,686 --> 00:05:57,482
And it's clearly the best way to see
if bad people can become good

119
00:05:57,565 --> 00:06:00,526
without knowing anything
about what's waiting in the afterlife.

120
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:01,486
[Jason] Shotgun.

121
00:06:01,569 --> 00:06:02,487
Whatever they're talking about,

122
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:04,030
if there's a shotgun, I call shotgun.

123
00:06:04,113 --> 00:06:05,364
-It's never gonna work.
-If it doesn't,

124
00:06:05,448 --> 00:06:07,283
-then they go right back to the Bad Place.
-[sighs]

125
00:06:07,366 --> 00:06:09,577
No one gets hurt, except them.

126
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:13,414
Forever. And me, I assume, also forever.

127
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:14,499
[clicks tongue]

128
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:16,417
Mmm...

129
00:06:16,501 --> 00:06:17,919
[grunting]

130
00:06:19,253 --> 00:06:22,090
-Okay, let's do it.
-Yes. [chuckles]

131
00:06:22,173 --> 00:06:23,883
I don't know why. I'm just feeling funky.

132
00:06:23,966 --> 00:06:25,510
But there have to be strict rules.

133
00:06:25,593 --> 00:06:27,845
Otherwise, the results will be tainted.

134
00:06:27,929 --> 00:06:31,724
And I reserve the right
to change my mind at any point.

135
00:06:31,808 --> 00:06:32,892
About what?

136
00:06:32,975 --> 00:06:36,604
Would someone who's not an eternal being
please explain to me what the--

137
00:06:36,687 --> 00:06:37,772
[Judge clicks fingers]

138
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:40,775
[man] Why are you like this?

139
00:06:40,858 --> 00:06:43,069
Excuse me? "Why am I like this?"

140
00:06:43,152 --> 00:06:44,695
You don't know me, dude.

141
00:06:44,779 --> 00:06:46,072
You don't know what I'm like.

142
00:06:46,656 --> 00:06:48,574
Look what you made me do, jagoff.

143
00:06:48,658 --> 00:06:49,617
[sighs]

144
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:51,494
-Look out!
-Uh-oh.

145
00:06:52,703 --> 00:06:53,538
[gasps]

146
00:07:05,967 --> 00:07:06,968
Holy crap.

147
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:09,345
I just almost died.

148
00:07:10,346 --> 00:07:12,723
<i>She needs to know what was said</i>
<i>that's so unfair. </i>

149
00:07:12,807 --> 00:07:15,143
[girl on TV]<i> First of all, </i>
<i>this is just yesterday...</i>

150
00:07:15,226 --> 00:07:17,478
God, Eleanor. Take longer next time.

151
00:07:17,562 --> 00:07:19,063
Oh, you look like crap.

152
00:07:20,022 --> 00:07:24,444
I was outside the supermarket arguing
with that little environmental twerp.

153
00:07:24,527 --> 00:07:26,112
-Ugh, I hate that guy.
-[Brittany] Really?

154
00:07:26,195 --> 00:07:29,031
That skinny little hippie body
kinda turns me on.

155
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:30,783
-Gross. [chuckles]
-[Eleanor] Guys, listen.

156
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:32,618
I dropped the margarita mix.

157
00:07:32,702 --> 00:07:35,246
And when I went to pick it up,

158
00:07:35,329 --> 00:07:38,583
a bunch of shopping carts came
right at me and I was frozen.

159
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:41,085
And then someone pushed me out of the way

160
00:07:41,169 --> 00:07:45,631
and the carts got demolished by a truck.

161
00:07:46,424 --> 00:07:47,842
I mean, I could've died.

162
00:07:47,925 --> 00:07:49,302
Oh, my God.

163
00:07:49,385 --> 00:07:50,845
Whoa. That's crazy.

164
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:54,307
So is the margarita mix gone?

165
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:56,100
[Val] I had a near-death
experience recently.

166
00:07:56,184 --> 00:07:58,394
You know that old warehouse
that burned down last month

167
00:07:58,478 --> 00:07:59,770
and four people died?

168
00:07:59,854 --> 00:08:03,232
That building is right by my old dentist.

169
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:07,028
If I still went to that dentist
and had an appointment that day,

170

Hey, you look happy.
Did you get laid last night?

182
00:09:03,084 --> 00:09:05,044
I didn't. Tried. Hard,

183
00:09:05,127 --> 00:09:07,713
with this chick that
I followed into a yoga class,

184
00:09:07,797 --> 00:09:09,173

Listen, dude. What you're doing here,

00:09:18,307 --> 00:09:22,228
selling fake medicine to people,
tricking them, is wrong.

Yeah. And?

I have a calcium deficiency.

No, I'm not gonna hurt you, man.
I came to apologize.

[clears throat] Nope, you're right.
I didn't.

I apologize for being mean to you,

There's really no excuse.

Could you help me?

336
00:16:42,084 --> 00:16:44,753
Last year, on my birthday I almost died,

337
00:16:45,462 --> 00:16:51,301
and then I did a bunch of stuff
that was good, but weird,

338
00:16:51,385 --> 00:16:54,096
and then I stopped, and now I'm here.

339
00:16:55,055 --> 00:16:58,183
-Sounds like you had a pretty crazy year.
-Hmm.

340
00:16:58,767 --> 00:17:00,853
Want to talk about it?

341
00:17:01,562 --> 00:17:04,815
And in the end, Anthony Anderson
and Jerry O'Connell

342
00:17:04,898 --> 00:17:06,567
start a successful shampoo company,

343
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:10,070
and you see the kangaroo
jumping around Australia.

344
00:17:10,154 --> 00:17:11,655
[laughing]

345
00:17:11,739 --> 00:17:15,784
That is the plot
to the movie <i>Kangaroo Jack. </i>

346
00:17:16,368 --> 00:17:18,787
-Why did I tell you that?
-It's unclear.

347
00:17:19,496 --> 00:17:23,500
You know, the thing is the problem
really with being a do-gooder?

348
00:17:24,084 --> 00:17:26,170
-What's that?
-No one cares.

349
00:17:26,253 --> 00:17:28,505
I mean, some people care a little bit.

350
00:17:28,589 --> 00:17:32,009
The twerpy little twerps
from the environmental place, they care,

351
00:17:32,092 --> 00:17:34,845
but I was a good person for six months.

352
00:17:35,512 --> 00:17:37,347
That's like five years.

353
00:17:37,431 --> 00:17:41,852
And it felt okay,
but not as good as I thought it would.

354
00:17:41,935 --> 00:17:44,354
And what did I get for it?

355
00:17:44,438 --> 00:17:47,524
Ah, see? Now you're talking
about moral dessert.

356
00:17:47,608 --> 00:17:48,609
Exactly.

357
00:17:49,943 --> 00:17:52,780
-Wait, I am? What?
-Moral dessert is the concept

358
00:17:52,863 --> 00:17:56,909
that if you act with virtue,
you deserve a reward.

359
00:17:56,992 --> 00:18:00,496
Right. If I'm not gonna get rewarded
somehow with a tiara

360
00:18:00,579 --> 00:18:03,457
or one of those diagonal award belts...

361
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:04,958
-Sash.
-Sure.

362
00:18:05,042 --> 00:18:07,294
Then why should I do good things?

363
00:18:08,212 --> 00:18:12,341
You know, I had a friend that said
whenever she was doing something bad,

364
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:15,260
she'd hear this little voice in her head.

365
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:19,473
Distant little voice saying,
"Come on, now, you know this is wrong."

366
00:18:19,556 --> 00:18:22,768
And then when she started
doing good things,

367
00:18:22,851 --> 00:18:25,604
that voice went away. It was a relief.

368
00:18:26,188 --> 00:18:31,652
Your friend sounds like she's one pickle
short of a pickle party. [chuckles]

369
00:18:32,236 --> 00:18:36,824
She was a little rough around the edges,
but she was also a really good person.

370
00:18:36,907 --> 00:18:37,825
When she tried.

371
00:18:37,908 --> 00:18:41,286
See, I think that little voice
was her conscience

372
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:43,872
trying to guide her
in the right direction.

373
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:47,459
I gotta go home. What do I owe ya?

374
00:18:47,543 --> 00:18:49,169
The real question, Eleanor,

375
00:18:50,838 --> 00:18:52,256
is what do we owe to each other?

376
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:57,302
What? Did I sell you a drink?
Am I a bartender?

377
00:18:57,386 --> 00:18:59,471
[chuckles] Drinks are on me.

378
00:19:00,514 --> 00:19:01,890
Good luck.

379
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:07,604
Ow!

380
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:10,649
[machines clacking]

381
00:19:12,776 --> 00:19:15,154
-Anybody notice I was gone?
-Nope.

382
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:20,159

00:19:33,922 --> 00:19:35,883
[Chidi through speakers]
<i>What do we owe to each other? </i>

384
00:19:35,966 --> 00:19:39,928
{\an8}<i>That is the question</i>

385
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:44,266
{\an8}<i>and it is the question I will try </i>
<i>to answer over the next three hours.</i>

386
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:45,851
{\an8}Ugh, no, thanks.

{\an8}[Chidi] <i>We all have a voice in our head.</i>

388
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:51,231
{\an8}<i>That voice doesn't tell us what to do</i>
<i>or not do,</i>

389
00:19:51,315 --> 00:19:53,483
{\an8}<i>but it does warn us </i>

393
00:20:01,825 --> 00:20:03,577
<i>I may have a different definition</i>

394
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:04,995
<i>So why do it, then?</i>

395
00:20:05,078 --> 00:20:07,331
<i>Why choose to be good every day</i>

396
00:20:07,414 --> 00:20:10,584
<i>if there is no guaranteed reward</i>

397
00:20:10,667 --> 00:20:12,586
<i>now or in the afterlife?</i>

398
00:20:12,669 --> 00:20:16,548
<i>I argue that we choose to be good </i>
<i>because of our bonds with other people</i>

399
00:20:16,632 --> 00:20:20,302

400

401
00:20:25,432 --> 00:20:29,436
{\an8}Hi, dog bait. Didn't you get my message?
Let's go. Time is booze. [chuckles]

402
00:20:29,519 --> 00:20:34,650
{\an8}Yeah, no, thanks.
I'm going somewhere else.

403
00:20:40,197 --> 00:20:42,866
{\an8}-G'day, where you headed?
-Saint John's University, please.

404
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:43,951
{\an8}No worries.

{\an8}[machines clacking]

-Hi.
-I'm sorry. Office hours are on Tuesday.

407
00:21:00,676 --> 00:21:04,596
Oh, I'm not a student.
Are you Chidi Ana... Kendrick?

408
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,765
Anagonye. And, yes.

409
00:21:06,848 --> 00:21:09,810
From the long, nerdy video about
the voice that tells you to be good?

410
00:21:09,893 --> 00:21:11,603
From the Keswick Foundation lecture series

411
00:21:11,687 --> 00:21:14,439
on practical applications
of ethical theory, yes.

412
00:21:14,523 --> 00:21:17,067
Great. Hi, my name is Eleanor Shellstrop.

413
00:21:18,443 --> 00:21:19,444
Can we talk?

[machines clacking]

415
00:21:22,364 --> 00:21:25,617
Okay. Here we go.
