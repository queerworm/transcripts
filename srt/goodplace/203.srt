1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:02,794
{\an8}[Michael] <i>We're on the same page.</i>

2
00:00:02,877 --> 00:00:04,546
{\an8}I wanna team up with you.

3
00:00:04,629 --> 00:00:07,132
{\an8}What? Why? You do? What?

4
00:00:07,215 --> 00:00:09,843
{\an8}I'm in a bit of a bind.
I could use backup.

5
00:00:09,926 --> 00:00:12,595
{\an8}So, what do you say? New best friends?

6
00:00:13,805 --> 00:00:14,639
{\an8}Stop.

7
00:00:14,723 --> 00:00:15,849
You wanna team up?

8
00:00:15,932 --> 00:00:18,518
You've been torturing us
and lying about it.

9
00:00:18,601 --> 00:00:20,729
Oh, let's not get caught up
on "who lied to whom"

10
00:00:20,812 --> 00:00:25,066
or "which one of us created
an entire fake reality in order to

11
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:28,820
cause eternal misery for the others."
That's ancient history.

12
00:00:28,903 --> 00:00:30,655
It was happening until 20 seconds ago.

13
00:00:30,739 --> 00:00:31,948
The point is that...

14
00:00:33,158 --> 00:00:35,118
circumstances have changed,

15
00:00:35,201 --> 00:00:38,496
and now all of us teaming up
is our best option.

16
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:39,956
I love being on teams.

17
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:42,667
Oh, we need a team name. Um...

18
00:00:42,751 --> 00:00:44,544
-The Bobcats.
-Great.

19
00:00:44,627 --> 00:00:45,545
Slow down, ding-dong.

20
00:00:45,628 --> 00:00:49,632
He wouldn't offer us a deal for no reason.
He needs us.

21
00:00:49,716 --> 00:00:50,842
Why?

22
00:00:50,925 --> 00:00:54,304
Because, as you said, you keep beating me.

23
00:00:54,387 --> 00:00:56,639
Look, I built this neighborhood

24
00:00:56,723 --> 00:01:02,145
as a way to torture the four of you,
psychologically, for thousands of years.

25
00:01:02,228 --> 00:01:06,441
And you keep figuring it out
and taking all the fun out of it.

26
00:01:06,524 --> 00:01:07,734
"Fun"?

27
00:01:07,817 --> 00:01:10,987
Today, there was a new development,
really chapped my nips.

28
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:14,616
One of my employees
is blackmailing me. Vicky.

29
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,161
She runs the clam chowder place
in the main square,

30
00:01:18,244 --> 00:01:19,537
A Little Bit Chowder Now.

31
00:01:19,621 --> 00:01:21,873
Oh, the place with the chowder fountain?

32
00:01:21,956 --> 00:01:23,208
No, that's Pump Up the Clam.

33
00:01:23,291 --> 00:01:26,503
A Little Bit Chowder Now has the lazy
river of chowder. [mimics retching]

34
00:01:26,586 --> 00:01:28,797
How did we ever think
this was the Good Place?

35
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:32,509
Vicky thinks she can
run this neighborhood better than I can.

36
00:01:32,592 --> 00:01:35,762
And she wants to start her version
in 30 minutes.

37
00:01:35,845 --> 00:01:39,098
I'm supposed to reboot you,
erase your memory,

38
00:01:39,182 --> 00:01:41,309
and turn control over to her.

39
00:01:41,392 --> 00:01:44,771
How can we team up
if you wipe our memories again?

40
00:01:44,854 --> 00:01:47,065
Easy. I'm not going to.

41
00:01:47,148 --> 00:01:49,734
You're going to act like
you've been rebooted

42
00:01:49,818 --> 00:01:52,570
and pretend Vicky and the others
are torturing you.

43
00:01:52,654 --> 00:01:55,240
But then, on your own time, in private,

44
00:01:55,323 --> 00:01:59,119
you can study ethics, ogle mailmen,
do whatever you want.

45
00:01:59,202 --> 00:02:01,412
-Can I play iPad?
-Sure you can, buddy.

46
00:02:01,496 --> 00:02:04,165
-Yes!
-Guys, there's no debate here.

47
00:02:04,249 --> 00:02:07,460
My boss gave me two chances
to make this work.

48
00:02:07,544 --> 00:02:11,047
Suffice to say,
I tried more than two times.

49
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:14,425
If he finds out, we're all in hot water.

50
00:02:14,509 --> 00:02:17,053
Literally, they will boil us.

51
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:20,765
We will be the main ingredient
in a chowder of pain.

52
00:02:22,433 --> 00:02:24,394
Human meeting. Bedroom. Now.

53
00:02:26,271 --> 00:02:30,984
Oh, yeah, um... That whole "no stair"
thing, that was, uh, part of the torture.

54
00:02:31,067 --> 00:02:32,318
Let me...

55
00:02:34,696 --> 00:02:36,239
Son of a bench.

56
00:02:36,322 --> 00:02:38,324
[theme music playing]

57
00:02:42,871 --> 00:02:44,247
{\an8}Anyone have any ideas?

58
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:47,667
{\an8}Believe it or not, I was
in a similar situation a few years ago,

59
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:50,461
{\an8}except in that instance,
"Michael" was Javier Bardem,

60
00:02:50,545 --> 00:02:53,006
{\an8}and The Bad Place
was Vanessa Redgrave's panic room.

61
00:02:53,089 --> 00:02:56,092
{\an8}Okay, stop talking.
Do not talk again for 100 hours.

62
00:02:56,175 --> 00:02:58,928
{\an8}-What do we do?
-We team up with Michael.

63
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:02,849
{\an8}Okay. Hot take,
but I like your confidence. Tell me why.

64
00:03:02,932 --> 00:03:04,726
{\an8}He has a bow tie.

65
00:03:04,809 --> 00:03:07,312
{\an8}-Oh, no.
-I always trust dudes in bow ties.

66
00:03:07,395 --> 00:03:11,357
{\an8}Once, a guy in a bow tie came up to me
at the Jacksonville bus station gun range,

67
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:15,945
{\an8}and said he'd give me $600 if I put
these weird turtles in my duffel bag,

68
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:17,405
{\an8}and brought them to Daytona Beach.

69
00:03:17,488 --> 00:03:22,368
{\an8}So, I hotwired a swamp boat to Daytona
and the guy paid me the $600.

70
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:26,372
{\an8}My point is
you always trust dudes in bow ties.

71
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:29,584
{\an8}[Jason grunts and exclaims]

72
00:03:29,667 --> 00:03:32,128
{\an8}Look, Michael's a liar.
I know liars.

73
00:03:32,211 --> 00:03:34,797
{\an8}It was my job
to trick people into buying fake medicine

74
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:37,008
{\an8}and I was the top salesperson
seven years in a row.

75
00:03:37,091 --> 00:03:38,676
{\an8}I thought you only worked there
five years.

76
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:42,430
{\an8}Proves my point. This is a trick.
There's no way we trust him.

77
00:03:42,513 --> 00:03:44,724
{\an8}I agree.
He could be lying about this whole thing.

78
00:03:44,807 --> 00:03:46,684
{\an8}For all we know,
you three are in The Bad Place

79
00:03:46,768 --> 00:03:49,354
and I'm up in the Good Place
where I belong, being tested.

80
00:03:49,437 --> 00:03:52,815
-How would that even--
-I don't know, but it's possible!

81
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:55,985
Before we do anything,
we need more information.

82
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:58,279
We should ask him
every question we can think of.

83
00:03:58,363 --> 00:03:59,197
-Yes.
-[Tahani] Yes.

84
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,407
We'll grill him
like the flank of an Iberian piglet.

85
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:03,534
I'm sorry, has it been 100 hours?

86
00:04:06,871 --> 00:04:11,376
Okay, man. We got questions. First off,
how can we possibly trust you?

87
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:13,586
You can't, but you have to.

88
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:15,755
Logically, you shouldn't,
but you have no choice.

89
00:04:15,838 --> 00:04:19,509
I mean, I wouldn't if I were you.
It's a crazy thing to do. But you gotta.

90
00:04:19,592 --> 00:04:20,718
What happens if we don't?

91
00:04:20,802 --> 00:04:24,722
Most likely, I reboot you once more,
you figure it out again,

92
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:27,850
Vicky tells my boss,
he shuts everything down,

93
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:29,477
I get punished,

94
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:33,481
you end up spending the rest of eternity
in the real Bad Place,

95
00:04:33,564 --> 00:04:36,359
up to your necks
in a volcano full of scorpions.

96
00:04:36,442 --> 00:04:39,821
I'll tell you what I wanna know now
before going further.

97
00:04:39,904 --> 00:04:43,074
Did the Jacksonville Jaguars win
the Super Bowl last year?

98
00:04:43,157 --> 00:04:44,367
[chuckles]

99
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:46,327
[Michael] Oh.

100
00:04:46,411 --> 00:04:47,870
You're serious. Uh, no.

101
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:52,166
-Will they ever win the Super Bowl?
-Jason, I can't predict the future.

102
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:53,918
But no. [chuckles] They won't.

103
00:04:54,002 --> 00:04:57,005
-I have 12 more Jaguars questions--
-No, you don't.

104
00:04:57,088 --> 00:04:58,214
-Hey, Janet.
-Hi, there.

105
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:00,758
Do you have something shiny
Jason can play with?

106
00:05:01,843 --> 00:05:02,719
[gasps]

107
00:05:03,928 --> 00:05:05,888
How many different versions of this place
have we been through?

108
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:07,140
[Jason exclaiming]

109
00:05:07,223 --> 00:05:08,099
Uh, let's see.

110
00:05:08,182 --> 00:05:11,769
Eight hundred and two.
The longest was 11 months.

111
00:05:11,853 --> 00:05:15,023
Uh, this current one
has only been going for one week.

112
00:05:15,106 --> 00:05:18,234
You guys barely know each other.
That's gonna make this tough.

113
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:19,861
What's that super-tiny line?

114
00:05:19,944 --> 00:05:22,238
[Michael] That's the shortest one.
Eight seconds.

115
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:26,034
It was a butt-reboot.
I sat on the activator by mistake.

116
00:05:26,117 --> 00:05:28,369
Michael, was I also rebooted 802 times?

117
00:05:28,453 --> 00:05:30,413
Yes. [sighs] Why?

118
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:32,290
Every time a Janet is rebooted,

119
00:05:32,373 --> 00:05:35,877
she increases
her social awareness and abilities.

120
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:38,379
I might be the most advanced Janet
in the universe.

121
00:05:38,463 --> 00:05:39,297
Oh.

122
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:42,800
So, Janet isn't with you?

123
00:05:42,884 --> 00:05:46,929
No. There has to be a Janet
in every neighborhood, good and bad.

124
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:51,142
This one is an actual Good Place Janet
that I stole to help sell the ruse.

125
00:05:51,225 --> 00:05:54,103
I guess it didn't work, though,
because you keep failing.

126
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:56,022
-Yes. Thank you.
-You're welcome.

127
00:05:56,105 --> 00:05:58,858
If you're not human,
why do you look like us?

128
00:05:58,941 --> 00:06:01,944
Everyone in
the Bad Place Bureau of Human Affairs

129
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:04,781
gets randomly assigned a human body

130
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:08,117
so we can get the feel
of how best to torture you.

131
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:11,537
I gotta say, it took me a long time
to get used to the hanging bits.

132
00:06:11,621 --> 00:06:12,705
Gross.

133
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:14,373
Oh, get your mind out of the gutter,
Eleanor.

134
00:06:14,457 --> 00:06:16,125
I was talking about my testicles.

135
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:18,795
Mindy St. Claire's is fake, I bet.

136
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:20,046
No, the Medium Place is real.

137
00:06:20,129 --> 00:06:24,092
So annoying how you managed
to slip away from me all those times.

138
00:06:24,175 --> 00:06:28,638
Why even tell us about any real thing?
Why not just lie about all of it?

139
00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:31,599
Lies are more convincing
when they're close to the truth.

140
00:06:31,682 --> 00:06:35,228
That's true. I crashed a lot of
open-bar weddings as Eileen Shelbourne.

141
00:06:35,311 --> 00:06:38,314
Even dated a groomsman for a few months,
so I had to keep the name,

142
00:06:38,397 --> 00:06:41,234
and he got "Eileen" tattooed on his neck.

143
00:06:41,317 --> 00:06:42,235
Seriously?

144
00:06:42,318 --> 00:06:45,029
-How is she and I in the same place?
-Oh, get over yourself.

145
00:06:45,113 --> 00:06:47,782
Trust me, don't trust me,
it doesn't matter.

146
00:06:47,865 --> 00:06:50,660
We're running out of time
and I'm your only option.

147
00:06:50,743 --> 00:06:54,747
"We're running out of time
and I'm your only option?"

148
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:59,502
A lot of guys your age said that to me
just as the bar was about to close.

149
00:06:59,585 --> 00:07:00,795
But I never settled for them.

150
00:07:00,878 --> 00:07:04,298
Because my ex-boyfriend lived nearby,
was obsessed with me,

151
00:07:04,382 --> 00:07:06,884
and never slept
because he was addicted to Adderall.

152
00:07:06,968 --> 00:07:09,762
There is always another option.

153
00:07:09,846 --> 00:07:12,181
You guys do whatever you want. I'm out.

154
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:16,018
No! My plan only works
if all four of you are on board.

155
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:18,729
Then you better get cracking
on a new plan, pally,

156
00:07:18,813 --> 00:07:22,483
because I haven't heard
one good reason why I should help you.

157
00:07:22,567 --> 00:07:23,568
How about this?

158
00:07:23,651 --> 00:07:27,029
You help me trick Vicky
and all those other goons...

159
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:30,825
I can get you to the real Good Place.

160
00:07:35,496 --> 00:07:37,832
There's a way
to get to the real Good Place?

161
00:07:37,915 --> 00:07:38,958
It's complicated.

162
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:40,835
It may take a while to arrange,

163
00:07:40,918 --> 00:07:42,670
especially since I'll have to
do it in secret,

164
00:07:42,753 --> 00:07:47,133
but yes, there is
a potential method of transportation.

165
00:07:47,216 --> 00:07:51,345
Well, is it nice? Is there
a business class? Can I pre-board?

166
00:07:51,429 --> 00:07:52,889
Let's not worry about that now.

167
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:55,641
-I can get us there.
-"Us"?

168
00:07:55,725 --> 00:08:00,688
You, Mr. Diabolical Torture Guy, are gonna
try to join us in the Good Place?

169
00:08:00,771 --> 00:08:03,774
Yeah. If I stay in the Bad Place,
I'm doomed.

170
00:08:03,858 --> 00:08:06,319
But if I rescue four...

171
00:08:06,402 --> 00:08:09,697
pitiful, foul-smelling humans
from eternal damnation,

172
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:11,949
hit 'em with the big puppy-dog eyes,

173
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:16,245
"Please, sir, take pity on me,
I've changed," and all that crap...

174
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:17,997
maybe I can earn a spot too.

175
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,708
We didn't deserve the Good Place
based on our time on Earth.

176
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:23,711
-Will they let us stay?
-Honestly, I have no idea.

177
00:08:23,794 --> 00:08:25,922
But if you help me fool Vicky,

178
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:29,133
at least your brains don't get erased
every two weeks.

179
00:08:32,094 --> 00:08:35,223
Okay, all humans who have not
already been suckered by Michael,

180
00:08:35,306 --> 00:08:36,974
another team meeting.

181
00:08:37,058 --> 00:08:38,851
<i>This is definitely a trap.</i>

182
00:08:38,935 --> 00:08:41,103
We figured out his game every time,

183
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:43,356
and now he's trying a new way
to mess with us.

184
00:08:43,439 --> 00:08:46,067
Teaming up with a demon is insane.

185
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:49,111
Maybe.
But I think we have to do it.

186
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:50,863
Are you forking kidding me right now?

187
00:08:50,947 --> 00:08:52,865
You take half an hour
to pick out a turtleneck,

188
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:54,408
-and this you're sure about?
-Look...

189
00:08:54,492 --> 00:08:56,494
I spent my whole life
trying to learn about right and wrong,

190
00:08:56,577 --> 00:08:58,955
and, apparently, I failed.

191
00:08:59,038 --> 00:09:01,499
I want us to get better and stay that way.

192
00:09:01,582 --> 00:09:04,961
-You understand, right, Tahani?
-I understand nothing.

193
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:07,129
Hey, same here.

194
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:08,422
Michael, there's been a mistake.

195
00:09:08,506 --> 00:09:12,009
I belong in the Good Place,
the real one, with good people.

196
00:09:12,093 --> 00:09:14,887
-Who do I speak to about correcting this?
-Me and you're wrong.

197
00:09:14,971 --> 00:09:17,682
Very well.
I want to speak to your manager.

198
00:09:17,765 --> 00:09:19,475
Listen, sweetheart.

199
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:22,520
You've only been in this timeline
for about a week.

200
00:09:22,603 --> 00:09:24,897
So, I'll fast-forward things a bit.

201
00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:27,817
There's a very good reason
why you ended up here.

202
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:30,861
You never cared about
the people you helped.

203
00:09:30,945 --> 00:09:35,241
You did it only for fame or status
or to spite your family.

204
00:09:35,324 --> 00:09:36,826
That is utter tosh!

205
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:40,871
I had my flaws like anyone else,
but I raised billions for charity.

206
00:09:40,955 --> 00:09:44,834
I was a good person,
and I defy you to prove otherwise.

207
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:48,838
[inhales sharply] In all the reboots,
I never showed you how you died.

208
00:09:48,921 --> 00:09:52,508
I was saving it in case I ever needed
to really make you miserable.

209
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:54,468
But it's hilarious.

210
00:09:54,552 --> 00:09:56,053
Of course, I mean, sad.

211
00:09:56,137 --> 00:09:59,307
It might help you come to grips
with who you were.

212
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:01,267
Do you want to remember it?

213
00:10:03,227 --> 00:10:04,270
[sighs]

214
00:10:04,353 --> 00:10:05,605
Tahani Al-Jamil.

215
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:08,774
Social activist,
philanthropist, neck model,

216
00:10:08,858 --> 00:10:11,444
and now, cover girl
for <i>International Sophisticate</i> Magazine.

217
00:10:11,527 --> 00:10:14,155
-Tahani, welcome.
-Oh, it's such an honor.

218
00:10:14,238 --> 00:10:18,284
I have long dreamed of being one of
the women who grace your cover.

219
00:10:18,367 --> 00:10:19,994
Let's begin with your sister, Kamilah.

220
00:10:20,077 --> 00:10:23,497
A woman who, as you know, was offered
the cover, but turned it down.

221
00:10:23,581 --> 00:10:27,376
[chuckles softly]
I actually didn't know that.

222
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:28,919
Please carry on.

223
00:10:29,003 --> 00:10:30,880
Next week,
Kamilah will travel to Cleveland, Ohio,

224
00:10:30,963 --> 00:10:32,548
to become the youngest person
ever inducted

225
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:34,467
into the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame.

226
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:35,885
Remarkable. [sighs]

227
00:10:36,677 --> 00:10:37,511
Is there a question?

228
00:10:38,387 --> 00:10:39,680
Don't you find that remarkable?

229
00:10:40,598 --> 00:10:42,892
Kamilah is very impressive.

230
00:10:42,975 --> 00:10:45,895
As you know, she released
her debut album only six months ago.

231
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:48,230
Yet the critics thought it so brilliant

232
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:51,942
the Hall of Fame decided to waive
its 25-year waiting period.

233
00:10:52,026 --> 00:10:54,779
Sadly, I will not be attending
the ceremony

234
00:10:54,862 --> 00:10:58,324
'cause I will be in Haiti
on a relief mission.

235
00:10:58,407 --> 00:11:01,118
-Perhaps we should talk more about that.
-Perhaps we should.

236
00:11:01,202 --> 00:11:03,204
First, another question about Kamilah.

237
00:11:03,287 --> 00:11:06,874
Don't you think she and I'd be friends?
We have a lot in common.

238
00:11:06,957 --> 00:11:09,293
We're both Capricorn,
and we're both only children.

239
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:14,298
I'm sorry. I forgot about you.
[chuckles]

240
00:11:14,882 --> 00:11:17,927
-[upbeat music playing]
-[indistinct chatter and laughter]

241
00:11:28,396 --> 00:11:33,150
Kamilah! Congratulations.
You have all the attention, once again.

242
00:11:33,234 --> 00:11:34,402
Who are you?

243
00:11:35,069 --> 00:11:35,903
Really?

244
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:42,326
Good Lord. Tahani!
You're a cocktail waitress now. [chuckles]

245
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:44,245
This is the right move for you.

246
00:11:44,328 --> 00:11:47,039
No. It's just that
my sister didn't even deign

247
00:11:47,123 --> 00:11:48,707
to invite me to her little soiree,

248
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:53,045
so I had to weasel my way in here
like some common weasel.

249
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:56,257
I was supposed to be in Haiti
being photographed helping people,

250
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:59,385
but, instead, I delayed my trip by a day
to come here and tell you off.

251
00:11:59,468 --> 00:12:03,931
No, you came to do what you always do,
make a scene and embarrass yourself.

252
00:12:04,014 --> 00:12:07,309
I'm an embarrassment to you?
Is that what you think of me?

253
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:09,228
Honestly?

254
00:12:09,311 --> 00:12:10,729
I don't think about you.

255
00:12:10,813 --> 00:12:12,356
[laughter]

256
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:22,241
No! Ow.

257
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:25,202
-[grunts]
-[people laughing]

258
00:12:26,328 --> 00:12:27,746
[grunts] I will bring you down!

259
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:34,503
Come on. Come on! Come down to the ground,
where you belong...

260
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:35,838
[screams]

261
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:39,633
-Oh, no.
-Mmm.

262
00:12:39,717 --> 00:12:42,136
I died in Cleveland?

263
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:46,056
I don't think that should be
your biggest takeaway from that story.

264
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:48,184
Is that really all I cared about?

265
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:50,769
Just outshining my sister
and gaining praise and acclaim?

266
00:12:50,853 --> 00:12:54,690
'Cause, I mean,
I did gain praise and acclaim.

267
00:12:54,773 --> 00:12:56,484
[chuckles softly] I dare say, on occasion,

268
00:12:56,567 --> 00:13:01,280
more praise and acclaim
than my sister, Kamilah, so...

269
00:13:02,698 --> 00:13:03,991
Oh.

270
00:13:05,409 --> 00:13:06,702
Oh, I see.

271
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:08,954
[whimpering] Oh, God.

272
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:11,499
Oh, come on, now. It's not all bad.

273
00:13:11,582 --> 00:13:15,002
Imagine you're me,
and you're designing a torture chamber

274
00:13:15,085 --> 00:13:18,088
for people who think
they belong in the Good Place.

275
00:13:18,172 --> 00:13:21,217
I mean, you were perfect.

276
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,636
Well, I've always wanted
to be perfect at something.

277
00:13:23,719 --> 00:13:26,096
I never thought
it would be the perfect stooge.

278
00:13:27,681 --> 00:13:31,352
I want to do it. I want to become
the person I pretended to be.

279
00:13:31,435 --> 00:13:33,229
I agree with Chidi.
We should team up with Michael,

280
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:35,439
and all try to build a better Tahani.

281
00:13:35,523 --> 00:13:38,901
Great. Yet again,
it's everyone against Eleanor

282
00:13:38,984 --> 00:13:41,487
because everyone except Eleanor
is an idiot.

283
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:44,323
Why am I the only person
who clearly sees what's going on here?

284
00:13:44,406 --> 00:13:45,699
It's not that
we don't understand the risks.

285
00:13:45,783 --> 00:13:48,953
We want to become better people
and this is our best chance.

286
00:13:49,036 --> 00:13:50,120
Oh, I get it.

287
00:13:50,204 --> 00:13:52,623
'Cause you're so much better than me.

288
00:13:52,706 --> 00:13:54,792
-That's what this is about.
-Hang on, don't lash out at us

289
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:56,544
-just because of your innate distrust...
-"Lash out"?

290
00:13:56,627 --> 00:13:58,420
-No, it's not about who's better...
-[all arguing]

291
00:13:58,504 --> 00:14:03,634
I have no idea what's going on
but everyone is talking and I should too.

292
00:14:03,717 --> 00:14:05,636
-[laughing]
-[yells] What is so funny?

293
00:14:05,719 --> 00:14:07,846
I'm sorry, I shouldn't be laughing.

294
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:09,056
How do I explain this?

295
00:14:09,139 --> 00:14:13,978
I'm basically an exterminator
and you're cockroaches.

296
00:14:14,562 --> 00:14:18,941
My job was to squish you
and poison you, and yet,

297
00:14:19,024 --> 00:14:25,155
somehow, my very survival now depends on
you, the cockroaches, agreeing to help me.

298
00:14:25,239 --> 00:14:26,115
That's funny.

299
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:28,325
-We're cockroaches to you?
-[Michael] Yeah.

300
00:14:28,909 --> 00:14:30,411
Or dung beetles.

301
00:14:30,494 --> 00:14:32,997
I don't know, something small and gross

302
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:35,165
that creeps on the ground
in its own filth.

303
00:14:35,749 --> 00:14:36,876
Just being honest.

304
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:39,086
-Oh! [laughing]
-Okay. Okay. Okay.

305
00:14:39,169 --> 00:14:41,922
-Oh!
-All right. Forget about him. Focus on us.

306
00:14:42,006 --> 00:14:44,842
Kant wrote,
"It is our duty to improve ourselves."

307
00:14:44,925 --> 00:14:47,052
So, whatever Michael's reasons
for doing this,

308
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:50,097
he's giving us the best chance
to improve ourselves.

309
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:51,599
[Eleanor sighs]

310
00:14:51,682 --> 00:14:57,021
I admit you're making a lot of sense.
I need to just untangle all of this.

311
00:14:58,022 --> 00:15:00,900
Give me a minute to think about it alone.

312
00:15:00,983 --> 00:15:02,568
Okay.

313
00:15:02,651 --> 00:15:03,944
[door chiming]

314
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:09,074
-[whispers] Janet?
-Hi, there.

315
00:15:09,158 --> 00:15:11,952
Call me a train.
Fill it to the brim with cocaine.

316
00:15:12,995 --> 00:15:15,915
I'm going back
to Mindy St. Claire's house.

317
00:15:21,545 --> 00:15:22,588
Gonna bail, huh?

318
00:15:23,172 --> 00:15:24,715
Hmm? No.

319
00:15:25,716 --> 00:15:27,092
[stutters] Why would you say that?

320
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:29,261
Well, you got a bag full of clothes,

321
00:15:29,345 --> 00:15:33,390
you stuffed pillows and a mop in your bed
to make it look like you're asleep,

322
00:15:33,474 --> 00:15:35,893
and you're sneaking out the back gate.

323
00:15:35,976 --> 00:15:38,228
Okay. I'm going to Mindy's.

324
00:15:38,312 --> 00:15:42,942
I don't want to live forever in a boring
beige house, with a weird, horny cokehead,

325
00:15:43,025 --> 00:15:44,693
but look at what you're asking me to do.

326
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:49,782
Make a deal with an actual devil
so I can then do homework in secret.

327
00:15:49,865 --> 00:15:53,994
By the way, you're not my friends, man.
We've known each other for a week.

328
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:55,204
You know it's more than that.

329
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:58,958
We've been through some version of this
800 different times.

330
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:01,293
Who cares that it's only been a week?

331
00:16:01,377 --> 00:16:04,296
How long do you have to know someone
before you do the right thing?

332
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:06,382
-Nine weeks! Minimum.
-[chuckles]

333
00:16:06,465 --> 00:16:07,549
Okay.

334
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:12,304
Look, bro, I don't owe you anything.
I gotta do what's right for me.

335
00:16:13,889 --> 00:16:17,101
Come with me if you want.
I got another mop we can put in the bed.

336
00:16:18,102 --> 00:16:19,269
Good luck.

337
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:31,907
[sighs] I got a couple more questions.

338
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:35,703
Sure, take your time.
We're not in a hurry or anything.

339
00:16:35,786 --> 00:16:37,621
How many times, in all the reboots,

340
00:16:37,705 --> 00:16:40,749
did I ask Chidi for help,
he refused to help me,

341
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:44,044
-and I had to get better on my own?
-Never. He always helped you.

342
00:16:44,128 --> 00:16:45,671
[scoffs]

343
00:16:45,754 --> 00:16:47,214
-Really?
-Yep.

344
00:16:47,297 --> 00:16:49,091
No matter how I set it up,

345
00:16:49,174 --> 00:16:51,635
you found him,
confessed you didn't belong,

346
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:53,929
asked him for help, he said yes.

347
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:56,807
Now, his agreeing to help
was part of my plan,

348
00:16:56,890 --> 00:17:00,978
what wasn't part of my plan
was it actually working.

349
00:17:01,061 --> 00:17:02,396
Drove me nuts.

350
00:17:02,479 --> 00:17:04,773
Pesky little nerd stuck with you,

351
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:07,985
and always helped you
overcome your biggest problem.

352
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:10,863
Assuming that's my selfishness?

353
00:17:10,946 --> 00:17:12,489
No. No, no, no.

354
00:17:12,573 --> 00:17:16,368
It's that you never found a haircut
that framed your face properly.

355
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:20,664
-Yes, your selfishness.
-I'm not that selfish.

356
00:17:20,748 --> 00:17:23,584
-Your cocaine and escape train are ready.
-Not now.

357
00:17:23,667 --> 00:17:24,918
Okay.

358
00:17:29,131 --> 00:17:30,758
I think Michael is a liar.

359
00:17:30,841 --> 00:17:33,343
There's a 99% chance he's forking with us.

360
00:17:33,427 --> 00:17:36,889
But he's asking us for help,
so we should help him.

361
00:17:36,972 --> 00:17:38,807
Because that's what Chidi would do.

362
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:41,935
That's what Chidi would do for me,
or for any of us.

363
00:17:42,019 --> 00:17:44,980
-It's what I am doing.
-I know.

364
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:47,649
You're talking about me
like I'm not here or something

365
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:50,194
and that just makes me feel weird.

366
00:17:50,277 --> 00:17:51,278
[sighs]

367
00:17:51,361 --> 00:17:54,281
All right.
We're all in. We'll help you.

368
00:17:54,865 --> 00:17:56,408
You finally listened to reason.

369
00:17:56,492 --> 00:17:58,118
On one condition.

370
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:02,831
You want to be on our team,
you got to be on our team.

371
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:04,958
Which means the professor over here

372
00:18:05,042 --> 00:18:08,045
is gonna give us all lessons
on how to be better people,

373
00:18:08,128 --> 00:18:09,671
including you.

374
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:13,926
Oh. [chuckles] No.
No, I won't be taking any classes.

375
00:18:14,009 --> 00:18:18,472
I'm an immortal being
with abilities you can only dream of--

376
00:18:18,555 --> 00:18:25,062
Yeah, and we're an Arizona dirtbag,
a human turtleneck, a narcissistic monster

377
00:18:25,145 --> 00:18:28,482
and literally the dumbest person
I have ever met.

378
00:18:28,565 --> 00:18:30,859
And who am I? Describe me now.

379
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:35,030
We are all going to take classes.
We are all going to improve.

380
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:37,116
And the second you betray us,

381
00:18:37,199 --> 00:18:39,368
I walk into Vicky's
stinky chowder restaurant,

382
00:18:39,451 --> 00:18:40,702
and tell her everything.

383
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:45,833
You agree to those terms
and you can join us on Team Cockroach.

384
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:47,960
So, what's it gonna be?

385
00:18:48,043 --> 00:18:51,839
You're running out of time.
And we're your only option.

386
00:18:52,673 --> 00:18:53,799
[chuckles softly]

387
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:59,138
-It's all frozen yogurt places now, huh?
-Yeah. Yogurt was what we started with.

388
00:18:59,221 --> 00:19:02,599
A lot of us liked the first version best,
so we went back to

389
00:19:02,683 --> 00:19:07,020
322 perfectly matched human souls,

390
00:19:07,104 --> 00:19:10,691
blended together
in a blissful, harmonic balance.

391
00:19:10,774 --> 00:19:12,526
-[blows raspberries]
-Well done.

392
00:19:12,609 --> 00:19:16,155
I've only given this opening day tour
to you 800 times.

393
00:19:16,238 --> 00:19:19,491
Hey, how's this for
my "Oh, my God, I'm in Heaven" face?

394
00:19:20,492 --> 00:19:21,326
Not bad.

395
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:23,370
Right? I'm a pretty good liar.

396
00:19:23,453 --> 00:19:24,580
[applause]

397
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:27,916
Now, I want to introduce someone
you'll get to know very well.

398
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,418
She was the top point-getter,

399
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:32,838
so she'll help me around
the neighborhood, like your mayor.

400
00:19:32,921 --> 00:19:35,299
Vicky Sengupta!

401
00:19:35,382 --> 00:19:36,633
[applause]

402
00:19:36,717 --> 00:19:38,177
Vicky, would you like to say a few words?

403
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:41,680
Actually, Michael,
I'd like to sing a few words.

404
00:19:41,763 --> 00:19:43,015
Janet, hit it.

405
00:19:43,098 --> 00:19:44,391
[piano playing]

406
00:19:46,894 --> 00:19:50,355
<i>♪ At first I was afraid</i>
<i>I was petrified ♪</i>

407
00:19:50,439 --> 00:19:54,443
<i>♪ Kept thinking I could never live</i>
<i>without you by my side... ♪</i>

408
00:19:55,527 --> 00:19:58,113
We should have a few hours to ourselves.

409
00:19:58,197 --> 00:20:01,658
Vicky's working on her performance
for the welcome party.

410
00:20:01,742 --> 00:20:05,120
It looks like pretending to enjoy
her singing will be half our job here.

411
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:07,789
She told me how she was gonna
torture you at the party,

412
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:10,250
which is basically the same way I did.

413
00:20:10,334 --> 00:20:15,756
Eleanor gets drunk, hogs all the shrimp,
insults people, et cetera.

414
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:20,469
Whatever bad stuff you do becomes
the basis for the chaos tomorrow morning.

415
00:20:20,552 --> 00:20:24,223
Okay, okay. So, my job
is to get drunk and insult people.

416
00:20:24,306 --> 00:20:25,307
I can hack that.

417
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:29,978
Now, Chidi, I'll need you to
act nervous and embarrassed by Eleanor.

418
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:31,146
Way ahead of you.

419
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:33,440
Tahani, just be your fabulous self,

420
00:20:33,523 --> 00:20:37,277
and, Jason, your good, old,
silent Jianyu the monk.

421
00:20:37,861 --> 00:20:41,573
So, I told Vicky I would handle
the surveillance on the four of you.

422
00:20:41,657 --> 00:20:45,953
That'll let us meet each day
for Chidi's ethics lessons,

423
00:20:46,036 --> 00:20:48,538
which will apparently include me.

424
00:20:48,622 --> 00:20:50,457
Even though that's transparently insane.

425
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:53,961
Cool. And, um, Janet,
you're not gonna rat us out, right?

426
00:20:54,044 --> 00:20:59,383
{\an8}Jason, I've thought about this a lot over
the last one and a third milliseconds.

427
00:20:59,466 --> 00:21:04,012
{\an8}I'm not allowed to lie,
but my purpose is to make humans happy.

428
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:06,556
{\an8}And since you're
the only actual humans here,

429
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:10,060
{\an8}I'm on board for whatever fun
little schemes you guys come up with.

430
00:21:10,143 --> 00:21:12,187
{\an8}Okay. Bring it in. Team huddle.

431
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:16,024
{\an8}The Bad Place is about to be outsmarted

432
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:19,319
{\an8}by a cowardly traitor, four dumdums
and a robot.

433
00:21:19,403 --> 00:21:21,238
{\an8}-Not a robot.
-We can do this.

434
00:21:21,321 --> 00:21:24,449
{\an8}Team Cockroach, on three. One, two, three.

435
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:26,994
-[all] Team Cockroach!
-Bobcats!

436
00:21:27,077 --> 00:21:29,204
-[Eleanor] No.
-I still think that's better.
