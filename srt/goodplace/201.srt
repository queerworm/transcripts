00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:03,920
[Eleanor] <i>Last season on</i> The Good Place...

2
00:00:04,004 --> 00:00:07,549
[Michael] <i>In the afterlife, there's </i>
<i>a Good Place and there's a Bad Place.</i>

3
00:00:07,632 --> 00:00:09,801
-You're in the Good Place.
-[sighs]

4
00:00:09,884 --> 00:00:12,178
Eleanor, you are my soulmate.

5
00:00:12,262 --> 00:00:15,473
Chidi, you'll stand by my side,
no matter what, right?

6
00:00:15,557 --> 00:00:16,766
Of course I will.

7
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:19,436
-I'm not supposed to be here.
-Wait, what?

8
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:22,939
Eleanor, Chidi, I would like you to meet
Tahani and Jianyu.

9
00:00:24,023 --> 00:00:25,900
-Oh! You booped me.
-I did!

10
00:00:25,984 --> 00:00:28,862
His real name is Jason.
He's a drug-dealing DJ from Florida.

11
00:00:28,945 --> 00:00:29,779
What's up, homie?

12
00:00:29,863 --> 00:00:32,657
The problem in the neighborhood is me.

13
00:00:33,241 --> 00:00:36,453
You have all done bad things
since you arrived here.

14
00:00:36,536 --> 00:00:39,372
The Bad Place is owed two people.
You can decide.

15
00:00:39,456 --> 00:00:44,586
Holy motherforking shirt balls.

16
00:00:44,669 --> 00:00:46,296
This is the Bad Place.

17
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:47,630
[laughs]

18
00:00:47,714 --> 00:00:51,760
Except for you four, everyone
in this neighborhood is one of us.

19
00:00:51,843 --> 00:00:57,557
You saw us all on Earth:
a selfish ass, an idiot DJ,

20
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:00,727
a tortured academic, a hot, rich fraud.

21
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:03,104
You thought we would torture each other.

22
00:01:03,188 --> 00:01:07,901
The only thing you succeeded in doing
was bringing us all together.

23
00:01:07,984 --> 00:01:10,695
That's it. My big mistake

24
00:01:10,779 --> 00:01:13,823
was having you be soulmates
living next to each other.

25
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:17,494
Next time, I'll spread you out
so it's more of a slow burn.

26
00:01:17,577 --> 00:01:20,538
I'm going to erase your memories,
make a few changes and start over again.

27
00:01:20,622 --> 00:01:22,540
Got to get the boss man to sign off.

28
00:01:22,624 --> 00:01:25,585
If this thing goes sideways again,
you are done.

29
00:01:25,668 --> 00:01:28,630
[Eleanor] <i>Do your worst. We figured </i>
<i>it out once. We can do it again.</i>

30
00:01:28,713 --> 00:01:30,298
Janet, open up.

31
00:01:30,381 --> 00:01:33,968
Because you know what, Michael? Ya basic--

32
00:01:34,385 --> 00:01:38,056
-You, Eleanor Shellstrop, are dead.
-Cool.

33
00:01:38,139 --> 00:01:39,224
I'm your soulmate.

34
00:01:39,307 --> 00:01:41,643
You'll stand by me no matter what, right?

35
00:01:41,726 --> 00:01:44,395
Hold that thought.
Is it okay if I go work out?

36
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:47,357
I gotta stay jacked. It's who I am.

37
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:49,192
See you soon.

38
00:01:49,275 --> 00:01:50,527
-Hi, there.
-[gasps]

39
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:52,695
I'm Janet. I think this is yours.

40
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:55,532
After I was rebooted,
I found it in my mouth.

41
00:01:55,615 --> 00:02:00,245
What the fork is a "Chidi"?
Why can't I say "fork"?

42
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:10,797
Okay, here we go.

43
00:02:11,422 --> 00:02:14,676
Confidence, Mikey. Project confidence.

44
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,470
There he is. How's it goin', boss man?

45
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:20,056
<i>Enough chitchat.</i>
<i>Is everything in place for version two?</i>

46
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:24,394
Yep! We're keeping everything
from version one that made them miserable,

47
00:02:24,477 --> 00:02:27,147
adding a bunch of new stuff
that they'll hate.

48
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:31,526
For example, all the coffee is
from those little pods.

49
00:02:31,609 --> 00:02:34,362
[laughs] Diabolical.

50
00:02:34,946 --> 00:02:38,449
Plus, they will all have new soulmates,
of course.

51
00:02:38,533 --> 00:02:41,327
You gotta trust me on this, boss.
I've thought of everything.

52
00:02:42,328 --> 00:02:43,997
-I won't let you down.
<i>-I think you will.</i>

53
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:47,000
<i>I think this entire project of yours</i>
<i>is stupid and doomed to fail.</i>

54
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:50,003
<i>I think you're going to be retired,</i>
<i>eliminated from existence,</i>

55
00:02:50,086 --> 00:02:51,713
<i>and burned on the surface</i>
<i>of a billion suns.</i>

56
00:02:51,796 --> 00:02:54,549
<i>And I have no doubt that you</i>
<i>and your cockamamie experiment</i>

57
00:02:54,632 --> 00:02:56,676
<i>will go down in history</i>
<i>as colossal failures.</i>

58
00:02:56,759 --> 00:02:58,720
-You know, I think if you--
<i>-Toodle-oo.</i>

59
00:02:59,304 --> 00:03:01,723
[Michael] <i>Okay. Take two, folks.</i>

60
00:03:01,806 --> 00:03:05,184
Any last questions
before we start up again? Yes.

61
00:03:05,268 --> 00:03:08,605
Just so I'm clear,
we're not pairing them up this time?

62
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:13,693
Correct. Obviously, the eventual goal is
to get them to torture each other.

63
00:03:13,776 --> 00:03:17,363
But, first, we're gonna create
some nice, individual torment.

64
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:20,575
In version one, making them soulmates,

65
00:03:20,658 --> 00:03:23,953
we probably bit off
more than we could chew.

66
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:26,956
We could bite them? I didn't know
we were allowed to bite them.

67
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,083
That's an expression, Chuck.

68
00:03:29,167 --> 00:03:30,376
Go ahead, Vicky.

69
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:32,712
I have some questions
about my new character.

70
00:03:32,795 --> 00:03:37,926
I feel like I got "real" Eleanor.
Like, I got her, you know?

71
00:03:38,009 --> 00:03:42,639
But this new character, Denise.
I mean, who is she? I don't get her.

72
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:45,141
Is she a quirky best friend type,

73
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:48,811
or more of a "femme fatale,
sexuality is her weapon of choice" type?

74
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:50,396
Both those things.

75
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,149
I have some questions
about my character, too.

76
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:55,026
Like... can he bite them?

77
00:03:55,109 --> 00:03:58,738
No. Okay, reminder,
the most important thing tonight,

78
00:03:58,821 --> 00:04:00,031
and this is crucial,

79
00:04:00,114 --> 00:04:03,660
you need to get Eleanor drunk
at the welcome party

80
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:06,996
so she will say and do
a bunch of bad stuff.

81
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,623
Then, we take that stuff

82
00:04:08,706 --> 00:04:12,710
and use it to build
our chaos sequence in the morning.

83
00:04:12,794 --> 00:04:16,673
For example, you remember last time,
she stole all the cocktail shrimp,

84
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:20,635
<i>and we made giant nightmare shrimp</i>
<i>fly through the sky?</i>

85
00:04:20,718 --> 00:04:21,552
[all laugh]

86
00:04:21,636 --> 00:04:24,222
See, it's those details
that make her realize

87
00:04:24,305 --> 00:04:26,557
she's in danger of being found out.

88
00:04:27,475 --> 00:04:32,939
Okay, all right, I know
that this kind of large-scale deception

89
00:04:33,022 --> 00:04:35,108
is not what you were trained to do.

90
00:04:35,191 --> 00:04:37,694
There are gonna be days
when you are just sick

91
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:43,866
of being around these disgusting humans,
with their weird, gross little mouths

92
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:46,286
and their stupid elbows.

93
00:04:46,369 --> 00:04:51,374
You're gonna be tempted to say,
"Screw it. Can't we just go back to HQ,

94
00:04:51,457 --> 00:04:53,459
and do this the old-fashioned way?

95
00:04:53,543 --> 00:04:54,794
Pull out some fingernails,

96
00:04:54,877 --> 00:04:58,506
toss someone in an acid pit,
fire up the old penis flattener?"

97
00:04:58,589 --> 00:05:04,387
And sure, that sounds nice,
but it also sounds easy.

98
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:08,308
We're all here because we believe
that there's a better way

99
00:05:08,391 --> 00:05:13,938
to make humans miserable.
And I... I believe in you.

100
00:05:14,897 --> 00:05:19,444
So, torture on three. Ready?
One, two, three...

101
00:05:19,527 --> 00:05:20,862
[all] Torture!

102
00:05:20,945 --> 00:05:21,904
And biting!

103
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:23,489
Nope! No.

104
00:05:23,573 --> 00:05:25,575
[theme music playing]

105
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:35,543
{\an8}Hey, lady? Can you come back?

106
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:37,879
{\an8}Joey?

107
00:05:38,796 --> 00:05:40,339
{\an8}Janine?

108
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:44,177
{\an8}[stammers] Jaja?

109
00:05:45,303 --> 00:05:47,930
{\an8}Why don't I ever listen to people
when they talk about themselves?

110
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:50,391
{\an8}No, it's annoying, and I'm right not to.

111
00:05:50,475 --> 00:05:54,854
{\an8}Okay, Chidi, where are you?
Or what are you?

112
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:57,940
{\an8}A type of soup, maybe?

113
00:05:58,024 --> 00:05:59,984
{\an8}[indistinct conversation]

114
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:04,530
Hi, there. I'm Eleanor.

115
00:06:04,614 --> 00:06:08,659
{\an8}Nice to meet you, Eleanor.
I'm Nina, this is my soulmate, Bart.

116
00:06:08,743 --> 00:06:13,664
{\an8}Love it! Love people's names,
and love learning all about them.

117
00:06:13,748 --> 00:06:14,624
{\an8}Where are you all from?

118
00:06:14,707 --> 00:06:17,543
{\an8}Well, oddly enough,
I was born in Mozambique--

119
00:06:17,627 --> 00:06:21,506
{\an8}Cool. Listen, do you guys know if
there's a neighborhood phone book

120
00:06:21,589 --> 00:06:23,049
{\an8}with everybody's name listed in it?

121
00:06:23,132 --> 00:06:26,552
{\an8}Oh, I don't think so,
'cause there's no phones here.

122
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:28,262
{\an8}There are no phones here?

123
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:31,974
{\an8}-Of course. Duh!
-[both chuckle]

124
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:33,184
{\an8}There's no use for 'em.

125
00:06:33,267 --> 00:06:35,436
{\an8}I always prefer talking to people, anyway.

126
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:39,524
{\an8}People are like nature's apps.

127
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:42,485
Hmm. Anyway,

128
00:06:42,568 --> 00:06:44,487
we're on our way to get some pizza.
Would you like to join us?

129
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:46,823
Maybe we could get know each other
a little bit, chat.

130
00:06:46,906 --> 00:06:48,616
Uh, I'm good.
I'm gonna explore a little bit,

131
00:06:48,699 --> 00:06:51,202
but it was so nice
to meet you, Nina, and--

132
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,122
Bye-bye.

133
00:06:57,959 --> 00:06:59,127
Oh, sorry, I didn't see you.

134
00:07:01,546 --> 00:07:03,673
Chidi? Are you Chidi?

135
00:07:08,469 --> 00:07:12,014
-Eleanor? What are you up to?
-Oh! Hey there, Michael.

136
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:15,059
Just getting to know everyone
in the neighborhood.

137
00:07:15,143 --> 00:07:18,396
Who was that mysterious gentleman
wearing the nightgown?

138
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:23,609
Oh, uh, that's Jianyu, a Taiwanese monk
who never speaks.

139
00:07:23,693 --> 00:07:26,195
Might be a little hard
to get to know him. [chuckles]

140
00:07:26,821 --> 00:07:29,699
Eleanor, you and I both know

141
00:07:29,782 --> 00:07:32,869
you're not like everyone else
in this neighborhood.

142
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:36,998
Everyone here led a remarkable life.

143
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:42,962
But you, the work you did
as an environmental activist

144
00:07:43,045 --> 00:07:45,423
was just extraordinary.

145
00:07:45,506 --> 00:07:46,883
Uh...

146
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:49,760
Oh, well, it's the environment.

147
00:07:49,844 --> 00:07:52,096
I mean, I loved...

148
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:53,264
mushrooms.

149
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:55,892
I can honestly say that.

150
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:59,937
Well, it paid off because
you were the number one point-getter

151
00:08:00,021 --> 00:08:01,731
in this entire neighborhood.

152
00:08:01,814 --> 00:08:04,942
And as such, I was hoping
you could say a few words

153
00:08:05,026 --> 00:08:08,154
at tonight's welcome party
to introduce yourself?

154
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:10,364
How can I say no? [chuckles]

155
00:08:10,448 --> 00:08:12,700
Can I say no?
It doesn't feel like I can say no.

156
00:08:12,783 --> 00:08:15,077
-But if I can, Michael, I'm saying no.
-Okay.

157
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:19,332
You'll speak for maybe an hour or so?
Hey, you know what?

158
00:08:19,415 --> 00:08:21,584
I got you something to wear here.

159
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:25,171
All the top point-getters wear these
on the first night.

160
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:28,758
Oh, you gotta be forking kidding me.

161
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:32,011
{\an8}So, long story short,
my heart is in the Pope,

162
00:08:32,094 --> 00:08:35,556
{\an8}my liver's in the Dalai Lama,
and my teeth were strung into a necklace

163
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:38,184
for a child king in French Polynesia.

164
00:08:38,267 --> 00:08:41,604
But it got me into the Good Place,
so can't complain.

165
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:45,983
Wow! Can I tell you something,
just soulmate to soulmate?

166
00:08:46,067 --> 00:08:48,402
Hold that thought.
I'm gonna head to the gym.

167
00:08:48,486 --> 00:08:50,238
[chuckles]

168
00:08:50,321 --> 00:08:52,907
Are you serious?
Again, right now?

169
00:08:53,616 --> 00:08:55,660
Yeah. I'll catch you later.

170
00:08:56,744 --> 00:08:58,913
Hey, there, Best Person.

171
00:08:58,996 --> 00:09:01,541
{\an8}You must be Eleanor.
I'm Jessica, the host.

172
00:09:01,624 --> 00:09:03,918
-Hi.
-Michael told us about your speech.

173
00:09:04,001 --> 00:09:05,753
I can't wait to hear what you have to say.

174
00:09:05,836 --> 00:09:08,798
Me neither, Jessica. Me neither.

175
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:12,927
Aw, don't be nervous.
Here, liquid courage.

176
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:17,056
Actually, um, you know what?
I think I need to keep a clear head.

177
00:09:17,139 --> 00:09:19,850
Can you imagine getting drunk
before giving a big speech?

178
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:22,603
Getting kicked out
of your niece's christening

179
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:24,438
and then, only later,
once you've sobered up,

180
00:09:24,522 --> 00:09:27,525
realized you don't even have a niece?
It's like, who was that kid?

181
00:09:27,608 --> 00:09:28,859
[chuckles]

182
00:09:28,943 --> 00:09:31,779
So, Eleanor, you were
an environmental lawyer.

183
00:09:31,862 --> 00:09:33,447
-That's fascinating.
-I know.

184
00:09:33,531 --> 00:09:35,241
Just don't ask me questions about it.

185
00:09:35,324 --> 00:09:37,702
I am sick of describing
exactly what it means.

186
00:09:37,785 --> 00:09:40,246
Hey, I'm headed to the bar.
Can I grab you something?

187
00:09:40,329 --> 00:09:42,540
-How about a margarita?
-No, I'm good.

188
00:09:42,623 --> 00:09:45,751
{\an8}Actually, I'm the best.
According to the sash.

189
00:09:48,296 --> 00:09:51,299
-She's still not drinking?
-Nope. Something's off.

190
00:09:51,382 --> 00:09:52,800
Should we...

191
00:09:52,883 --> 00:09:54,218
[chomping]

192
00:09:54,302 --> 00:09:55,219
No.

193
00:09:55,303 --> 00:09:57,221
-Keep it together.
-Yeah.

194
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:04,770
Screw it. Couple of quick shots.

195
00:10:05,354 --> 00:10:07,732
Then I'm coming for you, shrimpies.

196
00:10:12,903 --> 00:10:15,656
[woman] Please don't make this harder
than it already is, Chidi.

197
00:10:20,202 --> 00:10:22,872
These are for you. Drink up.

198
00:10:24,665 --> 00:10:26,709
Hi. Is your name Chidi?

199
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:28,169
Yes?

200
00:10:28,252 --> 00:10:30,296
Ah! I knew you weren't a soup.

201
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:33,257
-What?
-Listen to me carefully.

202
00:10:33,341 --> 00:10:35,384
My name is Eleanor Shellstrop.

203
00:10:36,385 --> 00:10:38,095
We need to talk.

204
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:47,605
Chidi? Come on in.

205
00:10:48,272 --> 00:10:50,024
[Chidi] <i>There really is an afterlife.</i>

206
00:10:50,107 --> 00:10:55,196
I can't wait to have breakfast with Kant,
lunch with Michel Foucault,

207
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:56,405
dinner with Kant again,

208
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:58,240
so we can talk about
what came up at breakfast--

209
00:10:58,324 --> 00:11:02,078
I'm sorry, Chidi,
all the great philosophers in history

210
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:03,746
ended up in the Bad Place.

211
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:06,165
All of my heroes are--

212
00:11:06,248 --> 00:11:08,250
Being tortured. Yes. I'm afraid so.

213
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:13,339
Actually, it is kind of clever
how they punish philosophers.

214
00:11:13,422 --> 00:11:17,343
Every day, they make them
go to school naked.

215
00:11:17,426 --> 00:11:22,056
Then they take a test in a class
they've never been to. [chuckles]

216
00:11:22,139 --> 00:11:25,851
Then they smash them with hammers.
That part is not so clever.

217
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:31,315
But the point is, Chidi,
you were way better than all of them.

218
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:32,608
You're safe.

219
00:11:34,151 --> 00:11:37,988
-No way. Soulmates are real?
-They sure are.

220
00:11:38,072 --> 00:11:41,909
Although, your soulmate situation
is a little unusual.

221
00:11:41,992 --> 00:11:45,746
Oh, no. I don't have one, do I? That's
fine. Who needs a soulmate, anyway?

222
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:49,708
My soulmate will be... books.

223
00:11:49,792 --> 00:11:51,877
No, no. It's not that
you don't have a soulmate.

224
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:54,463
It's that you have multiple soulmates.

225
00:11:55,256 --> 00:12:01,637
Here, now, normally our omniscient system
perfectly analyzes each person's profile

226
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:04,223
and matches him or her
with another person.

227
00:12:04,306 --> 00:12:08,352
But in your case, the system matched you
with two other people.

228
00:12:08,436 --> 00:12:12,022
It's a rare occurrence,
like a double rainbow.

229
00:12:12,106 --> 00:12:14,650
Or someone on the Internet saying,

230
00:12:14,733 --> 00:12:17,695
"You know what?
You've convinced me I was wrong."

231
00:12:17,778 --> 00:12:19,613
So, how do you choose
who I should be with?

232
00:12:19,697 --> 00:12:21,532
I don't choose. You do, Chidi.

233
00:12:21,615 --> 00:12:24,243
I... What?

234
00:12:24,326 --> 00:12:27,705
This is Angélique, Pedro and Pevita.

235
00:12:27,788 --> 00:12:33,377
According to the system, either Pedro
or Chidi could be matched perfectly

236
00:12:33,461 --> 00:12:38,299
with either Angélique or Pevita.
So, figure it out. Should be fun.

237
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:42,344
Cool beans. One second, guys.

238
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:44,430
-So, so-- Yeah.
-Yeah?

239
00:12:44,513 --> 00:12:48,517
So, making decisions
isn't necessarily my strong suit.

240
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:49,643
I know that, buddy.

241
00:12:49,727 --> 00:12:53,022
You once had a panic attack
at a Make Your Own Sundae bar.

242
00:12:53,105 --> 00:12:56,275
There were too many toppings
and very early in the process,

243
00:12:56,358 --> 00:12:58,819
you had to commit to a chocolate palette
or a fruit palette.

244
00:12:58,903 --> 00:13:01,697
If you couldn't decide, you wound up
with kiwi, Junior Mint, raisin,

245
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:03,073
and it ruins everyone's night.

246
00:13:03,157 --> 00:13:07,453
Chidi, I am so sorry.
I literally cannot choose for you.

247
00:13:07,536 --> 00:13:09,914
This has to be your decision.

248
00:13:09,997 --> 00:13:11,874
Buddy, you gotta trust me.

249
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:16,337
I would never place you
in a painful situation.

250
00:13:16,921 --> 00:13:18,797
Great. [clears throat]

251
00:13:18,881 --> 00:13:20,216
You ready, Chidi?

252
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:21,300
[mouthing] Perfect.

253
00:13:21,383 --> 00:13:25,471
Here you go, Chidi. One slice of Hawaiian
straight out the oven for ya.

254
00:13:25,554 --> 00:13:27,556
I'm Denise. Welcome to my pizza place.

255
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:30,643
-Thanks, Denise.
-And here's one for you. Have a nice day.

256
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:34,563
It's interesting
that Hawaiian pizza's so popular here.

257
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:36,899
Yeah, I guess a lot
of the residents love it.

258
00:13:36,982 --> 00:13:40,319
Makes you wonder what type of pizza
they have in the Bad Place, huh?

259
00:13:40,402 --> 00:13:41,570
[both chuckle]

260
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:44,031
So, I can't believe
you studied in Brisbane.

261
00:13:44,114 --> 00:13:46,909
We must've just missed each other.
What was your thesis on?

262
00:13:46,992 --> 00:13:52,373
Oh, gosh. It was so boring. It was called,
"Cultural Relativism and Moral Absolutism:

263
00:13:52,456 --> 00:13:55,793
An Exploration of Values As Seen Through
the Works of Alain LeRoy Locke

264
00:13:55,876 --> 00:13:57,878
-and Immanuel Kant."
-And Immanuel Kant!

265
00:13:57,962 --> 00:13:59,588
Shut up. You read it?

266
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:02,925
No, but that pairing
is the most obvious pairing

267
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:06,679
to employ in a paper with that title,
and I wanna read it so bad.

268
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:08,681
<i>What about Morocco?</i>

269
00:14:08,764 --> 00:14:10,266
You ever travel there?

270
00:14:10,349 --> 00:14:11,809
[clicks tongue]

271
00:14:14,395 --> 00:14:15,479
No.

272
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:19,191
What about anywhere else?
You been anywhere else?

273
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:20,526
No.

274
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:26,031
So, first impressions? Anyone?

275
00:14:26,115 --> 00:14:28,284
I kinda wanna hear what Chidi thinks.

276
00:14:29,326 --> 00:14:34,415
Well, um, I mean, you're both brilliant,
accomplished women,

277
00:14:34,498 --> 00:14:35,499
and Pedro, you're great, too.

278
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:39,003
Just amazing people. I'm surrounded.
[exclaims and chuckles]

279
00:14:39,086 --> 00:14:43,340
But if I had to say who I, sort of,

280
00:14:43,424 --> 00:14:47,428
immediately bonded to on a gut level,

281
00:14:47,511 --> 00:14:50,222
I think I would say that

282
00:14:50,306 --> 00:14:54,351
I kind of feel like
my soulmate is Angélique--

283
00:14:54,435 --> 00:14:57,771
[panting] Wait! Wait!

284
00:14:57,855 --> 00:14:59,732
There was a mistake in the calculations.

285
00:14:59,815 --> 00:15:03,694
We had a four-hour time gap
in your profiles on May 10, 2003.

286
00:15:03,777 --> 00:15:08,407
I corrected that day's events
for all of you, and ran the numbers again.

287
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:13,579
And the final result proves definitively
that Pedro is Angélique's soulmate,

288
00:15:13,662 --> 00:15:16,457
and, Chidi, your soulmate is Pevita.

289
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:18,792
That was close. [chuckles]

290
00:15:20,544 --> 00:15:22,671
Hey. You guys hadn't made
a decision yet, had you?

291
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:24,256
No, we did not.

292
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:26,008
No one said anything,
I didn't hear anything,

293
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:28,844
and I certainly didn't say anything.
That's for darn sure.

294
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:31,972
[both laugh]

295
00:15:37,061 --> 00:15:40,648
Okay. All right. See you later.

296
00:15:43,651 --> 00:15:46,654
This is fun. It's a fun party.

297
00:15:46,737 --> 00:15:49,490
There's no question about it.
This is a fun situation.

298
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:54,328
Hey. You guys are here.
The fun continues, nay, increases.

299
00:15:54,912 --> 00:15:56,705
You two look nice.

300
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:59,166
Thanks. And you look...

301
00:16:01,543 --> 00:16:02,419
fine.

302
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:04,922
Would I say you look
better than anyone else here?

303
00:16:05,005 --> 00:16:07,633
No, I wouldn't say that.
Do you look bad? No.

304
00:16:07,716 --> 00:16:10,970
But good, would I go as far to say is,
you look good? Doubtful.

305
00:16:11,053 --> 00:16:11,887
Hey, wine.

306
00:16:12,888 --> 00:16:14,431
Mmm. Uh...

307
00:16:14,515 --> 00:16:16,100
Do I feel like red or white?

308
00:16:16,684 --> 00:16:20,187
Deep down in your heart of hearts,
you already know which one you want.

309
00:16:22,898 --> 00:16:24,400
Why isn't anyone talking?

310
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:26,276
Janet, could you show me
to the bar, please?

311
00:16:32,741 --> 00:16:37,955
Oh! Hey. Chidi, right? Denise.
We met earlier, remember?

312
00:16:38,539 --> 00:16:42,292
-Oh, yeah. Hi. Are you limping?
-Yeah, I am.

313
00:16:42,376 --> 00:16:43,711
Crazy story.

314
00:16:43,794 --> 00:16:47,131
See, I was a trapeze artist
in an illegal circus in Bangladesh--

315
00:16:47,214 --> 00:16:49,883
-Angélique.
-Hey, how are you doing?

316
00:16:50,884 --> 00:16:53,512
[chuckles] Oh, well, you know...

317
00:16:54,388 --> 00:16:56,849
stomach's in knots,
I'm stress-grinding my teeth,

318
00:16:56,932 --> 00:16:58,976
and it feels like
my soul is being suffocated.

319
00:16:59,059 --> 00:17:02,104
You know, your standard paradise stuff.
How about you?

320
00:17:02,187 --> 00:17:04,690
It's been a little uncomfortable.

321
00:17:04,773 --> 00:17:09,236
I think Pedro maybe heard you say
that thing you were gonna say.

322
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:11,655
Oh, no. I'm so sorry, I...

323
00:17:12,531 --> 00:17:15,325
But I have to ask,
do you feel the way I feel?

324
00:17:15,409 --> 00:17:17,619
-We can't talk about this.
-I know,

325
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:21,498
but if the numbers were that close,
I think I'm supposed to be with--

326
00:17:21,582 --> 00:17:25,252
Stop. Please don't make this harder
than it already is, Chidi.

327
00:17:29,173 --> 00:17:30,049
These are for you.

328
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:33,761
Hi. Is your name Chidi?

329
00:17:34,803 --> 00:17:37,347
-Yes?
-Ah! I knew you weren't a soup!

330
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:40,309
-What?
-Listen to me very carefully.

331
00:17:40,392 --> 00:17:44,438
My name is Eleanor Shellstrop.
We need to talk.

332
00:17:44,521 --> 00:17:46,565
-About what?
-Just shut your mouth,

333
00:17:46,648 --> 00:17:48,567
smile at me and walk over here.

334
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:52,821
Okay, you're definitely
my least favorite person I've met so far.

335
00:17:53,405 --> 00:17:55,074
I'm sorry, this is not a good time.

336
00:17:55,157 --> 00:17:56,116
I'm in the middle of something--

337
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:59,578
Dude, I'm guessing we have about
30 seconds to talk before someone notices.

338
00:17:59,661 --> 00:18:04,083
When I got here, some robot lady appeared
out of thin air and gave me this.

339
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:06,460
-You mean Janet.
-[groans] That's it. Janet.

340
00:18:06,543 --> 00:18:09,046
-Hi, there.
-Not now, Janet. Buzz off.

341
00:18:09,129 --> 00:18:10,130
Okay.

342
00:18:10,214 --> 00:18:14,301
Now, I have no memory of writing this,
but it is my handwriting.

343
00:18:14,885 --> 00:18:16,136
{\an8}That's your name, right?

344
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:18,972
So, for some reason, at some point,

345
00:18:19,056 --> 00:18:23,602
I put this note into...
that whatever-lady's robot mouth.

346
00:18:23,685 --> 00:18:24,937
You already forgot her name.

347
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:29,566
No, I didn't. Her name is Janet.

348
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:31,068
-Hi, there.
-[gasps] Fork off.

349
00:18:31,151 --> 00:18:31,985
Okay.

350
00:18:32,569 --> 00:18:35,489
From the second I got here,
these nerds have been acting real weird,

351
00:18:35,572 --> 00:18:37,157
trying to get me drunk.

352
00:18:37,241 --> 00:18:39,910
My soulmate ditches me every time
I try to talk to him.

353
00:18:39,993 --> 00:18:44,665
And this Zen master guy
gave me this magic bracelet thing.

354
00:18:44,748 --> 00:18:46,416
And then he just ran away.

355
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:50,629
Something very strange is going on here,
and the only person I trust is me.

356
00:18:50,712 --> 00:18:54,341
And me told me to find you.
So, what's the deal?

357
00:18:54,424 --> 00:18:55,425
What's happening? What do you got?

358
00:18:56,927 --> 00:19:02,307
Okay. Look, I'm sorry,
but none of this means anything to me,

359
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:05,144
and I've got my own problems to deal with.
I'm sorry. I can't help you.

360
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:10,649
-Attention, everyone! Speech time.
-[glass chimes]

361
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:14,862
You're probably not a magic wizard
trapped in an amulet.

362
00:19:14,945 --> 00:19:17,906
But if you are,
please get me out of this speech.

363
00:19:26,206 --> 00:19:28,625
Tahani, come on in.

364
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,920
You're in the Good Place, Tahani.

365
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:34,840
[exclaims] What a surprise!

366
00:19:36,258 --> 00:19:38,135
But, yes, I accept.

367
00:19:38,218 --> 00:19:41,054
This is your soulmate, Tomás.

368
00:19:41,138 --> 00:19:44,933
Now, Tomás was a doctor
with the International Rescue Alliance,

369
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:49,188
and you raised money that ultimately
funded his medical mission.

370
00:19:49,271 --> 00:19:51,356
It's just so perfect.

371
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,984
-It's lovely to meet you, Tahani.
-Charmed, I'm...

372
00:19:54,067 --> 00:19:55,277
Short.

373
00:19:56,361 --> 00:19:57,905
I'm sorry, did I just say "short"?

374
00:19:57,988 --> 00:20:02,284
I meant to say, "Charmed, I'm sure."
Because I am charmed to meet you.

375
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:04,620
It's just
an unfortunate Freudian short. [chuckles]

376
00:20:07,289 --> 00:20:08,665
Shall we?

377
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,461
Where did you attend medical short?

378
00:20:12,544 --> 00:20:17,424
So, this is the living room,
as well as the kitchen and the bedroom.

379
00:20:18,133 --> 00:20:20,427
-It's so cozy.
-[chuckles]

380
00:20:21,011 --> 00:20:23,430
I feel like the walls are hugging me.

381
00:20:23,513 --> 00:20:28,060
Michael, I don't mean to be rude,
but this is simply absurd.

382
00:20:28,143 --> 00:20:31,480
Yes. Thank you.
I didn't want to say anything, but--

383
00:20:31,563 --> 00:20:34,483
There's only two of us.
We don't need all this space.

384
00:20:34,566 --> 00:20:35,943
"All this space"?

385
00:20:36,026 --> 00:20:39,780
Of course, you two humanitarians
don't want anything extravagant.

386
00:20:39,863 --> 00:20:41,114
I'll get rid of the second floor.

387
00:20:42,699 --> 00:20:44,868
Okay. I'll let you two
have some alone time.

388
00:20:44,952 --> 00:20:46,328
I'll see you at the party.

389
00:20:49,289 --> 00:20:52,876
Well, it certainly is quite quaint.
It's just...

390
00:20:54,044 --> 00:20:58,590
fun... I dare say, even quite charming...
Oh, no.

391
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:02,678
-What's the matter?
-Sorry, it's just a self-portrait

392
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:04,137
of my sister.

393
00:21:04,972 --> 00:21:05,806
Wonderful.

394
00:21:05,889 --> 00:21:08,100
Your sister is Kamilah Al-Jamil?

395
00:21:08,183 --> 00:21:09,893
I used to play her music for my patients.

396
00:21:09,977 --> 00:21:13,522
At times, it felt like Kamilah's songs
were curing the malaria for us.

397
00:21:14,356 --> 00:21:15,649
Great.

398
00:21:16,817 --> 00:21:19,403
Well, I best be getting changed
for tonight.

399
00:21:19,486 --> 00:21:21,822
I can hardly wear a day dress
to an evening event.

400
00:21:21,905 --> 00:21:24,116
Sounds good.
I'm ready whenever you are.

401
00:21:25,575 --> 00:21:28,453
-Is that what you're wearing?
-Oh, yeah.

402
00:21:28,537 --> 00:21:32,374
My years treating remote villagers
taught me to favor comfort over style.

403
00:21:32,457 --> 00:21:34,835
But you should wear whatever you prefer.

404
00:21:34,918 --> 00:21:38,297
Well, I mean, as we are soulmates,

405
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:40,132
perhaps, I should also...

406
00:21:41,174 --> 00:21:42,843
dress down.

407
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:49,349
You all right, my dear?

408
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:54,146
Yes. Just not used to dressing
like a plumber-ess.

409
00:21:55,105 --> 00:21:58,108
Is that what you call a female plumber,
or is it a toilet sweep?

410
00:21:58,692 --> 00:22:00,277
Or clog wench?

411
00:22:00,777 --> 00:22:03,530
[chuckles] In any case,
that's how I'm dressed.

412
00:22:03,613 --> 00:22:09,911
My darling, you are in the Good Place.
Relax. Feel the breeze on your feet.

413
00:22:10,495 --> 00:22:13,457
That's why Crocs have holes in them.
I'll get us a drink.

414
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:15,375
Lower that beautiful face for me,
won't you?

415
00:22:15,459 --> 00:22:18,837
-Lower, lower, lower, lower, lower...
-Okay.

416
00:22:21,715 --> 00:22:23,008
Tahani, you all right?

417
00:22:23,091 --> 00:22:27,554
Michael, hello.
Yes, I'm having a splendid time.

418
00:22:28,305 --> 00:22:31,975
Although, if I'm being honest,
a few aspects of my day

419
00:22:32,059 --> 00:22:34,311
have been sub-optimal.

420
00:22:34,394 --> 00:22:36,605
Really? Like what?

421
00:22:36,688 --> 00:22:41,068
[sighs] Well, my house is a bit small,
which is fine.

422
00:22:41,151 --> 00:22:45,113
It's just not what I'm used to.
And Tomás is lovely,

423
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:50,077
but we haven't really "clicked" yet,
to use a mundane colloquialism,

424
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:55,248
which I suppose I should do,
now that I'm wearing cargo pants.

425
00:22:55,332 --> 00:22:59,544
Tahani, it's very common
to experience adjustment pains.

426
00:22:59,628 --> 00:23:03,715
But the system matched you and Tomás.
And the system is never wrong.

427
00:23:04,716 --> 00:23:06,760
But guess what? This is the Good Place.

428
00:23:06,843 --> 00:23:09,221
If you want your house to be larger,
then just ask.

429
00:23:09,304 --> 00:23:11,681
Do you want something this big?

430
00:23:11,765 --> 00:23:13,767
Or maybe bigger, like the Taj Mahal.

431
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:16,228
I know, I know. How about a moon?

432
00:23:16,311 --> 00:23:18,522
Would you like to live
on your own private moon?

433
00:23:18,605 --> 00:23:21,900
No. No. No. My house is wonderful.

434
00:23:21,983 --> 00:23:25,403
It's so silly to want
a bigger house, of all things,

435
00:23:25,487 --> 00:23:28,532
here in paradise. So, no.
No changes needed.

436
00:23:28,615 --> 00:23:31,576
Okay.
But if you change your mind, just ask.

437
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:34,246
Because all the other residents
are very happy,

438
00:23:34,329 --> 00:23:38,458
so it'll give me plenty of time
to deal with whatever requests you make.

439
00:23:38,542 --> 00:23:43,338
No demand is too,
what's the word, frivolous. Okay?

440
00:23:43,922 --> 00:23:45,715
Wow. That is rough.

441
00:23:49,928 --> 00:23:52,097
[Angélique] Please don't make this harder
than it already is, Chidi.

442
00:23:56,017 --> 00:23:58,937
These are for you. Drink up.

443
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:02,816
-No, no. I--
-[chuckles] Hey! Twinsies.

444
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:07,070
-I'm sorry?
-Look. Cargo pants buddies.

445
00:24:08,238 --> 00:24:09,906
[chuckles] I bet we have a lot in common.

446
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:14,244
I was a garbage man in Winnipeg.
How about you?

447
00:24:14,828 --> 00:24:16,121
Okay.

448
00:24:17,581 --> 00:24:19,040
Crocs also?

449
00:24:19,124 --> 00:24:20,876
[glass chimes]

450
00:24:20,959 --> 00:24:22,043
Speech time!

451
00:24:22,127 --> 00:24:24,963
You're probably not a magic wizard
trapped in an amulet.

452
00:24:25,046 --> 00:24:27,007
But if you are,
please get me out of this speech.

453
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:30,093
I've asked our top point-getter here
to say a few words.

454
00:24:30,177 --> 00:24:32,470
So, take it away, Eleanor.

455
00:24:32,554 --> 00:24:33,638
[all applaud]

456
00:24:39,102 --> 00:24:43,690
-The dictionary defines "best" as being--
-Oh, God. Boring.

457
00:24:44,524 --> 00:24:46,484
I'd like to say a few words
if nobody minds.

458
00:24:47,068 --> 00:24:48,028
Thank you, wizard.

459
00:24:48,111 --> 00:24:51,156
I am Tahani. Tahani am me.

460
00:24:51,239 --> 00:24:54,993
And even though I wasn't
a "number one point-getter,"

461
00:24:55,076 --> 00:24:57,287
I want to welcome you all
to the neighborhood.

462
00:24:57,370 --> 00:25:01,374
You all look so beautiful tonight
with your regular-size pockets,

463
00:25:02,375 --> 00:25:03,835
regular-size soulmates...

464
00:25:04,419 --> 00:25:06,504
No offense, darling, wherever you are.

465
00:25:06,588 --> 00:25:08,089
Probably somewhere down there.

466
00:25:08,173 --> 00:25:11,676
Why don't you try to ease her
off the stage and take over?

467
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:14,846
The point is,
we're all good people, right?

468
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:17,891
We all did the right thing,
whenever we could.

469
00:25:17,974 --> 00:25:22,312
And that's why it's so nice to be here
among you in this massive house

470
00:25:22,395 --> 00:25:26,983
that I want. I want this house.
Give it. [laughs]

471
00:25:27,067 --> 00:25:29,486
No, I'm kidding.
But really, give me the house.

472
00:25:29,569 --> 00:25:32,239
Hey there, hot stuff.
Can I get you a cup of coffee?

473
00:25:32,322 --> 00:25:36,326
Get your hands off me. You think
you're better than I am, don't you?

474
00:25:36,409 --> 00:25:37,327
Just 'cause you're wearing that.

475
00:25:37,410 --> 00:25:39,913
Look at that terrible placement and angle.

476
00:25:39,996 --> 00:25:41,539
Is this your first time wearing a sash?

477
00:25:41,623 --> 00:25:44,459
Yeah. It is. But I think
if we all just take a break--

478
00:25:44,542 --> 00:25:45,710
Give it to me!

479
00:25:45,794 --> 00:25:48,213
-[all gasp]
-[crashing]

480
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:52,634
I got her off the stage.

481
00:26:00,558 --> 00:26:02,852
Jianyu, come on in.

482
00:26:04,104 --> 00:26:06,898
<i>Before we start,</i>
<i>I know you were a Buddhist monk</i>

483
00:26:06,982 --> 00:26:08,733
who kept a vow of silence.

484
00:26:08,817 --> 00:26:12,612
Would you prefer
to remain silent here, as well?

485
00:26:15,532 --> 00:26:18,618
Every resident here in the Good Place
has a soulmate.

486
00:26:18,702 --> 00:26:22,664
Now, some of the pairings are platonic,
some are romantic.

487
00:26:22,747 --> 00:26:26,042
But what you have with your soulmate
is unique.

488
00:26:26,126 --> 00:26:31,631
You have a spiritual connection
that transcends the physical realm.

489
00:26:33,174 --> 00:26:35,802
This person's gonna be your best bud.

490
00:26:41,683 --> 00:26:45,937
Jianyu, let me introduce you
to your soulmate, Luang.

491
00:26:46,021 --> 00:26:50,275
He is also a Buddhist monk
from the Lumbini zone of Nepal

492
00:26:50,358 --> 00:26:53,236
You and Luang share an identical soul.

493
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:58,992
Like binary stars, orbiting one another
in a perfect reflective harmony.

494
00:26:59,075 --> 00:27:02,871
You won't ever have
a single moment of loneliness

495
00:27:02,954 --> 00:27:06,207
because you'll always be
right next to each other.

496
00:27:06,291 --> 00:27:07,292
For eternity.

497
00:27:08,376 --> 00:27:10,545
I'll let you two get acquainted.

498
00:27:10,628 --> 00:27:14,883
I'm sure you have a lot
to not talk about. [chuckles]

499
00:27:14,966 --> 00:27:17,844
Because... Well, you get it, you get it.

500
00:27:39,741 --> 00:27:40,742
[sighs]

501
00:28:06,017 --> 00:28:08,019
Oh! Sorry. I didn't see you.

502
00:28:08,603 --> 00:28:10,730
Chidi? Are you Chidi?

503
00:28:14,526 --> 00:28:16,194
Eleanor? What are you up to?

504
00:28:16,277 --> 00:28:17,946
Oh! Hey there, Michael.

505
00:28:18,947 --> 00:28:21,157
Just getting to know
everyone in the neighborhood.

506
00:28:22,075 --> 00:28:23,910
Who was that mysterious gentleman?

507
00:28:43,763 --> 00:28:46,057
Hello, you beautiful spirits.

508
00:28:46,141 --> 00:28:48,518
Can I offer you two something to drink?

509
00:28:48,601 --> 00:28:49,811
-Janet.
-Hi, there.

510
00:28:51,229 --> 00:28:55,442
This is Janet. Now, she can get you
literally anything you want.

511
00:28:55,525 --> 00:28:57,110
All you have to do is ask.

512
00:28:57,193 --> 00:29:00,071
Of course,
you two won't ever want anything

513
00:29:00,155 --> 00:29:02,782
because you're perfectly content.

514
00:29:03,783 --> 00:29:08,413
Oh, I know. How about something special?
Janet, two yak's milks, please.

515
00:29:08,496 --> 00:29:09,956
Enjoy.

516
00:29:27,056 --> 00:29:28,725
[glass chimes]

517
00:29:28,808 --> 00:29:29,976
Speech time!

518
00:29:30,059 --> 00:29:32,645
-If we all take a break--
-Give it to me!

519
00:29:32,729 --> 00:29:35,148
-[all gasp]
-[crashing]

520
00:29:35,732 --> 00:29:36,941
I got her off the stage.

521
00:29:37,025 --> 00:29:39,444
Tahani? Are you all right?

522
00:29:39,527 --> 00:29:41,946
Yes. Fine. Never better.

523
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:44,199
Top of my game, actually.

524
00:29:44,282 --> 00:29:46,493
You'll have to excuse me.
I've got to go.

525
00:29:46,576 --> 00:29:49,579
Look. Got some shrimp...

526
00:29:49,662 --> 00:29:53,708
in one of my
many, many cargo pants pockets.

527
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:57,003
-[cries]
-What the fork is happening?

528
00:30:02,675 --> 00:30:04,636
Okay, here we go.

529
00:30:04,719 --> 00:30:06,221
How's it going, boss man?

530
00:30:06,304 --> 00:30:08,973
Enough chit-chat.
Is everything in place for version two?

531
00:30:09,057 --> 00:30:13,144
Yep. I've thought of everything.
I won't let you down.

532
00:30:13,228 --> 00:30:15,355
I'm hoping you could say a few words

533
00:30:15,438 --> 00:30:18,691
at tonight's welcome party
to introduce yourself?

534
00:30:18,775 --> 00:30:20,902
How can I say no? [chuckles]

535
00:30:20,985 --> 00:30:26,407
So cozy.
I feel like the walls are hugging me.

536
00:30:27,534 --> 00:30:31,579
How about something special?
Janet, two yak's milks, please.

537
00:30:32,705 --> 00:30:34,207
Why isn't anyone talking?

538
00:30:34,290 --> 00:30:36,125
[Chidi] Janet, could you show me
to the bar, please?

539
00:30:38,962 --> 00:30:41,339
Michael, may I please
speak with you privately?

540
00:30:41,422 --> 00:30:42,715
Sure. Sure.

541
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:50,223
It just feels like I used to be
"real" Eleanor, and now I'm Denise.

542
00:30:50,306 --> 00:30:53,685
Denise is a good part,
with a great backstory.

543
00:30:54,269 --> 00:30:58,606
You run the best pizza place
in the neighborhood.

544
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:01,943
You have a cat, and that's cool.

545
00:31:02,026 --> 00:31:05,697
I took this job
because it seemed fun and different,

546
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:08,575
and in the original version,
I got to break Chidi's heart

547
00:31:08,658 --> 00:31:13,246
20 times and it was great.
I mean, he was miserable.

548
00:31:13,329 --> 00:31:16,916
And now Angélique gets to torture him?

549
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:20,753
Angélique is a hack.
I can act circles around her.

550
00:31:20,837 --> 00:31:22,463
But I have nothing to do.

551
00:31:22,547 --> 00:31:25,049
I am a Ferrari, okay?

552
00:31:25,133 --> 00:31:28,344
And you don’t keep a Ferrari
in the garage.

553
00:31:28,428 --> 00:31:30,930
I hear your concern. I do.
And I promise you,

554
00:31:31,014 --> 00:31:36,352
there is a great arc coming for Denise,
the pizza lady, in about 80 years or so.

555
00:31:36,436 --> 00:31:39,772
Chidi is going to
accidentally kill your cat.

556
00:31:39,856 --> 00:31:42,483
It's gonna give you
a great chance to shine.

557
00:31:42,567 --> 00:31:46,029
Can I just have
something that makes me stand out?

558
00:31:46,112 --> 00:31:50,116
A mysterious past or a limp?
I want a limp.

559
00:31:50,199 --> 00:31:51,868
This is supposed to be the Good Place.
Why would you--

560
00:31:54,037 --> 00:31:59,000
Okay. No, I hear you. I tell you what.
Go nuts, right? Limp your heart out.

561
00:32:00,877 --> 00:32:03,546
Hey. Chidi, right?

562
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:05,840
Hi. Are you limping?

563
00:32:08,301 --> 00:32:10,720
-How's it going?
-We're having some trouble with Eleanor.

564
00:32:10,803 --> 00:32:13,640
She's not engaging in conversation.
She's not drinking.

565
00:32:13,723 --> 00:32:15,099
Eleanor's not drinking?

566
00:32:15,975 --> 00:32:19,687
She brought a flask in the car
during her driver's test.

567
00:32:20,271 --> 00:32:22,231
Okay, we need to keep things moving here.

568
00:32:22,315 --> 00:32:24,817
I'm about to make her talk for an hour.

569
00:32:24,901 --> 00:32:26,861
She'll definitely end up
insulting somebody.

570
00:32:26,945 --> 00:32:28,237
[glass chimes]

571
00:32:28,321 --> 00:32:29,489
Speech time!

572
00:32:29,572 --> 00:32:31,616
We're all good people, right?

573
00:32:31,699 --> 00:32:34,661
We all did the right thing,
whenever we could.

574
00:32:34,744 --> 00:32:37,330
-If we all take a break--
-Give it to me!

575
00:32:37,413 --> 00:32:39,832
-[all gasp]
-[crashing]

576
00:32:39,916 --> 00:32:42,251
Tahani? Are you all right?

577
00:32:42,335 --> 00:32:44,629
[Tahani] Yes. Fine. Never better.

578
00:32:44,712 --> 00:32:46,172
-You'll have to excuse me.
-Come here.

579
00:32:46,255 --> 00:32:48,091
[Tahani] I've got to go.

580
00:32:49,175 --> 00:32:51,469
-What the fork, man?
-I know that book.

581
00:32:52,053 --> 00:32:55,306
Is that a nerd pickup line?
Because it's only kind of working.

582
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:57,433
No. The note you showed me before?

583
00:32:58,393 --> 00:33:01,813
{\an8}Right, this is from a book called
<i>What We Owe to Each Other.</i>

584
00:33:01,896 --> 00:33:04,482
{\an8}I used to teach it. I was a professor
of ethics and moral philosophy.

585
00:33:04,565 --> 00:33:06,359
-All right, brag much?
-I'm trying to help you.

586
00:33:06,442 --> 00:33:07,485
Sorry. Okay.

587
00:33:07,568 --> 00:33:14,409
I've never seen you before in my life,
but I think, somehow, we know each other.

588
00:33:17,328 --> 00:33:20,581
That definitely sounded like
a pickup line, and I'm not not interested,

589
00:33:20,665 --> 00:33:22,542
but we need to figure this out first.

590
00:33:23,626 --> 00:33:28,172
It's not that bad, right? I mean,
we got a drunken speech. That's good.

591
00:33:28,256 --> 00:33:31,259
No. It isn't.

592
00:33:31,342 --> 00:33:34,470
Tahani gave the drunken speech
instead of Eleanor.

593
00:33:34,554 --> 00:33:37,432
We can't build a chaos sequence
out of Tahani's speech

594
00:33:37,515 --> 00:33:42,020
because she thinks she belongs here,
ya ding-dong.

595
00:33:42,812 --> 00:33:45,857
Okay. We can still salvage this.
Where's Eleanor?

596
00:33:46,566 --> 00:33:49,110
She's gone. I can't find her anywhere.

597
00:33:49,193 --> 00:33:51,654
Maybe she left with Chidi? He's gone, too.

598
00:33:51,738 --> 00:33:54,991
-What?
-Or maybe she left with Jason.

599
00:33:55,074 --> 00:33:58,411
You lost Jason? How's that even possible?

600
00:33:58,494 --> 00:34:01,497
Your only job is
to stand next to that idiot.

601
00:34:01,581 --> 00:34:05,251
I got distracted by the fire.
I love fire.

602
00:34:05,334 --> 00:34:08,463
You know, my main job is to burn people
with fire.

603
00:34:08,546 --> 00:34:09,630
What's up, guys?

604
00:34:09,714 --> 00:34:11,632
What are you doing here?
Why aren't you with Eleanor?

605
00:34:11,716 --> 00:34:13,593
I told her I was going to the gym again.

606
00:34:14,177 --> 00:34:17,013
Why would you say that
in the middle of a party?

607
00:34:17,096 --> 00:34:18,556
-You told me to.
-No. I didn't.

608
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:21,184
You said, if Eleanor tries to confess
she doesn't belong here,

609
00:34:21,267 --> 00:34:24,062
find a reason to avoid her.
Like saying, "I'm going to the gym."

610
00:34:24,145 --> 00:34:25,104
That's what I've been saying.

611
00:34:25,188 --> 00:34:29,358
That was a suggestion of the type of thing
you could say. Don't...

612
00:34:31,027 --> 00:34:35,740
How many times have you specifically
told her you were going to the gym?

613
00:34:36,324 --> 00:34:39,118
Five... No, nine.

614
00:34:39,202 --> 00:34:40,328
You dimwit!

615
00:34:40,411 --> 00:34:44,957
Hey, man. I was perfectly happy
in my old job in the twisting department.

616
00:34:45,041 --> 00:34:48,044
People came in, and I'd twist them
until they snapped in half,

617
00:34:48,127 --> 00:34:52,131
and I'd move on to the next one.
But this job is weird!

618
00:34:52,215 --> 00:34:54,634
-[all agreeing]
-It's all talk, no twisting.

619
00:34:54,717 --> 00:34:56,803
If you don't like the way I do it,
get somebody else.

620
00:34:56,886 --> 00:34:58,262
I'm going to the gym!

621
00:34:58,346 --> 00:35:00,473
Fine. Yeah, you do that.
You go to the gym.

622
00:35:01,057 --> 00:35:02,475
Okay. We can still pull this off.

623
00:35:02,558 --> 00:35:05,186
We just need to find the four humans.
Okay?

624
00:35:05,269 --> 00:35:06,604
[claps] Okay.

625
00:35:06,687 --> 00:35:08,815
[chuckles] Right now.

626
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:15,905
Everyone in this room,
find those four humans!

627
00:35:18,699 --> 00:35:20,827
Are you gonna talk
or walk around like a nerd

628
00:35:20,910 --> 00:35:23,162
trying to get a personal best
on his Fitbit?

629
00:35:23,246 --> 00:35:27,834
I'm sorry. I'm trying to process
a tremendous amount of insane information.

630
00:35:27,917 --> 00:35:29,627
I mean, you're not supposed to be here.

631
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:33,798
But you and I clearly met here
somehow before now.

632
00:35:33,881 --> 00:35:36,217
Does that mean
I'm not supposed to be here?

633
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:39,137
I don't know, dude.
Were you a good person on Earth?

634
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:42,598
I think so. I spent my life in pursuit
of fundamental truths about the...

635
00:35:42,682 --> 00:35:43,933
[gasps] Oh, no!

636
00:35:45,268 --> 00:35:46,936
I used almond milk in my coffee,

637
00:35:47,019 --> 00:35:49,355
even though I knew
about the negative environmental impact.

638
00:35:49,438 --> 00:35:50,481
What?

639
00:35:50,565 --> 00:35:53,359
-Eleanor, what do we do?
-I don't know, dude!

640
00:35:53,442 --> 00:35:57,196
But we better figure it out soon
or we're doomed.

641
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:07,790
-Uh... Janet?
-Hi, there, Jianyu.

642
00:36:07,874 --> 00:36:09,167
Hi, Janet.

643
00:36:09,876 --> 00:36:11,794
-Can I tell you something?
-Sure.

644
00:36:11,878 --> 00:36:16,382
I'm not Jianyu. And I'm not a silent monk.

645
00:36:16,465 --> 00:36:18,259
My real name is Jason.

646
00:36:18,342 --> 00:36:21,345
I don't know what's going on.
I got here and Michael said I'm a monk,

647
00:36:21,429 --> 00:36:23,472
and he told me
I was gonna have a new best friend,

648
00:36:23,556 --> 00:36:25,516
and that we were going to live
in a yogurt.

649
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:27,977
-A yurt.
-Oh, yeah. Yurt, for short.

650
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:29,854
I was psyched to meet my new best friend.

651
00:36:29,937 --> 00:36:34,901
But he turned out to be this weird
silent guy that won't leave me alone.

652
00:36:34,984 --> 00:36:39,947
I don't want to go back to my yogurt.
Can I go to your house?

653
00:36:40,031 --> 00:36:44,076
I don't have a house, Jason.
I live in a boundless void.

654
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,369
Can I go there?

655
00:36:45,453 --> 00:36:48,331
No. It's a boundless void.

656
00:36:49,373 --> 00:36:51,876
-Okay.
-So, what you're saying is,

657
00:36:51,959 --> 00:36:55,087
there are certain aspects of your
existence here in the Good Place

658
00:36:55,171 --> 00:36:56,631
that are confusing for you?

659
00:36:56,714 --> 00:37:00,760
And you're searching for someplace to go
where you feel less lonely.

660
00:37:02,053 --> 00:37:03,179
I know somewhere you could go.

661
00:37:07,016 --> 00:37:08,226
Why did you do that?

662
00:37:08,309 --> 00:37:11,312
Because you were nice to me.
You're my friend.

663
00:37:11,395 --> 00:37:12,647
Okay.

664
00:37:15,316 --> 00:37:16,317
[Jianyu] Okay.

665
00:37:17,443 --> 00:37:19,695
If we got all the way to Scanlon,

666
00:37:19,779 --> 00:37:23,366
we must have been studying very intensely
for a long time.

667
00:37:23,449 --> 00:37:26,827
Or you grabbed a random book of mine,
and tore a page out.

668
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:28,829
I'll be honest.
That sounds more like me.

669
00:37:28,913 --> 00:37:30,414
-[rapid knocking]
-Ah!

670
00:37:31,123 --> 00:37:33,834
Eleanor and Chidi.
What a pleasant surprise.

671
00:37:33,918 --> 00:37:35,711
I'm so happy you two have met.

672
00:37:35,795 --> 00:37:40,466
I'm just going door-to-door, apologizing
for the commotion earlier tonight.

673
00:37:40,549 --> 00:37:44,095
The first night in the afterlife can be
a little overwhelming.

674
00:37:44,178 --> 00:37:46,555
Don't worry about us, Michael.
We are doing fine.

675
00:37:46,639 --> 00:37:48,432
Oh, good. Glad to hear that.

676
00:37:48,516 --> 00:37:49,809
Well, it's getting late.

677
00:37:49,892 --> 00:37:53,104
Chidi, allow me to escort you
back to your house.

678
00:37:54,021 --> 00:37:56,315
Hello, all. Sorry for the late hour.

679
00:37:56,399 --> 00:37:59,402
Eleanor, I wanted to stop by
and give you back your sash.

680
00:37:59,485 --> 00:38:02,989
-That's okay. You can just keep it.
-No! I don't deserve it.

681
00:38:03,072 --> 00:38:06,450
I made a complete fool of myself tonight.
I interrupted your big speech,

682
00:38:06,534 --> 00:38:10,955
badly stained my cargo pants which,
I have to admit, are quite comfortable.

683
00:38:11,038 --> 00:38:15,459
Oh, God, what's happened to me?
I'm praising off-the-rack separates.

684
00:38:15,543 --> 00:38:17,253
Tahani, please, it's late.
What we should do--

685
00:38:17,336 --> 00:38:21,340
No. Look, ever since I got here,
it feels like something's been off.

686
00:38:21,424 --> 00:38:25,511
Tahani. There you are.
I've been worried sick about you.

687
00:38:25,594 --> 00:38:27,138
[Eleanor] That's her soulmate?

688
00:38:27,221 --> 00:38:30,182
Is there a second one of him
that stands on his shoulders?

689
00:38:30,266 --> 00:38:33,352
Chidi, there you are.
I've been worried sick about you.

690
00:38:33,436 --> 00:38:37,565
Okay. All right, everybody, now we are
really imposing on Eleanor here.

691
00:38:37,648 --> 00:38:40,067
-Chidi, let's everybody take off--
-Hey, Eleanor...

692
00:38:40,151 --> 00:38:44,697
This person would like to speak with you.
Privately. About something.

693
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:46,073
Oh, really?

694
00:38:46,157 --> 00:38:48,034
Yep. Bye.

695
00:38:48,117 --> 00:38:50,619
[Eleanor] This is the wise monk
who gave me the magic amulet.

696
00:38:50,703 --> 00:38:53,414
I gotta figure out what it means.
Could be the key to this mystery.

697
00:38:53,497 --> 00:38:54,999
Luang. Perfect.

698
00:38:55,583 --> 00:38:58,836
Why don't you take Jianyu
back to your yurt? Right away.

699
00:38:58,919 --> 00:39:00,838
Homie, no.

700
00:39:00,921 --> 00:39:03,799
I'm not spending another second
with this loser.

701
00:39:03,883 --> 00:39:06,761
You said he was going to be
my best friend, but he is not.

702
00:39:06,844 --> 00:39:11,307
My best friend from Jacksonville
was named Pillboi and he was dope!

703
00:39:11,390 --> 00:39:15,436
We would talk together, get high together,
throw old batteries at drones together,

704
00:39:15,519 --> 00:39:17,938
but this guy can't hold
a camel to Pillboi.

705
00:39:18,522 --> 00:39:20,608
Okay, I no longer think he's a wise monk,

706
00:39:20,691 --> 00:39:22,485
and I'm pretty sure
this is just a piece of garbage.

707
00:39:22,568 --> 00:39:24,904
-Babe, there you are. I've been worried--
-[Eleanor] Let me stop you.

708
00:39:24,987 --> 00:39:27,907
Can I guess?
You've been worried sick about me.

709
00:39:29,325 --> 00:39:30,201
I'm headed to the gym.

710
00:39:32,286 --> 00:39:35,206
-Sure. Why not?
-I'm quite confused.

711
00:39:35,289 --> 00:39:37,291
Let me explain, gorgeous.

712
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:40,920
I don't know what this place is,
but it is certainly not the Good Place.

713
00:39:41,545 --> 00:39:43,756
Michael is forking with us.

714
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:46,425
-Like a prank show?
-Yeah! Like a prank show!

715
00:39:46,509 --> 00:39:50,971
Except, according to this note, it's
a prank show we've all been on before.

716
00:39:51,055 --> 00:39:51,931
What note?

717
00:39:52,014 --> 00:39:55,476
Apparently, I wrote myself a note,
and stuck it in that Jackie lady's mouth.

718
00:39:55,559 --> 00:39:56,435
Janet. Her name is Janet.

719
00:39:56,519 --> 00:39:58,187
-Oh! Right. Janet.
-Hi, there.

720
00:39:58,270 --> 00:39:59,397
-Hi, Janet.
-Hi, Jason.

721
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:01,232
[laughs]

722
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:04,985
Are you kidding me?

723
00:40:05,069 --> 00:40:10,699
Eleanor Shellstrop,
you sneaky little so-and-so.

724
00:40:10,783 --> 00:40:14,995
That was some very quick thinking.
I'm extremely impressed.

725
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:18,624
And, to be honest, I'm relieved.

726
00:40:18,707 --> 00:40:22,711
At least there's an explanation
for why this all went south so fast.

727
00:40:22,795 --> 00:40:25,172
But you won't be so lucky next time.

728
00:40:25,256 --> 00:40:26,799
-Next time?
-Yeah.

729
00:40:26,882 --> 00:40:28,384
He's going to do it again.

730
00:40:29,093 --> 00:40:32,054
That's not going to work this time, dummy.

731
00:40:32,138 --> 00:40:34,723
Okay. Excuse me.
I'm sorry, but this is unacceptable.

732
00:40:34,807 --> 00:40:36,350
I demand to speak to your superior.

733
00:40:36,434 --> 00:40:39,687
I am so sorry, madam.
Please forgive me. [snaps fingers]

734
00:40:40,771 --> 00:40:45,776
Well, as humans like to say,
"Third time's the charm." Right?

735
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:46,694
[all groaning]

736
00:40:46,777 --> 00:40:50,281
I take full responsibility
for the false start.

737
00:40:50,364 --> 00:40:54,243
But I assure you all,
there is no note this time.

738
00:40:54,326 --> 00:40:55,703
I'll prove it to you.

739
00:40:55,786 --> 00:40:57,413
-Janet!
-Hi, there.

740
00:40:57,496 --> 00:40:59,957
Hi, Janet.
Open your mouth, please.

741
00:41:00,958 --> 00:41:02,209
Thank you.

742
00:41:04,795 --> 00:41:07,923
See, no notes, no clues or loopholes.

743
00:41:08,007 --> 00:41:09,508
Nothing in there.

744
00:41:10,718 --> 00:41:11,719
Thank you, Janet.

745
00:41:11,802 --> 00:41:15,514
So, let's all pretend the last attempt
never even happened. Questions.

746
00:41:15,598 --> 00:41:19,143
Maybe it's none of our business,
but did you tell Shawn what happened?

747
00:41:19,226 --> 00:41:22,897
Yes, I did. And he completely understood.

748
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:25,649
As a matter of fact, he found
the whole thing kind of funny.

749
00:41:25,733 --> 00:41:27,359
But he was very supportive.

750
00:41:27,443 --> 00:41:30,321
He says he's very excited
for us to get going again.

751
00:41:30,404 --> 00:41:32,198
So, anyone else?

752
00:41:32,281 --> 00:41:34,909
Anybody? No?

753
00:41:34,992 --> 00:41:37,286
{\an8}Let's get out there
and make some miseries.

754
00:41:40,789 --> 00:41:42,917
{\an8}Testing, one, two, three.

755
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,210
{\an8}[line ringing]

756
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,254
{\an8}Hey there, boss man.

757
00:41:47,338 --> 00:41:50,132
{\an8}You were supposed to call me this morning,
give me an update.

758
00:41:51,258 --> 00:41:52,635
{\an8}Right. Sorry. Yeah.

759
00:41:52,718 --> 00:41:56,514
{\an8}It's just, the, um...
The chaos sequence was going so well.

760
00:41:56,597 --> 00:41:58,849
{\an8}Better than the first time, in my opinion.

761
00:41:58,933 --> 00:42:01,810
{\an8}Eleanor got completely drunk last night.

762
00:42:01,894 --> 00:42:04,897
{\an8}She talked for like an hour,
even flashed somebody.

763
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:06,482
{\an8}So, we had a lot to work with.

764
00:42:06,565 --> 00:42:08,234
So attempt number two is on track so far?

765
00:42:08,317 --> 00:42:10,402
Smooth as silk. Everything's great.

766
00:42:10,486 --> 00:42:12,738
-[distant screaming]
-Oh...

767
00:42:12,821 --> 00:42:14,698
Sounds like everything's
going well back there, too.

768
00:42:14,782 --> 00:42:16,325
We're trying out the new butthole spiders.

769
00:42:16,408 --> 00:42:18,327
-Ah!
-They're enormous.

770
00:42:18,410 --> 00:42:19,870
You know, good old-fashioned torture.

771
00:42:19,954 --> 00:42:21,038
The way it's supposed to be.

772
00:42:21,747 --> 00:42:23,791
Good luck with attempt number two.

773
00:42:23,874 --> 00:42:27,044
And, remember, there will be
no attempt number three.

774
00:42:31,131 --> 00:42:33,467
Eleanor, come on in.
