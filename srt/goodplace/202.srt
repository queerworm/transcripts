00:00:02,419 --> 00:00:05,588
{\an8}This is daily notes log
for attempt number three

2
00:00:05,672 --> 00:00:07,382
{\an8}of my neighborhood experiment.

3
00:00:08,675 --> 00:00:13,179
Obviously, I hope and assume
this will be the final version.

4
00:00:14,055 --> 00:00:16,349
No, I know it will be.

5
00:00:16,433 --> 00:00:19,060
All the kinks have been worked out.
This is the one.

6
00:00:19,894 --> 00:00:21,521
And after I pull this off,

7
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:25,859
they're gonna hang my picture
in the Bad Place Hall of Fame,

8
00:00:25,942 --> 00:00:29,738
right next to the guy
who invented bees with teeth.

9
00:00:29,821 --> 00:00:31,114

10
00:00:31,906 --> 00:00:34,784
{\an8}You, Eleanor Shellstrop, are dead.

11
00:00:34,868 --> 00:00:35,952
{\an8}Cool.

12
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:38,913
I'm Chris Baker. I'm your soulmate.

13
00:00:38,997 --> 00:00:40,206
Bring it in, man.

14
00:00:40,957 --> 00:00:43,042
Sorry, I must ask.

15
00:00:43,126 --> 00:00:46,337
Why are you wearing a sash
that says "Best Person" on it?

16
00:00:46,421 --> 00:00:50,049
Apparently, I am the number one
points-getter in the entire neighborhood.

17
00:00:50,133 --> 00:00:53,970
Is that so? I always have to have
my sashes custom-made

18
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:56,389
due to my height and bosom size.

19
00:00:56,473 --> 00:00:59,100
Also, apparently,
sashes are out this season.

20
00:00:59,184 --> 00:01:02,812
The diagonal line
really draws one's eye to the chin bloat.

{\an8}Oh, boy.

-Hi, there.

Still not used to it.

30
00:01:29,672 --> 00:01:35,428
Uh, hey. What if I, an already amazing
person who definitely belongs here,

31
00:01:35,512 --> 00:01:38,848
wanted to learn even more
about how to be a good person?

32
00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:41,976
Is one of these nerds, like, a teacher
or a life coach

33
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:43,978
or an Instagram fitness model
or something?

34
00:01:45,188 --> 00:01:48,399
Eleanor, I'd like you to meet
Chidi Anagonye.

35
00:01:48,483 --> 00:01:50,360
Chidi, this is Eleanor.

36
00:01:50,443 --> 00:01:52,987
Janet tells me you were
a professor of some kind.

37
00:01:53,071 --> 00:01:56,199
Yes. I was a professor of ethics
and moral philosophy,

38
00:01:56,282 --> 00:01:57,826
focusing on deontology.

39
00:01:57,909 --> 00:01:59,619
Hang on one second, Cheebee.

40
00:01:59,744 --> 00:02:00,995
Um...

41
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:03,248
This guy's too big of a nerd.
Who else you got?

42
00:02:04,457 --> 00:02:06,501
{\an8}-Michael, what do we do here?
-I don't know.

43
00:02:06,584 --> 00:02:10,588
{\an8}Apparently, the Bad Place knows
one of you belongs down there with them,

44
00:02:10,672 --> 00:02:13,258
and they want that person
to get inside the obelisk,

45
00:02:13,341 --> 00:02:14,717
or they're gonna take all of you.

46
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:16,928
I can't go! I'm too young to die!

47
00:02:17,011 --> 00:02:20,849
And too old to eat off the kids' menu!
What a stupid age I am!

48
00:02:20,932 --> 00:02:22,350
[Tahani] I'd never survive down there.

49
00:02:22,433 --> 00:02:24,727
They should take Eleanor.
She's a pear shape. She'd fit right in.

50
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:27,397
Oh, excuse me? You wish
you could have a bite of this pear.

51
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,107
I'll go! I deserve to go. You can stay.

52
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:30,525
-Chidi, you're not going.
-[Jason] Oh, yes!

53
00:02:30,608 --> 00:02:31,568
[Chidi] No, I have to go.

54
00:02:31,651 --> 00:02:32,819
[all clamoring]

55
00:02:32,902 --> 00:02:34,154

56
00:02:34,237 --> 00:02:36,656
Holy forking shirt!

57
00:02:36,739 --> 00:02:40,910
You guys, don't you get it?
Michael is torturing us.

58
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:45,081
That's why our lives have been
so miserable since the moment we got here.

59
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:48,668
This isn't the Good Place.
It's the Bad Place.

60
00:02:48,751 --> 00:02:50,295
[laughing]

61
00:02:52,046 --> 00:02:53,590
Ah, farts.

62
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:55,675
[theme music playing]

63
00:03:01,472 --> 00:03:04,767
[Michael] Okay. Attempt number 11.
Let's focus on the positives.

64
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:06,519
{\an8}Eleanor always hates her house.

65
00:03:07,186 --> 00:03:11,441
{\an8}Tahani always hates Eleanor.
Jason hates being quiet.

66
00:03:11,524 --> 00:03:13,735
Chidi immediately gets a stomachache.

67
00:03:13,818 --> 00:03:16,112
So there's a lot to work with here.

68
00:03:17,405 --> 00:03:18,948
{\an8}Hang on one second, Cheeto.

69
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:23,119
{\an8}So it's gonna be a hard pass
on superdork Jones over there.

70
00:03:23,202 --> 00:03:24,704
Anybody else you got to teach me?

71
00:03:24,787 --> 00:03:27,957
{\an8}You guys ready for our lesson?
We're talking David Hume today.

00:03:30,335 --> 00:03:33,379
{\an8}Sounds like a real banger,
but you guys gotta scram.

{\an8}Well, you two are certainly getting along
very well these days.

{\an8}Yeah, I'm actually kind of
into Sebastian lately.

167
00:08:03,274 --> 00:08:05,485
{\an8}Chidi's teaching Eleanor,
but she hates it.

168
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:08,821
{\an8}Tahani still thinks that Jason's a monk.

169
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:10,823
Everyone's miserable.

170
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:12,992
I'm so happy.

171
00:08:13,075 --> 00:08:14,577
Fingers crossed.

172
00:08:18,581 --> 00:08:21,375
Vicky, where is everyone?

173
00:08:22,043 --> 00:08:25,796
They're not coming, Michael.
You have lost control of this experiment.

174
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:29,342
So we are on strike
until our demands are met.

175
00:08:31,594 --> 00:08:34,555
I speak for the entire crew, Michael.
We're sick of it.

176
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:37,391
We can barely remember
what we're supposed to be doing anymore.

177
00:08:37,475 --> 00:08:42,271
Plus, I spent weeks perfecting this
excellent Australian accent, I did.

178
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:44,315
And then I never got a chance to use it.

179
00:08:44,398 --> 00:08:46,526
You're still upset
about the size of your part?

180
00:08:46,609 --> 00:08:50,738
Yes! I want a more important role.
But that's just my demand.

181
00:08:50,821 --> 00:08:54,408
All 318 of us have something
we want to do differently.

182
00:08:54,492 --> 00:08:56,869
Some people want bigger houses.

183
00:08:56,953 --> 00:09:01,249
Gayle wants a different backstory
where she was an MMA fighter?

184
00:09:01,332 --> 00:09:05,962
Gunnar wants to bite and/or nibble
on humans while they sleep.

185
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:09,048
You do know, Vicky,
that if I were to do some of these,

186
00:09:09,131 --> 00:09:10,550
that it would be a dead giveaway.

187
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:12,802
And I can help you explain that to them.

188
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:14,845
But some of these are doable,

189
00:09:15,513 --> 00:09:16,806
and you're gonna do 'em.

190
00:09:17,598 --> 00:09:22,562
So, Aristotle believes your character
is voluntary, because...

191
00:09:22,645 --> 00:09:24,814
Uh, are you ignoring me right now?

192
00:09:24,897 --> 00:09:28,901
It's day two of our ethics lessons,
and you're already tuning out?

193
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:31,195
No, sorry. I just got distracted
for a second.

194
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:33,447
The last thing I remember you saying is...

195
00:09:34,115 --> 00:09:36,450
Nothing. Can you start from the beginning?

196
00:09:36,534 --> 00:09:38,160
Okay. I need a little break.

197
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:41,998
Can we take a walk or something?
Maybe get some clam chowder?

198
00:09:48,129 --> 00:09:49,130
Where is everyone?

199
00:09:49,714 --> 00:09:50,631
Who knows?

200
00:09:50,715 --> 00:09:53,676
Maybe they finally figured out
clam chowder is disgusting

201
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:56,679
'cause it's basically a savory latte
with bugs in it.

202
00:09:57,555 --> 00:09:58,639
[sniffs]

203
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:02,018
Is someone smoking a cigar?

204
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:05,438
Michael really screwed this up.

205
00:10:05,521 --> 00:10:07,398
The regular Bad Place was fine.

206
00:10:07,481 --> 00:10:10,735
If the four-headed flying bears
ain't broke, don't fix 'em.

207
00:10:10,818 --> 00:10:12,653
What was wrong with impaling?
I loved impaling.

208
00:10:13,321 --> 00:10:14,822
Hey, Todd? Got a light?

209
00:10:14,905 --> 00:10:17,950
Uh, yeah. Obviously I have a light.

210
00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:19,910
You know, you guys
aren't supposed to be smoking.

211
00:10:19,994 --> 00:10:21,871
You're supposed to keep
your human suit on.

212
00:10:21,954 --> 00:10:23,539
Those suits are really itchy for us.

213
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:27,376
Who even cares if they see us?
They're just gonna get rebooted anyway.

214
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:31,213
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

215
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:34,383
This is the Bad Place. I forking knew it!

216
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:36,469
And clam chowder is disgusting.

217
00:10:36,552 --> 00:10:39,889
It's just hot ocean milk
with dead animal croutons.

218
00:10:39,972 --> 00:10:41,223
What do we do? Panic? Freak?

219
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:44,226
-I usually panic, but I am happy to freak.
-No, we have to stay cool.

220
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:46,062
As my mom always used to say,

221
00:10:46,687 --> 00:10:48,773
"If a cop handcuffs you to a bike rack,

222
00:10:48,856 --> 00:10:50,983
there's always something
you can gnaw through."

223
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:53,110
Your mom always said that?

224
00:10:53,194 --> 00:10:55,946
Think. Come on, brain! Janet!

225
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:57,406
Hi, there. How can I help you?

226
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:58,449
-Um--
-Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

227
00:10:58,532 --> 00:10:59,533
How do we know she's not a part of it?

228
00:11:00,451 --> 00:11:03,079
We don't. But we gotta risk it.

229
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:05,956
Janet, can we, um, like,
leave the neighborhood?

230
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:09,794
Get as far away as possible?
Is there anywhere we can go?

231
00:11:11,253 --> 00:11:14,965
So, we're in the Bad Place,
and I know why.

232
00:11:15,049 --> 00:11:16,342
Almond milk.

233
00:11:16,425 --> 00:11:17,885
I knew it was bad for the environment,

234
00:11:17,968 --> 00:11:20,721
but I loved the way it coated my tongue
with a weird film.

235
00:11:20,805 --> 00:11:22,973
Who else is being tortured?
Are we the only two?

236
00:11:23,057 --> 00:11:24,850
I gotta assume Jason is as well.

237
00:11:24,934 --> 00:11:28,270
Jianyu. You know him as Jianyu,
but his real name is Jason.

238
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:30,398
-And he's a dirtbag from Florida.
-What?

239
00:11:30,481 --> 00:11:33,317
Also, Tahani is a candidate,
as far as I'm concerned.

240
00:11:33,401 --> 00:11:36,487
Yesterday, she told me
that she was Taylor Swift's best friend,

241
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:38,406
but Taylor Swift wasn't her best friend.

242
00:11:38,489 --> 00:11:40,366
-She sucks.
-[chuckles]

243
00:11:40,449 --> 00:11:43,577
No offense, but I can't believe
you and I ended up in the same place.

244
00:11:43,661 --> 00:11:45,454
Hey, I'm not thrilled
about it either, bud.

245
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:48,207
I always assumed the afterlife
was full of cool people,

246
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:50,376
-not talking sweater-vests.
-You--

247
00:11:50,459 --> 00:11:52,878
-[door opens]
-We're here. Aren't trains neat?

248
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:54,839
Choo choo!

249
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:01,220
[knocking at door]

250
00:12:02,638 --> 00:12:05,307
Hi. You gotta help us.
I'm Eleanor. This is Chidi.

251
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:08,102
And, see, we thought we were in
the Good Place, but as it turns out--

252
00:12:08,185 --> 00:12:11,897
Yeah, guys. I know.
You've been here 15 times already.

253
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:12,815
What?

254
00:12:12,898 --> 00:12:14,817
Did you bring the cocaine I asked for?

255
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:17,445
Please tell me
you somehow remembered this time.

256
00:12:17,528 --> 00:12:19,697
Mama needs her medicine.

257
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:20,781
We've met before?

258
00:12:21,824 --> 00:12:23,617
-I'm Janet.
-I know.

259
00:12:24,326 --> 00:12:26,704
Vicky, let's look at the big picture here.

260
00:12:26,787 --> 00:12:31,167
Now, if you all can just stick
with my plan and we pull it off,

261
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:32,501
we'll be heroes.

262
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:34,503
You could write your own ticket.

263
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:37,506
You might even land
the Jared from Subway account.

264
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:41,260
Yeah. But I don't think
you can pull it off.

265
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:44,013
You can't even pull off those bow ties.

266
00:12:45,389 --> 00:12:46,432
That was very mean.

267
00:12:46,515 --> 00:12:49,894
But I'm gonna move past that
in the name of unit cohesion.

268
00:12:49,977 --> 00:12:52,897
You're gonna reboot
those four dum-dums one more time,

269
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:54,565
and then I'm taking over.

270
00:12:54,648 --> 00:12:57,443
I'm going to execute
my version of this neighborhood.

271
00:12:57,526 --> 00:13:01,238
You see, I've been working on it
while all of your versions fell apart.

272
00:13:01,864 --> 00:13:03,699
This is insubordination.

273
00:13:03,782 --> 00:13:07,119
And if you do not do
what I tell you immediately,

274
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:09,205
you are going down.

275
00:13:11,749 --> 00:13:14,460
That's a complete report
of every mistake you've made.

276
00:13:14,543 --> 00:13:20,257
Every screw-up, every reboot,
all laid out in excruciating detail.

277
00:13:20,341 --> 00:13:22,676
Now, I'm sure your boss would love to hear

278
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:26,388
all about how "Attempt Number Two"
is really going. [chuckles]

279
00:13:27,389 --> 00:13:32,561
So, actually, if you don't do what I say,
you're going down.

280
00:13:33,187 --> 00:13:34,688
[with Australian accent] Down under.

281
00:13:37,983 --> 00:13:39,568
[Eleanor] Is it always the three of us?

282
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:43,197
It's always at least Eleanor and Janet.
Usually Chidi's in the mix.

283
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:47,451
Sometimes Jason is here.
One time Jason and Tahani were here.

284
00:13:47,535 --> 00:13:49,578
But, you know what?
No matter what the combo is,

285
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:53,123
I always ask you guys to bring me
cocaine next time and you never do.

286
00:13:53,207 --> 00:13:54,542
Do you have anything I can snort?

287
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:58,671
Like a crushed-up aspirin
or some eye shadow or cocaine?

288
00:13:58,754 --> 00:13:59,630
Still no.

289
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:03,342
There's only one question we need
to answer right now, and that is:

290
00:14:03,425 --> 00:14:04,802
What do we do next?

291
00:14:04,885 --> 00:14:07,096
I mean, this place doesn't seem terrible.

292
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:09,390
[both] Maybe we should stay here forever.

293
00:14:09,473 --> 00:14:12,601
You always say that.
And you always end up going back.

294
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:14,061
I mean, sometimes you go back

295
00:14:14,144 --> 00:14:16,272
because you feel bad your friends
don't know what you know.

296
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:19,233
Sometimes you go back because you
walk in on me while I'm masturbating.

297
00:14:19,316 --> 00:14:23,237
And sometimes you go back because
I walk in on you while I'm masturbating.

298
00:14:23,988 --> 00:14:26,073
But no matter what, you always go back.

299
00:14:26,156 --> 00:14:29,702
You formulate a plan to defeat Michael,
and you head back.

300
00:14:29,785 --> 00:14:33,163
Okay, a plan. We need a plan. But...

301
00:14:33,247 --> 00:14:35,916
[both] What if we come up with a plan
we've already tried before?

302
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,376
Will you please stop that?

303
00:14:38,419 --> 00:14:41,463
Yeah. Just to help you out a little,

304
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:44,216
I've written down every plan
you've ever come up with,

305
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:49,179
which obviously never worked because
you're here and you're back, so good luck.

306
00:14:49,263 --> 00:14:52,141
"Physically attack Michael.
Seduce Michael.

307
00:14:52,224 --> 00:14:54,435
Make Michael think
he's the one in the Bad Place.

308
00:14:54,518 --> 00:14:57,771
Catch that magic panda, use her powers."

309
00:14:58,439 --> 00:15:00,065
Oh, I'm guessing that was Jason.

310
00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:02,818
That guy has no idea what's going on.

311
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:09,033
Hello? Hello? Where is everyone?

312
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:12,077
-Janet?
-Hey there, Jason.

313
00:15:12,161 --> 00:15:13,579
Oh, hey, homie.

314
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:15,414
Uh...

315
00:15:15,497 --> 00:15:20,836
I mean, Jason? Who is Jason? I am a monk.

316
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,087
You know what?

317
00:15:23,631 --> 00:15:25,549
Can I talk to you for a second?

318
00:15:25,633 --> 00:15:30,346
I'm in a tight spot, and I could use
someone to bounce some ideas off of, okay?

319
00:15:31,013 --> 00:15:32,806
Oh, yeah, uh, real quick...

320
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:35,809
You're really in the Bad Place,
and you're being tortured.

321
00:15:35,893 --> 00:15:36,977
What?

322
00:15:37,061 --> 00:15:41,315
I know it says here that we already tried
throwing Tahani under the bus,

323
00:15:41,398 --> 00:15:43,692
but maybe we should revisit that.

324
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:46,654
Throw her a little bit harder.
Maybe under a bigger bus.

325
00:15:46,737 --> 00:15:47,738
What do you think?

326
00:15:47,821 --> 00:15:50,699
I think this is pointless.

327
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:54,328
We are trapped in a warped version
of Nietzsche's eternal recurrence.

328
00:15:54,411 --> 00:15:57,039
Oh, cool! More philosophy!
That'll help us.

329
00:15:57,122 --> 00:15:59,375
Well, don't you see the problem?
We are experiencing karma,

330
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:02,795
but we can't learn from our mistakes
because our memories keep getting erased.

331
00:16:02,878 --> 00:16:05,089
It's an epistemological nightmare.

332
00:16:05,172 --> 00:16:07,341
Ugh! Even your nightmares are boring.

333
00:16:07,424 --> 00:16:09,760
[stammers] You are so mean, Eleanor.

334
00:16:09,843 --> 00:16:12,888
You're just like those childhood bullies
who said I would never get tenure.

335
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:14,848
And you are so irritating!

336
00:16:14,932 --> 00:16:17,184
In one of these reboots,
I probably strangled you

337
00:16:17,267 --> 00:16:18,936
and then went to the Even Worse Place.

338
00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:22,147
But you know what? I bet it was worth it.

339
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:23,357
Oh, nice.

340
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,483
Ugh!

341
00:16:24,566 --> 00:16:28,946
Sorry, can I just vent to you?
Chidi is so annoying.

342
00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:32,574
I just... I cannot believe that he
is the one I'm stuck here with.

343
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:34,451
Uh-huh. Wow. Crazy.

344
00:16:34,535 --> 00:16:35,744
Oh, sorry. Jeez, man,

345
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:39,123
I thought you could be human
for, like, two seconds and listen to me.

346
00:16:39,206 --> 00:16:41,291
[sighs] I have, Eleanor.

347
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:45,629
I have listened to you talk about Chidi
15 times in 15 different ways.

348
00:16:45,713 --> 00:16:49,717
Let me cut to the chase.
You two? You got it bad for each other.

349
00:16:50,801 --> 00:16:53,303
No, we don't. Chidi's a friend.
What am I saying?

350
00:16:53,387 --> 00:16:57,057
He's not even a friend.
He's a weird teacher that I hate.

351
00:16:57,141 --> 00:16:58,684
[sighs]

352
00:16:59,977 --> 00:17:02,896
Dude, I do not wanna watch
<i>Cannonball Run II</i> right now.

353
00:17:03,731 --> 00:17:07,192
Or... all right. What happened
in the first one, so I'm all caught up?

354
00:17:08,527 --> 00:17:12,322
<i>I don't know what's gonna happen to us,</i>
<i>but I need to tell you something.</i>

355
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:15,534
<i>I love you.</i>

356
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:17,661
<i>And you don't need to respond,</i>

357
00:17:17,745 --> 00:17:20,748
<i>'cause I know you have trouble</i>
<i>saying how you feel.</i>

358
00:17:20,831 --> 00:17:21,749
<i>I love you, too.</i>

359
00:17:21,832 --> 00:17:22,666
[scoffs]

360
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:25,586
Very funny. But that's obviously not real.

361
00:17:25,669 --> 00:17:29,923
Oh, that's real, baby.
That's real nasty. [laughs]

362
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:33,677
Yeah, this was the sixth time
you guys were here.

363
00:17:33,761 --> 00:17:36,013
I saw you getting sexy
the previous three times,

364
00:17:36,096 --> 00:17:38,557
so I cut a little hole in the wall
so I could tape ya.

365
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,184
Call it my lookin' hole.

366
00:17:40,267 --> 00:17:41,518
<i>Is that a camera?</i>

367
00:17:41,602 --> 00:17:43,937
<i>Mindy. You pervert!</i>

368
00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:48,442
How many times
have Chidi and I slept together?

369
00:17:48,525 --> 00:17:51,487
Eight different days,
but, like, 20 different sessions.

370
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:55,282
And how many times did we say...
that stuff?

371
00:17:55,365 --> 00:17:56,283
Oh, only once.

372
00:17:56,366 --> 00:17:59,912
Oh, God, I hated it.
It, like, really killed the vibe for me.

373
00:17:59,995 --> 00:18:02,539
See, after I watched
the porno I made starring you,

374
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:05,084
I watch you talk about your feelings
to cool down.

375
00:18:05,167 --> 00:18:06,668
It's like anti-porn.

376
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:11,757
I've only ever said "I love you"
to two men my entire life.

377
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:16,220
"Stone Cold" Steve Austin
and a guy in a dark club,

378
00:18:16,303 --> 00:18:18,847
who I mistook
for "Stone Cold" Steve Austin.

379
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:20,724
I mean, why would you show me that?

380
00:18:20,808 --> 00:18:24,228
I don't know.
You guys are, like, trapped here together.

381
00:18:24,311 --> 00:18:25,562
I feel bad.

382
00:18:25,646 --> 00:18:27,147
You know, I'm rooting for you guys.

383
00:18:27,231 --> 00:18:29,817
No! There is no "us guys."
We basically just met each other.

384
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:34,071
No, Eleanor. You guys have
known each other a really long time.

385
00:18:35,072 --> 00:18:37,491
Also, it doesn't matter
if I told you that or not,

386
00:18:37,574 --> 00:18:40,619
because when Michael finds out
he's failed again, he'll just reboot you.

387
00:18:43,038 --> 00:18:45,082
Chidi, Janet, we're leaving!

388
00:18:47,584 --> 00:18:49,545
I am taking this with me.

389
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:52,923
Oh, no. It's my only copy. Don't.

390
00:18:57,469 --> 00:18:59,388
[Michael] <i>How did it come to this? </i>

391
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:03,559
I was just trying to do something
innovative and different

392
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:08,063
that would improve the way we make
humans' lives miserable for eternity.

393
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:09,314
Hmm. Well...

394
00:19:09,398 --> 00:19:11,567
Shut up. What are my options?

395
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:12,818
Do I have any?

396
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:17,364
I mean, I can't go along with her plan.
It'll be a spectacular failure.

397
00:19:17,447 --> 00:19:20,951
But I can't ignore her,
or she'll rat me out to Shawn.

398
00:19:21,034 --> 00:19:22,035
I'm trapped.

399
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:24,705
You're saying a lot of words right now,

400
00:19:24,788 --> 00:19:29,459
and I only know some of them,
like "rat" and "Jason."

401
00:19:29,543 --> 00:19:32,713
But I know a little wisdom I can give you.

402
00:19:32,796 --> 00:19:35,465
I know everything
that happened in your life,

403
00:19:35,549 --> 00:19:38,427
and it was all stupid,
so I highly doubt that.

404
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:41,930
I was a member of a 60-person dance crew
in Jacksonville.

405
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:46,518
We were called "Dance Dance Resolution:
We Resolve to Dance."

406
00:19:46,602 --> 00:19:49,813
One day, Donkey Doug and I
got into a fight

407
00:19:49,897 --> 00:19:52,774
because I'd framed his girlfriend
for boogie board theft.

408
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:56,695
So he started a new dance crew
called "hashtag DougLife,"

409
00:19:56,778 --> 00:19:59,948
and immediately challenged us
to a dance-off.

410
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:04,161
He said, "Meet us inside the abandoned
orange juice factory at midnight."

411
00:20:04,244 --> 00:20:09,499
That night, as the clock struck 12:00,
me and my crew came together,

412
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:13,795
with a determination
we had never shown before...

413
00:20:15,005 --> 00:20:16,673
and slashed all their tires.

414
00:20:18,258 --> 00:20:19,509
It was dope.

415
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:21,595
The end.

416
00:20:21,678 --> 00:20:23,972
By Jason Mendoza.

417
00:20:24,806 --> 00:20:28,685
You know, that inane story
actually contains a bit of good advice.

418
00:20:28,769 --> 00:20:30,395
Thank you, Jason.

419
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:31,480
You got it, homie.

420
00:20:32,564 --> 00:20:36,610
I give good advice.
Guess that's why I'm in the Good Place.

421
00:20:39,529 --> 00:20:43,742
-Oh! There you guys are.
-No! Stop! No more lies.

422
00:20:43,825 --> 00:20:45,535
Jason, get over here.

423
00:20:45,619 --> 00:20:48,789
[Tahani] That's right. We know his name
is Jason, not Jianyu.

424
00:20:48,872 --> 00:20:50,415
We know everything.

425
00:20:50,499 --> 00:20:53,627
I don't understand much of it,
but, you know, I know it.

426
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:57,172
{\an8}Your sick torture plan
is not working, okay?

427
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:59,258
{\an8}'Cause we keep figuring out
your little puzzle.

428
00:20:59,341 --> 00:21:02,052
{\an8}We're winning, which means you're losing.

429
00:21:02,135 --> 00:21:03,804
{\an8}So you have two choices here, buddy.

430
00:21:03,887 --> 00:21:05,597
{\an8}Keep failing over and over,

431
00:21:05,681 --> 00:21:09,268
{\an8}or realize we're actually the ones
with all the power here.

432
00:21:09,351 --> 00:21:12,354
{\an8}Yeah, no... [sighs]
We're on the same page.

433
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:14,564
{\an8}-What?
-I wanna team up with you guys.

434
00:21:14,648 --> 00:21:16,900
{\an8}What? Why? You do? What?

435
00:21:16,984 --> 00:21:19,778
{\an8}I'm in a bit of a bind,
and I could use some backup.

436
00:21:19,861 --> 00:21:23,657
{\an8}Or, as Jason put it,
I need a new dance crew.

437
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:26,159
{\an8}So, what do you say, new best friends?

438
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:28,287
Stop.
