1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:02,961
This is an exciting day.

2
00:00:03,044 --> 00:00:05,630
We are going to tackle
the trolley problem.

3
00:00:05,714 --> 00:00:07,882
Is this a game?
I go first. I call blue.

4
00:00:07,966 --> 00:00:10,635
There's no... No, this is... No.

5
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:13,221
This is a thought experiment

6
00:00:13,304 --> 00:00:17,851
first introduced by British philosopher
Philippa Foot in 1967.

7
00:00:17,934 --> 00:00:21,896
You are driving a trolley
when the brakes fail.

8
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:27,402
And on the track ahead of you
are five workmen you will run over.

9
00:00:27,485 --> 00:00:31,865
Now, you can steer to another track,
but on that track

10
00:00:31,948 --> 00:00:34,743
is one person you'd kill
instead of the five.

11
00:00:34,826 --> 00:00:36,369
What do you do?

12
00:00:36,453 --> 00:00:37,871
Do we know anything about the people?

13
00:00:37,954 --> 00:00:42,500
Is one of them an ex-boyfriend
or that snooty girl from Rite Aid

14
00:00:42,584 --> 00:00:44,961
who was always silently judging
my purchases?

15
00:00:45,044 --> 00:00:47,422
It's like, "Yeah, chicky!
A Baby Ruth and birth control,

16
00:00:47,505 --> 00:00:49,340
I see the irony. Keep a-swiping!"

17
00:00:49,424 --> 00:00:51,384
You don't know any of the workers.

18
00:00:51,468 --> 00:00:55,055
That's easy. I switch tracks.
Kill one person instead of five.

19
00:00:55,138 --> 00:00:59,017
This is hard. The only trolley I've been
on is James Franco's ironic trolley.

20
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:01,186
It travels backwards
from his penguin grotto

21
00:01:01,269 --> 00:01:03,688
to his garage of adult tricycles.

22
00:01:04,564 --> 00:01:06,149
Um... kill one and save five.

23
00:01:06,232 --> 00:01:08,568
Good! But there's many other versions.

24
00:01:08,651 --> 00:01:12,489
What if you knew one of the people?
Does that change the equation?

25
00:01:12,572 --> 00:01:15,075
What if you're not the driver,
you're just a bystander?

26
00:01:15,158 --> 00:01:17,494
Or let's throw the trolley out altogether.

27
00:01:17,577 --> 00:01:21,956
Let's say you're a doctor
and you can save five patients.

28
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:27,587
But you have to kill one healthy person
and use his organs to do it.

29
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:30,298
-But that's not the same thing.
-Why not?

30
00:01:30,381 --> 00:01:34,803
It's still choosing to kill one person
to save five, isn't it?

31
00:01:34,886 --> 00:01:38,348
Michael. You've been quiet.
What do you think about this?

32
00:01:38,431 --> 00:01:41,559
Well, obviously the dilemma is clear.

33
00:01:41,643 --> 00:01:44,229
How do you kill all six people?

34
00:01:44,312 --> 00:01:46,815
I would dangle a sharp blade
out the window

35
00:01:46,898 --> 00:01:49,609
to slice the neck of the guy
on the other track

36
00:01:49,692 --> 00:01:52,403
as we smoosh our five main guys.

37
00:01:54,864 --> 00:01:58,576
-I did the thing again, didn't I?
-Yeah. Ten more, buddy.

38
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:02,497
People. Good. People...
Why is that so hard to remember?

39
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:04,791
People... What is it?

40
00:02:04,874 --> 00:02:05,708
-Good.
-Good.

41
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:10,672
{\an8}[theme music playing]

42
00:02:13,466 --> 00:02:15,468
Cool. Later, guys.

43
00:02:15,552 --> 00:02:16,678
Oh, hey, twerps.

44
00:02:16,761 --> 00:02:19,973
{\an8}We have an hour before we have to pretend
to be tortured by Vicky.

45
00:02:20,056 --> 00:02:20,974
{\an8}Wanna hang out?

46
00:02:21,057 --> 00:02:23,726
{\an8}We could work on our forced grins.
Check mine out.

47
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:26,938
{\an8}[straining] This place
is miserable, et cetera.

48
00:02:27,021 --> 00:02:29,065
{\an8}-That sounds fun, but...
-Right?

49
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:32,235
{\an8}I'm going to dive
into next week's reading. Sorry.

50
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:35,613
{\an8}-Jason, do you care to join?
-Sure, dawg.

51
00:02:36,197 --> 00:02:37,949
You're doing extra-credit work?

52
00:02:38,032 --> 00:02:40,952
What can I say?
This class is more fun than I thought.

53
00:02:46,124 --> 00:02:50,461
{\an8}Eleanor seemed a little suspicious
earlier, snooping around.

54
00:02:50,545 --> 00:02:52,589
{\an8}You didn't tell her about us, did you?

55
00:02:53,298 --> 00:02:54,173
{\an8}No.

56
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:57,552
{\an8}Why are you scared someone
will know we're pounding it out?

57
00:02:57,635 --> 00:03:01,014
{\an8}Because you refer to lovemaking
as "pounding it out."

58
00:03:01,097 --> 00:03:04,350
{\an8}Who cares what people'd
think about us being together?

59
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:07,770
{\an8}You should talk about this with a friend.

60
00:03:08,771 --> 00:03:10,648
{\an8}But that person would know we're together.

61
00:03:10,732 --> 00:03:11,566
{\an8}Right.

62
00:03:11,649 --> 00:03:15,653
{\an8}You can talk about why you don't
want anyone to know we're together.

63
00:03:15,737 --> 00:03:18,281
{\an8}But that person would know
and I don't want anyone to know.

64
00:03:18,364 --> 00:03:19,365
{\an8}I know.

65
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:22,702
{\an8}You should talk to someone
about how weird it is

66
00:03:22,785 --> 00:03:25,413
you don't want to talk to someone
about how we're together.

67
00:03:27,165 --> 00:03:28,625
How's it going, teach?

68
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:30,627
Hmm. Kitchen looks nice and crazy.

69
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:33,630
I've been racking my brain
for a way to get through to Michael.

70
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:37,383
What do you think about writing
a Kierkegaard rap musical?

71
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:39,761
-I think that's a terrible idea.
-Cool.

72
00:03:42,597 --> 00:03:45,433
Michael won't learn
how to be a good person overnight.

73
00:03:45,516 --> 00:03:46,935
He's not even a person.

74
00:03:47,018 --> 00:03:51,147
He's a bunch of evil
shoved up the butt of an evil mannequin.

75
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:55,526
Teaching him to be good,
it's like teaching me how to be not hot.

76
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:56,819
How would you even do it?

77
00:03:56,903 --> 00:04:00,531
You'd have me hunch or something
and then stand there and say,

78
00:04:00,615 --> 00:04:03,618
"Gurp. Gurp. Gurp."

79
00:04:03,701 --> 00:04:04,661
I don't know.

80
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:07,538
I can't picture it.
I've been hot my whole life.

81
00:04:07,622 --> 00:04:09,290
Sorry, who is this conversation for again?

82
00:04:09,374 --> 00:04:10,250
It's for you.

83
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:12,293
I believe in you, nerd boy.

84
00:04:12,377 --> 00:04:16,839
If you can teach me and Jason ethics,
you can teach anybody.

85
00:04:17,423 --> 00:04:18,383
Thanks.

86
00:04:18,466 --> 00:04:22,220
But definitely a "no" on the rap musical?

87
00:04:22,887 --> 00:04:23,805
If you really think--

88
00:04:23,888 --> 00:04:25,807
<i>♪ My name is Kierkegaard </i>
<i>And my writing is impeccable ♪</i>

89
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:27,976
<i>♪ Check out my teleological suspension </i>
<i>Of the ethical ♪</i>

90
00:04:28,059 --> 00:04:29,727
-No.
-No, right?

91
00:04:29,811 --> 00:04:31,771
[chuckles] It felt like a "no"
when I was doing it.

92
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:35,942
-Janet?
-Hi, there.

93
00:04:36,025 --> 00:04:38,236
If I were to tell you
something personal about myself,

94
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:40,530
-you couldn't tell anyone, right?
-Right.

95
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:42,615
In a way, you're like a therapist?

96
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:46,369
Absolutely not. A therapist is
a trained medical professional

97
00:04:46,452 --> 00:04:50,873
with the ability to absorb and process
complex ideas about human emotion.

98
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:54,669
I am a vessel containing
all of the knowledge in the universe.

99
00:04:54,752 --> 00:04:57,005
Close enough.
Jason and I are sleeping together.

100
00:04:57,088 --> 00:04:59,007
-Okay.
-No one can ever know.

101
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:02,135
I wouldn't shag Jason
if he were the last man on Earth.

102
00:05:02,218 --> 00:05:03,886
But, well, he sort of is.

103
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:06,514
And I am. Shagging him, I mean.

104
00:05:06,597 --> 00:05:08,641
I'm losing my mind.
Please help me.

105
00:05:08,725 --> 00:05:12,854
My job is to make your experience
here in the afterlife more enjoyable.

106
00:05:12,937 --> 00:05:14,355
I will try to help you.

107
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:16,107
I am going to need some time

108
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:19,861
to read every book ever written
about human psychotherapy.

109
00:05:19,944 --> 00:05:22,530
I've done that, so let's begin.
Have a seat.

110
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:27,618
Hi. I'm your therapist, Janet.

111
00:05:28,494 --> 00:05:30,830
[Chidi] I want to chat
about your progress.

112
00:05:30,913 --> 00:05:32,957
In the last homework assignment,

113
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:36,544
I asked you to examine the ethics
of <i>Les Misérables</i>

114
00:05:36,627 --> 00:05:40,089
in which a man steals a loaf of bread
to feed his starving family.

115
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:43,593
Would you please read
your first paragraph?

116
00:05:44,343 --> 00:05:48,222
"Everyone in this story sucks
and belongs in the Bad Place.

117
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:54,604
The thief is bad, the officer chasing him
is bad, all the whiny prostitutes are bad,

118
00:05:54,687 --> 00:05:57,899
plus they're all French, so they're
going to the Bad Place automatically."

119
00:05:57,982 --> 00:06:01,360
Do you see how you're already off-topic?

120
00:06:01,444 --> 00:06:05,615
Chidi, I've been around a long time.
Like, all of it.

121
00:06:05,698 --> 00:06:08,868
I know for a fact
if you steal a loaf of bread,

122
00:06:08,951 --> 00:06:10,870
it's a negative 17 points.

123
00:06:10,953 --> 00:06:14,248
Twenty if it's a baguette,
because that makes you more French.

124
00:06:14,332 --> 00:06:15,792
Okay, sure,

125
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:19,712
but philosophy is about questioning things
you take for granted

126
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:22,048
and I don't think you're doing that.

127
00:06:22,131 --> 00:06:24,258
I mean, "I personally know

128
00:06:24,342 --> 00:06:27,345
Victor Hugo is in the Bad Place,
being tortured.

129
00:06:27,428 --> 00:06:29,347
He's a real wuss, too.

130
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:32,225
If a lava monster
even gets near the guy, he's like,

131
00:06:32,308 --> 00:06:36,354
<i>'Sacrebleu,</i> I peed in m' pants.'"

132
00:06:36,437 --> 00:06:40,358
I don't know what you want from me.
That's exactly what he said.

133
00:06:41,776 --> 00:06:46,697
Jason's a nice person, but my suitors
were always of a certain echelon.

134
00:06:46,781 --> 00:06:48,616
I used what I call the duke rule,

135
00:06:48,699 --> 00:06:52,286
because "duke" is both minimum-acceptable
university and rank of nobility.

136
00:06:52,954 --> 00:06:55,498
You've never dated anyone
like Jason before.

137
00:06:55,581 --> 00:06:57,583
I've dallied below my station.

138
00:06:57,667 --> 00:07:00,628
I had a fling
with a non-famous Hemsworth brother.

139
00:07:00,711 --> 00:07:03,840
But even Larry Hemsworth
had more status than Jason.

140
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:05,842
Jason didn't even have a job.

141
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:08,636
In a sad way, not in the good, rich way.

142
00:07:08,719 --> 00:07:11,013
Hi, guys. What are you doing?

143
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:14,058
Sitting in a room? That's pretty cool.

144
00:07:14,142 --> 00:07:17,478
I took your suggestion. I'm talking
to Janet about our relationship.

145
00:07:17,562 --> 00:07:20,606
Actually, it might help
if I could hear Jason's side as well.

146
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:23,109
No, that'll only slow things down.
I'll tell you his side.

147
00:07:23,192 --> 00:07:26,737
He thinks I have to control everything
and he has no voice in this relationship.

148
00:07:26,821 --> 00:07:29,323
Right, Jason? Good.
Now, where were we?

149
00:07:31,868 --> 00:07:33,202
Just heard that.

150
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:35,371
Okay, fine. I'll leave.

151
00:07:35,997 --> 00:07:40,001
[Chidi] I just don't feel like
you're engaging with the material.

152
00:07:40,084 --> 00:07:42,295
Like with the trolley problem.

153
00:07:42,378 --> 00:07:44,380
That was just tricky, that's all.

154
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:46,340
Why don't you tell me the right answer?

155
00:07:46,424 --> 00:07:48,843
That's what's so great
about the trolley problem,

156
00:07:48,926 --> 00:07:50,887
is that there is no right answer.

157
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:52,013
[groans]

158
00:07:52,096 --> 00:07:55,349
This is why everyone hates
moral philosophy professors.

159
00:07:55,433 --> 00:07:58,227
I'm on your side, dude,
but he is not wrong.

160
00:07:58,311 --> 00:08:01,147
Okay. Michael, trust me.

161
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:06,319
When it comes to human ethics,
I just know more than you.

162
00:08:07,403 --> 00:08:09,739
I've been studying it my whole life.

163
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:11,908
It's just that it's so theoretical.

164
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:17,872
I mean, you know,
maybe there's a more concrete approach.

165
00:08:17,955 --> 00:08:19,957
Here. Let's try this.

166
00:08:21,292 --> 00:08:24,837
Oh, God! Michael, what did you do?

167
00:08:25,463 --> 00:08:27,298
I made the trolley problem real

168
00:08:27,381 --> 00:08:30,259
so we could see how the ethics
would actually play out.

169
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:33,304
There are five workers on this track
and one there.

170
00:08:33,387 --> 00:08:36,599
Here are the levers to switch the tracks.
Make a choice!

171
00:08:36,682 --> 00:08:38,559
The thing is... Ethically speaking--

172
00:08:38,643 --> 00:08:39,936
No time, dude! Make a decision!

173
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:41,020
Well, it's tricky!

174
00:08:41,103 --> 00:08:44,440
On the one hand, if you ascribe
to a purely utilitarian worldview--

175
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:46,651
[brakes squealing]

176
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,072
Okay. So...

177
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:53,699
what did we learn?

178
00:08:56,869 --> 00:08:57,995
Chidi?

179
00:08:58,079 --> 00:08:59,288
Talk it out, buddy.

180
00:09:00,581 --> 00:09:01,707
What are we thinking?

181
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:04,210
He thinks he just killed
a bunch of people with a trolley.

182
00:09:04,293 --> 00:09:07,797
It's just a simulation.
I'd never make you kill real people.

183
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,674
Well, that's reassuring.

184
00:09:09,757 --> 00:09:14,220
Because some of the parts
of the fake people flew into my mouth!

185
00:09:14,303 --> 00:09:16,514
Michael, can we just go
back to the classroom?

186
00:09:16,597 --> 00:09:18,641
We never left. I'll show you.

187
00:09:20,977 --> 00:09:22,853
[sighs]

188
00:09:22,937 --> 00:09:23,896
Yeah.

189
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:25,273
Okay.

190
00:09:25,356 --> 00:09:27,525
See, buddy? None of this was real.

191
00:09:27,608 --> 00:09:31,028
Well, they're fake people,
but their pain is real.

192
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:32,363
Does that make sense?

193
00:09:32,446 --> 00:09:35,199
There have to be stakes
or it's just a thought experiment.

194
00:09:35,283 --> 00:09:36,450
This is awful.

195
00:09:36,534 --> 00:09:38,119
You specifically asked me

196
00:09:38,202 --> 00:09:41,122
if there was a way
I could connect with the material more.

197
00:09:42,206 --> 00:09:44,041
I'm trying, you guys.

198
00:09:46,294 --> 00:09:49,922
Sorry. You're right.
I want to help you understand this.

199
00:09:50,673 --> 00:09:51,882
Thank you, Chidi.

200
00:09:52,675 --> 00:09:54,176
So, let's try again.

201
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:55,303
[wheels clanking]

202
00:09:55,386 --> 00:09:58,139
[stammers] I thought maybe
we would have a discussion.

203
00:09:58,222 --> 00:10:01,309
No, the whole point
is to play out the scenario in real time.

204
00:10:01,392 --> 00:10:02,893
Quick, Chidi! What's your decision?

205
00:10:02,977 --> 00:10:04,312
Okay, I can do this.

206
00:10:04,395 --> 00:10:09,191
I am choosing to switch tracks,
so that way I only kill one person.

207
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:10,359
[Michael] Forgot to tell you,

208
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:13,738
this is the scenario
where you know one of the people.

209
00:10:13,821 --> 00:10:15,531
It's your friend Henry there.

210
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:19,035
-Chidi! How are you, mate?
-Henry! Move!

211
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:20,578
Ah! Nice trolley.

212
00:10:20,661 --> 00:10:22,413
-[Chidi] Move out of the way!
-I can't, Chidi.

213
00:10:22,496 --> 00:10:24,915
-My boots are stuck in the tracks.
-Henry, move!

214
00:10:24,999 --> 00:10:26,459
-Anyway, long time, no--
-Move out of there!

215
00:10:26,542 --> 00:10:28,210
Wait! [screams]

216
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:29,712
Oh, my God!

217
00:10:29,795 --> 00:10:31,547
[brakes squealing]

218
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:33,341
Again, just a simulation.

219
00:10:33,424 --> 00:10:37,053
An almost impossibly lifelike simulation.

220
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:39,597
Would someone's foot
really fly off their body like that?

221
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,057
That was kind of cool.

222
00:10:42,099 --> 00:10:43,517
Ethically speaking.

223
00:10:44,852 --> 00:10:46,479
Tahani's confusing.

224
00:10:46,562 --> 00:10:48,022
She's really smart.

225
00:10:48,105 --> 00:10:51,275
She's all soft and smooth
like a bunch of water balloons.

226
00:10:51,359 --> 00:10:54,445
But I tell her she's pretty
a hundred times a day

227
00:10:54,528 --> 00:10:57,657
and she's never said I'm pretty once.

228
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:59,867
And how does that make you feel?

229
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:01,327
I feel Tahani's embarrassed

230
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:04,372
I'm not some scientist
who forecloses on banks.

231
00:11:04,455 --> 00:11:06,582
-I need another session with Janet.
-[Jason] It's my turn.

232
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:08,542
I have a lot of problems, too.

233
00:11:08,626 --> 00:11:12,254
Perhaps we could kill two birds
with one Janet, as it were.

234
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:14,799
How would you feel about giving
Jason and me couples therapy?

235
00:11:14,882 --> 00:11:16,592
I'd feel great.

236
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:24,058
Janet? What's happening?

237
00:11:24,141 --> 00:11:26,685
Unclear.
My guess is I'm operating in a way

238
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:29,230
I'm not designed for
and it's creating a small glitch.

239
00:11:29,313 --> 00:11:31,565
But if I'm helping you guys, I say,

240
00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:34,318
"What has one thumb
and wants to keep going?

241
00:11:34,402 --> 00:11:35,778
This not-lady."

242
00:11:35,861 --> 00:11:38,739
Eh? Eh?

243
00:11:40,741 --> 00:11:43,953
Okay, so that was trolley problem
version number seven.

244
00:11:44,036 --> 00:11:47,081
Chidi opted to run over
five William Shakespeares

245
00:11:47,164 --> 00:11:50,376
instead of one Santa Claus.

246
00:11:50,459 --> 00:11:53,462
As much as I'm enjoying
watching random people's heads fly off,

247
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:56,590
I think we've taken this trolley thing
as far as it can go.

248
00:11:56,674 --> 00:11:59,593
-You might be right, Eleanor.
-Thank you.

249
00:11:59,677 --> 00:12:01,554
Let's try the doctor one.

250
00:12:02,721 --> 00:12:04,056
Dude! What the fork?

251
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:07,643
[Michael] These five people all need
organ transplants or they will die.

252
00:12:07,726 --> 00:12:09,061
Eleanor's perfectly healthy.

253
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:10,855
Chidi, do you want to slice her open

254
00:12:10,938 --> 00:12:13,023
and use her organs
to save the five sick people?

255
00:12:13,107 --> 00:12:14,608
Chidi, think about this.

256
00:12:14,692 --> 00:12:17,153
I'm your hottest friend. No, Tahani.

257
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:18,988
I'm your nicest... No, Jason.

258
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:20,406
I'm your friend!

259
00:12:20,489 --> 00:12:22,074
[Chidi] I won't do it.

260
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:24,827
As a doctor, I've taken
the Hippocratic oath to do no harm.

261
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:26,370
Although five people will die,

262
00:12:26,454 --> 00:12:30,082
I cannot harm one innocent person
to save them and forsake my oath.

263
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:31,167
It's unethical.

264
00:12:32,626 --> 00:12:34,962
-Okay, tell their families.
-What?

265
00:12:38,966 --> 00:12:40,050
[girl] Doctor Chidi?

266
00:12:40,676 --> 00:12:44,597
My daddy needed a heart transplant.
Did you save his life?

267
00:12:45,181 --> 00:12:46,265
He was working,

268
00:12:46,348 --> 00:12:49,518
then a really bad man
ran him over with a trolley.

269
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:51,937
Oh! Come on!

270
00:12:52,021 --> 00:12:55,065
What? I'm finding this incredibly helpful.

271
00:12:55,149 --> 00:12:57,109
I'm really starting to get it.

272
00:12:57,193 --> 00:12:58,027
I know!

273
00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:00,905
We'll do the one where you're in a boat
next to a volcano

274
00:13:00,988 --> 00:13:05,326
and you can either save 50 people
or one awesome dog or whatever.

275
00:13:05,409 --> 00:13:06,535
No, no, no.

276
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:08,829
Hey! Are you torturing us again?

277
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:10,831
What?

278
00:13:10,915 --> 00:13:12,625
You don't care
about learning ethics lessons.

279
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:14,835
You're just torturing Chidi again,
aren't you?

280
00:13:16,504 --> 00:13:17,671
-Busted.
-What?

281
00:13:17,755 --> 00:13:19,340
[laughs maniacally]

282
00:13:20,758 --> 00:13:21,717
I'm sorry.

283
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,969
Old habits die hard.

284
00:13:24,053 --> 00:13:26,680
Not as hard as those people
you crushed with the trolley, though.

285
00:13:26,764 --> 00:13:29,058
-Boom!
-I'm sorry, is this funny to you?

286
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:31,393
Yeah. I thought that was clear
from my laughter.

287
00:13:32,144 --> 00:13:33,437
Oh, come on.

288
00:13:34,021 --> 00:13:35,064
My bad.

289
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:37,733
I'm still on your team, okay?

290
00:13:37,816 --> 00:13:40,569
I just needed to let off
a little steam. [grunts]

291
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:43,322
See? Back home, all good.

292
00:13:43,405 --> 00:13:45,950
No. No, not all good.

293
00:13:46,033 --> 00:13:49,537
You keep saying we need you
or we'll end up getting tortured forever.

294
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:53,457
But then, when we do help you out,
we still end up getting tortured.

295
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:57,628
I'd rather just be tortured
than choose it.

296
00:13:57,711 --> 00:13:59,505
You are no longer welcome in my class.

297
00:14:00,214 --> 00:14:01,465
Get the fork out!

298
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:08,973
But I said, "My bad."

299
00:14:09,056 --> 00:14:10,349
Out!

300
00:14:12,059 --> 00:14:13,060
[Eleanor] You okay?

301
00:14:13,143 --> 00:14:15,938
You've been staring at the second page
of this book for an hour.

302
00:14:16,021 --> 00:14:17,982
When I'm really upset,

303
00:14:18,065 --> 00:14:21,610
concentrating on a table of contents
helps me calm down.

304
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:25,823
It's like a menu, but the food is words.

305
00:14:25,906 --> 00:14:27,324
Oh. Okay.

306
00:14:27,408 --> 00:14:30,536
I can't believe I actually thought
he wanted to learn from us.

307
00:14:30,619 --> 00:14:32,371
What he really wanted was to torture me.

308
00:14:32,454 --> 00:14:34,415
Using the thing I love most in the world.

309
00:14:34,498 --> 00:14:35,374
Woven belts?

310
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:37,334
Oh! Teaching, right.

311
00:14:38,752 --> 00:14:40,379
I'm sorry about this, Chidi.

312
00:14:40,462 --> 00:14:44,049
I made him take the classes
and I feel a little responsible.

313
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:45,801
No, no, it's not your fault.

314
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:47,595
Yeah, you're right, it isn't,
and no takebacks.

315
00:14:47,678 --> 00:14:49,471
No, a tiger can't change his stripes.

316
00:14:50,222 --> 00:14:51,932
This is what he always wanted.

317
00:14:52,016 --> 00:14:55,936
Me trying desperately to teach him
something he never intended to learn

318
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:57,354
so I'd end up miserable

319
00:14:57,438 --> 00:15:00,941
with my glasses all smudged up
from sweaty forehead stress grease.

320
00:15:01,025 --> 00:15:05,195
Okay. Gross.
Also, I really don't think that's true.

321
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:10,200
No? What possible other reason
could he have to behave that way?

322
00:15:10,284 --> 00:15:13,495
Actually, I can think of one.

323
00:15:14,705 --> 00:15:19,084
Yesterday, Tahani gave us her reasons
not to take this relationship public.

324
00:15:19,168 --> 00:15:23,297
-Tahani, what do you value about Jason?
-Well, he's thoughtful.

325
00:15:24,006 --> 00:15:25,716
Picks flowers and brings them to me.

326
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,510
Often, they're ones
I've just planted, but...

327
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:29,720
That's how I know they're fresh.

328
00:15:29,803 --> 00:15:32,890
He's the least self-aware person
I've ever met.

329
00:15:32,973 --> 00:15:35,684
He has massive amounts
of unearned confidence

330
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:38,979
and he's utterly unaware
of his own absurdity.

331
00:15:39,063 --> 00:15:41,148
Therefore, quite good at sex.

332
00:15:41,231 --> 00:15:45,569
Here's the thing.
I'm nice to you and you're mean to me.

333
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:50,324
There's something wrong about that,
but I can't put my finger on what it is.

334
00:15:50,407 --> 00:15:55,829
Jason, I genuinely like you
but it's hard to change all at once.

335
00:15:55,913 --> 00:15:58,082
Can you give me a little more time?

336
00:15:58,666 --> 00:15:59,625
Okay.

337
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:03,003
I agree to keep this on the DL for now

338
00:16:03,087 --> 00:16:06,131
if you agree to grab my butt in public
once a week.

339
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:10,219
You can say I sat in gum
and you're trying to scrape it off.

340
00:16:10,302 --> 00:16:13,138
You do sit in a lot of gum.

341
00:16:14,098 --> 00:16:16,517
[Janet] Aw. I'm happy for you guys.

342
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:19,311
[retches]

343
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:22,731
[ribbits]

344
00:16:23,857 --> 00:16:25,234
-[ribbits]
-Huh.

345
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:29,947
Look, I don't know what to tell you.
If Chidi can't take a joke, that's on him.

346
00:16:30,531 --> 00:16:33,075
Just like all that blood was.
[chuckles]

347
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:34,618
I can't high-five that!

348
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:37,121
No matter how badly I want to.

349
00:16:37,204 --> 00:16:40,749
Look, this isn't about Chidi
not being able to take a joke.

350
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:41,959
This is about you.

351
00:16:42,042 --> 00:16:46,005
You're doing what I used to do.
You're pulling an Eleanor.

352
00:16:46,588 --> 00:16:50,426
Posting my cousin's credit card number
on Reddit because she said I looked tired?

353
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:52,428
[both chuckle]

354
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:53,804
I forgot I did that.

355
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,265
No. No.

356
00:16:56,348 --> 00:17:00,352
Pulling an Eleanor in this case is
lashing out when you feel like a failure.

357
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:02,312
You couldn't hack the classes.

358
00:17:02,396 --> 00:17:05,482
They made you feel dumb and small,
so you took it out on the teacher.

359
00:17:05,566 --> 00:17:07,943
You think I feel dumb and small?

360
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:11,280
I'm an eternal being
who can see in nine dimensions.

361
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:12,614
I can see from your aura

362
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:15,159
you're about to fart quietly
then lie about it.

363
00:17:15,242 --> 00:17:18,037
And please don't,
because I can also see what you ate today.

364
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:20,456
Dude, you can bluster
and insult all you want.

365
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:22,708
Also classic Shellstrop moves, by the way.

366
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:24,793
But deep down, you know I'm right.

367
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:25,836
Whatever.

368
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:28,047
Eventually Chidi will get over it.

369
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:31,884
[chuckles] Leaving it up to
the other person to be the grown-up.

370
00:17:31,967 --> 00:17:34,470
Yet another classic Shellstrop move.

371
00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:36,472
You and I are really very similar.

372
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:38,515
What does that say about me?

373
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:43,270
Look, bro, it's 100% on you
to make this up to him.

374
00:17:47,191 --> 00:17:48,358
[Michael] <i>I screwed up.</i>

375
00:17:49,151 --> 00:17:52,738
I'm owning it.
I mean, I'm a superior being.

376
00:17:52,821 --> 00:17:54,406
I ought to act like one. Right?

377
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:57,743
So, I really thought
about each one of you,

378
00:17:57,826 --> 00:18:00,370
and I got you something
that will make you happy.

379
00:18:00,454 --> 00:18:03,624
I call them "opposite tortures."

380
00:18:03,707 --> 00:18:06,668
-Do you mean "presents"?
-That's better. Thank you.

381
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:08,462
Tahani, here's yours.

382
00:18:10,214 --> 00:18:11,632
Holy mama!

383
00:18:12,633 --> 00:18:14,134
Is this a diamond?

384
00:18:14,218 --> 00:18:16,762
Yeah. Honestly, I don't get the appeal.

385
00:18:16,845 --> 00:18:21,433
Diamonds are literally carbon molecules
lined up in the most boring way.

386
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:23,227
They're worthless space garbage.

387
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:26,480
What you're holding right now,
that's basically meteorite poop.

388
00:18:27,064 --> 00:18:28,357
And I have the biggest piece!

389
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:34,363
Eleanor, I had Janet make you
a never-ending shrimp dispensary.

390
00:18:35,322 --> 00:18:36,698
[Eleanor gasps]

391
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:38,367
[Michael laughs]

392
00:18:39,159 --> 00:18:41,370
[exclaims loudly]

393
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:44,414
This is the dream.

394
00:18:44,498 --> 00:18:46,416
-It is?
-Yeah.

395
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,836
Jason, here you go.

396
00:18:49,837 --> 00:18:52,548
[gasps] Pikachu! Guys, it's Pikachu!

397
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:54,007
This is awesome.

398
00:18:56,176 --> 00:18:57,678
Aw, man.

399
00:18:58,303 --> 00:19:00,472
And, finally, Chidi.

400
00:19:00,556 --> 00:19:04,059
You were a tough nut to crack,
but I think I figured it out.

401
00:19:07,271 --> 00:19:12,985
This is a replica of a lost notebook
from the desk of Immanuel Kant.

402
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:18,740
It contains never-before-seen thoughts
and musings and several...

403
00:19:20,033 --> 00:19:21,702
crude, erotic doodles.

404
00:19:21,785 --> 00:19:23,162
Interesting guy, actually.

405
00:19:23,912 --> 00:19:28,792
The point is no one on Earth
has ever seen this, except for you.

406
00:19:29,585 --> 00:19:30,586
Cool.

407
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:35,674
This isn't an apology.
It's a bribe and I'm not interested.

408
00:19:35,757 --> 00:19:37,259
Yeah, we can't be bought!

409
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:38,635
What do you want from me, man?

410
00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:42,181
You want me to give you
a golden nameplate for your office?

411
00:19:42,264 --> 00:19:44,391
Or you want a diamond
bigger than Tahani's?

412
00:19:44,474 --> 00:19:47,227
No! Then this would be worthless.

413
00:19:47,311 --> 00:19:48,478
I don't want anything.

414
00:19:48,562 --> 00:19:51,815
Oh... Okay. I get it.

415
00:19:51,899 --> 00:19:54,318
I get it.
You want me to admit I was wrong.

416
00:19:54,401 --> 00:19:57,613
You want me to say, "Chidi, I'm so sorry,

417
00:19:57,696 --> 00:20:00,699
because I didn't understand human ethics
and you do.

418
00:20:00,782 --> 00:20:03,744
It made me feel insecure and I lashed out.

419
00:20:03,827 --> 00:20:08,540
And please help me, because I feel
so, so lost and vulnerable."

420
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:11,627
Yes.

421
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:18,425
Oh, Chidi, I'm so sorry.

422
00:20:18,508 --> 00:20:22,346
I didn't understand human ethics
and you do.

423
00:20:22,429 --> 00:20:26,308
And it made me feel insecure
and I lashed out.

424
00:20:27,643 --> 00:20:33,232
And I really need your help,
because I feel so lost and vulnerable.

425
00:20:35,567 --> 00:20:36,485
Have a seat.

426
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:38,070
[sniffles]

427
00:20:42,324 --> 00:20:43,242
Whoo!

428
00:20:43,992 --> 00:20:45,702
Nobody try "mystery flavor."

429
00:20:45,786 --> 00:20:48,038
It's white chocolate and it is nasty.

430
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:55,045
Listen, we just wanted to thank you
for all of your help.

431
00:20:55,128 --> 00:20:58,006
{\an8}Our relationship's grown so much stronger
over the past few weeks

432
00:20:58,090 --> 00:20:59,174
{\an8}and we owe it all to you.

433
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:02,844
{\an8}Congratulations.
I am very happy for the both of you.

434
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:04,930
{\an8}[rumbling and crashing]

435
00:21:06,056 --> 00:21:07,557
{\an8}Okay, bye!

436
00:21:15,399 --> 00:21:16,400
{\an8}Hi, there.

437
00:21:16,483 --> 00:21:18,151
{\an8}What's happening? What's wrong?

438
00:21:18,235 --> 00:21:22,239
{\an8}I am wrong. I can't stop glitching.
I don't know why and it's getting worse.

439
00:21:22,322 --> 00:21:26,285
{\an8}I fear this neighborhood
is in danger of total collapse.

440
00:21:26,368 --> 00:21:29,204
So that's the main thing. How are you?
