1
00:00:13,096 --> 00:00:14,347
[Eleanor] You all right, chief?

2
00:00:14,431 --> 00:00:16,766
You look like you lost
your lucky bookmark.

3
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:17,892
Oh, no! Did I?

4
00:00:18,852 --> 00:00:21,938
[chuckles] It's fine. I got it right here.

5
00:00:22,021 --> 00:00:25,316
It's just that
now that we're actually on the train,

6
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:27,402
heading to Bad Place headquarters,

7
00:00:27,485 --> 00:00:31,740
this plan is starting to feel slightly...
completely insane.

8
00:00:31,823 --> 00:00:35,452
-This is the only way to get to the Judge?
-I'm afraid so, yes.

9
00:00:35,535 --> 00:00:38,329
{\an8}See, the Judge exists
in a sort of neutral zone,

10
00:00:38,413 --> 00:00:40,540
separate from the Good Place
and the Bad Place.

11
00:00:40,623 --> 00:00:43,168
The only things there
are the Judge's quarters,

12
00:00:43,251 --> 00:00:46,212
the accounting department
and the Janet Warehouse.

13
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:48,882
No, there's also an IHOP.

14
00:00:48,965 --> 00:00:51,760
Oh! I'm gonna order
the Rooty Tooty Fresh 'N Fruity!

15
00:00:51,843 --> 00:00:57,223
No, sorry, in this realm, IHOP stands for
"Interdimensional Hole of Pancakes."

16
00:00:57,307 --> 00:01:01,770
You don't really eat these pancakes.
It's more like they eat you.

17
00:01:01,853 --> 00:01:03,646
Okay. I'll get eggs, then.

18
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:07,233
So, the only way to get to the Judge
is through a portal,

19
00:01:07,317 --> 00:01:11,488
{\an8}which is smack dab in the middle of
the main office at Bad Place headquarters.

20
00:01:11,571 --> 00:01:14,407
{\an8}And the only way through the portal
is with one of these.

21
00:01:14,491 --> 00:01:17,535
What is that? Is that jewelry?
Not that it matters.

22
00:01:17,619 --> 00:01:20,580
It's just some jewelry I don't have.
[chuckles] Can I have it?

23
00:01:20,663 --> 00:01:24,918
These pins are hard to come by.
Only upper management-types have them.

24
00:01:25,001 --> 00:01:27,670
So, you guys will lay low
while I get us four more.

25
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:31,800
Janet doesn't need one because,
for portals, she counts as a carry-on.

26
00:01:31,883 --> 00:01:33,218
I'm luggage.

27
00:01:33,301 --> 00:01:36,763
I had Janet make you each
a Bad Place disguise.

28
00:01:36,846 --> 00:01:38,848
And everyone who worked
in the neighborhood

29
00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:41,017
has been sent back
to their previous departments.

30
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:43,895
So the chances of you
being recognized are very small.

31
00:01:43,978 --> 00:01:47,273
I don't know. This plan seems complicated.

32
00:01:47,357 --> 00:01:50,193
To be fair, you once said that
about an orange.

33
00:01:50,276 --> 00:01:51,820
They don't make sense.

34
00:01:51,903 --> 00:01:55,740
Apples, you eat their clothes,
but oranges, you don't?

35
00:01:55,824 --> 00:01:56,699
Forget this plan.

36
00:01:56,783 --> 00:02:00,411
I say we huck a Molotov cocktail
and [whooshes] run through the portal.

37
00:02:00,495 --> 00:02:02,789
I think we should go with Michael's plan.

38
00:02:02,872 --> 00:02:05,250
I'm telling you, Molotov cocktails work.

39
00:02:05,333 --> 00:02:08,169
Any time I had a problem,
and I threw a Molotov cocktail...

40
00:02:08,253 --> 00:02:11,339
Boom, right away,
I had a different problem.

41
00:02:11,422 --> 00:02:13,466
He makes a strong case.

42
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:15,552
[theme music playing]

43
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:23,560
Okay, now you're all gonna need aliases.

44
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:26,729
{\an8}Cool. I'm gonna be Diana Tremaine.

45
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:28,606
{\an8}That was the name on my fake ID
in high school.

46
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:33,486
{\an8}[chuckles] Her address was
123 Whatever Street, Canada City, Canada.

47
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:35,363
{\an8}Arizona bouncers are the best.

48
00:02:35,446 --> 00:02:37,991
{\an8}Character work. Such fun.

49
00:02:38,074 --> 00:02:40,785
{\an8}I dabbled in a bit of acting
after university.

50
00:02:40,869 --> 00:02:44,956
{\an8}Mostly, I just stood around
while Baz Luhrmann threw glitter on me.

51
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:49,043
{\an8}I shall be Rhonda Mumps,
and I work down at the hot dog factory.

52
00:02:49,127 --> 00:02:50,670
{\an8}You need to be specific.

53
00:02:50,753 --> 00:02:52,964
{\an8}There are nine
Hot Dog Torture Departments.

54
00:02:53,047 --> 00:02:56,634
{\an8}Making people into,
stuffing people with...

55
00:02:56,718 --> 00:03:00,930
{\an8}Stuffing people sounds fun.
Is that shoving them into vegan's throats?

56
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:03,182
{\an8}Yes... throats.

57
00:03:03,266 --> 00:03:07,020
{\an8}-I know what my secret identity is.
-You can't be Blake Bortles.

58
00:03:07,103 --> 00:03:10,106
{\an8}-Fine. Then I'll be Jake.
-Don't say "Jortles."

59
00:03:10,189 --> 00:03:13,276
{\an8}Jortles! I work
in the Molotov Cocktail Department.

60
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:16,195
{\an8}I thought you would be
more worried about this.

61
00:03:16,279 --> 00:03:18,865
{\an8}We've been knee-deep in demons
for 800 reboots now.

62
00:03:18,948 --> 00:03:21,784
-Lying about who we are is second nature.
-[Michael] Huh.

63
00:03:23,328 --> 00:03:25,788
-Chidi?
-I hate this. I hate lying.

64
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:28,166
-It's not permissible. I can't do this.
-[Michael] Oh, boy.

65
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:34,714
Jeez Louise. Looks like Chidi has
a real case of the Mondays, am I right?

66
00:03:34,797 --> 00:03:37,717
[chuckles] Hey, pass the Nascar ketchup.

67
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:41,471
Hey, buddy.

68
00:03:42,305 --> 00:03:43,973
Look, if you don't wanna lie

69
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:47,435
because it conflicts
with your moral principles, I get it.

70
00:03:48,269 --> 00:03:50,605
-No one's gonna be mad at you.
-Really?

71
00:03:50,688 --> 00:03:54,108
No, dumbass! I'm lying to you
to make you feel better.

72
00:03:54,192 --> 00:03:55,443
See? Sometimes lying is awesome.

73
00:03:55,526 --> 00:03:59,572
[gasps] Plus, I said "dumbass."
Oh, cursing, how I've missed you.

74
00:03:59,656 --> 00:04:02,408
Look, Eleanor, our goal here is to appear

75
00:04:02,492 --> 00:04:05,328
in front of a Judge
who is going to judge us.

76
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:08,081
What if I lie down here
and I lose 12 points,

77
00:04:08,164 --> 00:04:10,333
then in front of the Judge
I'm 12 points short?

78
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:14,420
What if the Judge doesn't take our case
because we lied to get there?

79
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:18,091
Kant says that lying is always wrong.
I follow that maxim.

80
00:04:18,174 --> 00:04:19,717
You can't even lie to demons?

81
00:04:19,801 --> 00:04:22,178
They're trying to torture us!
We're behind enemy lines!

82
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:23,930
Principles aren't principles

83
00:04:24,013 --> 00:04:27,225
when you pick and choose
when you're gonna follow them.

84
00:04:27,308 --> 00:04:29,394
I won't lie about who I am.

85
00:04:30,812 --> 00:04:31,813
Okay.

86
00:04:33,856 --> 00:04:36,484
I understand and am cool with it.

87
00:04:36,567 --> 00:04:39,487
-You're lying, aren't you?
-Yes. I wanna strangle you.

88
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:44,575
What even is this thing?

89
00:04:45,535 --> 00:04:46,953
I hate suits.

90
00:04:47,036 --> 00:04:49,914
They remind me of court,
and going to court,

91
00:04:49,998 --> 00:04:53,793
and being my own lawyer against
the advice of the judge in court,

92
00:04:53,876 --> 00:04:55,920
and getting immediately convicted.

93
00:04:56,004 --> 00:04:57,588
I think you look nice.

94
00:04:57,672 --> 00:04:59,424
I think you look sexy.

95
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:03,136
Here. I got you this
to help your disguise.

96
00:05:03,219 --> 00:05:05,013
Whoa, a briefcase?

97
00:05:06,097 --> 00:05:07,432
Take my credit card to the hedge fund.

98
00:05:07,515 --> 00:05:08,850
I'll meet you at the martini store.

99
00:05:08,933 --> 00:05:09,767
Oh, you're gonna get caught.

100
00:05:09,851 --> 00:05:11,019
Give me the briefcase back. Thanks.

101
00:05:11,102 --> 00:05:12,020
Aw.

102
00:05:12,103 --> 00:05:14,856
Janet, you need to get in character, too.

103
00:05:14,939 --> 00:05:18,568
I know you look like a Bad Janet,
but can you act like one?

104
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:20,570
I've gained new skills recently.

105
00:05:20,653 --> 00:05:22,322
I learned how to be passive-aggressive.

106
00:05:22,405 --> 00:05:24,324
Totally fine
that you guys haven't noticed.

107
00:05:24,407 --> 00:05:25,366
Oh.

108
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:27,410
-[stutters] Let's practice.
-Okay.

109
00:05:27,493 --> 00:05:28,911
I'll make a request,

110
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:31,873
and you give me
that patented Bad Janet attitude.

111
00:05:31,956 --> 00:05:34,250
-Can I have a glass of water?
-Here you go.

112
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:37,587
No. Let's try again. Be mean.

113
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:40,673
Bad Janet, can I have a glass of water?

114
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:46,846
[straining] No. I would never
give you that, you... dumb person.

115
00:05:46,929 --> 00:05:48,056
What's behind you?

116
00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:49,348
-Nothing.
-Give it to me.

117
00:05:49,432 --> 00:05:51,642
-It's a glass of water.
-Oh.

118
00:05:51,726 --> 00:05:53,144
-And a backup glass. Oh, boy.
-Oh, boy.

119
00:05:53,227 --> 00:05:54,312
Oh.

120
00:05:54,395 --> 00:05:57,273
-It's okay, we'll keep working.
-Okay.

121
00:05:57,356 --> 00:06:00,068
-[rails screeching]
-We're here.

122
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:04,697
[announcer] <i>All trains today</i>
<i>are delayed by three hours.</i>

123

Keep walking. Keep your heads down.

126
00:06:17,168 --> 00:06:19,545
Just act unnatural.

127
00:06:22,256 --> 00:06:25,927
Hey, guys. Wait here while I go
get us some more of these pins.

128
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:28,054
-But what is this place?
-It's just a place.

129
00:06:28,137 --> 00:06:31,516
An area or location.
It's pretty straightforward.

130
00:06:31,599 --> 00:06:34,644
-"The Museum of Human Misery"?
-[Michael] Oh, yeah.

131
00:06:34,727 --> 00:06:36,270
It's a torture museum.

132
00:06:36,354 --> 00:06:38,481
Famous examples of bad behavior

133
00:06:38,564 --> 00:06:40,525
and explanations
of the torture they earned.

134
00:06:40,608 --> 00:06:43,152
-Is there a gift shop?
-Jason, this is hell.

135
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:44,112
Of course there's a gift shop.

136
00:06:44,946 --> 00:06:49,742
It's the least horrifying room.
It's the Hall of Low-Grade Crappiness.

137
00:06:51,577 --> 00:06:54,705
"First person to floss
in an open-plan office"?

138
00:06:58,501 --> 00:07:01,170
Well, she deserves to be tortured.
She's a monster.

139
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:03,089
This was the safest place
I could think of.

140
00:07:03,172 --> 00:07:04,715
No one ever comes in here.

141
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:07,009
Guys, if you do leave this room

142
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:10,054
you'll see things
that will haunt you for eternity.

143
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:12,557
Okay, back soon. Bye.

144
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:15,560
Hey, hey! Be careful. Okay?

145
00:07:17,061 --> 00:07:18,646
"Be careful"?

146
00:07:18,729 --> 00:07:19,605
Yeah.

147
00:07:20,189 --> 00:07:22,900
Oh, Eleanor, are you worried about me?

148
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:25,361
Yeah, I'm worried.

149
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:28,072
'Cause you're
our ticket out of here, genius.

150
00:07:28,156 --> 00:07:30,116
Don't go getting all goopy on me.

151
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:32,702
-Worry about them. I'll be fine.
-Okay.

152
00:07:34,162 --> 00:07:35,580

[animatronic man] Heh. Heh. Heh.

[Petruchio] All right,
we've got a lot of work to do.

161
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:09,447
Why don't you set up the bar
over by that wall?

162
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:13,826
Why don't you roll off your mom
and do it yourself, you fat dink?

164

00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:27,340
Still happy I can swear now,

168
00:08:27,423 --> 00:08:30,343
but everything else about this
is very bad.

169
00:08:31,427 --> 00:08:33,221
[indistinct chatter]

170
00:08:34,472 --> 00:08:36,390
Hey, boss. I'm back.

171
00:08:36,474 --> 00:08:38,017
Welcome home. Axe up.

172
00:08:38,809 --> 00:08:42,146
Ow! New scent. "Transformers."

173
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:45,691
Yes. It makes you smell how
<i>Transformers</i> movies make you feel.

174
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:49,737
Still can't believe those jack-offs
got away. Really zips my tip.

175
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:50,947
-Yeah.
-Anyway,

176
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:54,450
I drew up some extradition papers
to get them back from Mindy's.

177
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:57,078
I'll take a few of my most trusted staff,

178
00:08:57,161 --> 00:09:00,414
hop in the portal,
file those with the Judge,

179
00:09:00,498 --> 00:09:03,668
quick stop for pancakes,
and then I'll head on back.

180
00:09:03,751 --> 00:09:07,338
By the way, I'm gonna need four pins
for my crew.

181
00:09:07,421 --> 00:09:10,007
This is very thorough. However...

182
00:09:11,175 --> 00:09:15,012
Is that where we're putting
top priority files nowadays?

183
00:09:15,096 --> 00:09:16,681
We won't need extradition papers.

184
00:09:16,764 --> 00:09:21,060
Plans are already in motion to get
the humans back in a different way.

185
00:09:21,143 --> 00:09:22,436
Ah.

186
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,188
[instrumental music playing]

187
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:32,405
Oh, man, this is not good.
This is not good!

188
00:09:32,488 --> 00:09:35,783
We can't stand here in a group.
Looks too conspicuous.

189
00:09:35,866 --> 00:09:38,202
I'll go with Tahani.
Chidi, go with Jason.

190
00:09:38,286 --> 00:09:41,414
Jason's unearned confidence
lets him do all the talking

191
00:09:41,497 --> 00:09:43,499
and you don't have to lie. Okay?

192
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:44,875
Come on, Diana, let's hit the bar.

193
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:47,962
I'm gonna get me a tall glass
of pipin' hot corn syrup

194
00:09:48,045 --> 00:09:50,673
and a scooter,
so I can roll around the mall.

195
00:09:50,756 --> 00:09:52,341
-[whispering] That's really good.
-Thank you.

196
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:55,845
-Hors d'oeuvre?
-Oh, what do you got?

197
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:58,014
Soul food from Maine,
bagels from Arkansas,

198
00:09:58,097 --> 00:10:00,057
Hawaiian pizza, of course,

199
00:10:00,141 --> 00:10:02,768
and egg salad from a hospital
vending machine in Azerbaijan.

200
00:10:02,852 --> 00:10:05,396
-That.
-Have a terrible evening.

201
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:09,025
No way! Trent? Is that you?

202
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:11,110
Uh, who else could it be?

203
00:10:11,193 --> 00:10:14,447
Come on, tap it out. Boom, boom.

204
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:16,032
What's up? I'm Chet.

205
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:18,826
Jake is my name,
Molotov cocktails is my game.

206
00:10:18,909 --> 00:10:22,830
I think school is lame.
I got a tattoo of David Blaine! What!

207
00:10:22,913 --> 00:10:25,916
Whoo! Tight! Ball tap! [laughs]

208
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,252
-Dip! Ball tap!
-Ow!

209
00:10:28,336 --> 00:10:30,254
That's a firm ball tap, bro.

210
00:10:30,338 --> 00:10:34,425
Anyway, your boy Trent and I worked
together in Partial Decapitations.

211
00:10:34,508 --> 00:10:38,012
-When did you leave Decap? 800 years ago?
-Something like that.

212
00:10:38,095 --> 00:10:41,015
I just joined a new department,
Toxic Masculinity.

213
00:10:41,098 --> 00:10:42,933
We torture Internet trolls, frat dudes.

214
00:10:43,017 --> 00:10:44,852
It actually started as a training program

215
00:10:44,935 --> 00:10:46,812
to prep for when
the Girls Gone Wild dude gets here.

216
00:10:46,896 --> 00:10:48,147
-Joe Francis?
-The one.

217
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:49,357
Legend!

218
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,652
[chuckles] Bro-hams, get over here
and meet my top dog, Trent.

219
00:10:52,735 --> 00:10:54,612
Dude's a straight beast
when it comes to torture.

220
00:10:54,695 --> 00:10:55,946
-'Sup, bro?
-'Sup, bro?

221
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:58,616
It's pretty choice
that we're running into you right now.

222
00:10:58,699 --> 00:11:01,786
My top dog, Dirk, here,
he got stuck with a new case.

223
00:11:01,869 --> 00:11:04,163
He can't crack it.
Hit 'em with it, D-money.

224
00:11:04,246 --> 00:11:08,501
I'm trying to torture this guy, Brant.
Brant was a total lord.

225
00:11:08,584 --> 00:11:10,670
He got kicked off of
Rob Gronkowski's party cruise

226
00:11:10,753 --> 00:11:12,213
for throwing a lobster at a stripper,

227
00:11:12,296 --> 00:11:15,841
and then he died doing a keg stand
in the back of a moving Jeep Wrangler.

228
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:18,594
Anyways, we run
a couple hundred torture scenarios.

229
00:11:18,677 --> 00:11:22,014
None of them seemed quite right.
Think we can get you to crack this nut?

230
00:11:22,098 --> 00:11:24,892
-Well, how can I say no?
-[all laughing]

231
00:11:24,975 --> 00:11:28,187
Yeah, I know how I would say no.
I'd be all like, "No!"

232
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:29,480
But I can't.

233
00:11:29,563 --> 00:11:31,982
You're so weird, Trent, man.
You're always so weird.

234
00:11:32,066 --> 00:11:33,776
-Yeah.
-I love that about you.

235
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:36,654
Don't get me wrong,
I love shoving hot dogs into people,

236
00:11:36,737 --> 00:11:38,197
but once you've dogged every hole,

237
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:40,199
you just start to feel like
you're repeating yourself.

238
00:11:40,282 --> 00:11:41,617
I hear that, sister.

239
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:43,494
I'm gonna go take a dump.
You want me to grab you one?

240
00:11:43,577 --> 00:11:45,621
-Nah, I'm good, thanks.
-Not even a little nugg?

241
00:11:45,704 --> 00:11:47,331
-Nah, I'm a'ight.
-All right.

242
00:11:47,415 --> 00:11:48,874
Damn, you're good at this.

243
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:51,877
Hang out with Johnny Depp enough,
you become pretty good at lying.

244
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:55,965
Like, "No, your whole thing
isn't exhausting at all!"

245
00:11:56,048 --> 00:12:00,052
Hi, there...
you big, stinky, poop-face guys.

246
00:12:00,136 --> 00:12:00,970
It's me, Good Janet.

247
00:12:01,053 --> 00:12:03,055
I'm sorry I called you
big, stinky, poop-face guys.

248
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:05,766
That's okay.
Can you dig around a little bit

249
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:09,520
and find out what this event is
and how long it's gonna last?

250
00:12:09,603 --> 00:12:10,521
I'd love to.

251
00:12:10,604 --> 00:12:13,607
Punch your... teeth!

252
00:12:13,691 --> 00:12:16,152
Hey. Hi. Teeth. Ugh.

253
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:19,238
[Michael] What's all this?

254
00:12:19,321 --> 00:12:23,033
I was going to try to get the humans back
by going through the proper channels.

255
00:12:23,117 --> 00:12:26,495
But then I remembered...
I'm a naughty bitch.

256
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:27,872
[all chuckle]

257
00:12:27,955 --> 00:12:31,000
So, I sent a black ops team to Mindy's,
to extract them.

258
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:34,086
Nobody from the Bad Place is allowed
in Mindy's neighborhood.

259
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:36,589
You can't do that, Shawn. It's illegal.

260
00:12:36,672 --> 00:12:39,216
Oh, no.
Guys, Michael says this is illegal.

261
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:41,260
I hadn't thought of that.

262
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:42,720
[all laughing]

263
00:12:42,803 --> 00:12:44,972
That was sarcasm.
I had thought of that.

264
00:12:45,055 --> 00:12:47,266
Listen, your experiment
blew up in our faces.

265
00:12:47,349 --> 00:12:50,311
The example I made of Vicky ensured
everybody kept their mouths shut,

266
00:12:50,394 --> 00:12:53,022
but we're not out of the woods
until those four are back in custody.

267
00:12:53,105 --> 00:12:56,859
I rounded up some loyal friends
and took matters into my own hands.

268
00:12:56,942 --> 00:13:01,322
Relax, Mike. This will all be over soon
and we can all head down to the museum.

269
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:03,657
The museum?

270
00:13:03,741 --> 00:13:08,954
Yes. Your neighborhood, our neighborhood,
is being immortalized for its success.

271
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:10,080
It's all gonna work out.

272
00:13:10,164 --> 00:13:14,919
I took the form of a 45-year-old white man
for a reason. I can only fail up.

273
00:13:15,002 --> 00:13:18,130
-[alarm blaring]
-The team is in place. Let's do this.

274
00:13:19,673 --> 00:13:24,053
Hey! So, those bro demons over there
think I'm some kind of great torturer,

275
00:13:24,136 --> 00:13:26,222
and they want my advice
on how to torture someone.

276
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:29,517
Jason is stalling by ranking
MMA ring girls with them,

277
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,643
but I have to do something.

278
00:13:30,726 --> 00:13:33,187
Eleanor, you're wearing glasses now.
Help me!

279
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:36,190
You know the answer, dude.
Lie your ass off.

280
00:13:36,273 --> 00:13:38,025
If Rhonda can do it, you can.

281
00:13:38,108 --> 00:13:39,235
I once shoved a hot dog

282
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:42,112
right down the throat
of the legendary John Wayne.

283
00:13:42,696 --> 00:13:44,073
She even name-drops in hell.

284
00:13:44,156 --> 00:13:46,242
I told you, lies have consequences!

285
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:48,410
I will have contributed
to someone's eternal torture,

286
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:51,497
because I disobeyed
a basic Kantian moral principle.

287
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:52,706
I'm gonna be sick.

288
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:54,124
I don't wanna go back to the bathroom.

289
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:55,376
They put mirrors in the toilet.

290
00:13:55,459 --> 00:13:56,919
That makes you really confront
what you're doing!

291
00:13:57,002 --> 00:13:58,629
Okay, okay. Sit down.

292
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:01,882
-Take a breath. Rub your lucky bookmark.
-[breathes heavily]

293
00:14:01,966 --> 00:14:03,425
Hear me out.

294
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:07,388
What if lying is ethical
in this situation?

295
00:14:07,471 --> 00:14:12,434
What if certain actions aren't universally
good or bad, like Jonathan Dancy says?

296
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:16,897
Jonathan Dancy?
Are you talking about moral particularism?

297
00:14:16,981 --> 00:14:18,190
We never covered that.

298
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:21,360
-You read on your own?
-[scoffs]

299
00:14:21,443 --> 00:14:23,070
You think just because
I'm a straight hottie

300
00:14:23,153 --> 00:14:24,655
I can't read philosophy for fun?

301
00:14:24,738 --> 00:14:27,449
-I--
-Look, moral particularism says

302
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:31,579
there are no fixed rules
that work in every situation.

303
00:14:31,662 --> 00:14:34,290
Let's say you promised your friend
you'd go to the movies,

304
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:37,001
but then your mom
suddenly gets rushed to the ER.

305
00:14:37,084 --> 00:14:38,627
Your boy, Kant, would say,

306
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:41,797
"Never break a promise.
Go see <i>Chronicles of Riddick.</i>

307
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:43,215
Doesn't matter if your mom gets lonely

308
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:45,634
and steals a bucket of Vicodin
from the nurse's closet."

309
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:46,886
-Real example?
-Yep.

310
00:14:46,969 --> 00:14:51,515
But a moral particularist like me...
I'm one now. I just decided.

311
00:14:51,599 --> 00:14:54,101
Would say, "There's no absolute rule.

312
00:14:54,184 --> 00:14:58,105
You have to choose your actions
based on the particular situation."

313
00:14:58,188 --> 00:15:01,150
Right now,
we are in a pretty bonkers situation.

314
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:04,236
I don't think I can change what I believe
just like that.

315
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:08,490
And I didn't think I would ever be
at a cocktail party in literal hell

316
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:11,702
lecturing my teacher/ex-lover
about moral particularism,

317
00:15:11,785 --> 00:15:13,454
but life throws you curveballs, bro!

318
00:15:13,537 --> 00:15:14,914
And need I remind you,

319
00:15:14,997 --> 00:15:17,207
it was doing things your way
that made you end up here.

320
00:15:18,292 --> 00:15:20,628
Man! Get back over there, dog!

321
00:15:20,711 --> 00:15:23,756
[sniffs] Damn. You got that good stank.

322
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:25,341
Thanks. Back at you, bud.

323
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:27,051
Smash you later. Let's roll.

324
00:15:28,552 --> 00:15:30,179
[indistinct chatter]

325
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:37,811
Hey, butt... Ass!

326
00:15:37,895 --> 00:15:39,355
Butt-ass.

327
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:42,149
How long is this stupid event
supposed to last anyway?

328
00:15:42,232 --> 00:15:43,692
They're unveiling the exhibit
in ten minutes,

329
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:44,693
then everyone'll get drunk

330
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:45,986
and poke each other with hot sticks,

331
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:47,154
and then it'll be over.

332
00:15:47,738 --> 00:15:48,739
Farts.

333
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:53,911
Uh-oh.

334
00:15:54,578 --> 00:15:56,664
[Shawn] Bad Janet? Walkie-talkie mode.

335
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:58,791
[electronic beep]

336
00:15:58,874 --> 00:16:00,668
[operative]<i> Now entering </i>
<i>Mindy St. Claire's house.</i>

337
00:16:00,751 --> 00:16:03,879
[laughs] This is so exciting!
I hope everyone gets hurt!

338
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:05,547
<i>Living room is clear. </i>
<i>Entering the bedroom.</i>

339
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:07,633

-[Mindy] <i>Oh!</i>

<i>Wait! Whoa, whoa, whoa! Who are you guys?</i>

343
00:16:14,932 --> 00:16:17,267
[Derek] <i>Oh, friends! Hi, I'm Derek.</i>

344
00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:20,771
Where are the humans?
And who is Derek?

345
00:16:20,854 --> 00:16:23,941
<i>Me is Derek. These are my wind chimes. </i>
<i>Oh, oh, oh.</i>

346
00:16:24,024 --> 00:16:25,442
<i>My wind chimes like you.</i>

[operative] <i>The only people here</i>

350
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:34,827
Where is Michael?

351
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:36,954
Oh, boy! Oh, boy!

352
00:16:37,037 --> 00:16:38,288
-[Lance] Hey, there, Mike.
-Oh!

353
00:16:38,372 --> 00:16:39,748
Hey, Lance. Looking good, buddy!

354
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:41,959
-Lose some weight?
-[Lance] I wish!

355
00:16:42,042 --> 00:16:44,628
We need to find Michael,
and we need to be discreet.

356
00:16:44,712 --> 00:16:46,672
You, search from
the Spastic Dentistry Department,

357
00:16:46,755 --> 00:16:48,007
down through Disembowelment.

358
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:52,136
You, cover Children's Dance Recitals
through Holiday Weekend IKEA. Go.

359
00:16:52,928 --> 00:16:57,099
Hey, hey, hey! Found him.
He was birddogging some tail.

360
00:16:57,182 --> 00:16:58,267
What you got for me, Trent?

361
00:17:00,102 --> 00:17:01,478
Well, peep this, dog.

362
00:17:02,146 --> 00:17:03,939
You really wanna torture this dirtbag?

363
00:17:05,065 --> 00:17:08,027
You give him books. I'm serious.

364
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:12,948
This one time I was assigned
this chick that I had to torture,

365
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:15,200
and I just couldn't figure it out.

366
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:18,078
And then I realized she hated books.

367
00:17:18,162 --> 00:17:21,373
So I just gave her mad books to read,
around the clock.

368
00:17:21,999 --> 00:17:23,584
The books, like, exploded?

369
00:17:23,667 --> 00:17:27,254
No, no, no. They were just
regular moral philosophy books.

370
00:17:27,337 --> 00:17:29,381
Everyone hates moral philosophers.

371
00:17:29,465 --> 00:17:30,466
That is true.

372
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:34,428
I know it's wild, but sometimes
you gotta think outside the bun.

373
00:17:34,511 --> 00:17:35,846
Sick Taco Bell ref.

374
00:17:35,929 --> 00:17:37,931
-Very nice!
-But I don't know, man.

375
00:17:38,015 --> 00:17:40,809
It sounds kind of lame.
This guy's the best? Really?

376
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:45,898
Yeah, maybe I don't know
what I'm talking... Ball tap!

377
00:17:45,981 --> 00:17:48,108
[all cheering]

378
00:17:48,192 --> 00:17:51,862
That's what you get for questioning Trent,
the torture master!

379
00:17:51,945 --> 00:17:54,448
-He got you so bad!
-Yeah, he did. He did.

380
00:17:54,531 --> 00:17:58,702
Nice job, bro. All right,
you've convinced me. I'll give him books.

381
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:03,123
Hey, you two.
Get your ugly necks over here.

382
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:07,503
Guys, I found something very bad.
We have to get out of here right now.

383
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:09,379
All right, everybody, gather around.

384
00:18:09,463 --> 00:18:10,881
This is the moment
we've all been waiting for.

385
00:18:10,964 --> 00:18:13,050
-What do we do?
-Just don't draw attention.

386
00:18:13,133 --> 00:18:15,302
It'll be over in a second.
We can sneak out the door.

387
00:18:15,385 --> 00:18:19,056
Feast your eyes on the newest exhibit here
at The Museum of Human Misery.

388
00:18:19,139 --> 00:18:23,685
The residents of Neighborhood 12358W.

389
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:28,232
Oh, no.

390
00:18:28,315 --> 00:18:30,067
Is that what they think
my hair looks like?

391
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:33,529
This game-changing experiment
chose four humans

392
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:35,531
and had them torture each other.

393
00:18:35,614 --> 00:18:39,827
It's already led to major breakthroughs
in the future of our industry.

394
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:42,746
Obviously, we couldn't get
the actual four idiots

395
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:47,000
as they're off being tortured,
so we cooked up the next best thing.

396
00:18:47,084 --> 00:18:48,252
-Wanna meet them?
-[audience] Yeah!

397
00:18:48,335 --> 00:18:51,880
I'm Tahani Al-Jamil,
a vainglorious attention-seeker,

398
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:55,884
with enough jealousy to power Elon Musk's
underwater mansion,

399
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:58,595
-which I've been to, by the way.
-[all laughing]

400
00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:01,223
I have, actually. It's remarkable.

401
00:19:01,306 --> 00:19:03,809
-It's remarkable.
-[all laughing]

402
00:19:03,892 --> 00:19:07,187
I'm Chidi Anagonye. Or maybe I'm not.

403
00:19:07,271 --> 00:19:10,774
-I can't decide anything. Or maybe I can.
-[all laughing]

404
00:19:10,858 --> 00:19:15,279
Ah. I can't decide. My stomach hurts.

405
00:19:15,362 --> 00:19:17,906
[audience laughing]

406
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:20,784
What? They kinda nailed it.
I've heard you say all that stuff.

407
00:19:20,868 --> 00:19:22,619
I'm Eleanor Shellstrop.

408
00:19:22,703 --> 00:19:26,915
I mock others to distract myself
from the emptiness inside me.

409
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:28,500
That's a fair hit.

410
00:19:28,584 --> 00:19:32,337
I'm Jason Mendoza. Duh!

411
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:34,631
-[audience laughing]
-That's me.

412
00:19:35,632 --> 00:19:39,678
Hey, where've you been?
Oh, how do you smell loud and confusing?

413
00:19:39,761 --> 00:19:42,514
No time to explain. We gotta go.
I got the travel pins.

414
00:19:42,598 --> 00:19:44,975
Yo, that looks like my boy Trent.

415
00:19:45,058 --> 00:19:46,810
And isn't that Rhonda Mumps?

416
00:19:46,894 --> 00:19:48,562
-Come on!
-There he is.

417
00:19:48,645 --> 00:19:51,023
-[Chidi] Uh-oh!
-And he's got the humans with him.

418
00:19:51,106 --> 00:19:52,482
All right, let's just back up here.

419
00:19:52,566 --> 00:19:53,775
What do we do?

420
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:55,444
This!

421
00:19:57,946 --> 00:20:02,034
Jortles! Go!

422
00:20:05,537 --> 00:20:07,497
Hey, Eleanor, thanks for the advice.
It was helpful.

423
00:20:07,581 --> 00:20:08,916
Even though I had to say
words I don't like,

424
00:20:08,999 --> 00:20:10,167
like "douche," "chick," and "peep this."

425
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:11,960
{\an8}No problem.
I'm focused on running right now.

426
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:13,086
{\an8}Right, I'm sorry!

427
00:20:17,799 --> 00:20:19,885
{\an8}Here. Put the pins on your lapels.

428
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:21,470
{\an8}Okay. Okay.

429
00:20:21,553 --> 00:20:23,180
{\an8}Uh, you didn't give me a pin, man.
I don’t have one.

430
00:20:23,263 --> 00:20:25,682
{\an8}-Okay, hang on.
-Hey, where's Janet?

431
00:20:25,766 --> 00:20:28,769
{\an8}No time to wait for her.
You three go. Now. Now!

432
00:20:30,395 --> 00:20:32,314
{\an8}[gasps and squeals]

433
00:20:33,649 --> 00:20:35,275
{\an8}[grunts]

434
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:36,568
{\an8}Portals!

435
00:20:38,195 --> 00:20:40,322
{\an8}-Any day now, man!
-[Shawn] Hey!

436
00:20:42,658 --> 00:20:43,700
Hey, guess what?

437
00:20:45,202 --> 00:20:47,537
I just solved the Trolley Problem.

438
00:20:48,455 --> 00:20:51,917
Remember? The thought experiment
where you're driving the trolley

439
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,461
and you can either
plow into a group of people

440
00:20:54,544 --> 00:20:57,965
or turn and hit one person? I solved it.

441
00:20:58,048 --> 00:20:59,925
That's really great.
But I don't think now's the time--

442
00:21:00,008 --> 00:21:01,343
The Trolley Problem forces you

443
00:21:01,426 --> 00:21:05,013
to choose between two versions
of letting other people die.

444
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:07,557
And the actual solution is very simple.

445
00:21:09,142 --> 00:21:11,812
-You sacrifice yourself.
-What does that mean?

446
00:21:14,064 --> 00:21:16,817
-You look after the others. They need you.
-No.

447
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:18,777
[Shawn] Step away from the portal!

448
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:21,280
-Goodbye, Eleanor.
-No, no, wait, wait!

449
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:28,453
Hey, boss. What's up?
