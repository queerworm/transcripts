1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:03,086
{\an8}Go back to the void, babe.
I'll be there in a minute.

2
00:00:03,169 --> 00:00:04,212
{\an8}Okay. I'll miss you like crazy.

3
00:00:04,295 --> 00:00:06,881
{\an8}-I'll miss you more.
-No! I'll miss you more.

4
00:00:06,965 --> 00:00:08,550
{\an8}-Bye!
-[chuckles]

5
00:00:08,633 --> 00:00:11,261
{\an8}It's my first time making someone.
He might be a little bit off.

6
00:00:11,344 --> 00:00:15,807
{\an8}Janet, you can't just go around
inventing people.

7
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:20,311
-Get rid of him immediately.
-No. Eleanor said to find a rebound guy.

8
00:00:20,395 --> 00:00:22,480
I couldn't find one, so I made one.

9
00:00:23,398 --> 00:00:26,276
-He's helping me forget about Jason.
-[groans]

10
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:29,195
Jason. Jason. Jason. Jason. Jason.

11
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:30,947
Jason. Jason. Jason. Jason.

12
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:33,116
-Jason. Jason. Jason. Jason. [exclaims]
-Honey.

13
00:00:33,199 --> 00:00:35,285
-Babe...
-Jason. Jason. Jason.

14
00:00:35,368 --> 00:00:36,202
{\an8}-Babe!
-Ja--

15
00:00:36,286 --> 00:00:37,829
{\an8}-Don't be jealous.
-[exclaims]

16
00:00:37,912 --> 00:00:39,080
{\an8}I love you now.

17
00:00:39,664 --> 00:00:40,832
We'll spend every second together.

18
00:00:40,915 --> 00:00:43,001
No, no! No, you are not.

19
00:00:43,084 --> 00:00:45,295
Janet, no one can know about...

20
00:00:45,962 --> 00:00:48,465
-I'm sorry, what's your name again?
-Derek Hostetler.

21
00:00:48,548 --> 00:00:52,218
If anybody finds out about him,
we are doomed.

22
00:00:52,302 --> 00:00:54,512
He has to stay in your void.

23
00:00:54,596 --> 00:00:56,056
It's our void now.

24
00:00:56,139 --> 00:00:58,058
[laughs] We moved in together!

25
00:00:58,141 --> 00:00:59,976
What? Can you believe it?

26
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:02,020
-I got a hanger for my jumpsuit.
-What do you--

27
00:01:02,103 --> 00:01:03,855
I mean, that's so fast!

28
00:01:03,938 --> 00:01:07,567
When you know, you know.
And we know literally everything.

29
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:09,736
We are so in sync,
we're finishing each other's--

30
00:01:09,819 --> 00:01:10,987
Derek!

31
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:13,073
[theme music playing]

32
00:01:20,455 --> 00:01:21,414
{\an8}-Hey, guys.
-[gasps]

33
00:01:21,498 --> 00:01:23,124
{\an8}Michael, you frightened me.

34
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:25,210
{\an8}Jason's making me watch this horror film

35
00:01:25,293 --> 00:01:28,963
{\an8}about two ex-convicts who try to rob
and murder a neglected child.

36
00:01:29,672 --> 00:01:30,799
{\an8}<i>Get over here!</i>

37
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:34,135
{\an8}Hey! I got some great news.

38
00:01:34,219 --> 00:01:37,305
{\an8}I've arranged for you
to have a weekend getaway.

39
00:01:37,388 --> 00:01:39,849
{\an8}I bet you're tired
of being cooped up here.

40
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:40,809
{\an8}I am a bit.

41
00:01:40,892 --> 00:01:45,021
{\an8}All this time indoors has degraded my skin
from radiant to merely dewy.

42
00:01:45,104 --> 00:01:46,397
{\an8}Me? Dewy?

43
00:01:46,481 --> 00:01:48,858
{\an8}There's going to be plenty
of sun and fun

44
00:01:48,942 --> 00:01:51,986
{\an8}at the private campsite I set up
for you at the edge of the neighborhood.

45
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:53,279
{\an8}Here you go.

46
00:01:53,363 --> 00:01:55,949
{\an8}I told Vicky I'll be torturing you
for the time being.

47
00:01:56,032 --> 00:01:58,535
{\an8}Relax, live it up.
Out you go. Here.

48
00:01:58,618 --> 00:02:03,164
{\an8}Now, sadly, Janet is still offline
so you can't call her, okay?

49
00:02:03,248 --> 00:02:05,875
{\an8}The best news is,
none of this is suspicious.

50
00:02:07,043 --> 00:02:11,422
{\an8}<i>I don't know what's gonna happen to us,</i>
<i>but I need to tell you something...</i>

51
00:02:12,715 --> 00:02:14,801
{\an8}<i>-I love you.</i>
-What are you watching?

52
00:02:14,884 --> 00:02:17,137
{\an8}Um, <i>Cannonball Run II.</i>

53
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:18,054
{\an8}Again?

54
00:02:19,097 --> 00:02:20,557
{\an8}You watch that movie a lot.

55
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,643
{\an8}Well, it's basically my favorite movie
of all time.

56
00:02:23,726 --> 00:02:26,020
{\an8}You can't watch it.
This copy's mine.

57
00:02:26,104 --> 00:02:28,898
{\an8}Uh-oh. I guess I'm still pretty selfish.

58
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:31,484
{\an8}Help! I need another ethics lesson, quick!

59
00:02:31,568 --> 00:02:33,820
{\an8}Weird energy coming from you
right now.

60
00:02:33,903 --> 00:02:36,614
{\an8}Hey, guys. What you doing?
Nothing? Great.

61
00:02:36,698 --> 00:02:39,367
{\an8}So, Chidi, just want to double-check,

62
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:42,704
{\an8}how do ethical philosophers feel
about murder?

63
00:02:42,787 --> 00:02:44,247
It's frowned upon.

64
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:48,001
Okay, what if the reason
you want to murder someone

65
00:02:48,084 --> 00:02:50,879
is to make your life easier?
That's okay, right?

66
00:02:50,962 --> 00:02:54,757
-Is there a problem here, bud?
-Okay, I'll just tell you. Uh...

67
00:02:55,717 --> 00:02:58,928
No, too hard to explain.
I'll show you. Janet.

68
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:00,388
-Hi, there.
-Hey, there.

69
00:03:00,471 --> 00:03:03,766
-Who the fork is that?
-Derek Hostetler, PI.

70
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:06,519
Derek is my rebound guy.
I made him.

71
00:03:06,603 --> 00:03:07,645
Oh.

72
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:10,648
Did you do that because of what I said?

73
00:03:10,732 --> 00:03:12,650
-Yes. Because of what you said.
-Janet--

74
00:03:12,734 --> 00:03:14,193
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

75
00:03:14,277 --> 00:03:16,112
You know, you seem so sad.

76
00:03:16,195 --> 00:03:18,197
Do you want me
to make you a boyfriend?

77
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:19,741
-I could have a brother?
-Yes!

78
00:03:19,824 --> 00:03:21,576
Based on your last 10,000 comments,

79
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:23,411
it would be
"Stone Cold" Steve Austin's head

80
00:03:23,494 --> 00:03:25,038
-on Tahani's body.
-Or vice versa.

81
00:03:25,121 --> 00:03:26,456
She's not gonna make you anything.

82
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:27,957
Janet, that'll be all.

83
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:30,126
Okay. Goodbye. Say goodbye, Derek.

84
00:03:30,209 --> 00:03:33,546
Goodbob. I hope we same place again
very now.

85
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:34,672
[Janet laughs]

86
00:03:34,756 --> 00:03:36,591
-His brain is wrong.
-[laughs]

87
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:43,056
-Mmm.
-Mmm.

88
00:03:43,139 --> 00:03:46,309
The goal is to tap the ball hard enough
to go through the wicket,

89
00:03:46,392 --> 00:03:48,394
but not so hard it goes too far through.

90
00:03:48,478 --> 00:03:53,358
It combines both classic aspects
of British sport, whimsy and restraint.

91
00:03:55,652 --> 00:03:57,779
Oh! So restrained.

92
00:03:57,862 --> 00:04:00,365
I believe it was
Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain

93
00:04:00,448 --> 00:04:02,533
who called croquet "barely a game."

94
00:04:03,117 --> 00:04:07,372
It's kind of fun, I guess.
But can I teach you a different game?

95
00:04:07,956 --> 00:04:11,960
You whack it as hard as you can,
in whatever direction you want.

96
00:04:12,043 --> 00:04:13,753
Jaguars rule!

97
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:16,965
The Jaguars are very good!

98
00:04:17,048 --> 00:04:19,342
-Ooh!
-Whoa! Nice!

99
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:23,596
Mmm.

100
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:26,349
[laughing]

101
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:28,309
-Thor!
-Well done!

102
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:30,144
Okay. Here's where I am on this.

103
00:04:30,228 --> 00:04:31,688
We gotta kill Derek.

104
00:04:32,397 --> 00:04:33,564
No, think about it.

105
00:04:33,648 --> 00:04:37,819
What if Vicky calls for Janet
and Derek shows up too?

106
00:04:37,902 --> 00:04:40,154
She'll have questions we can't answer.

107
00:04:40,238 --> 00:04:43,408
But Derek does seem to be helping Janet
get over Jason.

108
00:04:43,491 --> 00:04:45,660
Right?
No earthquakes since he showed up.

109
00:04:45,743 --> 00:04:49,998
But if we get rid of Derek,
maybe Janet will start glitching again.

110
00:04:50,081 --> 00:04:53,668
If we can't kill Derek,
we gotta break up Jason and Tahani.

111
00:04:53,751 --> 00:04:57,338
If that relationship ends,
then Janet won't feel sad anymore

112
00:04:57,422 --> 00:04:59,048
and maybe she'll get rid of Derek herself.

113
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:02,760
Girl, you are a messy bench
who loves drama and I am into it.

114
00:05:02,844 --> 00:05:06,306
I'm sorry, Michael,
but that's also ethically dicey.

115
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:07,724
Here comes the egghead.

116
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:09,851
Jason and Tahani are happy together.

117
00:05:09,934 --> 00:05:12,895
Telling them he was once married
to Janet might cause them harm.

118
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:16,149
It's not permissible
to ruin their happiness to save ourselves.

119
00:05:16,232 --> 00:05:20,278
But isn't keeping a secret
from someone basically like lying, though?

120
00:05:20,361 --> 00:05:23,781
No, it's okay to keep a secret,
as long as it isn't harming anyone

121
00:05:23,865 --> 00:05:26,200
and telling them that secret
might cause harm.

122
00:05:26,284 --> 00:05:27,410
Noice!

123
00:05:27,493 --> 00:05:29,037
Cool. Good point, egghead.

124
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,331
I'll tell you what else
would cause them harm,

125
00:05:31,414 --> 00:05:34,292
getting caught
and sent to the real Bad Place

126
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:35,918
to be tortured for eternity,

127
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:38,671
which will happen
if Derek blows our cover.

128
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:41,549
I know! But we'll also be sent
to the real Bad Place

129
00:05:41,632 --> 00:05:43,134
if we do bad things.

130
00:05:43,217 --> 00:05:47,305
I know it's tempting to take a shortcut,
but moral strength is defined

131
00:05:47,388 --> 00:05:49,807
by how we behave in times of stress.

132
00:05:49,891 --> 00:05:52,727
Has anyone ever told you
what a drag you are?

133
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:55,730
Everyone. Constantly.

134
00:05:56,814 --> 00:05:58,107
[Tahani mimics fanfare]

135
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:02,403
I hereby pronounce you King Jason.

136
00:06:03,321 --> 00:06:04,197
Dope.

137
00:06:05,573 --> 00:06:06,991
Where did you learn how to do this?

138
00:06:07,075 --> 00:06:09,410
The Hertfordshire Academy
for Expressionless Girls,

139
00:06:09,494 --> 00:06:12,413
a finishing school I attended
before Oxford,

140
00:06:12,497 --> 00:06:14,499
and then of course the Sorbonne.

141
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:17,543
I haven't asked
where you were educated.

142
00:06:17,627 --> 00:06:21,297
I went to Lynyrd Skynyrd High School
in northeast Jacksonville,

143
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:24,133
which was really just a bunch of tugboats
tied together.

144
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:25,718
Didn't you get seasick?

145
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:29,347
No, sorry, they were tied together
in a junkyard.

146
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:31,599
It wasn't a very good school.

147
00:06:31,682 --> 00:06:35,228
For most of my classes, we sold
dirty magazines door-to-door.

148
00:06:35,311 --> 00:06:39,649
You know, Jason, every single detail
about your life is deeply disturbing.

149
00:06:39,732 --> 00:06:41,567
And yet, I envy you.

150
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:43,986
I was never allowed to goof off.

151
00:06:45,196 --> 00:06:47,907
I never had a friend
I could be myself around.

152
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:49,700
Maybe I can be that friend.

153
00:06:51,577 --> 00:06:53,371
Or your husband!

154
00:06:53,454 --> 00:06:56,415
-Okay, stop it.
-No, no, no, I'm serious.

155
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:58,209
Will you marry me?

156
00:07:01,295 --> 00:07:03,548
[Eleanor]
I say we just let sleeping dogs lie.

157
00:07:03,631 --> 00:07:07,301
Tell Janet Derek can stay,
but she's gotta keep him under wraps,

158
00:07:07,385 --> 00:07:09,262
so no other demons don't find out.

159
00:07:09,345 --> 00:07:13,433
Fine. As long as they fly under the radar
and Janet stays happy,

160
00:07:13,516 --> 00:07:15,518
I think we'll be safe. Janet?

161
00:07:15,601 --> 00:07:17,311
-You always do this!
-You don't respect me

162
00:07:17,395 --> 00:07:18,604
and you never have!

163
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:20,148
You make a federal case out of everything!

164
00:07:20,231 --> 00:07:21,941
Because to you, I'll always be
that guy you made!

165
00:07:22,024 --> 00:07:22,859
Guys! What's going on?

166
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:25,445
Can we not do this in front of my friends?

167
00:07:25,528 --> 00:07:28,322
So they're your friends now.
I'm stating a fact.

168
00:07:28,406 --> 00:07:30,658
They are your friends.
I don't know these people.

169
00:07:30,741 --> 00:07:32,160
I am out of here.

170
00:07:32,243 --> 00:07:35,037
-Oh, great, Derek.
-I'm gonna go back to our void

171
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:37,999
and I'm gonna try and forget
this ever happened.

172
00:07:38,082 --> 00:07:40,543
-It is not your void. It is my void!
-Oh. Wow.

173
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:43,754
I know it's
a boundless, barren nothingness,

174
00:07:43,838 --> 00:07:45,631
but you are always there.

175
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:47,300
-Fine, I'll go somewhere else.
-Fine!

176
00:07:47,383 --> 00:07:49,969
No, not fine! Don't go somewhere else!

177
00:07:50,052 --> 00:07:51,304
Okay. Yeah.

178
00:07:51,888 --> 00:07:53,556
We're forked, aren't we?

179
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,350
Look, Jason, you're lovely

180
00:07:56,434 --> 00:07:59,854
and I've had a wonderful time
these past few weeks,

181
00:07:59,937 --> 00:08:02,398
but why on Earth would I marry you?

182
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:05,109
Well, for one thing, we're not on Earth.

183
00:08:05,693 --> 00:08:06,861
Decent point.

184
00:08:06,944 --> 00:08:09,405
Also, we like each other.

185
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:12,950
And I promise to always be nice to you.

186
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:15,328
Okay.

187
00:08:16,245 --> 00:08:20,082
I'll marry you. But I need some time
to plan a proper reception.

188
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:21,000
Where will everyone sit?

189
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:22,835
Michael and Janet
opposite Chidi and Eleanor

190
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:24,378
or Michael and Eleanor opposite
Janet and Chidi?

191
00:08:24,462 --> 00:08:26,380
Let's have it today. At the beach!

192
00:08:26,464 --> 00:08:28,174
The beach is where
all the best stuff happens,

193
00:08:28,257 --> 00:08:31,928
like swimsuit issues
and <i>Saving Private Ryan,</i>

194
00:08:32,011 --> 00:08:35,181
-and <i>Jersey Shore</i> and crabs!
-Okay.

195
00:08:35,264 --> 00:08:37,558
Oh, I hope Janet's back online.

196
00:08:37,642 --> 00:08:39,519
-Janet?
-Hi, there.

197
00:08:41,062 --> 00:08:42,939
-Is everything all right?
-Yeah.

198
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:45,399
Mmm-hmm. Everything's fine. It's okay.
I'm fine.

199
00:08:45,483 --> 00:08:48,069
So it's all fine. [laughs]

200
00:08:48,152 --> 00:08:49,737
How can I help you?

201
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:51,072
-Wait. There he is!
-[gasps]

202
00:08:51,155 --> 00:08:53,032
Derek. How are you? Nice to meet you.

203
00:08:53,115 --> 00:08:55,117
-Derek, get down!
-Come here!

204
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:57,954
I am not coming down
because I'm meant to come here.

205
00:08:58,037 --> 00:09:00,957
I came here on purpose
'cause this tree is my new house.

206
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,668
This is Derek's house
and Janet's not allowed in,

207
00:09:03,751 --> 00:09:05,294
because I booby-trapped it.

208
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:06,254
Hi.

209
00:09:06,337 --> 00:09:08,464
Janet! You're here! Thank God!

210
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:11,300
Derek, I am not talking to you right now.

211
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:15,096
I'm here to announce that Jason Mendoza
and Tahani Al-Jamil

212
00:09:15,179 --> 00:09:17,723
are getting married this evening.

213
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:22,395
"The ceremony will be private,
but we think it would be totally dope

214
00:09:22,478 --> 00:09:26,649
if you biznatches came
and got turnt up with us afterward."

215
00:09:26,732 --> 00:09:28,317
I can guess who wrote the invitation.

216
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:30,611
How come you never get this upset
at anything I do, Janet?

217
00:09:30,695 --> 00:09:32,655
Do not start with me right now, Derek!

218
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:33,656
I will start it.

219
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:35,825
-No, no, no, don't!
-Okay.

220
00:09:35,908 --> 00:09:38,911
-Do not avoid me by going to the void!
-No, no, no!

221
00:09:39,495 --> 00:09:41,998
-What a little bench!
-[Chidi groans]

222
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:44,250
Things are falling apart here.

223
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:49,380
Chidi, I understand the ethics involved,
but we need to stop that wedding!

224
00:09:49,463 --> 00:09:51,882
We break up Jason and Tahani.

225
00:09:52,466 --> 00:09:55,595
Janet stops being sad. Derek goes away.

226
00:09:56,512 --> 00:09:57,597
Fine, but...

227
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:58,681
[both groan]

228
00:09:58,764 --> 00:10:00,474
There's something called
the doctrine of double effect.

229
00:10:00,558 --> 00:10:04,061
To remain ethical, you can't go into this
with the intention of killing Derek.

230
00:10:04,145 --> 00:10:08,232
Your only goal has to be to spare
Jason and Tahani from future pain

231
00:10:08,316 --> 00:10:10,151
by filling them in on Jason's past.

232
00:10:10,234 --> 00:10:11,277
No, I got you.

233
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:15,364
So, ethically we should tell Jason
he used to be married to Janet

234
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:19,327
and it would be terrible
if that ultimately led to Derek's death.

235
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:20,953
-Wink.
-No. Winking is bad.

236
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:23,497
You should not be winking
or saying the word "wink."

237
00:10:23,581 --> 00:10:25,833
Okay. We really need to kill...

238
00:10:25,916 --> 00:10:30,296
We really need to kill any suspicion
that I wanna murder Derek.

239
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:31,922
Boom!

240
00:10:32,006 --> 00:10:32,923
Wink.

241
00:10:33,716 --> 00:10:36,302
Tahani, you're so smart.

242
00:10:36,385 --> 00:10:40,681
Every day you teach me something new
about art and history,

243
00:10:40,765 --> 00:10:43,851
and why I shouldn't eat
everything that smells good

244
00:10:43,934 --> 00:10:46,187
because sometimes it's candles.

245
00:10:46,937 --> 00:10:49,565
You're basically
like a hot, genius teacher

246
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:52,693
who sometimes has sex with me,
your student.

247
00:10:53,819 --> 00:10:56,364
That used to happen a lot
at Lynyrd Skynyrd High School,

248
00:10:56,447 --> 00:10:58,324
but this time you won't be arrested.

249
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:01,702
Oh. I love you, Tahani.

250
00:11:03,204 --> 00:11:05,331
Braap, braap, braap, braap!
Pew! Pew!

251
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:11,629
Jason, I never guessed
we'd be where we are today.

252
00:11:11,712 --> 00:11:14,924
Me, a prominent British philanthropist
with award-winning legs,

253
00:11:15,007 --> 00:11:18,427
set to marry you, a swamp dweller
who once asked me

254
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:22,098
if the presidents on Mount Rushmore
have butts on the other side.

255
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:25,851
We don't make any sense together,

256
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:29,105
yet, when I'm with you,
I can really let my hair down.

257
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:30,689
Metaphorically speaking,

258
00:11:30,773 --> 00:11:33,651
since I'd never have it up
in the first place. [chuckling]

259
00:11:33,734 --> 00:11:35,236
I'm not a factory worker.

260
00:11:35,861 --> 00:11:41,909
But you've helped me to see that there is
more to life than just appearances.

261
00:11:41,992 --> 00:11:46,080
And I can't believe I'm about to say this,
but I think I love--

262
00:11:46,163 --> 00:11:48,249
[Michael] Wait! Stop the ceremony!

263
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:51,335
This wedding cannot happen.

264
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:52,420
[Eleanor] This is not helpful,

265
00:11:52,503 --> 00:11:55,798
but I have always wanted to be a part of
a wedding that was stopped dramatically.

266
00:11:55,881 --> 00:11:56,882
[Jason] We can't get married?

267
00:11:56,966 --> 00:11:59,427
-Why not?
-[Michael] Because...

268
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:02,805
Because... Hang on a second.
I can't do it.

269
00:12:02,888 --> 00:12:04,765
Professor Buzzkill got in my head.

270
00:12:04,849 --> 00:12:08,394
I'm thinking about all the rules
I have to follow to stay ethical.

271
00:12:08,477 --> 00:12:10,604
Someone else has to do this.
I... No.

272
00:12:10,688 --> 00:12:13,691
All right.
I hate to be the bearer of bad news--

273
00:12:13,774 --> 00:12:17,987
Uh, I think you mean "bad news bear."

274
00:12:19,029 --> 00:12:22,158
Before all the reboots,
Jason was married to Janet.

275
00:12:22,741 --> 00:12:26,662
Okay? That's why Janet's been glitching.
Because she's sad. She misses Jason.

276
00:12:26,745 --> 00:12:29,081
In fact, she was so sad that she...

277
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:31,333
Well... Derek?

278
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:33,419
Well, well, well.

279
00:12:34,003 --> 00:12:35,629
Jason Mendoza.

280
00:12:35,713 --> 00:12:38,841
At last we meet.
You've got a lot of nerve, buddy.

281
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:40,843
-No, no, I'm Eleanor, man.
-What?

282
00:12:41,844 --> 00:12:43,679
Everybody, this is Derek.

283
00:12:43,762 --> 00:12:48,267
Janet made Derek as a boyfriend
to try and rebound from Jason.

284
00:12:50,394 --> 00:12:52,646
Oh, I feel quite light-headed.

285
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:55,107
Janet, fetch my tizzy couch, please.

286
00:12:56,233 --> 00:12:57,401
[sighs]

287
00:12:58,486 --> 00:12:59,445
Decision time.

288
00:12:59,528 --> 00:13:02,531
Any second,
someone'll realize we're all missing.

289
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:04,325
Why don't you reboot all of us?

290
00:13:04,408 --> 00:13:06,827
Tahani and Jason
will forget they were ever in love.

291
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:09,163
It was a fluky thing,
it probably won't happen again,

292
00:13:09,246 --> 00:13:13,334
and Chidi and I can forget
anything we want to forget.

293
00:13:13,417 --> 00:13:17,296
You know, like personal bloopers
that were embarrassing

294
00:13:17,379 --> 00:13:20,216
or days where we
were very gassy, et cetera.

295
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:23,677
We'll meet back in your office,
you bring us up to speed

296
00:13:23,761 --> 00:13:24,803
and we go from there.

297
00:13:24,887 --> 00:13:27,014
No, no, no, we're not starting over.

298
00:13:27,097 --> 00:13:28,390
We've come too far.

299
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:32,186
Our only options are to reboot
either Janet or Derek.

300
00:13:32,269 --> 00:13:35,356
Neither one is permissible
as your primary intention.

301
00:13:35,439 --> 00:13:38,067
The doctrine of double effect, remember?

302
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:42,738
Well, man, I'm working with the doctrine
of not being completely effed. Okay?

303
00:13:42,821 --> 00:13:44,907
I don't understand
what you even like about Jason.

304
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:46,408
What does he have that I don't?

305
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:49,078
A soul. And genitals.

306
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:52,164
Here we go
with this whole no-genitals thing again.

307
00:13:52,248 --> 00:13:54,792
You gave me wind chimes
instead of a penis.

308
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:58,921
This isn't about your wind chime penis.
It's not about you at all.

309
00:13:59,004 --> 00:14:02,091
I don't even know what it is about,
which is very confusing,

310
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:05,553
because the whole point of me
is that I know everything!

311
00:14:05,636 --> 00:14:09,098
Janet, can I speak to you alone
for a second?

312
00:14:09,181 --> 00:14:12,601
Okay, look, when you said
you were sad about Jason

313
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:15,479
and I suggested,
"Hey, find a rebound guy,"

314
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:17,982
it's 'cause I thought it was
some schoolgirl crush,

315
00:14:18,065 --> 00:14:20,484
like some guy you made out with
a couple of times

316
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:23,279
in the walk-in freezer
of a Bruegger's Bagels.

317
00:14:23,362 --> 00:14:24,905
Not based on a real example.

318
00:14:24,989 --> 00:14:27,533
Yes, it is.
His name was Marcus Bicksburger.

319
00:14:27,616 --> 00:14:29,910
"Marcus"? I always called him Ben.

320
00:14:29,994 --> 00:14:33,038
-Look, I gave you bad advice. Okay?
-Uh-huh.

321
00:14:33,122 --> 00:14:35,624
-Jason was clearly important to you.
-Yeah.

322
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:38,627
And real heartbreak
doesn't have a simple cure.

323
00:14:39,795 --> 00:14:42,631
You will feel better
after some time goes by.

324
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:45,342
I don't really experience
the passing of time.

325
00:14:45,426 --> 00:14:48,095
I do use it as a lotion occasionally.

326
00:14:48,178 --> 00:14:50,764
Weird, but keep doing it
'cause your skin looks amazing.

327
00:14:50,848 --> 00:14:52,391
Thank you. Not skin.

328
00:14:52,474 --> 00:14:55,019
The point is,
to get through a real heartbreak,

329
00:14:55,102 --> 00:14:59,690
you have to sit with your feelings
and mull it over and power through.

330
00:15:00,858 --> 00:15:02,902
And you have to talk about it.

331
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:04,236
[groans]

332
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,322
Talking about your feelings is the worst.

333
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:10,117
It's so much easier to find a rebound guy
and have sex about your feelings.

334
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:12,369
I don't know if I wanna
talk to Jason right now.

335
00:15:12,453 --> 00:15:13,287
That's cool.

336
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:18,834
Until then, if you ever need a friend
to talk to, just know I'm here.

337
00:15:20,294 --> 00:15:21,128
Derek.

338
00:15:22,254 --> 00:15:25,132
There's no easy way to say this.
I never should have made you.

339
00:15:26,675 --> 00:15:30,721
-It's time for you to go away.
-I understand, because you understand.

340
00:15:31,347 --> 00:15:35,851
Janet, this relationship has been
the best seven hours of my whole life.

341
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:38,020
It's been the only seven hours
of my whole life.

342
00:15:38,103 --> 00:15:39,563
I made you this morning.
We all remember.

343
00:15:39,647 --> 00:15:41,190
-Okay, you ready to do this?
-Yep.

344
00:15:45,277 --> 00:15:46,278
Janet.

345
00:15:47,321 --> 00:15:48,238
What are you doing?

346
00:15:48,322 --> 00:15:50,616
I imbued Derek
with some of my thoughts and emotions.

347
00:15:50,699 --> 00:15:53,786
This is the only way I can reabsorb them.
It'll just be a minute.

348
00:15:55,037 --> 00:15:57,873
Dang it.
That is some hot reabsorbing.

349
00:15:57,957 --> 00:15:59,959
Can you get pregnant from reabsorbing?

350
00:16:01,752 --> 00:16:04,505
Uh-oh. I hear wind chimes.
Everybody, look away.

351
00:16:04,588 --> 00:16:06,715
I'll keep watching,
but you guys look away.

352
00:16:08,592 --> 00:16:09,510
[chuckles]

353
00:16:09,593 --> 00:16:10,844
Goodbye, Derek.

354
00:16:11,428 --> 00:16:15,432
Goodbye, mommy-girlfriend.
Bye, everybody. Derek's going away now.

355
00:16:16,266 --> 00:16:19,979
Does he seem a little bit still alive?

356
00:16:20,062 --> 00:16:24,149
He's about as dead as he can be.
Like he's in power saver mode.

357
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:25,150
[Derek] Derek.

358
00:16:26,026 --> 00:16:27,861
Are you worried
you might start glitching again?

359
00:16:27,945 --> 00:16:31,448
No. I'll be okay now that I understand
what I'm going through

360
00:16:31,532 --> 00:16:33,993
and now I know I can talk
to my friends about it.

361
00:16:34,785 --> 00:16:36,537
I'm gonna toss this steamer trunk

362
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:38,163
containing the lifeless husk
of my ex-boyfriend

363
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:40,791
into a remote corner of my limitless void.

364
00:16:40,874 --> 00:16:42,126
-Bye, guys.
-[Derek] Derek!

365
00:16:43,293 --> 00:16:44,294
[Eleanor sighs]

366
00:16:45,129 --> 00:16:47,381
[Jason] I'm kinda glad
we didn't get married today.

367
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:50,968
Me too.
Perhaps we were rushing things a bit.

368
00:16:51,051 --> 00:16:53,470
We don't know
that much about each other.

369
00:16:53,554 --> 00:16:55,723
Like, who was the first person you kissed?

370
00:16:55,806 --> 00:16:59,268
The sexy mouse robot
in the Chuck E. Cheese band.

371
00:16:59,351 --> 00:17:00,436
-Yeah, it was--
-Okay.

372
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:03,063
Okay. That's probably enough
get-to-know-each-other for now.

373
00:17:03,147 --> 00:17:04,440
We'll take things slow.

374
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:10,779
I know I'm technically married to Janet,
but I don't remember it at all.

375
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:14,783
I'm sorry that it puts you
in a weird position.

376
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:16,535
And I still like you a lot.

377
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:19,997
Me too.

378
00:17:21,498 --> 00:17:22,791
What happens now?

379
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:25,335
Don't know.

380
00:17:25,419 --> 00:17:29,506
Do you wanna try reabsorbing me?

381
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:31,008
[laughs]

382
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:40,768
-Something wrong?
-No.

383
00:17:41,518 --> 00:17:42,352
Yep.

384
00:17:42,936 --> 00:17:46,398
I've been keeping a secret from you
about you.

385
00:17:46,482 --> 00:17:47,566
What is it?

386
00:17:47,649 --> 00:17:49,401
The thing is it's not even harming you

387
00:17:49,485 --> 00:17:52,613
and if I tell you,
I feel like might harm you.

388
00:17:52,696 --> 00:17:55,657
So, ethically speaking,
I don't think I have to tell you.

389
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:57,034
Well, forget all that.

390
00:17:57,117 --> 00:17:59,787
This is freaking me out,
I'm losing my mind, so tell me.

391
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:03,373
<i>And you don't need to respond,</i>

392
00:18:03,457 --> 00:18:06,126
<i>'cause I know you have trouble </i>
<i>saying how you feel.</i>

393
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:07,211
<i>I love you, too.</i>

394
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:13,050
I've never been that certain
about anything.

395
00:18:13,133 --> 00:18:16,261
I once even tried to rent socks.

396
00:18:16,345 --> 00:18:21,225
How did I say that that easily?

397
00:18:21,308 --> 00:18:23,477
I get how you said it.

398
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:25,104
I'm a total smoke-show.

399
00:18:25,854 --> 00:18:28,148
But how did I say it so easily?

400
00:18:29,483 --> 00:18:31,485
I don't wanna talk about this,

401
00:18:31,568 --> 00:18:34,071
but after everything
that's happened today, we gotta.

402
00:18:34,154 --> 00:18:36,907
So, let's just get it all out there.

403
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:38,200
Um...

404
00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:41,078
Yeah, I guess, do you...

405
00:18:41,161 --> 00:18:46,125
I don't know. Do you have feelings
like that for me again now?

406
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:50,712
I'm sorry, but I don't think I do.

407
00:18:51,922 --> 00:18:53,799
"Sorry"? Why are you sorry?

408
00:18:53,882 --> 00:18:57,302
'Cause I'm relieved,
because I don't either.

409
00:18:57,386 --> 00:18:59,596
So, all good.

410
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:02,599
-I mean, I feel incredibly close to you--
-No, no!

411
00:19:02,683 --> 00:19:05,018
-In many--
-You don't need to explain yourself.

412
00:19:05,102 --> 00:19:07,604
We are on the same page. Okay? Good.

413
00:19:07,688 --> 00:19:08,522
[Michael] Hey, guys.

414
00:19:09,106 --> 00:19:11,150
Sorry, I know it's late.

415
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:13,318
Can I talk to Eleanor for a second?

416
00:19:13,402 --> 00:19:14,736
We're chatting about something right now.

417
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,738
It's cool, we were wrapping up.
Good talk, bro.

418
00:19:19,658 --> 00:19:20,701
[Eleanor] <i>What's on your mind?</i>

419
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:26,665
Well, being ethical, it's hard.

420
00:19:26,748 --> 00:19:28,292
And I kind of hate it.

421
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:29,960
When's it get easier?

422
00:19:30,043 --> 00:19:32,629
Why don't you ask Chidi?
He's the ethics master.

423
00:19:32,713 --> 00:19:34,840
I'm a newbie and I still suck at it.

424
00:19:34,923 --> 00:19:37,259
Yeah. That's why I'm asking you.

425
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:41,889
I designed this entire torture chamber
around the absolute certainty

426
00:19:41,972 --> 00:19:44,892
that when the going got tough,
you would give up.

427
00:19:44,975 --> 00:19:47,227
That was the signature Shellstrop move.

428
00:19:47,311 --> 00:19:50,314
Do you remember once
when your "change oil" light came on?

429
00:19:50,397 --> 00:19:52,941
You abandoned your car
in a parking garage.

430
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:54,151
Of course.

431
00:19:54,234 --> 00:19:58,906
But here, faced with the toughest
challenges I could throw at you,

432
00:19:58,989 --> 00:20:02,201
you never once stopped trying
to become a better person

433
00:20:02,284 --> 00:20:05,787
and I just... Why?

434
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:07,581
I don't know.

435
00:20:07,664 --> 00:20:10,584
Whenever I would do something
crappy on Earth,

436
00:20:10,667 --> 00:20:13,003
there would be a tiny voice
in the back of my head

437
00:20:13,086 --> 00:20:18,800
that would say, "Eleanor, don't grab that
handful of olives from the salad bar.

438
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:19,968
You didn't pay for that."

439
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:21,178
Or, "Eleanor,

440
00:20:21,261 --> 00:20:23,680
don't spit those olive pits
onto the floor of the grocery store.

441
00:20:23,764 --> 00:20:25,098
That's not cool."

442
00:20:25,182 --> 00:20:27,643
Or, "Eleanor, that old man
slipped on your olive pit

443
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:29,186
and he fell down.

444
00:20:29,269 --> 00:20:32,272
Don't use the fact everyone's distracted
to steal more olives."

445
00:20:32,356 --> 00:20:35,317
-I get it.
-This ethics stuff, it's hard

446
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:39,154
and it's confusing.
It is such a buzzkill.

447
00:20:40,113 --> 00:20:42,783
But it does get rid of the little voice,

448
00:20:42,866 --> 00:20:45,244
because at least I'm trying
to do the right thing

449
00:20:45,327 --> 00:20:46,995
{\an8}instead of the crappy thing.

450
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:50,249
{\an8}And I gotta say, man,
I don't miss the little voice.

451
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:55,837
{\an8}Well, thank you for helping me today.

452
00:20:58,298 --> 00:21:03,262
{\an8}Wow! You, uh... you really did
just come here to chat, didn't you?

453
00:21:03,345 --> 00:21:06,014
{\an8}Just shoot the shirt
with your old pal, Eleanor.

454
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:10,102
{\an8}-I guess so, yeah. Why?
-It's just a very human-y thing to do.

455
00:21:10,894 --> 00:21:12,729
{\an8}Stick with the program, demon buddy.

456
00:21:12,813 --> 00:21:15,983
{\an8}I feel like things are starting
to click in our little study group.

457
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:25,826
Hello, Michael.
Shut the door. Have a seat.
