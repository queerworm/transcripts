1
00:00:02,127 --> 00:00:05,088
{\an8}So my mom is alive and she lives here.

2
00:00:05,672 --> 00:00:07,298
Why didn't you tell me sooner, man?

3
00:00:07,382 --> 00:00:12,512
I'd already told you that you'd died,
and that I had tortured you for centuries,

4
00:00:12,595 --> 00:00:14,889
and that you're doomed
to be tortured again.

5
00:00:14,973 --> 00:00:17,100
I just didn't want to be a bummer.

6
00:00:18,101 --> 00:00:21,896
But now you know everything important
about your life. I promise.

7
00:00:22,522 --> 00:00:26,025
A police officer came to my home
and told me

8
00:00:26,109 --> 00:00:28,570
that my mom had been
accidentally trampled to death

9
00:00:28,653 --> 00:00:31,865
when she bent down to adjust her toe ring
at a Rascal Flatts concert.

10
00:00:31,948 --> 00:00:34,117
That police officer was an actor.

11
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:37,454
See, about a month before,
your mom had gotten drunk,

12
00:00:37,537 --> 00:00:41,583
wandered into a charity auction
and bid $30,000

13
00:00:41,666 --> 00:00:43,001
for a date with Gene Simmons,

14
00:00:43,668 --> 00:00:47,422
outbidding everyone else by $29,800.

15
00:00:47,505 --> 00:00:49,007
She didn't wanna pay.

16
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:54,304
So, she faked her death, moved to Nevada
and reinvented herself as Diana Tremaine.

17
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:57,474
Diana Tremaine is my fake ID name!
[gasps]

18
00:00:58,141 --> 00:01:00,643
How dare she steal the identity I stole.

19
00:01:00,727 --> 00:01:02,645
[Michael] Look, I know
this is a lot to take in,

20
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:06,024
but we're here to help your mom
get into the Good Place.

21
00:01:06,107 --> 00:01:09,652
Whatever you're feeling, remember,
this is not about you.

22
00:01:10,236 --> 00:01:11,196
-Right.
-[knock on door]

23
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:14,074
How could you do this to me?

24
00:01:14,157 --> 00:01:16,159
[theme music playing]

25
00:01:21,206 --> 00:01:23,291
Yay! You found me!

26
00:01:23,374 --> 00:01:24,793
What the hell, Mom?

27
00:01:24,876 --> 00:01:29,339
{\an8}Okay, baby, I can explain everything.
Let's all just take a breath.

28
00:01:29,422 --> 00:01:34,677
{\an8}You haven't even introduced me
to this stretched out, sexy Alex Trebek.

29
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:36,429
{\an8}I'm Michael.
It's nice to meet you, Donna.

30
00:01:36,513 --> 00:01:41,226
{\an8}Oh, it's Diana now, for police reasons.

31
00:01:41,309 --> 00:01:43,686
{\an8}By the way, whose McMansion is this?

32
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:48,817
{\an8}My boyfriend, Dave's. He's kind of a dork,
but real sweet and so fancy.

33
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:52,862
{\an8}His napkins are made out
of shirt material.

34
00:01:52,946 --> 00:01:54,114
{\an8}Cloth.

35
00:01:54,614 --> 00:01:57,992
{\an8}Okay, now this is making sense.

36
00:01:58,076 --> 00:02:02,330
{\an8}You change your name, bag a rich loser
with a tacky house. I get it.

37
00:02:02,914 --> 00:02:04,374
{\an8}-You're running a scam.
-[Donna] No.

38
00:02:04,457 --> 00:02:08,044
{\an8}Baby, this is as real
as the nails under my acrylic nails.

39
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:09,838
{\an8}I'm a different person.

40
00:02:09,921 --> 00:02:13,383
{\an8}Spare me. You will always be
sun-baked Arizona trash.

41
00:02:13,466 --> 00:02:17,137
{\an8}And I know that because I grew up
baking right beside you.

42
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:18,930
{\an8}Geez, I didn't know we had company.

43
00:02:19,013 --> 00:02:20,765
{\an8}-Hey. Hi, I'm Dave.
-Michael.

44
00:02:20,849 --> 00:02:21,683
{\an8}Of course you're Dave.

45
00:02:21,766 --> 00:02:25,353
{\an8}Hey, Dave? You and I need to have
a little conversation.

46
00:02:25,436 --> 00:02:27,147
-Diana.
-[Donna] Oh, hey.

47
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:28,648
Who the hell is this chick?

48
00:02:28,731 --> 00:02:32,694
This is my little potato pie, Patricia.
And who might you be, by the way?

49
00:02:33,194 --> 00:02:36,447
-Eleanor is my sorority sister.
-[Eleanor] Right.

50
00:02:36,531 --> 00:02:39,450
Good old Kappa Zeta... Jones.

51
00:02:39,534 --> 00:02:41,119
-Oh!
-[Donna] Hey.

52
00:02:41,911 --> 00:02:44,539
{\an8}[Tahani] I can't believe I have to
wait in line to see my own sister.

53
00:02:44,622 --> 00:02:48,877
I have never waited in any kind
of formation, let alone a line.

54
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,671
[Chidi] Wow!
Is this whole room just her work?

55
00:02:51,754 --> 00:02:54,257
Don't be fooled, Chidi.
Kamilah is a charlatan.

56
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:57,594
All she has to do is paint
some dumb shapes and people go mad.

57
00:02:57,677 --> 00:03:00,263
Those aren't dumb shapes.
They're a pair of boobs.

58
00:03:00,346 --> 00:03:01,890
And then two extra sideboobs.

59
00:03:01,973 --> 00:03:05,310
It symbolizes that boobs come
in all shapes and sizes

60
00:03:05,393 --> 00:03:06,644
and distances apart.

61
00:03:06,728 --> 00:03:08,438
Ugh! Maybe we should just go.

62
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:10,815
There are plenty of other people
I could help.

63
00:03:10,899 --> 00:03:11,774
Like my good friend Ben Affleck

64
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:13,318
and his crippling addiction
to back tattoos.

65
00:03:13,401 --> 00:03:14,903
Or my other good friend Matt Damon

66
00:03:14,986 --> 00:03:17,030
and his crippling addiction
to my friend Ben Affleck.

67
00:03:17,113 --> 00:03:18,740
It's important that you make amends.

68
00:03:18,823 --> 00:03:20,491
Your competitive relationship with Kamilah

69
00:03:20,575 --> 00:03:23,161
is largely the reason
that you didn't get into the Good Place.

70
00:03:23,244 --> 00:03:25,580
Stands to reason
that the same would be true for her.

71
00:03:25,663 --> 00:03:28,207
Fine. But the waiting is over.

72
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:30,835
Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me.

73
00:03:31,961 --> 00:03:34,923
Tahani.
Were you waiting in line to see me?

74
00:03:35,006 --> 00:03:36,424
That's hilarious.

75
00:03:37,508 --> 00:03:39,719
As a frog stares up in awe
at the treetops,

76
00:03:39,802 --> 00:03:43,139
so too does humanity gawk
at the purity of a blinding truth.

77
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:45,183
Napkins and forks are in the back.

78
00:03:45,767 --> 00:03:48,228
So, making omelets is art now, is it?

79
00:03:48,311 --> 00:03:50,104
Not that I'd expect you to understand,

80
00:03:50,188 --> 00:03:52,273
but it's a commentary
on the world's fascination

81
00:03:52,357 --> 00:03:55,610
with subservience, consumption,
death and pedagogy.

82
00:03:56,444 --> 00:03:57,278
Cheddar or Swiss?

83
00:03:57,362 --> 00:03:59,781
No, I don't want an omelet.
I just came for a quick sisterly chat.

84
00:03:59,864 --> 00:04:01,074
[bell ringing]

85
00:04:01,157 --> 00:04:04,410
My sister, Tahani,
refuses to order an omelet.

86
00:04:04,494 --> 00:04:05,536
[crowd gasps]

87
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:08,456
As a result, the exhibit is now over
and will never be shown again.

88
00:04:08,539 --> 00:04:09,624
There will be no refunds.

89
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:11,793
{\an8}[speaking Hungarian]

90
00:04:21,219 --> 00:04:25,598
Hey, now. I just checked my Apple Watch
and it's marg-o'-clock.

91
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:27,058
[Dave and Donna laughing]

92
00:04:27,141 --> 00:04:28,935
So, Michael, what do you do?

93
00:04:29,018 --> 00:04:31,521
Ah, well, I'm an architect.

94
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:33,690
-Get out of here. Me, too.
-Huh!

95
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:37,360
Dave's real good.
You should see the new Hooters on I-15.

96
00:04:37,443 --> 00:04:40,071
It looks classy. Like a bank.

97
00:04:40,154 --> 00:04:42,240
So, how did you two loverats meet?

98
00:04:42,323 --> 00:04:45,243
It's a fun story.
I was working on this project

99
00:04:45,326 --> 00:04:48,371
tearing down a condemned bar
called the Desert Rash.

100
00:04:48,454 --> 00:04:49,998
I went in to meet with the contractors

101
00:04:50,081 --> 00:04:53,251
and Diana is sitting at the bar,
drinking a seven in Seven in seven.

102
00:04:53,334 --> 00:04:55,670
Seven shots of Seagram's 7
in seven minutes.

103
00:04:55,753 --> 00:04:57,463
It's Diana's morning drink.

104
00:04:57,547 --> 00:04:59,507
That's right.
It was very early in the morning.

105
00:05:00,091 --> 00:05:03,886
Well, this little spitfire finds out
it's me who's closing down the bar.

106
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:06,389
Next thing I know,
she's got a knife to my face.

107
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:07,432
[chuckling]

108
00:05:07,515 --> 00:05:08,891
I would have been scared
if she hadn't been

109
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:10,727
the most gorgeous thing
I've ever seen in my life.

110
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:13,646
Aww. One thing leads to another,
and all of a sudden,

111
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:17,025
we're playing tonsil tennis
on a broken toilet in the alley out back.

112
00:05:17,108 --> 00:05:18,359
Cute.

113
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:20,361
So how did you and Eleanor become friends?

114
00:05:20,445 --> 00:05:25,575
Let's just say
that we lived in the same neighborhood.

115
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:26,951
Ooh. [laughs]

116
00:05:27,035 --> 00:05:29,329
What a fun way
to say a normal thing, right?

117
00:05:29,412 --> 00:05:32,540
Well, I've gotta go get ready.
Today is PTA elections

118
00:05:32,623 --> 00:05:33,791
and I'm running for secretary.

119
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:37,420
[Dave] And she's a shoo-in, too.
Hey, Patty, we gotta get ready, okay?

120
00:05:38,713 --> 00:05:41,591
I know we came here
to set your mom on a better path,

121
00:05:41,674 --> 00:05:43,676
but I think she's doing pretty great.

122
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,928
Please. She's completely full of it.

123
00:05:46,429 --> 00:05:49,474
I am gonna find out what kind of scam
Donna Shellstrop is running

124
00:05:49,557 --> 00:05:52,226
and I am gonna take her down.

125
00:05:52,977 --> 00:05:54,854
Right after I finish this awesome drink.

126
00:05:55,438 --> 00:05:56,898
Man, Dave's margaritas are amazing.

127
00:05:56,981 --> 00:05:58,107
-Right?
-[Eleanor] Yeah.

128
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:00,318
And I'm not even a tequila guy.

129
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:05,239
[Jason] So, this is what
a museum looks like.

130
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:11,788
If you look at this painting closely,
you can really notice the interpretation.

131
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:15,124
I know you're just being silly
and effortlessly charming,

132
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:16,542
but you actually just picked

133
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:18,920
the most valuable painting
in the entire museum.

134
00:06:19,003 --> 00:06:23,591
As of last year,
that work was valued at $39.2 million.

135
00:06:23,674 --> 00:06:25,718
Oh, snap! I forgot you know everything.

136
00:06:26,302 --> 00:06:27,512
How much is that one worth?

137
00:06:27,595 --> 00:06:30,264
That one is worth $13.7 million.

138
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:33,684
That one's got a bunch of colors.
That's gotta add some value.

139
00:06:33,768 --> 00:06:35,770
Can we do this for all the paintings?

140
00:06:36,646 --> 00:06:40,691
Look, I've had a sort of revelation
about the world.

141
00:06:40,775 --> 00:06:45,363
And I would like to take responsibility
for my part in our fraught history.

142
00:06:45,446 --> 00:06:48,574
For whatever hurt I've caused you,

143
00:06:49,158 --> 00:06:51,452
I sincerely apologize.

144
00:06:52,662 --> 00:06:53,496
Thank you.

145
00:06:54,455 --> 00:06:57,083
I do not accept your apology.
Is that all, then?

146
00:06:58,668 --> 00:06:59,836
[scoffs]

147
00:07:00,711 --> 00:07:03,214
Well... [breathing heavily]

148
00:07:06,717 --> 00:07:07,760
[exclaims]

149

00:07:15,893 --> 00:07:17,687
Check out what Dave gave me.

153
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:21,816
Plans for
a Subaru dealership/burlesque club

154
00:07:21,899 --> 00:07:23,484
he's designing in Reno.

155
00:07:24,193 --> 00:07:26,863
Man, Nevada's a mess.
What are you doing?

156
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:30,324
Searching for the telltale sign
of a Donna Shellstrop scam.

157
00:07:31,033 --> 00:07:32,368
A pile of cash hidden somewhere,

158
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:34,787
so she can grab it
and head out on the run.

159
00:07:34,871 --> 00:07:37,498
When the time comes,
she will rip this guy off

160
00:07:37,582 --> 00:07:39,792
and disappear like Keyser Söze,

161
00:07:39,876 --> 00:07:42,211
right after he admitted
to groping all those people.

162
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:43,421
Why are you in my room?

163
00:07:43,504 --> 00:07:45,173
Hey, girl. What's up?

164
00:07:45,256 --> 00:07:47,675
-How old are you? Three?
-I'm nine.

165
00:07:47,758 --> 00:07:49,969
Cool. I don't know anything about kids.

166
00:07:50,052 --> 00:07:53,014
Hey, has Diana ever made you hide

167
00:07:53,097 --> 00:07:55,725
like a special treasure
in any of your toys?

168
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:57,185
[Patricia] No, Diana's very nice to me.

169
00:07:57,268 --> 00:07:58,936
She bought me
most of these stuffed animals.

170
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:01,522
[gasps] Oh, wow. Neat.

171
00:08:01,606 --> 00:08:04,025
Mind if I give him just a little surgery
just to check?

172
00:08:04,108 --> 00:08:05,860
Okay, okay, okay, all right.

173
00:08:05,943 --> 00:08:08,905
Doc McStuffins,
let's get you some fresh air.

174
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:10,114
So sorry.

175
00:08:10,198 --> 00:08:13,242
She's a kid.
You can't disembowel her toys.

176
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:14,452
Fine, new plan.

177
00:08:14,535 --> 00:08:17,955
You casually mention that you're rich
and seduce Donna.

178
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:21,792
When she goes for you, it will prove
that this whole thing is a sham.

179
00:08:21,876 --> 00:08:24,003
First things first. Do you have a penis?

180
00:08:24,086 --> 00:08:25,880
I will not seduce Donna.

181
00:08:25,963 --> 00:08:28,799
For one thing,
I could never do that to my pal Dave.

182
00:08:28,883 --> 00:08:30,551
It goes against the architects' code.

183
00:08:30,635 --> 00:08:33,721
Also, your mother seems happy here.

184
00:08:33,804 --> 00:08:37,808
The Donna I know wouldn't be caught dead
in this suburban boredom factory.

185
00:08:38,392 --> 00:08:39,435
She's scamming them.

186
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:42,146
Look, believe me, don't believe me.
I don't care. I'm gonna prove it.

187
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:47,485
Young lady, you will stop this nonsense,
go to the PTA meeting,

188
00:08:47,568 --> 00:08:50,863
and support your mother.
I won't hear another word about it.

189
00:08:52,698 --> 00:08:53,616
What the hell was that?

190
00:08:53,699 --> 00:08:57,411
Well, I was going
for the stern-but-caring-dad vibe.

191
00:08:57,495 --> 00:08:58,579
No? Didn't work?

192
00:08:58,663 --> 00:09:00,790
Not even close.
Like, not in the ballpark.

193
00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:04,043
I was trying something, Eleanor.
Give me a break.

194
00:09:04,794 --> 00:09:07,129
Until Kamilah accepts my apology,
this open wound

195
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:10,383
will hinder any progress she might make
toward getting into the Good Place.

196
00:09:10,466 --> 00:09:13,553
Also, I am going to strangle her,

197
00:09:13,636 --> 00:09:16,639
which will hinder any air
from getting into her lungs.

198
00:09:16,722 --> 00:09:17,640
Can I talk to her?

199
00:09:18,307 --> 00:09:20,810
Maybe we should try
a little third-party mediation.

200
00:09:24,105 --> 00:09:27,567
Uh, hi. I'm Tahani's friend, Chidi.

201
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:30,152
"Chidi" is an Igbo word
that means "God exists."

202
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:35,366
That's right. Sorry, I don't know
the etymology of your name, but...

203
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:39,495
-What is it?
-All of your fears are now mine.

204
00:09:43,499 --> 00:09:46,002
-What did she say?
-What? I don't know.

205
00:09:46,502 --> 00:09:48,421
Sorry, I got distracted.

206
00:09:48,504 --> 00:09:51,882
She's amazing.
All of my fears are hers now.

207
00:09:51,966 --> 00:09:53,092
Of course they are.

208
00:09:57,638 --> 00:10:00,975
I sincerely apologize to you,
because I have matured

209
00:10:01,058 --> 00:10:04,478
into a fully-formed adult
with empathy and self-awareness,

210
00:10:04,562 --> 00:10:06,897
but if you don't accept my apology,

211
00:10:06,981 --> 00:10:10,651
I will smash your stupid art exhibit
into bits.

212
00:10:10,735 --> 00:10:13,529
More Tahani theatrics
with zero follow-through?

213
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:16,240
You don't have it in you
to do anything that bold,

214
00:10:16,324 --> 00:10:18,576
because I'm the one
who got the boldness gene,

215
00:10:18,659 --> 00:10:20,661
and the good eyebrow gene.

216
00:10:20,745 --> 00:10:22,455
[gasps and shouts]

217
00:10:22,538 --> 00:10:24,498
Oh! Oh, no.

218
00:10:24,582 --> 00:10:26,167
All my fears are mine again.

219
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:30,212
Hey, Davey.
Can you believe the design of this room?

220
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:33,257
Auditorium? More like audi-bore-me-um.

221
00:10:33,341 --> 00:10:34,759
[both laughing]

222
00:10:34,842 --> 00:10:36,302
Savage.

223
00:10:36,385 --> 00:10:41,265
Hello. I'm Diana Tremaine.
I never thought I'd run for PTA board.

224
00:10:41,349 --> 00:10:44,101
For most of my life, I preferred to crawl.

225
00:10:45,102 --> 00:10:46,854
-Pub crawl!
-[crowd chuckles]

226
00:10:46,937 --> 00:10:48,773
But now, I wanna make sure

227
00:10:48,856 --> 00:10:53,861
kids in this decommissioned military
bombing test site turned suburban township

228
00:10:53,944 --> 00:10:56,906
get the best education
Nevada has to offer.

229
00:10:56,989 --> 00:10:59,700
[scoffs] What's that?
Always double down on 11?

230
00:10:59,784 --> 00:11:03,621
Also, there's a pretty great kid
who goes to this school,

231
00:11:03,704 --> 00:11:07,583
and I wanna make this place great for her.
Stand up, sweetheart.

232
00:11:13,547 --> 00:11:15,800
Well, it was the first Hooters
ever made out of brick.

233
00:11:15,883 --> 00:11:17,468
It's sort of inspired by Monticello.

234
00:11:17,551 --> 00:11:19,804
-Hey, Mark.
-No, it's Dave.

235
00:11:19,887 --> 00:11:22,181
I know your name.
I'm calling you a mark.

236
00:11:22,264 --> 00:11:23,265
Easy.

237
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:27,269
I got news for you, dad bod.
The woman you know as Diana Tremaine

238
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:31,482
is really Donna Shellstrop,
my much older mother.

239
00:11:31,565 --> 00:11:34,276
She faked her death and changed her name.

240
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,821
Sorry to burst your bubble,
but that's the deal.

241
00:11:37,905 --> 00:11:39,573
I already knew all that, Eleanor.

242
00:11:40,157 --> 00:11:42,535
Your mother told me everything
the first night we met.

243
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:45,371
-First night?
-Well, no. Not the first night, actually.

244
00:11:45,454 --> 00:11:46,705
That was mostly sex.

245
00:11:47,665 --> 00:11:50,626
Your mother is a very confident
and selfish lover.

246
00:11:50,709 --> 00:11:51,544
Yikes.

247
00:11:51,627 --> 00:11:53,421
No, it's perfect for me,
'cause I don't know what I want.

248
00:11:53,504 --> 00:11:55,881
But anyway, the next morning,
she told me everything.

249
00:11:55,965 --> 00:11:58,342
And we're gonna tell Patricia
once she's a little bit older.

250
00:11:58,426 --> 00:12:00,970
-For now, everything is going great.
-No.

251
00:12:01,053 --> 00:12:02,513
Dude, you don't know my mom.

252
00:12:02,596 --> 00:12:04,890
She used to put
50 things in a shopping cart,

253
00:12:04,974 --> 00:12:07,184
then go to the "12 items or less" aisle,

254
00:12:07,268 --> 00:12:10,062
scream "rat"
and run out the door without paying.

255
00:12:10,146 --> 00:12:11,397
She is a liar.

256
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:14,066
Well, listen, she has been
nothing but honest with me,

257
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:17,611
and I like that she's got a wild streak.
Kinda gets my motor running.

258
00:12:17,695 --> 00:12:22,032
To tell you the truth, she's turning me
into a bit of a bad boy.

259
00:12:22,116 --> 00:12:24,660
I mean, who am I? Avril Lavigne?

260
00:12:24,743 --> 00:12:26,120
[both chuckle]

261
00:12:29,498 --> 00:12:33,878
Oh, I get it.
Coming clean was all part of the scam.

262
00:12:33,961 --> 00:12:36,255
It's brilliant
because he thinks she's honest,

263
00:12:36,338 --> 00:12:39,383
so when she runs off with all his money,
he'll never see it coming.

264
00:12:39,467 --> 00:12:42,303
Come on, Eleanor.
I changed, you changed.

265
00:12:42,386 --> 00:12:45,514
-Maybe she changed, too.
-No. No way.

266
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:50,644
Why can't you accept that she might be
living a good, honest life?

267
00:12:50,728 --> 00:12:53,981
That she's an attentive partner
and a good mom?

268
00:12:54,064 --> 00:12:56,025
Because I wanted that mom.

269
00:12:56,692 --> 00:12:59,570
I wanted the mom
who made me afternoon snacks

270
00:12:59,653 --> 00:13:01,906
instead of just telling me
to look for loose fries

271
00:13:01,989 --> 00:13:03,407
in the McDonald's ball pit.

272
00:13:03,491 --> 00:13:05,159
Why does Patricia get that mom?

273
00:13:05,242 --> 00:13:08,037
If Donna Shellstrop has truly changed,

274
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,289
then that means
she was always capable of change,

275
00:13:10,372 --> 00:13:13,083
but I just wasn't worth changing for.

276
00:13:15,711 --> 00:13:19,256
I know as your self-appointed
father figure,

277
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:22,384
I'm supposed to say
something comforting here,

278
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:24,386
but I'm stumped.

279
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:26,889
[woman] Okay, final tally.

280
00:13:26,972 --> 00:13:29,058
Forty-three votes for Diana Tremaine...

281
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:31,685
-[crowd exclaims]
-...twelve votes for Ilene Capshaw

282
00:13:31,769 --> 00:13:35,105
and one vote for Bofa Deez Nuts.

283
00:13:36,273 --> 00:13:39,276
[scoffs] Don't look at me like that.
You're not my real dad.

284
00:13:45,115 --> 00:13:47,868
Congratulations, Madam Secretary.

285
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:50,037
It's so crazy, right?

286
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:53,415
I'm gonna need to get a calculator.
And maybe a globe?

287
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:56,001
I don't really understand the job.

288
00:13:56,085 --> 00:14:00,256
Listen, I'm sorry that I didn't think
this whole thing was real.

289
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:04,093
I just never thought I'd see the day
when you made a commitment to...

290
00:14:05,094 --> 00:14:05,928
anything.

291
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:07,137
I was wrong.

292
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:10,140
Thank you, baby. That means a lot.

293
00:14:11,934 --> 00:14:12,893
[Eleanor] Let me help you.

294
00:14:12,977 --> 00:14:15,563
No, no, no, not that one!
No, sorry, sorry.

295
00:14:15,646 --> 00:14:17,481
{\an8}This powder is only for my delicates.

296
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:20,776
-You don't wash your bras.
-No.

297
00:14:21,652 --> 00:14:23,487
-No.
-[gasps] I knew it!

298
00:14:24,071 --> 00:14:27,741
My mother is a con artist! Gotcha!

299
00:14:28,325 --> 00:14:30,995
So, before I'm tortured in the afterlife,

300
00:14:31,078 --> 00:14:34,415
I get to spend the rest of this life
in a Hungarian prison

301
00:14:34,498 --> 00:14:36,125
for destruction of art.

302
00:14:36,834 --> 00:14:37,918
That's fun.

303
00:14:38,002 --> 00:14:40,629
Destruction of extremely derivative art.

304
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:43,048
Kamilah's work
has been mediocre for years.

305
00:14:43,132 --> 00:14:47,136
Mother and Father are probably
rolling over in their cryogenic chambers.

306
00:14:47,219 --> 00:14:48,220
Really?

307
00:14:48,846 --> 00:14:50,806
You don't think they would be proud of her

308
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:54,143
for having a whole museum wing
dedicated to her work?

309
00:14:54,226 --> 00:14:59,648
My parents' standards were incredibly high
and they were impossible to please.

310
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:02,943
Plus, they always pitted
my sister and me against each other.

311
00:15:03,027 --> 00:15:04,820
The two of them were a unit and...

312
00:15:05,529 --> 00:15:06,906
Kamilah and I...

313
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,704
[Waqas] Girls,
we have a new challenge for you.

314
00:15:13,787 --> 00:15:16,957
Each of you has four hours
to complete a rendering

315
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:20,252
of your favorite moment
in French military history.

316
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:23,380
The winning painting
shall be hung in our foyer

317
00:15:23,464 --> 00:15:26,175
during our party
honoring François Mitterrand.

318
00:15:26,258 --> 00:15:29,345
The losing painting
shall provide the kindling for the fire

319
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:33,223
that rages in our hearth
during that party.

320
00:15:33,807 --> 00:15:35,267
Doesn't that sound wonderful?

321
00:15:35,351 --> 00:15:36,936
Yes, Mother. It does.

322
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:38,437
Thank you for this opportunity.

323
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:42,816
Who will be the winning artist
and who will fail?

324
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,360
Let's find out.

325
00:15:50,282 --> 00:15:51,116
[Tahani] These paintings...

326
00:15:54,328 --> 00:15:55,663
they're us.

327
00:15:55,746 --> 00:15:56,914
You're the boobs?

328
00:15:57,915 --> 00:16:00,125
Sorry. Once Jason said it,
that's all I can see.

329
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:05,714
Here we go.

330
00:16:06,507 --> 00:16:07,341
What?

331
00:16:09,301 --> 00:16:11,387
Tahani, what are you doing?
Stop it!

332
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:13,889
No, I'm going to hug you,
because I love you.

333
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:16,934
And because you feel
just as alone as I do.

334
00:16:18,018 --> 00:16:21,021
I'm sorry our parents were such wankers.

335
00:16:21,689 --> 00:16:24,191
And I understand
that you can't accept my apology

336
00:16:24,274 --> 00:16:26,902
because that would
quench your creative thirst.

337
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:29,613
They forced us to compete,

338
00:16:29,697 --> 00:16:32,741
and that competition
has fueled your art for decades.

339
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:36,996
It's so awful and I'm so sorry.

340
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:43,377
[sighs] They were wankers, weren't they?

341
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:48,382
Ah! The absolute biggest wankers on Earth.
[chuckles]

342
00:16:52,386 --> 00:16:53,721
Let them go, please.

343
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:56,223
{\an8}[speaking Hungarian]

344
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:03,939
Diana Tremaine, you little devil.

345
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:05,274
New name, same game.

346
00:17:05,357 --> 00:17:09,486
Fine. Things have been going good
with me and Dave.

347
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:12,573
But sometimes, I sneak
a little bit of cash out of his wallet

348
00:17:12,656 --> 00:17:15,617
and I hide it away,
just in case everything blows up

349
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:17,995
and I need to skip town.
Are you happy?

350
00:17:19,788 --> 00:17:23,542
Actually, no, I'm not happy,
but I think you are.

351
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:25,961
You're holding on to this exit strategy,

352
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:28,047
telling yourself
that you can bail at any time,

353
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:29,131
but the truth is...

354
00:17:30,507 --> 00:17:32,468
you love this suburban life.

355
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:34,595
I don't love it so much.

356
00:17:34,678 --> 00:17:37,890
I am not basic. Ya basic!

357
00:17:37,973 --> 00:17:41,101
No, Mom. Ya basic.

358
00:17:41,185 --> 00:17:43,937
And that's okay.
Let me ask you something.

359
00:17:44,521 --> 00:17:46,148
Why are you wearing yoga pants?

360
00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:49,109
Well, on Tuesday nights,
I do restorative yoga

361
00:17:49,193 --> 00:17:50,736
with a bunch of moms from Patty's school.

362
00:17:50,819 --> 00:17:51,987
And what do you do after yoga?

363
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:54,823
We split avocado egg rolls
at The Cheesecake Factory.

364
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:56,033
But we also drink.

365
00:17:56,116 --> 00:17:57,951
-What do you drink?
-Chardonnay.

366
00:17:58,869 --> 00:18:00,579
-With ice cubes.
-[sighs]

367
00:18:00,662 --> 00:18:02,706
And after one glass, I get sleepy.

368
00:18:03,373 --> 00:18:08,337
So I usually switch to water,
so I can drive home like a nerd!

369
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:09,713
Hey, hey.

370
00:18:11,173 --> 00:18:14,551
It's okay. It's good. You're happy here.

371
00:18:14,635 --> 00:18:17,513
But you need to commit to this,

372
00:18:18,972 --> 00:18:21,683
which means getting rid
of that stash of escape money.

373
00:18:23,185 --> 00:18:25,312
And I think you know
what you have to do with it.

374
00:18:27,022 --> 00:18:28,524
Send it to Gene Simmons?

375
00:18:28,607 --> 00:18:29,733
What? No.

376
00:18:30,859 --> 00:18:32,653
Spend it on Patricia.

377
00:18:33,487 --> 00:18:37,407
Set up a college fund. Buy her a crib.
Or a car.

378
00:18:37,491 --> 00:18:39,201
I truly don't know anything about kids.

379
00:18:39,284 --> 00:18:45,874
But this is your chance to break the chain
of Shellstrop mother-daughter crappiness.

380
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:48,293
You have a do-over.

381
00:18:49,086 --> 00:18:50,212
Use it.

382
00:18:50,295 --> 00:18:54,967
Oh, baby, it seems like
you've turned into a really good person,

383
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:56,802
and you clearly didn't get that from me.

384
00:18:56,885 --> 00:18:59,680
So, props to whoever helped you.

385
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:03,183
Is there more cash in your bra?

386
00:19:03,267 --> 00:19:05,227
Always. It's why I don't wash them.

387
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:10,357
I still can't believe
that police officer pulled you over

388
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,526
just to tell you
that you were driving perfectly.

389
00:19:12,609 --> 00:19:14,278
Why not? I was.

390
00:19:14,361 --> 00:19:18,365
There is an article in the paper
about Kamilah's latest art installation.

391
00:19:18,448 --> 00:19:19,283
And look.

392
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:24,913
<i>"A Fractured Inheritance</i>
by Kamilah Al-Jamil and Tahani Al-Jamil."

393
00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:27,875
Gosh. That's very big of her.

394
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:32,296
Though, she really should have
named the piece <i>The Buried Hatchet.</i>

395
00:19:32,379 --> 00:19:33,505
Don't you think?

396
00:19:33,589 --> 00:19:34,923
Such a better title.

397
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:36,717
I'm going to call her and rub it in.

398
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,594
Maybe don't. For now.

399
00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:40,929
Yes. Smart.

400
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:42,681
[Michael] Good luck, buddy.

401
00:19:42,764 --> 00:19:45,142
Oh, I almost forgot.
I sketched you up a little something.

402
00:19:45,225 --> 00:19:48,061
Some ideas there for your project.

403
00:19:48,145 --> 00:19:52,608
Wow! This is more than a few ideas.
You solved the whole thing.

404
00:19:52,691 --> 00:19:54,109
Columns and porticoes.

405
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:55,027
Uh-oh.

406
00:19:55,777 --> 00:19:58,155
Looks like you forgot
to include bathrooms. [chuckles]

407
00:19:58,238 --> 00:20:02,117
Oops! Just a little oversight.
I've certainly used a bathroom.

408
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:03,785
Just like anybody else.

409
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:07,331
Love to sit on the... the thing and just,
you know, shoot one out.

410
00:20:07,414 --> 00:20:09,166
Eleanor, I'll be in the car.

411
00:20:09,249 --> 00:20:11,501
[Eleanor] It was really nice
to meet you, Patricia.

412
00:20:11,585 --> 00:20:13,420
You've got a lot of people
who care about you here.

413
00:20:14,004 --> 00:20:16,256
And good luck with the...

414
00:20:17,299 --> 00:20:18,675
-SATs.
-I'm nine.

415
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:21,178
Whatever. Good luck in school. You get it.

416
00:20:24,556 --> 00:20:26,850
{\an8}The others are on their way back
from Budapest.

417
00:20:26,934 --> 00:20:28,936
{\an8}We'll be picking 'em up in a few hours.

418
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:34,524
{\an8}Be happy. Your mom found a better path
all on her own.

419
00:20:34,608 --> 00:20:36,193
{\an8}And you definitely helped Patricia.

420
00:20:36,276 --> 00:20:38,153
{\an8}-Double happy ending.
-I know.

421
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:41,949
{\an8}I'm just... I'm a little sad.
I'm glad my mom has changed,

422
00:20:42,032 --> 00:20:45,118
{\an8}but that doesn't fix all the damage
she did to me.

423
00:20:45,202 --> 00:20:48,830
{\an8}Let's face it. She's the reason
I could never get close to anyone.

424
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:51,625
{\an8}I never even told a boyfriend I love him.

425
00:20:53,168 --> 00:20:54,002
Oh, crap.

426
00:20:54,503 --> 00:20:55,337
Um...

427
00:20:56,713 --> 00:20:58,674
You remember how I told you

428
00:20:58,757 --> 00:21:01,051
that you knew everything important
about your life?

429
00:21:01,134 --> 00:21:04,930
Well, I wasn't thinking
about your afterlife life.

430
00:21:05,514 --> 00:21:09,017
In one of the reboots,
you and Chidi fell in love.

431
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:13,063
Deeply. And you told him
that you loved him

432
00:21:13,146 --> 00:21:16,233
and he told you that he loved you back.

433
00:21:17,734 --> 00:21:18,694
We did what now?

434
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:21,154
Do you wanna listen to a podcast, maybe?
