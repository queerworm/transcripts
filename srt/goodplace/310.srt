1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:05,714
{\an8}Holy forking shirtballs.
We're in the Good Place.

2
00:00:05,797 --> 00:00:08,633
Are we sure
we're in the actual Good Place?

3
00:00:08,717 --> 00:00:10,593
It's rather... carpeted.

4
00:00:10,677 --> 00:00:12,303
Yeah, I don't see any go-karts,

5
00:00:12,387 --> 00:00:16,224
much less go-karts being driven by monkeys
wearing sunglasses and Hawaiian shirts.

6
00:00:16,307 --> 00:00:17,183
-What?
-Don't.

7
00:00:17,267 --> 00:00:19,561
No, this is definitely
some part of the Good Place.

8
00:00:19,644 --> 00:00:21,020
Just take a deep breath.

9
00:00:21,104 --> 00:00:23,231
-[Chidi inhales deeply]
-Whoa! [sniffs]

10
00:00:23,314 --> 00:00:26,860
That smells like Typhoon Falls,
my favorite water park when I was a kid.

11
00:00:26,943 --> 00:00:33,366
Mmm. Chlorine, suntan lotion, Band-Aids
and a thick cloud of teen hormones.

12
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:35,035
When I was researching
my fake neighborhood,

13
00:00:35,118 --> 00:00:35,952
I learned about this.

14
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:39,039
The Good Place smells
like whatever makes you happiest.

15
00:00:39,664 --> 00:00:42,459
Warm pretzels. Or, no, wait.

16
00:00:43,126 --> 00:00:45,587
It's the smell of absolute moral truth?

17
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:47,297
Those two things have very similar smells.

18
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:51,342
I smell Blake Bortles
holding the Super Bowl MVP trophy

19
00:00:51,426 --> 00:00:54,596
as Dan Patrick says,
"This has to feel good, Blake,"

20
00:00:54,679 --> 00:00:56,473
and he says, "It sure does, Dan,

21
00:00:56,556 --> 00:00:59,893
and I owe it all
to my best friend Jason Mendoza."

22
00:00:59,976 --> 00:01:01,186
Also, weed.

23
00:01:01,269 --> 00:01:06,608
Mmm. To me, it smells like a curtain
closing between first class and economy.

24
00:01:06,691 --> 00:01:08,735
Ah! This truly is the Good Place.

25
00:01:08,818 --> 00:01:12,697
I don't think
we're in the main Good Place area.

26
00:01:12,781 --> 00:01:15,742
This seems like
this is some kind of a mail depot.

27
00:01:15,825 --> 00:01:19,537
So we're talkin' about mailmen now.
From heaven.

28
00:01:19,621 --> 00:01:20,872
Literally had that calendar

29
00:01:20,955 --> 00:01:22,749
-and I did not get past March.
-What?

30
00:01:22,832 --> 00:01:24,250
Don't. Okay.

31
00:01:24,334 --> 00:01:26,544
There are two key things
that we have to do.

32
00:01:26,628 --> 00:01:28,505
Make sure that no one can follow us.

33
00:01:28,588 --> 00:01:29,589
-Janet?
-On it.

34
00:01:32,675 --> 00:01:34,177
What's the second thing we have to do?

35
00:01:34,969 --> 00:01:36,304
Keep a low profile.

36
00:01:44,103 --> 00:01:47,065
Okay, if there's anyone in the building,
here's our cover story.

37
00:01:47,148 --> 00:01:50,235
{\an8}I'm an accountant.
You are a Neutral Janet.

38
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:53,947
{\an8}And you four won a contest.

39
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:55,365
{\an8}-Really?
-Really?

40
00:01:55,448 --> 00:01:57,826
{\an8}Okay, not that.
I'll come up with something better.

41
00:01:57,909 --> 00:02:00,286
{\an8}Why do we need a cover story at all?
These are the good guys.

42
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:02,455
{\an8}Let's just come clean and request asylum.

43
00:02:02,539 --> 00:02:04,165
{\an8}Yeah, man, we're refugees.

44
00:02:04,249 --> 00:02:07,168
{\an8}What kind of messed-up place
would turn away refugees?

45
00:02:07,252 --> 00:02:09,546
{\an8}The main thing I've learned
about the Good Place

46
00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:11,714
{\an8}is that they never break the rules.

47
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:15,552
{\an8}No way to guarantee they wouldn't send you
right down to the Bad Place.

48
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:17,011
{\an8}[Gwendolyn] What the heck
is going on in there?

49
00:02:17,095 --> 00:02:18,304
{\an8}-Um...
-[Janet clears throat]

50
00:02:18,388 --> 00:02:23,434
{\an8}Oh! Hi, there. I'm an accountant.
We're coming from Accounting.

51
00:02:23,518 --> 00:02:28,022
{\an8}And as we were climbing
through the mailbox, it blew up.

52
00:02:28,773 --> 00:02:32,068
{\an8}The explosion was caused by demons.
We were being chased by demons.

53
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:34,863
{\an8}And a Dracula.
There was a Dracula chasing us.

54
00:02:36,406 --> 00:02:38,491
{\an8}-Was there, though, Jason?
-Yeah.

55
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:41,494
{\an8}Maybe Drac blew up the mailbox
with his bazooka.

56
00:02:45,123 --> 00:02:47,667
{\an8}Well, geez, Louise,
I'm sure glad you're okay.

57
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:50,587
{\an8}My name's Gwendolyn.
Welcome to the Good Place.

58
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:54,090
{\an8}I'm Michael, and this is my Neutral Janet.

59
00:02:54,173 --> 00:02:56,009
{\an8}Hello. Also, not hello.

60
00:02:56,092 --> 00:02:59,387
{\an8}It's nothing to meet you.
End of statement.

61
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:03,349
Okay. And these four here are humans,
if you can believe it.

62
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:06,644
If I can believe it? Watch this.
I believe it!

63
00:03:06,728 --> 00:03:07,812
[laughs]

64
00:03:07,896 --> 00:03:09,022
Why are they here?

65
00:03:10,231 --> 00:03:12,108
Because they won a contest.

66
00:03:16,112 --> 00:03:21,910
Congratulations, guys! Come on in!
This is the Correspondence Center.

67
00:03:21,993 --> 00:03:25,955
Make yourselves at home.
There's a sofa, that's a bowl of fruit.

68
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:27,415
That's the door to the Good Place.

69
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:31,002
This is a fun paperweight
shaped like a little hat.

70
00:03:31,085 --> 00:03:35,673
I'm sorry. This right here
is the door to the Good Place?

71
00:03:35,757 --> 00:03:40,094
Well, it's a door to the Good Place,
but it won't open for you guys, though.

72
00:03:40,178 --> 00:03:43,473
The only door for humans
is the official entrance,

73
00:03:43,556 --> 00:03:46,142
which is 500 trillion miles
north-south-north of here.

74
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:48,144
So you're kinda just stuck inside.

75
00:03:48,937 --> 00:03:50,188
Wow.

76
00:03:50,271 --> 00:03:54,025
It's really weird that you guys
won a contest to be in this building.

77
00:03:54,108 --> 00:03:58,613
Well, you know, take that up
with the folks at <i>Weird Contest Magazine.</i>

78
00:03:58,696 --> 00:04:01,282
Hey, why don't we help you
clean up the mess in the mail room?

79
00:04:01,366 --> 00:04:03,952
Wow. Thanks! Did I win a contest?

80
00:04:04,035 --> 00:04:05,620
[all laughing]

81
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,915
Chidi and I will be right there.

82
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:13,294
-Chidi, help me.
-She said it's not gonna open.

83
00:04:13,378 --> 00:04:14,379
Fine.

84
00:04:16,297 --> 00:04:17,382
Oops.

85
00:04:19,384 --> 00:04:20,468
-Eleanor!
-What?

86
00:04:20,551 --> 00:04:22,553
This is how
I always got out of escape rooms.

87
00:04:22,637 --> 00:04:25,098
If you break enough stuff,
they open the door and kick you out.

88
00:04:25,181 --> 00:04:26,683
[Gwendolyn] Is everything okay in there?

89
00:04:28,184 --> 00:04:29,102
Yup.

90
00:04:29,185 --> 00:04:31,229
[Gwendolyn] Okay. No follow-up questions.

91
00:04:31,312 --> 00:04:34,983
Hey, there, Smashy, before you start
grabbin' any other throwin' lamps,

92
00:04:35,066 --> 00:04:36,067
you have anything you need to talk about?

93
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:38,278
I can't take this anymore, man.

94
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:41,906
All the running, and hiding, and fighting
and this whole insane journey.

95
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:45,868
And now, all that stands between us
and the actual Good Place is one door?

96
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:47,495
What is that, two inches thick?

97
00:04:47,578 --> 00:04:51,833
That's like four Oreos!
We're four Oreos from heaven!

98
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:56,921
I know. I know. I know.
It's an insane situation.

99
00:04:57,005 --> 00:05:00,883
But I am right here with you.
So, let's take a deep breath.

100
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:02,927
[both inhale deeply]

101
00:05:03,011 --> 00:05:04,137
[both exhale]

102
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:08,016
Okay. The smell of the barf
from the wave pool is really helping.

103
00:05:08,599 --> 00:05:09,642
How?

104
00:05:11,102 --> 00:05:12,020
Why?

105
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:13,980
-Say, Gwendolyn...
-Mmm-hmm?

106
00:05:14,605 --> 00:05:18,109
I need to speak with the Committee
regarding an urgent matter.

107
00:05:18,192 --> 00:05:22,280
Sorry, you'd have to contact them directly
and that's definitely against the rules.

108
00:05:22,363 --> 00:05:27,076
I see. How would I contact them, though,
if it weren't against the rules?

109
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,203
Well, by calling them on that phone.

110
00:05:29,287 --> 00:05:30,788
-But I can't let you use it.
-Right.

111
00:05:30,872 --> 00:05:32,749
And even if it weren't against the rules,

112
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:35,168
I don't know the number,
and you wouldn't tell me.

113
00:05:35,251 --> 00:05:38,046
[laughing] I couldn't.
There are no numbers.

114
00:05:38,129 --> 00:05:40,798
You pick it up and it connects you
to whomever you want.

115
00:05:40,882 --> 00:05:44,093
-But you can't use it.
-Of course not.

116
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:45,887
-Just as a hypothetical...
-Mmm-hmm?

117
00:05:46,471 --> 00:05:50,391
Is there any way that you would know
if I did use the phone?

118
00:05:50,475 --> 00:05:51,893
Any kind of alarm?

119
00:05:51,976 --> 00:05:53,144
Golly, no!

120
00:05:53,227 --> 00:05:55,271
So it's entirely untraceable?

121
00:05:55,354 --> 00:05:57,982
Sure is. What a fun thought experiment.

122
00:05:58,066 --> 00:05:59,484
-You said it, Gwendolyn.
-Uh-huh.

123
00:05:59,567 --> 00:06:03,905
Sorry, is that a dog barking
in another room?

124
00:06:03,988 --> 00:06:06,157
I doubt it because I don't have a dog.

125
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:11,037
But out of politeness and an abundance
of caution, I'll go check. [chuckles]

126
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,331
Hello? Doggie?

127
00:06:14,123 --> 00:06:16,375
My name is Michael. I'm an accountant.

128
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:18,836
I need to speak
with the Committee immediately

129
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:22,673
on the top floor
of the Correspondence Center. Thank you.

130
00:06:28,429 --> 00:06:32,183
Jason, you seem thoughtful.
And that concerns me.

131
00:06:32,266 --> 00:06:34,977
Do you remember that one time
when we were in Janet's void,

132
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:36,687
and we all looked like Janet?

133
00:06:37,271 --> 00:06:38,981
I do, yes.

134
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:41,442
You know how I saw that thing
about how Janet loves me?

135
00:06:41,526 --> 00:06:43,528
I don't know how I feel about her,

136
00:06:43,611 --> 00:06:46,864
and also, I feel bad
that I sort of read her diary

137
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:49,367
and she doesn't know.
What should I do?

138
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:53,037
Well, perhaps you should tell Janet
what you saw.

139
00:06:53,121 --> 00:06:55,456
And start a dialogue about your feelings.

140
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:57,166
Who knows
if a relationship will take hold,

141
00:06:57,250 --> 00:07:00,336
but you must begin
from a place of honesty.

142
00:07:00,419 --> 00:07:04,340
Thanks, Tahani. It's nice to know
I can talk about girls with my wife.

143
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:06,759
Hey, Janet.

144
00:07:07,343 --> 00:07:10,847
Uh. So, do you remember how you killed us
and brought us into your void?

145
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:11,848
I do, yes.

146
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:14,559
When we were in there,
I was wandering around,

147
00:07:14,642 --> 00:07:17,103
because you have the ability
to make anything,

148
00:07:17,186 --> 00:07:19,147
and I wanted to see
where you keep the Rollerblades.

149
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:23,276
And I accidentally saw that video thing
about how you love me.

150
00:07:23,359 --> 00:07:26,070
You saw that? That's so embarrassing.

151
00:07:26,154 --> 00:07:29,740
It kinda freaked me out at first.
But, hey, let's talk about it.

152
00:07:29,824 --> 00:07:31,534
I don't want to talk about this.

153
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:34,495
You guys were in my void,
and it was exhausting,

154
00:07:34,579 --> 00:07:36,873
and I almost blew up,
and I have to be neutral,

155
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:38,875
and Neutral Janets don't have feelings...

156
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:40,042
How's it going in here?

157
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:43,087
It is going neutrally.
End of conversation.

158
00:07:43,171 --> 00:07:45,089
-Can we just--
-End of conversation.

159
00:07:46,716 --> 00:07:48,176
You got one shot, buddy.

160
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:53,431
Be clear, be confident,
and don't let them intimidate you.

161
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,726
Oh, wow!

162
00:07:56,809 --> 00:07:58,644
[Kellen] Wow. This place is very cool.

163
00:07:58,728 --> 00:08:00,313
[Paula] Have you guys
ever been here before?

164
00:08:00,396 --> 00:08:02,398
-No. No.
-I have never been here before.

165
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:04,025
-It's great.
-I love it. So charming.

166
00:08:04,108 --> 00:08:05,193
-[Meg] I love the architecture.
-[Chuck] Really great.

167
00:08:05,276 --> 00:08:08,863
Hello, everyone. I'm Michael.
Thank you for coming.

168
00:08:08,946 --> 00:08:11,407
No, thank you for asking us to come.

169
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:16,621
It is one of the great honors
of my eternal life to be invited here

170
00:08:16,704 --> 00:08:18,956
by you, today,
for this momentous occasion.

171
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:22,543
Now, who are you
and why are we here?

172
00:08:22,627 --> 00:08:26,380
Well, in a nutshell,
I believe that the Bad Place

173
00:08:26,464 --> 00:08:29,550
has somehow infiltrated
the Accounting Department,

174
00:08:30,301 --> 00:08:31,969
and is tampering with the points system.

175
00:08:32,053 --> 00:08:34,931
My goodness. That would be a disaster.

176
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:36,390
Everyone focus up.

177
00:08:36,474 --> 00:08:37,892
Meg, you take notes.

178
00:08:37,975 --> 00:08:40,895
Daisuke, open a secure channel
to headquarters.

179
00:08:40,978 --> 00:08:43,940
Kellen, head to the farmers' market
and grab us fresh peaches.

180
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:45,566
I think pluots are in season.

181
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:47,068
Then get pluots, Kellen.

182
00:08:47,151 --> 00:08:49,612
Get as many pluots
as can fit in your tote bag.

183
00:08:49,695 --> 00:08:51,405
We are gonna be here a while.

184
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:53,908
[Chidi] Brought you some water.

185
00:08:53,991 --> 00:08:55,576
Well, I mean, there's not a kitchen,

186
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:59,413
but I found this kind of glowing bowl
with liquid in it.

187
00:08:59,497 --> 00:09:01,040
Maybe it was a toilet.
I'm gonna throw this out.

188
00:09:01,624 --> 00:09:03,334
-What are you doing?
-Trying to jimmy the lock,

189
00:09:03,417 --> 00:09:07,421
but everything I stick in here
just turns to glitter. Ugh!

190
00:09:07,505 --> 00:09:09,549
All right, forget about the door,
look at me.

191
00:09:09,632 --> 00:09:13,219
Right now,
we're together in heaven, basically.

192
00:09:13,302 --> 00:09:14,929
And we're in love.

193
00:09:15,012 --> 00:09:18,558
Compared to some of the other stuff
that's happened to us, it could be worse.

194
00:09:18,641 --> 00:09:22,645
Yes, "try and enjoy this" is a better plan
than "have the anxiety sweats."

195
00:09:23,479 --> 00:09:25,481
Check it out.
Straight through my sweatshirt.

196
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:28,818
Cool. Hey, I have an idea
to take your mind off the door.

197
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:30,528
-Let's go on a date.
-What?

198
00:09:30,611 --> 00:09:31,654
No, I'm serious.

199
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:35,825
Why not have our first date
four Oreos away from paradise?

200
00:09:35,908 --> 00:09:38,786
You still wanna go out with me
after I just showed you my anxiety sweats?

201
00:09:38,869 --> 00:09:40,955
Man, you must really be into me.

202
00:09:41,539 --> 00:09:43,624
You have to admit, it's very odd

203
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:47,753
that no one has gotten into the Good Place
for 500 years.

204
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:49,463
[Chuck] Well, there've been dips before.

205
00:09:49,547 --> 00:09:52,633
Remember, like, 200,000 years ago
when they invented stabbing,

206
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:54,468
and they were all just, like,
stabbing each other?

207
00:09:54,552 --> 00:09:56,846
Again, I urge you to look at Doug Forcett.

208
00:09:56,929 --> 00:10:02,143
The man has lived a selfless life
and he's not even close to getting in.

209
00:10:02,226 --> 00:10:07,815
The only explanation is that the Bad Place
has somehow rigged the system.

210
00:10:07,898 --> 00:10:09,191
[Meg] I wouldn't put it past them.

211
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:12,570
Every single Bad Place employee
is a disgusting monster.

212
00:10:13,154 --> 00:10:17,658
Well, some of them are probably cool,
handsome, man-about-town types.

213
00:10:18,242 --> 00:10:22,788
Committee, Michael the accountant
has brought us evidence of a problem,

214
00:10:22,872 --> 00:10:25,416
and now it is up to us to find a solution.

215
00:10:25,499 --> 00:10:28,794
While you wait, Kellen will stand by you,
showering you with compliments.

216
00:10:29,378 --> 00:10:32,381
Great job, Michael.
You are such a good speaker.

217
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:35,426
This suit is very flattering.
You have a lot of gravitas.

218
00:10:35,509 --> 00:10:39,430
I thought I was going to be
annoyed by this, but it's wonderful.

219
00:10:39,513 --> 00:10:42,433
Your jawline is extraordinary.
You're a nice height.

220
00:10:42,516 --> 00:10:44,435
Your energy is electric.

221
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:49,690
I gotta say, it's been really nice
having a little company.

222
00:10:49,774 --> 00:10:54,362
It's nice to be here...
and it's not nice to not be there.

223
00:10:55,529 --> 00:10:58,199
So, how'd you two meet?
Was it through the contest?

224
00:10:58,282 --> 00:11:00,034
Tahani and I met in Brain School.

225
00:11:00,117 --> 00:11:02,578
And then we got married
because nothing mattered.

226
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:06,165
And you're both so attractive.
Are all humans as attractive as you two?

227
00:11:06,248 --> 00:11:07,875
[laughing]

228
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:09,710
-No.
-[Gwendolyn] Fantastic.

229
00:11:09,794 --> 00:11:13,339
Say, Jason, can you help me get more
wicker baskets from the other room?

230
00:11:13,422 --> 00:11:14,507
Sure thing.

231
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:17,134
I'm so sorry, darling.
This is all my fault.

232
00:11:17,218 --> 00:11:20,096
I encouraged Jason to come clean
about what we saw.

233
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:21,222
You saw that, too?

234
00:11:21,806 --> 00:11:23,265
-No.
-[Janet groans]

235
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:24,600
Jason knows that I love him.

236
00:11:24,683 --> 00:11:27,853
It stinks to hear
about how the two of you are married,

237
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:30,773
this beige outfit
really washes out my not-skin,

238
00:11:30,856 --> 00:11:33,192
and if I don't remain neutral
in front of Gwendolyn,

239
00:11:33,275 --> 00:11:34,402
she's gonna know we've been lying.

240
00:11:34,485 --> 00:11:36,654
All of these new emotions I'm feeling
are about to burst out of me,

241
00:11:36,737 --> 00:11:39,323
which might be super embarrassing.

242
00:11:39,407 --> 00:11:41,409
What if they come out my butt?

243
00:11:47,289 --> 00:11:49,166
-Whoa! Champagne!
-Found it in the cupboard.

244
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:50,084
I think it was a gift.

245
00:11:50,167 --> 00:11:52,628
I feel kinda bad. What if
it was for something really important?

246
00:11:52,711 --> 00:11:56,006
"Gwendolyn, here's some champagne for you
for thanking me for thanking you

247
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:57,466
for thanking me for thanking you

248
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:59,260
for thanking me
for the champagne you sent me."

249
00:11:59,343 --> 00:12:01,846
-Pop that bench!
-[gasps]

250
00:12:03,013 --> 00:12:04,723
This is my kind of scrappy fun.

251
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:08,144
Sneaking around with a boy,
trying not to get caught.

252
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:12,189
I know. It's like when my parents
would go to a symposium

253
00:12:12,273 --> 00:12:16,152
and I would sneak into their office
and read the unabridged dictionary.

254
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:20,156
-I can't believe I'm attracted to you.
-You are, though.

255
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:22,658
I'm not worried about that anymore.
You blew it when you admitted it to me.

256
00:12:22,741 --> 00:12:23,617
[Eleanor chuckles]

257
00:12:24,326 --> 00:12:26,412
You still thinking about
what's on the other side of that door?

258
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:30,958
Not really, no.
Because you're here with me, on this side.

259
00:12:32,501 --> 00:12:37,006
I have one more little surprise for you.

260
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:39,216
Okay, open 'em.

261
00:12:41,302 --> 00:12:44,096
Holy forking fork!

262
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:46,348
-What do you think?
-[Eleanor sighs]

263
00:12:48,684 --> 00:12:52,730
Oh, no, you're crying.
I assume it's because you're happy.

264
00:12:52,813 --> 00:12:54,398
Or horny. Is this a horny cry?

265
00:12:54,482 --> 00:12:57,651
No. I'm crying because I'm miserable,
and it's all your fault.

266
00:12:57,735 --> 00:12:58,694
Why? Do you not like the outfit?

267
00:12:58,777 --> 00:13:01,071
I love the outfit! You look amazing!

268
00:13:01,155 --> 00:13:03,365
And this sucks, and I'm furious!

269
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:06,869
And I'm the happiest I've ever been,
and I blame you! [sobbing]

270
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:14,126
In light of this new information,
the time has come to take decisive action.

271
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:15,127
Wow.

272
00:13:15,794 --> 00:13:18,672
Can't tell you how happy I am
to hear you say that.

273
00:13:18,756 --> 00:13:21,091
We're gonna form
an elite investigative team

274
00:13:21,175 --> 00:13:22,426
to get to the bottom of this.

275
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:24,261
And we are fast-tracking the process.

276
00:13:24,345 --> 00:13:27,431
It'll take no more than 400 years.

277
00:13:28,182 --> 00:13:30,476
-Sorry?
-It's aggressive, but you heard right.

278
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:35,147
We are only giving ourselves 400 years
to select the members of this elite team.

279
00:13:35,231 --> 00:13:38,067
Wait, 400 years just to form the team?

280
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:40,444
I was thinking
that we could do something now-ish.

281
00:13:40,528 --> 00:13:41,779
Like, right now.

282
00:13:41,862 --> 00:13:44,365
Michael, we have rules, procedures.

283
00:13:44,448 --> 00:13:45,783
We're the good guys.

284
00:13:45,866 --> 00:13:47,952
-We can't just do stuff.
-No.

285
00:13:48,035 --> 00:13:50,704
Upon formation, the team
will then be in charge of organizing

286
00:13:50,788 --> 00:13:55,125
a blue ribbon commission
to investigate themselves

287
00:13:55,209 --> 00:13:56,544
to make sure
there's no conflicts of interest.

288
00:13:56,627 --> 00:13:59,380
And that will take 1,000 years.

289
00:13:59,463 --> 00:14:00,297
Okay.

290
00:14:01,632 --> 00:14:04,385
Just so you know,
the whole time you're doing this,

291
00:14:04,468 --> 00:14:10,891
the bad guys are continuing to torture
everyone who ends up in the Bad Place.

292
00:14:10,975 --> 00:14:12,977
Which is everyone!

293
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:14,853
And that deeply concerns us.

294
00:14:14,937 --> 00:14:16,689
Have you seen the memoranda
we've sent each other

295
00:14:16,772 --> 00:14:20,109
about how concerned we are?
We're taking this very seriously.

296
00:14:20,192 --> 00:14:21,110
Hear, hear.

297
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:23,863
Ooh, Kellen, did you file
a "hear, hear" memorandum?

298
00:14:23,946 --> 00:14:26,073
No. Sincerest apologies.

299
00:14:26,156 --> 00:14:29,285
I rescind my "hear, hear" and resign,
effective immediately.

300
00:14:34,248 --> 00:14:37,001
Hey, you two. I think I may have solved
one part of our little problem.

301
00:14:38,043 --> 00:14:40,296
I made up
a "Death Did Us Part" certificate

302
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:42,631
explaining that
since Jason and I are dead,

303
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:45,050
we are officially no longer fake married.

304
00:14:45,134 --> 00:14:47,177
I know it's not your main concern,

305
00:14:47,261 --> 00:14:50,890
but whatever part of you was vexed
by our silly arrangement,

306
00:14:50,973 --> 00:14:52,099
you can now both relax.

307
00:14:52,683 --> 00:14:56,520
I can tell by your silence
and inability to make eye contact with me

308
00:14:56,604 --> 00:14:58,480
that I've knocked it out of the park.

309
00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:02,318
It's a nice gesture.
I feel both pitied and put on the spot.

310
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:04,612
So... that's fun.

311
00:15:04,695 --> 00:15:07,698
And it's a cool reminder of how I'm...

312
00:15:07,781 --> 00:15:08,657
dead.

313
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:12,036
Well, forget it. Never mind.
Misfire. Watch this.

314
00:15:13,829 --> 00:15:15,331
{\an8}There. Canceled.

315
00:15:15,414 --> 00:15:16,624
So, you and I are married again?

316
00:15:16,707 --> 00:15:17,917
No, we're not. Um...

317
00:15:19,376 --> 00:15:20,210
[exclaims]

318
00:15:20,294 --> 00:15:21,295
[chuckles]

319
00:15:22,254 --> 00:15:23,339
[Eleanor sobbing]

320
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:26,342
It's okay. Cry as long as you want.

321
00:15:27,009 --> 00:15:28,469
I'm going to. [sniffling]

322
00:15:29,511 --> 00:15:31,388
'Cause my tears
taste like the nacho cheese

323
00:15:31,472 --> 00:15:32,890
from my favorite movie theater.

324
00:15:32,973 --> 00:15:35,643
It's a really weird incentive
to keep crying.

325
00:15:35,726 --> 00:15:38,062
[scoffs] Relationships are stupid.

326
00:15:38,812 --> 00:15:40,814
You're scared
you're never gonna have a real one,

327
00:15:40,898 --> 00:15:43,817
and then when you do,
you're scared it's gonna go away.

328
00:15:43,901 --> 00:15:47,696
But here's an idea. What if we don't worry
about whatever comes next?

329
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:51,325
There's a quote I like by Tolstoy.

330
00:15:51,408 --> 00:15:56,163
"There is only one time that is important.
Now.

331
00:15:56,246 --> 00:15:58,290
It is the only time when we

332
00:15:58,374 --> 00:15:59,458
-have any power."
-"Have any power."

333
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:00,876
I know that quote.

334
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:04,213
An unverified Tyra Banks account
posted that meme on Instagram.

335
00:16:04,296 --> 00:16:06,090
Well, now I hate it.

336
00:16:06,173 --> 00:16:07,508
[laughs softly]

337
00:16:07,591 --> 00:16:08,926
There is another quote,

338
00:16:09,009 --> 00:16:14,807
first spoken by a very wise,
very attractive,

339
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:19,979
occasionally very sweaty philosopher.
"You gotta try."

340
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:24,400
Now, she was talking about
making the world a better place,

341
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:26,402
but I think it applies
to relationships, too.

342
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:28,862
I've got an idea
of something we could try.

343
00:16:28,946 --> 00:16:30,406
Great! What?

344
00:16:31,573 --> 00:16:32,741
Oh!

345
00:16:33,367 --> 00:16:34,743
Wait. I think I know.

346
00:16:35,494 --> 00:16:36,495
Well, I don't want to assume.

347
00:16:36,578 --> 00:16:40,624
What if we both write down
what we think you mean?

348
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:42,459
-What if we didn't?
-And then-- Oh! Ah.

349
00:16:45,754 --> 00:16:49,049
Michael, how did it go?
Is the Committee going to help us?

350
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:52,928
The Committee is a bunch
of ineffectual dorks in fleece vests.

351
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:54,513
The <i>Titanic</i> is sinking,

352
00:16:54,596 --> 00:16:58,017
and they're writing
a strongly-worded letter to the iceberg.

353
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:00,894
I mean, how much more evidence
do they need?

354
00:17:00,978 --> 00:17:04,273
The Bad Place
has to be tampering with the system.

355
00:17:04,356 --> 00:17:05,816
There's no other explanation.

356
00:17:07,234 --> 00:17:08,652
Can I ask you an unrelated question?

357
00:17:08,736 --> 00:17:10,237
Absolutely not.

358
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:13,866
The fate of all of humanity is at stake
and time is running out.

359
00:17:16,493 --> 00:17:17,494
Go ahead.

360
00:17:17,578 --> 00:17:20,831
I'm trying to help Jason and Janet
navigate some very complex feelings,

361
00:17:20,914 --> 00:17:22,624
but everything I do makes it worse.

362
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:26,003
You know them better than anyone else.
How do I just make them happy?

363
00:17:26,086 --> 00:17:27,588
How do you make Jason happy?

364
00:17:27,671 --> 00:17:30,924
You give him a lollipop
shaped like a Transformer.

365
00:17:31,008 --> 00:17:32,760
You'd think it'd be that simple.

366
00:17:32,843 --> 00:17:36,555
But every time I do something nice,
it backfires.

367
00:17:36,638 --> 00:17:41,643
There are so many unintended consequences
to well-intentioned actions.

368
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:43,979
It feels like a game you can't win.

369
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:45,397
That's it.

370
00:17:47,149 --> 00:17:50,319
There is another explanation.
Unintended consequences.

371
00:17:50,402 --> 00:17:54,031
-Tahani, you did it.
-Well, of course I did, darling.

372
00:17:55,115 --> 00:17:55,949
Did what?

373
00:17:56,033 --> 00:17:58,202
All along, I've only been looking
at one Doug,

374
00:17:58,285 --> 00:18:02,039
but there's millions of Dougs in here.

375
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:08,462
In 1534, Douglass Wynegarr
of Hawkhurst, England,

376
00:18:08,545 --> 00:18:11,006
gave his grandmother roses
for her birthday.

377
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:13,550
He picked them himself,
walked them over to her,

378
00:18:13,634 --> 00:18:16,303
she was happy, boom, 145 points.

379
00:18:17,012 --> 00:18:19,348
Now... yeah, here we go.

380
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:25,062
In 2009, Doug Ewing
of Scaggsville, Maryland,

381
00:18:25,145 --> 00:18:31,318
also gave his grandmother a dozen roses,
but he lost four points.

382
00:18:31,401 --> 00:18:36,532
Why? Because he ordered roses using
a cell phone that was made in a sweatshop.

383
00:18:37,282 --> 00:18:40,285
The flowers were grown
with toxic pesticides,

384
00:18:40,369 --> 00:18:42,621
picked by exploited migrant workers,

385
00:18:42,704 --> 00:18:47,417
delivered from thousands of miles away,
which created a massive carbon footprint,

386
00:18:47,501 --> 00:18:50,754
and his money
went to a billionaire racist CEO,

387
00:18:50,838 --> 00:18:55,759
who sends his female employees
pictures of his genitals. Whoo!

388
00:18:56,552 --> 00:18:58,679
That is a very odd thing to cheer.

389
00:18:58,762 --> 00:18:59,763
[Michael] Don't you understand?

390
00:18:59,847 --> 00:19:02,141
The Bad Place isn't tampering with points.
They don't have to.

391
00:19:02,224 --> 00:19:05,644
Because every day,
the world gets a little more complicated,

392
00:19:05,727 --> 00:19:08,814
and being a good person
gets a little harder.

393
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:10,899
Gather the others. We have a lot to do.

394
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:12,568
But we really didn't deal with my thing.

395
00:19:13,569 --> 00:19:17,114
Okay. I'll just figure it out. [sighs]

396
00:19:18,574 --> 00:19:22,578
Janet, I owe you an apology.
I'm very sorry I meddled.

397
00:19:22,661 --> 00:19:25,706
Truly, I was only trying to help
because I want you two to be happy,

398
00:19:25,789 --> 00:19:31,545
and because, well, I love you.
I really do. I love you both.

399
00:19:33,213 --> 00:19:35,716
Oh, no. I'm sorry.
Did I say something wrong again?

400
00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:38,719
No. I'm just crying because
you're such a nice and thoughtful friend.

401
00:19:38,802 --> 00:19:40,762
And the emotions
aren't coming out of my butt.

402
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:43,515
They're coming out of my eyes,
which is somehow just as embarrassing.

403
00:19:44,099 --> 00:19:46,560
-Why are you crying?
-I don't know.

404
00:19:46,643 --> 00:19:48,478
I'm British. I never cry.

405
00:19:48,562 --> 00:19:52,232
But you're saying these nice things
about me, and it's making me cry.

406
00:19:52,316 --> 00:19:56,695
And also, this is less important,
but the carpeting is really disgusting.

407
00:19:57,321 --> 00:19:58,155
Oh!

408
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:02,826
[Jason cries]

409
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:04,286
Why are you crying?

410
00:20:04,369 --> 00:20:07,039
I just like being a part of things.

411
00:20:07,122 --> 00:20:08,749
Oh, Jason.

412
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:13,086
Two humans and a Neutral Janet crying?
In the Good Place?

413
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:17,382
I've never been suspicious of anyone,
but I think that's about to change.

414
00:20:17,466 --> 00:20:18,383
No reason to be suspicious.

415
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:21,345
I promise you,
we've done nothing untoward.

416
00:20:21,428 --> 00:20:24,348
What's up, fartfaces?
Chidi and I just had sex in a closet.

417
00:20:25,807 --> 00:20:28,769
Michael, have you all been lying to me
this whole time?

418
00:20:28,852 --> 00:20:32,356
That upsets me.
I'm gonna try to shake my fist at you.

419
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:35,025
Oh, gosh, darn it!

420
00:20:35,108 --> 00:20:38,028
I have no choice.
I have to turn you in to the Judge.

421
00:20:38,111 --> 00:20:40,739
Don't bother. I already did.

422
00:20:42,532 --> 00:20:45,118
{\an8}Hey, Frogman.
The Judge agreed to your terms.

423
00:20:45,202 --> 00:20:46,703
{\an8}She'll meet you at IHOP.

424
00:20:46,787 --> 00:20:49,456
{\an8}So this is the Good Place, huh? Hmm.

425
00:20:50,374 --> 00:20:51,875
{\an8}[sniffing]

426
00:20:51,959 --> 00:20:53,335
{\an8}Smells like frogs.

427
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:56,755
{\an8}Cool. Let's go.

428
00:20:56,838 --> 00:20:58,465
{\an8}Sorry, did he just say
we're going to IHOP?

429
00:20:58,548 --> 00:21:00,008
{\an8}-Yes.
-Tight.

430
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:01,385
{\an8}[Michael] No. Not tight.

431
00:21:01,468 --> 00:21:03,512
{\an8}The Interdimensional Hole of Pancakes

432
00:21:03,595 --> 00:21:05,472
{\an8}is the most dangerous place
in the universe.

433
00:21:05,555 --> 00:21:06,640
{\an8}Then why are we going?

434
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:08,392
{\an8}To save humanity.

435
00:21:08,475 --> 00:21:10,644
{\an8}Great. Any chance I can change real quick?

436
00:21:10,727 --> 00:21:12,521
{\an8}-Nope.
-Cool.

437
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:19,569
Bye, guys! Nice to meet you!
