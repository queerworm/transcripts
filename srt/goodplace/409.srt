1
00:00:01,918 --> 00:00:04,004
Not in this Janet. Next!

2
00:00:09,551 --> 00:00:10,885
What are you waiting for? Do it.

3
00:00:10,969 --> 00:00:12,470
It's not that easy.

4
00:00:12,554 --> 00:00:15,807
He lived a whole life,
and then 802 afterlives,

5
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:18,143
then a second life,
then a second afterlife,

6
00:00:18,226 --> 00:00:19,978
then a third first afterlife...

7
00:00:20,061 --> 00:00:24,065
His psyche's like
a giant bowl of M&amp;M Peep chili.

8
00:00:24,149 --> 00:00:27,068
I gotta make sure all the memories go
in the right place, in the right order.

9
00:00:27,152 --> 00:00:30,030
Maybe I just start him at the beginning.
A full factory reset.

10
00:00:30,113 --> 00:00:32,991
Man. Janet, can I please have a drink
with a lot of alcohol in it?

11
00:00:33,074 --> 00:00:35,910
Here, I saved this from my funeral.
It's called a Duval Ditchwater.

12
00:00:35,994 --> 00:00:38,121
It's Midori, Coffee-Mate and ditch water!

13
00:00:38,204 --> 00:00:39,956
-I'll get you a margarita.
-Yeah, that sounds better.

14
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:41,624
It's not! Seriously, try this.

15
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:43,585
-Okay, here we go.
-[Jason] Whoa--

16
00:01:00,602 --> 00:01:01,728
[Ndeye chuckles] Ooh.

17
00:01:01,811 --> 00:01:03,229
[Emeka] He has your eyes.

18
00:01:03,313 --> 00:01:04,898
[Ndeye] And your smile.

19
00:01:04,981 --> 00:01:07,400
-Now, he just needs a name.
-[Emeka] Big decision.

20
00:01:07,484 --> 00:01:10,737
-How about Chidi?
-[Ndeye] Oh, I like that.

21
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:14,407
Do you like it, Chidi?
Or would you like a different name?

22
00:01:14,491 --> 00:01:16,534
-[crying]
-[Ndeye chuckles] Oh.

23
00:01:16,618 --> 00:01:18,161
Looks like he has a tummyache.

24
00:01:18,244 --> 00:01:19,079
[Emeka] Oh.

25
00:01:19,162 --> 00:01:20,038
[Ndeye] Chidi.

26
00:01:26,711 --> 00:01:29,422
[Emeka] You're not listening to me.
Everything always has to be your way.

27
00:01:29,506 --> 00:01:31,049
[Ndeye] And what is
the one right way then?

28
00:01:31,132 --> 00:01:33,384
I mean, how many times
have I told you this?

29
00:01:33,468 --> 00:01:34,803
[Emeka] I thought
this is what you wanted.

30
00:01:34,886 --> 00:01:36,513
[Ndeye] No!
It's obviously what you want.

31
00:01:36,596 --> 00:01:38,890
You're just angry
that your book was rejected.

32
00:01:38,973 --> 00:01:40,183
[Emeka] How dare
you bring that up again?

33
00:01:40,266 --> 00:01:42,101
[Ndeye] You're always
at the university.

34
00:01:42,185 --> 00:01:46,189
{\an8}How about you show some interest
in someone who didn't die 200 years ago?

35
00:01:46,272 --> 00:01:47,649
{\an8}[Emeka] I don't know how much longer
I can keep this up.

36
00:01:47,732 --> 00:01:48,817
{\an8}We need to go back to Nigeria.

37
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:50,693
[Ndeye] No, we are not going back.

38
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:53,530
My family is here
and we did this for your career.

39
00:01:53,613 --> 00:01:55,031
-[Emeka] Oh.
-[door slams]

40
00:01:56,908 --> 00:01:59,577
{\an8}-Good morning, Chidi.
-Would you like some breakfast?

41
00:01:59,661 --> 00:02:01,079
{\an8}[Chidi] I have a presentation.

42
00:02:01,162 --> 00:02:04,124
{\an8}Here's the syllabus.
Take one and pass them on.

43
00:02:04,207 --> 00:02:07,293
My lecture will take
approximately 55 minutes.

44
00:02:07,377 --> 00:02:09,587
Let's begin, shall we?

45
00:02:10,213 --> 00:02:13,967
{\an8}In conclusion, there is one clear answer,

46
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:16,761
{\an8}and it's that the two of you
should stay married.

47
00:02:16,845 --> 00:02:18,096
{\an8}Questions?

48
00:02:18,179 --> 00:02:23,351
{\an8}[sighs] That was clear... and persuasive.

49
00:02:23,434 --> 00:02:25,436
{\an8}And you have made a strong case.

50
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,857
{\an8}Yes, well-argued. Better than
some of my grad students. [chuckles]

51
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:30,942
{\an8}You should get ready for school.
I'll take you.

52
00:02:31,025 --> 00:02:32,694
{\an8}We'll both take you.

53
00:02:35,071 --> 00:02:37,115
{\an8}-[Uzo] It worked?
-Perfectly.

54
00:02:37,198 --> 00:02:38,491
{\an8}They're happy again, Uzo.

55
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:40,410
{\an8}They're even talking
about getting me a puppy.

56
00:02:40,493 --> 00:02:43,663
{\an8}But more importantly,
I proved once and for all

57
00:02:43,746 --> 00:02:45,915
{\an8}that you can always find the answer.

58
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:50,461
{\an8}-The answer to what?
-To anything. Every problem has an answer.

59
00:02:50,545 --> 00:02:52,839
{\an8}If you just read enough books
and think hard enough,

60
00:02:52,922 --> 00:02:55,174
{\an8}you can figure out
the answer to any question.

61
00:02:55,258 --> 00:02:58,052
{\an8}I know you're really smart,
but that sounds wrong.

62
00:02:58,136 --> 00:03:00,096
{\an8}Children? Please take your seats.

63
00:03:00,179 --> 00:03:03,892
{\an8}Here's a perfect example.
Where to sit? What's the answer?

64
00:03:03,975 --> 00:03:07,228
Obviously, we want to be back
by the pencil sharpener,

65
00:03:07,312 --> 00:03:09,731
but in the front,
I can see the blackboard better,

66
00:03:10,398 --> 00:03:13,192
or by the door to get a nice breeze?

67
00:03:13,276 --> 00:03:14,694
-Chidi?
-[Chidi] Just hang on.

68
00:03:14,777 --> 00:03:16,404
Sorry.

69
00:03:16,988 --> 00:03:18,489
Oh, no.

70
00:03:25,622 --> 00:03:28,875
I still say Professor Lindeman
was a fool to abandon Chidi.

71
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:31,002
He has a brilliant mind.

72
00:03:31,085 --> 00:03:33,922
One day, he will use it to solve
the world's biggest problems.

73
00:03:34,005 --> 00:03:36,007
Is this enough cheese?
I hope this is enough cheese.

74
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:37,926
There's sheep, goat and cow's milk.

75
00:03:38,009 --> 00:03:40,970
-I can run and get more.
-No, this is plenty of cheese. [chuckles]

76
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:45,016
I have to ask,
has Chidi always been so thoughtful?

77
00:03:45,099 --> 00:03:46,809
Ever since he was a child.

78
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:49,354
I'm sure you've heard about
his first great lecture?

79
00:03:49,437 --> 00:03:52,774
[chuckling] Oh, no, not that old story
again. It's so embarrassing.

80
00:03:52,857 --> 00:03:54,734
-[Ndeye chuckles]
-Oh. Go ahead.

81
00:03:54,817 --> 00:03:58,655
A long time ago, Emeka and I were
going through a rough patch.

82
00:03:58,738 --> 00:04:03,451
And our little Chidi, at eight years old,
comes in with a one-hour lecture.

83
00:04:03,534 --> 00:04:05,787
[Emeka] All about why
we should stay married.

84
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:09,582
And all these years later,
here we still are.

85
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:11,751
-It's the reason I got into philosophy.
-[Allesandra] Hmm.

86
00:04:11,834 --> 00:04:15,046
The biggest questions and the
biggest answers. You just gotta find them.

87
00:04:15,797 --> 00:04:17,632
I mean, I love philosophy, too.

88
00:04:17,715 --> 00:04:18,967
But I'd argue that, say,

89
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:21,803
theoretical physics presents
bigger questions than philosophy.

90
00:04:21,886 --> 00:04:23,388
[Chidi chuckles]

91
00:04:25,765 --> 00:04:26,724
Do you really think that?

92
00:04:27,475 --> 00:04:28,601
Should I switch to physics?

93
00:04:29,894 --> 00:04:34,274
So, obviously, my parents loved you.

94
00:04:34,357 --> 00:04:36,442
I'm so glad. They're great.

95
00:04:37,068 --> 00:04:37,902
We have to break up.

96
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,405
[stutters] Uh...

97
00:04:40,488 --> 00:04:41,656
What? Why?

98
00:04:41,739 --> 00:04:43,658
I've been feeling this way
for a while now.

99
00:04:43,741 --> 00:04:46,327
It's just... why are we together?

100
00:04:46,411 --> 00:04:49,998
[stuttering] Because it makes sense.
I mean, you like Kant, I like Kant...

101
00:04:50,081 --> 00:04:54,168
-We're not a book group.
-Well, we're not... not a book group.

102
00:04:54,752 --> 00:04:57,964
Okay, if there's a problem
with our relationship,

103
00:04:58,047 --> 00:05:00,133
there is an answer that will solve it.

104
00:05:00,216 --> 00:05:01,551
So, let's hit the library.

105
00:05:01,634 --> 00:05:03,761
You wanna use philosophy?
How about David Hume?

106
00:05:03,845 --> 00:05:07,724
"Reason is and ought only to be
a slave to the passions."

107
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:11,394
You know, emotions, desires, feelings.

108
00:05:11,477 --> 00:05:14,856
-Do you have any of those?
-Of course I have feelings.

109
00:05:14,939 --> 00:05:18,651
I have strong feelings for you
and what we have.

110
00:05:19,652 --> 00:05:23,197
And right now, I will show you...

111
00:05:26,951 --> 00:05:30,163
how Kant refuted
most of Hume's central theses.

112
00:05:30,246 --> 00:05:31,414
Oh, my God.

113
00:05:38,504 --> 00:05:41,966
[fork rattling in garbage disposal]

114
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:46,429
-[Chidi] So, what do you think?
-I think it's 3,600 pages.

115
00:05:47,221 --> 00:05:49,015
I have a job, Chidi. I have a family.

116
00:05:49,098 --> 00:05:51,684
Until I had to read this,
I had a will to live.

117
00:05:51,768 --> 00:05:56,939
This work is an insane,
tangled web of inscrutability.

118
00:05:57,023 --> 00:06:01,319
In the fun, "grad students
will analyze this for centuries" way?

119
00:06:01,402 --> 00:06:02,820
No, in the Unabomber way.

120
00:06:03,404 --> 00:06:06,282
Okay. Well, um,
I'll write my way out of the maze.

121
00:06:06,365 --> 00:06:08,242
I'll re-outline the middle chapters,
do more research--

122
00:06:08,326 --> 00:06:09,160
No, Chidi!

123
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:13,206
You can't answer every question
every philosopher has ever asked.

124
00:06:13,289 --> 00:06:16,667
So, what in these pages do you care about?

125
00:06:16,751 --> 00:06:19,545
-All of it. Equally.
-Shut up!

126
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:22,924
-But-- Should I--
-Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!

127
00:06:24,425 --> 00:06:27,845
The greatest works
of moral philosophy are emotional.

128
00:06:27,929 --> 00:06:32,558
They make an argument
about how the world is and ought to be.

129
00:06:32,642 --> 00:06:38,439
There is a great mind at work in here,
but where is the heart?

130
00:06:38,523 --> 00:06:39,857
Where are the guts?

131
00:06:40,942 --> 00:06:43,152
I understand. I do.

132
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:48,199
So, I'm going to go home,
and compose a short paper for you,

133
00:06:48,282 --> 00:06:51,494
arguing that I should continue
working on this longer paper.

134
00:06:51,577 --> 00:06:52,829
[Radja] Shut up!

135
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:59,335
{\an8}Wow. Tough week. Sorry, pal.

136
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:04,590
Honestly, I don't know what hurts more,
my thesis meeting or Allesandra.

137
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:07,885
[sighs] She was brilliant, and funny...

138
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:11,889
I thought that maybe she was the answer.

139
00:07:12,723 --> 00:07:15,143
Some things in life don't have an answer.

140
00:07:15,226 --> 00:07:17,353
Isn't that what Allesandra was saying?

141
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:20,314
[chuckling] Isn't that
what your advisor said, too?

142
00:07:20,398 --> 00:07:22,233
Isn't that what everyone
who knows you has said to you

143
00:07:22,316 --> 00:07:23,776
at every waking moment of your life?

144
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:25,069
Okay, I can figure this out.

145
00:07:25,153 --> 00:07:28,573
I just need to find the answer
for how to impress Allesandra,

146
00:07:28,656 --> 00:07:31,033
a separate answer
for how to impress my advisor

147
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:34,412
or, ideally, one answer
for how to impress them both.

148
00:07:34,495 --> 00:07:36,497
-Oh, you know what this calls for?
-Don't say it.

149
00:07:36,581 --> 00:07:38,833
-A Venn diagram. Yeah.
-No Venn diagram.

150
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:42,837
If you won't listen to other people,
do you at least hear what you're saying?

151
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:45,381
I swear, sometimes it is literally...

152
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:46,507
...impossible to be your friend.

153
00:07:46,591 --> 00:07:48,509
You're incapable
of making a single decision.

154
00:07:48,593 --> 00:07:52,013
Look, what's the harm in taking
a few extra minutes to find the perfect...

155
00:07:58,728 --> 00:08:00,521
Chidi? Come on in.

156
00:08:01,397 --> 00:08:03,441
Unless you'd be more comfortable out here?

157
00:08:03,524 --> 00:08:04,358
Oh.

158
00:08:04,859 --> 00:08:07,570
Well, I feel like you want me to...

159
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:09,947
I'll tell you what, I'll decide for you.
Come on in.

160
00:08:10,031 --> 00:08:10,948
Great.

161
00:08:17,955 --> 00:08:18,789
[Michael] <i>Watch this.</i>

162
00:08:19,957 --> 00:08:21,834
Your fridge chooses
your breakfast for you.

163
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:24,253
Oatmeal and almond milk.

164
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:25,922
Extra filmy.
You don't even have to decide.

165
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:27,548
It just knows what you want.

166
00:08:27,632 --> 00:08:29,717
And for all your other requests...

167
00:08:30,676 --> 00:08:31,511
Janet?

168
00:08:31,594 --> 00:08:32,428
-Hi, there.
-[Chidi yelps]

169
00:08:33,596 --> 00:08:37,517
Janet knows the answers
to all the questions in the universe.

170
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,601
Ask her anything.

171
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:40,353
[chuckles and stutters]

172
00:08:40,436 --> 00:08:41,354
Which answer do I want?

173
00:08:42,063 --> 00:08:45,816
Something profound, obviously.
Shouldn't be trivial or salacious.

174
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:49,237
Or maybe I should start small,
maybe ramp up.

175
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,405
I... or... I can't... [groans]

176
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:54,617
-What's the biggest fish?
-The whale shark.

177
00:08:55,451 --> 00:08:56,536
Cool.

178
00:08:56,619 --> 00:08:58,913
I'm sorry.
I'll have better questions later.

179
00:08:58,996 --> 00:09:03,209
You don't need to apologize, Chidi.
All questions are equally important to me.

180
00:09:03,292 --> 00:09:05,086
Oh, well, then,
you and I are gonna get along great.

181
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:07,171
[Michael chuckles]

182
00:09:07,255 --> 00:09:09,465
I need to go welcome some more residents.

183
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:12,843
Are there any other questions
I can answer for you before I go?

184
00:09:12,927 --> 00:09:17,682
Well, yes. Is there a relationship
equivalent to the oatmeal?

185
00:09:17,765 --> 00:09:18,599
Uh...

186
00:09:18,683 --> 00:09:21,227
-Is there a, sort of...
-Soulmate?

187
00:09:22,353 --> 00:09:23,187
Yes.

188
00:09:23,271 --> 00:09:27,692
Every person in the Good Place
has one perfect match.

189
00:09:27,775 --> 00:09:31,153
In an hour, come on by the little house
that looks like a face,

190
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:34,282
and get the answer
to your ultimate question.

191
00:09:34,907 --> 00:09:36,200
Her name's Eleanor.

192
00:09:45,626 --> 00:09:48,629
Oh, man. Remember this?

193
00:09:48,713 --> 00:09:51,048
Yeah! Yeah, that was eight minutes ago.

194
00:09:51,132 --> 00:09:52,049
[Janet] Mmm-hmm.

195
00:09:52,133 --> 00:09:54,218
So, you just proposed to Janet,

196
00:09:54,302 --> 00:09:56,804
-and you said yes, and now you're married.
-[Jason] Mmm-hmm.

197
00:09:56,887 --> 00:09:57,722
[Janet] Mmm-hmm.

198
00:09:57,805 --> 00:10:01,726
You know, I thought saying that out loud
would make it less insane, but it did not.

199
00:10:01,809 --> 00:10:02,893
Thanks, homie.

200
00:10:02,977 --> 00:10:06,439
If you'd like to get us a present,
we're registered at me. [chuckles]

201
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,151
Jason, I think I need your help.
Can I ask you something?

202
00:10:10,234 --> 00:10:12,403
Whoa. No one's ever
asked me for advice before.

203
00:10:12,486 --> 00:10:13,779
And you're a high school principal.

204
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:15,114
College professor.

205
00:10:15,197 --> 00:10:17,199
Who told you how to do this?

206
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:20,286
How can you
just make a decision this big?

207
00:10:20,911 --> 00:10:23,789
Chidi, here's the thing with stuff.

208
00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:27,335
You can look at a problem from
every angle and drive yourself crazy,

209
00:10:27,418 --> 00:10:30,796
but sometimes you just gotta huck
a Molotov cocktail at a drone

210
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,590
and see what happens.

211
00:10:32,673 --> 00:10:34,383
Is what happens that the drone blows up?

212
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:35,384
Usually.

213
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:37,887
I mean, where I'm from,
most things blow up eventually.

214
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:41,807
So I learned that when something
dope comes along, you gotta lock it down.

215
00:10:41,891 --> 00:10:43,476
If you're always frozen in fear,

216
00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:45,811
and taking too long
to think about what to do,

217
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:47,063
you'll miss your opportunity,

218
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:49,565
and maybe get sucked
into the propeller of a swamp boat.

219
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:54,445
I just don't think I'll ever be
the kind of person who just... acts.

220
00:10:54,528 --> 00:10:58,491
I mean, I can't just open a door
and walk through

221
00:10:58,574 --> 00:11:00,576
without knowing what's on the other side.

222
00:11:01,369 --> 00:11:05,206
Even with eternity to try,
I just don't think that can happen.

223
00:11:05,289 --> 00:11:07,750
Well, I never thought
I'd ever be able to get married.

224
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:09,043
I thought I was too old.

225
00:11:09,627 --> 00:11:14,256
I'm infinity, but strange things
happen in the afterlife. [chuckles]

226
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:21,138
[Eleanor] We figured it out once.
We can do it again.

227
00:11:21,222 --> 00:11:22,932
Because you know what, Michael?

228
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:24,183
-Ya basic--
-[snaps fingers]

229
00:11:24,975 --> 00:11:27,311
[Michael] <i>This is</i>
<i>your soulmate, Salamasina.</i>

230
00:11:27,395 --> 00:11:29,146
<i>Meet your soulmate, Guan-yin.</i>

231
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:30,606
<i>Tahani. Karen.</i>

232
00:11:30,689 --> 00:11:34,068
Esmerelda, you don't bring knives
to a friendly game night.

233
00:11:34,151 --> 00:11:34,985
I mean, who does that?

234
00:11:35,569 --> 00:11:36,445
The prepared.

235
00:11:37,113 --> 00:11:39,907
Chidi, Esmerelda, it's your turn!

236
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:45,454
Blood. Seas of blood.

237
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:46,831
Enemies.

238
00:11:46,914 --> 00:11:47,873
Uh...

239
00:11:47,957 --> 00:11:49,125
A thousand years of darkness.

240
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:52,336
-Uh... Nightmares.
-Blood. Ennui?

241
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:56,674
Lamenting the inexorable passage of time.
Fire and blood. [scoffs]

242
00:11:56,757 --> 00:11:59,510
-[buzzer sounds]
-Ugh! You fool.

243
00:11:59,593 --> 00:12:00,719
{\an8}It was "birthday parties."

244
00:12:00,803 --> 00:12:02,304
"Birthday parties"?

245
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:06,100
These trivialities demean me.
I must away and tend to my ravens.

246
00:12:08,352 --> 00:12:11,439
[chuckling] Well, you never know
what'll happen at game night.

247
00:12:11,522 --> 00:12:13,065
Let's continue.

248
00:12:13,858 --> 00:12:15,943
[softly] I think I can find you
another partner.

249
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:21,824
Tahani, thank you so much.

250
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:25,077
That ended up being one of the best nights
I've had since we got here.

251
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:26,328
You and Eleanor made a good pair.

252
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:28,706
You two really tore through
that round of charades.

253
00:12:28,789 --> 00:12:32,334
Oh, I'm pretty sure she was reading the
cards off the reflection in my glasses,

254
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:34,712
but, yeah, that was amazing.

255
00:12:34,795 --> 00:12:35,796
[both chuckle]

256
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:36,714
Um...

257
00:12:38,174 --> 00:12:40,050
-Can I ask you something?
-Hmm.

258
00:12:40,134 --> 00:12:41,343
Tonight could've been a real disaster.

259
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:44,388
How do you have
the confidence to just swoop in

260
00:12:44,472 --> 00:12:48,809
and so elegantly take charge
of a whole group of strangers?

261
00:12:48,893 --> 00:12:52,438
Honestly, the confidence
comes from failure.

262
00:12:52,521 --> 00:12:56,317
I've thrown my fair share
of disastrous gatherings.

263
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:59,403
Remind me to tell you someday
about Timothée Chalamet's bar mitzvah.

264
00:12:59,987 --> 00:13:03,282
But you live through the failure
and you learn from it.

265
00:13:04,074 --> 00:13:05,951
Yeah, I just can't operate that way.

266
00:13:06,035 --> 00:13:09,580
I can't make a decision
unless I'm sure I'm right.

267
00:13:09,663 --> 00:13:12,416
Hey, Chidi.
You're a philosophy professor, right?

268
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:15,753
Any chance you'd want to grab a drink
and talk about ethics?

269
00:13:15,836 --> 00:13:19,590
It's a subject I've recently
needed to learn about, immediately.

270
00:13:19,673 --> 00:13:22,343
-Sounds great. Uh, let me get my coat.
-[Eleanor] Awesome.

271
00:13:22,426 --> 00:13:26,597
By the way, I wasn't cheating before...
or eavesdropping just now.

272
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:29,517
[Eleanor chuckles] <i>Whoo!</i>

273
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,268
When we started three months ago,

274
00:13:31,352 --> 00:13:35,189
I never thought I'd get so into philosophy
that we'd study past midnight.

275
00:13:35,272 --> 00:13:36,106
[both chuckle]

276
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:38,984
Esmerelda must be wondering
where her soulmate is.

277
00:13:39,068 --> 00:13:40,903
-Ah. She's off in her aviary.
-Oh.

278
00:13:40,986 --> 00:13:43,030
Sometimes, I think her ravens
are her real soulmate.

279
00:13:43,113 --> 00:13:44,114
[both chuckle]

280
00:13:44,198 --> 00:13:45,741
I'm not kidding, actually.

281
00:13:45,824 --> 00:13:47,451
You should see her with them.
It's intense.

282
00:13:47,535 --> 00:13:49,578
And if I'm being honest, sexually charged.

283
00:13:50,162 --> 00:13:53,791
Anyways. Um...
This has been fun as always--

284
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:57,211
[sighs] Uh...

285
00:13:58,045 --> 00:14:00,714
What was... Why did you...

286
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:02,174
Who was it?

287
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:03,342
[chuckles]

288
00:14:03,425 --> 00:14:06,845
Okay, I'll take those one at a time,
I guess. Um...

289
00:14:07,805 --> 00:14:08,764
It was a kiss.

290
00:14:09,932 --> 00:14:12,101
I did it because I wanted to.

291
00:14:12,184 --> 00:14:15,437
And as far as who it was,
it was me, weirdo.

292
00:14:16,021 --> 00:14:18,232
Eleanor, I have a soulmate.

293
00:14:18,315 --> 00:14:21,110
Yeah, and you're not into her at all.

294
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:25,614
I mean, come on. There is no way
you're supposed to spend eternity

295
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:27,741
with a woman who sleeps in a giant nest.

296
00:14:27,825 --> 00:14:31,287
I know she and I are in a rough patch,

297
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:34,039
but we just have to find the answer
for how to get out of it.

298
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:35,082
Like my parents.

299
00:14:35,165 --> 00:14:36,667
You remember that story
I told you about my parents?

300
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:39,920
Yeah, I don't think that story is
as cute as you think it is, man.

301
00:14:40,629 --> 00:14:47,011
I mean, I'm sure you were cute, you know,
big melon head and a little necktie.

302
00:14:47,094 --> 00:14:51,223
But that moment? Woof, that's too much
to put on an eight-year-old.

303
00:14:51,974 --> 00:14:55,060
I kinda wish
cute little Chidi just got to be a kid,

304
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:58,939
rather than a miniature professor
trying to solve all the world's problems.

305
00:14:59,023 --> 00:15:03,694
Well, but...
living that way led me to philosophy.

306
00:15:03,777 --> 00:15:06,906
And, sure, I was written up
in a medical journal

307
00:15:06,989 --> 00:15:09,408
as the youngest person ever
with a stress-induced ulcer,

308
00:15:09,491 --> 00:15:11,243
but I got into the Good Place.

309
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:12,786
So, if you don't mind,

310
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:18,125
I'm gonna take a second to think about
what I owe my universe-approved soulmate,

311
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:22,254
and not just, uh, make out with you.

312
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:25,591
Okay, man. Kiss rescinded.

313
00:15:25,674 --> 00:15:31,055
We'll just study, like two platonic nerds,
until Michael discovers me,

314
00:15:31,138 --> 00:15:34,808
or until Esmerelda turns me into a toad
with her magic amulet,

315
00:15:34,892 --> 00:15:38,646
because she can see
that we're obviously into each other.

316
00:15:39,396 --> 00:15:43,734
Oh. Sorry you got an actual human being
instead of your true soulmate...

317
00:15:43,817 --> 00:15:46,487
-a library cart full of damp saltines.
-[chuckles]

318
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:47,905
You are unbelievable.

319
00:15:47,988 --> 00:15:50,157
I don't know what I did...

320
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,825
-...to deserve you.
-[chuckles]

321
00:15:51,909 --> 00:15:54,870
Believe it, baby. I'm all yours.

322
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:57,122
At least until
something better comes along.

323
00:15:57,748 --> 00:16:00,626
For me. You've pretty much topped out.

324
00:16:01,335 --> 00:16:02,586
-[Eleanor] You okay?
-No!

325
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:05,839
I have to give Michael a new draft
of my thesis and I'm a mess. [chuckles]

326
00:16:05,923 --> 00:16:06,882
Will you help me?

327
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:11,136
Woof! You want my help with philosophy?
You must be in rough shape. [chuckles]

328
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:13,013
-I mean, yes, of course.
-[sighs]

329
00:16:13,097 --> 00:16:15,140
I'm here for you. What do you need?

330
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:19,687
I need someone to help guide me,
morally speaking.

331
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:23,107
And I think I need it to be you.

332
00:16:24,108 --> 00:16:26,986
There's a real possibility
that I'm in love with you again,

333
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:31,907
here, on this plane of existence,
uh, today, now.

334
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:37,329
[Eleanor] <i>We found each other before,</i>
<i>hundreds of times.</i>

335
00:16:37,955 --> 00:16:39,164
We can do it again.

336
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:46,338
Bye, Chidi.

337
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:50,884
[Michael] <i>You sure you want to do this?</i>

338
00:16:50,968 --> 00:16:53,220
I finally make up my mind
about one damn thing

339
00:16:53,303 --> 00:16:54,388
and you try to talk me out of it?

340
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:57,641
I'm sure.

341
00:16:59,476 --> 00:17:00,644
Can I ask you a question?

342
00:17:02,104 --> 00:17:06,191
Soulmates aren't real, are they?

343
00:17:06,942 --> 00:17:10,195
Chidi, in all honesty, I don't know.
But I don't think so.

344
00:17:11,321 --> 00:17:15,451
I knew what you expected to find
when you got here: answers.

345
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:20,039
Also, if I recall from your file,
a magic blackboard?

346
00:17:20,122 --> 00:17:22,958
One that anticipates your lesson flow.
That is the dream.

347
00:17:24,084 --> 00:17:25,753
But mostly you wanted answers.

348
00:17:25,836 --> 00:17:27,046
[inhales and exhales deeply]

349
00:17:27,129 --> 00:17:29,506
The "soulmate" one in particular.

350
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:33,135
So, I used it to torture you.

351
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:35,637
Which, again, sorry.

352
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:42,269
If soulmates do exist,
they're not found, they're made.

353
00:17:42,352 --> 00:17:45,189
People meet, they get a good feeling

354
00:17:45,272 --> 00:17:47,983
and then they get to work,
building a relationship.

355
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:49,735
Like your parents.

356
00:17:50,778 --> 00:17:55,074
They didn't magically stay together
because you proved they should.

357
00:17:57,451 --> 00:18:00,621
It wasn't my logic or my presentation.

358
00:18:00,704 --> 00:18:04,750
It was the feeling they got watching me,

359
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:09,838
[chuckles] this scared little kid,
telling them that he needed them.

360
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:11,799
And it was also
what you made them remember.

361
00:18:11,882 --> 00:18:13,217
They loved each other.

362
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:15,260
Sometimes, people forget.

363
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:17,846
You reminded them
of what they already had.

364
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:20,224
It convinced them to go to counseling.

365
00:18:20,808 --> 00:18:21,934
I never knew they went to counseling.

366
00:18:22,017 --> 00:18:23,477
[chuckles] Yeah, kids are idiots.

367
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:26,980
If they knew half the stuff their folks
were up to, they'd lose their minds.

368
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:28,607
[Chidi sighs]

369
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:35,364
Turns out, life isn't a puzzle that can
just be solved one time and it's done.

370
00:18:36,073 --> 00:18:40,410
You wake up every day
and you solve it again.

371
00:18:41,203 --> 00:18:42,621
Terribly inefficient.

372
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:48,085
[chuckling] Ah, what a time to learn.

373
00:18:52,047 --> 00:18:53,090
Can you give me a second?

374
00:19:04,726 --> 00:19:06,395
-Janet?
-Hi, there.

375
00:19:06,478 --> 00:19:07,354
Hi.

376
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,774
Uh, can I have a pen and some paper?

377
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:22,452
I don't know if I'll see you again,
or what I'll remember if I do,

378
00:19:22,536 --> 00:19:28,041
but if we do cross paths again,
sometime, somewhere...

379
00:19:30,544 --> 00:19:31,795
can you get this back to me?

380
00:19:32,379 --> 00:19:33,213
Of course.

381
00:19:38,594 --> 00:19:39,428
[sighs]

382
00:19:43,223 --> 00:19:44,141
I'm ready.

383
00:19:51,231 --> 00:19:52,107
[drink splatters]

384
00:19:53,817 --> 00:19:54,985
Hi, there, Chidi.

385
00:19:57,237 --> 00:19:58,322
Welcome back.

386
00:19:58,906 --> 00:20:01,200
Is he all right? Did you break him?

387
00:20:01,783 --> 00:20:04,286
[Michael] Hey, buddy. How you doing?

388
00:20:05,621 --> 00:20:07,706
{\an8}Man, I'm doin' great. [sighs]

389
00:20:08,457 --> 00:20:14,129
{\an8}Hey, so, for the past 300 years,
have I been super annoying?

390
00:20:14,838 --> 00:20:15,672
{\an8}Oh, no...

391
00:20:15,756 --> 00:20:17,883
{\an8}-[Michael] No, I wouldn't say... No, no.
-[Tahani] Well, not extremely...

392
00:20:17,966 --> 00:20:19,426
{\an8}-[Jason] Yes.
-[Chidi] Well, thank you,

393
00:20:19,509 --> 00:20:22,221
{\an8}all of you,
for everything you've done for me.

394
00:20:22,304 --> 00:20:24,014
{\an8}You are wonderful people.

395
00:20:24,097 --> 00:20:28,101
{\an8}Yeah, man, that's great, but, um, listen,
we have one hour to create

396
00:20:28,185 --> 00:20:31,772
{\an8}an entirely new afterlife
and, uh, also save all of humanity,

397
00:20:31,855 --> 00:20:37,152
{\an8}and we were wondering if you could do
your Chidi thing and find us the answer?

398
00:20:37,861 --> 00:20:41,406
Oh, well, Eleanor, this kind of thing
doesn't have just one answer.

399
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:43,533
There might be 800.

400
00:20:43,617 --> 00:20:45,744
There could be zero. Who knows?

401
00:20:45,827 --> 00:20:48,413
The journey is the destination, right?

402
00:20:48,497 --> 00:20:50,165
Let's get to work.
Can you give me one second?

403
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:51,333
[stutters]

404
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:54,253
Hey, uh, Janet?
Can I have my note, please?

405
00:20:55,337 --> 00:20:58,632
If you know that you wrote a note
then you know what it says.

406
00:20:58,715 --> 00:21:03,679
I do, uh, but I'd still
like to see it again, please.

407
00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:06,098
I think it might be
some of the best writing I've ever done.
