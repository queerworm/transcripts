1
00:00:04,546 --> 00:00:05,880
[door opens]

2
00:00:07,549 --> 00:00:09,509
Eleanor, come on in.

3
00:00:10,844 --> 00:00:14,931
Well, not often you get to confront
your greatest failure face-to-face.

4
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:16,558
Good to see you, too, bud.

5
00:00:16,641 --> 00:00:19,102
I am just dumbfounded
as to how this happened.

6
00:00:19,185 --> 00:00:22,230
Our system has never
made a mistake before...

7
00:00:22,313 --> 00:00:23,481
It's just not possible.

8
00:00:23,565 --> 00:00:25,817
And yet, here we are.

9
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:27,444
First things first...

10
00:00:28,987 --> 00:00:30,238
Who are you?

11
00:00:30,321 --> 00:00:34,075
Well, my name is Eleanor Shellstrop,
and some of the info you had was right.

12
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:37,412
I mean, "flattened by boner pill truck

13
00:00:37,495 --> 00:00:40,331
after dropping margarita mix
in grocery store parking lot,"

14
00:00:40,415 --> 00:00:41,875
that's a very me way to die.

15
00:00:41,958 --> 00:00:44,794
But all the other info was wrong.

16
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:47,839
In my defense, when I first arrived,
and you said,

17
00:00:47,922 --> 00:00:50,759
"You, Eleanor Shellstrop, are dead,
and you're in The Good Place."

18
00:00:50,842 --> 00:00:53,678
I had no reason to think
that was a mistake.

19
00:00:53,762 --> 00:00:55,513
Location and date of birth, please.

20
00:00:55,889 --> 00:00:59,142
Phoenix, Arizona, October 14th, 1986.

21
00:00:59,726 --> 00:01:00,727
So sorry.

22
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:03,772
That's what I used to tell people
when I lied about my age.

23
00:01:03,855 --> 00:01:06,608
I was born in 1982.

24
00:01:06,691 --> 00:01:09,778
You lied so much,
you forgot your own birthday.

25
00:01:10,028 --> 00:01:11,154
Not a great start,

26
00:01:11,237 --> 00:01:14,657
but it should be enough
for Janet to locate your file.

27
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:16,159
-Janet?
-[tone chimes]

28
00:01:17,535 --> 00:01:19,454
-Janet...
-What's that?

29
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:21,039
What's that?

30
00:01:21,122 --> 00:01:22,582
[gasps] What's this?

31
00:01:24,042 --> 00:01:25,460
Her memory's still being rebooted

32
00:01:25,543 --> 00:01:28,296
because, oh, you know,
someone murdered her.

33
00:01:29,005 --> 00:01:33,218
Janet, could you please locate the file
for an Eleanor Shellstrop, born in...

34
00:01:33,635 --> 00:01:35,595
-1982?
-Yes.

35
00:01:35,678 --> 00:01:37,555
Phoenix, Arizona, USA.

36
00:01:37,639 --> 00:01:39,057
-Sure.
-[tone chimes]

37
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:40,725
Anything else?

38
00:01:40,809 --> 00:01:43,102
No, Janet, this is actually a cactus.

39
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:47,023
This might take a while.

40
00:01:47,106 --> 00:01:48,316
[Janet] Whee!

41
00:01:55,448 --> 00:01:58,243
[sighs] Since Janet
can't retrieve your file,

42
00:01:58,326 --> 00:01:59,702
I need to find another way

43
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:01,955
to determine what kind of person you were.

44
00:02:02,664 --> 00:02:05,041
{\an8}This is a quick litmus test.

45
00:02:05,542 --> 00:02:07,710
{\an8}Handful of questions designed to tell

46
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:10,046
{\an8}whether you were fundamentally
good or bad.

47
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:11,256
{\an8}Question number one.

48
00:02:11,339 --> 00:02:13,466
{\an8}Did you ever commit a serious crime,

49
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:17,929
{\an8}such as murder, sexual harassment,
arson, or otherwise?

50
00:02:18,012 --> 00:02:19,097
{\an8}No.

51
00:02:20,932 --> 00:02:22,892
{\an8}Did you ever have
a vanity license plate,

52
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:27,147
{\an8}like "Mama's BMW"
"Lexus for Liz" or "Boob guy"?

53
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:28,106
{\an8}No.

54
00:02:28,273 --> 00:02:30,650
{\an8}Did you ever reheat fish
in an office microwave?

55
00:02:30,733 --> 00:02:31,734
{\an8}Ew, no.

56
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:34,821
{\an8}Have you ever paid money to hear
music performed by California

57
00:02:34,904 --> 00:02:37,198
{\an8}funk rock band
The Red Hot Chili Peppers?

58
00:02:37,282 --> 00:02:38,116
{\an8}No.

59
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:42,579
{\an8}Did you ever take off your shoes
and socks on a commercial airline?

60
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:45,623
{\an8}And socks?
Ew, who would do that?

61
00:02:46,332 --> 00:02:49,919
{\an8}People who go to The Bad Place,
Eleanor, that's the point.

62
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:53,298
{\an8}And unless I can figure out
a compelling reason to keep you here,

63
00:02:53,381 --> 00:02:57,677
{\an8}you will spend eternity with murderers,
and arsonists,

64
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:02,181
{\an8}and people who take off their shoes
and socks on commercial airlines.

65
00:03:03,057 --> 00:03:06,019
{\an8}[clears throat] Janet, can I have
a glass of water, please?

66
00:03:06,102 --> 00:03:07,645
{\an8}-[tone chimes]
-Here you go.

67
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:11,107
{\an8}Oh, gosh.
[chuckles] You said, "Water?"

68
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:12,817
{\an8}-Yeah.
-I'm so sorry.

69
00:03:12,901 --> 00:03:14,777
{\an8}-[tone chimes]
-There you go.

70
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:16,029
{\an8}Ah...

71
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:22,118
{\an8}I really do have sympathy
for your situation.

72
00:03:22,201 --> 00:03:24,621
I mean, you thought your soul mate
was a good person,

73
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:27,123
and then you learned that
she's just an immoral grifter.

74
00:03:27,206 --> 00:03:28,958
-Tahani, please.
-Am I wrong?

75
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:31,002
She lied to everyone.

76
00:03:31,085 --> 00:03:34,172
She caused a giant sinkhole
into which poor Glenn fell.

77
00:03:34,255 --> 00:03:35,757
She caused a trash storm.

78
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:40,762
She... Well, she pretended to be my friend
when I really needed one.

79
00:03:40,845 --> 00:03:44,015
And, lest we forget, she murdered Janet.

80
00:03:44,098 --> 00:03:45,475
As far as I'm concerned,

81
00:03:45,558 --> 00:03:48,102
the sooner she's gone,
the better off we'll all be.

82
00:03:48,186 --> 00:03:50,271
I understand that Eleanor
violated our trust,

83
00:03:50,355 --> 00:03:52,857
but please, when you're talking
to Michael,

84
00:03:52,941 --> 00:03:55,485
try to think about what she's
had to go through.

85
00:03:57,070 --> 00:04:00,490
All right. I will, for you.

86
00:04:01,366 --> 00:04:02,992
But we've been through a lot as well.

87
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:04,869
You know, I haven't been this
upset since my good friend

88
00:04:04,953 --> 00:04:06,913
Taylor was rudely upstaged
by my other friend, Kanye,

89
00:04:06,996 --> 00:04:09,415
who was defending
my best friend, Beyonce.

90
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:12,961
And finally, a multi-part question.

91
00:04:13,044 --> 00:04:15,713
Did you ever appear on the American
television program

92
00:04:15,797 --> 00:04:20,843
<i>The Bachelor</i> or its companion shows,
<i>The Bachelorette</i> and <i>Bachelor in Paradise,</i>

93
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:26,641
or post on any social media site
that you were emotionally invested

94
00:04:26,724 --> 00:04:30,520
in any of the relationships
the contestants were pursuing?

95
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:31,854
No.

96
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:32,981
Okay.

97
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:37,860
You did very well on the questionnaire,
Eleanor. So far, so good.

98
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:39,821
-[tone chimes]
-Michael, good news.

99
00:04:39,904 --> 00:04:42,490
I was able to obtain
Eleanor Shellstrop's file.

100
00:04:42,657 --> 00:04:44,742
[sighs] Is it actually a cactus?

101
00:04:44,867 --> 00:04:45,952
I don't understand.

102
00:04:46,035 --> 00:04:48,705
I want to see the file
for Eleanor Shellstrop.

103
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:51,708
Is that what you have,
or do you have a cactus?

104
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:53,042
-I have the file.
-You're sure?

105
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:55,044
You have the file and not a cactus?

106
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:57,922
That is correct.
I have Eleanor Shellstrop's file.

107
00:04:58,006 --> 00:04:59,424
I do not have a cactus.

108
00:04:59,882 --> 00:05:01,884
Excellent! Please, give me the file.

109
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:03,052
-Here you go.
-[tone chimes]

110
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:05,096
Thank you, Janet.

111
00:05:05,179 --> 00:05:06,472
-You're welcome.
-[tone chimes]

112
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:09,600
Well, I say we call it a day.

113
00:05:09,684 --> 00:05:13,354
I mean, I nailed the questionnaire,
and you're swimming in cacti.

114
00:05:13,438 --> 00:05:18,026
Can't we just chalk this up to a hilarious
mistake and move on?

115
00:05:18,109 --> 00:05:19,736
No, we can't, Eleanor.

116
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:23,072
There's no such thing
as a mistake in this realm.

117
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:25,450
And yet, you are, somehow, a mistake.

118
00:05:25,533 --> 00:05:30,538
I mean, you're a giant chunk of spinach
in the teeth of the universe.

119
00:05:36,961 --> 00:05:40,298
I need to understand every facet
of this disaster.

120
00:05:40,882 --> 00:05:42,383
Tell me a lie about yourself.

121
00:05:42,467 --> 00:05:43,801
Any lie.

122
00:05:43,885 --> 00:05:46,095
I love the opera.

123
00:05:47,346 --> 00:05:48,514
And now a truth.

124
00:05:48,598 --> 00:05:50,349
I love Women's MMA.

125
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:53,102
We don't like to use this.

126
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:56,856
We've never really had a call for it
before you, but in the interest of time.

127
00:05:56,939 --> 00:06:00,651
Eleanor, did you murder Janet?

128
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:02,737
No, I did not.

129
00:06:04,655 --> 00:06:06,032
Do you know who did?

130
00:06:06,115 --> 00:06:07,200
Yes.

131
00:06:08,242 --> 00:06:09,535
Will you tell me who it was?

132
00:06:10,369 --> 00:06:11,370
No.

133
00:06:12,705 --> 00:06:14,332
I assume it was one of your friends,

134
00:06:14,415 --> 00:06:17,335
and I admire you
for protecting him or her.

135
00:06:17,627 --> 00:06:19,504
But, Eleanor, in The Good Place,

136
00:06:19,587 --> 00:06:23,424
there's no room for bad people
or bad actions.

137
00:06:23,508 --> 00:06:25,593
So anyone involved
in the murder of Janet

138
00:06:25,676 --> 00:06:27,929
will be reviewed and judged,

139
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:30,640
and there will be consequences.

140
00:06:33,601 --> 00:06:35,269
Tahani, come on in.

141
00:06:35,353 --> 00:06:36,521
Chidi.

142
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:41,192
Impostor who soiled our paradise
with her moral turpitude.

143
00:06:41,275 --> 00:06:42,401
'Sup?

144
00:06:42,485 --> 00:06:45,738
Thank you for confessing, I don't know
what I would have done if you hadn't--

145
00:06:45,822 --> 00:06:47,365
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm amazing.
Bad news.

146
00:06:47,448 --> 00:06:49,951
Michael knows I didn't kill Janet,

147
00:06:50,034 --> 00:06:53,454
which means it's only a matter of time
before he finds out that you did

148
00:06:53,538 --> 00:06:57,250
and that you did it because you were
trying to stop Bonehead Jones over here.

149
00:06:57,333 --> 00:06:58,334
Hey, homies!

150
00:06:58,417 --> 00:07:03,339
Then he'll figure out that Jianyu's also
a phony, and, here's the real dong-buster,

151
00:07:03,422 --> 00:07:08,010
Michael said anybody who did anything bad
might have to go...

152
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:08,970
Oh...

153
00:07:09,053 --> 00:07:11,305
Which means Jianyu's gone,
you might be gone,

154
00:07:11,389 --> 00:07:13,641
and all three of us are royally
forking forked!

155
00:07:13,724 --> 00:07:16,018
This is terrible.
What am I supposed to do if he asks me?

156
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:21,065
I don't know. Kant would say that lying
in any scenario is wrong,

157
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:24,902
so if Michael asks you if you killed
Janet, you should say yes.

158
00:07:24,986 --> 00:07:28,322
On the other hand,
snitches do get stitches.

159
00:07:28,406 --> 00:07:32,076
That is true. I read that once
on the back of my boy Peanut's tricep.

160
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,245
You just casually cited Immanuel Kant.

161
00:07:34,328 --> 00:07:36,330
Yeah, I know we're
in a miserable bind here,

162
00:07:36,414 --> 00:07:38,833
but this might be the proudest
day of my life.

163
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:41,461
No offense, but that's
a real bummer of a life.

164
00:07:43,087 --> 00:07:46,132
Tahani, I'll get right
to the crux of the matter.

165
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:47,592
Did you murder Janet?

166
00:07:47,675 --> 00:07:49,010
Absolutely not.

167
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:54,098
Now, you spent a lot
of time with Eleanor.

168
00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:55,349
Why do you think that is?

169
00:07:55,433 --> 00:07:57,602
Well, people are just drawn to me.

170
00:07:57,685 --> 00:07:59,812
You know, one of my shyest friends,
I won't say his name,

171
00:07:59,896 --> 00:08:03,107
to preserve his privacy,
but he found my presence so comforting

172
00:08:03,191 --> 00:08:06,235
that he asked me to co-host his TV show
<i>Anderson Cooper 360.</i>

173
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:11,824
Given what you learned about Eleanor,
do you think she deserves to be here?

174
00:08:14,118 --> 00:08:15,119
Well...

175
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:20,500
You know, if it were up to me,
I might find a way to look past her, um...

176
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:23,085
Deficiencies.

177
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:24,378
But it's not up to me, is it?

178
00:08:24,462 --> 00:08:26,797
There are some criteria
that she unfortunately

179
00:08:26,881 --> 00:08:28,591
just didn't meet in her time on Earth.

180
00:08:28,674 --> 00:08:30,676
So you think that I should
send her to The Bad Place?

181
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,386
Well, I didn't say that,

182
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:36,516
but is her staying here unfair
to those who earned their place?

183
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:38,684
It sounds like you want her to leave.

184
00:08:38,768 --> 00:08:44,607
Well, is it not she who wants
us to leave her?

185
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:47,527
Thank you, Tahani.
You've been a big help.

186
00:08:50,071 --> 00:08:51,405
Listen up, genius.

187
00:08:51,489 --> 00:08:52,740
He's gonna call you in there in a second.

188
00:08:52,823 --> 00:08:54,825
Don't worry, I got you.
I'll just tell Michael

189
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:57,370
you're the bomb and that you got
a dope soul and hella ethics.

190
00:08:57,453 --> 00:09:00,164
Oh, boy.
No, don't say any of that.

191
00:09:00,248 --> 00:09:03,417
Michael has a lie detector in there.
It's a glowing cube.

192
00:09:03,501 --> 00:09:05,962
Like the AllSpark?
From <i>Transformers?</i>

193
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:08,714
Sure, just like the
AllSpark from <i>Transformers,</i>

194
00:09:08,798 --> 00:09:11,425
and he'll know instantly
if you're lying about anything

195
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:14,720
so only smiles and nods, got it?

196
00:09:16,264 --> 00:09:20,476
Wise, sage, centered Jianyu.

197
00:09:21,936 --> 00:09:25,106
I seek your wisdom
in this moment of crisis.

198
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:27,567
What to do with Eleanor?

199
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:31,571
Should I let her stay?
Should I send her away?

200
00:09:32,905 --> 00:09:35,658
You think I should send her away?

201
00:09:36,534 --> 00:09:39,328
No, I should let her stay?

202
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:44,250
Or no, I shouldn't let her stay
because she doesn't belong here?

203
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:47,753
Or no, I shouldn't let her stay
even though she does belong here?

204
00:09:48,963 --> 00:09:52,717
Oh, Jianyu, I wish I had your wisdom.

205
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,303
Your devotion to the noble truths
has given you something

206
00:09:55,386 --> 00:09:57,805
that I don't have, clarity.

207
00:09:58,306 --> 00:10:00,474
It was Buddha who said,

208
00:10:00,558 --> 00:10:03,185
"If a man lives a pure life.

209
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:04,729
"Nothing can destroy him."

210
00:10:05,146 --> 00:10:08,941
I'm not a man, and I've lived no life,

211
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:10,985
so will this destroy me?

212
00:10:11,068 --> 00:10:12,194
Ouch!

213
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:17,575
Oh, of course.

214
00:10:18,367 --> 00:10:21,829
A cactus on its own intends no harm.

215
00:10:21,912 --> 00:10:24,957
It's only when we interfere
that it becomes dangerous.

216
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:30,755
I need to remember my own agency here.
Oh, thank you, Jianyu.

217
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:32,882
You're free to go.

218
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:38,763
Oh, yes, of course. Help yourself.
I've got plenty of those.

219
00:10:42,683 --> 00:10:43,893
Chidi, come on in.

220
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:46,520
-[tone chimes]
-Hi, there. I have Eleanor's file.

221
00:10:46,604 --> 00:10:48,814
Janet, if you hand me a cactus,

222
00:10:48,898 --> 00:10:50,524
-I swear I will lose my mind.
-[tone chimes]

223
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,569
Oh, yes!

224
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:55,655
All right, here we go.
Eleanor, come back in.

225
00:10:55,738 --> 00:10:57,281
Chidi, you stay here.

226
00:10:57,365 --> 00:10:58,449
[sighs]

227
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:02,620
This file contains a compendium

228
00:11:02,703 --> 00:11:05,873
of all of the highest impact events
from your life.

229
00:11:05,956 --> 00:11:08,918
That's the biggest positive
and negative point swings.

230
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:11,629
So "Little Julie," who's that?

231
00:11:11,712 --> 00:11:13,172
Julie is my cousin's daughter.

232
00:11:13,255 --> 00:11:16,425
Her mom is kind of a mess,
so I used to take her

233
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:19,261
to the mall sometimes
and bought her churro dogs.

234
00:11:20,137 --> 00:11:23,432
It's a hot dog,
but the bun is two churros.

235
00:11:23,849 --> 00:11:26,727
And it's tied together with a Slim Jim.

236
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:28,479
It's an Arizona delicacy.

237
00:11:28,562 --> 00:11:32,441
Oh, sounds awful, but it's very nice
that you made that girl happy.

238
00:11:33,567 --> 00:11:36,070
So what's this "Kool Threadz,

239
00:11:36,153 --> 00:11:39,407
"Glendale, Arizona's
Premiere T-Shirt Emporium"?

240
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:42,410
Uh... Can we skip around and circle back?

241
00:11:42,493 --> 00:11:44,495
How about I tell you more
about those churro dogs?

242
00:11:44,578 --> 00:11:46,414
They came with unlimited ranch dressing.

243
00:11:46,497 --> 00:11:48,416
Let's hear about the t-shirts, please.

244
00:11:48,499 --> 00:11:50,251
[squeals] Okay.

245
00:11:50,584 --> 00:11:54,004
I'll tell you,
but it doesn't make me look great,

246
00:11:54,922 --> 00:11:56,090
so don't judge me.

247
00:11:56,173 --> 00:12:00,052
That's literally the purpose
of this entire exercise.

248
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:05,182
Okay, to understand this,

249
00:12:05,266 --> 00:12:07,893
you have to know
about my roommate, Madison.

250
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:09,645
<i>She was terrible.</i>

251
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:11,272
[Eleanor] Hey, Mads.

252
00:12:11,355 --> 00:12:13,357
Um, I have to go to this
stupid work party tonight.

253
00:12:13,441 --> 00:12:15,025
Can I borrow your peach dress?

254
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:17,820
Ooh, that's a hard no, babe.

255
00:12:17,903 --> 00:12:19,280
That dress is like twice your salary.

256
00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:22,366
All right, I gotta go to the DMV
and pick up my vanity plates.

257
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:23,742
<i>Ciao,</i> bitches.

258
00:12:32,543 --> 00:12:33,711
[sighs]

259
00:12:37,173 --> 00:12:38,299
[dress rips]

260
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:47,683
[sighs] Well, that's not great,

261
00:12:47,766 --> 00:12:50,394
but I assume you confessed
and paid to fix it.

262
00:12:50,478 --> 00:12:51,562
Not exactly.

263
00:12:51,645 --> 00:12:55,149
Hey, losers, I'm going out.
Can you zip me?

264
00:12:55,232 --> 00:12:57,318
Dude, that dress is hella ripped.

265
00:12:57,401 --> 00:12:59,403
-What?
-[laughing]

266
00:12:59,487 --> 00:13:01,822
Oh, that stupid dry cleaner!

267
00:13:01,906 --> 00:13:04,950
Well, that's the risk you take
when you keep your clothes clean.

268
00:13:05,034 --> 00:13:07,912
My mom's a lawyer.
Those asswipes are gonna pay.

269
00:13:08,245 --> 00:13:13,584
She sued for $900 for the dress
and $80,000,000 in emotional distress.

270
00:13:13,709 --> 00:13:16,086
The legal fees drove the dry cleaner
out of business.

271
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:17,296
Oh, boy.

272
00:13:18,255 --> 00:13:21,717
Wait, this story's about t-shirts.

273
00:13:22,384 --> 00:13:23,719
There's more, isn't there?

274
00:13:24,595 --> 00:13:25,513
A little.

275
00:13:25,596 --> 00:13:27,097
Check this out.

276
00:13:27,264 --> 00:13:30,434
Somebody put the dry cleaners'
story online, and it went viral.

277
00:13:30,518 --> 00:13:31,977
Madison's famous.

278
00:13:32,728 --> 00:13:34,772
The "Dress Bitch"? Yikes.

279
00:13:34,855 --> 00:13:36,106
[snickers] Serves her right.

280
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:38,776
Madison is psycho.
She totally overreacted.

281
00:13:38,859 --> 00:13:39,777
This is her fault.

282
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:42,696
Yeah, her fault. That works.

283
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:43,739
[door opens]

284
00:13:43,822 --> 00:13:46,784
You guys, what is happening?

285
00:13:46,867 --> 00:13:48,452
Someone egged my Lexus,

286
00:13:48,536 --> 00:13:51,705
and I have like 40,000 tweets
calling me the "Dress Bitch"?

287
00:13:51,789 --> 00:13:54,124
Over a loser dry cleaner man?

288
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:59,838
Why is everyone so jealous of me?
This is a trash city, full of idiots.

289
00:14:01,465 --> 00:14:02,716
-[laughing]
-[door closes]

290
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:05,261
-The "Dress Bitch" is so catchy.
-Yeah.

291
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:07,304
I mean, someone could
totally make t-shirts.

292
00:14:07,388 --> 00:14:09,473
[gasps] Oh...

293
00:14:09,557 --> 00:14:11,809
No, no. No. No.

294
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:15,312
Do not tell me that you made
t-shirts that said...

295
00:14:15,396 --> 00:14:17,856
That and then sold them for a profit?

296
00:14:18,107 --> 00:14:21,652
Wish I could tell you that, bud.
[sighs] I really do.

297
00:14:21,735 --> 00:14:24,738
Girl, check it out!
They're here.

298
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:30,286
Wait a second. Is this insane?
I mean, should we be doing this?

299
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:32,454
Dude, Madison brought
this on herself, okay?

300
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:35,833
She's a nightmare of a person
to everybody.

301
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:38,085
Plus, we already have
a ton of pre-orders.

302
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:40,671
Here is your first cut of the profits.

303
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:42,381
Holy mama!

304
00:14:43,966 --> 00:14:45,926
I can't believe you sold the t-shirts.

305
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:48,721
Does it help if they basically
sold themselves?

306
00:14:48,804 --> 00:14:50,472
I think you know it does not.

307
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:52,933
What did you do with the money?

308
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:55,728
Yeah. [sighs] I was hoping
you wouldn't ask me that.

309
00:14:58,522 --> 00:14:59,607
[beeping]

310
00:15:00,691 --> 00:15:02,192
Thanks, babe.

311
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:07,531
Next question.

312
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:09,700
Eleanor.

313
00:15:11,035 --> 00:15:15,039
Given what you know about the people
who've been brought here,

314
00:15:15,122 --> 00:15:17,207
the lives they've led,

315
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:19,835
do you think you belong in The Good Place?

316
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:23,255
No, I don't.

317
00:15:32,097 --> 00:15:34,016
[Trevor] <i>Yello, Bad Place.</i>
<i>What's up, dummy?</i>

318
00:15:35,017 --> 00:15:40,397
This is Michael, the architect from
Good Place Neighborhood 12358W.

319
00:15:40,731 --> 00:15:45,194
I'm guessing you've been looking
for someone called Eleanor Shellstrop.

320
00:15:46,487 --> 00:15:48,530
She's here. Come and get her.

321
00:15:52,534 --> 00:15:54,119
[train whistling]

322
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:00,000
[woman grunts]

323
00:16:00,876 --> 00:16:02,628
[Alexis] What is this?

324
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:05,255
What is that smell? Ew.

325
00:16:07,758 --> 00:16:09,343
[Good Place woman] Get out of here!

326
00:16:14,181 --> 00:16:15,182
Hello, Trevor.

327
00:16:15,599 --> 00:16:17,851
Hey, there he is.
Good to see you again, Mikey.

328
00:16:17,935 --> 00:16:19,728
Hey, think fast,
I brought you something.

329
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:22,314
Oh, nuts, thank you. Oh!

330
00:16:24,024 --> 00:16:25,484
[laughing]

331
00:16:25,567 --> 00:16:28,487
Oh, flaming snake ate
all the nuts you brought me.

332
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:30,698
Argh. You're too nice to humiliate.

333
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:32,908
Oh, hello.

334
00:16:33,575 --> 00:16:36,704
Hi, you look like a piece of crap,
are, are you Eleanor?

335
00:16:37,621 --> 00:16:40,332
Dude, you're like
a legend in The Bad Place.

336
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:41,500
You're... Check this out.

337
00:16:42,626 --> 00:16:44,378
-Huh?
-[all] "Dress Bitch"!

338
00:16:44,461 --> 00:16:45,546
It's pretty great, right?

339
00:16:45,629 --> 00:16:46,672
Trevor...

340
00:16:46,755 --> 00:16:49,633
Do you know what caused this mistake?
'Cause I cannot figure it out.

341
00:16:49,717 --> 00:16:51,885
No, we're stumped, but,
don't sweat it, champ.

342
00:16:51,969 --> 00:16:53,554
She's definitely one of ours.

343
00:16:53,637 --> 00:16:56,015
So we'll just roll on out,
and you can get back to,

344
00:16:56,098 --> 00:16:59,476
putting rainbows up your butt
or whatever you do here. Okay?

345
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,895
[claps twice] Let's hit it, sweetheart.
We got a long ride.

346
00:17:01,979 --> 00:17:03,522
What? Right now?

347
00:17:03,605 --> 00:17:06,900
Trevor, for decency's sake,
let her have some good-byes.

348
00:17:06,984 --> 00:17:09,361
[groans] God, good people are the worst.

349
00:17:09,445 --> 00:17:13,282
Okay, uh, 30 minutes.
We gotta get back for <i>The Bachelor.</i>

350
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:15,576
I'm gonna be pissed
if I miss the Rose Ceremony.

351
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:19,329
I just want to say,
once more, for the record,

352
00:17:19,413 --> 00:17:22,499
that this whole good/bad system
is bull-shirt.

353
00:17:24,001 --> 00:17:27,379
There should be a medium place
for people like me

354
00:17:27,463 --> 00:17:30,466
who kind of sucked,
but in, like, a fun, chill way.

355
00:17:30,966 --> 00:17:32,509
I agree. [chuckles softly]

356
00:17:32,801 --> 00:17:34,428
I'm sorry I dragged you into this.

357
00:17:35,429 --> 00:17:37,222
And that I never did laundry.

358
00:17:38,015 --> 00:17:39,433
And that I waited until you were

359
00:17:39,516 --> 00:17:41,727
about to do yours
then secretly tossed mine

360
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:43,896
into the basket
to trick you into doing it.

361
00:17:43,979 --> 00:17:46,148
You didn't trick me.
I repeatedly asked you to stop.

362
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:49,902
Just know you did everything
you could to help me.

363
00:17:49,985 --> 00:17:52,237
You're a really good fake soul mate.

364
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:00,079
[knock at door]

365
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:05,125
What are you guys doing here?

366
00:18:05,292 --> 00:18:07,544
Well, we only thought
it was only proper to see you off.

367
00:18:07,628 --> 00:18:09,171
It's the neighborly thing to do.

368
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:14,760
You guys came to say good-bye
because you're my friends.

369
00:18:14,843 --> 00:18:18,889
Well, I... Suppose some part of me

370
00:18:18,972 --> 00:18:22,810
possibly has a sense
of casual kinship with you.

371
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:25,521
Much as one might be fond of a street cat.

372
00:18:27,189 --> 00:18:28,440
Thanks, Tahani.

373
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:31,151
Sorry about everything.

374
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:34,947
I'm really glad we're friends.

375
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:41,829
Oh, hey, dum-dum.
You ready to go?

376
00:18:41,912 --> 00:18:43,831
Oh, you must be Chidi.

377
00:18:43,914 --> 00:18:46,834
Trying to improve her.
Bold plan, bro.

378
00:18:46,917 --> 00:18:48,752
Well, actually, she learned a great deal

379
00:18:48,836 --> 00:18:50,838
-in a very short amount of time--
-Oh, really? Really?

380
00:18:50,921 --> 00:18:52,589
I don't care.
[claps] All right, let's hit it.

381
00:18:52,673 --> 00:18:55,509
Oh, also, you should smile more.
You have such a pretty smile.

382
00:18:56,009 --> 00:18:58,470
Love you, babe.
Can't wait to torture you.

383
00:19:01,932 --> 00:19:04,726
This is the 3:18 to The Bad Place,

384
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:08,856
making thousands of stops
for literally no reason.

385
00:19:08,939 --> 00:19:12,860
Now, you'll notice it's very hot in here,
and it will get one degree hotter

386
00:19:12,943 --> 00:19:15,237
every time you think
about how hot it is.

387
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:16,655
Oops!

388
00:19:16,905 --> 00:19:18,407
You just thought about it.

389
00:19:19,867 --> 00:19:21,910
-Michael...
-Oh, hi, Chidi.

390
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:23,370
Want some pizza?

391
00:19:23,453 --> 00:19:26,415
Bad Place crew delivered 100
of these to my office.

392
00:19:26,498 --> 00:19:29,418
All Hawaiian, the worst pizza.

393
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:30,669
Michael, I murdered Janet.

394
00:19:32,254 --> 00:19:34,298
I knew about Eleanor from the beginning.

395
00:19:34,381 --> 00:19:36,425
I've been trying to help her
become a better person,

396
00:19:36,508 --> 00:19:38,468
and when she found out
that your retirement meant

397
00:19:38,552 --> 00:19:40,596
that you would be tortured,
she immediately tried

398
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:43,640
to find a way to prevent it.
Eleanor is learning.

399
00:19:43,724 --> 00:19:46,101
She's just doing it after she died.

400
00:19:47,394 --> 00:19:49,229
I did enjoy her company.

401
00:19:50,939 --> 00:19:54,067
But, this is not Little League.

402
00:19:54,151 --> 00:19:57,571
There is no award
for "Most Improved Player," Chidi.

403
00:19:58,363 --> 00:20:00,073
Well, maybe there should be.

404
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:06,914
One final note, the dining car
is at the very back of the train.

405
00:20:06,997 --> 00:20:10,918
It serves only room-temperature
Manhattan clam chowder,

406
00:20:11,001 --> 00:20:13,212
and also, it's closed.

407
00:20:13,837 --> 00:20:15,339
Okay, here we go.

408
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:24,181
-[Michael] Stop this train!
-[train squeals to a stop]

409
00:20:28,602 --> 00:20:30,103
Dude, what the fork?

410
00:20:30,187 --> 00:20:33,065
You're not leaving. Not with her.

411
00:20:33,148 --> 00:20:34,942
Not yet. Come on.

412
00:20:38,946 --> 00:20:40,405
{\an8}[Trevor] Wait, you want to keep her?

413
00:20:40,822 --> 00:20:43,575
{\an8}Bro, that's our girl.
We agreed on this.

414
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:46,787
{\an8}No, what we agreed on was
that this was a mistake.

415
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:49,539
{\an8}Trevor, we're in unchartered
territory here.

416
00:20:49,623 --> 00:20:51,917
{\an8}Until we can sort this out,
she stays with us.

417
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,128
{\an8}All right, fine,
but until this is resolved,

418
00:20:55,212 --> 00:20:56,755
{\an8}we're keeping the other Eleanor.

419
00:20:56,838 --> 00:20:58,215
{\an8}Fine. What? I'm sorry...

420
00:20:58,632 --> 00:21:00,759
{\an8}-The other Eleanor?
-Yeah, the real Eleanor.

421
00:21:00,842 --> 00:21:02,219
{\an8}The one that was supposed to be here

422
00:21:02,302 --> 00:21:04,763
{\an8}but got sent down to us instead?
She's on the train.

423
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:06,890
{\an8}Eleanor, come on out.

424
00:21:13,814 --> 00:21:16,108
{\an8}Hi, everyone, I'm Eleanor Shellstrop.
