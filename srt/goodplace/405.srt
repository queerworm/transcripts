1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:03,586
Oh, Janet, you disappoint me.

2
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:05,839
I expected more of a fight from you.

3
00:00:05,922 --> 00:00:09,175
Yet here you are,
all alone in the Bad Place,

4
00:00:09,259 --> 00:00:12,929
rendered powerless
by a measly magnet jail.

5
00:00:13,012 --> 00:00:14,097
[laughs boisterously]

6
00:00:17,434 --> 00:00:18,476
It's okay, I guess.

7
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,061
What is the issue now, hmm?

8
00:00:20,145 --> 00:00:21,938
That's not how Michael laughs.

9
00:00:22,021 --> 00:00:24,149
It's more of a delighted giggle.

10
00:00:24,232 --> 00:00:25,108
[Shawn] She's right.

11
00:00:25,942 --> 00:00:27,861
You need to nail his subtleties
and mannerisms

12
00:00:27,944 --> 00:00:29,487
for this to properly work as torture.

13
00:00:30,321 --> 00:00:31,156
[sighs]

14
00:00:31,239 --> 00:00:32,449
My problem with the role

15
00:00:32,532 --> 00:00:35,326
is that I haven't fully figured out
Michael's motivation yet.

16
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:39,914
Like, I'm inside Michael,
but I need to be "inside" Michael.

17
00:00:39,998 --> 00:00:42,125
Hmm. You know, it actually
feels more like torture

18
00:00:42,208 --> 00:00:44,419
when you discuss your "acting process."

19
00:00:44,502 --> 00:00:45,462
You don't get it.

20
00:00:45,545 --> 00:00:47,422
If you really wanna know
Michael's motivation,

21
00:00:47,505 --> 00:00:49,382
it's the same as the rest of my friends:

22
00:00:49,466 --> 00:00:51,426
Loyalty, empathy and love.

23
00:00:51,509 --> 00:00:53,678
-Ew.
-And that's why they will prevail.

24
00:00:53,762 --> 00:00:56,681
I hate to break it to you, hon.
They're not gonna prevail.

25
00:00:58,099 --> 00:01:00,477
No one's coming to save you.

26
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:01,394
[laughs maliciously]

27
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:04,689
-Oof. Getting colder.
-I know!

28
00:01:04,773 --> 00:01:06,524
I could feel it. You know, it was wrong.

29
00:01:06,608 --> 00:01:08,151
I'm just... I'm in my head now.

30
00:01:08,234 --> 00:01:09,069
[groans]

31
00:01:10,487 --> 00:01:13,448
[Jason] Hey, Mikey, I have
a question about our plan to save Janet.

32
00:01:14,199 --> 00:01:15,408
Is there it yet?

33
00:01:15,492 --> 00:01:16,868
I do have a plan, yes.

34
00:01:16,951 --> 00:01:19,662
But to be honest,
I have no idea if it will work.

35
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:20,955
Maybe Glenn can help.

36
00:01:21,748 --> 00:01:24,417
Yo, Glenn!
How should we rescue Janet?

37
00:01:24,501 --> 00:01:26,211
{\an8}[bubbling]

38
00:01:26,795 --> 00:01:27,754
He doesn't know.

39
00:01:27,837 --> 00:01:29,589
Listen, Jason, old friend.

40
00:01:29,672 --> 00:01:34,302
I already gave Eleanor and Tahani
all their afterlife memories back.

41
00:01:34,385 --> 00:01:37,847
I haven't restored yours...
for obvious reasons.

42
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:41,309
But I think to maximize
our chances of survival,

43
00:01:41,392 --> 00:01:44,521
it's time that you remember
everything we've been through.

44
00:01:44,604 --> 00:01:47,273
Prepare yourself, this might be intense.

45
00:01:48,733 --> 00:01:53,696
Oh... dip!

46
00:01:54,405 --> 00:01:55,240
[Jason panting]

47
00:01:55,323 --> 00:01:57,367
-Do you remember everything?
-Yes.

48
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:00,703
Last time I was in the Bad Place,
I threw a Molotov cocktail.

49
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:02,038
That was sick.

50
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:04,874
I was afraid that you'd watch
300 years of memories

51
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:06,000
and that would be your takeaway.

52
00:02:06,084 --> 00:02:09,712
Buddy, I did that
to help you know what not to do.

53
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:11,756
Impulse control is critical.

54
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:16,261
Fight the urge to blow stuff up,
even if you feel like we're in a jam.

55
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:17,804
Got it?

56
00:02:18,388 --> 00:02:22,684
I mean, that's very lame,
but, yeah, I understand.

57
00:02:23,893 --> 00:02:25,979
Wait, can I have
all my memories back again?

58
00:02:26,062 --> 00:02:27,438
I forgot most of them.

59
00:02:30,692 --> 00:02:32,694
[theme music playing]

60
00:02:37,198 --> 00:02:38,324
Welcome, everyone!

61
00:02:38,908 --> 00:02:40,743
{\an8}Janet will be unavailable for a bit.

62
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:44,247
{\an8}She's undergoing some
routine system maintenance.

63
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:45,832
{\an8}Oh, I know what that means.

64
00:02:45,915 --> 00:02:47,500
{\an8}Eye lift, maybe an ear tuck.

65
00:02:47,584 --> 00:02:49,502
{\an8}[Chidi] Mmm. Mmm! Mmm.

66
00:02:49,586 --> 00:02:51,296
{\an8}When we don't have Janet,

67
00:02:51,379 --> 00:02:54,924
{\an8}we like to refresh your memories
of your old lives,

68
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:56,676
{\an8}when you did things for yourselves.

69
00:02:56,759 --> 00:02:58,845
{\an8}We call it Earth Day!

70
00:02:58,928 --> 00:03:00,889
{\an8}And, yes, we know that's a thing on Earth,

71
00:03:00,972 --> 00:03:02,640
{\an8}[scoffs] but what are they
gonna do, sue us?

72
00:03:02,724 --> 00:03:03,558
{\an8}[crowd laughs]

73
00:03:03,641 --> 00:03:07,353
{\an8}So, get ready for
some fun, lo-fi activities.

74
00:03:07,437 --> 00:03:10,440
{\an8}-This group over here is gonna knit.
-[gasps]

75
00:03:10,523 --> 00:03:13,401
You folks are gonna do
your favorite activity, gardening.

76
00:03:13,484 --> 00:03:14,402
[cheers]

77
00:03:14,485 --> 00:03:15,945
Oh, man, we better get
something better than that.

78
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:20,199
{\an8}And you five are going
to a gorgeous, remote lake house.

79
00:03:20,283 --> 00:03:22,493
Swimming, waterskiing, the works.

80
00:03:22,577 --> 00:03:24,120
[laughs]

81
00:03:24,203 --> 00:03:25,830
Suck it, gardeners.

82
00:03:25,914 --> 00:03:27,415
{\an8}Why do I feel like
that's not the first time

83
00:03:27,498 --> 00:03:28,708
{\an8}he's screamed those words?

84
00:03:31,753 --> 00:03:35,465
{\an8}Ugh. Get me down from here,
you tiny butthole.

85
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:36,382
{\an8}Ow!

86
00:03:37,634 --> 00:03:40,678
{\an8}Thank you for keeping me safe
from my sexy, bad-girl sister-aunt.

87
00:03:40,762 --> 00:03:41,721
{\an8}Ew.

88
00:03:41,804 --> 00:03:46,059
{\an8}I know that I've caused you a lot
of trouble in the past... Classic Derek.

89
00:03:46,142 --> 00:03:48,478
{\an8}But from now on, I'm here to help.

90
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:49,729
{\an8}I'd feel a lot more confident

91
00:03:49,812 --> 00:03:52,607
{\an8}if you weren't holding a champagne glass
full of <i>Scrabble</i> letters,

92
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:53,900
but you're all we got.

93
00:03:53,983 --> 00:03:56,486
You can keep
the neighborhood running, right?

94
00:03:56,569 --> 00:03:59,405
Well, I wasn't technically
designed for this,

95
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:03,409
[chuckles] but to be fair,
I wasn't designed for anything.

96
00:04:03,493 --> 00:04:06,579
Okay, we're gonna get the humans
far away from the center of town

97
00:04:06,663 --> 00:04:08,081
to help lighten your load.

98
00:04:08,164 --> 00:04:08,998
That would be really great.

99
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:10,208
-Okay.
-Okay.

100
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:11,918
All right, babe, it's go time. You ready?

101
00:04:12,502 --> 00:04:15,338
Absolutely.
I feel very confident with you in charge.

102
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:18,174
In the words of my godfather,
acting in what can only be described

103
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:20,468
in hindsight
as his most problematic role...

104
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:22,470
"You the man now, dawg."

105
00:04:22,971 --> 00:04:25,265
As always, thank you for finding
the quickest possible way to say things.

106
00:04:25,348 --> 00:04:29,519
Now, head off to the lake house,
and do your fabulous Tahani hostess thing!

107
00:04:29,602 --> 00:04:31,312
Actually, uh, now that you bring it up,

108
00:04:31,396 --> 00:04:35,817
Michael and Jason are rescuing Janet
and you're running things here.

109
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:37,527
Even Derek has an important job.

110
00:04:39,487 --> 00:04:40,321
Ah.

111
00:04:40,405 --> 00:04:41,698
I'd like to be more useful.

112
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:43,992
What is it that you Americans say? Uh...

113
00:04:44,075 --> 00:04:45,785
"Insert me, coach man!"

114
00:04:46,369 --> 00:04:47,662
"Put me in, coach."

115
00:04:47,745 --> 00:04:51,457
Babe, we need these humans
to stay happy and occupied.

116
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:53,376
All right? So just
pump 'em full of champagne,

117
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:55,795
and those tiny little sandwiches
and keep 'em dazzled.

118
00:04:55,878 --> 00:04:57,088
[chuckles] Of course.

119
00:04:57,171 --> 00:04:59,590
Though I'd never serve
finger sandwiches at a lake house.

120
00:04:59,674 --> 00:05:01,592
I mean, what am I, Welsh? [chuckles]

121
00:05:01,676 --> 00:05:04,345
Are you? I don't know.
No, right?

122
00:05:07,515 --> 00:05:09,475
Okay. We have to move quietly.

123
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:12,103
We can't be seen by anyone
until we get to Shawn.

124
00:05:12,186 --> 00:05:14,063
It's the only way to rescue Janet.

125
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:15,481
Uh, Michael?

126
00:05:16,524 --> 00:05:17,400
I'm scared.

127
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:18,818
Me, too, bud.

128
00:05:18,901 --> 00:05:22,864
I mean, what if all this time apart
has changed me and Janet's relationship?

129
00:05:22,947 --> 00:05:24,907
What if that special connection is gone?

130
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:26,784
Yeah.

131
00:05:27,535 --> 00:05:31,789
I mean, for me, it's scary that
we're standing in the birthplace of evil,

132
00:05:31,873 --> 00:05:35,084
surrounded by billions of demons
who wanna destroy us.

133
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:36,044
Hmm.

134
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:38,463
I guess we both have things
we're scared about.

135
00:05:40,465 --> 00:05:42,216
[Tahani] Hello, all.

136
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:44,052
I took the liberty of preparing
a few simple snacks.

137
00:05:44,135 --> 00:05:46,637
Ooh! This place is nice.

138
00:05:47,138 --> 00:05:50,975
Did anyone else see that movie
<i>The Lake House</i> with Keanu and Sandy B?

139
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:53,061
Ugh, I love a movie with gentle magic.

140
00:05:53,144 --> 00:05:56,481
Gimme a time-traveling mailbox,
or a mother-daughter body switch,

141
00:05:56,564 --> 00:05:58,733
or, like, Sarah Michelle Gellar as a chef

142
00:05:58,816 --> 00:06:01,861
and her food tastes amazing
because she cries in it. [chuckles]

143
00:06:02,445 --> 00:06:03,696
I should have been a screenwriter.

144
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:05,406
Yeah. This'll do, I guess.

145
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:07,158
I got dibs on the master bedroom.

146
00:06:07,241 --> 00:06:10,661
-Um, Simone? Where's Chidi?
-He decided to just stay at home and read.

147
00:06:10,745 --> 00:06:12,413
He said swimming in lakes scares him.

148
00:06:12,497 --> 00:06:14,499
To be fair, most things scare him.

149
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:17,835
Well, never fear.

150
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:20,463
You all stay and enjoy
the full-sized sandwiches.

151
00:06:20,546 --> 00:06:23,091
I shall go and fetch Chidi. [chuckles]

152
00:06:23,174 --> 00:06:25,259
Tahani is on the job.

153
00:06:26,177 --> 00:06:29,680
Perv 'stache, four eyes...

154
00:06:29,764 --> 00:06:31,349
bee monster.

155
00:06:31,432 --> 00:06:32,517
Whoa!

156
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,643
Is that you?

157
00:06:34,477 --> 00:06:36,104
[Michael] Technically, yes.

158
00:06:36,187 --> 00:06:38,731
But it's a version of me
I no longer recognize.

159
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:42,610
Behind that handsome smile
was so much cruelty,

160
00:06:42,693 --> 00:06:47,573
so much pain inflicted on so many,
with such glee.

161
00:06:48,157 --> 00:06:49,033
Shameful.

162
00:06:50,535 --> 00:06:54,163
What echoes of this former self
await me here?

163
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:55,456
[Jason] I feel you.

164
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:58,334
It was always hard for me to go back
to my old high school.

165
00:06:58,417 --> 00:06:59,752
So many memories.

166
00:07:00,461 --> 00:07:03,297
Also, the junkyard machine
crushed it into tiny cubes.

167
00:07:03,881 --> 00:07:08,386
If we get out of here alive,
remind me to re-erase your teen years.

168
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:15,017
Come on, guys. Hurry back.

169
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:16,102
[exhales heavily]

170
00:07:16,185 --> 00:07:18,104
Oh. Hey, Wanda. Everything okay?

171
00:07:18,187 --> 00:07:20,356
Barg-de-barg-de-barg-de-barg.

172
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,732
Come again?

173
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:24,694
-Oh.
-Barg-de-barg-de-barg-de-barg.

174
00:07:25,486 --> 00:07:27,071
-Derek?
-Oh! Hey!

175
00:07:27,155 --> 00:07:31,701
So, uh... things are... not going well.

176
00:07:31,784 --> 00:07:33,244
-Hi there!
-Hi!

177
00:07:33,828 --> 00:07:34,912
[Eleanor] You said you could handle this.

178
00:07:34,996 --> 00:07:38,332
Yeah, well, it turns out
being a single father to 300 kids

179
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:40,293
is not that easy, Eleanor.

180
00:07:40,376 --> 00:07:43,212
Okay, well, the four humans
are still at the lake house,

181
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:44,964
so we can figure this out.

182
00:07:45,631 --> 00:07:47,675
-What are you doing here?
-I came to get Chidi.

183
00:07:47,758 --> 00:07:48,676
He decided to stay home.

184
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:51,137
Chidi's up there? Right now?

185
00:07:52,388 --> 00:07:54,724
Oh, Chidi, there you are.

186
00:07:54,807 --> 00:07:58,769
Hi. Sorry, I should've told you.
I decided to just stay home and read.

187
00:07:58,853 --> 00:08:01,772
Swimming in lakes scares me,
and so does waterskiing--

188
00:08:01,856 --> 00:08:02,899
We know all that, Chidi.

189
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:05,818
We never expected you
to meet the group at the lake house.

190
00:08:05,902 --> 00:08:09,489
We had a special solo activity
planned for you.

191
00:08:09,572 --> 00:08:11,574
-Really? What is it?
-Mmm-hmm.

192
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:17,872
We have hidden several clues
in this apartment to a puzzle.

193
00:08:17,955 --> 00:08:19,207
Ooh!

194
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:20,833
-[chuckles]
-I love puzzles.

195
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:23,377
They're so much fun,
but they're also like homework. Win-win.

196
00:08:23,461 --> 00:08:25,630
Well, this one's a doozy
because when you solve it,

197
00:08:25,713 --> 00:08:28,049
you get the answer
to the truth about the universe.

198
00:08:28,132 --> 00:08:28,966
[chuckles]

199
00:08:29,634 --> 00:08:31,511
Spoiler alert... I guess.

200
00:08:31,594 --> 00:08:33,971
Hey, Tahani, you've been so helpful,

201
00:08:34,055 --> 00:08:36,849
but everyone's back at the lake house
with no party hostess,

202
00:08:36,933 --> 00:08:38,768
which is obviously less than ideal.

203
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:40,269
So, go on, get.

204
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:42,063
-[chuckles] Of course.
-Yeah.

205
00:08:42,146 --> 00:08:43,439
-Good luck, Chidi.
-Okay.

206
00:08:44,774 --> 00:08:45,858
So, what's my first clue?

207
00:08:47,235 --> 00:08:48,277
You've already gotten it.

208
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:51,405
Ooh!

209
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:53,366
[indistinct chatter]

210
00:08:54,784 --> 00:08:55,868
[Shawn] All right, idiots.

211
00:08:55,952 --> 00:09:01,207
This is hour 52 of the 4,000-hour
presentation on the future of torture.

212
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:04,585
-He's gonna be on stage for 4,000 hours?
-[shushes]

213
00:09:04,669 --> 00:09:06,337
Here's what I think.
We should throw a Molotov--

214
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:08,506
-Jason.
-What? I didn't say cocktail.

215
00:09:08,589 --> 00:09:10,508
I could've meant Molotov anything.
You don't know.

216
00:09:10,591 --> 00:09:12,176
[Michael] Just trust me. I have a plan.

217
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:14,303
Humans are worse than ever.
We have to innovate.

218
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:16,347
Sure, poking sticks work great,

219
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:19,016
but should those sticks
be sharper or hotter?

220
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:21,936
Should they counter-intuitively
be less hot?

221
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:24,689
Let's begin with
slide number one of 7,000.

222
00:09:24,772 --> 00:09:25,690
[clapping]

223
00:09:27,149 --> 00:09:29,068
Nice speech... not!

224
00:09:29,652 --> 00:09:31,320
What's up, dingus?

225
00:09:33,197 --> 00:09:36,158
Oh, no. Oh, that's not good.

226
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:39,996
Oh, what are you guys... Oh, no.
Don't do that. That's not Derek.

227
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:41,330
-Derek.
-[Derek groans]

228
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:42,957
I'm going back to the lake house
to entertain,

229
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,542
because, apparently,
that's all I'm good for.

230
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:46,544
-Okay.
-I'm gonna need some party supplies.

231
00:09:46,627 --> 00:09:49,547
Cocktail napkins with
a cute, lake-related slogan.

232
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:51,924
Maybe they could say
"better lake than never."

233
00:09:52,008 --> 00:09:55,177
Oh, sorry, I've just got
nothing left in the tank.

234
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:59,265
Derek, when you get rebooted,
you become more advanced right?

235
00:09:59,348 --> 00:10:00,308
Yeah.

236
00:10:00,391 --> 00:10:02,560
Well, perhaps then you'd be more capable
of controlling the neighborhood.

237
00:10:02,643 --> 00:10:03,477
Hey, yeah, yeah.

238
00:10:03,561 --> 00:10:06,314
You said you wanted to make this up to us.
Well, now is your chance.

239
00:10:06,397 --> 00:10:07,481
-Yes.
-Yes.

240
00:10:07,565 --> 00:10:08,399
Derek.

241
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:11,319
What are you doing here, Vicky?
You're early.

242
00:10:11,402 --> 00:10:13,529
And do you ever take that suit off?
It smells terrible.

243
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:14,655
It does?

244
00:10:14,739 --> 00:10:15,573
No need to be alarmed.

245
00:10:15,656 --> 00:10:18,534
I know this might look like Michael,
the traitorous slam-pig.

246
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:20,911
However, this is actually
our very own Vicky,

247
00:10:20,995 --> 00:10:22,913
wearing the latest in demon technology:

248
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:25,333
A custom-made, look-alike skinsuit!

249
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:27,168
-Spin around for us, would ya, hon?
-[exclaims]

250
00:10:28,169 --> 00:10:31,464
As you are all aware, our current system
suffers from diminishing returns.

251
00:10:31,547 --> 00:10:34,842
Sure, the first time someone gets
butthole spiders, he's miserable.

252
00:10:34,925 --> 00:10:38,512
But soon, the humans get used to it,
and worse, the spiders get bored.

253
00:10:38,596 --> 00:10:42,475
These personalized skinsuits represent
the dawn of a new era:

254
00:10:42,558 --> 00:10:44,477
Torture 2.0.

255
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,562
-[Michael] Oh! [laughs]
-[crowd cheers]

256
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:52,943
And speaking of which, I figured Demon Con
would be the best place to surprise you

257
00:10:53,027 --> 00:10:55,071
with my greatest invention.

258
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:57,281
Come on out... Jason.

259
00:10:57,365 --> 00:10:58,574
[crowd gasps]

260
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:00,910
[crowd cheers]

261
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:03,329
I had the boys down in R&amp;D
make a Jason suit.

262
00:11:03,412 --> 00:11:05,539
Thought it'd be a fun, new way
to torture Janet.

263
00:11:05,623 --> 00:11:07,833
-Come on. Come on. Here you go.
-I didn't okay this.

264
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:10,211
I know, but, hey, I'm Vicky!

265
00:11:10,294 --> 00:11:11,337
I'm a total munch.

266
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:13,047
That you are. Good point.

267
00:11:13,631 --> 00:11:15,299
Hmm. Not bad.

268
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:18,094
They went a little overboard
on the cheekbones, but still.

269
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:20,096
Wait, who's in there?

270
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:22,556
-Glenn.
-Makes sense.

271
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:23,849
Get an idiot to play an idiot.

272
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:25,893
I was beginning to wonder
where you were, Glenn.

273
00:11:25,976 --> 00:11:28,062
I'm right here... in Jason.

274
00:11:28,813 --> 00:11:30,898
-Definitely not a big bucket of goo.
-[Michael clears throat] Okay.

275
00:11:30,981 --> 00:11:34,860
Say, boss, what do you say we put
these innovative suits of yours to work?

276
00:11:34,944 --> 00:11:38,572
We'll go torture Good Janet
and let you know how it goes.

277
00:11:38,656 --> 00:11:39,990
-Which way is it again?
-Wait.

278
00:11:40,074 --> 00:11:41,450
I have a better idea.

279
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:46,080
I say we torture Good Janet,
right here, right now, live on stage.

280
00:11:46,163 --> 00:11:48,332
-Rufus, go get the Good Janet.
-[crowd cheers]

281
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:50,876
[whispering] This part
of your plan seems risky.

282
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,420
This was not part of my plan.

283
00:11:52,503 --> 00:11:55,131
Oh. Thank God,
I thought you had a bad plan!

284
00:11:57,216 --> 00:12:01,762
Okay, it's easy. Just hit the button.
You've seen Mindy do it a million times.

285
00:12:02,263 --> 00:12:03,472
Yeah, here we go.

286
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:07,059
[sobbing] No, no, no, don't kill me, me.

287
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:08,352
Don't do it.

288
00:12:08,436 --> 00:12:09,812
[groans] Huh.

289
00:12:09,895 --> 00:12:12,398
Now, why is that so hard? I kinda...

290
00:12:12,481 --> 00:12:14,358
You know what? I see what I gotta do.

291
00:12:14,442 --> 00:12:16,068
Just kinda look at this...

292
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:18,195
[screaming] Derek!

293
00:12:23,492 --> 00:12:24,618
Excellent.

294
00:12:26,662 --> 00:12:30,040
-[Eleanor] Dude, what were you thinking?
-[Tahani] I just wanted to be useful.

295
00:12:30,124 --> 00:12:32,209
All I ever get to do here
is throw parties,

296
00:12:32,293 --> 00:12:34,003
which is all I ever got to do
back on Earth

297
00:12:34,086 --> 00:12:35,463
and now I've ruined everything.

298
00:12:35,546 --> 00:12:38,090
No, you gave us a way out.

299
00:12:38,174 --> 00:12:39,216
So, I fixed everything.

300
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:42,636
No, you've made things difficult
in a new way, but I can make it work.

301
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,513
But the important thing is
I did something.

302
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:46,557
-Be quiet and follow my lead.
-Yes, ma'am.

303
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,350
[Eleanor] Chidi? Come on out, bud.

304
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:50,394
Okay. Am I close?

305
00:12:50,478 --> 00:12:53,772
No, there's 4,000 clues in here.
You found five.

306
00:12:53,856 --> 00:12:54,690
I'm just gonna skip to the end.

307
00:12:55,274 --> 00:13:00,029
This puzzle was going to take you
on adventures all over the neighborhood.

308
00:13:00,112 --> 00:13:02,114
Horseback riding,
hot air ballooning and...

309
00:13:02,698 --> 00:13:06,327
I asked Tahani to be involved because
she did all of those things on Earth.

310
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:08,245
You've been in paradise for a month,

311
00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:10,998
and you're still so reluctant
to try new activities.

312
00:13:11,081 --> 00:13:14,877
Yeah, I know, I'm just not
a new-experience kind of guy.

313
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:19,131
I mean, my comfort zone
is basically... that chair.

314
00:13:19,215 --> 00:13:22,176
And, honestly,
the arms are a little sharp.

315
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:25,888
I want you to believe
that you're safe here.

316
00:13:27,389 --> 00:13:28,265
That you can trust me.

317
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:30,976
Do you trust me, Chidi?

318
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:34,230
Yes. I really do.

319
00:13:34,939 --> 00:13:35,898
Then come with me.

320
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:39,985
These personalized skinsuits
are a true game-changer.

321
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:43,739
Imagine being able to torment a human
not as yourself,

322
00:13:43,822 --> 00:13:47,076
but as their wife, or ex-wife,
or just some mouthy broad.

323
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:51,121
They are so convincing,
they even work on a Good Janet!

324
00:13:51,205 --> 00:13:52,998
[Janet grunts] Jeez!

325
00:13:55,042 --> 00:13:57,294
Ugh. Great, more Vicky.

326
00:13:57,378 --> 00:14:00,756
Hey, your Michael impression stinks
almost as much as your suit. [scoffs]

327
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:02,466
-Why does everyone keep saying that?
-Pfft. Oof.

328
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:05,386
Welcome, Janet.
We have a special guest for you today.

329
00:14:05,469 --> 00:14:06,512
[sighs]

330
00:14:06,595 --> 00:14:11,350
Hi, Janet. It's me, Jason.
Your boyfriend.

331
00:14:11,934 --> 00:14:13,477
I really miss you.

332
00:14:14,937 --> 00:14:19,400
I know we were in a fight before,
but I hope you've forgiven me because...

333
00:14:20,401 --> 00:14:22,444
I love you... girl.

334
00:14:23,404 --> 00:14:24,280
Not a girl.

335
00:14:24,822 --> 00:14:26,699
-Well, Janet?
-Yeah.

336
00:14:26,782 --> 00:14:28,242
How's that make you feel?

337
00:14:29,577 --> 00:14:30,786
Terrible. [fake crying]

338
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:31,829
[Michael chuckles]

339
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:35,332
Adequate work, Glenn.

340
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:37,418
-Rufus, take the Janet back to her cell.
-[Janet] No, no, no.

341
00:14:37,501 --> 00:14:40,838
No, please, uh, let us
take Janet back ourselves.

342
00:14:40,921 --> 00:14:43,966
I wanna get a little extra torture time in
on the way there.

343
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:45,384
I don't see why not.

344
00:14:45,467 --> 00:14:46,343
[Vicky as Michael] Hello, dummies.

345
00:14:46,844 --> 00:14:49,013
-It's me, Michael.
-[crowd gasps]

346
00:14:49,096 --> 00:14:52,308
I'm just kidding.
It's me, Vicky, in a Michael suit.

347
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:53,225
[chuckles]

348
00:14:54,268 --> 00:14:55,436
What's going on here?

349
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:58,022
I was never told that I had an understudy.

350
00:15:00,774 --> 00:15:02,776
[Eleanor] There you go, buddy.
You're doing great.

351
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:04,153
Where are we going?

352
00:15:04,236 --> 00:15:06,906
Um... Somewhere fun. Just follow my voice.

353
00:15:10,034 --> 00:15:10,868
Ooh!

354
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:14,580
This is, uh... kinda fun.

355
00:15:15,623 --> 00:15:18,292
I'm very scared, but also... I like it?

356
00:15:19,209 --> 00:15:21,170
-Hi, there.
-Hi, whoever you are.

357
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:22,713
Don't mind us.
We're just doing a trust thing.

358
00:15:23,297 --> 00:15:24,340
Hi, there.

359
00:15:25,382 --> 00:15:26,675
What was that sound?

360
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:28,218
A unicorn died.

361
00:15:28,302 --> 00:15:29,637
-What?
-No.

362
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,221
[stammering] Not a unicorn, my mistake.

363
00:15:31,305 --> 00:15:34,558
Just a regular horse
that someone stabbed in the head.

364
00:15:35,142 --> 00:15:35,976
What?

365
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:36,936
[Eleanor grunts]

366
00:15:37,728 --> 00:15:40,522
What in the name of Kevin Spacey's
self-made Christmas Eve video message

367
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:42,775
to try to get back on
<i>House of Cards</i> is going on here?

368
00:15:42,858 --> 00:15:43,901
-[whispering] Mike.
-[Shawn] Who are you?

369
00:15:43,984 --> 00:15:45,027
[Vicky as Michael] Who am I?

370
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:46,737
-[Shawn] Who are you?
-You had this the whole time?

371
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:49,073
Yeah. I wanted to explode
a bunch of demons,

372
00:15:49,156 --> 00:15:51,200
but you told me I should wait, so I did.

373
00:15:51,283 --> 00:15:54,286
Vicky, why did you build
a second Michael suit?

374
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:57,039
He didn't. No, I mean, I didn't.

375
00:15:57,122 --> 00:15:58,958
[stammers] Oh. Look...

376
00:16:00,084 --> 00:16:01,877
[crowd gasps and exclaims]

377
00:16:03,045 --> 00:16:04,463
It can't be.

378
00:16:04,546 --> 00:16:06,840
Yes, it's true.

379
00:16:06,924 --> 00:16:09,218
It's me, the real Michael.

380
00:16:09,301 --> 00:16:12,596
We know all about your plot
to sabotage our experiment.

381
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:15,766
We know you brought Chris in
to pretend to be Linda

382
00:16:15,849 --> 00:16:18,811
to distract us
while you planted a Bad Janet

383
00:16:18,894 --> 00:16:20,813
to pretend to be a Good Janet.

384
00:16:22,189 --> 00:16:23,732
No, stop clapping. This is real.

385
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:24,942
Someone capture them.

386
00:16:25,025 --> 00:16:26,819
Rufus, I'm warning you.

387
00:16:26,902 --> 00:16:28,779
I know we go way back.
We used to be roommates.

388
00:16:28,862 --> 00:16:33,200
But if you take another step,
I will use this demon exploder on you.

389
00:16:33,283 --> 00:16:35,160
A "demon exploder"? Come on, man.

390
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:37,204
At least try to make
that sound convincing.

391
00:16:37,955 --> 00:16:38,789
[crowd gasps]

392
00:16:39,373 --> 00:16:40,207
Wow.

393
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:42,251
Touché.

394
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:45,254
I used to be just like all of you.

395
00:16:45,337 --> 00:16:49,800
I sat right where you're sitting,
at more than 10,000 Demon Cons,

396
00:16:49,883 --> 00:16:52,011
and I believed that we committed torture

397
00:16:52,094 --> 00:16:55,222
as a part of the moral balance
of the universe.

398
00:16:55,305 --> 00:16:57,307
But I've learned that's wrong.

399
00:16:57,391 --> 00:17:00,936
Humans are capable of self-improvement,
and so are we.

400
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:04,231
And down deep,
Shawn knows this is true, too.

401
00:17:04,732 --> 00:17:08,360
I beg you, open your eyes to the truth.

402
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:10,195
[slow clapping]

403
00:17:13,073 --> 00:17:14,116
Bravo, Michael.

404
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:16,785
What a monologue... not!

405
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:17,786
[crowd laughs]

406
00:17:19,997 --> 00:17:21,165
I'm not scared of you.

407
00:17:21,248 --> 00:17:25,085
Because I've gone there, Michael.
I've become you.

408
00:17:25,169 --> 00:17:29,840
You may act like you've changed,
but deep down, you're still a demon.

409
00:17:29,923 --> 00:17:34,136
Vile, ugly, capable of so much darkness.

410
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:35,095
And now...

411
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:37,514
you're home.

412
00:17:37,598 --> 00:17:38,849
[crowd gasps]

413
00:17:38,932 --> 00:17:40,017
Oh, come on!

414
00:17:41,435 --> 00:17:43,562
-[Michael] Let's go. Come on.
-Let's go.

415
00:17:43,645 --> 00:17:47,066
[Shawn] No, you morons. Stop
applauding them. They're getting away.

416
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:51,361
I swear, the production value at Demon Con
gets better every year.

417
00:17:53,155 --> 00:17:55,240
Man, look at this house.

418
00:17:55,324 --> 00:17:57,868
And that beautiful lake.
I can't believe I almost missed all this.

419
00:17:59,203 --> 00:18:01,121
Is this the answer
to the truth about the universe?

420
00:18:01,205 --> 00:18:03,415
-Well--
-Uh... Part of it.

421
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:05,042
Oh!

422
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:06,877
The puzzle continues.

423
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,463
Hey, you decided to come after all.

424
00:18:09,546 --> 00:18:10,964
I did.

425
00:18:11,548 --> 00:18:13,592
Thanks to Eleanor and Tahani.

426
00:18:13,675 --> 00:18:15,636
[Simone] Aw! You two are the best.

427
00:18:15,719 --> 00:18:17,012
Well, that was insane.

428
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:20,140
But we got through it... together.

429
00:18:21,308 --> 00:18:22,309
No, we didn't.

430
00:18:23,018 --> 00:18:23,977
You got through it.

431
00:18:24,728 --> 00:18:26,688
I almost ruined it a hundred times.

432
00:18:27,189 --> 00:18:29,858
From now on, I'm just gonna
stick to throwing parties,

433
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:31,443
because it's the only thing I'm good at.

434
00:18:31,527 --> 00:18:32,736
[scoffs and fake sobs]

435
00:18:35,239 --> 00:18:36,490
-Hey.
-What?

436
00:18:36,573 --> 00:18:39,451
When I said "throw a party,"
I didn't mean a pity party.

437
00:18:39,535 --> 00:18:42,329
This isn't a pity party.
I'm genuinely sad.

438
00:18:42,412 --> 00:18:45,249
The only thing I can do
is throw pointless parties.

439
00:18:45,332 --> 00:18:47,876
You run the entire neighborhood.
You're so capable.

440
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:51,505
I have seen you get stuck
in any manner of crazy situation,

441
00:18:51,588 --> 00:18:53,423
and you always figure a way out.

442
00:18:53,507 --> 00:18:57,594
Yeah, man, because I've had to
scrape and claw my way through life,

443
00:18:57,678 --> 00:19:02,182
and you grew up in a castle full of
diamond lamps and golden pillowcases.

444
00:19:02,266 --> 00:19:03,934
You never learned
how to think on your feet.

445
00:19:04,017 --> 00:19:06,186
Look, if the roles were reversed,

446
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:10,023
and I had to throw a fancy party
to save all of humanity,

447
00:19:10,107 --> 00:19:11,400
I promise we'd be screwed,

448
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:16,363
because I wouldn't know what salad fork
to put next to the... whatever spoon.

449
00:19:17,531 --> 00:19:20,576
The whatever spoon is really only used
for certain festive jellies.

450
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:21,577
See?

451
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:24,454
Babe, the dodos in that house

452
00:19:24,538 --> 00:19:29,168
are literally the four most important
human beings in the universe.

453
00:19:29,251 --> 00:19:31,879
I wanted you to take care of them
because I trust you.

454
00:19:31,962 --> 00:19:33,714
Plus, your parties aren't pointless.

455
00:19:33,797 --> 00:19:36,758
They're opportunities for them
to bond and form friendships.

456
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:42,306
You know, the thing we need them to do
so we're not all tortured forever?

457
00:19:43,348 --> 00:19:44,183
You're right.

458
00:19:44,808 --> 00:19:46,268
And thank you.

459
00:19:46,977 --> 00:19:48,478
But if we ever get through this,

460
00:19:48,562 --> 00:19:51,481
I want to learn
how to do something meaningful.

461
00:19:51,565 --> 00:19:55,068
A real skill.
Something helpful and fulfilling.

462
00:19:55,152 --> 00:19:57,279
Okay, man, if we survive this,

463
00:19:57,362 --> 00:20:00,407
I promise I will support you while you...

464
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,493
-learn to weld or whatever, deal?
-[chuckles]

465
00:20:04,578 --> 00:20:05,412
Deal.

466
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:10,792
[fires]

467
00:20:11,376 --> 00:20:13,212
That oughta stop them from following us.

468
00:20:13,295 --> 00:20:14,379
So smart.

469
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:16,089
Nice to have you back, Janet.

470
00:20:16,673 --> 00:20:19,468
That must have been hard for you...
to go back there.

471
00:20:20,969 --> 00:20:21,803
It was.

472
00:20:22,763 --> 00:20:25,724
I don't like thinking about
who I used to be.

473
00:20:25,807 --> 00:20:26,683
[Jason] Listen, Michael,

474
00:20:26,767 --> 00:20:32,522
it's okay to feel or plead guilty
about bad things you used to do,

475
00:20:32,606 --> 00:20:34,983
but you don't have to feel shame
about who you were,

476
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:37,486
because you're not a demon anymore.

477
00:20:37,569 --> 00:20:40,197
You're just like a nice, weird,
happy old dude.

478
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:42,282
Huh. [chuckles]

479
00:20:43,033 --> 00:20:44,243
{\an8}Thanks for rescuing me.

480
00:20:44,785 --> 00:20:45,994
{\an8}I missed you so much.

481
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:47,120
{\an8}I missed you, too.

482
00:20:47,204 --> 00:20:48,789
{\an8}Bad Janet was so mean to me.

483
00:20:49,373 --> 00:20:52,918
{\an8}She told me so many lies.
She said the Jags cut Blake Bortles.

484
00:20:53,001 --> 00:20:53,919
{\an8}Can you believe that?

485
00:20:54,002 --> 00:20:54,836
{\an8}Oh, no.

486
00:20:55,462 --> 00:20:56,797
{\an8}Jason, that wasn't a lie.

487
00:20:57,422 --> 00:20:59,633
{\an8}Blake Bortles was cut by the Jaguars.

488
00:20:59,716 --> 00:21:01,343
{\an8}What? How? Why?

489
00:21:02,302 --> 00:21:03,470
{\an8}Who's their QB now?

490
00:21:03,553 --> 00:21:05,013
{\an8}A man named Nick Foles.

491
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:06,974
{\an8}Nick Foles? Are you kidding me?

492
00:21:08,725 --> 00:21:12,145
{\an8}He won a Super Bowl!
We're gonna be unstoppable!

493
00:21:12,729 --> 00:21:13,814
{\an8}Foles!

494
00:21:13,897 --> 00:21:17,734
-Foles! [chuckles]
-Foles!

495
00:21:17,818 --> 00:21:20,153
[Janet] Oh, no.
Nick Foles just broke his clavicle.

496
00:21:20,237 --> 00:21:22,197
[Jason] No!
