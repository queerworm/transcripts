1
00:00:02,168 --> 00:00:04,129
[Michael] This library is depressing.

2
00:00:04,212 --> 00:00:08,508
All they have in the poetry section
is Jeff Foxworthy books.

3
00:00:08,591 --> 00:00:10,135
Well, we needed some place deserted,

4
00:00:10,218 --> 00:00:13,888
and there is no place more deserted
than a public library in Arizona.

5
00:00:13,972 --> 00:00:15,056
Now, let's go, man.

6
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:16,182
We only have a few hours

7
00:00:16,266 --> 00:00:18,143
before we have to pick the gang up
from the airport.

8
00:00:18,226 --> 00:00:19,894
Fire up Janet's memory gizmo.

9
00:00:19,978 --> 00:00:23,398
Flooding your brain with memories
from the afterlife is dangerous.

10
00:00:23,481 --> 00:00:26,401
In one of the reboots,
you and Chidi were in love.

11
00:00:26,484 --> 00:00:29,404
-Can't you just take my word for that?
-No, dude. I can't.

12
00:00:29,487 --> 00:00:31,573
My screwed-up relationship with my parents

13
00:00:31,656 --> 00:00:33,867
made me believe
I could never really love anyone.

14
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:35,285
I need to see it for myself.

15
00:00:35,368 --> 00:00:36,911
Those are my memories.

16
00:00:36,995 --> 00:00:38,329
I want them back.

17
00:00:38,413 --> 00:00:40,040
Okay, fine. Have a seat.

18
00:00:41,332 --> 00:00:43,418
Luckily, before we shut
the neighborhood down,

19
00:00:43,501 --> 00:00:47,338
Janet saved a complete record
of all the reboots.

20
00:00:47,422 --> 00:00:48,423
Put those in your ears.

21
00:00:53,344 --> 00:00:54,929
-What's all that for?
-You'll see.

22
00:00:55,013 --> 00:00:57,557
We're going to start with a simple,
three-second memory.

23
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:59,559
-Why only three second--
-[phone beeps]

24
00:01:00,226 --> 00:01:02,645
-Oh, hi, Eleanor.
<i>-Buongiorno, </i>Eleanor.

25
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:04,481
Morning, Bambadjan. Morning, Vicky.

26
00:01:04,564 --> 00:01:06,816
Ugh. Those two are such forking dweebs.

27
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:07,901
[phone beeps]

28
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:12,572
As I told you, recalling
afterlife memories here on Earth

29
00:01:12,655 --> 00:01:15,200
has some significant side effects.

30
00:01:15,283 --> 00:01:18,745
You should be back to normal
in about 20 minutes.

31
00:01:18,828 --> 00:01:20,997
[coughing]

32
00:01:23,708 --> 00:01:25,710
[theme music playing]

33
00:01:30,048 --> 00:01:32,801
[Michael] Ah! Looking a little better.
Banana must have helped.

34
00:01:32,884 --> 00:01:35,595
Before we go any further,
I have one very important question.

35
00:01:35,678 --> 00:01:37,639
{\an8}Did I look hot bald?

36
00:01:37,722 --> 00:01:39,641
{\an8}'Cause I always kinda felt like
I could pull it off.

37
00:01:39,724 --> 00:01:43,478
{\an8}I have no real ability to gauge
physical attractiveness in humans.

38
00:01:44,437 --> 00:01:46,564
{\an8}But no. You did not pull it off.

39
00:01:46,648 --> 00:01:51,111
{\an8}Okay, that short clip should have
rewired your brain like an inoculation.

40
00:01:51,194 --> 00:01:55,031
{\an8}So now I can show you the highlights.
Reboot 119.

41
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:57,575
{\an8}I'm skipping
all of the sleeping and chewing.

42
00:01:57,659 --> 00:01:59,327
{\an8}You guys are always either sleeping

43
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:01,830
{\an8}-or chewing something.
-[phone beeps]

44
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:08,044
{\an8}So, we are moving on to the subject
of free will versus determinism.

45
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:10,004
{\an8}We are officially done with Nietzsche.

46
00:02:10,088 --> 00:02:12,173
{\an8}Oh, I'm gonna miss Nietzsche.

47
00:02:12,757 --> 00:02:15,552
{\an8}I spent a lot of my life
thinking I was better than everyone else.

48
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:17,887
{\an8}And he showed me why I was right.

49
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:19,055
{\an8}Give me that reading list.

50
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:20,265
{\an8}What do we got?

51
00:02:20,348 --> 00:02:25,353
{\an8}Ooh. A little Aristotle, little Descartes,
little Tommy Quine-Quine.

52
00:02:25,436 --> 00:02:26,980
{\an8}That's what I call St. Thomas Aquinas.

53
00:02:27,063 --> 00:02:28,439
{\an8}Three months of philosophy class

54
00:02:28,523 --> 00:02:29,899
{\an8}and you're already...

55
00:02:33,069 --> 00:02:34,070
{\an8}[sneezes]

56
00:02:34,863 --> 00:02:35,864
{\an8}Hmm.

57
00:02:39,075 --> 00:02:40,493
{\an8}What are you grinning at, weirdo?

58
00:02:40,577 --> 00:02:41,411
{\an8}[chuckles softly]

59
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:45,039
{\an8}Come on. We're going to be late
for the neighborhood meeting.

60
00:02:45,707 --> 00:02:47,333
{\an8}-I gotta say, it seems like I was...
-[phone beeps]

61
00:02:47,417 --> 00:02:49,043
{\an8}...really nailing that philosophy class.

62
00:02:49,127 --> 00:02:51,045
Can you believe my high school voted me

63
00:02:51,129 --> 00:02:53,214
most likely to die young
and unaccomplished?

64
00:02:53,298 --> 00:02:55,717
You did die young and unaccomplished.

65
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:56,843
Fair enough.

66
00:02:56,926 --> 00:02:58,469
-Put those back in.
-[phone beeps]

67
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:02,348
[Michael] Ah, my favorite four residents.

68
00:03:02,432 --> 00:03:04,809
Don't tell the others. [laughs]

69
00:03:04,893 --> 00:03:06,811
Welcome to "Pick a Pet" day.

70
00:03:06,895 --> 00:03:10,315
We have hundreds of beautiful animals
for you to choose from.

71
00:03:10,398 --> 00:03:16,195
And when you do make your choice,
your pet will bond to your soul forever.

72
00:03:16,279 --> 00:03:17,196
[Tahani] Fabulous.

73
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:20,742
I haven't had a pet since Barbra Streisand
gave me one of her cloned Siamese cats

74
00:03:20,825 --> 00:03:22,994
-and it killed itself.
-Ah.

75
00:03:23,077 --> 00:03:24,662
I'm going to look at
the mythical pets, darling.

76
00:03:24,746 --> 00:03:25,830
Catch up when you're ready.

77
00:03:25,914 --> 00:03:27,206
-May I?
-Yes.

78
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:30,043
Dude, we can get mythical animals!

79
00:03:30,126 --> 00:03:31,294
Maybe I'll get a penguin.

80
00:03:31,377 --> 00:03:32,837
Penguins are real.

81
00:03:32,921 --> 00:03:34,672
That's the spirit, Eleanor.

82
00:03:35,381 --> 00:03:36,507
They're real to me, too.

83
00:03:40,762 --> 00:03:45,016
{\an8}Oh! This one looks just like the one
I had when I was a little kid.

84
00:03:45,099 --> 00:03:46,976
He's so cute!

85
00:03:48,311 --> 00:03:50,897
But is... is this one a little cuter?

86
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:57,654
I mean, this pup looks friskier,
but this one's a little sweeter maybe?

87
00:03:57,737 --> 00:04:01,658
Uh-oh. It's Chidi kryptonite.
The choice between any two things.

88
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:04,244
Settle in, lizard.
This is gonna be a while.

89
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:08,039
{\an8}Michael, what's a mirror centaur?

90
00:04:08,122 --> 00:04:10,416
Ah. A stunning creature,

91
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:14,504
whose human half takes on
the image of its companion.

92
00:04:15,672 --> 00:04:20,343
{\an8}Greetings. I am Tahania.
Goddess of beauty.

93
00:04:21,511 --> 00:04:22,887
Oh, my.

94
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:26,391
[Chidi] Should I take the cutest puppy
or is that shallow?

95
00:04:26,474 --> 00:04:29,102
And is it even okay to separate them?

96
00:04:29,185 --> 00:04:32,480
Are they brother and sister,
or perhaps married?

97
00:04:32,563 --> 00:04:33,606
Dude, they're heaven-puppies.

98
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:36,609
I'm sure they're both incredible.
Just choose one.

99
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:38,861
You're right. The black one!

100
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:41,447
That was my first impulse,
and that is the one I'll take!

101
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:44,409
{\an8}[Janet] I’m so sorry, Chidi.
Both puppies have been taken.

102
00:04:44,492 --> 00:04:46,327
Yeah. I should’ve seen that coming.

103
00:04:46,411 --> 00:04:49,872
My indecision has once again
cost me happiness,

104
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:52,166
and I will now suffer the consequences.

105
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:53,626
How many pets have gone unclaimed?

106
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:57,297
-Three. A 16-foot albino python.
-Mmm-mmm.

107
00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:01,426
Something called a tarantula squid,
and this owl.

108
00:05:01,509 --> 00:05:05,179
Tarantula squid! Tarantula squid!
Tarantula squid! Tarantula squid!

109
00:05:05,263 --> 00:05:06,681
I'll take the owl.

110
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:11,394
Check it out! Janet made him
a little cowboy hat! Isn't that stupid?

111
00:05:11,477 --> 00:05:12,729
[chuckles]

112
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:14,439
Chidi? Hello?

113
00:05:14,522 --> 00:05:16,607
[shushes] Spencer doesn't like
loud voices!

114
00:05:17,191 --> 00:05:19,652
Eesh, what happened, man?

115
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:22,030
Well, I was trying to teach him
to play fetch,

116
00:05:22,113 --> 00:05:23,906
like I did with my puppy as a kid.

117
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:25,908
But instead of retrieving the stick,

118
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:29,829
he attacked my face
with his razor-sharp talons.

119
00:05:29,912 --> 00:05:32,290
Why don't you just ask Michael for a dog?

120
00:05:32,373 --> 00:05:35,376
Because it was my mistake
to not pick a puppy fast enough.

121
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:38,588
I made my bed, and now I'll bleed in it.

122
00:05:38,671 --> 00:05:40,256
[sighs] Let me do that, dummy. Come here.

123
00:05:41,257 --> 00:05:44,302
What if I talk to Michael for you?

124
00:05:44,385 --> 00:05:47,346
That way you don't have to worry
about feeling ungrateful, or whatever,

125
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:50,725
and maybe you'll still get a puppy,
instead of...

126
00:05:50,808 --> 00:05:51,726
Ow!

127
00:05:51,809 --> 00:05:53,227
...deep wounds.

128
00:05:53,311 --> 00:05:54,562
-You'd do that?
-Of course.

129
00:05:54,645 --> 00:05:57,982
It's the least I can do,
considering everything you've done for me.

130
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:03,154
-So you get it, right?
-Hey!

131
00:06:03,237 --> 00:06:05,323
What? You liked him, he liked you.

132
00:06:05,406 --> 00:06:06,908
You did nice things for each other.

133
00:06:06,991 --> 00:06:10,411
Your lack of parental affection
did not make you numb to love,

134
00:06:10,495 --> 00:06:11,496
blah, blah, blah.

135
00:06:11,579 --> 00:06:15,583
"Blah, blah, blah?" Why don't you want me
to see this? What are you hiding?

136
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:19,295
Nothing. It's just,
the rest is not interesting.

137
00:06:19,378 --> 00:06:21,422
Yeah, no, you're right.
"Not that interesting."

138
00:06:21,506 --> 00:06:24,550
Just watching myself fall in love
for the first time in fake heaven.

139
00:06:24,634 --> 00:06:25,468
What else is on?

140
00:06:26,177 --> 00:06:30,181
I am going to put this back in my ear,
and you are going to show me

141
00:06:30,264 --> 00:06:33,434
how thoughtful and caring I am,
or I'm gonna rip off your demon head

142
00:06:33,518 --> 00:06:35,978
and shove it up whatever's where
your butt should be.

143
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:36,938
Roll it!

144
00:06:40,566 --> 00:06:43,319
Aw! A lizard was
a perfect choice, Eleanor.

145
00:06:43,402 --> 00:06:46,239
-You both have combination skin!
-Thanks.

146
00:06:46,322 --> 00:06:49,534
Hey, this is a weird question to ask.
I'll just throw it out there.

147
00:06:49,617 --> 00:06:50,868
Can I ride your centaur?

148
00:06:50,952 --> 00:06:55,164
I'm afraid Tahania's quite particular
about whom she allows to ride her.

149
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:58,709
I tried, and she gave me
a withering stare.

150
00:06:58,793 --> 00:07:00,586
Turns out centaurs are a bit tricky.

151
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:03,965
You didn't have, like,
a stable full of horses growing up?

152
00:07:04,048 --> 00:07:05,967
Of course,
but they just pulled our carriages,

153
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:08,469
or performed in our horse ballets.
They weren't so...

154
00:07:08,553 --> 00:07:10,721
-what's the word?
-[hooves clopping]

155
00:07:10,805 --> 00:07:11,639
Judgmental.

156
00:07:11,722 --> 00:07:14,100
[Tahania] With whom can I speak
about acquiring new shoes?

157
00:07:14,183 --> 00:07:16,102
You can't expect me to walk around
in these flats all day,

158
00:07:16,185 --> 00:07:18,479
like some common glue-factory hobo horse.

159
00:07:18,563 --> 00:07:19,981
Eleanor? You were looking for me?

160
00:07:20,064 --> 00:07:23,025
Uh, yeah! So, Chidi chose an owl

161
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:25,486
because he froze up trying to decide
between two puppies.

162
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:27,280
Is it possible for him to swap?

163
00:07:27,363 --> 00:07:29,282
Of course. This is the Good Place.

164
00:07:29,991 --> 00:07:33,953
But he might want to hold off.
Tonight, we're having a party

165
00:07:34,036 --> 00:07:38,040
where everyone gets to transform into
their pets for a few minutes, as a treat!

166
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:42,462
Chidi can fly like an owl,
and you can do whatever lizards do!

167
00:07:43,379 --> 00:07:46,299
Tahani, would you host the party
at your mansion?

168
00:07:46,382 --> 00:07:48,468
Of course! I'd love to.

169
00:07:49,594 --> 00:07:51,262
Is that what you're going to wear?

170
00:07:51,345 --> 00:07:55,766
What? No. Of course not. Why?
[chuckling nervously]

171
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:59,353
[stammering] Is it unflattering?
I can change.

172
00:08:00,771 --> 00:08:02,565
Guys, can’t find my lizard.

173
00:08:02,648 --> 00:08:04,775
He was just out there like one second ago.

174
00:08:04,859 --> 00:08:06,611
No big deal.
Janet can find it.

175
00:08:06,694 --> 00:08:08,237
No. I can’t risk it.

176
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:11,449
These pets are supposed to, like,
bond to our souls forever.

177
00:08:11,532 --> 00:08:13,075
If Michael finds out mine ran away,

178
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:14,744
he could figure out
I’m not the real Eleanor.

179
00:08:15,453 --> 00:08:17,455
Just, um, go without me.

180
00:08:17,538 --> 00:08:19,999
And tell people
that I’m hanging out with my lizard

181
00:08:20,082 --> 00:08:23,586
because we are so meshed together,
or whatever.

182
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:24,545
Circle of life, crap like that.

183
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:27,673
-You sure?
-Yeah. Go enjoy flying.

184
00:08:27,757 --> 00:08:29,675
-I’ll meet you there.
-[Jason] Come on, Blake.

185
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:33,262
Lizard? Lizard!

186
00:08:34,305 --> 00:08:37,225
Where the fork are you?
Lizard!

187
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:39,560
Ugh! Why didn't I name you?

188
00:08:41,062 --> 00:08:42,647
-Hey.
-[screams]

189
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:43,898
Why?

190
00:08:43,981 --> 00:08:45,650
Oh, no! Chidi!

191
00:08:46,817 --> 00:08:49,445
Sorry I shoved you, man.
I've just been a little jumpy.

192
00:08:50,613 --> 00:08:52,406
Hey, you didn't happen to see
my lizard in the lake,

193
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:53,783
when you were thrashing around down there?

194
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:57,328
No. It was cold and dark and scary.

195
00:08:57,411 --> 00:08:59,455
But don’t worry. We'll find him.

196
00:09:00,289 --> 00:09:03,209
Michael and Janet
are busy transforming people anyway,

197
00:09:03,292 --> 00:09:04,961
so they didn't even notice
you weren't there.

198
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:07,463
Holy crap. You're supposed
to be flying right now.

199
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:10,091
It's no big deal. I just decided
I'd rather be...

200
00:09:10,841 --> 00:09:12,051
helping you.

201
00:09:12,134 --> 00:09:15,221
Than soaring through the air
like an owl?

202
00:09:15,304 --> 00:09:16,681
That's amazing.

203
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:19,475
You're amazing.

204
00:09:22,853 --> 00:09:25,606
[Michael] <i>After that, you spent</i>
<i>all your time together.</i>

205
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:28,150
<i>You studied philosophy together.</i>

206
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:30,194
<i>You even got Chidi </i>
<i>hooked on popcorn shrimp.</i>

207
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:33,281
<i>Eventually, you became suspicious of me,</i>

208
00:09:33,364 --> 00:09:36,325
<i>and escaped to Mindy St. Claire's house</i>
<i>on a train.</i>

209
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:39,245
<i>That was the first time</i>
<i>you actually said it out loud.</i>

210
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:40,913
I love you.

211
00:09:41,956 --> 00:09:44,375
And you don’t need to respond, 'cause...

212
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:46,002
I know you have trouble
saying how you feel.

213
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:47,295
I love you, too.

214
00:09:51,757 --> 00:09:52,675
That's the story.

215
00:09:52,758 --> 00:09:54,927
You're capable of human love. Congrats.

216
00:09:55,678 --> 00:09:57,930
-Can we go now?
-How did it end?

217
00:09:58,014 --> 00:10:02,101
Like it always did, with me rebooting you.
There's no need to--

218
00:10:02,184 --> 00:10:04,186
-Show me, please.
-[phone beeps]

219
00:10:04,854 --> 00:10:07,982
[yawns] All right, let's get this
over with. So, listen, guys--

220
00:10:08,065 --> 00:10:09,984
No, you listen!

221
00:10:10,067 --> 00:10:11,944
We just went to Mindy St. Claire's,

222
00:10:12,028 --> 00:10:15,656
and when she wasn't trying to trick us
into having a threesome,

223
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:17,825
she filled us in on everything
that you've been up to here.

224
00:10:17,908 --> 00:10:18,993
Oh, yeah?

225
00:10:19,076 --> 00:10:21,579
We know this is the hundredth time
you've tried to torture us,

226
00:10:21,662 --> 00:10:23,664
but this time it's different because...

227
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:26,083
we're in love.

228
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:29,587
And love is stronger
than anything you can throw at us.

229
00:10:30,171 --> 00:10:33,507
No, it's not. Love is stronger
than anything I can throw at you?

230
00:10:34,258 --> 00:10:35,676
I could throw an elephant at you.

231
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,888
You think a thrown elephant
wouldn't crush you because of love?

232
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:40,514
She was speaking metaphorically.

233
00:10:40,598 --> 00:10:42,391
Even metaphorically, it's lame.

234
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:46,646
It's okay. No matter what he does,
we will find each other,

235
00:10:47,229 --> 00:10:50,358
and we will help each other
because we're soul mates.

236
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:52,818
[blows raspberry]

237
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:56,280
There's no such thing as soul mates,
you dingus.

238
00:10:57,365 --> 00:10:58,741
I made it up.

239
00:10:58,824 --> 00:11:01,577
I put clowns in your house
because you hate them.

240
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:06,248
I forced you to choose the lizard,
and then I made that lizard run away.

241
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:10,628
I made it all up!
Don't you understand that? [scoffs]

242
00:11:12,463 --> 00:11:14,882
That's why I didn't want to give you
your memories back.

243
00:11:14,965 --> 00:11:17,510
I didn't want you to see
how cruel I used to be.

244
00:11:18,302 --> 00:11:20,721
Plus, I wore a lot of French cuff shirts
back then,

245
00:11:20,805 --> 00:11:24,058
I thought it made me look classy,
but it's... it's all embarrassing.

246
00:11:24,141 --> 00:11:26,477
But I'm different now, I promise.

247
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,771
I'll swear on a Bible, like you humans do.

248
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:29,897
I could grab one right now.

249
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:32,358
It's the only book they have
in the sex-ed section.

250
00:11:32,441 --> 00:11:33,859
-I'm not mad at you.
-[stammers]

251
00:11:33,943 --> 00:11:36,445
I can't be mad at a demon for being evil.

252
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:43,035
I'm just sad because I thought,
for a second, I could love someone.

253
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:46,163
But really,
it was just you manipulating me

254
00:11:46,247 --> 00:11:48,082
into thinking I loved someone.

255
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:52,420
So, I guess I was right.
I'm incapable of love.

256
00:11:55,089 --> 00:11:57,716
Eh. That's no biggie.
Do you wanna get burgers?

257
00:11:58,300 --> 00:11:59,135
[sighs]

258
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:03,514
Hang on now.
How did you draw that conclusion?

259
00:12:03,597 --> 00:12:06,767
You just watched yourself
fall in love with Chidi.

260
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:10,563
No, I didn't. I watched a puppeteer
pull a bunch of strings

261
00:12:10,646 --> 00:12:12,815
to make us think we were in love.

262
00:12:12,898 --> 00:12:15,025
You said it yourself, you made it all up.

263
00:12:15,109 --> 00:12:18,529
Okay, yes.
I put you and Chidi in close proximity

264
00:12:18,612 --> 00:12:20,948
because I needed you
to drive each other crazy.

265
00:12:21,031 --> 00:12:23,993
But I never intended
for you to fall in love.

266
00:12:24,076 --> 00:12:26,787
Once you made us bond,
the romance was inevitable.

267
00:12:26,871 --> 00:12:29,039
It's a basic reality-show playbook.

268
00:12:29,123 --> 00:12:32,376
Put a bunch of attractive young people
in stressful situations

269
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:34,378
so they act like idiots
and have sex with each other.

270
00:12:34,462 --> 00:12:37,339
This is all just... determinism.

271
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:38,716
What?

272
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:43,012
{\an8}"Determinism is the theory that we have
no control over our own actions.

273
00:12:43,095 --> 00:12:45,806
{\an8}Everything we do happens
because of some external force,

274
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:48,017
{\an8}which exists outside of our control."

275
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:52,271
I didn't choose to fall in love with Chidi
because some all-knowing demon, you,

276
00:12:52,354 --> 00:12:53,856
brought us together
and scripted our lives.

277
00:12:53,939 --> 00:12:57,610
That's ridiculous.
I didn't make you kiss Chidi by that lake.

278
00:12:57,693 --> 00:13:01,197
You kinda did. You orchestrated
the whole Pet Day thing,

279
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,866
manipulated us
into choosing specific animals,

280
00:13:03,949 --> 00:13:05,075
made my lizard run away,

281
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:07,077
which led to Chidi coming
to help me find it,

282
00:13:07,161 --> 00:13:10,039
which led to us kissing,
which led to us falling in love.

283
00:13:10,122 --> 00:13:11,373
None of that was my choice.

284
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:14,710
Everything in my life has been determined

285
00:13:14,793 --> 00:13:17,922
by my upbringing, my genetics
or my environment,

286
00:13:18,005 --> 00:13:20,132
and everything in my afterlife
was determined by you.

287
00:13:20,216 --> 00:13:22,760
There is no such thing as free will.

288
00:13:22,843 --> 00:13:24,470
[clears throat]
We're closing up soon, guys.

289
00:13:24,553 --> 00:13:27,097
Yeah. Can we just have 15 minutes?
We're kind of in the middle of something.

290
00:13:27,681 --> 00:13:28,974
I'd take off if I were you.

291
00:13:29,058 --> 00:13:31,560
The second we close,
they use this place to shoot pornos.

292
00:13:33,437 --> 00:13:34,271
Okay.

293
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:36,690
Want something to drink?

294
00:13:36,774 --> 00:13:40,319
Maybe I do, maybe I don't.
But whatever I choose will be the result

295
00:13:40,402 --> 00:13:43,364
of millions of biological,
genetic and societal factors

296
00:13:43,447 --> 00:13:45,699
that are entirely outside my control.

297
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:48,577
Iced tea.

298
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:50,329
Oh, that sounds good.
I'll have one, too.

299
00:13:50,871 --> 00:13:52,998
Okay. You think you have no free will

300
00:13:53,082 --> 00:13:57,336
because I scripted
everything that happened, right?

301
00:13:57,419 --> 00:14:03,300
All I have to do is prove that you made
one choice that I couldn't anticipate.

302
00:14:04,176 --> 00:14:05,135
Easy.

303
00:14:07,137 --> 00:14:09,807
-[phone beeps]
-[loudly] Okay, here's a perfect example.

304
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:11,767
In the very first attempt--

305
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:12,935
Dude, dude, dude.

306
00:14:13,018 --> 00:14:14,645
-What?
-Yelling. You're...

307
00:14:15,437 --> 00:14:17,565
-You're yelling. Like, so loudly.
-Oh.

308
00:14:17,648 --> 00:14:19,066
-Sorry.
-Sorry.

309
00:14:19,149 --> 00:14:19,984
Yeah.

310
00:14:20,776 --> 00:14:23,237
Watch this.
It's from the very first attempt.

311
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:27,783
-[phone beeps]
-If anyone has any information...

312
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:29,577
-Oh, boy.
-...about any of this...

313
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:30,828
Okay, easy.

314
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:32,830
...I beg you, tell me.

315
00:14:33,414 --> 00:14:35,040
Hey. I love you, man.

316
00:14:36,917 --> 00:14:40,254
Michael, the problem
in the neighborhood...

317
00:14:42,047 --> 00:14:42,965
is me.

318
00:14:44,174 --> 00:14:45,759
You saw your friend in pain

319
00:14:45,843 --> 00:14:49,305
and you decided to sacrifice yourself
to help him.

320
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:52,600
That wasn't me pulling a string
or manipulating you.

321
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:57,104
In fact, it was the last thing I wanted.
Ruined my whole plan.

322
00:14:58,272 --> 00:15:00,065
-Free will.
-No, dude.

323
00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:04,278
The only reason
I cared enough about Chidi to do that

324
00:15:04,361 --> 00:15:09,241
was because you forced us together.
Made me feel bad for causing him pain.

325
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:10,326
-Okay, yeah...
-Yeah.

326
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:14,204
...but, no, you were constantly
doing stuff I couldn't anticipate.

327
00:15:14,288 --> 00:15:15,372
As a matter of fact,

328
00:15:15,456 --> 00:15:18,250
I complained to you once
right to your face.

329
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:21,670
-I think it was Reboot 444.
-[phone beeps]

330
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:25,466
Now, is Chidi trapped
in the purple space bubble? Yes.

331
00:15:25,549 --> 00:15:27,635
Is he in pain? Almost certainly.

332
00:15:27,718 --> 00:15:30,554
Will he ever get out? No. However...

333
00:15:30,638 --> 00:15:32,932
Uh, yeah, wrong one. Wrong one.

334
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:37,186
I mean, that's worth watching, it's great,
but not the one I was thinking.

335
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:39,647
-[scoffs]
-It's probably, uh, 445.

336
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:40,648
[phone beeps]

337
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:44,401
[door opens]

338
00:15:45,402 --> 00:15:46,528
You, in here.

339
00:15:50,491 --> 00:15:51,533
Where am I?

340
00:15:52,117 --> 00:15:55,746
Hell. You're in hell.
Can I ask you something?

341
00:15:55,829 --> 00:15:59,708
Have I missed anything
in that freaky little noodle of yours?

342
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:02,211
See, I've studied everything
about your life.

343
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:06,465
I know your hopes, your fears,
your psychology, your tendencies.

344
00:16:07,132 --> 00:16:09,134
I know all your private shames,

345
00:16:09,218 --> 00:16:11,720
like that you don't wash your feet
in the shower,

346
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:14,098
your first concert was Barenaked Ladies

347
00:16:14,181 --> 00:16:19,937
and you had frequent sex dreams
about Sam the Eagle from the Muppets.

348
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:23,023
Well, he's very authoritative
and I find that reassuring.

349
00:16:23,107 --> 00:16:26,819
You keep making crazy choices
I don't understand.

350
00:16:28,737 --> 00:16:29,947
Am I missing something?

351
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:31,740
I'm sorry, can we rewind for a second?

352
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:33,951
Who are you? Who is that guy?

353
00:16:34,034 --> 00:16:35,077
Am I dead?

354
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:38,956
-Is Sam the Eagle here?
-No.

355
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:42,209
-[sighs]
-I tried to script your whole afterlife.

356
00:16:42,292 --> 00:16:46,964
And I devised a 15-million-point plan
to torture you.

357
00:16:47,047 --> 00:16:50,134
You made choices I never saw coming.

358
00:16:50,884 --> 00:16:53,262
I call that free will.

359
00:16:56,515 --> 00:16:58,809
What if all your choices
are predetermined?

360
00:16:58,892 --> 00:17:00,352
You've gotta be kidding me.

361
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:01,520
What? We don't know.

362
00:17:01,603 --> 00:17:04,815
Maybe there's a megademon
who built a torture chamber for demons,

363
00:17:04,898 --> 00:17:06,859
and this whole thing
is just him torturing you.

364
00:17:07,443 --> 00:17:11,864
And maybe all the megademons
are just fulfilling a destiny

365
00:17:11,947 --> 00:17:15,951
laid out by a bunch
of super-intelligent tarantula squids,

366
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:17,619
who are torturing them.

367
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:19,329
[gasping]

368
00:17:23,751 --> 00:17:24,960
Why did you do that?

369
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:27,212
-Because I have free will.
-Ugh.

370
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:30,466
And because you're being so annoying.

371
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:31,800
[Eleanor] Ugh.

372
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:36,221
-Thank you. So sorry that he did that.
-Happens all the time.

373
00:17:36,305 --> 00:17:39,266
Usually, it's the younger woman
doing it to the older guy, though.

374
00:17:40,684 --> 00:17:42,436
Dude, not cool!

375
00:17:42,519 --> 00:17:45,898
Disagree. I think it's the coolest thing
I've ever done.

376
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:49,318
Do you really not see
what's happening here?

377
00:17:49,401 --> 00:17:51,612
Do you want me to spell it out for you?

378
00:17:51,695 --> 00:17:54,740
-This is a defense mechanism, Eleanor.
-[chuckles]

379
00:17:54,823 --> 00:17:57,326
You saw yourself fall in love with Chidi

380
00:17:57,409 --> 00:18:00,954
and it freaked you out
to see yourself be so vulnerable.

381
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:03,707
So, you're using determinism
to convince yourself

382
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:05,626
that those feelings were not real.

383
00:18:05,709 --> 00:18:06,877
You don't know me, man!

384
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:10,839
Yes, I do. I know everything about you.
Remember?

385
00:18:11,465 --> 00:18:15,052
Including that nothing scares you
more than vulnerability.

386
00:18:15,135 --> 00:18:17,179
-Ugh, whatever. Who even cares?
-I do.

387
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:20,849
Because if everything is determined
and we have no free will,

388
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:22,309
then all this stuff we're doing

389
00:18:22,392 --> 00:18:25,145
to put more good into the world
is pointless.

390
00:18:25,979 --> 00:18:27,940
And I want to believe that it matters.

391
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:32,236
So, if you'll excuse me,
I'm gonna use my free will right now

392
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:34,571
to go pick up our friends at the airport.

393
00:18:35,155 --> 00:18:37,533
Worst possible use of free will,

394
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:40,619
but I'm gonna do it anyway,
because I care about them.

395
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,416
You might want to head out, too.

396
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:50,379
We're closing soon, and second we do,
they use this place to shoot porn.

397
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:54,049
[sighs]

398
00:18:56,051 --> 00:18:57,970
First class was amazing!

399
00:18:58,053 --> 00:19:02,099
They give you so many free presents:
a shaving kit, an eye mask, a vest.

400
00:19:04,101 --> 00:19:08,230
At times like this, it's fun to remember
that we're legally married.

401
00:19:08,313 --> 00:19:10,482
[chuckles awkwardly] That is fun.

402
00:19:11,066 --> 00:19:12,359
[Jason] I call window seat!

403
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:21,869
I'm sorry. You were right.

404
00:19:21,952 --> 00:19:24,705
I was scared about what it all meant

405
00:19:24,788 --> 00:19:26,957
and I went back
to one of my favorite moves:

406
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:28,667
turn on the ol' blame hose.

407
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:31,503
"This is all your fault!"

408
00:19:31,587 --> 00:19:35,757
Apology accepted. And I'm sorry
I dumped iced tea on your head.

409
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:36,800
You kidding me?

410
00:19:36,884 --> 00:19:39,553
You did exactly what you should do
when your friend is being annoying.

411
00:19:39,636 --> 00:19:40,762
You snapped me out of it.

412
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:43,015
That's what made me realize,
in a weird way,

413
00:19:43,098 --> 00:19:46,602
{\an8}we're the only truly free beings
in the universe

414
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:49,104
{\an8}because we actually know
what's up with the afterlife.

415
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:52,524
{\an8}And I think that means we need to be bold.

416
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:54,526
{\an8}Take the Soul Squad
to the next level somehow.

417
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:57,070
{\an8}You're right.

418
00:19:58,113 --> 00:20:03,035
{\an8}We need to find someone who can serve
as a blueprint for humanity,

419
00:20:03,118 --> 00:20:06,622
{\an8}someone whose life is so great
that we can use it as a model

420
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:09,374
{\an8}to get as many points
for as many people as possible.

421
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:11,084
{\an8}And I think I know the perfect person.

422
00:20:11,168 --> 00:20:12,294
{\an8}Rihanna. Good call.

423
00:20:12,377 --> 00:20:14,421
{\an8}I don't know her personally,
but I did see her in Vegas once,

424
00:20:14,504 --> 00:20:16,715
and her calf brushed up against my tongue.

425
00:20:17,466 --> 00:20:19,593
I licked her leg.
I was kicked out.

426
00:20:19,676 --> 00:20:22,221
It's not Rihanna.
It's someone way cooler.

427
00:20:22,304 --> 00:20:24,056
Hey, everybody out of the car.

428
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:28,060
Grab your bags.
We're going to rural Canada!

429
00:20:33,398 --> 00:20:34,358
Is it ready?

430
00:20:34,441 --> 00:20:36,735
I guess. We have no idea if it'll work.

431
00:20:36,818 --> 00:20:38,695
Oh, I'm sure it's perfect.

432
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:40,656
Give it a try, Shawn.

433
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:44,243
Me? I'm not going through that thing.
She is.

434
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:48,538
...ask Michael how many times
he rebooted them! He's lying...

435
00:20:48,622 --> 00:20:51,041
Yeah, zip it, toots, we're way past that.

436
00:20:51,124 --> 00:20:53,835
Where am I?
How long was I in there?

437
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:55,879
You have missed a lot.

438
00:20:55,963 --> 00:20:59,174
Now, go through that makeshift portal.
See if you explode.

439
00:21:01,885 --> 00:21:03,470
[laughs] This might be gross!

440
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:10,644
Am I on Earth?

441
00:21:10,727 --> 00:21:14,481
Did you figure out a way
to build an illegal door to Earth?

442
00:21:15,565 --> 00:21:18,735
Yes. That's exactly what I did.

443
00:21:19,236 --> 00:21:21,697
-Well, we all helped.
-Shut up, Glenn.
