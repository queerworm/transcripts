1
00:00:03,169 --> 00:00:05,839
-[Megan] Anything?
-Nope. Nobody knows squat.

2
00:00:05,922 --> 00:00:07,257
What the here is going on?

3
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:09,634
We haven't had any new humans
to torture in a week.

4
00:00:09,718 --> 00:00:11,386
-I miss it.
-I know.

5
00:00:11,469 --> 00:00:14,014
I got so desperate this morning,
I tried flattening an eggplant.

6
00:00:14,097 --> 00:00:15,473
It's just not the same.

7
00:00:15,557 --> 00:00:17,475
Hey! Skin tags. Special meeting.

8
00:00:17,559 --> 00:00:19,185
-About what?
-I don't know.

9
00:00:19,269 --> 00:00:21,813
Probably your dad's stinky sack.

10
00:00:21,896 --> 00:00:23,481
[Steve and Megan laugh]

11
00:00:23,565 --> 00:00:25,567
I hope it's not
more sexual harassment training.

12
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:28,903
We just did that.
And I'm already so good at it.

13
00:00:30,113 --> 00:00:32,490
Whoa! All right! We got 'em.

14
00:00:32,574 --> 00:00:34,325
Okay, here we go! [cackles]

15
00:00:34,409 --> 00:00:37,579
Yeah. Uh, that's not exactly
what's happening here.

16
00:00:37,662 --> 00:00:40,081
The Bad Place is going to be changing,

17
00:00:40,165 --> 00:00:41,207
and I'm...

18
00:00:41,291 --> 00:00:43,293
Well, I'm kind of your boss now.

19
00:00:44,002 --> 00:00:45,920
He's joking, right?

20
00:00:46,004 --> 00:00:47,046
I'm afraid he's not.

21
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:48,423
Things are changing.

22
00:00:48,506 --> 00:00:52,093
Michael and I
are actually going to be wor...

23
00:00:52,177 --> 00:00:53,928
Wor... Wor...

24
00:00:54,554 --> 00:00:55,972
Working... together.

25
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:57,974
Ugh! Oh, I hated that.

26
00:00:58,058 --> 00:01:00,727
I hated saying it, hated how it felt,
hated all of it. Ew!

27
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:02,103
You all have been hand-selected

28
00:01:02,187 --> 00:01:06,524
to be the very first Bad Place architects
who will learn the new system.

29
00:01:06,608 --> 00:01:08,193
Why do we need a new system?

30
00:01:08,276 --> 00:01:10,779
Torture works.
It's the way it's always been done.

31
00:01:10,862 --> 00:01:14,282
With all due respect,
"it's the way it's always been done,"

32
00:01:14,365 --> 00:01:16,910
is an excuse that's been used
for hundreds of years

33
00:01:16,993 --> 00:01:19,954
-to justify racism, misogyny--
-[Steve] Exactly!

34
00:01:20,538 --> 00:01:22,665
See? This chick gets it.

35
00:01:29,422 --> 00:01:31,549
So, these computers have access

36
00:01:31,633 --> 00:01:34,928
{\an8}to every file for every human
currently in the Bad Place.

37
00:01:35,011 --> 00:01:36,513
{\an8}And the three of us
have a very important job.

38
00:01:36,596 --> 00:01:39,808
{\an8}To find out which former US presidents
were secretly gay.

39
00:01:39,891 --> 00:01:41,518
{\an8}-No.
-Okay, fine. Bi.

40
00:01:41,601 --> 00:01:43,102
{\an8}Sure, but also,

41
00:01:43,186 --> 00:01:45,104
{\an8}while Michael is trying
to get the architects trained,

42
00:01:45,188 --> 00:01:48,233
{\an8}we're supposed to find
the first 1,000 humans to take the test.

43
00:01:48,316 --> 00:01:52,445
{\an8}People who'll just sail right through it,
so we can build confidence in the system.

44
00:01:52,529 --> 00:01:53,404
{\an8}So, what are the criteria?

45
00:01:53,488 --> 00:01:56,074
{\an8}Should it be people
with the highest point totals,

46
00:01:56,157 --> 00:01:58,076
{\an8}or overcame the greatest hardship?

47
00:01:58,159 --> 00:01:59,369
{\an8}I think we just start with the gimmes.

48
00:01:59,452 --> 00:02:01,454
{\an8}The very best people who ever lived, so...

49
00:02:02,038 --> 00:02:04,833
{\an8}Evel Knievel, Kool-Aid Man, Mini-Me,

50
00:02:04,916 --> 00:02:08,545
{\an8}DJ Jazzy Jeff... [gasps] A genie
so we could wish for infinity people...

51
00:02:08,628 --> 00:02:10,088
{\an8}-Jason--
-Sure, throw me in there, too.

52
00:02:10,171 --> 00:02:13,091
{\an8}Also, Fat Bastard,
The World's Most Interesting Man,

53
00:02:13,174 --> 00:02:15,093
{\an8}Pikachu, Karate Kid,

54
00:02:15,176 --> 00:02:16,761
{\an8}Wendy from Wendy's, Grumpy Cat,

55
00:02:16,845 --> 00:02:19,514
{\an8}and the GPS lady
that tells you where to drive,.

56
00:02:20,014 --> 00:02:21,683
{\an8}[sighs]
Feels like a good stopping point.

57
00:02:21,766 --> 00:02:23,726
{\an8}Let's call it a day.
Come back fresh tomorrow.

58
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:25,687
{\an8}-Great job, everyone!
-What--

59
00:02:28,773 --> 00:02:33,153
{\an8}[Michael] Okay. Janet's passing out
the file on Tahani Al-Jamil,

60
00:02:33,236 --> 00:02:35,655
{\an8}who volunteered
to be today's test subject.

61
00:02:35,738 --> 00:02:37,866
{\an8}So, take a look and then we'll get going.

62
00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:39,325
{\an8}[Tahani] They don't seem very enthused.

63
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:41,369
{\an8}This may be a tougher challenge
than I thought.

64
00:02:41,452 --> 00:02:44,205
{\an8}Like when I tried to teach
Taylor Swift how to dance.

65
00:02:44,747 --> 00:02:46,416
{\an8}The longest four years of my life.

66
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:49,669
{\an8}We're uprooting
the entire Bad Place system,

67
00:02:49,752 --> 00:02:52,046
{\an8}and these architects
are set in their ways.

68
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:54,132
{\an8}It's gonna take a lot of work.

69
00:02:54,215 --> 00:02:57,010
But the work is the fun part, guys.

70
00:02:57,093 --> 00:02:58,845
So, no matter how long it takes,

71
00:02:58,928 --> 00:03:03,141
we'll see it through
and usher in a better, brighter future.

72
00:03:03,224 --> 00:03:06,311
Screw this.
I'm not working for a traitor.

73
00:03:06,394 --> 00:03:07,729
Phil out.

74
00:03:07,812 --> 00:03:09,397
That's my name, Phil.

75
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,482
Oh, Phil. Hey. Come on, buddy.

76
00:03:11,566 --> 00:03:13,067
I personally chose you

77
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:16,779
based on your innovative work in the
Performative Wokeness department.

78
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:17,864
Wow.

79
00:03:17,947 --> 00:03:20,074
Way to mansplain my own department to me.

80
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:21,910
And I'm triggered.

81
00:03:21,993 --> 00:03:22,952
[laughs]

82
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:25,622
Oh, man! What a legend!

83
00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:28,124
-Ooh. Who you reading about?
-Me.

84
00:03:28,207 --> 00:03:29,417
I ruled on Earth.

85
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,961
I siphoned so much gas, Eleanor.

86
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:34,088
Even if the car was moving,

87
00:03:34,172 --> 00:03:36,591
or on fire, or a boat,

88
00:03:36,674 --> 00:03:38,092
I still always got that gas.

89
00:03:38,176 --> 00:03:39,260
Oh, man.

90
00:03:39,344 --> 00:03:42,430
I never thought about the fact
that we could look up our own files.

91
00:03:42,513 --> 00:03:44,057
Yeah. I printed out all of ours.

92
00:03:47,393 --> 00:03:49,270
-I love you, okay?
-Oh.

93
00:03:49,354 --> 00:03:50,980
The words are nice, but the tone is scary.

94
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:54,275
We're in love, and everything's great,
and if we wanna keep it that way,

95
00:03:54,359 --> 00:03:57,362
you have to promise
to never, ever, ever read my file.

96
00:03:57,445 --> 00:04:00,406
Okay, if you don't want me to,
then of course I won't,

97
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:02,492
but nothing in there could ever change
how I feel about you.

98
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:07,288
Eh. You say that now, but you don't know
what I did on Halloween 2013.

99
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:09,123
What did you do on Halloween 2013?

100
00:04:09,207 --> 00:04:11,251
Oh, I don't remember,
but it must've been bad.

101
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:14,420
Because the next morning, I woke up
in a large Rubbermaid container

102
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:15,713
in some family's basement,

103
00:04:15,797 --> 00:04:17,799
and I'd barfed
all over their old photo albums.

104
00:04:18,883 --> 00:04:21,636
Yeah, see? That's the look
we're trying to avoid here, bud.

105
00:04:21,719 --> 00:04:23,346
I don't need to read your file.

106
00:04:23,429 --> 00:04:25,014
I know you.

107
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:28,643
And I love you, and I can't wait
to spend eternity with you.

108
00:04:30,186 --> 00:04:33,982
I mean, obviously,
we have a lot of work to do here,

109
00:04:34,065 --> 00:04:35,483
and then we both have to pass the test.

110
00:04:35,566 --> 00:04:37,277
But, eventually,
we're gonna be together forever.

111
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,319
You have to read my file right now.

112
00:04:38,403 --> 00:04:40,780
What? I'm confused. Is this a game?

113
00:04:41,823 --> 00:04:43,533
Is it a sex game, somehow?

114
00:04:43,616 --> 00:04:44,784
I can't risk it.

115
00:04:44,867 --> 00:04:47,370
What if we spend
half of eternity together,

116
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:50,540
and then, you find out something
that does change the way you feel about me

117
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:54,335
and then you resent me
for wasting half your eternity?

118
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:56,713
No. It's better we just rip
the Band-Aid off

119
00:04:56,796 --> 00:04:59,507
and you read about all the bad stuff now,
when we're hot and heavy.

120
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:01,801
-Okay. I'll read your file.
-Yeah.

121
00:05:01,884 --> 00:05:03,886
Can I finish reading
about Oskar Schindler first?

122
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:08,891
{\an8}That's who I gotta follow? The list guy?
You and I are so screwed, dude.

Is this movie finally over?

134
00:05:33,791 --> 00:05:35,543
-It's basically over. Just one little--

-Okay. So, thoughts?

138
00:05:47,263 --> 00:05:50,224
Yeah. This all sounds so lame.

139
00:05:50,308 --> 00:05:53,061
No, it's the current system that's lame.

140
00:05:53,144 --> 00:05:54,312
It's so basic.

141
00:05:54,395 --> 00:05:56,230
You get a human's file,

142
00:05:56,314 --> 00:05:57,940
and let's be honest,
you never even read it.

143
00:05:58,024 --> 00:06:00,735
You just skip
to the "fears and phobias" section

144
00:06:00,818 --> 00:06:01,944
and use that to torture them.

145
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:04,447
Fear of snakes? Throw 'em in a snake pit.

146
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:08,034
Worried something's gonna happen
to your normal, cylindrical penis?

147
00:06:08,117 --> 00:06:08,951
Flatten it.

148
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:10,620
This new way allows you

149
00:06:10,703 --> 00:06:14,457
to test their specific psychological flaws
and weaknesses.

150
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:16,876
And trust us, they have plenty.

151
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:19,337
-Hey!
-Sorry. I'm in selling mode.

152
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:22,632
Guys, this is your chance
to be part of a bold, new future.

153
00:06:22,715 --> 00:06:25,718
Are you telling me
there's not one single demon

154
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:30,139
who wants to design the very first
sample test of this new system?

155
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:31,724
Oh, there is.

156
00:06:31,808 --> 00:06:34,185
And she's a stone-cold fox.

157
00:06:37,313 --> 00:06:38,898
Vicky, what are you doing here?

158
00:06:38,981 --> 00:06:43,069
Relax. I heard about the new system.
I love it, and I wanna be a part of it.

159
00:06:43,152 --> 00:06:45,363
Forgive me if I'm a little skeptical,

160
00:06:45,446 --> 00:06:49,075
given that you did once try to sabotage
my entire neighborhood.

161
00:06:49,158 --> 00:06:50,701
Look. After you blew me into goo,

162
00:06:50,785 --> 00:06:53,287
I had a lot of time to think
while my goo was reforming.

163
00:06:53,371 --> 00:06:57,083
If things are gonna change,
then I have to change along with them.

164
00:06:57,166 --> 00:07:01,504
And sure, change can be scary,
but... I'm an artist,

165
00:07:01,587 --> 00:07:04,841
which means, it's my job to be scared.

166
00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:07,135
-[scoffs]
-[Michael] All right, fine, take a seat.

167
00:07:07,218 --> 00:07:09,095
Janet'll give you Tahani's file.

168
00:07:09,178 --> 00:07:10,471
Oh, no. I don't need her file.

169
00:07:10,555 --> 00:07:12,306
I know Tahani very well.

170
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:15,893
Self-obsessed, family issues,
way too into being tall.

171
00:07:15,977 --> 00:07:17,812
[Tahani] Typical Vicky, throwing shade.

172
00:07:17,895 --> 00:07:20,606
But it doesn't matter,
'cause I'm casting it.

173
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:23,317
Because I'm closer to the sun.

174
00:07:24,527 --> 00:07:25,361
I'm tall.

175
00:07:28,406 --> 00:07:30,700
Oh, no. I knew it.
You hate me now.

176
00:07:30,783 --> 00:07:33,619
What did it? That time I was subpoenaed
by the Make-A-Wish Foundation?

177
00:07:33,703 --> 00:07:35,997
-No.
-Oh, I know what it was.

178
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:39,000
In my defense, I didn't realize
he was my boyfriend's twin

179
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:40,585
until halfway into hooking up with him,

180
00:07:40,668 --> 00:07:43,296
and at that point, you know,
it's a sunk cost.

181
00:07:43,379 --> 00:07:44,255
[Chidi] I don't hate you at all.

182
00:07:44,338 --> 00:07:46,215
I mean, you were dealt
a pretty tough hand.

183
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:48,217
You essentially had to raise yourself,

184
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:52,472
but you were still more confident
and self-possessed at 13 than I ever was.

185
00:07:52,555 --> 00:07:56,434
I mean, seeing your whole life
all laid out like this, it's...

186
00:07:57,643 --> 00:07:58,478
It's remarkable.

187
00:07:59,061 --> 00:08:01,105
Okay, so you still love me.

188
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:03,983
You're still horny for me,
blah, blah, blah...

189
00:08:04,066 --> 00:08:05,276
Then, what's wrong?

190
00:08:05,359 --> 00:08:07,028
I'm not good enough for you!

191
00:08:07,111 --> 00:08:08,696
I mean... Look at my file.

192
00:08:08,779 --> 00:08:13,451
It is one-tenth as long as yours,
because I did nothing with my life.

193
00:08:13,534 --> 00:08:16,162
Yeah, we're very different,
but we already knew that.

194
00:08:16,245 --> 00:08:17,663
-Why are you freaking out?
-[sighs]

195
00:08:17,747 --> 00:08:19,749
You're cool, confident Chidi now,
remember?

196
00:08:19,832 --> 00:08:21,918
I am confident about my feelings for you.

197
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:25,713
I am also confident that I am a damn drip,

198
00:08:25,796 --> 00:08:28,007
and you deserve to be with someone
who's not.

199
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:31,177
Like Nicolas, that fireman
that you dated back in 2009?

200
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:34,805
He rescued people from burning buildings,
and he was so hot!

201
00:08:34,889 --> 00:08:37,934
Oh, Nicolas the fireman...

202
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:39,435
Mmm.

203
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,354
Nicolas.

204
00:08:41,437 --> 00:08:44,190
[inhales sharply]
I can't argue with you on that one, but...

205
00:08:44,649 --> 00:08:45,942
I love you.

206
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:48,653
There's no one else I wanna be with.

207
00:08:48,736 --> 00:08:50,279
At least, not forever.

208
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:52,990
I mean, if Frida Kahlo
wants to make out with me in heaven

209
00:08:53,074 --> 00:08:54,575
then you and I
are gonna have a conversation,

210
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:59,121
but if you read my file and you're good,
then we're good.

211
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:01,916
Unless there's something in your file
that would freak me out,

212
00:09:01,999 --> 00:09:04,126
like you kept out a library book
past the due date. [laughs]

213
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:05,461
What-- I moved!

214
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:07,004
It got buried in the bottom of a box.

215
00:09:07,088 --> 00:09:08,548
I put the library in my will
to make up for it.

216
00:09:08,631 --> 00:09:09,674
No, I'm kidding. I'm kidding.

217
00:09:09,757 --> 00:09:10,883
Relax.

218
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:12,260
Let's get back to work.

219
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:17,056
Now, when I press this lever,

220
00:09:17,139 --> 00:09:21,018
Tahani will enter the scenario
that Megan has designed

221
00:09:21,102 --> 00:09:23,479
that will test
her ethical decision-making.

222
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:27,191
Obviously, in the real test, the humans
won't know they're being tested,

223
00:09:27,275 --> 00:09:29,735
but this should be a good practice run.

224
00:09:30,319 --> 00:09:31,153
Everyone ready?

225
00:09:35,658 --> 00:09:36,659
Hors d'oeuvre?

226
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:38,953
Why, yes. Thank you.

227
00:09:39,036 --> 00:09:40,705
-[chainsaws whirring]
-Chainsaw bear!

228
00:09:43,124 --> 00:09:45,042
Okay, so, couple of things.

229
00:09:45,126 --> 00:09:48,462
We're not using chainsaw bears anymore,
remember?

230
00:09:48,546 --> 00:09:50,840
Right. Okay. Yeah.

231
00:09:50,923 --> 00:09:53,259
-What else?
-It was mainly that one thing.

232
00:09:53,342 --> 00:09:55,094
Why don't you try again?

233
00:09:55,177 --> 00:09:58,514
And remember that the challenges
your test subject faces

234
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:01,183
should be smaller and more relatable.

235
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:02,852
Okay.

236
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:05,980
Hors d'oeuvre? It's salmon crudités.

237
00:10:06,063 --> 00:10:07,440
Is it farm-raised salmon?

238
00:10:07,523 --> 00:10:09,775
'Cause I prefer
to support sustainable fishing.

239
00:10:09,859 --> 00:10:12,278
{\an8}[clears throat] Mondays, am I right?

240
00:10:12,361 --> 00:10:13,237
{\an8}-[chainsaws whirring]
-Chainsaw!

241
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:16,365
[Megan] You said "smaller
and more relatable."

242
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:20,119
The bear is smaller, humans hate Mondays
and love bacon.

243
00:10:20,202 --> 00:10:21,454
What do you want from me?

244
00:10:21,537 --> 00:10:23,623
[Vicky] Michael, can I try?

245
00:10:23,706 --> 00:10:25,041
I can show them what you're trying to do.

246
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:27,460
Fine, Vicky, go ahead.

247
00:10:28,336 --> 00:10:31,756
Now, first, I need to
get into Tahani's headspace.

248
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:32,882
[in English accent] Hello, love.

249
00:10:32,965 --> 00:10:35,134
Pish-posh, tuna and pickles.

250
00:10:35,217 --> 00:10:39,639
I once played billiards with
Questlove and Olivia Munn.

251
00:10:39,722 --> 00:10:40,765
[in normal voice] Yeah, there she is.

252
00:10:40,848 --> 00:10:42,642
Okay, just give me a second.
[clears throat]

253
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:44,518
Ooh. [sighs]

254
00:10:44,602 --> 00:10:47,438
Just finished reading up
about James Buchanan.

255
00:10:47,938 --> 00:10:52,109
Definitely at least a little bi.
I'm gonna put him in the maybe pile.

256
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:56,030
[grunts softly]
I want nachos. Is there a snack bar here?

257
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:58,866
What's going on, dawg?

258
00:10:58,949 --> 00:11:00,368
I know you're upset. You have a tell.

259
00:11:00,951 --> 00:11:01,869
-I do?
-Yeah.

260
00:11:01,952 --> 00:11:04,121
You told Eleanor before
that you were upset,

261
00:11:04,205 --> 00:11:05,373
and I think you still are.

262
00:11:05,456 --> 00:11:09,543
[sighs] Looking at Eleanor's life
made me realize how different we are.

263
00:11:09,627 --> 00:11:12,088
If the system works,
and we both pass our tests,

264
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:16,342
I don't see any version of eternity
where she doesn't get bored of me.

265
00:11:16,425 --> 00:11:19,178
I mean, my fake heaven
was a 600 square-foot apartment

266
00:11:19,261 --> 00:11:23,265
that was essentially a bookcase
and a toilet... and I loved it.

267
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:26,310
So what? It's cool that you guys
are so different.

268
00:11:26,394 --> 00:11:28,687
Sometimes, two people
who have nothing in common

269
00:11:28,771 --> 00:11:31,732
get together, and it rules.
Opposites attract.

270
00:11:31,816 --> 00:11:34,193
Well, you need that to be true
because you're dating Janet.

271
00:11:34,276 --> 00:11:35,403
[chuckles]

272
00:11:35,486 --> 00:11:36,904
Ultimate opposites.

273
00:11:37,488 --> 00:11:41,492
So, what, are you saying...
Janet might get bored of me?

274
00:11:41,575 --> 00:11:43,828
No, that's not... I'm sorry.
I didn't mean...

275
00:11:43,911 --> 00:11:45,663
Man... Oh, no.

276
00:11:45,746 --> 00:11:47,456
No, Jason. Come back, I...

277
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:50,042
[groans]

278
00:11:50,626 --> 00:11:52,753
I wish I were back in my toilet library.

279
00:11:53,254 --> 00:11:58,008
And places, and... action.

280
00:12:01,178 --> 00:12:04,098
Can you believe we're still having
this dinner for Kamilah?

281
00:12:04,181 --> 00:12:05,683
So embarrassing.

282
00:12:05,766 --> 00:12:06,976
[Georges] She doesn't know this yet,

283
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:09,979
but I heard that the reviews for
her new album are going to be dreadful.

284
00:12:10,062 --> 00:12:12,565
The rumor is that the label
is going to drop her.

285
00:12:12,648 --> 00:12:16,485
I heard she may have to fly home coach
and "check a bag,"

286
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:17,778
-whatever that means.
-[both chuckle]

287
00:12:17,862 --> 00:12:19,613
-[glass clinking]
-[Manisha] Thank you, everyone,

288
00:12:19,697 --> 00:12:22,616
for coming
to celebrate our daughter Kamilah.

289
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:25,244
I know you're all very busy these days.

290
00:12:25,327 --> 00:12:27,246
Just look at our other daughter, Tahani.

291
00:12:27,329 --> 00:12:28,998
She had to come straight from the gym.
[laughs]

292
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:32,460
Would anyone like to say
a few words of praise

293
00:12:32,543 --> 00:12:36,464
about Kamilah's latest album,
or any other aspect of Kamilah?

294
00:12:36,547 --> 00:12:38,716
There are so many to celebrate.

295
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:40,593
[Kamilah] Perhaps Tahani should speak.

296
00:12:40,676 --> 00:12:45,222
She's had her share of failures recently.
Celebrating me could be therapeutic.

297
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:48,893
Certainly. I can say something...

298
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:51,937
but I have no idea what.

299
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:54,648
Goodness, this is hard.

300
00:12:57,234 --> 00:13:00,488
Well done, Vicky.
That was quite good... for the system.

301
00:13:00,571 --> 00:13:02,072
For me, it was rather traumatic.

302
00:13:02,156 --> 00:13:04,658
Okay. It's like her parents
were the chainsaw bear,

303
00:13:04,742 --> 00:13:08,370
but instead of chopping off her head,
they chopped off her self-esteem?

304
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:10,122
Yes! Megan, good.

305
00:13:10,206 --> 00:13:11,624
Take what you know about them,

306
00:13:11,707 --> 00:13:14,168
and then force them
into moments of personal difficulty.

307
00:13:14,251 --> 00:13:18,255
Think of it as, flattening the penises
of their heart.

308
00:13:18,339 --> 00:13:20,674
Oh! Now it makes sense.

309
00:13:20,758 --> 00:13:24,220
Why don't you go deeper into her file
and look for other ways to challenge her?

310
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:25,429
No. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

311
00:13:25,513 --> 00:13:27,056
Slow down. Slow down, here.

312
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:29,099
Vicky's example was fine.

313
00:13:29,183 --> 00:13:31,185
There was some good stuff there.

314
00:13:31,268 --> 00:13:35,356
But overall... uh, C-plus.
It was a C-plus, I'd say.

315
00:13:35,439 --> 00:13:36,857
There's some problems with it.

316
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:39,485
Some technical issues that only I can see
and everything,

317
00:13:39,568 --> 00:13:42,154
so, basically, it actually kinda stunk.

318
00:13:42,238 --> 00:13:44,782
So, I think it's just best
if you leave, Vicky.

319
00:13:44,865 --> 00:13:46,742
This is not working. You're bad at this.

320
00:13:46,825 --> 00:13:48,494
C-plus. Okay, goodbye.

321
00:13:48,577 --> 00:13:52,039
Wow. Same old Michael,
just can't share the spotlight.

322
00:13:52,122 --> 00:13:53,624
Well, goodbye, everyone.

323
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:55,376
That's a wrap on Vicky.

324
00:14:00,381 --> 00:14:02,383
[Janet] Michael, why did you fire Vicky?

325
00:14:02,466 --> 00:14:05,511
Look, I know she did well
on the first test.

326
00:14:05,594 --> 00:14:08,764
But it's beginners' luck.
There's an X factor here.

327
00:14:08,847 --> 00:14:12,560
Uh, a secret sauce that only I truly know
how to...

328
00:14:13,435 --> 00:14:17,273
pour over the juicy steak of this process.

329
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:19,608
I've never said this before, but... what?

330
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:21,443
[Tahani] Not only is Vicky good
at test design,

331
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:23,028
but she's good at teaching the others.

332
00:14:23,112 --> 00:14:25,114
Well, that's the problem.
She's moving too fast.

333
00:14:25,197 --> 00:14:27,199
We have to learn how to walk
before we can run.

334
00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:29,952
So first you thought it would take
forever, and now it's moving too fast.

335
00:14:30,035 --> 00:14:31,954
First of all, you know, uh, shut up.

336
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:34,081
And second of all, just shut up.

337
00:14:34,164 --> 00:14:36,375
-[gasps]
-It's obvious what's going on here.

338
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:39,837
You don't want your nemesis
to be the one to solve your problem.

339
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:40,754
I know that feeling.

340
00:14:40,838 --> 00:14:43,966
Once on Earth, I didn't know something,
and I had to ask Alexa.

341
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:45,551
I felt dirty.

342
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:48,804
No, that's not it.

343
00:14:51,223 --> 00:14:55,436
I'm upset, because for hundreds of years,
I've had a job.

344
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:58,814
First, it was finding a better way
to torture humans,

345
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:02,693
then helping them,
then proving the system was broken,

346
00:15:02,776 --> 00:15:04,278
then teaching the demons.

347
00:15:04,361 --> 00:15:08,490
I had to roll a rock up a hill,
over and over.

348
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:11,493
And then it kept rolling down,
so I had to do it again.

349
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:14,038
And then Vicky comes along with this...

350
00:15:14,955 --> 00:15:19,877
like, rock-lifter thing,
and just lifts it to the top of the hill.

351
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:22,755
Pushing the rock up the hill
gave me a purpose.

352
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:24,590
Who am I...

353
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:27,801
if the rock's gone?

354
00:15:28,719 --> 00:15:31,513
Ironically, that's exactly
what Vin Diesel asked me

355
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:34,683
when Dwayne Johnson refused to appear
in <i>Fast &amp; Furious 9.</i>

356
00:15:35,684 --> 00:15:38,103
Not helpful? Copy that.

357
00:15:38,812 --> 00:15:42,232
Honestly, Michael, I don't know
what's to become of you,

358
00:15:42,316 --> 00:15:43,609
or any of us.

359
00:15:43,692 --> 00:15:47,321
But getting Vicky back is the best chance
to make your plan work now.

360
00:15:47,404 --> 00:15:51,241
So focus on that,
and deal with the future in the future.

361
00:15:53,243 --> 00:15:54,078
Hey...

362
00:15:54,578 --> 00:15:55,412
Um...

363
00:15:56,997 --> 00:16:00,417
I'm sorry I said that before, man.

364
00:16:00,501 --> 00:16:02,544
No, you were right.

365
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:06,715
Janet and I are different.
Maybe it can't last.

366
00:16:07,216 --> 00:16:09,551
Maybe we're like
the Montagues and Capulets.

367
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:10,678
How do you know that?

368
00:16:10,761 --> 00:16:14,014
I read some books, man! Jeez.

369
00:16:14,098 --> 00:16:15,683
[sighs] All right, listen.

370
00:16:17,226 --> 00:16:20,020
Maybe on paper,
you and Janet don't make total sense,

371
00:16:20,104 --> 00:16:21,021
but who cares?

372
00:16:21,105 --> 00:16:24,608
The relationship you have built together
is wonderful.

373
00:16:24,692 --> 00:16:27,987
She knows you and loves you,
and that's all that matters.

374
00:16:28,904 --> 00:16:30,990
-Do you really believe that?
-Of course I do.

375
00:16:31,073 --> 00:16:33,283
[laughs] Sucker!

376
00:16:34,576 --> 00:16:36,996
-Sorry?
-I got you so bad.

377
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:40,916
Dude, pretend what you just said
was what you said to you instead of to me.

378
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,793
And you have to listen to yourself,

379
00:16:42,876 --> 00:16:45,629
because it was already in your own head,
and then came out.

380
00:16:45,713 --> 00:16:47,423
But just put it back in your head,

381
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:52,219
and realize that it was you
talking about you and Eleanor.

382
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:59,018
Against all odds, I know what you mean,
and I gotta give it up. That was...

383
00:16:59,643 --> 00:17:01,562
-That was good.
-Yeah, it was.

384
00:17:01,645 --> 00:17:03,480
Chess-mate.

385
00:17:03,564 --> 00:17:07,568
[laughing]

386
00:17:09,069 --> 00:17:09,987
Hey!

387
00:17:10,571 --> 00:17:11,447
There she is.

388
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:15,826
-Where are you off to?
-I have an ice-cold yoga class.

389
00:17:15,909 --> 00:17:18,579
-It's amazing. You pull so many muscles.
-Yeah.

390
00:17:19,288 --> 00:17:20,164
What do you want?

391
00:17:20,247 --> 00:17:21,290
[sighs]

392
00:17:21,373 --> 00:17:23,500
I'm sorry that I kicked you out.

393
00:17:23,584 --> 00:17:25,210
It wasn't about you.

394
00:17:25,294 --> 00:17:28,130
It was just my own insecurities
getting in the way.

395
00:17:29,089 --> 00:17:30,382
Will you please come back?

396
00:17:31,216 --> 00:17:32,259
No.

397
00:17:32,342 --> 00:17:35,054
I'm not gonna let myself
be degraded by you again.

398
00:17:35,137 --> 00:17:37,931
I am a strong, independent acid snake

399
00:17:38,015 --> 00:17:40,768
in the skinsuit
of a strong, independent woman.

400
00:17:40,851 --> 00:17:41,810
Listen, listen, listen.
Uh...

401
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:46,440
You were the best part
of my original neighborhood.

402
00:17:46,523 --> 00:17:48,984
I took you for granted,
and that was wrong.

403
00:17:49,943 --> 00:17:52,821
But now, I want to give you
the role of a lifetime.

404
00:17:53,655 --> 00:17:56,408
You're going to run the whole project.

405
00:17:56,492 --> 00:17:58,994
I'll give you all my plans and my notes,

406
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:01,705
but then I'll step back
and you'll take over.

407
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:04,124
Full creative control...

408
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:05,751
like a director.

409
00:18:06,335 --> 00:18:08,212
-What do you say?
-Well, um...

410
00:18:09,213 --> 00:18:10,047
It sounds great.

411
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:11,256
But it won't work.

412
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:13,175
Everyone here hates you so much,

413
00:18:13,258 --> 00:18:15,928
if you just put me in control,
they'll think I'm your puppet.

414
00:18:16,011 --> 00:18:18,263
I can't have any of your
dingleberry stank on me.

415
00:18:18,347 --> 00:18:21,850
I know.
That's why I'm not giving it to you.

416
00:18:22,726 --> 00:18:24,103
You're going to take it.

417
00:18:25,562 --> 00:18:26,730
[Chidi] Hey.

418
00:18:26,814 --> 00:18:33,529
So, uh, I was being stupid,
and Jason gave me some really good advice.

419
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:34,863
[chuckles] Classic us.

420
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:40,702
Look, who we were on Earth
is a tiny part of who we are,

421
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:43,622
and an even smaller part
of who we are together.

422
00:18:43,705 --> 00:18:45,874
So, I'm sorry for freaking out.

423
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:48,502
But also,
someday, when we get to the Good Place,

424
00:18:48,585 --> 00:18:51,380
I'm gonna learn to play the guitar
so you don't get bored of me.

425
00:18:52,172 --> 00:18:53,507
I actually prefer drummers.

426
00:18:54,508 --> 00:18:55,676
Read my file.

427
00:18:58,178 --> 00:18:59,346
Sorry for the delay.

428
00:18:59,429 --> 00:19:01,723
Now, for this next phase of the training--

429
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:05,018
-Stop right there.
-Vicky? I thought I got rid of you.

430
00:19:05,102 --> 00:19:08,105
And now you're coming
through the door unexpectedly?

431
00:19:08,188 --> 00:19:10,440
That's right. I'm launching a coup.

432
00:19:10,524 --> 00:19:14,069
My, my, my, we've got some history,
don't we?

433
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:16,530
But I'm still standing, Mikey-boy.

434
00:19:16,613 --> 00:19:18,907
And right now, I'm taking over.

435
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:21,952
Explain what you mean,
for me and everyone else.

436
00:19:22,035 --> 00:19:24,246
Oh, this is my training now. You're done.

437
00:19:24,329 --> 00:19:26,874
And all of these demons are behind me,
right, guys?

438
00:19:26,957 --> 00:19:30,919
-[demons agreeing]
-All right, Vicky. You win... this time.

439
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:32,671
-Tahani, Janet, let's go.
-[Janet] Huh.

440
00:19:32,754 --> 00:19:35,507
Well, no, but wait...
Wait, we're still fighting.

441
00:19:35,591 --> 00:19:39,261
And it's so heated
that, um, it might just erupt into...

442
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:42,347
the dance battle from <i>West Side Story?</i>

443
00:19:42,931 --> 00:19:45,225
No, I'm too upset about the coup thing.

444
00:19:45,809 --> 00:19:48,103
Hurry up. Before she starts singing.

445
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:52,733
{\an8}[Vicky] Welcome! Welcome, everyone!
Come on in.

446
00:19:52,816 --> 00:19:56,445
Good Place architects to my left,
Bad Place architects to my right.

447
00:19:56,528 --> 00:20:01,325
Get your files and orientation packets.
Classes begin in 30 minutes.

448
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:08,457
Oh, also, my Movement
for Lava Monsters class is now full.

449
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:10,375
Aw, man!

450
00:20:11,251 --> 00:20:14,713
You got the rock up the hill,
and it looks like it's gonna stay there.

451
00:20:15,422 --> 00:20:16,924
Now, we just have to find your next rock.

452
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:20,385
Well, the first bunch of neighborhoods
is up and running.

453
00:20:20,969 --> 00:20:22,137
What now?

454
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:24,806
That's the sound
when someone gets into the Good Place.

455
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:27,226
Who was it? Prince? It's gotta be Prince.

456
00:20:27,309 --> 00:20:28,810
Honestly, if it wasn't Prince,

457
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:30,437
this whole thing is screwed up
and we gotta start over.

458
00:20:31,021 --> 00:20:33,565
No. It's you guys.

459
00:20:34,775 --> 00:20:35,609
For real?

460
00:20:35,692 --> 00:20:39,279
The Judge agreed that the four of you
don't need to take the test.

461
00:20:39,363 --> 00:20:42,741
Turns out that saving every soul
in the universe

462
00:20:42,824 --> 00:20:44,409
is worth a few points.

463
00:20:44,493 --> 00:20:47,663
-You're in.
-[all laughing and cheering]

464
00:20:54,753 --> 00:20:57,297
{\an8}No, I know. I know. It's real this time.

465
00:20:57,381 --> 00:20:58,215
{\an8}I promise.

466
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:01,134
{\an8}Get in.

467
00:21:01,969 --> 00:21:02,970
{\an8}Are you coming, too?

468
00:21:03,053 --> 00:21:04,805
{\an8}Yeah. I figured I would.

469
00:21:05,555 --> 00:21:08,976
{\an8}Recently unemployed. Might as well
do some traveling. [chuckles]

470
00:21:09,059 --> 00:21:09,893
{\an8}Shall we?

471
00:21:14,147 --> 00:21:15,649
{\an8}-[Eleanor sighs]
-[Chidi] Whoa!

472
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:22,197
[Jason] Foles!
