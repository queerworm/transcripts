1
00:00:01,584 --> 00:00:04,838
As you reach the end of your first year
in the afterlife...

2
00:00:04,921 --> 00:00:06,673
<i>what do you remember most? </i>

3
00:00:06,756 --> 00:00:08,883
<i>The everlasting friendships you made?</i>

4
00:00:08,967 --> 00:00:11,761
<i>The adversity you overcame together?</i>

5
00:00:11,845 --> 00:00:14,055
<i>The day everything was chocolate?</i>

6
00:00:14,139 --> 00:00:15,682
That day was awesome.

7
00:00:15,765 --> 00:00:19,227
I had a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup.
It was all chocolate.

8
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:20,145
[shushing]

9
00:00:20,228 --> 00:00:22,647
[Eleanor]<i> You only have a few hours left</i>
<i>in your first year,</i>

10
00:00:22,731 --> 00:00:26,192
<i>so why not do as many amazing good deeds</i>
<i>for other people</i>

11
00:00:26,276 --> 00:00:29,404
<i>as you possibly can by midnight?</i>
<i>Just in case.</i>

12
00:00:29,487 --> 00:00:30,739
[sighs]

13
00:00:30,822 --> 00:00:32,657
I know. I know. I'll take it out.

14
00:00:32,741 --> 00:00:34,659
I'm a little tired, okay? Lay off.

15
00:00:34,743 --> 00:00:38,955
That movie, minus the part where Eleanor
gives away the entire experiment,

16
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:40,999
will play before the party tonight.

17
00:00:41,082 --> 00:00:44,544
Speaking of which, the theme is
One Year Down, Infinity to Go.

18
00:00:44,627 --> 00:00:46,629
Dress is London black tie.

19
00:00:46,713 --> 00:00:50,091
That means Knightsbridge black tie,
not Kensington.

20
00:00:50,175 --> 00:00:53,970
Or heaven forbid West Brompton. [laughing]

21
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:56,097
Can you imagine? [laughing]

22
00:00:56,181 --> 00:00:57,265
[chuckling] No.

23
00:00:57,348 --> 00:01:00,602
Also, just after midnight,
in order to reset my processing power,

24
00:01:00,685 --> 00:01:04,064
I will be violently eating
my Janet babies.

25
00:01:04,147 --> 00:01:05,940
I'd advise no one look directly at me.

26
00:01:06,024 --> 00:01:10,278
Copy that. So, tonight at the party,
we're going for one more point grab.

27
00:01:10,361 --> 00:01:12,655
I'm gonna suggest they make
toasts about each other,

28
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:16,034
celebrate their ups and downs,
demonstrate personal growth,

29
00:01:16,117 --> 00:01:18,703
blah, blah, blah, humanity is saved!

30
00:01:18,787 --> 00:01:20,038
[all chuckling]

31
00:01:20,121 --> 00:01:22,957
One more day, guys. Let's finish strong.

32
00:01:23,041 --> 00:01:27,545
And to that end, as you might know,
I've been practicing human magic.

33
00:01:27,629 --> 00:01:28,505
Oh!

34
00:01:30,048 --> 00:01:31,674
-Ta-da!
-[Jason] Dope.

35
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:33,593
[Michael chuckling] So, I was thinking--

36
00:01:33,676 --> 00:01:36,721
No, the Magnificent Dr. Presto
is not performing tonight.

37
00:01:36,805 --> 00:01:39,057
-Come on, I--
-Dude, magic is always lame,

38
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:42,727
but it's especially lame here,
where there's actual magic.

39
00:01:42,811 --> 00:01:45,939
As a counter argument...
check your pocket.

40
00:01:48,566 --> 00:01:49,943
The other one.

41
00:01:51,236 --> 00:01:54,364
Oh, shoot, sorry. [chuckles lightly]
It's my pocket.

42
00:01:55,406 --> 00:01:57,492
-Ta-da!
-Dope.

43
00:01:57,575 --> 00:01:59,160
You know what? You can perform.

44
00:01:59,244 --> 00:02:01,412
-Really?
-Yeah, you changed my mind

45
00:02:01,496 --> 00:02:02,872
with that pocket thing.

46
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:04,124
Oh, boffo! [chuckles lightly]

47
00:02:05,041 --> 00:02:06,209
Oh.

48
00:02:06,292 --> 00:02:07,752
-You're being mean.
-Yep.

49
00:02:14,592 --> 00:02:16,803
{\an8}I am very excited for tonight.

50
00:02:16,886 --> 00:02:19,556
{\an8}And dare I say, you all look so splendid,

51
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:22,684
{\an8}you could work the coat check
at the Met Gala.

52
00:02:22,767 --> 00:02:25,603
{\an8}Oh, speaking of the Met Gala,
remember that security cam footage

53
00:02:25,687 --> 00:02:27,939
{\an8}of Solange and Jay-Z
fighting in the elevator?

54
00:02:28,022 --> 00:02:30,525
{\an8}I learned to read lips.
Turns out she was yelling,

55
00:02:30,608 --> 00:02:33,236
{\an8}"No fair! I wanted to be
the one to push the button."

56
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:34,779
{\an8}[chuckles]

57
00:02:34,863 --> 00:02:38,533
{\an8}So, uh, yeah, it wasn't as juicy
as some people maybe thought it was.

58
00:02:38,616 --> 00:02:41,202
{\an8}-[door opens]
-Hey, gang. Had a pretty good round today.

59
00:02:41,286 --> 00:02:44,247
{\an8}Better close this door. I don't want
all those birdies to follow me in here.

60
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:46,708
{\an8}-[chuckles]
-[groans] Why?

61
00:02:46,791 --> 00:02:48,710
{\an8}Okay, Brent, hurry up and change
so we can get to the party.

62
00:02:48,793 --> 00:02:49,711
{\an8}Oh, right, hang on.

63
00:02:49,794 --> 00:02:52,088
{\an8}Uh, Janet gave me this...

64
00:02:52,171 --> 00:02:53,298
{\an8}Tuxedo in a can.

65
00:02:54,382 --> 00:02:56,217
{\an8}-[Tahani] Oh!
-[Chidi] Ooh.

66
00:02:56,301 --> 00:02:59,679
{\an8}I came this close to firing Janet,
but she's gotten a lot better.

67
00:02:59,762 --> 00:03:02,348
{\an8}Okay. We're not leaving yet.
I need to show you all something.

68
00:03:03,224 --> 00:03:06,352
This is the result
of months of observation.

69
00:03:07,145 --> 00:03:09,063
Now, I know
you're gonna think I'm crazy...

70
00:03:09,147 --> 00:03:10,940
No, why would we think that?

71
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:13,192
{\an8}But there is something wrong
with this neighborhood.

72
00:03:13,985 --> 00:03:16,029
And it involves the people in this room.

73
00:03:17,655 --> 00:03:20,116
[Eleanor] So crazy that we're
at the end of this thing

74
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:21,910
and we have no idea how we did.

75
00:03:22,493 --> 00:03:26,539
{\an8}Janet, any chance you could
get a look inside that obelisk?

76
00:03:26,623 --> 00:03:28,041
{\an8}Check that magic scoreboard?

77
00:03:28,124 --> 00:03:29,792
{\an8}There is a chance, yes.

78
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:32,545
{\an8}About one in 970 trillion.

79
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:33,963
Let's give her a whirl.

80
00:03:34,756 --> 00:03:37,050
It did not work.

81
00:03:37,133 --> 00:03:38,092
I'll be right back.

82
00:03:38,176 --> 00:03:39,302
{\an8}Ugh!

83
00:03:40,011 --> 00:03:45,266
{\an8}I feel okay about most of it, but I just
wish we had one concrete sign

84
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:46,559
that Brent has improved.

85
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:48,645
One moment where he bumps into someone

86
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:51,189
and sincerely says,
"Oops, my bad," you know?

87
00:03:51,272 --> 00:03:52,732
I would kill for an "Oops, my bad."

88
00:03:52,815 --> 00:03:54,943
Who's a girl gotta fork
to get an "Oops, my bad"?

89
00:03:55,026 --> 00:03:58,446
Hey, hey, hey, panicking about
this experiment at crucial moments

90
00:03:58,529 --> 00:03:59,948
is kinda my move.

91
00:04:00,031 --> 00:04:01,699
-Don't fall apart on me now.
-I won't.

92
00:04:01,783 --> 00:04:04,202
It's just... You know me.

93
00:04:04,285 --> 00:04:06,996
On Earth, I never played a game
unless I knew I could either win,

94
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,332
or bribe the ref so he'd throw it for me,

95
00:04:09,415 --> 00:04:14,045
and if we lose, I'm gonna be so mad.
[groans]

96
00:04:14,128 --> 00:04:15,213
Just one more day.

97
00:04:15,296 --> 00:04:18,258
We're gonna stick to the plan,
not do anything radical.

98
00:04:18,341 --> 00:04:23,513
Though we could do something... magical.

99
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:24,889
You gotta let it go, man.

100
00:04:24,973 --> 00:04:26,224
She's right.

101
00:04:27,475 --> 00:04:30,144
[Simone] I've been suspicious
about this place since day one.

102
00:04:30,228 --> 00:04:32,146
Over the last few months,
I've been collecting data,

103
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:33,314
and now I am positive.

104
00:04:33,398 --> 00:04:35,108
Something is truly forked up.

105
00:04:35,191 --> 00:04:36,943
You didn't tell me
about any of this, muffin!

106
00:04:37,026 --> 00:04:38,403
Okay, you call her "muffin?"

107
00:04:38,903 --> 00:04:41,072
I'm getting a lot of breaking news
at once here.

108
00:04:41,155 --> 00:04:42,115
I was gathering evidence.

109
00:04:42,198 --> 00:04:44,784
I didn't want to compromise the integrity
of the data collection.

110
00:04:44,867 --> 00:04:46,327
Oh, so romantic.

111
00:04:47,662 --> 00:04:48,830
Here's what I know...

112
00:04:48,913 --> 00:04:52,208
Eleanor and Michael are up to something,
and it's focused on us.

113
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:56,629
I mean, there are 300 people
in the neighborhood, and somehow,

114
00:04:56,713 --> 00:04:59,549
they just spend all their time
talking to the six people in this room.

115
00:04:59,632 --> 00:05:01,884
Well, I mean, who else
are they gonna talk to? [chuckles lightly]

116
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:03,011
Dumb Shorts Cathy?

117
00:05:03,094 --> 00:05:05,263
-[chuckles]
-What is your problem with her?

118
00:05:05,346 --> 00:05:09,017
-I mean... shorts? "Cathy"?
-[Brent chuckles]

119
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:10,560
What isn't my problem with her?

120
00:05:11,352 --> 00:05:13,146
Jianyu, you okay? You look sweaty.

121
00:05:13,229 --> 00:05:14,981
Oh, no, he's fine.

122
00:05:15,064 --> 00:05:17,650
He always sweats when he's meditating.

123
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:19,485
He calls it "sweat-itating."

124
00:05:20,069 --> 00:05:24,699
No, I mean, um, he doesn't talk,
so I call it that. [chuckles nervously]

125
00:05:24,782 --> 00:05:26,159
I'm friends with Sting.

126
00:05:26,242 --> 00:05:27,702
I can't take it anymore.

127
00:05:27,785 --> 00:05:31,247
I know something and it's just graduated
from hot goss to relevant AF.

128
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:33,207
Yes, I'm gonna. I'm gonna.

129
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:38,546
That's not Jianyu. His name is Jason,
and he's here by mistake.

130
00:05:38,629 --> 00:05:41,382
Chidi's been helping him hide
and become a better person.

131
00:05:41,883 --> 00:05:42,717
[exhales sharply]

132
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,928
I also knew about this, of course.

133
00:05:46,763 --> 00:05:48,056
Might as well come clean, darling.

134
00:05:50,308 --> 00:05:53,561
Hi, Simone.
Jason Mendoza, Jacksonville, Florida.

135
00:05:53,644 --> 00:05:55,229
Go, Jags, obviously.

136
00:05:55,313 --> 00:05:56,939
Um, what else about me...

137
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:58,107
I was born in a swimming pool...

138
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:00,651
Okay. You never told me about this, Ducky!

139
00:06:00,735 --> 00:06:04,363
"Ducky?" I'm gonna have to sit down.
This is too much.

140
00:06:04,447 --> 00:06:06,657
Well, I swore I wouldn't tell,

141
00:06:06,741 --> 00:06:09,869
and keeping your word is a central tenet
of deontological ethics.

142
00:06:09,952 --> 00:06:11,621
Oh, so romantic.

143
00:06:11,704 --> 00:06:16,959
Okay, let's assume certain things are odd
about this place. What is your theory?

144
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:17,877
I don't know.

145
00:06:18,753 --> 00:06:20,171
Maybe this isn't the Good Place.

146
00:06:20,254 --> 00:06:21,464
Maybe it's a test.

147
00:06:21,547 --> 00:06:24,592
My best guess,
it's some kind of experiment.

148
00:06:24,675 --> 00:06:26,552
We're being observed
in a closed environment.

149
00:06:27,428 --> 00:06:29,972
Simone, look at this logically.

150
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:32,058
We are in paradise.

151
00:06:32,141 --> 00:06:35,311
There's fresh air, mountains, Janet!

152
00:06:35,394 --> 00:06:38,022
And yes, some of us are under 5'10",

153
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:41,359
but other than that,
it is literally perfect here.

154
00:06:41,442 --> 00:06:42,485
[Simone] No, it is not.

155
00:06:42,568 --> 00:06:43,820
Jason is proof.

156
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:46,739
And if you need more evidence
that this isn't the Good Place,

157
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:49,158
clearly, he's not the only one
who doesn't belong.

158
00:06:50,493 --> 00:06:53,329
Actually, she's right.
And I know it for a fact.

159
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:56,499
For the first time ever,
I am desperate for you to keep talking.

160
00:06:56,582 --> 00:06:58,876
Well, right at the beginning,
I talked to Mike and Eleanor,

161
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,795
and they were like,
"Yeah, don't tell anyone this,

162
00:07:00,878 --> 00:07:04,757
but there's a place better than this,
the Best Place,

163
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:06,509
and that's where you're headed, <i>amigo."</i>

164
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:07,844
I don't think they actually
called you <i>"amigo."</i>

165
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:10,096
I had to go through the year here,
kind of a test I guess,

166
00:07:10,179 --> 00:07:11,222
which, obviously, I aced.

167
00:07:11,305 --> 00:07:14,142
So, at midnight I'm on the first Escalade
out of here, baby.

168
00:07:14,225 --> 00:07:15,143
-Brent?
-Yeah?

169
00:07:15,226 --> 00:07:16,394
-Think about this.
-Okay.

170
00:07:16,477 --> 00:07:19,397
How could you get into the Best Place?

171
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:24,861
You would literally have to be one of the
most incredible people in the universe.

172
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,824
It makes sense to me.
I don't know what to tell you. [scoffs]

173
00:07:29,907 --> 00:07:32,410
Okay, in the words of Princess Kate

174
00:07:32,493 --> 00:07:34,454
after we came back
from our shopping trip in Ibiza,

175
00:07:34,537 --> 00:07:35,997
"There's a lot to unpack here."

176
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:39,959
Perhaps we should just put
our concerns aside and enjoy ourselves.

177
00:07:40,042 --> 00:07:41,252
No way.

178
00:07:41,335 --> 00:07:44,213
We have to figure out exactly
what is going on here.

179
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:47,717
Okay, just go to the party,
but keep your eyes open.

180
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,469
-I've got a special mission for us.
-Oh, I--

181
00:07:49,552 --> 00:07:52,638
Oh, good.
Muffin and Ducky are on the case.

182
00:07:54,932 --> 00:07:55,933
[indistinct chatter]

183
00:07:58,769 --> 00:08:00,605
-How's it going?
-Awesome.

184
00:08:00,688 --> 00:08:03,149
-No, it isn't.
-Oh, yeah, terrible.

185
00:08:03,232 --> 00:08:06,068
[sighs] Simone knows the neighborhood
isn't what it appears to be.

186
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:07,904
She's been collecting evidence for months.

187
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:11,657
So, all that hanging out with Brent,
and participating in group activities...

188
00:08:11,741 --> 00:08:13,075
Was under false pretenses.

189
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:15,745
She was observing him.
She's been observing everything.

190
00:08:15,828 --> 00:08:17,830
-Guys, pick a card.
-[Eleanor gasps]

191
00:08:17,914 --> 00:08:19,499
-Yes.
-No time.

192
00:08:19,582 --> 00:08:20,791
The subjects are onto us.

193
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:24,712
They know something weird is going on,
and it could derail the entire experiment.

194
00:08:24,795 --> 00:08:27,048
Oh, no.

195
00:08:27,131 --> 00:08:29,634
Oh, sorry, uh, that was unintentional.

196
00:08:32,094 --> 00:08:32,929
[Chidi] What?

197
00:08:34,055 --> 00:08:36,599
[Simone] There's nothing here.
Did you find anything?

198
00:08:36,682 --> 00:08:39,268
Just some song lyrics Michael wrote.

199
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:42,813
"Here's a trippy little ditty,
'bout a train to Groovy City.

200
00:08:42,897 --> 00:08:47,401
Open up your freaky crystal mind,
and we'll have a cosmic good time."

201
00:08:47,485 --> 00:08:49,403
That makes me think we're in hell.

202
00:08:49,487 --> 00:08:52,365
Look, we tried to prove your theory,
but it feels like we came up empty.

203
00:08:52,448 --> 00:08:56,410
Chidi, there is so much evidence they've
been lying. How can you not see that?

204
00:08:56,494 --> 00:08:58,329
Eleanor told me
that this was her first neighborhood.

205
00:08:58,412 --> 00:09:00,873
Maybe some of these
are just honest mistakes.

206
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:07,964
And, also, she told me some other stuff
that I really want to be true.

207
00:09:08,965 --> 00:09:10,466
What kind of stuff?

208
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:14,345
Well, it was something about us.

209
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:20,309
Why does everything I do fall apart
so close to the end?

210
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:22,770
My first experiment, now this experiment.

211
00:09:22,853 --> 00:09:26,941
I only got halfway through writing
"The Purple Train to Groovy City."

212
00:09:27,024 --> 00:09:29,443
-I just ran out of creative juice.
-[Eleanor] Focus.

213
00:09:29,527 --> 00:09:32,238
We cannot let this slip away from us
at the last second.

214
00:09:32,321 --> 00:09:34,699
New plan, forget the toasts.

215
00:09:34,782 --> 00:09:36,158
We do nothing,

216
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:38,119
and we hope that our early successes

217
00:09:38,202 --> 00:09:40,580
make up for the embarrassing mess
we've become.

218
00:09:40,663 --> 00:09:42,623
Like Facebook or America.

219
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:45,209
Okay? Sound good? Michael?

220
00:09:45,293 --> 00:09:49,130
We have no way to know
what this really means for the experiment.

221
00:09:49,797 --> 00:09:52,258
I don't think we can play it safe.
I have a plan.

222
00:09:52,341 --> 00:09:56,721
It's risky, but it might be the only way
to get them to where they need to be.

223
00:09:58,139 --> 00:09:58,973
Do you trust me?

224
00:10:00,057 --> 00:10:02,643
Yeah, fork it. Whatever it is, I'm in.

225
00:10:02,727 --> 00:10:05,021
-I'm always down for forking it.
-We trust you, Michael.

226
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:09,817
Then trust...
the Magnificent Dr. Presto!

227
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:14,697
Man, you cannot pull that hat out
after you ask us if we trust you.

228
00:10:15,364 --> 00:10:16,365
Soulmates?

229
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:19,243
That's what Eleanor said,
that we're soulmates?

230
00:10:19,327 --> 00:10:20,870
Yep. Pretty neat, huh?

231
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:23,664
I think it's pretty neat. Do you think
it's pretty neat, intensely, forever?

232
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:29,045
Chidi, I really like you,
but I don't think we're soulmates.

233
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:31,422
Because I don't think
soulmates actually exist.

234
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:32,882
Right.

235
00:10:34,342 --> 00:10:35,343
Right, right.

236
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:37,511
-Right?
-Think rationally.

237
00:10:37,595 --> 00:10:40,473
Isn't it weird that she only told
one of us that we're soulmates?

238
00:10:40,556 --> 00:10:43,476
Is it odd? Yes.

239
00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:46,312
Does it mean that Eleanor's motives
are questionable?

240
00:10:46,395 --> 00:10:47,730
Also, yes.

241
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:50,483
But does it suggest
that she wasn't being truthful?

242
00:10:50,566 --> 00:10:52,610
Yes. Okay, I'm starting to see your point.

243
00:10:52,693 --> 00:10:53,694
[Simone] Whoa!

244
00:10:56,447 --> 00:10:58,240
What does that mean?

245
00:10:58,741 --> 00:11:00,451
Why are there only four of us?
Why not Tahani and Jason?

246
00:11:00,534 --> 00:11:03,204
Why are there emojis?
I mean, one of them's party hat guy.

247
00:11:03,287 --> 00:11:04,872
I mean, that's good, right? He's friendly.

248
00:11:04,955 --> 00:11:08,668
It's better than thermometer guy,
or angry cat or smiling poop coil.

249
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:10,002
Okay. We have to get back to the party

250
00:11:10,086 --> 00:11:11,837
before Eleanor and Michael
notice we're missing.

251
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:13,214
Great plan. Let's kiss.

252
00:11:13,297 --> 00:11:15,508
Sorry, still thinking about
the soulmate thing.

253
00:11:15,591 --> 00:11:16,967
-Let's go.
-Okay.

254
00:11:17,051 --> 00:11:20,513
[Eleanor] Ladies and gentlemen...
I can't believe I'm saying this.

255
00:11:20,596 --> 00:11:22,932
The Magnificent Dr. Presto!

256
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:24,058
[crowd applauding]

257
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:28,729
Thank you. Now, I know some of you
may not believe in magic--

258
00:11:28,813 --> 00:11:30,439
Well, I think they believe in some magic.

259
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:34,276
Yesterday, everybody ate a lollipop
that let them talk to birds.

260
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:37,238
-[crowd applauding]
-Okay, but this is Earth magic,

261
00:11:37,321 --> 00:11:41,575
and it's harder,
and if you don't understand that,

262
00:11:41,659 --> 00:11:46,372
I'm here... to change your mind.

263
00:11:46,455 --> 00:11:47,665
Ha-ha! [chuckles]

264
00:11:47,748 --> 00:11:52,128
Oh, come on. It started out as
a dollar bill and now it's four quarters.

265
00:11:52,211 --> 00:11:53,295
"Change" your mind?

266
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:54,880
-Michael, it's three quarters.
-What?

267
00:11:54,964 --> 00:11:56,006
Oh, oh...

268
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:57,216
Three quarters.

269
00:11:57,967 --> 00:12:00,761
Three quarters. Even harder.

270
00:12:00,845 --> 00:12:02,263
-Thank you.
-[scattered applause]

271
00:12:02,346 --> 00:12:03,806
Can you make them clap harder?

272
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:05,433
They see what they see, man.

273
00:12:05,933 --> 00:12:07,143
Did you guys find anything?

274
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:11,063
Yes, proof that the four of us, and only
the four of us, are being forked with.

275
00:12:11,147 --> 00:12:13,858
But we still don't have any hard proof
that this place is evil,

276
00:12:13,941 --> 00:12:16,777
or that Michael and Eleanor
are nefarious, so, you know,

277
00:12:16,861 --> 00:12:18,821
no one's heart needs to break just yet.

278
00:12:18,904 --> 00:12:20,739
I'm with him. This place is fine.

279
00:12:20,823 --> 00:12:22,658
If you guys don't make the cut
for the Best Place,

280
00:12:22,741 --> 00:12:25,703
I'll try to put in a good word for you.
You guys got business cards?

281
00:12:25,786 --> 00:12:28,330
Brent. I need a volunteer. Come on up.

282
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:30,249
[resident whoops]

283
00:12:30,332 --> 00:12:35,379
Okay, Brent, I want you to take off
your wristwatch and place it in my hat.

284
00:12:35,463 --> 00:12:39,467
Now, this is a Rolex. It's the exact same
watch Richie Sambora wears.

285
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:40,551
-Ah!
-Be careful.

286
00:12:40,634 --> 00:12:45,431
And now, the Magnificent Dr. Presto...

287
00:12:45,514 --> 00:12:47,308
will transform your...

288
00:12:47,391 --> 00:12:48,809
-[ground rumbling]
-[Michael] Oh, oh...

289
00:12:48,893 --> 00:12:50,519
[crowd exclaiming]

290
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:52,480
[people screaming]

291
00:12:52,563 --> 00:12:53,814
[Michael] Oh, whoa, no, no!

292
00:12:53,898 --> 00:12:54,940
-[Brent screams]
-[thuds]

293
00:12:55,024 --> 00:12:56,317
[panicked chatter]

294
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:59,820
Brent, can you hear me?

295
00:12:59,904 --> 00:13:04,158
If it somehow helps,
there's a small dove in your pocket.

296
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:08,496
Never mind.

297
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:13,751
[Michael] Brent, I'm so sorry.
I must've screwed up the trick somehow.

298
00:13:13,834 --> 00:13:16,003
Hold on. We're gonna get you out of there.

299
00:13:16,086 --> 00:13:16,921
[Brent] Yeah, you better.

300
00:13:17,004 --> 00:13:19,131
I got a hell of a lawsuit on my hands!
I'm gonna frickin' own this place.

301
00:13:19,757 --> 00:13:20,758
Okay.

302
00:13:20,841 --> 00:13:24,053
Okay, everyone, uh, please disperse.
We'll let you know when it's safe.

303
00:13:24,136 --> 00:13:27,139
Uh, you three stay here.
Keep an eye on Brent.

304
00:13:27,223 --> 00:13:30,851
We're gonna try and fix this remotely,
using eternal-being technology.

305
00:13:30,935 --> 00:13:33,771
-Tahani, Jianyu, try and find a rope.
-Right-o.

306
00:13:33,854 --> 00:13:37,066
Okay, so what do we do?
Try to climb down or wait for the rope?

307
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:39,026
Neither, we get the fork out of here.

308
00:13:39,109 --> 00:13:42,446
Chidi, a giant hell-hole just opened up
and swallowed one of us.

309
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:46,158
I don't care what this place really is.
Giant holes are bad and we should go.

310
00:13:46,242 --> 00:13:47,576
Or giant holes are bad,

311
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:50,704
so if someone falls into one,
you try to help get him out.

312
00:13:50,788 --> 00:13:52,206
-[ground rumbles]
-[John screams]

313
00:13:52,289 --> 00:13:53,457
I'm not scared.

314
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:56,168
I'm shouting so you know I'm okay.
I am very brave.

315
00:13:56,961 --> 00:14:01,090
Whoo! I hope this works. We basically
just confirmed that we're lying to them.

316
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:04,593
Oh, man. Was this a bad idea?
I mean, what if this was a bad idea?

317
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:06,095
It wasn't, homie. It was a good idea.

318
00:14:06,887 --> 00:14:09,223
-Can anyone else weigh in?
-[Jason] I'm serious.

319
00:14:09,306 --> 00:14:13,060
In football, trying to run out the clock
and hoping for the best never works.

320
00:14:13,143 --> 00:14:14,311
It's called prevent defense.

321
00:14:14,395 --> 00:14:17,106
You don't take any chances
and try and hang on to your lead.

322
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:20,943
But prevent defense
just prevents you from winning.

323
00:14:21,819 --> 00:14:23,779
It's always better to try something.

324
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:26,699
Jason, that was... coherent!

325
00:14:26,782 --> 00:14:29,201
Oh, sorry. I didn't mean to.

326
00:14:29,285 --> 00:14:31,036
It's a good plan, Michael.

327
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:34,081
Hopefully, they've bonded enough
as a group to rescue Brent,

328
00:14:34,164 --> 00:14:36,250
call me, get a train
and all head out of here together.

329
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:38,460
But was it a mistake to have
Brent fall in?

330
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:42,089
We could've had Chidi fall in, right?
Or a cute baby panda.

331
00:14:42,172 --> 00:14:45,009
Or maybe, you know, a box of donuts.
Everyone loves donuts.

332
00:14:45,092 --> 00:14:46,510
Brent was the right choice.

333
00:14:46,594 --> 00:14:48,888
It's not a tough call
whether to save Chidi,

334
00:14:48,971 --> 00:14:51,515
because he's a brilliant and kind person,

335
00:14:51,599 --> 00:14:54,643
with a caboose you can bounce a quarter
off of and I know 'cause I've done it.

336
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:58,731
We threw Brent in there
because there is no reason

337
00:14:58,814 --> 00:15:01,317
any of them should help him,
because Brent sucks.

338
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,485
Brent is the opposite of a box of donuts.

339
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:05,905
-Toilet full of broccoli.
-Yeah, kinda.

340
00:15:05,988 --> 00:15:07,990
Brent is a toilet full of broccoli.

341
00:15:08,073 --> 00:15:10,826
But because he sucks so bad,

342
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:14,246
if they do risk their safety to help him,
they'll get more points.

343
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:16,206
Basically, it's a Hail Mary.

344
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:20,586
It's risky, but if we complete it,
we win the game.

345
00:15:20,669 --> 00:15:23,297
That was two good analogies in a row.

346
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:26,258
I'm now worried
he's a demon in a Jason suit.

347
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:29,428
Are we really in hell?

348
00:15:29,511 --> 00:15:34,016
I didn't lead a perfect life on Earth,
but I worked very hard.

349
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:35,935
Making fun of people you'd never even met.

350
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:37,603
I guess you must be right, Simone,

351
00:15:37,686 --> 00:15:39,605
because you always have to be.
[chuckles lightly]

352
00:15:39,688 --> 00:15:41,482
Hey, are you the bottom
of a coal-fired pizza?

353
00:15:41,565 --> 00:15:44,944
-Why, because I'm burnt?
-Gah! You are always right. [groans]

354
00:15:45,027 --> 00:15:47,529
If it is hell, I know why I'm here.

355
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:50,824
Almond milk. I drank so much of it,

356
00:15:50,908 --> 00:15:53,160
despite the negative
environmental impacts.

357
00:15:53,243 --> 00:15:56,580
Wherever we are, I do not wanna be here
when the clock hits zero.

358
00:15:56,664 --> 00:15:58,624
Now might be our only chance to escape.

359
00:15:58,707 --> 00:15:59,625
Not without Brent.

360
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:03,337
Do you think if the roles were reversed,
he would waste any time rescuing you?

361
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:06,882
Maybe... if Elle Macpherson were nearby
and he wanted to impress her,

362
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:09,677
or if he thought
that I was a prince he could ransom...

363
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:14,056
That's not the point.
He is a person in a hole.

364
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:18,185
I have a duty to help him get out.
What he would do is irrelevant.

365
00:16:18,268 --> 00:16:19,395
I don't think it is.

366
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:22,106
If you do a science experiment
a thousand times

367
00:16:22,189 --> 00:16:24,566
and always get the same results,
you move on.

368
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:28,028
We've given Brent a thousand chances
to be a good person.

369
00:16:28,112 --> 00:16:32,908
In one of them, he was so awful,
you punched him in the face.

370
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:36,120
Okay, when I did that,
I thought cutting him out of our group

371
00:16:36,203 --> 00:16:39,915
meant that he would have to find
another place in heaven to hang out.

372
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:42,251
That's changed. I can't just leave him.

373
00:16:43,752 --> 00:16:44,753
Well...

374
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:47,464
I respect your position.

375
00:16:49,466 --> 00:16:51,093
I respect yours.

376
00:16:55,347 --> 00:16:57,683
Look, I know everything's
really scary right now,

377
00:16:57,766 --> 00:16:59,101
but I just have to say it.

378
00:16:59,977 --> 00:17:02,813
That was the most boring breakup
I've ever seen.

379
00:17:04,106 --> 00:17:04,940
[car engine starts]

380
00:17:07,151 --> 00:17:08,694
[Brent] Hey, Chidi, shake it off.

381
00:17:08,777 --> 00:17:11,113
-Another bus comes every 15 minutes.
-[Chidi] Brent.

382
00:17:19,788 --> 00:17:21,957
-Where are they?
-They never called a train.

383
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:24,793
-They must've taken Brent's Escalade.
-Oh, that's good.

384
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:28,464
The important thing is that
the group bonded and stayed together.

385
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:31,633
-[Brent] Hello? Can someone help us?
-"Us"?

386
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:34,219
Yeah, this frickin' genius
tried to help me and he fell in.

387
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:36,930
-I thought you were smart, man.
-Are you serious right now?

388
00:17:37,014 --> 00:17:39,349
[Eleanor] Well, turns out the group
did not bond.

389
00:17:39,433 --> 00:17:41,268
The group snapped in half.

390
00:17:43,312 --> 00:17:46,482
Will you help us? These rocks are
really sharp down here.

391
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:48,192
-I'm scared.
-I'm not.

392
00:17:48,275 --> 00:17:50,444
-Just give us a second.
-Guys, I think we're cooked.

393
00:17:50,527 --> 00:17:53,363
-It's over.
-No. No way.

394
00:17:53,447 --> 00:17:56,450
I am not giving up.
I told you I only play games I can win,

395
00:17:56,533 --> 00:17:58,577
and I played this game,
so that means we can win.

396
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:00,537
-I don't think that tracks.
-Shut up. What do you know?

397
00:18:00,621 --> 00:18:04,666
Literally everything, but keep going.
I am liking this energy from you.

398
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:07,961
We have eight minutes left,
so that means we keep trying.

399
00:18:08,045 --> 00:18:10,172
What else can we try?
We've already blown everything up.

400
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:11,131
We can't blow it up again.

401
00:18:11,215 --> 00:18:12,591
If there's one thing I know in this world,

402
00:18:12,674 --> 00:18:15,385
it's that you can always
blow up the same thing twice.

403
00:18:16,553 --> 00:18:17,554
He's right.

404
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,307
We have one last move here.

405
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:23,102
Guys, we are so sorry about your ordeal.

406
00:18:23,185 --> 00:18:25,020
We just have a few questions for you.

407
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:28,023
Where are John and Simone?
We can't find them.

408
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:31,527
They left.
I don't know where they went.

409
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:33,278
Typical. Disloyal jerks.

410
00:18:34,071 --> 00:18:37,116
You know, man, actually,
they really tried with you,

411
00:18:37,199 --> 00:18:38,534
and you made it very hard
to be your friend.

412
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:40,452
You wanna know what happened?

413
00:18:40,536 --> 00:18:42,663
They got jealous
because I'm going to the Best Place.

414
00:18:42,746 --> 00:18:43,789
They bugged out.

415
00:18:43,872 --> 00:18:45,290
You're not going to the Best Place.

416
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:48,168
Don't you get it? They're torturing you.
They're torturing all of us.

417
00:18:48,836 --> 00:18:49,878
[Brent scoffs]

418
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:52,256
Because this is the Bad Place.

419
00:18:55,592 --> 00:18:57,052
[both cackling]

420
00:19:01,056 --> 00:19:04,143
Oh, man.
I can't believe you figured it out.

421
00:19:04,226 --> 00:19:08,397
Wait, he's right?
This is the Bad Place?

422
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,607
Yeah. Damn it, he's right.

423
00:19:10,691 --> 00:19:12,568
-We had a good run, though.
-We did.

424
00:19:12,651 --> 00:19:15,279
-[both chuckling]
-So, no Best Place?

425
00:19:15,362 --> 00:19:16,738
-[imitating Brent] "So, no Best Place?"
-No.

426
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:20,534
Oh, Brent, you big white oaf.
Never change, bud. [chuckles]

427
00:19:20,617 --> 00:19:23,745
{\an8}Well, I guess we should let them know
you guys are on your way.

428
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:25,205
{\an8}-Yeah.
-Wait. On our way where?

429
00:19:25,289 --> 00:19:26,582
{\an8}The actual Bad Place.

430
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:29,209
{\an8}They let us toy with you a little
just for kicks,

431
00:19:29,293 --> 00:19:31,628
{\an8}-but now you're going... [vocalizes]
-[Eleanor chuckles]

432
00:19:31,712 --> 00:19:33,088
{\an8}[Michael] And trust me on this...

433
00:19:33,714 --> 00:19:35,174
{\an8}it's a lot worse.

434
00:19:35,257 --> 00:19:37,259
{\an8}[Eleanor and Michael cackling]

435
00:19:41,763 --> 00:19:44,224
{\an8}-[Tahani] Well done.
-Let's hope it works.

436
00:19:44,308 --> 00:19:45,934
{\an8}We only have a minute left.

437
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:47,311
{\an8}<i>Man, crazy twist, huh?</i>

438
00:19:48,312 --> 00:19:49,938
{\an8}<i>It's like something</i>
<i>out of a Chip Driver novel.</i>

439
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:53,150
{\an8}-Leave me alone, Brent.
-I'm kinda freaking out over here, man.

440
00:19:53,692 --> 00:19:56,528
-You're my only real friend.
-I'm not your friend. I don't like you.

441
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:58,780
-But you helped me.
-Yeah, I did.

442
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:01,992
Because I have this stupid moral code
that forces me to help everyone.

443
00:20:02,075 --> 00:20:05,954
But you have never helped anyone
because you don't care about other people,

444
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:08,040
which is the bare minimum
that a person has to do.

445
00:20:08,123 --> 00:20:10,250
Just care, a little,
about the other people around you,

446
00:20:10,334 --> 00:20:12,085
and you can't do it.

447
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:17,549
What are you trying to say here?

448
00:20:19,635 --> 00:20:22,679
You are a bad person.

449
00:20:25,015 --> 00:20:27,976
-You can do this.
-Come on, dumb-dumb. Faster.

450
00:20:31,188 --> 00:20:32,606
No, I'm not.

451
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:36,318
I'm not... I'm not a bad person.

452
00:20:37,152 --> 00:20:39,655
I'm not. I'm a good person.

453
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:43,825
Oh, man.

454
00:20:45,202 --> 00:20:47,829
Oh, no, no, no.

455
00:20:48,997 --> 00:20:49,957
No, no.

456
00:20:50,582 --> 00:20:55,337
Look, Chidi, whatever happens next,
I, uh, need to say this to you.

457
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:57,005
All right? I am...

458
00:20:57,673 --> 00:21:00,968
I am so, so sor--

459
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:13,188
Sorry, Eleanor asked me to bring her this
the second the experiment was over.

460
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:15,274
Well, you know what they say.

461
00:21:15,357 --> 00:21:17,776
It's zero o'clock in the sky somewhere.
