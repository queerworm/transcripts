1
00:00:04,713 --> 00:00:06,005
What are you doing?

2
00:00:06,256 --> 00:00:08,383
Dude, I'm freaked out about
my meeting with Michael,

3
00:00:08,466 --> 00:00:11,010
and if I spend one more second
staring at Creepo the Clown,

4
00:00:11,094 --> 00:00:12,470
-I'm gonna lose it.
-You named the clowns?

5
00:00:12,887 --> 00:00:16,224
Psycho, Creepo, Crazy Head,
Stupid Juggling Weirdo,

6
00:00:16,307 --> 00:00:19,310
Freaky Feet, and Nightmare
George Washington.

7
00:00:19,728 --> 00:00:21,312
One of them has to go.

8
00:00:23,773 --> 00:00:26,776
Oh, sexy mailman. Much better.

9
00:00:26,943 --> 00:00:28,820
In five minutes, Michael wants
my help investigating

10
00:00:28,987 --> 00:00:32,073
what's making the neighborhood go nuts,
which is obviously me.

11
00:00:32,198 --> 00:00:34,951
I mean, I did promise I would help.
What do I do here?

12
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:38,121
Actually, the answer is...

13
00:00:38,204 --> 00:00:40,790
Right here, in this easily understandable
comic strip.

14
00:00:41,124 --> 00:00:43,209
Nope, in this book about the theory
of contractualism.

15
00:00:43,501 --> 00:00:44,711
<i>What We Owe to Each Other.</i>

16
00:00:44,794 --> 00:00:46,171
[gasps] I saw this movie.

17
00:00:46,254 --> 00:00:47,756
Laura Linney cries in a lake house

18
00:00:47,839 --> 00:00:50,175
because Jude Law left
her for his ex-wife's ghost.

19
00:00:50,258 --> 00:00:53,470
No. Quick summary of contractualism.

20
00:00:53,553 --> 00:00:57,140
Uh, imagine a group of reasonable people

21
00:00:57,223 --> 00:00:59,684
are coming up with the rules
for a new society.

22
00:00:59,768 --> 00:01:02,479
Like, "If your Uber driver talks to you,
the ride should be free"?

23
00:01:02,645 --> 00:01:07,484
Sure, but anyone can veto any rule
that they think is unfair.

24
00:01:07,567 --> 00:01:10,779
So, if you said,
"We should be able to break our promises

25
00:01:10,862 --> 00:01:15,366
without any repercussions,"
someone would veto that rule.

26
00:01:15,492 --> 00:01:18,369
Well, my first rule would be
that no one can veto my rules.

27
00:01:18,495 --> 00:01:21,873
Well, that's called "tyranny."
And it's generally frowned upon.

28
00:01:22,332 --> 00:01:24,834
If you make a promise to someone,
you should do it.

29
00:01:25,168 --> 00:01:28,213
Just like I promised to help
you and still am,

30
00:01:28,296 --> 00:01:30,465
despite your constant mockery.

31
00:01:30,548 --> 00:01:34,093
[mocking] "Despite your constant mockery."
Whatever, you love it.

32
00:01:34,302 --> 00:01:40,099
So, either I help him find the problem,
which is me, and I'm doomed...

33
00:01:40,183 --> 00:01:42,185
Or I don't help him,

34
00:01:42,268 --> 00:01:45,563
and then I'm behaving unethically
and the whole world goes crazy

35
00:01:45,647 --> 00:01:46,856
and I'm caught anyway.

36
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:50,443
I need to figure out a way
to both help him

37
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:52,737
and not help him at the same time.

38
00:01:53,029 --> 00:01:55,281
-That's literally not possible.
-Oh, really?

39
00:01:55,698 --> 00:01:58,576
I once posed as a hot prom date
for my cousin,

40
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:02,038
both helping him and later,
according to his therapist,

41
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:03,206
not helping him.

42
00:02:11,464 --> 00:02:13,633
[Michael muttering indistinctly]

43
00:02:17,387 --> 00:02:19,180
{\an8}Oh, hey, Eleanor. Thanks for coming in.

44
00:02:20,682 --> 00:02:21,766
{\an8}Sorry about the mess.

45
00:02:22,225 --> 00:02:25,728
{\an8}[clears throat] Oh, I forgot,
you don't see in nine dimensions.

46
00:02:26,521 --> 00:02:28,648
{\an8}There's just a lot of...
There's a lot of tension

47
00:02:28,731 --> 00:02:29,941
{\an8}in the air right now.

48
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:33,736
{\an8}Are you okay, buddy?
You seem kind of stressed.

49
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:36,114
{\an8}No, no, no, I'm fine.
Top of my game, actually.

50
00:02:36,197 --> 00:02:38,158
{\an8}Um, here, let me just...

51
00:02:38,783 --> 00:02:41,327
{\an8}Have a seat. There you go.

52
00:02:42,078 --> 00:02:45,206
{\an8}So, to prepare to meet all of you,

53
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:49,586
{\an8}I studied the human concept of friends.

54
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:52,672
{\an8}I even watched all ten
seasons of the show <i>Friends.</i>

55
00:02:53,214 --> 00:02:56,134
{\an8}Boy, those Friends really were friends,
weren't they?

56
00:02:56,801 --> 00:02:59,637
{\an8}Although, and I realize
this is the kind of observation

57
00:02:59,721 --> 00:03:03,016
{\an8}that would only occur to the mind
of an eternal being...

58
00:03:04,225 --> 00:03:07,186
{\an8}How did they afford that apartment?

59
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:11,065
{\an8}A waitress and a chef with those Manhattan
real estate prices.

60
00:03:11,774 --> 00:03:13,693
{\an8}Yeah, we were all confused about that too.

61
00:03:13,776 --> 00:03:16,237
{\an8}Anyway, it's been a tough couple of days.

62
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:21,951
{\an8}Right now, I could really use a friend
by my side.

63
00:03:22,243 --> 00:03:28,291
{\an8}Well, you know me, the person who has
audibly promised to help you.

64
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:31,794
So, you need me to house-sit
the whole week?

65
00:03:32,211 --> 00:03:34,172
Sounds like somebody's
gonna have a sweet vacay.

66
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:36,883
As I told you before, my mom is very sick.

67
00:03:37,133 --> 00:03:38,801
I'm gonna help her move
into assisted living.

68
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:41,346
Well, I'm here for you.

69
00:03:41,429 --> 00:03:43,932
And your Wi-Fi is way better
than my neighbor's, so I'm in.

70
00:03:44,015 --> 00:03:46,351
It's gonna mean taking care of Lester too.

71
00:03:46,517 --> 00:03:48,102
Walk and feed him twice a day,

72
00:03:48,186 --> 00:03:50,772
-give him his kidney medicine.
-Yup, got it. Feed his kidneys.

73
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:52,106
-Eleanor...
-Yeah?

74
00:03:52,273 --> 00:03:54,067
This is gonna be a very stressful
week for me.

75
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:57,153
-I need to know that I can count on you.
-I won't let you down.

76
00:03:57,570 --> 00:03:58,947
I promise.

77
00:04:03,451 --> 00:04:05,787
Jianyu, my love. How are you?

78
00:04:07,622 --> 00:04:11,000
-I am decidedly so.
-That's very profound.

79
00:04:12,377 --> 00:04:14,170
Um, soulmate. An idea.

80
00:04:14,337 --> 00:04:17,340
Our neighborhood now features a spa,
and it offers couples packages.

81
00:04:17,548 --> 00:04:21,719
And I thought maybe we could get facials,
and do yoga, and talk

82
00:04:21,803 --> 00:04:24,681
in long, discursive sentences.

83
00:04:25,598 --> 00:04:27,600
What do you say?

84
00:04:28,726 --> 00:04:31,062
-Signs point to yes.
-Oh. [chuckles]

85
00:04:31,521 --> 00:04:33,481
Marvelous! We'll go today.

86
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:39,112
Dude, you got to come with us to the spa.

87
00:04:39,362 --> 00:04:41,572
No way. No, that's really weird.

88
00:04:41,656 --> 00:04:44,367
You can't make small talk with her
for one day without being caught?

89
00:04:44,492 --> 00:04:46,411
No, I can't. She freaks me out.

90
00:04:46,494 --> 00:04:49,038
She's so pretty, like Nala
from <i>The Lion King.</i>

91
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:53,334
And she talks so smart,
like Nala from <i>The Lion King.</i>

92
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:54,460
You gotta help me.

93
00:04:54,544 --> 00:04:57,297
Well, if I feel sympathy
for anyone, it's Tahani.

94
00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:00,174
She's going through the same thing I am,
but she doesn't know it.

95
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:02,802
Which means maybe
I'm obligated to tell her.

96
00:05:03,386 --> 00:05:05,096
Although, maybe it's better not to know.

97
00:05:05,179 --> 00:05:09,309
Is ignorance bliss, or will the painful
truth actually be healing...

98
00:05:09,517 --> 00:05:10,810
You ready, Jianyu?

99
00:05:10,893 --> 00:05:14,897
Oh, I cannot wait to just relax,
and talk, and chat

100
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:17,025
and just, you know...

101
00:05:17,108 --> 00:05:18,484
Get to know each other.

102
00:05:19,402 --> 00:05:22,655
Hey! Maybe I'll come too.

103
00:05:23,364 --> 00:05:26,659
Oh, well, Chidi...
It's just that this is, um...

104
00:05:26,951 --> 00:05:30,538
This is really more of a couples thing.

105
00:05:30,705 --> 00:05:31,914
I know.

106
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:36,252
But Eleanor's off with Michael, and Jianyu
feels comfortable when I'm around.

107
00:05:36,627 --> 00:05:37,837
Right?

108
00:05:38,421 --> 00:05:40,882
-Made in Taiwan.
-Yes, you were.

109
00:05:41,549 --> 00:05:42,925
You were made in Taiwan.

110
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:44,927
So... Couples date!

111
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:46,637
Let's go!

112
00:05:48,931 --> 00:05:52,018
I never really looked around
your office the first day.

113
00:05:52,143 --> 00:05:53,186
What is all this junk?

114
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:57,732
Well, technically, architects aren't
allowed to own any human objects, but...

115
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:00,651
Oh, I just love them so much.

116
00:06:00,735 --> 00:06:01,861
And over here, look at this.

117
00:06:02,361 --> 00:06:05,198
Aren't paper clips the most
amazing things in the world?

118
00:06:05,281 --> 00:06:06,824
Yeah. Sure.

119
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:09,994
Anyway, my current theory
is that some object

120
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:13,873
in the neighborhood is a design flaw
which is causing everything to go haywire.

121
00:06:13,998 --> 00:06:17,502
So we need to find that object.
We're gonna start with the rocks.

122
00:06:17,668 --> 00:06:20,463
Now, I've investigated all of the rocks
in the neighborhood.

123
00:06:21,589 --> 00:06:23,966
These 78 are the most suspicious.

124
00:06:25,343 --> 00:06:27,845
I mean, maybe to an architect
they might look suspicious,

125
00:06:27,929 --> 00:06:31,015
but to me, they just look like rocks,
so I'm not sure how I can help.

126
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:34,477
Do any of them look defective?

127
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,105
Sinister? You know,
like they're taunting you?

128
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:38,356
Always one step ahead?

129
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:41,734
You devious little monsters, you.

130
00:06:42,026 --> 00:06:44,695
Okay, let's take a deep
breath here, buddy.

131
00:06:44,862 --> 00:06:47,115
You need to chill a little.

132
00:06:47,448 --> 00:06:51,369
'Cause you have a very psycho,
"burnout guy muttering to himself

133
00:06:51,452 --> 00:06:53,538
at a library computer" type vibe.

134
00:06:53,704 --> 00:06:56,082
It's my responsibility to solve
the problem.

135
00:06:56,165 --> 00:06:59,168
What else can I do except keep working?

136
00:07:01,295 --> 00:07:03,464
You could stop working.

137
00:07:04,048 --> 00:07:06,926
Look, I promised to help you,
and honestly, the way I can help you

138
00:07:07,009 --> 00:07:08,636
is to force you to take a break.

139
00:07:08,803 --> 00:07:11,681
And not working will help me work?

140
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:18,396
Yes! Recharge the old batteries.
I promise this is gonna help both of us.

141
00:07:18,646 --> 00:07:19,689
Let's go.

142
00:07:20,356 --> 00:07:21,441
Okay.

143
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:26,571
Let's keep our eyes peeled for twigs
that may have a nefarious agenda.

144
00:07:26,654 --> 00:07:28,281
-Okay, crazy, come on.
-Yeah.

145
00:07:31,075 --> 00:07:32,076
[Tahani] Hello, Janet.

146
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,121
Jianyu and I are here
for the couples package, please.

147
00:07:35,329 --> 00:07:37,623
[clears throat]
And, also, I will be joining them.

148
00:07:37,874 --> 00:07:39,792
Great, and who is the other half
of your couple?

149
00:07:40,001 --> 00:07:41,252
Oh, no, no, it's just me.

150
00:07:41,544 --> 00:07:43,546
Couples are pairs of people.

151
00:07:43,838 --> 00:07:46,632
Yup, and, uh, there is a pair of people,
Tahani and Jianyu.

152
00:07:46,716 --> 00:07:49,594
And then also I am here.

153
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:50,928
Great, and who will be joining you?

154
00:07:51,596 --> 00:07:52,513
No one.

155
00:07:52,638 --> 00:07:54,390
Um, it's really quite simple, Janet.

156
00:07:54,515 --> 00:07:59,270
They are a couple,
and I am a third part of that couple,

157
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:03,774
a helper part who is here
for fun and excitement.

158
00:08:03,858 --> 00:08:04,901
It's a three-person couple.

159
00:08:06,402 --> 00:08:10,239
[in robotic voice]
Does not compute. Does not compute.

160
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,950
I'm just kidding. [laughs]

161
00:08:13,242 --> 00:08:16,078
I mean, it doesn't compute,
but I'm not gonna explode or anything.

162
00:08:16,287 --> 00:08:19,749
Right. Well, I'll see you inside, darling.

163
00:08:22,251 --> 00:08:23,794
Okay, you have to step up.

164
00:08:23,878 --> 00:08:27,340
Find a way to connect with her without,
you know, being you.

165
00:08:27,548 --> 00:08:31,093
What does that even mean?
Do I talk or not talk?

166
00:08:31,427 --> 00:08:34,722
Do I be nice to Tahani, or do I throw
all her jewelry in the toilet?

167
00:08:35,097 --> 00:08:36,849
That's the opposite of being nice?

168
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:38,559
So no toilet?

169
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:41,270
What is it with you and frozen yogurt?

170
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:43,439
Have you not heard of ice cream?

171
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:46,025
Oh, sure, but I've come to really like
frozen yogurt.

172
00:08:46,108 --> 00:08:49,570
There's something so human
about taking something great

173
00:08:49,654 --> 00:08:52,240
and ruining it a little
so you can have more of it.

174
00:08:52,323 --> 00:08:53,866
Ha! That is very human.

175
00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:57,203
Why do you need a human
to be your assistant?

176
00:08:57,411 --> 00:09:00,373
I mean, aren't there more of...

177
00:09:00,748 --> 00:09:01,999
Whatever you are?

178
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:04,877
Well, since we're becoming friends,

179
00:09:05,753 --> 00:09:07,296
like Ross and Phoebe...

180
00:09:07,463 --> 00:09:09,090
Weird combo to pick, but okay.

181
00:09:09,257 --> 00:09:10,591
I'm gonna tell you a secret.

182
00:09:12,134 --> 00:09:15,888
Usually, architects don't live
in their neighborhoods.

183
00:09:16,264 --> 00:09:18,808
Usually, the people show up,
we play the movie,

184
00:09:19,183 --> 00:09:22,144
Janet is there to answer questions,
and you're on your own.

185
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:25,815
But I had this theory.
I thought transition would be easier

186
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:27,942
if the architect were on-site

187
00:09:28,025 --> 00:09:29,610
for at least the first 1,000 years or so.

188
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:32,029
That's why you've been so freaked out,

189
00:09:32,113 --> 00:09:33,864
'cause your butt is on the line.

190
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:35,783
My boss thought I was nuts.

191
00:09:35,908 --> 00:09:40,162
And if this neighborhood doesn't work,
I am in big trouble.

192
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:43,374
But more importantly,
I promised all of you

193
00:09:43,457 --> 00:09:45,459
that you would be safe and happy.

194
00:09:45,543 --> 00:09:47,336
And you just don't break a promise.

195
00:09:48,379 --> 00:09:51,382
Unlike Ross, when he promised
Emily not to talk to Rachel.

196
00:09:52,049 --> 00:09:53,843
Wow, you are really into that show.

197
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:55,177
You know something?

198
00:09:55,469 --> 00:09:57,680
I feel better already.
Should we get back to work?

199
00:09:57,763 --> 00:10:03,352
[exclaiming] The whole point is to stop
thinking about work and start having fun.

200
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:05,896
Now, what should we do first?

201
00:10:06,522 --> 00:10:08,691
<i>♪ I'm going out ♪</i>

202
00:10:09,066 --> 00:10:11,902
<i>♪ In a blaze of glory ♪</i>

203
00:10:12,069 --> 00:10:14,196
<i>♪ Lord, I never drew first ♪</i>

204
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:16,282
<i>♪ But I drew first blood ♪</i>

205
00:10:16,365 --> 00:10:17,867
<i>♪ And I'm no one's son ♪</i>

206
00:10:17,992 --> 00:10:21,078
<i>♪ So call me young gun... ♪</i>

207
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:25,583
This is so interesting!
I mean, there's no point to it.

208
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:28,544
The images on the screen
relate to nothing.

209
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:30,713
Some time passed, and then it was over.

210
00:10:31,213 --> 00:10:32,548
That's karaoke!

211
00:10:32,923 --> 00:10:34,050
Oh, let's do it again.

212
00:10:34,425 --> 00:10:38,638
Okay, my hands are heated
to the ideal 105 degrees.

213
00:10:38,721 --> 00:10:39,930
Who would like to go first?

214
00:10:40,014 --> 00:10:41,599
Oh, well, what if I go first,

215
00:10:41,682 --> 00:10:43,559
and then perhaps Jianyu
could stand near me

216
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:45,936
and share some intimate
aspects of his life?

217
00:10:47,772 --> 00:10:50,024
Or what if...

218
00:10:51,359 --> 00:10:56,906
While Janet messages Tahani,
I massage Jianyu?

219
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:03,537
Jianyu, darling, let's discuss the arts.

220
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:07,541
I adore the impressionists.

221
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:10,294
Who's your favorite artist?

222
00:11:10,586 --> 00:11:13,756
I mean, Pitbull changed the game--

223
00:11:15,007 --> 00:11:19,428
Sorry, just working the oft-neglected
mandible area.

224
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:20,596
[muffled speaking]

225
00:11:25,476 --> 00:11:26,685
[gasps]

226
00:11:26,852 --> 00:11:27,853
Oh, man!

227
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:30,898
I didn't even want that thing.
Why am I trying to win it?

228
00:11:30,981 --> 00:11:33,150
Because the machine says it's a prize.

229
00:11:33,692 --> 00:11:34,902
[exclaiming excitedly]

230
00:11:35,486 --> 00:11:37,071
[Michael] How many tickets do I get? Six?

231
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:38,823
-Is that all?
-Well, watch this.

232
00:11:40,282 --> 00:11:41,409
[straining]

233
00:11:41,826 --> 00:11:43,160
-Is that allowed?
-Not really.

234
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:44,995
But it is a time-honored tradition.

235
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:46,872
Say no more. I got it. I got it.

236
00:11:49,708 --> 00:11:50,876
[whoops]

237
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,002
[applauding]

238
00:11:52,128 --> 00:11:53,254
You know something?

239
00:11:53,337 --> 00:11:55,631
As much as I've always
wanted to be around humans,

240
00:11:55,714 --> 00:11:59,218
I think I've missed a big part
of what makes them wonderful.

241
00:11:59,427 --> 00:12:03,389
Sometimes all you guys think about
is how you can have the most fun.

242
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:05,433
Exactly!

243
00:12:05,808 --> 00:12:08,352
That was practically my mantra.

244
00:12:09,603 --> 00:12:10,938
What's up, dong bait?

245
00:12:11,063 --> 00:12:12,940
Ha-ha. Drop everything you're doing.

246
00:12:13,023 --> 00:12:16,569
Rihanna is performing in Vegas.
I got tickets. We are road-tripping.

247
00:12:16,944 --> 00:12:18,446
Oh, I can't!

248
00:12:18,696 --> 00:12:22,450
I promised I'd house-sit one more day,
and I have to feed this stupid dog.

249
00:12:22,616 --> 00:12:24,618
I'm sorry, does this dog smoke
blunts topless

250
00:12:24,702 --> 00:12:25,995
on a yacht like a boss?

251
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:28,372
-'Cause that's how Ri-Ri do.
-That's a very good point.

252
00:12:28,539 --> 00:12:31,250
This is floor seats in Vegas for Rihanna.

253
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:36,005
The booze is free there.
Do I really need to keep going?

254
00:12:38,132 --> 00:12:40,885
Okay, this is dinner tonight,
breakfast tomorrow...

255
00:12:41,385 --> 00:12:42,386
I have an idea.

256
00:12:45,055 --> 00:12:46,348
This is in case of emergency.

257
00:12:46,682 --> 00:12:49,894
Do not eat this unless it's an emergency.

258
00:12:50,644 --> 00:12:51,729
Wow.

259
00:12:52,229 --> 00:12:53,564
I'm ready to be a mom.

260
00:13:01,989 --> 00:13:04,033
I'm having trouble
getting this mask to stick.

261
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:07,369
Yes, it's 'cause my
pores are just so small.

262
00:13:07,703 --> 00:13:10,206
There's no way anything
could ever adhere to my skin.

263
00:13:10,372 --> 00:13:11,707
It's a curse, really.

264
00:13:11,957 --> 00:13:15,044
Jianyu, what are your pores like?

265
00:13:17,338 --> 00:13:18,589
[sighing]

266
00:13:19,215 --> 00:13:21,550
Janet, can you show me
to the sauna, please?

267
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:29,141
Dude, she's trying so hard,
and you're giving her nothing!

268
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:32,228
Just pick a fact that you know about her
and just muddle through.

269
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:34,897
She said she likes
impressionist paintings.

270
00:13:35,898 --> 00:13:38,359
Impressionist paintings?
Okay, say no more.

271
00:13:38,692 --> 00:13:40,819
No, no, no, I definitely
feel like I need to say more.

272
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:42,571
Jianyu...

273
00:13:43,113 --> 00:13:47,076
-[chuckling]
-So would you say I helped you today?

274
00:13:47,243 --> 00:13:48,577
Oh, so much.

275
00:13:48,869 --> 00:13:51,247
I had fun,
I didn't think about my problems,

276
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:53,874
and I won this ugly yellow toddler,

277
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:56,126
which is one of the most
beautiful things I've ever seen.

278
00:13:56,252 --> 00:13:57,461
Thank you so much.

279
00:13:57,545 --> 00:13:59,421
All right, I'll see you tomorrow, friend.

280
00:14:10,558 --> 00:14:12,393
You sure this is where
you want to be right now?

281
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:15,980
At the Tea for Two couples cafe?

282
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:17,898
There's no use avoiding it, Chidi.

283
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:19,692
I'm alone.

284
00:14:20,192 --> 00:14:22,611
Jianyu and I have nothing in common.

285
00:14:22,778 --> 00:14:24,446
I just want a soulmate.

286
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:26,031
Someone I can share my passions with,

287
00:14:26,115 --> 00:14:29,368
someone who I can talk to about
the ethereal colors of a Degas.

288
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:30,703
I love Degas.

289
00:14:30,786 --> 00:14:33,873
I took painting lessons as a kid,
and Degas was always my inspiration.

290
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:36,333
And do you like France as much as I do?

291
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:40,713
Well, they enslaved my country
for 300 years. So, no.

292
00:14:40,796 --> 00:14:43,924
-But they have great museums.
-Yes.

293
00:14:44,008 --> 00:14:46,176
Welcome to my cafe, you two.

294
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:49,597
We have a special on soulmate muffins.
Two for the price of zero.

295
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:50,764
Everything is free.

296
00:14:50,848 --> 00:14:52,141
Oh, well, we're not soulmates.

297
00:14:52,224 --> 00:14:53,893
-No. [laughs]
-We're just...

298
00:14:53,976 --> 00:14:56,604
-Soul friends.
-[waitress] Oh.

299
00:14:59,273 --> 00:15:00,274
[Eleanor] Hey, buddy.

300
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:02,860
I have all new fun stuff
for us to do today.

301
00:15:02,943 --> 00:15:04,737
Eleanor, I have huge news.

302
00:15:04,945 --> 00:15:07,698
Not working actually worked.

303
00:15:07,865 --> 00:15:08,991
It did what now?

304
00:15:09,074 --> 00:15:12,036
After our day off,
with a completely clear head,

305
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:16,665
I realized part of what makes humans
so fun is that they're unpredictable.

306
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:19,418
The chaos we've been experiencing

307
00:15:19,501 --> 00:15:22,171
is exactly what would happen if a resident

308
00:15:22,254 --> 00:15:24,089
behaved unpredictably.

309
00:15:24,214 --> 00:15:25,883
The problem in our neighborhood,

310
00:15:25,966 --> 00:15:28,719
it's not a rock or an object.

311
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:30,512
It's one of the people.

312
00:15:30,971 --> 00:15:32,890
Oh! We need to celebrate.

313
00:15:33,265 --> 00:15:35,100
I know, okay...
[exclaims]

314
00:15:35,392 --> 00:15:37,144
Paper clip shower!

315
00:15:37,311 --> 00:15:38,479
[laughing]

316
00:15:40,147 --> 00:15:41,941
So do you think we're looking for a man,

317
00:15:42,024 --> 00:15:44,109
or do you think we're looking for two men?

318
00:15:44,193 --> 00:15:45,569
Not sure.

319
00:15:45,653 --> 00:15:47,446
We don't know anything about this person.

320
00:15:47,529 --> 00:15:52,368
I mean, does he or she even know
that they caused all these problems?

321
00:15:53,077 --> 00:15:54,328
No, that can't be.

322
00:15:54,411 --> 00:15:57,206
I mean, what kind of monster would
wreak havoc and then say nothing?

323
00:15:57,623 --> 00:16:01,126
So this is the main place
where the garbage fell from the sky.

324
00:16:01,418 --> 00:16:03,003
-Janet.
-Hi there.

325
00:16:03,087 --> 00:16:06,298
I need a list of everyone
that was here on garbage duty

326
00:16:06,382 --> 00:16:07,424
during orientation.

327
00:16:08,342 --> 00:16:10,094
Oh...

328
00:16:11,095 --> 00:16:15,015
Eleanor, our criminal
is on this very short list.

329
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:18,102
People were flying that day too.
I'll add everybody who flew overhead.

330
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:19,812
[groans in frustration]

331
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:23,482
Eleanor, our criminal is
on this much longer list.

332
00:16:23,857 --> 00:16:24,733
[sighs]

333
00:16:26,527 --> 00:16:27,611
[engine revving on game]

334
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,030
Oh, hey, homey. Thanks for your advice.

335
00:16:30,114 --> 00:16:31,991
I'm about to give Tahani
the best gift ever.

336
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:33,283
Check it.

337
00:16:35,077 --> 00:16:36,161
What?

338
00:16:36,286 --> 00:16:37,871
She likes impressionist paintings, right?

339
00:16:37,955 --> 00:16:41,333
I got her a painting of the best
impressionist of all time,

340
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:42,459
Frank Caliendo.

341
00:16:42,543 --> 00:16:45,045
He can do it all. Fat Al Pacino,
fat Jerry Seinfeld,

342
00:16:45,129 --> 00:16:45,963
regular John Madden.

343
00:16:46,338 --> 00:16:48,007
"Say hello to my little friend.

344
00:16:48,257 --> 00:16:49,591
Forget about it."

345
00:16:49,883 --> 00:16:52,803
This is where the sinkhole opened up.

346
00:16:52,886 --> 00:16:55,973
And the guest list that night was limited.

347
00:16:56,974 --> 00:16:59,059
There were a total
of 30 people here that night.

348
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:02,604
-[exclaiming in delight]
-Only 30, huh?

349
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:05,524
Yeah! How do you pump your fist again?

350
00:17:06,817 --> 00:17:07,776
Is this it?

351
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:11,071
But, 66 others passed through
to take a look before it opened,

352
00:17:11,155 --> 00:17:14,158
and everyone else in the neighborhood
was in a close radius.

353
00:17:14,241 --> 00:17:18,537
Oh, boy, that...
Doesn't narrow it down at all.

354
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:21,707
Feels like the end of the road.

355
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:25,961
<i>End of the Road,</i> Boyz II Men, karaoke.

356
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:27,671
Let's go. Don't think about it too much.

357
00:17:28,213 --> 00:17:29,381
Janet.

358
00:17:30,007 --> 00:17:31,467
My hoodie, please.

359
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:38,557
-What's happening?
-I give up.

360
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:42,686
I can't help the people
I promised that I would help.

361
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:47,733
I feel like <i>Friends</i> in Season 8,

362
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:52,654
out of ideas and forcing
Joey and Rachel together,

363
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:53,989
even though it made no sense.

364
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:58,869
I hope the sinkhole opens up again
and swallows me whole.

365
00:18:05,501 --> 00:18:09,546
Paula! Hey, girl. How's the dog?

366
00:18:09,713 --> 00:18:12,424
Still fat, Eleanor. Still fat.

367
00:18:13,008 --> 00:18:16,595
The vet says his stomach expanded
to the size of a basketball

368
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,055
and that it will never shrink.

369
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:20,641
Oh, well, that's not my fault.

370
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:24,269
How was I supposed to know he would
literally eat all of the food?

371
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:26,480
It shouldn't have been an issue.

372
00:18:26,563 --> 00:18:29,566
You were supposed to be there,
but you broke your promise

373
00:18:29,733 --> 00:18:35,030
as soon as it wasn't convenient for you,
and now I have a very bulbous dog.

374
00:18:36,031 --> 00:18:38,534
Well, you know what? You're rude.

375
00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:41,954
'Cause you didn't even ask me
how the Rihanna concert was.

376
00:18:42,454 --> 00:18:46,083
She was very late. And a little drunk.

377
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:57,886
I promised to help you, and I will,
however I can.

378
00:18:58,053 --> 00:19:02,850
If you want to look at a million rocks
like a psychopath, I'll be there.

379
00:19:03,058 --> 00:19:05,936
If you want to just lay here
and cry in your hoodie,

380
00:19:06,019 --> 00:19:07,229
I'm cool with that.

381
00:19:07,521 --> 00:19:10,357
Honestly, I don't know how I can help you,

382
00:19:10,774 --> 00:19:14,153
'cause I'm just a person and you're, like,

383
00:19:14,236 --> 00:19:18,323
this super-magical
Orville Redenbacher-type guy

384
00:19:18,407 --> 00:19:23,537
who invented this entire universe,
but I'll do my best.

385
00:19:24,955 --> 00:19:26,123
I'm right here.

386
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:28,292
Oh, my gosh.

387
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:33,797
Of course.

388
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:35,465
How did I not see it?

389
00:19:36,091 --> 00:19:37,217
Janet...

390
00:19:38,468 --> 00:19:41,388
I found the answer to the problem.
Call a neighborhood meeting.

391
00:19:41,597 --> 00:19:45,475
Should it be festive and casual
or moribund and devastating?

392
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:47,436
Moribund and devastating, please.

393
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:48,604
Great!

394
00:19:54,109 --> 00:19:55,819
Hello, Jianyu, Chidi.

395
00:19:58,822 --> 00:20:00,032
What's this?

396
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:02,201
I made you a art.

397
00:20:02,326 --> 00:20:04,161
It's three of me.

398
00:20:05,329 --> 00:20:06,914
It's ballerinas,

399
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:09,291
painted in the style
of the impressionists.

400
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:10,500
Of course.

401
00:20:11,793 --> 00:20:15,505
You don't say things, but you do things.

402
00:20:15,672 --> 00:20:18,008
And you feel things.

403
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:22,888
Only my true soulmate could ever give
me such a perfect gift.

404
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:24,306
Thank you!

405
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:31,313
[indistinct chattering]

406
00:20:32,439 --> 00:20:33,815
What's going on?

407
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:35,317
Well, I did what you said.

408
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:38,278
I honored my agreement to help Michael

409
00:20:38,362 --> 00:20:42,449
{\an8}find the problem,
and he found the problem.

410
00:20:42,616 --> 00:20:43,700
{\an8}Oh, I'm so sorry.

411
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:47,162
{\an8}After I'm gone, take down
the rest of those clown paintings.

412
00:20:47,496 --> 00:20:50,165
{\an8}But leave up the sexy mailman.

413
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:52,084
{\an8}To remember me by.

414
00:20:53,335 --> 00:20:56,505
{\an8}Thank you all for your patience
with the problems in our neighborhood.

415
00:20:57,214 --> 00:20:59,466
{\an8}I have finally discovered the cause.

416
00:21:00,592 --> 00:21:03,720
{\an8}There was one common
link among every incident.

417
00:21:04,346 --> 00:21:06,932
{\an8}And when I figured it out, it was a shock.

418
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:08,642
{\an8}But there's no escaping it.

419
00:21:10,394 --> 00:21:11,645
{\an8}The problem...

420
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:13,772
{\an8}Is me.

421
00:21:13,897 --> 00:21:15,524
[all gasping]

422
00:21:15,732 --> 00:21:18,485
{\an8}And now, I have to leave you...

423
00:21:18,568 --> 00:21:19,736
{\an8}Forever.
