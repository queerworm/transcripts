00:00:03,461 --> 00:00:05,755
Wow! [exclaims]

2
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:08,258
Janet, you did it!
You brought us into your void!

3
00:00:08,341 --> 00:00:10,176
If I had a heart, it would be pounding.

4
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:13,138
-Michael--
-You'd think there'd be side effects,

5
00:00:13,221 --> 00:00:14,305
but I feel great.

6
00:00:14,389 --> 00:00:16,224
How's the hair?
Is it still amazing?

7
00:00:16,307 --> 00:00:19,686
Michael, there may have been
some side effects for the humans.

8
00:00:21,771 --> 00:00:22,605
Huh.

9
00:00:24,065 --> 00:00:27,610
Dude, why are there so many Janets?
And why do I sound like Janet?

10
00:00:27,694 --> 00:00:29,904
You also look like Janet.

11
00:00:29,988 --> 00:00:33,324
Do I? Why? What?

12
00:00:34,117 --> 00:00:37,245
What is happening? [grunts]

13
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:41,916
Oh, no. Am I wearing a vest?

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,294
Oh! Michael, help me!

15
00:00:44,377 --> 00:00:47,338
This is gonna be tricky.
How do we even tell them apart?

16
00:00:47,422 --> 00:00:50,091
Oh! [laughs]

17
00:00:50,175 --> 00:00:52,343
Okay, that one's Jason.

18
00:00:59,017 --> 00:01:01,019
I can't put the humans
back in their own bodies,

19
00:01:01,102 --> 00:01:05,106
{\an8}so I've done the next best,
but still not that great, thing.

20
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:09,235
{\an8}A high-neck sleeveless?
I suppose this outfit will do.

21
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:10,487
{\an8}Are you sure?

22
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:13,573
{\an8}I mean, wearing a floral print
to an infinite void

23
00:01:13,656 --> 00:01:15,909
{\an8}at this time of the nothing?

24
00:01:15,992 --> 00:01:19,370
{\an8}So where are we exactly?
We're not on Earth, right?

25
00:01:19,454 --> 00:01:21,289
{\an8}That's correct, Chidi-Janet. You're not.

26
00:01:21,372 --> 00:01:24,334
{\an8}Your real bodies dematerialized
when you entered my void,

27
00:01:24,417 --> 00:01:28,338
{\an8}and your essences reconstituted themselves
in this form.

28
00:01:28,421 --> 00:01:31,758
{\an8}Cool, cool. And when you say "void"...

29
00:01:31,841 --> 00:01:34,302
{\an8}Oh, I mean a subdimension
outside of space and time,

30
00:01:34,385 --> 00:01:38,973
{\an8}at the nexus of consciousness and matter,
tethered to my essence. Does that help?

31
00:01:39,057 --> 00:01:41,851
{\an8}It does not help. Makes it way worse.

32
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:46,898
{\an8}I just wanna lie down. Where is down?

33
00:01:46,981 --> 00:01:50,401
{\an8}I found it. It's up here. It's dope!

34
00:01:50,985 --> 00:01:52,570
{\an8}I have an idea.

35
00:01:53,154 --> 00:01:54,364
{\an8}[Janet] Sweet! I call sofa.

36
00:01:54,447 --> 00:01:57,408
{\an8}[Michael] Janet's void has a back door
to the Janet Warehouse

37
00:01:57,492 --> 00:02:00,703
{\an8}in the Neutral Zone,
which is right near Accounting.

38
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:05,375
{\an8}You four will stay here
while actual Janet and I sneak through it

39
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:06,751
and find the Head Accountant.

40
00:02:06,835 --> 00:02:09,420
But, Michael, why can't we go with you?

41
00:02:09,504 --> 00:02:12,048
Well, you just died, which means
you're the first humans in history

42
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:14,342
to not immediately go
to the Good or Bad Place,

43
00:02:14,425 --> 00:02:17,846
which, in turn,
makes you interdimensional fugitives.

44
00:02:17,929 --> 00:02:19,389
So, that's neat.

45
00:02:19,472 --> 00:02:21,224
Also, the Judge is probably
still pissed at me,

46
00:02:21,307 --> 00:02:25,061
for, you know, breaking all the rules
and she might take it out on you.

47
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:28,022
Plus, the Bad Place
is probably hunting for us.

48
00:02:28,106 --> 00:02:31,192
So, literally,
the entire universe is against you.

49
00:02:31,276 --> 00:02:33,069
Okay, but what's a fourth
really good reason?

50
00:02:34,404 --> 00:02:37,657
Jeez. Just trying to lighten the mood.
Tough void.

51
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:40,577
Now, Janet and I will pose
as Good Place employees,

52
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:43,121
and sweet talk the Accountant
into showing us his books.

53
00:02:43,204 --> 00:02:46,624
If I'm right, we will find proof

54
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:49,752
that the Bad Place
is tampering with the points system.

55
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:52,630
The Accountant will tell us what to do
and this will all be over.

56
00:02:52,714 --> 00:02:54,591
We're almost at the end, guys.

57
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:58,177
Just stay here
and keep Janet's heads on straight.

58
00:02:58,261 --> 00:02:59,262
[Janet] Bye!

59
00:03:02,932 --> 00:03:06,019
-Is that a Good Janet or a Bad Janet?
-That's a Neutral Janet.

60
00:03:06,102 --> 00:03:08,479
She's sort of the black sheep
of the Janet world.

61
00:03:08,563 --> 00:03:10,440
Or blank sheep, I guess.

62
00:03:10,523 --> 00:03:13,067
Ooh! I can throw shade now. That's cool.

63
00:03:14,652 --> 00:03:16,321
You've arrived at the Accounting office.

64
00:03:16,404 --> 00:03:19,699
All point calculations for actions
taken on Earth are made here.

65
00:03:19,782 --> 00:03:22,285
-End of conversation.
-My name is Michael.

66
00:03:22,368 --> 00:03:25,788
I need to speak with the Head Accountant
on official Good Place business.

67
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:28,124
I will inform the Head Accountant
of your presence,

68
00:03:28,207 --> 00:03:31,294
and he either will or will not see you
in a certain amount of time.

69
00:03:31,377 --> 00:03:33,129
End of conversation.

70
00:03:33,212 --> 00:03:34,047
Wow!

71
00:03:37,258 --> 00:03:39,636
{\an8}Good thing your void plan worked out, huh?

72
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:42,472

Mmm.

75
00:03:47,352 --> 00:03:49,687
Having four humans in my void is weird.

76
00:03:49,771 --> 00:03:51,022
-Ah.
-[Janet sighs]

77
00:03:51,105 --> 00:03:55,693
This is nuts. We're in a void
in the body of a white lady--

78
00:03:55,777 --> 00:03:57,111
-Not a lady.
-Not a lady, darling.

79
00:03:57,195 --> 00:04:00,031
But we are white.
Let's all say white people things.

80
00:04:00,114 --> 00:04:02,575
"Billy Joel." "I found it on Etsy."

81
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:05,495
"There was nowhere to park!"
"Did you refill the Brita?"

82
00:04:05,578 --> 00:04:11,209
I find this void quite calming, actually.
It's like, this time, the Xanax took me.

83
00:04:11,292 --> 00:04:12,710
Oh, I have the worst stomachache.

84
00:04:12,794 --> 00:04:17,048
Dude, relax.
Here, let me see if I can figure this out.

85
00:04:18,758 --> 00:04:20,885
Oh! Wow!

86
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:23,471
-Eleanor, how'd you do that?
-[Eleanor-Janet] I don't know.

87
00:04:23,554 --> 00:04:26,266
We're Janets now. So, I thought
we'd have some bitchin' Janet powers.

88
00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:28,601
What just happened?
What did you do?

89
00:04:28,685 --> 00:04:30,812
Sorry, I’m just trying
to help Chidi calm--

90
00:04:30,895 --> 00:04:33,439
The structural integrity of this void
is already at risk.

91
00:04:33,523 --> 00:04:35,775
You can't start
randomly conjuring up objects,

92
00:04:35,858 --> 00:04:39,195
or it might shatter the void.
Yes, it might.

93
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:42,532
It might make everything blow up
and we'll all disappear forever.

94
00:04:43,324 --> 00:04:44,826
So, stop it!

95
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:51,624
-Everything okay?
-Nope.

96
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:52,542
Well...

97
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:54,377
[Neutral Janet] The Head Accountant
has decided to see you.

98
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:57,130
This will happen now. End of conversation.

99
00:04:58,298 --> 00:04:59,173
Hi.

100
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:04,053
Heyo! There they are. Good to see you.
Sorry to keep you waiting.

101
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:07,432
{\an8}I'm Neil, Head Accountant.
You must be Janet and Michael.

102
00:05:07,515 --> 00:05:08,975
-Yes.
-[Neil] Can I just say,

103
00:05:09,058 --> 00:05:11,602
I really depreciate you coming.

104
00:05:12,437 --> 00:05:14,731
Uh? Little bit of accounting humor.

105
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:17,233
-[chuckles]
-Yeah. So, what can I do for you?

106
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:21,571
Well, I'm concerned about
certain anomalies in the points system.

107
00:05:21,654 --> 00:05:25,366
I'm worried that somehow
the Bad Place has been tampering.

108
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:28,911
Tampering? No, no.
Quite impossible. Laughable, really.

109
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:31,080
Janet, can you remind me
to laugh at that later?

110
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:34,625
Your amusement has been scheduled.
End of conversation.

111
00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:36,794
She's a lot of fun.

112
00:05:36,878 --> 00:05:40,423
Could you just humor us, though?
Show us how the system works.

113
00:05:41,132 --> 00:05:43,843
Ah! Well, I suppose
I could give you a quick tour.

114
00:05:43,926 --> 00:05:46,220
We don't get a lot of visitors. Follow me.

115
00:05:47,388 --> 00:05:51,267
Eleanor, how'd you know
I always wanted a dog like this?

116
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:55,354
Funny story, it's one of the things
I saw in the alternate timeline

117
00:05:55,438 --> 00:05:59,025
where we were soulmates
on and off for 300 years.

118
00:06:00,234 --> 00:06:01,944
Maybe we should talk about that?

119
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:05,907
Well, I suppose we can,
but there's not that much to talk about.

120
00:06:06,491 --> 00:06:08,993
The things you saw
weren't part of my life,

121
00:06:09,077 --> 00:06:10,203
so they didn't happen to me.

122
00:06:10,286 --> 00:06:13,539
What the hell are you talking about?
Of course it was you. I saw it.

123
00:06:13,623 --> 00:06:17,210
Well, it was a Chidi, sure,
but it wasn't me Chidi.

124
00:06:17,293 --> 00:06:19,003
This is a classic philosophical question,

the concept of the self,
or who we are.

126
00:06:21,422 --> 00:06:22,757
Philosophically speaking,

127
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:26,177
there's the Chidi I am,
who lived a certain life,

128
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:30,598
and there's the Chidi you saw,
your soulmate or whatever,

129
00:06:30,681 --> 00:06:34,560
who had some entirely different life.
Not the same Chidis.

130
00:06:34,644 --> 00:06:37,146
[chuckles] I'm so sorry.
Yeah, no, I get it.

131
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:40,024
Counterpoint, that's the dumbest thing
you've ever said,

132
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:42,318

Things are getting cuter
and I want them to get less cute!

136
00:06:54,163 --> 00:06:56,332
{\an8}So, this is the main feed.

137
00:06:56,415 --> 00:06:59,669
Every action
by every human on Earth is recorded,

138
00:06:59,752 --> 00:07:02,338
and then sent here
to be assigned a point value

139
00:07:02,421 --> 00:07:04,924
based on the absolute moral worth
of that action.

140
00:07:05,007 --> 00:07:07,301
For example, a couple in Ōsaka, Japan,

141
00:07:07,385 --> 00:07:09,512
just decided
to have a destination wedding.

142
00:07:09,595 --> 00:07:11,264
Negative 1,200 points.

143
00:07:12,348 --> 00:07:15,893
And it's a destination theme wedding.
Negative 4,300.

144
00:07:17,395 --> 00:07:20,189
The theme's <i>Lord of the Rings.</i>
They're basically doomed.

145
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:23,943
Oh! Here's fun. This means that someone
has just done something

146
00:07:24,026 --> 00:07:25,403
which has never been done before.

147
00:07:25,987 --> 00:07:30,116
Richard Moore of Sugar Land, Texas,
hollowed out an eggplant

148
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:32,994
and filled it with hot sauce and nickels.

149
00:07:33,077 --> 00:07:35,496
And, amazingly,
it's not a weird sex thing.

150
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:39,125
99% of all new human behaviors
are weird sex things, but not in this--

151
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:41,752
Oh, no, it is a weird sex thing. Yeah.

152
00:07:41,836 --> 00:07:43,838
Well, then we zip that over
to the relevant departments.

153
00:07:43,921 --> 00:07:46,924
In this case, Anastasia
in the Stuffed Vegetable Department.

154
00:07:47,008 --> 00:07:48,885
We've got Hector over in American Coins,

155
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:51,262
and my dear buddy, Matt,
in Weird Sex Things.

156
00:07:51,345 --> 00:07:53,181
{\an8}I'm still waiting on a response

157

for immediate suicide.

{\an8}Request denied. I love Matty.
He's hilarious.

159
00:07:59,395 --> 00:08:01,856
So, they now examine the action,

160
00:08:01,939 --> 00:08:05,526
its use of resources,
the intentions behind it,

161
00:08:06,235 --> 00:08:07,445

-And here is why tampering is impossible.
-[printer whirring]

164
00:08:13,117 --> 00:08:17,288
Because this score is then double-checked
by three billion other accountants,

00:08:17,371 --> 00:08:18,498
all chosen at random,

166
00:08:18,581 --> 00:08:20,666
and if they come to the same conclusion,

167
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:23,586
which they always do,
it makes this official.

168
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:27,465
{\an8}Anyone who does the same action
the same way loses this many points.

169
00:08:27,548 --> 00:08:29,800
When people die,
their biographical history

170
00:08:29,884 --> 00:08:32,929
and final point totals
are sent to the relevant destination.

171
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:35,014
This batch is going to the Bad Place.

172
00:08:35,973 --> 00:08:36,807
Thank you, Doris.

173
00:08:38,935 --> 00:08:39,936
The system is flawless

174
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:42,188
-and tampering is quite impossible.
-[Michael] I see.

175
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:46,692
Could we look at one specific file,
though, just to make sure?

176
00:08:46,776 --> 00:08:50,363
Oh. Who do you wanna see?
Genghis Khan? Marie-Antoinette?

177
00:08:50,446 --> 00:08:52,573
Walt Disney's got some freaky stuff
in his file.

178
00:08:53,824 --> 00:08:55,284
Doug Forcett.

179
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:58,329
I don't get this, man.

180
00:08:58,412 --> 00:09:00,331
Why wouldn't you want to know
what our life was like?

181
00:09:00,414 --> 00:09:03,876
You're not even a little bit curious
what it was like to hit this?

182
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,419
I don't mean this-this.

183
00:09:05,503 --> 00:09:08,422
Although, frankly,
I would also hit this-this.

184
00:09:08,506 --> 00:09:09,715
I don't want to see those memories

185
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:13,386
because, philosophically speaking,
they're none of my business.

186
00:09:13,469 --> 00:09:17,014
They happened to someone else.
Let me explain.

187
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:19,058
Take a seat.

188
00:09:19,141 --> 00:09:21,435
"Conceptions of the Self."

189
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:24,981
Let's start with John Locke,
who believed that personal identity

190
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:27,942
was based on having
a continued consciousness.

191
00:09:28,025 --> 00:09:29,610
Essentially, memory.

192
00:09:29,694 --> 00:09:34,490
Memories are links in a chain
that together form a single self.

193
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:36,534
If I can't remember what happened,

194
00:09:36,617 --> 00:09:39,620
because it happened to a Chidi
from another timeline,

195
00:09:39,704 --> 00:09:41,622
it's not a unified me.

196
00:09:41,706 --> 00:09:43,249
Just because
you don't remember doing something

197
00:09:43,332 --> 00:09:44,584
doesn't mean you didn't do it.

198
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:46,544
I have no idea how it happened,

199
00:09:46,627 --> 00:09:50,590
but there is definitely a tattoo
on my butt that says "Jasom."

200
00:09:50,673 --> 00:09:52,091
That brings us to Derek Parfit.

201
00:09:52,174 --> 00:09:53,426
It does?

202
00:09:53,509 --> 00:09:56,929
Parfit said, "Even if I have memories
from an earlier time,

203
00:09:57,013 --> 00:09:59,640
that doesn't necessarily mean it was me."

204
00:09:59,724 --> 00:10:02,018
After all, if my brain was split in two

205
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:04,186
and each half
was put in a different person,

206
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:06,188
which one is me?

207
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:09,525
All I know is
that other Chidi doesn't exist anymore,

208
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:13,571
and this one does,
so this must be the real Chidi.

209
00:10:13,654 --> 00:10:17,074
And all I know is that you're just
barfing Wikipedia all over everyone

210
00:10:17,158 --> 00:10:19,493
to avoid talking about your feelings.

211
00:10:20,745 --> 00:10:22,705
Let's talk about David Hume.

212
00:10:22,788 --> 00:10:24,165
[Neil] Hmm.

213
00:10:25,249 --> 00:10:29,337
Here we go, the Book of Dougs.
Let's have us a look.

214
00:10:31,547 --> 00:10:35,843
Doug Forbush... Forcap... Doug L. Forcett.

215
00:10:36,677 --> 00:10:39,013
Hey, no peeking. Accountants only.

216
00:10:39,096 --> 00:10:41,515
Can you just tell me his total so far?

217
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:45,478
Looks like he's at 520,000 points.

218
00:10:45,561 --> 00:10:47,897
-Well done, Doug.
-So, that's good?

219
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:50,024
Oh, it's excellent.

220
00:10:50,107 --> 00:10:53,903
Wait. He's 68 years old?
That's terrible. He's screwed.

221
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:55,154
[Michael] I knew it!

222
00:10:55,237 --> 00:10:59,200
Doug has spent his entire life
being nothing but good.

223
00:10:59,283 --> 00:11:03,329
He once found a dollar on the ground
and he sent it to the Canadian government

224
00:11:03,412 --> 00:11:05,623
to help pay down their national debt,

225
00:11:05,706 --> 00:11:09,168
and he isn't even close to getting in?
How can that be?

226
00:11:09,251 --> 00:11:12,963
Look, mate, the points are indisputable.
They have been since the beginning.

227
00:11:13,047 --> 00:11:15,591
{\an8}"Og gives his rock to Grog."

228
00:11:15,674 --> 00:11:18,928
First ever act of human altruism.
Og earned 10,000 points that day.

229
00:11:19,011 --> 00:11:20,638
'Course, then Grog used that rock

230
00:11:20,721 --> 00:11:23,140
{\an8}to beat Og's brains in
and lost a million points.

231
00:11:23,224 --> 00:11:26,852
{\an8}Point is, the math
is cold, objective and airtight.

232
00:11:26,936 --> 00:11:29,939
And unless you can prove otherwise,
I don't know how I can help you.

233
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:33,901
I just got 700 new Weird Sex Thing files
in the last one second.

234
00:11:33,984 --> 00:11:36,153
Oh, yeah, Burning Man just started.

235
00:11:36,237 --> 00:11:38,823
Buckle up, Matty!
It's going to be a long week.

236
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:44,453
So, in essence, Hume thought
that we don't truly have a self.

237
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:47,957
We're just a bundle
of our ever-changing impressions.

238
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:48,999
Just admit it, man.

239
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:51,794
You're embarrassed you fell in love
with an Arizona trash bag.

240
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:53,921
Eleanor, it's not personal.

241
00:11:54,004 --> 00:11:57,174
Someone fell in love with you.
It's just not me.

242
00:11:57,758 --> 00:11:59,135
I told you not to conjure anything!

243
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:02,680
Sorry. I just swapped the living room
for a classroom.

244
00:12:02,763 --> 00:12:04,306
Not you, him.

245
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:06,934
-Jason, what is wrong with you?
-Sorry, Janet.

246
00:12:07,017 --> 00:12:08,853
I didn't mean to conjure Pillboi.

247
00:12:08,936 --> 00:12:11,272
I was just thinking
about how much fun we used to have,

248
00:12:11,355 --> 00:12:14,942
hanging out in his broken hot tub
and then he showed up.

249
00:12:15,025 --> 00:12:19,155
Yeah, I was just chillin' being nothing.
Then, all of a sudden, I was.

250
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:20,156
-[Jason-Janet exclaims]
-[Pillboi chuckles]

251
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:21,240
Goodbye, Pillboi.

252
00:12:21,323 --> 00:12:25,202
Ah, dip, I'm not again...

253
00:12:25,286 --> 00:12:26,370
Oh...

254
00:12:27,246 --> 00:12:28,080
You need to hurry.

255
00:12:28,164 --> 00:12:33,169
My molecular essence is fragmenting
and it's giving me the worst headache.

256
00:12:33,752 --> 00:12:37,590
Okay, here's a question,
if Doug Forcett's not getting in, who is?

257
00:12:37,673 --> 00:12:39,216
Let's look at one more file.

258
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:41,802
Someone who's gotten into the Good Place
this year.

259
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:44,305
All right. Why don't we look at...

260
00:12:45,347 --> 00:12:46,807
No one. No one got in.

261
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,686
-No one's gotten in for a year?
-Correct.

262
00:12:50,769 --> 00:12:52,146
How about the last three years?

263
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:55,191
All right. Uh... [scatting]

264
00:12:58,486 --> 00:13:00,029
Ah... No one.

265
00:13:01,071 --> 00:13:03,032
When was the last time someone got in?

266
00:13:03,824 --> 00:13:07,661
[Neil] The last time someone got enough
points to get into the Good Place was...

267
00:13:07,745 --> 00:13:09,747
521 years ago.

268
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,001
Michael... Um...

269
00:13:16,086 --> 00:13:17,713
Yo, homie.

270
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:22,009
You and Eleanor were fighting before
and I couldn't help but overhear.

271
00:13:22,551 --> 00:13:27,848
Hey, if we hear with our ears,
why is it called "butt overhearing"?

272
00:13:28,432 --> 00:13:32,186
Bro, if you don't like her,
you should just tell her.

273
00:13:32,269 --> 00:13:36,065
[sighs] It's not about whether
I like Eleanor.

274
00:13:36,148 --> 00:13:37,566
I got into philosophy

275
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:40,778
to try to make sense of a world
that almost never makes sense,

276
00:13:40,861 --> 00:13:44,240
and that was before I learned that I died,

277
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:48,077
and then un-died and then re-died.

278
00:13:48,619 --> 00:13:51,914
I just can't take one more thing.
It's too much.

279
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:55,751
I'm gonna tell you a story.
Back in Jacksonville,

280
00:13:55,834 --> 00:13:59,755
there was this guy in my 80-person
dance crew named Stank Toby--

281
00:13:59,838 --> 00:14:03,342
Hang on. It was a 60-person dance crew.

282
00:14:03,425 --> 00:14:04,343
Um...

283
00:14:05,135 --> 00:14:08,389
Oh, dip! What are numbers?

284
00:14:08,472 --> 00:14:10,849
You're not Jason-Janet.

285
00:14:10,933 --> 00:14:14,311
You're Eleanor-Janet pretending
to be Jason-Janet.

286
00:14:14,395 --> 00:14:18,232
That is so wrong and so confusing!

287
00:14:18,315 --> 00:14:20,442
What was I supposed to do, man?

288
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:22,945
You wouldn't talk to me.
This seemed like the only option.

289
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:26,740
[imitates Eleanor] Hi, Chidi, I'm Eleanor.
I'm Arizona shrimp horny!

290
00:14:26,824 --> 00:14:29,994
That's not what I sound like, Jason.
Get out of here!

291
00:14:30,077 --> 00:14:30,911
Oh, dip.

292
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:34,081
Look, you know what? Just forget it!

293
00:14:34,164 --> 00:14:37,126
What am I even doing?
I'm chasing a dude who isn't into me.

294
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:39,712
I'm making myself vulnerable
for no reason.

295
00:14:39,795 --> 00:14:41,922
I don't even know who I am anymore.

296
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:44,341
Uh-oh.

297
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:45,968
This is new.

298
00:14:46,051 --> 00:14:51,015
I'm so annoyed at myself!
[scoffs] Stupid Eleanor! Stupid!

299
00:14:52,099 --> 00:14:55,644
-This whole thing sucks, you know?
-Eleanor, you're not--

300
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:58,647
The one thing I never wanted to do, ever,
for any reason,

301
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:01,191
was to follow some guy around
like a lame puppy dog.

302
00:15:01,275 --> 00:15:03,319
I mean, look at me.
I don't need to do that.

303
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:04,987
I can get any guy I want.

304
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:06,655
Eleanor, just... Hang on.

305
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:08,949
What, dude? What? What do you want?

306
00:15:09,533 --> 00:15:10,451
What is going on?

307
00:15:11,201 --> 00:15:14,121
Okay, well, this is bad.

308
00:15:14,204 --> 00:15:17,750
Why are you staring at me?
Do I have a zit on my nose or something?

309
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:21,170
Your sense of self is crumbling
and it's taking the void down with it.

310
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:25,466
Great. So, I don't feel like myself for
two seconds and it breaks the universe?

311
00:15:25,549 --> 00:15:26,675
How come nothing went wrong

312
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:29,887
when Chidi freaked out about his identity
for three hours?

313
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:33,807
Because freaking out about everything
is my identity. Not to brag.

314
00:15:33,891 --> 00:15:35,601
I need you to hold it together.

315
00:15:35,684 --> 00:15:38,687
Try to do something Eleanor-y.
Laugh at someone who falls down

316
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:42,316
or show up at an event underdressed
and get mad at everyone else somehow.

317
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:43,317
I'll be right back.

318
00:15:44,193 --> 00:15:45,819
[distant explosion]

319
00:15:47,655 --> 00:15:49,949
I know I asked you this before, but--

320
00:15:50,032 --> 00:15:53,035
No, darling. This is not
where the Mac and PC guys live.

321
00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:57,748
Whoa! Check out this dope flat screen.
It's air-mounted!

322
00:15:58,332 --> 00:15:59,375
Do you see this, Tahani?

323
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:02,628
[Tahani-Janet] This must be where
Janet stores all her information.

324
00:16:02,711 --> 00:16:07,549
This screen can literally show us anything
that has ever happened.

325
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:09,301
Cartoons! Cartoons!

326
00:16:09,885 --> 00:16:13,639
I think it's broken.
TV, play cartoons for Jason.

327
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:18,644
Oh, my. Janet has a crush on you.

328
00:16:18,727 --> 00:16:22,064
I'm sorry. It's not just a crush.

329
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:27,403
I think, in one of the reboots,
you and Janet were married.

330
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:29,071
Whoa! Married?

331
00:16:29,154 --> 00:16:30,572
Oh...

332
00:16:31,198 --> 00:16:34,576
This flat screen
must have been a wedding present.

333
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:36,704
It's all starting to make sense now.

334
00:16:37,746 --> 00:16:38,622
Well, I've gotta run.

335
00:16:38,706 --> 00:16:42,126
We're having a little thing
in the break room for Marisol's birthday.

336
00:16:42,209 --> 00:16:46,296
She's turning 39 million again.
So, if there's nothing else...

337
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:49,883
"If there's nothing else"?
Neil, be logical.

338
00:16:49,967 --> 00:16:53,679
Not one Good Place resident
in over 500 years?

339
00:16:54,388 --> 00:16:57,057
Not Jonas Salk? Not Harriet Tubman?

340
00:16:57,141 --> 00:16:59,893
Not one single Golden Girl?

341
00:16:59,977 --> 00:17:03,105
The Bad Place has hacked your system!

342
00:17:03,188 --> 00:17:05,524
No, it hasn't. How dare you?

343
00:17:05,607 --> 00:17:08,110
Frankly, I'm beginning to resent
your tone, sir. If you've got a problem,

344
00:17:08,193 --> 00:17:09,945
then go to the Good Place
and take it up with the Committee.

345
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:12,322
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have to get to the break room,

346
00:17:12,406 --> 00:17:15,034
because there's cake over there,
and if I don't move quickly,

347
00:17:15,117 --> 00:17:17,703
Erika will get the last corner piece!
Good day, sir.

348
00:17:17,786 --> 00:17:20,164
[Michael] Oh, no, no,
this can't be happening.

349
00:17:20,247 --> 00:17:24,960
No, he was supposed to tell us what to do.
If he's not gonna fix this, who is?

350
00:17:26,462 --> 00:17:27,296
You, Michael.

351
00:17:28,255 --> 00:17:29,840
It has to be you.

352
00:17:29,923 --> 00:17:31,967
We keep wandering
around these different realms,

353
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:35,345
expecting someone else to have the answer,
but no one ever does.

354
00:17:35,429 --> 00:17:36,764
You're the guy, Michael.

355
00:17:36,847 --> 00:17:40,059
You're the only one who can fix
whatever's wrong with the afterlife.

356
00:17:40,142 --> 00:17:41,602
But before we get into that,

357
00:17:41,685 --> 00:17:45,022
Eleanor's identity is shattering
inside my void, and I might blow up,

358
00:17:45,105 --> 00:17:48,525
so I'm gonna need you to grab a paper clip
and marbleize me, like, yesterday.

359
00:17:48,609 --> 00:17:50,277
-What's gonna happen to the humans?
-[Janet] No idea,

360
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:52,529
but I can't take them out of my void
in the middle of this office.

361
00:17:52,613 --> 00:17:55,032
And if we do nothing, everyone is gone-zo.

362
00:17:55,115 --> 00:17:58,160
Marbleize me, get us somewhere safe
and bring me back.

363
00:17:58,243 --> 00:18:02,414
Right. Paper clip! I need a paper clip!
Hey, Matt! Do you have a paper clip?

364
00:18:02,998 --> 00:18:04,625
What are you gonna use it for?

365
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:07,086
-Chidi, I'm scared.
-I know.

366
00:18:07,169 --> 00:18:09,671
What am I supposed to be doing right now?
I don't remember.

367
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:12,132
I'm having a hard time remembering.

368
00:18:13,383 --> 00:18:17,429
Right. Memories.
You need to remember who you are.

369
00:18:17,513 --> 00:18:21,058
You're Eleanor Shellstrop
from Phoenix, Arizona.

370
00:18:21,141 --> 00:18:23,185
Your favorite meal is shrimp scampi.

371
00:18:23,268 --> 00:18:25,479
You listed your emergency contact
as Britney Spears

372
00:18:25,562 --> 00:18:27,356
as a long-shot way of meeting her,

373
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:31,276
and your favorite movie is that clip
of John Travolta saying "Adele Dazeem."

374
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:33,403
You flew halfway around the world

375
00:18:33,487 --> 00:18:37,491
because you wanted to be a better person,
and it was very brave.

376
00:18:37,574 --> 00:18:40,410
You're sharp and you're strong.

377
00:18:40,494 --> 00:18:42,412
You make fun of me a lot.

378
00:18:42,496 --> 00:18:44,373
You once called me a human snooze button,

379
00:18:44,456 --> 00:18:46,166
but you also showed up in my classroom

380
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:49,044
when I was drowning
in despair and canned chili,

381
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:51,797
and you basically saved my life.

382
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,715
You have very high self-esteem,

383
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:57,636
and a very low tolerance
for men who wear sandals,

384
00:18:57,719 --> 00:18:59,930
and your worst nightmare

385
00:19:00,013 --> 00:19:03,308
is someone saying
something nice about you to your face,

386
00:19:03,392 --> 00:19:07,521
but too bad, because I need to say it,
because you deserve it.

387
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:10,899
-Because... Because...
-Chidi...

388
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:27,374
-[Chidi sighs]
-[Eleanor panting]

389
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:29,501
[chuckles]

390
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:31,503
Nice work, bud.

391
00:19:33,046 --> 00:19:34,590
Did you mean everything you said

392
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:38,468
or did you just say it
because the world was ending?

393
00:19:40,137 --> 00:19:42,055
I really wanna play this cool,

394
00:19:42,139 --> 00:19:47,060
but I'm afraid that I'm gonna ruin it
if I try to be sexy.

395
00:19:49,479 --> 00:19:51,148
I already ruined it. Um...

396
00:19:51,732 --> 00:19:54,443
Saying the word "sexy" is not sexy.

397
00:19:57,988 --> 00:19:59,531
-Wait!
-Oh! Jeez.

398
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:00,490
I'm okay.

399
00:20:01,074 --> 00:20:02,826
-Are you sure?
-Yes. I'm okay.

400
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:04,536
Wait. Uh-oh. Ooh.

401
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:05,579
What?

402
00:20:05,662 --> 00:20:08,916
They're not Janets anymore.
They're them and they're not sitting well.

403
00:20:08,999 --> 00:20:11,168
[exhales] Incoming.

404
00:20:15,464 --> 00:20:17,674
They're all here, and they're safe...

405
00:20:17,758 --> 00:20:19,968
-[all chuckling]
-[alarm blaring]

406
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:21,595
...from the old scary thing.

407
00:20:21,678 --> 00:20:23,513
Now, there's a new scary thing.

408
00:20:25,557 --> 00:20:27,851
Hi, guys. I'm Neil. Welcome to Accounting.

409
00:20:27,935 --> 00:20:31,271
Now, it does seem that four of you
are interdimensional fugitives,

410
00:20:31,355 --> 00:20:33,815
so I did go ahead and hit the alarm.
Sorry about that.

411
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:36,318
But there is some good news.
There's some cake left.

412
00:20:36,401 --> 00:20:37,444
Yes!

413
00:20:37,527 --> 00:20:39,279
Michael, what are we going to do?

414
00:20:39,363 --> 00:20:42,324
Guys, I'm so sorry.
The Accountant was no help.

415
00:20:42,407 --> 00:20:43,367
Rude.

416
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:46,328
No one's gotten into the Good Place
in 500 years.

417
00:20:46,411 --> 00:20:50,123
We have no plan.
No one's coming to save us.

418
00:20:53,752 --> 00:20:55,337
So...

419
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:00,342
I'm gonna do it.

420
00:21:03,553 --> 00:21:05,430
{\an8}-Follow me!
-[all exclaim]

421
00:21:05,514 --> 00:21:08,558
{\an8}The corner piece! No!

422
00:21:11,895 --> 00:21:14,773
{\an8}You can't take the Book of Dougs.
Accountants only!

423
00:21:14,856 --> 00:21:18,986
{\an8}I need one of you to volunteer
to do something outrageously insane

424
00:21:19,069 --> 00:21:22,406
{\an8}that will either make you cease to exist
or be really fun.

425
00:21:22,489 --> 00:21:23,573
{\an8}That's most of the things I've tried!

426
00:21:23,657 --> 00:21:25,826
{\an8}That's my guy. Come here. Get in the tube!

427
00:21:25,909 --> 00:21:27,828
{\an8}Oh, hell, yeah. I love getting in stuff!

428
00:21:31,415 --> 00:21:33,375
{\an8}-[Michael sighs]
-[alarm continues to beep]

429
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:34,293
{\an8}[Tahani exclaims]

430
00:21:36,336 --> 00:21:38,255
No way to know what happened to him.
So, come on, let's go.

431
00:21:38,338 --> 00:21:41,591
Everyone else, come up. Here you go.

432
00:21:44,177 --> 00:21:48,307
-[all shouting indistinctly]
-[thudding]

433
00:21:53,562 --> 00:21:56,231
That was awesome! That was awesome!
I want to go again.

434
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:59,318
[all panting]

435
00:21:59,401 --> 00:22:00,610
Where are we?

436
00:22:02,112 --> 00:22:03,405
We're in the Good Place.

437
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:06,074
No offense, dude,
but you have told us a lot of lies

438
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:09,870
in the last 300 years,
so seriously, where the fork are we?

439
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:15,042
Fork. Shirt. Ashhole.

440
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:16,084
[gasps]

441
00:22:17,627 --> 00:22:22,257
Holy forking shirtballs.
We're in the Good Place.
