Would you like a magic guitar

-So, ultimately,

22
00:01:11,279 --> 00:01:14,449
this all goes back to the line
from Professor May's book,

23
00:01:14,532 --> 00:01:19,204
"Mortality offers meaning to our lives
and morality helps navigate that meaning."

since it's my book.

Uh, yes, Professor May, you're probably
right about what you wrote. [chuckles]

Honestly, our biggest problem is
that we need more architects and actors.

60
00:02:52,338 --> 00:02:56,509
Well, sorry, but these younger demon
actors have no dedication to their craft.

61
00:02:56,593 --> 00:02:58,761
They think they can just start acting.

62
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:01,973
They have to learn
that acting is reacting.

63
00:03:02,056 --> 00:03:04,559
And reacting is pre-acting.

64
00:03:04,642 --> 00:03:07,979

[Eleanor chuckles]

174
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:54,265
[electronic dance music playing]

175
00:07:54,348 --> 00:07:55,433
[crowd cheering]

176
00:08:30,259 --> 00:08:32,011
[crowd applauding and cheering]

177
00:08:32,094 --> 00:08:33,930
What? Yes!

178
00:08:39,435 --> 00:08:41,479
[sighs] That was special.

179
00:08:41,562 --> 00:08:43,648
I'll never forget this night...

180
00:08:44,232 --> 00:08:47,151
until I walk through the door
and dissolve into the universe.

181
00:08:47,235 --> 00:08:48,486
Can I ask you something, buddy?

182
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:52,406
How did you... know?

183
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:56,911
Look, it wasn't like I heard a bell ring
or anything.

184
00:08:56,994 --> 00:09:01,123
I just suddenly had this calm feeling,

185
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:07,129
like the air inside my lungs was the
same as the air outside my body.

186
00:09:07,713 --> 00:09:08,798
It was peaceful.

187
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:13,261
You know the feeling when you think
a jalapeño popper is gonna be too hot,

188
00:09:13,344 --> 00:09:17,014
but you bite into it anyway
and it's actually the perfect temperature?

189
00:09:17,098 --> 00:09:20,768
Believe it or not, I do know that feeling.
That feeling rules.

190
00:09:20,851 --> 00:09:21,894
There you go.

191
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:23,396
Uh...

192
00:09:23,896 --> 00:09:25,606
Can I get your advice on something?

193
00:09:26,983 --> 00:09:29,360
I'm scared Janet's gonna forget me.

194
00:09:29,443 --> 00:09:32,905
Her falling in love with someone else,
I'm fine with that.

195
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:37,118
If Jason Momoa
or if Lara Croft, Tomb Raider gets in,

196
00:09:37,201 --> 00:09:39,620
and Janet's like, "That's what's up!"

197
00:09:39,704 --> 00:09:40,663
Totally cool.

198
00:09:40,746 --> 00:09:43,833
But her forgetting me would be sad.

199
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:45,751
So, I made her this.

200
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:49,005
What do you guys think?

201
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:50,590
It's lovely.

202
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:56,429
But she's not gonna forget you, man.
I mean, she literally can't.

203
00:09:56,512 --> 00:09:58,055
She remembers everything
that ever happened.

204
00:09:58,848 --> 00:10:03,394
Even if she could forget someone,
I don't think she's gonna forget you.

205
00:10:05,021 --> 00:10:06,063
Thanks.

206
00:10:06,147 --> 00:10:08,733
When I had Jason,
I was 18 years old.

207
00:10:08,816 --> 00:10:12,528
In many ways, Jason raised me
just as much as I raised him.

208
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:15,948
So, thanks for being a great dad, son!

209
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:17,366
-I love you, Dad!
-[crowd cheering]

210
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:20,202
Jason is the realest dude ever.

211
00:10:20,828 --> 00:10:23,914
I mean, none of us are real anymore.

212
00:10:23,998 --> 00:10:26,459
We're all just Caspers the Ghosts
and whatnot.

213
00:10:26,542 --> 00:10:29,003
Which is funny, because me and Jason
ain't even white.

214
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:30,921
Why are all ghosts white?

215
00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:34,300
Oh, dip, are ghosts racist?

216
00:10:34,383 --> 00:10:37,261
What I'm trying to say is,
"I love you, dawg.

217
00:10:38,095 --> 00:10:38,929
You're my hero.

218
00:10:39,972 --> 00:10:40,848
You're my best friend.

219
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:43,225
And you're my Gardner Minshew."

220
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:44,143
-[crowd cheering]

221
00:11:04,872 --> 00:11:07,291
[bird chirping]

222
00:11:16,842 --> 00:11:19,136
You can sit on that bench
as long as you want.

223
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,430
Whenever you're ready,
you just walk through.

224
00:11:27,853 --> 00:11:28,771
I love you, Janet.

225
00:11:29,397 --> 00:11:30,731
I love you, too, Jason.

226
00:11:32,608 --> 00:11:35,403
I hope you have a nice rest of eternity.

227
00:11:35,486 --> 00:11:36,487
Mmm.

228
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:37,613
I made you something.

229
00:11:40,074 --> 00:11:41,659
Oh, dip, I lost it.

230
00:11:41,742 --> 00:11:43,702
-It's okay.
-No, it's not.

231
00:11:43,786 --> 00:11:45,955
I made you this cool thing
so you'll remember me

232
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:47,498
even when you're married to Aquaman.

233
00:11:48,082 --> 00:11:50,876
And I lost it somewhere in this forest.

234
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:53,546
-Some magical squirrel probably ate it.
-Jason, it's okay.

235
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:56,006
I'm never gonna forget you.

236
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:59,051
In fact, to me,
you won't even really be gone.

237
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:02,263
I don't experience time
the same way you do.

238
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:06,016
I kind of live all times at once.

239
00:12:07,476 --> 00:12:08,644
I know what you mean.

240
00:12:09,186 --> 00:12:12,982
Once, I smoked salvia and saw the past
and the future at the same time.

241
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:13,941
Hmm.

242
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:16,694
Then I tried to brush my teeth
with my cat.

243
00:12:17,945 --> 00:12:23,075
To me, remembering moments with you
is the same as living in them.

244
00:12:24,869 --> 00:12:28,747
Could you just remember the happy times
and forget the bad stuff?

245
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:31,375
There was no bad stuff.

246
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:34,044
It was all good.

247
00:12:59,778 --> 00:13:00,613
Oh.

248
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:03,324
These spindles are gorgeous.

249
00:13:03,407 --> 00:13:07,119
And there's almost a feeling
of musculature to this transition.

250
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:10,915
The oak just sort of told me the shape
before I even got to the spokeshave.

251
00:13:10,998 --> 00:13:12,666
This under-bevel is a great trick.

252
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:16,086
It really makes it feel lighter,
while leaving you plenty of beef to carve.

253
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:18,672
It's really just a modified Danish line.

254
00:13:18,756 --> 00:13:20,007
Still, you made it your own.

255
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:22,301
This is as good a chair as I've seen.

256
00:13:22,384 --> 00:13:23,969
I have nothing left to teach you.

257
00:13:24,053 --> 00:13:25,346
Ah! Hurrah! [chuckles]

258
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:27,348
Thank you.

259
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:31,143
-Janet.
-Hi, there.

260
00:13:31,227 --> 00:13:32,520
Call up the list, please.

261
00:13:33,103 --> 00:13:34,813
Congratulations.

262
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:37,399
Actually, I just finished
repaving my driveway yesterday.

263
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:39,026
So, cross that one off, too.

264
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:41,779
Before you start your next project,

265
00:13:41,862 --> 00:13:44,949
you should know, that thing that you asked
me to tell you when it happened?

266
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:46,575
It happened.

267
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:53,165
I mean, they've gone through the system
so they'll be a little different, right?

268
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:54,833
One would hope. [exclaims]

269
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:56,919
I've never had lunch with Mum and Dad.

270
00:13:57,002 --> 00:13:59,338
I've only stood
silently behind their chairs

271
00:13:59,421 --> 00:14:01,549
while they ate lobster tail
with Oscar de la Renta.

272
00:14:02,132 --> 00:14:03,050
I'm right here.

273
00:14:03,842 --> 00:14:04,969
We will get through this together.

274
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:07,972
Here we go. [clears throat]

275
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:14,186
-Mother, Father, welcome to--
-My darlings!

276
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:15,604
My darlings.

277
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:17,690
My little girls!

278
00:14:17,773 --> 00:14:20,693
We love you both so much!

279
00:14:20,776 --> 00:14:22,736
[Manisha] So very much!

280
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:25,322
We have a million things
to talk to you about.

281
00:14:25,406 --> 00:14:28,033
But first, we are sorry.

282
00:14:28,117 --> 00:14:31,245
We'll just be endlessly sorry,
forever and ever.

283
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:37,418
-Holy crap.
-I know, right?

284
00:14:39,253 --> 00:14:40,087
[cheering]

285
00:14:42,298 --> 00:14:43,173
[indistinct chatter]

286
00:14:55,811 --> 00:14:56,937
[Tahani] Ugh!

287
00:14:57,021 --> 00:15:00,608
For the one millionth time
they've sent us teddy bears and flowers.

288
00:15:00,691 --> 00:15:03,694
You think they'd understand we can get
these things ourselves if we want.

289
00:15:03,777 --> 00:15:04,612
[exclaims]

290
00:15:05,487 --> 00:15:08,365
-Ah, that's lovely.
-Thanks.

291
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:11,243
You know, I never thought
I would say this,

292
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:12,828
but I'm getting a little bored

293
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:15,331
of Mom and Dad telling us
how much they love us.

294
00:15:15,414 --> 00:15:16,248
[chuckles]

295
00:15:16,832 --> 00:15:17,791
Yes.

296
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:20,920
Isn't that something?

297
00:15:25,382 --> 00:15:28,761
Well, this may not come as a surprise
to any of you, but...

298
00:15:30,638 --> 00:15:31,764
I'm ready to go.

299
00:15:31,847 --> 00:15:34,141
Oh, nuts. I knew it.

300
00:15:34,224 --> 00:15:36,060
-You finished everything on your list?
-[Tahani] I did.

301
00:15:36,727 --> 00:15:40,105
I learned how to install a bathtub,
fly a helicopter, defuse a bomb,

302
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:42,650
deliver the perfect backhand slice.

303
00:15:42,733 --> 00:15:46,445
My last goal was to spend
one meaningful day with my parents,

304
00:15:46,528 --> 00:15:48,656
and now I've spent thousands of them.

305
00:15:49,406 --> 00:15:50,574
I feel complete.

306
00:15:50,658 --> 00:15:52,785
Would you like me
to prepare a farewell party for you?

307
00:15:52,868 --> 00:15:55,037
No need. I've done it myself.

308
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,081
I've cooked all the food,
mixed all the drinks,

309
00:15:57,164 --> 00:15:59,875
made all the furniture,
repainted all the walls,

310
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:01,418
and trained all the animals.

311
00:16:01,502 --> 00:16:02,461
Champagne?

312
00:16:02,544 --> 00:16:03,545
Uh, sure.

313
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:04,755
Thank you, panda.

314
00:16:04,838 --> 00:16:07,299
Also, I've already said goodbye
to everyone else in my life.

315
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:08,968
My sister, my parents...

316
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:11,512
Bey and Jay, who took it very hard.

317
00:16:12,471 --> 00:16:14,848
Tonight, it's just us.

318
00:16:14,932 --> 00:16:16,141
[classical music playing]

319
00:16:23,107 --> 00:16:27,861
I hate to tell you this,
but your risotto was a little sticky.

320
00:16:27,945 --> 00:16:30,364
-Was it?
-No, damn it, it was amazing.

321
00:16:30,447 --> 00:16:34,618
Just trying to figure out a way to get you
to hang around for a few more Bearimys.

322
00:16:35,202 --> 00:16:36,704
[sighs] Can I tell you something?

323
00:16:37,788 --> 00:16:38,998
You're my role model.

324
00:16:39,707 --> 00:16:40,833
[scoffs] Come on.

325
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:41,917
I'm serious.

326
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:46,505
Babe, you were already
the most impressive person I ever met,

327
00:16:46,588 --> 00:16:48,549
and now you can do literally everything.

328
00:16:48,632 --> 00:16:51,885
If that's true,
it's because you inspired me.

329
00:16:51,969 --> 00:16:54,888
I admire you so very much.

330
00:16:54,972 --> 00:16:58,934
Your strength, your toughness,
your self-esteem, not to mention...

331
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:01,603
you have a rockin' bod.

332
00:17:02,479 --> 00:17:03,814
Did you just turn the tables on me?

333
00:17:05,774 --> 00:17:07,443
I got nothin' left to teach you.

334
00:17:08,444 --> 00:17:10,112
-Janet.
-Hi, there.

335
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:12,072
One more goal to add to the list, please.

336
00:17:12,823 --> 00:17:14,074
Now, cross it off.

337
00:17:15,659 --> 00:17:16,493
[Eleanor chuckles]

338
00:17:17,911 --> 00:17:20,164
I know we already said goodbye.
I'm not even here.

339
00:17:20,247 --> 00:17:21,373
I just had to see you one last time

340
00:17:21,457 --> 00:17:23,500
because I hooked up
with Alexander the Great.

341
00:17:23,584 --> 00:17:25,919
-[Tahani] Oh.
-And it was more like Alexander the Fine.

342
00:17:26,003 --> 00:17:26,837
-[both chuckle]
-Okay.

343
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,630
Anyway, I love you, I love you,
goodbye forever.

344
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:29,631
-Bye, love!
-[John] Bye.

345
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:30,632
[chuckles]

346
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:32,968
I admire your breadth of knowledge.

347
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:35,345
I can only do one thing, be an architect.

348
00:17:35,429 --> 00:17:39,683
I've spent the last 500 Bearimys
trying to learn how to play the guitar.

349
00:17:39,767 --> 00:17:42,478
And I just mastered "Hey There Delilah."

350
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:44,730
Don't sell yourself short, Michael.

351
00:17:44,813 --> 00:17:48,275
I dare say you're the greatest architect
in existence.

352
00:17:48,358 --> 00:17:52,112
-And I should know--
-Frank Gehry is my godfather.

353
00:17:52,196 --> 00:17:53,030
[all chuckling]

354
00:17:53,113 --> 00:17:55,032
Fair enough. I deserved that.

355
00:17:55,115 --> 00:17:58,494
[Eleanor laughs] Oh, Tahani,
I'm gonna miss you, babe.

356
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:00,954
[Tahani] Wait.

357
00:18:01,997 --> 00:18:02,831
I don't want to leave.

358
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:05,584
Great. Then, stay.

359
00:18:05,667 --> 00:18:08,378
New party, everyone. A staying party.

360
00:18:08,462 --> 00:18:10,506
No, I also don't want to stay.

361
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:13,092
I'm done here,
but I don't want to go there.

362
00:18:13,967 --> 00:18:15,552
It's kind of your only options.

363
00:18:15,636 --> 00:18:17,221
No, they aren't.

364
00:18:17,971 --> 00:18:20,891
I want to learn to do
what you do, Michael.

365
00:18:20,974 --> 00:18:23,060
I want to be an architect,
design afterlives.

366
00:18:23,143 --> 00:18:27,481
[laughs] Tahani, you're a wonderful person
but you're a person.

367
00:18:27,564 --> 00:18:29,358
-It's impossible.
-Nonsense.

368
00:18:29,441 --> 00:18:32,152
I can learn,
just like I learned all this other stuff.

369
00:18:32,236 --> 00:18:35,405
I've spent most of my life
pretending to help people.

370
00:18:35,489 --> 00:18:37,658
If I were an architect,
I could do it for real.

371
00:18:37,741 --> 00:18:39,326
Let me at least try.

372
00:18:40,869 --> 00:18:43,205
Don't make me talk to your manager.

373
00:18:43,705 --> 00:18:44,665
[all] Oh!

374
00:18:45,749 --> 00:18:47,251
-[Eleanor] That's my girl!
-[Chidi] Oh!

375
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:48,836
Hey, Jeff.

376
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:51,880
Boy, kind of getting away
from you here, huh?

377
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:56,677
Yeah. I love frogs though,
so it's awesome.

378
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:58,929
I did bring you one.

379
00:18:59,012 --> 00:19:01,223
Thanks, Tahani. Just toss it on the pile.

380
00:19:01,765 --> 00:19:05,519
<i>Wait, hang on, hang on.</i>
<i>So you can never tell a woman to smile?</i>

381
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:08,981
<i>What if she'd legitimately be prettier</i>
<i>if she smiled?</i>

382
00:19:09,064 --> 00:19:10,190
<i>Aren't I helping her?</i>

383
00:19:10,858 --> 00:19:15,195
Glenn, Beadie,
this is your new intern, Tahani.

384
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:17,281
Tahani! This is so neat.

385
00:19:17,364 --> 00:19:20,450
I haven't seen you
since I was exploded into goo.

386
00:19:20,534 --> 00:19:22,369
I didn't get any me on you, did I?

387
00:19:22,452 --> 00:19:25,664
You did, but it's all
goo under the bridge.

388
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:28,792
Anyway, I want to learn everything.

389
00:19:28,876 --> 00:19:31,879
I shall start at the bottom
and earn my way up.

390
00:19:31,962 --> 00:19:34,673
To wit,
would anyone like a cup of antimatter?

391
00:19:34,756 --> 00:19:36,884
Sure,
I take mine with non-dairy neutrinos.

392
00:19:36,967 --> 00:19:37,885
Coming right up.

393
00:19:41,263 --> 00:19:45,601
Thank you, Michael, for everything.

394
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:46,602
You're welcome.

395
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:50,898
I brought you a little
"first day on the job" present.

396
00:19:51,607 --> 00:19:52,941
[chuckles]

397
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:54,735
Once you're a big deal around here,

398
00:19:54,818 --> 00:19:57,654
I hope you don't mind
if I brag about knowing you.

399
00:19:58,614 --> 00:20:02,367
Name dropping is a little gauche, Michael,
but do as you must.

400
00:20:03,577 --> 00:20:04,411
[Michael chuckles]

401
00:20:12,961 --> 00:20:17,382
"Working out the terms of
moral justification is an unending task."

402
00:20:17,466 --> 00:20:18,717
Boom!

403
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,010
I did it.

404
00:20:20,093 --> 00:20:23,639
It only took me 2,000 Bearimys,
but I finally finished that book.

405
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:28,518
[laughs] Sucker! Reading you was
an unending task, but I freaking did it!

406
00:20:28,602 --> 00:20:31,230
-Congrats, babe.
-Thanks. What are you reading?

407
00:20:31,772 --> 00:20:32,606
{\an8}<i>The Da Vinci Code.</i>

408
00:20:32,689 --> 00:20:35,067
-Really?
-After a thousand lifetimes

409
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:38,278
of reading the most difficult writings
in the world, I've acquired a new passion:

410
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:40,322
garbage books!

411
00:20:40,405 --> 00:20:43,200
Do you think I would have been
a good symbologist...

412
00:20:43,825 --> 00:20:45,786
-if that were a real job?
-Yes, I do.

413
00:20:45,869 --> 00:20:48,288
You're very cute.
Come on, we gotta go to dinner.

414
00:20:49,373 --> 00:20:51,959
[Simone] I can't believe
she learned to cook this well.

415
00:20:52,042 --> 00:20:53,460
When I first met Tahani on Earth,

416
00:20:53,543 --> 00:20:55,671
she was trying to shove jewelry
into a vending machine.

417
00:20:55,754 --> 00:20:56,755
[all laughing]

418
00:20:56,838 --> 00:21:00,550
Okay, well, if she is an architect,
then she should design my idea.

419
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:03,804
A karaoke room that's also a tanning bed.

420
00:21:03,887 --> 00:21:04,888
Ooh, yes.

421
00:21:04,972 --> 00:21:07,975
And the harder you commit to the song,
the tanner you get.

422
00:21:08,058 --> 00:21:12,896
I am so glad that going through the system
did not totally change you two dingdongs.

423
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:13,855
[giggling]

424
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:16,316
For dessert, we have to get the tiramisu.

425
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:20,445
Man, Chidi Anagonye,
just casually making choices.

426
00:21:20,529 --> 00:21:23,907
I never thought I'd live to see it.
I mean, I guess I didn't.

427
00:21:23,991 --> 00:21:26,827
-[all laughing]
-That's right, 'cause we're all dead!

428
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:28,287
[all laughing and cheering]

429
00:21:31,748 --> 00:21:32,874
That was so fun.

430
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:36,044
Yeah. Yeah, it's always fun to see them.

431
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:38,171
Every time we do it, it's fun.

432
00:21:38,255 --> 00:21:41,091
I had coffee with my mom the other day,
and she says hi.

433
00:21:41,174 --> 00:21:44,886
But she also finally learned
how to pronounce your mom's name,

434
00:21:45,595 --> 00:21:47,180
-which is good.
-[both chuckle]

435
00:21:47,264 --> 00:21:50,350
Yeah. They were joking about that
last time we saw them.

436
00:21:50,434 --> 00:21:51,393
-Mmm.
-Remember?

437
00:21:51,476 --> 00:21:53,103
-Oh, right. Yeah.

438
00:21:55,814 --> 00:21:56,732
Shakespeare went through the door.

439
00:21:56,815 --> 00:21:57,941
-Really?
-Yeah.

440
00:21:58,608 --> 00:22:00,986
-Everyone's talking about it.
-It's probably for the best.

441
00:22:01,069 --> 00:22:04,656
His last 4,000 plays were not nearly
as good as the ones he wrote on Earth.

442
00:22:05,198 --> 00:22:08,410
I mean, did you see
<i>The Tempest Two: Here We Blow Again?</i>

443
00:22:08,493 --> 00:22:09,786
-Mmm.
-Woof!

444
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:10,954
[both laughing]

445
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,168
Do you mind if we go home?

446
00:22:16,835 --> 00:22:17,669
I'm tired.

447
00:22:17,753 --> 00:22:20,255
Sure. Okay.

448
00:22:25,844 --> 00:22:27,345
[Chidi exhales sharply] Uh...

449
00:22:29,014 --> 00:22:30,307
I'm gonna get ready for bed.

450
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:33,310
Cool, I'm gonna take a little stroll.
I'll see you in a bit.

451
00:22:33,393 --> 00:22:34,269
Okay.

452
00:22:40,942 --> 00:22:43,070
-[Eleanor] Dude!
-Hey. Perfect.

453
00:22:43,153 --> 00:22:44,446
Are these good lyrics?

454
00:22:45,322 --> 00:22:47,240
[singing] <i>♪ The psychedelic stardust ♪</i>

455
00:22:47,324 --> 00:22:49,326
<i>♪ And moonbeam banana-- ♪</i>

456
00:22:49,409 --> 00:22:50,786
No, stop. That's terrible.

457
00:22:50,869 --> 00:22:53,830
And we got a problem.
I think Chidi's gonna leave.

458
00:22:53,914 --> 00:22:54,748
Really?

459
00:22:56,083 --> 00:22:57,667
Did he say he was ready?

460
00:22:57,751 --> 00:23:01,546
He didn't say exactly that,
but he's getting close. I can tell.

461
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:05,175
I need to do something to shake things up,
light a spark.

462
00:23:05,258 --> 00:23:07,886
-Oh. Janet?
-Hi, there.

463
00:23:07,969 --> 00:23:11,014
Hi. I think Chidi's almost ready
to walk through the door,

464
00:23:11,098 --> 00:23:12,099
and I need to keep him here,

465
00:23:12,182 --> 00:23:16,103
so, um, can you make me a bed
shaped like a giant highlighter,

466
00:23:16,186 --> 00:23:19,356
and a sexy, edible valedictorian robe?

467
00:23:19,439 --> 00:23:21,858
No, I think this calls
for something spiritual.

468
00:23:21,942 --> 00:23:24,361
Ah, okay, but if I do this right,
my man's gonna be talking to God,

469
00:23:24,444 --> 00:23:26,154
you know what I mean?
Wait, what do you mean?

470
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:29,157
Forgive me, Eleanor,
but if Chidi's ready to go...

471
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:30,367
it's time for him to go.

472
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:32,702
Uh, he didn't say that yet, though.

473
00:23:32,786 --> 00:23:34,621
We're in classic Chidi gray area.

474
00:23:34,704 --> 00:23:37,791
You need to remind him
of what's great about this place.

475
00:23:38,166 --> 00:23:41,878
Oh, oh, remember where he took us
the first month we were all together?

476
00:23:41,962 --> 00:23:44,840
Oh, great idea. Yes! Janet, set the scene.

477
00:23:44,923 --> 00:23:48,385
Okay. Would you like it restored
to its original glory?

478
00:23:48,468 --> 00:23:50,929
No. First time he went, he was in college.

479
00:23:51,012 --> 00:23:54,975
Have it look and feel exactly like it was
that day when he fell in love with it.

480
00:23:55,684 --> 00:23:58,395
Also, pack me the edible robe.
That might seal the deal.

481
00:23:59,312 --> 00:24:00,730
Okay, you're all set.

482
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,986
Hey, guess what? Surprise trip, come on.

483
00:24:06,069 --> 00:24:08,655
-Surprise trip? Now?
-Yeah.

484
00:24:08,738 --> 00:24:11,241
Special fun trip, just us two. Let's go.

485
00:24:11,324 --> 00:24:13,201
Can I change out of my pajamas first?

486
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:15,036
Let the door do it. Come on!

487
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,663
-Come on, come on, come on!
-Okay.

488
00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:27,883
Oh... Oh, man, Eleanor.

489
00:24:27,966 --> 00:24:30,427
Right? We haven't been here in so long.

490
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:34,723
[Chidi] Athens. Man, this city,
it takes my breath away every time.

491
00:24:35,348 --> 00:24:38,351
Talk it out, bud. Tell me everything
you know about this place.

492
00:24:38,435 --> 00:24:39,686
Because, full disclosure,

493
00:24:39,769 --> 00:24:41,396
I didn't really listen
the first time you told me.

494
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:43,857
[chuckles] Well, I mean...

495
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:45,108
That's the Acropolis.

496
00:24:45,192 --> 00:24:47,736
Oh, and this is the Pnyx.

497
00:24:47,819 --> 00:24:50,447
Thousands of Athenians would gather here

498
00:24:50,530 --> 00:24:53,825
and listen to people discuss their city
and its laws

499
00:24:53,909 --> 00:24:56,036
from that stage right there.

500
00:24:56,119 --> 00:24:58,205
This is literally where democracy started.

501
00:24:58,288 --> 00:24:59,581
Well, that's fine and dandy,

502
00:24:59,664 --> 00:25:02,751
but as you might know,
I'm kind of a philosophy gal.

503
00:25:03,835 --> 00:25:05,754
Where were the big brains hanging out?

504
00:25:06,838 --> 00:25:10,217
Socrates, Aristotle, Plato, Diogenes...

505
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:13,720
they all gathered right here
in the Agora.

506
00:25:13,803 --> 00:25:16,640
It was like the Avengers,
but for super thinkers.

507
00:25:16,723 --> 00:25:17,557
[Eleanor chuckles]

508
00:25:17,641 --> 00:25:20,518
Come on, you brought me here.
You knew what was gonna happen.

509
00:25:20,602 --> 00:25:22,729
No, I love that you're so happy.

510
00:25:22,812 --> 00:25:24,231
Hey, let me ask you something.

511
00:25:24,314 --> 00:25:28,360
Is it weird that when I picture
Ancient Greeks I make them really hot?

512
00:25:28,443 --> 00:25:31,863
To me, Aristotle is basically
John Stamos with a beard.

513
00:25:31,947 --> 00:25:34,866
-Honestly, that's how I picture him, too.
-Good, same page.

514
00:25:54,010 --> 00:25:56,346
What's this called again? "Kouluvri"?

515
00:25:56,429 --> 00:25:59,766
Koulouri. Man, I lived on these
when I was here.

516
00:25:59,849 --> 00:26:02,686
I like to picture
a young Chidi Anagonye here,

517
00:26:02,769 --> 00:26:06,481
reading, nerding out,
treating himself to a koulouri

518
00:26:06,564 --> 00:26:09,985
if he had an astute insight
into Aristotelian virtue ethics.

519
00:26:10,068 --> 00:26:13,196
That... is accurate.

520
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:17,367
That is an accurate picture
of 20-year-old me.

521
00:26:19,452 --> 00:26:22,289
This was so special. Thank you.

522
00:26:22,956 --> 00:26:23,915
Should we head home?

523
00:26:25,083 --> 00:26:28,545
Nope, because we're not done yet.

524
00:26:28,628 --> 00:26:31,298
There's more special trip. Janet.

525
00:26:31,381 --> 00:26:33,591
Hi, there. You enjoying your trip, Chidi?

526
00:26:33,675 --> 00:26:36,219
Yes, we are, but it's not over yet.

527
00:26:36,803 --> 00:26:40,348
We are ready to head
to destination number two, remember?

528
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:42,183
Yes, of course.

529
00:26:42,267 --> 00:26:43,685
Head right this way.

530
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:51,359
[Chidi] Oh, man. Oh, wow.

531
00:26:52,277 --> 00:26:55,989
-Paris.
-Yes, Paris. Obviously. [chuckles]

532
00:26:56,698 --> 00:27:01,077
My favorite city. And you even picked
the ideal weather.

533
00:27:01,161 --> 00:27:05,290
Overcast and chilly.
Perfect for staying inside and reading.

534
00:27:05,373 --> 00:27:07,375
Is this what you were hinting to me?

535
00:27:07,459 --> 00:27:10,045
I was thinking Six Flags,
but this is way better.

536
00:27:11,796 --> 00:27:14,299
I used to come to this café every day
when I lived here.

537
00:27:14,382 --> 00:27:16,426
I tried to sit
in a different seat each time,

538
00:27:16,509 --> 00:27:19,846
so I could eventually say
that I definitely sat

539
00:27:19,929 --> 00:27:22,849
in the exact same place
as Jean-Paul Sartre,

540
00:27:22,932 --> 00:27:28,063
Simone de Beauvoir, and Richard Wright,
Brecht, James Baldwin...

541
00:27:28,146 --> 00:27:31,524
Well, we got all the time
in the world now, baby.

542
00:27:32,025 --> 00:27:34,319
Put that booty
in a seat warmed by history.

543
00:27:37,238 --> 00:27:38,948
Eleanor, I know what you're doing.

544
00:27:40,075 --> 00:27:43,203
Being the best eternal girlfriend ever?
Guilty.

545
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:45,413
Let's take a walk.

546
00:27:47,665 --> 00:27:51,753
So, Eleanor, here it is.

547
00:27:51,836 --> 00:27:54,005
I love you...

548
00:27:54,089 --> 00:27:57,008
-completely and utterly--
-Oh, crap.

549
00:27:57,092 --> 00:27:58,051
[voice breaking] But I have to go.

550
00:27:58,718 --> 00:28:00,303
But you don't, though.

551
00:28:00,387 --> 00:28:03,306
You don't have to go.
You don't have to leave me.

552
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:08,269
I don't want to leave you.
I'm just... ready to leave.

553
00:28:08,353 --> 00:28:10,980
I have the same feeling
that the others described,

554
00:28:11,064 --> 00:28:13,191
a kind of quietude in my soul.

555
00:28:13,274 --> 00:28:15,360
But... you just had it.

556
00:28:15,443 --> 00:28:17,612
What if those other dummies
didn't wait long enough

557
00:28:17,695 --> 00:28:19,155
and the feeling fades,

558
00:28:19,239 --> 00:28:21,908
and you get to spend
another billion Bearimys

559
00:28:21,991 --> 00:28:25,120
in fake afterlife Europe
with your kickass girlfriend?

560
00:28:25,203 --> 00:28:26,329
I didn't just have it.

561
00:28:27,163 --> 00:28:28,706
I've had it a long time.

562
00:28:29,958 --> 00:28:32,335
Remember that day
we were with our parents?

563
00:28:33,128 --> 00:28:34,963
My mom kissed you goodbye...

564
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:39,843
and got lipstick on your cheek,
and your mom rubbed it off.

565
00:28:41,052 --> 00:28:43,805
I don't know why that was it, but...

566
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:46,307
that was it.

567
00:28:46,808 --> 00:28:49,769
-[sighs]
-And I didn't want to tell you, because...

568
00:28:51,187 --> 00:28:54,190
-Because...
-No, man, this can't... be.

569
00:28:54,899 --> 00:28:56,860
Because Jason's gone,

570
00:28:56,943 --> 00:29:00,447
Tahani's off doing her thing
and I'm not ready to go.

571
00:29:00,530 --> 00:29:03,450
So if you leave, then I'm alone here.

572
00:29:03,533 --> 00:29:05,118
[voice breaking] I was alone
my whole life...

573
00:29:06,369 --> 00:29:08,872
and I told myself I like it that way,
but I don't.

574
00:29:10,415 --> 00:29:13,251
I like being with you. [sniffs]

575
00:29:16,045 --> 00:29:17,255
Okay. I won't go.

576
00:29:18,381 --> 00:29:20,383
-Really?
-Yeah, I won't go. There's...

577
00:29:21,676 --> 00:29:23,887
There is still plenty to do.

578
00:29:24,888 --> 00:29:25,805
I'll stay.

579
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:28,433
[chuckles]

580
00:29:28,516 --> 00:29:30,393
Who's ready for Six Flags?

581
00:29:30,477 --> 00:29:33,563
Oh, we're good. We got it.
He's gonna stay.

582
00:29:38,276 --> 00:29:42,489
So, what do you wanna do?
Turn into birds and fly to Notre Dame?

583
00:29:43,031 --> 00:29:44,491
Stand on top of the Eiffel Tower

584
00:29:44,574 --> 00:29:47,202
and throw water balloons
onto imaginary tourists?

585
00:29:47,285 --> 00:29:48,620
[chuckles] Whatever you want to do.

586
00:29:49,245 --> 00:29:53,082
Okay, well, let's freshen up,
have dinner at some schmancy restaurant,

587
00:29:53,166 --> 00:29:54,709
order a million-dollar bottle of wine,

588
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:57,378
even though it tastes
exactly like cheap, stupid wine,

589
00:29:57,462 --> 00:29:59,422
sit in a room at the Georges Cinq

590
00:29:59,506 --> 00:30:02,675
and watch <i>Real Housewives of...</i>
whatever city they're doing that in now.

591
00:30:03,885 --> 00:30:04,844
Love it.

592
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:08,306
I'm gonna walk around my old neighborhood.
See where I used to live.

593
00:30:08,389 --> 00:30:10,850
-Meet you at the restaurant?
-Yeah.

594
00:30:10,934 --> 00:30:11,976
All right.

595
00:30:40,547 --> 00:30:42,924
Let's see what's on the menu.

596
00:30:44,384 --> 00:30:48,096
"Literally anything
you could possibly imagine." Hmm.

597
00:30:48,179 --> 00:30:49,347
What are you thinking?

598
00:30:50,348 --> 00:30:55,019
"Working out the terms of
moral justification is an unending task."

599
00:30:55,603 --> 00:30:58,189
That's what I was thinking about.
That sentence.

600
00:30:58,273 --> 00:30:59,732
You wanna eat that sentence for dinner?

601
00:30:59,816 --> 00:31:02,277
Can we eat words?
'Cause I asked Janet about this and--

602
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:06,239
No, no, it's the last line
of Scanlon's book, remember?

603
00:31:06,322 --> 00:31:07,156
Ah.

604
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:09,284
The whole book is about
how we should try to find rules

605
00:31:09,367 --> 00:31:13,121
other people can't reasonably reject,
and then he ends it by saying,

606
00:31:13,204 --> 00:31:17,876
the search for how to find those rules
will go on forever.

607
00:31:18,626 --> 00:31:22,380
I proposed a rule
that Chidis shouldn't be allowed to leave

608
00:31:23,256 --> 00:31:25,174
because it would make Eleanors sad.

609
00:31:25,842 --> 00:31:27,343
And I could do this forever.

610
00:31:27,844 --> 00:31:30,513
Zip you around the universe,
showing you cool stuff,

611
00:31:31,431 --> 00:31:36,728
and I'd still never find the justification
for getting you to stay...

612
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:41,024
because it's a selfish rule.

613
00:31:42,567 --> 00:31:46,446
I owe it to you to let you go.

614
00:31:53,453 --> 00:31:56,539
[imperceptible]

615
00:32:08,217 --> 00:32:10,595
I was never good at being sad,

616
00:32:10,678 --> 00:32:14,223
partly because
my mom straight up told me not to be.

617
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:17,936
But this is sad, man. [sighs]

618
00:32:19,437 --> 00:32:20,855
You got a John Locke quote

619
00:32:20,939 --> 00:32:24,233
or a piece of Kantian wisdom
you can throw at me?

620
00:32:24,317 --> 00:32:28,321
Those guys were more focused
on rules and regulations.

621
00:32:29,322 --> 00:32:33,618
For spiritual stuff,
you gotta turn to the East.

622
00:32:33,701 --> 00:32:35,870
I'll take anything you got. Hit me.

623
00:32:35,954 --> 00:32:36,788
[Chidi sighs]

624
00:32:39,207 --> 00:32:43,086
Picture a wave... in the ocean.

625
00:32:45,171 --> 00:32:47,131
You can see it, measure it, its height,

626
00:32:47,215 --> 00:32:53,554
the way the sunlight refracts
when it passes through and it's there,

627
00:32:53,638 --> 00:32:56,474
and you can see it,
and you know what it is, it's a wave.

628
00:32:57,642 --> 00:33:02,355
And then it crashes on the shore...
and it's gone.

629
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:08,361
But the water is still there.

630
00:33:10,571 --> 00:33:16,619
The wave was just a different way
for the water to be,

631
00:33:16,703 --> 00:33:18,162
for a little while.

632
00:33:21,082 --> 00:33:23,835
That's one conception of death,
for a Buddhist.

633
00:33:24,961 --> 00:33:28,381
The wave returns to the ocean...

634
00:33:31,592 --> 00:33:33,219
-[sighs]
-...where it came from,

635
00:33:34,929 --> 00:33:36,806
and where it's supposed to be.

636
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:41,269
-Not bad, Buddhists.
-Not bad.

637
00:33:44,439 --> 00:33:46,065
None of this is bad.

638
00:33:54,824 --> 00:33:57,368
-I need you to do me one last favor.
-Mmm-hmm?

639
00:33:58,995 --> 00:34:01,330
Say goodbye to me now.

640
00:34:01,414 --> 00:34:03,374
Then leave before I wake up.

641
00:34:41,037 --> 00:34:41,871
[sighs]

642
00:34:53,007 --> 00:34:55,885
You can sit on that bench
as long as you'd like

643
00:34:55,968 --> 00:34:59,764
and whenever you're ready,
you just walk through.

644
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:03,017
I'm ready.

645
00:35:22,036 --> 00:35:23,287
Oh, dip! You're back.

646
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:25,123
Jason?

647
00:35:25,206 --> 00:35:26,040
Yeah!

648
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:28,668
What... but how... why...

649
00:35:29,377 --> 00:35:31,045
Funny story.

650
00:35:31,129 --> 00:35:33,172
-Remember how I made you something...
-Uh-huh.

651
00:35:33,256 --> 00:35:35,174
...and I thought I lost it
because it wasn't in my pocket?

652
00:35:35,258 --> 00:35:37,426
-Uh-huh?
-Turns out, it was in my other pocket.

653
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:39,846
-[chuckles]
-By the time I found it, you were gone.

654
00:35:39,929 --> 00:35:41,973
I was just gonna leave it for you,
but I was worried

655
00:35:42,056 --> 00:35:46,978
it would get eaten by that magic squirrel,
so I decided to wait for you to come back.

656
00:35:47,061 --> 00:35:51,816
Every so often, a different Janet came,
but I knew it wasn't you.

657
00:35:51,899 --> 00:35:54,777
Jason, it's been, like, 1,000 Bearimys.

658
00:35:54,861 --> 00:35:57,363
I know. But I wanted to see you again.

659
00:35:58,447 --> 00:35:59,740
It was actually pretty easy to wait.

660
00:36:00,324 --> 00:36:04,620
<i>I sort of just sat quietly</i>
<i>and let my mind drift away...</i>

661
00:36:05,663 --> 00:36:09,750
<i>thought about you</i>
<i>and the infinity of the universe.</i>

662
00:36:10,334 --> 00:36:11,586
Kind of like a monk.

663
00:36:11,669 --> 00:36:13,045
What do you mean?

664
00:36:14,589 --> 00:36:15,423
Um...

665
00:36:21,304 --> 00:36:22,889
Looks good, not-a-girl.

666
00:36:27,602 --> 00:36:28,811
Chidi, wait up.

667
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:40,489
Hey-o! Time to go nuts,
because I brought doughnuts!

668
00:36:40,573 --> 00:36:41,449
Huh! No one's here?

669
00:36:41,532 --> 00:36:43,492
Shoot. That was gonna be a big laugh.

670
00:36:43,576 --> 00:36:46,120
Hey, sweetie. Did you not get the message?

671
00:36:46,204 --> 00:36:48,164
No. Why, was the meeting canceled?

672
00:36:48,247 --> 00:36:51,834
Uh, yeah, forever.
We dissolved the council.

673
00:36:51,918 --> 00:36:53,419
-What?
-We don't need it anymore.

674
00:36:53,502 --> 00:36:55,463
Your system's working perfectly.

675
00:36:55,546 --> 00:36:58,216
Millions of humans
passing their tests, you know.

676
00:36:58,299 --> 00:37:00,927
Oh, Vicky's really killing it
on the training. So, it's all good.

677
00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:03,054
Well, you... all right, well, hang on.

678
00:37:03,137 --> 00:37:06,807
Look, how are we even sure
that this is the right system?

679
00:37:06,891 --> 00:37:08,643
I mean, honestly, I think Shawn was right.

680
00:37:08,726 --> 00:37:10,978
This whole thing sucks,
and we should start from scratch.

681
00:37:11,062 --> 00:37:14,774
Relax, worrywart. Take a load off, huh?

682
00:37:14,857 --> 00:37:19,612
Enjoy yourself. You know what I just
discovered recently? Podcasts.

683
00:37:19,695 --> 00:37:23,366
There's, like, a billion of them
and they just keep coming.

684
00:37:23,449 --> 00:37:24,533
-Hmm.
-Now, scoot!

685
00:37:24,617 --> 00:37:27,995
I got a new <i>Radiolab</i> to listen to
about how clams learn.

686
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:30,665
-[chuckles] Hmm.
-Pretty excited.

687
00:37:43,344 --> 00:37:45,054
[Eleanor on recording] <i>I love you.</i>

688
00:37:45,137 --> 00:37:46,597
<i>And you don't need to respond</i>

689
00:37:46,681 --> 00:37:49,392
<i>'cause I know</i>
<i>you have trouble saying how you feel--</i>

690
00:37:49,475 --> 00:37:50,893
[Chidi on recording] <i>I love you, too.</i>

691
00:37:54,063 --> 00:37:55,523
Knock, knock, knock.

692
00:37:56,065 --> 00:37:57,775
Oh. Hey, what's up?

693
00:37:57,858 --> 00:37:58,859
Can I talk to you for a sec?

694
00:37:58,943 --> 00:38:02,571
[sighs] Yeah, sure, why not? Hey, Derek?

695
00:38:02,655 --> 00:38:05,449
Yes, Mindy? What can Derek do for you?

696
00:38:05,533 --> 00:38:09,287
Eleanor and I are gonna talk for a bit,
so go into your nethersphere.

697
00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:10,496
That's Derek?

698
00:38:10,579 --> 00:38:14,959
Mindy has rebooted Derek more than
151 million times.

699
00:38:15,042 --> 00:38:17,545
Derek is now both
a singular point in space,

700
00:38:17,628 --> 00:38:20,298
and yet Derek also contains space itself.

701
00:38:20,381 --> 00:38:23,134
The nexus of Derek is without dimension.

702
00:38:23,217 --> 00:38:25,094
The moment of Derek's creation

703
00:38:25,177 --> 00:38:27,430
and the eventual heat death
of the universe

704
00:38:27,513 --> 00:38:30,099
are now inexorably the same.

705
00:38:30,182 --> 00:38:32,476
Ugh, you are so annoying!

706
00:38:35,646 --> 00:38:36,647
Want a beer?

707
00:38:36,731 --> 00:38:39,066
So that's how you spend your days,

708
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:42,778
wandering around, searching for the thing
that makes you complete?

709
00:38:42,862 --> 00:38:43,779
Pretty much.

710
00:38:43,863 --> 00:38:46,866
I thought it was connected to my parents
or my friends.

711
00:38:46,949 --> 00:38:49,702
But now I think
it might be something else.

712
00:38:49,785 --> 00:38:50,995
I think it might be you.

713
00:38:51,579 --> 00:38:53,164
I think my final mission

714
00:38:53,247 --> 00:38:56,917
might be to convince you
to go through the system. Take the test.

715
00:38:58,419 --> 00:38:59,545
You know, when I first met you,

716
00:38:59,628 --> 00:39:03,924
I thought... [exhales heavily]
"Well, there's a chick I understand."

717
00:39:04,008 --> 00:39:07,553
Lone wolf, totally independent,
knows what she wants.

718
00:39:07,636 --> 00:39:09,430
[both] Cocaine and self-pleasure.

719
00:39:09,513 --> 00:39:13,476
Right. But I actually think
you're a version of me

720
00:39:13,559 --> 00:39:15,311
if I'd never met my friends.

721
00:39:15,394 --> 00:39:19,940
You're the worst-case scenario
of what I could've become. No offense.

722
00:39:20,024 --> 00:39:24,320
None taken. Look, the thing is, Eleanor,
I am fine with where I am.

723
00:39:24,403 --> 00:39:26,739
See, I don't think you are.

724
00:39:26,822 --> 00:39:29,116
Or at least, you could be better.

725
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:32,411
If we're cut from the same cloth,
then trust me,

726
00:39:32,495 --> 00:39:34,789
there's a greater happiness
waiting for you

727
00:39:34,872 --> 00:39:36,957
if you form bonds with other people.

728
00:39:37,041 --> 00:39:39,043
And I think you know that.

729
00:39:39,126 --> 00:39:40,920
You told me about me and Chidi that time.

730
00:39:41,003 --> 00:39:43,839
You showed me the tape.
You said you were rooting for us.

731
00:39:43,923 --> 00:39:45,883
I think you have the ability to care.

732
00:39:48,052 --> 00:39:51,555
I don't know.
Caring just seems like a lot of work.

733
00:39:51,639 --> 00:39:54,558
-Mmm.
-And I have been on my own for so long.

734
00:39:54,642 --> 00:39:58,104
I can't imagine putting my fate
in the hands of some stranger.

735
00:39:58,187 --> 00:40:00,231
I thought you might say that.

736
00:40:01,649 --> 00:40:03,609
[Eleanor] Hello, gorgeous.

737
00:40:03,692 --> 00:40:05,569
Eleanor! [gasps]

738
00:40:06,153 --> 00:40:10,157
And Mindy St. Claire!
As I neither live nor breathe.

739
00:40:10,241 --> 00:40:11,659
What brings you ladies here?

740
00:40:11,742 --> 00:40:15,579
I'm trying to convince Mindy
to enter the system after all this time.

741
00:40:15,663 --> 00:40:19,375
She's a little worried
about who might end up designing her test.

742
00:40:19,458 --> 00:40:20,960
Say no more. I'm on the case.

743
00:40:21,043 --> 00:40:23,754
Really? Are you certified or whatever?

744
00:40:23,838 --> 00:40:26,590
Well, not yet,
but it won't be long, right, Shawn?

745
00:40:26,674 --> 00:40:31,470
I think you'll find that Tahani
will be certified very soon.

746
00:40:32,346 --> 00:40:36,308
Did that sound evil?
I didn't mean it to. I was sincere.

747
00:40:36,392 --> 00:40:37,518
Force of habit.

748
00:40:37,601 --> 00:40:40,771
I do think you'll find
that Tahani will be certified very...

749
00:40:40,855 --> 00:40:41,689
Shut up, Glenn!

750
00:40:41,772 --> 00:40:45,734
Great. So, you go back to your old life,
chill with your floating Derek head.

751
00:40:45,818 --> 00:40:48,237
When Tahani gets certified,
you enter the system,

752
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:49,905
Tahani designs your test. Deal?

753
00:40:51,365 --> 00:40:53,200
Why not? Something new.

754
00:40:53,284 --> 00:40:54,285
[Tahani chuckles]

755
00:40:54,368 --> 00:40:57,663
Thanks for giving a crap about me.

756
00:40:57,746 --> 00:41:02,626
I don't really give a crap about myself,
so it's nice that someone does.

757
00:41:03,878 --> 00:41:06,338
I'm really glad I filmed you having sex.

758
00:41:07,089 --> 00:41:08,090
Me, too.

759
00:41:13,554 --> 00:41:15,973
You can sit on that bench
as long as you want.

760
00:41:16,056 --> 00:41:18,309
Whenever you're ready,
you just walk through.

761
00:41:19,226 --> 00:41:21,562
Well, good, because I'm definitely ready.

762
00:41:23,189 --> 00:41:24,440
I'm ready.

763
00:41:26,817 --> 00:41:28,235
I'm not ready. [chuckles nervously]

764
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:30,029
Damn it, Janet. What the fork?

765
00:41:30,112 --> 00:41:32,615
I should be ready and I'm not.

766
00:41:32,698 --> 00:41:33,699
[Michael] But I am.

767
00:41:35,701 --> 00:41:38,746
-Michael, what are you doing?
-I'm going through the door.

768
00:41:38,829 --> 00:41:43,834
There's nothing left for me to do.
I feel sated and complete.

769
00:41:43,918 --> 00:41:46,003
I'm not sure
you're thinking this through, dude.

770
00:41:46,086 --> 00:41:46,921
Yes, I am.

771
00:41:47,004 --> 00:41:48,672
A calm has washed over me...

772
00:41:49,423 --> 00:41:50,299
Blah, blah, blah.

773
00:41:50,382 --> 00:41:51,217
Goodbye.

774
00:41:52,593 --> 00:41:53,802
[sighs]

775
00:41:58,516 --> 00:42:00,267
Did I go through the wrong way?

776
00:42:00,351 --> 00:42:02,061
Wait, wait, just one...

777
00:42:02,144 --> 00:42:03,979
This is gonna look silly,
but it probably will work...

778
00:42:04,063 --> 00:42:05,272
[grunting]

779
00:42:05,356 --> 00:42:06,524
Michael, what are you doing?

780
00:42:06,607 --> 00:42:11,111
I am returning my damn essence
to the damn fabric of the damn universe.

781
00:42:11,695 --> 00:42:13,155
Oh, yeah. Okay.

782
00:42:13,239 --> 00:42:16,700
Oh, there we go. It's working now.

783
00:42:16,784 --> 00:42:20,955
It's working. I'm leaving. Bye!

784
00:42:22,790 --> 00:42:25,584
It's not working,
because you're looking. Stop looking!

785
00:42:25,668 --> 00:42:27,628
Michael, that door is not for you.

786
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:30,756
Why not? I invented the damn thing.

787
00:42:30,839 --> 00:42:32,007
You know, this stinks!

788
00:42:32,091 --> 00:42:35,135
You guys get to move on,
but I am trapped here forever?

789
00:42:35,219 --> 00:42:36,095
How is that fair?

790
00:42:36,178 --> 00:42:37,555
Oh! I got it!

791
00:42:37,638 --> 00:42:39,223
Eleanor, come here...

792
00:42:40,391 --> 00:42:43,185
You go through, and give me a piggy-back.
We can trick it.

793
00:42:43,269 --> 00:42:44,103
-[Eleanor] No.
-Michael.

794
00:42:44,186 --> 00:42:45,729
Ow! Michael, no!

795
00:42:45,813 --> 00:42:50,025
Michael! All right, come with me. [sighs]

796
00:42:50,109 --> 00:42:51,610
Fire squids are heavy!

797
00:42:51,694 --> 00:42:52,820
-[Janet] Yeah.
-[Michael] Sorry.

798
00:42:53,404 --> 00:42:55,948
New people are getting in all the time.

799
00:42:56,031 --> 00:42:59,201
Tahani's still around.
Maybe team up with her,

800
00:42:59,285 --> 00:43:01,996
-design some afterlife neighborhoods?
-I did that already, remember?

801
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:06,250
Spent 50 Bearimys making
new neighborhoods for new residents.

802
00:43:06,333 --> 00:43:09,670
When you've already designed
the ultimate one, it's kind of a letdown.

803
00:43:10,254 --> 00:43:14,258
I've loved being here,
but Jason's gone, Chidi's gone.

804
00:43:14,341 --> 00:43:17,303
You know, even Doug Forcett
went through the door.

805
00:43:17,386 --> 00:43:20,973
That was probably for the best.
That guy partied so hard when he was here.

806
00:43:21,056 --> 00:43:23,851
I guess I'll just stay here forever,
you know, putter around,

807
00:43:23,934 --> 00:43:27,313
doing mundane things,
like some sad, old retiree.

808
00:43:27,396 --> 00:43:30,357
Maybe I'll have Janet
make me a hardware store,

809
00:43:30,441 --> 00:43:33,611
so I can buy a hex wrench
that I don't really need.

810
00:43:35,070 --> 00:43:36,030
Cockamamie!

811
00:43:36,113 --> 00:43:39,617
That's what I think of your plan,
I think it's cockamamie!

812
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:43,037
I think it's a great plan,
and I bet deep down you do too.

813
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:45,247
-It sets a bad precedent.
-Babe!

814
00:43:45,331 --> 00:43:49,126
No one else is ever
gonna wanna do this. Plus, if they ask,

815
00:43:49,209 --> 00:43:52,254
you just say, "Sure, pal,
go save every soul in the universe

816
00:43:52,338 --> 00:43:53,172
and then we got a deal."

817
00:43:53,255 --> 00:43:54,715
And think about it this way,

818
00:43:54,798 --> 00:44:00,971
if you do this, you'll never have to
hear from any of us again ever again.

819
00:44:01,055 --> 00:44:02,056
Ooh.

820
00:44:03,015 --> 00:44:05,476
Now that is tempting,
'cause y'all are annoying.

821
00:44:05,559 --> 00:44:09,063
I mean, you did save the universe and all,
but your tone...

822
00:44:09,146 --> 00:44:10,147
It's your tone.

823
00:44:10,230 --> 00:44:11,273
I know.

824
00:44:12,858 --> 00:44:15,778
Michael, come on in.

825
00:44:21,241 --> 00:44:22,326
[Michael exclaims]

826
00:44:23,535 --> 00:44:25,704
All my Earth stuff!

827
00:44:26,830 --> 00:44:27,831
Oh!

828
00:44:27,915 --> 00:44:30,084
My old bowling ball.

829
00:44:30,167 --> 00:44:31,585
Oh!

830
00:44:31,669 --> 00:44:33,420
Hi, paper clips!

831
00:44:33,504 --> 00:44:35,047
What prompted all this?

832
00:44:35,130 --> 00:44:37,091
You know, it took me a while
to figure it out.

833
00:44:37,174 --> 00:44:41,762
But earlier when you were walking back
and forth through the door, it hit me.

834
00:44:41,845 --> 00:44:46,100
You will never be at peace until
you get the one thing you truly want.

835
00:44:49,144 --> 00:44:52,439
I'm... I'm gonna be...

836
00:44:52,523 --> 00:44:54,108
A real boy, Pinocchio.

837
00:44:54,191 --> 00:44:56,944
The Judge gave me the power
to make you an actual human.

838
00:44:57,528 --> 00:44:59,196
Goodbye, fire squid.

839
00:44:59,279 --> 00:45:01,156
Hello, silver fox.

840
00:45:01,990 --> 00:45:05,077
Oh, Eleanor! Oh, my goodness!

841
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:06,787
Now, you need to be sure about this.

842
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:09,665
You're gonna live down there for, like...

843
00:45:09,748 --> 00:45:12,000
some amount of time,
you'll die, really die,

844
00:45:12,084 --> 00:45:15,504
then you'll enter an afterlife test,
be judged on what you did, the whole deal.

845
00:45:15,587 --> 00:45:17,965
At least, so we think.

846
00:45:18,048 --> 00:45:21,051
While you're down there,
this entire system could be changed.

847
00:45:21,135 --> 00:45:23,804
Shawn might launch a coup.
Someone could design a whole new system.

848
00:45:23,887 --> 00:45:27,558
You won't really know
what's gonna happen to you.

849
00:45:28,475 --> 00:45:30,310
That's what makes it special.

850
00:45:30,394 --> 00:45:34,982
I won't exactly know
what's going to happen after I die.

851
00:45:35,691 --> 00:45:37,443
Nothing more human than that.

852
00:45:39,069 --> 00:45:41,822
Besides texting people
that you're five minutes away

853
00:45:41,905 --> 00:45:43,615
when you haven't even left the house.

854
00:45:46,535 --> 00:45:50,038
Thank you, Eleanor. Thank you.

855
00:45:53,041 --> 00:45:54,543
You're very welcome.

856
00:45:58,505 --> 00:46:02,301
-Hey, Mike. Where you headed today?
-Earth, actually.

857
00:46:02,384 --> 00:46:05,262
Oh! Been a while.
Here's the return clicker.

858
00:46:05,345 --> 00:46:07,639
No need. One-way trip.

859
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:09,725
Wow.

860
00:46:10,893 --> 00:46:12,060
Okay.

861
00:46:13,312 --> 00:46:14,146
Good luck.

862
00:46:14,229 --> 00:46:15,814
Thank you.

863
00:46:15,898 --> 00:46:17,608
-I have something for you.
-[Jeff] Uh-huh.

864
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:24,114
He's real!

865
00:46:24,198 --> 00:46:25,407
[Michael chuckles]

866
00:46:25,491 --> 00:46:27,159
It's real. He's a real frog!

867
00:46:27,242 --> 00:46:29,244
-Yes, it sure is.
-[Jeff laughs]

868
00:46:30,662 --> 00:46:31,580
Thank you.

869
00:46:31,663 --> 00:46:35,167
You know what?
I got the perfect name for him...

870
00:46:37,252 --> 00:46:38,504
Mr. Jumpy Legs.

871
00:46:39,379 --> 00:46:40,714
Oh.

872
00:46:40,797 --> 00:46:41,757
I thought you were gonna...

873
00:46:42,799 --> 00:46:43,884
Never mind.

874
00:46:45,177 --> 00:46:47,221
[chuckles] Hello, Mr. Jumpy Legs.

875
00:46:47,888 --> 00:46:53,060
Okay, so here's your driver's license
and your social security card.

876
00:46:53,143 --> 00:46:54,478
I set up a bank account for you.

877
00:46:54,561 --> 00:46:56,480
There's enough money in there
so you don't starve,

878
00:46:56,563 --> 00:46:58,857
but not so much
that you become an entitled jerk.

879
00:47:00,192 --> 00:47:01,068
Thank you, Janet.

880
00:47:01,151 --> 00:47:03,195
Make a doctor's appointment
as soon as you get down there.

881
00:47:03,278 --> 00:47:06,073
And no salty food. You have to keep
your blood pressure down.

882
00:47:06,156 --> 00:47:07,783
You have blood now.

883
00:47:08,367 --> 00:47:10,410
I'll be fine. I'll be okay.

884
00:47:11,203 --> 00:47:13,038
I know. I just worry.

885
00:47:17,167 --> 00:47:18,669
I'll see you again, you know.

886
00:47:19,962 --> 00:47:21,421
I'll see you when I get back.

887
00:47:23,882 --> 00:47:24,925
Okay.

888
00:47:31,348 --> 00:47:35,102
If you rent a car, don't pay
for the insurance, it's a scam. Okay.

889
00:47:45,988 --> 00:47:47,364
Man, it's hot.

890
00:47:49,116 --> 00:47:51,368
But it's a dry heat.

891
00:47:55,747 --> 00:47:59,876
So, as I mentioned before, you can sit
on this bench as long as you want.

892
00:48:01,003 --> 00:48:03,422
And whenever you're ready,
you just walk through.

893
00:48:04,923 --> 00:48:06,717
Care to join me for a bit?

894
00:48:11,597 --> 00:48:12,431
Margarita?

895
00:48:13,223 --> 00:48:14,057
Always.

896
00:48:19,855 --> 00:48:25,319
Okay, top three moments
of your not-life with us. Go.

897
00:48:25,902 --> 00:48:30,032
You telling us that we should try
to help other people on Earth.

898
00:48:30,115 --> 00:48:32,993
The moment that
we all got into the Good Place for real.

899
00:48:33,076 --> 00:48:37,748
And then it's an 8-million-way tie
of every time Jason and I kissed.

900
00:48:37,831 --> 00:48:38,665
He was a really good kisser.

901
00:48:38,749 --> 00:48:40,083
I bet he was.

902
00:48:42,836 --> 00:48:44,129
I wonder how Michael's doing?

903
00:48:44,838 --> 00:48:48,091
I assume he's doing the same
as every human.

904
00:48:48,175 --> 00:48:50,135
[all] Three, two, one...

905
00:48:50,218 --> 00:48:51,428
[Eleanor]<i> Some good days.</i>

906
00:48:51,511 --> 00:48:53,430
Happy New Year!

907
00:48:53,513 --> 00:48:55,349
[Eleanor]<i> Some bad days.</i>

908
00:48:55,432 --> 00:48:57,517
She's gonna be okay.

909
00:48:57,601 --> 00:48:59,895
This city has really good hospitals.

910
00:49:01,313 --> 00:49:02,773
[Eleanor]<i> He's got a few friends.</i>

911
00:49:02,856 --> 00:49:06,777
You're such a good boy, Jason.
Such a good boy.

912
00:49:06,860 --> 00:49:08,278
[cell phone vibrating]

913
00:49:08,362 --> 00:49:10,072
[Eleanor]<i> A few people he can't stand.</i>

914
00:49:10,155 --> 00:49:11,156
Oh...

915
00:49:14,493 --> 00:49:17,579
[Eleanor] <i>He's learning some things,</i>
<i>all by himself.</i>

916
00:49:19,164 --> 00:49:20,165
[laughs]

917
00:49:20,999 --> 00:49:24,169
<i>And, hopefully, learning to ask for help</i>
<i>when he needs it.</i>

918
00:49:25,587 --> 00:49:27,631
[woman] Try like this. Fingers this way.

919
00:49:32,469 --> 00:49:36,723
You have no idea how long I've been trying
to figure that out.

920
00:49:36,807 --> 00:49:40,560
Well, everybody needs a teacher.
So, do it again.

921
00:49:40,644 --> 00:49:43,939
[Eleanor] <i>He's messing up,</i>
<i>and trying again, and messing up again,</i>

922
00:49:44,022 --> 00:49:47,901
<i>and then getting things wrong,</i>
<i>and then trying to make them right.</i>

923
00:49:47,984 --> 00:49:50,362
That's what everyone does.

924
00:49:50,445 --> 00:49:52,781
-To Michael.
-To Michael.

925
00:49:52,864 --> 00:49:54,074
Mmm.

926
00:49:56,076 --> 00:49:58,161
What do you think happens
when people walk through the door?

927
00:49:58,745 --> 00:50:01,748
It's the only thing in the universe
I don't know.

928
00:50:01,832 --> 00:50:03,291
I don't know, either.

929
00:50:04,543 --> 00:50:06,503
The wave returns to the ocean.

930
00:50:07,671 --> 00:50:12,217
What the ocean does with the water
after that is anyone's guess.

931
00:50:13,009 --> 00:50:17,597
But as a very wise not-robot once told me,

932
00:50:18,181 --> 00:50:19,850
"The true joy is in the mystery."

933
00:50:21,727 --> 00:50:23,979
Do you mind
if I stay here until you're gone?

934
00:50:24,688 --> 00:50:26,440
Only if you say that thing I taught you.

935
00:50:28,233 --> 00:50:32,654
I hate to see you walk through
the final door at the edge of existence,

936
00:50:32,738 --> 00:50:34,698
but I love to watch you leave.

937
00:50:34,781 --> 00:50:35,615
There we go.

938
00:51:43,892 --> 00:51:46,937
Hey, this was delivered to my building
by mistake. I think it's yours.

939
00:51:47,020 --> 00:51:49,272
-Oh. Hey, thanks so much.
-Mmm-hmm.

940
00:51:50,232 --> 00:51:53,193
Oh, wow! I think I know what this is.

941
00:51:54,236 --> 00:51:55,529
[exclaims]

942
00:51:56,112 --> 00:51:58,448
Oh, my. Oh, my.

943
00:51:59,241 --> 00:52:05,247
Look at that. Oh, thank you.
Thank you so very, very much!

944
00:52:05,330 --> 00:52:07,707
Yeah, no problem. Take it easy.

945
00:52:07,791 --> 00:52:09,000
I'll do you one better.

946
00:52:10,961 --> 00:52:15,632
I'll say this to you, my friend,
with all the love in my heart,

947
00:52:15,715 --> 00:52:18,426
and all the wisdom of the universe.

948
00:52:20,387 --> 00:52:21,847
Take it sleazy.

949
00:52:22,722 --> 00:52:23,932
[chuckles]

950
00:52:25,851 --> 00:52:26,685
All right.
