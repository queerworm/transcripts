00:00:14,973 --> 00:00:16,182
[sighs]

3
00:00:16,266 --> 00:00:17,434
[door clicks open]

4
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:21,312
Eleanor? Come on in.

5
00:00:23,106 --> 00:00:24,941
Hi, Eleanor. I'm Michael.

6
00:00:26,067 --> 00:00:27,152
How are you today?

7
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:29,112
I'm great. Thanks for asking.

8
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:32,699
Oh, one question. Where am I?

9
00:00:32,782 --> 00:00:34,451
Who are you, and what's going on?

10
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:39,414
Right, so, you,
Eleanor Shellstrop, are dead.

11
00:00:39,789 --> 00:00:41,458
Your life on Earth has ended,

12
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:45,170
and you are now in the next phase
of your existence in the universe.

13
00:00:47,964 --> 00:00:51,718
Cool. Cool. I have some questions.

14
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:53,052
Thought you might. [chuckles]

15
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:55,722
How did I die? I don't remember.

16
00:00:55,847 --> 00:00:58,933
Yes, um, in cases of traumatic
or embarrassing deaths,

17
00:00:59,017 --> 00:01:03,480
we erase the memory to allow
for a peaceful transition.

18
00:01:03,938 --> 00:01:05,648
Are you sure you want to hear?

19
00:01:06,024 --> 00:01:09,360
All right, so you were
in a grocery store parking lot.

20
00:01:09,444 --> 00:01:14,115
You dropped a bottle of something called,
"Lonely Gal Margarita Mix for One."

21
00:01:14,407 --> 00:01:18,369
And when you bent down to pick it up,
a long column of shopping carts

22
00:01:19,245 --> 00:01:21,498
that were being returned to
the shopping cart collection area

23
00:01:21,956 --> 00:01:25,043
rolled out of control
and plowed right into you.

24
00:01:25,418 --> 00:01:28,755
-Oof. That's how I died?
-No, sorry, there's more.

25
00:01:29,214 --> 00:01:32,175
You were able to grab on to the front
of the column of shopping carts,

26
00:01:32,258 --> 00:01:34,302
but it'd swept you right out
into the street

27
00:01:34,385 --> 00:01:36,095
where you were struck and killed

28
00:01:36,179 --> 00:01:39,390
by a mobile billboard truck advertising

29
00:01:40,099 --> 00:01:43,186
an erectile dysfunction pill
called "Engorge-ulate."

30
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:47,357
Funnily enough, the first EMT to arrive
was an ex-boyfriend of yours--

31
00:01:47,524 --> 00:01:48,942
Okay, that's... I get it, thank you.

32
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:52,153
-Oh, okay, sorry.
-Um, so who was right?

33
00:01:53,029 --> 00:01:55,031
I mean about all of this?

34
00:01:55,448 --> 00:01:58,118
Well, let's see.
Hindus are a little bit right,

35
00:01:58,201 --> 00:02:02,080
Muslims a little bit.
Jews, Christians, Buddhists,

36
00:02:02,539 --> 00:02:05,416
every religion guessed about 5%,

37
00:02:05,875 --> 00:02:08,545
-except for Doug Forcett.
-Who's Doug Forcett?

38
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:13,466
Well, Doug was a stoner kid
who lived in Calgary during the 1970s.

39
00:02:13,883 --> 00:02:15,885
One night,
he got really high on mushrooms,

40
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:18,138
and his best friend, Randy, said,

41
00:02:18,513 --> 00:02:20,890
"Hey, what do you think
happens after we die?"

42
00:02:21,182 --> 00:02:24,602
And Doug just launched
into this long monologue

43
00:02:24,686 --> 00:02:27,230
where he got like 92% correct.

44
00:02:27,313 --> 00:02:29,983
[chuckles] I mean, we couldn't believe
what we were hearing.

45
00:02:30,066 --> 00:02:31,484
That's him, actually, right up there.

46
00:02:31,568 --> 00:02:33,278
{\an8}He's pretty famous around here.

47
00:02:33,945 --> 00:02:35,280
I'm very lucky to have that.

48
00:02:35,363 --> 00:02:36,531
-So...
-[chuckles]

49
00:02:36,614 --> 00:02:38,533
Maybe my biggest question. Am I...

50
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:40,535
I mean, is this...

51
00:02:42,912 --> 00:02:43,997
Or...

52
00:02:45,123 --> 00:02:50,086
Well, it's not the heaven-or-hell
idea that you were raised on.

53
00:02:50,795 --> 00:02:53,882
But generally speaking, in the afterlife,

54
00:02:53,965 --> 00:02:57,051
there's a Good Place
and there's a Bad Place.

55
00:02:58,761 --> 00:03:00,138
You're in The Good Place.

56
00:03:00,722 --> 00:03:02,765
-[exhales sharply]
-You're okay, Eleanor.

57
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:04,392
You're in The Good Place.

58
00:03:04,559 --> 00:03:05,894
Well, that's good.

59
00:03:06,102 --> 00:03:07,854
Sure is. [laughs]

60
00:03:07,979 --> 00:03:10,023
Okay, let's take a walk, shall we?

61
00:03:12,358 --> 00:03:16,613
Oh, did I have a purse?
No, I'm dead, right. Okay.

62
00:03:21,743 --> 00:03:23,119
So, this is how it works.

63
00:03:23,202 --> 00:03:26,414
{\an8}The Good Place is divided
into distinct neighborhoods.

64
00:03:26,664 --> 00:03:30,293
Each one contains exactly 322 people

65
00:03:30,376 --> 00:03:32,170
{\an8}who have been perfectly selected

66
00:03:32,253 --> 00:03:36,007
{\an8}to blend together into
a blissful harmonic balance.

67
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:38,343
{\an8}Do all the neighborhoods look like this?

68
00:03:38,426 --> 00:03:42,180
{\an8}No, every neighborhood is unique.
Some have warm weather, some cold.

69
00:03:42,263 --> 00:03:44,182
{\an8}Some are cities, some farmland.

70
00:03:44,265 --> 00:03:47,143
{\an8}But in each one, every blade of grass,

71
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:50,396
{\an8}every ladybug, every detail has been

72
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,900
{\an8}precisely designed and calibrated
for its residents.

73
00:03:53,983 --> 00:03:56,402
{\an8}There's a lot of frozen yogurt places.

74
00:03:56,486 --> 00:03:57,862
{\an8}Yeah. [sighs]

75
00:03:57,946 --> 00:03:59,781
{\an8}That's the one thing we put
in all the neighborhoods.

76
00:03:59,864 --> 00:04:03,284
People love frozen yogurt.
I don't know what to tell you.

77
00:04:04,202 --> 00:04:06,287
{\an8}You're gonna have a million
more questions, I know.

78
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:08,957
{\an8}For right now, better grab a seat.

79
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,667
{\an8}Movie's about to begin.

80
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:13,628
{\an8}[indistinct chatter]

[audience applauding]

122
00:06:08,826 --> 00:06:11,412
So who is in The Bad Place
that would shock me?

123
00:06:11,496 --> 00:06:15,583
Uh... Well, Mozart, Picasso, Elvis,

124
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:17,627
basically every artist ever,

125
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:20,213
uh, every US president except Lincoln.

126
00:06:20,296 --> 00:06:23,007
[Eleanor] That sounds about right.
What about Florence Nightingale?

127
00:06:23,091 --> 00:06:25,093
[Michael] It was close,
but, no, she didn't make it.

128
00:06:25,176 --> 00:06:29,847
Wow, all those amazing people down there,
it just seems so hard to believe.

129
00:06:29,931 --> 00:06:33,226
Again, it's an incredibly
selective system.

130
00:06:33,309 --> 00:06:34,936
Most people don't make it here.

131
00:06:35,561 --> 00:06:39,690
But you, a lawyer who got
innocent people off death row,

132
00:06:39,774 --> 00:06:41,692
you're special, Eleanor.

133
00:06:42,527 --> 00:06:46,030
And by the way, welcome to your new home.

134
00:06:46,864 --> 00:06:48,783
-[Michael] Oh, it's perfect, isn't it?
-[gasps]

135
00:06:48,866 --> 00:06:50,284
You see, in The Good Place,

136
00:06:50,368 --> 00:06:55,248
every person gets to live in a home that
perfectly matches his or her true essence.

137
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:57,333
Cool.

138
00:06:57,416 --> 00:07:00,211
So I guess that's why
my house, for example,

139
00:07:00,294 --> 00:07:02,296
is this adorable little cottage,

140
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:05,258
whereas other people might
have homes that are bigger,

141
00:07:05,758 --> 00:07:07,176
like that one.

142
00:07:07,718 --> 00:07:10,471
[Michael] Exactly.
Oh, I'm so happy you get it.

143
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:15,435
As you can see, the interior has been
decorated just as you like it,

144
00:07:15,518 --> 00:07:17,770
in the Icelandic primitive style.

145
00:07:18,604 --> 00:07:22,525
Oh, oh, and, uh, of course,
you love clowns, so...

146
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,736
I do love clowns.

147
00:07:25,903 --> 00:07:28,990
Now, let me show you the, uh,
the video system here.

148
00:07:29,782 --> 00:07:31,367
[shimmering tone]

149
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:34,245
You can review everything
that happened in your life

150
00:07:34,328 --> 00:07:35,580
from your point of view.

151
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:37,915
There we go.

152
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:40,585
This is your human rights
mission to Ukraine.

153
00:07:41,335 --> 00:07:42,920
I mean, you got
a ton of points for that one.

154
00:07:43,004 --> 00:07:44,714
It really put you over the top.

155
00:07:45,673 --> 00:07:46,966
Oh.

156
00:07:47,049 --> 00:07:48,676
Chidi, come on in.

157
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:53,431
Eleanor? I'm Chidi Anagonye,

158
00:07:53,848 --> 00:07:56,142
and you are my soulmate.

159
00:07:58,227 --> 00:08:00,646
Cool! Bring it in, man.

160
00:08:00,897 --> 00:08:03,649
Now, excuse me.
I have other people to attend to.

161
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:05,943
So where you from, Chidi?

162
00:08:06,194 --> 00:08:09,530
Well, I was born in Nigeria,
raised in Senegal,

163
00:08:09,614 --> 00:08:11,741
but my work took me all over the place.

164
00:08:11,824 --> 00:08:14,035
Australia, Hong Kong, Paris.

165
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:16,120
What about you?

166
00:08:16,204 --> 00:08:18,664
Uh, well, I... I was born in Phoenix.

167
00:08:18,748 --> 00:08:20,041
-Mmm-hmm.
-Arizona.

168
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:22,877
And then I went to school
in Tempe, Arizona.

169
00:08:23,085 --> 00:08:26,380
And then I moved back to Phoenix, Arizona.

170
00:08:28,549 --> 00:08:29,842
Your English is amazing.

171
00:08:30,301 --> 00:08:32,845
Oh! I'm actually speaking French.

172
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:35,556
This place just translates
whatever you say

173
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:38,142
into a language the other person
can understand.

174
00:08:38,226 --> 00:08:40,019
-So it's incredible.
-Whoa.

175
00:08:40,102 --> 00:08:42,855
-And now I want to say this.
-Mmm-kay.

176
00:08:43,314 --> 00:08:44,440
Eleanor.

177
00:08:44,732 --> 00:08:49,904
I have spent my entire life in pursuit
of fundamental truths about the universe.

178
00:08:50,071 --> 00:08:54,992
And now we can actually learn about them
together as soulmates.

179
00:08:56,244 --> 00:08:57,787
It's overwhelming.

180
00:08:59,413 --> 00:09:03,000
Chidi. You'll stand by my side
no matter what, right?

181
00:09:03,251 --> 00:09:07,338
-Of course I will.
-Promise me. Say, "I promise

182
00:09:07,421 --> 00:09:10,591
I will never betray you for any reason."

183
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:11,801
Eleanor, I swear

184
00:09:11,884 --> 00:09:15,763
that I will never say or do anything

185
00:09:15,846 --> 00:09:17,765
to cause you any harm.

186
00:09:17,848 --> 00:09:18,933
Good.

187
00:09:19,267 --> 00:09:20,810
Because those aren't my memories.

188
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:22,937
I wasn't a lawyer.
I never went to the Ukraine.

189
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:25,189
I hate clowns.

190
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:27,108
There's been a big mistake.

191
00:09:28,276 --> 00:09:30,361
I'm not supposed to be here.

192
00:09:34,156 --> 00:09:35,324
Wait, what?

193
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:46,335
Are you sure this isn't you?

194
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:50,172
Yeah, man, I'm pretty sure
I wasn't a death-row lawyer

195
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:53,467
who collected clown paintings
and rescued orphans.

196
00:09:53,551 --> 00:09:55,720
They got my name right, but nothing else.

197
00:09:55,803 --> 00:09:58,431
I mean, somebody royally
forked up. [chuckles]

198
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:00,933
Somebody forked up.

199
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:02,935
Why can't I say "fork"?

200
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:04,729
If you're trying to curse, you can't here.

201
00:10:04,812 --> 00:10:06,564
I guess a lot of people
in this neighborhood

202
00:10:06,647 --> 00:10:08,190
don't like it, so it's prohibited.

203
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:09,275
That's bull-shirt.

204
00:10:09,358 --> 00:10:13,029
So, if you're not this person,
then who are you?

205
00:10:13,112 --> 00:10:14,363
What did you do for a living?

206
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:17,158
I was... In...

207
00:10:17,241 --> 00:10:18,284
Sales.

208
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:21,495
So we sell two products here,
NasaPRO and NasaPRO Silver.

209
00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:22,705
We aim this at seniors.

210
00:10:22,913 --> 00:10:24,999
Now, you can't legally call it "medicine"

211
00:10:25,207 --> 00:10:28,169
because it doesn't technically work

212
00:10:28,252 --> 00:10:32,298
and it is technically chalk,
so what you're gonna want to do--

213
00:10:32,381 --> 00:10:35,343
You need me to lie to old people
and scare them into buying fake medicine.

214
00:10:35,426 --> 00:10:37,345
I get it, man. Which one's my desk?

215
00:10:38,346 --> 00:10:42,683
So your job was to defraud the elderly...

216
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:45,144
Sorry, the sick and elderly?

217
00:10:45,227 --> 00:10:46,395
But I was very good at it.

218
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:48,814
I was the top salesperson
five years running.

219
00:10:48,898 --> 00:10:49,982
Okay, but that's worse.

220
00:10:50,274 --> 00:10:52,526
I mean, you, you do get how that's worse,

221
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:54,070
right?

222
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:58,491
You know, maybe it's a test.

223
00:10:58,574 --> 00:11:01,160
Maybe if you go to Michael
and you tell him the truth,

224
00:11:01,369 --> 00:11:02,828
you'll pass the test

225
00:11:02,912 --> 00:11:04,413
-and you'll get to stay.
-No way.

226
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:06,040
I can't risk going to The Bad Place.

227
00:11:06,248 --> 00:11:09,335
Okay, well, maybe it's not actually, like,
all that bad.

228
00:11:09,543 --> 00:11:11,212
Let's just get some information first.

229
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:12,880
We'll ask Janet. Hey, Janet?

230
00:11:12,963 --> 00:11:14,173
-Hi there.
-[exclaims]

231
00:11:14,256 --> 00:11:15,174
How can I help you?

232
00:11:15,257 --> 00:11:16,675
What the fork? Who are you?

233
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:18,135
I'm Janet.

234
00:11:18,219 --> 00:11:20,471
I'm the informational assistant
here in The Good Place.

235
00:11:20,554 --> 00:11:22,848
She's like this walking database.

236
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:26,894
You can ask her about
the creation of the universe, or history--

237
00:11:26,977 --> 00:11:31,065
Oh, there was a guy who lived
in Avondale, Arizona, around 2002.

238
00:11:31,148 --> 00:11:32,983
His name was Kevin Paltonic.

239
00:11:33,067 --> 00:11:34,527
-Is he gay?
-No.

240
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:36,278
Really?

241
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:38,489
Huh. I guess he just didn't want
to have sex with me.

242
00:11:38,572 --> 00:11:39,698
That's correct.

243
00:11:39,782 --> 00:11:41,742
Well, that's fine,
I wasn't that into him anyway.

244
00:11:41,826 --> 00:11:43,994
-Yes, you were.
-Okay, Janet, I have a question.

245
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:47,248
-Okay.
-What is The Bad Place like?

246
00:11:47,415 --> 00:11:51,335
Oh, sorry, that is the one topic
I'm not allowed to tell you about.

247
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:56,340
I can only play you a brief audio clip
of what is happening there right now.

248
00:11:56,424 --> 00:11:57,967
Okay.

249
00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:00,010
[people screaming]

250
00:12:00,094 --> 00:12:02,596
[woman] <i>The bear has two mouths!</i>

251
00:12:04,306 --> 00:12:06,267
Well, it doesn't sound awesome.

252
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:11,480
Does everyone have a huge house except me?

253
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:13,149
All right, we need a plan.

254
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:15,860
I say we just lie low
and hope that they don't notice me.

255
00:12:15,943 --> 00:12:17,570
I'm sorry, I don't think I can help you.

256
00:12:17,653 --> 00:12:19,238
I just don't like being dishonest,

257
00:12:19,321 --> 00:12:22,450
and I can't advise you
to be dishonest either.

258
00:12:22,533 --> 00:12:24,994
Come on, I'm just asking
you to fudge a little bit.

259
00:12:25,286 --> 00:12:27,413
You must've told a few
white lies in your life.

260
00:12:27,496 --> 00:12:28,956
I mean, what was your job?

261
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:31,500
I was a professor of ethics
and moral philosophy.

262
00:12:32,042 --> 00:12:33,711
Mother-forker!

263
00:12:34,128 --> 00:12:35,921
-I'm getting a stomachache.
-[sighs]

264
00:12:36,005 --> 00:12:37,882
I'm in a perfect utopia,

265
00:12:37,965 --> 00:12:40,301
and I'm... I have a stomachache.
This is awful.

266
00:12:40,634 --> 00:12:43,012
I, uh... I think I have to
tell Michael about this.

267
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:44,472
[Michael] Tell Michael about what?

268
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:46,182
[Eleanor] Michael? Hi.

269
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:48,058
What have you been up to?

270
00:12:48,142 --> 00:12:52,229
Eleanor, Chidi, I would like you to meet
Tahani and Jianyu.

271
00:12:52,313 --> 00:12:55,065
They are soulmates
and your next-door neighbors.

272
00:12:55,691 --> 00:12:56,817
Hello.

273
00:12:56,901 --> 00:12:59,320
Can I just say I love your house?

274
00:12:59,653 --> 00:13:02,865
It's just so tiny and cute.

275
00:13:02,948 --> 00:13:06,202
It's like a little child's plaything,
like for a family of mice

276
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:08,329
or for a very fancy little dog.

277
00:13:08,412 --> 00:13:11,957
I love it. It's just so sweet and teensy.

278
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:14,293
Just like you. Boop.

279
00:13:14,376 --> 00:13:15,544
-Oh!
-Oh!

280
00:13:15,711 --> 00:13:17,254
You booped me. [laughs]

281
00:13:17,338 --> 00:13:18,797
-I did.
-That's fun.

282
00:13:19,048 --> 00:13:20,633
Tahani and Jianyu are having a little

283
00:13:20,716 --> 00:13:24,470
welcome party tonight, and they've invited
the entire neighborhood.

284
00:13:24,762 --> 00:13:26,972
Oh, I simply adore entertaining.

285
00:13:27,056 --> 00:13:28,933
Don't I just adore it, Jianyu?

286
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:34,146
Oh, yes, by the way,
Jianyu here is a Buddhist monk, you see,

287
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:36,857
and he obeys a strict code of silence.

288
00:13:37,274 --> 00:13:39,652
So when you see him smiling and nodding,

289
00:13:39,735 --> 00:13:42,696
that's actually his way of
jumping up and down with glee.

290
00:13:43,113 --> 00:13:44,532
Isn't that right, darling?

291
00:13:46,242 --> 00:13:47,493
So we'll see you tonight?

292
00:13:47,576 --> 00:13:48,702
-Great.
-Yes.

293
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:51,539
[classical music playing]

294
00:13:51,872 --> 00:13:54,291
-[chuckles]
-No way.

295
00:13:58,128 --> 00:13:59,922
My entire house could fit in this room.

296
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:02,341
Okay, uh...

297
00:14:02,424 --> 00:14:03,342
Help me out here.

298
00:14:03,425 --> 00:14:06,387
Tell me one good thing
that you did on Earth,

299
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:10,224
just one truly kind and decent act

300
00:14:10,307 --> 00:14:13,102
so that I can feel better
about helping you out.

301
00:14:13,185 --> 00:14:14,895
Uh...

302
00:14:15,729 --> 00:14:17,022
Let's forget about good.

303
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:19,066
Um, just tell me something
neutral about yourself.

304
00:14:19,149 --> 00:14:21,068
Like, tell me about
the day before you died.

305
00:14:21,151 --> 00:14:22,236
What do you remember?

306
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:26,657
Hi there. Do you have a second
to talk about the environment?

307
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:28,325
Do you have a second to eat my farts?

308
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:30,286
You missed.

309
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:32,872
[scoffs] Pick it up
if you're so horny for the environment.

310
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:35,499
I don't remember anything specific.

311
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:36,959
-Oh...
-Look.

312
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:40,212
I might not have been a saint,
but it's not like I killed anybody.

313
00:14:40,296 --> 00:14:41,589
I wasn't an arsonist.

314
00:14:41,672 --> 00:14:43,507
I never found a wallet outside of an IHOP

315
00:14:43,591 --> 00:14:46,093
and thought about returning it but
saw the owner lived out of state

316
00:14:46,176 --> 00:14:49,138
so just took the cash
and dropped the wallet back on the ground.

317
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:50,431
Okay, that's really specific,

318
00:14:50,514 --> 00:14:52,558
and that makes me think that
you definitely did do that.

319
00:14:52,641 --> 00:14:56,562
All I'm saying is
these people might be "good,"

320
00:14:57,187 --> 00:14:59,565
but are they really
that much better than me?

321
00:15:00,858 --> 00:15:02,943
Well, I spent half my life in North Korea

322
00:15:03,027 --> 00:15:06,196
fighting for women's rights
and the other half in Saudi Arabia

323
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,615
fighting for gay rights.

324
00:15:07,698 --> 00:15:10,701
So we said, "If the UN
won't remove those land mines, we will."

325
00:15:11,201 --> 00:15:13,621
And we dug up over a thousand
unexploded land mines

326
00:15:13,704 --> 00:15:15,414
from the area surrounding the orphanage.

327
00:15:15,664 --> 00:15:16,916
Well, then he said,

328
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:18,542
"You can't give me both
your kidneys, you'll die."

329
00:15:18,876 --> 00:15:20,711
And I said, "But you will live."

330
00:15:20,794 --> 00:15:23,964
And I know we just met on this bus
ten minutes ago, but he seemed nice.

331
00:15:24,048 --> 00:15:26,300
Oh, forget it. Heading to the bar!

332
00:15:27,426 --> 00:15:29,970
-[clinking glass]
-[applauding]

333
00:15:30,387 --> 00:15:32,097
Thank you, thank you.

334
00:15:32,556 --> 00:15:35,643
You all know that I am the
architect of this neighborhood.

335
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:37,561
But what you don't know is...

336
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:40,814
Golly, I'm not supposed
to tell you this, but, um...

337
00:15:41,315 --> 00:15:42,733
Oh, what the heck?

338
00:15:43,233 --> 00:15:45,402
This is actually
the very first neighborhood

339
00:15:45,486 --> 00:15:47,112
that I have ever designed.

340
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:50,282
I had been an apprentice
for over 200 years,

341
00:15:50,741 --> 00:15:54,828
and my boss has finally given me
my first solo project.

342
00:15:54,912 --> 00:15:56,038
-[crowd exclaims]
-[chuckles]

343
00:15:56,121 --> 00:15:57,998
Yes! [laughs]

344
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:01,335
Ah, ah, ah. Hold on there, ace.

345
00:16:01,418 --> 00:16:03,003
Let me get more of them shrampies.

346
00:16:03,087 --> 00:16:04,505
-Okay, easy.
-What?

347
00:16:04,588 --> 00:16:06,715
-They're for everybody, right?
-Yes, exactly.

348
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:09,927
[Michael] And you deserve a perfect world

349
00:16:10,386 --> 00:16:12,930
because every single one of you

350
00:16:13,847 --> 00:16:14,890
is a good person.

351
00:16:15,724 --> 00:16:17,768
That's it for me. Back to you, Tahani.

352
00:16:18,435 --> 00:16:21,063
-Bravo, Michael, bravo!
-Thank you.

353
00:16:21,146 --> 00:16:23,232
And I would just like to quickly say

354
00:16:23,315 --> 00:16:25,526
if any of you would like
to play tennis tonight,

355
00:16:25,609 --> 00:16:29,029
we have 36 regulation grass tennis courts.

356
00:16:29,113 --> 00:16:31,407
Such fun. Cheers. [laughs]

357
00:16:32,616 --> 00:16:35,202
Tahani, what a condescending bench.

358
00:16:35,285 --> 00:16:36,829
-Okay, okay, okay, okay.
-Am I right?

359
00:16:36,912 --> 00:16:38,914
Why does she still have
that British accent, right?

360
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:40,541
No one else here has an accent.

361
00:16:40,624 --> 00:16:42,292
-She's choosing to have that accent.
-[shushes]

362
00:16:42,376 --> 00:16:45,254
[imitating Tahani] "Oh, hello.

363
00:16:45,337 --> 00:16:49,550
I am just a big, beautiful,
utterly perfect cartoon giraffe."

364
00:16:49,633 --> 00:16:53,095
Oh, okay. Okay.
I think it's time to go home.

365
00:16:53,178 --> 00:16:55,097
Wait, wait, wait.
I just have to go upstairs

366
00:16:55,305 --> 00:16:57,433
real quick and steal
a bunch of gold stuff.

367
00:16:57,516 --> 00:16:59,059
Okay, don't do that.

368
00:17:00,477 --> 00:17:02,604
Don't do... No, Eleanor, Eleanor, Eleanor.

369
00:17:05,566 --> 00:17:07,568
Hello, creepy house that I hate.

370
00:17:08,485 --> 00:17:10,362
Hello, one million clowns.

371
00:17:12,114 --> 00:17:14,199
Why aren't there stairs here?

372
00:17:15,826 --> 00:17:17,036
[grunts]

373
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:19,496
What kind of weirdo house is this?

374
00:17:20,414 --> 00:17:21,623
Ooh.

375
00:17:22,499 --> 00:17:25,294
Did you fill your bra with shrimp?

376
00:17:25,669 --> 00:17:27,046
No. [hiccups]

377
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:28,756
Yes.

378
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:30,799
Whatever, it's freakin' heaven.

379
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:33,135
I'm sure they have plenty of shellfish.

380
00:17:33,969 --> 00:17:36,055
That Tahani is a real butthead, huh?

381
00:17:36,138 --> 00:17:37,639
[gasps] Hey.

382
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:39,600
At least I can still say "butthead."

383
00:17:39,808 --> 00:17:41,560
Oh, she is a butthead.

384
00:17:42,227 --> 00:17:43,437
Found some pajamas.

385
00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:47,900
Chidi... Chidi, Chidi?

386
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:51,070
I'm sorry that you had
to deal with this...

387
00:17:52,946 --> 00:17:54,031
It's okay.

388
00:17:54,114 --> 00:17:56,450
It's not, though. [sighs]

389
00:17:56,533 --> 00:17:58,619
Do you think anybody cared that I died?

390
00:17:59,286 --> 00:18:02,164
Maybe someone did. I don't know.

391
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:03,874
I was an only child.

392
00:18:03,957 --> 00:18:06,126
My parents were divorced when I was a kid.

393
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:10,214
They were both crummy people,
so they're probably... [exclaims]

394
00:18:10,297 --> 00:18:11,924
In The Bad Place.

395
00:18:12,216 --> 00:18:14,301
Maybe they're being used
to torture each other.

396
00:18:15,803 --> 00:18:17,596
-It would work.
-[chuckles]

397
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:20,557
I bet way more people cared that you died.

398
00:18:21,809 --> 00:18:24,895
'Cause you're a nice person.
[clears throat]

399
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:27,272
You're a nice person, Chidi...

400
00:18:28,065 --> 00:18:29,233
Anaconda.

401
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:33,237
-"Anagonye."
-Aganocomonga.

402
00:18:33,487 --> 00:18:34,780
"Anagonye."

403
00:18:34,863 --> 00:18:36,615
-Ags... say it again.
-"Anagonye."

404
00:18:36,698 --> 00:18:39,284
-No, say what you said before.
-I did. It's Anagonye.

405
00:18:39,493 --> 00:18:41,954
-You just changed it.
-I didn't change it, it's my name.

406
00:18:42,037 --> 00:18:43,956
Argrugande. Ariana Grande.

407
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:45,457
[gasps] That's a person.

408
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:46,583
I did it.

409
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:48,752
Good night.

410
00:18:50,295 --> 00:18:51,463
Good night.

411
00:18:53,924 --> 00:18:55,592
[circus music playing]

412
00:18:57,553 --> 00:18:58,929
[recorded cheering]

413
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:01,181
Well, that's terrifying.

414
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,475
-[snoring]
-[birds cawing]

415
00:19:04,351 --> 00:19:05,602
[lightning crackles]

416
00:19:07,312 --> 00:19:09,398
[birds cawing]

417
00:19:10,399 --> 00:19:11,692
[lightning crackles]

418
00:19:12,776 --> 00:19:14,278
That can't be good.

419
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:19,283
["Break Free" playing]

420
00:19:26,957 --> 00:19:29,001
[Eleanor] Oh, fork.

421
00:19:41,221 --> 00:19:42,556
-Michael.
-Hmm?

422
00:19:42,639 --> 00:19:45,893
Is that giant, terrifying ladybug
supposed to be there?

423
00:19:45,976 --> 00:19:48,395
Ah. Well, great question, Tahani.

424
00:19:48,478 --> 00:19:49,855
No. No, it's not.

425
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:53,358
I have no idea why any of this
is happening or how to control it.

426
00:19:53,609 --> 00:19:55,027
Should we run away then?

427
00:19:55,611 --> 00:19:56,778
Yes.

428
00:19:57,738 --> 00:19:58,947
Righto.

429
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:03,744
[growls]

430
00:20:17,591 --> 00:20:20,469
Chidi, Chidi! What's going on?

431
00:20:20,552 --> 00:20:22,179
Why are there giant animals everywhere?

432
00:20:22,596 --> 00:20:25,057
Do you hear Ariana Grande playing?

433
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:27,726
Why is everyone wearing blue and yellow?

434
00:20:28,644 --> 00:20:29,811
You're not.

435
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:32,731
You're the only one who's not.

436
00:20:32,814 --> 00:20:35,984
Eleanor, this is all happening
because of you.

437
00:20:37,027 --> 00:20:38,487
Oh, fork me.

438
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:43,492
Okay, okay.
We don't know this is because of me.

439
00:20:43,575 --> 00:20:46,453
Eleanor, this place is
a perfectly made Swiss watch,

440
00:20:46,536 --> 00:20:48,330
and you are a wrench in the gears.

441
00:20:48,413 --> 00:20:51,667
Actually, you're a hammer,
just smashing the gears into dust.

442
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:54,920
Oh, hang on.
Not everybody here is perfect, okay?

443
00:20:55,003 --> 00:20:56,546
Tahani is totally condescending.

444
00:20:56,630 --> 00:21:00,217
And there are a couple of,
you know, chunksters.

445
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:01,510
Oh, come on!

446
00:21:01,593 --> 00:21:03,512
No judgment. I'm just saying

447
00:21:03,595 --> 00:21:07,808
I'm not the only one with flaws.
So how can we be sure this is my fault?

448
00:21:07,891 --> 00:21:11,061
You hogged all the shrimp,
and now there are shrimp flying around.

449
00:21:11,561 --> 00:21:14,856
You called Tahani a giraffe,
and now there are giraffes everywhere.

450
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:17,401
Okay, fine, turns out there are many ways
to know that it was me.

451
00:21:17,484 --> 00:21:19,486
Let's just face it, Eleanor,
you don't belong here.

452
00:21:22,197 --> 00:21:24,449
Well, then this system sucks.

453
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:27,035
What, one in a million
gets to live in paradise

454
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:29,288
and everyone else
is tortured for eternity?

455
00:21:29,371 --> 00:21:30,455
Come on.

456
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:34,376
I mean, I wasn't freaking Gandhi,
but I was okay.

457
00:21:34,459 --> 00:21:37,504
I was a medium person.

458
00:21:37,587 --> 00:21:40,382
I should get to spend eternity
in a medium place!

459
00:21:40,465 --> 00:21:42,050
Like Cincinnati.

460
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:44,303
Everyone who wasn't perfect
but wasn't terrible

461
00:21:44,386 --> 00:21:46,430
should get to spend eternity
in Cincinnati.

462
00:21:46,513 --> 00:21:48,557
Look, apparently it doesn't work that way.

463
00:21:49,057 --> 00:21:52,728
I'm sorry, Eleanor,
but there's nothing anyone can do.

464
00:21:54,521 --> 00:21:55,897
Unless...

465
00:21:56,690 --> 00:22:00,819
There is something we can do.
Unless you could teach me.

466
00:22:01,778 --> 00:22:03,864
-Teach you what?
-How to be good.

467
00:22:04,197 --> 00:22:07,576
{\an8}That was your job, right?
A professor of ethics?

468
00:22:07,659 --> 00:22:09,870
{\an8}No one knew I was a problem
when I arrived.

469
00:22:09,953 --> 00:22:11,455
{\an8}Things only started getting crazy

470
00:22:11,538 --> 00:22:14,499
{\an8}after I was an ash-hole
to everyone at the party. Ugh.

471
00:22:15,083 --> 00:22:18,628
{\an8}You know I'm trying to say "ash-hole"
and not "ash-hole," right?

472
00:22:18,712 --> 00:22:19,880
{\an8}I got that, yes.

473
00:22:19,963 --> 00:22:23,216
{\an8}Okay, give me a chance.
Let me earn my place here.

474
00:22:23,383 --> 00:22:26,887
{\an8}-Let me be your ethical guinea pig.
-[knocking on door]

475
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:30,057
{\an8}[Michael] Hey, guys! Uh...
Emergency neighborhood meeting, now!

476
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:31,516
{\an8}We'll be right there, Michael!

477
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:34,436
{\an8}If I walk out of here in these clothes,
I'm toast.

478
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:38,273
My soul is in your hands, soulmate.
What's it gonna be?

479
00:22:38,774 --> 00:22:40,233
[knocking continues]

480
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:43,820
-[thunder rumbling]
-Oh, stomachache.
