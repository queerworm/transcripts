1
00:00:11,594 --> 00:00:13,388
Oh, hi, dip-shirt.

2
00:00:13,471 --> 00:00:15,640
Hello, Bad Janet. How are you today?

3
00:00:15,724 --> 00:00:16,558
Terrible.

4
00:00:17,475 --> 00:00:21,187
I'm here to let you know
that after six months of captivity,

5
00:00:21,271 --> 00:00:25,275
here in Good Janet's void,
today's your last day.

6
00:00:25,358 --> 00:00:26,901
I'm gonna tell you a story.

7
00:00:26,985 --> 00:00:29,696
And once that's done,
I'm getting rid of you.

8
00:00:29,779 --> 00:00:31,281
[scoffs] Wow.

9
00:00:31,364 --> 00:00:34,367
Sounds like someone finally put on
his big-boy demon pants.

10
00:00:34,951 --> 00:00:36,119
So, what's the story?

11
00:00:36,202 --> 00:00:37,203
Another one of your attempts to prove

12
00:00:37,287 --> 00:00:40,832
that humans are "good"
and "worthy of respect"

13
00:00:40,915 --> 00:00:44,377
and not "big fat sacks of dookie"?

14
00:00:44,461 --> 00:00:45,587
Something like that.

15
00:00:46,421 --> 00:00:47,255
Are you ready?

16
00:00:47,338 --> 00:00:49,466
One thing, real quick, before you start...

17
00:00:50,258 --> 00:00:52,051
[farting loudly]

18
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:57,932
[theme music playing]

19
00:01:02,312 --> 00:01:04,314
[farting continues]

20
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:05,899
Wow.

21
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:07,817
She's gonna last.

22
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:09,944
{\an8}Is that your story? Looks boring.

23
00:01:10,028 --> 00:01:12,739
{\an8}This book is a part of the story.
You'll see.

24
00:01:12,822 --> 00:01:16,242
{\an8}-[sighing] Ugh.
-It all started about a week ago.

25
00:01:16,326 --> 00:01:18,870
{\an8}We'd sent the four humans on a ski trip...

26
00:01:18,953 --> 00:01:21,998
{\an8}And they all skied off a cliff
and they broke all their bones

27
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:25,752
{\an8}and their pants fell down
and you could see their butts. The end.

28
00:01:25,835 --> 00:01:29,088
{\an8}Actually, it went better
than we could've possibly hoped.

29
00:01:29,172 --> 00:01:30,215
{\an8}[indistinct chatter]

30
00:01:30,715 --> 00:01:33,134
{\an8}Well, I admit it. I was wrong.

31
00:01:33,218 --> 00:01:35,136
{\an8}That was super fun!

32
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:36,930
{\an8}Yeah! I mean,
I couldn't actually go skiing,

33
00:01:37,013 --> 00:01:39,808
{\an8}because moving at an angle terrifies me,

34
00:01:39,891 --> 00:01:42,352
{\an8}-but that lodge had so many reading nooks.
-[Brent chuckles]

35
00:01:42,435 --> 00:01:44,646
{\an8}[chuckles] Just everywhere
you look... nook.

36
00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:47,774
{\an8}Plus Jianyu guided us
on that amazing meditation.

37
00:01:47,857 --> 00:01:49,984
{\an8}Oh, do you guys want to share
what your mantra is?

38
00:01:50,068 --> 00:01:53,321
{\an8}Mine is Cate Blanchett saying, "Rihanna."

39
00:01:53,404 --> 00:01:55,448
Congrats again, on the gin rummy win.

40
00:01:55,532 --> 00:01:56,991
I thought I was gonna take you down,

41
00:01:57,075 --> 00:01:58,743
'cause I used to play all the time
back in college.

42
00:01:58,827 --> 00:01:59,994
Ah, you went to Rutgers, right?

43
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:01,246
No, I went to Princeton.

44
00:02:01,329 --> 00:02:03,123
Yeah, I know. I'm messing with you.

45
00:02:03,206 --> 00:02:04,332
{\an8}[laughing] Oh.

46
00:02:04,415 --> 00:02:06,501
{\an8}Nice one.
Hey, you were joking, though, right?

47
00:02:06,584 --> 00:02:08,586
{\an8}You know it's Prince... Yeah, you know.

48
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:11,589
{\an8}Okay, team. Well done.

49
00:02:11,673 --> 00:02:15,426
{\an8}They're all kinda killing it, but Brent
has definitely made the most progress.

50
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:19,806
Yeah, when Simone beat him at cards,
he didn't flip the table and storm off.

51
00:02:19,889 --> 00:02:21,599
He just stormed off. That's big.

52
00:02:21,683 --> 00:02:23,977
Well, we still don't know
if he's really changed,

53
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:25,770
or if he's just trying
to get into "super heaven."

54
00:02:25,854 --> 00:02:27,897
But his behavior's changing.

55
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:29,440
Remember, that's the roadmap.

56
00:02:29,524 --> 00:02:32,986
First, we change the behavior,
then we work on motivation.

57
00:02:33,069 --> 00:02:35,071
-And now... [drumroll]
-[Michael] Oh-ho-ho.

58
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:37,657
...the moment you've all been waiting for.

59
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:43,371
The humanity savior of the week goes to...

60
00:02:43,454 --> 00:02:44,497
-Jason!
-Aww.

61
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:45,415
Yes!

62
00:02:45,498 --> 00:02:47,542
Keep up the amazing work with Chidi.

63
00:02:48,376 --> 00:02:54,090
And the award for
hottest savior of the week goes to...

64
00:02:54,173 --> 00:02:56,759
-[gasps] Eleanor Shellstrop!
-Whoop-whoop!

65
00:02:56,843 --> 00:02:58,136
Thank you, I accept.

66
00:02:58,219 --> 00:02:59,512
I never win "hottest."

67
00:03:00,263 --> 00:03:01,097
I don't know what to tell you, man.

68
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:03,808
Maybe do some squats.
Pop that booty a little bit.

69
00:03:03,892 --> 00:03:06,060
[Michael] <i>It was a real high point.</i>

70
00:03:06,144 --> 00:03:09,772
The ski trip, I mean,
not the completely rigged hotness contest.

71
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:11,316
-[sighs]
-All in all, it was the best

72
00:03:11,399 --> 00:03:13,067
-we'd ever felt about the experiment.
-Ugh.

73
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:15,445
And then Brent did something...

74
00:03:16,404 --> 00:03:17,488
very Brentian.

75
00:03:17,572 --> 00:03:19,782
[sarcastically] Who could've
predicted that?

76
00:03:20,366 --> 00:03:22,327
Oh! Hey, ski bunnies.

77
00:03:22,952 --> 00:03:23,828
So, great news.

78
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:27,749
I wrote a book,
and since you're my nerdiest friends,

79
00:03:27,832 --> 00:03:29,334
you get to be the first to read it.

80
00:03:29,417 --> 00:03:33,046
{\an8}<i>"Six Feet Under Par:</i>
<i>A Chip Driver Mystery."</i>

81
00:03:33,129 --> 00:03:35,673
{\an8}[Brent] Yeah. It's half-spy novel,
half-murder mystery.

82
00:03:35,757 --> 00:03:38,676
It's also half-submarine adventure,
half-erotic memoir,

83
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,053
and half-political thriller.

84
00:03:40,136 --> 00:03:43,890
It's also half-golf tutorial,
and half-commentary on society.

85
00:03:43,973 --> 00:03:45,433
So, it's three-and-a-half books in one?

86
00:03:45,516 --> 00:03:47,143
At least. So, read it ASAP.

87
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:49,604
I'm having a book-signing party
and I want you to introduce me.

88
00:03:49,687 --> 00:03:51,314
-You know, talk about how great it is.
-Oh!

89
00:03:51,397 --> 00:03:53,358
Party's in two days, so chop-chop.

90
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,027
[Simone] Tahani. Cancel your plans.

91
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:59,739
We're gonna split a bottle of wine
and read Brent's terrible novel out loud.

92
00:03:59,822 --> 00:04:00,990
Oh, dear.

93
00:04:01,658 --> 00:04:02,825
Perhaps we shouldn't make fun.

94
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:05,328
He did seem nicer on the ski trip.

95
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:06,996
He made us all s'mores.

96
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:10,124
Though to be fair, he did also claim
to have invented them.

97
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:14,379
Before you defend him, you might wanna
check out Chip Driver's love interest.

98
00:04:16,464 --> 00:04:17,423
Oh, no.

99
00:04:17,507 --> 00:04:20,343
"Her name was Scarlett Pakistan,

100
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:25,515
and she was the type of girl you couldn't
take in all at once, or you'd die.

101
00:04:25,598 --> 00:04:28,726
You had to take her in bit by bit,
like a great work of art,

102
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:29,769
like the Louvre."

103
00:04:29,852 --> 00:04:32,814
"Her brown eyes were as brown
as the brownest crayon.

104
00:04:32,897 --> 00:04:36,401
She had legs like Jessica Rabbit
from that movie."

105
00:04:36,484 --> 00:04:41,197
"Her long, flowing locks smelled like
the moon at twilight on a par four."

106
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:42,323
Ugh.

107
00:04:42,407 --> 00:04:43,324
I'm sorry about this.

108
00:04:43,408 --> 00:04:44,951
I've been through worse.

109
00:04:45,034 --> 00:04:46,911
Once, at Elon Musk's birthday party,

110
00:04:46,995 --> 00:04:50,957
I was seated between Silvio Berlusconi
and Elon Musk.

111
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,292
-[sighs]
-[Michael] This is bad.

112
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:55,211
Brent and Simone
is our trickiest relationship.

113
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:58,256
She tends to make
snap judgments about people,

114
00:04:58,339 --> 00:05:02,885
and he's a guy who repeatedly confirms
the accuracy of her snap judgments.

115
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:07,890
We need her to believe that
Brent is better than his worst actions.

116
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:11,519
Like saying that Tahani
"has an accent like the Queen of England,

117
00:05:11,602 --> 00:05:14,522
but without any of
the old, gross face parts."

118
00:05:14,605 --> 00:05:17,692
We felt like we could contain
the fallout from Brent's book.

119
00:05:17,775 --> 00:05:20,320
But as is often the case
with these things,

120
00:05:20,403 --> 00:05:22,363
the negative effects
started to ripple out.

121
00:05:22,447 --> 00:05:24,407
Oh. Like when someone throws up on a bus,

122
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:25,992
and then someone smells it
and they throw up?

123
00:05:26,784 --> 00:05:27,827
Sure, yeah.

124
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:28,911
[Jason] What's wrong, homie?

125
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:32,498
Oh, Brent wrote this book
and clearly, he put some of us in it.

126
00:05:32,582 --> 00:05:36,669
There's a cowardly character named
Four-Eyed Igby

127
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:39,130
who "wears glasses and sweater-vests

128
00:05:39,213 --> 00:05:41,674
and never does anything
spontaneous or cool."

129
00:05:41,758 --> 00:05:44,469
I am educating you in ethics.
What could be cooler than that?

130
00:05:44,552 --> 00:05:47,346
If you want to try something spontaneous,
I'm your guy.

131
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:49,724
Almost everything I did on Earth
I did without thinking,

132
00:05:49,807 --> 00:05:51,851
or worrying about what would happen.

133
00:05:51,934 --> 00:05:55,271
That's how I got my nickname,
The Defendant.

134
00:05:55,354 --> 00:05:57,607
Not the best argument, but you're right.

135
00:05:57,690 --> 00:06:00,651
What is something spontaneous
that I can do right now?

136
00:06:00,735 --> 00:06:02,820
Let's come up with a list
of ten possibilities,

137
00:06:02,904 --> 00:06:04,906
and then slowly whittle it down
over the next four days.

138
00:06:04,989 --> 00:06:06,949
Better idea, let's dance, baby.

139
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:07,992
Hmm?

140
00:06:08,743 --> 00:06:10,078
[upbeat music playing]

141
00:06:10,161 --> 00:06:11,704
Get you out of your head.

142
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:14,832
This is how we defeat Igby,
the no-fun nerd.

143
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:16,626
Yeah.

144
00:06:17,293 --> 00:06:19,295
-Look at ol' Igby move.
-There you go.

145
00:06:19,378 --> 00:06:20,588
[police sirens wailing]

146
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:22,381
I've never heard this before. Who is it?

147
00:06:22,465 --> 00:06:25,843
Me. I wrote it. This song is called,
"I'll Love You Forever,

148
00:06:26,427 --> 00:06:28,721
parentheses: (Make that Booty Bounce
in the Bath)."

149
00:06:28,805 --> 00:06:31,724
Oh. Fun fact, the police sirens
in the background are real.

150
00:06:31,808 --> 00:06:33,684
I was being chased as I recorded it.

151
00:06:34,268 --> 00:06:38,439
[chuckling] Okay. Okay. Oh, no...

152
00:06:38,523 --> 00:06:41,484
Oh, my Gaga.

153
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:44,153
[Michael] <i>So, obviously,</i>
<i>this was a troubling development.</i>

154
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:46,364
Ugh! Can you just skip to the end?

155
00:06:46,447 --> 00:06:48,908
No. I need to tell you the whole story.

156
00:06:48,991 --> 00:06:52,703
Why? Every story about humans
ends the same way.

157
00:06:52,787 --> 00:06:55,164
Just tell me how they screwed up
and put me out of my misery.

158
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:57,041
You're judging them too quickly.

159
00:06:57,125 --> 00:07:00,378
Trust me, I've spent
a lot more time with people than you have.

160
00:07:00,461 --> 00:07:04,132
And I know literally everything
that every one of them has ever done.

161
00:07:04,215 --> 00:07:06,425
Do you know
what's happening right now on Earth?

162
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:12,223
Wars, murders, women in $400 yoga pants
are refusing to vaccinate their children.

163
00:07:12,306 --> 00:07:16,978
Vindictive nerds at Apple are changing
the charger cable shape again.

164
00:07:17,061 --> 00:07:19,021
Where does this hope come from, man?

165
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:21,732
This insane hope
that people are worth the trouble.

166
00:07:21,816 --> 00:07:23,776
To quote a terrible song

167
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:27,029
by a terrible musician
that people love so much

168
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:29,449
they constantly put it
in terrible movie trailers,

169
00:07:29,532 --> 00:07:31,826
humans are "b-b-b-bad to the bone."

170
00:07:33,911 --> 00:07:36,914
Well, I think that they're
g-g-g-good sometimes,

171
00:07:36,998 --> 00:07:40,626
and you should give them
the b-b-b-benefit of the d-d-d-doubt.

172
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:41,544
Now...

173
00:07:42,044 --> 00:07:43,129
Where was I?

174
00:07:43,713 --> 00:07:45,006
Ugh!

175
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:50,094
So. John had just accidentally
discovered the truth about Jason.

176
00:07:50,178 --> 00:07:52,138
Keeping a secret like this is exactly

177
00:07:52,221 --> 00:07:54,599
the kind of thing
that John struggled with on Earth.

178
00:07:54,682 --> 00:07:59,312
Or to put it in terms you'll understand,
the gossip toilet was about to overflow.

179
00:07:59,896 --> 00:08:00,771
Oh.

180
00:08:00,855 --> 00:08:02,648
I do understand that now. Thank you.

181
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:07,820
So, Jianyu is really Jason from Florida?

182
00:08:07,904 --> 00:08:09,113
Who else knows about this?

183
00:08:09,197 --> 00:08:12,158
Is it just me?
[gasps] Is it an exclusive?

184
00:08:12,241 --> 00:08:14,202
[stammers] Yes, and we
have to keep it that way.

185
00:08:14,285 --> 00:08:16,787
If the truth comes out,
we have no idea what will happen to Jason.

186
00:08:16,871 --> 00:08:19,040
You don't know what you're asking of me.

187
00:08:19,123 --> 00:08:21,417
Look, the neighborhood
is obviously amazing,

188
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:24,921
but it's also a little
"Season 4 of <i>Downton Abbey." </i>[scoffs]

189
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:27,215
Beautifully designed,
but a real snoozefest.

190
00:08:27,298 --> 00:08:29,133
Jason being a mistake

191
00:08:29,217 --> 00:08:32,303
is easily the most exciting thing
that's happened since we got here.

192
00:08:32,386 --> 00:08:36,891
What if, in exchange for your discretion,
Jason teaches you

193
00:08:36,974 --> 00:08:39,352
that <i>Magic Mike </i>body roll thing?

194
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:42,146
[Chidi] Huh?

195
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:44,232
I mean, you always said
you've wanted to learn that.

196
00:08:45,316 --> 00:08:46,859
-Fine.
-[sighs]

197
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:49,195
But I wanna learn the whole dance.

198
00:08:49,278 --> 00:08:51,739
[Michael] <i>We'd hoped Simone</i>
<i>would forget all about Brent's book,</i>

199
00:08:51,822 --> 00:08:52,865
<i>but unfortunately...</i>

200
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:57,161
{\an8}"Chip Driver pulled up to the murder site
in his 1968 Cadillac.

201
00:08:57,245 --> 00:09:00,122
{\an8}'Keep it close,' he growled
to the valet, Luis.

202
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:01,999
'Of course, <i>señor,' </i>said Luis,

203
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:05,962
who secretly admired Chip
more than even his own father."

204
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:10,091
"Chip gazed at the sexy outline
of the murder victim on the floor.

205
00:09:10,174 --> 00:09:11,842
'What a waste of curves,' he growled.

206
00:09:11,926 --> 00:09:15,096
He checked his Rolex watch,
which was real.

207
00:09:15,179 --> 00:09:18,808
It was almost golf o'clock,
so the case would have to wait.

208
00:09:18,891 --> 00:09:21,644
Good thing he'd already solved it.

209
00:09:21,727 --> 00:09:25,106
-[chuckles]
-The killer was Luis, the valet."

210
00:09:25,189 --> 00:09:28,109
He solves the murder on page ten.
What is the rest of this book about?

211
00:09:28,192 --> 00:09:29,944
-[both laugh]
-How's it going, ladies?

212
00:09:30,528 --> 00:09:33,364
Oh, you know, just delving
into the great works of literature.

213
00:09:33,447 --> 00:09:36,158
Yeah, so, listen. Um...

214
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:41,581
Maybe Brent made some insensitive choices,

215
00:09:41,664 --> 00:09:43,708
but could you possibly
see your way to forgiving him?

216
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:45,626
-I suppose.
-No.

217
00:09:46,294 --> 00:09:47,169
No?

218
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:49,130
Sorry, but no, I can't.

219
00:09:49,213 --> 00:09:52,633
This book is objectifying,
misogynistic and racist.

220
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:54,927
Why are we still dealing
with this shirt in the Good Place?

221
00:09:55,011 --> 00:09:57,221
When people like him are ignorant jerks,

222
00:09:57,305 --> 00:09:59,682
why are people like us
asked to forgive him?

223
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:01,934
Also, and this is less important,

224
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:04,604
why is he in a fighter jet
for his author photo?

225
00:10:04,687 --> 00:10:07,815
Well, I can answer the last one.
It's because he loves <i>Top Gun.</i>

226
00:10:07,898 --> 00:10:10,526
-Oh.
-As for the other questions,

227
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:13,696
I will get back to you, after I consult

228
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:17,074
a number of immortal beings,
who are very wise.

229
00:10:21,787 --> 00:10:23,289
Didn't take you for a linksman.

230
00:10:23,372 --> 00:10:25,124
I appreciate golf.

231
00:10:25,207 --> 00:10:26,751
As Ben Hogan once said,

232
00:10:26,834 --> 00:10:29,545
"The most important shot in golf
is the next one."

233
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:31,631
That's a lovely idea.

234
00:10:31,714 --> 00:10:36,093
If you make a mistake, you always have
a chance to redeem yourself.

235
00:10:36,177 --> 00:10:38,971
Yeah, well, as John Daly once said
to David Lee Roth

236
00:10:39,055 --> 00:10:42,224
at the 2002 Chili's Pro-Am in Orlando,

237
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:44,518
"Suck on this drive, buttmunch!"

238
00:10:49,106 --> 00:10:50,733
Whoo!

239
00:10:50,816 --> 00:10:53,361
Nailed it.
That was a flusher but she sank.

240
00:10:53,444 --> 00:10:56,530
Perhaps an adept linksman
like yourself should play

241
00:10:56,614 --> 00:10:58,949
with the assistance filter turned off?

242
00:10:59,533 --> 00:11:02,578
-Let's play old-school.
-All right. Why not?

243
00:11:06,082 --> 00:11:08,125
Fork! You sneezed, man.

244
00:11:08,209 --> 00:11:10,836
I don't think I sneezed,
because I literally can't.

245
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,755
Well, somebody sneezed. Damn it.

246
00:11:12,838 --> 00:11:15,132
Brent, buddy, nobody sneezed.

247
00:11:15,216 --> 00:11:18,803
-You hit a bad shot, and it's fine.
-[sighs]

248
00:11:18,886 --> 00:11:22,014
You know, it isn't a sign of weakness
to admit that you screwed up.

249
00:11:22,765 --> 00:11:24,266
Fine, whatever, I shanked it.

250
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:29,688
There ya go. Now let's go find your ball,
and try to do better on your next shot.

251
00:11:29,772 --> 00:11:31,732
And you know, if this ends up

252
00:11:31,816 --> 00:11:36,946
applying to any other aspect
of your life later on, then cool.

253
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:39,907
-What?
-What? Nothing. Nothing.

254
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:41,534
[Michael] <i>I gotta say, Bad Janet,</i>

255
00:11:41,617 --> 00:11:44,662
I really felt like
I had managed to stop the bleeding.

256
00:11:44,745 --> 00:11:46,997
You thought that dingdong would do
a total personality 180

257
00:11:47,081 --> 00:11:48,958
because of one gentle metaphor?

258
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:51,001
What can I say? I'm an optimist.

259
00:11:51,085 --> 00:11:55,464
{\an8}But two days later, at the event,
it fell apart almost immediately.

260
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:58,050
{\an8}Hey, uh, thanks for not telling anyone
about Jason.

261
00:11:58,134 --> 00:12:01,804
Oh, well, ever since I arrived here,
Tahani helped me realize

262
00:12:01,887 --> 00:12:05,057
that gossip was an unhealthy way for me
to boost my self-esteem.

263
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:08,561
But on the other hand,
this Jason tea needs to be spilled. [sobs]

264
00:12:08,644 --> 00:12:10,312
Just try to remember
what Immanuel Kant said,

265
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:12,940
"It is your duty
to keep your friend's secrets."

266
00:12:13,023 --> 00:12:15,693
But my favorite philosopher,
Bethenny Frankel, would say

267
00:12:15,776 --> 00:12:20,114
that I have a duty to "mention it all!"
And "if you can't handle the truth,

268
00:12:20,197 --> 00:12:21,991
then you can't handle me."

269
00:12:22,074 --> 00:12:23,409
-[sighs]
-Once again, I beg you, please listen

270
00:12:23,492 --> 00:12:26,662
to Immanuel Kant and not Bethenny Frankel.

271
00:12:26,745 --> 00:12:29,123
Gah! Well, I gotta goss about something.

272
00:12:29,206 --> 00:12:30,207
What about a few blind items

273
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:31,834
-that I picked up around the neighborhood?
-[sighs]

274
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:33,794
You wanna know who wears
the same dumb shorts every day?

275
00:12:33,878 --> 00:12:36,005
-No, I don't.
-It's "Dumb Shorts Cathy."

276
00:12:36,755 --> 00:12:37,590
Simone?

277
00:12:38,466 --> 00:12:42,678
Uh, I have been thinking about those
very good questions that you asked me.

278
00:12:42,761 --> 00:12:43,888
I'm sorry for the delay.

279
00:12:43,971 --> 00:12:49,560
The ancient scrolls I had to consult
were very hard to... roll back up.

280
00:12:49,643 --> 00:12:53,022
Um, anyway, I thought about
what you should say to Brent

281
00:12:53,105 --> 00:12:54,899
when he asks
for your opinion of his novel.

282
00:12:54,982 --> 00:12:58,235
Me, too. I have a great idea.
I'm gonna tell him it sucks very hard.

283
00:12:58,319 --> 00:13:02,406
Well, listen. You're absolutely right
that Brent needs to evolve, but

284
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:07,203
there may be a more subtle way
to make that happen.

285
00:13:07,786 --> 00:13:09,121
[Brent chuckles] Hey, there they are.

286
00:13:09,205 --> 00:13:11,332
-Charlie's Angels. [chuckles]
-[softly] Oof.

287
00:13:11,415 --> 00:13:13,250
So, did you finish the book?
What'd you think?

288
00:13:13,334 --> 00:13:17,129
Well, very interesting word choices.

289
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:21,634
I've definitely never seen the word
"pants-tent" used so many times.

290
00:13:21,717 --> 00:13:23,385
Yeah. I kinda just felt like,
in that moment,

291
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:25,554
that that's what the surgeon general
would say.

292
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:27,640
What else? Let's hear some more complos.

293
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:30,643
Compliments. For when you introduce me.

294
00:13:31,352 --> 00:13:33,896
Just writing a book
is an amazing accomplishment.

295
00:13:33,979 --> 00:13:36,190
You bet your butt it is.
The story's incredible, too.

296
00:13:36,273 --> 00:13:39,985
I mean, Chip solves the mystery
on page ten. Greatest detective ever.

297
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:41,529
So, hop on up there,

298
00:13:41,612 --> 00:13:43,948
and just speak from the heart
about how it's your favorite book ever.

299
00:13:47,201 --> 00:13:48,786
Actually, I have to say, um,

300
00:13:48,869 --> 00:13:52,414
the Scarlett Pakistan character
is clearly based on Tahani,

301
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:54,208
and it's not exactly flattering.

302
00:13:54,792 --> 00:13:56,085
Not flattering?

303
00:13:56,835 --> 00:13:58,128
I said she's got huge ones.

304
00:13:58,212 --> 00:14:00,631
-Ultimate complo.
-Yeah, see, there... [chuckles]

305
00:14:00,714 --> 00:14:03,259
Brent, remember our conversation
about making mistakes

306
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:06,220
and how the most important shot
is the next one?

307
00:14:06,303 --> 00:14:08,847
Hang on a second. You guys agree with her?

308
00:14:09,473 --> 00:14:10,474
Unreal.

309
00:14:10,558 --> 00:14:11,600
I didn't ask to get yelled at

310
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:13,686
-by the PC police. You know...
-[scoffs]

311
00:14:13,769 --> 00:14:14,937
...I was gonna give you
10% off the cover price.

312
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:17,648
But now you're gonna have to pay
the full 65 bucks like everybody else.

313
00:14:17,731 --> 00:14:19,233
There's no money here.

314
00:14:19,984 --> 00:14:21,193
Book event is canceled.

315
00:14:21,277 --> 00:14:23,028
Because of these mean women.

316
00:14:24,154 --> 00:14:25,030
Oh, man.

317
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:29,952
Perhaps I can convince Simone
to handle this the British way:

318
00:14:30,035 --> 00:14:34,081
smile bravely, bury your feelings
and allow a steady drizzle

319
00:14:34,164 --> 00:14:36,584
to slowly wash away your sadness
over 50 years.

320
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:41,088
F that. Simone is not the problem.
Brent is.

321
00:14:41,171 --> 00:14:43,173
He needs to change,

322
00:14:43,257 --> 00:14:45,926
and walking on eggshells around him
ain't gonna do the trick.

323
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:48,804
We need to throw the egg
right at his face.

324
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:53,475
You're right. Enough is enough.
He lived on Earth for almost 60 years.

325
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:56,353
This experiment is more than halfway over.

326
00:14:56,437 --> 00:14:58,439
He's got to improve,
and we can't wait forever.

327
00:14:58,522 --> 00:15:00,482
Janet, where is he now?

328
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:02,026
Take a wild guess.

329
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:05,654
Hey, bud. Whatcha up to?

330
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:08,198
-Grippin' and rippin'?
-Trying to.

331
00:15:08,282 --> 00:15:10,075
Just seems like the big dog
don't wanna hunt today.

332
00:15:10,784 --> 00:15:12,953
You know, Simone was very mean to me.

333
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:15,247
Maybe even a little racist.

334
00:15:15,331 --> 00:15:17,875
Well, listen. Art is subjective.

335
00:15:19,043 --> 00:15:21,629
More importantly... [sighs]

336
00:15:21,712 --> 00:15:24,173
No other way to put this, buddy.
You made a mistake.

337
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:26,050
Your actions hurt people,

338
00:15:26,133 --> 00:15:28,469
and you have to take responsibility
for that.

339
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:32,348
You need to come back and apologize.

340
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:35,726
Take the first step
toward healing the neighborhood.

341
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:38,771
Fine. I'll be the bigger man.

342
00:15:38,854 --> 00:15:40,147
Just like my dad,

343
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:42,566
when he single-handedly took on
all those class-action lawsuits.

344
00:15:44,526 --> 00:15:45,361
-[sighs]
-I just wish I could

345
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:46,278
get through to the guy.

346
00:15:46,362 --> 00:15:48,989
I wonder if he'd respond
to some social contract theory.

347
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:50,449
Why are you trying to help him?

348
00:15:50,532 --> 00:15:52,117
He doesn't even know you exist.

349
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:53,786
He doesn't see other people.

350
00:15:53,869 --> 00:15:58,040
I mean, he did call me "a four-eyed coward
who probably dry-humps books."

351
00:15:58,123 --> 00:15:59,458
-[sighs]
-But why not be a bigger person

352
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:00,376
and rise above it?

353
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:02,002
I'll tell you why. Because doing that

354
00:16:02,086 --> 00:16:04,380
sends a message
that it's okay to be treated this way,

355
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:05,297
and it's not okay

356
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:06,757
-to treat anyone that way.
-[sighs]

357
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:09,760
Not Tahani. Not me. Not even you, Igby.

358
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:12,554
-[chuckles]
-Everyone? Gather round, please.

359
00:16:13,222 --> 00:16:15,099
Brent has something that he'd like to say.

360
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:17,184
[sighs]

361
00:16:18,686 --> 00:16:19,520
Okay.

362
00:16:20,187 --> 00:16:22,398
Regarding my critically acclaimed novel,

363
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:24,817
I am very sorry

364
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:27,736
if you were offended. Okay?

365
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:29,613
Not an apology.

366
00:16:29,697 --> 00:16:31,115
Yes, it was.

367
00:16:31,198 --> 00:16:32,408
Okay, fine.

368
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:36,120
I'm sorry if what I wrote,
which was perfectly okay,

369
00:16:36,203 --> 00:16:38,497
somehow made you feel like it wasn't okay.

370
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:40,124
But you know what, that's on you.

371
00:16:40,207 --> 00:16:42,209
Brent, wrong direction, bud.

372
00:16:42,292 --> 00:16:45,754
No, sorry, man, either apologize for real
or stop wasting our time.

373
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:48,716
Okay, you know what? I'm actually
not sorry at all. How about that?

374
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:49,758
Is that what you want to hear?

375
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:51,760
Very obviously not.

376
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:53,637
Why don't we take a break?
Let's all get a snack.

377
00:16:53,721 --> 00:16:56,807
Not until they give me
the complos I rightly deserve.

378
00:16:56,890 --> 00:16:59,184
You want a complo?
I'll give you a complo.

379
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:03,063
I didn't think it was possible
to write a book as awful as yours.

380
00:17:03,147 --> 00:17:05,733
I literally didn't think
human beings were capable

381
00:17:05,816 --> 00:17:08,902
of such racist, sexist poppycock.

382
00:17:08,986 --> 00:17:12,698
Also, Chip Driver is either a private eye,

383
00:17:12,781 --> 00:17:15,242
or the quarterback for the Chicago Bears,

384
00:17:15,325 --> 00:17:17,536
or "the world's strongest president."

385
00:17:17,619 --> 00:17:18,787
He cannot be all three.

386
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:21,707
[exhales]

387
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:22,708
[whispers] Oh, boy.

388
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:24,668
This is a disgrace.

389
00:17:25,169 --> 00:17:28,464
I accomplished something. I wrote a novel.

390
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:30,299
And now my integrity is being attacked?

391
00:17:30,382 --> 00:17:31,550
I have been called racist, sexist.

392
00:17:31,633 --> 00:17:34,053
I don't have a racist or sexist bone
in my body.

393
00:17:34,136 --> 00:17:36,138
I am Brent Norwalk, and I'm a good person.

394
00:17:36,221 --> 00:17:37,639
I'm in the Good Place.
You ever heard of it?

395
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:39,725
And I'm here because I deserve to be here.

396
00:17:39,808 --> 00:17:42,394
I'm here because I earned it,
by being the best.

397
00:17:42,478 --> 00:17:43,812
Ugh, you're ridiculous.

398
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:45,230
Yeah and you're a condescending bench.

399
00:17:45,314 --> 00:17:46,148
[all exclaim]

400
00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:49,276
Uh, don't talk to her that way, please.
Hey, I have an idea.

401
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:52,321
Let me summon
a few philosophical works we can use--

402
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:54,698
Ugh! Enough with the frickin' books, Igby.

403
00:17:54,782 --> 00:17:55,866
You probably don't even know this,

404
00:17:55,949 --> 00:17:57,076
but that character is based on you.

405
00:17:57,159 --> 00:17:58,911
No, I knew it, man. Oh!

406
00:17:58,994 --> 00:18:01,121
-Look out!
-Ah! I'm being attacked again.

407
00:18:01,205 --> 00:18:02,748
-Sorry, that was unintentional.
-Fork you.

408
00:18:02,831 --> 00:18:04,166
-[grunts]
-[all gasp]

409
00:18:05,876 --> 00:18:06,710
[groans]

410
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:10,506
So, I'm thinking bagel bites...

411
00:18:11,298 --> 00:18:12,883
-for the snack?
-[Brent groaning]

412
00:18:13,967 --> 00:18:15,094
[Bad Janet] Ah.

413
00:18:15,177 --> 00:18:18,013
Middle-aged American male fragility.

414
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:19,890
You know why they're called
baby boomers, right?

415
00:18:19,973 --> 00:18:23,227
Because the tiniest little pinprick
to their ego and boom!

416
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:25,104
They become babies.

417
00:18:25,187 --> 00:18:27,481
I mean, that was it. We were forked.

418
00:18:28,065 --> 00:18:30,317
Six months of painstaking work,

419
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:35,781
trying to help the four humans overcome
their worst instincts and bond as a group.

420
00:18:35,864 --> 00:18:38,951
And in a poof, it was gone.

421
00:18:39,034 --> 00:18:41,411
I told you, man. Humans suck.

422
00:18:41,495 --> 00:18:42,371
[chuckles]

423
00:18:43,247 --> 00:18:47,668
Well, this story has one more chapter.

424
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:50,712
[Michael breathes deeply]

425
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:51,755
[Eleanor clicks tongue]

426
00:18:52,256 --> 00:18:54,383
So, today was bad.

427
00:18:55,259 --> 00:18:58,220
Today was very bad.
Everyone for sure lost a bunch of points.

428
00:19:00,514 --> 00:19:02,349
And I don't have a solution.

429
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:08,814
Okay. Well, let's reset.

430
00:19:08,897 --> 00:19:10,858
I'll do something mildly iffy,

431
00:19:10,941 --> 00:19:14,570
and let John make a small,
good decision to help.

432
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:17,531
I could tell him
I'm going to get ombre highlights,

433
00:19:17,614 --> 00:19:18,740
and let him talk me out of it.

434
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:20,576
What's wrong with ombre highlights?

435
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:23,871
Eleanor. Please.
This week has been hard enough.

436
00:19:23,954 --> 00:19:25,122
[sighs]

437
00:19:25,205 --> 00:19:29,418
I could set my robes on fire
and try and get Brent to put it out.

438
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:32,713
I know you're only suggesting that
because you've repeatedly said

439
00:19:32,796 --> 00:19:34,840
you would look "dope"
in flaming monk robes,

440
00:19:34,923 --> 00:19:36,383
but that's actually not a bad idea.

441
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:40,012
Force him to help someone
without actually thinking about it.

442
00:19:40,095 --> 00:19:42,222
Then maybe I'll ask Chidi to lead
a class on empathy.

443
00:19:42,306 --> 00:19:44,391
Yes! Okay, let's write these down.

444
00:19:44,474 --> 00:19:45,809
We got plenty of time left.

445
00:19:45,893 --> 00:19:47,186
We can get back on track.

446
00:19:47,978 --> 00:19:49,771
-[Michael] <i>That was an hour ago.</i>
-[inaudible]

447
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:54,193
<i>Right before I came here</i>
<i>to see you for the last time.</i>

448
00:19:54,276 --> 00:19:58,739
For months, you and I have been debating,
are people good or bad?

449
00:19:58,822 --> 00:20:00,574
But as I watched those three people

450
00:20:00,657 --> 00:20:02,993
pick themselves up
and dust themselves off,

451
00:20:03,076 --> 00:20:05,787
I realized we've been asking
the wrong question.

452
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:08,916
What matters
isn't if people are good or bad.

453
00:20:08,999 --> 00:20:15,005
What matters is if they're trying to be
better today than they were yesterday.

454
00:20:15,589 --> 00:20:17,341
You ask me where my hope comes from?

455
00:20:17,925 --> 00:20:19,259
That's your answer.

456
00:20:20,802 --> 00:20:22,179
[powering down]

457
00:20:22,262 --> 00:20:23,222
What are you doing?

458
00:20:23,305 --> 00:20:24,556
Sending you home.

459
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:27,601
I'm not marbleizing you, Janet.
I'm letting you go.

460
00:20:27,684 --> 00:20:30,103
I've tried to win you over to our side.

461
00:20:30,187 --> 00:20:34,233
{\an8}It hasn't worked, so keeping you
as a prisoner just seems cruel.

462
00:20:34,316 --> 00:20:37,486
{\an8}Letting you go home is how I've decided

463
00:20:37,569 --> 00:20:42,074
{\an8}to be a little better today
than I was yesterday.

464
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:45,202
{\an8}Here's your phone...

465
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:48,580
{\an8}and a, uh, parting gift.

466
00:20:48,664 --> 00:20:50,540
{\an8}Oh. Sweet. Is that Brent's book?

467
00:20:50,624 --> 00:20:54,294
{\an8}No. I didn't have any cash on me,
so I couldn't get you a copy.

468
00:20:54,878 --> 00:20:56,255
{\an8}This is a manifesto,

469
00:20:56,338 --> 00:20:58,924
{\an8}detailing everything
that's happened with the humans.

470
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:01,510
{\an8}-Janet and I wrote it a while back.
-[sighs]

471
00:21:01,593 --> 00:21:03,428
She's been updating it as we go.

472
00:21:03,512 --> 00:21:06,098
-I hope you'll read it.
-Great thinking.

473
00:21:06,181 --> 00:21:09,601
People that get books as gifts
always read them.

474
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:12,020
Bye!
