1
00:00:04,629 --> 00:00:06,548
[people screaming]

2
00:00:12,345 --> 00:00:15,098
[all groaning]

3
00:00:15,223 --> 00:00:19,602
That was awesome!
I'm going again!

4
00:00:19,686 --> 00:00:20,687
No!

5
00:00:21,271 --> 00:00:24,315
I think I barfed in the nether-dimension
before we landed.

6
00:00:24,399 --> 00:00:26,651
Is my barf
just gonna float out there forever?

7
00:00:26,735 --> 00:00:28,903
Will someone fly through my barf
when they use the portal?

8
00:00:28,987 --> 00:00:30,321
Ugh, stop saying "barf."

9
00:00:30,405 --> 00:00:31,614
And where's Michael?

10
00:00:32,323 --> 00:00:33,700
He's not coming.

11
00:00:33,783 --> 00:00:35,744
He sacrificed himself to save me.

12
00:00:35,827 --> 00:00:38,413
The last thing I saw
was Shawn grabbing him.

13
00:00:38,496 --> 00:00:41,374
Was it a nice grab or a bad grab?

14
00:00:41,458 --> 00:00:42,542
A bad grab.

15
00:00:42,625 --> 00:00:45,712
Like a nice bad grab or a mean bad grab?

16
00:00:45,795 --> 00:00:48,548
No Michael and no Janet.

17
00:00:48,631 --> 00:00:50,717
Didn't get to say a proper goodbye.

18
00:00:51,342 --> 00:00:52,886
Not even a mere toodle-oo.

19
00:00:55,388 --> 00:00:59,267
We're on our own.
We have to handle this ourselves.

20
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:03,521
Michael said the portal would lead us
to the Judge,

21
00:01:03,605 --> 00:01:07,400
so... where's the Judge?

22
00:01:07,484 --> 00:01:09,360
All I see is a burrito.

23
00:01:09,986 --> 00:01:11,362
[Chidi] Do you think it's a test?

24
00:01:11,446 --> 00:01:14,199
Like, maybe one of us
is supposed to eat it,

25
00:01:14,282 --> 00:01:15,867
or we eat it together,

26
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:19,829
or maybe it's a test to see
how long we can go without eating it.

27
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:22,540
I'm not scared of any burrito.
I'll eat it.

28
00:01:24,167 --> 00:01:28,213
Unless the burrito is the Judge.

29
00:01:28,296 --> 00:01:31,216
Don't be so bloody ridiculous.
Judges aren't food.

30
00:01:31,299 --> 00:01:32,634
Judges are serious people,

31
00:01:32,717 --> 00:01:35,386
who wear long silk nightgowns
and big white powdered wigs.

32
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:37,555
Ah-ah! He could be right.

33
00:01:37,639 --> 00:01:38,723
-[Tahani] What?
-Really?

34
00:01:38,807 --> 00:01:39,849
I don't know.

35
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:42,018
I'm just saying
we've certainly seen weirder things

36
00:01:42,101 --> 00:01:45,313
than an all-knowing burrito.
We can't take any chances.

37
00:01:46,064 --> 00:01:49,734
Hello, Your Excellency.
My name is Eleanor Shellstrop.

38
00:01:49,818 --> 00:01:51,277
We doth seek thine judgment.

39
00:01:51,361 --> 00:01:54,864
We've traveled a long distance to see you,
O Great One.

40
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:58,201
-What are you guys looking at?
-[all screaming and exclaiming]

41
00:01:58,284 --> 00:02:01,037
Hi. I'm the Judge.
That's a burrito.

42
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:02,831
What's up, guys?

43
00:02:02,914 --> 00:02:04,791
[theme music playing]

44
00:02:10,046 --> 00:02:12,090
Yeah, I did not think I had a case today.

45
00:02:12,173 --> 00:02:13,675
The paperwork should have shown up by now.

46
00:02:13,758 --> 00:02:17,095
{\an8}Unless you guys just, like, came here.

47
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:19,848
Wait, did you guys just come here?

48
00:02:19,931 --> 00:02:20,932
[gasps]

49
00:02:21,015 --> 00:02:23,726
{\an8}Oh, my God.
You guys are bad.

50
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:25,395
Which one is the worst one of you?

51
00:02:25,478 --> 00:02:27,063
Is it you, Glasses?

52
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:28,231
Oh, I bet it's you.

53
00:02:28,314 --> 00:02:31,192
{\an8}Okay, yeah, we did just sort of "show up,"

54
00:02:31,276 --> 00:02:33,194
{\an8}but we had to.
We were escaping the Bad Place.

55
00:02:33,278 --> 00:02:34,404
{\an8}-Mmm-hmm.
-Which, now that I think about it,

56
00:02:34,487 --> 00:02:36,573
{\an8}there might be some demons following us.

57
00:02:36,656 --> 00:02:39,284
{\an8}Don't worry about that.
Any time anyone shows up in my chambers,

58
00:02:39,367 --> 00:02:41,786
{\an8}the portal is sealed
until I issue my ruling.

59
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:44,956
So you guys can relax.
Get comfortable.

60
00:02:45,748 --> 00:02:49,085
{\an8}[gasps] A classic St. Crispin's Day
garden party frock.

61
00:02:49,168 --> 00:02:51,754
{\an8}Wait, is it after 4:00 p.m.?
Not important.

62
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:53,631
Let's have a look at your files.

63
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:57,135
{\an8}Wait, you don't already know everything
about us? You're not omniscient?

64
00:02:57,218 --> 00:02:59,971
{\an8}Well, not in the way you mean.

65
00:03:00,054 --> 00:03:02,432
{\an8}I try to learn as little as I can
about the events of humankind,

66
00:03:02,515 --> 00:03:05,894
{\an8}so I can remain impartial,
'cause I'm a judge. Yadda, yadda, yadda.

67
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:08,646
{\an8}That being said, sometimes I get bored
and I cheat a little bit.

68
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:11,065
{\an8}I've been bingeing
Ken Burns' <i>Vietnam</i> recently.

69
00:03:11,149 --> 00:03:12,400
{\an8}It's okay.

70
00:03:12,483 --> 00:03:15,862
{\an8}I mean, I'm immortal,
but that thing is long.

71
00:03:15,945 --> 00:03:17,530
{\an8}You know what I'm saying? [chuckles]

72
00:03:17,614 --> 00:03:19,949
{\an8}Anyway, your petition is denied.
I can't hear your case.

73
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:21,117
Please exit to the rear.

74
00:03:22,285 --> 00:03:23,453
What?

75
00:03:23,536 --> 00:03:26,372
I just absorbed
the entirety of your existences,

76
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:31,252
and I just wanna say,
you guys are so cute.

77
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:33,087
And the thing is,
you didn't file any paperwork,

78
00:03:33,171 --> 00:03:35,131
and you have no advocate,
and the rules say I gotta...

79
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:36,424
[blows raspberry]

80
00:03:37,175 --> 00:03:38,009
send you back.

81
00:03:38,092 --> 00:03:41,262
Your Honor, please hear our case.

82
00:03:41,346 --> 00:03:44,515
You frankly wouldn't believe what
we've been through just to be here today.

83
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:47,936
I mean, I would, because I just learned
everything about you,

84
00:03:48,019 --> 00:03:50,271
but keep talking.

85
00:03:50,355 --> 00:03:53,107
I am, like, obsessed with your accent.

86
00:03:53,191 --> 00:03:55,109
We have made so much progress,

87
00:03:55,193 --> 00:03:58,196
and all we ask is an audience
with you to prove it.

88
00:03:58,279 --> 00:04:01,866
Is that not your very purpose?
To weigh in on matters such as ours?

89
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:04,869
To paraphrase
a song written by my godfather,

90
00:04:04,953 --> 00:04:10,124
"Hey, Judge, don't make it bad.
Take a sad group and make us better."

91
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,210
Say "aluminum."

92
00:04:12,293 --> 00:04:13,169
Aluminium.

93
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:14,629
"Alumin..." [laughs]

94
00:04:14,712 --> 00:04:17,590
I love that! And I love your passion.

95
00:04:17,674 --> 00:04:21,135
I mean, it takes a lot of guts
to just show up here unannounced.

96
00:04:21,219 --> 00:04:24,764
Plus, I haven't had a case in, like,
30 years and I'm super bored.

97
00:04:24,847 --> 00:04:28,226
So it's either this or start <i>Bloodline</i>
and, I don't know,

98
00:04:28,309 --> 00:04:33,523
I don't feel like I can see Kyle Chandler
as anyone else but Coach Taylor.

99
00:04:34,983 --> 00:04:36,192
So, the case?

100
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:37,443
Right!

101
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:40,321
Let's do it.

102
00:04:40,405 --> 00:04:42,699
[all sigh in relief]

103
00:04:43,324 --> 00:04:44,701
[Shawn] You had one job:

104
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:46,619
torture four bad people forever.

105
00:04:46,703 --> 00:04:48,329
Not only did you fail, you're a traitor.

106
00:04:48,413 --> 00:04:51,291
You really junked your jeans on this one,
you butterface.

107
00:04:51,374 --> 00:04:52,959
I did what I had to do.

108
00:04:53,042 --> 00:04:54,877
Oh, you had to junk your jeans?

109
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:58,464
How could you
betray your own kind like this?

110
00:04:58,548 --> 00:05:01,092
Who taught you
how to turn a human inside out

111
00:05:01,175 --> 00:05:03,678
by reaching down their throat
and grabbing their butt from the inside?

112
00:05:03,761 --> 00:05:04,679
You did.

113
00:05:04,762 --> 00:05:06,556
You got that right, sister.

114
00:05:07,181 --> 00:05:08,516
And this is how you repay me.

115
00:05:08,599 --> 00:05:12,520
Oh, spare me the sanctimonious lecture.
You never cared about me.

116
00:05:12,603 --> 00:05:15,898
In the words of one of my actual friends,
"You're basic."

117
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:21,195
It's a human insult. It's devastating.
You're devastated right now.

118
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:24,824
The point is, the four of them
are in front of the Judge.

119
00:05:24,907 --> 00:05:28,202
And the Good Janet has escaped too.
You'll never find her.

120
00:05:28,911 --> 00:05:31,039
Oh, you mean this Good Janet?

121
00:05:31,122 --> 00:05:33,333
I found her in, like, two seconds.

122
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:36,252
She was wandering the halls,
being polite to people,

123
00:05:36,335 --> 00:05:37,962
like a chump.

124
00:05:38,046 --> 00:05:39,672
So I marbleized her.

125
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:41,007
Keep her if you want.

126
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:42,842
Maybe shove it up your wiener
for safekeeping.

127
00:05:42,925 --> 00:05:44,844
I don't know. It's up to you.

128
00:05:44,927 --> 00:05:48,473
I'm going to give each of you a test
to see how much progress you've made,

129
00:05:48,556 --> 00:05:51,392
and if I deem you fit
to be in the Good Place, then...

130
00:05:51,476 --> 00:05:53,352
Zoop!

131
00:05:53,436 --> 00:05:57,940
Up you go! Well, actually, sort of,
that way. [exclaims]

132
00:05:58,024 --> 00:05:59,942
Great. Can we be tested together
as a group?

133
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:02,445
Yeah, we all need to be able
to cheat off Chidi.

134
00:06:03,696 --> 00:06:07,992
That's why your name is Chidi.
I get it now.

135
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:10,661
I'm sorry, cuties.
The tests have to be individual.

136
00:06:10,745 --> 00:06:12,914
Well, can we be graded as a group then?

137
00:06:12,997 --> 00:06:16,417
The only reason we've come this far
is because we've helped each other.

138
00:06:16,501 --> 00:06:19,629
And I don't think anything's gonna feel
like the Good Place if we're not together.

139
00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:22,465
So, if you all pass, you're in.

140
00:06:22,548 --> 00:06:27,053
And if even one of you fails,
you're all effed, right?

141
00:06:27,637 --> 00:06:31,390
Terrible idea. I mean, truly awful.

142
00:06:31,474 --> 00:06:35,269
You are very lucky that I cannot send you
to the Bad Idea Place,

143
00:06:35,353 --> 00:06:36,854
because that one is a stanker.

144
00:06:36,938 --> 00:06:39,107
But whatever blows your dress up.
Am I right? [clicks tongue]

145
00:06:42,151 --> 00:06:43,694
-Jason.
-Present!

146
00:06:43,778 --> 00:06:44,695
Good.

147
00:06:44,779 --> 00:06:48,032
In front of you is a video game system
loaded with <i>Madden</i> football.

148
00:06:48,116 --> 00:06:50,785
Are you kidding me?
I'm the best at <i>Madden.</i>

149
00:06:50,868 --> 00:06:52,703
I call Jaguars!

150
00:06:52,787 --> 00:06:54,664
As I was about to tell you,

151
00:06:54,747 --> 00:06:57,333
you can only play against the Jaguars...

152
00:06:57,416 --> 00:06:59,001
-No.
-...using their archrivals,

153
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:01,087
{\an8}-the Tennessee Titans.
-No!

154
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:02,421
If you play the game and you lose--

155
00:07:02,505 --> 00:07:05,466
Oh! I'm gonna win.
Say no more, scary judge lady.

156
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:08,594
Tell my friends
their souls are in good hands.

157
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:12,723
No! I fumbled the kickoff! Titans suck!

158
00:07:15,893 --> 00:07:18,521
Tahani. It's such a pretty name.

159
00:07:18,604 --> 00:07:20,356
My name is super boring.

160
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:23,234
Gen. Which is short for "hydrogen,"

161
00:07:23,317 --> 00:07:26,279
which was the only thing
that was in existence when I was born.

162
00:07:27,155 --> 00:07:31,159
Anyhoo, all you have to do
is go through there,

163
00:07:31,242 --> 00:07:35,413
walk down the hallway
and through the red door at the end.

164
00:07:35,496 --> 00:07:38,624
-That's it? That's my test?
-Yup.

165
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:41,752
Oh, also, everyone in every room
that you pass

166
00:07:41,836 --> 00:07:43,921
is going to be discussing
what they truly think about you.

167
00:07:45,256 --> 00:07:46,299
Okay, have fun!

168
00:07:55,349 --> 00:07:57,268
[gasps]

169
00:07:58,436 --> 00:07:59,937
Oh, I see.

170
00:08:00,771 --> 00:08:04,400
It's a test of my ability to not care
what people think of me.

171
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,321
[gasps] Oh, no!

172
00:08:08,404 --> 00:08:11,741
So, just to be clear,
you actually rebooted them over 800 times,

173
00:08:11,824 --> 00:08:14,911
and all of these reports of their torture
are completely fake?

174
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:16,996
Yes. But, frankly, this is on you.

175
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:21,667
A lot of those details I just took
directly from Stephen King novels

176
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:23,336
and episodes of <i>Pretty Little Liars.</i>

177
00:08:23,419 --> 00:08:25,171
Just tell me why. Why would you do this?

178
00:08:25,254 --> 00:08:26,547
It's not like I planned it!

179
00:08:26,631 --> 00:08:30,510
I was just trying to prove that humans
could be made to torture each other.

180
00:08:30,593 --> 00:08:33,971
Instead, they helped each other
and got better.

181
00:08:34,055 --> 00:08:35,598
They were bad people.

182
00:08:35,681 --> 00:08:37,808
This is not supposed to be possible.

183
00:08:37,892 --> 00:08:41,812
So, the only explanation is that somehow,
there was a mistake made,

184
00:08:41,896 --> 00:08:44,398
and these people belong in the Good Place.

185
00:08:44,482 --> 00:08:45,942
No, they don't, idiot.

186
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:48,110
-Shawn, this is not fair.
-[Shawn scoffs]

187
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:51,906
"Fair" is the stupidest word
humans ever invented.

188
00:08:51,989 --> 00:08:54,158
-Except for "staycation."
-Ew.

189
00:08:54,242 --> 00:08:56,744
Look, those four humans are good people,

190
00:08:56,827 --> 00:08:59,914
and they deserve a staycation
in the Good Place.

191
00:08:59,997 --> 00:09:02,291
And I bet
the Judge will feel the same way.

192
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:04,085
I doubt she even hears their case.

193
00:09:04,168 --> 00:09:07,255
But if she does, one of them
will screw it up. They always do.

194
00:09:07,338 --> 00:09:09,924
I'm sick
of smelling this guy's lumpy, white ass.

195
00:09:10,007 --> 00:09:11,384
Can we get rid of him already?

196
00:09:11,467 --> 00:09:13,719
Yeah, it's time. Follow me.

197
00:09:14,428 --> 00:09:16,347
Okay, Eleanor and Chidi.

198
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:18,266
Looks like you guys are up.

199
00:09:18,349 --> 00:09:20,518
-At the same time?
-[chuckles] Yup.

200
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:23,396
[exhales heavily]

201
00:09:27,108 --> 00:09:28,109
[sighs]

202
00:09:32,697 --> 00:09:34,323
[giggles]

203
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:35,449
Trippy, right?

204
00:09:35,533 --> 00:09:38,244
There is no test.
You guys are in!

205
00:09:38,327 --> 00:09:40,496
We're "in"? What does that mean?

206
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,790
You've made great strides
and you've made it to the Good Place.

207
00:09:42,873 --> 00:09:44,417
-[Eleanor gasps]
-Congrats.

208
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:47,461
Take these medallions, go right through
that portal and you're there in a jiff.

209
00:09:49,463 --> 00:09:51,549
-We made it. We made it.
-We made it. Holy crap!

210
00:09:51,632 --> 00:09:53,426
-[both laughing]
-[Chidi] Whoo!

211
00:09:53,509 --> 00:09:57,346
All those ethics lessons paid off.
Whoever said philosophy was stupid?

212
00:09:57,430 --> 00:10:00,224
You did! Many times.
As recently as this morning.

213
00:10:00,308 --> 00:10:01,142
Whoo!

214
00:10:01,225 --> 00:10:04,854
But you also worked really hard
and you deserve this.

215
00:10:04,937 --> 00:10:06,397
You really do.

216
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,608
Here's the thing, though.
It's just the two of you.

217
00:10:08,691 --> 00:10:10,901
Tahani and Jason didn't make it.

218
00:10:10,985 --> 00:10:12,445
I'm giving them tests right now

219
00:10:12,528 --> 00:10:14,864
to determine where they belong
within the Bad Place.

220
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:18,576
So, you might wanna reconsider
that judge-us-together thing,

221
00:10:18,659 --> 00:10:20,411
'cause if you stick to that,
you're all going down.

222
00:10:21,412 --> 00:10:24,707
I am so hungry.
Why am I so hungry?

223
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:28,586
Oh, I'm such an idiot.
I forgot to eat my burrito.

224
00:10:28,669 --> 00:10:31,839
And I was so hungry too. What a dork.

225
00:10:34,383 --> 00:10:37,303
Okay, obviously, this is the test, right?

226
00:10:37,386 --> 00:10:40,514
I bet the Judge gave Jason and Tahani
the same offer

227
00:10:40,598 --> 00:10:43,351
and whichever couple takes it
actually loses,

228
00:10:43,434 --> 00:10:44,560
and the other two get in for real.

229
00:10:45,269 --> 00:10:47,605
Oh, diabolical.

230
00:10:47,688 --> 00:10:49,649
Hey, Judge, we figured out what--

231
00:10:49,732 --> 00:10:53,235
Nope! Tahani and Jason
have not been given the same offer.

232
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:55,196
Here, take a look.

233
00:10:55,738 --> 00:10:57,657
Tahani's test is to walk down a hallway

234
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:00,493
and not get tempted
by her gossiping friends.

235
00:11:00,576 --> 00:11:01,994
Jason is playing video games.

236
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:04,372
Oh. Okay, cool.

237
00:11:05,373 --> 00:11:06,791
[stammering] Sorry, I feel weird

238
00:11:06,874 --> 00:11:09,710
saying this to an almighty Judge,
but you have hot sauce on your chin.

239
00:11:09,794 --> 00:11:11,087
Thank you.

240
00:11:12,129 --> 00:11:13,464
It's actually not hot sauce.

241
00:11:14,256 --> 00:11:17,134
It's envy, or the concept of envy.

242
00:11:17,218 --> 00:11:20,721
It's really good on Mexican food.
It gives it a little kick.

243
00:11:22,431 --> 00:11:23,599
Okay, so what do we do?

244
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:25,267
Mmm.

245
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:28,312
Oh, no. That was
your "moral quandary" grimace,

246
00:11:28,396 --> 00:11:31,482
which is different from your
"gas pain" grimace... [mimics groaning]

247
00:11:31,565 --> 00:11:32,691
and different from your

248
00:11:32,775 --> 00:11:35,861
"someone said 'from whence it came'
instead of 'whence it came'" grimace.

249
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:36,987
[imitates exasperation]

250
00:11:37,571 --> 00:11:38,989
So, spit it out, man!

251
00:11:39,073 --> 00:11:43,619
If this isn't a test,
then it's something way worse.

252
00:11:43,702 --> 00:11:45,162
-What?
-A choice!

253
00:11:46,414 --> 00:11:48,040
That we have to make.

254
00:11:48,124 --> 00:11:50,501
Yeah, you know, why can't one part

255
00:11:50,584 --> 00:11:52,920
of the calculation of our eternal fate
be easy?

256
00:11:53,003 --> 00:11:54,338
I don't know.

257
00:12:01,887 --> 00:12:07,059
Quevenzhané Wallis and Stephen Hawking,
in the same room, discussing me?

258
00:12:09,186 --> 00:12:10,646
Guess they must have made up.

259
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:16,026
Focus. There'll be Fergies aplenty
in the Good Place.

260
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:24,994
[sighs]

261
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:28,706
I don't know
where we went wrong with Tahani.

262
00:12:28,789 --> 00:12:32,460
I know. She is such a disappointment
compared to her sister.

263
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:34,378
Hello, Father.

264
00:12:35,212 --> 00:12:37,256
-Hello, Mother.
-Oh.

265
00:12:37,339 --> 00:12:38,507
Hello, Tahani.

266
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:40,384
We were just talking about

267
00:12:40,468 --> 00:12:43,179
how you're a huge disappointment
compared to your sister.

268
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:46,557
Have a seat.
We'd love to get your take.

269
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:48,726
[Judge] <i>How's it going in here?</i>

270
00:12:48,809 --> 00:12:50,436
I'm losing by three.

271
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:52,229
Meditating to calm myself down.

272
00:12:52,313 --> 00:12:54,440
I'd be winning by, like, a million

273
00:12:54,523 --> 00:12:57,818
if I could play as the Jags,
instead of against them.

274
00:12:57,902 --> 00:13:01,489
I hate scoring
against my own favorite team.

275
00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:07,495
But you already knew that

276
00:13:08,662 --> 00:13:10,372
because this is the test!

277
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:12,458
Yeah, that's not a revelation
or something.

278
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:14,960
I explained that very clearly.

279
00:13:15,586 --> 00:13:17,338
It's nice to see you, Tahani.

280
00:13:17,421 --> 00:13:21,717
Apparently, wherever you've been,
they've been keeping you well-fed.

281
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:27,306
You know, I've actually risked quite a lot
to be in this room right now,

282
00:13:27,389 --> 00:13:31,727
so if you could just not be cruel
for 30 seconds, that would be lovely.

283
00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:34,813
Apologies. It's been a while
since we've seen you.

284
00:13:34,897 --> 00:13:37,775
We have so much to tell you
about your sister.

285
00:13:37,858 --> 00:13:40,945
We've just heard the most wonderful news.

286
00:13:41,028 --> 00:13:44,448
Kamilah dedicated her last album to you.

287
00:13:45,366 --> 00:13:46,283
Really?

288
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:50,412
Well, she dedicated it to her fans
and you're one of her fans.

289
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:55,167
The whole point of this afterlife test

290
00:13:55,251 --> 00:13:59,421
is that everyone in these rooms
is supposed to be talking about me

291
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:05,302
and yet, even in this scenario,
you are still talking about Kamilah.

292
00:14:08,264 --> 00:14:09,932
Which is exactly the point.

293
00:14:11,809 --> 00:14:16,146
I was never going to be enough for you,
never going to earn your respect.

294
00:14:16,939 --> 00:14:21,110
You know, I have done things
that you would never have approved of.

295
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:25,114
I died dressed as someone
in the service industry.

296
00:14:25,197 --> 00:14:28,909
I shagged a Floridian.
I even ate a Cheeto.

297
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:30,452
-[gasps]
-That's right.

298
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:34,415
Chewing it was deafening
and it's the happiest I have ever been.

299
00:14:34,498 --> 00:14:35,875
Don't get upset, dear.

300
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:37,751
You barely fit in that dress

301
00:14:37,835 --> 00:14:41,130
and I'm afraid you're going to "Hulk out,"
as it were.

302
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:42,548
Okay.

303
00:14:44,008 --> 00:14:47,303
I'm sorry we didn't have
a better relationship

304
00:14:48,137 --> 00:14:50,431
and I wish you both the best.

305
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:03,027
[Shawn] <i>All right, idiot, any last words?</i>

306
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:05,905
Go ahead and retire me already.

307
00:15:05,988 --> 00:15:07,615
You're not getting retired, Michael.

308
00:15:07,698 --> 00:15:08,949
-I'm not?
-No.

309
00:15:09,033 --> 00:15:10,659
Retirement is a spectacle.

310
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:12,745
Everyone would see the flaming ladles
go down your throat.

311
00:15:12,828 --> 00:15:15,539
Everyone would hear your
eternal shrieks of agony, blah-blah-blah.

312
00:15:15,623 --> 00:15:16,832
Then they'd ask me what you did.

313
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:18,834
I don't need that scrutiny right now.

314
00:15:19,793 --> 00:15:21,795
So, I'm just going to throw you
in this unmarked room

315
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:22,922
for the rest of eternity.

316
00:15:23,005 --> 00:15:23,839
[Michael grunts]

317
00:15:24,715 --> 00:15:27,635
And, since it seems you love humans
so much, I'll torture you like one.

318
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:32,431
All you'll have for entertainment is that
giant stack of <i>New Yorker </i>magazines.

319
00:15:34,016 --> 00:15:37,686
Oh, come on. You and I both know
I'll never read those.

320
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:39,396
Of course you won't.

321
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:42,942
But they'll just keep coming.

322
00:15:44,401 --> 00:15:47,279
[both laugh diabolically]

323
00:15:47,363 --> 00:15:48,781
Goodbye, Michael.

324
00:15:48,864 --> 00:15:51,408
We will leave you
with one of Bad Janet's classic farts.

325
00:15:52,117 --> 00:15:55,120
The smell will linger
for ten million years.

326
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:58,082
All right, here comes the boom!

327
00:15:58,165 --> 00:16:02,461
Oh, wait. Actually,
before I absolutely let it rip,

328
00:16:02,544 --> 00:16:03,921
I just have one more thing I have to do.

329
00:16:04,004 --> 00:16:04,838
What?

330
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:10,511
It's me! Good Janet!

331
00:16:10,594 --> 00:16:12,179
Janet!

332
00:16:12,262 --> 00:16:13,847
I thought you were a marble.

333
00:16:13,931 --> 00:16:14,765
That was a trick!

334
00:16:14,848 --> 00:16:18,185
I realized if we wanted our friends
to have any chance of survival,

335
00:16:18,268 --> 00:16:21,230
I had to learn how to do
a lot of bad things really quickly.

336
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:22,523
So I did!

337
00:16:23,148 --> 00:16:25,317
Now I'm ready to go back
to being nice again.

338
00:16:25,401 --> 00:16:26,652
[grunts] What happened?

339
00:16:29,446 --> 00:16:30,864
Okay, now I'll be nice again.

340
00:16:33,909 --> 00:16:36,036
Could you please stop doing that?

341
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,287
It helps me think.

342
00:16:39,957 --> 00:16:41,500
We've been through every argument:

343
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:46,005
Contractualist, Kantian,
"What would Superman do?",

344
00:16:46,088 --> 00:16:49,591
"What would Rihanna do?"
Are we missing anything?

345
00:16:50,384 --> 00:16:53,846
Hit me, right now,
with your most obscure, boring-est,

346
00:16:53,929 --> 00:16:57,850
"old white dude with a long wizard beard"
mumbo jumbo.

347
00:16:57,933 --> 00:17:01,937
Okay, our friends
are going to the Bad Place

348
00:17:02,646 --> 00:17:07,234
and us choosing to go with them
won't lessen their suffering.

349
00:17:07,901 --> 00:17:13,449
So, morally, we're allowed to go.

350
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:15,701
But let's forget about
the ethics for a second.

351
00:17:16,785 --> 00:17:18,078
After everything that's happened,

352
00:17:18,162 --> 00:17:20,789
don't we deserve to be together?

353
00:17:22,374 --> 00:17:24,209
And happy, for once?

354
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:29,673
Judge?

355
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:31,592
Have you made your decision?

356
00:17:32,217 --> 00:17:33,135
Yeah.

357
00:17:34,011 --> 00:17:35,971
We're not going to the Good Place.

358
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:38,140
I mean, that was never actually an option,

359
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:40,184
but for the sake of your test,
we're not going.

360
00:17:40,851 --> 00:17:41,852
What do you mean?

361
00:17:41,935 --> 00:17:45,314
Well, I was 99% sure that going
was the wrong move,

362
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:48,484
but, since our whole relationship has been
me being sure of something

363
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:50,778
and Chidi explaining why I was wrong,

364
00:17:50,861 --> 00:17:53,113
I owed it to him to quadruple-check.

365
00:17:53,197 --> 00:17:57,201
The capper came
when I realized that ain't Chidi.

366
00:17:58,077 --> 00:18:01,163
The Chidi I know wouldn't argue
that he should be rewarded

367
00:18:01,246 --> 00:18:02,372
while his friends got punished

368
00:18:02,456 --> 00:18:06,085
and he would never
"forget about ethics for a second."

369
00:18:06,168 --> 00:18:08,962
I don't know who this joker is,
but it's not Chidi Anagonye.

370
00:18:09,046 --> 00:18:10,339
Wait, but what about the--

371
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:13,509
Well done, Eleanor.

372
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:15,969
You can take a seat
and wait for the others.

373
00:18:16,053 --> 00:18:16,970
Can I have that medallion back?

374
00:18:17,054 --> 00:18:19,223
'Cause it's actually
a coaster for my sodas.

375
00:18:19,306 --> 00:18:20,641
Mmm-hmm.

376
00:18:21,225 --> 00:18:23,352
Where is the real Chidi, though?
Is he okay?

377
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:25,229
He's still taking his test.

378
00:18:25,312 --> 00:18:27,356
[clock ticking]

379
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:29,733
Okay, this is ridiculous. Um...

380
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,903
I'm just gonna choose...

381
00:18:35,405 --> 00:18:36,657
Brown.

382
00:18:37,574 --> 00:18:39,535
Gray's the obvious choice,
which is probably why

383
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:40,661
I shouldn't choose it.

384
00:18:40,744 --> 00:18:42,704
Brown. Nope. Gray.

385
00:18:43,831 --> 00:18:45,707
Nope. Brown. Brown hat.

386
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:52,923
All right. Fun stuff?

387
00:18:53,006 --> 00:18:54,174
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

388
00:18:54,258 --> 00:18:55,467
-Yeah? Feeling good?
-Very.

389
00:18:55,551 --> 00:18:56,385
-Yeah, I think so, yes.
-Yes.

390
00:18:56,468 --> 00:18:59,721
Great. You're all going to the Bad Place.

391
00:19:03,016 --> 00:19:04,685
Okay. Um...

392
00:19:04,768 --> 00:19:08,397
If I was the one who failed,
could you at least tell me why I failed,

393
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,565
for my own edification?

394
00:19:09,648 --> 00:19:12,359
It took you 82 minutes to choose a hat.

395
00:19:12,442 --> 00:19:14,528
But did I at least choose the right one?

396
00:19:14,611 --> 00:19:16,572
There is no right one.
They're hats.

397
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:19,074
Come on, man! Ugh!

398
00:19:19,867 --> 00:19:23,495
Tahani, you skipped a lot of rooms
that I thought would entice you,

399
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:25,914
but you weren't supposed
to open any doors

400
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:28,125
and you couldn't resist
confronting your parents.

401
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:29,585
Sorry, everyone.

402
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:32,504
But now that I failed, can I go back in

403
00:19:32,588 --> 00:19:34,464
and talk to Winston Churchill
and Freddie Mercury?

404
00:19:34,548 --> 00:19:35,841
No.

405
00:19:35,924 --> 00:19:38,302
Jason, your test was about
impulse control

406
00:19:38,385 --> 00:19:40,387
and you showed great improvements.

407
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:44,641
But you never asked
if you could opt not to play.

408
00:19:45,225 --> 00:19:48,312
I mean, you basically told me,

409
00:19:48,395 --> 00:19:51,982
an all-knowing Judge,
to just shut up and go away.

410
00:19:52,566 --> 00:19:54,860
Do you realize how insane that is?

411
00:19:55,819 --> 00:19:59,198
Not as insane as picking off
the greatest quarterback of all time,

412
00:19:59,281 --> 00:20:02,159
Blake Bortles, to set up a
last-second game-winning field goal.

413
00:20:02,242 --> 00:20:04,077
[imitating Jason mockingly]

414
00:20:04,912 --> 00:20:08,081
Now, Eleanor's test was about
her selfishness,

415
00:20:08,165 --> 00:20:10,083
-and she actually--
-I failed.

416
00:20:11,126 --> 00:20:14,546
I shoved an old lady down the stairs
to get to the raw bar,

417
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:16,673
because I'm a shrimp fiend.

418
00:20:16,757 --> 00:20:19,009
So, we all failed.
Let's not dwell on it.

419
00:20:20,969 --> 00:20:23,013
All right. Shall we?

420
00:20:28,602 --> 00:20:31,146
Oh, I am gonna miss you guys.

421
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:34,191
I made a little video
of our time together.

422
00:20:34,274 --> 00:20:37,194
[music playing through video]

423
00:20:37,277 --> 00:20:38,195
Look, there we are.

424
00:20:38,278 --> 00:20:42,282
You know, I thought I'd have a
stomachache right now, but weirdly...

425
00:20:43,825 --> 00:20:44,660
I do.

426
00:20:44,743 --> 00:20:46,870
-There's my guy.
-What?

427
00:20:46,954 --> 00:20:49,414
Doesn't matter.
I'm gonna miss you, bud.

428
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:52,918
{\an8}Every time they pull my eyeballs out
through my mouth, I'll think of you.

429
00:20:53,001 --> 00:20:55,045
{\an8}[laughs]

430
00:20:55,128 --> 00:20:56,838
{\an8}I'm gonna frame that one.

431
00:20:56,922 --> 00:20:59,007
{\an8}We gave it our best shot, guys.

432
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:02,469
{\an8}I say we go through the portal,
get a good night's sleep,

433
00:21:02,552 --> 00:21:05,264
{\an8}come back fresh in the morning, try again.

434
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:07,224
{\an8}Oh, Jason,

435
00:21:07,307 --> 00:21:10,644
{\an8}I feel like you always understand
about 20% of what's happening.

436
00:21:11,311 --> 00:21:12,646
{\an8}-Thanks.
-Sure.

437
00:21:13,397 --> 00:21:15,482
{\an8}[sniffles] I mean, look at us.

438
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:18,151
{\an8}Good times.

439
00:21:18,235 --> 00:21:21,029
{\an8}All right, off to eternal damnation.

440
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:22,656
Do you hear something?

441
00:21:22,739 --> 00:21:23,991
[man yelling]

442
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:26,618
-Oh!
-[all gasp]

443
00:21:26,702 --> 00:21:29,204
Hey, guys! How you been?
