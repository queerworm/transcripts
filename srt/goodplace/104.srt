1
00:00:01,084 --> 00:00:04,629
Hang on, hang on...
You're not supposed to be here either?

2
00:00:04,879 --> 00:00:06,756
You're a mistake, just like me?

3
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:08,133
Yeah, and I'm freaking out, dog.

4
00:00:08,216 --> 00:00:11,094
There's so much thoughts in my brain,
it's like my head is filled with rocks.

5
00:00:11,678 --> 00:00:15,932
How have you managed to stay undiscovered?
Because I have had to dodge and weave

6
00:00:16,141 --> 00:00:19,644
and barely escape with my life,
and you don't seem...

7
00:00:20,603 --> 00:00:22,522
Like a super genius.

8
00:00:24,149 --> 00:00:26,609
Hello, Jianyu. I'm Michael.

9
00:00:26,901 --> 00:00:29,529
Before we start,
I know you were a Buddhist monk

10
00:00:29,612 --> 00:00:31,948
and kept a vow of silence.

11
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:34,576
Would you prefer to remain silent
here as well?

12
00:00:36,327 --> 00:00:38,872
You literally haven't said
a word since we got here?

13
00:00:38,955 --> 00:00:40,915
Yeah. When I say I'm meditating,

14
00:00:40,999 --> 00:00:43,626
I'm just trying to figure out
what the fork is happening.

15
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:46,588
I think we might be in an alien zoo
or on a prank show.

16
00:00:46,671 --> 00:00:48,423
No, Jianyu, we're dead.

17
00:00:48,506 --> 00:00:51,634
Oh, that's a dope prank. [exhales]
Got to give it up.

18
00:00:51,718 --> 00:00:56,139
Okay, I need to make sure
that this isn't some sort of weird trap.

19
00:00:57,223 --> 00:00:58,600
Is your real name Jianyu?

20
00:00:58,683 --> 00:01:00,435
No. It's Jason Mendoza.

21
00:01:00,518 --> 00:01:02,979
And by the way,
everyone here thinks I'm Taiwanese.

22
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:05,273
I'm Filipino. That's racist.

23
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:07,067
Heaven is so racist.

24
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:11,196
But Tahani said that you helped Michael
by putting your hand on his chest

25
00:01:11,279 --> 00:01:13,364
and doing some sort of healing magic.

26
00:01:13,448 --> 00:01:15,658
Yeah. A nurse did that
to calm me down once

27
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:17,786
when I crashed my Jet Ski into a manatee.

28
00:01:17,869 --> 00:01:20,163
You crashed your Jet Ski into a manatee?

29
00:01:20,246 --> 00:01:23,166
Yeah. I'm from Jacksonville, Florida.
It happens a lot.

30
00:01:24,125 --> 00:01:25,251
What did you do for a living?

31
00:01:25,335 --> 00:01:27,670
I was an amateur DJ specializing in EDM.

32
00:01:28,379 --> 00:01:29,839
Electronic dance music.

33
00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:31,925
I was also an amateur
hip-hop backup dancer,

34
00:01:32,008 --> 00:01:33,593
an amateur body spray inventor...

35
00:01:33,676 --> 00:01:35,220
Um, I did pranks on Vine.

36
00:01:35,303 --> 00:01:36,471
None of those are jobs.

37
00:01:36,554 --> 00:01:37,639
What did you do to make money?

38
00:01:37,722 --> 00:01:39,641
Oh, I sold fake drugs to college kids.

39
00:01:39,724 --> 00:01:42,435
Okay, good.

40
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:44,354
Okay, here's my biggest question,

41
00:01:44,437 --> 00:01:47,941
how did you know
that I didn't belong here?

42
00:01:48,024 --> 00:01:51,236
I figured it out the very first night,
at the party,

43
00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:54,364
using my powers of deduction.

44
00:01:54,906 --> 00:01:56,324
I heard you don't talk.

45
00:01:56,407 --> 00:01:58,743
Well, here's something
for you to not talk about.

46
00:01:58,868 --> 00:02:01,663
I don't belong here. [chuckles]

47
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:03,123
They made a mistake.

48
00:02:03,206 --> 00:02:04,624
Total phony.

49
00:02:04,707 --> 00:02:06,835
So... [shushing]

50
00:02:08,711 --> 00:02:10,171
Okay, later, man.

51
00:02:11,381 --> 00:02:14,342
Okay. I vaguely remember that.

52
00:02:15,593 --> 00:02:18,888
I believe you, Jason.
You're not supposed to be here.

53
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:20,932
Welcome to the bottom of the barrel.

54
00:02:29,357 --> 00:02:30,775
Hello, Tahani.

55
00:02:30,859 --> 00:02:32,277
Oh, hello, Michael.

56
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,362
{\an8}I was just picking out some fresh orchids

57
00:02:34,445 --> 00:02:35,738
{\an8}for my nightly orchid bath.

58
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:39,200
{\an8}So, Tahani, one of your fellow residents
is opening a new restaurant tonight.

59
00:02:39,784 --> 00:02:42,412
{\an8}This neighborhood could use
a real morale boost.

60
00:02:42,912 --> 00:02:44,706
{\an8}And since you're an expert
at event planning,

61
00:02:44,789 --> 00:02:47,167
{\an8}I was hoping that you would help
with the grand opening.

62
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:49,043
{\an8}Oh, Michael, say no more.

63
00:02:49,127 --> 00:02:51,254
{\an8}I wasn't going to. I was done.

64
00:02:51,337 --> 00:02:54,382
{\an8}Well, good, because, of course,
I will. Janet?

65
00:02:54,465 --> 00:02:56,342
{\an8}-Hey, there.
-Oh, hello, darling.

66
00:02:56,426 --> 00:03:00,138
{\an8}I would like to model tonight's event
on my most successful gala.

67
00:03:00,221 --> 00:03:05,518
{\an8}That would be 2006 fundraiser for stem
cell research in Barcelona.

68
00:03:05,602 --> 00:03:07,437
{\an8}"Barcelona," actually.

69
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,188
{\an8}Oh, it was a perfect evening.

70
00:03:09,272 --> 00:03:11,566
{\an8}Princess Stephanie was there,
as were Posh and Becks.

71
00:03:11,649 --> 00:03:13,484
You know,<i> International</i>
<i>Sophisticate Magazine</i>

72
00:03:13,568 --> 00:03:15,528
gave us five Gwyneths.

73
00:03:15,612 --> 00:03:16,487
[laughs]

74
00:03:16,571 --> 00:03:19,616
{\an8}Tonight, I'm going to select
my jauntiest suit,

75
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:22,410
and I may even wear suspenders.

76
00:03:22,994 --> 00:03:26,164
It's one of the human clothing
items I'm most eager to try.

77
00:03:26,247 --> 00:03:27,916
Oh, well, good luck.

78
00:03:27,999 --> 00:03:30,460
{\an8}Thank you. Yes, yes. I'm excited.

79
00:03:30,543 --> 00:03:31,920
{\an8}And a little nervous.

80
00:03:32,003 --> 00:03:34,255
{\an8}I'd say that I'm cautiously optimistic.

81
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:37,592
{\an8}[laughs] I hope I don't chicken
out at the last second.

82
00:03:37,675 --> 00:03:40,094
{\an8}Sorry... We are talking
about suspenders, right?

83
00:03:40,178 --> 00:03:41,888
Like... These?

84
00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:45,266
You can do that with... Oh! I cannot wait.

85
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:46,809
Excellent.

86
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:49,062
[Eleanor] So, Tahani has no idea about me?

87
00:03:49,145 --> 00:03:52,565
{\an8}No. She thinks I'm a monk,
and she thinks you're her best friend.

88
00:03:52,649 --> 00:03:55,693
{\an8}Great. I mean, for us. It's a huge
bummer for her.

89
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:58,738
We need someplace
that we can talk in private.

90
00:03:58,821 --> 00:04:00,114
I agree.

91
00:04:00,782 --> 00:04:02,533
Let me show you my bud-hole.

92
00:04:02,617 --> 00:04:03,701
What?

93
00:04:03,785 --> 00:04:05,703
I should warn you, it's a little messy.

94
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:10,667
This is my bud-hole.

95
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:13,920
It's just, like, a hole
where me and my buds can hang out.

96
00:04:14,003 --> 00:04:17,674
Oh, bud-hole! Okay, now I get it.

97
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:21,094
I wrote down on a piece of paper that
I needed a private meditation area.

98
00:04:21,177 --> 00:04:22,303
Tahani will never come in.

99
00:04:23,429 --> 00:04:26,391
Pretty unique decorating style
you have here, Jianyu.

100
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:30,395
It's like, "12-year-old boy"
meets "13-year-old boy."

101
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:32,522
Thanks. Janet helped me
get all this stuff.

102
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:33,856
She rules.

103
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:37,110
Is she single,
or is she married to Michael?

104
00:04:37,193 --> 00:04:39,320
No, no, dude, you cannot date Janet.

105
00:04:39,404 --> 00:04:42,490
A, she's not human.
And B, you have to keep

106
00:04:42,573 --> 00:04:44,117
pretending to be Tahani's soul-mate.

107
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:47,120
Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Cool.

108
00:04:47,203 --> 00:04:49,664
Okay, just sit tight, dude.
I have a class to get to.

109
00:04:49,747 --> 00:04:51,124
What... A class?

110
00:04:51,249 --> 00:04:52,625
I didn't know there were classes.

111
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:55,461
Chidi is trying to teach me
to be a good person.

112
00:04:55,545 --> 00:04:56,963
And it's really hard.

113
00:04:57,046 --> 00:04:59,841
Also, Michael has asked me
to be his assistant, whatever that means.

114
00:04:59,924 --> 00:05:03,052
My whole situation here
is getting more and more dicey,

115
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:05,805
so I'm actually really glad
to have a place I can come

116
00:05:05,888 --> 00:05:07,682
when I just want to be myself.

117
00:05:07,765 --> 00:05:09,851
Yeah. I miss being myself.

118
00:05:10,435 --> 00:05:11,936
Myself was the best.

119
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:14,814
[upbeat music playing]

120
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,616
What's up, man? You're Jason?

121
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:28,870
You got two minutes.
Fred Durst is throwing an orgy

122
00:05:28,953 --> 00:05:30,455
on a partially capsized yacht.

123
00:05:30,538 --> 00:05:32,915
My dad just texted. It already started.

124
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:35,793
So I'll get right to the point.
I listened to your demo.

125
00:05:35,877 --> 00:05:37,253
You're terrible.

126
00:05:38,212 --> 00:05:39,255
-Really?
-Yeah.

127
00:05:39,338 --> 00:05:42,175
Okay? You just don't have any...
What's the word?

128
00:05:42,258 --> 00:05:43,259
Talent.

129
00:05:43,342 --> 00:05:44,594
But don't worry.

130
00:05:44,677 --> 00:05:48,264
You got something better than talent, man.
You got my approximate size and weight.

131
00:05:48,347 --> 00:05:50,725
I'm supposed to play this club
for the rest of the week,

132
00:05:50,808 --> 00:05:53,686
but I just got an offer
to DJ Scott Disick's after party

133
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:55,354
for the Amateur Porn Awards in Reno.

134
00:05:55,438 --> 00:05:58,024
Whoa, congrats, bro. That's the dream.

135
00:05:58,107 --> 00:05:59,692
It's your dream, man. It's my Tuesday.

136
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:01,235
I just need somebody to fill in.

137
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:03,780
Put on the helmet.
Press spacebar on the computer.

138
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:05,531
Those idiots won't know the difference.

139
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:08,993
For the next week, Jason, you are Acidcat.

140
00:06:10,495 --> 00:06:13,164
Whoa. There's a lot of old gum in here.

141
00:06:14,624 --> 00:06:16,501
Tahani, how are things going
in the front of the house?

142
00:06:16,584 --> 00:06:18,044
Because, to be perfectly frank,

143
00:06:18,127 --> 00:06:20,421
things in the kitchen are
going great, okay?

144
00:06:20,505 --> 00:06:21,923
I am right on schedule.

145
00:06:22,006 --> 00:06:25,760
Chef Patricia, I have triple-checked
every single detail.

146
00:06:25,843 --> 00:06:29,305
Your restaurant opening is going to be
the talk of the entire neighborhood.

147
00:06:29,388 --> 00:06:31,557
Thank you for your thoughtfulness
and hard work.

148
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:33,518
I could not have done this without you.

149
00:06:33,601 --> 00:06:34,852
[Michael] Ah, hello, Tahani.

150
00:06:36,771 --> 00:06:38,064
Sorry. I should've warned you.

151
00:06:38,606 --> 00:06:42,777
Patricia is actually very happy,
but she's also very intense.

152
00:06:43,277 --> 00:06:44,278
It can be confusing.

153
00:06:44,362 --> 00:06:46,155
No, no, no,
that's not what's bothering me.

154
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:47,323
It's just that, well,

155
00:06:47,865 --> 00:06:51,160
I looked at the guest list earlier,
and Jianyu isn't invited.

156
00:06:51,786 --> 00:06:52,829
Right.

157
00:06:53,538 --> 00:06:58,126
Jianyu is a beautiful spirit,
but he literally doesn't talk,

158
00:06:58,209 --> 00:07:00,920
and since this will be an evening
of lively conversation,

159
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:02,755
and you'll be busy working,

160
00:07:03,172 --> 00:07:04,924
I didn't want him to feel uncomfortable.

161
00:07:05,007 --> 00:07:06,968
I totally understand.

162
00:07:07,552 --> 00:07:08,928
Well reasoned, Michael.

163
00:07:09,011 --> 00:07:13,391
As us Brits are fond of saying,
"Try your best to hide your sadness."

164
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:18,896
So, the concept of the self
is a key subject

165
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:21,065
for a lot of great thinkers.

166
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:23,151
In the <i>Tao Te Ching,</i> Lao Tzu wrote,

167
00:07:23,776 --> 00:07:27,238
"Knowing others is wisdom,

168
00:07:27,321 --> 00:07:29,824
but knowing the self is enlightenment."

169
00:07:30,408 --> 00:07:32,452
Ah... "Knowing" yourself.

170
00:07:33,369 --> 00:07:35,705
Is he talking about
what I think he's talking about?

171
00:07:35,788 --> 00:07:39,333
No, Eleanor. Once again,
none of these philosophers

172
00:07:39,417 --> 00:07:41,377
is ever talking about masturbation.

173
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:44,755
Let's move on to this week's main event,

174
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:48,050
David Hume's<i> A Treatise of Human Nature.</i>

175
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:49,135
You read this, right?

176
00:07:49,218 --> 00:07:53,014
I did. Well, I tried to.
Well, I tried to want to.

177
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:56,017
Mm, actually, could we
postpone this lesson?

178
00:07:56,100 --> 00:08:00,480
I've befriended Jianyu from next door,
and I thought I could learn from him.

179
00:08:00,563 --> 00:08:03,900
That's a great idea. Hume's
"bundle theory" of the self

180
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:06,194
is fairly close to Buddhism.

181
00:08:06,277 --> 00:08:08,946
Yeah. No durr. That's why I'm doing it.

182
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:10,948
[music playing outdoors]

183
00:08:11,032 --> 00:08:12,408
Do you hear music?

184
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:14,744
That's not music.

185
00:08:16,621 --> 00:08:18,247
That's EDM.

186
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:23,085
What are you doing?

187
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:24,879
Eleanor, you were right.

188
00:08:24,962 --> 00:08:27,381
No more pretending.
It's time for me to be myself.

189
00:08:27,465 --> 00:08:28,841
What's up, homie?

190
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:30,593
Eleanor?

191
00:08:30,676 --> 00:08:31,886
You broke Jianyu.

192
00:08:35,139 --> 00:08:36,057
[sighs]

193
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:39,977
Okay, did we miss anything?
Oh! Take that jersey off, you goofball.

194
00:08:41,062 --> 00:08:43,189
Okay. This is not my fault. I swear.

195
00:08:43,272 --> 00:08:46,734
Eleanor, one hour ago,
that man was a silent Buddhist monk.

196
00:08:46,817 --> 00:08:49,403
Right. But here's the thing,
Jianyu is actually...

197
00:08:50,404 --> 00:08:52,365
A guy who is nice.

198
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:53,866
Hi, Tahani.

199
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:56,202
Eleanor, Chidi, What a lovely surprise.

200
00:08:56,285 --> 00:08:58,037
Don't mind me. I'm just dropping off
my afternoon gloves,

201
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:00,373
and picking up my early evening gloves.

202
00:09:00,456 --> 00:09:02,291
-How are you, soul-mate?
-I'm cool.

203
00:09:05,586 --> 00:09:06,754
I'm sorry.

204
00:09:06,837 --> 00:09:09,465
Am I going mad,
or did I just hear you say,

205
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:10,633
"I'm cool"?

206
00:09:10,716 --> 00:09:12,218
Mm. Mm-hmm.

207
00:09:12,301 --> 00:09:14,053
I don't think so.
I don't think that happened.

208
00:09:14,136 --> 00:09:15,221
No, you're wrong.

209
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:17,598
I see what's going on here.

210
00:09:18,266 --> 00:09:20,560
You've got a whisper in your snicker box.

211
00:09:20,935 --> 00:09:22,728
You're both helping Jianyu

212
00:09:23,312 --> 00:09:24,772
to regain his confidence

213
00:09:24,855 --> 00:09:28,693
to be able to speak again
as a surprise for me!

214
00:09:28,776 --> 00:09:30,653
Oh, busted.

215
00:09:30,736 --> 00:09:33,489
[laughing] My heart is soaring.

216
00:09:35,074 --> 00:09:36,450
[Michael] So, Jianyu is talking?

217
00:09:36,534 --> 00:09:37,868
-Oh, how wonderful!
-[laughs]

218
00:09:37,952 --> 00:09:40,871
I will do everything in my power
to encourage him.

219
00:09:40,955 --> 00:09:43,040
Well, not everything.
I won't give him a second mouth.

220
00:09:43,124 --> 00:09:46,127
Unless that would be helpful. No.
Better not risk it.

221
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:47,628
I've actually had a better idea.

222
00:09:47,712 --> 00:09:48,629
Oh.

223
00:09:48,713 --> 00:09:50,548
Let's add Jianyu to the guest list.

224
00:09:50,631 --> 00:09:52,133
Chidi and Eleanor have been
working with him,

225
00:09:52,216 --> 00:09:54,844
-and they're going to be here.
-What a great idea. Patricia!

226
00:09:54,927 --> 00:09:56,554
We can fit another chair, right?

227
00:09:56,637 --> 00:09:59,974
Change the floor plan
an hour before opening?

228
00:10:01,183 --> 00:10:03,019
Of course! The more the merrier!

229
00:10:03,811 --> 00:10:05,021
Oh, hurrah! [laughs]

230
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:09,317
I knew tonight was going to be perfect,
but now it's going to be even perfect-er.

231
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:12,987
Obviously, it's impossible for something
to be more perfect than perfect...

232
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:15,197
Well, it isn't, actually.

233
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:17,825
Any place or thing in the universe

234
00:10:17,908 --> 00:10:21,370
can be up to 104% perfect.

235
00:10:21,912 --> 00:10:23,372
That's how you got Beyonce.

236
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:24,457
Oh. [chuckles]

237
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:27,293
Oh...

238
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:29,462
Bud-hole.

239
00:10:29,962 --> 00:10:31,839
Okay... Now, tell me everything.

240
00:10:31,922 --> 00:10:33,883
[Eleanor] Okay, Jianyu...

241
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:36,844
Is a fraud, just like me.

242
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:38,054
His real name is Jason.

243
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:40,556
He's a drug-dealing DJ from Florida.

244
00:10:41,891 --> 00:10:42,767
It's gonna be fine.

245
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:44,018
We just need a plan.

246
00:10:44,101 --> 00:10:45,603
Oh, I got a plan.

247
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:47,897
We hack into Michael's phone,

248
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:50,149
download all his nudes,

249
00:10:50,232 --> 00:10:51,359
and then blackmail him.

250
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:53,611
No. What are you... No.

251
00:10:53,694 --> 00:10:55,154
Yo, you should listen to me.

252
00:10:55,237 --> 00:10:56,906
I came up with hundreds of plans
in my life,

253
00:10:56,989 --> 00:10:58,199
and only one of them got me killed.

254
00:10:58,282 --> 00:10:59,909
[Eleanor] Dude, be quiet.

255
00:10:59,992 --> 00:11:02,912
You are not Jason.
You are a monk named Jianyu.

256
00:11:02,995 --> 00:11:04,163
Got it?

257
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:08,876
-[upbeat music playing]
-[crowd cheering]

258
00:11:13,005 --> 00:11:14,715
[exclaiming]

259
00:11:15,383 --> 00:11:18,427
Oh, another great set, Jason.
They love you, dude.

260
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:21,722
They don't love me, man.
They love Acidcat.

261
00:11:22,223 --> 00:11:23,391
These cheers are fake.

262
00:11:23,974 --> 00:11:27,061
They hit my ears
like boxing gloves of sadness.

263
00:11:27,144 --> 00:11:30,231
Oh, that's some poetic thoughts, B.

264
00:11:30,314 --> 00:11:31,690
I got to be myself.

265
00:11:37,154 --> 00:11:41,158
Attention, Jacksonville. I'm not Acidcat.

266
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:44,328
I'm Mr. Music, the DJ.

267
00:11:44,412 --> 00:11:48,374
And this is a Mr. Music, the DJ original.

268
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:51,252
[music playing]

269
00:11:56,966 --> 00:11:58,300
[crowd booing]

270
00:11:59,677 --> 00:12:01,095
[Jianyu groaning]

271
00:12:04,014 --> 00:12:05,307
[glass clanking]

272
00:12:06,642 --> 00:12:09,395
Welcome to the opening of The Good Plates.

273
00:12:10,646 --> 00:12:11,981
[laughs]

274
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,482
I just got that.

275
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:15,609
-[crowd laughs]
-That's hilarious!

276
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:19,905
Anyway, at some point or another,
every resident in this neighborhood

277
00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:23,534
will fulfill his or her soul's
true purpose.

278
00:12:23,617 --> 00:12:26,412
Chef Patricia has done that tonight

279
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:27,913
by opening this restaurant.

280
00:12:28,831 --> 00:12:30,249
[crowd applauding]

281
00:12:30,624 --> 00:12:33,752
Now if you'd all like to take
a look at tonight's menus...

282
00:12:36,046 --> 00:12:40,134
That's right. With Michael's help,
Chef Patricia has recreated

283
00:12:40,217 --> 00:12:42,761
each person's favorite meal on Earth.

284
00:12:42,845 --> 00:12:44,054
Fun!

285
00:12:44,138 --> 00:12:45,139
[crowd applauding]

286
00:12:45,723 --> 00:12:46,932
[overlapping gasps]

287
00:12:47,475 --> 00:12:49,643
[indistinct chatter]

288
00:12:52,146 --> 00:12:53,689
It's my Grandmother's maafe.

289
00:12:54,482 --> 00:12:57,026
Fresh perch, slow-roasted
in a peanut sauce.

290
00:12:57,109 --> 00:13:00,779
Almost makes me forget
how miserable I am right now.

291
00:13:00,863 --> 00:13:02,364
You want to try a bite?

292
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:04,700
Fish and peanut butter?
No, I'm good. Thanks.

293
00:13:06,494 --> 00:13:08,287
Tofu? Oh, man.

294
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:09,788
Imma order some jalapeno poppers.

295
00:13:09,872 --> 00:13:11,999
[shushes] Be quiet
and eat your white sponge.

296
00:13:16,128 --> 00:13:17,463
-Janet?
-Hi, there.

297
00:13:17,546 --> 00:13:19,006
Hi. I didn't get a meal.

298
00:13:19,089 --> 00:13:22,259
According to our files,
your favorite meal was

299
00:13:22,343 --> 00:13:26,305
the hunger strike you went on
to protest Bolivian sex trafficking.

300
00:13:26,388 --> 00:13:28,724
Oh, right. Of course I did that.

301
00:13:29,767 --> 00:13:32,645
Tahani, great party. Check it out.

302
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:34,438
-Oh! [laughs]
-Suspenders! [laughs]

303
00:13:35,064 --> 00:13:36,190
So dumb.

304
00:13:36,273 --> 00:13:37,983
So much dumber than belts. [laughs]

305
00:13:38,901 --> 00:13:41,320
Oh, congratulations, Michael.

306
00:13:41,403 --> 00:13:43,531
How's Jianyu doing? Is he opening up?

307
00:13:43,614 --> 00:13:45,324
Mm, not yet.

308
00:13:45,407 --> 00:13:46,992
But I can tell he wants to.

309
00:13:47,535 --> 00:13:48,911
Don't worry. I've got a plan.

310
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:51,038
May I have your attention, please?

311
00:13:51,872 --> 00:13:56,085
Later this evening, we will be enjoying
Chef Patricia's delicious dessert,

312
00:13:56,168 --> 00:14:00,798
a stunning three-tiered cake
that took her a full week to complete.

313
00:14:00,881 --> 00:14:02,925
But first, I'd like to try something fun.

314
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:07,638
Each one of you has a very special memory
attached to the meal you're eating.

315
00:14:08,222 --> 00:14:11,350
Why don't we go around the room
and share our stories?

316
00:14:11,433 --> 00:14:12,643
Who'd like to begin?

317
00:14:14,103 --> 00:14:16,355
[chuckles] I'll start, Michael.

318
00:14:16,438 --> 00:14:17,523
[clears throat]

319
00:14:17,606 --> 00:14:19,733
One day, I wasn't feeling so great,

320
00:14:19,817 --> 00:14:23,821
so I made myself
a bowl of this chicken soup...

321
00:14:23,904 --> 00:14:27,241
When it gets to you,
say something short and boring about tofu.

322
00:14:27,324 --> 00:14:31,996
No. I'm sick of pretending
to be Jianyu, the tofu man.

323
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:34,164
I'm gonna tell the story
about my real favorite meal.

324
00:14:34,248 --> 00:14:36,041
-Which is?
-The Buffalo wings

325
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:38,419
at Stupid Nick's Wing Dump in Gainesville.

326
00:14:39,003 --> 00:14:40,963
Wings were free for ladies
if they took their top off.

327
00:14:41,046 --> 00:14:42,464
Oh, boy. [clears throat]

328
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:43,632
-Chidi, a word?
-Yeah.

329
00:14:44,425 --> 00:14:48,637
Anyway, that's how this simple soup
saved over 10,000 lives.

330
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:51,098
[Michael] Ah! Fabulous!

331
00:14:51,181 --> 00:14:53,893
If Jianyu starts talking about
topless Buffalo wing restaurants,

332
00:14:53,976 --> 00:14:55,144
we're all screwed.

333
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:59,356
[Michael] Jianyu Li, a Taiwanese monk
who took a vow of silence

334
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,566
at the age of eight

335
00:15:00,983 --> 00:15:02,568
and hasn't spoken since,

336
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:04,403
is ready to share with us.

337
00:15:08,282 --> 00:15:12,411
Let me tell you about Stupid Nick.

338
00:15:14,371 --> 00:15:17,374
We need a distraction. Right the fork now!

339
00:15:19,835 --> 00:15:21,420
No, no, no, no, no. [stutters] Eleanor?

340
00:15:21,503 --> 00:15:23,756
Chef Patricia poured her heart
and soul into this.

341
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:25,925
Destroying it would be a truly cruel act.

342
00:15:26,008 --> 00:15:27,676
Yeah, no durr.

343
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,428
-No, no, no! Oh!
-[sighs]

[Micheal] Sinkhole! Everyone out!

346

There's a sinkhole!

349
00:15:47,696 --> 00:15:50,240
You broke the world.

350
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52,284
It's not a compliment!

352
00:15:55,913 --> 00:15:57,998
Glenn, stay calm.
We're gonna get you out of there.

353
00:15:58,082 --> 00:16:01,293
And we'll put your soup in the
fridge so it won't go to waste.

354
00:16:02,044 --> 00:16:05,297
I know that may not be your number one
concern right now, but...

355
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:07,800
It was up there. It's real good soup.

356
00:16:07,883 --> 00:16:08,842
Let's go.

357
00:16:10,761 --> 00:16:12,596
Hey, buddy. You okay?

358
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:14,181
No.

359
00:16:14,264 --> 00:16:18,811
I was just about to tell an awesome story
about a wing-eating contest that I lost,

360
00:16:18,894 --> 00:16:22,564
and a barfing contest that I won,
but then a hole opened up in the ground.

361
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:25,859
I know. I made the hole
to save you from yourself.

362
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:29,321
You cannot let people know
who you really are.

363
00:16:29,405 --> 00:16:32,116
It would be very, very bad.

364
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:37,454
[Pillboi] Beautiful,
beautiful Jacksonville.

365
00:16:39,206 --> 00:16:40,457
What's wrong, dog?

366
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:42,084
You look like you're freaking out.

367
00:16:42,167 --> 00:16:44,044
Things are bad, Pillboi.

368
00:16:44,128 --> 00:16:47,506
Acidcat is suing me
for "bleach of contract."

369
00:16:47,589 --> 00:16:49,466
I should have never pretended
to be someone else.

370
00:16:50,134 --> 00:16:51,593
It could cost me all my dreams in life.

371
00:16:52,052 --> 00:16:54,304
You got dreams in life? That's lit.

372
00:16:54,388 --> 00:16:56,140
Of course I have dreams, man.

373
00:16:56,724 --> 00:16:58,726
I don't want to be a DJ
in Jacksonville forever.

374
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:04,732
I want to DJ in Daytona, Tallahassee,
Tampa, even.

375
00:17:05,274 --> 00:17:06,692
I want it all.

376
00:17:06,775 --> 00:17:08,777
That's big goals, man.

377
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:11,447
I know, but I believe in myself.

378
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:13,991
Someday, the world will see
what I already know,

379
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:19,496
that Jason Mendoza
is a beautiful, unique soul

380
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:21,582
who has so much to give this world.

381
00:17:24,668 --> 00:17:27,254
Okay, that's Acidcat's speedboat.
Hand me the thing that blows it up.

382
00:17:29,006 --> 00:17:30,215
[indistinct yells]

383
00:17:37,264 --> 00:17:39,892
Michael, I hereby tender my resignation.

384
00:17:39,975 --> 00:17:41,351
I can no longer in good conscience

385
00:17:41,435 --> 00:17:43,437
coordinate any further events
in The Good Place.

386
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:46,148
So, I am turning in my evening gloves.

387
00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:48,650
-Tahani--
-Don't try to make me feel better.

388
00:17:49,151 --> 00:17:50,444
The launch was a disaster.

389
00:17:50,527 --> 00:17:54,156
Poor Jianyu was so terrified
that I fear he may never speak again.

390
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:56,575
My hair is barely cascading
down my shoulders.

391
00:17:56,658 --> 00:17:58,035
Tahani, please.

392
00:17:59,036 --> 00:18:02,331
I know your journey with Jianyu
has been frustrating,

393
00:18:02,956 --> 00:18:06,126
but your situation is actually
very typical.

394
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:09,546
Soul mates sometimes take months
to really click.

395
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:11,006
You have to be patient.

396
00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:15,385
And if anyone should take the blame
for the restaurant disaster, it's me.

397
00:18:15,469 --> 00:18:18,180
I thought this neighborhood's
troubles were behind us.

398
00:18:19,014 --> 00:18:20,349
Now I fear the worst.

399
00:18:21,225 --> 00:18:22,476
Michael,

400
00:18:22,893 --> 00:18:25,479
I hereby rescind
the tendering of my resignation.

401
00:18:25,562 --> 00:18:27,189
We must keep the neighborhood together.

402
00:18:27,272 --> 00:18:28,482
-What can I do?
-Oh,

403
00:18:28,565 --> 00:18:31,902
well, the sinkhole should be repairing
itself in about three days.

404
00:18:31,985 --> 00:18:34,279
Well, as soon as it does,
we shall re-launch the restaurant.

405
00:18:34,822 --> 00:18:36,740
I'll hang posters to get the word out,

406
00:18:36,824 --> 00:18:39,868
and in the meantime, I'll host
a brunch party every morning

407
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:41,036
to lift people's spirits.

408
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,372
-Ah!
-While you repair the universe,

409
00:18:43,455 --> 00:18:45,415
I shall prepare the eggs.

410
00:18:45,499 --> 00:18:47,417
Oh, fanciful wordplay.

411
00:18:47,501 --> 00:18:50,838
Indeed. That is the Tahani
that you know and love.

412
00:18:53,841 --> 00:18:56,218
-So what do we do here?
-There's nothing to do.

413
00:18:56,301 --> 00:18:57,719
He's just gonna blab

414
00:18:57,803 --> 00:19:00,514
and get him and me both sent
to The Bad Place.

415
00:19:00,597 --> 00:19:01,723
It's hopeless.

416
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:04,184
[gunshot and explosions over TV]

417
00:19:05,853 --> 00:19:08,397
I can't believe I'm doing this,
but, Jason,

418
00:19:09,231 --> 00:19:11,567
please come to my classroom.

419
00:19:12,025 --> 00:19:15,571
I will teach you ethics,
like I'm doing with Eleanor.

420
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:18,615
And if you work hard
and absorb the material,

421
00:19:18,699 --> 00:19:20,701
you just might be able
to earn your place here.

422
00:19:24,413 --> 00:19:25,664
No, I'm good.

423
00:19:25,747 --> 00:19:26,999
[gunshots over TV]

424
00:19:27,082 --> 00:19:29,877
Dude, Chidi is giving you
a lifeline right now,

425
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:32,504
and you need to take it because you suck.

426
00:19:32,588 --> 00:19:35,299
-You suck!
-I know!

427
00:19:35,382 --> 00:19:38,260
That's what I'm trying to tell you.
We both suck.

428
00:19:38,343 --> 00:19:40,304
You know who doesn't suck? Chidi.

429
00:19:40,387 --> 00:19:43,182
He is putting himself in danger
to help us,

430
00:19:43,265 --> 00:19:46,310
because he, unlike us,
is an amazing person.

431
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:49,438
I didn't get into heaven to go to school.

432
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:52,608
You didn't get into heaven
at all, shirt-for-brains.

433
00:19:52,691 --> 00:19:53,734
I just want to be myself.

434
00:19:53,817 --> 00:19:57,404
That's a very, very bad idea.
Do not be yourself.

435
00:19:57,487 --> 00:20:00,032
You need to be a better version
of yourself, okay?

436
00:20:00,115 --> 00:20:05,662
And I do too. And our only hope right now
is this kind, selfless, amazing nerd.

437
00:20:05,746 --> 00:20:06,914
Think about that.

438
00:20:07,414 --> 00:20:08,916
[stutters] Do you have to call me
a nerd so much?

439
00:20:08,999 --> 00:20:12,127
I said a lot of other nice things, okay?
Toughen up, nerd.

Wow. Uh, that's really impressive.

00:20:25,849 --> 00:20:26,934
Uh, where's Jianyu?

446
00:20:27,017 --> 00:20:29,102
Honestly, I don't even know
if he's coming.

447
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:33,148
I am here to learn about ethnics.

[stutters] It's ethics but that's great.

450
00:20:40,113 --> 00:20:41,406

{\an8}When are football tryouts?

455
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:53,418
{\an8}And does this school have a prom?

456
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:56,129
{\an8}Oh, no.
