00:00:08,425 --> 00:00:10,218
[Dave] Morning, Mike. How's it hanging?

3
00:00:10,301 --> 00:00:12,429
Oh. Fine, Dave, just fine.

4
00:00:12,512 --> 00:00:15,056
Listen, we got the files
for the new crop of incoming,

5
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:17,767
and the Big Guy thinks it's time
for you to fly solo.

6
00:00:19,144 --> 00:00:20,895
I get to design it myself?

7
00:00:20,979 --> 00:00:23,648
You've been an apprentice long enough.
You're ready.

8
00:00:26,025 --> 00:00:28,069
Oh, Dave, I'm gonna work so hard.

9
00:00:28,153 --> 00:00:32,032
-My design is gonna be absolutely perfect.
-[chuckles] Easy there, rookie.

10
00:00:32,115 --> 00:00:34,659
Starting immediately, you'll be reporting
directly to the front office.

11
00:00:35,452 --> 00:00:37,704
This is your shot. Good luck.

12
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,965
[Shawn] The Bad Place is owed two people.

13
00:00:49,048 --> 00:00:51,968
You have all done bad things
since you arrived here.

14
00:00:52,051 --> 00:00:54,929
I don't care which two of you go.
You can decide.

15
00:00:55,013 --> 00:00:56,765
You have 30 minutes.

16
00:00:56,848 --> 00:00:58,016

[beeping]

18
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:02,437
All I ever wanted was
for this neighborhood,

19
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:05,231
my first neighborhood to be perfect.

20
00:01:05,315 --> 00:01:09,194
Somehow I blew it and...
Well, you're all suffering,

21
00:01:09,861 --> 00:01:11,780
and for that, I'm deeply sorry.

22
00:01:17,494 --> 00:01:20,455
This is truly the saddest day of my life.

23
00:01:20,538 --> 00:01:22,624

-[sighs]
-Okay, I guess I'll speak first.

26
00:01:36,596 --> 00:01:38,473
Jason and I are the mistakes.

27
00:01:38,556 --> 00:01:43,019
{\an8}We're the ones who misled everybody
and dragged you all into this mess, so,

28
00:01:43,102 --> 00:01:44,229
{\an8}we should go to The Bad Place.

29
00:01:44,312 --> 00:01:45,271
{\an8}-Agreed.
-Yes.

30
00:01:45,355 --> 00:01:49,234
{\an8}Okay, I thought you were gonna at least
pretend to fight me on that, but whatever.

31
00:01:49,317 --> 00:01:53,446
{\an8}Hang on. That judge guy just said
everyone here has done bad things.

32
00:01:54,197 --> 00:01:55,698
{\an8}Let's look at this ethnically.

33
00:01:55,782 --> 00:01:59,119
{\an8}-"Ethically."
-You guys helped me and Eleanor, right,

34
00:01:59,202 --> 00:02:02,539
{\an8}but we're bad, so you helping us was bad.

35
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:05,625
{\an8}It's basic consequentialism,
the morality of an action

36
00:02:05,708 --> 00:02:07,293
{\an8}is solely judged on its consequences.

37
00:02:07,377 --> 00:02:08,920
{\an8}Great. [chuckles]

38
00:02:09,003 --> 00:02:12,215
{\an8}The one time you actually
remember something from class.

39
00:02:12,298 --> 00:02:14,759
{\an8}Maybe I was brought here by mistake,
but since we've been here,

40
00:02:14,843 --> 00:02:16,845
{\an8}I just tried to stay
out of everyone's way.

41
00:02:16,928 --> 00:02:18,596
{\an8}Chidi's done worse stuff than me.

42
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:21,015
{\an8}He murdered Janet. He killed my wife!

43
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:22,892
{\an8}I was trying to stop you from doing it!

44
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:25,520
{\an8}Yeah, but you did it.
He who smelt it murdered Janet.

45
00:02:25,603 --> 00:02:27,105
Well, it's settled then.

46
00:02:27,188 --> 00:02:29,232
Eleanor and Jianyu are leaving.

47
00:02:29,315 --> 00:02:30,775
For the last time, my name is Jason,

48
00:02:30,859 --> 00:02:32,902
not Jianyu, the amazing
and incredible monk.

49
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:34,988
Which is why you belong in The Bad Place.

50
00:02:35,071 --> 00:02:39,117
And by the way, Janet is not your wife,
or your soulmate.

51
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:42,287
-There's a Janet in every neighborhood.
-Well, I'm in love with this Janet.

52
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:45,748
We did a bunch of amazing, awesome stuff
which almost turned out to be sex,

53
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:48,459
-and we were married in a legal ceremony.
-It was not legal.

54
00:02:48,543 --> 00:02:50,461
Okay, J-bones, you and me, outside.

55
00:02:50,545 --> 00:02:52,463
What? But...

56
00:02:52,547 --> 00:02:54,674
I'm not going. I don't wanna.

57
00:02:54,757 --> 00:02:58,219
Well, I don't wanna either,
but let's face it.

58
00:02:58,928 --> 00:03:01,723
Chidi and Tahani
are better people than we are.

59
00:03:01,806 --> 00:03:05,435
We tried to improve ourselves
and we did a good job.

60
00:03:05,518 --> 00:03:06,936
Well, I did a good job.

61
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:09,814
You mostly fell asleep in class
or made fart noises with your hands.

62
00:03:09,898 --> 00:03:12,275
-I could never do that on Earth.
-[fart noises]

63
00:03:12,358 --> 00:03:14,694
This place truly is paradise.

-[Tahani] Look at them.
-[sighs]

Whispering away like
two beefeaters on a tea break.

66
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:24,078
-I bet they're plotting against us.
-No way. Eleanor wouldn't do that.

67
00:03:24,913 --> 00:03:26,623
You do have feelings for her, don't you?

68
00:03:26,706 --> 00:03:27,999
[stutters] Yes.

69
00:03:28,082 --> 00:03:30,960
But no. Please don't make me think
about this again. My brain will break.

70
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:34,047
I'm sorry, it's just that I have
certain feelings for you.

71
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:37,926
I don't mean to contribute to your misery,
it's just that I'm frightened.

72
00:03:38,009 --> 00:03:40,386
I don't have an actual soulmate.

73
00:03:41,262 --> 00:03:44,182
What's gonna happen to me
when Jason and Fake Eleanor go

74
00:03:44,265 --> 00:03:46,351
-and you're off with Real Eleanor?
-[sighs]

75
00:03:47,393 --> 00:03:48,561
Whither Tahani?

76
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:50,313
Okay, team meeting. [sighs]

77
00:03:50,396 --> 00:03:53,483
Jason has agreed
that the two of us should go.

78
00:03:54,943 --> 00:03:56,069
Bye, Tahani.

79
00:03:56,152 --> 00:03:58,071
Sorry for everything.

80
00:03:58,154 --> 00:04:01,824
After I'm gone, you can go ahead
and clean out my bud hole.

81
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:03,534
Thank you.

82
00:04:06,037 --> 00:04:08,748
I love you so much, baby.
Promise me you'll visit.

83
00:04:08,831 --> 00:04:10,500
I will not.

84
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:12,919
It is literally impossible
for me to do that.

85
00:04:14,837 --> 00:04:16,798
Well, it's been real, dawg.

86
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:20,635
Sorry, that's how I ended
most of my serious relationships.

87
00:04:20,718 --> 00:04:22,887
Yeah. Mmm, that checks out.

88
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:25,974
I feel like I failed you.

89
00:04:26,057 --> 00:04:29,143
No. Don't ever think that.

90
00:04:31,521 --> 00:04:36,401
I was dropped into a cave,
and you were my flashlight.

91
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,361
[Tahani] Oh!

92
00:04:38,444 --> 00:04:40,071
Goodbye forever.

93
00:04:40,863 --> 00:04:42,949
I will miss you so much.

94
00:04:43,032 --> 00:04:46,077
Ugh. I'll miss you too,
you sexy skyscraper.

95
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:50,999
All right. [sighs] Ready to go?
Let's grab Michael.

96
00:04:51,082 --> 00:04:52,208
[knock at door]

97
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:53,626
[Eleanor] Come in.

98
00:04:54,669 --> 00:04:56,337
Hi, guys. Sorry to interrupt.

99
00:04:56,421 --> 00:05:00,591
Um, I'm going to The Bad Place.
I'm taking one of the slots.

100
00:05:00,675 --> 00:05:01,884
-What?
-Awesome.

101
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:05,638
Eleanor, that's crazy. You belong here.
Why would you go?

102
00:05:05,722 --> 00:05:08,725
Everyone here is supposed
to have a soulmate,

103
00:05:09,517 --> 00:05:12,228
and my soulmate doesn't love me.

104
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:19,027
I don't know if you love the other Eleanor
or Tahani or someone else,

105
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:23,531
but you don't love me,
which means that this

106
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:26,993
will never really be my Good Place.

107
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:32,040
I'm going, so you only have
to choose one more person.

108
00:05:33,249 --> 00:05:34,584
[door closes]

109
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:37,128
[stutters] Okay, that means...

110
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:38,921
What does that mean?

111
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:40,715
It means...

112
00:05:41,257 --> 00:05:44,761
I get to stay here with my wife forever!
We did it, Eleanor!

113
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:48,431
USA! USA! USA!

114
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:54,812
[sighs] This is a real mess, huh?

115
00:05:54,896 --> 00:05:56,522
No matter what they decide,
I'd bet you're gonna be

116
00:05:56,606 --> 00:05:58,733
in pretty hot water with your boss.

117
00:05:58,816 --> 00:06:01,778
Wouldn't be surprised
if retirement were on the table.

118
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:04,781
Retirement?

119
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:06,532
Of course, what do I know?

120
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:09,243
I'm just The All-Knowing Judge
of All Matters in the Afterlife.

121
00:06:09,327 --> 00:06:12,246
But face it, this is your mistake.

122
00:06:13,956 --> 00:06:16,042
-[Val] Morning, Mike.
-Morning, Val.

123
00:06:16,167 --> 00:06:18,753
Oh. Which one's which? I always forget.

124
00:06:18,836 --> 00:06:21,214
Black is regular, orange is anti-matter.

125
00:06:23,341 --> 00:06:26,302
Working on your first solo design, right?

126
00:06:26,427 --> 00:06:28,346
How's it coming?

127
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:33,559
Do you ever get the feeling
we could be doing it all differently?

128
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:36,771
I mean, it's always the same.
We get the names,

129
00:06:37,355 --> 00:06:41,484
come up with the design, they arrive,
we move on to the next one.

130
00:06:42,193 --> 00:06:46,155
We never even get to be there
to see how fun it is.

131
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,907
Yeah, I guess,

132
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:51,077
but don't rock the boat here, pal,
just try to do a good job.

133
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:54,664
Mmm. French vanilla?

134
00:06:54,747 --> 00:06:56,707
Regular anti-matter's fine. Why flavor it?

135
00:06:58,709 --> 00:07:00,628
A good job.

136
00:07:14,225 --> 00:07:16,811
[Eleanor] All right, nerds,
let's just get this over with.

137
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,605
I'll go to The Bad Place
with Real Eleanor,

138
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:20,982
-and you three can stay.
-[Jianyu] Yes!

139
00:07:21,065 --> 00:07:22,984
We get to stay, baby! We did it!

140
00:07:23,067 --> 00:07:25,611
Wait, no. You're not going.

141
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:27,864
I am.

142
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:29,615
-What?
-Why?

143
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:32,869
Real Eleanor is my soulmate
or was my soulmate

144
00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:35,663
and she's only going down there
because she thinks that I don't love her.

145
00:07:35,746 --> 00:07:37,039
-Do you?
-I don't know.

146
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:38,374
Please don't ask me that.
My stomach hurts.

147
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:41,210
The point is, if she's going
down there because of me,

148
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:42,378
I'll never be at peace.

149
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:46,215
-Yes! We get to stay, baby! We did it!
-No, this is bonkers.

150
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:50,344
-I am going. End of story.
-No, I'm going. End of everything.

151
00:07:50,428 --> 00:07:52,638
What? Now you're trying to replace Chidi?

152
00:07:52,722 --> 00:07:56,684
No. I'm going to replace Real Eleanor.
Chidi and I are going to go together,

153
00:07:56,767 --> 00:07:59,437
which means that you
and Real Eleanor and Jason can stay.

154
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,647
Yes! We get to stay, baby! We did it!

155
00:08:01,731 --> 00:08:05,776
Look, I love you and I think you love me.

156
00:08:05,902 --> 00:08:09,322
We can be together,
away from everyone else.

157
00:08:09,405 --> 00:08:11,240
Obviously, we'll be miserable,

158
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:14,660
but I truly believe
our love will make us happy.

159
00:08:14,744 --> 00:08:18,539
Okay, you realize The Bad Place is not
some sort of couples retreat, right?

160
00:08:18,623 --> 00:08:20,416
If it is, Janet and I would like to go.

161
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:22,585
Oh, that's enough out of you, robot lover.

162
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:24,086
-Hey, that's racist!
-Not a robot.

163
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:26,214
Oh, you have some nerve.

164
00:08:26,297 --> 00:08:28,716
-Guys?
-[all arguing]

165
00:08:28,799 --> 00:08:30,051
Guys!

166
00:08:31,052 --> 00:08:32,345
[exhales deeply]

167
00:08:32,428 --> 00:08:34,096
[all continue arguing]

168

00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:45,733
What?

170
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:48,027
Wow!

171
00:08:48,694 --> 00:08:51,197
[laughing] Okay, okay.

172
00:08:51,322 --> 00:08:52,657
Whoo!

173
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:56,202
Yo, Mikey! Shawn! Come on out!

174
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:00,748
Is everything okay?

175
00:09:01,249 --> 00:09:03,167
Right as rain, Mikey, my boy.

176
00:09:03,251 --> 00:09:06,254
So, Chidi and I are gonna go
to The Bad Place.

177
00:09:06,337 --> 00:09:08,631
-What?
-Trust me, I've got this.

178
00:09:09,423 --> 00:09:11,008
That's our decision. Let's hit it.

179
00:09:11,092 --> 00:09:13,177
Well, what about Real Eleanor?

180
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:15,137
No, it's me and Chidi. Call the train.

181
00:09:17,014 --> 00:09:19,141
Point of order. I don't accept this offer.

182
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:21,060
The real mistakes were Jason and Eleanor.

183
00:09:21,143 --> 00:09:23,020
Ga-ga-ga-ga. You said any two of us.

184
00:09:23,104 --> 00:09:25,231
It's me and Chidi. Let's do it to it.

185
00:09:26,774 --> 00:09:29,026
Michael! I just found an obscure precedent

186
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:30,987
in the rules
that might just save everyone.

187
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:33,322
Buzz off, Bambadjan! Don't need it.

188
00:09:35,032 --> 00:09:37,076
Oh, okay. [chuckles softly]

189
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:40,121
Ready when you are, boss.

190
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:41,998
[Chidi] Eleanor, what's going on?

191
00:09:42,498 --> 00:09:44,625
It took me a while to figure it out,

192
00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:48,713
but just now as we were all
fighting and yelling at each other

193
00:09:48,796 --> 00:09:51,257
and each one of us demanding
we should go to The Bad Place,

194
00:09:52,174 --> 00:09:55,177
I thought to myself,
"Man, this is torture."

195
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:57,763
And then it hit me.

196
00:09:57,847 --> 00:10:01,684
They're never gonna call a train
to take us to The Bad Place.

197
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:05,521
The can't, because we're already here.

198
00:10:07,523 --> 00:10:09,567
This is The Bad Place.

199
00:10:19,535 --> 00:10:21,871
[laughs wickedly]

200
00:10:21,954 --> 00:10:23,289
Oh, man!

201
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:26,667
I can't believe you figured it out.

202
00:10:27,168 --> 00:10:31,380
[laughs wickedly] Oh, God!

203
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:33,883
You, you ruined everything, you know that?

204
00:10:36,719 --> 00:10:38,512
[Michael laughs] Oh, man.

205
00:10:38,596 --> 00:10:40,973
Eleanor, you really suck!

206
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:43,225
-[gasps]
-I was so close to pulling it off!

207
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:45,227
[grunting]

208
00:10:49,106 --> 00:10:50,316
[clatters]

209
00:10:51,108 --> 00:10:53,027
Sorry. So she's right?

210
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:54,820
Yeah, she figured it out.

211
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:58,366
[stutters] No,
this doesn't make any sense.

212
00:10:58,449 --> 00:11:02,203
-This is paradise.
-Oh, it looks like paradise,

213
00:11:02,286 --> 00:11:07,416
but it's actually a filthy dumpster
full of our worst anxieties.

214
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:11,253
I'm surrounded by people
who are literally better than me.

215
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:14,882
Just me being here forced Chidi
into an ethical "clusterfork."

216
00:11:14,965 --> 00:11:18,052
Tahani tortured Jason
by constantly trying to get him to talk,

217
00:11:18,135 --> 00:11:20,679
Jason tortured me because I was sure
he would blow our cover,

218
00:11:20,763 --> 00:11:23,641
which was torture for Chidi,
because he was responsible for me,

219
00:11:23,724 --> 00:11:26,143
which made Chidi seem
like the perfect soulmate,

220
00:11:26,227 --> 00:11:28,646
and that tortured Tahani
because he didn't love her.

221
00:11:28,729 --> 00:11:31,357
-You don't love me?
-Please, don't ask me that right now.

222
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,483
See?

223
00:11:32,566 --> 00:11:36,237
We've been torturing each other
since the moment we arrived,

224
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:40,074
and everything Michael has done
has made at least one of us miserable.

225
00:11:40,157 --> 00:11:43,536
-He played us like a fiddle.
-Oh, dip!

226
00:11:43,619 --> 00:11:46,831
Eleanor, I told you that first night
that we were in a prank show.

227
00:11:46,914 --> 00:11:48,124
Oh, yeah.

228
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:51,419
-You did! Great job, man.
-[Jianyu laughs]

229
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:53,712
Chidi, don't go!

230
00:11:53,796 --> 00:11:56,715
I don't care if you don't love me,
I love you.

231
00:11:57,299 --> 00:12:00,636
It's the only thing that makes
any sense to me in this crazy world,

232
00:12:00,719 --> 00:12:04,765
-and I think we should stay--
-No, stop, Vicky. They figured it out.

233
00:12:05,808 --> 00:12:08,602
-They...
-They know this is The Bad Place.

234
00:12:08,686 --> 00:12:10,354
Eleanor figured it out.

235
00:12:13,774 --> 00:12:15,317
Ugh, man!

236
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:16,861
This was supposed to be my big moment.

237
00:12:16,944 --> 00:12:19,864
I just rehearsed that speech
for, like, three hours.

238
00:12:20,656 --> 00:12:23,200
Damn it, Eleanor, you are the worst,

239
00:12:23,284 --> 00:12:25,327
and you can all suck it.

240
00:12:26,662 --> 00:12:28,747
-[door slams]
-Do you remember what I told you

241
00:12:28,831 --> 00:12:31,959
when you predicted you could
do this for 1,000 years?

242
00:12:33,002 --> 00:12:35,796
The time has come to innovate.

243
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:41,552
The human afterlife can be more fun.

244
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:45,848
For us, obviously,
not for the people we're torturing.

245
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:47,308
Who cares about those dummies?

246
00:12:47,391 --> 00:12:49,059
-[laughs wickedly]
-[scattered laughter]

247
00:12:49,143 --> 00:12:53,314
I present to you the perfect recipe
for my proposed experiment.

248
00:12:53,397 --> 00:12:58,027
Four people, perfectly suited
to make each other miserable.

249
00:12:58,527 --> 00:13:01,030
I am going to design an afterlife

250
00:13:01,113 --> 00:13:03,949
where they torture each other.

251
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:07,203
We've tried this. Humans are very
reticent to torture each other.

252
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:09,205
Even getting them to do simple things

253
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:11,332
like pulling out each other's teeth
is like...

254
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:15,002
I can't think of the right analogy.

255
00:13:15,085 --> 00:13:16,879
Uh, what makes you think
that you can get them to do this?

256
00:13:16,962 --> 00:13:20,049
Because they won't even know
that they are doing it.

257
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:24,136
I'm going to make them think
that they are in The Good Place,

258
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:27,598
and to make sure
that they drive each other insane,

259
00:13:27,681 --> 00:13:32,686
I will be there,
posing as a Good Place architect.

260
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:33,812
-What?
-[murmuring]

261
00:13:33,896 --> 00:13:36,023
I even stole
a Good Place Janet we can use.

262
00:13:36,106 --> 00:13:37,358
-[scoffs]
-[Michael] Look,

263
00:13:37,441 --> 00:13:40,986
we can just send them all to the
hot spike pits with the lava and the bees

264
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:42,905
and the lightning that tears off
their flesh.

265
00:13:42,988 --> 00:13:45,157
Let's try something new.

266
00:13:45,241 --> 00:13:48,077
I cannot predict everything
that's gonna happen,

267
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,370
but we'll improvise.

268
00:13:49,453 --> 00:13:51,038
We'll be on our toes.

269
00:13:51,121 --> 00:13:53,999
I think that we can get them
to torture each other...

270
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:56,502
For 1,000 years.

271
00:13:56,585 --> 00:14:01,215
I think you'd be lucky to get six months
out of this insane gambit.

272
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:06,887
But take me through it.
How would this work, exactly?

273
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:09,848
Oh. Yes, all right, so... [clears throat]

274
00:14:09,932 --> 00:14:12,518
-This is a 14 million-point plan.
-[footsteps approaching]

275
00:14:14,103 --> 00:14:15,938
Um... Oh. Sorry.

276
00:14:16,021 --> 00:14:18,357
I thought we reserved the conference room.

277
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:20,109
No, Todd, we have it until 3:00.

278
00:14:20,192 --> 00:14:22,152
Sorry. Sorry, everyone.

279
00:14:22,736 --> 00:14:25,030
So, everyone else in this neighborhood--

280
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:26,699
Except for you four,

281
00:14:26,782 --> 00:14:30,035
everyone in this neighborhood
is one of us.

282
00:14:30,744 --> 00:14:32,997
After I came up
with everyone's characters,

283
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:35,791
we'd just create fun scenarios
designed to torture you.

284
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:39,879
How can I be over it? We haven't
discussed it or even spoken for days.

285
00:14:39,962 --> 00:14:43,674
Well, it sounds like you've had a really
nice vacation from your full-time job.

286
00:14:43,757 --> 00:14:45,050
Get your story straight.

287
00:14:45,968 --> 00:14:47,344
Okay.

288
00:14:47,428 --> 00:14:50,139
They're at each other's throats already.
This should put them over the top.

289
00:14:50,222 --> 00:14:53,183
-Ed, you play Bart, a former private eye.
-Ooh.

290
00:14:53,267 --> 00:14:55,811
I know. Tracy, you're his soulmate,

291
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:57,062
Nina, a marriage counselor.

292
00:14:57,146 --> 00:14:59,523
[laughing] Maybe we can get them
to swing with us.

293
00:14:59,607 --> 00:15:00,774
[all laughing]

294
00:15:01,442 --> 00:15:03,777
That's perfect, perfect! [shushing]

295
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:06,447
Hey, guys? It's Michael!

296
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:07,656
[both groaning]

297
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:09,867
[Michael] <i>That was really a fun time.</i>

298
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:12,828
Then it all started to go off the rails.

299
00:15:14,163 --> 00:15:15,164
When I confessed.

300
00:15:16,206 --> 00:15:18,626
<i>You had no idea I was gonna do that,</i>

301
00:15:18,709 --> 00:15:21,462
<i>because honestly, </i>
<i>I had no idea I was gonna do that.</i>

302
00:15:21,545 --> 00:15:23,339
<i>[Michael] Yeah, that came out of nowhere.</i>

303
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:26,717
I mean, after that, it was just
a crazy scramble for all of us.

304
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,553
You know, I, I definitely underestimated

305
00:15:29,637 --> 00:15:32,640
how effective Chidi was gonna be
teaching you to be good,

306
00:15:32,723 --> 00:15:36,977
and obviously, we didn't anticipate
that Janet would fall in love with Jason.

307
00:15:37,061 --> 00:15:39,605
Hang on. That part is real.

308
00:15:39,688 --> 00:15:42,399
Oh, yeah. Janet isn't one of us.

309
00:15:42,483 --> 00:15:45,569
No, she's sort of a... [sighs]
Foundational mainframe

310
00:15:45,653 --> 00:15:47,738
for all of the neighborhoods,
good and bad.

311
00:15:48,405 --> 00:15:51,575
And apparently,
this Janet is in love with Jason.

312
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:53,744
I mean... [chuckles] What a world, huh?

313
00:15:53,827 --> 00:15:55,245
[Eleanor] Wait, I don't get something.

314
00:15:55,329 --> 00:15:59,667
I know why Jason and I were
sent here, but why Tahani?

315
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:03,671
Oh, yeah. Didn't you raise, like,
$1,000 for charity, or whatever?

316
00:16:03,754 --> 00:16:07,174
Uh, 60 billion, actually, so.

317
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:10,010
Oh.

318
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:12,638
But it didn't matter...

319
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:15,724
Because my motivations were corrupt.

320
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:20,145
I didn't care about helping
the people I raised the money for.

321
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:23,023
<i>I just wanted to prove my parents wrong,</i>

322
00:16:23,107 --> 00:16:24,858
<i>stick it to my sister,</i>

323
00:16:25,192 --> 00:16:26,986
<i>get fame and attention.</i>

324
00:16:27,069 --> 00:16:30,239
My only real goal
was to snog Ryan Gosling at the Met Ball.

325
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:32,908
Which I did.

326
00:16:33,575 --> 00:16:34,868
Couple of times, actually.

327
00:16:34,952 --> 00:16:36,954
But wait, why is Chidi here?

328
00:16:37,037 --> 00:16:38,831
Well, uh...

329
00:16:38,914 --> 00:16:41,458
There's something you don't know about me.

330
00:16:42,251 --> 00:16:44,920
I read an article saying
that growing almonds

331
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:48,757
was bad for the environment,
and yet I continued to use

332
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:52,052
-almond milk in my coffee--
-No, dingus!

333
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:57,516
You hurt everyone in your life with
your rigidity and your indecisiveness.

334
00:16:59,351 --> 00:17:01,979
Oh, fork!

335
00:17:02,062 --> 00:17:03,397
You're right.

336
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:07,234
<i>Every friend, every girlfriend</i>
<i>was driven nuts</i>

337
00:17:07,317 --> 00:17:09,403
<i>because I couldn't do anything.</i>

338
00:17:09,486 --> 00:17:10,821
<i>I missed my mom's back surgery</i>

339
00:17:10,904 --> 00:17:14,324
because I had already promised
my landlord's nephew

340
00:17:14,408 --> 00:17:16,785
that I would help him
figure out his new phone.

341
00:17:17,494 --> 00:17:19,413
I made everyone miserable.

342
00:17:19,496 --> 00:17:21,665
I mean, all this hard work,
all the planning,

343
00:17:21,749 --> 00:17:23,042
all for nothing.

344
00:17:23,834 --> 00:17:24,960
This really sucks.

345
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:26,420
No, it doesn't.

346
00:17:27,212 --> 00:17:28,672
This is wonderful.

347
00:17:28,756 --> 00:17:31,925
You saw us all on Earth,

348
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:36,263
a selfish ass, an idiot DJ,
a tortured academic,

349
00:17:36,346 --> 00:17:39,975
a hot, rich fraud with legs for days...

350
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:43,604
Side note, I might legit be into Tahani.

351
00:17:43,687 --> 00:17:45,981
[chuckles] But that's for another time.

352
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:48,901
You thought we would torture each other,

353
00:17:48,984 --> 00:17:50,611
and we did for a little,

354
00:17:50,694 --> 00:17:52,863
but we also took care of each other.

355
00:17:52,946 --> 00:17:55,199
We improved each other,

356
00:17:55,282 --> 00:17:57,117
and the four of us became a team.

357
00:17:57,826 --> 00:18:01,246
So, the only thing you succeeded in doing

358
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:03,248
was bringing us all together.

359
00:18:04,374 --> 00:18:07,920
Oh, Eleanor. That's it!

360
00:18:08,003 --> 00:18:11,965
My big mistake was
bringing you all together,

361
00:18:12,049 --> 00:18:15,219
having you be soulmates
living next to each other.

362
00:18:15,302 --> 00:18:19,139
Next time, I'll spread you out
so it's more of a slow burn.

363
00:18:19,223 --> 00:18:20,516
-Uh, next time?
-[Michael] Yeah.

364
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:22,601
Yeah, I'm gonna, uh, erase your memories,

365
00:18:22,684 --> 00:18:24,895
you know, make a few changes
and start over again.

366
00:18:24,978 --> 00:18:28,023
Hopefully. Just gotta get
the boss man to sign off.

367
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:29,566
Wish me luck.

368
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:36,365
Guys, we need a plan. Quick.

369
00:18:36,448 --> 00:18:37,449
Tahani, anything?

370
00:18:38,867 --> 00:18:40,452
Chidi, I need ya. You're the smart one.

371
00:18:40,536 --> 00:18:42,412
[stammering] I can't. I can't.

372
00:18:42,496 --> 00:18:44,373
-[Eleanor] Jason?
-What? What's up?

373
00:18:44,456 --> 00:18:45,457
Ugh!

374
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:48,043
What do you say? Take two, huh?

375
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:49,586
I don't know.

376
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:53,090
I mean, what is this?
All this work for four people.

377
00:18:53,173 --> 00:18:55,968
Look, for a first attempt
it was actually very promising.

378
00:18:56,051 --> 00:18:59,429
Let me, let me just
tinker a little, try again.

379
00:18:59,888 --> 00:19:01,140
Okay.

380
00:19:01,765 --> 00:19:04,059
But you're way out on a limb here, Mike.

381
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:07,563
If this thing goes sideways again,
you are done.

382
00:19:08,522 --> 00:19:10,858
Guys, he is going to erase
our memories at any second

383
00:19:10,941 --> 00:19:12,818
and all of this will have been
for nothing.

384
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:15,112
[grunts] You're useless!

385
00:19:17,781 --> 00:19:19,408
What do I write? What do I write?

386
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:20,909
Ooh, come on, brain.

387
00:19:25,539 --> 00:19:26,790
Janet?

388
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:29,334
You can't eat anything, right?

389
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:30,878
-Correct.
-Open up.

390
00:19:31,712 --> 00:19:34,131
All right, let's try again, shall we?

391
00:19:34,214 --> 00:19:37,009
You know what, bro? Do your worst.

392
00:19:37,092 --> 00:19:39,344
We figured it out once,
we can do it again,

393
00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:41,096
because you know what, Michael?

394
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:43,182
-Ya bas--
-[snaps fingers]

395
00:19:45,058 --> 00:19:46,935
[water flowing]

396
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,572
Eleanor, come on in.

397
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:02,326
You, Eleanor Shellstrop, are dead.

398
00:20:02,409 --> 00:20:03,952
Cool.

399
00:20:07,748 --> 00:20:09,541
[Michael] <i>You know the way you feel </i>
<i>when you see</i>

400
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:12,502
<i>a chimpanzee and a baby tiger</i>
<i>who've become friends?</i>

401
00:20:12,586 --> 00:20:13,795
[laughter]

402
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:16,757
<i>That's how you're going to feel every day.</i>

403
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:18,634
[laughter and applause]

404
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:20,135
[knock at door]

405
00:20:20,636 --> 00:20:23,263
Eleanor? I'm Chris Baker.

406
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:24,765
{\an8}I'm your soulmate.

407
00:20:24,848 --> 00:20:27,392
{\an8}Cool. Bring it in, man.

408
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:30,479
{\an8}So where are you from, Chris?

409
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:33,815
{\an8}I'm from Teaneck, New Jersey,
and I was a mailman.

410
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:36,401
{\an8}Really? [chuckles]

411
00:20:38,528 --> 00:20:42,074
{\an8}Chris, you'll stand by me
no matter what, right?

412
00:20:42,157 --> 00:20:45,202
{\an8}Hold that thought.
Is it okay if I go work out?

413
00:20:45,285 --> 00:20:49,915
{\an8}I love working out. I gotta stay jacked,
it's who I am.

414
00:20:49,998 --> 00:20:51,291
{\an8}Yeah, you gotta.

415
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:53,627
{\an8}Once I'm back,
we'll get to know each other.

416
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:54,753
{\an8}Great.

417
00:20:56,171 --> 00:20:58,257
-See ya soon.
-[door closes]

418
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:00,300
-Hi, there.
-[yelps and gasps]

419
00:21:00,384 --> 00:21:01,843
-Who are you?
-I'm Janet.

420
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:03,303
I think this is yours.

421
00:21:03,387 --> 00:21:05,639
After I was rebooted,
I found it in my mouth.

422
00:21:05,722 --> 00:21:06,974
What?

423
00:21:15,482 --> 00:21:17,526
What the fork is a "Chidi"?

424
00:21:18,318 --> 00:21:19,778
Why can't I say "fork"?

425
00:21:19,861 --> 00:21:21,196
[inhales]
