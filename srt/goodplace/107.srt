1
00:00:01,710 --> 00:00:03,586
{\an8}There's no escaping it.

2
00:00:04,546 --> 00:00:06,214
{\an8}The problem...

3
00:00:06,715 --> 00:00:08,049
{\an8}Is me.

4
00:00:08,133 --> 00:00:09,634
{\an8}-[all gasp]
-[Michael] And now...

5
00:00:10,969 --> 00:00:13,972
{\an8}I have to leave you... Forever.

6
00:00:14,264 --> 00:00:17,726
{\an8}Michael, you can't be the problem.

7
00:00:17,809 --> 00:00:19,269
Oh, but I am.

8
00:00:19,394 --> 00:00:21,563
You see, architects aren't
supposed to live

9
00:00:21,646 --> 00:00:23,148
in the neighborhoods they design,

10
00:00:24,274 --> 00:00:27,777
but I love humans, so I wanted to try.

11
00:00:27,861 --> 00:00:30,613
I see now that was a mistake.

12
00:00:30,697 --> 00:00:34,743
My meddling is the one true constant
in all of our disasters.

13
00:00:34,826 --> 00:00:41,416
I tried to force Jianyu into opening up,
which caused a sinkhole to open up.

14
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:46,379
I kicked a puppy into the sun,
and garbage rained down.

15
00:00:46,713 --> 00:00:49,924
I grossly underestimated
the number of shrimp needed

16
00:00:50,008 --> 00:00:51,301
for the opening-night party,

17
00:00:51,384 --> 00:00:53,970
and what flew through the sky
the next day,

18
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:56,473
taunting me for my failures?

19
00:00:56,556 --> 00:00:59,434
I'm sorry, everyone. I'm truly sorry.

20
00:00:59,517 --> 00:01:00,727
-Janet?
-[bell chimes]

21
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:04,355
Please call a train to escort
me into retirement.

22
00:01:04,647 --> 00:01:08,568
You see, the only way
in and out of a neighborhood is by train,

23
00:01:08,651 --> 00:01:11,613
and Janet is the only one
who can operate them.

24
00:01:11,696 --> 00:01:14,032
Oh, my dear Janet.

25
00:01:14,115 --> 00:01:16,701
-Will you be okay after I leave?
-Yes.

26
00:01:16,785 --> 00:01:19,704
This will not affect me in any way.

27
00:01:19,788 --> 00:01:21,706
Jeez, show some compassion.

28
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:23,958
Well, I can't feel sad,

29
00:01:24,042 --> 00:01:27,837
but here's my best approximation
of human crying.

30
00:01:29,422 --> 00:01:31,382
[fake bawling]

31
00:01:37,305 --> 00:01:40,809
-Oh, Janet, that was beautiful.
-Yeah.

32
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:45,438
{\an8}[theme song playing]

33
00:01:48,066 --> 00:01:50,902
What did you say to him?
Did you make him do this somehow?

34
00:01:50,985 --> 00:01:53,905
{\an8}Nope, this was entirely his idea.

35
00:01:53,988 --> 00:01:55,990
{\an8}Dude, this is good news.

36
00:01:56,074 --> 00:01:59,619
{\an8}Michael's gonna get a chill retirement,
which, frankly, he desperately needs,

37
00:01:59,702 --> 00:02:01,788
{\an8}and I can finally relax.

38
00:02:01,871 --> 00:02:03,164
{\an8}It's forking perfect.

39
00:02:03,248 --> 00:02:06,835
{\an8}No, it's terrible. Michael's wrong.
He's not the problem.

40
00:02:06,918 --> 00:02:08,795
{\an8}Well, Michael did bring me here,

41
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:11,464
{\an8}which was the mistake that led
to all the other problems.

42
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:15,468
{\an8}So, in that sense, he is the real problem.

43
00:02:15,552 --> 00:02:20,473
{\an8}Ha! How do you like them ethics?
I just ethics'd you in the face, Chidi!

44
00:02:20,557 --> 00:02:22,642
{\an8}It doesn't change the fact
that we weren't truthful.

45
00:02:22,725 --> 00:02:24,519
{\an8}There's an old Chinese proverb...

46
00:02:24,602 --> 00:02:28,314
{\an8}"Lies are like tigers. They are bad."

47
00:02:28,398 --> 00:02:30,275
{\an8}-That's it?
-It's more poetic in Mandarin.

48
00:02:30,358 --> 00:02:32,986
{\an8}Look, Michael is retiring.

49
00:02:33,069 --> 00:02:37,448
{\an8}He's gonna be on an angel boat somewhere,
smoking moonbeam cigars.

50
00:02:37,532 --> 00:02:39,784
{\an8}Now, Tahani is throwing him
a good-bye party.

51
00:02:39,868 --> 00:02:40,952
{\an8}Let's go help out.

52
00:02:41,035 --> 00:02:44,581
{\an8}Sure, that will more than make up
for the pain and misery and lying.

53
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:46,249
{\an8}Yes, now you're getting it.

54
00:02:48,459 --> 00:02:53,256
{\an8}Hey, Chidi, just read your article
on logical positivism... So dry.

55
00:02:53,339 --> 00:02:54,591
{\an8}Oh, thanks, Henry.

56
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:56,593
{\an8}Whoa! New boots.

57
00:02:56,676 --> 00:02:58,386
{\an8}Oh, yeah, just got 'em.

58
00:02:58,469 --> 00:03:01,347
{\an8}Saw them in the store,
and I was just like, "Whoa!"

59
00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:03,850
-[chuckles]
-Tell the truth... Do you like 'em?

60
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:05,685
Oh...

61
00:03:06,728 --> 00:03:08,479
-Oh, yeah.
-Not too red?

62
00:03:08,563 --> 00:03:10,023
-No.
-Crystals aren't too much?

63
00:03:10,106 --> 00:03:11,482
Crystals are not too much.

64
00:03:11,566 --> 00:03:14,068
Oh, well, that makes me feel much better
'cause I was really going back and forth

65
00:03:14,152 --> 00:03:16,362
over whether they were worth the money.
They were super expensive.

66
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:19,240
Yeah, well, they're, uh, amazing.

67
00:03:19,324 --> 00:03:21,451
Those are the coolest boots
I've ever seen in my life.

68
00:03:21,534 --> 00:03:22,911
Thanks so much, buddy.

69
00:03:22,994 --> 00:03:24,454
Right. [chuckles] Bye.

70
00:03:26,998 --> 00:03:28,333
My God...

71
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:30,668
What have I done?

72
00:03:31,628 --> 00:03:36,424
Tonight needs to be the perfect blend
of celebratory, reverential,

73
00:03:36,507 --> 00:03:39,802
bittersweet, upbeat, fun, and effortless.

74
00:03:40,261 --> 00:03:43,681
This is #TahaniTime.

75
00:03:44,098 --> 00:03:45,433
What is all this?

76
00:03:45,516 --> 00:03:46,768
Oh, no, Michael,

77
00:03:46,851 --> 00:03:48,978
you're not supposed to see it
till it's all set up.

78
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:53,608
But, well... [chuckles]
Welcome to your retirement party.

79
00:03:53,691 --> 00:03:54,901
-Hm.
-Look, over there, I've even set up

80
00:03:54,984 --> 00:03:58,238
a buffet of themed desserts,
like retire-mint chocolate cake...

81
00:03:58,321 --> 00:04:00,073
-Ah.
-Or a, flan-voyage.

82
00:04:00,323 --> 00:04:01,407
Oh, boy.

83
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:05,328
Oh, and here we have a piñata
shaped like you, which is always fun.

84
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:07,997
By the way, uh, what's
you're favorite color for the tablecloths?

85
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:10,833
Well, it's not perceptible by human eyes.

86
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:12,794
It's called pleurigloss.

87
00:04:12,877 --> 00:04:14,504
Could you describe it?

88
00:04:14,587 --> 00:04:16,589
It's the color of... [sighs]

89
00:04:16,673 --> 00:04:21,344
When a soldier comes home from war
and sees his dog for the first time.

90
00:04:21,427 --> 00:04:23,471
Hmm. How about blue?

91
00:04:23,554 --> 00:04:26,683
Tahani, I'm so sorry.
We need to cancel this party immediately.

92
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:28,059
[Tahani] But why?

93
00:04:28,142 --> 00:04:33,523
For a being like me, retirement...
Is not something fun.

94
00:04:33,606 --> 00:04:36,526
What is "retirement" for you exactly?

95
00:04:36,609 --> 00:04:39,112
[Michael] Well, I wasn't gonna share
this so as not to upset you,

96
00:04:39,195 --> 00:04:42,865
but it's, a... [sighs]
An extreme form of punishment.

97
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:45,368
We call it, "The Eternal Shriek."

98
00:04:45,451 --> 00:04:49,038
My soul will be disintegrated,
and each molecule will be placed

99
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:52,166
on the surface of a different burning sun.

100
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:56,004
And then my essence
will be scooped out of my body

101
00:04:56,087 --> 00:04:59,090
with a flaming ladle
and poured over hot diamonds.

102
00:04:59,173 --> 00:05:01,092
-Oh, but the diamonds sound lovely.
-They're not...

103
00:05:01,175 --> 00:05:03,052
-[Chidi grunts]
-And then what's left of my body

104
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:06,306
will be endlessly beaten
with a titanium rod, like a...

105
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:08,141
-[inhales sharply]
-Like a piñata.

106
00:05:08,224 --> 00:05:11,561
Yes, except you have
the string around my waist,

107
00:05:11,644 --> 00:05:14,564
but instead it will definitely
be around my genitals.

108
00:05:14,647 --> 00:05:17,692
-What?
-Oh, Michael, I'm so sorry.

109
00:05:17,775 --> 00:05:19,527
-Mm.
-I was just trying to honor you.

110
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:21,738
Please, allow me to re-conceive the event.

111
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:23,197
Of course.

112
00:05:24,657 --> 00:05:26,159
All right, everyone, we're starting over.

113
00:05:26,242 --> 00:05:28,786
The key word for tonight
is just, "Somber."

114
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:30,413
Jianyu, my love, we're gonna
have to get rid

115
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:33,875
of all of the party poppers immediately.
No, not by using them.

116
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:35,918
No, Jianyu. Done.

117
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:37,086
[pops]

118
00:05:38,129 --> 00:05:39,589
He's gonna be tortured?

119
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:42,592
Dang it. I was almost handed
a perfect solution

120
00:05:42,675 --> 00:05:45,219
to all my problems without
having to work for it at all,

121
00:05:45,303 --> 00:05:46,679
and now it's gone.

122
00:05:46,763 --> 00:05:49,932
[sighs] Why do bad things
always happen to mediocre people

123
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:51,559
who are lying about their identities?

124
00:05:51,642 --> 00:05:52,935
Okay, you have two options.

125
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:56,856
You can confess and save Michael,
or you can continue to lie

126
00:05:56,939 --> 00:06:00,109
and condemn him to an eternity
of unimaginable pain.

127
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:01,778
Or option C...

128
00:06:01,861 --> 00:06:05,114
Continue to lie about myself
and find a way to save Michael.

129
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:08,159
Can we somehow throw Tahani under the bus?

130
00:06:08,242 --> 00:06:11,120
That would be a classic
"two birds with one stone" scenario.

131
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:14,040
Plus, I'd get her house. Three birds.

132
00:06:14,123 --> 00:06:16,876
No, there's no way to stop
this except confessing.

133
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:19,295
Any moment now, Michael is going
to get on that train,

134
00:06:19,378 --> 00:06:22,632
and we will never see him again,
just like Professor Lindeman

135
00:06:22,715 --> 00:06:25,885
after I asked him to reread
my 3,600-page manuscript.

136
00:06:25,968 --> 00:06:27,804
He said he was going out for cigarettes,

137
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:31,265
but then he just left his tenured position
at the Sorbonne.

138
00:06:31,349 --> 00:06:32,934
Great story. Janet?

139
00:06:33,017 --> 00:06:33,976
-[bell chimes]
-Hi, there.

140
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:37,480
Hi. So the only way
out of the neighborhood is a train?

141
00:06:37,563 --> 00:06:39,148
That's correct. I am the only one

142
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:41,984
who can call the train,
and it needs me to operate.

143
00:06:42,151 --> 00:06:43,486
Choo-choo! [chuckles]

144
00:06:43,611 --> 00:06:47,949
One more question, and, um,
this is a little weird, but can we,

145
00:06:48,032 --> 00:06:49,951
uh, shut you down?

146
00:06:50,034 --> 00:06:51,160
Yes, great question.

147
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:53,996
There is a kill switch
in a remote sector of the neighborhood

148
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:57,500
in the event that I malfunction
and attempt to harm the residents.

149
00:06:57,583 --> 00:06:59,794
If you press it, I will be destroyed.

150
00:07:00,878 --> 00:07:03,005
-Anything else?
-No, that's good, thanks.

151
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:06,425
-[Janet] Okay.
-Whoa. [stutters] You want to kill Janet?

152
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:08,177
Michael can't retire if he can't leave.

153
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:11,764
He can't leave if there's no Janet
to run the train.

154
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:14,100
It's a perfect solution.

155
00:07:14,225 --> 00:07:15,601
[inhales sharply and sighs]

156
00:07:15,685 --> 00:07:17,019
Janet, high five, please?

157
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:18,521
-[bell chimes]
-Thanks, babe.

158
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:23,151
You cannot kill Janet.

159
00:07:23,234 --> 00:07:28,489
Killing is one of the most famous
moral no-nos.

160
00:07:28,573 --> 00:07:29,699
Janet is a non-human object...

161
00:07:29,782 --> 00:07:31,534
-[scoffs]
-Who was sent here to help us,

162
00:07:31,659 --> 00:07:34,078
and the way she can help us
is if we kill her.

163
00:07:34,162 --> 00:07:37,665
We're doing one small murder-y thing
for a bigger, better reason.

164
00:07:37,748 --> 00:07:41,377
-The ends justify the means.
-Do you know who said that?

165
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:44,380
Was it someone nice and great, like Oprah?

166
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:45,756
It was Machiavelli...

167
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,468
-[sighs]
-A very non-Oprah-like figure.

168
00:07:48,551 --> 00:07:49,719
And what happens after we kill her?

169
00:07:49,802 --> 00:07:53,514
We'll have to lie to everyone
about what we did,

170
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:57,685
and lying is always wrong.

171
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:00,646
[groans]

172
00:08:01,397 --> 00:08:02,607
Why? Why would

173
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:04,108
-I tell Henry that I liked his boots?
-[sighs]

174
00:08:04,192 --> 00:08:06,068
I don't like his boots. I hate his boots.

175
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:09,155
Yes, I know. You've talked about it
for the last two days.

176
00:08:09,238 --> 00:08:12,116
I lied to him.
You wrote your thesis on Kant.

177
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,869
He believed that lying
is always morally wrong...

178
00:08:14,952 --> 00:08:15,953
No exceptions.

179
00:08:16,037 --> 00:08:21,417
Yes, well, Kant was a lonely,
obsessive hermit with zero friends.

180
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:23,211
Sometimes we do thing just to be polite,

181
00:08:23,294 --> 00:08:26,297
but if you really feel that strongly
about it, tell him the truth.

182
00:08:26,881 --> 00:08:29,884
Also, I don't care,
'cause it's the middle of the night.

183
00:08:31,719 --> 00:08:32,720
[sighs]

184
00:08:32,803 --> 00:08:36,057
This is why everyone hates
moral philosophy professors.

185
00:08:37,308 --> 00:08:38,559
They do?

186
00:08:39,602 --> 00:08:41,312
Hey, Chidi.

187
00:08:41,395 --> 00:08:43,356
-You sit in on my class today?
-[stutters] Uh, I did, yeah.

188
00:08:43,439 --> 00:08:45,942
Great lecture, by the way... So bleak.

189
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:47,068
Thanks, bud.

190
00:08:47,151 --> 00:08:50,780
It's actually perfect that you are here.
I got something for you.

191
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:53,449
Oh, my God.

192
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:56,202
You loved mine so much,
I decided to get you your own pair.

193
00:08:56,285 --> 00:08:57,578
We can be boot brothers.

194
00:08:57,662 --> 00:09:00,248
Wow. I can't accept these.
They're too expensive.

195
00:09:00,331 --> 00:09:03,626
Sure you can. Try 'em on, mate.
The fact that you liked mine so much

196
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:06,254
really made me feel like I made
the right choice to buy them.

197
00:09:06,337 --> 00:09:09,799
After all, why should I have
all the fun and boots?

198
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:11,467
-Eh?
-I don't... I don't know.

199
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:15,555
Those look great.

200
00:09:15,638 --> 00:09:17,306
Take 'em for a spin.

201
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:19,809
-Uh...
-You're flying.

202
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:22,395
Mmm! Thanks.

203
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:25,856
[Tahani] Speeches!
Time for speeches, everyone.

204
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:26,941
Michael...

205
00:09:27,024 --> 00:09:28,985
-Huh.
-As someone who didn't exactly have

206
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:30,736
the steadiest parental guidance,

207
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:34,407
I just want to thank you.
You were always there for us.

208
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:37,410
I shouldn't have been. I was the problem.

209
00:09:37,493 --> 00:09:39,370
Yes, but...

210
00:09:39,453 --> 00:09:42,039
It was also great when you weren't there.

211
00:09:42,123 --> 00:09:44,792
Don't worry. Soon I won't be... Forever.

212
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:46,252
Because of The Eternal Shriek!

213
00:09:46,335 --> 00:09:47,753
Yes, thank you, Glenn.

214
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:50,423
[Tahani] Look,
what I'm trying to say is this.

215
00:09:50,506 --> 00:09:56,304
Michael, you always kept us warm and safe
like a bright, glowing sun.

216
00:09:56,387 --> 00:09:58,764
Like the one I kicked the dog into

217
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:02,727
or the one I'm going to be burned
on the surface of for eternity?

218
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:06,480
Okay, no more speeches. Speeches are over.

219
00:10:06,564 --> 00:10:08,482
Michael's going to talk now.

220
00:10:08,691 --> 00:10:11,569
[sighs] I'm sorry I was so grumpy.

221
00:10:11,652 --> 00:10:15,114
It's just I'm sad that I have to leave

222
00:10:15,323 --> 00:10:19,285
before doing all the human things
that I wanted to do.

223
00:10:19,368 --> 00:10:21,787
I wanted to get my hair wet.

224
00:10:21,871 --> 00:10:25,499
You know...
[stutters] I wanted to pull a hamstring.

225
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:29,545
To learn the difference
between "toward" and "towards."

226
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:32,465
[Michael] I wanted to do that thing
where you walk down the hallway,

227
00:10:32,548 --> 00:10:34,842
and someone else is walking the other way,

228
00:10:34,925 --> 00:10:38,054
and then you both lean to one side
and then the other,

229
00:10:38,512 --> 00:10:41,724
and then you both chuckle
over your shared foible.

230
00:10:41,891 --> 00:10:44,310
-[all chuckle]
-I wanted to get a rewards card,

231
00:10:44,393 --> 00:10:46,103
any rewards card.

232
00:10:46,729 --> 00:10:50,107
I wanted to talk briefly
to someone and then say,

233
00:10:50,441 --> 00:10:52,443
"Take it sleazy." [chuckles softly]

234
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:55,946
I wanted to eat a saltine.

235
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:58,366
Oh! I actually have some saltines.

236
00:10:58,449 --> 00:11:00,284
Here, try this.

237
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:04,914
[chomps]

238
00:11:06,207 --> 00:11:07,416
Pretty dry...

239
00:11:08,417 --> 00:11:09,585
And too salty.

240
00:11:10,127 --> 00:11:14,840
Well, going out on a real low note here.
Okay, bye, everyone.

241
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:16,675
Well, take it sleazy.

242
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:18,719
You got to say it?

243
00:11:18,803 --> 00:11:20,805
Yes, but then you say it back.

244
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,849
No, it's not organic.

245
00:11:24,058 --> 00:11:26,644
[soft murmurs]

246
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:31,107
Uh, Janet, how many Janets
have there been?

247
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:33,651
There have been 25 generations of Janet.

248
00:11:33,734 --> 00:11:38,364
Each new update of Janet gains more wisdom
and social abilities.

249
00:11:38,447 --> 00:11:41,283
Fun fact... The first Janet
had a click wheel.

250
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:45,329
So it's like aging for a human?
You're... You're growing up?

251
00:11:45,413 --> 00:11:47,081
That's how I like to think of it, Chidi.

252
00:11:47,164 --> 00:11:50,543
I can't eat, so every time
there's a new version of Janet,

253
00:11:50,626 --> 00:11:55,339
I like to take a piece of birthday cake
and smash it around where my mouth is.

254
00:11:57,383 --> 00:11:59,552
Look, Janet has... Has learned and grown.

255
00:11:59,635 --> 00:12:02,179
She's essentially living a life.
We can't kill her.

256
00:12:02,263 --> 00:12:03,973
Not with that attitude, we can't.

257
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:09,103
Listen, man, I'm dead, you're dead,
we all died, and now we're killing her.

258
00:12:09,437 --> 00:12:10,563
Pay it forward.

259
00:12:10,646 --> 00:12:13,190
No, that's not
what that means at all. Eleanor?

260
00:12:14,275 --> 00:12:15,860
Here we are.

261
00:12:15,943 --> 00:12:18,946
Just press that button,
and it's good-bye, Janet.

262
00:12:19,113 --> 00:12:20,865
[groaning] Uh...

263
00:12:21,031 --> 00:12:24,243
Chidi, I can see that you're worried,
and I just want to assure you,

264
00:12:24,326 --> 00:12:27,246
I am not human, and I cannot feel pain.

265
00:12:27,329 --> 00:12:29,081
Ah. Thank you. That helps.

266
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:30,666
However, I should warn you...

267
00:12:30,749 --> 00:12:32,877
I am programmed with a fail-safe measure.

268
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:36,589
As you approach the kill switch,
I will begin to beg for my life.

269
00:12:36,672 --> 00:12:39,216
It's just there in case
of an accidental shut down,

270
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:41,427
but it will seem very real.

271
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:44,138
Cool. So who's doing this, me or you?

272
00:12:44,221 --> 00:12:46,015
[stutters] Oh, I think I have to.

273
00:12:46,098 --> 00:12:48,684
Um, being a bystander
seems worse, somehow.

274
00:12:49,518 --> 00:12:50,644
[both sigh]

275
00:12:50,728 --> 00:12:52,313
Okay, here we go.

276
00:12:52,897 --> 00:12:56,066
Chidi, no, no, no! Chidi, please!
Please, please, please don't hurt me.

277
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:58,986
-I don't want to die! Please, please...
-[groans]

278
00:12:59,069 --> 00:13:02,573
Again, I am not human. I can't die.

279
00:13:02,656 --> 00:13:05,618
I am simply an anthropomorphized
vessel of knowledge

280
00:13:05,701 --> 00:13:07,995
built to make your life easier.

281
00:13:08,078 --> 00:13:11,457
Your pleading seems so real.

282
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:13,292
Oh, yes, it is a very effective fail-safe.

283
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:17,922
[groans] You want a robot killed right,
you have to do it yourself.

284
00:13:18,005 --> 00:13:19,048
Eleanor? Eleanor, no, no, no.

285
00:13:19,131 --> 00:13:21,300
Please, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Eleanor, I have kids.

286
00:13:21,383 --> 00:13:23,677
I have three beautiful children...

287
00:13:23,802 --> 00:13:26,680
Tyler, Emma, and little,
tiny baby Phillip.

288
00:13:26,764 --> 00:13:29,517
Look at Tyler. Tyler has asthma,
but he is battling it like a champ.

289
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,685
Look at him. No, Eleanor, look at them.

290
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:34,730
[growling] Look at them! Look at them!

291
00:13:34,813 --> 00:13:37,733
-[yelps] It's so realistic!
-Eleanor, again, I'm not human.

292
00:13:37,816 --> 00:13:42,363
This is a stock photo of the crowd
at the Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards.

293
00:13:42,446 --> 00:13:44,698
[sighs] That's right, it's not real.

294
00:13:44,782 --> 00:13:45,950
-Let's just do this.
-[sighs] Right.

295
00:13:46,033 --> 00:13:47,743
Please, I have so much to live for.
No, no, no. Please.

296
00:13:47,826 --> 00:13:48,994
[stutters] We're not even near the...

297
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:52,331
Hey, guys, what's going on?
That party was lame, so I bailed.

298
00:13:52,414 --> 00:13:54,500
Then I saw you, so I followed you here.

299
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:56,544
-Oh, look, a button.
-No, no, no!

300
00:13:56,627 --> 00:13:57,753
Jianyu, no!

301
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:00,548
[Chidi grunts]

302
00:14:07,221 --> 00:14:09,473
Oh, man, I wanted to push that button.

303
00:14:09,557 --> 00:14:11,475
Not cool, dude.

304
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:13,811
Whoa. What happened to Janet?

305
00:14:13,894 --> 00:14:16,855
[stutters] She's dead. I killed her.

306
00:14:16,939 --> 00:14:18,190
Not killed. Remember,

307
00:14:18,274 --> 00:14:21,360
Janet was not a living being,
so she can't be killed.

308
00:14:21,485 --> 00:14:24,321
[Janet through speakers]
<i>Attention... I have been murdered.</i>

309
00:14:24,405 --> 00:14:26,740
<i>Attention... I have been murdered.</i>

310
00:14:26,824 --> 00:14:29,660
<i>Attention... I have been murdered.</i>

311
00:14:29,827 --> 00:14:32,288
<i>Attention... I have been murdered.</i>

312
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:33,330
<i>Attention...</i>

313
00:14:33,414 --> 00:14:35,124
What do we do, Eleanor?

314
00:14:35,332 --> 00:14:38,878
What do we do?
Chidi, you just murdered Janet.

315
00:14:38,961 --> 00:14:40,504
We have to flee your crime scene.

316
00:14:40,588 --> 00:14:41,881
Run!

317
00:14:41,964 --> 00:14:43,048
[Janet] <i>I have been murdered.</i>

318
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:45,718
-Sorry, Janet!
<i>-I have been murdered.</i>

319
00:14:45,843 --> 00:14:47,928
<i>Attention... I have...</i>

320
00:14:49,138 --> 00:14:50,347
<i>Attention...</i>

321
00:14:50,431 --> 00:14:52,099
<i>I have been murdered.</i>

322
00:14:52,641 --> 00:14:55,102
Okay, dude, crash course
in getting away with bad stuff.

323
00:14:55,185 --> 00:14:58,689
You have to act calm and cool
like you don't have a care in the world.

324
00:14:58,772 --> 00:14:59,899
-[Chidi grunts]
-Okay?

325
00:14:59,982 --> 00:15:01,150
Great.

326
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:06,822
Oh, wow. Look, it's<i> Weekend at Bernie's,</i>
'cause you're a dead guy in sunglasses.

327
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:09,033
[laughs] We have fun, don't we, Chidi?

328
00:15:09,116 --> 00:15:11,410
I've never been more stressed
out in my entire life.

329
00:15:11,493 --> 00:15:12,661
Um, I know what you need.

330
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:14,997
Janet, can you get Chidi some weed?

331
00:15:15,623 --> 00:15:19,168
Oh, that's right. You killed Janet.

332
00:15:20,502 --> 00:15:22,212
[Michael] Well, Janet's been murdered.

333
00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:25,299
That's a nice capper
to this wonderful day.

334
00:15:25,466 --> 00:15:27,343
I don't really know what happens now

335
00:15:27,426 --> 00:15:30,763
because... [sighs]
Janet has never been murdered before...

336
00:15:30,846 --> 00:15:33,599
Only today, here on my watch,

337
00:15:33,682 --> 00:15:37,269
while I was distracted with a party
that Tahani was throwing for me,

338
00:15:37,353 --> 00:15:38,687
which I didn't want.

339
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:40,689
Michael, you mustn't blame yourself.

340
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:42,232
I'm not. I'm blaming you.

341
00:15:42,316 --> 00:15:46,278
[Michael] Anyway, what is there to say
about Janet that hasn't already been said

342
00:15:46,362 --> 00:15:49,949
by the giant Janet alarm in the sky?

343
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:52,159
"I've been murdered!"

344
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:53,911
I think that says it all.

345
00:15:54,662 --> 00:15:55,829
-Hello.
-[all gasp]

346
00:15:56,372 --> 00:15:57,665
[gasps]

347
00:15:57,748 --> 00:16:00,000
Janet, you're alive!

348
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:04,546
Hello, Architect,
please enter your four-digit pin.

349
00:16:05,422 --> 00:16:07,049
Uh, what is it? Uh, what is it?

350
00:16:07,132 --> 00:16:08,884
What is it? Oh, right, right, right!

351
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:10,386
It's my, uh, birth year.

352
00:16:10,511 --> 00:16:11,762
-Uh...
-[keypad beeping]

353
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:14,473
I got to change that.
That's too easy to guess.

354
00:16:15,265 --> 00:16:18,519
[exhales] Janet... Who murdered you?

355
00:16:18,602 --> 00:16:19,895
-Oh. Oh, no.
-[shushing] Okay.

356
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:22,606
-Hello.
-Yes, hello.

357
00:16:22,856 --> 00:16:24,191
Oh, yeah.

358
00:16:24,274 --> 00:16:27,027
Uh, her memory
must have been wiped clean...

359
00:16:27,111 --> 00:16:28,737
-[sighs]
-So now she's gonna have

360
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:31,281
to re-upload all the knowledge
in the universe,

361
00:16:31,573 --> 00:16:32,825
which will only take a few days. Okay...

362
00:16:32,908 --> 00:16:34,493
-Hello.
-Hello. [chuckles]

363
00:16:34,576 --> 00:16:36,620
Hello. Hello.

364
00:16:36,704 --> 00:16:39,164
Everyone, um, until I get
to the bottom of this,

365
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:42,543
my retirement is officially postponed.

366
00:16:42,626 --> 00:16:43,877
-Woo!
-[applause]

367
00:16:43,961 --> 00:16:45,921
-[Michael] Oh, oh.
-[laughs]

368
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:48,674
Hello. Hello.

369
00:16:49,466 --> 00:16:52,052
You got to admit... I kind of nailed it.

370
00:16:52,261 --> 00:16:54,680
All we have to do now is keep
the secret forever.

371
00:16:54,763 --> 00:16:56,473
J-Dog, you cool?

372
00:16:56,557 --> 00:17:00,853
No, by the time I got to the piñata,
all the candy was gone.

373
00:17:00,936 --> 00:17:02,646
He's not gonna tell anyone.

374
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:06,358
Chidi? Cheedster?
What's, uh, happening, buddy?

375
00:17:06,442 --> 00:17:10,112
You have a crazy look in your eye,
and you're retreating into your shirt.

376
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:12,072
You're kind of turtling.

377
00:17:13,574 --> 00:17:14,908
-[telephone ringing]
-[EKG machine beeping]

378
00:17:14,992 --> 00:17:16,493
Henry, are you all right? What happened?

379
00:17:16,577 --> 00:17:19,455
I have an aneurysm.
Requires emergency surgery.

380
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:21,206
Doctors' give me a 50/50 chance.

381
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:23,667
So, if there's anything you need
to say to me,

382
00:17:23,751 --> 00:17:25,210
you should do it now. [chuckles]

383
00:17:25,627 --> 00:17:27,171
Oh, well...

384
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,673
Actually, um...

385
00:17:31,925 --> 00:17:33,135
They let you wear your boots in here?

386
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:34,845
They're the only things
that bring me comfort.

387
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:37,806
What did you want to say to me?

388
00:17:38,432 --> 00:17:39,975
Oh, uh...

389
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:43,937
Just that I'm here and I love you, man.

390
00:17:44,021 --> 00:17:47,107
I love you, too, boot brother.

391
00:17:47,191 --> 00:17:49,318
Oh... Okay.

392
00:17:51,445 --> 00:17:52,738
Chidi!

393
00:17:52,821 --> 00:17:55,407
You didn't have to stay here all night.

394
00:17:55,491 --> 00:17:57,159
So surgery went well? All clear?

395
00:17:57,242 --> 00:17:58,827
Right as rain, buddy.

396
00:17:58,952 --> 00:18:02,706
That is so, so, so great.

397
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:04,708
-I hate your boots.
-What?

398
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:07,044
I told you that I loved
your boots three years ago,

399
00:18:07,127 --> 00:18:10,297
and I was lying,
and that lie has haunted me ever since,

400
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:11,965
and people tried to tell me it was fine...

401
00:18:12,049 --> 00:18:14,009
Just a nice, little white lie
in the form of social niceties...

402
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:15,385
But I disagreed, and then yesterday

403
00:18:15,469 --> 00:18:17,596
I thought you were gonna die,
but now you're not dead,

404
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:19,056
and I can finally be honest

405
00:18:19,139 --> 00:18:21,558
and say that those boots
are terrible and hideous

406
00:18:21,642 --> 00:18:23,268
and I hate them.

407
00:18:24,228 --> 00:18:25,312
Whoo!

408
00:18:26,647 --> 00:18:30,234
This is why everyone hates
moral philosophy professors.

409
00:18:30,317 --> 00:18:33,237
Yeah, I know. And I get it.

410
00:18:34,404 --> 00:18:38,575
I don't care that she came back
or that we did it for a good reason.

411
00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:40,244
I can't live with this lie.

412
00:18:40,327 --> 00:18:42,079
I'm going to confess
to the murder of Janet.

413
00:18:42,371 --> 00:18:43,372
[laughs]

414
00:18:44,665 --> 00:18:45,833
What?

415
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:48,627
Dude, why?

416
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:50,462
Janet is fine.

417
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:51,964
We didn't harm her at all.

418
00:18:52,047 --> 00:18:54,174
We didn't? Hey, Janet?

419
00:18:54,258 --> 00:18:55,467
-[bell chimes]
-[Janet] Hello.

420
00:18:55,551 --> 00:18:56,718
-Hello.
-[Janet] Hello.

421
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:59,805
Janet, would you please recite
the English alphabet?

422
00:18:59,888 --> 00:19:01,890
A-B...

423
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:03,016
Janet.

424
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:04,226
She knows her A-B-Janets.

425
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:07,229
She literally knew everything
in the universe,

426
00:19:07,312 --> 00:19:08,647
and now she's a baby.

427
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:11,525
And even if she were okay,
it would be too painful for me

428
00:19:11,608 --> 00:19:13,068
to live with these lies.

429
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:17,322
What are you talking about?
It is so easy to live with a lie.

430
00:19:17,781 --> 00:19:19,992
I once pretended
to have a terminal illness

431
00:19:20,075 --> 00:19:22,077
to meet Scott Wolf at a Sunglass Hut.

432
00:19:23,245 --> 00:19:24,746
Victimless crime.

433
00:19:25,455 --> 00:19:26,832
Fine.

434
00:19:26,915 --> 00:19:29,585
I won't say anything
because I promised to help you.

435
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:32,129
-And the moral implications...
-[sighs]

436
00:19:32,212 --> 00:19:34,256
Of everything that we've done
are so complicated

437
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:37,342
that I may never untangle them,
but I hate lying.

438
00:19:37,426 --> 00:19:38,552
I always have,

439
00:19:38,635 --> 00:19:41,471
and this is going
to eat me up inside forever.

440
00:19:41,555 --> 00:19:44,600
You might be able to shrug this off,
and forget about it, but I never will.

441
00:19:47,978 --> 00:19:49,062
Hello.

442
00:19:50,105 --> 00:19:51,398
-Hi.
-Hello.

443
00:19:52,357 --> 00:19:54,526
-Hi.
-Hello.

444
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:56,195
Jianyu!

445
00:19:57,404 --> 00:20:00,115
{\an8}Michael, Janet said you wanted
to speak to me.

446
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:01,950
{\an8}Well, actually,
she was just drooling a lot

447
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:06,038
{\an8}and saying, "Hello" over and over again,
but she did point at you.

448
00:20:06,371 --> 00:20:08,165
{\an8}I owe you an apology.

449
00:20:08,248 --> 00:20:09,875
{\an8}Oh, no. No, you don't.

450
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:12,586
{\an8}No... But, uh, please continue.

451
00:20:13,128 --> 00:20:14,713
{\an8}You were only trying to help.

452
00:20:14,796 --> 00:20:17,216
{\an8}You're a wonderful person,

453
00:20:17,299 --> 00:20:20,052
{\an8}and if I ever do have a retirement party,

454
00:20:20,135 --> 00:20:21,303
{\an8}I hope you plan it.

455

I want to keep you all updated.

Here's what we know.

460

-Oh, boy.
-Okay, easy.

I assume that this horrifying act

464
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:44,076
is somehow related to
the other issues we've had here.

465
00:20:44,451 --> 00:20:47,955
It also means
that the problems in this neighborhood

466

are not 100% my fault.

467

There is something else at work here.
